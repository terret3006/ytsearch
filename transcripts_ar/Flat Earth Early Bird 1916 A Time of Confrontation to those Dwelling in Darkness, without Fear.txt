today is well it is really

100.28 --> 107.0
warm but

103.24 --> 109.56
uh yeah not a lot of Blue Sky

107.0 --> 111.719
happening it's kind of weird it was a

109.56 --> 114.71900000000001
little bit more blue skyed but then it

111.719 --> 116.79899999999999
just hazed over there's also still a lot

114.719 --> 118.83999999999999
of wind out

116.799 --> 121.68
there

118.84 --> 124.60000000000001
occasionally these big gusts of wind

121.68 --> 124.60000000000001
just keep popping

126.159 --> 131.20000000000002

[Music]

140.28 --> 148.12
there right so hello Clary first in chat

144.879 --> 151.2
good to see you Gary Fe good to see

148.12 --> 154.16
you invited to the final experiment I

151.2 --> 157.0
have no idea what that is so I'm

154.16 --> 161.12
guessing no

157.0 --> 163.56
Gary right it is Saturday the 6th of

161.12 --> 163.56
April

168.92 --> 175.28
2024 temperature is 23Â°

178.56 --> 184.519
C with

181.04 --> 188.72
45% humidity

184.519 --> 191.20000000000002
still 26 kilm an hour wind right yeah

188.72 --> 191.2
that makes

193.0 --> 197.76
sense looks

195.159 --> 203.959
like coming week it's going to be

197.76 --> 203.959
between 20 and 13Â°

204.879 --> 211.319

211.319 --> 217.599
uh it this

214.04 --> 217.599

organized out there

273.199 --> 277.16

[Music]

446.72 --> 451.52000000000004
yet

448.52 --> 451.52
right

453.199 --> 459.039

456.8 --> 462.319
kind of hot weather as well in

459.039 --> 462.31899999999996
the in

464.919 --> 473.479
England seem to be mostly like the the

468.759 --> 473.47900000000004
Heatwave thing seem to be mostly

473.759 --> 481.44
around the Europe

477.08 --> 481.44
mainland from the charts that I've seen

486.24 --> 492.159
like surrounding Switzerland pretty much

489.639 --> 492.159
it's kind of

497.84 --> 501.19899999999996
weird hello

508.44 --> 511.44
mango

520.8 --> 527.959
right yeserday was kind

523.039 --> 531.959
of a slow day but the uh the PDF that I

527.959 --> 535.16
shared did was it was interesting I did

531.959 --> 537.8389999999999
actually end up looking through it

535.16 --> 540.12
partially motivated by a whole bunch of

537.839 --> 541.7600000000001
responses I got

540.12 --> 545.32
in the comment

541.76 --> 547.8
section that were just apparently

545.32 --> 547.8000000000001
there's a

547.839 --> 553.2790000000001
thing anti-

550.839 --> 554.9200000000001
giantism people just can't handle that

553.279 --> 557.48
it's

554.92 --> 561.4799999999999
real and they were saying like oh no

557.48 --> 561.48
it's all fake and this and

562.24 --> 568.36
that but they were liter yeah I I read

565.519 --> 571.6
through it and they were just

568.36 --> 577.36
wrong cuz there was a hypothetical

571.6 --> 581.2
mention in it about how the Indians had

577.36 --> 584.24
burial rights to cover to cover the

581.2 --> 586.6400000000001
buried in ochre and all

584.24 --> 589.839
that

586.64 --> 592.36
but that's the Indian burrow

589.839 --> 595.6800000000001
right and not these Giants and there's

592.36 --> 599.88
no mention that that's actually been

595.68 --> 603.959
proven to be the case but apparently

599.88 --> 607.2
just a mere hypothetical mention of of

603.959 --> 611.0
that potentially being used to color

607.2 --> 613.2
things red is enough for Skeptics to

611.0 --> 616.76
just go with it and like no they they

613.2 --> 618.0
weren't even redheaded like yeah yeah

616.76 --> 621.64
they

618.0 --> 621.64
were definitely

621.839 --> 627.44
were so I had a bit of back and forth in

625.44 --> 631.8000000000001
the comment section yesterday and hey I

627.44 --> 636.12
do like that I mean there skeptical

631.8 --> 636.12
[Â __Â ] but it's kind of fun

637.0 --> 644.24
just just digging through it

640.12 --> 646.92
and just realizing how they let their

644.24 --> 650.16
own skepticism just blind

646.92 --> 650.16
themselves it's

652.8 --> 658.24
hilarious yeah redheaded Giants in

655.56 --> 661.2399999999999
America very

658.24 --> 661.24
real

666.18 --> 671.3599999999999
[Music]

668.48 --> 671.36
so that was kind of

687.079 --> 691.959
fun right but I guess

689.92 --> 694.68
there's just people out there that

691.959 --> 697.68
pretty much no what no matter what I say

694.68 --> 701.76
they just are going to say it's all

697.68 --> 701.76
wrong pretty much no matter

701.839 --> 709.8800000000001
what I don't even know

704.56 --> 709.88
why why they take the effort to do

718.24 --> 721.24
that

722.24 --> 729.32
right

724.32 --> 729.32
uh right don't really have a

735.839 --> 740.0400000000001
subject nothing really stood

742.32 --> 748.1600000000001
out enough for me to be able to like dig

745.8 --> 751.16
into it as a

748.16 --> 751.16
subject

768.839 --> 776.24
overall there is a a general

773.32 --> 780.12
progress in

776.24 --> 782.639
uh cracking down on the perpetrators of

780.12 --> 785.12
the medical experimentation that has

782.639 --> 788.0790000000001
been subjected to the

785.12 --> 790.5600000000001
world there is like it just keeps on

788.079 --> 790.56
going the

790.8 --> 798.4799999999999
Crackdown and it's more like it's it's

796.0 --> 800.24
getting almost mainstream it's still

798.48 --> 803.16
being denied it's

800.24 --> 805.279
just it's getting into the attention a

803.16 --> 806.88
lot which is great which means that

805.279 --> 809.68
there's going

806.88 --> 814.72
to at this point definitely

809.68 --> 814.7199999999999
be a consequence to it one way or the

820.519 --> 825.88
other at the same time also

823.88 --> 829.399
like

825.88 --> 832.759
the popular opinion is like really

829.399 --> 835.36
turning against Israel badly for their

832.759 --> 835.36
overall

837.24 --> 842.72
behavior in the last few months like

840.36 --> 845.48
that's not that I am like personally

842.72 --> 848.9200000000001
invested in that in any kind of way but

845.48 --> 848.9200000000001
it is kind of standing out

854.399 --> 859.48
that that whatever they tried they tried

857.36 --> 861.9590000000001
it they were just

859.48 --> 864.12
trying and they didn't really get away

861.959 --> 864.1199999999999
with

864.8 --> 871.04
it like people are sick of it everything

868.68 --> 871.04
they do

871.12 --> 876.44
and and Aid workers getting blown up and

874.199 --> 876.4399999999999
all

878.56 --> 884.0999999999999
that so that's that's a development

882.759 --> 887.309
that's

884.1 --> 887.309
[Music]

889.56 --> 892.92
[Music]

898.04 --> 901.04
ongoing

922.639 --> 927.279
right so yeah Gary Fe could you

924.56 --> 931.319
enlighten me what you're talking

927.279 --> 935.24
about supposed final experiment is this

931.319 --> 938.88
about measuring some curvature or

935.24 --> 938.88
something what are you talking

942.8 --> 948.399
about or is this just a hi hello I'm

946.56 --> 950.68
going to just say hello and something

948.399 --> 954.399
and then just like do other stuff for

950.68 --> 954.399
half an hour and just not say

954.48 --> 959.12
anything you're going to get me all

956.839 --> 960.8000000000001
worked up and pissed off for nobody

959.12 --> 962.319
actually saying anything is it going to

960.8 --> 966.199
be one of those

962.319 --> 968.7199999999999
shows cuz I did not like that

966.199 --> 971.24
yesterday and I'm going to continue not

968.72 --> 971.24
liking

974.959 --> 979.399
that I'd like to have a conversation

977.639 --> 982.8
with

979.399 --> 986.319
people in my

982.8 --> 988.519
chat and i' potentially love to have a

986.319 --> 992.4799999999999
conversation with somebody that might

988.519 --> 995.92
even get on my show with me in

992.48 --> 1001.88
voice maybe call in on

995.92 --> 1001.88
Skype that's just fine I'm open to

1012.199 --> 1016.3599999999999
that

1013.72 --> 1018.12
right maybe somebody out there is still

1016.36 --> 1021.24
very concerned about the whole

1018.12 --> 1024.72
development in the United

1021.24 --> 1028.839
States maybe they still have some fears

1024.72 --> 1032.079
here and there that I might help

1028.839 --> 1034.319
dispel that would be something that I

1032.079 --> 1034.319
can

1040.0 --> 1046.959
do also I figured out interesting

1043.959 --> 1050.8400000000001
applications for the

1046.959 --> 1050.8400000000001
technique it's weird it's

1058.52 --> 1063.8799999999999
different I've discovered that if

1061.24 --> 1066.1200000000001
there's like some rowdiness going on and

1063.88 --> 1069.3200000000002
some like people

1066.12 --> 1071.3999999999999
dwelling sliding off and then a group

1069.32 --> 1074.12
effect happening with that that's like

1071.4 --> 1077.3600000000001
disturbing so like a disturbance

1074.12 --> 1080.52
happening I can basically neutralize

1077.36 --> 1083.36
that at a distance

1080.52 --> 1086.679
using the technique and it's not even

1083.36 --> 1090.28
like explicitly

1086.679 --> 1094.159
asking to neutralize it it's just doing

1090.28 --> 1096.559
it on myself like almost reversing the

1094.159 --> 1098.8400000000001
influence that the situation is having

1096.559 --> 1098.84
On

1099.24 --> 1106.44
Me by just neutralizing it with me as it

1102.88 --> 1109.5590000000002
is influencing me seems to

1106.44 --> 1112.679
like give a feedback of

1109.559 --> 1114.48
effect that then neutralizes it and

1112.679 --> 1116.5590000000002
that's very interesting and I'm going to

1114.48 --> 1121.96
get my Illuminati C on now somebody

1116.559 --> 1121.96
better damn well start speaking up in my

1137.72 --> 1140.72

1370.32 --> 1375.52
government the people that are

appoint somebody to freaking burn at the

1378.88 --> 1383.48
stakes very

1380.84 --> 1386.08
quickly or there's a good chance that

1383.48 --> 1387.64
like like the entire country is going to

1386.08 --> 1390.24
go to

1387.64 --> 1393.039
[Â __Â ] that there's going to be a massive

1390.24 --> 1395.48
war from all sides all of a sudden and

1393.039 --> 1397.32
then with all their [Â __Â ] Advanced

1395.48 --> 1400.159
weaponry and all that it's not going to

1397.32 --> 1404.48
matter CU they're all going to die then

1400.159 --> 1404.48
if they don't do something about this

1407.44 --> 1410.44
[Â __Â ]

1412.279 --> 1417.32
I mean they're Waging War with modern

1415.0 --> 1420.08
Weaponry like it's freaking medieval

1417.32 --> 1423.799
times or something and it's like

1420.08 --> 1426.799
people nobody in the world is accepting

1423.799 --> 1426.799
it

1429.12 --> 1435.799
nobody just the indiscriminate killing

1432.72 --> 1437.44
of Aid workers from around the

1435.799 --> 1439.559
world

1437.44 --> 1442.64
it's

1439.559 --> 1446.1589999999999
there's very little lines that they can

1442.64 --> 1448.919
still cross at this

1446.159 --> 1451.24
point they've pretty much crossed all of

1448.919 --> 1451.24
them

1454.799 --> 1462.08
already so yeah they better just finish

1458.6 --> 1465.12
what they started go out with drone

1462.08 --> 1467.559
swarms and people with flamethrowers and

1465.12 --> 1471.08
just exterminate every single

1467.559 --> 1475.12
Palestinian that left very

1471.08 --> 1475.12
quickly or end this

1476.08 --> 1481.6789999999999
[Â __Â ] cuz that is what they intend to do

1479.32 --> 1484.12
yeah they do intend to completely

1481.679 --> 1487.1200000000001
genocide that entire

1484.12 --> 1489.4399999999998
people they've openly stated that that

1487.12 --> 1492.84
is what they are going to do and that is

1489.44 --> 1496.159
what they are doing and nobody's buying

1492.84 --> 1499.24
it nobody's accepting

1496.159 --> 1501.279
it everybody kind of took it as a bluff

1499.24 --> 1503.32
but they're just doing it and they're

1501.279 --> 1506.039
like killing everyone and everything

1503.32 --> 1509.6789999999999
alongside

1506.039 --> 1511.679
it and the world's sick of it like

1509.679 --> 1515.0
there's not going to be any people left

1511.679 --> 1517.3600000000001
that are going to accept [Â __Â ] Israel

1515.0 --> 1517.36
after

1524.21 --> 1530.32
[Music]

1526.72 --> 1530.32
this all right

1537.08 --> 1545.6399999999999
anyway I mean seriously like if you're

1541.44 --> 1548.76
actually a good Jew an important Jew a

1545.64 --> 1552.0
functional Jew you're Israel dude at

1548.76 --> 1555.64
this point I'd [Â __Â ] flee your country

1552.0 --> 1559.039
I'd flee I get the hell out of

1555.64 --> 1561.72
there cuz if this pressure keeps up

1559.039 --> 1565.039
it's all going to be destroyed like

1561.72 --> 1568.159
every single [Â __Â ] part about it like

1565.039 --> 1571.919
nobody will give a [Â __Â ] about your oh

1568.159 --> 1574.64
we're so Advanced oh we we make the

1571.919 --> 1576.7990000000002
country better no no everybody will be

1574.64 --> 1579.039
so sick of it they'll never like there

1576.799 --> 1582.12
will be like a permanent boycott on

1579.039 --> 1582.12
anything Israel

1587.24 --> 1593.679
forever

1590.2 --> 1593.679
nobody's going to accept

1594.159 --> 1598.0390000000002
anything if I were the Jews over there

1596.919 --> 1601.039
is

1598.039 --> 1603.44
like take your government down or get

1601.039 --> 1607.6
the hell out of there as quick as you

1603.44 --> 1610.96
can cuz this place is going to blow up

1607.6 --> 1610.9599999999998
metaphysically or

1616.06 --> 1620.24
[Music]

1617.24 --> 1620.24
literally

1626.039 --> 1631.2
full of hatred I'm not it's not hatred

1628.96 --> 1631.2
it's

1631.559 --> 1639.76
just it's pure

1635.12 --> 1641.799
Aron I mean they're doing it not because

1639.76 --> 1644.2
they hate they're doing it because

1641.799 --> 1644.2
they're

1644.24 --> 1649.48
just soulless robots at this point

1647.6 --> 1652.48
purely

1649.48 --> 1652.48
aromantic

1652.76 --> 1658.08
ponds just doing it and like they're

1655.559 --> 1661.1589999999999
laughing about it as they're doing

1658.08 --> 1663.519
it not because they love it but because

1661.159 --> 1666.24
they can't believe they they're just

1663.519 --> 1666.24
doing all of

1666.559 --> 1672.44
it I mean these soldiers there they must

1669.799 --> 1675.2
it must feel to them like they're just

1672.44 --> 1678.96
they can't distinguish whether it's a

1675.2 --> 1681.44
video game anymore or reality

1678.96 --> 1683.44
and that's probably why they're laughing

1681.44 --> 1685.72
because that type of laughing is exactly

1683.44 --> 1688.519
the type of laugh that you have when you

1685.72 --> 1690.6000000000001
play video game and you just egregiously

1688.519 --> 1694.32
blow up a building or something right

1690.6 --> 1697.399
you're like ho whoa yeah because you

1694.32 --> 1699.279
think it's a video game that's what this

1697.399 --> 1702.1589999999999
what is happening in

1699.279 --> 1706.039
Israel they're like

1702.159 --> 1708.3990000000001
completely losing their sense of

1706.039 --> 1710.8799999999999
reality playing it out like it's it's a

1708.399 --> 1712.1999999999998
video game it's like yep yeah we have to

1710.88 --> 1714.919
erase all the

1712.2 --> 1716.64
enemies like no matter what doesn't

1714.919 --> 1717.7990000000002
doesn't matter if they're [Â __Â ] babies

1716.64 --> 1721.8400000000001
or

1717.799 --> 1721.84
whatever just blow it all

1731.08 --> 1737.519
up can you imagine what would

1734.6 --> 1738.84
happen when they actually reach that

1737.519 --> 1741.1200000000001
point

1738.84 --> 1743.72
where they finished

1741.12 --> 1745.76
that can you imagine what's going to

1743.72 --> 1750.3600000000001
happen to

1745.76 --> 1753.679
them when they end that cycle when they

1750.36 --> 1755.4399999999998
like murdered the last Palestinian baby

1753.679 --> 1759.76
can you imagine what's going to happen

1755.44 --> 1762.3200000000002
then after that point like to them once

1759.76 --> 1767.039
there's some kind of room some way to

1762.32 --> 1770.039
start letting it sink in what they've

1767.039 --> 1770.039
done

1770.64 --> 1779.2
yeah I think that the overall suicide

1775.0 --> 1781.12
rates among IDF members is going to be

1779.2 --> 1784.44
setting a world

1781.12 --> 1788.32
record that's what I think is going to

1784.44 --> 1792.44
happen world record suicide rate that's

1788.32 --> 1792.4399999999998
what's going to happen after they're

1797.039 --> 1800.039
done

1814.279 --> 1819.36
yeah and there will have be they will

1816.08 --> 1821.6399999999999
get no mercy either I mean those IDF

1819.36 --> 1823.6
people I mean if they're going to be

1821.64 --> 1825.44
like oh I can't live with this anymore

1823.6 --> 1826.799
people are going to be yeah yeah kill

1825.44 --> 1830.24
yourself

1826.799 --> 1832.24
yeah yeah get on with it you genocided

1830.24 --> 1836.08
an entire people including little

1832.24 --> 1837.799
children and babies do it that's what's

1836.08 --> 1842.6789999999999
going to happen I won't be saying that

1837.799 --> 1842.679
to them but people out there

1842.96 --> 1849.3600000000001
will you brought this on

1846.48 --> 1852.96
yourself you had a window of opportunity

1849.36 --> 1854.84
to take down the arch criminal that put

1852.96 --> 1859.279
you in

1854.84 --> 1862.399
this I gave all of Israel a warning when

1859.279 --> 1864.6
this all started what should happen to

1862.399 --> 1868.6
deescalate

1864.6 --> 1871.32
this they didn't do it no no they they

1868.6 --> 1871.32
just went for

1881.88 --> 1888.679
it kind of a dark start to a Saturday

1884.519 --> 1890.88
morning it's not your bad Richard G

1888.679 --> 1892.6390000000001
hey at least there's something moving

1890.88 --> 1894.5590000000002
you know what it's a bad start me

1892.639 --> 1898.32
starting to

1894.559 --> 1901.96
talk and then within the first 20

1898.32 --> 1904.519
minutes having 11 minutes of silence

1901.96 --> 1907.279
between somebody saying anything in chat

1904.519 --> 1907.279
that's a bad

1908.24 --> 1913.76
start this is a controversial subject

1911.639 --> 1918.7199999999998
that normally I don't really like to

1913.76 --> 1920.8799999999999
bring up because it's rough but

1918.72 --> 1922.519
why not why not just do it I was in a

1920.88 --> 1927.1200000000001
cranky mood

1922.519 --> 1927.1200000000001
anyway oh hold on I need to kick out a

1931.47 --> 1934.599
[Music]

1946.84 --> 1949.84

2013.0 --> 2017.559
you was just on my mind yeah that's

2020.519 --> 2028.159
fine I mean I've been trying to

2023.399 --> 2031.08
be very positive non-fear overall right

2028.159 --> 2033.48
but being non-fear around this period

2031.08 --> 2036.1999999999998
doesn't mean that we can't

2033.48 --> 2038.6
address things that are happening that

2036.2 --> 2040.799
are terrible

2038.6 --> 2043.24
it just means don't be

2040.799 --> 2047.0
afraid right don't be afraid doesn't

2043.24 --> 2050.76
mean don't get into dark things it just

2047.0 --> 2054.72
means don't be afraid of dark

2050.76 --> 2057.28
things but that can also mean don't

2054.72 --> 2061.48
avoid the dark

2057.28 --> 2064.2000000000003
things because you're afraid of

2061.48 --> 2064.2
addressing

2064.8 --> 2072.599
it so I thank you rery for bringing it

2070.0 --> 2075.839
up needs to be brought up I mean it's

2072.599 --> 2078.2000000000003
happening it's it's just

2101.0 --> 2107.44
forcing people to take the medical

2103.72 --> 2110.48

2107.44 --> 2113.119
haunted by Italians like everywhere he

2353.28 --> 2360.0
time of Confrontation to those dwelling

in darkness think that kind of applies a

2365.359 --> 2373.319
little right don't forget to Rogan it

2370.48 --> 2376.2400000000002
up I feel like having another freaking

2373.319 --> 2376.24
coffee after this

2377.319 --> 2382.56
one first let's take a bite out of this

2396.319 --> 2399.319
cheers

2400.359 --> 2403.839
I've noticed something really

2404.96 --> 2411.52
weird about my tentis

2408.52 --> 2411.52
like

2412.4 --> 2418.64
effect I've noticed that angry

2416.16 --> 2423.04
confrontation

2418.64 --> 2423.04
actually makes the ttis go

2424.04 --> 2429.04
away you'd think it would be the

2426.64 --> 2432.359
opposite but it

2429.04 --> 2432.359
isn't kind of

2443.8 --> 2448.3590000000004
weird what did

2449.24 --> 2453.839
Hamas I don't think Hamas is a

2451.76 --> 2455.96
legitimate Palestinian

2453.839 --> 2459.599
organization I think Hamas is a

2455.96 --> 2463.119
controlled opposition agent that's there

2459.599 --> 2466.56
purely to justify Israel's genocide on

2463.119 --> 2470.2400000000002
the Palestinian people Fester from

2466.56 --> 2475.52
Lester that's what I think

2470.24 --> 2479.7999999999997
yeah name me one damn thing that Hamas

2475.52 --> 2483.44
has ever done for the Palestinian people

2479.8 --> 2486.04
that was of an advantage for the

2483.44 --> 2489.599
Palestinian

2486.04 --> 2493.2
people what one [Â __Â ] thing that they

2489.599 --> 2493.2000000000003
ever did for them

2497.0 --> 2502.0
yeah

2498.72 --> 2504.319
nothing nothing they've done nothing but

2571.599 --> 2574.599
is a legitimate

2576.119 --> 2579.119
organization

2600.839 --> 2606.119
like oh they did it they didn't I don't

2605.119 --> 2609.119

2612.76 --> 2620.8
supposedly did I mean Israel IDF

2616.76 --> 2624.1600000000003
themselves had at this point killed more

2620.8 --> 2627.319
Israelis that were hostages to the

2624.16 --> 2630.24
supposed Hamas people then Hamas has

2627.319 --> 2633.44
ever killed Israelis I mean this is all

2630.24 --> 2633.4399999999996
just completely

2636.04 --> 2641.0
ridiculous

2638.359 --> 2643.7999999999997

2658.31 --> 2661.54
[Music]

2662.72 --> 2669.839
right I mean at this point just be

2665.76 --> 2669.8390000000004
honest just be

2676.64 --> 2683.24
honest like the amount

2678.92 --> 2686.04
of hostages that IDF has just like blown

2683.24 --> 2690.16
up alongside supposed Hamas at this

2686.04 --> 2692.8
point is larger than the initial amount

2690.16 --> 2695.04
of casualties that the Hamas attack

2692.8 --> 2699.04
supposedly

2695.04 --> 2699.04
made this is all

2706.79 --> 2709.909
[Music]

2725.96 --> 2728.96
insane

2729.64 --> 2739.72
blowing up their own hostages their own

2734.24 --> 2739.72
citizens blowing up International Aid

2743.64 --> 2746.7599999999998
workers I

2750.68 --> 2754.04
mean what's

2755.64 --> 2762.1189999999997
next all right there any lines left to

2759.0 --> 2762.119
cross at this

2766.0 --> 2770.44
point I mean the only thing I can

2768.28 --> 2774.0
imagine at this point is that they just

2770.44 --> 2776.96
go out straight out

2774.0 --> 2779.28
firebombing citizens like entire like

2776.96 --> 2782.44
not just blowing it up but just like

2779.28 --> 2785.559
burning it all down or using chemical

2782.44 --> 2787.88
weapons or something like I mean you

2785.559 --> 2790.88
have to really make effort to find

2787.88 --> 2791.92
another line to cross here Israel really

2790.88 --> 2795.839
you

2791.92 --> 2798.64
do but I'll bet you'll be able to do it

2795.839 --> 2798.64
cuz it's what you

2799.13 --> 2802.389
[Music]

2806.68 --> 2812.1189999999997
do the PDF F line I don't know what that

2814.319 --> 2818.839
means all right see you later Richard G

2843.48 --> 2849.76
but I I can think of another line that

2846.92 --> 2849.76
the idea of could

2850.92 --> 2856.599
cross how

2852.599 --> 2859.119
about just murdering Palestinian

2856.599 --> 2863.119
families that have actually fled to

2859.119 --> 2866.0
foreign Nations and just

2863.119 --> 2867.8
killed babies in other countries

2866.0 --> 2870.96
Palestinian

2867.8 --> 2874.599
babies maybe people that would have like

2870.96 --> 2878.28
adopted Palestinian babies or whatever

2874.599 --> 2880.3590000000004
and then just like drone strike those

2878.28 --> 2882.0400000000004
families that have like adopted a bunch

2880.359 --> 2884.24
of kids and oh there were some

2882.04 --> 2887.48
Palestinian babies in there maybe just

2884.24 --> 2890.2799999999997
burn it all down maybe that's another

2887.48 --> 2893.04
line that they could cross just handing

2890.28 --> 2893.0400000000004
out some more

2893.119 --> 2900.52
suggestions I mean we all know you're

2896.76 --> 2903.599
always looking for more horrendous lines

2900.52 --> 2905.7599999999998
to cross don't

2903.599 --> 2907.96
you there you

2905.76 --> 2911.3590000000004
go

2907.96 --> 2911.359
here's another line you can

2919.62 --> 2922.739
[Music]

2928.04 --> 2934.7599999999998
cross or or maybe you could use the

2930.96 --> 2939.2
financial system to track down who had

2934.76 --> 2942.599
the goal to adopt Palestinian babies and

2939.2 --> 2945.48
then just like debank them or something

2942.599 --> 2947.2000000000003
like oh oh you had a Palestinian baby

2945.48 --> 2950.4
adopted

2947.2 --> 2954.52
well you can't use your bank account

2950.4 --> 2957.319
anymore you can't buy anymore food cuz

2954.52 --> 2959.48
how dare you adopt a Palestinian baby

2957.319 --> 2962.88
maybe that's a line you could cross you

2959.48 --> 2965.72
we know you can do it Israel we know you

2962.88 --> 2968.7200000000003
can do that go

2965.72 --> 2968.72
ahead

2971.799 --> 2976.559
yeah let's see how far you can take this

2991.839 --> 2998.64
thing stop giving them ideas

2995.64 --> 2998.64
why

3000.359 --> 3007.64
they're going to do it

3003.079 --> 3007.6400000000003
anyway I'm just giving you guys heads

3020.76 --> 3029.079
up hey clutch good to see

3024.079 --> 3029.079
you you're just joking that's

3032.76 --> 3038.6400000000003
fine but I mean let's just recognize

3036.0 --> 3041.839
that the Israeli government

3038.64 --> 3044.92
is openly

3041.839 --> 3047.72
genocidal yeah this whole joke the

3044.92 --> 3050.2400000000002
running joke with Owen

3047.72 --> 3053.64
Benjamin what he used to say he's not

3050.24 --> 3055.4799999999996
saying it anymore now is he why because

3053.64 --> 3057.44
it's not funny anymore because they're

3055.48 --> 3060.2
actually doing it

3057.44 --> 3063.319
now yeah but even a year ago was

3060.2 --> 3065.96
remember what's next

3063.319 --> 3068.48
genocide right oh that was so funny back

3065.96 --> 3071.7200000000003
then yeah it's not funny anymore though

3068.48 --> 3076.04
because they're actually just doing it

3071.72 --> 3076.04
now like overt

3079.44 --> 3085.119
monsters yeah and they're like not even

3082.76 --> 3088.76
flinching about

3085.119 --> 3092.0
it they're like yeah genocide we're

3088.76 --> 3096.079
committing genocide what you going to do

3092.0 --> 3096.079
what you going to do when we burn the

3097.559 --> 3104.1600000000003
babies it's where we're at so that

3101.0 --> 3107.64
joke's ruined they ruined the

3104.16 --> 3111.24
joke they ruined the joke based on a

3107.64 --> 3111.24
Trope that they would

3111.96 --> 3117.2
say because of their own conditioning

3115.44 --> 3120.599
their own victim condition

3117.2 --> 3123.64
conditioning and now they are doing that

3120.599 --> 3126.0
thing that they were conditioned was

3123.64 --> 3131.839
going to happen to them now they are the

3126.0 --> 3131.839
monsters that they thought were after

3145.52 --> 3148.52
them

3149.67 --> 3152.7690000000002
[Music]

3166.28 --> 3171.6800000000003
it just the whole

3168.16 --> 3175.44
thing looks and feels to me like they're

3171.68 --> 3178.44
playing Russian roulette until it

3175.44 --> 3178.44
pops

3187.11 --> 3190.289
[Music]

3203.97 --> 3208.4399999999996
[Music]

3205.44 --> 3208.44
for

3235.44 --> 3238.44
for

3250.64 --> 3255.92
there will be a time when all nations

3252.76 --> 3260.6800000000003
turn against Israel right but I

3255.92 --> 3260.6800000000003
mean what is Israel though in the

3261.599 --> 3266.559
Bible is this Israel the Israel of the

3264.68 --> 3268.48
Bible clutch that's the question you

3266.559 --> 3271.76
know there's a lot of people that say

3268.48 --> 3271.76
that it blatantly

3295.319 --> 3298.319
isn't

3298.64 --> 3305.359
right you like just look and think about

3302.079 --> 3310.2400000000002
what Israel is supposed to be standing

3305.359 --> 3313.96
for right what if you

3310.24 --> 3313.9599999999996
saw current

3315.24 --> 3321.72
Russia as

3317.88 --> 3321.7200000000003
Israel based on

3324.559 --> 3332.4
behaviors like what if Russia is the

3328.88 --> 3334.839
Israel that is talked of in the Bible

3332.4 --> 3334.839
about the

3335.839 --> 3341.7599999999998
future isn't like the freaking world

3340.44 --> 3344.76
turning

3341.76 --> 3344.76
against

3350.5 --> 3355.88
[Music]

3352.119 --> 3358.2400000000002
Russia Israel is the new turkey what

3355.88 --> 3358.2400000000002
does that

3358.559 --> 3365.3190000000004
mean what's a how is Turkey in that

3372.359 --> 3378.7599999999998
sense but if you're referencing that

3376.079 --> 3380.88
turkey has this past of the Armenian

3378.76 --> 3384.2400000000002
Genocide and all that

3380.88 --> 3386.079
then yeah in a way Israel is becoming

3384.24 --> 3389.0389999999998
like that like they're going to have

3386.079 --> 3389.039
this this

3392.68 --> 3399.0
past like this past that people are not

3396.28 --> 3399.0
really going to

3401.359 --> 3406.319
forget that's where the karian

3403.92 --> 3413.079
tricksters came

3406.319 --> 3413.079
from okay are you sure they came from

3415.24 --> 3418.24
Turkey

3419.48 --> 3423.119
I thought they were from Ukraine

3427.559 --> 3431.2000000000003
originally let me look that

3445.16 --> 3448.16
up

3454.28 --> 3458.7200000000003
oh no they are nomadic turkey

3458.839 --> 3467.96
Turkish ah but they were also in

3463.119 --> 3467.96
Ukraine Southern Ukraine Crimea

3469.359 --> 3473.839
Kazakhstan okay so yeah it wasn't that

3471.599 --> 3473.839
far

3474.839 --> 3478.119
off hm

3484.05 --> 3487.389
[Music]

3505.119 --> 3508.119
interesting

3512.039 --> 3518.76
well Bill not design tonight maybe in

3513.88 --> 3522.48
that sense this Israel is basically a a

3518.76 --> 3526.3590000000004
new Outpost of the Kazarian

3522.48 --> 3526.359
Empire that's moving

3527.64 --> 3533.799
Southward you could think of it like

3531.28 --> 3536.599
that

3533.799 --> 3540.0389999999998
potentially I'm sure that they will

3536.599 --> 3540.039
disagree to that

3548.17 --> 3553.92
[Music]

3550.92 --> 3553.92
Etc

3565.039 --> 3568.92
right

3567.88 --> 3573.079
all right

3568.92 --> 3575.359
anyway hope everybody is informed and

3573.079 --> 3578.799
entertained maybe it's not so

3575.359 --> 3580.88
entertaining but it is important to

3578.799 --> 3583.64
address this type of thing every now and

3580.88 --> 3586.039
then I'm not going to make a habit I

3583.64 --> 3589.68
mean this is definitely not the like oh

3586.039 --> 3589.6800000000003
complain about the world

3593.079 --> 3597.76
channel but when it's time to do that

3595.599 --> 3599.119
sort of thing it's time to do that sort

3597.76 --> 3601.76
of

3599.119 --> 3604.92
thing it's necessary to keep things

3601.76 --> 3608.599
flowing if I just avoid it I just kind

3604.92 --> 3608.599
of freeze up i' freeze

3612.319 --> 3615.7599999999998
up and I think that would make my

3614.559 --> 3618.6800000000003
Channel

3615.76 --> 3623.2400000000002
boring and people would start to feel

3618.68 --> 3623.24
like I'd be purposely avoiding sub

3624.16 --> 3628.48
subjects so this is the way I'm going to

3627.28 --> 3632.0
do it it's

3628.48 --> 3633.96
just stuff from the negative side of

3632.0 --> 3636.72
things of the world are just going to

3633.96 --> 3640.16
like gradually Heap up

3636.72 --> 3640.16
until there's

3640.28 --> 3647.599
enough for it to

3643.68 --> 3650.5589999999997
basically burn burn it off and today is

3647.599 --> 3654.92
one of those shows where we burn that

3650.559 --> 3657.92
stuff off we address it we deal with

3654.92 --> 3657.92
it

3658.559 --> 3663.119
and then

3660.839 --> 3665.4
hopefully after that's done we can all

3663.119 --> 3665.4
move

3665.52 --> 3670.7599999999998
on all right I'm going to make another

3668.16 --> 3672.5989999999997
coffee and see how that works out maybe

3670.76 --> 3673.3590000000004
I'm going to get all bouncy from it I

3672.599 --> 3676.88
don't

3673.359 --> 3676.88
know be

3684.92 --> 3687.92
that

3714.839 --> 3717.839
e

3744.839 --> 3747.839
e

3774.839 --> 3777.839
e

3804.76 --> 3807.76

3834.72 --> 3837.72

3962.72 --> 3966.1189999999997
overused at this

3984.559 --> 3987.559
point

3990.799 --> 3995.7599999999998
I really don't know what my computer is

3992.68 --> 3995.7599999999998
getting so excited

4002.119 --> 4007.76
about I might need

4004.319 --> 4011.2
to dtif

4007.76 --> 4014.5200000000004

4185.08 --> 4190.799
the farthest extent of retaliation that

4187.839 --> 4190.799
we could possibly

4194.32 --> 4197.32
imagine

4199.52 --> 4204.8
think that's stopping the

4201.92 --> 4206.4800000000005
hate think it's going to stop the

4204.8 --> 4210.52
hater

4206.48 --> 4214.32
to point at

4210.52 --> 4217.4800000000005
them so that you could retaliate to the

4214.32 --> 4221.759999999999
farthest extent of your

4217.48 --> 4221.759999999999
imagination think that that stops the

4224.32 --> 4228.5599999999995
hate

4225.88 --> 4231.08
the military AED men that have been

4228.56 --> 4234.1990000000005

attack

4262.0 --> 4270.44
yes yes the attack that initially killed

4266.8 --> 4273.04
less Israeli citizens than the IDF has

4270.44 --> 4276.719
effectively killed

4273.04 --> 4280.12
since the retaliation to the

4276.719 --> 4280.12
attack yes

4284.239 --> 4287.239
Fester

4292.92 --> 4299.88

4295.88 --> 4299.88
trigger point the nonsense

4301.719 --> 4308.08
excuse yeah the nonsense excuse the

4305.04 --> 4312.8
standown of the Iron Dome I need to be

4308.08 --> 4315.88
reminded about that about the like

4312.8 --> 4319.56
egregious provable stand

4315.88 --> 4323.0
down and the warnings like even the

4319.56 --> 4325.4400000000005
Egyptian government gave Israel that

4323.0 --> 4328.719
something was going to happen

4325.44 --> 4328.719
yeah yeah

4330.12 --> 4336.84
obviously yeah it's obvious to all that

4333.48 --> 4342.44
there will be retaliation that got more

4336.84 --> 4342.4400000000005
Israeli citizens killed than the initial

4344.159 --> 4347.159
attack

4347.52 --> 4356.0
way more yeah and international Aid

4352.92 --> 4359.0
workers yeah got any more brilliant

4356.0 --> 4359.0
rebuttal

4374.12 --> 4377.12
[Â __Â ]

4379.76 --> 4386.320000000001
oh oh by the way did I forget like the

4382.36 --> 4391.759999999999
tens of thousands of children that were

4386.32 --> 4391.759999999999
blown up oh did I forget about that

4392.239 --> 4399.48
part oh but those were of course of the

4395.8 --> 4401.2390000000005
opponent right so those don't count now

4399.48 --> 4404.44
that I specifically left them out

4401.239 --> 4405.759999999999
because just the amount of Israeli

4404.44 --> 4408.159
citizens

4405.76 --> 4412.679
that were killed in the

4408.159 --> 4415.879999999999
retaliation by far outnumber the initial

4412.679 --> 4419.4800000000005
deaths caused by the supposed attack

4415.88 --> 4419.4800000000005

4459.76 --> 4467.04

4464.4 --> 4467.04
record

4468.8 --> 4477.8
[Â __Â ] yeah blowing up hostages on

4473.92 --> 4481.8
record like not even by accident just

4477.8 --> 4483.4800000000005

4483.48 --> 4487.32
idiot got any more

4490.96 --> 4497.04
excuses I keep being so obnoxious I'm so

4494.159 --> 4500.239
obnoxious what pointing out the [Â __Â ]

4497.04 --> 4502.639
brutal reality of the entire

4500.239 --> 4506.5599999999995
scenario that you keep trying to make

4502.639 --> 4506.56

idiotic but I'm not even going to go for

4535.239 --> 4540.678999999999
like oh they wanted it or oh they didn't

4538.199 --> 4543.799999999999

have been killed has been chosen to be

4547.08 --> 4553.92
blown

4549.48 --> 4555.5199999999995
up since the retaliation of the attack

4553.92 --> 4558.36
initiated

4555.52 --> 4560.88
and then notice how the amount of

4558.36 --> 4566.759999999999
purposefully chosen to be blown up

4560.88 --> 4570.08
Israeli citizen like by far like insane

4566.76 --> 4573.04
multiplication outnumber the amount of

4570.08 --> 4578.03
initial deaths of Israeli citizens in

4573.04 --> 4580.5199999999995
the supposed original attack okay I'm

5222.199 --> 5228.119
now what and it says it's going to be

5225.8 --> 5232.52
raining all of a sudden I thought it was

5228.119 --> 5238.679
going to be sunny make up your mind

5232.52 --> 5238.679
weather 42% humidity oh that's that's

5241.52 --> 5247.679
risen maybe it's going to be a weird

5244.56 --> 5247.679
storm day

5247.719 --> 5251.08
later we'll

5253.44 --> 5260.199
see PJ C what no PJ CNET is not PJ

5261.119 --> 5265.4
kushank definitely not the same

5272.159 --> 5278.719
guy I don't like P gank wouldn't like

5276.239 --> 5281.959999999999
show up here

5278.719 --> 5285.44
anyway it's just he's kind of a flatso

5281.96 --> 5289.04
stoe right now it's been for a while I

5285.44 --> 5291.36
mean he did used to show up like three

5289.04 --> 5291.36
years

5292.52 --> 5302.119000000001
ago but pjc Net's been around for for

5297.92 --> 5302.119
years it's really in the

5302.92 --> 5308.28
last half half a year year that it kind

5306.36 --> 5310.159
of stopped showing up but I mean a lot

5308.28 --> 5313.32
of people have stopped showing up maybe

5310.159 --> 5313.32
it's because I get less

5314.8 --> 5318.6
Rowdy I don't know what it

5325.36 --> 5331.639
is what what are you talking about Gary

5328.84 --> 5336.04
F he has an

5331.639 --> 5336.04
opinion what

5343.72 --> 5346.879
[Music]

5349.56 --> 5355.159000000001
17 Celsius in Birmingham that's not

5352.719 --> 5355.159
really

5363.04 --> 5370.639
hot I mean it's been that

5366.88 --> 5373.679
temperature for weeks here already I

5370.639 --> 5376.76
mean it hasn't been 24Â° C which is what

5373.679 --> 5381.2390000000005
it is right now like that's actually

5376.76 --> 5381.2390000000005
warm that's kind of Summer

5393.04 --> 5396.04
temperature

5410.56 --> 5413.689
[Music]

5422.96 --> 5425.96
for

5429.679 --> 5436.0
in cry says 19 C this

5439.4 --> 5444.839999999999
okay that's the difference what are you

5442.44 --> 5444.839999999999
talking

5448.52 --> 5454.6
about oh yes blunder 23 no I haven't

5452.56 --> 5460.76
been on flatter debate much I haven't

5454.6 --> 5460.76
been on Flat Earth debate at all for two

5463.28 --> 5468.08
months and I'm not going to be on Flat

5465.8 --> 5468.08
Earth

5482.92 --> 5485.92
debate

5486.92 --> 5492.76
I've gone my own

5490.0 --> 5495.679
way it's something I probably needed to

5492.76 --> 5499.719
do for a long

5495.679 --> 5503.52
time cuz I was just

5499.719 --> 5503.52
not I wasn't being

5505.36 --> 5511.239
heard like and people were telling me

5508.4 --> 5512.839999999999
were pointing it out to me and I kept

5511.239 --> 5514.839999999999
trying to

5512.84 --> 5518.2390000000005
defend

5514.84 --> 5521.52
fed and the guys and how they

5518.239 --> 5524.159
behaved to try to keep fitting in and I

5521.52 --> 5527.159000000001
just didn't they didn't give me the room

5524.159 --> 5530.759999999999
they didn't give me the respect that I

5527.159 --> 5530.759999999999
needed to carry

5533.56 --> 5540.159000000001
on and then in the end they even

5537.159 --> 5543.4
demanded that I laid down the unique

5540.159 --> 5544.719
traits and things that I did that

5543.4 --> 5546.199
contribut

5544.719 --> 5550.2390000000005
to the

5546.199 --> 5552.839999999999
show to I don't know in some crazy ill

5550.239 --> 5555.919999999999
thought out effort to make me just a

5552.84 --> 5559.08
pawn in the background and I'm not going

5555.92 --> 5561.119
to be that at all and that's when I

5559.08 --> 5565.36
decided to

5561.119 --> 5565.36
split and just be my own

5572.84 --> 5575.84
show

5578.239 --> 5584.44
imagine being booted no I wasn't booted

5580.96 --> 5589.119
you [Â __Â ] [Â __Â ] I

5584.44 --> 5592.5599999999995
left they literally begged me to come

5589.119 --> 5596.639
back well not

5592.56 --> 5599.04
Nathan and I like no I'm not going to

5596.639 --> 5599.04
come

5602.76 --> 5605.76
back

5606.84 --> 5613.0
yeah I'm not going to fall in line with

5609.679 --> 5615.4
that crap I'm not going to reduce myself

5613.0 --> 5620.239
just to try to fit in and I'm not going

5615.4 --> 5624.28
to subject myself to the daily dose of

5620.239 --> 5627.879999999999
negativity that is part of it and hey

5624.28 --> 5627.88
sometimes it's kind of

5628.159 --> 5632.719
entertaining but a lot of the times it's

5630.719 --> 5637.08
literally a waste of my

5632.719 --> 5638.2390000000005
time and in the last few years like half

5637.08 --> 5641.76
the

5638.239 --> 5644.718999999999
time I would join fed I would like even

5641.76 --> 5647.159000000001
go out and just do groceries not even

5644.719 --> 5647.159
being

5656.88 --> 5661.56
there branding got in way

5662.719 --> 5665.719
what

5667.44 --> 5674.36
you don't believe oceans are still no

5669.84 --> 5676.08
I'm not a balard blunder I'm not I'm not

5674.36 --> 5679.239
ridiculously

5676.08 --> 5682.119
[Â __Â ] that leaving fed doesn't mean

5679.239 --> 5687.28
you certainly go back to the ball yeah

5682.119 --> 5690.5199999999995
yeah despite popular Ballard belief yeah

5687.28 --> 5693.44
fed isn't actually a mind controlled

5690.52 --> 5696.320000000001
cult that forces people to believe the

5693.44 --> 5700.04
Earth is flat no we just figured out

5696.32 --> 5703.44
that it is flat and how it is flat and

5700.04 --> 5706.639
when you leave fed the Earth is still

5703.44 --> 5708.36
flat and the second law thermodynamics

5706.639 --> 5711.84
still

5708.36 --> 5715.239
stands yeah and the Black Swan argument

5711.84 --> 5715.2390000000005
is still the Black Swan

5716.239 --> 5722.839999999999
argument that's

5718.96 --> 5724.639
permanent doesn't go away yeah you don't

5722.84 --> 5727.6
have to be in

5724.639 --> 5730.04
indoctrinated to make that work it works

5727.6 --> 5730.04
it just

5730.6 --> 5737.8
works what just doesn't work for me is

5733.56 --> 5740.159000000001
to have to have my attention on that and

5737.8 --> 5743.84
the confrontation with tenacious

5740.159 --> 5745.679
ballards all the time every day like

5743.84 --> 5747.119000000001
that's the part that was like really

5745.679 --> 5751.159
wearing on

5747.119 --> 5751.159
me and I couldn't do it

5751.6 --> 5756.2390000000005
anymore I didn't want to do it

5760.719 --> 5765.8
anymore I wanted to move on to other

5763.119 --> 5768.719
thing to more esoteric things to more

5765.8 --> 5771.4800000000005
Spirit mechanics related things to the

5768.719 --> 5776.6
mysteries of the past and the

5771.48 --> 5780.5599999999995
Giants and the alternative history and

5776.6 --> 5780.56
Magic Rudolph Steiner's

5780.92 --> 5786.679
Legacy all of that that's what I wanted

5783.28 --> 5789.639
to get into into more of my kind of

5786.679 --> 5790.88
niche conceptions of how the realm

5789.639 --> 5793.56
actually

5790.88 --> 5795.719
functions besides just like oh we

5793.56 --> 5797.4800000000005
definitely know it's not a ball yeah

5795.719 --> 5800.2390000000005
that's really cute but I actually want

5797.48 --> 5802.5199999999995
to figure out what the hell it is that

5800.239 --> 5807.0
I'm looking

5802.52 --> 5810.400000000001
at I want to have a conception for what

5807.0 --> 5814.4
I think is going on I want to have an

5810.4 --> 5818.04
idea about what could be out there

5814.4 --> 5820.199
potentially like how could it be out

5818.04 --> 5822.04
there right and all these things were

5820.199 --> 5824.5199999999995
just getting cut off and I didn't get

5822.04 --> 5827.239
any respect for

5824.52 --> 5830.4400000000005
them

5827.239 --> 5832.879999999999
so I'll just carry on with all that and

5830.44 --> 5835.239
it's a whole range of things there a

5832.88 --> 5839.28
whole range of subjects that are mine

5835.239 --> 5841.119
they're all mine yeah you reject them or

5839.28 --> 5844.159
can't talk about it on your platform

5841.119 --> 5847.08
well guess what they're mine now

5844.159 --> 5850.119
I talk about him and I love talking

5847.08 --> 5852.0
about him whenever their time arrives

5850.119 --> 5854.92
because you can't always talk about all

5852.0 --> 5854.92
these things all the

5855.8 --> 5860.76
time you have to be properly

5867.199 --> 5872.44
inspired maybe if you ventured outside

5870.04 --> 5875.44
sometime oh really outside of

5872.44 --> 5875.44
what

5878.0 --> 5883.119
what you think that if I'm going to be

5879.48 --> 5885.4
traveling around in the world that

5883.119 --> 5888.759999999999
that's going to give me the answers as

5885.4 --> 5893.32
to what is beyond Antarctica or the the

5888.76 --> 5895.2390000000005
North Pole region or if the celestials

5893.32 --> 5899.119
where they

5895.239 --> 5901.839999999999
are where the where the glass

5899.119 --> 5903.598999999999
firmament projector structure for the

5901.84 --> 5906.159000000001
non-local holographic angular

5903.599 --> 5908.32
manifestations is all those things

5906.159 --> 5910.48
really I just have to move around a lot

5908.32 --> 5913.32
and then I'll find answers or I

5910.48 --> 5916.598999999999
completely want because physically

5913.32 --> 5920.4
moving around doesn't really help you

5916.599 --> 5922.04
advance knowledge about that at all

5920.4 --> 5926.638999999999
double

5922.04 --> 5930.96
yeah I figured all these things out

5926.639 --> 5934.28
sitting right here in this stupid little

5930.96 --> 5938.32
room for a decade

5934.28 --> 5941.759999999999
yeah I didn't need to go anywhere to

5938.32 --> 5945.5599999999995
figure that out can't you see it can't

5941.76 --> 5948.52
you see that you don't have to go

5945.56 --> 5952.04
anywhere to figure things

5948.52 --> 5955.2390000000005
out you just have to figure things out

5952.04 --> 5957.599
and stop letting the world distract you

5955.239 --> 5961.799999999999
and that's what I've done you don't need

5957.599 --> 5961.8
to go anywhere to figure out these

5962.36 --> 5968.03
things

5964.98 --> 5968.03
[Music]

5984.8 --> 5990.4400000000005
trust me they're using a sex and run if

5987.8 --> 5992.320000000001
they need a flat Baseline what the [Â __Â ]

5990.44 --> 5995.32
does that mean Gary

5992.32 --> 5995.32
f

6014.76 --> 6020.119000000001
what yeah well

6017.199 --> 6022.96
plunder the Realms outside you wonder

6020.119 --> 6025.32
about p dis on the inside yeah you know

6022.96 --> 6025.32
what

6025.88 --> 6032.84
logic dictates there has to be a

6028.8 --> 6036.08
physical limit to all physical things

6032.84 --> 6039.679
including the volume of the realm but

6036.08 --> 6043.159
you know where you can find Infinity

6039.679 --> 6046.639
inward yeah that's what all the wise

6043.159 --> 6048.719
masters of history have told us yeah

6046.639 --> 6051.76
it's exactly what I'm doing that's why

6048.719 --> 6055.4
I'm sitting in this stupid little room

6051.76 --> 6060.0
figuring all these things out because

6055.4 --> 6062.598999999999
I'm looking inward yeah that oh I need

6060.0 --> 6064.48
to get out because I'm not accomplishing

6062.599 --> 6065.76
thing what because you're Hollow you're

6064.48 --> 6068.32
Hollow and

6065.76 --> 6070.400000000001
empty and you kept yourself Hollow and

6068.32 --> 6072.96
empty you don't have anything on the

6070.4 --> 6075.32
inside so there's nothing to

6072.96 --> 6077.44
explore oh well I don't have that

6075.32 --> 6079.599
problem I have a lot to explore on the

6077.44 --> 6082.32
inside and I figured all these things

6079.599 --> 6084.8
out sitting in this stupid little room

6082.32 --> 6087.28
while you guys keep regurgitating the

6084.8 --> 6088.679
same hor [Â __Â ] over and over again not

6087.28 --> 6092.119
accomplishing

6088.679 --> 6094.52
anything scrambling for your Earthly

6092.119 --> 6097.119
bubles thinking that you're better than

6094.52 --> 6099.360000000001
other people that don't have your amount

6097.119 --> 6099.36
of

6099.8 --> 6107.28
bubles

6102.639 --> 6110.04
yeah ashes to ashes dust to dust yeah

6107.28 --> 6110.04
Spirit to

6110.44 --> 6115.36
God yeah I know where my inest

6113.199 --> 6117.44
investment

6115.36 --> 6121.679
lies

6117.44 --> 6125.799999999999
yeah inward Spirit to

6121.679 --> 6125.8
God I don't need no

6133.72 --> 6136.89
[Music]

6142.159 --> 6145.159
dust

6158.76 --> 6163.280000000001
all this coffee is kind of riling me

6172.119 --> 6175.119
up

6178.56 --> 6183.360000000001
mail

6180.36 --> 6183.36
servers

6186.88 --> 6192.599
yep oh plunder 23 that's why am I that's

6190.36 --> 6195.48
why I'm here isn't

6192.599 --> 6198.360000000001
it right while all these other idiots

6195.48 --> 6201.239
out there they insist Arn get a job what

6198.36 --> 6204.839999999999
so I can sit on my ass all day long and

6201.239 --> 6206.839999999999
checking like what your describing male

6204.84 --> 6210.08
servers and

6206.84 --> 6214.04
certificates boring my ass

6210.08 --> 6217.36
off or I could just not do that kind of

6214.04 --> 6220.639
stupid [Â __Â ] not saying that it is really

6217.36 --> 6221.839999999999
stupid it's just stupid in comparison to

6220.639 --> 6226.28
what I

6221.84 --> 6226.28
do in my opinion from my

6227.239 --> 6233.32
perspective I have all this

6230.0 --> 6236.8
room I have all this room this this

6233.32 --> 6240.719
entire shitty little room is all

6236.8 --> 6243.159000000001
mine and I can just go Inward and find

6240.719 --> 6245.159
all kinds of insights find all kinds of

6243.159 --> 6248.04
honesty that I don't have to be afraid

6245.159 --> 6250.04
to express because I'm not going to lose

6248.04 --> 6253.92
my job over

6250.04 --> 6257.4
it I'm not going to rub my boss the

6253.92 --> 6260.56
wrong way I'm not going to lose my

6257.4 --> 6265.04
investment on the bank because I said

6260.56 --> 6265.04
the wrong thing I have this

6265.8 --> 6270.159000000001
Freedom

6267.32 --> 6273.44
yeah Carrie gets paid for his efforts

6270.159 --> 6275.719
well to a degree so do I I don't need

6273.44 --> 6277.799999999999
that much

6275.719 --> 6281.679
anyway

6277.8 --> 6281.679
oh yeah yeah

6292.04 --> 6295.32
that

6293.8 --> 6297.320000000001
people are needed on the ground to keep

6295.32 --> 6298.28
the machines in order that's right I

6297.32 --> 6300.44
know

6298.28 --> 6303.36
plunder right I'm not telling you your

6300.44 --> 6305.4
job is useless I'm just telling

6303.36 --> 6307.679
you you're

6305.4 --> 6312.638999999999
bored I'm

6307.679 --> 6314.4
here for people I'm here so that you you

6312.639 --> 6317.599
don't have to be

6314.4 --> 6320.96
bored I'm here to provide ideas and

6317.599 --> 6325.76
Views and insights that you wouldn't

6320.96 --> 6325.76
find just sitting there doing that

6333.199 --> 6336.199
job

6338.0 --> 6345.239
yeah you provide a service by

6341.84 --> 6347.56
maintaining the communication system I

6345.239 --> 6350.959999999999
provide a service

6347.56 --> 6351.92
by providing communication that makes it

6350.96 --> 6354.92
worth

6351.92 --> 6354.92
it

6358.76 --> 6369.08
yeah in that sense you're working for

6364.28 --> 6372.119
me you're building it so that I can give

6369.08 --> 6372.119
meaning to

6373.52 --> 6380.4400000000005
it oh above begging no no begging is

6377.8 --> 6384.04
just a side effect yeah

6380.44 --> 6386.28
that's the begging

6384.04 --> 6389.719
is just for the

6386.28 --> 6393.759999999999
extra because it's not about making

6389.719 --> 6397.119
money to me it's about making

6393.76 --> 6399.4400000000005
value and if I have to live a life in

6397.119 --> 6403.44
which I beg to get

6399.44 --> 6408.0
around well then it's still worth it for

6403.44 --> 6410.799999999999
me yeah it's still worth it I'm okay

6408.0 --> 6413.08
with that I'm okay to beg for money if

6410.8 --> 6416.4400000000005
that means that I have the the

6413.08 --> 6420.92
opportunity to actually provide

6416.44 --> 6420.919999999999
precious rare

6423.159 --> 6426.679
value it's worth

6437.119 --> 6441.839999999999
it

6439.52 --> 6443.719
yeah so by all

6441.84 --> 6447.639
means

6443.719 --> 6447.639
support me through the PayPal and the

6448.36 --> 6453.199
patreon cuz I could really use the

6451.119 --> 6457.119
support I've been running a little bit

6453.199 --> 6461.5599999999995
low especially with the recent

6457.119 --> 6461.5599999999995
expenditures on a new bicycle that I

6467.76 --> 6474.84
needed I assure you it's all going to be

6471.28 --> 6474.84
spent on food

6477.28 --> 6481.44
I dramatically cut down on the amount of

6480.119 --> 6484.159
cannabis

6481.44 --> 6486.759999999999
consumption and I mean dramatically it's

6484.159 --> 6490.5599999999995
now currently at

6486.76 --> 6493.52
oneth of what it used to be and it's not

6490.56 --> 6497.400000000001
really going to go much further past

6493.52 --> 6500.280000000001
that cuz it's just the chemistry just

6497.4 --> 6503.119
changed I respond differently to it now

6500.28 --> 6504.48
like I can't even handle the amounts

6503.119 --> 6507.639
that I used to

6504.48 --> 6510.5199999999995
smoke like I I can't physically handle

6507.639 --> 6513.679
that I think that I I used to do that

6510.52 --> 6517.1990000000005
partially to to numb

6513.679 --> 6519.36
myself from dealing with the

6517.199 --> 6523.0
dissatisfaction and the friction that I

6519.36 --> 6525.32
was dealing with surrounding fed not

6523.0 --> 6528.28
saying that they made me smoke but I

6525.32 --> 6531.599
mean I did kind of use it as

6528.28 --> 6533.679
medication to help me deal with that and

6531.599 --> 6537.28
since I quit

6533.679 --> 6537.28
like it everything

6539.4 --> 6545.32
changed and I dream more indeed Bill n

6542.599 --> 6547.719
the science den and hey it's saving me a

6545.32 --> 6550.639
lot of cost like it literally changed

6547.719 --> 6553.04
the cost picture for me in a month like

6550.639 --> 6553.04
pretty

6555.639 --> 6561.119
dramatically the anxiety that pops up

6558.56 --> 6563.96
yeah well that's that's two different

6561.119 --> 6566.598999999999
ways to deal with it I mean cannabis

6563.96 --> 6570.44
acutely can create anxiety but then

6566.599 --> 6575.4800000000005
after like 10 to 15 minutes that anxiety

6570.44 --> 6578.678999999999
boost kind of goes away and leaves

6575.48 --> 6583.199
relaxation right but I mean if you're

6578.679 --> 6585.52
like in a weird Panic spiral phase

6583.199 --> 6587.598999999999
psychologically then it just creates

6585.52 --> 6588.92
anxiety and that's what happened like

6587.599 --> 6591.719
halfway of

6588.92 --> 6593.28
February I had that for a month to the

6591.719 --> 6596.96
point where I L

6593.28 --> 6600.199
hallucinated again started hallucinating

6596.96 --> 6605.119
started remembering the really really

6600.199 --> 6605.119
dark parts of my Dark World Visions like

6605.36 --> 6612.0
Terrors paranoid Terrors of people like

6608.719 --> 6615.119
coming to kill me and [Â __Â ] which never

6612.0 --> 6616.52
happened and never will happen but it

6615.119 --> 6619.679
was very

6616.52 --> 6622.8
real those Visions are like more real

6619.679 --> 6625.84
than real things and so they really

6622.8 --> 6629.76
impose themselves on you and quitting

6625.84 --> 6632.92
smoking cannabis kind of made those

6629.76 --> 6632.92
Terrors go away

6635.239 --> 6640.919999999999
again right but it's technically all

6638.44 --> 6643.638999999999
just compounded

6640.92 --> 6648.079
stress that brought me to that

6643.639 --> 6651.639
position and quitting fed and like

6648.079 --> 6654.92
really deciding that because I wasn't

6651.639 --> 6657.88
really being allowed to even decide that

6654.92 --> 6659.84
by the guys okay they were not accepting

6657.88 --> 6663.36
my

6659.84 --> 6668.079
resignation do you do you understand

6663.36 --> 6668.079
they were not accepting my

6677.28 --> 6683.84
resignation okay that's really

6680.8 --> 6685.4400000000005
freaky especially when it just starts to

6683.84 --> 6688.4800000000005
get to the point where you start to

6685.44 --> 6691.119
hallucinate nightmarish

6688.48 --> 6693.799999999999
things it's really weird that you find

6691.119 --> 6695.48
out that you're not being let go I had

6693.8 --> 6699.76
to really

6695.48 --> 6703.48
like be very upfront about it eventually

6699.76 --> 6707.280000000001
but I didn't want to cause some kind of

6703.48 --> 6709.598999999999
like relationship breakup fight [Â __Â ]

6707.28 --> 6713.04
there's no [Â __Â ] way I ever want that

6709.599 --> 6717.04
to happen it would be a monument

6713.04 --> 6717.04
waste of energies on both

6720.4 --> 6724.839999999999
sides I never want to get in a fight

6723.119 --> 6727.92
with these guys I mean I've been too

6724.84 --> 6731.599
close with them in many ways and and I'm

6727.92 --> 6735.52
not like blaming them it just didn't

6731.599 --> 6738.04
work it's like at some like some people

6735.52 --> 6740.0
may have experienced you you yeah you

6738.04 --> 6741.5199999999995
get in a relationship you fall in love

6740.0 --> 6743.8
with

6741.52 --> 6746.159000000001
somebody

6743.8 --> 6748.119000000001
and then after a while it's just like

6746.159 --> 6751.598999999999
suddenly it turns out that the chemistry

6748.119 --> 6754.239
is not working for either you or your

6751.599 --> 6756.8
partner like it just turns out not to be

6754.239 --> 6757.919999999999
working and then it has to quit or it

6756.8 --> 6761.599
turns

6757.92 --> 6764.32
sour and you start to get into like it

6761.599 --> 6766.599
gets polluted with like fight with

6764.32 --> 6771.44
arguing Behavior

6766.599 --> 6773.2390000000005
Etc well that happened on my

6771.44 --> 6776.36
side

6773.239 --> 6777.5599999999995
it got polluted like I couldn't handle

6776.36 --> 6780.04
it

6777.56 --> 6783.2390000000005
anymore I couldn't

6780.04 --> 6788.32
handle the group Spirit the group Spirit

6783.239 --> 6792.32
was a huge huge strain on my spirit in

6788.32 --> 6794.5599999999995
my being like painful strain and they

6792.32 --> 6796.199
were all like ah come on you just have

6794.56 --> 6798.4800000000005
to deal with it it's just the way we are

6796.199 --> 6801.879999999999
and I'm like yeah and I can't handle

6798.48 --> 6805.718999999999
that way I can't physically handle I'm

6801.88 --> 6809.079
suffering physically from it it needs to

6805.719 --> 6812.719
stop they couldn't make it stop so the

6809.079 --> 6812.719
only way to stop it was to

6817.079 --> 6823.799999999999
leave and when I did everything changed

6820.96 --> 6825.36
everything changed like my the way I

6823.8 --> 6828.360000000001
work

6825.36 --> 6830.88
changed the way I felt the way I slept

6828.36 --> 6830.88
the way I

6831.119 --> 6839.679
thought I had this this calmness of mind

6835.92 --> 6844.52
and peace coming over me that I haven't

6839.679 --> 6847.4400000000005
experienced in a long time maybe ever a

6844.52 --> 6850.159000000001
a level of clarity came to me that I had

6847.44 --> 6853.079
never experienced before I felt like a

6850.159 --> 6856.28
completely new person for a while like

6853.079 --> 6859.199
when I right came right out of the fear

6856.28 --> 6861.079
spiraling when that stopped I literally

6859.199 --> 6864.32
felt like a new person but I've deal

6861.079 --> 6869.119
been dealing with other things too like

6864.32 --> 6871.199
this new way of spiritually operating

6869.119 --> 6874.88
this new way I'm functioning has brought

6871.199 --> 6878.199
its new problems

6874.88 --> 6878.92
like I have weird sleeping issues all of

6878.199 --> 6884.4
a

6878.92 --> 6887.2390000000005
sudden which I have never ever had since

6884.4 --> 6890.4
I was like a teen I've never had that I

6887.239 --> 6893.678999999999
haven't had that in 10 years no sleeping

6890.4 --> 6898.199
issues whatsoever like all I would just

6893.679 --> 6901.52
go in bed and I'd get to sleep quick now

6898.199 --> 6905.96
I have weird ttis

6901.52 --> 6907.96
issues and I've always had some kind of

6905.96 --> 6909.96
apparent sound that's not actually

6907.96 --> 6911.8
audible sound that's kind of happening

6909.96 --> 6914.84
in my

6911.8 --> 6916.92
head but now it it's really getting in

6914.84 --> 6920.52
the way all of a sudden so it's like a

6916.92 --> 6922.599
new balance in internal and spiritual

6920.52 --> 6926.400000000001
chemistry and I'm getting used to it it

6922.599 --> 6926.400000000001
it's like I've just completely

6927.48 --> 6931.919999999999
changed and I have to learn to deal with

6929.92 --> 6934.1990000000005
it and

6931.92 --> 6938.159
find ways

6934.199 --> 6938.159
to remedy the new

6939.639 --> 6945.1990000000005
issues you've become sensitive to

6942.36 --> 6948.44
infrasound

6945.199 --> 6951.239
okay I do seem to have become a little

6948.44 --> 6954.239

all right anyway let's get back to

7210.199 --> 7217.32
uh bill nine was saying start

7213.44 --> 7217.32
remembering Dreams yeah after first I

7218.32 --> 7223.199
stopped cannabis especially because I

7221.119 --> 7225.92
completely quit for like a month during

7223.199 --> 7228.5599999999995
the Panic period which is really great

7225.92 --> 7233.28
but man did I have a lot of Dreams

7228.56 --> 7235.119000000001
including like dreams that I had like

7233.28 --> 7237.599
when I was

7235.119 --> 7242.96
eight and I just

7237.599 --> 7242.96
completely relived that dream is

7243.119 --> 7247.598999999999
amazing a month cold turkey

7248.88 --> 7255.159000000001
yeah well not 100% cold turkey I like

7252.52 --> 7257.079000000001
tried it three times just to see what it

7255.159 --> 7260.5599999999995
would do and then it like immediately

7257.079 --> 7263.119
was ah I would regret it like ah that

7260.56 --> 7264.8
was bad now I have to like be paranoid

7263.119 --> 7267.48
for an hour

7264.8 --> 7269.320000000001
again right I I tried it out a couple of

7267.48 --> 7272.638999999999
times and it

7269.32 --> 7275.5199999999995
sucked but other than those tries yeah I

7272.639 --> 7277.84
went cold turkey and it was fine I mean

7275.52 --> 7280.92
it was better I felt better I did just

7277.84 --> 7283.84
kind of smoke tobacco a

7280.92 --> 7285.8
lot

7283.84 --> 7288.0
and it was good it was good that I was

7285.8 --> 7290.679
just off it

7288.0 --> 7292.48
completely and then eventually like the

7290.679 --> 7296.079
Panic phase

7292.48 --> 7298.4
stopped and I gradually started back up

7296.079 --> 7303.44
again but now I'm like I'm only smoking

7298.4 --> 7307.48
hashes and I'm smoking like tiny bits of

7303.44 --> 7310.32
it so like when I roll one joint of that

7307.48 --> 7313.839999999999
and I do that like two maximum three

7310.32 --> 7318.4
times in a day and after the sun goes

7313.84 --> 7322.400000000001
down the amount that I put in there is

7318.4 --> 7325.598999999999
like a quarter at Best of what I would

7322.4 --> 7331.04
originally put into one of

7325.599 --> 7334.4800000000005
those and I'd smoke like 8 to 10 a day

7331.04 --> 7336.32
now I smoke three at maximum I mean you

7334.48 --> 7340.839999999999
can just

7336.32 --> 7343.599
count the amount of money I'm

7340.84 --> 7347.76
saving by

7343.599 --> 7347.76
just smoking so much

7355.76 --> 7361.8
less stopping weed can trigger a long

7358.76 --> 7364.8
period of hallucination confusion and

7361.8 --> 7367.96
vision uh okay woodw and gny bear but

7364.8 --> 7370.84
for me it worked exactly the opposite I

7367.96 --> 7373.04
was having

7370.84 --> 7375.28
hallucinations

7373.04 --> 7379.239
During the period when I was smoking a

7375.28 --> 7382.119
lot and I didn't even realize it yeah

7379.239 --> 7385.759999999999
those soltion would literally like

7382.119 --> 7389.04
impose themselves in between normal

7385.76 --> 7391.92
reality and then afterward I had to be

7389.04 --> 7394.36
confused about like wait did that really

7391.92 --> 7398.04
happen or

7394.36 --> 7400.88
not it would be waking

7398.04 --> 7402.36
hallucinations and that like because of

7400.88 --> 7404.52
pressure

7402.36 --> 7408.4
it's like pressure based

7404.52 --> 7410.040000000001
things but since I quit I didn't have

7408.4 --> 7412.48
them

7410.04 --> 7414.92
anymore like hallucinations for me

7412.48 --> 7418.5199999999995
always do kind of relate to my pineal

7414.92 --> 7423.04
gland activity and cannabis does tend to

7418.52 --> 7425.559
awaken that my pineal gland and so if I

7423.04 --> 7427.28
then while it's awakened get under

7425.559 --> 7429.88
extreme pressure

7427.28 --> 7433.719
especially social peer pressure based

7429.88 --> 7433.719
type pressure that is UN

7433.84 --> 7442.32
then hallucination can just suddenly

7436.679 --> 7442.32
happen in between normal scenarios it's

7447.76 --> 7454.8
freaky in the past I even like was crazy

7451.48 --> 7457.119
enough to actively experiment with it by

7454.8 --> 7460.4400000000005
allowing myself to get in positions

7457.119 --> 7462.839999999999
where I would be abnormally

7460.44 --> 7466.119
pressured and

7462.84 --> 7466.119000000001
just to see what would

7467.84 --> 7473.28
happen but yeah eventually I quit doing

7471.48 --> 7475.678999999999
that because I did realize that every

7473.28 --> 7477.079
time hallucinations like that because of

7475.679 --> 7480.36
pressure

7477.079 --> 7482.599
andage it seems to like be damaging on

7480.36 --> 7482.598999999999
your

7483.119 --> 7489.079
brain like if you do that enough it

7485.92 --> 7490.639
might actually leave scarring this is

7489.079 --> 7494.04
also

7490.639 --> 7497.52
why I'm a little bit worried about the

7494.04 --> 7499.88
recent experience of ttis because ttis

7497.52 --> 7503.2390000000005
might be the the expression of the

7499.88 --> 7505.88
damage that has been caused by the

7503.239 --> 7509.959999999999
hallucinations I'm very eager to try to

7505.88 --> 7512.8
figure out if I can like fold it back

7509.96 --> 7515.36
and I have I have actually folded it

7512.8 --> 7515.360000000001
back to a

7520.639 --> 7523.639
degree

7525.88 --> 7530.1990000000005
she's turning what are you talking about

7533.96 --> 7538.2390000000005
fbrs instantane what are you talking

7536.639 --> 7543.159000000001
about blunder

7538.239 --> 7548.199
23 no I've not instantaneous tears at

7543.159 --> 7551.638999999999
all I've actually been extremely low

7548.199 --> 7554.919999999999
emotion I've had big periods of em

7551.639 --> 7557.679
emotional expression a lot as you might

7554.92 --> 7562.32
have noticed you might have noticed that

7557.679 --> 7565.76
a little on oh here and there 82 yeah a

7562.32 --> 7568.92
little bit of emotions yeah yeah yeah

7565.76 --> 7571.84
well since February it's like my

7568.92 --> 7574.04
emotions went down to maximum one

7571.84 --> 7577.599
quarter of what they've been and

7574.04 --> 7580.559
thus I can't even get super angry

7577.599 --> 7582.88
anymore and I don't get emotional

7580.559 --> 7586.2390000000005
anymore

7582.88 --> 7588.639
in a negative way or in a positive way

7586.239 --> 7591.48
and I feel like it's necessary it's

7588.639 --> 7594.2390000000005
necessary to keep it lower emotion I

7591.48 --> 7597.598999999999
don't know if that's like spiritual

7594.239 --> 7600.079
anticipation to the eclipse to the the

7597.599 --> 7602.559
real energies that are going around

7600.079 --> 7605.119
because getting extremely emotional

7602.559 --> 7607.1990000000005
might be more dangerous than usual more

7605.119 --> 7611.119
damaging to me than

7607.199 --> 7613.36
usual or whether it is literally as an

7611.119 --> 7617.598999999999
proed procedure a subconscious procedure

7613.36 --> 7619.36
to avoid further damage and regenerating

7617.599 --> 7622.599
because of all the

7619.36 --> 7625.719
emotions that I have

7622.599 --> 7630.92
experienced cuz I used my emotion I used

7625.719 --> 7633.88
my rage wi to get stress out of my

7630.92 --> 7635.8
system I no longer am pressured with

7633.88 --> 7637.32
this kind of stress that I have to get

7635.8 --> 7641.320000000001
out of my

7637.32 --> 7642.159
system going resorting to rwind to do

7641.32 --> 7644.32
that

7642.159 --> 7646.48
it's it's not there anymore I have

7644.32 --> 7649.96
calmed

7646.48 --> 7653.239
down I don't have it bottled up inside

7649.96 --> 7653.2390000000005
anymore it's

7655.96 --> 7661.36
over like even with a

7658.8 --> 7662.360000000001
controversial painful subject as I

7661.36 --> 7666.558999999999
addressed

7662.36 --> 7666.558999999999
today with the whole Israel

7667.199 --> 7670.199
scenario

7670.44 --> 7675.36
right

7673.08 --> 7678.719
[Music]

7675.36 --> 7682.32
even when I made effort to be very harsh

7678.719 --> 7684.2390000000005
and straight forward and get to you in a

7682.32 --> 7689.88
way which I do

7684.239 --> 7692.32
do it didn't go like even half as hot as

7689.88 --> 7694.599
it used to like half a year ago when I I

7692.32 --> 7694.599
did

7694.639 --> 7703.4400000000005
that cuz my inner workings my inner

7700.079 --> 7706.199
chemistry has changed in the last few

7703.44 --> 7708.719
months like dramatically I am not the

7706.199 --> 7708.719
same

7713.4 --> 7718.92
person I mean the way I reflect upon

7716.239 --> 7722.199
information is the same it's just that

7718.92 --> 7726.119
what I'm dealing with continually on the

7722.199 --> 7729.96
inside has become dramatically different

7726.119 --> 7732.36
it really has so it's like I'm the same

7729.96 --> 7733.88
oh [Â __Â ] I'm the same

7732.36 --> 7736.88
person

7733.88 --> 7736.88
but

7740.079 --> 7745.0
whoa

7742.28 --> 7747.28
that's

7745.0 --> 7751.04
yeah yeah the tea was

7747.28 --> 7752.5199999999995
Dripping kind of over my socket the

7751.04 --> 7755.44
electric

7752.52 --> 7757.070000000001
socket got there just in

7755.44 --> 7760.36
time

7757.07 --> 7763.36
[Music]

7760.36 --> 7763.36
bro

7764.0 --> 7767.48
almost had a bit of an issue

7769.239 --> 7778.009999999999
there don't want to blow up my

7772.26 --> 7778.01
[Music]

7781.21 --> 7784.319
[Music]

7790.32 --> 7793.32
computer

7820.32 --> 7823.32
e

7835.01 --> 7839.66
[Music]

7843.36 --> 7846.469999999999
[Music]

7850.239 --> 7855.0599999999995
is

7851.95 --> 7855.0599999999995
[Music]

7863.32 --> 7866.119
all right

7868.52 --> 7876.2390000000005
yeah my cousin from stress of break up

7872.599 --> 7879.719
had hallucinations yeah well breaking

7876.239 --> 7882.919999999999
up the thing is if you're like with your

7879.719 --> 7886.04
internal workings have become like

7882.92 --> 7888.84
dependent interdependent dependent on

7886.04 --> 7892.239
the energies of another being

7888.84 --> 7895.04
there like being dependent on the loving

7892.239 --> 7899.119
support of another individual if you

7895.04 --> 7902.119
then break up then suddenly yeah you can

7899.119 --> 7905.92
have overdosages of

7902.119 --> 7905.92
stress to the point of

7905.96 --> 7909.4800000000005
hallucination that does

7910.239 --> 7913.239
happen

7925.079 --> 7930.679
it happened to my mother to be exact to

7928.679 --> 7933.52
the point where she went completely

7930.679 --> 7937.0
insane because of that because she had

7933.52 --> 7939.159000000001
made herself so interdependent on the on

7937.0 --> 7941.84
her relationship with my dad it's like

7939.159 --> 7945.04
her entire world view

7941.84 --> 7948.079
was based on that that relation was like

7945.04 --> 7950.32
holy and then when my dad couldn't take

7948.079 --> 7950.32
it

7950.36 --> 7956.44
anymore because it was getting so

7952.679 --> 7960.0
unbalanced and she was just ignoring the

7956.44 --> 7963.28
unbalance and pushing him

7960.0 --> 7966.679
around and then when my dad just

7963.28 --> 7970.119
couldn't take it anymore and

7966.679 --> 7973.119
left my mom just went completely

7970.119 --> 7973.119
nuts

7978.48 --> 7984.239
to the point where she at times was

7982.199 --> 7986.759999999999
hallucinating and

7984.239 --> 7989.48
hallucinating when she saw

7986.76 --> 7992.119000000001
me that's the craziest thing she like

7989.48 --> 7992.119
literally

7992.199 --> 7999.32
thought that I was my

7995.8 --> 8003.119000000001
dad and not just like acting out but

7999.32 --> 8006.0
really thinking that

8003.119 --> 8006.0
pretty [Â __Â ]

8028.719 --> 8034.84
up sorry about the dist actually have to

8031.8 --> 8034.84
clean up the mess

8036.36 --> 8044.36
here and it is quite a mess down

8040.0 --> 8044.36
there but it's it's

8056.44 --> 8061.5199999999995
done

8058.0 --> 8064.48
right anyway it's been an intense show

8061.52 --> 8066.1990000000005
thus far I can still keep going I mean I

8064.48 --> 8067.799999999999
still have coffee

8066.199 --> 8071.96
here

8067.8 --> 8071.96
fortunately no more Illuminati

8072.96 --> 8078.199
C I think I'm just going to have lunch

8075.559 --> 8081.559
right after the

8078.199 --> 8084.159
show I hope it's been interesting it's

8081.559 --> 8088.159000000001
been a little bit more

8084.159 --> 8088.159
Rowdy than the last couple of

8088.32 --> 8092.759999999999
shows and I mean it's good it's good to

8090.719 --> 8094.96
be a a little Rowdy every now and then

8092.76 --> 8098.88
there's Rowdy [Â __Â ] going on in the world

8094.96 --> 8102.28
and sometimes you just need to face it

8098.88 --> 8106.1990000000005
right sometimes it's a time of

8102.28 --> 8109.36
Confrontation to those dwelling in

8106.199 --> 8112.719
darkness without

8109.36 --> 8115.5199999999995
fear and today is one of those

8112.719 --> 8118.04
days I mean it's a hot

8115.52 --> 8122.159000000001
day

8118.04 --> 8125.36
so why not just heat it up right

8122.159 --> 8128.638999999999
I hope you guys have find it found it

8125.36 --> 8128.639
stimulating thus

8128.92 --> 8133.1990000000005
far some feedback would be

8133.76 --> 8136.76
good

8140.03 --> 8143.139999999999
[Music]

8143.199 --> 8147.678999999999
right and don't forget to Rogan it

8149.92 --> 8154.84
up

8151.719 --> 8154.84
watch what you missed

8155.52 --> 8160.639
after well there's a lot of Israel talk

8161.0 --> 8165.88
earlier so you can imagine where that oh

8163.639 --> 8169.96
you I think you were there yeah you were

8165.88 --> 8169.96
already there when I was talking about

8179.92 --> 8182.92
that

8183.32 --> 8190.079
you love Saturday shows oh thanks

8187.0 --> 8193.16
C I never really know ahead of time like

8190.079 --> 8195.0
how it's going to go on a Saturday show

8193.16 --> 8198.0
it's always

8195.0 --> 8200.12
like when I start out it's like I really

8198.0 --> 8203.519
don't know what's going to happen but

8200.12 --> 8205.880000000001
then at some point early in the show

8203.519 --> 8208.639000000001
it's like it it hits me okay it's going

8205.88 --> 8209.839999999998
to about be about this and today was

8208.639 --> 8212.839999999998
going to be

8209.84 --> 8212.84
about

8214.359 --> 8220.639000000001
Israel and now the second half is I

8218.359 --> 8220.639000000001
guess

8227.519 --> 8234.399
about about relationships

8231.319 --> 8236.399
and how they can burden and pollute you

8234.399 --> 8240.039999999999
as

8236.399 --> 8242.84
well and how that can influence you also

8240.04 --> 8242.84
when it breaks up

8244.399 --> 8249.08
so it's about that I mean it's something

8246.76 --> 8251.599
something that I have been dealing

8249.08 --> 8254.519
with and I'm going to get back to it

8251.599 --> 8257.16
every now and then in this case it was

8254.519 --> 8261.960000000001
triggered by somebody asking like oh

8257.16 --> 8261.96
where did you go in fed CU they didn't

8262.28 --> 8266.960000000001
know it's like yeah you're not showing

8265.24 --> 8269.84
up there yeah I

8266.96 --> 8273.8
know not even showing up in the

8269.84 --> 8273.8
chat I know I'm

8277.439 --> 8284.439
not it's

8279.559 --> 8289.08
like it just it got old to

8284.439 --> 8292.2
me and it really hadn't in all this

8289.08 --> 8295.039999999999
time it really hadn't I was like bearing

8292.2 --> 8298.319000000001
with it all this

8295.04 --> 8302.28
time and now it's just

8298.319 --> 8305.599
done it's like yeah

8302.28 --> 8308.439
it's if I'm going to like switch it on

8305.599 --> 8312.359
listen to that if I'm going to hear

8308.439 --> 8313.880000000001
anything new I'm going to be completely

8312.359 --> 8317.08
out of my mind

8313.88 --> 8322.16
surprised because there just isn't going

8317.08 --> 8325.08
to be anything new any new

8322.16 --> 8326.2
development there hasn't been any real

8325.08 --> 8329.639
new

8326.2 --> 8329.639000000001
development in

8329.719 --> 8336.119999999999
years the newest developments

8332.84 --> 8338.679
were that I that I

8336.12 --> 8340.92
named the the yeah what do you call the

8338.679 --> 8344.719000000001
confessional debating that was a new

8340.92 --> 8346.84
development that's like the last new

8344.719 --> 8348.759999999998
development that happened and

8346.84 --> 8350.960000000001
confessional debating seems to really be

8348.76 --> 8354.319
a thing

8350.96 --> 8356.08
now among these crazy astrophysicist

8354.319 --> 8359.359
YouTubers

8356.08 --> 8362.0
Etc but I mean there's no other new

8359.359 --> 8366.12
developments it's just just the same old

8362.0 --> 8369.84
same old and that's all it is out there

8366.12 --> 8372.519
the same familiar Roots it's just like

8369.84 --> 8374.639000000001
fed is just walking the same path it's

8372.519 --> 8377.719000000001
just like protecting its territory

8374.639 --> 8383.679
walking the same Circle walking the same

8377.719 --> 8383.678999999998
path and that's it I I can't do

8384.359 --> 8390.04
that I'm about

8387.08 --> 8392.359
development I have to find new grounds

8390.04 --> 8396.960000000001
I'm an exp

8392.359 --> 8401.76
Explorer I'm not a guard I'm an Explorer

8396.96 --> 8405.319
a guard keeps a territory safe an

8401.76 --> 8408.52
Explorer finds new territory I'm an

8405.319 --> 8408.519999999999
Explorer I'm not a

8413.439 --> 8418.880000000001
guard I'm not here to hold ground I'm

8416.479 --> 8419.64
here to find new ground and that's what

8418.88 --> 8421.279999999999
I

8419.64 --> 8423.199999999999
do

8421.28 --> 8424.76
I feel liberated standing on your own

8423.2 --> 8429.240000000002
yeah I

8424.76 --> 8432.800000000001
do lar and it's kind of weird because

8429.24 --> 8435.72
for years I thought that if I'd leave

8432.8 --> 8439.679999999998
I'd be really isolated and I'd lose

8435.72 --> 8443.279999999999
everything I'd lose my energy

8439.68 --> 8446.0
but since I broke free this

8443.28 --> 8447.960000000001
February turns out I didn't and that's

8446.0 --> 8449.439
why my shows have all become so

8447.96 --> 8454.8
incredibly

8449.439 --> 8457.6
long if all become like over two

8454.8 --> 8460.92
hours like at this point if I'm going to

8457.6 --> 8463.2
have a show that's shorter than 2 hours

8460.92 --> 8466.439
it's almost like a bad sign it's like a

8463.2 --> 8468.12
shocking thing like what less than 2

8466.439 --> 8471.12
hours what's

8468.12 --> 8471.12
wrong

8474.28 --> 8481.04
H right because my shower my shows are

8477.439 --> 8484.56
just at least two and a half hours

8481.04 --> 8488.84
usually around 3 and sometimes even up

8484.56 --> 8491.0
to 4 hours and that's just me just me

8488.84 --> 8495.68
having a

8491.0 --> 8495.68
show and that's now just how it

8496.64 --> 8503.519999999999
is broke free LOL

8500.2 --> 8503.52
haha so

8507.52 --> 8512.800000000001
funny fear of the unknown keep many

8511.16 --> 8514.479
stagnant

8512.8 --> 8517.08
yeah

8514.479 --> 8520.358999999999
well not me

8517.08 --> 8522.84
though I'm an

8520.359 --> 8526.16
Explorer I

8522.84 --> 8529.479
thrive on the UN

8526.16 --> 8531.56
unknown I love the unknown the unknown

8529.479 --> 8534.199999999999
is like an

8531.56 --> 8535.8
opportunity that's why I'm an Explorer

8534.2 --> 8540.12
yeah the

8535.8 --> 8543.358999999999
unknown is that which is in between I'm

8540.12 --> 8545.68
here to find the way through yeah well

8543.359 --> 8549.479000000001
everybody's like oh no this no that no

8545.68 --> 8552.04
this no that I'm like but what about

8549.479 --> 8555.358999999999
there ever thought about there in

8552.04 --> 8557.2
between yeah that's what I do I'm not

8555.359 --> 8560.0
afraid I'm not

8557.2 --> 8563.359
afraid to the point where I need to

8560.0 --> 8567.04
resort to a polarized position to find

8563.359 --> 8567.04
some kind of safety in apparent

8567.52 --> 8573.640000000001
numbers I don't need to hide among

8570.68 --> 8576.960000000001
others in a polarized position no I'm

8573.64 --> 8576.96
just here to find the way

8583.92 --> 8587.56
through I love the

8590.72 --> 8596.84
unknown and it even has reflected itself

8593.92 --> 8598.479
like in how my Visions

8596.84 --> 8601.84
work

8598.479 --> 8604.92
cuz a while ago like the way my Visions

8601.84 --> 8607.76
work became different I even explained

8604.92 --> 8610.8
that I don't know who caught on to that

8607.76 --> 8613.24
but like before my Visions had like this

8610.8 --> 8616.24
overarching thing that just grabbed into

8613.24 --> 8619.199999999999
the future a lot and

8616.24 --> 8621.92
recently I just started to realize that

8619.2 --> 8624.279
the way I the Visions unfolded

8621.92 --> 8627.359
themselves to me has become

8624.279 --> 8628.92
different and I can see less about the

8627.359 --> 8632.24
future

8628.92 --> 8634.479
now but what I do get to see is much

8632.24 --> 8638.8
more

8634.479 --> 8641.84
clear but the future has become in ways

8638.8 --> 8644.679999999998
unknown to me and it's

8641.84 --> 8647.279
like the most important part about it is

8644.68 --> 8650.399
that I'm okay with

8647.279 --> 8652.84
that not knowing the future used to

8650.399 --> 8655.358999999999
terrify me when I was

8652.84 --> 8657.8
younger I would be terrified that I

8655.359 --> 8660.399000000001
would end up developing myself and

8657.8 --> 8662.72
leaning on things that would suddenly be

8660.399 --> 8665.76
swept from underneath me and that it

8662.72 --> 8668.679999999998
would all be for nothing that was the

8665.76 --> 8670.72
fear that drove me partially into doing

8668.68 --> 8674.960000000001
this crazy Vision

8670.72 --> 8677.92
[Â __Â ] that I experienced to grab a whole

8674.96 --> 8680.519999999999
of My Future Self to try to collect

8677.92 --> 8682.84
moments to see what the future would be

8680.52 --> 8685.84
so that I could maneuver based on the

8682.84 --> 8688.479
anticipation of what I got to see and it

8685.84 --> 8691.439
all turned against me in

8688.479 --> 8692.96
ways it turned into a giant

8691.439 --> 8696.16
curse

8692.96 --> 8701.64
and that curse has

8696.16 --> 8704.16
ended I connected up with that that

8701.64 --> 8707.278999999999
Timeless experience I managed to

8704.16 --> 8709.88
communicate from my linear perspective

8707.279 --> 8710.960000000001
with that Timeless experience that I had

8709.88 --> 8715.438999999998
in the

8710.96 --> 8719.039999999999
past and managed to stabilize it and

8715.439 --> 8721.08
communicate that it can still ride along

8719.04 --> 8726.160000000002
but it's not going to snatch anything

8721.08 --> 8729.24
away anymore and it my future self which

8726.16 --> 8731.6
is now but from the perspective of how

8729.24 --> 8734.08
it happened then my future self managed

8731.6 --> 8736.399000000001
to finally communicate to my past self

8734.08 --> 8738.84
that was going through time experiencing

8736.399 --> 8741.8
trying to grab hold of the

8738.84 --> 8742.8
future that it's not necessary that I

8741.8 --> 8745.319
was

8742.8 --> 8750.358999999999
wrong that I was

8745.319 --> 8752.72
wrong to try and steal the future when

8750.359 --> 8756.399000000001
when not knowing the

8752.72 --> 8756.399
future is more

8759.24 --> 8766.0
rewarding it yields more it yields more

8762.8 --> 8768.519999999999
energy it is more constructive and that

8766.0 --> 8771.92
was the original purpose of it I tried

8768.52 --> 8775.439
to steal my the future knowing the

8771.92 --> 8778.84
future because I was

8775.439 --> 8782.16
afraid that what I've built would be for

8778.84 --> 8786.439
nothing in other words that I would

8782.16 --> 8789.56
lose while practically it turns out that

8786.439 --> 8793.399
I've lost more because of that fear of

8789.56 --> 8796.399
losing and then doing these things to

8793.399 --> 8796.399
myself

8796.52 --> 8803.68
spiritually than

8798.88 --> 8807.08
just trusting in God which effectively

8803.68 --> 8809.52
seems to yield more not knowing the

8807.08 --> 8814.08
future and trusting in God just yields

8809.52 --> 8818.2
more affect itively and that's something

8814.08 --> 8819.64
that I didn't believe I didn't believe

8818.2 --> 8822.640000000001
that when I was

8819.64 --> 8825.24
younger because of a lot of suffering

8822.64 --> 8827.199999999999
that I did go

8825.24 --> 8831.16
through I

8827.2 --> 8832.439
was convinced that control was necessary

8831.16 --> 8835.439
to

8832.439 --> 8835.439
prevent

8838.24 --> 8842.72
loss but it wasn't

8840.96 --> 8846.08
it was the other way around it's not the

8842.72 --> 8849.599999999999
control over the world and what will

8846.08 --> 8852.0
happen that prevents the loss it's only

8849.6 --> 8855.2
control over yourself and control over

8852.0 --> 8858.359
yourself means facing the issues you

8855.2 --> 8862.52
have and dealing with them and accepting

8858.359 --> 8865.6
them and letting them go and letting new

8862.52 --> 8867.68
issues arrive to deal with them and

8865.6 --> 8870.279
facing them and letting them go and

8867.68 --> 8872.92
that's nothing to do with the world if

8870.279 --> 8872.92
has to do with

8873.399 --> 8879.199999999999
yourself I learned

8876.12 --> 8881.04
that took me damn long enough although

8879.2 --> 8884.359
there's plenty of people out there that

8881.04 --> 8888.160000000002
never learned this ever so I'm lucky

8884.359 --> 8891.880000000001
that at the age of 44 I'm learning this

8888.16 --> 8894.279
at all cuz most people that have these

8891.88 --> 8898.92
types of issues with with themselves

8894.279 --> 8898.92
never learn it they never

8899.12 --> 8902.12
do

8904.56 --> 8908.72
the in between is what we call the inner

8906.6 --> 8912.720000000001
Plains that's interesting clearly I did

8908.72 --> 8912.72
not know that we call it

8913.52 --> 8918.76
that I

8915.319 --> 8922.68
just reference it as the Dark World

8918.76 --> 8922.68
Vision the great Timeless

8924.279 --> 8931.359
experience and through that experience I

8926.84 --> 8934.68
did reach out through time

8931.359 --> 8938.399000000001
I did way back then get to touch with my

8934.68 --> 8939.92
Consciousness things that I've

8938.399 --> 8944.358999999999
experien

8939.92 --> 8948.72
now in these times throughout the last

8944.359 --> 8951.640000000001
20 years and I I got this onetime

8948.72 --> 8954.96
experience experience

8951.64 --> 8956.88
experiencing all different things from

8954.96 --> 8958.8
the future in that one experience and

8956.88 --> 8962.519999999999
then when I came out of

8958.8 --> 8965.16
it I still remember the things that I

8962.52 --> 8970.279
would experience in the future but I

8965.16 --> 8973.399
couldn't put them together in in a

8970.279 --> 8977.08
usable fashion so my conclusion was is

8973.399 --> 8979.24
that Cassandra complex prevented me from

8977.08 --> 8981.439
being able to put

8979.24 --> 8983.92
together the things that I would

8981.439 --> 8987.24
experience in the future in order to be

8983.92 --> 8990.960000000001
able to actually constructively be able

8987.24 --> 8994.76
to do anything with them other than have

8990.96 --> 8994.759999999998
introspective feelings and

8995.08 --> 8999.92
thoughts that's the only thing that I

8997.56 --> 9004.92
effectively have been able to get out of

8999.92 --> 9004.92
it I've not been able to alter

9006.399 --> 9011.56
anything with my Timeless

9009.96 --> 9015.479
experience

9011.56 --> 9015.479
nothing absolutely

9016.84 --> 9021.08
nothing and it was hyper elusive as well

9019.68 --> 9023.960000000001
because a lot of things that I have

9021.08 --> 9023.96
experienced are

9024.04 --> 9032.399000000001
actually envisioning imaginations of

9028.6 --> 9034.08
what is going on now like hey this thing

9032.399 --> 9035.479
that's going to happen in a few days

9034.08 --> 9038.359
what is that going to be like is it

9035.479 --> 9040.96
going to be like this and then I have an

9038.359 --> 9044.720000000001
imagination about

9040.96 --> 9046.278999999999
it and then it doesn't happen at all

9044.72 --> 9049.278999999999
like it's

9046.279 --> 9052.359
discontinued I only imagined how it

9049.279 --> 9055.84
would happen it didn't actually happen

9052.359 --> 9058.800000000001
and in my vision in that big big big

9055.84 --> 9062.76
Vision a lot of those moments that

9058.8 --> 9066.96
didn't actually happen but that I did

9062.76 --> 9068.800000000001
Imagine in future time is part of what I

9066.96 --> 9071.399
experienced I experienced a lot of

9068.8 --> 9073.88
things that I imagined but that didn't

9071.399 --> 9076.319
end up happening but I didn't know that

9073.88 --> 9077.519999999999
about it I didn't know that it wouldn't

9076.319 --> 9081.92
end up

9077.52 --> 9081.92
happening as I experienced it

9083.84 --> 9089.68
this is a very

9086.68 --> 9093.720000000001
important parameter of the entire

9089.68 --> 9095.800000000001
experience that I figured out that a lot

9093.72 --> 9100.72
of the things that I have experienced in

9095.8 --> 9100.72
my vision were actually my future

9108.84 --> 9112.6
imaginations

9110.359 --> 9114.960000000001
isn't that

9112.6 --> 9118.04
remarkable I I mean maybe it isn't to

9114.96 --> 9118.039999999999
you guys it is to

9121.479 --> 9127.199999999999
me but also with that realization with

9124.8 --> 9130.039999999999
actually actively becoming aware of that

9127.2 --> 9134.0
and learning that in this

9130.04 --> 9138.84
ongoing parallel Timeless experience by

9134.0 --> 9141.84
realizing this I have decided

9138.84 --> 9141.84
that

9141.96 --> 9147.599999999999
it's actually

9144.319 --> 9151.88
practically not useful to continue

9147.6 --> 9156.84
having this happen having my past

9151.88 --> 9159.24
self get involved in my future self it

9156.84 --> 9163.479
it doesn't practically serve a purpose

9159.24 --> 9163.479
it only actually takes away my

9164.2 --> 9171.68
stability and so I've disconnected

9167.92 --> 9175.2
it and that's why now when I

9171.68 --> 9178.56
see when I basically tune into my Dark

9175.2 --> 9182.560000000001
World Vision side when I look

9178.56 --> 9185.039999999999
Beyond use my Dark World Vision view not

9182.56 --> 9187.6
like literally experiencing that

9185.04 --> 9190.640000000001
experience but like looking tapping into

9187.6 --> 9193.6
it I no longer see the

9190.64 --> 9195.84
future not like I used to there's no

9193.6 --> 9198.6
more like fragments that are coming to

9195.84 --> 9200.359
me like oh this is around this like this

9198.6 --> 9201.52
might happen it's not happening like

9200.359 --> 9204.279
that

9201.52 --> 9207.0
anymore this setting of the Dark World

9204.279 --> 9211.04
Vision has changed because of this

9207.0 --> 9213.08
realization and now I no longer see the

9211.04 --> 9217.319000000001
future and it's

9213.08 --> 9220.479
better I have more stability more power

9217.319 --> 9222.96
more clarity now that I don't see the

9220.479 --> 9222.96
future

9225.84 --> 9231.8
anymore dreams of the future provide

9228.72 --> 9233.96
hope unless they do exactly the opposite

9231.8 --> 9237.679999999998
of that

9233.96 --> 9239.88
clearly I mean dreams of the future

9237.68 --> 9243.279
also

9239.88 --> 9247.92
entail technological

9243.279 --> 9247.92
advancements that are

9249.68 --> 9257.399
cataclysmic right technological

9253.12 --> 9261.479000000001
escalation is also part of the future

9257.399 --> 9262.68
that you could dream about

9261.479 --> 9265.56
but then

9262.68 --> 9268.399
again there is the realization and this

9265.56 --> 9271.24
is a very important thing within the

9268.399 --> 9275.519999999999
apocalypse is the realization of what's

9271.24 --> 9278.24
actually fake what has been made up what

9275.52 --> 9283.720000000001
is science fiction that is claimed to be

9278.24 --> 9286.76
real and that is imposed on us like it's

9283.72 --> 9290.599999999999
real like Medical Science

9286.76 --> 9295.479
Fiction cosmological science fiction

9290.6 --> 9297.720000000001
ition transhuman science

9295.479 --> 9300.319
fiction like

9297.72 --> 9302.24
possibilities like for example the idea

9300.319 --> 9305.359
like oh we're going to upload our

9302.24 --> 9307.16
Consciousness into a computer I mean if

9305.359 --> 9310.08
you don't realize at this point that

9307.16 --> 9312.88
that's just complete science fiction

9310.08 --> 9315.279
nonsense that that's like

9312.88 --> 9318.16
earli 20th

9315.279 --> 9321.319000000001
century thinking based science fiction

9318.16 --> 9324.16
and is completely in practice IAL in

9321.319 --> 9326.039999999999
every in every aspect like if you're not

9324.16 --> 9327.72
there yet then like yeah you're going to

9326.04 --> 9330.52
have a lot of trouble figuring out

9327.72 --> 9330.519999999999
what's real and what

9331.04 --> 9335.68
isn't

9332.6 --> 9338.08
right if you're still holding on to the

9335.68 --> 9340.76
medical model of the 20th century thanks

9338.08 --> 9343.12
to the Rockefeller

9340.76 --> 9344.76
foundation and all the Medical Science

9343.12 --> 9346.68
Fiction that is in there if you're still

9344.76 --> 9348.64
holding on to that and you really think

9346.68 --> 9351.64
it's real then you're in

9348.64 --> 9351.64
trouble

9352.12 --> 9360.359
right all these deep realizations about

9356.319 --> 9363.92
what re is real and what isn't I hadn't

9360.359 --> 9367.0
fully developed

9363.92 --> 9370.24
that when I was younger when I had

9367.0 --> 9373.359
initiated this big Vision the only thing

9370.24 --> 9376.08
that I did know about was about the

9373.359 --> 9378.56
illusion of

9376.08 --> 9381.92
heliocentrism I did know that was like

9378.56 --> 9384.84
the one thing that I did know like hey

9381.92 --> 9387.960000000001
the Earth is flat It's contained outer

9384.84 --> 9389.92
space is fake but there is this process

9387.96 --> 9393.919999999998
where this religion where we're trying

9389.92 --> 9398.76
to create it we're creating space we're

9393.92 --> 9402.479
creating how we think of it how we think

9398.76 --> 9404.72
it should be possible and I was invested

9402.479 --> 9405.96
into that and that's what where Ballwin

9404.72 --> 9411.64
came

9405.96 --> 9414.08
from so that part I had I did have that

9411.64 --> 9416.76
under control but Medical Science

9414.08 --> 9421.16
Fiction I had no idea about

9416.76 --> 9425.08
that was very torturous even during the

9421.16 --> 9428.479
visions that the 2020 moment was when I

9425.08 --> 9429.48
experienced that in my Visions I was

9428.479 --> 9430.64
absolutely

9429.48 --> 9434.72
[Applause]

9430.64 --> 9438.88
terrified because I thought it was all

9434.72 --> 9442.358999999999
real when I was experiencing that Vision

9438.88 --> 9446.72
now when I eventually met those times in

9442.359 --> 9449.359
2020 and and Beyond in the real linear

9446.72 --> 9452.24
timeline I wasn't scared at all because

9449.359 --> 9454.479000000001
I had learned so much through German new

9452.24 --> 9457.479
medicine through my

9454.479 --> 9457.479
healer

9459.52 --> 9466.560000000001
about the science fiction the Medical

9462.16 --> 9469.0
Science Fiction that has has rooted

9466.56 --> 9475.08
itself into modern medicine since the

9469.0 --> 9476.92
20th Century I didn't know that at all

9475.08 --> 9480.6
when I initiated the

9476.92 --> 9482.92
vision when I was 17 I didn't know any

9480.6 --> 9485.960000000001
of

9482.92 --> 9490.52
that I didn't even yeah I'm not going to

9485.96 --> 9490.519999999999
say anything further but you get the

9494.319 --> 9502.68
picture so when you see the future but

9498.2 --> 9502.68
you don't have the knowledge built

9504.24 --> 9516.199999999999
up that you need to have a good logical

9511.279 --> 9519.399000000001
sound stable durable perspective on what

9516.2 --> 9521.08
actually happens in the future it can be

9519.399 --> 9523.519999999999
nightmarish and

9521.08 --> 9526.16
detrimental it's like oh you get to see

9523.52 --> 9527.479000000001
20 years into the future and you see all

9526.16 --> 9530.439
this event that's happening and you're

9527.479 --> 9532.399
like oh my God ah how the [Â __Â ] do we

9530.439 --> 9535.319
deal with that oh my God it's going to

9532.399 --> 9537.24
end the world's going to end and then 20

9535.319 --> 9539.119999999999
years later you're like holy [Â __Â ] I

9537.24 --> 9543.319
learned so much this is fake that is

9539.12 --> 9546.160000000002
fake this is fake I'm like oh that thing

9543.319 --> 9548.359
I was totally terrified about that I saw

9546.16 --> 9551.84
into the future 20 years ago turns out

9548.359 --> 9555.800000000001
to be mostly fake based on things that

9551.84 --> 9558.52
aren't really dangerous that are twisted

9555.8 --> 9561.358999999999
and it turns out not to be that big of a

9558.52 --> 9561.359
deal at all

9562.399 --> 9566.84
yeah I didn't know that when I was

9567.6 --> 9575.359
younger it's a big lesson I learned in a

9572.56 --> 9575.359
very harsh

9576.12 --> 9582.880000000001
way and it points at a

9581.04 --> 9585.359
uniform

9582.88 --> 9588.438999999998
uniform esoteric

9585.359 --> 9590.2
response from the spirit of Christ and

9588.439 --> 9592.84
that is

9590.2 --> 9593.640000000001
you should have trusted God you should

9592.84 --> 9596.72
have

9593.64 --> 9599.84
trusted the truth

9596.72 --> 9602.84
knowing when you know

9599.84 --> 9605.880000000001
things you shouldn't have

9602.84 --> 9609.6
fear but I chose to

9605.88 --> 9609.599999999999
look without

9610.04 --> 9615.92
knowing and so there was a lot of fear

9613.88 --> 9617.72
because I didn't have the knowledge that

9615.92 --> 9621.04
I needed to

9617.72 --> 9624.96
properly understand what what I was

9621.04 --> 9627.479000000001
seeing I should have just trusted God

9624.96 --> 9629.759999999998
but I didn't and so I got a whole bunch

9627.479 --> 9629.76
of

9636.88 --> 9642.599999999999
nightmares what do you know can can

9640.279 --> 9648.399000000001
cause constant urge to

9642.6 --> 9649.84
cough uh it's mostly irritation yeah I

9648.399 --> 9651.72
mean coughing

9649.84 --> 9654.880000000001
reinforces

9651.72 --> 9657.16
itself if you cough if you make a habit

9654.88 --> 9660.759999999998
or you think it's useful to

9657.16 --> 9664.0
cough then coughing will start to cause

9660.76 --> 9667.960000000001
this irritation that will make you want

9664.0 --> 9670.88
to cough more I learn to stop

9667.96 --> 9674.119999999999
coughing like I don't

9670.88 --> 9678.24
cough I just don't do it even if it's

9674.12 --> 9679.800000000001
like I got mucus or whatever well I'll

9678.24 --> 9682.439
just

9679.8 --> 9685.319
scrape it out of there or maybe if it

9682.439 --> 9688.399
gets really dramatic I'll cough like or

9685.319 --> 9692.439
something but I don't like

9688.399 --> 9695.88
cough like normal people do because that

9692.439 --> 9695.880000000001
reinforces more

9698.359 --> 9705.439
coughing it basically comes down to stop

9701.64 --> 9705.439
it just stop doing

9706.0 --> 9709.8
it is the coughing good for getting rid

9708.72 --> 9712.08
of toxin

9709.8 --> 9714.599999999999
no no it is

9712.08 --> 9718.399
not it causes

9714.6 --> 9720.08
irritation and potential inflammation if

9718.399 --> 9723.039999999999
there is any kind of

9720.08 --> 9725.399
risk because you're in that phase of

9723.04 --> 9728.319000000001
your metabolic

9725.399 --> 9730.439
processes so no coughing is not good for

9728.319 --> 9733.479
anything except for if you're

9730.439 --> 9735.92
accidentally choking on on your drink or

9733.479 --> 9738.84
something yeah if you have to get the

9735.92 --> 9740.92
Liquid directly out of your air out of

9738.84 --> 9744.279
your air pipe yeah you need to cough it

9740.92 --> 9747.04
out or you're going to choke but other

9744.279 --> 9750.800000000001
than that no coughing isn't good for

9747.04 --> 9750.800000000001
getting rid of toxins at

9752.52 --> 9760.439
all I learned to stop

9755.8 --> 9762.96
coughing like in my early 20s like it's

9760.439 --> 9765.399
a discipline just like don't respond to

9762.96 --> 9768.759999999998
the itch don't respond to the itch just

9765.399 --> 9769.72
ignore it ignore it ignore it ignore it

9768.76 --> 9771.68
guess what

9769.72 --> 9773.119999999999
if you ignore it and you really keep

9771.68 --> 9775.880000000001
ignoring yeah that's kind of like an

9773.12 --> 9778.08
itch you're that you're not scratching

9775.88 --> 9781.119999999999
it's tedious it can drive you nuts it

9778.08 --> 9784.12
can give you literal itch

9781.12 --> 9788.92
attacks eventually you get good at it

9784.12 --> 9791.2
and guess what it goes away Way quicker

9788.92 --> 9794.04
and then instead of like having to cough

9791.2 --> 9797.52
for like 3 days in a row all

9794.04 --> 9799.76
day you have a bit of an itch there that

9797.52 --> 9801.68
goes away in half an hour hour and

9799.76 --> 9805.6
doesn't come

9801.68 --> 9808.720000000001
back yeah that's what I have to deal

9805.6 --> 9811.359
with even as like my roommates who

9808.72 --> 9814.88
doesn't have that discipline I hear her

9811.359 --> 9814.880000000001
C coughing all the

9815.88 --> 9823.96
time I've been hearing her cough a

9819.76 --> 9826.359
lot and I'm like only you just stop

9823.96 --> 9826.358999999999
doing

9827.12 --> 9834.800000000001
that you don't need to do that it's way

9831.04 --> 9834.800000000001
better for your throat not to do

9835.439 --> 9841.16
that and I mean for me especially

9838.479 --> 9841.96
because I'm a smoker and if you're also

9841.16 --> 9845.119999999999
a

9841.96 --> 9847.8
smoker and you and you don't suppress

9845.12 --> 9850.720000000001
your coughing dude that's like Double

9847.8 --> 9853.72
Trouble on your throat that that could

9850.72 --> 9853.72
like lead to bad

9853.88 --> 9859.599999999999
things coughing is not good for

9858.04 --> 9862.080000000002
you

9859.6 --> 9866.640000000001
like itch coughing that's not good for

9862.08 --> 9871.24
you it doesn't solve

9866.64 --> 9875.278999999999
anything it's not stimulating for for

9871.24 --> 9878.479
healing at all what it does do is it it

9875.279 --> 9881.12
basically creates temporary

9878.479 --> 9884.199999999999
inflammation that's the irritation

9881.12 --> 9887.279
that's what why it gets itchy so that

9884.2 --> 9890.92
might stimulate the lymph nodes around

9887.279 --> 9891.84
that area maybe increase blood flow to

9890.92 --> 9895.68
that

9891.84 --> 9899.279
point but I mean if you then just keep

9895.68 --> 9899.279
having that it's not going to

9902.16 --> 9908.96
help I mean there's way better ways to

9905.319 --> 9912.479
deal with it just like have good blood

9908.96 --> 9915.438999999998
flow agents consume good blood flow

9912.479 --> 9919.319
agents like get nitrous

9915.439 --> 9923.359
oxide and you like eat a lot of chili

9919.319 --> 9925.8
pepper right that will do the same thing

9923.359 --> 9929.0
without locally

9925.8 --> 9929.0
burdening that

9929.12 --> 9934.560000000001
SWOT with the constant pressure bang

9932.439 --> 9939.76
coughing is like bang this constant

9934.56 --> 9939.76
slapping of your throat it's not

9944.64 --> 9950.479
good isn't Chili Pepper yeah but that's

9947.359 --> 9954.479000000001
the entire Point duper

9950.479 --> 9954.479
it stimulates blood

9954.96 --> 9967.399
flow yeah disease a lot of it is the

9960.72 --> 9968.96
necessity to get rid of processed stuff

9967.399 --> 9971.68
like cleaning

9968.96 --> 9974.278999999999
up how do you clean up you need

9971.68 --> 9979.64
transport you need the logistics for the

9974.279 --> 9982.399000000001
garbage men to get rid of the junk so to

9979.64 --> 9984.599999999999
get it to your liver and to your kidneys

9982.399 --> 9987.479
where you can eventually completely get

9984.6 --> 9991.04
rid of it out of your system you need

9987.479 --> 9995.438999999998
blood flow to make that happen right if

9991.04 --> 9997.640000000001
you have no blood flow then like the

9995.439 --> 10002.399
disease is going to last

9997.64 --> 10004.56
longer the phase which you have disease

10002.399 --> 10008.199999999999
discomfort is going to last longer

10004.56 --> 10012.6
because you need proper Logistics to get

10008.2 --> 10012.6
rid of all the toxins that are

10022.56 --> 10029.6
happening try not to cough for half hour

10025.319 --> 10029.6
that's good try not to cough

10031.439 --> 10039.56
forever right and to assist it you can

10035.12 --> 10040.880000000001
take the tip that was told earlier like

10039.56 --> 10044.24
take a spoon of

10040.88 --> 10047.88
Honey that'll soften it up it'll assist

10044.24 --> 10052.6
you in in not coughing make it a bit

10047.88 --> 10057.039999999999
easier and honey also has like

10052.6 --> 10060.6
uh yeah what they call it disinfecting

10057.04 --> 10060.6
qualities like it's

10067.84 --> 10072.84
good

10069.76 --> 10074.960000000001
forever yeah I mean if you're only

10072.84 --> 10076.479
trying to like oh I don't have to cough

10074.96 --> 10079.679999999998
for half an hour well what are you going

10076.479 --> 10081.679999999998
to do then just save it all up and then

10079.68 --> 10084.439
cough even harder after half an hour

10081.68 --> 10084.439
what's the point of

10086.64 --> 10092.479
that what I'm trying to tell you is it's

10089.359 --> 10095.720000000001
better to just try to completely work it

10092.479 --> 10099.92
out of your system basically forbid

10095.72 --> 10102.84
coughing to yourself like no it's not

10099.92 --> 10107.319
okay to cough it's only

10102.84 --> 10107.319
bad you want to do it it's

10109.0 --> 10115.439
bad get that through to you like

10111.88 --> 10117.759999999998
basically like pass a internal law to

10115.439 --> 10120.64
your system like yeah that coughing

10117.76 --> 10123.0
thing that we have this habit of doing

10120.64 --> 10126.76
it's bad it needs to stop you need to

10123.0 --> 10126.76
find a better solution to these

10127.0 --> 10133.24
problems but I mean the younger you

10129.6 --> 10135.640000000001
start the better I had to start it in my

10133.24 --> 10135.64
early

10136.479 --> 10143.039999999999
20s and since I learned that I don't

10140.16 --> 10146.92
have trouble with

10143.04 --> 10148.84
it it really universally helps with any

10146.92 --> 10151.64
what we would know as flu type

10148.84 --> 10151.64
situations

10157.399 --> 10164.56
too but yeah it does take

10161.76 --> 10167.68
discipline but and it's easy look if

10164.56 --> 10170.199999999999
you're already like all the time doing

10167.68 --> 10172.68
that right now it's very tough to then

10170.2 --> 10175.319000000001
subtly start oh now I have to quit

10172.68 --> 10178.04
you're already into a cough spiral I'm

10175.319 --> 10181.92
not expecting you to just stop just like

10178.04 --> 10185.160000000002
that the point is you have to feel it

10181.92 --> 10187.88
coming and then

10185.16 --> 10191.56
preemptively tell your system coughing

10187.88 --> 10194.679999999998
is bad let's not cough let's not get

10191.56 --> 10196.319
there let not allow it to get to that

10194.68 --> 10199.439
point where you can't stop coughing

10196.319 --> 10202.519999999999
anymore if you're already deep into it

10199.439 --> 10204.960000000001
and it keeps happening yeah then to quit

10202.52 --> 10207.84
is very

10204.96 --> 10210.278999999999
tough you might just have to set it

10207.84 --> 10214.72
out the point

10210.279 --> 10216.960000000001
is you have to prevent yourself from

10214.72 --> 10219.88
getting to that

10216.96 --> 10223.919999999998
point drank a lot of well don't drink it

10219.88 --> 10226.519999999999
all at once it's just a little bit at a

10223.92 --> 10228.239
time so that it has a a topical

10226.52 --> 10231.800000000001
influence in your

10228.239 --> 10233.92
throat just engorging quantities of

10231.8 --> 10237.239
honey it doesn't really help you it just

10233.92 --> 10237.239
gives you a sugar

10238.279 --> 10243.479000000001
rush clearing your lungs is good though

10241.279 --> 10246.12
yeah but coughing doesn't help you clear

10243.479 --> 10246.119999999999
your lungs

10247.64 --> 10252.56
clear

10249.72 --> 10256.56
like unless you have

10252.56 --> 10259.56
FL and then you cough up the FL in like

10256.56 --> 10262.8
two or three coughs and scrape the rest

10259.56 --> 10266.039999999999
that's all you need yeah coughing the

10262.8 --> 10268.96
itching coughing cycle is not good for

10266.04 --> 10272.12
clearing your lungs it isn't it doesn't

10268.96 --> 10272.119999999999
do anything good for your

10277.52 --> 10287.42
lungs

10280.36 --> 10287.42
[Music]

10290.359 --> 10296.52
don't C just feeling your throat all

10292.64 --> 10301.0
right well then just take it easy

10296.52 --> 10304.6
and just make sure you you let it give

10301.0 --> 10304.6
it time to calm down

10304.84 --> 10311.68
derer where does that come from I don't

10307.6 --> 10318.0
know where that come comes from

10311.68 --> 10321.92
maybe from somewhere probably that comes

10318.0 --> 10325.88
yeah maybe if you actually say something

10321.92 --> 10328.399
more specific I could give you an answer

10325.88 --> 10328.399
carot

10332.08 --> 10339.08
3

10335.08 --> 10341.92
FL well that comes from your lungs

10339.08 --> 10346.479
uh from your lymph nodes in your lungs

10341.92 --> 10350.04
and it is part of helping you clear out

10346.479 --> 10352.96
stuff right but it's really mostly there

10350.04 --> 10356.92
to help clear out things like

10352.96 --> 10356.919999999998
dust superficial

10359.08 --> 10364.2
stuff so cough helps not if you keep

10362.88 --> 10367.438999999998
stuck in a

10364.2 --> 10372.16
cycle and you don't even need to really

10367.439 --> 10372.16
cough to get rid of FL most of

10373.76 --> 10379.76
it right if you keep

10376.6 --> 10382.92
coughing then that will

10379.76 --> 10385.399
stimulate the yeah the nerves that will

10382.92 --> 10387.64
then get irritated which will make you

10385.399 --> 10390.358999999999
create more

10387.64 --> 10393.0
FL it will just keep going and going and

10390.359 --> 10395.6
going and it wouldn't really clean

10393.0 --> 10395.6
anything up

10395.68 --> 10402.56
anymore was what kind of stupid question

10398.76 --> 10406.2
get the [Â __Â ] out of here just a piece of

10402.56 --> 10406.199999999999
[Â __Â ] go [Â __Â ]

10408.8 --> 10413.239
yourself Oppositional Defiant

10414.239 --> 10420.8
wankers endless

10417.08 --> 10420.8
whining go [Â __Â ]

10427.439 --> 10430.439
yourself

10452.52 --> 10460.319000000001
wow think I've been almost going

10456.359 --> 10460.319
for almost 3 hours

10486.52 --> 10495.6
God invented coughing for

10490.16 --> 10495.6
reason I already gave you the reason

10495.96 --> 10503.759999999998
yeah just like

10499.12 --> 10507.04
anything when you overdo it it becomes a

10503.76 --> 10511.12
detriment like with everything in nature

10507.04 --> 10512.439
so yeah coughing helps you get rid of

10511.12 --> 10515.880000000001
especially

10512.439 --> 10519.800000000001
dust that may Gather in your lungs it

10515.88 --> 10521.96
helps you to clean it up but if you just

10519.8 --> 10525.759999999998
keep

10521.96 --> 10528.438999999998
coughing eventually it will outlive its

10525.76 --> 10532.68
uselessness and be its usefulness and

10528.439 --> 10532.68
become a detriment and that's my entire

10533.8 --> 10540.64
Point yeah continually

10537.12 --> 10542.560000000001
coughing it's like doesn't help anything

10540.64 --> 10545.88
it just

10542.56 --> 10545.88
burdens your

10547.239 --> 10550.239
system

10551.56 --> 10555.88
will drinking a lot of water help no not

10557.279 --> 10563.0
necessarily drinking a lot a lot of

10559.76 --> 10566.359
water will help when you subtly feel

10563.0 --> 10569.52
really thirsty that's when it will

10566.359 --> 10571.92
help just chugging water is not going to

10569.52 --> 10573.960000000001
help anything it only helps you when

10571.92 --> 10575.88
you're really thirsty CU that's when

10573.96 --> 10580.239
your system is like okay we need water

10575.88 --> 10580.239
now we need it to process things

10580.52 --> 10584.08
and then you need to drink

10592.96 --> 10598.519999999999
water but if you're in the middle of

10595.239 --> 10602.479
this duper what you need

10598.52 --> 10604.68
especially is to use some vitamin C

10602.479 --> 10607.239
because that's going to be very helpful

10604.68 --> 10610.56
for every part of

10607.239 --> 10612.8
you topically locally through your

10610.56 --> 10617.519999999999
bloodstream and your

10612.8 --> 10617.519999999999
organs vitamin C make sure to take

10620.12 --> 10625.239000000001
it now you can of course also just like

10623.359 --> 10627.720000000001
use lemon

10625.239 --> 10630.399
squeeze with a bit of

10627.72 --> 10634.319
honey that's also a way of taking

10630.399 --> 10635.92
vitamin C but it is very useful to get

10634.319 --> 10640.479
vitamin

10635.92 --> 10643.92
C like I take vitamin C every day and

10640.479 --> 10648.438999999998
because I take vitamin C every day I

10643.92 --> 10651.319
never get sick like this ever like I

10648.439 --> 10654.56
haven't been sick in

10651.319 --> 10657.239
years I get a bit sniffy sometimes and

10654.56 --> 10660.0
then like after half an hour or an hour

10657.239 --> 10662.239
it's gone and it doesn't come back and

10660.0 --> 10664.16
I'm perfectly fine and then they're like

10842.68 --> 10846.92
might need to wait just just get some

10845.08 --> 10849.92
vitamin

10846.92 --> 10849.92
C

10851.399 --> 10855.96
most of the time when I get sick these

10853.56 --> 10859.278999999999
days I think it's because of my diet

10855.96 --> 10863.319
yeah well it will be an influence like

10859.279 --> 10863.319000000001
what you eat matters a

10864.8 --> 10873.08
lot like being sick a lot of the time is

10869.84 --> 10875.68
just your body being like hey we got a

10873.08 --> 10879.12
lot of garbage that is built up we need

10875.68 --> 10881.479000000001
to get rid of it get the cleaning mode

10879.12 --> 10884.68
you get

10881.479 --> 10887.8
sick if you ensure you don't have any

10884.68 --> 10891.84
weird stray meals that are dubious or

10887.8 --> 10895.759999999998
really processed or whatever or very

10891.84 --> 10898.399
non-organic then you don't build up the

10895.76 --> 10902.319
layer of

10898.399 --> 10902.319
crap and then you don't get

10903.319 --> 10908.64
sick oh look who's there [Â __Â ] piece

10907.08 --> 10912.439
of [Â __Â ]

10908.64 --> 10914.88
oh who got who got banned at ow Benjamin

10912.439 --> 10918.76
[Â __Â ] with

10914.88 --> 10918.759999999998
a stalking piece of

10925.47 --> 10928.67
[Music]

10932.72 --> 10937.16
[Â __Â ] they're slightly bigger than yeah

10935.279 --> 10940.0
just leave them alone duper just leave

10937.16 --> 10941.479
your tomato uh your oranges alone that's

10940.0 --> 10945.6
way too

10941.479 --> 10950.76
small just get some fresh

10945.6 --> 10954.56
ones or get some organic vitamin

10950.76 --> 10954.56
C capsules or

10966.84 --> 10969.84
tablets

10973.399 --> 10978.64
I know some PE who drink alcohol and

10975.16 --> 10983.359
always get sick yeah alcohol builds up a

10978.64 --> 10987.278999999999
lot of crap in your body it's very

10983.359 --> 10990.12
toxic like alcohol actually makes you

10987.279 --> 10993.439
require a recovery

10990.12 --> 10993.439
period every

10993.52 --> 10999.640000000001
time like if you drink alcohol you need

10996.479 --> 11002.239
a recovery period if you keep drinking

10999.64 --> 11003.92
especially daily you don't get the

11002.239 --> 11006.039999999999
recovery period and then it keeps

11003.92 --> 11007.479
building up and up and up until the

11006.04 --> 11011.0
point where your body is going to like

11007.479 --> 11013.278999999999
force you like okay no more we now we're

11011.0 --> 11016.16
going to enforce we're going to go on

11013.279 --> 11017.6
strike and enforce the recovery period

11016.16 --> 11019.76
and that's when you get sick and then

11017.6 --> 11021.92
when you get sick you don't drink cuz it

11019.76 --> 11024.12
doesn't feel right and even if you do it

11021.92 --> 11026.72
doesn't work and then you get more sick

11024.12 --> 11029.720000000001
until you literally can't drink

11026.72 --> 11029.72
anymore

11030.56 --> 11033.199999999999
that's how that

11036.319 --> 11041.76
works I'm so glad I don't have those

11038.92 --> 11043.399
issues anymore since I quit drinking all

11041.76 --> 11047.56
forms of

11043.399 --> 11047.56
alcohol in January

11048.319 --> 11054.119999999999
2023 let the liquor gu you yeah

11056.72 --> 11059.72
goody

11067.52 --> 11074.0
and I'm not saying hey none of you

11069.479 --> 11077.16
should never ever drink alcohol I

11074.0 --> 11081.04
mean I'm just saying if you do you're

11077.16 --> 11081.039999999999
going to need a recovery

11085.76 --> 11089.64
period the recovery period is usually

11088.56 --> 11092.92
like a

11089.64 --> 11094.399
day up to 3 days depending it also

11092.92 --> 11095.84
depends on how heavy you're going to be

11094.399 --> 11099.0
drinking if you're going to drink a lot

11095.84 --> 11101.92
well you're going to need some more time

11099.0 --> 11101.92
to process

11104.439 --> 11111.319
that if you're going to be drinking it

11107.8 --> 11114.039999999999
will require at least a

11111.319 --> 11116.0
day even if you like drink one or two

11114.04 --> 11117.720000000001
beers or something I mean it will it

11116.0 --> 11120.239
will just take that extra time you won't

11117.72 --> 11123.278999999999
don't have like a hangover necessarily

11120.239 --> 11127.399
but your metabolism is just going to

11123.279 --> 11129.2
have to deal with with that situation

11127.399 --> 11132.519999999999
and it takes some

11129.2 --> 11134.68
time it's going to make you tap into

11132.52 --> 11137.479000000001
your fat reserves and your vitamin

11134.68 --> 11140.130000000001
reserves to deal with it it's just it's

11137.479 --> 11143.269999999999
just what it is that that

11140.13 --> 11143.269999999999
[Music]

11146.64 --> 11149.64
happens

11167.359 --> 11171.800000000001
all right I'm going to take a two-minute

11168.72 --> 11171.8
break and I'll be right

11176.56 --> 11179.56
back

11206.52 --> 11209.52
e

11236.52 --> 11239.52
e

11266.439 --> 11269.439
for

11276.62 --> 11279.719000000001
[Music]

11291.12 --> 11296.439
still no Globe no proof of a globe must

11294.04 --> 11298.880000000001
be frustrating yeah yeah

11296.439 --> 11302.319
yeah none of

11298.88 --> 11305.759999999998
that milk of

11302.319 --> 11308.399
magnesium well magnesium can I don't

11305.76 --> 11313.439
know about milk of magnesium

11308.399 --> 11317.319
but magnesium can definitely soothe the

11313.439 --> 11320.16
nerves I mean it soothes tooth AE as

11317.319 --> 11322.359
well that's something that I figured out

11320.16 --> 11323.6
you can it can help with which is

11322.359 --> 11326.720000000001
extremely

11323.6 --> 11329.76
useful so maybe it that could help if

11326.72 --> 11332.8
you just kind of gargle with it that

11329.76 --> 11332.800000000001
might actually help a

11336.96 --> 11342.88
bit I've never really had to try that

11339.76 --> 11347.2
because I haven't had like a sore throat

11342.88 --> 11351.278999999999
from coughing in 20 years at least

11347.2 --> 11353.560000000001
so I just I really I've just never had

11351.279 --> 11353.560000000001
that

11356.359 --> 11359.359
anymore

11386.96 --> 11390.239
all right anyway I hope you guys have

11388.8 --> 11394.039999999999
been enjoying the

11390.239 --> 11397.96
show been good having

11394.04 --> 11397.960000000001
you kicking a bunch of

11403.279 --> 11408.2
trolls had two coffees which I don't

11405.92 --> 11410.04
think I've ever had on the show I'm

11408.2 --> 11414.2
surprised I'm not

11410.04 --> 11414.2
like getting all weird from

11416.319 --> 11419.319
it

11423.12 --> 11430.2
feeling of Auto irritation well just let

11425.399 --> 11430.199999999999
it go duper just try to not focus on

11432.6 --> 11440.84
it but yeah maybe the uh magnesium tip

11438.319 --> 11440.84
is a good

11442.04 --> 11448.04
one like just

11445.08 --> 11450.479
have something like

11448.04 --> 11453.12
magnesium

11450.479 --> 11455.72
citrate and just put it in a bit in a

11453.12 --> 11457.800000000001
bit of water and just gargo with it see

11455.72 --> 11461.199999999999
if that

11457.8 --> 11465.438999999998
helps consult a position

11461.2 --> 11469.479000000001
no that's completely pointless

11465.439 --> 11473.359
CLE you should know better than

11469.479 --> 11476.278999999999
that seriously who the [Â __Â ] consults a

11473.359 --> 11479.239
physician with those types of issues

11476.279 --> 11479.239
that's just stupid

11492.279 --> 11496.92
especially in these times like who the

11494.319 --> 11496.92
[Â __Â ] does

11497.84 --> 11503.56
that we just start

11500.64 --> 11505.599999999999
to unleash all kinds of nonsense

11503.56 --> 11507.56
procedures and on you and before you

11505.6 --> 11511.359
know it you're like dying on a

11507.56 --> 11514.319
ventilator or something like no don't

11511.359 --> 11517.720000000001
consult a freaking physician with

11514.319 --> 11517.72
coughing issues are you

11536.16 --> 11539.16
nuts

11563.479 --> 11570.08
the [Â __Â ] is it ENT Clinic anyway don't

11566.84 --> 11570.08
even know what the hell that

11577.46 --> 11580.65
[Music]

11584.8 --> 11588.239
is oh

11588.399 --> 11594.56
right that's like a throat doctor right

11591.64 --> 11598.56
ENT that's the English version of

11594.56 --> 11601.399
it yeah I mean

11598.56 --> 11603.8
why I mean unless you have like really

11601.399 --> 11606.8
bizarre situations like oh you're

11603.8 --> 11608.88
coughing up blood or something like no

11606.8 --> 11613.479
why the [Â __Â ] would you go to a doctor

11608.88 --> 11613.479
with that I mean you're nuts if you do

11613.96 --> 11618.479
that hey seeking star water good to see

11626.04 --> 11629.04
you

11630.76 --> 11634.439
recola

11632.92 --> 11636.52
mins

11634.439 --> 11639.279
recola

11636.52 --> 11642.84
H wow there's some real herbal advice

11639.279 --> 11642.84
there from seeking star water sounds

11644.64 --> 11651.64
interesting that those things could work

11647.12 --> 11655.880000000001
too I mean we had some basic tips like

11651.64 --> 11659.439
just some honey and some vitamin

11655.88 --> 11663.56
C and and potentially if it's really

11659.439 --> 11667.04
agitated maybe some gargling with some

11663.56 --> 11668.84
magnesium dissolved in water might help

11667.04 --> 11670.84
but those things that you mentioned that

11668.84 --> 11673.84
maybe that would help as well I don't

11670.84 --> 11673.84
know could

11674.319 --> 11679.278999999999
be just a hair B okay

11686.04 --> 11689.04
clear

11691.479 --> 11695.599999999999
yeah vitamin C is just always going to

11693.399 --> 11695.599999999999
be

11696.2 --> 11703.319000000001
useful and if you're like in a in a

11699.319 --> 11706.119999999999
typical sickness cycle it's always going

11703.319 --> 11709.199999999999
to be helpful it's never going to not be

11706.12 --> 11713.0
helpful it always

11709.2 --> 11715.960000000001
is so that's why that's like a standard

11713.0 --> 11718.96
recommendation for

11715.96 --> 11718.96
me

11745.92 --> 11748.92
right

11752.439 --> 11756.12
I think I'm going to maneuver towards

11754.16 --> 11759.439
rounding out the show though guys it's

11756.12 --> 11759.439
been going over 3

11762.479 --> 11769.399
hours it's getting kind of

11765.56 --> 11769.399
late let me check the

11770.92 --> 11778.92
PayPal can really use

11775.92 --> 11778.92
donations

11784.0 --> 11787.8
especially if I want some really good

11788.199 --> 11794.880000000001
dinner cuz I've been living relatively

11791.239 --> 11797.439
with simple dinners

11794.88 --> 11799.72
recently hamburgers and I mean that's

11797.439 --> 11802.319
great I love it I love hamburgers but I

11799.72 --> 11803.84
just I should really like have like a a

11802.319 --> 11806.6
chicken

11803.84 --> 11809.359
vegetable stew thing again something

11806.6 --> 11812.359
more elaborate for the

11809.359 --> 11816.239

11822.279 --> 11828.76
fresh lettuce and everything but uh like

11825.439 --> 11831.84
I should really cook something more

11828.76 --> 11834.359
elaborate but that does like come with a

11831.84 --> 11838.84
price it's it is kind of

11834.359 --> 11838.84
pricey everything is pretty much

11840.92 --> 11844.439

12055.88 --> 12061.759999999998
Richard about the cats that really sucks

did that happen

12067.399 --> 12074.84
recently that no wonder you're a bit

12072.0 --> 12078.56
down this yeah it's terrible when when

12074.84 --> 12083.76
your cats die really

12078.56 --> 12083.76
sucks few years ago oh

12085.92 --> 12093.52
okay yeah I mean my

12089.319 --> 12096.72
cat which is really my cat like died in

12093.52 --> 12100.319000000001
2014 when I just had moved in here that

12096.72 --> 12102.84
was terrible on me because I was so

12100.319 --> 12104.359
close to that one like it was my

12102.84 --> 12108.52
familiar like we had like this

12104.359 --> 12108.52
telepathic connection

12112.239 --> 12118.439
really and yeah I really missed

12115.76 --> 12121.359
that and now the white cat that comes

12118.439 --> 12123.199
here is kind of getting close to that

12121.359 --> 12125.439
same

12123.199 --> 12128.84
level but I mean

12125.439 --> 12132.52
it yeah my old cat

12128.84 --> 12134.84
like it went beyond just emotional it

12132.52 --> 12137.12
was like a mental connection she had

12134.84 --> 12141.84
like human thinking

12137.12 --> 12141.84
in her head she was like that was

12143.08 --> 12149.0
amazing she was born like that she was

12145.479 --> 12151.64
always like weird with other cats she

12149.0 --> 12156.399
was like more human in

12151.64 --> 12156.399
ways then cat it was very

12158.8 --> 12161.8
strange

12165.439 --> 12168.439
what

12176.6 --> 12181.76
that cat riding a Harley what are you

12179.399 --> 12181.76

12182.16 --> 12185.8

12194.52 --> 12201.319000000001
then yeah my cat my old

12198.319 --> 12203.6
cat which died over 10 years ago I can't

12201.319 --> 12203.6
believe

12205.52 --> 12210.92
it like she was

12208.279 --> 12216.16
like the

12210.92 --> 12219.76
hostess she was like an Entertainer to

12216.16 --> 12222.039999999999
people like really a lot and like every

12219.76 --> 12225.239
time somebody came by she would always

12222.04 --> 12228.68
be there like hi I'm here like really as

12225.239 --> 12230.239
an Entertainer and she's like oh people

12228.68 --> 12233.800000000001
no it's like oh

12230.239 --> 12235.92
people and really like hi I'm here and

12233.8 --> 12238.96
she would like do her unique trick which

12235.92 --> 12240.399
is like in her family for some reason

12238.96 --> 12244.239
that they

12240.399 --> 12249.039999999999
would like her mother also did that like

12244.239 --> 12249.039999999999
stand on her back legs

12249.08 --> 12254.88
upright I have a photo of that it's

12251.479 --> 12257.72
amazing and like she would always do

12254.88 --> 12262.278999999999
that it's just

12257.72 --> 12262.278999999999
I've never seen other cats do

12265.12 --> 12271.239000000001
that it was really

12267.359 --> 12275.0
magical and like like nobody could

12271.239 --> 12276.399
witness that and not say a like there's

12275.0 --> 12281.0
no

12276.399 --> 12281.0
way it's like one of the cutest things

12284.399 --> 12290.96
ever I have the perfect pick picture of

12288.399 --> 12294.119999999999
that let me share that and then I'm

12290.96 --> 12294.119999999999
probably going to run out the

12297.439 --> 12301.960000000001
show right so here's my old

12303.04 --> 12308.160000000002
cat she

12304.88 --> 12313.839999999998
was probably

12308.16 --> 12313.84
like between six and 8 years old at this

12314.84 --> 12319.64
point and she would always just like

12317.08 --> 12321.12
greet people standing on their back legs

12319.64 --> 12324.92
like

12321.12 --> 12327.68
that and like not just for a second like

12324.92 --> 12329.52
stand like that for

12327.68 --> 12333.319
minutes and

12329.52 --> 12333.319000000001
just claw in

12333.479 --> 12338.64
midair like the type of purring clawing

12336.56 --> 12340.76
and she would just stand right up and do

12338.64 --> 12343.479
that midair it's like the the cutest

12340.76 --> 12343.479
thing you'd ever

12344.72 --> 12353.56
seen and wave with the Paw that is so

12349.56 --> 12353.56
awesome my cat didn't do

12357.12 --> 12362.76
that yeah and on top of that she was

12359.6 --> 12365.56
like super cuddly as

12362.76 --> 12368.52
well like really cuddly like you could

12365.56 --> 12368.519999999999
do anything with

12370.16 --> 12376.76
her the pet on the belly and everything

12373.279 --> 12378.439
and she'd never like bite or anything

12376.76 --> 12380.52
she would never like even get over

12378.439 --> 12383.800000000001
excited about that it was just

12380.52 --> 12388.399000000001
absolutely amazing C cute as a button

12383.8 --> 12388.399
indeed Gary fie I really miss

12397.04 --> 12402.76
her and she was also a hunter by the way

12400.6 --> 12405.279
like she was really well trained at

12402.76 --> 12408.239
hunting she would like go after mice

12405.279 --> 12408.239
after Birds

12408.359 --> 12411.640000000001
and was really good at

12415.68 --> 12423.439
it so she was not like oh just cute and

12420.399 --> 12428.56
weak and dumb no she was very

12423.439 --> 12428.56
smart very charismatic and very

12431.0 --> 12437.359
skilled and she had like you could just

12434.439 --> 12440.52
see that she was literally actively

12437.359 --> 12442.800000000001
trying to focus on people's minds trying

12440.52 --> 12446.08
to figure out how they were thinking you

12442.8 --> 12448.239
could see it in her like most cats like

12446.08 --> 12449.239
just don't give a [Â __Â ] they don't even

12448.239 --> 12451.84
like

12449.239 --> 12455.119999999999
recognize human intelligence at all

12451.84 --> 12458.8
they're like you're just a bunch of

12455.12 --> 12462.640000000001
animals let's see if you do what I

12458.8 --> 12464.679999999998
want but my cat like literally tried to

12462.64 --> 12468.439
like look you in the eyes and just try

12464.68 --> 12471.439
to figure out how it was working I mean

12468.439 --> 12474.52
that's very rare for cats to do

12471.439 --> 12479.16
that that they'll actually recognize

12474.52 --> 12479.16
humans as being a conscious being

12495.12 --> 12498.359
somehow

12496.72 --> 12501.519999999999
seeking that's a really cute seeking

12498.359 --> 12503.12
star you need to photograph that those

12501.52 --> 12507.16
are like precious

12503.12 --> 12511.68
things but yeah this that photo

12507.16 --> 12511.68
