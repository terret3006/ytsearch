99.2 --> 105.28
kind of broke already

102.64 --> 106.96000000000001
that's a bit of a shock because i hadn't

105.28 --> 110.159
really checked my bank account

106.96 --> 115.83999999999999
for a while just didn't want to

110.159 --> 115.84
let me get in my way

116.079 --> 121.439
but yeah i've bought

119.36 --> 123.119
quite a few supplements in the last

121.439 --> 126.63999999999999
month like to fill out

123.119 --> 129.84
everything that's been depleted in the

126.64 --> 129.84
last half year

130.0 --> 135.04
also we have got some things fixed got a

132.72 --> 137.84
new water cooker

135.04 --> 139.599
my jack is getting repaired my jacket is

137.84 --> 143.04
getting repaired so yeah

139.599 --> 143.92
unfortunately the big donation i had

143.04 --> 147.599
last month

143.92 --> 150.879
which was like a real blessing

147.599 --> 154.959
it is depleted

150.879 --> 160.319
so yeah i really need support again like

154.959 --> 160.31900000000002
right now if possible for anybody

160.959 --> 167.92000000000002
that can anyway

164.64 --> 171.83999999999997
the weather today is

167.92 --> 171.83999999999997
a little different

171.92 --> 175.67999999999998
it's a little bit more cloudy and

173.36 --> 179.20000000000002
there's a lot of haze up there

175.68 --> 182.4
i don't know if it's because of planes

179.2 --> 183.28
it doesn't really seem like that but

182.4 --> 184.87900000000002
yeah still

183.28 --> 187.44
very nice and sunny there's a lot of

184.879 --> 187.44
wind though

191.84 --> 198.84
so it's a little bit more of a breezy

194.319 --> 200.159
summer day

198.84 --> 201.18
[Music]

200.159 --> 208.039
still very nice

201.18 --> 208.03900000000002
[Music]

208.64 --> 217.44
all right so

212.239 --> 217.44
hello good servant first in chat agm

220.64 --> 230.319
it's saturday the 12th

225.68 --> 230.31900000000002
of june 2021

231.84 --> 234.72
how are you doing

239.04 --> 244.72
i made lasagna yesterday from the

242.08 --> 248.959
spaghetti sauce i had

244.72 --> 248.959
which was like really glorious

250.08 --> 254.799
but weirdly enough i have issues with my

253.92 --> 257.919
tooth again

254.799 --> 259.759
i don't know why some after thing

257.919 --> 262.0
it's kind of a no it's not really super

259.759 --> 263.44
painful but it is annoying again so

262.0 --> 266.24
yeah i thought that was completely

263.44 --> 267.919
through it apparently not

266.24 --> 270.96000000000004
weirdly enough makes me think that it

267.919 --> 270.96
might be the cheese

271.52 --> 274.4
it's really odd

278.479 --> 285.03999999999996
you were talking before i came on air

281.759 --> 285.04
i don't see that

292.639 --> 299.919
i mean i started up roughly

296.4 --> 301.19899999999996
eight past two comments appeared only

299.919 --> 302.96
after that so

301.199 --> 311.84000000000003
you might have been commenting before

302.96 --> 311.84
but i wasn't able to see that

317.52 --> 327.35999999999996
anyway yes welcome to this saturday show

324.08 --> 327.35999999999996
i feel a little tense

327.52 --> 330.88
well multiple reasons financial

329.919 --> 334.479
situation

330.88 --> 336.71999999999997
like ugh my little golden age month

334.479 --> 337.59999999999997
seems to be over and a bit bummed out by

336.72 --> 341.44000000000005
that

337.6 --> 346.32000000000005
i'm still like weirdly worrying

341.44 --> 349.6
just pondering on the back of my mind

346.32 --> 352.24
the whole waldorf school situation and

349.6 --> 353.03900000000004
like i went through so many things back

352.24 --> 356.56
then

353.039 --> 360.88
and suppressed a lot of it it was like

356.56 --> 363.52
like really conflicted too

360.88 --> 363.52
because yeah

365.44 --> 369.12
like emotionally that time was like

368.0 --> 371.919
really

369.12 --> 375.36
really rough on me it was also when i

371.919 --> 375.35999999999996
had like the biggest

375.44 --> 382.0
issues with bullying not just because of

379.6 --> 383.91900000000004
how they were but also because of how i

382.0 --> 386.0
was i had trouble with that already

383.919 --> 395.84
before that

386.0 --> 395.84
but this is weird

405.039 --> 410.88
right and yeah my tooth

409.28 --> 414.08
it's like i don't like it i thought it

410.88 --> 416.0
was completely over it and then it just

414.08 --> 418.479
it's not really bad but it might be like

416.0 --> 423.52
an after thing or whatever

418.479 --> 427.68
or it could be the cheese

423.52 --> 427.68
bullying a good subject oh god

428.08 --> 431.28
well the bullying that happened back

429.84 --> 434.79999999999995
then was basically

431.28 --> 437.039
them trying to play on my sense of honor

434.8 --> 439.52000000000004
and really abuse it that's what they did

437.039 --> 439.52
back then

442.88 --> 450.08
right because i was like super

446.8 --> 451.919
pro human it was kind of the same like i

450.08 --> 453.84
am now

451.919 --> 455.919
but at the same time like yeah some of

453.84 --> 457.84
them they really look down on me they

455.919 --> 460.15999999999997
thought i was a half breed and i just

457.84 --> 461.599
never really understood that

460.16 --> 465.84000000000003
because i always thought it was all

461.599 --> 465.84
about the spirit

470.8 --> 474.639
and yeah it didn't seem like they wanted

473.039 --> 476.479
to accept that

474.639 --> 478.0
my parents always said that it was

476.479 --> 482.08
because they were literally

478.0 --> 493.84
jealous of

482.08 --> 493.84
my spiritual purity of my refined senses

497.039 --> 500.479
just stress to think

504.319 --> 508.8
as it's just pressure sensitively again

509.68 --> 514.88
kind of like the last phase of after my

512.88 --> 516.8
jaw was really painful

514.88 --> 518.08
then it went away completely and now

516.8 --> 521.12
it's come back a little

518.08 --> 524.24
it's just

521.12 --> 527.44
annoying hey

524.24 --> 529.92
neil constantino and seeking star wars

527.44 --> 529.9200000000001
by the way

531.279 --> 534.64
hey sweet tooth yeah i've been watching

533.6 --> 537.279
that series too

534.64 --> 539.76
it's just one season though and i've

537.279 --> 543.279
yeah i finished it

539.76 --> 549.8389999999999
it's definitely gonna have a follow up

543.279 --> 549.8389999999999
because it really leaves you hanging

560.839 --> 563.839
so

607.12 --> 612.88
right anyway good to have you around the

610.72 --> 619.839
chat

612.88 --> 619.8389999999999
if you want to discuss something

620.24 --> 624.5600000000001
the things out there in the world right

622.32 --> 624.5600000000001
now

624.64 --> 627.519
things in the past

630.839 --> 633.839
esoterics

634.399 --> 647.839
things happening in relation to the flat

636.959 --> 647.8389999999999
earth debates

656.399 --> 662.48
try clothes you know it doesn't really

660.0 --> 662.48
help no

663.279 --> 666.16
cloak yeah that

668.24 --> 674.32
it might work a little the thing is

669.92 --> 677.279
though is that with cloves you know

674.32 --> 679.36
really there's a special type of pain

677.279 --> 682.56
that it works on really well

679.36 --> 683.2
it's more like over sensitivity or

682.56 --> 686.399
something

683.2 --> 689.12
but this is not it this is pressure

686.399 --> 691.12
right and it's not that bad so i i'm

689.12 --> 695.2
just gonna leave it alone

691.12 --> 698.24
right if medication

695.2 --> 701.519
attempts is really a last resort

698.24 --> 704.24
strategy for me right

701.519 --> 707.12
i'm just seeing it as an after wave

704.24 --> 707.12
healing attempt

708.88 --> 712.48
my son wants a youtube channel for his

711.839 --> 717.839
birthday

712.48 --> 717.839
what well

718.56 --> 731.8389999999999
how old is he and

721.839 --> 731.839
what does he want to do with it

741.279 --> 745.8389999999999
eleven oh that's it that's a little

743.6 --> 745.839
young

751.839 --> 756.0
for gaming okay

756.72 --> 760.639
well why would he want to do that on

758.32 --> 763.0400000000001
youtube there's like better platforms

760.639 --> 763.04
for that

764.88 --> 771.68
like d live and twitch those are

768.32 --> 773.7600000000001
kind of specifically made for games

771.68 --> 775.92
right so if he wants to do that given

773.76 --> 779.36
one of those

775.92 --> 779.36
you probably do better too

781.44 --> 792.8000000000001
what do you need equipment wise

787.6 --> 792.8000000000001
uh well

793.839 --> 801.839
a webcam a good microphone

798.24 --> 801.839
a good computer and

802.16 --> 806.16
yeah the right selection of software

806.8 --> 815.1999999999999
so i would recommend heat use obs

810.48 --> 818.88
works fine and

815.2 --> 818.88
yeah the rest is kind of up to him

821.199 --> 824.959
but you don't really need that much

826.399 --> 830.88
but he will kind of need at least a

828.56 --> 833.199
laptop or a better computer because

830.88 --> 834.56
like a desktop computer of some kind

833.199 --> 837.5999999999999
because a mobile phone

834.56 --> 840.8
is not really suitable

837.6 --> 842.8000000000001
like you can't really game on a phone

840.8 --> 845.279
and do a live stream with it at the same

842.8 --> 848.24
time like that's

845.279 --> 848.24
that's not doable

848.8 --> 851.199
all right

853.279 --> 856.8
is this the arwin i t show wait i'm open

856.399 --> 871.839
for

856.8 --> 871.8389999999999
any questions right

885.519 --> 888.9590000000001
yeti all right that's good

892.399 --> 897.04
but does he already have a laptop or a

894.8 --> 913.8389999999999
desktop computer

897.04 --> 913.8389999999999
that's kind of important

920.639 --> 927.839
is that a question to me hey jim

946.72 --> 950.9590000000001
yes okay well uh

953.44 --> 960.1600000000001
sometimes i do say prayers

956.48 --> 962.32
my own prayers at night especially when

960.16 --> 965.519
i feel like i need it

962.32 --> 966.48
most of the times i'm just i'm already

965.519 --> 968.72
there

966.48 --> 971.12
right prayer to me is to get me in the

968.72 --> 974.88
right frequencies

971.12 --> 976.24
right focus basically a reminder on an

974.88 --> 978.639
esoteric level

976.24 --> 981.199
that's what it is to me and i don't

978.639 --> 982.5600000000001
always actively do it sometimes i'm just

981.199 --> 985.68
like everything is alright

982.56 --> 985.68
and i just go to sleep

1000.88 --> 1013.279
oh yeah i missed you mandy you hello

1010.079 --> 1013.279
and george sanford

1022.839 --> 1025.839
now

1032.48 --> 1039.199
right so yeah for me

1036.24 --> 1039.839
the next week or one and a half week i

1039.199 --> 1043.039
guess

1039.839 --> 1043.4389999999999
could be really troublesome because i

1043.039 --> 1047.36
ran

1043.439 --> 1050.88
out of money it's kind of typical though

1047.36 --> 1053.1999999999998
that it would be for this time slot

1050.88 --> 1055.3600000000001
in the month typically happens between

1053.2 --> 1057.76
the 10th and the 20th

1055.36 --> 1057.76
for me

1058.72 --> 1064.16
but yeah it's going to depend on support

1061.919 --> 1065.76
i'm i'm going to be whining about it

1064.16 --> 1067.679
more than than i have

1065.76 --> 1069.52
i know you all got used to me barely

1067.679 --> 1070.64
mentioning it and i love that i didn't

1069.52 --> 1074.559
really need it to

1070.64 --> 1077.1200000000001
but i need to now right

1074.559 --> 1078.72
so how my performance is going to be is

1077.12 --> 1081.84
very much going to be dependent on how

1078.72 --> 1084.96
much support i'm gonna be getting

1081.84 --> 1084.9599999999998
in the next two weeks

1085.12 --> 1091.76
because i'm pretty much broke

1088.16 --> 1093.8400000000001
right now unexpectedly i thought it was

1091.76 --> 1094.24
gonna take longer i thought i was gonna

1093.84 --> 1109.84
last

1094.24 --> 1109.84
roughly another week but i was mistaken

1110.72 --> 1113.039
all right

1115.919 --> 1121.679
at least my debts are are gone

1119.039 --> 1123.28
like they've not grown back or anything

1121.679 --> 1127.679
thank god

1123.28 --> 1136.24
right but yeah i still have to

1127.679 --> 1140.0
buy food and such anyway uh

1136.24 --> 1145.52
you take time out spend your busy day

1140.0 --> 1145.52
spend with the lord well dude i

1145.94 --> 1149.16
[Music]

1149.28 --> 1157.2
i do my works in a way for the lord

1153.76 --> 1160.24
right my

1157.2 --> 1163.2
project what i do with my mind

1160.24 --> 1164.4
where i dwell with my mind figuring

1163.2 --> 1166.32
things out

1164.4 --> 1169.2800000000002
trying to figure things out from other

1166.32 --> 1172.24
people's perspective

1169.28 --> 1174.3999999999999
that's like to me sounds bizarre but

1172.24 --> 1178.48
it's kind of like a holy mission

1174.4 --> 1181.44
has been for a very long time even back

1178.48 --> 1181.44
30 years ago

1182.16 --> 1186.3200000000002
and i've kind of re-attained

1186.48 --> 1193.3600000000001
this serious level within it because

1190.16 --> 1196.4
like around 20 years ago i completely

1193.36 --> 1199.9189999999999
crumbled in my belief

1196.4 --> 1203.44
that anything could be done that i could

1199.919 --> 1206.72
actually do anything about anything

1203.44 --> 1207.1200000000001
i was really depressed like 20 years ago

1206.72 --> 1210.24
and

1207.12 --> 1211.4399999999998
like weirdly tried to reconstruct myself

1210.24 --> 1215.28
out of it

1211.44 --> 1219.039
but deluded in many ways

1215.28 --> 1222.0
and yeah gothicness attracted me

1219.039 --> 1224.0
and all yeah it's just really strange in

1222.0 --> 1226.799
retrospect

1224.0 --> 1229.76
but i have retained a lot of the

1226.799 --> 1232.96
original spirit i had

1229.76 --> 1234.799
also thanks to flat earth and the

1232.96 --> 1235.1200000000001
flatter scene and just the way people

1234.799 --> 1240.559
are

1235.12 --> 1240.559
here and their problems as well

1244.0 --> 1250.32
depressed in how i think well and how i

1247.28 --> 1250.32
felt especially

1253.039 --> 1260.32
i was just very demoralized

1256.88 --> 1264.3200000000002
like i needed to rest always

1260.32 --> 1268.24
on some kind of hope that that it's all

1264.32 --> 1271.12
good for something right

1268.24 --> 1272.24
and then one by one a whole bunch of

1271.12 --> 1275.52
groups in the world

1272.24 --> 1278.96
all disappointed me and they were all

1275.52 --> 1281.76
lacking like all of them no exception no

1278.96 --> 1281.76
exception

1283.52 --> 1289.039
but now so many years later having had

1286.88 --> 1291.1200000000001
time to let it all sink and try to put

1289.039 --> 1293.12
the pieces together

1291.12 --> 1294.3999999999999
my whole perspective it has become

1293.12 --> 1297.6
different and it's like

1294.4 --> 1301.52
no everything always gets

1297.6 --> 1301.52
a weakness it always just happens

1303.76 --> 1309.76
it's almost like they need a specific

1306.88 --> 1313.2
weakness that binds them

1309.76 --> 1315.76
with the weakness centers

1313.2 --> 1318.0800000000002
like is sort of a group sensation around

1315.76 --> 1320.48
the weakness

1318.08 --> 1321.12
and with it somewhere yeah like visceral

1320.48 --> 1325.28
loyalty

1321.12 --> 1325.28
it's so strange how this happens

1325.52 --> 1328.8799999999999
but every group has its weaknesses like

1327.679 --> 1333.8400000000001
its flaws and they

1328.88 --> 1333.8400000000001
become binded by that flaw

1338.48 --> 1342.559
so what i judge on is usually just the

1341.44 --> 1344.559
quality of

1342.559 --> 1346.24
loyalty and binding even if it is

1344.559 --> 1348.72
through weakness

1346.24 --> 1350.32
and overall personal critical thought

1348.72 --> 1352.64
strength

1350.32 --> 1355.52
the ability to find a way through and

1352.64 --> 1359.3600000000001
especially the willingness

1355.52 --> 1360.08
right that willingness to allow yourself

1359.36 --> 1362.9599999999998
to realize

1360.08 --> 1362.96
that you could

1364.159 --> 1372.0
there requires a certain belief in

1367.2 --> 1375.039
in absolute wisdom of the creator

1372.0 --> 1377.44
you have to believe that it exists you

1375.039 --> 1378.08
have to understand the purpose and it's

1377.44 --> 1380.0800000000002
also

1378.08 --> 1381.52
through the sensation of consciousness

1380.08 --> 1383.6
rising itself

1381.52 --> 1385.36
the more consciousness rises in a moment

1383.6 --> 1388.6399999999999
it's like the flame

1385.36 --> 1391.6789999999999
firing up i have by the way this really

1388.64 --> 1391.679
esoteric little

1394.159 --> 1399.1200000000001
thing that i even made in 2006 it's on

1397.12 --> 1402.2399999999998
my symbolic side about

1399.12 --> 1405.36
the four elements

1402.24 --> 1408.08
and how they tie in with

1405.36 --> 1409.36
being like how and in that fire is

1408.08 --> 1413.12
consciousness

1409.36 --> 1413.12
and water is the soul

1413.28 --> 1421.36
and air is the spirit and earth

1416.799 --> 1421.36
is the physical

1422.72 --> 1427.52
even back then i was still very

1425.039 --> 1430.0
fascinated by it all

1427.52 --> 1430.559
right but when the consciousness rises

1430.0 --> 1432.0
that's

1430.559 --> 1434.3999999999999
suddenly when the things when you're

1432.0 --> 1436.799
depressed depressed is

1434.4 --> 1438.96
never accompanied by high consciousness

1436.799 --> 1442.84
depression is almost a reaction to

1438.96 --> 1444.72
immediately pull you down in order to

1442.84 --> 1448.0
protect

1444.72 --> 1451.679
your core essence from the brightness

1448.0 --> 1454.08
of the enlightenment of ascension right

1451.679 --> 1456.0800000000002
so when you actually grow out of it then

1454.08 --> 1458.72
certainly all those things that you had

1456.08 --> 1459.279
interpreted as like no this is just a

1458.72 --> 1462.4
closed

1459.279 --> 1464.96
structure this is how it always

1462.4 --> 1467.1200000000001
comes together but when you ascend in

1464.96 --> 1468.64
consciousness then you suddenly start to

1467.12 --> 1471.6789999999999
see

1468.64 --> 1474.0
another depth to these types of things

1471.679 --> 1476.0800000000002
and then you realize how it is in a

1474.0 --> 1478.799
purpose how there is a development

1476.08 --> 1479.9189999999999
right but it really requires that top

1478.799 --> 1484.24
level

1479.919 --> 1487.1200000000001
flame in order to get a grip on that

1484.24 --> 1489.6
and then like worries and fears are

1487.12 --> 1491.4399999999998
neutralized within that perspective

1489.6 --> 1493.12
as soon as you drop out of it as soon as

1491.44 --> 1494.4
the flame dies down a little again you

1493.12 --> 1497.6
can't really hold on

1494.4 --> 1501.3600000000001
to it for that long because it burns

1497.6 --> 1506.7199999999998
up your spirit the air

1501.36 --> 1510.0
right you have to also grow spirit

1506.72 --> 1515.84
through your soul from the water

1510.0 --> 1515.84
and the earth

1526.84 --> 1530.799
uh

1528.48 --> 1532.88
right like in consciousness you have to

1530.799 --> 1536.32
be careful that

1532.88 --> 1538.24
the oversight is like a power on itself

1536.32 --> 1540.48
and if you're not careful you will burn

1538.24 --> 1543.52
up your entire spirit

1540.48 --> 1544.96
and then not step away from the high

1543.52 --> 1548.559
flame setting

1544.96 --> 1548.559
and then suddenly get a burnout

1548.88 --> 1552.5590000000002
right that's also how manic depression

1552.08 --> 1554.48
works

1552.559 --> 1557.039
manic depression the depression is

1554.48 --> 1561.919
usually a response to

1557.039 --> 1565.44
prolonged mania which is also the same

1561.919 --> 1567.1200000000001
modus in which

1565.44 --> 1568.64
you would attain typically a lot of

1567.12 --> 1570.799
consciousness

1568.64 --> 1573.039
and it is the consciousness that makes

1570.799 --> 1575.76
you maniacal sometimes

1573.039 --> 1578.08
that's and that is lucifer seducing you

1575.76 --> 1585.84
in that moment of power

1578.08 --> 1585.84
consciousness power it's yeah

1586.64 --> 1590.0800000000002
jesus christ died with the remission of

1588.96 --> 1592.559
our sins

1590.08 --> 1593.36
or he just lived and he showed how

1592.559 --> 1598.559
incredible

1593.36 --> 1603.76
human beings could be if they lived

1598.559 --> 1603.76
by the optimal design of the creator

1606.72 --> 1611.52
i don't think he had to die to

1609.52 --> 1627.84
accomplish anything i think that's

1611.52 --> 1627.84
i think that's a gravel

1634.64 --> 1641.8400000000001
what about buddha or what about him

1652.84 --> 1655.84
so

1668.399 --> 1671.12
oh by the way

1671.679 --> 1674.96
hello tony whitcomb

1676.799 --> 1686.399
nathan r how can we prove consciousness

1683.76 --> 1687.279
uh you can't you can only reflect upon

1686.399 --> 1692.8799999999999
consciousness

1687.279 --> 1692.88
and then size up who has more oversight

1693.84 --> 1697.84
which is kind of a linear development

1700.08 --> 1704.399
it requires consciousness to measure

1702.32 --> 1711.84
consciousness just like it requires

1704.399 --> 1711.84
knowledge of language to read language

1715.03 --> 1720.99
[Music]

1722.84 --> 1726.48
so

1724.559 --> 1727.6789999999999
waking up to the inceptions and lies

1726.48 --> 1730.72
improves your consciousness

1727.679 --> 1732.88
and your mind gets elevated

1730.72 --> 1734.72
sort of there is an opportunity for it's

1732.88 --> 1736.8400000000001
no guarantee though

1734.72 --> 1738.0
right so when you wake up to a lot of

1736.84 --> 1740.32
deceptions

1738.0 --> 1742.32
it's like these shackles that are on on

1740.32 --> 1743.9189999999999
you and basically decide where you can

1742.32 --> 1747.039
go and where you don't

1743.919 --> 1752.0
you trust it they get

1747.039 --> 1755.12
open up but

1752.0 --> 1758.48
that also hurts because

1755.12 --> 1760.32
your trusted pathways the railroad

1758.48 --> 1763.44
you've been used to going on

1760.32 --> 1763.4399999999998
they don't work anymore

1763.76 --> 1768.32
now unless all of them were all just

1766.32 --> 1772.24
punishing to you

1768.32 --> 1774.559
then yeah

1772.24 --> 1776.799
if they weren't then you might get

1774.559 --> 1780.6399999999999
nostalgia

1776.799 --> 1782.72
and it's actually very tough

1780.64 --> 1785.1200000000001
but it does provide an opportunity to

1782.72 --> 1787.919
basically

1785.12 --> 1789.4399999999998
transform the shackles having weighed on

1787.919 --> 1793.039
you

1789.44 --> 1793.6000000000001
to you three of them being stronger for

1793.039 --> 1796.0
it

1793.6 --> 1798.24
because of all the weight but you gotta

1796.0 --> 1801.44
choose to let the weight go

1798.24 --> 1809.84
first that's the greatest challenge

1801.44 --> 1813.279
within awaking

1809.84 --> 1815.6789999999999
what is my main focus in life is it

1813.279 --> 1815.679
fe

1817.44 --> 1823.8400000000001
or is it more of an interest hobby

1831.039 --> 1835.6
it is kind of more like an interest

1833.12 --> 1838.08
hobby

1835.6 --> 1840.7199999999998
but i'd still take it take a lot of

1838.08 --> 1840.72
pride in it

1842.399 --> 1848.799
but no i've never

1846.399 --> 1851.84
it's not like my mission to turn

1848.799 --> 1855.679
everybody into a flat earther

1851.84 --> 1858.799
my mission is to make people

1855.679 --> 1865.44
attempt to make people

1858.799 --> 1867.279
better from my perspective

1865.44 --> 1870.3990000000001
like i would made like i'm trying to

1867.279 --> 1870.399
make myself better

1870.72 --> 1878.24
and i think there's just a lot of

1874.96 --> 1880.24
room within the flat earth

1878.24 --> 1884.159
because there's so many people that are

1880.24 --> 1887.1200000000001
constantly struggling with their chains

1884.159 --> 1893.8400000000001
and i know a lot about it so i feel i

1887.12 --> 1893.84
just have a lot to offer here

1898.0 --> 1901.679
how do lunar eclipses work on the flat

1900.72 --> 1904.84
earth

1901.679 --> 1906.48
well you see the moon and light in the

1904.84 --> 1908.72
sky

1906.48 --> 1910.08
then suddenly a shadow goes over the

1908.72 --> 1911.84
moon

1910.08 --> 1913.279
or that's how you would describe it if

1911.84 --> 1913.9189999999999
you would assume it was a physical

1913.279 --> 1916.08
object

1913.919 --> 1918.7990000000002
so darkness goes over it and then it

1916.08 --> 1923.4399999999998
kind of like when it is fully over it

1918.799 --> 1923.44
it decreases a little then gets red

1923.76 --> 1926.799
it's all lights

1930.159 --> 1935.8400000000001
it's not really important what the shape

1932.799 --> 1935.84
of the earth is

1936.72 --> 1949.84
in relation to the lights sighting

1941.2 --> 1949.8400000000001
eos blaze

1982.88 --> 1986.88
the shadow of oh you assume it's a

1985.679 --> 1988.5590000000002
shadow then

1986.88 --> 1990.0
so you assume that the moon is a

1988.559 --> 1992.32
physical object and that

1990.0 --> 1993.84
light is being cast against an object in

1992.32 --> 1999.12
order to cause that

1993.84 --> 1999.12
shadow right that's a lot of assumptions

2002.84 --> 2005.84
just

2006.68 --> 2009.759
[Music]

2030.84 --> 2033.84
which

2044.84 --> 2047.84
so

2060.639 --> 2066.7200000000003
photon wave forms improve consciousness

2064.48 --> 2066.72
what

2068.159 --> 2075.839
a scientist claims this nathan are

2072.839 --> 2075.839
okay

2087.839 --> 2091.599
i'm sorry that you can't handle it but

2089.919 --> 2092.48
you have no proof that the moon is

2091.599 --> 2095.9190000000003
physical

2092.48 --> 2099.119
right i bet

2095.919 --> 2100.7999999999997
you have heard the claims from ballers

2099.119 --> 2104.7200000000003
the moon signal oh

2100.8 --> 2105.76
that mood signal well nobody actually

2104.72 --> 2108.0789999999997
does that

2105.76 --> 2109.3590000000004
right i've never seen a demonstration of

2108.079 --> 2112.7200000000003
that actually

2109.359 --> 2114.72
being done in a way that is in any sort

2112.72 --> 2116.9599999999996
of way convincing

2114.72 --> 2118.0
right there's videos out there where you

2116.96 --> 2121.04
just get to look

2118.0 --> 2123.839
oh look we have a computer

2121.04 --> 2126.56
it's sending a signal to the moon and it

2123.839 --> 2128.96
is being received because we say so

2126.56 --> 2130.96
look at the screen this is supposed to

2128.96 --> 2136.56
mean that it's being received

2130.96 --> 2139.119
right complete garbage no actual

2136.56 --> 2139.7599999999998
kind of evidence that there's anything

2139.119 --> 2142.2400000000002
happening

2139.76 --> 2143.119
and i've suggested already like what you

2142.24 --> 2146.24
could do

2143.119 --> 2146.56
to actually prove a moon signal rebounds

2146.24 --> 2149.7599999999998
that

2146.56 --> 2149.7599999999998
is a possibility right

2150.0 --> 2157.44
you take three cameras

2154.0 --> 2158.88
three very specific in a singular video

2157.44 --> 2161.68
shot

2158.88 --> 2163.28
to edit it together synchronize they all

2161.68 --> 2167.5989999999997
run at the same time

2163.28 --> 2172.32
right one video camera is attached

2167.599 --> 2175.6800000000003
to a radio transmitter

2172.32 --> 2178.1600000000003
the thing that you could aim right

2175.68 --> 2179.44
it's got to be right on top of it so

2178.16 --> 2181.7599999999998
when you aim it you can

2179.44 --> 2184.88
see where it's aiming live right so you

2181.76 --> 2187.76
can aim the transmitter at the moon

2184.88 --> 2190.48
right then you have a camera that's on

2187.76 --> 2194.8
the computer screen that gives a direct

2190.48 --> 2198.839
signal receive non-receive

2194.8 --> 2202.4
readout so you can literally test it

2198.839 --> 2205.04
live it's pointed at something

2202.4 --> 2206.32
there's a signal feedback not pointed uh

2205.04 --> 2208.72
there's no feedback

2206.32 --> 2210.56
right so you can point it at the moon it

2208.72 --> 2213.52
goes up

2210.56 --> 2215.52
you point it away from when it goes down

2213.52 --> 2217.7599999999998
up down up down up down

2215.52 --> 2219.7599999999998
like that right and then you have the

2217.76 --> 2223.0400000000004
third camera

2219.76 --> 2226.7200000000003
that's on the scenario from a distance

2223.04 --> 2229.839
filming both things computer screen the

2226.72 --> 2229.839
person holding

2230.32 --> 2237.599
the transmitter so it's all in one live

2234.079 --> 2240.96
shot now that way you could prove to me

2237.599 --> 2243.6800000000003
sufficient sufficiently that you can

2240.96 --> 2245.119
actually send a signal to it and it will

2243.68 --> 2248.16
rebound

2245.119 --> 2251.839
right anything else

2248.16 --> 2255.1189999999997
is complete horseshit anything

2251.839 --> 2257.839
else anything else right

2255.119 --> 2259.599
and you got to do it in the open you got

2257.839 --> 2260.88
to do it in open air not in some

2259.599 --> 2265.3590000000004
freaking special

2260.88 --> 2265.359
building right

2266.4 --> 2273.52
it's got to be outside

2270.0 --> 2274.32
now if you do that then well then we can

2273.52 --> 2277.119
continue

2274.32 --> 2278.8
the speculation on how the moon might be

2277.119 --> 2281.6800000000003
physical in some sort of way

2278.8 --> 2284.2400000000002
but before that time it's purely light

2281.68 --> 2287.839
and light alone

2284.24 --> 2289.7599999999998
if no foundation to draw in

2287.839 --> 2292.4
an assumption that it is a physical

2289.76 --> 2295.5200000000004
object there's no proof of it

2292.4 --> 2298.0
so angular size change with approach

2295.52 --> 2299.68
right you go towards it it grows bigger

2298.0 --> 2302.48
that doesn't happen with the moon

2299.68 --> 2304.0789999999997
ever and it is supposed to be pretty

2302.48 --> 2306.0
close by so if with

2304.079 --> 2308.1600000000003
anything that should be possible it

2306.0 --> 2310.32
would be the moon

2308.16 --> 2312.0789999999997
right and then there is like the

2310.32 --> 2314.0
confirmation it's physical well if it's

2312.079 --> 2315.92
physical it's gonna have to rebound some

2314.0 --> 2317.599
kind of a signal that's even officially

2315.92 --> 2321.359
claimed so demonstrate it

2317.599 --> 2323.3590000000004
in the exact setup that i proposed

2321.359 --> 2327.839
i've dedicated an entire show to this

2323.359 --> 2327.839
like a year ago or two

2329.44 --> 2336.8
oh yes oh so

2333.2 --> 2336.7999999999997
you're just going to be triggered

2338.0 --> 2344.48
you're not actually going to dig

2341.28 --> 2349.92
into the valid response that i gave

2344.48 --> 2349.92
your claim right that i gave to you

2352.839 --> 2359.44
right you're just saying no we're idiots

2356.72 --> 2359.9199999999996
i am an idiot arwin is stupid because i

2359.44 --> 2362.2400000000002
don't

2359.92 --> 2364.4
assume the moon is a physical object

2362.24 --> 2367.9199999999996
right even though i've already explained

2364.4 --> 2368.2400000000002
why i don't think it's a physical object

2367.92 --> 2372.7200000000003
and

2368.24 --> 2375.1189999999997
tests that we could do ourselves

2372.72 --> 2378.8799999999997
in order to actually demonstrate that it

2375.119 --> 2384.48
has some sort of physical nature to it

2378.88 --> 2387.04
right i'm sorry if you can't handle that

2384.48 --> 2388.56
right i am okay with if the moon turns

2387.04 --> 2391.04
out to be physical that would be

2388.56 --> 2392.24
fascinating that would be very

2391.04 --> 2395.839
interesting

2392.24 --> 2399.1189999999997
unfortunately though despite that wonder

2395.839 --> 2400.16
that wonderment it doesn't seem that it

2399.119 --> 2401.92
is physical

2400.16 --> 2403.2799999999997
because i haven't seen the proper

2401.92 --> 2411.839
demonstration to

2403.28 --> 2411.8390000000004
give us those clues that it is

2420.48 --> 2424.0
all right well you're projecting now yes

2422.88 --> 2427.04
i'm really sorry

2424.0 --> 2427.04
you can't handle

2427.28 --> 2434.079
real serious inquiry into these things

2430.48 --> 2436.96
i'm not here to virtue signal

2434.079 --> 2438.079
your religious convictions because

2436.96 --> 2441.04
that's when everybody

2438.079 --> 2441.52
keeps parroting i'm not gonna do it i'm

2441.04 --> 2444.64
sorry

2441.52 --> 2446.319
i'm sorry you feel the need to shame me

2444.64 --> 2449.839
for that

2446.319 --> 2449.839
but i don't really care

2450.079 --> 2467.8390000000004
and i'm not gonna be triggered over you

2452.079 --> 2467.8390000000004
doing that either

2478.839 --> 2481.839
ah

2492.96 --> 2499.359
i mean just have you ever thought about

2496.96 --> 2502.0
actually trying to empirically figure

2499.359 --> 2504.64
out what is true and what is it

2502.0 --> 2505.2
did you ever come up with hey how can we

2504.64 --> 2509.839
test

2505.2 --> 2509.839
whether the moon is physical right

2534.839 --> 2537.839
so

2547.359 --> 2554.7999999999997
oh really how

2550.96 --> 2556.96
oh wow we we got we got a

2554.8 --> 2558.4
self-imposed winner here somebody

2556.96 --> 2561.52
actually

2558.4 --> 2565.76
doesn't know what's going down how did

2561.52 --> 2568.319
you come across my hangout josh

2565.76 --> 2568.96
because at this point either you are a

2568.319 --> 2572.319
blatant

2568.96 --> 2574.48
baller troll like all of those out there

2572.319 --> 2577.2
hanging around in this corner squirting

2574.48 --> 2580.64
all day over their fantasies

2577.2 --> 2581.2
ignoring evidence or you're an outsider

2580.64 --> 2583.2799999999997
that

2581.2 --> 2584.7999999999997
doesn't actually know anything about

2583.28 --> 2587.119
flat earth

2584.8 --> 2588.4
it's only recently dropped in and then

2587.119 --> 2592.2400000000002
you have no

2588.4 --> 2595.92
idea how things go down

2592.24 --> 2595.9199999999996
so which one is it yes

2598.8 --> 2608.4
how did you get to this hangout

2606.0 --> 2612.319
have you ever listened to the flat earth

2608.4 --> 2612.319
debate show from nathan oakley

2618.72 --> 2621.839
possible with the circling sun over a

2621.04 --> 2626.079
flat earth

2621.839 --> 2629.839
oh you mean a physical

2626.079 --> 2632.6400000000003
literal positioned sun lamp

2629.839 --> 2633.359
hovering over a disk do you is is that

2632.64 --> 2637.44
what you

2633.359 --> 2640.319
mean that's impossible

2637.44 --> 2640.319
right well

2640.8 --> 2650.079
perhaps not everybody is claiming that

2646.839 --> 2652.64
right like me

2650.079 --> 2656.319
i don't clean that i don't even think

2652.64 --> 2656.319
the earth is literally a disk

2656.64 --> 2663.359
right i don't think the sun

2659.68 --> 2666.72
is in any position hovering

2663.359 --> 2671.52
no it's a purely holographic

2666.72 --> 2675.1189999999997
light-based only phenomenon

2671.52 --> 2678.319
that appears at the edge of a vision

2675.119 --> 2680.6400000000003
any vision depending on its diffraction

2678.319 --> 2683.839
limit and all those factors it's a

2680.64 --> 2686.64
optical only phenomena that's why i call

2683.839 --> 2688.16
it holographic an image of light

2686.64 --> 2690.0789999999997
see at the edge of vision and it

2688.16 --> 2693.52
presents all of the celestial

2690.079 --> 2696.4
sun moon planets stars all the things

2693.52 --> 2696.4
shooting stars

2696.64 --> 2704.24
weird infrared wobbly lights and also go

2700.64 --> 2706.7999999999997
go around it's all holographic it's all

2704.24 --> 2709.359
presenting itself at the edge of vision

2706.8 --> 2713.28
as a demisphere

2709.359 --> 2716.0
to the observer whatever the observer is

2713.28 --> 2719.8390000000004
it's not actually physically present

2716.0 --> 2719.839
anywhere there's no evidence for this

2726.64 --> 2732.7999999999997
now you saw so many stupid well then

2729.44 --> 2734.48
you've been dwelling on the control

2732.8 --> 2736.0
opposition garbage

2734.48 --> 2738.4
right there's a lot of people out there

2736.0 --> 2741.359
that literally are there

2738.4 --> 2742.96
acting like [ __ ] flat earthers to

2741.359 --> 2745.92
satisfy a market of

2742.96 --> 2746.8
squirting globe believers that can't

2745.92 --> 2749.599
handle

2746.8 --> 2751.599
that they might be wrong there's entire

2749.599 --> 2752.96
channels dedicated to this [ __ ] and

2751.599 --> 2756.0
heavily sponsored

2752.96 --> 2758.16
people being like the earth is flat oh

2756.0 --> 2760.72
look at water in the bowl

2758.16 --> 2762.3999999999996
they bring out the dumbest arguments

2760.72 --> 2765.4399999999996
that have ever been made

2762.4 --> 2768.0
put it together to put down an act of a

2765.44 --> 2769.76
[ __ ] flat earther

2768.0 --> 2773.04
they do that there's videos out there

2769.76 --> 2774.48
they have been out there for years now

2773.04 --> 2776.079
a lot of them now if you've been

2774.48 --> 2779.44
dwelling on that

2776.079 --> 2782.319
that must mean that actual flat earthers

2779.44 --> 2783.839
frighten you because actual flat

2782.319 --> 2787.52
earthers that have been around for

2783.839 --> 2791.04
years like me doing this every day

2787.52 --> 2794.4
life every day for years now

2791.04 --> 2795.52
yeah we are not like those controlled

2794.4 --> 2798.64
opposition

2795.52 --> 2801.7599999999998
fake flat earther [ __ ] actors

2798.64 --> 2804.16
yeah we're actual flat earthers

2801.76 --> 2806.2400000000002
we actually study this we dedicate a

2804.16 --> 2807.04
great portion of our life to figuring

2806.24 --> 2810.72
this out

2807.04 --> 2813.119
it's a continual mission and to figure

2810.72 --> 2813.7599999999998
out the psychological warfare operations

2813.119 --> 2815.6800000000003
as well

2813.76 --> 2818.2400000000002
going around in the world and among

2815.68 --> 2818.24
globers

2818.319 --> 2821.92
yeah learning all kinds of things here

2820.96 --> 2824.16
so

2821.92 --> 2824.96
you might just want to drop watching the

2824.16 --> 2828.72
flat earth

2824.96 --> 2832.96
[ __ ] fake channels

2828.72 --> 2834.9599999999996
that talk literal nonsense all the time

2832.96 --> 2837.04
and go to channels that actually have

2834.96 --> 2840.079
interesting things to say

2837.04 --> 2841.92
because we do flat earth debates is very

2840.079 --> 2844.559
interesting

2841.92 --> 2846.559
i think i'm very interesting not always

2844.559 --> 2846.96
i can be a little bit boring or whatever

2846.559 --> 2850.0
or

2846.96 --> 2852.16
weird mood it but technically

2850.0 --> 2853.839
what i have to say is interesting i'm

2852.16 --> 2858.48
proud of what i know

2853.839 --> 2861.04
and how how i can explain it

2858.48 --> 2862.72
so you might want to reconsider your

2861.04 --> 2865.119
position

2862.72 --> 2865.1189999999997
yes

2868.079 --> 2871.3590000000004
get actually actually get scientific

2870.4 --> 2873.76
with it

2871.359 --> 2875.119
and that means first understanding what

2873.76 --> 2878.3190000000004
science is

2875.119 --> 2878.7200000000003
that's an empirical method and it's not

2878.319 --> 2882.96
as

2878.72 --> 2885.2799999999997
easy and everybody can do it

2882.96 --> 2887.52
as it's been put out culturally in the

2885.28 --> 2890.559
world because it's not that easy

2887.52 --> 2893.28
yes technically anyone can do it but you

2890.559 --> 2896.559
have to know what you're doing

2893.28 --> 2897.52
in order to do it it requires a certain

2896.559 --> 2899.8390000000004
level of

2897.52 --> 2901.52
inquiry and a certain level of oversight

2899.839 --> 2903.7599999999998
and curiosity

2901.52 --> 2905.2
understanding critical thinking if you

2903.76 --> 2907.44
don't have any of that then

2905.2 --> 2909.04
you would be thinking you're applying

2907.44 --> 2910.64
science but you're not actually doing

2909.04 --> 2912.72
that at all

2910.64 --> 2913.7599999999998
but you're okay and other people might

2912.72 --> 2915.5989999999997
be okay with just

2913.76 --> 2917.28
calling it science even though it

2915.599 --> 2918.559
technically doesn't have anything to do

2917.28 --> 2921.92
with it

2918.559 --> 2921.92
it's a cultural issue

2927.52 --> 2934.079
okay oh dude go [ __ ] yourself then

2931.68 --> 2934.0789999999997
bye

2936.24 --> 2940.8799999999997
crouchie wanker you don't need to be

2940.0 --> 2943.04
leaving

2940.88 --> 2944.559
i'm banning you piece of [ __ ] go [ __ ]

2943.04 --> 2949.2
yourself

2944.559 --> 2952.96
yeah go go guzzle down some more balls

2949.2 --> 2952.96
yeah go go ahead bye

2953.52 --> 2956.96
right i'm not even doing this for you

2956.319 --> 2958.88
right

2956.96 --> 2960.079
i'm just giving you an opportunity

2958.88 --> 2962.079
because that's

2960.079 --> 2964.079
what i'm supposed to do and i'm doing it

2962.079 --> 2967.44
to the best of my ability now if

2964.079 --> 2968.88
you're just gonna be a complete [ __ ]

2967.44 --> 2971.76
piece of [ __ ] over it

2968.88 --> 2974.079
instead then it's your problem i did

2971.76 --> 2978.079
what i could

2974.079 --> 2982.559
i don't need you as a follower

2978.079 --> 2986.88
josh lace i don't care i only care

2982.559 --> 2988.6400000000003
that i could potentially help you

2986.88 --> 2990.1600000000003
enlightening you about certain things

2988.64 --> 2992.96
now if you can't handle this then you

2990.16 --> 2994.8799999999997
can just get the [ __ ] up

2992.96 --> 2997.28
and make room for people that actually

2994.88 --> 2997.28
matter

3007.2 --> 3013.839
hello geomatria effect news

3022.559 --> 3029.0400000000004
holy [ __ ] did an hour just go by already

3026.319 --> 3029.04
that was quick

3035.68 --> 3041.1189999999997
well i'll keep it going for a while

3039.04 --> 3043.359
just feels like only 50 minutes have

3041.119 --> 3043.359
passed

3046.4 --> 3050.48
nice hair yeah i like my hair that's

3052.839 --> 3055.839
right

3081.44 --> 3083.839
all right

3086.88 --> 3097.04
so hey anybody else want to deliver

3090.559 --> 3099.92
some angle of approach as to evidence

3097.04 --> 3101.44
that anything about the heavenly

3099.92 --> 3104.16
sightings

3101.44 --> 3104.16
are physical

3104.64 --> 3108.5589999999997
right i thought i did pretty good i'm

3107.44 --> 3112.4
really proud of my

3108.559 --> 3114.0
original inquiry about how to establish

3112.4 --> 3115.52
physicality of the moon based on the

3114.0 --> 3117.52
moon signal right

3115.52 --> 3119.599
abolish would just be throwing that in

3117.52 --> 3120.88
my face and like look at this video yeah

3119.599 --> 3124.2400000000002
there is a screen

3120.88 --> 3125.52
they say there is a moon bounce signal

3124.24 --> 3127.2
even though you don't even see any

3125.52 --> 3129.839
variation going on

3127.2 --> 3131.16
life it's just a picture it's really

3129.839 --> 3135.359
stupid and i'm just

3131.16 --> 3136.96
embarrassed from my baldwin perspective

3135.359 --> 3140.0789999999997
i'm embarrassed

3136.96 --> 3140.079
how stupid they are

3150.16 --> 3155.04
a sec i don't know who that is good

3152.64 --> 3155.04
servant

3158.24 --> 3161.359
exactly

3159.06 --> 3163.359
[Music]

3161.359 --> 3167.839
who's that is that supposed to be

3163.359 --> 3167.839
somebody special

3185.28 --> 3195.8390000000004
okay you got a book

3188.4 --> 3195.839
i guess

3197.119 --> 3209.839
i don't think you're the only one called

3198.96 --> 3209.839
that though but whatever

3216.72 --> 3237.839
[Music]

3219.119 --> 3237.839
it's not zack okay you say sorry

3238.24 --> 3241.1189999999997
really does that

3248.559 --> 3251.8390000000004
all right

3266.72 --> 3273.52
all right but yeah uh zachary

3270.4 --> 3276.2400000000002
i'm not a particular fan of geomatria

3273.52 --> 3278.16
as in at all i'm not saying like who

3276.24 --> 3281.1189999999997
gematria bad it's just like

3278.16 --> 3282.16
it's not my thing at all i don't like it

3281.119 --> 3284.88
at all

3282.16 --> 3286.96
i think it's a distraction from my

3284.88 --> 3293.839
better skills

3286.96 --> 3293.839
so always avoid and even math in general

3305.119 --> 3310.319
but hey if you're really good at it it's

3307.2 --> 3312.799
just like astrology and such things

3310.319 --> 3314.72
right if you really got a good grip on

3312.799 --> 3316.48
it then yeah i'm sure you'd be able to

3314.72 --> 3318.0789999999997
do all kinds of things with it right

3316.48 --> 3319.68
some people are really good with

3318.079 --> 3322.319
gematria

3319.68 --> 3323.839
others are just ranting number obsessed

3322.319 --> 3326.16
freaks

3323.839 --> 3327.119
that are just spouting nonsense all day

3326.16 --> 3330.0789999999997
long right so

3327.119 --> 3335.839
it depends on the individual i'm not a

3330.079 --> 3335.8390000000004
big fan of it

3346.839 --> 3354.0789999999997
what derek really that's hilarious

3351.28 --> 3356.6400000000003
nasa actually used the word sun disk and

3354.079 --> 3356.6400000000003
moon disk

3360.64 --> 3365.7599999999998
i need to watch russian vids why why

3363.52 --> 3368.0
would i need to do that

3365.76 --> 3370.0
i know who russian vids is why would i

3368.0 --> 3371.839
need to watch him

3370.0 --> 3374.16
i know he's been around for a long time

3371.839 --> 3378.16
he was one of the first also bringing

3374.16 --> 3380.8799999999997
up trees on flat earth

3378.16 --> 3380.8799999999997
as it became

3381.359 --> 3383.839
back then

3384.4 --> 3391.839
i know who he is

3396.0 --> 3401.04
he's excellent okay it's not really my

3402.839 --> 3405.839
thing

3416.839 --> 3421.839
so

3419.44 --> 3425.2000000000003
it's actually been very long since i

3421.839 --> 3425.2
last watched anything of him

3426.72 --> 3431.1189999999997
but usually when that is i kind of

3428.72 --> 3433.68
forget the original reasons why

3431.119 --> 3434.7200000000003
and then if i would watch it again i'd

3433.68 --> 3437.5989999999997
be reminded

3434.72 --> 3439.4399999999996
why usually because when i completely

3437.599 --> 3443.04
just stop watching somebody even though

3439.44 --> 3446.16
i don't i'm not hostile or anything

3443.04 --> 3449.92
it's for good reasons

3446.16 --> 3452.5589999999997
i'm i'm a very yeah purist

3449.92 --> 3453.6800000000003
some things are just wrong i just don't

3452.559 --> 3457.76
want to be

3453.68 --> 3457.7599999999998
having that rubbing off on me at all

3458.559 --> 3463.76
oh yeah see you later steve traveler

3460.72 --> 3463.7599999999998
thanks for being a chat

3465.68 --> 3473.359
okay you're definitely

3469.599 --> 3476.4
definitely not zachary

3473.359 --> 3476.4
that's ridiculous

3484.0 --> 3489.52
like seriously how can i be against i

3487.44 --> 3491.44
freaking hate gangsters by the way i

3489.52 --> 3494.88
really do

3491.44 --> 3498.079
i'm not a gang barely have any friends

3494.88 --> 3502.1600000000003
circle around me physically

3498.079 --> 3506.0
i'm extremely lawful

3502.16 --> 3506.0
actual law natural law

3506.559 --> 3510.4
i'm god-fearing

3511.119 --> 3518.0
i'm not criminal i'm very

3514.72 --> 3521.9199999999996
very much a purist against criminality

3518.0 --> 3521.92
i don't like drug dealers

3522.319 --> 3528.4
like if cannabis and alcohol were legal

3525.92 --> 3531.2000000000003
i wouldn't even be using them yeah i'm

3528.4 --> 3535.2000000000003
that much of a goody two-shoe

3531.2 --> 3537.68
yeah i am anything but a freaking

3535.2 --> 3537.68
gangster

3542.839 --> 3545.839
ridiculous

3559.04 --> 3562.88
rv truths i've heard of them i don't

3561.119 --> 3564.96
know

3562.88 --> 3566.88
man tara there's so many freaking

3564.96 --> 3570.4
channels

3566.88 --> 3572.48
it's crazy and there's a lot more people

3570.4 --> 3575.119
a lot better at like

3572.48 --> 3577.04
having oversight over hundreds of people

3575.119 --> 3578.079
like patricia steer was pretty good at

3577.04 --> 3581.92
it

3578.079 --> 3581.92
i'm not good at it this is

3582.559 --> 3589.8390000000004
i typically am very tough

3586.559 --> 3594.6400000000003
i find it tough to find a good entry

3589.839 --> 3594.64
of interest in things and people

3594.96 --> 3601.839
harvey truth is russian vids okay

3598.48 --> 3601.839
i didn't know that

3604.559 --> 3611.92
all right rv rushing fits truth okay

3607.76 --> 3611.92
okay i didn't even know that

3613.52 --> 3629.839
but again i don't really follow his work

3648.079 --> 3651.599
right oh yeah i forgot about that part

3650.079 --> 3655.599
seeking star wars yeah

3651.599 --> 3658.0
they have money i i literally today

3655.599 --> 3660.319
shared that i was broke again and i need

3658.0 --> 3663.119
your paypal support

3660.319 --> 3664.88
in order to remain fed yeah so that part

3663.119 --> 3671.839
as well yeah i'm pretty much an

3664.88 --> 3671.839
anti-gangster every front

3679.76 --> 3684.6400000000003
what is this dream bottom besides flat

3682.079 --> 3686.799
earth oh so much

3684.64 --> 3690.48
that means many things just look in the

3686.799 --> 3694.24
description box and there's a whole list

3690.48 --> 3694.2400000000002
of hashtags of things

3696.839 --> 3703.2799999999997
that yeah

3699.599 --> 3713.839
that i involve myself with

3703.28 --> 3713.8390000000004
relevant words

3724.839 --> 3727.839
okay

3730.96 --> 3735.68
my shadow bends i

3736.0 --> 3743.2
probably i wouldn't know

3740.079 --> 3747.039
i've been doing this this channel this

3743.2 --> 3749.839
specific channel for over four years

3747.039 --> 3751.8390000000004
thinking five years now i don't know for

3749.839 --> 3754.88
a very long time

3751.839 --> 3756.799
and i've never been banned

3754.88 --> 3758.6400000000003
never had my channel taken down or

3756.799 --> 3762.079
anything

3758.64 --> 3765.0389999999998
even though yeah i have pretty much

3762.079 --> 3767.2000000000003
gone into all kinds of directions that i

3765.039 --> 3770.559
think normally

3767.2 --> 3772.799
would get banned

3770.559 --> 3775.119
so i've been able to somehow avoid a lot

3772.799 --> 3775.119
of that

3777.28 --> 3780.8390000000004
but at the same time i'm pretty certain

3779.76 --> 3783.5200000000004
there's

3780.839 --> 3786.96
just

3783.52 --> 3789.119
they've got like a special program

3786.96 --> 3790.319
throughout youtube for my channel that

3789.119 --> 3793.52
they don't just

3790.319 --> 3795.599
advertise me everywhere

3793.52 --> 3797.359
it's only a handful of people seem to

3795.599 --> 3800.799
really find me and all of them

3797.359 --> 3804.0
through nathan oakley show he has a

3800.799 --> 3807.839
little bit more of a reach

3804.0 --> 3810.0
so yeah my channel's reach is definitely

3807.839 --> 3812.4
very much contained

3810.0 --> 3814.4
oh yeah and then still at the same

3812.4 --> 3818.1600000000003
number of subscribers now

3814.4 --> 3822.319
for over a year

3818.16 --> 3825.839
okay for over a year

3822.319 --> 3825.839
i got 1.9

3827.359 --> 3834.64
yeah even though i have a every

3830.72 --> 3838.16
day show every day every single day

3834.64 --> 3840.96
every day so yeah you you tell me how

3838.16 --> 3840.96
that's logical

3842.4 --> 3846.88
right every day

3847.92 --> 3851.039
no exception unless i'm like sick or

3850.24 --> 3853.359
something or

3851.039 --> 3856.079
yeah it's very rarely that i even don't

3853.359 --> 3859.2
have a show even when i'm sick

3856.079 --> 3862.4
i always talk about something

3859.2 --> 3866.24
and i am persistent and inconsistent

3862.4 --> 3869.2000000000003
i have certain type of ideas that

3866.24 --> 3870.5589999999997
have been echoing from the start been

3869.2 --> 3873.839
building

3870.559 --> 3876.88
yep i have 1.92

3873.839 --> 3880.16
subscribers 1.92k

3876.88 --> 3883.599
that's it for a year so

3880.16 --> 3885.839
yeah is that normal even though like

3883.599 --> 3886.6400000000003
pretty much weekly new people will roll

3885.839 --> 3888.96
in

3886.64 --> 3889.92
and they even say they're subscribing

3888.96 --> 3892.079
that they just got

3889.92 --> 3894.319
like yeah they're subscribing to this

3892.079 --> 3897.76
well how did i

3894.319 --> 3899.7599999999998
how am i staying for a year

3897.76 --> 3902.079
on the same amount of subscribers you

3899.76 --> 3906.0
tell me how that works

3902.079 --> 3908.48
how that's not containing my channel

3906.0 --> 3909.76
right i don't get banned or anything i'm

3908.48 --> 3913.039
glad of that and i

3909.76 --> 3913.039
don't try to push that

3913.52 --> 3917.119
i'm not trying to be noisy yelly and all

3916.24 --> 3920.0789999999997
that

3917.119 --> 3920.079
attention grabby

3920.24 --> 3927.839
but still like this is not normal

3924.16 --> 3931.359
for this amount of hours i've put into

3927.839 --> 3934.0
my activities here this is

3931.359 --> 3935.0389999999998
insane it's like literally like they

3934.0 --> 3939.2
just

3935.039 --> 3941.6800000000003
cut me up cut me out of the spreading

3939.2 --> 3941.68
circuit

two days i think more perhaps

4042.72 --> 4049.839

4052.64 --> 4059.2
what now my jaw will

4056.96 --> 4059.2
uh

4060.319 --> 4068.799
well now that you're mentioning it

4063.76 --> 4077.5200000000004
a little yeah

4068.799 --> 4080.319
that's yeah i guess so

4077.52 --> 4080.319
it's kind of weird

4082.559 --> 4085.8390000000004
but it is again it is a big weight off

4084.559 --> 4088.96
my shoulder

4085.839 --> 4091.839
because i don't like doing this part

4088.96 --> 4091.839
but i have to

4092.319 --> 4108.48
attention yeah

4104.4 --> 4111.5199999999995
terribly sad no no no i'm not sad

4108.48 --> 4111.5199999999995
i'm not sad at all

4115.679 --> 4119.679
all of life is a challenge and wherever

4117.92 --> 4122.719
you think you're comfortable

4119.679 --> 4126.2390000000005
you will still be challenged and i'm in

4122.719 --> 4126.2390000000005
a kind of a weird position

4129.44 --> 4133.44
and i am doing what i like but i'm still

4132.96 --> 4136.88
being

4133.44 --> 4139.04
challenged for the reasons that i kind

4136.88 --> 4142.319
of escaped to this

4139.04 --> 4147.5199999999995
position ability to

4142.319 --> 4149.4400000000005
properly deal with social society

4147.52 --> 4152.400000000001
the complications because of the

4149.44 --> 4155.2789999999995
intellect difference

4152.4 --> 4157.759
and how that has kind of made it very

4155.279 --> 4159.679
hard for me to just take a stance

4157.759 --> 4161.199
like everybody else does it's like you

4159.679 --> 4163.04
take a stance

4161.199 --> 4164.4
that is accepted you don't have to think

4163.04 --> 4168.239
about it anymore

4164.4 --> 4168.239
i can't do that

4168.88 --> 4172.799
like i can only do that for like a

4172.0 --> 4177.759
minute

4172.799 --> 4177.759
and then i can't hold on to that anymore

4178.319 --> 4182.56
because the part where you just don't

4181.199 --> 4186.96
think about it i can't

4182.56 --> 4190.56
do that i just can't

4186.96 --> 4190.56
i'm i'm stuck

4191.759 --> 4202.56
stuck in wizard mode like

4195.04 --> 4205.6
maybe forever

4202.56 --> 4208.080000000001
i don't know i've grown too

4205.6 --> 4209.280000000001
literally associated with my conscious

4208.08 --> 4217.84
identity

4209.28 --> 4217.84
to be like this

4224.08 --> 4228.48
anyway yeah that tension on my jaw is

4227.28 --> 4230.239
not really

4228.48 --> 4232.32
completely gone but it has gone down a

4230.239 --> 4237.759999999999
little so thanks very much

4232.32 --> 4237.759999999999
and yeah looking forward to

4238.239 --> 4259.839999999999
getting some groceries with that

4244.56 --> 4259.84
right what was i talking about

4281.84 --> 4287.84
not reading geomatria's book

4294.56 --> 4301.280000000001
but why would you even need to

4297.84 --> 4304.64
like the best gematria in my opinion

4301.28 --> 4307.04
is keeping it ultra simple

4304.64 --> 4309.679
you know i've got my own weird little

4307.04 --> 4311.679
approach to geomatria that's completely

4309.679 --> 4314.4800000000005
non-read into is non-connected

4311.679 --> 4315.52
it's purely eclectic purely like

4314.48 --> 4318.959999999999
literally

4315.52 --> 4322.400000000001
i put the blocks together myself

4318.96 --> 4324.2390000000005
just rough references right and that is

4322.4 --> 4328.799999999999
if you take the numbers

4324.239 --> 4329.678999999999
for actual symbols you look at it like

4328.8 --> 4331.76
that

4329.679 --> 4333.92
don't they're not really numbers anymore

4331.76 --> 4337.280000000001
but they become symbols

4333.92 --> 4339.84
and then cross-referencing those symbols

4337.28 --> 4341.5199999999995
with a whole bunch of things out there

4339.84 --> 4342.2390000000005
now then you can get a really

4341.52 --> 4345.6
interesting

4342.239 --> 4349.199
little gematria like

4345.6 --> 4351.84
inside because every every number is

4349.199 --> 4351.839999999999
magical

4352.08 --> 4356.0
right it's just when you go out and

4354.4 --> 4357.199
puzzling with it all the time and all

4356.0 --> 4358.0
right look the connection in that

4357.199 --> 4363.04
connection

4358.0 --> 4366.239
then actually the power is kind of lost

4363.04 --> 4370.08
it just becomes this mesh

4366.239 --> 4373.44
wire frame of connections

4370.08 --> 4373.44
becomes all exoteric

4374.0 --> 4377.52
so i just don't go there

4383.6 --> 4399.84
very clutch bear

4404.48 --> 4409.678999999999
right uh talking about which the whole

4407.76 --> 4412.320000000001
consciousness thing and that i

4409.679 --> 4413.6
i can't like go to that typical social

4412.32 --> 4415.599999999999
interaction

4413.6 --> 4417.52
default position like yeah you take a

4415.6 --> 4420.4800000000005
stance and then you just

4417.52 --> 4420.4800000000005
don't think about it

4422.4 --> 4428.08
i have managed to be able to do that

4425.28 --> 4430.08
with girlfriends

4428.08 --> 4433.199
but it's like i have to ask them

4430.08 --> 4433.199
permission first

4433.36 --> 4441.839999999999
it's i'm weird and it's okay

4438.08 --> 4441.84
and i'm a really good boyfriend

4443.6 --> 4455.84
i'm just like maybe not entirely what

4446.159 --> 4455.839999999999
you're used to

4480.84 --> 4483.84
okay

4492.719 --> 4497.84
yeah clutch bear how are you doing

4522.84 --> 4525.84
hmm

4535.12 --> 4539.84
all right good to hear clutch bear

4564.84 --> 4567.84
so

4577.92 --> 4594.0
oh you finished the project that's cool

4580.719 --> 4595.92
so you can start water

4594.0 --> 4597.679
right yeah clutch bear well i i was

4595.92 --> 4599.84
actually kind of

4597.679 --> 4600.88
gonna round out the show not too long

4599.84 --> 4603.4400000000005
from now

4600.88 --> 4604.400000000001
already gone over the time limit like 20

4603.44 --> 4608.639999999999
minutes

4604.4 --> 4610.719
but that's fine

4608.64 --> 4612.4800000000005
maybe i'm making up for on the times

4610.719 --> 4615.04
that i was late

4612.48 --> 4615.04
last week

4621.44 --> 4626.239
but yeah today's show was decently

4623.679 --> 4626.2390000000005
interesting

4630.08 --> 4640.32
bit of a waste about josh

4637.12 --> 4642.8
it's it's always like

4640.32 --> 4645.44
i always hope that they want resort to

4642.8 --> 4647.4400000000005
just pure at home in the end

4645.44 --> 4648.839999999999
but that they could like retract and

4647.44 --> 4652.5599999999995
like from the silence

4648.84 --> 4654.96
actually get a better grip on things

4652.56 --> 4656.8
but yeah so many of them just end up

4654.96 --> 4658.8
just completely ad homing and not

4656.8 --> 4660.88
listening anymore

4658.8 --> 4664.0
i really do see it as kind of tragic

4660.88 --> 4666.159000000001
when it happens

4664.0 --> 4679.84
such a wasted opportunity from their

4666.159 --> 4679.839999999999
part on their part

4680.0 --> 4693.84
hey zombies banana cam paul connell

4684.239 --> 4693.839999999999
good to see you

4718.84 --> 4721.84
hmm

4732.84 --> 4737.679
okay

4735.76 --> 4740.64
yeah by the way saudi banana can that's

4737.679 --> 4740.64
a really funny joke

4741.44 --> 4749.839999999999
you should tell tense man that one

4744.48 --> 4749.839999999999
you'll get him laughing for sure

4750.8 --> 4754.08
half an hour more

4754.4 --> 4756.799999999999
maybe

4760.0 --> 4763.84
if something interesting comes up

4777.04 --> 4780.4
they all laughed when i told them that

4779.36 --> 4783.679
one day i would

4780.4 --> 4788.0
discover the secrets of invisibility if

4783.679 --> 4788.0
only they could see me now yeah

4789.6 --> 4792.400000000001
very clever

4794.29 --> 4805.84
[Music]

4796.56 --> 4805.84
i appreciate that

4809.199 --> 4819.839999999999
can't figure out the fed numbers well

4811.92 --> 4819.84
that's because of all the premiers

4830.84 --> 4833.84
oh

4835.36 --> 4839.839999999999
why not practice ap what

4840.8 --> 4847.84
what do you mean

4853.28 --> 4860.48
oh christ yeah yeah i i don't know why

4857.36 --> 4862.099999999999
my freaking mute button look

4860.48 --> 4865.199
look

4862.1 --> 4865.1990000000005
[Music]

4868.91 --> 4876.4
[Music]

4873.76 --> 4879.12
and now it was actually on me what the

4876.4 --> 4879.12
[ __ ]

4879.52 --> 4885.120000000001
right the mute button

4882.639 --> 4886.8
it would be a mute sound would still

4885.12 --> 4888.88
come through

4886.8 --> 4891.04
i forgot about that but now that i held

4888.88 --> 4892.96
it up to show it to you then suddenly it

4891.04 --> 4895.12
didn't work on mute anymore oh this

4892.96 --> 4897.8
makes so much sense

4895.12 --> 4900.84
brilliant

4897.8 --> 4903.04
[Music]

4900.84 --> 4904.96
brilliant

4903.04 --> 4908.239
makes fairy lit let's test it one more

4904.96 --> 4908.2390000000005
time yeah

4914.84 --> 4917.84
what

4934.08 --> 4942.48
very odd very odd

4937.84 --> 4942.4800000000005
i'm really don't get like why

4943.12 --> 4945.84
anyway

4948.88 --> 4954.4800000000005
why not practice this extra projection i

4951.04 --> 4957.04
don't i don't do that

4954.48 --> 4958.32
i don't feel the need to project my

4957.04 --> 4960.8
spirit physically

4958.32 --> 4963.36
into this world i don't need why would i

4960.8 --> 4966.0
need to do that

4963.36 --> 4966.0
i can just

4966.56 --> 4970.320000000001
do it from the dark world i could just

4968.719 --> 4971.84
do it from my dreamscape

4970.32 --> 4975.28
right everything is connected through

4971.84 --> 4975.28
the dreamscape everything

4983.52 --> 4986.88
right all you have to do is just connect

4985.76 --> 4990.320000000001
your dreaming

4986.88 --> 4992.2390000000005
to a to a standard instead of

4990.32 --> 4993.92
while dreaming where you're supposedly

4992.239 --> 4996.4
allowed to do anything

4993.92 --> 4998.159
because you think it's okay to fantasize

4996.4 --> 4999.679
it yeah if you do that then you're not

4998.159 --> 5001.12
gonna connect

4999.679 --> 5003.12
you're going to connect to others of

5001.12 --> 5005.36
that frequency

5003.12 --> 5007.04
when you let all the darkness go and

5005.36 --> 5009.199
realize

5007.04 --> 5010.88
that you are just as responsible for

5009.199 --> 5013.12
your own thoughts

5010.88 --> 5015.04
and feelings as you are for your own

5013.12 --> 5018.239
speech

5015.04 --> 5020.8
and actions then

5018.239 --> 5021.36
if you actually do that and there's

5020.8 --> 5025.52
almost

5021.36 --> 5025.5199999999995
nobody in the world that actually does

5026.84 --> 5031.52
that

5028.239 --> 5035.12
then yeah you can

5031.52 --> 5035.120000000001
perhaps do what i do too

5035.199 --> 5042.879999999999
that is just through the dream

5038.719 --> 5046.159
through the dreamscape connect

5042.88 --> 5047.4400000000005
puzzle things out simulate others by

5046.159 --> 5049.599999999999
basic yeah it's

5047.44 --> 5049.599999999999
just

5054.159 --> 5059.92
most of your dreams come true

5057.44 --> 5059.919999999999
all right

5060.48 --> 5063.36
that's interesting

5066.08 --> 5070.0
i think in a way a lot of my dreams come

5068.159 --> 5072.48
true as well but those

5070.0 --> 5076.48
dreams don't seem to really involve too

5072.48 --> 5079.04
much of my close proximity life

5076.48 --> 5083.12
it's more like things out there i dream

5079.04 --> 5083.12
a lot of what goes out in the world

5083.6 --> 5087.1990000000005
places that i've never even been

5088.32 --> 5092.639
so yeah my spirit dwells all over the

5096.84 --> 5099.84
world

5110.84 --> 5113.84
hmm

5124.84 --> 5127.84
hmm

5134.96 --> 5138.32
oh you're in a comedic mood today

5137.36 --> 5155.839999999999
soundly

5138.32 --> 5155.84
bananas cam soundly's banana can

5166.84 --> 5169.84
so

5171.04 --> 5183.84
okay seeking star wars that's bizarre

5188.08 --> 5191.28
ivory gate

5192.32 --> 5196.08
i never heard of that then again i

5194.48 --> 5200.799999999999
haven't really ever

5196.08 --> 5200.8
looked that deeply into egyptian stuff

5201.04 --> 5204.639
never got into that it's always it felt

5204.159 --> 5208.239
so

5204.639 --> 5208.2390000000005
arrogant to me

5208.32 --> 5215.12
or maybe it is like pre-pro

5210.76 --> 5215.12
pre-structural programming or something

5215.199 --> 5217.5199999999995
it's just

5220.0 --> 5225.84
i don't even want to judge about it

5258.639 --> 5264.0
okay that's interesting

5261.92 --> 5266.32
why are sunsets in australia in the

5264.0 --> 5268.56
summer very short and sunsets in europe

5266.32 --> 5273.28
very long

5268.56 --> 5276.4800000000005
i have no idea i don't think it really

5273.28 --> 5281.12
proves flat earth or globe

5276.48 --> 5284.159
but it is an interesting thing

5281.12 --> 5295.84
if that yeah if that's correct and i

5284.159 --> 5295.839999999999
take it then it is

5311.44 --> 5315.678999999999
okay seeking star well i guess then the

5313.92 --> 5316.56
dream is roaming off on you and it

5315.679 --> 5320.84
inspires you

5316.56 --> 5323.84
i i

5320.84 --> 5323.84
don't

5326.639 --> 5330.719
i don't even like the idea of ivory

5334.56 --> 5338.8
i just always keep thinking of like yeah

5336.96 --> 5341.44
what about the freaking animals it came

5338.8 --> 5341.4400000000005
from you know

5341.92 --> 5348.0
and how it happens like and then i get

5344.8 --> 5350.400000000001
all societal with it and think like okay

5348.0 --> 5351.52
why why don't they just freaking breathe

5350.4 --> 5354.08
those creatures if

5351.52 --> 5356.2390000000005
if you really want that precious ivory

5354.08 --> 5357.679
then freaking breathe the hell out of

5356.239 --> 5360.959999999999
them

5357.679 --> 5363.12
cultivate it right that that's like yo

5360.96 --> 5366.4
then you got the same as with the food

5363.12 --> 5369.5199999999995
industry yeah it is but yeah

5366.4 --> 5370.799999999999
but is it better to just let them go

5369.52 --> 5375.52
completely

5370.8 --> 5378.8
extinct instead right

5375.52 --> 5381.1990000000005
so every time i hear about ivory it just

5378.8 --> 5383.4400000000005
rises this conflict in my heart i don't

5381.199 --> 5386.799999999999
like it at all

5383.44 --> 5389.839999999999
because of what happens to

5386.8 --> 5391.76
get to that point with ivory i just

5389.84 --> 5394.8
don't

5391.76 --> 5394.8
think it's terrible

5404.159 --> 5411.759999999999
even though yeah ivory is a pretty

5407.28 --> 5414.48
special material that is true

5411.76 --> 5421.84
there is some very interesting qualities

5414.48 --> 5421.839999999999
to it

5437.96 --> 5441.05
[Music]

5454.4 --> 5460.839999999999
i mean like oh

5457.76 --> 5463.84
god i don't even want to go that

5460.84 --> 5463.84
direction

5466.48 --> 5471.5199999999995
it's like this okay if ivory is so

5468.639 --> 5476.2390000000005
critical for religious

5471.52 --> 5479.52
or medical purposes ridiculous

5476.239 --> 5482.5599999999995
then do the same thing with

5479.52 --> 5485.92
like elephants as you did with

5482.56 --> 5488.8
horses and cows and all that

5485.92 --> 5490.0
like find a way to actually like really

5488.8 --> 5492.400000000001
breed them and maybe

5490.0 --> 5494.48
you could even get them towards like

5492.4 --> 5496.159
having bigger tusks that they'll be like

5494.48 --> 5498.5599999999995
this relatively small elephant with

5496.159 --> 5502.799999999999
these huge tusks

5498.56 --> 5504.8
right so you can get your ivory

5502.8 --> 5507.4400000000005
and you don't have to let an entire

5504.8 --> 5511.1990000000005
species go extinct because of this

5507.44 --> 5519.839999999999
need for whatever it's worth right

5511.199 --> 5519.839999999999
i'm just trying to be pragmatic

5525.52 --> 5531.360000000001
don't want to hurt elephants i think

5528.0 --> 5534.08
elephants are really amazing creatures

5531.36 --> 5536.48
what on the same note kind of so are

5534.08 --> 5536.48
pigs

5536.88 --> 5542.96
they're also heavily underestimated

5540.8 --> 5547.84
how smart and socially aware they are

5542.96 --> 5547.84
and they have sensitivities

5550.32 --> 5552.639
all right

5553.6 --> 5557.84
and everybody's still okay that that's

5555.679 --> 5557.84
like

5558.08 --> 5561.84
being eaten you know

5575.52 --> 5580.639
anyway let's discontinue that

5577.6 --> 5580.639
conversation about

5586.84 --> 5589.84
ivory

5600.239 --> 5605.919999999999
not literal but if it's not literal then

5603.6 --> 5605.92
why

5606.639 --> 5609.76
why the material

5610.8 --> 5617.84
why the literal in the real world

5614.719 --> 5621.679
it will have like ivory and horn are

5617.84 --> 5624.8
literally from that creatures

5621.679 --> 5627.92
why would it have to be that right this

5624.8 --> 5627.92
all this weird [ __ ]

5628.239 --> 5636.5599999999995
also in just egyptian stuff

5631.679 --> 5636.56
like that it's i don't like it

5643.6 --> 5648.88
because they don't say that right they

5645.92 --> 5651.84
don't say it they just say oh look ivory

5648.88 --> 5651.84
don't talk about

5652.4 --> 5659.839999999999
where it comes from

5703.199 --> 5706.638999999999
quicker circles than slower circles

5705.44 --> 5708.759999999999
above the disc

5706.639 --> 5711.879
earth i take it hmm

5708.76 --> 5711.879
[Music]

5712.0 --> 5715.52
so you're gone paul connolly you're

5714.159 --> 5719.679
basically saying that

5715.52 --> 5720.080000000001
in the summer the angular speed of the

5719.679 --> 5723.52
sun

5720.08 --> 5729.199
is higher in australia

5723.52 --> 5732.719
than it would in england

5729.199 --> 5736.159
so the sun moves slower in the summer

5732.719 --> 5738.96
in the in the north is that basically

5736.159 --> 5738.96
what you're trying to

5740.84 --> 5743.84
explain

5768.84 --> 5771.84
hello

5778.639 --> 5782.0
right paul carl but i was asking

5780.679 --> 5785.36
specifically

5782.0 --> 5789.04
specifically the angular speed

5785.36 --> 5792.32
of the sun not quicker slower

5789.04 --> 5794.159
the angular speed specifically angular

5792.32 --> 5796.84
speed is only

5794.159 --> 5799.04
an angular speed to the observer in the

5796.84 --> 5803.360000000001
location

5799.04 --> 5806.96
above the disk that's cute right

5803.36 --> 5806.96
that's one way of thinking about it

5810.48 --> 5827.839999999999
i'm just asking very specifically

5828.239 --> 5832.5599999999995
basically saying that the sun in the

5830.88 --> 5837.1990000000005
summer

5832.56 --> 5837.1990000000005
south of the equator moves quicker

5838.84 --> 5841.84
so

5842.4 --> 5847.759999999999
it would both show probably more pathway

5848.239 --> 5854.32
a longer angular distance

5851.679 --> 5856.719
across this the demi sphere of how you

5854.32 --> 5856.719
see it

5857.76 --> 5862.639
but also faster with a faster angular

5860.719 --> 5863.44
speed compared to the north where the

5862.639 --> 5866.88
circle

5863.44 --> 5871.44
in relation during its summer

5866.88 --> 5874.639
would be shorter than the summer circuit

5871.44 --> 5876.4
south of the equator but the angular

5874.639 --> 5880.639
speed would also be

5876.4 --> 5883.28
slower in order to still

5880.639 --> 5884.32
give more output over the same time

5883.28 --> 5887.28
period

5884.32 --> 5887.28
that's what you're saying

5888.96 --> 5892.159
okay that's interesting well that

5891.199 --> 5895.28
certainly does

5892.159 --> 5899.28
play into the whole disc idea

5895.28 --> 5901.759999999999
right it certainly helps that specific

5899.28 --> 5904.32
idea of a disk

5901.76 --> 5906.400000000001
if you have such a sighting i wouldn't i

5904.32 --> 5909.36
understand

5906.4 --> 5910.239
it doesn't actually absolutely prove it

5909.36 --> 5913.44
though because

5910.239 --> 5920.0
the sun is not literally in any position

5913.44 --> 5920.0
moving from one euclidean location to

5922.84 --> 5925.84
another

5926.96 --> 5939.84
but it is very interesting to consider

5929.28 --> 5939.84
at least

5992.84 --> 5995.84
so

6006.84 --> 6009.84
hmm

6028.56 --> 6035.4400000000005
yeah interesting paul connell

6031.679 --> 6039.36
you certainly just helped inject that

6035.44 --> 6042.5599999999995
idea into my mind very clearly

6039.36 --> 6045.92
and yeah it does very much play into the

6042.56 --> 6048.159000000001
idea that the sun might be

6045.92 --> 6051.04
literally hovering over that disk in

6048.159 --> 6054.5599999999995
that sense

6051.04 --> 6057.76
even though within its actual

6054.56 --> 6061.280000000001
pathway if you would assume

6057.76 --> 6063.76
that the sun pathway as it goes

6061.28 --> 6065.599999999999
is actually you're looking at an object

6063.76 --> 6068.96
with the euclidean position

6065.6 --> 6071.6
which would be subjected by perspective

6068.96 --> 6074.0
then suddenly it doesn't really work out

6071.6 --> 6074.0
anymore

6074.239 --> 6079.199
right because then the angular speeds

6077.199 --> 6082.32
would change

6079.199 --> 6085.759999999999
at the horizon and they don't

6082.32 --> 6089.44
angular speed is consistent see

6085.76 --> 6091.1990000000005
i spotted this four years ago

6089.44 --> 6094.638999999999
kept saying that and nobody even

6091.199 --> 6097.119
freaking understood what i was saying

6094.639 --> 6099.1990000000005
before they started to realize that the

6097.119 --> 6100.0
heavenly bodies including the sun might

6099.199 --> 6103.44
not be

6100.0 --> 6105.44
yeah physical objects now people are

6103.44 --> 6108.239
starting to consider that

6105.44 --> 6109.28
it might not be as physically literal as

6108.239 --> 6113.199
they had assumed

6109.28 --> 6113.199
because of physicality assumption bias

6115.04 --> 6120.639
but yes the correlation of the circular

6119.76 --> 6124.159000000001
patterns

6120.639 --> 6127.6
in summer and winter of the south versus

6124.159 --> 6127.599999999999
the north it is very

6132.84 --> 6135.84
interesting

6142.48 --> 6146.48
all right oh yeah and seeking star wars

6145.04 --> 6148.639
you said

6146.48 --> 6150.159
it is scientifically proven that the sun

6148.639 --> 6153.28
changes speed during the year

6150.159 --> 6154.638999999999
well no not scientifically it's just an

6153.28 --> 6157.119
observation

6154.639 --> 6159.28
but it is consistent but here's the

6157.119 --> 6163.199
thing though

6159.28 --> 6164.719
it only changes speed in a singular

6163.199 --> 6168.0
circuit

6164.719 --> 6171.6
like once

6168.0 --> 6174.88
the sun is visibly traveling

6171.6 --> 6177.4400000000005
then it doesn't change speed until it's

6174.88 --> 6182.32
disappeared

6177.44 --> 6185.678999999999
so yeah so the speed angular speed

6182.32 --> 6186.719
is set for the day every single time it

6185.679 --> 6190.0
doesn't change

6186.719 --> 6193.04
speed during the virtual

6190.0 --> 6196.08
trajectory right the angular speed of

6193.04 --> 6199.76
the sun is always consistent

6196.08 --> 6201.04
but depending on its trajectory for the

6199.76 --> 6204.159000000001
day

6201.04 --> 6207.199
then the speed the angular speed might

6204.159 --> 6210.0
increase or decrease depending on the

6207.199 --> 6213.919999999999
total trajectory for the day

6210.0 --> 6217.119
right so yes the the sun

6213.92 --> 6220.56
the angular speed of the sun just change

6217.119 --> 6221.599999999999
throughout the year but it doesn't

6220.56 --> 6226.4800000000005
throughout the day

6221.6 --> 6228.96
and that completely throws out the door

6226.48 --> 6229.919999999999
any notion of evidence that it's

6228.96 --> 6232.32
actually a

6229.92 --> 6233.1990000000005
physical thing in the euclidean position

6232.32 --> 6237.04
of hovering

6233.199 --> 6241.04
over a disk right it's one step

6237.04 --> 6243.679
too far to assume because there yeah

6241.04 --> 6244.159
because then if that were the case if it

6243.679 --> 6246.88
does

6244.159 --> 6247.199
change in angular speed during the day

6246.88 --> 6251.119
then

6247.199 --> 6254.5599999999995
one could assume that perspective

6251.119 --> 6256.639
is involved in that process but it's not

6254.56 --> 6258.84
because the angular speed doesn't change

6256.639 --> 6261.84
throughout the day

6258.84 --> 6261.84
see

6286.96 --> 6291.92
the sun changes location in the sky

6292.08 --> 6295.76
you mean the angular pathway there is no

6294.8 --> 6299.119000000001
location

6295.76 --> 6303.84
a location is a terminology

6299.119 --> 6303.839999999999
that requires exact position

6305.6 --> 6309.119000000001
right sun doesn't have a position it

6308.48 --> 6312.239
only has an

6309.119 --> 6317.839999999999
angular apparent position in relation to

6312.239 --> 6317.839999999999
the observer

6320.239 --> 6325.04
and yes the trajectory is changing

6328.639 --> 6335.76
the circuit of its pathway in the day

6332.48 --> 6339.36
that does change throughout the year

6335.76 --> 6343.119000000001
the angular speed over a singular

6339.36 --> 6347.28
circuit of a day

6343.119 --> 6348.48
that doesn't change once the circuit is

6347.28 --> 6351.599999999999
set

6348.48 --> 6354.0
for the day and predicted then

6351.6 --> 6356.2390000000005
it the sun will have a certain angular

6354.0 --> 6358.48
speed throughout the entire circuit and

6356.239 --> 6360.32
it will be consistent

6358.48 --> 6362.638999999999
so once the circuit is set whether it's

6360.32 --> 6365.28
short whether it's big

6362.639 --> 6367.76
that determines the angular speed for

6365.28 --> 6367.759999999999
the day

6368.08 --> 6375.5199999999995
right it doesn't just change

6372.4 --> 6386.879999999999
in the middle of the day never ever

6375.52 --> 6388.639
it's never been seen

6386.88 --> 6390.159000000001
and if it would be seen that would be

6388.639 --> 6392.56
quite bizarre

6390.159 --> 6394.638999999999
maybe there are moments where literally

6392.56 --> 6396.56
it's like okay it's now transitioning

6394.639 --> 6399.28
from a spring to a summer

6396.56 --> 6400.719
sun that you would literally just in a

6399.28 --> 6402.5599999999995
trajectory like

6400.719 --> 6404.0
oh it's different now and it's going in

6402.56 --> 6406.56
a slightly different path

6404.0 --> 6409.28
that might happen it might have a switch

6406.56 --> 6412.159000000001
moment or something

6409.28 --> 6413.759999999999
but it doesn't gradually change the

6412.159 --> 6416.5599999999995
angular speed over

6413.76 --> 6417.76
a day circuit that doesn't happen might

6416.56 --> 6421.04
switch

6417.76 --> 6424.88
somewhere but it doesn't gradually

6421.04 --> 6425.5199999999995
transition angular speed for a singular

6424.88 --> 6429.84
circuit

6425.52 --> 6429.84
is consistent

6430.159 --> 6434.879999999999
right and with that i'm gonna round out

6431.679 --> 6437.679
the show so thanks everyone for coming

6434.88 --> 6438.56
i hope you like the show it's a bit over

6437.679 --> 6441.28
the place but

6438.56 --> 6442.639
very technical too so it was interesting

6441.28 --> 6444.48
i think

6442.639 --> 6446.8
if you like this show then please don't

6444.48 --> 6447.599999999999
forget to rogan's it up and if you

6446.8 --> 6450.08
haven't already

6447.6 --> 6451.76
subscribed to me subscribe to my channel

6450.08 --> 6454.08
and hit the bell notification

6451.76 --> 6455.92
so you know when i'm going live which is

6454.08 --> 6458.0
normally 1pm amsterdam time in the

6455.92 --> 6458.96
weekdays and 2pm amsterdam time in the

6458.0 --> 6461.36
weekend

6458.96 --> 6462.08
please also do support me through the

6461.36 --> 6465.119
paypal

6462.08 --> 6468.0
especially patreon also crypto wallets

6465.119 --> 6468.48
for tryouts would be nice and the super

6468.0 --> 6471.6
chat

6468.48 --> 6472.5599999999995
basically for just messaging the join

6471.6 --> 6475.6
button

6472.56 --> 6477.52
also membership system

6475.6 --> 6479.679
that would be much appreciated and

6477.52 --> 6482.8
thanks for the support that i got today

6479.679 --> 6486.159
i really do appreciate it still only a

6482.8 --> 6488.4800000000005
start i i definitely use more

6486.159 --> 6489.839999999999
but yeah that's that was a great relief

6488.48 --> 6492.32
thank you for that

6489.84 --> 6494.08
hope the show was to all of your

6492.32 --> 6496.32
satisfactory it was a two

6494.08 --> 6498.639
hour show instead of the normal one for

6496.32 --> 6501.679
the weekend

6498.639 --> 6503.679
right anyway

6501.679 --> 6506.4800000000005
i will be back tomorrow with flat earth

6503.679 --> 6510.159
early bird number 923

6506.48 --> 6512.0
sunday edition and tonight if

6510.159 --> 6513.599999999999
everything is alright there should be a

6512.0 --> 6516.8
live ball busters

6513.6 --> 6518.719
about spectroscopy apparently
