131.17 --> 137.22
January 1st 2020 how about that

138.35 --> 141.509
[Music]

145.01 --> 154.069
so yeah I guess a lot of people are slow

148.55 --> 161.34900000000002
to to get in it's not surprising but AGM

154.069 --> 171.58999999999997

161.349 --> 173.98
Katrina's Katrine Scott Amanda young /

171.59 --> 173.98
McCoy

Karen Fox heard of Karen Cox okay hello

189.98 --> 194.88
and Fyodor Dostoevsky yeah good to see

194.34 --> 202.02
you all

194.88 --> 207.14
good morning yeah I I had a lot of fun

202.02 --> 211.5
yesterday but since my New Year's Eve

207.14 --> 216.95899999999997
video seemed kind of wonky because yeah

211.5 --> 219.0
I kind of messed up I couldn't hold back

216.959 --> 220.92000000000002
on the beer in the afternoon and

219.0 --> 227.13
everybody was already such a celebratory

220.92 --> 230.25
mood like in the after-show and and then

227.13 --> 232.53
eventually yeah when I was like 10

230.25 --> 234.87
o'clock I just got really tired I

232.53 --> 238.47
thought like god I'll just take a short

234.87 --> 239.70000000000002
nap right before and then I took a

238.47 --> 242.73
little bit longer than that than I

239.7 --> 244.5
expected so I pretty much woke up got

242.73 --> 248.22
started like oh [ __ ] I have to show

244.5 --> 251.67
start to show like now like within 5

248.22 --> 256.58
minutes um and that's why my hair was

251.67 --> 259.68
all so messed up but yeah is what it is

256.58 --> 263.21999999999997
it was kind of disappointing even like

259.68 --> 264.90000000000003
how little you could see with my webcam

263.22 --> 270.3
of the fireworks of course everybody

264.9 --> 272.90999999999997
could hear it but I could with my eyes

270.3 --> 275.43
still see a little bit more than the

272.91 --> 277.35
webcam could pick up and I just noticed

275.43 --> 279.12
that all the fireworks everywhere it

277.35 --> 282.21000000000004
just looked red whatever I could see

279.12 --> 284.57
most of it was all red Oh red from the

282.21 --> 284.57
smoke

286.65 --> 289.65
yeah

295.59 --> 309.03
but yeah it was all good shell-shocked

303.54 --> 314.61
why would I get that no I look last year

309.03 --> 316.77
I had a moment where I was using my bike

314.61 --> 320.55
to get some groceries or something and

316.77 --> 326.07
then some idiot threw like a very high

320.55 --> 331.32
explosive type cracker on the on the

326.07 --> 333.24
biking lane and yeah it went off like

331.32 --> 335.25
within two meters but I did see it

333.24 --> 338.33
coming but it was just too loud and you

335.25 --> 340.68
get a bit shell-shocked from that I

338.33 --> 345.93
nothing like that happened this year I

340.68 --> 349.95
was way too careful and I've already got

345.93 --> 351.6
my groceries when I knew that yeah most

349.95 --> 354.84
people that are go ballistic with

351.6 --> 357.45000000000005
fireworks aren't aren't gonna be out yet

354.84 --> 360.06
aren't gonna be out doing that yet so I

357.45 --> 362.34
managed to avoid any any kind of shell

360.06 --> 365.33
shock this year I'm glad of it

362.34 --> 365.33
it sucks

370.87 --> 373.87
okay

386.879 --> 390.659
yeah yeah well kamikaze Gilmore it is

389.969 --> 393.209
what it is

390.659 --> 401.30899999999997
it's the Netherlands it's always been

393.209 --> 404.069
like this it's like Dutch the Dutch have

401.309 --> 408.02900000000005
been very stubborn about about it like

404.069 --> 410.66900000000004
yeah everybody thinks it's crazy and the

408.029 --> 413.639
rest of the world we don't care we do

410.669 --> 420.24
this leave it alone it's ours it's our

413.639 --> 424.589
thing and we don't on purpose hurt

420.24 --> 426.539
animals even though there's some freaky

424.589 --> 429.499
psychopath kids that may be inclined to

426.539 --> 432.269
do that such a thing but it's illegal so

429.499 --> 436.86
yeah [ __ ] happens

432.269 --> 442.169
I don't know if anything like that

436.86 --> 444.92900000000003
happened this year I hope not I haven't

442.169 --> 447.94899999999996
watched any of the statistics of all the

444.929 --> 451.529
accidents that happen or anything so

447.949 --> 454.939
might take a look at the that the Dutch

451.529 --> 454.939
news a little later and we'll see

457.81 --> 464.67
right oh good to hear Karen Cox and

461.35 --> 464.67
welcome in chat

480.28 --> 489.44
yeah yeah dogs dogs don't like fireworks

486.35 --> 491.57000000000005
on average they don't like the smell of

489.44 --> 495.29
it and they don't like the sound in the

491.57 --> 498.34
startling we have cats aren't a big fan

495.29 --> 501.73
of it yeah no animals really likes it

498.34 --> 501.72999999999996
it's just

519.23 --> 529.4
hmm interesting yeah 2020 it's gonna be

525.74 --> 536.32
a very special year in all kinds of

529.4 --> 536.3199999999999
directions it's gonna get pretty intense

561.15 --> 566.91
Tory said what what does that mean

564.22 --> 566.9100000000001
Jeffrey bill

574.17 --> 580.039
[Music]

601.01 --> 609.519
okay if you say so it certainly seems to

606.32 --> 609.519
be on the table

619.73 --> 625.9200000000001
why kamikaze Gilmore why do you keep

622.949 --> 628.139
asking like everybody keeps on asking

625.92 --> 630.7489999999999
it's a bow it's a prop

628.139 --> 634.8
yeah it could fire real arrows I don't

630.749 --> 642.119
use it I haven't tried in years I don't

634.8 --> 644.3689999999999
care it's just a bow it's just like in

642.119 --> 646.889
the last year alone I've had that

644.369 --> 651.3290000000001
question from so many different people

646.889 --> 652.23
like 20 times come on it's just a bow

651.329 --> 653.8499999999999
it's a prop

652.23 --> 656.6990000000001
have you ever seen me do anything with

653.85 --> 658.9490000000001
it no if I am gonna do something with

656.699 --> 666.149
that bow I'll tell you I'll damn well

658.949 --> 668.8789999999999
tell you okay you don't need to it's not

666.149 --> 677.389
something that I'm gonna do anything

668.879 --> 677.389
with yeah I know

685.44 --> 690.7790000000001
but to me it's just like yeah our

688.079 --> 693.269
weinerman why didn't you talk about that

690.779 --> 696.54
chair are you gonna do something with

693.269 --> 699.329
the chair the chair like it's just a

696.54 --> 703.829
thing it's not

699.329 --> 707.449
I'm not a Archer a practicing Archer at

703.829 --> 707.449
the moment I have a bit

711.089 --> 719.599
I guess I don't know it's just that

725.2 --> 731.6500000000001
bow is a weapon of war okay

728.65 --> 731.65
maybe

735.13 --> 744.82
I thought I just thought it was an

738.34 --> 747.37
interesting addition I guess to my my

744.82 --> 751.48
what I do here on the Internet b-being

747.37 --> 755.14
Arwen constantly associated with elves

751.48 --> 758.62
and Legolas thanks chocolate and it's

755.14 --> 762.34
black just like how I like my clothing

758.62 --> 766.6
style and yeah it kind of fits so but

762.34 --> 769.0
I'm not this is not the I am an elf I'm

766.6 --> 775.84
going to shoot this ball channel just so

769.0 --> 782.98
you know it's just a prop have you ever

775.84 --> 785.88
hunted a ball earth what dude that's

782.98 --> 785.88
just creepy man

793.2 --> 805.1700000000001
yes silly silly boy Adam hey I might

802.31 --> 806.6999999999999
metaphorically hunt ballers down but I

805.17 --> 811.74
would be hunting them down with

806.7 --> 815.22
arguments because I got a lot of that I

811.74 --> 819.6
don't really need any boat to get some

815.22 --> 823.0400000000001
kind of victory or violence in any form

819.6 --> 823.0400000000001
for that matter

835.36 --> 842.29
okay Zep tepi yeah that's fine it was it

839.619 --> 845.619
was a bit sloppy anyway I liked my video

842.29 --> 853.449
from last year more but happy New Year

845.619 --> 857.499
to you oh yeah and also during that

853.449 --> 861.549
during that little thing I dropped an

857.499 --> 863.529
entire or I pushed over a glass we

861.549 --> 867.73
filled with soup and all kinds of stuff

863.529 --> 870.309
like that I even put my webcam in front

867.73 --> 874.149
of it for moments so it was a really

870.309 --> 876.309
messy stream literally didn't distract

874.149 --> 878.559
too much didn't let it distract me or

876.309 --> 880.86
get me in a bad mood but yeah it was a

878.559 --> 880.86
mess

889.77 --> 892.77
Wow

916.61 --> 923.899
hmm yeah it was fun

919.579 --> 928.0089999999999
it was still fun but yeah it didn't turn

923.899 --> 932.029
out what I wanted to do so next time I'm

928.009 --> 934.069
gonna have to like really hold my

932.029 --> 940.279
discipline and not start drinking beer

934.069 --> 944.439
until it's like much later but yeah it

940.279 --> 944.439
is what it is I had to do

948.33 --> 951.4290000000001
[Music]

962.579 --> 972.199
ah he's back whatever it's all cool I

969.239 --> 972.1990000000001
know it's okay it's fine

983.97 --> 994.889
in a way also the experience is kind of

987.059 --> 997.1089999999999
different as well because last year from

994.889 --> 1004.729
the transition from two thousand eighty

997.109 --> 1008.0590000000001
to ninety I had a lot more worries and

1004.729 --> 1011.749
fear for the future like I still had a

1008.059 --> 1016.579
lot of issues my my visions already was

1011.749 --> 1019.519
kind of unraveling much of it that like

1016.579 --> 1022.039
figuring out with my intuition that

1019.519 --> 1025.879
there was indeed just blatant lies

1022.039 --> 1028.25
inserted in there to fool me and because

1025.879 --> 1030.62
yeah when it all broke to me

1028.25 --> 1032.629
my visions and everything I didn't know

1030.62 --> 1035.2689999999998
that yet and I thought everything was

1032.629 --> 1037.129
real in some way I was they had another

1035.269 --> 1040.519
angle of approach it was much more

1037.129 --> 1043.1
worrisome fear inducing and I have

1040.519 --> 1046.819
unraveled that and with the switch this

1043.1 --> 1051.529
year in December 15 where my seventh

1046.819 --> 1054.86
chakra was basically restored it's yeah

1051.529 --> 1059.74
the outlook for this year is just very

1054.86 --> 1063.83
different for me like really different

1059.74 --> 1067.039
not so much as that okay I'm gonna

1063.83 --> 1069.529
completely do totally other things I'm

1067.039 --> 1074.74
probably still gonna do the show for a

1069.529 --> 1077.47
while and maybe maybe I don't know

1074.74 --> 1080.69
discontinue it at some point and then

1077.47 --> 1082.49
try another type of show for another

1080.69 --> 1084.95
timeslot I've talked about it I'm not

1082.49 --> 1087.98
sure you know maybe I will really like

1084.95 --> 1089.809
doing what I do and just keep on doing

1087.98 --> 1092.6
this maybe it work it will work out

1089.809 --> 1097.129
great there's a lot more financial

1092.6 --> 1099.799
promises for me in this year that I've

1097.129 --> 1103.039
been waiting on pretty much for years

1099.799 --> 1105.799
now and looks like it could might just

1103.039 --> 1109.279
come to fruition really this year and

1105.799 --> 1111.399
that's that's very promising outlook for

1109.279 --> 1111.399
me

1111.61 --> 1121.7199999999998
and yeah and my seventh chakra is

1117.77 --> 1127.34
restored so I feel much closer now with

1121.72 --> 1133.22
with my conscious to be able to more

1127.34 --> 1138.6799999999998
effectively work on my life instead of

1133.22 --> 1140.45
just analyzing everything for I feel

1138.68 --> 1143.3
more in contact it's ironic because

1140.45 --> 1146.03
that's literally what the chakra energy

1143.3 --> 1148.49
frequencies what that stands for but

1146.03 --> 1152.68
effectively psychologically it seems to

1148.49 --> 1155.93
mirror back exactly what has changed and

1152.68 --> 1158.66
it's that's fantastical to me and that I

1155.93 --> 1165.95
can even see that don't know if other

1158.66 --> 1167.78
people will feel it but yeah this year

1165.95 --> 1170.53
is very promising for me for me

1167.78 --> 1170.53
personally and

1174.72 --> 1179.1000000000001
I don't know I'm not gonna make lay out

1177.21 --> 1182.25
specific predictions it's just

1179.1 --> 1184.5
everything that I have foreseen that I

1182.25 --> 1187.38
have predicted that would happen or that

1184.5 --> 1190.82
should happen even from within the

1187.38 --> 1194.64
baller community where they should build

1190.82 --> 1197.49
their model towards to fix to overcome

1194.64 --> 1202.47
problems and I think all of that will

1197.49 --> 1205.17
basically transpire because so much of

1202.47 --> 1207.39
what I have predicted which is just such

1205.17 --> 1208.49
little things I don't like build a show

1207.39 --> 1212.1000000000001
around it

1208.49 --> 1218.07
but so much has actually transpired if

1212.1 --> 1220.83
you know what I mean like even the first

1218.07 --> 1227.31
signs of the the gravity barrier which

1220.83 --> 1230.28
must be because it's the only way to

1227.31 --> 1234.6
maintain some kind of vacuous setup for

1230.28 --> 1236.6399999999999
the universe and hey gravity is very

1234.6 --> 1238.26
malleable they don't nobody real

1236.64 --> 1241.23
iterally knows what it is it's been

1238.26 --> 1243.21
conceptualized in some way but it

1241.23 --> 1247.44
nothing is really there so you could

1243.21 --> 1249.66
still tinker with the possibilities and

1247.44 --> 1253.17
just see oh wow we didn't realize this

1249.66 --> 1258.03
yet and in a way that's what the global

1253.17 --> 1263.5800000000002
priests do but they just suck at it I'm

1258.03 --> 1266.07
looking at it's like you guys suck it's

1263.58 --> 1268.23
like I'm seeing this group of people

1266.07 --> 1273.59
working with their Legos and they're

1268.23 --> 1273.59
building [ __ ] it sucks it's bad design

1283.04 --> 1286.04
anyway

1286.16 --> 1291.47
[Music]

1297.94 --> 1301.019
[Music]

1303.86 --> 1307.09
[Music]

1307.73 --> 1317.6100000000001
it's what an acceleration acceleration

1314.82 --> 1320.07
is gravity right well I think that

1317.61 --> 1322.11
acceleration is the manifestation of

1320.07 --> 1326.3999999999999
displacement now what causes this

1322.11 --> 1329.34
displacement yeah you gotta you gotta

1326.4 --> 1331.02
have to actually point at what that is

1329.34 --> 1335.3999999999999
and also there's this thing about

1331.02 --> 1337.98
displacement it's called a force that's

1335.4 --> 1340.23
like mechanics basic Newtonian

1337.98 --> 1342.99
conceptualised movement mechanics with

1340.23 --> 1346.35
matter so displacement that must be a

1342.99 --> 1349.29
force well you don't know whether

1346.35 --> 1353.37
gravity is a force or not because

1349.29 --> 1358.3799999999999
officially it's not something else it's

1353.37 --> 1360.4799999999998
more a backdrop thing but there's no

1358.38 --> 1362.8400000000001
real proof for it it it is a conceptual

1360.48 --> 1366.9
it's an aberration it's a concept a

1362.84 --> 1368.73
theory or construct that ties into all

1366.9 --> 1372.18
kinds of loose ends

1368.73 --> 1372.63
beyond the empirical and that's what it

1372.18 --> 1376.89
is

1372.63 --> 1379.1000000000001
I haven't seen the last of gravity

1376.89 --> 1379.1000000000001
though

1385.77 --> 1395.02
okay people just this one I'm pretty

1392.83 --> 1397.3
sure it's one singular troll just

1395.02 --> 1400.8
outright ban em straight away as soon as

1397.3 --> 1403.44
you see then yeah that type of name

1400.8 --> 1411.58
thank you very much

1403.44 --> 1413.92
hello chou-heung cat morning measurable

1411.58 --> 1417.97
force it's a force right yeah but you

1413.92 --> 1420.13
don't really know you're just saying

1417.97 --> 1422.47
that I know you can think of it as such

1420.13 --> 1425.0200000000002
but it's not official

1422.47 --> 1429.22
that's a colloquial approach doesn't tie

1425.02 --> 1434.3799999999999
into what gravity really is in the

1429.22 --> 1437.76
astronomical scale of things you got to

1434.38 --> 1437.7600000000002
realize that big jungus

1451.039 --> 1454.039
Wow

1457.96 --> 1462.0900000000001
man somebody's having a

1466.81 --> 1471.31
mmm I think somebody's having a hard-on

1470.38 --> 1473.43
for me or something

1471.31 --> 1473.4299999999998
Oh

1477.52 --> 1483.01
I don't know if I wear them I just go

1480.429 --> 1490.72
out and take a calm walk and enjoy the

1483.01 --> 1494.83
peace and quiet and and that not get so

1490.72 --> 1497.79
worked up about all these pervy

1494.83 --> 1497.79
fantasies of there

1502.84 --> 1511.1999999999998
yeah I know is that Pepe I know but it

1508.389 --> 1518.1689999999999
is also kind of the reason why I do it

1511.2 --> 1521.8600000000001
you know yeah when I get on Jose's I get

1518.169 --> 1524.1390000000001
on Jose's I'm not just gonna quietly sit

1521.86 --> 1525.85
in the background like I do a lot of the

1524.139 --> 1528.639
time with Nathan's because Nathan is

1525.85 --> 1530.86
wielding the show Jose is letting

1528.639 --> 1535.09
everyone do whatever they want pretty

1530.86 --> 1538.119
much and just trying as a trying to be a

1535.09 --> 1541.24
guide kind of like direct the

1538.119 --> 1545.259
conversation a bit but he isn't doing it

1541.24 --> 1547.09
he's lit yeah just giving some guidance

1545.259 --> 1549.749
and trying to keep people in line if he

1547.09 --> 1551.98
thinks isn't necessary yeah but so

1549.749 --> 1555.309
people are left to their devices and

1551.98 --> 1557.759
when I get in there I'm gonna get in

1555.309 --> 1561.309
there with a lot of decisiveness and

1557.759 --> 1565.24
assurance from my side because I know

1561.309 --> 1567.85
what I'm doing and it's gonna piss off a

1565.24 --> 1571.08
lot of ballers because they are all used

1567.85 --> 1573.399
to having all of that covered up by

1571.08 --> 1575.259
everyone all patting each other on the

1573.399 --> 1578.649
back or like yeah oh you're such a good

1575.259 --> 1581.169
intellectual globulin and just tinker

1578.649 --> 1584.549
with their little toys that rests on top

1581.169 --> 1587.679
of it all within the specula Tory realm

1584.549 --> 1590.23
so when I get in there and it just

1587.679 --> 1591.759
starts smacking away the toy say that's

1590.23 --> 1593.83
all [ __ ] where's it come from

1591.759 --> 1597.19
where's the empirical evidence and then

1593.83 --> 1600.21
get very concise and just say no I want

1597.19 --> 1607.1100000000001
a photograph that satellite in orbit I

1600.21 --> 1610.3890000000001
want to see how a signal is being

1607.11 --> 1612.7299999999998
bounced off the moon and I want the

1610.389 --> 1616.629
direction changed and all that to really

1612.73 --> 1618.46
on-the-spot visually confirm whether it

1616.629 --> 1620.11
is actually directed at the moon or just

1618.46 --> 1623.3500000000001
towards the sky

1620.11 --> 1625.299
and all of that I've been doing these

1623.35 --> 1626.98
types of things like show me the

1625.299 --> 1628.899
empirical evidence don't tell me to go

1626.98 --> 1631.779
and find it it must be out there oh so

1628.899 --> 1633.9699999999998
many people rubber no no if it's so

1631.779 --> 1635.429
abundantly out there then why aren't you

1633.97 --> 1638.009
shoving it in my face

1635.429 --> 1640.3790000000001
or you just have to go to this special

1638.009 --> 1641.969
Institute of building all they got

1640.379 --> 1645.539
everything you need and they got this

1641.969 --> 1649.469
perfect unique telescope just look into

1645.539 --> 1652.589
that and you'll see what you need all

1649.469 --> 1654.8990000000001
right it's not not fixed rigged or

1652.589 --> 1658.1689999999999
anything it's not suspicious now now we

1654.899 --> 1661.289
can't just see it with our camera or our

1658.169 --> 1662.8790000000001
own telescope no you have to go to the

1661.289 --> 1666.69
special place to look through the

1662.879 --> 1669.7489999999998
special thing no that's all [ __ ]

1666.69 --> 1671.8490000000002
there's hundreds of thousands of

1669.749 --> 1674.669
satellites floating over us constantly

1671.849 --> 1678.6899999999998
some standing still some floating around

1674.669 --> 1680.8790000000001
you should see sunshine reflection of it

1678.69 --> 1684.029
and yeah if it's in the middle of the

1680.879 --> 1687.2389999999998
night and the Sun is pre supposedly on

1684.029 --> 1689.7
the other side of the earth then if we

1687.239 --> 1694.409
do see these satellites suppose the the

1689.7 --> 1697.289
lights floating by what is that light

1694.409 --> 1698.969
what light is actually reflecting of it

1697.289 --> 1700.649
in order to be that bright which

1698.969 --> 1704.549
normally would be sunlight right well

1700.649 --> 1706.7389999999998
that satellite is now assumed to be on

1704.549 --> 1709.259
the dark side of the earth in the orbit

1706.739 --> 1712.849
on the dark side so why do you see

1709.259 --> 1716.309
anything why is it not just purely dark

1712.849 --> 1717.7189999999998
because there's no sun reflecting off it

1716.309 --> 1719.519
because the Sun is on the other side of

1717.719 --> 1722.309
the earth so what is making that so

1719.519 --> 1723.869
bright makes no sense that's not proof

1722.309 --> 1725.46
it's satellite and they don't have any

1723.869 --> 1728.9689999999998
physical features they're literally

1725.46 --> 1732.539
lights just like the Stars so where is

1728.969 --> 1736.489
the empirical evidence of a satellite in

1732.539 --> 1736.489
orbit where is that photograph

1741.75 --> 1747.03
and yeah I try to insert this kind of

1744.36 --> 1748.59
thing in josé's but yeah they all talk

1747.03 --> 1751.8
out for me so after get a little bit

1748.59 --> 1753.9299999999998
more loud more loud just to try to make

1751.8 --> 1755.97
sure it comes through and thankfully

1753.93 --> 1761.43
afterward it does seem to have come

1755.97 --> 1763.68
through when I do that and yeah my

1761.43 --> 1767.1000000000001
arguments get made and then I leave and

1763.68 --> 1771.0600000000002
then they can all like complain complain

1767.1 --> 1772.77
about me and I'm so misled and oh this

1771.06 --> 1775.3799999999999
and dad and I shouldn't have done this

1772.77 --> 1778.44
and that and distract away from things I

1775.38 --> 1780.5700000000002
actually said of course this is because

1778.44 --> 1783.54
that's what they always do every single

1780.57 --> 1786.06
time I know that happens so I can never

1783.54 --> 1789.6
leave and then imagine that they'd all

1786.06 --> 1795.9199999999998
just give me a win because they're not

1789.6 --> 1795.9199999999998
and that's yeah that's what I expect

1801.99 --> 1805.069
[Music]

1809.84 --> 1816.32
yeah there's some really messed up

1811.98 --> 1816.32
trolls in chat here so excuse me for any

1817.52 --> 1822.6589999999999
repulsive titles that are scrolling by I

1820.44 --> 1824.309
unfortunately can't get them out of a

1822.659 --> 1829.89
way quick enough sometimes because I

1824.309 --> 1833.4189999999999
also have a show seems my moderators

1829.89 --> 1833.419
aren't catching on to it

1842.89 --> 1850.01
measure its speed and realize that it

1846.41 --> 1852.5
must be in orifice its speed why don't

1850.01 --> 1855.71
you prove that it is actually a

1852.5 --> 1859.16
satellite now based on what I just

1855.71 --> 1862.3700000000001
explained big chunga's about these

1859.16 --> 1864.559
claimed satellite sites that can be seen

1862.37 --> 1867.11
from the ground level with cameras

1864.559 --> 1869.51
yourself and all that yeah well that's

1867.11 --> 1872.84
lights moving in a very specific speed

1869.51 --> 1875.8
and that have no features but being

1872.84 --> 1879.08
lysed just like the star so what light

1875.8 --> 1881.45
what is there light source what is

1879.08 --> 1884.09
reflecting off them in order to be so

1881.45 --> 1890.96
bright when they are on the dark side of

1884.09 --> 1897.4399999999998
the earth you tell me doesn't make any

1890.96 --> 1901.67
physical sense but I know you don't

1897.44 --> 1903.5900000000001
really think about it because you're

1901.67 --> 1906.5800000000002
just thankful enough that there is this

1903.59 --> 1909.559
weird little light phenomena out there

1906.58 --> 1911.6299999999999
that you can stamp your satellite claim

1909.559 --> 1914.9289999999999
onto without actually empirically

1911.63 --> 1917.3000000000002
proving it or showing how that would

1914.929 --> 1921.5500000000002
make sense in your model so I just

1917.3 --> 1921.55
showed it doesn't but

1923.26 --> 1928.99
doesn't prove that there's an actual

1925.539 --> 1932.74
physical satellite a box with solar

1928.99 --> 1943.09
panels in orbit because that's not what

1932.74 --> 1947.46
that looks like the Joker facts I don't

1943.09 --> 1952.3799999999999
know about Jaron isms video of the ISS

1947.46 --> 1955.1490000000001
I've seen weird things okay I've seen

1952.38 --> 1959.47
really weird things like even before

1955.149 --> 1961.4799999999998
Flat Earth I was interested in things

1959.47 --> 1964.059
out there and there was this telescope

1961.48 --> 1969.3700000000001
guy and he had some really far-out

1964.059 --> 1973.389
zoomed in mysterious things but of what

1969.37 --> 1975.309
seemed like giant spaceships of what I

1973.389 --> 1977.32
thought it would be in high orbit that

1975.309 --> 1979.899
was very fascinating but it looked like

1977.32 --> 1981.82
there were just lights dangly lights it

1979.899 --> 1983.83
was very mysterious what that was I

1981.82 --> 1987.99
don't know if that is some kind of

1983.83 --> 1987.99
internal rigging of the telescope I

1991.23 --> 1997.23
don't know what that was I don't know if

1994.21 --> 2000.1200000000001
the ISS if that is the similar effect

1997.23 --> 2002.45
because I'd like to see one of these

2000.12 --> 2002.4499999999998
things

2012.65 --> 2016.0
how do you say that

2016.36 --> 2022.269
it's just that it's with all the digital

2019.48 --> 2025.409
works these days it becomes more and

2022.269 --> 2029.019
more suspect so just blatantly trust any

2025.409 --> 2032.0800000000002
heavy telescope out there they because

2029.019 --> 2034.8990000000001
they could have inserted a trick in

2032.08 --> 2039.97
there to basically have the normal feel

2034.899 --> 2042.4289999999999
and then digitally add stuff into there

2039.97 --> 2044.71
based on the model of what is supposed

2042.429 --> 2049.3
to be out there it's it's a neat it

2044.71 --> 2052.089
could be made into a very neat trick so

2049.3 --> 2055.3590000000004
in that at that the real evidences will

2052.089 --> 2058.5099999999998
always be some kind of more pure optics

2055.359 --> 2062.23
based result like a real pure glass

2058.51 --> 2066.6690000000003
telescope no digital things like a real

2062.23 --> 2067.54
image projection the more based on on

2066.669 --> 2072.99
yeah

2067.54 --> 2072.99
a chemical situation rather than digital

2074.429 --> 2082.7200000000003
but yeah it is mysterious that there are

2078.73 --> 2085.81
these apparent spaceship or satellite

2082.72 --> 2090.359
like sightings with these weird the Jing

2085.81 --> 2090.359
Li lights Li the country it's so weird

2092.07 --> 2097.869
but that to me is not the proof of the

2095.5 --> 2100.39
the regular satellite in orbit what

2097.869 --> 2101.9500000000003
would the what the people have built you

2100.39 --> 2104.83
know what all these supposed satellite

2101.95 --> 2107.5
engineers have built and think that that

2104.83 --> 2109.48
has been launched in a rocket might

2107.5 --> 2112.39
maybe dangling out there on a balloon

2109.48 --> 2114.7
but if there's anything up there that's

2112.39 --> 2117.43
supposedly in orbit then I want to see

2114.7 --> 2120.8799999999997
just a normal kind of photograph of it

2117.43 --> 2126.2799999999997
of that type of thing there should be

2120.88 --> 2130.44
hundreds of thousands of them I don't

2126.28 --> 2130.44
see him nobody ever sees them

2136.43 --> 2139.5099999999998
[Music]

2150.87 --> 2158.2799999999997
astronomy life yeah sure sure is that

2155.86 --> 2158.28
Pepe

2174.09 --> 2177.55
just good that is channel just go to

2176.71 --> 2182.26
that channel

2177.55 --> 2185.65
oh well funded of course astronomy is

2182.26 --> 2190.7400000000002
not biased by anything it's not actually

2185.65 --> 2190.7400000000002
just no

2206.44 --> 2213.43
the method encoding for his software

2209.17 --> 2216.809
well how about his hardware does he have

2213.43 --> 2221.94
one of these you know the almost robot

2216.809 --> 2224.8590000000004
directed super high-tech telescope thing

2221.94 --> 2228.7000000000003
well it does that cost like a hundred

2224.859 --> 2232.66
thousand dollars or whatever because

2228.7 --> 2240.7889999999998
that makes that suspect exactly in the

2232.66 --> 2244.1499999999996
way that I said if if satellites can

2240.789 --> 2248.92
only be picked up with those types of

2244.15 --> 2253.6600000000003
big rig setups that's that's not good

2248.92 --> 2256.9300000000003
enough it should be anything should be

2253.66 --> 2259.839
able to pick it up if it got sufficient

2256.93 --> 2264.069
lens quality and p900 should absolutely

2259.839 --> 2269.349
be able to pick it up pick something up

2264.069 --> 2274.329
and we don't and technically in a way

2269.349 --> 2276.6090000000004
you should say we shouldn't because yeah

2274.329 --> 2278.799
what kind of light is going to bounce

2276.609 --> 2280.9
off it in order to make it visible at

2278.799 --> 2283.059
night there shouldn't be because this

2280.9 --> 2285.19
Sun is pre supposedly on the other side

2283.059 --> 2287.17
of the earth so there's no sunlight

2285.19 --> 2289.48
reflecting off it so you shouldn't see

2287.17 --> 2293.319
any at night you should see much more

2289.48 --> 2296.95
set up light stuff during the day it's

2293.319 --> 2300.63
many reflections flickering you know how

2296.95 --> 2303.339
far away you can see a mirror reflection

2300.63 --> 2305.26
you know it's been used as a trick to

2303.339 --> 2307.619
communicate you take a mirror it's

2305.26 --> 2310.0890000000004
completely silence you just shine it

2307.619 --> 2312.67
over to where you think the receiver

2310.089 --> 2314.2599999999998
will be and they will see it even though

2312.67 --> 2316.809
it's just a tiny little mirror shard

2314.26 --> 2318.579
miles and miles and miles away well what

2316.809 --> 2321.309
makes you think that we wouldn't see all

2318.579 --> 2325.619
this glimmer of the satellite solar

2321.309 --> 2328.21
panels reflecting the sunlight you know

2325.619 --> 2332.789
during the day and during night why

2328.21 --> 2332.789
would we assume to see any satellites

2337.37 --> 2344.5499999999997
so yeah I'm going by model logic truly

2342.35 --> 2348.21
presupposing it is real what is the

2344.55 --> 2355.6800000000003
consequence what's going to be there you

2348.21 --> 2357.33
know this is well a gem it doesn't have

2355.68 --> 2360.8999999999996
to be a full mirror it can just be a

2357.33 --> 2367.74
mirror shard so that may be more yeah

2360.9 --> 2369.48
you know so even if you show mirror to a

2367.74 --> 2373.16
baller they may shatter it but they can

2369.48 --> 2373.16
still use the shards for the effect

2381.08 --> 2384.17
[Music]

2392.779 --> 2399.019
now he's actually right because my

2395.91 --> 2404.43
hairline has not been receding for a

2399.019 --> 2406.799
long time so yeah flat earth isn't going

2404.43 --> 2412.0989999999997
away just like my hair my hair is here

2406.799 --> 2417.119
to stay it's not super youngster perfect

2412.099 --> 2421.259
but it's its hair it's there it's real

2417.119 --> 2424.049
and it's not going away sorry I know you

2421.259 --> 2426.059
want to fetishize me all shriveling up

2424.049 --> 2427.95
getting old and just dying getting out

2426.059 --> 2431.099
of the way that nasty little Arwen

2427.95 --> 2434.249
always being just blatantly truthful

2431.099 --> 2436.619
direct full and proud at it you must

2434.249 --> 2440.279
hate it so I bet there's just some nasty

2436.619 --> 2443.309
figures that spend a lot of time having

2440.279 --> 2445.799
dark fantasies about me shriveling up or

2443.309 --> 2449.299
something and this receding hairline is

2445.799 --> 2452.13
probably a part of that it's very sad

2449.299 --> 2454.709
especially because it's never gonna

2452.13 --> 2457.559
happen I've already said yeah there may

2454.709 --> 2460.3999999999996
be some further airline recession

2457.559 --> 2464.94
something like that but that's gonna be

2460.4 --> 2467.009
well probably in over 20 years and it's

2464.94 --> 2470.099
gonna be slight it's not gonna be even

2467.009 --> 2471.979
that bad no I will have incredible hair

2470.099 --> 2476.7490000000003
for somebody my age

2471.979 --> 2476.749
okay okay trolley boy

2487.99 --> 2495.9799999999996
all right yeah Karen [ __ ] it's okay you

2493.28 --> 2500.2400000000002
know it is what it is and yeah for

2495.98 --> 2503.36
example if I get very wet then

2500.24 --> 2506.45
eventually my hair my hair is still thin

2503.36 --> 2509.33
it's not like it's not there it's just

2506.45 --> 2512.6899999999996
it's not very thick it doesn't obstruct

2509.33 --> 2514.88
a lot of light but it's by its design

2512.69 --> 2518.03
nature as well this is just the way it

2514.88 --> 2522.23
is so when I get all wet yeah then it it

2518.03 --> 2528.59
you will see my the skin of my head

2522.23 --> 2529.25
where it is not as full and that's kind

2528.59 --> 2531.8
of annoying

2529.25 --> 2533.45
I find it no I find it distracting and

2531.8 --> 2535.19
during the Amsterdam conference yeah

2533.45 --> 2537.23
there were some photos taken of me where

2535.19 --> 2540.43
that was very clearly visible because it

2537.23 --> 2544.39
was pouring outside and I got wet and

2540.43 --> 2546.98
yeah it is what it is I'm you know I

2544.39 --> 2549.2799999999997
can't be all vain about it and say like

2546.98 --> 2553.22
oh no oh no cringe what

2549.28 --> 2557.3
why didn't I love its I'd know it is

2553.22 --> 2559.3999999999996
what it is it doesn't mean that I'm

2557.3 --> 2563.21
wearing a wig or anything it's all my

2559.4 --> 2568.75
hair so yeah you can get over that

2563.21 --> 2568.75
I can get over it

2574.75 --> 2582.05
yeah man talking about personal attacks

2577.64 --> 2588.64
I just watched the vast majority of

2582.05 --> 2591.4100000000003
Patricia stream the Patricia Diaries

2588.64 --> 2595.0099999999998
that's really what it was like over

2591.41 --> 2598.1
three and a half hours of of just

2595.01 --> 2600.32
putting down step-by-step what had

2598.1 --> 2603.7999999999997
transpired in the past and just very

2600.32 --> 2611.3300000000004
vivid I heard most of it in the past

2603.8 --> 2618.9500000000003
bit by bit but but she was just very she

2611.33 --> 2622.43
had a lot of time to really yeah does

2618.95 --> 2625.31
prevent things from rattling do you call

2622.43 --> 2627.68
it just to get more concentrated more

2625.31 --> 2629.36
focused and I appreciate it listening to

2627.68 --> 2634.6099999999997
it she put out some really personal

2629.36 --> 2637.61
details to is like whew okay but yeah I

2634.61 --> 2642.28
was totally in your face honest and I

2637.61 --> 2642.28
thought it was very cool really

2647.88 --> 2654.07
and yeah Patricia is kind of back but

2651.07 --> 2655.69
she's not a well as she says he's not a

2654.07 --> 2658.63
flat earth her anymore I don't know what

2655.69 --> 2662.44
she's gonna do she's just gonna do

2658.63 --> 2664.83
YouTube and yeah we'll see what comes

2662.44 --> 2664.83
from her

2686.96 --> 2692.03
so I've heard septa P she didn't address

2689.839 --> 2694.72
that specifically in this video that I

2692.03 --> 2694.7200000000003
watched but

2710.01 --> 2712.7000000000003
Wow

2713.82 --> 2720.1400000000003
man

2716.369 --> 2720.1400000000003
you know I think it's P Mars

2722.369 --> 2728.699
Pete Mars probably has like post

2726.269 --> 2730.5589999999997
December depression right now probably

2728.699 --> 2737.869
hit him pretty hard he's not been doing

2730.559 --> 2741.559
great but it it sounds like it's him

2737.869 --> 2741.559
now it's not Jason

2747.75 --> 2762.06
that Jason is not pervy P Mars is

2751.82 --> 2766.349
maniacally pervy okay well I don't know

2762.06 --> 2769.07
who it is maybe it's Randy he's equally

2766.349 --> 2769.07
disgusting

2774.88 --> 2778.01
[Music]

2780.12 --> 2786.5499999999997
yeah but yeah I'm not really gonna let

2785.65 --> 2795.04
it ruin anything

2786.55 --> 2799.6800000000003
ah right okay yeah there is gonna be a

2795.04 --> 2799.68
flutter at the Bates yes

2801.46 --> 2804.27
this

2818.68 --> 2822.89
yeah I got a link I don't know when I

2822.26 --> 2828.53
got it

2822.89 --> 2833.15
let me check yeah from Air Wing there

2828.53 --> 2836.8
when Johnson about a I think a Dutch

2833.15 --> 2839.119
astronaut on the on a mainstream

2836.8 --> 2844.3390000000004
newspaper in the Netherlands talking

2839.119 --> 2849.01
about how extraterrestrial life is going

2844.339 --> 2852.0099999999998
to be found within ten years of course

2849.01 --> 2852.01
yeah

2859.22 --> 2866.6189999999997
no more so unless Patricia is not gonna

2861.859 --> 2866.619
be a baller she just doesn't want to be

2867.28 --> 2878.5400000000004
an active truther to that degree because

2873.8 --> 2887.329
it's it's too harsh and just too too

2878.54 --> 2895.609
rough out there and I totally get that

2887.329 --> 2898.04
and yeah even one of the the widest

2895.609 --> 2900.17
problems I always thought is that when

2898.04 --> 2902.23
she was still very active I like I

2900.17 --> 2905.4500000000003
really appreciate the Patricia I've been

2902.23 --> 2906.38
with her on the show like twice or three

2905.45 --> 2918.1699999999996
times or something

2906.38 --> 2920.7400000000002
and who dude right at the Honan don't

2918.17 --> 2926.21
approve a message before you ban it

2920.74 --> 2929.06
sorry but I appreciate it or a great

2926.21 --> 2932.349
deal but even back then it was the

2929.06 --> 2936.5
common kind of obvious that she couldn't

2932.349 --> 2940.15
she was like had a certain social

2936.5 --> 2943.099
approach of like no we like being very

2940.15 --> 2945.619
black-and-white about flat earthers and

2943.099 --> 2949.2200000000003
non flat earthers like we don't in fight

2945.619 --> 2952.46
we don't attack and that didn't turn out

2949.22 --> 2955.8489999999997
to work so well because yeah Flat Earth

2952.46 --> 2959.359
is just has been extremely subjected to

2955.849 --> 2962.06
infighting and the whole range of nasty

2959.359 --> 2964.7599999999998
people are among the flat earthers as

2962.06 --> 2967.88
well and the problem is that doesn't

2964.76 --> 2970.9700000000003
mean that the majority is nasty but

2967.88 --> 2973.19
because of just being in between them in

2970.97 --> 2975.2
the circle being subjected to that level

2973.19 --> 2979.9700000000003
of behavior that shady behavior

2975.2 --> 2982.339
unfortunately rubs off on genuine people

2979.97 --> 2984.7099999999996
that are doing their best it rubs off it

2982.339 --> 2988.31
becomes normalized and it's like an

2984.71 --> 2990.619
infection Savan yay it's the savonia

2988.31 --> 2992.81
infection syndrome it rubs off you cut

2990.619 --> 2994.76
you can't use there

2992.81 --> 3006.21
frequency against them doesn't work that

2994.76 --> 3006.21
way so and yet Patricia just couldn't

3006.9 --> 3012.76
yeah she couldn't handle that that that

3009.67 --> 3015.04
was going on and she didn't want to be a

3012.76 --> 3021.1000000000004
part of it she wanted to stay out of it

3015.04 --> 3024.39
and I don't blame her but it is a bit of

3021.1 --> 3024.39
a disappointment I think

3046.54 --> 3051.42
all right

3048.829 --> 3053.03
well you know what I don't even want to

3051.42 --> 3056.52
go into all that

3053.03 --> 3062.67
Marcel more than theirs but yeah

3056.52 --> 3068.359
basically the issue is is I know other

3062.67 --> 3073.29
people that are like that for example a

3068.359 --> 3076.29
good friend of mine and acts at one

3073.29 --> 3080.339
point that had the kid is over in the

3076.29 --> 3087.329
east of the country like her or the

3080.339 --> 3092.64
father is exactly like exactly like like

3087.329 --> 3095.52
Anthony like an Tonio sorry it's just

3092.64 --> 3098.339
that type and maniacally like that guy

3095.52 --> 3101.7599999999998
is even worse that that guy is no

3098.339 --> 3103.29
control he has no charm to like only

3101.76 --> 3105.349
charm when he's calm down because

3103.29 --> 3108.39
otherwise he's just a demonic

3105.349 --> 3112.819
manipulative nasty maniac to your face

3108.39 --> 3116.04
without shame and now Antonio is not

3112.819 --> 3121.8
that bad he has more a little bit more

3116.04 --> 3126.54
control over himself but it yeah it is

3121.8 --> 3129.8590000000004
kind of the same thing it's just severe

3126.54 --> 3129.859
social behavior

3132.11 --> 3139.67
and always the manipulative not always

3135.08 --> 3139.67
like manipulating out of boredom

3164.569 --> 3167.569
really

3173.8 --> 3178.15
you think sojourn up now you think

3176.14 --> 3180.43
really Nathan Oakley is so incredibly

3178.15 --> 3187.96
toxic I'm not saying that he is perfect

3180.43 --> 3190.39
okay he's not a a knight who attacks

3187.96 --> 3191.58
perfectly with perfect honor oh

3190.39 --> 3195.6099999999997
absolutely not

3191.58 --> 3207.73
but I think that he still has some sense

3195.61 --> 3211.03
of honour at least but yeah Nathan can

3207.73 --> 3215.08
get absolutely brutal but he does

3211.03 --> 3216.9700000000003
typically not overshoot and and that's

3215.08 --> 3220.65
an issue that I sometimes have that I

3216.97 --> 3223.0899999999997
accidentally like get too eager to

3220.65 --> 3224.5
interpret something as an attack and

3223.09 --> 3226.9300000000003
then attack back because it's just

3224.5 --> 3229.69
marriage that can happen it happens

3226.93 --> 3233.0499999999997
sometimes with me and chat here but

3229.69 --> 3237.16
Nathan is very careful with who he

3233.05 --> 3239.4100000000003
berates and like he waits for very

3237.16 --> 3243.7599999999998
specific things to happen in order to

3239.41 --> 3249.7599999999998
he's very methodical and I don't think

3243.76 --> 3252.36
that is toxic at all yeah well turn up

3249.76 --> 3255.61
though the mute button okay

3252.36 --> 3260.53
have you heard me over at Jose's the

3255.61 --> 3264.4300000000003
ball is there they mute me so the mute

3260.53 --> 3268.75
button what is talking about using the

3264.43 --> 3271.12
mute button when Nathan has an important

3268.75 --> 3272.89
point to make and people are just

3271.12 --> 3274.27
distracting away from the train of

3272.89 --> 3280.0
thought from the actual conversation

3274.27 --> 3283.63
from the actual questions then yeah the

3280.0 --> 3287.68
mute button because nobody wants to hear

3283.63 --> 3292.06
all that red herring [ __ ] away from

3287.68 --> 3296.0099999999998
the actual point being made nobody cares

3292.06 --> 3298.72
about the infinite amount of red herring

3296.01 --> 3301.84
distracting nonsense that all ballers

3298.72 --> 3306.5499999999997
can spew out to not respond to questions

3301.84 --> 3307.36
we don't care and I love that Nathan is

3306.55 --> 3312.19
merciless

3307.36 --> 3314.92
with that [ __ ] because his show is the

3312.19 --> 3317.59
time in the place for that and ballers

3314.92 --> 3320.35
keep coming they keep coming to keep on

3317.59 --> 3322.3900000000003
lining up it's not like oh my god nathan

3320.35 --> 3326.04
is cornering people no those are people

3322.39 --> 3334.18
that are coming on his show buddy so

3326.04 --> 3336.58
toxic so toxic ooh yeah John up though

3334.18 --> 3340.96
yeah he damn well needs to call people

3336.58 --> 3344.52
names and get pretty savage and get very

3340.96 --> 3348.48
rough and overemphasized a little bit

3344.52 --> 3352.11
cartoon of I because people are behaving

3348.48 --> 3352.11
cartoonishly idiotic

3364.089 --> 3368.869
Hey

3365.869 --> 3371.9
if that is your fetish Hey Jorn up

3368.869 --> 3374.15
though if you know how creepy that

3371.9 --> 3377.15
really sounds when you say that that

3374.15 --> 3381.829
Jordan Abdo would rather watch an edited

3377.15 --> 3385.069
Holocaust videos right then watching

3381.829 --> 3387.4990000000003
Nathan Oakley's because apparently he's

3385.069 --> 3391.219
fine with that doesn't find that

3387.499 --> 3394.549
absolutely beyond human horrific and

3391.219 --> 3398.809
creepy and mysterious and like what the

3394.549 --> 3402.68
hell really happened over there okay but

3398.809 --> 3404.69
I guess that he just has no problem with

3402.68 --> 3408.249
that as long as he doesn't hear Nathan

3404.69 --> 3412.39
actually being brutally to the point and

3408.249 --> 3415.39
pacifying is spiraling out of control

3412.39 --> 3415.39
opponents

3431.299 --> 3436.669
yeah I think it's really creepy I'd

3433.729 --> 3439.189
rather watch Nathan Oakley go out of

3436.669 --> 3441.3799999999997
control and even be mean in a way that

3439.189 --> 3443.6589999999997
hurts me because sometimes he gods does

3441.38 --> 3446.599
go too far and it hurts me but I can't

3443.659 --> 3448.789
step in I don't know what to do about it

3446.599 --> 3451.309
like sports chemo and [ __ ] does that

3448.789 --> 3454.989
yeah what happens then he gets attacked

3451.309 --> 3457.63
and he gets in total opponent mode I

3454.989 --> 3460.189
don't want to go there Nathan knows

3457.63 --> 3463.429
Nathan knows when he goes too far and I

3460.189 --> 3466.699
do tell him I do tell him but afterwards

3463.429 --> 3474.009
because if he's in the rage moment yeah

3466.699 --> 3474.009
he's not gonna be stopped so

3477.76 --> 3487.3300000000004
oh you hate it but still you'd rather

3481.15 --> 3489.58
watch that then just hear Nathan being

3487.33 --> 3492.31
very savage towards people that are

3489.58 --> 3496.93
acting like absolute [ __ ] religious

3492.31 --> 3497.32
zealot buffoons well hey to each their

3496.93 --> 3499.8689999999997
own

3497.32 --> 3502.9900000000002
I think there's a lot of people that

3499.869 --> 3507.19
actually think it is interesting and

3502.99 --> 3508.2999999999997
sometimes hilarious and a bit like maybe

3507.19 --> 3512.7400000000002
he went a bit too far

3508.3 --> 3515.92
I don't know but yeah I don't see it as

3512.74 --> 3519.49
absolutely disgusting absolutely not

3515.92 --> 3523.3
only a religious [ __ ] that would

3519.49 --> 3524.83
refuse to let sink in in their mind what

3523.3 --> 3526.2400000000002
is actually transpiring what the

3524.83 --> 3529.27
conversation is actually about what the

3526.24 --> 3532.1189999999997
arguments are but just say all no no the

3529.27 --> 3534.31
behavior look the bay the bay just look

3532.119 --> 3536.9500000000003
at the behavior don't talk about the

3534.31 --> 3541.27
behavior yeah that's that's what

3536.95 --> 3544.0899999999997
religious politicized fanatics do don't

3541.27 --> 3546.0099999999998
look at the arguments they just look at

3544.09 --> 3547.54
the behavior and then they all they make

3546.01 --> 3549.9100000000003
a little thing about that all the

3547.54 --> 3552.07
behavior in the hopes that people will

3549.91 --> 3553.8999999999996
just forget about all that arrest so the

3552.07 --> 3556.69
actual arguments the thing that was

3553.9 --> 3560.4700000000003
really going on Oh

3556.69 --> 3564.28
the behavior so bad oh god Nathan is

3560.47 --> 3567.85
such a monster so many so mean so mean

3564.28 --> 3572.0800000000004
to people that refuse to answer

3567.85 --> 3574.66
yes/no questions for half an hour yet

3572.08 --> 3578.3199999999997
they will still talk to red herring away

3574.66 --> 3581.77
from it but they cannot say yes cannot

3578.32 --> 3585.4900000000002
say no because they're religious zealots

3581.77 --> 3588.1
and they're there to waste everybody's

3585.49 --> 3591.7299999999996
time and to make sure that people don't

3588.1 --> 3597.63
get to hear a straight answer because

3591.73 --> 3599.77
that's not in their advantage so anyway

3597.63 --> 3602.81
yeah

3599.77 --> 3606.65
I'm gonna run out the show the first

3602.81 --> 3613.21
show of 2020 on the Arwen channel fire

3606.65 --> 3618.62
early word so yeah Nathan's gone live

3613.21 --> 3623.33
think Randy's life so I'm gonna get over

3618.62 --> 3625.31
there thanks everyone for coming

3623.33 --> 3627.59
if you like the show please don't forget

3625.31 --> 3630.83
to upload it I get a barrage of troll

3627.59 --> 3634.7000000000003
downloads and it would be nice if people

3630.83 --> 3638.54
really tried really tried to help me out

3634.7 --> 3641.5699999999997
because look right now I got 31

3638.54 --> 3649.2799999999997
downloads before I even started the show

3641.57 --> 3652.5800000000004
it was minus five okay so I kinda need

3649.28 --> 3654.9500000000003
your wait it's not I'm not settling with

3652.58 --> 3657.35
just ignoring it turning off the views

3654.95 --> 3659.2999999999997
on that now I really need people to

3657.35 --> 3660.92
actually do that even though it seems

3659.3 --> 3664.4
pointless because it is rigged and

3660.92 --> 3669.86
that's that's why I need your up vote I

3664.4 --> 3672.4700000000003
need it's very serious up folded because

3669.86 --> 3676.04
I'm literally being socially ostracized

3672.47 --> 3680.6299999999997
by YouTube's algorithm and I need the

3676.04 --> 3682.94
weight to offset what they want me to

3680.63 --> 3687.8
look like like a guy that barely has any

3682.94 --> 3690.17
views that everybody hates that's what

3687.8 --> 3693.77
they want it to look like on the surface

3690.17 --> 3696.11
and I need all of your help to stop that

3693.77 --> 3698.75
it's very important double check it

3696.11 --> 3702.86
double check it because it gets squared

3698.75 --> 3705.62
away go back to the video again and up

3702.86 --> 3711.73
fold it and you make sure that you

3705.62 --> 3714.2
