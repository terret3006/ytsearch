65.979 --> 78.71
good to see ya so this morning it is

72.67 --> 82.36
different again it it's blowing the wind

78.71 --> 85.39999999999999
is blowing pretty much constantly now

82.36 --> 89.0
there's some really big clouds in

85.4 --> 97.039
between all that look you can literally

89.0 --> 101.149
see the clouds just moving see and and

97.039 --> 102.649
this is relatively a still moment where

101.149 --> 104.929
the wind is kind of constant because

102.649 --> 107.36
sometimes it just gets ripping and you

104.929 --> 110.99000000000001
see the tree shaking from the force of

107.36 --> 117.679
it all that gas pressure all being

110.99 --> 119.24
redistributed I guess there's some

117.679 --> 123.259
people out there that just don't sense

119.24 --> 127.83999999999999
it no matter what anyway yeah heavy

123.259 --> 127.84
weather is still kind of nice and warm

128.229 --> 137.59
if you don't get caught out in the rain

132.4 --> 148.18
so today I got with me Tamera coffee and

137.59 --> 152.45
tea and that's it I had I had a

148.18 --> 156.44
iluminati croissant before but it was

152.45 --> 159.319
too good so I didn't I had it at 1

156.44 --> 161.06
o'clock it was supposed to save it but I

159.319 --> 164.20999999999998
got just too hungry so I ate it

161.06 --> 170.51
sorry was really good though

164.21 --> 174.5
hmm and weirdly enough this is my second

170.51 --> 177.67999999999998
cup of coffee in an hour because I

174.5 --> 179.48
didn't take coffee in the morning it was

177.68 --> 183.14000000000001
quite pleasant actually not taking

179.48 --> 187.45
coffee in the morning and just tea but

183.14 --> 190.27999999999997
then I felt like yeah I want the coffee

187.45 --> 193.33999999999997
and then after I was done I wanted some

190.28 --> 195.08
more so I got this and I'm gonna drink

193.34 --> 197.48
it a little bit more slowly because I'm

195.08 --> 200.69000000000003
still kind of filled up on coffee so now

197.48 --> 209.63
I'm just not gonna ghusl it up like

200.69 --> 213.5
usually so that's using chat hm of

209.63 --> 215.47
course Amanda young de lisle IO Jason

213.5 --> 222.64
McCormack's Sara

215.47 --> 226.32999999999998
Sarita Cosentino more colored is McLeod

222.64 --> 226.32999999999998
yeah good to see you

228.17 --> 239.98999999999998
so what is happening gaiz mm-hmm this

238.13 --> 244.03
time I actually went to bed pretty late

239.99 --> 247.38
but I was just hanging around watching

244.03 --> 250.09
stuff Low Energy

247.38 --> 254.989
[Music]

250.09 --> 258.44
alright yeah coffee does give me much

254.989 --> 262.16
more of a kick but it also has an impact

258.44 --> 264.919
on my stomach and it's not always useful

262.16 --> 270.98
while tea I can't basically keep on

264.919 --> 274.18
drinking unless it's too warmed and just

270.98 --> 274.18
not pleasant to do that

278.639 --> 285.06
so if I've been missing

289.34 --> 298.76
right yeah I hit the 1,400 this morning

293.49 --> 298.76
but now it's going back again so just

299.03 --> 309.28999999999996
like I predicted oh yeah I enroll media

304.32 --> 309.29
was life I caught a few snippets but

313.04 --> 321.81
ending any of you guys get catch the

316.14 --> 324.93
after shell I didn't catch it but yeah I

321.81 --> 328.07
was part of it so it was good to hear

324.93 --> 328.07
some feedback on that

334.21 --> 336.78
huh

343.35 --> 354.20000000000005
wait yeah what what was that

348.63 --> 359.15
what I saw ace MacLeod were you on on

354.2 --> 362.4
iron raw media yesterday I thought I

359.15 --> 364.40999999999997
recognized I thought I recognized you it

362.4 --> 374.06
just didn't expect to see you with those

364.41 --> 374.06
other two with you

375.98 --> 379.94
is anyone still there

388.1 --> 398.12
yes Saturday side Sarita goes in Tino I

394.82 --> 401.51
have no idea but they're they're just

398.12 --> 405.67
keeping out and pushing it it seems as I

401.51 --> 410.92
originally predicted it seems I can

405.67 --> 414.62
deliberate the railing attempts to

410.92 --> 417.38
distract people to to get them caught up

414.62 --> 420.74
in in this red herring

417.38 --> 424.55
just like the glow bears have used their

420.74 --> 428.66
own question deflection system and red

424.55 --> 431.3
herring stories to keep the flat

428.66 --> 434.15000000000003
earthers occupied with that [ __ ] instead

431.3 --> 436.73
of making progress and it seems like I

434.15 --> 439.7
think it started with spurts Kimo

436.73 --> 442.13
probably and there's probably some

439.7 --> 446.02
ballers in the background scheming at it

442.13 --> 449.57
as well so I don't know why they did it

446.02 --> 453.72999999999996
social experiment maybe or genuine

449.57 --> 457.09999999999997
discovery but their whole method is not

453.73 --> 459.08000000000004
it's not gonna lead to discovery it is

457.1 --> 460.82000000000005
covering up something so they're

459.08 --> 469.01
covering something that it's never gonna

460.82 --> 471.08
work out and it's very obvious and I

469.01 --> 473.87
don't know how how long it will keep it

471.08 --> 478.06
up and everyone else is that is sticking

473.87 --> 478.06
to that weird train of thought

479.43 --> 491.59000000000003
[Music]

480.74 --> 496.40000000000003
I just find it really tiresome now so

491.59 --> 499.28
yeah a little weird maybe but I dropped

496.4 --> 503.53
a message at Brenda in Skype

499.28 --> 506.53999999999996
she's been like well pretty much whining

503.53 --> 507.91999999999996
comes to yes she wins a lot in my chat

506.54 --> 510.65000000000003
Kenny please come on Kenny please come

507.92 --> 515.57
on can I please come on but I thought

510.65 --> 518.12
well I did watch her going berserk last

515.57 --> 527.5100000000001
time and I think she probably just needs

518.12 --> 529.82
a place where she can yeah or she can

527.51 --> 536.21
calmly reflect back on it and I kind of

529.82 --> 539.1800000000001
like to hear if there's anything to her

536.21 --> 546.5600000000001
side of the story that that she hasn't

539.18 --> 549.8299999999999
revealed yet but I think that as long as

546.56 --> 550.28
yeah she just needs to talk about it for

549.83 --> 554.2700000000001
a moment

550.28 --> 559.1899999999999
maybe and then after that she can just

554.27 --> 561.0799999999999
put it to rest as an incident but I

559.19 --> 563.9000000000001
thought it was kind of interesting

561.08 --> 566.08
though interesting I wonder how she

563.9 --> 569.05
thinks about it now but she got all

566.08 --> 572.12
pissed off at Randy during that hangout

569.05 --> 576.02
saying that he set this all up to happen

572.12 --> 577.64
and I wonder if she still thinks that or

576.02 --> 584.1999999999999
if it was just the paranoid of the

577.64 --> 584.1999999999999
moment because I wouldn't be surprised

592.93 --> 600.2199999999999
hmm hey that one guy

596.03 --> 600.22
Karen be pumpkin

606.19 --> 609.339
[Music]

618.32 --> 623.2900000000001
yeah hey if anyone else wants to join me

623.8 --> 633.9799999999999
I'm open for a chat hello reckoner

628.04 --> 639.759
Stefan hey listen it is a Saturday after

633.98 --> 639.759
all yeah

688.69 --> 696.37
right oh by the way let's get back into

692.11 --> 699.67
some issues look currently I seem to be

696.37 --> 701.319
caught up in a web of all these people

699.67 --> 703.959
that I've been dealing with that are

701.319 --> 706.36
making choices and are changing the

703.959 --> 709.2689999999999
scene as it were and I feel a little

706.36 --> 713.019
caught up in it sometimes so I wonder if

709.269 --> 717.91
you guys think that my responses are

713.019 --> 727.199
appropriate because I'm being very

717.91 --> 727.199
defensive but I do it because I just I

728.31 --> 733.7199999999999
just feel the corrupting effect

731.199 --> 736.8389999999999
sometimes the corrupted decisions and

733.72 --> 742.36
that they're not accidents you know

736.839 --> 744.519
somebody can by accident build a broken

742.36 --> 746.769
train of thought or something and then

744.519 --> 748.449
after a while they may figure it out or

746.769 --> 752.5
somebody may point at it like wait you

748.449 --> 754.269
made a mistake here and then oops but I

752.5 --> 756.16
don't think that's really happening and

754.269 --> 763.12
considering the whole weird no gas

756.16 --> 768.06
pressure situation and and then there is

763.12 --> 768.0600000000001
the whole issue with ranty because I

768.87 --> 775.0600000000001
look the guy is very ambitious obviously

772.389 --> 778.72
but I think that though it's more

775.06 --> 780.79
ambitious than I am but I don't know

778.72 --> 782.889
what it is maybe it is because the way I

780.79 --> 789.43
am and the way he is and then we had

782.889 --> 795.5790000000001
contact he now just feels the need to

789.43 --> 800.829
really poke at me to to put me down as

795.579 --> 803.2299999999999
it were he wants to be higher on the

800.829 --> 809.8499999999999
ladder than me and he is really trying

803.23 --> 812.74
to manifest that as he goes I feel and

809.85 --> 815.3190000000001
the problem is is because of my openness

812.74 --> 818.91
I am kind of viable to this but I need a

815.319 --> 818.91
way out of this situation

820.69 --> 828.149
other than just being as honest and

824.069 --> 831.55
gentlemanly as I can and when I have to

828.149 --> 834.22
get some outburst and then limit the

831.55 --> 836.1099999999999
damage as much as much as possible learn

834.22 --> 841.5400000000001
from it that's what I try to do but it's

836.11 --> 845.8290000000001
I don't see this changing and I feel

841.54 --> 849.069
Randi is really trying to go for the top

845.829 --> 853.9799999999999
layer as it were he's networking he's

849.069 --> 856.829
just threes off how do you say from a

853.98 --> 860.019
ambitious standpoint I get I guess I

856.829 --> 862.6289999999999
guess you could say he is kind of

860.019 --> 868.35
crushing it so when Benjamin would put

862.629 --> 879.04
it it's just that the attitude he chose

868.35 --> 881.4300000000001
to wield for that is just it comes with

879.04 --> 881.43
a price

884.64 --> 889.86
I just can't believe he did that as it

887.67 --> 893.579
were and he can't believe that I

889.86 --> 895.5
wouldn't do that and that bridge is

893.579 --> 898.079
something that I just don't think can be

895.5 --> 902.42
overcome really because he's just gonna

898.079 --> 906.329
Ram it to me like Darwin Darwin you know

902.42 --> 908.6999999999999
always all the ideas and everything but

906.329 --> 911.31
you seem to be afraid to do this and

908.7 --> 913.529
afraid to do that and why don't you just

911.31 --> 913.8
try to get a job again and blah blah

913.529 --> 916.17
blah

913.8 --> 918.66
and he even before he started to use

916.17 --> 922.01
this as a as a weapon in public to

918.66 --> 924.8389999999999
humiliate needed this pretty genuinely

922.01 --> 927.81
face to face and calls and I would

924.839 --> 932.19
explain it to him what how that works

927.81 --> 935.64
for me and that I am quite unusual in

932.19 --> 939.9300000000001
how I approach things it's something

935.64 --> 944.579
that has has benefits as well it's quite

939.93 --> 949.649
unique and that the the niche approach

944.579 --> 951.899
is kind of valuable because nobody out

949.649 --> 956.31
there is gonna be crazy enough to try

951.899 --> 958.35
something like this what I do unless

956.31 --> 963.51
they are literally throwing everything

958.35 --> 966.9200000000001
overboard it's as I said it's quite

963.51 --> 966.92
unusual what I'm doing

975.16 --> 985.48
but at the same time I do feel a need

979.39 --> 988.18
that as an ebony tree as I basically as

985.48 --> 992.95
my icon you know you know the one how

988.18 --> 997.2399999999999
many trees are very slow very strong but

992.95 --> 1004.23
they do grow so I've been doing early

997.24 --> 1008.97
bird for a long time now yeah eight

1004.23 --> 1010.74
months and I feel that there needs to be

1008.97 --> 1013.98
something more and I've been thinking

1010.74 --> 1016.05
about it maybe I've already been getting

1013.98 --> 1020.4300000000001
offers for help and everything for

1016.05 --> 1023.6099999999999
people like maybe I could try to upgrade

1020.43 --> 1026.6699999999998
the early bird show into a better

1023.61 --> 1030.93
version without getting all too noisy

1026.67 --> 1035.959
and attention grabby still upgraded and

1030.93 --> 1038.91
but try to keep the same consistency

1035.959 --> 1040.77
because I don't need like a

1038.91 --> 1043.709
metamorphosis like oh I need to

1040.77 --> 1049.25
completely reinvent myself because the

1043.709 --> 1052.79
old thing is asked to go liberal way no

1049.25 --> 1056.49
I'd rather see it as a neck the

1052.79 --> 1059.57
expanding of a house just need a couple

1056.49 --> 1066.75
of more rooms more opportunities more

1059.57 --> 1073.1
connections and I'm open for ideas but

1066.75 --> 1073.1
at the same time it's not yeah

1073.96 --> 1078.8400000000001
what I hope for earlier is just to get

1076.299 --> 1082.24
the right people that I feel good about

1078.84 --> 1085.779
hoping that they would try to engage and

1082.24 --> 1087.909
see what they could do and if that

1085.779 --> 1092.259
requires a lot of talk in the background

1087.909 --> 1096.669
and a lot of very tough questions which

1092.259 --> 1098.98
I totally expect then I'm absolutely

1096.669 --> 1101.6490000000001
good for that you know I'd rather have

1098.98 --> 1105.22
tough questions from people that I know

1101.649 --> 1107.619
are studied in the same directions as I

1105.22 --> 1113.8600000000001
am and they're they're very like-minded

1107.619 --> 1117.999
in many ways and yeah have my feelings

1113.86 --> 1122.11
touched or tested by them then to go out

1117.999 --> 1125.08
to some random corporation and yeah

1122.11 --> 1127.029
and salute try to humiliate and enslave

1125.08 --> 1129.629
myself to become some kind of drone in

1127.029 --> 1135.389
order to get a slightly higher income

1129.629 --> 1135.389
which I'll be eaten away as I go anyway

1138.749 --> 1144.659
okay down hum well you don't have to

1142.09 --> 1147.4599999999998
unsubscribe for that you can just and

1144.659 --> 1152.409
hit the bail notification if you're

1147.46 --> 1155.08
bothered by daily notifications you know

1152.409 --> 1157.2990000000002
I recommend you do that you do hit the

1155.08 --> 1159.85
bail notification but if it's if it's

1157.299 --> 1163.6589999999999
gonna bother you then just and hit it

1159.85 --> 1168.61
and also you can go into your YouTube

1163.659 --> 1170.95
YouTube account and change the daily

1168.61 --> 1173.7099999999998
notification settings you can turn it

1170.95 --> 1176.6490000000001
off entirely so you really have to dig

1173.71 --> 1178.8990000000001
into YouTube itself in order to see what

1176.649 --> 1181.4089999999999
what has been notified so it's up to you

1178.899 --> 1181.4089999999999
don't hub

1185.27 --> 1192.07
[Music]

1188.1 --> 1194.74
yes yes AGM you did tell me a lot of

1192.07 --> 1203.05
people have told me a lot of things that

1194.74 --> 1207.64
were sensible problem with me is there

1203.05 --> 1209.98
and this is almost like a personal

1207.64 --> 1212.5900000000001
function frequency issue I feel

1209.98 --> 1215.53
sometimes that is the downside of what I

1212.59 --> 1219.9399999999998
do and that is I see a lot of things

1215.53 --> 1224.08
coming that most people really don't see

1219.94 --> 1226.8400000000001
but it's not it's almost impossible or

1224.08 --> 1230.4399999999998
useless just to work with that I can

1226.84 --> 1232.8999999999999
only help build people up to prepare for

1230.44 --> 1235.3600000000001
it for when it's gonna come and at the

1232.9 --> 1241.39
same time people have very practical

1235.36 --> 1243.6299999999999
advice but me I'm very slow and I it's

1241.39 --> 1247.0900000000001
not very apparent but I am really

1243.63 --> 1249.5800000000002
juggling with some very delicate

1247.09 --> 1253.78
energies in the background in my soul

1249.58 --> 1255.82
and I have to be very careful with the

1253.78 --> 1258.04
decisions of what I'm gonna try out what

1255.82 --> 1259.57
I'm gonna do because of what could

1258.04 --> 1263.53
happen

1259.57 --> 1265.84
if I try a lot of new things I can get

1263.53 --> 1267.66
extremely nervous for example and I

1265.84 --> 1271.9299999999998
learned to deal with that but if I

1267.66 --> 1274.45
overdo it if I keep on like no more more

1271.93 --> 1279.0
and more than eventually it's literally

1274.45 --> 1285.88
gonna rupture also because I've just

1279.0 --> 1289.0
never I never successfully grind it in

1285.88 --> 1294.99
that way for me the best results in my

1289.0 --> 1298.11
entire life always come out of mm-hmm

1294.99 --> 1300.82
stop it our way and just stop being so

1298.11 --> 1304.0
anxious and wanting things immediately

1300.82 --> 1309.22
and just look at it and be patient

1304.0 --> 1311.47
become and be in the right energy for

1309.22 --> 1313.81
when the opportunity arrives and then it

1311.47 --> 1314.909
will just click and that's how

1313.81 --> 1318.52
everything

1314.909 --> 1320.679
has always worked out somehow very

1318.52 --> 1323.44
elusively for the inn for my intellect

1320.679 --> 1327.7
but that has always worked so because of

1323.44 --> 1329.8600000000001
that that is what I've rely on it works

1327.7 --> 1335.2
I survive on that but at the same time

1329.86 --> 1338.35
my growth pace in my personal pragmatic

1335.2 --> 1340.75
life is slowly like an ebony tree it's

1338.35 --> 1343.9289999999999
slowly so all that great advice it's all

1340.75 --> 1345.549
great but I can't assimilate it yet it

1343.929 --> 1348.039
just has to lay on the ground be

1345.549 --> 1351.22
absorbed and then gradually as my roots

1348.039 --> 1368.279
slowly expand I'll reach that and I'll

1351.22 --> 1374.3500000000001
be able to finally apply it so yep Frank

1368.279 --> 1383.44
but I don't know it's just me it I think

1374.35 --> 1385.84
that it is like it is not the norm I am

1383.44 --> 1388.929
NOT the norm how I function how I do

1385.84 --> 1390.85
things I absolutely don't expect others

1388.929 --> 1395.6490000000001
to do it like that at all

1390.85 --> 1398.4399999999998
I actually recommend against it unless

1395.649 --> 1402.6689999999999
you have the long-term inside and you

1398.44 --> 1405.46
really know how to wield the benefits

1402.669 --> 1410.289
that do come from living this way have

1405.46 --> 1413.44
to really be prepared because there's a

1410.289 --> 1416.49
lot of damage that will come and most

1413.44 --> 1420.69
people break under that

1416.49 --> 1423.32
I barely held together under it and I've

1420.69 --> 1432.8700000000001
been trying to work away this car

1423.32 --> 1435.57
psychologically for decades so yeah a

1432.87 --> 1437.6999999999998
lot of people will take easy ways out

1435.57 --> 1438.4199999999998
and just be pragmatic oh this works oh

1437.7 --> 1441.51
wait

1438.42 --> 1445.98
statistics blip cache bang click click

1441.51 --> 1449.61
clock let's go let's grow and whoo

1445.98 --> 1451.02
everything's just great except for the

1449.61 --> 1453.12
side effects that Sully you're

1451.02 --> 1455.43
confronted with a lot of people that are

1453.12 --> 1458.2399999999998
just like that and that are trying to

1455.43 --> 1461.28
manipulate you aggravate you that you

1458.24 --> 1463.5
explode but then you of course can use

1461.28 --> 1467.81
everything can be used when you're

1463.5 --> 1470.58
ambitious so victim position can be used

1467.81 --> 1472.29
victory position can be used everything

1470.58 --> 1474.72
can be used so everything is going to be

1472.29 --> 1477.98
used and eventually there's not going to

1474.72 --> 1480.93
be any more room for the natural

1477.98 --> 1483.9
expression of feelings it's all gonna be

1480.93 --> 1486.0
contained and used and financialized

1483.9 --> 1489.75
everything everything about the person

1486.0 --> 1492.2
that's what really ambitious people end

1489.75 --> 1492.2
up with

1495.5 --> 1503.059
and it is really tough to imagine what

1499.97 --> 1514.28
that is like when it becomes more easy

1503.059 --> 1518.049
to act feelings for exploitation then to

1514.28 --> 1518.049
just feel what it is to be human

1523.539 --> 1532.849
so just saying this is in general you

1529.879 --> 1536.2099999999998
know the success of ambition is very

1532.849 --> 1539.119
obvious very visible but the

1536.21 --> 1547.009
consequences are also if you see how

1539.119 --> 1552.049
that works and it is explainable it is

1547.009 --> 1554.749
not a mystery you don't have to put some

1552.049 --> 1557.389
kind of evil or good over no you can

1554.749 --> 1559.999
just look at the pragmatic effects at

1557.389 --> 1561.4399999999998
the chain of communications of the

1559.999 --> 1563.749
people you're going to be deal with

1561.44 --> 1565.7
dealing with of who's gonna be seeing

1563.749 --> 1567.619
you and what is going to change about

1565.7 --> 1571.759
everything surrounding if you have some

1567.619 --> 1579.009
kind of insight on how that works then

1571.759 --> 1579.009
you'll see how it will happen and why

1581.2 --> 1585.529
but you have to look because if you

1584.21 --> 1587.33
don't know how to look if you don't

1585.529 --> 1589.339
really know how to look beyond the

1587.33 --> 1591.259
moment you'll just be looking from the

1589.339 --> 1593.869
side and seeing wow these people are so

1591.259 --> 1598.879
successful Wow they got cameras on them

1593.869 --> 1601.1589999999999
every time they Wow they seem so in

1598.879 --> 1603.9789999999998
there in that in the mood and they're

1601.159 --> 1605.5990000000002
crushing and they're awesome and you

1603.979 --> 1608.6290000000001
don't really see everything else that

1605.599 --> 1611.029
goes on when they because the more you

1608.629 --> 1612.859
learn the more you figure out there just

1611.029 --> 1615.849
playing dirty games all the time and

1612.859 --> 1615.849
manipulating [ __ ]

1623.82 --> 1627.049
and that's just natural

1635.99 --> 1655.02
hmm man coffee does really give me a

1643.11 --> 1656.9399999999998
boost noticeably every time for some

1655.02 --> 1659.52
reason that every time I get to Mara

1656.94 --> 1662.0700000000002
coffee and I drink it and I don't feel

1659.52 --> 1665.58
sick or anything I get on these long

1662.07 --> 1669.4189999999999
trains that just put the rails down

1665.58 --> 1671.6589999999999
really far and wide and clear I like

1669.419 --> 1671.659
that

1681.19 --> 1683.8790000000001
yeah

1691.28 --> 1713.06
yeah maybe not use my chat for that

1695.99 --> 1718.24
Jeffrey bill thanks so anyway that's my

1713.06 --> 1722.1499999999999
little talk about ambition how it works

1718.24 --> 1729.5
the fruits and the poisons and then

1722.15 --> 1737.99
there is the I said yeah they did the

1729.5 --> 1740.53
the lonely path or the avoiding path

1737.99 --> 1748.45
that's what I seem to be doing mostly

1740.53 --> 1748.45
just I I don't want to get caught up in

1748.69 --> 1755.0900000000001
chiseling at my spirit chiseling at what

1753.02 --> 1757.07
I'm building here just to get a little

1755.09 --> 1760.24
bit more money because that's a sliding

1757.07 --> 1764.21
slope once you start everything goes and

1760.24 --> 1767.54
why well not because you don't see it

1764.21 --> 1771.05
but because other people out there are

1767.54 --> 1772.97
hollowed out and they just want when

1771.05 --> 1775.94
they see somebody that's not done that

1772.97 --> 1778.58
yet and that is hungry for money they

1775.94 --> 1780.2
just won naturally it's the demon inside

1778.58 --> 1782.4499999999998
because that comes from the vault just

1780.2 --> 1784.9
wants them to just get it over with and

1782.45 --> 1789.14
just get it out of the way so they will

1784.9 --> 1790.8500000000001
amplify that sacrifice just people in

1789.14 --> 1793.97
the hierarchy that don't really have any

1790.85 --> 1798.76
real power they will just try to push

1793.97 --> 1803.29
you to humiliate yourself unnecessarily

1798.76 --> 1803.29
even further that happens

1809.18 --> 1817.01
god I don't want your uh I don't want

1814.04 --> 1819.4099999999999
what you got to offer conspiracy catch

1817.01 --> 1822.8
look I already had you on my show one

1819.41 --> 1824.8400000000001
time twice I don't remember I would I

1822.8 --> 1827.06
wouldn't even mind at some point to have

1824.84 --> 1833.02
you back on again but you gotta stop

1827.06 --> 1833.02
this stupid manipulation [ __ ] okay I

1833.05 --> 1839.57
just did an entire speech basically

1835.85 --> 1844.4299999999998
about ambition and the issues of it

1839.57 --> 1846.6499999999999
and what I do this just blatantly

1844.43 --> 1849.16
obvious that you didn't listen to a word

1846.65 --> 1849.16
I said

1865.12 --> 1875.29
: turner hey hello you say awful scenes

1870.04 --> 1877.33
of Brenda baiting what is that Wow I did

1875.29 --> 1883.1499999999999
look I don't follow

1877.33 --> 1884.5
Randy anymore for the same reasons why I

1883.15 --> 1889.51
don't follow

1884.5 --> 1898.42
Tim Osmond anymore suprise remarkably

1889.51 --> 1902.64
similar reasons really wow it's even a

1898.42 --> 1902.64
long time ago that I remember that name

1913.55 --> 1925.25
hey if you really want to friendly help

1919.64 --> 1929.24
me out then why don't you just say

1925.25 --> 1932.99
something good about me or maybe point

1929.24 --> 1935.57
out that I have integrity concerning the

1932.99 --> 1937.79
whole scientific issue and the debates

1935.57 --> 1941.48
and cosmogony and that I do have

1937.79 --> 1943.76
understanding of the globe model and

1941.48 --> 1946.04
even of the psychology behind it because

1943.76 --> 1949.37
I talk about it a lot and I can

1946.04 --> 1952.09
entertain globe believers I think

1949.37 --> 1954.9199999999998
personally like nobody else out there I

1952.09 --> 1958.58
when I go into a conversation even with

1954.92 --> 1962.0600000000002
people like rumpus I don't actually try

1958.58 --> 1964.8799999999999
to manipulate them on the spot and

1962.06 --> 1967.55
that's very difficult for a lot of

1964.88 --> 1969.7700000000002
flat-earthers not to do because the

1967.55 --> 1972.47
globus manipulate them so why wouldn't

1969.77 --> 1975.26
they do it back well I don't because I

1972.47 --> 1979.28
want that manipulation out of the way so

1975.26 --> 1982.67
if you want to promote me share the

1979.28 --> 1984.59
qualities that I have that'll really

1982.67 --> 1987.71
help that'll actually help if you show

1984.59 --> 1991.2099999999998
that a you're supposedly a problem globo

1987.71 --> 1993.97
or whatever channel show them that

1991.21 --> 2002.2
there's flat-earthers out there that

1993.97 --> 2006.51
aren't just weirdos maniacs that are

2002.2 --> 2008.89
actually gentlemen like maybe you

2006.51 --> 2010.54
everybody has a dark side at times you

2008.89 --> 2011.8600000000001
know everybody can get really pissed off

2010.54 --> 2014.44
no exceptions

2011.86 --> 2016.9299999999998
what I try to do my best and be honest

2014.44 --> 2017.5900000000001
and be polite and all that promote me

2016.93 --> 2022.93
that way

2017.59 --> 2026.52
or hey if you want to get straight to to

2022.93 --> 2026.52
the bottom of it you can also donate

2034.71 --> 2037.64
okay

2038.85 --> 2045.51
I don't see why you needed to do that

2041.87 --> 2048.62
the one I was kind of in the middle of a

2045.51 --> 2048.62
conversation with him

2064.38 --> 2068.429
[Music]

2071.98 --> 2077.81
it's all fun you know he's not being

2074.87 --> 2081.7999999999997
really he stopped asking for a wrench at

2077.81 --> 2094.34
least so just trying to wiggle his way

2081.8 --> 2097.88
through and right if he genuinely wants

2094.34 --> 2100.67
to help which are kind of doubt then now

2097.88 --> 2104.51
don't go there or I'm gonna ban you

2100.67 --> 2107.87
after all so don't go getting yourself

2104.51 --> 2116.2900000000004
in a catfight in my chat thank you very

2107.87 --> 2120.14
much oh okay yeah apparently you did

2116.29 --> 2125.72
okay well cats apparently the one did

2120.14 --> 2127.3399999999997
something by mistake maybe he wanted to

2125.72 --> 2130.48
check out your channel and then

2127.34 --> 2130.48
accidentally hit it

2144.38 --> 2147.53
all right

2152.95 --> 2164.31
uh-uh okay I can explain how you saw

2161.83 --> 2168.85
earth Kurth with your own eyes you

2164.31 --> 2172.27
didn't you saw horizon and then your

2168.85 --> 2174.67
mind reflected back upon stories that

2172.27 --> 2179.23
people told you that that is supposedly

2174.67 --> 2182.08
the edge of a curve of the earth so you

2179.23 --> 2184.66
didn't see the curve you just thought

2182.08 --> 2188.37
you did based on what people told you

2184.66 --> 2188.37
that that is supposed to be

2200.35 --> 2202.89
yeah

2209.12 --> 2214.74
great

2211.28 --> 2217.86
because it's concealed that's why that's

2214.74 --> 2219.99
what happens when you look past a flat

2217.86 --> 2222.6
plane into the distance eventually

2219.99 --> 2230.18
things will start to conceal from bottom

2222.6 --> 2230.18
up happens demonstrably so

2235.76 --> 2238.889
[Music]

2248.51 --> 2259.59
well that's the thing it could but it's

2256.5 --> 2263.09
not really relevant because if you're

2259.59 --> 2267.6600000000003
going to use that as an argument as to

2263.09 --> 2270.119
that that is the curve well you can't

2267.66 --> 2271.92
really isolate that because it happens

2270.119 --> 2276.33
when you look over a flat surface

2271.92 --> 2285.26
confirmed flat as well so it's a nun

2276.33 --> 2285.2599999999998
argument all right

2294.53 --> 2298.7200000000003
what God

2306.74 --> 2311.7799999999997
how do you even know when my show is

2308.99 --> 2314.66
gonna end conspiracy cats look if you

2311.78 --> 2321.4100000000003
want to get in a conversation on my show

2314.66 --> 2325.2799999999997
that's fine that's okay but I'm not

2321.41 --> 2326.95
really gonna come on your channel thank

2325.28 --> 2330.1400000000003
you

2326.95 --> 2330.14
[Music]

2358.64 --> 2363.94
chocolate

2361.57 --> 2366.46
yeah you do that conspiracy cat's

2363.94 --> 2369.54
pasture offers on to somebody else and

2366.46 --> 2374.41
more people there's plenty of people

2369.54 --> 2376.18
love to take any offer it's always

2374.41 --> 2381.24
people out there ready to take your

2376.18 --> 2381.24
offer I don't give a [ __ ]

2392.02 --> 2395.559
I'm out of tea

2400.4 --> 2404.54
I'm gonna get some new teeth

2515.809 --> 2526.4700000000003
you sorry for the delay guys and girls

2522.71 --> 2529.0190000000002
yeah the tail the team wasn't or the

2526.47 --> 2532.2599999999998
water still had to boil so I have to get

2529.019 --> 2544.25
back in a few minutes yes this is

2532.26 --> 2546.5690000000004
recording Jose ah so disappointing I

2544.25 --> 2549.66
really had hoped that Brenda would have

2546.569 --> 2553.279
kind of come on today you know it takes

2549.66 --> 2556.049
a long time for me in order to make room

2553.279 --> 2557.97
to just be able to entertain her and I

2556.049 --> 2561.93
thought that I this was a good

2557.97 --> 2563.339
opportunity of course now then you

2561.93 --> 2567.6499999999996
actually want her on the show she

2563.339 --> 2567.65
doesn't actually show up very typical

2585.8 --> 2588.4300000000003
what

2591.14 --> 2594.7999999999997
that's ridiculous

2612.87 --> 2618.87
okay well it's time for you to go then I

2616.66 --> 2618.87
guess

2626.13 --> 2629.309
[Music]

2637.03 --> 2648.67
yeah Wow

2640.09 --> 2650.71
face that I don't think you know no

2648.67 --> 2657.67
there's definitely people out there that

2650.71 --> 2662.77
are more useless than Brenda but I guess

2657.67 --> 2668.28
that for the amount of presence that she

2662.77 --> 2673.69
has I guess how do you say the presence

2668.28 --> 2676.2400000000002
versus usefulness relation then yeah she

2673.69 --> 2679.39
scores pretty low for everything she

2676.24 --> 2685.6299999999997
knows she doesn't seem to understand a

2679.39 --> 2688.21
lot of it or at least barely but there's

2685.63 --> 2693.37
a lot dumber people out there a lot

2688.21 --> 2695.95
dumber you know I think that I'm talking

2693.37 --> 2702.81
to phase here by the way infamous troll

2695.95 --> 2705.9689999999996
but I think that David is probably worse

2702.81 --> 2705.969
[Music]

2708.48 --> 2713.44
originally the only redeeming factor

2711.31 --> 2716.17
about him in the beginning of the debate

2713.44 --> 2719.32
was that he was supposedly on the

2716.17 --> 2722.55
flatter side but that entire thing is

2719.32 --> 2725.55
now completely derailed by his

2722.55 --> 2725.55
ridiculous

2726.39 --> 2732.69
multi conflicting logical trains of

2730.03 --> 2734.8300000000004
thought it's getting so ridiculous so a

2732.69 --> 2738.46
hello thank you for the super chair

2734.83 --> 2742.29
donation or if the seriously flat $2 be

2738.46 --> 2750.1
careful trigging his manager God Globes

2742.29 --> 2755.91
zombies you know my God why do you even

2750.1 --> 2759.3399999999997
want to think about that for [ __ ] sake

2755.91 --> 2761.79
like seriously who is more perverted

2759.34 --> 2761.79
here

2769.42 --> 2775.96
all right yes I heard Jose I already

2773.41 --> 2783.22
treated it by the way thanks for the

2775.96 --> 2789.79
superjet donation anyway but yeah PJ I

2783.22 --> 2793.4399999999996
don't have to do anything then if a

2789.79 --> 2798.0099999999998
super Chad is really truly irredeemably

2793.44 --> 2801.42
unoffensive I will actually been super

2798.01 --> 2801.42
Chad and all so

2807.66 --> 2810.44
all right

2822.65 --> 2832.64
all right yeah Jose I saw the part and

2827.299 --> 2836.089
look I don't blame anyone okay if you

2832.64 --> 2838.49
write just write the hand that's enough

2836.089 --> 2841.22
information he was there oh that means

2838.49 --> 2846.5589999999997
that it's gonna explode in fights in

2841.22 --> 2849.23
Savannah ego dick swinging because that

2846.559 --> 2857.1800000000003
what's happened what always happens when

2849.23 --> 2862.039
he's there always so I'm just wondering

2857.18 --> 2864.2889999999998
why why Brenda eventually said about

2862.039 --> 2867.8900000000003
Randy like oh you planned this

2864.289 --> 2870.7400000000002
you planned this to happen because was

2867.89 --> 2874.609
it was it supposed to be a small room a

2870.74 --> 2878.359
private room did she explicitly asked

2874.609 --> 2882.0789999999997
rentee or whatever that they keep the

2878.359 --> 2888.049
room small and then he opened it up I

2882.079 --> 2890.1800000000003
don't know the those are among the

2888.049 --> 2893.359
questions that I have for Brenda just

2890.18 --> 2895.509
want to know like what is it about you

2893.359 --> 2895.509
know

2899.74 --> 2906.2599999999998
hey thanks again earth the seriously

2903.77 --> 2909.64
flat for $2 super chair donation globe

2906.26 --> 2917.92
zombies mentally mentality is

2909.64 --> 2917.92
pseudoscience devil had angry globe

2933.53 --> 2940.88
God all people free people seriously

2937.67 --> 2943.82
that like this morning I was watching

2940.88 --> 2946.2200000000003
Big Bang Theory and there was this

2943.82 --> 2949.28
episode where exactly that [ __ ] was

2946.22 --> 2953.7799999999997
running joke about digging through the

2949.28 --> 2958.6400000000003
globe here you end up in China and and

2953.78 --> 2961.88
some Chinese person died at the burial

2958.64 --> 2963.65
and any imagine would how deep would the

2961.88 --> 2966.86
hole have to be before he reached the

2963.65 --> 2969.07
heart I hate those kind of synchronous

2966.86 --> 2969.07
this

2979.2 --> 2985.0
yeah but when I was a kid I constantly

2982.45 --> 2989.0499999999997
drowned in that stupid saying digging

2985.0 --> 2991.15
the hole to China I was constantly

2989.05 --> 2994.44
screwing around with that and so

2991.15 --> 2994.44
annoying in retrospect

3002.93 --> 3010.6299999999997
right and there is no edge mark colored

3005.45 --> 3010.6299999999997
there is no edge no proof of an edge

3028.15 --> 3030.96
all right

3031.36 --> 3040.06
yeah but the point the point about a

3035.53 --> 3043.5400000000004
missing edge is that the idea that the

3040.06 --> 3046.06
earth must have a certain geometry

3043.54 --> 3049.93
within a literal Valley

3046.06 --> 3052.33
volumetric space and that if it has no

3049.93 --> 3058.02
edge that must mean that it can only be

3052.33 --> 3061.66
a globe that is faulty reasoning because

3058.02 --> 3064.5099999999998
you there is no full understanding of

3061.66 --> 3067.48
what the realm is in the first place to

3064.51 --> 3069.5800000000004
begin with to even assume that it must

3067.48 --> 3073.45
have some kind of geometry within a

3069.58 --> 3077.8199999999997
volumetric space like that there that's

3073.45 --> 3080.89
where the faulty assumptions come in no

3077.82 --> 3083.56
wow thanks again Earth is seriously flat

3080.89 --> 3094.33
ask globe zombies how to test distance

3083.56 --> 3097.87
of Polaris right so all this volumetric

3094.33 --> 3101.89
space is assumed and that the earth is

3097.87 --> 3104.88
sitting in it so when is it gonna be

3101.89 --> 3108.52
tested I want to test what the realms of

3104.88 --> 3111.9900000000002
volumetric space really is because I'm

3108.52 --> 3117.97
kind of assuming that the earth is not

3111.99 --> 3121.93
an object sitting within a nearly empty

3117.97 --> 3124.75
or gas or whatever supposed vacuum kind

3121.93 --> 3130.75
of space now I'm assuming that there is

3124.75 --> 3133.39
a some kind of spatial confine a limited

3130.75 --> 3136.21
you could say pocket dimension it's been

3133.39 --> 3139.15
conceptualized like that but that that

3136.21 --> 3141.52
is the very nature of the creation of

3139.15 --> 3145.1800000000003
our realm in the first place that it is

3141.52 --> 3147.34
like a pocket dimension that has just a

3145.18 --> 3153.64
certain amount of special room with it

3147.34 --> 3155.9100000000003
within it that loops in on itself and it

3153.64 --> 3158.77
is filled it is just feel that

3155.91 --> 3162.06
everything about this spacial confined

3158.77 --> 3162.06
is filled up with matter

3168.01 --> 3173.8590000000004
hey yeah mark color that's fine look you

3171.79 --> 3176.38
guys are constantly interacting with one

3173.859 --> 3179.49
another while I am trying to desperately

3176.38 --> 3183.28
get a conversation with you separately

3179.49 --> 3185.35
so I end up hooking into somebody else's

3183.28 --> 3187.0
conversation and then making a big point

3185.35 --> 3200.8199999999997
out of it so that happens constantly

3187.0 --> 3209.1
don't worry about it so why is it there

3200.82 --> 3212.5800000000004
why is existence existence yes

3209.1 --> 3212.58
that's my answer

3227.88 --> 3233.6600000000003
and if you want a more philosophical

3230.089 --> 3237.93
conscious based explanation or a reason

3233.66 --> 3240.1499999999996
then it is a much more elaborate and

3237.93 --> 3244.1699999999996
complicated story but it basically comes

3240.15 --> 3248.369
down to we this entire realm is like a

3244.17 --> 3251.099
holodeck for our spirits which

3248.369 --> 3254.069
originated from a non-material realm so

3251.099 --> 3256.4100000000003
this material realm was designated and

3254.069 --> 3262.23
created by the creator of which we are

3256.41 --> 3264.259
all fragments separated fragments so we

3262.23 --> 3268.67
can have a more limited conscious

3264.259 --> 3271.349
separated within the physical realm and

3268.67 --> 3274.44
the design of the physical realm and the

3271.349 --> 3276.9900000000002
nature of the spirit combined gives a

3274.44 --> 3281.73
deeper understanding and insight and

3276.99 --> 3285.41
meaning to it all to the Creator and to

3281.73 --> 3289.95
the the realm the artificial creation di

3285.41 --> 3295.529
artificial the physical creation the

3289.95 --> 3298.3489999999997
realm that was designed for our spirits

3295.529 --> 3308.069
to do this that's the reason the reason

3298.349 --> 3311.3590000000004
is spiritual entropy spiritual entropy

3308.069 --> 3311.359
and resolve

3314.64 --> 3320.73
so that is the much much more

3316.859 --> 3322.92
complicated answer as to why because

3320.73 --> 3329.339
that is what's happening that is what

3322.92 --> 3333.089
drives us so take away the personified

3329.339 --> 3337.47
approach just see what is honest what is

3333.089 --> 3339.359
without words and then you see it that

3337.47 --> 3344.45
is what we're doing that's where we're

3339.359 --> 3344.45
going that is why it's happening

3350.65 --> 3353.9700000000003
so I'm gonna get my tea

3398.48 --> 3405.599
man I should save up my early coffees

3402.27 --> 3407.609
more this double coffee dose is really

3405.599 --> 3424.44
doing me all kinds of good inspiration

3407.609 --> 3425.96
wise realm can i define realm sure I can

3424.44 --> 3428.81
look it up for you

3425.96 --> 3431.849
but I can also go by the very

3428.81 --> 3435.45
understanding as hi how I've assimilated

3431.849 --> 3439.44
through the confrontation of the word

3435.45 --> 3441.21
throughout my life nobody we thank you

3439.44 --> 3444.93
David Blackson for the super chat

3441.21 --> 3451.4
donation much much appreciated so realm

3444.93 --> 3451.3999999999996
a realm is a a place it is

3456.52 --> 3465.099
a space separate from whatever else is

3464.44 --> 3470.7400000000002
out there

3465.099 --> 3473.98
I realism how we're gonna play with

3470.74 --> 3476.3489999999997
words are we okay I'll just google it

3473.98 --> 3478.18
then oh by the way thanks again Earth is

3476.349 --> 3481.96
seriously flat for the super chat

3478.18 --> 3486.839
donation spray today and branded the

3481.96 --> 3486.839
perfect example of demonic globe zombiu

3494.43 --> 3502.99
yes but also big no cuz what Brenda the

3500.89 --> 3506.98
demonic side of it yeah the trickery

3502.99 --> 3509.41
that but the real demonic nature is to

3506.98 --> 3512.56
abuse it and resolve and power and

3509.41 --> 3514.99
Brenda's not really doing that Brenda is

3512.56 --> 3516.79
mostly just doing what she does because

3514.99 --> 3519.1299999999997
of the consequences of the choices that

3516.79 --> 3521.83
she made and she's not just ending up

3519.13 --> 3524.9100000000003
with what a lot of people that do that

3521.83 --> 3526.99
end up with and that is loneliness and a

3524.91 --> 3529.8999999999996
almost insatiable hunger for

3526.99 --> 3532.4199999999996
companionship that has become much

3529.9 --> 3539.4900000000002
harder to attain because of the choices

3532.42 --> 3541.9900000000002
that they made and I think that besides

3539.49 --> 3545.02
boring us all to death and giving us

3541.99 --> 3547.089
headaches he's really for some book

3545.02 --> 3550.359
demonic I don't think it's really that

3547.089 --> 3553.5299999999997
bad it's just more like a waste of time

3550.359 --> 3553.5299999999997
most of the time

3564.71 --> 3574.52
so well PJ I can only figure out what

3571.58 --> 3578.0299999999997
her motivations are based on everything

3574.52 --> 3583.46
that I've seen about her and my personal

3578.03 --> 3587.599
interactions with her so yeah I can I

3583.46 --> 3591.92
can actually derive motivations from

3587.599 --> 3595.19
interactions and motivations and can do

3591.92 --> 3598.359
the same with you and of course that can

3595.19 --> 3601.88
always be hidden elements if somebody is

3598.359 --> 3604.0989999999997
serious enough or dedicated enough or a

3601.88 --> 3607.2200000000003
good enough actor to completely hide

3604.099 --> 3610.46
those elements but it's not easy to hide

3607.22 --> 3614.6899999999996
that kind of [ __ ] for me because just I

3610.46 --> 3617.83
see very sharp so any kind of shining

3614.69 --> 3621.619
out something hidden will immediately

3617.83 --> 3623.72
like a guard dog trigger give a response

3621.619 --> 3626.7200000000003
seeing there is something hidden there I

3623.72 --> 3634.73
just got the trained instincts for this

3626.72 --> 3637.1899999999996
now so and I think that most people on

3634.73 --> 3640.339
the scene really don't have any secret

3637.19 --> 3647.9900000000002
agendas I think they're using the

3640.339 --> 3652.72
widespread the the mindset of the times

3647.99 --> 3655.97
to just drag more attention to them with

3652.72 --> 3658.5499999999997
conspiracy hidden agenda suggestions

3655.97 --> 3661.8489999999997
like it was a hidden flavor like an

3658.55 --> 3663.77
easter egg thing come on like mark

3661.849 --> 3669.05
Sargent pretty much openly does that

3663.77 --> 3672.589
continually it's like his gag but you

3669.05 --> 3675.619
can't seriously believe that there is

3672.589 --> 3679.97
some really really secret agenda behind

3675.619 --> 3683.589
any of these people and if there is then

3679.97 --> 3689.27
the agenda will be very blatant and will

3683.589 --> 3691.369
reveal because real agendas only exist

3689.27 --> 3693.83
real secret hidden agendas to build

3691.369 --> 3696.77
something that is very important so it

3693.83 --> 3698.45
results in a manifestation in an actual

3696.77 --> 3702.109
thing being built

3698.45 --> 3704.359
a guy talking endlessly about the same

3702.109 --> 3707.69
thing over and over again that's not an

3704.359 --> 3708.339
agenda that person does not have an

3707.69 --> 3710.809
agenda

3708.339 --> 3714.74
they're just literally wasting their own

3710.809 --> 3717.6400000000003
time obsessing over something no you'll

3714.74 --> 3721.3999999999996
find the real agenda when real things

3717.64 --> 3725.99
start to build up when real money is

3721.4 --> 3729.049
being grown companies a media empire

3725.99 --> 3730.819
that that is where you see it that is

3729.049 --> 3734.9
where the hidden agendas reveal

3730.819 --> 3737.7799999999997
themselves because hidden agendas really

3734.9 --> 3741.65
only come into being if there is

3737.78 --> 3743.48
something to be gained you don't just

3741.65 --> 3746.839
have take the effort of a secret agenda

3743.48 --> 3749.93
just to be interesting of blah no it's

3746.839 --> 3754.96
always to get something you want and

3749.93 --> 3764.45
that usually is power or money or

3754.96 --> 3767.049
control so agenda revealed themselves by

3764.45 --> 3767.049
actions

3768.43 --> 3775.0589999999997
[Music]

3780.02 --> 3783.969
[Music]

3784.74 --> 3795.0989999999997
what Ghaith iose gets triggered by

3792.31 --> 3796.2599999999998
flat-earthers testing what were you

3795.099 --> 3804.94
talking about

3796.26 --> 3808.2000000000003
thanks for the super chat donation what

3804.94 --> 3808.2000000000003
are you talking about

3815.24 --> 3824.27
oh yeah I did know this Amanda young

3818.54 --> 3827.24
thanks thanks again always appreciate

3824.27 --> 3830.93
your support I really do I'm it's nice

3827.24 --> 3833.9199999999996
having you in chat and I'm very lucky to

3830.93 --> 3833.9199999999996
have you

3848.48 --> 3854.48
right well CGI ranty yeah that's correct

3851.51 --> 3857.4500000000003
but you do recognize how that works

3854.48 --> 3861.44
right it is always when people just try

3857.45 --> 3865.25
to squeeze money out of groups then they

3861.44 --> 3867.29
hype it up then it becomes a stunt an

3865.25 --> 3870.44
advertisement stunt because the

3867.29 --> 3872.39
excitement will make people just more

3870.44 --> 3875.54
willing to throw out money so it's a

3872.39 --> 3879.71
it's a trick you know who invented that

3875.54 --> 3886.67
trick of course don't even need a pseudo

3879.71 --> 3891.079
name it but yeah that's the trick and if

3886.67 --> 3893.4500000000003
they afterwards get their money and they

3891.079 --> 3896.4500000000003
just don't do what they say or step away

3893.45 --> 3900.79
or close down and just run away with the

3896.45 --> 3900.79
money well that's revelation right there

3901.39 --> 3909.8289999999997
so I am I'm never really overly

3906.14 --> 3913.48
enthusiastic to really do something like

3909.829 --> 3917.7200000000003
that unless it was absolutely necessary

3913.48 --> 3920.93
and that it wouldn't leave some kind of

3917.72 --> 3923.24
bad taste except with the clovers of

3920.93 --> 3924.74
course because yeah any kind of progress

3923.24 --> 3926.5299999999997
for me will always leave a bad taste

3924.74 --> 3931.97
with certain type of Global's

3926.53 --> 3935.9900000000002
but I don't like it's rather much rather

3931.97 --> 3941.3289999999997
just smooth smooth stable growth and

3935.99 --> 3949.0989999999997
just let let the people help when they

3941.329 --> 3953.0
can and yeah but again yeah I really

3949.099 --> 3956.54
don't need a to do a special session to

3953.0 --> 3958.43
get my GoFundMe going for my camera

3956.54 --> 3962.329
because I've been sitting so long and

3958.43 --> 3968.2999999999997
wanting that camera it's should really

3962.329 --> 3971.1800000000003
get there at some point but I don't have

3968.3 --> 3973.79
any direct plans for it yet first I want

3971.18 --> 3976.6699999999996
to figure out if I can overhaul my show

3973.79 --> 3978.44
in a in a in a good consistent way with

3976.67 --> 3984.619
how it's been

3978.44 --> 3989.539
so I'm open for suggestions from people

3984.619 --> 3991.839
that I respect you know if you're one of

3989.539 --> 3991.8390000000004
those people

3996.67 --> 3999.2400000000002
Wow

4033.22 --> 4041.3489999999997
no no no no no that's a that's ellipses

4038.47 --> 4043.859
imperious that's literally solid solid

4041.349 --> 4047.6090000000004
season where you're going right there oh

4043.859 --> 4050.5589999999997
if you're not sure of this and that then

4047.609 --> 4053.89
there's nothing right nothing nothing

4050.559 --> 4060.4
can be proven now no now the thing is is

4053.89 --> 4064.5389999999998
that what the earth realm is is still to

4060.4 --> 4068.579
be discovered for a bigger part the work

4064.539 --> 4071.9100000000003
be worked out but the evidence against

4068.579 --> 4077.049
that the earth is the globe in the way

4071.91 --> 4078.8799999999997
that is being said you don't need to

4077.049 --> 4082.75
know what the earth really is in order

4078.88 --> 4087.13
to disprove that it is what they say it

4082.75 --> 4092.099
is in other words the earth is not a

4087.13 --> 4092.099
spinning ball in outer space

4099.07 --> 4108.23
now yeah sure but solipsism is also the

4103.76 --> 4110.93
belief that you can't really be certain

4108.23 --> 4114.129999999999
of anything anymore it is basically

4110.93 --> 4117.650000000001
rejecting a lot of people do it

4114.13 --> 4120.92
religiously when the thing they believe

4117.65 --> 4123.379999999999
in when they lose grip on it and they

4120.92 --> 4125.72
just don't want to accept any

4123.38 --> 4128.27
alternative so they just resort to

4125.72 --> 4130.93
believing nothing to kneel ISM to

4128.27 --> 4130.93
solipsism

4140.96 --> 4147.47
all right I could probably in future

4143.99 --> 4151.46
just call it nihilism because that's

4147.47 --> 4154.22
more direct to what is going on but

4151.46 --> 4159.02
solipsism does give a more technical

4154.22 --> 4161.33
insight in how it comes into being how

4159.02 --> 4165.2300000000005
people respond the way they do and I

4161.33 --> 4169.07
think that's noteworthy because people

4165.23 --> 4171.349999999999
do respond like that a lot it is a very

4169.07 --> 4175.13
irrational response but it happens and

4171.35 --> 4178.52
it's kind of good to know why again

4175.13 --> 4182.05
thank you sseriously flat it's a rescue

4178.52 --> 4182.05
mission enough spinning balls

4182.56 --> 4185.56
Fe

4191.819 --> 4194.27
now

4194.98 --> 4205.79
that is interesting Judas I'll bet she's

4203.75 --> 4207.82
not very happy with you writing that

4205.79 --> 4207.82
book

4226.61 --> 4231.25
a good point of people free people

4252.349 --> 4271.6990000000005
Wow Wow matrix neo that is special I so

4269.54 --> 4274.73
Antonio is now attacking Owen Benjamin

4271.699 --> 4278.589999999999
easy that is

4274.73 --> 4278.589999999999
that's was a matter of time

4290.71 --> 4297.52
right PJ look not everybody has a

4294.69 --> 4301.929999999999
exploration hunger need to fill that

4297.52 --> 4307.05
void with it it seems like Nathan is

4301.93 --> 4310.240000000001
just more prioritized in what he wants

4307.05 --> 4314.02
that he can just have the the proper

4310.24 --> 4317.71
argument to deflect delusional people

4314.02 --> 4320.17
that's how he approaches it I'm much

4317.71 --> 4322.4800000000005
more interested in actually finding out

4320.17 --> 4324.9400000000005
what it is how it could be working

4322.48 --> 4326.83
that's why I'm typically a Cosmo genus

4324.94 --> 4329.5599999999995
then that's why I can presuppose all

4326.83 --> 4336.85
kinds of things in order to figure out

4329.56 --> 4341.110000000001
what it would be like so everybody has

4336.85 --> 4346.71
their own priorities as to why they do

4341.11 --> 4350.41
what they do yeah Antonio has been on my

4346.71 --> 4352.72
on my creepy list for a long time and

4350.41 --> 4356.62
literally just tried never to talk about

4352.72 --> 4359.71
him and it's not like oh well Patricia

4356.62 --> 4362.5
is gone now now it's okay now I can just

4359.71 --> 4370.87
go back to him you know now he's been

4362.5 --> 4374.29
very very creepy and he is a a real

4370.87 --> 4377.32
hater and bully like a real nasty one

4374.29 --> 4379.3
when he feels like it but the thing is

4377.32 --> 4382.57
he's so controlled about it sometimes

4379.3 --> 4385.27
and at occasion and then talking about

4382.57 --> 4387.73
just randomly bumping into it I would go

4385.27 --> 4391.72
to his chat or something just say hello

4387.73 --> 4394.36
and it was completely neutral but say

4391.72 --> 4397.240000000001
two years ago if I do that he would

4394.36 --> 4401.4
literally just isolate me timeout or ban

4397.24 --> 4405.04
me and then start shaming me in in

4401.4 --> 4409.87
recognizable ways you know what I mean

4405.04 --> 4411.88
it's very much like what Spurs chemo for

4409.87 --> 4415.66
example tries to do it's very similar

4411.88 --> 4419.35
just gradual character assassination

4415.66 --> 4422.88
based on circumstantial on my

4419.35 --> 4422.88
circumstance is that kind of [ __ ]

4423.429 --> 4431.4400000000005
when people do that it crosses a line

4427.85 --> 4431.4400000000005
that cannot be uncrossed

4438.959 --> 4441.959
okay

4456.59 --> 4464.27
then again I yeah I've called Antonio

4460.28 --> 4469.15
super hats all kinds of things but it

4464.27 --> 4473.06
did kind of deserve that still I think

4469.15 --> 4476.23
are just the difference the main

4473.06 --> 4480.110000000001
difference is that don'ts panel they

4476.23 --> 4483.049999999999
attacking people that I know are nasty

4480.11 --> 4485.12
or evil or dangerous just don't do it

4483.05 --> 4486.92
it'll fill me up on my whole day and

4485.12 --> 4487.78
again I explained yesterday it's not my

4486.92 --> 4495.26
thing

4487.78 --> 4499.13
it'll just drag them to me I'd rather

4495.26 --> 4502.79
have just good conversations with people

4499.13 --> 4505.76
that want similar things some progress

4502.79 --> 4513.83
some insight some grasp on the situation

4505.76 --> 4517.72
and protection against the darkness that

4513.83 --> 4520.55
and learning how to do that yourself and

4517.72 --> 4523.150000000001
then we can all do it ourselves

4520.55 --> 4523.150000000001
together

4535.76 --> 4546.59
yeah thank you guys okay Brenda's not

4541.469 --> 4551.07
coming on oh well she still isn't back

4546.59 --> 4552.51
I've been going for our 15 minutes or so

4551.07 --> 4558.32
I think I'm gonna round out to show it's

4552.51 --> 4558.320000000001
been good though I've been a good show I

4561.77 --> 4574.580000000001
think I need to get myself some lunch no

4569.91 --> 4574.58
wait maybe maybe not yet let's see

4580.819 --> 4586.459000000001
all right yeah matrix media but that

4583.969 --> 4587.299
that is kind of a thing though is it is

4586.459 --> 4589.999
isn't it

4587.299 --> 4593.629
I've been watching Owen Benjamin very

4589.999 --> 4600.459
closely and he's literally sarvagna

4593.629 --> 4606.469
baiting it's amazing it is an art and I

4600.459 --> 4609.709
it's just it's hidden in plain sight and

4606.469 --> 4612.079
it's an open trap it's an open trap it

4609.709 --> 4616.8189999999995
is amazing how he does it but what he

4612.079 --> 4620.3589999999995
does is he chooses things to say that

4616.819 --> 4622.939
are kind of risky but controlled and

4620.359 --> 4625.849
he's literally just hanging out little

4622.939 --> 4628.51
little hooks with piece of stuff on eBay

4625.849 --> 4631.399
and then the savonius they have to bite

4628.51 --> 4633.769
and then that bite that trigger that

4631.399 --> 4636.829000000001
hook through their little sylvania mouth

4633.769 --> 4638.749
just hurts so bad that it just have to

4636.829 --> 4643.5689999999995
then suddenly start attacking Owen

4638.749 --> 4648.129
Benjamin and the Savannah Bates

4643.569 --> 4651.859
distracts them from actually addressing

4648.129 --> 4654.949
anything real and they will just take

4651.859 --> 4658.189
the easy all all that easy bait oh look

4654.949 --> 4663.919
oh it's racist oh he's this oh is that

4658.189 --> 4666.619000000001
so easy so easy and it was there on

4663.919 --> 4668.449
purpose it was Savannah bait and all the

4666.619 --> 4672.829
Savannah's will take all the bait and

4668.449 --> 4676.478999999999
say oh my god we won look at this and it

4672.829 --> 4676.478999999999
was always meant to do that

4676.929 --> 4685.51
so yeah it's awesome it's fascinating

4682.879 --> 4685.51
how it works

4697.13 --> 4705.39
thanks to me skiing I do my best I tried

4701.88 --> 4709.08
to stay interesting and I even tried to

4705.39 --> 4711.660000000001
watch my own shows every day sometimes

4709.08 --> 4716.64
it's great sometimes the halfway I just

4711.66 --> 4719.61
turn it off because it just gets IE you

4716.64 --> 4721.26
guys probably don't have that but I when

4719.61 --> 4723.78
I for example have certain silent

4721.26 --> 4726.84
moments I may be concealing something

4723.78 --> 4729.57
inside myself like feelings that have no

4726.84 --> 4731.88
place to be put out there and then when

4729.57 --> 4734.28
I see myself back you guys don't see

4731.88 --> 4736.29
that but I get remind like oh wait I

4734.28 --> 4739.23
didn't feel good then and I feel it back

4736.29 --> 4742.74
so I just sometimes I can't really watch

4739.23 --> 4744.9
myself what other times I'm really

4742.74 --> 4747.03
surprised by how good it is what comes

4744.9 --> 4751.349999999999
out of my mouth really surprised like

4747.03 --> 4753.96
wow that me that is cool

4751.35 --> 4761.58
never expected to be able to talk like

4753.96 --> 4764.1
that say 20 years ago anyway I am gonna

4761.58 --> 4766.29
round out the show so thanks everyone

4764.1 --> 4768.96
for coming including a lot of new people

4766.29 --> 4773.24
active in chat some of which seem to be

4768.96 --> 4776.49
kind of glow bursts but that's fine just

4773.24 --> 4779.13
you can be a little cheeky

4776.49 --> 4783.54
just don't get too filthy and things

4779.13 --> 4786.08
will be alright and yet don't start so

4783.54 --> 4789.0
funny poking people that's just annoying

4786.08 --> 4792.93
but yeah glow bursts flat earthers are

4789.0 --> 4795.48
welcome here both of them just if you

4792.93 --> 4799.02
bathe and try to respect one another

4795.48 --> 4800.82
that must be the objective you you must

4799.02 --> 4802.92
wield that objective in order to be in

4800.82 --> 4804.36
my chat and if you're don't have that

4802.92 --> 4809.93
objective and you're just there to
