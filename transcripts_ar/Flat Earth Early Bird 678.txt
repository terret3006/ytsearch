the fuzzler hello

146.56 --> 159.84
yeah anyway good to see you guys

156.0 --> 162.879
i had a very late night again yesterday

159.84 --> 162.879
surprise surprise

165.36 --> 168.959
there was a lot going on and i stuck got

168.56 --> 171.76
stuck

168.959 --> 172.64000000000001
watching movies again at night it's like

171.76 --> 175.84
i don't know i'm

172.64 --> 179.44
a bit restless in the night last week

175.84 --> 182.31900000000002
and then i just keep on clicking on the

179.44 --> 182.319
next movie

182.64 --> 186.95899999999997
even though i told myself yesterday that

185.04 --> 189.599
i shouldn't do that

186.959 --> 191.12
but yeah sometimes just interesting what

189.599 --> 193.76
comes by

191.12 --> 194.8
uh like for example i watch mortal

193.76 --> 199.599
kombat

194.8 --> 203.28
the old movie

199.599 --> 206.48
and yeah with some really shitty cgi

203.28 --> 208.72
but also some amazing animatronics

206.48 --> 209.84
and like the atmosphere of that movie is

208.72 --> 212.319
pretty unique

209.84 --> 213.599
because it's kind of grim but it's also

212.319 --> 218.0
funny

213.599 --> 222.159
and it's weird i've never seen anything

218.0 --> 224.48
like that since that movie

222.159 --> 227.84
and it's it's been a long time since i

224.48 --> 227.84
watched that

229.04 --> 235.2
vendisolf and then what now you're

231.84 --> 235.20000000000002
talking about street fighter

235.519 --> 239.59900000000002
that's not the movie i watched that

237.12 --> 243.68
movie is really freaking stupid

239.599 --> 248.72
like it's dumb this movie

243.68 --> 248.72
is weird it's just weird

250.799 --> 255.519
but it's very interesting for me also

253.519 --> 256.799
because yeah because of this setup of

255.519 --> 260.479
the whole thing

256.799 --> 263.59999999999997
out world and

260.479 --> 266.08
you might take notice during this movie

263.6 --> 267.12
there's not a lot of planet watching

266.08 --> 269.84
going on

267.12 --> 270.32
so it's much more about dimensions and

269.84 --> 273.67999999999995
like

270.32 --> 276.8
you go well

273.68 --> 276.8
to another place

277.28 --> 280.4
and there's like portals also magical

279.52 --> 283.52
portals going

280.4 --> 283.84
lots of magic going on in there and lots

283.52 --> 287.75899999999996
of

283.84 --> 287.75899999999996
evil but yes

288.88 --> 294.15999999999997
it's good to just watch it again and

290.639 --> 294.16
just realize that like oh wait

294.84 --> 297.84
huh

299.44 --> 302.639
like the funny thing is is that the way

301.44 --> 306.16
i've been talking about

302.639 --> 309.919
cosmogeny and like potential realm

306.16 --> 310.639
beyond the loop with an opening and all

309.919 --> 313.039
that

310.639 --> 314.32
and even talking about like what if the

313.039 --> 316.639
yeah if the gates were

314.32 --> 319.039
mechanically opened for example if there

316.639 --> 322.0
was a giants fire tapping out the energy

319.039 --> 323.039
well the funny thing about this movie is

322.0 --> 325.199
when you look at it

323.039 --> 327.12
from with that cosmody in the back of

325.199 --> 330.479
your mind

327.12 --> 331.44
it's like whoa this could potentially

330.479 --> 334.4
like you could

331.44 --> 335.6
latch that mechanic of cosmogeny onto

334.4 --> 338.63899999999995
this movie

335.6 --> 341.6
if you'd like it's very interesting

338.639 --> 342.8
but yeah mind experimentation basically

341.6 --> 346.96000000000004
fantasizing

342.8 --> 352.40000000000003
for most but yeah that that gave it a

346.96 --> 355.12
very interesting look

352.4 --> 357.039
and hey it's it's it's pretty decent

355.12 --> 359.28000000000003
movie like the fight scenes aren't

357.039 --> 360.88
really awesome

359.28 --> 363.28
not compared to like fighting

360.88 --> 365.039
choreography that that's going on

363.28 --> 366.71999999999997
in these days it's much more

365.039 --> 371.039
professional like that

366.72 --> 373.199
but uh yeah the some of the effects were

371.039 --> 374.479
decent enough for the time and it's

373.199 --> 376.8
convincing

374.479 --> 378.84
but on the other hand they also like did

376.8 --> 382.40000000000003
a lot of goofy

378.84 --> 384.88
gamifying like

382.4 --> 385.919
yeah situation twist that made no

384.88 --> 388.479
freaking sense

385.919 --> 389.919
whatsoever and hey some of the cgi was

388.479 --> 394.08
really freaking ugly and

389.919 --> 396.0
in infamously ugly like the reptile cgi

394.08 --> 397.28
figure which made no freaking sense

396.0 --> 399.6
whatsoever with the games

397.28 --> 400.479
so it's not a like when you look at the

399.6 --> 403.28000000000003
cosmo or

400.479 --> 403.28
like how the

403.52 --> 406.4
mortal kombat

406.88 --> 412.08
world works how that universe works

410.24 --> 413.68
in the game because there is like little

412.08 --> 416.15999999999997
stories in between the

413.68 --> 417.28000000000003
the fighting game that's pretty

416.16 --> 420.56
elaborate and they

417.28 --> 422.08
they try to base it off that as much as

420.56 --> 424.319
possible and by the way

422.08 --> 425.599
i forgot to mention some of the

424.319 --> 428.8
backgrounds

425.599 --> 431.599
are so mind-blowingly awesome

428.8 --> 432.639
like they really put so much attention

431.599 --> 436.0
and atmosphere

432.639 --> 440.0
in the backgrounds in the in the props

436.0 --> 442.8
and what's around yeah the the buildings

440.0 --> 443.68
it's pretty incredible also realizing

442.8 --> 450.40000000000003
that it's all

443.68 --> 453.199
practical work they did that so yeah

450.4 --> 455.52
it was interesting but there's a lot

453.199 --> 457.12
wrong with the movie anyways yeah

455.52 --> 458.79999999999995
a lot of people might not care about

457.12 --> 461.039
that for me

458.8 --> 462.88
it's kind of a little bit of a cult

461.039 --> 464.87899999999996
movie

462.88 --> 466.879
because i liked the mortal kombat game i

464.879 --> 469.759
liked like the

466.879 --> 471.68
the yeah the exciting extra dimensional

469.759 --> 475.36
cosmology of it

471.68 --> 479.36
and yeah it's also with with basically

475.36 --> 481.199
sort of like demonic people

479.36 --> 482.72
and there's like this whole deity

481.199 --> 486.16
situation going on

482.72 --> 486.879
it's very pantheonic anyway but it yeah

486.16 --> 490.56
it's

486.879 --> 493.44
it's fascinating and yeah the way the

490.56 --> 493.919
what the movie did with it was weird at

493.44 --> 496.0
it

493.919 --> 497.75899999999996
because i guess everybody would expect

496.0 --> 500.24
that it would be a lot more serious but

497.759 --> 501.039
they have this weird goofiness in it as

500.24 --> 505.039
well

501.039 --> 508.15999999999997
a little bit like johnny cage is like a

505.039 --> 511.28
separate comic relief even though

508.16 --> 512.399
he's a pretty cool character and that is

511.28 --> 515.12
like

512.399 --> 516.959
yeah so there's these unique traits

515.12 --> 517.519
about what's going on in this movie that

516.959 --> 521.279
i've just

517.519 --> 523.599
never seen anything like that after

521.279 --> 527.04
that is kind of unique so anyway i'll

523.599 --> 527.0400000000001
stop squirting about it now

527.06 --> 530.14
[Music]

532.8 --> 537.12
kill command to

537.36 --> 540.8000000000001
i don't remember that i might have seen

539.36 --> 543.6
that also

540.8 --> 543.5999999999999
but yeah

546.8 --> 550.7199999999999
because they used actual photos of the

548.72 --> 552.8000000000001
characters not animated yeah yeah

550.72 --> 554.6800000000001
they were one of the first to do that

552.8 --> 559.92
although not the first

554.68 --> 562.399
[Music]

559.92 --> 564.8
i think or were they the first maybe

562.399 --> 567.04
they were the first to do that

564.8 --> 568.959
but i do know that before that time they

567.04 --> 572.959
already had like

568.959 --> 575.68
3d uh like slowly

572.959 --> 577.1199999999999
rendered 3d so this is in the time where

575.68 --> 581.1999999999999
yeah you can just

577.12 --> 583.6
in yeah not interactively create 3d

581.2 --> 585.12
animation like so super easy right now

583.6 --> 587.0400000000001
right no no

585.12 --> 589.2
like making a frame of something that

587.04 --> 592.3199999999999
was actually 3d and not some

589.2 --> 594.0
polygon or wireframe took a long time

592.32 --> 595.6800000000001
but they did a very smart trick with

594.0 --> 596.8
this and i think i don't know who

595.68 --> 599.92
started this

596.8 --> 602.24
but i noticed that this already existed

599.92 --> 602.56
like on the amiga 1200 which was pretty

602.24 --> 606.0
much

602.56 --> 608.8
like a 90s and early 90s computer

606.0 --> 609.6
that i loved it's very sad to see that

608.8 --> 611.519
franchise

609.6 --> 613.519
plummet in on itself because of the

611.519 --> 615.44
corporate stupidity

613.519 --> 616.64
it could have been pretty damn good

615.44 --> 618.48
although they would still have to

616.64 --> 620.16
compete with bill gates so

618.48 --> 622.8000000000001
it was doomed to go down probably

620.16 --> 622.8
because of that

622.88 --> 627.68
but what they did was basically slowly

626.56 --> 632.2399999999999
render

627.68 --> 635.76
like pretty good looking 3d objects

632.24 --> 638.88
screen capture that and then use that

635.76 --> 640.959
in sprite so it would seem so 3d

638.88 --> 643.04
because it had to look a 3d but it was

640.959 --> 645.5999999999999
still frame by frame

643.04 --> 646.64
animation but they just pre instead of

645.6 --> 648.5600000000001
drawing it

646.64 --> 649.8389999999999
like a cartoon like they did in like the

648.56 --> 653.04
70s most of the time

649.839 --> 656.32
or all of the time just pixel drawings

653.04 --> 659.519
they 3d animated

656.32 --> 661.6
a thing and then screen captured

659.519 --> 662.8
that pretty much translated that

661.6 --> 665.12
directly into

662.8 --> 666.56
sprites you know this is pretty

665.12 --> 669.36
astounding

666.56 --> 670.959
the creativity that earlier programs had

669.36 --> 674.0
programmers had

670.959 --> 678.64
how they figured out how to basically

674.0 --> 681.92
create interesting appealing graphics

678.64 --> 683.4399999999999
so yeah and mortal kombat was one of the

681.92 --> 685.92
first that just did that

683.44 --> 685.9200000000001
full out

686.64 --> 689.8389999999999
and yeah

690.0 --> 694.48
made it a very popular game and others

692.079 --> 696.88
tried this as well but

694.48 --> 697.76
yeah more more the combat was always the

696.88 --> 699.279
first

697.76 --> 701.519
that doesn't necessarily make it the

699.279 --> 704.32
best fighting game

701.519 --> 706.88
because that seems to be more in the

704.32 --> 710.0790000000001
direction of street fighter like the

706.88 --> 711.12
street fighters yeah it's a different

710.079 --> 714.079
game but it yeah it's

711.12 --> 715.92
it's animated it's just hand drawn as a

714.079 --> 717.76
cartoonish but it's like as a fighting

715.92 --> 720.56
game

717.76 --> 723.12
it was very focused just on the on the

720.56 --> 724.0
technicals of the game and the fluidity

723.12 --> 726.399
and

724.0 --> 728.16
just getting into the fighting and yeah

726.399 --> 730.32
that probably made it better

728.16 --> 731.279
anyway this is all just 90s gaming

730.32 --> 734.8000000000001
squirting

731.279 --> 736.8
nevermind uh i watched that movie made

734.8 --> 737.8389999999999
me think back a lot and made me compare

736.8 --> 741.04
to cosmogeny

737.839 --> 744.24
but yeah big bear yesterday oh

741.04 --> 745.92
big bear killer instinct did it too

744.24 --> 749.2
yeah yeah shane hayden but killer

745.92 --> 749.1999999999999
instinct came much later

750.72 --> 754.399
they did like the overkill version of

753.68 --> 756.0
that

754.399 --> 758.959
and then instead of taking screen

756.0 --> 762.48
captures of real actors in clothes

758.959 --> 766.2399999999999
they did like advanced 3d

762.48 --> 767.839
modeling for the character really weird

766.24 --> 770.48
characters in there

767.839 --> 773.519
demonic as [ __ ] sometimes and then they

770.48 --> 777.2
just use that as screen capture

773.519 --> 779.839
but it wasn't as good i think i played

777.2 --> 782.639
that game too

779.839 --> 784.0
i didn't like the atmosphere of it more

782.639 --> 787.6
to combat was much

784.0 --> 789.92
it much more pulled you into the story

787.6 --> 791.0400000000001
into what it is like to have a mortal

789.92 --> 794.3199999999999
combat in that

791.04 --> 796.56
other dimension type place killer

794.32 --> 798.88
instinct

796.56 --> 800.399
it just seemed like a bunch of demons

798.88 --> 802.88
going at it

800.399 --> 802.88
that's it

810.24 --> 815.839
anyway yeah big bear yesterday was

812.839 --> 815.839
awesome

818.8 --> 822.24
i made a couple of notes

823.12 --> 827.04
he was talking yeah about a lot of

825.279 --> 829.279
things but

827.04 --> 831.199
like he brought up jesus walking over

829.279 --> 833.76
water what that meant and all that

831.199 --> 834.639
and i just like in my mind i quickly

833.76 --> 837.68
fabricated

834.639 --> 840.16
a concept like to make it technological

837.68 --> 841.92
like what if jesus just had the spirit

840.16 --> 843.279
power to basically change his own

841.92 --> 846.639
polarity

843.279 --> 849.519
using spirit power and

846.639 --> 850.48
or yeah chase change his electrostatic

849.519 --> 853.36
polarity

850.48 --> 853.9200000000001
i don't know this i'm i'm grabbing into

853.36 --> 855.36
technical

853.92 --> 857.4399999999999
regions where i don't technically

855.36 --> 858.16
exactly know what the terminology is

857.44 --> 861.839
anymore is

858.16 --> 863.8389999999999
i'm not an electric expert but

861.839 --> 866.48
that he would change his polarity it's

863.839 --> 869.7600000000001
just what i'm gonna call it so that

866.48 --> 871.9200000000001
his density would simply not

869.76 --> 873.68
be high enough to penetrate water

871.92 --> 875.04
anymore to kind of make himself lighter

873.68 --> 877.8389999999999
and that he used that to

875.04 --> 879.4399999999999
walk over water and that he even that he

877.839 --> 883.2790000000001
even like

879.44 --> 886.5600000000001
if if you believe in

883.279 --> 887.36
or if you attune yourself like another

886.56 --> 890.88
person

887.36 --> 893.519
with jesus if they attune themselves on

890.88 --> 894.32
onto jesus's frequency what he was doing

893.519 --> 898.0
right then

894.32 --> 900.399
then you could have that rub off like

898.0 --> 901.44
attuned to that frequency and cause the

900.399 --> 903.36
same effect to

901.44 --> 905.12
also be able to stand on water like that

903.36 --> 908.0
yeah it's just

905.12 --> 909.279
i'm i'm mechanizing it i'm making it

908.0 --> 912.24
into a mechanical

909.279 --> 913.76
thing instead of a miracle sorry about

912.24 --> 917.279
that

913.76 --> 919.519
but that made sense to me so

917.279 --> 921.6
yeah thought i'd make a note of it and

919.519 --> 924.8
then mention it here

921.6 --> 926.16
right so that the walking on water might

924.8 --> 929.4399999999999
be achieved if you

926.16 --> 931.16
are able to yeah cause a sort of

929.44 --> 934.1600000000001
levitation effect on yourself

931.16 --> 934.16
electrostatically

936.48 --> 942.9590000000001
all right anyway uh

939.6 --> 944.399
oh yeah he also did this amazing redneck

942.959 --> 948.079
rant

944.399 --> 950.0
and he did a twist a twist that like

948.079 --> 951.92
almost literally made me fall off my

950.0 --> 954.399
chair laughing

951.92 --> 955.12
didn't see coming he did it like a

954.399 --> 958.24
redneck

955.12 --> 961.44
2.0 as i call it

958.24 --> 965.12
like a like the old cartoonish redneck

961.44 --> 968.0
stereotype acting but then updated to

965.12 --> 970.16
to this age and it was like

968.0 --> 973.519
mind-blowingly funny

970.16 --> 975.519
and then after like a while he suddenly

973.519 --> 976.72
switched to like okay this is what

975.519 --> 979.839
happens when they ran

976.72 --> 982.0
out of out of bravada then they turned

979.839 --> 983.44
into ira so he then switched into ira

982.0 --> 985.279
and basically

983.44 --> 987.2790000000001
said like oh [ __ ] yeah but we did this

985.279 --> 991.92
and we did it oh jesus

987.279 --> 993.759
this is oh such gravy

991.92 --> 996.3199999999999
yesterday owen benjamin was just

993.759 --> 999.519
freaking amazing

996.32 --> 1002.5600000000001
and happy also to report

999.519 --> 1005.68
that d life barely cut out so i was able

1002.56 --> 1008.8389999999999
to just follow the whole thing

1005.68 --> 1010.76
and not just refresh my page every two

1008.839 --> 1013.9090000000001
minutes

1010.76 --> 1013.909
[Music]

1014.16 --> 1020.24
jesus controlled gravity no no no no no

1017.92 --> 1022.16
he would change hit he would effectively

1020.24 --> 1027.28
use electrostatics

1022.16 --> 1027.28
to change his body's density

1028.24 --> 1034.48
so that yeah it

1031.52 --> 1035.439
it would be you know that the technicals

1034.48 --> 1039.039
about it

1035.439 --> 1041.76
if he was able to sustain it

1039.039 --> 1043.679
even with extreme physical actions then

1041.76 --> 1048.079
who knows he might have been able to

1043.679 --> 1051.2800000000002
jump in that state like 10 meters high

1048.079 --> 1052.08
because of the density differential that

1051.28 --> 1055.44
he effectively

1052.08 --> 1057.6
would be causing if he could walk on

1055.44 --> 1059.6000000000001
water

1057.6 --> 1066.6399999999999
i don't know think about it i think

1059.6 --> 1069.84
about it

1066.64 --> 1069.8400000000001
yes not gravity

1072.16 --> 1077.3600000000001
right so that's it for the notes

1075.679 --> 1080.5590000000002
this morning i've been watching mark

1077.36 --> 1082.3999999999999
sergeant from yesterday are basically

1080.559 --> 1086.0
continuing it

1082.4 --> 1086.0
really interesting interview

1088.64 --> 1093.3600000000001
like this big part where it talks

1091.039 --> 1095.84
elaborately about conspiracies and what

1093.36 --> 1099.36
does it mean

1095.84 --> 1102.72
and how does he see it like when

1099.36 --> 1104.559
when something becomes plausible

1102.72 --> 1106.32
pointing out the technicals about what

1104.559 --> 1108.24
it officially is

1106.32 --> 1110.08
conspiracy and how it works in the

1108.24 --> 1113.1200000000001
justice is very elaborate

1110.08 --> 1114.1599999999999
i thought i very much appreciate it uh

1113.12 --> 1116.32
what's the issue

1114.16 --> 1118.559
mark sergeant what what's the problem

1116.32 --> 1118.559
here

1121.039 --> 1124.72
is he not good enough for you

1125.55 --> 1130.1599999999999
[Music]

1127.28 --> 1130.16
marky mark

1131.28 --> 1138.8799999999999
he's a funny guy yeah he also helped

1134.64 --> 1138.88
to awake a lot of people to flat earth

1141.52 --> 1145.12
he's like the level one drill sergeant

1144.0 --> 1147.36
to wreak in

1145.12 --> 1148.32
the new recruits and he has been for a

1147.36 --> 1151.28
long time

1148.32 --> 1152.32
yeah and he's funny that's right that's

1151.28 --> 1155.2
good

1152.32 --> 1156.559
because funny appeals to people it makes

1155.2 --> 1159.1200000000001
the whole thing a little less

1156.559 --> 1159.12
threatening

1160.9 --> 1165.679
[Music]

1162.64 --> 1168.48
ever wondered why we multiply

1165.679 --> 1168.48
with little g

1169.6 --> 1176.32
what is the purpose well it's to create

1173.44 --> 1176.3200000000002
a very

1176.96 --> 1180.08
it's a mechanic it's a mechanic tied

1179.6 --> 1183.12
into

1180.08 --> 1185.76
an alternative way of organizing the

1183.12 --> 1185.76
mechanics

1186.64 --> 1191.76
so when you invoke little g they are

1189.6 --> 1192.559
going by the mechanism of newtonian

1191.76 --> 1196.64
mechanics

1192.559 --> 1199.76
that assumes that that excludes gas

1196.64 --> 1201.3600000000001
technically so it ignores it within the

1199.76 --> 1202.8799999999999
spectrum of all things

1201.36 --> 1204.8799999999999
it literally ignores it that's what

1202.88 --> 1208.48
newtonian mechanics do

1204.88 --> 1208.48
and then just goes by okay

1209.36 --> 1216.6399999999999
water and rocks

1212.799 --> 1220.24
all things not gas go down go boom boom

1216.64 --> 1221.8400000000001
with yeah on earth which is technically

1220.24 --> 1225.52
in a medium of gas

1221.84 --> 1227.9189999999999
at ground level and because things go

1225.52 --> 1231.6
down go boom boom

1227.919 --> 1231.8400000000001
there is assumed to be or is calculated

1231.6 --> 1236.7199999999998
in

1231.84 --> 1236.72
an effective downwards acceleration

1236.96 --> 1241.6000000000001
push going on or it could be technically

1240.0 --> 1242.159
assumed the earth is accelerating

1241.6 --> 1244.7199999999998
upwards

1242.159 --> 1247.1200000000001
however you want to see that it's a

1244.72 --> 1250.559
mechanic at top of the calculations

1247.12 --> 1253.4399999999998
to basically quickly uh

1250.559 --> 1254.8799999999999
work in relative density disequilibrium

1253.44 --> 1257.919
displacement

1254.88 --> 1262.0
but ignoring the gas so that is

1257.919 --> 1265.8400000000001
the mechanic of of gravity

1262.0 --> 1267.679
when it is invoked mathematically

1265.84 --> 1269.52
it always has to be newtonian mechanics

1267.679 --> 1271.6000000000001
because you cannot invoke

1269.52 --> 1273.039
you can't technically invoke einstein

1271.6 --> 1275.76
gravity

1273.039 --> 1278.08
because it it deals in the non-physical

1275.76 --> 1280.64
medium you can't tie it in

1278.08 --> 1282.96
there's no use to it so people just move

1280.64 --> 1286.96
back to newtonian mechanics

1282.96 --> 1290.24
because that is the only

1286.96 --> 1292.64
left alternative route in order to grab

1290.24 --> 1293.52
onto the calculations of the physical

1292.64 --> 1295.8400000000001
realm

1293.52 --> 1296.799
from that perspective from that vantage

1295.84 --> 1299.6
point

1296.799 --> 1301.679
from the globe vantage point but yeah

1299.6 --> 1303.6789999999999
you could also just not do that

1301.679 --> 1306.48
and then just look into relative density

1303.679 --> 1310.64
that does not ignore things like gas it

1306.48 --> 1313.1200000000001
incorporates it and then get real

1310.64 --> 1313.8400000000001
but yeah then the globe is compromised

1313.12 --> 1315.6
because if you

1313.84 --> 1318.0
incorporate gas pressure in your

1315.6 --> 1320.0
modeling then you have to account for it

1318.0 --> 1322.88
especially that it will actually vent

1320.0 --> 1326.72
off in the outer space

1322.88 --> 1328.24
so and gravity can't stop that even if

1326.72 --> 1330.24
you assume it is a force

1328.24 --> 1332.48
of the strength it is presumed to be it

1330.24 --> 1334.24
cannot prevent the gas pressure from

1332.48 --> 1336.08
expanding in all directions versus the

1334.24 --> 1337.919
endless vacuum of space

1336.08 --> 1347.84
which is also presumed to be there as

1337.919 --> 1349.8400000000001
part of the heliocentric model

1347.84 --> 1350.8799999999999
all right i killed hope yeah g is a

1349.84 --> 1354.3999999999999
constant

1350.88 --> 1357.1200000000001
if you ignore all gas and pretty much at

1354.4 --> 1357.1200000000001
ground level

1358.559 --> 1361.84
that is how it is assumed

1366.08 --> 1370.08
what if there is no density well no

1368.32 --> 1375.84
density means

1370.08 --> 1375.84
very low density so it will go up

1375.919 --> 1380.64
within the container after the gas

1378.4 --> 1382.72
pressure and everything has expanded in

1380.64 --> 1383.919
all directions and met the walls of the

1382.72 --> 1387.6000000000001
container

1383.919 --> 1390.96
and then relative density displacements

1387.6 --> 1392.32
will happen and yeah the lowest density

1390.96 --> 1394.799
gas

1392.32 --> 1395.36
or conditions that might cause lower

1394.799 --> 1399.12
pressure

1395.36 --> 1401.52
will automatically make that

1399.12 --> 1403.28
that gas it's probably gas right

1401.52 --> 1406.4
evacuated gas

1403.28 --> 1409.52
low density usually gas

1406.4 --> 1413.1200000000001
it'll make it go up in relation to the

1409.52 --> 1415.679
not so low density gas

1413.12 --> 1418.2399999999998
so yeah it'll end up at the top of the

1415.679 --> 1418.24
container

1424.32 --> 1427.36
yeah well shane hayden it's very nice

1426.88 --> 1430.88
that

1427.36 --> 1431.76
yeah that gas might go down go boom boom

1430.88 --> 1435.279
in a vacuum

1431.76 --> 1439.52
but it only does that if it is contained

1435.279 --> 1440.72
in a container within that vacuum

1439.52 --> 1443.2
otherwise it's going to go in all

1440.72 --> 1445.1200000000001
directions seem to be overlooking that

1443.2 --> 1446.0800000000002
so hey if you want to suggest that the

1445.12 --> 1447.6789999999999
earth

1446.08 --> 1449.1999999999998
let's overlook that it's not really a

1447.679 --> 1450.4
ball but let's just say that it is a

1449.2 --> 1452.64
ball

1450.4 --> 1454.4
and that it is in an outer space vacuum

1452.64 --> 1455.279
well the only way the gas pressure could

1454.4 --> 1458.0800000000002
stick to

1455.279 --> 1459.279
that bowl in that case sort of is if

1458.08 --> 1463.039
there was

1459.279 --> 1466.64
similar scenario mainly a balloon

1463.039 --> 1468.96
around it around the earth in that sense

1466.64 --> 1470.159
to keep the gas pressure in because

1468.96 --> 1470.96
otherwise it's going to go in all

1470.159 --> 1473.679
directions

1470.96 --> 1475.3600000000001
just like in a vacuum chamber and gas if

1473.679 --> 1477.1200000000001
it's not contained within some kind of

1475.36 --> 1479.6
balloon in some kind of container it's

1477.12 --> 1487.84
gonna go in all directions

1479.6 --> 1487.84
so your point was exactly

1488.559 --> 1491.36
hey roger

1492.48 --> 1501.84
yeah that's right you see

1504.0 --> 1509.039
there is no absolute vacuum and there is

1507.12 --> 1510.7199999999998
no endless space that's impossible

1509.039 --> 1512.96
it's impossible it's a physical

1510.72 --> 1514.159
impossibility that there is infinite

1512.96 --> 1529.8400000000001
amount of physical

1514.159 --> 1529.8400000000001
space it's impossibility

1537.36 --> 1543.279
yeah earth passenger he's not my

1539.12 --> 1547.4399999999998
superior i don't have any superiors

1543.279 --> 1549.44
i'm my own man and i cooperate

1547.44 --> 1550.96
and i might tolerate and sometimes i

1549.44 --> 1553.919
might not tolerate

1550.96 --> 1555.679
but yeah he was he was just really

1553.919 --> 1558.72
pissed off against simon dan

1555.679 --> 1559.8400000000001
and he kind of overstepped the line a

1558.72 --> 1563.44
little

1559.84 --> 1566.9599999999998
but he did kind of apologize not

1563.44 --> 1570.3200000000002
literally but he did address the

1566.96 --> 1572.64
situation and

1570.32 --> 1575.36
that he technically did overstep his

1572.64 --> 1575.3600000000001
bound a little

1575.84 --> 1580.6399999999999
but he was just very passionate i knew

1577.919 --> 1582.48
that i was just concerned because

1580.64 --> 1584.88
i thought it was good that he was in

1582.48 --> 1585.279
chat because when nathan is addressing

1584.88 --> 1588.4
him

1585.279 --> 1590.48
for his cowardice and he's in chat

1588.4 --> 1592.4
yeah you want to see what he's going to

1590.48 --> 1594.88
be doing how is he going to squirt how

1592.4 --> 1598.5590000000002
he's going to

1594.88 --> 1602.0800000000002
yeah respond in the face of that

1598.559 --> 1602.559
and tony timing him out yeah prevented

1602.08 --> 1603.6789999999999
that

1602.559 --> 1606.1589999999999
and and i thought that was

1603.679 --> 1609.039
counterproductive so i was just trying

1606.159 --> 1609.0390000000002
to be pragmatic

1611.44 --> 1614.88
okay [ __ ] yeah yeah

1620.559 --> 1627.84
i think i should stop projecting about

1623.2 --> 1627.8400000000001
the dunning-kruger here

1628.559 --> 1633.52
are you two oh well then you're gonna go

1631.679 --> 1640.3200000000002
as well

1633.52 --> 1643.36
you don't this on my body sleeping

1640.32 --> 1643.36
warrior is awesome

1644.48 --> 1649.2
but still a human being is not flawless

1647.44 --> 1651.76
[Music]

1649.2 --> 1653.8400000000001
especially when you get passionate

1651.76 --> 1656.399
becomes like a bulldog it's very he

1653.84 --> 1658.6399999999999
finds it very hard to let go

1656.399 --> 1658.6399999999999
so

1658.73 --> 1663.1200000000001
[Music]

1660.0 --> 1665.44
but he absolutely deserves my respect

1663.12 --> 1666.559
and yours and if you're not gonna give

1665.44 --> 1669.6000000000001
it to him that's

1666.559 --> 1671.52
your problem your loss but you're not

1669.6 --> 1683.84
gonna disrespect him in my chat

1671.52 --> 1683.84
like that thank you very much

1687.279 --> 1691.36
what causes a vacuum on earth not to be

1689.679 --> 1694.8400000000001
a perfect vacuum

1691.36 --> 1696.9599999999998
well it's technically too hard to

1694.84 --> 1701.1999999999998
evacuate

1696.96 --> 1703.3600000000001
something to the supposed perfect vacuum

1701.2 --> 1705.44
it's just physical impossibility

1703.36 --> 1708.4799999999998
the pumps will not be able to gather the

1705.44 --> 1711.6000000000001
last molecules of gas

1708.48 --> 1715.76
and pull them out they won't be able to

1711.6 --> 1720.7199999999998
to have that grip i think

1715.76 --> 1720.72
how it's kind of like said but uh

1722.84 --> 1730.559
yeah the most important thing is that

1727.039 --> 1731.36
without a man-made device to create a

1730.559 --> 1734.8799999999999
vacuum

1731.36 --> 1736.84
there is no vacuum in nature

1734.88 --> 1740.96
there may be a little lower pressure

1736.84 --> 1740.9599999999998
zones there is no vacuum

1746.32 --> 1753.84
excuse me mike fox why are you straw

1749.6 --> 1753.84
manning me

1754.48 --> 1758.64
when did i ever make fun of astronauts

1762.799 --> 1767.84
i know there's a lot of flat earthers

1764.559 --> 1767.84
that like to do that

1767.919 --> 1772.64
i don't necessarily do that i will point

1770.48 --> 1772.64
out

1778.84 --> 1781.84
details

1783.679 --> 1789.279
train all their life for missions yeah

1786.72 --> 1791.3600000000001
you see the thing is when you look at

1789.279 --> 1794.0
these astronauts they don't seem like

1791.36 --> 1797.12
they've trained

1794.0 --> 1800.799
rigorously they don't seem very strong

1797.12 --> 1800.799
at all or focused

1801.279 --> 1805.279
you know so i'm just going by what they

1803.6 --> 1807.039
go so yeah i don't know what training

1805.279 --> 1808.08
they underwent but it didn't really work

1807.039 --> 1811.36
that well

1808.08 --> 1811.36
if it was so much

1811.44 --> 1815.76
you know have you ever seen the

1813.039 --> 1815.76
astronauts

1816.559 --> 1821.6789999999999
like the level of what they talk about

1819.679 --> 1823.679
when they explain things just the way

1821.679 --> 1826.88
they look

1823.679 --> 1830.3990000000001
how healthy do they look

1826.88 --> 1833.0390000000002
how fit is their body

1830.399 --> 1834.0
and all that like how how well do they

1833.039 --> 1837.84
really look

1834.0 --> 1837.84
i don't know man

1850.96 --> 1858.48
well earth passenger that my thoughts on

1854.72 --> 1858.48
civil discussions yeah of course

1859.519 --> 1862.96
you require several discussions to get a

1861.679 --> 1865.039
better understanding

1862.96 --> 1866.96
or you can listen in on somebody else's

1865.039 --> 1870.64
civil discussions

1866.96 --> 1870.64
but yeah there's a time and a place for

1876.84 --> 1882.559
everything

1879.84 --> 1883.519
most of them come from the air force

1882.559 --> 1886.08
pilots

1883.519 --> 1888.159
also they haven't actually trained all

1886.08 --> 1890.399
their lives to become astronauts

1888.159 --> 1891.44
they train all their lives to become air

1890.399 --> 1895.5189999999998
force pilots

1891.44 --> 1900.72
and then they astronaut on the side

1895.519 --> 1900.72
mike fox i think you got the order

1904.84 --> 1907.84
switched

1927.519 --> 1932.3990000000001
oh man my chat is crawling with ballers

1932.84 --> 1935.84
today

1938.11 --> 1942.799
[Music]

1939.2 --> 1945.1200000000001
why do they not trade in vacuum chambers

1942.799 --> 1946.399
yeah that's a good point alexander or

1945.12 --> 1948.32
it's because

1946.399 --> 1950.799
the spacesuits don't really work in a

1948.32 --> 1950.799
vacuum

1959.2 --> 1963.679
probably because well in extreme

1962.799 --> 1967.12
pressure

1963.679 --> 1970.24
or other way around vacuous situation

1967.12 --> 1972.4799999999998
you get to similar situations as like

1970.24 --> 1975.039
this super deep ocean

1972.48 --> 1975.519
you can't can you imagine that just

1975.039 --> 1979.12
those

1975.519 --> 1980.88
type of space suits how far would they

1979.12 --> 1982.8799999999999
go

1980.88 --> 1984.88
like in the super deep oceans in the

1982.88 --> 1988.72
mariana trench or whatever

1984.88 --> 1993.1200000000001
not very far you need like a

1988.72 --> 1996.08
yeah basically a steel robot around you

1993.12 --> 1997.039
remember like yeah you need that so a

1996.08 --> 2000.08
space suit

1997.039 --> 2003.039
it could never be just fabric like that

2000.08 --> 2004.799
it would be more like if it actually was

2003.039 --> 2007.36
supposed to be a vacuum

2004.799 --> 2008.32
around there then yeah you need a whole

2007.36 --> 2010.24
robot

2008.32 --> 2012.08
suit around you that's not going to be

2010.24 --> 2016.64
very flexible

2012.08 --> 2019.84
because yeah

2016.64 --> 2021.2
it's a very cozy idea it's like an icon

2019.84 --> 2023.84
this space suit

2021.2 --> 2024.88
right it's like they're called it's a

2023.84 --> 2028.8799999999999
culture it's a

2024.88 --> 2030.7990000000002
futurism culture but as an effective

2028.88 --> 2032.0
suit in a supposed vacuum it's

2030.799 --> 2034.1589999999999
completely useless

2032.0 --> 2035.84
so they don't train with them in a

2034.159 --> 2040.3200000000002
vacuum chamber

2035.84 --> 2044.08
you know just imagine they could

2040.32 --> 2048.3199999999997
or anybody could potentially

2044.08 --> 2053.2
rig a suit without a person in it

2048.32 --> 2056.639
like suspend it and then close it off

2053.2 --> 2058.1589999999997
pressurize it with the gas and then put

2056.639 --> 2061.76
that suit without the person

2058.159 --> 2066.7200000000003
in a vacuum chamber let's see how long

2061.76 --> 2075.8390000000004
that thing stays pressurized you know

2066.72 --> 2075.839
i don't think it'll last very long

2077.919 --> 2081.679
right because it's going to be rigid

2079.919 --> 2084.72
enough

2081.679 --> 2086.079
to counter the pressure from the inside

2084.72 --> 2088.56
from going outside

2086.079 --> 2089.44
that's the big problem so it's like you

2088.56 --> 2093.44
have to build

2089.44 --> 2097.44
a flexible gas container around you

2093.44 --> 2097.44
in order to prevent depressurizing

2098.88 --> 2102.4
and this flexible fabric and all that

2100.96 --> 2104.48
it's completely useless

2102.4 --> 2105.6800000000003
it's it's gonna blow up and it's gonna

2104.48 --> 2109.04
rip

2105.68 --> 2110.7999999999997
or it's gonna leak gonna stretch

2109.04 --> 2117.839
just a little bit too much in order for

2110.8 --> 2117.8390000000004
the gas to escape through

2154.0 --> 2158.24
prevents you from freezing well that's

2155.839 --> 2161.119
very cute mike fox but does it prevent

2158.24 --> 2163.4399999999996
you from depressurizing

2161.119 --> 2165.28
because freezing is not the problem when

2163.44 --> 2168.88
you're depressurizing

2165.28 --> 2172.2400000000002
and depressurizing the problem is

2168.88 --> 2174.96
is that the boiling temperature

2172.24 --> 2176.7999999999997
dramatically decreases of the water

2174.96 --> 2181.04
inside your body

2176.8 --> 2183.44
that's the problem cooling it

2181.04 --> 2184.32
or warming it in this case is not really

2183.44 --> 2187.359
going to help

2184.32 --> 2189.04
you it's like oh the coldness from space

2187.359 --> 2190.96
i will lose heat no no no you're going

2189.04 --> 2193.7599999999998
to depressurize

2190.96 --> 2200.41
you're going to start boiling that's a

2193.76 --> 2203.51
slightly bigger problem mike fox

2200.41 --> 2203.5099999999998
[Music]

2205.2 --> 2209.4399999999996
all right just move on to the next

2207.44 --> 2211.76
subject huh

2209.44 --> 2214.48
quickly quickly switch it doesn't work

2211.76 --> 2217.3590000000004
anymore the game is ruined let's move on

2214.48 --> 2229.839
to the next toy

2217.359 --> 2229.839
right mike fox

2231.92 --> 2236.16
that's very cute tiny wumble

2239.359 --> 2246.0
it's not that hard to pressurize a suit

2242.72 --> 2249.7599999999998
in earth atmosphere conditions

2246.0 --> 2252.16
all right it's doable might lose a

2249.76 --> 2254.8
little pressure but you can keep it up

2252.16 --> 2256.0789999999997
the issue however is that if instead of

2254.8 --> 2257.76
in regular air pressure

2256.079 --> 2259.44
surrounding you you do that same

2257.76 --> 2264.96
scenario in a vacuum

2259.44 --> 2271.839
yeah that's problematic

2264.96 --> 2271.839
it's just gonna rip through

2273.119 --> 2277.44
yeah and in deep sea the problem is not

2276.64 --> 2279.7599999999998
that the gas

2277.44 --> 2280.56
is escaping from the suit to the outside

2279.76 --> 2282.88
the problem is

2280.56 --> 2285.119
the pressure has to counter the water

2282.88 --> 2287.2000000000003
pressure

2285.119 --> 2288.2400000000002
you are going to be more under pressure

2287.2 --> 2291.2799999999997
entirely

2288.24 --> 2292.0
so you need more gas in order for it to

2291.28 --> 2293.76
properly

2292.0 --> 2295.28
dissolve in your blood as you're

2293.76 --> 2297.599
breathing it

2295.28 --> 2299.599
so it's a completely different set of

2297.599 --> 2301.2000000000003
circumstances

2299.599 --> 2304.4
pressure from the outside is very

2301.2 --> 2308.3199999999997
different as pressure from the inside

2304.4 --> 2311.44
like in a vacuum so yeah keep

2308.32 --> 2312.32
keep equating these keep keep mixing

2311.44 --> 2314.48
them up

2312.32 --> 2316.48
completely opposite situations they're

2314.48 --> 2318.32
like the same right because

2316.48 --> 2320.19
no they're not they're completely the

2318.32 --> 2323.369
opposite

2320.19 --> 2323.369
[Music]

2325.52 --> 2329.04
pressure from the outside in water

2328.0 --> 2331.359
pressure from the

2329.04 --> 2333.839
inside in a vacuum it's completely

2331.359 --> 2335.92
different a different set of forces

2333.839 --> 2337.599
that are being subjected to the

2335.92 --> 2341.359
astronaut and the suit

2337.599 --> 2345.04
completely different counter opposite

2341.359 --> 2345.04
it's completely different

2353.52 --> 2360.24
oh my god mr jones yes you do

2357.28 --> 2360.2400000000002
need more gas

2360.32 --> 2363.04
yes you do

2365.119 --> 2371.839
because you are more under pressure

2368.72 --> 2375.68
that means you also need the gas to be

2371.839 --> 2375.68
more under pressure in order to

2376.96 --> 2381.119
breathe it in otherwise you're going to

2378.88 --> 2381.6800000000003
be like why is the air suddenly getting

2381.119 --> 2387.839
so

2381.68 --> 2387.839
thin when you're going down yeah yeah

2391.359 --> 2397.839
it's pressure synchronization

2398.49 --> 2402.1699999999996
[Music]

2407.48 --> 2416.16
4.3 psi what

2411.76 --> 2425.8390000000004
oh really so how can it withstand the

2416.16 --> 2425.839
pressure from the inside then

2434.96 --> 2440.96
what pressure from the inside well the

2438.0 --> 2441.92
gas pressure from the inside everything

2440.96 --> 2444.079
on the inside

2441.92 --> 2446.4
as a whole like a balloon look a

2444.079 --> 2449.44
spacesuit is like a balloon

2446.4 --> 2452.56
in space it's gonna press

2449.44 --> 2454.88
against it in all directions

2452.56 --> 2457.2799999999997
especially because there's so much room

2454.88 --> 2459.92
outside there

2457.28 --> 2461.6800000000003
so so so much room for that gas to

2459.92 --> 2466.2400000000002
expand into

2461.68 --> 2469.5989999999997
it's gonna like

2466.24 --> 2472.16
it's gonna press itself and it's gonna

2469.599 --> 2472.1600000000003
blow up

2472.4 --> 2476.0
everything in the space suit like a

2474.079 --> 2479.3590000000004
balloon causing or

2476.0 --> 2482.4
a quick pressure differential at first

2479.359 --> 2485.7599999999998
and yeah is the fabric gonna hold

2482.4 --> 2486.319
you know how it works why can in in the

2485.76 --> 2488.88
footage

2486.319 --> 2490.8
can astronauts just do things with their

2488.88 --> 2493.28
arms when it's like fabric

2490.8 --> 2495.8390000000004
fabric that's flexible when in reality

2493.28 --> 2495.8390000000004
it should

2496.079 --> 2503.04
blow up rigidly like a stiff balloon

2499.44 --> 2503.04
absolutely inflexible

2504.0 --> 2507.28
right because that pressure yeah

2506.56 --> 2510.56
especially

2507.28 --> 2514.0
flexible fabric guys this is ridiculous

2510.56 --> 2516.24
look at that flexible fabric in a vacuum

2514.0 --> 2523.839
with pressure on the inside how are you

2516.24 --> 2523.839
going to maneuver it's ridiculous

2531.28 --> 2537.8390000000004
do they know they don't always

2537.92 --> 2551.839
that's right alec hildo that's correct

2571.76 --> 2575.119
they are seeking star wars they seem to

2573.599 --> 2578.8
be having a lot of trouble

2575.119 --> 2582.6400000000003
with figuring it out they just say

2578.8 --> 2584.5600000000004
look in the water it works

2582.64 --> 2586.64
why shouldn't it work outside in a

2584.56 --> 2590.48
vacuum well because the entire

2586.64 --> 2592.72
like why did the gas pressure tank

2590.48 --> 2595.119
explode when they drew a vacuum in it

2592.72 --> 2595.1189999999997
remember

2596.079 --> 2602.1600000000003
because it wasn't designed

2599.44 --> 2604.16
for that it was designed for pressure

2602.16 --> 2609.1189999999997
from the inside

2604.16 --> 2612.3999999999996
not from pressure on the outside so yeah

2609.119 --> 2616.1600000000003
the same goes of the comparison deep

2612.4 --> 2619.6800000000003
deep water deep mariana trench water

2616.16 --> 2620.64
pressure and the vacuum supposed vacuum

2619.68 --> 2623.1189999999997
of outer space

2620.64 --> 2625.2
or a super high earth orbit whatever you

2623.119 --> 2627.359
want to call it

2625.2 --> 2635.839
it's a world of difference the pressures

2627.359 --> 2635.839
are going to be exactly the opposite

2646.839 --> 2653.52
uh

2649.52 --> 2655.44
is designed to work in space oh really

2653.52 --> 2658.16
well why do they have flexible parts

2655.44 --> 2660.4
then like flexible fabric

2658.16 --> 2661.44
when technically that would blow up like

2660.4 --> 2664.8
a balloon

2661.44 --> 2666.56
become absolutely inflexible in actual

2664.8 --> 2668.88
vacuum

2666.56 --> 2670.0
i don't think that these spacesuits were

2668.88 --> 2673.92
designed

2670.0 --> 2674.64
for space at all think at best they were

2673.92 --> 2678.4
designed

2674.64 --> 2681.5989999999997
to be convincing

2678.4 --> 2685.2000000000003
props when using them

2681.599 --> 2687.2000000000003
underwater i think that is what they

2685.2 --> 2689.68
probably were designed for originally to

2687.2 --> 2691.4399999999996
just function as diving suits

2689.68 --> 2693.839
so they could fool the public they were

2691.44 --> 2699.119
out in outer space

2693.839 --> 2701.2799999999997
remember the helmet going full of water

2699.119 --> 2703.44
of course that was because of i don't

2701.28 --> 2705.44
know a tank of water that just started

2703.44 --> 2706.64
squirting all of a sudden in his helmet

2705.44 --> 2709.44
of course

2706.64 --> 2711.44
or it could just be a leak and just

2709.44 --> 2714.16
sipped in from the pool

2711.44 --> 2718.64
you know but i know they have an

2714.16 --> 2722.0
explanation for that and you love it

2718.64 --> 2725.359
you know you love these quick

2722.0 --> 2727.44
excuses for their blunder so much that

2725.359 --> 2729.119
yeah it'll become its own thing and i

2727.44 --> 2730.2400000000002
kind of play around with this too like

2729.119 --> 2734.2400000000002
on the debates

2730.24 --> 2738.16
i play with this so yeah

2734.24 --> 2741.359
they found a petrified wood

2738.16 --> 2743.52
on on the moon supposedly it was

2741.359 --> 2744.7999999999997
probably just in your face to screw

2743.52 --> 2747.04
around with people

2744.8 --> 2748.7200000000003
and then they say yeah because it's from

2747.04 --> 2750.96
antarctica

2748.72 --> 2752.3999999999996
because it's just like the petrified

2750.96 --> 2755.92
wood in antarctica

2752.4 --> 2759.04
makes no sense to say that well i

2755.92 --> 2760.079
am them from a creative standpoint doing

2759.04 --> 2764.16
the same as what you

2760.079 --> 2766.88
do what you ballers like to do

2764.16 --> 2769.2799999999997
make an excuse but instead of doing it

2766.88 --> 2771.839
just to prevent myself from figuring out

2769.28 --> 2774.88
it's fake i do it to play around

2771.839 --> 2776.4
and i say wait so that means that the

2774.88 --> 2780.0
moon was originally

2776.4 --> 2782.88
attached to antarctica

2780.0 --> 2784.64
and there was life on earth before ethea

2782.88 --> 2787.28
hit and then when it hit

2784.64 --> 2788.0
introduced the modern iron core then

2787.28 --> 2790.8
life died

2788.0 --> 2791.28
out or whatever things petrified the

2790.8 --> 2793.2000000000003
moon

2791.28 --> 2794.8
launched off into its orbit around the

2793.2 --> 2797.839
earth and petrified wood

2794.8 --> 2800.2400000000002
is on antarctica and very similar on the

2797.839 --> 2803.839
moon because they were attached see

2800.24 --> 2806.72
that's what i can do

2803.839 --> 2806.72
huh huh

2806.88 --> 2810.6400000000003
it's the same creative mechanism that

2809.28 --> 2813.119
you use

2810.64 --> 2815.2
to prevent yourself from snapping out of

2813.119 --> 2818.6400000000003
the suspense of disbelief i just

2815.2 --> 2818.64
use it to build

2818.88 --> 2826.48
the virtual story telling tradition

2823.2 --> 2831.2799999999997
of the whole heliocentric story concept

2826.48 --> 2833.76
which it is it's a mathematical based

2831.28 --> 2834.4
story telling tradition vantage point

2833.76 --> 2837.44
it's

2834.4 --> 2840.48
vantage point is the math to bend it all

2837.44 --> 2842.16
to make it into that globe to set

2840.48 --> 2845.52
where everything is and according to the

2842.16 --> 2848.0
observances the observations sorry

2845.52 --> 2849.52
and then created a vantage point for

2848.0 --> 2852.96
storytelling time

2849.52 --> 2856.319
well i do it too very good at it i think

2852.96 --> 2859.2400000000002
i think i'm good at it so yeah

2856.319 --> 2860.72
i just gave a legitimate reason or a

2859.24 --> 2863.9199999999996
legitimization

2860.72 --> 2866.5589999999997
as to why somebody

2863.92 --> 2868.16
said a piece of petrified wood came from

2866.559 --> 2870.2400000000002
the moon

2868.16 --> 2872.0
which logically makes no sense but i

2870.24 --> 2875.2
just justified it

2872.0 --> 2877.68
by continuing their creation story for

2875.2 --> 2877.68
the earth

2880.45 --> 2883.6299999999997
[Music]

2884.839 --> 2887.839
huh

2894.64 --> 2899.92
you don't have to time him out for that

2897.68 --> 2901.52
now the moon is definitely holographic

2899.92 --> 2903.359
because i don't think the earth is a

2901.52 --> 2905.119
ball

2903.359 --> 2908.7999999999997
and i don't think that all the heavenly

2905.119 --> 2912.48
lights are balls it's just a conception

2908.8 --> 2913.28
based on your heliocentric storytelling

2912.48 --> 2916.4
tradition

2913.28 --> 2918.559
which i'm basically invading as a

2916.4 --> 2920.559
hostile entity from the outside and

2918.559 --> 2923.52
trying to take over the storytelling

2920.559 --> 2923.52
tradition itself

2923.599 --> 2927.2000000000003
and now if the astronauts and the people

2926.88 --> 2930.2400000000002
that

2927.2 --> 2931.2799999999997
actually build it like to then they will

2930.24 --> 2935.04
probably

2931.28 --> 2936.48
listen in maybe try to actually make

2935.04 --> 2939.52
something with that because

2936.48 --> 2942.2400000000002
that's fine i don't really care it's so

2939.52 --> 2945.68
ridiculous in the first place why not

2942.24 --> 2946.16
why not use this mechanic to justify

2945.68 --> 2950.96
that

2946.16 --> 2953.1189999999997
you know turn an old silly goofy error

2950.96 --> 2954.8
if is it even or if it was like on

2953.119 --> 2957.92
purpose an error turn it

2954.8 --> 2961.04
into its own story

2957.92 --> 2963.359
why not why the hell not

2961.04 --> 2963.359
right

2964.319 --> 2970.48
the earth is not a ball anyway does it

2968.839 --> 2973.119
matter

2970.48 --> 2974.0
probably doesn't matter to them it

2973.119 --> 2977.119
doesn't mean that

2974.0 --> 2978.72
you can't just build stories they're

2977.119 --> 2980.319
doing it anyway

2978.72 --> 2984.48
they do it through astronomy and those

2980.319 --> 2987.68
stories are pretty damn freaking stupid

2984.48 --> 2990.2400000000002
and pointless some more

2987.68 --> 2992.16
philosophical extrapolation nonsense

2990.24 --> 2999.839
pointing at eugenics and evolution and

2992.16 --> 2999.839
all that [ __ ]

3010.839 --> 3013.839
ah

3019.52 --> 3024.96
well mike fox it's really cute

3022.559 --> 3026.079
that you would think that the globe

3024.96 --> 3029.2
earth

3026.079 --> 3041.8390000000004
map right that is

3029.2 --> 3041.839
correct it's not it absolutely is not

3047.119 --> 3058.96
it doesn't work out

3055.76 --> 3062.8
you know there may be some weird almost

3058.96 --> 3063.52
seeming like special non-linearity going

3062.8 --> 3065.92
on that may

3063.52 --> 3068.4
suggest somewhat in the direction of the

3065.92 --> 3070.48
earth sort of being a girl but it's not

3068.4 --> 3072.079
like it it's not it doesn't even match

3070.48 --> 3074.88
up

3072.079 --> 3077.599
like the antarctic situation it's

3074.88 --> 3081.2000000000003
extremely unlikely that that is all

3077.599 --> 3083.839
literally an island that doesn't match

3081.2 --> 3083.839
up at all

3084.0 --> 3089.359
not saying that there is no land mass

3087.04 --> 3089.359
there

3089.44 --> 3100.48
but it's not an island

3096.559 --> 3100.48
it's not an island at the end

3102.0 --> 3105.92
in the south like that doesn't it's not

3105.04 --> 3111.839
that small

3105.92 --> 3111.839
at least

3115.359 --> 3125.839
oh yeah yeah smart ass okay it's it's

3118.24 --> 3125.839
time to stop spamming now

3131.52 --> 3135.119
no explanation for the different star

3133.44 --> 3137.76
trails yeah

3135.119 --> 3139.52
very different i know there's an

3137.76 --> 3140.4
explanation for it i gave it to you but

3139.52 --> 3141.68
you ignore it

3140.4 --> 3143.52
because probably because you don't

3141.68 --> 3146.48
understand because you can't

3143.52 --> 3148.64
migrate your thinking outside of your

3146.48 --> 3150.48
heliocentric vantage point because it's

3148.64 --> 3153.7599999999998
too tough for you

3150.48 --> 3156.559
yeah i did explain it it's all

3153.76 --> 3158.48
lights your lights have angular

3156.559 --> 3162.079
relations to the observer

3158.48 --> 3164.8
and the position of the earth over time

3162.079 --> 3165.44
in consistent patterns none of them are

3164.8 --> 3169.76
physical

3165.44 --> 3173.04
bodies anywhere just light manifest

3169.76 --> 3176.6400000000003
over the earth over the flat earth

3173.04 --> 3178.24
and the patterns differ in the north and

3176.64 --> 3181.359
the south

3178.24 --> 3185.04
it's like this virtual not literal

3181.359 --> 3187.839
globe of stars is turning around you

3185.04 --> 3190.079
and then you see the other side that's

3187.839 --> 3193.359
what that is

3190.079 --> 3196.48
virtual it's holographic that's the

3193.359 --> 3198.7999999999997
explanation explanation

3196.48 --> 3198.8
right

3200.72 --> 3205.1189999999997
you didn't back it up with evidence

3202.72 --> 3206.9599999999996
neither did you to just suggest that it

3205.119 --> 3208.319
must be a globe of stars and the earth

3206.96 --> 3212.559
must be a glow beneath

3208.319 --> 3212.5589999999997
it's not proof either mr jones

3217.92 --> 3221.119
you ask for an explanation i gave you

3220.0 --> 3222.88
one

3221.119 --> 3224.7200000000003
to then say oh you don't have proof for

3222.88 --> 3228.319
that well you don't have proof

3224.72 --> 3232.7999999999997
of your globe presupposition either

3228.319 --> 3236.0
so hey don't be

3232.8 --> 3238.1600000000003
don't be a sore loser

3236.0 --> 3239.2
it's the best oh you think your

3238.16 --> 3244.48
explanation

3239.2 --> 3246.72
is the best well that's good for you

3244.48 --> 3248.64
i think it's disproven because it rests

3246.72 --> 3249.04
on certain presuppositions that have

3248.64 --> 3253.1189999999997
been

3249.04 --> 3256.8
blatantly obviously disproven

3253.119 --> 3261.119
and reflect that

3256.8 --> 3263.76
on a daily basis for years now

3261.119 --> 3265.6800000000003
now that you ignore it and just keep

3263.76 --> 3269.28
staring at that explanation and

3265.68 --> 3269.2799999999997
thinking it's the best that's your

3276.839 --> 3279.839
problem

3283.04 --> 3289.04
oh you can confirm he can confirm oh

3286.16 --> 3292.96
[ __ ] off man

3289.04 --> 3296.0
sick of this

3292.96 --> 3296.96
mr jones you're you are literally a a

3296.0 --> 3300.0
glober not

3296.96 --> 3304.839
a normie you are a glober glober

3300.0 --> 3307.599
like jam panda rumpus xanax level global

3304.839 --> 3309.839
jesus

3307.599 --> 3311.119
you can see it by how easily he just

3309.839 --> 3316.24
maneuvers his own

3311.119 --> 3319.2000000000003
ignorance because they do that

3316.24 --> 3320.3999999999996
what do they have to ignore in order to

3319.2 --> 3323.2
continue their

3320.4 --> 3324.079
globe belief that's the tactic what that

3323.2 --> 3326.0789999999997
globers follow

3324.079 --> 3328.319
you can literally see it happen on the

3326.079 --> 3331.52
spot

3328.319 --> 3334.319
by how easily they tumble into mistake

3331.52 --> 3335.52
by mistake because they have to we see

3334.319 --> 3339.2
it is a mistake

3335.52 --> 3340.24
to them it's mandatory it's part of the

3339.2 --> 3343.1189999999997
journey

3340.24 --> 3349.839
of reinforcing the religious conception

3343.119 --> 3354.0
of the globe

3349.839 --> 3354.0
right i'm gonna round out the show soon

3360.559 --> 3368.1600000000003
yeah thanks dank so

3364.799 --> 3372.16
ah that's a good show today i think

3368.16 --> 3372.16
very active lots of ballers

3372.96 --> 3379.04
haven't had that many ballers in chat

3375.68 --> 3379.04
squirting so much since

3379.119 --> 3383.44
since some time anyway thanks everyone

3382.72 --> 3385.2799999999997
for coming
