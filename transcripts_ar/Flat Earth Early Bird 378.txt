wide I don't see any actual thing nope

346.06 --> 349.17
what's going on

374.85 --> 378.019
[Music]

385.19 --> 391.18
are you guys starting off a a discussion

388.46 --> 391.18
without me

410.79 --> 414.019
[Music]

422.96 --> 428.02
a Mariano's it's flat lotty

452.48 --> 457.97
yeah Robin Stanley that that's that's a

456.39 --> 460.83
very good point

457.97 --> 462.78000000000003
indeed man-made climate change skeptics

460.83 --> 468.9
are battling the same science called

462.78 --> 473.72999999999996
science culture as that we do yes you're

468.9 --> 479.46
totally correct and that is interesting

473.73 --> 483.57
about it is there's been manifesting

479.46 --> 487.65
such a polarization and it's reinforced

483.57 --> 493.89
by yeah politicization basically

487.65 --> 496.97999999999996
everybody's forced to split up in either

493.89 --> 500.28
you are gonna be telling the truth about

496.98 --> 501.63
something but something that you're not

500.28 --> 507.75
supposed to be telling the truth about

501.63 --> 514.71
according to the system or you're not

507.75 --> 517.349
and if you are then you're kind of in

514.71 --> 521.76
the same boat with the other groups even

517.349 --> 526.099
though you may have like yeah grievances

521.76 --> 526.099
about what they do or what they say

529.47 --> 536.25
and they a lot of people especially the

533.64 --> 538.59
alternative media there they have a lot

536.25 --> 541.65
of mistakes as it were and you could

538.59 --> 544.77
yeah sometimes think might be like a

541.65 --> 546.72
tactic to drag in more people that are

544.77 --> 551.64
kind of making the same mistakes to try

546.72 --> 554.4300000000001
to correct them maybe but yeah that that

551.64 --> 559.77
will cause a lot of inner friction with

554.43 --> 563.06
more purists in a way like myself and

559.77 --> 566.1
though I'm extremely tolerant by nature

563.06 --> 570.8399999999999
but technically we are all in the same

566.1 --> 574.5
boat we are trying to put in truths said

570.84 --> 580.9200000000001
the whole diversity of very important

574.5 --> 583.59
issues and yet every part matters and

580.92 --> 588.99
they're attacking it roughly all at once

583.59 --> 594.72
so we're kind of forced or is it the

588.99 --> 600.05
team up in this fight whether really

594.72 --> 602.4
kind of like it or not so and yeah I

600.05 --> 605.3599999999999
still think that we have a good chance

602.4 --> 605.36
with the truth here

614.54 --> 623.2099999999999
yeah indeed Gaffin read

618.29 --> 624.92
I haven't actually double-checked that

623.21 --> 629.21
on my own channel yet but I definitely

624.92 --> 632.15
heard and Owen Benjamin announced that

629.21 --> 634.85
his channel was very likely to be

632.15 --> 641.09
deleted of course he still has

634.85 --> 644.3000000000001
unauthorized TV so yeah it's not gonna

641.09 --> 646.4300000000001
be stopped not really and yeah the more

644.3 --> 652.39
this is going on the more I really want

646.43 --> 658.4499999999999
to actually subscribe to his site

652.39 --> 661.84
because I really like what he does and

658.45 --> 666.26
he makes me laugh very very

661.84 --> 671.0600000000001
uncontrollably hard sometimes and yeah I

666.26 --> 675.17
need that sometimes so but yeah for now

671.06 --> 677.5
he's also undie life by the way that's

675.17 --> 677.5
funny

682.8 --> 689.01
let's see let me find the channel see if

686.17 --> 689.01
it is the leader

713.709 --> 723.529
hmm well the channels are still there

719.269 --> 727.339
no has been terminated Wow okay it

723.529 --> 731.6899999999999
didn't even show like the icon has not

727.339 --> 733.399
been removed from my subscriber list but

731.69 --> 737.889
maybe that takes on the out the Owen

733.399 --> 737.889
Benjamin comedy still there by the way

741.1 --> 746.509
so yeah he has several accounts and

744.529 --> 751.519
usually when one of them gets a strike

746.509 --> 755.029
he just hops onto another and eventually

751.519 --> 757.61
always puts his dreams onto his own

755.029 --> 762.009
website but it seems that the main

757.61 --> 762.009
channel has indeed been deleted

777.899 --> 780.899
yeah

792.8 --> 796.899
you know I think at this point that

798.1 --> 807.97
YouTube has been widely designated by

805.01 --> 810.529
the corporate world to self-destruct I

807.97 --> 818.72
think that the platform has been too

810.529 --> 825.83
efficient to it help people learn too

818.72 --> 828.83
much too quickly and I think that the

825.83 --> 831.11
controller's basically are yeah getting

828.83 --> 833.4200000000001
the preliminary data from this and if

831.11 --> 835.88
just think like no this is this is too

833.42 --> 838.67
far this is too fast we can't allow this

835.88 --> 843.62
so I think that yeah by corporate

838.67 --> 847.55
structure by orders it is being

843.62 --> 849.589
dismantled through censorship it's doing

847.55 --> 852.62
by itself for political reasons I think

849.589 --> 855.2900000000001
they're literally just trying to destroy

852.62 --> 859.04
the system to then replace some kind of

855.29 --> 865.779
mega controlled corporate platforms in

859.04 --> 871.16
its dead part of the original internet -

865.779 --> 873.5889999999999
idea but it's it's a shame and I wish it

871.16 --> 878.63
could be prevented because YouTube has

873.589 --> 882.74
been great it still is a great system

878.63 --> 885.68
and a great idea and it has still the

882.74 --> 889.7
public feeling to it even though yeah

885.68 --> 893.209
the corporate system of it top-down is

889.7 --> 895.7900000000001
trying to cram it together and try to

893.209 --> 897.8199999999999
corporatize the whole thing and that's

895.79 --> 902.5999999999999
terrible

897.82 --> 906.649
I'm really sad about the concept of that

902.6 --> 910.64
they might succeed at it because yeah

906.649 --> 913.13
for me it would I would it yeah I

910.64 --> 914.98
probably would be come under a lot more

913.13 --> 917.93
pressure and

914.98 --> 921.0790000000001
what's the use of it if I can't just be

917.93 --> 923.9
myself and say the things as as I see

921.079 --> 926.63
fit and do my best

923.9 --> 932.9599999999999
not to harm anyone but to inform them

926.63 --> 936.68
carefully that's what I liked about you

932.96 --> 944.45
too and if there's something shitty in

936.68 --> 952.4799999999999
there zap away and subscribe and if you

944.45 --> 952.48
like it not that's how it works it's

953.23 --> 959.2
that's how it should be

955.99 --> 966.35
then I hope that I don't know some

959.2 --> 971.1800000000001
somehow it's gonna be stopped but yeah

966.35 --> 975.0500000000001
who would do that like who could

971.18 --> 978.38
actually do that with YouTube I think

975.05 --> 985.279
that it would be the American government

978.38 --> 987.83
right technically Alex Jones has been

985.279 --> 989.99
calling for this to Trump kind of like

987.83 --> 991.5200000000001
almost desperately for a long time like

989.99 --> 997.3100000000001
yeah they're going too far you got to

991.52 --> 998.66
stop the censorship and how YouTube and

997.31 --> 1000.5799999999999
Google and what they're doing what

998.66 --> 1003.9699999999999
they'd done to the algorithm and yeah um

1000.58 --> 1006.85
has an act doesn't seem to be doing a

1003.97 --> 1013.36
lot about it does some talk here and

1006.85 --> 1018.7
there you know but we don't need moral

1013.36 --> 1021.16
support we need

1018.7 --> 1024.28
yeah it to be stopped by somebody that

1021.16 --> 1026.97
can actually do that to make it into

1024.28 --> 1026.97
something better

1030.93 --> 1043.5
and I hope the Trump will somehow find a

1034.92 --> 1045.39
way again himself to do it or maybe he's

1043.5 --> 1046.98
just yeah that's always what people

1045.39 --> 1049.0500000000002
think like oh no he's just waiting for

1046.98 --> 1054.8600000000001
the right time he planned it all ahead I

1049.05 --> 1054.86
don't know it would be great if he had

1056.66 --> 1066.24
but if he hasn't then I think he

1059.91 --> 1069.21
underestimate what it'll do not just to

1066.24 --> 1072.93
America but to the world and this design

1069.21 --> 1075.06
it gives off as to what America yeah it

1072.93 --> 1079.44
is an American corporation what America

1075.06 --> 1082.3799999999999
is really about you know the image of

1079.44 --> 1084.78
freedom of speech you know that that's

1082.38 --> 1087.63
gonna have a hard yeah it's gonna have a

1084.78 --> 1091.47
tough time you know it'll take away from

1087.63 --> 1105.23
the glory of America you could say the

1091.47 --> 1105.23
appeal of it so you know anyway

1107.6 --> 1116.9089999999999
all scripted in politics all plan sure

1112.77 --> 1121.77
Stacy be everything does seem extremely

1116.909 --> 1124.919
strip scripted but who actually does the

1121.77 --> 1129.36
scriptwriting and how does the hierarchy

1124.919 --> 1137.73
in that work I don't think there's great

1129.36 --> 1140.7299999999998
clarity about that you know so yeah

1137.73 --> 1145.789
they're not all drones remote-controlled

1140.73 --> 1148.14
literally you know it's not that bad

1145.789 --> 1151.02
even though at times it may seem like

1148.14 --> 1152.97
that especially when they feel they need

1151.02 --> 1155.7
to do something that I really don't like

1152.97 --> 1159.3500000000001
or something yeah they definitely seem

1155.7 --> 1159.3500000000001
like they're puppets at such times

1163.24 --> 1166.329
[Music]

1175.35 --> 1191.01
well intentionally space out you know he

1182.86 --> 1191.01
does these things but why what is that

1191.22 --> 1203.8600000000001
that's just that's terrible on a plane I

1197.1 --> 1206.6499999999999
just don't know like he may be like

1203.86 --> 1208.81
trying to pull strings or applying

1206.65 --> 1212.89
social engineering on a level that we

1208.81 --> 1215.35
don't really understand because he well

1212.89 --> 1218.68
he is a connected guy it's like one of

1215.35 --> 1223.4499999999998
his things we use it as a business man

1218.68 --> 1226.23
so his four sites you don't know exactly

1223.45 --> 1230.17
like what he's trying to achieve with

1226.23 --> 1232.42
acting like a clan now he's not just

1230.17 --> 1238.48
doing that because he thinks it's funny

1232.42 --> 1242.97
I think he's trying to achieve something

1238.48 --> 1242.97
with that and it's

1244.22 --> 1249.83
yeah the responses are like multi-layer

1247.519 --> 1252.679
you could you see like oh of course he's

1249.83 --> 1256.009
an idiot didn't the whole Trump phobia

1252.679 --> 1258.98
nonsense or you could say like yeah what

1256.009 --> 1262.49
is he doing is he like in a bad mood or

1258.98 --> 1265.19
something or she pissed off and then you

1262.49 --> 1268.94
could say but could this be a specific

1265.19 --> 1275.23
message response to somebody had a back

1268.94 --> 1275.23
room talk with like a code what is it

1275.769 --> 1285.83
right secret societies yes you know he

1282.35 --> 1290.24
is connected in ways don't exactly

1285.83 --> 1293.149
understand how but he's yeah I must be

1290.24 --> 1295.1
so is easy applying secret

1293.149 --> 1298.0089999999998
communications here and there just or

1295.1 --> 1302.2099999999998
well not secret communications just more

1298.009 --> 1305.21
like designations it it can be extremely

1302.21 --> 1307.659
complicated guys look secret societies

1305.21 --> 1311.6290000000001
where like only now afterwards

1307.659 --> 1313.8200000000002
unraveling things right like tricks they

1311.629 --> 1318.289
use and Street codes and so very

1313.82 --> 1321.2
exciting but who's to say that those

1318.289 --> 1323.98
people haven't kind of updated their

1321.2 --> 1337.31
trick book to more modern day standards

1323.98 --> 1350.56
you know do you know so

1337.31 --> 1350.56
I dunno yeah

1351.65 --> 1361.91
well I haven't really decided on the

1354.49 --> 1363.71
multi-layer approach of it all well the

1361.91 --> 1367.13
base Trump allergy approach is

1363.71 --> 1370.43
definitely not it and I sometimes really

1367.13 --> 1374.21
do get the idea the man is every old

1370.43 --> 1376.64
human being has issues and it seems like

1374.21 --> 1382.28
some of the things he does comes from

1376.64 --> 1386.5700000000002
that on the other hand yeah you only get

1382.28 --> 1389.42
to see what you get to see through

1386.57 --> 1391.58
cameras for reports and of course

1389.42 --> 1395.0
there's misinformation fake news also go

1391.58 --> 1398.09
I'm very blatantly sometimes a little

1395.0 --> 1401.03
bit more complex but does that mean you

1398.09 --> 1404.51
know everything about what transpires

1401.03 --> 1406.61
about like what all his business

1404.51 --> 1409.429
relations are all about now not trying

1406.61 --> 1413.8899999999999
to hint at anything creepy it's just

1409.429 --> 1415.8090000000002
that yeah a connected man will pick up

1413.89 --> 1421.8500000000001
communication tricks

1415.809 --> 1425.0
signs then he may be trying to maneuver

1421.85 --> 1432.1699999999998
achieve things that are not so blatantly

1425.0 --> 1436.19
obvious at the time so as a New Yorker

1432.17 --> 1439.0900000000001
we always loved hated him yeah but he

1436.19 --> 1442.0900000000001
isn't he is a quite a character you know

1439.09 --> 1442.09
like

1443.52 --> 1448.1299999999999
and he's always been quite a character

1472.14 --> 1475.7990000000002
yeah mark colored he does that

1474.62 --> 1480.84
absolutely

1475.799 --> 1484.79
it's his baseline approach it's how he

1480.84 --> 1488.04
kind of does business in a way or how he

1484.79 --> 1497.37
influences his image it's what he does

1488.04 --> 1501.299
oh my god Tom Parker I can't believe you

1497.37 --> 1508.1399999999999
actually let that out I can't believe

1501.299 --> 1510.72
you I am just getting really disgusted

1508.14 --> 1513.929
by my chat right now not just you I

1510.72 --> 1520.1000000000001
can't believe you guys are slapping

1513.929 --> 1520.1000000000001
there what are you doing to yourself

1527.63 --> 1535.5
[Music]

1530.01 --> 1539.49
I had no choice oh you had to you had to

1535.5 --> 1547.35
throw that Trump allergy out you had to

1539.49 --> 1554.04
do it yeah yeah you know what that makes

1547.35 --> 1557.1899999999998
you pop it up pop it pop it I got the

1554.04 --> 1565.6689999999999
program you were conditioned to respond

1557.19 --> 1565.669
and you had to do it yeah awkward indeed

1573.03 --> 1578.97
I'm serious guys you know I'm not say I

1576.809 --> 1583.23
never said Trump was like the perfect

1578.97 --> 1587.8700000000001
guy but you're falling into a very low

1583.23 --> 1591.27
down railroad it's because of the

1587.87 --> 1597.539
magnitude of the sheer violence towards

1591.27 --> 1600.809
this character so most mythology is

1597.539 --> 1604.559
negatively and that echoes on and people

1600.809 --> 1608.1299999999999
will do the trick

1604.559 --> 1610.9189999999999
they will do the signalling that is what

1608.13 --> 1614.909
that is guys recognize it in you and you

1610.919 --> 1618.929
don't don't allow your mind to go there

1614.909 --> 1621.0590000000002
it's really dumb it's base it's

1618.929 --> 1624.24
immediately you go down into the

1621.059 --> 1625.6499999999999
[ __ ] that's where you assume things

1624.24 --> 1629.36
are and that's where you're going to be

1625.65 --> 1629.3600000000001
dwelling as a consequence

1632.73 --> 1640.14
yeah good servant it's fake but you got

1635.58 --> 1643.1899999999998
to know what is fake about it and what

1640.14 --> 1643.19
is really going on

1661.71 --> 1666.5900000000001
and it brings me peace okay good servant

1668.63 --> 1677.19
look you don't have to go there like I

1672.53 --> 1682.23
don't dwell on Trump a lot but I do

1677.19 --> 1684.72
always kind of keep an eye on him but

1682.23 --> 1690.32
I'm not gonna be sitting in that hole

1684.72 --> 1694.56
getting attacked and defending and I I

1690.32 --> 1696.75
just want people to stop falling for

1694.56 --> 1701.9099999999999
that bait and you don't fall for that

1696.75 --> 1704.88
date by choosing one side you don't fall

1701.91 --> 1708.24
for that bait by moving past it and just

1704.88 --> 1712.5900000000001
seeing that what's going on and then

1708.24 --> 1717.9
just going with that information what

1712.59 --> 1721.22
you figure out and not be judging so not

1717.9 --> 1721.22
focusing on that so much

1724.6 --> 1727.6599999999999
[Music]

1743.78 --> 1749.289
[Music]

1745.71 --> 1751.929
hmm yep Robin Stanley well that's what

1749.289 --> 1754.75
it's supposed to be but the problem is

1751.929 --> 1757.8990000000001
is that the federal government has kind

1754.75 --> 1760.99
of imperialize a lot of how the United

1757.899 --> 1764.6789999999999
States work so that original clean

1760.99 --> 1767.889
position that constitutional system is

1764.679 --> 1771.21
kind of slightly by past with Patriot

1767.889 --> 1775.299
Act's for starters and a lot of others

1771.21 --> 1777.549
so the problem is a lot of these checks

1775.299 --> 1780.279
and balances effectively don't really

1777.549 --> 1783.6689999999999
work that well anymore at least on the

1780.279 --> 1785.169
short term that's saying that yeah and

1783.669 --> 1787.929
the problem is is that a lot of

1785.169 --> 1790.72
politicians are kind of abusing that and

1787.929 --> 1793.419
makes it very tough for somebody like

1790.72 --> 1796.98
Trump who's not he's obviously not

1793.419 --> 1796.98
trying to corrupt okay

1798.539 --> 1805.4089999999999
he may be corrupting in some ways but he

1802.33 --> 1810.72
doesn't want that Mike that's so obvious

1805.409 --> 1814.6290000000001
he's not like an evil guy like that

1810.72 --> 1818.409
that doesn't make any sense to me that's

1814.629 --> 1821.23
not what I get from him but the problem

1818.409 --> 1824.2890000000002
is because the checks and balances don't

1821.23 --> 1826.809
really work out it's very tough to

1824.289 --> 1829.2
effectively do something without using

1826.809 --> 1834.25
the Imperial tools because everyone else

1829.2 --> 1837.82
in the palace the Empire is also using

1834.25 --> 1839.74
them still and then unraveling all that

1837.82 --> 1844.84
is extremely complicated because there's

1839.74 --> 1847.779
traps all over those those laws that had

1844.84 --> 1850.86
been put there and stakes and groups

1847.779 --> 1854.62
that are certainly gonna break off and

1850.86 --> 1857.35
cause on it's destabilizing to suddenly

1854.62 --> 1860.0189999999998
change it all but he tried as fast as he

1857.35 --> 1862.7099999999998
could in the beginning like remember the

1860.019 --> 1866.379
revoking of the TPP and all that

1862.71 --> 1869.22
immediately but that is really as far as

1866.379 --> 1873.4289999999999
he could go quickly because the rest

1869.22 --> 1876.29
will probably destabilize a lot and then

1873.429 --> 1878.8700000000001
he can't do his thing then he

1876.29 --> 1884.0
and work his business magic now it seems

1878.87 --> 1887.9599999999998
now that in the end yeah he got a pretty

1884.0 --> 1888.42
good go but now it's getting really

1887.96 --> 1891.599
tough

1888.42 --> 1891.5990000000002
[Music]

1894.39 --> 1898.43
so we uh yeah

1901.46 --> 1904.559
[Music]

1917.01 --> 1927.76
what Trump is on a coin no well good

1925.299 --> 1930.04
servant that is good I'm not telling

1927.76 --> 1937.02
people to get involved necessarily I'm

1930.04 --> 1937.02
just trying to clear up some things

1957.5 --> 1960.19
yeah

1975.2 --> 1982.3700000000001
right well Robin Stanley in the end the

1979.01 --> 1986.21
original Constitution and the proper

1982.37 --> 1990.9699999999998
form of government by that Constitution

1986.21 --> 1996.05
should be enforced by the people yeah

1990.97 --> 2001.48
how do you do that once an empire takes

1996.05 --> 2004.24
its roots how do you still get it out

2001.48 --> 2005.95
from its yeah the further the stronger

2004.24 --> 2008.02
it becomes the tougher it is for the

2005.95 --> 2010.95
people to actually enforce that

2008.02 --> 2010.95
Constitution

2015.41 --> 2018.5890000000002
[Music]

2019.36 --> 2022.779
so yeah

2027.27 --> 2033.97
all right yeah the best you can do

2031.179 --> 2036.6100000000001
in my opinion it's a general advice is

2033.97 --> 2039.67
always just be aware of the

2036.61 --> 2043.08
constitutional rights how they truly

2039.67 --> 2047.0800000000002
apply and also the complications with

2043.08 --> 2049.149
policies police officers and all that Bo

2047.08 --> 2057.04
try to be as aware of where as possible

2049.149 --> 2062.02
and yeah make sure that the people by

2057.04 --> 2064.48
their awareness of this prevent the yeah

2062.02 --> 2067.119
aggravation of the corruption of the

2064.48 --> 2070.27
whole thing the furthering of the

2067.119 --> 2074.08
imperial ization try to hold it as much

2070.27 --> 2075.85
as possible so that yeah everyone the

2074.08 --> 2079.0499999999997
public the government itself can

2075.85 --> 2084.5499999999997
potentially has a chance to sweat out

2079.05 --> 2087.4190000000003
the darkest perpetrators the biggest

2084.55 --> 2087.4190000000003
imperialists

2090.78 --> 2095.159
and hope it's gonna work out yep

2112.17 --> 2114.86
it

2116.49 --> 2122.0699999999997
okay but anyway I'll drop the subject

2118.95 --> 2126.839
because you all seem to be totally just

2122.07 --> 2129.3
crashing into this this parapet and I

2126.839 --> 2131.07
guess especially for the people from the

2129.3 --> 2137.5800000000004
United States you must be so bombarded

2131.07 --> 2139.94
by all that [ __ ] must be driving you

2137.58 --> 2139.94
nuts

2146.72 --> 2149.3799999999997
Wow

2151.61 --> 2160.34
oh okay

2157.54 --> 2170.3
okay Tom Parker yeah that is kind of

2160.34 --> 2177.67
uncanny and weird what Donald Trump half

2170.3 --> 2177.67
a shekel coin with King Cyrus this is

2179.71 --> 2192.05
but like did what did he condone this or

2189.02 --> 2196.13
is this somebody just super hard

2192.05 --> 2199.09
trolling him this is like Nick Fuentes

2196.13 --> 2199.09
uncle or something

2201.97 --> 2204.66
what

2205.83 --> 2216.5099999999998
and he changed me to build him a house

2209.25 --> 2218.82
in Jerusalem well yeah that is yeah I'll

2216.51 --> 2225.0
share it for a second that is weird

2218.82 --> 2232.1400000000003
but yeah again it seems Trump has kind

2225.0 --> 2236.28
of like chosen Israel ties its yeah you

2232.14 --> 2240.2599999999998
could say a highly controversial at this

2236.28 --> 2249.11
time political decision for geopolitical

2240.26 --> 2254.9300000000003
maneuvering and right anyway I'm gonna

2249.11 --> 2254.9300000000003
share this gonna share the other

2260.81 --> 2263.62
come on

2289.77 --> 2293.84
right that's the one I wanted

2294.789 --> 2306.1400000000003
okay so yeah this one that that's

2300.349 --> 2308.839
another one a half shekel King Cyrus

2306.14 --> 2315.8289999999997
it's a golden coin limited edition oh

2308.839 --> 2318.2889999999998
wait I it's not just 143 that's just two

2315.829 --> 2326.7490000000003
shipping shipping cost anyway let's see

2318.289 --> 2329.289
if I can yeah yeah that certainly is

2326.749 --> 2329.2889999999998
special

2335.9 --> 2339.039
there's the other one

2343.03 --> 2345.6600000000003
yeah

2347.13 --> 2354.4100000000003
yeah terms doesn't definitely seems to

2351.239 --> 2354.41
like Israel

2358.74 --> 2363.2599999999998
and he's probably a fan of the Old

2361.14 --> 2363.2599999999998
Testament

2379.97 --> 2383.1299999999997
[Music]

2386.99 --> 2390.06
[Music]

2402.95 --> 2407.3799999999997
okay mark colored how about Ron Paul

2425.17 --> 2433.09
did you know that Ron Paul actually

2427.49 --> 2437.0899999999997
started a a whole video library

2433.09 --> 2446.1400000000003
specifically for high level home

2437.09 --> 2448.76
schooling education wrong Paul is in

2446.14 --> 2457.91
politics he even tried to run for

2448.76 --> 2461.8300000000004
president one time remember so don't

2457.91 --> 2461.83
over generalize too hastily

2471.08 --> 2474.61
won't win oh really

2476.39 --> 2486.1
you know there's another guy in politics

2480.86 --> 2486.1
they used to say that about right

2487.75 --> 2495.7
remember that he's currently the

2492.95 --> 2495.7
president

2503.92 --> 2513.7000000000003
now I think it's really up to the people

2506.559 --> 2515.7690000000002
and also it's a matter of fasting for

2513.7 --> 2518.859
the people the people must decide to

2515.769 --> 2523.1189999999997
step away from the Imperial tools not to

2518.859 --> 2529.089
go with the programs for some financial

2523.119 --> 2533.319
benefit and everyone must be just

2529.089 --> 2535.269
willing to do that for a good reason it

2533.319 --> 2538.5099999999998
must be viable it must be made into a

2535.269 --> 2547.72
viable option not to become a war empire

2538.51 --> 2549.73
anymore not to become is it not to be

2547.72 --> 2553.779
fooled around with by the CIA and all

2549.73 --> 2557.069
that that the shadow Empire imperial

2553.779 --> 2562.18
part of it to not go with that kind of

2557.069 --> 2566.44
that type of power anymore and then yeah

2562.18 --> 2575.44
Ron Paul he's always been very correct

2566.44 --> 2578.65
with that well never for war so right

2575.44 --> 2581.579
but it's the thirst as Owen Benjamin

2578.65 --> 2584.289
calls it's the thirst America is very

2581.579 --> 2588.42
thirsty and they just can't stop

2584.289 --> 2588.42
drinking from that fountain

2638.28 --> 2646.0600000000004
nomads lingard now that's the thing

2642.79 --> 2650.5299999999997
there is no such thing as a presupposed

2646.06 --> 2653.52
container if there's gas pressure there

2650.53 --> 2656.5600000000004
must be a container it's not matter of

2653.52 --> 2664.8
presupposition it must be there it's a

2656.56 --> 2668.59
natural law the only thing that is left

2664.8 --> 2670.48
to figure out is what is the size where

2668.59 --> 2673.15
are the barriers how do they function

2670.48 --> 2677.11
what is going on but the container is

2673.15 --> 2681.4300000000003
there because we have gas pressure it's

2677.11 --> 2684.4300000000003
not a presupposition no no that is not a

2681.43 --> 2689.1099999999997
presupposition it's a natural law do you

2684.43 --> 2692.08
know what that means Matt lingard it's

2689.11 --> 2696.07
not a presupposition to say in order for

2692.08 --> 2699.19
gas pressure to be there there must be a

2696.07 --> 2704.32
container no that's a natural law it's

2699.19 --> 2710.83
not a presupposition that doesn't matter

2704.32 --> 2713.61
if nobody found the container it has to

2710.83 --> 2716.89
be there otherwise gas pressure cannot

2713.61 --> 2720.3900000000003
settle the way it does unless unless you

2716.89 --> 2723.49
are ready to concede that the entire

2720.39 --> 2725.44
presupposed outer space universe never

2723.49 --> 2727.27
physically confirmed presupposed yeah

2725.44 --> 2730.18
unless you want to go with NASA and

2727.27 --> 2734.0099999999998
nonsense presuppose outerspace universe

2730.18 --> 2737.5
is not a vacuum and it's all pretty much

2734.01 --> 2740.3500000000004
gas pressure just like the earth maybe a

2737.5 --> 2743.02
little less but not an out of space now

2740.35 --> 2745.7799999999997
if you're gonna go with that well yeah

2743.02 --> 2750.16
then you have accounted for the universe

2745.78 --> 2751.9
container colossal size then you got

2750.16 --> 2756.31
gradient problems because that makes

2751.9 --> 2758.26
very little sense but yeah in order for

2756.31 --> 2760.48
gas pressure to be there there has to be

2758.26 --> 2762.82
a container must be that's the natural

2760.48 --> 2765.97
law you can demonstrate the opposite you

2762.82 --> 2767.84
cannot provide evidence that counters

2765.97 --> 2770.99
the natural law

2767.84 --> 2772.4900000000002
and unless you can Matt lingard unless

2770.99 --> 2774.14
you can actually demonstrate gas

2772.49 --> 2775.85
pressure without a container remember

2774.14 --> 2783.95
it's a housekeeping question at the Flat

2775.85 --> 2788.2999999999997
Earth debates oh hey thanks

2783.95 --> 2790.5499999999997
insanity is sanity for the 533 dollar

2788.3 --> 2792.8900000000003
super chat donation sorry for being an

2790.55 --> 2794.42
ass in the past good guy keep up the

2792.89 --> 2800.74
good work and have a beer on me well

2794.42 --> 2800.7400000000002
thank you man I if there's been any

2801.46 --> 2806.9
transgression or like you've been mean

2803.66 --> 2812.5699999999997
or whatever you know in the past ya

2806.9 --> 2814.76
thinks it happens it's okay you know

2812.57 --> 2816.5
I've been kind of an ask to people as

2814.76 --> 2820.1000000000004
well that in retrospect really didn't

2816.5 --> 2824.9
deserve it so you got to be careful

2820.1 --> 2827.48
these days though it's easy to forget

2824.9 --> 2829.94
suspicious I guess but thanks for the

2827.48 --> 2834.13
super chata nation and yeah good to see

2829.94 --> 2834.13
you are you doing these days

2850.09 --> 2857.11
yes secret Asian men come yeah but the

2853.72 --> 2863.9199999999996
thing is there must always be a

2857.11 --> 2868.09
container there is no example of not a

2863.92 --> 2870.51
container in the physical world it just

2868.09 --> 2870.51
doesn't exist

2882.2 --> 2888.71
Yan said he said yeah I'm doing all

2884.54 --> 2890.21
right I've yeah it's wintertime a little

2888.71 --> 2893.02
bit more sensitive here and there but

2890.21 --> 2893.02
I'm doing great right now

2895.09 --> 2899.1690000000003
[Music]

2912.16 --> 2918.2999999999997
how would I find and study the container

2915.01 --> 2921.03
well I'd start and said this before

2918.3 --> 2923.9500000000003
beginning of the hangout I'd start by

2921.03 --> 2927.19
figuring out the orientation of the

2923.95 --> 2929.8799999999997
landmasses this is the first thing any

2927.19 --> 2932.05
of us should do and it's doable

2929.88 --> 2934.9900000000002
technically you don't have to go to

2932.05 --> 2942.73
Antarctica or something but no to figure

2934.99 --> 2947.3199999999997
out whether the equator is it that arm

2942.73 --> 2951.0
straight line if it's a perfectly

2947.32 --> 2955.4500000000003
closing circle or if it's a demo circle

2951.0 --> 2958.15
once we establish that orientation we go

2955.45 --> 2960.49
from there on because the consequences

2958.15 --> 2963.1
of any conclusion within this is quite

2960.49 --> 2968.3799999999997
impactful as to what the nature of our

2963.1 --> 2971.65
realm is or could be that's something

2968.38 --> 2974.62
that I understand I wonder if others

2971.65 --> 2976.96
have the same insight but I know that

2974.62 --> 2978.91
that is very important before you go and

2976.96 --> 2980.8
set out and explore anything you got to

2978.91 --> 2984.8199999999997
understand the orientation of the

2980.8 --> 2987.67
landmasses like physically literally in

2984.82 --> 2990.2200000000003
relation to one another now for that you

2987.67 --> 2994.59
need to know the orientation of the

2990.22 --> 2994.5899999999997
equator perfectly

3000.33 --> 3006.24
right well Matlin Carter are claims that

3003.29 --> 3011.1
Rockets have indeed hit the firmament

3006.24 --> 3015.6499999999996
and I am not too sure about that

3011.1 --> 3018.65
look I have ideas on what you could do

3015.65 --> 3018.65
but

3022.16 --> 3028.2
yeah go faster okay I know I've seen it

3024.96 --> 3031.37
all but that is not proof you don't know

3028.2 --> 3031.37
what stop that

3038.67 --> 3045.78
the thing was also you got to realize

3041.4 --> 3048.69
this if you're gonna assume it bumped

3045.78 --> 3052.32
into a container right into a physical

3048.69 --> 3053.66
barrier okay or even if it was flexible

3052.32 --> 3057.96
like it was rubber or something

3053.66 --> 3059.19
perfectly transparent then why at the

3057.96 --> 3062.04
side camera of it

3059.19 --> 3067.08
it was filming exactly even when it was

3062.04 --> 3072.84
stopping why was there no ripple visible

3067.08 --> 3077.8199999999997
as it would hit because if it was

3072.84 --> 3080.31
perfectly inflexible then yeah with that

3077.82 --> 3081.96
speed it would be great likelihood that

3080.31 --> 3084.98
the rocket would have nose would have

3081.96 --> 3087.21
been crushed but since it didn't

3084.98 --> 3092.06
assuming that it did bump into something

3087.21 --> 3097.58
that means that it was cushions then why

3092.06 --> 3101.34
would you not see some kind of ripple as

3097.58 --> 3103.14
the firmament had been pushed in think

3101.34 --> 3107.09
the video was fake yeah well let's see

3103.14 --> 3114.54
see what happens when you really really

3107.09 --> 3117.0
think about it that's what I do it is so

3114.54 --> 3119.31
complicated guys what this is what the

3117.0 --> 3121.17
container is we don't know I've even

3119.31 --> 3122.79
said before and there's other people

3121.17 --> 3125.88
that forwarded this that weren't even

3122.79 --> 3127.86
flat earthers there could be all kinds

3125.88 --> 3130.82
of weird things going on up there like

3127.86 --> 3133.8900000000003
plasma layers other things somehow

3130.82 --> 3139.56
electrically suspended things whatever

3133.89 --> 3142.47
you don't know until you can somehow get

3139.56 --> 3145.92
there in a stable fashion not just with

3142.47 --> 3148.2799999999997
a big projectile but for that you'd have

3145.92 --> 3150.57
to somehow overcome relative density and

3148.28 --> 3154.23
yeah how do you do that is that even

3150.57 --> 3156.54
physically possible is the electrostatic

3154.23 --> 3159.96
propulsion if that would be possible in

3156.54 --> 3163.32
the in the lower parts of the realm near

3159.96 --> 3168.48
the surface does that mean it would also

3163.32 --> 3168.69
be possible at the top wherever that may

3168.48 --> 3172.32
be

3168.69 --> 3174.9
or maybe it's just God's Way

3172.32 --> 3178.1400000000003
of making things so freakin complicated

3174.9 --> 3182.31
that even the highest of high high high

3178.14 --> 3184.98
high mega-mega tech would still have

3182.31 --> 3192.92
issues actually finding the top of it

3184.98 --> 3192.92
just say you don't know

3197.64 --> 3203.49
[Music]

3200.24 --> 3206.8999999999996
yeah yeah thank god there's definitely

3203.49 --> 3210.109
God in the sense that the designer

3206.9 --> 3219.4
creation how things were

3210.109 --> 3222.61
unmanned to unfold I unders ace No

3219.4 --> 3222.61
[Music]

3242.05 --> 3248.2400000000002
Matt lingard the issue is with powered

3244.94 --> 3250.64
flight it only works so far it works on

3248.24 --> 3255.41
the lower regions were very well aware

3250.64 --> 3260.5989999999997
of aerodynamics how the friction can

3255.41 --> 3262.52
actually be bent into lift through

3260.599 --> 3265.25
aerodynamics and all that but the

3262.52 --> 3267.38
problem is is yeah once the density of

3265.25 --> 3270.23
the gases become so low like hydrogen

3267.38 --> 3273.23
and helium then it will have very little

3270.23 --> 3276.14
friction it will be very light making

3273.23 --> 3277.64
the plane relative density much higher

3276.14 --> 3279.92
in relation to its surrounding and it

3277.64 --> 3281.8689999999997
will barely provide any friction for it

3279.92 --> 3284.119
to stick keep lifting so yeah

3281.869 --> 3284.809
aerodynamics don't work all that great

3284.119 --> 3294.349
up there

3284.809 --> 3296.5690000000004
works great down here so the only at

3294.349 --> 3299.0
least temporary way that seems somewhat

3296.569 --> 3302.63
viable of doing that would be a big

3299.0 --> 3305.869
projectile that would literally find a

3302.63 --> 3308.54
lot of momentum to launch itself past

3305.869 --> 3310.9100000000003
the relative density issues but how far

3308.54 --> 3312.74
will it go how far is there before

3310.91 --> 3317.69
there's even any supposed physical

3312.74 --> 3319.339
firmament so it the only way I foresee

3317.69 --> 3321.71
it is to somehow have like an

3319.339 --> 3324.47
electrostatic lift that would literally

3321.71 --> 3328.04
bypass density or that would effectively

3324.47 --> 3330.589
like super depolarizing polarizing

3328.04 --> 3333.5299999999997
whatever making an object effectively

3330.589 --> 3336.2
just as heavy as very light helium even

3333.53 --> 3338.15
though it is steel and whatever I don't

3336.2 --> 3342.5
know what could be done with this that

3338.15 --> 3344.21
may be a way but then again such effects

3342.5 --> 3346.339
do you know what's gonna happen when you

3344.21 --> 3348.619
go way up there or is it good to be

3346.339 --> 3353.0789999999997
counter polarized and suddenly you drop

3348.619 --> 3359.03
out of the sky again there's kind of

3353.079 --> 3359.63
mythological hints to this stuff what

3359.03 --> 3363.5
account

3359.63 --> 3365.9
have you heard mythological wise the IT

3363.5 --> 3372.829
related wise anything related wise where

3365.9 --> 3374.56
anybody besides yeah from long ago from

3372.829 --> 3378.07
myth where they touched

3374.56 --> 3383.0499999999997
the ceiling I don't know about it never

3378.07 --> 3388.17
heard of it there's references of off

3383.05 --> 3388.17
like the God's throne up there or some

3388.68 --> 3399.22
but any witness account alike situation

3396.7 --> 3399.97
where somebody touched the ceiling never

3399.22 --> 3404.8599999999997
heard of that

3399.97 --> 3407.47
although yeah look there's a lot of

3404.86 --> 3411.27
texts out there so maybe there maybe

3407.47 --> 3411.27
there was at some point I don't know

3411.75 --> 3418.02
we have Picard yeah that was interesting

3419.17 --> 3427.429
[Music]

3444.0 --> 3453.849
all right yeah I'm gonna round out the

3448.06 --> 3456.58
show I hope you liked it and despite all

3453.849 --> 3459.76
the drum talk and I hope you will

3456.58 --> 3462.0099999999998
consider some of what I suggested once

3459.76 --> 3466.3900000000003
you get all the agitations out of the

3462.01 --> 3469.69
way the rest is also interesting by the

3466.39 --> 3470.58
way let there a part so thanks everyone

3469.69 --> 3472.81
for coming

3470.58 --> 3475.869
yeah again if you liked the video please

3472.81 --> 3478.06
don't forget to Rogen's up and if you

3475.869 --> 3479.65
haven't already subscribe to my channel

3478.06 --> 3481.24
hit the bell notification so you know

paypal patron my GoFundMe and the super

3488.05 --> 3495.869
chats and thank you for this super chat

3491.2 --> 3498.25
donation earlier from insanity insanity

3495.869 --> 3500.619
I'm going to join the Flat Earth debates

3498.25 --> 3503.53
right after this it's already starting

3500.619 --> 3508.119
and I'll be back tomorrow with Flat

3503.53 --> 3512.2000000000003
Earth early bird number 379 and yeah

3508.119 --> 3514.77
hashtag MIFA until the next video keep

3512.2 --> 3514.77
