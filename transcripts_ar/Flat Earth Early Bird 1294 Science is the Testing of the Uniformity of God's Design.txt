very clear sky

112.24 --> 115.83999999999999
still some clouds hang around

117.2 --> 123.04
but yeah don't not big enough so far to

120.88 --> 125.83999999999999
actually get some rain out of it

123.04 --> 125.84
that's all fine

127.759 --> 134.0
it's turning out to be a great summer

130.479 --> 136.87900000000002
when it was out in town for groceries

134.0 --> 141.2
there was a little parade of farmers

136.879 --> 142.879
coming by on on tractors

141.2 --> 145.11999999999998
oh that was amazing

142.879 --> 147.51999999999998
like five of them just went straight

145.12 --> 147.52
through the

147.92 --> 151.44
through one of the central streets

153.84 --> 157.84
the farmers are on the move

166.879 --> 172.959
hello pjc net first in chat dell wes

169.76 --> 178.76
watson good to see you

172.959 --> 178.76
it is tuesday the 5th of july 2022.

180.319 --> 185.56
and yeah i'm starting a bit late

182.56 --> 185.56
just

187.2 --> 190.72
i want to take it easy a bit

192.239 --> 196.72
i mean my show yesterday was pretty damn

194.8 --> 198.72
intense

196.72 --> 201.28
on the spiritual mechanical level and

198.72 --> 201.28
all that and

203.12 --> 206.799
like i do feel like i can keep holding

205.519 --> 208.87900000000002
out he

206.799 --> 212.0
keep holding up that same level i got to

208.879 --> 214.239
take it easy a while

212.0 --> 216.879
so that i can basically grow back to it

214.239 --> 216.879
do it again

217.2 --> 221.44
but yeah

218.72 --> 224.239
yeah i thought that yesterday as well

221.44 --> 227.2
and then it turned into a like a

224.239 --> 229.92000000000002
a great show again so we'll see what

227.2 --> 229.92
happens today

235.68 --> 242.0
me how

238.159 --> 242.0
yesterday's flat earth debate was great

243.12 --> 246.959
it was

244.48 --> 249.28
decently

246.959 --> 249.28
long

250.239 --> 253.28
for a monday show at least it was very

252.239 --> 255.439
long

253.28 --> 259.88
and

255.439 --> 259.88
yeah what else let's see

281.43 --> 286.16
[Music]

283.68 --> 288.479
flat swords added like he's been back

286.16 --> 290.88000000000005
with his internet and

288.479 --> 293.36
doing short videos and all that

290.88 --> 297.08
interesting some of them

293.36 --> 297.08000000000004
good music definitely

302.88 --> 310.56
yeah that was about it

306.479 --> 312.639
did also finish up watching

310.56 --> 314.0
akira

312.639 --> 315.199
and

314.0 --> 319.52
yeah

315.199 --> 319.52000000000004
well my mandela effect stands

321.36 --> 325.84000000000003
i'm not even making it i'm trying not to

323.759 --> 326.88
make a claim about it's just that it's a

325.84 --> 329.28
finding

326.88 --> 330.479
and it's like i don't know how many

329.28 --> 332.96
people

330.479 --> 337.4
actually do know akira

332.96 --> 337.4
and have watched it like in the 90s

345.28 --> 348.88
right

346.32 --> 351.12
because then yeah i got something to

348.88 --> 354.08
cross records like

351.12 --> 356.32
the combat scream when tatsu hits the

354.08 --> 356.32
guy

356.88 --> 361.28
in like in the at the end of the

359.36 --> 362.8
motorcycle chase scene

361.28 --> 365.039
with the clown yet

362.8 --> 367.6
right and that's pretty much it the rest

365.039 --> 369.44
of it was all just like

367.6 --> 371.91900000000004
music

369.44 --> 375.12
type differences

371.919 --> 378.31899999999996
voice things were all the same

375.12 --> 380.319
it was the same voice palette

378.319 --> 382.56
and the music there was apparently

380.319 --> 385.6
different choices in music and yeah i

382.56 --> 388.0
already have the comparing material

385.6 --> 390.56
right but that screen

388.0 --> 395.16
that combat scream that

390.56 --> 395.16
yeah i can't explain that

397.68 --> 402.56
because like what's even the reason for

399.84 --> 406.84
me to remember that right

402.56 --> 409.28000000000003
it's not like oh oh i really wanted like

406.84 --> 413.35999999999996
everything in the movie made it so

409.28 --> 416.479
important that he had that combat screen

413.36 --> 419.199
no not at all so why do i remember that

416.479 --> 421.84
so distinctly

419.199 --> 424.72
enough to actually try to emulate it

421.84 --> 427.44
when it is not present apparently in the

424.72 --> 429.84000000000003
rest of the entire movie so what's going

427.44 --> 429.84
on here

432.0 --> 435.0
and

438.24 --> 441.36
yeah

439.12 --> 444.0
i can't think of any other material that

441.36 --> 446.08000000000004
i could have mixed it up with

444.0 --> 448.24
i didn't even know any

446.08 --> 450.4
manga like this has pretty much been the

448.24 --> 453.12
only

450.4 --> 456.56
anime movie that i've even seen in the

453.12 --> 459.039
20th century entirely i was not all that

456.56 --> 461.68
interested in it

459.039 --> 464.639
or kind of like

461.68 --> 467.12
i was interested in it but every time

464.639 --> 469.199
when i was a teen and all that i met

467.12 --> 471.12
somebody that was into it there was

469.199 --> 472.0
always something really [ __ ] up about

471.12 --> 473.84000000000003
them

472.0 --> 476.479
and that was to me kind of a warning

473.84 --> 478.479
sign to say away on an intuitive level

476.479 --> 480.15999999999997
like to not get into it too much because

478.479 --> 481.68
everybody that i knew that was getting

480.16 --> 484.40000000000003
into it a lot

481.68 --> 485.919
they were all like messed up

484.4 --> 487.039
in ways

485.919 --> 490.0
so

487.039 --> 493.84
and by the way that is completely

490.0 --> 493.84
without a single exception

496.56 --> 498.72
so

499.36 --> 504.24
yeah

500.479 --> 504.24
besides akira i don't even know

505.52 --> 508.15999999999997
any others

508.639 --> 514.64
like for example that very

511.36 --> 517.599
famous other one

514.64 --> 517.5989999999999
ghost initial

517.68 --> 522.3199999999999
i hadn't seen that one and like didn't

520.479 --> 526.12
even want to see it

522.32 --> 526.12
until like 2005.

528.48 --> 531.519
that's then the first time i saw it even

530.32 --> 534.0
though it's like

531.519 --> 535.12
in the 80s or something or early 90s

534.0 --> 540.0
that it was

535.12 --> 544.399
very popular very very popular

540.0 --> 544.399
right popular enough to re make the

544.48 --> 550.08
the live action version of it and i

548.399 --> 552.0
thought that one wasn't even all that

550.08 --> 553.76
bad i think i saw that one first

552.0 --> 556.88
actually and then just watch the

553.76 --> 556.88
original to compare it

557.6 --> 562.399
the animated one

559.279 --> 565.279
anyhow so yeah that thing stands

562.399 --> 569.68
i'm open for discussion

565.279 --> 572.0
about it for anybody that's like

569.68 --> 574.8
interested or has had similar

572.0 --> 574.8
experiences

574.88 --> 579.36
the movie akira like wait

577.44 --> 581.36
did something change why do i remember

579.36 --> 583.6
this very specific thing why isn't it

581.36 --> 583.6
there

585.76 --> 591.6
besides the music which there seem to be

588.56 --> 592.8
different versions of which are provable

591.6 --> 596.64
anyway

592.8 --> 598.56
i'm up for debate even with brian leakey

596.64 --> 601.519
if he wants to

598.56 --> 602.64
oh was it is it bryan lee the mandela

601.519 --> 604.8
guy

602.64 --> 606.64
he knows everything about it well i got

604.8 --> 608.0
another one for you

606.64 --> 610.0
brian

608.0 --> 612.64
i know we're probably not on the best of

610.0 --> 612.64
terms but

612.959 --> 618.2399999999999
i have a very specific angle of approach

615.76 --> 621.279
to the mandela effect psychological but

618.24 --> 623.2
this one is just

621.279 --> 625.519
it seems so obscure

623.2 --> 627.839
and i don't know anything really i don't

625.519 --> 630.16
know where to dig even with this

627.839 --> 633.839
stately sorry not brian leakey brian

630.16 --> 633.8389999999999
stapley thank you godzilla

635.04 --> 641.04
me and names is terrible sometimes

637.68 --> 641.04
it was brian's day but yeah

642.959 --> 648.0
it seemed like i am a bigger mother yeah

645.04 --> 649.68
but it's most i'm still

648.0 --> 651.92
very

649.68 --> 655.1999999999999
certain that it is psychological i'm

651.92 --> 656.7199999999999
just not really understanding with how

655.2 --> 659.12
in this case

656.72 --> 660.399
how my mind constructed it like this

659.12 --> 662.8
then

660.399 --> 664.959
where did i get it from

662.8 --> 667.519
how could i have an element that's not

664.959 --> 669.8389999999999
an it's not even like an all it was

667.519 --> 671.279
something that stood out

669.839 --> 674.519
and now

671.279 --> 674.519
it's unremarkable

675.04 --> 679.519
right that's not the typical

676.8 --> 682.8
psychological psychologically easy to

679.519 --> 682.8
explain mandela effect

683.519 --> 688.9590000000001
it's not a mix-up it's not like oh

685.279 --> 691.279
through the story oh i thought he was

688.959 --> 694.56
then he would have to mean this no it

691.279 --> 698.56
was just a scream it makes no there is

694.56 --> 702.4399999999999
no logic really to rearrange it it just

698.56 --> 702.4399999999999
doesn't make any sense

703.68 --> 706.959
why do i remember that

715.76 --> 721.12
like why do i remember it enough to

717.92 --> 723.279
actually mimic it

721.12 --> 725.839
when it isn't present in this movie how

723.279 --> 725.8389999999999
can that be

728.639 --> 733.12
well i have an alternative theory in

730.959 --> 734.6389999999999
that sense even

733.12 --> 738.079
though asg by the way and stubborn

734.639 --> 738.0790000000001
trafficking arrest i had clutch

742.16 --> 746.88
and i'm starting to listen also to music

744.399 --> 750.32
and that is that

746.88 --> 753.36
the way music actually works especially

750.32 --> 755.44
like more electronic type musics but all

753.36 --> 757.36
music in ways is that there's so much

755.44 --> 760.1600000000001
happening at the same time

757.36 --> 762.16
that there's like different paths

760.16 --> 763.68
that your consciousness can take within

762.16 --> 765.6
the music

763.68 --> 767.68
that will result in different effects

765.6 --> 772.16
and this is how when you like listen to

767.68 --> 775.8389999999999
the same music like much later

772.16 --> 779.279
that often you hear it you have memories

775.839 --> 781.0400000000001
that associate but then it's different

779.279 --> 782.0
there's something different about it

781.04 --> 784.8
because

782.0 --> 787.279
you're certainly hearing another path

784.8 --> 789.519
that for some reason you couldn't focus

787.279 --> 792.32
on you as you were younger right

789.519 --> 792.32
that sort of thing

794.32 --> 798.0
so it's like the sensories that you have

796.56 --> 802.88
available

798.0 --> 802.88
change the way the information arrives

802.959 --> 806.959
yeah that

804.24 --> 808.8
that would be my deeper

806.959 --> 811.04
mandela

808.8 --> 813.519
effect suspicion

811.04 --> 815.68
if i would have to lay this down it's

813.519 --> 818.16
it's still not a full explanation on

815.68 --> 821.8389999999999
this on my specific example

818.16 --> 821.8389999999999
with the combat screen but still

823.92 --> 830.56
maybe there is like a different track

828.0 --> 834.88
to certain things and then when you're

830.56 --> 836.8
younger you just have that younger track

834.88 --> 841.32
and then when you grow older it

836.8 --> 841.3199999999999
literally all becomes different

843.519 --> 848.88
it's just it it's not the same thing

846.32 --> 850.9590000000001
your conscience will not be able to walk

848.88 --> 852.32
the same path because your centuries

850.959 --> 856.5189999999999
have changed

852.32 --> 856.519
and so it just is different

861.09 --> 865.6
[Music]

863.519 --> 867.839
uh no don't don't

865.6 --> 870.839
pull it that far

867.839 --> 870.839
do

870.88 --> 873.36
do

872.32 --> 876.0
don't

873.36 --> 879.12
don't drown in the mandela effect like

876.0 --> 882.399
this it is did me bringing this up is

879.12 --> 885.279
not like oh that means it's all right

882.399 --> 889.04
it's all been still affecting the entire

885.279 --> 891.199
universe is just poop it's all different

889.04 --> 895.199
no

891.199 --> 897.3599999999999
that's not what it is it is and will be

895.199 --> 898.8
psychological

897.36 --> 902.0790000000001
always

898.8 --> 904.4799999999999
i'm just trying to figure out how

902.079 --> 908.16
how is it

904.48 --> 911.1990000000001
reality is not rearranging around you

908.16 --> 913.8389999999999
like a resetting matrix

911.199 --> 913.8389999999999
it isn't

914.0 --> 918.0
it just

915.519 --> 918.0
isn't

922.69 --> 926.48
[Music]

924.639 --> 930.5600000000001
it is us

926.48 --> 933.72
that is resetting and rearranging around

930.56 --> 933.7199999999999
the reality

950.88 --> 956.16
letting anybody convince me to have

953.6 --> 957.9200000000001
anything a memory problem

956.16 --> 961.279
[ __ ] them

957.92 --> 963.759
dude i have entire dark world visions

961.279 --> 965.759
that did not take place in the physical

963.759 --> 968.32
world that have analyzed you think that

965.759 --> 972.9590000000001
i'd let anybody

968.32 --> 974.639
do anything to my dreams or my memories

972.959 --> 976.25
no

974.639 --> 979.299
no no no no

976.25 --> 979.299
[Music]

979.36 --> 985.279
i am not

982.56 --> 986.6389999999999
i'd like i don't prioritize even to

985.279 --> 988.24
adapt

986.639 --> 991.36
like that

988.24 --> 995.04
oh something is wrong i must alter it to

991.36 --> 997.36
synchronize with every [ __ ] that

995.04 --> 1000.3199999999999
oh oh i have an aberration something

997.36 --> 1003.36
that's like because of an error well i'm

1000.32 --> 1006.0
still gonna just have it and then i'll

1003.36 --> 1008.24
learn how it is just an error and then

1006.0 --> 1010.72
it's my error and it's something that i

1008.24 --> 1012.399
can reflect on and show everybody in the

1010.72 --> 1014.399
world like this is happening look at

1012.399 --> 1016.639
what's happening with this

1014.399 --> 1018.959
i'm not gonna hide anything i'm not

1016.639 --> 1022.399
gonna allow

1018.959 --> 1025.36
consensus to alter

1022.399 --> 1027.76
my memory

1025.36 --> 1030.4799999999998
i remember what i remember and if it is

1027.76 --> 1033.36
wrong then i shall figure out how and

1030.48 --> 1036.88
why it is wrong

1033.36 --> 1039.4389999999999
just like the scientific method

1036.88 --> 1044.4
always prove something it proves either

1039.439 --> 1046.48
it is that the hypothesis is correct

1044.4 --> 1048.64
that the

1046.48 --> 1051.28
the phenomenon causes the effect or that

1048.64 --> 1052.72
it doesn't

1051.28 --> 1054.0
i will still

1052.72 --> 1057.2
have

1054.0 --> 1059.6
it i will not erase it i will not forget

1057.2 --> 1061.44
about it i will not think oh it's just a

1059.6 --> 1063.84
delusion i just i'm not going to

1061.44 --> 1065.6000000000001
remember this is embarrassing no if it

1063.84 --> 1069.1999999999998
is an error if it is a

1065.6 --> 1071.36
a null situation then i will still keep

1069.2 --> 1071.3600000000001
it

1073.28 --> 1080.2
because even if there's a null result

1075.52 --> 1080.2
then still something is there

1082.16 --> 1085.16
um

1092.58 --> 1095.81
[Music]

1096.799 --> 1101.679
that's right elise g

1098.96 --> 1103.44
you know why because of peer pressure or

1101.679 --> 1105.039
well not even pressure it's just because

1103.44 --> 1107.52
of the peers

1105.039 --> 1110.71
it's like memory synchronization

1107.52 --> 1112.0
it's like agreeance and the memory

1110.71 --> 1113.52
[Music]

1112.0 --> 1116.559
can adapt

1113.52 --> 1116.559
to that agreeance

1117.28 --> 1122.1299999999999
that's right always g very perceptive of

1119.6 --> 1128.9189999999999
you

1122.13 --> 1128.919
[Music]

1147.679 --> 1153.919
okay that's fine rest dad

1151.76 --> 1156.08
i'm not telling you to forget any of it

1153.919 --> 1159.76
i'm just telling you

1156.08 --> 1162.6399999999999
the mandela effect is psychological it

1159.76 --> 1165.12
is not the entire world rearranging

1162.64 --> 1167.76
itself physically around you

1165.12 --> 1169.52
like a matrix reset that's not what it

1167.76 --> 1172.24
is

1169.52 --> 1175.24
and i'm not gonna move away from that

1172.24 --> 1175.24
position

1204.72 --> 1208.72
yeah sorry about the way arina kowamba i

1207.2 --> 1211.3600000000001
can't help it

1208.72 --> 1215.2
it is a thing i will be discussed

1211.36 --> 1217.9189999999999
when i want to discuss this specific one

1215.2 --> 1220.159
i don't want to now be oh my dell effect

1217.919 --> 1221.8400000000001
oh that means that old mandela affect

1220.159 --> 1224.159
people that are obsessed with this [ __ ]

1221.84 --> 1226.72
now suddenly have some legitimacy with

1224.159 --> 1230.2
their obsession no

1226.72 --> 1230.2
no you don't

1236.76 --> 1241.36
[Music]

1239.2 --> 1243.6000000000001
yeah well with the bible rest ahead it

1241.36 --> 1245.76
might be different i as i explained on

1243.6 --> 1249.52
my show yesterday

1245.76 --> 1253.28
very elaborately i had a very extensive

1249.52 --> 1254.32
detailed dark world vision experience

1253.28 --> 1256.1589999999999
with

1254.32 --> 1258.24
the freaking bible

1256.159 --> 1262.0
being altered

1258.24 --> 1264.799
and it was like literally right there it

1262.0 --> 1265.76
was like happening

1264.799 --> 1268.48
it was

1265.76 --> 1271.44
like decided

1268.48 --> 1273.6
and it was my first association even

1271.44 --> 1278.3200000000002
with some kind of mystery around a

1273.6 --> 1278.32
mandela effect but it was right there

1283.12 --> 1287.6789999999999
so

1285.2 --> 1288.48
i don't know how i don't know what that

1287.679 --> 1290.3200000000002
is

1288.48 --> 1291.919
there is something really weird with the

1290.32 --> 1295.039
bible

1291.919 --> 1297.76
in ways but in many ways it's not even

1295.039 --> 1299.84
just completely excluding this supposed

1297.76 --> 1300.64
mandela effect that it's being subjected

1299.84 --> 1303.039
to

1300.64 --> 1305.2
which is really freaky other than that

1303.039 --> 1307.36
the entire thing is like highly

1305.2 --> 1310.72
contrived now

1307.36 --> 1310.7199999999998
to me it is like a

1310.96 --> 1317.3600000000001
a political power book made by devils

1315.52 --> 1319.52
to encapsulate

1317.36 --> 1321.76
christ

1319.52 --> 1322.8799999999999
which like a pure flame still remains

1321.76 --> 1325.84
within it

1322.88 --> 1325.8400000000001
but like hidden

1326.4 --> 1332.4
it's hidden in plain sight in the book

1329.52 --> 1333.36
but the rest of it is all very

1332.4 --> 1336.3200000000002
weird

1333.36 --> 1338.559
and contrived and i yeah

1336.32 --> 1338.559
is

1338.88 --> 1343.919
like potentially priestly and magical

1341.919 --> 1348.24
with freaky [ __ ]

1343.919 --> 1350.7990000000002
how that was established it is not made

1348.24 --> 1353.44
by people that are good in my opinion

1350.799 --> 1356.799
the bible

1353.44 --> 1356.799
it was more about power

1357.12 --> 1361.6789999999999
except for jesus christ

1359.679 --> 1363.1200000000001
which i think are literal

1361.679 --> 1365.52
quotes

1363.12 --> 1369.1999999999998
from an original real person that did

1365.52 --> 1372.24
say those things in their in those ways

1369.2 --> 1375.52
but the rest of the book is just

1372.24 --> 1378.48
it is not what it seems to be

1375.52 --> 1381.37
it's not what it proclaims to be

1378.48 --> 1382.72
and it's almost like

1381.37 --> 1385.84
[Music]

1382.72 --> 1387.84
supposed to be like that

1385.84 --> 1390.9599999999998
like in the face of christ it's like the

1387.84 --> 1394.24
rest of the book is like the test in the

1390.96 --> 1398.0
face of christ literally literally right

1394.24 --> 1400.64
there in the book the rest is the test

1398.0 --> 1405.4
jesus christ is the best

1400.64 --> 1405.4
and the rest is the test

1427.12 --> 1432.2399999999998
you know where your angers are well yeah

1429.36 --> 1434.8799999999999
rust hat i'm very confident that all my

1432.24 --> 1437.679
organs are in exactly the same place

1434.88 --> 1440.0
as they've always been

1437.679 --> 1443.5590000000002
you on the other hand

1440.0 --> 1446.96
have been taking a whole bunch of pretty

1443.559 --> 1446.96
experimental things

1447.039 --> 1451.12
oh for quite a long time

1450.159 --> 1452.5590000000002
i

1451.12 --> 1455.279
it is not

1452.559 --> 1459.0
widely understood necessarily what that

1455.279 --> 1459.0
all does to you

1462.24 --> 1467.2
i mean most of this

1464.96 --> 1470.24
these substances that are available are

1467.2 --> 1470.24
not even like

1470.88 --> 1476.44
not even over a hundred years old

1473.44 --> 1476.44
entirely

1489.44 --> 1494.88
my kidneys are in like

1493.36 --> 1497.6
right beside

1494.88 --> 1499.679
my spine

1497.6 --> 1502.559
in the

1499.679 --> 1504.72
is it 10 centimeters apart above where

1502.559 --> 1507.44
my hips start

1504.72 --> 1509.679
dude i don't have to point i can feel

1507.44 --> 1514.44

yeah

1521.039 --> 1527.52
and my heart is right here

1524.559 --> 1529.52
i can literally feel it

1527.52 --> 1531.44
like my sensories

1529.52 --> 1534.08
are like think of

1531.44 --> 1536.88
tactile sensories from fingertips with

1534.08 --> 1539.9189999999999
people that are like doing detail work

1536.88 --> 1544.159
right they have super i have that level

1539.919 --> 1546.96
of sensory throughout my entire body

1544.159 --> 1549.6000000000001
my entire body yeah and that includes

1546.96 --> 1552.24
pain situations so that sucks about it i

1549.6 --> 1554.6399999999999
can feel where it is

1552.24 --> 1557.279
i can literally just take i can feel i

1554.64 --> 1561.039
can i rearrange pain i can do all kinds

1557.279 --> 1561.039
of i know where it is

1561.12 --> 1566.08
you're so far off you look like no

1566.159 --> 1571.0390000000002
i can feel where it is i can feel when

1569.279 --> 1573.76
things happen to it

1571.039 --> 1578.24
when i eat extra salt

1573.76 --> 1578.24
i can feel my kidneys

1578.799 --> 1582.799
yeah i do know where they are

1581.039 --> 1585.84
they're right here

1582.799 --> 1585.84
right there

1590.72 --> 1595.2
i don't care what some kind of weirdo

1592.96 --> 1597.679
online [ __ ] is saying

1595.2 --> 1599.44
or even whatever books are saying about

1597.679 --> 1601.919
that forever

1599.44 --> 1604.0
i don't care

1601.919 --> 1607.1200000000001
look maybe the medical system just

1604.0 --> 1608.08
mandela affected did some dark magic

1607.12 --> 1610.6399999999999
[ __ ]

1608.08 --> 1613.1999999999998
of their entire

1610.64 --> 1615.3600000000001
material

1613.2 --> 1618.96
i wouldn't be surprised because it seems

1615.36 --> 1622.0
like the entire medical system is much

1618.96 --> 1624.4
much darker than i had originally even

1622.0 --> 1625.44
imagined it could be

1624.4 --> 1627.44
so

1625.44 --> 1628.559
maybe they're playing devil tricks i

1627.44 --> 1630.799
just know

1628.559 --> 1633.6789999999999
wherever it's supposed to be according

1630.799 --> 1634.799
to them i can feel where it is right

1756.88 --> 1761.8400000000001
in order for me to be extra aware of

1759.679 --> 1763.039

be somewhere else man

1872.32 --> 1877.36
no i'm not gonna look it up i can feel

1875.12 --> 1880.799
where it is

1877.36 --> 1881.9189999999999
yeah it is on the left side of my body

1880.799 --> 1884.8799999999999
it is

1881.919 --> 1887.1200000000001
it's right there i can feel it pumping

1884.88 --> 1889.1200000000001
go [ __ ] yourself

1887.12 --> 1890.8799999999999
i don't care if it's supposed to be

1889.12 --> 1893.84
somewhere else now

1890.88 --> 1897.0390000000002
with me it isn't it's right there i can

1893.84 --> 1899.84
feel it right now

1897.039 --> 1901.919
as my blood is pumping and rising

1899.84 --> 1904.24
because i'm getting pissed off i can

1901.919 --> 1907.6000000000001
feel it even more

1904.24 --> 1910.88
i can feel even more that it is exactly

1907.6 --> 1913.519
right there and how it is pressing right

1910.88 --> 1916.48
there and there i can feel it right now

1913.519 --> 1918.96
don't [ __ ] tell me where my [ __ ]

1916.48 --> 1921.519

[Music]

1931.44 --> 1936.64
you're [ __ ] mental dude the other day

1934.64 --> 1939.279
you almost had a freaking mental

1936.64 --> 1941.6000000000001
breakdown online okay

1939.279 --> 1943.519
i'm not gonna share the details

1941.6 --> 1945.9189999999999
you're already half

1943.519 --> 1948.08
in nutcase land and you're gonna push

1945.919 --> 1950.24
this [ __ ] through

1948.08 --> 1953.1999999999998
you're going insane buddy

1950.24 --> 1955.519
you're going way off track

1953.2 --> 1957.039
and i'm not gonna entertain you

1955.519 --> 1959.44
especially if you're gonna have that

1957.039 --> 1962.32
kind of attitude towards me you hear me

1959.44 --> 1965.2
rasta hat

1962.32 --> 1968.08
the guy with no show

1965.2 --> 1970.799
that's not doing this every day

1968.08 --> 1974.08
for four years and more and developing

1970.799 --> 1974.08
entire cosmologies

1974.84 --> 1978.0
yeah go

1977.279 --> 1981.12
to

1978.0 --> 1984.64
this brian stavely guy and just stay

1981.12 --> 1987.4399999999998
there then go and go nuts go nuts with

1984.64 --> 1989.44
it see where that leads you

1987.44 --> 1991.519
as far as i'm concerned it's not really

1989.44 --> 1994.64
making you happy so you might want to

1991.519 --> 1994.64
reconsider esther

1995.039 --> 1999.44
done with this [ __ ]

1997.039 --> 2001.679
i'll unblock you when you stop prove to

2029.12 --> 2032.9189999999999
so yeah that's that

2034.159 --> 2039.519
i'm still curious if somebody still has

2037.039 --> 2042.24
half a [ __ ] brain left without going

2039.519 --> 2044.48
in mental over everything

2042.24 --> 2049.119
if they could actually address

2044.48 --> 2050.639
my personal mandela observation

2049.119 --> 2053.52
with

2050.639 --> 2056.079
the akira movie concerning tatsuo's

2053.52 --> 2061.0
battle scream at the end

2056.079 --> 2061.0
of the motorcycle chasing scene

2061.919 --> 2069.2799999999997
i just that just that little detail only

2067.119 --> 2070.7200000000003
that [ __ ] little detail i want some

2069.28 --> 2074.079
feedback

2070.72 --> 2076.6389999999997
because i don't get it

2074.079 --> 2076.639
that's it

2077.2 --> 2079.6789999999996
that's it

2080.159 --> 2084.639
i don't want the entire barrage i don't

2082.8 --> 2086.639
want any scattergunning about how

2084.639 --> 2088.079
everything's supposedly changed and

2086.639 --> 2089.9190000000003
nothing where it's supposed to be and

2088.079 --> 2092.0
then you go squirting out everything's

2089.919 --> 2093.44
gone insane i i don't give a [ __ ] for

2092.0 --> 2095.44
that

2093.44 --> 2099.28
go back to the looney bin

2095.44 --> 2100.2400000000002
i just want some basic basic inquiry

2099.28 --> 2103.6400000000003
here

2100.24 --> 2103.64
that's all

2107.18 --> 2110.3799999999997
[Music]

2116.72 --> 2120.2
halo clutch

2132.0 --> 2135.68
what the [ __ ]

2134.0 --> 2140.24
hello joe john

2135.68 --> 2143.2
no those two have absolutely no relation

2140.24 --> 2145.52
we are not in a simulation

2143.2 --> 2147.839
yes the substance of this realm is

2145.52 --> 2150.72
simulatory

2147.839 --> 2153.92
but it is not a simulation because a

2150.72 --> 2156.7999999999997
simulation would then immediately

2153.92 --> 2160.079
invoke naturally

2156.8 --> 2163.76
that there would be an over realm which

2160.079 --> 2165.76
would be the real material realm

2163.76 --> 2168.0
because if it's a simulation that means

2165.76 --> 2169.92
there's another material realm of which

2168.0 --> 2173.04
this is a simulation

2169.92 --> 2178.2400000000002
there isn't

2173.04 --> 2178.24
this is the only material dimension

2180.16 --> 2182.0
right

2181.119 --> 2184.32
and

2182.0 --> 2186.64
yeah mandela effect

2184.32 --> 2188.88
well most of it is psychological so it's

2186.64 --> 2192.0789999999997
part of the challenge of humanity you

2188.88 --> 2193.119
could say invoke

2192.079 --> 2195.28
uh

2193.119 --> 2198.2400000000002
morpheus

2195.28 --> 2200.4
the demonic dream alteration even that

2198.24 --> 2203.2799999999997
it might be a part of that maybe

2200.4 --> 2205.76
yeah one of the old demons

2203.28 --> 2208.88
is left over from the pantheon age and

2205.76 --> 2210.079
they [ __ ] with people's minds

2208.88 --> 2212.079
and the more

2210.079 --> 2214.4
enriched with information they become

2212.079 --> 2215.92
the more they get screwed with that only

2214.4 --> 2219.28
makes sense

2215.92 --> 2221.52
from a mythological perspective

2219.28 --> 2221.52
right

2223.2 --> 2228.48
but yeah

2224.72 --> 2230.7999999999997
god the designer outside of the material

2228.48 --> 2233.119
realm having designed it all

2230.8 --> 2235.44
does not exclude

2233.119 --> 2240.28
people within the material realm having

2235.44 --> 2240.28
mandela effect like experiences

2254.64 --> 2260.24
we can even begin to know it exists it

2256.72 --> 2262.48
doesn't jo john this is the material

2260.24 --> 2262.4799999999996
realm

2264.079 --> 2271.52
this is the one where it's time bout

2266.4 --> 2273.76
there is like a sub in between place

2271.52 --> 2273.7599999999998
right

2273.92 --> 2278.56
is that the dark world

2276.48 --> 2281.04
maybe it's

2278.56 --> 2284.48
i'm not sure

2281.04 --> 2288.96
but this is the original foundation like

2284.48 --> 2290.2400000000002
this is the spring of matter itself this

2288.96 --> 2292.56
realm

2290.24 --> 2294.72
this is where the matter is

2292.56 --> 2297.04
everywhere in between

2294.72 --> 2299.4399999999996
is basically lent

2297.04 --> 2301.599
from this just like in the dark world

2299.44 --> 2303.839
where it's only spirit

2301.599 --> 2305.52
all the reflections all the visions all

2303.839 --> 2308.0
the things that you create in the

2305.52 --> 2310.4
holodeck with your spirit

2308.0 --> 2313.359
are all reflections

2310.4 --> 2316.4
of the material realm of your

2313.359 --> 2317.2
experiences there without it there would

2316.4 --> 2320.1600000000003
be

2317.2 --> 2320.16
no content

2321.44 --> 2327.92
the material realm is the foundation it

2324.64 --> 2330.16
is the real thing it is not a simulation

2327.92 --> 2333.28
of another thing

2330.16 --> 2336.2799999999997
it is however in the way it is designed

2333.28 --> 2336.28
simulatory

2339.119 --> 2344.7200000000003
as god outside of it

2341.92 --> 2347.599
is created has designed it as a

2344.72 --> 2350.7999999999997
simulation since he is outside so he has

2347.599 --> 2353.3590000000004
been like a computer game programmer

2350.8 --> 2355.8390000000004
to the computer game we are the computer

2353.359 --> 2355.839
game

2356.56 --> 2360.16
but

2357.44 --> 2363.119
that computer game realm is the real

2360.16 --> 2366.7999999999997
material realm where outside of it where

2363.119 --> 2369.92
god it resides in that level

2366.8 --> 2372.4
there is no material realm it doesn't

2369.92 --> 2372.4
exist

2372.48 --> 2378.64
not in this sense anyway

2375.76 --> 2381.28
the potential maybe but it doesn't

2378.64 --> 2382.8799999999997
actually exist and is not subjected by

2381.28 --> 2385.28
time and all that

2382.88 --> 2385.28
out there

2392.72 --> 2398.3999999999996
so if reality is really real

2395.2 --> 2402.0
in every way it can be for us as humans

2398.4 --> 2404.96
then how does mandela affect stuff again

2402.0 --> 2407.44
how does mandela affect stuff can happen

2404.96 --> 2409.52
okay that's

2407.44 --> 2413.52
poor spelling there but how can that

2409.52 --> 2416.16
happen very simple it's psychological

2413.52 --> 2421.119
morpheus comes by

2416.16 --> 2421.1189999999997
and alters our memories he [ __ ] with us

2423.68 --> 2426.96
right

2424.48 --> 2429.599
so that we become convinced that it's

2426.96 --> 2431.44
supposed to be different but we simply

2429.599 --> 2432.4
misremembered

2431.44 --> 2435.28
but

2432.4 --> 2436.48
that's the superficial mandela effect

2435.28 --> 2438.7200000000003
versions

2436.48 --> 2440.72
there are other

2438.72 --> 2444.3999999999996
weirder traits

2440.72 --> 2445.68
probably also from the same morpheus

2444.4 --> 2448.88
the demon

2445.68 --> 2448.8799999999997
from the greek mythology

2449.04 --> 2453.44
the

2450.839 --> 2455.04
giant that sends out

2453.44 --> 2456.56
delusions

2455.04 --> 2458.88
among people

2456.56 --> 2461.52
that's what he did that's why unnerved

2458.88 --> 2461.52
me so much

2461.76 --> 2465.28
there may be something deeper to it

2464.4 --> 2468.319
right

2465.28 --> 2470.1600000000003
the psychological weirdness

2468.319 --> 2473.44
that we're being subjected to that is

2470.16 --> 2476.96
causing our mandela effect experiences

2473.44 --> 2479.76
might not be just only one switch

2476.96 --> 2482.319
mechanism it might be a whole array

2479.76 --> 2484.7200000000003
of complex things including

2482.319 --> 2486.64
what i suspected earlier and explain try

2484.72 --> 2488.3999999999996
to explain where rasta started squirting

2486.64 --> 2491.2
all over my chat

2488.4 --> 2491.2000000000003
about how

2491.52 --> 2498.24
the level of your sensories that you

2494.72 --> 2499.2
have available may actually completely

2498.24 --> 2502.16
change

2499.2 --> 2503.52
in unexpected ways that are just that

2502.16 --> 2505.44
defy

2503.52 --> 2508.079
understanding

2505.44 --> 2511.28
the our perception of reality

2508.079 --> 2512.8
so it not just the secondary mechanism

2511.28 --> 2517.2000000000003
in our mind that tries to make it

2512.8 --> 2520.88
aesthetic not just that but beyond that

2517.2 --> 2522.7999999999997
that the way sensory input even comes to

2520.88 --> 2526.88
you from the outside

2522.8 --> 2528.4
might completely change

2526.88 --> 2530.1600000000003
over time

2528.4 --> 2532.319
because when you're young

2530.16 --> 2534.7999999999997
you're driven by a certain array of

2532.319 --> 2536.8
impulses that really color the way you

2534.8 --> 2539.2000000000003
see things right just like emotions

2536.8 --> 2542.1600000000003
color your perception how you look at

2539.2 --> 2544.319
things well in your youth your

2542.16 --> 2547.68
you got much more pushiness from

2544.319 --> 2550.96
internal energy yet very little grip

2547.68 --> 2552.3999999999996
it's likely even in my opinion that that

2550.96 --> 2556.0
literally

2552.4 --> 2558.8
like a like a magical effect rearranges

2556.0 --> 2560.4
how you perceive things in potentially

2558.8 --> 2562.0
surreal ways

2560.4 --> 2564.64
so by that

2562.0 --> 2567.839
train of thinking that potential

2564.64 --> 2570.319
explanation is not really complete yet

2567.839 --> 2573.04
by that train of thinking i could have

2570.319 --> 2575.92
literally heard the combat cry as i was

2573.04 --> 2578.319
like really into it really in a

2575.92 --> 2581.2000000000003
sickening way in like a rage against the

2578.319 --> 2583.7599999999998
world way which is exactly what tatsuo

2581.2 --> 2585.68
is experiencing that movie i synchronize

2583.76 --> 2587.6800000000003
a lot with that guy and it scares me

2585.68 --> 2589.1189999999997
because he completely goes out of

2587.68 --> 2592.96
control

2589.119 --> 2595.28
but i am very much sympathetic

2592.96 --> 2597.2
because he's just like [ __ ] leave me

2595.28 --> 2600.8
alone and

2597.2 --> 2600.7999999999997
no sense of responsibility

2600.96 --> 2605.04
and because i might have been so

2602.88 --> 2608.4
synchronized and close i might have been

2605.04 --> 2609.599
privy to this unique

2608.4 --> 2612.079
combat

2609.599 --> 2615.3590000000004
scream that i heard but i might have

2612.079 --> 2617.76
literally not literally heard it

2615.359 --> 2620.7999999999997
as in not auditory

2617.76 --> 2621.76
it might have been my mind rearranging

2620.8 --> 2626.0
it

2621.76 --> 2628.4
like re-weaving it almost inserting that

2626.0 --> 2631.92
consistently

2628.4 --> 2634.96
for myself like a micro delusion

2631.92 --> 2637.28
i mean this isn't potential option to me

2634.96 --> 2640.4
that's why i want to hear did you hear

2637.28 --> 2640.4
it did you hear the comments

2643.359 --> 2648.0
right did you hear that did you hear

2645.839 --> 2650.88
that in akira

2648.0 --> 2652.48
i want to know is it just me is it is it

2650.88 --> 2655.76
me that

2652.48 --> 2659.44
created that out of nothing

2655.76 --> 2659.44
because i was so into it

2659.68 --> 2664.72
or

2661.839 --> 2666.56
is it more universal

2664.72 --> 2671.2799999999997
but i do think that

2666.56 --> 2672.16
you you as a very young person literally

2671.28 --> 2675.44
look

2672.16 --> 2678.0789999999997
differently at materials at movies at

2675.44 --> 2680.48
books at stories you got told

2678.079 --> 2682.2400000000002
because of the way your mind and heart

2680.48 --> 2683.52
work back then the energies that go

2682.24 --> 2686.24
through

2683.52 --> 2688.96
it's very likely you completely perceive

2686.24 --> 2691.1189999999997
things differently

2688.96 --> 2695.119
with because of just the other types of

2691.119 --> 2697.28
trainer thinking you're stuck in

2695.119 --> 2697.28
so

2710.72 --> 2715.9199999999996
the delicate nature of our memories is

2712.72 --> 2719.839
what throws doubt all the legitimacy

2715.92 --> 2719.839
what does that have to do with it

2727.76 --> 2732.119
hello by the way slow mo moon buggy

2755.839 --> 2758.839
hilarious

2777.28 --> 2782.079
it doesn't take many years for

2778.8 --> 2782.96
collective misremembering

2782.079 --> 2786.079
yeah

2782.96 --> 2787.599
of sure mayak but that's not how the

2786.079 --> 2789.28
bible

2787.599 --> 2792.319
most of it at least

2789.28 --> 2795.52
that's not how it was created though

2792.319 --> 2795.52
maybe the old testament

2797.28 --> 2800.5600000000004
right

2798.64 --> 2802.8799999999997
but you got to realize that when

2800.56 --> 2805.44
information is passed on through verbal

2802.88 --> 2805.44
tradition

2805.839 --> 2809.44
you have to

2807.839 --> 2811.599
make it bardic

2809.44 --> 2813.839
you have to or it's not going to be

2811.599 --> 2816.6400000000003
remembered so the story has to be

2813.839 --> 2819.2
adapted to a way

2816.64 --> 2821.7599999999998
that plays into all the needs throughout

2819.2 --> 2824.72
the time all the natural needs that a

2821.76 --> 2826.2400000000002
person of that culture is going to have

2824.72 --> 2828.0
so

2826.24 --> 2830.9599999999996
by that standard

2828.0 --> 2832.72
what the story is the greek mythology

2830.96 --> 2834.319
the old testament

2832.72 --> 2837.5989999999997
is intrical

2834.319 --> 2840.64
intrical to the people that they were in

2837.599 --> 2844.839
order to remember it like that

2840.64 --> 2844.839
you could almost say

2846.0 --> 2849.68
they're entirely a singular mandela

2848.319 --> 2850.96
effect

2849.68 --> 2853.52
because it's all

2850.96 --> 2856.4
specifically told in a way that you

2853.52 --> 2859.52
would oh that it it's always playing

2856.4 --> 2861.92
into the aesthetic thing it's always

2859.52 --> 2863.7599999999998
being the best version in accordance to

2861.92 --> 2864.48
the mind it's going to be confronted

2863.76 --> 2866.8
with

2864.48 --> 2868.079
as tested over

2866.8 --> 2870.4
centuries

2868.079 --> 2872.4
of verbal tradition and seeing the

2870.4 --> 2874.4
responses from people like

2872.4 --> 2876.319
you tell a story what are the questions

2874.4 --> 2878.0
they are going to ask which are the

2876.319 --> 2880.24
characters they are going to focus on

2878.0 --> 2881.28
focus on and be inspired by

2880.24 --> 2883.2799999999997
how

2881.28 --> 2885.76
and then you keep testing it and testing

2883.28 --> 2888.1600000000003
it again in another generation see how

2885.76 --> 2890.88
they respond in another generation and

2888.16 --> 2893.1189999999997
then after like four generations in year

2890.88 --> 2895.2000000000003
olds you know something about your

2893.119 --> 2898.1600000000003
people and then you're gonna pass that

2895.2 --> 2900.72
on that knowledge as directly as you can

2898.16 --> 2903.04
to your students to the ones that are

2900.72 --> 2905.2
also want to be a storyteller board and

2903.04 --> 2907.92
you try to help them understand and then

2905.2 --> 2910.7999999999997
they with their young inspired energy

2907.92 --> 2913.76
use the wisdom of the old to even chisel

2910.8 --> 2917.119
and perfect the story even further

2913.76 --> 2919.5200000000004
to breathe youth in it while the old has

2917.119 --> 2921.44
carefully chiseled it

2919.52 --> 2924.4
then the young breeds new life and

2921.44 --> 2927.2000000000003
that's verbal tradition that's how

2924.4 --> 2929.28
the greek mythology

2927.2 --> 2931.52
and the old testament

2929.28 --> 2934.8
have been formed

2931.52 --> 2938.88
you have to understand the the detailed

2934.8 --> 2940.4
process that is in it so much work

2938.88 --> 2942.8
dude

2940.4 --> 2944.559
a verbal tradition needs to be spoken

2942.8 --> 2947.599
about annually

2944.559 --> 2949.76
constantly like if you write a book it's

2947.599 --> 2950.88
like this is the book well you can put

2949.76 --> 2953.44
the book

2950.88 --> 2955.599
in a closet for 20 years never think

2953.44 --> 2957.76
about it ever and then get it out and

2955.599 --> 2959.92
like oh wow what's this

2957.76 --> 2961.5200000000004
and then yeah it just comes into being

2959.92 --> 2964.559
well

2961.52 --> 2967.599
those traditions greek mythology the old

2964.559 --> 2969.3590000000004
testament they didn't have that luxury

2967.599 --> 2970.319
so they had

2969.359 --> 2973.2
to

2970.319 --> 2975.7599999999998
practice it they had to tell the story

2973.2 --> 2977.81
to keep it alive

2975.76 --> 2981.05
that's the difference

2977.81 --> 2981.0499999999997

3173.359 --> 3179.16
this long i don't know how it's

3174.88 --> 3179.1600000000003

that mandela

3202.4 --> 3206.48
people

3203.68 --> 3209.2
have knowledge i like that the problem

3206.48 --> 3210.64
is is that they're just squirting with

3209.2 --> 3213.2799999999997
it they're just like

3210.64 --> 3214.7999999999997

3213.28 --> 3217.119
scatter guard you with all these things

3214.8 --> 3218.2400000000002

anymore

3218.24 --> 3221.2
how

3219.28 --> 3223.119
get out of here

3221.2 --> 3225.4399999999996
you're hysterical freak

3223.119 --> 3227.04
like get out of here it's just makes me

3225.44 --> 3229.28
want to pick up her broom and just like

3227.04 --> 3233.599
get out

3229.28 --> 3233.599
stop doing that stop spreading your

3234.839 --> 3240.319
hysteria you're being hysterical

3237.839 --> 3240.319
stop it

3242.48 --> 3247.2
right it's really cool that you know all

3244.88 --> 3249.52
these details but you're just being

3247.2 --> 3251.68
hysterical with it how is that supposed

3249.52 --> 3254.92
to improve anything

3251.68 --> 3254.9199999999996
it isn't

3276.64 --> 3282.0789999999997
now is like standing on a kayak

3279.2 --> 3282.0789999999997
that's hilarious

3285.359 --> 3291.52
heliocentric lie is the biggest concern

3289.52 --> 3295.119
not in a direct sense

3291.52 --> 3297.68
i think that the biggest concern is

3295.119 --> 3300.96
a cult of people

3297.68 --> 3302.96
that are not easily pointed at

3300.96 --> 3307.52
at first

3302.96 --> 3309.76
that is making a habit of lying and then

3307.52 --> 3312.799
double speaking there like people that

3309.76 --> 3314.1600000000003
are unrepentingly lying unrepentant

3312.799 --> 3317.599
lying

3314.16 --> 3320.16
is the biggest concern because it's

3317.599 --> 3322.2400000000002
it's in low places and it's in high

3320.16 --> 3324.319
places there are people

3322.24 --> 3326.319
like anti-flat earthers that are so

3324.319 --> 3328.5589999999997
deeply into the double speak that they

3326.319 --> 3329.599
literally don't know what's happening

3328.559 --> 3330.96
anymore

3329.599 --> 3335.3590000000004
literally

3330.96 --> 3338.0
like they are not aware of what they do

3335.359 --> 3340.319
well there's also politicians that are

3338.0 --> 3342.4
so doubling down on their [ __ ]

3340.319 --> 3345.7599999999998
insanity that they're pretty much in the

3342.4 --> 3346.64
same package except these people do

3345.76 --> 3349.44
have

3346.64 --> 3353.04
power or at least

3349.44 --> 3355.599
they should they have official power

3353.04 --> 3358.64
where they're able to actually do things

3355.599 --> 3358.6400000000003
is something else but

3359.68 --> 3362.839
so

3360.48 --> 3366.079
it's not just the philosophy of

3362.839 --> 3368.16
heliocentrism it is the double down on

3366.079 --> 3370.2400000000002
provable lying and double speaking

3368.16 --> 3371.839
especially double speaking with social

3370.24 --> 3374.64
interactions

3371.839 --> 3378.0789999999997
that is the biggest concern right now

3374.64 --> 3381.44
it's not a singular philosophy

3378.079 --> 3383.8390000000004
x320 stop it

3381.44 --> 3386.0
i am going to ban you if you just

3383.839 --> 3387.119
blabber nonsense

3386.0 --> 3389.2
no

3387.119 --> 3393.079
aren't you seeing yourself maybe you

3389.2 --> 3393.0789999999997
should unblock yourself

3407.44 --> 3410.44
uh

3418.319 --> 3422.96
right

3419.359 --> 3424.0
you could say that mandela effect people

3422.96 --> 3427.44
might

3424.0 --> 3429.44
potentially be using mandela effect as a

3427.44 --> 3432.799
form of escapism

3429.44 --> 3434.0
to create mass hysteria among their

3432.799 --> 3436.24
ranks

3434.0 --> 3438.64
so they just feel like everything is so

3436.24 --> 3441.68
fluid we can't do anything about it

3438.64 --> 3444.48
anymore oh wow look at all this freedom

3441.68 --> 3446.72
we don't then have to

3444.48 --> 3450.0
participate in the very

3446.72 --> 3452.16
real physical world confrontations in

3450.0 --> 3453.76
psychological warfare then because

3452.16 --> 3456.96
everything is fluid doesn't matter what

3453.76 --> 3458.88
we do anyway yeah sounds like

3456.96 --> 3461.52
escapism

3458.88 --> 3463.92
which is ignorance

3461.52 --> 3467.44
yeah creating oh everything is fluid

3463.92 --> 3470.48
nothing is real uh everything's changed

3467.44 --> 3473.839
oh oh so oh so then nothing is real

3470.48 --> 3475.92
right well yeah then participating and

3473.839 --> 3478.0789999999997
changing things doesn't really

3475.92 --> 3480.079
help either anymore because nothing is

3478.079 --> 3481.92
real it's all fluid so you can't really

3480.079 --> 3482.7200000000003
contribute oh look at all that freedom

3481.92 --> 3484.799
oh

3482.72 --> 3486.72
i'm free i can't do anything about

3484.799 --> 3489.28
anything because it's all changing oh

3486.72 --> 3490.3999999999996
suddenly i don't have this

3489.28 --> 3493.0400000000004
this

3490.4 --> 3495.76
brood brooding

3493.04 --> 3498.079
doom feeling of responsibility that i

3495.76 --> 3500.48
might actually have to really put in

3498.079 --> 3503.119
effort right now to

3500.48 --> 3505.359
un-route the darkness that is trying to

3503.119 --> 3507.92
take full grasp

3505.359 --> 3508.799
of this realm

3507.92 --> 3510.64
oh

3508.799 --> 3512.079
yeah because that's actually happening

3510.64 --> 3514.16
right now

3512.079 --> 3516.6400000000003
yeah it's now time for escapism this is

3514.16 --> 3518.3999999999996
a time to get real more than ever to

3516.64 --> 3523.68
confront

3518.4 --> 3525.6800000000003
to face the truth and abandon the lies

3523.68 --> 3529.1189999999997
escapism

3525.68 --> 3532.0
into fluidity

3529.119 --> 3533.76
and this undeserved excitement through

3532.0 --> 3534.799
delusion

3533.76 --> 3537.92
it's not

3534.799 --> 3540.24
helping at all

3537.92 --> 3542.7200000000003
at all

3540.24 --> 3544.799
you're not helping people figure out

3542.72 --> 3547.04
cohesion to deal with it like that

3544.799 --> 3548.16
you're just escaping

3547.04 --> 3550.24
you're just laying down your

3548.16 --> 3552.64
responsibility of dealing with the

3550.24 --> 3555.1189999999997
situation that is really right there at

3552.64 --> 3557.5989999999997
hand right there in your face

3555.119 --> 3559.359
it's no more time for escapism guys we

3557.599 --> 3562.4
have to face it now we have to face

3559.359 --> 3564.88
what's really here right now it's not

3562.4 --> 3567.52
fluid it's right there it's right there

3564.88 --> 3567.52
in your face

3571.44 --> 3575.16
async star wars

3590.079 --> 3594.6400000000003
hmm that's weird slow moment buggy

3592.96 --> 3596.96
did you know that i

3594.64 --> 3600.0
i have conscious memory of them and of

3596.96 --> 3603.119
the literal mandela

3600.0 --> 3605.599
in the 90s that he was announced dead on

3603.119 --> 3605.599
the news

3606.319 --> 3613.2799999999997
and then the next day the next day

3610.799 --> 3616.4
they acted like never happened and oh

3613.28 --> 3619.92
look he just came out of the jail

3616.4 --> 3622.48
he wasn't that but they said he was dead

3619.92 --> 3626.0
oh they just acted like it didn't happen

3622.48 --> 3628.2400000000002
and there was even an afterward talking

3626.0 --> 3629.92
program as the dutch you're always so in

3628.24 --> 3632.0789999999997
love with us

3629.92 --> 3634.799
that even disgusted like yeah this is

3632.079 --> 3635.92
just weird

3634.799 --> 3638.16
like

3635.92 --> 3639.44
this is bad media operation i don't know

3638.16 --> 3642.5589999999997
why they're doing it right they're not

3639.44 --> 3645.04
just saying they were wrong the mandela

3642.559 --> 3647.76
effect is basically born

3645.04 --> 3650.0
from a weird media operation

3647.76 --> 3651.599
where they just tried to manipulate

3650.0 --> 3653.68
people pulling their heart strings with

3651.599 --> 3656.7200000000003
how mandela had died when he hadn't died

3653.68 --> 3659.359
and then when he basically came out

3656.72 --> 3661.52
they just acted like it never happened

3659.359 --> 3664.0789999999997
but oh my god they knew

3661.52 --> 3665.839
the people in the media knew what was

3664.079 --> 3668.1600000000003
going on and that that happened and some

3665.839 --> 3671.2799999999997
of them didn't agree with with doing

3668.16 --> 3673.44
that they didn't like it like

3671.28 --> 3676.4
they just were like why can't you just

3673.44 --> 3677.839
say you were wrong

3676.4 --> 3679.599
huh

3677.839 --> 3680.64
i remember that

3679.599 --> 3683.04
because

3680.64 --> 3686.799
me and my family we were like oh big

3683.04 --> 3690.96
mandela fans were so liberal right

3686.799 --> 3693.92
in this relatively still somewhat

3690.96 --> 3696.2400000000002
innocent time for me

3693.92 --> 3700.48
it was like oh mandela has this awesome

3696.24 --> 3702.64
resistance guy in south africa and

3700.48 --> 3704.079
so we were all like oh what he died oh

3702.64 --> 3706.0789999999997
my god

3704.079 --> 3708.319
and then he turned out not to have died

3706.079 --> 3710.2400000000002
and then the media talked about how they

3708.319 --> 3713.04
were wrong about it

3710.24 --> 3716.64
i mean i literally remember seeing that

3713.04 --> 3719.64
on the freaking television on the pilli

3716.64 --> 3719.64
okay

3728.16 --> 3733.7599999999998
ignoring certain [ __ ] up

3731.52 --> 3736.88
i'm not ignoring anything i'm just

3733.76 --> 3739.3590000000004
saying reality is not fluid scatter

3736.88 --> 3742.319
gunning us with weird oddities is not

3739.359 --> 3742.319
helping anyone

3742.64 --> 3747.5989999999997
what is the product of all these

3744.96 --> 3750.0
figuring out mandela effects this can't

3747.599 --> 3751.3590000000004
work that can so what is your conclusion

3750.0 --> 3754.88
with that

3751.359 --> 3757.119
what is the productive new frequency

3754.88 --> 3758.88
that spawns out of it

3757.119 --> 3760.1600000000003
you don't have any

3758.88 --> 3763.28
i'll say

3760.16 --> 3765.68
you don't have any productive end result

3763.28 --> 3768.4
with your mandela findings

3765.68 --> 3770.48
that sounds very familiar yeah that's

3768.4 --> 3772.4
because it's escapism

3770.48 --> 3774.799
and hysteria

3772.4 --> 3777.599
that's what comes out of it you're just

3774.799 --> 3780.96
scandal gunning with things

3777.599 --> 3783.119
that have no point

3780.96 --> 3785.76
what's the point what are you learning

3783.119 --> 3787.92
from it what are you actually doing

3785.76 --> 3790.6400000000003
with it how are you building

3787.92 --> 3792.96
with this knowledge you're not yeah no

3790.64 --> 3797.839
[ __ ]

3792.96 --> 3797.839
yeah because it's escapism and hysteria

3798.0 --> 3802.319
there's no point in dwelling on these

3800.319 --> 3803.44
things at all

3802.319 --> 3806.64
now there's

3803.44 --> 3809.359
a point in trying to figure out complex

3806.64 --> 3811.68
psychological things and maybe even like

3809.359 --> 3813.839
dark world related spiritual effects

3811.68 --> 3815.44
that might also be involved it might be

3813.839 --> 3817.52
very complex

3815.44 --> 3819.839
what is completely pointless though is

3817.52 --> 3821.92
scatter gunning people oh but what about

3819.839 --> 3823.9
this what about that what about that and

3821.92 --> 3825.039
that and that it's all just different

3823.9 --> 3826.88
[Music]

3825.039 --> 3830.4
there's no point

3826.88 --> 3832.559
why are you doing it there's no point

3830.4 --> 3834.1600000000003
it's not productive

3832.559 --> 3838.2000000000003
you're not getting anything out of it

3834.16 --> 3838.2
you're just sowing hysteria

3841.48 --> 3847.2
[Music]

3843.92 --> 3848.88
don't put thoughts into your mouth

3847.2 --> 3850.319
what

3848.88 --> 3853.839
i didn't know you have thoughts in your

3850.319 --> 3853.839
mouth that's weird

3873.44 --> 3878.2400000000002
right

3874.48 --> 3880.319
so just people need to stop

3878.24 --> 3883.4399999999996
you just need to stop the hysteria i

3880.319 --> 3885.839
don't care whether you agree whether it

3883.44 --> 3887.52
is hysteria or not that is effectively

3885.839 --> 3892.16
what is coming out of it it's all very

3887.52 --> 3893.68
exciting yeah hysteria is very exciting

3892.16 --> 3896.3999999999996
didn't you know

3893.68 --> 3899.44
didn't you know that hysteria is very

3896.4 --> 3900.799
exciting how do you think mass hysteria

3899.44 --> 3903.44
happens

3900.799 --> 3906.079
somebody gets hysterical about something

3903.44 --> 3909.599
then other people witness that and they

3906.079 --> 3910.88
are like yeah we're gonna get hysterical

3909.599 --> 3912.559
about that

3910.88 --> 3914.319
and then before you know it mass

3912.559 --> 3916.079
hysteria

3914.319 --> 3919.2
yeah

3916.079 --> 3922.4
so what is the productive conclusion you

3919.2 --> 3923.9199999999996
get out of it out of dealing with it

3922.4 --> 3925.6800000000003
there isn't any

3923.92 --> 3927.6800000000003
yeah i know

3925.68 --> 3930.799
that's my point

3927.68 --> 3932.72
that's why it has no point you shouldn't

3930.799 --> 3937.4
you shouldn't do that

3932.72 --> 3937.3999999999996
it's not healthy it's not productive

3945.2 --> 3948.8799999999997
no it's not about oh my god rickvig not

3947.359 --> 3952.72
you too

3948.88 --> 3956.0
not you as well gods

3952.72 --> 3956.0
it is hysteria

3956.72 --> 3960.8799999999997
you're straw manning me rigvek you're

3958.72 --> 3964.0789999999997
very triggered you're triggered like a

3960.88 --> 3967.119
funding right now yeah just because you

3964.079 --> 3970.1600000000003
can't see oh i can't see it no i can see

3967.119 --> 3972.1600000000003
it i can absolutely see it i've heard

3970.16 --> 3974.24
all these scatter gunning shitty

3972.16 --> 3976.0789999999997
examples i've looked into them

3974.24 --> 3978.24
everything

3976.079 --> 3981.3590000000004
you know what my conclusion was it's

3978.24 --> 3984.0789999999997
[ __ ] pointless it's completely

3981.359 --> 3986.5589999999997
pointless there is nothing you can get

3984.079 --> 3990.6400000000003
out of it that is productive all of it

3986.559 --> 3993.76
is a waste of time so very exciting

3990.64 --> 3999.68
but it does not enhance your grip over

3993.76 --> 4001.76
reality in the contrary it is hysteria

3999.68 --> 4004.0
bro

4001.76 --> 4008.4
yeah i've lived it too

4004.0 --> 4010.0
rick beck i've lived it yesterday

4008.4 --> 4012.7200000000003
today

4010.0 --> 4015.039
i've gave an example of being confronted

4012.72 --> 4015.7599999999998
with something that is very confusing to

4015.039 --> 4018.2400000000002
me

4015.76 --> 4019.28
do i now start hysterically scattergun

4018.24 --> 4020.4799999999996
about it

4019.28 --> 4022.88
no

4020.48 --> 4025.119
i'm not like oh my god this means the

4022.88 --> 4026.96
mantellive people were right afterwards

4025.119 --> 4030.1600000000003
all fluid oh

4026.96 --> 4033.799
no i'm not gonna play the game i'm not

4030.16 --> 4033.799
gonna be hysterical

4034.079 --> 4039.8390000000004
reality is reality our minds are the

4037.76 --> 4042.6400000000003
things that are fluent

4039.839 --> 4044.72
not reality not like that

4042.64 --> 4045.52
there may be some other weird [ __ ] going

4044.72 --> 4047.68
on

4045.52 --> 4050.0
like serious freaky magic

4047.68 --> 4053.839
interdimensional perhaps

4050.0 --> 4053.839
reality is reality

4053.88 --> 4060.319
uncorruptable things cannot change

4057.92 --> 4062.7200000000003
huh why do you think jesus's words have

4060.319 --> 4065.68
never changed think other things in the

4062.72 --> 4067.1189999999997
bible yeah ever thought about that

4065.68 --> 4068.8799999999997
anybody huh

4067.119 --> 4070.48
ever thought about that that maybe the

4068.88 --> 4072.48
incorruptible things in this world

4070.48 --> 4075.28
cannot be altered

4072.48 --> 4077.2
even in our minds it's outside of reach

4075.28 --> 4080.1600000000003
of morpheus

4077.2 --> 4082.3999999999996
the giant the demon giant of dreams it's

4080.16 --> 4084.319
outside of his reach he can't alter it

4082.4 --> 4086.319
pure things cannot be altered in the

4084.319 --> 4088.48
mind through mandela effect like

4086.319 --> 4091.2
situations ever anybody ever thought

4088.48 --> 4092.2400000000002
about that no never

4091.2 --> 4093.359
i did

4092.24 --> 4095.0389999999998
huh

4093.359 --> 4097.359
while you were all hysterically

4095.039 --> 4100.719
scattergunning all your examples have

4097.359 --> 4100.719
you ever even considered that

4101.92 --> 4105.1990000000005
that maybe

4103.199 --> 4107.199
the corruptable things

4105.199 --> 4109.599999999999
change or appear to change through

4107.199 --> 4113.839
mandela which i think is

4109.6 --> 4116.96
considered could be considered morpheus

4113.839 --> 4118.64
the demon giant altering our minds

4116.96 --> 4121.44
testing those

4118.64 --> 4124.2390000000005
who might be seduced seducing

4121.44 --> 4127.04
impurity right impure things in pure

4124.239 --> 4128.48
things might be altered like that

4127.04 --> 4130.839
pure things

4128.48 --> 4132.718999999999
not altered

4130.839 --> 4134.3189999999995
huh

4132.719 --> 4136.96
so in your

4134.319 --> 4138.400000000001
five years of studying all the mandela

4136.96 --> 4140.0
effect have you even come to that

4138.4 --> 4140.96
conclusion yet

4140.0 --> 4144.839
huh

4140.96 --> 4147.359
because me the guy that doesn't dig into

4144.839 --> 4148.64
mandela early long

4147.359 --> 4149.6
i have

4148.64 --> 4151.759
yeah

4149.6 --> 4154.64
so what have you got to give for all

4151.759 --> 4158.64
your years of wasting your time on that

4154.64 --> 4160.799
have you come to this conclusion yet huh

4158.64 --> 4162.159000000001
ever thought about this

4160.799 --> 4165.359
that maybe

4162.159 --> 4168.48
the pure cannot be altered

4165.359 --> 4170.400000000001
and that is the unpure that is being

4168.48 --> 4172.3189999999995
subjected to this weird apparent

4170.4 --> 4175.839
alteration we think of as the mandela

4172.319 --> 4175.839000000001
effect huh

4178.0 --> 4183.799
now put a cork in it and [ __ ] the [ __ ]

4180.799 --> 4183.799
down

4188.279 --> 4193.64
[Music]

4196.7 --> 4200.09
[Music]

4215.52 --> 4219.92
yeah

4217.44 --> 4222.719
all your years of studying it and

4219.92 --> 4226.8
blabbering on about it

4222.719 --> 4226.8
i thought together maybe spent like

4226.96 --> 4231.28
three hours total

4228.88 --> 4234.88
throughout my entire life looking into

4231.28 --> 4237.36
video material into examples videos like

4234.88 --> 4239.28
three hours altogether and just thinking

4237.36 --> 4240.48
about it a while

4239.28 --> 4242.48
yeah

4240.48 --> 4245.5199999999995
so where did you

4242.48 --> 4249.44
come up with a brilliant overarching

4245.52 --> 4251.679
idea that makes all the pieces fit huh

4249.44 --> 4253.919999999999

welcome to the oracle

4279.68 --> 4285.27
[Music]

4289.12 --> 4292.679
now we need a breather

4320.88 --> 4324.2390000000005
yeah mandela effect in the bible for

4322.96 --> 4327.04
sure

4324.239 --> 4329.12
but not with jesus's words though george

4327.04 --> 4332.56
sanford huh huh

4329.12 --> 4334.32
the rest oh yeah i literally

4332.56 --> 4337.76
witnessed it

4334.32 --> 4340.159
how it was being done

4337.76 --> 4343.52
before i ever heard it out in the

4340.159 --> 4346.32
outside world yeah

4343.52 --> 4346.320000000001
witnessed it

4346.8 --> 4351.1990000000005
black santa claus or the black pope or

4349.04 --> 4353.44
whatever the hell he was in the dark

4351.199 --> 4355.599999999999
well it was not the physical real world

4353.44 --> 4357.199
absolutely not but it was something that

4355.6 --> 4359.4400000000005
was really happening

4357.199 --> 4362.239
alteration of the bible i was right

4359.44 --> 4364.4
there in the room as the bible was just

4362.239 --> 4366.08
passed on and a question was asked to

4364.4 --> 4369.44
everybody that was there

4366.08 --> 4372.159
what do you want to change and i heard

4369.44 --> 4375.12
wine skins the bottles somebody inserted

4372.159 --> 4377.28
a unicorn somebody inserted a smiley and

4375.12 --> 4380.08
i said

4377.28 --> 4382.719
call the lord bill because that is who

4380.08 --> 4386.88
he really is

4382.719 --> 4389.12
huh i had to do a little truth thing

4386.88 --> 4389.12
me

4390.56 --> 4395.1990000000005
yeah

4391.36 --> 4398.159
this was even before i ever heard

4395.199 --> 4403.159
about supposed mandela effect changing

4398.159 --> 4403.159
anything i was there man

4405.01 --> 4408.22
[Music]

4416.239 --> 4419.199
yes robert

4417.679 --> 4421.4400000000005
yes of course quantum of conscious is

4419.199 --> 4423.678999999999
talking a lot about it

4421.44 --> 4426.0
there is a lot to be talked about and he

4423.679 --> 4429.4400000000005
does look quantum of conscious really

4426.0 --> 4432.08
gets the psychological part

4429.44 --> 4433.44
and he is trying another template of

4432.08 --> 4435.28
approach

4433.44 --> 4437.599999999999
he's doing it very eloquently he

4435.28 --> 4439.599999999999
understands the dangers of scatter

4437.6 --> 4442.56
gunning nonsense and then being

4439.6 --> 4445.1990000000005
hysterical he he bypasses it in his own

4442.56 --> 4447.120000000001
way so yes

4445.199 --> 4449.759999999999
quando of conscious operates in a

4447.12 --> 4453.44
different way as i do

4449.76 --> 4455.52
but he is a traveler he is a traveler of

4453.44 --> 4459.44
information like me

4455.52 --> 4463.1990000000005
he knows he understands building it

4459.44 --> 4463.199
and i really appreciate his input

4464.64 --> 4468.56
even though it's very different from the

4466.4 --> 4470.639999999999
way i do things sometimes i'm much more

4468.56 --> 4473.6
just like

4470.64 --> 4476.64
straight in your face just connecting to

4473.6 --> 4479.1990000000005
you oh oh you thought you had all these

4476.64 --> 4481.52
oh authority protection layers all right

4479.199 --> 4483.28
and like boom

4481.52 --> 4485.679
right to the heart

4483.28 --> 4487.92
that's the way i do it quantum of

4485.679 --> 4489.76
conscious is much more subtle

4487.92 --> 4492.56
he's just like

4489.76 --> 4494.56
weaving it and weaving it and until you

4492.56 --> 4496.2390000000005
basically start tapping into his

4494.56 --> 4497.92
frequency and then you see what he's

4496.239 --> 4500.5599999999995
doing

4497.92 --> 4502.159
he does it very differently

4500.56 --> 4503.6
i'm much more of a

4502.159 --> 4505.66
boom

4503.6 --> 4511.619000000001
right there

4505.66 --> 4511.619
[Music]

4519.36 --> 4524.639999999999

did you feel

4534.96 --> 4538.4800000000005
that i was right that you were

4536.64 --> 4540.159000000001
hysterical and now you're rejecting and

4538.48 --> 4542.4
everybody's triggered rick beck's

4540.159 --> 4547.12
triggered gadget inspectors triggered

4542.4 --> 4549.28
were you all getting sucked in

4547.12 --> 4551.84
by the mandela devil

4549.28 --> 4553.92
were you i'm not blaming you especially

4551.84 --> 4557.6
young people young people are more

4553.92 --> 4560.2390000000005
vulnerable to mandela mass hysteria than

4557.6 --> 4562.96
older people

4560.239 --> 4566.199
uh-huh yeah another thing i'm calling

4562.96 --> 4566.199
right here

4572.48 --> 4578.4
okay thank you robert yeah i think so

4574.96 --> 4580.56
too sounds arrogant i guess but

4578.4 --> 4582.0
can't help it this [ __ ] started when i

4580.56 --> 4584.64
was five

4582.0 --> 4586.64
i was doing this sort of oracling when i

4584.64 --> 4589.4400000000005
was freaking five

4586.64 --> 4589.4400000000005
to adults

4592.88 --> 4597.12
i made for this

4595.52 --> 4598.64
literally

4597.12 --> 4600.159
i feel sometimes

4598.64 --> 4601.12
like

4600.159 --> 4604.32
like

4601.12 --> 4604.32
zeus did it or something

4605.199 --> 4608.639999999999
it just

4606.239 --> 4610.639999999999
i'm called arwen it's nectar of the gods

4608.64 --> 4613.6
this is what i do this is the purpose of

4610.64 --> 4613.6
me being here

4616.239 --> 4621.879999999999
like if i wouldn't be able to do it i

4618.0 --> 4621.88
would be worth [ __ ]

4623.28 --> 4628.88
i would just be a dumb normie like

4626.0 --> 4630.719
probably worse than average dumb normie

4628.88 --> 4633.12
i'm not even joking

4630.719 --> 4635.28
it's all because i held on to this from

4633.12 --> 4636.96
the first moment i wake up woke up in my

4635.28 --> 4641.639999999999
conscience is that

4636.96 --> 4641.64
this is what i am this is what i do

4650.08 --> 4654.76
okay chris

4651.52 --> 4654.76
i'm 42.

4675.199 --> 4679.678999999999
even gullible

4676.64 --> 4683.0
who are you referring to

4679.679 --> 4683.0
then whites

4709.04 --> 4712.04
hmm

4720.4 --> 4726.4
wow rest ahead is super triggered in my

4723.52 --> 4728.64
skype chat i'm gonna ignore him

4726.4 --> 4730.32
he just needs to get the [ __ ] over this

4728.64 --> 4733.88
[ __ ]

4730.32 --> 4733.88
or stay away

4743.44 --> 4747.28
yeah

4744.32 --> 4750.5599999999995
i mean he is for some reason that it

4747.28 --> 4752.32
totally eludes me it's really sad for me

4750.56 --> 4755.120000000001
to see it

4752.32 --> 4757.44
he's obsessed with mandela effect

4755.12 --> 4759.599999999999
i bet he's looked into it thousands of

4757.44 --> 4761.44
hours by now like any typical mandela

4759.6 --> 4763.679
obsessed person

4761.44 --> 4765.678999999999
and he hasn't even brought me a

4763.679 --> 4770.4
conclusion like oh

4765.679 --> 4770.4
maybe the pure things can't be affected

4771.6 --> 4776.8
so rasta had with your intellect that's

4774.0 --> 4779.199
you're quicker than me mentally you're

4776.8 --> 4779.1990000000005
quicker

4780.48 --> 4785.04
you haven't even come to this conclusion

4782.88 --> 4789.0
and you're in it

4785.04 --> 4789.0
that's pathetic my man

4790.88 --> 4795.92
you should stop this

4793.44 --> 4799.4
you're being parasited on and you're

4795.92 --> 4799.4
letting it happen

4800.48 --> 4804.589999999999
[Music]

4805.36 --> 4812.0
where's your productive conclusions

4809.12 --> 4812.0
where where is it

4813.44 --> 4819.839999999999
you can't just dig into a subject spend

4817.6 --> 4821.92
hours and hours just staring at it

4819.84 --> 4825.76
listening at it thinking about it and

4821.92 --> 4828.639
then not come to a productive conclusion

4825.76 --> 4831.52
that's a sin

4828.639 --> 4834.159000000001
that means you're using it like a drug

4831.52 --> 4835.280000000001
you're escaping you're not producing

4834.159 --> 4837.12
you're not

4835.28 --> 4840.32
getting new conclusions you're not

4837.12 --> 4841.84
growing anything mentally or physically

4840.32 --> 4844.719
like that

4841.84 --> 4847.1990000000005
you're just wasting your time on it then

4844.719 --> 4850.08
well how can you then defend it with

4847.199 --> 4852.48
such zealotry

4850.08 --> 4855.12
when you know it hasn't yielded anything

4852.48 --> 4855.12
productive

4855.36 --> 4859.48
how can you do that to yourself

4861.76 --> 4867.360000000001
right anyhow i am rounding out the show

4864.32 --> 4867.36
man time is flown

4868.96 --> 4872.8
very little to do with science today

4870.96 --> 4874.56
more with mandela effect but i don't

4872.8 --> 4876.639
want to call it that or otherwise my

4874.56 --> 4878.400000000001
entire chat's going to be spam full with

4876.639 --> 4880.4800000000005
this hysteria [ __ ]

4878.4 --> 4883.759999999999
and i don't want that

4880.48 --> 4886.239
i want some basic inquiry

4883.76 --> 4888.159000000001
right about my very specific example

4886.239 --> 4889.44
that i've talked about now like given as

4888.159 --> 4892.08
an example

4889.44 --> 4892.719
like five times in last two days that's

4892.08 --> 4894.5599999999995
it

4892.719 --> 4896.719
i don't need your scatter gunning i

4894.56 --> 4900.120000000001
don't need to know how entire reality is

4896.719 --> 4900.12
fluid now

4903.92 --> 4908.08
anyhow

4905.6 --> 4911.280000000001

4942.56 --> 4946.8
and you're just gonna get in my way and

4944.239 --> 4948.159
now you want me to go bust maybe

4946.8 --> 4949.1990000000005

4959.199 --> 4964.159
get my hint oh oh

4961.199 --> 4966.799999999999
and don't forget i just figured out

4964.159 --> 4968.4
something really big about that thing

4966.8 --> 4970.639
you're dwelling on

4968.4 --> 4973.12
without spending more than three hours

4970.639 --> 4974.56
in total on the entire subject

4973.12 --> 4976.719
yeah

4974.56 --> 4979.04
i haven't heard any mandela person

4976.719 --> 4981.199
including brian stavely come to that

4979.04 --> 4983.44
conclusion though so what have you been

4981.199 --> 4986.599999999999
doing with all those thousands of hours

4983.44 --> 4986.599999999999
you wasted

4986.719 --> 4990.0
yeah

4988.08 --> 4992.159
i needed three hours

4990.0 --> 4993.679
and i came to an overarching conclusion

4992.159 --> 4995.44
that's very helpful for you to

4993.679 --> 4997.92
understand better what the [ __ ] you even

4995.44 --> 4999.839999999999
believe in yeah what have you done with

4997.92 --> 5002.88
your thousands hours wasting on that

4999.84 --> 5004.639
[ __ ] nothing getting hysterical learning

5002.88 --> 5008.0
how to scatter gun people until they

5004.639 --> 5011.12
shut up stop resisting you yeah i know

5008.0 --> 5011.12
not very productive

5011.52 --> 5014.4800000000005

i'll be back tomorrow with flat earth
