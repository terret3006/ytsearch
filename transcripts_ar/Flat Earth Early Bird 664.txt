it's actually kind of cold outside

94.799 --> 101.52000000000001
and it was very cold this night as well

101.52 --> 105.2
it's so beautiful but it

103.36 --> 107.52
could get really cold well i totally

105.2 --> 110.64
called it because yesterday night it was

107.52 --> 113.439
getting really chilly

110.64 --> 113.759
it was weird the wind just kept up but

113.439 --> 116.55999999999999
this

113.759 --> 117.68
it's the cold wind mostly so there is a

116.56 --> 119.68
lot of sun

117.68 --> 121.119
but unless you're sitting in a wind-free

119.68 --> 124.47900000000001
spot

121.119 --> 124.479
it's gonna get pretty cold

127.2 --> 131.92000000000002
yeah but hey it's wind free inside of

129.84 --> 135.599
here so

131.92 --> 136.48
it's pretty nice oh yeah but outside i'm

135.599 --> 138.319
not gonna

136.48 --> 140.84
go out and get groceries like in my

138.319 --> 142.879

all right so anyway uh

192.48 --> 200.959
how are you all doing uh

198.0 --> 200.959
yeah yesterday

201.12 --> 209.44
was a good day i think

204.959 --> 209.44
got some notes not too extensive though

209.92 --> 214.64
well yeah retroactively i renamed the

211.92 --> 217.04
show yesterday

214.64 --> 218.879
bring back and modernize chastity belts

217.04 --> 220.959
i was thinking of naming it that i kind

218.879 --> 225.599
of forgot so i did it

220.959 --> 225.599
now because that yeah that was really

225.68 --> 229.20000000000002
a noteworthy point that i was making i

228.48 --> 230.959
think

229.2 --> 232.64
whatever people are gonna think of it i

230.959 --> 233.92000000000002
bet there's a whole lot of people gonna

232.64 --> 238.83999999999997
squirt over it

233.92 --> 241.2
of course i still think it should be

238.84 --> 244.879
said

241.2 --> 248.159
ah rajeev been busy i think a lot of

244.879 --> 248.159

371.36 --> 377.12
24 7 flat earth arena yeah yeah

374.56 --> 379.44
i oh i think yeah i forgot to make a

377.12 --> 381.44
note about that but i did watch that too

379.44 --> 382.96
very late in the night and i put some

381.44 --> 384.88
comments there like

382.96 --> 386.4
john was going against them and the

384.88 --> 389.6
ballers were just being

386.4 --> 392.56
obtuse and annoying as [ __ ] and

389.6 --> 393.44
john just john went just full berserk

392.56 --> 396.24
against them

393.44 --> 398.24
like more more rough than he even does

396.24 --> 402.479
on the flat earth debates

398.24 --> 402.479
he was like really potty mouth and [ __ ]

403.12 --> 409.52
but i guess he was in that kind of mood

406.479 --> 412.4
and i did watch that and that was

409.52 --> 412.4
pretty late at night

414.96 --> 421.35999999999996
yeah i can fit it in there right uh yeah

418.4 --> 424.71999999999997
also oh benjamin was live

421.36 --> 427.12
good stuff no wait it wasn't live was it

424.72 --> 427.12
was it

429.199 --> 437.599
ah i don't remember confused

433.12 --> 440.96
magnetic west

437.599 --> 443.039
it was totally out there when i heard of

440.96 --> 443.039
it

443.28 --> 446.15999999999997
anyway uh

446.479 --> 453.199
right yeah i watched a really unusual

450.0 --> 455.759
movie on netflix that i i

453.199 --> 457.759
that was weird i didn't really like it

455.759 --> 458.08000000000004
but i kind of had to watch through it to

457.759 --> 460.88
see

458.08 --> 460.88
what it would be

461.199 --> 466.0
but it started yeah it's called i'm

463.52 --> 466.24
thinking of ending things and it's like

466.0 --> 469.199
an

466.24 --> 470.24
art it's kind of like an art house style

469.199 --> 473.52000000000004
movie

470.24 --> 473.52
it was basically about

473.919 --> 481.35999999999996
very whiny woman girl

477.44 --> 481.36
and this yeah a bit of a

482.479 --> 490.4
cockish lots of issue

485.919 --> 490.4
guy and them as a couple

490.639 --> 493.84000000000003
sort of star yeah and she was constantly

492.879 --> 496.16
like in her yeah

493.84 --> 497.67999999999995
it was inner dialogue like oh yeah i'm

496.16 --> 500.0
gonna leave him and i'm gonna

497.68 --> 501.599
like the entire [ __ ] movie it was so

500.0 --> 503.68
annoying

501.599 --> 505.199
and then eventually like things got kind

503.68 --> 507.52
of surreal

505.199 --> 508.639
and that part was kind of interesting

507.52 --> 511.44
how they did that

508.639 --> 511.44
she kind of like

512.039 --> 516.8
hallucinatory transit it from just

515.12 --> 518.399
regularly being there and then in

516.8 --> 520.7189999999999
annoying moments very

518.399 --> 522.159
very smartly timed by the director

520.719 --> 523.839
that's afterward

522.159 --> 525.68
it was kind of an interesting movie

523.839 --> 527.6
after all i just thought that the

525.68 --> 530.64
dialogue was terrible

527.6 --> 532.88
not just annoying not terribly done it

530.64 --> 535.279
was kind of realistic but just

532.88 --> 537.12
these people annoyed the [ __ ] out of me

535.279 --> 538.88
i was literally yelling at the screen

537.12 --> 542.48
regularly like ah

538.88 --> 546.64
stop being so passive stop whining

542.48 --> 548.88
this is but the movie itself

546.64 --> 550.64
was directed very interesting the story

548.88 --> 553.92
was kind of like

550.64 --> 556.959
depressing bleak

553.92 --> 557.279
very negative because they were negative

556.959 --> 559.8389999999999
but

557.279 --> 561.279
with bits of wisdom thrown in between

559.839 --> 562.0
there as well and it was really about

561.279 --> 564.56
mortality

562.0 --> 566.32
most of it avoiding that film i can

564.56 --> 569.04
imagine tiny wumble

566.32 --> 572.48
but yeah i got through it sat through it

569.04 --> 572.48
and it's really just about

572.8 --> 578.8
she was looking at the guy's parents

576.399 --> 580.56
and basically like as they was as she

578.8 --> 583.4399999999999
was sitting there imagining

580.56 --> 584.959
how it would be to visit them later when

583.44 --> 586.24
they would be much older getting

584.959 --> 589.5189999999999
demented and even

586.24 --> 593.04
dying and it was mixing up like

589.519 --> 596.08
his mother was dying and then

593.04 --> 598.64
his her father his father came in

596.08 --> 599.44
as a young person didn't even notice

598.64 --> 601.519
that it was

599.44 --> 602.8000000000001
totally surreal like that that was

601.519 --> 605.839
really interesting

602.8 --> 605.8389999999999
it was fascinating

606.56 --> 609.76
so are we in watching weird films so we

608.64 --> 612.959
don't have to

609.76 --> 616.079
right yeah but yeah i had to like

612.959 --> 617.68
protect myself not to get too

616.079 --> 619.279
engaged and it wasn't because i thought

617.68 --> 620.4799999999999
the characters were annoying so that

619.279 --> 623.279
kind of helped

620.48 --> 624.24
because yeah if you really sympathize

623.279 --> 627.04
with this [ __ ]

624.24 --> 627.6
i bet you could contract depression from

627.04 --> 630.079
it

627.6 --> 632.48
it is kind of a dangerous film like that

630.079 --> 635.8389999999999
and was aware of it

632.48 --> 637.9200000000001
so yeah you probably picked up on that

635.839 --> 639.7600000000001
it is depressing

637.92 --> 642.24
because these people don't have the

639.76 --> 645.04
tools to fix it the characters

642.24 --> 646.64
in the movie don't have the tools to get

645.04 --> 649.12
out of their problems

646.64 --> 649.68
and it's very apparent and it rubs off

649.12 --> 651.279
and they're

649.68 --> 654.2399999999999
they're squirting over that

651.279 --> 654.24
psychologically

654.32 --> 661.36
right but

658.079 --> 662.959
yeah as an entire movie piece i thought

661.36 --> 664.88
afterward that it was kind of

662.959 --> 668.16
interesting

664.88 --> 671.4399999999999
what did i gain from it well it was like

668.16 --> 677.12
what it did is it's just

671.44 --> 677.12
super confronting with like universally

677.6 --> 683.44
bad moments like when you're really down

681.2 --> 684.72
your thoughts will wonder in a certain

683.44 --> 687.6800000000001
way

684.72 --> 689.0400000000001
and that part was very well expressed by

687.68 --> 691.12
the movie but yeah

689.04 --> 692.399
if you don't defend against it it's very

691.12 --> 695.68
easy to rub off

692.399 --> 702.0
through sympathy that's

695.68 --> 704.16
that's the dangerous part about it

702.0 --> 705.36
right and it almost like seemed to

704.16 --> 708.88
almost turn into

705.36 --> 710.32
like a a horror movie halfway because of

708.88 --> 712.0
the surrealness but that

710.32 --> 714.839
never really happened it's really

712.0 --> 717.839
psychological it's purely psychological

714.839 --> 717.839
movie

718.88 --> 722.959
but man there was so many typical things

721.68 --> 726.6389999999999
there's like all this

722.959 --> 728.6389999999999
bad common behavior and in family

726.639 --> 730.72
it's completely filled out with like

728.639 --> 732.88
every typical mistake

730.72 --> 733.9200000000001
a lot of people do make with families

732.88 --> 737.92
and how parents

733.92 --> 740.399
behave and yeah

737.92 --> 741.04
and that part about it was really study

740.399 --> 744.639
worthy

741.04 --> 747.68
in retrospect

744.639 --> 749.2
because it yeah by that by these

747.68 --> 752.0
examples it does

749.2 --> 754.24
confront you a lot with your personal

752.0 --> 756.16
problems that most people will probably

754.24 --> 759.519
try to hide from

756.16 --> 761.279
see and that way it's a very confronting

759.519 --> 763.2
movie and i thought that was interesting

761.279 --> 765.8389999999999
about it

763.2 --> 765.839
right so

766.24 --> 772.5600000000001
yeah i'm thinking of ending things

770.0 --> 773.2
and yeah it's not about suicide nobody

772.56 --> 776.3199999999999
commits

773.2 --> 777.2
suicide in this movie even though it

776.32 --> 780.0
almost yeah

777.2 --> 780.5600000000001
even the title almost suggests that but

780.0 --> 784.24
it's not

780.56 --> 787.1999999999999
it's not about that it's i'm thinking of

784.24 --> 789.76
ending things it's more about

787.2 --> 791.36
just in the moment like people that are

789.76 --> 793.4399999999999
stuck in the feeling of

791.36 --> 795.279
i'm gonna walk away from this i'm i'm

793.44 --> 796.72
quitting this it's too much it's not

795.279 --> 800.0
gonna lead to something like

796.72 --> 802.32
self your ego imposes negative

800.0 --> 803.519
things upon the situation so you don't

802.32 --> 805.44
engage that

803.519 --> 807.279
element is really what the movie is

805.44 --> 810.32
about and the title

807.279 --> 813.519
just so you know it's a psychological

810.32 --> 816.639
movie surreal parts in it

813.519 --> 821.92
very confrontational and it is

816.639 --> 821.92
made like an art house type of movie

822.56 --> 829.3599999999999
so yeah so you know

827.519 --> 831.199
can watch it or you can watch it but if

829.36 --> 834.0790000000001
you watch it make sure you

831.199 --> 835.5999999999999
are like not going to emotionally

834.079 --> 836.88
connect too much with the characters

835.6 --> 839.839
because then you might

836.88 --> 840.8
especially in this time period ending of

839.839 --> 842.72
summer

840.8 --> 844.0
it might just rub off on you you don't

842.72 --> 845.9200000000001
want that

844.0 --> 848.24
if you're starting to notice that i i

845.92 --> 850.399
just turned it off

848.24 --> 852.0790000000001
i had to walk away for yeah pause it and

850.399 --> 856.399
walk away for a few moments

852.079 --> 858.399
and then got back again

856.399 --> 860.88
what is gravity it's a reification

858.399 --> 860.88
fallacy

860.959 --> 870.88
have i seen the muthan movie sinister

864.079 --> 873.5999999999999
i'm not sure i might have

870.88 --> 876.48
might have if it's really recent then

873.6 --> 876.48
probably not

882.839 --> 885.839
2012.

890.48 --> 894.48
no i don't think i've seen that from the

893.12 --> 899.839
trailer i'm just

894.48 --> 899.839
glancing at

910.839 --> 917.12
no

913.279 --> 920.639
yeah maggot brain oh these names

917.12 --> 924.5600000000001
like why

920.639 --> 926.88
do people that present themselves as

924.56 --> 928.7199999999999
ballers at this point choose these names

926.88 --> 933.92
for their account is this like

928.72 --> 936.8000000000001
trendy or

933.92 --> 938.88
why are you doing this like some of

936.8 --> 941.3599999999999
these baller trolls

938.88 --> 942.079
i don't get it are they even trolls are

941.36 --> 944.48
they

942.079 --> 944.4799999999999
are they

945.199 --> 950.16
flat earthers undercover presenting

947.92 --> 951.04
themselves as stupid i don't understand

950.16 --> 953.4399999999999
this

951.04 --> 954.3199999999999
like why would somebody call themselves

953.44 --> 956.72
that

954.32 --> 959.9200000000001
like why does ed and jaiki and all these

956.72 --> 962.9590000000001
people even take these names

959.92 --> 964.399
when you're literally just naming

962.959 --> 970.399
yourself

964.399 --> 970.399
after failure and weakness and stupidity

973.199 --> 978.88
yeah i'm sure it is there's a

976.48 --> 979.6800000000001
song name of everything you can possibly

978.88 --> 982.8
imagine

979.68 --> 985.7589999999999
that's not really a good reason

982.8 --> 987.3599999999999
to pick that as a name when you're

985.759 --> 990.5600000000001
getting in a flat earth

987.36 --> 991.36
chat and then saying global things you

990.56 --> 993.5999999999999
know

991.36 --> 994.399
it's not helping the globe religion so

993.6 --> 998.48
it almost

994.399 --> 998.48
seems like you're doing that on purpose

1005.68 --> 1013.199
hey rest ahead but

1009.12 --> 1016.88
yeah why why well well relative density

1013.199 --> 1017.8389999999999
that's why gravity is a reification

1016.88 --> 1019.4399999999999
fallacy

1017.839 --> 1021.759
the real thing that is actually

1019.44 --> 1024.799
happening that is transpiring that has

1021.759 --> 1025.679
provable force explains the entire

1024.799 --> 1028.4
mechanism

1025.679 --> 1030.48
to the extent that some people even say

1028.4 --> 1033.919
that it should be a natural law

1030.48 --> 1035.439
qe mainly i don't really care either way

1033.919 --> 1039.199
i just know it's proven

1035.439 --> 1040.72
relative density causes you to roll down

1039.199 --> 1045.52
a hill faster

1040.72 --> 1045.52
than when you're trying to ride up it

1050.16 --> 1053.8400000000001
yeah get it

1054.0 --> 1059.919
if you're surrounded by medium

1057.679 --> 1060.96
that is less dense than you then like

1059.919 --> 1063.76
air then you

1060.96 --> 1066.16
and your bike will start to move

1063.76 --> 1067.36
downward but if something is obstructing

1066.16 --> 1070.64
that

1067.36 --> 1070.9599999999998
but you can still maneuver because you

1070.64 --> 1074.72
have

1070.96 --> 1076.16
wheels that can basically help the

1074.72 --> 1080.4
rolling process

1076.16 --> 1083.919
then you will go towards the lower point

1080.4 --> 1085.8400000000001
by the shortest path because you're

1083.919 --> 1088.48
still going to be surrounded

1085.84 --> 1089.6
by air you're still basically stuck in a

1088.48 --> 1092.72
medium of air whether

1089.6 --> 1095.039
it is on a diagonal slope or not

1092.72 --> 1096.799
so you will have this downward force

1095.039 --> 1098.64
because of the disequilibrium with your

1096.799 --> 1101.28
surrounding

1098.64 --> 1103.1200000000001
but yeah you will the entire thing will

1101.28 --> 1104.48
try to find its shortest path so if

1103.12 --> 1108.2399999999998
you're on a slope

1104.48 --> 1108.799
then it will go like the slope will

1108.24 --> 1111.44
literally

1108.799 --> 1111.44
like push

1112.4 --> 1116.64
causing the lateral movement

1121.36 --> 1126.32
do you understand i just explained it to

1123.44 --> 1126.3200000000002
you just now

1130.0 --> 1134.0
now in a vacuum chamber it's exactly the

1132.16 --> 1137.8400000000001
same thing a vacuum chamber

1134.0 --> 1141.679
is just even lower

1137.84 --> 1143.6
density medium it's lower than air it's

1141.679 --> 1144.96
less pressure there's less material the

1143.6 --> 1147.6
density on average

1144.96 --> 1148.559
volumetric wise compared to you the

1147.6 --> 1151.039
object

1148.559 --> 1152.96
or whatever isn't there is going to be

1151.039 --> 1156.16
even less than so there's going to be

1152.96 --> 1158.08
even more maximized

1156.16 --> 1159.76
this equilibrium from the relative

1158.08 --> 1162.799
density

1159.76 --> 1165.76
effect the force

1162.799 --> 1167.039
that this equilibrium force so and

1165.76 --> 1179.6
there's less

1167.039 --> 1182.16
yeah friction also

1179.6 --> 1182.1599999999999
you get it

1182.64 --> 1188.24
get it yet the only thing that really

1186.08 --> 1191.52
determines this

1188.24 --> 1192.0
displacement in the two vectors up and

1191.52 --> 1195.44
down

1192.0 --> 1195.919
right in every way the natural motion

1195.44 --> 1198.24
without

1195.919 --> 1199.76
extra forces introduced is all explained

1198.24 --> 1201.44
through relative density

1199.76 --> 1207.84
and it doesn't matter whether it is in a

1201.44 --> 1207.8400000000001
vacuum or not

1208.88 --> 1215.3600000000001
no you're not listening again it's only

1212.4 --> 1216.0800000000002
the relative part has nothing to do with

1215.36 --> 1218.3999999999999
what is in

1216.08 --> 1220.32
any direction the directions are set no

1218.4 --> 1223.3600000000001
matter what do you understand

1220.32 --> 1223.84
up and down is set no matter what it's

1223.36 --> 1226.7199999999998
just

1223.84 --> 1228.72
a given it's there it's provable you

1226.72 --> 1229.919
can't prove it goes in any other

1228.72 --> 1232.96
direction

1229.919 --> 1236.5590000000002
without another force

1232.96 --> 1239.1200000000001
causing it to evade all right

1236.559 --> 1241.28
and it's not yeah it's because the

1239.12 --> 1245.84
object is in a medium

1241.28 --> 1245.84
surrounded by right

1246.08 --> 1250.3999999999999
that is less dense than it well in that

1249.12 --> 1252.2399999999998
case it's going to go down

1250.4 --> 1254.88
if it is surrounded by a medium that is

1252.24 --> 1258.0
denser than it it will go up

1254.88 --> 1258.0
that's the way it works

1259.919 --> 1264.24
you don't accept that well then you're a

1262.24 --> 1267.2
[ __ ] and you're literally

1264.24 --> 1267.919
not listening either or you don't

1267.2 --> 1272.24
recognize

1267.919 --> 1273.919
provable scientific fact maggot brain

1272.24 --> 1276.08
up and down our set no it's not a

1273.919 --> 1279.2800000000002
baseless searching it is the result

1276.08 --> 1282.96
of every experiment that relates

1279.28 --> 1285.28
to the relative density it's a given

1282.96 --> 1286.48
if the object is less dense than its

1285.28 --> 1288.8799999999999
medium it'll go

1286.48 --> 1289.6
up if it's denser than its medium it'll

1288.88 --> 1292.3200000000002
go down

1289.6 --> 1294.559
it's a naturally given fact

1292.32 --> 1295.6
scientifically provable and repeatable

1294.559 --> 1297.6
by everyone

1295.6 --> 1299.52
if you don't accept that then you're a

1297.6 --> 1301.6
delusional [ __ ]

1299.52 --> 1303.039
because you can actually test that

1301.6 --> 1304.6399999999999
yourself very easily

1303.039 --> 1306.08
you can test it with everything you can

1304.64 --> 1308.88
test it with yourself

1306.08 --> 1309.84
in all kinds of ways if you don't accept

1308.88 --> 1312.4
that

1309.84 --> 1313.28
then you don't want to know how things

1312.4 --> 1319.8400000000001
work

1313.28 --> 1319.84
then you don't care you understand

1329.2 --> 1332.88
oh natural fact it doesn't matter george

1331.28 --> 1334.96
sanford

1332.88 --> 1337.3600000000001
literally whether there is a vacuum or

1334.96 --> 1340.32
not does not matter to the effect

1337.36 --> 1342.3999999999999
it's in any circumstances you can't

1340.32 --> 1343.6
create any circumstances where it

1342.4 --> 1348.799
doesn't happen

1343.6 --> 1351.9189999999999
like that you introduce

1348.799 --> 1355.2
right another force

1351.919 --> 1355.5200000000002
provable measurable force in some other

1355.2 --> 1359.44
way

1355.52 --> 1361.679
then path might evade

1359.44 --> 1363.039
or the acceleration may decrease or

1361.679 --> 1365.039
whatever

1363.039 --> 1366.799
the effect may change when another force

1365.039 --> 1368.24
is introduced well that's accounted for

1366.799 --> 1372.32
in science

1368.24 --> 1373.84
that's why you isolate the phenomena

1372.32 --> 1378.32
which is the relative density

1373.84 --> 1378.32
disequilibrium displacement and force

1383.039 --> 1389.36
yeah it doesn't matter maggot brain it

1386.24 --> 1392.08
does not matter the kilogram is

1389.36 --> 1394.1589999999999
all anchored in relative density in an

1392.08 --> 1395.12
air medium anyway that's what determines

1394.159 --> 1398.5590000000002
his weight

1395.12 --> 1401.36
right and both of them are going to be

1398.559 --> 1402.48
denser than the medium they are in so it

1401.36 --> 1405.52
doesn't matter

1402.48 --> 1408.24
whether it's iron or feathers they're

1405.52 --> 1410.1589999999999
both surrounded by a medium

1408.24 --> 1411.36
it's less dense than them so they will

1410.159 --> 1414.88
go down

1411.36 --> 1416.32
and yeah it's already been accounted for

1414.88 --> 1418.96
with the amount

1416.32 --> 1421.039
that the eventual extracted weight from

1418.96 --> 1422.08
the relative density this equilibrium

1421.039 --> 1425.12
force

1422.08 --> 1427.52
that yeah obstruction within the medium

1425.12 --> 1429.12
right it's still surrounded by the air

1427.52 --> 1432.0
that is subtracted can move

1429.12 --> 1433.9189999999999
downward that's where it's gonna go

1432.0 --> 1434.4
because it is denser than the medium it

1433.919 --> 1436.4
is in

1434.4 --> 1438.799
right and then that translates into

1436.4 --> 1440.0
pressure and the extraction of that

1438.799 --> 1443.84
pressure

1440.0 --> 1446.159
is anchored is set into what we know as

1443.84 --> 1446.1589999999999
weight

1446.72 --> 1459.84
so anything else yeah

1450.0 --> 1462.159
anything else

1459.84 --> 1463.36
yeah you know why that is maggot brain

1462.159 --> 1465.8400000000001
you know what it is

1463.36 --> 1466.7199999999998
wood in the water it's because it's less

1465.84 --> 1469.84
dense

1466.72 --> 1473.2
don't you get it it's less dense

1469.84 --> 1476.0
wood normally right has air

1473.2 --> 1477.279
in it within the fibers it can't get it

1476.0 --> 1482.32
out

1477.279 --> 1485.44
like a liter of water

1482.32 --> 1488.6399999999999
is denser

1485.44 --> 1490.3200000000002
than a liter of wood a block of wood

1488.64 --> 1493.8400000000001
that would be a liter

1490.32 --> 1495.76
on average right unless it's like super

1493.84 --> 1498.08
compacted like it's super compacted

1495.76 --> 1501.279
hardwood like australian hardwood

1498.08 --> 1503.039
that might actually sink

1501.279 --> 1505.12
because there is no air in there the

1503.039 --> 1506.0
fibers are so compacted there is no air

1505.12 --> 1507.76
in there

1506.0 --> 1510.799
and it's going to be denser than the

1507.76 --> 1515.84
water so that pro will probably sink

1510.799 --> 1515.84
you understand

1530.799 --> 1537.44
that's the point the liter comparison

1534.4 --> 1540.0800000000002
is to establish the relative

1537.44 --> 1542.0
density of the liter of the medium

1540.08 --> 1544.96
versus a liter of the object which

1542.0 --> 1546.64
is going to be heavier it's an

1544.96 --> 1549.679
extraction from that

1546.64 --> 1552.72
right that way you can determine

1549.679 --> 1554.64
which material is more dense the object

1552.72 --> 1557.919
or the medium that's why i said it

1554.64 --> 1561.44
lol see ya goodbye

1557.919 --> 1563.1200000000001
goodbye chicken quack quack

1561.44 --> 1565.2
yeah yeah you didn't get to make your

1563.12 --> 1567.84
point you lost in every

1565.2 --> 1569.6000000000001
thing you said every remark every

1567.84 --> 1571.1999999999998
suggestion

1569.6 --> 1573.6
first you didn't get it then you tried

1571.2 --> 1575.919
to test it we undid your test

1573.6 --> 1576.8799999999999
by proving exactly what it is explaining

1575.919 --> 1585.8400000000001
every route

1576.88 --> 1585.8400000000001
so you're wrong see ya bye

1591.2 --> 1594.32
right yes topic traffic camera rest

1592.88 --> 1597.679
ahead totally

1594.32 --> 1601.2
and besides huge ships right

1597.679 --> 1604.3200000000002
including steel ones why do they float

1601.2 --> 1604.32
well it's because

1605.279 --> 1608.96
they are effectively surrounded by the

1607.279 --> 1612.48
water

1608.96 --> 1614.96
and the boat is actually hollow

1612.48 --> 1617.279
right so there's air so you take the

1614.96 --> 1621.039
entire ship

1617.279 --> 1623.36
right with

1621.039 --> 1625.36
with what is in it which is air is going

1623.36 --> 1627.76
to be air and objects and things

1625.36 --> 1628.799
then you take that average density of

1627.76 --> 1630.64
the air

1628.799 --> 1631.84
and everything that is the shift the

1630.64 --> 1634.72
entire volume of

1631.84 --> 1636.32
it you take the average density of that

1634.72 --> 1639.039
well guess what

1636.32 --> 1641.6789999999999
it's gonna be slightly less dense than

1639.039 --> 1644.32
the water and that's why it keeps afloat

1641.679 --> 1646.72
because if with the air combined it

1644.32 --> 1650.8799999999999
wasn't less dense

1646.72 --> 1655.84
than the water it would sink a

1650.88 --> 1655.8400000000001
that's how it works

1670.48 --> 1673.76
yeah now he had to run because there was

1672.64 --> 1675.919
literally

1673.76 --> 1676.799
nothing he could even think of any

1675.919 --> 1680.88
further to

1676.799 --> 1683.2
try and stop me to try and make me slip

1680.88 --> 1685.7600000000002
up make me make a mistake

1683.2 --> 1687.2
in explaining how it works exactly it's

1685.76 --> 1691.12
not gonna happen

1687.2 --> 1693.76
because i've mastered this i'm a master

1691.12 --> 1694.799
of relative density theory i can explain

1693.76 --> 1698.279
everything

1694.799 --> 1701.279
every conceivable thing about it every

1698.279 --> 1703.44
conceivable thing

1701.279 --> 1705.2
all right and i'm pretty sure if some

1703.44 --> 1707.8400000000001
new unique elements arrive

1705.2 --> 1708.88
somehow in the future i will be able to

1707.84 --> 1710.799
explain that

1708.88 --> 1713.279
in relation to the relative density

1710.799 --> 1715.279
theory as well

1713.279 --> 1716.559
so yeah anyone can test me on this

1715.279 --> 1719.279
anyone

1716.559 --> 1720.799
any person in the world any person in

1719.279 --> 1724.48
any university

1720.799 --> 1727.12
any teacher any philosopher

1724.48 --> 1727.1200000000001
it's all good

1727.919 --> 1734.5590000000002
easy there are win no not easy

1731.36 --> 1737.039
it's just it's just what it is

1734.559 --> 1739.1299999999999
it's called confidence and knowing your

1737.039 --> 1742.209
skills

1739.13 --> 1742.209
[Music]

1744.159 --> 1750.48
talking about ice i made a drawing

1747.2 --> 1753.679
guys i had a dream

1750.48 --> 1756.88
when i was still awake literally

1753.679 --> 1759.919
like an image just

1756.88 --> 1761.5200000000002
showed itself to me it's weird maybe the

1759.919 --> 1763.44
freaking movie did that

1761.52 --> 1764.8799999999999
there was a lot of like dreaming going

1763.44 --> 1767.52
on in there

1764.88 --> 1769.5200000000002
in an indirect way but i'm gonna share

1767.52 --> 1771.52
that picture

1769.52 --> 1773.44
all right it's a sketch by the way it's

1771.52 --> 1777.279
it could be better

1773.44 --> 1779.44
a lot better i think but i i just

1777.279 --> 1781.52
i envisioned something something i

1779.44 --> 1784.159
usually don't do a lot

1781.52 --> 1787.2
because i'm not much of a barrier guy

1784.159 --> 1790.88
when it comes to cosmogeny

1787.2 --> 1794.0800000000002
but i basically imagine what

1790.88 --> 1798.0800000000002
would it be like

1794.08 --> 1801.279
on i need to what would it be like

1798.08 --> 1803.84
if you would go to south pole north pole

1801.279 --> 1808.799
who knows

1803.84 --> 1812.48
hold on

1808.799 --> 1812.96
and when you got there you would find a

1812.48 --> 1815.6
way

1812.96 --> 1817.3600000000001
through the ice wall because there are

1815.6 --> 1818.559
probably places where you could go

1817.36 --> 1821.52
through

1818.559 --> 1823.2
depending on the time and all that where

1821.52 --> 1825.84
there would be an opening

1823.2 --> 1829.1200000000001
and then at some point what would happen

1825.84 --> 1832.48
if you would literally bump into the

1829.12 --> 1834.9599999999998
unprotected barrier and the a part that

1832.48 --> 1837.76
is not covered by ice

1834.96 --> 1838.96
you could literally bump into the dome

1837.76 --> 1841.84
some kind of barrier

1838.96 --> 1842.559
right what would it be like and then i

1841.84 --> 1851.84
thought

1842.559 --> 1854.96
yes this is what it would be like

1851.84 --> 1856.9599999999998
like this is my view of it at night

1854.96 --> 1858.159
this is what i think would happen you

1856.96 --> 1861.679
could literally see

1858.159 --> 1864.64
nothing beyond the dome it would be

1861.679 --> 1866.64
like all black out there black or

1864.64 --> 1868.88
shadowy some average color

1866.64 --> 1869.919
during the day it would all hew up it

1868.88 --> 1872.5590000000002
would all blew up

1869.919 --> 1875.3600000000001
including right next to the edge it

1872.559 --> 1877.44
would blew up like the day

1875.36 --> 1878.9599999999998
there's no reflection coming off it i

1877.44 --> 1882.0800000000002
think it's literally like a

1878.96 --> 1883.039
an entire hologram background thing and

1882.08 --> 1884.72
i think that

1883.039 --> 1887.2
if there was the moon in the stars at

1884.72 --> 1890.3990000000001
night you would see it all

1887.2 --> 1893.519
just fine basically here the edge

1890.399 --> 1896.9599999999998
of the pressed against the

1893.519 --> 1899.36
the barrier right here this this is

1896.96 --> 1901.44
where it all touches the barrier

1899.36 --> 1903.12
and you would just see it right behind

1901.44 --> 1905.6000000000001
it and you would look around the corner

1903.12 --> 1908.2399999999998
and still see more stars

1905.6 --> 1908.24
over there

1908.96 --> 1914.799
and then here underneath

1912.0 --> 1916.0
the effective horizon which would be at

1914.799 --> 1921.679
eye height

1916.0 --> 1924.0
you would not see stars technically

1921.679 --> 1924.799
just imagine the moon would be going

1924.0 --> 1926.48
under

1924.799 --> 1929.9189999999999
if it would be going under it would

1926.48 --> 1932.159
probably get cut off

1929.919 --> 1934.159
by nothing because there is no thing

1932.159 --> 1934.88
here there's there will be all daylight

1934.159 --> 1937.919
and [ __ ]

1934.88 --> 1940.64
but it will probably cut off

1937.919 --> 1942.3200000000002
now the alternative to that which is

1940.64 --> 1943.039
very surreal i don't think it would work

1942.32 --> 1945.519
that way

1943.039 --> 1948.1589999999999
is that it wouldn't be cut off by a yeah

1945.519 --> 1949.76
a virtual horizon within the nothing but

1948.159 --> 1951.679
it would actually go up and you might

1949.76 --> 1955.44
even be able to look over the

1951.679 --> 1958.5590000000002
edge like through the dome downward

1955.44 --> 1960.799
you would see the water here sitting

1958.559 --> 1960.799
there

1960.88 --> 1964.159
and then you might even be able to see

1962.399 --> 1965.84
it through the water

1964.159 --> 1968.159
that you could see downward and the

1965.84 --> 1970.799
globe of the heaven stars

1968.159 --> 1971.44
might actually be visible down there as

1970.799 --> 1973.9189999999999
well

1971.44 --> 1974.799
but that would be a unique right next to

1973.919 --> 1977.519
the dome

1974.799 --> 1978.24
visual event if that were the case but

1977.519 --> 1980.24
it might

1978.24 --> 1981.679
it's probably more likely that it would

1980.24 --> 1983.6
be cut off

1981.679 --> 1985.1200000000001
in a virtual horizon and that no

1983.6 --> 1987.84
heavenly body would be able to go

1985.12 --> 1987.84
underneath that

1987.919 --> 1991.519
yeah that's something that literally i

1990.559 --> 1994.24
saw that

1991.519 --> 1995.919
in kind of like a waking vision in the

1994.24 --> 1997.919
waking dream

1995.919 --> 2000.24
and i remembered it and drew it out this

1997.919 --> 2000.24
morning

2002.72 --> 2019.84
right hope you guys appreciate that

2022.72 --> 2029.2
no i don't watch logan paul

2026.159 --> 2029.2
guy's disgusting

2031.519 --> 2038.08
why would anyone want to watch that

2035.12 --> 2038.08
it's for garbage

2040.66 --> 2043.8290000000002
[Music]

2044.48 --> 2049.679
relative density allows nothing above

2047.679 --> 2052.56
the hydrogen layer

2049.679 --> 2055.04
well not technically not completely

2052.56 --> 2055.04
correct

2055.359 --> 2058.639
because it's a dynamic system so there's

2057.919 --> 2060.56
no

2058.639 --> 2062.96
perfect stillness anywhere and there

2060.56 --> 2065.52
shouldn't be perfect stillness even at

2062.96 --> 2069.2
the top layers

2065.52 --> 2071.44
that next to the barrier whatever it may

2069.2 --> 2071.4399999999996
be

2073.44 --> 2080.8
but yeah that nothing will move

2077.599 --> 2083.44
no gas will naturally move beyond

2080.8 --> 2085.04
it because there's simply nothing

2083.44 --> 2086.96
through relative density because there's

2085.04 --> 2090.399
nothing less dense than it

2086.96 --> 2092.56
so in that sense yes

2090.399 --> 2094.7999999999997
but it doesn't mean that another force

2092.56 --> 2097.359
cannot potentially in some way

2094.8 --> 2098.4
cause something that is less dense an

2097.359 --> 2101.44
object

2098.4 --> 2104.64
to move beyond it but yet still gonna

2101.44 --> 2104.64
have to deal with the barrier

2105.359 --> 2110.24
eventually if it would make it through

2107.68 --> 2110.24
that very

2110.88 --> 2117.839
that very little dense layer

2144.88 --> 2150.079
once aurelium runs out there there is no

2147.599 --> 2152.48
reason for it to move up yeah it is

2150.079 --> 2154.079
because it it naturally will still

2152.48 --> 2156.2400000000002
expand in all directions

2154.079 --> 2159.8390000000004
it will mix in that's what that's what

2156.24 --> 2159.839
all gases do

2162.8 --> 2169.44
so there there is it's still going to

2166.24 --> 2171.2
move up and hit the barrier

2169.44 --> 2173.2000000000003
and then come down again it does that

2171.2 --> 2176.16
all the time

2173.2 --> 2177.2
you see because air doesn't stand still

2176.16 --> 2178.96
really

2177.2 --> 2180.8799999999997
like there may be no pressure

2178.96 --> 2183.76
differentials in the sense that there is

2180.88 --> 2183.76
wind going

2184.079 --> 2188.2400000000002
because that tends to happen more when

2186.8 --> 2190.1600000000003
the pressure is higher

2188.24 --> 2192.24
at ground level where there is literal

2190.16 --> 2194.56
heat introduced causing

2192.24 --> 2195.5989999999997
the the yeah that change in pressure

2194.56 --> 2197.92
locally

2195.599 --> 2199.2000000000003
that doesn't happen up there as much but

2197.92 --> 2201.92
it doesn't mean that the at

2199.2 --> 2204.0789999999997
the air whatever it may be hydrogen is

2201.92 --> 2206.8
not just still going to

2204.079 --> 2215.8390000000004
mix around with everything else

2206.8 --> 2215.8390000000004
including hitting the container

2220.64 --> 2223.92
the container barrier

2224.88 --> 2229.6800000000003
whatever it may be whether it's the

2227.44 --> 2233.52
bottom of the earth

2229.68 --> 2233.52
simply the end of space

2234.56 --> 2243.02
or potentially some physical thing

2238.32 --> 2244.56
or whatever it may be

2243.02 --> 2247.839
[Music]

2244.56 --> 2249.7599999999998
there is a finite amount of gas and it's

2247.839 --> 2252.96
moving down

2249.76 --> 2255.44
what no

2252.96 --> 2257.76
it's moving in all directions it will

2255.44 --> 2260.2400000000002
hit the container no matter how thin the

2257.76 --> 2260.2400000000002
air is

2263.119 --> 2266.2400000000002
you understand when there is gas

2264.72 --> 2268.0
pressure that gas

2266.24 --> 2269.68
no matter how thin no matter the

2268.0 --> 2272.72
gradient

2269.68 --> 2275.9199999999996
the gas will always be

2272.72 --> 2279.04
at all times pushing hitting

2275.92 --> 2279.76
the container whatever it may be at all

2279.04 --> 2281.92
times

2279.76 --> 2283.599
never stops there's no point at which

2281.92 --> 2286.16
the gas will not be hitting the

2283.599 --> 2286.1600000000003
container

2289.92 --> 2294.48
anyway any comments on my drawing

2292.72 --> 2299.359
conception

2294.48 --> 2302.48
i'll show it again

2299.359 --> 2313.839
because i'm not getting any feedback

2302.48 --> 2313.839
and i do want it

2314.079 --> 2322.079
ah jonathan speculative ideas

2317.68 --> 2325.2
well i think that stars are not objects

2322.079 --> 2327.8390000000004
and they're not spatially local

2325.2 --> 2328.56
lights they're not they're not even just

2327.839 --> 2331.839
points of light

2328.56 --> 2333.7599999999998
emanating from a specific location

2331.839 --> 2336.0789999999997
i think that all the heavenly bodies are

2333.76 --> 2339.3590000000004
a holographic natured

2336.079 --> 2343.92
light manifest light

2339.359 --> 2346.16
that just it arrives in the realm

2343.92 --> 2348.2400000000002
at a very specific angular relation

2346.16 --> 2351.52
probably due to

2348.24 --> 2354.7999999999997
some kind of electrical effect some it's

2351.52 --> 2355.599
yeah electrics the electrics in the

2354.8 --> 2359.44
realm

2355.599 --> 2361.3590000000004
basically must be feeding

2359.44 --> 2362.56
the light manifestation because light

2361.359 --> 2365.119
doesn't just come

2362.56 --> 2365.92
out of nothing because it has to be

2365.119 --> 2368.88
generated

2365.92 --> 2370.2400000000002
somehow naturally has to manifest

2368.88 --> 2372.7200000000003
naturally somehow

2370.24 --> 2373.359
so it's probably electric and it's

2372.72 --> 2375.2
literally

2373.359 --> 2376.4
light manifest it's not coming from a

2375.2 --> 2378.3999999999996
specific point

2376.4 --> 2380.0
that lights up sends the light then

2378.4 --> 2382.0
inverse squared law

2380.0 --> 2384.48
and it's going to reach something out

2382.0 --> 2387.92
there that's not the case

2384.48 --> 2390.2400000000002
it's more like it's just manifesting

2387.92 --> 2391.52
i have a picture for that too by the way

2390.24 --> 2397.839
see

2391.52 --> 2397.839
i'm showing pictures uh

2399.68 --> 2411.839
where is it

2414.04 --> 2417.199
[Music]

2423.52 --> 2431.359
oh it should be this one

2426.72 --> 2431.359
yeah oh great

2432.24 --> 2436.0
okay let's see if this yeah it worked

2436.839 --> 2441.68
cool

2438.8 --> 2443.44
right so light manifest here to the

2441.68 --> 2447.359
right in this picture

2443.44 --> 2450.16
you see what if the sunlight

2447.359 --> 2451.52
is coming from a ball in a sp yeah an

2450.16 --> 2455.5989999999997
especially

2451.52 --> 2458.88
literal location this is what it

2455.599 --> 2462.0
technically would be like on the left

2458.88 --> 2464.319
so what i think how it really works it's

2462.0 --> 2467.76
location bound

2464.319 --> 2471.04
probably electrically fed light

2467.76 --> 2474.079
manifest and the stronger

2471.04 --> 2477.599
yeah the closer down to earth you are

2474.079 --> 2479.119
the stronger it gets so there it may be

2477.599 --> 2481.28
some correlating effect with the

2479.119 --> 2484.6400000000003
atmosphere actually helping it to

2481.28 --> 2487.92
manifest more strongly

2484.64 --> 2490.56
because if you go up there it's already

2487.92 --> 2492.319
been science indications that it just it

2490.56 --> 2496.0
grows less it grows

2492.319 --> 2497.68
angular wise smaller and most of it may

2496.0 --> 2500.56
even just

2497.68 --> 2500.56
just disappear

2501.119 --> 2505.2000000000003
like stars tend to disappear when you go

2504.319 --> 2508.319
up that's

2505.2 --> 2509.2
that's what i gathered so far no

2508.319 --> 2511.44
definitive

2509.2 --> 2513.04
conclusion about that just yet but it's

2511.44 --> 2516.8
it's like an indication it's

2513.04 --> 2516.8
a yeah a sign

2517.2 --> 2521.68
that i drew into this conception which

2519.28 --> 2525.52
is very difficult one

2521.68 --> 2528.2
this is very very out there to suggest

2525.52 --> 2530.4
to people that like may be coming from a

2528.2 --> 2533.2799999999997
non-physical

2530.4 --> 2536.079
thing it's not coming from a physical

2533.28 --> 2538.6400000000003
thing like it's a rainbow

2536.079 --> 2539.8390000000004
because yeah how can you compare that to

2538.64 --> 2542.96
anything that you

2539.839 --> 2545.119
can be assured to is a light

2542.96 --> 2547.119
well with a physical object so anything

2545.119 --> 2548.6400000000003
you're going to physically man-made try

2547.119 --> 2549.92
to emulate with it yeah it's always

2548.64 --> 2550.96
going to come from an object because

2549.92 --> 2553.92
that's the only way

2550.96 --> 2555.92
that we can create light it's coming

2553.92 --> 2558.0
from objects

2555.92 --> 2559.359
from specific locations that's how we

2558.0 --> 2562.0
know to do it

2559.359 --> 2564.24
well i don't think that this the

2562.0 --> 2566.48
heavenly light the celestial light falls

2564.24 --> 2567.5989999999997
into that category and i think that all

2566.48 --> 2569.68
humanity

2567.599 --> 2572.2400000000002
is very much burdened by physicality

2569.68 --> 2575.9199999999996
assumption bias

2572.24 --> 2579.4399999999996
causes us to not be able to accept

2575.92 --> 2593.839
such a conception as i've tried to

2579.44 --> 2593.839
work out

2599.28 --> 2603.599
left and right of the pick why is it

2601.359 --> 2607.839
blank it's because there's ice there

2603.599 --> 2610.319
that's where the ice wall ends

2607.839 --> 2611.68
like if there's a passage through then

2610.319 --> 2614.4
there might be

2611.68 --> 2615.9199999999996
some way into another realm who knows

2614.4 --> 2619.2000000000003
but it also might be

2615.92 --> 2620.7200000000003
that you'll simply like oh you can't get

2619.2 --> 2623.2
any further because here

2620.72 --> 2624.72
is the barrier there's the end of the

2623.2 --> 2626.3999999999996
space

2624.72 --> 2628.64
and then the water will just be sitting

2626.4 --> 2631.2000000000003
against it and the ice

2628.64 --> 2632.24
will be stuck against it that's what it

2631.2 --> 2634.48
was

2632.24 --> 2635.4399999999996
supposed to represent sorry about that

2634.48 --> 2649.839
it's just a

2635.44 --> 2649.839
pencil sketch so

2651.92 --> 2655.6800000000003
uh 2015 fantasized stars are whole in

2654.64 --> 2658.4
the firmament

2655.68 --> 2660.0789999999997
yeah well the imagination will grow wild

2658.4 --> 2662.4
on something that is not

2660.079 --> 2663.92
literally a physical object and that

2662.4 --> 2667.04
barrier for our

2663.92 --> 2668.0
minds to overcome when you don't

2667.04 --> 2669.68
overcome it

2668.0 --> 2671.68
then this is what happens the

2669.68 --> 2675.1189999999997
imagination tries to make

2671.68 --> 2677.5989999999997
something out of it and that will

2675.119 --> 2679.2000000000003
grow go into fantastical regions because

2677.599 --> 2680.88
you don't know where else to go this is

2679.2 --> 2683.359
what children do too

2680.88 --> 2684.6400000000003
when they have even less oversight over

2683.359 --> 2686.48
how things work

2684.64 --> 2688.0789999999997
they just try to figure it out and they

2686.48 --> 2690.0
will use their fantasy

2688.079 --> 2691.2000000000003
to try to construct something that seems

2690.0 --> 2694.72
logical to them

2691.2 --> 2694.72
so this is only natural

2696.48 --> 2701.119
like the more complex more

2699.28 --> 2704.8
psychologically difficult

2701.119 --> 2709.119
something is to understand the more

2704.8 --> 2712.079
people will have a tendency to then

2709.119 --> 2715.04
use their fantasy to just imagine

2712.079 --> 2719.119
something amazing about it

2715.04 --> 2721.599
that's very normal that people do that

2719.119 --> 2722.6400000000003
people do just look at freaking quantum

2721.599 --> 2726.0
mechanics

2722.64 --> 2728.48
like technically quantum mechanics

2726.0 --> 2730.24
like the core essence of it it's

2728.48 --> 2733.52
actually kind of simple

2730.24 --> 2736.56
it's simplistic but

2733.52 --> 2740.0
because of just

2736.56 --> 2742.64
the nature of it and what it does

2740.0 --> 2744.56
that's the part that people like get

2742.64 --> 2747.52
they just don't get it i

2744.56 --> 2749.68
can barely get a grip on it fully i can

2747.52 --> 2750.64
get a grip on it enough to figure things

2749.68 --> 2753.359
out about it and

2750.64 --> 2754.8799999999997
there might be things wrong with it that

2753.359 --> 2758.48
i've specified

2754.88 --> 2758.48
but most people will just

2758.96 --> 2766.96
micro that's that to them so then

2763.76 --> 2769.2000000000003
it becomes very prone to fantastical

2766.96 --> 2771.599
imaginations and even science fiction

2769.2 --> 2772.319
it's very easy to just say oh this is a

2771.599 --> 2774.6400000000003
quantum

2772.319 --> 2775.599
thing then it's like oh it's super duper

2774.64 --> 2777.359
special

2775.599 --> 2778.7200000000003
that's what it will be like to people

2777.359 --> 2781.5989999999997
they don't understand what the [ __ ]

2778.72 --> 2784.64
quantum mechanics is or quantum anything

2781.599 --> 2786.48
see so it becomes easier to just call

2784.64 --> 2789.359
something quantum and then it's like oh

2786.48 --> 2792.079
that sounds really sci-fi

2789.359 --> 2793.2799999999997
that's how it works on most people and

2792.079 --> 2795.76
then people that actually

2793.28 --> 2796.88
do get it are like oh god here we go

2795.76 --> 2800.3190000000004
again

2796.88 --> 2803.839
stamping something quantum obviously it

2800.319 --> 2803.839
won't have anything to do with it

2812.319 --> 2817.04
mirror water like what are you talking

2815.839 --> 2831.839
about

2817.04 --> 2831.839
george sanford

2834.56 --> 2838.72
do we need to show the picture again i

2836.4 --> 2845.44
will

2838.72 --> 2859.839
oh no that's not the one

2845.44 --> 2859.839
you put it in the right spot too

2862.559 --> 2873.8390000000004
all right

2879.19 --> 2882.32
[Music]

2888.16 --> 2894.24
moon as a reflection of earth no

2891.359 --> 2895.52
yeah i've heard that i absolutely swipe

2894.24 --> 2897.5989999999997
that off the table

2895.52 --> 2898.72
there's no freaking correlation

2897.599 --> 2900.559
whatsoever

2898.72 --> 2902.5589999999997
if it's supposed to be a reflection then

2900.559 --> 2905.8390000000004
it's like the most crooked warp

2902.559 --> 2907.8390000000004
mirror reflection that i've ever seen

2905.839 --> 2910.5589999999997
because it doesn't correlate it doesn't

2907.839 --> 2913.52
correlate at all

2910.559 --> 2914.4
it's like literally trying to see things

2913.52 --> 2916.88
in clouds

2914.4 --> 2918.0
when you do that so i'm not going with

2916.88 --> 2929.839
that concept

2918.0 --> 2929.839
at all george sanford

2943.68 --> 2948.3999999999996
letting god's light through well

2945.68 --> 2948.3999999999996
jonathan

2949.92 --> 2956.4
yeah i have a concept that is just not

2953.28 --> 2958.1600000000003
physically provable just yet

2956.4 --> 2959.52
anyway i don't know how i would don't

2958.16 --> 2961.2799999999997
even know where to start

2959.52 --> 2962.96
but i've imagined that basically the

2961.28 --> 2965.2000000000003
heavenly lights are

2962.96 --> 2966.16
well if they're light manifest then

2965.2 --> 2970.319
maybe they are

2966.16 --> 2972.64
fourth dimensionally

2970.319 --> 2974.079
yeah maybe in the fourth dimension they

2972.64 --> 2978.4
are literal

2974.079 --> 2981.28
lights coming in literal locations

2978.4 --> 2982.319
going around in a circle over a literal

2981.28 --> 2983.76
disk

2982.319 --> 2985.92
but that would be in the fourth

2983.76 --> 2989.44
dimension

2985.92 --> 2992.079
because in the third dimension it seems

2989.44 --> 2993.839
like they are just like that everywhere

2992.079 --> 2996.96
no matter what see that

2993.839 --> 2998.0789999999997
that was for me like a first at least

2996.96 --> 3001.44
the realistic

2998.079 --> 3002.559
seeming seemed more realistic to see it

3001.44 --> 3004.48
that way

3002.559 --> 3005.92
that it is actually a projection from

3004.48 --> 3008.559
the fourth dimension

3005.92 --> 3009.6800000000003
which is literally here it's just

3008.559 --> 3012.4
through

3009.68 --> 3014.64
we can't get there but it will reach us

3012.4 --> 3018.8
here in the third dimension

3014.64 --> 3021.7599999999998
as we see it as a celestial sphere

3018.8 --> 3022.559
that surround us at all times and never

3021.76 --> 3024.8390000000004
changes

3022.559 --> 3027.6800000000003
apparent location even if we change

3024.839 --> 3029.92
location

3027.68 --> 3029.9199999999996
see

3033.119 --> 3036.319
it doesn't have any impact on the earth

3035.44 --> 3039.359
not

3036.319 --> 3042.96
not any force like impact

3039.359 --> 3044.319
it's just that the i don't know the

3042.96 --> 3046.079
light frequency

3044.319 --> 3047.52
does seem to have an influence but

3046.079 --> 3050.8
that's not like a more

3047.52 --> 3052.96
that's not really a physical

3050.8 --> 3054.079
mass relating influence not a force

3052.96 --> 3056.7200000000003
influence of any

3054.079 --> 3058.88
sort it's rather yeah you say the

3056.72 --> 3060.24
categorized the astrological influence

3058.88 --> 3062.96
which is more

3060.24 --> 3063.7599999999998
the subtle energies spirit influence the

3062.96 --> 3069.839
energy that

3063.76 --> 3073.28
our spirit is will be influenced by it

3069.839 --> 3077.68
that's how the entire astrological

3073.28 --> 3077.6800000000003
system has been created

3078.48 --> 3082.0
to figure out how people will be

3081.28 --> 3085.52
influenced

3082.0 --> 3088.16
by it and then yeah trying to do

3085.52 --> 3088.16
something with that

3090.64 --> 3094.5589999999997
but other than that influence there is

3092.48 --> 3096.96
no influence of it

3094.559 --> 3098.079
there's no tides being caused by the

3096.96 --> 3100.64
moon

3098.079 --> 3101.6800000000003
because that doesn't match in the

3100.64 --> 3105.359
slightest

3101.68 --> 3107.359
any conception to to try to imagine that

3105.359 --> 3111.2799999999997
the moon causes a tide

3107.359 --> 3113.52
is completely off like any

3111.28 --> 3114.96
any child can just look at the data and

3113.52 --> 3116.88
know yeah

3114.96 --> 3118.8
there's just no indication that anything

3116.88 --> 3122.8
has to do with it other than you

3118.8 --> 3125.76
just imagining that the moon moving

3122.8 --> 3127.599
past is gonna call separate spots to

3125.76 --> 3130.079
just start stirring around

3127.599 --> 3131.599
at certain intervals that don't even

3130.079 --> 3133.8390000000004
directly correlate

3131.599 --> 3135.599
with the moment the moon is supposed to

3133.839 --> 3138.96
be passing by

3135.599 --> 3141.3590000000004
makes no freaking sense whatsoever

3138.96 --> 3142.079
also you can't even calculate how

3141.359 --> 3144.4
gravity

3142.079 --> 3145.44
is supposed to influence the water on

3144.4 --> 3148.0
earth

3145.44 --> 3148.7200000000003
because einstein's field equations don't

3148.0 --> 3151.76
allow

3148.72 --> 3153.9199999999996
for more than one source of gravity

3151.76 --> 3155.0400000000004
so you can't even calculate how it's

3153.92 --> 3167.839
supposed to work

3155.04 --> 3167.839
how about that

3179.28 --> 3181.599
ah

3186.72 --> 3190.319
dark light period for the cannabis

3188.72 --> 3192.5589999999997
flowed well

3190.319 --> 3195.839
i don't know i think that the moon does

3192.559 --> 3195.8390000000004
have some influence

3198.88 --> 3202.88
but it's not the same type of in there's

3201.52 --> 3205.119
like different

3202.88 --> 3207.599
types of light coming from the moon as

3205.119 --> 3210.0
from the sun which is also by the way

3207.599 --> 3211.2000000000003
pretty damn good proof that yeah the

3210.0 --> 3213.359
moonlight is not

3211.2 --> 3214.96
a reflection from the sun because it's a

3213.359 --> 3215.5989999999997
whole different type of light that's

3214.96 --> 3219.52
coming from

3215.599 --> 3222.96
it from it and you you can't prove

3219.52 --> 3224.079
there's no material that exists that we

3222.96 --> 3226.48
in any libert

3224.079 --> 3227.3590000000004
laboratory or vacuum situation that we

3226.48 --> 3231.52
can create

3227.359 --> 3233.839
that will literally reflect sunlight

3231.52 --> 3234.559
that will literally then become as

3233.839 --> 3237.7599999999998
moonlight

3234.559 --> 3238.4
there's nothing nothing out there that

3237.76 --> 3242.4
does that

3238.4 --> 3242.4
i've never heard of it if if there is

3242.8 --> 3247.2000000000003
so it just doesn't work and hey the

3245.52 --> 3247.92
moon's supposed to be made out of rock

3247.2 --> 3250.24
and sand

3247.92 --> 3251.92
well let's just see if rock and sand can

3250.24 --> 3253.04
reflect sunlight and then create a

3251.92 --> 3256.4
moonlight right

3253.04 --> 3257.52
no no it can't doesn't matter in what

3256.4 --> 3259.599
type of

3257.52 --> 3262.839
vacuum chamber you put it with any type

3259.599 --> 3265.839
of gas that's just never gonna happen

3262.839 --> 3265.839
period

3278.799 --> 3283.52
the petrified wood the moon rock you

3281.28 --> 3283.52
mean

3308.559 --> 3312.4
so how are the tides predicted it's very

3311.119 --> 3315.44
simple there's a

3312.4 --> 3318.799
cyclical nature to it

3315.44 --> 3320.319
separate from the heavenly bodies

3318.799 --> 3322.799
but yeah they can definitely be

3320.319 --> 3325.52
determined to

3322.799 --> 3326.4
be more emphasized in very specific

3325.52 --> 3329.04
regions

3326.4 --> 3329.839
than have certain types of material

3329.04 --> 3333.04
metals

3329.839 --> 3336.4
in the ground more than other regions

3333.04 --> 3339.7599999999998
that's where the tides become the most

3336.4 --> 3344.559
emphasized and

3339.76 --> 3348.48
yeah just studying how the tides work

3344.559 --> 3350.4
one can only conclude by comparing

3348.48 --> 3353.28
everything to everything that it is

3350.4 --> 3355.839
magnetically influenced somehow

3353.28 --> 3356.96
there has to be a magnetic or electrical

3355.839 --> 3360.16
thing happening

3356.96 --> 3361.28
and who was it was it adam meekin or was

3360.16 --> 3363.04
it

3361.28 --> 3364.48
somebody i didn't i don't remember where

3363.04 --> 3368.5589999999997
i heard it

3364.48 --> 3368.559
was explaining that

3368.72 --> 3372.0789999999997
like the electrical

3372.24 --> 3377.7599999999998
the magnetic or electrical current that

3375.28 --> 3380.48
just happens

3377.76 --> 3381.599
god i forgot how it worked but basically

3380.48 --> 3384.64
if you have

3381.599 --> 3386.559
salt water that

3384.64 --> 3388.319
when you let electricity through it it's

3386.559 --> 3390.2400000000002
not like magnetically viable it's not

3388.319 --> 3392.16
going to be changed by magnetics but

3390.24 --> 3394.5589999999997
if there is electricity going through it

3392.16 --> 3397.7599999999998
then it starts to behave

3394.559 --> 3401.599
it starts to displace starts to change

3397.76 --> 3403.28
so it is very likely that the tides are

3401.599 --> 3407.839
caused by a direct

3403.28 --> 3411.2000000000003
natural electric effect that is cyclical

3407.839 --> 3414.72
and that electrical effect is probably

3411.2 --> 3418.16
of the same source that again causes the

3414.72 --> 3421.04
heavenly body manifestation

3418.16 --> 3421.5989999999997
it's like earth electricity it's

3421.04 --> 3423.92
happening

3421.599 --> 3432.2400000000002
in the realm it's just there and it

3423.92 --> 3437.44
causes these things to happen

3432.24 --> 3437.4399999999996
yeah it is a lie yeah it is

3438.72 --> 3447.839
tiny one more that's all lies

3450.88 --> 3455.359
yeah just because you can predict things

3453.76 --> 3461.8390000000004
happening doesn't mean that it's

3455.359 --> 3461.839
freaking balls out there

3475.599 --> 3480.48
what tides are predicted like calendar

3478.319 --> 3480.48
year

3486.839 --> 3489.839
what

3490.64 --> 3495.52
pretty sure tides are daily occurrences

3493.28 --> 3495.52
so

3496.559 --> 3500.7200000000003
they happen twice a day or sometimes

3499.2 --> 3503.7599999999998
even three times a day

3500.72 --> 3504.48
in certain locations in some places the

3503.76 --> 3507.6800000000003
tide goes

3504.48 --> 3510.64
really high really low

3507.68 --> 3511.9199999999996
and other places not so high just a tiny

3510.64 --> 3514.64
difference

3511.92 --> 3517.52
so it's it depends on the region on the

3514.64 --> 3520.64
consistency of the materials

3517.52 --> 3522.48
maybe even unlike the distribution weave

3520.64 --> 3524.64
of the electrical

3522.48 --> 3531.839
field that's causing all of this i don't

3524.64 --> 3531.839
know how it works exactly

3542.24 --> 3547.359
right anyway i'm gonna round out the

3543.76 --> 3549.6800000000003
show how time has flown

3547.359 --> 3550.64
i like this show i thought it was good

3549.68 --> 3554.0789999999997
if

3550.64 --> 3556.48
you liked it too then please

3554.079 --> 3558.319

3594.88 --> 3598.839
i'm going to join the flat earth debate

3596.4 --> 3602.4
we has just now started up

3598.839 --> 3605.44
1250 right and

3602.4 --> 3609.04
