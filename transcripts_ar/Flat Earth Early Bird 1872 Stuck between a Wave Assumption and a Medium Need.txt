like there were people literally just

622.36 --> 625.519
spamming complete

625.68 --> 632.4399999999999
nonsense because I don't know one of

632.44 --> 637.5600000000001
of like did you follow the left hand or

635.56 --> 640.279
the right hand path so I was just like

637.56 --> 642.5189999999999
okay why I'm just I should never do that

640.279 --> 644.92
I should never actually address any of

642.519 --> 648.44
those people in those chats cuz they are

644.92 --> 651.12
like severely mentally

648.44 --> 654.5600000000001
deranged like very

651.12 --> 655.92
seriously all kinds of weird compulsive

654.56 --> 659.5189999999999
demonic

655.92 --> 662.079
behaviors and obsessions but I mean like

they just went

662.079 --> 667.16
nuts yeah it is filled with freak

664.44 --> 670.8800000000001
slow-mo and I don't understand like why

667.16 --> 673.4399999999999
codington is just allowing them maybe

670.88 --> 676.079
maybe it's just maybe this is like those

673.44 --> 679.36
fre the set of freaks that is like also

676.079 --> 682.3599999999999
been bothering Owen so

679.36 --> 685.16

out ban him I mean if he'd ban those

700.2 --> 706.1600000000001
[ __ ] freaks there's a good chance

702.839 --> 708.44
that there would be like a lot more

706.16 --> 710.639
actual bears would suddenly pop in the

708.44 --> 712.5600000000001
chat and start talking which like

710.639 --> 715.5600000000001
doesn't happen because literally they're

712.56 --> 716.7199999999999
just like a bunch of bullies just

715.56 --> 720.399
sitting

716.72 --> 722.639

753.199 --> 758.12
of that and Nathan knows that and he

doesn't like

758.12 --> 763.8
it yeah I don't even do anything with my

761.36 --> 766.36
wrench anymore in his chat because of

763.8 --> 766.3599999999999
exactly

768.639 --> 773.519
that Rumble gives them a place to vent

771.36 --> 775.9590000000001
there inside right well is there any

773.519 --> 777.839
better place to go to where there not

775.959 --> 780.1199999999999
where there's a little bit more

777.839 --> 782.399
moderation cuz I'm getting kind of sick

780.12 --> 782.399
of the

784.079 --> 790.519
rumble like I'm sick of it a gentle

790.6 --> 796.24
Bear yeah freaks were out last night

803.04 --> 809.8389999999999
subscriber and that runs out so I can

807.88 --> 810.8
comment there but I mean there's nobody

809.839 --> 815.0
really

810.8 --> 815.0
there there's no real chat

818.079 --> 823.68
happening right so and yeah unauthorized

821.44 --> 828.0790000000001
well that's

823.68 --> 830.3199999999999
gone well I I can't get in there so I

828.079 --> 830.3199999999999
don't

830.519 --> 837.759
know whatever but I mean hey it's

834.399 --> 839.32
uh it's like bacterial

837.759 --> 840.6800000000001
season

839.32 --> 842.399
they're all getting attacked and

840.68 --> 844.68
everybody's getting nasty and the

842.399 --> 846.32
pressure is high up so all the demons

844.68 --> 848.04
all come out and everybody and they just

846.32 --> 851.1990000000001
like looking for

848.04 --> 853.16
targets let's attack attack attack CU

851.199 --> 855.56
they're being attacked and so they just

853.16 --> 858.8389999999999
make everything

855.56 --> 858.8389999999999
worse for

862.44 --> 867.5600000000001
everybody I mean these The ancestral

865.079 --> 870.8389999999999
winds what I'm talking about that I'm

867.56 --> 872.7199999999999
getting bothered by it's not just me and

870.839 --> 875.6
it's kind of weird that it's happening

872.72 --> 875.6
at this

875.88 --> 882.399
period like this is not the

879.199 --> 884.399
regular season type influence that's

882.399 --> 886.68
happening this is not like the the

884.399 --> 889.56
Christmas ancestral winds that are

886.68 --> 892.199
happening this something else like this

889.56 --> 894.0
is just like actual builtup tension

892.199 --> 897.68
there's crazy things going on out there

894.0 --> 900.24
in the world very seriously

897.68 --> 901.959
insane

900.24 --> 904.12
[Music]

901.959 --> 906.3599999999999
like this freaking di missionary

904.12 --> 909.12
government here is just basically just

906.36 --> 911.639
declaring dictatorship and [ __ ] like

909.12 --> 913.399
saying like oh if you don't do this then

911.639 --> 915.399
we can't form a government like if you

913.399 --> 917.32
don't do that thing that absolutely

915.399 --> 919.639
nobody wants and will make everything

917.32 --> 922.6800000000001
worse then we can't have a government

919.639 --> 927.12
like or way or no way I mean this

922.68 --> 927.12
straight out dictatorship that's just

927.6 --> 931.759
here

929.959 --> 935.7589999999999
crazy

931.759 --> 935.759
[ __ ] everybody's feeling a

937.519 --> 942.6
strain right but so am I but despite

940.92 --> 943.4799999999999
that I'm feeling the strain that I'm

942.6 --> 946.88
having

943.48 --> 950.12
issues It's seems like applying the

946.88 --> 951.88
technique actually works better when

950.12 --> 953.759
you're under pressure like that as long

951.88 --> 955.519
as you walk the right path and you don't

953.759 --> 957.24
give up it's very important the not

955.519 --> 960.6
giving up

957.24 --> 960.6
Factor so

961.199 --> 965.68
it's

962.68 --> 970.279
working how dare you it's a demon how

965.68 --> 972.399
dare you use the words Jesus Christ in

970.279 --> 975.92
the technique and call upon the

972.399 --> 978.72
Archangel Michael oh my God it's like

975.92 --> 978.7199999999999
obviously

987.519 --> 990.519
demonic

995.88 --> 999.48
did you watch the Eric Weinstein

997.639 --> 1001.319
interview talk about

999.48 --> 1005.519
yesterday

1001.319 --> 1009.5999999999999

1005.519 --> 1012.839

1009.6 --> 1014.72
was cooking like dinner throughout the

1012.839 --> 1017.1990000000001
show so I missed

1014.72 --> 1019.9590000000001
parts and then when I came back was just

1017.199 --> 1022.38
mostly trolling out there

1019.959 --> 1025.559
so I don't

1022.38 --> 1025.559
[Music]

1029.439 --> 1032.6000000000001
know hey

1038.16 --> 1043.1200000000001

1045.88 --> 1050.3600000000001
fake and Flat Earth again and that

1047.959 --> 1056.6000000000001

1066.799 --> 1074.08
while right I'm so glad to have you guys

whining out there and

1076.039 --> 1083.039
craziness like I got sort of rules and

1079.159 --> 1085.4
hey I'm not even a perfect ruler I get

1083.039 --> 1088.2
kind of nutty myself right I get like

1085.4 --> 1091.6000000000001
over sensitive I get paranoid he's like

1088.2 --> 1093.8400000000001
oh were you secretly oh here here he is

1091.6 --> 1094.84
again [ __ ] off you're not welcome here

1093.84 --> 1100.039
dip

1094.84 --> 1103.76
[ __ ] uh don't call his name right hey

1100.039 --> 1107.32
LSG I wanted to I wanted to ask you

1103.76 --> 1111.559
something it was just a

1107.32 --> 1113.3999999999999
test I was thinking yesterday like why

1111.559 --> 1117.24
why not

1113.4 --> 1120.52
LSG so I tried to apply the technique to

1117.24 --> 1123.6
you and it was around 400

1120.52 --> 1124.9189999999999
p.m. Amsterdam time which is probably in

1123.6 --> 1128.48
the middle of your day and I was

1124.919 --> 1128.48
wondering if you noticed any

1133.48 --> 1140.32
difference cuz I'm very curious about

1136.52 --> 1140.32
the the time of it

1142.52 --> 1147.84
cuz it seems a lot of the time there's

1145.2 --> 1151.1200000000001
like an hour delay before it like

1147.84 --> 1153.36
fully starts to work and all that I was

1151.12 --> 1156.36
wondering if he just felt

1153.36 --> 1159.12
any anything around that

1156.36 --> 1160.9189999999999
time anyway maybe you didn't I don't

1159.12 --> 1164.6399999999999
know I hope you're doing

1160.919 --> 1164.64
great cuz that was the

1167.24 --> 1170.24
intent

1188.919 --> 1193.48
okay maybe you're busy whatever we'll

1191.12 --> 1193.4799999999998
figure it

1194.159 --> 1200.24
out otherwise I'll just ask you in Skype

1197.2 --> 1203.24
or something

1200.24 --> 1203.24
uh

1203.48 --> 1208.679
ah right so it's 4 at night here that's

1206.6 --> 1211.36
probably like in the middle of the

1208.679 --> 1211.3600000000001
afternoon or

1213.72 --> 1217.96
something

1215.4 --> 1221.3600000000001
right so right now

1217.96 --> 1221.3600000000001
it's after

1222.0 --> 1230.159
2

1224.039 --> 1230.1589999999999
so what time is it 14 hours from now

1230.2 --> 1235.679
isn't that

1231.76 --> 1235.679
like 4:00 or

1242.52 --> 1249.0
something the sounds kind of weird but I

1245.039 --> 1249.0
felt that you were like doing

1253.0 --> 1256.0
stuff

1256.32 --> 1260.12
right I look dude if you didn't really

1259.12 --> 1262.0
feel

1260.12 --> 1265.52
anything doesn't

1262.0 --> 1271.36
matter I'm basically just testing it

1265.52 --> 1273.679
out cuz like I I'm not even familiar

1271.36 --> 1276.9599999999998
with really how this works like my

1273.679 --> 1281.0800000000002
healer does this like pretty much like

1276.96 --> 1284.279
all day long and

1281.08 --> 1288.6
it's I mean dealing with this is kind of

1284.279 --> 1291.44
like the scene from Star Wars 5 where

1288.6 --> 1294.08
it's like I can't believe that this

1291.44 --> 1296.48
works and I'm like trying to check out

1294.08 --> 1299.559
like how many times can I do it and does

1296.48 --> 1304.3600000000001
it like drain me or something if I do it

1299.559 --> 1306.96
a lot or just how to do it and when

1304.36 --> 1309.9189999999999
things might go wrong or something on

1306.96 --> 1312.919
with yeah how I mean I'm literally just

1309.919 --> 1315.159
trying I'm just trying to figure it out

1312.919 --> 1315.159
but

1317.039 --> 1320.039
seriously

1328.52 --> 1334.76
and yeah considering like you've been

1331.2 --> 1336.96
through some things in in a not to

1334.76 --> 1339.679
distant past I thought that like yeah

1336.96 --> 1339.679
maybe I could

1344.679 --> 1349.96
like give you some courage or something

1350.44 --> 1355.679
Forte Revitalize anyway that was the

1356.279 --> 1361.44
idea I was eating a pizza and drinking a

1358.96 --> 1361.44
beer

1361.52 --> 1365.1589999999999
oh well how was

1367.96 --> 1373.32
it yeah the beer might be a bit of

1371.36 --> 1376.32
a an

1373.32 --> 1376.32
influencer

1376.96 --> 1379.96
but

1394.36 --> 1398.84
right

1395.32 --> 1398.84
anyway it doesn't

1400.52 --> 1409.8799999999999
matter hey lot

1403.559 --> 1409.8799999999999
wind how is it hanging just fine

1410.08 --> 1417.76
more programming to G got really yeah

1414.08 --> 1417.76
you barely understood it okay that's

1418.32 --> 1423.6399999999999
problematic that's kind of the issues I

1420.48 --> 1427.1200000000001
ran into as well it's just so much of

1423.64 --> 1427.1200000000001
it becomes

1436.64 --> 1439.88
hectic h

1447.72 --> 1452.159
all right El hope you that was

1464.84 --> 1471.32
enjoyable right so anybody War oh my God

1468.84 --> 1474.76
please don't appy the technique to me

1471.32 --> 1476.52
it's demonic don't worry about it like

1474.76 --> 1479.039
the worst that could happen is that just

1476.52 --> 1482.12
nothing happens it's like that it

1479.039 --> 1484.279
doesn't work that I misread the

1482.12 --> 1485.799
communications that basically say like

1484.279 --> 1487.64
no you can't do anything about it and

1485.799 --> 1492.679
then still think I can and then it's

1487.64 --> 1492.679
like basically a misfire nothing really

1493.6 --> 1501.08
happens or a miscast better word there's

1497.0 --> 1503.84
no firing happening so like it's

1501.08 --> 1508.48
literally the most harmless thing in the

1503.84 --> 1512.76
world unless you're [ __ ] evil though

1508.48 --> 1512.76
yeah cuz then you don't like people

1513.48 --> 1518.06
recovering from their spiritual damages

1516.2 --> 1523.159
and all that

1518.06 --> 1525.799
[Music]

1523.159 --> 1529.679
anyway I can't believe he actually

1525.799 --> 1529.679
thought that that's so I

1530.76 --> 1535.8799999999999
like what kind of a Christian are you if

1533.799 --> 1537.96
someone is like doing something and

1535.88 --> 1540.48
using the words Jesus Christ and

1537.96 --> 1544.8400000000001
Archangel Michael and you still think

1540.48 --> 1548.039
it's demonic when they do it like what

1544.84 --> 1549.6
kind of a Christian are you then what

1548.039 --> 1553.24
the

1549.6 --> 1557.1999999999998
[ __ ] I mean isn't it about that about

1553.24 --> 1560.6
that name about invoking that and I'm

1557.2 --> 1560.6000000000001
just baffled by

1564.08 --> 1568.399
[Music]

1565.919 --> 1572.3990000000001
this yeah

1568.399 --> 1575.559
slow-mo I know right but judgmental it's

1572.399 --> 1579.1589999999999
not even judge it's just saying it's

1575.559 --> 1582.08
demonic when you use those words it's

1579.159 --> 1585.159
just if he'd say like what he's doing is

1582.08 --> 1588.6
wrong God will not be appreciative or

1585.159 --> 1591.48
something right then it's like okay fair

1588.6 --> 1593.52
enough according to your logical belief

1591.48 --> 1597.96
structure

1593.52 --> 1601.399
yeah that should be a thing but I mean

1597.96 --> 1602.64
to call it demonic that is this seems

1601.399 --> 1607.12
something like

1602.64 --> 1607.1200000000001
really asinine about that to

1610.72 --> 1613.72
me

1615.159 --> 1621.24
like I don't call

1618.24 --> 1623.32
is Faith

1621.24 --> 1627.0
demonic it's

1623.32 --> 1629.52
just misled by man that's how I kind of

1627.0 --> 1631.84
see it but I mean it still has great

1629.52 --> 1633.44
traits and I know that if you like pray

1631.84 --> 1636.52
to God or Jesus

1633.44 --> 1639.24
Christ like whatever you even might

1636.52 --> 1641.48
incorrectly believe about them it

1639.24 --> 1643.2
doesn't even matter it doesn't matter

1641.48 --> 1646.159
that

1643.2 --> 1648.0800000000002
much it's the imposing it on the the

1646.159 --> 1650.7600000000002
error on others

1648.08 --> 1652.6799999999998
that's really doing the damage so I just

1650.76 --> 1654.799
don't

1652.68 --> 1658.64
[Music]

1654.799 --> 1658.6399999999999
understand what the problem

1660.44 --> 1671.2
is yeah which God is Neil talking about

1665.2 --> 1674.679
dius uh no no that's not funny no I I'm

1671.2 --> 1676.519
not going to go there like he's

1674.679 --> 1680.48
not

1676.519 --> 1682.44
no it's just mistaken yeah people will

1680.48 --> 1685.76
perish for a lack of

1682.44 --> 1685.76
knowledge is

1687.2 --> 1692.919
people so that's kind of how I see that

1690.36 --> 1695.12
and I'm not hurt by it I'm just baffled

1692.919 --> 1695.1200000000001
by

1704.84 --> 1709.6
it I mean is that what this is is like

1707.559 --> 1713.0
like oh

1709.6 --> 1715.76
Christians yeah well nobody is ever

1713.0 --> 1719.48
allowed to do some kind of magical

1715.76 --> 1721.48
healing Spirit healing ever again

1719.48 --> 1724.84
apparently because then it's

1721.48 --> 1724.84
demonic like

1725.24 --> 1731.6
what

1727.799 --> 1735.039
why isn't that like what God

1731.6 --> 1739.399
wants yeah clearly stop

1735.039 --> 1739.399
it is

1739.919 --> 1745.24
even though it is kind of funny it's not

1742.399 --> 1750.08
really that funny it's tragic

1745.24 --> 1750.08
more or can of Pepsi

1751.519 --> 1758.33
God no I'm not going to lower myself to

1754.84 --> 1761.619
like ridicule that on that level

1758.33 --> 1761.619
[Music]

1762.919 --> 1769.3200000000002
it's I just don't understand man

1766.32 --> 1769.32
why

1781.08 --> 1784.96
like yeah I don't get

1790.6 --> 1795.9599999999998
it I mean it's like hey a guy who's like

1794.2 --> 1800.6000000000001
has issues

1795.96 --> 1803.76
and has ideas and it's very like

1800.6 --> 1805.9599999999998
self-reliant with ideas and really does

1803.76 --> 1808.279
his own thing and

1805.96 --> 1812.76
like seeking

1808.279 --> 1816.08
out like weird unknown

1812.76 --> 1818.0
corners and he like heals people like

1816.08 --> 1820.9189999999999
that are good followers and

1818.0 --> 1823.84
just nice people overall and like oh my

1820.919 --> 1825.88
God that's such a threat why why is that

1823.84 --> 1828.84
a threat isn't that just a good thing

1825.88 --> 1831.1200000000001
don't you want somebody that just helps

1828.84 --> 1835.6
heal people in the

1831.12 --> 1835.6
community like why is that a

1839.6 --> 1846.519
problem yeah if you don't accept it if

1843.039 --> 1849.32
you're like no don't you dare do that

1846.519 --> 1852.76
demonic things that don't worry even if

1849.32 --> 1854.6399999999999
I then try it wouldn't work okay don't

1852.76 --> 1855.919
you

1854.64 --> 1858.3200000000002
[Music]

1855.919 --> 1861.159
worry like

1858.32 --> 1861.1589999999999
this is not an

1864.679 --> 1869.24
attack yeah if there's something in you

1867.2 --> 1873.279
that literally like

1869.24 --> 1877.159
refuses if you don't want it to happen

1873.279 --> 1877.159
yeah then it won't

1877.44 --> 1883.3200000000002
happen I

1880.36 --> 1886.4799999999998
mean people see it like the

1883.32 --> 1890.36
ring okay well nobody I applied the

1886.48 --> 1890.3600000000001
technique to has died yet

1890.919 --> 1894.24
so thank

1897.279 --> 1902.919
God and I've done that it's not like the

1900.08 --> 1902.9189999999999
first time I've done

1911.039 --> 1915.44
it

1913.2 --> 1918.48
anyway it's

1915.44 --> 1920.8400000000001
ridiculous yeah I think maybe like stop

1918.48 --> 1924.679
watching Netflix horror

1920.84 --> 1926.84
[ __ ] Supernatural crap up there I mean

1924.679 --> 1929.76
it is very scary

1926.84 --> 1934.84
and it will make you

1929.76 --> 1934.84
see potential scary things underneath

1938.84 --> 1943.76
everything right but you got to trust

1941.36 --> 1947.36
God you got to trust

1943.76 --> 1950.08
like that you know what is real like the

1947.36 --> 1953.9189999999999
biggest chunk of Darkness that people

1950.08 --> 1955.6789999999999
get to deal with in their life are lies

1953.919 --> 1958.24
they believe

1955.679 --> 1960.48
in like Universal and that's not even

1958.24 --> 1963.639
like all about how it's supposed to be

1960.48 --> 1965.72
or the religion it's about just things

1963.639 --> 1968.24
that come to you ideas that come to you

1965.72 --> 1973.08
and you buy into those ideas that come

1968.24 --> 1975.919
out of your own head that are like just

1973.08 --> 1978.36
doing making you do gamma stuff or

1975.919 --> 1980.519
whatever like being nasty being jealous

1978.36 --> 1982.6
envious

1980.519 --> 1985.44
like the

1982.6 --> 1989.399
lies is the biggest chunk of the

1985.44 --> 1993.279
darkness like it's not it's not even

1989.399 --> 1995.6
that dark like the actual reality isn't

1993.279 --> 1998.039
even that dark it's just being piled up

1995.6 --> 1998.039
really

2002.88 --> 2008.3600000000001
high right the news you could consider

2005.799 --> 2011.96
like the news to be like a concentrate

2008.36 --> 2015.6
of bad things that are relatively spread

2011.96 --> 2017.8400000000001
out and a lot of good things happen in

2015.6 --> 2021.76
between that that you never get to hear

2017.84 --> 2024.1589999999999
about right bad news

2021.76 --> 2027.12
spreads the

2024.159 --> 2032.519
fastest of anything

2027.12 --> 2032.5189999999998
right you got to realize that about the

2032.6 --> 2039.1999999999998
darkness cuz dude I am getting like

2036.039 --> 2041.919
piled on with Darkness [ __ ] and people

2039.2 --> 2043.72
that are being nasty and it's like I

2041.919 --> 2045.3600000000001
can't just be like Oh I'm going to be a

2043.72 --> 2049.399
victim about

2045.36 --> 2051.639
it why me and hey I have even done that

2049.399 --> 2054.2
and I'm making fun of myself when I've

2051.639 --> 2056.76
done that because it's like yeah that's

2054.2 --> 2056.7599999999998
completely

2058.399 --> 2063.3199999999997
pointless and I'm going to try to not do

2061.159 --> 2066.9190000000003
that anymore it's just that but it is

2063.32 --> 2070.599
surreal though how many people just go

2066.919 --> 2075.359
completely ape [ __ ] because of good old

2070.599 --> 2078.159
me a guy on YouTube with like less than

2075.359 --> 2078.159
3,000

2078.44 --> 2084.96
subscribers that has shows that to be

2081.919 --> 2087.24
fair guys I mean I really appreciate

2084.96 --> 2090.0
what we got and built together but in

2087.24 --> 2091.9599999999996
the grand scale of what's out there yeah

2090.0 --> 2093.96
my shows aren't really all that

2091.96 --> 2096.599
interesting

2093.96 --> 2098.76
even it's really interesting if you like

2096.599 --> 2100.6800000000003
get into it and and like become part of

2098.76 --> 2104.8
the the community here

2100.68 --> 2106.96
but it's not like super entertainment or

2104.8 --> 2109.8390000000004
anything I

2106.96 --> 2111.4
know this is like kind of like the the

2109.839 --> 2114.119
average

2111.4 --> 2117.599
stuff and I'm okay with

2114.119 --> 2119.56
that right I just try to bring out

2117.599 --> 2122.599
interesting ideas when I spot them but

2119.56 --> 2125.4
it's not like it's all concentrated in a

2122.599 --> 2127.599
perfectly presented pallet of

2125.4 --> 2129.32
entertainment I know it's like a lot of

2127.599 --> 2132.32
Silent

2129.32 --> 2132.32
pauses

2132.56 --> 2141.119
Etc I talk about my own issues and about

2136.88 --> 2143.28
my feelings even right

2141.119 --> 2144.92
so it's

2143.28 --> 2151.0400000000004
not

2144.92 --> 2154.359
like a great entertainment I know so why

2151.04 --> 2157.4
why is everybody having so damn much

2154.359 --> 2161.04
trouble with me good little

2157.4 --> 2161.04
me I don't get

2161.72 --> 2167.2799999999997
it it's

2163.88 --> 2170.76
like get a job get a job ar oh really

2167.28 --> 2173.76
how about those millions of other people

2170.76 --> 2178.48
that don't have a job and that literally

2173.76 --> 2181.7200000000003
don't do anything anything at all they

2178.48 --> 2185.319
don't even know how to

2181.72 --> 2188.0
talk anything yeah at least I'm trying

2185.319 --> 2191.359
to do something with my skills

2188.0 --> 2193.359
here yeah and of course they disapprove

2191.359 --> 2195.52
oh it's such a waste yeah it's not

2193.359 --> 2197.88
working dude it's all just a bunch of

2195.52 --> 2200.7599999999998
gaslighting horse [ __ ] you're just

2197.88 --> 2203.48
projecting your own nastiness and your

2200.76 --> 2207.1600000000003
own failures your own disappointments

2203.48 --> 2209.88
about your own self onto me and it's not

2207.16 --> 2212.359
working it's just bringing out the demon

2209.88 --> 2215.8
in you and it's kind of weird like I go

2212.359 --> 2218.2799999999997
around I feel pretty pure about how I do

2215.8 --> 2221.28
things and then then these people just

2218.28 --> 2224.3190000000004
like just this Fountain of black just

2221.28 --> 2228.0400000000004
starts pouring out of them like an oil

2224.319 --> 2231.2799999999997
well bursting open like what the [ __ ] it

2228.04 --> 2234.2799999999997
why this keeps happening everywhere I go

2231.28 --> 2238.76
people just like and

2234.28 --> 2238.76
just [ __ ] starts pouring

2239.839 --> 2245.56
out I don't get it man well in a way I

2243.72 --> 2247.4399999999996
do get it I mean if I'm applying the

2245.56 --> 2251.119
technique it's really working I

2247.44 --> 2254.7200000000003
apparently have like this energy thing

2251.119 --> 2257.56
and I guess it triggers people to like

2254.72 --> 2260.0789999999997
start the demon just comes

2257.56 --> 2262.72
forth lingering in people in the

2260.079 --> 2265.52
background that are slumbering and like

2262.72 --> 2268.9199999999996
hiding from it and then I do I'm just

2265.52 --> 2269.839
there and the way that I am and they

2268.92 --> 2272.88
just

2269.839 --> 2275.04
like just the Blackness just comes

2272.88 --> 2277.1600000000003
bubbling up and they just have to vomit

2275.04 --> 2279.64
it nonstop

2277.16 --> 2282.72
like until I go away it's all about oh

2279.64 --> 2287.1189999999997
please just go away go away and they

2282.72 --> 2290.8799999999997
don't even know why why they have that

2287.119 --> 2296.04
reaction because just my presence

2290.88 --> 2299.6400000000003
just makes the demons unable to hide in

2296.04 --> 2302.96
people maybe that is the best

2299.64 --> 2305.52
description my presence makes demons

2302.96 --> 2308.359
unable to hide within

2305.52 --> 2310.44
people they can't just Slumber in the

2308.359 --> 2314.2
background anymore

2310.44 --> 2316.56
then so my light is literally agitating

2314.2 --> 2316.56
their

2317.02 --> 2320.11
[Music]

2322.28 --> 2327.96
Shadow yeah gentle bear thanks it just

2326.119 --> 2331.1600000000003
tried to destroy it out of fear it is

2327.96 --> 2335.52
but that's absolutely what it is and

2331.16 --> 2338.52
guess what it doesn't work it really

2335.52 --> 2340.56
doesn't like I am

2338.52 --> 2344.599
protected

2340.56 --> 2348.7599999999998
like I am like doing things in

2344.599 --> 2352.319
service of God and the angels now oh how

2348.76 --> 2354.7200000000003
dare you are you a pope or something no

2352.319 --> 2356.68
I'm just like doing these things that

2354.72 --> 2361.16
are there in existence that you're

2356.68 --> 2364.04
supposed to do and I I'm not entirely

2361.16 --> 2367.1189999999997
sure but I think that God kind of like

2364.04 --> 2368.56
maybe thinks like hm yeah

2367.119 --> 2373.1600000000003
well he's doing

2368.56 --> 2375.839
that he's getting a lot of flack I'll

2373.16 --> 2378.64
I'll make sure that he

2375.839 --> 2380.319
just get stronger against that Flack I

2378.64 --> 2384.44
mean if I'm going to heal people then

2380.319 --> 2386.92
I'm going to maybe become more immune to

2384.44 --> 2389.28
all that [ __ ] from the outside so I'm

2386.92 --> 2392.4
testing this that's why I'm going to

2389.28 --> 2393.5600000000004
more actively apply the technique to

2392.4 --> 2398.4
other

2393.56 --> 2398.4
people you guys to be specific

2398.88 --> 2402.6800000000003
and I'm hope if when it's necessary I

2400.88 --> 2406.839
mean if you're like it's not my thing

2402.68 --> 2409.0
I'm not Le I don't need that hey no

2406.839 --> 2411.16
problem right you don't want it it

2409.0 --> 2413.72
doesn't even

2411.16 --> 2415.44
work unless you secretly want it and

2413.72 --> 2418.5989999999997
then it might

2415.44 --> 2419.76
work but the point is it's like it is

2418.599 --> 2422.52
technically

2419.76 --> 2425.2400000000002
harmless I seem to

2422.52 --> 2427.72
be it seems to be working now that I'm

2425.24 --> 2429.64
doing it and like yeah yeah maybe if

2427.72 --> 2431.04
I'll do it it things will be better and

2429.64 --> 2433.5989999999997
it will be a chance for me to

2431.04 --> 2435.88
empirically find out does this in some

2433.599 --> 2439.1600000000003
way drain

2435.88 --> 2442.1600000000003
me or does it do the

2439.16 --> 2445.04
opposite it is this all new grounds for

2442.16 --> 2447.52
me I have not read the book on the

2445.04 --> 2449.52
technique yeah I don't even know what to

2447.52 --> 2451.64
call it I just call it the technique

2449.52 --> 2455.319
because I never given a

2451.64 --> 2459.1189999999997
name it's just something he

2455.319 --> 2462.7599999999998
does and I copied it and I can do it on

2459.119 --> 2462.76
myself and on

2463.24 --> 2469.56
others and him doing that with me has

2466.4 --> 2471.52
literally like saved my life is my

2469.56 --> 2475.0
healer

2471.52 --> 2479.64
religious not in the regular sense

2475.0 --> 2482.64
no but he's like thally into the Rudolph

2479.64 --> 2482.64
Steiner

2483.56 --> 2488.04
system but he absolutely knows there's a

2486.52 --> 2491.2
God

2488.04 --> 2493.64
creator yeah and he does absolutely

2491.2 --> 2496.96
believe in

2493.64 --> 2499.5989999999997
Jesus Jesus Christ and he just like it's

2496.96 --> 2502.44
just formulated slightly different he's

2499.599 --> 2506.119
more emphasizing like the spirit of

2502.44 --> 2508.52
Christ like and that's regarded through

2506.119 --> 2512.119
Rudolph Steiner's Insight like as an

2508.52 --> 2515.28
entity that is there and you could call

2512.119 --> 2517.079
that God sure if you like but I mean

2515.28 --> 2520.76
it's not really

2517.079 --> 2525.52
regarded like that so it's like it all

2520.76 --> 2525.5200000000004
just really fits for

2525.96 --> 2532.56
me so yeah my real healer is not

2529.16 --> 2536.44
religious in a regular sense

2532.56 --> 2538.599
no he does not go to a church as far as

2536.44 --> 2538.599
I

2544.28 --> 2548.1600000000003
know right

2549.079 --> 2554.0
yeah by the way the title has nothing to

2551.839 --> 2556.92
do with what I've been talking about so

2554.0 --> 2559.839
far but that's based on I had an after

2556.92 --> 2564.16
own Benjamin I like kind of to get my

2559.839 --> 2569.52
mind of the trolling crap when over to

2564.16 --> 2569.52
uh what's it called again Earthbound

2574.68 --> 2579.7599999999998
no hold on let me find out what it was

2585.72 --> 2591.3089999999997
called damn it where is

2588.04 --> 2591.3089999999997
[Music]

2597.52 --> 2601.24
it anyways that

2604.4 --> 2609.0
server maybe here can find it

2610.76 --> 2617.0
back damn it where is

2614.079 --> 2620.559
it any yeah it's that Discord server

2617.0 --> 2623.599
that does streams like one stream on

2620.559 --> 2625.96
Rumble and on YouTube and Nathan also

2623.599 --> 2629.319
joined that I keep forgetting the

2625.96 --> 2629.319
name hey

2633.16 --> 2637.7599999999998
what but anyway I went on it and like

2635.64 --> 2642.319
had it discussion about

2637.76 --> 2644.559
well light the speed light speed claim

2642.319 --> 2648.7599999999998
and The Ether

2644.559 --> 2650.88
claim and basically this is the title is

2648.76 --> 2652.0
the main point that I came out to it's

2650.88 --> 2655.92
like yeah you're

2652.0 --> 2660.079
stuck between an

2655.92 --> 2663.16
assumption and the necessity for a thing

2660.079 --> 2665.3590000000004
to provide for the Assumption so it's

2663.16 --> 2666.92
like a false dichotomy that's created

2665.359 --> 2668.319
out of nothing

2666.92 --> 2671.64
and you can just leave it out and

2668.319 --> 2673.48
everything works fine right we could

2671.64 --> 2677.4
talk about that we could continue on

2673.48 --> 2680.72
about the more religious stuff and all

2677.4 --> 2683.88
that but I thought I just wanted to

2680.72 --> 2687.0
bring up explanation about the

2683.88 --> 2691.76
title does light require a

2687.0 --> 2693.88
medium uh it requires a

2691.76 --> 2696.5200000000004
volume of

2693.88 --> 2698.8
transparent of a transparent situation

2696.52 --> 2698.8
pretty

2699.559 --> 2705.1600000000003
much so yeah in technically light does

2702.64 --> 2709.16
require a medium but it it doesn't

2705.16 --> 2709.16
require a medium for it to be a

2711.24 --> 2718.0
wave it's just it it requires space

2715.16 --> 2721.319
space available that is transparent

2718.0 --> 2724.88
enough or like physically

2721.319 --> 2727.88
nothing in order for it to manifest

2724.88 --> 2727.88
instantaneously

2728.92 --> 2734.6800000000003
right but it a

2730.72 --> 2737.3999999999996
vacuum is just fine you won't be able to

2734.68 --> 2740.0789999999997
see the light cuz it's not going to like

2737.4 --> 2742.119
reflect of anything in that vacuum in

2740.079 --> 2743.6400000000003
order for it to reach your eye and so

2742.119 --> 2745.44
that you could perceive it but it's

2743.64 --> 2750.44
there

2745.44 --> 2754.2000000000003
though all it needs is available

2750.44 --> 2757.839
space the wave is just the

2754.2 --> 2761.1189999999997
frequency yeah but the frequency is also

2757.839 --> 2763.599
like even the idea of that is based of

2761.119 --> 2765.559
the Mis assumption the wave kind of like

2763.599 --> 2768.04
it came into

2765.559 --> 2770.3190000000004
being because literally they don't know

2768.04 --> 2772.92
how else to regard the whole

2770.319 --> 2774.7599999999998
thing yeah the idea of light

2772.92 --> 2779.16
frequency

2774.76 --> 2782.2400000000002
like it's all just a word for something

2779.16 --> 2788.64
that functions kind of like a

2782.24 --> 2788.64
spectrum right it's whole range of

2789.24 --> 2794.4399999999996
situational well of a situation of the

2791.96 --> 2796.96
light different

2794.44 --> 2799.599
effects and they're on a spectrum and

2796.96 --> 2802.559
they just like oh well maybe it is like

2799.599 --> 2804.96
a frequency right so it's a theoretical

2802.559 --> 2807.7200000000003
construct of frequencies based on Wave

2804.96 --> 2810.76
ideas and and so like that wave wave

2807.72 --> 2813.48
wave it's moving it's a wave it all just

2810.76 --> 2816.3590000000004
like ingrains into your mind because of

2813.48 --> 2818.72
the phraseology of describing the

2816.359 --> 2821.5589999999997
effects of

2818.72 --> 2825.319
light but there's no proof of the actual

2821.559 --> 2828.3190000000004
wave or a speed it's all just

2825.319 --> 2828.319
assumed

2832.88 --> 2838.0
anyway Jo ask ether believe what ether

2835.839 --> 2840.24
is yeah well they just do go into the

2838.0 --> 2842.96
whole the wheelie right I call that the

2840.24 --> 2846.64
wheelie cuz Ken wheeler kind of invented

2842.96 --> 2850.28
it I can't even do that it annoys me too

2846.64 --> 2853.16
it's just doing like a bunch of a

2850.28 --> 2855.559
wheelie going around techn babbling

2853.16 --> 2859.0789999999997
quickly all these different little

2855.559 --> 2861.6400000000003
effects yeah that literally have

2859.079 --> 2863.96
absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with

2861.64 --> 2866.359
one another but it's just if you just

2863.96 --> 2869.119
say it really quickly it's like almost

2866.359 --> 2870.0
like it's one thing and that's the trick

2869.119 --> 2873.04
that's the

2870.0 --> 2876.88
wheelie just ramble off a whole bunch of

2873.04 --> 2879.2799999999997
effects that are all found in like

2876.88 --> 2882.119
Engineering in electrical devices that

2879.28 --> 2884.8
are all man-made and all that and then

2882.119 --> 2888.7200000000003
just like say just really quickly after

2884.8 --> 2891.88
one another and that means ether somehow

2888.72 --> 2894.16
but none of these things have any actual

2891.88 --> 2897.6800000000003
connection to one another

2894.16 --> 2901.24
whatsoever does my healer have a channel

2897.68 --> 2904.7999999999997
no he completely not on the

2901.24 --> 2908.4799999999996
internet uh my healer had monstrous

2904.8 --> 2911.0
trolls that literally gave him death

2908.48 --> 2916.359
threats like and that

2911.0 --> 2921.24
happened like 20 years ago

2916.359 --> 2925.16
okay so no you cannot find my healer on

2921.24 --> 2925.16
the internet I am actually

2925.76 --> 2932.28
like the best thing you're going to get

2929.48 --> 2936.359
in that sense like I'll talk about it

2932.28 --> 2939.52
I'll actually do it yeah he is like no

2936.359 --> 2939.52
internet at

2940.079 --> 2946.599
all like he has like private chat groups

2943.359 --> 2949.64
and and all that and it's private he

2946.599 --> 2951.48
does not do anything in public on the

2949.64 --> 2954.5589999999997
internet and you can't find him anywhere

2951.48 --> 2954.559
and he does not have a

2962.04 --> 2967.52
website yes healing and spiritual stuff

2964.76 --> 2967.5200000000004
I think

2969.079 --> 2978.079
Santos I don't know maybe maybe Santos

2973.319 --> 2981.92
has some similar techniques but I mean

2978.079 --> 2985.57
Santos like his belief structure

2981.92 --> 2988.079
is I don't trust that at

2985.57 --> 2991.52
[Music]

2988.079 --> 2994.3590000000004
all and I don't like his energy at all

2991.52 --> 2997.839
and he does not look healthy at all if

2994.359 --> 3001.64
you ask me so

2997.839 --> 3004.52
no I never really like the guy that much

3001.64 --> 3008.839
I mean I'm not going to like oh Sant how

3004.52 --> 3010.92
dare you go doomed no it's just like I

3008.839 --> 3013.799
don't really trust it I don't want to

3010.92 --> 3016.44
have really any association with

3013.799 --> 3019.4
that

3016.44 --> 3022.2000000000003
and I'm just going to do my own

3019.4 --> 3025.64
thing yeah there's no use in trying to

3022.2 --> 3029.4399999999996
persecute other other people it's like

3025.64 --> 3032.52
let God do the Judgment yeah if they're

3029.44 --> 3036.319
wrong they're going to pay the price

3032.52 --> 3040.24
they will stumble they will falter they

3036.319 --> 3042.2799999999997
will have crisises Crisis crisis yeah

3040.24 --> 3044.24
they will have crisis of conscious and

3042.28 --> 3046.88
all that like and doubts about what

3044.24 --> 3049.8799999999997
they're doing yeah that's how you know

3046.88 --> 3052.96
that's how you know it's

3049.88 --> 3057.079
wrong right

3052.96 --> 3059.52
and and as you say to new

3057.079 --> 3061.6800000000003
AG what is he what what does he think

3059.52 --> 3064.24
about Jesus Christ and not about oh you

3061.68 --> 3065.68
have to say the chant but just like at

3064.24 --> 3069.04
all

3065.68 --> 3071.839
right is he like Eric du like he

3069.04 --> 3074.839
denounces that entirely I don't want to

3071.839 --> 3079.96
have anything to do with that right well

3074.839 --> 3079.96
that's very telling to me

3080.119 --> 3086.04
right I mean if you have Christ allergy

3084.16 --> 3088.799
that's a problem

3086.04 --> 3092.2799999999997
for me and I think for God

3088.799 --> 3095.839
too right not that God demands that you

3092.28 --> 3099.28
think of Jesus Christ as God but if

3095.839 --> 3101.88
you're like get Christ away from me

3099.28 --> 3105.2400000000002
that's an that's an issue not for

3101.88 --> 3109.4
anybody but you

3105.24 --> 3109.3999999999996
so do I believe in

3109.559 --> 3114.3590000000004
magic uh that depends on what you're

3112.0 --> 3116.12
going to Define as magic

3114.359 --> 3119.3199999999997
duper

3116.12 --> 3119.3199999999997
[Music]

3120.68 --> 3126.5589999999997
I mean magic is kind of like the

3122.92 --> 3126.559
ultimate catch all

3143.359 --> 3147.52
phrase I just see it like this I believe

3145.88 --> 3151.04
in things that

3147.52 --> 3154.119
work and I believe

3151.04 --> 3158.359
that some of those things will

3154.119 --> 3163.319
defy people's General understanding and

3158.359 --> 3167.2
especially their understanding based on

3163.319 --> 3167.2
doctrine that comes from

3168.64 --> 3174.96
society and to those people it will be

3171.44 --> 3175.88
like magic but I mean what is Magic you

3174.96 --> 3179.16
know

3175.88 --> 3179.1600000000003
I'm it's

3179.2 --> 3186.2
just it's a very loaded word in many

3184.13 --> 3189.599
[Music]

3186.2 --> 3192.5989999999997
ways what load blue build Evolution and

3189.599 --> 3195.599
Len Lenox could see all constant

3192.599 --> 3195.599
chips

3203.76 --> 3210.559
right Road

3206.52 --> 3210.559
what what the hell does that even

3225.4 --> 3231.04
mean right but anyway let me all magic

3228.96 --> 3233.0
is is bringing many correspondents

3231.04 --> 3235.7599999999998
together to make something more less

3233.0 --> 3238.92
likely to occur that is is a very

3235.76 --> 3244.1600000000003
interesting way to put it

3238.92 --> 3244.16
l you have some interesting Insight

3245.599 --> 3250.6400000000003
sometimes but let me just be the first

3248.2 --> 3254.7599999999998
to say I don't know anything about how

3250.64 --> 3258.799
people do this out there

3254.76 --> 3261.48
but if you think that the way you

3258.799 --> 3266.24
pronounce the words and the

3261.48 --> 3268.04
sounds matters when it comes to like

3266.24 --> 3271.24
healing and even the technique and all

3268.04 --> 3272.359
that think again like it is only about

3271.24 --> 3275.9599999999996
the

3272.359 --> 3275.96
information within your

3278.76 --> 3284.3590000000004
spirit that the only way that like

3281.4 --> 3286.28
sounds that come out of your mouth for

3284.359 --> 3288.16
example and how you pronounce it can

3286.28 --> 3292.4
actually influence

3288.16 --> 3295.1189999999997
things is like

3292.4 --> 3297.88
psychological like like on an

3295.119 --> 3301.52
animalistic level I mean sounds work

3297.88 --> 3304.599
like on animals I do it all the

3301.52 --> 3307.119
time like I can make cat do things with

3304.599 --> 3309.0
certain sounds dogs too like they

3307.119 --> 3310.839
definitely respond to like what type of

3309.0 --> 3313.68
sounds you make like I just pay

3310.839 --> 3317.0789999999997
attention to that a lot right so sounds

3313.68 --> 3319.3999999999996
make a difference on a animalistic

3317.079 --> 3321.44
level but when you're interfacing with

3319.4 --> 3323.799
gods that has nothing to do with any of

3321.44 --> 3326.2400000000002
that yeah prayers can be completely

3323.799 --> 3327.839
silent it's all about the information

3326.24 --> 3329.72
and your

3327.839 --> 3333.0389999999998
Consciousness and how you're like

3329.72 --> 3333.0389999999998
connecting through

3338.88 --> 3342.44
that what the

3344.48 --> 3349.079
[ __ ]

3346.079 --> 3349.079
okay

3354.0 --> 3358.92
uh

3356.599 --> 3362.76
kind of a remark is

3358.92 --> 3366.039
that yeah don't just

3362.76 --> 3366.039
don't not

3370.359 --> 3374.7599999999998
funny if the next remark is not

3373.16 --> 3377.24
something more productive I'm just going

3374.76 --> 3377.2400000000002
to ban

3379.839 --> 3386.92
you cuz no that's not going to

3383.92 --> 3386.92
happen

3388.88 --> 3395.6400000000003
uh three mag from Persia T is about

3392.119 --> 3398.559
speaking things into existence yeah who

3395.64 --> 3402.2799999999997
oh my God that's no they were they were

3398.559 --> 3405.0
teaching him about demons

3402.28 --> 3409.6800000000003
demons oh wait that's Jesus Christ that

3405.0 --> 3409.68
you believe is God oh

3410.039 --> 3413.039
right

3413.88 --> 3416.88
yeah

3426.72 --> 3431.16
hey Rick back good see

3428.559 --> 3433.88
you interesting TI of I talked about it

3431.16 --> 3437.96
yet just a little

3433.88 --> 3437.96
bit we're talking more

3440.319 --> 3446.799
about applying the

3443.799 --> 3446.799
technique

3447.64 --> 3454.0
I have I got to rearrange the title

3449.92 --> 3457.76
let's see what I can fit okay got 24

3454.0 --> 3457.76
characters left I'm going to do

3464.359 --> 3469.2
this I could summarize it into wave

3467.16 --> 3472.2
medium false

3469.2 --> 3472.2
dichotomy

3473.799 --> 3476.799
uh

3479.71 --> 3495.119
[Music]

3491.799 --> 3495.119
ah damn it doesn't

3500.72 --> 3505.839
fit

3502.559 --> 3507.88
nah what

3505.839 --> 3510.16
oh Nathan is premiering again so he

3507.88 --> 3512.6800000000003
still not doing a live stream I'm going

3510.16 --> 3515.359
to keep the title The Way It

3512.68 --> 3518.3999999999996
Is

3515.359 --> 3521.4
uh do you know the success

3518.4 --> 3521.4
rate

3529.0 --> 3533.72
no I mean if you apply it properly it

3531.88 --> 3536.7200000000003
should be

3533.72 --> 3536.72
100%

3541.119 --> 3548.88
when Jesus performed miracles did people

3543.359 --> 3548.88
call it demonic uh really jealous people

3549.52 --> 3558.0
maybe can I apply to myself

3554.119 --> 3561.92
yes I do that every day I've been doing

3558.0 --> 3566.16
that every day for over a

3561.92 --> 3568.599
year and sometimes it doesn't work

3566.16 --> 3574.319
because it doesn't you can't do it on

3568.599 --> 3574.319
yourself if you're like too it too much

3580.88 --> 3586.559
disjointed yeah probably box

3583.559 --> 3586.559
sidebuster

3586.92 --> 3591.599
probably can the technique be learned

3593.64 --> 3598.2
yeah

3596.4 --> 3600.599
it's actually kind of funny because I

3598.2 --> 3602.0789999999997
taught it to my friend in and she's

3600.599 --> 3605.52
doing it

3602.079 --> 3608.799
too and it's like really working

3605.52 --> 3611.839
although it's so still experimental

3608.799 --> 3615.24
like it's really weird at first when you

3611.839 --> 3618.68
start doing that because it's just like

3615.24 --> 3621.5589999999997
you're not used to just doing that and

3618.68 --> 3626.5589999999997
then expecting it to work it's it's so

3621.559 --> 3626.559
surreal it was so surreal to me

3631.4 --> 3637.039
I don't know about that buckbuster I'm

3633.319 --> 3639.0
not going to judge anything but hey it's

3637.039 --> 3641.8390000000004
whatever the people want you know it's

3639.0 --> 3643.88
whatever his fans want either they're

3641.839 --> 3646.2
going to be like yeah I'll keep throwing

3643.88 --> 3648.359
money at that no at that new computer of

3646.2 --> 3649.839
yours or they're going to be like yeah

3648.359 --> 3654.68
I'm kind of sick

3649.839 --> 3658.2
of like your yearly computer breakdown

3654.68 --> 3658.2
right it's up to

3658.28 --> 3664.88
them like I'm staying out of it my

3661.599 --> 3667.1600000000003
computer ain't breaking down I hope and

3664.88 --> 3670.079
if I will then I will desperately

3667.16 --> 3670.0789999999997
contact all of

3672.76 --> 3679.44
you I still have like a backup laptop so

3676.44 --> 3682.4
I could do that but I mean I can do a a

3679.44 --> 3687.119
show on that thing but I

3682.4 --> 3687.119
can like get on this Discord

3688.079 --> 3691.92
and and get in

3692.039 --> 3695.6800000000003
Skype right but I mean I don't think

3694.2 --> 3697.96
that's going to be

3695.68 --> 3702.2
necessary anytime soon my computer's

3697.96 --> 3702.2
doing great it's doing absolutely

3706.64 --> 3714.2
fine like no no no don't

3711.079 --> 3716.92
super no leave you don't even know what

3714.2 --> 3721.9199999999996
the technique is you could like do it as

3716.92 --> 3723.839
a as just a word but no this is not some

3721.92 --> 3727.079
stupid game

3723.839 --> 3727.0789999999997
thing like

3727.24 --> 3730.5989999999997
that yeah

3743.359 --> 3746.359
don't

3749.799 --> 3755.839
what okay Lo build Evolution I don't

3752.279 --> 3755.839
know what you're talking about

3764.119 --> 3770.4
but

3766.799 --> 3770.4
emulated okay what does that

3773.0 --> 3780.799
mean and might be the answer to

3776.76 --> 3782.7990000000004
what oh hey Tommy sve yeah thanks I'm

3780.799 --> 3785.16
having I'm having a great time this

3782.799 --> 3785.16
stream

3792.2 --> 3796.4399999999996
today

3793.799 --> 3799.4
copied I don't

3796.44 --> 3801.96
understand like so you're just saying

3799.4 --> 3805.279
okay PCS are way better than Apple and

3801.96 --> 3807.92
they can just copy them entirely

3805.279 --> 3807.92
streaming and

3809.76 --> 3812.76
editing

3820.119 --> 3825.799
okay that's kind of funny because my dad

3822.72 --> 3829.16
has an apple that has a PC emulator in

3825.799 --> 3829.16
it it's the other way

3833.279 --> 3836.279
around

3837.76 --> 3843.079
grab of Dell PCS that were being

3840.359 --> 3844.5589999999997
upgraded oh cool do you have some old

3843.079 --> 3847.039
keyboards

3844.559 --> 3851.119
buckbuster like the really old keyboards

3847.039 --> 3853.7990000000004
from the 90s because I really want

3851.119 --> 3857.119
those like the the ones that I have are

3853.799 --> 3860.72
just like so old man been using them for

3857.119 --> 3863.52
like 20 years it's getting kind of

3860.72 --> 3866.2
ridiculous it's a miracle they even work

3863.52 --> 3866.2
at all

3873.52 --> 3877.7599999999998
modern keyboards

3875.599 --> 3879.319
oh

3877.76 --> 3882.7200000000003
uh

3879.319 --> 3885.16
bo I want the old one with the hard

3882.72 --> 3885.16
clicky

3886.839 --> 3891.48
clicky I mean eventually I'll probably

3889.52 --> 3894.4
just be able to have them made or

3891.48 --> 3897.0
something like made them new like the

3894.4 --> 3901.6800000000003
old style keyboard made new with like

3897.0 --> 3905.839
updated chips and all that but like

3901.68 --> 3905.839
mechanically exactly like the old

3906.279 --> 3910.76
style cuz that the old keyboards are

3908.92 --> 3914.599
just the

3910.76 --> 3917.6400000000003
best all that stuff soft stuff is just

3914.599 --> 3919.7200000000003
uh annoying like you have to feel when

3917.64 --> 3922.24
you when you press the key you have to

3919.72 --> 3922.24
feel a

3922.559 --> 3927.7200000000003
click they do make

3924.68 --> 3931.0
the clicking keyboards new

3927.72 --> 3935.2
right yeah no it's not

3931.0 --> 3935.2
gay no touch screen is

3949.52 --> 3954.839
gay right but anyway I don't really I

3951.96 --> 3957.4
just thought maybe you had a keyboard

3954.839 --> 3960.24
left over that would be cool but I mean

3957.4 --> 3961.76
I don't need a new keyboard as an

3960.24 --> 3963.9599999999996
emergency or

3961.76 --> 3966.599
anything but if you just happen to have

3963.96 --> 3966.599
them that would be

3983.0 --> 3986.0
cool

3998.119 --> 4002.6400000000003
stack of PCS okay

4004.279 --> 4007.279
what

4013.0 --> 4016.0
cool

4047.319 --> 4053.16
all right anyhow uh let's get back what

4050.559 --> 4053.1600000000003
we're talking

4072.92 --> 4075.92
about

4082.599 --> 4088.6800000000003
Corporate America is wasteful with

4085.68 --> 4088.68
technology

4092.16 --> 4099.44
H well isn't corporate anything pretty

4096.44 --> 4101.5199999999995
much wasteful with everything it's

4099.44 --> 4103.04
corporate it's just a dead husk like the

4101.52 --> 4105.719
people don't care unless there's like

4103.04 --> 4106.56
money in it for

4105.719 --> 4111.08
I

4106.56 --> 4111.080000000001
mean it's not just America I

4123.6 --> 4128.839
think losing your motivation for coding

4132.799 --> 4135.799
why

4136.04 --> 4141.12
don't you want to have at least like a

4138.199 --> 4143.5599999999995
basic thing that's going to work just

4141.12 --> 4143.5599999999995
for the

4156.04 --> 4162.0
test oh well but yeah who might to talk

4159.839 --> 4162.0
you

4162.719 --> 4165.719
know

4182.08 --> 4186.839
you don't understand certain things well

4184.199 --> 4186.839
look them up

4189.719 --> 4195.719
then I mean look that these days there

4193.12 --> 4195.719
are like

4195.92 --> 4202.0
video instruction manuals about all

4198.84 --> 4205.64
those things on YouTube alone

4202.0 --> 4207.88
so if you can't understand something try

4205.64 --> 4213.12
to find it try to find somebody that

4207.88 --> 4213.12
will specifically explain that or dig in

4217.0 --> 4222.08
forums or contact Buck

4220.159 --> 4224.799999999999
sodbuster but I mean if you're going to

4222.08 --> 4227.5199999999995
do specialist talk please don't just do

4224.8 --> 4230.159000000001
that in my chat I don't

4227.52 --> 4231.8
want technical stuff going back and

4230.159 --> 4234.719
forth in there it's not good

4231.8 --> 4237.0
conversation just do that like an

4234.719 --> 4239.12
private conversation please don't worry

4237.0 --> 4241.4
don't worry I mean I appreciate that

4239.12 --> 4243.12
you're offering him help just not I

4241.4 --> 4246.5599999999995
don't want you two to like do the

4243.12 --> 4246.5599999999995
technical discretion here in my

4246.6 --> 4251.719
chat that's all I do want you to

4249.92 --> 4255.159
actually help him that would be

4251.719 --> 4257.36
great but uh

4255.159 --> 4260.0
I don't know D

4257.36 --> 4262.4
like ever thought of just like

4260.0 --> 4265.92
contacting me on Skype or something

4262.4 --> 4265.92
outside of

4274.32 --> 4280.4
YouTube I'm kind of hoping to have more

4277.199 --> 4285.04
of you just like become part of my Skype

4280.4 --> 4288.32
group so that you guys can communicate

4285.04 --> 4290.04
like outside of my shows like in there

4288.32 --> 4291.92
you're definitely not going to get

4290.04 --> 4294.6
trolled or anything

4291.92 --> 4296.92
right by Outsider so that's like the

4294.6 --> 4299.8
benefit for that and it's like invite

4296.92 --> 4299.8
only

4312.56 --> 4315.56
so

4326.28 --> 4333.4
reading don't no don't go talking about

4329.36 --> 4333.4
that for the love of

4336.6 --> 4342.4800000000005
God I definitely don't want to talk

4339.88 --> 4345.4800000000005
about that in the chat thank you very

4342.48 --> 4345.48
much

4345.92 --> 4351.36
like Nathan already makes videos about

4348.8 --> 4355.4800000000005
that why didn't you discuss it in the

4351.36 --> 4355.48
comment section of those videos

4363.199 --> 4367.599999999999
okay right I'm going to put my

4365.0 --> 4370.239
Illuminati C on in the oven I'm getting

4367.6 --> 4372.4400000000005
hungry uh

4370.239 --> 4375.44
anyway be right

4372.44 --> 4375.44
back

4402.36 --> 4405.36
for

4462.28 --> 4465.28
for

4532.93 --> 4536.029
[Music]

4536.679 --> 4543.04
could use his PC to he him that's funny

4540.36 --> 4543.04
thank you for

4543.46 --> 4551.39
[Music]

4552.199 --> 4555.199
that

4568.719 --> 4571.719
what

4582.12 --> 4585.12
okay

4593.11 --> 4597.88
[Music]

4595.679 --> 4599.12
yeah all the stupid moonlandings like

4597.88 --> 4602.2390000000005
what are you going to achieve with that

4599.12 --> 4604.23
anyway it's so not just doing the same

4602.239 --> 4607.74
damn stupid

4604.23 --> 4607.74
[Music]

4610.79 --> 4615.08
[Music]

4612.08 --> 4615.08
trick

4621.08 --> 4624.5199999999995
[Music]

4637.679 --> 4641.2390000000005
a couple of 12y olds could land Craft on

4640.0 --> 4645.0
the

4641.239 --> 4645.0
moon well you could certainly

4645.239 --> 4651.239
animate doing that

4648.239 --> 4653.599999999999
sure I mean before you know it there

4651.239 --> 4657.32
will be like the AI programs that will

4653.6 --> 4661.76
just like do your own moon landing and

4657.32 --> 4664.799999999999
they will just make it make it like all

4661.76 --> 4666.8
the yeah just completely simulate it's

4664.8 --> 4670.6
like the moonlander simulator and they

4666.8 --> 4673.96
just do the I I just does everything for

4670.6 --> 4675.56
you like you two can land simulate like

4673.96 --> 4677.639
you're landing on the moon and nobody

4675.56 --> 4679.4400000000005
would be able to tell the

4677.639 --> 4683.400000000001
difference except that you're not going

4679.44 --> 4683.4
to have like press conferences about

4700.159 --> 4704.92
it

4701.92 --> 4704.92
yeah

4707.28 --> 4710.12
like what are you going to achieve with

4708.8 --> 4712.679
that you

4710.12 --> 4715.04
know yay we got a lot of stuff on the

4712.679 --> 4718.679
moon and

4715.04 --> 4718.679
then just more

4718.88 --> 4724.88
stuff and then do

4721.32 --> 4726.599999999999
nothing like always like never ever do

4724.88 --> 4728.8
anything just send stuff there and

4726.6 --> 4728.8
that's

4731.92 --> 4734.92
it

4745.84 --> 4750.76
incredible

4747.76 --> 4750.76
technology

4761.84 --> 4764.84
what

4772.199 --> 4779.48
like what incredible technology like

4776.239 --> 4781.678999999999
what what's this incredible technology

4779.48 --> 4784.799999999999
you're talking about Buck

4781.679 --> 4789.2390000000005
Buster space

4784.8 --> 4794.6
coffee made from recycled FES and water

4789.239 --> 4798.08
from piss like what what exactly

4794.6 --> 4798.08
the technology they're using

4799.56 --> 4802.56
today

4803.04 --> 4810.12
okay so in 10 years we will be using the

4807.36 --> 4812.92
technology that we can't use to go to

4810.12 --> 4812.92
the Moon with

4815.32 --> 4819.92
either battery operated power

4820.76 --> 4824.76
tools wow

4830.28 --> 4835.639
okay water

4832.92 --> 4839.28
filtration excuse me

4835.639 --> 4840.8
but water filtration definitely existed

4839.28 --> 4843.159
before nowas I

4840.8 --> 4844.6
did just because they just helped

4843.159 --> 4848.5599999999995
develop it a

4844.6 --> 4848.56
lot doesn't mean it wasn't

4851.719 --> 4854.719
there

4855.92 --> 4862.4400000000005
but yeah perfected fair enough but I

4859.88 --> 4866.12
mean what they could have done instead

4862.44 --> 4870.879999999999
was just perfect the technology and not

4866.12 --> 4872.8
like waste like billions on it to do

4870.88 --> 4874.639
something fake with it just say like oh

4872.8 --> 4877.76
let's perfect this technology let's make

4874.639 --> 4880.639
it better and then make some profit with

4877.76 --> 4884.639
it instead of just wasting gigantic

4880.639 --> 4884.639
amounts of money on something that can't

4886.48 --> 4893.799999999999
happen right but I I agree like I got an

4891.12 --> 4896.639
air filter it doesn't work anymore it

4893.8 --> 4898.360000000001
could be repaired but I mean whatever I

4896.639 --> 4900.88
haven't really used it in a while but it

4898.36 --> 4903.5599999999995
also uses NASA technology they

4900.88 --> 4907.639
advertised it even cuz they had this

4903.56 --> 4912.04
special uh honeycomb grid thing through

4907.639 --> 4913.76
which UV light shine onto that and like

4912.04 --> 4919.5199999999995
air goes goes through

4913.76 --> 4919.52
that and that really helps it

4921.199 --> 4927.919999999999
like it

4923.84 --> 4930.679
helps it apparently like neutralizes

4927.92 --> 4933.6
bacteria fungus especially the fungus

4930.679 --> 4936.1990000000005
part I find very nice that it would be

4933.6 --> 4936.1990000000005
able to do

4936.48 --> 4943.799999999999
that right but even despite that I

4938.84 --> 4945.52
haven't like used it in six years now

4943.8 --> 4948.04
five years something I don't remember

4945.52 --> 4950.52
when exactly it broke it yeah when it

4948.04 --> 4953.36
came here it was still working but it

4950.52 --> 4956.280000000001
would have been nice but I mean I am

4953.36 --> 4956.28
kind of doing

4957.44 --> 4963.239
fine

4959.44 --> 4966.36
so because like 10 years ago I thought I

4963.239 --> 4969.4
really needed those now I'm like no I

4966.36 --> 4969.4
don't need them that

4971.56 --> 4977.719
much guess who vented the computer mouse

4975.36 --> 4977.719
I don't

4989.0 --> 4993.239
know NASA created the

5001.48 --> 5004.48
fan

5008.0 --> 5015.92
wow yeah well that's cool bugbuster if

5011.56 --> 5021.52
only they wouldn't waste so damn much

5015.92 --> 5024.2390000000005
money you know i' prefer a research

5021.52 --> 5027.8
group that would actually figure out

5024.239 --> 5030.5199999999995
technology and then not cost insane

5027.8 --> 5034.08
amounts of money to achieve nothing but

5030.52 --> 5037.6
the development of Technology

5034.08 --> 5037.6
y that would be

5052.52 --> 5056.719
great thought it was serx I didn't even

5055.08 --> 5060.8
know what that

5056.719 --> 5060.8
is so I don't

5061.36 --> 5064.36
care

5073.199 --> 5076.638999999999
you got to go all right see you

5077.92 --> 5081.88
later that you have a good day

5091.36 --> 5094.36
too

5116.119 --> 5124.28
all right so yeah well he drugg me all

5120.08 --> 5124.28
the way over there what are we talking

5133.84 --> 5138.32
about talking about me applying the

5140.719 --> 5145.639
technique then all this computer talk

5151.28 --> 5154.28
started

5157.56 --> 5164.679
I'm just wondering should I get a bit of

5160.36 --> 5168.04
coffee maybe a little coffee not an

5164.679 --> 5168.04
entire big

5174.84 --> 5178.719
glass Cofe

5181.199 --> 5184.199
yes

5188.239 --> 5192.32
I am mostly hungry though so I'll just

5190.04 --> 5194.239
settle for Illuminati cassan and if then

5192.32 --> 5197.08
halfway I still feel like I want a

5194.239 --> 5199.32
coffee then maybe I'll do it I'll be

5197.08 --> 5199.32
right

5211.199 --> 5214.199
back

5241.119 --> 5244.119

so what are we going to talk about

5525.6 --> 5532.360000000001
guys otherwise I'm just going to eat

5529.0 --> 5535.08
this and just

5532.36 --> 5536.159
wait go back to the subject we were

5535.08 --> 5539.88
talking

5536.159 --> 5542.759999999999
about go back to the whole light having

5539.88 --> 5545.04
a speed assumption object if you guys

5542.76 --> 5548.159000000001
want but whatever we're going to talk

5545.04 --> 5552.59
about it's not going to be

5548.159 --> 5555.709
computers as long as that is abundantly

5552.59 --> 5555.709
[Music]

5568.199 --> 5575.48
clear want to talk about the line what

5573.119 --> 5575.48
what do you

5578.96 --> 5587.2390000000005
mean you mean like the train stations in

5582.679 --> 5590.88
England that line but they're

5587.239 --> 5593.959999999999
insane Overkill sjw self-destructive

5590.88 --> 5597.52
policy oh no that line okay from Saudi

5593.96 --> 5597.52
Arabia okay

5599.48 --> 5603.5599999999995
why yeah duper he's not here

5608.719 --> 5614.44
anymore it doesn't

5611.119 --> 5617.32
curve yeah okay that's a fair enough

5614.44 --> 5621.32
Point clearly I mean yeah the Earth is

5617.32 --> 5623.239
definitely flat and not a spinning

5621.32 --> 5625.36
ball

5623.239 --> 5628.159
indeed that all

5625.36 --> 5630.5599999999995
architecture is all relying upon the

5628.159 --> 5632.839999999999
Earth being

5630.56 --> 5635.280000000001
flat

5632.84 --> 5638.52
and the bigger the piece of architecture

5635.28 --> 5641.5199999999995
the more the architect will have to take

5638.52 --> 5644.639
into account how incredibly flat it is

5641.52 --> 5644.639
and has to be

5645.199 --> 5650.21

5667.08 --> 5674.0
one of those guys who thought he was the

5669.92 --> 5678.88
devil like they think they are they're

5674.0 --> 5678.88
like evil meal maniacal

5679.08 --> 5684.6
people or like they get all enthusiastic

5681.76 --> 5686.76
of like I'm secretly the devil like I'm

5684.6 --> 5688.76
going to play the mology oh are you

5686.76 --> 5692.8
going to think I'm the devil come at

5688.76 --> 5695.400000000001
me and then they throw hell at yeah cuz

5692.8 --> 5695.400000000001
they're [ __ ]

5704.6 --> 5709.56
evil what forced the line what are you

5707.159 --> 5709.5599999999995
talking

5720.4 --> 5723.4
about

5723.53 --> 5729.619
[Music]

5741.08 --> 5744.08
God

5750.4 --> 5753.4
what

5772.159 --> 5777.879999999999
okay that's all

5775.0 --> 5779.719
ridiculous like we don't need to do that

5777.88 --> 5783.56
at

5779.719 --> 5787.0
all oh no have the Black Swan arguments

5783.56 --> 5789.719
like the only way you can force the line

5787.0 --> 5793.04
is would be like oh so you mean you're

5789.719 --> 5796.92
going to accept refraction as a rebuttal

5793.04 --> 5798.639
then in order to have to do that uh no

5796.92 --> 5801.32
no you

5798.639 --> 5804.04
don't

5801.32 --> 5807.04
yeah refraction is not an argument it's

5804.04 --> 5809.44
not based in Optics it's a mathematical

5807.04 --> 5812.04
correction that assumes the radius of

5809.44 --> 5815.0
Earth within the mathematical

5812.04 --> 5818.639
formula it is a

5815.0 --> 5821.28
paradox CU if the Horizon is refracted

5818.639 --> 5824.88
which is what is assumed within that

5821.28 --> 5826.8
system then you can't establish the

5824.88 --> 5829.96
radius value of

5826.8 --> 5831.679
Earth at all because it's how are you

5829.96 --> 5833.719
going to do it when it's never where

5831.679 --> 5836.719
it's supposed to be you can't measure it

5833.719 --> 5839.119
then anymore so refraction is

5836.719 --> 5843.199
paradoxical it's the called the arnian

5839.119 --> 5843.199
Paradox even

5844.84 --> 5850.76
recognized by fed still that's what it

5856.8 --> 5863.08
is like either the globe claims

5860.32 --> 5864.5599999999995
that you can see the curvature and

5863.08 --> 5868.599
measure the curvature and that there is

5864.56 --> 5872.4800000000005
a drop because of the 8 in per M squared

5868.599 --> 5877.56
or whatever it is supposedly

5872.48 --> 5877.5599999999995
right either it's that or there is no

5878.52 --> 5883.4400000000005
Globe if you see a Black Swan

5881.36 --> 5885.32
observation and the a bottal is but

5883.44 --> 5888.0
refraction well then you don't have a

5885.32 --> 5888.0
globe claim

5888.56 --> 5892.1990000000005
anymore hello Shan

5900.119 --> 5903.119
G

5904.679 --> 5910.8
there's no Polaris type celestials in

5908.239 --> 5914.04
the South what what are you talking

5910.8 --> 5917.360000000001
about there's the Southern

5914.04 --> 5917.36
Cross it's

5929.199 --> 5936.08
there wow so oh money we got a seral

5932.88 --> 5939.52
projector on our hands

5936.08 --> 5939.5199999999995

out for the reemerging troll

5978.32 --> 5982.88
wanker That Never Ends his projections

5981.56 --> 5985.639
like

5982.88 --> 5988.119
literally every detail it's literally

5985.639 --> 5990.719
projection I mean if it wasn't

5988.119 --> 5991.5599999999995
projection it would be blatantly absurd

5990.719 --> 5993.52
but

5991.56 --> 5995.360000000001
I think he's too [ __ ] [ __ ] at

5993.52 --> 5998.159000000001
this point to even notice that about

5995.36 --> 6000.679
what he's saying but uh wrenches please

5998.159 --> 6000.679

there yes duper he

6143.92 --> 6149.36
does it's the go gotha [ __ ] demon got to

6152.88 --> 6158.4800000000005
him now he can't make the poop stop

6155.48 --> 6158.48
spouting out of his

6158.68 --> 6161.829000000001
[Music]

6162.44 --> 6166.48
mouth it's very tragic

6169.76 --> 6172.76
really

6175.159 --> 6178.759999999999
hell is flat do

6182.39 --> 6185.52
[Music]

6186.159 --> 6194.36
no no hell is Inc Caporal it's just the

6190.679 --> 6194.36
spirit there's no material

6198.639 --> 6206.08
there it doesn't have any or orentation

6201.639 --> 6206.08
it can be whatever it wants to

6229.679 --> 6234.68
be

6231.48 --> 6234.679999999999
[Music]

6244.82 --> 6247.969999999999
[Music]

6253.88 --> 6259.36
look I don't even know if hell in that

6257.199 --> 6261.799999999999
sense is

6259.36 --> 6267.04
real after

6261.8 --> 6269.28
life right but yeah we definitely don't

6267.04 --> 6269.28
like

6282.87 --> 6286.09
[Music]

6289.56 --> 6292.56
him

6301.4 --> 6306.0
and yeah I mean on the scale of things

6303.84 --> 6309.599
he does kind of deserve a remark like

6306.0 --> 6313.76
that but I tend to like

6309.599 --> 6313.76
not wish anything like

6314.84 --> 6320.08
that you

6317.36 --> 6322.199
know I'd like to rather see it as like

6320.08 --> 6325.4
oh if the somebody really terrible and

6322.199 --> 6327.719
they died it's like just thank God

6325.4 --> 6327.719
that's

6330.4 --> 6335.96
over because when you really honestly

6333.92 --> 6338.76
start to think about it those people

6335.96 --> 6342.32
probably got a pretty messed up life to

6338.76 --> 6345.400000000001
to do all those things in the first

6342.32 --> 6347.5599999999995
instance now of course sometimes there's

6345.4 --> 6349.638999999999
certain individuals that have gone so

6347.56 --> 6351.0
far it just literally doesn't matter

6349.639 --> 6353.639
anymore that

6351.0 --> 6358.239
maybe they were very unfortunate it's

6353.639 --> 6360.96
like no no just go away

6358.239 --> 6363.239
now people like Bill Gates it's like

6360.96 --> 6366.0
there is literally nothing anybody could

6363.239 --> 6367.718999999999
conceive of that would amount to some

6366.0 --> 6370.08
level of

6367.719 --> 6373.639
forgiveness for everything he's done

6370.08 --> 6377.5599999999995
it's like no he's made sure that there's

6373.639 --> 6380.1990000000005
absolutely no more wiggle room left to

6377.56 --> 6383.280000000001
to escape that hell that will inevitably

6380.199 --> 6386.638999999999
come to him in the end I mean if there's

6383.28 --> 6389.8
somebody going to hell or predition if

6386.639 --> 6393.36
you will it's going to be

6389.8 --> 6396.320000000001
him cuz he's literally asked for it like

6393.36 --> 6396.32
he has I know

6397.599 --> 6404.119000000001
it right but I really like the the

6401.599 --> 6406.92
Mormon way of looking at it and that is

6404.119 --> 6409.759999999999
that the real hell

6406.92 --> 6411.96
afterlife you can only go there if you

6409.76 --> 6415.159000000001
want to

6411.96 --> 6415.159
because you hate God so

6417.639 --> 6424.1990000000005
much and some of these people are so

6421.04 --> 6426.92
self-destructive so hateful so sick that

6424.199 --> 6426.919999999999
they do

6439.32 --> 6443.639
that

6441.88 --> 6445.76
people realize the truth of things when

6443.639 --> 6448.36
they die well blue pill

6445.76 --> 6450.280000000001
Evolution maybe I think there's like a

6448.36 --> 6453.159
transition process where you basically

6450.28 --> 6455.04
get to face everything I think that

6453.159 --> 6457.4
there's a good chance that when you die

6455.04 --> 6460.84
especially if it's all

6457.4 --> 6461.92
miserable that you get lifted out of

6460.84 --> 6464.4400000000005
that

6461.92 --> 6466.76
misery become clear and pure where

6464.44 --> 6469.4
you're really supposed to

6466.76 --> 6472.280000000001
be and then get to face everything

6469.4 --> 6475.5199999999995
you've done from that perspective from

6472.28 --> 6478.5199999999995
you as an actual innocent person as

6475.52 --> 6481.400000000001
would be the victims that you've caused

6478.52 --> 6486.280000000001
you would experience your own terrible

6481.4 --> 6489.638999999999
Deeds as your victim and feel like your

6486.28 --> 6491.759999999999
victim like experience that from a pure

6489.639 --> 6494.32
heart not from a corrupted heart which

6491.76 --> 6496.52
is what drove you to do those

6494.32 --> 6499.239
things right I think that that is

6496.52 --> 6502.2390000000005
something that

6499.239 --> 6502.239
happens

6514.0 --> 6520.22
oh it's rain in

6517.17 --> 6520.22
[Music]

6529.199 --> 6532.199
yuck

6536.44 --> 6540.759999999999
right but I mean there's all these

6538.8 --> 6543.04
considerations right and I'm talking

6540.76 --> 6545.1990000000005
we're talking about pure speculation now

6543.04 --> 6548.0
this is pretty

6545.199 --> 6550.199
much similar to what like the Catholics

6548.0 --> 6552.8
would have done right how they

6550.199 --> 6556.44
speculated about heaven and hell like

6552.8 --> 6558.679
it's literally made up by them literally

6556.44 --> 6560.719
maybe some mushrooms or whatever were

6558.679 --> 6563.32
involved in deriving some of the

6560.719 --> 6565.36
ideas I'm not talking about like the old

6563.32 --> 6567.759999999999
scripture

6565.36 --> 6569.5599999999995
stuff I'm like talking about Catholic

6567.76 --> 6572.599
works and all

6569.56 --> 6575.119000000001
that and yeah well maybe you could

6572.599 --> 6576.4800000000005
consider that in the afterlife it's like

6575.119 --> 6579.119
a

6576.48 --> 6582.799999999999
spectrum between Heaven and Hell and

6579.119 --> 6585.239
there's like no absolutely this

6582.8 --> 6587.08
absolutely that but that it is actually

6585.239 --> 6590.799999999999
like this

6587.08 --> 6594.639
weird spectrum of like combin

6590.8 --> 6597.599
of traits and frequencies bad and good

6594.639 --> 6599.92
that amount to like the after experience

6597.599 --> 6603.400000000001
like what it's going to be like and that

6599.92 --> 6605.719
to have a peak of either Heaven or Hell

6603.4 --> 6608.199
in its Purity is very

6605.719 --> 6611.52
rare right I mean we

6608.199 --> 6615.0
are very much

6611.52 --> 6617.8
like two of them the two the two pillars

6615.0 --> 6621.639
or something at The Good Side Bad Side

6617.8 --> 6623.96
and we struggle between them in life

6621.639 --> 6626.119
some more to One Direction some more to

6623.96 --> 6626.119
the

6627.36 --> 6633.28
other so if that is part of our struggle

6630.719 --> 6636.76
and our Alchemy then why would the

6633.28 --> 6640.5199999999995
afterlife be an absolute one and an

6636.76 --> 6640.52
absolute zero

6640.88 --> 6645.56
right anyway this is all just pure

6643.32 --> 6648.799999999999
speculation it's not based on anything

6645.56 --> 6652.04
or any lore or whatever it's that's why

6648.8 --> 6652.04
it's pure speculation

6653.03 --> 6659.4
[Music]

6657.92 --> 6662.1990000000005
I think in

6659.4 --> 6665.44
reality nobody really

6662.199 --> 6668.759999999999
knows and I don't think anybody can find

6665.44 --> 6671.799999999999
out and I think that actually finding

6668.76 --> 6674.599
out could potentially like destroy the

6671.8 --> 6678.2390000000005
entire purpose of the world of our

6674.599 --> 6680.719
existing here if we knew if we truly

6678.239 --> 6683.598999999999
knew but I think that the demons are

6680.719 --> 6685.92
have vested interest in trying to make

6683.599 --> 6685.92
us

6686.719 --> 6692.4800000000005
believe make us believe that we know and

6689.719 --> 6694.76
thereby imprinting their illusions of

6692.48 --> 6697.5599999999995
what we're going to end up assuming will

6694.76 --> 6701.679
happen and I think that that

6697.56 --> 6704.96
is a big part of like what's happening

6701.679 --> 6708.04
in universally with all

6704.96 --> 6710.639
humans that's how Christianity has

6708.04 --> 6713.679
become so corrupted

6710.639 --> 6716.119
just a Cascade of human assumptions

6713.679 --> 6719.679
about things they don't really

6716.119 --> 6722.5599999999995
know who gave them those

6719.679 --> 6724.679
ideas what does the influence of all

6722.56 --> 6727.119000000001
those ideas amount to what has happened

6724.679 --> 6730.28
to all those people that have just per

6727.119 --> 6732.679
default believed in all of it yeah it

6730.28 --> 6736.4
all seems quite

6732.679 --> 6736.4
demonic yeah all these

6738.88 --> 6741.88
assumptions

6747.599 --> 6757.1990000000005

6903.84 --> 6911.119000000001
beyond the geometric limitation that the

6907.599 --> 6914.639
globe Earth with its assumed size would

6911.119 --> 6917.88
have right which would typically happen

6914.639 --> 6921.04
when you like take a real low

6917.88 --> 6923.719
observation height like really low to

6921.04 --> 6925.119
the ocean like right on top of it oh if

6923.719 --> 6929.4
you didn't

6925.119 --> 6932.88
see like the Horizon is like very far

6929.4 --> 6935.4
away how can that happen if it's curved

6932.88 --> 6938.159000000001
yeah it can't that's why it's called a

6935.4 --> 6941.4
Black Swan observation because the

6938.159 --> 6947.719
observations with just regular

6941.4 --> 6947.719
sight definitely violate the curvature

6948.04 --> 6952.28
limitation of where the hor Horizon

6950.0 --> 6952.28
should

6952.32 --> 6957.5599999999995
be

6954.52 --> 6960.76
yeah or colloquially I know it's not

6957.56 --> 6964.84
very popular in fed to say it like that

6960.76 --> 6967.679
if you see too far no more

6964.84 --> 6971.679
Globe we can see too

6967.679 --> 6974.84
far yeah we can see the Horizon being

6971.679 --> 6976.92
much further away than the geometry of

6974.84 --> 6979.84
globe Earth would

6976.92 --> 6982.52
allow yeah Black Swan it's not that

6979.84 --> 6984.8
Globe the geometry has been

6982.52 --> 6987.1990000000005
violated Earth is

6984.8 --> 6991.84
flat observed

[Music]

7001.52 --> 7006.88
flat

7003.04 --> 7009.96
Architects design their buildings

7006.88 --> 7012.679
flat yeah whether they're building on

7009.96 --> 7018.199
the side of a mountain or over a flat

7012.679 --> 7022.04
plane or a bridge on the ocean it's all

7018.199 --> 7025.04
flat there's no accountant for curvature

7022.04 --> 7027.719
in any form when it comes to the

7025.04 --> 7030.96
foundation of buildings which are

7027.719 --> 7030.96
specifically designed

is

7073.68 --> 7078.329000000001
[Music]

7098.32 --> 7104.44
for the tolerances in construction are

7101.88 --> 7107.52
greater than the curve of the earth what

7104.44 --> 7107.5199999999995
the [ __ ] does that even

7111.04 --> 7114.04
mean

7121.119 --> 7126.239
what are you claiming Earth too

7128.32 --> 7131.32
biggie

7132.96 --> 7139.44
it's like oh man no we could just like

7135.639 --> 7143.119
be off about the curve of the earth a

7139.44 --> 7143.119
lot could just do

7152.88 --> 7158.2390000000005
that more than the tolerance in

7155.36 --> 7161.239
construction like what a weird thing to

7158.239 --> 7161.239
say

7184.91 --> 7192.0599999999995
[Music]

7203.48 --> 7208.5599999999995
all right but I mean that's what flat

7205.56 --> 7208.56
earthers have to deal

7210.52 --> 7218.159000000001
with people that just keep doubling down

7213.88 --> 7220.1990000000005
Forever on blatantly disproven

7218.159 --> 7223.679
things

7220.199 --> 7223.678999999999
and they'll just keep going and

7225.28 --> 7230.04
going see and now it's like trying to

7227.52 --> 7232.639
reduce it all back it's like oh just

7230.04 --> 7234.44
don't listen to anything it's like oh

7232.639 --> 7237.639
you think that that one building

7234.44 --> 7240.638999999999
disproves it no no no we think that

7237.639 --> 7240.639
everything disproves

7240.84 --> 7247.4400000000005
it like all

7244.0 --> 7250.239
architecture like all architectural

7247.44 --> 7253.079
plans yeah there's no architect in the

7250.239 --> 7256.079
world that has ever taken into account

7253.079 --> 7258.92
the curvature of

7256.079 --> 7261.84
Earth because they all build on flat

7258.92 --> 7264.52
foundations and when they get their

7261.84 --> 7267.04
schematics yeah the schematics for the

7264.52 --> 7271.280000000001
architecture of a building yeah guess

7267.04 --> 7274.44
what they do it on on a flat plane the

7271.28 --> 7274.44
side view flat

7274.8 --> 7281.1990000000005
plane top down nice flat plane side view

7279.36 --> 7286.598999999999
nice flat plane

7281.199 --> 7290.36
flat all Architects design on a flat

7286.599 --> 7290.360000000001
plane it is what it

7298.48 --> 7304.32
is but hey if you can find me some

7301.079 --> 7306.96
schematics of an

7304.32 --> 7309.599
architecture that was with the

7306.96 --> 7314.56
blueprints where the blueprints are like

7309.599 --> 7317.04
using a curved Foundation of Earth as a

7314.56 --> 7321.1990000000005
vantage point for the architecture I'd

7317.04 --> 7324.0
love to see that but make it not a

7321.199 --> 7327.079
hypothetical thing but an actual

7324.0 --> 7330.199
blueprint of a building that has been

7327.079 --> 7332.28
built yes not a hypothetical stupid

7330.199 --> 7334.759999999999
little magical thing that you made that

7332.28 --> 7336.44
doesn't actually exist an actual

7334.76 --> 7337.96
building show me a blueprint of an

7336.44 --> 7339.5199999999995
actual

7337.96 --> 7342.04
building

7339.52 --> 7346.320000000001
it is blatantly designed by the

7342.04 --> 7347.239
architect on a curved surface yeah they

7346.32 --> 7350.239
don't

7347.239 --> 7350.239
exist

7354.48 --> 7359.32
zero construction

7356.679 --> 7362.0
tolerances yeah we don't need to take

7359.32 --> 7364.36
care of yeah I know but nobody does take

7362.0 --> 7367.96
it into account though even the really

7364.36 --> 7369.639
long big buildings like international

7367.96 --> 7372.44
airports

7369.639 --> 7375.119
yeah they're very big like sometimes

7372.44 --> 7379.0
they're like miles

7375.119 --> 7382.799999999999
across yeah none of them take into

7379.0 --> 7386.56
account any form of curvature and the

7382.8 --> 7389.159000000001
tolerance for that for like miles long

7386.56 --> 7392.1990000000005
buildings yeah it's not that great on a

7389.159 --> 7395.759999999999
curved Earth yeah you you can't really

7392.199 --> 7399.919999999999
deviate that much before like the whole

7395.76 --> 7402.679
thing simply collapses in on itself

7399.92 --> 7405.4400000000005
so you can make that excuse with smaller

7402.679 --> 7406.599
buildings sure but bigger buildings no

7405.44 --> 7409.5599999999995
you

7406.599 --> 7412.32
cannot now they are definitely built on

7409.56 --> 7412.320000000001
a flat

7415.8 --> 7419.92
plane so keep chanting the same horeshit

7418.44 --> 7422.079
over and over again and it'll just kick

7419.92 --> 7422.079
you

7427.88 --> 7430.88
out

7436.92 --> 7443.92
London Underground

7439.559 --> 7443.92
extensions no they did not

7457.8 --> 7460.8
liar

7462.639 --> 7467.079
construction tolerance is

7464.599 --> 7470.2390000000005
used yeah but I

7467.079 --> 7472.719
mean to then move it off to an obvious

7470.239 --> 7476.5199999999995
other thing I mean this we're dealing

7472.719 --> 7479.4800000000005
with a balard [ __ ] here who is nothing

7476.52 --> 7482.96
to do in his life but like gather giant

7479.48 --> 7485.919999999999
piles of nonsense arguments and excuses

7482.96 --> 7487.76
to justify why the Earth is in the

7485.92 --> 7490.76
globe

7487.76 --> 7490.76
right

7491.8 --> 7495.400000000001
like white supposed to be a globe when

7493.599 --> 7499.2390000000005
nothing actually points at it being a

7495.4 --> 7501.96
globe so this is what he's going to

7499.239 --> 7505.159
do but I mean him even saying oh

7501.96 --> 7508.679
tolerances it's it's that's just a

7505.159 --> 7511.92
lie yeah that's a

7508.679 --> 7515.28
lie there is no

7511.92 --> 7518.719
tolerances like that

7515.28 --> 7521.5199999999995
yeah like deviation tolerance within AR

7518.719 --> 7523.4
architecture is extremely low yeah the

7521.52 --> 7525.96
the standards are high especially the

7523.4 --> 7528.638999999999
big buildings because one part just

7525.96 --> 7532.84
slight deviation it will wreck the whole

7528.639 --> 7537.079
thing yeah tolerance limits are very

7532.84 --> 7540.88
low in in buildings when it comes to

7537.079 --> 7545.799999999999
deviations so it's just a madeup

7540.88 --> 7549.599
horeshit lie a balart [ __ ] with lie a

7545.8 --> 7551.639
desperate Lie by a liar who make [ __ ] up

7549.599 --> 7553.159000000001
to justify why things aren't the way

7551.639 --> 7556.159000000001
that they

7553.159 --> 7556.159
believe

7557.0 --> 7560.0
yeah

7567.84 --> 7577.28
WS yeah if that compounds yeah if that

7572.559 --> 7581.63
compounds yeah yeah you do see it's not

7577.28 --> 7583.4
just a 100 met wall we're talking

7581.63 --> 7588.52
[Music]

7583.4 --> 7590.92
about 10,000 M wall it's going to

7588.52 --> 7592.400000000001
compound yeah especially if it's a

7590.92 --> 7595.4
singular

7592.4 --> 7598.638999999999
building when there's a roof on top the

7595.4 --> 7602.719
roof is going to be flat measured

7598.639 --> 7605.88
flat it doesn't curve around the

7602.719 --> 7605.88
building around the

7607.599 --> 7612.639
Earth

7610.04 --> 7615.32
wooden compound oh yes yeah it's all the

7612.639 --> 7618.1990000000005
Earth is too big you don't ever take

7615.32 --> 7622.36
into account except you continually

7618.199 --> 7622.36
do you're using a flat

7624.92 --> 7631.04
Foundation yeah in the

7626.88 --> 7634.639
schematics zon view of the

7631.04 --> 7637.159
architecture the Earth is flat the

7634.639 --> 7640.2390000000005
foundation that they make is

7637.159 --> 7642.04
flat yeah and then the building right

7640.239 --> 7646.44
next to

7642.04 --> 7648.239
it that's just as big yeah it's it's not

7646.44 --> 7651.32
slanted

7648.239 --> 7654.48
slightly yeah it's just perfectly

7651.32 --> 7656.719
parallel it's not slanted cuz the Earth

7654.48 --> 7660.04
isn't curving over a distance they don't

7656.719 --> 7661.96
just oh we have to average out this

7660.04 --> 7664.48
curve part so we're just going to like

7661.96 --> 7666.36
dig it and make it kind of flat and then

7664.48 --> 7669.558999999999
right beside it is a

7666.36 --> 7670.88
slightly slanted building

7669.559 --> 7673.52
because it's a little bit further down

7670.88 --> 7676.639
the Cur now that's now nobody in this

7673.52 --> 7678.119000000001
world ever builds and has ever built

7676.639 --> 7683.32
because the Earth is

7678.119 --> 7683.32
flat it's measured and built on

7697.44 --> 7700.44
flat

7705.76 --> 7708.0
yes

7722.639 --> 7728.92
sir yeah how about the vertical

7724.8 --> 7732.2390000000005
tolerance eh WS you know how how high

7728.92 --> 7735.2390000000005
that's that the line building is you

7732.239 --> 7735.239
know how high it

7740.28 --> 7745.32
is there's not a lot of Tolerance right

7742.599 --> 7750.119000000001
I mean if you have a building or a wall

7745.32 --> 7752.599
if you say that like one floor High then

7750.119 --> 7755.0
yeah I don't know it they can even be

7752.599 --> 7757.32
like a DT in the road and like the walls

7755.0 --> 7760.599
just like slightly like that right but I

7757.32 --> 7763.36
mean if you have like a

7760.599 --> 7766.360000000001
2050 story

7763.36 --> 7770.558999999999
building that tolerance limit at the

7766.36 --> 7772.48
bottom is going to be absolutely

7770.559 --> 7776.52
minute

7772.48 --> 7779.36
because every half like quarter a tenth

7776.52 --> 7783.599
of a millimeter it's off it's like yeah

7779.36 --> 7787.32
that compounds upward a

7783.599 --> 7790.32
lot it becomes

7787.32 --> 7790.32
problematic

7794.0 --> 7800.32
so yeah Architects design their

7796.599 --> 7800.32
buildings on a flat

7803.4 --> 7809.04
Earth yeah so there might be some

7805.96 --> 7811.679
supposed tolerance limits but I mean the

7809.04 --> 7814.4
plans they use and they draw out are on

7811.679 --> 7816.84
a flat Earth and they don't take into

7814.4 --> 7819.4
account a

7816.84 --> 7821.599
curve and they don't think about

7819.4 --> 7824.44
tolerance limmit of dealing with the

7821.599 --> 7828.119000000001
Curve because there is no Cur and they

7824.44 --> 7831.839999999999
design their buildings on a flat

7828.119 --> 7832.759999999999
Earth if it's on a hill or on the side

7831.84 --> 7835.079
of a

7832.76 --> 7837.2390000000005
mountain then they have to build a

7835.079 --> 7839.759999999999
foundation and maybe carve a piece out

7837.239 --> 7841.04
to make the bottom the foundation for

7839.76 --> 7843.52
the building that they are going to

7841.04 --> 7845.119
build

7843.52 --> 7847.92
flat

7845.119 --> 7850.199
because you can only really build

7847.92 --> 7852.559
anything on a flat

7850.199 --> 7856.638999999999
earth right and if the Earth isn't like

7852.559 --> 7860.559
perfectly flat then you have to make it

7856.639 --> 7862.4800000000005
flat because if you build on a curved

7860.559 --> 7866.52
surface or even on the side of a

7862.48 --> 7870.239
mountain like yeah that's risky it'll

7866.52 --> 7872.92
start sliding off you have to use a flat

7870.239 --> 7875.32
bottom as a good foundation for any

7872.92 --> 7879.4
building or it will risk

7875.32 --> 7880.28
collapsing that's bad for insurance

7879.4 --> 7883.598999999999
doesn't

7880.28 --> 7886.719
sell Architects build on a flat

7883.599 --> 7889.32

7886.719 --> 7889.32

7889.639 --> 7895.92
Foundation tolerances no no I

7892.84 --> 7898.4800000000005

7895.92 --> 7902.599

7962.84 --> 7968.400000000001
they definitely aren't referring to

7965.119 --> 7971.199
level because if you don't get that that

7968.4 --> 7972.96
right in your architecture you're [ __ ]

7971.199 --> 7974.159
the entire building's going to collapse

7972.96 --> 7977.119
as I already

7974.159 --> 7979.48
explained I know how tolerances kind of

7977.119 --> 7980.759999999999
work when it comes to like deviations

7979.48 --> 7983.598999999999
that's what it's all

7980.76 --> 7985.84
about that you can't build a flat

7983.599 --> 7989.4400000000005
building on a curved

7985.84 --> 7991.52
surface it doesn't

7989.44 --> 7993.96
work because they don't build on a

7991.52 --> 7996.679
curved surface they build flat buildings

7993.96 --> 8000.0
on a flat plane

7996.679 --> 8004.0
Foundation that's how it's designed and

8000.0 --> 8008.079
tolerances have no relevance to

8004.0 --> 8008.079
that they build on a flat

8009.88 --> 8015.96
plane yeah it's in all Dimensions I

8013.04 --> 8018.119
know and it's designed on a flat plane

8015.96 --> 8020.599
and it's going to be built on a flat

8018.119 --> 8022.639
plane and if you don't build on a flat

8020.599 --> 8025.04
plane then you don't have a building

8022.639 --> 8028.0
it's going to

8025.04 --> 8030.28
collapse or going to like balance on a

8028.0 --> 8032.76
widget in the middle and that doesn't

8030.28 --> 8032.759999999999
make any

8033.48 --> 8039.959999999999
sense nobody wants a building in which

8036.4 --> 8039.96
the floors aren't

8045.8 --> 8051.079000000001
level hardly big oh it's not good enough

8048.76 --> 8053.400000000001
dude why don't you keep repeating that

8051.079 --> 8056.36
crap another 10 minutes I'll [ __ ]

8053.4 --> 8058.638999999999
kick you out spamming the same horeshit

8056.36 --> 8061.4
over and over again I mean it's already

8058.639 --> 8063.52
on screen yeah I don't need you in the

8061.4 --> 8065.719
chat spamming the same horse [ __ ] over

8063.52 --> 8068.4800000000005
and over again I can just kick you out

8065.719 --> 8070.84
now do you understand

8068.48 --> 8072.959999999999
that so why don't you keep spamming the

8070.84 --> 8077.84
same horeshit and I'm going to kick you

8072.96 --> 8077.84
out now get an argument or get the [ __ ]

8081.47 --> 8085.43
[Music]

8086.88 --> 8095.34
out

8088.15 --> 8095.339999999999
[Music]

8105.16 --> 8109.04
[Music]

8106.599 --> 8111.360000000001
yeah I don't care what he thinks it's

8109.04 --> 8113.48
just the same hor [ __ ] arguments

8111.36 --> 8116.839999999999
tolerances [ __ ]

8113.48 --> 8119.239
off Earth is flat measured flat

8116.84 --> 8122.28
calculated flat navigated

8119.239 --> 8125.919999999999
flat built on

8122.28 --> 8129.119
flat architecture blueprints are

8125.92 --> 8132.4
flat no add wrestle whatsoever just

8129.119 --> 8134.799999999999
tolerance tolerance oh they don't it's

8132.4 --> 8136.96
within tolerance limits oh what the

8134.8 --> 8140.04
Earth being curved is within tolerance

8136.96 --> 8141.639
limits oh sure yeah yeah the Earth being

8140.04 --> 8145.96
curved in your assumption is within

8141.639 --> 8145.96
tolerance limits on the flat plane I'm

8146.8 --> 8149.8
sure

8150.52 --> 8154.02
[Music]

8154.8 --> 8158.719
right don't forget to Rogan it up

8160.28 --> 8166.759999999999
guys come

8162.76 --> 8166.76
on don't keep me hanging

8170.76 --> 8179.320000000001
here ah I got seven I just needed to

8174.639 --> 8181.559
refresh okay good he shut up finally

8179.32 --> 8184.719
was really getting tired of seeing the

8181.559 --> 8184.719
same thing over and over

8188.88 --> 8198.479
again what's the point of a bubble in a

8192.96 --> 8202.0
level uh well so you can

8198.479 --> 8202.0
establish if it is

8206.679 --> 8213.24
level I don't care a lady oh my

8224.92 --> 8231.76
God you mean planer

8227.639 --> 8231.759999999998
Walker oh my God I hope

8232.0 --> 8239.599
not Brenda no it doesn't sound like

8236.599 --> 8239.599
Brenda

8241.679 --> 8247.24
no no Brenda doesn't talk like that if

8245.519 --> 8248.76
it was Brenda there would have been she

8247.24 --> 8252.88
would have virtual signal that it was

8248.76 --> 8255.880000000001
Brenda already because once Brenda

8252.88 --> 8258.358999999999
gets triggered or whatever like she

8255.88 --> 8260.358999999999
immediately lets her guard down she

8258.359 --> 8262.519
immediately wants to show that it's her

8260.359 --> 8266.08
and it's not

8262.519 --> 8266.08
her her him

8266.599 --> 8269.599
whatever

8270.92 --> 8277.04
Rogan see what I did there dude I've

8273.439 --> 8278.679
said Rogan since since Owen Benjamin

8277.04 --> 8281.439
brought it first

8278.679 --> 8285.0
up like I've been saying Rogan's it up

8281.439 --> 8285.0
for how many years now

8285.12 --> 8289.359
guys must be at least four

8290.2 --> 8294.880000000001
years but I mean I like it I like saying

8296.519 --> 8299.519
that

8301.439 --> 8305.24
right and here you actually have thumbs

8303.92 --> 8307.8
on YouTube I

8305.24 --> 8310.559
mean you don't have yeah Owen's not on

8307.8 --> 8315.039999999999
here anymore but I can still say it and

8310.559 --> 8315.039999999999
I do I do it every show Rogan's it

8317.24 --> 8323.92
up right and I mean I'm not even that

8320.28 --> 8326.800000000001
much against Rogan anymore although he's

8323.92 --> 8329.519
still just like another Shield really

8326.8 --> 8329.518999999998
but

8331.08 --> 8333.96
I just like to say

8341.059 --> 8344.217999999999
[Music]

8346.479 --> 8353.479
it yes Loop Evolution but I mean brand

8349.719 --> 8356.759999999998
has a very specific signature of how she

8353.479 --> 8360.719
talks like I'll recognize Brena within

8356.76 --> 8362.960000000001
two sentences usually really but because

8360.719 --> 8364.839999999998
it's I've been facing that woman even

8362.96 --> 8367.279999999999
trying to infiltrate my chat and all

8364.84 --> 8369.599
that for years she doesn't do that

8367.28 --> 8372.679
anymore she's given up

8369.599 --> 8375.679
finally right but I mean Brenda is like

8372.679 --> 8377.399
one of the most identifiable people on

8375.679 --> 8381.0
the

8377.399 --> 8382.92
internet like she could be completely

8381.0 --> 8386.439
Anonymous I'll still be able to figure

8382.92 --> 8388.12
it out it's her like in two

8386.439 --> 8390.68
sentences

8388.12 --> 8392.6
[Music]

8390.68 --> 8394.399
share

8392.6 --> 8397.92
concept I don't

8394.399 --> 8401.279999999999
know I don't care to speculate about her

8397.92 --> 8401.28
private life at all

8402.6 --> 8406.16
thanks hey random

8416.359 --> 8421.24
Explorer

8418.28 --> 8421.24
almost four

8436.72 --> 8443.64
what the thumbs up are the Rogan up are

8439.84 --> 8443.64
at seven now as far as I can

8444.12 --> 8451.12
see oh 10 wow okay that was good

8448.359 --> 8454.439
quick it doesn't seem to really live

8451.12 --> 8458.720000000001
update I have to

8454.439 --> 8461.960000000001
refresh but uh that's good thanks thanks

8458.72 --> 8464.119999999999
everybody for supporting the stream in

8461.96 --> 8466.119999999999
spirit with the thumbs up or the Rogan

8464.12 --> 8467.439
up I appreciate that it's been an

8466.12 --> 8469.76
interesting

8467.439 --> 8472.399
show

8469.76 --> 8475.68
fluid different subjects very

8472.399 --> 8475.68
contrasting subjects

8476.24 --> 8479.24
though

8488.76 --> 8495.6
Joe and a twinter intervention for

8492.46 --> 8495.599999999999
[Music]

8499.68 --> 8509.24
yeah no but I mean Joe is obviously like

8503.439 --> 8509.24
just playing games and [ __ ]

8510.96 --> 8513.919999999998
doing narrative

8515.28 --> 8520.24
deals right there there's this whole

8517.8 --> 8523.599999999999
program of all this like firus

8520.24 --> 8525.76
reinforcement of that it just just

8523.6 --> 8528.16
people talking about it speculating oh

8525.76 --> 8530.479
forbidden speculation about the virus

8528.16 --> 8533.039999999999
and what it's supposedly done and I'm

8530.479 --> 8536.399
like uh yeah it's all made up hor [ __ ]

8533.04 --> 8539.12
everything about it like the very

8536.399 --> 8541.119999999999
Foundation of it is completely made up

8539.12 --> 8543.240000000002
it's not even about what happened or

8541.12 --> 8546.319000000001
didn't happen it's about none of that

8543.24 --> 8549.8
exists and can exist and ever will exist

8546.319 --> 8553.64
it's all made up completely made up like

8549.8 --> 8557.599999999999
the entire field is completely made

8553.64 --> 8559.88
up what they do

8557.6 --> 8561.399000000001
like they they're probably doing

8559.88 --> 8564.438999999998
something but I

8561.399 --> 8566.358999999999
mean it doesn't amount to anything that

8564.439 --> 8567.720000000001
has anything to do with the model that

8566.359 --> 8570.399000000001
they claim

8567.72 --> 8572.479
that they're doing it's just bunch of

8570.399 --> 8574.76
poison it's all just bunch of poison

8572.479 --> 8576.84
working with poison oh we poison

8574.76 --> 8579.880000000001
something then we figure out what it

8576.84 --> 8582.04
does and that's it that's all it is all

8579.88 --> 8582.039999999999
of

8584.08 --> 8590.6
it and yeah there's people out there now

8586.68 --> 8592.800000000001
oh well what they did and it's all it's

8590.6 --> 8595.359
all narrative enforcement like the

8592.8 --> 8598.16
supposed resistance against the Batman

8595.359 --> 8602.0
that gave you the Jabs yeah well they

8598.16 --> 8605.52
are there to keep reinforcing the belief

8602.0 --> 8607.96
that any of it is real at all like oh

8605.52 --> 8611.640000000001
but oh the virus wasn't really that

8607.96 --> 8613.519999999999
dangerous there is no virus like any

8611.64 --> 8616.72
like not saying that that doesn't exist

8613.52 --> 8619.24
I'm not saying that viruses exist at all

8616.72 --> 8621.039999999999
like the entire concept of a virus is

8619.24 --> 8624.319
science fiction and there's no physical

8621.04 --> 8627.12
evidence for it yeah the procedure that

8624.319 --> 8629.84
supposedly shows you what a virus is is

8627.12 --> 8629.84
is

8630.64 --> 8637.439
ridiculous like if you allow to let the

8634.8 --> 8639.96
information on that into your mind and

8637.439 --> 8643.399
critically think about it you realize

8639.96 --> 8645.96
like that's a freaking magician's trick

8643.399 --> 8650.399
if you believe that that proves viruses

8645.96 --> 8654.039999999999
are real you are too dumb to survive now

8650.399 --> 8656.0
that's not fair it is a higher level

8654.04 --> 8659.0
wizard trick but I mean it

8656.0 --> 8659.0
is

8659.439 --> 8665.479000000001
there's no evidence at

8662.88 --> 8669.64
all

8665.479 --> 8672.319
just don't put anything through a needle

8669.64 --> 8674.119999999999
in your arm and you should mostly be all

8672.319 --> 8675.68
right I mean it's it's pretty much that

8674.12 --> 8679.2
simple at this

8675.68 --> 8680.399
point like keep yourself well fed and

8679.2 --> 8682.84
you'll be

8680.399 --> 8685.64
fine there's nothing to fear there's

8682.84 --> 8688.359
nothing that's going to float over and

8685.64 --> 8691.358999999999
and like oh borrow your their way into

8688.359 --> 8693.12
it right unless it's like an insect or

8691.359 --> 8695.479000000001
something I mean there are parasites

8693.12 --> 8699.359
there are like small creatures and blood

8695.479 --> 8701.84
parasite there are things

8699.359 --> 8705.52
but that's

8701.84 --> 8708.08
Regional and

8705.52 --> 8709.720000000001
curable and if you're really healthy

8708.08 --> 8711.52
then a lot of it like doesn't even stand

8709.72 --> 8713.96
a chance it can't even get its way into

8711.52 --> 8718.76
your show or into your system

8713.96 --> 8720.358999999999
so but but this supposed micro thingy

8718.76 --> 8722.84
smaller than a

8720.359 --> 8725.08
cell that does all these things it's

8722.84 --> 8728.6
complete science fiction it just doesn't

8725.08 --> 8731.96
exist and that's final I

8728.6 --> 8734.439
mean I have no more doubts left in my

8731.96 --> 8736.319
mind whatsoever that that is like one of

8734.439 --> 8739.92
the biggest science fiction projects

8736.319 --> 8744.76
arguably as big as nukes

8739.92 --> 8749.279
itself yeah nukes are fake too viruses

8744.76 --> 8751.08
are fake too like these are fake fake

8749.279 --> 8756.08
Armageddon

8751.08 --> 8758.76
stories it's a fake Armageddon story a

8756.08 --> 8762.399
fake terrifying

8758.76 --> 8764.08
danger nukes fake I mean bombs exist

8762.399 --> 8767.16
don't worry about that things can blow

8764.08 --> 8769.56
the hell up yeah and they can fry you

8767.16 --> 8771.08
with fire bombs it can be horrifying

8769.56 --> 8774.278999999999
things oh don't worry it's all

8771.08 --> 8776.359
horrifying hell on Earth you can get it

8774.279 --> 8779.2
yeah millions of people could just die

8776.359 --> 8780.52
like that oh for sure but there's no

8779.2 --> 8783.84
nukes

8780.52 --> 8785.92
though that thing does not exist that's

8783.84 --> 8787.8
science fiction it always was it's been

8785.92 --> 8790.359
reinforced through science fiction on

8787.8 --> 8793.599999999999
media and television for a century it

8790.359 --> 8796.960000000001
doesn't exist people were killed

8793.6 --> 8799.720000000001
journalists were killed at the

8796.96 --> 8803.399
time of when nukes were getting

8799.72 --> 8806.319
developed and unveiled they were killed

8803.399 --> 8809.319
for speaking out about how they had

8806.319 --> 8814.64
doubts about whether that was real yeah

8809.319 --> 8818.96
they were killed by agents in the

8814.64 --> 8822.24
government journalists in America were

8818.96 --> 8824.438999999998
killed by people in government for

8822.24 --> 8827.92
speaking out about having doubts that

8824.439 --> 8831.479000000001
they existed yeah oh yeah that's

8827.92 --> 8833.88
perfectly normal oh yes no wait oh if it

8831.479 --> 8836.199999999999
really was a really terrifying weapon

8833.88 --> 8837.679999999998
you kind of would want to spread rumors

8836.2 --> 8839.399000000001
that maybe it's

8837.68 --> 8842.279
fake

8839.399 --> 8845.119999999999
yeah you want to se confusion because

8842.279 --> 8847.6
confusion is the best barrier between

8845.12 --> 8850.439
your opponent trying to attain such

8847.6 --> 8852.800000000001
information and the actual information

8850.439 --> 8854.56
you wouldn't kill off people that had

8852.8 --> 8856.8
doubts about that it was real you would

8854.56 --> 8859.479
want to have them around yeah you only

8856.8 --> 8862.479
kill them off when it's actually

8859.479 --> 8864.08
fake yeah they're fake nukes are fake

8862.479 --> 8868.679999999998
and so are

8864.08 --> 8868.68
viruses completely made up

8870.02 --> 8873.92
[Music]

8871.359 --> 8875.76
yeah there's no particles from the

8873.92 --> 8877.92
outside that are going to get into your

8875.76 --> 8880.880000000001
system and take you

8877.92 --> 8883.84
over yeah

8880.88 --> 8887.199999999999
poison poison May kill

8883.84 --> 8889.56
you heavy carcinogens and especially

8887.2 --> 8892.68
compounded carcinogens like different

8889.56 --> 8895.439
influences from different directions can

8892.68 --> 8897.800000000001
wear you down where eventually your body

8895.439 --> 8900.279
will just not be able to repair itself

8897.8 --> 8902.96
properly go on the lowest tier of

8900.279 --> 8906.04
functioning and then just break

8902.96 --> 8908.08
down like things in your system will

8906.04 --> 8910.2
grow out of control like they are not

8908.08 --> 8913.279
properly managed

8910.2 --> 8916.92
anymore yeah so then you get cancer or

8913.279 --> 8918.92
you get some other terrible NeverEnding

8916.92 --> 8923.2
inflammation or whatever but the point

8918.92 --> 8926.319
is is that that's all your own system

8923.2 --> 8930.08
that's all in your system that then

8926.319 --> 8934.039999999999
grows out of control because of cartic

8930.08 --> 8937.12
influences toxic influence poison yeah

8934.04 --> 8941.240000000002
provable poison substance not

8937.12 --> 8941.240000000002
creatures that infiltrate

8941.319 --> 8945.56
you it's inanimate substance that does

8944.6 --> 8949.92
that

8945.56 --> 8949.92
damage not living

8950.64 --> 8956.08
things yeah the living

8953.24 --> 8957.119999999999
things might parasite in you that will

8956.08 --> 8958.92
be very

8957.12 --> 8962.04
provable cuz they have to be

8958.92 --> 8964.72
multicellular organisms there's yeah or

8962.04 --> 8966.960000000001
well there are like bacteria that's sort

8964.72 --> 8969.199999999999
of do that the point is is that they're

8966.96 --> 8971.519999999999
provably creatures they you can have

8969.2 --> 8973.2
them under a microscope detect them and

8971.52 --> 8975.880000000001
then see like hey there's

8973.2 --> 8978.880000000001
there

8975.88 --> 8980.8
right so yeah but they're like

8978.88 --> 8983.759999999998
technically considered parasites a lot

8980.8 --> 8985.519999999999
of them they are bigger than just a

8983.76 --> 8987.800000000001
regular

8985.52 --> 8989.800000000001
cell

8987.8 --> 8993.56
viruses though never been seen under a

8989.8 --> 8997.119999999999
microscope not once ever in history of

8993.56 --> 9002.68
mankind in history of virology history

8997.12 --> 9005.319000000001
of biology never has anybody ever seen a

9002.68 --> 9009.2
virus because it's a made up

9005.319 --> 9013.479
Concept in a procedure that reveals the

9009.2 --> 9016.279
supposed virus in anything is a

9013.479 --> 9019.08
ridiculous ridiculous markup process

9016.279 --> 9022.279
that you should see like that's makes no

9019.08 --> 9024.96
damn sense yeah you don't take that

9022.279 --> 9029.92
material

9024.96 --> 9032.72
like like grind up material to grind up

9029.92 --> 9035.399
any sort of material and like add

9032.72 --> 9041.08
poisons to it and then expect something

9035.399 --> 9044.599999999999
to emerge from that naturally is totally

9041.08 --> 9044.6
insane there's no

9045.439 --> 9048.439
way

9048.96 --> 9052.519999999999
whoa just had a weird ad with

9053.56 --> 9062.64
a with a question stuck to it that was

9056.96 --> 9065.599999999999
weird all right so fake things fake

9062.64 --> 9067.76
things that rule the minds of the masses

9065.6 --> 9071.0
with

9067.76 --> 9074.6
fear a lot of these fearful things are

9071.0 --> 9078.359
completely made up again

9074.6 --> 9078.359
Satan yeah lying

9079.0 --> 9087.319
people fear

9081.8 --> 9090.119999999999
things that literally provably don't

9087.319 --> 9092.479
exist and they'll attack each other for

9090.12 --> 9094.479000000001
claiming that it doesn't exist or

9092.479 --> 9098.16
they'll ban you or

9094.479 --> 9100.88
something right because you can shout

9098.16 --> 9104.64
all day long about how terrifying

9100.88 --> 9108.0
something is could do it on any platform

9104.64 --> 9111.08
so scared of this that's a absolutely

9108.0 --> 9112.76
fine they love it they'll get all the

9111.08 --> 9115.8
viewers you get all the channels you get

9112.76 --> 9117.84
all the like oh all the attention yeah

9115.8 --> 9120.119999999999
because you are a like a

9117.84 --> 9123.279
panicking

9120.12 --> 9125.319000000001
little piece of cattle they love that

9123.279 --> 9128.0
yeah but as soon as you say like wait

9125.319 --> 9130.119999999999
this thing isn't real this is not

9128.0 --> 9132.08
something you should be afraid of shut

9130.12 --> 9135.76
it down shut it out

9132.08 --> 9139.0
quick don't spread that don't tell

9135.76 --> 9141.0
people aren't real that's dangerous all

9139.0 --> 9144.0
this misinformation is dangerous you're

9141.0 --> 9147.479
crazy you could get people killed for

9144.0 --> 9150.64
something that we literally can't prove

9147.479 --> 9154.599999999999
exists but we'll censor you for

9150.64 --> 9157.319
it yeah cuz you can scream all day long

9154.6 --> 9160.0
about things that are just made up and

9157.319 --> 9163.24
how terrified you are of those if you

9160.0 --> 9166.24
say that those things aren't real that's

9163.24 --> 9168.52
when you get punished for it on average

9166.24 --> 9172.16
average they kind of seem to leave me

9168.52 --> 9174.6
alone I think about

9172.16 --> 9177.319
it but maybe it's because I keep it kind

9174.6 --> 9179.76
of generalized I don't like name names

9177.319 --> 9182.479
like I'm not saying oh this very

9179.76 --> 9184.439
specific thing oh because then you like

9182.479 --> 9188.199999999999
trigger algorithm I'm I'm keeping it

9184.439 --> 9192.319
General because I can because it really

9188.2 --> 9195.640000000001
applies like viruses all of it is fake

9192.319 --> 9198.84
there's diseases there's Associated

9195.64 --> 9201.72
symptoms and things and tests that they

9198.84 --> 9204.16
do like your blood or whatever and P it

9201.72 --> 9206.519999999999
to see like hey do do we see these

9204.16 --> 9208.439
things that are typically said like hey

9206.52 --> 9210.319000000001
with all the page in the past that

9208.439 --> 9212.08
actually had it and that would go

9210.319 --> 9214.64
through the whole thing they would have

9212.08 --> 9218.16
this and that's how they test it does

9214.64 --> 9220.399
that mean it's the virus a virus no they

9218.16 --> 9222.359
don't know what that is it's just a

9220.399 --> 9224.88
phenomenon that is spotted and it's

9222.359 --> 9226.720000000001
associated with a certain sickness and

9224.88 --> 9229.839999999998
so you're meant to test for that and

9226.72 --> 9231.519999999999
then you can see right it's all just

9229.84 --> 9233.399
trial and error and they don't really

9231.52 --> 9235.319000000001
know they don't really know what those

9233.399 --> 9238.358999999999
things are a lot of the

9235.319 --> 9240.319
time there's research done but I mean it

9238.359 --> 9242.960000000001
doesn't really amount to much because

9240.319 --> 9245.88
it's all so small and the smaller you

9242.96 --> 9248.64
get right eventually you just get to the

9245.88 --> 9251.759999999998
cellular level and then the breath of

9248.64 --> 9255.8
life within and it's completely elusive

9251.76 --> 9258.399
they can't dissect the breath of life

9255.8 --> 9261.08
it's alive or it's dead and you just

9258.399 --> 9265.08
can't see how it's doing things that's

9261.08 --> 9268.52
how it really is that's how biology

9265.08 --> 9270.56
is after a certain level you just can't

9268.52 --> 9273.640000000001
figure it out anymore no matter what you

9270.56 --> 9275.479
do you just can't you can't see it you

9273.64 --> 9278.0
can't made it to be seen you can't open

9275.479 --> 9280.88
it up and then see how it worked when it

9278.0 --> 9283.34
was alive you just

9280.88 --> 9285.08
can it doesn't

9283.34 --> 9286.78
[Music]

9285.08 --> 9288.96
work

9286.78 --> 9291.0
[Music]

9288.96 --> 9294.96
Playdoh cave that also came up by the

9291.0 --> 9298.56
way on Earth Awakenings channel that was

9294.96 --> 9301.56
channel right I talked about stuck

9298.56 --> 9306.199999999999
between a wave assumption and a medium

9301.56 --> 9309.039999999999
need Earth Awakenings I remember

9306.2 --> 9312.319000000001
now they were talking about Plato's Cave

9309.04 --> 9312.319000000001
and philosophy and all

9315.0 --> 9318.0
that

9318.279 --> 9323.800000000001
I'm really into

9320.16 --> 9326.279
Socrates I really like that guy oh might

9323.8 --> 9331.119999999999
have been some weirdo issues with him or

9326.279 --> 9334.640000000001
whatever but like he's such a incredible

9331.12 --> 9334.640000000001
individualist I love

9334.8 --> 9341.199999999999
that it's like all about the personal

9337.439 --> 9344.08
struggle and is like as apparently noted

9341.2 --> 9347.640000000001
like how he felt like there were things

9344.08 --> 9349.8
warning him

9347.64 --> 9353.64
stopping him from doing bad

9349.8 --> 9355.278999999999
things like he called them demons but

9353.64 --> 9359.24
maybe they would be like more like

9355.279 --> 9362.399000000001
Guardian Angels right I mean it is the

9359.24 --> 9365.24
ancient Greek it's not the

9362.399 --> 9369.08
same atmology

9365.24 --> 9372.479
it's like the Christian way of Christian

9369.08 --> 9374.479
type Spirit cosmology didn't exist yet

9372.479 --> 9378.0
so

9374.479 --> 9381.72
right you could argue

9378.0 --> 9384.24
that before Angels were really known as

9381.72 --> 9387.16
Angels they called it all

9384.24 --> 9388.479
demons and that eventually the

9387.16 --> 9391.359
Christians

9388.479 --> 9394.0
recognized the real demons from the

9391.359 --> 9396.960000000001
Angels it's like oh but some demons work

9394.0 --> 9400.08
for God so they're

9396.96 --> 9402.358999999999
Angels right you got to realize that

9400.08 --> 9405.6
about it about all of

9402.359 --> 9408.04
it there's like a development curve in

9405.6 --> 9411.399000000001
the understanding of these spiritual

9408.04 --> 9413.6
things and and That Was Then always

9411.399 --> 9416.119999999999
Incorporated within the

9413.6 --> 9418.52
religion but like the time frame of when

9416.12 --> 9423.439
the religion was there it really matters

9418.52 --> 9426.2
for the level of understanding and

9423.439 --> 9429.52
differentiation it's very important so

9426.2 --> 9432.399000000001
in the Greeks like they would call all

9429.52 --> 9435.04
those incorporeal things

9432.399 --> 9437.8
demons they didn't have a concept for

9435.04 --> 9437.800000000001
angels yet

9450.88 --> 9455.16
Angels come from the angles of the

9455.24 --> 9460.88
arch

9457.88 --> 9460.88
okay

9464.8 --> 9467.8
interesting

9470.88 --> 9476.479
sense of dis yeah well maybe Angels did

9473.84 --> 9479.92
indeed originate from the

9476.479 --> 9482.88
stars and angles indeed it could

9479.92 --> 9485.04
be but I mean eventually they made their

9482.88 --> 9488.039999999999
way into the spiritual

9485.04 --> 9490.359
cosmology and became then seen as

9488.04 --> 9492.800000000001
entities not just as the lights in the

9490.359 --> 9496.319
sky or rather the lights in the sky

9492.8 --> 9498.16
could be representatives of entities

9496.319 --> 9500.92
that are not just those lights in the

9498.16 --> 9502.319
sky it all became more complicated and

9500.92 --> 9504.56
closer to

9502.319 --> 9506.88
you like

9504.56 --> 9509.76
effectively after

9506.88 --> 9513.199999999999
Christianity it like all these entities

9509.76 --> 9516.479
became much more as like it all all the

9513.2 --> 9519.439
personal communication from you as an

9516.479 --> 9521.679999999998
individual to a spirit or an angel all

9519.439 --> 9524.12
became more

9521.68 --> 9525.720000000001
emphasized right it all became about

9524.12 --> 9527.04
personal communication and person

9525.72 --> 9529.438999999998
personal

9527.04 --> 9530.640000000001
interactions with the angels and God and

9529.439 --> 9533.6
all

9530.64 --> 9537.199999999999
that right that's interesting to realize

9533.6 --> 9541.08
that that before that it wasn't so much

9537.2 --> 9541.08
that it was all more

9541.479 --> 9548.358999999999
distant during the Greek

9544.08 --> 9549.72
even like the gods were out there out

9548.359 --> 9553.52
out of our

9549.72 --> 9556.479
reach and like

9553.52 --> 9560.16
yeah and then through chisanity it's

9556.479 --> 9562.76
like no Christ is God and you directly

9560.16 --> 9565.24
talk to him you directly talk to God I

9562.76 --> 9566.64
mean that's kind of like the Greek all

9565.24 --> 9568.24
ancient Greek would have thought like

9566.64 --> 9571.0
wow those are

9568.24 --> 9576.64
crazy really think that God is going to

9571.0 --> 9576.64
talk to you puny human

9578.16 --> 9584.08
non-elect but yeah the Christianity made

9581.16 --> 9584.08
it all much more

9584.64 --> 9587.64
personal

9602.319 --> 9607.519999999999
waiting Enoch turned into

9604.92 --> 9610.52
Metatron yeah I

9607.52 --> 9613.52
guess mysterious though I wonder who

9610.52 --> 9613.52
wrote about that

9614.56 --> 9619.56
then

9616.84 --> 9622.0
I mean from the way that that book would

9619.56 --> 9625.278999999999
be you would have to conclude that Enoch

9622.0 --> 9628.04
wasn't the one that actually wrote the

9625.279 --> 9629.68
book cuz if you're no longer human then

9628.04 --> 9632.04
how are you going to write down those

9629.68 --> 9635.0
experiences in a

9632.04 --> 9637.240000000002
book it's kind of weird when you think

9635.0 --> 9637.24
about

9643.68 --> 9648.439
it one more need to go to church

9654.279 --> 9659.52
what Cube has 12 edges

9660.319 --> 9663.319
what

9666.07 --> 9669.128999999999
[Music]

9673.1 --> 9677.439
[Music]

9674.439 --> 9677.439
okay

9687.71 --> 9690.81
[Music]

9704.439 --> 9707.439
for

9734.359 --> 9738.319
e

9736.84 --> 9739.8
all right anyway I hope you guys have

9738.319 --> 9743.16
been enjoying the show man we've gone

9739.8 --> 9743.16
for two hours 40 minutes

9744.359 --> 9749.52
already they good and the weather sucks

9751.64 --> 9757.56
though you're a bit obsessed with

9754.08 --> 9760.399
religious anthropology yeah it's not

9757.56 --> 9763.439
strange at all there's a great many

9760.399 --> 9766.199999999999
things that we can learn from religions

9763.439 --> 9768.399
not like as to oby obey them blindly but

9766.2 --> 9771.479000000001
just like how are they from what time

9768.399 --> 9773.64
are they what region are they what was

9771.479 --> 9776.399
happening what was happening right

9773.64 --> 9777.8
before it was created right that's all

9776.399 --> 9781.0
very very

9777.8 --> 9782.759999999998
fascinating so yeah I'm with you there

9781.0 --> 9785.359
you don't have to apologize for being

9782.76 --> 9785.359
obsessed with

9788.359 --> 9794.279
that Carlos

9791.84 --> 9797.279
Santana

9794.279 --> 9797.279
Oh

9803.359 --> 9813.16
made the afternoon flyby and work I did

9808.0 --> 9813.16
huh okay I yeah I hope that's a good

9813.319 --> 9818.88
thing you're in a work right so that is

9816.12 --> 9821.479000000001
a good thing well I'm glad I'm glad that

9818.88 --> 9824.119999999999
uh turned out so great I mean I've been

9821.479 --> 9826.599999999999
I'm good I feel good it's been

9824.12 --> 9828.960000000001
interesting my my only regret now is

9826.6 --> 9831.84
that I can't put it all in the

9828.96 --> 9834.64
title all the different

9831.84 --> 9836.960000000001
subjects cuz we did talk about a lot of

9834.64 --> 9836.96
different

9842.2 --> 9847.16
things right so by all means share this

9844.88 --> 9848.759999999998
show it's a good one this is probably a

9847.16 --> 9852.72
better show to

9848.76 --> 9856.16
share cuz I've have a minimal level of

9852.72 --> 9857.84
swearing today I'm very control and I'm

9856.16 --> 9859.319
very happy about that I hope to do that

9857.84 --> 9861.880000000001
more often like

9859.319 --> 9864.24
that do I run the show every day yeah

9861.88 --> 9867.358999999999
you better believe it gentle bear every

9864.24 --> 9870.84
single day including

9867.359 --> 9875.16
weekend been doing it a long

9870.84 --> 9875.16
time there's no breaks for this

9879.359 --> 9884.68
guy right but I mean my show isn't

9882.279 --> 9886.439
always great because I'm not always in a

9884.68 --> 9889.56
super

9886.439 --> 9892.479000000001
good condition and

9889.56 --> 9895.72
then I'll still do a show because I like

9892.479 --> 9898.16
I don't feel terrible enough to like

9895.72 --> 9901.399
report in sick

9898.16 --> 9904.0
right cuz sounds strange and a lot of

9901.399 --> 9906.479
people don't agree yeah this is

9904.0 --> 9908.24
technically my job I don't like to repor

9906.479 --> 9911.119999999999
in

9908.24 --> 9914.479
sick I don't do that easily I don't

9911.12 --> 9916.240000000002
because I also need I need doing this

9914.479 --> 9919.64
and I need you

9916.24 --> 9919.64
guys around

9934.24 --> 9939.119999999999
me right and I try to be more

9936.399 --> 9941.64
entertaining I don't always succeed but

9939.12 --> 9943.6
I always try to develop and I especially

9941.64 --> 9946.358999999999
always try to be

9943.6 --> 9951.08
honest about everything everything

9946.359 --> 9951.08
including my own condition or how well I

9952.96 --> 9960.599999999999
did always trying to keep learning keep

9957.64 --> 9963.92
developing and to keep that Spirit out

9960.6 --> 9967.08
there like yeah like living it really is

9963.92 --> 9970.0
a NeverEnding learning process

9967.08 --> 9974.08
and development process and even when

9970.0 --> 9975.76
you do relatively little or a narrow set

9974.08 --> 9977.76
of things

9975.76 --> 9979.64
you must always keep developing like if

9977.76 --> 9981.439
you get stuck and you're like just

9979.64 --> 9985.76
repeating the same thing over and over

9981.439 --> 9988.880000000001
again without any dynamic or you become

9985.76 --> 9990.6
super predictable to yourself even like

9988.88 --> 9994.039999999999
that's

9990.6 --> 9996.279
hell you got stuck in a corner

9994.04 --> 9998.279
then when you get stuck in a corner you

9996.279 --> 10002.6
have to break

9998.279 --> 10004.800000000001
up I try not to get stuck in a corner I

10002.6 --> 10006.720000000001
just keep my freedom and it's like no

10004.8 --> 10007.679999999998
what whatever needs to be discussed will

10006.72 --> 10011.84
be

10007.68 --> 10015.399
discussed like and that well ends up

10011.84 --> 10017.56
with yeah a show that has like wildly

10015.399 --> 10021.319
differentiating subjects in all

10017.56 --> 10022.8
directions from physics to religious

10021.319 --> 10024.319
philosophical

10022.8 --> 10027.438999999998
discussions

10024.319 --> 10031.479
from movie discussions or social

10027.439 --> 10033.12
engineering or like

10031.479 --> 10036.358999999999
alternative

10033.12 --> 10038.800000000001
biology ideas and like hey what what

10036.359 --> 10038.800000000001
about

10039.12 --> 10042.720000000001
this what about

10046.72 --> 10051.278999999999
that analysis paralysis

10063.92 --> 10066.92
what

10071.11 --> 10074.259
[Music]

10074.439 --> 10080.279
right but uh yeah technically this show

10078.399 --> 10084.519999999999
only runs on

10080.279 --> 10087.960000000001
YouTube I mean there Odyssey does upload

10084.52 --> 10090.640000000001
a big chunk of my videos not all of them

10087.96 --> 10093.358999999999
automatically but this is the only place

10090.64 --> 10095.8
where there is a live chat I'm very

10093.359 --> 10098.439
strict with this live chat so unlike the

10095.8 --> 10101.24
Owen Benjamin Rumble live chat this one

10098.439 --> 10101.24
is quite under

10101.399 --> 10107.84
control and yeah Owen supposedly has

10104.399 --> 10110.119999999999
code of conduct and rules my rules are

10107.84 --> 10110.12
way

10111.2 --> 10117.66
stricter for my own protection and of

10114.56 --> 10120.039999999999
those that are around

10117.66 --> 10123.52
[Music]

10120.04 --> 10126.560000000001
me because I don't know the trolls

10123.52 --> 10129.880000000001
just do do even more their best to get

10126.56 --> 10132.08
in my face here and a lot of people that

10129.88 --> 10134.56
were part of the show eventually like

10132.08 --> 10137.319
turn on me and [ __ ] and then try to nag

10134.56 --> 10139.68
everybody that's that was alongside them

10137.319 --> 10141.88
or convince them to leave which is like

10139.68 --> 10145.52
really

10141.88 --> 10145.519999999999
bizarre and it doesn't

10148.359 --> 10154.0
work got some crazy folks stopping by

10151.24 --> 10155.6
yeah and today was a relatively calm day

10154.0 --> 10158.239
it was just one

10155.6 --> 10160.319
guy I've had days where there's like six

10158.239 --> 10163.039999999999
strolls

10160.319 --> 10165.8
just where you end up having a chat

10163.04 --> 10168.160000000002
where you only can see deleted

10165.8 --> 10169.96
messages because there's so many

10168.16 --> 10172.88
spamming

10169.96 --> 10174.96
[ __ ] like new account new account new

10172.88 --> 10178.96
account and then like five people at the

10174.96 --> 10178.96
same time that that's

10179.64 --> 10186.56
happened but today it's just one

10183.72 --> 10188.8
guy

10186.56 --> 10191.399
who was just non-stop projecting about

10188.8 --> 10191.399
everything he

10191.52 --> 10197.880000000001
said and like everybody that is in this

10194.88 --> 10201.199999999999
chat and has a wrench could read that

10197.88 --> 10203.239
and know know personally without me

10201.2 --> 10204.52
telling them that everything he said was

10203.239 --> 10207.88
pure

10204.52 --> 10213.479000000001
projection like no

10207.88 --> 10213.479
[Music]

10213.64 --> 10218.439
exception

10216.359 --> 10223.399000000001
right but I mean projecting is the thing

10218.439 --> 10226.720000000001
to do now like oh you you want to

10223.399 --> 10229.119999999999
oppose or projection it's going to be

10226.72 --> 10232.399
attack attack attack project project

10229.12 --> 10236.92
project it's what

10232.399 --> 10238.479
the the new world politicians do it's

10236.92 --> 10240.2
what a lot of

10238.479 --> 10244.239
these

10240.2 --> 10248.0
yeah globalist politicians do the

10244.239 --> 10250.6
conspir teror the antihuman politicians

10248.0 --> 10253.68
basically and a lot of people do it

10250.6 --> 10253.68
individually and on

10257.239 --> 10262.439
media project project

10259.88 --> 10264.72
project you hate something you're going

10262.439 --> 10266.56
to accuse it of everything you do you're

10264.72 --> 10268.08
going to falsely accuse it of things

10266.56 --> 10272.439
that you

10268.08 --> 10275.039999999999
do and then as you do that you can like

10272.439 --> 10278.319
even make up more details because you

10275.04 --> 10280.84
know so much about it because you're

10278.319 --> 10285.199999999999
accusing them of what you

10280.84 --> 10287.76
are it's a weird little Nifty Inside Out

10285.2 --> 10287.76
reality

10289.2 --> 10294.04
trick and a lot of people have made that

10291.72 --> 10296.319
trick their own and so they do it all

10294.04 --> 10299.6
the time now it's not rare anymore to

10296.319 --> 10301.88
see such insane Behavior it's been made

10299.6 --> 10304.279
it's normalized it's effectively

10301.88 --> 10305.16
normalized almost all trolls end up

10304.279 --> 10308.0
doing

10305.16 --> 10309.92
that people that get rejected and get

10308.0 --> 10311.82
angry they do that they just start

10309.92 --> 10322.749
projecting

10311.82 --> 10322.749
[Music]

10333.479 --> 10337.399
everything

10335.0 --> 10338.89

10349.99 --> 10362.809
[Music]

10363.439 --> 10366.439
list

10387.279 --> 10391.2
doing it

10388.88 --> 10393.199999999999
awesome well that's what I like to hear

10391.2 --> 10395.319000000001
and hey if you know any more people that

10393.2 --> 10398.359
you think like hey

10395.319 --> 10403.64
this might be an interesting place I do

10398.359 --> 10403.640000000001
like to associate with Owen Benjamin

10408.56 --> 10414.199999999999
Bears I got multiple bears that are that

10412.359 --> 10417.08
come over here through Owen

10414.2 --> 10419.84
Benjamin woodworking gunny

10417.08 --> 10426.359
bear it's been with me for a

10419.84 --> 10426.359
while and uh what else what other bears

10426.36 --> 10429.429
[Music]

10432.64 --> 10436.84
some of them were also like kind of

10434.239 --> 10436.84
trolls

10443.56 --> 10449.96
though cuz there's been some trolls that

10446.16 --> 10453.6
literally called themselves bear just to

10449.96 --> 10456.479
like I don't know try to ruin be name or

10453.6 --> 10456.479000000001
something it's it's

10483.279 --> 10486.279
weird

10492.0 --> 10497.52
my tea is getting

10494.479 --> 10502.08
cold it's not

10497.52 --> 10506.479000000001
surprising I had tea at 12 already

10502.08 --> 10509.52
so it's been cooling down for five hours

10506.479 --> 10509.519999999999
man it's 5 o'

10512.16 --> 10517.68
already very oh yeah thanks for that

10515.52 --> 10521.239
duper

10517.68 --> 10524.92
uh yeah also I mean

10521.239 --> 10526.399
but they just like try to stamp

10524.92 --> 10529.399
everything

10526.399 --> 10529.399
gay

10529.72 --> 10537.599999999999
right so no it's not related like we're

10533.8 --> 10542.56
definitely not like the Bears are not

10537.6 --> 10546.84
that duper so you can drop

10542.56 --> 10550.08
that it's very an annoying right but I

10546.84 --> 10554.04
mean dude just look at freaking

10550.08 --> 10557.56
supposedly lingos lingo associated with

10554.04 --> 10560.52
gay they just took so many things and

10557.56 --> 10562.399
just said oh this is gay now like

10560.52 --> 10564.640000000001
everything they claim everything like we

10562.399 --> 10567.319
can't have anything like everything

10564.64 --> 10569.8
becomes gay because they just call

10567.319 --> 10573.119999999999
everything say like oh this means gay

10569.8 --> 10576.72
now everything means gay now how about

10573.12 --> 10580.960000000001
no yeah they even stole gay literally

10576.72 --> 10583.479
yeah gay just used to mean

10580.96 --> 10588.16
happy but it's so

10583.479 --> 10588.16
ingrained even with me that I just

10603.08 --> 10609.359
yeah so as far as I'm concerned that's

10605.76 --> 10609.359
all cultural Marxist

10609.479 --> 10615.319
hijacking and I am definitely not going

10612.12 --> 10619.720000000001
to settle on the idea that bear means

10615.319 --> 10622.359
gay man gay hairy man or something [ __ ]

10619.72 --> 10625.76
off now you want to call yourself that

10622.359 --> 10628.0
that's [ __ ] gross stay away from me I

10625.76 --> 10628.0
mean

10628.12 --> 10632.479000000001
it yes Richard G they stole

10633.0 --> 10641.179
everything

10634.35 --> 10641.179
[Music]

10641.8 --> 10648.679999999998
like [ __ ] just used to mean old

10645.399 --> 10648.68
woman that's

10654.44 --> 10659.560000000001
[Music]

10656.0 --> 10662.88
it I like it South Park redefinition of

10659.56 --> 10662.88
[ __ ] that was the

10663.0 --> 10666.0
best

10668.319 --> 10672.84
it's arguably one of my favorite South

10670.52 --> 10672.84
Park

10672.88 --> 10679.72
episodes that made me laugh

10675.399 --> 10679.72
hard it's a cigarette yeah

10692.92 --> 10695.92
also

10697.64 --> 10701.72
inverted

10699.239 --> 10704.92
pyramid was that gay I didn't know that

10701.72 --> 10708.92
slow mode that's kind of

10704.92 --> 10708.92
creepy I didn't know that at

10721.67 --> 10724.54
[Music]

10722.92 --> 10729.92
all

10724.54 --> 10733.0
[Music]

10729.92 --> 10735.92
what was the South Park episode I can't

10733.0 --> 10735.92
think

10743.8 --> 10750.438999999998
uh I don't know exactly

10747.0 --> 10752.84
what a good

10750.439 --> 10755.84
question let me

10752.84 --> 10755.84
check

10756.76 --> 10765.479
[Music]

10763.84 --> 10769.279
oh it's called the

10765.479 --> 10773.519999999999
FW season 13 episode

10769.279 --> 10776.279
12 that's it yeah it has his own

10773.52 --> 10776.279
Wikipedia

10777.76 --> 10781.479
page that's freaking

10782.84 --> 10785.84
hilarious

10828.08 --> 10831.479
yikes solo

10838.16 --> 10841.569
[Music]

10842.72 --> 10845.72
yeah

10862.36 --> 10865.469000000001
[Music]

10873.239 --> 10877.48
let's get kind of dark in here my face

10876.0 --> 10878.68
is starting to light

10877.48 --> 10881.279
[Music]

10878.68 --> 10883.0
up that's what happens when it gets dark

10881.279 --> 10886.6
out

10883.0 --> 10890.299
there contrast just becomes

10886.6 --> 10890.299
[Music]

10902.359 --> 10909.16
higher right hitting the 3-hour

10906.52 --> 10911.6
Mark it's so yeah I'm not going

10909.16 --> 10914.92
to sure it's not going to be too much

10911.6 --> 10917.439
longer but I'll have some if the the

10914.92 --> 10921.08
animal is still here now I'm going to

10917.439 --> 10921.08
take a two minute break I'll be right

10932.56 --> 10935.56
back

11022.479 --> 11025.479
e

11052.399 --> 11055.399
for

11070.92 --> 11077.6
to USA oh gentle bear are you British I

11075.2 --> 11077.6
take it

11077.64 --> 11081.199999999999
then that will make

11082.359 --> 11085.359
sense

11097.319 --> 11101.119999999999
what

11098.76 --> 11104.399
part you know about Nathan Oakley have

11101.12 --> 11104.399000000001
you checked out his

11104.64 --> 11107.88
channel he's

11112.279 --> 11115.279
British

11117.399 --> 11123.64
like are you like familiar with flat

11120.16 --> 11124.64
Earth or you're not really into it too

11123.64 --> 11127.68
much

11124.64 --> 11134.84
or I did bring it up as a subject for a

11127.68 --> 11134.84
bit K ah okay no idea where that is but

11142.279 --> 11145.279
sure

11156.96 --> 11161.278999999999
lots of rits in the Flat Earth game yeah

11159.16 --> 11166.6
did seem like

11161.279 --> 11166.6
it does seem like a lot of them got into

11166.8 --> 11173.92
it it's like it seems there's as many

11170.16 --> 11176.399
Brits into like Flat Earth

11173.92 --> 11178.88
as there are like

11176.399 --> 11180.319
Americans and of course the America is

11178.88 --> 11184.16
way bigger

11180.319 --> 11187.399
so yeah relatively a lot of British

11184.16 --> 11187.399
people got into Flat

11202.2 --> 11207.720000000001
Earth

11204.72 --> 11207.72
oh man this

11208.2 --> 11212.0
weather's not getting any

11232.12 --> 11236.239000000001
better

11233.68 --> 11238.92
oh thanks BL Evolution I

11236.239 --> 11241.199999999999
mean I don't promote him all the time

11238.92 --> 11243.52
but I mean I'm going to test people on

11241.2 --> 11244.92
like hey do you know about him right I I

11243.52 --> 11249.720000000001
used to be

11244.92 --> 11252.2
on as a part of Nathan Oakley's shows

11249.72 --> 11253.519999999999
all the time I kind of like stepped away

11252.2 --> 11256.76
for a

11253.52 --> 11259.04
month not sure if I'm going to go back I

11256.76 --> 11261.76
because I think that things have just

11259.04 --> 11266.04
been going so

11261.76 --> 11267.64
well wouldn't you you guys say that my

11266.04 --> 11270.640000000001
show has been

11267.64 --> 11270.64
better

11272.04 --> 11278.2
honestly like most of you have been here

11274.359 --> 11278.2
for quite a while what do you

11279.399 --> 11287.0
think like am I better because I feel

11284.2 --> 11290.960000000001
better my shows are definitely longer

11287.0 --> 11290.96
and I'm just provably getting more

11292.04 --> 11295.04
views

11295.88 --> 11300.839999999998
I think I'm also on average less

11301.479 --> 11308.239
agitated cuz even though I really like

11305.279 --> 11310.439
to be part of the Flat Earth debate team

11308.239 --> 11315.0
a lot of the time I did feel like people

11310.439 --> 11317.319
would just like disrespect me or just be

11315.0 --> 11320.439
mean to me for no damn reason and then I

11317.319 --> 11323.92
would be like that would ruin my mood

11320.439 --> 11325.880000000001
too like that's not happening now like I

11323.92 --> 11328.12
know Neil's still out there being a

11325.88 --> 11331.239
weird and all that but I mean that

11328.12 --> 11334.800000000001
doesn't actually bother me because he's

11331.239 --> 11338.119999999999
not always saying that in in my

11334.8 --> 11341.64
ears because I'm not there and I'm not

11338.12 --> 11345.560000000001
always in that chat for him to like stop

11341.64 --> 11349.278999999999
saying that [ __ ] around me so it's

11345.56 --> 11349.278999999999
just it's more

11349.8 --> 11353.88
peaceful I like this much better oh

11352.12 --> 11356.160000000002
thanks right and I'll still bring up

11353.88 --> 11358.438999999998
Flat Earth things but I mean you got to

11356.16 --> 11362.039999999999
realize that compared to the guys of

11358.439 --> 11365.08
Flat Earth debates I'm not all that

11362.04 --> 11367.080000000002
technical right so if you're like oh you

11365.08 --> 11371.279
don't know the math or this or that and

11367.08 --> 11374.2
I'm like yeah you're right cuz I don't

11371.279 --> 11377.16
really care about that I care to

11374.2 --> 11379.239000000001
understand patterns and like I notice

11377.16 --> 11381.92
sub patterns of how people deal with

11379.239 --> 11384.439
information so if somebody's like

11381.92 --> 11387.439
basically resting their case on a

11384.439 --> 11389.439
vicious circle type reasoning like stuck

11387.439 --> 11392.84
between a wave assumption and a medium

11389.439 --> 11398.08
need I'll be the one to absolutely pick

11392.84 --> 11401.279
that up and I won't even use one number

11398.08 --> 11403.72
of math ever doing it yeah because

11401.279 --> 11406.279
that's what I do I just don't care about

11403.72 --> 11408.92
the math I think it's more of a

11406.279 --> 11411.279
distraction then it actually helps you

11408.92 --> 11413.8
get to the core of

11411.279 --> 11417.2
things which is what I get to the core

11413.8 --> 11420.519999999999
of things yeah look in between find the

11417.2 --> 11422.239000000001
way through yeah everybody's oh this

11420.52 --> 11425.52
side this side this side this side I'm

11422.239 --> 11428.199999999999
like but what about in between neither

11425.52 --> 11429.399000000001
of you look there what if you why didn't

11428.2 --> 11432.04
you go

11429.399 --> 11438.119999999999
there that's what I like to

11432.04 --> 11441.080000000002
do and if what I do as I did with uh

11438.12 --> 11444.479000000001
Earthbound Channel yesterday when I got

11441.08 --> 11447.479
on talking about

11444.479 --> 11449.64
The Ether

11447.479 --> 11452.8
ether yeah and I'm not going to get

11449.64 --> 11455.119999999999
angry about it but I am going to like

11452.8 --> 11458.16
point out when they're like basically

11455.12 --> 11460.160000000002
acting like a baller with it not really

11458.16 --> 11462.439
answering the question quickly moving on

11460.16 --> 11464.56
to the next subject when you ask

11462.439 --> 11467.76
something very

11464.56 --> 11470.6
specific or important about it that sort

11467.76 --> 11473.0
of thing so it's just that's how I do it

11470.6 --> 11475.399000000001
it's not super technical you're not

11473.0 --> 11478.0
going to hear me say the perfect

11475.399 --> 11480.119999999999
defining sentence where every number is

11478.0 --> 11483.279
right and every reference and every

11480.12 --> 11486.319000000001
historical citation is all included like

11483.279 --> 11491.2
I'm not that guy you want that guy

11486.319 --> 11494.319
Nathan Oakley 980 I mean he is the best

11491.2 --> 11497.68
at doing that from and every person I

11494.319 --> 11501.519999999999
have ever seen on the internet he is and

11497.68 --> 11503.52
I have great respect for him for that so

11501.52 --> 11505.239
damn good at it

11503.52 --> 11508.12
problem is is that because he's so damn

11505.239 --> 11511.439
good at it he seems to be very has very

11508.12 --> 11513.0
little tolerance

11511.439 --> 11517.6
for

11513.0 --> 11519.6
other things like not doing it like

11517.6 --> 11522.880000000001
that so he's

11519.6 --> 11526.12
not particularly flexible right and

11522.88 --> 11527.759999999998
that's well his problem yeah that's

11526.12 --> 11529.880000000001
because of how he does things I don't

11527.76 --> 11531.68
have that problem in the contrary yeah I

11529.88 --> 11534.479
am very

11531.68 --> 11538.479000000001
flexible I'm very dynamic in my Approach

11534.479 --> 11542.08
because I'm not that super hardcore

11538.479 --> 11544.438999999998
specific and cited on everything I do

11542.08 --> 11546.72
free speculation I do even free

11544.439 --> 11550.399
description I have to sometimes

11546.72 --> 11553.519999999999
improvise words because they literally

11550.399 --> 11556.399
don't exist for what I try to describe

11553.52 --> 11558.92
yeah that's and that's what I do Nathan

11556.399 --> 11561.358999999999
never does that [ __ ] ever he doesn't do

11558.92 --> 11563.84
that he stays the hell away from that

11561.359 --> 11566.720000000001
don't invent words unless it's like just

11563.84 --> 11569.72
for a silly joke or something don't do

11566.72 --> 11573.119999999999
that I do that I try to figure out like

11569.72 --> 11576.239
what the hell do I call this like like

11573.12 --> 11579.560000000001
things like a non-local hologram yeah

11576.239 --> 11583.16
that's a phraseology that didn't exist

11579.56 --> 11585.359
anywhere before I started saying that

11583.16 --> 11588.399
why did I start saying that well because

11585.359 --> 11590.640000000001
I just didn't know how else to describe

11588.399 --> 11594.56
what I

11590.64 --> 11594.56
Wasing and that's how that happened

11594.68 --> 11600.399
yeah and that phrase is not accepted at

11597.479 --> 11603.039999999999
fed it's not an argument that they

11600.399 --> 11606.278999999999
accept it's just my description of

11603.04 --> 11608.439
something that I don't perfectly know

11606.279 --> 11611.12
for sure it's just like yeah hey this

11608.439 --> 11613.56
missing evidence and this is my model

11611.12 --> 11616.68
that I conclude out of it it's quite

11613.56 --> 11619.6
surreal it's quite different from how

11616.68 --> 11622.279
people tend to think about it but I

11619.6 --> 11623.12
think I'm right about this I really do

11622.279 --> 11627.68
I'm

11623.12 --> 11630.76
very enthusiastic about the notion of

11627.68 --> 11633.04
non-local angular manifested Celestial

11630.76 --> 11635.72
lights non-local

11633.04 --> 11638.560000000001
holographic angular manifestations as

11635.72 --> 11642.08
the title from what is it now 3 two days

11638.56 --> 11645.519999999999
ago show worded perfectly it's the

11642.08 --> 11649.08
perfect wording for it

11645.52 --> 11649.08
yeah show

11650.2 --> 11655.84
1870 oh yeah two days ago the Celestial

11653.56 --> 11659.08
non-local holographic angular

11655.84 --> 11661.6
manifestations that's that's the full

11659.08 --> 11663.76
rounded

11661.6 --> 11666.0
explanation from what I figured out

11663.76 --> 11666.0
about

11666.319 --> 11671.6
it yeah Nathan wouldn't be able to do

11673.52 --> 11679.640000000001
that I do

11675.64 --> 11684.479
that but Nathan can make the perfect

11679.64 --> 11684.479
sided perfect numbered ARG

11686.52 --> 11694.640000000001
arent he can be much more concise in his

11690.04 --> 11696.2
rebottle against baller claims he's more

11694.64 --> 11700.119999999999
effective at the

11696.2 --> 11702.479000000001
debating even though because of that the

11700.12 --> 11704.560000000001
opponents just end up continually

11702.479 --> 11706.438999999998
whining oh you don't let me talk you

11704.56 --> 11707.96
don't let me talk why are you always

11706.439 --> 11709.92
interrupting me why are you always

11707.96 --> 11713.0
interrupting that's what eventually ends

11709.92 --> 11717.319
up happening but it's because he's so

11713.0 --> 11717.319
damn good at the actual

11717.92 --> 11723.279
argumentation that's just a fact we've

11720.88 --> 11726.278999999999
seen it over and over for

11723.279 --> 11726.279
years

11728.479 --> 11734.0
right so I'm different I'm much more

11732.04 --> 11737.560000000001
speculatory I'm much more

11734.0 --> 11740.6
psychologically oriented more esoteric

11737.56 --> 11742.84
and spiritual and I typically always

11740.6 --> 11744.68
busy myself trying to look in between

11742.84 --> 11746.8
trying to find that way through when I

11744.68 --> 11751.64
say find a way through

11746.8 --> 11754.96
that's spiritual as well as

11751.64 --> 11759.0
analytical observational sensory all of

11754.96 --> 11760.319
it it's like everybody oh always doing

11759.0 --> 11762.239
this always doing that it's so

11760.319 --> 11765.198999999999
straightforward everybody's used to it

11762.239 --> 11767.08
like what but what about in between

11765.199 --> 11769.720000000001
that's where Arn's always looking it's

11767.08 --> 11772.6
like why is this guy always in a strange

11769.72 --> 11775.519999999999
spot doing stuff it's like yeah because

11772.6 --> 11778.640000000001
he's looking in that place where

11775.52 --> 11780.6
specifically nobody looks I'm trying to

11778.64 --> 11782.198999999999
look in between yeah I'm trying to find

11780.6 --> 11785.52
that way

11782.199 --> 11789.199
through or you could even say the way

11785.52 --> 11793.279
through as in dimensionality right the

11789.199 --> 11795.76
idea an idea not fact not scientific

11793.279 --> 11801.279
fact or anything an idea of the fourth

11795.76 --> 11804.12
dimension yeah have up and down forward

11801.279 --> 11807.720000000001
backward left and

11804.12 --> 11812.479000000001
right right the the axes and then you

11807.72 --> 11816.16
have through and

11812.479 --> 11818.519999999999
back find the way through is also

11816.16 --> 11821.039999999999
arguably a fourth dimensional statement

11818.52 --> 11824.479000000001
because maybe that is what it

11821.04 --> 11826.399000000001
is right maybe looking in the spots

11824.479 --> 11831.198999999999
where nobody looks

11826.399 --> 11832.92
is in a way fourth dimensional

11831.199 --> 11835.04
through

11832.92 --> 11838.04
sounds a bit like magical thinking maybe

11835.04 --> 11839.720000000001
maybe it is but the point is is that I'm

11838.04 --> 11843.52
just keeping I'm going to keep doing

11839.72 --> 11846.438999999998
what I do because it's been so damn

11843.52 --> 11849.199
fruitful and relatively peaceful it's

11846.439 --> 11852.399
relatively peaceful here because I'm

11849.199 --> 11855.319000000001
just doing something in an area or a a

11852.399 --> 11858.92
band of frequency you could say where

11855.319 --> 11862.72
like nobody else does anything so I got

11858.92 --> 11865.319
all that frequency all to myself

11862.72 --> 11868.198999999999
I don't have to share it with a 100

11865.319 --> 11870.519999999999
billion or 100 million people or

11868.199 --> 11872.399000000001
something because they all believe that

11870.52 --> 11874.359
and they all lean on it and so when you

11872.399 --> 11875.96
tap into that frequency you basically

11874.359 --> 11878.0
share it with all of them and then they

11875.96 --> 11880.438999999998
rub off on you and

11878.0 --> 11883.479
then

11880.439 --> 11886.92
yeah because of how I do things I avoid

11883.479 --> 11889.519999999999
that process which emphasizes my

11886.92 --> 11892.8
individuality in the

11889.52 --> 11896.439
energies it helps me to separate

11892.8 --> 11900.039999999999
not dwelling on mainstream nonsense and

11896.439 --> 11902.0
mainstream opinions and mainstream ideas

11900.04 --> 11904.76
because when you do that you get carried

11902.0 --> 11907.68
away with the main

11904.76 --> 11911.16
stream the stream the stream of spirits

11907.68 --> 11913.16
the stream of energy the frequency what

11911.16 --> 11915.64
happens with all those people that do

11913.16 --> 11918.319
that when everybody does the same thing

11915.64 --> 11919.92
at the same time they start to resonate

11918.319 --> 11922.56
with each

11919.92 --> 11924.84
other you could even argue that there

11922.56 --> 11927.96
are like telepathic traits that then

11924.84 --> 11930.479
start to activate because you're so

11927.96 --> 11932.919999999998
alike you're so alike in how you feel

11930.479 --> 11936.519999999999
how you think what you want how you want

11932.92 --> 11938.439
to see things being done then you get

11936.52 --> 11940.319000000001
telepathic qualities because of the

11938.439 --> 11942.0
resonance because you could just predict

11940.319 --> 11943.56
exactly what the other will think like

11942.0 --> 11946.439
because they think like

11943.56 --> 11948.239
you and you can be able to if you know

11946.439 --> 11950.16
yourself at least and you study yourself

11948.239 --> 11951.76
then you can be able to predict yourself

11950.16 --> 11953.359
you can figure out oh I'm going to

11951.76 --> 11955.399
respond like this well if you know that

11953.359 --> 11958.08
about yourself then you'll know that

11955.399 --> 11960.358999999999
about somebody that's resonating exactly

11958.08 --> 11964.319
with the same things

11960.359 --> 11966.76
because nothing is really that

11964.319 --> 11969.08
unique it's all just the Spectrum and

11966.76 --> 11971.319
where are you sitting on the

11969.08 --> 11972.96
Spectrum but the spectrum is all

11971.319 --> 11977.68
contained it's all

11972.96 --> 11979.759999999998
one available Spectrum Avail where on

11977.68 --> 11982.239
the Spectrum are you going to sit with

11979.76 --> 11984.279
your frequency and this is all spiritual

11982.239 --> 11986.039999999999
mechanics talk by the way this is not

11984.279 --> 11990.12
this is not physics oriented this not

11986.04 --> 11992.880000000001
using physics terms this is

11990.12 --> 11996.439
spiritual hope that's

11992.88 --> 11999.319
clear right I try to find a way through

11996.439 --> 12000.56
I try to look in between where I think

11999.319 --> 12005.319
nobody's

12000.56 --> 12008.119999999999
looking and I dig up gems and I have in

12005.319 --> 12010.278999999999
the past it's proven it's proven that I

12008.12 --> 12012.92
have yeah that's how I dig out

12010.279 --> 12016.560000000001
physicality assumption bias

12012.92 --> 12018.88
right remember that I discovered that

12016.56 --> 12022.72
physicality assumption bias and I'm

12018.88 --> 12025.64
really proud of it because it is

12022.72 --> 12029.0
Monumental oh my God is physicality

12025.64 --> 12032.439
assumption by is a big thing a big

12029.0 --> 12034.64
factor in social engineering and

12032.439 --> 12036.239
Awakening

12034.64 --> 12040.56
huge

12036.239 --> 12043.359
huge very relevant right now and I'm

12040.56 --> 12046.68
very proud of having figured that out

12043.359 --> 12048.6
how did I do that my S people were just

12046.68 --> 12051.960000000001
like oh this assumption that assumption

12048.6 --> 12053.880000000001
oh you have no proof of that oh

12051.96 --> 12057.56
everybody believes that and while they

12053.88 --> 12059.72
were doing that I was looking in between

12057.56 --> 12061.399
and looking what is their minds doing

12059.72 --> 12063.0
they're latching on this side and

12061.399 --> 12064.599999999999
they're latching on that what do both

12063.0 --> 12066.319
those sides

12064.6 --> 12070.199
assume that

12066.319 --> 12073.92
it's that the sun is a physical light

12070.199 --> 12077.800000000001
like a lamp hanging over over a

12073.92 --> 12080.319
place they just assume that like yeah

12077.8 --> 12082.479
why it doesn't really seem to do that

12080.319 --> 12084.56
well maybe it's because they just

12082.479 --> 12087.438999999998
they're so used to when you see

12084.56 --> 12089.519999999999
something is physical right you open

12087.439 --> 12092.16
your eyes anything you're going to see

12089.52 --> 12094.720000000001
is probably going to be physical so it's

12092.16 --> 12098.479
the first assumption you have when you

12094.72 --> 12101.479
look at the sun well that's like an

12098.479 --> 12103.479
exception arguably you don't know if

12101.479 --> 12105.198999999999
that's f physical it doesn't seem to

12103.479 --> 12108.8
have these

12105.199 --> 12111.6
traits that physical objects

12108.8 --> 12113.64
share mainly that you can approach them

12111.6 --> 12117.16
and the angular size of them becomes

12113.64 --> 12119.0
bigger to you as the Observer Etc right

12117.16 --> 12122.039999999999
and a

12119.0 --> 12123.72
light as the inverse Square law so over

12122.04 --> 12126.160000000002
distance it will decrease yeah the

12123.72 --> 12129.319
celestial lights doesn't apply to any of

12126.16 --> 12131.119999999999
that at all like in practicality not

12129.319 --> 12134.319
based on the assumptions of what they

12131.12 --> 12136.479000000001
should be and how you should no in

12134.319 --> 12138.319
practicality the actual measurement the

12136.479 --> 12142.358999999999
actual observations none of those things

12138.319 --> 12145.76
apply yet because everything else we

12142.359 --> 12148.52
know is physical we can grab it we can

12145.76 --> 12150.960000000001
come closer wo bigger and it goes away

12148.52 --> 12154.84
it comes smaller yeah with everything

12150.96 --> 12156.88
else that applies so we just assume that

12154.84 --> 12159.199
the sun has to be that too because

12156.88 --> 12163.96
everything is

12159.199 --> 12167.479000000001
that even though it's seems to be a very

12163.96 --> 12170.839999999998
distinct exception to it but people just

12167.479 --> 12172.119999999999
don't see it because physicality

12170.84 --> 12175.04
assumption

12172.12 --> 12177.92
bias they just can't handle that it's

12175.04 --> 12180.279
not an object they're looking at that

12177.92 --> 12183.12
it's very likely not that so they just

12180.279 --> 12186.92
assume it's physical and I figured that

12183.12 --> 12191.800000000001
out and I'm very proud of figuring that

12186.92 --> 12194.68
out nobody assisted me with that I Arwin

12191.8 --> 12197.75
figure that out one

12194.68 --> 12200.960000000001
man and I'm very proud of

12197.75 --> 12204.12
[Music]

12200.96 --> 12206.399
it materialistic world food yeah that

12204.12 --> 12210.359
you could you could say that that that

12206.399 --> 12210.358999999999
is what it is that's where that's coming

12211.56 --> 12217.01
from I mean it certainly relates to it

12215.04 --> 12220.479000000001
it's the same

12217.01 --> 12223.319
[Music]

12220.479 --> 12225.319
direction yeah and mainstream cosmology

12223.319 --> 12230.359
the outer space cosmology

12225.319 --> 12232.319
is it is purely resting on that

12230.359 --> 12236.479000000001
physicality assumption

12232.319 --> 12238.96
bias like that is the main Claim about

12236.479 --> 12242.039999999999
heliocentrism is that oh you see those

12238.96 --> 12244.64
Stars they're giant balls of fire and

12242.04 --> 12247.84
gas in an infinite distance blah blah

12244.64 --> 12250.68
blah there all assumed to be

12247.84 --> 12252.319
physical it's just the immed no you just

12250.68 --> 12254.399
it's all physical of course it's all

12252.319 --> 12257.399
physical because what what you saying

12254.399 --> 12261.8
something exist that's not physical are

12257.399 --> 12266.039999999999
you crazy are you crazy that can

12261.8 --> 12268.039999999999
be yeah no I'm saying it isn't physical

12266.04 --> 12271.76
I'm saying it's a non-local

12268.04 --> 12274.319000000001
hologram you can't approach it when you

12271.76 --> 12276.880000000001
go up Stars

12274.319 --> 12278.16
disappear when you try to follow the

12276.88 --> 12283.119999999999
moon

12278.16 --> 12287.84
around it just keeps bending away

12283.12 --> 12292.319000000001
you can't get there what do we know

12287.84 --> 12295.399
exists that you can never get

12292.319 --> 12299.359
to well the background image in a

12295.399 --> 12304.119999999999
computer game can never get to

12299.359 --> 12306.84
that and like a hologram picture and

12304.12 --> 12306.84
holographic

12307.199 --> 12313.08
illusion like chasing a dragon a

12309.56 --> 12315.88
hologram right that that Direction so

12313.08 --> 12318.6
that's why I thought okay well maybe it

12315.88 --> 12321.039999999999
is like a hologram a non-local hologram

12318.6 --> 12323.800000000001
and hologram that's not made by a device

12321.04 --> 12326.439
with mirrors and light because those are

12323.8 --> 12328.399
not non-local they're local you can see

12326.439 --> 12330.399
them you can walk up to them the angular

12328.399 --> 12332.599999999999
size grows bigger as you approach the

12330.399 --> 12334.8
device that's creating

12332.6 --> 12338.6
that

12334.8 --> 12342.8
right but a rainbow exactly blue build

12338.6 --> 12345.960000000001
Evolution that's also a

12342.8 --> 12349.64
hologram it's a hologram created by the

12345.96 --> 12351.88
sunlight interacting with water droplets

12349.64 --> 12355.479
in the air at a certain

12351.88 --> 12358.92
angle but when you move the rainbow

12355.479 --> 12362.0
moves with you unlike the

12358.92 --> 12365.279
device that would make a hologram it

12362.0 --> 12368.199
doesn't move with you the image As you

12365.279 --> 12370.399000000001
move it doesn't happen with those things

12368.199 --> 12372.6
so there's just a distinct

12370.399 --> 12377.119999999999
difference

12372.6 --> 12380.0
between a rainbow created by the Sun or

12377.12 --> 12383.279
a rainbow created by a very bright light

12380.0 --> 12384.64
light indoors with some Mist right I

12383.279 --> 12386.92
mean there might be some kind of

12384.64 --> 12389.358999999999
Prismatic colors coming out of it but it

12386.92 --> 12392.16
doesn't look anything like a rainbow it

12389.359 --> 12394.960000000001
doesn't just like drape itself like on

12392.16 --> 12397.279
top of the image in your face as an

12394.96 --> 12399.64
actual rainbow does it's like always a

12397.279 --> 12403.12
layer that's on top of

12399.64 --> 12404.479
everything you can't create that with a

12403.12 --> 12406.960000000001
manmade

12404.479 --> 12409.8
lamp you can have some color effects but

12406.96 --> 12414.599999999999
not a manmade lamp it just doesn't

12409.8 --> 12414.599999999999
happen are not allive yeah they

12419.12 --> 12425.279
are all right so that's for elaboration

12423.439 --> 12428.399
about all

12425.279 --> 12431.84
that say things that I

12428.399 --> 12436.92
do but I feel that I am going to round

12431.84 --> 12436.92
out the show though before it gets all

12438.16 --> 12443.039999999999
dark what was good to like expound on

12452.12 --> 12461.52
that right so yeah my my views on what

12456.72 --> 12463.64
things are are much more complicated or

12461.52 --> 12467.16
rather

12463.64 --> 12469.479
unusual and remote from how most people

12467.16 --> 12472.92
tend to think about

12469.479 --> 12476.92
them and I really think I'm on the

12472.92 --> 12478.72
things I really think I'm right and

12476.92 --> 12481.52
there's nobody out there that's really

12478.72 --> 12483.56
proven the contrary other than oh look

12481.52 --> 12485.960000000001
at all these numbers

12483.56 --> 12487.92
and yeah there's somebody else that

12485.96 --> 12489.839999999998
claims something different and more

12487.92 --> 12493.239
people believe that like that's some

12489.84 --> 12493.239
evidence it isn't

12493.319 --> 12500.72
nobody's ever even gave me some kind of

12496.52 --> 12502.439
counterargument that even addresses my

12500.72 --> 12504.72
claims

12502.439 --> 12507.960000000001
so like at

12504.72 --> 12511.88
all so other than n or this is

12507.96 --> 12515.519999999999
ridiculous I that's as far as it's gone

12511.88 --> 12515.519999999999
in rebutting anything that I've

12520.199 --> 12523.199
said

12525.56 --> 12531.039999999999
sun in Southern California today either

12528.0 --> 12535.04
oh get entirely periodic

12531.04 --> 12538.080000000002
storms yeah well you know California

12535.04 --> 12540.319000000001
either it's dry as hell or it's wet as

12538.08 --> 12543.68
hell isn't

12540.319 --> 12546.92
it and it seems like California has gone

12543.68 --> 12549.76
into a new wet period so it may turn

12546.92 --> 12549.76
into a swamp

12550.12 --> 12554.239000000001
overall

12551.84 --> 12556.479
but then it's going to dry up again So

12554.239 --> 12558.319
eventually it'll go back to being

12556.479 --> 12561.198999999999
completely dry again don't worry about

12558.319 --> 12563.72
it just see it as like okay now the aqua

12561.199 --> 12567.6
first have some time to fill

12563.72 --> 12567.599999999999
up which is good

12580.12 --> 12583.12
right

12593.76 --> 12598.279
moving to North California all

12607.88 --> 12614.239
right I remember that 3 years ago it was

12610.68 --> 12615.880000000001
still super sunny and dry and then

12614.239 --> 12618.359
suddenly

12615.88 --> 12620.759999999998
like big clouds moved in and then

12618.359 --> 12624.76
everything flooded

12620.76 --> 12624.76
right that happened all of a

12640.04 --> 12643.04
sudden

12645.16 --> 12648.52
yeah that that that was the

12648.76 --> 12653.68
last that you didn't have to do that now
