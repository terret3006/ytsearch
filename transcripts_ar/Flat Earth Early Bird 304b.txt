2.77 --> 6.27
can anybody see me

29.56 --> 40.23
yeah finally okay so yeah sorry about

34.93 --> 45.07
that guys my internet connection just

40.23 --> 50.62
completely died and I had to reset the

45.07 --> 53.26
electricity yeah I'm lucky that I could

50.62 --> 56.949999999999996
you know because yeah pretty much the

53.26 --> 59.349999999999994
lock of it was broken taken out by the

56.95 --> 62.080000000000005
landlord you know you would like to keep

59.35 --> 64.57000000000001
it locked so and yeah there was only one

62.08 --> 68.65
room at home and you agreed to reset the

64.57 --> 70.57
electricity so yeah otherwise

68.65 --> 73.83000000000001
yeah the early bird show today would not

70.57 --> 73.83
have been longer than 20 minutes

83.9 --> 92.119
right right I was in the middle of

87.75 --> 94.83
talking about the whole cemetery nature

92.119 --> 100.28999999999999
the rectangular looping model of the

94.83 --> 106.7
confined space with potential barriers

100.29 --> 110.07000000000001
barriers loops and even just an end to

106.7 --> 116.119
where space where physical where

110.07 --> 118.94999999999999
material can exist just a limited range

116.119 --> 120.929
and after that you know nothing can go

118.95 --> 123.3
there so it yeah there could just be a

120.929 --> 126.479
natural barrier not from any material

123.3 --> 129.5
but simply nothing can get there nothing

126.479 --> 129.5
can move past there

139.11 --> 141.95000000000002
hmm

151.43 --> 161.68900000000002
yeah you have funny a coincidence

154.04 --> 164.379
perhaps maybe the advertisers are just

161.689 --> 170.629
trying to manipulate the [ __ ] out of me

164.379 --> 172.849
to kind of enforce weird snippets in

170.629 --> 175.92999999999998
certain ways that they prefer like that

172.849 --> 180.129
before I ruin it again according to them

175.93 --> 180.12900000000002
this is no that's just silly

186.47 --> 194.91
Wow I almost forgot about the about

191.85 --> 203.43
rhesus donation man that's that is such

194.91 --> 206.01
a just amazing timing really one of the

203.43 --> 210.48000000000002
first things I'm gonna do with it is get

206.01 --> 212.57999999999998
some fish oil because I think that it's

210.48 --> 215.7
been palpable since I stopped taking

212.58 --> 219.41000000000003
that that's exactly when I started to

215.7 --> 219.41
become pissed off at everything

222.349 --> 225.189
so

233.43 --> 237.40900000000002
are you all blabbering about

251.12 --> 257.54
now over moco that has nothing to do

253.79 --> 259.13
with YouTube now didn't even have to do

257.54 --> 261.26000000000005
anything directly with my internet

259.13 --> 265.37
connection it's simply a certain type of

261.26 --> 269.59
connector that sometimes gives out and

265.37 --> 272.9
usually I just reset it from my side and

269.59 --> 274.94
it just work but sometimes it doesn't

272.9 --> 277.12
and then I have to reset it from the

274.94 --> 280.25
other side but if nobody's there

277.12 --> 282.32
the door is locked then the only

280.25 --> 284.84
alternative for me is to either just set

282.32 --> 287.24
it out or reset the electricity if

284.84 --> 290.979
that's an option and it is right now so

287.24 --> 290.979
it's lucky enough with that

303.59 --> 310.7
mark of Melbourne krill or fish oil

306.68 --> 314.54
better in Europe in it I don't know it

310.7 --> 318.2
all depends I've had the krill oil from

314.54 --> 321.139
the infowar store and that stuff was

318.2 --> 325.21
absolutely amazing it's kind of

321.139 --> 327.74
expensive though and I don't know I

325.21 --> 332.419
would have to kind of look into it you

327.74 --> 335.56
know technically there there are kind of

332.419 --> 343.01
good brands for supplements out here

335.56 --> 344.99
they seem good enough I've seen weird

343.01 --> 348.83
things by the way the talking about fish

344.99 --> 350.75
oil they even had in India tea organic

348.83 --> 356.06
so it was pretty impressive just a

350.75 --> 359.27
bottle of fish oil seemed extremely

356.06 --> 362.12
disgusting to me but still that is that

359.27 --> 364.9
is probably pretty good quality that

362.12 --> 364.9
they'd bottle it

368.84 --> 371.40999999999997
why

377.18 --> 387.37
why or are you trying to data-mine me

385.01 --> 387.37
again

408.649 --> 411.649
so

415.719 --> 418.469
right

424.77 --> 430.12899999999996
huh hilarious I don't do morning

427.379 --> 430.129
stretches

435.62 --> 444.32
I do but since my diet changed so much

441.59 --> 448.63899999999995
and since I basically been eating right

444.32 --> 451.37
and not taking toxic crap anymore I've

448.639 --> 454.79
just no need really to do it although

451.37 --> 458.419
sometimes I kinda get in a little bit

454.79 --> 460.70000000000005
stiff mostly type of situation

458.419 --> 464.45
especially when it suddenly gets really

460.7 --> 469.06
cold and moist or something but overall

464.45 --> 469.06
now I'm doing fine

474.86 --> 484.03000000000003
yeah chia seeds can work I've used those

477.74 --> 489.86
as well my ex really liked those and

484.03 --> 494.29999999999995
they're great to mix in with like with

489.86 --> 497.51
raw juicing so we did that like raw

494.3 --> 502.07
juice bunch of fruit and vegetables like

497.51 --> 506.48
apples and berries and whatever and some

502.07 --> 508.43
vegetables maybe yeah it was good and

506.48 --> 515.5
then throw in the chia seeds afterward

508.43 --> 515.5
was great kind of kind of expensive

528.83 --> 539.47
what are you talking about when am i

535.76 --> 539.47
doing my presentation

545.98 --> 553.54
what about the presentation I gave I

549.24 --> 556.48
just I just did that didn't think that

553.54 --> 561.7199999999999
was a presentation didn't it contain

556.48 --> 561.72
enough math for you what's the problem I

564.22 --> 569.4100000000001
[Music]

565.38 --> 572.1
really don't know how to get more clear

569.41 --> 576.5699999999999
and straightforward than I have so far I

572.1 --> 576.57
really don't know what else to do

584.98 --> 590.5
right mother Salim okay that's fine yeah

588.14 --> 590.5
I did it

595.5 --> 603.0
so yeah if you missed it then just go

598.41 --> 606.5
watch the first part because before the

603.0 --> 610.5
internet cut out and I had to stir it up

606.5 --> 612.14
304 B as I typically do when that

610.5 --> 615.87
happens

612.14 --> 619.34
and I also explained the you had the

615.87 --> 630.63
remnants of it at the beginning of this

619.34 --> 633.27
stream so all right by the way to

630.63 --> 634.74
anybody seeing this or whatever for the

633.27 --> 636.35
first time please don't forget to

634.74 --> 641.46
subscribe

636.35 --> 645.99
help me cuz I want to see 1.5 K sometime

641.46 --> 648.0600000000001
you know and I have gained well sizable

645.99 --> 650.97
amount of subscribers to my opinion

648.06 --> 652.53
recently so that is nicer don't know

650.97 --> 654.84
where they came from if they're gonna

652.53 --> 656.49
Kawai you and if I say the wrong thing

654.84 --> 659.73
to the wrong person although at this

656.49 --> 661.71
point I don't know what else I can even

659.73 --> 666.66
say that could do that because I have

661.71 --> 668.4300000000001
been pretty much very blunt recently it

666.66 --> 675.2099999999999
could be a lot worse though but that

668.43 --> 677.67
would not be very productive but yeah

675.21 --> 681.36
anyone anyone who has subscribed

677.67 --> 685.56
recently thank you for that and I hope

681.36 --> 688.79
you do find the my early bird show worth

685.56 --> 691.89
while sitting through and listening to

688.79 --> 693.9
maybe live or afterward I hear a lot of

691.89 --> 695.9399999999999
people it's too early for them so they

693.9 --> 698.34
listen to it afterward and it kind of

695.94 --> 701.58
surprises me really because am I really

698.34 --> 704.48
that interesting probably not if I just

701.58 --> 707.49
keep on whining continually about oh I

704.48 --> 712.52
have feelings issues who are winners

707.49 --> 712.52
always with the feeling issues it's

713.3 --> 720.2299999999999
you know maybe I should just completely

718.52 --> 722.4399999999999
turn that around or something but that

720.23 --> 728.8100000000001
would be the way to weird

722.44 --> 732.5600000000001
it's just that honesty is good but it

728.81 --> 736.79
also changes people's attitudes towards

732.56 --> 739.2199999999999
you and there are people out there that

736.79 --> 743.24
have very specific responses they think

739.22 --> 748.01
that a thing into it intuitively that

743.24 --> 749.9
honesty is a sign of desperation because

748.01 --> 752.87
if you're in control then why would you

749.9 --> 756.29
need to be honest yeah blah blah you got

752.87 --> 758.8100000000001
it under control right so then they

756.29 --> 763.06
think Oh our win is honest so that means

758.81 --> 767.27
he needs my help and that he wants that

763.06 --> 772.0
and then they're gonna help me as they

767.27 --> 775.79
see fit well I don't like that at all

772.0 --> 778.1
find that very aggravating in general

775.79 --> 784.04
that kind of attitude and you all know

778.1 --> 787.76
by now who I'm talking about and you've

784.04 --> 789.5
all seen me respond to that stuff so you

787.76 --> 802.12
know what I'm talking about I'm pretty

789.5 --> 802.12
sure most of you do even care but

803.38 --> 809.8
yeah that's for the rest of it

813.36 --> 822.899
right well only Shippo can see you know

817.05 --> 836.04
sometimes my light irritates my demons a

822.899 --> 836.04
lot a lot you know let me try it

838.75 --> 848.33
okay Lottie sure why not

842.68 --> 850.75
spoonful at America that can be a spoon

848.33 --> 855.83
of this size that would be fine with me

850.75 --> 861.38
no problem with that although I don't

855.83 --> 863.24
really see the point anyway but when you

861.38 --> 865.97
get really pissed off especially at

863.24 --> 872.83
yourself and frustrated it's basically

865.97 --> 876.65
frustrated of poor choices and also that

872.83 --> 879.73
my feelings just I figured it out like

876.65 --> 885.4399999999999
every time my feelings get in the way of

879.73 --> 889.07
making sensible durable decisions a lot

885.44 --> 891.7700000000001
and it's really almost like a demon just

889.07 --> 894.74
pops up in me and goes like hahaha

891.77 --> 897.5
no you're not gonna do that I'm gonna

894.74 --> 899.45
make you do something really stupid or

897.5 --> 903.65
anxious or something they'll repulse

899.45 --> 905.5400000000001
people accidentally so then it'll break

903.65 --> 906.86
and all that tension will fall away all

905.54 --> 908.6899999999999
the tension that you don't want to

906.86 --> 911.51
handle you don't want to handle it are

908.69 --> 915.1400000000001
we no no it's too much it hurts it hurts

911.51 --> 918.89
it makes you hate everything more yes so

915.14 --> 921.4399999999999
just flip out do something stupid or get

918.89 --> 924.1899999999999
really really low-energy anything to

921.44 --> 927.1700000000001
change me around to just [ __ ] it up

924.19 --> 931.46
because if I don't want to end it

927.17 --> 934.37
actively well then it is gonna make me

931.46 --> 938.3000000000001
do that by just screwing me over like a

934.37 --> 938.9
stupid little temper tantrum six years

938.3 --> 942.56
old

938.9 --> 945.74
that's like inside of me like

942.56 --> 948.9499999999999
spiritually still there and he is still

945.74 --> 953.75
not really under control because I

948.95 --> 957.71
mostly just treated him I basically did

953.75 --> 960.68
the bad thing by bad parenting to my own

957.71 --> 963.59
kid inside myself and mike has always

960.68 --> 966.9499999999999
been horrifying the attention drawing

963.59 --> 970.5500000000001
and way too much demanding it's just can

966.95 --> 972.62
do miraculous things too but just it's

970.55 --> 976.8599999999999
too much for anyone

972.62 --> 979.589
that side of me you know if I go into a

976.86 --> 984.72
relation it's gonna be like okay well I

979.589 --> 986.7600000000001
know you think you like me but there are

984.72 --> 989.82
some things about me that I need to warn

986.76 --> 991.71
you about and like there's gonna be

989.82 --> 992.82
tests and this is exactly what it's

991.71 --> 995.87
about and even though you can't even

992.82 --> 999.1500000000001
imagine that right now

995.87 --> 1002.69
cuz yeah why would you you're a normal

999.15 --> 1005.3299999999999
person relatively normal person yeah

1002.69 --> 1008.9000000000001
it's going to be crazy at times because

1005.33 --> 1012.74
that freaking subconscious of mine is

1008.9 --> 1017.63
gonna do it all it's gonna [ __ ] all over

1012.74 --> 1021.79
the situation shock and horrify the [ __ ]

1017.63 --> 1026.959
out of people not with violence but just

1021.79 --> 1029.51
with just terrible character traits that

1026.959 --> 1032.24
are kind of hidden underneath it all

1029.51 --> 1036.53
that I had to deal with very early on in

1032.24 --> 1038.809
life and that I managed to escape every

1036.53 --> 1041.24
time in a relation when get serious when

1038.809 --> 1043.04
I get really close to like a permanent

1041.24 --> 1044.99
type of bombing it comes up and it just

1043.04 --> 1048.8799999999999
shows itself and it don't get violent

1044.99 --> 1055.82
ever so don't even try to imagine that

1048.88 --> 1059.8300000000002
but I do get like horrifically grim for

1055.82 --> 1063.59
example like very pessimistic or just

1059.83 --> 1068.3899999999999
self-loathing unbelievable no not

1063.59 --> 1072.74
narcissism no just unbelievable levels

1068.39 --> 1076.1000000000001
of despise in general also towards

1072.74 --> 1078.26
myself it's it's equal you know every

1076.1 --> 1080.57
time I call when I'm in this type of

1078.26 --> 1087.41
mood and I say people are [ __ ]

1080.57 --> 1089.9289999999999
[ __ ] I'm including myself and when I

1087.41 --> 1094.0700000000002
say that I don't mean [ __ ] as in who

1089.929 --> 1097.3700000000001
they can't figure out basic tasks that

1094.07 --> 1101.1789999999999
most people can figure out no I'm

1097.37 --> 1102.9599999999998
talking about being sensible about

1101.179 --> 1106.38
things and

1102.96 --> 1109.29
being very strong against delusion and

1106.38 --> 1114.39
pressure on certain levels and most

1109.29 --> 1117.6299999999999
people just aren't most people aren't

1114.39 --> 1119.94
and the ones that are they probably hide

1117.63 --> 1122.13
because they know that it's just gonna

1119.94 --> 1125.72
get tougher if you draw people in with

1122.13 --> 1125.72
you that can't handle it

1131.69 --> 1142.68
right but at the same time besides toast

1134.91 --> 1145.8300000000002
those traits besides those moments that

1142.68 --> 1150.74
it will test anyone I also have a lot of

1145.83 --> 1154.77
glory to present like I can absolutely

1150.74 --> 1159.8
show a girl what it is to have somebody

1154.77 --> 1159.8
truly devout to them

1164.28 --> 1177.6499999999999
so but it's got to be real though it has

1169.62 --> 1177.6499999999999
to be natural just has to happen yeah

1181.01 --> 1184.01
yeah

1184.97 --> 1190.8500000000001
all right well hey Randy if this isn't

1188.9 --> 1194.3200000000002
good to listen to well maybe you should

1190.85 --> 1198.74
listen back to your own show last night

1194.32 --> 1201.62
because the blabber love blahblah love

1198.74 --> 1205.07
between Brian and Trish wasn't exactly

1201.62 --> 1216.1599999999999
great to listen to either and that's not

1205.07 --> 1216.1599999999999
me saying that for starters so you know

1220.74 --> 1223.74
right

1231.35 --> 1236.6599999999999
yeah it's not that much drama

1234.21 --> 1236.66
really

1246.95 --> 1249.669
right

1250.68 --> 1260.3100000000002
I'm just trying to convey what the hell

1256.2 --> 1263.04
I'm dealing with and how disruptive

1260.31 --> 1264.06
certain elements about me are mostly

1263.04 --> 1267.1499999999999
against myself

1264.06 --> 1269.9099999999999
I hope has not leaked towards others you

1267.15 --> 1272.19
know that same disruptive spirit when I

1269.91 --> 1273.21
was much younger I also used that

1272.19 --> 1278.76
towards others

1273.21 --> 1281.82
I made some people quite miserable back

1278.76 --> 1284.7
in the day when I got in a bad mood like

1281.82 --> 1287.1599999999999
when people really shat on me or made me

1284.7 --> 1290.4
feel absolutely shitty about myself then

1287.16 --> 1292.5900000000001
yeah I would do the same to others and I

1290.4 --> 1295.74
would be way too good at it totally

1292.59 --> 1298.59
abused my intelligence for it it's

1295.74 --> 1300.98
terrible I don't do that anymore I do my

1298.59 --> 1303.8999999999999
absolute best to avoid that at all cost

1300.98 --> 1306.999
because it's it's pure sin

1303.9 --> 1306.999
[Music]

1308.37 --> 1311.59
[Applause]

1313.339 --> 1323.999
yeah yeah hazmat yeah I saw that I

1317.059 --> 1330.389
didn't see it live but deep inside the

1323.999 --> 1333.599
rabbit hole the ITER h-he cut it down in

1330.389 --> 1337.1989999999998
that part and put it up on his channel

1333.599 --> 1340.4689999999998
and I watched that it was pretty cool

1337.199 --> 1343.489
I agree i watch that like a half an hour

1340.469 --> 1343.489
before the show started

1347.59 --> 1350.6399999999999
[Music]

1354.14 --> 1357.269
[Music]

1358.63 --> 1366.25
right I agree by the way only Shippo can

1362.2 --> 1368.77
see yeah I know well the thing is it's

1366.25 --> 1371.41
the feelings it's not the thoughts I

1368.77 --> 1375.16
don't allow thoughts to really

1371.41 --> 1377.92
completely manifest beyond superficial

1375.16 --> 1381.28
fantasy or any fantasy that would be

1377.92 --> 1385.8400000000001
sizable enough to accidentally grab

1381.28 --> 1389.32
ahold of it and keep holding on but it's

1385.84 --> 1393.52
mostly just the feelings that spur those

1389.32 --> 1394.57
types of thinking and there's not a lot

1393.52 --> 1398.32
I can do about it

1394.57 --> 1400.84
about those feelings I can try to ignore

1398.32 --> 1402.82
it but seriously like when I do that

1400.84 --> 1407.32
that is kind of like swallowing the

1402.82 --> 1410.53
tension effect and that can do all kinds

1407.32 --> 1412.9299999999998
of shitty things to my physiology like

1410.53 --> 1414.1
I've done that [ __ ] like swallow my

1412.93 --> 1417.64
pride kind of thing

1414.1 --> 1420.4599999999998
or worse or just swallow that I kind of

1417.64 --> 1424.66
am severely repulsed by people I'm

1420.46 --> 1427.8700000000001
forced to deal with then I'll get some

1424.66 --> 1429.94
kind of weird muscle spasm somewhere and

1427.87 --> 1436.6599999999999
then have back problems that kind of

1429.94 --> 1439.99
[ __ ] it's part of why I also had to

1436.66 --> 1443.02
force myself to learn to express all

1439.99 --> 1445.39
that because it's just better for my own

1443.02 --> 1448.54
health if I don't swallow all that

1445.39 --> 1451.8600000000001
tension because it literally physically

1448.54 --> 1451.86
breaks me apart to do that

1481.07 --> 1484.099
[Music]

1489.96 --> 1491.96
ah

1498.98 --> 1506.3600000000001
oh yeah I don't have skype open

1503.56 --> 1511.12
well maybe did somebody did kind of want

1506.36 --> 1511.12
to call me yeah I forgot to reopen it ah

1514.21 --> 1518.63
damn it

1515.59 --> 1523.49
yeah Rhys actually tried to Skype call

1518.63 --> 1525.67
me at 25 but that's exactly when my

1523.49 --> 1529.34
internet just caught out ah

1525.67 --> 1531.73
and I forgot to reopen Skype when I

1529.34 --> 1535.03
started up the show damn it

1531.73 --> 1538.39
yeah it's only ten minutes left

1535.03 --> 1538.3899999999999
that's too bad

1540.82 --> 1547.1
sorry Rhys I hope maybe another time you

1545.66 --> 1548.1100000000001
could come out maybe tomorrow that would

1547.1 --> 1551.57
be nice

1548.11 --> 1553.1899999999998
wait no tomorrow I can't yeah tomorrow

1551.57 --> 1557.35
there's not gonna be an early bird show

1553.19 --> 1561.5900000000001
because tomorrow I'm going back over to

1557.35 --> 1564.8
my lady friend over in MA huh and her

1561.59 --> 1566.9599999999998
daughter cuz yeah

1564.8 --> 1572.18
she need she needs a man in the house

1566.96 --> 1574.3400000000001
and I yeah I seem to be exactly what

1572.18 --> 1576.55
she's needing which is also very good

1574.34 --> 1580.76
for my ego if I don't go too much

1576.55 --> 1583.58
berserk from being in situation that I

1580.76 --> 1587.75
would have wished I was really my

1583.58 --> 1590.84
situation it's not gonna really work but

1587.75 --> 1592.96
like the last time anyway but I'm still

1590.84 --> 1596.11
looking forward to seeing her again and

1592.96 --> 1600.43
yeah last time was really great

1596.11 --> 1600.4299999999998
no not shagging don't

1609.69 --> 1619.95
besides like that would be weird but

1615.02 --> 1624.36
yeah the lady friend how do you say a

1619.95 --> 1626.88
friend okay but yeah she is a mother how

1624.36 --> 1628.6799999999998
do you say that I don't know she used to

1626.88 --> 1631.2
be my girlfriend

1628.68 --> 1635.16
a long time ago not for very long but

1631.2 --> 1637.49
we've never really broken up with hatred

1635.16 --> 1644.6000000000001
or anything

1637.49 --> 1647.76
yeah but she's been like just recently

1644.6 --> 1651.09
like reef falling in love with like her

1647.76 --> 1653.55
first boyfriend from long ago and had

1651.09 --> 1662.4299999999998
opportunity meet him but he's married in

1653.55 --> 1666.8
those kids so I don't know she probably

1662.43 --> 1671.64
needs just more comfort for friend and

1666.8 --> 1674.34
just to get her mind off that because

1671.64 --> 1677.97
with this lady yeah love really

1674.34 --> 1681.6599999999999
seriously I hit it don't stop it stop at

1677.97 --> 1684.3500000000001
you a bunch of sodomite perverts it's

1681.66 --> 1684.3500000000001
disgusting

1688.99 --> 1693.1200000000001
yeah you people repulse me

1702.29 --> 1708.05
right well it doesn't necessarily have

1705.74 --> 1712.18
to be you know because she's a flat

1708.05 --> 1712.18
earther as well yeah yeah

1720.11 --> 1726.37
she's having her own issues with that

1722.21 --> 1726.3700000000001
though but anyway

1727.12 --> 1730.1899999999998
[Music]

1733.65 --> 1740.1000000000001
look I'm not ready for a relationship

1736.4 --> 1742.5
it's very simple it's just not gonna

1740.1 --> 1748.4399999999998
happen it's not gonna happen because if

1742.5 --> 1751.11
I did it would be a similar type event

1748.44 --> 1753.21
as with my ex because I can't enter any

1751.11 --> 1757.039
relationship from a place of financial

1753.21 --> 1760.1100000000001
incompetence I just can't do that and

1757.039 --> 1763.08
before with my ex I was able to do that

1760.11 --> 1769.9189999999999
because I said I had all this money from

1763.08 --> 1771.4499999999998
inheritance now I don't have it so it's

1769.919 --> 1774.2700000000002
not gonna happen

1771.45 --> 1777.299
at first I'm gonna have a financial

1774.27 --> 1779.22
basis and who knows maybe the women will

1777.299 --> 1785.49
just flock all over me I

1779.22 --> 1788.159
I'll probably get annoyed by that yeah

1785.49 --> 1790.289
lotty one more shady remark like that

1788.159 --> 1794.24
and you're banned again so it's up to

1790.289 --> 1794.24
you it's up to you Lottie

1796.25 --> 1799.359
[Music]

1812.23 --> 1814.919
No

1816.059 --> 1824.86
absolutely not two years no I'm not

1821.519 --> 1828.69
gonna work and then not work and waste

1824.86 --> 1831.2199999999998
all that money again absolutely not no

1828.69 --> 1837.3990000000001
if I'm gonna work I'm gonna keep on

1831.22 --> 1840.82
working and maybe I'll just get it more

1837.399 --> 1844.029
efficient and do it partially if that

1840.82 --> 1845.6789999999999
can still eventually make enough money

1844.029 --> 1847.69
because starting out that will

1845.679 --> 1849.909
absolutely not be the case I'm just

1847.69 --> 1852.7
gonna have to do a full-time it's gonna

1849.909 --> 1853.72
be basic it's mostly just gonna get used

1852.7 --> 1856.32
to the strain

1853.72 --> 1859.33
try not to physically break down and

1856.32 --> 1861.1299999999999
size of my diet to the new condition so

1859.33 --> 1865.33
it's probably gonna be organic whey

1861.13 --> 1868.419
power powder and I'm probably gonna try

1865.33 --> 1871.09
out alpha power maybe order some of that

1868.419 --> 1874.929
or an alternative because it does really

1871.09 --> 1877.09
help physically a lot to have that extra

1874.929 --> 1879.429
testosterone it gives more confidence

1877.09 --> 1882.1589999999999
more urge to do physical things in the

1879.429 --> 1886.049
first place and just a better overall

1882.159 --> 1893.25
condition and I still have some of that

1886.049 --> 1893.25
and yeah we'll see from there on

1903.24 --> 1906.24
yeah

1911.68 --> 1923.69
yeah Randy nobody's gonna submit [ __ ] to

1915.35 --> 1928.2199999999998
me they're all gonna be laughing ha

1923.69 --> 1930.95
you're a 40 year old guy had never

1928.22 --> 1932.63
really worked and you think you're smart

1930.95 --> 1934.43
but you're aflutter through so you're a

1932.63 --> 1935.99
[ __ ] so that's what's gonna happen if

1934.43 --> 1937.19
I'm gonna be all open and honest uh

1935.99 --> 1940.88
that's not gonna happen

1937.19 --> 1944.96
when I go to that stuff literally nobody

1940.88 --> 1947.15
is gonna know a [ __ ] about me and when

1944.96 --> 1949.67
they ask it's like you don't want to

1947.15 --> 1954.8000000000002
know wait let me rephrase that no I

1949.67 --> 1960.17
don't want you to know and then they'll

1954.8 --> 1962.69
just drop it if they're smart and I'm

1960.17 --> 1965.0
not gonna resist Authority you know what

1962.69 --> 1967.5700000000002
to some level I might even let them

1965.0 --> 1969.92
humiliate me in some kind of rookie way

1967.57 --> 1972.4399999999998
because I will break through that

1969.92 --> 1974.78
gloriously been through that kind of

1972.44 --> 1976.43
[ __ ] plenty of times in my youth I know

1974.78 --> 1981.08
how to do it I don't give a [ __ ] at that

1976.43 --> 1982.73
point I know I'm the underdog but I also

1981.08 --> 1984.56
know I'm a lot smarter than everybody

1982.73 --> 1989.63
and they're too stupid to realize it

1984.56 --> 1991.97
overall so that's all fine I'm don't

1989.63 --> 1994.6000000000001
take steroids never have never will

1991.97 --> 1997.75
I'm not gonna inject any kind of [ __ ]

1994.6 --> 2000.79
but hey there's some really good

1997.75 --> 2007.83
Plante's out there it's perfectly legal

2000.79 --> 2007.83
and it's holistic in nature most of it

2009.87 --> 2014.8
No

2011.38 --> 2017.38
piss off I'm not gonna change anything

2014.8 --> 2018.97
about the way I look I might have some

2017.38 --> 2022.0600000000002
more basic clothes you don't know that

2018.97 --> 2025.54
because yeah all this blacks not exactly

2022.06 --> 2028.1499999999999
gonna help I just get some stupid basic

2025.54 --> 2032.23
clothing because I if I'm gonna do this

2028.15 --> 2034.1100000000001
[ __ ] I don't want to draw any any type

2032.23 --> 2037.96
of attention I want to look as

2034.11 --> 2040.54
retardedly generic as possible with as

2037.96 --> 2044.26
little amount of gay in it as possible

2040.54 --> 2045.96
that's doable and where I'm gonna be

2044.26 --> 2048.96
working at that will probably be very

2045.96 --> 2048.96
appreciated

2057.389 --> 2060.809
so yeah

2066.179 --> 2069.259
[Music]

2070.48 --> 2075.82
all right now you know what it may get

2073.179 --> 2077.56
weird again because I think that through

2075.82 --> 2081.46
where I'm gonna look at I'm probably

2077.56 --> 2086.44
gonna bump in more metal people because

2081.46 --> 2089.7400000000002
even back in the day when I was in the

2086.44 --> 2092.76
black metal stuff and all that the place

2089.74 --> 2098.29
where I happened to go to back then

2092.76 --> 2100.96
there were also like people that were

2098.29 --> 2103.839
doing exactly that type of job that I'm

2100.96 --> 2105.52
aiming at and they were metal guys they

2103.839 --> 2106.69
were not gothic at all they thought that

2105.52 --> 2110.56
was kind of silly

2106.69 --> 2111.339
pansy ish strongly disagreed with them

2110.56 --> 2113.23
at that time

2111.339 --> 2118.21
I might probably agree with them right

2113.23 --> 2120.67
now but yeah maybe it's gonna slide me

2118.21 --> 2124.839
back into the metal scene I'll be plenty

2120.67 --> 2127.51
of pissed off so that might actually

2124.839 --> 2133.56
work out I don't know where I will go

2127.51 --> 2133.5600000000004
after that if I even

2136.58 --> 2142.7
I don't even know yeah like at that

2140.9 --> 2144.92
point I'm gonna have to also take a

2142.7 --> 2146.75
careful look at the the path of Christ

2144.92 --> 2154.67
what I'm doing if that even makes sense

2146.75 --> 2157.52
anymore if just how because yeah if you

2154.67 --> 2161.78
change your entire stance on things and

2157.52 --> 2164.93
the way you look at things that certain

2161.78 --> 2166.8500000000004
consequences so not say well I'm giving

2164.93 --> 2171.08
up and the crease yet no that's just

2166.85 --> 2174.95
[ __ ] I'm not a [ __ ] just means

2171.08 --> 2177.83
that the way I probably am visualize the

2174.95 --> 2180.62
path to be for me is just not working

2177.83 --> 2186.38
that it's not gonna work out that way it

2180.62 --> 2193.04
was probably to idealize I overestimated

2186.38 --> 2198.4300000000003
my own influence severely because

2193.04 --> 2198.43
everybody knows me and that's about it

2202.29 --> 2207.39
although I do get mentioned with a

2205.41 --> 2211.83
summer I really do appreciate when

2207.39 --> 2214.41
people actually say oh look our win set

2211.83 --> 2216.48
this you conceptualize this back then

2214.41 --> 2218.7599999999998
and now we're talking about it I really

2216.48 --> 2220.08
like it when people do that and they do

2218.76 --> 2221.19
it rarely it's almost like they're

2220.08 --> 2224.69
afraid to do that

2221.19 --> 2224.69
sometimes it's weird

2241.82 --> 2248.1800000000003
are you trying to be a dick to me mother

2245.55 --> 2248.1800000000003

2262.28 --> 2273.8300000000004
three yeah thanks Amanda young for the

2266.36 --> 2275.33
$10 stupid donation is right I don't

2273.83 --> 2278.42
even know what that means at this point

2275.33 --> 2284.27
you know for some reason people like to

2278.42 --> 2287.8
call me that specifically I guess it

2284.27 --> 2287.8
means yeah he's good enough

2297.1 --> 2303.9
Oh think I didn't catch you there did

2301.87 --> 2303.9
you

2312.02 --> 2316.21
here's to see what your next war is we

2321.72 --> 2326.7799999999997
yeah I know Monsieur Salim thank you I

2324.42 --> 2330.2400000000002
guess

2326.78 --> 2333.21
if you phrase it like that yeah yeah

2330.24 --> 2337.7999999999997
that's exactly the issue that's exactly

2333.21 --> 2340.92
what I've been saying like hey it's not

2337.8 --> 2343.4100000000003
gonna roll in like and I mean on a

2340.92 --> 2346.53
constant basis and that doesn't mean

2343.41 --> 2349.5899999999997
would Google income because that

2346.53 --> 2354.69
literally just is nothing I appreciate

2349.59 --> 2356.88
the gesture I kind of like the idea that

2354.69 --> 2360.08
I can say look I have at least some

2356.88 --> 2362.9900000000002
income that's gonna be handed right back

2360.08 --> 2366.7799999999997
to compensate for the social welfare

2362.99 --> 2368.7299999999996
it's nice to say that it just doesn't do

2366.78 --> 2371.8700000000003
anything in practice it doesn't actually

2368.73 --> 2375.63
help me on the other hand well yeah

2371.87 --> 2378.42
amazing donations from from Rhys for

2375.63 --> 2381.9900000000002
example to my PayPal that absolutely

2378.42 --> 2384.57
helps a hundred percent very much I've

2381.99 --> 2387.45
been trying to emphasize this and even

2384.57 --> 2389.8500000000004
because of this I tried to shut down the

2387.45 --> 2392.7799999999997
super chat sounds kind of weird I don't

2389.85 --> 2395.7
know how to I couldn't turn it off I

2392.78 --> 2399.09
don't I don't know how to turn the super

2395.7 --> 2400.2599999999998
chants off once I turn it off I can't

2399.09 --> 2406.4700000000003
turn it off anymore

2400.26 --> 2408.75
what's it I mean I turn it on so so I'm

2406.47 --> 2414.24
just in this weird place where I'm

2408.75 --> 2417.03
feeling like it's just asymmetrical like

2414.24 --> 2420.3599999999997
I'm just a dancing bear here or

2417.03 --> 2423.4500000000003
something it's kind of funny though and

2420.36 --> 2427.11
that not that would relating to of

2423.45 --> 2428.97
course the Bears from Owen Benjamin but

2427.11 --> 2432.26
yeah the dancing bear is not a nice

2428.97 --> 2435.83
concept if you learn about it it's like

2432.26 --> 2440.5400000000004
circus bears or like carnival bears and

2435.83 --> 2442.86
they are treated pretty horribly like

2440.54 --> 2445.56
completely traumatized and then do

2442.86 --> 2448.2200000000003
tricks based on neurotic things it's

2445.56 --> 2450.9
horrifying well that's kinda the

2448.22 --> 2454.5899999999997
negative way to look at it of course I

2450.9 --> 2455.53
seem to be very talented really throwing

2454.59 --> 2458.92
down the dark

2455.53 --> 2461.8300000000004
here but that is sometimes how it feels

2458.92 --> 2464.7400000000002
like yeah I'm doing this okay I'm doing

2461.83 --> 2466.9
something and I can do and I get some

2464.74 --> 2470.41
appreciation it's not getting me

2466.9 --> 2478.56
anywhere though but that's kind of how

2470.41 --> 2481.5699999999997
it feels so yeah I know hazmat I know

2478.56 --> 2481.93
although they've been pretty neutral to

2481.57 --> 2487.0
me

2481.93 --> 2490.87
really I'm absolutely astonished that I

2487.0 --> 2491.59
haven't had a single strike I can't

2490.87 --> 2493.42
believe it

2491.59 --> 2495.6400000000003
there's been some videos kind of

2493.42 --> 2497.14
demonetised because we apparently had

2495.64 --> 2500.08
talked about the certain group of people

2497.14 --> 2501.7
that Google really doesn't appreciate it

2500.08 --> 2503.77
when I talk about it or a certain type

2501.7 --> 2506.2
of scenarios relating to the media that

2503.77 --> 2509.14
typically happened in order to inspire

2506.2 --> 2511.54
fear and that could turn out not to be

2509.14 --> 2513.87
real when I talk about that also it

2511.54 --> 2516.2799999999997
seems like my videos can be monetized

2513.87 --> 2519.63
just happens even if I just talk about

2516.28 --> 2522.8500000000004
it by accident if I get to any actual

2519.63 --> 2525.03
situation that's supposed to they happen

2522.85 --> 2525.0299999999997
I

2525.58 --> 2531.66
I know Reese you're the best I mean it

2528.37 --> 2531.66

2535.86 --> 2540.36

2551.7 --> 2557.0099999999998
that you do it right it should happen

2554.6 --> 2560.39
thank you so much for sharing that with

2557.01 --> 2562.5

2560.39 --> 2564.93
financially because that really helps

out but also because I know who's giving

2564.93 --> 2572.8799999999997

unrelenting great friend to me so thank

2612.64 --> 2620.5899999999997
want to see some actual Moo rectangular

2616.75 --> 2623.38
looping model talk go back to the first

2620.59 --> 2626.77
hangout or rewind this one at the

2623.38 --> 2629.92
beginning just the first few minutes I

2626.77 --> 2632.23
did talk about it or round it up what I

2629.92 --> 2634.7200000000003
did in the first show the rest is pretty

2632.23 --> 2643.0
much me just talking about me again and

2634.72 --> 2644.5
I don't know I think in retrospect there

2643.0 --> 2646.359
are some people here that appreciate

2644.5 --> 2648.28
that and there's probably a vast

2646.359 --> 2650.109
majority out there that just thinks it's

2648.28 --> 2652.21
a complete waste of time and they don't

2650.109 --> 2661.72
really want to get to know me that well

2652.21 --> 2663.33
I really do think so but yeah we'll see

2661.72 --> 2666.27
where it goes

2663.33 --> 2669.58
we'll see what happens when I actually

2666.27 --> 2672.7
all this energy invested in something

2669.58 --> 2675.19
and there's other ways to harvest from

2672.7 --> 2680.3199999999997
that instead of just talking for an hour

2675.19 --> 2683.589
every day and more so thanks everyone
