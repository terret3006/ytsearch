[Music]

34.649 --> 44.739000000000004

44.739 --> 48.19
Arwen and before we start the show

46.329 --> 50.17
please don't forget to share it and any

48.19 --> 51.669999999999995
platform you deem fit and also if you

50.17 --> 53.86

51.67 --> 55.57
and hit the bell notification so you

53.86 --> 56.44

55.57 --> 60.28
normally 2:00 p.m.

56.44 --> 63.04
Amsterdam time every day also please do

60.28 --> 65.58
support my channel through the my paypal

63.04 --> 69.25
patreon and my GoFundMe all in the

65.58 --> 73.42
description box below or the super chats

69.25 --> 77.89
if that's the only way so today is gonna

73.42 --> 81.52
be an interesting day but that's first

77.89 --> 89.979
the weather it's kind of nice kind of

81.52 --> 92.38
same like yesterday yeah it's been dry

89.979 --> 99.939
it's not windy it's nice sunny when the

92.38 --> 102.939
sun's out not behind the clouds and I

99.939 --> 108.25
got a no edibles Tamera coffee and tea

102.939 --> 111.60999999999999
and I think just a slight slight slight

108.25 --> 112.78
hangover because yesterday was a pretty

111.61 --> 119.71
crazy day

112.78 --> 123.159
stayed up relatively late and was

119.71 --> 125.77
interesting yeah I drank beers again and

123.159 --> 128.95000000000002
this time I was kind of getting stupid

125.77 --> 131.739
and took six probably well I handled it

128.95 --> 134.23
I got pretty good dinner and I feel okay

131.739 --> 138.51
but still I'm like okay stop doing that

134.23 --> 146.07
or when but yeah so the feud between

138.51 --> 152.04999999999998
Rasta and Trish continues in chats and I

146.07 --> 156.19
don't know Trish you do keep on behaving

152.05 --> 161.29000000000002
quite odd for a proclaimed Christian in

156.19 --> 164.16
chats fit towards me especially what

161.29 --> 167.28
yeah well there was a challenge set I

164.16 --> 172.54
don't remember which one of you did it

167.28 --> 178.05
but it was taken and so I made this this

172.54 --> 181.18
early bird show available for you to to

178.05 --> 184.65
work this out I don't know exactly what

181.18 --> 187.21
what you're going to be talking about I

184.65 --> 188.41
don't know if this is gonna turn into a

187.21 --> 192.4
shared fest

188.41 --> 194.59
I've no idea probably it's rust that

192.4 --> 198.45000000000002
doesn't come on a lot of the times I did

194.59 --> 198.45000000000002
it's probably gonna get interesting and

198.51 --> 211.85999999999999
he's ready to go and so it's Trish I

202.18 --> 218.92000000000002
think alright yeah let's try this out

211.86 --> 222.25
hold on let me get them together Rasta

218.92 --> 226.63
says he has a few issues with his phone

222.25 --> 231.52
so it might be shutting off and on let's

226.63 --> 233.2
hope it gets that stabilized wait before

231.52 --> 240.3
I go there let's just go through the

233.2 --> 245.67
chat and see who is here in the chat so

240.3 --> 245.67000000000002
let's see ya ATM was first

246.31 --> 254.83
Trish Blythe was also there pretty early

249.82 --> 257.23
Steve ruin Thorson and then rest assured

254.83 --> 261.34000000000003
up so yeah

257.23 --> 265.72
dummies can sprout lover Fyodor

261.34 --> 267.39
Dostoevsky but I'm good servant ego

265.72 --> 270.22
playing an anchor good to see you all

267.39 --> 271.93
hope more will come please don't forget

270.22 --> 284.11
to share this is this could get very

271.93 --> 288.64
interesting 23 watching it should be

284.11 --> 290.59000000000003
more a Ragnar Stefan Alderson now what

288.64 --> 296.53
I'm gonna wait until it shows at least

290.59 --> 299.61999999999995
30 and then I'm gonna call in Trish and

296.53 --> 301.15
Rasta so please don't forget to share

299.62 --> 304.86
this one this is going to be interesting

301.15 --> 304.85999999999996
I think one way or the other

306.15 --> 311.89
maybe somebody see if Paula is up would

309.94 --> 314.919
be interested this could get maybe

311.89 --> 315.81
biblical in some way and left if she's

314.919 --> 319.59
up for that

315.81 --> 324.85
probably not she doesn't really like the

319.59 --> 331.96
whipping around level of debate which is

324.85 --> 335.07000000000005
usually what Rasta excels at so 26 come

331.96 --> 335.07
on guys and girls

339.919 --> 354.29999999999995
dad christianity is not a religion oh I

349.49 --> 359.25
don't know other pens there there are

354.3 --> 360.62
the Christian religions I guess I do

359.25 --> 364.4
agree

360.62 --> 370.47
technically Christianity is a personal

364.4 --> 374.19
faith and a pathway a frequency a set of

370.47 --> 376.16900000000004
lessons that attune to creation itself

374.19 --> 379.229
that's what I consider Christianity

376.169 --> 384.71999999999997
that's what I say is the path that's

379.229 --> 388.229
what I tried to do and the Bible is the

384.72 --> 396.15000000000003
primary source of even the realization

388.229 --> 402.659
that this exists I think right now faith

396.15 --> 403.56
is not a religion faith is trusting on

402.659 --> 406.53
some things

403.56 --> 412.139
for various reasons that you don't have

406.53 --> 419.539
absolute confirmation of in a empirical

412.139 --> 419.539
sense that's all

423.64 --> 436.25
so ah 30 for watching okay this is good

431.83 --> 453.2
alright let's start this alright okay

436.25 --> 459.35
rest up let's call you first Trish hi

453.2 --> 463.03999999999996
Arwen hello I'm I'm doing good

459.35 --> 470.24
good morning or good afternoon where are

463.04 --> 476.6
you Estrella Wow yes wow so this is a

470.24 --> 479.24
true worldwide broadcast got somebody

476.6 --> 481.99
from Europe somebody from the United

479.24 --> 491.83
States and somebody from Australia

481.99 --> 491.83
interesting no Rome Ian or worldwide

492.7 --> 499.63
okay let's see if Resta can't get in

497.39 --> 499.63
here

507.87 --> 520.4
a [ __ ] good morning yeah you went to

516.18 --> 522.87
bed early and got up pretty early in yes

520.4 --> 526.14
hello I tried to take a nap for about an

522.87 --> 527.91
hour and a half unsuccessfully oh all

526.14 --> 531.15
right okay

527.91 --> 535.38
well uh yeah by the way your sounds a

531.15 --> 537.6
bit muff Li bit raw well Avenue might

535.38 --> 539.64
hear in headset so it might take a

537.6 --> 543.0
minute or here either getting used to

539.64 --> 549.8389999999999
her adjusting I can mute all right when

543.0 --> 552.089
I'm not talking okay see maybe you want

549.839 --> 553.86
to take a little bit more distance off

552.089 --> 555.0290000000001
your mic is that a possibility because

553.86 --> 561.48
it really sounds like you're almost

555.029 --> 564.96
chewing on it did my mic muted

561.48 --> 567.089
everything should be fine that's a

564.96 --> 578.279
little better yeah yeah anyway it's it's

567.089 --> 580.6800000000001
good enough well you're coming you are

578.279 --> 582.27
coming through so it's not a connection

580.68 --> 583.7399999999999
from I just thought that the sound

582.27 --> 586.38
quality could probably do a little

583.74 --> 589.97
better hoping that you would be able to

586.38 --> 592.5
take little distance off the mic itself

589.97 --> 595.47
but if that's not gonna work out then

592.5 --> 596.73
it'll do like I said just give me a

595.47 --> 601.86
couple of minutes here and we'll get it

596.73 --> 604.08
worked out all right so anyway

601.86 --> 605.97
it appeared that Trish had some personal

604.08 --> 608.19
issues that she was just a comment in

605.97 --> 609.72
YouTube about she wanted to address they

608.19 --> 611.73
don't have anything to do with me so I

609.72 --> 614.49
just figured I just go ahead and let her

611.73 --> 623.7
get that stuff cleared on her chest and

614.49 --> 634.77
won't have you as a oh let's not quibble

623.7 --> 637.6600000000001
over that basically you I'm a gypsy and

634.77 --> 639.74
my intentions were brought

637.66 --> 643.2199999999999
hey I didn't see their intentions were

639.74 --> 649.79
corrupt but B I did call you gypsy yeah

643.22 --> 653.0600000000001
I did and not because I necessarily know

649.79 --> 656.5999999999999
you they don't and not because I like

653.06 --> 659.5699999999999
Jose because I'd never met Jose I was on

656.6 --> 661.82
this show first time today and chance

659.57 --> 665.0600000000001
and I pulled you out because I just

661.82 --> 667.6400000000001
think it's a terrible thing to call

665.06 --> 670.1899999999999
someone out about losing his wife in his

667.64 --> 674.72
heart when they exceed that he was

670.19 --> 678.7700000000001
homeless and almost I think you've

674.72 --> 681.4100000000001
caught me pro-abortion before I checked

678.77 --> 682.61
I don't or [ __ ]

681.41 --> 685.52
so that wouldn't have been me there's

682.61 --> 687.29
it's not a topic I get into so I just

685.52 --> 689.63
called you out about that because hi

687.29 --> 692.149
we've all got difference of opinions

689.63 --> 694.64
it's the abortion issue is not about

692.149 --> 696.92
really I do not talk about abortion I do

694.64 --> 700.63
not bring up abortion I do yeah that was

696.92 --> 700.63
somebody else I'm pretty sure in chat

701.33 --> 707.39
[Music]

703.39 --> 709.0699999999999
you called out in chat wrong you called

707.39 --> 710.26
me out in chat on our wounds showed

709.07 --> 713.12
three days ago

710.26 --> 716.42
what the stuff Thursday was in the iron

713.12 --> 722.15
media chat so first you need to get your

716.42 --> 725.6899999999999
facts straight as to when I wonder you

722.15 --> 727.8199999999999
commented to Arwen Arwen you should let

725.69 --> 729.1700000000001
me come on the show so we can talk about

727.82 --> 732.589
what an idiot

729.17 --> 734.66
roster is that was the initial call out

732.589 --> 738.2
and that was in our one shift three days

734.66 --> 742.459
ago and so I responded to Arwen

738.2 --> 744.1400000000001
by all means Arwen any time and so it

742.459 --> 746.7199999999999
was just a matter of time until we ended

744.14 --> 749.23
up here but unfortunately you must have

746.72 --> 752.0
forgot about Arwen's show and all the

749.23 --> 754.88
nice little calling out you did in there

752.0 --> 758.779
long before we ever made it to the IR in

754.88 --> 761.6
chat when Jose came up yeah I agree to

758.779 --> 764.86
this so now that that's been assessed

761.6 --> 764.86
let's talk about Jose

766.4 --> 777.67
here's the laundry I while she basically

773.03 --> 777.67
said that she barely knows him so I

778.45 --> 784.21
speak out publicly about it so I feel

780.86 --> 784.21
that I should I would like to address it

785.2 --> 794.21
you said you declined you declined that

788.42 --> 796.88
Trish because I found it was just

794.21 --> 800.57
getting beyond crow you know you don't

796.88 --> 802.61
coming out yeah go back but you don't

800.57 --> 804.83
know the background of what happened

802.61 --> 808.82
with Jose okay there's a history with

804.83 --> 811.7
Jose as well that I have that we all had

808.82 --> 815.2700000000001
you obviously don't know since you just

811.7 --> 823.88
said that you just looked into him just

815.27 --> 835.6999999999999
now so they could be our worst enemy on

823.88 --> 836.96
a human level it's just great you're not

835.7 --> 838.4000000000001
gonna agree with everything of my

836.96 --> 840.11
restaurant gonna agree with everything

838.4 --> 844.4
you say I don't agree with you anyhow

840.11 --> 846.53
sighs I still hold on look don't try not

844.4 --> 847.81
to talk at the same time because then

846.53 --> 851.5699999999999
everything sets a cut-out

847.81 --> 852.8
what were you saying Resta I'm just

851.57 --> 855.83
wanting to know if I'm being heard at

852.8 --> 857.3299999999999
all because essentially once again all

855.83 --> 858.7700000000001
I'm looking for is an opportunity to

857.33 --> 860.87
address key issues that it didn't

858.77 --> 862.8199999999999
brought up against me culinary here and

860.87 --> 864.71
now she attempts to seem to want to stop

862.82 --> 868.73
me and addressing these issues that I've

864.71 --> 871.07
been called out for I yeah it would be

868.73 --> 873.9200000000001
good if you could just let rest that do

871.07 --> 880.5
his say he doesn't take too too long

873.92 --> 882.13
like Riley for example so continue

880.5 --> 884.93
[Music]

882.13 --> 888.83
but what's the last thing you were gonna

884.93 --> 890.5999999999999
address Resta i just want to take things

888.83 --> 893.24
one step at a time so we don't start

890.6 --> 895.6
scattered getting here so so the first

893.24 --> 897.86
thing to address was when she initially

895.6 --> 902.3000000000001
quote-unquote called me out to get on a

897.86 --> 906.25
panel and in a second was she that she

902.3 --> 910.01
decided to get so involved with was

906.25 --> 914.72
trolling Jose in the iron room media

910.01 --> 918.35
check Trish doesn't understand that

914.72 --> 922.34
these issues are more than two years old

918.35 --> 924.98
at the youngest these issues involve

922.34 --> 929.0
many people in the active flattered

924.98 --> 931.46
community Trish was not involved in any

929.0 --> 934.4
of these things not in any way shape or

931.46 --> 935.9000000000001
form she doesn't understand the context

934.4 --> 937.4599999999999
of the conversations she doesn't

935.9 --> 941.99
understand the context of the trolling

937.46 --> 945.44
involved so she doesn't have any context

941.99 --> 948.44
accuracy when she's commenting on other

945.44 --> 951.6400000000001
people's conversations in one way or

948.44 --> 956.0300000000001
another and to think that she does I

951.64 --> 959.51
mean just goes to show continued

956.03 --> 963.13
behavior that basically says that she's

959.51 --> 965.09
has an ego it's pretty unsurmountable

963.13 --> 967.01
that we've seen in a while

965.09 --> 969.77
as far as newcomers showing up and

967.01 --> 972.8
thinking that they're going to interject

969.77 --> 977.66
in other people's lives behaviors

972.8 --> 981.89
conversations and very dated issues and

977.66 --> 984.8
so I mean I think that Jose's responses

981.89 --> 987.23
to Trish were pretty clear everything

984.8 --> 992.42
I've said in chat to Jose

987.23 --> 995.72
I've said to Jose on panels since it

992.42 --> 998.65
started me and Jose were friends things

995.72 --> 1003.73
with Jose and I started to go downhill

998.65 --> 1006.49
when he decided to attain Gerrans p900

1003.73 --> 1008.6800000000001
in the method that he did and then

1006.49 --> 1010.9300000000001
couldn't proceeded to conduct himself

1008.68 --> 1014.3199999999999
the way that he did for the next I don't

1010.93 --> 1015.4499999999999
know eight to twelve months everybody's

1014.32 --> 1019.1800000000001
aware of it

1015.45 --> 1021.49
everybody was disgusted by it me it look

1019.18 --> 1024.01
probably at the least at some points and

1021.49 --> 1026.14
sometimes it the most but Jose

1024.01 --> 1028.62
understands these things he's aware of

1026.14 --> 1032.65
it he owns it he doesn't deny it

1028.62 --> 1035.319
and so therefore let adults handle

1032.65 --> 1037.959
adults but and let their problems

1035.319 --> 1043.26
between those adults be handled between

1037.959 --> 1044.65
those adults we don't painting offline

1043.26 --> 1046.87
privately

1044.65 --> 1048.91
that's not for these conversations we're

1046.87 --> 1051.9099999999999
taking know that it's a that Chadha are

1048.91 --> 1054.67
a common room it's a meeting place for a

1051.91 --> 1061.5700000000002
lot of flat earthers and ballers alike

1054.67 --> 1064.27
so that's not how it works back flat

1061.57 --> 1067.45
earthers flattery phase as some of the

1064.27 --> 1070.18
worst rolls to flat earthers in the

1067.45 --> 1072.94
world look at Patricia steal a beautiful

1070.18 --> 1074.92
one that was just totally trolled to the

1072.94 --> 1076.51
point of leaving like it's not doing

1074.92 --> 1079.0900000000001
anything for the conversation whatever

1076.51 --> 1081.1299999999999
your personal views are with Jose what

1079.09 --> 1084.1599999999999
he's done you know we all make mistakes

1081.13 --> 1086.0800000000002
we're human get over it and if you want

1084.16 --> 1088.69
to deal with it like an adult deal with

1086.08 --> 1091.0
it offline telling someone that their

1088.69 --> 1093.94
wife left them good job they're homeless

1091.0 --> 1095.32
I think it's disgusting and if I see

1093.94 --> 1101.89
that in the chat I'm going to call

1095.32 --> 1103.36
people out it's simple you are what

1101.89 --> 1110.68
you're talking about you're gonna get

1103.36 --> 1115.12
told that can we have a bit of human

1110.68 --> 1117.55
decency and that's why rusta you don't

1115.12 --> 1119.1699999999998
understand you don't understand that

1117.55 --> 1121.35
there is actually just someone out there

1119.17 --> 1123.3700000000001
we decided to give our and some money

1121.35 --> 1125.6799999999998
because I want to support our ones

1123.37 --> 1126.25
Channel there's no ulterior motive there

1125.68 --> 1129.4
Oh

1126.25 --> 1134.08
changing subjects now from Jose on to

1129.4 --> 1136.3000000000002
yourself I know no beef is rusty it's

1134.08 --> 1140.01
nothing to do with me will you brought

1136.3 --> 1140.01
it up in there Jacobs element to it

1145.12 --> 1153.55
come on don't talk through one another

1148.01 --> 1156.35
please it was embarrassing for you and

1153.55 --> 1160.58
laughable for me you're trying to pull

1156.35 --> 1162.26
support which is hilarious you're coming

1160.58 --> 1165.1
in as a new person and thinking that

1162.26 --> 1178.19
you're going to have some sort of like

1165.1 --> 1180.56
group supporting confused

1178.19 --> 1182.51
I don't need group support and I think

1180.56 --> 1187.09
anyone who's ever been in a chat with me

1182.51 --> 1187.09
well no but I don't need group support

1188.29 --> 1193.36
you're made you were whining about how

1191.24 --> 1203.69
nasty I was being to hos they

1193.36 --> 1204.62
continually making statements like but

1203.69 --> 1214.94
he's not done yet

1204.62 --> 1216.86
talking yet you can just wait it should

1214.94 --> 1219.25
have been and that's just goes to show

1216.86 --> 1222.25
once again you have an unrivaled ego

1219.25 --> 1222.25
okay

1222.86 --> 1227.9299999999998
oh really okay you make an assumption

1225.2 --> 1229.8500000000001
with you making assumptions about me you

1227.93 --> 1232.39
know it wouldn't even meet you don't

1229.85 --> 1232.3899999999999
know who I am

1233.02 --> 1239.3
chat you have a level of denial that's

1236.6 --> 1241.9699999999998
just shocking you can't make your own

1239.3 --> 1243.25
behavior and own it I mean it's just

1241.97 --> 1245.48
insane

1243.25 --> 1248.45
Marwin just called you out right now

1245.48 --> 1253.25
because what you just said is an

1248.45 --> 1255.5900000000001
absolute lie on a little child well you

1253.25 --> 1257.57
did attack him personally and look I

1255.59 --> 1262.33
don't know if you even remember this but

1257.57 --> 1265.3999999999999
you go way way too far also in chat and

1262.33 --> 1267.6799999999998
hey you may be doing it in response to

1265.4 --> 1271.3000000000002
somebody else but that's not the

1267.68 --> 1275.909
Christian way to do it I don't do that

1271.3 --> 1277.979
like unless there's like severe baller

1275.909 --> 1288.269
trickery going on and that's not the

1277.979 --> 1291.089
case well well then why do you claim

1288.269 --> 1296.1490000000001
that authority constantly towards other

1291.089 --> 1296.149
people yeah you're doing yes you do

1297.469 --> 1303.299
where I think we need to draw the line

1300.119 --> 1305.7189999999998
if someone's gonna get personal I'm

1303.299 --> 1308.369
gonna get personal back I don't go out

1305.719 --> 1310.769
purposely attacking anyone I saw the

1308.369 --> 1312.599
comment and thought it was disgusting to

1310.769 --> 1314.639
talk about someone when they're down and

1312.599 --> 1317.6689999999999
out like that whatever your beef is

1314.639 --> 1319.2289999999998
outside of the cyber world deal with

1317.669 --> 1320.009
that we're all human we all make

1319.229 --> 1322.769
mistakes

1320.009 --> 1324.989
calling me an egotistical person you

1322.769 --> 1327.719
don't know me from a bear aside I'm a

1324.989 --> 1329.309
kind-hearted generous person you don't

1327.719 --> 1331.469
know that about me because you called me

1329.309 --> 1334.799
a gypsy because you think I gave money

1331.469 --> 1337.709
to Alan to manipulate his what are you

1334.799 --> 1340.649
that no no that's no hold on that's

1337.709 --> 1344.3390000000002
actually me that thought that and I

1340.649 --> 1347.1899999999998
spoke out about that and I'm just

1344.339 --> 1353.129
letting it be and letting it be what it

1347.19 --> 1355.799
is because yes you're right and after

1353.129 --> 1357.349
you actually talked about foolish and I

1355.799 --> 1360.179
went over and I watched all those

1357.349 --> 1362.9689999999998
awesome shoutout to Paul that these look

1360.179 --> 1365.279
some great content and years potentially

1362.969 --> 1366.419
I was being a bit of a salesperson and I

1365.279 --> 1371.399
apologize for that

1366.419 --> 1373.7990000000002
thank my intention my intention was

1371.399 --> 1375.899
always pure and I've always been here to

1373.799 --> 1377.759
support your channel I questioned you

1375.899 --> 1380.5189999999998
because I think Hillary Clinton had no

1377.759 --> 1383.69
intention of breaking down yeah that's a

1380.519 --> 1390.869
bit of a low blow there come on Reza

1383.69 --> 1395.489
right look intention has nothing to do

1390.869 --> 1399.6589999999999
with outcome it doesn't mater rest of

1395.489 --> 1400.6490000000001
the intention me talking to Ireland

1399.659 --> 1404.159
about Father

1400.649 --> 1406.86
okay by the bancini FINA salesperson was

1404.159 --> 1410.7990000000002
wrong I fully admit that

1406.86 --> 1413.83
my delivery was incorrect but the

1410.799 --> 1418.299
intention my motivation behind the act

1413.83 --> 1419.58
was absolute pure motivations are

1418.299 --> 1423.58
irrelevant

1419.58 --> 1431.499
Ivanhoe motivations every sir no it's

1423.58 --> 1433.96
really the act no it's - no look the

1431.499 --> 1437.44
story behind what drive you is

1433.96 --> 1443.8600000000001
inconsequential to the actual activities

1437.44 --> 1446.3790000000001
that you do and not know I'm not talking

1443.86 --> 1449.35
about heavy sins I'm talking about minor

1446.379 --> 1453.549
sins and if you persist at them then you

1449.35 --> 1463.1789999999999
are unrepentant at them and then that

1453.549 --> 1466.72
that has certain effects that's all no

1463.179 --> 1468.6100000000001
I'm talking about the laws of God

1466.72 --> 1470.08
no and in the court of law intention

1468.61 --> 1472.9599999999998
makes no difference when you commit a

1470.08 --> 1474.73
crime also found guilty of that right it

1472.96 --> 1477.8500000000001
doesn't matter what your intentions were

1474.73 --> 1479.679
if you committed the crime and that's it

1477.85 --> 1482.619
it doesn't matter what your intentions

1479.679 --> 1484.659
were you accidentally ran down four

1482.619 --> 1490.059
people in a crosswalk basically what you

1484.659 --> 1495.3400000000001
were driving down the street you're

1490.059 --> 1497.47
still gonna pay the price for that if

1495.34 --> 1499.84
you accidentally hit someone in your car

1497.47 --> 1503.08
it's manslaughter if you intentionally

1499.84 --> 1504.279
get in your car with the mindset you're

1503.08 --> 1506.499
gonna run someone over there's

1504.279 --> 1508.539
first-degree murder of course intention

1506.499 --> 1510.8500000000001
exactly and I'm not saying that you win

1508.539 --> 1512.559
in anything intent to murder or with a

1510.85 --> 1516.369
bad intent I'm just saying in the end

1512.559 --> 1519.19
four people still died the act in the

1516.369 --> 1533.9189999999999
field is what really counts as a

1519.19 --> 1540.4
baseline oh did you get me to do that

1533.919 --> 1543.0900000000001
really here again no no you didn't I

1540.4 --> 1551.02
I've embraced the Bible a long time ago

1543.09 --> 1555.9099999999999
this seed but you just assumed these

1551.02 --> 1559.21
things without asking or when I try to

1555.91 --> 1563.2
explain it you don't respond you don't

1559.21 --> 1566.95
hear it when I say yes I have went

1563.2 --> 1569.5
through my things I've been to church I

1566.95 --> 1572.38
have talked about the Bible read into

1569.5 --> 1574.9
the Bible heard a lot of quotes and

1572.38 --> 1577.39
things by good people and that is the

1574.9 --> 1581.0500000000002
way I can actually absorb it because if

1577.39 --> 1584.5900000000001
there is some kind of offensive or just

1581.05 --> 1587.08
a nag kind of attitude omits all that it

1584.59 --> 1590.29
doesn't work for me I explained this

1587.08 --> 1593.02
very specifically that that nag among it

1590.29 --> 1598.3899999999999
is exactly what drove me into the arms

1593.02 --> 1601.51
of the atheists in my youth so I for one

1598.39 --> 1608.3500000000001
want to get that away look the Bible

1601.51 --> 1611.8
should be about purity about truly no

1608.35 --> 1614.4099999999999
longer needing to take part into into

1611.8 --> 1617.26
deceptive methods and trickery because

1614.41 --> 1619.96
the actual strength you're wielding from

1617.26 --> 1622.45
doing it right is so strong that you can

1619.96 --> 1627.49
just bypass it change the game

1622.45 --> 1631.75
completely that that is what I want to

1627.49 --> 1634.66
try to do that's why it's so important

1631.75 --> 1638.74
to keep it as strict as possible when

1634.66 --> 1641.19
you conduct yourself wherever you can

1638.74 --> 1641.19
anyway

1644.34 --> 1653.05
it's still there I actually so actually

1649.54 --> 1655.06
just so you know Alan I have been a big

1653.05 --> 1657.69
supporter of yours you know and I like

1655.06 --> 1663.6699999999998
still and I've well I think you do

1657.69 --> 1666.39
wonderful I came about and why why the

1663.67 --> 1669.76
motivation is for me to want to support

1666.39 --> 1671.8000000000002
people like you and Randy and you know

1669.76 --> 1674.47
sleeping warrior is because when I first

1671.8 --> 1677.11
the first ever live chat i catched with

1674.47 --> 1678.91
Brandi it's basically saying that he

1677.11 --> 1681.01
wanted to give it away sick of the

1678.91 --> 1682.8100000000002
trolls you know he didn't think the

1681.01 --> 1685.6299999999999
movement was going anywhere it was just

1682.81 --> 1687.9099999999999
turning into a big fight you know he was

1685.63 --> 1690.4
really down hard and his mother was ill

1687.91 --> 1692.43
at the time you know there were a lot of

1690.4 --> 1696.43
things going on from and I basically

1692.43 --> 1698.3500000000001
gave him some encouraging words and and

1696.43 --> 1700.72
you know inflicted him a super check

1698.35 --> 1703.09
because in prayed for him because I

1700.72 --> 1706.26
thought he was someone who's adding

1703.09 --> 1708.4599999999998
something to them to to the movement

1706.26 --> 1711.67
actually physically going out and doing

1708.46 --> 1714.01
observations and you know look at Randy

1711.67 --> 1715.75
now and I'm not saying that's because it

1714.01 --> 1718.27
means that I'm saying that's because of

1715.75 --> 1721.39
all of the support that he got when he

1718.27 --> 1723.49
was really down in the dumps mm-hmm and

1721.39 --> 1725.47
that's why I when I've seen you on

1723.49 --> 1727.6
numerous occasions where you just wish

1725.47 --> 1730.3600000000001
mean everything you wish snake your

1727.6 --> 1732.1299999999999
channel we where you fit in things all I

1730.36 --> 1735.52
wanted to provide you with some

1732.13 --> 1737.95
inspiration from just little old me you

1735.52 --> 1742.06
hear on Australia hanging upside down

1737.95 --> 1745.15
somewhere to say keep going you know

1742.06 --> 1747.6399999999999
you've got a lot to add to the

1745.15 --> 1750.67
conversation and I think when we get

1747.64 --> 1751.99
personal and emotional and all of that I

1750.67 --> 1756.43
think of the traits from the

1751.99 --> 1761.46
conversation well yeah that was kind of

1756.43 --> 1769.0900000000001
my point the conversation into personal

1761.46 --> 1772.1100000000001
bullying shoving manipulation no no you

1769.09 --> 1773.86
don't that's not true Trish you like

1772.11 --> 1776.74
shoving Arlen

1773.86 --> 1778.6589999999999
you've been trying to subtly do it with

1776.74 --> 1781.8700000000001
money and doing all these different

1778.659 --> 1784.44
things means you've won per slide

1781.87 --> 1789.309
nobody's business I mean it's insane

1784.44 --> 1793.6490000000001
Rasta you don't need to be smelted but

1789.309 --> 1793.649
I'm speaking from myself

1797.97 --> 1803.2
I called you out because you see to a

1801.039 --> 1804.34
man who was down on his life you know

1803.2 --> 1807.1000000000001
good job

Oh hold me out in Arwen show three days

1807.1 --> 1812.3799999999999

because you because you would have had a

1812.38 --> 1815.8600000000001

1831.279 --> 1836.38
said oh but he wouldn't let me on

1833.169 --> 1839.6490000000001
because I'll talk truth and he'll block

1836.38 --> 1841.029
me and I said hmm I don't think so we

1839.649 --> 1844.029
can do this any time

1841.029 --> 1846.37
it's only a skype away and then three

1844.029 --> 1849.279
days later you started trying to

1871.99 --> 1875.35
think that you had any idea what I'm

1873.76 --> 1877.179
talking about because everything you

1875.35 --> 1879.76
said still proves that you have no idea

1877.179 --> 1882.25
what any of this is about you don't know

1879.76 --> 1887.59
any of the people involved and with

1882.25 --> 1889.539
everything that you said maybe to

1887.59 --> 1896.3799999999999
support your behavior with your

1889.539 --> 1901.09
intentions what your beef is with Jose

1896.38 --> 1903.88
I've told you out I'm not talking about

1901.09 --> 1906.01
Jose I'm talking about you every time I

1903.88 --> 1907.0
start to talk about you you like to

1906.01 --> 1910.36
offer you skate

1907.0 --> 1916.539
first you deny your own behavior like

1910.36 --> 1918.7299999999998
what no no don't red herring the issue

1916.539 --> 1921.01
we're talking about the overall chat

1918.73 --> 1923.409
behavior and just pushing me around

1921.01 --> 1925.57
pushing others around even once that

1923.409 --> 1928.0
people in chat that I know that I try to

1925.57 --> 1930.85
defend me when you do that for no reason

1928.0 --> 1931.299
because I don't actually actively attack

1930.85 --> 1934.3899999999999
you

1931.299 --> 1936.549
sometimes describe your behavior but I

1934.39 --> 1939.13
don't engage in attacking you might not

1936.549 --> 1954.039
have really noticed too much because

1939.13 --> 1959.44
you're too busy doing your thing when

1954.039 --> 1962.11
who when no-no-no gingery claiming now

1959.44 --> 1969.789
that you have been attacked so when did

1962.11 --> 1972.61
I do that and this is me a hundred

1969.789 --> 1974.59
percent rolling right everyone says be

1972.61 --> 1977.9799999999998
happy with yourself like yourself what

1974.59 --> 1981.07
did i do what did i do on your show the

1977.98 --> 1983.799
other night when I said I'm high and

1981.07 --> 1987.8999999999999
beautiful right what happened what

1983.799 --> 1991.33
happened Darwin you called me bang

1987.9 --> 1998.47
that's not attacking that's not an

1991.33 --> 2000.96
attack that's a description right yeah

1998.47 --> 2002.19
but you're taking things out of context

2000.96 --> 2004.289
though you're taking things out of

2002.19 --> 2008.22
context because because right before

2004.289 --> 2011.37
that you first said no I am used pretty

2008.22 --> 2013.95
much roughly said that you were perfect

2011.37 --> 2016.6499999999999
and all that you went very far it was

2013.95 --> 2019.26
almost like you were slightly tipsy or

2016.65 --> 2022.26
something because it was just way off

2019.26 --> 2024.69
and then you proceeded to make all these

2022.26 --> 2026.21
consecutive hold on us then you

2024.69 --> 2029.549
proceeded to make all these consecutive

2026.21 --> 2033.539
statements about yourself basically

2029.549 --> 2036.87
phrasing yourself in a very odd awkward

2033.539 --> 2038.94
moment and you don't seem to realize

2036.87 --> 2042.6599999999999
this in the spot it's

2038.94 --> 2044.88
weird Allen I didn't because it is odd

2042.66 --> 2048.56
because don't you find it odd that

2044.88 --> 2052.38
you've got all the so-called support

2048.56 --> 2057.87
there where are they where are they

2052.38 --> 2060.78
they're in my chat no they're not some

2057.87 --> 2063.0899999999997
of them are some of them are trolling

2060.78 --> 2065.82
and when they're trolling bad I kicked

2063.09 --> 2068.4300000000003
them the trolls that are in here like

2065.82 --> 2072.6600000000003
Lottie for example actually he is a

2068.43 --> 2074.91
troll but he he knows how to behave he

2072.66 --> 2077.37
knows where not to go in order for him

2074.91 --> 2081.21
to stay in there because he kind of

2077.37 --> 2083.52
finds it amusing and I I just managed my

2081.21 --> 2086.82
chat in a very particular way in it kind

2083.52 --> 2089.1
of works it's quite varied and still

2086.82 --> 2092.73
stable which is kind of unique on the

2089.1 --> 2109.08
scene if you ask me so I don't see the

2092.73 --> 2111.66
problem here because you because of just

2109.08 --> 2118.17
the overall picture is do as I say not

2111.66 --> 2121.47
as I do that that's it it's it's it's

2118.17 --> 2141.08
the do as I say not as I do attitude

2121.47 --> 2145.47
Trish that's inappropriate behavior at

2141.08 --> 2148.59
certain times do you realise that when

2145.47 --> 2152.6099999999997
things are tense when things are tense

2148.59 --> 2154.77
and you do that you may find some relief

2152.61 --> 2156.69
in it but yes you're putting it out

2154.77 --> 2163.38
there that's not going to be the effect

2156.69 --> 2165.33
on other people yeah but why do you do

2163.38 --> 2167.1
if you know that then why do you do that

2165.33 --> 2169.13
because you've done that in multiple

2167.1 --> 2169.13
occasions

2170.94 --> 2174.93
and and refuses to address or even debut

2172.98 --> 2176.94
she just refuses to address it I'm

2174.93 --> 2180.21
addressing it now roster if you can get

2176.94 --> 2183.569
the squeaky mark off okay

2180.21 --> 2185.789
well address it then please sometimes I

2183.569 --> 2189.0
say things and tongue and cheek do you

2185.789 --> 2193.369
know what the st. Anne chief is right

2189.0 --> 2197.339
I'm joking around and all of a sudden

2193.369 --> 2201.78
your trigger or rust the cat's triggered

2197.339 --> 2203.609
us to have it it's a joke you know is

2201.78 --> 2208.6800000000003
everyone lost their sense of humors

2203.609 --> 2210.089
everyone lost their funny undies I think

2208.68 --> 2215.3999999999996
we're more than intelligent enough to

2210.089 --> 2218.7889999999998
recognize jokes Galatian and pressuring

2215.4 --> 2221.369
by still bullying I mean you're really

2218.789 --> 2225.059
just obvious dating making behaviors to

2221.369 --> 2227.4900000000002
play it off with simple things and we

2225.059 --> 2229.92
all see what's going on here I don't

2227.49 --> 2232.52
know maybe this maybe this is like a

2229.92 --> 2235.619
cultural maybe that is what you call

2232.52 --> 2238.049
Trish a gypsy for maybe this is like a

2235.619 --> 2241.02
cultural misunderstanding and she just

2238.049 --> 2244.529
finds certain types of things funny and

2241.02 --> 2247.109
amusing that we don't we find it

2244.529 --> 2251.76
annoying and obfuscating your

2247.109 --> 2254.49
spirituality is not jokes yeah that's my

2251.76 --> 2256.7400000000002
point as well Rasta we look Rasta me

2254.49 --> 2260.5789999999997
Rasta for here all his attitude in his

2256.74 --> 2263.7599999999998
opinions he's very serious okay

2260.579 --> 2266.099
we don't joke around about real serious

2263.76 --> 2268.71
things like this because we do take it

2266.099 --> 2272.2200000000003
serious and it's just odd that you're

2268.71 --> 2276.65
being so casual about it yet using it as

2272.22 --> 2279.029
a as a primary thing you're doing

2276.65 --> 2287.7000000000003
telling others you should be more

2279.029 --> 2290.94
Christian I live in Australia or New

2287.7 --> 2292.77
Zealand Kiwis in Australia take the

2290.94 --> 2295.859
[ __ ] out of people all the time it's

2292.77 --> 2298.38
what we do it's like Owen Benjamin right

2295.859 --> 2301.109
right when I know you follow him right

2298.38 --> 2303.9900000000002
I'm getting really really frustrated by

2301.109 --> 2304.91
this [ __ ] Arwen I again he thinks

2303.99 --> 2309.45
that we don't

2304.91 --> 2311.3999999999996
well Rasta look look Rasta if you if you

2309.45 --> 2312.66
want to just leave or something and go

2311.4 --> 2315.12
to bed I would totally agree

2312.66 --> 2318.0299999999997
everything's been spoken out the things

2315.12 --> 2320.31
have been laid down and I don't know I

2318.03 --> 2325.11
unless you had another point you wanted

2320.31 --> 2329.16
to make statements in chat she has no

2325.11 --> 2330.3900000000003
concept of timeline just no come on let

2329.16 --> 2334.1099999999997
her let him finish

2330.39 --> 2336.45
let him finish Trish please all she does

2334.11 --> 2337.8
is want this every time that I begin to

2336.45 --> 2340.2599999999998
actually give him my wine and the

2337.8 --> 2343.1400000000003
sequence of events accurately took place

2340.26 --> 2345.5600000000004
that's a mall walkable in chat it's all

2343.14 --> 2348.5699999999997
there to see she just sits there and

2345.56 --> 2351.06
immediately starts talking and closing

2348.57 --> 2358.5
the gate and then obfuscating and tries

2351.06 --> 2369.06
to grow again have no absolutely nothing

2358.5 --> 2370.92
to do with the topics you don't even

2369.06 --> 2372.66
exactly know what he was saying because

2370.92 --> 2389.4900000000002
she were talking through it half of the

2372.66 --> 2390.18
time timelines about what you called him

2389.49 --> 2393.3599999999997
out

2390.18 --> 2395.2799999999997
we called you out in your response to us

2393.36 --> 2400.4300000000003
calling you out is it's just it was just

2395.28 --> 2400.4300000000003
a joke that is what you're doing

2400.97 --> 2405.18
no but everything else that we've

2403.47 --> 2407.52
complained about that led to that

2405.18 --> 2410.3999999999996
situation you're just saying I don't get

2407.52 --> 2414.08
why you don't get my humor well clearly

2410.4 --> 2414.08
it didn't end up in a funny situation

2417.77 --> 2424.62
when I say permission to ask you a

2420.69 --> 2426.9500000000003
question please do you think this is

2424.62 --> 2429.69
ridiculous we're not stupid

2426.95 --> 2431.7599999999998
well do you think that I'm being serious

2429.69 --> 2436.82
when I say permission to ask mission

2431.76 --> 2436.82
please no because when I'm talking about

2437.46 --> 2446.65
chewing and your religious bling and

2440.23 --> 2450.43
spiritual judging of people Wow

2446.65 --> 2458.109
once again zero zero self self

2450.43 --> 2460.69
reflection absolutely no but you hold

2458.109 --> 2463.09
other people in judgment non-stop or

2460.69 --> 2472.15
one's oh I'm wondering what type of

2463.09 --> 2474.94
Christian she is really ridiculous no

2472.15 --> 2479.7400000000002
listening no watching nutritious food

2474.94 --> 2483.25
now I haven't taken that much notice of

2479.74 --> 2485.22
you to be honest this is just fine

2483.25 --> 2487.17
because we all took note of you

2485.22 --> 2490.2099999999996
excellent

2487.17 --> 2493.1800000000003
Trish can I ask you what type of

2490.21 --> 2502.57
Christian are you could you elaborate a

2493.18 --> 2505.1499999999996
little on that no I wasn't asking about

2502.57 --> 2507.07
if if your religion is prayer are

2505.15 --> 2509.14
perfect I'm just wondering since you

2507.07 --> 2512.25
assisted that I got a Bible now that

2509.14 --> 2516.25
that seems to fall into certain type of

2512.25 --> 2518.2
religious way to go about in certain

2516.25 --> 2521.109
circles so I'm just wondering what part

2518.2 --> 2526.54
what church are you or have you been a

2521.109 --> 2528.64
part of after partaking in yeah I get

2526.54 --> 2530.47
that what what time is that the church

2528.64 --> 2532.75
if you wanted a part when to rip him to

2530.47 --> 2537.6899999999996
you said rip him to us tomorrow in and

2532.75 --> 2546.43
all that was probably a joke line but

2537.69 --> 2548.589
yeah she did nobody look this is a hold

2546.43 --> 2554.3489999999997
on guys this is red herring to sit I

2548.589 --> 2556.81
haven't Rasta Resta look this is all

2554.349 --> 2560.32
just red herring my point I still want

2556.81 --> 2562.5299999999997
to know what type of church specific

2560.32 --> 2565.0
Christian Church because it's not just a

2562.53 --> 2568.0600000000004
Christian Church a Christian Church

2565.0 --> 2569.79
don't exist what Christian Church have

2568.06 --> 2573.67
you partaken in

2569.79 --> 2577.39
I've got one Christian Church and it's

2573.67 --> 2581.52
we believe in Jesus Christ God the

2577.39 --> 2588.4
Father the Holy Spirit okay so which

2581.52 --> 2594.57
Christian Church it's called its Calvary

2588.4 --> 2594.57
Church Calvary Calvary with a V no it's

2594.69 --> 2600.04
alright alright okay thank you that's

2597.76 --> 2602.32
all I wanted to know now we got some

2600.04 --> 2606.7
kind of anchor point to reference this

2602.32 --> 2609.55
always so okay I don't know anything

2606.7 --> 2617.3799999999997
about that church group so can't really

2609.55 --> 2620.4700000000003
comment on it at this point saying we

2617.38 --> 2623.71
believe in God the Father Jesus Christ

2620.47 --> 2625.48
died for us and was resurrected in the

2623.71 --> 2628.09
Holy Spirit right well that's most

2625.48 --> 2630.27
Christian churches that doesn't there's

2628.09 --> 2633.31
more to it than just that with churches

2630.27 --> 2635.44
there's also just what they do do they

2633.31 --> 2637.119
have any icons do they have any specific

2635.44 --> 2645.52
type of tree there's so many churches

2637.119 --> 2650.65
these days it's nuts so but okay the

2645.52 --> 2652.66
church what be church it's the Catholic

2650.65 --> 2655.4500000000003
Church okay yeah sure that's very

2652.66 --> 2658.8999999999996
blatantly obvious especially because

2655.45 --> 2661.33
Jesus himself made it plenty obvious

2658.9 --> 2663.9
that the church should not be an

2661.33 --> 2667.21
organization it should be an individual

2663.9 --> 2669.099
bomb the individual priesthood the

2667.21 --> 2671.56
person should be their own church and

2669.099 --> 2673.51
you can gather but you can't give your

2671.56 --> 2675.73
authority to somebody else your

2673.51 --> 2679.6600000000003
spiritual authority because then you

2675.73 --> 2682.45
yeah you take away the bond with God so

2679.66 --> 2685.66
organized religion almost all of it is

2682.45 --> 2688.21
by default then bad it's it's a complex

2685.66 --> 2690.339
issue to get around but that doesn't

2688.21 --> 2693.67
mean that you couldn't have partaken in

2690.339 --> 2696.07
a church just like I joined the Mormons

2693.67 --> 2697.7200000000003
for a while and they are a Christian

2696.07 --> 2699.849
whatever you think of their Book of

2697.72 --> 2701.47
Mormon they are Christian and they do

2699.849 --> 2705.67
believe in the inn

2701.47 --> 2719.3489999999997
the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost so

2705.67 --> 2722.589
and all that I don't yeah they do yet

2719.349 --> 2725.05
now they believe he is God incarnated in

2722.589 --> 2734.95
the flesh so yeah yeah and he's

2725.05 --> 2737.1400000000003
addressed as the son of God not the

2734.95 --> 2739.27
Mormons mostly have just a different

2737.14 --> 2741.94
view on how heaven is like it's quite

2739.27 --> 2743.23
fascinating actually just talking about

2741.94 --> 2749.44
the book of jesus christ and latter-day

2743.23 --> 2752.609
saints yes there is I I have one

2749.44 --> 2755.41
actually yeah there's a book of war

2752.609 --> 2757.3289999999997
basically and then they go through what

2755.41 --> 2762.5989999999997
umbrella is which is the Church of Jesus

2757.329 --> 2762.599
Christ of latter-day saints or LDS yeah

2762.81 --> 2767.67
so anyway that is some of my background

2773.55 --> 2778.599
celebrate on Saturdays it's entirely

2775.839 --> 2780.52
different would you yes no it's very

2778.599 --> 2783.4900000000002
different and they're pretty big by the

2780.52 --> 2785.53
way they're everywhere and it's it's

2783.49 --> 2788.9799999999996
qur'anic because they had the latter-day

2785.53 --> 2791.67
saints have a tradition the typical

2788.98 --> 2795.88
tradition among churchgoers to send out

2791.67 --> 2798.28
their teenagers to other countries to

2795.88 --> 2800.29
basically join other latter-day saint

2798.28 --> 2804.67
churches all around the world and like

2800.29 --> 2808.15
it's a real it's like a it's like a

2804.67 --> 2810.16
tradition to do that and for boys and

2808.15 --> 2812.38
girls it's it's pretty fascinating and I

2810.16 --> 2815.29
totally get why they're literally

2812.38 --> 2819.3
everywhere in the world Asia Africa

2815.29 --> 2819.3
South America everywhere

2821.0 --> 2825.17
Schrader's I don't know with you the

2822.44 --> 2826.73
motorsport Rugby League but we were too

2825.17 --> 2829.13
famous rugby league playing here in

2826.73 --> 2831.92
Australia we've had to basically put his

2829.13 --> 2834.59
career on hold while he went off and did

2831.92 --> 2836.7200000000003
that his two-year mission and he gave up

2834.59 --> 2841.8500000000004
millions of dollars with a contractor to

2836.72 --> 2844.8199999999997
do that right yeah yeah so yeah I mean

2841.85 --> 2846.89
we do obviously Ricky Williams gave up

2844.82 --> 2853.1000000000004
millions of dollars whole contracts just

2846.89 --> 2857.54
smoked marijuana I'll be back

2853.1 --> 2862.25
continue I was just saying that NFL

2857.54 --> 2864.61
player and star Ricky Williams quit the

2862.25 --> 2868.3
NFL for three years before they

2864.61 --> 2870.2000000000003
legalized cannabis consumption and

2868.3 --> 2873.59
decided but it was more important to

2870.2 --> 2877.0699999999997
start medical cannabis corporation then

2873.59 --> 2879.2000000000003
take 47 million dollars a year for three

2877.07 --> 2882.5
years from the NFL pretty impressive and

2879.2 --> 2887.96
then go back and then he went back to

2882.5 --> 2889.76
the NFL money in the medical cannabis

2887.96 --> 2892.76
industries wow there's a bit of money in

2889.76 --> 2899.1800000000003
there oh yeah no doubt but it was only

2892.76 --> 2901.76
about I'd say 0.5% of what he was making

2899.18 --> 2903.29
like in the NFL right Lee when you

2901.76 --> 2905.8100000000004
launch the company's over here when it

2903.29 --> 2907.55
comes to medical cannabis you unless you

2905.81 --> 2908.72
have massive Corp or backing and whatnot

2907.55 --> 2911.96
you're really not going to run in the

2908.72 --> 2915.2599999999998
profit for commute at five years yeah

2911.96 --> 2917.81
Troy Troy we don't

2915.26 --> 2919.7000000000003
marijuana's well I think in some states

2917.81 --> 2921.68
in Australia you you're allowed a little

2919.7 --> 2925.7799999999997
bit of personal use but it's yeah it's

2921.68 --> 2929.06
pretty much illegal to have it here

2925.78 --> 2930.17
well now the Rhondda less touchy topics

2929.06 --> 2931.73
here let's talk about something else

2930.17 --> 2933.6800000000003
that's funny about Australia and laws

2931.73 --> 2936.19
I'm really interested in the fact that

2933.68 --> 2940.16
they don't allow smokeless tobacco in

2936.19 --> 2944.87
Australia it's my blister back up never

2940.16 --> 2947.72
heard of it Rasta what is that basically

2944.87 --> 2950.0299999999997
it's usually an oral tobacco they'll

2947.72 --> 2954.89
call it chewing tobacco or dip tobacco

2950.03 --> 2957.4700000000003
or German nasal snuff or Swedish

2954.89 --> 2961.609
they're all forms of tobacco consumption

2957.47 --> 2965.4199999999996
that are not smoking I have I have I

2961.609 --> 2967.009
have heard of chewing tobacco and no

2965.42 --> 2972.259
that's never been a thing in Australia

2967.009 --> 2975.89
or New Zealand it's been yeah yeah never

2972.259 --> 2978.259
ever ever been allowed here yeah like

2975.89 --> 2983.15
pretty much everywhere is smoke free

2978.259 --> 2986.839
here now so you know and cigarettes are

2983.15 --> 2988.9700000000003
very very expensive so what getting onto

2986.839 --> 2991.97
something else I find ironic that the

2988.97 --> 2997.1899999999996
biggest population of smokers is

2991.97 --> 2999.95
actually Asians and they have the least

2997.19 --> 3002.0190000000002
cancer and this aside here let me make

2999.95 --> 3003.64
it one comment on that and then make a

3002.019 --> 3005.2
couple of statements to conclude our

3003.64 --> 3009.0389999999998
previous business if you don't mind is

3005.2 --> 3010.1499999999996
that okay with you yeah sure okay first

3009.039 --> 3011.619
I'll just address that little comment

3010.15 --> 3013.7490000000003
you made about Asians and their lack of

3011.619 --> 3015.7000000000003
cancer that's because they're the

3013.749 --> 3019.2099999999996
tobacco industry's been being gas-lit by

3015.7 --> 3021.7
the US government and how the european

3019.21 --> 3025.869
government for decades policy so you

3021.7 --> 3028.3289999999997
think the states are forged yeah no but

3025.869 --> 3031.329
agents will have the opportunity and

3028.329 --> 3034.8390000000004
tendency to make their own sorry like

3031.329 --> 3037.96
that sorry anyways there's been so many

3034.839 --> 3039.819
provable improving health properties and

3037.96 --> 3041.44
benefits of nicotine but it usually

3039.819 --> 3043.18
simply comes down to the delivery method

3041.44 --> 3046.7490000000003
is where you're gonna have carcinogenic

3043.18 --> 3050.549
production I can use in the form of

3046.749 --> 3052.749
smoke and so basically the quote unquote

3050.549 --> 3055.989
potential illnesses they're gonna be

3052.749 --> 3057.6699999999996
incurred through that smoke are gonna be

3055.989 --> 3060.339
the same no matter what type of smoke

3057.67 --> 3064.2690000000002
that you're inhaling if it was a car

3060.339 --> 3066.609
fire a forest fire a cigarette exactly

3064.269 --> 3069.1899999999996
and so we're in fact when it comes to

3066.609 --> 3071.2889999999998
tobacco and nicotine the nicotine that's

3069.19 --> 3073.539
in there is probably actually combating

3071.289 --> 3075.9990000000003
many of the carcinogenic effects of the

3073.539 --> 3078.489
smoking just like it does with in

3075.999 --> 3080.23
cannabis can't many of the properties in

3078.489 --> 3081.43
cannabis counteract their carcinogenic

3080.23 --> 3083.289
effects that's why you don't see people

3081.43 --> 3085.1499999999996
who have been smoking marijuana for

3083.289 --> 3087.2200000000003
sixty years with any type of lung cancer

3085.15 --> 3088.539
or anything like that yeah right so to

3087.22 --> 3089.799
put a book on that we

3088.539 --> 3092.1690000000003
come back to that I just want to go

3089.799 --> 3093.88
conclude our previous business which is

3092.169 --> 3095.709
essentially I don't have a personal

3093.88 --> 3097.509
problem with you Trish I have no

3095.709 --> 3099.759
personal problem with you any way shape

3097.509 --> 3102.219
or form I don't know you but I'm very

3099.759 --> 3104.759
very very good friends with Arwen very

3102.219 --> 3107.559
good friends and so when I see somebody

3104.759 --> 3110.289
conducting themselves in certain ways it

3107.559 --> 3113.679
draws my eye and when I notice a pattern

3110.289 --> 3115.679
it makes me look even closer and so when

3113.679 --> 3119.0190000000002
I see things like your actual

3115.679 --> 3120.849
manipulation bullying different tactics

3119.019 --> 3122.89
being employed it doesn't really matter

3120.849 --> 3124.839
to me what the intentions are it's

3122.89 --> 3127.0589999999997
purely the actions and the results and

3124.839 --> 3128.919
the outcomes thereof and so when I see

3127.059 --> 3131.0190000000002
that behavior it's going to get

3128.919 --> 3132.5789999999997
addressed and it's never gonna work out

3131.019 --> 3136.5989999999997
well for the person that's doing that

3132.579 --> 3144.329
stuff and so it happens again it's only

3136.599 --> 3149.079
gonna be worse next time Hevy finished

3144.329 --> 3152.039
is that it's great no that sounded just

3149.079 --> 3152.039
like a prediction

3158.09 --> 3165.36
well the L depends on our are you

3162.36 --> 3170.4
planning to keep on going exactly the

3165.36 --> 3172.65
way you have because rusta because rust

3170.4 --> 3174.36
has come in and said that I'm a bully

3172.65 --> 3176.25
and I'm making all these assumptions

3174.36 --> 3178.53
well if you're gonna make it all about

3176.25 --> 3191.13
somebody else then you're obviously not

3178.53 --> 3194.6400000000003
getting the message in supporting your

3191.13 --> 3197.01
channel and what you Andres to think

3194.64 --> 3197.85
that I'm gay lighting the both of you is

3197.01 --> 3203.28
that what you think

3197.85 --> 3205.17
Oh as I've addressed to you in the chat

3203.28 --> 3207.3900000000003
during my early bird shows when you

3205.17 --> 3211.98
showed up there think you're being very

3207.39 --> 3214.6099999999997
manipulative you seem to want to but you

3211.98 --> 3217.68
seem to want to play like a punishment

3214.61 --> 3220.1400000000003
reward kind of game in order to get me

3217.68 --> 3223.5
to behave exactly how you think I should

3220.14 --> 3225.21
behave that's what your behavior what

3223.5 --> 3226.68
the things you say that's what they're

3225.21 --> 3230.0
doing that's what they seem to be

3226.68 --> 3233.3399999999997
focused on I'm sorry

3230.0 --> 3236.73
in Rusty's perception I truly am sorry

3233.34 --> 3239.4900000000002
but there is not I can't manipulate you

3236.73 --> 3242.58
are when I'm on I'm how many thousands

3239.49 --> 3244.35
of miles wide these are manipulation

3242.58 --> 3255.21
tactics right here being employed and

3244.35 --> 3258.2999999999997
that is just denial sorry but no no

3255.21 --> 3260.2200000000003
that's not an apology that's sorry if

3258.3 --> 3263.52
you're confused about something I'm

3260.22 --> 3268.1
denying that I'm doing that's what that

3263.52 --> 3270.6
is that's not an apology we're not

3268.1 --> 3272.61
because all right so you're not gonna

3270.6 --> 3275.19
apologize right oh you're gonna be

3272.61 --> 3278.46
unapologetic well in that case what

3275.19 --> 3281.34
Rasta told you is gonna happen it's a

3278.46 --> 3284.31
prediction what what I see it was

3281.34 --> 3287.28
business your perception that on here

3284.31 --> 3289.77
bullying manipulating you I'm sorry if

3287.28 --> 3290.7000000000003
that's how you feel that was not my

3289.77 --> 3294.78
intention

3290.7 --> 3297.6899999999996
at all - man why have you ignored your

3294.78 --> 3299.4900000000002
knee why why have you been hearing

3297.69 --> 3303.4500000000003
numerous warnings and requests from

3299.49 --> 3310.41
Arwen to cease and desist what do I need

3303.45 --> 3313.5
to stop my commenting is it my

3310.41 --> 3317.52
commenting is it or I can't speak about

3313.5 --> 3320.91
the Bible and truth in God I'm not sure

3317.52 --> 3327.81
it's know you now speak here it's the a

3320.91 --> 3330.12
controlling behavior I can't believe

3327.81 --> 3333.15
that you're trying to baller this one

3330.12 --> 3335.37
out because this is just what the

3333.15 --> 3337.71
ballers do when they supposedly can't

3335.37 --> 3339.75
understand the point even though it's

3337.71 --> 3342.42
very blatantly obvious this should be

3339.75 --> 3344.85
blatantly obvious to you and now we have

3342.42 --> 3358.08
to explain from scratch again because

3344.85 --> 3361.47
you got lost in the conversation well

3358.08 --> 3364.02
that that was kind of the crown jewel of

3361.47 --> 3366.33
that yes but before that you did that

3364.02 --> 3368.73
and afterwards you've done that in other

3366.33 --> 3371.4
chats in other hangouts when I'm in the

3368.73 --> 3373.5
panel you even from the chat still try

3371.4 --> 3374.67
to manipulate me get my attention

3373.5 --> 3380.0
somehow

3374.67 --> 3380.0
guilt trip me you try to guilt trip me

3391.58 --> 3398.24
and I was probably being a Salesman and

3394.95 --> 3406.1099999999997
it wasn't good okay and I'm sorry

3398.24 --> 3409.74
that's good but yeah but if the behavior

3406.11 --> 3413.1600000000003
continues don't expect things to go any

3409.74 --> 3415.89
better than they have today right and if

3413.16 --> 3418.97
you will then I will be very happy about

3415.89 --> 3418.97
it that's all

3419.76 --> 3426.7200000000003
the great Rasta from a [ __ ] action we

3424.5 --> 3430.71
have all got together and I think we

3426.72 --> 3432.81
found some common ground I fully take on

3430.71 --> 3434.67
board that I was being a Salesman when

3432.81 --> 3438.0299999999997
it came to the Bible thing our and I am

3434.67 --> 3439.9500000000003
truly sorry I'm truly sorry about that

3438.03 --> 3442.44
you're right I should give you a super

3439.95 --> 3443.7
check and you do whatever you want to do

3442.44 --> 3445.35
that there shouldn't be any strings

3443.7 --> 3448.9399999999996
attached and that was conditional and

3445.35 --> 3454.37
that was shitty and I'm sorry about that

3448.94 --> 3462.84
but I am and restaurant I'm not a gypsy

3454.37 --> 3465.12
I'm truly not well determined but right

3462.84 --> 3467.76
the thing about gypsies is they are

3465.12 --> 3471.27
absolutely two-faced and unrepentant

3467.76 --> 3474.98
that is one of the very trademarks about

3471.27 --> 3478.98
them so we'll see but a if you say that

3474.98 --> 3480.9
that you get it then we'll see that so

3478.98 --> 3486.96
I'm curious to see yeah I will be paying

3480.9 --> 3489.2400000000002
attention me too I hope so all right so

3486.96 --> 3491.61
and I I would like to run out the show

3489.24 --> 3495.5099999999998
with that because it's 3 o'clock over

3491.61 --> 3498.1800000000003
here if that's okay with you two it's

3495.51 --> 3500.19
been a fantastic thank you very much for

3498.18 --> 3502.2
having me I really appreciate it and

3500.19 --> 3505.02
Trish I will not be trolling you in

3502.2 --> 3507.48
chats so just know it better be nice to

3505.02 --> 3509.63
Arwen and don't try your sneaky little

3507.48 --> 3514.14
tactics whatever your intentions may be

3509.63 --> 3517.8900000000003
because we're watching I'm watching you

3514.14 --> 3521.46
too it's no Rusted I personally take

3517.89 --> 3523.41
anyone or I'll come see ya guess what I

3521.46 --> 3524.73
have relationships with many people and

3523.41 --> 3526.7999999999997
you'll see me attack them if they

3524.73 --> 3528.96
deserve it and so if you try to get in

3526.8 --> 3530.9900000000002
the way you will get caught in the

3528.96 --> 3534.12
crossfire and you will be cannon fodder

3530.99 --> 3540.0299999999997
it's okay I'm a big girl I can handle a

3534.12 --> 3544.56
few scary little keyboard warriors here

3540.03 --> 3548.489
we go with the pride again there we go

3544.56 --> 3553.089
