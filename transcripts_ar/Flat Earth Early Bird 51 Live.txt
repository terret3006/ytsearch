4.16 --> 12.269
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

8.46 --> 20.6
early-bird number 51 I'm your host

12.269 --> 26.4
Arwen and today is it's pretty while

20.6 --> 33.14
gray but mild weather and yeah are you

26.4 --> 38.69
all doing was which the black gravity

33.14 --> 38.69
Macavity and Nathan

46.91 --> 54.309999999999995
though so yeah yesterday shows what was

53.21 --> 57.35
a blast

54.31 --> 61.28
it's pretty incredible I had a record

57.35 --> 64.37
amount of life viewers and record amount

61.28 --> 66.76
of first fewers I've never seen anything

64.37 --> 66.76
like it

68.44 --> 72.37
how much did I get

81.36 --> 91.01
we have 483 views until within the last

88.14 --> 96.77
19 hours yeah I was cool

91.01 --> 99.84
so I since Nathan Oakley is not

96.77 --> 106.64999999999999
scheduled to do any hangout anytime soon

99.84 --> 110.4
I will be traded basically filling the

106.65 --> 113.64
gap and allowing some level of debate

110.4 --> 115.68
here on my channel so everyone is

113.64 --> 118.58
welcome I've already put out the link in

115.68 --> 118.58000000000001
Skype

124.82 --> 127.27
was

134.36 --> 139.07000000000002
yeah I have no problem continuing the

136.84 --> 145.76
discussion we had yesterday it was

139.07 --> 149.81
pretty good interesting and weird about

145.76 --> 153.41
cinder because yeah I guess he is just

149.81 --> 158.21
fully back on the ball right now it's

153.41 --> 163.91
kind of odd because he did move away so

158.21 --> 168.38
it seemed and was getting the argument

163.91 --> 171.07999999999998
so it seemed he yeah he showed clearly

168.38 --> 174.74
that he had an understanding of some of

171.08 --> 179.12
these concepts so he was getting there

174.74 --> 181.16
but then he just dropped it forgot about

179.12 --> 185.54
it all it seems I don't know what's

181.16 --> 188.29999999999998
going on why why he actually did what he

185.54 --> 193.85
did never really had a convincing

188.3 --> 199.55
explanation from Xander so far but hey

193.85 --> 203.56
RAF and Lee time to see yeah you're also

199.55 --> 203.56
welcome on this panel if you like

213.62 --> 218.44
yeah balls already sent you the link in

216.11 --> 218.44000000000003
sky

235.03 --> 237.87
see

240.17 --> 242.73999999999998
right

244.09 --> 250.08
yeah hey wait what is this auntie's life

256.07 --> 258.09999999999997
a

260.199 --> 267.09000000000003
Strait is stealing all my traffic

263.58 --> 271.00899999999996
mm-hmm okay I guess he's doing some

267.09 --> 271.00899999999996
really interesting life footage

271.87 --> 277.0
a was I'm just gonna pause it here

275.59 --> 280.65999999999997
because it took me a while to actually

277.0 --> 282.34
find what I was looking for essentially

280.66 --> 284.02000000000004
I couldn't believe that this is why I

282.34 --> 288.54999999999995
was actually going to see because back

284.02 --> 294.03
then whilst can you hear me yes can you

288.55 --> 298.93
do me yeah good oh hey are you going

294.03 --> 302.59
good feeling better today yesterday's

298.93 --> 306.55
show was really good yeah it was I have

302.59 --> 310.84
to commend you on your hosting skills it

306.55 --> 318.96000000000004
was nice in retrospect I thought it was

310.84 --> 320.67999999999995
a little bit interruptive well I

318.96 --> 322.65999999999997
understand what you're saying but I

320.68 --> 325.75
don't think that was a big issue because

322.66 --> 329.08000000000004
you didn't do it a lot I try to hold

325.75 --> 330.55
back as much as possible and I yeah I

329.08 --> 333.7
think your worries was growing pretty

330.55 --> 335.02000000000004
fluently bytes well you're on you could

333.7 --> 337.65999999999997
see that you could see it was running

335.02 --> 339.84999999999997
quite well and you let it float yeah

337.66 --> 344.56
actual flow it's good good on your night

339.85 --> 346.6
indeed Thanks yeah I hope to repeat that

344.56 --> 348.91
I actually I actually went back and read

346.6 --> 352.27000000000004
a few comments and a lot of people were

348.91 --> 355.39000000000004
saying how good it was a lot of people

352.27 --> 358.51
were happy that you let the conversation

355.39 --> 360.37
flow and you jump you jumped in when you

358.51 --> 364.3
needed to where did you cut it everyone

360.37 --> 367.96
else I read them I think I read them on

364.3 --> 369.82
the comment stream really because I just

367.96 --> 373.62
had a lot of troll comments as far as

369.82 --> 378.04
I'm aware now there were a few good ones

373.62 --> 380.2
don't you think fondant but yeah a lot

378.04 --> 382.56
of comments so I got the feeling mostly

380.2 --> 382.56
that

386.27 --> 392.41999999999996
know where your comments your comments

388.83 --> 395.90999999999997
cants gonna sin so look lost

392.42 --> 397.53000000000003
yeah I need to arrange something

395.91 --> 400.05
yeah I got something weird going on

397.53 --> 402.86999999999995
because I basically have to live streams

400.05 --> 406.5
simultaneously streaming but that's

402.87 --> 410.55
because there is the daily stream

406.5 --> 416.0
setting thing and that's always on it's

410.55 --> 416.0
a matter of just clicking start but

421.13 --> 426.4
I was actually speaking to a few people

423.08 --> 433.64
on discord and I record interest as well

426.4 --> 437.14
he's the way you ran the show yeah she'd

433.64 --> 440.93
come on inside later a few people

437.14 --> 445.49
increase your review erase your

440.93 --> 449.71
subscribers well yeah I don't know who

445.49 --> 452.03000000000003
out there is interested really sounds

449.71 --> 454.76
well you want you'll never know unless

452.03 --> 456.65
you go and explore really with you well

454.76 --> 464.18
I'm not gonna go on discord it's not my

456.65 --> 465.79999999999995
place right but there's now if I'm

464.18 --> 468.77
career so flattered at the earlybird

465.8 --> 470.62
number 50 and number 51 running at the

468.77 --> 473.84
same time in there the same thing I

470.62 --> 475.24
can't even turn it one off this is so

473.84 --> 479.92999999999995
weird

475.24 --> 482.93
the one up joint is 51 well I got one

479.93 --> 487.85
that says 50 yeah I present my scream to

482.93 --> 492.38
show you it's very weird let's see I'm

487.85 --> 493.45000000000005
looking at number 50 yeah for me right

492.38 --> 497.84
now

493.45 --> 503.36
okay no see see

497.84 --> 510.28
yeah that is weird yeah I have no idea

503.36 --> 510.28000000000003
why but yeah we'll see if it persists

510.34 --> 514.8199999999999
afterwards you know yeah do you want

513.38 --> 517.21
since there's only you and me here do

514.82 --> 522.8900000000001
you wanna risk turning that one off or

517.21 --> 525.98
not now I can't I can't turn it off I

522.89 --> 527.96
already looked in but yeah it seems to

525.98 --> 532.82
be life going and there's no way to turn

527.96 --> 534.23
it off except if yeah you you think you

532.82 --> 536.33
might kill them both if you did that

534.23 --> 540.41
yeah I'm pretty certain I would if I if

536.33 --> 545.95
I tried oh yeah if I look at your

540.41 --> 545.9499999999999
channel it does say to live streams he

546.37 --> 551.68
sent me is for 51

555.59 --> 564.21
hmm what I could do let's try it out is

559.98 --> 566.64
go to the the 51 stream and just turn it

564.21 --> 569.99
or the 50 stream and just turn it into a

566.64 --> 572.61
51 so they will be literally identical

569.99 --> 574.44
it's like you're looping model mate it's

572.61 --> 577.83
like the sun's gone to the west and

574.44 --> 579.87
looped back what's this make it look

577.83 --> 583.6800000000001
like a joke right

579.87 --> 587.13
I appreciate it then obviously not a

583.68 --> 589.62
good one it's very hard to make good

587.13 --> 595.88
jokes with things that's complicated

589.62 --> 600.35
that's yeah nonlinear space and loops I

595.88 --> 600.35
think and it's great gellick footer

600.53 --> 607.05
let's make a few jokes are better non

604.53 --> 610.01
will on non linear space shall we

607.05 --> 610.01
looking we can do that

619.25 --> 623.99
now it's too hard you're right now I

621.98 --> 628.73
could think of one but it's not really

623.99 --> 633.41
funny it's open you're right not my

628.73 --> 635.6
funny jokes but normally it's just okay

633.41 --> 642.4699999999999
this is a bad joke but just because I'm

635.6 --> 645.649
trying to make a joke it's just like no

642.47 --> 649.639
it doesn't work well that's that's

645.649 --> 651.639
nonlinear then yeah now it no it doesn't

649.639 --> 655.149
work yes it's not really funny it

651.639 --> 655.149
doesn't really work

657.64 --> 663.85
oh yeah you could potentially make jobs

660.7 --> 666.7
with shooting super powerful lasers in

663.85 --> 668.6800000000001
your own ass by shooting them either

666.7 --> 670.47
perfectly west or east that kind of

668.68 --> 672.8499999999999
thing

670.47 --> 675.6700000000001
all right so it goes all the way around

672.85 --> 677.769
comes back and gets in yon but I'm not

675.67 --> 682.29
really around it just goes straight for

677.769 --> 684.67
not work right to the hoop so yeah

682.29 --> 687.73
there's no rounds there's no corner

684.67 --> 692.9499999999999
there's no bending of the light how do

687.73 --> 694.149
you steal your own butt with a laser no

692.95 --> 700.63
that doesn't work you're right

694.149 --> 708.04
see it's very impractical at least it's

700.63 --> 709.329
funny trying to make one up yeah no no

708.04 --> 711.3389999999999
the more I think about it the more

709.329 --> 714.91
terrible the jokes are attending to

711.339 --> 726.19
become that stuff the eilat just let's

714.91 --> 727.5699999999999
stick to the globe isn't it at least at

726.19 --> 729.7900000000001
least on the globe if you're gonna shoot

727.57 --> 731.1700000000001
yourself in your you shoot yourself in

729.79 --> 733.829
the ass with a laser you can bring

731.17 --> 738.779
refraction into the joint in sunlight

733.829 --> 742.05
hmm all right but I don't know he'll say

738.779 --> 745.449
maybe it doesn't work on the glut Abita

742.05 --> 748.449
well technically if you would presuppose

745.449 --> 750.2199999999999
the restroom refraction yeah then you

748.449 --> 754.7199999999999
could shoot yourself in the ass as well

750.22 --> 758.9200000000001
with a laser a presupposition jug

754.72 --> 762.6
yeah well the entire heliocentric model

758.92 --> 765.49
is a presuppositional joke now isn't it

762.6 --> 770.2900000000001
well yeah that's all perspective isn't

765.49 --> 774.4300000000001
it yeah it's the just right it's

770.29 --> 783.3399999999999
literally all perspective necessary

774.43 --> 787.0
the accountants for it hey dear

783.34 --> 794.98
yeah I'm trained at those type of jokes

787.0 --> 798.22
oh so have you done any you mentioned

794.98 --> 800.83
the other day that you had really good

798.22 --> 805.6600000000001
reflexes mm-hmm remember that

800.83 --> 807.64
conversation mm-hmm yeah hey what what

805.66 --> 812.5899999999999
level would you put bill of reflexes I

807.64 --> 816.13
take it you're over 35 but I guess if I

812.59 --> 823.0300000000001
may ask Peter Kenton I guess at your age

816.13 --> 826.75
being more than 35 years old yeah yeah

823.03 --> 830.05
okay so if you had to compare yourself

826.75 --> 833.85
to a younger person using your reflexes

830.05 --> 836.77
what age would you say your reflexes are

833.85 --> 838.78
well if I can only compare it to the

836.77 --> 843.0699999999999
reflexes I had when I was young

838.78 --> 846.3399999999999
yeah okay but yeah my reflexes were even

843.07 --> 849.19
faster when I was young but I didn't

846.34 --> 852.5500000000001
have them trained so they would result

849.19 --> 853.87
in very sudden [ __ ] reactions that

852.55 --> 857.41
didn't really work out

853.87 --> 860.02
but since I've trained them actively to

857.41 --> 864.01
basically plan in my head ahead to do

860.02 --> 864.43
something really quickly and then forget

864.01 --> 867.13
about it

864.43 --> 869.1099999999999
and then on some impulse act on it do it

867.13 --> 871.03
really quickly suddenly let it pop in

869.11 --> 873.04
your mind do it and then if you do that

871.03 --> 875.4399999999999
kind of thing if you train that as a

873.04 --> 879.88
mechanism you build it inside of

875.44 --> 882.1
yourself then eventually your instinct

879.88 --> 883.87
will take over and you don't have to

882.1 --> 886.75
think about it it's just a trick you

883.87 --> 889.27
learned so one of these tricks is the

886.75 --> 891.64
catching trick something drops I will

889.27 --> 893.71
catch it I will either catch it with my

891.64 --> 896.8
hand and if my hand feels then I will

893.71 --> 900.07
catch it with my foot as to prevent any

896.8 --> 902.63
type of breaking and I will you be used

900.07 --> 905.5400000000001
as a shock absorber to basically

902.63 --> 908.569
as things perfectly autumn for breaking

905.54 --> 909.92
for example moving with it - yeah an

908.569 --> 912.2299999999999
instant shock

909.92 --> 915.319
I know exactly let me it works really

912.23 --> 918.589
well I haven't broken anything in a very

915.319 --> 921.139
long time watch others people will break

918.589 --> 923.99
things Needham can't catch those things

921.139 --> 928.04
would you would you would you pit

923.99 --> 929.899
yourself against a cat for example well

928.04 --> 933.199
cat don't really prevent things from

929.899 --> 936.019
breaking now do they the opposite knee

933.199 --> 938.81
rather now they actually push things off

936.019 --> 940.97
to make them break exactly because it

938.81 --> 942.68
gets them attention that's what he is

940.97 --> 943.94
not flat because if it was the cats

942.68 --> 946.43
would have pushed everything off for now

943.94 --> 959.149
but a boom that's my joke hey I made a

946.43 --> 965.81
joke but I have heard that my Jacob up

959.149 --> 968.24
with logic logic make the best jokes but

965.81 --> 970.189
I was wondering I was wondering what the

968.24 --> 974.99
chances are getting a demonstration of

970.189 --> 978.259
your pre OS your reflexes hey you know

974.99 --> 980.29
you know meet me personally then you do

978.259 --> 984.17
it on camera Utley get to see it because

980.29 --> 986.93
yeah things happen all the time because

984.17 --> 990.259
I didn't I am still kind of hyperactive

986.93 --> 993.949
so especially in social conversations I

990.259 --> 997.6990000000001
get more active and I will at times

993.949 --> 1000.49
accidentally bump things off over if

997.699 --> 1002.68
it's not the environment I'm used to

1000.49 --> 1004.9300000000001
doing that for example this environment

1002.68 --> 1009.43
here is super control because I have

1004.93 --> 1012.0089999999999
everything positioned in a in a specific

1009.43 --> 1014.7399999999999
fashion that I know where everything is

1012.009 --> 1018.519
and that I can basically close my eyes

1014.74 --> 1021.069
and pretty much know everything where it

1018.519 --> 1021.67
is so nothing is going to be thrown over

1021.069 --> 1024.52
or

1021.67 --> 1028.569
over here but if it's a place I don't

1024.52 --> 1031.0
know that it might happen so I will bump

1028.569 --> 1034.209
things over in heavy conversations and

1031.0 --> 1036.03
then immediately catch it so after

1034.209 --> 1039.189
didn't you'd have to meet me in person

1036.03 --> 1040.059
to see it okay I'd be a bit scared if I

1039.189 --> 1043.559
met you in person

1040.059 --> 1052.12
oh really I'm not a big guy you know

1043.559 --> 1055.8999999999999
neither am i no have you ever have you

1052.12 --> 1057.6399999999999
ever tried that that reflux thing it's

1055.9 --> 1060.73
kind of what the reflux thing where you

1057.64 --> 1062.3200000000002
put a coin okay let me try and explain

1060.73 --> 1065.2
this do it properly so you it makes

1062.32 --> 1066.79
sense you bend your hand back to your

1065.2 --> 1070.809
right hand back to your right shoulder

1066.79 --> 1076.51
and then you have your the top of your

1070.809 --> 1081.07
elbow kind of exposed upwards you follow

1076.51 --> 1082.72
me and then you put a few coins yeah but

1081.07 --> 1085.4189999999999
that's it but turn turn your wrist

1082.72 --> 1092.13
around so your wrist is pointing towards

1085.419 --> 1092.13
the ceiling no no turn your wrist around

1092.61 --> 1096.9399999999998
I've got a delight when I'm speaking to

1095.679 --> 1097.5400000000002
you and when I'm watching you I've got a

1096.94 --> 1101.44
delight

1097.54 --> 1103.24
okay so so if you put coins on your

1101.44 --> 1106.74
elbow yeah that's it if you put coins on

1103.24 --> 1109.39
your elbow you've got a lot of cash Tim

1106.74 --> 1112.69
yeah all right

1109.39 --> 1115.0590000000002
coins on your elbow and then like that

1112.69 --> 1119.549
yeah it all depends on the nature of

1115.059 --> 1123.8799999999999
your sleeve really take your jumper on

1119.549 --> 1127.15
yeah put a t-shirt on but have you got

1123.88 --> 1129.929
to change it on yeah so you could take

1127.15 --> 1129.929
your jumper up and do it

1130.14 --> 1134.89
[Music]

1132.09 --> 1138.8799999999999
well I don't know if I'd be good at that

1134.89 --> 1141.91
specific trick because I'd have to

1138.88 --> 1145.5700000000002
basically the trick is with that trick

1141.91 --> 1147.64
is it's paid well the problem is is that

1145.57 --> 1149.4099999999999
the more speed you make the more force

1147.64 --> 1151.69
you exert on the coin

1149.41 --> 1154.75
so that's right it's a very delicate

1151.69 --> 1156.88
balance you can't just do that at first

1154.75 --> 1160.57
correct you have to have the right feel

1156.88 --> 1163.23
2 for 2 controller implemented I don't

1160.57 --> 1166.81
know that kind of thing like instantly

1163.23 --> 1169.38
it's more like I can make sure that my

1166.81 --> 1173.4099999999999
hand or foot are at the right

1169.38 --> 1175.0900000000001
coordinates within well the view above 2

1173.41 --> 1179.0800000000002
meter square

1175.09 --> 1181.6599999999999
yeah of 2 meter basically instant so

1179.08 --> 1184.72
that but that's it that's that's what

1181.66 --> 1186.3700000000001
this sort of motion does so you've got

1184.72 --> 1189.8500000000001
to coordinate your hand to meet the

1186.37 --> 1197.5
coins at a specific point in time and

1189.85 --> 1202.2099999999998
space in order to catch those the trick

1197.5 --> 1205.21
is to have say three groups of 5 coins

1202.21 --> 1207.73
on your bow and try and catch their way

1205.21 --> 1211.17
no way I'm not going to go that far I'll

1207.73 --> 1211.17
start with God I start with a couple

1216.35 --> 1231.08
I've got a I got a video July here yeah

1220.049 --> 1231.08
that's it yeah you can stand up I could

1231.65 --> 1236.27
it's just a practice run it's fine

1239.09 --> 1246.48
see I just it's the hardest thing is to

1243.69 --> 1249.0900000000001
get it in here because if it's slightly

1246.48 --> 1253.59
off you'll just throw it away just like

1249.09 --> 1260.309
what happens see you can't you can't

1253.59 --> 1260.82
push your elbow up I practice it you

1260.309 --> 1264.48
never know

1260.82 --> 1265.8899999999999
by the way it's better if you're facing

1264.48 --> 1267.8700000000001
the camera because we can get a better

1265.89 --> 1270.8400000000001
view do what you gave us then was an

1267.87 --> 1273.4799999999998
orthographic view yeah I'm not gonna

1270.84 --> 1282.9289999999999
throw it towards my ears computers oh

1273.48 --> 1290.16
yeah okay oh yeah there you go right cat

1282.929 --> 1292.44
man well third times that hard

1290.16 --> 1295.5
I think beauty you got it you got the

1292.44 --> 1299.88
idea and now the trick the trick is to

1295.5 --> 1302.13
increase the amount of coins as you as

1299.88 --> 1306.8300000000002
you go now I don't have any more coins

1302.13 --> 1306.8300000000002
and pour if you well maybe people can

1307.4 --> 1320.46
people donate to are one please yeah

1316.29 --> 1325.29
yeah it took a little focus around two

1320.46 --> 1327.3600000000001
seconds it's it requires a planned

1325.29 --> 1330.54
instant action kind of like how I

1327.36 --> 1338.4599999999998
trained catching things I don't want to

1330.54 --> 1343.5
brag but I got up to 15 coins there's a

1338.46 --> 1346.17
limit there's a limitation Hance well ii

1343.5 --> 1350.04
became there's a lot of coins big hands

1346.17 --> 1358.91
go hand in hand with other things so no

1350.04 --> 1365.34
I don't have begins you've got it I do

1358.91 --> 1368.48
oh now you're bragging yep with

1365.34 --> 1368.48
everything that comes with that

1379.96 --> 1387.009
so you don't I think you practice in a

1384.309 --> 1389.019
few yeah if you practice that in if you

1387.009 --> 1391.619
know in in a few nights maybe we can see

1389.019 --> 1391.619
you beat my record

1396.419 --> 1402.789
is hard to resist a physical challenge

1399.369 --> 1410.74
like that especially reflux bass since

1402.789 --> 1414.179
I'm good at it that's always fun been

1410.74 --> 1417.119
you annual show me thanks

1414.179 --> 1419.44
is that all we got just you and me I

1417.119 --> 1422.529
expected more but I think that

1419.44 --> 1424.1490000000001
everybody's hanging out at Randy's right

1422.529 --> 1426.58
now oh really

1424.149 --> 1428.83
yeah he started the stream and 45

1426.58 --> 1432.549
minutes ago it's kind of that's a bit

1428.83 --> 1436.029
rude unusual yeah it's a live video

1432.549 --> 1437.799
stream oh I think he just might've this

1436.029 --> 1442.539
does he know that you do this yeah

1437.799 --> 1444.399
following on from that this time does he

1442.539 --> 1449.74
know that you go live at this time yeah

1444.399 --> 1451.1789999999999
yeah he wasn't sure but personally I

1449.74 --> 1453.789
think that's a bit rude him doing that

1451.179 --> 1459.159
taking your views why would he go alive

1453.789 --> 1462.9089999999999
when you go by video so that's a one-off

1459.159 --> 1464.7990000000002
special occasion thing okay okay

1462.909 --> 1468.3990000000001
probably because he's gonna be busy with

1464.799 --> 1471.399
family and stuff after this Hey okay

2227.65 --> 2234.19
not just a [ __ ] button I'm not just a

2231.85 --> 2239.1
meat and then my camera for a minute

2234.19 --> 2242.26
when I go in there yeah I gotta tell my

2239.1 --> 2244.69
I'll keep chatting with you the female

2242.26 --> 2249.46
gets better we take him around okay

2244.69 --> 2256.39
somebody who is about to join us I am in

2249.46 --> 2259.18
a curve asked for a link so he may be

2256.39 --> 2261.0099999999998
joining any moments what do you got

2259.18 --> 2264.37
but you got half of the people over

2261.01 --> 2270.6400000000003
there for the people over there in Iran

2264.37 --> 2275.44
t yeah but is he is doing he is showing

2270.64 --> 2277.66
some really good footage so you saw but

2275.44 --> 2279.37
they last video you uploaded right with

2277.66 --> 2283.39
a little reflection underneath a piece

2279.37 --> 2285.5699999999997
of land and they both went by was really

2283.39 --> 2285.5699999999997
cool

2288.02 --> 2293.33
okay so your button is still out there

2298.79 --> 2302.95
yeah I'm doing a bunch of like little

2300.71 --> 2305.48
blink test just for my own amusement

2302.95 --> 2307.91
having a load of loaded anything in

2305.48 --> 2310.31
youtube I mean all my videos are there

2307.91 --> 2312.52
with different distances different

2310.31 --> 2315.08
heights if anybody want to compare

2312.52 --> 2316.94
observations all the coordinates are

2315.08 --> 2319.1
there I'm just doing it by my own

2316.94 --> 2322.19
amusement to see what difference it

2319.1 --> 2325.1
makes but imma glow uploading just the

2322.19 --> 2327.05
original raw videos on my channel and

2325.1 --> 2329.81
the last one I uploaded was like 6

2327.05 --> 2332.15
minutes and it was really cool because

2329.81 --> 2334.94
it's the very shallow low piece of land

2332.15 --> 2337.4
growing across and the boat was going

2334.94 --> 2339.32
behind it but you can see the reflection

2337.4 --> 2342.02
of the boat underneath a piece of land

2339.32 --> 2343.4900000000002
so it's the water it's like an empty

2342.02 --> 2345.47
space because you see the little piece

2343.49 --> 2347.72
of land hovering because of the inferior

2345.47 --> 2349.3689999999997
Mirage and then the boat going behind

2347.72 --> 2351.2799999999997
you can see the reflection or they need

2349.369 --> 2354.29
the piece of land like if it's a

2351.28 --> 2357.38
hovering little something it's really

2354.29 --> 2360.35
weird to look it and then in the comment

2357.38 --> 2362.51
section some guy ah does not land what

2360.35 --> 2364.25
you're looking at that is water that is

2362.51 --> 2367.73
whatever he tried to give me an estimate

2364.25 --> 2369.5
just a year so you have no idea what I

2367.73 --> 2371.78
was looking at you have no idea what I

2369.5 --> 2373.04
was so stop bullshitting excuses you

2371.78 --> 2375.8300000000004
know because they don't they don't have

2373.04 --> 2378.95
an explanation it's not necessarily a

2375.83 --> 2381.0499999999997
flood proof or nothing like that but he

2378.95 --> 2383.7799999999997
said really cool optical effects with

2381.05 --> 2391.94
the atmosphere that that goes down you

2383.78 --> 2394.9700000000003
know I'm back by the way I gotta see my

2391.94 --> 2396.59
whiskey I'm happy I gotta get me some of

2394.97 --> 2399.9199999999996
that fuzz ready I'm gonna build myself a

2396.59 --> 2402.98
minute alright yeah it did some great

2399.92 --> 2407.9300000000003
work there Jose I've been really

2402.98 --> 2411.92
enjoying your amazing horizon-- mirages

2407.93 --> 2414.5
own footage is the Train one still one

2411.92 --> 2418.9700000000003
of the most remarkable ones but also the

2414.5 --> 2422.06
boat basically slowly diagonally moving

2418.97 --> 2423.79
into the Mirage ings own on-camera life

2422.06 --> 2429.54
that was also very

2423.79 --> 2429.54
specialist it's very cool yes thank you

2431.78 --> 2434.53
so

2441.62 --> 2447.17
fine so you're still gonna be hmm sorry

2445.16 --> 2448.73
I was gonna ask you for house I still

2447.17 --> 2451.9700000000003
with us or is he just made it

2448.73 --> 2454.76
he's just mutism you said he was gonna

2451.97 --> 2455.48
yeah yeah I gotta be making sounds of

2454.76 --> 2457.1600000000003
like quitting

2455.48 --> 2458.9900000000002
kitchen kitchen sounds I don't want to

2457.16 --> 2462.8599999999997
disturb you but what you have you cut

2458.99 --> 2465.3799999999997
breakfast right I got some sliced bread

2462.86 --> 2467.7200000000003
cheaper bread some ham and cheese little

2465.38 --> 2476.33
little sandwiches something to snack on

2467.72 --> 2478.7599999999998
that's what I had for breakfast abundant

2476.33 --> 2484.25
supply of hands or maybe a strawberry

2478.76 --> 2490.46
jelly you call it jelly as well a jam

2484.25 --> 2492.41
it's technically Jim Jim enormous yeah

2490.46 --> 2495.71
it has actual pieces of fruit in it

2492.41 --> 2499.43
jelly is just the extract being

2495.71 --> 2499.91
jellified so we tweak jellies different

2499.43 --> 2505.0099999999998
for us

2499.91 --> 2506.99
mm-hmm when we say jam we we can refer

2505.01 --> 2511.76
to the spread that doesn't have the food

2506.99 --> 2513.4399999999996
fruity bits in it and and I think

2511.76 --> 2516.38
there's another one called the concert

2513.44 --> 2519.98
which might have the 30 bits in it but

2516.38 --> 2522.8900000000003
we generally call them both jam but what

2519.98 --> 2530.54
we call jelly is that wobbly stuff you

2522.89 --> 2533.93
have without you know I could say all

2530.54 --> 2537.98
right no jelly we call it jelly really

2533.93 --> 2539.21
is that an Australian thing yeah I don't

2537.98 --> 2543.14
know if it's English I don't know it is

2539.21 --> 2546.77
they call it jello I think hmm or

2543.14 --> 2550.52
pudding I'm not sure we should ask

2546.77 --> 2555.35
Nathan wait me to ask an Englishman

2550.52 --> 2559.16
righty-o anyone else from England yeah

2555.35 --> 2562.5499999999997
anyone for me but yet I wouldn't be

2559.16 --> 2568.3999999999996
surprised that Australia has many slight

2562.55 --> 2571.25
changes to the approach in yeah in their

2568.4 --> 2572.9900000000002
approach maybe even in the wrong

2571.25 --> 2574.05
language it happens as wells like

2572.99 --> 2576.7799999999997
different parts

2574.05 --> 2579.78
regions in the small country of the

2576.78 --> 2583.01
Netherlands they just have slightly

2579.78 --> 2586.44
different Dutch language so they just

2583.01 --> 2589.8300000000004
grabbed parts of language from another

2586.44 --> 2592.71
root from another yeah from another

2589.83 --> 2597.48
language root it's really it's really

2592.71 --> 2601.64
funny how that works just changed yeah

2597.48 --> 2610.61
from where you're taking the words at

2601.64 --> 2610.6099999999997
etymology yeah okay anyway

2611.88 --> 2615.9
belongs here I guess if you get more

2614.37 --> 2617.04
gifts on you might run a bit longer when

2615.9 --> 2620.2200000000003
asked how long you're gonna run for

2617.04 --> 2622.17
today well it does really depend on if

2620.22 --> 2625.3199999999997
there's gonna be some kind of debate

2622.17 --> 2628.89
going because otherwise I'm gonna run at

2625.32 --> 2635.61
least 15 more minutes but yeah yeah yeah

2628.89 --> 2638.46
I'm up to run up to potentially two

2635.61 --> 2640.53
hours beyond that if it's worth it and

2638.46 --> 2642.78
if we're not gonna have all these pauses

2640.53 --> 2646.5600000000004
and not really knowing what to say that

2642.78 --> 2649.11
has to be a kind of a debate - yeah -

2646.56 --> 2651.27
feel a long session like that

2649.11 --> 2657.06
like yesterday mm-hmm yeah you're right

2651.27 --> 2660.72
we need some more people to join okay so

2657.06 --> 2663.75
and so the moon landings were faked I

2660.72 --> 2667.29
don't think we ever never ever been

2663.75 --> 2669.47
higher than a couple hundred miles up

2667.29 --> 2672.63
now I'm not talking about the vacuum

2669.47 --> 2674.25
without a series so we have a very short

2672.63 --> 2677.21
and a vacuum without a container but I

2674.25 --> 2679.65
don't think we have never ever been in

2677.21 --> 2681.81
further than a couple hundred miles on

2679.65 --> 2684.23
all unless you believe we have been

2681.81 --> 2686.91
higher than I talked 100 miles and why

2684.23 --> 2688.25
well first you seriously believe that or

2686.91 --> 2691.14
you just trying to bite me

2688.25 --> 2693.21
no no I yeah I believe we have

2691.14 --> 2699.24
we haven't been higher than maybe 200

2693.21 --> 2701.37
miles I say tops do you believe in God I

2699.24 --> 2704.16
know it's a bit of pushing the point

2701.37 --> 2705.72
question but yeah it's a greater I don't

2704.16 --> 2710.8199999999997
yeah no need to us are we talking about

2705.72 --> 2712.56
being higher like physically hmm what

2710.82 --> 2715.23
about the images we have from

2712.56 --> 2716.64
high-altitude balloons very explain

2715.23 --> 2718.56
those yeah that's a couple hundred

2716.64 --> 2721.41
thousand feet maybe a hundred thousand

2718.56 --> 2723.48
feet tops I'm talking about 200 miles

2721.41 --> 2727.17
you know miles this is high it's pretty

2723.48 --> 2730.95
high so I'm on demise but yeah no but

2727.17 --> 2733.2200000000003
you're talking about a seal system with

2730.95 --> 2733.22
a lid

2734.22 --> 2739.2
when you know not necessarily what I'm

2737.07 --> 2741.0
talking about it means something about

2739.2 --> 2742.6499999999996
in China what does that mean ya know

2741.0 --> 2745.89
that that's what I say I don't want to

2742.65 --> 2747.63
go into the subject on how can we have a

2745.89 --> 2748.95
back in without a container and all that

2747.63 --> 2751.05
subject I don't I don't want to go into

2748.95 --> 2753.0
the subject I'm talking about with the

2751.05 --> 2755.6400000000003
technology we have now I don't know if

2753.0 --> 2757.77
there's a barrier if there's a freaking

2755.64 --> 2759.69
dome or not but I don't think we have

2757.77 --> 2762.0
been more than a couple hundred mice

2759.69 --> 2764.57
it's just my thought because I haven't

2762.0 --> 2767.93
seen evidence of something high enough

2764.57 --> 2771.9500000000003
higher enough unless all the or less

2767.93 --> 2775.6499999999996
somebody believe all the fakery you know

2771.95 --> 2778.5899999999997
photographic evidence we have like like

2775.65 --> 2780.21
from the moon missions you say or from

2778.59 --> 2782.4300000000003
many different sources

2780.21 --> 2784.35
oh they order recording for satellites

2782.43 --> 2786.5699999999997
like the Himawari and all that good

2784.35 --> 2790.41
stuff you mean yeah you can put quotes

2786.57 --> 2793.65
around it that's wrong so when we talk

2790.41 --> 2797.25
about actual visual evidence wouldn't it

2793.65 --> 2803.37
be better to use sources that we can

2797.25 --> 2805.77
confirm almost like every time you're

2803.37 --> 2807.42
gonna resort to satellites yeah that's

2805.77 --> 2811.17
obvious

2807.42 --> 2813.0
um how are you gonna confirm that yeah

2811.17 --> 2815.73
are you saying you want your own

2813.0 --> 2816.99
personal confirmation or what do you

2815.73 --> 2820.29
mean yeah that's gonna be a tough one

2816.99 --> 2822.7099999999996
yeah that's a physical confirmation from

2820.29 --> 2826.65
reliable sources

2822.71 --> 2828.0
yeah I believe you've got that re the

2826.65 --> 2830.94
only source that we got in the space

2828.0 --> 2835.7
agencies I mean this fraud going on

2830.94 --> 2838.44
there why are they unreliable why

2835.7 --> 2844.5499999999997
frickin fix moon landing there in the

2838.44 --> 2847.8
lake a great many times and so yeah

2844.55 --> 2849.57
serious if it's like the world already

2847.8 --> 2851.2200000000003
grabbed of this moment because of

2849.57 --> 2856.73
something I wanted to address for a

2851.22 --> 2860.1899999999996
while but even on freakin Alex Jones

2856.73 --> 2862.47
they let people on that just have their

2860.19 --> 2866.31
extensive talk about how the moon

2862.47 --> 2867.0499999999997
landings were faked okay Alex himself

2866.31 --> 2870.71
persons

2867.05 --> 2873.23
no I do believe but it's even part of

2870.71 --> 2878.11
the narrative right now that that's

2873.23 --> 2881.45
faith so you think that's his narrative

2878.11 --> 2885.38
media narrative it's becoming on the

2881.45 --> 2891.5
forefront it's it's getting attention in

2885.38 --> 2894.02
media what media do you watch well I

2891.5 --> 2897.08
watch the Alex Jones Show

2894.02 --> 2899.36
i watch Russia Today I watch a lot of

2897.08 --> 2903.65
chats i watch a lot of alternative news

2899.36 --> 2906.19
sites and their videos and sources so oh

2903.65 --> 2910.07
yeah I look all over the place and I

2906.19 --> 2913.07
keep track of what comes up in what

2910.07 --> 2915.26
level every few months they talk about

2913.07 --> 2917.56
the moon landings every month in TV they

2915.26 --> 2921.11
talk about it well it's being more

2917.56 --> 2923.66
affronted that it was fake from what you

2921.11 --> 2925.82
can see perspectives mostly like yeah

2923.66 --> 2927.35
they couldn't really do it at that time

2925.82 --> 2929.6600000000003
but they had to fake it blah blah blah

2927.35 --> 2931.94
and it might be done and some people are

2929.66 --> 2933.23
saying even though on the election no

2931.94 --> 2935.2000000000003
it's not possible

2933.23 --> 2937.82
nothing but what are you saying why

2935.2 --> 2940.22
because it's not possible like they're

2937.82 --> 2943.13
kind of with them saying yeah it is kind

2940.22 --> 2945.68
of like an illusion but we're not gonna

2943.13 --> 2948.11
say it is we're just gonna not talk

2945.68 --> 2952.52
about it anymore and then reverting back

2948.11 --> 2956.09
to omars mission that is so what do you

2952.52 --> 2958.97
consider those sites reliable but it's

2956.09 --> 2961.55
everywhere it's all over the place is

2958.97 --> 2964.1299999999997
not about reliability it is about the

2961.55 --> 2967.46
insert of the narrative that is coming

2964.13 --> 2971.09
to the forefront there it's no longer

2967.46 --> 2973.55
some conspiracy theorists rumor in the

2971.09 --> 2976.13
background there's actual news writers

2973.55 --> 2978.59
even in the higher if they do not the

2976.13 --> 2981.65
CNN kind of [ __ ] it's now a conspiracy

2978.59 --> 2983.27
it's being made into articles that is

2981.65 --> 2986.63
appearing in newspapers that is

2983.27 --> 2989.36
appearing in even state-sponsored

2986.63 --> 2991.4900000000002
television programs okay

2989.36 --> 2994.55
I'm see I see your point was because

2991.49 --> 2996.8599999999997
what is reliable besides the space

2994.55 --> 3000.4300000000003
agencies with which are the only ones to

2996.86 --> 3002.799
send her something higher

3000.43 --> 3004.39
so at the I know that's what I'm asking

3002.799 --> 3006.099
myself your question it's an interesting

3004.39 --> 3009.0989999999997
question because I don't have an answer

3006.099 --> 3010.569
for that who is who can I rely on for

3009.099 --> 3014.23
that information because the only people

3010.569 --> 3016.569
that can stand higher is especially I

3014.23 --> 3023.65
guess in some ways it comes down to him

3016.569 --> 3027.279
how much how do I say this thank you for

3023.65 --> 3030.73
joining it's a case you know it's a case

3027.279 --> 3037.029
of you know how much do you put in the

3030.73 --> 3040.599
human spirit and the human have been do

3037.029 --> 3043.839
you honestly believe that humans are out

3040.599 --> 3048.089
for evil at the high levels is this

3043.839 --> 3049.359
world hello I've got a question for you

3048.089 --> 3055.8089999999997
okay

3049.359 --> 3056.319
there's some scared this mr. Flacco have

3055.809 --> 3059.4100000000003
we met

3056.319 --> 3062.02
no other mixer how do you do I'm alright

3059.41 --> 3067.299
how are you yeah good Mike good good um

3062.02 --> 3070.5389999999998
moon landings ISS transits then we

3067.299 --> 3075.7
filmed one of them you haven't they

3070.539 --> 3077.17
haven't right have you is they man's

3075.7 --> 3079.0589999999997
greatest achievement going to the moon

3077.17 --> 3082.15
they don't film the only proof they

3079.059 --> 3084.01
could have of them going there what do

3082.15 --> 3087.309
you mean the actual journey there and

3084.01 --> 3087.9900000000002
the journey back come back in the

3087.309 --> 3091.3590000000004
sixties

3087.99 --> 3094.6189999999997
whenever I assess transits where are

3091.359 --> 3098.38
they are you talking about from from

3094.619 --> 3101.71
launch from destination to the moon to

3098.38 --> 3104.77
the ISS Ramadan where's one yeah from

3101.71 --> 3109.359
launch where's one video one unedited

3104.77 --> 3113.47
video yeah oh I don't know yeah that's

3109.359 --> 3116.2889999999998
right away like how did the ISS actually

3113.47 --> 3121.0589999999997
manifest because as far as I know there

3116.289 --> 3126.25
was talk about yeah we did not actually

3121.059 --> 3128.2200000000003
see any assembly so yeah only later

3126.25 --> 3131.88
parts they added

3128.22 --> 3134.64
or something once or twice but you

3131.88 --> 3136.83
didn't actually see I have a vague

3134.64 --> 3139.65
recollection recollection of him sending

3136.83 --> 3142.5
the stuff up at the start we were told

3139.65 --> 3146.07
about it we were looking whole but you

3142.5 --> 3148.89
did Italy see it no I wasn't there a lot

3146.07 --> 3150.9900000000002
physically in the same place no but

3148.89 --> 3154.47
there was no it wasn't being filmed it

3150.99 --> 3157.02
was just being shared verbally was being

3154.47 --> 3159.8999999999996
here on his news but there was no fuzzy

3157.02 --> 3162.3
footage so a lot of attention to this

3159.9 --> 3165.6600000000003
stuff because I was absolutely obsessed

3162.3 --> 3168.42
over it at the time so when people on

3165.66 --> 3171.1189999999997
earth just your average Joe with a

3168.42 --> 3174.33
pretty decent telescoping camera when

3171.119 --> 3176.13
window film transits the biases transits

3174.33 --> 3176.7
across the moon etc what are they

3176.13 --> 3179.46
looking at

3176.7 --> 3182.25
I mean trips to tripping astronauts to

3179.46 --> 3183.869
and from the ISS so yeah yeah I know I

3182.25 --> 3187.26
understand you I understand your

3183.869 --> 3189.42
question asking for unedited video and I

3187.26 --> 3191.55
said I don't know where there is any I

3189.42 --> 3192.78
haven't but you're doing would help

3191.55 --> 3195.54
prove it wouldn't it you'd do it

3192.78 --> 3199.1400000000003
wouldn't to prove it to who people who

3195.54 --> 3202.17
deny it well what's the percentage of

3199.14 --> 3204.089
people that denied well people who look

3202.17 --> 3206.04
into it I guess and then realize it so

3204.089 --> 3208.32
the amount of people that deny it

3206.04 --> 3212.5099999999998
compared to the people that don't deny

3208.32 --> 3215.04
it just more but I mean it is wrong I

3212.51 --> 3216.8100000000004
don't know but I'm talking about the

3215.04 --> 3219.839
effort just to appease a small group of

3216.81 --> 3222.869
people the effort and costs just to a

3219.839 --> 3226.79
piece like a biochemist

3222.869 --> 3226.79
I guess the cost might be much right

3227.15 --> 3232.859
they'll probably have to guard the

3229.109 --> 3236.0989999999997
camera oh well why would they what did I

3232.859 --> 3239.79
have to well that's the one way to prove

3236.099 --> 3241.65
they've been there and back yeah if they

3239.79 --> 3242.88
did that would you call CGI or would you

3241.65 --> 3244.98
would you take it and become a

3242.88 --> 3247.17
collaborator I'd like the video to judge

3244.98 --> 3249.21
for myself but there isn't one right

3247.17 --> 3250.8
right so there's a there's no point

3249.21 --> 3252.9
doing it because this probably a good

3250.8 --> 3254.94
chance you might change you want to

3252.9 --> 3256.4100000000003
change no that's that's about argument I

3254.94 --> 3258.0
could change but I'd need to see the

3256.41 --> 3260.58
video and then judge for myself what

3258.0 --> 3261.6
you're making messenger for me yeah well

3260.58 --> 3263.67
I don't know you say

3261.6 --> 3265.47
I was making an assumption well okay

3263.67 --> 3267.78
well it's a genuine question and I think

3265.47 --> 3271.64
if I had that video it'd be more likely

3267.78 --> 3275.73
that I go okay this might be real okay

3271.64 --> 3278.1299999999997
they're the Assembly of the ISS maybe

3275.73 --> 3281.64
should ask the heart it but the official

3278.13 --> 3283.11
thing I feel they will well if you're

3281.64 --> 3283.7999999999997
not off you got together and asked for

3283.11 --> 3286.56
it you reckon

3283.8 --> 3288.63
a voice might be heard it should already

3286.56 --> 3290.46
be done let's be honest all these trips

3288.63 --> 3292.35
to and from the ISS all these trips to

3290.46 --> 3293.2200000000003
the moon and battery not one of them

3292.35 --> 3296.7
come on

3293.22 --> 3299.0099999999998
I did actually see a space shuttle from

3296.7 --> 3304.0499999999997
launched into space but I didn't see it

3299.01 --> 3306.75
dock to anything yeah well it kind of

3304.05 --> 3309.7200000000003
shows that well I know what I see you

3306.75 --> 3312.81
see it go up in the air then go around

3309.72 --> 3317.31
the curve into orbit and out of sight

3312.81 --> 3318.66
over the horizon is what you see well

3317.31 --> 3321.5099999999998
that's what you always tell you when

3318.66 --> 3325.17
they launch things funny it was acquired

3321.51 --> 3329.13
that's what you expect to see all right

3325.17 --> 3332.67
but you don't if you were in the

3329.13 --> 3337.01
position right where you would be

3332.67 --> 3340.11
directly under where it would be

3337.01 --> 3343.8300000000004
entering the atmosphere of the outer

3340.11 --> 3346.29
atmosphere deorbit then you would see

3343.83 --> 3349.92
potentially be able to see it docking

3346.29 --> 3352.65
there somewhere like not from the launch

3349.92 --> 3354.6
site but from where they are towards you

3352.65 --> 3357.4500000000003
should be able to see it but what's

3354.6 --> 3359.54
never been recorded either every people

3357.45 --> 3362.79
there's been one the rumors and

3359.54 --> 3367.44
recordings of things crashing down into

3362.79 --> 3370.95
the ocean again no hmm so when people on

3367.44 --> 3372.3
earth film the is it biases transiting

3370.95 --> 3375.18
the moon for example what are they

3372.3 --> 3377.9100000000003
filming I have no idea but I'd like to

3375.18 --> 3381.39
see something actually from Earth they

3377.91 --> 3384.7799999999997
filmed something docking the ISS more

3381.39 --> 3389.0699999999997
than just a light snowflake so if you

3384.78 --> 3390.3300000000004
have if you have no idea is a 50/50

3389.07 --> 3394.67
chance that it could be what they're

3390.33 --> 3396.02
saying no no not because

3394.67 --> 3398.83
there is a site and a lot of

3396.02 --> 3402.08
presumptions of what that supposedly is

3398.83 --> 3405.11
it is a shaped light in the sky it is a

3402.08 --> 3408.23
shape that does it transit and is

3405.11 --> 3410.9
predictable by whoever predicted and you

3408.23 --> 3413.69
can track it and you can see it but what

3410.9 --> 3415.85
is it exactly is it man-made is there

3413.69 --> 3417.44
people in it not necessarily those

3415.85 --> 3419.5699999999997
questions are the ones that I don't know

3417.44 --> 3421.34
there is smoking out there but I don't

3419.57 --> 3424.04
even know if it's even things to go you

3421.34 --> 3425.69
know yeah yes there's a 50/50 chance

3424.04 --> 3429.65
that I could be right it's just that you

3425.69 --> 3433.58
don't know yeah I can say that again

3429.65 --> 3435.23
yeah okay no I'm on the other 50% I'm on

3433.58 --> 3437.93
the other people t % to you you see

3435.23 --> 3439.85
that's the difference that's fine but I

3437.93 --> 3441.71
just wonder why you don't question why

3439.85 --> 3448.06
there's no none of this footage that I'm

3441.71 --> 3453.26
asking for I haven't had reason to okay

3448.06 --> 3456.07
there's enough evidence to to support it

3453.26 --> 3457.25
to ask for that particularly evidence

3456.07 --> 3458.9900000000002
okay

3457.25 --> 3460.97
their evidence that's that I feel that

3458.99 --> 3463.25
supports that you don't agree with so

3460.97 --> 3465.3799999999997
you have to ask for that if it has I

3463.25 --> 3467.27
don't agree with it I just I just think

3465.38 --> 3469.7000000000003
that don't they don't agree with all the

3467.27 --> 3471.95
evidence this no you don't agree with

3469.7 --> 3476.68
all the evidence we have that man has

3471.95 --> 3476.68
been into space more than 250 kilometers

3477.22 --> 3482.39
yeah you've just said told me that yeah

3480.77 --> 3484.13
I agree I don't I don't remove the

3482.39 --> 3490.1
evidence I've always I believe they're

3484.13 --> 3492.77
gone yeah so how many people do they say

3490.1 --> 3493.31
have been to space i when sating on

3492.77 --> 3497.9
camera

3493.31 --> 3500.2999999999997
I saw the Darwin is it young Rob Lee I'm

3497.9 --> 3503.27
probably wrong I heard 52 astronauts

3500.3 --> 3505.03
relating to space 52 that's what I heard

3503.27 --> 3509.33
I could be wrong right man I heard about

3505.03 --> 3511.61
400 people have left orbit Earth orbit

3509.33 --> 3515.48
that's what I heard around that

3511.61 --> 3519.77
neighborhood 400 people it's around 530

3515.48 --> 3522.29
from my last research study but yeah

3519.77 --> 3524.99
depends wait this is what they call

3522.29 --> 3528.25
spikes there's been into space from many

3524.99 --> 3528.25
different countries I think it was

3529.579 --> 3536.19
I've got a trying to remember now is 11

3532.41 --> 3538.229
or 15 countries something like that lots

3536.19 --> 3544.44
of money people will say anything was

3538.229 --> 3550.979
you really I would like the cigarette

3544.44 --> 3552.18
companies yeah yeah well the

3550.979 --> 3553.68
government's force it that's a

3552.18 --> 3555.029
government initiative to reduce the

3553.68 --> 3557.5789999999997
amount of people going into a hospital

3555.029 --> 3559.38
and saving their money you know right

3557.579 --> 3562.289
when they could have put more text on

3559.38 --> 3568.349
the spikes it doesn't stop people smokes

3562.289 --> 3570.5690000000004
here like 20 quid a pack now yeah yeah I

3568.349 --> 3572.13
know but someone did come out and say it

3570.569 --> 3575.849
this wasn't good the people have come

3572.13 --> 3580.44
out in different fields and blowing the

3575.849 --> 3582.42
whistle not just no no no was I'm sorry

3580.44 --> 3585.239
to interrupt about this moon missions

3582.42 --> 3586.859
that you believed that they took place

3585.239 --> 3591.39
in the late sixties and early seventies

3586.859 --> 3592.65
six moon missions now why and I think I

3591.39 --> 3595.049
know the answer you're gonna give me a

3592.65 --> 3597.15
couple you know the same dance that I

3595.049 --> 3599.64
have been given while we haven't been

3597.15 --> 3600.509
back to the moon go well let's start the

3599.64 --> 3606.1189999999997
music shall we

3600.509 --> 3609.809
you wanna dance I don't want to dance

3606.119 --> 3611.7000000000003
man I got two left feet seriously well

3609.809 --> 3614.579
what's no why do you think we haven't I

3611.7 --> 3619.64
know there's been no incentive to go

3614.579 --> 3619.6400000000003
there why would we go back to the moon

3620.599 --> 3625.9500000000003
how about we got better cameras with we

3624.18 --> 3629.3689999999997
got where our instruments to measure

3625.95 --> 3631.5589999999997
things and many many other things

3629.369 --> 3633.569
no sir we can do the easiest things to

3631.559 --> 3635.579
mention well our technology has

3633.569 --> 3636.8089999999997
increased to a level that we don't have

3635.579 --> 3639.15
to go to the moon to do those

3636.809 --> 3640.9500000000003
measurements we can send other

3639.15 --> 3645.63
instruments there we don't have the

3640.95 --> 3649.799
solely send humans they disagree he has

3645.63 --> 3651.9
to be manned missions why humans

3649.799 --> 3654.089
disregard you must make the machines so

3651.9 --> 3657.319
humans are better then we base

3654.089 --> 3657.319
everything on the fact that

3659.2 --> 3664.5699999999997
Paden do is it do we not base everything

3662.68 --> 3667.06
on the assumption that if it's the same

3664.57 --> 3668.589
size as Venus based everything what do

3667.06 --> 3670.839
you main place everything the scales

3668.589 --> 3673.2999999999997
everything in the unite those countries

3670.839 --> 3676.18
are flowing on it on it but I love jump

3673.3 --> 3678.76
the paddy from the moon to Venus so much

3676.18 --> 3685.66
all that's happened in the moon for a

3678.76 --> 3688.0890000000004
minute okay sir yeah because I heard the

3685.66 --> 3690.54
new technology the technology that is

3688.089 --> 3694.18
up-to-date as for right now the modern

3690.54 --> 3695.98
the the future is now we cannot go to

3694.18 --> 3698.2599999999998
the moon yet because there the

3695.98 --> 3700.27
technology doesn't doesn't it's not

3698.26 --> 3702.579
gonna take the heat of the space of this

3700.27 --> 3703.15
trottle you know the trip from earth to

3702.579 --> 3705.099
the moon

3703.15 --> 3710.31
so the technology has to be improve a

3705.099 --> 3712.78
little bit is that a valid excuse yeah

3710.31 --> 3715.7799999999997
I'm not sure the science entity

3712.78 --> 3720.7200000000003
technicalities required and equipment

3715.78 --> 3723.0400000000004
needed to go to the moon today are you

3720.72 --> 3725.23
yeah so let's say okay let's do this

3723.04 --> 3729.4
analogy right are you required are we

3725.23 --> 3732.28
both well educated enough to know what's

3729.4 --> 3737.53
required to go to the moon today well I

3732.28 --> 3741.9700000000003
take a really good balloon and hang a

3737.53 --> 3744.9700000000003
bucket of water on it preferably sealed

3741.97 --> 3747.49
in a careful way and then send it off

3744.97 --> 3750.3999999999996
because yeah once the moon passes over

3747.49 --> 3753.2799999999997
that moon should draw the water towards

3750.4 --> 3756.46
it allowing the balloon to transit the

3753.28 --> 3758.3190000000004
almost vacuum of space into the light

3756.46 --> 3759.9700000000003
atmosphere of the moon so that would be

3758.319 --> 3764.14
a great way to get there what do you

3759.97 --> 3765.3689999999997
guys think I think that was one of the

3764.14 --> 3770.5
jokes we were trying to do at the

3765.369 --> 3772.03
beginning of this hang it wasn't a good

3770.5 --> 3773.74
one no for real don't you think it's

3772.03 --> 3776.9500000000003
necessary to have better foolish

3773.74 --> 3780.339
pictures to analyze aim better peak

3776.95 --> 3783.0099999999998
sauce better forgive 4k quality because

3780.339 --> 3784.93
if we have been there I'm back it

3783.01 --> 3787.17
doesn't have to be a man mission now now

3784.93 --> 3790.81
this is what I'm saying they can send a

3787.17 --> 3793.06
spaceship to orbit in quote the moon and

3790.81 --> 3796.65
take pictures of video in 4k

3793.06 --> 3798.82
analyze lip freakin blooming magnifying

3796.65 --> 3800.65
they're not done that happy know you

3798.82 --> 3802.36
somebody haven't done that know their

3800.65 --> 3805.69
close-up pictures of the moon that we

3802.36 --> 3807.55
have is the ship quality from the sixty

3805.69 --> 3809.89
nine and seven is they have been in

3807.55 --> 3812.02
quotes they say orbit the moon but not

3809.89 --> 3814.0299999999997
close enough to take 4k footage or

3812.02 --> 3816.4
high-definition 1080p footage

3814.03 --> 3819.01
ensure the best images of the moon with

3816.4 --> 3821.4100000000003
we've got is from the 60s and 70s ah

3819.01 --> 3824.5600000000004
maybe they have more they play from the

3821.41 --> 3827.14
eighties and nineties not manumission 4k

3824.56 --> 3829.21
and 1080p quality no no the best quality

3827.14 --> 3833.17
we got better than the halogen out they

3829.21 --> 3835.2400000000002
will get better polish and so I think

3833.17 --> 3837.28
the focus has been on Mars personally

3835.24 --> 3838.81
but that's a different subject I suppose

3837.28 --> 3847.03
I mean yeah that does suck up a lot of

3838.81 --> 3849.46
resources and money but they did it for

3847.03 --> 3851.8300000000004
just ahem for a small amount of money

3849.46 --> 3853.96
before this is my issue

3851.83 --> 3856.5099999999998
why what's why they have to build a new

3853.96 --> 3858.4900000000002
spaceship to go to the to do to go to

3856.51 --> 3861.28
the Moon or Mars now they can use the

3858.49 --> 3863.5899999999997
old technology is like me used in an old

3861.28 --> 3865.96
car to travel across the country the car

3863.59 --> 3868.09
took me in the in the early seventies

3865.96 --> 3869.7400000000002
the car drove me across the country why

3868.09 --> 3873.13
I cannot drive the same car to do the

3869.74 --> 3873.97
same trip now why well you can that's

3873.13 --> 3875.86
not a problem

3873.97 --> 3878.68
but a new car would have a lot more

3875.86 --> 3881.17
safety features like airbags and abs and

3878.68 --> 3884.1699999999996
you know independent suspension and all

3881.17 --> 3885.9700000000003
those sorts of modern technologies so if

3884.17 --> 3887.38
you had the option to drive an old car

3885.97 --> 3889.3799999999997
or a new car which one would you drive

3887.38 --> 3892.57
which one would you feel more safer in

3889.38 --> 3894.61
if I if there's a need to do the trip I

3892.57 --> 3897.84
don't want to wait I'll use the old car

3894.61 --> 3897.84
because if I gotta wait

3897.97 --> 3905.0499999999997
I personally wouldn't heat a car that

3900.79 --> 3907.54
would had at least did steer enforcement

3905.05 --> 3910.8100000000004
that kind of thing and then for the rest

3907.54 --> 3916.81
released electronics possible because

3910.81 --> 3918.61
the more I wouldn't wouldn't use a car

3916.81 --> 3922.84
you'd use that transportation spilled

3918.61 --> 3924.85
you passed yet night no I don't I was no

3922.84 --> 3926.2000000000003
I don't use so teleport you know for

3924.85 --> 3928.63
that that's forbidden in

3926.2 --> 3930.43
physical I was doing a joke man come on

3928.63 --> 3935.34
it was funny and I'm responding with it

3930.43 --> 3937.81
oh I wrote okay you sent it serious

3935.34 --> 3944.71
yeah I am but that doesn't mean I'm not

3937.81 --> 3946.99
joking serious yeah so what do you think

3944.71 --> 3949.15
because we haven't been back because we

3946.99 --> 3951.2799999999997
got we cannot go back today even if we

3949.15 --> 3954.2200000000003
want to even with the old technology we

3951.28 --> 3957.01
cannot because is no blueprints is no

3954.22 --> 3960.3999999999996
telemetric data is nothing so you cannot

3957.01 --> 3962.5200000000004
go today if you want to so really really

3960.4 --> 3966.2400000000002
does it that's happening for real

3962.52 --> 3969.7
hmm yeah why is that happening anything

3966.24 --> 3975.97
because they they destroyed their

3969.7 --> 3983.3799999999997
technology to go to the moon why man why

3975.97 --> 3987.64
really it's it's old technology oh my

3983.38 --> 3989.92
god hmm very old

3987.64 --> 3991.45
yeah that that's it dad that's it I

3989.92 --> 3993.04
heard I heard that oh I mean I heard

3991.45 --> 3994.7799999999997
this bloke what am i and him having it

3993.04 --> 3996.97
like really you would you destroying all

3994.78 --> 3999.8700000000003
technology because when one floors no

3996.97 --> 4003.02
don't have a replacement for it don't

3999.87 --> 4007.5299999999997
know it's normal with with like

4003.02 --> 4010.53
worldwide achievements in science to

4007.53 --> 4013.0800000000004
destroy the proof that's that's what

4010.53 --> 4016.32
people usually do but what drives an

4013.08 --> 4019.38
organization its money yeah yeah exactly

4016.32 --> 4021.78
so destroyed roof makes perfect sense

4019.38 --> 4023.4300000000003
right it's too expensive to try and do

4021.78 --> 4025.2900000000004
that again it's too old no I'm not

4023.43 --> 4027.81
talking about doing again I'm talking

4025.29 --> 4033.05
about destroying that which was already

4027.81 --> 4036.39
produced why would a historically

4033.05 --> 4038.2200000000003
scientific event look I've given you my

4036.39 --> 4042.87
idea it doesn't concern much does it

4038.22 --> 4045.33
cost money to stash this stuff is is

4042.87 --> 4050.7599999999998
that a problem especially to NASA with

4045.33 --> 4051.5699999999997
their record budget ever why would they

4050.76 --> 4054.7200000000003
destroy it

4051.57 --> 4058.59
what is the sound reasoning for

4054.72 --> 4060.5989999999997
was well giving you my thoughts no but

4058.59 --> 4064.56
you haven't given your responses this

4060.599 --> 4068.4500000000003
specific conundrum and can you repeat

4064.56 --> 4072.96
the conundrum why did they destroy

4068.45 --> 4077.1499999999996
historical scientific evidence what

4072.96 --> 4081.3
would be the reason to do such a thing

4077.15 --> 4082.98
I don't know do you know do you know

4081.3 --> 4083.7000000000003
what reason I think you think of only

4082.98 --> 4085.8
one thing

4083.7 --> 4090.5699999999997
no but do you know the reasons I've

4085.8 --> 4091.29
actually given the reasons is it was an

4090.57 --> 4095.13
accident

4091.29 --> 4104.009
they've said that yeah okay that's how

4095.13 --> 4106.35
you obviously don't believe it yeah what

4104.009 --> 4108.54
are the mystical ships but they lost the

4106.35 --> 4111.0
telemetric data so they lost the

4108.54 --> 4113.37
telemetry data all the information and

4111.0 --> 4117.39
they destroyed the technology so what

4113.37 --> 4119.91
was nothing but they didn't give an

4117.39 --> 4124.14
excuse for it they just said this is

4119.91 --> 4125.13
what we did yeah they say they destroyed

4124.14 --> 4128.31
it because they were building new

4125.13 --> 4129.66
equipment futuristic with new technology

4128.31 --> 4131.1900000000005
that's what they say we destroyed it

4129.66 --> 4132.66
because we're building new stuff now

4131.19 --> 4134.8189999999995
well there you go

4132.66 --> 4136.7699999999995
yeah so let me share you a little detail

4134.819 --> 4140.7300000000005
about the world of scientific

4136.77 --> 4142.92
development okay when some massive thing

4140.73 --> 4145.62
happens in the world of science an

4142.92 --> 4147.65
experiment that's supposedly repeatable

4145.62 --> 4151.589
and has recorded evidence and all that

4147.65 --> 4154.349999999999
when the actual source material is

4151.589 --> 4156.42
destroyed by the party that conducted

4154.35 --> 4161.9400000000005
these experiments and that recorded the

4156.42 --> 4166.29
data that is overall a very very blatant

4161.94 --> 4169.349999999999
sign that there is something wrong with

4166.29 --> 4174.29
the material that requires destroying in

4169.35 --> 4176.759
order to cover up the mistakes or the

4174.29 --> 4180.63
falsifications that took place

4176.759 --> 4182.7
that is the only logical reason for such

4180.63 --> 4185.7
things to happen otherwise if there was

4182.7 --> 4188.22
nothing to cover up in any sense the

4185.7 --> 4191.489
entire organization would have that

4188.22 --> 4195.21
material encased in a glass featuring in

4191.489 --> 4197.459999999999
a museum with guards to prevent anything

4195.21 --> 4199.86
from happening it including old age

4197.46 --> 4203.64
because it would be the most valuable

4199.86 --> 4206.0599999999995
historical commodity ever produced

4203.64 --> 4209.070000000001
pretty much Dan unless so much real

4206.06 --> 4214.02
unless of course someone might have [ __ ]

4209.07 --> 4218.25
up and destroyed it how about everything

4214.02 --> 4223.97
else where is that but still just in

4218.25 --> 4228.239
Nassau's basement everything what else

4223.97 --> 4232.01
everything else what the rest of all the

4228.239 --> 4235.65
data all the recordings everything

4232.01 --> 4240.95
where's the University the museum with

4235.65 --> 4247.589999999999
open archives basically I don't know I

4240.95 --> 4249.57
write yeah they got a museum with

4247.59 --> 4255.360000000001
petrified rocks I mean moon rocks

4249.57 --> 4257.79
somewhere hey come on down we got one in

4255.36 --> 4260.46
the well yeah yeah you don't know if

4257.79 --> 4262.59
there were originally trees on the moon

4260.46 --> 4265.95
maybe it was inhabited hey if it was a

4262.59 --> 4269.1
chunk of the earth being hit and smashed

4265.95 --> 4271.08
out of the Earth's orbit there were

4269.1 --> 4278.13
trees that eventually petrified

4271.08 --> 4280.08
if yeah well I suppose you could I could

4278.13 --> 4281.18
sit here and say that that's a

4280.08 --> 4283.71
possibility

4281.18 --> 4288.05
but there are people that are more

4283.71 --> 4294.57
knowledgeable than me so should I

4288.05 --> 4296.88
instantly pin them as lies or incorrect

4294.57 --> 4298.95
I mean they've studied this longer than

4296.88 --> 4302.16
I have I've studied it for probably zero

4298.95 --> 4305.28
time no but you need to take the data

4302.16 --> 4310.15
into consideration and be honest about

4305.28 --> 4313.75
it and then judge accordingly judge by

4310.15 --> 4318.79
their fruits that is the law of God of

4313.75 --> 4321.219
Jesus but the results not my ideas not

4318.79 --> 4325.57
the concepts the results and the

4321.219 --> 4330.4890000000005
material food is the results what sorry

4325.57 --> 4332.17
what's the law the law boy who God then

4330.489 --> 4336.009999999999
that's how it works you judge things by

4332.17 --> 4338.4400000000005
the fruits why there what's real what's

4336.01 --> 4340.4800000000005
tangible thank you yeah that's Indian

4338.44 --> 4342.969
will take nothing the individual person

4340.48 --> 4343.239
I don't agree or disagree with it all

4342.969 --> 4345.64
right

4343.239 --> 4349.12
are all how're you all discussing from

4345.64 --> 4350.77
the same concept like the law where the

4349.12 --> 4354.19
law comes from not me

4350.77 --> 4360.01
no we're not what's your stance on

4354.19 --> 4362.259999999999
religion as I I stopped believing in

4360.01 --> 4364.030000000001
everything even in religion when I found

4362.26 --> 4367.360000000001
flattered I'm trying to take the more

4364.03 --> 4369.699
direct human possible way without with

4367.36 --> 4371.0199999999995
the less belief possible I was a

4369.699 --> 4373.178999999999
Christian born in a Christian

4371.02 --> 4375.040000000001
environment and I dropped everything

4373.179 --> 4376.9
that I knew about the Bible because I

4375.04 --> 4378.85
didn't want to believe in anything so

4376.9 --> 4381.5199999999995
I'm looking at this flower without any

4378.85 --> 4385.63
religion again that whatsoever you know

4381.52 --> 4388.6
I am a little but what I just said is

4385.63 --> 4391.4490000000005
not true because it's written in a book

4388.6 --> 4394.2390000000005
or because certain priests say it in

4391.449 --> 4400.419999999999
this world it is true because it is true

4394.239 --> 4402.909
it is a one of the wiser lessons of this

4400.42 --> 4405.1900000000005
amazing person which is one of the

4402.909 --> 4408.82
greatest example of how to walk a

4405.19 --> 4411.78
straight path experience for a human

4408.82 --> 4415.599999999999
being and them by their fruits

4411.78 --> 4417.159
because the results that's how long how

4415.6 --> 4421.39
long would you say you you've been a

4417.159 --> 4426.3099999999995
believer in Jesus it depends on what you

4421.39 --> 4428.92
define as believer in Jesus what do you

4426.31 --> 4432.31
define it is I think there was a

4428.92 --> 4434.32
miraculous person in this world and how

4432.31 --> 4437.700000000001
long have you believed that to be the

4434.32 --> 4442.2
case and God

4437.7 --> 4446.2699999999995
for since we Waterloo there are years

4442.2 --> 4449.7
but I've always varied it's different

4446.27 --> 4452.1900000000005
intuitively there was something about it

4449.7 --> 4453.66
if did you go to school can I finish

4452.19 --> 4455.669999999999
answer the question I'm sorry

4453.66 --> 4458.91
from the beginning on from basically

4455.67 --> 4461.7
when I started to become a person I felt

4458.91 --> 4465.87
there was something I have always known

4461.7 --> 4468.57
there is God when do you but I better

4465.87 --> 4473.91
what that was is something completely a

4468.57 --> 4476.009999999999
separate case I avoid I'm not finished

4473.91 --> 4479.4
yet this is gonna take at least two more

4476.01 --> 4483.9800000000005
minutes okay sorry right I'm gonna just

4479.4 --> 4488.009999999999
say saying look then when I got older I

4483.98 --> 4490.62
took my ego basically my teenage ego

4488.01 --> 4492.150000000001
took things into his own hands and

4490.62 --> 4495.24
declared that there was basically

4492.15 --> 4497.36
nothing certain I was trying to be ultra

4495.24 --> 4500.3099999999995
skeptic virtue cycling to science

4497.36 --> 4505.17
basically that's what that was for me

4500.31 --> 4507.9800000000005
and I've never really believed in Christ

4505.17 --> 4511.05
I was actually kind of allergic to him

4507.98 --> 4514.41
although I could not help but in my

4511.05 --> 4516.96
admire the energy that came with the

4514.41 --> 4519.72
concept not the people but the actual

4516.96 --> 4522.3
resource material itself the writings

4519.72 --> 4525.84
about him thinks that he was called it

4522.3 --> 4528.27
saying the thoughts and feelings

4525.84 --> 4530.97
concerning him that was always very

4528.27 --> 4534.4800000000005
special but yeah I rejected religion I

4530.97 --> 4537.570000000001
rejected the hierarchy of of religion

4534.48 --> 4541.169999999999
and avoided it and basically forgot

4537.57 --> 4543.719999999999
about it and now yeah I've went through

4541.17 --> 4545.1900000000005
all kinds of creepy [ __ ] and everything

4543.72 --> 4547.92
and I'll talk about a dark world

4545.19 --> 4553.71
experiences and now I figured out pretty

4547.92 --> 4556.3
late on that yeah there is something

4553.71 --> 4559.179
really more to it and I

4556.3 --> 4562.150000000001
through my father and through people my

4559.179 --> 4565.3
father knows about the the Rudolf

4562.15 --> 4569.98
Steiner approach of Christianity you

4565.3 --> 4572.559
could call it a melange between paganism

4569.98 --> 4574.9
and Christianity what else is new but

4572.559 --> 4579.820000000001
it's very different and it is very

4574.9 --> 4582.429
spiritual technical it is extremely well

4579.82 --> 4583.9
defined in a surprising manner and

4582.429 --> 4587.2300000000005
that's what makes it really interesting

4583.9 --> 4591.429
so do I believe in Christ of the Bible

4587.23 --> 4595.29
in a literal fashion as everything that

4591.429 --> 4599.409
is suggested about him not necessarily I

4595.29 --> 4601.119
am open to it because I don't know

4599.409 --> 4603.129999999999
necessarily because it's things that

4601.119 --> 4607.63
other people have declared but what I do

4603.13 --> 4611.05
know is that the essence of him what can

4607.63 --> 4613.900000000001
be observed even now in the present from

4611.05 --> 4617.349
what happened in the past that that is

4613.9 --> 4619.629999999999
very special and that it is meant I can

4617.349 --> 4623.139
feel this you can feel this from within

4619.63 --> 4627.13
it it was meant as an example as an

4623.139 --> 4629.7390000000005
example for individuals on how to do

4627.13 --> 4634.21
things right how to heal and repair the

4629.739 --> 4637.989
world in times of great darkness and how

4634.21 --> 4641.02
to build a new individualism culture

4637.989 --> 4644.169999999999
surrounding the path and staying focused

4641.02 --> 4647.530000000001
not being seduced and not being

4644.17 --> 4649.77
depressed but walking straight for it

4647.53 --> 4654.67
that is my approach it's a very personal

4649.77 --> 4657.329000000001
religious approach and it's always going

4654.67 --> 4660.76
to be an individual in an individualism

4657.329 --> 4663.579
religion because it has no hierarchy the

4660.76 --> 4665.8
high-roller has the individual yes there

4663.579 --> 4668.199
has some commendable qualities about it

4665.8 --> 4670.63
now one that's good thank you

4668.199 --> 4673.138999999999
that was it sorry for taking so long but

4670.63 --> 4678.04
it's a very scary subject to me so

4673.139 --> 4680.8
you're sure all right so did you ever go

4678.04 --> 4685.119
to Sunday school or Church at an early

4680.8 --> 4691.570000000001
age I did have Bible class

4685.119 --> 4693.25
okay hopefully interested in it yeah how

4691.57 --> 4696.489
old were you when that when you started

4693.25 --> 4698.83
Bible class I wasn't really serious

4696.489 --> 4701.199
about it by the way we were mostly being

4698.83 --> 4703.48
read and I would have the times to fall

4701.199 --> 4710.138999999999
asleep but it felt really interesting to

4703.48 --> 4710.888999999999
listen to I was like maybe eight and ten

4710.139 --> 4714.4800000000005
I think

4710.889 --> 4717.52
so you indoctrinated at an early age no

4714.48 --> 4720.098999999999
he told about it and I found it very

4717.52 --> 4725.349
fascinating we weren't forced to accept

4720.099 --> 4728.08
or even respond to any of it I was we

4725.349 --> 4731.110000000001
had religious instructions they called

4728.08 --> 4732.61
it and I had that in promise of also it

4731.11 --> 4734.799999999999
was probably around the same age as you

4732.61 --> 4741.88
that started I always found it

4734.8 --> 4745.78
interesting and questionable right hmm

4741.88 --> 4748.54
well I just Fermi is tremely fascinating

4745.78 --> 4751.48
because of the the depth what is going

4748.54 --> 4752.889
on the seriousness I guess what I'm

4751.48 --> 4757.48
trying to say here is when you talk

4752.889 --> 4759.849
about indoctrination it works both ways

4757.48 --> 4762.098999999999
if you're gonna argue it for one side of

4759.849 --> 4763.33
the fence it can be also argued for the

4762.099 --> 4766.63
other side of the fence

4763.33 --> 4769.03
in what sense well people people say

4766.63 --> 4773.38
that the school system induction makes

4769.03 --> 4775.199
people into science I want to believe

4773.38 --> 4777.929
you know what it's not it's not even

4775.199 --> 4781.57
scientism doctrine aids into a

4777.929 --> 4784.869
presuppositional acceptance yeah you

4781.57 --> 4786.3099999999995
must accept a presupposition that is

4784.869 --> 4789.73
what it's doing that's the actual

4786.31 --> 4792.909000000001
indoctrination yeah yeah and religion is

4789.73 --> 4794.848999999999
the same this is no domination there but

4792.909 --> 4798.46
that all depends on the nature of it

4794.849 --> 4801.099
okay yes sure maybe some churches but

4798.46 --> 4803.349
church schools will force their students

4801.099 --> 4805.81
to like you must do this you must do

4803.349 --> 4808.869000000001
that you must report that kind of thing

4805.81 --> 4811.599
but I never regret any of that I don't

4808.869 --> 4817.518999999999
think that that's even allowed in

4811.599 --> 4820.9890000000005
well with with religion you've got more

4817.519 --> 4823.7300000000005
people will choose not to follow it then

4820.989 --> 4825.98
the typical standard schooling system

4823.73 --> 4830.329
the indoctrination that you speak of for

4825.98 --> 4831.919999999999
example indoctrination that can but that

4830.329 --> 4834.88
kind of system has been pretty much

4831.92 --> 4837.05
outlawed in the Netherlands

4834.88 --> 4842.150000000001
you can only do that in private

4837.05 --> 4845.719
occasions sorry which indoctrination is

4842.15 --> 4851.659
that you're talking about Christian okay

4845.719 --> 4854.119
that level that's not by school not by

4851.659 --> 4856.579
the enforced school system because yeah

4854.119 --> 4857.63
you have to go to school it's mandatory

4856.579 --> 4860.599
great

4857.63 --> 4862.849
well like I don't have that mandatorily

4860.599 --> 4865.909000000001
done to you if you want your kids to be

4862.849 --> 4867.34
indoctrinated with a certain religion

4865.909 --> 4869.42
you're going to do the indoctrination

4867.34 --> 4871.28
yourself on your own time that's

4869.42 --> 4873.2300000000005
basically how yeah yeah it's pretty

4871.28 --> 4875.599
pretty much the same here in Melbourne

4873.23 --> 4876.199
there you know in Australia they've done

4875.599 --> 4878.329
away with

4876.199 --> 4881.839999999999
oh they haven't completely done away

4878.329 --> 4884.389
with it it's a choice now 7-charles

4881.84 --> 4887.499
installed and aspire to use the

4884.389 --> 4891.679
regulations for religious indoctrination

4887.499 --> 4895.63
cultural indoctrination and scientism

4891.679 --> 4899.15
indoctrination is going full-throttle

4895.63 --> 4901.219
also over here it's terrible its total

4899.15 --> 4904.369
social justice warrior training on every

4901.219 --> 4907.639
level every level every age without

4904.369 --> 4911.44
limits just as bad as in the Americas

4907.639 --> 4916.46
except there is some back Bush so it is

4911.44 --> 4918.98
not the ultra extremist psycho stuff but

4916.46 --> 4921.32
on the other hand yeah a lot of kids do

4918.98 --> 4923.718999999999
suddenly get like transsexual operations

4921.32 --> 4927.369
like pre-teenage that kind of [ __ ] it

4923.719 --> 4929.749
does happen and I find it very creepy

4927.369 --> 4931.549999999999
but I don't know what to think about it

4929.749 --> 4933.889
other than that but yeah indoctrination

4931.55 --> 4935.719
and creepy stuff does happen in that

4933.889 --> 4938.41
sense in the schools here in the

4935.719 --> 4942.4
Netherlands and

4938.41 --> 4946.09
have all of that trouble that yeah here

4942.4 --> 4950.469999999999
as well although yeah on the other hand

4946.09 --> 4953.17
it is so weird when you're are when

4950.47 --> 4954.9400000000005
you're like me and have kind of social

4953.17 --> 4956.68
skills kind of to understand how these

4954.94 --> 4961.299999999999
people work no matter how warped they

4956.68 --> 4962.77
are in a certain way then they handle

4961.3 --> 4965.47
you just fine

4962.77 --> 4969.1
it's only when you are socially inept

4965.47 --> 4971.38
and antisocial in your behavior very ego

4969.1 --> 4976.27
driven and offensive all that that's

4971.38 --> 4980.17
when they all go completely nuts but I

4976.27 --> 4982.59
don't get them really well that's the

4980.17 --> 4985.45
difference I guess between religion and

4982.59 --> 4987.64
science if you like I was not talking

4985.45 --> 4989.95
about religion in this case talking

4987.64 --> 4996.33
about whoa the Marxist internal

4989.95 --> 4996.33
revolution and scientism yeah okay

4998.659 --> 5004.2699999999995
because yeah with religion yeah that

5001.179 --> 5006.1
does exist I know it does like within

5004.27 --> 5006.75
religious group there is a lot of peer

5006.1 --> 5012.159000000001
pressure

5006.75 --> 5014.62
well yeah funny try push each other I'll

5012.159 --> 5017.739
bring it I want to bring it back a bit

5014.62 --> 5022.03
to the differences I guess between

5017.739 --> 5024.61
religion and science as science will

5022.03 --> 5027.58
travel down the same Road together all

5024.61 --> 5029.17
around the world but religion has got

5027.58 --> 5032.67
many different roads going in many

5029.17 --> 5037.84
different directions with many different

5032.67 --> 5040.659
signs but there's a cohesiveness with

5037.84 --> 5045.55
science there's all depends on the

5040.659 --> 5047.65
region of science yeah but it's more

5045.55 --> 5051.21
cohesive it's not so scatterbrained as

5047.65 --> 5054.73
religion I beg to differ

5051.21 --> 5059.949
good ok yeah religion tends to have

5054.73 --> 5062.049999999999
centered single books writings and the

5059.949 --> 5064.178999999999
interpretations of that it's a very

5062.05 --> 5068.320000000001
stable foundation well when you look in

5064.179 --> 5070.54
science there's a lot of things even in

5068.32 --> 5072.549999999999
the different regions that contradict

5070.54 --> 5075.34
each other technically but that just

5072.55 --> 5080.38
never touch because they're so far apart

5075.34 --> 5083.650000000001
so yeah science beauty of it and it's a

5080.38 --> 5087.04
mess it's the beauty of it no it's not

5083.65 --> 5090.4
beautiful it's unless it's not beautiful

5087.04 --> 5092.53
if things contradict each other no

5090.4 --> 5095.379999999999
that's what I wasn't going to say okay

5092.53 --> 5097.21
sorry the beauty of science is that you

5095.38 --> 5099.37
can put those together and work it out

5097.21 --> 5100.81
whereas with religion when you put the

5099.37 --> 5104.46
two different books together you end up

5100.81 --> 5106.9890000000005
with bloodshed and death not necessarily

5104.46 --> 5109.75
mostly history so kind of sure no that's

5106.989 --> 5112.53
the mostly right right yeah no people

5109.75 --> 5119.17
have died then survived right well yeah

5112.53 --> 5121.659
right right yeah well people start wars

5119.17 --> 5124.639
over technological domination and

5121.659 --> 5127.549999999999
knowledge so

5124.639 --> 5130.429
I'm not too sure if science hasn't

5127.55 --> 5134.709
already caught up with religion when it

5130.429 --> 5134.709
comes to genocidal activities really

5138.07 --> 5142.42
don't you think

5140.68 --> 5145.780000000001
sorry I was distracted what was that

5142.42 --> 5147.9400000000005
class question that I think that science

5145.78 --> 5151.69
let's just call it the body of science

5147.94 --> 5154.599999999999
has already caught off on religion when

5151.69 --> 5158.669999999999
it comes to genocide Oh average in

5154.6 --> 5158.67
activities wouldn't you agree

5161.94 --> 5168.46
or that I'm not sure what that means

5165.3 --> 5171.1
well you're saying all religion yeah

5168.46 --> 5172.99
when you try to figure out differences

5171.1 --> 5176.700000000001
that's bloodshed and war and genocide

5172.99 --> 5180.01
well look at what technology and

5176.7 --> 5187.05
scientific opinion know that has wrought

5180.01 --> 5190.780000000001
on its own hmm look at the level and

5187.05 --> 5195.72
intensity of genocides after the

5190.78 --> 5203.009999999999
transition seems to have increased

5195.72 --> 5206.7
dramatically in what way in the scale I

5203.01 --> 5206.7
don't remember

5208.5 --> 5217.45
300 million people being murdered in the

5211.51 --> 5220.84
course of a year before the 1700s that

5217.45 --> 5223.389999999999
kind of thing that just didn't exist if

5220.84 --> 5226.78
there was like ten thousand deaths that

5223.39 --> 5230.05
was a massacre and if people would have

5226.78 --> 5233.46
nightmares from that for decades and

5230.05 --> 5237.9400000000005
what was the motivation for these this

5233.46 --> 5240.25
control usually hmm bead religious

5237.94 --> 5245.139999999999
political control Nobles among one

5240.25 --> 5248.26
another strength strategical control but

5245.14 --> 5250.570000000001
yeah it was there really H with the

5248.26 --> 5254.14
revolutions that take place now since

5250.57 --> 5258.34
the early 20th century necessarily

5254.14 --> 5263.070000000001
hundreds of millions of people die very

5258.34 --> 5263.07
rapidly for even worse reasons

5263.75 --> 5268.32
well and it's not religiously driven

5266.52 --> 5274.59
it's you she's going to part right

5268.32 --> 5275.28
everything just be driven yeah yeah now

5274.59 --> 5279.119000000001
it's different

5275.28 --> 5283.079
oh really is it sounds great bass well

5279.119 --> 5284.549999999999
it's it was always great guys right so

5283.079 --> 5288.299999999999
what does it matter people what was

5284.55 --> 5291.53
their religion or non-religion matter in

5288.3 --> 5297.03
that sense it's an it's just a tool

5291.53 --> 5301.61
being wielded in a certain way oh yeah I

5297.03 --> 5305.28
guess it's a tool yeah it is a tool this

5301.61 --> 5309.9
or a tool of enlightenment well it can

5305.28 --> 5312.599
be either way can it can yeah yeah I'm

5309.9 --> 5315.138999999999
not saying it's the it's it's the cause

5312.599 --> 5319.559
of all wars I'm not saying that at all

5315.139 --> 5322.079
no but why what what was your loss of

5319.559 --> 5325.2300000000005
any war really but for what for what

5322.079 --> 5325.98
religion stands for there shouldn't be

5325.23 --> 5329.098999999999
any deaths

5325.98 --> 5332.848999999999
why are they because they're something

5329.099 --> 5334.9490000000005
other than just religion there is power

5332.849 --> 5338.82
struggle there's the ego there is the

5334.949 --> 5341.879999999999
corruption of power itself which one the

5338.82 --> 5345.509999999999
manifest anywhere especially in in big

5341.88 --> 5348.03
hierarchal hierarchical structures and

5345.51 --> 5354.9490000000005
he just whether this it - the big global

5348.03 --> 5359.9
deception comes from well

5354.949 --> 5362.678999999999
yes that's the hierarchical upper

5359.9 --> 5365.889999999999
echelon and the corruption they

5362.679 --> 5370.33
inevitably have endured and corrupted to

5365.89 --> 5374.4800000000005
what those people would have typically

5370.33 --> 5379.55
invented or politicized or cultural eyes

5374.48 --> 5383.239
the globe construct concept to use it to

5379.55 --> 5385.46
fool the masses and deprive them of

5383.239 --> 5391.669999999999
knowledge that they could use to escape

5385.46 --> 5395.3
control indeed if they're arranged and

5391.67 --> 5399.9490000000005
they will give us their power that is so

5395.3 --> 5403.55
that's in a sense that's that's spawned

5399.949 --> 5406.4
from religion historically because is a

5403.55 --> 5411.38
religion it is the same methodology just

5406.4 --> 5417.099999999999
a different angle of approach hmm they

5411.38 --> 5417.1
say I don't believe that human nature is

5418.989 --> 5428.049999999999
that's bad I suppose I'm not

5424.73 --> 5428.049999999999
articulating myself properly

5428.469 --> 5435.2300000000005
human nature is human nature

5432.28 --> 5442.61
as good it has dark sides in this good

5435.23 --> 5446.419999999999
sides and they will manifest so you

5442.61 --> 5449.089999999999
reckon you reckon equation demands you

5446.42 --> 5453.56
reckon a global conspiracy spanning

5449.09 --> 5455.06
decades generations in countries is

5453.56 --> 5458.75
possible centuries

5455.06 --> 5461.0
yes pluses acid Icarus decades yeah and

5458.75 --> 5466.51
I'd say Center hands I'm saying

5461.0 --> 5466.51
cemeteries yes yes possible

5467.0 --> 5471.59
well that's what you believed no I'm

5469.52 --> 5475.700000000001
pretty sure it is there's signs all over

5471.59 --> 5477.74
the place even historically to just put

5475.7 --> 5481.7
on everything together it was a plan and

5477.74 --> 5484.3099999999995
everyone well not everyone but a lot of

5481.7 --> 5487.849999999999
people throughout history were following

5484.31 --> 5491.240000000001
that plan using were losing the

5487.85 --> 5496.1
mechanism expanding on it defeating an

5491.24 --> 5501.17
overwhelming opponents rationally taking

5496.1 --> 5504.97
authority control erecting boards of

5501.17 --> 5504.97
education all that

5510.159 --> 5513.78
I have more faith in humans

5514.32 --> 5519.71
well I don't have faith in humanity as a

5520.519 --> 5526.59
as a I had don't have faith in the human

5523.86 --> 5534.679
mob mentality and in the nature to

5526.59 --> 5539.099
oversimplify and in the nature to be

5534.679 --> 5545.719
presuppositional abayas about things but

5539.099 --> 5548.909000000001
I do trust in the dynamic and yet the

5545.719 --> 5551.34
dynamic nature and the extremity

5548.909 --> 5554.638999999999
possibilities in a positive sense that

5551.34 --> 5559.05
humans have within them the human

5554.639 --> 5562.219
potential but the potential requires a

5559.05 --> 5568.59
certain method as indiscipline

5562.219 --> 5571.61
discipline and clarity to manifest so I

5568.59 --> 5580.289
don't have faith that if you leave

5571.61 --> 5582.69
humans that humans do like among one

5580.289 --> 5586.768999999999
another yeah they can be very positive

5582.69 --> 5590.489
influence but yeah well were they to be

5586.769 --> 5593.909000000001
isolated artificially somehow they would

5590.489 --> 5596.518999999999
all become animals again but it's only

5593.909 --> 5601.11
because they would be isolated because

5596.519 --> 5603.4800000000005
they'd have no no stimulation of the

5601.11 --> 5606.329
actual intellectual impulses of the

5603.48 --> 5607.919999999999
socializing of the moral impulses if

5606.329 --> 5610.799999999999
they have no stimulation of these

5607.92 --> 5612.929
impulses they will turn into beasts by

5610.8 --> 5615.78
the Mormons are among one another that

5612.929 --> 5620.0
tends to not happen there will be

5615.78 --> 5620.0
communication there will be stimulation

5623.019 --> 5627.849
yeah no that's that's that's where I

5625.15 --> 5629.369
come from oh I reckon this more good in

5627.849 --> 5633.78
humans the navel

5629.369 --> 5633.78
that's anyway that's my two cents

5653.84 --> 5661.52
all right dad we called I guess that

5659.06 --> 5664.25
normally I would be done with my hangout

5661.52 --> 5664.88
for today anyway all right sorry to hold

5664.25 --> 5667.94
you up mate

5664.88 --> 5670.43
no no no no no I was actually planning

5667.94 --> 5675.08
on doing a longer hang out and I do like

5670.43 --> 5677.4800000000005
this company should but but I would like

5675.08 --> 5679.97
some more guests though it's not that

5677.48 --> 5683.87
you're a boring gasps absolutely I love

5679.97 --> 5687.530000000001
your questions but I can't get just like

5683.87 --> 5690.349999999999
do this another hour I think so you

5687.53 --> 5693.88
can't no but you can not not just the

5690.35 --> 5696.59
two of us not so many things already

5693.88 --> 5698.03
yeah we'll have all my Swedish my second

5696.59 --> 5704.32
whiskey so I probably couldn't do it for

5698.03 --> 5708.139999999999
another Railway anyway myself oh I might

5704.32 --> 5711.2
how long will being going for for one

5708.14 --> 5715.09
and a half hour little over that it

5711.2 --> 5720.62
would probably cause enough grief time

5715.09 --> 5725.78
maybe I've been trolled alot and Oh God

5720.62 --> 5728.87
why didn't you go aways go away be me no

5725.78 --> 5730.219999999999
not you as freaking America's Sokcho he

5728.87 --> 5732.349999999999
keeps on respawning

5730.22 --> 5740.150000000001
it's a stupid troll has nothing to

5732.35 --> 5742.910000000001
contribute so anyway alright hopefully I

5740.15 --> 5744.74
do you mind do you trust me enough to

5742.91 --> 5747.08
mean to bring people along to send the

5744.74 --> 5750.92
link out or why not venture trust you

5747.08 --> 5753.32
know don't do that not now no but you

5750.92 --> 5756.2
can you can suggest somebody but don't

5753.32 --> 5757.46
do it of course of course I'll run it

5756.2 --> 5759.59
for you first all right

5757.46 --> 5763.64
there's no problem I think you're wise

5759.59 --> 5767.360000000001
to give you a hand up a leg up things

5763.64 --> 5770.54
appreciate it but I do want to get know

5767.36 --> 5773.2699999999995
people first over Skype yeah sure

5770.54 --> 5776.66
or yeah look there's another setting

5773.27 --> 5779.21
where if I have some reliable security

5776.66 --> 5781.63
like a Randy or Riley that could have

5779.21 --> 5784.41
covered the back chat besides me myself

5781.63 --> 5787.8
then I might eventually

5784.41 --> 5792.0
they have open panels again and yeah and

5787.8 --> 5795.570000000001
anything can happen but okay yeah by

5792.0 --> 5799.1
default I I don't want to do that people

5795.57 --> 5801.84
practice we had to use the controls II

5799.1 --> 5806.1900000000005
know but it's just a hassle to run a

5801.84 --> 5808.32
show and chat and be a host and at the

5806.19 --> 5810.69
same time keep it an eye on the back

5808.32 --> 5813.42
Chet it's just too much trouble it's

5810.69 --> 5815.58
like three tasks at simultaneously and

5813.42 --> 5817.32
so I will just need some backup of

5815.58 --> 5820.59
people that know how to deal with that

5817.32 --> 5822.57
stuff maybe maybe you need a baby

5820.59 --> 5831.26
daughter Nathan seems to get Eleanor to

5822.57 --> 5836.91
help I'm joking I'm joking bad joke

5831.26 --> 5842.610000000001
alright my painful joke cuz yeah sure

5836.91 --> 5844.5
you need a woman to have it first oh I

5842.61 --> 5847.53
wasn't suggesting a woman just a child

5844.5 --> 5850.83
in general no I don't if I want a child

5847.53 --> 5853.86
then I like to have a woman with that

5850.83 --> 5862.98
thank you very much yeah it's kind of

5853.86 --> 5867.179999999999
handy no not have my daughter or son to

5862.98 --> 5870.15
have a mother that's up to the task and

5867.18 --> 5872.04
that's quite something because if it's

5870.15 --> 5876.8099999999995
gonna be just half me that's gonna be

5872.04 --> 5879.54
quite a struggle you'll have me to help

5876.81 --> 5881.01
you out with that it'll it'll only be

5879.54 --> 5883.41
half the struggle might could only be

5881.01 --> 5886.38
half years yeah and as I said I'm there

5883.41 --> 5889.349999999999
to actually help out well which will

5886.38 --> 5891.84
helps a lot because I I know what it's

5889.35 --> 5895.4400000000005
gonna be like sure but that could mean

5891.84 --> 5898.35
it's one and a half times the trouble no

5895.44 --> 5900.36
I'm not gonna turn into okay no I'm not

5898.35 --> 5902.76
gonna do that to the mother of my child
