41.0 --> 48.480000000000004
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

45.12 --> 52.169999999999995

so you know when I'm going live which is

59.33 --> 65.339
standard 2 o'clock p.m. Amsterdam time

63.3 --> 69.3
but sometimes I can go a little bit

65.339 --> 73.02
early on line like today because I was

69.3 --> 79.41
sick of waiting so yeah hit that Bell

73.02 --> 81.14999999999999
and please add me on skype if you want

79.41 --> 85.32
to be part of the panel on a regular

81.15 --> 87.81
basis or if you want to support my

channel please donate to the super chat

87.81 --> 96.899
to my paypal or become part of my

90.21 --> 99.38999999999999
patreon and yes today is I don't know

96.899 --> 103.979
it's kind of windy and cloudy it's weird

99.39 --> 109.5
it's still warm but because of all the

103.979 --> 113.19
shade and I have to say it's probably a

109.5 --> 117.209
lot of it is chemtrail induced from very

113.19 --> 119.58
early in the morning the clouds do kind

117.209 --> 121.979
of look like that but it's still

119.58 --> 129.97899999999998
decently warm not as warm as yesterday

121.979 --> 134.73
though and but anyway it's still nice

129.979 --> 140.51000000000002
it's on average warmer in inside weirdly

134.73 --> 140.51
enough so let's see who's in chat

146.29 --> 157.25
right so the righteous force alley bah

151.52 --> 168.17000000000002
am drunken bullet over McCool right

157.25 --> 169.82
ha you're there early it's kind of

168.17 --> 175.42999999999998
getting used to for me like YouTube

169.82 --> 178.79
seems to have changed the way they

175.43 --> 180.89000000000001
present the screen now every time you

178.79 --> 183.14
put up a new video it doesn't

180.89 --> 185.6
automatically play maybe I turned

183.14 --> 188.39
something off but you have to click it

185.6 --> 190.28
now I have to click it and even with

188.39 --> 192.79999999999998
live stream so it's kind of annoying

190.28 --> 196.64000000000001
because immediately immediately you fall

192.8 --> 204.739
behind I don't know I should look at my

196.64 --> 209.73899999999998
settings probably now a hello the plain

204.739 --> 209.739
truth Anna Dean brand M

210.2 --> 216.41
right so yes that yesterday I wasn't

214.37 --> 219.68
there I said a lot of people in chat

216.41 --> 225.95
basically popping in like oh yeah sorry

219.68 --> 230.209
about that it was kind of sudden we have

225.95 --> 233.14999999999998
been postponing hangouts I mean the

230.209 --> 235.58
indie sessions for a couple of times now

233.15 --> 238.16
and it was set to Monday and then

235.58 --> 240.62
suddenly everybody said pretty much I

238.16 --> 243.44
think on Sunday I didn't see the message

240.62 --> 246.799
until the last minute almost or well

243.44 --> 249.95
until the morning that they decided to

246.799 --> 251.989
do it to basically do it in the

249.95 --> 256.13
afternoon as well make a long day

251.989 --> 257.87
session from it of it so yeah I needed

256.13 --> 260.419
to prepare properly for that because

257.87 --> 263.12
yeah a day session

260.419 --> 265.639
you can't go in and prepared because

263.12 --> 269.03000000000003
it's just too much room for things to

265.639 --> 271.61
really happen and it did it was it was

269.03 --> 277.0
really good it was innovating it was a

271.61 --> 277.0
talk a pure talk session and design and

278.35 --> 287.53900000000004
city planning exactly like I showed you

282.789 --> 292.94
and some sort of interactions with the

287.539 --> 297.55
drought Dark Elves and it was

292.94 --> 300.46999999999997
interesting for me and I managed to

297.55 --> 301.22
basically improvise the drought culture

300.47 --> 305.63000000000005
properly

301.22 --> 307.85
she's pretty brutal right away but the a

305.63 --> 311.57
drow are like totally evil and

307.85 --> 314.66
psychopathic they like to torture people

311.57 --> 318.139
as very games of Thrones have halves has

314.66 --> 321.389
certain type of cultures that kind of

318.139 --> 326.52
have traits of the

321.389 --> 332.93
the drow maybe what is it

326.52 --> 332.93
the what are they called again

334.73 --> 344.59000000000003
those terrible should look up a map it's

341.15 --> 350.59999999999997
basically the the small kingdom think

344.59 --> 353.98999999999995
the iron Kingdom at the sea and they're

350.6 --> 355.21000000000004
like pretty grim people well it's kind

353.99 --> 358.45
of similar to elves

355.21 --> 361.01
although elves or the drow have a a

358.45 --> 367.75
specifically matriarchal structure

361.01 --> 370.7
that's very based on black widow spider

367.75 --> 374.66
nature and they literally worship a

370.7 --> 378.61
Spider Queen God it's yeah drow it's

374.66 --> 382.28000000000003
weird spider elves you could call them

378.61 --> 389.06
black hair or black skin like perfectly

382.28 --> 392.63
black with white hair it's weird but

389.06 --> 395.15
it's made its stamp on the indie culture

392.63 --> 397.7
definitely many stories in the indie

395.15 --> 403.15999999999997
half the drought within them they're

397.7 --> 405.83
very interesting to work with and people

403.16 --> 409.43
that are that extreme yeah it's a very

405.83 --> 412.64
volatile but also they are very niching

409.43 --> 414.2
they push very hard to excel so there

412.64 --> 416.15
there's always going to be strong

414.2 --> 419.93
drought characters around and that's a

416.15 --> 423.32
good challenge so alright that's how the

419.93 --> 425.57
indie works anyway enough about that for

423.32 --> 430.90999999999997
now unless people keep asking me

425.57 --> 435.44
questions about it yeah there were two

430.91 --> 436.6
videos I did finally CD I thought it was

435.44 --> 440.54
kind of weird

436.6 --> 443.21000000000004
mark Sargent debates with the

440.54 --> 447.20000000000005
astrophysicist who was a Dutch person by

443.21 --> 450.64
the way it was weird yeah that name

447.2 --> 452.65999999999997
definitely Dutch so typical it tolls I

450.64 --> 455.45
announced through the world yeah if you

452.66 --> 458.8
want to look for baller nerds that are

455.45 --> 462.22999999999996
ready to defend the ball the Netherlands

458.8 --> 463.5
percentage-wise it's insane how many of

462.23 --> 467.68
those times

463.5 --> 478.12
live here because we have an astronaut

467.68 --> 480.06
we have astronauts - yay anyway yeah it

478.12 --> 485.97
was pretty good mark Sargent did

480.06 --> 490.03000000000003
fantastic and the the the the

485.97 --> 493.69000000000005
astrophysicist was kind of typical

490.03 --> 496.0
baller but not even that bad like you

493.69 --> 499.3
had a few like rumpus red-herring

496.0 --> 501.49
moments and mark sergeant's is not

499.3 --> 505.09000000000003
punishing at all so you just let him go

501.49 --> 507.19
pretty much everywhere except sort of

505.09 --> 511.47999999999996
jokingly at some occasions like he is so

507.19 --> 514.63
focused on just being a perfectly

511.48 --> 516.5500000000001
harmless flat earther effect as

514.63 --> 519.34
effective as you can be from a harmless

516.55 --> 522.7289999999999
state and he was very persistent at it

519.34 --> 528.0400000000001
yeah I admire that definitely mark

522.729 --> 529.7800000000001
Sargent is not yeah he's a strong guy he

528.04 --> 535.5999999999999
really knows how to handle himself

529.78 --> 537.04
and yeah the astrophysicist I don't know

535.6 --> 540.4
for a baller it wasn't too bad

537.04 --> 545.23
definitely wasn't like full in debate

540.4 --> 546.85
baller level although who knows who

545.23 --> 549.04
knows what it would have happened if for

546.85 --> 552.52
example suddenly Nathan Nathan popped in

549.04 --> 554.8
and took over from work cited he the guy

552.52 --> 557.77
might have gone complete baller apeshit

554.8 --> 561.37
after all but yeah we're never gonna

557.77 --> 563.65
find out because he'd probably never do

561.37 --> 565.33
the same thing you'd never go on the

563.65 --> 571.03
debates oh my god that would be so

565.33 --> 574.83
hilarious maybe it would who knows right

571.03 --> 574.8299999999999
so what that was interesting

575.18 --> 582.17
and Owen Benjamin stream this morning I

579.16 --> 584.66
just finished watching it before I

582.17 --> 589.279
started to show and it was really cool

584.66 --> 590.779
he talked a lot things flat flat or is

589.279 --> 595.49
it like half of it was flat earth

590.779 --> 598.61
related and I know why because he seems

595.49 --> 601.69
to have contacted David Weiss from D

598.61 --> 604.37
beside rabbit holes shout out to him and

601.69 --> 606.3800000000001
they talked over Skype so I know exactly

604.37 --> 609.91
what's going to happen because David

606.38 --> 612.23
wise is just gonna do in a concentrated

609.91 --> 614.3299999999999
presentation to just lure him in because

612.23 --> 615.77
that's what David wise always does and

614.33 --> 618.89
he's gotten very good at it

615.77 --> 622.6999999999999
and I've was directly reflected in

618.89 --> 625.04
everything that in everything that Owen

622.7 --> 628.85
brought forth so yeah he's getting

625.04 --> 630.8299999999999
really now into Flat Earth it's no

628.85 --> 636.5600000000001
longer looking from a distance he's now

630.83 --> 639.0200000000001
really absorbing that layer that first

636.56 --> 641.5999999999999
Flat Earth awakening layer and very

639.02 --> 645.529
interesting to see how that's gonna sink

641.6 --> 647.2090000000001
him with him it's very good and

645.529 --> 649.3389999999999
apparently they're gonna do a live show

647.209 --> 653.529
or recorded show or something together

649.339 --> 653.5290000000001
and looking forward to that

656.9 --> 659.9
yeah

666.779 --> 673.05
so funny it's a weird thing with Owen

671.1 --> 679.0790000000001
Benjamin like he's a comedian and he's a

673.05 --> 682.4699999999999
I say how does he say a sacred cow

679.079 --> 687.42
slaughterhouses type and I kind of envy

682.47 --> 690.6
that that he literally does that as in

687.42 --> 693.0889999999999
Public Act and he's so good at it that I

690.6 --> 698.6700000000001
have serious envy for that because yeah

693.089 --> 700.7090000000001
I I'd like to do jokes I'd it's not my

698.67 --> 702.74
stuff I try to be more subtle at it I

700.709 --> 704.7299999999999
hope you guys in that taking notice I

702.74 --> 707.5790000000001
don't know I can't be funny at times

704.73 --> 711.36
especially as is as a side kick in

707.579 --> 714.0889999999999
another show I think it's just have my

711.36 --> 717.7090000000001
moments but the way he does it and

714.089 --> 720.6
sometimes I think like oh yeah I wanna

717.709 --> 723.05
I'm kind of envious and I'm open about

720.6 --> 725.6990000000001
it about about how he does it

723.05 --> 728.6099999999999
that I'm almost like yeah i'm i wanna

725.699 --> 732.649
troll you with what you do and like try

728.61 --> 735.2090000000001
to do a comedy sketch of you somehow but

732.649 --> 740.16
I don't think I can pull it off it's

735.209 --> 743.9899999999999
like I maybe I could try it out a couple

740.16 --> 749.37
of times in private not record it I

743.99 --> 752.37
don't know it's so so funny because it

749.37 --> 754.319
isn't that hard really if you I already

752.37 --> 758.25
kind of do it but I don't do it as a

754.319 --> 763.3499999999999
comedy sketch sometimes I just tried to

758.25 --> 766.68
summarize how somebody acts but if I

763.35 --> 770.16
literally act that out then that could

766.68 --> 772.7589999999999
be pretty comedic oh I don't know it's

770.16 --> 772.759
just an idea

779.579 --> 785.709
okay people are talking about something

782.139 --> 791.379
completely different berries I guess

785.709 --> 794.439
it's the season or well the main berry

791.379 --> 797.999
season is usually after it's August

794.439 --> 797.9989999999999
September and October

808.12 --> 814.0
yes strawberries strawberries is

810.37 --> 819.72
definitely it's a season for strawberry

814.0 --> 824.04
picking right now it's been good weather

819.72 --> 827.35
now thanks Anna Dean much appreciated

824.04 --> 829.9
yeah I'm satisfied with my style and I

827.35 --> 836.1700000000001
just I just tried to let it happen

829.9 --> 839.62
naturally like it happens anyway it's

836.17 --> 842.53
gonna it always does when the moment

839.62 --> 844.99
finds me it's mostly just a case of not

842.53 --> 847.18
being overly eager when I feel the

844.99 --> 855.58
energy arising not screwing it up by

847.18 --> 862.0899999999999
being too greedy you could say and but I

855.58 --> 863.6500000000001
can do sketches like the is it like the

862.09 --> 865.69
cartoon thing that's basically the same

863.65 --> 873.16
thing but in pictures in picture form

865.69 --> 877.71
and I don't know maybe I just filled

873.16 --> 877.7099999999999
with experimental at that

878.95 --> 886.46
so far my YouTube career has pretty much

882.08 --> 888.59
been completely live and natural that's

886.46 --> 892.6700000000001
really what I do that's how you all know

888.59 --> 896.1800000000001
me so maybe I shouldn't really do it

892.67 --> 900.4399999999999
just keep it to myself we'll see I don't

896.18 --> 902.63
know if it goes off because for now I'm

900.44 --> 904.6700000000001
probably going to be fixated on D&D more

902.63 --> 906.41
and more for now because a lot of things

904.67 --> 910.06
are happening still need to work on some

906.41 --> 914.89
things I got more characters and their

910.06 --> 920.6899999999999
tie-ins to everything else I gotta also

914.89 --> 925.54
work on some major events which has even

920.69 --> 927.4300000000001
been touched upon in some way by yet

925.54 --> 930.8
transcranial

927.43 --> 933.1099999999999
as in time travel

930.8 --> 935.2099999999999
things that happened way back and I need

933.11 --> 938.09
to connect everything needs to connect

935.21 --> 941.9000000000001
so it's quite a puzzle to get everything

938.09 --> 944.83
together in the entire timeframe of all

941.9 --> 944.8299999999999
things happening

950.079 --> 955.6899999999999
all right Thank You cat

952.43 --> 955.6899999999999
Robert cats apiece

958.22 --> 961.73
I already know that there's no ballers

960.829 --> 964.9699999999999
here right now

961.73 --> 969.3190000000001
they probably gonna pop on at the actual

964.97 --> 972.379
time they're there automated vault

969.319 --> 974.4699999999999
activated system is gonna make them go

972.379 --> 977.2090000000001
online and suddenly start rolling me

974.47 --> 979.1890000000001
because I have surprising little amount

977.209 --> 981.949
of down votes usually I have a huge

979.189 --> 985.99
amount of downloads or maybe not doing a

981.949 --> 992.42
show for a day broke them it's like I

985.99 --> 995.11
hope so alright look who's there yeah

992.42 --> 995.11
SMS

1001.07 --> 1008.029
all right Oh Samus it's okay if you're a

1005.449 --> 1013.12
baller angels gonna talk about berries

1008.029 --> 1013.12
and the seasons I don't mind

1018.16 --> 1026.75
talk about leb says talk about that

1022.759 --> 1031.6100000000001
video of boat ranty showed when was that

1026.75 --> 1035.75
which video of boat was that during

1031.61 --> 1038.9289999999999
their debates because I was away

1035.75 --> 1040.61
you know I only got back at 11 o'clock I

1038.929 --> 1045.41
haven't really watched any videos other

1040.61 --> 1047.99
than the mark Sargent in debate with the

1045.41 --> 1051.01
astrophysicist and Owen Benjamin this

1047.99 --> 1051.01
morning that's it

1053.35 --> 1064.03
I have space version of the indie lulz

1057.39 --> 1067.24
right well yeah there's a giant section

1064.03 --> 1070.42
of science fiction including space RPGs

1067.24 --> 1078.82
so yeah I've done Star Wars RPG pretty

1070.42 --> 1080.44
damn awesome but it requires such a you

1078.82 --> 1082.1499999999999
have to have a special talent as a game

1080.44 --> 1083.38
master to be able to do it properly you

1082.15 --> 1086.23
have to be a really good storyteller

1083.38 --> 1089.3500000000001
because if you're not if it's gonna be

1086.23 --> 1092.56
flunky then the star wars dream is gonna

1089.35 --> 1095.56
drift away in people are gonna lose

1092.56 --> 1097.6
focus and it's a very quick paced thing

1095.56 --> 1100.21
often it's literally almost like movie

1097.6 --> 1103.78
scene to movie scene and sometimes with

1100.21 --> 1109.3600000000001
specific action you have special shots

1103.78 --> 1112.17
of what people are doing so it's more

1109.36 --> 1116.34
like a movie than like a real strategy

1112.17 --> 1116.3400000000001
turn-based game like the India's

1119.44 --> 1125.559
but I've played it like a pretty

1123.37 --> 1128.9499999999998
extensive adventure even I wasn't the

1125.559 --> 1133.78
game master that the guy was a real Star

1128.95 --> 1138.3700000000001
Wars fan and he did it really well it's

1133.78 --> 1142.2
also part of the same Utrecht RPG group

1138.37 --> 1142.1999999999998
from that from the meetup site

1148.17 --> 1158.8700000000001
okay a venti fairy from okay up right

1156.36 --> 1158.87
I'll search it

1164.9 --> 1168.019
[Music]

1170.97 --> 1177.81
okay you're talking about a video from

1173.42 --> 1180.38
Mathias KP I presume that's what's

1177.81 --> 1180.3799999999999
popping up

1183.56 --> 1186.1
yeah

1191.07 --> 1202.389
all right interesting optical slant it's

1198.399 --> 1211.2299999999998
exactly optical and behavior yeah I see

1202.389 --> 1220.4799999999998
I see it oh wow that's that's condensed

1211.23 --> 1222.669
okay can I present this safely all right

1220.48 --> 1224.6490000000001
his channel is not monetized so I could

1222.669 --> 1228.669
probably do it

1224.649 --> 1234.0
I'll shadow might okay so I am going to

1228.669 --> 1239.6390000000001
show a 30 second videos from Matthias KP

1234.0 --> 1239.639
a condensed feed condensed video

1256.36 --> 1259.1699999999998
all right

1260.28 --> 1274.05
okay there it is I'm gonna do it without

1266.67 --> 1276.68
sound so well oh look look at the angle

1274.05 --> 1276.68
it's traveling

1280.64 --> 1285.2
it's getting smaller due to perspective

1282.74 --> 1289.079
while this is amazing

1285.2 --> 1289.079
[Music]

1295.6 --> 1298.26
huh

1298.32 --> 1303.47
Wow

1300.03 --> 1303.47
yeah that's impressive

1310.59 --> 1317.82
all right I wonder during what period of

1313.11 --> 1327.6
the day this was shot because looks a

1317.82 --> 1331.22
lot like the tidal bulge and there's

1327.6 --> 1333.57
likely to be little air clarity because

1331.22 --> 1335.82
Monty's been saying it there's a lot of

1333.57 --> 1338.1589999999999
spraying going on so that makes the

1335.82 --> 1340.47
visibility you've reach a lot less and

1338.159 --> 1342.8690000000001
it is pretty impressive how the whole

1340.47 --> 1345.179
thing basically did mer in on itself

1342.869 --> 1352.649
beyond the water line it really

1345.179 --> 1357.96
disappeared behind it it's impressive is

1352.649 --> 1368.2689999999998
it fake and really you think so Hanna

1357.96 --> 1368.269
Dean let me look at it again

1370.79 --> 1379.75
I'm just gonna look at the water if

1373.82 --> 1383.6789999999999
there's any change a good consistency I

1379.75 --> 1383.679
just get blurry a bit

1394.24 --> 1401.659
the wave sizes seem very consistent at

1398.87 --> 1408.049
least so there's no kind of size

1401.659 --> 1413.0800000000002
tinkering going on no I I don't see why

1408.049 --> 1413.08
this is this is not genuine really

1418.82 --> 1425.8799999999999
now in this case leb since it is filmed

1423.81 --> 1435.6599999999999
from the coast especially as the zoom

1425.88 --> 1438.21
out proved it is not to its it wouldn't

1435.66 --> 1440.3100000000002
be unlikely that it could be a literal

1438.21 --> 1442.32
obstruction in this case due to the

1440.31 --> 1446.3999999999999
tidal bulge which happens in at the

1442.32 --> 1449.22
coast as ranty demonstrated on my

1446.4 --> 1453.1100000000001
hangout two days ago the Saturday open

1449.22 --> 1456.3600000000001
panel hangout he demonstrated exact

1453.11 --> 1459.57
exactly how that water moving in is

1456.36 --> 1462.75
going to create a bulge so in this case

1459.57 --> 1464.9099999999999
well that is obstruction that's not

1462.75 --> 1467.82
concealment that's not folding into the

1464.91 --> 1470.3100000000002
mirror layer beyond the optical slant

1467.82 --> 1473.31
point this case it would be a literal

1470.31 --> 1476.48
bulge of water the entire plateau of

1473.31 --> 1479.8799999999999
water closer by would be raised up

1476.48 --> 1483.8700000000001
obscuring significant amounts of highly

1479.88 --> 1487.71
angular size reduced things in the

1483.87 --> 1490.1699999999998
distance it makes perfect sense so in

1487.71 --> 1494.33
this case I think it is obstruction it's

1490.17 --> 1494.3300000000002
very likely considering a location

1519.979 --> 1531.21
now Peter family what it tidal bulges

1525.71 --> 1534.45
it's it's during the tides mostly that's

1531.21 --> 1536.849
when it's most prevalent and as

1534.45 --> 1540.599
demonstrated that is the time where

1536.849 --> 1543.389
water gets unusually OOP

1540.599 --> 1546.389
yeah heightened at a certain location

1543.389 --> 1551.099
that creates a little bulge as the water

1546.389 --> 1553.1999999999998
moves in because of the limited amount

1551.099 --> 1555.96
of room it can maneuver in it's it's

1553.2 --> 1560.509
forced to push up and will eventually

1555.96 --> 1560.509
move off to the sides causing also waves

1561.019 --> 1568.71
but it creates a temporary obstruction

1565.589 --> 1573.33
of water a body of water that's just

1568.71 --> 1578.299
higher than the ordinary sea level and

1573.33 --> 1578.299
it's only land in words it's only where

1578.719 --> 1584.759
where the ocean is not deep because at

1583.229 --> 1588.779
the deep parts you don't have that there

1584.759 --> 1591.239
is no bulges whatsoever except the ocean

1588.779 --> 1594.419
is extremely restless and then you just

1591.239 --> 1597.21
have very large waves but there's no

1594.419 --> 1599.789
specific bulges at some places and other

1597.21 --> 1601.409
places not wherever the ocean is really

1599.789 --> 1603.889
deep it's all pretty much level in the

1601.409 --> 1603.8890000000001
deep ocean

1613.25 --> 1616.45
[Music]

1621.33 --> 1630.32
mm-hmm Oh any of you guys have an

1624.749 --> 1630.32
opinion by the way about my parents

1632.059 --> 1647.36
again was Sunday evening I got on there

1640.649 --> 1650.129
yeah Merl on Merle's what do you think I

1647.36 --> 1652.289
was pretty hyped up and I had a cup of

1650.129 --> 1656.759
coffee right before and was totally in

1652.289 --> 1659.85
my in my peak efficiency but yeah Merl

1656.759 --> 1661.879
was kind of tired out I been up all

1659.85 --> 1661.879
night

1669.52 --> 1674.1399999999999
you also told me by the way that some

1671.74 --> 1676.929
person if I remember correctly did a

1674.14 --> 1679.8090000000002
video with fragments of some things that

1676.929 --> 1682.69
I've said I still haven't had any link

1679.809 --> 1685.1789999999999
to that video if anybody knows what he

1682.69 --> 1695.6100000000001
was talking about would be nice to have

1685.179 --> 1695.6100000000001
that link in my skype so

1703.66 --> 1716.38
hmm that's interesting ranting

1713.53 --> 1719.61
I can speculate a little bit about that

1716.38 --> 1722.95
the funny thing is that salt water has

1719.61 --> 1728.02
definitely different refractive

1722.95 --> 1731.17
abilities as non c'è line water as

1728.02 --> 1738.46
freshwater and of course everything else

1731.17 --> 1740.95
that's going to be in it like rotting

1738.46 --> 1743.38
plant particles all kinds of junk is

1740.95 --> 1746.95
really in water especially flowing water

1743.38 --> 1750.19
like river water that's all gonna have a

1746.95 --> 1755.19
major effect but I think that maybe even

1750.19 --> 1763.0900000000001
with water vapor like say a very hot day

1755.19 --> 1766.6000000000001
in a extra cell line watery place maybe

1763.09 --> 1771.76
there would be in the water evaporating

1766.6 --> 1775.06
also some more remnants like salt may

1771.76 --> 1776.77
get into it like how else for example

1775.06 --> 1779.32
would you even be able to smell the sea

1776.77 --> 1781.93
if not some things are actually

1779.32 --> 1785.07
dissolved in the air with the water

1781.93 --> 1785.0700000000002
particles in the air

1792.71 --> 1800.15
maybe I'm mistaken I didn't know but I

1798.05 --> 1804.28
definitely know the distinct smell of

1800.15 --> 1807.0500000000002
the sea so maybe it is rather the

1804.28 --> 1811.07
etheric oils of the typical plants that

1807.05 --> 1813.1399999999999
are at sea and all that that yeah that

1811.07 --> 1815.78
causes the general smell of the sea the

1813.14 --> 1822.5200000000002
sea weeds and typical plants at disease

1815.78 --> 1822.52
edge dune plants

1847.19 --> 1855.56
now right I love awakening the salt is

1851.63 --> 1858.5900000000001
definitely not ECAP rating or you

1855.56 --> 1860.6299999999999
probably meant evaporating but nah

1858.59 --> 1863.05
didn't say that but what I do say is

1860.63 --> 1863.0500000000002
that

1869.26 --> 1882.49
maybe some particles do get carried into

1875.529 --> 1885.21
the air with the moist I I don't know it

1882.49 --> 1885.21
wouldn't be a lot

1886.01 --> 1896.6
but what your evaporation is it always

1890.179 --> 1898.76
pure what if water evaporated but right

1896.6 --> 1901.2199999999998
above it the air would be relative cool

1898.76 --> 1909.44
then it would immediately form a mist

1901.22 --> 1912.02
right so wouldn't there be particles be

1909.44 --> 1914.27
able to transfer because it is all

1912.02 --> 1917.66
basically solid pretty close by each

1914.27 --> 1922.78
other I don't know it's I'm just wildly

1917.66 --> 1922.78
speculating at this point overall

1928.16 --> 1936.23
right yeah I love awakening rainwater is

1931.55 --> 1938.09
distilled but it's also contains dust

1936.23 --> 1941.42
particles that's how it's able to

1938.09 --> 1948.8899999999999
actually form rain or hail that

1941.42 --> 1953.47
eventually evaporates into rain again so

1948.89 --> 1958.3300000000002
it's not all pure distilled water at all

1953.47 --> 1961.25
can contain all kinds of substances dust

1958.33 --> 1962.4499999999998
yeah some of it minerals some of it

1961.25 --> 1965.03
toxic

1962.45 --> 1967.3600000000001
all depending on whatever is going

1965.03 --> 1967.36
around

1983.76 --> 1986.76
lunch

2010.17 --> 2020.01
right well summers interesting I don't

2017.85 --> 2024.06
see why we need to presuppose two

2020.01 --> 2026.09
stationary magnetic poles on a flat

2024.06 --> 2026.09
earth

2036.5 --> 2042.37
first you need to need to know the

2038.99 --> 2046.7
nature of the geometry of the Flat Earth

2042.37 --> 2050.83
how it's actually laid out and then

2046.7 --> 2054.83
determine is there a specific target

2050.83 --> 2063.23
location from which the magnetism on the

2054.83 --> 2065.74
earth is coming or is it more Universal

2063.23 --> 2069.29
directional in a way for example

2065.74 --> 2071.6
as I suggest with the rectangular

2069.29 --> 2074.15
looping model it's rather directional

2071.6 --> 2077.06
with local fluctuations because the

2074.15 --> 2082.58
magnetic map is measured map as far as I

2077.06 --> 2085.04
know so that is real data base does seem

2082.58 --> 2089.2599999999998
there's definitely local influences or

2085.04 --> 2094.6
fluctuations so it's not a regular

2089.26 --> 2094.6000000000004
uniform magnetic field

2119.17 --> 2122.01
hmm

2124.56 --> 2129.08
all right yep

2133.66 --> 2139.17
all right well Billy was a when you

2135.79 --> 2143.62
suggest that ballers need to actually

2139.17 --> 2145.54
draw consequences from optics then

2143.62 --> 2149.67
you're presuming that they can handle

2145.54 --> 2152.5
that at all optics now they prefer their

2149.67 --> 2154.63
there are more geometrical models and

2152.5 --> 2156.55
all that all these things that that they

2154.63 --> 2160.54
can just imagine and model out and

2156.55 --> 2162.61
calculate they prefer to dabble in that

2160.54 --> 2168.1
kind of thing and not really account for

2162.61 --> 2170.52
optics at all like just don't don't deal

2168.1 --> 2170.52
with that

2172.13 --> 2175.3
[Music]

2184.89 --> 2189.989
right Samus well that's really nice but

2188.549 --> 2191.48
you don't really know what the stars are

2189.989 --> 2195.089
as far as I'm concerned they're purely

2191.48 --> 2199.799
holographic based phenomena that are at

2195.089 --> 2201.8089999999997
angular location angular positions in

2199.799 --> 2205.559
relation to the observer on the earth

2201.809 --> 2207.2690000000002
and they don't prove any geometry at all

2205.559 --> 2212.549
because they're purely holographic

2207.269 --> 2214.6499999999996
phenomena and as far as a center of a

2212.549 --> 2222.68
flat earth again you presume that there

2214.65 --> 2222.6800000000003
is a center there's no proof of that

2223.999 --> 2230.0899999999997
that's disc thinking that's disc model

2227.759 --> 2233.3
assumption

2230.09 --> 2233.3
[Music]

2242.21 --> 2246.04
Oh what kind of a question is that

2255.89 --> 2261.14
evidence from evidence for what for the

2258.71 --> 2265.18
holographic globe of the heavens no I

2261.14 --> 2268.7
base that purely on data on data that I

2265.18 --> 2272.109
have personally witnessed that I've

2268.7 --> 2275.71
tested with my intuition and Crawford

2272.109 --> 2280.96
cross-referenced it reasoned it out and

2275.71 --> 2285.289
it works and it's all data base no

2280.96 --> 2287.63
presuppositions only angle to it is that

2285.289 --> 2289.9100000000003
I assume they are holographic because I

2287.63 --> 2294.44
haven't seen anything that proves the

2289.91 --> 2295.91
contrary like approachability and I

2294.44 --> 2297.319
stated that from the start

2295.91 --> 2298.97
where's the approachability where's the

2297.319 --> 2302.749
proof you can actually approach it so

2298.97 --> 2305.269
much talk so much speculation where is

2302.749 --> 2308.5389999999998
the actual approach where do you see the

2305.269 --> 2312.2
angular size change of some of these

2308.539 --> 2317.44
discs or whatever present the evidence

2312.2 --> 2317.4399999999996
the actual scene evidence video

2322.3 --> 2329.05
what data the angular data the known

2326.58 --> 2331.9
empirical data of the globe of the

2329.05 --> 2337.21
heavens that lights our scene in a

2331.9 --> 2341.62
specific pattern consistent from the

2337.21 --> 2344.02
earth by observers if you change your

2341.62 --> 2346.6
position then the globe changes with you

2344.02 --> 2355.15
in a very specific correlation to the

2346.6 --> 2357.24
position of the earth that's it that's

2355.15 --> 2361.36
the data that is the measurable

2357.24 --> 2363.91
confirmable data because angular

2361.36 --> 2366.7000000000003
relations of the heavenly bodies the

2363.91 --> 2371.1099999999997
only thing you got you don't have any

2366.7 --> 2376.56
proof of any distance to any of it

2371.11 --> 2376.56
actual distance it's all presupposed

2381.75 --> 2387.69
parallax is all science fiction blah you

2385.71 --> 2390.38
have no confirmation that any of it is

2387.69 --> 2390.38
physical in nature

2391.07 --> 2394.219

2402.6 --> 2405.7599999999998
[Music]

2433.74 --> 2436.7999999999997
[Music]

2461.43 --> 2468.39
okay I wish you guys would actually

2465.63 --> 2470.4
start to discuss these never have these

2468.39 --> 2473.58
debates on my panel now that would be a

2470.4 --> 2475.29
lot more amusing well now it's just

2473.58 --> 2480.5699999999997
really distracting for me reading

2475.29 --> 2486.44
through all the chats and yes i'll

2480.57 --> 2486.44
yunkai it is tasty thank you for asking

2495.83 --> 2507.15
well beer can girth if that is the case

2500.4 --> 2511.79
then you've been stuck with let's just

2507.15 --> 2516.42
described it as the arrogant cocky pop

2511.79 --> 2518.2799999999997
[ __ ] nonsense of victory dick

2516.42 --> 2520.7400000000002
declaration then you apparently got

2518.28 --> 2523.86
stuck to that because you didn't really

2520.74 --> 2526.1699999999996
look into it or you saw you were free

2523.86 --> 2528.36
[ __ ] ya preset in your mind and just

2526.17 --> 2530.4
focusing on finding ridiculous stuff so

2528.36 --> 2538.4100000000003
you could dismiss the actual information

2530.4 --> 2541.9100000000003
that is found in it as well so I don't

2538.41 --> 2541.91
think you've looked hard enough

2544.14 --> 2548.3689999999997
unless you don't really want to know and

2546.089 --> 2552.0789999999997
you just want to be on the baller side

2548.369 --> 2552.079
know if you love it so much

2560.609 --> 2567.7889999999998
right soccer can't well people in

2563.799 --> 2569.98
Australia see different stars then what

2567.789 --> 2572.5
we see in Europe it's because the globe

2569.98 --> 2577.21
of the heavens or the demi-glace we see

2572.5 --> 2584.349
it is angled in another way because of

2577.21 --> 2588.369
the location on the earth it's really

2584.349 --> 2591.9900000000002
simple it's lights have a preset angular

2588.369 --> 2591.9900000000002
relation with the position of the earth

2593.789 --> 2604.3590000000004
and if you move then so does the deed my

2599.349 --> 2610.329
globe in its way it turns with latitude

2604.359 --> 2612.96
and longitude very specifically and over

2610.329 --> 2612.96
time as well

2616.43 --> 2619.489
[Music]

2669.83 --> 2676.67
[Music]

2671.56 --> 2678.56
okay well Yonko where do I think Flat

2676.67 --> 2681.56
Earth will be in five years in the

2678.56 --> 2684.59
mainstream media so I think it will

2681.56 --> 2688.46
pretty much be in the same place but I

2684.59 --> 2692.8900000000003
think that a lot of talk shows on TV are

2688.46 --> 2692.89
gonna talk about it a lot more regularly

2696.1 --> 2707.08
and who knows maybe there will be Flat

2702.68 --> 2710.47
Earth will somehow be more repeatedly

2707.08 --> 2713.48
attempted to be ridiculed through comedy

2710.47 --> 2717.58
or kid shows probably catch us they're

2713.48 --> 2717.58
gonna probably try to ridicule it more

2717.7 --> 2723.02
really make it the standard like really

2720.02 --> 2730.7599999999998
try to condition it in the counter the

2723.02 --> 2732.16
general awakening but yeah it you can't

2730.76 --> 2737.5
really stop it

2732.16 --> 2737.5
there's it it does really wake people up

2738.55 --> 2747.1400000000003
once they're yeah they can allow

2741.23 --> 2749.63
themselves to to let go of the fear and

2747.14 --> 2753.35
really see something in a new way and

2749.63 --> 2760.82
then judge for themselves and hey if you

2753.35 --> 2764.21
think if you want to be honest then yeah

2760.82 --> 2767.2400000000002
just look I really look and start to

2764.21 --> 2771.92
think from the other side in order to

2767.24 --> 2775.9399999999996
just understand it and look further and

2771.92 --> 2778.85
test it that's these things and some

2775.94 --> 2781.37
ballers have art sparingly doing this

2778.85 --> 2784.0099999999998
people like Zinder does it every now and

2781.37 --> 2787.1
then does really test it it does really

2784.01 --> 2789.98
get into the thinking as a flat earth

2787.1 --> 2792.92
your way can't really let go of the the

2789.98 --> 2795.4900000000002
giggles about it still thinks it's

2792.92 --> 2795.4900000000002
ridiculous

2800.72 --> 2808.8799999999997
but that's yeah that's pretty much the

2803.54 --> 2813.56
way to do it but it's if you genuinely

2808.88 --> 2817.31
want to undo conditioning concerning the

2813.56 --> 2819.8289999999997
ball with yourself it's very likely

2817.31 --> 2821.96
you'll have to do it by yourself and

2819.829 --> 2825.05
just first figure it out

2821.96 --> 2827.54
because if you're gonna yeah talk to

2825.05 --> 2829.76
everyone in your family and your friends

2827.54 --> 2832.75
circles that you're used to it's gonna

2829.76 --> 2837.4100000000003
create a lot of confusion and eventually

2832.75 --> 2839.119
suspicion put potentially and yeah so

2837.41 --> 2841.48
it's better to just figure it out on

2839.119 --> 2841.48
yourself

2846.77 --> 2850.99
[Music]

2848.32 --> 2852.25
and then eventually you can decide are

2850.99 --> 2856.8999999999996
you going to come out with it are you

2852.25 --> 2860.68
going to be a public flat earther video

2856.9 --> 2865.38
or whatever but that's going to have

2860.68 --> 2865.3799999999997
consequences it does it always does

2879.97 --> 2889.2999999999997
and I think it's that part the the

2882.52 --> 2891.25
social the social decline you could call

2889.3 --> 2893.5
it like you're put on a lower scale

2891.25 --> 2896.59
you're just degraded socially you're

2893.5 --> 2900.28
stigmatized publicly yeah shames the

2896.59 --> 2902.29
stigmatization stigmatization and this

2900.28 --> 2907.78
of course other layers wins the

2902.29 --> 2909.61
stigmatization also happens a lot how

2907.78 --> 2914.8
did we even call it that maybe I'm just

2909.61 --> 2917.58
using the word completely wrong making

2914.8 --> 2917.5800000000004
and look bad

2922.27 --> 2927.92
so yeah if you don't like that at all if

2925.22 --> 2930.77
you really need to be accept it then

2927.92 --> 2932.9900000000002
it's very likely that your instinct will

2930.77 --> 2934.82
just tell you like no you're not gonna

2932.99 --> 2937.16
do that even if you are really curious

2934.82 --> 2942.6200000000003
because you can't handle the

2937.16 --> 2946.85
consequences and such a response would

2942.62 --> 2950.7999999999997
be kept completely internal wouldn't be

2946.85 --> 2950.7999999999997
readable of the surface

2984.79 --> 2993.52
and look Samus things disappearing from

2990.25 --> 2998.83
the bottom up has to do with optics and

2993.52 --> 3002.73
sight it's a thing when you see that

2998.83 --> 3005.18
doesn't happen in geometry as I've said

3002.73 --> 3009.66
before I should really pick Nathan

3005.18 --> 3012.12
Nathan's here on skype about getting me

3009.66 --> 3014.8399999999997
that video where it was demonstrated on

3012.12 --> 3020.04
the debates it's probably a year ago now

3014.84 --> 3021.78
we're at a geometric drawing it's

3020.04 --> 3025.17
demonstrated a camera on the floor

3021.78 --> 3027.8700000000003
looking at a obstacle piece of wood or

3025.17 --> 3030.78
something and a specific set distance

3027.87 --> 3032.8199999999997
and exactly twice the distance another

3030.78 --> 3037.65
piece of wood exactly twice the size and

3032.82 --> 3041.04
then you draw a line from do in the in

3037.65 --> 3044.88
the drawing from the camera past blocks

3041.04 --> 3049.04
and will match up exactly well this yeah

3044.88 --> 3054.69
they literally built that even put a

3049.04 --> 3057.89
piece of string to get a literal line so

3054.69 --> 3062.76
it would geometrically line up and then

3057.89 --> 3065.37
looked through the camera and it didn't

3062.76 --> 3070.13
line up even though it lined up

3065.37 --> 3075.2599999999998
geometrically and that is optics and

3070.13 --> 3078.21
that is why geometrical fuel doesn't

3075.26 --> 3082.23
doesn't tell you how things will look at

3078.21 --> 3085.92
all because it completely lacks all

3082.23 --> 3088.29
actual elements of sites and optics this

3085.92 --> 3090.51
is a wide variety of things that apply

3088.29 --> 3095.45
that causing optical slant in the for

3090.51 --> 3095.4500000000003
distance looking over a flat surface and

3096.26 --> 3105.65
yeah just aside it's so complicated so

3099.75 --> 3105.65
much more extensive than just geometry

3107.36 --> 3113.94
that kind of sounds like flatterers for

3110.85 --> 3118.2
beginners well I got a couple of

3113.94 --> 3119.43
beginners in Chad I think Oh hold on

3118.2 --> 3125.27
hello

3119.43 --> 3126.87
peanuts good morning how are you doing

3125.27 --> 3130.82
thanks for joining

3126.87 --> 3133.8199999999997
I'm alright just got up made some coffee

3130.82 --> 3133.82
hmm

3134.66 --> 3140.2999999999997
how are you yeah I'm doing good

3140.57 --> 3148.9500000000003
pretty uneventful Easter although in the

3145.8 --> 3151.44
world not so uneventful and of course

3148.95 --> 3154.6499999999996
yeah yesterday is the second Easter day

3151.44 --> 3157.14
I don't know that even means anything

3154.65 --> 3160.8
because it's Easter Sunday and we always

3157.14 --> 3162.42
have a second Easter day after that when

3160.8 --> 3165.6600000000003
everybody's off work and everything

3162.42 --> 3168.33
people do family stuff usually and we

3165.66 --> 3173.19
had a long D in the session it was

3168.33 --> 3180.36
awesome it was really warm we had ice

3173.19 --> 3185.34
cream organic ice cream we so well what

3180.36 --> 3188.3700000000003
were you doing yes oh I'm not sure but

3185.34 --> 3191.8500000000004
it is kind of weird like how you

3188.37 --> 3195.63
associated a rabbit to eggs you know cuz

3191.85 --> 3199.37
I rabbit a rabbit doesn't lay eggs you

3195.63 --> 3203.31
know I mean it's not that strange really

3199.37 --> 3208.31
you do know where the or where I learned

3203.31 --> 3214.74
very young where that tail came from

3208.31 --> 3217.86
it's all seasonal it wasn't looking

3214.74 --> 3221.64
Easter and the tradition of finding axe

3217.86 --> 3226.38
comes from egg hunting during the spring

3221.64 --> 3229.8599999999997
season from wild birds so this is like

3226.38 --> 3234.3
hidden times when there weren't really

3229.86 --> 3237.4300000000003
well yeah when people didn't really use

3234.3 --> 3239.289
cages it just

3237.43 --> 3243.1299999999997
yet cages for chickens or anything

3239.289 --> 3246.88
probably they just looked for wild eggs

3243.13 --> 3249.4300000000003
for maybe fertility like they needed the

3246.88 --> 3251.77
extra protein for that for that time

3249.43 --> 3255.16
they were very traditional probably a

3251.77 --> 3258.52
long time ago the Eden's typing

3255.16 --> 3263.2889999999998
everything the calendar the star

3258.52 --> 3265.78
calendar and yeah hunting and I think

3263.289 --> 3268.539
that the myth of the the Easter Bunny

3265.78 --> 3273.3590000000004
was probably yeah kind of born as a

3268.539 --> 3277.869
folklore when they started finding

3273.359 --> 3282.119
certain type of eggs in abandoned rabbit

3277.869 --> 3285.28
hole burrows like at the entrance and

3282.119 --> 3288.13
then people started to make up stories

3285.28 --> 3291.369
to their kids like oh yeah see the bunny

3288.13 --> 3293.2000000000003
left some eggs and I think that if yeah

3291.369 --> 3295.059
there probably were or maybe there's

3293.2 --> 3297.1899999999996
there are a certain type of birds that

3295.059 --> 3300.1600000000003
lay their eggs in abandoned holes for

3297.19 --> 3303.13
some reason it's a the countryside type

3300.16 --> 3305.5589999999997
of bird I think so where there's not a

3303.13 --> 3312.4300000000003
lot of trees like the Netherlands for

3305.559 --> 3316.48
example real rural areas and I think

3312.43 --> 3318.97
that is how Easter was basically made as

3316.48 --> 3323.44
a just like Santa Claus made into a

3318.97 --> 3326.23
mythology from folk things from the past

3323.44 --> 3328.48
oh well with Santa Claus it's a lot more

3326.23 --> 3331.93
extreme than it's more commercially

3328.48 --> 3334.96
driven that was brought into being the

3331.93 --> 3338.41
Easter is probably lost older than then

3334.96 --> 3340.869
Santa Claus anyway that's my take on

3338.41 --> 3345.8489999999997
Easter that's how I learned it how it

3340.869 --> 3350.17
came into being Easter kind of sounds

3345.849 --> 3353.19
like the word Esther and I'm trying to

3350.17 --> 3356.17
try to see a symbolism there but I don't

3353.19 --> 3358.02
they they twist the truth on us so much

3356.17 --> 3363.7000000000003
I don't know really

3358.02 --> 3365.73
the name around Easter Easter when I say

3363.7 --> 3370.06
that word I didn't think of Easter

3365.73 --> 3375.58
Esther or East are right

3370.06 --> 3379.2999999999997
no could be why yes ah sorry on on meros

3375.58 --> 3384.61
man and I'm here what do you think you

3379.3 --> 3386.92
were I I couldn't tell if he didn't

3384.61 --> 3389.32
really like your answers or if he was

3386.92 --> 3392.71
just so tired that he couldn't really

3389.32 --> 3393.46
comprehend your answers yeah I kind of

3392.71 --> 3396.7
overdid it

3393.46 --> 3399.67
I was totally full of energy and he was

3396.7 --> 3401.5899999999997
kind of slow down tired and I was just

3399.67 --> 3407.26
like yeah [ __ ] it I'm just gonna throw

3401.59 --> 3411.9100000000003
it all hunter but I think he was a

3407.26 --> 3415.4100000000003
little overwhelmed I guess yeah that guy

3411.91 --> 3418.06
but I do I like he's a nice guy but I'm

3415.41 --> 3422.73
getting a little bit worried about his

3418.06 --> 3426.16
almost obsession with magic and

3422.73 --> 3428.17
sometimes wonder like okay that's very

3426.16 --> 3429.85
dangerous if you're like that focused on

3428.17 --> 3433.51
wanting that or wanting to know more

3429.85 --> 3437.5499999999997
that that's like a dangerous position to

3433.51 --> 3441.3700000000003
be lured in by some mischievous bastard

3437.55 --> 3445.1800000000003
will offer you [ __ ] and then yeah you'll

3441.37 --> 3450.31
get a nightmare so he has to be very

3445.18 --> 3452.41
careful in my opinion that every time I

3450.31 --> 3454.12
talk about it even like how the

3452.41 --> 3458.2799999999997
ayahuasca and out of my dark world

3454.12 --> 3468.1
patients it's mostly a lot of nightmares

3458.28 --> 3473.23
so be careful don't do it I've had some

3468.1 --> 3477.2799999999997
deep conversations with him and I don't

3473.23 --> 3480.07
know sometimes I wonder if he's uh cuz

3477.28 --> 3482.65
I've seen him I can't go off on some

3480.07 --> 3486.31
people and maybe he was had been

3482.65 --> 3489.58
drinking that day I don't know but on

3486.31 --> 3493.29
angry fits you mean yeah oh he did after

3489.58 --> 3497.44
after the interview I was like okay

3493.29 --> 3499.3
started really getting really angry at

3497.44 --> 3499.81
people in chat as [ __ ] or something

3499.3 --> 3505.3
like

3499.81 --> 3509.77
cursing and I was like okay well if he

3505.3 --> 3513.4900000000002
wants to do that it's a bit borderline

3509.77 --> 3515.56
ish my opinion to do that so it's weird

3513.49 --> 3520.5699999999997
he's all over the place very hyperactive

3515.56 --> 3524.71
seemingly with art and I don't know to

3520.57 --> 3528.2200000000003
each other so uh for for a lot of I

3524.71 --> 3529.84
guess new people that are coming to this

3528.22 --> 3534.1299999999997
topic

3529.84 --> 3537.1600000000003
I try to take the mindset of I look at

3534.13 --> 3541.86
many different sources and I try to use

3537.16 --> 3544.8399999999997
my own discernment yeah mm-hmm and so I

3541.86 --> 3548.3700000000003
know this people have talked about this

3544.84 --> 3551.8
before but I would like to ask you about

3548.37 --> 3553.7799999999997
the either right I'm at in Chrome's

3551.8 --> 3556.8100000000004
better okay I'm gonna crossroads right

3553.78 --> 3562.8900000000003
now and and with the ether what exactly

3556.81 --> 3565.0299999999997
do you mean because to be more specific

3562.89 --> 3567.94
well I mean I don't know what the [ __ ]

3565.03 --> 3572.9500000000003
of photon is I mean I don't know but the

3567.94 --> 3577.93
presumed light stabilizing force or

3572.95 --> 3583.24
influencing effect right I just I just

3577.93 --> 3586.71
like it's someone who a flat earther

3583.24 --> 3590.68
that accepts there is an either right

3586.71 --> 3592.7200000000003
how did they verify that right they base

3590.68 --> 3596.83
it on the presupposition that Eliza has

3592.72 --> 3598.93
a speed it's very simple and I denounce

3596.83 --> 3603.16
that I say it's not true a light is

3598.93 --> 3608.41
instant but they speculate almost like

3603.16 --> 3612.43
another type of reversed spectroscopy

3608.41 --> 3616.21
like thing they presume that if light

3612.43 --> 3618.49
slows down it'll become like lower on

3616.21 --> 3621.87
the spectrum of color but I don't think

3618.49 --> 3625.33
that's actually really happening it's

3621.87 --> 3628.02
it's still instantaneous it just goes in

3625.33 --> 3628.02
another frequency

3628.88 --> 3636.1400000000003
so I've just noticed you know take

3632.63 --> 3638.69
someone that looks at many you know many

3636.14 --> 3641.39
different debates or watches many

3638.69 --> 3643.309
different podcasts you'll find there's

3641.39 --> 3646.1299999999997
some flat earthers except that there's

3643.309 --> 3653.4790000000003
an ether and some like say there's not

3646.13 --> 3657.4700000000003
right or they say they don't know and if

3653.479 --> 3660.319
there is something to this man named

3657.47 --> 3664.5389999999998
Tesla if if this man really existed

3660.319 --> 3670.46
right and whatever his work was doing

3664.539 --> 3674.7990000000004
was taken and put on the top shelf right

3670.46 --> 3674.799
away from the public if all that is true

3675.039 --> 3684.65
that makes more sense to me about lying

3679.749 --> 3688.6699999999996
about where we are then lying about

3684.65 --> 3690.9500000000003
there being a creator right because I'm

3688.67 --> 3694.369
almost starting to think that there's

3690.95 --> 3698.8689999999997
like a PSYOP going on here whether I

3694.369 --> 3701.359
can't just okay so if you if you look at

3698.869 --> 3704.69
a lot of flattering videos that the ones

3701.359 --> 3708.68
that get millions of views mm-hmm are

3704.69 --> 3710.839
the ones that are basically putting out

3708.68 --> 3712.6699999999996
a statement saying you know they're

3710.839 --> 3717.14
hiding going to grow the greatest lie

3712.67 --> 3719.42
ever like that type of topic right right

3717.14 --> 3722.269
and I'm starting to think that there's

3719.42 --> 3725.359
there's a PSYOP in this right wouldn't

3722.269 --> 3727.3689999999997
even good Eminem's this a EMAP

3725.359 --> 3730.369
Christians are literally under attack

3727.369 --> 3731.989
that's also kind of being denied even

3730.369 --> 3735.549
though they literally do it in plain

3731.989 --> 3738.979
sight but yeah any group could have a an

3735.549 --> 3740.63
idea like okay if we just focus on the

3738.979 --> 3743.7189999999996
Flat Earth there's been Christians then

3740.63 --> 3745.67
they may become targets too that's what

3743.719 --> 3748.21
they're kind of hoping it's all about

3745.67 --> 3750.2290000000003
political targeting and just flagging

3748.21 --> 3752.42
hoarding assert a group of people

3750.229 --> 3756.589
together to become targets of one

3752.42 --> 3760.32
specific group so maybe that's why why

3756.589 --> 3764.62
that's being done over focusing on

3760.32 --> 3766.54
on the Christian part of Flat Earth out

3764.62 --> 3768.5499999999997
there I don't know I don't really care

3766.54 --> 3770.5
it all depends on how you conduct

3768.55 --> 3772.9
yourself I followed the path of Christ

3770.5 --> 3777.01
I will never start to censor myself

3772.9 --> 3780.2200000000003
about that but I'm also very aware and

3777.01 --> 3783.07
open that it's not traditional biblical

3780.22 --> 3785.4399999999996
christianism as it were it's not

3783.07 --> 3789.88
following a religion it's really a

3785.44 --> 3794.35
personal principle thing based on

3789.88 --> 3797.05
Christ's life and conduct oh and I know

3794.35 --> 3799.0299999999997
that that's I know that that's your way

3797.05 --> 3800.53
but I I really don't want to talk about

3799.03 --> 3806.3700000000003
curse right

3800.53 --> 3812.9500000000003
I know it's your show but I don't know I

3806.37 --> 3813.58
just I'm so I just don't like religion

3812.95 --> 3815.47
man

3813.58 --> 3819.25
ever since I've let go of religion it

3815.47 --> 3822.52
felt like a bird flying off the cage and

3819.25 --> 3826.87
I just I think religion is one big

3822.52 --> 3828.64
problem on this plane I don't know I

3826.87 --> 3831.69
don't think so

3828.64 --> 3837.31
I think the problem is the people that

3831.69 --> 3839.5
abuse it yeah and the problem also with

3837.31 --> 3844.66
many religions is that people go to it's

3839.5 --> 3847.66
very open and naive very trusting so

3844.66 --> 3849.8799999999997
that makes them even more viable for

3847.66 --> 3852.1299999999997
abusers to also want to get in there

3849.88 --> 3858.1800000000003
that's a bit of a problem but it's a

3852.13 --> 3862.51
pragmatic social problem rather than

3858.18 --> 3864.6299999999997
just a general thing about religions

3862.51 --> 3868.96
because if there is proper leadership

3864.63 --> 3872.76
real leadership and real power then

3868.96 --> 3872.76
those things can be avoided

3874.319 --> 3880.119
with more yeah I waited with theocracy

3877.539 --> 3882.13
basically although yeah it can be

3880.119 --> 3886.569
corrupt to become totally corrupted by

3882.13 --> 3889.15
itself can always happen but I don't

3886.569 --> 3892.029
know it's just how religions are now in

3889.15 --> 3898.779
this world the state they are it's a

3892.029 --> 3901.559
mess and corporatism and financial ISM

3898.779 --> 3904.779
is and that way of thinking is that

3901.559 --> 3907.63
sociopathy that comes with it is taking

3904.779 --> 3911.13
over spirituality it's like taking the

3907.63 --> 3915.2200000000003
lead in what is becoming prioritized

3911.13 --> 3918.4
what yeah what power focuses on and

3915.22 --> 3920.1699999999996
that's a big problem and it reflects on

3918.4 --> 3922.569
everything because everything wants to

3920.17 --> 3925.9
stay afloat and so many people then try

3922.569 --> 3927.91
to adopt to in order to just keep on

3925.9 --> 3931.21
going we're doing whatever they want to

3927.91 --> 3935.44
do and they become gradually corrupted

3931.21 --> 3938.91
by it and that's just that's now how

3935.44 --> 3943.109
everything is arranged to the function I

3938.91 --> 3945.7889999999998
just keep I keep wondering like you know

3943.109 --> 3949.45
ever since I came to this topic I never

3945.789 --> 3952.96
since I realized that I don't live on a

3949.45 --> 3957.24
spinning ball there has to be something

3952.96 --> 3962.44
more than just hiding a creator right

3957.24 --> 3964.18
there if I could however it's done I

3962.44 --> 3968.98
don't know if I could create my own

3964.18 --> 3974.74
energy that takes all the power away

3968.98 --> 3979.44
from any authority over me yeah yeah I

3974.74 --> 3982.839
know that may sound silly but without

3979.44 --> 3989.099
power companies without electrical grids

3982.839 --> 3992.14
and all that there's there's no way that

3989.099 --> 3996.869
you could have authority over me I could

3992.14 --> 3999.4
just create it in my own backyard yeah

3996.869 --> 4003.299
there has to be something more of this I

3999.4 --> 4005.279
I didn't become a flat earther just to

4003.299 --> 4007.859
walk around thinking the earth is flat

4005.279 --> 4012.269
wondering if there's a god to still be

4007.859 --> 4015.23
under a [ __ ] authority of a

4012.269 --> 4018.6299999999997
government that plays sy outs of my mind

4015.23 --> 4022.319
yeah it's asking something like there's

4018.63 --> 4025.0190000000002
a flat earth is a a chunk in the

4022.319 --> 4027.42
awakening and the awakening is supposed

4025.019 --> 4030.9599999999996
to be pretty much everyone including the

4027.42 --> 4033.989
base Lords of people that's the issue

4030.96 --> 4035.809
that's really the long-term it's

4033.989 --> 4038.67
supposed to be a complete flip around

4035.809 --> 4041.9700000000003
and you need the total masses for them

4038.67 --> 4045.48
so we need to somehow get them out step

4041.97 --> 4047.819
by step gradually narrative level by

4045.48 --> 4052.259
narrative level as it were every level

4047.819 --> 4056.279
of awakening get them out of the trash

4052.259 --> 4059.759
heap to become awakened and fully

4056.279 --> 4064.41
potential and then defend against all

4059.759 --> 4068.5190000000002
these attacks from from the rulers and

4064.41 --> 4070.44
their systems so Flat Earth is just one

4068.519 --> 4073.68
big part the central part in the

4070.44 --> 4076.049
hourglass well since since you've you've

4073.68 --> 4079.89
been in this topic longer than I have so

4076.049 --> 4082.65
I'd like to ask you do you see a

4079.89 --> 4086.069
progression in the last four years on

4082.65 --> 4089.759
anything oh yeah John you do good you

4086.069 --> 4092.489
love me okay so tell me tell me one

4089.759 --> 4096.65
thing that has progressed that has

4092.489 --> 4100.049
helped that has helped tell me one thing

4096.65 --> 4102.15
well there's many things that happen

4100.049 --> 4104.25
let's just give me like this is this is

4102.15 --> 4107.099999999999
a direct there's ourselves that the the

4104.25 --> 4110.299
technical researchers we figured out a

4107.1 --> 4114.06
lot figured out all kinds of new

4110.299 --> 4116.85
insights and knowledge and got mistakes

4114.06 --> 4118.77
out of the way went through a giant

4116.85 --> 4121.35
process of growth and we have so much

4118.77 --> 4125.819
more insight now and also more knowledge

4121.35 --> 4128.46
of even regions of thinking it's more

4125.819 --> 4131.4890000000005
well defined the different approaches

4128.46 --> 4134.19
you can have with language and technical

4131.489 --> 4137.6089999999995
expertise in all that it's we've all

4134.19 --> 4141.159
become more adjusted to the real expert

4137.609 --> 4142.929
world because we've learned so much

4141.159 --> 4147.19
that's what hit people in university

4142.929 --> 4149.17
years to do get confronted with all the

4147.19 --> 4152.469
real dealings that are going on and the

4149.17 --> 4154.2390000000005
very serious nitty-gritty debates where

4152.469 --> 4155.9800000000005
the sense where there's no general

4154.239 --> 4157.659
narrative anymore but where there's real

4155.98 --> 4159.6089999999995
discussion that's what we've been doing

4157.659 --> 4163.48
we've been progressing great on the

4159.609 --> 4165.52
other hand we've the entire narrative

4163.48 --> 4169.9
surrounding Flat Earth has moved

4165.52 --> 4175.120000000001
gradually in this mainstream and the

4169.9 --> 4178.388999999999
alternative media's and it's even

4175.12 --> 4181.69
popping up as mentioned in some

4178.389 --> 4184.6
mainstream sources here and there so

4181.69 --> 4191.65
lots of progression even in media lands

4184.6 --> 4194.650000000001
and what else man as we've all figured

4191.65 --> 4197.08
out even NASA themselves the planners

4194.65 --> 4200.23
the designers for the mechanism for the

4197.08 --> 4203.08
machinations have taken note of the Flat

4200.23 --> 4207.61
Earth community and they're figuring is

4203.08 --> 4211.21
out and adapted Google did curvature

4207.61 --> 4213.67
calculator makers did they've tried so

4211.21 --> 4217.81
much and they've progressed they're

4213.67 --> 4220.77
delusional narrative and yeah we could

4217.81 --> 4224.409000000001
still got them tied up in certain places

4220.77 --> 4228.4890000000005
but nASA has adapted the narrative based

4224.409 --> 4231.159
on on our critical insights and views in

4228.489 --> 4233.83
our criticisms and there are certainly

4231.159 --> 4236.199
progressing things sort of like they

4233.83 --> 4238.84
were trying to maneuver again into the

4236.199 --> 4241.178999999999
future instead of just letting it all be

4238.84 --> 4244.59
as it is and just fool around

4241.179 --> 4250.0
so yeah progression a lot of it

4244.59 --> 4251.219
absolutely has heard now a flat earth

4250.0 --> 4254.11
one way or the other

4251.219 --> 4259.05
it sounds like you're you're you're

4254.11 --> 4262.839999999999
describing a awareness in the mind right

4259.05 --> 4265.900000000001
alright that's okay so I mean it's it's

4262.84 --> 4269.05
moving away from obscurity where it used

4265.9 --> 4270.37
to be remember ten years ago when when

4269.05 --> 4274.59
you said flattered if people would be

4270.37 --> 4277.78
like wait what what did you say

4274.59 --> 4280.42
now it's like oh that arathor or like oh

4277.78 --> 4285.599999999999
oh you're into that no people have heard

4280.42 --> 4287.77
about flat earth it's big difference I

4285.6 --> 4291.370000000001
kind of sneaked in there

4287.77 --> 4291.9400000000005
what's it happened people all heard

4291.37 --> 4296.38
about it

4291.94 --> 4299.11
one way or the other maybe maybe I'm

4296.38 --> 4303.43
just expecting too much you know maybe

4299.11 --> 4305.259999999999
I'm it's just a start hearing everybody

4303.43 --> 4308.950000000001
having heard about it it's just a start

4305.26 --> 4311.08
now it just needs to sink in that can

4308.95 --> 4313.03
take a long time especially if people

4311.08 --> 4314.97
are preoccupied with things not directly

4313.03 --> 4320.349999999999
related with that

4314.97 --> 4328.4400000000005
so it'll happen eventually there's no

4320.35 --> 4331.63
doubt what people will become even more

4328.44 --> 4334.36
like yeah it's so fine you know okay

4331.63 --> 4339.4800000000005
it's probably fake but I don't really

4334.36 --> 4342.25
care I guess not probably fled or or

4339.48 --> 4344.29
maybe it is a globe who knows maybe

4342.25 --> 4345.61
they're gonna a big swath of people are

4344.29 --> 4348.43
gonna be like that and it's like oh yeah

4345.61 --> 4353.08
that's all fine with me so there's all

4348.43 --> 4356.97
my stories and yeah yet you know it

4353.08 --> 4359.26
could turn out to become like that I

4356.97 --> 4362.08
just keep feeling like there's something

4359.26 --> 4365.26
more here it's right under our noses

4362.08 --> 4369.19
what do you mean what there's I don't

4365.26 --> 4371.38
know it just it almost seems like it's

4369.19 --> 4376.419999999999
almost like they don't care if we if we

4371.38 --> 4378.04
know it's quiet right and it's there has

4376.42 --> 4380.29
to be something it's what the Masters

4378.04 --> 4384.67
are discovering the truth it's about how

4380.29 --> 4388.06
to hide it in people how to make design

4384.67 --> 4391.56
culture in a way that people will start

4388.06 --> 4394.870000000001
to hide the truth from themselves

4391.56 --> 4397.68
conditioned within the culture that's

4394.87 --> 4397.68
what it's about

4398.93 --> 4403.650000000001
they knew that you if you're really

4401.85 --> 4406.200000000001
open-minded and you can break the

4403.65 --> 4408.36
conditioning there's no way to conceal

4406.2 --> 4411.45
the truth for people that are truly

4408.36 --> 4414.87
critically analyzing things they knew

4411.45 --> 4418.11
that that's why they focus so much on

4414.87 --> 4421.59
the mind control and on the religion and

4418.11 --> 4423.24
on how to make people conceal the truth

4421.59 --> 4426.02
from themselves so they don't break out

4423.24 --> 4431.45
of the spell that's what their focus is

4426.02 --> 4431.450000000001
it's always been that that's their art I

4432.35 --> 4440.1
should keep feeling guilty why cuz I'm

4435.6 --> 4444.75
because I'm and I go to work every day

4440.1 --> 4449.43
right and then I make this money that

4444.75 --> 4451.11
I'm told has value right and of course I

4449.43 --> 4456.96
provide a home for my family and all

4451.11 --> 4459.48
that and I just feel like I'm not doing

4456.96 --> 4462.15
anything with this knowledge I feel like

4459.48 --> 4464.28
I'm just well should you be doing

4462.15 --> 4465.179999999999
something with it that's why I feel

4464.28 --> 4468.33
guilty anymore

4465.18 --> 4470.04
I don't know why why why didn't why did

4468.33 --> 4472.0199999999995
I come to this knowledge why do you feel

4470.04 --> 4474.83
guilty for not knowing if you should be

4472.02 --> 4477.81
doing something with the knowledge

4474.83 --> 4480.69
that's because I'm not I'm not doing

4477.81 --> 4483.72
anything to benefit anyone's life around

4480.69 --> 4488.339999999999
me aren't you besides besides smiling

4483.72 --> 4491.780000000001
Adam and saying hey you know I mean well

4488.34 --> 4493.8
isn't that doing something already

4491.78 --> 4495.929999999999
you couldn't just be somebody that

4493.8 --> 4499.62
doesn't give a [ __ ] and ignore people or

4495.93 --> 4501.42
just use them to if you feel bad to just

4499.62 --> 4503.7
[ __ ] all over them you know you could be

4501.42 --> 4505.65
doing that so I think that just trying

4503.7 --> 4507.72
to be nice and polite and act towards

4505.65 --> 4508.3099999999995
others at you as you would have them act

4507.72 --> 4511.83
towards you

4508.31 --> 4516.21
it's a pretty decent thing to do right

4511.83 --> 4519.93
like like the other day man like I felt

4516.21 --> 4522.51
so [ __ ] helpless right my please my

4519.93 --> 4525.39
child he's my childhood cut down on the

4522.51 --> 4528.570000000001
FS Oh forgive me I felt helpless

4525.39 --> 4531.3
because I work a full-time job so

4528.57 --> 4533.82
obviously I can't hold in school

4531.3 --> 4537.38
child right so the school that he's

4533.82 --> 4544.29
going to obviously won't let him attend

4537.38 --> 4548.849
until he's vaccinated no Jesus so I'm in

4544.29 --> 4552.0
tears because I have to let my son get

4548.849 --> 4554.34
that chemical you know it's like I felt

4552.0 --> 4557.07
so helpless you know

4554.34 --> 4560.159000000001
it has nothing I could do about it well

4557.07 --> 4562.889
you can do something to do damage

4560.159 --> 4566.339999999999
prevention a lot of it actually look at

4562.889 --> 4569.51
it look it up at the natural news site

4566.34 --> 4573.0
there's a yeah measures you can take

4569.51 --> 4574.860000000001
specific supplements to prevent any

4573.0 --> 4576.989
damage from happening by giving

4574.86 --> 4580.639
everything your body needs basically for

4576.989 --> 4584.82
the emergency of certain toxic invasion

4580.639 --> 4587.67
so look into that before you actually

4584.82 --> 4590.28
get it done and also know what exactly

4587.67 --> 4594.659
is gonna be injected with the the

4590.28 --> 4601.699
literal chemicals like is there it was

4594.659 --> 4605.94
I'm aerosol in there or yep it was the

4601.699 --> 4611.058999999999
it was the powerless feeling that I had

4605.94 --> 4613.11
of it reminded me of being a slave I

4611.059 --> 4616.2300000000005
felt like I didn't have a choice

4613.11 --> 4618.15
and that's what I'm talking about that

4616.23 --> 4621.419999999999
it's like it's criminal

4618.15 --> 4626.129999999999
you can't force kids to go to school

4621.42 --> 4628.2300000000005
under punishment and then forced like

4626.13 --> 4630.059
yeah but at the same time that also

4628.23 --> 4634.829
means that they must become vaccinated

4630.059 --> 4640.79
that is yeah that's that's actually

4634.829 --> 4645.38
illegal I didn't have a choice Harlem

4640.79 --> 4648.38
I would have taken the needle forward if

4645.38 --> 4658.88
I could just to keep it out of his boner

4648.38 --> 4660.32
man it's I don't know man I I'm just

4658.88 --> 4664.16
maybe I'm just kind of going through

4660.32 --> 4667.82
something right now because I don't know

4664.16 --> 4669.95
what to do with all this man like well

4667.82 --> 4673.73
why didn't I become aware to this what

4669.95 --> 4675.65
what is my what are yes sir you're

4673.73 --> 4678.549999999999
gagging for the blue pill just because

4675.65 --> 4682.129999999999
your knowledge gives you stress come on

4678.55 --> 4684.71
what is this don't know not really I

4682.13 --> 4687.32
just I just well I want to know what I

4684.71 --> 4690.89
do with it I wanna know where where is

4687.32 --> 4693.17
my piece of the puzzle where am I you

4690.89 --> 4695.4800000000005
understand things about it so that means

4693.17 --> 4700.16
that you can see also what you can do

4695.48 --> 4704.0
about it I just explained to you what

4700.16 --> 4706.5199999999995
you can do to prep your son up for when

4704.0 --> 4708.68
he has to get vaccinated do it right so

4706.52 --> 4710.450000000001
that there's the biggest chance you

4708.68 --> 4715.280000000001
won't have any kind of residual damage

4710.45 --> 4719.3
or an effect from it at all but you

4715.28 --> 4720.94
gotta look into that gotta study it be

4719.3 --> 4724.64
very serious about it

4720.94 --> 4726.5599999999995
or XP or if you just really don't want

4724.64 --> 4729.92
it to happen you gotta see if you can

4726.56 --> 4732.68
somehow manage to keep him out of that

4729.92 --> 4737.09
school and figure it out from there on

4732.68 --> 4741.5
and if need be you sue the state for

4737.09 --> 4745.46
basically yeah forcing your kid fiafia

4741.5 --> 4747.71
to become vaccinated or or act illegally

4745.46 --> 4751.03
that is just outrageous I don't know

4747.71 --> 4751.03
maybe you could do something about it

4753.329 --> 4760.63
it's just a sad world we live in it

4758.829 --> 4764.099
could be some worry about it

4760.63 --> 4770.159000000001
rights are not rights unless you fight

4764.099 --> 4775.42
now right without a fight this is blight

4770.159 --> 4779.879999999999
all right I don't know man I'm just

4775.42 --> 4787.65
trying to find my way you know

4779.88 --> 4795.88
it's I've had a difficult year but

4787.65 --> 4797.53
really have but I mean I'm happy you

4795.88 --> 4799.619
know it's not like I'm like depressed or

4797.53 --> 4799.619
anything

4800.489 --> 4805.388999999999
well yeah you have been pressured by

4803.679 --> 4810.04
certain things do you've come on before

4805.389 --> 4815.619
but I get the feeling that some things

4810.04 --> 4817.3
just pull you down unusual amounts okay

4815.619 --> 4820.179
because things aren't going pretty well

4817.3 --> 4823.75
so I wonder why are you being pulled

4820.179 --> 4825.159
down like that what is why why are you

4823.75 --> 4833.469
doing that why are you letting that

4825.159 --> 4837.28
happen to you do you know like I said I

4833.469 --> 4839.7390000000005
guess I feel I felt guilty that I'm I

4837.28 --> 4842.079
guess I'm not I'm not doing anything

4839.739 --> 4844.888999999999
with this right I'm just why are you

4842.079 --> 4844.889
keep saying that

4845.46 --> 4852.34
you are doing something about it right

4849.239 --> 4854.409
you are good or are you just gonna let

4852.34 --> 4856.4490000000005
him get vaccinated then just click act

4854.409 --> 4859.9
like nothing's happening and do nothing

4856.449 --> 4861.339999999999
no I'm talking about in general no not

4859.9 --> 4863.67
just the shot and talked about in

4861.34 --> 4868.2390000000005
general there's nothing you can do

4863.67 --> 4870.969
there's barely anyone can do except do

4868.239 --> 4874.388999999999
it right for yourself and see whatever

4870.969 --> 4877.719
the possibility is at the time and see

4874.389 --> 4882.1900000000005
how far you dare to go and risk your

4877.719 --> 4885.65
situation - yeah -

4882.19 --> 4887.629999999999
ensure your principles all right and

4885.65 --> 4890.0
that's just how it is that's the only

4887.63 --> 4894.28
way we can really do it until things

4890.0 --> 4896.63
just get so obviously out of hand that

4894.28 --> 4898.73
resistance will naturally occur in

4896.63 --> 4902.33
groups just all become uniform grouped

4898.73 --> 4907.509999999999
up against the the extreme perpetrators

4902.33 --> 4910.28
and we'll see when it comes to that but

4907.51 --> 4914.33
you just got to do it right for yourself

4910.28 --> 4919.009999999999
and then stop punishing yourself for not

4914.33 --> 4922.01
doing more because that distracts you

4919.01 --> 4925.1
from opportunities where you could

4922.01 --> 4931.400000000001
actually use the moment to just sharpen

4925.1 --> 4935.06
your senses sharpen your oversight it

4931.4 --> 4937.489
degrades your self-insurance feelings

4935.06 --> 4939.68
and that is very important here self

4937.489 --> 4942.29
insurance is like a momentum it is an

4939.68 --> 4944.4490000000005
energy you build up and every time you

4942.29 --> 4947.48
get depressed you give into our Iman

4944.449 --> 4950.839999999999
that's you throw away your energy for

4947.48 --> 4954.62
whatever reason cuts seem really true or

4950.84 --> 4956.75
romantic or that's how you supposed to

4954.62 --> 4959.09
do it in your mind for some reason

4956.75 --> 4961.01
echoing back into the past but it's

4959.09 --> 4962.84
literally throwing your energy away to

4961.01 --> 4966.16
ahriman that makes you less and you

4962.84 --> 4969.8
could all use all that energy to instead

4966.16 --> 4976.5199999999995
grow grow your spirit becomes stronger

4969.8 --> 4979.1900000000005
become more solid become sharper so I

4976.52 --> 4982.7300000000005
definitely recommend to just move away

4979.19 --> 4985.61
from letting yourself tumble down from

4982.73 --> 4987.049999999999
four guilt of of something you literally

4985.61 --> 4989.42
cannot do anything about

4987.05 --> 4993.1990000000005
unless you've been hiding from us all

4989.42 --> 4994.16
that you are actually like some cousin

4993.199 --> 4996.71
twice removed

4994.16 --> 4999.65
Rothschild billionaire that's kind of

4996.71 --> 5001.87
scared to apply his money to completely

4999.65 --> 5006.129999999999
change everything around but I don't

5001.87 --> 5008.41
think that's the case right right so

5006.13 --> 5009.9400000000005
what are you worrying about why are you

5008.41 --> 5011.469
punishing yourself for something you

5009.94 --> 5013.469
literally cannot do anything about

5011.469 --> 5016.479
that's pure folders

5013.469 --> 5019.419
you should punish yourself for punishing

5016.479 --> 5021.459
yourself like that but in a way that you

5019.419 --> 5024.76
don't end up actually punishing yourself

5021.459 --> 5028.26
so just punish that behavior and not you

5024.76 --> 5032.820000000001
as a person don't let yourself be

5028.26 --> 5035.969
mentally ending up whipped in a corner

5032.82 --> 5039.759999999999
spiritually that's not where you belong

5035.969 --> 5044.249
do you get it yeah maybe I needed to

5039.76 --> 5046.959
hear that you know I mean good

5044.249 --> 5050.949
remembering yeah I'll think about it

5046.959 --> 5057.309
today while my slave job frankly well

5050.949 --> 5058.898999999999
now that is what it is of course I just

5057.309 --> 5061.4490000000005
think it could be so much better man

5058.899 --> 5065.169000000001
like there's so much potential here on

5061.449 --> 5067.959
this earth and I just I guess I see a

5065.169 --> 5068.349
little piece of it I see what it could

5067.959 --> 5072.489
be

5068.349 --> 5074.919
and then I and then I see how we are and

5072.489 --> 5077.348999999999
I just well what we want to learn what

5074.919 --> 5080.499
do you see in the world that you're

5077.349 --> 5082.689
staring at that you think you could

5080.499 --> 5086.26
potentially at some point do something

5082.689 --> 5089.409000000001
about and how would you do it as a few

5086.26 --> 5091.329000000001
steps away from where you are see if you

5089.409 --> 5094.089999999999
really want to change something that is

5091.329 --> 5096.28
how you do it you can't just do it

5094.09 --> 5097.899
instantly you always it takes time and

5096.28 --> 5101.018999999999
you have to get there you have to be

5097.899 --> 5102.999000000001
able to get there somehow and prevent

5101.019 --> 5105.729
yourself from being seduced from giving

5102.999 --> 5108.849
up or subtly spending your money away in

5105.729 --> 5111.179
some manic fit that you've saved up for

5108.849 --> 5113.709
that specific plan you know all that

5111.179 --> 5115.4490000000005
it's it will always be a challenge but

5113.709 --> 5119.349
you need to plan ahead if you really

5115.449 --> 5123.28
want to change something that you think

5119.349 --> 5128.229
would make a difference then think it up

5123.28 --> 5130.478999999999
think about it what could you do that

5128.229 --> 5132.929
would move towards how you want the

5130.479 --> 5132.929
world to change

5134.19 --> 5142.66
right yeah just I just look like the

5140.2 --> 5146.5599999999995
other day I was I was in a grocery store

5142.66 --> 5149.13
and I just I paid for everything and I

5146.56 --> 5152.26
just kind of sat there on a bench and I

5149.13 --> 5154.24
was I wasn't being weird about it but I

5152.26 --> 5158.79
was just like watching the people come

5154.24 --> 5162.34
in and at least out of a hundred people

5158.79 --> 5165.9
only one person walked in the store

5162.34 --> 5168.49
smollett everyone had the miserable face

5165.9 --> 5169.9
you know they had this miserable look on

5168.49 --> 5172.389999999999
their face and everyone just looks

5169.9 --> 5173.879999999999
miserable again okay everybody walked I

5172.39 --> 5177.88
walked into a store I looked miserable

5173.88 --> 5180.18
yeah except one person yeah one person

5177.88 --> 5184.87
walked in smiling and that was you know

5180.18 --> 5188.14
someone else you were looking terrible

5184.87 --> 5190.21
as well or no I was just neutral I was

5188.14 --> 5191.38
just kind of just people watching you

5190.21 --> 5193.93
know cuz I've just I've been thinking

5191.38 --> 5195.58
about this a lot and I'm just I've been

5193.93 --> 5197.9800000000005
I've been really aware of my

5195.58 --> 5201.85
surroundings and and how people are

5197.98 --> 5205.0199999999995
acting around me right and I see that

5201.85 --> 5207.55
we're all individualized and we're all

5205.02 --> 5212.14
hanging from strings from dignity

5207.55 --> 5215.9800000000005
government and relying on an authority

5212.14 --> 5218.26
you know and and financial structures

5215.98 --> 5224.2
and other guys that come with that I

5218.26 --> 5225.67
just I see a piece of how beautiful I

5224.2 --> 5231.25
could be on this plane

5225.67 --> 5233.89
if we all if we all came for ourselves

5231.25 --> 5239.749
and we all helped the man to our right

5233.89 --> 5242.179
you know all right

5239.749 --> 5245.84
I just kind of see it differently than

5242.179 --> 5248.6900000000005
other people it's cuz I've had I've had

5245.84 --> 5252.17
