3.959 --> 9.179

7.259 --> 11.940000000000001
yeah internet just

9.179 --> 14.84
got caught off

11.94 --> 14.84
out of nowhere

15.599 --> 18.56
it's really weird

20.76 --> 24.5
no idea why that happened

25.019 --> 29.939
wasn't my internet connection like

27.72 --> 32.46
YouTube there's something happen within

29.939 --> 33.78
YouTube it stalled and then it just shut

32.46 --> 36.54
the stream down

33.78 --> 40.86
it said oh OBS had trouble but OBS was

36.54 --> 42.54
all green so something weird happened

40.86 --> 46.219
I don't know what the hell that was

42.54 --> 46.219
anyway I'm back

50.1 --> 53.82
right make sure to let the others know

52.02 --> 57.719
in the old chat

53.82 --> 60.36
and then like link up the

57.719 --> 62.34
the new video in the old chat

60.36 --> 65.66
so everybody finds their way here ah

62.34 --> 65.66
right there you go

68.159 --> 72.02000000000001
cannot read previous messages

72.06 --> 74.659
what

75.78 --> 83.58
no no tarot it's not

79.74 --> 85.08
it it does it's another cat I have like

83.58 --> 88.619
every stream

85.08 --> 90.9
has its jet as soon as the other stream

88.619 --> 94.2
got caught off with YouTube I have to

90.9 --> 94.2
like re-install

94.86 --> 99.6
a new new print and that includes a new

97.799 --> 103.92
chat

99.6 --> 106.259
it won't take the old chat with it

103.92 --> 110.1
it's not the same chat for some reason

106.259 --> 112.07900000000001
with my format it starts a new live chat

110.1 --> 115.46
every time

112.079 --> 115.46
or start recording

121.079 --> 124.939
close and okay

126.92 --> 133.319
[Music]

129.86 --> 135.48000000000002
I'm not seeing that happen turret

133.319 --> 138.73899999999998
might be a glitch on your side I'm

135.48 --> 138.73899999999998
refreshing it's still there

142.44 --> 148.319
maybe this is just a mobile thing

146.099 --> 151.67999999999998
foreign

148.319 --> 156.44
I mean everything shows up even in the

151.68 --> 156.44
in the video or uh yeah over there right

170.18 --> 175.739
okay Sarah I don't know

173.879 --> 178.34
I'm not having that issue I don't know

175.739 --> 178.34
what's going on

212.64 --> 217.76
still shows playing live for many hours

217.98 --> 222.17999999999998
okay that's weird that's not happening

220.92 --> 224.22
to me

222.18 --> 227.78
sounds like it just forgot to press

224.22 --> 227.78
press the uh

228.36 --> 232.37900000000002
like maybe that's what happens when you

230.34 --> 234.299
just close OBS in the middle of

232.379 --> 235.92
recording instead of saying stop

234.299 --> 238.08
streaming

235.92 --> 240.599
I don't know what's going on I'm not

238.08 --> 243.299
gonna speculate on what's

240.599 --> 246.599
like what's happening with you by the

243.299 --> 249.72
way steamy Trail over tarot Jared is not

246.599 --> 252.35999999999999
exactly a master of uh

249.72 --> 254.76
streaming interfacing and everything I

252.36 --> 257.78000000000003
mean you can't even get its his sound

254.76 --> 257.78
levels balanced

258.54 --> 266.1
so I wouldn't blame technical

261.62 --> 270.02
difficulties on glitches too much

266.1 --> 270.02000000000004
when things go wrong on this show

288.36 --> 291.36
foreign

291.65 --> 294.71
[Music]

295.02 --> 299.96
look at that Derek you got a fan

302.4 --> 306.85999999999996
dude you're the lunar orbiter fan

308.94 --> 314.04
I'm gonna take a bite of this Illuminati

310.86 --> 316.16
cosine before I faint

314.04 --> 316.16
um

322.71 --> 325.88
[Music]

331.86 --> 334.34000000000003
okay

349.08 --> 352.82
oh by the way talking about

353.699 --> 357.8
a bit Freemason space activities

358.86 --> 366.8
did they actually send any people

362.16 --> 366.8
on the moon lander in India now

372.12 --> 378.0
I just want to see if any of those

374.4 --> 383.46
Freemasons are just willing

378.0 --> 385.68
to like do another actual moonwalk again

383.46 --> 387.59999999999997
it's like since since the American moon

385.68 --> 389.16
landing all of them just completely

387.6 --> 391.139
chicken out

389.16 --> 392.88000000000005
right

391.139 --> 395.58
I mean there's all kinds of activity

392.88 --> 399.479
like the Mars rover

395.58 --> 401.639
oh satellite this set like that yeah

399.479 --> 403.56
when is somebody gonna freaking walk on

401.639 --> 406.86
that Moon again man

403.56 --> 410.46
why didn't you just try it again yeah

406.86 --> 414.66
and now with up-to-date specs like are

410.46 --> 416.88
your resolution camera come on come on

414.66 --> 419.84000000000003
we want to see it

416.88 --> 419.84
do it then

430.699 --> 435.44
yeah LSG yeah I don't know what happened

436.62 --> 440.639
just in the middle of my stream YouTube

438.66 --> 443.639
started stalling

440.639 --> 447.12
then I got a pop-up message like oh OBS

443.639 --> 449.40000000000003
is is having trouble but that made no

447.12 --> 451.199
sense because I was looking at OBS and

449.4 --> 452.58
there's like this green light for like

451.199 --> 456.41900000000004
the process

452.58 --> 459.18
and it goes orange or red when OBS is

456.419 --> 463.15999999999997
disconnecting basically it wasn't doing

459.18 --> 463.16
that at all so it's I don't know

465.419 --> 470.639
it's like oh OBS did something wrong

467.699 --> 473.46000000000004
yeah but OBS is running perfectly so it

470.639 --> 475.94
I felt that it was a glitch from YouTube

473.46 --> 475.94
side

476.639 --> 481.44
I don't know what it was but anyway

478.86 --> 484.46000000000004
we're back it's not really a subject to

481.44 --> 484.46
spend 10 minutes on

487.979 --> 494.099
you know why they won't show us a man on

491.4 --> 497.28
the moon again yeah of course I know but

494.099 --> 499.86
that but it doesn't mean that it's like

497.28 --> 501.9
they should do it again it's like just

499.86 --> 503.28000000000003
do it again it doesn't matter if you're

501.9 --> 505.85999999999996
gonna [ __ ] up

503.28 --> 508.919
it doesn't [ __ ] matter

505.86 --> 512.339
just do it already this endless tactic

508.919 --> 513.779
of just postponing the [ __ ] just get

512.339 --> 516.7790000000001
on with it

513.779 --> 520.2
do the full [ __ ] thing

516.779 --> 523.14
like build an actual moon base with

520.2 --> 525.4200000000001
people and astronaut suits walking on

523.14 --> 528.42
the moon opening a door getting inside

525.42 --> 531.899
of a pod just [ __ ] do it already stop

528.42 --> 535.1999999999999
being such a pitiful wussies

531.899 --> 537.0
we know it's fake we know there's going

535.2 --> 538.62
to be errors and conspiracy theorists

537.0 --> 541.08
are going to be all over it and talking

538.62 --> 544.019
about it from just [ __ ] do it already

541.08 --> 546.6
you goddamn wussies

544.019 --> 549.54
just [ __ ] do it

546.6 --> 552.5400000000001
you pitiful wasis

549.54 --> 555.5999999999999
oh we're the masters of Mind Control oh

552.54 --> 560.54
we make the Illusion for their then do

555.6 --> 560.5400000000001
it already you stupid worcest

569.279 --> 573.72
okay

570.74 --> 576.779
and the people who matter

573.72 --> 579.44
like they don't care anyway doesn't

576.779 --> 583.019
matter even if you had like

579.44 --> 587.1600000000001
super Hollywood CGI of the future

583.019 --> 588.899
quality video of it whatever it wouldn't

587.16 --> 590.1
matter

588.899 --> 593.459
because

590.1 --> 595.8000000000001
there were people that matter no it

593.459 --> 598.1999999999999
can't be real no matter how real it

595.8 --> 600.3599999999999
looks doesn't matter

598.2 --> 601.5
it's physically impossible we already

600.36 --> 604.019
know

601.5 --> 605.94
and everything else look at how dumb

604.019 --> 608.1
they are like they're not gonna tell the

605.94 --> 610.5600000000001
difference

608.1 --> 613.8000000000001
they're not even picking up on your in

610.56 --> 617.0
your face idiocy like they make up

613.8 --> 621.3
excuses live on the spot for your

617.0 --> 624.12
colossal magician hat dropping mistakes

621.3 --> 627.7199999999999
okay they already do it it doesn't

624.12 --> 630.0
matter if any activity on the moon that

627.72 --> 633.26
you're gonna show doesn't fit or doesn't

630.0 --> 639.68
it doesn't [ __ ] matter anymore man

633.26 --> 639.68
just do it you [ __ ] wussies

645.54 --> 648.1999999999999
okay

656.94 --> 661.98
um

658.98 --> 661.98
foreign

667.38 --> 673.68
I'm not talking specifically to like the

670.44 --> 673.6800000000001
Indian Freemasons

674.399 --> 677.66
I'm talking in general

681.66 --> 685.68
I mean hell

683.279 --> 688.26
the freaking Americans should just do it

685.68 --> 692.12
again like [ __ ] it

688.26 --> 692.12
just completely [ __ ] it

694.079 --> 699.0
just do it again

696.779 --> 701.899
and this time [ __ ] up in a different way

699.0 --> 701.899
it doesn't matter

711.959 --> 716.2399999999999
like anything is better than nothing

724.32 --> 730.2600000000001
if you want to get things moving

726.42 --> 734.2199999999999
energetically among the believing crowd

730.26 --> 736.56
you got to give them Something Real

734.22 --> 739.32
and not just preliminaries of oh we're

736.56 --> 743.279
seeing a rocket oh yeah that's so cute

739.32 --> 745.9200000000001
no you're gonna fake that the actual

743.279 --> 748.4399999999999
extra planetary body

745.92 --> 750.899
stuff you gotta actually do that

748.44 --> 753.1800000000001
with a person

750.899 --> 757.64
with people in search just do it already

753.18 --> 757.64
stop being such a [ __ ] wussy

757.92 --> 764.9399999999999
nobody gives a [ __ ] you can't make the

761.82 --> 766.2600000000001
lighting work and all that who gives a

764.94 --> 768.5400000000001
[ __ ]

766.26 --> 771.06
yeah there's not even a logical

768.54 --> 773.2199999999999
consistency within the story about

771.06 --> 775.26
whether they're star visible or not

773.22 --> 779.22
outside of the Earth's atmosphere okay

775.26 --> 782.48
so who gives a [ __ ] if you're stupid

779.22 --> 785.4590000000001
moon landing trick can be made perfect

782.48 --> 787.7
who gives a [ __ ] just [ __ ] do it

785.459 --> 787.6999999999999
already

821.82 --> 828.24
I bet Trump would do it

825.24 --> 832.5600000000001
your drum was the president again you

828.24 --> 836.24
would actually do it he would actually

832.56 --> 836.2399999999999
send a man to the Moon

837.31 --> 840.4599999999999
[Music]

849.959 --> 856.38
it would certainly get rid of his

852.92 --> 860.2199999999999
conspiracy theory mongering from other

856.38 --> 862.4399999999999
people saying that he doubts the moon

860.22 --> 865.74
landing it was fake well that doesn't

862.44 --> 867.6600000000001
mean that he believes the Earth is flat

865.74 --> 869.519
it could mean that he just thinks it

867.66 --> 870.48
wasn't real because it looked really

869.519 --> 873.18
fake

870.48 --> 877.639
you want to do it for real this time

873.18 --> 877.6389999999999
a more realistic looking moon landing

890.519 --> 895.199
and I mean it would be great maneuver to

893.16 --> 897.48
get the left

895.199 --> 900.899
maybe they could like

897.48 --> 904.44
do a giant projector of Trump's face on

900.899 --> 906.839
the moon so that every leftist whenever

904.44 --> 909.4200000000001
they look up in the night sky there's

906.839 --> 911.72
always a chance they can see Trump's

909.42 --> 911.7199999999999
face

945.48 --> 951.32
but you're right Jared I mean they have

947.639 --> 951.32
postponed it just too many times

952.68 --> 957.3
it's like they could never make up for

955.199 --> 959.8199999999999
postponing it they could never make it

957.3 --> 963.0
flashy enough

959.82 --> 964.32
but they could just do it anyway though

963.0 --> 968.3
like

964.32 --> 968.3000000000001
you know what the best solution would be

968.639 --> 975.12
the Moon is huge we're gonna make it

971.279 --> 978.38
even Huger that's hilarious

975.12 --> 978.38
thank you for that LSG

978.54 --> 982.88
trombone that run for president again

980.22 --> 982.88
yeah whatever

989.22 --> 993.24
if he's not gonna overtly become

991.199 --> 995.9399999999999
president then he'll probably just try

993.24 --> 1000.38
to take over the Deep state

995.94 --> 1004.839
and run from the from behind the scenes

1000.38 --> 1004.8389999999999
like Obama does right now

1027.62 --> 1035.2399999999998
right but the best tactic to

1031.579 --> 1038.24
stop this moon landing nonsense

1035.24 --> 1041.0
is to and hear me out on this this is

1038.24 --> 1044.199
this is actual tactic that could work

1041.0 --> 1044.199
sounds crazy Maybe

1044.36 --> 1050.7199999999998
you suddenly do the moon landing not

1047.959 --> 1054.02
about oh we're finally gonna do it right

1050.72 --> 1056.66
not trying to play into

1054.02 --> 1060.799
like oh yeah we know we've postparted so

1056.66 --> 1064.3400000000001
many no no literally forget all that

1060.799 --> 1066.62
like literally pretend it never happened

1064.34 --> 1070.76
all that postponing all the false

1066.62 --> 1072.559
promises pretend it never happened

1070.76 --> 1074.36
and then

1072.559 --> 1078.3799999999999
suddenly

1074.36 --> 1081.76
subtly roll it out like

1078.38 --> 1081.7600000000002
there's a launch tomorrow

1082.22 --> 1087.039
it's a it's a a new moon mission

1087.32 --> 1092.0
and just like not

1090.02 --> 1093.799
like there will be more details and then

1092.0 --> 1095.72
when they launch it's like you see

1093.799 --> 1098.36
actual astronauts

1095.72 --> 1100.88
and all that and like wait what

1098.36 --> 1102.5
yeah yeah they're going to the Moon

1100.88 --> 1104.8400000000001
they're like we're going back to the

1102.5 --> 1107.539
Moon just like that you get to hear it

1104.84 --> 1110.539
on the day and they actually launch like

1107.539 --> 1112.46
right after you just heard for the first

1110.539 --> 1115.58
time that they're actually going back on

1112.46 --> 1119.0
the moon and then do it immediately like

1115.58 --> 1121.1599999999999
immediately no oh we're gonna do it oh

1119.0 --> 1122.799
we need investors oh we're [ __ ] no no no

1121.16 --> 1128.2
no no Puja

1122.799 --> 1128.2
just subtly roll it out suddenly do it

1129.02 --> 1133.94
you gotta prepare this [ __ ] ahead of

1131.179 --> 1136.2800000000002
time just subtly do it

1133.94 --> 1137.8400000000001
suddenly go back to the Moon

1136.28 --> 1140.78
and like

1137.84 --> 1143.48
don't even do all the prep [ __ ] like

1140.78 --> 1147.76
oh look at the CGI of this equipment we

1143.48 --> 1150.98
got no make it all a surprise

1147.76 --> 1153.5
let the stuff be used live and

1150.98 --> 1157.22
interactive and then

1153.5 --> 1160.1
have it be seen for the very first time

1157.22 --> 1162.6200000000001
publicly like as it's literally

1160.1 --> 1165.26
happening or well as it's being tricked

1162.62 --> 1168.02
to happen right so that it's all really

1165.26 --> 1170.539
like wait what they're doing what what

1168.02 --> 1174.08
that's that effect

1170.539 --> 1177.14
but you gotta swipe away all that

1174.08 --> 1179.059
horseshit postponement false false

1177.14 --> 1181.46
promises from the past you gotta do it

1179.059 --> 1185.3799999999999
like that you want to go back to the

1181.46 --> 1185.38
moon for real that's the way to do it

1189.44 --> 1192.88
just suddenly do it

1203.66 --> 1211.3600000000001
no stupid robots no satellites no people

1208.039 --> 1211.36
in spacesuits

1212.72 --> 1217.64
just suddenly do it

1215.72 --> 1220.34
and afterwards you could always say that

1217.64 --> 1222.0200000000002
you had to be kept secret because

1220.34 --> 1225.08
you were afraid it was going to get

1222.02 --> 1228.3799999999999
sabotaged or something

1225.08 --> 1231.5
like sort of War times with

1228.38 --> 1234.679
Hypersonic missiles Etc they would even

1231.5 --> 1238.46
have a bit of an excuse

1234.679 --> 1241.5800000000002
to keep it a secret see yeah guys I am

1238.46 --> 1243.8600000000001
good at this yeah I could run NASA

1241.58 --> 1247.52
if they let me

1243.86 --> 1249.9399999999998
I could be the planner or like how to do

1247.52 --> 1249.94
these things

1252.86 --> 1260.9189999999999
but I mean I'm not gonna be but

1256.16 --> 1260.919
because I burned their eyes out

1265.7 --> 1270.94
I drive them nuts talking about a flat

1268.76 --> 1270.94
Earth

1283.299 --> 1290.48
they shoot movies that have premieres

1287.419 --> 1294.3200000000002
yes exactly do you understand my point

1290.48 --> 1296.84
LSG are and if you actually listening to

1294.32 --> 1298.76
what I'm saying for a change instead of

1296.84 --> 1302.86
afterward

1298.76 --> 1302.86
but actually during the chatting

1303.679 --> 1307.299
do you want to do a moon landing

1307.58 --> 1312.799
do it suddenly no oh we're finally going

1311.12 --> 1315.9799999999998
back because then everybody's gonna be

1312.799 --> 1318.02
like oh here we go again everybody's

1315.98 --> 1320.179
because this is basically like a

1318.02 --> 1322.6399999999999
relationship right so there's this

1320.179 --> 1324.98
husband called NASA

1322.64 --> 1328.3400000000001
that's saying like oh man I'm gonna make

1324.98 --> 1330.679
it I'm gonna score big time this time

1328.34 --> 1332.4189999999999
and the wife is like oh yeah awesome wow

1330.679 --> 1334.76
like the like that moon landing right

1332.419 --> 1338.0
when we first met

1334.76 --> 1341.299
and yeah yeah but they're never doing it

1338.0 --> 1345.14
well what happens when you over promise

1341.299 --> 1348.679
your wife and you don't deliver they get

1345.14 --> 1350.659
really tired of it and then the only way

1348.679 --> 1353.72
to fix it

1350.659 --> 1357.0800000000002
is to subtly out of nowhere do it like

1353.72 --> 1360.26
like yeah of course it's see it it was

1357.08 --> 1363.22
always right there that's the only way

1360.26 --> 1363.22
to fix that

1363.26 --> 1369.26
you gotta suddenly show up

1366.26 --> 1371.96
with the things that you lacked and that

1369.26 --> 1374.179
you falsely promised like it was always

1371.96 --> 1376.48
there that's the only way you can fix

1374.179 --> 1376.48
that

1377.72 --> 1384.74
don't give them a call oh I finally

1382.4 --> 1386.8400000000001
no that that look makes you look super

1384.74 --> 1389.659
gay and they're not gonna get through no

1386.84 --> 1392.78
you gotta subtly unexpectedly be right

1389.659 --> 1394.5800000000002
there like yeah

1392.78 --> 1396.82
see

1394.58 --> 1396.82
foreign

1410.6 --> 1416.059
you guys know I'm right right I mean

1414.2 --> 1420.38
yeah I might not be the most smooth

1416.059 --> 1424.28
talking woman pic pickupy guy out there

1420.38 --> 1428.0590000000002
but I know how relationships work when

1424.28 --> 1430.6
they're actually engage I do I do know

1428.059 --> 1430.6
these things

1431.059 --> 1436.1
very strong feeling for that always took

1433.76 --> 1438.99
relationships very serious more serious

1436.1 --> 1439.58
than my partners usually did

1438.99 --> 1441.58
[Music]

1439.58 --> 1441.58
um

1458.36 --> 1460.9599999999998
what

1463.82 --> 1467.4189999999999
uh why are you saying the same thing

1465.86 --> 1469.58
over again

1467.419 --> 1472.039
Maximus flat here so why the hell did

1469.58 --> 1475.24
you say something to yourself

1472.039 --> 1475.24
that's just weird

1509.12 --> 1512.7399999999998
redesigner spacesuits

1515.179 --> 1519.5590000000002
well they basically got to make up their

1517.58 --> 1521.6589999999999
minds on how realistic they are gonna

1519.559 --> 1522.799
have their setting

1521.659 --> 1525.5590000000002
how

1522.799 --> 1528.799
useful for the actors to be able to do

1525.559 --> 1531.86
their thing with it versus how realistic

1528.799 --> 1534.3799999999999
do you want space to be taken

1531.86 --> 1536.059
within your enactment

1534.38 --> 1538.7
yeah

1536.059 --> 1541.34
I'd say a Middle Road make it look a

1538.7 --> 1544.5800000000002
little updated but don't actually try to

1541.34 --> 1548.0
actually fix it because well

1544.58 --> 1551.299
if you want look here's my opinion

1548.0 --> 1554.299
it's a cosmogenist

1551.299 --> 1554.299
yes

1558.64 --> 1562.6000000000001
the [ __ ] off

1570.74 --> 1576.46
why don't you just [ __ ] off

1581.72 --> 1585.76
[ __ ] hate those types of flies

1585.919 --> 1590.8400000000001
it's not because they're they always get

1588.74 --> 1592.82
in your [ __ ] face

1590.84 --> 1595.6399999999999
why

1592.82 --> 1598.36
like they don't need to do that

1595.64 --> 1598.3600000000001
ah

1604.4 --> 1606.94
talking about

1607.64 --> 1613.3400000000001
oh yeah space suits yeah they oh they

1610.279 --> 1614.9
need to update yeah if you updated too

1613.34 --> 1618.1399999999999
realistically

1614.9 --> 1621.02
as in what would an actual effective

1618.14 --> 1623.659
space would be like well you basically

1621.02 --> 1626.539
have to build like a Mecca suit

1623.659 --> 1630.679
a robot around you like a

1626.539 --> 1635.2
flexible gas tank

1630.679 --> 1635.2
flexible cloth isn't gonna work guys

1635.539 --> 1640.8799999999999
it will make you blow up like a balloon

1637.88 --> 1642.0200000000002
they make you absolutely unable to

1640.88 --> 1644.96
maneuver

1642.02 --> 1648.799
in outer space

1644.96 --> 1652.52
so to turn it into more like a deep

1648.799 --> 1654.32
ocean diving suit but really robotic so

1652.52 --> 1656.44
like everything would be like a metal

1654.32 --> 1658.7
tank with

1656.44 --> 1661.76
maneuvering joints

1658.7 --> 1664.1000000000001
yeah really clunky to move with that it

1661.76 --> 1666.14
should probably be robotically enhanced

1664.1 --> 1669.4399999999998
so that you don't have to maneuver

1666.14 --> 1670.64
everything super tiresome

1669.44 --> 1672.919
but

1670.64 --> 1674.96
that would be a more realistic type of

1672.919 --> 1677.779
spacesuit if you actually took this for

1674.96 --> 1679.64
real but I mean that's intangible it's

1677.779 --> 1681.74
very hard to build it's probably very

1679.64 --> 1683.0
hard to work with in the in the in the

1681.74 --> 1686.299
pool

1683.0 --> 1690.4
so you gotta then just take the old

1686.299 --> 1692.779
spacesuit that's just the stupid suit

1690.4 --> 1695.299
and just

1692.779 --> 1697.1
make it a little bit better it's better

1695.299 --> 1700.1589999999999
looking

1697.1 --> 1703.1
maybe like update like the Techno

1700.159 --> 1705.14
gadgets whatever that's like taking care

1703.1 --> 1708.3799999999999
of the air inside or the moist or

1705.14 --> 1710.9
whatever and that's that should be fine

1708.38 --> 1713.3600000000001
you don't need you don't actually need

1710.9 --> 1715.4
to have it be realistic

1713.36 --> 1718.3999999999999
because you can't make it too realistic

1715.4 --> 1720.8600000000001
because then it becomes untenable

1718.4 --> 1723.2
you can't set the bar too high too

1720.86 --> 1725.6589999999999
realistic

1723.2 --> 1727.46
or you'll make any future projects

1725.659 --> 1731.74
completely impossible and it will

1727.46 --> 1731.74
contrast too much with the old work

1735.08 --> 1741.3999999999999
so there you go here's my Oracle advice

1738.2 --> 1741.4
of [ __ ] NASA

1748.88 --> 1752.6200000000001
better not goddess yeah I know

1753.08 --> 1760.6
I like Australia at a distance

1757.159 --> 1760.6000000000001
on a video call

1761.059 --> 1763.539
foreign

1765.02 --> 1771.399
but yeah Australia's Wildlife is a

1767.779 --> 1771.399
little bit too wild for me on average

1783.34 --> 1789.6789999999999
it's especially the typical size of the

1786.74 --> 1791.059
insects there that kind of put me off a

1789.679 --> 1793.3990000000001
bit

1791.059 --> 1795.98
I mean I like insects

1793.399 --> 1798.3799999999999
when they're small except for mosquitoes

1795.98 --> 1801.799
and flies but even not even all flies

1798.38 --> 1804.46
those types of [ __ ] flies I hate not

1801.799 --> 1807.34
all fights that's like the big

1804.46 --> 1810.559
those aren't like

1807.34 --> 1813.6399999999999
annoying bastard flies that get in your

1810.559 --> 1816.5
face those are just really loud

1813.64 --> 1819.38
helicopters they're just gonna right

1816.5 --> 1822.559
they might get and they'll you can

1819.38 --> 1825.5590000000002
easily basically send them out

1822.559 --> 1829.8799999999999
or catch them and but those [ __ ]

1825.559 --> 1832.6
types of flies those are so annoying

1829.88 --> 1832.6000000000001
so

1839.48 --> 1844.82
yeah they can't make this 60s foot no it

1842.179 --> 1847.7
is not too fake it's too outdated it

1844.82 --> 1849.799
they can't make it look it still has to

1847.7 --> 1852.38
in contrast look like the old stuff

1849.799 --> 1853.7
could have worked somehow on on the feel

1852.38 --> 1855.7990000000002
right

1853.7 --> 1859.52
so if you're suddenly like oh we have to

1855.799 --> 1861.44
have a completely tanker based suit for

1859.52 --> 1863.72
pretty deep space

1861.44 --> 1865.3400000000001
because the regular spacesuit's not safe

1863.72 --> 1868.7
enough well

1865.34 --> 1871.34
that would really put question marks on

1868.7 --> 1874.52
the old spaces you see

1871.34 --> 1876.4399999999998
so that's what I meant

1874.52 --> 1879.3799999999999
if you're gonna get too realistic about

1876.44 --> 1881.419
the new product then like it will make

1879.38 --> 1886.179
the old one look

1881.419 --> 1886.179
like very extra questionable

1890.84 --> 1895.6399999999999
right unless you want to make it into

1893.24 --> 1898.1
like a super great spacesuit you could

1895.64 --> 1899.6000000000001
do that you could actually like have

1898.1 --> 1902.0
classes

1899.6 --> 1904.279
different classes of spacesuit I mean it

1902.0 --> 1906.08
happens in space movies too

1904.279 --> 1908.24
like you have like the regular

1906.08 --> 1912.5
spaceshoot you're flexible you could fix

1908.24 --> 1915.6200000000001
things or you could have the robot suit

1912.5 --> 1919.159
which would be like a sort of mobile

1915.62 --> 1921.3799999999999
welding platform like you could use that

1919.159 --> 1922.159
suit for welding easily that kind of

1921.38 --> 1926.779
thing

1922.159 --> 1930.38
uh welding in space but those types of

1926.779 --> 1932.779
things like serious repair work and

1930.38 --> 1934.3990000000001
you'd be completely safe from micro

1932.779 --> 1937.399
meteors

1934.399 --> 1939.6789999999999
unless they're like extremely heavy

1937.399 --> 1941.6
but like yeah you can be punctured

1939.679 --> 1943.5800000000002
easily because you're more armored so

1941.6 --> 1946.52
that it would be like a special class

1943.58 --> 1950.32
extra space suit they could do that but

1946.52 --> 1950.32
I mean it's quite a project to do that

1958.52 --> 1962.4189999999999
look at me getting everybody all

1960.38 --> 1965.24
enthusiastic about

1962.419 --> 1968.6000000000001
space endeavors

1965.24 --> 1971.5
I mean it is pretty cool to like

1968.6 --> 1971.5
do it

1974.659 --> 1979.22
but I mean you're gonna have to have

1977.12 --> 1980.899
like a whole bunch of new astronauts on

1979.22 --> 1983.0
your ass now

1980.899 --> 1985.2199999999998
just like the three old ones that are

1983.0 --> 1988.84
gonna like have to stick to this story

1985.22 --> 1988.84
now the rest of their life so

1989.0 --> 1993.7
maybe that part is the hard part

1994.82 --> 2000.779
maybe they just can't find

1997.46 --> 2004.98
NASA astronaut figures that are like

2000.779 --> 2004.98
willing to take that on again

2008.159 --> 2011.3990000000001
I don't know

2018.279 --> 2023.799
yeah Kevin K I mean yes when you look at

2022.12 --> 2025.4189999999999
the moon lander the old one it is

2023.799 --> 2028.32
ridiculous looking

2025.419 --> 2028.3200000000002
absolutely

2028.48 --> 2034.679
although I mean in your imagination it's

2031.0 --> 2034.679
still like whoa space thing

2035.44 --> 2040.179
I mean when I was a little kid that

2037.72 --> 2043.0
thing could work it's like no it could

2040.179 --> 2046.0
work yeah but it looks

2043.0 --> 2046.0
like messy

2047.559 --> 2051.7799999999997
but I mean yeah it still works

2052.96 --> 2059.08
just don't don't think too much about it

2056.919 --> 2060.879
hmm

2059.08 --> 2062.859
no but as a little kid I thought that

2060.879 --> 2065.379
could work I also thought that the Earth

2062.859 --> 2067.72
could be flat perfectly fascinated me

2065.379 --> 2069.7
very much but I mean I had it all at the

2067.72 --> 2072.7
same time

2069.7 --> 2075.2999999999997
I was like oh yeah the Earth is flat

2072.7 --> 2075.2999999999997
but

2075.639 --> 2079.4190000000003
yeah

2076.899 --> 2083.2599999999998
you could still land on the Moon

2079.419 --> 2087.1589999999997
I was like that in my mind I like had

2083.26 --> 2090.5200000000004
very little objection or friction from

2087.159 --> 2092.9190000000003
seeing it as like oh the Earth is flat

2090.52 --> 2097.5
but the Moon is a ball and you can land

2092.919 --> 2097.5
on it I was like yeah why not

2097.72 --> 2100.7999999999997
I'm flexible

2110.26 --> 2115.8390000000004
I would always just like assimilate

2112.72 --> 2118.9599999999996
separated stories and not really put it

2115.839 --> 2121.42
all together I would

2118.96 --> 2126.119
look at it from that perspective and

2121.42 --> 2126.119
then see the stuff that surrounds it

2127.119 --> 2133.48
but I wouldn't really be concerned too

2130.18 --> 2137.3199999999997
much as a little kid now talking with

2133.48 --> 2139.359
trying to make one thing fit another

2137.32 --> 2141.52
thing I was like

2139.359 --> 2143.2599999999998
and I'm too young for that and they'll

2141.52 --> 2146.619
come later

2143.26 --> 2149.38
so I I didn't see how things couldn't be

2146.619 --> 2151.7400000000002
together I was one thing contradicted

2149.38 --> 2154.48
another I didn't really see that as much

2151.74 --> 2156.339
so to me it was like yeah Earth is flat

2154.48 --> 2158.339
that's pretty cool and they're lying

2156.339 --> 2162.18
about things

2158.339 --> 2162.18
uh but I mean

2162.28 --> 2166.7200000000003
yeah the moon could still be a ball of

2164.56 --> 2169.0
dirt out there

2166.72 --> 2170.56
that you could fly to and land on why

2169.0 --> 2172.48
not

2170.56 --> 2174.2799999999997
I mean just because the Earth is flat

2172.48 --> 2177.7
wouldn't mean that that is impossible

2174.28 --> 2178.7200000000003
that's how I thought I was like yeah I

2177.7 --> 2180.8199999999997
mean

2178.72 --> 2185.0789999999997
why not

2180.82 --> 2187.839
now of course since my teens especially

2185.079 --> 2191.32
after that I became a lot more critical

2187.839 --> 2194.2
thinking like a lot more like

2191.32 --> 2195.579
comparing actually comparing the

2194.2 --> 2199.1189999999997
information

2195.579 --> 2201.82
right to see the look for matches as it

2199.119 --> 2204.099
like after 18 I didn't really

2201.82 --> 2206.7400000000002
do that as much I would always just take

2204.099 --> 2208.9
an instance and then expand on it

2206.74 --> 2210.52
very eloquently

2208.9 --> 2212.2000000000003
it kind of made me look like a little

2210.52 --> 2215.94
genius at times

2212.2 --> 2215.9399999999996
and I was really proud of that

2218.619 --> 2223.96
but I couldn't connect it up

2221.26 --> 2224.92
I had a lot of trouble doing that

2223.96 --> 2227.8
process

2224.92 --> 2230.079
even as a teen I had trouble with it it

2227.8 --> 2231.82
made me feel stupid

2230.079 --> 2234.46
those people would point out like this

2231.82 --> 2235.1800000000003
and that doesn't match and I would be

2234.46 --> 2236.56
like

2235.18 --> 2238.96
all right

2236.56 --> 2241.48
why not

2238.96 --> 2244.56
see I didn't have that Talent

2241.48 --> 2248.079
I had to train it

2244.56 --> 2250.599
now I'm so [ __ ] good at it it's

2248.079 --> 2251.38
second nature and I'm like really good

2250.599 --> 2254.56
at

2251.38 --> 2255.579
like fractal oversight is like my thing

2254.56 --> 2258.04
now

2255.579 --> 2260.5600000000004
but when I started when I was very young

2258.04 --> 2263.02
I didn't have any of that

2260.56 --> 2266.14
I would just see in the moment I could

2263.02 --> 2267.88
like sort of fractally expand upon one

2266.14 --> 2269.7999999999997
thing as it happened

2267.88 --> 2271.6600000000003
like a seed is being planted and

2269.8 --> 2273.7000000000003
suddenly it grows and it turns into

2271.66 --> 2275.98
whatever it's gonna turn into and I just

2273.7 --> 2278.3799999999997
understand that

2275.98 --> 2281.02
but I wouldn't like compare it to

2278.38 --> 2283.06
everything else I I was like I could

2281.02 --> 2284.88
just could do I just I guess I didn't

2283.06 --> 2288.46
have enough information

2284.88 --> 2292.3
assimilated to be able to get a proper

2288.46 --> 2294.7
oversight it's like the AI testing phase

2292.3 --> 2297.3390000000004
was too early testing it's still just

2294.7 --> 2299.6189999999997
like oh wobbling around and walking in a

2297.339 --> 2301.9
wall and falling to its death

2299.619 --> 2304.96
continually like I was I didn't have

2301.9 --> 2308.2000000000003
enough information to actually get a

2304.96 --> 2311.02
oversight mechanism working

2308.2 --> 2312.64
and it's really after my teens

2311.02 --> 2314.8
because I still didn't have it in my

2312.64 --> 2316.9
teens and that's what I was so [ __ ]

2314.8 --> 2318.76
frustrated about right and then I got to

2316.9 --> 2321.04
see Dark World Vision of the future and

2318.76 --> 2324.2200000000003
I was like that's I have to have that

2321.04 --> 2326.339
right now I need it right now and I

2324.22 --> 2326.339
couldn't

2328.839 --> 2337.2
the thing I have now right now in

2331.839 --> 2337.2
in 2023 and before that even

2338.26 --> 2343.5400000000004
I wanted that when I was a teen I I saw

2341.32 --> 2346.54
it and I needed it I was like I need

2343.54 --> 2349.39
that now I need that now to fix my life

2346.54 --> 2352.469
but it doesn't work that way I could

2349.39 --> 2352.469
[Music]

2360.579 --> 2363.119
all right

2364.96 --> 2369.579
[Music]

2366.94 --> 2371.44
but yeah once you get enough experience

2369.579 --> 2375.6600000000003
then you can start to cross reference

2371.44 --> 2375.66
and then you really see what is what

2376.3 --> 2380.1400000000003
because you can compare it to everything

2378.88 --> 2382.7200000000003
else

2380.14 --> 2385.24
you need the experience to be able to

2382.72 --> 2391.48
compare everything to everything else

2385.24 --> 2391.4799999999996
I'm gonna take sip of this huh cheers

2397.79 --> 2401.079
[Music]

2411.82 --> 2416.82
maybe you don't have to yes I definitely

2414.22 --> 2419.56
do that's the only way you get

2416.82 --> 2422.02
understanding that's how you start to

2419.56 --> 2423.7
understand things like the nature of

2422.02 --> 2427.119
things their frequency

2423.7 --> 2430.359
you can isolate a frequency if you can't

2427.119 --> 2432.82
compare it to anything else you see

2430.359 --> 2435.52
how would you recognize that that thing

2432.82 --> 2438.1800000000003
is that thing when you have nothing to

2435.52 --> 2438.18
compare it to

2438.339 --> 2443.92
that's basically it

2440.859 --> 2448.3199999999997
and that is also the root core the the

2443.92 --> 2448.32
core root of wisdom

2451.18 --> 2455.0989999999997
I mean when you really boil it down

2453.099 --> 2457.54
wisdom is just

2455.099 --> 2460.5
understanding things by comparing it to

2457.54 --> 2460.5
everything else you know

2460.96 --> 2466.2
on every level so that you get the feel

2463.3 --> 2469.8390000000004
of it on your intuitive level and your

2466.2 --> 2472.1189999999997
spontaneous level and on your fractal

2469.839 --> 2474.82
implication level like cognitive

2472.119 --> 2477.88
comparison like the compare it on every

2474.82 --> 2480.339
level and then you really understand

2477.88 --> 2481.96
but you have to have that experience you

2480.339 --> 2483.339
have to have gone through that you have

2481.96 --> 2485.56
to have those

2483.339 --> 2488.98
have had those insights and developed

2485.56 --> 2491.14
them and then seeing things through that

2488.98 --> 2493.599
information lens

2491.14 --> 2495.52
and then you can actually start to

2493.599 --> 2497.88
compare everything and it will really

2495.52 --> 2497.88
work

2502.54 --> 2509.4
to actually understand things

2506.26 --> 2509.4
is a lot of work

2514.06 --> 2517.96
because to understand things properly

2516.52 --> 2520.18
you have to basically understand

2517.96 --> 2522.52
everything

2520.18 --> 2524.2
and understand everything isn't an

2522.52 --> 2526.3
absolute it doesn't mean that you have

2524.2 --> 2528.8799999999997
to literally know absolutely everything

2526.3 --> 2530.5600000000004
about everything but it means that you

2528.88 --> 2532.839
have to develop knowledge about

2530.56 --> 2535.72
everything and then even with

2532.839 --> 2537.339
the trace knowledge about a whole lot of

2535.72 --> 2539.3199999999997
things

2537.339 --> 2542.14
you have

2539.32 --> 2545.1400000000003
a reflection board you have

2542.14 --> 2547.72
an anchor

2545.14 --> 2551.14
you have a grounding you have a

2547.72 --> 2554.68
foundation to compare something to and

2551.14 --> 2557.56
then size up and place it in reference

2554.68 --> 2560.7999999999997
to that reference board

2557.56 --> 2563.68
that's what wisdom is

2560.8 --> 2566.7400000000002
and you need experience for that

2563.68 --> 2569.6189999999997
you need to do things and make mistakes

2566.74 --> 2570.9399999999996
and understand those mistakes and how

2569.619 --> 2574.38
they work

2570.94 --> 2574.38
and everything all of that

2585.94 --> 2591.3
right so yeah a little bit on the nature

2588.339 --> 2591.2999999999997
of wisdom itself

2591.78 --> 2595.8590000000004
[Music]

2593.56 --> 2595.859
foreign

2597.23 --> 2600.289
[Music]

2603.25 --> 2614.409
[Music]

2615.52 --> 2621.94
how to fake a new moon landing and the

2618.579 --> 2624.04
nature of wisdom itself

2621.94 --> 2626.28
it's pretty damn good title if I say so

2624.04 --> 2626.2799999999997
myself

2635.28 --> 2641.44
what do you can't wait wait to get [ __ ]

2639.28 --> 2643.42
on the early bridge that would be pretty

2641.44 --> 2645.9
cool yeah

2643.42 --> 2645.9
real

2648.52 --> 2652.8
but I don't know if that's really gonna

2650.319 --> 2652.8
happen though

2652.859 --> 2658.18
but maybe yeah maybe it will be coming

2655.48 --> 2661.119
like a publicly available tool

2658.18 --> 2662.6189999999997
or like viable you'd probably have to

2661.119 --> 2667.619
buy it off

2662.619 --> 2667.619
Owen or whoever's handling that

2670.42 --> 2674.619
but yeah I would be it would be pretty

2673.119 --> 2677.8
awesome to have

2674.619 --> 2680.079
a system like that available

2677.8 --> 2683.2000000000003
and if it could like

2680.079 --> 2686.079
get the input

2683.2 --> 2690.8799999999997
similar to like uh what is it again like

2686.079 --> 2692.5
how Odyssey basically Auto loads the

2690.88 --> 2694.54
videos

2692.5 --> 2696.819
well if you could like have a Migo

2694.54 --> 2699.9
nickel program that could literally like

2696.819 --> 2699.9
do that it's like okay

2700.38 --> 2707.38
this Channel and it's like every video

2703.119 --> 2710.1400000000003
on that channel gets cataloged analyzed

2707.38 --> 2712.2000000000003
with just gigantic amount of work by the

2710.14 --> 2712.2
way

2713.2 --> 2719.68
I mean large that's probably gonna like

2715.66 --> 2723.46
require a fee to do it it's like oh yeah

2719.68 --> 2724.72
I'd like to you to analyze uh 2 000

2723.46 --> 2726.28
shows

2724.72 --> 2727.5989999999997
of

2726.28 --> 2729.7000000000003
like

2727.599 --> 2733.9
one to three hours

2729.7 --> 2736.72
yeah that's that's gonna take

2733.9 --> 2738.94
a lot of processing power

2736.72 --> 2741.339
but I mean once it's done that's

2738.94 --> 2745.96
freaking awesome man now you have like a

2741.339 --> 2748.359
database thing it's like a database

2745.96 --> 2751.3
yeah it is literally a database a

2748.359 --> 2753.7599999999998
database of all my work like that that

2751.3 --> 2756.28
you could just look things up

2753.76 --> 2759.3390000000004
that would be pretty epic and you guys

2756.28 --> 2761.7400000000002
would be absolutely astounded

2759.339 --> 2763.359
and you'll see that every time I say

2761.74 --> 2768.0989999999997
like yeah I've been talking about this

2763.359 --> 2769.9
in 2016 or 17 or 20 then yeah that's

2768.099 --> 2772.7200000000003
absolutely true now a lot of you

2769.9 --> 2777.06
actually know because you were also

2772.72 --> 2777.06
there when it happened that helps

2777.099 --> 2781.96
but yeah other people they don't know

2779.8 --> 2784.48
they're they're not really too sure and

2781.96 --> 2786.2200000000003
they might either just trust me

2784.48 --> 2788.92
but that doesn't mean that they actually

2786.22 --> 2791.2
know it it's true

2788.92 --> 2794.26
unless they're like really curious and

2791.2 --> 2796.839
like I have to know it for myself and

2794.26 --> 2798.8190000000004
then they actually follow my leads and

2796.839 --> 2802.119
try to find it

2798.819 --> 2805.3
on my YouTube channel by just manually

2802.119 --> 2808.54
searching it which is kind of tiresome

2805.3 --> 2811.2400000000002
right and they will know

2808.54 --> 2814.42
but yeah a megal

2811.24 --> 2815.68
nego system would make that a lot

2814.42 --> 2819.04
quicker

2815.68 --> 2820.96
so yeah if that becomes like a a viable

2819.04 --> 2824.2799999999997
tool at some point

2820.96 --> 2824.28
that's worth considering

2824.8 --> 2827.8590000000004
although it might be very expensive

2826.9 --> 2831.78
though

2827.859 --> 2831.7799999999997
when they've eventually sell it

2833.56 --> 2838.119
or maybe not maybe it's a really cheap

2835.96 --> 2842.4
tool maybe they're gonna like

2838.119 --> 2842.4
throw it out as freeware who knows

2844.73 --> 2848.619
[Music]

2846.099 --> 2850.78
I mean it is a tool that is very

2848.619 --> 2851.92
advantageous to those who speak the

2850.78 --> 2853.2400000000002
truth

2851.92 --> 2855.04
right

2853.24 --> 2857.0789999999997
because everything could be immediately

2855.04 --> 2858.94
checked

2857.079 --> 2861.54
so

2858.94 --> 2863.98
everybody's really good at actually

2861.54 --> 2867.04
honestly telling the truth

2863.98 --> 2869.859
it would be an advantage to them and

2867.04 --> 2872.56
people that like manipulate your life to

2869.859 --> 2874.06
you a little bit leaning on that you're

2872.56 --> 2876.94
gonna forget

2874.06 --> 2877.839
those people yeah they don't want niggle

2876.94 --> 2880.42
because

2877.839 --> 2883.7999999999997
they'll they'll just expose how they're

2880.42 --> 2883.8
wrong and lying all the time

2885.4 --> 2892.78
so yeah it would be

2889.119 --> 2894.4
a Godly thing like a good thing if it

2892.78 --> 2898.0
were freeware because it would really

2894.4 --> 2900.28
only help the good the good and the

2898.0 --> 2904.68
truthful

2900.28 --> 2904.6800000000003
right we'll see what they're gonna do

2925.18 --> 2931.24
wisdom is the application of knowledge

2927.52 --> 2934.599
yeah well that's one way of saying it

2931.24 --> 2936.9399999999996
that's the uh what's his name again

2934.599 --> 2940.1400000000003
the quote from the

2936.94 --> 2940.14
Mark Twain quote

2942.04 --> 2947.44
well in my view wisdom

2944.92 --> 2950.26
is a little different

2947.44 --> 2953.7000000000003
because in my view wisdom is like a

2950.26 --> 2953.7000000000003
counter opposite

2953.819 --> 2960.94
Spectrum ability it's like a counter

2957.4 --> 2962.38
opposite within a spectrum of ability

2960.94 --> 2964.66
versus

2962.38 --> 2967.1400000000003
Insight you have insight and you have

2964.66 --> 2967.14
wisdom

2967.42 --> 2972.099
and inside

2969.16 --> 2975.7599999999998
is also intelligence is seeing patterns

2972.099 --> 2977.8590000000004
but right if you don't have patterns to

2975.76 --> 2980.6800000000003
compare then you can see the patterns

2977.859 --> 2984.04
but you don't know what they are

2980.68 --> 2986.74
and that's where wisdom comes with age

2984.04 --> 2988.839
because you have compared it you've seen

2986.74 --> 2990.8799999999997
things happen even if you didn't think

2988.839 --> 2993.819
they were eventful or interesting at the

2990.88 --> 2997.06
time you still get to experience it

2993.819 --> 2999.7599999999998
and store that happening

2997.06 --> 3003.119
and then later or even subconsciously

2999.76 --> 3005.099
analyze what happened there

3003.119 --> 3007.319
even if you were not consciously

3005.099 --> 3009.3
interested in what was happening there's

3007.319 --> 3013.4
still stuff being recorded to your

3009.3 --> 3016.38
subconscious that is being used for

3013.4 --> 3018.48
cross-referencing things

3016.38 --> 3020.339
right because a lot more things actually

3018.48 --> 3023.099
happen in your conscious especially

3020.339 --> 3024.66
socially interacting experiences then

3023.099 --> 3026.339
you're consciously aware of there's a

3024.66 --> 3028.7999999999997
lot more things happening playing out

3026.339 --> 3032.46
than you have attention for

3028.8 --> 3035.94
that once you get the attention for that

3032.46 --> 3037.319
you can look back and then still find

3035.94 --> 3039.3
that data

3037.319 --> 3041.64
you see

3039.3 --> 3045.119
even though you were not consciously

3041.64 --> 3046.859
aware of it at the time

3045.119 --> 3049.92
and that's

3046.859 --> 3052.5589999999997
that's how interesting that works

3049.92 --> 3054.3
that's really where what wisdom that's

3052.559 --> 3056.88
where that comes from it's the ability

3054.3 --> 3059.099
to cross-reference

3056.88 --> 3061.38
things

3059.099 --> 3063.9
but to cross-reference things you need

3061.38 --> 3066.42
the experience you need to have the time

3063.9 --> 3069.3
you need to have done the things made

3066.42 --> 3071.339
the mistakes made did it correct seen

3069.3 --> 3073.92
other people make the mistakes and then

3071.339 --> 3077.339
see them corrected and then realize how

3073.92 --> 3080.099
that process works with everybody

3077.339 --> 3082.98
see now you didn't only undergo it but

3080.099 --> 3086.04
you rip cross-referenced it with others

3082.98 --> 3089.339
so you spotted consistencies by

3086.04 --> 3092.22
cross-rex referencing their growth curve

3089.339 --> 3094.0789999999997
to your growth curve

3092.22 --> 3095.7599999999998
now you get a more Universal

3094.079 --> 3100.559
understanding

3095.76 --> 3105.44
see that's wisdom it comes directly from

3100.559 --> 3105.44
more experience to cross-reference

3105.48 --> 3110.52
that it's inevitable when you get older

3108.119 --> 3113.099
unless you literally mutilate your

3110.52 --> 3117.78
Consciousness just do not

3113.099 --> 3119.339
face reality you will build wisdom it is

3117.78 --> 3122.94
inevitable

3119.339 --> 3124.92
like even when you're not smart

3122.94 --> 3127.68
you will still have all those

3124.92 --> 3130.7400000000002
experiences cross-reference you won't

3127.68 --> 3132.48
see as much in it those experiences when

3130.74 --> 3134.04
you look back because you don't have the

3132.48 --> 3136.98
intelligence

3134.04 --> 3139.619
but you'll still know roughly how things

3136.98 --> 3142.02
go you will actually get an Insight on

3139.619 --> 3143.94
how smart people function even if you

3142.02 --> 3145.98
can't follow them you'll still know how

3143.94 --> 3147.48
they are because even if you're not

3145.98 --> 3151.559
smart you will still be able to

3147.48 --> 3154.079
understand how smart people function

3151.559 --> 3155.88
right now that's an interesting thing

3154.079 --> 3159.78
isn't it

3155.88 --> 3162.599
as a dumb person you can still learn to

3159.78 --> 3165.3
understand how smart people work

3162.599 --> 3167.28
even though you can't follow them

3165.3 --> 3169.44
and here's the funniest part the most

3167.28 --> 3170.8190000000004
ironic part is that it could be a really

3169.44 --> 3176.16
smart person

3170.819 --> 3178.74
yet how you function can elude you your

3176.16 --> 3181.6189999999997
entire life and that's where a dumb

3178.74 --> 3183.839
person can actually outsmart a smart

3181.619 --> 3187.44
person because guess what a lot of smart

3183.839 --> 3190.7999999999997
person people have this tendency

3187.44 --> 3193.26
to hold on too much

3190.8 --> 3197.94
the over Focus

3193.26 --> 3200.1800000000003
they over specialize and thereby lose

3197.94 --> 3202.44
abilities that are relatively

3200.18 --> 3204.4199999999996
rudimentary to the rest of the world

3202.44 --> 3206.579
it's like you get the geek syndrome you

3204.42 --> 3209.579
get these super good at a certain thing

3206.579 --> 3212.3390000000004
and I mean like robotic Perfection like

3209.579 --> 3214.6800000000003
a Terminator Perfection but like when it

3212.339 --> 3217.859
comes to like regular interaction you're

3214.68 --> 3219.18
like uh I don't really know how to do

3217.859 --> 3221.52
that

3219.18 --> 3226.339
right nerd syndrome

3221.52 --> 3226.339
excessive intelligence over Focus

3226.38 --> 3231.6600000000003
and a rudimentary person that's not

3229.14 --> 3234.9
super smart

3231.66 --> 3237.72
like a wife or something right I mean

3234.9 --> 3239.46
they could just get those people way

3237.72 --> 3241.9199999999996
better than they get themselves even

3239.46 --> 3244.5
though those people are super smart and

3241.92 --> 3246.78
can do things really

3244.5 --> 3249.359
perfectly

3246.78 --> 3251.1600000000003
that the the less smart person just

3249.359 --> 3252.7799999999997
doesn't even understand how that works

3251.16 --> 3254.94
at all it's just like art to them it's

3252.78 --> 3257.3390000000004
like a miracle that happens like whoa

3254.94 --> 3259.319
it's like you're like painting with math

3257.339 --> 3260.94
or something it's amazing looking but I

3259.319 --> 3263.16
don't understand

3260.94 --> 3265.02
but they do understand how the person

3263.16 --> 3267.2999999999997
works

3265.02 --> 3268.38
and the smart person understands exactly

3267.3 --> 3269.88
what they're doing when they're doing

3268.38 --> 3272.7000000000003
the numbers and it's like yeah yeah and

3269.88 --> 3275.2200000000003
all this potential that potential this

3272.7 --> 3278.9399999999996
but they could barely handle themselves

3275.22 --> 3283.52
in the world yeah

3278.94 --> 3283.52
wisdom versus intelligence

3284.76 --> 3292.0400000000004
so a person that isn't very intelligent

3287.339 --> 3292.04
can still build plenty of wisdom

3292.2 --> 3299.5789999999997
an intelligent person can be

3296.52 --> 3302.94
so intelligent that they

3299.579 --> 3306.7400000000002
over focus and then actually not attain

3302.94 --> 3306.7400000000002
rudimentary wisdom because

3306.96 --> 3310.16
they have over Focus

3311.579 --> 3316.079
or they're they're like they become over

3313.92 --> 3318.059
compensating with their with their

3316.079 --> 3320.94
perfection skill

3318.059 --> 3325.099
and then ignore the really basic things

3320.94 --> 3325.099
because they're kind of scared about it

3325.26 --> 3329.7000000000003
you know in a sense that happened to me

3327.359 --> 3331.98
in a way when I was young because I

3329.7 --> 3333.4199999999996
figured out I was super intelligent very

3331.98 --> 3335.4
quickly

3333.42 --> 3336.359
and my parents were really praising

3335.4 --> 3338.76
about it

3336.359 --> 3342.42
but

3338.76 --> 3344.5200000000004
I had a lot of like sensitivity and

3342.42 --> 3346.2000000000003
thereby emotional issues that came with

3344.52 --> 3348.72
it

3346.2 --> 3350.7599999999998
it was complicated

3348.72 --> 3354.0589999999997
and difficult at times because I would

3350.76 --> 3355.98
also get frustrated and rebellious

3354.059 --> 3359.4
like if I feel like things are going

3355.98 --> 3361.98
wrong I could really like brace

3359.4 --> 3366.92
really badly

3361.98 --> 3366.92
it's like no no I'm not doing that no

3367.38 --> 3371.52
and it's weird because some people

3369.059 --> 3373.6800000000003
thought I was [ __ ] because of that

3371.52 --> 3375.42
literally because of that behavior they

3373.68 --> 3377.7
thought I was [ __ ]

3375.42 --> 3380.88
when in actuality I was [ __ ]

3377.7 --> 3384.2999999999997
brilliant I just didn't have

3380.88 --> 3386.7000000000003
control over dealing with my feelings I

3384.3 --> 3389.52
had control over Insight I didn't have

3386.7 --> 3392.5789999999997
control over my feelings and how to deal

3389.52 --> 3395.099
with them and the rest of the world

3392.579 --> 3397.5
and I used my intelligence to escape

3395.099 --> 3401.2200000000003
from it to feel good about myself being

3397.5 --> 3405.119
so smart but thereby not really working

3401.22 --> 3407.819
on my social skills and thus I've never

3405.119 --> 3411.3
really become a star at social skills

3407.819 --> 3415.64
it's infinite like I am not I really

3411.3 --> 3415.6400000000003
hold on to like trying to be gentlemanly

3416.339 --> 3421.14
but it's also because

3419.04 --> 3424.619
that's just the best thing I can do with

3421.14 --> 3427.5589999999997
it because I just I'm not very developed

3424.619 --> 3429.54
I don't have a thing that I do

3427.559 --> 3432.119
typically and I feel like really good

3429.54 --> 3433.2599999999998
doing it among other people I don't have

3432.119 --> 3435.359
that

3433.26 --> 3437.1600000000003
for me that's the waiter role that's me

3435.359 --> 3440.339
that's cleaning up the [ __ ] that's

3437.16 --> 3443.2799999999997
cleaning up the glasses and

3440.339 --> 3444.48
cooking and like making sure everybody's

3443.28 --> 3447.78
all right

3444.48 --> 3450.42
that's kind of the role that I then do

3447.78 --> 3452.94
is because I just never really developed

3450.42 --> 3455.339
socializing I only developed talking

3452.94 --> 3459.059
about my ideas

3455.339 --> 3463.38
and getting better at language to try to

3459.059 --> 3466.44
explain those complex ideas to make my

3463.38 --> 3468.6600000000003
complexity more palatable right and

3466.44 --> 3470.04
that's why I'm so good at that because

3468.66 --> 3475.8799999999997
it all came

3470.04 --> 3475.88
on top of my focus on my main focus

3477.059 --> 3483.42
and it seems probably that it is sort of

3480.839 --> 3485.16
replacing the social skill but if I'm

3483.42 --> 3486.3
like out there and there's just people

3485.16 --> 3490.0789999999997
around

3486.3 --> 3493.5
I am not this fluid

3490.079 --> 3495.7200000000003
because I'm explaining now I'm really

3493.5 --> 3499.819
comfortable in that row I'm really used

3495.72 --> 3499.819
to doing that got a lot of com

3502.02 --> 3504.859
are we still

3506.7 --> 3511.0789999999997
ah you're still alive

3509.16 --> 3513.839
what the [ __ ] was that

3511.079 --> 3516.2400000000002
it happened again

3513.839 --> 3518.66
I didn't even do anything to stop at

3516.24 --> 3518.66
this time

3520.98 --> 3525.599
right but anyway I was in the middle of

3523.44 --> 3528.059
a train of thinking and then YouTube

3525.599 --> 3530.54
almost destroyed that thanks a [ __ ]

3528.059 --> 3530.5400000000004
lot YouTube

3533.28 --> 3538.26
I'm over focused at explanation

3536.28 --> 3539.8190000000004
and I'm good at making things

3538.26 --> 3542.7000000000003
comprehensible

3539.819 --> 3546.359
really good with language to achieve

3542.7 --> 3548.52
that task so I feel purpose within that

3546.359 --> 3551.9
task of making things comprehensible I'm

3548.52 --> 3551.9
a natural teacher at that

3552.02 --> 3558.54
but outside of that

3556.02 --> 3561.42
like what I typically talk about with

3558.54 --> 3562.319
other people usually is like about the

3561.42 --> 3565.079
weather

3562.319 --> 3567.98
or about the quality of the product or

3565.079 --> 3567.98
something and

3568.02 --> 3572.16
that's it

3570.48 --> 3578.48
I am not

3572.16 --> 3580.0789999999997
super elaborate on like socializing

3578.48 --> 3581.88
infrastructure

3580.079 --> 3584.3390000000004
social yeah

3581.88 --> 3586.92
like what do you do when you communicate

3584.339 --> 3589.0789999999997
with other people I mean I'm not like an

3586.92 --> 3591.96
autistic retarder so it's not like a

3589.079 --> 3595.8590000000004
complete like er I don't know how to

3591.96 --> 3598.5
talk I'm not that bad it's just that my

3595.859 --> 3601.5589999999997
dad my dad's really interesting he's

3598.5 --> 3603.78
always had this my dad is specialist in

3601.559 --> 3604.8590000000004
that specific thing that I don't know

3603.78 --> 3606.599
how to do

3604.859 --> 3607.799
it's really weird because when we're

3606.599 --> 3609.1800000000003
together

3607.799 --> 3612.18
it's like

3609.18 --> 3614.3999999999996
I'm like hyper talking like I'm doing

3612.18 --> 3616.44
now I'm explaining heavy things and he's

3614.4 --> 3617.819
like really fascinated when I do that

3616.44 --> 3621.78
because

3617.819 --> 3624.839
he's never done that like my dad is

3621.78 --> 3627.059
really bad at doing what I do and I'm

3624.839 --> 3630.42
really bad at doing what my dad does

3627.059 --> 3632.059
because my dad can literally walk up to

3630.42 --> 3634.98
anybody

3632.059 --> 3639.78
and get them to like him

3634.98 --> 3644.04
anybody and I mean anybody any class any

3639.78 --> 3646.8590000000004
age he really knows how to like

3644.04 --> 3649.14
be likable

3646.859 --> 3650.819
stay in socializing start a conversation

3649.14 --> 3653.7599999999998
on any level

3650.819 --> 3656.52
I don't really know how to do that

3653.76 --> 3659.099
I mean I only know how to do that when

3656.52 --> 3660.839
I'm like super gushing with confidence

3659.099 --> 3663.48
which is kind of rare that it even

3660.839 --> 3665.52
happens in public or like I just take

3663.48 --> 3667.44
took alcohol but then I might still

3665.52 --> 3671.119
sound like an ass

3667.44 --> 3671.119
but it doesn't matter anymore then

3671.94 --> 3675.599
to me right

3676.799 --> 3680.04
but it's kind of funny how me and my dad

3678.66 --> 3682.92
are like

3680.04 --> 3684.299
exactly opposite in our in our Focus

3682.92 --> 3688.079
skills

3684.299 --> 3691.819
he's really good at socializing

3688.079 --> 3691.819
and not really good at

3691.92 --> 3696.839
oversight pictures and making them

3694.319 --> 3700.859
understood he's okay with it but he's

3696.839 --> 3702.66
like even with his medical Focus like he

3700.859 --> 3704.16
doesn't like to explain it because he

3702.66 --> 3707.22
finds it tiresome he's just not very

3704.16 --> 3710.22
good I can never shut the [ __ ] up about

3707.22 --> 3713.4599999999996
trying to explain things

3710.22 --> 3716.16
but like when you take me along when my

3713.46 --> 3718.619
dad takes me along it's like hey

3716.16 --> 3723.5989999999997
there's a new person then he's like oh

3718.619 --> 3726.1800000000003
oh yeah it's me again like oh oh [ __ ] uh

3723.599 --> 3728.88
not literally like that but the feel of

3726.18 --> 3731.22
it he knows like oh [ __ ] a new person oh

3728.88 --> 3733.2000000000003
now that means our win is gonna kind of

3731.22 --> 3737.8799999999997
brace it's like oh [ __ ] I have to be

3733.2 --> 3739.4399999999996
presentable for normal people oh [ __ ]

3737.88 --> 3742.079
right

3739.44 --> 3744.98
so we're exactly the opposite in that

3742.079 --> 3744.98
sense what's this

3749.35 --> 3755.7
[Music]

3753.78 --> 3757.5
uh you could have left that that's just

3755.7 --> 3761.0989999999997
funny

3757.5 --> 3763.98
vulture of Lies oh man

3761.099 --> 3768.42
Arwin you are saying dumb folk and

3763.98 --> 3771.299
outsmart intelligent people yet hear you

3768.42 --> 3773.96
a failure not a complete English

3771.299 --> 3773.96
sentence

3776.24 --> 3780.7799999999997
thank you

3779.339 --> 3783.72
like

3780.78 --> 3784.619
that sentence didn't actually make any

3783.72 --> 3788.0
sense

3784.619 --> 3788.0
when you really think about it

3789.48 --> 3793.7400000000002
it set the f word

3791.28 --> 3795.78
a little failure

3793.74 --> 3797.8799999999997
failure is an F word

3795.78 --> 3799.799
it was a gamma comment anyway and it

3797.88 --> 3801.48
doesn't make any [ __ ] sense

3799.799 --> 3803.099
so it's like a troll comment but it's

3801.48 --> 3804.839
kind of fascinating me because it

3803.099 --> 3807.559
literally doesn't make any sense I'll

3804.839 --> 3807.5589999999997
repost it

3809.2 --> 3814.339
[Music]

3810.359 --> 3814.339
so you can see what he said

3816.78 --> 3822.42
I am a failure making fun of others

3820.2 --> 3825.9199999999996
really

3822.42 --> 3825.92
who am I making fun of

3833.04 --> 3837.96
I didn't know that that's a typical

3835.2 --> 3841.319
occupation I had

3837.96 --> 3843.54
I thought I mostly tried to avoid

3841.319 --> 3845.94
making fun of other people

3843.54 --> 3848.099
because I find it less productive I only

3845.94 --> 3852.02
really do it out of self-defense when

3848.099 --> 3852.02
somebody's going nuts or ballistic

3871.319 --> 3876.299
a month to the Moon they decorated on

3873.72 --> 3881.52
slower oh no no Jordan it's very simple

3876.299 --> 3884.819
they just took a wider orbit trajectory

3881.52 --> 3886.859
so that the slingshot would be wider and

3884.819 --> 3888.9
I don't know less risky or blah blah

3886.859 --> 3890.339
blah whatever if it takes longer it's

3888.9 --> 3893.42
just because they're taking a wider

3890.339 --> 3893.42
orbit to get there

3894.96 --> 3899.2400000000002
that's not a difficult question to

3897.059 --> 3899.2400000000002
answer

3900.66 --> 3904.339
the scenic route red

3904.559 --> 3911.4
just for a change yeah or maybe

3908.099 --> 3915.6800000000003
ever realized that maybe just the way

3911.4 --> 3915.6800000000003
things are divided changes over time

3921.54 --> 3925.619
right maybe the bending of space-time

3923.88 --> 3928.619
changes

3925.619 --> 3930.7200000000003
right that like the Moon and the Sun and

3928.619 --> 3933.42
the Earth they're all still seeming at

3930.72 --> 3935.9399999999996
the exact same distance but maybe the

3933.42 --> 3938.88
property of space between them is

3935.94 --> 3941.7000000000003
actually changing so that the distance

3938.88 --> 3945.0
is actually the same but the way space

3941.7 --> 3946.799
behaves in which all those things are

3945.0 --> 3948.359
become different

3946.799 --> 3951.24
right I mean you're dealing with

3948.359 --> 3953.7599999999998
space-time bending gravity

3951.24 --> 3955.74
we don't know the full nature of

3953.76 --> 3959.6400000000003
space-time bending gravity

3955.74 --> 3963.24
and if black holes can exist

3959.64 --> 3964.98
and literally like be like a hole in the

3963.24 --> 3967.5589999999997
third dimension then

3964.98 --> 3969.78
well why would that be the only instance

3967.559 --> 3972.1800000000003
in which space becomes non-linear

3969.78 --> 3974.6600000000003
because of space-time bending

3972.18 --> 3974.66
right

3978.54 --> 3984.9
so maybe the trajectory

3982.2 --> 3988.6189999999997
was always the same type of trajectory

3984.9 --> 3991.799
except now the space has become

3988.619 --> 3995.7000000000003
more condensed so that the distance

3991.799 --> 3998.94
becomes longer even though within

3995.7 --> 4002.0589999999997
euclidean space it is the same

3998.94 --> 4004.76
trajectory ever thought of that

4002.059 --> 4006.6800000000003
yeah and by the way I just took this

4004.76 --> 4009.8590000000004
into complete

4006.68 --> 4011.98
Narnia fuckwittery just so for the

4009.859 --> 4011.98
record

4021.92 --> 4027.02
this row does not happen yeah well why

4024.799 --> 4028.94
would it need a big rocket

4027.02 --> 4031.16
I mean the Americans only use big

4028.94 --> 4035.42
Rockets because of the Showmanship of it

4031.16 --> 4037.7
you don't need huge Rockets yeah

4035.42 --> 4039.54
you only need huge Rockets if you have

4037.7 --> 4042.7999999999997
huge deposits

4039.54 --> 4042.8
[Music]

4048.68 --> 4053.72
all right and if you do it really well

4051.02 --> 4056.14
you even can get rockets that don't use

4053.72 --> 4056.14
fuel

4063.5 --> 4066.88
right iom Drive

4067.22 --> 4072.5589999999997
like an ion drive propulsion system you

4070.52 --> 4074.42
could literally just let that up with a

4072.559 --> 4077.599
balloon

4074.42 --> 4079.28
and then when it's high up enough and

4077.599 --> 4080.9
the gravity becomes less or whatever

4079.28 --> 4084.02
space-time betting

4080.9 --> 4086.2400000000002
like it reaches outer space then the ion

4084.02 --> 4088.579
propulsion can just take over like why

4086.24 --> 4090.9799999999996
the hell would you even need all this

4088.579 --> 4093.94
combustion based propulsion other than

4090.98 --> 4093.94
for the spectacle

4096.62 --> 4100.599999999999
for your deep inner you better believe

4098.359 --> 4100.6
it

4102.1 --> 4109.42
see this is proper Narnia magic this is

4106.64 --> 4109.42
how you do it

4111.679 --> 4116.799
not this incoherent [ __ ] whining

4124.04 --> 4129.44
that's why I block everyone

4127.16 --> 4131.62
well I what the [ __ ] are you blabbering

4129.44 --> 4131.62
about

4133.52 --> 4139.580000000001
what will I do when I realize well what

4136.16 --> 4143.62
the [ __ ] are you whining about you [ __ ]

4139.58 --> 4143.62
no I don't block everyone because

4143.66 --> 4146.44
what

4146.719 --> 4149.9800000000005
the challenge

4152.48 --> 4159.8589999999995
English is not your first language is it

4156.799 --> 4162.319
you sound like a [ __ ] you can barely

4159.859 --> 4165.219
speak go in here in sentences there if

4162.319 --> 4165.219
alter your lies

4168.109 --> 4171.309
[Music]

4178.31 --> 4182.96
[Music]

4184.0 --> 4191.12
Israel needs a lot wider yes

4187.94 --> 4193.759
but I mean so I take that Israel is not

4191.12 --> 4196.16
having human occupants right because

4193.759 --> 4198.199
that's part of it too think of it

4196.16 --> 4200.62
logically okay

4198.199 --> 4203.239
if it's just a bunch of electronics

4200.62 --> 4206.42
you're sending there

4203.239 --> 4209.599999999999
all you need is a battery

4206.42 --> 4211.16
literally all you need is a battery

4209.6 --> 4215.3
and

4211.16 --> 4218.12
yeah why not let it take 42 days right

4215.3 --> 4224.320000000001
if you're sending people

4218.12 --> 4230.0
well then three days 42 days is it

4224.32 --> 4230.0
extreme difference because person

4230.179 --> 4236.06
needs to breathe

4233.6 --> 4237.679
drink eat

4236.06 --> 4240.620000000001
poo

4237.679 --> 4242.4800000000005
yeah

4240.62 --> 4248.0599999999995
uh

4242.48 --> 4250.459999999999
has weight to them also needs to return

4248.06 --> 4252.92
so yeah

4250.46 --> 4255.86
it's more logical to then just like

4252.92 --> 4258.26
basically put a controlled stick a

4255.86 --> 4260.179
dynamite and just literally blow them

4258.26 --> 4263.84
straight to the Moon as quickly as

4260.179 --> 4266.179
possible because if it took 42 days it

4263.84 --> 4269.54
would like the capsule would have been

4266.179 --> 4272.36
would be insane would have to be like

4269.54 --> 4274.82
insanely large just to be able to

4272.36 --> 4277.699
accommodate them unless they're willing

4274.82 --> 4279.86
to for that short of time go into like

4277.699 --> 4281.9
stasis

4279.86 --> 4283.639999999999
which is extremely risky and no

4281.9 --> 4285.799999999999
guarantee you'll actually wake up and if

4283.64 --> 4287.6
you're a critical component

4285.8 --> 4288.9800000000005
for the operation to work you can't

4287.6 --> 4291.620000000001
really risk that

4288.98 --> 4294.44
so yeah if you're going to fly to the

4291.62 --> 4298.28
moon you better basically go straight at

4294.44 --> 4300.199
it if you have human occupants

4298.28 --> 4302.179
but if you got a robot yeah it doesn't

4300.199 --> 4305.678999999999
matter how long it's gonna take as long

4302.179 --> 4305.679
as you have enough battery time

4306.02 --> 4309.38
that's it

4307.64 --> 4311.54
save a lot of weight

4309.38 --> 4313.64
right and even also even talked about

4311.54 --> 4315.5
this in the 90s it's like yeah in the

4313.64 --> 4317.54
future we have robots and it'll be so

4315.5 --> 4320.36
much more efficient because that's

4317.54 --> 4324.26
technically true

4320.36 --> 4327.5
because a human is a big thing it has a

4324.26 --> 4329.4800000000005
lot of issues and maintenance robots

4327.5 --> 4332.12
don't

4329.48 --> 4334.759999999999
but I mean if you want to make space

4332.12 --> 4335.96
travel real you can't just let it all be

4334.76 --> 4339.52
robots

4335.96 --> 4339.52
that's just [ __ ] lame

4347.36 --> 4353.32
oh wow

4349.76 --> 4353.320000000001
that's a blast from the past

4354.44 --> 4358.299999999999
I guess you know me quite a while

4359.0 --> 4362.9
how I time traveled and saved Humanity

4361.34 --> 4365.06
yeah

4362.9 --> 4367.219
I could to talk about it regularly

4365.06 --> 4369.679
although the saving Humanity part I've

4367.219 --> 4370.699
never been entirely certain of that part

4369.679 --> 4373.4
though

4370.699 --> 4375.62
I thought I was though I thought I was

4373.4 --> 4378.44
definitely in in the process of those

4375.62 --> 4382.04
Dark World Visions I definitely thought

4378.44 --> 4384.919999999999
or rather it was the driving force that

4382.04 --> 4386.9
pulled me through it and steered me

4384.92 --> 4390.32
was

4386.9 --> 4393.339999999999
My Hope and my vision that I was trying

4390.32 --> 4393.34
to save Humanity

4397.219 --> 4404.5
and and prevent a cataclysmic War event

4401.0 --> 4404.5
but also since then

4407.179 --> 4413.14
well

4408.62 --> 4413.14
I may have simply only postponed it

4414.98 --> 4420.62
but yes there wasn't a gigantic Paradigm

4417.98 --> 4422.48
within my Dark World Visions CEO vulture

4420.62 --> 4425.0
of Lies he thinks it's so funny ringing

4422.48 --> 4426.919999999999
that up oh so ridiculous yeah yeah but

4425.0 --> 4429.14
that's actually a real serious thing in

4426.92 --> 4430.58
my Visions I haven't talked about it in

4429.14 --> 4432.56
a while

4430.58 --> 4435.739
but yes

4432.56 --> 4438.9800000000005
there was a paradigm in which to me was

4435.739 --> 4441.379999999999
presented two eventual outcomes

4438.98 --> 4443.48
that could happen

4441.38 --> 4446.32
and which we're kind of Doom is like how

4443.48 --> 4449.36
the world will end one of them would

4446.32 --> 4451.28
guys this sounds really silly to me but

4449.36 --> 4453.799999999999
you got to realize when I saw these

4451.28 --> 4458.42
things I had no idea who these people

4453.8 --> 4461.54
were that I wasn't into politics okay

4458.42 --> 4463.58
I got two options to see one

4461.54 --> 4465.92
was

4463.58 --> 4467.6
the only one I even recognized there was

4465.92 --> 4468.5
like Hillary Clinton but it was probably

4467.6 --> 4470.3
like

4468.5 --> 4472.52
more people

4470.3 --> 4474.8
that would be like

4472.52 --> 4476.84
on top of things it would basically be

4474.8 --> 4479.900000000001
like Hillary Clinton rules the world

4476.84 --> 4483.26
with liberals and they would gayify

4479.9 --> 4485.599999999999
everything and it would all collapse

4483.26 --> 4487.34
relatively quickly

4485.6 --> 4490.58
the other one

4487.34 --> 4493.159000000001
was another option in which

4490.58 --> 4497.679
there would be

4493.159 --> 4502.099999999999
more pushback against that and in which

4497.679 --> 4504.86
Putin had a very prominent place in that

4502.1 --> 4507.56
picture in the other option

4504.86 --> 4509.0
and without any hesitation I chose that

4507.56 --> 4511.219
option

4509.0 --> 4513.92
because the other one was pure hell it

4511.219 --> 4515.84
was like exactly the opposite of

4513.92 --> 4517.9400000000005
everything that I want in life

4515.84 --> 4520.34
would be it's like it was liberal hell

4517.94 --> 4523.04
it would be human extinguishment and

4520.34 --> 4526.54
liberal health and the one in what which

4523.04 --> 4526.54
Putin was more prominent

4526.699 --> 4534.08
it would be more war related

4531.08 --> 4536.42
but the only even virtual threat within

4534.08 --> 4540.82
that would be a nuclear destruction

4536.42 --> 4540.82
which literally doesn't exist

4541.04 --> 4546.5
but if an end in that sense would be

4544.699 --> 4549.32
more an indication that there would be

4546.5 --> 4551.96
like a World War type

4549.32 --> 4554.599999999999
fire bombing at places and things would

4551.96 --> 4557.6
be destroyed and peoples would be wiped

4554.6 --> 4559.52
out unexpectedly and [ __ ] like so that's

4557.6 --> 4561.92
the trajectory we're going which would

4559.52 --> 4564.1990000000005
be much longer lasting

4561.92 --> 4569.4400000000005
because the other option

4564.199 --> 4569.44
would be we'd all be already dead by now

4571.94 --> 4578.0199999999995
because in that option vaccines would be

4575.3 --> 4578.02
mandatory

4578.06 --> 4582.38
and people

4579.56 --> 4585.56
would really be censored and fired for

4582.38 --> 4587.12
that from their jobs like even with

4585.56 --> 4591.1990000000005
menial jobs

4587.12 --> 4595.4
if they had the wrong opinion in public

4591.199 --> 4598.0
really bad like full nightmare Sofia

4595.4 --> 4598.0
system

4600.739 --> 4605.36
like full communism worldwide from

4603.679 --> 4606.679
America yeah that would have been the

4605.36 --> 4608.9
alternative

4606.679 --> 4611.659
and that option

4608.9 --> 4613.5199999999995
was not it I got the choice and I chose

4611.659 --> 4616.219
and that's the thing that I didn't

4613.52 --> 4618.7390000000005
choose and because of that

4616.219 --> 4621.86
from the perspective of that experience

4618.739 --> 4625.339999999999
I can say that it's absolutely real

4621.86 --> 4629.42
from that perspective it seemed like I

4625.34 --> 4632.2390000000005
had given the world some breathing room

4629.42 --> 4636.08
if it was my choice to make

4632.239 --> 4639.379999999999
I don't know did I choose the reality in

4636.08 --> 4643.04
that would manifest or was it simply a

4639.38 --> 4645.4400000000005
test from God or the outside it was the

4643.04 --> 4647.6
man in Black doing that and he had a

4645.44 --> 4652.04
role of God whether it is literally God

4647.6 --> 4654.320000000001
or my construction of God I don't know

4652.04 --> 4657.14
when he gave me that choice and I chose

4654.32 --> 4659.12
now is that choice because of what I

4657.14 --> 4661.04
choose or is that literally what was

4659.12 --> 4663.199
going to happen in the world

4661.04 --> 4664.159
it seems like it's happening in the

4663.199 --> 4666.86
world

4664.159 --> 4670.4
but it could also be that it was simply

4666.86 --> 4671.96
the choice of my focus of my mind during

4670.4 --> 4675.139999999999
my waking time

4671.96 --> 4678.679
that I was choosing in the dark row

4675.14 --> 4681.679
but when I first remembered all this in

4678.679 --> 4684.38
2015 and talked about it on my show a

4681.679 --> 4686.0
little I thought I it was like yeah I

4684.38 --> 4688.4800000000005
could have potentially saved the world

4686.0 --> 4688.48
here

4691.159 --> 4696.98
I didn't think about it as carefully as

4694.04 --> 4699.38
I'm now explaining it

4696.98 --> 4703.459999999999
when first started to get back to me in

4699.38 --> 4706.46
2015. so yeah that's the reference to

4703.46 --> 4709.88
this supposed troll remarkable oh did

4706.46 --> 4713.42
you tell everybody how you saved dear

4709.88 --> 4716.06
yeah yeah so funny to them isn't it

4713.42 --> 4718.159
it's really [ __ ] serious on my side

4716.06 --> 4720.14
though it's so funny that they just

4718.159 --> 4723.259999999999
bring it up so funny

4720.14 --> 4726.320000000001
yeah yeah now I explain it really

4723.26 --> 4727.84
seriously isn't that just something

4726.32 --> 4730.94
huh

4727.84 --> 4732.860000000001
anyway I'm rounding out the show because

4730.94 --> 4735.62
it's over

4732.86 --> 4738.32
it flew by

4735.62 --> 4740.42
right so thanks everyone for coming I

4748.04 --> 4754.04

4751.219 --> 4756.9800000000005
no in my vision I never saw Putin

4754.04 --> 4759.86
without a suit on

4756.98 --> 4762.5599999999995
so please
