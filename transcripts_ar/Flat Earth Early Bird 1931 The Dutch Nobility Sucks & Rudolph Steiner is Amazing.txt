175.76 --> 180.79999999999998
humidity well I guess it's a little

178.319 --> 183.28
better than the last week

180.8 --> 185.519
says here the predictions are that the

183.28 --> 191.319
coming week is going to be warmer on

185.519 --> 191.31900000000002
average it's kind of nice between 18 and

194.959 --> 198.92000000000002
23Â° looking forward to

200.68 --> 206.76000000000002

208.959 --> 211.76
Rogan's it up

213.439 --> 216.12
when you get

235.12 --> 239.84
here Prince of rhythm

245.68 --> 252.079
with

247.36 --> 254.799
Jo what no I have not seen that is that

252.079 --> 254.799
a recent

255.04 --> 260.88
thing I don't really follow Joe Rogan

257.799 --> 264.03999999999996
that closely at all I only get to hear

260.88 --> 265.44
from people just telling me about oh

264.04 --> 270.16
there's this

265.44 --> 270.16
thing so yeah

277.03 --> 280.16999999999996
[Music]

296.4 --> 300.08
oh he's uh

303.0 --> 309.72
sa is all about the moon

306.479 --> 309.71999999999997
landings I

311.56 --> 318.96
see very

314.919 --> 321.0
recent you should watch it okay well

318.96 --> 325.59999999999997
where can I watch

321.0 --> 325.6
it I have no idea

332.6 --> 338.28000000000003
if you could email me the video link or

335.28 --> 341.35999999999996
whatever Skype it that would be great

338.28 --> 345.28
and I'll check it out maybe maybe it'll

341.36 --> 345.28000000000003
be interesting who

354.319 --> 358.6
knows all right

366.599 --> 371.56
all right so I hope everybody's doing

369.44 --> 376.639
okay

371.56 --> 381.199
it's what I could consider cursed April

376.639 --> 383.88
month is almost over and I can't wait

381.199 --> 386.52000000000004
until it's over because everything this

383.88 --> 386.52
month kind of

388.199 --> 394.0
sucked but

390.12 --> 398.759
yeah I am crawling out of

394.0 --> 398.759
it yesterday was really Rowdy

404.24 --> 411.16
day and yeah I was in a bad mood kind of

408.16 --> 411.16
during my show

411.84 --> 417.919
so ended up timing out a whole bunch of

414.599 --> 417.919
people kicking out a bunch of

418.319 --> 423.68
trolls but yeah I was just not in a good

421.28 --> 427.84
mood at all

423.68 --> 427.84000000000003
and today should be a lot

429.68 --> 436.08
better all right so before the show I

433.84 --> 438.71999999999997
actually was watching Dell for a bit

436.08 --> 441.84
from Beyond the imaginary curve he was

438.72 --> 445.52000000000004
live very odd hour for

441.84 --> 448.19899999999996
him usually starts a little

445.52 --> 451.52
later but yeah that

448.199 --> 451.52000000000004
was typ

451.639 --> 457.44
iCal he's always on about the same

454.44 --> 457.44
subject and

461.16 --> 465.44
it's he's basically in denial of

463.639 --> 467.40000000000003
relative density

465.44 --> 470.039
disequilibrium he thinks now that

467.4 --> 472.75899999999996
there's some other backdrop thing that's

470.039 --> 477.08
causing that he's like not settling for

472.759 --> 479.91900000000004
the blatant repeatable testable cause

477.08 --> 482.479
and effect relationship of relative

479.919 --> 484.44
density dise equilibrium causing the

482.479 --> 487.039
vertical

484.44 --> 488.12
displacement and even objects that are

487.039 --> 490.71999999999997
in

488.12 --> 493.44
motion while they're still abiding by

490.72 --> 497.44000000000005
the relative density disequilibrium

493.44 --> 499.52
Rules by the system but yeah if

497.44 --> 503.479
something is

499.52 --> 506.28
actively moving then there may be an AAL

503.479 --> 510.0
shift within the object as a micro

506.28 --> 514.0799999999999
medium and I've addressed all of this

510.0 --> 515.32
like tons of times even years ago it

514.08 --> 517.9190000000001
seems to

515.32 --> 519.839
just be completely unwilling to

517.919 --> 523.64
recognize that

519.839 --> 525.7600000000001
whatsoever so there's not really a point

523.64 --> 529.12
I could like explain it all over again

525.76 --> 529.12
but yeah that I'm doing that right

533.519 --> 536.519
now

538.079 --> 542.4799999999999
uh what else is happening out

568.12 --> 573.48
there uh I'm just browsing around hope

571.079 --> 578.279
you're all having a good time hello moon

573.48 --> 578.279
rover am I back with fed

583.92 --> 589.92
no why do you ask CU I showed up in the

587.36 --> 589.92
Discord

591.44 --> 597.6
yesterday that's not really me being

593.959 --> 597.5999999999999
back now is it

599.6 --> 602.6
e

631.68 --> 637.92
right I'm just looking around see if

634.24 --> 637.92
there's anything interesting

677.24 --> 686.92
right Russian strikes blowing up more

681.6 --> 686.9200000000001
Ukrainian weapons lots of it

690.04 --> 695.7199999999999
but I mean that keeps happening and I've

692.16 --> 698.88
been saying that that would happen a

695.72 --> 700.76
lot it's like oh yeah oh we support him

698.88 --> 702.519
with all this money and weaponry and

700.76 --> 705.12
then we send the weaponry and before it

702.519 --> 708.399
even gets used it just gets blown off

705.12 --> 710.519
boom and yeah that's that was going to

708.399 --> 713.12
happen it is happening it will continue

710.519 --> 713.12
happening

714.04 --> 720.88
probably it was good to have me on the

716.279 --> 720.88
FED panel well

721.399 --> 723.88
was it

726.56 --> 733.3599999999999
though just email me oh okay thanks I'll

731.0 --> 733.36
check it

738.959 --> 742.4399999999999
out it's on

748.16 --> 753.4399999999999
YouTube Jesus 3 hours

751.72 --> 756.6800000000001
ah

753.44 --> 760.0790000000001
okay that's a a bit

756.68 --> 763.12
much but I guess uh I might find the

760.079 --> 766.4799999999999
time to watch at least some of

763.12 --> 768.32
it was there anything in particular a

766.48 --> 772.32
specific

768.32 --> 775.6400000000001
moment you wanted me to uh to check

772.32 --> 777.399
out which just the whole

775.64 --> 782.0
[Music]

777.399 --> 782.0
thing it's the same every day

792.839 --> 798.72
yeah this pack with information okay

795.839 --> 801.24
well I can't watch it I can't watch it

798.72 --> 806.6
right now but I will take a look at it

801.24 --> 806.6
Prince R Rhythm thanks for the tip

811.36 --> 819.04
the whole podcast okay well maybe it

814.48 --> 821.639
will be very interesting yeah so we'll

819.04 --> 823.959
see maybe I'll get bored out of my mind

821.639 --> 823.9590000000001
I don't

824.279 --> 830.72
know but if you say it's very

827.279 --> 832.079
interesting then uh yeah it might be

830.72 --> 836.839
I'll check it

832.079 --> 836.8389999999999
out but not right now

857.0 --> 860.0
ah

875.519 --> 880.399
so yeah I feel like way better today

878.399 --> 884.48
than I did

880.399 --> 887.92
yesterday so took a much needed shower

884.48 --> 887.9200000000001
that always helps

913.48 --> 919.519
oh

914.959 --> 924.399
yeah I uh watched the

919.519 --> 929.88
uh Rebel Moon second

924.399 --> 929.88
part the rest of it very intense

933.959 --> 939.2399999999999
interesting not perfect but interesting

940.079 --> 946.319
and I thought the second movie like

942.72 --> 948.639
really had a strong flare of um what's

946.319 --> 953.88
it

948.639 --> 953.88
movie Starship Troopers a bit

960.04 --> 964.639
I said earlier that like it's a little

962.16 --> 968.959
bit like a crossover between Star Wars

964.639 --> 972.12
and Firefly the series but it also has

968.959 --> 975.279
strong elements of Starship Trooper to

972.12 --> 979.5600000000001
it and it really stood out also in this

975.279 --> 983.079
second movie that like the Empire it's

979.56 --> 985.2399999999999
not just blanket evil like they actually

983.079 --> 987.56
do care about their soldiers and all

985.24 --> 990.88
that that was interesting and that

987.56 --> 993.04
really did remind me of the Starship

990.88 --> 995.6
Troopers kind of

993.04 --> 998.7199999999999
feel so that stood out in the second

995.6 --> 1002.24
part and yeah they leave open and

998.72 --> 1005.3190000000001
another potential

1002.24 --> 1007.5600000000001
Adventure so from the looks of it there

1005.319 --> 1009.639
could definitely be a third maybe even a

1007.56 --> 1013.0
fourth movie who knows where they will

1009.639 --> 1013.0
go with it

1016.25 --> 1019.36
[Music]

1024.439 --> 1030.199
okay gy

1026.959 --> 1030.199
jackass what

1030.839 --> 1038.079
sense what point didn't you get across I

1034.6 --> 1042.039
mean it's okay I guess yesterday I was

1038.079 --> 1042.039
just in a cranky mood overall

1042.28 --> 1048.039
so I was just less tolerant

1051.16 --> 1057.2
and when I'm like that it's like not

1053.64 --> 1059.4
wise to start basically whining back or

1057.2 --> 1061.52
being complaining about it because that

1059.4 --> 1064.52
just pisses me off even

1061.52 --> 1067.799
more it happens

1064.52 --> 1069.799
it's regrettable but that is what

1067.799 --> 1073.6399999999999
happens every single

1069.799 --> 1076.039
time and my wrenches people that trust

1073.64 --> 1080.159
with wrenches like they know that about

1076.039 --> 1082.799
me like once I get cranky don't complain

1080.159 --> 1086.0390000000002
about things about my code of conduct

1082.799 --> 1086.039
like that'll only make it

1087.2 --> 1097.28
worse right but

1091.559 --> 1097.28
uh thought you were mad at me I was a

1100.84 --> 1107.6789999999999
bit but I mean it's the next

1104.679 --> 1107.679
day

1107.76 --> 1115.4
and if the behavior is not better then I

1111.76 --> 1115.4
don't really see that much of a

1125.4 --> 1130.919
problem oh hey Prince of rhythm

1141.44 --> 1147.64
was there a falling out well there was

1144.159 --> 1151.1200000000001
all kinds of things PR Prince of

1147.64 --> 1154.2
Rhythm yeah but pretty much in

1151.12 --> 1158.36
February there were falling

1154.2 --> 1158.3600000000001
outs I was kind of

1158.84 --> 1165.039
like I was a bit out of control

1162.159 --> 1169.0
emotionally I was just very angry a lot

1165.039 --> 1174.64
and frustrated stressed out

1169.0 --> 1178.6
and like too adrenal too aggressive in a

1174.64 --> 1180.8400000000001
way and like I have been frustrated with

1178.6 --> 1181.7199999999998
fed like being part of it for a very

1180.84 --> 1185.559
long

1181.72 --> 1190.32
time where I don't feel like I get the

1185.559 --> 1193.48
respect or the room that I deserve and

1190.32 --> 1195.96
and then basically they told me or

1193.48 --> 1200.039
Nathan even like told me on the show

1195.96 --> 1204.039
like I should like not let ball and die

1200.039 --> 1208.679
quote literal quote and like basically

1204.039 --> 1211.28
fall in line and do exactly as fed once

1208.679 --> 1214.48
and that was like too

1211.28 --> 1216.36
far so then I literally dropped out and

1214.48 --> 1217.919
said like okay well then I'm just going

1216.36 --> 1220.76
to do my own

1217.919 --> 1223.919
show on my own terms and do it as long

1220.76 --> 1225.76
as I want instead of quitting when fed

1223.919 --> 1227.5590000000002
is going to start and only do longer

1225.76 --> 1230.4
shows in the weekend now I do longer

1227.559 --> 1234.0
shows pretty much every

1230.4 --> 1238.3600000000001
day the new show length is kind of

1234.0 --> 1243.52
between 2 and 1 half and 3 and 1/2 hours

1238.36 --> 1246.32
now which is great because often the

1243.52 --> 1249.0
first hour is kind of slow with me it's

1246.32 --> 1251.6399999999999
just the way it is I start at 2

1249.0 --> 1255.36
p.m and a lot of the time I just have

1251.64 --> 1257.159
trouble getting into it I and it can't

1255.36 --> 1259.039
be helped like if I start later that

1257.159 --> 1262.24
would happen as well I mean I mean not

1259.039 --> 1266.1589999999999
if I start in the evening like with a

1262.24 --> 1266.159
night owl show then I have no issue at

1267.4 --> 1273.3200000000002
all okay you don't have to say it like

1270.0 --> 1277.84
that virtal virtue

1273.32 --> 1277.84
but yeah I was I was done with

1279.0 --> 1285.919
that I felt I deserved more respect than

1282.559 --> 1285.9189999999999
I was getting

1289.88 --> 1292.7600000000002
low debatable

1297.12 --> 1303.4399999999998
d right and I've left ever since uh not

1301.36 --> 1307.279
without issues though I mean I've gone

1303.44 --> 1310.0
through psychological issues a lot at a

1307.279 --> 1314.52
whole period where I was suddenly very

1310.0 --> 1318.679
paranoid like scared I had hallucination

1314.52 --> 1321.52
memories that came back to me that I've

1318.679 --> 1324.0
experienced over the years like in

1321.52 --> 1325.559
relation to people from fed it was just

1324.0 --> 1329.32
really

1325.559 --> 1333.6
freaky and they were caused by

1329.32 --> 1336.1589999999999
the peer pressure of just social

1333.6 --> 1340.559
interactions because of the group

1336.159 --> 1345.7990000000002
dynamic that sometimes arises with

1340.559 --> 1349.559
fed they're two poshy too aggressive too

1345.799 --> 1351.96
polarized in a way and now that there

1349.559 --> 1354.799
some people like that they like like

1351.96 --> 1356.8400000000001
it's like a gang fight or something

1354.799 --> 1359.679
against the anti flat earthers and I get

1356.84 --> 1361.039
it it's it can be very compelling it can

1359.679 --> 1364.1200000000001
be

1361.039 --> 1368.96
entertaining it's just a little too much

1364.12 --> 1368.9599999999998
and it was like physically unhealthy for

1370.559 --> 1379.1589999999999
me and I've like really try to adapt to

1375.32 --> 1380.559
that for a very long time for years

1379.159 --> 1384.48
to

1380.559 --> 1386.44
be like really fed

1384.48 --> 1390.32
compliant with the

1386.44 --> 1393.8400000000001
arguments and going after the anti flat

1390.32 --> 1396.24
earthers but at the same time also

1393.84 --> 1400.72
trying to be somewhat tolerant to baller

1396.24 --> 1400.72
so that I could have a a mixed

1400.919 --> 1407.76
chat and have conversations about other

1404.6 --> 1409.559
things with Ballers without like getting

1407.76 --> 1412.64
into fights and all

1409.559 --> 1414.44
that and so that was getting more and

1412.64 --> 1417.919
more

1414.44 --> 1419.559
conflicting and like I was just done I

1417.919 --> 1422.76
like I don't want

1419.559 --> 1422.76
the the

1422.88 --> 1426.0390000000002
fighting the

1428.279 --> 1434.159
grinding I have nice what are you

1431.84 --> 1434.1589999999999
talking

1436.12 --> 1440.4399999999998
about was that yesterday

1444.799 --> 1447.36
I had no

1450.48 --> 1454.3600000000001
idea I didn't notice

1458.32 --> 1461.32
anything

1465.679 --> 1470.3600000000001
h no that's literally today

1474.08 --> 1476.76
wait no it

1478.6 --> 1485.1999999999998
isn't oh yeah it is there no there's

1481.679 --> 1488.72
Queen's night 26th of April whatever

1485.2 --> 1488.72
that is and today

1489.24 --> 1495.2
is is that so there should be markets

1492.799 --> 1497.399
out there well I will go out for

1495.2 --> 1500.279
groceries later but I think that all the

1497.399 --> 1503.039
markets will be closed by then so no I

1500.279 --> 1503.039
didn't really go

1525.399 --> 1530.559
anywhere H all right well thank you for

1528.559 --> 1533.72
that Prince of Rhythm I mean I do my

1530.559 --> 1536.36
best to explain these kinds of

1533.72 --> 1537.24
things oh what Neil is getting the [Â __Â ]

1536.36 --> 1539.6
beat

1537.24 --> 1542.6
out

1539.6 --> 1542.6
okay

1548.919 --> 1555.64
really what the hell is he even doing

1551.72 --> 1558.64
there are you sure about that where is

1555.64 --> 1558.64
he

1564.039 --> 1568.96
I don't see

1566.12 --> 1575.1589999999999
oh oh yeah there he

1568.96 --> 1575.159
is ah there no point like he can't argue

1578.52 --> 1586.08
[Â __Â ] I mean he gets how it works is just

1582.399 --> 1586.08
not good at arguing

1600.84 --> 1605.799
right but yeah I really appreciate that

1603.44 --> 1608.8400000000001
that you're saying that princi of Rhythm

1605.799 --> 1610.72
I do really do my best to explain things

1608.84 --> 1614.279
in a digestible

1610.72 --> 1616.96
way and that is quite a challenge

1614.279 --> 1619.48
sometimes a lot of flat earthers that

1616.96 --> 1622.679
get caught up in it are so specialized

1619.48 --> 1625.24
that they just have trouble reaching

1622.679 --> 1627.5590000000002
down to people that don't really

1625.24 --> 1631.44
understand it

1627.559 --> 1634.44
yet unless they're universally

1631.44 --> 1637.3200000000002
specialized at doing that just that like

1634.44 --> 1639.24
for example Mark Sergeant but those

1637.32 --> 1641.2
people tend to

1639.24 --> 1643.6
also not

1641.2 --> 1647.3600000000001
develop their

1643.6 --> 1650.8799999999999
overall insights as much and kind of

1647.36 --> 1654.32
just stick to standard

1650.88 --> 1656.6000000000001
story and so I'm kind of in between that

1654.32 --> 1659.399
like I do keep track of like really

1656.6 --> 1661.519
Pinnacle insights and developments but

1659.399 --> 1665.399
at the same time also do my best to be

1661.519 --> 1670.279
able to explain the details of them to

1665.399 --> 1672.1999999999998
people that aren't so well versed at

1670.279 --> 1674.84
Flat Earth

1672.2 --> 1676.6000000000001
lore a lot of people that are by the way

1674.84 --> 1680.12
are completely filled up with

1676.6 --> 1680.12
misinformation too

1680.96 --> 1684.96
with just assumptions like dis

1686.12 --> 1690.5189999999998
assumptions ether

1688.679 --> 1696.3990000000001
assumptions all

1690.519 --> 1696.3990000000001
that which I specifically do my best to

1699.88 --> 1706.5590000000002
avoid yeah Gary f i I just checked out

1703.24 --> 1710.1200000000001
his chat and I saw him there I

1706.559 --> 1710.12
mean whatever

1737.039 --> 1743.559
yeah and debatable I mean I'm not a big

1740.44 --> 1743.559
fan of King's day

1747.44 --> 1755.3200000000002
anyway I mean our supposed Noble House

1751.76 --> 1758.0
really really sucks like they're really

1755.32 --> 1758.0
[Â __Â ]

1761.88 --> 1766.7990000000002
terrible and like I used to kind of like

1765.76 --> 1769.399
the

1766.799 --> 1772.84
idea of they're being a king and all

1769.399 --> 1776.08
that but I mean they are full on anti-

1772.84 --> 1781.4399999999998
Dutch anti-

1776.08 --> 1784.76
human totally WF agents and the sooner

1781.44 --> 1784.76
we get rid of them the

1788.2 --> 1795.039
better they're just

1792.08 --> 1798.039
terrible and they're traitors to the

1795.039 --> 1798.039
people

1804.399 --> 1810.0
so like yeah that development in the

1807.88 --> 1813.44
last few years has

1810.0 --> 1817.12
really dimmed My overall

1813.44 --> 1821.0800000000002
enthusiasm for these kinds of

1817.12 --> 1826.1589999999999
events like I don't want to honor this

1821.08 --> 1829.24
that family like at all they're

1826.159 --> 1832.44
terrible I mean a decade ago I still had

1829.24 --> 1834.919
some level of hopes for them that they

1832.44 --> 1837.44
might change it around but they didn't

1834.919 --> 1841.679
they just became much

1837.44 --> 1843.96
worse like they are like getting on the

1841.679 --> 1848.1200000000001
level of like being like Bill Gates and

1843.96 --> 1853.1200000000001
all that they're absolutely

1848.12 --> 1853.12
horrendous horrendous and Evil

1859.75 --> 1862.92
[Music]

1865.53 --> 1878.089
[Music]

1881.519 --> 1888.32
pretty much very similar to like the

1884.84 --> 1890.279
king of England who's also horrendous

1888.32 --> 1894.6
and

1890.279 --> 1894.6
terrible more overtly

1908.88 --> 1913.3590000000002
[Music]

1925.039 --> 1932.399
right but I mean like yeah virtual

1929.0 --> 1935.36
virtue and V of Rhythm it's really weird

1932.399 --> 1937.76
just I'm still I have a membership at

1935.36 --> 1941.4399999999998
Nathan's I don't know how I even got

1937.76 --> 1944.919
that it's very weird I like I literally

1941.44 --> 1949.76
didn't know where I got

1944.919 --> 1953.159
that but I do have it

1949.76 --> 1957.1589999999999
and I watch this Members Only video how

1953.159 --> 1962.0800000000002
big is Flat Earth and it's just

1957.159 --> 1962.0800000000002
Nathan just yelling at at these

1962.36 --> 1965.6
Ballers just

1966.44 --> 1969.88
yelling and I'm

1970.679 --> 1978.039
like why would you even want to upload

1974.36 --> 1978.039
that as a video

1979.08 --> 1983.799
and like three months ago I would have

1981.44 --> 1986.72
been like yeah of course oh there's

1983.799 --> 1991.039
another bunch of numpties now I just see

1986.72 --> 1991.039
it it's like that is just

1991.88 --> 1998.3600000000001
terrible I mean yeah he's he got them by

1995.6 --> 2002.12
the balls and he's technically correct

1998.36 --> 2005.08
but just the whole attitude that's

2002.12 --> 2008.7199999999998
terrible like that's a terrible way to

2005.08 --> 2008.72
advertise yourself

2013.88 --> 2017.8400000000001
and I'm very glad that I don't do

2021.639 --> 2030.9189999999999
that I mean yeah I'll I'll call Ballers

2027.0 --> 2035.2
balarts right but I'll do it in a

2030.919 --> 2035.2
relatively calm voice

2038.679 --> 2043.8400000000001
I'll just treat them as

2041.0 --> 2046.519
psychological shortcomings and ailments

2043.84 --> 2048.96
and like yeah talk a little down to them

2046.519 --> 2052.0
but I'll do it mostly

2048.96 --> 2053.679
calmly unless I get in a bad mood and

2052.0 --> 2057.879
then I'll get like

2053.679 --> 2057.879
more or grouchy about

2059.04 --> 2065.72
it but no more just straight out cursing

2063.8 --> 2068.7200000000003
like I'm not doing that anymore it's not

2065.72 --> 2072.4399999999996
good it's not healthy it's it's bad

2068.72 --> 2072.4399999999996
image I don't like

2075.879 --> 2082.5989999999997
that I don't want to be that

2078.52 --> 2085.599
guy like I am an amicable

2082.599 --> 2090.04
person I naturally like

2085.599 --> 2092.3590000000004
that and even though I do not have a lot

2090.04 --> 2094.48
of Tolerance naturally that's why

2092.359 --> 2097.7999999999997
there's hasht intolerance in the hashtag

2094.48 --> 2101.2400000000002
list it's there for a reason

2097.8 --> 2104.96
that doesn't mean that I should then

2101.24 --> 2108.3199999999997
like emphasize that part as much as I

2104.96 --> 2111.4
can I don't want to be that guy I don't

2108.32 --> 2114.48
want to be rage

2111.4 --> 2116.76
win it only just attracts a bunch of

2114.48 --> 2120.0
nasty ass trolls

2116.76 --> 2123.4
anyway right that don't give me the

2120.0 --> 2126.56
ability to do it to have an good excuse

2123.4 --> 2128.359
to do rage when they just pollute

2126.56 --> 2131.0789999999997
everything

2128.359 --> 2134.56
because they suck with their

2131.079 --> 2135.4
presence and how they say things it's

2134.56 --> 2138.119
just

2135.4 --> 2140.359
tedious and I don't even want to like

2138.119 --> 2142.76
have them dragging around me everywhere

2140.359 --> 2145.7599999999998
I go cuz then other people are going to

2142.76 --> 2147.4
associate me with those trolls because

2145.76 --> 2150.6800000000003
they just keep following me and I don't

2147.4 --> 2150.6800000000003
want that

2151.46 --> 2157.26
[Music]

2165.2 --> 2170.1189999999997
right so I

2167.04 --> 2173.88
guess I guess that was

2170.119 --> 2176.6800000000003
it oh hey clear good to see

2173.88 --> 2180.28
you just in time to break that 10

2176.68 --> 2180.2799999999997
minutes of silence

2186.5 --> 2190.09
[Music]

2194.839 --> 2198.0
here I'm above that

2203.96 --> 2209.119
nonsense I wouldn't even call it

2206.119 --> 2210.96
nonsense it's just bad form it's not

2209.119 --> 2213.92
nonsense I

2210.96 --> 2217.68
mean these anti flat earthers are

2213.92 --> 2219.48
tedious they're Liars

2217.68 --> 2223.24
they

2219.48 --> 2225.56
scheme complicated psychological schemes

2223.24 --> 2227.68
to deceive themselves and others into

2225.56 --> 2229.599
ball belief and distract them away from

2227.68 --> 2232.7599999999998
Flat Earth

2229.599 --> 2235.119
realizations and yeah that'll get people

2232.76 --> 2235.119
very

2235.92 --> 2242.96
agitated it's just no point in like

2239.64 --> 2242.96
pushing that all the

2245.319 --> 2250.119
time it's basically the anti say flat

2247.88 --> 2253.6400000000003
earthers they cannot be helped like

2250.119 --> 2256.6800000000003
they're going to be mental

2253.64 --> 2259.44
cases probably the rest of their

2256.68 --> 2263.04
lives and you just have to like leave

2259.44 --> 2266.7200000000003
them in their Bal [Â __Â ] looney

2263.04 --> 2269.2799999999997
bin and trust that other people even

2266.72 --> 2272.359
newcomers will be able to figure out

2269.28 --> 2279.0400000000004
like these people are freaking

2272.359 --> 2282.2799999999997
insane like they are palpably insane

2279.04 --> 2284.839
insane liars and

2282.28 --> 2286.88
deceivers you can't fix stupid that's

2284.839 --> 2288.2799999999997
right it's not just stupid though it is

2286.88 --> 2292.4
Devious it's

2288.28 --> 2296.3590000000004
not just dumb it's devious they're

2292.4 --> 2301.8
devious they're evil in a way they're

2296.359 --> 2305.0
evily evil deceptive to themselves as

2301.8 --> 2308.0
well but you can't fix that

2305.0 --> 2310.76
either you can point it out and then

2308.0 --> 2313.92
like okay now I don't want to have

2310.76 --> 2313.92
anything to do with you

2315.2 --> 2320.839
anymore

2317.079 --> 2320.8390000000004
disconnect do something

2321.04 --> 2327.8
else like that's the way that actually

2324.119 --> 2327.8
would that's the best course of

2332.8 --> 2339.2400000000002
action because they're always going to

2334.76 --> 2339.2400000000002
be out there and there's tons of them

2340.24 --> 2346.24
dirt

2342.48 --> 2348.2
Ballers demon globins yeah something

2346.24 --> 2351.839
like

2348.2 --> 2357.359
that it is pretty demonic

2351.839 --> 2357.359
though they are like luciferian

2361.24 --> 2365.64
Spellbound hello Frank

2367.19 --> 2370.679
[Music]

2374.5 --> 2380.68
[Music]

2377.839 --> 2385.92
I mean they're luciferian

2380.68 --> 2385.9199999999996
Spellbound no you can't what don't goof

2388.92 --> 2392.7200000000003
around it's not funny

2395.88 --> 2403.6400000000003
Clary the anti flat earthers they are

2399.64 --> 2403.64
like contracted by

2403.92 --> 2410.0
Lucifer like within the araman

2407.0 --> 2410.0
Lucifer

2413.44 --> 2420.92
Paradigm they are in contract with his

2417.4 --> 2424.28
cosmology with his ideas it is

2420.92 --> 2426.839
a originally a Jesuit

2424.28 --> 2429.4
thing I mean it is technically like

2426.839 --> 2433.44
their in invention their mathematical

2429.4 --> 2435.04
conception invention but it is like it's

2433.44 --> 2440.16
a

2435.04 --> 2444.16
lie a parallel constructed alternative

2440.16 --> 2448.04
reality and it is of Lucifer it is not

2444.16 --> 2449.04
like death Aran but it is like oh no we

2448.04 --> 2455.2799999999997
know

2449.04 --> 2455.2799999999997
better we got a better world without God

2458.52 --> 2461.359
the hell are you doing

2461.56 --> 2469.88
Cleary are you in an unstable

2464.56 --> 2469.88
mood please just tone it

2484.4 --> 2488.4
down right

2488.599 --> 2494.92
yeah was by the way I was talking with

2490.359 --> 2494.92
the flatter Sage yesterday over Skype a

2495.8 --> 2502.119
lot which was a great conversation

2499.52 --> 2505.079
and basically shared some of these

2502.119 --> 2507.1600000000003
struggles that I deal with emotionally

2505.079 --> 2510.8390000000004
and all

2507.16 --> 2514.2799999999997
that and talked a lot about rudol

2510.839 --> 2518.7599999999998
Steiner and how the technique

2514.28 --> 2521.5600000000004
really is in the roots of Ro rol Steiner

2518.76 --> 2523.76
and how

2521.56 --> 2526.04
magnificently like Rudolph Steiner

2523.76 --> 2528.44
effectively is one of the guys that

2526.04 --> 2531.52
revealed the akashik

2528.44 --> 2533.48
record I never even overtly realized

2531.52 --> 2535.88
that about him I always thought like oh

2533.48 --> 2537.76
the akashic record is just this this

2535.88 --> 2541.359
hippie dippy thing that's like been

2537.76 --> 2544.3190000000004
known for quite a while I never realized

2541.359 --> 2546.2
that he basically is like the inventor

2544.319 --> 2549.0
of that he is the one that figured that

2546.2 --> 2553.5989999999997
out

2549.0 --> 2558.04
do you know what mean yeah that means I

2553.599 --> 2558.04
am in French

2565.0 --> 2571.24
clar I don't know a lot of French but I

2567.64 --> 2571.24
know that one

2583.319 --> 2590.64
but like rud Steiner is like what a an

2587.24 --> 2594.1189999999997
amazing figure that was and like even if

2590.64 --> 2598.839
you just watch the Wikipedia which is a

2594.119 --> 2598.839
mainstream site right I mean even if you

2601.52 --> 2608.359
just I

2603.76 --> 2608.3590000000004
no stop it Clary

2623.96 --> 2629.2
I don't think that has anything to do

2625.72 --> 2629.2
with with the name

2632.8 --> 2637.88
Jesus

2634.44 --> 2640.2400000000002
well maybe

2637.88 --> 2641.599
ah it's just very very freaking

2640.24 --> 2645.9599999999996
distracting

2641.599 --> 2649.13
dude but yeah maybe maybe just weed does

2645.96 --> 2650.96
have some relation to Jesus I

2649.13 --> 2654.92
[Music]

2650.96 --> 2658.4
mean arguably Jesus was in France and

2654.92 --> 2658.4
all that so

2661.04 --> 2667.16
yeah but the thing is if you just read

2663.68 --> 2669.9199999999996
the main page from Wikipedia

2667.16 --> 2672.24
about Rudolph Steiner there's like tons

2669.92 --> 2676.599
of information in that

2672.24 --> 2678.3999999999996
Wikipedia that is like it will literally

2676.599 --> 2680.96
blow your

2678.4 --> 2684.28
mind that's just the mainstream

2680.96 --> 2687.28
Wikipedia page like it will blow your

2684.28 --> 2687.28
mind

2705.76 --> 2712.96
like the amount of things that I talk

2709.88 --> 2715.48
about that are his

2712.96 --> 2717.0
Concepts is really

2715.48 --> 2720.8
shocking

2717.0 --> 2723.04
like just look just look

2720.8 --> 2726.0
esotericism well guess what the symbol

2723.04 --> 2728.7599999999998
for esotericism is it's the thing that

2726.0 --> 2731.559
I've been hanging around my neck for a

2728.76 --> 2735.2000000000003
long damn time that I made I never even

2731.559 --> 2737.8390000000004
knew that yeah the Flower of Life is the

2735.2 --> 2737.839
symbol for

2739.28 --> 2743.96
that but uh what was the other thing

2741.76 --> 2743.96
that

2748.44 --> 2752.88
was

2750.04 --> 2756.88
yeah remember when I talked about that

2752.88 --> 2756.88
there's like two jesuses

2758.8 --> 2762.6800000000003
potentially that there was the

2763.8 --> 2768.319
nobleman

2765.48 --> 2771.4
and a and the

2768.319 --> 2775.68
Healer and that one died and basically

2771.4 --> 2775.6800000000003
gave the other one their

2775.96 --> 2781.88
power well guess where that idea came

2782.2 --> 2787.839
from yeah Rudolph Steiner he talked

2785.52 --> 2791.359
about that I didn't even know that I

2787.839 --> 2793.68
didn't even know that guys

2791.359 --> 2797.96
like it's

2793.68 --> 2800.5989999999997
just it's bizarre that I just find these

2797.96 --> 2802.48
ideas and I'm like oh wow this is really

2800.599 --> 2804.88
interesting like oh that makes sense to

2802.48 --> 2804.88
me and

2805.16 --> 2813.44
like and he came with that

2809.359 --> 2813.44
stuff a century

2814.359 --> 2819.48
ago it just blows my mind

2817.72 --> 2821.2799999999997
like looking through the page and then

2819.48 --> 2824.8
realizing like wait

2821.28 --> 2828.3590000000004
what he said that

2824.8 --> 2830.2000000000003
what like I didn't like oh everything

2828.359 --> 2832.0789999999997
I'm interested in I'm just going to look

2830.2 --> 2835.0
up Rudolph Steiner see what he has to

2832.079 --> 2836.8390000000004
say here and then make it the subject no

2835.0 --> 2840.52
I ran into this

2836.839 --> 2843.119
stuff completely separately by

2840.52 --> 2845.52
myself and just like yeah this makes

2843.119 --> 2848.1600000000003
sense oh this is really

2845.52 --> 2851.0
interesting and then it turns out that

2848.16 --> 2854.8799999999997
he's just been into that like a 100

2851.0 --> 2857.359
years ago and like what I mean no wonder

2854.88 --> 2859.96
every freaking time I read like a

2857.359 --> 2864.359
Rudolph Steiner book I just get this

2859.96 --> 2867.839
very strong sensation like I wrote

2864.359 --> 2871.24
that what the hell is going on like I

2867.839 --> 2874.2
I'm reading it and it's like like I

2871.24 --> 2876.0789999999997
wrote that book like that's the feeling

2874.2 --> 2880.0
I get it's really bizarre I've had that

2876.079 --> 2883.559
since the very very first time that like

2880.0 --> 2888.52
when I was a kid somebody read out a

2883.559 --> 2890.3590000000004
rudol siner text to me from a book and

2888.52 --> 2893.96
talked about esoterics and spirit

2890.359 --> 2896.839
mechanics and I'm like like wow I I had

2893.96 --> 2899.079
like I I remember this like not just

2896.839 --> 2901.72
like oh this I understand this no like I

2899.079 --> 2903.4
remember this yeah the first time ever

2901.72 --> 2908.5589999999997
hearing

2903.4 --> 2913.48
that so I feel just this crazy

2908.559 --> 2918.079
synchronicity with that man in many

2913.48 --> 2919.76
ways and like every time I just look

2918.079 --> 2922.4
through something Rudolph Steiner I

2919.76 --> 2926.44
realize like wait

2922.4 --> 2928.88
what like he thinks that I always

2926.44 --> 2930.4
thought that I didn't know he thought

2928.88 --> 2934.48
that too

2930.4 --> 2937.52
what what Steiner books did you read uh

2934.48 --> 2938.92
I'm currently reading science of the

2937.52 --> 2943.2
secrets of the

2938.92 --> 2948.04
Soul which is very tough

2943.2 --> 2950.48
one like it's just so hyper esoteric

2948.04 --> 2953.359
Spirit mechanics that like sometimes I

2950.48 --> 2956.28
like have actual trouble following it

2953.359 --> 2959.52
cuz he is diving really deep in

2956.28 --> 2961.6400000000003
it and but I mean I'm making some

2959.52 --> 2963.04
Headway I'm like at one third already

2961.64 --> 2967.44
which is very

2963.04 --> 2971.96
far for my doing I'm not a a good reader

2967.44 --> 2971.96
I don't read very far I get distracted a

2972.72 --> 2979.24
lot but it's been very Illuminating

2976.799 --> 2982.28
because he's just talking about a lot of

2979.24 --> 2982.2799999999997
it is like talking

2983.88 --> 2990.4
about like what happens to the spirit

2987.0 --> 2992.16
mechanics like when you die for example

2990.4 --> 2993.839
like what happens what will happen to

2992.16 --> 2997.359
your Consciousness what will happen to

2993.839 --> 2999.599
your Sensations like it's just

2997.359 --> 3002.24
hyper esoteric knowledge I don't even

2999.599 --> 3006.799
know like how we attained

3002.24 --> 3010.1189999999997
that it must have like looked beyond

3006.799 --> 3013.319
death and now that's going to be Mystic

3010.119 --> 3016.559
I mean nobody ever will really

3013.319 --> 3019.2799999999997
know but he is describing things

3016.559 --> 3019.28
logically in

3019.319 --> 3024.359
it using Spirit mechanics and is just

3023.4 --> 3028.44
pretty

3024.359 --> 3031.119
mindblowing if you can get into it

3028.44 --> 3033.16
but yeah the book I'm reading currently

3031.119 --> 3037.48
it's the only book I ever had by the way

3033.16 --> 3037.48
is the science of the secrets of the

3044.359 --> 3048.2
Soul Jesus had a

3051.119 --> 3058.6400000000003
twin

3053.24 --> 3058.64
uh maybe but that's not

3058.88 --> 3063.839
what the two jesuses are claimed to be

3061.319 --> 3068.24
though there were two different

3063.839 --> 3068.24
people like one is older than the

3070.559 --> 3077.52
other one was the descendant of

3074.119 --> 3079.44
Cleopatra nobleman

3077.52 --> 3081.559
orator

3079.44 --> 3085.04
Visionary other

3081.559 --> 3087.52
one younger one was a

3085.04 --> 3093.0
Healer and like

3087.52 --> 3093.0
I had like this surreal Purity to

3098.359 --> 3104.64
him I don't know I I don't even I I I

3102.28 --> 3105.559
actually I'm curious to know more about

3104.64 --> 3110.92
this

3105.559 --> 3113.2400000000002
because this is also like these that

3110.92 --> 3115.64
lore also

3113.24 --> 3117.5589999999997
references like his teens and all that

3115.64 --> 3120.1189999999997
it it references things that you don't

3117.559 --> 3120.119
read in the

3131.119 --> 3137.079
bible teach the righteous came right

3134.359 --> 3140.48
before Jesus

3137.079 --> 3140.48
what what is

3144.48 --> 3148.48
that okay

3154.4 --> 3164.14
B secrets of PHS what okay gas

3159.88 --> 3167.27
H that's something completely different

3164.14 --> 3167.27
[Music]

3184.44 --> 3190.03
that

3187.0 --> 3190.03
[Music]

3193.79 --> 3196.849
[Music]

3209.72 --> 3215.319
okay temporary title Dutch nobility

3212.839 --> 3217.88
sucks R Steiner is

3215.319 --> 3219.7599999999998
amazing right I'm going to turn on my

3217.88 --> 3221.7200000000003
coffee and put my Illuminati kasan in

3219.76 --> 3223.1600000000003
the oven I'm getting really hungry but I

3221.72 --> 3224.9599999999996
mean I feel like today is going to be an

3223.16 --> 3228.319
amicable

3224.96 --> 3230.76
show it is has been so far which is

3228.319 --> 3235.44
great hope you enjoyed it so far don't

3230.76 --> 3239.4
forget the Rogan it up and see you

3235.44 --> 3239.4
soon for

3325.2 --> 3330.96
Jesus didn't me go to France what do you

3327.48 --> 3336.079
mean he didn't really go to

3330.96 --> 3336.079
France uh yeah he

3336.28 --> 3344.8390000000004
did I actually think a lot of the Bible

3339.4 --> 3350.359
events didn't take place in

3344.839 --> 3350.359
Palestine they took place in France

3364.28 --> 3367.28
for

3415.24 --> 3418.24
yeah

3445.16 --> 3449.16
for e

3487.559 --> 3490.559
H

3491.76 --> 3496.44
interesting yeah I had never heard of

3493.88 --> 3500.52
that teacher of the righteous

3496.44 --> 3500.52
interesting thank you for sharing that

3505.119 --> 3509.079
CLE for

3512.16 --> 3515.37
[Music]

3547.119 --> 3554.28
what talking about Joseph was a tin man

3550.119 --> 3554.28
what the hell does that even mean

3576.799 --> 3584.88
St Ean Tibet yeah

3579.72 --> 3589.16
well allegedly after the

3584.88 --> 3593.119
supposed Roman issue crucifixion issue

3589.16 --> 3593.1189999999997
he went to India

3596.799 --> 3599.88
like I don't think he

3600.079 --> 3604.96
died but I mean like oh how dare you

3602.72 --> 3608.3999999999996
yeah that's right like I am basically

3604.96 --> 3609.76
saying no to scripture in that sense or

3608.4 --> 3611.52
not even to

3609.76 --> 3615.76
scripture

3611.52 --> 3618.599
to Christian religion like that like I

3615.76 --> 3621.7200000000003
am way more interested in Jesus the

3618.599 --> 3625.52
person than in any of the dogmatic

3621.72 --> 3628.0789999999997
nonsense about him being God or whatever

3625.52 --> 3632.16
like completely not interested in that

3628.079 --> 3635.119
at all I'm only interested in wisdom not

3632.16 --> 3635.1189999999997
dogmatic

3641.68 --> 3647.64
nonsense

3643.359 --> 3650.64
so I mean Muslims say that Jesus didn't

3647.64 --> 3652.2799999999997
really die and I'm like yeah yeah that

3650.64 --> 3657.92
sounds really

3652.28 --> 3657.92
reasonable I'm glad that they've been

3658.319 --> 3664.839
like proud and sturdy enough to be able

3661.64 --> 3669.2
to withstand the inquisitions that they

3664.839 --> 3672.0
had because of just being truthful about

3669.2 --> 3674.5589999999997
that that they with the Catholic

3672.0 --> 3678.359
Church's wrath for basically saying like

3674.559 --> 3678.3590000000004
no but he didn't die

3689.68 --> 3694.799
what what kind of statement is that gas

3695.88 --> 3701.6400000000003
H

3698.24 --> 3703.9199999999996
passport it's nonsense there is no

3701.64 --> 3707.0
passport in

3703.92 --> 3710.0
Antiquity it's not even like writing on

3707.0 --> 3710.0
paper

3719.64 --> 3724.7599999999998
found his Death

3721.079 --> 3724.76
Shroud yeah so they

3725.119 --> 3733.0
say but I mean whose Death Shroud is

3728.96 --> 3734.799
that right I mean Jesus could arguably

3733.0 --> 3737.359
be different

3734.799 --> 3739.24
people multiple

3737.359 --> 3743.88
people I

3739.24 --> 3743.8799999999997
mean they do that now all the

3744.0 --> 3750.72
time oh you were mess

3746.4 --> 3750.7200000000003
oh so you were just annoying

3754.72 --> 3761.0389999999998
then yeah how about don't do that don't

3757.96 --> 3765.16
mess yeah

3761.039 --> 3768.44
whenever and I mean ever in my chat have

3765.16 --> 3771.5589999999997
I appreciated when people are messing or

3768.44 --> 3774.64
just joking around I never appreciate

3771.559 --> 3778.119
that don't do that yeah we're talking

3774.64 --> 3781.72
about serious stuff no no

3778.119 --> 3781.7200000000003
messing don't do

3790.52 --> 3794.68
that

3792.24 --> 3799.5589999999997
right as I was going to

3794.68 --> 3804.48
say Jesus could have been different

3799.559 --> 3807.76
people just like in current times

3804.48 --> 3811.039
presidential figures have multiple

3807.76 --> 3813.5200000000004
people they have double gangers that

3811.039 --> 3816.44
also represent

3813.52 --> 3818.7599999999998
them so they can potentially be more

3816.44 --> 3823.88
easily in multiple

3818.76 --> 3823.88
places and have others take over for

3832.599 --> 3838.599
them and you're actually funny yeah I

3835.079 --> 3841.119
don't care L this is not the place for

3838.599 --> 3843.52
you to be funny we're talking about

3841.119 --> 3848.0
something very serious I don't want

3843.52 --> 3851.92
jokes right now yeah talking about Jesus

3848.0 --> 3854.599
it's not joking yeah this is not a joke

3851.92 --> 3859.48
this is very damn serious not your time

3854.599 --> 3859.48
to be a joking [Â __Â ]

3873.24 --> 3878.4399999999996
and if you can't handle that then later

3875.4 --> 3878.44
yeah then go

3881.88 --> 3887.319
away yeah when we talk about Jesus

3884.96 --> 3890.039
that's not the time to be an

3887.319 --> 3892.799
anti-christian piece of [Â __Â ] and just

3890.039 --> 3896.2000000000003
casually joke around like like you [Â __Â ]

3892.799 --> 3899.7599999999998
on him yeah don't do that never never do

3896.2 --> 3899.7599999999998
that in my presence

3900.52 --> 3907.7599999999998
ever yeah just because I deny church

3904.559 --> 3911.7200000000003
doctrine doesn't mean that I do not have

3907.76 --> 3918.0
high reverence for Jesus's Legacy and

3911.72 --> 3918.0
wisdom don't do that in my presence

3928.62 --> 3931.83
[Music]

3931.88 --> 3938.52
Judas had to kiss Jesus so they knew who

3934.16 --> 3942.64
he was that's an interesting right

3938.52 --> 3945.079
because he may have been multiple people

3942.64 --> 3945.0789999999997
at least

3945.44 --> 3953.279
two right it could be that one of the

3948.68 --> 3953.279
jesuses did get crucified

3957.0 --> 3960.279
it could very well

3960.559 --> 3972.4
be but then the other basically then got

3966.359 --> 3972.4
away or left left probably for

3980.48 --> 3984.64
India Jud is going to get someone else's

3983.279 --> 3986.48
Chap and they would have been on the

3984.64 --> 3989.319
wiser yeah but then Judas wouldn't have

3986.48 --> 3991.88
his 30 pieces of silver 20 or however

3989.319 --> 3991.88
much that

4001.2 --> 4005.0389999999998
was anyway good to see you

4012.64 --> 4016.839
LSG did you know that like in Rudolph

4015.599 --> 4021.7200000000003
Steiners

4016.839 --> 4021.72
Wikipedia they say he's a Christian

4021.96 --> 4024.96
Gnostic

4035.44 --> 4042.16
what like isn't that just like kind of

4039.279 --> 4046.559
mindblowing like the gnostics we know

4042.16 --> 4046.5589999999997
now are like self worshipping

4047.359 --> 4053.2
like spiritual atheists

4050.079 --> 4055.039
almost right because they are like

4053.2 --> 4056.839
almost atheist like they don't believe

4055.039 --> 4059.3190000000004
in God now we're actually the

4056.839 --> 4062.359
manifestation of God and that's like

4059.319 --> 4065.4
what we associate typically with

4062.359 --> 4068.24
narcism but then to say Christian nism

4065.4 --> 4069.64
like it almost makes it a paradox yet

4068.24 --> 4073.1189999999997
that

4069.64 --> 4076.279
is like what even Wikipedia says about

4073.119 --> 4078.359
him pretty astounding

4076.279 --> 4081.44
like it's pretty astounding to just see

4078.359 --> 4081.44
a mainstream

4082.079 --> 4086.96
Source even saying such a

4091.4 --> 4097.079
thing but in a way yeah I am all for it

4106.839 --> 4110.92
oh they even have like this whole part

4108.6 --> 4115.799
in rudol Steiner where it's like

4110.92 --> 4117.359
oh he was actually a fervant defender of

4115.799 --> 4119.839
the Jews at the

4117.359 --> 4123.08
time did you know

4119.839 --> 4125.5199999999995
that but then

4123.08 --> 4129.159
later he

4125.52 --> 4132.4400000000005
basically said he kind of changed his

4129.159 --> 4137.44
stance and he was like you know

4132.44 --> 4137.44
what a lot of them have just dilapidated

4140.08 --> 4147.719
and like they seem like a pointless

4145.6 --> 4151.08
culture so it's really kind of

4147.719 --> 4153.799
interesting how we had like very double

4151.08 --> 4153.799
stance on

4155.0 --> 4160.04
it

4156.88 --> 4163.04
anyway sorry for just verting back to R

4160.04 --> 4167.359
sign just that yesterday was very

4163.04 --> 4167.359
interesting reading for his Wikipedia

4168.149 --> 4171.259
[Music]

4174.12 --> 4178.3589999999995
yeah was in essence what does that

4185.6 --> 4189.679
mean right anyway I'm going to get my

4187.679 --> 4192.679
Illuminati sun and coffee I'll be right

4189.679 --> 4192.679
back

4224.32 --> 4227.32

4546.76 --> 4551.719
any

4548.239 --> 4553.4
way like for Jesus's death or whatever I

4551.719 --> 4555.639
don't remember like I don't know the

4553.4 --> 4557.0
Bible well enough to

4555.639 --> 4561.4400000000005
to know

4557.0 --> 4561.44
that to be fair

4571.1 --> 4574.1990000000005

4795.12 --> 4800.36
through the links and

4796.84 --> 4800.360000000001
[Â __Â ] but

Cheers for

4883.56 --> 4887.56

4916.28 --> 4924.88
ah no clearly it says here it is

4920.92 --> 4929.639
believed by some to be coming from

4924.88 --> 4929.639
Enoch is but it's uncertain

4949.32 --> 4953.48
other

4951.239 --> 4957.599999999999
people are

4953.48 --> 4957.599999999999
that the name comes from

4961.92 --> 4966.4400000000005
Ezra the elect of the people of

4971.6 --> 4978.84
Moses or to whom Moses brought forth the

4975.32 --> 4978.84
communions at Mount

4985.65 --> 4989.92

5061.239 --> 5064.48
good time

5066.6 --> 5070.400000000001
I'm being a bit quiet for my doing but I

5068.56 --> 5074.0
mean it's just because all the links are

5070.4 --> 5074.0
very interesting to

5081.09 --> 5084.229
[Music]

5092.84 --> 5098.679
read this B stuff is pretty boring

5104.84 --> 5108.84

you'd like to share then by all means

5287.159 --> 5293.719
just don't do like disrespectful jokes

5291.239 --> 5298.159
about Jesus or anything then that's fine

5293.719 --> 5298.159
you don't have to find it interesting

5300.0 --> 5304.67
necessarily I

5303.119 --> 5306.88
do

5304.67 --> 5310.28
[Music]

5306.88 --> 5312.92
h i mean if there's anything else

5310.28 --> 5314.96
that has your attention that you'd like

5312.92 --> 5316.52
me to

5314.96 --> 5319.199
[Music]

5316.52 --> 5321.400000000001
address that doesn't include me having

5319.199 --> 5325.0
to watch a video in order to say

5321.4 --> 5325.0
anything about it

5364.96 --> 5369.2390000000005
like for example anything physics

5370.84 --> 5376.1990000000005
related I can always just talk about

5373.199 --> 5376.199
that

5390.36 --> 5394.03
[Music]

5405.199 --> 5408.919999999999
otherwise I'm just going to go browse

5410.56 --> 5415.4400000000005
around and see if I can bump into

5413.28 --> 5418.759999999999
anything that is interesting and worth

5415.44 --> 5418.759999999999
talking about

5448.99 --> 5452.1089999999995
[Music]

5463.4 --> 5466.45
[Music]

5482.92 --> 5485.92
hm

5503.45 --> 5506.71
[Music]

5512.84 --> 5516.88
for for

5546.76 --> 5549.9890000000005
[Music]

5572.84 --> 5576.8
h for

5616.92 --> 5621.4400000000005
okay I can't find

5618.92 --> 5624.84
anything it's really noteworthy other

5621.44 --> 5628.759999999999
than uh some person here in the

5624.84 --> 5631.92
Netherlands refused to take like a a

5628.76 --> 5635.719
medal from them from the

5631.92 --> 5635.719
King because the king sucks

5639.56 --> 5642.639
and like when you die you have to hand

5641.56 --> 5645.1990000000005
it

5642.639 --> 5647.96
back not even joking it's not like even

5645.199 --> 5650.879999999999
your kids can inherit it like after you

5647.96 --> 5654.76
die you have to hand it back that's how

5650.88 --> 5654.76
they work it's it's

5657.0 --> 5662.639
ridiculous as far as I'm

5660.04 --> 5665.719
concerned the Dutch nobilities should be

5662.639 --> 5665.719
completely discontin

5665.88 --> 5669.76
continued and criminally

5671.08 --> 5676.04
persecuted for the crimes against

5673.6 --> 5678.639
humanity and treachery that they have

5676.04 --> 5678.639
engaged

5683.159 --> 5689.48
with okay carrot got

5686.119 --> 5692.88
banned FL is obsessed with the Bible

5689.48 --> 5696.04
yeah but he's obsessed with dogmatic

5692.88 --> 5700.88
Bible dog matism Garrett SC

5696.04 --> 5700.88
man and that is really [Â __Â ]

5701.56 --> 5706.88
annoying I'm just interested in

5704.08 --> 5711.04
information and

5706.88 --> 5713.56
wisdom and so I look more broadly and

5711.04 --> 5717.719
I'm definitely willing

5713.56 --> 5721.04
to break almost every

5717.719 --> 5721.04
Dogma that is

5722.36 --> 5727.719
claimed yeah

5725.159 --> 5731.4
I totally get it if you're annoyed with

5727.719 --> 5734.119
flat soid for being a dogmatic dimwit

5731.4 --> 5739.239
which is literally that I call

5734.119 --> 5742.92
that with purpose cuz it is dimwitted to

5739.239 --> 5747.08
be like holding on to dogmatism like

5742.92 --> 5750.8
that it is dumb it is provably

5747.08 --> 5754.639
dumb cuz you can't justify

5750.8 --> 5756.679
it nobody can there's some people that

5754.639 --> 5758.2390000000005
attempt to do such things and all they

5756.679 --> 5761.6
end up doing is

5758.239 --> 5763.44
referencing other priests that basically

5761.6 --> 5767.159000000001
just say

5763.44 --> 5771.04
it like that's that's some kind of

5767.159 --> 5771.04
authority instead of using

5774.32 --> 5781.119
logic and that's really annoying like I

5777.48 --> 5783.04
wouldn't want to sit in a show and

5781.119 --> 5784.839999999999
listen to that either if I could even

5783.04 --> 5789.04
make out what the [Â __Â ] he's saying

5784.84 --> 5789.04
because he's so damn inaudible at

5789.719 --> 5794.639
times two buddies are even dumber yeah

5792.8 --> 5797.6
well there's always there's always

5794.639 --> 5802.400000000001
somebody Dumber so

5797.6 --> 5802.400000000001
whatever they want to be dogmatic dumb

5802.44 --> 5808.719
asses fine I mean they're completely

5805.48 --> 5812.638999999999
surrounded by trolls so I wouldn't

5808.719 --> 5812.639
expect anything else

5824.32 --> 5831.08
right I'm just interested in

5827.719 --> 5835.639
wisdom and especially in

5831.08 --> 5835.639
uprooting figuring out un

5837.36 --> 5844.5599999999995
uncovering knowledge and truth and

5841.36 --> 5847.28
history that has been

5844.56 --> 5851.400000000001
suppressed and arguably

5847.28 --> 5856.92
removed by dogmatic religion and

5851.4 --> 5860.5599999999995
agency it's like if the Jesuits erased

5856.92 --> 5864.159
it engineered information to be out of

5860.56 --> 5867.96
the loop then I want to know about it

5864.159 --> 5871.44
and like put it forth

5867.96 --> 5874.08
maximum because I'm pretty much an

5871.44 --> 5874.08
anti-jesuit

5875.52 --> 5882.4800000000005
very seriously like I like categorically

5879.36 --> 5884.719
oppose everything that they've ever done

5882.48 --> 5887.4
because everything they've ever done has

5884.719 --> 5891.2390000000005
been extremely

5887.4 --> 5893.759999999999
evil in a subtle way that people don't

5891.239 --> 5897.159
see because they've grown up in a world

5893.76 --> 5897.159000000001
that has been engineered by

5897.4 --> 5901.839999999999
them they are the Arbiters of

5899.88 --> 5904.96
information and what people get to learn

5901.84 --> 5907.360000000001
and what they end up believing

5904.96 --> 5911.08
and they have been for

5907.36 --> 5914.36
centuries not a century

5911.08 --> 5917.36
centuries across so many generations

5914.36 --> 5919.679
that when you have enough Generations

5917.36 --> 5924.28
that have gone through the same type of

5919.679 --> 5926.4800000000005
filter you lose track you lose the grip

5924.28 --> 5928.119
over reality like it's becomes much

5926.48 --> 5930.879999999999
harder to actually figure out what is

5928.119 --> 5933.639
real and what isn't more of a struggle

5930.88 --> 5937.1990000000005
and the entire world especially the

5933.639 --> 5939.719
Western world is suffering enormously

5937.199 --> 5939.719
because of

5939.84 --> 5943.4400000000005
that because of their

5944.639 --> 5950.32
influence and so all information needs

5948.76 --> 5954.92
to come

5950.32 --> 5957.96
about go floating up be figured out and

5954.92 --> 5962.4400000000005
the lies need to be

5957.96 --> 5966.28
erased the political religious lies need

5962.44 --> 5968.16
to be revealed for what they

5966.28 --> 5975.44
are and

5968.16 --> 5978.48
[Music]

5975.44 --> 5982.799999999999
discarded like wisdom and logic need to

5978.48 --> 5986.48
reain again yeah and that's not

5982.8 --> 5988.96
science logic which denies a whole bunch

5986.48 --> 5992.638999999999
of stuff and literally just

5988.96 --> 5995.08
lies like palpably lies about things in

5992.639 --> 5999.8
favor of some kind of

5995.08 --> 6003.04
idea but actual Logic the logic of God

5999.8 --> 6006.08
the logic that was given by God logic

6003.04 --> 6007.0
that exists because God designed things

6006.08 --> 6011.199
that

6007.0 --> 6014.92
way designed the akashic record for

6011.199 --> 6018.119
things to be revealed the way that they

6014.92 --> 6022.0
are consistently so that people that go

6018.119 --> 6024.199
on a discovery of insight come to the

6022.0 --> 6027.76
same conclusions because because that is

6024.199 --> 6027.759999999999
how it is

6029.32 --> 6033.0
logic and that's what I

6033.199 --> 6039.5199999999995
want and that is in direct opposition to

6037.32 --> 6043.119
what Jesuits

6039.52 --> 6043.119000000001
do where it's all

6043.679 --> 6048.52
about engineering

6046.28 --> 6053.36
knowledge

6048.52 --> 6055.8
to withhold wisdom and insight

6053.36 --> 6055.799999999999
from the

6062.13 --> 6072.119
[Music]

6069.08 --> 6076.639
public right and

6072.119 --> 6078.96
any Bible thumping dogmatist

6076.639 --> 6083.08
idiot they are

6078.96 --> 6085.639
like the go gim of the Jesuits that's

6083.08 --> 6085.639
what they

6086.32 --> 6094.08
are if you repeat that Dogma hor [Â __Â ]

6090.52 --> 6097.4400000000005
that is like in your face

6094.08 --> 6100.84
illogical then you are like their slaves

6097.44 --> 6104.36
not of the Jews but of the Jesuits you

6100.84 --> 6104.360000000001
are their slaves

6111.56 --> 6114.849
[Music]

6117.15 --> 6120.349999999999
[Music]

6123.679 --> 6126.76
and I will not be their

6133.88 --> 6140.04
slaves right and hey that's going to be

6137.44 --> 6142.119
very easy for them including people like

6140.04 --> 6145.199
for example Jim Bob who I don't have

6142.119 --> 6148.04
anything person any personal beef with

6145.199 --> 6150.598999999999
other than that I like Owen

6148.04 --> 6154.119
Benjamin more than I like

6150.599 --> 6159.400000000001
him but I mean he's going to categorize

6154.119 --> 6161.598999999999
me as a Pharisee or a gnostic or I mean

6159.4 --> 6164.239
there's plenty of things I talk about

6161.599 --> 6166.92
that make it very easy for me to

6164.239 --> 6170.159
categorize me from a religious dogmatist

6166.92 --> 6173.2390000000005
point of you as one of those people yeah

6170.159 --> 6178.44
so I am definitely one of those people

6173.239 --> 6181.239
people yeah I am I am one of those

6178.44 --> 6186.32
people one of those people that you

6181.239 --> 6188.919999999999
categorize as not not comporting with

6186.32 --> 6191.92
your dogmatic convictions that is

6188.92 --> 6194.88
correct if you have any form of dogmatic

6191.92 --> 6197.159
convictions I will per default even if I

6194.88 --> 6201.159000000001
don't know anything about what you

6197.159 --> 6204.199
believe I will per default put myself in

6201.159 --> 6207.5599999999995
an opposition

6204.199 --> 6211.638999999999
I will pretty much choose anything that

6207.56 --> 6214.679
opposes those viewpoints why because

6211.639 --> 6218.28
it's dogmatic and I hate

6214.679 --> 6222.36
Dogma I think it is

6218.28 --> 6225.8
luciferian it is a a seduction from the

6222.36 --> 6229.32
devil straight on

6225.8 --> 6231.56
psychologically and it is conjured by

6229.32 --> 6237.719
people that hunger for

6231.56 --> 6237.719
power mind control Power Dogma is mind

6238.92 --> 6247.76
control makes you lay down logic and

6243.52 --> 6250.679
reason which includes God and God

6247.76 --> 6252.8
awareness yeah it makes you lay it down

6250.679 --> 6258.08
in favor of

6252.8 --> 6260.1990000000005
some Earthly Goods or peer

6258.08 --> 6263.88
pressure that kind of

6260.199 --> 6266.839999999999
thing and I adamantly oppose that with

6263.88 --> 6266.84
every fiber of my

6270.44 --> 6277.879999999999
being right to the point where I I'd

6274.4 --> 6281.638999999999
actually gladly die for those

6277.88 --> 6284.639
convictions if it came to

6281.639 --> 6287.679
that not that I would like to die but I

6284.639 --> 6290.56
mean if I had if I would be

6287.679 --> 6293.88
forc decide with some

6290.56 --> 6297.719
Dogma or die

6293.88 --> 6302.08
then I pretty much choose to kill those

6297.719 --> 6302.08
that would try to force that on

6302.159 --> 6308.28
me yeah because I'm not just going to oh

6305.04 --> 6312.36
oh I'll just die then no no I'll kill

6308.28 --> 6312.36
you yeah that's how I

6315.92 --> 6322.4
work not just going to lay down my life

6318.679 --> 6325.28
in resistance no I'll kill you then if

6322.4 --> 6325.28
you force that

6325.91 --> 6328.949
[Music]

6331.679 --> 6336.56
[Â __Â ] and I think that's a much more

6334.4 --> 6341.199
reasonable position to

6336.56 --> 6344.599
take yeah I'm very non-aggression

6341.199 --> 6348.759999999999
very antiviolence pacifist

6344.599 --> 6354.1990000000005
overall even non- interventionist but

6348.76 --> 6359.0
if you try to force mind control on

6354.199 --> 6361.638999999999
me then I will oppose that to the

6359.0 --> 6361.639
maximum

6361.96 --> 6367.32
reach and of course most of the times

6364.96 --> 6370.56
violence will not be necessary but if it

6367.32 --> 6373.04
would come to that then I like violently

6370.56 --> 6373.04
oppose

6374.04 --> 6379.56
you just like for example medical

6376.639 --> 6382.400000000001
experiments if I for some reason and it

6379.56 --> 6385.599
hasn't happened it probably won't happen

6382.4 --> 6388.48
very likely to happen they can't do

6385.599 --> 6390.400000000001
it but if that suddenly got forced to

6388.48 --> 6393.879999999999
the point where people would show up on

6390.4 --> 6398.08
my door step and literally try to grab

6393.88 --> 6401.400000000001
me to inject something into

6398.08 --> 6405.08
me then I will make significant effort

6401.4 --> 6407.28
to slay those people and ensure that

6405.08 --> 6410.679
they are

6407.28 --> 6414.759999999999
dead not just disable them I would

6410.679 --> 6417.28
ensure that they would be dead

6414.76 --> 6419.159000000001
and I've declared that many times

6417.28 --> 6420.759999999999
especially a few years ago when this was

6419.159 --> 6423.5199999999995
like pretty

6420.76 --> 6426.599
upfront in the

6423.52 --> 6430.1990000000005
attention and that's how I

6426.599 --> 6431.84
work like I never commit violence ever

6430.199 --> 6435.04
like I've never done that I've never

6431.84 --> 6435.04
even done anything

6436.48 --> 6442.119
illegal but if something were to be

6438.8 --> 6444.84
forced on me then I will have a vicious

6442.119 --> 6444.839999999999
response

6446.91 --> 6450.0
[Music]

6452.0 --> 6455.0
m

6489.719 --> 6495.0
right

6492.04 --> 6496.96
but despite having that in my nature I

6495.0 --> 6500.679
don't think it's ever going to actually

6496.96 --> 6504.76
come to that but probably only because

6500.679 --> 6504.76
it's true because I would do that

6507.28 --> 6512.08
and people can feel and know that

6509.4 --> 6514.32
intuitively about me that yeah I would

6512.08 --> 6517.4
actually do

6514.32 --> 6518.599
that and therefore nothing will happen

6517.4 --> 6526.879999999999
to

6518.599 --> 6526.88
me because I do not have a victim exit

6531.28 --> 6536.88

6881.32 --> 6884.44
no show

then right could have gone on for like

6891.119 --> 6897.239
another hour

6893.88 --> 6899.32
easily thought I had good spirit it was

6897.239 --> 6902.959999999999
amicable today but I guess that

6899.32 --> 6908.639
everybody's just so incredibly bored

6902.96 --> 6911.599
that they just don't say anything for 20

6908.639 --> 6913.84
minutes so I guess that just nobody

6911.599 --> 6916.84
gives a [Â __Â ] about my

6913.84 --> 6916.84
show

6921.32 --> 6924.32

6937.57 --> 6946.5199999999995
[Music]

6951.239 --> 6955.28
e for

6984.679 --> 6989.159
maybe I'll just watch Joe Rogan's

6986.8 --> 6991.320000000001
experience

6989.159 --> 6994.598999999999
thing and

6991.32 --> 6996.92
uh see what I'll do with the rest of my

6994.599 --> 6999.88
day I think I'm probably not going to

6996.92 --> 7002.159
have a show tomorrow maybe not a show

6999.88 --> 7005.079
Monday

7002.159 --> 7008.119
either maybe I'm just going to like just

7005.079 --> 7010.719
do completely different things because

7008.119 --> 7015.44
this this is not

7010.719 --> 7015.44
tolerable this is not not acceptable

7069.04 --> 7077.29
[Music]

7079.51 --> 7085.89
[Music]

7102.079 --> 7105.079
e

7133.36 --> 7136.44
really yeah

7143.8 --> 7151.28
really yeah 25 minutes yeah yeah that's

7148.239 --> 7154.5599999999995
not tolerable did Gary do music that's

7151.28 --> 7154.5599999999995
not tolerable at

7157.48 --> 7164.718999999999
all it's the most absurd low level of

7161.44 --> 7167.28
chat activ I've ever seen on

7164.719 --> 7169.32
YouTube okay there's channels that have

7167.28 --> 7171.96
like 20

7169.32 --> 7175.799999999999
subscribers that get more chat activity

7171.96 --> 7179.159
than that it is absolutely

7175.8 --> 7179.159000000001
abominable and

7185.639 --> 7191.04
intolerable

7187.44 --> 7194.04
so if you don't want me to quit the show

7191.04 --> 7194.04
forever

7194.44 --> 7201.04
maybe put some people off

7197.76 --> 7201.04
yesterday like

7259.76 --> 7263.8
people cuz they were being

7268.44 --> 7275.96
annoying and Rowdy and I was in a bad

7272.88 --> 7279.0
mood yeah I did not ban tons of people I

7275.96 --> 7281.0
only banned trolls plenty of them cuz

7279.0 --> 7283.199
there were a lot of them trying to force

7281.0 --> 7285.639
themselves into my

7283.199 --> 7289.32
chat

7285.639 --> 7291.52
yeah so you can hear all these rumors

7289.32 --> 7295.199
about oh I'm just Banning everyone it's

7291.52 --> 7295.1990000000005
nonsense I don't ban

7295.4 --> 7298.96
everybody if I think they're actually

7297.88 --> 7302.400000000001
just

7298.96 --> 7305.639
people and not just troll sock accounts

7302.4 --> 7305.638999999999
I tend to time them

7306.76 --> 7314.159000000001
out yeah unless you're like an obvious

7310.599 --> 7317.719
troll cuz you have some stupid

7314.159 --> 7320.079
name or you have no damn point you're

7317.719 --> 7322.199
just a gimmick yeah then I'll I'll just

7320.079 --> 7325.04
ban you

7322.199 --> 7328.44
immediately and you won't hear about

7325.04 --> 7330.76
it time out people still put them up

7328.44 --> 7333.919999999999
yeah well that's too [Â __Â ]

7330.76 --> 7336.92
bad it is the way it is yeah don't be

7333.92 --> 7336.92
disruptive

7343.92 --> 7348.639
yeah I haven't timed anybody out with a

7351.76 --> 7356.76
wrench there's no excuse for that I

7354.28 --> 7359.679
don't know why people with wrenches

7356.76 --> 7362.679
aren't showing up today I mean fiber

7359.679 --> 7365.92
oats was there before my show even

7362.679 --> 7368.639
started and he didn't even say one thing

7365.92 --> 7371.52
after that CLA has been the only wrench

7368.639 --> 7374.639
that's actually hung around and issg

7371.52 --> 7374.639
said hello one

7378.33 --> 7381.5289999999995
[Music]

7390.32 --> 7395.44
time right and hey you can insert

7394.28 --> 7398.719
something

7395.44 --> 7401.199
new that is not a

7398.719 --> 7403.04
problem right if ISS G for example

7401.199 --> 7406.759999999999
wanted to talk about how he been

7403.04 --> 7409.639
woodworking or whatever that's

7406.76 --> 7412.56
cool that's absolutely

7409.639 --> 7414.719
fine fiber outs wants to say like hey

7412.56 --> 7417.4800000000005
yeah I finished the painting then I'm

7414.719 --> 7417.4800000000005
all good with

7417.88 --> 7422.1990000000005
that but there's just

7425.32 --> 7433.4
nothing which is a huge bummer because I

7429.0 --> 7437.079
feel pretty good today I've got good St

7433.4 --> 7439.0
energy and I talked about some

7437.079 --> 7443.5199999999995
interesting things I

7439.0 --> 7443.52
thought talking about rud Steiner in

7444.199 --> 7450.759999999999
detail relative

7446.679 --> 7450.76
detail but uh yeah I

7451.88 --> 7457.159000000001
mean guess today is just one of those

7454.239 --> 7462.4
days where nobody gives a

7457.159 --> 7462.4
[Â __Â ] except me I guess

7470.119 --> 7477.36
but I mean th this this type of

7473.48 --> 7480.598999999999
lack of people saying anything in chat I

7477.36 --> 7483.759999999999
mean like if that happens more often I

7480.599 --> 7486.4400000000005
will discontinue the early bird

7483.76 --> 7489.119000000001
show I will just not do it anymore I

7486.44 --> 7490.638999999999
will just start spending my time in

7489.119 --> 7493.36
another

7490.639 --> 7496.0
way and then you'll all have to do

7493.36 --> 7499.92
completely without including the days

7496.0 --> 7504.719
where you really wanted to yeah I'll not

7499.92 --> 7504.719
be a doing a show then either

7517.63 --> 7521.02
[Music]

7531.679 --> 7535.639
you'll be back tomorrow if I'm on

7538.04 --> 7544.44
yeah will I do another night out instead

7541.44 --> 7544.44
no

7553.639 --> 7560.92
no I'll just not do anything I'll just

7556.639 --> 7560.92
not continue my activity on

7563.159 --> 7570.44
YouTube right until maybe somebody just

7566.679 --> 7573.079
pays me to right CU that's where that

7570.44 --> 7575.4
will lead to like if if people are just

7573.079 --> 7576.96
like going to take what I do for granted

7575.4 --> 7579.879999999999
not show up at

7576.96 --> 7582.88
all then I'll stop doing it and if you

7579.88 --> 7585.400000000001
then want me back you'll have to pay

7582.88 --> 7588.84
me to do

7585.4 --> 7592.92
it cuz I'm not just going to show up

7588.84 --> 7595.52
every damn day to have people just

7592.92 --> 7598.52
completely leave me in the dust like

7595.52 --> 7598.52
this

7623.679 --> 7630.2390000000005
I had really hoped to to actually

7626.96 --> 7632.4
utilize my energy today cuz I do have

7630.239 --> 7635.28
good energy I'm

7632.4 --> 7638.598999999999
stable I got

7635.28 --> 7642.4
just I feel pretty

7638.599 --> 7646.2390000000005
good and then nobody shows up

7642.4 --> 7646.239
what am I supposed to do with

7670.44 --> 7674.48
this for

7711.559 --> 7714.52
hello debatable

7716.079 --> 7721.119
D what do you want to talk about

7722.17 --> 7725.81
[Music]

7734.96 --> 7737.32
Oh

7738.8 --> 7746.639
goodie drinking during the daytime are

7742.28 --> 7746.639
you oh goody

7765.639 --> 7768.8
is that it is everybody just depressed

7768.079 --> 7771.239
or

7768.8 --> 7774.1990000000005
something like I want to know what the

7771.239 --> 7774.199
[Â __Â ] is going on

7775.119 --> 7780.679
here I got good energy I'm

7781.639 --> 7787.76
stable I rolled in some decent subjects

7785.679 --> 7793.159
to ponder

7787.76 --> 7795.52
upon and everybody's just like not here

7793.159 --> 7795.5199999999995
or

7795.84 --> 7800.96
depleted or like we have a conversation

7798.92 --> 7803.719
and then just after like two minutes

7800.96 --> 7807.28
they just don't speak up anymore like

7803.719 --> 7810.96
what the [Â __Â ] is going on

7807.28 --> 7810.96
today why is this

7811.4 --> 7817.159
happening I'm I'm getting kind of sick

7814.0 --> 7820.0
of being annoyed and complaining about

7817.159 --> 7823.32
it I'm getting annoyed with myself

7820.0 --> 7823.32
complaining about this

7823.8 --> 7828.28
Saturday most people are doing other

7825.52 --> 7832.320000000001
stuff that but that's nonsense

7828.28 --> 7836.599
Frank Saturdays are usually the busiest

7832.32 --> 7836.599
shows for me

7852.88 --> 7857.4400000000005
clean house L

7868.679 --> 7874.159
okay happy good King's day all right I

7871.4 --> 7874.159
forget that you're

7874.76 --> 7878.96
Dutch of course you're drunk

7879.599 --> 7883.599
then a lot of people here like drink

7882.639 --> 7885.159000000001
during

7883.599 --> 7888.159000000001
that

7885.159 --> 7888.159
just

7889.239 --> 7894.04
ridiculous a ridiculous habit if you ask

7903.239 --> 7908.799999999999
me but I guess that if you're a drinker

7906.44 --> 7912.638999999999
then yeah you'll look out like oh whoa

7908.8 --> 7914.079000000001
King's day yeah now can just have a beer

7912.639 --> 7916.559
in the middle of the day and nobody's

7914.079 --> 7920.558999999999
going to look at you

7916.559 --> 7923.2390000000005
weird so I guess that makes sense it's

7920.559 --> 7926.320000000001
just like I don't drink

7923.239 --> 7929.04
anymore and like I'm shocked to find

7926.32 --> 7931.759999999999
that all this I find annoying enough to

7929.04 --> 7934.239
even actually consider in my head and

7931.76 --> 7938.599
I'm not going to do it consider actually

7934.239 --> 7942.119
getting a beer just to get away from

7938.599 --> 7943.84
this but then I just give iron whatever

7942.119 --> 7945.839999999999
he wanted and I don't want to do that

7943.84 --> 7949.2390000000005
there's no point in me like I don't

7945.84 --> 7949.2390000000005
drink anymore like at

7949.28 --> 7955.079
all

7952.079 --> 7955.079
what

7955.36 --> 7958.36
there

7959.88 --> 7963.88
what okay

7986.96 --> 7994.719
do I have any plans for today no

7992.0 --> 7997.639
Frank what the hell kind of plans would

7994.719 --> 8004.079
I ever have

7997.639 --> 8004.079
anyway plans to do what e

8032.76 --> 8039.280000000001
nice nature

8035.679 --> 8041.599
walk if yeah I mean I could potentially

8039.28 --> 8041.599
but I

8041.719 --> 8047.599
mean the weather's not like exactly

8044.92 --> 8049.28
fantastic or anything could go day

8047.599 --> 8052.679
drinking yeah

8049.28 --> 8052.679
goodie I don't

8054.639 --> 8062.28
drink like I i' just be very bored if I

8059.0 --> 8062.28
do that

8065.48 --> 8069.799999999999
now I'm probably going to watch The Joe

8067.199 --> 8073.199
Rogan Experience and then like find

8069.8 --> 8076.400000000001
another movie on Netflix or something

8073.199 --> 8078.239
and maybe tune in some streams I mean

8076.4 --> 8080.119
it's Saturday so there should be some

8078.239 --> 8082.36
Saturday streams

8080.119 --> 8085.88
typically that's what I'll be doing and

8082.36 --> 8085.88
then really hoping that

8085.96 --> 8091.639
tomorrow people will actually just show

8089.079 --> 8093.5199999999995
up again in my chat

8091.639 --> 8095.8
although I do appreciate the people that

8093.52 --> 8098.040000000001
are

8095.8 --> 8102.360000000001
now showing

8098.04 --> 8104.8
up after those horrendous 20 minutes of

8102.36 --> 8109.639
silence I do appreciate that you are

8104.8 --> 8109.639
showing yourself in my chat right now

8124.679 --> 8129.28
I guess I'm also just a bit disappointed

8127.0 --> 8131.599
that like where is the where are the

8129.28 --> 8136.119
wrenches where are

8131.599 --> 8136.119000000001

8162.04 --> 8168.599
looking tired according to you I don't

8164.119 --> 8168.598999999999
look tired at all and I don't feel

8169.36 --> 8174.32
tired what makes you think that

8200.84 --> 8205.960000000001
they didn't yeah they they're not

8202.519 --> 8205.960000000001
showing up

8217.08 --> 8221.399
I got plenty of wrenches tons of

8225.88 --> 8231.16
them I wish blue pill Devolution

8228.92 --> 8234.2
actually would show up

8231.16 --> 8235.92
once he only seems to show up when I'm

8234.2 --> 8238.599
like at my

8235.92 --> 8241.04
worst yesterday when I was like really

8238.599 --> 8244.359
at my worst like that's the only time he

8241.04 --> 8247.240000000002
just spoke up in my chat all of a

8244.359 --> 8249.639000000001
sudden after pretty much a week of like

8247.24 --> 8250.719
never saying anything I don't understand

8249.639 --> 8254.438999999998
blue

8250.719 --> 8254.438999999998
pill what what are you

8257.84 --> 8266.880000000001
doing when are you going to actually

8260.84 --> 8266.880000000001
join up with me and have have a a chat

8274.04 --> 8277.12
what does that mean for

8278.679 --> 8285.639
me well it means to me that they're just

8282.719 --> 8288.678999999998
like losing interest or something I

8285.639 --> 8288.679
don't know what the hell that

8298.24 --> 8303.519
is what's D fed we're live at this what

8301.679 --> 8306.679
are you talking

8303.519 --> 8310.519
about has nothing to do with anything

8306.679 --> 8314.16
fed isn't live it's weekend fed is never

8310.519 --> 8314.16
live in the weekend

8338.96 --> 8342.479
Dell was live for a

8346.76 --> 8355.08
bit but I mean his stream has ended like

8350.96 --> 8355.08
half an hour ago I think

8370.719 --> 8375.279999999999
maybe they're at Dell's then no he's his

8374.04 --> 8377.439
stream is

8375.28 --> 8381.679
ended

8377.439 --> 8381.679
rank ended a while

8382.28 --> 8389.720000000001
ago and nobody there is anybody that I

8386.96 --> 8394.0
know the guys that have wrenches here

8389.72 --> 8394.0
they don't hang around round Dell

8421.319 --> 8427.319
struggling for Content just shouting at

8424.08 --> 8427.319
videos I

8448.2 --> 8455.640000000001
guess might be good to do an B it

8453.479 --> 8458.199999999999
what I don't know what you're talking

8455.64 --> 8461.479
about debatable d i I don't see how the

8458.2 --> 8461.479000000001
wrenches want to see

8463.08 --> 8469.8
drama I don't see it and hey if they

8466.439 --> 8472.16
want drama I can give you [Â __Â ]

8469.8 --> 8476.16
drama but I'm not going to give you

8472.16 --> 8478.96
anything if you don't show

8476.16 --> 8481.24
up if you don't show up I'm just going

8478.96 --> 8483.599999999999
to be really frustrated

8481.24 --> 8486.199999999999
and tell you that if you continue doing

8483.6 --> 8489.84
that I will discontin the show that's

8486.2 --> 8489.84
what happens when you don't show

8508.479 --> 8514.479
up right and when you show up you don't

8511.64 --> 8516.96
always have to be able to contribute to

8514.479 --> 8519.76
the subject at hand you don't always

8516.96 --> 8522.039999999999
have to talk about the things that I

8519.76 --> 8522.04
talk

8522.52 --> 8530.52
about right but as long as I'm like in

8526.72 --> 8533.16
the flow about a subject then don't like

8530.52 --> 8535.84
duperon typically does he's not even

8533.16 --> 8539.359
here by the way I'm surprised that he

8535.84 --> 8541.6
usually does show up like every

8539.359 --> 8543.880000000001
day but but then when I'm in the flow

8541.6 --> 8545.92
and in the conversation then breaking

8543.88 --> 8549.08
and like suddenly introducing another

8545.92 --> 8551.68
subject yeah that's very dis that's very

8549.08 --> 8555.039999999999
annoying CU that breaks the

8551.68 --> 8557.16
flow but if it's like going slow and you

8555.04 --> 8562.080000000002
just got something random to say that

just

9027.6 --> 9034.16
my I'm going to

9030.12 --> 9039.720000000001
be probably in a worse

email me later you to just okay that

9075.08 --> 9081.72

9078.72 --> 9084.16
like I would really prefer to do it in

9081.72 --> 9087.438999999998
my evening which would be your

9084.16 --> 9091.68
afternoon this weekend like later today

9091.68 --> 9098.92

all cool I'm glad you showed

9102.399 --> 9108.519999999999
up thank you thank you for showing up in

9105.8 --> 9111.24
my chat I really appreciate it and don't

9108.52 --> 9113.359
forget to rogin it up

9111.24 --> 9116.96
I mean the first part of the show was

9113.359 --> 9116.960000000001
interesting it really

9117.16 --> 9125.439
was and then it kind of like

9120.6 --> 9125.439
just got really

9127.68 --> 9132.92
silent clear had some really interesting

9130.6 --> 9136.880000000001
sources and

9132.92 --> 9138.76
stuff I got into Rudolph Steiner and and

9136.88 --> 9141.839999999998
then everything just like completely

9138.76 --> 9141.84
died off for some reason

9144.359 --> 9147.04
is really

9157.2 --> 9163.479000000001
disappointing don't know where the hell

9159.279 --> 9163.479000000001
g h suddenly went

9171.56 --> 9177.399
I did like tell him I did not appreciate

9174.8 --> 9180.679999999998
him joking

9177.399 --> 9183.88
around when I'm talking about Christ

9180.68 --> 9183.880000000001
because I don't think it's a

9184.88 --> 9189.679999999998
joke think he did not appreciate that

9187.72 --> 9193.438999999998
but I mean I mean it I don't like it

9189.68 --> 9193.439
when people like joke around about

9194.359 --> 9200.279
Jesus right don't be dogmatic about him

9197.479 --> 9202.358999999999
and all that but still

9200.279 --> 9206.279
a natural

9202.359 --> 9206.279
default respect would

9207.319 --> 9215.199999999999
be is kind of essential for

9211.52 --> 9218.76
me like I don't like people that mock

9215.2 --> 9218.76
Christ I really

9227.24 --> 9233.56
don't ah opens it up eight nice

9305.24 --> 9310.72
right so yeah I think I'm going to round

9307.56 --> 9313.6
out the show unless I don't know look to

9310.72 --> 9316.399
win de bable D maybe you have some more

9313.6 --> 9316.399000000001
input

9316.52 --> 9321.640000000001
Frank I curing Hypocrites wary

9321.96 --> 9326.278999999999
so I think blue pill evolution is just

9324.04 --> 9330.080000000002
still in his morning routine right now

9326.279 --> 9332.0
I'm not expecting him to have continuous

9330.08 --> 9334.2
conversation but yeah we're two and a

9332.0 --> 9337.359
half hours in I could still go another

9334.2 --> 9339.960000000001
half hour maybe more or I'm going to

9337.359 --> 9339.960000000001
round out the

9344.64 --> 9348.56
show I'll give you guys a

9348.64 --> 9351.88
minute to

9355.92 --> 9360.72
respond and then I genuinely hope that

9360.8 --> 9365.56
tomorrow will be a little bit more

9366.2 --> 9371.439
activity and also I think I'm like

9369.24 --> 9375.68
really going to actively try to figure

9371.439 --> 9375.68
out a subject to talk about

9384.24 --> 9388.76
floid had a guy on who's Christian but

9387.12 --> 9391.92
also a

9388.76 --> 9394.359
Mason PJ and Keith got upset saying

9391.92 --> 9396.6
who's blaspheming the whole how how was

9394.359 --> 9399.359
he blaspheming the whole

9396.6 --> 9401.399000000001
time difficult to

9399.359 --> 9404.08
watch

9401.399 --> 9406.358999999999
okay well maybe maybe that's why

9404.08 --> 9408.52
everybody's so inactive than debatable D

9406.359 --> 9410.960000000001
because they just watched flat soid show

9408.52 --> 9413.0
and they got all so [Â __Â ] dry from their

9410.96 --> 9416.119999999999
spirit so they're all depleted and

9413.0 --> 9418.52
depressed and dysfunctional so they

9416.12 --> 9420.800000000001
can't show up at the Flat Earth early

9418.52 --> 9420.800000000001
bird

9423.92 --> 9429.68
show yeah well that's overall why I

9427.16 --> 9431.8
recommend not to watch flat soid

9429.68 --> 9434.439
show

9431.8 --> 9438.199999999999
cuz it

9434.439 --> 9441.64
sucks yeah my show can be kind of boring

9438.2 --> 9443.720000000001
sometimes I know no I fully admit it can

9441.64 --> 9445.72
be a little bit boring

9443.72 --> 9450.479
sometimes can

9445.72 --> 9453.16
be a big tedious when especially when I

9450.479 --> 9456.599999999999
don't feel good or I'm like going to

9453.16 --> 9459.359
there's like a weird Haze of Despair in

9456.6 --> 9462.12
a way and yeah that sucks I get it and I

9459.359 --> 9467.640000000001
mean I do an every freaking day show

9462.12 --> 9470.960000000001
solo every day every damn day yeah for

9467.64 --> 9472.84
like almost a decade it's crazy but I do

9470.96 --> 9475.839999999998
it and that happens

9472.84 --> 9475.84
sometimes

9480.12 --> 9485.880000000001
but I mean I like my show way better

9483.479 --> 9487.96
than flat SIDS because with flatso like

9485.88 --> 9491.0
I have to turn it

9487.96 --> 9493.679999999998
off it like I can't even like just leave

9491.0 --> 9497.68
it in the background and not pay

9493.68 --> 9500.68
attention I have to turn it off CU it

9497.68 --> 9500.68
sucks

9501.12 --> 9508.720000000001
flat side debated Brena last night Jesus

9504.2 --> 9508.720000000001
Christ no wonder everybody's all

9510.04 --> 9516.359
depleted Brena is like one of the worst

9513.0 --> 9516.359
anti-flat earthers on the

9521.2 --> 9530.16
internet Rie dny folkner before theat Oh

9525.92 --> 9532.319
goodie everybody reviews Danny fogner QE

9530.16 --> 9535.52
reviews Danny fogner has been doing that

9532.319 --> 9535.519999999999
for like

9536.24 --> 9541.88
weeks because Danny fuler is saying a

9538.88 --> 9541.88
lot of ridiculous

9544.0 --> 9549.0
things so I get

9546.2 --> 9552.439
it not very original

9549.0 --> 9556.2
though could you imagine that I'd like

9552.439 --> 9560.56
okay guys today I'm going to review a

9556.2 --> 9560.560000000001
video from Danny fauler

9560.72 --> 9565.16
oh would you all tune in to see that to

9564.2 --> 9567.960000000001
watch

9565.16 --> 9572.279
that or would you be

9567.96 --> 9575.0
like not another [Â __Â ] freaking Flat

9572.279 --> 9577.560000000001
Earth reviewing Danny Faulkner why would

9575.0 --> 9579.76
it be what would your response

9577.56 --> 9583.119999999999
be not that I'm going to do it though

9579.76 --> 9586.880000000001
because I don't review other people's

9583.12 --> 9590.880000000001
videos on my stream I never

9586.88 --> 9596.679999999998
have it's very unlikely that I ever

9590.88 --> 9596.679999999998
will I'll mention things I'll link you

9596.88 --> 9604.24
up

9598.56 --> 9607.199999999999
paraphrase I'll explain but I don't play

9604.24 --> 9611.199999999999
videos like

9607.2 --> 9611.2
that unless they're very

9612.68 --> 9617.319
short but I don't play it put it on

9615.279 --> 9618.880000000001
pause and give my commentary I've never

9617.319 --> 9619.92
really done that and I'm never really

9618.88 --> 9623.519999999999
going to do

9619.92 --> 9623.52
that but could you

9624.16 --> 9628.24
imagine what would your response

9642.2 --> 9651.16
be but only if I do it in that voice the

9646.319 --> 9653.88
whole what you mean in my silly

9651.16 --> 9653.88
my silly

9655.12 --> 9661.6
voice oh Danny

9657.88 --> 9664.199999999999
fer oh look I'm a Christian I'm a

9661.6 --> 9664.2
Christian

9665.04 --> 9671.92
glober I could probably do that but I

9667.84 --> 9671.92
mean I'd like

9680.319 --> 9684.278999999999
I mean it would just be completely

9684.359 --> 9690.52
silly I think it's best to leave that

9687.2 --> 9692.84
kind of reviewing to qwi when he does it

9690.52 --> 9695.16
I mean I do

9692.84 --> 9697.6
laugh until the point where he just

9695.16 --> 9700.359
starts to get really angry and then it's

9697.6 --> 9700.359
not really funny

9703.6 --> 9710.359
anymore I have biblical evidence for a

9706.88 --> 9715.278999999999
molten iron core oh I'm Denny ful oh I'm

9710.359 --> 9718.960000000001
so smart I'm such a intellectual

9715.279 --> 9722.24
reliable Christian

9718.96 --> 9724.479
person that never paraphrases things

9722.24 --> 9727.16
incorrectly or

9724.479 --> 9729.56
anything I really know what I'm talking

9727.16 --> 9732.92
about that's why I never contradict

9729.56 --> 9736.278999999999
myself even within the same

9732.92 --> 9738.64
sentence and never do that cuz I'm Denny

9736.279 --> 9741.16
Faulkner I always get everything right

9738.64 --> 9741.16
I'm an

9761.24 --> 9767.68
ual Q Fe has resting silly voice what

9764.96 --> 9773.358999999999
the hell does that even mean

9767.68 --> 9773.359
resting you mean resting silly voice

9781.359 --> 9785.92
what that I don't understand that

9786.439 --> 9790.68
English have you heard anything by the

9788.76 --> 9793.319
way from q and Fe because I thought that

9790.68 --> 9795.08
I was in contact with me with him over

9793.319 --> 9798.519999999999
Skype but he's just

9795.08 --> 9801.12
like not talked back in like two months

9798.52 --> 9801.12
now

9801.279 --> 9806.76
that voice the whole stream reviewing

9817.56 --> 9822.6
okay stream reviewing Kent Hoven

9826.16 --> 9833.319
ah I mean Kent Hoven is is pretty cool

9830.16 --> 9836.359
when it comes to creationism though but

9833.319 --> 9838.479
like sometimes he gets all barded it it

9836.359 --> 9841.640000000001
really reminds me of like Alex Jones

9838.479 --> 9843.72
when Alex Jones gets full barded he had

9841.64 --> 9846.72
a moment like that yesterday too where

9843.72 --> 9849.319
he he genuinely thought Alex Jones came

9846.72 --> 9851.08
on the and he genuinely thought he was

9849.319 --> 9854.359
being

9851.08 --> 9857.12
intellectual describing things about

9854.359 --> 9862.399000000001
planets and and how that works and like

9857.12 --> 9867.880000000001
it was just like oh my God oh Alex oh oh

9862.399 --> 9870.0
oh it's so dumb it's so [Â __Â ] dumb

9867.88 --> 9872.72
that you think you're smart saying that

9870.0 --> 9872.72
it's

9873.24 --> 9879.96
just like cringe doesn't even begin to

9877.279 --> 9882.319000000001
describe the Sensation that I feel when

9879.96 --> 9883.72
Alex Jones tries to be smart with this

9882.319 --> 9888.96
globe

9883.72 --> 9888.96
talk it's so embarrassing

9901.479 --> 9905.319
just means the voice comes naturally

9903.6 --> 9908.319
without putting effort in

9905.319 --> 9908.319
it

9909.8 --> 9916.358999999999
okay well I have a lot of silly voices

9912.8 --> 9916.358999999999
that come naturally

9919.24 --> 9924.72
all my voices come naturally like you

9921.479 --> 9924.72
think that I'm like oh

9925.2 --> 9932.08
wait no it's just every voice I do comes

9929.359 --> 9935.279
naturally every silly

9932.08 --> 9938.72
voice it's like the tension the

9935.279 --> 9942.359
intention the tension has to arrive and

9938.72 --> 9945.84
then it's just I just said it and it it

9942.359 --> 9945.84
becomes it just

9945.96 --> 9954.358999999999
happens I don't have to prep any voice I

9950.64 --> 9957.08
do everything all the voices all that I

9954.359 --> 9959.6
do come

9957.08 --> 9962.96
natural it's like the

9959.6 --> 9965.960000000001
intention the tension for it is

9962.96 --> 9970.358999999999
there in a way when I do a silly voice

9965.96 --> 9974.438999999998
it's acting out I'm venting

9970.359 --> 9978.52
frustration tension builds all I have to

9974.439 --> 9980.319
do is like set myself basically set it

9978.52 --> 9982.24
into the that voice setting and

9980.319 --> 9984.08
everything goes fully automatic after

9982.24 --> 9987.479
that

9984.08 --> 9989.96
point that's that's just how I work

9987.479 --> 9993.8
always work like

9989.96 --> 9996.358999999999
this you have to prepare to do a silly

9993.8 --> 10000.278999999999
voice yeah I

9996.359 --> 10003.84
don't I just have to have the

10000.279 --> 10005.2
intention the tension for it the

10003.84 --> 10008.960000000001
basically the

10005.2 --> 10011.04
nuisance that agitates me has to arrive

10008.96 --> 10013.039999999999
and then I will just automatically

10011.04 --> 10018.160000000002
switch to silly

10013.04 --> 10018.160000000002
voice which could be silly in different

10018.439 --> 10024.76
ways including like mimicking somebody's

10021.84 --> 10024.76
the way somebody

10029.2 --> 10034.720000000001
talks I mean if somebody has a naturally

10032.279 --> 10037.960000000001
squeaky voice then I will go to the

10034.72 --> 10040.96
squeaky voice if somebody's like really

10037.96 --> 10042.72
trying always trying talk bombastic then

10040.96 --> 10046.96
I'll do a silly voice in a more

10042.72 --> 10048.96
bombastic way and like I have

10046.96 --> 10050.08
maneuverability with what I can do with

10048.96 --> 10053.599999999999
my

10050.08 --> 10055.72
voice but the intention has to be there

10053.6 --> 10060.16
the tension has to build

10055.72 --> 10064.519999999999
up in order for me to utilize those

10060.16 --> 10067.08
Dynamics I can't utilize my Dynamics

10064.52 --> 10069.720000000001
from a neutral vantage point I can't

10067.08 --> 10073.439
just conjure a voice out of absolutely

10069.72 --> 10073.438999999998
nothing like a clown

10073.52 --> 10078.800000000001
would it just doesn't work with me like

10075.88 --> 10082.08
that it has to be some kind of

10078.8 --> 10084.399
nuisance that that triggers me to be

10082.08 --> 10087.72
able to do that

10084.399 --> 10090.16
really like if I do a silly voice it's

10087.72 --> 10095.84
going to be in response to something

10090.16 --> 10095.84
never just out of the blue never

10107.88 --> 10113.92
but man Danny fauler is certainly

10110.319 --> 10116.278999999999
somebody that does like really trigger

10113.92 --> 10118.08
my voice and he doesn't even have an

10116.279 --> 10121.399000000001
interesting Voice or anything he doesn't

10118.08 --> 10124.24
have any specific traits he's just

10121.399 --> 10128.039999999999
really really

10124.24 --> 10129.88
delusional like full Boomer Ballard Full

10128.04 --> 10132.720000000001
on

10129.88 --> 10136.16
and it's like he thinks he's a Christian

10132.72 --> 10139.24
but holy [Â __Â ] he's like barely holding

10136.16 --> 10142.88
it together in that

10139.24 --> 10145.56
sense it's ridiculous the guy is like

10142.88 --> 10148.56
ridiculous and he actually thinks that

10145.56 --> 10153.88
he is cohesive he thinks that he is in

10148.56 --> 10153.88
control it's like just Boomer

10154.24 --> 10160.0
syndrome really

10156.239 --> 10162.52
bad like when Owen Benjamin he he talks

10160.0 --> 10165.319
about like Boomer syndrome these days

10162.52 --> 10165.319000000001
which includes

10165.72 --> 10172.119999999999
balart Danny fogner is like the perfect

10168.56 --> 10172.119999999999
example of that Boomer

10174.439 --> 10180.64
syndrome holding on to and believing

10177.2 --> 10182.84
really absurd things that are like

10180.64 --> 10184.119999999999
embarrassingly obvious to figure out

10182.84 --> 10186.56
that it's

10184.12 --> 10189.560000000001
nonsense well that's Danny fauler in a

10186.56 --> 10189.56
nutshell

10193.16 --> 10197.2
you think they put something in Boomer's

10195.16 --> 10202.68
breakfast cereal back in the

10197.2 --> 10202.68
day oh God maybe

10232.359 --> 10237.960000000001
maybe they put like GPH aite in or

10234.52 --> 10239.52
something I mean those times were times

10237.96 --> 10241.16
where there was a lot

10239.52 --> 10243.399000000001
of

10241.16 --> 10245.76
experimental

10243.399 --> 10248.039999999999
chemicals that were getting developed

10245.76 --> 10250.04
and figured out like that was the time

10248.04 --> 10252.640000000001
for it

10250.04 --> 10255.319000000001
people have been subjected like

10252.64 --> 10258.64
including to like DDT and all that which

10255.319 --> 10260.72
turned out to have like terrible

10258.64 --> 10262.64
consequences but you have to realize

10260.72 --> 10266.199999999999
like mid 20th

10262.64 --> 10268.599999999999
century there was a lot of

10266.2 --> 10270.880000000001
that there was a lot of chemical

10268.6 --> 10274.56
developments and

10270.88 --> 10276.199999999999
experiments with it in agriculture and

10274.56 --> 10279.68
in food

10276.2 --> 10282.239000000001
and people were just subjected to

10279.68 --> 10287.56
it just like

10282.239 --> 10291.88
that with horrendous results sometimes M

10287.56 --> 10293.0
like grow M formations Etc ethal

10291.88 --> 10294.56
poisoning

10293.0 --> 10298.64
perhaps

10294.56 --> 10298.64
what that's called

10299.399 --> 10306.88
alcohol from the fuel ethanol is alcohol

10302.88 --> 10306.88
you realize that right

10321.439 --> 10327.800000000001
no but it might be a combination of

10325.0 --> 10331.56
just not enough

10327.8 --> 10336.96
nutrients too much sugar

10331.56 --> 10339.96
and like chemical dyes in food just like

10336.96 --> 10342.919999999998
terrible chemicals

10339.96 --> 10345.119999999999
combination with really false

10342.92 --> 10349.12
promises

10345.12 --> 10352.52
and world big cause for Boomer syndrome

10349.12 --> 10355.479000000001
is like the moonlanding media propaganda

10352.52 --> 10359.0
so it's a combination of chemicals bad

10355.479 --> 10359.0
food media

10364.72 --> 10369.96
propaganda and the spirit of the times I

10367.479 --> 10373.358999999999
mean it was a curse for everybody back

10369.96 --> 10376.88
then it's like this culmination of this

10373.359 --> 10380.92
satanic opportunity to become totally

10376.88 --> 10383.92
disconnected to God and

10380.92 --> 10386.279
delusional and then when you get that

10383.92 --> 10389.2
disconnected to God which means like

10386.279 --> 10392.319000000001
disconnected to truth and reality like

10389.2 --> 10395.640000000001
having a logical connection and feel for

10392.319 --> 10399.119999999999
reality itself when you lose that you

10395.64 --> 10401.8
could later become a Christian so

10399.12 --> 10403.800000000001
supposedly but you'll never get that

10401.8 --> 10407.16
feeling back because it's like a

10403.8 --> 10409.8
destruction of intuition

10407.16 --> 10413.72
itself when you damage that especially

10409.8 --> 10416.399
when you're young you don't get it

10413.72 --> 10419.679999999998
back and I think that's part of Boomer

10416.399 --> 10422.72
syndrome is that they they got damage on

10419.68 --> 10425.880000000001
an intuitive level at a very young age

10422.72 --> 10428.438999999998
so badly that they're just disjointed

10425.88 --> 10431.399
with reality itself and even if they try

10428.439 --> 10432.800000000001
to get back onto reality they'll never

10431.399 --> 10436.72
be good at

10432.8 --> 10436.72
it they'll always be

10437.04 --> 10445.160000000002
disconnected they will barely be able to

10440.92 --> 10447.8
do it just by having been taught how how

10445.16 --> 10452.2
you should do it the intuition just

10447.8 --> 10452.199999999999
won't work properly because it was

10455.6 --> 10460.319
damaged gas fumes make well blue pill

10458.76 --> 10462.64
Evolution I think that

10460.319 --> 10464.96
you're I think that you got it slightly

10462.64 --> 10467.519999999999
wrong what was an issue back then blue

10464.96 --> 10471.438999999998
pill was that

10467.52 --> 10471.439
gasoline had lead in

10472.04 --> 10477.640000000001
it gasoline had lead in it by the way up

10475.279 --> 10477.640000000001
to the

10478.84 --> 10484.960000000001
80s right and the

10481.88 --> 10489.119999999999
lead came three

10484.96 --> 10492.239
through burning them burning it in car

10489.12 --> 10494.6
and people would be influenced by the

10492.239 --> 10497.56
lead that was in

10494.6 --> 10500.0
fuel so that might be part of it right

10497.56 --> 10503.119999999999
and that's just one of the things

10500.0 --> 10504.72
there's many of these types of weird

10503.12 --> 10507.439
chemical

10504.72 --> 10510.92
issues that were all over the middle of

10507.439 --> 10512.76
the 20th century that poisoned everybody

10510.92 --> 10515.279
from all directions and people never

10512.76 --> 10518.399
even realized it because there was just

10515.279 --> 10522.84
no environmental regulations at all

10518.399 --> 10527.08
while there was a chemical development

10522.84 --> 10531.319
Bo Bloom Boomer yeah big boom in a lot

10527.08 --> 10534.92
of chemical options but no regulations

10531.319 --> 10539.0
and so a lot of people had toxic

10534.92 --> 10543.64
influences that kind of sneaked in and

10539.0 --> 10543.64
lead in gasoline was one of

10546.96 --> 10553.759999999998
them they in churchianity and the globe

10550.6 --> 10553.76
well that's what you end up

10556.479 --> 10559.479
with

10560.72 --> 10567.358999999999
clear right but L def yeah people get

10564.12 --> 10571.359
angry and hostile back then well guess

10567.359 --> 10574.68
what lead does that's exactly what lead

10571.359 --> 10579.16
does makes you lose concentration and it

10574.68 --> 10579.16
actually influences you aggressively

10581.8 --> 10587.84
like lead poisoning leads to agitated

10585.6 --> 10593.279
mind I remember

10587.84 --> 10593.279
correctly so that actually matches

10634.2 --> 10639.52
right that cross up yeah no no but

10637.88 --> 10641.438999999998
thanks for reminding me I had completely

10639.52 --> 10642.239
forgotten about that that that was once

10641.439 --> 10647.84
an

10642.239 --> 10647.84
issue lead in fuel how crazy is that

10649.2 --> 10656.319000000001
now and it's been like taken care of for

10653.04 --> 10659.2
40 years my entire life pretty much when

10656.319 --> 10661.56
I was really young it was still there

10659.2 --> 10665.960000000001
but then they like really actively

10661.56 --> 10669.84
phased it out basically forbid lad to be

10665.96 --> 10669.839999999998
put in gasoline

10671.239 --> 10675.68
that's right regular and UNL it

10675.76 --> 10681.52
exactly now it's no more Le it there's

10679.08 --> 10683.439
no more lead in it it's forbidden at

10681.52 --> 10686.359
least in Europe I don't know how it is

10683.439 --> 10690.479000000001
in the UK in the United States I have no

10686.359 --> 10693.800000000001
idea usually when there's something like

10690.479 --> 10696.119999999999
environmentally forbidden in Europe I

10693.8 --> 10698.278999999999
always assume that that means it's still

10696.12 --> 10701.2
legal in the US because the US is is

10698.279 --> 10704.439
just like really fond of like subjecting

10701.2 --> 10710.399000000001
their people to the the worst possible

10704.439 --> 10710.399
chemicals they could ever get together

10742.84 --> 10746.439
right anyway glad to have this

10744.52 --> 10750.08
conversation with you

10746.439 --> 10752.399
to didn't think I would I really thought

10750.08 --> 10753.439
like a an hour ago that it would be the

10752.399 --> 10756.96
end of the

10753.439 --> 10759.64
show but I mean this is this is good I

10756.96 --> 10762.319
like talking about this

10759.64 --> 10766.56
stuff bringing

10762.319 --> 10766.56
up memories of how it

10768.359 --> 10774.439
was and it's kind of funny because it's

10771.04 --> 10777.080000000002
like I I got like a category system of

10774.439 --> 10780.439
like what happened in the 20th

10777.08 --> 10783.6
century in which the age in which I

10780.439 --> 10785.800000000001
actually lived also is a part of that a

10783.6 --> 10788.52
category

10785.8 --> 10791.039999999999
system but

10788.52 --> 10795.560000000001
it really doesn't seem to matter whether

10791.04 --> 10798.92
I liveed then or not for the category

10795.56 --> 10800.92
system so sometimes it's just like yeah

10798.92 --> 10804.2
in the 50s this and this happened and it

10800.92 --> 10807.319
feels like I was there but of course I

10804.2 --> 10809.84
wasn't there but it's still when I think

10807.319 --> 10811.16
about it it feels like it was and

10809.84 --> 10813.319
sometimes it feels like when I talk

10811.16 --> 10817.399
about Rudolph Steiner and like the time

10813.319 --> 10821.08
when he was there doing things or like

10817.399 --> 10824.399
prear Nazi Germany it just almost feels

10821.08 --> 10827.439
like I was actually there it's

10824.399 --> 10829.92
weird but that is how I experience it

10827.439 --> 10833.12
it's just a feeling though the sensation

10829.92 --> 10838.12
like yeah I was there like uh no I

10833.12 --> 10838.12
wasn't but it feels like I was

10845.399 --> 10850.519999999999
weird if only you lived on the East

10847.72 --> 10853.399
Coast you'll be more lively on a regular

10850.52 --> 10858.6
basis yeah but

10853.399 --> 10858.599999999999
you you wouldn't have as good a weather

10867.8 --> 10872.84
though don't worry about it evolu I'm

10871.12 --> 10875.12
glad you're here now for a moment it's

10872.84 --> 10878.52
just

10875.12 --> 10880.92
that before there was like like 20

10878.52 --> 10884.560000000001
minutes of silence in the chat like 20

10880.92 --> 10884.56
minutes is just way

10886.88 --> 10893.599999999999
Overkill I can get kind of agitated from

10890.64 --> 10895.479
five minutes but 20 minutes is just like

10893.6 --> 10897.279
that's just that just feels like a

10895.479 --> 10900.519999999999
straight out

10897.279 --> 10902.76
insult from everybody it's like yeah

10900.52 --> 10905.6
[Â __Â ] Arwin [Â __Â ] him and his show we

10902.76 --> 10908.6
don't show up [Â __Â ] him like that's what

10905.6 --> 10911.319
that feels like

10908.6 --> 10913.640000000001
Florida you could do Florida if you can

10911.319 --> 10917.8
find the spot

10913.64 --> 10917.8
there I mean Florida is

10919.439 --> 10923.64
great it's a bit expensive

10924.279 --> 10929.16
though it's become more

10926.88 --> 10932.8
popular also you have to deal with

10929.16 --> 10932.8
tornado season

10939.88 --> 10943.199999999999
all right but yeah I

10943.479 --> 10949.16
mean you don't have to move just so you

10946.68 --> 10953.359
could be there on the early bird show I

10949.16 --> 10956.0
really it that sounds really ridiculous

10953.359 --> 10958.12
right I mean if you just happen to live

10956.0 --> 10960.08
there because it's like you wanted to

10958.12 --> 10965.399000000001
anyway that's

10960.08 --> 10965.399
cool but yeah it is expensive there

10976.439 --> 10982.239
but I mean there is good opportunity

10978.84 --> 10982.239
there as well

11003.12 --> 11008.560000000001
wait you say it's expensive

11005.8 --> 11011.119999999999
here yeah California has become very

11008.56 --> 11017.519999999999
expensive and it's a

11011.12 --> 11017.52
mess got lots of Migrant issues

11018.319 --> 11024.319
now and crazy junkies just hanging on

11021.96 --> 11027.278999999999
the street all day it's it's become

11024.319 --> 11029.16
pretty bad especially in the bigger city

11027.279 --> 11032.319000000001
regions

11029.16 --> 11034.68
from what I've heard I'm sure it's been

11032.319 --> 11038.8
exaggerated but I mean

11034.68 --> 11038.800000000001
still not an overall good

11047.8 --> 11051.16
situation right anyway I'm going to take

11049.64 --> 11053.479
a two-minute break and I'll be right

11051.16 --> 11056.039999999999
back and then probably going to move

11053.479 --> 11059.72
maneuver towards rounding out the show

11056.04 --> 11059.720000000001
anyway be right back

11086.64 --> 11089.64
for

11116.64 --> 11120.68
e e

11154.52 --> 11159.560000000001
and I'm

11156.52 --> 11163.319000000001
back oh you're one of most expensive oh

11159.56 --> 11163.319
Jesus okay that

11165.84 --> 11170.960000000001
sucks even the cheaper parts of San

11168.399 --> 11170.96
Diego are

11172.56 --> 11179.519999999999
expensive but what are you doing there

11175.6 --> 11179.52
then really

11190.0 --> 11197.52
I mean if you got good

11192.56 --> 11197.519999999999
business I get it I guess

11216.52 --> 11222.12
oh you love the weather okay fair

11219.6 --> 11224.76
enough so is it thriving a lot on

11222.12 --> 11224.76
tourism

11236.52 --> 11240.479000000001
then e

11268.319 --> 11272.16
San Diego is very

11270.52 --> 11276.960000000001
diverse

11272.16 --> 11276.96
uh what do you mean

11281.8 --> 11292.319
diverse that can

11284.76 --> 11292.319
mean oh tour biotch oh okay

11292.56 --> 11296.56
biotch okay

11318.2 --> 11322.12
construction economically

11323.2 --> 11327.2
okay right

11351.84 --> 11355.0
anyhow I think I'm going to round out

11353.76 --> 11358.16
the

11355.0 --> 11361.439
show I'm really glad that you're still

11358.16 --> 11365.88
that you joined me up though in the end

11361.439 --> 11365.880000000001
BL Evolution certainly calmed me down a

11366.72 --> 11374.199999999999
lot oh god

11369.96 --> 11377.039999999999
really mRNA technology was developed

11374.2 --> 11380.68
there well

11377.04 --> 11380.68
goody thanks a

11385.76 --> 11392.08
lot that turns out to be uh quite the

11393.56 --> 11397.56
disaster like talk about

11400.319 --> 11404.96
dysfunctional

11401.88 --> 11407.599999999999
anyway right I am rounding out the show

11404.96 --> 11410.399
yeah blue pill please do come back to me

11407.6 --> 11411.6
about like when you want to do a a night

11410.399 --> 11415.358999999999
ow show

11411.6 --> 11417.68
together talking over Skype I really do

11415.359 --> 11420.239
would like to do that this week weekend

11417.68 --> 11420.239
still if

11422.6 --> 11428.640000000001
possible he was skeptical of using them

11426.399 --> 11432.84
yeah

11428.64 --> 11432.84
but he still developed

11434.439 --> 11440.960000000001
it he developed it

11437.56 --> 11442.039999999999
and without the prospect of it actually

11440.96 --> 11444.399
being

11442.04 --> 11446.399000000001
functional like oh I can change this

11444.399 --> 11447.76
like how does that benefit anything at

11446.399 --> 11451.239
this moment

11447.76 --> 11454.16
it doesn't it doesn't at all it might be

11451.239 --> 11456.319
able to make it useful somehow in the

11454.16 --> 11458.84
future once we figure out how all of

11456.319 --> 11461.119999999999
this actually

11458.84 --> 11462.8
works he shouldn't have done it in the

11461.12 --> 11465.560000000001
first instance he should have never

11462.8 --> 11468.438999999998
developed it he should have said like uh

11465.56 --> 11470.92
no no I'm not doing

11468.439 --> 11473.68
that like the only way this could be

11470.92 --> 11477.399
used is as a bioweapon It could only end

11473.68 --> 11480.52
up damaging a lot of things so maybe I'm

11477.399 --> 11483.72
not going to develop this but he did it

11480.52 --> 11488.399000000001
anyway apparently probably for a lot of

11483.72 --> 11488.399
money yeah and thanks a lot for

11495.8 --> 11502.56
that they around in last sometimes make

11498.439 --> 11505.52
bad stuff yeah and I think that

11502.56 --> 11508.519999999999
biotechnology development should be

11505.52 --> 11508.52
forbidden

11509.0 --> 11513.439
it should be forbidden

11514.6 --> 11518.640000000001
universally it's like yeah you just

11517.319 --> 11521.84
don't mess with

11518.64 --> 11524.119999999999
it yeah I mean you want to figure out

11521.84 --> 11527.72
how to like work with stem cells that's

11524.12 --> 11527.720000000001
one thing or like

11527.8 --> 11534.0
uh enhanced fertility right that kind of

11531.16 --> 11537.6
thing basic procedures that have already

11534.0 --> 11541.2
developed in the 20th century like

11537.6 --> 11545.880000000001
enhancement for that perhaps that's fine

11541.2 --> 11549.399000000001
but all this microbiology subcellular

11545.88 --> 11553.16
development it should be like

11549.399 --> 11553.16
permanently banned and

11553.239 --> 11559.199999999999
forbidden like if you do do that and

11556.68 --> 11562.359
then that ends up like damaging stuff

11559.2 --> 11564.800000000001
that should be considered like a

11562.359 --> 11568.12
bioweapon terrorist

11564.8 --> 11571.039999999999
action like forbidden that that's my

11568.12 --> 11573.720000000001
opinion like all this Biol Laboratories

11571.04 --> 11576.359
that do this kind of [Â __Â ] should all be

11573.72 --> 11579.239
closed down worldwide everywhere every

11576.359 --> 11581.56
single one of them should be closed down

11579.239 --> 11581.56
no

11582.0 --> 11587.88
exception like no more development no

11585.399 --> 11590.239
more work in that sense I mean [Â __Â ]

11587.88 --> 11593.679999999998
those jobs [Â __Â ] those people that do

11590.239 --> 11595.6
those jobs yeah high paying jobs to make

11593.68 --> 11599.6
everything

11595.6 --> 11601.800000000001
worse and to detriment life itself on

11599.6 --> 11605.239
the long run

11601.8 --> 11609.64
yeah it's evil it should be forbidden

11605.239 --> 11612.239
those that type of development should be

11609.64 --> 11615.64
forbidden

11612.239 --> 11618.279
entirely there's no positive point that

11615.64 --> 11621.199999999999
can come out of it only negative points

11618.279 --> 11622.76
only destruction of life and it should

11621.2 --> 11625.399000000001
be

11622.76 --> 11627.64
forbidden like it should be forbidden

11625.399 --> 11632.56
like mustard gas is for

11627.64 --> 11632.56
bidden like it should equate to that

11636.88 --> 11642.119999999999
level yeah you can't develop mustard gas

11640.0 --> 11645.239
in the laboratory well you shouldn't be

11642.12 --> 11648.84
able to develop mRNA

11645.239 --> 11652.479
technology in in the lab either like at

11648.84 --> 11652.479
all it should be

11653.399 --> 11660.519999999999
forbidden like no exception forbidden

11657.2 --> 11664.800000000001
like there is no reason ever that could

11660.52 --> 11668.52
be conceived of including imminent

11664.8 --> 11672.0
Extinction perceived to be to engage

11668.52 --> 11672.0
with that like

11673.479 --> 11680.399
ever oh could you name one example blue

11677.2 --> 11682.2
pill Evolution give me one example of

11680.399 --> 11683.239
one of these things they develop that

11682.2 --> 11689.04
are

11683.239 --> 11689.039999999999
helpful just name one one damn thing

11689.84 --> 11696.6
I know you won't be able

11692.56 --> 11696.6
to because there aren't

11709.84 --> 11716.8
any yeah it's like saying like well you

11713.0 --> 11719.08
know what what Monsanto does I'm sure

11716.8 --> 11722.64
that they've developed some things that

11719.08 --> 11725.68
are good oh oh really can you name one

11722.64 --> 11727.358999999999
damn thing can you name one damn thing

11725.68 --> 11732.880000000001
that Monsanto developed that was

11727.359 --> 11735.720000000001
actually good for anything no no you

11732.88 --> 11737.479
can't some Cancer Treatments that's

11735.72 --> 11740.84
hilarious blue pill

11737.479 --> 11740.84
Evolution like

11741.88 --> 11746.119999999999
what it's nonsense

11747.399 --> 11752.68
it makes no damn

11750.239 --> 11755.399
sense yeah and there are cancer

11752.68 --> 11759.08
treatments yeah you don't need Biol

11755.399 --> 11759.08
laabs to treat

11763.08 --> 11769.52
cancer they gave my dad

11766.52 --> 11769.52
something

11770.359 --> 11776.720000000001
okay that was probably something stem

11773.359 --> 11780.359
cell related then cuz that's usually the

11776.72 --> 11784.92
thing that does it that brings you back

11780.359 --> 11788.52
stem cells yeah you don't need biolab

11784.92 --> 11791.76
development to work with stem

11788.52 --> 11794.52
cells like it's already developed it's

11791.76 --> 11797.319
pretty much there it's it's kind of

11794.52 --> 11800.640000000001
basic yeah there's no

11797.319 --> 11803.64
mRNA manipulation or anything involved

11800.64 --> 11805.72
it's just you take one cell and then you

11803.64 --> 11807.68
take another cell you take one the

11805.72 --> 11810.16
inside of a cell you put it in the other

11807.68 --> 11812.479000000001
cell and bloop you got the thing and

11810.16 --> 11816.64
that's it like that's how it

11812.479 --> 11819.64
works that's how they do it it's really

11816.64 --> 11819.64
basic

11824.92 --> 11833.84
yeah I mean that's just basic bio that's

11830.0 --> 11837.439
like 20th century biolab development

11833.84 --> 11840.56
yeah all this modern [Â __Â ] is osed

11837.439 --> 11842.68
research that they do it's all

11840.56 --> 11846.399
detrimental all of

11842.68 --> 11846.399
it all of it is

11846.56 --> 11851.96
detrimental go really expensive yeah

11850.0 --> 11853.479
that's right that sounds like a stem

11851.96 --> 11857.72
cell

11853.479 --> 11860.64
situation stem cells are really

11857.72 --> 11862.64
expensive yeah they usually get them

11860.64 --> 11867.319
from aborted

11862.64 --> 11867.319
fetuses it's really expensive

11878.319 --> 11885.56
yeah but I mean it provably works though

11881.88 --> 11887.72
yeah it's gross oh babies yeah yeah well

11885.56 --> 11889.519999999999
whatever yeah we're just talking about

11887.72 --> 11892.08
things that work and we're talking about

11889.52 --> 11894.239
things that never ever work and that are

11892.08 --> 11895.76
only a

11894.239 --> 11898.0
detriment

11895.76 --> 11900.64
yeah

11898.0 --> 11902.72
biolab research

11900.64 --> 11906.84
development

11902.72 --> 11912.399
now is pretty much

11906.84 --> 11915.52
99.999% detrimental to life all of it

11912.399 --> 11918.358999999999
there's no legitimate development that

11915.52 --> 11921.880000000001
can benefit

11918.359 --> 11925.04
anybody everything that's useful has

11921.88 --> 11927.96
already been developed in the late 20th

11925.04 --> 11931.68
century and you could fine-tune that

11927.96 --> 11934.039999999999
perhaps yeah or you don't need biolab

11931.68 --> 11937.04
research for that hor

11934.04 --> 11937.04
[Â __Â ]

11937.12 --> 11943.439
yeah especially not like DNA

11940.439 --> 11943.439
manipulation

11944.92 --> 11947.92
[Â __Â ]

11953.76 --> 11959.439
anyway yeah I know blue build evolution

11957.0 --> 11963.08
I have a good Clear Sight on this like I

11959.439 --> 11966.52
have genuine interest in Good

11963.08 --> 11968.76
development like in durable

11966.52 --> 11971.439
Investments and like I have a very

11968.76 --> 11973.08
distinct view on it like I think that a

11971.439 --> 11975.84
whole bunch of

11973.08 --> 11979.319
fields of research and development

11975.84 --> 11982.52
should be permanently forbidden and like

11979.319 --> 11984.92
really strictly too not just like oh we

11982.52 --> 11987.359
won't subsidize it it's like no no it's

11984.92 --> 11990.76
forbidden and if we catch you

11987.359 --> 11994.0
doing that you get life in

11990.76 --> 11997.6
prison and if worse you get the death

11994.0 --> 11997.6
penalty yeah to that

11998.08 --> 12005.12
level that's what I think because there

12001.359 --> 12008.04
is just there's Rogue technological

12005.12 --> 12012.0
development that is going to end up

12008.04 --> 12014.960000000001
killing everything and it's

12012.0 --> 12016.96
rampant it's rampant and it needs to

12014.96 --> 12018.88
stop

12016.96 --> 12022.56
needs to stop permanently and there need

12018.88 --> 12026.64
to be worldwide rules to make sure that

12022.56 --> 12029.08
it never continues yeah this is the same

12026.64 --> 12031.0
level as like Dr

12029.08 --> 12033.279
mangala

12031.0 --> 12036.239
research in the

12033.279 --> 12039.76
40s evil

12036.239 --> 12041.88
destructive can only be abused and used

12039.76 --> 12044.479
against humanity in

12041.88 --> 12048.64
life

12044.479 --> 12048.64
yeah it needs to stop

12053.04 --> 12059.439
permanently yeah and I am very much

12056.76 --> 12062.199
convinced that there needs to be a

12059.439 --> 12064.239
worldwide at least Western Medical

12062.199 --> 12065.880000000001
Revolution where

12064.239 --> 12067.96
the

12065.88 --> 12072.8
horrendously

12067.96 --> 12075.278999999999
outdated and Eugenics based allopathic

12072.8 --> 12076.84
standard medical system needs to be

12075.279 --> 12079.399000000001
discarded

12076.84 --> 12080.72
like completely yeah leave the surgeons

12079.399 --> 12085.72
to do what they

12080.72 --> 12089.96
do right surgery is good but everything

12085.72 --> 12092.399
else like regular doctoring and

12089.96 --> 12096.039999999999
pharmaceutical stuff and

12092.399 --> 12100.56
even vaccination industry like it should

12096.04 --> 12100.560000000001
be completely discarded

12112.96 --> 12117.519999999999
and if it's discarded then we can

12115.0 --> 12117.52
continue

12119.08 --> 12123.76
on yeah blue pill Evolution yeah they

12121.6 --> 12125.319
they don't understand like these people

12123.76 --> 12128.92
are just

12125.319 --> 12131.8

years ago so keep

12213.6 --> 12218.880000000001

12251.359 --> 12257.16
scumbags right anyhow sorry about that

12260.64 --> 12265.08
I

12261.84 --> 12267.359
uh was on a roll

12265.08 --> 12270.76
there medical system should be

12267.359 --> 12272.239
completely reformed turned holistic and

12270.76 --> 12276.16
allopathic

12272.239 --> 12279.279
medical control that is eugenics based

12276.16 --> 12280.359
and is reckless should be discarded

12279.279 --> 12284.640000000001
should be

12280.359 --> 12287.76
abandoned rigorously and maybe even

12284.64 --> 12291.96
forbidden forbidden to the health

12287.76 --> 12294.68
hazards and risks that it actually

12291.96 --> 12299.239
poses that's right allopathic medical

12294.68 --> 12302.56
system is a health risk on the public I

12299.239 --> 12302.56
said it because it's

12306.0 --> 12309.0
true

12309.52 --> 12315.12
yeah it should be reformed it should

12312.04 --> 12317.279
become holistic surgery all these things

12315.12 --> 12320.399000000001
all the experience that is has been had

12317.279 --> 12324.16
should definitely be

12320.399 --> 12327.599999999999
retained and

12324.16 --> 12330.039999999999
recategorized so reorder like what is

12327.6 --> 12332.720000000001
actually beneficial to do in what

12330.04 --> 12335.68
situation and just

12332.72 --> 12339.198999999999
reorganize procedures like surgery

12335.68 --> 12342.239
procedures typical things in in specific

12339.199 --> 12345.199
situations based on a more holistic

12342.239 --> 12348.6
understanding instead of brutally

12345.199 --> 12350.319000000001
outdated AIC

12348.6 --> 12352.479000000001
conceptions

12350.319 --> 12356.08
yeah like germ

12352.479 --> 12358.8
Theory heavily outdated Cate never

12356.08 --> 12362.84
applied heavily outdated should never be

12358.8 --> 12366.438999999998
the foundation for any any actions

12362.84 --> 12368.399
ever yeah use terrain Theory instead

12366.439 --> 12372.12
it's just one

12368.399 --> 12373.92
example right and you don't solve

12372.12 --> 12377.560000000001
anything with drugs

12373.92 --> 12381.64
either weird Pharmaceutical

12377.56 --> 12381.64
stuff like it doesn't solve

12381.76 --> 12387.279
anything hey sky Fly Bri good to see

12390.04 --> 12395.6
you yeah it has been ages how are you

12392.6 --> 12395.6
doing

12397.82 --> 12401.878999999999
[Music]

12411.479 --> 12414.72
you got all these Riley

12427.359 --> 12431.92
videos you didn't like him that much did

12432.96 --> 12438.64
you right so yeah there should be

12436.359 --> 12441.720000000001
massive reforms I got elaborate ideas

12438.64 --> 12444.399
for them they're good ideas and they're

12441.72 --> 12448.76
basically just the

12444.399 --> 12454.68
beginning I want a Western World reform

12448.76 --> 12457.439
big like holistic big no exceptions with

12454.68 --> 12460.08
massive amount of persecutions because

12457.439 --> 12463.64
there's been people that

12460.08 --> 12465.96
knowingly engage with the detrimental

12463.64 --> 12468.239
things just to gain control and profit

12465.96 --> 12471.759999999998
and they lied covering things up and

12468.239 --> 12474.359
they should all be brutally

12471.76 --> 12478.08
punished yeah and that means a whole

12474.359 --> 12481.84
bunch of people Millions potentially

12478.08 --> 12484.92
should be brutally punished for the

12481.84 --> 12487.08
wounds long-term damage and wounds

12484.92 --> 12489.88
they've inflicted upon society and

12487.08 --> 12489.88
Humanity as a

12490.0 --> 12496.359
whole needs to

12492.56 --> 12500.198999999999
end needs to end and be forbidden no

12496.359 --> 12500.199
more of that no

12507.08 --> 12515.359
more yeah and that includes the banker

12511.84 --> 12518.76
accomplishes that have made it so that

12515.359 --> 12523.52
have shaped the world to be like that

12518.76 --> 12528.04
funded the anti-human detrimental

12523.52 --> 12528.04
Technologies they should be brutal

12531.08 --> 12537.84
punished cuz they are responsible for

12534.68 --> 12542.6
that they are responsible for how it

12537.84 --> 12542.6
happened and they must be brutally

12543.12 --> 12548.68
punished and when I mean brutal I mean

12545.8 --> 12548.679999999998
death penalty

12553.319 --> 12557.319
level anyway

12559.16 --> 12562.439
there's a lot to be developed a lot to

12561.239 --> 12566.198999999999
be figured

12562.439 --> 12568.08
out it's important to know what is what

12566.199 --> 12570.0
right because when you know what is what

12568.08 --> 12572.08
in the way this world works you can

12570.0 --> 12574.8
still avoid those things that will

12572.08 --> 12578.08
actually destroy you all you have to do

12574.8 --> 12580.92
is know what will destroy you and what

12578.08 --> 12584.239
won't if you know that and you hold tied

12580.92 --> 12586.84
to that knowledge then you cannot be

12584.239 --> 12589.479
mind controlled into accidentally

12586.84 --> 12592.199
getting doing something to yourself that

12589.479 --> 12592.198999999999
will destroy

12593.52 --> 12600.6
you that's the overall scenario for now

12597.68 --> 12603.52
but in the meantime everybody is getting

12600.6 --> 12605.16
financially detriment and burdened by

12603.52 --> 12608.52
the overall scenario in the world

12605.16 --> 12613.16
whether you go along with this or not

12608.52 --> 12618.239
and that Trend cannot be undone until

12613.16 --> 12620.84
the power is unseated from these

12618.239 --> 12623.0
bankers and the

12620.84 --> 12627.12
technocrats and

12623.0 --> 12630.96
the the trotskyite Communist

12627.12 --> 12632.640000000001
politicians and and their following like

12630.96 --> 12637.08
they need to be

12632.64 --> 12640.519999999999
uned and put through trials and punished

12637.08 --> 12644.52
harshly like really harshly set as an

12640.52 --> 12648.16
example cataloged cataloged with their

12644.52 --> 12651.239
actions as like a monument to the Future

12648.16 --> 12653.68
like this type of thing needs to be

12651.239 --> 12657.239
brutally punished there needs to be a

12653.68 --> 12660.0
monument for these people to Future

12657.239 --> 12663.0
generations to tell you like this needs

12660.0 --> 12666.359
to be brutally punished every time it

12663.0 --> 12669.279
shows up if you don't everyone

12666.359 --> 12672.76
dies they need to be brutally punished

12669.279 --> 12676.319000000001
and monuments need to be erected

12672.76 --> 12679.800000000001
worldwide to pass on the knowledge of

12676.319 --> 12683.479
what these people do and that you cannot

12679.8 --> 12687.0
be tolerant to them in any

12683.479 --> 12690.92
way monuments need to be erected for

12687.0 --> 12694.76
future Generations specifically for that

12690.92 --> 12697.64
yeah not to tell you what happened no

12694.76 --> 12700.64
specifically Behavior

12697.64 --> 12702.76
strategy and how you need to unroot them

12700.64 --> 12705.76
as quickly as possible without any

12702.76 --> 12705.76
hesitation

12718.92 --> 12724.399
yeah right

12721.08 --> 12726.72
so but for now just knowing what is good

12724.399 --> 12729.399
and what is not good what is only

12726.72 --> 12731.599999999999
detrimental is very important to survive

12729.399 --> 12733.64
through this if you can make it

12731.6 --> 12736.16
financially because that is the the

12733.64 --> 12738.96
thing that if you just leave everything

12736.16 --> 12741.92
be eventually you will crumble and then

12738.96 --> 12744.479
you'll have nothing you'll be a bum on

12741.92 --> 12747.08
the street no matter how much you

12744.479 --> 12749.479
avoided the

12747.08 --> 12751.64
pitfalls you'll have nothing because

12749.479 --> 12756.0
nothing will be there anymore will be

12751.64 --> 12758.64
functional anymore will be valued to

12756.0 --> 12761.16
anything you'll be a peon with

12758.64 --> 12764.439
nothing because it is a Neo feudal

12761.16 --> 12766.84
scenario that's playing out with

12764.439 --> 12769.76
Eugenics on top of that to kill people

12766.84 --> 12772.960000000001
off and they have no durable long-term

12769.76 --> 12775.76
strategy there isn't any yeah when it

12772.96 --> 12778.08
all collaps it it all collapses

12775.76 --> 12781.6
including everything they have and then

12778.08 --> 12783.96
they will collapse and they will die and

12781.6 --> 12786.439
they don't care they don't have a

12783.96 --> 12791.759999999998
durable plan they don't have a durable

12786.439 --> 12794.12
plan to sustain control for themselves

12791.76 --> 12796.880000000001
they're just rolling out a complete

12794.12 --> 12799.479000000001
eugenics

12796.88 --> 12802.56
death operation for the entirety of

12799.479 --> 12803.84
humanity that includes themselves and

12802.56 --> 12809.64
the only

12803.84 --> 12809.64
way that it can stop is if they are

12810.479 --> 12814.56
stopped they they're not even settling

12813.399 --> 12818.84
for

12814.56 --> 12821.6
control they're only settling for

12818.84 --> 12825.6
extermination and so they need to be
