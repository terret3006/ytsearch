the membership system join button

63.039 --> 73.43900000000001
they'll be much appreciated so

68.0 --> 76.799
yeah it's thursday the first

73.439 --> 82.15899999999999
of the month of october

76.799 --> 82.159
right and it's yeah really dreary

82.64 --> 91.52
it's like there's just this constant

87.36 --> 94.479
rain like this very

91.52 --> 97.52
misery type rain it's constantly going

94.479 --> 100.24
it's been going all night

97.52 --> 101.6
it's not the most pleasant of weathers

100.24 --> 103.6
i'm very glad that

101.6 --> 107.36
it wasn't this kind of weather yesterday

103.6 --> 107.36
when i was doing my newspaper round

108.96 --> 114.079
it was kind of cold

112.079 --> 116.79899999999999
but it wasn't raining at least but now

114.079 --> 116.79899999999999
it is so

119.6 --> 121.91999999999999
yuck

122.7 --> 128.479
[Music]

124.88 --> 132.959
so let's use in chat so far

128.479 --> 136.4
good serving in first julio pepin

132.959 --> 139.04
yeah good to see you too i got the green

136.4 --> 139.04
tea with me

141.52 --> 143.84
ah

147.36 --> 157.84
yeah so let's see

152.0 --> 157.84
didn't make a whole lot of notes

158.0 --> 160.959
but i did some

161.04 --> 165.84
uh yeah yesterday's hangout for however

164.08 --> 168.16000000000003
short it was turned out to be pretty

165.84 --> 168.16
good

168.319 --> 174.95899999999997
i uh watched some of it back

171.599 --> 178.79999999999998
and yeah it was interesting

174.959 --> 181.36
um so yeah i might

178.8 --> 184.959
yeah start getting back into that

181.36 --> 189.68
concept again at some point

184.959 --> 189.68
um about the yeah the

190.159 --> 194.239
i guess the spiritual realm divide

192.239 --> 197.44
between heaven and hell

194.239 --> 199.28
in a more physical format and

197.44 --> 202.0
who knows you know i've even conceived

199.28 --> 204.959
before way before that

202.0 --> 206.959
since light is holographic that maybe in

204.959 --> 210.08
the fourth dimension

206.959 --> 212.239
the extra depth through the earth or the

210.08 --> 214.4
heavenly bodies on earth might be

212.239 --> 220.159
represented

214.4 --> 220.159
as a more spatially literal

220.4 --> 225.92000000000002
dome of lights above

223.84 --> 227.36
in the fourth dimension a literal disc

225.92 --> 229.11999999999998
sketch it's get

227.36 --> 230.87900000000002
it gets really odd when you think about

229.12 --> 233.92000000000002
it like that

230.879 --> 237.439
like okay in third dimension things

233.92 --> 240.07999999999998
it's like a looping rectangle but in the

237.439 --> 243.76
fourth dimension

240.08 --> 246.31900000000002
spirits are more real and all that

243.76 --> 246.959
and you see everything i guess from a

246.319 --> 249.04
spirit

246.959 --> 251.28
perspective you would probably be able

249.04 --> 256.15999999999997
to perceive the world

251.28 --> 259.44
from that perspective i think i did

256.16 --> 261.12
it's very confusing though thinking back

259.44 --> 263.36
about it

261.12 --> 265.759
because it was so different and then

263.36 --> 268.0
yeah from that vantage point

265.759 --> 268.8
you could start to imagine a little bit

268.0 --> 272.24
more easy that

268.8 --> 274.56
okay maybe that that literal

272.24 --> 277.28000000000003
disc domed disc in the fourth dimension

274.56 --> 282.16
might be surrounded over there

277.28 --> 284.71999999999997
by heaven and hell above it and below it

282.16 --> 285.36
even though in the third dimension there

284.72 --> 289.04
is

285.36 --> 292.639
no space beyond the looping

289.04 --> 294.72
rectangle like that right

292.639 --> 296.16
but that's like yeah it's it's almost

294.72 --> 298.47900000000004
like einstein

296.16 --> 300.56
mind experimentation it it is kind of

298.479 --> 302.15999999999997
the similar process it just tried

300.56 --> 303.68
i'm trying to describe something

302.16 --> 306.08000000000004
different here

303.68 --> 307.52
so instead of helping the fourth

306.08 --> 310.32
dimension

307.52 --> 311.19899999999996
it being time and then you're supposedly

310.32 --> 314.56
imagining

311.199 --> 317.52000000000004
how the bending of that medium

314.56 --> 318.16
which is conjured space-time is then

317.52 --> 320.88
supposed

318.16 --> 321.68
supposedly causing things to stick to

320.88 --> 325.36
balls

321.68 --> 328.40000000000003
in a fast open vacuum of space

325.36 --> 329.52000000000004
i instead use it to try to make you

328.4 --> 332.96
imagine

329.52 --> 334.56
from a flat world to 3d type of scenario

332.96 --> 337.919
instead

334.56 --> 341.36
with more space so my fourth dimension

337.919 --> 345.59999999999997
is not time it's just

341.36 --> 348.24
more space through and then i use that

345.6 --> 349.6
as a vantage point to try to figure out

348.24 --> 352.639
yeah some of these

349.6 --> 354.32000000000005
i guess amazing components like the

352.639 --> 356.40000000000003
heavenly bodies which seem to be

354.32 --> 359.28
holographic

356.4 --> 360.23999999999995
uh yeah so it's a mind experiment to do

359.28 --> 362.23999999999995
that

360.24 --> 366.8
but at least to me it seems more

362.24 --> 369.12
sensible i don't know about you guys

366.8 --> 372.96000000000004
it's still just a mind experiment

369.12 --> 372.96
because i can't prove it physically

373.68 --> 377.12
i can only point at yeah correlations

376.639 --> 380.639
that i

377.12 --> 384.56
see within the mind experimentation

380.639 --> 395.84000000000003
right the eagle plane and anchor

384.56 --> 395.84
open cool

397.12 --> 400.8
all right good servant i don't know

403.44 --> 408.8
hearing screaming down there

406.8 --> 411.44
yeah that's we i know i don't know if

408.8 --> 411.44
that's real

414.319 --> 417.68
it sounds like it might have been

416.0 --> 421.52
[Music]

417.68 --> 424.319
uh i don't know an up

421.52 --> 426.88
an operation to basically discourage

424.319 --> 430.40000000000003
from continuing

426.88 --> 433.28
because of yeah all the geologists

430.4 --> 434.79999999999995
uh predictions were off right so they it

433.28 --> 437.75899999999996
was just like okay

434.8 --> 439.68
we can't let this continue so let's just

437.759 --> 441.599
play on the superstition of the people

439.68 --> 444.40000000000003
and suggest that there might be hell

441.599 --> 448.479
there that is secretly being covered up

444.4 --> 449.12
do a boo op could have been completely

448.479 --> 452.71999999999997
faked

449.12 --> 455.12
and just then yeah

452.72 --> 457.199
discontinue because of that because

455.12 --> 459.44
everybody is scared supposedly

457.199 --> 459.44
see

460.479 --> 466.479
this thing is like that would be

462.8 --> 470.16
something that i would think up

466.479 --> 470.15999999999997
if i were in that position see

472.879 --> 481.579
all right

478.42 --> 481.579
[Music]

485.67 --> 489.47
[Music]

498.43 --> 501.55
[Music]

501.599 --> 506.71999999999997
and now as a joke by the way i'm

504.96 --> 508.56
when i hear that oh they sent like a

506.72 --> 510.72
tape recorder or whatever

508.56 --> 512.959
i'm just imagining like literally a tape

510.72 --> 516.24
recorder put on record and then being

512.959 --> 517.1999999999999
lowered by a rope an insanely long rope

516.24 --> 520.24
or something that's it

517.2 --> 522.88
yeah and then

520.24 --> 523.36
feeding that back to another situation

522.88 --> 526.08
of

523.36 --> 527.92
like ghost hunting and then using a tape

526.08 --> 530.1600000000001
recorder and then hearing some

527.92 --> 531.68
voice in the noise right and i'm

530.16 --> 533.76
thinking that they might have done

531.68 --> 535.3599999999999
that it's probably not it's probably

533.76 --> 537.68
much more straightforward they really

535.36 --> 540.5600000000001
tried to put in something spooky

537.68 --> 541.76
sounding more overtly but just the idea

540.56 --> 544.399
that

541.76 --> 545.6
oh the ghost hunter sent a tape recorder

544.399 --> 547.44
down there and then they heard

545.6 --> 549.0400000000001
like scratchy noises and they're like oh

547.44 --> 552.9590000000001
there's a ghost in here see

549.04 --> 552.959
we heard a ghost down there it's hell

553.04 --> 556.8
it's it's very unlikely it was actually

555.44 --> 560.6400000000001
like that

556.8 --> 562.0
but that's my my joke mind is thinking

560.64 --> 564.48
that up

562.0 --> 564.48
about it

568.16 --> 571.289
[Music]

572.64 --> 579.6
they stopped digging due to extreme heat

576.72 --> 580.5600000000001
did they i don't think so i think it was

579.6 --> 584.399
because

580.56 --> 588.2399999999999
the yeah the tungsten drill bits

584.399 --> 591.279
were just eroding

588.24 --> 594.16
i don't know if they molted if they

591.279 --> 596.8
can can it even do that after it has

594.16 --> 599.12
been solidified in the drill bit

596.8 --> 600.0
but it did definitely erode while they

599.12 --> 603.279
did

600.0 --> 604.0
like not get any deeper that's what i

603.279 --> 606.079
think

604.0 --> 607.04
happened i don't know about the supposed

606.079 --> 610.3199999999999
2000

607.04 --> 613.5999999999999
degrees excess excessive heat

610.32 --> 615.44
i've never heard about that the whole

613.6 --> 618.32
point was is that they didn't

615.44 --> 619.36
come across this extreme heat and they

618.32 --> 621.279
were supposed to

619.36 --> 623.6
remember because they were supposed to

621.279 --> 625.8389999999999
get closer to the molten iron core

623.6 --> 626.64
but they didn't it didn't get that much

625.839 --> 628.32
hotter

626.64 --> 633.8389999999999
so i don't know where you got that

628.32 --> 633.839
george sanford

643.279 --> 647.8389999999999
tungsten gets hit brittle you say

648.48 --> 657.839
i don't know could be i'm not a

653.76 --> 660.56
drill expert at it i just paid a little

657.839 --> 663.2
attention on the surface details of it

660.56 --> 666.079
could be george sanford

663.2 --> 666.88
but still that's not the story that i

666.079 --> 669.1999999999999
heard

666.88 --> 670.56
i heard that they just couldn't get any

669.2 --> 672.9590000000001
further and it wasn't just

670.56 --> 675.279
it wasn't worth it all the destroyed

672.959 --> 678.16
drill bits and not getting any further

675.279 --> 678.16
that's what i heard

682.72 --> 689.44
what's the strongest well tungsten

685.839 --> 691.12
is this is the strongest known fabric

689.44 --> 703.08
that's why they make these drill bits

691.12 --> 705.68
out of them

703.08 --> 707.519
[Music]

705.68 --> 709.68
it's like tungsten isn't the most

707.519 --> 712.0
friction

709.68 --> 712.0
uh

715.44 --> 719.6800000000001
it yeah it can handle friction the best

718.399 --> 723.279
of all materials

719.68 --> 724.7199999999999
that's that's it that's what it's doing

723.279 --> 726.56
mostly that's what's happening with

724.72 --> 728.839
drill bits it's just friction

726.56 --> 731.8389999999999
and of course heat coming out of that

728.839 --> 731.839
friction

735.2 --> 740.5600000000001
carbide they they combine it with carbon

738.079 --> 743.8389999999999
that makes sense to me

740.56 --> 746.0
because carbon does typically harden

743.839 --> 748.24
just like it does with iron

746.0 --> 752.16
that's how you get steel it hardens

748.24 --> 752.16
metals if it's done in the right

753.519 --> 759.839
in the right division percentage wise

756.48 --> 759.839
the material

769.68 --> 776.7199999999999
right diamond

772.72 --> 779.44
well diamond is extremely hard

776.72 --> 779.76
it's like in but the thing is about it

779.44 --> 784.24
it's

779.76 --> 786.16
in it's it's it's it's directional it's

784.24 --> 790.0
based on the crystalline structure of

786.16 --> 792.079
the diamond so in certain angles

790.0 --> 794.48
a diamond crystal can have like

792.079 --> 796.6389999999999
seemingly unlimited amount of pressure

794.48 --> 800.0
and force

796.639 --> 803.519
right but if you don't have

800.0 --> 806.8
the right angle if it it's it's off

803.519 --> 808.399
then it can actually break diamonds

806.8 --> 810.16
aren't unbreakable

808.399 --> 812.32
it's just that because of the

810.16 --> 813.04
crystalline structure on certain types

812.32 --> 816.32
of

813.04 --> 819.4399999999999
angles it's just unbreakable

816.32 --> 821.1990000000001
but if you get it from another angle

819.44 --> 823.12
yet but i don't know there's people that

821.199 --> 826.079
know how that works even

823.12 --> 826.9590000000001
that's how i think originally with real

826.079 --> 829.5999999999999
diamonds they

826.959 --> 830.4799999999999
know how to fracture it how to basically

829.6 --> 834.0
split it up

830.48 --> 836.72
into yeah into a

834.0 --> 838.56
into sizable chunks which they will cut

836.72 --> 839.9200000000001
diamonds from because if they just have

838.56 --> 842.6389999999999
to take a blob

839.92 --> 843.279
of diamond as they find it and then cut

842.639 --> 846.24
that all

843.279 --> 847.519
down just shaving it off that's an

846.24 --> 850.639
endless task

847.519 --> 854.32
so they can split it up basically

850.639 --> 857.519
literally and then perfect split

854.32 --> 858.399
there's an art to this this in general

857.519 --> 862.48
by the way with

858.399 --> 864.72
uh making gems cutting gems cutting gems

862.48 --> 866.399
you know they call it cutting gems not

864.72 --> 870.9590000000001
shaving

866.399 --> 874.24
gems like eventually when they

870.959 --> 876.88
take the the sides

874.24 --> 878.48
they do kind of like shave it into like

876.88 --> 881.68
this perfect

878.48 --> 885.44
cut but originally they

881.68 --> 888.4799999999999
size down the rock by cutting it

885.44 --> 890.639
so i think if i remember correctly at

888.48 --> 893.519
least with most gems it's how it works

890.639 --> 895.279
and with diamonds yeah you have to

893.519 --> 899.839
really know how to do it because it is

895.279 --> 899.8389999999999
so incredibly hard

906.88 --> 915.36
titanium tooth filling what

911.6 --> 918.639
that that doesn't sound possible

915.36 --> 918.639
because you can't

919.519 --> 924.079
melt tight you like to smell titanium in

923.36 --> 928.9590000000001
a perfect

924.079 --> 928.959
shape is unbelievably tough

930.32 --> 939.12
oh right coating yet to you yeah you can

934.56 --> 939.1199999999999
combine it with other materials

939.68 --> 944.3199999999999
and then it may become a little bit more

941.839 --> 944.32
malleable

947.04 --> 949.68
interesting

953.279 --> 956.399
yeah but titanium hardness is very

955.6 --> 960.75
different from

956.399 --> 962.32
diamond hardness or tungsten hardness

960.75 --> 969.839
[Music]

962.32 --> 969.839
it's like yeah it just works different

980.839 --> 983.839
uh

990.079 --> 999.8389999999999
uh julio pepper what are you

996.56 --> 1001.7589999999999
i had a dream right right that makes

999.839 --> 1003.2790000000001
i thought i didn't read the dream parts

1001.759 --> 1005.759
i was like what

1003.279 --> 1006.48
you actually crapped into a mild deep

1005.759 --> 1008.88
hole

1006.48 --> 1011.1990000000001
like holy [ __ ] dude that's scary as [ __ ]

1008.88 --> 1013.8389999999999
but in a dream that makes sense

1011.199 --> 1015.12
i've had many like subterranean dreams

1013.839 --> 1018.1600000000001
like that too

1015.12 --> 1022.399
and there were scary things there

1018.16 --> 1024.799
but never never screams

1022.399 --> 1027.12
but it's almost like in my dreams when

1024.799 --> 1030.8799999999999
such type of scenarios happened

1027.12 --> 1032.799
with me it was like spiral staircases

1030.88 --> 1035.8390000000002
down

1032.799 --> 1038.079
into the dirt and i used to

1035.839 --> 1038.8799999999999
find things there like caches of

1038.079 --> 1040.8799999999999
diamonds and

1038.88 --> 1042.3190000000002
[ __ ] is like weird dreams interesting

1040.88 --> 1044.4
but but

1042.319 --> 1047.28
it is typical that if you go down you

1044.4 --> 1050.0790000000002
get closer to another frequency

1047.28 --> 1050.079
and i don't know

1050.559 --> 1054.96
i think it would be typically possible

1052.48 --> 1057.679
that if somebody was wide open

1054.96 --> 1059.6000000000001
didn't know how to recognize defend

1057.679 --> 1059.919
against that psionically that they might

1059.6 --> 1062.799
hear

1059.919 --> 1062.7990000000002
screams in their head

1062.96 --> 1070.0
that doesn't surprise me in in dreams

1067.28 --> 1081.84
in the dream mechanics as i've figured

1070.0 --> 1081.84
them out

1082.72 --> 1085.1200000000001
all right

1092.08 --> 1095.84
oh hello the mice kang by the way

1103.2 --> 1109.8400000000001
tiny one more

1120.84 --> 1123.84
hmm

1126.799 --> 1134.32
okay so right yeah drills

1130.72 --> 1138.88
drill deep down in our dreams we hear

1134.32 --> 1141.52
some of us hear screams when you go down

1138.88 --> 1142.24
well that's just telling then isn't it

1141.52 --> 1144.96
that if

1142.24 --> 1146.48
in dreams people i don't know it's

1144.96 --> 1148.16
probably more common that people

1146.48 --> 1149.76
experience something like that that they

1148.16 --> 1153.679
would use that

1149.76 --> 1155.84
as a discouraging operation to suggest

1153.679 --> 1157.2
that they drill down and then they heard

1155.84 --> 1159.4399999999998
screaming

1157.2 --> 1162.799
because that's gonna play into the in

1159.44 --> 1165.8400000000001
into the dream normality of people

1162.799 --> 1165.84
wouldn't you say

1178.08 --> 1181.039
anyway um

1192.64 --> 1195.8400000000001
right yeah big bear was live yesterday

1195.28 --> 1199.44
as well

1195.84 --> 1201.9189999999999
and the life wasn't cutting out as much

1199.44 --> 1203.6000000000001
that's nice but i still can't comment i

1201.919 --> 1206.7990000000002
still don't have the

1203.6 --> 1208.24
channel subscription nobody threw one

1206.799 --> 1211.76
out that i could catch

1208.24 --> 1212.799
unfortunately but i could still throw

1211.76 --> 1215.6
lemons out there

1212.799 --> 1216.96
and yeah big bear was on fire yesterday

1215.6 --> 1221.039
like he had like

1216.96 --> 1223.28
half an hour just straight rant like

1221.039 --> 1225.36
like he kept on going and going full

1223.28 --> 1227.76
energy at so much

1225.36 --> 1229.84
and yeah he had a lot of issues with

1227.76 --> 1230.4
churchians as he likes to call them and

1229.84 --> 1233.6789999999999
i do

1230.4 --> 1237.919
too i do too even though there are some

1233.679 --> 1241.8400000000001
in my chat but i hope i don't seem

1237.919 --> 1244.96
passive because i'm trying not to be

1241.84 --> 1249.12
but i don't want to just like

1244.96 --> 1252.32
to make a point push extra hard

1249.12 --> 1255.28
because it is a sensitive subject but

1252.32 --> 1257.6789999999999
yeah in this case yeah he made a great

1255.28 --> 1260.24
point about

1257.679 --> 1262.0800000000002
yeah the difference between

1260.24 --> 1265.36
communicating and talking to

1262.08 --> 1267.039
and worshiping god the creator and the

1265.36 --> 1269.52
jesus

1267.039 --> 1269.52
figure

1270.32 --> 1275.2
and i don't know if it's he made me

1273.44 --> 1278.0
think about something that i

1275.2 --> 1280.4
haven't really thought about in a direct

1278.0 --> 1280.4
sense

1280.48 --> 1286.4
like that like is a thing that

1283.6 --> 1287.1999999999998
he suggests that there is a divide at

1286.4 --> 1291.44
least

1287.2 --> 1294.4
regionally between

1291.44 --> 1295.919
like when you worship god or when you're

1294.4 --> 1298.4
like when you're taught

1295.919 --> 1299.6000000000001
to communicate with and worship god the

1298.4 --> 1303.44
creator

1299.6 --> 1307.4399999999998
or jesus as an icon and as a figure

1303.44 --> 1310.24
and that that may like

1307.44 --> 1312.159
people that won't understand creation

1310.24 --> 1315.1200000000001
and the complexities of it all and

1312.159 --> 1315.679
the challenge of the creator as much the

1315.12 --> 1319.12
ones that

1315.679 --> 1321.1200000000001
won't get that as they grow up

1319.12 --> 1322.4799999999998
that don't seem to have the faculties to

1321.12 --> 1325.52
understand all that

1322.48 --> 1327.52
to get into that are then shoved towards

1325.52 --> 1329.28
jesus like okay you don't get it well

1327.52 --> 1332.32
just focus on jesus because

1329.28 --> 1335.12
yeah he has good messages and he made a

1332.32 --> 1335.12
good point there

1335.6 --> 1339.1999999999998
that might naturally be going on out

1337.919 --> 1341.76
there

1339.2 --> 1344.24
people grow up if they don't get the

1341.76 --> 1346.96
complexities of the creator and

1344.24 --> 1348.88
the spirits and all that people are just

1346.96 --> 1351.44
told okay then just

1348.88 --> 1352.159
pray to jesus just focus on the figure

1351.44 --> 1355.44
jesus and

1352.159 --> 1355.44
everything he did and that

1355.6 --> 1361.28
and he ranted on about that a long time

1357.84 --> 1366.6399999999999
but he made a really good point with it

1361.28 --> 1366.6399999999999
so so where is everybody in chat

1367.84 --> 1377.1999999999998
six minutes of silence

1374.72 --> 1377.2
hello

1383.52 --> 1389.84
listening all right just six minutes

1385.919 --> 1389.8400000000001
it's a long time

1393.44 --> 1397.44
right but that happened and yeah i could

1396.88 --> 1399.919
just

1397.44 --> 1402.3200000000002
i didn't have to like refresh the page

1399.919 --> 1404.5590000000002
constantly i could just

1402.32 --> 1406.24
think about it walk around in my room do

1404.559 --> 1408.3999999999999
stuff while listening and i love doing

1406.24 --> 1411.84
that

1408.4 --> 1414.48
so yeah i really prefer it that

1411.84 --> 1418.3999999999999
the life completely fixes the the

1414.48 --> 1418.4
bandwidth or connection issues

1419.52 --> 1426.08
or at least makes ensures that

1423.919 --> 1427.76
yeah people aren't pushing the grappler

1426.08 --> 1430.0
button to slow it down

1427.76 --> 1431.76
you know that mechanism that might be

1430.0 --> 1435.36
out there

1431.76 --> 1438.4
suggested it would be good if

1435.36 --> 1440.24
like yeah companies like d life would

1438.4 --> 1443.679
figure out how to

1440.24 --> 1446.159
block that ability from happening

1443.679 --> 1447.76
maybe they did maybe they didn't

1446.159 --> 1451.279
probably didn't

1447.76 --> 1457.919
we'll see in the next streams

1451.279 --> 1460.4
if it starts to get all choppy again

1457.919 --> 1462.64
what was his name

1460.4 --> 1462.64
what

1465.2 --> 1473.8400000000001
what was his name what are you talking

1467.44 --> 1473.8400000000001
about good servant

1484.0 --> 1487.84
owen benjamin big bear

1487.919 --> 1490.72
on d live

1497.12 --> 1504.4799999999998
and he is devoutly logos and christian

1501.44 --> 1506.799
but he too says it

1504.48 --> 1508.72
like yes because of his awakening

1506.799 --> 1511.039
because of his realization he's much

1508.72 --> 1513.52
more just communicating with creation

1511.039 --> 1518.4
with the creator

1513.52 --> 1521.6
that the god more directly in control of

1518.4 --> 1525.2
yeah of everything through energy

1521.6 --> 1525.1999999999998
in the back at the back doors

1525.52 --> 1533.279
then jesus christ and i totally get that

1530.4 --> 1535.2
now i do call upon jesus christ

1533.279 --> 1537.76
especially

1535.2 --> 1538.72
uh yeah concerning my personal journey

1537.76 --> 1541.12
the path

1538.72 --> 1542.559
in in the chant remember the combat

1541.12 --> 1545.9189999999999
chant

1542.559 --> 1546.48
i call upon jesus like i when i call

1545.919 --> 1550.0800000000002
upon

1546.48 --> 1554.0
i call upon jesus i just don't really

1550.08 --> 1555.039
directly call upon god itself that seems

1554.0 --> 1556.48
like

1555.039 --> 1559.919
maybe sounds weird it seems like

1556.48 --> 1562.559
dangerous for somebody like me

1559.919 --> 1563.919
i guess because of my it's like what if

1562.559 --> 1568.24
he listens

1563.919 --> 1569.679
you know got to be careful with what you

1568.24 --> 1572.96
asked for

1569.679 --> 1576.5590000000002
because it's like big it's much bigger

1572.96 --> 1580.159
you know you don't go asking

1576.559 --> 1583.6
the king if maybe yeah you

1580.159 --> 1586.24
the toilet roll could be refreshed

1583.6 --> 1587.4399999999998
that type of setup and of course he

1586.24 --> 1592.64
listens

1587.44 --> 1592.64
it's just that the action of the inquiry

1596.08 --> 1600.559
now i'm not saying that you should ask

1598.08 --> 1602.1589999999999
the spirit of christ to help you change

1600.559 --> 1606.24
the toilet roll

1602.159 --> 1609.5200000000002
of course but jesus seems very much

1606.24 --> 1613.6
designated for mankind even the simpler

1609.52 --> 1614.24
people help them out oh god the creator

1613.6 --> 1617.12
he's

1614.24 --> 1617.76
he's the great game master he's really

1617.12 --> 1622.559
busying

1617.76 --> 1627.84
himself with the bigger picture things

1622.559 --> 1627.84
and destinies and all that

1641.12 --> 1650.08
all right all three are equally god

1646.559 --> 1652.48
yeah they're not the same thing though

1650.08 --> 1653.6
so you yeah that some kind of

1652.48 --> 1656.72
designation

1653.6 --> 1660.1589999999999
right in a playbook some esoteric

1656.72 --> 1664.32
set of rules or rule by three

1660.159 --> 1665.2
tete right yeah that's very nice that's

1664.32 --> 1669.279
a very nice

1665.2 --> 1672.3990000000001
exeteric that you're accepting

1669.279 --> 1676.88
but when it comes to what is jesus

1672.399 --> 1679.039
what is the god creator yeah

1676.88 --> 1680.96
they're not literally the same thing and

1679.039 --> 1683.52
even the the rule of three

1680.96 --> 1684.559
says it isn't it's just that for some

1683.52 --> 1687.76
reason

1684.559 --> 1690.32
requires you to equate it all as equal

1687.76 --> 1691.919
what does that mean nothing it's an

1690.32 --> 1695.2
esoteric

1691.919 --> 1697.279
thing to me and owen benjamin agrees

1695.2 --> 1700.32
with that

1697.279 --> 1702.96
it's just church exoterics it's

1700.32 --> 1711.84
basically creating a mystery

1702.96 --> 1711.8400000000001
on top of what it all really is

1718.0 --> 1725.84
together really so it's there is no no

1722.08 --> 1725.84
no i disagree

1726.48 --> 1730.32
and even if it were true is it relevant

1729.039 --> 1739.84
to anything

1730.32 --> 1739.84
anything at all

1742.07 --> 1745.119
[Music]

1776.48 --> 1783.44
right and it is very inviting though to

1780.0 --> 1784.48
think about the three and then figure

1783.44 --> 1787.3600000000001
out how does that

1784.48 --> 1788.72
relate to the realm for example or the

1787.36 --> 1791.9189999999999
energies

1788.72 --> 1795.84
but yeah it's it's esoteric play i i

1791.919 --> 1795.8400000000001
i step away from it

1798.159 --> 1802.3990000000001
yeah see because now george sanford is

1800.24 --> 1804.32
doing that

1802.399 --> 1805.84
and that's what happens that's what

1804.32 --> 1809.76
happens when you start to

1805.84 --> 1812.48
play esoterically with these things

1809.76 --> 1823.84
instead of just addressing each as to

1812.48 --> 1823.84
what it really is

1826.16 --> 1829.239
[Music]

1834.64 --> 1839.3600000000001
yeah i know you just followed the bible

1836.88 --> 1844.88
but you're saying something

1839.36 --> 1848.0
and you don't know how to apply it

1844.88 --> 1851.8400000000001
to anything like wonder

1848.0 --> 1851.84
what is the application of this

1853.76 --> 1857.44
it's just a separated little icon like a

1856.96 --> 1860.159
thing

1857.44 --> 1860.64
a virtual thing you can look at the

1860.159 --> 1862.88
three

1860.64 --> 1865.2
it's three and the three or ones like

1862.88 --> 1870.0800000000002
what

1865.2 --> 1870.0800000000002
so what does it matter to anything

1870.559 --> 1875.44
if anything it's only going to distract

1873.12 --> 1878.399
away from your individual attention to

1875.44 --> 1881.8400000000001
the three

1878.399 --> 1881.84
separately so

1882.32 --> 1893.84
i don't see the function other than just

1885.36 --> 1893.84
exoteric distraction

1895.279 --> 1899.84
yeah well sure it is good servant and to

1898.08 --> 1902.8799999999999
others

1899.84 --> 1904.6399999999999
god is jesus and to some they don't

1902.88 --> 1905.679
really care that just go with the holy

1904.64 --> 1908.159
spirit and

1905.679 --> 1910.159
this picks that and that picks that and

1908.159 --> 1912.3990000000001
he does that and she does that

1910.159 --> 1912.3990000000001
it's

1919.76 --> 1923.12
i just try to follow the path and figure

1922.64 --> 1926.24
out

1923.12 --> 1926.2399999999998
how logos works

1930.0 --> 1934.24
like what what would be the best course

1933.36 --> 1949.84
of action

1934.24 --> 1949.84
based on the designs of creation

1952.159 --> 1963.8400000000001
i don't know evan what about him

1965.12 --> 1969.279
i'm i'm sorry i i have to

1969.519 --> 1975.84
i have to universalize

1972.64 --> 1976.24
my path conception with christ i must

1975.84 --> 1980.72
now

1976.24 --> 1980.72
explain the other religions do i

1982.32 --> 1984.72
why

1986.32 --> 1990.559
you know it does it matter look you can

1989.44 --> 1994.0800000000002
take any of these

1990.559 --> 1996.799
religions and just look at it

1994.08 --> 1998.8799999999999
what are they doing what are they

1996.799 --> 2001.9189999999999
working on

1998.88 --> 2002.64
what are their virtues that they uphold

2001.919 --> 2005.039
actively

2002.64 --> 2006.7990000000002
and see as virtues what are their

2005.039 --> 2009.6
pitfalls

2006.799 --> 2010.0
how much logos is where and then what

2009.6 --> 2013.279
does

2010.0 --> 2016.0
each individual stick to the most within

2013.279 --> 2018.799
that religion

2016.0 --> 2021.6
right because yeah the same happens with

2018.799 --> 2023.12
christianity you might have taken notice

2021.6 --> 2025.4399999999998
there's a lot of good spots in

2023.12 --> 2026.799
christianity in on which you can focus

2025.44 --> 2028.64
as a christian

2026.799 --> 2031.039
and then yeah there are some shitty

2028.64 --> 2031.039
parts

2031.12 --> 2035.279
that hey if you're good yeah of course

2034.159 --> 2037.7600000000002
you don't do that

2035.279 --> 2038.96
right well there's just people that say

2037.76 --> 2041.2
no we disagree

2038.96 --> 2042.72
we disagree with your conception of good

2041.2 --> 2043.279
and what we're supposed to be doing with

2042.72 --> 2045.1200000000001
this

2043.279 --> 2048.639
we're gonna take that other part of the

2045.12 --> 2051.359
bible you're gonna do that

2048.639 --> 2051.359
yeah so

2054.079 --> 2057.76
it's that's why i'm an esoteric

2056.72 --> 2061.7599999999998
christian

2057.76 --> 2064.8790000000004
i basically use christ as an example of

2061.76 --> 2068.32
the ideal logos path

2064.879 --> 2070.159
which is a concept based on frequencies

2068.32 --> 2073.679
and

2070.159 --> 2077.04
principles and

2073.679 --> 2080.32
dedication discipline and awareness so

2077.04 --> 2082.96
important is the awareness it's critical

2080.32 --> 2084.2400000000002
without ascension you can't do it you

2082.96 --> 2087.04
have to grow you

2084.24 --> 2088.4799999999996
have to do that or you won't be able to

2087.04 --> 2093.2799999999997
follow the path

2088.48 --> 2093.28
effectively you'll get stuck

2094.389 --> 2098.56
[Music]

2096.079 --> 2099.8390000000004
still god different what's exoteric it's

2098.56 --> 2102.4
all esoteric

2099.839 --> 2102.96
you know the other things allah and

2102.4 --> 2105.119
buddha

2102.96 --> 2106.16
and shinto and taoism all everything you

2105.119 --> 2109.04
mentioned

2106.16 --> 2109.92
yeah it it depends it depends on which

2109.04 --> 2112.56
frequency

2109.92 --> 2113.28
you grip within it just like with the

2112.56 --> 2115.2
bible

2113.28 --> 2116.32
you can do some really weird things with

2115.2 --> 2117.839
it

2116.32 --> 2120.0
and just look at it what types of

2117.839 --> 2123.04
christianity are out there so

2120.0 --> 2127.599
somewhere out there that it just

2123.04 --> 2127.599
wrong just wrong

2128.16 --> 2134.0789999999997
so so counter-opposite to the path

2131.44 --> 2137.119
so unbelievably counter-opposite it's

2134.079 --> 2140.88
still based on the same book though

2137.119 --> 2142.96
right so it all depends

2140.88 --> 2144.0
what is your frequency what's your angle

2142.96 --> 2147.2
of approach what's your

2144.0 --> 2151.2
focus within the religion

2147.2 --> 2153.359
and then you can determine whether yeah

2151.2 --> 2154.7999999999997
what god are they really following what

2153.359 --> 2155.68
frequency are they following what

2154.8 --> 2157.2000000000003
principles are

2155.68 --> 2160.24
they following what is go they're going

2157.2 --> 2173.839
to be their end destination

2160.24 --> 2173.839
because of this

2183.359 --> 2189.04
i'm addressing uh

2186.8 --> 2190.0
the people outside the chat that think

2189.04 --> 2192.0
that

2190.0 --> 2193.04
if you're a christian that means that

2192.0 --> 2195.92
you are

2193.04 --> 2196.72
automatically declare war on all

2195.92 --> 2199.6800000000003
religions

2196.72 --> 2201.359
because that is what typical christ

2199.68 --> 2204.48
allergy people do

2201.359 --> 2207.839
they fixate on the bad parts

2204.48 --> 2210.96
because every religion has bad

2207.839 --> 2214.0
parts think yeah bad things that people

2210.96 --> 2216.4
latch onto or take out a context

2214.0 --> 2217.76
and then latch onto that wrong context

2216.4 --> 2218.4
because that's what people do and they

2217.76 --> 2222.0
do it with

2218.4 --> 2225.119
everything every freaking religion

2222.0 --> 2229.76
every freaking religion ever created

2225.119 --> 2233.359
ever all of them every idea every

2229.76 --> 2236.2400000000002
discipline spiritual discipline every

2233.359 --> 2236.24
philosophy

2236.48 --> 2240.4
people take it out of context do

2238.4 --> 2243.119
something wrong with it and that's what

2240.4 --> 2244.32
atheists and christ allergy people like

2243.119 --> 2247.599
to latch onto

2244.32 --> 2250.8
a lot overlooking that

2247.599 --> 2254.079
atheism is religion too

2250.8 --> 2254.88
and guess what there's a lot of wrong

2254.079 --> 2258.079
things

2254.88 --> 2261.04
people latch on to within atheism

2258.079 --> 2262.0
because it's full of it oh maybe your

2261.04 --> 2265.839
religion is

2262.0 --> 2269.52
kind of bad you know maybe you should

2265.839 --> 2271.359
point at your own convictions

2269.52 --> 2274.72
before you start pointing at oh

2271.359 --> 2274.72
everything that's wrong with

2282.839 --> 2285.839
christianity

2286.56 --> 2290.32
how do you get to heaven

2291.92 --> 2298.64
how do you get to heaven well let me ex

2295.04 --> 2301.2799999999997
let me answer that esoterically

2298.64 --> 2303.359
by aligning the frequency of your

2301.28 --> 2306.7200000000003
consciousness and your spirit

2303.359 --> 2310.839
to the heavenly frequencies and dropping

2306.72 --> 2312.9599999999996
all the earthly and hellish

2310.839 --> 2314.48
frequencies that they're not part of

2312.96 --> 2316.7200000000003
your spirit that you don't have any

2314.48 --> 2318.72
convictions tied into that

2316.72 --> 2321.1189999999997
that you drop those frequency and when

2318.72 --> 2322.0
your spirit is frequency is attuned

2321.119 --> 2325.04
enough

2322.0 --> 2330.72
then let's just assume

2325.04 --> 2330.72
you will migrate your spirit to heaven

2330.96 --> 2335.839
that's my answer and then it certainly

2333.92 --> 2336.4
doesn't really matter anymore now does

2335.839 --> 2340.0789999999997
it

2336.4 --> 2342.48
what religion you follow

2340.079 --> 2344.6400000000003
i i can conceive that by that that

2342.48 --> 2348.079
mechanism

2344.64 --> 2350.16
even an atheist even yeah

2348.079 --> 2352.32
although they wouldn't have to they

2350.16 --> 2354.3999999999996
still would be confronted with just the

2352.32 --> 2355.92
natural consequences of the design and

2354.4 --> 2361.599
all that

2355.92 --> 2363.119
you know added atheism is just foolish

2361.599 --> 2364.7200000000003
but i could imagine that if you don't

2363.119 --> 2368.32
focus on that and just

2364.72 --> 2370.8799999999997
focus on doing the right thing

2368.32 --> 2372.7200000000003
yeah figuring out what really works

2370.88 --> 2375.04
where we shouldn't really go

2372.72 --> 2375.7599999999998
not necessarily based on the bible or

2375.04 --> 2377.7599999999998
books

2375.76 --> 2379.0400000000004
but just on you on their natural

2377.76 --> 2382.1600000000003
sensibilities

2379.04 --> 2387.359
that even atheists could potentially

2382.16 --> 2387.359
migrate to the heavenly frequencies

2387.68 --> 2390.7999999999997
but it all depends will they be able to

2390.24 --> 2395.359
let go

2390.8 --> 2398.48
the the frequencies of earth

2395.359 --> 2400.0
and hell in order to manage that

2398.48 --> 2401.68
because that's typically an atheist

2400.0 --> 2403.839
problem is the

2401.68 --> 2405.2799999999997
the normalization that they're oh yeah

2403.839 --> 2408.56
and the

2405.28 --> 2411.0400000000004
the amoralization

2408.56 --> 2412.96
that says no it's all just natural and

2411.04 --> 2414.4
then you don't focus on getting it out

2412.96 --> 2419.359
of the way

2414.4 --> 2422.2400000000002
so yeah it all depends every single time

2419.359 --> 2422.24
that's what i think

2423.599 --> 2426.8
because to reason now that there is a

2425.52 --> 2429.92
specific

2426.8 --> 2433.28
exoteric knowledge or

2429.92 --> 2434.56
set of words or a name that you would

2433.28 --> 2437.44
have to

2434.56 --> 2438.4
think about and believe in a consecutive

2437.44 --> 2441.599
order that is

2438.4 --> 2443.76
lined out in order to be able to go

2441.599 --> 2445.28
to the end destination that everybody

2443.76 --> 2453.119
wants to

2445.28 --> 2455.0400000000004
that sounds like a scam to me

2453.119 --> 2456.4
and now there's a lot of people getting

2455.04 --> 2457.68
very triggered but you might have

2456.4 --> 2461.2000000000003
noticed

2457.68 --> 2463.9199999999996
that i left out key factors

2461.2 --> 2465.359
so yeah this concept you can apply to a

2463.92 --> 2468.8
lot of things

2465.359 --> 2471.2799999999997
huh huh

2468.8 --> 2474.1600000000003
and that's why i'm an esoterist and not

2471.28 --> 2474.1600000000003
an exeterist

2474.88 --> 2479.6800000000003
because i find the idea that there is a

2477.44 --> 2484.16
specific mantra you must

2479.68 --> 2487.04
think specifically with those words

2484.16 --> 2487.92
in order to be able to get the key to

2487.04 --> 2491.04
get

2487.92 --> 2491.839
where we all really want to go that

2491.04 --> 2495.839
sounds

2491.839 --> 2495.839
like a scam to me

2499.44 --> 2503.359
i think that is specifically what the

2502.0 --> 2506.64
priests

2503.359 --> 2507.44
in contrast to what jesus said we should

2506.64 --> 2511.2
all be doing

2507.44 --> 2514.48
did to become the middle man

2511.2 --> 2518.72
for god the gatekeeper

2514.48 --> 2522.16
for heaven literally with that right

2518.72 --> 2522.48
do you understand or do i need to get

2522.16 --> 2524.8799999999997
all

2522.48 --> 2527.359
atheists shitty on you and just remember

2524.88 --> 2529.359
what about all the babies

2527.359 --> 2531.52
that never got baptized are they all

2529.359 --> 2534.88
going to hell

2531.52 --> 2538.079
yeah it's i hate that question but yeah

2534.88 --> 2539.599
when you get into exoterics becomes a

2538.079 --> 2543.6800000000003
thing

2539.599 --> 2547.2000000000003
so it does that make sense

2543.68 --> 2550.0
there needs to be a spell literally a

2547.2 --> 2553.04
spell specific set of word specific idea

2550.0 --> 2554.0
specific names in a consecutive order

2553.04 --> 2556.079
laid out

2554.0 --> 2557.92
and if that isn't said if that isn't

2556.079 --> 2561.28
accepted

2557.92 --> 2562.079
then you go to hell or you you don't go

2561.28 --> 2565.28
to heaven

2562.079 --> 2568.8
that seems like

2565.28 --> 2579.8390000000004
a god gatekeeper middle

2568.8 --> 2579.8390000000004
man priest scam to me

2585.28 --> 2589.44
i'll just go by the natural consequences

2587.76 --> 2592.079
of the design of the realm and the

2589.44 --> 2607.34
spirit's reflection and path

2592.079 --> 2611.329
and all that i'll just go with that

2607.34 --> 2611.329
[Music]

2632.839 --> 2635.839
okay

2647.76 --> 2652.1600000000003
right that's right mn but just think

2651.28 --> 2655.2000000000003
about this

2652.16 --> 2657.52
think about this carefully do they

2655.2 --> 2658.64
even realize what they're saying when

2657.52 --> 2662.0
they say that

2658.64 --> 2664.64
because they might be correct in an

2662.0 --> 2667.44
esoteric fashion

2664.64 --> 2670.24
if you realize what christ stands for

2667.44 --> 2673.52
frequency wise the path

2670.24 --> 2673.52
then as an example

2674.96 --> 2682.56
that yeah only following the ideal

2678.88 --> 2683.04
blue the ideal blueprint for how to do

2682.56 --> 2685.7599999999998
things

2683.04 --> 2686.8
would get you there that is the

2685.76 --> 2689.0400000000004
conviction

2686.8 --> 2690.76
i can actually kind of go with that but

2689.04 --> 2693.359
if you approach it

2690.76 --> 2695.76
exactly and probably people have done

2693.359 --> 2699.119
that by accident because it's like the

2695.76 --> 2700.96
the step down of consciousness

2699.119 --> 2702.4
of conscious approach it's to make

2700.96 --> 2704.96
things literal physical

2702.4 --> 2706.64
tangible physicality assumption bias

2704.96 --> 2707.599
could actually blame for this that

2706.64 --> 2711.5989999999997
mechanism

2707.599 --> 2714.8
the simple mind that it's only that

2711.599 --> 2719.04
individual specifically that

2714.8 --> 2733.8390000000004
and that name that it means that

2719.04 --> 2733.839
see see how this works

2743.52 --> 2747.7599999999998
i know and that's their own dwelling so

2746.24 --> 2751.52
they kind of like

2747.76 --> 2753.28
without realizing it at least going in

2751.52 --> 2756.56
the right direction but their

2753.28 --> 2761.8390000000004
angle of approach is esoteric so

2756.56 --> 2761.839
yeah that's very hard to get out of it

2762.48 --> 2766.0
exit terrorism to me is like a spiritual

2764.72 --> 2770.0789999999997
spider web

2766.0 --> 2770.079
you get stuck in it you stay stuck

2772.16 --> 2779.1189999999997
and if you're lucky there's not some

2775.52 --> 2779.599
control or spider from yeah from on that

2779.119 --> 2783.04
web

2779.599 --> 2789.839
hiding in there that's gonna feed on you

2783.04 --> 2789.839
you know that's what it's like to be

2813.92 --> 2817.04
what does that mean craig the shivers do

2816.48 --> 2819.04
you think

2817.04 --> 2831.839
everything is connected on the earth

2819.04 --> 2831.839
what what does that mean

2837.64 --> 2845.839
incline the inclinometer

2846.0 --> 2848.8
never heard of that

2856.4 --> 2859.92
right good servant yeah well i thought

2858.319 --> 2863.599
i've said it myself

2859.92 --> 2866.4
the earth is flat or if it is not

2863.599 --> 2867.76
perfectly geometrical flat it's flat

2866.4 --> 2871.119
enough

2867.76 --> 2873.0400000000004
it's flat enough that it will be as good

2871.119 --> 2876.319
as perfectly flat to us because

2873.04 --> 2878.72
simply our line of sight

2876.319 --> 2879.68
will be at no point within the realms

2878.72 --> 2883.359
confine

2879.68 --> 2886.3999999999996
be able to actually see the curve

2883.359 --> 2888.16
if there is any any slight curve in any

2886.4 --> 2893.04
direction whether it is

2888.16 --> 2896.8799999999997
concave or the other way around

2893.04 --> 2900.0
is it the you know what i mean

2896.88 --> 2903.04
so it's it's as good as flat it's

2900.0 --> 2907.52
and it definitely absolutely

2903.04 --> 2910.96
excludes the specific geometrical globe

2907.52 --> 2914.14
that is assumed assumed presupposed

2910.96 --> 2917.17
by the heliocentric model

2914.14 --> 2917.17
[Music]

2928.4 --> 2932.4
how do atheists determine what's

2930.0 --> 2935.92
objectively right and wrong they don't

2932.4 --> 2935.92
they just go by their feeling

2936.24 --> 2938.7999999999997
usually

2939.599 --> 2942.6400000000003
or they don't even think about it it

2941.76 --> 2946.1600000000003
depends on

2942.64 --> 2948.64
if they are amoral

2946.16 --> 2948.64
some are

2949.62 --> 2954.0
[Music]

2952.0 --> 2955.839
but not all atheists are like that

2954.0 --> 2958.079
there's many atheists that are kind of

2955.839 --> 2961.68
like with god they're just

2958.079 --> 2964.88
they just can't accept

2961.68 --> 2965.44
a specific outline esoteric outline for

2964.88 --> 2968.319
god

2965.44 --> 2968.319
as for example

2969.44 --> 2973.44
outlined by the bible or some other book

2971.599 --> 2974.0
and they can't accept the specifics

2973.44 --> 2976.4
about it

2974.0 --> 2978.24
and then they reject it so there's a lot

2976.4 --> 2981.44
of atheists i used to be one of them

2978.24 --> 2985.839
that simply rejected religion

2981.44 --> 2985.839
because i thought it was wrong

2986.0 --> 2990.079
and that would sort of classify me under

2988.319 --> 2993.2
atheist but

2990.079 --> 2996.6400000000003
technically i was always

2993.2 --> 2999.839
an esoteric theist

2996.64 --> 3002.4
i always felt knew

2999.839 --> 3003.52
there was this connecting factor to all

3002.4 --> 3006.559
things

3003.52 --> 3011.04
spiritual connecting factor that

3006.559 --> 3014.7200000000003
was had a will of its own that you can't

3011.04 --> 3018.64
overcome as it were i always felt that

3014.72 --> 3027.839
and i assumed that that was probably the

3018.64 --> 3027.839
god everybody's talking about

3034.48 --> 3037.76
anyway it seems the conversation has

3036.88 --> 3041.2000000000003
moved on to

3037.76 --> 3045.6800000000003
flat earth situations

3041.2 --> 3045.68
uh it was good to address this

3048.079 --> 3055.8390000000004
i got five more minutes anyway and then

3049.76 --> 3055.8390000000004
i'm rounding out the show

3062.319 --> 3067.359
so there is nothing wrong in way

3067.839 --> 3071.68
if the children produced all humanity

3070.24 --> 3074.24
that's correct

3071.68 --> 3074.24
that's right

3080.079 --> 3086.319
i think that's very possible

3083.2 --> 3088.319
especially if the energy circumstances

3086.319 --> 3090.72
like the ether that is feeding all life

3088.319 --> 3093.68
was very different back then

3090.72 --> 3094.48
then probably the original design

3093.68 --> 3096.319
blueprint

3094.48 --> 3098.2400000000002
the adam and eve genetics you could

3096.319 --> 3100.0
colic i call it and

3098.24 --> 3101.359
i don't know maybe there was other

3100.0 --> 3103.119
traits to it

3101.359 --> 3104.72
on the higher energy level that have

3103.119 --> 3107.04
been lost because the higher energy

3104.72 --> 3110.0789999999997
level is lost like for example telepathy

3107.04 --> 3111.92
right so maybe what humanity was

3110.079 --> 3114.88
originally in the adam and eve for

3111.92 --> 3116.319
what had the potential to become all

3114.88 --> 3119.839
this

3116.319 --> 3122.16
it's just that the

3119.839 --> 3123.7599999999998
degeneration over time which is natural

3122.16 --> 3127.359
the entropy

3123.76 --> 3130.1600000000003
even of genetics causes us to what

3127.359 --> 3132.319
we are to then think of but yeah but if

3130.16 --> 3134.16
they were just like we are right now

3132.319 --> 3136.48
how could every thing come from this

3134.16 --> 3138.72
well because it's not exactly it wasn't

3136.48 --> 3143.28
exactly like we are now

3138.72 --> 3147.2
we are basically yeah

3143.28 --> 3149.6800000000003
poor shadow designs in in comparison to

3147.2 --> 3150.16
the original adam and eve in my opinion

3149.68 --> 3153.839
in

3150.16 --> 3153.839
my view of that

3170.64 --> 3174.319
incest was rather the only

3174.72 --> 3177.87
[Music]

3179.44 --> 3185.839
i don't know i don't know if that's

3182.72 --> 3186.16
at that point even relevant when you're

3185.839 --> 3190.4
like

3186.16 --> 3193.2799999999997
primary species then incest

3190.4 --> 3194.8
it's yeah it's not gonna do anything bad

3193.28 --> 3198.88
at that point

3194.8 --> 3198.88
because everything is so strong

3202.079 --> 3206.1600000000003
it's it's just like with cloning plants

3204.319 --> 3208.079
when the plant is very

3206.16 --> 3209.7599999999998
strong very vibrant you can clone it

3208.079 --> 3211.2000000000003
many many times and then you can even

3209.76 --> 3214.0
clone from the clones and then you can

3211.2 --> 3218.0
clone from those clones but eventually

3214.0 --> 3218.0
it will start to wither

3218.24 --> 3222.9599999999996
see and i think it yeah it sort of works

3221.76 --> 3226.2400000000002
the same i guess with

3222.96 --> 3226.88
incest with yeah the the first human

3226.24 --> 3230.5589999999997
species

3226.88 --> 3234.2400000000002
yeah how how else are you gonna do it

3230.559 --> 3237.8390000000004
unless god made some other humans

3234.24 --> 3238.3999999999996
on top of that it's kind of left out i

3237.839 --> 3239.7599999999998
don't know

3238.4 --> 3242.079
i don't know how else it would have

3239.76 --> 3242.079
happened

3247.119 --> 3253.839
shows how kind of ridiculous what no

3250.559 --> 3254.1600000000003
see the atheists do this constantly they

3253.839 --> 3256.5589999999997
just

3254.16 --> 3258.0
assert this thing they say oh this makes

3256.559 --> 3261.2000000000003
it so ridiculous

3258.0 --> 3263.44
i just gave you an entire response

3261.2 --> 3264.64
how does that make the old testament so

3263.44 --> 3267.68
ridiculous

3264.64 --> 3269.839
really no you just haven't thought about

3267.68 --> 3273.359
it carefully enough

3269.839 --> 3277.44
but natural consequences design

3273.359 --> 3280.319
and then put that in between

3277.44 --> 3281.839
that information in the missing or left

3280.319 --> 3283.359
out parts

3281.839 --> 3284.72
or that is were considered

3283.359 --> 3286.0
non-consequential people wouldn't

3284.72 --> 3288.72
understand it

3286.0 --> 3290.799
or the the writers themselves that

3288.72 --> 3291.7599999999998
interpreted this from the message of god

3290.799 --> 3294.96
didn't

3291.76 --> 3298.079
know how to explain it

3294.96 --> 3301.839
and that leaves room in all of it

3298.079 --> 3305.04
and we can fill that room up

3301.839 --> 3308.16
you know we can devise in

3305.04 --> 3310.799
how was mankind

3308.16 --> 3310.799
designed

3312.319 --> 3315.68
but atheists seem to have so much

3313.92 --> 3318.2400000000002
trouble with just

3315.68 --> 3319.5989999999997
getting that getting that it is a big

3318.24 --> 3322.8799999999997
puzzle that we're still

3319.599 --> 3325.28
in the process of figuring out

3322.88 --> 3327.04
anyway i'm gonna round out the show i

3325.28 --> 3330.3190000000004
thought it was a good show today

3327.04 --> 3332.319
