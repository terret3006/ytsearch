6.72 --> 37.809
[Music]

41.04 --> 44.67
let's do that again

46.78 --> 81.14
[Music]

77.14 --> 85.1
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

81.14 --> 89.12
early-bird number 104 I'm your host

85.1 --> 92.53999999999999
Arwen and today it's a very similar day

89.12 --> 98.72
to yesterday weather like what a crazy

92.54 --> 103.43
day look so many things happening in the

98.72 --> 105.92
media front it is where do I even start

103.43 --> 108.98
I can't feel this this hour with

105.92 --> 111.71000000000001
everything that happened like even if I

108.98 --> 115.45
if I had made a list of all this I would

111.71 --> 115.44999999999999
never get through it in an hour

115.67 --> 120.13
let's just start that yesterday I

120.25 --> 129.05
eventually caught myself watching three

127.94 --> 133.46
live streams

129.05 --> 136.16000000000003
and the Alex Jones Show and playing a

133.46 --> 142.81
computer game and listening a song at

136.16 --> 142.81
the same time yeah that happened

143.819 --> 150.26899999999998
it's just because every lifestream

147.59 --> 152.519
what's too interesting I couldn't turn

150.269 --> 154.56
it off so just like okay screw it I'm

152.519 --> 156.84
just gonna have them all talking through

154.56 --> 158.7
each other like okay I'm gonna do this

156.84 --> 165.54
like the a I'm just gonna do it all at

158.7 --> 166.01899999999998
the same time and yeah that was cool was

165.54 --> 169.31
it again

166.019 --> 173.31
oh yeah lifting the veil oh and Benjamin

169.31 --> 177.48
Martin lead kiss amazing another

173.31 --> 184.29
tertiary show and Alex Jones on a night

177.48 --> 187.54899999999998
note music and playing a game without

184.29 --> 187.54899999999998
sound just

188.47 --> 194.98
to be physically busy it was weird but

192.22 --> 196.42
it worked sort of and it's like oh wow I

194.98 --> 198.54999999999998
think I hear something really

196.42 --> 201.30999999999997
interesting right here let's zoom in on

198.55 --> 203.65
this mute the rest okay cool okay

201.31 --> 205.71
unmute arrest oh wow there's something

203.65 --> 210.91
really cool here happening okay a mute

205.71 --> 216.28
that mute the rest multitasking

210.91 --> 221.17
multitasking but yeah there is so much

216.28 --> 227.34
happening right now it's it is all

221.17 --> 227.33999999999997
inspiring and terrifying

228.19 --> 234.97
and just overwhelming like I find myself

232.09 --> 238.11
again it is very much like it the

234.97 --> 240.49
experience that I have had in some

238.11 --> 244.3
relationships where I was just so

240.49 --> 249.52
overwhelmed by the glory that I would

244.3 --> 255.33
find myself just like crying in ik

249.52 --> 258.73
stasis just from the sensation of it and

255.33 --> 262.6
yeah however crazy this world has become

258.73 --> 267.58000000000004
it does definitely do that in hilarity

262.6 --> 269.89000000000004
in amazement in human ingenuity and

267.58 --> 273.60999999999996
inhuman absolute bottom-feeder

269.89 --> 278.21999999999997
retardation all at the same time it's

273.61 --> 278.22
crazy the world's gone absolutely nuts

280.599 --> 283.679
what can you do

285.08 --> 291.65
hmm right oh yeah a happy birthday

289.28 --> 297.13899999999995
Rhys only sheep who can't see apparently

291.65 --> 299.81
you just turned 34 a few hours ago

297.139 --> 302.11
so congratulations man happy birthday to

299.81 --> 302.11
you

305.919 --> 310.89
what yeah

308.73 --> 315.06
let's start out with a typical flat

310.89 --> 318.91999999999996
earth note here seems that I'm not even

315.06 --> 321.81
the first to cover it but apparently

318.92 --> 324.77000000000004
scientists have finally agreed upon that

321.81 --> 329.67
the moon is in the Earth's atmosphere

324.77 --> 335.34
that's what I've been I've been saying

329.67 --> 338.03000000000003
you know if the moon is having a gravity

335.34 --> 341.36999999999995
influence on the oceans of the earth

338.03 --> 344.76
then so must it do the same on the air

341.37 --> 349.68
of the earth so naturally if we

344.76 --> 353.15999999999997
presuppose gravity if we presuppose the

349.68 --> 354.84000000000003
outer space and all the bodies including

353.16 --> 357.18
the earth are a ball then there must be

354.84 --> 360.63
gas from this power the other ball

357.18 --> 366.36
yeah now that's an interesting new

360.63 --> 369.3
chapter to continue the presuppositional

366.36 --> 373.95
route of how it could be if everything

369.3 --> 377.36
was a ball and I love it like yeah you

373.95 --> 380.03999999999996
guys may think it's crazy it is crazy

377.36 --> 384.27000000000004
but it kind of brings a tear to my eye

380.04 --> 387.36
because I think it's beautiful I think

384.27 --> 390.51
they're actually trying to make

387.36 --> 392.82
something real out of it that could

390.51 --> 395.84999999999997
remotely be real and I'm now expecting

392.82 --> 397.8
more elements but I pretty much predict

395.85 --> 400.77000000000004
it and everybody talked over it just

397.8 --> 402.83
didn't respond to that they're gonna pop

400.77 --> 402.83
up

403.37 --> 411.01
because they have to they have no other

406.389 --> 414.169
choice because they need to fix their

411.01 --> 418.13
presuppositional mess need to close up

414.169 --> 419.169
more stitches overlay more in losing

418.13 --> 424.49
illusionary

419.169 --> 428.71
works to make it at least seem somewhat

424.49 --> 432.05
coherent and apparently they are

428.71 --> 439.63
engaging and I'm absolutely fascinated

432.05 --> 444.82
with this so first let's get back to

439.63 --> 447.82
YouTube and fix that mistake of mine

444.82 --> 447.82
stupid

447.83 --> 451.69
accidentally click the off button

453.589 --> 463.399
oh wait maybe didn't register huh

459.039 --> 466.30899999999997
okay fine we'll see afterwards if

463.399 --> 468.529
there's like a four-second or like it

466.309 --> 472.059
one and a half minute hang out I'll just

468.529 --> 475.269
delete that but at least we got this one

472.059 --> 482.17900000000003
so let's see it was in chat besides Reis

475.269 --> 486.379
AGM 101 rock hound Andrea Browning music

482.179 --> 490.11899999999997
on the Voynich salt at 667 down through

486.379 --> 490.119
the UK Napoleon okay

495.96 --> 501.98999999999995
keep your freaky gay fetishes to

499.59 --> 505.71
yourself thank you very much

501.99 --> 512.13
hello walls and Thursdays to see you

505.71 --> 514.77
guys ah it was really cool yesterday

512.13 --> 516.83
just talk about it all I'm gonna talk

514.77 --> 519.899
about it oh I'm not even gonna get to

516.83 --> 523.38
talking about things that I think about

519.899 --> 525.6
which starting to suck to me anyway just

523.38 --> 530.149
talking about what's happening out there

525.6 --> 532.44
is sufficient amusement for now I think

530.149 --> 541.23
but it was really cool

532.44 --> 545.5500000000001
oh and Benjamin he opened up his chat

541.23 --> 547.29
again so kudos to you Owen Benjamin you

545.55 --> 550.5
do that and yeah there will always be

547.29 --> 554.04
trolls but yeah there's also gonna be

550.5 --> 555.6
people like me in there and I wasn't

554.04 --> 560.18
there and I made a lot of jokes

555.6 --> 563.1
I did a me fuh of course

560.18 --> 566.55
it's this thing I'm doing now indeed

563.1 --> 571.1700000000001
Wayne D well done I should take me fast

566.55 --> 573.9
and look depending on who you're gonna

571.17 --> 574.9799999999999
encounter that's gonna ask what does me

573.9 --> 578.9399999999999
if I stand for

574.98 --> 582.779
you can either yeah you size them up you

578.94 --> 585.0290000000001
say okay this guy is probably not gonna

582.779 --> 587.64
handle flatter so well and then you just

585.029 --> 593.73
gonna tell him okay it stands for make

587.64 --> 597.779
earth free again it is right that's what

593.73 --> 603.75
we're trying to do and yeah they've got

597.779 --> 607.91
like yeah yellow fast we cool awesome

603.75 --> 607.91
and if they're a little bit more

608.0 --> 615.18
different they're like into conspiracy

612.3 --> 618.05
theories no yeah you can consider just

615.18 --> 623.04
telling them the bottom line and that is

618.05 --> 626.0699999999999
make earth flat again and they're either

623.04 --> 628.9499999999999
gonna be saying like a word that doesn't

626.07 --> 633.3290000000001
make any sense or they're really really

628.95 --> 635.94
really gonna get the joke so the joke

633.329 --> 641.76
that's not really a joke but it is a

635.94 --> 646.86
joke because reality is the joke ashtec

641.76 --> 651.06
meifa anyway I did also another more on

646.86 --> 656.3100000000001
Benjamin humor related joke in there and

651.06 --> 661.6199999999999
said hashtag mmm-ma and that stands for

656.31 --> 663.4799999999999
make men mustache again thank you God it

661.62 --> 667.55
didn't really address it because he was

663.48 --> 671.16
having an awesome conversation with a

667.55 --> 671.7299999999999
comedic writer they also talked about

671.16 --> 674.85
Flat Earth

671.73 --> 678.4200000000001
it was stellar I definitely recommend

674.85 --> 680.37
you go out and watch that that video and

678.42 --> 681.99
also watch out for my comments there

680.37 --> 685.199
were some fellow flat-earthers that

681.99 --> 689.779
recognized me in chat you know what I'm

685.199 --> 689.779
gonna link to it I'm just gonna link to

690.67 --> 699.92
it was all so take a look at that

696.8 --> 703.9599999999999
afterward or like tonight when all the

699.92 --> 703.9599999999999
other live streams are finally done I

706.0 --> 715.55
try to do it before his next stream you

709.55 --> 719.9499999999999
know because these days trying to stay

715.55 --> 719.9499999999999
informed what is going on

723.33 --> 730.38
it's a full-time job and beyond it it

727.44 --> 732.839
will take 16 hours a day out of your

730.38 --> 735.6
life just to keep track of what the

732.839 --> 740.399
Freak is going on and that's only with

735.6 --> 743.3100000000001
the people that I've got mmm like

740.399 --> 745.709
attached to like okay these aren't super

743.31 --> 748.3199999999999
awesome I want to follow them I can't

745.709 --> 750.9899999999999
not follow them because there is so much

748.32 --> 751.98
out there it's like yeah if you really

750.99 --> 756.26
want to keep track

751.98 --> 760.91
you're gonna somehow need 96 hours a day

756.26 --> 765.14
it's a good luck with that unless you

760.91 --> 768.7199999999999
like hype yourself up with some super

765.14 --> 771.36
turbo force methamphetamine and all that

768.72 --> 773.9100000000001
[ __ ] of brain force and everything so

771.36 --> 775.64
your time just goes like five times as

773.91 --> 777.99
quick and then you speed played oh

775.64 --> 779.67
that's like the only way you can keep

777.99 --> 783.029
track of everything now these days

779.67 --> 785.16
because it's nuts there's so much so

783.029 --> 787.23
much people that are doing really

785.16 --> 793.29
awesome things having really inspiring

787.23 --> 797.0
thoughts and any information feedback on

793.29 --> 797.0
what is going on out there yeah

799.15 --> 810.149
build there

801.6 --> 810.75
phocion that's yeah that's a real troll

810.149 --> 813.3
joke

810.75 --> 819.209
it's almost funny but it's not really

813.3 --> 821.3389999999999
funny right I did talk about that Anders

819.209 --> 825.079
ace yeah

821.339 --> 833.49
they finally recognized the gradient of

825.079 --> 835.29
the atmosphere how the Hoff pressure

833.49 --> 839.279
let's just is not a half life but the

835.29 --> 842.3
half pressuring goes up exponentially as

839.279 --> 845.97
the distance to the earth surface

842.3 --> 849.3
becomes greater and yeah you will

845.97 --> 850.23
technically end up with the moon in that

849.3 --> 853.29
atmosphere

850.23 --> 856.259
if you presuppose the moon is at the

853.29 --> 859.199
distance that it is pretty supposed to

856.259 --> 861.029
be yeah that's the consequences if

859.199 --> 862.459
you're having presuppositions there

861.029 --> 864.899
gonna be consequences

862.459 --> 868.439
technical consequences and this is one

864.899 --> 870.509
of them and I think it's I think it's

868.439 --> 874.61
cool they're going there it's very risky

870.509 --> 878.22
but man it is ringing loose this

874.61 --> 881.75
thinking storm even from the baller side

878.22 --> 881.75
it is fascinating to see

882.84 --> 890.34
let's see where this goes and yeah how

886.77 --> 892.86
long until they recognize that gravity

890.34 --> 894.9
may have fluctuations over distance as

892.86 --> 898.02
well as it can be the only thing that

894.9 --> 902.79
can actually contain the gas pressure by

898.02 --> 910.9499999999999
having a extremely strong gravity at

902.79 --> 914.68
some level to counteract the force gas

910.95 --> 916.99
escaping from the atmosphere

914.68 --> 920.53
probably simulate this and then figure

916.99 --> 923.53
out yeah it's the only way and I called

920.53 --> 931.77
it at least a year ago maybe even two

923.53 --> 935.47
now remember the atmosphere extension

931.77 --> 938.89
well yeah the exosphere extension looked

935.47 --> 941.14
at yeah of course

938.89 --> 944.17
sleeping warrior disagrees with me

941.14 --> 947.64
because that's what he always does when

944.17 --> 950.8499999999999
I bring up something new you know I

947.64 --> 950.85
don't care

953.779 --> 955.959
yeah

963.529 --> 966.529
but

967.029 --> 974.98
yeah that happened what else happened

971.399 --> 978.72
God apparently fight the Flat Earth just

974.98 --> 978.72
went in full

980.73 --> 987.78
full shameless evil idiots it's like I

984.83 --> 991.08
really feel I said it in Chad it seems

987.78 --> 994.92
like they're having a competition as to

991.08 --> 1006.2
who can be the most let me just quote

994.92 --> 1008.9399999999999
myself who can be the most [ __ ] wait

1006.2 --> 1011.36
no that's not the cord

1008.94 --> 1011.36
where is it

1012.58 --> 1015.39
myself

1024.64 --> 1027.5400000000002
where is it

1028.75 --> 1034.199
I thought I wrote it down somewhere damn

1032.019 --> 1034.199
it

1038.63 --> 1045.22
oh wait I wrote it down in a comment on

1041.0 --> 1045.22
that video find it

1048.77 --> 1054.47
yeah the video Karen posted Karen

1051.29 --> 1056.809
brought this baller atrocity to my

1054.47 --> 1059.809
attention so here's my comment to that

1056.809 --> 1062.66
video seems the ballers are having a

1059.809 --> 1065.51
competition amongst themselves who of

1062.66 --> 1069.74
them is the most [ __ ] most shameless

1065.51 --> 1073.76
and most transparent scumbag of all time

1069.74 --> 1077.3
and they're really trying it's become a

1073.76 --> 1079.52
competition maybe they've recognized all

1077.3 --> 1082.12
of them that that is exactly what they

1079.52 --> 1087.32
are and they're really trying to get the

1082.12 --> 1090.58
the grand prize of atrocity because yeah

1087.32 --> 1094.3999999999999
pretending like you're a war veteran and

1090.58 --> 1097.6
then actually begging the wider audience

1094.4 --> 1097.6000000000001
for money with that in

1101.94 --> 1104.63
yeah

1105.12 --> 1109.799
I'm not too sure but I think that under

1108.059 --> 1111.98
certain circumstances people can

1109.799 --> 1115.019
actually go to jail for that

1111.98 --> 1119.48
not sure though but it is quite

1115.019 --> 1121.769
atrocious so yeah fight the flat earth

1119.48 --> 1125.1200000000001
probably gonna be fighting a little bit

1121.769 --> 1128.45
more than flat earth to keep this up

1125.12 --> 1128.4499999999998
good luck with that

1142.08 --> 1150.83

don't know what is causing you to go do

1165.72 --> 1169.28

1257.7 --> 1260.51
one I love you guys

1289.63 --> 1294.6200000000001
so yeah

1291.59 --> 1299.29
I got some good medical update news for

1294.62 --> 1304.2399999999998
myself as in who are wins conditions

1299.29 --> 1311.8999999999999
yeah I've been trying for a while

1304.24 --> 1314.42
about two days goodie I also had a kind

1311.9 --> 1319.1200000000001
of is smoking break for two days and

1314.42 --> 1319.1200000000001
then yesterday

1320.22 --> 1326.49
let's say a month ago more I was smoking

1323.82 --> 1328.56
a lot too much for my own doing too much

1326.49 --> 1335.76
financially it sucks and I'm kind of

1328.56 --> 1338.94
ashamed for it and I really am it's how

1335.76 --> 1342.12
it goes those keeps increasing so it's

1338.94 --> 1347.16
just not gonna do anything and make you

1342.12 --> 1350.4899999999998
want more right I dyed it dialed it down

1347.16 --> 1353.1000000000001
and just got the absolute minimum you

1350.49 --> 1355.98
can get and I get it now really in the

1353.1 --> 1359.1
evening late when the store is almost

1355.98 --> 1361.41
closing and I didn't yeah not smoking in

1359.1 --> 1366.9599999999998
the morning anymore I've been doing that

1361.41 --> 1369.72
for for almost half a year I'd even like

1366.96 --> 1372.27
smoke a joint before I take breakfast

1369.72 --> 1373.29
sounds really creepy or something but

1372.27 --> 1376.95
yeah it's doable

1373.29 --> 1379.22
and then I got like only how the the

1376.95 --> 1379.22
heart

1380.75 --> 1385.52
it's not the right word I think

1382.9 --> 1386.3200000000002
palpitations we're just heart starts

1385.52 --> 1389.809
racing

1386.32 --> 1393.789
very nervously and that scared the [ __ ]

1389.809 --> 1398.2
out of me so I quit then try it again

1393.789 --> 1399.62
yesterday and it wasn't there at all

1398.2 --> 1403.419
nothing

1399.62 --> 1403.4189999999999
it's perfectly calm

1403.49 --> 1414.95
I honestly didn't expect that to ever go

1407.39 --> 1416.8700000000001
away ever again but it did that doesn't

1414.95 --> 1423.68
mean that I'm now gonna oh my god let's

1416.87 --> 1425.4699999999998
get it back and that's a triple cannabis

1423.68 --> 1429.53
input nope

1425.47 --> 1432.8
I'm trying not to do that but I'm very

1429.53 --> 1435.11
glad to report that the side the very

1432.8 --> 1441.53
annoying negative and nerfing side

1435.11 --> 1448.1799999999998
effects seem to have gone why I have no

1441.53 --> 1448.18
idea I have no idea I just have no idea

1450.299 --> 1454.759
what I do have however is fish oil

1455.03 --> 1457.87
but a new

1459.9 --> 1464.94
a bottle of that and I think that's

1463.049 --> 1468.0
probably gonna help a lot it's always

1464.94 --> 1472.44
good for the heart everything and for

1468.0 --> 1473.789
the brain everything then I had not been

1472.44 --> 1478.95
taking it for a while because I

1473.789 --> 1481.64
basically ran out so maybe that's also

1478.95 --> 1481.64
related

1482.7 --> 1490.8890000000001
yeah but finances are still an issue so

1485.7 --> 1494.3890000000001
you can't just do anything because it's

1490.889 --> 1499.4599999999998
right because you can't pay for it so I

1494.389 --> 1499.4599999999998
got that also

1500.74 --> 1511.3700000000001
hope to get a credit card system soon

1507.43 --> 1513.17
but it's kind of confusing because yeah

1511.37 --> 1515.4199999999998
I'm not a guy that's gonna actually go

1513.17 --> 1519.0500000000002
to a credit card company and say oh yeah

1515.42 --> 1521.809
I'm gonna pay you money so yeah I can

1519.05 --> 1524.05
make debt and then pay that back plus

1521.809 --> 1528.6499999999999
interest no screw that

1524.05 --> 1531.5
that's pure theft it's pure theft I hate

1528.65 --> 1534.47
it disgusting it's overrated it's so for

1531.5 --> 1540.47
charge it's terrible it's evil it's

1534.47 --> 1545.47
banker exploitation I hate that but tied

1540.47 --> 1550.19
in with the financial plan GTI company

1545.47 --> 1555.53
they've been getting some big Bank

1550.19 --> 1559.91
players involved that may actually yeah

1555.53 --> 1562.79
have a credit card option so I won't be

1559.91 --> 1566.78
making that with it I just always have a

1562.79 --> 1569.09
surplus and then I finally can use like

1566.78 --> 1570.58
a credit card and that does open a lot

1569.09 --> 1575.3
of doors because yeah

1570.58 --> 1577.8799999999999
for example maybe good bad example in

1575.3 --> 1581.1399999999999
Paris at this point the info our store

1577.88 --> 1587.19
it doesn't take holy [ __ ]

1581.14 --> 1596.019
damn ISA holy [ __ ]

1587.19 --> 1600.749
thank you you just damn 50 bucks I can

1596.019 --> 1608.949
smoke more than one with that but yeah

1600.749 --> 1610.749
thanks you guys yeah good distraction

1608.949 --> 1612.3690000000001
still gonna talk about the enforced or

1610.749 --> 1614.229
though yeah they don't take paypal

1612.369 --> 1616.749
anymore PayPal cut them off some time

1614.229 --> 1619.659
ago and I used PayPal because it's very

1616.749 --> 1621.969
efficient very easy it's like a switch

1619.659 --> 1623.709
you can put on your bank very easy to do

1621.969 --> 1628.269
internet stuff its but yeah they cut

1623.709 --> 1631.179
them off because yeah because there are

1628.269 --> 1634.109
liberal Wheaties and they yeah they cut

1631.179 --> 1636.3090000000002
them off cause they're dicks really

1634.109 --> 1638.559
although it's a good system but they're

1636.309 --> 1639.969
still dicks it's so conflicting you know

1638.559 --> 1642.389
when something is good but their dicks

1639.969 --> 1642.3890000000001
it's like

1647.12 --> 1651.9499999999998
at least yeah they're giving an

1648.98 --> 1654.17
opportunity for people to donate to my

1651.95 --> 1656.96
paypal and I do appreciate them for that

1654.17 --> 1659.5700000000002
and I wish that these groups would just

1656.96 --> 1662.89
stop politicizing everything it is so

1659.57 --> 1665.57
annoying stop doing it you're just

1662.89 --> 1668.0300000000002
you're just wounding yourself with your

1665.57 --> 1670.76
idiocy stop doing it if you just don't

1668.03 --> 1672.5
talk about it nobody will care only a

1670.76 --> 1674.51
bunch of screaming self-destructive

1672.5 --> 1677.12
social justice worry idiots will care

1674.51 --> 1679.1
and nobody cares about what they care

1677.12 --> 1683.9799999999998
about so stop caring about what they

1679.1 --> 1689.6899999999998
care about and just do what is sensible

1683.98 --> 1692.63
so but yeah they did it and thus there

1689.69 --> 1694.28
was no more way for me to order anything

1692.63 --> 1698.0
and I haven't ordered anything at least

1694.28 --> 1702.22
half a year but yeah if I get this

1698.0 --> 1705.2
credit card back then suddenly I will

1702.22 --> 1708.92
potentially have access again to that

1705.2 --> 1711.29
and to other stores and all their paying

1708.92 --> 1714.2
options because there's a lot of things

1711.29 --> 1716.6
out there that don't use standard bank

1714.2 --> 1718.43
transfer systems in their payment system

1716.6 --> 1722.09
they use credit cards because it is the

1718.43 --> 1724.78
most widespread option that is the best

1722.09 --> 1724.78
supported

1728.75 --> 1735.16
if I'm correct

1731.3 --> 1737.75
you actually can only even pay for the

1735.16 --> 1741.17
platters conference in Amsterdam with a

1737.75 --> 1744.14
credit card I bumped into that so I need

1741.17 --> 1746.5700000000002
it and I will get it and I will get it

1744.14 --> 1750.4
without debt that's gonna be awesome

1746.57 --> 1750.3999999999999
it's got to give me some freedom

1753.22 --> 1757.3600000000001
and they will go to the Flat Earth

1754.93 --> 1762.04
conference with that and I will order

1757.36 --> 1766.1499999999999
some supplements because yeah whatever

1762.04 --> 1767.68
alex jones stands for can't deny it has

1766.15 --> 1770.38
the best freakin supplements in the

1767.68 --> 1772.8700000000001
world i stand behind that and unless he

1770.38 --> 1777.5500000000002
just suddenly throws everything around

1772.87 --> 1779.6399999999999
and noticeably starts selling junk which

1777.55 --> 1782.3799999999999
i don't think it's going to happen

1779.64 --> 1784.68
yeah i will support that i support

1782.38 --> 1784.68
quality

1794.13 --> 1803.3600000000001
for whatever mistakes he's making in

1797.24 --> 1803.36
choices and political narratives

1805.05 --> 1811.62
and then yeah yeah I'm out of weed and

1809.61 --> 1815.52
it's good I don't need it I don't need

1811.62 --> 1819.36
it right now I've been smoking yesterday

1815.52 --> 1823.53
like even during our little hangout with

1819.36 --> 1826.9199999999998
Randy Riley you chocolate and Nathan

1823.53 --> 1829.2
that response to that that that new guy

1826.92 --> 1831.98
of God another collaborated another

1829.2 --> 1834.3600000000001
competitor for absolute moronic idiocy

1831.98 --> 1837.5
that's yeah during that hangout I was

1834.36 --> 1841.9799999999998
smoking and I enjoyed it it was good I

1837.5 --> 1844.65
felt really welcome among the guys that

1841.98 --> 1847.05
was awesome but I'm not gonna do that

1844.65 --> 1851.93
disser Lee just I have done that for

1847.05 --> 1851.93
some time didn't work out

1852.55 --> 1857.6789999999999
that's costing me a lot of money anyway

1854.91 --> 1860.679
even if he's just gonna give me 50 years

1857.679 --> 1864.24
in the super chest which I can't cash

1860.679 --> 1864.24
right now by the way so

1869.01 --> 1873.72
yeah oh by the way chocolates sayin like

1871.62 --> 1875.1299999999999
if the moon is actually in the Earth's

1873.72 --> 1878.8500000000001
atmosphere that's a good sign because

1875.13 --> 1880.98
that means that we will actually be able

1878.85 --> 1885.6599999999999
to go there with rockets because there's

1880.98 --> 1892.25
an atmosphere to press upon for a rocket

1885.66 --> 1892.25
to get there members

1892.78 --> 1901.1299999999999
yeah you know in a way after everything

1899.48 --> 1904.97
that the flat-earthers have done with

1901.13 --> 1911.0
all the ball [ __ ] it's almost like nine

1904.97 --> 1913.4
NASA just must do it again just don't

1911.0 --> 1916.79
worm their way through rearrange things

1913.4 --> 1919.64
so that it is possible technically and

1916.79 --> 1921.3799999999999
it's like yeah I know it doesn't make

1919.64 --> 1925.73
any sense and the moon is not really a

1921.38 --> 1928.3400000000001
physical object but yeah it all kind of

1925.73 --> 1930.56
works presuppositional ii now and we are

1928.34 --> 1933.6499999999999
doing it and we're going there and we're

1930.56 --> 1935.54
there and look yeah and now we got

1933.65 --> 1938.5
excuses for every little cinematic

1935.54 --> 1940.49
detail about it we have some we have

1938.5 --> 1942.23
pre-prepared plans don't know how to

1940.49 --> 1946.18
respond as to what you're seeing in the

1942.23 --> 1946.18
footage and ha ha ha ha

1946.9 --> 1951.26
they're almost obligated to do that at

1949.55 --> 1953.45
this point and they're probably gonna do

1951.26 --> 1955.61
that or try it or I don't know it's

1953.45 --> 1957.47
gonna it's gonna get crazy and it's

1955.61 --> 1960.74
gonna get extremely amusing and

1957.47 --> 1963.19
interesting it's gonna grip people one

1960.74 --> 1963.19
way or the other

1964.32 --> 1972.05
and I'm kind of loving it but where what

1969.24 --> 1972.05
I was getting distracted

1978.12 --> 1985.83
yeah bill G just look they're just

1981.72 --> 1986.46
discovered is right don't think about it

1985.83 --> 1989.01
too much

1986.46 --> 1991.549
okay there still have to work out all

1989.01 --> 1997.86
the kinks and marbles and everything

1991.549 --> 2000.4089999999999
because yeah they every time NASA does a

1997.86 --> 2004.6689999999999
new realization and alteration of the

2000.409 --> 2007.5200000000002
total set up of their cosmogony they can

2004.669 --> 2009.38
never truly oversee the consequences of

2007.52 --> 2010.1
this the physical consequences that all

2009.38 --> 2015.1100000000001
come with it

2010.1 --> 2017.059
giant tale of problems and fragmented

2015.11 --> 2019.01
things like oh [ __ ]

2017.059 --> 2020.6299999999999
but we made this statement before and

2019.01 --> 2021.98
that said when that contradicts it and

2020.63 --> 2024.919
that contradicts our [ __ ] we have to

2021.98 --> 2029.24
like redo one third of almost everything

2024.919 --> 2030.8300000000002
we said they'll find a way they'll find

2029.24 --> 2033.23
a way they'll technobabble their way

2030.83 --> 2035.96
around it or something and or all their

2033.23 --> 2038.69
maybe even going to shame some people or

2035.96 --> 2043.07
whatever they're gonna probably take

2038.69 --> 2043.8200000000002
some four guys for it that were like oh

2043.07 --> 2047.3899999999999
yeah

2043.82 --> 2050.119
yeah we were indeed doing some things on

2047.39 --> 2052.2200000000003
the presuppositional basis but these

2050.119 --> 2053.75
guys insisted there was going to be that

2052.22 --> 2055.7599999999998
way and we thought yeah but we don't

2053.75 --> 2057.919
know for sure and they insist it so we

2055.76 --> 2062.679
just went with them ooh yeah we thought

2057.919 --> 2062.679
they might have been wrong you know it's

2063.73 --> 2069.639
not that hard it's not that hard to do

2067.429 --> 2069.639
that

2071.07 --> 2077.28
because they will when put in the corner

2075.39 --> 2079.74
admit that most of it is all

2077.28 --> 2081.9
presuppositional base but with the trust

2079.74 --> 2084.1499999999996
that during progress they actually do

2081.9 --> 2084.8
confirm the presupposition that's the

2084.15 --> 2090.51
trick

2084.8 --> 2096.02

no no no that's fine that's fine

2234.109 --> 2239.17
maybe good to have some feedback

2235.369 --> 2247.089
actually it's not personal

2239.17 --> 2251.9900000000002
concerns the entire world it's about

2247.089 --> 2256.839
Trump and about some things that are

2251.99 --> 2256.839
happening that are

2258.17 --> 2265.2400000000002
beyond dubious straight out terrible

2262.569 --> 2269.569
like really bad

2265.24 --> 2275.99
murder it'd be based on reality or on a

2269.569 --> 2281.15
fictional reality something I saw that

2275.99 --> 2287.019
was just so bad there's no way to

2281.15 --> 2287.0190000000002
justify it let me find it

2287.64 --> 2290.2999999999997
if I

2290.39 --> 2297.83
it's a Russia Today article though so

2293.21 --> 2301.1
yeah they do like to emphasize it and I

2297.83 --> 2305.08
have caught RT to have like social

2301.1 --> 2305.08
justice warrior influences even but

2306.88 --> 2313.55
seriously apparently according to this

2310.07 --> 2317.11
article is called straight straight out

2313.55 --> 2320.9900000000002
of dr. Strangelove it's quite on target

2317.11 --> 2329.03
analysts slam Trump's plan to trade

2320.99 --> 2332.4799999999996
nuclear secrets with Saudis so does

2329.03 --> 2334.78
anyone here or anywhere think that's a

2332.48 --> 2334.78
good idea

2336.16 --> 2341.6
can you can you tell me the the source

2338.87 --> 2343.43
of this horrible why Russia today I'll

2341.6 --> 2347.08
post it today I'll post it in chat I

2343.43 --> 2354.41
posted it in the early bird chat as well

2347.08 --> 2358.58
and yeah there's of course like nukes

2354.41 --> 2361.1299999999997
you don't want any real but just as a

2358.58 --> 2363.35
tension bringer right now it's like oh

2361.13 --> 2365.48
yeah oh that that's all we need we need

2363.35 --> 2369.56
just another player with nukes right

2365.48 --> 2373.13
there around Syria it's just freaking

2369.56 --> 2377.54
great Saudis are always the most being

2373.13 --> 2381.67
the most reliable people when it comes

2377.54 --> 2381.67
to that what the hell is he doing

2385.24 --> 2392.14
I I could be wrong but I think a lot of

2389.8 --> 2394.4500000000003
our technology in the country that I'm

2392.14 --> 2397.839
in they've actually handed over to

2394.45 --> 2400.089
Israel yeah yeah but you don't even need

2397.839 --> 2403.75
to start about that that's so widely

2400.089 --> 2405.94
known that's been there forever like

2403.75 --> 2408.849
look if there is some kind of technology

2405.94 --> 2413.17
out there the Israelis have it bottom

2408.849 --> 2415.3590000000004
line there is no denying that it doesn't

2413.17 --> 2417.819
matter anymore it's not about that it's

2415.359 --> 2421.39
about handing yet another country

2417.819 --> 2424.21
freakin nuclear technology if it is even

2421.39 --> 2426.25
real on the world stage political

2424.21 --> 2428.71
narrative [ __ ] and the maneuvering that

2426.25 --> 2431.44
the speech has but the geopolitical

2428.71 --> 2433.63
speed chess that's going on it is real

2431.44 --> 2440.16
enough it will have consequences and

2433.63 --> 2440.1600000000003
it's just why why are you doing this

2447.74 --> 2451.2099999999996
it's it's like

2454.19 --> 2459.91
it seriously pisses me off like I'm

2462.38 --> 2469.13
you know why it pisses me off because I

2465.92 --> 2471.53
don't want to end up saying yeah

2469.13 --> 2473.96
dammit there's freakin idiot social

2471.53 --> 2477.71
justice warriors were right I don't want

2473.96 --> 2480.07
to do that I don't want to this is just

2477.71 --> 2483.62
crazy

2480.07 --> 2486.11
what is it doing how is this making

2483.62 --> 2486.5899999999997
America great again is it making America

2486.11 --> 2488.3
great again

2486.59 --> 2490.4
or is it destroying the rest of the

2488.3 --> 2493.28
world to make America look somewhat

2490.4 --> 2495.4900000000002
great in comparison this is a military

2493.28 --> 2500.03
industrial [ __ ]

2495.49 --> 2503.6899999999996
why isn't he dismantling it why isn't he

2500.03 --> 2507.1600000000003
dismantling the military industry or is

2503.69 --> 2512.5
he actually taking care of the country

2507.16 --> 2517.1
this stupid Imperial [ __ ] I'm sick of it

2512.5 --> 2519.46
so so are we let me ask you how how much

2517.1 --> 2524.2
of it of this article do you think is

2519.46 --> 2524.2
theater or do you think it's for you I

2524.8 --> 2529.3100000000004
mean do you do you trust anything

2527.12 --> 2536.81
littering it there wouldn't be no

2529.31 --> 2539.0299999999997
article I just know I try to I try not

2536.81 --> 2543.02
to get caught up on anything that there

2539.03 --> 2548.26
yeah anything that they're trying to put

2543.02 --> 2551.78
out to the public I try to not let it

2548.26 --> 2554.8700000000003
not let it get to me or sometimes I just

2551.78 --> 2559.88
I think of it as theater you know well

2554.87 --> 2564.6099999999997
maybe in that case then [ __ ] Artie for

2559.88 --> 2569.11
manipulating you like that you know you

2564.61 --> 2569.11
just I don't know

2569.23 --> 2574.87
again I don't know anymore it's just I

2573.16 --> 2577.93
bump into this kind of [ __ ]

2574.87 --> 2585.0099999999998
I think yeah they could actually do that

2577.93 --> 2589.8399999999997
and Murr it's just all freakin lies all

2585.01 --> 2591.94
of it maybe this article is a lie but it

2589.84 --> 2596.77
just points at just how these things

2591.94 --> 2599.56
work and tells me that all these

2596.77 --> 2601.69
government's they're just playing a game

2599.56 --> 2605.62
and they don't give a [ __ ] about

2601.69 --> 2609.67
anything any promise any principle any

2605.62 --> 2613.7799999999997
concept any anything and it carried

2609.67 --> 2617.13
nothing nothing and the problem is that

2613.78 --> 2620.26
not folding doesn't even help that

2617.13 --> 2623.08
because these people will stay there in

2620.26 --> 2625.5400000000004
their positions basically in the waiting

2623.08 --> 2629.67
line until the people finally give them

2625.54 --> 2633.48
permission to openly screw them over

2629.67 --> 2633.48
because they're not gonna go away

2636.61 --> 2645.88
and it's everywhere all governments all

2640.21 --> 2648.67
I look back on the you know on the the

2645.88 --> 2651.88
drain the swamp idea and the make

2648.67 --> 2655.3
America great idea I look back on that

2651.88 --> 2660.31
and I'm like all that was [ __ ] it's

2655.3 --> 2661.78
just all [ __ ] to make people in this

2660.31 --> 2665.38
country I think that somebody is doing

2661.78 --> 2666.6600000000003
something about the bad [ __ ] you know so

2665.38 --> 2669.6400000000003
just sit right there

2666.66 --> 2673.81
and you wait you wait for these or

2669.64 --> 2676.87
breath you know no but look again and

2673.81 --> 2680.52
the funny thing is it was still good

2676.87 --> 2683.5299999999997
because yeah Hillary was openly

2680.52 --> 2688.29
admittedly gonna gut the country really

2683.53 --> 2691.65
quickly just like yeah I'm gonna tell it

2688.29 --> 2695.59
don't take me I'm gonna kill it

2691.65 --> 2697.57
that maniacal and Trump wasn't planning

2695.59 --> 2701.7400000000002
to do that but he's not changing the

2697.57 --> 2703.1200000000003
country he's not draining the swamp he's

2701.74 --> 2707.5
not dismantling the military-industrial

2703.12 --> 2713.17
complex he's not forbidding vaccines and

2707.5 --> 2719.4
GMO he is just taking all that evil [ __ ]

2713.17 --> 2719.4
and trying to keep the economy running

2719.91 --> 2727.69
even though it's literally murdering and

2722.83 --> 2732.18
retarding people well he is a

2727.69 --> 2739.87
businessman yeah but a businessman that

2732.18 --> 2742.7799999999997
deals in death just as fine maybe just

2739.87 --> 2745.33
doesn't like to deal in death so openly

2742.78 --> 2748.3500000000004
doesn't like to be a terror businessman

2745.33 --> 2751.98
or in a weird way

2748.35 --> 2751.98
manipulative yet but

2752.46 --> 2758.61
but he is apparently perfectly fine to

2755.37 --> 2761.31
just choose groups that are obviously

2758.61 --> 2764.4500000000003
killing the country and killing the

2761.31 --> 2768.21
world killing all life and just yeah

2764.45 --> 2774.12
just you could look these people blah

2768.21 --> 2777.42
blah blah [ __ ] you're an idiot you

2774.12 --> 2782.2799999999997
should remove them remove these freaking

2777.42 --> 2786.96
industries completely actually route out

2782.28 --> 2790.65
their crimes and let the people replace

2786.96 --> 2794.19
them with more sensible more profitable

2790.65 --> 2800.88
okay more profitable you idiots more

2794.19 --> 2804.63
profitable industries something you know

2800.88 --> 2807.84
what bugs me the most all that [ __ ]

2804.63 --> 2810.57
orange makeup anywhere that that

2807.84 --> 2816.03
triggers Miz yet that triggers me so

2810.57 --> 2818.1600000000003
that oh hey I know you I know you were

2816.03 --> 2823.61
all ready to talk about this but I saw

2818.16 --> 2823.6099999999997
you in Nathan Stallman's chat yesterday

2825.53 --> 2832.2000000000003
are you there yeah or why didn't you

2829.11 --> 2832.6800000000003
answer me I'm sorry I was distracted for

2832.2 --> 2834.66
a moment

2832.68 --> 2837.98
Oh somebody called me on the early wear

2834.66 --> 2837.98
chat she wouldn't do that

2843.02 --> 2849.18
are you on the phone now I don't know

2846.69 --> 2851.01
why he called me on skype if he wants to

2849.18 --> 2853.08
join then just join the link because

2851.01 --> 2857.42
yeah I'm not taking Skype calls during

2853.08 --> 2860.7
my head out anyway you were saying

2857.42 --> 2864.1800000000003
so I saw you yesterday and Nathan stall

2860.7 --> 2867.1499999999996
his chat mm-hmm and you know they were

2864.18 --> 2868.71
kind of over there celebrating about you

2867.15 --> 2870.96
know cuz he was actually the first one

2868.71 --> 2873.03
that presented this story to everybody

2870.96 --> 2875.01
and everybody was like no all Nathan why

2873.03 --> 2876.96
are you talking about this and now

2875.01 --> 2879.6000000000004
everybody's I gave Nathan you were right

2876.96 --> 2884.91
you were right so he just got a good win

2879.6 --> 2889.17
you know I guess well I've talked to

2884.91 --> 2890.79
Alex Jones in the YouTube chat when he

2889.17 --> 2893.82
was still allowed to livestream

2890.79 --> 2895.98
basically and in a sub stream I would be

2893.82 --> 2905.73
saying like yep Trump you know he's

2895.98 --> 2912.5
awesome and still Nets piss off [ __ ] you

2905.73 --> 2912.5
P Mars [ __ ] you bastard

2914.99 --> 2921.2299999999996
yeah

2917.57 --> 2923.42
wait I wasn't yeah you talk about Alex

2921.23 --> 2925.79
Jones right yeah and Alex in youtube

2923.42 --> 2926.69
think I would be saying like yeah Trump

2925.79 --> 2929.69
is awesome

2926.69 --> 2932.7200000000003
but what are you gonna do when he starts

2929.69 --> 2935.18
to go sideways and then go actually to

2932.72 --> 2937.58
the other side gradually not not just

2935.18 --> 2939.35
like a sudden switch what are you gonna

2937.58 --> 2941.5299999999997
do I'd like try to address

2939.35 --> 2944.21
Alex directly like what are you gonna do

2941.53 --> 2947.8700000000003
are you gonna stand the truth or are you

2944.21 --> 2953.63
going to be a merciless psychopath chill

2947.87 --> 2956.93
and it hurt that hurt him like I got

2953.63 --> 2962.9300000000003
banned immediately after that did I said

2956.93 --> 2967.2999999999997
that because I kind of weirdly saw it

2962.93 --> 2973.3399999999997
coming it's just the way he does things

2967.3 --> 2978.0800000000004
and the signs of being so self fulfilled

2973.34 --> 2982.34
and arrogant out of place cuz Trump does

2978.08 --> 2985.4
that he has like a real arrogance to him

2982.34 --> 2987.59
and sometimes it can be funny you know

2985.4 --> 2990.6800000000003
when he opposes liberals or see it and

2987.59 --> 2997.8500000000004
and it's kind of funny but he doesn't

2990.68 --> 2998.99
not do it he embraces worship and that's

2997.85 --> 3003.16
disgusting

2998.99 --> 3007.24
that's a disgusting human trait it is

3003.16 --> 3009.73
evil it is a nasty personality aspect

3007.24 --> 3013.2099999999996
that is a bit that should be a big

3009.73 --> 3015.91
warning sign to anyone anyone who likes

3013.21 --> 3018.66
to be worshipped who enjoys that is

3015.91 --> 3018.66
dangerous

3020.15 --> 3023.32
and yeah

3024.88 --> 3031.2400000000002
I don't know where this is going he

3028.48 --> 3033.58
seems to be just constantly always in

3031.24 --> 3035.5
the vague always balancing on yeah I

3033.58 --> 3037.99
might just go to the right way any

3035.5 --> 3039.61
moment and then suddenly he does

3037.99 --> 3042.0099999999998
something bad and select what the hell

3039.61 --> 3043.6600000000003
are you doing and then basically people

3042.01 --> 3045.94
start to get all foaming at the mouth

3043.66 --> 3047.98
and then he goes back to the good side

3045.94 --> 3050.58
and then he smashes those who doubted

3047.98 --> 3054.88
him he's like trying to weed out

3050.58 --> 3056.41
loyalists that don't purely absolutely

3054.88 --> 3059.56
worship him no matter what

3056.41 --> 3061.71
he's weeding them out and it's

3059.56 --> 3066.2799999999997
disgusting I'm sick of it

3061.71 --> 3068.29
I'm sick of him doing that he's treating

3066.28 --> 3070.4700000000003
us like weeds he's not even treating us

3068.29 --> 3076.96
like cattle he's treating up like weeds

3070.47 --> 3080.58
okay isn't that what they calls they

3076.96 --> 3085.2
calls cattle or that supposedly what the

3080.58 --> 3087.25
me dark Jewish ones that Elmo Tian's do

3085.2 --> 3087.9399999999996
but he's not even treating us like

3087.25 --> 3092.32
cattle

3087.94 --> 3094.92
he's just treating us like weeds and I'm

3092.32 --> 3094.92
sick of it

3098.74 --> 3105.79
I really don't like yeah it was good but

3104.02 --> 3112.5099999999998
it wasn't it was kind of good but I'm

3105.79 --> 3118.089
done sick of it I just think it's all

3112.51 --> 3121.9300000000003
theatre you know all these algorithms

3118.089 --> 3125.56
but social media YouTube I mean they can

3121.93 --> 3126.25
predict what we're gonna do better than

3125.56 --> 3129.0099999999998
we can

3126.25 --> 3134.23
and so they know exactly what to say

3129.01 --> 3142.1090000000004
they know exactly what to bring out it's

3134.23 --> 3142.109
like the perfect slave master system

3150.6 --> 3155.8199999999997
I think P Mars is [ __ ] with you

3152.61 --> 3157.8900000000003
though he's trying but he can yeah like

3155.82 --> 3162.7200000000003
yeah he's [ __ ] with you he just did

3157.89 --> 3165.27
some where this is cool I don't know I

3162.72 --> 3165.8999999999996
just got a message pop up my parents oh

3165.27 --> 3167.94
sure

3165.9 --> 3169.4700000000003
while he's doing that and he I had a

3167.94 --> 3178.08
back chat and he was doing that there

3169.47 --> 3185.2099999999996
and just I clicked it away shoutout to

3178.08 --> 3185.21
pilars she I had retracted there you go

3187.89 --> 3195.089
so anybody else wants to since I'm now

3191.369 --> 3197.46
opening me up this door right right so

3195.089 --> 3199.319
maybe you guys actually would like to

3197.46 --> 3201.48
have two balls to start talking about

3199.319 --> 3203.369
this [ __ ] on my show instead of just

3201.48 --> 3206.21
hanging it around in the sidelines and

3203.369 --> 3211.739
let arwing dig his own grave thank you

3206.21 --> 3214.589
but you have something to say because

3211.739 --> 3220.5190000000002
yeah this it I don't like it

3214.589 --> 3220.519
you know I I fear Trump in a way

3223.13 --> 3230.869
because only the darkest of people would

3226.839 --> 3232.849
put such a put up such a long act to

3230.869 --> 3236.299
play the good guy and then just

3232.849 --> 3241.579
gradually swing aside to become a

3236.299 --> 3246.71
complete imperialist it's only the most

3241.579 --> 3248.059
dangerous people do that so you ever

3246.71 --> 3249.89
thought about the other side you know

3248.059 --> 3252.2200000000003
what if what if Trump doesn't have a

3249.89 --> 3252.22
choice

3256.5 --> 3264.93
what we're what does that mean okay so I

3260.79 --> 3267.72
mean you you obviously you don't get to

3264.93 --> 3270.5989999999997
his position unless you're part of some

3267.72 --> 3272.52
type of blood blog or if you've [ __ ] a

3270.599 --> 3278.1600000000003
lot of people over during the way or you

3272.52 --> 3279.84
sold yourself out so I mean what if what

3278.16 --> 3283.2799999999997
if this was all planned what if this was

3279.84 --> 3290.07
intended to happen and he's fulfilling

3283.28 --> 3291.8100000000004
what he sold out to do well then he's

3290.07 --> 3295.02
just a freakin puppet and he's

3291.81 --> 3297.06
completely useless and a pretender and

3295.02 --> 3300.5099999999998
an actor an act well then oh everyone

3297.06 --> 3302.73
that how how come how come you let it

3300.51 --> 3307.8590000000004
get you so much what he's tell us the

3302.73 --> 3310.14
public does it bother you for the other

3307.859 --> 3312.06
people cuz you feel for the you also you

3310.14 --> 3317.22
don't need to get out of this

3312.06 --> 3319.619
this plan is end it's the end it's the

3317.22 --> 3321.3489999999997
total destruction of everything for no

3319.619 --> 3325.23
damn reason

3321.349 --> 3330.4700000000003
Alex been talking about this 20 years up

3325.23 --> 3333.06
until Trump okay and I was desperate

3330.47 --> 3336.54
everyone was desperate and Trump seemed

3333.06 --> 3340.7999999999997
like yeah he might actually kind of stop

3336.54 --> 3345.089
it or halt it and yeah and now we're all

3340.8 --> 3347.19
screwed goody

3345.089 --> 3349.41
so it's really a good outlook that

3347.19 --> 3352.609
there's actually no opposition really

3349.41 --> 3357.99
it's great you know it's everyone

3352.609 --> 3360.81
everyone everyone collectively insisting

3357.99 --> 3364.0989999999997
upon the end of humanity for no good

3360.81 --> 3364.099
reason it's just fantastic

3364.47 --> 3372.95
we gotta trust the play Harlem what plan

3370.079 --> 3378.2000000000003
the one we're not being told about

3372.95 --> 3378.2
miraculous reversing world intervention

3378.23 --> 3383.329
how can you trust a plan when you don't

3380.7 --> 3383.3289999999997
have one

3383.869 --> 3388.799
hey there's a lot of people out there

3386.16 --> 3391.95
that think there is one oh yeah but they

3388.799 --> 3395.069
don't know what it is right all right so

3391.95 --> 3400.41
you don't have one if you don't have a

3395.069 --> 3402.18
plan then what is there to trust you

3400.41 --> 3405.2889999999998
know except God

3402.18 --> 3408.47
oh yeah sure if there's no other choice

3405.289 --> 3408.4700000000003
you know

3411.02 --> 3417.41
and I'm panicked I look I'm semi

3415.369 --> 3420.53
panicking over this [ __ ] I talked to my

3417.41 --> 3424.8199999999997
healer about this because yeah he's gets

3420.53 --> 3428.8
real and he said some fascinating things

3424.82 --> 3434.3
through his ethereal connection is where

3428.8 --> 3439.67
yeah through the Angels that no it's not

3434.3 --> 3443.9
gonna be the end of the world but it

3439.67 --> 3448.1800000000003
sure as hell gonna seem like it and it's

3443.9 --> 3451.82
gonna be felt like it and just sucks

3448.18 --> 3456.23
look we got so much in this world so

3451.82 --> 3462.8
much potential so much new things so

3456.23 --> 3466.91
much ripened good things and why does it

3462.8 --> 3471.369
all have to be just destroyed and and

3466.91 --> 3474.25
ruined again you know why can't we just

3471.369 --> 3478.88
go with what we got

3474.25 --> 3482.81
yet reasonable get sensible and just

3478.88 --> 3485.6600000000003
make that great a better world but not

3482.81 --> 3489.35
even a greater just better can be done I

3485.66 --> 3493.0899999999997
just it doesn't make any sense to me it

3489.35 --> 3493.0899999999997
doesn't make any human sense to me

3493.96 --> 3505.73
well then they couldn't do psychological

3497.48 --> 3509.41
psyops oh goody and live without those

3505.73 --> 3513.01
right right we need those for what's

3509.41 --> 3513.0099999999998
behind control

3517.3 --> 3522.9100000000003
it makes sense though because once you

3519.58 --> 3525.94
kind of realize that in order for the

3522.91 --> 3530.08
domedown masses to feel like there needs

3525.94 --> 3536.77
to be a need for government the

3530.08 --> 3539.98
government makes the problem and then

3536.77 --> 3543.79
rolls out with a solution right while

3539.98 --> 3545.95
acting like they're here to save you yep

3543.79 --> 3548.05
when they were when they were the ones

3545.95 --> 3552.39
causing a bomb it's the phoenicians

3548.05 --> 3552.3900000000003
method and the Phoenix method

3561.69 --> 3564.68
he's crazy

3571.01 --> 3578.4700000000003
what what would it take you know just

3573.82 --> 3581.27
would it take everybody just ignore

3578.47 --> 3583.25
ignoring what what we're being told and

3581.27 --> 3583.849
we do all think I know what what would

3583.25 --> 3586.49
it take

3583.849 --> 3588.829
would it take it would people absolute

3586.49 --> 3590.859
sovereignty and every individual and

3588.829 --> 3596.78
their family becoming a government

3590.859 --> 3603.19
sovereign by themselves but yet to have

3596.78 --> 3607.7000000000003
a a voluntary collective spiritual

3603.19 --> 3611.589
connection to prevent the darkness from

3607.7 --> 3616.16
taking everyone down one by one

3611.589 --> 3618.23
can that happen you know it's very tough

3616.16 --> 3620.6499999999996
you know with power even individual

3618.23 --> 3624.53
power sovereignty true sovereignty comes

3620.65 --> 3627.05
that power and with that power seduction

3624.53 --> 3629.329
and you will see those outside that do

3627.05 --> 3632.3
not do this that are slaves and you will

3629.329 --> 3639.299
feel contempt for them and you might be

3632.3 --> 3644.9390000000003
able to be inclined to yeah

3639.299 --> 3648.299
feed into that contempt and it's very

3644.939 --> 3650.5789999999997
tough to have power of any kind it's

3648.299 --> 3652.949
very tough because it's not just you

3650.579 --> 3655.289
having the power it's you having the

3652.949 --> 3659.239
power and everything that comes with it

3655.289 --> 3662.0690000000004
in opposition to the rest of the world

3659.239 --> 3664.309
the contrast that's what makes it so

3662.069 --> 3664.3089999999997
hard

3664.729 --> 3671.4289999999996
it's a tough time being responsible it's

3668.729 --> 3673.769
not a joke okay with power comes

3671.429 --> 3679.679
responsibility it's not a trope it's not

3673.769 --> 3685.189
a joke it's it's underestimated very

3679.679 --> 3687.63
much so but also yeah there's it must

3685.189 --> 3691.219
just because it's hard doesn't mean that

3687.63 --> 3691.219
you can just not do it

3695.01 --> 3702.9
it's like this look the world forces you

3699.66 --> 3705.27
to suffer so are you gonna suffer for a

3702.9 --> 3708.05
good reason or are you gonna suffer for

3705.27 --> 3714.81
no reason at all it's your damn choice

3708.05 --> 3717.42
welcome to hell yeah I was gonna ask you

3714.81 --> 3723.0299999999997
does it have to get really bad before it

3717.42 --> 3725.33
gets any better is that the idea so they

3723.03 --> 3725.3300000000004
say

3727.41 --> 3731.7
I don't know anymore I just know that

3729.39 --> 3735.65
we're in such a happy complex cultural

3731.7 --> 3735.6499999999996
problem that

3742.98 --> 3748.589
I don't know maybe we just need to

3746.22 --> 3752.31
continue the awakening and see what

3748.589 --> 3756.869
happens with that awakening changes

3752.31 --> 3760.29
people how some will grow more dark or

3756.869 --> 3763.77
go through dark processes and and others

3760.29 --> 3768.7799999999997
will just suddenly crystallize in the

3763.77 --> 3772.079
right way and enlighten it's it's so

3768.78 --> 3775.7400000000002
ethereal sometimes that there's just no

3772.079 --> 3776.96
way to see over see it it's out of my

3775.74 --> 3779.7599999999998
hands

3776.96 --> 3782.48
like it makes people it's out of my

3779.76 --> 3785.4300000000003
hands oversight wise I just can't

3782.48 --> 3788.79
oversee it anymore and that frustrates

3785.43 --> 3794.04
the crap out of me because I want that

3788.79 --> 3796.23
insight I want and the problem is you

3794.04 --> 3797.7
gotta trust you gotta trust that which

3796.23 --> 3799.619
you do not know you gotta trust that

3797.7 --> 3805.14
there is some kind of sensibility God's

3799.619 --> 3808.619
plan at the same time it's really good

3805.14 --> 3811.71
to know how but yeah when you then reach

3808.619 --> 3813.78
those limits how you concede then

3811.71 --> 3817.02
because you're so used to seeing all

3813.78 --> 3821.19
these layers it is extra frustrating to

3817.02 --> 3823.23
not see beyond that point because if you

3821.19 --> 3824.7000000000003
don't see anything then everything is

3823.23 --> 3826.41
the same to you and it's not that

3824.7 --> 3829.79
frustrating because you know you don't

3826.41 --> 3829.79
know anything it doesn't really matter

3832.07 --> 3838.2200000000003
I feel your honor and it makes it makes

3836.66 --> 3839.6
you feel helpless sometimes right that's

3838.22 --> 3842.6299999999997
how I feel

3839.6 --> 3843.74
thank you : Turner for the superjet

3842.63 --> 3848.57
donation to bones

3843.74 --> 3850.91
thanks man yeah I'm gonna go um I'm

3848.57 --> 3857.57
gonna go get ready for my slave job to

3850.91 --> 3861.0499999999997
make bunny that has nobody to pay for a

3857.57 --> 3864.19
home that I'll leave vacant all day all

3861.05 --> 3868.96
right let's go home for your kids right

3864.19 --> 3874.82
Yeah right so it's not without value

3868.96 --> 3878.05
yeah well thank you uh don't worry about

3874.82 --> 3880.9700000000003
it thank you for the penis yes

3878.05 --> 3889.01
shout out to the mutt flutter shout out

3880.97 --> 3892.24
to ISA shout out to you all thinking

3889.01 --> 3895.63
about peace yeah you too

3892.24 --> 3895.6299999999997
so yeah

3897.11 --> 3904.58
it's not all completely hopeless guys

3899.91 --> 3904.58
it's just very frustrating sometimes but

3905.06 --> 3911.94
then again often I end up with after the

3908.25 --> 3914.19
frustration it's like a swing of the

3911.94 --> 3917.04
pendulum thing there's just moments like

3914.19 --> 3918.9900000000002
oh my god what is happening new [ __ ] and

3917.04 --> 3921.96
then it's like oh my god what did come

3918.99 --> 3926.43
out of this oh holy [ __ ] Nance

3921.96 --> 3929.31
oh my god what now ah damn it its life

3926.43 --> 3931.56
has become a roller coaster right right

3929.31 --> 3933.24
now also thanks to the Internet and it's

3931.56 --> 3937.46
all accelerating it's become of game

3933.24 --> 3939.8999999999996
speed chess and it just doesn't make any

3937.46 --> 3943.23
parents sense anymore even though it's

3939.9 --> 3946.64
kind of working but it just feels out

3943.23 --> 3952.23
there it feels surreal it feels beyond

3946.64 --> 3955.35
human and it's pisses me off

3952.23 --> 3957.96
it hurts me scares the [ __ ] out of me

3955.35 --> 3962.49
and then again it is freaking hilarious

3957.96 --> 3965.88
sometimes Andy did the multi-layered

3962.49 --> 3968.8799999999997
irony sarcasm and the synchronicities of

3965.88 --> 3970.7400000000002
the crystallizing meanings and the jokes

3968.88 --> 3976.7400000000002
that come out of them that is just

3970.74 --> 3979.5899999999997
mind-blowing as well so these are heavy

3976.74 --> 3984.8399999999997
times and it is the biggest roller

3979.59 --> 3987.8900000000003
coaster ride that at least the West has

3984.84 --> 3987.8900000000003
probably ever gone through

3994.13 --> 3999.739
yeah I'm noting sense of like big

3997.18 --> 4001.989
everything breaking down or blowing up

3999.739 --> 4005.94
but just the roller coaster right okay

4001.989 --> 4009.849
it keeps on going keeps on going happy

4005.94 --> 4012.069
despair exhilaration despair

4009.849 --> 4015.5190000000002
exhilaration despair that seems to be

4012.069 --> 4022.89
the bathroom here and yeah we're just

4015.519 --> 4028.4199999999996
gonna have to sit through it Hey

4022.89 --> 4029.8799999999997
hello Reese happy birthday man oh thanks

4028.42 --> 4034.4700000000003
a lot

4029.88 --> 4037.1800000000003
how are you doing yeah good you know you

4034.47 --> 4039.16
talk about my top my favorite topic

4037.18 --> 4043.839
again faith so I just thought I had to

4039.16 --> 4050.019
jump in a good Flat Earth priest

4043.839 --> 4059.71
blessing well I just it's just that you

4050.019 --> 4061.2389999999996
know the idea that it would be easy it

4059.71 --> 4065.259
would be kind of wishful thinking

4061.239 --> 4069.16
because you know I think the only way

4065.259 --> 4072.579
forward is for us as a collective you

4069.16 --> 4075.819
know everyone across the planet needs to

4072.579 --> 4080.17
stop focusing on what everybody else's

4075.819 --> 4082.18
looks like it sounds like and focus more

4080.17 --> 4086.2000000000003
on this effective we're all breathing

4082.18 --> 4092.7
there's a lot of Unknowing things in the

4086.2 --> 4092.7
world and we need to stop focusing

4094.18 --> 4102.599999999999
on the pity things TV familiar realities

4099.63 --> 4105.009
sorry so the game on trivialities and

4102.6 --> 4111.910000000001
exactly and you got some feedback by the

4105.009 --> 4115.66
way how about now I don't know

4111.91 --> 4119.469
no still feedback I don't know how to

4115.66 --> 4126.54
fix it maybe it turned down something I

4119.469 --> 4126.54
don't know uh mute and unmute me okay

4128.67 --> 4135.839
alright how's that

4130.33 --> 4139.62
let's see nope I don't know what to do

4135.839 --> 4145.12
maybe turn your volume down or something

4139.62 --> 4147.099999999999
alright okay I don't know my volume is

4145.12 --> 4150.13
very low so there might be some trouble

4147.1 --> 4152.17
okay can you still hear me properly yeah

4150.13 --> 4154.21
I can okay yeah there's still some

4152.17 --> 4156.6900000000005
feedback but it's not that bad don't

4154.21 --> 4156.69
worry about it

4157.92 --> 4163.51
yeah it's just awful

4161.34 --> 4169.3
yeah did it the other day and then it

4163.51 --> 4173.02
stopped doing it so I don't know but you

4169.3 --> 4175.87
know I've had a lot of I've had a lot of

4173.02 --> 4182.17
battles you know with the cattle people

4175.87 --> 4184.21
you know gory gory em and you know I

4182.17 --> 4189.46
just I just think that's not helping at

4184.21 --> 4192.57
all in a sense that they had their

4189.46 --> 4198.28
chance to be the chosen people but they

4192.57 --> 4202.03
they messed it up and now they're not

4198.28 --> 4205.12
the chosen or their self-proclaimed

4202.03 --> 4207.88
chosen right but they no longer the

4205.12 --> 4209.89
chosen well because they said that

4207.88 --> 4214.3
please let us not hear the voice of the

4209.89 --> 4215.740000000001
Lord again and it was granted they

4214.3 --> 4219.25
weren't the ones who share the final

4215.74 --> 4224.08
message really exactly I miss that

4219.25 --> 4226.12
miss Matthew 15:24 is very clear huh

4224.08 --> 4229.69
Jesus says I come only unto the lost

4226.12 --> 4231.46
sheep of Israel and the Quran comes

4229.69 --> 4234.7
along and says here's the message for

4231.46 --> 4236.5
everybody and the Quran it says I made

4234.7 --> 4238.99
you from different colors and creeds so

4236.5 --> 4240.7
that you could know each other not that

4238.99 --> 4244.2699999999995
you could fight to be who's the greatest

4240.7 --> 4249.09
on social media who's got the most likes

4244.27 --> 4253.0
and dislikes and things of this nature I

4249.09 --> 4256.4800000000005
mean the most important thing we need to

4253.0 --> 4258.21
realize is there's people on the in the

4256.48 --> 4261.94
world with more money than countries and

4258.21 --> 4266.47
there's still people starving right

4261.94 --> 4268.78
because they wanted exactly they want

4266.47 --> 4271.06
the contrast you know they wouldn't feel

4268.78 --> 4274.84
somewhat rich if there were people

4271.06 --> 4278.160000000001
suffering around them that they could do

4274.84 --> 4278.16
something about but won't

4278.62 --> 4284.18
yeah yeah they could do it they could

4282.23 --> 4289.19
they could have done a lot ten years ago

4284.18 --> 4292.97
you know they they could have done many

4289.19 --> 4297.32
things but like I say it's it's a choice

4292.97 --> 4299.81
it's a plan it's part of the plan

4297.32 --> 4303.32
well maybe it's also part of a curse

4299.81 --> 4306.620000000001
that they have when you gather that much

4303.32 --> 4309.44
money when you gather that much greed

4306.62 --> 4312.11
and power and then maybe whatever money

4309.44 --> 4314.509999999999
you are gonna spend even in some kind of

4312.11 --> 4319.599999999999
good intention is gonna end up

4314.51 --> 4322.25
corrupting those people well I think I

4319.6 --> 4326.120000000001
think think about it plan from the

4322.25 --> 4328.42
beginning you know people who get

4326.12 --> 4331.12
involved things and have some money

4328.42 --> 4333.5
there's a point where they told okay I

4331.12 --> 4334.94
know you want to do all this good but

4333.5 --> 4337.31
you know that we've got a plan going

4334.94 --> 4338.75
forward and you're miniscule in it and

4337.31 --> 4343.34
you're not gonna get in the way of it

4338.75 --> 4344.42
you know but I always like to look at

4343.34 --> 4346.82
this because you know it's all the

4344.42 --> 4348.5
different stick you know the different

4346.82 --> 4350.57
secret societies and all the things you

4348.5 --> 4352.94
hear about there's one in particular

4350.57 --> 4357.889999999999
skullenbones the numbers are three to

4352.94 --> 4359.78
two and underneath it's a crossbones and

4357.89 --> 4362.09
I think it's funny in the Quran you know

4359.78 --> 4364.34
fourteen hundred and thirty or forty

4362.09 --> 4365.900000000001
years ago two hundred forty years ago

4364.34 --> 4369.77
it's like fourteen hundred and thirty

4365.9 --> 4372.95
nine to forty years ago in chapter three

4369.77 --> 4376.22
verse 22 so using that same numbers huh

4372.95 --> 4379.19
those are they whose works have failed

4376.22 --> 4383.0
in the world and the hereafter they have

4379.19 --> 4388.549999999999
no helpers so again sorry they have no

4383.0 --> 4391.88
words that says those are they whose

4388.55 --> 4398.95
works have failed in the world and the

4391.88 --> 4401.6900000000005
hereafter and they have no helpers so

4398.95 --> 4403.82
that sounds it worse above that the

4401.69 --> 4407.15
verse above that said those who just

4403.82 --> 4409.79
believe the revelations of God and slay

4407.15 --> 4410.66
the prophets wrongfully and slay those

4409.79 --> 4414.8
of mankind

4410.66 --> 4420.65
to enjoin you enjoin equity promise them

4414.8 --> 4427.9400000000005
a painful doom so the idea that the

4420.65 --> 4431.469999999999
reward of this life is not found in this

4427.94 --> 4435.379999999999
life but rather that this life is a test

4431.47 --> 4440.780000000001
so your life is a test your success is a

4435.38 --> 4445.16
test your children are a test all of

4440.78 --> 4451.66
these things inside a world that's still

4445.16 --> 4456.76
very very unexplained but the biggest

4451.66 --> 4461.47
weapon they've used against us is

4456.76 --> 4470.24
division of the hearts of the people

4461.47 --> 4474.320000000001
nothing more nothing greater but that so

4470.24 --> 4476.9
when they say divide and conquer they

4474.32 --> 4480.5
divided the minds they divided the

4476.9 --> 4483.53
hearts they divided the religions they

4480.5 --> 4485.69
divided the people they made color

4483.53 --> 4492.139999999999
gradients they divided the size they

4485.69 --> 4497.509999999999
divided all of these things but if God

4492.14 --> 4501.34
is fully good then God would want good

4497.51 --> 4501.34
people first and foremost do you agree

4503.52 --> 4509.280000000001
yeah well that's exactly what it says

4509.43 --> 4515.860000000001
first and foremost if we could just deal

4513.82 --> 4519.04
equally with each other fairly with each

4515.86 --> 4522.37
other appreciating each and everybody

4519.04 --> 4526.36
else if these things could be

4522.37 --> 4530.23
established moving forward using the

4526.36 --> 4532.179999999999
history of the past as a guidelines like

4530.23 --> 4533.23
okay I'm gonna do that again we're not

4532.18 --> 4535.6
gonna do that again we're not gonna

4533.23 --> 4537.429999999999
treat people like that again I'm not

4535.6 --> 4541.3
gonna complain about this food while I'm

4537.43 --> 4543.700000000001
eating it a lot of people's staff all of

4541.3 --> 4546.55
these things will change the hearts and

4543.7 --> 4549.01
minds of the people back and there's a

4546.55 --> 4553.96
hell of a lot more of us stuck in the

4549.01 --> 4558.63
system than those who run it right but

4553.96 --> 4562.36
it has to come from within it has to be

4558.63 --> 4565.57
an individual look at every everybody

4562.36 --> 4567.94
every every single person has to look at

4565.57 --> 4569.5599999999995
themselves and say did I need to say

4567.94 --> 4571.089999999999
that did I need to think that am i

4569.56 --> 4574.14
spending too much time worrying about

4571.09 --> 4574.14
this person's life

4577.65 --> 4583.46
and would also be good if especially

4580.32 --> 4583.46
younger people would

4583.9 --> 4589.12
at some point learn to stop rebelling

4586.81 --> 4591.580000000001
against their elders and actually

4589.12 --> 4593.11
recognize that they also went through

4591.58 --> 4597.01
their own trials and may have some

4593.11 --> 4601.54
really interesting wisdom that they can

4597.01 --> 4604.42
take like a treasure from their family's

4601.54 --> 4611.5199999999995
past basically just like we can do it as

4604.42 --> 4611.52
a society from the Society's past

4613.05 --> 4620.74
exactly and it can only be told in that

4617.83 --> 4623.08
way because of the experience it can't

4620.74 --> 4625.54
be anything learned it has to be it had

4623.08 --> 4630.63
to be experienced that's the whole

4625.54 --> 4630.63
meaning of it Ryan

4631.55 --> 4636.719
it

4633.119 --> 4637.739
you know too many too many things can be

4636.719 --> 4639.78
like I yeah I heard that

4637.739 --> 4641.428999999999
yep I've heard that yeah sing that yeah

4639.78 --> 4644.55
how about you look into it

4641.429 --> 4647.389
you know how about you reevaluated how

4644.55 --> 4650.429
about you take another look at you know

4647.389 --> 4652.17
and that we we've talked different times

4650.429 --> 4654.96
about synchronicity and things like that

4652.17 --> 4659.849
in our lives but I think the things that

4654.96 --> 4661.08
wreck reoccur and keep coming back maybe

4659.849 --> 4661.7390000000005
we didn't look at them right the first

4661.08 --> 4663.989
time

4661.739 --> 4664.949
yeah we didn't see you maybe we take

4663.989 --> 4671.699
another look at it

4664.949 --> 4677.58
indeed and so I think I think it's all

4671.699 --> 4680.82
very well feel very well having these

4677.58 --> 4683.4
opinions and I know it's I know they're

4680.82 --> 4690.889
only just my opinion and I'm only just

4683.4 --> 4693.089999999999
one person but the only way I see this

4690.889 --> 4695.79
the only way I come up with these words

4693.09 --> 4700.82
as I imagine how the world could have

4695.79 --> 4700.82
peace how the children could grow up

4702.469 --> 4710.099
subject to even worrying about these

4706.05 --> 4712.83
things the systems and the in the end

4710.099 --> 4715.9800000000005
the government assist in the things in

4712.83 --> 4719.76
place that were meant to protect the

4715.98 --> 4722.79
youth growing up I'm just waiting for

4719.76 --> 4725.52
them to become part of the system where

4722.79 --> 4729.33
they old enough to pay taxes and move

4725.52 --> 4732.179
through it the sickest they must really

4729.33 --> 4734.88
have a choice so that's what I think

4732.179 --> 4736.4400000000005
what I think is that they must realize

4734.88 --> 4739.83
during the course of their life that I

4736.44 --> 4742.29
have a choice and it's not just like

4739.83 --> 4745.11
yeah you're gonna choose to go with the

4742.29 --> 4752.21
flow or you're gonna be at a loser

4745.11 --> 4755.098999999999
basically exactly and that's part of the

4752.21 --> 4759.3
that's part of the adults as well you

4755.099 --> 4763.619000000001
know like we have to show them the way

4759.3 --> 4764.72
we have to we have they have to first be

4763.619 --> 4769.07
willing

4764.72 --> 4773.900000000001
but we also have to be on a whole huge

4769.07 --> 4777.7699999999995
scale able to provide something worth

4773.9 --> 4781.03
taking the time to look at and so if you

4777.77 --> 4786.290000000001
you know if you grow up and you know

4781.03 --> 4790.73
using my you know example you know know

4786.29 --> 4793.94
if I had a family that was always saying

4790.73 --> 4796.37
you know don't like the Asians don't

4793.94 --> 4797.87
like them done like this you know then

4796.37 --> 4803.42
you grew up with a mindset that it's

4797.87 --> 4806.0599999999995
okay but it's not okay you know it's not

4803.42 --> 4810.9800000000005
okay to judge another person you know

4806.06 --> 4812.42
and Jesus said just judge not lest you

4810.98 --> 4815.33
be judged and you'll be judged in the

4812.42 --> 4817.16
same way that you judge and that could

4815.33 --> 4820.07
that could mean consequences in your

4817.16 --> 4823.04
life yep but the idea that we would

4820.07 --> 4825.65
focus on any aspect of another person's

4823.04 --> 4827.45
life that we're not directly going to

4825.65 --> 4829.33
contribute we don't know the damage that

4827.45 --> 4831.889999999999
we could cause and that person's life

4829.33 --> 4834.65
constructive criticism that's one thing

4831.89 --> 4838.610000000001
but a nasty comment that might be the

4834.65 --> 4840.349999999999
two hundred fifty four fourth time that

4838.61 --> 4843.11
person's heard that comment and then

4840.35 --> 4845.63
might push them over the edge yeah

4843.11 --> 4849.139999999999
the drop that made the bucket spill kind

4845.63 --> 4852.650000000001
of thing exactly exactly and the idea

4849.14 --> 4856.22
that you know it's okay and it's okay to

4852.65 --> 4858.74
be that okay to do this this can be a

4856.22 --> 4861.14
weakening factor as well within the

4858.74 --> 4863.599999999999
human psyche and then with did the

4861.14 --> 4865.820000000001
person themself the human spirit can be

4863.6 --> 4868.67
denied through scientific are well yeah

4865.82 --> 4870.71
you know why I can be like this because

4868.67 --> 4873.62
it's just emotional there's so much more

4870.71 --> 4875.21
like ina agree and disagree a little bit

4873.62 --> 4878.78
because for example

4875.21 --> 4881.66
yeah when some glowers are concerned I I

4878.78 --> 4885.71
do sometimes just get allergic reactions

4881.66 --> 4888.17
and go completely vile and not too

4885.71 --> 4890.829
terrible but just vile enough but then

4888.17 --> 4894.099
afterwards I realize also like oh yeah

4890.829 --> 4896.558999999999
[ __ ] they're probably on there a lot of

4894.099 --> 4899.859
pressure you know this is not AI

4896.559 --> 4903.359
something I should be doing per default

4899.859 --> 4906.339
every single time it's more like my

4903.359 --> 4908.589
expression of my revulsion of what

4906.339 --> 4910.239
they're doing but yeah I still have to

4908.589 --> 4914.949
recognize they're several persons in a

4910.239 --> 4918.459
situation dealing with things and still

4914.949 --> 4921.159
being kind of careful so I get what you

4918.459 --> 4923.349
didn't get what you mean that ability to

4921.159 --> 4924.909
catch yourself and be like well I kind

4923.349 --> 4927.189
of stepped off the straight path there

4924.909 --> 4929.379
for a minute I can kind of rectify that

4927.189 --> 4930.729
the fact that you can go back and change

4929.379 --> 4933.6089999999995
that in the future then you've learned

4930.729 --> 4935.829000000001
some kind of lesson and then the next

4933.609 --> 4938.05
time you know you won't be as triggered

4935.829 --> 4939.549999999999
because I'm about to be triggered I mean

4938.05 --> 4941.769
even this word trigger there's a new

4939.55 --> 4945.789
thing you know so triggered this

4941.769 --> 4947.469
triggered that and you know triggered it

4945.789 --> 4950.829
supposed to get is just being triggered

4947.469 --> 4954.669
to supposedly assign a weakness hmm

4950.829 --> 4957.639
that's you know trigger does is a now

4954.669 --> 4959.8589999999995
blanket statement you know you know what

4957.639 --> 4962.32
happened to inspired what happened to

4959.859 --> 4965.530000000001
move what happened to it gave me an

4962.32 --> 4968.289
impression you know Japanese have a word

4965.53 --> 4971.409
Condor stuff and that means that means I

4968.289 --> 4977.49
was impressed you know you know so it's

4971.409 --> 4982.53
like you know it can be it's just

4977.49 --> 4986.7
the technology that could literally weed

4982.53 --> 4989.099999999999
out every bad egg in society is being

4986.7 --> 4990.929999999999
used as a platform to procure snow now

4989.1 --> 4992.9400000000005
I'm the best nothing that I'm the best

4990.93 --> 4993.6
no no no no no look at me look at look

4992.94 --> 4996.179999999999
at what I've got

4993.6 --> 4998.610000000001
I'm the best no no no look I I mean like

4996.18 --> 5004.22
we can take it with us or something you

4998.61 --> 5007.429999999999
know and so what what do the youths have

5004.22 --> 5009.95
growing up now and it goes backwards

5007.43 --> 5011.93
down to the children you know the youth

5009.95 --> 5013.179999999999
is one thing but the children looking at

5011.93 --> 5015.56
the youth who were already being

5013.18 --> 5018.29
influenced by the adults who were trying

5015.56 --> 5022.370000000001
to stay a young service so it's the

5018.29 --> 5029.23
cycle you know but deep at the core we

5022.37 --> 5032.48
need to focus on what we actually care

5029.23 --> 5035.599999999999
about and why we care so much about

5032.48 --> 5038.589999999999
something exterior and why does it make

5035.6 --> 5044.14
us go to extra mile to attack somebody I

5038.59 --> 5046.91
mean I like to I like to look at every

5044.14 --> 5051.700000000001
every encounter that I have in my day as

5046.91 --> 5055.25
a test for the words that I'm saying now

5051.7 --> 5059.45
totally and moving forward yeah for me

5055.25 --> 5063.89
the same you know I couldn't even not do

5059.45 --> 5067.34
it anymore it's like I must take

5063.89 --> 5071.200000000001
everything that serious because there's

5067.34 --> 5071.2
just no way to go back anymore

5071.5 --> 5077.2
and use this like part of walking a path

5074.54 --> 5082.25
like once you go to a certain narrowness

5077.2 --> 5084.639999999999
you just can't go back it will mean

5082.25 --> 5084.64
death

5084.989 --> 5093.69
I agree and so you know I'm I can even

5092.58 --> 5096.33
imagine

5093.69 --> 5098.179999999999
I kind of see the comments right now but

5096.33 --> 5102.42
I can imagine the different comments and

5098.18 --> 5106.38
that might come or whatever and I have

5102.42 --> 5108.6
to react with those like out of out of

5106.38 --> 5111.54
like an unjust a point of understanding

5108.6 --> 5114.870000000001
you know and I think each time we we go

5111.54 --> 5116.67
through and look at the look at the

5114.87 --> 5119.82
level of how much it actually affects

5116.67 --> 5121.83
your life it's more then you have to do

5119.82 --> 5126.179999999999
and look at how much you're engaging in

5121.83 --> 5130.17
that moment and so it's a balance but I

5126.18 --> 5132.06
think if we can share the good and the

5130.17 --> 5137.31
beauty and the amazing things of this

5132.06 --> 5139.38
world will fight for it more rather than

5137.31 --> 5141.780000000001
the thing that I can buy first at the

5139.38 --> 5143.82
shop and then I can put it online now

5141.78 --> 5149.009999999999
I'm not saying you can't have nice

5143.82 --> 5153.42
things but it's just it's the it's the

5149.01 --> 5155.31
material world that drives the standard

5153.42 --> 5159.9890000000005
through everything right and it's only

5155.31 --> 5161.610000000001
novelty exactly it runs out and people

5159.989 --> 5164.79
gotta realize that that they're becoming

5161.61 --> 5167.58
obsessed with things they know if they

5164.79 --> 5170.19
think about carefully will lose its

5167.58 --> 5176.08
shine it's not gonna end up meaning

5170.19 --> 5180.32
anything exactly exactly and

5176.08 --> 5186.0199999999995
it's it's a it's a it's a level of focus

5180.32 --> 5188.24
and I can't not help keep myself in

5186.02 --> 5190.1
check every day like look at what I'm

5188.24 --> 5192.59
saying when I'm saying it why I'm saying

5190.1 --> 5200.6900000000005
it how long I've spent saying it you

5192.59 --> 5203.6900000000005
know and you know it's just I'm glad

5200.69 --> 5206.719999999999
that I have that awareness you know

5203.69 --> 5210.219999999999
although it's a weight of cognition that

5206.72 --> 5213.2300000000005
others may not have put on themselves

5210.22 --> 5215.900000000001
I'm glad I have that awareness no I'm

5213.23 --> 5219.799999999999
glad that I that I don't have a racist

5215.9 --> 5223.7
bone in my body I'm glad that I pushed

5219.8 --> 5227.63
that all behind me you know and things

5223.7 --> 5229.42
my things might surprise me and I might

5227.63 --> 5234.68
see something I've never seen before but

5229.42 --> 5236.6
to me it exists it's alive and it wasn't

5234.68 --> 5241.22
part of a natural disaster and it wasn't

5236.6 --> 5242.96
part of some you know war-torn area and

5241.22 --> 5245.150000000001
that person exists and that person can

5242.96 --> 5246.8
choose and that person can make the

5245.15 --> 5249.17
right decision and I'm not the one to

5246.8 --> 5251.27
judge them and I can't judge someone off

5249.17 --> 5253.7300000000005
just the smallest piece of their life

5251.27 --> 5254.75
and that's who you are and that's what

5253.73 --> 5257.15
you've done and that's what you will

5254.75 --> 5260.15
always be it's ridiculous yeah but

5257.15 --> 5264.28
that's like reductionism because I

5260.15 --> 5267.259999999999
consider more carefully that yeah I do

5264.28 --> 5270.679999999999
kind of sort of have racist elements

5267.26 --> 5274.67
that's to me but I don't over generalize

5270.68 --> 5277.55
with that and it's more about type of

5274.67 --> 5281.15
characters with certain types of body

5277.55 --> 5284.820000000001
suits as it were and yeah some type of

5281.15 --> 5287.969999999999
body suits example black people

5284.82 --> 5289.65
Asian people they have these the

5287.97 --> 5292.110000000001
spectrum of characters that are

5289.65 --> 5295.5599999999995
typically in there and some are just

5292.11 --> 5299.07
super awesome and others are typically

5295.56 --> 5303.0
terrible in a certain fashion and then

5299.07 --> 5305.82
another group another race bodysuits I'd

5303.0 --> 5309.14
have the same type of spectrum with

5305.82 --> 5312.45
awesome people's at one part and just

5309.14 --> 5314.85
terrible in a certain way on the other

5312.45 --> 5317.099999999999
type and in that sense I do consider

5314.85 --> 5319.410000000001
myself racist because I distinguish

5317.1 --> 5321.51
between the differences but the most

5319.41 --> 5324.599999999999
important part is I don't over

5321.51 --> 5325.89
generalize it I don't think that just

5324.6 --> 5330.120000000001
because there are a couple of these

5325.89 --> 5332.610000000001
people the thug types race that that

5330.12 --> 5334.349999999999
means they're all like that because

5332.61 --> 5336.8099999999995
that's the real racism it's the

5334.35 --> 5340.9400000000005
deduction ISM it's just putting it all

5336.81 --> 5344.67
over one comb that's real racism to

5340.94 --> 5347.37
decipher up the good parts to ignore

5344.67 --> 5350.28
that that's real real essence Irish

5347.37 --> 5351.9
isn't it you know and like if we look at

5350.28 --> 5353.61
it the way the world goes it's kind of

5351.9 --> 5356.21
encouraged you know it's easier to

5353.61 --> 5359.46
blanket rather than look at individual

5356.21 --> 5361.2
corporations do it Harper I call it

5359.46 --> 5363.39
corporate deduction is immense

5361.2 --> 5365.63
what Marxism does is all over

5363.39 --> 5368.22
generalizing all over simplifying

5365.63 --> 5372.51
putting it all over one Khomeini for

5368.22 --> 5375.84
like declaring insane things like yeah

5372.51 --> 5378.72
all black people are racist against

5375.84 --> 5380.81
whites and we're supposed to they're

5378.72 --> 5385.55
supposed to be like that that kind of

5380.81 --> 5390.570000000001
insane over generalization it's so crazy

5385.55 --> 5397.860000000001
it's a basic racism it's beyond being a

5390.57 --> 5401.7
simpleton it's reinforced math yeah it's

5397.86 --> 5403.62
correctly and it doesn't give any room

5401.7 --> 5406.659
for improvement because they've already

5403.62 --> 5410.8
been written off you know and

5406.659 --> 5413.44
all right it's easy it's easy to go like

5410.8 --> 5415.03
is a All Whites the racist against flags

5413.44 --> 5416.23
all flags a racist think it's whites and

5415.03 --> 5418.36
there's no always gonna be like that

5416.23 --> 5420.849999999999
versus sayings there are some people who

5418.36 --> 5423.429
just can't find it in themselves to love

5420.85 --> 5425.35
each other and give everybody the equal

5423.429 --> 5428.2300000000005
opportunity they don't have to do they

5425.35 --> 5431.59
don't have to agree and they don't have

5428.23 --> 5433.599999999999
to even enjoy that person life for all

5431.59 --> 5435.55
but if they're not hurting anybody and

5433.6 --> 5441.01
it's simply just the way they look think

5435.55 --> 5443.17
man it's 2019 grow up yes seriously take

5441.01 --> 5445.63
a good look and if it takes longer stand

5443.17 --> 5448.81
in the mirror for 10 minutes and say

5445.63 --> 5451.51
save yourself 10 times every minute

5448.81 --> 5455.909000000001
every minute that passes say I could be

5451.51 --> 5459.4800000000005
them I could be them that could be me

5455.909 --> 5463.0599999999995
right because it could have been you and

5459.48 --> 5464.709999999999
it's this the idea that the idea that

5463.06 --> 5469.330000000001
these levels of people

5464.71 --> 5472.69
I just can't his level of decency but

5469.33 --> 5474.37
that has nothing to do with what you

5472.69 --> 5476.169999999999
look like what you sound like what

5474.37 --> 5479.98
country you're from what color you were

5476.17 --> 5482.35
and even at a certain point what age you

5479.98 --> 5484.419999999999
are there's a certain point when you

5482.35 --> 5485.860000000001
know with the intent in your heart that

5484.42 --> 5487.12
you're saying something with malice

5485.86 --> 5491.11
they're just saying something racist

5487.12 --> 5493.7699999999995
that you're doing it to burn or sky that

5491.11 --> 5497.549999999999
person emotionally if you can and that

5493.77 --> 5500.580000000001
is not the way to move forward no

5497.55 --> 5504.1900000000005
calling people cattle and thinking is

5500.58 --> 5507.5199999999995
any way around it it's only gonna be a

5504.19 --> 5508.8099999999995
backlash all right and so while the one

5507.52 --> 5511.0
they do I don't believe we I don't

5508.81 --> 5514.4490000000005
believe we do that that's actually a

5511.0 --> 5516.82
scare tactic exactly it's dehumanizing

5514.449 --> 5519.5199999999995
like yeah your cattle you don't even

5516.82 --> 5522.04
know it I know things about you that you

5519.52 --> 5526.0
will never learn and that scariness

5522.04 --> 5529.929
that's like the overlords thing and it

5526.0 --> 5534.1
works that's a problem it worse I asked

5529.929 --> 5536.08
exactly right that exact works if you

5534.1 --> 5537.4800000000005
grow up if you grow up believing I

5536.08 --> 5541.59
believe what says something in the

5537.48 --> 5543.839999999999
with something like the the Gentiles are

5541.59 --> 5545.64
made from one of the six spheres of six

5543.84 --> 5548.9400000000005
six satanic spheres and they are not

5545.64 --> 5550.38
like they are not like us so right there

5548.94 --> 5553.62
you grow up from the young age right

5550.38 --> 5555.84
through to to your old age thinking that

5553.62 --> 5557.21
you're literally made from a different

5555.84 --> 5559.77
cloth

5557.21 --> 5563.24
all the while not realizing you're

5559.77 --> 5572.330000000001
probably giving your soul away you know

5563.24 --> 5576.24
and so I think I think we need to stop

5572.33 --> 5577.86
sacrificing the goodness of the future

5576.24 --> 5580.26
that could come for the people that come

5577.86 --> 5582.78
after us when we're long and gone you

5580.26 --> 5585.030000000001
know because we're not gonna live

5582.78 --> 5587.84
forever we will wanna have a great time

5585.03 --> 5591.54
but the best time is when there's no

5587.84 --> 5593.49
problems or fighting and you know the

5591.54 --> 5595.58
best times are when you have something

5593.49 --> 5601.3099999999995
to look forward to

5595.58 --> 5601.3099999999995
exactly exactly you know like I

5605.989 --> 5610.94
so if it's a bit easier for me to return

5609.11 --> 5613.4
to that mindset and be like oh yeah

5610.94 --> 5615.2
that's right I remember now all of this

5613.4 --> 5622.089999999999
means nothing if you could lose it all

5615.2 --> 5624.5
in a second you know and so I don't I

5622.09 --> 5626.33
don't forget the blessings that I've

5624.5 --> 5628.07
been showing I don't forget the

5626.33 --> 5630.2
blessings that I have I don't forget the

5628.07 --> 5631.79
opportunities that I've been given and I

5630.2 --> 5637.46
certainly want to give it back as soon

5631.79 --> 5640.91
as I can but if we shut off and we don't

5637.46 --> 5642.77
share these things we all become cold in

5640.91 --> 5647.84
the world's gonna be a pretty cold place

5642.77 --> 5651.02
and if we carry on these these trends

5647.84 --> 5653.21
that we have trying to reach Heights

5651.02 --> 5654.92
will never reach because the literally

5653.21 --> 5659.719
have been sitting another playing field

5654.92 --> 5661.9400000000005
will always feel less but if we remember

5659.719 --> 5664.04
that each one of us was created at a

5661.94 --> 5667.009999999999
certain time in a certain place and if

5664.04 --> 5669.71
we're still here right now then it has

5667.01 --> 5670.219
meaning then there's something to shoot

5669.71 --> 5672.2
for

5670.219 --> 5675.14
there's something to strive for there's

5672.2 --> 5681.139999999999
something to to move towards whatever

5675.14 --> 5684.200000000001
that might be yeah and I think that's my

5681.14 --> 5687.71
focus for this year you know that's my

5684.2 --> 5690.139999999999
focus moving forward us is to take each

5687.71 --> 5692.0
day as it comes but to realize and never

5690.14 --> 5694.1900000000005
forget each blessing as well no matter

5692.0 --> 5698.18
how old I get hmm

5694.19 --> 5700.489
because so many people have been subject

5698.18 --> 5702.83
to the atrocities of the choices of a

5700.489 --> 5706.489
few people that just wanted more for

5702.83 --> 5709.07
themselves instead of giving more to the

5706.489 --> 5712.79
greater good more to the masses they

5709.07 --> 5716.09
wanted to be there if only they had just

5712.79 --> 5720.26
learned to enjoy other people being

5716.09 --> 5722.2390000000005
happy exactly if they only had not

5720.26 --> 5724.4890000000005
discard to that spot

5722.239 --> 5729.759999999999
now have been fooled into believing that

5724.489 --> 5729.759999999999
that is worthless then yeah

5732.37 --> 5740.0199999999995
I agree so let's try to learn that

5736.0 --> 5743.77
lesson for future generations so future

5740.02 --> 5744.870000000001
generations do not make that ridiculous

5743.77 --> 5748.240000000001
mistake

5744.87 --> 5751.24
exactly and like I said we've got enough

5748.24 --> 5752.86
history we've got enough things of the

5751.24 --> 5754.0599999999995
past and I thought rasa teas to look

5752.86 --> 5756.28
back and say we're not gonna do that

5754.06 --> 5758.26
again we're not gonna allow that to

5756.28 --> 5759.94
happen again right look what that did to

5758.26 --> 5762.16
this whole area when we let that happen

5759.94 --> 5766.589999999999
so there doesn't have to be any more

5762.16 --> 5771.07
violence racism / bickering fighting

5766.59 --> 5774.7
murdering all this horrible stuff that

5771.07 --> 5778.54
goes on artificial scarcities yeah all

5774.7 --> 5780.5199999999995
of this stuff doesn't have to be talk of

5778.54 --> 5786.5199999999995
war there doesn't have to be all these

5780.52 --> 5790.6900000000005
things if we just simply all put down

5786.52 --> 5793.09
our defenses all stop fighting all stop

5790.69 --> 5796.2699999999995
the racism all just try to go through

5793.09 --> 5798.49
life going you know what this is a

5796.27 --> 5801.52
pretty amazing place we get to live on

5798.49 --> 5803.679999999999
for some reason mm-hmm well I wouldn't

5801.52 --> 5807.55
go as far as to putting out down all our

5803.68 --> 5811.110000000001
defense systems you know that times not

5807.55 --> 5814.35
come yet but if we just stop attacking

5811.11 --> 5817.929999999999
then we'll get very far if we stop

5814.35 --> 5820.360000000001
acting like predators like we need to

5817.93 --> 5822.67
attack others to improve ourselves that

5820.36 --> 5824.349999999999
would be a great start but self-defense

5822.67 --> 5827.56
and we're gonna need that for a while we

5824.35 --> 5829.780000000001
actually have to reinforce that because

5827.56 --> 5833.47
that's being taken away to make us into

5829.78 --> 5836.44
slaves first I think you need to learn

5833.47 --> 5839.59
to defend ourselves again and embrace

5836.44 --> 5842.74
that natural law that divine right of

5839.59 --> 5844.84
self-defense personal sovereignty and

5842.74 --> 5848.8
then we can

5844.84 --> 5853.6900000000005
move on from that point and maybe yeah

5848.8 --> 5855.46
fine where we can just recognize like

5853.69 --> 5859.99
okay there's no more predators out there

5855.46 --> 5864.0
okay we can now become one again but

5859.99 --> 5869.53
it's gonna take some effort to get there

5864.0 --> 5873.94
so I agree but I think if we just if we

5869.53 --> 5880.0599999999995
could just stop focusing on the

5873.94 --> 5881.5
aesthetic of everything you know and

5880.06 --> 5887.080000000001
it's

5881.5 --> 5890.85
shut your eyes and talk I still disagree

5887.08 --> 5893.38
livid oh so you know the aesthetic its

5890.85 --> 5895.18
aesthetic is just an extra on top if

5893.38 --> 5898.33
you're gonna use a static to hide

5895.18 --> 5903.76
yourself underneath yeah then it's just

5898.33 --> 5906.73
stupid but a steady can emphasize what

5903.76 --> 5910.17
is inside as well I'm talking about the

5906.73 --> 5915.129999999999
aesthetic that divides I mean color I

5910.17 --> 5918.01
mean sighs you know I mean all these

5915.13 --> 5921.07
things the aesthetic that divides you

5918.01 --> 5923.2
and your mind is like wait a minute why

5921.07 --> 5927.91
do I have more right to live than that

5923.2 --> 5930.01
person you don't and that's where it

5927.91 --> 5936.18
comes down to content of the character

5930.01 --> 5942.01
you know I mean if it really was a dream

5936.18 --> 5944.14
for Martin Luther but there are people

5942.01 --> 5950.08
on this planet people listening now they

5944.14 --> 5953.29
get it the content of character goes

5950.08 --> 5954.82
beyond anything and I guess it was the

5953.29 --> 5955.36
you know Jesus saying know them by their

5954.82 --> 5958.03
fruits

5955.36 --> 5963.219999999999
what do they produce yep that's my

5958.03 --> 5965.0199999999995
red-clawed sorry that's my favorite work

5963.22 --> 5969.1
also because fruits

5965.02 --> 5970.93
I like fruits gardens fruits and it's so

5969.1 --> 5975.88
true it's so tell all those people

5970.93 --> 5979.360000000001
Michele yeah God there there are 33g

5975.88 --> 5981.55
material in their name and like oh god

5979.36 --> 5984.219999999999
how many times this happened and it's

5981.55 --> 5987.22
always like look what do they actually

5984.22 --> 5990.67
do what does come out of them how have

5987.22 --> 5992.95
they changed over time that's really

5990.67 --> 5995.28
that's where you yeah where the

5992.95 --> 5998.01
judgments should be focused on and

5995.28 --> 6000.96
that's basically it

5998.01 --> 6002.45
what do they do what is the result in

6000.96 --> 6006.6
great

6002.45 --> 6009.57
agreed right hey if you don't mind I I

6006.6 --> 6013.200000000001
want to run out the shows whoo

6009.57 --> 6015.09
yeah no worries but and I just wanna I

6013.2 --> 6017.97
just wanna I just want to say one thing

6015.09 --> 6021.150000000001
because I'm always coming from a point

6017.97 --> 6025.5
of faith than I I do feel it as kind of

6021.15 --> 6029.25
a bias but I just want to say this there

6025.5 --> 6035.03
are atheists out there that are really

6029.25 --> 6038.49
good people they're loving hard-working

6035.03 --> 6041.28
great parents but maybe they just

6038.49 --> 6044.34
haven't been showing or what the right

6041.28 --> 6045.84
way because of their upbringing rather

6044.34 --> 6048.42
than getting to choose they were chosen

6045.84 --> 6055.4400000000005
and then pushed away it as a way of

6048.42 --> 6060.26
rebellion but I feel that you have to

6055.44 --> 6063.599999999999
stop seeking and when you stop seeking

6060.26 --> 6066.150000000001
that's when you decided you don't need

6063.6 --> 6068.400000000001
God and I think when you say you don't

6066.15 --> 6073.32
need God that will be the void you

6068.4 --> 6077.639999999999
always try to fill all right all right

6073.32 --> 6079.44
so I wanna say yeah great well thanks

6077.64 --> 6083.42
for having me Owen yeah thanks for being
