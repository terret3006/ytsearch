morning

76.479 --> 80.4
welcome to flat earth early bird number

982

80.4 --> 84.799
i'm your host arwyn and before we start

82.72 --> 87.28
the show please don't forget to share it

the weather today is

117.36 --> 121.92
beautiful

119.04 --> 123.36000000000001
surprisingly wind still

121.92 --> 126.799
and just look at

123.36 --> 128.8
this cloudscape it's like

126.799 --> 131.59900000000002
pretty astounding site

128.8 --> 133.68
there are some trails though as you can

131.599 --> 135.35999999999999
see

133.68 --> 139.20000000000002
further above

135.36 --> 142.87900000000002
and some haze layer so yeah they are

139.2 --> 145.76
cloud seeding whatever that is

142.879 --> 148.39999999999998
like with whatever they do that i mean

145.76 --> 151.92
but yeah what a beautiful sight and look

148.4 --> 156.31900000000002
at how almost purple blue

151.92 --> 158.16
clear the sky is in between there

156.319 --> 159.04
pretty beautiful

158.16 --> 159.84
very

159.04 --> 161.519
very

159.84 --> 163.76
nice

161.519 --> 166.31900000000002
and it's warm it's nice and warm outside

163.76 --> 166.319
too so

169.12 --> 176.16
very nice sunday afternoon

173.28 --> 177.76
here in the netherlands

176.16 --> 180.72
right

177.76 --> 183.12
so hello dank first in chat i am back

180.72 --> 186.08
indeed back on youtube

183.12 --> 189.20000000000002
hello rob h pj krishank

186.08 --> 192.959
rocket blimps captain caveman

189.2 --> 194.79999999999998
right have you all missed me here

192.959 --> 198.64000000000001
i think some of you didn't even know

194.8 --> 201.44
that i was on d live

198.64 --> 201.44
this whole week

201.519 --> 206.08
but i was

203.28 --> 208.959
unfortunately though i couldn't actually

206.08 --> 210.56
i don't know upload a video or anything

208.959 --> 213.68
saying

210.56 --> 215.599
like hey i'm on d live right now so yeah

213.68 --> 217.59900000000002
i had to communicate all of that through

215.599 --> 220.319
nathan oakley's show

217.599 --> 222.56
and i did do that a couple of times also

220.319 --> 225.04
put out the link in chat to the my d

222.56 --> 226.959
live channel but apparently

225.04 --> 231.67999999999998
some of you don't watch the flat earth

226.959 --> 231.68
debates and yeah then you don't find out

232.879 --> 236.319
really nothing i can do about it

236.64 --> 242.159
but yeah i do know that some of you have

239.36 --> 244.31900000000002
like pj krishan cleary cleary was right

242.159 --> 248.239
on top of it

244.319 --> 249.67999999999998
like he was there the first show

248.239 --> 253.68
and

249.68 --> 256.479
dank as well and good servant

253.68 --> 258.16
but anyway i'm back on youtube

256.479 --> 260.799
after the week

258.16 --> 260.79900000000004
shut down

263.28 --> 271.919
and yeah we'll just keep going

266.84 --> 271.919
and gonna have to be a little careful

274.56 --> 280.32
like what i address how i address it

277.68 --> 281.44
but yeah nothing's really gonna stop the

280.32 --> 284.8
signal

281.44 --> 284.8
henceforth the name

288.24 --> 294.56
you know i wasn't yelling at you

290.8 --> 296.16
yesterday right what

294.56 --> 299.28000000000003
no that don't worry about that good

296.16 --> 302.72
servant i was actually joking about that

299.28 --> 305.59999999999997
it's just that i came right in there

302.72 --> 308.639
and then well technically i could have

305.6 --> 311.199
interpreted like is he talking about me

308.639 --> 314.639
but i didn't think you really were

311.199 --> 316.96000000000004
i think that if you be if you'd be

314.639 --> 318.8
frustrating to a yelling level towards

316.96 --> 322.88
me you would probably still feel

318.8 --> 325.52000000000004
comfortable to directly express that

322.88 --> 327.6
right because at worst i just tell you

325.52 --> 330.08
come on dude you're squirting that's the

327.6 --> 332.96000000000004
worst you could expect you know you know

330.08 --> 332.96
that good servant

334.479 --> 337.59999999999997
but i did catch your live stream

336.08 --> 339.44
yesterday and it was kind of fun being

337.6 --> 342.96000000000004
there in chat for a while until you

339.44 --> 342.96
round it out pretty quickly

346.4 --> 351.52
what did you get what i sent to pavo

349.68 --> 352.96
huh

351.52 --> 355.12
okay

352.96 --> 356.31899999999996
i know i haven't checked that out just

355.12 --> 358.319
yet all

356.319 --> 361.56
i'll check it out

358.319 --> 361.56
thank you

369.039 --> 371.28
ah

371.919 --> 374.79999999999995
yes thank you

373.84 --> 376.71999999999997
that

374.8 --> 379.6
you know

376.72 --> 381.68
might not seem like a like much

379.6 --> 383.199
but when you

381.68 --> 385.52
are broke

383.199 --> 387.68
anything is good enough not that i'm

385.52 --> 389.19899999999996
broke right now but hey i was kind of

387.68 --> 390.40000000000003
like last week

389.199 --> 392.479
till

390.4 --> 394.63899999999995
dank and julio pabin and others helped

392.479 --> 397.28
me out

394.639 --> 399.039
but hey every little bit helps and it's

397.28 --> 400.79999999999995
also

399.039 --> 403.68
well if you do it it's kind of a vote of

400.8 --> 405.44
confidence and that

403.68 --> 407.12
gives me currency

405.44 --> 409.28
of another sort

407.12 --> 412.08
so i really appreciate the support pj

409.28 --> 414.79999999999995
krishan and i really appreciated your

412.08 --> 415.75899999999996
enthusiasm

414.8 --> 418.16
and

415.759 --> 420.40000000000003
also on top of that your ability to

418.16 --> 423.36
actually

420.4 --> 424.71999999999997
well get what i'm saying in many ways

423.36 --> 426.8
right

424.72 --> 428.319
it's not something i take for granted

426.8 --> 430.24
anymore these days

428.319 --> 433.36
lots of people dwelling

430.24 --> 435.84000000000003
and they try but they can't get it so

433.36 --> 438.319
i'm really glad that

435.84 --> 439.28
you're here i really appreciate you as a

438.319 --> 443.03900000000004
follower

439.28 --> 443.039
so thank you for the support as well

445.599 --> 449.24
hello ground control

455.44 --> 457.84
hmm

462.96 --> 465.84
right

466.16 --> 469.12
so yeah uh

471.12 --> 476.72
i'm um

473.84 --> 479.039
you had to make a paypal again was paint

476.72 --> 480.72
right yeah it look yeah if you have

479.039 --> 483.28
never used it

480.72 --> 487.44000000000005
you d it is kind of a hassle to set it

483.28 --> 489.52
up but once it you get you get it going

487.44 --> 491.44
and they don't nag you for political

489.52 --> 493.84
reasons it's actually a really great

491.44 --> 493.84
system

497.919 --> 502.08
but yeah once they start nagging you

499.68 --> 504.72
then it becomes a real real opinion yes

502.08 --> 507.52
but they haven't done that to me so far

504.72 --> 510.0
and i'm really thankful

507.52 --> 512.159
please please don't do that

510.0 --> 513.519
to me thanks

512.159 --> 516.519
right

513.519 --> 516.519
anyway

522.479 --> 528.88
oh yeah by the way it is of course

524.399 --> 531.44
sunday the 15th of august 2021

528.88 --> 534.08
and i'll be doing

531.44 --> 535.6800000000001
an hour stream or probably one and a

534.08 --> 537.6800000000001
half hour

535.68 --> 540.0
like yesterday

537.68 --> 540.959
and yesterday it was a really good

540.0 --> 543.519
stream

540.959 --> 546.7199999999999
and i yeah i had a lot it had a lot of

543.519 --> 548.48
trouble like reloading because i tried

546.72 --> 551.2
to watch it back

548.48 --> 553.12
but i it just didn't work out

551.2 --> 556.48
like it wouldn't load

553.12 --> 558.8
but i am currently in the middle of ah

556.48 --> 562.399
it's finished downloading

558.8 --> 564.399
that's awesome so i have that video

562.399 --> 566.48
on my computer

564.399 --> 568.959
because on the live of course

566.48 --> 572.08
unfortunately because i'm not like

568.959 --> 575.68
paid i don't have a paid account

572.08 --> 579.2
all the replays drop after three days so

575.68 --> 579.1999999999999
yeah these will be like the

579.839 --> 582.8000000000001
this what is it

583.279 --> 587.6
the seven

584.399 --> 587.6
lost episodes

588.399 --> 592.88
because i don't think i'm gonna upload

590.0 --> 595.68
them on on youtube

592.88 --> 597.76
i you know what i might upload them on

595.68 --> 599.5999999999999
our winnie and bear account

597.76 --> 602.0
i think that that would be a little

599.6 --> 602.0
safer

602.72 --> 608.64
right but no hurry for me

605.44 --> 610.48
and i didn't like drop anything like

608.64 --> 612.399
really super

610.48 --> 614.5600000000001
in the moment relevant

612.399 --> 616.839
it's further expansion upon everything

614.56 --> 619.68
that i've done right talking

616.839 --> 622.32
esoterics talking a bit about

619.68 --> 625.1999999999999
yesterday was all about the trinity

622.32 --> 628.24
the age of illusions in the historical

625.2 --> 630.5600000000001
sense it wasn't i named it after that

628.24 --> 630.5600000000001
and

631.519 --> 637.12
right typical things i talk about

634.16 --> 637.12
hey nathan r

637.279 --> 642.64
yeah yeah yeah you pop by and d live as

639.36 --> 646.92
well i saw you there

642.64 --> 646.92
yeah it's good to have you all back

656.72 --> 662.32
what is the latest flat earth news and

659.279 --> 664.8
breakthrough oh right okay well

662.32 --> 666.88
a little technical update ground control

664.8 --> 670.24
latest breakthrough is

666.88 --> 672.16
we have started to truly realize

670.24 --> 675.04
the difference between flat earthers and

672.16 --> 677.36
anti-flat earthers and like

675.04 --> 680.3199999999999
nathan is taking the full initiative to

677.36 --> 680.32
really define it

680.48 --> 684.0
and it's funny because the first time

682.0 --> 687.68
you started to do it i was like no no

684.0 --> 688.64
why don't i call them trenchers right

687.68 --> 690.4799999999999
but

688.64 --> 693.04
yeah

690.48 --> 696.24
eventually i did like

693.04 --> 698.64
get along with it and now it's a thing

696.24 --> 701.12
so that's there and of course

698.64 --> 704.079
the technical realization

701.12 --> 705.839
that almost every

704.079 --> 708.4799999999999
globe conception

705.839 --> 711.519
and related conception and field and

708.48 --> 712.9590000000001
anything in there requires

711.519 --> 717.519
the r

712.959 --> 720.88
the r value the radius value

717.519 --> 722.639
and so that's kind of a new thing right

720.88 --> 725.04
you might have noticed in the flat earth

722.639 --> 726.8
debates

725.04 --> 730.3199999999999
well

726.8 --> 732.0
yeah in the debates from last friday and

730.32 --> 733.2
thursday thursday already played

732.0 --> 736.639
yesterday

733.2 --> 738.48
on the saturday premiere

736.639 --> 742.0
in the housekeeping questions it's just

738.48 --> 744.399
like yeah where's r

742.0 --> 746.8
requires r

744.399 --> 748.72
this housekeeping question requires are

746.8 --> 750.56
that housekeeping question requires are

748.72 --> 752.72
the only housekeeping question that

750.56 --> 754.16
actually doesn't in a direct sense

752.72 --> 755.9200000000001
require r

754.16 --> 758.959
per default

755.92 --> 761.4399999999999
is gas pressure without a container

758.959 --> 765.279
but as soon as you would draw in the

761.44 --> 766.0790000000001
word atmosphere into such a argument

765.279 --> 769.519
then

766.079 --> 773.16
immediately r is required again

769.519 --> 773.16
so that's a thing

776.8 --> 783.12
yeah got r

779.519 --> 785.44
they don't they don't have it

783.12 --> 788.0
and if they try to conjure it

785.44 --> 789.12
using the horizon as a geometric earth

788.0 --> 791.6
curve

789.12 --> 795.92
invoking terrestrial refraction then

791.6 --> 799.0400000000001
they immediately run into a ditch

795.92 --> 801.12
because of the paradox

799.04 --> 804.399
like you can't get

801.12 --> 806.32
our value from the horizon if it is

804.399 --> 808.0
refracted

806.32 --> 810.32
through terrestrial refraction when

808.0 --> 813.36
terrestrial refraction

810.32 --> 814.72
presupposes r

813.36 --> 817.44
within the

814.72 --> 820.24
the mathematical formula within this

817.44 --> 822.1600000000001
within its system within its machination

820.24 --> 824.32
terrestrial refraction is imagination

822.16 --> 826.639
and it demands r it

824.32 --> 829.7600000000001
you need to know the r value in order to

826.639 --> 832.8
correct for

829.76 --> 836.079
well it being so flat

832.8 --> 837.519
so if you resort to

836.079 --> 841.279
using

837.519 --> 843.12
the horizon to determine r

841.279 --> 845.76
yet it's not there in the place

843.12 --> 847.76
according to normal geometry so you

845.76 --> 849.92
invoke terrestrial refraction well if

847.76 --> 854.079
you do that you immediately run into a

849.92 --> 854.079
paradox dead halt deadlock

855.12 --> 859.04
so they have no r

856.72 --> 863.6
they have no radius value they they

859.04 --> 866.48
cannot get it from anything see

863.6 --> 869.1990000000001
you can think it's there they can assume

866.48 --> 871.36
it's there but there is nothing to get

869.199 --> 875.12
it from really

871.36 --> 875.12
that's the their main issue

875.519 --> 879.199
and originally

877.36 --> 881.44
it was just assumed like yeah you get it

879.199 --> 882.4799999999999
from horizon

881.44 --> 884.9590000000001
really

882.48 --> 887.279
and from the sun angles

884.959 --> 889.76
in combination

887.279 --> 892.24
but yeah that doesn't really work out

889.76 --> 892.24
anymore

892.48 --> 896.8000000000001
because the black swan basically undoes

894.8 --> 898.56
that simple assertion that you can

896.8 --> 900.7199999999999
derive

898.56 --> 902.079
the radius value of the earth from the

900.72 --> 904.0
horizon

902.079 --> 906.079
and when that is

904.0 --> 908.24
figured out then there's no other

906.079 --> 910.56
alternative to get

908.24 --> 913.519
the r value

910.56 --> 914.88
because the celestial lights

913.519 --> 916.5600000000001
yeah

914.88 --> 919.12
they're so there's too many

916.56 --> 922.0
uncertainties about what they even are

919.12 --> 923.92
and the exact distance etc there's too

922.0 --> 927.44
many issues

923.92 --> 928.56
so without presupposing a radius value

927.44 --> 931.0400000000001
for earth

928.56 --> 932.0
you can't even really use the celestial

931.04 --> 934.959
lights

932.0 --> 938.32
to derive the radius

934.959 --> 942.4799999999999
like to really get that value

938.32 --> 942.48
and trust me as balwin i've tried

942.72 --> 948.8000000000001
so i can basically engage in a in a in a

946.079 --> 952.16
simulatory process

948.8 --> 954.7199999999999
of trying to derive a radius value

952.16 --> 955.68
based on the equator

954.72 --> 958.1600000000001
line

955.68 --> 960.16
which is a derivative it's a derived

958.16 --> 963.199
convention based on celestial light

960.16 --> 967.279
orientations on the earth

963.199 --> 969.519
but yeah as soon as i then suggest

967.279 --> 972.56
that that means it's a sphere i

969.519 --> 975.04
immediately engage in a fallacy

972.56 --> 976.399
so yeah i've been trying to set up like

975.04 --> 979.04
a trick

976.399 --> 981.279
a baller trick it is a magician's trick

979.04 --> 983.279
as as a baller as ballwin

981.279 --> 985.759
to basically just say like no you can do

983.279 --> 988.24
this and then you have this

985.759 --> 989.04
this distance

988.24 --> 991.839
right

989.04 --> 994.24
so what can you conclude from this

991.839 --> 995.9200000000001
distance and then leave it open to the

994.24 --> 998.399
interpreter so i don't have to

995.92 --> 999.8389999999999
presuppose i would just leave that to

998.399 --> 1002.16
whoever is

999.839 --> 1004.1600000000001
considering it

1002.16 --> 1006.24
it's kind of a sneaky trick

1004.16 --> 1007.199
and nathan did not buy it at all of

1006.24 --> 1009.519
course

1007.199 --> 1012.079
neither did the others

1009.519 --> 1012.079
but hey

1013.04 --> 1016.24
what else can you do

1020.56 --> 1025.6
hello will gaston

1023.12 --> 1027.919
yeah by the way guys i did get a whole

1025.6 --> 1029.76
bunch of subscribers

1027.919 --> 1032.16
in the last week i've gotten more

1029.76 --> 1034.559
subscribers while not live streaming

1032.16 --> 1038.76
than i had all year

1034.559 --> 1038.76
isn't that just special

1039.6 --> 1042.0
really

1042.24 --> 1049.079
i have

1044.199 --> 1049.0790000000002
1987 subscribers now

1054.799 --> 1060.0
so thank you everybody for subscribing

1056.88 --> 1062.3200000000002
who has subscribed recently

1060.0 --> 1065.039
and yeah welcome to the flat earth early

1062.32 --> 1067.039
bird show please share the show further

1065.039 --> 1069.76
i'd like to get to those

1067.039 --> 1073.76
2 000 only 13 more subscribers and i'm

1069.76 --> 1075.919
there and well if the if the grow rate

1073.76 --> 1078.84
of the last week keeps up i will

1075.919 --> 1082.4
definitely get there like as in next

1078.84 --> 1083.6
week maybe maybe even quicker maybe at

1082.4 --> 1085.44
the

1083.6 --> 1087.84
at the end of today

1085.44 --> 1087.8400000000001
we'll see

1093.44 --> 1099.0
what

1095.039 --> 1099.0
what are you talking about rubbish

1115.12 --> 1118.2399999999998
all right

1116.32 --> 1120.48
yeah by the way i think i'm just going

1118.24 --> 1122.96
to give you a ranch rubbish you've

1120.48 --> 1126.84
you've been around for a while

1122.96 --> 1126.8400000000001
you even email me

1137.919 --> 1142.88
maybe i'm in youtube jail

1141.039 --> 1146.32
the algorithm doesn't trigger which

1142.88 --> 1146.3200000000002
keeps you from getting subs

1147.36 --> 1150.799
that is

1148.64 --> 1152.48
that is kind of what i was thinking too

1150.799 --> 1153.44
dank that's really

1152.48 --> 1155.2
yeah

1153.44 --> 1157.1200000000001
because i don't understand like how

1155.2 --> 1159.1200000000001
suddenly the subscribers went up at a

1157.12 --> 1161.1999999999998
steady rate instead of just

1159.12 --> 1162.84
back and forth back and forth like it

1161.2 --> 1166.559
has been all

1162.84 --> 1166.559
year it's weird

1166.88 --> 1173.8400000000001
so yeah the only way to get subscribers

1170.0 --> 1175.76
quickly is if i manage to get a strike

1173.84 --> 1178.8799999999999
yay

1175.76 --> 1181.6
unfortunately though there is a distinct

1178.88 --> 1184.3200000000002
limit about limited amount of strikes i

1181.6 --> 1184.32
can get so

1186.08 --> 1191.559
yeah no i'm not gonna try to get another

1188.0 --> 1191.559
one thanks

1193.12 --> 1199.1999999999998
he's on about my lemons from their life

1196.96 --> 1199.2
what

1199.919 --> 1203.2800000000002
oh oh right yeah you did get some of

1202.4 --> 1206.52
those

1203.28 --> 1206.52
didn't you

1208.24 --> 1211.36
yeah i'm sorry man

1211.84 --> 1216.559
i did cut like you did tell me you were

1214.24 --> 1218.84
gonna do that in the chat

1216.559 --> 1221.9189999999999
and i did tell you like yeah maybe

1218.84 --> 1224.08
that's you don't necessarily need to do

1221.919 --> 1224.0800000000002
that

1224.799 --> 1228.8799999999999
but hey yeah there's more streams on d

1226.88 --> 1231.7600000000002
live and yeah you can technically just

1228.88 --> 1231.7600000000002
drop lemons

1231.919 --> 1236.4
at other places too so i do that too

1240.48 --> 1244.24
oh okay rob h

1242.4 --> 1248.2
is okay

1244.24 --> 1248.2
i'll take it away again

1253.44 --> 1256.0800000000002
that's fine

1257.6 --> 1264.6399999999999
hey plunder 23 welcome to chat

1260.559 --> 1264.6399999999999
22 watching not bad

1266.4 --> 1272.64
yeah with d live in my last stream my

1269.12 --> 1276.12
man what was the amount

1272.64 --> 1276.1200000000001
i got like

1276.4 --> 1282.0800000000002
15 live viewers

1279.12 --> 1286.1999999999998
at the highest point

1282.08 --> 1286.1999999999998
and that's just after a week

1296.24 --> 1300.48
what's the topic well

1298.24 --> 1303.039
whatever you want it to be

1300.48 --> 1305.6
right i guess that the main topic is i'm

1303.039 --> 1308.0
back on youtube

1305.6 --> 1308.0
today

1309.76 --> 1312.96
and

1310.96 --> 1314.88
oh yeah another thing

1312.96 --> 1316.72
right you might have missed that if you

1314.88 --> 1319.44
look in the description box of the

1316.72 --> 1322.72
youtube video you might notice that my

1319.44 --> 1323.679
skype address is different because

1322.72 --> 1326.32
yeah

1323.679 --> 1329.2
it got

1326.32 --> 1331.6
it yeah it it got blocked

1329.2 --> 1334.72
for no apparent reason

1331.6 --> 1336.9599999999998
i just couldn't it just like refused to

1334.72 --> 1338.72
lock me in again

1336.96 --> 1341.3600000000001
and then i tried to like get the

1338.72 --> 1343.28
password back and yeah it was tied into

1341.36 --> 1345.52
an email address

1343.28 --> 1348.799
that that literally doesn't exist

1345.52 --> 1351.12
anymore is not retrievable and it just i

1348.799 --> 1352.96
tried to get some desk help

1351.12 --> 1355.6
help desk

1352.96 --> 1358.24
it just didn't work so it's gone

1355.6 --> 1361.039
but i have made up this new account tied

1358.24 --> 1364.32
into my regular email so

1361.039 --> 1366.4
that should not pose a problem

1364.32 --> 1368.559
the same problem anymore if

1366.4 --> 1370.96
something similar happens

1368.559 --> 1373.6789999999999
and i just reconnect it up i'm back in

1370.96 --> 1376.799
my early birth chat and skype and

1373.679 --> 1376.799
the ball busters and

1377.36 --> 1379.84
all that

1380.0 --> 1383.84
but yeah

1381.44 --> 1387.76
if you previously

1383.84 --> 1389.84
sought out to contact me on skype

1387.76 --> 1391.6
i recommend you

1389.84 --> 1392.799
do it again

1391.6 --> 1395.4399999999998
because i

1392.799 --> 1399.08
i don't see yeah i can't log in on the

1395.44 --> 1399.0800000000002
other account anymore

1405.52 --> 1410.48
okay david games

1408.24 --> 1410.48
uh

1411.84 --> 1413.9189999999999
i

1412.799 --> 1416.799
i don't

1413.919 --> 1417.76
really care too much about that yeah

1416.799 --> 1421.6
that's

1417.76 --> 1421.6
exoterics like what's the point

1422.24 --> 1426.64
how yeah how does that thing

1425.76 --> 1428.32
make

1426.64 --> 1431.8400000000001
what jesus said

1428.32 --> 1431.84
legitimate or illegitimate

1437.919 --> 1440.919
right

1451.6 --> 1456.52
so yeah that that's about it

1460.96 --> 1463.279
right

1463.6 --> 1468.6399999999999
like a lot of legends have been made up

1466.08 --> 1469.6
about this individual a lot of them and

1468.64 --> 1472.5590000000002
hey

1469.6 --> 1475.84
not surprising you know since he was in

1472.559 --> 1477.84
a very old prophecy

1475.84 --> 1480.32
was in there so yeah then it's not

1477.84 --> 1482.72
surprising that afterward endless amount

1480.32 --> 1486.6789999999999
of crazy legends would be made up about

1482.72 --> 1486.679
this man by priests

1488.4 --> 1492.0
that

1489.2 --> 1492.799
well put him on a pedestal and worship

1492.0 --> 1495.76
him

1492.799 --> 1498.0
literally as if he is god

1495.76 --> 1498.0
right

1499.279 --> 1504.559
that thing that jesus kind of advised

1502.159 --> 1504.5590000000002
against

1510.799 --> 1515.679
do i accept

1513.6 --> 1517.6789999999999
what about it

1515.679 --> 1519.44
what do i need why would i need to

1517.679 --> 1522.3200000000002
accept that

1519.44 --> 1524.96
i wasn't there dude

1522.32 --> 1527.12
do i think it's true

1524.96 --> 1527.1200000000001
uh

1527.44 --> 1535.679
let's just say i cannot exclude it

1531.36 --> 1538.1589999999999
but i don't think it needs to be true

1535.679 --> 1538.159
at all

1540.24 --> 1545.039
that's what i think about it but i'm not

1542.64 --> 1547.3600000000001
excluding that it might have been like

1545.039 --> 1547.36
that

1554.08 --> 1558.1589999999999
what is in sex is bad lip

1564.72 --> 1569.44
well

1565.6 --> 1571.52
look that that idea oh sex is bad like i

1569.44 --> 1574.88
don't see how you would

1571.52 --> 1574.8799999999999
get anything out of that

1575.2 --> 1578.32
it's just ridiculous

1580.559 --> 1584.2
hey the big m

1584.48 --> 1587.44
it's good to be back

1591.12 --> 1597.12
okay well david came in that case i

1594.08 --> 1600.24
absolutely and utterly rejected

1597.12 --> 1603.6
because i think that the trinity the

1600.24 --> 1607.039
the trinity within christianity

1603.6 --> 1608.3999999999999
is actually a

1607.039 --> 1610.799
well

1608.4 --> 1613.6000000000001
a satanic piece of wizardry it's a it's

1610.799 --> 1616.0
a mind puzzle to trap and enthrall

1613.6 --> 1618.32
people and actually draw them away from

1616.0 --> 1621.039
christ's teachings

1618.32 --> 1623.84
yeah that's what i think about it

1621.039 --> 1626.72
so if it is intricately tied into that

1623.84 --> 1629.12
nonsense you must believe this or

1626.72 --> 1631.039
well then [ __ ] off

1629.12 --> 1633.6
because all those people are a bunch of

1631.039 --> 1636.64
satanic scumbags

1633.6 --> 1639.4399999999998
literally devil persecuting

1636.64 --> 1640.48
scumbags that are literally seeking out

1639.44 --> 1643.1200000000001
in the world

1640.48 --> 1645.919
for contract breakers

1643.12 --> 1647.76
they think it's a contract and you must

1645.919 --> 1650.3990000000001
sign the contract and if you break the

1647.76 --> 1652.8799999999999
contract you go to hell that's all

1650.399 --> 1656.08
wizardry [ __ ]

1652.88 --> 1657.679
people like that are possessed by the

1656.08 --> 1659.9189999999999
devil

1657.679 --> 1662.48
and they don't even know it because they

1659.919 --> 1663.679
think they're opposing him

1662.48 --> 1665.679
right

1663.679 --> 1668.159
you know them by their fruits by their

1665.679 --> 1670.0800000000002
actions

1668.159 --> 1672.0800000000002
that's the real result

1670.08 --> 1673.76
that's the thing that proves

1672.08 --> 1677.24
what you do

1673.76 --> 1677.24
what it is

1686.0 --> 1692.72
ah so hope you got your answer yeah i

1688.72 --> 1696.559
utterly reject it i reject the trinity

1692.72 --> 1698.96
and i especially reject people

1696.559 --> 1700.08
that think

1698.96 --> 1703.6000000000001
that

1700.08 --> 1706.6399999999999
believing a riddle that doesn't make any

1703.6 --> 1709.52
bloody [ __ ] sense in any form it

1706.64 --> 1710.3990000000001
doesn't make logical mechanical sense it

1709.52 --> 1714.6399999999999
doesn't

1710.399 --> 1715.76
abide by god standards for creation at

1714.64 --> 1717.6000000000001
all

1715.76 --> 1722.1589999999999
and if you believe that that is

1717.6 --> 1724.559
necessary essential or you are the enemy

1722.159 --> 1727.5200000000002
well then you are the enemy

1724.559 --> 1732.559
you're your own enemy you literally got

1727.52 --> 1735.279
tricked into a fair pharisaic contract

1732.559 --> 1739.799
that's what you do

1735.279 --> 1739.799
by doing that you understand

1753.52 --> 1757.12
you know every time somebody brings up

1755.52 --> 1760.399
that [ __ ]

1757.12 --> 1760.399
i i would always just say

1761.039 --> 1765.12
why don't you ask jesus about it

1765.279 --> 1770.399
and not some representative not some

1767.76 --> 1773.12
chanting priest

1770.399 --> 1774.399
that has their mind made up railroaded

1773.12 --> 1777.12
in that chant

1774.399 --> 1780.7199999999998
but why don't you actually look through

1777.12 --> 1782.8799999999999
jesus's words and see if you can find

1780.72 --> 1786.799
his response

1782.88 --> 1788.72
to these beliefs and these actions

1786.799 --> 1791.9189999999999
because i'm pretty sure that he did

1788.72 --> 1791.919
actually address that

1792.64 --> 1796.88
but i think he called them pharisees

1806.84 --> 1811.12
oh

1808.799 --> 1812.55
ooh adam meekin has a new thumbnail for

1811.12 --> 1815.78
me

1812.55 --> 1815.78
[Applause]

1840.98 --> 1844.119
[Applause]

1846.38 --> 1851.0400000000002
[Applause]

1867.58 --> 1873.119
[Applause]

1878.42 --> 1893.8490000000002
[Applause]

1895.679 --> 1901.76
right yeah animaking made a nice

1899.039 --> 1901.76
thumbnail

1903.84 --> 1909.6
i'm asking him to modify it so yeah i

1906.24 --> 1909.6
will upload that later

1913.519 --> 1918.36
oh god here we go again

1922.72 --> 1926.88
well david keynes you don't

1928.24 --> 1935.1200000000001
the deity of you know that that's

1930.88 --> 1937.1200000000001
actually advised against to declare

1935.12 --> 1939.9189999999999
people deity

1937.12 --> 1941.6789999999999
like the entire works

1939.919 --> 1945.279
is riddled

1941.679 --> 1946.24
with the dangers of of worshiping an

1945.279 --> 1947.2
idol

1946.24 --> 1949.84
right

1947.2 --> 1949.8400000000001
any idol

1951.44 --> 1955.3600000000001
oh

1952.159 --> 1957.679
they gave a specific exception for this

1955.36 --> 1960.9599999999998
one individual did they

1957.679 --> 1963.2
or was it just universal

1960.96 --> 1966.72
right

1963.2 --> 1968.559
drawing away from the creator outside of

1966.72 --> 1970.48
all space and time

1968.559 --> 1974.6399999999999
the great designer

1970.48 --> 1974.64
the bringer of all information

1975.519 --> 1980.72
and then draw your attention away from

1977.84 --> 1984.399
that towards a singular individual which

1980.72 --> 1987.519
you are gonna ascribe absolute power

1984.399 --> 1990.799
right or when you do that you literally

1987.519 --> 1992.799
lose your understanding

1990.799 --> 1996.8799999999999
it's worshipping idols it's highly

1992.799 --> 1999.12
advised against by christ as well

1996.88 --> 1999.1200000000001
right

2000.08 --> 2004.559
king james was not a king yeah he was a

2002.32 --> 2008.1589999999999
he was a transvestite

2004.559 --> 2008.1589999999999

what are you talking about the big m

2207.599 --> 2211.4
door the excellent one

2214.24 --> 2218.7999999999997
i heard many wild stories

2217.52 --> 2221.44
move to you

2218.8 --> 2224.079
wow so they made like this entire

2221.44 --> 2226.0
library of [ __ ]

2224.079 --> 2228.88
of things i'd supposedly done in this

2226.0 --> 2231.68
last i'm not surprised dude i i really

2228.88 --> 2234.0
trigger their imaginations i really

2231.68 --> 2237.0
really do but then again there's not

2234.0 --> 2240.839
that many people that just blatantly and

2237.0 --> 2244.0
unapologetically on camera declare i'm a

2240.839 --> 2246.4
wizard i've seen through time

2244.0 --> 2247.92
yeah and i can fizz like i can literally

2246.4 --> 2250.88
back that

2247.92 --> 2253.52
i have several memories and that just

2250.88 --> 2255.28
triggers some people to such an extent

2253.52 --> 2259.52
where they just

2255.28 --> 2259.52
can't stop staring and like wow

2260.96 --> 2265.52
is that for real

2263.359 --> 2267.52
and then other people just like to make

2265.52 --> 2268.839
up [ __ ] stories did

2267.52 --> 2272.56
it's like their

2268.839 --> 2275.119
own arwyn inspired science fiction

2272.56 --> 2275.119
stories

2277.599 --> 2282.88
and apparently yeah those

2280.16 --> 2284.8799999999997
like micro science fiction adventures of

2282.88 --> 2287.839
irwin's life that people make up are

2284.88 --> 2289.92
very inspiring to a whole lot of people

2287.839 --> 2292.7999999999997
i guess i've created a whole new

2289.92 --> 2292.8
subculture

2294.56 --> 2298.16
that's all fine

2296.16 --> 2300.16
i'm not even going after the videos

2298.16 --> 2301.7599999999998
anymore

2300.16 --> 2302.56
like i'm not

2301.76 --> 2305.599
let

2302.56 --> 2305.599
let them squirt

2307.04 --> 2311.52
let them clip together the craziest [ __ ]

2309.2 --> 2314.0
you can imagine like they've been doing

2311.52 --> 2316.56
that forever and they will

2314.0 --> 2318.72
be doing it even more

2316.56 --> 2320.32
the funny thing is though that no matter

2318.72 --> 2322.64
how

2320.32 --> 2325.28
terrible they get no matter how

2322.64 --> 2328.8799999999997
much they put out that garbage

2325.28 --> 2329.92
it's not gonna stop me i'm only gonna

2328.88 --> 2331.359
become

2329.92 --> 2332.88
better

2331.359 --> 2334.48
more confident

2332.88 --> 2337.359
more energetic

2334.48 --> 2339.76
and have more grip on the world you

2337.359 --> 2342.88
cannot and do that ballers

2339.76 --> 2345.0400000000004
and anti-flat earthers

2342.88 --> 2346.7200000000003
you cannot undo that

2345.04 --> 2350.48
you cannot stop

2346.72 --> 2353.68
my ascension you really really can't

2350.48 --> 2355.52
this thing has been set to happen a long

2353.68 --> 2357.68
time ago yeah

2355.52 --> 2359.92
yeah what if i told you

2357.68 --> 2362.0789999999997
what if i let let's just

2359.92 --> 2364.16
let's just tighten up that tension a

2362.079 --> 2367.04
little bit more so you can score it even

2364.16 --> 2368.8799999999997
harder over it yeah what if i told you

2367.04 --> 2371.68
yeah

2368.88 --> 2374.6400000000003
that around 25

2371.68 --> 2378.72
to 20 years ago

2374.64 --> 2379.92
people knew i was gonna do this

2378.72 --> 2382.9599999999996
ah

2379.92 --> 2385.6800000000003
yeah i know that's really freaky when i

2382.96 --> 2388.48
didn't even i wasn't even awakened yet

2385.68 --> 2391.2799999999997
people tried to stop me

2388.48 --> 2392.96
when i wasn't even awoken yet

2391.28 --> 2396.96
yeah

2392.96 --> 2400.88
that's how serious this process is i try

2396.96 --> 2403.28
to through the dark world try to

2400.88 --> 2406.319
become this

2403.28 --> 2409.119
step into this process because i wanted

2406.319 --> 2411.44
it i wanted it 20 years ago i wanted it

2409.119 --> 2414.2400000000002
now i want this

2411.44 --> 2416.48
this is what i am i wanted it i wanted

2414.24 --> 2418.8799999999997
the ascension right now i wanted to get

2416.48 --> 2420.96
over the things that i couldn't get over

2418.88 --> 2423.599
i wanted the wisdom in the future i

2420.96 --> 2425.839
wanted it now now now now now and i

2423.599 --> 2425.839
couldn't

2426.16 --> 2430.48
and other people

2427.92 --> 2431.6800000000003
apparently through some mystical reason

2430.48 --> 2434.0
knew

2431.68 --> 2437.68
what i was going to become

2434.0 --> 2437.68
they knew i was going to awaken

2437.76 --> 2443.28
they actually i have absolutely

2440.8 --> 2447.599
absolutely no evidence for this but they

2443.28 --> 2449.3590000000004
suggested that i actually help build

2447.599 --> 2452.96
a whole bunch of

2449.359 --> 2455.52
spiritual infrastructure

2452.96 --> 2457.76
oh guess what i've been doing

2455.52 --> 2457.7599999999998
yeah

2457.839 --> 2462.16
for some reason they knew

2459.76 --> 2463.599
whatever they were were they spirits on

2462.16 --> 2466.16
the other side

2463.599 --> 2467.92
in the dark world vision

2466.16 --> 2470.7999999999997
i don't know

2467.92 --> 2473.04
it was quite mystical

2470.8 --> 2475.8390000000004
and unnerving

2473.04 --> 2477.44
because i was scared like

2475.839 --> 2480.7999999999997
look at look at

2477.44 --> 2483.44
it like this and this is highly internal

2480.8 --> 2485.2000000000003
right this is psychological

2483.44 --> 2487.92
at the time when i was confronted like

2485.2 --> 2490.72
you are gonna become this

2487.92 --> 2493.44
i was afraid they were gonna kill me

2490.72 --> 2496.24
for it when i wasn't

2493.44 --> 2498.16
grown yet when i wasn't there yet

2496.24 --> 2499.839
because they somehow knew that i was

2498.16 --> 2501.92
gonna get there i was afraid they were

2499.839 --> 2503.359
gonna kill me before i would manage to

2501.92 --> 2505.52
bloom

2503.359 --> 2506.56
right that's what i was afraid of back

2505.52 --> 2509.599
then

2506.56 --> 2512.88
that is an excruciating terror that very

2509.599 --> 2512.88
few people can imagine

2514.48 --> 2519.44
but i was wrong

2517.04 --> 2525.119
because the only thing they ever tried

2519.44 --> 2527.52
to do was just trick me away from it

2525.119 --> 2530.079
and the weird thing is they have

2527.52 --> 2532.24
attempted to like really

2530.079 --> 2536.2400000000002
traumatize me

2532.24 --> 2538.7999999999997
actively knowingly traumatize me

2536.24 --> 2542.24
and when they tried

2538.8 --> 2544.6400000000003
i would already know the things that i

2542.24 --> 2546.319
needed to know in order to not get

2544.64 --> 2548.96
caught by the spell even though i didn't

2546.319 --> 2552.16
consciously know it

2548.96 --> 2554.56
yeah i was still in the belief of

2552.16 --> 2557.04
society works the way it does i still

2554.56 --> 2561.359
actually believe that vaccines were half

2557.04 --> 2564.24
way legitimate like 20 years ago

2561.359 --> 2566.64
but when they would literally crouch up

2564.24 --> 2568.8799999999997
on me and be like

2566.64 --> 2570.96
you have to do this

2568.88 --> 2573.92
i would know

2570.96 --> 2575.92
things that i couldn't know

2573.92 --> 2577.119
and i think that terrified the [ __ ] out

2575.92 --> 2578.88
of people

2577.119 --> 2581.04
because i knew things that i couldn't

2578.88 --> 2584.56
know that i could not draw from my

2581.04 --> 2587.839
conscious mind i knew it i knew

2584.56 --> 2590.0789999999997
how it was wrong why i shouldn't take it

2587.839 --> 2592.72
and why i shouldn't be worried even

2590.079 --> 2595.52
though i had no conscious grip over it

2592.72 --> 2600.24
because i think at the time

2595.52 --> 2600.24
i somehow grabbed it out of the future

2602.16 --> 2606.7999999999997
so yeah there's something for the squirt

2604.96 --> 2610.0
boys out there

2606.8 --> 2610.0
to squirt over some more

2621.119 --> 2624.6400000000003
dude

2622.4 --> 2627.2000000000003
knowing things you can't consciously

2624.64 --> 2630.64
know is really quite a kick when you

2627.2 --> 2630.64
realize that's going on

2632.72 --> 2636.7999999999997
hey melby styles good to see you

2643.119 --> 2645.359
right

2645.599 --> 2650.8
you know what i was tortured with in my

2648.0 --> 2653.44
visions 20 years ago

2650.8 --> 2653.44
vaccines

2654.48 --> 2657.839
they suggested i had no choice but to

2656.64 --> 2660.7999999999997
take it

2657.839 --> 2663.68
because otherwise i would die

2660.8 --> 2666.88
right but they didn't tell me that it

2663.68 --> 2669.839
was actually metaphorical

2666.88 --> 2672.8
so i struggled in anguish within my

2669.839 --> 2675.839
visions for a very long time

2672.8 --> 2677.92
with a twisted idea a reversed world

2675.839 --> 2680.56
impression

2677.92 --> 2683.76
that i had to spiritually sweat out for

2680.56 --> 2683.7599999999998
like 20 years

2686.079 --> 2691.52
and now i realize

2688.48 --> 2693.359
how these the demons i guess from the

2691.52 --> 2697.839
other side

2693.359 --> 2697.839
used the scenario to try to

2698.8 --> 2702.5600000000004
it's like

2700.319 --> 2704.56
they knew that upon real world

2702.56 --> 2707.44
confrontation in the time that i would

2704.56 --> 2710.0
be grown older and wiser when confronted

2707.44 --> 2712.96
with it i would absolutely not

2710.0 --> 2714.72
fall for it any chance zero chance that

2712.96 --> 2715.839
i would ever fall for it and i haven't

2714.72 --> 2717.2799999999997
right

2715.839 --> 2719.599
they thought

2717.28 --> 2723.28
they could basically indoctrinate me

2719.599 --> 2725.599
through nightmares and misunderstandings

2723.28 --> 2728.7200000000003
to kind of

2725.599 --> 2730.88
compulsively trig like an mk ultra

2728.72 --> 2733.7599999999998
trigger effect that would make me

2730.88 --> 2735.28
subconsciously take this [ __ ]

2733.76 --> 2737.76
out of some kind of

2735.28 --> 2740.1600000000003
fair insanity spell

2737.76 --> 2742.5600000000004
and it didn't work

2740.16 --> 2743.7599999999998
but it was extremely torturous to go

2742.56 --> 2744.839
through that

2743.76 --> 2748.2400000000002
in my

2744.839 --> 2750.72
visions like the echoes of that still

2748.24 --> 2750.72
haunt me

2752.4 --> 2755.4
right

2764.4 --> 2767.52
20 years ago people

2768.0 --> 2772.48
neo-feudalism

2770.319 --> 2775.119
like and these vision experiences is

2772.48 --> 2776.4
also what kind of like tied me very

2775.119 --> 2779.119
tightly

2776.4 --> 2781.839
to alex jones's

2779.119 --> 2784.0
processes like the the papers he

2781.839 --> 2787.2799999999997
read into

2784.0 --> 2788.48
and brought forth very early

2787.28 --> 2791.44
all these

2788.48 --> 2791.44
these blueprints

2791.76 --> 2794.1600000000003
because

2796.16 --> 2802.24
i already knew it was gonna happen i had

2798.8 --> 2805.76
already seen it i through my visions

2802.24 --> 2805.7599999999998
already been through it

2806.0 --> 2810.48
it was just so torturous at the time

2808.16 --> 2814.92
that i wasn't even willing

2810.48 --> 2814.92
to consciously confront it

2818.079 --> 2823.119
when did i wake up

2820.72 --> 2827.04
when i was born

2823.119 --> 2830.319
literally my my mother used to tell me

2827.04 --> 2832.24
my dad can still testify to this that as

2830.319 --> 2834.079
soon as i was born

2832.24 --> 2835.7599999999998
first thing that happened and like as

2834.079 --> 2838.4
soon as i came out

2835.76 --> 2842.079
first thing that happened was

2838.4 --> 2847.28
neck up eyes wide open like this

2842.079 --> 2847.28
staring my mother straight into the eyes

2848.72 --> 2854.4399999999996
and like

2850.88 --> 2854.44
i have arrived

2858.559 --> 2864.0
i didn't say that by the way but i think

2861.2 --> 2866.16
i like psionically said that because

2864.0 --> 2867.92
yeah this wouldn't be surprising to

2866.16 --> 2870.24
anybody that i was like sort of

2867.92 --> 2873.04
telepathic with my mother

2870.24 --> 2877.52
i think that more people have such

2873.04 --> 2877.52
connections than is taken for granted

2881.44 --> 2883.839
anyway

2884.24 --> 2889.4399999999996
so when did i wake up well as soon as i

2886.72 --> 2889.4399999999996
was born but

2892.319 --> 2900.52
like i always knew it was all there

2895.599 --> 2900.52
i just couldn't handle it right

2900.8 --> 2905.52
the first awakening really is when you

2903.119 --> 2907.92
are first confronted in one way or

2905.52 --> 2910.64
another through dreams through future

2907.92 --> 2913.04
visions through somebody telling you

2910.64 --> 2916.0
through reading a paper that's the first

2913.04 --> 2917.68
awakening but then you still have to

2916.0 --> 2920.16
deal

2917.68 --> 2922.24
with it

2920.16 --> 2924.24
and when you actually get through this

2922.24 --> 2926.0
and you can think you have gotten

2924.24 --> 2928.0789999999997
through this but

2926.0 --> 2930.0
you yeah you can think about it whatever

2928.079 --> 2932.4
you want when you get through it you

2930.0 --> 2934.079
know everybody knows

2932.4 --> 2936.48
especially those that have already

2934.079 --> 2939.119
preceded you in it

2936.48 --> 2941.04
and that's the second awakening when you

2939.119 --> 2942.8
have awakened to it first

2941.04 --> 2944.72
see confront it for the first time then

2942.8 --> 2948.559
the second awakening when you're

2944.72 --> 2950.8799999999997
actually able to accept it

2948.559 --> 2952.8
and deal with it

2950.88 --> 2955.359
in the in the moment

2952.8 --> 2957.28
doing things with it building with it

2955.359 --> 2958.96
building with how things turned out to

2957.28 --> 2961.119
be

2958.96 --> 2963.92
that's a second awakening

2961.119 --> 2965.76
and my first awakening in in a sense was

2963.92 --> 2968.8
literally at birth

2965.76 --> 2968.8
through the other realm

2968.839 --> 2975.839
but it's taken me half a lifetime to be

2972.16 --> 2975.839
able to learn to deal with it

2977.2 --> 2982.96
it's very depressing really in a way

2980.24 --> 2985.7599999999998
but then again i was always able to

2982.96 --> 2986.88
distract myself with fantasy

2985.76 --> 2989.44
and just

2986.88 --> 2991.44
a lot of high sensory which really does

2989.44 --> 2994.16
make life more enjoyable

2991.44 --> 2996.079
to just witness the beauty of nature and

2994.16 --> 2997.68
creation

2996.079 --> 3002.119
that was always the

2997.68 --> 3002.1189999999997
consolidation against it

3012.319 --> 3016.68
hey amanda young good to see you

3257.68 --> 3260.319
welcome back

3262.079 --> 3265.8390000000004
george sandford long time

3284.319 --> 3290.72
the resurrection and doubts well

3287.52 --> 3293.04
that's all very cute

3290.72 --> 3294.48
i don't care

3293.04 --> 3296.48
right

3294.48 --> 3298.079
i'm gonna pay attention to what jesus

3296.48 --> 3301.52
said

3298.079 --> 3304.7200000000003
and yeah paul

3301.52 --> 3304.72
i don't trust that guy

3304.88 --> 3310.2400000000002
he tried to make his own thing

3307.68 --> 3313.2799999999997
right he i think that paul

3310.24 --> 3314.72
was actually one of the first ones

3313.28 --> 3317.6800000000003
that tried to

3314.72 --> 3321.2799999999997
in opposition to what christ recommended

3317.68 --> 3324.8799999999997
make a church out of his legacy

3321.28 --> 3326.88
instead of be making it a personal

3324.88 --> 3329.28
spiritual tradition

3326.88 --> 3331.52
which jesus really wanted it to be for

3329.28 --> 3335.119
each individual without a priesthood

3331.52 --> 3336.16
without some deity representative

3335.119 --> 3338.48
to

3336.16 --> 3341.92
create that personal connection with god

3338.48 --> 3345.04
that is what jesus said yeah paul went

3341.92 --> 3347.359
against that crap

3345.04 --> 3347.359
yeah

3347.44 --> 3350.16
so yeah

3351.119 --> 3355.6800000000003
how about you actually listen to what

3354.079 --> 3358.319
jesus said

3355.68 --> 3360.839
instead of re reserve

3358.319 --> 3363.68
reverting back to other

3360.839 --> 3366.799
people huh

3363.68 --> 3366.799
ever considered that

3374.4 --> 3377.4
ah

3379.24 --> 3382.3199999999997
[Music]

3388.559 --> 3393.599
but you don't do you

3390.559 --> 3397.2000000000003
you just try to follow

3393.599 --> 3397.2000000000003
the step by step

3397.839 --> 3402.599
esoteric spell

3400.079 --> 3405.28
you don't actually inquire in

3402.599 --> 3407.839
cross-referencing logic really there's

3405.28 --> 3409.76
only a limited spectrum in which to

3407.839 --> 3411.68
cross-reference things and that is in

3409.76 --> 3415.28
the assumption

3411.68 --> 3418.0
that all that exoteric chanting is more

3415.28 --> 3420.48
important than jesus's words and his

3418.0 --> 3420.48
advice

3422.4 --> 3426.079
you want to get banned bro

3428.079 --> 3433.4
are you trying to

3429.92 --> 3433.4
baller me

3435.68 --> 3438.68
huh

3448.079 --> 3454.28
or are you gonna address

3450.559 --> 3454.28
what i just said

3469.2 --> 3476.3999999999996
yes i know that david games yes i know

3473.04 --> 3480.24
that i know what the freaking bible is

3476.4 --> 3480.2400000000002
don't try to patronize me bro

3481.119 --> 3485.28
you think i would say any of this if i

3483.599 --> 3488.1600000000003
didn't know what the hell i was talking

3485.28 --> 3490.799
about

3488.16 --> 3492.799
i think this is just my own internal

3490.799 --> 3494.96
secret project

3492.799 --> 3498.319
you think i don't actually talk about

3494.96 --> 3498.319
this with other people

3498.64 --> 3503.839
in private

3500.24 --> 3503.839
to work this out

3506.72 --> 3511.68
i'm not the only one that that thinks

3508.96 --> 3514.48
likes this okay

3511.68 --> 3516.799
there's a whole bunch of revolutionaries

3514.48 --> 3520.079
out there in the world that are figuring

3516.799 --> 3523.52
out exactly what i'm talking about

3520.079 --> 3523.52
completely by themselves

3525.359 --> 3531.5989999999997
yeah that's right

3528.319 --> 3535.96
that is correct

3531.599 --> 3535.96
i do not trust his intentions

3549.68 --> 3554.48
that's [ __ ] george sanford you want

3551.76 --> 3557.119
to get banned

3554.48 --> 3559.599
i remember the last time i banned you

3557.119 --> 3561.119
and then unbanned you again

3559.599 --> 3563.28
because of grace

3561.119 --> 3565.76

3582.88 --> 3587.04
what you're

3584.24 --> 3590.16
misquoting me yeah

3587.04 --> 3592.0
is that no i haven't read every freaking

3590.16 --> 3593.92
detail in the bible i'm not like a

3592.0 --> 3595.2
person that's read it like a hundred

3593.92 --> 3596.079
times

3595.2 --> 3597.5989999999997
yeah

3596.079 --> 3600.2400000000002
i have read it

3597.599 --> 3602.6400000000003
[ __ ]

that's freaking obsessed you must read

3655.92 --> 3660.4
the bible every day

3657.92 --> 3663.599
no what i do instead is

3660.4 --> 3665.28
i think about it i think about what this

3663.599 --> 3668.4
is

3665.28 --> 3672.76
what it really is and how people dwell

3668.4 --> 3672.76
in it and lose themselves

3688.24 --> 3693.1189999999997
i accept jesus i accept jesus's

3690.96 --> 3696.079
teachings i accept

3693.119 --> 3696.079
his example

3696.16 --> 3703.2
yeah i accept jesus i accept

3699.52 --> 3705.92
his way his path his example and

3703.2 --> 3710.24
especially his promise

3705.92 --> 3710.2400000000002
that others can be like him

3710.48 --> 3713.599
and can even surpass him

3712.72 --> 3714.9599999999996
would

3713.599 --> 3717.039
god

3714.96 --> 3719.839
the creator

3717.039 --> 3721.76

you're forgiven for your shortcomings

3802.0 --> 3804.64
good servant

3806.16 --> 3811.3999999999996
i hope i hope you appreciate that that's

3808.24 --> 3811.3999999999996
a joke

3816.24 --> 3821.0389999999998
we get our ideas with jesus from the bot

3818.559 --> 3824.559
no yeah but his words the actual

3821.039 --> 3827.599
apostles actually heard jesus christ

3824.559 --> 3830.0
talk and they witnessed him

3827.599 --> 3830.7200000000003
and they wrote it

3830.0 --> 3832.64
and

3830.72 --> 3836.0
maybe a bunch of their own ideas and

3832.64 --> 3836.0
internal workings yeah

3837.359 --> 3844.4
so i i don't see what your problem is

3840.72 --> 3844.3999999999996
you're gonna have to get over this bro

3844.559 --> 3851.52
yeah i believe in jesus i believe he is

3848.88 --> 3855.28
was the best of us

3851.52 --> 3857.92
i don't think he actually needed to die

3855.28 --> 3859.8390000000004
although he would have gone through a

3857.92 --> 3863.599
what is

3859.839 --> 3864.799
an experience that is as good as death

3863.599 --> 3868.799
right

3864.799 --> 3868.799
it's more than any could handle

3870.16 --> 3873.7599999999998
and

3871.28 --> 3877.52
yeah it's just his words

3873.76 --> 3878.88
his words he laid the groundworks for

3877.52 --> 3881.28
ascension

3878.88 --> 3884.7200000000003
for figuring a way through

3881.28 --> 3887.92
for how do you systematically no matter

3884.72 --> 3889.359
what the circumstances or the error is

3887.92 --> 3890.559
how

3889.359 --> 3893.68
do you

3890.559 --> 3897.44
overcome the darkness how do you realize

3893.68 --> 3900.319
it that it is darkness and bypass it

3897.44 --> 3901.92
or solve it

3900.319 --> 3904.16
or avoid it

3901.92 --> 3908.28
that's bypassing right

3904.16 --> 3908.2799999999997
yeah that's what i do

3910.559 --> 3915.3590000000004
i didn't say that you're straw manning

3912.24 --> 3918.64
me now one more of that david cain's one

3915.359 --> 3918.64
more and you're banned

3920.24 --> 3927.4399999999996
don't you freaking put any words in my

3923.359 --> 3929.92
mouth you trinitarian piece of [ __ ]

3927.44 --> 3929.92
all right

3930.4 --> 3935.28
did i say apostles made up stuff no

3933.359 --> 3937.52
that's not what i said

3935.28 --> 3939.76
[ __ ]

3937.52 --> 3942.96
why don't you stop putting words in my

3939.76 --> 3942.96
mouth [ __ ]

3946.96 --> 3950.7200000000003
you you we're not even having the same

3949.039 --> 3953.2000000000003
conversation

3950.72 --> 3954.799
you're literally working

3953.2 --> 3957.7599999999998
on a level two

3954.799 --> 3960.4
when i'm working on a level seven here

3957.76 --> 3963.76
okay i'm talking

3960.4 --> 3965.839
fractal you're talking linear you don't

3963.76 --> 3967.3590000000004
even understand what i'm saying you

3965.839 --> 3968.88
can't even see

3967.359 --> 3971.7599999999998
the depth

3968.88 --> 3974.319
of the value of what i'm saying

3971.76 --> 3976.88
you are literally not on the same

3974.319 --> 3979.359
frequency you don't know what i'm saying

3976.88 --> 3982.1600000000003
you don't understand what i'm saying

3979.359 --> 3984.72
you don't get it you're stuck in

3982.16 --> 3987.52
exoteric chanting

3984.72 --> 3990.5589999999997
you've literally put your lifeline onto

3987.52 --> 3993.839
that and now you've lost the freedom of

3990.559 --> 3993.8390000000004
your own mind

3995.039 --> 4001.7200000000003
put words in my mouth one more time and

3998.16 --> 4001.72
i'm banning you

4014.079 --> 4020.039
okay return to no more level not fine

4016.16 --> 4020.0389999999998
it's just a comparison

4030.0 --> 4033.369
[Music]

4035.839 --> 4039.2
that's right nathan r

4037.599 --> 4043.119
but david

4039.2 --> 4045.1189999999997
came thought it was okay

4043.119 --> 4049.039
it was okay to

4045.119 --> 4053.119
to twist it like that right because he

4049.039 --> 4056.88
wants me to be exposed i need to be

4053.119 --> 4058.7200000000003
exposed i don't chant your stupid little

4056.88 --> 4060.96
riddle that you don't understand and

4058.72 --> 4063.4399999999996
doesn't make any sense yeah so he just

4060.96 --> 4064.319
wants me to be exposed

4063.44 --> 4066.559
right

4064.319 --> 4068.48
just like a baller

4066.559 --> 4071.3590000000004
with a flat earther just like an

4068.48 --> 4074.16
anti-flat earther they just want us to

4071.359 --> 4077.92
be exposed because we don't say the

4074.16 --> 4080.16
things they want us to say

4077.92 --> 4084.079
because they're scumbags

4080.16 --> 4086.16
they're demon driven pharisees

4084.079 --> 4087.3590000000004
and they don't even have to consciously

4086.16 --> 4088.799
know it

4087.359 --> 4090.5589999999997
but we will

4088.799 --> 4093.359
by their actions

4090.559 --> 4097.52
if we don't get caught up through peer

4093.359 --> 4097.5199999999995
pressure and fear-based weakness

4098.88 --> 4105.159000000001
now laugh it up fundy

4101.199 --> 4105.159
laugh it up david games

4113.679 --> 4118.96
that's right one fodder unit that's

4116.08 --> 4121.199
absolutely right and besides it's not

4118.96 --> 4121.199
true

4122.96 --> 4128.319
somebody dying in

4125.359 --> 4130.96
extraordinary circumstances no matter

4128.319 --> 4134.719
what they are presumed to be

4130.96 --> 4137.92
is not going to take away sin because

4134.719 --> 4140.4800000000005
sin is inherent to the design it is what

4137.92 --> 4144.96
we all face what we all need to deal

4140.48 --> 4145.839
with and what we all pay the price for

4144.96 --> 4148.719
in

4145.839 --> 4152.799
our lifetime

4148.719 --> 4152.799
it's the design in itself

4153.12 --> 4159.599999999999
you can't take it away

4157.359 --> 4161.6
right

4159.6 --> 4164.2390000000005
and besides

4161.6 --> 4166.799
if you really look into that

4164.239 --> 4169.2789999999995
then you realize that maybe they just

4166.799 --> 4171.359
displace the entire concept of

4169.279 --> 4176.2390000000005
consequences of sin maybe that's what

4171.359 --> 4178.400000000001
they wanted to hide maybe the priests

4176.239 --> 4180.48
yeah

4178.4 --> 4182.3189999999995
the priests

4180.48 --> 4185.678999999999
the catholics

4182.319 --> 4189.1990000000005
and everything that came from that right

4185.679 --> 4193.1990000000005
they they didn't want people to know

4189.199 --> 4195.5199999999995
that sins have consequences immediately

4193.199 --> 4196.799999999999
in your life god doesn't wait till

4195.52 --> 4200.64
you're dead

4196.8 --> 4203.679
yeah you get it right there

4200.64 --> 4206.400000000001
and the only way you could perceive that

4203.679 --> 4209.04
that isn't true is because it was

4206.4 --> 4210.96
shielded from your own consciousness you

4209.04 --> 4211.84
would rather deny

4210.96 --> 4215.199
that

4211.84 --> 4216.719
and be okay with denying that even

4215.199 --> 4219.12
though it's happening right there in

4216.719 --> 4220.56
front of you

4219.12 --> 4222.159
that's better

4220.56 --> 4223.679
right that's that's really how that

4222.159 --> 4225.839999999999
works

4223.679 --> 4228.64
they want you to forget that there is

4225.84 --> 4230.56
immediate consequences within the design

4228.64 --> 4232.320000000001
within your conscious life

4230.56 --> 4235.679
and that is part of the point that's

4232.32 --> 4235.679
part of the learning process

4236.0 --> 4242.239
the payment for sins doesn't come after

4239.04 --> 4244.48
death it comes in life

4242.239 --> 4246.239
that's what it is it's the burden

4244.48 --> 4248.4
of the memory

4246.239 --> 4250.239
and the things that are taken away

4248.4 --> 4254.879999999999
because of the sin

4250.239 --> 4258.239
that is the payment yeah

4254.88 --> 4260.88
and somebody dying in history so that

4258.239 --> 4263.28
this presumed

4260.88 --> 4264.8
afterlife and i'm not saying there isn't

4263.28 --> 4267.679
any

4264.8 --> 4270.320000000001
that because that happened the afterlife

4267.679 --> 4273.04
is just all hunky-dory well how would

4270.32 --> 4277.36
you how does that make any sense nobody

4273.04 --> 4277.36
knows what happens after death nobody

4281.04 --> 4284.64
like not with certainty

4285.28 --> 4290.5599999999995
but since the world is created and

4288.159 --> 4293.44
designed

4290.56 --> 4294.159000000001
one must imagine that the designer of it

4293.44 --> 4297.28
all

4294.159 --> 4299.36
putting humanity in such a central spot

4297.28 --> 4300.719
centered around the challenges we face

4299.36 --> 4303.12
in the sins

4300.719 --> 4305.36
the earthly spirit we we have to deal

4303.12 --> 4305.36
with

4305.84 --> 4310.96
it's a nice idea to think that

4308.8 --> 4313.679
he'll

4310.96 --> 4316.88
give us like a consolidation price after

4313.679 --> 4319.28
our struggles after we die

4316.88 --> 4321.36
and that while we live we'll reflect

4319.28 --> 4324.32
upon that

4321.36 --> 4325.92
right but we don't know for certain so

4324.32 --> 4327.04
to say that

4325.92 --> 4329.84
well

4327.04 --> 4332.719
he did that thing jesus died for our

4329.84 --> 4334.2390000000005
sins so we can all go to heaven all you

4332.719 --> 4338.4
have to do is

4334.239 --> 4340.32
chant this stupid [ __ ] little riddle

4338.4 --> 4343.44
and whatever the [ __ ] you do no matter

4340.32 --> 4345.679
how horrific atrocious

4343.44 --> 4347.599999999999
evil demonic

4345.679 --> 4349.92
it's okay because you chanted the

4347.6 --> 4350.8
[ __ ] riddle so you can go to heaven

4349.92 --> 4354.08
now

4350.8 --> 4357.84
yeah that is

4354.08 --> 4357.84
satanic or [ __ ]

4365.679 --> 4372.92
hey gary we banged out james brown

4369.199 --> 4372.919999999999
i mean jason brown

4391.44 --> 4393.839999999999
woohoo

4394.8 --> 4399.84
turned shroud were caused by an intense

4397.12 --> 4399.84
bristol

4400.4 --> 4404.32
okay

4402.32 --> 4407.679
well how is it really relevant to

4404.32 --> 4407.679
anything though this shroud

4408.08 --> 4411.5199999999995
like

4409.12 --> 4414.0
i'm not saying

4411.52 --> 4416.8
it's bad no but like

4414.0 --> 4420.0
how is it relevant to any any of the

4416.8 --> 4420.0
actual teachings

4420.48 --> 4426.4
if you never heard jesus's words

4423.36 --> 4430.08
but you did face the turing shroud

4426.4 --> 4430.08
how would that improve your life

4436.96 --> 4441.04
i mean it might provide a sense of

4439.199 --> 4443.759999999999
wonder

4441.04 --> 4445.92
or something right that's cute

4443.76 --> 4448.96
how does it actually systemically

4445.92 --> 4450.4800000000005
improve your life

4448.96 --> 4452.08
it doesn't

4450.48 --> 4455.678999999999
it's only

4452.08 --> 4459.12
the teachings the words the advice and

4455.679 --> 4462.52
the insight that is there to be gained

4459.12 --> 4462.5199999999995
by the individual

4471.84 --> 4475.52
i am

4473.12 --> 4478.48
i reconcile everything

4475.52 --> 4480.56
everything i do and decide i explain

4478.48 --> 4483.5599999999995
i've all explained it you are not

4480.56 --> 4483.56
listening

4484.0 --> 4489.199
david keynes you are literally not

4486.159 --> 4491.839999999999
listening to a word i've said

4489.199 --> 4492.719
you don't want to get it

4491.84 --> 4494.0
all

4492.719 --> 4498.56
you do

4494.0 --> 4499.84
is hold up the chance one by one and

4498.56 --> 4502.96
then

4499.84 --> 4505.679
you rejected that chant you redejected

4502.96 --> 4509.12
that chant and that chant like how how

4505.679 --> 4513.76
dare you how can you get away with

4509.12 --> 4516.48
rejecting all the core chants

4513.76 --> 4519.04
of your priestly faith

4516.48 --> 4520.959999999999
that you have david kames because that's

4519.04 --> 4525.08
not christian

4520.96 --> 4525.08
nothing about that is christian

4525.12 --> 4528.719
it's just chanting

4529.36 --> 4535.04
amazing things that make no freaking

4532.0 --> 4537.28
logical sense that you cannot prove and

4535.04 --> 4540.8
that don't contribute

4537.28 --> 4543.599999999999
to improving your personal life

4540.8 --> 4546.2390000000005
none of these chants improve your

4543.6 --> 4549.679
personal life don't you see that it

4546.239 --> 4551.839999999999
doesn't do anything for you

4549.679 --> 4553.4400000000005
only the teachings

4551.84 --> 4555.6
do something

4553.44 --> 4557.599999999999
the teachings don't talk about this

4555.6 --> 4562.0
garbage

4557.6 --> 4564.159000000001
jesus doesn't talk about that garbage

4562.0 --> 4567.199
not like that

4564.159 --> 4569.679
not in that context not with all that

4567.199 --> 4571.599999999999
weight put onto it

4569.679 --> 4573.36
he doesn't do that

4571.6 --> 4576.4800000000005
why do you think that is

4573.36 --> 4578.48
could it be because priests afterward

4576.48 --> 4580.959999999999
after he was gone

4578.48 --> 4583.839999999999
made that crap up

4580.96 --> 4588.56
as a controlled opposition

4583.84 --> 4592.28
attempt to contain the magnificent glory

4588.56 --> 4592.280000000001
of his teachings

4597.44 --> 4599.759999999999
oh

4600.159 --> 4604.759999999999
i can't deal with this guy anymore guys

4608.88 --> 4614.08
i need an air brake this guy is really

4612.159 --> 4617.08
starting to piss me off he's just not

4614.08 --> 4617.08
listening

4644.239 --> 4649.36
authority of scripture what authority

4647.28 --> 4652.0
there's only one authority

4649.36 --> 4655.92
god the truth

4652.0 --> 4655.92
the truth is the authority

4658.32 --> 4664.04
what

4659.44 --> 4664.04
oh you think it's a bunch of people

4669.52 --> 4673.76
and uh

4671.199 --> 4675.839999999999
you know out there

4673.76 --> 4678.719
in the world

4675.84 --> 4681.360000000001
how is that working out for you

4678.719 --> 4681.36
authority

4681.84 --> 4687.52
into the hands of a bunch of people to

4683.84 --> 4689.28
determine something for everybody else

4687.52 --> 4692.080000000001
and then they must obey how is that

4689.28 --> 4694.96
working out for you is directly

4692.08 --> 4694.96
is that a good thing

4704.32 --> 4709.36
no it's the wind pj no there's no rain

4706.8 --> 4711.1990000000005
here no no no no if there was rain here

4709.36 --> 4712.96
i would tell you

4711.199 --> 4715.44
but it's just a nice breeze and it's

4712.96 --> 4719.2390000000005
pretty hot in here it's almost no

4715.44 --> 4719.239
t-shirt weather but

4738.159 --> 4741.839999999999
well okay then dave it came

4740.96 --> 4744.2390000000005
sure

4741.84 --> 4747.679
yeah word on god

4744.239 --> 4750.639999999999
came from god yeah totally yeah

4747.679 --> 4753.679
now let me interpret that in a little

4750.64 --> 4756.08
bit more sensible manner for you how

4753.679 --> 4759.52
about that yeah

4756.08 --> 4763.12
let's step away from the nonsensical

4759.52 --> 4766.159000000001
esoteric chanting [ __ ] that makes no

4763.12 --> 4770.719
logical sense that you can't actually

4766.159 --> 4770.719
do anything useful with how about that

4772.8 --> 4777.84
yeah your interpretations suck

4802.56 --> 4806.159000000001
nice that's awesome one father you and

4804.96 --> 4808.4
he said that

4806.159 --> 4808.4
huh

4809.679 --> 4813.28
yeah they get it man

4811.6 --> 4817.1990000000005
like

4813.28 --> 4820.0
it's so embarrassing it it really is

4817.199 --> 4821.28
horrifically embarrassing

4820.0 --> 4822.239
that

4821.28 --> 4824.48
like

4822.239 --> 4825.839999999999
people

4824.48 --> 4828.4
that follow

4825.84 --> 4828.400000000001
muhammad

4829.36 --> 4834.88
they understand christi christ better

4832.56 --> 4836.8
than christians do

4834.88 --> 4842.0
because they don't have that tradition

4836.8 --> 4842.0
of accelero esoteric chanting [ __ ]

4843.44 --> 4848.4
not about jesus at least right they

4846.239 --> 4849.678999999999
might have their own problems with

4848.4 --> 4851.599999999999
muhammad

4849.679 --> 4854.56
and like the quran

4851.6 --> 4855.84
like it's complicated i'm not i'm not

4854.56 --> 4858.0
gonna like

4855.84 --> 4859.679
overtly criticize anything about it

4858.0 --> 4861.44
because i don't understand it like

4859.679 --> 4863.6
there's a book that i haven't actually

4861.44 --> 4866.0
read right but i have heard a lot about

4863.6 --> 4868.719
it and i have

4866.0 --> 4870.48
some manner of respect

4868.719 --> 4873.36
which is more than i can say for most

4870.48 --> 4876.239
christians that literally just chant

4873.36 --> 4878.799999999999
like islam is the devil

4876.239 --> 4882.718999999999
absolutely preposterous

4878.8 --> 4884.719
right when they understand jesus better

4882.719 --> 4887.96
than christians

4884.719 --> 4887.96
it's pathetic

4891.679 --> 4894.679
uh

4905.12 --> 4908.12
so

4932.4 --> 4938.32
uh well you're incorrect there

4935.6 --> 4938.320000000001
you're incorrect

4939.76 --> 4945.280000000001
you don't you don't even know what's

4941.76 --> 4947.4400000000005
going on in this world you've been

4945.28 --> 4949.679
chanting

4947.44 --> 4951.5199999999995
echoing chants for so long you're

4949.679 --> 4954.159
literally saying something that's just

4951.52 --> 4956.320000000001
incorrect so you don't even know what

4954.159 --> 4958.08
the hell is going on in this world

4956.32 --> 4960.4
you're just something said something

4958.08 --> 4962.08
that is just wrong

4960.4 --> 4964.32
and i'm not even gonna point it out to

4962.08 --> 4964.32
you

4971.12 --> 4975.44
yeah jesus was a prophet absolutely

4976.08 --> 4980.639
and i think he was the best prophet ever

4980.88 --> 4986.52
i highly favor jesus over any other

4983.52 --> 4986.52
prophets

5005.76 --> 5010.400000000001
it's okay steven traveler

5007.76 --> 5010.400000000001
welcome back

5010.48 --> 5015.5199999999995
you're deleting your the live app

5013.04 --> 5017.04
all right

5015.52 --> 5019.76
yeah the live

5017.04 --> 5023.36
apps for mobile interface doesn't seem

5019.76 --> 5023.360000000001
to be all that great i've heard

5023.52 --> 5028.4800000000005
yeah yeah okay david came you can

5026.08 --> 5030.639
[ __ ] off now i'm done with your chanting

5028.48 --> 5032.638999999999
goodbye

5030.639 --> 5035.92
said everything that's needed to be said

5032.639 --> 5038.08
i'm not gonna sit through just repeating

5035.92 --> 5039.76
your chat i don't wanna hear your repeat

5038.08 --> 5041.04
a chance anymore

5039.76 --> 5044.159000000001
get out

5041.04 --> 5044.159
you don't need to come back

5044.4 --> 5048.5599999999995
but thank you for participating as an

5047.04 --> 5052.239
example

5048.56 --> 5054.4800000000005
as to what the hell is actually wrong

5052.239 --> 5057.04
with trinitarians because you were the

5054.48 --> 5058.08
perfect example and it's all on record

5057.04 --> 5059.5199999999995
it's all

5058.08 --> 5062.84
in the video

5059.52 --> 5062.84
right there

5073.64 --> 5076.839
[Music]

5093.28 --> 5098.88
what infighting

5095.52 --> 5101.6
george sanford there's no infighting

5098.88 --> 5104.159000000001
david cain's

5101.6 --> 5106.0
is i'm not a part of that

5104.159 --> 5108.48
it's not infighting

5106.0 --> 5111.679
as far as i'm concerned

5108.48 --> 5115.199
the whole trinitarian movement

5111.679 --> 5118.719
are accidental pharisees

5115.199 --> 5121.5199999999995
they are not part of my group i it's not

5118.719 --> 5121.52
infighting

5121.679 --> 5127.6
i reject them utterly in the name of

5125.679 --> 5130.76
jesus

5127.6 --> 5130.76
you understand

5136.46 --> 5139.51
[Music]

5143.84 --> 5149.96
[Music]

5146.96 --> 5149.96
so

5155.84 --> 5160.88
that's right

5157.12 --> 5160.88
god is number one

5165.6 --> 5169.120000000001
worship

5166.719 --> 5171.84
god or

5169.12 --> 5174.08
know god would be even better

5171.84 --> 5175.679
right worship is even a dangerous word

5174.08 --> 5176.88
because worship

5175.679 --> 5180.52
basically

5176.88 --> 5180.52
enslaves you

5184.239 --> 5188.48
and there's only one thing anybody

5186.48 --> 5192.638999999999
should be enslaved to ever and that is

5188.48 --> 5195.44
the truth and since the truth is god

5192.639 --> 5196.400000000001
as our lies the devil

5195.44 --> 5199.5199999999995
yeah

5196.4 --> 5199.5199999999995
worship god

5199.76 --> 5203.04
worship the truth

5208.56 --> 5212.8
that's the only thing you should never a

5210.639 --> 5216.159000000001
person never an idol

5212.8 --> 5216.159000000001
never something separate

5222.56 --> 5229.1990000000005
maybe being off god well

5225.92 --> 5229.1990000000005
it's too complicated

5230.239 --> 5234.48
but technically i don't like to worship

5233.04 --> 5237.36
anything

5234.48 --> 5241.28
but since god in my view is pretty much

5237.36 --> 5241.28
everything is the designer he is

5241.84 --> 5246.400000000001
all of it

5244.08 --> 5246.4
then

5248.239 --> 5253.239
i don't worship things that are separate

5253.92 --> 5258.0
because if i do that then i'd separate

5256.32 --> 5260.88
myself

5258.0 --> 5263.84
and i don't want to

5260.88 --> 5266.84
i shouldn't christ advised against it as

5263.84 --> 5266.84
well

5267.84 --> 5273.52
but if you see god as truth

5270.8 --> 5274.719
then to worship the truth

5273.52 --> 5277.120000000001
is

5274.719 --> 5277.12
okay

5277.76 --> 5282.400000000001
but the truth is

5279.679 --> 5285.36
always what happens in the moment it is

5282.4 --> 5286.799999999999
true or it is not truth cannot be

5285.36 --> 5290.32
contained

5286.8 --> 5293.12
in a chant and that cannot then echo on

5290.32 --> 5295.36
for the ages unless it was always and

5293.12 --> 5298.719
will always be true

5295.36 --> 5301.12
right so the truth is elusive in a way

5298.719 --> 5303.36
and it's part of the supernatural the

5301.12 --> 5305.5199999999995
information cycle

5303.36 --> 5307.36
of what things are

5305.52 --> 5308.719
you can't contain it

5307.36 --> 5310.639
but if you

5308.719 --> 5313.199
follow it

5310.639 --> 5315.12
if you worship god

5313.199 --> 5316.638999999999
through truth

5315.12 --> 5318.8
speak the truth

5316.639 --> 5321.679
follow the truth

5318.8 --> 5323.76
well then maybe that is worship of god

5321.679 --> 5326.32
right it's

5323.76 --> 5328.400000000001
it's a bit esoteric it's difficult per

5326.32 --> 5332.719
default i always say like just don't

5328.4 --> 5332.719
worship idols don't worship a person

5333.04 --> 5336.36
or a personification

5337.36 --> 5343.759999999999
like don't make a statue to worship

5341.52 --> 5346.8
do it inside

5343.76 --> 5348.719
connect to god inside only

5346.8 --> 5350.88
that's the only true place to really

5348.719 --> 5354.6
find him jesus

5350.88 --> 5354.6
told you that

5365.28 --> 5368.88
right

5366.159 --> 5370.159
yes clutchbear love with all your heart

5368.88 --> 5373.6
and all that

5370.159 --> 5375.44
but also don't give your authority to

5373.6 --> 5377.120000000001
another don't

5375.44 --> 5378.5599999999995
seek a middleman

5377.12 --> 5382.28
for god

5378.56 --> 5382.280000000001
find him in yourself

5399.84 --> 5403.159000000001
hello mystical

5408.4 --> 5412.159
how about forgiveness so we may be

5410.639 --> 5414.400000000001
forgiven

5412.159 --> 5414.4
uh

5416.08 --> 5419.96
that depends on the situation

5420.639 --> 5425.1990000000005
but you know forgiveness is a very

5422.719 --> 5428.4800000000005
complicated thing as to really even

5425.199 --> 5428.48
properly define it

5429.28 --> 5433.5199999999995
it's an act

5431.92 --> 5435.4400000000005
but

5433.52 --> 5437.120000000001
what does it really imply i'm not gonna

5435.44 --> 5439.28
i don't want to really get into it

5437.12 --> 5442.32
completely right now i actually wanted

5439.28 --> 5442.32
to round out the show

5443.04 --> 5447.12
right

5444.4 --> 5449.839999999999
but forgiveness in my opinion requires

5447.12 --> 5449.84
understanding

5451.6 --> 5456.2390000000005
like how can you forgive something you

5453.36 --> 5456.239
don't understand

5458.56 --> 5463.280000000001
right

5459.84 --> 5465.84
forgiveness should never be

5463.28 --> 5468.159
a thing that would lead to

5465.84 --> 5470.159000000001
the thing that is forgiven to be

5468.159 --> 5472.4
repeated endlessly

5470.159 --> 5472.4
right

5473.76 --> 5478.159000000001
so yeah forgiveness is a tricky thing

5478.32 --> 5481.759999999999
especially in this age in an age where

5480.48 --> 5483.839999999999
demons grow

5481.76 --> 5484.639
are rampant

5483.84 --> 5487.4400000000005
and

5484.639 --> 5489.4400000000005
highly influential and literally drag

5487.44 --> 5492.239
everything and are

5489.44 --> 5494.4
like they can get to anybody quickly

5492.239 --> 5497.599999999999
through media etc etc

5494.4 --> 5498.879999999999
yeah forgiveness is a tricky thing

5497.6 --> 5501.6
but

5498.88 --> 5502.639
in a universal sense it's never really

5501.6 --> 5505.280000000001
healthy

5502.639 --> 5508.159000000001
to hold on to grudges

5505.28 --> 5508.159
for very long

5509.36 --> 5514.639
so yeah it's complicated maybe i'll talk

5511.6 --> 5514.639
about it another time

5514.8 --> 5520.0
is it that time already yeah i know

5516.48 --> 5521.919999999999
right that how the time has flown

5520.0 --> 5525.6
one and a half hour already i can't

5521.92 --> 5528.84
believe it but it's been very intense

5525.6 --> 5528.84
and interesting

5532.48 --> 5537.959999999999
and very appropriate for a sunday show

5534.8 --> 5537.96
as well

5554.32 --> 5558.799999999999
right so yeah

5555.76 --> 5561.84
yeah how would you define forgiveness

5558.8 --> 5564.56
is like forgiveness if it is effectively

5561.84 --> 5564.56
letting go

5566.0 --> 5571.28
of pain caused by something so everybody

5569.12 --> 5574.32
can move on then it would be a good

5571.28 --> 5576.48
thing but if that would lead to the pain

5574.32 --> 5579.12
and the situation

5576.48 --> 5580.959999999999
just repeating then if forgiveness is

5579.12 --> 5584.5599999999995
not effective

5580.96 --> 5584.56
right it needs to be stopped

5587.679 --> 5591.92
so yeah forgiveness is in many ways

5589.84 --> 5593.28
something that kind of comes afterward

5591.92 --> 5595.6
you always have to

5593.28 --> 5597.44
fix the situation first before

5595.6 --> 5600.2390000000005
forgiveness

5597.44 --> 5600.239
has any point

5601.28 --> 5604.88
right it's no use to forgive somebody if

5603.76 --> 5607.08
if they

5604.88 --> 5608.719
don't care if they're just gonna do

5607.08 --> 5610.88
[Music]

5608.719 --> 5612.56
whatever you forgave them for if they're

5610.88 --> 5616.1990000000005
just gonna do that and they don't care

5612.56 --> 5616.1990000000005
then what's the point

5625.84 --> 5630.1990000000005
yeah nobody cares george sanford

5631.44 --> 5635.5199999999995
right i am rounding out the show now so

5636.0 --> 5641.12
thanks everyone for coming i hope you

5638.56 --> 5643.04
like this show i thought it was great

5641.12 --> 5645.44
