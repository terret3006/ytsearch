115.32 --> 125.79899999999999
so I'm gonna bite into that pretty soon

118.75 --> 128.909
because I'm very hungry so let's see who

125.799 --> 128.90900000000002
is in chat today

138.4 --> 145.34
that was weird the scroll function in

141.739 --> 148.22
the chat was gone all of a sudden weird

145.34 --> 149.049
anyway Amanda young was first michael

148.22 --> 155.45
roark

149.049 --> 163.09
hm high level awakening Julia Giulio

155.45 --> 168.23
Pavan Obama co-star e-cig dust and

163.09 --> 169.22
Fyodor Dostoevsky right good to see you

168.23 --> 174.82899999999998
all

169.22 --> 180.56
no specific subjects today might come

174.829 --> 186.79000000000002
though but you had a long sleep very

180.56 --> 186.79
long hey I killed hope good to see you a

189.129 --> 194.959
dentist appointment sees yeah

192.439 --> 198.07899999999998
surprisingly it sounds really weird to

194.959 --> 202.81900000000002
me but I'm still recovering although

198.079 --> 204.98000000000002
seem to be the last phases which means

202.819 --> 207.91899999999998
that I wake up sweating a lot it's

204.98 --> 213.79899999999998
really annoying but that means at least

207.919 --> 217.459
that yeah it's really gonna go away

213.799 --> 223.609
finally hey oh yeah how's the bird doing

217.459 --> 226.93
outside yeah pretty incredible I almost

223.609 --> 230.359
got it to eat out of my hand today

226.93 --> 233.239
really like it was sitting right there

230.359 --> 239.65900000000002
on the balcony it's sitting yes standing

233.239 --> 241.94
now way over there and I just took a

239.659 --> 244.37
bunch of crumbs in my hand

241.94 --> 247.76
clear least sizable that it could be

244.37 --> 251.68
seen and just walked up to it very very

247.76 --> 255.29
very slowly until I was literally within

251.68 --> 257.389
within grasps reach so my fingertips

255.29 --> 261.139
were no more than five centimeters away

257.389 --> 265.159
from it but it didn't get it or it was

261.139 --> 266.75
like didn't expect it and was nervous so

265.159 --> 269.84
it kept still

266.75 --> 272.6
so didn't really respond yet and then of

269.84 --> 274.84999999999997
course I just threw it on to the

272.6 --> 278.69
familiar spot and it went right after it

274.85 --> 280.70000000000005
but it yeah it didn't didn't eat out of

278.69 --> 283.96999999999997
my hand maybe but it wasn't afraid

280.7 --> 292.31
enough to to bolt away and that was

283.97 --> 297.32000000000005
pretty amazing I thought so yeah the

292.31 --> 305.89
crows still hanging around it in a way

297.32 --> 308.51
I've it's kind of a pushy creature so

305.89 --> 311.53999999999996
sometimes I just want to have a smoke

308.51 --> 315.8
outside and then it'll just like try to

311.54 --> 318.89000000000004
get things off me and distract me a lot

315.8 --> 322.04
so it's not all good it's also a bit

318.89 --> 324.59
annoying sometimes I have to find the

322.04 --> 327.8
right balance and try not to scare it

324.59 --> 330.61999999999995
away too much but we yeah we have to

327.8 --> 334.669
find an understanding I have to set its

330.62 --> 340.16
boundaries somehow in a consistent way

334.669 --> 343.28
and yeah I know it is what it is with

340.16 --> 346.24
animals I it's not the first time I've

343.28 --> 348.59
engaged with you had elaborate

346.24 --> 352.66
interactions with wild animals like that

348.59 --> 352.65999999999997
love it especially birds

354.539 --> 367.02
yeah most parents thank you for that ATM

361.289 --> 369.82
right that's hilarious

367.02 --> 372.29999999999995
I'm definitely not getting married to

369.82 --> 372.3
that true

390.13 --> 393.37
[Music]

397.06 --> 401.25
yeah query that would be interesting

404.52 --> 412.18
clear for some reason in Dutch as

407.29 --> 416.23
telling me to make photographs of the

412.18 --> 422.65000000000003
Dyke which happens to be a very very

416.23 --> 425.56
long and perfectly level bridge that

422.65 --> 431.67999999999995
spans several kilometers o bridge yeah

425.56 --> 437.98
it is a dike that separates the the

431.68 --> 446.32
North Sea from the what is it the North

437.98 --> 450.93
Atlantic Ocean and it turns yeah a part

446.32 --> 454.54
of the the it is still salty there but

450.93 --> 459.1
it enabled the Dutch the polar out

454.54 --> 460.72
certain regions in the ocean and the

459.1 --> 462.99
rest is pretty much like a salty lake

460.72 --> 462.99
now

472.11 --> 477.96000000000004
so yeah that bridge would definitely be

475.09 --> 480.669
worth that going there with the camera

477.96 --> 482.59
although yeah I'm probably gonna need

480.669 --> 484.9
some kind of car transport for that

482.59 --> 495.21
because it's not exactly near a train

484.9 --> 495.21
station okay

496.16 --> 499.81
lots of trolls here

515.49 --> 523.02
but yeah I'd love to do it at some point

519.01 --> 523.02
who knows with one of the Dutch guys

523.86 --> 532.39
like Aaron or Eric you dope

526.63 --> 533.7
or maybe also combine I think we all

532.39 --> 537.93
have p900

533.7 --> 537.9300000000001
let's just make a day out of it

545.66 --> 553.5
it would be good it had added by the way

549.24 --> 555.62
to have a I guess aid a Dutch activism

553.5 --> 558.21
Skype group or something like that

555.62 --> 561.24
specifically so not centered around my

558.21 --> 565.89
early bird show or anything but just us

561.24 --> 571.2
guys in so we can set a date or anything

565.89 --> 575.1899999999999
ah like you know yeah I have a driver's

571.2 --> 581.37
license - no car I think Aaron has a car

575.19 --> 583.8800000000001
I'm not sure 100% but anyway we'll

581.37 --> 583.88
figure it out

586.65 --> 593.52
and look if there's like no other way we

590.4 --> 602.99
can just rent a car for a day that'll

593.52 --> 605.8199999999999
work fine yeah hello by the way

602.99 --> 612.14
gaining wisdom wrecking stuff in the

605.82 --> 612.1400000000001
house in Aries 106 and Nathan Oakley

621.65 --> 624.61
mm-hmm

624.68 --> 630.1289999999999
oh it seems like the globe light or is

627.319 --> 637.699
now going live in Hungary Budapest

630.129 --> 640.279
that's interesting I wonder if dation he

637.699 --> 644.6189999999999
could go there that's like his country

640.279 --> 648.019
right that would be fun to see him

644.619 --> 648.499
interact in real life from there I don't

648.019 --> 653.319
know

648.499 --> 653.3190000000001
I hope somebody informed him about it

654.22 --> 660.9100000000001
you know what I'll just got message him

657.8 --> 660.91
right now about it

663.14 --> 667.669
[Music]

664.2 --> 667.6690000000001
[Applause]

667.94 --> 671.0290000000001
[Music]

683.28 --> 686.8299999999999
[Applause]

701.55 --> 707.3389999999999
[Music]

703.75 --> 707.339
yeah anyway we'll see

718.089 --> 721.6300000000001
okay clearing

723.0 --> 731.0
yeah who knows a guest the guest could

726.329 --> 731.0
be nice I wouldn't mind

741.11 --> 748.25
to be fair again didn't keep too much

744.11 --> 749.78
track of what was going down I have been

748.25 --> 753.41
watching a lot of Alex Jones recently

749.78 --> 755.9499999999999
though I think I don't know I just get

753.41 --> 759.68
dragged into that kind of stuff even

755.95 --> 762.0500000000001
though I tend to not like the like on

759.68 --> 766.76
the edge polettis I eat the political

762.05 --> 768.8299999999999
stuff but not anymore like yeah you stay

766.76 --> 771.4399999999999
you know ten years ago but now I'm just

768.83 --> 775.5500000000001
like so oversaturated it's just like we

771.44 --> 778.75
get it already in anyway targets

775.55 --> 785.9599999999999
audience and target audiences and all

778.75 --> 789.4
but the OEM watch Owen Benjamin ah still

785.96 --> 792.6800000000001
haven't finished watching it should

789.4 --> 794.72
starting to fall behind because he got

792.68 --> 801.14
back after yeah Eve had a break for a

794.72 --> 802.99
while there during his tour and yeah

801.14 --> 806.62
now he's just back to doing it every day

802.99 --> 806.62
keep forgetting it

807.68 --> 810.78
[Music]

812.64 --> 822.38
and what whoa hello Jose are you okay

836.24 --> 841.819
okay no I don't know why would it just

839.779 --> 850.009
don't get what's going on with him you

841.819 --> 854.7199999999999
know is it because I refused your invite

850.009 --> 860.2090000000001
to go on the show and said that I didn't

854.72 --> 862.22
want to polish the turd because that

860.209 --> 863.929
might have been a little bit mean but I

862.22 --> 871.839
don't know you know you're you're acting

863.929 --> 874.85
like a lunatic so that's why yeah I

871.839 --> 879.499
can't just keep on acting friendly to

874.85 --> 882.3190000000001
you while you misbehave you know and

879.499 --> 885.74
dedicate negative [ __ ] to me and and all

882.319 --> 888.92
that it's very tough to do but I really

885.74 --> 892.759
to this day don't get why you're even

888.92 --> 895.819
doing this it doesn't make any sense to

892.759 --> 898.22
me really don't see what I've done to

895.819 --> 900.9699999999999
certainly make you switch around towards

898.22 --> 900.97
me specifically

904.7 --> 910.51
yeah but whatever man no it's your life

933.3 --> 936.4
[Music]

959.96 --> 963.129
[Music]

964.45 --> 971.73
they are clearly please stop doing that

967.68 --> 971.7299999999999
just talk English

980.42 --> 983.52
[Music]

984.069 --> 994.9989999999999
yep Dave Johnson that was always a part

987.319 --> 998.649
of this show always was so me like it

994.999 --> 1002.1890000000001
some may dislike it I don't really care

998.649 --> 1004.66
because it's a part of the show it's a a

1002.189 --> 1008.079
supposed to breakfast show although it's

1004.66 --> 1011.079
not breakfast time for me yes for a lot

1008.079 --> 1015.6389999999999
of people in the US and that was the

1011.079 --> 1019.449
original target designation and it still

1015.639 --> 1023.35
is even though there seems to be a lot

1019.449 --> 1026.62
of British people also visiting so the

1023.35 --> 1030.039
the British audience overall whether

1026.62 --> 1032.6689999999999
they be trolls are yeah flat earthers

1030.039 --> 1037.51
day they are they have expanded more

1032.669 --> 1041.8290000000002
than I originally expected compared to

1037.51 --> 1049.09
the United States and in Australia New

1041.829 --> 1052.539
Zealand but that probably not surprising

1049.09 --> 1059.1
because there's a just a lot of a lot of

1052.539 --> 1059.1
upheaval going on in England in general

1061.44 --> 1074.05
[Music]

1064.09 --> 1081.61
yeah yeah hey Trish flight look who's

1074.05 --> 1084.43
not banned did you see Riley's latest

1081.61 --> 1086.1699999999998
hangout about about you and it wasn't

1084.43 --> 1090.28
previous one the one before that was

1086.17 --> 1094.38
pretty good I know you've seen it I

1090.28 --> 1094.3799999999999
don't hear you talking about it

1099.39 --> 1107.23
all right well Lottie

1102.19 --> 1114.24
I know you were joking and I put the

1107.23 --> 1114.24
joke on you don't be a baby about it

1118.0 --> 1121.25
[Music]

1134.059 --> 1150.32
ah right Dave Johnson hmm coffees and

1142.039 --> 1153.649
M&Ms that seems like a lot of a lot of

1150.32 --> 1156.229
upper chemistry up in chemistry be

1153.649 --> 1158.57
careful I personally don't like

1156.229 --> 1161.8590000000002
combining chocolate and coffee it's like

1158.57 --> 1161.859
too much in the same direction

1167.39 --> 1175.8400000000001
right anyway anybody can of course enjoy

1172.07 --> 1178.4289999999999
whatever they like just know that

1175.84 --> 1183.29
everything you eat every single thing

1178.429 --> 1185.75
has consequences little a lot you don't

1183.29 --> 1189.559
exactly know how old turn out but you

1185.75 --> 1191.27
could potentially references to what

1189.559 --> 1194.809
you've seen with other people especially

1191.27 --> 1197.66
family if yes you might have family with

1194.809 --> 1203.23
the same type of physiology and you can

1197.66 --> 1206.21
deduce all kinds of approaches from that

1203.23 --> 1210.71
it's part of things that I've done like

1206.21 --> 1215.48
I've based a lot of my yeah the care

1210.71 --> 1217.19
that I try to take for my own body I've

1215.48 --> 1220.04
taken that pretty much from my mother

1217.19 --> 1222.41
because we seem to have the same kind of

1220.04 --> 1225.53
well she was very concerned about it as

1222.41 --> 1228.71
well and every time she did bypass it

1225.53 --> 1231.41
and not ignore ignore it and all that it

1228.71 --> 1236.99
would have just measurable consequence

1231.41 --> 1240.28
visible consequences and weirdly enough

1236.99 --> 1244.49
I started to accept that being normal

1240.28 --> 1246.8799999999999
before I really got to know how other

1244.49 --> 1251.929
people were in in the rest of the world

1246.88 --> 1256.7900000000002
so it's only now that I realized okay

1251.929 --> 1259.48
that's like a characteristic that not

1256.79 --> 1259.48
everybody has

1263.899 --> 1267.84
all right now trekking her Stefan

1266.399 --> 1269.5189999999998
Alderson I don't really know what

1267.84 --> 1272.519
rust-eze doing I haven't heard from him

1269.519 --> 1279.499
in a while although the guy has a pretty

1272.519 --> 1279.499
elaborate life so I don't know

1288.21 --> 1293.749
you know

1290.69 --> 1296.45
it could be that basically the data did

1293.749 --> 1299.479
get lost he really did some heavy

1296.45 --> 1301.6390000000001
digging that's what I know it could be

1299.479 --> 1307.6090000000002
that it just he couldn't find it anymore

1301.639 --> 1311.32
because it was gone and yeah it was it

1307.609 --> 1311.32
was just nitpicking anyway

1311.65 --> 1314.789
[Music]

1316.88 --> 1324.38
yeah well Trish Blythe you know that

1320.19 --> 1327.21
evidence for that one thing which is so

1324.38 --> 1331.98
overemphasized just that one freakin

1327.21 --> 1334.95
point I don't know I wasn't there all I

1331.98 --> 1337.92
know is that everything outside of that

1334.95 --> 1340.8600000000001
and your overall claims that you made

1337.92 --> 1347.1200000000001
the overall points that you sided with

1340.86 --> 1349.4399999999998
at times people you condone in

1347.12 --> 1354.1799999999998
circumstances all of that combined shows

1349.44 --> 1359.0700000000002
me that there's abundance of evidence

1354.18 --> 1361.0800000000002
that you're nuts and I can't trust a

1359.07 --> 1367.6499999999999
single word you say and in there any

1361.08 --> 1372.21
circumstance so this is just an act it's

1367.65 --> 1375.8400000000001
just theater drama now from Trish just

1372.21 --> 1377.73
to try to leave an imprint of something

1375.84 --> 1379.32
that's an actual person instead of

1377.73 --> 1381.68
somebody's just completely out of

1379.32 --> 1381.6799999999998
control

1383.9 --> 1390.26
yeah anyway that's my angle two things

1401.8 --> 1405.24
[Music]

1408.85 --> 1420.519
Oh No yeah I almost forgot about that

1415.029 --> 1424.36
one peanuts Clark yeah although I pretty

1420.519 --> 1428.11
much abandoned her original claim of

1424.36 --> 1430.029
being a Christian pretty quickly so it's

1428.11 --> 1431.9799999999998
almost like in the past I forget

1430.029 --> 1440.58
oh yeah right that's also a claim that

1431.98 --> 1440.58
she yeah that was definitely false

1448.03 --> 1457.45
oh my god Trish yeah rage rate so much

1452.56 --> 1460.54
rage man I don't think I've even raised

1457.45 --> 1469.0
my voice more than five percent even

1460.54 --> 1474.07
once during this entire show so far well

1469.0 --> 1478.24
Laurie lefty aho I believe you being a

1474.07 --> 1482.95
Christian over Trish Blythe being a

1478.24 --> 1487.98
Christian because even Christians can

1482.95 --> 1491.89
make mistakes or big mistakes but

1487.98 --> 1495.07
they're never that yeah not that far

1491.89 --> 1505.15
not that chronically and you have your

1495.07 --> 1508.8999999999999
moments although you have to ruin it of

1505.15 --> 1517.69
course immediately that that's all fine

1508.9 --> 1520.75
look I don't really mind I just I accept

1517.69 --> 1525.03
people when they act nice and I reject

1520.75 --> 1525.03
them when they are acting like dick

1538.46 --> 1543.309
all right see you later Fyodor

1540.919 --> 1543.3090000000002
Dostoevsky

1548.99 --> 1554.14
Chris laingen who's that

1562.96 --> 1566.6100000000001
I had a Christian okay

1579.79 --> 1586.85
okay I don't know if that's anything

1584.12 --> 1589.12
Christian related at all but whatever

1586.85 --> 1589.12
man

1621.34 --> 1631.899
oh right so any more thoughts about my

1629.169 --> 1642.009
remarks concerning spatial non-linearity

1631.899 --> 1648.6899999999998
and now the loop could be I say not

1642.009 --> 1652.029
perpendicular like loop could be slanted

1648.69 --> 1654.419
anybody consider that a regular loop how

1652.029 --> 1654.419
that would work

1659.49 --> 1668.7
remember my earlier point about

1662.87 --> 1672.059
potentially altering the loop itself and

1668.7 --> 1677.8700000000001
therefore the the potential to close off

1672.059 --> 1677.87
realms remember that

1678.3 --> 1681.45
[Music]

1690.85 --> 1701.259
yeah you know I think at some point I'm

1695.009 --> 1705.13
probably just gonna take all the shows

1701.259 --> 1707.1390000000001
that I'd done all of it and basically go

1705.13 --> 1712.0
scrolling through them like speed

1707.139 --> 1714.6
reading and trying to get all the good

1712.0 --> 1717.639
statements I made that are consistent

1714.6 --> 1719.23
concerning the looping system and the

1717.639 --> 1721.769
realm and all that all the modeling and

1719.23 --> 1724.029
I'll put it into basically a script so

1721.769 --> 1726.84
extracting everything I said and putting

1724.029 --> 1732.82
it into a script and then refining it

1726.84 --> 1736.899
until it could make a a very strong

1732.82 --> 1739.509
presentation but yeah then there's the

1736.899 --> 1741.37
perfectionist aspect with my character

1739.509 --> 1744.179
that's why I like to improvise so much

1741.37 --> 1747.9089999999999
because when I improvise

1744.179 --> 1751.539
it just manifests and I can blame myself

1747.909 --> 1755.71
for not being perfect afterward if I

1751.539 --> 1757.179
build something then suddenly it's like

1755.71 --> 1758.8890000000001
oh wait could I do this better

1757.179 --> 1763.24
Oh God but what about this what about

1758.889 --> 1766.899
that what about that yeah but yeah

1763.24 --> 1768.909
concerning the model it seems like I'm

1766.899 --> 1771.7299999999998
learning a lot and I'm putting it out

1768.909 --> 1774.779
there a lot of you people you're just

1771.73 --> 1777.85
looking at it and like seeing like hmm

1774.779 --> 1780.82
Elma seems sometimes like everything I'm

1777.85 --> 1784.9189999999999
talking about that's more complex the

1780.82 --> 1787.389
real it must sound like science fiction

1784.919 --> 1791.919
thinking like a lot of you too a lot of

1787.389 --> 1793.899
you it almost feels like you guys get

1791.919 --> 1798.8990000000001
the feeling like you're watching it like

1793.899 --> 1802.09
some kind of modern art expedition

1798.899 --> 1805.6899999999998
because I get so a little feedback that

1802.09 --> 1810.4599999999998
actually proves to me that you get what

1805.69 --> 1812.799
I'm talking about so I just because of

1810.46 --> 1815.23
this and because I've been talking about

1812.799 --> 1818.559
these things so many times now for such

1815.23 --> 1820.659
a long period I just feel like I have no

1818.559 --> 1823.47
other choice then to just condense it

1820.659 --> 1823.47
all to make a

1823.549 --> 1833.639
and even clear-cut confined image that's

1830.909 --> 1835.8300000000002
just very hard to misunderstand

1833.639 --> 1839.519
in some way design it like that but

1835.83 --> 1842.1899999999998
that's gonna be tough it's not something

1839.519 --> 1846.659
I just like oh yeah I technically might

1842.19 --> 1849.239
spend a week on that or something but

1846.659 --> 1852.69
it'll take a lot of time to let it

1849.239 --> 1855.719
process because if I hurry that up it's

1852.69 --> 1859.3690000000001
gonna be messy and I'd be forced to make

1855.719 --> 1864.239
a lot of updates after that I'd rather

1859.369 --> 1868.2189999999998
get it good right away oh goody

1864.239 --> 1868.219
really more more people

1872.4 --> 1884.22
oh goody look I'm used to it

1877.26 --> 1887.61
you know discman the guy he's a maniac

1884.22 --> 1892.8600000000001
anyway like he's just a total liar

1887.61 --> 1895.2299999999998
shameless monster if this is the same

1892.86 --> 1899.1299999999999
Vincent that I think you're talking

1895.23 --> 1901.53
about and I don't know there's more of

1899.13 --> 1904.95
these people that I just recognized

1901.53 --> 1907.47
early on with my senses that they were

1904.95 --> 1912.45
hiding something deeper and just you

1907.47 --> 1916.19
can't fool me with that [ __ ] I've been

1912.45 --> 1919.44
exposed to some messed up people and

1916.19 --> 1923.63
that forces your instincts to get these

1919.44 --> 1928.77
things right you can't hide it

1923.63 --> 1931.98
not really giggle thinking very quickly

1928.77 --> 1934.429
so but yeah because we're now there's

1931.98 --> 1938.1200000000001
just multiple people out there just

1934.429 --> 1941.3400000000001
heylia Darwin spending time in their own

1938.12 --> 1945.2399999999998
endeavors whatever focusing then their

1941.34 --> 1948.9289999999999
time um like why are one is such a bad

1945.24 --> 1952.08
person or a lunatic or just a parasite

1948.929 --> 1954.3000000000002
of some kind my joblessness and all that

1952.08 --> 1957.23
and like oh my god is just an

1954.3 --> 1964.35
abomination he must be stopped

1957.23 --> 1967.7
somehow the deaths just be did the sense

1964.35 --> 1971.28
that I get although in another way I

1967.7 --> 1973.3500000000001
think just most people will rather see

1971.28 --> 1976.1399999999999
it but that's like the weird part for me

1973.35 --> 1979.8
that the most people will probably just

1976.14 --> 1983.0400000000002
recognize it as jealousy but there's the

1979.8 --> 1985.8
weird twist I can't imagine this like

1983.04 --> 1992.7
what's really somebody's jealous of me

1985.8 --> 1996.03
really I seriously can't imagine it

1992.7 --> 2001.3400000000001
seriously not like I am proud of the

1996.03 --> 2004.1299999999999
things of certain elements about me but

2001.34 --> 2005.6599999999999
at the same time I feel yeah in a way

2004.13 --> 2011.21
incomplete as well

2005.66 --> 2013.7
and just and other people feel different

2011.21 --> 2015.47
I could compare it just what I feel

2013.7 --> 2021.2
inside is different from what other

2015.47 --> 2025.28
people tend to carry and I don't think

2021.2 --> 2027.26
anybody if they'd really got me that

2025.28 --> 2029.93
they would be jealous everybody that

2027.26 --> 2033.47
really knows me that I'm like very close

2029.93 --> 2037.45
friends they're not jealous of me nobody

2033.47 --> 2040.88
that really gets me is jealous of me

2037.45 --> 2043.8500000000001
cuz there's no sense in being that it

2040.88 --> 2047.0600000000002
that would be it's like idealizing

2043.85 --> 2050.0499999999997
certain aspects that you might may find

2047.06 --> 2052.879
admirable without realizing that they're

2050.05 --> 2056.78
intricately connected to the flaws that

2052.879 --> 2059.419
I possess as well and that's one of the

2056.78 --> 2064.28
main points that have been trying to get

2059.419 --> 2067.31
across in general and that is that all

2064.28 --> 2069.9190000000003
the talents and and strengths that you

2067.31 --> 2074.21
have the more you half of them the more

2069.919 --> 2077.0899999999997
you have to deal with and the more you

2074.21 --> 2082.79
see the more burden you get of what you

2077.09 --> 2089.2400000000002
see and it's just seeing a lot or being

2082.79 --> 2092.32
smart is just not that great it's there

2089.24 --> 2098.5099999999998
may be admirable things coming from it

2092.32 --> 2104.2000000000003
but that's just one face of it that's

2098.51 --> 2104.2000000000003
what I'm trying to it's like really

2104.7 --> 2110.009
it's jealous of jelly okay right rates

2110.48 --> 2113.659
[Music]

2125.23 --> 2134.14
well maybe Dave Johnson I don't know

2129.03 --> 2137.6090000000004
maybe well I I Indian I really don't

2134.14 --> 2142.3289999999997
think so because there's plenty of ideas

2137.609 --> 2146.069
they're just not as detailed worked out

2142.329 --> 2149.319
as I have done with my conceptualization

2146.069 --> 2152.3089999999997
because as everybody was reaching for

2149.319 --> 2159.0099999999998
rough possibilities like infinite plain

2152.309 --> 2161.17
puddle things you know the the cap and

2159.01 --> 2164.44
with more stuff out of there there's so

2161.17 --> 2168.79
many approaches but they're all pretty

2164.44 --> 2172.349
superficial they're like short concepts

2168.79 --> 2175.27
to give a rough view a rough idea but

2172.349 --> 2180.4900000000002
not taken into account all the full

2175.27 --> 2185.23
consequences of matter and the laws of

2180.49 --> 2187.54
nature and all that so I just as

2185.23 --> 2189.94
everybody was throwing this out there

2187.54 --> 2192.099
say there was now two years ago three

2189.94 --> 2193.78
years ago already kind of and people are

2192.099 --> 2197.71
just throwing their concepts out of

2193.78 --> 2201.4300000000003
there I was just one of the first people

2197.71 --> 2204.579
that just see that see the

2201.43 --> 2207.79
simplification start working out start

2204.579 --> 2210.4
modeling the concept and and the funny

2207.79 --> 2212.14
thing is that is what ballers do as well

2210.4 --> 2215.579
there's just one problem with the

2212.14 --> 2224.339
ballers they only do it with their model

2215.579 --> 2228.3390000000004
really so I can do that with anything

2224.339 --> 2230.38
just quickly puzzling the the model

2228.339 --> 2232.72
together with all the consequences and

2230.38 --> 2235.329
that's how I figured out like okay this

2232.72 --> 2237.6699999999996
thing doesn't work that thing things

2235.329 --> 2241.1800000000003
concerning infinity don't work okay what

2237.67 --> 2244.65
is left well either you'd have an egg

2241.18 --> 2247.1499999999996
yeah a snow globe type situation where

2244.65 --> 2248.829
there is nothing beyond the snow globe

2247.15 --> 2251.7400000000002
it's literally just the shape of the

2248.829 --> 2255.46
confine or you have a looping realm

2251.74 --> 2257.9799999999996
situation where suddenly it becomes a

2255.46 --> 2258.53
lot more complex but also with more

2257.98 --> 2261.32
pasta

2258.53 --> 2265.76
abilities and more possibilities just

2261.32 --> 2273.02
seemed like the right thing to do if you

2265.76 --> 2278.1800000000003
want to be an admirable creation it's

2273.02 --> 2281.09
just that's always been my standpoint

2278.18 --> 2284.87
look if the Creator if creation could

2281.09 --> 2287.75
allow this to manifest why would it not

2284.87 --> 2291.5299999999997
choose it over another option that would

2287.75 --> 2294.43
be more confined so it is basically a

2291.53 --> 2298.61
creation philosophical approach as a

2294.43 --> 2300.95
designer from the spirit of the designer

2298.61 --> 2309.83
is basically what I'm trying to look at

2300.95 --> 2313.73
it in that frequency and yeah that's why

2309.83 --> 2316.88
I stuck to that specific concept with

2313.73 --> 2319.13
the looping because just from the start

2316.88 --> 2321.98
as soon as I started talking about

2319.13 --> 2326.33
looping it's just people started to go

2321.98 --> 2329.44
loopy people start to go nuts with just

2326.33 --> 2333.68
the word just the concept and just see

2329.44 --> 2337.91
just literally going nuts like acting

2333.68 --> 2339.8599999999997
like imbeciles with it and yeah that

2337.91 --> 2342.5
wasn't very encouraging it was very

2339.86 --> 2345.65
worrying to me because I noticed that

2342.5 --> 2351.76
even the more regular flat-earthers that

2345.65 --> 2358.94
were around for a while had ball baller

2351.76 --> 2362.4500000000003
like subconscious responses it felt very

2358.94 --> 2365.33
much just like the ballers would respond

2362.45 --> 2368.18
to when you talk about anything Flat

2365.33 --> 2373.58
Earth and they gave that response to it

2368.18 --> 2377.44
at first like they didn't like it or

2373.58 --> 2377.44
they thought it was stupid or

2377.799 --> 2383.21
but yeah I just thought look okay I

2381.38 --> 2384.92
guess it just takes some more time I'm

2383.21 --> 2387.859
just gonna have to approach it as a

2384.92 --> 2391.91
science fiction concept and then as I

2387.859 --> 2396.7
refine it as that it is that basically

2391.91 --> 2400.8489999999997
my looping model concept could anyway be

2396.7 --> 2404.66
compared to pseudo Ramon Ian for space

2400.849 --> 2407.96
although that is more focused on yeah

2404.66 --> 2410.8289999999997
molding time and space elements together

2407.96 --> 2413.869
that's not what I'm concerned with in my

2410.829 --> 2416.96
model concept I'm pretty much just

2413.869 --> 2424.759
concerned with space itself

2416.96 --> 2426.079
it's space focused only but yeah I'm

2424.759 --> 2429.71
just working on it as a

2426.079 --> 2434.119
conceptualization as it as a viable

2429.71 --> 2436.69
science fiction concept and it is very

2434.119 --> 2438.65
much also you can adapt the

2436.69 --> 2440.509
conceptualization of it for many things

2438.65 --> 2443.96
it already kind of has happened it's

2440.509 --> 2446.239
just endeavour probably has been thought

2443.96 --> 2450.079
about a lot it's just that I think it

2446.239 --> 2453.369
has viability for the actual realm

2450.079 --> 2457.2200000000003
itself and there are ways to figure out

2453.369 --> 2458.7200000000003
the testing to test the looping concept

2457.22 --> 2461.2389999999996
that's the interesting thing about it

2458.72 --> 2465.89
and add it that could also definitely

2461.239 --> 2469.569
turn out to be just wrong you know like

2465.89 --> 2474.71
Fineman says if experimentation

2469.569 --> 2478.3089999999997
disagrees with scientific theory or with

2474.71 --> 2483.98
X what is it with theory in general it's

2478.309 --> 2486.7690000000002
wrong and that is I'm also been nervous

2483.98 --> 2488.63
about the looping concept because it

2486.769 --> 2492.4399999999996
could turn out to be just science

2488.63 --> 2495.559
fiction but it's testable I've

2492.44 --> 2499.239
conceptualized ways of testing it I'm

2495.559 --> 2499.239
just very curious about that

2502.96 --> 2509.3
yeah wouldn't it just be the next step

2507.65 --> 2518.77
to discover that there's a looping

2509.3 --> 2521.9
aspect to the realm it's just special

2518.77 --> 2525.609
non-linearity subtly is a could be a

2521.9 --> 2529.369
real thing how amazing would that be and

2525.609 --> 2533.54
then we no longer have certainty even as

2529.369 --> 2537.17
to what this manifestation really is we

2533.54 --> 2539.96
are at I think that the simulation

2537.17 --> 2542.89
theory would become vastly popularized

2539.96 --> 2547.04
because of it that might even become

2542.89 --> 2549.23
yeah come like real matrix cultish

2547.04 --> 2551.66
figures out of it since wouldn't be

2549.23 --> 2553.88
surprised that they would just accept

2551.66 --> 2557.8399999999997
absolutely that it's all a simulation

2553.88 --> 2561.609
and with whatever consequences that come

2557.84 --> 2564.7400000000002
with it could go in several directions

2561.609 --> 2567.17
all the pattern demand depends on what

2564.74 --> 2573.16
type of character philosophy they're

2567.17 --> 2573.16
gonna stick to for themselves but

2576.4 --> 2582.9990000000003
I think it is a serious viable option

2579.789 --> 2584.8900000000003
for reality and it doesn't mean I've

2582.999 --> 2588.73
always emphasized that it isn't a

2584.89 --> 2594.279
simulation this realm is not not real it

2588.73 --> 2602.039
may be not real to other dimensional

2594.279 --> 2605.799
aspects of ourselves that many

2602.039 --> 2608.5890000000004
encounters with with extra dimensional

2605.799 --> 2613.079
figures however you could interpret that

2608.589 --> 2616.39
during vision that claimed that that

2613.079 --> 2619.119
experience was reality and that the

2616.39 --> 2621.1189999999997
normal physical linear experience is not

2619.119 --> 2626.17
reality

2621.119 --> 2629.339
doesn't really help but in retrospect I

2626.17 --> 2629.339
don't think they were meant to help

2634.2 --> 2640.8999999999996
so I think that well if if the realm is

2638.59 --> 2645.07
looping then it means that there is

2640.9 --> 2648.9100000000003
simply a similar torii foundation to

2645.07 --> 2651.07
creation itself and that is why I've

2648.91 --> 2653.92
started using the word Cibola torii

2651.07 --> 2657.7000000000003
earlier on because people do respond oh

2653.92 --> 2660.4300000000003
it's do you mean it's a simulation it's

2657.7 --> 2662.4399999999996
not real it's just projecting their

2660.43 --> 2664.69
brains that are somewhere else in

2662.44 --> 2667.3
reality some kind of alternative

2664.69 --> 2671.98
physical reality God no I don't think

2667.3 --> 2680.55
that's the case at all I think that idea

2671.98 --> 2685.33
was a more like a remit a material

2680.55 --> 2689.3700000000003
reenactment of a part of the conscious

2685.33 --> 2698.14
process of pre life life and post life

2689.37 --> 2701.41
experience so it plays into that

2698.14 --> 2706.74
experience that is tends to be forgotten

2701.41 --> 2706.74
because of because of earthly influences

2709.14 --> 2713.37
yeah but anyway

2716.92 --> 2719.92
yeah

2726.0 --> 2733.34
really have to tell you what a loop is

2730.19 --> 2733.34
come on

2748.26 --> 2753.5400000000004
yeah that's ridiculous Dave Johnson the

2752.01 --> 2755.28
only way to prove your exist

2753.54 --> 2759.96
scientifically is by ending your

2755.28 --> 2762.78
existence that's ridiculous because that

2759.96 --> 2765.859
are you gotta manipulate you existing

2762.78 --> 2765.8590000000004
that's stupid

2799.329 --> 2808.13
well they've rakia gaffur if I think

2803.679 --> 2813.469
let's just say it like this if this is a

2808.13 --> 2817.579
simulation and that means not real but

2813.469 --> 2821.839
purely make-believe artificial in some

2817.579 --> 2824.8390000000004
way which means flexible also then that

2821.839 --> 2827.929
could mean that if this is a literal

2824.839 --> 2829.869
simulation then we who says that this

2827.929 --> 2836.089
simulation has all the laws of nature

2829.869 --> 2840.4990000000003
installed and all that so if in a pure

2836.089 --> 2843.799
pure mental artificial simulation the

2840.499 --> 2847.509
earth could be a globe and outer space

2843.799 --> 2857.049
could be real and whatever however

2847.509 --> 2860.9
anyone wants yeah but in a actual num

2857.049 --> 2864.169
simulation a similar Tori natured

2860.9 --> 2866.329
creation as I think we are in that is

2864.169 --> 2868.8089999999997
just the physical impossibility no

2866.329 --> 2868.809
matter what

2885.67 --> 2888.789
[Music]

2898.089 --> 2905.2
don't talk to me like that

2900.32 --> 2908.089
Ragnar Stefan held us and please I spent

2905.2 --> 2914.68
plenty of time on the moon you don't

2908.089 --> 2914.68
need to talk to me like that

2946.35 --> 2957.64
[Music]

2965.17 --> 2974.08
[Music]

2980.42 --> 2983.53
[Music]

2997.51 --> 3005.4700000000003
sorry I overlooked your question there

3000.51 --> 3008.38
Ali B if it is a simulation what is it

3005.47 --> 3013.39
simulating I don't know a physical

3008.38 --> 3014.7000000000003
reality or physical reality alike but

3013.39 --> 3019.8399999999997
[Music]

3014.7 --> 3022.3799999999997
yeah if it is a simulation is not my my

3019.84 --> 3025.38
argument because I disagree with that

3022.38 --> 3025.38
fundamentally

3027.14 --> 3030.23
[Music]

3048.21 --> 3054.13
[Music]

3072.799 --> 3081.079
now Dave Johnson the earth is a test

3082.189 --> 3091.709
it's not a training ground it's only a

3085.349 --> 3095.339
test because in the afterlife and in the

3091.709 --> 3098.939
free life you are flawed yeah you are

3095.339 --> 3103.349
like with God as it were with the source

3098.939 --> 3108.569
and everything you experience there is

3103.349 --> 3112.9100000000003
pure but when we go here to earth we are

3108.569 --> 3116.429
burdened with earthly burdens and and

3112.91 --> 3124.249
the darkness to contend with so this is

3116.429 --> 3124.2490000000003
all of this is is a test all of it

3127.19 --> 3130.81
why don't you believe it or not

3139.84 --> 3146.8900000000003
well spare-room music you could look

3142.72 --> 3153.8799999999997
what is an afterlife I'm pretty sure

3146.89 --> 3158.3799999999997
that whatever precedes and proceeds life

3153.88 --> 3162.1
is nothing like life so is there an

3158.38 --> 3165.58
afterlife there's an after pretty sure

3162.1 --> 3169.96
about that as there is it before but is

3165.58 --> 3172.0299999999997
it life I don't think it is I think that

3169.96 --> 3177.81
this condition that we experience is

3172.03 --> 3177.8100000000004
pretty damn unique it's very unique

3199.71 --> 3208.289
yeah sure of that

3202.089 --> 3214.569
mercury m7 I know about the heliocentric

3208.289 --> 3221.4100000000003
approaches to try to reintroduce a

3214.569 --> 3224.16
creator as a earthly or well extra

3221.41 --> 3224.16
earthly being

3233.7 --> 3240.54
[Music]

3234.9 --> 3240.54
and Anunnaki are basically in my opinion

3241.5 --> 3254.26
the heliocentric version of the Nephilim

3245.8 --> 3264.4300000000003
or not or not the Nephilim wait now are

3254.26 --> 3271.36
the Nephilim came forth that that's the

3264.43 --> 3273.66
Giants and all that know them the Elohim

3271.36 --> 3279.07
yeah that's the one

3273.66 --> 3281.31
so I think that yeah these aliens that

3279.07 --> 3286.11
recreated humanity and all that

3281.31 --> 3292.71
supposedly they are the heliocentric

3286.11 --> 3296.2000000000003
recreation of the Elohim of that concept

3292.71 --> 3299.26
their version within their mythology

3296.2 --> 3302.0099999999998
there other they're reversed world

3299.26 --> 3302.01
mythology

3302.88 --> 3305.989
[Music]

3308.33 --> 3317.09
I don't think Egypt is real

3312.17 --> 3320.69
I think Egypt is a pretty modern

3317.09 --> 3323.15
mythology most of it that coincide with

3320.69 --> 3329.54
the Roman Empire with most of it is

3323.15 --> 3332.87
probably also mythology I think that the

3329.54 --> 3337.69
Egypt pyramids were part of the original

3332.87 --> 3340.4
Atlantean Empire before the flood and

3337.69 --> 3343.27
whatever people settled there afterward

3340.4 --> 3346.28
they just used these things maybe

3343.27 --> 3349.24
back-engineered some of it to make up

3346.28 --> 3349.2400000000002
their own mythology

3357.759 --> 3364.989
hmm yeah I know history books are full

3361.88 --> 3364.989
of that [ __ ]

3370.28 --> 3376.07
I have my strong strong doubts about it

3372.94 --> 3376.07
[Music]

3384.67 --> 3390.32
which in a way is very tough on me

3387.05 --> 3395.42
because I used to be a great history fan

3390.32 --> 3397.79
and in history yeah Egypt Rome that is

3395.42 --> 3402.64
typically the type of subject you get to

3397.79 --> 3406.34
study with history and it did read about

3402.64 --> 3408.2
did read a lot about it I do know some

3406.34 --> 3414.6800000000003
of the things that were supposedly going

3408.2 --> 3417.109
on I just have my doubts about not

3414.68 --> 3419.8689999999997
necessarily even certain situations but

3417.109 --> 3423.0499999999997
rather like the moment in time and in

3419.869 --> 3426.07
the overall situation I just think a lot

3423.05 --> 3430.84
of it is just reengineering it's just

3426.07 --> 3435.849
cut apart and made into a new story

3430.84 --> 3435.849
that's what I think that most of it is

3445.53 --> 3449.0690000000004
[Music]

3458.22 --> 3465.7889999999998
well look Sparrow music if you're gonna

3461.799 --> 3467.619
argue that ancient Egypt predates the

3465.789 --> 3471.5490000000004
flood that would mean that it would be

3467.619 --> 3475.4990000000003
that region's part of the Atlantean

3471.549 --> 3479.769
Empire and anything that is kind of

3475.499 --> 3485.109
suggested about ancient Egypt and like

3479.769 --> 3488.43
the the semi-humanoid god creatures and

3485.109 --> 3492.7
all that all that thing well who knows

3488.43 --> 3495.339
maybe that was what this region of the

3492.7 --> 3498.819
Atlantean empire was doing at the time

3495.339 --> 3501.009
that even caused the flood all together

3498.819 --> 3505.48
not just them specifically but what

3501.009 --> 3509.98
everybody was doing so maybe in a way it

3505.48 --> 3513.22
is lent from things that are from the

3509.98 --> 3517.109
Atlantean times but whatever they made

3513.22 --> 3520.2099999999996
of it in the post-flood world that is a

3517.109 --> 3524.88
separated self containing story built

3520.21 --> 3524.88
with elements that are in the region

3546.44 --> 3550.409
yeah

3547.32 --> 3550.409
[Music]

3553.51 --> 3562.6090000000004
let's think of it like this if the

3560.0 --> 3569.72
history of something say a region or a

3562.609 --> 3573.109
country is real then the in my personal

3569.72 --> 3575.9599999999996
experience based opinion and that's not

3573.109 --> 3577.94
going to be based on historical

3575.96 --> 3581.7200000000003
researchers or anything it's just my

3577.94 --> 3585.76
intuitive approach to it is that if it's

3581.72 --> 3590.0499999999997
not widespread interconnected with other

3585.76 --> 3592.4900000000002
empires other countries other people's

3590.05 --> 3595.9100000000003
opponents all that if that is not part

3592.49 --> 3598.45
of it all then it's probably not real

3595.91 --> 3601.3999999999996
then it's probably a from scratch

3598.45 --> 3604.2799999999997
recreation to cover up all kinds of

3601.4 --> 3606.35
dirty [ __ ] that yeah none of the

3604.28 --> 3608.8300000000004
founders of it wanted anyone to remember

3606.35 --> 3608.83
about

3613.62 --> 3616.71
[Music]

3619.86 --> 3623.3
[Music]

3630.24 --> 3636.6299999999997
yeah but mercury m7 look you're talking

3634.14 --> 3639.95
about the times of Jesus now and

3636.63 --> 3642.589
everything right with that Egypt that is

3639.95 --> 3648.0299999999997
post flood Egypt

3642.589 --> 3649.5299999999997
that's just humans that's what they made

3648.03 --> 3652.38
that's exactly what I'm talking about

3649.53 --> 3655.71
that's what they made the locals made it

3652.38 --> 3658.7400000000002
into made it into a priesthood mysticism

3655.71 --> 3662.2400000000002
based priesthood that's what they did

3658.74 --> 3666.0
that's not what the original Atlantis

3662.24 --> 3669.2599999999998
version was when when all the giant

3666.0 --> 3669.26
things were actually built

3675.93 --> 3679.1099999999997
[Music]

3697.13 --> 3699.73
what

3709.27 --> 3715.18
all right okay everybody so spiraling

3712.36 --> 3717.46
that's fine sure anyway I'm gonna round

3715.18 --> 3720.31
