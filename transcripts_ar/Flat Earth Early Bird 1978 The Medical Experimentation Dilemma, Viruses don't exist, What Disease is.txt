29.24 --> 37.239
this

30.06 --> 37.239
[Music]

54.28 --> 62.68
good morning welcome to Flat Earth early

58.079 --> 64.68
bird number 197 78 I'm your host Arwin

62.68 --> 67.159
and before I start the show please don't

64.68 --> 70.08000000000001
forget to share it on any platform you

67.159 --> 72.32000000000001
deem fit and if you haven't already

70.08 --> 74.6
subscribe to my channel hit the Bell

72.32 --> 77.479
notification so you know when I'm going

74.6 --> 80.03999999999999
live which is normally 2 p.m Amsterdam

77.479 --> 82.28
time every day and please also do

80.04 --> 84.47900000000001
support me through the PayPal and the

82.28 --> 86.119
patreon that would be much appreciate

84.479 --> 87.64
and I can always use the support so

86.119 --> 90.439
please keep it coming that would be

87.64 --> 93.43900000000001
great

90.439 --> 95.96
right so yeah starting very late today

93.439 --> 98.36
sorry about

95.96 --> 102.67999999999999
that just

98.36 --> 105.079
preoccupied weather today is very mixed

102.68 --> 105.07900000000001
lot of

105.119 --> 111.64
wind was sunnier a bit earlier but not

109.439 --> 111.63999999999999
right

112.52 --> 117.67999999999999
now big clouds going about

132.56 --> 137.599
all right so who knows what that is

134.92 --> 137.599
going to change

138.12 --> 142.48000000000002
into right hello LSG first in chat good

141.44 --> 149.92
to see

142.48 --> 149.92
you it is Saturday the 15th of June 2024

154.84 --> 159.20000000000002
temperature is 18°

159.84 --> 169.4
C 43% precipitation so there will be

163.56 --> 169.4
some rain no doubt humidity

171.44 --> 178.84
56% yeah 32 kilometer an hour wind so

175.599 --> 181.83999999999997
yeah quite a bit of wind as I said it

178.84 --> 181.84
was

187.68 --> 191.28
hello borders boy good to see

196.84 --> 199.84
you

204.239 --> 210.68
right I had a kind of late night last

207.319 --> 213.11999999999998
night and went took a shot were really

210.68 --> 216.239
late but I was just like no I'm just

213.12 --> 218.239
taking it I don't care how late it is I

216.239 --> 220.439
want to be refreshed in the morning even

218.239 --> 224.48000000000002
if I that means going to be a bit late

220.439 --> 224.48
because it's Saturday anyway and who

228.84 --> 231.84
cares

233.84 --> 240.159
right and before I started the show I

236.92 --> 242.92
actually watched Eric Dub's video

240.159 --> 242.92
is really

243.68 --> 250.0
intense this

245.84 --> 253.239
video of uh the Egyptian and Tibetan

250.0 --> 257.519
Book of the Dead really intense

253.239 --> 257.519
and from what he described I

259.68 --> 267.32
mean it reminds me a ton of my big

264.8 --> 267.32
Vision

267.4 --> 271.71999999999997
thing like a ton of it

274.759 --> 280.639
making me wonder like did I just go

277.4 --> 286.96
through that experience

280.639 --> 286.96000000000004
somehow yet woke up right

287.12 --> 292.56
after even though it seemed like an

290.08 --> 295.12
eternity I'm not sure I may have had

292.56 --> 298.12
that experience maybe it wasn't adjacent

295.12 --> 298.12
experience I'm not

298.639 --> 304.759
sure but it does make a lot of sense

301.24 --> 308.36
because I did think that I was

304.759 --> 308.36
dead when I was

313.28 --> 319.23999999999995
there so yeah that really basically uh

316.84 --> 322.479
put me back

319.24 --> 327.16
into thinking about my

322.479 --> 327.15999999999997
Visions from back then

331.56 --> 335.88
right so anyway how are you guys

358.639 --> 362.6
doing for

397.56 --> 404.08
right so yeah Alex Jones or Infowars

401.88 --> 407.96
might be shut down this

404.08 --> 411.24
weekend certainly a lot of hints at

407.96 --> 413.919
it we'll see what

411.24 --> 418.759
happens I kind of hope it it's not going

413.919 --> 420.19899999999996
to happen cuz despite all his flaws I

418.759 --> 422.879
really do

420.199 --> 424.8
appreciate all its flaws I do really

422.879 --> 427.759
appreciate Infowars have been following

424.8 --> 427.759
it for a long

429.479 --> 435.4
time it is my way of watching the

433.08 --> 437.28
news cuz I'm definitely not going to

435.4 --> 440.28
watch any mainstream

437.28 --> 440.28
news

441.32 --> 446.639
[Music]

442.68 --> 449.16
anyway you are riding a high daughters

446.639 --> 452.319
are going to high school after the

449.16 --> 452.319
summer break oh

452.8 --> 456.8
cool time flies

465.8 --> 468.8
yeah

472.72 --> 478.199
huh did you get any chance to see them

479.599 --> 483.52
hey Bill night sign good to see

489.12 --> 496.84000000000003
you all right so got some T coffee here

493.4 --> 499.23999999999995
looking forward to that I do feel very

496.84 --> 499.23999999999995
clear

499.71 --> 506.08
[Music]

501.44 --> 506.08
today and of course Illumina

508.87 --> 512.11
[Music]

526.88 --> 533.6
all right so yeah yesterday's early word

528.959 --> 538.1999999999999
stream was great it really was it's like

533.6 --> 538.2
such a multifaceted show

542.36 --> 547.399
and I

544.839 --> 550.6800000000001
was yeah it started out talking about

547.399 --> 552.16
Trolls but after that just went into met

550.68 --> 555.8389999999999
[Music]

552.16 --> 559.079
meteorology pressure systems and then

555.839 --> 559.0790000000001
like I was very proud

559.16 --> 563.8389999999999
about the gas pressure without the dis

562.04 --> 567.12
container

563.839 --> 570.8000000000001
discussion and

567.12 --> 573.32
the the experiment that test that I

570.8 --> 575.56
basically figured out for people to like

573.32 --> 578.1600000000001
get over this idea that some kind of gas

575.56 --> 581.399
pressure gradient that we have means

578.16 --> 584.0
that you can have an equally low or even

581.399 --> 586.48
lower gas

584.0 --> 589.24
pressure right next to the lower

586.48 --> 590.9590000000001
pressure Zone within the gas pressure

589.24 --> 593.32
gradient that is

590.959 --> 596.279
vast and that that would hold

593.32 --> 598.32
equilibrium which is what glob

596.279 --> 602.24
Believers

598.32 --> 604.6400000000001
and spur scho believes I don't know if

602.24 --> 607.0
he still believes that but I mean that

604.64 --> 610.3199999999999
used to be his

607.0 --> 610.32
argument no

611.06 --> 615.76
[Music]

613.44 --> 618.399
pressure and like yeah I'm very

615.76 --> 621.64
satisfied about that it's like a good

618.399 --> 625.64
piece of detailed Flat

621.64 --> 625.64
Earth logic

630.32 --> 637.0400000000001
weather systems prove that

632.35 --> 640.9590000000001
[Music]

637.04 --> 640.959
wrong prove what wrong

642.59 --> 648.799
[Music]

653.56 --> 660.4799999999999
LSG right I even like afterward had like

657.839 --> 662.1600000000001
a thought of like how I could like turn

660.48 --> 664.9590000000001
it into

662.16 --> 667.4399999999999
schematics basically explain like how

664.959 --> 672.279
the gradient is going

667.44 --> 674.0790000000001
to behave when opening it up opening up

672.279 --> 677.04
the system that provides for the gas

674.079 --> 679.8389999999999
pressure gradient into a bigger

677.04 --> 683.279
system that is of equal low pressure as

679.839 --> 686.2790000000001
the low pressure side of the gradiated

683.279 --> 686.279
system

703.079 --> 708.92
cuz like

704.959 --> 708.92
the the gradient

710.16 --> 714.279
distribution is going to be like it's

712.32 --> 717.12
going to always have to be a pressure

714.279 --> 719.76
balance between the lower pressure

717.12 --> 721.76
system that's going to end up with and

719.76 --> 725.48
the higher pressure system and they have

721.76 --> 728.56
to be in Balance so if a very wide low

725.48 --> 731.6
press system opens up to a gradiated

728.56 --> 733.92
system then suddenly the the gradient

731.6 --> 734.76
within the gradiated system is going to

733.92 --> 739.0
have

734.76 --> 743.519
to Red distribute itself to gradiate in

739.0 --> 743.519
accordance to the total volume

751.519 --> 757.12
because that's what a gradient is a

752.92 --> 760.519
gradient sets in after the closed

757.12 --> 763.68
system has found an equilibrium then

760.519 --> 765.9590000000001
gradient can set in depending on the

763.68 --> 768.959
well in this case presumed to be

765.959 --> 768.959
temperature

769.199 --> 776.399
influences right and I

772.68 --> 776.399
basically described it

776.68 --> 782.68
all like how how could you demonstrate

784.639 --> 788.72
that

786.16 --> 791.4399999999999
right you have a

788.72 --> 796.12
tanker aquarium or

791.44 --> 800.48
something very pressure durable

796.12 --> 804.04
tanker with gas in it a hot plate on the

800.48 --> 807.04
bottom and a cold plate at the top but

804.04 --> 811.04
with a hole that you can remotely

807.04 --> 814.36
open then you let that whole thing is in

811.04 --> 814.36
another much bigger

817.12 --> 823.24
tanker then you let

820.12 --> 824.9590000000001
the gas pressure gradiate within the

823.24 --> 828.0
aquarium

824.959 --> 830.1199999999999
tanker until there is a readout of a

828.0 --> 832.959
stable

830.12 --> 836.48
equilibrium of gradiation and then you

832.959 --> 840.3199999999999
take the lower pressure part at the cold

836.48 --> 844.0790000000001
side measure that

840.32 --> 848.12
and then you attune the greater chamber

844.079 --> 849.7199999999999
in which that is to become equal to that

848.12 --> 852.36
lower

849.72 --> 855.12
pressure at the cold side of the

852.36 --> 859.1990000000001
internal pressure

855.12 --> 861.759
chamber to become just exactly the same

859.199 --> 865.8389999999999
now there's a thing like how do you do

861.759 --> 868.5600000000001
that by Deep basically decompressing it

865.839 --> 871.1600000000001
or even by just introducing cold in the

868.56 --> 874.079
entire surrounding chamber and I wonder

871.16 --> 874.079
if that even

874.72 --> 882.0
matters whether do you just evacuate it

877.519 --> 886.079
or like create cold that it's all going

882.0 --> 889.199
to become lower pressure that way and be

886.079 --> 891.7199999999999
more easily

889.199 --> 895.4399999999999
evacuated but then when you open up a

891.72 --> 898.279
hole between the gradiated internal

895.44 --> 900.6
tanker to the bigger tanker with that it

898.279 --> 902.92
has the lower pressure pressure like

900.6 --> 905.399
doesn't matter if that lower pressure

902.92 --> 907.7199999999999
that surrounds it is equal to the lower

905.399 --> 910.92
pressure at the the cold side of the

907.72 --> 912.9200000000001
gradiated tank the entire thing is going

910.92 --> 917.279
to be

912.92 --> 919.8
like cut up into virtual squares as it

917.279 --> 922.639
were theoretically that are just going

919.8 --> 925.04
to succinctly in lock step with each

922.639 --> 926.839
other just together move like whether

925.04 --> 931.519
they're low pressure or higher pressure

926.839 --> 931.519
together move towards the exit

931.759 --> 937.0790000000001
hole to

934.319 --> 940.16
equalize with the larger tanker at that

937.079 --> 943.399
has the lower pressure outside of it and

940.16 --> 945.639
then once that's happened then a new

943.399 --> 948.279
gradiation might form which will be of

945.639 --> 948.279
much lower

953.279 --> 960.959
pressure proving that yeah the gas

957.44 --> 962.12
pressure is not just going to sit in an

960.959 --> 965.3599999999999
open

962.12 --> 968.12
container next to a much larger

965.36 --> 970.48
volume of lower pressure that's just not

968.12 --> 970.48
going to

972.36 --> 977.6
happen right and yeah anybody who would

974.8 --> 980.3599999999999
be willing to basically spend some money

977.6 --> 983.839
and time on on a setup like that can

980.36 --> 983.839
prove that

991.72 --> 995.399
what do you mean the gradient is

996.04 --> 1001.279
stationary constant Distributing well

998.959 --> 1004.56
it's a dynamic system

1001.279 --> 1007.199
LSG there's a constant influx of

1004.56 --> 1008.279
temperatures that cause that gradient

1007.199 --> 1012.8389999999999
and I

1008.279 --> 1017.92
mean the gradient is relatively

1012.839 --> 1020.519
stable I mean up there it doesn't just

1017.92 --> 1023.279
sometimes become equal pressure as here

1020.519 --> 1023.279
down at the

1023.559 --> 1029.439
ground but the pressure might

1026.48 --> 1031.959
vary like at the ground and I don't know

1029.439 --> 1033.8390000000002
how much it even varies up there does it

1031.959 --> 1037.199
vary up there or does it remain

1033.839 --> 1039.28
relatively stable at a low at that lower

1037.199 --> 1041.0790000000002
pressure doesn't seem to be a lot of

1039.28 --> 1043.9189999999999
things happening up

1041.079 --> 1046.9189999999999
there like all the real weather

1043.919 --> 1050.8400000000001
Dynamics tend to happen at the higher

1046.919 --> 1050.8400000000001
pressure Zone where the temperature is

1076.52 --> 1080.8799999999999
okay right anyway that was mostly

1079.24 --> 1084.1200000000001
yesterday

1080.88 --> 1086.6000000000001
show I mean I can continue talking on

1084.12 --> 1086.6
about it

1086.64 --> 1092.5590000000002
but only if there's Animo for that

1118.12 --> 1122.36
all right anyway take a sip of this

1124.7 --> 1130.96
[Music]

1126.96 --> 1130.96
coffee great

1156.28 --> 1162.48
oh yeah here's another weird thing

1158.52 --> 1165.1589999999999
apparently the WF is the that

1162.48 --> 1167.679
organization is apparently stopping

1165.159 --> 1169.6000000000001
archaeological diggings everywhere in

1167.679 --> 1171.44
the world

1169.6 --> 1173.3999999999999
that's a weird thing that I wouldn't

1171.44 --> 1176.4
that you wouldn't

1173.4 --> 1176.4
expect

1179.44 --> 1185.96
right are they trying to prevent us from

1182.96 --> 1189.44
figuring out our roots that we're going

1185.96 --> 1192.76
to perceive now not through the colored

1189.44 --> 1196.0800000000002
lens of any story that they will give

1192.76 --> 1198.32
with it as they always have right me

1196.08 --> 1201.08
every time oh we found something oh we

1198.32 --> 1204.8799999999999
found the Scrolls or we found

1201.08 --> 1207.52
the ancient SES and then they always

1204.88 --> 1209.5590000000002
give you the story with it well guess

1207.52 --> 1211.799
what there's so

1209.559 --> 1214.799
much

1211.799 --> 1214.799
decentralized

1214.88 --> 1220.919
non-approved digging and figuring out

1217.679 --> 1223.159
like intellectual digging in information

1220.919 --> 1226.0800000000002
that yeah if there's like new

1223.159 --> 1229.6000000000001
archaeological diggings like people are

1226.08 --> 1232.32
going to immediately unleash their new

1229.6 --> 1235.799
insights that aren't basically system

1232.32 --> 1237.52
approved onto that so in that sense it

1235.799 --> 1240.36
does make sense that they're stopping

1237.52 --> 1240.36
archaeological

1240.88 --> 1245.159
digs on the other hand it's like why

1243.4 --> 1248.76
would they even

1245.159 --> 1248.7600000000002
bother it's kind of

1257.159 --> 1263.7990000000002
strange no W is Bo nobody's

1260.28 --> 1265.84
banned and you're just summoning them by

1263.799 --> 1268.24
by calling out their names I mean aren't

1265.84 --> 1268.24
you

1274.559 --> 1281.0
glad it's like hey why aren't the demons

1277.4 --> 1283.039
here yeah isn't that just like worth

1281.0 --> 1286.039
celebrating like hey it's a piece of

1283.039 --> 1289.44
heaven oh what you immediately miss the

1286.039 --> 1291.12
demons not that I mean they

1289.44 --> 1294.559
well maybe they were a bit demon I don't

1291.12 --> 1294.559
know akum is not really

1296.44 --> 1299.64
demonic just

1311.559 --> 1318.0
barded all right I'm sure they'll find

1314.2 --> 1318.0
their way over here

1333.84 --> 1336.84
h

1366.84 --> 1374.1999999999998
H looks like some people out there are

1370.72 --> 1379.52
seeing the light it's about damn

1374.2 --> 1379.52
time just going to read a headline

1383.159 --> 1389.6000000000001
like fellow green peace

1387.18 --> 1393.24
[Music]

1389.6 --> 1395.559
founder co-founder Dr Patrick Moore

1393.24 --> 1398.72
admits that the green deal is basically

1395.559 --> 1401.6789999999999
a suicide pack for all of

1398.72 --> 1406.0
humanity there's a video of that going

1401.679 --> 1406.0
around on x

1409.24 --> 1413.44
and you can actually share that hold

1420.08 --> 1429.24
on what the no I don't want that post

1425.08 --> 1434.76
through another stupid ass website I

1429.24 --> 1434.76
just want the X poost what the hell man

1441.72 --> 1449.919
let see if I can get rid of that extra

1445.2 --> 1453.799
crap yeah that worked like

1449.919 --> 1456.5200000000002
why why do does the why does the

1453.799 --> 1460.0
previous website that's linking up to it

1456.52 --> 1463.799
need to be in the freaking hyperlink

1460.0 --> 1468.76
it's a ridiculous system

1463.799 --> 1468.76
anyway there's that expost

1470.48 --> 1474.1200000000001
and I mean when like people like that

1472.279 --> 1475.96
are starting to say it I mean they're

1474.12 --> 1478.279
the progenitors of this thing they're

1475.96 --> 1483.3600000000001
the ones that have

1478.279 --> 1486.039
basically started doing that so kind of

1483.36 --> 1489.6
glad people like this need to come out

1486.039 --> 1489.6
and say that

1499.24 --> 1503.84
right so yeah you can check that out if

1501.559 --> 1503.84
you

1526.399 --> 1532.6789999999999
like some crazy ass

1529.48 --> 1535.799
story some guy from Boy Zone I still

1532.679 --> 1538.0
remember that and how freaking gay that

1535.799 --> 1541.44
was but

1538.0 --> 1545.2
whatever this guy Shane Lynch just came

1541.44 --> 1549.3990000000001
out selling us oh this satanic music

1545.2 --> 1552.279
industry like yeah duh but I mean he

1549.399 --> 1556.1589999999999
basically shared that they have these

1552.279 --> 1559.44
weird people that like do demonic

1556.159 --> 1561.64
prayers over these songs

1559.44 --> 1565.159
like what the

1561.64 --> 1567.96
[ __ ] though when you think it wasn't

1565.159 --> 1567.96
crazy enough

1568.72 --> 1575.24
already yeah some of you might have like

1571.08 --> 1577.9189999999999
bumped into messages like that out there

1575.24 --> 1577.919
or maybe you

1580.2 --> 1584.559
didn't that was weird

1618.08 --> 1624.96
oh right so anyway that's the

1621.52 --> 1628.08
news the very short news flashes that I

1624.96 --> 1630.48
do have on my show sometimes I share

1628.08 --> 1632.6399999999999
some stuff a lot of the times I don't

1630.48 --> 1637.679
really share it because

1632.64 --> 1637.679
just annoying politics related

1647.159 --> 1651.159
stuff for

1679.94 --> 1683.059
[Music]

1695.84 --> 1700.72
all right so since nobody's talking

1698.48 --> 1700.72
right

1702.679 --> 1709.919
now I'm just going to start eating my

1705.039 --> 1709.919
Illuminati Kasam then cheers

1763.44 --> 1768.48
so yeah I'm open for questions

1772.36 --> 1774.7199999999998
about

1778.679 --> 1787.64
anything except for pointless factoids

1782.76 --> 1787.64
that don't bring any insight to

1797.039 --> 1801.0
anything for

1829.6 --> 1833.799
right in the meantime please don't

1831.2 --> 1837.519
forget to Rogan it

1833.799 --> 1837.519
up and share the

1837.6 --> 1844.6
show and I can still use the support I

1840.76 --> 1844.6
mean I've been asking for a

1846.919 --> 1854.3600000000001
while I know it's summertime so I'm

1849.84 --> 1854.36
shouldn't be expecting too much

1860.72 --> 1864.039
but I do actually need

1871.75 --> 1874.799
[Music]

1879.639 --> 1885.1999999999998
it I mean at least for like Illuminati

1882.72 --> 1888.559
croissant support I I really kind of do

1885.2 --> 1888.559
need that

1899.399 --> 1903.32
right just think of what I'm providing

1903.36 --> 1908.639
here stable platform is always here

1906.44 --> 1910.8400000000001
every day around the same time yeah I'm

1908.639 --> 1914.6
always a bit late but then again when I

1910.84 --> 1917.279
show up in time people don't even nobody

1914.6 --> 1919.0
shows up for like 40 minutes I mean

1917.279 --> 1921.32
that's not on coming out now it's of

1919.0 --> 1924.76
course

1921.32 --> 1928.519
summertime but uh yeah I do provide

1924.76 --> 1928.519
certain things

1928.559 --> 1932.96
here

1930.36 --> 1935.9599999999998
and anybody that isn't just the

1932.96 --> 1940.1200000000001
Shameless piece of garbage troll can

1935.96 --> 1945.1200000000001
just walk walk in here ask

1940.12 --> 1945.12
questions and have a place the chat

1957.6 --> 1964.0
so by all means say something in the

1961.0 --> 1964.0
chat

2004.88 --> 2009.7600000000002
wait what you didn't get a high I did

2006.72 --> 2009.76
say hello clutch

2020.0 --> 2029.399
what oh it's good to see

2023.72 --> 2029.3990000000001
you didn't I call call out your name

2036.24 --> 2042.279
huh I mean I might have forgotten I was

2039.12 --> 2047.039
like in the middle of talking and laying

2042.279 --> 2047.039
down a summary of the news as it

2066.72 --> 2069.72
were

2096.64 --> 2099.64
for

2126.64 --> 2130.68
for for

2140.49 --> 2143.7799999999997
[Music]

2216.52 --> 2220.56
for for

2252.88 --> 2256.179
[Music]

2263.48 --> 2267.88
yeah by the

2264.68 --> 2271.04
way there's a lot of stories coming out

2267.88 --> 2273.6400000000003
I mean they have been for ages

2271.04 --> 2275.92
now but it's getting more

2273.64 --> 2278.8799999999997
attention stories of people that have

2275.92 --> 2281.92
participated in the medical

2278.88 --> 2283.2400000000002
experiment that by their stories it

2281.92 --> 2286.64
seems

2283.24 --> 2289.359
like they were basically put like for an

2286.64 --> 2291.52
ultimatum like you want to just have

2289.359 --> 2294.92
your career what you were

2291.52 --> 2297.7599999999998
doing then you need to do it otherwise

2294.92 --> 2297.76
you lose all

2299.76 --> 2304.8
that like is that coercion I I would

2303.359 --> 2309.44
like

2304.8 --> 2309.44
to ponder upon that

2310.839 --> 2317.4
cuz technically you you still have that

2314.2 --> 2322.0
choice I mean but it

2317.4 --> 2326.4
is is would it be fair to like call it

2322.0 --> 2331.8
an honest option if the option is do

2326.4 --> 2331.8
this thing or you lose a lot of what you

2333.76 --> 2338.0400000000004
had it's

2335.68 --> 2340.2
like participate

2338.04 --> 2343.8
or make a

2340.2 --> 2343.7999999999997
sacrifice is that

2343.839 --> 2347.119
coercion like

2348.16 --> 2353.7999999999997
legally this is a complicated

2351.16 --> 2356.16
question that a lot of people are facing

2353.8 --> 2356.1600000000003
now

2356.72 --> 2362.16
because from just a rudimentary logic

2359.839 --> 2364.68
perspective I was thought that like no

2362.16 --> 2367.64
they're not really forcing anybody not

2364.68 --> 2371.0
really no nobody's like actually saying

2367.64 --> 2373.2
like no and then they're like getting

2371.0 --> 2376.16
cornered and it's forced upon them maybe

2373.2 --> 2379.2799999999997
some handicapped people or

2376.16 --> 2382.3999999999996
whatever but they don't have authority

2379.28 --> 2386.28
over their own well-being

2382.4 --> 2386.28
anyway because that's how that's

2392.359 --> 2398.48
arranged but the thing is it's just a a

2396.319 --> 2402.16
giant

2398.48 --> 2404.76
trick because technically yeah those

2402.16 --> 2407.2799999999997
people that were supposedly

2404.76 --> 2409.76
coerced and would have lost their entire

2407.28 --> 2413.28
career if they didn't cooperate they

2409.76 --> 2415.119
should have then basically lost their

2413.28 --> 2418.48
entire career they should have just like

2415.119 --> 2418.48
made them fire

2422.2 --> 2428.8799999999997
them because if they had yeah their life

2426.319 --> 2431.599
would be a mess absolutely their life

2428.88 --> 2434.8
would be a mess they get into like

2431.599 --> 2436.599
mortgage problems all that crap like

2434.8 --> 2439.44
it's going to be a giant shitfest

2436.599 --> 2443.4
anytime that happens

2439.44 --> 2446.119
yes but then

2443.4 --> 2449.079
afterward they could have effectively

2446.119 --> 2452.28
sued for the

2449.079 --> 2454.88
damage yeah the effective damage that

2452.28 --> 2459.3590000000004
came out of the coercion

2454.88 --> 2464.599
process well giving in to it not

2459.359 --> 2464.5989999999997
temporarily losing your life set

2465.96 --> 2474.2
up can you then still sue for right for

2470.64 --> 2474.2
the Damage Done by the medical

2475.52 --> 2481.8
experiment and this just kind of like

2479.04 --> 2487.359
shows that it's kind of walking a fine

2481.8 --> 2491.52
line of voluntarism versus coercion

2487.359 --> 2491.52
because like yeah super

2492.4 --> 2497.319
technically like like a robot

2495.16 --> 2500.64
technically yeah they did have the

2497.319 --> 2504.16
option except who the hell like you have

2500.64 --> 2504.16
to be really

2504.56 --> 2511.52
like very far above average character

2508.0 --> 2514.28
strength to actually allow a system to

2511.52 --> 2517.2
basically punish you like that take away

2514.28 --> 2520.2400000000002
the stability of your life and all that

2517.2 --> 2523.839
in order to say no to something like

2520.24 --> 2527.56
that even though technically you did get

2523.839 --> 2530.6
the option so this is like a a a giant

2527.56 --> 2533.319
Guardian knot

2530.6 --> 2536.64
[Music]

2533.319 --> 2539.88
of vague territory it's like this gray

2536.64 --> 2542.0
area that's formed and a lot of people

2539.88 --> 2544.359
are stuck in that gray area and it's

2542.0 --> 2546.839
like Yeah from one side yeah they were

2544.359 --> 2547.7599999999998
coer on the other side well technically

2546.839 --> 2550.319
they

2547.76 --> 2552.6800000000003
warant what the [ __ ] are we going to do

2550.319 --> 2555.04
about and when I say we I don't mean me

2552.68 --> 2557.5589999999997
I mean all those people out there and

2555.04 --> 2559.359
there's there's going to be millions of

2557.559 --> 2564.079
them

2559.359 --> 2566.7999999999997
millions that are stuck in this gray

2564.079 --> 2569.0
area and they can't sue the medical

2566.8 --> 2570.7200000000003
companies CU they're

2569.0 --> 2572.559
all

2570.72 --> 2576.24
all

2572.559 --> 2579.559
like what do you protected legally

2576.24 --> 2583.0
protected by the state

2579.559 --> 2585.559
itself they just took the whole

2583.0 --> 2586.52
voluntarism system that's like if it

2585.559 --> 2589.1600000000003
wasn't

2586.52 --> 2591.68
volary then yeah those people can

2589.16 --> 2594.48
definitely sue the medical

2591.68 --> 2596.2
company but because they technically did

2594.48 --> 2599.68
have a choice and the choice would be

2596.2 --> 2603.7999999999997
well if you don't voluntarily do it

2599.68 --> 2603.7999999999997
then everything your life gets

2604.2 --> 2609.96
blocked

2605.76 --> 2609.96
but in a way that is

2610.359 --> 2618.24
coercion it's really difficult right now

2614.28 --> 2619.079
and it has to be resolved this basically

2618.24 --> 2622.839
this

2619.079 --> 2625.44
requires a a giant Think

2622.839 --> 2627.4
Tank I think that all these medical

2625.44 --> 2629.28
experiment damaged people that still

2627.4 --> 2632.2000000000003
have their faculties about and those

2629.28 --> 2633.96
that care for those people that surround

2632.2 --> 2635.64
them should like come together in a

2633.96 --> 2638.04
giant World

2635.64 --> 2640.4
Congress through the

2638.04 --> 2644.079
internet and

2640.4 --> 2644.079
really figure this

2645.88 --> 2651.7200000000003
out cuz they're literally stuck between

2649.2 --> 2654.72
a rock and a hard place in this

2651.72 --> 2654.72
predicament

2667.92 --> 2675.88
if they don't give confirmed

2670.68 --> 2678.2
consent say if you don't you can't work

2675.88 --> 2680.52
go to public places travel with that is

2678.2 --> 2685.7599999999998
forced no but it that isn't

2680.52 --> 2687.04
forced that's simply illegal clutch see

2685.76 --> 2691.3190000000004
it's not

2687.04 --> 2695.0
forced it's just an illegal

2691.319 --> 2697.599
threat it's power that's you could call

2695.0 --> 2700.76
that Force but those people could just

2697.599 --> 2704.76
say like oh so I'm going to be subjected

2700.76 --> 2708.6400000000003
to Illegal measures then constitutional

2704.76 --> 2708.6400000000003
violating measures that you're

2711.4 --> 2719.7200000000003
taking see the point is is that

2714.839 --> 2722.359
technically they could have taken the no

2719.72 --> 2724.48
position because afterward even though

2722.359 --> 2728.04
they would have societal damage

2724.48 --> 2731.88
Financial damage all that

2728.04 --> 2737.24
even isolation then they would have been

2731.88 --> 2740.48
able to have a recourse afterward sue

2737.24 --> 2743.3999999999996
them like oh you're firing me because

2740.48 --> 2745.04
I'm not participating in the medical

2743.4 --> 2750.04
experiment

2745.04 --> 2751.359
okay well then afterward I sue you

2750.04 --> 2756.839
because that's

2751.359 --> 2756.839
illegal but if you say yes

2757.599 --> 2759.96
no

2760.28 --> 2766.88
recourse so is that coercion when you

2764.28 --> 2768.079
literally have that option and it's a

2766.88 --> 2771.44
tough

2768.079 --> 2773.96
option but if you had just said no and

2771.44 --> 2775.68
then lost the job or whatever then

2773.96 --> 2777.88
afterward even though you'd have a

2775.68 --> 2780.7999999999997
tougher time to that you would be forced

2777.88 --> 2784.44
to go through you would have a legal

2780.8 --> 2787.92
recourse you would have been able to sue

2784.44 --> 2791.359
them for it they would probably

2787.92 --> 2795.2000000000003
feel forced to give you your job back

2791.359 --> 2798.0
with benefits and this has happened this

2795.2 --> 2801.7599999999998
has already been happening out there for

2798.0 --> 2804.2
people that did just say no no no no no

2801.76 --> 2806.559
no no matter what what you're going to

2804.2 --> 2808.9199999999996
kick me out of my Heist then well so be

2806.559 --> 2811.599
it I'm going to say no and then

2808.92 --> 2814.44
afterward after some of those things

2811.599 --> 2817.48
have happened now you have legal grounds

2814.44 --> 2821.079
to sue them which they did

2817.48 --> 2822.88
and then won that's already happened

2821.079 --> 2826.2400000000002
that's happened like over a year ago

2822.88 --> 2828.559
even I already saw the stories back then

2826.24 --> 2832.64
those people were smart

2828.559 --> 2837.079
enough but if you give into that sort of

2832.64 --> 2837.0789999999997
blackmail and you have no legal

2837.92 --> 2844.52
recourse the convenience of being able

2840.88 --> 2848.599
to continue on as you were seduced you

2844.52 --> 2851.4
into volunteering for

2848.599 --> 2854.76
something and after you do that you have

2851.4 --> 2857.76
no legal

2854.76 --> 2860.599
recourse so this is just a really

2857.76 --> 2864.0
complex situation that all these people

2860.599 --> 2868.1600000000003
have now ended up with and I do really

2864.0 --> 2872.839
sympathize it's it's super tragic it's

2868.16 --> 2876.52
like cosmically unfair in a way but this

2872.839 --> 2876.52
is what it is

2879.48 --> 2885.2
if you had said no and you'd lost your

2881.96 --> 2887.52
job you'd be kicked out of school you

2885.2 --> 2889.5589999999997
maybe lost your house or whatever

2887.52 --> 2892.92
terrible

2889.559 --> 2897.4
yeah but if you had just stuck to your

2892.92 --> 2900.2400000000002
guns there and taken the loss then

2897.4 --> 2905.559
afterward after that was over you would

2900.24 --> 2908.16
have had this ability to sue for damages

2905.559 --> 2911.44
that you would have very likely

2908.16 --> 2916.24
one it was like even said back then this

2911.44 --> 2919.04
is like at people were advised even in

2916.24 --> 2922.2
200 uh

2919.04 --> 2924.839
21 I've even talked about this kind of

2922.2 --> 2927.359
thing on my shows those shows were

2924.839 --> 2927.359
probably

2929.079 --> 2933.88
deleted as I was very frustrated and

2931.72 --> 2938.72
then start yelling like everybody's

2933.88 --> 2938.7200000000003
going to die because of this right

2939.28 --> 2942.92
but this is like this

2948.799 --> 2956.839
thing it's like they found a a way

2953.16 --> 2960.0789999999997
through the law like

2956.839 --> 2963.64
this dark way

2960.079 --> 2968.559
to to create an exception and like the

2963.64 --> 2972.4
law just can't do anything about it

2968.559 --> 2976.1600000000003
and it goes to show that Society really

2972.4 --> 2977.48
isn't all that stable that a situation

2976.16 --> 2980.2
like this could have

2977.48 --> 2983.4
transpired and that people that were

2980.2 --> 2986.16
just not strong enough to like go all

2983.4 --> 2988.799
the way through the fire in in their

2986.16 --> 2991.24
resistance that they basically lost

2988.799 --> 2994.319
everything because of this they kept

2991.24 --> 2998.16
their contemporary situation but then

2994.319 --> 2998.16
they lost their health

3000.44 --> 3008.119
and sometimes even their ability to to

3003.44 --> 3009.92
do their work for which they took it to

3008.119 --> 3011.839
be able to keep it and then they took it

3009.92 --> 3012.88
and then they lost the ability to even

3011.839 --> 3016.72
do that

3012.88 --> 3016.7200000000003
work it's totally

3024.48 --> 3029.76
insane right but this is how it's how it

3031.44 --> 3037.839
is and I just get this terrible noing

3035.079 --> 3040.6400000000003
feeling every time I see some something

3037.839 --> 3042.2
like this some item just like these

3040.64 --> 3044.1189999999997
people are in such a terrible

3042.2 --> 3045.72
predicament and there's like nothing

3044.119 --> 3050.119
they could

3045.72 --> 3053.5589999999997
do they're they're not going to be their

3050.119 --> 3055.6400000000003
situation is not going to be

3053.559 --> 3059.28
rectified it just

3055.64 --> 3059.2799999999997
won't it doesn't

3061.64 --> 3068.04
work they were

3064.96 --> 3072.48
effectively legally however absurd that

3068.04 --> 3072.48
sounds legally tricked into that

3072.52 --> 3078.2
position and it's super unfair it's

3075.24 --> 3081.319
super tragic but it just feels like

3078.2 --> 3081.319
there's nothing they can

3082.4 --> 3090.96
do except complain and just show them

3087.0 --> 3090.96
show the world the pain that has been

3095.599 --> 3100.799
caused and

3097.4 --> 3104.1600000000003
then people should Wonder like how could

3100.799 --> 3107.119
the society be this way that something

3104.16 --> 3108.68
like this could have been possible that

3107.119 --> 3110.92
a set of legal

3108.68 --> 3114.24
trickeries could have been put into

3110.92 --> 3117.4
place that put all these people millions

3114.24 --> 3120.4799999999996
of people potentially in this position

3117.4 --> 3123.0
position where they were tricked to

3120.48 --> 3124.92
participate in a medical experiment that

3123.0 --> 3129.44
not in their own

3124.92 --> 3132.599
interest just to keep their lives

3129.44 --> 3134.92
together and that when they gave into it

3132.599 --> 3138.7200000000003
just to maintain their life that they

3134.92 --> 3142.16
actually then permanently lose

3138.72 --> 3143.5989999999997
things including their life as it was

3142.16 --> 3146.2
and that there's nothing they can do

3143.599 --> 3148.52
about it or if they had resisted which

3146.2 --> 3152.1189999999997
is like like really tough and you just

3148.52 --> 3154.96
can't expect everybody to be that strong

3152.119 --> 3159.04
that they would have completely overcome

3154.96 --> 3161.52
it and had legal

3159.04 --> 3163.359
recourse cuz it's

3161.52 --> 3165.92
like the

3163.359 --> 3168.64
manipulation of like oh you're going to

3165.92 --> 3170.4
have to do this or lose it like that

3168.64 --> 3173.96
part was

3170.4 --> 3175.119
illegal but if you agree to taking the

3173.96 --> 3177.7200000000003
medical

3175.119 --> 3178.76
experiment then there's nothing you can

3177.72 --> 3182.5589999999997
do about

3178.76 --> 3182.559
it does this make any

3192.119 --> 3196.7200000000003
sense the origin of

3195.04 --> 3200.2
sickness

3196.72 --> 3203.8799999999997
what I think stage for more bow Warf

3200.2 --> 3203.8799999999997
there is no biowarfare

3208.92 --> 3215.0
yeah sickness is all due to a state of

3212.599 --> 3218.4
toxicity it's

3215.0 --> 3221.119
it's damage in the body that's getting

3218.4 --> 3225.64
repaired and sometimes the damage can't

3221.119 --> 3225.6400000000003
re be repaired and then the

3225.839 --> 3231.2799999999997
repairing

3227.4 --> 3234.92
State doesn't go away you become

3231.28 --> 3234.92
chronically ill

3236.559 --> 3241.76
yeah but there's there technically there

3238.2 --> 3245.16
is no biowarfare there is poison

3241.76 --> 3246.8390000000004
Warfare and that's

3245.16 --> 3250.2799999999997
it

3246.839 --> 3251.52
microorganisms can't do these things

3250.28 --> 3254.52
they're

3251.52 --> 3254.52
fiction

3255.68 --> 3261.7599999999998
Anon welcome to the show thanks for

3258.0 --> 3261.76
asking a good question

3269.28 --> 3272.489
[Music]

3282.72 --> 3288.799
but as for a stage for biowarfare I mean

3286.24 --> 3291.9199999999996
this mind control

3288.799 --> 3295.64
procedure is what is

3291.92 --> 3299.359
biowarfare biowarfare is mind control

3295.64 --> 3303.24
like purely it's pure mind control there

3299.359 --> 3308.319
is no actual biological danger like at

3303.24 --> 3308.319
all it was always a myth it was always a

3308.359 --> 3315.96
ruse always from the start it was always

3312.04 --> 3317.079
a ruse it's a futurist based Medical

3315.96 --> 3321.2
Science

3317.079 --> 3326.319
Fiction rooted

3321.2 --> 3329.4399999999996
ruse a mind control set of trickery to

3326.319 --> 3330.52
to push people into participating in

3329.44 --> 3333.839
medical

3330.52 --> 3336.16
experimentation to whatever end that's

3333.839 --> 3340.2
what it is that's what biowarfare is

3336.16 --> 3340.2
it's pure mind control

3356.44 --> 3361.48
yes yes clutch yeah now what it does the

3359.68 --> 3365.2
medical

3361.48 --> 3366.68
experiment what it did is just create

3365.2 --> 3369.2799999999997
chronic

3366.68 --> 3371.68
vulnerability it actually

3369.28 --> 3375.3590000000004
destabilized the natural functions of

3371.68 --> 3379.2
the body to be able to repair the damage

3375.359 --> 3381.16
which is what sickness is and in a way

3379.2 --> 3383.0
it's kind of ironic

3381.16 --> 3386.359
because they

3383.0 --> 3388.319
promise will prevent it will prevent you

3386.359 --> 3391.119
from becoming

3388.319 --> 3393.839
sick but that very

3391.119 --> 3395.559
statement is

3393.839 --> 3400.88
technically

3395.559 --> 3403.96
asinine because you shouldn't want to be

3400.88 --> 3407.28
having sickness prevented sickness is

3403.96 --> 3410.28
the fixing of your body sickness is the

3407.28 --> 3414.599
symptom it's not a

3410.28 --> 3418.96
thing it's like yeah take this and and

3414.599 --> 3421.48
we will prevent your wounds from

3418.96 --> 3424.039
healing that's basically what that it

3421.48 --> 3428.359
means yeah prevent you from becoming

3424.039 --> 3430.8390000000004
sick oh so that means that I can't fix

3428.359 --> 3433.52
that anymore then because that is what

3430.839 --> 3438.16
sickness is it's your body

3433.52 --> 3442.599
fixing fixing the thing that's causing

3438.16 --> 3444.96
it and by taking a medical experiment

3442.599 --> 3448.1600000000003
it's like yeah your ability to fix it's

3444.96 --> 3448.16
now been compromised

3449.76 --> 3456.2000000000003
from that perspective again this weird

3452.359 --> 3458.4
legal trickery based on that it is all

3456.2 --> 3460.64
actually science fiction Medical Science

3458.4 --> 3463.079
Fiction well then like well they

3460.64 --> 3466.2799999999997
actually spoke the truth it's just you

3463.079 --> 3470.079
were crazy

3466.28 --> 3473.119
enough to believe in the science fiction

3470.079 --> 3476.6800000000003
and look at it from that perspective

3473.119 --> 3479.839
getting the entire scenario of how these

3476.68 --> 3479.839
things work

3481.64 --> 3485.0389999999998
wrong it's

3485.92 --> 3492.799
insane designers of these medical

3489.28 --> 3494.7200000000003
experiments they must have like

3492.799 --> 3497.92
conclusive

3494.72 --> 3500.48
research that it is wrong that their

3497.92 --> 3504.16
entire premise is

3500.48 --> 3506.64
faulty that the model is not

3504.16 --> 3509.0789999999997
real the medical model

3506.64 --> 3514.48
of what they occupy themselves

3509.079 --> 3514.48
with they must know because they

3515.72 --> 3522.0389999999998
legally ensure themselves and you can

3519.2 --> 3526.52
only do that if you

3522.039 --> 3526.5200000000004
know that it's wrong

3536.319 --> 3545.0
of the movie outbreak it's a stupid

3539.24 --> 3545.0
[ __ ] [ __ ] movie Anon outbreak it

3546.64 --> 3552.96
sucks yeah it is a farce it's a

3549.799 --> 3554.799
monstrous mind control farce that's

3552.96 --> 3558.079
exactly what it

3554.799 --> 3559.92
is it's pure fear

3558.079 --> 3565.3590000000004
porn

3559.92 --> 3565.359
it's uh what do you call it um

3567.599 --> 3572.48
what do you call it like

3569.88 --> 3575.799
germophobe there's a more specific way

3572.48 --> 3575.799
for it name for

3576.48 --> 3580.939
[Applause]

3577.86 --> 3580.9390000000003
[Music]

3585.24 --> 3590.2799999999997
it there's a better word for it not

3591.72 --> 3596.9599999999996
germophobia what's the better word for

3593.96 --> 3596.96
it

3602.96 --> 3608.92
somebody please help me to remind what

3606.44 --> 3611.44
is that word of people that are like

3608.92 --> 3615.52
always afraid of like getting

3611.44 --> 3615.52
sick what is the word for

3615.84 --> 3622.7690000000002
[Music]

3624.64 --> 3630.0789999999997
that no so phobia what

3630.4 --> 3635.88
no it's a classic word why

3637.079 --> 3645.44
can hypochondria that's

3641.4 --> 3648.119
it hypochondriac thanks KP we figured it

3645.44 --> 3648.119
out at the same

3652.92 --> 3659.359
time yeah it's weaponized mind control

3656.68 --> 3662.1189999999997
hypochondria it literally creates a

3659.359 --> 3665.92
virtual scenario that stimulates

3662.119 --> 3669.839
everybody into a hypochondriac

3665.92 --> 3669.839
response which is based in

3670.839 --> 3678.0
fear and the movie outbreak is like the

3673.48 --> 3679.92
personification of that it's all pure

3678.0 --> 3682.599
unadulterated fear

3679.92 --> 3684.64
porn based on medical science fiction

3682.599 --> 3687.92
that isn't real and it doesn't work like

3684.64 --> 3687.92
that at all

3694.24 --> 3701.2
oh defate the virus hey hey hey Anton

3697.839 --> 3704.0389999999998
hey hey hey hey hey he hey hey hey hey

3701.2 --> 3708.0389999999998
viruses don't exist

3704.039 --> 3711.559
dumbass there is no physical evidence

3708.039 --> 3717.8390000000004
based in science of viruses existing as

3711.559 --> 3720.2400000000002
a thing it's a concept that's not proven

3717.839 --> 3727.279
yeah show

3720.24 --> 3732.0789999999997
it show it yeah you can't cuz it doesn't

3727.279 --> 3732.079
exist yeah like any of

3733.319 --> 3736.7599999999998
it

3734.96 --> 3740.92
viruses

3736.76 --> 3744.3590000000004
universally don't exist they're Medical

3740.92 --> 3744.359
Science Fiction

3745.75 --> 3749.449
[Music]

3752.279 --> 3757.64
yeah who that's what theor call

3758.76 --> 3765.88
it just just telling

3762.559 --> 3771.079
you viruses are medical science fiction

3765.88 --> 3772.799
they don't exist there is no evidence

3771.079 --> 3777.48
for them

3772.799 --> 3777.48
existing they're virtual

3784.559 --> 3791.7200000000003
yeah you can't cultivate viruses in a

3788.039 --> 3795.119
pet tree dish that's never been

3791.72 --> 3797.1189999999997
done yeah you can cultivate bacteria in

3795.119 --> 3800.2000000000003
a Petri dish

3797.119 --> 3803.359
sure you can't do that with

3800.2 --> 3807.2
viruses yeah to just show that

3803.359 --> 3810.5589999999997
supposedly some kind of virus is in

3807.2 --> 3815.24
anything have you ever F looked into the

3810.559 --> 3818.7200000000003
freaky procedure that medical

3815.24 --> 3822.5589999999997
labrants have to do just to be able to

3818.72 --> 3827.64
establish some kind of virus being in

3822.559 --> 3827.6400000000003
something it's totally insane

3827.72 --> 3834.0789999999997
like it's like they create a witch's

3831.119 --> 3837.359
brew it's very much like a witch in a

3834.079 --> 3839.599
cauldron just throwing sh and poison and

3837.359 --> 3843.359
mashing it up and then taking it out and

3839.599 --> 3846.2400000000002
filtering and more poison it's totally

3843.359 --> 3848.5589999999997
insane if you actually believe that that

3846.24 --> 3852.839
procedure that supposedly reveals a

3848.559 --> 3852.8390000000004
virus in anything is

3854.359 --> 3858.96
legitimate then you are fooled you are

3857.559 --> 3862.6800000000003
fooled

3858.96 --> 3865.119
by Magic gobble deg

3862.68 --> 3867.9199999999996
procedure because that's what that is

3865.119 --> 3868.6800000000003
and medical professionals have actually

3867.92 --> 3872.079
come

3868.68 --> 3875.319
out and shared that procedure and told

3872.079 --> 3877.76
us like this makes no sense bitshoot is

3875.319 --> 3880.2
full of these videos of medical

3877.76 --> 3883.079
professionals medical labyrinths that

3880.2 --> 3887.0789999999997
are telling you this is complete

3883.079 --> 3889.88
nonsense viruses don't exist look this

3887.079 --> 3892.079
is what supposedly is the virus that you

3889.88 --> 3894.799
would have proven with that procedure

3892.079 --> 3896.2000000000003
it's not even a coherent unit of

3894.799 --> 3898.48
anything

3896.2 --> 3902.24
it's total

3898.48 --> 3903.279
nonsense it's gobble deg viruses are

3902.24 --> 3906.9199999999996
gobble

3903.279 --> 3910.039
deg totally made up

3906.92 --> 3912.92
horseshit it's what it is they don't

3910.039 --> 3916.3190000000004
exist they're a virtual thing that does

3912.92 --> 3916.319
not exist in

3917.92 --> 3921.44
reality that's right

3922.52 --> 3928.48
K yeah and bacteria do exist

3927.359 --> 3933.24
but

3928.48 --> 3937.48
bacteria exist in our bodies our bodies

3933.24 --> 3941.2
have huge amounts of like vast

3937.48 --> 3944.92
percentages of bacteria that are present

3941.2 --> 3949.7599999999998
everywhere you know why because they're

3944.92 --> 3952.88
assimilated into our bodies they have

3949.76 --> 3957.1600000000003
jobs they have jobs

3952.88 --> 3960.44
everywhere skin bacteria got Flora

3957.16 --> 3963.279
bacteria bacteria surrounding certain

3960.44 --> 3965.119
types of tissues they all have their

3963.279 --> 3967.2
functions and they're all just waiting

3965.119 --> 3969.76
there in line for the right conditions

3967.2 --> 3972.5989999999997
to happen so they can do their thing as

3969.76 --> 3975.5200000000004
they are assigned and checked up by

3972.599 --> 3977.92
white blood cells like are you still in

3975.52 --> 3981.359
position is there enough of these

3977.92 --> 3984.799
specific bacterias here are they ready

3981.359 --> 3987.0789999999997
to do their thing are you ready for the

3984.799 --> 3990.96
job that you might need to do if the

3987.079 --> 3993.6800000000003
circumstances arrive yeah they're part

3990.96 --> 3996.559
of your body there is bacteria are

3993.68 --> 4000.0789999999997
literally assimilated into your body's

3996.559 --> 4002.2400000000002
function without bacteria we would

4000.079 --> 4005.88
instantaneously

4002.24 --> 4010.72
die and you can assimilate new bacteria

4005.88 --> 4012.559
into you it's like hey this a weird back

4010.72 --> 4015.9599999999996
like you're going to you're going into

4012.559 --> 4017.799
the jungle and there's like some weird

4015.96 --> 4019.559
Brew there it's like yeah this is

4017.799 --> 4023.559
bacteria from here they're kind of

4019.559 --> 4026.96
aggressive but you might have a reaction

4023.559 --> 4028.119
but if you like don't get super sick

4026.96 --> 4030.839
from the

4028.119 --> 4033.079
reaction then you can assimilate those

4030.839 --> 4035.0789999999997
bacteria and they you'll have very

4033.079 --> 4036.92
strong bacteria that have that will

4035.079 --> 4039.7200000000003
actually help protect you that are very

4036.92 --> 4042.48
tenacious they won't go away as easily

4039.72 --> 4044.52
they won't be destroyed so easily but

4042.48 --> 4048.44
they'll serve

4044.52 --> 4051.52
you if you allow them to assimilate into

4048.44 --> 4055.96
your body because that's what bacteria

4051.52 --> 4059.52
do they they are part of bigger

4055.96 --> 4059.52
organisms they're like

4065.039 --> 4071.2400000000002
workers right and hey getting foreign

4068.64 --> 4073.5989999999997
workers in for the first time you're

4071.24 --> 4076.1189999999997
going to get some cultural problems

4073.599 --> 4078.599
right they don't speak your language

4076.119 --> 4081.119
it's like they have these weird habits

4078.599 --> 4082.96
they don't respect your habits and you

4081.119 --> 4085.48
don't understand their habits and there

4082.96 --> 4088.76
might be some hassle some social hassle

4085.48 --> 4093.039
even maybe even freaking protests or

4088.76 --> 4095.5600000000004
demonstrations or or riots yeah that's

4093.039 --> 4099.6
that first response from a foreign

4095.56 --> 4102.199
bacteria but once the differences are

4099.6 --> 4104.319
settled then suddenly they're like oh

4102.199 --> 4106.12
now they're integrated yeah they were

4104.319 --> 4108.319
foreigners but now they're integrated

4106.12 --> 4110.64
and it turns out that they're actually

4108.319 --> 4113.719
very skilled at certain things and

4110.64 --> 4117.64
they're great workers now that they're

4113.719 --> 4117.64
integrated that's how I see

4119.12 --> 4122.12
bacteria

4126.239 --> 4132.5599999999995
yeah could it be that your environment

4128.64 --> 4136.159000000001
made you sick well toxic

4132.56 --> 4138.92
environment does in like the disease is

4136.159 --> 4141.839
the response to the toxic

4138.92 --> 4144.4400000000005
environment that response is there to

4141.839 --> 4148.359
clean it up the disease is the

4144.44 --> 4150.839
noticeable reaction of your body that is

4148.359 --> 4154.1990000000005
cleaning up the

4150.839 --> 4157.159
toxic thing that is actually doing

4154.199 --> 4159.4
damage now the toxic thing doing damage

4157.159 --> 4162.239
is not even that

4159.4 --> 4164.599999999999
noticeable but the cleaning up process

4162.239 --> 4167.3189999999995
of that toxic influence is very

4164.6 --> 4169.799
noticeable and that's the disease but

4167.319 --> 4174.759
the disease that is noticeable the

4169.799 --> 4174.759
symptoms are actually what it's like the

4175.719 --> 4180.759
war yeah I mean like there's terrorists

4178.64 --> 4183.159000000001
in these buildings well you don't notice

4180.759 --> 4185.12
that it's silent it's like yeah you know

4183.159 --> 4188.599999999999
they're there but it doesn't nothing

4185.12 --> 4191.4
happens [ __ ] happens when the soldiers

4188.6 --> 4193.52
go in to get terrorists yeah that's when

4191.4 --> 4196.4
[ __ ] blows up that's when bullets start

4193.52 --> 4198.1990000000005
firing it's not because the terrorist

4196.4 --> 4201.0
there that bullets start flying no it's

4198.199 --> 4203.879999999999
because there is a response to remove

4201.0 --> 4206.36
them and that is the part that's

4203.88 --> 4210.2390000000005
noticeable that's the disease the

4206.36 --> 4212.599999999999
disease is the cleaning up process that

4210.239 --> 4216.199
gets messy and

4212.6 --> 4221.120000000001
noticeable but effectively the disease

4216.199 --> 4224.32
is the procedure of your body to clean

4221.12 --> 4228.4
it up it's the good thing it's the

4224.32 --> 4230.5199999999995
maneuver to purify that is

4228.4 --> 4233.04
noticeable and it's not something that

4230.52 --> 4233.040000000001
should be

4233.8 --> 4239.4800000000005
stopped I mean that's like oh well the

4237.04 --> 4241.4
this police force is is going to move in

4239.48 --> 4244.48
to get the terrorists right out of the

4241.4 --> 4247.599999999999
building who threaten everybody for

4244.48 --> 4249.959999999999
their crazy goal and they're like no no

4247.6 --> 4253.04
you can't get in there we don't want any

4249.96 --> 4256.12
violence we want peace and quiet you're

4253.04 --> 4259.6
not going to go after them what

4256.12 --> 4261.599999999999
but then they just get just get away and

4259.6 --> 4264.159000000001
they're just going to keep doing their

4261.6 --> 4264.159000000001
thing

4264.239 --> 4269.239
then see how crazy that is stop the

4267.36 --> 4272.92
disease

4269.239 --> 4277.919999999999
what stop the cleaning up of the

4272.92 --> 4277.92
mess how crazy is that

4290.84 --> 4296.400000000001
right and to take it a step further like

4293.84 --> 4298.32
bacteria in our bodies we bodies

4296.4 --> 4300.599999999999
assimilate the bacteria the bacteria go

4298.32 --> 4305.44
and work for the body it goes even

4300.6 --> 4305.4400000000005
further than that did you know

4305.719 --> 4308.719
that

4309.04 --> 4317.04
bacteria some of them at least they have

4313.04 --> 4317.04
transmutative qualities

4318.32 --> 4324.5599999999995
like in the early 20th century there was

4321.56 --> 4325.56
a doctor who figured out by checking it

4324.56 --> 4328.4800000000005
under a

4325.56 --> 4330.639
microscope that with certain electrical

4328.48 --> 4332.239
conditions I think it was not chemical

4330.639 --> 4335.8
but

4332.239 --> 4337.08
electrical a blood platelet right stuff

4335.8 --> 4341.84
in her

4337.08 --> 4345.48
blood would be transformed into a

4341.84 --> 4347.08
bacteria and then from a bacteria into A

4345.48 --> 4351.32
fungi

4347.08 --> 4356.5599999999995
Spore and then from A fungi Spore black

4351.32 --> 4356.5599999999995
back into a blood P platelet

4360.48 --> 4368.32
yeah I mean they're literally like

4364.6 --> 4372.280000000001
building blocks of our freaking body I

4368.32 --> 4372.28
mean that's what it is

4372.639 --> 4379.04
dude yeah bacteria

4375.84 --> 4380.84
can literally be blood platelets or a

4379.04 --> 4383.5199999999995
fungi

4380.84 --> 4387.56
Spore and and

4383.52 --> 4391.719
transform back and forth under the right

4387.56 --> 4394.88
conditions and I mean the body actually

4391.719 --> 4397.6
uses this so the body can

4394.88 --> 4399.56
technically take a bunch of blood platet

4397.6 --> 4402.280000000001
in your blood is just flowing around all

4399.56 --> 4404.56
the time and just basically send the

4402.28 --> 4406.159
signal okay you're going to change in

4404.56 --> 4409.6
these bacter IIA

4406.159 --> 4413.5199999999995
now and suddenly oh I got an infection

4409.6 --> 4416.04
here why is that well your body assess

4413.52 --> 4419.0
that you needed those specific bacteria

4416.04 --> 4421.92
in that specific region of the body to

4419.0 --> 4424.32
clean something up where did they come

4421.92 --> 4428.08
from oh I got infected from the outside

4424.32 --> 4432.4
no no you got infected from the

4428.08 --> 4435.6
inside your body

4432.4 --> 4437.799999999999
transmuted parts of your blood like or

4435.6 --> 4440.04
other wherever they are but I mean with

4437.8 --> 4442.8
this specific case it's like yeah blood

4440.04 --> 4445.04
platelets can transform into bacteria

4442.8 --> 4448.360000000001
and into fungal spores and back into

4445.04 --> 4450.4
blood platlets under specific electrical

4448.36 --> 4453.199
conditions if I remember correctly so

4450.4 --> 4455.159
your body can literally just order your

4453.199 --> 4458.638999999999
blood to

4455.159 --> 4462.36
transform into bacteria so that those

4458.639 --> 4465.4400000000005
bacteria then perform a specific task of

4462.36 --> 4468.4
cleaning something up it's like where

4465.44 --> 4470.32
this bacteria come from your body

4468.4 --> 4474.04
summoned

4470.32 --> 4477.159
them it transformed your blood into

4474.04 --> 4479.4
those bacteria to perform those specific

4477.159 --> 4483.04
functions that those bacteria

4479.4 --> 4488.04
do yeah that's how

4483.04 --> 4491.679
intricated bacteria are into your being

4488.04 --> 4493.32
yeah they're not a foreign outside thing

4491.679 --> 4495.6
that's just oh we're going to get in

4493.32 --> 4500.0
there and we're going to ruin the

4495.6 --> 4502.88
place no no that's not what it is it's

4500.0 --> 4502.88
not what it is at

4511.04 --> 4514.28
all all

4518.48 --> 4523.718999999999
right what the

4520.719 --> 4527.199
hell what you just

4523.719 --> 4529.76
don't don't space it just call it

4527.199 --> 4533.5199999999995
participation in a medical experiment

4529.76 --> 4538.8
just leave the the V word out of it just

4533.52 --> 4538.8
you don't spacing it up is not helping

4540.12 --> 4546.5199999999995
clut it's easier to just say participate

4543.88 --> 4548.56
in a medical experiment I mean you're

4546.52 --> 4551.679
going to get through all the filters

4548.56 --> 4554.719
there's nothing they could ever do about

4551.679 --> 4560.04
you calling it a medical experiment

4554.719 --> 4560.04
there nothing any sensors could ever

4560.239 --> 4566.5599999999995
do about you calling it that and like

4563.84 --> 4569.56
everybody knows what what you'll mean

4566.56 --> 4572.0
everybody will figure it out it's very

4569.56 --> 4575.639
easy ever since I

4572.0 --> 4578.76
switched from using a v word

4575.639 --> 4581.639
to participate in a medical experiment I

4578.76 --> 4584.96
mean I've never had trouble ever since

4581.639 --> 4587.88
and you have like super Dynamic freedom

4584.96 --> 4587.88
to talk about it

4588.6 --> 4593.92
now like without any chance of like some

4592.239 --> 4595.879999999999
algorithm getting

4593.92 --> 4599.96
triggered so

4595.88 --> 4603.0
just just avoid the V word and describe

4599.96 --> 4605.2390000000005
it as participation in a medical

4603.0 --> 4607.4
experiment and and like everybody will

4605.239 --> 4607.4
get

4609.28 --> 4614.55
it anyway

4611.37 --> 4614.55
[Music]

4615.0 --> 4619.04
think there will be more pseudo

4616.8 --> 4624.12
biowarfare companies with forced

4619.04 --> 4628.28
regulations within near years well

4624.12 --> 4628.28
Anon they're desperate to

4628.719 --> 4634.96
try but the problem is is that to them

4632.56 --> 4637.8
is that the wider like they've already

4634.96 --> 4641.199
done most of the damage that they will

4637.8 --> 4643.84
be able to do because they're going to

4641.199 --> 4647.28
try to just roll out the same [ __ ]

4643.84 --> 4652.679
exactly the same as as they did in

4647.28 --> 4655.48
2020 but there's so much information now

4652.679 --> 4656.4400000000005
about what what it was and what they've

4655.48 --> 4660.239
done

4656.44 --> 4662.919999999999
and like they'll try to roll it out the

4660.239 --> 4664.959999999999
same but it's not going to work and they

4662.92 --> 4668.1990000000005
already know that it's not going to work

4664.96 --> 4671.52
they just don't know what else to do cuz

4668.199 --> 4675.0
that is their entire

4671.52 --> 4677.719
game is to do that that that's what it

4675.0 --> 4680.0
exists for it's it's a population

4677.719 --> 4683.56
control through mind

4680.0 --> 4683.56
control it's what it

4684.92 --> 4690.36
is but the mind control is failing

4687.719 --> 4692.56
people have been figuring it out and

4690.36 --> 4695.679
that information has been spreading

4692.56 --> 4698.88
rapidly despite all the censorship it's

4695.679 --> 4703.639
like massively spread

4698.88 --> 4705.52
around and so a new roll out is not

4703.639 --> 4709.92
going to be

4705.52 --> 4711.76
even as remotely as Su successful from a

4709.92 --> 4715.639
population control

4711.76 --> 4718.52
perspective as the original roll out was

4715.639 --> 4721.8
it's like that's not going to work

4718.52 --> 4725.040000000001
again I mean most people on who that

4721.8 --> 4728.2390000000005
would have worked are probably already

4725.04 --> 4729.48
like damaged Beyond repair or dead right

4728.239 --> 4733.4
anyway I'm going to take a two-minute

4729.48 --> 4733.4
break I'll be right back

4763.719 --> 4766.719
come

4793.639 --> 4796.639
for

4823.639 --> 4827.679
e e

4866.08 --> 4868.6
and I'm

4877.04 --> 4880.239
back all

4882.6 --> 4888.08
right so anyway and and like yeah you

4886.04 --> 4889.36
asked are they're going to try anything

4888.08 --> 4893.92
new like

4889.36 --> 4893.92
this well yeah they

4897.32 --> 4903.44
might

4899.8 --> 4907.2390000000005
but if more people are aware that the

4903.44 --> 4909.919999999999
proper response is that you literally

4907.239 --> 4912.5199999999995
say no and then it's like well fire me

4909.92 --> 4915.1990000000005
then take it all away from me whatever

4912.52 --> 4919.4800000000005
you were going to do

4915.199 --> 4919.48
and after you've done that I will sue

4922.159 --> 4927.879999999999
you right and they will win and they

4925.48 --> 4931.36
will know that they will win well that's

4927.88 --> 4934.1990000000005
going to make it less successful because

4931.36 --> 4937.159
if enough just people say well okay fire

4934.199 --> 4940.28
me then take this away from me do that

4937.159 --> 4942.638999999999
and I'll sue you if enough people figure

4940.28 --> 4945.88
out that that's the the recourse that

4942.639 --> 4948.56
you need to stick stick to in response

4945.88 --> 4952.32
to some situation rolling out like that

4948.56 --> 4952.320000000001
well then they're

4952.719 --> 4958.32
screwed there will go out of business CU

4956.36 --> 4962.28
their business is

4958.32 --> 4965.84
dependent on people giving into whatever

4962.28 --> 4969.08
blackmail or whatever however you see it

4965.84 --> 4972.12
in order to participate in the medical

4969.08 --> 4975.8
experiment that once they agree to that

4972.12 --> 4978.08
the producer is completely safeguarded

4975.8 --> 4981.4800000000005
they will get the money and they will

4978.08 --> 4987.0
not risk anything all they require is

4981.48 --> 4990.48
for people to be manipulated into

4987.0 --> 4995.239
agreeing but if too many people just

4990.48 --> 4998.638999999999
don't agree no matter what then they go

4995.239 --> 5001.0
bust the Mind Control operation fails

4998.639 --> 5006.4400000000005
all the people that have attempted to

5001.0 --> 5006.44
coer people into agreeing all get

5008.08 --> 5013.84
sued and then you don't even as that

5010.92 --> 5018.12
medical company you don't even have

5013.84 --> 5022.08
enough groups and conspirators and

5018.12 --> 5026.76
people in positions of power left to

5022.08 --> 5026.76
even roll out the Mind Control

5031.159 --> 5037.08
operation by what do you mean by Lu

5062.4 --> 5066.32
level who are you talking to

5079.8 --> 5085.92
right so don't forget to Rogan up the

5081.84 --> 5089.28
show only seeing one over there which is

5085.92 --> 5092.52
ridiculous after almost one and a half

5089.28 --> 5096.119
hour of a

5092.52 --> 5100.0
concentrated gravy if I I say so myself

5096.119 --> 5102.36
good information durable long-term good

5100.0 --> 5105.92
information that anybody that gets what

5102.36 --> 5108.48
I'm talking about can use for the

5105.92 --> 5110.639
foreseeable

5108.48 --> 5113.08
future like this is

5110.639 --> 5117.400000000001
psychological

5113.08 --> 5119.6
immunization against population control

5117.4 --> 5125.32
attempts everything that I'm sharing

5119.6 --> 5125.320000000001
right here it's all critical knowledge

5145.4 --> 5156.239
okay oh so Anon asks the flu is really

5152.159 --> 5156.239
is real but not act

5159.28 --> 5164.84
contagious well it's not contagious in

5162.32 --> 5168.0
the sense that there

5164.84 --> 5170.719
is like

5168.0 --> 5174.639
particles or

5170.719 --> 5180.44
microorganisms that are causing the

5174.639 --> 5185.159000000001
disease the microorganism activity is a

5180.44 --> 5185.159
side effect it's not the cause

5185.4 --> 5189.28
it's a correlation isn't causation kind

5188.32 --> 5193.719
of

5189.28 --> 5195.679
situation cuz you can actually expose

5193.719 --> 5200.199
people to the

5195.679 --> 5203.32
concentrated correlator side side

5200.199 --> 5207.638999999999
issues bacteria or all these things and

5203.32 --> 5208.679
it won't actually cause the disease cpid

5207.639 --> 5214.92
is not

5208.679 --> 5218.36
applied yeah a lot of this flu how it so

5214.92 --> 5220.36
seems to jump like oh somebody in the

5218.36 --> 5222.48
family gets sick oh now everybody in the

5220.36 --> 5225.799999999999
family gets sick yeah you know what

5222.48 --> 5227.759999999999
that's that is it's not a physical

5225.8 --> 5231.08
infection you can literally have a

5227.76 --> 5234.52
person be sick be behind

5231.08 --> 5237.159
barriers like glass barriers not even

5234.52 --> 5240.6
having the same air circulating and then

5237.159 --> 5242.08
another person that's sympathetic or

5240.6 --> 5245.8
close

5242.08 --> 5249.32
by visually in proxim

5245.8 --> 5251.04
auditorally in proximity can then still

5249.32 --> 5253.96
get that disease even though they're

5251.04 --> 5257.239
perfectly closed off it's not because oh

5253.96 --> 5259.8
a virus is so small it just went through

5257.239 --> 5262.599999999999
the cracks and got to no it's because

5259.8 --> 5265.76
it's not caused by a freaking particle

5262.6 --> 5268.360000000001
entering your system it's caused by

5265.76 --> 5271.679
sympathic

5268.36 --> 5276.28
resonance your body picks up on another

5271.679 --> 5279.6
body performing a Disease an operation

5276.28 --> 5283.759999999999
to clean up and your body then considers

5279.6 --> 5285.320000000001
like H maybe I should do that too I

5283.76 --> 5287.679
could use a good

5285.32 --> 5289.36
cleanup and then your body just starts

5287.679 --> 5293.08
doing

5289.36 --> 5293.08
it sympathic

5293.84 --> 5300.400000000001
resonance that's how the flu

5297.239 --> 5302.959999999999
spreads and then some

5300.4 --> 5307.32
people especially those that are aware

5302.96 --> 5309.639
of it can lit like like me yeah there's

5307.32 --> 5312.5199999999995
been people here that have had the flu

5309.639 --> 5315.88
all the time they're

5312.52 --> 5318.320000000001
like coughing all freaking day long

5315.88 --> 5321.92
being all shitty feeling all sickly and

5318.32 --> 5326.44
it's like oh one two three people in one

5321.92 --> 5328.679
house right here having the flu even

5326.44 --> 5332.44
taking stupid medication and all that

5328.679 --> 5336.32
[ __ ] and I'm like yeah they have the

5332.44 --> 5340.96
flu and I don't get it I don't get the

5336.32 --> 5346.32
flu you know why because I don't hold on

5340.96 --> 5349.08
to this science fiction model of being

5346.32 --> 5351.4
infected by the proximity of some

5349.08 --> 5353.92
particle entering my system I don't have

5351.4 --> 5355.239
fear of being infected because I know

5353.92 --> 5359.92
that's not

5355.239 --> 5364.159
real and my system doesn't need to go

5359.92 --> 5367.4800000000005
through a flu scenario

5364.159 --> 5370.719
because I'm already cleaned up and so I

5367.48 --> 5373.28
just don't get it I just don't get the

5370.719 --> 5375.679
flu even I'm surrounded by people that

5373.28 --> 5379.599999999999
blatantly have it with like green snot

5375.679 --> 5383.36
and everything it's like yeah I'm just

5379.6 --> 5386.4800000000005
not going to get sick cuz I know what

5383.36 --> 5390.04
this is and I don't need to get sick and

5386.48 --> 5393.799999999999
I'm not going to fear spiral that will

5390.04 --> 5396.92
lead to toxic situation that might be an

5393.8 --> 5398.88
in incentive for my body to trigger

5396.92 --> 5401.96
getting

5398.88 --> 5404.36
sick so I just won't get sick and that's

5401.96 --> 5404.36
how that

5415.0 --> 5421.28
works so Anton I hope that answers your

5418.28 --> 5421.28
question

5424.719 --> 5430.08
is anybody still here that you all just

5427.239 --> 5430.08
leave all of a

5449.44 --> 5456.96
[Music]

5451.04 --> 5456.96
sudden oh KP you're still here hello for

5462.46 --> 5465.529
[Music]

5471.45 --> 5474.58
[Music]

5478.06 --> 5481.2390000000005
[Applause]

5494.8 --> 5498.419
[Music]

5509.88 --> 5515.909000000001
okay

5512.31 --> 5515.909000000001
[Music]

5520.119 --> 5523.119
okay

5550.8 --> 5560.400000000001
yeah g get this title and it's perfect

5554.32 --> 5560.4
title 100 characters three compartments

5566.74 --> 5569.898999999999
[Music]

5581.76 --> 5584.76
that

5586.95 --> 5590.16
[Applause]

5613.239 --> 5617.879999999999
you should look into like I've already

5615.0 --> 5617.88
looked into all

5625.719 --> 5634.08
that Mna is dude microbiology is

5630.28 --> 5634.08
completely inconclusive

5635.4 --> 5640.879999999999
what yeah Dr Lanka I'm very well aware

5638.36 --> 5642.799999999999
and Dr Hammer I absolutely know about

5640.88 --> 5646.119
German new medicine dude I talked about

5642.8 --> 5649.119000000001
German new medicine like

5646.119 --> 5649.119
before

5649.28 --> 5656.92
2020 my dad was like into that and

5654.04 --> 5659.92
trying to teach me like like even in

5656.92 --> 5659.92
2017

5666.119 --> 5670.759999999999
microbiology is mostly science

5672.6 --> 5679.159000000001
fiction you were addressing Chad I'm not

5675.48 --> 5679.159
seeing who you're addressing

5680.239 --> 5687.08
but right Anon says yes I see sympathic

5684.36 --> 5687.08
resonance

5688.36 --> 5700.0
yes like that's how a cold or the blue

5696.199 --> 5701.678999999999
may seem to spread it's not because of

5700.0 --> 5704.04
particle

5701.679 --> 5707.08
transfer it's because of sympathic

5704.04 --> 5710.239
resonance because it's like a procedure

5707.08 --> 5712.88
the body's undergoing and another body

5710.239 --> 5715.718999999999
in its presence of so of another body

5712.88 --> 5718.679
going undergoing that procedure May then

5715.719 --> 5722.199
resonate and realize like hey I should

5718.679 --> 5724.96
do that too I should start that clean up

5722.199 --> 5729.32
like it's B basically you could compare

5724.96 --> 5731.2390000000005
it to like you're in a what is it in a

5729.32 --> 5733.5599999999995
student house or whatever and you're in

5731.239 --> 5735.759999999999
your room and it's like yeah you're

5733.56 --> 5737.96
living there it's all fine right and you

5735.76 --> 5740.4400000000005
don't know you just do whatever you do

5737.96 --> 5742.719
and then one day it's like one of your

5740.44 --> 5745.719
roommates is just like going nuts and

5742.719 --> 5748.0
they're like I feel terrible you're like

5745.719 --> 5750.44
what's going on I like I don't know I

5748.0 --> 5752.52
can't figure it out I'm going to clean

5750.44 --> 5757.04
my

5752.52 --> 5758.4400000000005
room and and you're like oh okay and

5757.04 --> 5759.8
then you start looking at them like

5758.44 --> 5762.5599999999995
they're cleaning their room and they're

5759.8 --> 5764.52
like being really meticulous like who

5762.56 --> 5766.56
and you suddenly notice like holy [ __ ]

5764.52 --> 5768.8
yeah it was a mess you didn't see it

5766.56 --> 5770.8
because I wasn't really looking at it

5768.8 --> 5772.92
but yeah his room really is a mess and

5770.8 --> 5774.88
then wow he's really cleaning up and

5772.92 --> 5778.04
then as you're witnessing him cleaning

5774.88 --> 5780.76
it up it's like you know

5778.04 --> 5784.28
what now that I've become kind of aware

5780.76 --> 5786.159000000001
of how messy that is I'm noticing my

5784.28 --> 5789.92
room's kind of messy

5786.159 --> 5792.5199999999995
too hm I should probably clean up my

5789.92 --> 5796.04
room as well I wouldn't have thought of

5792.52 --> 5798.96
it if I hadn't seen my roommate over

5796.04 --> 5801.76
there cleaning up his room cuz I just

5798.96 --> 5803.32
wasn't looking at it yeah and then you

5801.76 --> 5806.6
start to clean up your

5803.32 --> 5812.0
room that's the best

5806.6 --> 5814.8
comparison to how the flu or a cold

5812.0 --> 5816.48
spreads your body is just picking up on

5814.8 --> 5819.639
like

5816.48 --> 5823.239
hey there's something going on

5819.639 --> 5826.2390000000005
there H maybe that's a good idea to do

5823.239 --> 5829.638999999999
that too sympathic

5826.239 --> 5834.08
resonance it's the best comparison as to

5829.639 --> 5836.119
like why a disease seems to spread when

5834.08 --> 5839.239
you're in the presence of somebody

5836.119 --> 5842.36
that's going through that

5839.239 --> 5844.839999999999
disease your body just becomes aware of

5842.36 --> 5847.92
certain frequency a certain

5844.84 --> 5851.32
aspect of their condition and then

5847.92 --> 5853.96
realize hey I could do that too and

5851.32 --> 5856.159
that's then why everybody does it it's

5853.96 --> 5859.8
basically the body's like oh this is

5856.159 --> 5863.839999999999
trendy I want to do that Trend too this

5859.8 --> 5863.84
is the newest Trend yeah let's clean it

5868.76 --> 5874.320000000001
up I wonder how long it will be to

5872.4 --> 5876.598999999999
address the chat this what are you

5874.32 --> 5880.48
talking about Lucy I'm literally

5876.599 --> 5880.4800000000005
addressing everything that's being

5883.28 --> 5887.44
said I don't know if you have like a

5885.44 --> 5889.638999999999
10minute delay or anything I'm

5887.44 --> 5892.719
addressing everything that's being

5889.639 --> 5892.719
talked about

5893.04 --> 5897.679
everything I don't know what your

5894.92 --> 5897.679
complaint is

5901.119 --> 5905.44
here what do you even mean defend

5910.84 --> 5915.8
I might complaining that nobody's

5912.48 --> 5917.799999999999
talking what what where I was

5915.8 --> 5920.320000000001
complaining when nobody was talking for

5917.8 --> 5920.320000000001
like 10

5924.04 --> 5934.44
minutes but that's changed since then

5929.119 --> 5938.239
so yeah KP start moving in and start

5934.44 --> 5939.5199999999995
started well addressing things that I

5938.239 --> 5943.239
talked

5939.52 --> 5946.119000000001
about so I that's when that problem

5943.239 --> 5946.119
seizes to

5952.56 --> 5959.679
be and yeah to me that's I mean what's

5956.48 --> 5963.5599999999995
the logic behind

5959.679 --> 5965.84
oh I complain about nobody speaking and

5963.56 --> 5969.599
that's why everybody stops

5965.84 --> 5969.599
talking that makes no

5974.88 --> 5981.76
sense so everybody doesn't talk because

5978.76 --> 5985.280000000001
of something they want to

5981.76 --> 5988.52
prevent me from doing when not talking

5985.28 --> 5990.4
is exactly what causes that thing that

5988.52 --> 5993.679
they aim to

5990.4 --> 5997.119
prevent by not talking that's literally

5993.679 --> 5997.119
paradoxical Lucy

6006.0 --> 6012.56
level right but I mean KP here had some

6008.92 --> 6013.76
really good comments and I addressed

6012.56 --> 6017.76
pretty much

6013.76 --> 6020.599
everything you've twisted that up a bit

6017.76 --> 6024.0
no I did not twist that up a bit that's

6020.599 --> 6026.52
quite literal I did not twist anybody's

6024.0 --> 6026.52
words

6039.159 --> 6044.04
here right let's finish up this

6059.88 --> 6062.88
all

6097.76 --> 6103.280000000001
oh look who's decided to show up 2 and a

6100.4 --> 6105.96
half hours after I normally start the

6103.28 --> 6107.84
show which could very well mean that

6105.96 --> 6109.84
that's right around the point where I

6107.84 --> 6114.84
would round out the show if nobody had

6109.84 --> 6114.84
shown up hi akumu virus

6132.84 --> 6139.56
oh god oh you're all going to move in

6136.28 --> 6142.08
now why did you just not move in why did

6139.56 --> 6144.360000000001
you just not show up yeah the show went

6142.08 --> 6147.4
absolutely perfect perfect without you

6144.36 --> 6150.48
showing up all of a sudden 2 and a half

6147.4 --> 6150.48
hours into the

6151.95 --> 6155.1089999999995
[Music]

6161.96 --> 6169.36
show no I did not misunderstand what you

6166.04 --> 6171.719
said I addressed everything that was

6169.36 --> 6175.679
said in the chat

6171.719 --> 6178.84
Lucy every that was said I addressed

6175.679 --> 6181.84
every single [ __ ] sentence that

6178.84 --> 6184.92
everybody said in the chat I have

6181.84 --> 6189.84
addressed and I did not address it 10

6184.92 --> 6189.84
minutes afterward I addressed it right

6193.84 --> 6199.04
away just so you can stop gaslighting me

6202.119 --> 6206.08
now for

6238.199 --> 6242.719
I didn't assess it right yeah well I

6240.599 --> 6245.159000000001
literally just corrected so you don't

6242.719 --> 6246.88
stay the [ __ ] out of it akumu virus

6245.159 --> 6250.638999999999
you're two and a half hours in why don't

6246.88 --> 6250.639
you just [ __ ] off

6271.4 --> 6276.5599999999995
you heard what she's talking about oh I

6273.48 --> 6278.718999999999
didn't know that you could listen to

6276.56 --> 6281.719
text on a

6278.719 --> 6281.719
screen

6291.56 --> 6296.280000000001
interesting I haven't addressed the chat

6293.96 --> 6298.76
for ages yeah but I didn't I have

6296.28 --> 6301.32
addressed the chat I addressed every

6298.76 --> 6304.320000000001
[ __ ] part of the chat what the hell

6301.32 --> 6304.32
are you blabbering

6304.56 --> 6312.2390000000005
about what you're going to remind me of

6309.0 --> 6315.719
what happens sometimes when specifically

6312.239 --> 6318.5599999999995
that isn't actually happening right

6315.719 --> 6321.88
now yeah that is

6318.56 --> 6324.400000000001
gaslighting cuz that suggests by the

6321.88 --> 6327.08
nature of you bringing it up that that's

6324.4 --> 6330.839999999999
what's going on when it clearly isn't

6327.08 --> 6334.88
because I addressed every damn sentence

6330.84 --> 6334.88
that everybody said this entire

6344.32 --> 6352.5199999999995
show I just scroll back and see what the

6347.719 --> 6352.52
[ __ ] is you are you blabbering about

6376.52 --> 6380.4400000000005
I mean there's only one weird ass

6378.719 --> 6384.8
sentence that I didn't address and

6380.44 --> 6387.678999999999
that's can bacteria sin big questions or

6384.8 --> 6391.08
stupid questions since sin only involve

6387.679 --> 6394.4800000000005
Consciousness and bacteria are not

6391.08 --> 6397.48
conscious like we are so of course sin

6394.48 --> 6397.48
doesn't apply to

6398.92 --> 6406.56
them would you like to be well yeah

6403.44 --> 6409.638999999999
yeah you know what I don't want lucer

6406.56 --> 6413.8
level people whining and complaining

6409.639 --> 6413.8
about how I do the show

6414.159 --> 6421.879999999999
especially when I'm having a really good

6417.719 --> 6424.8
show with very concise

6421.88 --> 6427.56
relevant

6424.8 --> 6429.159000000001
information and being very fluid and

6427.56 --> 6433.8
yeah that's not the time to start

6429.159 --> 6433.799999999999
complaining about how I do the show

6466.32 --> 6471.4
yeah you do that you just shut up that's

6471.639 --> 6477.84
right or or stick to the damn

6475.04 --> 6480.96
subject actually stick to the subject

6477.84 --> 6484.159000000001
that I'm talking about instead of meta

6480.96 --> 6487.88
talking about how I do my show yeah

6484.159 --> 6487.879999999999
that's a great idea

6505.08 --> 6511.159
they're always ask about us no zipy

6508.119 --> 6514.4
nobody gives a [ __ ] nobody gives a [ __ ]

6511.159 --> 6517.199
that all you ballards suddenly all

6514.4 --> 6519.759999999999
simultaneously show up out of nowhere

6517.199 --> 6522.678999999999
all the at the same time two and a half

6519.76 --> 6526.08
hours into the show and just act like

6522.679 --> 6528.599
you own the place you don't prepare to

6526.08 --> 6530.4
be [ __ ] timed out because I don't

6528.599 --> 6532.4400000000005
actually feel like even having you

6530.4 --> 6536.08
around right now I was doing just

6532.44 --> 6536.08
perfect L fine without

6555.48 --> 6560.799999999999
you yeah yeah no they all shut up well

6558.44 --> 6563.799999999999
maybe they have other things they're

6560.8 --> 6563.8
doing

6565.76 --> 6573.04
at least they didn't show up two and a

6569.04 --> 6573.04
half hours into the show

6587.28 --> 6591.88
huh hey Jason mccac

6607.8 --> 6612.599
yeah see so this is where the section

6610.08 --> 6614.76
ends of actually being really

6612.599 --> 6617.119000000001
interesting and relevant and this is the

6614.76 --> 6620.4800000000005
section where I suddenly start to now

6617.119 --> 6624.719
have to rearrange everything because a

6620.48 --> 6627.759999999999
bunch of blabbering dimwit did [ __ ]

6624.719 --> 6630.599
entered my chat and that's going to like

6627.76 --> 6633.360000000001
literally now make it impossible to have

6630.599 --> 6636.400000000001
an interesting subject at hand now

6633.36 --> 6639.639
because they and their blabbering

6636.4 --> 6643.239
barded blabber mouths are just going to

6639.639 --> 6648.52
[ __ ] ruin it again as they always do

6643.239 --> 6651.839999999999
yeah bards arriving in my chat like a

6648.52 --> 6654.400000000001
cluster is never led to me actually

6651.84 --> 6656.32
addressing any anything interesting ever

6654.4 --> 6659.159
yeah and that's why I'm actually

6656.32 --> 6660.36
inclined to just time you out 24 hours

6659.159 --> 6664.36
right

6660.36 --> 6667.839999999999
now cuz I had a great show until you

6664.36 --> 6667.839999999999
showed up

6694.76 --> 6703.599
yeah whatever yeah yeah you're timed out

6698.119 --> 6703.598999999999
bye you can [ __ ] off too

6704.199 --> 6712.32
bye and you too bye now [ __ ] off

6737.8 --> 6743.320000000001
can you not ban them for good

6740.4 --> 6745.759999999999
no I don't want to ban them for good I

6743.32 --> 6748.199
just don't want a good show to be ruined

6745.76 --> 6748.1990000000005
by their

6748.92 --> 6753.84
presence doesn't mean that I'm going to

6751.04 --> 6756.079
have a great show every single

6753.84 --> 6757.079
time right there's a time and a place

6756.079 --> 6759.92
for

6757.079 --> 6760.84
everything now is not the time for

6759.92 --> 6763.4400000000005
[ __ ]

6760.84 --> 6766.92
ballards dragging everything down into

6763.44 --> 6766.919999999999
the [ __ ] hole

6802.199 --> 6807.598999999999
sometimes you show up an hour into your

6804.52 --> 6811.040000000001
no I don't show up an hour into I've

6807.599 --> 6813.599
never been an hour late like not one

6811.04 --> 6817.239
time I've never been an hour

6813.599 --> 6819.52
late been always less than an hour late

6817.239 --> 6823.678999999999
if I'd be more than an hour late I

6819.52 --> 6823.679
usually cancel the show

6845.48 --> 6848.48
that's

6865.48 --> 6871.199
right so don't forget the Rogan it up

6868.239 --> 6871.199
the show that

6874.52 --> 6883.280000000001
is I mean I got two thumbs up that's

6878.239 --> 6885.36
ridiculous there's been like four steady

6883.28 --> 6888.599
participants here

6885.36 --> 6893.839999999999
in all of my conversations there should

6888.599 --> 6893.84
be more thumbs up this is ridiculous

6899.48 --> 6903.04
Father's Day weekend

6903.59 --> 6908.639
[Music]

6906.079 --> 6912.199
what

6908.639 --> 6912.1990000000005
oh didn't know

6921.32 --> 6928.239
that on your way to

6924.239 --> 6928.239
golf okay

6968.119 --> 6974.239
right so uh any more questions

6970.36 --> 6974.239
concerning uh the medical

6975.04 --> 6979.04
system sickness

6984.199 --> 6988.04
I I know I put down a whole

6988.119 --> 6994.159
bunch it's good

6990.679 --> 6997.04
information it's durable like it will be

6994.159 --> 6997.04
relevant in the

7002.0 --> 7007.639
future but maybe some of you can

7005.4 --> 7010.199
actually ask questions that I had not

7007.639 --> 7010.1990000000005
thought of

7011.239 --> 7020.36
yet cure for

7014.079 --> 7020.36
diabetes uh yeah diabetes can be

7023.96 --> 7031.0
cured depends though on the nature of it

7027.0 --> 7036.52
I mean it is a little bit more

7031.0 --> 7036.52
complex type one I

7043.239 --> 7048.959999999999
right but I'm not it can be cured as far

7047.159 --> 7052.679
as I

7048.96 --> 7056.199
know but I'm not a specialist if you

7052.679 --> 7058.32
literally insulin dependent yeah that's

7056.199 --> 7059.879999999999
problematic yeah if you're insulin

7058.32 --> 7062.5199999999995
dependent and you keep taking it then

7059.88 --> 7066.04
you're not going to be healed from it I

7062.52 --> 7066.040000000001
guarantee it

7075.32 --> 7081.88
you have a cure for diabetes dude I had

7078.639 --> 7085.719
potentially developing

7081.88 --> 7085.719
diabetes I took care of

7097.04 --> 7104.119
it visible rainbow

7100.56 --> 7104.119000000001
what what is that

7112.28 --> 7119.119
K electricity and

7115.48 --> 7121.799999999999
life what oh with a giant Globe at the

7119.119 --> 7121.799999999999
front

7127.76 --> 7134.04
oh is that like a electric Universe

7131.28 --> 7134.04
related

7151.32 --> 7157.84
book what did I do to cure my potential

7154.76 --> 7161.2390000000005
diabetes dramatically cut down on all

7157.84 --> 7165.159000000001
forms of sugar especially the sugar in

7161.239 --> 7165.159
food it's now

7195.32 --> 7200.44
one is not like

7197.32 --> 7202.96
that right well if you have like a a

7200.44 --> 7206.759999999999
cute gold

7202.96 --> 7208.119
blather burnout thing where it just

7206.76 --> 7211.119000000001
doesn't work

7208.119 --> 7211.119
anymore

7211.239 --> 7219.959999999999
yeah I mean once like it completely

7216.079 --> 7222.679
loses the insulin regulating function

7219.96 --> 7224.44
entire like once that happens like

7222.679 --> 7228.52
there's technically nothing that you can

7224.44 --> 7231.32
do about it unless you want to like use

7228.52 --> 7233.4400000000005
stem cells or something to literally

7231.32 --> 7236.96
have the organ

7233.44 --> 7239.799999999999
reboot and grow new insulin systems

7236.96 --> 7242.88
which like I pretty sure that's actually

7239.8 --> 7247.76
doable you can actually do that

7242.88 --> 7250.4800000000005
basically restart your insulin

7247.76 --> 7253.92
system but I mean that's not like a

7250.48 --> 7253.919999999999
cheap procedure or anything

7255.88 --> 7261.8
right but as long as you're going to be

7258.44 --> 7265.079
dependent on external injections like

7261.8 --> 7265.079000000001
yeah it's never going to be

7265.52 --> 7273.679
fixed there's like no incentive for your

7268.44 --> 7273.678999999999
body to even want to fix your that

7274.0 --> 7277.199
organ the

7278.56 --> 7284.04
pancreas but yeah if that's if those BL

7281.599 --> 7287.04
the those microbladers that cause create

7284.04 --> 7290.0
the insulin in your pancreas if they're

7287.04 --> 7292.199
like completely burned out I think it's

7290.0 --> 7296.48
like some allergic reaction or something

7292.199 --> 7299.28
that does that then yeah it doesn't grow

7296.48 --> 7301.879999999999
back unless you have like the ideal

7299.28 --> 7303.44
circumstances you have to be a super

7301.88 --> 7307.599
super health

7303.44 --> 7310.678999999999
nut and super anti- sugar and then you

7307.599 --> 7313.079
might somehow kind of reboot the

7310.679 --> 7317.079
pancreas but otherwise you'd have to

7313.079 --> 7320.36
like use stem cell therapy or something

7317.079 --> 7320.36
to like restart

7326.32 --> 7333.199
it adus no I've not heard of anybody

7330.96 --> 7339.639
that you've ever brought up

7333.199 --> 7339.638999999999
duper uh a raw diet yeah raw diet

7340.32 --> 7343.84
great definitely

7353.96 --> 7358.28
raw DS are always better in that

7370.679 --> 7378.28
sense so supposedly has a cure for

7375.0 --> 7379.56
everything okay well yeah raw diets can

7378.28 --> 7382.48
almost cure

7379.56 --> 7385.400000000001
anything I mean it raw diet is like a

7382.48 --> 7388.4
part of the Gerson Therapy too Gerson

7385.4 --> 7390.879999999999
Therapy that like cures cancer even in

7388.4 --> 7390.879999999999
the late

7391.88 --> 7395.36
stage so

7395.84 --> 7402.52
yeah raw diet does deliver like the

7399.44 --> 7404.159
highest concentration of living food

7402.52 --> 7407.079000000001
living

7404.159 --> 7409.879999999999
nutrients CU if you process it even if

7407.079 --> 7413.159
you heat it like the life that is in

7409.88 --> 7414.88
there inherently it it does leave now

7413.159 --> 7417.92
you'll still get the nutrients but you

7414.88 --> 7421.119
won't get like the life Essence that

7417.92 --> 7421.119
comes with raw

7425.079 --> 7431.799999999999
food have I ever cured anyone of

7428.28 --> 7436.5199999999995
anything ever I've cured myself of tons

7431.8 --> 7439.599
of stuff I have not cured anybody else

7436.52 --> 7442.320000000001
of anything you can't cure anybody else

7439.599 --> 7444.84
you can tell them how they can cure

7442.32 --> 7448.599
themselves and then they might do

7444.84 --> 7448.599
it if they have the

7455.48 --> 7463.04
will he still believes in viruses well

7459.04 --> 7463.04
that's Laden

7465.599 --> 7471.1990000000005
oh Lucy level oh oh looks like

7468.719 --> 7475.2390000000005
somebody's a little trigger

7471.199 --> 7478.239
today oh I'm so full of myself I lack

7475.239 --> 7481.919999999999
selfawareness oh I'm not aware of how

7478.239 --> 7485.48
I'm acting no I am aware of how I'm

7481.92 --> 7488.4800000000005
acting and I'm just like this

7485.48 --> 7492.199
yeah this is how I

7488.48 --> 7495.36
am yeah I'm not a

7492.199 --> 7500.48
B I'm not like oh I don't want to hurt

7495.36 --> 7503.079
anybody's feelings oh no yeah [ __ ] your

7500.48 --> 7506.0
feelings yeah sometimes I'm just like

7503.079 --> 7508.84
that I'm just like hey [ __ ] your

7506.0 --> 7511.8
feelings I'm talking about real

7508.84 --> 7515.360000000001
[ __ ] if your feel if you allow your

7511.8 --> 7520.320000000001
feelings to get in the way of me talking

7515.36 --> 7522.159
about real [ __ ] then maybe my real

7520.32 --> 7525.159
information like

7522.159 --> 7527.36
it's like you're not worth it then if

7525.159 --> 7531.04
you allow your feelings to get in the

7527.36 --> 7533.5199999999995
way well maybe you're not worthy enough

7531.04 --> 7535.92
to actually assimilate the information

7533.52 --> 7537.719
that I'm sharing them cuz you're

7535.92 --> 7540.62
allowing your feelings to get in the way

7537.719 --> 7543.76
ever considered to think of it like

7540.62 --> 7543.76
[Music]

7546.559 --> 7551.92
that

7548.079 --> 7555.4
yeah so yeah I mean anytime anybody

7551.92 --> 7559.079
tells me you're lacking a bit of

7555.4 --> 7563.199
self-awareness that's always going to be

7559.079 --> 7565.88
purely asinine because I am so [ __ ]

7563.199 --> 7568.879999999999
self-aware is like a curse on me I am

7565.88 --> 7573.679
continually self-aware it's been like

7568.88 --> 7577.0
the the crutch in my life is freaking

7573.679 --> 7579.4400000000005
self-awareness yeah so you don't know

7577.0 --> 7583.079
what the [ __ ] you're talking

7579.44 --> 7586.839999999999
about you're just triggered

7583.079 --> 7589.0
and no I'm not going to tone it down for

7586.84 --> 7592.0
you because you're

7589.0 --> 7592.0
triggered

7603.88 --> 7608.88
okay I have cures for things to tell you

7606.76 --> 7611.079000000001
what to do what do you mean I don't tell

7608.88 --> 7614.8
you what to do I've told you everything

7611.079 --> 7616.599
what to do I literally told you you just

7614.8 --> 7618.52
didn't listen because you were [ __ ]

7616.599 --> 7621.88
triggered you thought it was more

7618.52 --> 7625.679
important to share with me how I was not

7621.88 --> 7627.84
doing it right or I lack

7625.679 --> 7629.119
self-awareness well apparently you're

7627.84 --> 7631.88
let your

7629.119 --> 7634.079
triggering make you

7631.88 --> 7637.92
elusive yeah you

7634.079 --> 7641.4
eluded the actual explanations that I

7637.92 --> 7641.4
gave to you

7645.92 --> 7651.1990000000005
what did I do to hold my diabetes I

7648.599 --> 7655.400000000001
dramatically improved my

7651.199 --> 7657.48
diet I already told you that yeah I got

7655.4 --> 7660.32
all the sugar out like that's where it

7657.48 --> 7664.159
starts now I got some of the sugar back

7660.32 --> 7668.44
I take sugar in my coffee but that's

7664.159 --> 7670.759999999999
after I took care of all of it because

7668.44 --> 7675.839999999999
to take care of diabetes is to like

7670.76 --> 7679.2390000000005
become aware of how or rather where all

7675.84 --> 7682.4800000000005
the sugars are that are be detrimental

7679.239 --> 7685.0
to your system you have to figure out

7682.48 --> 7685.0
where they

7685.159 --> 7688.719
are in what

7693.52 --> 7699.2390000000005
food it's all about awareness diabetes

7696.96 --> 7701.559
is all about awareness about what you're

7699.239 --> 7704.44
eating what that does to your system

7701.559 --> 7704.4400000000005
what do you actually

7705.239 --> 7711.119
need and what you're going to be

7707.36 --> 7714.48
addicted to because diabetes is always

7711.119 --> 7718.48
tied in with sugar addiction always no

7714.48 --> 7720.759999999999
exception it's always that always

7718.48 --> 7723.799999999999
there's no diabetic

7720.76 --> 7728.719
person that wasn't sugar

7723.8 --> 7728.719
addicted before they became diabetic

7744.92 --> 7751.32
what oh oh did that and did oh it's what

7748.96 --> 7755.079
the big inside and cure well the big

7751.32 --> 7757.48
inside and cure is you don't do what the

7755.079 --> 7760.96
[ __ ] doctor tells you to

7757.48 --> 7762.959999999999
do even better you don't go to a doctor

7760.96 --> 7765.199
you take take care of it yourself you

7762.96 --> 7768.44
just realize hey I've been overburdening

7789.8 --> 7795.119000000001
Universal solution it's even the

7792.159 --> 7800.04
solution for freaking tooth AE is just

7795.119 --> 7801.799999999999

7800.04 --> 7805.199
Panic don't

7801.8 --> 7806.599
surrender to a medical Authority that's

7805.199 --> 7809.159
going to like

7806.599 --> 7814.159000000001
alter your

7809.159 --> 7814.159
physiology for some shortterm easy

7818.32 --> 7822.759999999999
solution yeah the Cure is stop thinking

7822.44 --> 7825.799
it's

7822.76 --> 7825.799
[Music]

7833.559 --> 7841.8
incurable just listen to your

7837.8 --> 7841.8
body and be

7841.88 --> 7846.88
consequential don't just be like oh but

7844.84 --> 7850.8
oh if I have to listen to my body and

7846.88 --> 7853.88
adapt everything that I do to that thing

7850.8 --> 7856.559
I don't why you do that I don't want to

7853.88 --> 7859.84
rearrange my

7856.559 --> 7863.4800000000005
life I was just doing so well and this

7859.84 --> 7866.84
happened why is this in my way yeah well

7863.48 --> 7869.4
then you're never going to cure it ever

7866.84 --> 7873.719
ever and it's going to be your crutch

7869.4 --> 7876.48
forever until you die then yeah it's

7873.719 --> 7876.4800000000005
that [ __ ]

7876.599 --> 7881.400000000001
mindset thinking that you're just like

7879.239 --> 7885.04
oh you could just do whatever the [ __ ]

7881.4 --> 7887.239
you want no you can't you can't just do

7885.04 --> 7890.719
whatever the [ __ ] you want if you do

7887.239 --> 7894.199
whatever the [ __ ] you want you end up

7890.719 --> 7896.639
being a detriment to parts of your body

7894.199 --> 7899.96
that are then going to eventually give

7896.639 --> 7902.159000000001
up on you permanently because you

7899.96 --> 7903.119
thought it was more important to do what

7902.159 --> 7908.719
you

7903.119 --> 7908.719
wanted yeah that's how it works

7922.32 --> 7926.719
you think you have a cancer cure too did

7924.96 --> 7929.76
you say

7926.719 --> 7933.4800000000005
yeah yeah it's the same

7929.76 --> 7933.4800000000005
thing same

7939.92 --> 7948.88
thing I probably had

7943.36 --> 7951.5199999999995
cancer several times yeah I just didn't

7948.88 --> 7954.76
Panic of over it I just consider it's

7951.52 --> 7957.040000000001
like oh that's my body fixing itself

7954.76 --> 7958.679
we're born with cancer we're like got 20

7957.04 --> 7962.44
types of different types of cancer in

7958.679 --> 7965.4
our bodies since birth they're there in

7962.44 --> 7968.199
equilibrium they have a function oh you

7965.4 --> 7970.638999999999
get a cancer well then you had a

7968.199 --> 7973.96
problem yeah German new medicine tells

7970.639 --> 7976.559
you exact how this works you get cancer

7973.96 --> 7977.719
in response to emotional trauma that

7976.559 --> 7980.92
gets

7977.719 --> 7985.36
resolved not the emotional trauma being

7980.92 --> 7987.84
there no it getting resolved it fixing

7985.36 --> 7990.839999999999
itself then you get the cancer the

7987.84 --> 7993.679
cancer is a repair process it gives you

7990.84 --> 7996.119000000001
discomfort all you have to do is not

7993.679 --> 7998.92
panic like a [ __ ]

7996.119 --> 8001.28
[ __ ] like most people because they

7998.92 --> 8003.2390000000005
listen to Too Much medical science

8001.28 --> 8005.599
fiction about how cancer is this

8003.239 --> 8008.079
invasive thing and you have to have war

8005.599 --> 8011.2390000000005
on it war on the

8008.079 --> 8014.28
cancer what war on your repairing

8011.239 --> 8017.199
mechanism in your body you [ __ ]

8014.28 --> 8020.92
idiots yeah yeah guess how things go

8017.199 --> 8023.678999999999
wrong by declaring war on inherent

8020.92 --> 8027.76
aspects of your own physiology yeah

8023.679 --> 8027.76
that's how things go wrong

8043.84 --> 8051.400000000001
so when I become ill which you will one

8047.8 --> 8053.84
day what are you talking about Steven

8138.8 --> 8144.079000000001
[ __ ] itself as far as I'm concerned it

8141.079 --> 8148.04
should be entirely

8144.079 --> 8150.59
replaced it's redundant Superfluous

8148.04 --> 8153.669
outdated archaic

8150.59 --> 8153.669

8171.8 --> 8177.719
my body fix it by not panicking not

8175.119 --> 8180.96
think oh it's the end yeah no it's not

it's just oh my body is just fixing

8183.079 --> 8186.599
itself that's why I'm Ill

8192.08 --> 8198.039999999999
now

8194.399 --> 8201.039999999999
yeah it's very

8198.04 --> 8204.439
simple never been to a yeah in I've have

8201.04 --> 8204.439
been to a dentist in the

8208.319 --> 8215.199999999999
past yeah but I only went to the dentist

8211.719 --> 8218.16
because ouchie it hurt I wanted the pain

8215.2 --> 8220.84
to stop yeah and they made them do all

8218.16 --> 8224.08
these things in retrospect if I hadn't

8220.84 --> 8226.479
had the dentist do all these things my

8224.08 --> 8230.24
my teeth would probably be in it

8226.479 --> 8234.519
literally be in a better condition

8230.24 --> 8236.639
now yeah if I hadn't done that but hey

8234.519 --> 8239.519
pain is a scary thing especially when

8236.639 --> 8242.639
you're younger and you still have this

8239.519 --> 8245.479
delusional this West delusion like oh

8242.639 --> 8247.0
you're supposed to not experience that

8245.479 --> 8248.96
yeah you are you're supposed to

8247.0 --> 8251.599
experience that it's a direct warning

8248.96 --> 8252.678999999998
sign it's a warning sign hey your diet

8251.599 --> 8256.479
is

8252.679 --> 8259.84
shitty you're eating Terrible Things

8256.479 --> 8262.96
yeah that's going to avenge itself

8259.84 --> 8266.399
primarily in tooth AE and if you

8262.96 --> 8269.199999999999
then like keep doing it then other parts

8266.399 --> 8273.119999999999
of your body are going to get messed

8269.2 --> 8275.639000000001
up cuz you're not eating right too much

8273.12 --> 8275.639000000001
candy

8285.439 --> 8290.800000000001
[ __ ] so I never visited a dentist in the

8288.559 --> 8293.399
last couple years yeah I did actually

8290.8 --> 8295.399
one time and it was immediately sorry I

8293.399 --> 8299.08
did that

8295.399 --> 8302.119999999999
immediately cuz they effectively cost

8299.08 --> 8303.84
tons of money and did not accomplish a

8302.12 --> 8306.0
single thing that I couldn't have done

8303.84 --> 8309.519
myself and it was really [ __ ]

8306.0 --> 8311.8
embarrassed for what I've done

8309.519 --> 8313.12
afterward and it's the last time I'm

8311.8 --> 8317.199999999999
going to

8313.12 --> 8318.479000000001
go that's now two or three years ago I'm

8317.2 --> 8321.319000000001
not entirely

8318.479 --> 8324.039999999999
sure but I'm still embarrassed that I

8321.319 --> 8324.039999999999
actually did

8327.679 --> 8334.319
that what do I do if I broke a limb well

8330.92 --> 8336.599
first off I don't break a limb and if I

8334.319 --> 8339.92
did broke a limb well then I probably

8336.599 --> 8343.679
would go to a doctor cuz I

8339.92 --> 8346.24
mean that's a very simple relatively

8343.679 --> 8350.479
noninvasive procedure that

8346.24 --> 8353.8
is quite useful setting a broken limb

8350.479 --> 8355.92
straight that's actually really basic

8353.8 --> 8359.358999999999
it's one of the few things I would trust

8355.92 --> 8361.960000000001
to a doctor yeah or like oh you get into

8359.359 --> 8364.519
an accident somebody like drives right

8361.96 --> 8367.719
into you with a car and you open up a

8364.519 --> 8370.0
big wound in your leg well then I want a

8367.719 --> 8374.639
surgeon to put it back together

8370.0 --> 8378.0
absolutely yeah but

8374.639 --> 8380.279999999999
uh I just make sure that doesn't happen

8378.0 --> 8381.84
I haven't been in an

8380.28 --> 8387.439
accident

8381.84 --> 8391.479
ever ever not one [ __ ] time in my

8387.439 --> 8394.720000000001
life I've seen people literally get into

8391.479 --> 8398.119999999999
accidents right around me right next to

8394.72 --> 8400.16
me right in front of me and I never got

8398.12 --> 8403.640000000001
into an accient because I I see those

8400.16 --> 8405.28
things coming and I manage to avoid it

8403.64 --> 8408.039999999999
ahead of

8405.28 --> 8410.04
time I don't get into accidents and I

8408.04 --> 8413.68
never

8410.04 --> 8413.68
will I know I

8417.359 --> 8424.6
want so got any more shitty shitty but

8422.24 --> 8427.039999999999
but you're going to go do it right

8424.6 --> 8429.439
eventually you will

8427.04 --> 8433.04
Arwin oh you're you're we're going to

8429.439 --> 8435.24
find your hypocrisy you will eventually

8433.04 --> 8437.720000000001
surrender to the medical system and then

8435.24 --> 8440.439
you have to tell everybody it's not that

8437.72 --> 8442.479
bad right right that that's what you're

8440.439 --> 8445.880000000001
doing right now isn't it

8442.479 --> 8448.24
Lucy yeah think I don't know what it is

8445.88 --> 8450.399
that you're doing right now how dare you

8448.24 --> 8453.52
Arwin how dare you reject the medical

8450.399 --> 8454.399
system you might need it one day except

8453.52 --> 8459.399000000001
I

8454.399 --> 8462.08
don't I don't need it one day

8459.399 --> 8464.479
yeah what you think I haven't thought

8462.08 --> 8467.72
any of this through that I haven't

8464.479 --> 8470.16
thought all of it through all the time

8467.72 --> 8471.519999999999
for like [ __ ] 20 years you think I

8470.16 --> 8474.439
haven't thought it

8471.52 --> 8478.92
through when thinking things through is

8474.439 --> 8483.04
literally all I ever do with my

8478.92 --> 8485.319
life yeah that's all I do it's the only

8483.04 --> 8490.399000000001
[ __ ] thing I do with my life is think

8485.319 --> 8493.6
things through you get it it's all I

8490.399 --> 8497.08
do that's like the only thing I even do

8493.6 --> 8499.720000000001
with my life is think things

8497.08 --> 8502.92
through I have thought it through and I

8499.72 --> 8506.09
know what I'm talking about

8502.92 --> 8506.09
[Music]

8522.56 --> 8528.64
we just normal talk about it it's

8525.479 --> 8531.96
interesting yeah well very interesting

8528.64 --> 8531.96
isn't it

8542.28 --> 8547.76
the main cure for diseases is stop being

8545.04 --> 8547.76
a [ __ ]

8553.68 --> 8560.76
[ __ ] yeah that's that's the main cure

8557.319 --> 8560.76
stop being

8567.399 --> 8572.68
weak why are you working for why all the

8570.16 --> 8575.319
question questions Lucy why are you

8572.68 --> 8579.2
continually just questioning everything

8575.319 --> 8583.24
like not having a good question but just

8579.2 --> 8585.6
questioning what I do why I do

8583.24 --> 8588.76
it why are you doing this why are you

8585.6 --> 8591.04
doing that why are you keep whining with

8588.76 --> 8594.92
all these questions about how I do

8591.04 --> 8597.720000000001
things and why yeah stop questioning my

8594.92 --> 8602.439
resolve stop questioning what I do I do

8597.72 --> 8602.438999999998
what I do for a good reason

8605.2 --> 8610.640000000001
don't you just stop trying to undermine

8607.8 --> 8613.16
me all the time Lucy because that's what

8610.64 --> 8616.039999999999
you've been doing most of this show is

8613.16 --> 8616.039999999999
undermine

8616.08 --> 8622.8
me don't deny it that's exactly what

8619.359 --> 8622.800000000001
you've been doing

8659.16 --> 8664.709
ah

8661.55 --> 8664.708999999999
[Music]

8675.76 --> 8680.279
you're train and you're seeing it is

8677.88 --> 8684.839999999998
whining and being defensive yeah because

8680.279 --> 8687.6
it is you're gr cous yeah well I already

8684.84 --> 8687.6
shared it with

8688.319 --> 8692.84
you I already told you what you could

8694.96 --> 8702.479
do yeah my mom had

8699.12 --> 8702.479000000001
diabetes in the

8703.16 --> 8707.319
end it was a big bother to her I have

8706.56 --> 8710.278999999999
that

8707.319 --> 8714.399
tendency and I've mastered it all you

8710.279 --> 8718.359
have to do is be more careful with

8714.399 --> 8721.24
sugar and things like candy and

8718.359 --> 8724.359
cookies stop eating cookies iies best

8721.24 --> 8727.88
advice to avoid diabetes ever stop

8724.359 --> 8731.04
eating cookies it's the number one cause

8727.88 --> 8734.8
is cookies that's my finding it's the

8731.04 --> 8735.84
cookies alcohol too drinking beer not

8734.8 --> 8739.759999999998
good for

8735.84 --> 8743.399
diabetes drinking strong liquor with

8739.76 --> 8749.479
like sugar in it even worse deadly for

8743.399 --> 8749.479
diabetes but cookies number one cause

8751.12 --> 8757.12
it's kind of hard to find

8753.16 --> 8762.279
somebody that got diabetes that didn't

8757.12 --> 8765.08
like cookies yeah there's a puzzle for

8762.279 --> 8767.479000000001
you not saying that if you like cookies

8765.08 --> 8769.96
you will always get diabetes but if you

8767.479 --> 8771.16
get diabetes it's very unlikely you

8769.96 --> 8775.399
didn't like

8771.16 --> 8775.399
cookies now you figure that one

8776.64 --> 8782.24
out what about smoking is that bad for

8779.72 --> 8782.24
you

8783.72 --> 8787.16
uh in a

8787.279 --> 8791.640000000001
way it all depends on what you're

8789.56 --> 8793.68
smoking how you're smoking how much

8791.64 --> 8797.119999999999
you're smoking how many times you are

8793.68 --> 8800.0
smoking and if you eat properly in order

8797.12 --> 8802.880000000001
to regenerate the damage because there

8800.0 --> 8806.16
is a continual damage that happens with

8802.88 --> 8811.08
the smoking because of the nature of the

8806.16 --> 8811.08
toxins that are part of smoking

8815.8 --> 8819.96
but uh yeah smoking does not cause

8826.04 --> 8831.720000000001
diabetes ignore the cancer I never said

8828.8 --> 8834.199999999999
ignore the cancer did anybody here

8831.72 --> 8834.199999999999
Steven

8834.319 --> 8841.6
Jarvis yeah

8836.76 --> 8846.960000000001
Optimus T TK what was KP did did I say

8841.6 --> 8851.6
ignore cancer no no seems like you're

8846.96 --> 8854.599999999999
like just slightly rearranging the words

8851.6 --> 8858.479000000001
in a certain direction here Lucy

8854.6 --> 8858.479000000001
starting to notice a pattern here

8860.99 --> 8864.119999999999
[Music]

8867.279 --> 8872.560000000001
Lucy you're having dinner okay up to

8871.12 --> 8876.0
have a nice

8872.56 --> 8878.16
meal oh man it's late yeah I started

8876.0 --> 8880.72
late so it's my

8878.16 --> 8884.24
fault yeah I didn't say ignore the

8880.72 --> 8888.76
cancer I just said don't see it like

8884.24 --> 8893.119999999999
it's your enemy don't to war on cancer

8888.76 --> 8894.92
that's what I said I did not say ignore

8893.12 --> 8897.52
it

8894.92 --> 8901.88
yeah how

8897.52 --> 8901.880000000001
interesting that you would

8903.12 --> 8912.359
reformat what you thought I was saying

8907.279 --> 8912.359
like that how interesting how very

8927.88 --> 8933.479
telling do you even know what time one

8930.439 --> 8934.84
diabetes is well type one diabetes is

8933.479 --> 8937.278999999999
like the

8934.84 --> 8941.279
complete uh it's like an allergic

8937.279 --> 8945.0
reaction that like destroys

8941.279 --> 8947.960000000001
the the pancreas function to create the

8945.0 --> 8950.72
insulin thing is what I

8947.96 --> 8955.08
understand uh in order to prevent that

8950.72 --> 8957.76
from happening well my recommendation is

8955.08 --> 8960.88
like don't take any medical experiments

8957.76 --> 8963.84
of any sort even the basic one even the

8960.88 --> 8966.479
ones that are like classic

8963.84 --> 8970.16
yeah

8966.479 --> 8972.8
cuz that's sort of diabetes type one

8970.16 --> 8976.279
like that is like allergic reaction

8972.8 --> 8977.8
related well that comes from a natural

8976.279 --> 8981.12
medical

8977.8 --> 8983.599999999999
intervention it's usually that people

8981.12 --> 8983.6
that get

8984.6 --> 8990.880000000001
it I mean I'd like to hear of an example

8988.84 --> 8994.08
of somebody that had the this type 1

8990.88 --> 8996.039999999999
diabetes that did not have any kind of

8994.08 --> 8999.08
medical intervention

8996.04 --> 9002.12
whatsoever yeah how many people do you

8999.08 --> 9005.039999999999
know that are Amish that have type 1

9002.12 --> 9007.92
diabetes

9005.04 --> 9010.6
huh you probably don't know any Amish

9007.92 --> 9013.439
people but I can tell you yeah they

9010.6 --> 9015.880000000001
don't have type one diabetes yeah yeah

9013.439 --> 9017.6
you know why because they don't do

9015.88 --> 9021.599999999999
medical

9017.6 --> 9025.84
interventions and they have Raw diets of

9021.6 --> 9029.359
produce that they make

9025.84 --> 9032.16
themselves yeah and that's how you don't

9029.359 --> 9032.16
get type 1

9034.68 --> 9041.479000000001
diabetes yeah it's just like uh what's

9037.72 --> 9043.8
what are these other diseases uh a

9041.479 --> 9047.438999999998
terrible thing that

9043.8 --> 9050.399
uh what that Stephen Hawkins had that

9047.439 --> 9052.439
terrible terrible condition yeah now

9050.399 --> 9056.039999999999
guess what I don't remember what the

9052.439 --> 9059.04
hell the name was but yeah people that

9056.04 --> 9061.640000000001
get that condition yeah yeah yeah

9059.04 --> 9065.6
there's no Amish that get that yeah

9061.64 --> 9067.24
there only people that participate in

9065.6 --> 9071.399000000001
medical

9067.24 --> 9073.24
interventions have certain procedures

9071.399 --> 9077.439
done

9073.24 --> 9080.359
certain things that get inserted into

9077.439 --> 9082.34
them bypassing the

9080.359 --> 9083.960000000001
like

9082.34 --> 9087.52
[Music]

9083.96 --> 9087.519999999999
the what do you call

9088.52 --> 9093.76
it the stomach barrier basically like

9091.399 --> 9095.039999999999
directly into your bloodstream right

9093.76 --> 9096.880000000001
that that sort of thing medical

9095.04 --> 9099.960000000001
intervention that's basically what that

9096.88 --> 9100.96
is yeah yeah that's what typically leads

9099.96 --> 9102.519999999999
to

9100.96 --> 9105.679999999998
these

9102.52 --> 9109.16
weird conditions and terrible diseases

9105.68 --> 9112.76
because people that never do that ever

9109.16 --> 9118.2
they never take any kind of medical

9112.76 --> 9122.12
intervention yeah they don't get those

9118.2 --> 9125.6
diseases those diseases don't

9122.12 --> 9126.640000000001
exist before that kind of thing was done

9125.6 --> 9131.56
to the

9126.64 --> 9134.56
public they never existed before medical

9131.56 --> 9134.56
intervention

9144.8 --> 9148.92
did tell you or instinctively know like

9147.479 --> 9151.039999999999
some kind of superhero yeah

9148.92 --> 9154.56
instinctively no like a some kind of

9151.04 --> 9158.279
superhero it's called figuring it out

9154.56 --> 9162.199999999999
putting everything together and then

9158.279 --> 9164.880000000001
knowing yeah it's called saying certain

9162.2 --> 9167.12
things and then not getting an immediate

9164.88 --> 9169.16
response to tell you oh no no no no

9167.12 --> 9170.92
you're actually wrong because uh yeah

9169.16 --> 9172.84
right before or the time when people

9170.92 --> 9175.24
started doing medical intervention in

9172.84 --> 9176.72
the west as a standard procedure oh

9175.24 --> 9180.0
there were plenty of people that had

9176.72 --> 9182.199999999999
that disease like no no they didn't did

9180.0 --> 9184.399
they yeah yeah because it's not the

9182.2 --> 9187.319000000001
first time I've said that and not the

9184.399 --> 9190.68
first time that nobody immediately

9187.319 --> 9192.68
corrected me because I'm right and

9190.68 --> 9194.92
that's how I figure out that I'm right

9192.68 --> 9197.52
about these things I make statements

9194.92 --> 9198.6
nobody corrects me cuz it turns out I

9197.52 --> 9201.68
was

9198.6 --> 9205.880000000001
correct and now I can keep repeating

9201.68 --> 9205.880000000001
that statement because it is

9209.68 --> 9215.84
correct oh you don't agree with this

9212.2 --> 9215.84
well that's your problem

9231.479 --> 9236.119999999999
yeah and I'm not talking about receiving

9234.0 --> 9238.96
medical help like getting an accident

9236.12 --> 9240.68
and then getting patched back up yeah

9238.96 --> 9243.519999999999
that's not what I'm talking about when I

9240.68 --> 9243.52
say medical

9249.12 --> 9254.479000000001
intervention I'm talking very

9251.359 --> 9257.12
specifically about getting substances

9254.479 --> 9261.24
inserted into your

9257.12 --> 9265.08
system bypassing the the normal way of

9261.24 --> 9266.279
consuming things yeah like you like

9265.08 --> 9270.12
through a

9266.279 --> 9272.6
syringe directly into your muscle tissue

9270.12 --> 9275.08
yeah I'm just not going to say the

9272.6 --> 9277.04
word yeah I'm not going to actually

9275.08 --> 9279.319
describe that I I am going to prevent

9277.04 --> 9283.279
that at all cost because I've had like

9279.319 --> 9286.039999999999
20 to 50 videos [ __ ] taken down on my

9283.279 --> 9288.439
show on this channel because I

9286.04 --> 9291.52
specifically didn't do that I didn't

9288.439 --> 9293.6
cover for it because I just had to say

9291.52 --> 9295.2
it as it is and now those videos are

9293.6 --> 9297.720000000001
gone and I don't want to risk that

9295.2 --> 9300.720000000001
happening anymore I'm very sorry for the

9297.72 --> 9300.72
inconvenience

9325.12 --> 9333.0
taking for effects is's an issue

9329.52 --> 9333.0
here yeah I'm

9333.279 --> 9339.04
sure I mean it's very simple at this

9336.6 --> 9340.439
point everything you would say applies

9339.04 --> 9343.0
to

9340.439 --> 9345.6
yourself everything everything you said

9343.0 --> 9345.6
applies to

9346.64 --> 9351.16
you and that's fine

9351.279 --> 9356.68
yeah everybody gets stuck into a denial

9354.04 --> 9360.640000000001
in denial spiral sometimes especially

9356.68 --> 9364.08
when they can't handle the truth and

9360.64 --> 9367.72
then fail to discontinue the the thing

9364.08 --> 9367.72
that you're doing that caused

9368.319 --> 9372.84
that then you continue and you continue

9371.24 --> 9374.319
in denial and then you're going to live

9372.84 --> 9376.84
in a revers world and then you're going

9374.319 --> 9379.399
to project your predicament on the

9376.84 --> 9381.6
opponent byp passing the realization

9379.399 --> 9383.199999999999
that it's you who's doing that and

9381.6 --> 9386.359
that's what's going to keep

9383.2 --> 9389.359
happening everybody does that

9386.359 --> 9389.359
sometime

9396.8 --> 9403.358999999999
luy it's called being stuck in the

9399.479 --> 9407.119999999999
reverse World getting everything 100%

9403.359 --> 9409.640000000001
wrong accusing your opponent or your

9407.12 --> 9411.08
declared to be opponent of everything

9409.64 --> 9413.92
that you

9411.08 --> 9416.039999999999
do yeah everybody gets stuck in that

9413.92 --> 9419.92
sometimes especially when you're facing

9416.04 --> 9423.279
information that you refuse to

9419.92 --> 9423.279
handle or

9436.92 --> 9442.92
accept hope that your potential diabetes

9439.8 --> 9446.92
by reducing sugar intake not just that

9442.92 --> 9449.88
but it yes becoming aware of sugar

9446.92 --> 9452.24
intake and being much more rigorous with

9449.88 --> 9456.759999999998
my overall diet because it's not just

9452.24 --> 9460.76
sugar it's the overall eating of food uh

9456.76 --> 9462.68
adopting a level of fasting and that

9460.76 --> 9464.800000000001
doesn't mean like hardcore fasting like

9462.68 --> 9468.12
not eating the entire day only drinking

9464.8 --> 9471.358999999999
water or something but just like

9468.12 --> 9473.2
accepting eating being less accepting

9471.359 --> 9476.2
that there are going to be phases in

9473.2 --> 9478.479000000001
your Waking Life where you're going to

9476.2 --> 9482.640000000001
seem to be hungry and that you have to

9478.479 --> 9485.16
like accept that yeah that too it's not

9482.64 --> 9487.358999999999
just reducing sugar intake because if

9485.16 --> 9489.68
you reduce sugar intake you're probably

9487.359 --> 9491.92
going to replace it with something

9489.68 --> 9493.800000000001
else it's like oh well I'm just going to

9491.92 --> 9496.72
eat more bread well that bread is going

9493.8 --> 9501.358999999999
to break down into guess what sugar

9496.72 --> 9501.358999999999
because that's what that is yeah

9502.24 --> 9510.0
so no it's the overall food behavior and

9507.04 --> 9510.0
like

9510.12 --> 9515.0
just dealing with eating

9516.6 --> 9523.399000000001
differently eating overall less not just

9520.84 --> 9526.359
less sugar but it started with eating

9523.399 --> 9527.8
less sugar and then moving on getting

9526.359 --> 9531.24
even better at

9527.8 --> 9534.519999999999
it eating more healthy eating

9531.24 --> 9537.52
less accepting that there's like that

9534.52 --> 9541.279
there is actually a positive influence

9537.52 --> 9544.6
in not eating for a while that your

9541.279 --> 9546.68
body when enabling a fasting State can

9544.6 --> 9550.479000000001
regenerate a whole bunch of things

9546.68 --> 9552.76
including your pancreas yeah overall

9550.479 --> 9556.16
regeneration like that overall

9552.76 --> 9559.52
regenerations from fasting regenerates

9556.16 --> 9561.92
everything all your weak spots

9559.52 --> 9565.24
yeah fasting like literally

9561.92 --> 9567.76
regenerates agitation like in my jaw

9565.24 --> 9569.119999999999
where I have typical issues that I

9567.76 --> 9570.68
probably have

9569.12 --> 9574.960000000001
forever

9570.68 --> 9578.84
yeah it will restore my pancreas it will

9574.96 --> 9582.64
restore my back that might have like

9578.84 --> 9585.319
issues of proper uh blood flow whatever

9582.64 --> 9588.399
like all typical issue like it fixes

9585.319 --> 9591.16
things and it will also fix Tendencies

9588.399 --> 9594.24
to diabetes

9591.16 --> 9598.2
so yeah it started with less sugar and

9594.24 --> 9599.8
then overall like a more balanced more

9598.2 --> 9603.560000000001
modest

9599.8 --> 9606.199999999999
diet helps tons and you're going to do

9603.56 --> 9609.0
that the rest of your life then cuz if I

9606.2 --> 9611.04
just think like yeah you know what I've

9609.0 --> 9612.84
been healthy and screw it I'm just going

9611.04 --> 9614.359
to do this and that again yeah well

9612.84 --> 9616.279
guess what guess what's going to come

9614.359 --> 9621.319
back very very

9616.279 --> 9621.319000000001
quickly yeah because that's how it is

9622.18 --> 9625.309000000001
[Music]

9629.2 --> 9635.720000000001
Lucy remind you of poison yeah it kind

9631.84 --> 9637.76
of is yeah but I mean like everything's

9635.72 --> 9640.438999999998
I call it everything she's doing now is

9637.76 --> 9642.84
pure projection pure

9640.439 --> 9646.52
projection he's feeling unwell no I'm

9642.84 --> 9648.24
feeling great me expressing myself like

9646.52 --> 9650.76
this is

9648.24 --> 9654.039999999999
exhilarating it's called freedom of

9650.76 --> 9658.56
expression I feel exhilarated being able

9654.04 --> 9661.52
to be as direct and honest as I am I'm

9658.56 --> 9664.16
not being like this because I'm

9661.52 --> 9666.52
frustrated I'm being like this because

9664.16 --> 9666.52
I'm

9666.96 --> 9674.278999999999
released I'm direct I'm released I'm

9670.64 --> 9675.64
honest I'm open I don't feel I need to

9674.279 --> 9679.960000000001
restrain

9675.64 --> 9684.16
myself with my directness yeah

9679.96 --> 9688.679999999998
so uh yeah that might make you feel

9684.16 --> 9688.68
unwell and then you project that onto

9692.439 --> 9697.720000000001
me right you're going to already admit

9695.319 --> 9701.278999999999
that you have less knowledge about this

9697.72 --> 9703.56
than me so why if you have less

9701.279 --> 9708.52
knowledge about this subject than me

9703.56 --> 9710.319
would you then proceed to analyze what

9708.52 --> 9713.76
my condition

9710.319 --> 9713.76
is about

9719.64 --> 9725.399
this oh you often feel unwell it's

9722.84 --> 9727.76
always feeling unwell really am I always

9725.399 --> 9727.76
feeling

9730.399 --> 9735.88
unwell okay so you say he's always

9732.88 --> 9739.679999999998
feeling unwell and now you say you often

9735.88 --> 9743.08
feel unwell not that you are unwell now

9739.68 --> 9746.16
well if I'm not unwell now then I'm not

9743.08 --> 9749.0
always feeling unwell now am I yeah

9746.16 --> 9753.399
that's you twisting it instantaneous

9749.0 --> 9756.12
preemptive projection there well done

9753.399 --> 9760.72
yeah everybody can see that and know

9756.12 --> 9760.720000000001
that I'm right that you're projecting

9763.6 --> 9769.16
instantaneously and I just read back

9766.24 --> 9771.72
what you said and pointed out how your

9769.16 --> 9771.72
contradicting

9771.76 --> 9777.04
yourself and

9773.84 --> 9780.479
projecting but I mean continue this put

9777.04 --> 9782.080000000002
more sentences there to continue the

9780.479 --> 9784.679999999998
process of

9782.08 --> 9788.12
projection and then I will keep pointing

9784.68 --> 9790.399
out for everybody to see how you are

9788.12 --> 9793.68
exactly doing that just like I'm saying

9790.399 --> 9793.68
that's fine keep doing

9797.2 --> 9803.84
it but most today days I feel do I do I

9800.92 --> 9806.84
feel unwell most

9803.84 --> 9806.84
days

9809.279 --> 9814.59
bro how would you

9811.47 --> 9814.59
[Music]

9814.72 --> 9821.278999999999
know do I feel unwell most days guys do

9818.279 --> 9821.279
I

9832.64 --> 9838.8
I honestly don't know I don't think so I

9835.72 --> 9840.479
just I have ups and downs

9838.8 --> 9843.679999999998
I'm

9840.479 --> 9846.8
I'm have mood swings it goes all over

9843.68 --> 9850.479000000001
the place I would definitely not say I

9846.8 --> 9850.479
feel unwell most

9854.0 --> 9860.24
days because I tell

9856.88 --> 9862.8
us well sometimes I have have

9860.24 --> 9865.84
uncomfortable things that I'm

9862.8 --> 9868.358999999999
experiencing something that's Brewing or

9865.84 --> 9871.52
whatever and then sometimes I restore

9868.359 --> 9874.04
from that and other times I don't I feel

9871.52 --> 9877.0
right now like I'm on an uptake so like

9874.04 --> 9880.800000000001
I'm in a positive phase where I'm very

9877.0 --> 9883.88
focused and very capable of explaining

9880.8 --> 9888.56
things on a high level quality which I

9883.88 --> 9888.56
have done the entire damn show

9891.84 --> 9899.279
I usually start the show telling us I

9894.72 --> 9899.278999999999
don't feel well no that's

9902.72 --> 9907.358999999999
nonsense that's just nonsense waterers

9908.359 --> 9915.279
boy I usually tell the show I start the

9912.399 --> 9918.56
show saying like oh I had a late night I

9915.279 --> 9922.319000000001
feel a bit wonky or like I might need

9918.56 --> 9924.278999999999
some time to wake up that's not the same

9922.319 --> 9928.119999999999
as I feel

9924.279 --> 9930.560000000001
unwell dude when I say I feel unwell

9928.12 --> 9933.640000000001
that's kind of rare because usually when

9930.56 --> 9936.96
I would be inclined to literally say I

9933.64 --> 9939.319
feel unwell at the started the show if

9936.96 --> 9941.919999999998
it was that bad I probably wouldn't have

9939.319 --> 9941.92
started the

9943.04 --> 9948.479000000001
show now I give pointers at the start of

9946.08 --> 9950.68
the show as to what my current condition

9948.479 --> 9952.8
is which might be like oh I have trouble

9950.68 --> 9956.319
waking up or I feel a bit wonky because

9952.8 --> 9958.56
I had a late night or something yeah not

9956.319 --> 9962.08
I feel

9958.56 --> 9965.319
unwell sometimes I say I'm feeling

9962.08 --> 9968.039999999999
trouble because of some things that I've

9965.319 --> 9971.88
read or like this terrible subject or I

9968.04 --> 9973.76
heard like this creepy satanic pedo talk

9971.88 --> 9977.479
and I can't get it out of my head it's

9973.76 --> 9979.56
[ __ ] me up right that might happen at

9977.479 --> 9983.16
at sometimes

9979.56 --> 9985.6
but I definitely don't start out most of

9983.16 --> 9989.319
my shows saying I'm

9985.6 --> 9989.319
unwell that's

9990.16 --> 9999.319
nonsense mood swings are in illness what

9994.479 --> 9999.319
no mood swings are a state of

10002.8 --> 10009.199999999999
being you could classify mood swings as

10006.16 --> 10012.52
a mental illness perhaps

10009.2 --> 10016.479000000001
or rather emotional Illness but I mean

10012.52 --> 10019.92
it's just this is like how I work I am

10016.479 --> 10025.399
sensitive and I

10019.92 --> 10029.8
have a wide variety of

10025.399 --> 10033.96
formats of my expression a wide variety

10029.8 --> 10037.199999999999
of states of being and and experience

10033.96 --> 10037.199999999999
and feelings

10040.52 --> 10046.6
in other words like emotionally

10043.6 --> 10050.6
emotionally socially I am all over the

10046.6 --> 10050.6
place it's true I

10052.88 --> 10057.72
am

10054.399 --> 10060.68
yeah in that sense I'm like the opposite

10057.72 --> 10060.679999999998
of naturally

10063.68 --> 10072.479000000001
stoic oh maybe oh yes Lucy oh thank you

10068.56 --> 10072.479
yes thanks for the advice

10073.2 --> 10076.2
Lucy

10077.12 --> 10082.76
yeah I I suggest you read your own

10080.16 --> 10084.84
advice because most of it going to be

10082.76 --> 10086.960000000001
projection I don't even need to read it

10084.84 --> 10091.72
for that

10086.96 --> 10091.72
fully I I know what you're doing right

10094.479 --> 10101.479

psychologist you don't have that

10101.479 --> 10107.278999999999
authority over me I'm not going to

10104.479 --> 10109.039999999999
accept that authority over me you're too

10107.279 --> 10113.04
preoccupied with

10109.04 --> 10115.319000000001
projection for me to see any value in

10113.04 --> 10116.12
this supposed helpful advice you're

10115.319 --> 10119.96
giving

10116.12 --> 10123.92
me thanks so just stick to yourself and

10119.96 --> 10125.08
I'll do what I do and I'll do it well as

10123.92 --> 10129.0
I

10125.08 --> 10131.439
do okay thanks I'll take care of myself

10129.0 --> 10134.0
I don't need you to tell me that for me

10131.439 --> 10137.359
to do that because I just do that anyway

10134.0 --> 10137.359
whether you're there to tell me or

10138.2 --> 10144.319000000001
not oh the way I see myself is not the

10141.399 --> 10146.8
way other people see me oh wow who could

10144.319 --> 10153.319
have foreseen

10146.8 --> 10153.319
that wow I'm learning so much today

10165.56 --> 10172.92
feels like you are

10167.72 --> 10176.199999999999
projecting oh yes oh wow yeah that's a

10172.92 --> 10180.52
really good no

10176.2 --> 10184.359
you brilliant I mean

10180.52 --> 10186.6
the level of deflection is just it's

10184.359 --> 10189.08
just so well hidden I mean it's not

10186.6 --> 10191.68
blatantly obvious that you're just doing

10189.08 --> 10191.68
know

10199.279 --> 10205.800000000001
youing Bo okay Lucy

10202.8 --> 10208.759999999998
level you need to stop right now or I'm

10205.8 --> 10208.759999999998
just going to kick you

10209.68 --> 10216.76
out you got it Lucy level drop the

10213.08 --> 10220.12
attitude and that means shut the [ __ ] up

10216.76 --> 10221.72
with your [ __ ] [ __ ] projection

10220.12 --> 10224.560000000001
and pitiful

10221.72 --> 10227.92
deflections or I kick you out because

10224.56 --> 10230.239
I'm sick of it I don't want to spend the

10227.92 --> 10233.64
next [ __ ] half hour like I've done

10230.239 --> 10237.039999999999
the previous half hour just pointing out

10233.64 --> 10239.84
to you what you're doing I don't need

10237.04 --> 10241.84
you to do that to me especially if

10239.84 --> 10246.16
you're going to just continually project

10241.84 --> 10249.239
your own situation onto me okay stop

10246.16 --> 10251.92
doing it or it's done

10249.239 --> 10256.96
I'm done with my

10251.92 --> 10259.68
patience for entertaining your childish

10256.96 --> 10262.239
behavior yeah you're not my medical

10259.68 --> 10266.16
doctor you're not my psychologist you're

10262.239 --> 10268.199999999999
not my wife you're not my family you can

10266.16 --> 10272.92
drop it

10268.2 --> 10272.92
now yes is that

10275.08 --> 10280.439
clear right I'll be right back in two

10277.439 --> 10280.439
minutes

10286.56 --> 10289.56
for

10327.319 --> 10330.319
sh

10348.04 --> 10350.800000000001
clear

10351.0 --> 10358.72
good now anybody watching still here

10355.319 --> 10358.72
don't forget to Rogan it

10361.88 --> 10368.8
up

10364.359 --> 10368.800000000001
huh what's this

10381.8 --> 10387.759999999998
KP sent

10384.64 --> 10390.72
me the invisible rainbow

10387.76 --> 10394.72
PDF the entire book

10390.72 --> 10394.72
apparently I might check that out

10394.92 --> 10400.439
later is raw meat bad to eat

10400.68 --> 10407.359
no but you do risk parasites more when

10404.72 --> 10412.0
you eat raw meat

10407.359 --> 10413.84
so I wouldn't just eat any old raw meat

10412.0 --> 10417.239
you have to be very careful with your

10413.84 --> 10421.12
sourcing for that otherwise you might

10417.239 --> 10424.92
contract some serious parasites

10421.12 --> 10427.92
too so yeah ra meat is actually really

10424.92 --> 10430.76
good but you got to be even more careful

10427.92 --> 10430.76
with the

10433.96 --> 10441.319
sourcing right because cooking the meat

10437.72 --> 10443.88
like it well it destroys any parasites

10441.319 --> 10443.88
most of the

10448.12 --> 10455.640000000001
time there's a debate between Wht and

10451.279 --> 10455.640000000001
Professor dve oh okay

10464.68 --> 10468.439
what what

10466.279 --> 10471.439
debate what the hell are they gonna

10468.439 --> 10474.76
debate about wi it and Professor oh wait

10471.439 --> 10477.479000000001
Professor Dave Oh I thought so flatter

10474.76 --> 10481.84
da Professor

10477.479 --> 10487.399
yeah yeah well talking to Professor Dave

10481.84 --> 10487.399
is always going to be a waste of time

10492.52 --> 10499.04
but I guess it'll bring some attention I

10495.479 --> 10501.599999999999
mean Professor Dave has all the

10499.04 --> 10503.640000000001
subscribers in the world all the anti

10501.6 --> 10507.56
flat earthers in the entire [ __ ]

10503.64 --> 10511.88
world are all like on to him he's like

10507.56 --> 10511.88
their champion of retardation and

10513.56 --> 10521.6
denial it's just going to be ad home

10516.479 --> 10521.599999999999
from home after at home yeah

10524.64 --> 10530.039999999999
probably he's not even a professor that

10527.399 --> 10530.039999999999
you're damn

10530.2 --> 10537.08
right but I mean he professes to be a

10534.08 --> 10537.08
professor

10566.56 --> 10573.6
you think wit it and jiren will turn

10569.399 --> 10573.599999999999
their backs on flatter what

10575.279 --> 10581.960000000001
why why the hell would they do that

10579.72 --> 10586.358999999999
like what's the point of

10581.96 --> 10586.358999999999
that what the hell is there to turn

10586.76 --> 10594.279
to I mean seriously what the

10589.8 --> 10598.358999999999
hell can you even turn to after that

10594.279 --> 10598.359
makes no sense Stephen Jarvis

10616.88 --> 10622.358999999999
money what money what the hell what

10627.08 --> 10633.479
money like who the hell would pay them

10631.04 --> 10635.160000000002
just to say oh Earth is a ball after all

10633.479 --> 10639.16
I mean they couldn't live with

10635.16 --> 10639.16
themselves after that point

10641.279 --> 10647.359
cuz everybody in the [ __ ] world would

10644.72 --> 10650.92
just know they're a

10647.359 --> 10653.2
liar except totally self- deluded

10650.92 --> 10654.16
demonic people that you would know are

10653.2 --> 10657.720000000001
totally

10654.16 --> 10660.279
deluded demonic people like you can't

10657.72 --> 10660.278999999999
live with

10661.439 --> 10667.479000000001
that that's why everybody that basically

10665.16 --> 10668.68
is a flat earther and then turns away

10667.479 --> 10673.479
from it

10668.68 --> 10678.0
they all disappear they all disappear

10673.479 --> 10681.76
all of it cuz it's not doable it's not

10678.0 --> 10681.76
durable for the long

10682.52 --> 10687.880000000001
run changing my name to Professor

10688.56 --> 10694.08
what

10690.08 --> 10694.08
koven what

10699.56 --> 10706.479
Kent Hoven wasn't no he's a

10703.04 --> 10710.720000000001
preacher Kent Hoven he's not

10706.479 --> 10715.72
nuts I mean Kent Hoven was great K Hoven

10710.72 --> 10718.92
was crucial for my Awakening to

10715.72 --> 10721.278999999999
Creation before Flat Earth I got into

10718.92 --> 10725.239
creationism before Flat

10721.279 --> 10729.239
Earth I got into that in

10725.239 --> 10729.239
like 2000

10729.68 --> 10732.68
6

10740.84 --> 10747.56
2005 no

10744.16 --> 10747.56
wait yeah

10751.0 --> 10758.6
2008 right and yeah Kent Hoven I

10755.12 --> 10760.52
mean he he could have put eventually

10758.6 --> 10762.76
become a bit of a flat earther but I'm

10760.52 --> 10764.720000000001
pretty damn sure he basically got

10762.76 --> 10766.439
grafted into the brother into the

10764.72 --> 10768.8
ballart

10766.439 --> 10772.52
Brotherhood and potentially was

10768.8 --> 10774.16
threatened like you must oppose Flat

10772.52 --> 10777.12
Earth at all

10774.16 --> 10780.6
cost that was probably the condition for

10777.12 --> 10780.6
him to be released from

10784.84 --> 10790.04
jail sounds crazy right but I mean

10792.8 --> 10798.479
I think that Kent Hoven is like in some

10795.2 --> 10801.239000000001
way directly blackmailed to oppos Flat

10798.479 --> 10801.239
Earth at all

10802.76 --> 10809.239
cost is the only person that's rolled

10806.0 --> 10812.12
out the most

10809.239 --> 10813.84
ridiculous speculations and claims like

10812.12 --> 10816.479000000001
for example about the nature of the

10813.84 --> 10821.239
Molen iron core he's the only person

10816.479 --> 10824.319
I've ever seen to do that

10821.239 --> 10828.239
ever you don't do

10824.319 --> 10830.56
that unless you like feel you have to at

10828.239 --> 10830.56
all

10831.12 --> 10836.960000000001
cost because no baller would do that at

10834.399 --> 10838.72
all costs they'd just like realize yeah

10836.96 --> 10841.96
we don't really know they'd be honest

10838.72 --> 10841.96
about it

10848.52 --> 10853.720000000001
mean the word universe itself doesn't it

10851.08 --> 10858.319
involve outer space as its definition no

10853.72 --> 10861.599999999999
it does not Universe just means one

10858.319 --> 10861.6
place the

10862.08 --> 10866.8
verse the United

10872.439 --> 10878.960000000001
Place yeah the realm is the universe

10882.52 --> 10888.52
the universe merely just indicates like

10885.2 --> 10888.52
all places that

10889.64 --> 10897.479
exist as one so Universe means like a a

10894.8 --> 10901.239
collection of places that aren't

10897.479 --> 10904.56
separated you like they're not you can

10901.239 --> 10907.319
get from every part of the universe to

10904.56 --> 10909.84
every other part of the universe somehow

10907.319 --> 10913.039999999999
if they were 100% separated you can

10909.84 --> 10916.16
never get from one place to the other

10913.04 --> 10918.319000000001
then those places would not together be

10916.16 --> 10918.319
the

10929.92 --> 10936.0
universe so if there other places like

10933.72 --> 10938.76
physical planets what the [ __ ] are you

10936.0 --> 10942.6
talking about duper

10938.76 --> 10945.239
no because other in the heliocentric

10942.6 --> 10946.880000000001
model there are other planets and you

10945.239 --> 10950.279
can get to

10946.88 --> 10952.56
them so that means that all this

10950.279 --> 10955.239
available space is the

10952.56 --> 10957.64
universe including the other planets

10955.239 --> 10957.64
that's in

10959.239 --> 10966.039999999999
heliocentrism yeah in the real world we

10962.52 --> 10968.399000000001
have a realm we have a contained space

10966.04 --> 10971.960000000001
and some of it may there may be more

10968.399 --> 10974.278999999999
space available there may be more realm

10971.96 --> 10976.96
segments that we don't know about but

10974.279 --> 10979.52
that are there all the Realms together

10976.96 --> 10982.759999999998
would be the universe now there might be

10979.52 --> 10985.12
some weird cut off parallel Dimension

10982.76 --> 10988.68
another physical place that's out Out Of

10985.12 --> 10989.960000000001
Reach somehow because like it's outside

10988.68 --> 10994.56
of the

10989.96 --> 10997.16
loop for example well those places would

10994.56 --> 11000.039999999999
then not be part of the universe because

10997.16 --> 11004.52
there is no way you can get

11000.04 --> 11007.640000000001
there from the known

11004.52 --> 11010.84
Realms if there's no physical way to get

11007.64 --> 11013.64
to the other place then it together does

11010.84 --> 11013.64
not form the

11016.52 --> 11021.16
universe hey blue build Evolution good

11018.88 --> 11021.16
to see

11024.399 --> 11030.68
you UFOs come from other plants what

11029.12 --> 11033.6
planets yeah

11030.68 --> 11037.56
yeah yeah but UFOs just come from the

11033.6 --> 11039.279
volcanoes they come from the inner

11037.56 --> 11044.199999999999
terrestrial

11039.279 --> 11048.239
space or From Another

11044.2 --> 11050.319000000001
Dimension that is parallel to this realm

11048.239 --> 11052.76
well if they can get from another

11050.319 --> 11055.399
dimension that is parallel to this one

11052.76 --> 11058.76
to this realm that means that their

11055.399 --> 11061.399
realm their Dimension and this realm are

11058.76 --> 11064.0
one because you can get from one to the

11061.399 --> 11066.84
other that makes it all the

11064.0 --> 11070.76
Universe I mean Universe in a

11066.84 --> 11074.76
way at least this is how I regard it

11070.76 --> 11074.76
is the available

11081.04 --> 11085.84
space the available space where you can

11085.96 --> 11092.438999999998
get right so let let's just imagine

11088.76 --> 11097.04
we're in a in a globe or in a in a snow

11092.439 --> 11099.64
globe on a flatter disc and like oh look

11097.04 --> 11103.6
I'm at the edge of the Dome I can see

11099.64 --> 11103.599999999999
another Dome out

11106.16 --> 11112.16
there I can see another realm over there

11109.88 --> 11114.599999999999
you see it's also a snow globe it's out

11112.16 --> 11116.68
there well guess what you can get there

11114.6 --> 11118.2
you can get out of the container you can

11116.68 --> 11120.92
get out of the realm

11118.2 --> 11123.2
you can get to that other place

11120.92 --> 11124.8
physically so that's not part of the

11123.2 --> 11127.560000000001
same

11124.8 --> 11130.08
universe you can never even confirm that

11127.56 --> 11133.08
that place is actually a place and not a

11130.08 --> 11134.72
figment or an illusion of some kind like

11133.08 --> 11138.479
the nonlocal holographic angular

11134.72 --> 11141.84
manifestations are technically Holograms

11138.479 --> 11145.0
you can't prove that those are physical

11141.84 --> 11146.84
places just because they seem to appear

11145.0 --> 11150.2
like that to you to your brain

11146.84 --> 11150.2
interpreting that them like

11155.8 --> 11161.479
that oh oh I missed a point oh thanks

11159.239 --> 11164.399
Lucy you're always there to tell me to

11161.479 --> 11167.08
point out oh I don't think Arwin got it

11164.399 --> 11171.16
I think you I think you don't understand

11167.08 --> 11174.2
oh thanks Lucy thanks you're always

11171.16 --> 11178.119999999999
there to point out how incompetent you

11174.2 --> 11183.04
think I am thanks a lot for that you're

11178.12 --> 11183.04
so bloody helpful all the time

11214.84 --> 11221.64
so yeah you think I missed his point

11218.04 --> 11224.04
about UFOs or really based on what based

11221.64 --> 11226.319
on why don't you actually lay it down

11224.04 --> 11229.800000000001
with your [ __ ] accusations lucil Lev

11226.319 --> 11229.8
I'm getting really sick of

11232.239 --> 11240.72
you what

11234.8 --> 11244.72
point do you claim a I missed about his

11240.72 --> 11247.72
point about UFOs now you write it down

11244.72 --> 11247.72
meticulously

11270.96 --> 11276.56
oh you oh other people are not saying

11273.52 --> 11278.479000000001
they're non-local Holograms oh other I'm

11276.56 --> 11279.84
the only flat earther that talks about

11278.479 --> 11283.96
that

11279.84 --> 11283.960000000001
oh so

11284.16 --> 11291.239
what so they don't think about it like

11287.64 --> 11294.319
that oh no I better stop talking about

11291.239 --> 11297.56
it because it's not and not everybody's

11294.319 --> 11300.76
just saying it I'm the only one saying

11297.56 --> 11304.76
their nonlocal Holograms so I must be

11300.76 --> 11308.84
wrong because not everybody's saying it

11304.76 --> 11311.880000000001
yes of course that's how that works

11308.84 --> 11314.64
right oh I'll stop saying it because not

11311.88 --> 11318.0
everybody's repeating me and then it

11314.64 --> 11320.8
must be wrong because the majority

11318.0 --> 11323.84
consensus is always a great indication

11320.8 --> 11326.08
whether something is real or not right

11323.84 --> 11328.04
it's not like people

11326.08 --> 11331.279
continually at this

11328.04 --> 11334.92
disposition to always pick what is most

11331.279 --> 11339.0
convenient and most incorrect In

11334.92 --> 11341.08
general yes of course no I'll just stop

11339.0 --> 11345.479
calling it a non-local hologram because

11341.08 --> 11348.8
I'm the only one saying that yes no how

11345.479 --> 11353.84
about no how about people just give some

11348.8 --> 11357.92
damn recognition to why I even call them

11353.84 --> 11362.76
that yeah why you prove you understand

11357.92 --> 11362.76
what the [ __ ] it even means when I say

11366.12 --> 11373.160000000002
that yeah people are

11369.56 --> 11375.519999999999
not repeating me because they don't

11373.16 --> 11378.8
agree they're not repeating me because

11375.52 --> 11382.640000000001
they don't [ __ ] understand it they

11378.8 --> 11386.0
don't they can't form it in their head

11382.64 --> 11388.96
they can't reconstruct what I'm talking

11386.0 --> 11391.479
about because it's complicated and it

11388.96 --> 11394.08
requires overcoming some internal

11391.479 --> 11397.679999999998
psychological obstacles that are very

11394.08 --> 11401.76
very tough to overcome arguably just as

11397.68 --> 11404.439
tough as switching from realizing the

11401.76 --> 11406.6
like to realizing the Earth is flat like

11404.439 --> 11408.56
it's almost that difficult yeah oh not

11406.6 --> 11412.16
everybody's repeating me oh it must be

11408.56 --> 11416.6
wrong no no it's just really freaking

11412.16 --> 11416.6
difficult that's what it is

11427.92 --> 11433.399
never said it was wrong oh really oh

11430.12 --> 11433.399000000001
you're just inferring

11438.84 --> 11443.8
it yeah you just said there is no

11441.479 --> 11446.479
evidence for that

11443.8 --> 11449.72
stuff how do other flat earthers feel

11446.479 --> 11452.16
about that yeah what is that how am I

11449.72 --> 11455.72
supposed to interpret you putting those

11452.16 --> 11460.52
sentences together well I didn't say you

11455.72 --> 11464.88
were wrong I just really really

11460.52 --> 11464.880000000001
insinuated it indirectly

11465.239 --> 11471.119999999999
Lucy yeah that's what you

11468.16 --> 11473.239
did yeah by putting the sentences

11471.12 --> 11477.08
together the way that you did it's it's

11473.239 --> 11479.88
like you're just you just want to do it

11477.08 --> 11481.84
with without doing it cuz you know I'm

11479.88 --> 11484.96
going to correct you but you want to

11481.84 --> 11487.359
just be able to say it in a way that

11484.96 --> 11489.599999999999
when I say hey you're insinuating this

11487.359 --> 11492.800000000001
you're saying this you say I didn't do

11489.6 --> 11495.359
that you're wrongly accusing me I just

11492.8 --> 11498.56
put two sentences together that are

11495.359 --> 11500.479000000001
extremely suggestive that's all I didn't

11498.56 --> 11504.119999999999
say

11500.479 --> 11509.239
it [ __ ] annoying

11504.12 --> 11509.239000000001
woman this is getting really seriously

11514.64 --> 11519.64
tedious read what I just said well how

11517.239 --> 11523.199999999999
about I just don't how about I'm just

11519.64 --> 11523.199999999999
done reading what you're

11523.359 --> 11528.880000000001
saying Luc see if I catch you talking

11526.479 --> 11530.96
like this again on the next show I'm G

11528.88 --> 11535.438999999998
to kick you

11530.96 --> 11535.438999999998
up it's been extremely

11535.479 --> 11542.08
tedious you keep doing this you've been

11538.479 --> 11544.92
doing it the entire [ __ ] show it's

11542.08 --> 11544.92
extremely

11562.68 --> 11568.56
tedious does the Sun cause the seasons

11573.16 --> 11582.399
well technically no but I mean the solar

11578.68 --> 11583.479000000001
output the actual light that accompanies

11582.399 --> 11586.92
the

11583.479 --> 11590.72
sun does seem to be the main influencing

11586.92 --> 11590.72
factors to the seasons

11594.56 --> 11600.359
yeah but I mean the sun itself is not an

11598.16 --> 11601.399
object it's not the cause of anything

11600.359 --> 11604.56
it's an

11601.399 --> 11606.84
effect it's like a hologram that is the

11604.56 --> 11609.08
thing that you see as a side effect to

11606.84 --> 11611.84
the non-local

11609.08 --> 11613.52
angular light

11611.84 --> 11616.8
manifestation it's the light

11613.52 --> 11620.16
manifestation that actually causes the

11616.8 --> 11622.119999999999
seasons not the apparent disc you get to

11620.16 --> 11625.119999999999
see at the

11622.12 --> 11628.640000000001
epicenter of the angle from which that

11625.12 --> 11628.640000000001
light comes

11628.96 --> 11634.679999999998
because that appearance that supposed

11632.08 --> 11637.0
disc that you see that we know as the

11634.68 --> 11639.800000000001
sun doesn't actually do anything it's

11637.0 --> 11639.8
just a side

11646.28 --> 11649.319000000001
[Music]

11649.6 --> 11654.52
effect what the north we are near the

11653.279 --> 11658.52
sun in the

11654.52 --> 11658.52
winter what

11658.96 --> 11663.08
no there is no distance to the Sun

11660.76 --> 11665.68
there's no nearer or

11663.08 --> 11668.6
closer or further

11665.68 --> 11672.279
away there's no actual position of any

11668.6 --> 11672.279
of it there only

11672.68 --> 11679.92
angular angular

11675.239 --> 11679.92
data and intensity

11687.76 --> 11693.800000000001
no Lucy you're just [ __ ]

11691.359 --> 11697.12
tedious and I'm I'm getting done with

11693.8 --> 11699.358999999999
you you're not just asking

11697.12 --> 11702.52
questions way you're formulating it

11699.359 --> 11706.56
you're trying to entrap me you've been

11702.52 --> 11709.0
doing it for like an hour yeah and I'm

11706.56 --> 11709.0
sick of

11714.64 --> 11721.039999999999
it it's over there I me just saying that

11717.399 --> 11721.039999999999
yeah well I'm not in a joking mood

11730.439 --> 11735.279
today be honest would you prefer I

11733.0 --> 11737.199
wouldn't come back yeah at this point I

11735.279 --> 11739.0
kind of do if this is going to be the

11737.199 --> 11741.560000000001
way you're going to be behaving in my

11739.0 --> 11744.72
chat then yes yeah by all means don't

11741.56 --> 11747.76
come back CU all you're doing is just

11744.72 --> 11750.76
undermining everything that I say

11747.76 --> 11754.12
you're getting increasingly more passive

11750.76 --> 11756.76
aggressive about it and I'm it's really

11754.12 --> 11756.76
getting on my

11756.96 --> 11764.358999999999
nerves I've advised you to stop it yet

11760.439 --> 11764.359
you continue doing

11773.92 --> 11778.92
it fair enough yeah bye

11798.64 --> 11805.68
yeah you can come back when you don't

11802.04 --> 11807.52
feel compulsive to continually undermine

11805.68 --> 11812.399
every damn thing I say

11807.52 --> 11812.399000000001
yeah that's when you can come back

11844.52 --> 11851.359
yeah so let me address again your

11849.04 --> 11853.76
incessant undermining of every damn

11851.359 --> 11855.16
thing that I've ever brought forth which

11853.76 --> 11859.16
is [ __ ]

11855.16 --> 11860.88
tedious yeah nonlocal hologram stuff

11859.16 --> 11862.56
there's no evidence for it yeah well

11860.88 --> 11864.16
there is no evidence for a physical

11862.56 --> 11866.239
nature other than you just having

11864.16 --> 11868.239
physicality assumption wise and assuming

11866.239 --> 11871.84
it because when it comes to the

11868.239 --> 11874.8
celestials there is no data but angular

11871.84 --> 11876.479
data and angular data is not sufficient

11874.8 --> 11880.479
to prove a

11876.479 --> 11880.479
location or a physical

11881.0 --> 11886.84
nature yeah and again that's where I

11884.359 --> 11890.279
rest my

11886.84 --> 11893.08
case like you unless you like have any

11890.279 --> 11895.640000000001
evidence that would contradict that the

11893.08 --> 11898.76
the only data there is of the celestials

11895.64 --> 11898.76
is angular

11904.88 --> 11909.119999999999
yeah any evidence of

11909.279 --> 11915.52
proximity angular size increase yeah

11913.6 --> 11917.52
love to hear about it right that that's

11915.52 --> 11920.279
immediately my non-local angular

11917.52 --> 11925.52
manifestation Theory that's that's the

11920.279 --> 11928.239
end of that so where is it yeah I me you

11925.52 --> 11932.239
can just say I don't think you have any

11928.239 --> 11935.0
evidence for that I'm so smart so smart

11932.239 --> 11937.88
pointing that out I mean you can't just

11935.0 --> 11940.16
disprove it or you could just say oh

11937.88 --> 11942.16
there's no evidence for it I feel so

11940.16 --> 11945.72
smart for pointing out you don't have

11942.16 --> 11949.08
any evidence for what you're saying even

11945.72 --> 11953.438999999998
though you could theoretically disprove

11949.08 --> 11956.84
it by bringing forth data that proves it

11953.439 --> 11959.319
wrong but no you can always rest on oh

11956.84 --> 11963.84
you don't have any evidence Arwin for

11959.319 --> 11966.68
your hologram Theory oh well pet on the

11963.84 --> 11969.279
hat for you you're so [ __ ] smart but

11966.68 --> 11971.56
you didn't have any evidence against it

11969.279 --> 11974.04
though yeah you didn't prove it was

11971.56 --> 11975.56
physical

11974.04 --> 11978.560000000001
though

11975.56 --> 11980.319
right but you can be a smartass and say

11978.56 --> 11982.479
oh you don't have any evidence that it's

11980.319 --> 11982.479
a

11983.0 --> 11987.76
hologram yeah those are the kind of

11985.439 --> 11991.12
statements that make me want to tell you

11987.76 --> 11991.12
to [ __ ] off

11999.279 --> 12005.560000000001
then no I'm not doing something for

12002.12 --> 12005.560000000001
Father's Day

12020.92 --> 12027.92
good bye Lucy level [ __ ] off then

12025.319 --> 12029.76
[ __ ] I'm going to hold it I'm going to

12027.92 --> 12032.56
hold you to that if I see you again

12029.76 --> 12034.56
you're banned I'm not going to ban you

12032.56 --> 12036.88
now because I want to leave your shitty

12034.56 --> 12039.96
ass text right there for everybody to

12036.88 --> 12042.679999999998
see so that everybody can take note of

12039.96 --> 12046.679999999998
how I'm correct about every damn thing I

12042.68 --> 12049.239
said about you yeah but yeah you're not

12046.68 --> 12049.239
not welcome

12066.479 --> 12072.84
anymore don't you think they have

12068.479 --> 12075.198999999999
bounced radar off these objects no no

12072.84 --> 12078.08
they have

12075.199 --> 12080.92
not absolutely absolutely

12078.08 --> 12083.399
not there's no objects to bounce

12080.92 --> 12083.399
anything

12083.84 --> 12087.84
off especially with

12091.359 --> 12096.52
radar I mean oh we bounced the signal

12094.199 --> 12099.6
off the moon yeah except you didn't

12096.52 --> 12101.319000000001
actually do that you just send a signal

12099.6 --> 12103.960000000001
somewhere up there whether there's a

12101.319 --> 12106.92
moon out or not and then oh something I

12103.96 --> 12108.88
we got something back that means There's

12106.92 --> 12112.16
a Moon there oh really how did you know

12108.88 --> 12114.64
you actually pointed at it could it not

12112.16 --> 12117.119999999999
just be bouncing off the Dome did you

12114.64 --> 12119.88
very manipulate the direction of the

12117.12 --> 12121.76
signal to the Moon to show that oh when

12119.88 --> 12123.56
I pointed at the moon the signal comes

12121.76 --> 12127.16
back when I don't pointed at the Moon it

12123.56 --> 12129.92
doesn't come back oh no you didn't oh

12127.16 --> 12132.039999999999
okay well then you didn't provide proof

12129.92 --> 12135.6
that you actually bounce the signal of

12132.04 --> 12135.6
the Moon then

12165.52 --> 12169.640000000001
then the Dome would be

12167.84 --> 12172.92
250

12169.64 --> 12174.84
240,000 miles then okay well maybe it is

12172.92 --> 12178.08
Steven Jarvis

12174.84 --> 12178.08
sure why

12184.92 --> 12189.479
not hey F roads

12215.16 --> 12218.16
a

12235.0 --> 12241.72
so it can be a semicircle above us what

12239.08 --> 12241.72
does that even

12242.76 --> 12245.76
mean

12255.359 --> 12259.359
what e

12287.399 --> 12294.439
the radius of Flat Earth would be that I

12290.88 --> 12294.438999999998
don't know what the hell that even

12315.319 --> 12320.439
means so yeah St I don't know what the

12318.16 --> 12322.8
hell you're talking about what are you

12320.439 --> 12322.800000000001
talking

12339.52 --> 12346.640000000001
about oh I agreed with the distance to

12343.6 --> 12350.239
an object did I did I no you just said

12346.64 --> 12351.358999999999
it and I said like oh okay sure whatever

12350.239 --> 12355.88
that's what I

12351.359 --> 12355.880000000001
said what the hell does that even

12358.88 --> 12367.56
mean so your conclusion that distance uh

12364.96 --> 12367.56
what does that

12368.52 --> 12376.479000000001
mean that could be the Dome yeah sure it

12371.96 --> 12376.479
could be it might be who knows

12377.359 --> 12382.439
I mean was it very manipulated when you

12380.199 --> 12385.880000000001
did that did you go in all directions

12382.439 --> 12387.880000000001
and like hey how much distance is it now

12385.88 --> 12389.56
how much distance is it now how much

12387.88 --> 12393.278999999999
distance is it now how much distance is

12389.56 --> 12395.68
it now how much now how much now is that

12393.279 --> 12397.68
included I don't think it's

12395.68 --> 12400.68
included yeah I don't think it's

12397.68 --> 12400.68
included

12404.24 --> 12407.378999999999
[Music]

12440.0 --> 12447.84
damn is it 3 hours and 24 minutes

12442.56 --> 12447.84
already Jesus it's been very

12448.0 --> 12452.359
long

12450.199 --> 12456.479000000001
right at least I'm not going to have to

12452.359 --> 12462.04
deal with Lucy level after this anymore

12456.479 --> 12464.64
sheesh somebody just really was annoying

12462.04 --> 12466.92
today that means that they're going to

12464.64 --> 12469.119999999999
piss off now that I'm perfectly fine

12466.92 --> 12469.12
with

12490.399 --> 12495.479
that

12492.0 --> 12497.399
right so yeah Lucy you could just ignore

12495.479 --> 12500.278999999999
everything that I've ever said and just

12497.399 --> 12503.239
disbelieve it I don't give a [ __ ] you

12500.279 --> 12505.479000000001
just sink back in your suspense of

12503.239 --> 12507.88
disbelief however you want to see

12505.479 --> 12510.0
reality and just go with the mainstream

12507.88 --> 12511.759999999998
and everything you want and just forget

12510.0 --> 12515.88
all about me because that's probably

12511.76 --> 12518.960000000001
what you will do well guess what not my

12515.88 --> 12523.0
problem yeah you want to do that you

12518.96 --> 12526.16
want to not handle what I have to

12523.0 --> 12528.0
offer without just projecting everything

12526.16 --> 12531.08
on to

12528.0 --> 12535.08
me yeah well then [ __ ] off then and go

12531.08 --> 12535.08
live your own life I don't give a

12538.96 --> 12545.599999999999
[ __ ] cuz I don't need you to believe me

12543.439 --> 12549.279
or accept what I

12545.6 --> 12551.399000000001
say yeah I'm just giving you an offer if

12549.279 --> 12554.6
you want to reject everything for

12551.399 --> 12558.039999999999
whatever damn reason like that's not my

12554.6 --> 12558.04
problem it's your problem

12580.6 --> 12583.6
right

12587.239 --> 12592.64
yeah so I'm going to round out the show

12589.72 --> 12593.56
now it's been a very interesting show

12592.64 --> 12596.399
very

12593.56 --> 12599.88
elaborate but yeah the bickering part

12596.399 --> 12601.8
was annoying though and if I'm correct

12599.88 --> 12603.119999999999
it's going to be the last time that

12601.8 --> 12605.319
that's going to happen with this

12603.12 --> 12607.479000000001
particular individual because they

12605.319 --> 12611.6
decided to [ __ ] off

12607.479 --> 12614.358999999999
now I'm kind of glad of that cuz usually

12611.6 --> 12617.6
when people attain that sort of attitude

12614.359 --> 12619.68
they never stop doing that that they

12617.6 --> 12622.640000000001
never stop doing

12619.68 --> 12624.6
that and that's very [ __ ] tedious

12622.64 --> 12628.96
especially because when they never stop

12624.6 --> 12630.960000000001
doing that they also permanently refuse

12628.96 --> 12633.64
to accept that that's actually what's

12630.96 --> 12637.96
happening they go into an inward denial

12633.64 --> 12641.119999999999
spiral and that never ends until they

12637.96 --> 12644.119999999999
leave so leaving is probably for the

12641.12 --> 12644.12
best

12650.239 --> 12656.08
right and for everybody else well it's

12653.72 --> 12659.84
up to

12656.08 --> 12662.88
you you can always ask a question as

12659.84 --> 12667.8
long as you not just preoccupied with

12662.88 --> 12671.479
how you're going to degrade my response

12667.8 --> 12674.239
or just preoccupy yourself with trying

12671.479 --> 12677.76
to point out flaws or things that I've

12674.239 --> 12682.479
said that you could take take as a call

12677.76 --> 12684.880000000001
sign to demote the worth of the value of

12682.479 --> 12689.358999999999
what I have to share yeah if that is

12684.88 --> 12689.358999999999
your priority well then just [ __ ]

12690.0 --> 12694.88
off like why the hell would I want to

12692.239 --> 12697.359
deal with that at

12694.88 --> 12700.479
all yeah you want to try to figure out

12697.359 --> 12703.960000000001
what I have to share then just ask if

12700.479 --> 12707.679999999998
you're just interested in how can

12703.96 --> 12709.839999999998
I pick up on whatever he's saying that I

12707.68 --> 12712.399
think might be slightly incorrect In

12709.84 --> 12713.880000000001
order to demote the entire value of

12712.399 --> 12717.96
everything that I have to say well then

12713.88 --> 12717.96
just [ __ ] off Lucy

12721.52 --> 12728.279
level yeah I don't give a [ __ ] whether

12724.8 --> 12732.759999999998
she agrees or disagrees it's the focus

12728.279 --> 12732.76
it's what she's doing with it

12733.439 --> 12739.359
okay and yeah she is probably a sock

12736.68 --> 12739.359
account I

12743.319 --> 12750.8
know doesn't

12746.52 --> 12750.800000000001
matter like it literally doesn't

12751.399 --> 12757.56
matter like I'm done with the stupid ass

12754.16 --> 12760.96
act I'm done with that

12757.56 --> 12762.8
position that demeanor that attitude I'm

12760.96 --> 12766.319
done with

12762.8 --> 12769.64
it she's teret I hope not that that's

12766.319 --> 12772.56
that's [ __ ] gross I doubt

12769.64 --> 12778.16
it I don't think that's

12772.56 --> 12778.16
teret ter would not have that kind of

12779.96 --> 12784.56
patience all right anyhow thanks
