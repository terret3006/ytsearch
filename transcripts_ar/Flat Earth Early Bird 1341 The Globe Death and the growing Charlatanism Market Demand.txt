114.24 --> 118.079
probably going to be a short show today

118.24 --> 123.03999999999999
well the weather is kind of the same as

120.799 --> 125.43900000000001
it was yesterday it's like partially

123.04 --> 127.759
clouded but clear blue sky in between

125.439 --> 132.07999999999998
sun is out

127.759 --> 134.4
very little wind so far though so it is

132.08 --> 136.8
still kind of hot although it is

134.4 --> 139.44
palpably less warm than it was like a

136.8 --> 139.44
month ago

141.12 --> 146.16
a month ago i would have been currently

143.28 --> 149.52
complaining about that lack of wind

146.16 --> 151.2
and probably not having a t-shirt on

149.52 --> 152.16
but uh

151.2 --> 156.11999999999998
yeah

152.16 --> 156.12
it's it's very doable

166.08 --> 169.84
hello mike sedunich first in chat

168.8 --> 172.56
pj

169.84 --> 172.56
good to see you

176.879 --> 185.44
right it is monday the 22nd of august

180.64 --> 187.67999999999998
2022. that's a lot of twos

185.44 --> 187.68
uh

190.879 --> 194.35999999999999
five of them

198.64 --> 203.27999999999997
right so how are you all doing

202.08 --> 206.64000000000001
i'm a little

203.28 --> 210.879
in a bit of a agitated mood today

206.64 --> 213.83999999999997
got myself yelling at my computer again

210.879 --> 216.07999999999998
uh

213.84 --> 217.68
but yeah i am

216.08 --> 220.72
like the uh

217.68 --> 223.68
the billy ache situation seems to be

220.72 --> 223.68
dying down again

225.04 --> 230.64
barely ate yesterday that was weird i

227.92 --> 232.95899999999997
basically didn't have any real lunch or

230.64 --> 232.95899999999997
dinner

234.159 --> 238.959
so i guess i sort of fasted like half

236.159 --> 243.67999999999998
the day and i needed it i mean

238.959 --> 245.599
my belly is very happy about that

243.68 --> 246.72
so yeah

245.599 --> 248.959
i just

246.72 --> 251.92
needed to fast i guess

248.959 --> 251.92000000000002
that that worked

252.64 --> 256.31899999999996
even if just for half a day

259.04 --> 263.04
right

260.479 --> 266.56
so yeah yesterday was

263.04 --> 266.56
relatively uneventful

266.84 --> 272.0
but a weird situation

273.28 --> 276.479
over at

275.199 --> 278.16
roxanne

276.479 --> 280.479
globalist denier

278.16 --> 283.12
really roxanne

280.479 --> 285.44
just popping by there and watching and

283.12 --> 290.0
this guy got on there i still haven't

285.44 --> 292.08
gotten any feedback i was asking adam to

290.0 --> 293.84
see if he can figure out some details

292.08 --> 296.88
about this but he hasn't gotten back to

293.84 --> 300.08
me yet

296.88 --> 303.52
but they just had some weirdo

300.08 --> 306.639
alchemist guy that looked oh so freaking

303.52 --> 311.19899999999996
trustworthy and oh he was so smart

306.639 --> 312.639
sounding i mean i would totally take

311.199 --> 315.759
a drink

312.639 --> 318.40000000000003
that from that guy that says oh yeah man

315.759 --> 321.36
colloidals gold that i make makes you

318.4 --> 324.23999999999995
smarter and then he he can barely

321.36 --> 326.56
coherently speak english and never takes

324.24 --> 328.72
his glasses off

326.56 --> 332.4
indoors

328.72 --> 335.28000000000003
yes oh that's such a smart smart

332.4 --> 335.28
association

335.68 --> 339.039
i was

337.12 --> 340.639
quite annoyed by that

339.039 --> 343.36
and

340.639 --> 345.6
yeah i let i let loose in the chat in

343.36 --> 347.68
the sense that i was just doing what i

345.6 --> 350.8
do it's kind of similar to what rasta

347.68 --> 352.479
had can do sometimes except

350.8 --> 355.52000000000004
i don't like

352.479 --> 357.039
go gross or anything like he would do

355.52 --> 359.919
this

357.039 --> 361.84
but i did just call it out like dude

359.919 --> 365.79999999999995
why the hell is this guy on what the

361.84 --> 365.79999999999995
hell is this [ __ ] about

366.0 --> 369.84
like oh oh oh he makes

368.479 --> 372.24
colloidal

369.84 --> 373.75899999999996
metals into

372.24 --> 375.44
transparent

373.759 --> 378.47900000000004
goo

375.44 --> 380.71999999999997
that can then form crystals

378.479 --> 383.75899999999996
and like yeah that's oh that's colloidal

380.72 --> 385.28000000000003
metal yes that's transparent goo of

383.759 --> 386.24
course it is

385.28 --> 389.28
i mean

386.24 --> 391.68
that's not like pollution at all i mean

389.28 --> 393.67999999999995
i made colloidal silver in the past and

391.68 --> 395.6
in the instructions of this simple

393.68 --> 398.319
system they said yeah make sure the

395.6 --> 399.84000000000003
water is completely unpolluted

398.319 --> 401.91900000000004
if it isn't

399.84 --> 402.96
weird [ __ ] can happen and you can get

401.919 --> 406.15999999999997
like

402.96 --> 407.919
not the right result

406.16 --> 411.199
and apparently this guy thought he was a

407.919 --> 414.79999999999995
freaking genius for making

411.199 --> 417.52000000000004
transparent goo out of colloidal metal

414.8 --> 419.68
and then saying that it's better

417.52 --> 422.31899999999996
and then blah blah blah some weird

419.68 --> 425.68
half-assed alchemy talk that made

422.319 --> 427.28000000000003
absolutely no sense and the guys

425.68 --> 429.599
richie

427.28 --> 431.84
richie you're freaking genius oh you're

429.599 --> 434.8
so smart

431.84 --> 436.4
he he said like arwen why are you being

434.8 --> 439.039
so negative

436.4 --> 441.44
yeah arwyn why are you being so negative

439.039 --> 443.36
i'm only trying to warn

441.44 --> 446.24
fellow flat earthers

443.36 --> 448.56
of some weirdo idiot you got on your

446.24 --> 451.36
show because you didn't actually really

448.56 --> 453.919
look into it you just

451.36 --> 457.039
took their word for it

453.919 --> 458.96
for some guy that is supposedly selling

457.039 --> 464.0
what he claims to be

458.96 --> 466.23999999999995
like yeah products for ingestion

464.0 --> 468.639
and you're just gonna get him on like i

466.24 --> 472.319
mean what if somebody actually watches

468.639 --> 472.319
that and thinks it's a good idea

472.639 --> 476.56
you don't know what the hell you're

474.0 --> 478.639
doing you're letting some freaky idiot

476.56 --> 483.199
wizard on

478.639 --> 485.28000000000003
who looks extremely dubious extremely

483.199 --> 487.12
dubious

485.28 --> 489.039
dodgy that's right

487.12 --> 491.039
it was just embarrassing

489.039 --> 492.4
that they timed me out because they

491.039 --> 497.52
wouldn't stop

492.4 --> 499.52
being no why did you stop being so mean

497.52 --> 501.19899999999996
so i just got out of there i mean this

499.52 --> 502.71999999999997
is not the first time they've done it i

501.199 --> 506.24
mean

502.72 --> 509.12
after three years you'd expect them to

506.24 --> 512.24
[ __ ] start paying attention and stop

509.12 --> 514.0
dragging in charlatans

512.24 --> 516.0
you idiot

514.0 --> 519.12
i mean if you're gonna get some weirdo

516.0 --> 521.039
electronic charlatan we might not even

519.12 --> 522.88
be a charlotte and he's like oh i'm

521.039 --> 526.16
building a perpetual mongolia or

522.88 --> 528.32
something yeah it's probably wrong right

526.16 --> 531.6
but at least he's not trying to sell

528.32 --> 533.519
products for ingestion you

531.6 --> 535.9200000000001
idiots

533.519 --> 540.399
you idiots

535.92 --> 540.399
i'm ashamed to associate with you

540.56 --> 544.0
for you doing that

542.88 --> 546.64
i mean

544.0 --> 549.04
how is this even [ __ ] different

546.64 --> 552.24
from some c

549.04 --> 554.959
vaccine salesman i mean it isn't

552.24 --> 557.44
it's oh just do it

554.959 --> 559.1199999999999
oh man sounds so trustworthy

557.44 --> 561.6800000000001
you're an idiot

559.12 --> 563.519
who that like

561.68 --> 565.519
just go away

563.519 --> 566.88
don't do that you're an idiot if you do

565.519 --> 569.279
that

566.88 --> 571.24
why would you drag anybody in there

569.279 --> 573.4399999999999
who's claiming they've got some

571.24 --> 576.08
revolutionary goo

573.44 --> 578.08
from colloidal metal

576.08 --> 581.2
that makes absolutely no sense because

578.08 --> 584.8000000000001
there's no metal in any form that would

581.2 --> 587.44
ever yield a transparent goo

584.8 --> 589.68
like that has to be assault which means

587.44 --> 592.5600000000001
pollutant

589.68 --> 596.0
yeah because metals don't form

592.56 --> 599.1999999999999
transparent goo under any

596.0 --> 601.68
any circumstances i'm not even a chemist

599.2 --> 603.9200000000001
and i know this because

601.68 --> 606.8
it's partial chemist because of my

603.92 --> 608.8
goldsmithing so this is just ridiculous

606.8 --> 610.959
and embarrassing

608.8 --> 613.12
and yeah i'm passionate i'm forward i

610.959 --> 616.2399999999999
was trying to protect them and they

613.12 --> 616.24
timed me out for it

616.8 --> 622.56
and i'm like [ __ ] you i'm unsubscribing

623.92 --> 627.279
you're irresponsible for doing that

625.92 --> 629.36
completely

627.279 --> 631.12
i mean what if somebody that you

629.36 --> 633.92
actually like

631.12 --> 636.72
thinks it's a good idea and then orders

633.92 --> 638.959
this stupid goo from the guy takes it

636.72 --> 641.6800000000001
and then has to be hospitalized because

638.959 --> 646.8
they got poison

641.68 --> 648.079
this is ridiculously idiotic to do that

646.8 --> 651.04
idiotic

648.079 --> 651.04
irresponsible

655.519 --> 659.2
so i was just really pissed off over

657.68 --> 661.4399999999999
that

659.2 --> 663.76
i mean i'm trying to be strict and

661.44 --> 665.839
uphold standards here for everybody and

663.76 --> 668.16
then they do that [ __ ]

665.839 --> 670.5600000000001
like some dumbass hippie dippy club i

668.16 --> 673.1999999999999
mean sure that's cool man

670.56 --> 676.0
get invite him on your floor and yeah

673.2 --> 676.0
just talk and

678.24 --> 682.0790000000001
how could you just have somebody on that

681.279 --> 683.68
just

682.079 --> 684.7199999999999
basically

683.68 --> 685.519
makes

684.72 --> 687.839
goo

685.519 --> 690.399
for ingestion with all kinds of claims

687.839 --> 693.36
that you obviously have no understanding

690.399 --> 695.519
of what so [ __ ] ever

693.36 --> 698.32
and then because they got videos about

695.519 --> 701.12
fractal patterns and cymatics oh that

698.32 --> 704.0
means they know what they're doing yes

701.12 --> 706.5600000000001
of course no

704.0 --> 706.56
idiots

711.2 --> 714.9590000000001
right

712.639 --> 717.12
and then it was like oh yeah dude

714.959 --> 719.76
you don't know anything about this don't

717.12 --> 720.8
criticize it until you know it just

719.76 --> 723.2
google

720.8 --> 725.4399999999999
what is it again

723.2 --> 725.44
uh

726.639 --> 731.04
apec

728.0 --> 734.16
i mean oh yeah google apex oh yes i'm

731.04 --> 736.959
sure that's gonna yield exactly what

734.16 --> 738.079
this guy's talking about no apec is like

736.959 --> 740.6389999999999
a

738.079 --> 742.2399999999999
world contract thing if you're gonna

740.639 --> 744.48
google that you're gonna have to scroll

742.24 --> 746.48
down like a thousand pages before you

744.48 --> 748.32
can find anything else it's just

746.48 --> 750.639
ridiculous

748.32 --> 752.1600000000001
so i asked adam meekin who is actually a

750.639 --> 754.32
chemist

752.16 --> 755.6
pharmacist and chemist

754.32 --> 757.36
like hey

755.6 --> 759.2
do you know what the hell this guy is

757.36 --> 762.48
talking about with all my knowledge it

759.2 --> 764.48
seems absolutely insane

762.48 --> 766.16
and i don't trust this at all but he

764.48 --> 768.5600000000001
hasn't gotten back to me it was very

766.16 --> 770.399
busy this weekend so i hope to hear back

768.56 --> 773.1199999999999
from him

770.399 --> 775.68
i was just pissed off and hurt i mean

773.12 --> 775.68
that hurt

775.92 --> 780.399
because

777.6 --> 782.9590000000001
i kind of do like those guys

780.399 --> 785.279
i think richie is a sympathetic guy and

782.959 --> 787.68
roxanne is awesome and they got some

785.279 --> 790.88
other guys on there

787.68 --> 793.519
lady and a guy and they are cool guys

790.88 --> 796.72
but they're dumb ass hippies

793.519 --> 798.8
you're like oh this guy he's so mean

796.72 --> 800.8000000000001
you're being so mean yeah why do you

798.8 --> 803.5999999999999
[ __ ] think i'm being mean you got a

800.8 --> 805.3599999999999
guy on that's literally

803.6 --> 808.16
trying to promote

805.36 --> 809.839
goo he makes in his in his freaking

808.16 --> 812.88
garage

809.839 --> 815.6
for ingestion claiming it will make you

812.88 --> 818.24
smart and healthy like what the [ __ ] are

815.6 --> 818.24
you thinking

827.44 --> 830.5600000000001
i mean

828.639 --> 834.0790000000001
why would you even get somebody like

830.56 --> 838.4799999999999
that on unless you had a confirmed

834.079 --> 841.279
vouched for chemist among you

838.48 --> 843.76
if you don't know anything about it why

841.279 --> 845.76
would you just invite them on you don't

843.76 --> 846.88
even know if what he's talking about is

845.76 --> 849.68
real

846.88 --> 853.04
why the hell would you do that

849.68 --> 855.279
it's ridiculous i'm sorry i'm just

853.04 --> 857.36
i was really pissed off over that but

855.279 --> 859.279
then elise g

857.36 --> 861.839
and me had a good conversation over

859.279 --> 865.279
skype and that really made it all right

861.839 --> 869.24
apparently at least g is on a real

865.279 --> 869.24
upwards streak

870.56 --> 877.199
and yeah that was great hello by the way

872.88 --> 880.48
elise g and dan winfield w

877.199 --> 880.4799999999999
rufus sent hobbins

880.639 --> 885.6

884.32 --> 887.0400000000001
i don't know

885.6 --> 889.6800000000001
are you

887.04 --> 892.68
like on holly synergetics again rufus

889.68 --> 892.68
inhabits

908.079 --> 913.76
right pgc net exactly

910.639 --> 916.72
it's it's bad all way around the guy

913.76 --> 918.56
seemed like of some disgusting

916.72 --> 919.839
to be fair he seemed like a satanist

918.56 --> 922.0
that was just

919.839 --> 924.0
putting up an act to [ __ ] with people

922.0 --> 926.399
because of fun of it

924.0 --> 928.32
and he was deep undercover i mean i

926.399 --> 930.079
literally just criticized him straight

928.32 --> 930.88
out in chat like hey take your glasses

930.079 --> 934.2399999999999
off

930.88 --> 936.48
you sound like like a barely coherent

934.24 --> 938.639
confused hippie

936.48 --> 942.72
why the hell would i take a product from

938.639 --> 944.88
a barely coherent sounding hippie

942.72 --> 946.639
that claims you're it makes you smart

944.88 --> 947.92
like what the [ __ ] is wrong with this

946.639 --> 951.199
situation

947.92 --> 952.959
and he was like staring with like a

951.199 --> 956.639
modest smile

952.959 --> 957.92
like with his [ __ ] glasses on okay so

956.639 --> 959.839
he knew

957.92 --> 962.88
he was a scammer

959.839 --> 965.44
he was [ __ ] with them it was [ __ ]

962.88 --> 967.279
with people that i've met face to face

965.44 --> 970.5600000000001
that despite being a little [ __ ]

967.279 --> 973.199
sometimes i consider my friends

970.56 --> 976.079
and he's a scammer that guy is a [ __ ]

973.199 --> 981.399
disgusting scammer everything about him

976.079 --> 981.399
just oozes evil and lies

987.12 --> 995.9590000000001
so yeah take a look at it

990.16 --> 995.959
wanna take a look at it i'll link you up

996.0 --> 1000.6
i'm not subscribed to that [ __ ] anymore

1019.36 --> 1024.48
right so yeah richie

1022.24 --> 1027.76
you were oh i'm gonna

1024.48 --> 1030.24
say oh i don't like the way you're doing

1027.76 --> 1033.76
in my chat but i'm not gonna mention

1030.24 --> 1035.52
your name well i am mentioning your name

1033.76 --> 1037.52
richie

1035.52 --> 1040.959
richie from

1037.52 --> 1043.6
really roxanne channel yeah i am naming

1040.959 --> 1045.919
your name and i'm linking to your show

1043.6 --> 1048.9599999999998
and i just made a little piece in

1045.919 --> 1051.5200000000002
response to this ridiculous situation

1048.96 --> 1053.8400000000001
you got yourself into yesterday on their

1051.52 --> 1053.84
show

1070.559 --> 1075.6399999999999
dude what the hell are you talking about

1094.24 --> 1096.559
right

1099.2 --> 1103.52
and i mean i asked them do you

1101.44 --> 1107.6000000000001
how do you even know this is real i

1103.52 --> 1109.52
asked the guys right in the chat

1107.6 --> 1113.039
and they oh just

1109.52 --> 1115.2
google apec yeah good luck with that oh

1113.039 --> 1118.559
here's a link to his channel and i just

1115.2 --> 1121.2
got two links to a channel

1118.559 --> 1123.9189999999999
and there was no direct

1121.2 --> 1125.679
like oh like if i can just browsing

1123.919 --> 1128.48
through their videos and it's like oh

1125.679 --> 1130.88
here it is here is the demonstration

1128.48 --> 1134.32
video exactly of what that is that

1130.88 --> 1135.44
explains it no no that wasn't there at

1134.32 --> 1138.96
all

1135.44 --> 1142.0
so i swear it they haven't even looked

1138.96 --> 1143.52
into it they're that sloppy

1142.0 --> 1147.96
richie

1143.52 --> 1147.96
from really roxanne channel

1172.32 --> 1178.0
right anyway just needed to get that off

1174.799 --> 1179.6399999999999
my chest

1178.0 --> 1182.72
hey and if he

1179.64 --> 1184.88
miraculously actually is talking about

1182.72 --> 1187.919
something real which i highly dispute

1184.88 --> 1190.0800000000002
since i do distinctly remember in the

1187.919 --> 1191.5200000000002
instruction manual for making colloidal

1190.08 --> 1193.76
silver

1191.52 --> 1195.2
make sure that the water is completely

1193.76 --> 1197.6
unpolluted

1195.2 --> 1199.679
like you have to

1197.6 --> 1200.6399999999999
what do you call it

1199.679 --> 1202.64
like

1200.64 --> 1205.2
make sure it goes through evaporation so

1202.64 --> 1208.96
that nothing is behind like no minerals

1205.2 --> 1210.72
nothing no pollutants because if you do

1208.96 --> 1212.88
then

1210.72 --> 1214.799
it will turn it might turn out to have

1212.88 --> 1217.2
like weird goo

1214.799 --> 1219.52
or blackness or something could happen

1217.2 --> 1221.039
other than it just being that

1219.52 --> 1222.799
transparent

1221.039 --> 1225.76
colloidal silver

1222.799 --> 1228.32
water right distillation

1225.76 --> 1230.559
that's yeah

1228.32 --> 1233.4399999999998
so i remember that in the freaking

1230.559 --> 1235.44
instructions and this guy was literally

1233.44 --> 1237.44
making goo

1235.44 --> 1239.6000000000001
so what do you think my conclusion is

1237.44 --> 1241.679
gonna be

1239.6 --> 1243.9599999999998
well he's doing it wrong and he's

1241.679 --> 1247.2800000000002
claiming that he's found something

1243.96 --> 1248.4
revolutionary based on old alchemist

1247.28 --> 1250.3999999999999
findings

1248.4 --> 1252.799
uh what you mean when they tried

1250.4 --> 1254.96
electrolyte lysis

1252.799 --> 1257.36
on metals and then they used polluted

1254.96 --> 1259.76
water and then goo came out whoo

1257.36 --> 1263.4399999999998
so they thought it was so magical yeah

1259.76 --> 1266.32
yeah it's called pollutant

1263.44 --> 1268.72
it's not that's bound [ __ ] okay that's

1266.32 --> 1270.559
not colloidal material anymore it's

1268.72 --> 1272.96
bound that's why it certainly has

1270.559 --> 1275.44
different properties it's becoming

1272.96 --> 1278.64
transparent goo

1275.44 --> 1278.64
this is ridiculous

1279.44 --> 1281.8400000000001
anyway

1282.64 --> 1286.2800000000002
gonna stop now

1305.919 --> 1310.64
did everybody check out uh

1308.48 --> 1313.6

really good video

1411.44 --> 1414.44
again

1417.919 --> 1423.919
but the jesuits basically focused on

1421.279 --> 1425.679
their organization

1423.919 --> 1429.679
really heavy

1425.679 --> 1433.2
i mean i kind of knew all this but still

1429.679 --> 1433.2
still pretty damn intense

1435.919 --> 1438.48
where is it

1439.36 --> 1445.4799999999998
ah got so many notifications sometimes i

1442.24 --> 1445.48
get lost

1450.559 --> 1455.44
but yeah general thor has just a lot of

1452.88 --> 1458.88
great videos

1455.44 --> 1461.52
we appreciate what he does he's good

1458.88 --> 1461.5200000000002
with editing

1466.48 --> 1471.279
okay yeah [ __ ] off

1469.52 --> 1473.2
rufus

1471.279 --> 1476.64

1473.2 --> 1481.88
my chat is not your

1476.64 --> 1481.88
your bathroom to wake up in okay

1487.36 --> 1491.8799999999999
hey five roads good to see you

1503.52 --> 1506.52

1518.96 --> 1524.72
all right they come take it out

1522.559 --> 1524.72
oh

1525.679 --> 1531.8400000000001
they're so startled so easily

1528.96 --> 1531.8400000000001
but they'll be back

1537.12 --> 1543.84
window damn my windows freaking dirty

1540.08 --> 1543.84
need to clean that up

1556.0 --> 1561.12
okay i need to clean this window

1558.08 --> 1561.12
properly one time

1561.84 --> 1565.4399999999998
yeah not now during the show though

1573.76 --> 1577.4
probably bugs

1590.559 --> 1593.799
she helped

1602.88 --> 1607.1200000000001
did which it ever change his mind about

1604.88 --> 1609.8400000000001
no not that i've heard of rob rodriguez

1607.12 --> 1609.84
hello by the way

1610.559 --> 1613.84
i don't think so

1648.559 --> 1652.44
should have expected that

1671.76 --> 1675.36
right so guys yeah other than this i

1673.679 --> 1677.52
don't really have a lot to talk about

1675.36 --> 1680.08
i'm mostly just kind of recovering from

1677.52 --> 1680.08
yesterday

1680.399 --> 1686.4799999999998
because i slept a lot

1683.12 --> 1686.4799999999998
i did not eat a lot

1689.039 --> 1693.52
i feel i'll be better today but i am

1691.2 --> 1694.559
starting kind of easily pissed off about

1693.52 --> 1696.24
things

1694.559 --> 1701.12
but i could still like talk about

1696.24 --> 1701.1200000000001
whatever if you guys are up for it

1703.279 --> 1708.24
you know i can you know all you have to

1705.44 --> 1711.279
do is ask the right questions

1708.24 --> 1713.2
and not just act goofy in my chat

1711.279 --> 1715.279
which is not what my chat is for even

1713.2 --> 1717.279
though people seem to always try to do

1715.279 --> 1720.159
that

1717.279 --> 1720.159
every now and then

1722.0 --> 1728.64
but yeah is it far as far as goes

1724.24 --> 1728.64
subjects i'm already uh done here

1731.84 --> 1738.32
it is mostly about just warning against

1734.88 --> 1742.7990000000002
don't just get any ass on your show

1738.32 --> 1744.24
because he so seems somewhat interesting

1742.799 --> 1746.96
right

1744.24 --> 1750.88
to figure it out you have to have like

1746.96 --> 1754.08
people with real expert knowledge

1750.88 --> 1756.88
among your friends to check out people

1754.08 --> 1758.6399999999999
whether they are charlatans or not

1756.88 --> 1760.88
otherwise if you're just going to drag

1758.64 --> 1762.5590000000002
them on your show and immediately

1760.88 --> 1764.48
put them up like they're the greatest

1762.559 --> 1767.12
thing ever you're setting yourself up

1764.48 --> 1769.919
for a potential disaster

1767.12 --> 1772.1589999999999
especially when it comes to a person

1769.919 --> 1772.159
that's

1772.64 --> 1777.039
selling you

1774.0 --> 1778.72
or just saying oh i do this

1777.039 --> 1781.919
like ingesting

1778.72 --> 1784.24
effectively experimental goods like

1781.919 --> 1784.24
dude

1786.799 --> 1791.2
unless it's been properly tested and

1789.279 --> 1793.279
vetted like say

1791.2 --> 1795.3600000000001
for example

1793.279 --> 1797.52
turpentine right which is not literal

1795.36 --> 1800.24
the turpentine you buy in store but like

1797.52 --> 1803.6
a specific medical type

1800.24 --> 1805.919
grade and it's gross and it's been

1803.6 --> 1809.039
elaborately tested people are still like

1805.919 --> 1811.039
ew no really you do that what

1809.039 --> 1813.039
yeah and i get that it's gross and it's

1811.039 --> 1816.0
definitely not you should just do like

1813.039 --> 1817.919
oh turpentine oh gluck look no

1816.0 --> 1821.279
no

1817.919 --> 1824.24
but there is medical application

1821.279 --> 1827.279
and there's p a lot of testing for it a

1824.24 --> 1829.36
lot of data to reflect upon so

1827.279 --> 1831.52
there should be people that are into

1829.36 --> 1832.7199999999998
alternative medical things that know

1831.52 --> 1833.679
about it

1832.72 --> 1837.919
right

1833.679 --> 1840.5590000000002
check with them before you pull in some

1837.919 --> 1840.5590000000002
random

1841.679 --> 1847.039
don't just get them on and just

1843.52 --> 1850.1589999999999
immediately assume they're all good

1847.039 --> 1852.559
there's a lot of really [ __ ] up

1850.159 --> 1853.679
charlatans out there

1852.559 --> 1855.76
right

1853.679 --> 1857.2
that

1855.76 --> 1858.32
yeah that are just

1857.2 --> 1860.159
scamming

1858.32 --> 1862.24
and they might not even be doing it for

1860.159 --> 1865.519
the money they might just be doing it

1862.24 --> 1868.72
for the hot spot for satan because they

1865.519 --> 1870.159
can because they think it's funny

1868.72 --> 1873.039
you don't know

1870.159 --> 1875.159
but you could tell if you have any real

1873.039 --> 1876.799
senses to you and this guy just

1875.159 --> 1879.6000000000001
immediately

1876.799 --> 1880.6399999999999
set off all the alarms immediately i

1879.6 --> 1883.1999999999998
mean

1880.64 --> 1884.7990000000002
guys just click the link the first one i

1883.2 --> 1885.519
posted

1884.799 --> 1887.519
go

silver did you know that did you know

1974.399 --> 1979.6
that he was literally

1976.64 --> 1980.96
paid by big pharma

as a shill

1980.96 --> 1986.559
to put out misinformation about

1982.72 --> 1988.24
colloidal silver did you i did

1986.559 --> 1991.12
infamous

1988.24 --> 1993.2
infamous case well this guy was not blue

1993.2 --> 1997.3600000000001
brain damage that either has been taking

1994.96 --> 1999.039
too much drugs or has is literally

1997.36 --> 2002.84
poisoning himself

1999.039 --> 2004.72
he won't even take off his glasses

2002.84 --> 2006.799
okay so

2004.72 --> 2008.96

2006.799 --> 2011.84
revolutionary

2008.96 --> 2013.6000000000001
alchemist and he found out the elixir

like the most brilliant person i ever

2024.64 --> 2030.24

2027.519 --> 2033.24
if it makes me as smart as you sound

2030.24 --> 2033.24
jesus

2047.12 --> 2052.56
i mean never ever

2049.2 --> 2053.5989999999997
take some kind of weird potion from a

2052.56 --> 2054.639
guy

2053.599 --> 2057.04
that says

2054.639 --> 2058.639
yeah i've been taking this for years and

2057.04 --> 2062.32
it makes you smarter

2058.639 --> 2065.04
when he sounds like a [ __ ] [ __ ]

2062.32 --> 2068.76
like why would you do that

2065.04 --> 2068.7599999999998
that's so dumb

2079.359 --> 2082.96
yeah ralph rodriguez yeah colloidal

2080.8 --> 2084.3990000000003
silver is great i've made colloidal

2082.96 --> 2087.119
silver myself

2084.399 --> 2088.7999999999997
it's great stuff my dad

2087.119 --> 2091.359
can also make it

2088.8 --> 2093.9190000000003
colloidal silver is amazing

2091.359 --> 2095.5989999999997
really good especially topical right a

2093.919 --> 2097.2799999999997
lot of people just use it for in

2095.599 --> 2100.0
ingestion but

2097.28 --> 2103.3590000000004
it's great for topical as well like like

2100.0 --> 2105.52
a shaving wound or

2103.359 --> 2106.3199999999997
just any wound on your skin

2105.52 --> 2109.599
like

2106.32 --> 2111.28
and you're gonna put band-aid on it or

2109.599 --> 2112.96
you know

2111.28 --> 2114.88
colloidal silver

2112.96 --> 2116.64
and you don't really need anything else

2114.88 --> 2119.359
just put colloidal silver on that and it

2116.64 --> 2123.44
will literally regenerate your skin

2119.359 --> 2126.4
like two to three times the normal speed

2123.44 --> 2128.4
and it will not get infected yeah burns

2126.4 --> 2131.64
great for burns

2128.4 --> 2131.64
that too

2134.24 --> 2139.839
get it from a left yeah there is just

2136.96 --> 2141.2
professional colloidal silver

2139.839 --> 2143.359
being sold

2141.2 --> 2144.8799999999997
all kinds and there's reviewers about it

2143.359 --> 2148.4
so yeah colloidal silver is a

2144.88 --> 2150.96
well-established alternative cure

2148.4 --> 2152.96
that you cannot officially make any

2150.96 --> 2157.88
claims of but people just know from

2152.96 --> 2157.88
practical experience that it's great

2159.839 --> 2164.48
but it has to be well made you can yeah

2162.32 --> 2166.8
if you if you turn it into

2164.48 --> 2170.2400000000002
silver nitrate which is not colloidal

2166.8 --> 2172.8
colloidal literally means atomic silver

2170.24 --> 2175.52
where it's unbound atomic

2172.8 --> 2177.119
yeah because if it's bound to a nitrate

2175.52 --> 2178.8
then it doesn't work the same and it's

2177.119 --> 2180.56
going to have weird side effects like

2178.8 --> 2182.32
blue man

2180.56 --> 2185.68
right so you got to know what it is you

2182.32 --> 2188.0
can't just like oh some [ __ ] in the

2185.68 --> 2189.68
neighborhood who likes to [ __ ] around

2188.0 --> 2192.64
with alchemy oh he could just make

2189.68 --> 2194.3999999999996
colloidal silver yeah no no

2192.64 --> 2198.0789999999997
no

2194.4 --> 2200.079
you want laboratory quality

2198.079 --> 2202.6400000000003
and there is laboratory quality out

2200.079 --> 2206.6800000000003
there being sold professionally

2202.64 --> 2206.68
with websites and everything

2215.92 --> 2218.2400000000002
huh

2218.56 --> 2223.52
okay youthful skin

2221.04 --> 2224.56
that's new to me

2223.52 --> 2225.44
i guess

2224.56 --> 2228.56
that

2225.44 --> 2230.32
helps a little

2228.56 --> 2232.4
i mean it would be pretty cool if you

2230.32 --> 2234.079
could have even like colloidal silver in

2232.4 --> 2236.96
cream

2234.079 --> 2239.2000000000003
like in face creams and all that why not

2236.96 --> 2241.76
it would be overall good because it will

2239.2 --> 2242.72
help regeneration

2241.76 --> 2244.5600000000004
so

2242.72 --> 2246.48
yeah

2244.56 --> 2248.56
but no i don't really use colloidal

2246.48 --> 2251.68
silver regularly

2248.56 --> 2251.68
i just have it

2254.48 --> 2258.8
i haven't made a habit of using it

2256.16 --> 2258.7999999999997
constantly

2263.28 --> 2266.88
no

2265.04 --> 2268.88

though if you really actually want to

2537.28 --> 2542.48
put it directly into the irwin food fund

2540.24 --> 2544.64
then paypal donations would do a lot

2542.48 --> 2546.4
better since

2544.64 --> 2549.04
yeah i got like

2546.4 --> 2551.359
the new google payment thing

2549.04 --> 2554.0

this is crazy guys yeah google doesn't

2554.0 --> 2559.04
only now take

2555.839 --> 2561.04
like the percentage what was it again 30

2559.04 --> 2562.64
out of the super chats yeah yeah

2561.04 --> 2564.56

so if you thought

2578.48 --> 2582.72
that like

2579.599 --> 2583.76
ending up with three percent was high

2582.72 --> 2588.72
well

2583.76 --> 2588.7200000000003
it's now less than one percent

thanks to 40

2593.04 --> 2599.2799999999997
income tax that i know have to pay

what a total pyramid scam

2720.16 --> 2722.3999999999996
that just

2721.119 --> 2724.2400000000002
yeah

2722.4 --> 2725.839
but i knew that was going to happen tara

2724.24 --> 2728.9599999999996
i knew it

2725.839 --> 2733.119
it's all a giant casino i mean

2751.839 --> 2756.64
can do about it except lose money and

2754.88 --> 2759.2000000000003
gamble more

2756.64 --> 2760.72
that's what it was always

2759.2 --> 2762.7999999999997
i'm sure there's people out there that

2760.72 --> 2764.8799999999997
have been really smart with it and and

2762.8 --> 2766.6400000000003
made a lot of profit

2764.88 --> 2769.839
it is

2766.64 --> 2769.839
a casino though

2772.16 --> 2778.64
and it is run by the banks yeah oh we

2776.079 --> 2779.599
could bypass the barracks and finally no

2778.64 --> 2782.16
more

2779.599 --> 2784.88
dependency on centroid

2782.16 --> 2786.8799999999997
no this is literally their casino that

2784.88 --> 2789.599
they opened for the public

2786.88 --> 2791.92
you understand cryptocurrency is the

2789.599 --> 2793.52
banker's casino

2791.92 --> 2795.119
it just is

2793.52 --> 2798.319
i'm sure there's people out there that

2795.119 --> 2800.079
can use the crypto system for their own

2798.319 --> 2802.4
little

2800.079 --> 2804.1600000000003
dynamic financing and all that sure

2802.4 --> 2806.56
that's pretty cool

2804.16 --> 2809.359
but it is literally just

2806.56 --> 2812.0
juggling with casino chips that's what

2809.359 --> 2814.64
it is that's what that is and hey that

2812.0 --> 2818.24
can work great for you but fundamentally

2814.64 --> 2822.8799999999997
it all comes down to the big casino

2818.24 --> 2822.8799999999997
which is run by the banks

2823.2 --> 2827.9199999999996
right they're gonna have the majority

2825.52 --> 2829.44
they're gonna make the rules

2827.92 --> 2834.16
and there's nobody that can stop them

2829.44 --> 2834.16
because they literally just run the game

2834.96 --> 2840.079
because they can because they have the

2836.72 --> 2842.48
most money to do that

2840.079 --> 2844.8
i mean they can literally manipulate the

2842.48 --> 2847.44
[ __ ] out of any crypto and there is

2844.8 --> 2849.52
nothing that anybody can do about it

2847.44 --> 2851.28
legally yeah

2849.52 --> 2854.319
when that sort of [ __ ] happens in the

2851.28 --> 2856.1600000000003
stock market it's another matter right

2854.319 --> 2858.5589999999997
there might be legal implications

2856.16 --> 2860.72
there's rules there's rules for the

2858.559 --> 2863.599
stock market you know

2860.72 --> 2865.7599999999998
like oh you you can't

2863.599 --> 2868.2400000000002
you can't like give out information

2865.76 --> 2870.7200000000003
about a a change coming in the future

2868.24 --> 2873.2
because then people could like

2870.72 --> 2874.9599999999996
make insane amounts of profit like

2873.2 --> 2877.2799999999997
inside your trading knowledge remember

2874.96 --> 2879.76
that stock market insider trading

2877.28 --> 2881.119
knowledge illegal jail time if you get

2879.76 --> 2882.96
caught

2881.119 --> 2885.839
guess what

2882.96 --> 2887.92
those rules don't exist

2885.839 --> 2889.68
in the crypto market

2887.92 --> 2893.119
oh

2889.68 --> 2895.9199999999996
oh no it's so much better now it's so

2893.119 --> 2898.839
much better without all those rules that

2895.92 --> 2900.48
were there to protect everybody

2898.839 --> 2905.4
yes

2900.48 --> 2905.4
yes of course it's so much better

2915.2 --> 2917.52
ah

2920.64 --> 2925.24
cool show today okay thanks nus

2949.2 --> 2954.3999999999996
hmm yeah i'm really sorry for you man

2951.359 --> 2956.319
territ that sucks

2954.4 --> 2959.6800000000003
but at least you haven't like invested

2956.319 --> 2960.88
your entire life savings in that [ __ ] so

2959.68 --> 2964.2
right

2960.88 --> 2964.2000000000003
didn't right

2989.28 --> 2992.28
hmm

3002.079 --> 3009.04
yeah that sucks derrick it just sucks

3006.88 --> 3010.96
i have no idea if there's like a tax

3009.04 --> 3014.88
system even in the netherlands here i

3010.96 --> 3014.88
just i'm not even gonna try that [ __ ]

3021.2 --> 3027.4399999999996
below a thousand dollar jesus

3024.079 --> 3030.559
you call that not much okay

3027.44 --> 3030.559
i call that a lot

3031.359 --> 3035.68
but okay as long as you know what you're

3033.28 --> 3035.6800000000003
doing

3035.839 --> 3040.5589999999997
because i don't

3038.4 --> 3043.44
i mean in the sense that i i don't know

3040.559 --> 3044.96
too much about crypto i just know very

3043.44 --> 3047.44
rough

3044.96 --> 3047.44
system

3049.92 --> 3054.4
i think for example that jiren

3053.04 --> 3056.48
from germanism

3054.4 --> 3059.28
channel that he he knows a lot more

3056.48 --> 3060.559
about crypto universally

3059.28 --> 3062.2400000000002
right

3060.559 --> 3063.8390000000004
i don't know if you're into that you

3062.24 --> 3065.4399999999996
might even want to take some tips from

3063.839 --> 3067.68
him

3065.44 --> 3071.2000000000003
i'm not into it so i don't really care

3067.68 --> 3071.2
but it seems like he

3071.599 --> 3076.2400000000002
has been digging into crypto

3074.319 --> 3078.48
trading and all that for for quite a

3076.24 --> 3078.4799999999996
while

3079.68 --> 3084.5989999999997
but you probably already know that right

3081.599 --> 3084.599
terry

3109.2 --> 3113.3999999999996
have no hope for it wow

3125.119 --> 3128.119
hmm

3169.92 --> 3174.64
oh you want to see

3172.24 --> 3177.359
the most annoying little short that i

3174.64 --> 3177.359
bumped into

3177.44 --> 3182.0
and and some anti-flat earther i've

3179.28 --> 3184.88
never heard of before

3182.0 --> 3186.319
just has like the most annoying dumbass

3184.88 --> 3187.6800000000003
little shitty

3186.319 --> 3190.88
clip

3187.68 --> 3192.96
about flat earth ever

3190.88 --> 3196.079
this is out there this was like posted

3192.96 --> 3196.079
yesterday or something

3196.72 --> 3199.839
like

3197.52 --> 3199.839
god

3202.16 --> 3206.8799999999997
i mean this guy

3204.4 --> 3208.7200000000003
i'd say would make people like fight the

3206.88 --> 3213.359
flat earth and

3208.72 --> 3213.359
sean hawkins look like freaking geniuses

3218.319 --> 3223.44
right so yeah another like

3221.04 --> 3225.2799999999997
globe death and the growing charlatan

3223.44 --> 3227.2000000000003
market demand

3225.28 --> 3228.4
yeah well that's why these people are

3227.2 --> 3230.64
there

3228.4 --> 3234.48
exactly that sort of people

3230.64 --> 3236.8799999999997
they're there to fill the market demand

3234.48 --> 3240.48
because people are like

3236.88 --> 3242.6400000000003
but i wanted a fully automated world

3240.48 --> 3244.96
where everything just falls into place

3242.64 --> 3247.1189999999997
without you ever having to think about a

3244.96 --> 3249.28
single [ __ ] thing or take

3247.119 --> 3250.48
responsibility and oversight about

3249.28 --> 3252.559
anything

3250.48 --> 3254.88
like oh and then everything turns to be

3252.559 --> 3254.88
fake

3254.96 --> 3260.64
i want to find a new train track where i

3258.319 --> 3263.52
literally never ever have to think

3260.64 --> 3266.319
anymore let's find some idiot out there

3263.52 --> 3268.8
that will tell me it's all right

3266.319 --> 3270.0
you don't have to worry about it they're

3268.8 --> 3272.0
all wrong

3270.0 --> 3273.92
all those people that say things aren't

3272.0 --> 3276.88
the way they're supposed to be as you

3273.92 --> 3278.64
were taught they're just wrong

3276.88 --> 3280.88
there's a market demand for that it's

3278.64 --> 3280.8799999999997
like

3283.359 --> 3289.2799999999997
[ __ ] hypnotism

3285.599 --> 3291.119
it really is it's [ __ ] hypnotism

3289.28 --> 3293.3590000000004
and there's a market demand for it it

3291.119 --> 3295.2000000000003
works really well

3293.359 --> 3296.319
and they flock

3295.2 --> 3297.5989999999997
to

3296.319 --> 3300.72
yeah

3297.599 --> 3304.1600000000003
like the shitty retards just flock to

3300.72 --> 3307.4399999999996
these types of videos like flies to [ __ ]

3304.16 --> 3310.319
every time and there's so many of them

3307.44 --> 3312.799
it really reveals how many incredible

3310.319 --> 3314.96
like [ __ ] up retards there are

3312.799 --> 3316.24
out there

3314.96 --> 3317.839
there's a lot

3316.24 --> 3321.839
i think there's like

3317.839 --> 3326.0
millions maybe billions of them

3321.839 --> 3326.0
that are actively [ __ ] like this

3326.24 --> 3330.16
and there's no hope for them at all and

3328.319 --> 3332.319
they will get themselves killed through

3330.16 --> 3333.68
their own stupidity it's only a matter

3332.319 --> 3335.92
of time

3333.68 --> 3338.799
because it's going to get worse you see

3335.92 --> 3341.92
there's an entropy cycle going on

3338.799 --> 3343.839
once retardation sets in because of

3341.92 --> 3346.7200000000003
disconnection from god because of

3343.839 --> 3350.0
disconnection from yourself

3346.72 --> 3352.319
from your own inside and oversight then

3350.0 --> 3354.4
there is a downward spiral

3352.319 --> 3357.92
because when you get [ __ ] like that

3354.4 --> 3361.119
and you act out on your retardation it's

3357.92 --> 3364.4
gonna get worse and worse and worse

3361.119 --> 3367.28
literally your brain will continually

3364.4 --> 3369.2000000000003
shut down little bit by bit more and

3367.28 --> 3371.6800000000003
more and more as you go

3369.2 --> 3373.68
until you're so [ __ ] stupid you're

3371.68 --> 3375.5989999999997
just gonna cross the street right as a

3373.68 --> 3377.5989999999997
truck is gonna pass by and you won't

3375.599 --> 3380.7200000000003
even realize it because you're that

3377.599 --> 3382.799
[ __ ] [ __ ] you just don't have the

3380.72 --> 3385.7599999999998
normal instincts anymore because your

3382.799 --> 3388.0
brain has literally be rotting

3385.76 --> 3390.48
because of your doubling down on [ __ ]

3388.0 --> 3392.72
retardation

3390.48 --> 3396.319
that's my prediction a lot of these

3392.72 --> 3399.68
people will just die in accidents

3396.319 --> 3401.839
and probably because of vaccines too

3399.68 --> 3407.5589999999997
i mean that's the same category pretty

3401.839 --> 3407.5589999999997
much same way to die pure stupidity

3422.0 --> 3427.079
what the hell are you talking about big

3424.079 --> 3427.079
m

3449.28 --> 3453.52
yeah scott

3450.96 --> 3456.88
i know right i mean how incredibly

3453.52 --> 3458.079
[ __ ] can a video be

3456.88 --> 3458.839
yeah yeah

3458.079 --> 3461.599
i

3458.839 --> 3463.92
know it was that dumb

3461.599 --> 3467.6400000000003
it's not based on evidence it could be

3463.92 --> 3467.64
just governing

3479.04 --> 3483.72
okay yeah [ __ ] off

3521.92 --> 3526.64
which will believe it

3524.64 --> 3529.2
only on the surface i mean as soon as

3526.64 --> 3531.04
they read a single message from a flat

3529.2 --> 3532.96
earth that actually addresses anything

3531.04 --> 3535.599
about it

3532.96 --> 3537.44
god forbid they'd meet an actual

3535.599 --> 3539.28
well-studied flat earther on the street

3537.44 --> 3541.04
that actually has patience for numpties

3539.28 --> 3544.079
like them

3541.04 --> 3546.5589999999997
it's gonna be over very quickly because

3544.079 --> 3549.52
it's just a

3546.559 --> 3551.6800000000003
an internal numpty response to say oh

3549.52 --> 3553.7599999999998
they they don't have arguments they just

3551.68 --> 3556.48
distrust the government i mean it's just

3553.76 --> 3557.6800000000003
wrong that's like never how that even

3556.48 --> 3560.319
starts

3557.68 --> 3563.1189999999997
quite the opposite

3560.319 --> 3565.599
every flat earther went through a very

3563.119 --> 3568.4
severe shock

3565.599 --> 3571.28
once they realized that the government

3568.4 --> 3573.119
lies even about that

3571.28 --> 3577.0
because that's the part that is like

3573.119 --> 3577.0
almost insurmountable

3577.119 --> 3582.4
once you get into that's the thing that

3578.88 --> 3584.7200000000003
really gives you nightmares for a month

3582.4 --> 3586.559
first time you wake up to flat earth

3584.72 --> 3588.5589999999997
it's not because oh we don't trust

3586.559 --> 3592.0
government that's why we think there's

3588.559 --> 3595.3590000000004
no it's exactly the opposite

3592.0 --> 3599.52
a lot of conspiracy theorists out there

3595.359 --> 3602.799
believe anything aliens reptilians

3599.52 --> 3604.88
secret moon bases all that [ __ ] whatever

3602.799 --> 3606.799
it is think of but the earth being flat

3604.88 --> 3609.2000000000003
no no no they lie about everything but

3606.799 --> 3611.359
they can't lie about that it's that it's

3609.2 --> 3612.3999999999996
exactly the opposite of what this guy

3611.359 --> 3614.799
said

3612.4 --> 3617.119
that's why i left a little comment about

3614.799 --> 3620.88
like that's a hundred percent projection

3617.119 --> 3624.6400000000003
about everything you said 100

3620.88 --> 3626.6400000000003
like total mirror reversed world total

3624.64 --> 3630.24
everything he said in that video every

3626.64 --> 3632.319
single word without exception

3630.24 --> 3634.8799999999997
because it's absolutely wrong about

3632.319 --> 3634.88
everything

3638.96 --> 3643.52
about everything except flatter yeah i

3641.04 --> 3646.48
know press of adam but unfortunately

3643.52 --> 3648.88
that is the reality that does actually

3646.48 --> 3651.04
happen and it keeps happening

3648.88 --> 3653.76
right so what this guy says is just

3651.04 --> 3656.7599999999998
utter [ __ ] [ __ ] it's exactly the

3653.76 --> 3656.76
opposite

3656.88 --> 3660.4
it's like

3657.92 --> 3662.0
even when people think the government

3660.4 --> 3664.2400000000002
did everything when they think that the

3662.0 --> 3667.28
government is like literally the puppet

3664.24 --> 3668.799
of satan in every conceivable way then

3667.28 --> 3672.559
they still

3668.799 --> 3674.079
just can't grasp a lot of the time

3672.559 --> 3675.92
that the earth is flat and that they

3674.079 --> 3679.599
lied about that this is like no but that

3675.92 --> 3681.599
part no no that just can't be

3679.599 --> 3685.2400000000002
stop it or i'm gonna bash your face in

3681.599 --> 3685.2400000000002
your monster

3685.839 --> 3691.16
right

3687.04 --> 3691.16
it's like exactly the opposite

3714.079 --> 3718.88
evidence would be good i know evidence

3716.24 --> 3720.9599999999996
for a club would be great

3718.88 --> 3723.6800000000003
like he says all the evidence proves

3720.96 --> 3727.119
yeah yeah that's that's called a a trope

3723.68 --> 3729.2
non-sequitur [ __ ] statement a bluff

3727.119 --> 3730.1600000000003
does he back it up

3729.2 --> 3733.68
oh

3730.16 --> 3736.64
well he showed an orthographic view of a

3733.68 --> 3740.319
globe and then he drew a circle around

3736.64 --> 3742.48
it i mean that's evidence that's like

3740.319 --> 3745.599
all the evidence proves it's important

3742.48 --> 3748.4
yes because you showed an orthographic

3745.599 --> 3751.3590000000004
view globe and then drew a circle around

3748.4 --> 3754.48
it i mean that's the proof man

3751.359 --> 3757.2
that's the proof that all the evidence

3754.48 --> 3759.119
says is a globe you just have to show an

3757.2 --> 3761.2
orthographic view of a globe and then

3759.119 --> 3763.76
draw a circle around it

3761.2 --> 3766.5589999999997
you get it that's the evidence that's

3763.76 --> 3768.48
the evidence it's a globe all of it it's

3766.559 --> 3769.8390000000004
all of it it's just that that's the

3768.48 --> 3771.839
evidence

3769.839 --> 3773.599
you have a optographic picture of a

3771.839 --> 3775.2
globe and you draw a circle around it

3773.599 --> 3777.28
that's the evidence

3775.2 --> 3778.96
what that's not evidence you don't

3777.28 --> 3781.6800000000003
accept that

3778.96 --> 3783.92
like what are you a flat earther

3781.68 --> 3786.16
are you a flat earther you don't accept

3783.92 --> 3788.0
that all the evidence means an

3786.16 --> 3790.0789999999997
orthographic view picture of a globe and

3788.0 --> 3792.24
then drawing a circle around it

3790.079 --> 3795.28
jesus

3792.24 --> 3797.839
you must be really dumb to not accept

3795.28 --> 3797.8390000000004
that

3816.0 --> 3819.52
oops i don't even know who that is

3817.599 --> 3821.76
george sanford

3819.52 --> 3825.52
i literally never heard of that

3821.76 --> 3828.7200000000003
nor will i because it sounds shitty

3825.52 --> 3828.72
alex jones i know

3829.119 --> 3835.92
but he is like a just a jesuit guy

3832.799 --> 3837.68
he is he is just like religiously

3835.92 --> 3839.76
contractually

3837.68 --> 3841.52
obligated to defend his [ __ ] little

3839.76 --> 3845.3590000000004
globe retardation

3841.52 --> 3848.96
and he knows it's flat alex jones knows

3845.359 --> 3851.5989999999997
knows with a big capital k he knows it's

3848.96 --> 3853.359
flat he's lying about it because he

3851.599 --> 3857.599
feels he has to

3853.359 --> 3857.5989999999997
because he probably is a jesuit

3857.839 --> 3863.48
oh no how dare you yeah he probably is

3866.24 --> 3868.8799999999997
does it matter though

3867.92 --> 3871.28
no

3868.88 --> 3874.1600000000003
not really

3871.28 --> 3874.1600000000003
there's a lot of them

3875.76 --> 3880.7200000000003
and jesuits like it's been

3878.72 --> 3883.2
they're a giant organization and they've

3880.72 --> 3886.16
been very old

3883.2 --> 3888.64
jesuits tend to be trained in evil

3886.16 --> 3891.2799999999997
i know

3888.64 --> 3893.7599999999998
personal experience

3891.28 --> 3897.52
but that doesn't mean that every single

3893.76 --> 3899.76
jesuit is like an emperor and in hiding

3897.52 --> 3901.92
or something they're not all like evil

3899.76 --> 3903.44
wizards

3901.92 --> 3905.76
they're just

3903.44 --> 3908.2400000000002
people part of an organization a lot of

3905.76 --> 3910.2400000000002
the jesuits like are compartmentalized

3908.24 --> 3912.16
they don't literally don't even know

3910.24 --> 3915.68
fully what's going on out there and

3912.16 --> 3917.1189999999997
they're even trained to actively keep it

3915.68 --> 3920.799
out

3917.119 --> 3923.52
they're actively compartmentalized guys

3920.799 --> 3924.4
jesuits don't know everything

3923.52 --> 3926.4
they're

3924.4 --> 3928.0
rather exactly the opposite they're

3926.4 --> 3930.96
trained

3928.0 --> 3932.64
not to know everything but to be

3930.96 --> 3934.7200000000003
compartmentalized

3932.64 --> 3936.839
specialists

3934.72 --> 3939.2
and that includes having their own

3936.839 --> 3941.68
misconceptions and dream world about

3939.2 --> 3943.359
reality that it doesn't actually match

3941.68 --> 3946.3999999999996
reality

3943.359 --> 3946.4
that's part of it

3947.039 --> 3951.92
yeah because they're not like oh jesus

3950.16 --> 3954.799
we have to keep each other informed that

3951.92 --> 3956.0
you don't go straight no no go astray do

3954.799 --> 3958.799
that

3956.0 --> 3961.119
yes go astray that's what they like be

3958.799 --> 3963.119
delusional believe it believe this

3961.119 --> 3965.6800000000003
[ __ ] that you've been told to say

3963.119 --> 3968.079
believe it that's what they want it's

3965.68 --> 3970.72
what they want from each other it's part

3968.079 --> 3972.7200000000003
of the gag it's part of the group

3970.72 --> 3976.0789999999997
be delusional

3972.72 --> 3980.24
set the example for the common folk

3976.079 --> 3980.2400000000002
on how to be delusional

3981.44 --> 3984.7200000000003
have you ever thought about that

3983.359 --> 3986.96
that they're

3984.72 --> 3988.16
like that on purpose

3986.96 --> 3991.28
not to

3988.16 --> 3994.319
i know everything and i'm gonna sneak a

3991.28 --> 3995.119
little bit of misinformation through

3994.319 --> 3998.88
no

3995.119 --> 4000.96
they believe they're [ __ ]

3998.88 --> 4002.48
and they're compartmentalized even from

4000.96 --> 4004.799
each other

4002.48 --> 4007.28
they have methods they have objectives

4004.799 --> 4010.4
they don't know everything

4007.28 --> 4012.6400000000003
and they're not even supposed to

4010.4 --> 4013.92
it's like believe what you want to

4012.64 --> 4016.0789999999997
believe

4013.92 --> 4018.559
but just follow these

4016.079 --> 4020.559
rules so like always be ready for duty

4018.559 --> 4022.0
etc etc

4020.559 --> 4023.52
right

4022.0 --> 4025.359
that's what it is

4023.52 --> 4027.2
they don't know everything they don't

4025.359 --> 4029.52
even correct each other when they're

4027.2 --> 4029.52
wrong

4030.96 --> 4033.96
really

4036.72 --> 4039.72
huh

4050.64 --> 4054.96

36 watching awesome

4094.48 --> 4100.56
any of your messages never show

4096.719 --> 4100.56
in life yet that's weird

4103.04 --> 4108.0
i don't know why it might just be the

4105.279 --> 4110.080000000001
the words that you're picking

4108.0 --> 4112.96
i don't have words block but

4110.08 --> 4114.159
there are words that literally youtube

4112.96 --> 4115.6
blocks

4114.159 --> 4118.92
even if you don't have them in your

4115.6 --> 4118.92
banned list

4119.279 --> 4124.319
i think like the word

4121.6 --> 4125.839
[ __ ] or something might be blocked or

4124.319 --> 4128.799
[ __ ]

4125.839 --> 4131.44
like those types of things

4128.799 --> 4134.159

4131.44 --> 4136.799
they're so scared are you doing that how

4134.159 --> 4136.799
dare you

4138.56 --> 4142.64
i mean you can literally just say

4140.44 --> 4144.3189999999995
necrophilia or

4142.64 --> 4146.799
like

4144.319 --> 4149.52
other disgusting descriptions

4146.799 --> 4150.799

4149.52 --> 4154.6
[ __ ]

4150.799 --> 4154.6
how dare you

4162.719 --> 4169.4
no cursing yeah of course whenever i

4165.759 --> 4169.4
feel like it bastion

4178.159 --> 4183.199
well in that case tara 306 if youtube's

4180.88 --> 4184.56
going to do that then i am going to

4183.199 --> 4187.5199999999995
delete

4184.56 --> 4190.2390000000005
my account and go and

4187.52 --> 4195.1990000000005
stream somewhere else

4190.239 --> 4195.199
i will not be accepting that at all

4195.92 --> 4200.4
if i want to say the word fair

4198.64 --> 4206.08
got

4200.4 --> 4206.08
or any of those other words then i will

4206.239 --> 4210.799999999999
and hey if i can bypass that [ __ ] in the

4209.28 --> 4211.759999999999
chat

4210.8 --> 4214.719
then

4211.76 --> 4216.719
i can bypass it

4214.719 --> 4219.12
auditorially as well

4216.719 --> 4220.4
i could just say it i'm gonna say it

4219.12 --> 4223.92
anyway

4220.4 --> 4227.599999999999
i'm gonna bypass it you can't block me i

4223.92 --> 4229.6
will get the word out i will say it i

4227.6 --> 4232.08
don't care if you don't allow it i don't

4229.6 --> 4233.4400000000005
care what you do i'm going to have that

4232.08 --> 4234.719
word

4233.44 --> 4238.199
be said

4234.719 --> 4238.199
and be communicated

4248.159 --> 4252.32
oh okay bashan

4249.76 --> 4252.320000000001
never mind

4255.12 --> 4260.08
it's a weird entry though

4257.84 --> 4263.4400000000005
it's a bit of a trollish entry to

4260.08 --> 4263.44
do that but fine

4265.199 --> 4269.12
i just know if you get in my chat or

4267.6 --> 4271.04
something like that's the first thing

4269.12 --> 4273.679
you say

4271.04 --> 4277.719
might see you as a troll and kick you so

4273.679 --> 4277.719
yeah be wary of that

4294.159 --> 4299.36
yes i get it bashan

4297.04 --> 4301.12
that's why i why i didn't just delete

4299.36 --> 4303.199
you immediately

4301.12 --> 4304.719
because i thought like oh you probably

4303.199 --> 4307.12
mean that

4304.719 --> 4311.96
it wasn't 100 sure but then you

4307.12 --> 4311.96
confirmed it so everything is just fine

4355.36 --> 4358.88
to get rid of this thing so here okay

4357.36 --> 4362.799999999999
thanks godzilla for the membership

4358.88 --> 4362.8
system i appreciate that

4366.64 --> 4372.320000000001
i mean

4368.0 --> 4375.52
yes membership system is not really as

4372.32 --> 4379.12
well rewarding as it is over at nathan

4375.52 --> 4381.6
oakley's who really does have like

4379.12 --> 4383.36
early streams that you can watch

4381.6 --> 4384.8
specifically because of that i don't

4383.36 --> 4387.04
have that

4384.8 --> 4388.56
i have sort of promises of special

4387.04 --> 4390.719
member videos but the last time i've

4388.56 --> 4392.719
even done that is now like two or three

4390.719 --> 4394.64
years ago

4392.719 --> 4395.84
a long time ago

4394.64 --> 4398.64
so

4395.84 --> 4401.4400000000005
but a membership system will give you

4398.64 --> 4401.4400000000005
some credit

4401.52 --> 4403.76
right

4405.679 --> 4409.88
it's sort of like half a wrench

4412.88 --> 4416.88
and you can pay for it with money by

4414.64 --> 4422.360000000001
purely your own decision while wrenches

4416.88 --> 4422.36
i only hand out after personal judgment

4428.719 --> 4432.2390000000005
free super chat okay

4433.199 --> 4437.36
it gives you a bit of money per month

4434.8 --> 4437.360000000001
right yeah

4438.0 --> 4442.239
that's right

4439.28 --> 4444.88
give me a small fee and then

4442.239 --> 4444.879999999999
it takes

4445.52 --> 4450.2390000000005
yeah 40

4447.12 --> 4450.239
taxes out of it

4452.08 --> 4458.08
it's all fine

4455.199 --> 4461.44
if it's free for you then no why not

4458.08 --> 4463.5199999999995
although how are you getting that though

4461.44 --> 4466.32
do you have like a special youtube

4463.52 --> 4469.280000000001
membership that gives you

4466.32 --> 4471.92
like a youtube uh

4469.28 --> 4472.96
platinum or something that gives you

4471.92 --> 4476.719
free

4472.96 --> 4478.32
membership systems that you can just

4476.719 --> 4482.08
do

4478.32 --> 4484.719
you have a special package

4482.08 --> 4484.719
godzilla

remember each month okay

4499.36 --> 4501.679

don't take it too personal

4845.76 --> 4849.84
richie but it does feel like you're like

4848.56 --> 4851.679
my son

you shouldn't be afraid you shouldn't be

4862.239 --> 4866.08
get going to those types of people and

4864.48 --> 4867.28
bringing them home

4866.08 --> 4869.679

4867.28 --> 4871.36
rob your our house

4869.679 --> 4872.96
what what the hell are you doing like

4871.36 --> 4874.96
that's what it felt like to me like

4872.96 --> 4876.88
where the hell did you dig up this

4874.96 --> 4879.199
freaky

4876.88 --> 4881.52
barely coherent hippie

4879.199 --> 4884.879999999999
that claims he has a potion that makes

4881.52 --> 4887.040000000001
you a genius like seriously dude

4884.88 --> 4889.84
so that was really what started today's

4887.04 --> 4889.84
show

4891.84 --> 4896.32
video mess no

4894.0 --> 4899.32
i i don't want to know

4896.32 --> 4899.32
just

4913.12 --> 4916.4
i didn't hear there's like a movie out

4915.04 --> 4917.199
now of like

4916.4 --> 4920.32
two

4917.199 --> 4922.799999999999
women climbing a radio tower and then

4920.32 --> 4925.84
everything goes wrong

4922.8 --> 4926.8
like a super fearful fear of heights

4925.84 --> 4928.32
type of

4926.8 --> 4930.4800000000005
scary movie

4928.32 --> 4932.4
and i'm not gonna watch it because i do

4930.48 --> 4934.5599999999995
have fair heights and even just watching

4932.4 --> 4936.4
the trailer almost make me [ __ ] my pants

4934.56 --> 4938.320000000001
so

4936.4 --> 4941.36
i'm not [ __ ] my pants that's not even

4938.32 --> 4945.04
what happens it's just like

4941.36 --> 4947.12
like wobbly chest feeling i don't like

4945.04 --> 4949.04
that

4947.12 --> 4951.5199999999995
i don't really like radio masks in

4949.04 --> 4953.04
general i mean i'm glad they are there i

4951.52 --> 4954.88
guess

4953.04 --> 4959.28
but

4954.88 --> 4961.679
i don't really like super high up things

4959.28 --> 4964.159
could be heard everywhere

4961.679 --> 4964.159
okay

4967.44 --> 4972.5199999999995
i like those movie like frozen what

4972.88 --> 4979.2390000000005
around the world or across the plain

4974.8 --> 4979.2390000000005
yeah yeah sorry habits

4991.52 --> 4995.1990000000005
i should go to decrease this roller

4994.0 --> 4996.32
coaster

4995.199 --> 4998.239
what

4996.32 --> 5000.96
what do you mean

4998.239 --> 5003.199
i can go on roller coasters

5000.96 --> 5005.04
no that's fine look if i'm all strapped

5003.199 --> 5008.159
in and locked in

5005.04 --> 5010.239
that's fine i'll still feel sick

5008.159 --> 5011.679
but then i can just close my eyes and be

5010.239 --> 5014.239
like okay i'm just gonna trust this

5011.679 --> 5018.4800000000005
technology and if it doesn't if it fails

5014.239 --> 5018.48
then yeah [ __ ] whatever i'm dead

5018.719 --> 5022.719
but i just

5020.639 --> 5024.8
i mean i even liked climbing when i was

5022.719 --> 5026.8
a kid and i would free climb on pretty

5024.8 --> 5029.4400000000005
high at rocks that would be like 20

5026.8 --> 5032.4800000000005
meters tall like above the ocean and

5029.44 --> 5035.12
then jump off in the ocean

5032.48 --> 5038.239
but it like it can't be bigger than that

5035.12 --> 5040.8
it can't be higher like

5038.239 --> 5040.799999999999
i like

5040.88 --> 5044.4800000000005
this type of height

5042.48 --> 5047.678999999999
from this house here

5044.48 --> 5050.239
i'm not afraid of that anymore

5047.679 --> 5051.92
like at all when i was younger i would

5050.239 --> 5053.5199999999995
even be afraid of this type of height

5051.92 --> 5055.76
but i'm not anymore

5053.52 --> 5058.639
but like as soon as it like goes above

5055.76 --> 5060.88
what is it 10 or 20 meters it's just

5058.639 --> 5064.159000000001
like

5060.88 --> 5066.4800000000005
i just don't want to do it anymore

5064.159 --> 5069.719
i really don't like heights

5066.48 --> 5069.718999999999
like that

5071.76 --> 5076.0
traveling to the theme park is more

5073.679 --> 5077.4400000000005
dangerous

5076.0 --> 5079.44
uh

5077.44 --> 5082.159
what

5079.44 --> 5084.32
i didn't know about that

5082.159 --> 5085.839999999999
but roller coasters i'm not afraid of

5084.32 --> 5088.239
roller coasters i love them there's

5085.84 --> 5088.2390000000005
awesome

5089.52 --> 5096.320000000001

5092.56 --> 5096.320000000001
what are you talking about nusnus

nothing coming through just yet

5135.84 --> 5139.52
wait are you talking about meena's nest

5137.92 --> 5141.6
because i would really prefer if you

5139.52 --> 5143.4400000000005
don't call me paul

5141.6 --> 5145.84
nobody on the internet calls me paul

5143.44 --> 5148.5599999999995
just call me arwyn

5145.84 --> 5152.56
right then it also highlights

5148.56 --> 5152.56
because there is a lot of polls around

5153.04 --> 5157.36
just call me irwin there's only one

5154.88 --> 5157.36
arwyn

5157.44 --> 5161.839999999999
everybody knows immediately where you're

5159.199 --> 5161.839999999999
talking about

5164.88 --> 5169.4400000000005
forgot wait do you know me

5167.44 --> 5172.879999999999
do you know me outside of the internet i

5169.44 --> 5175.44
mean i've never even said my name

5172.88 --> 5176.96
like that here

5175.44 --> 5179.12
it is that

5176.96 --> 5181.76
you can figure that out if you try to

5179.12 --> 5182.96
donate to my paypal sure

5181.76 --> 5187.4800000000005
but

5182.96 --> 5187.4800000000005
nobody ever calls that me here

5200.96 --> 5206.08
yeah an elisg that's a fair warning

5204.08 --> 5208.32
i'm in a pretty good mood now i already

5206.08 --> 5210.88
know who this guy is but yeah

5208.32 --> 5212.639
sometimes i do not appreciate jokes

5210.88 --> 5214.639
especially if i'm like kind of pissed

5212.639 --> 5216.400000000001
off or really serious so if you'd made a

5214.639 --> 5218.719
joke like

5216.4 --> 5220.08
an hour ago then i might have kicked you

5218.719 --> 5222.4800000000005
out

5220.08 --> 5226.08
so be careful with that

5222.48 --> 5226.08
never relax okay that

5226.32 --> 5229.44
it's a bit over the top

5231.76 --> 5238.04
it's just if you're gonna make a joke

5233.28 --> 5238.04
then make sure it's actually funny

5247.199 --> 5251.759999999999
and i'm throw another country is

5249.6 --> 5254.320000000001

5256.639 --> 5259.12

5260.639 --> 5264.4800000000005
hadn't even recognized that it wasn't

5262.239 --> 5265.5199999999995
your native language so

5264.48 --> 5267.04
seemed to be

pretty good at it oh yeah of course

5267.04 --> 5271.36
norway yeah

5310.88 --> 5313.36
footage

5314.56 --> 5318.320000000001
what recently watched like this lemming

5316.48 --> 5319.759999999999
documentary

5318.32 --> 5323.32
and apparently there are plenty of

5319.76 --> 5323.320000000001
lemmings in norway

5332.0 --> 5336.4
okay yeah thanks clutch

5335.199 --> 5339.5199999999995
i do my best

5336.4 --> 5339.5199999999995
i had a lot of training

5340.239 --> 5344.799999999999
i mean how many hours

5343.44 --> 5346.799999999999
now

5344.8 --> 5349.52
let's just say

5346.8 --> 5350.56
an average per week

5349.52 --> 5354.4800000000005
i do

5350.56 --> 5356.2390000000005
i do 14 hours a day roughly in english

5354.48 --> 5359.28
just by myself

5356.239 --> 5361.678999999999
then on top of that like another

5359.28 --> 5364.159
two hours

5361.679 --> 5366.88
in the weekdays

5364.159 --> 5368.638999999999
and sometimes ball busters

5366.88 --> 5370.88
also english

5368.639 --> 5373.04
support not not me just the primary

5370.88 --> 5376.719
character talking

5373.04 --> 5377.76
and that for what is it now four years

5376.719 --> 5380.2390000000005
yeah

5377.76 --> 5382.6
a lot of hours

5380.239 --> 5385.5199999999995
oh what

5382.6 --> 5387.92
365 days in a week

5385.52 --> 5391.280000000001
with an average of like

5387.92 --> 5397.32
let's just say three hours

5391.28 --> 5397.32
let's calculate this so three times 365.

5398.48 --> 5404.48
that's one year that's a thousand

5401.44 --> 5407.28
it's 1100 hours a year

5404.48 --> 5408.48
four years

5407.28 --> 5410.719
yeah

5408.48 --> 5414.08
that's almost four and a half thousand

5410.719 --> 5414.08
hours of talking english

5414.96 --> 5418.199
not bad

5421.92 --> 5427.36
i don't even have a strong accent

5424.48 --> 5429.759999999999
well i do my best for that

5427.36 --> 5432.159
i've had a lot of training in

5429.76 --> 5435.04
articulation

5432.159 --> 5437.199
right and i can utilize different levels

5435.04 --> 5439.92
of articulation

5437.199 --> 5443.599999999999
to be more specific which

5439.92 --> 5445.84
funnily enough is when i'm more dramatic

5443.6 --> 5447.679
i articulate better

5445.84 --> 5450.159000000001
isn't that just funny

5447.679 --> 5452.08
so i do that

5450.159 --> 5453.5199999999995
and that works

5452.08 --> 5456.32
but i've always had a lot of

5453.52 --> 5460.159000000001
articulation treat like training by my

5456.32 --> 5462.48
parents because when i was a teenager

5460.159 --> 5465.44
and they were like articulate

5462.48 --> 5465.44
stop mumbling

5466.0 --> 5471.52
no that's still mumbling just speak it

5468.719 --> 5475.12
out audibly

5471.52 --> 5478.2390000000005
like i hate it when you do that

5475.12 --> 5480.32
so happy that they made me do that now

5478.239 --> 5482.799999999999
so happy

5480.32 --> 5486.679
this isn't i hated it as a kid but i'm

5482.8 --> 5486.679

that's that's the funny thing about a

5595.44 --> 5600.239
flat earth is that radio signals go very

5598.08 --> 5603.28
freaking far if you just install them

5600.239 --> 5607.5199999999995
high enough that's why radio towers are

5603.28 --> 5607.5199999999995
so useful because they reach so far

5608.719 --> 5615.88
like who needs satellites they've got

5611.04 --> 5615.88
radio towers so much cheaper

5640.239 --> 5643.239
hmm

5648.639 --> 5652.08
i'm gonna round up the show guys

5652.48 --> 5656.638999999999
ah

5654.48 --> 5660.32
something pretty good i guess

5656.639 --> 5660.32
a lot of criticism today

5661.12 --> 5664.88
i guess that's just the theme for today

5663.199 --> 5666.879999999999
is just yeah

5664.88 --> 5669.04
critical analysis

5666.88 --> 5671.28
right i have to do that too sometimes i

5669.04 --> 5673.5199999999995
mean if i don't do it

5671.28 --> 5675.44
then everybody will just get lazy and

5673.52 --> 5677.679
complace and then think like oh well

5675.44 --> 5679.5199999999995
this is just i could just be myself can

5677.679 --> 5680.719
be a little kid and act like an idiot

5679.52 --> 5683.119000000001
here now

5680.719 --> 5685.199
yeah so i have to actually show that

5683.119 --> 5687.839999999999
there is still critical thinking and

5685.199 --> 5690.08
criticism

5687.84 --> 5692.88
part of what i do

5690.08 --> 5694.96
to show you that

5692.88 --> 5697.52
even though it might not be like the

5694.96 --> 5699.36
most nice thing ever

5697.52 --> 5701.84
i just that's what i do when i do it

5699.36 --> 5701.839999999999
with care

5704.719 --> 5708.639
all right and you know it because i

5706.08 --> 5710.5599999999995
didn't like go foaming at the mouth as i

5708.639 --> 5712.719
would like when i'm actually really

5710.56 --> 5714.639
pissed off

5712.719 --> 5716.88
it was just really annoyed

5714.639 --> 5718.8
because i did meet them

5716.88 --> 5721.52
and i

5718.8 --> 5723.28
do consider them as friends even though

5721.52 --> 5725.6
they seem to be kind of [ __ ] at

5723.28 --> 5725.599999999999
times

5726.639 --> 5729.84
but yeah

5731.679 --> 5734.4
that's not gonna

5736.4 --> 5741.599999999999
never mind uh right

5739.679 --> 5742.56
it's a bit of a weird note to run out on

5741.6 --> 5744.719

there

5783.52 --> 5789.280000000001
right i mean paypal is not completely

5786.4 --> 5791.92
unpolitical at times so if you like did

5789.28 --> 5794.48
support the wrong thing

5791.92 --> 5796.4800000000005
at some point then they might be nagging

5796.48 --> 5800.5599999999995
you've been up to

5798.4 --> 5802.48
right so that could be a thing

5800.56 --> 5803.4400000000005
it's good to be well aware of that sort

5802.48 --> 5805.919999999999
of thing

5803.44 --> 5809.04
right although yeah people that donate

5805.92 --> 5811.92
to my paypal usually don't have problems

5809.04 --> 5814.719
donating to me apparently is not a no-no

5811.92 --> 5817.92
action that gets you kicked off paypal

5814.719 --> 5820.0
