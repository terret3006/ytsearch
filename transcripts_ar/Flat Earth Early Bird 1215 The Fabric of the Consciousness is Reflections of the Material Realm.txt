[ __ ]

87.72 --> 94.56
weather today is pretty glorious

90.97 --> 97.4
[Music]

94.56 --> 97.4
look at that

102.24 --> 108.41999999999999
there's a couple of small little clouds

105.06 --> 112.34
and yeah there are some Trails up there

108.42 --> 112.34
overall it seems less than yesterday

113.64 --> 117.659
it's kind of funny to compare the

115.5 --> 121.28
weather like on my camera compared to

117.659 --> 121.28
the weather on the background of this

122.46 --> 125.479
of the video

127.38 --> 133.62
but yeah it is a really beautiful day

129.66 --> 136.319
it's beautiful wind is a bit cold though

133.62 --> 140.239
very surprising but yeah inside of here

136.319 --> 140.23899999999998
it's really nice and warm

140.64 --> 147.379
you can get find a spot outside of the

142.92 --> 147.379
wind it's also really Pleasant out there

153.12 --> 160.37900000000002
uh Mike so donich first in chat

156.66 --> 163.64
do you have gas head good to see you

160.379 --> 169.26
it is Saturday the

163.64 --> 169.26
16th of April 2022

170.879 --> 176.239
yeah

172.62 --> 176.239
I'm feeling today better

177.239 --> 182.76
yeah much better and my cheek is looking

180.599 --> 184.67999999999998
better and

182.76 --> 186.84
like it's

184.68 --> 188.87900000000002
the situation over there it's starting

186.84 --> 193.94
to basically

188.879 --> 193.94
slow down to more tenable levels

194.099 --> 198.72
right

196.44 --> 200.159
I mean there and also yeah there's just

198.72 --> 203.099
a whole bunch of healing going on I

200.159 --> 206.39999999999998
recognize it because now when I smoke it

203.099 --> 209.51899999999998
actually gets a little agitated

206.4 --> 212.09900000000002
right but that also yeah

209.519 --> 214.739
it's all about the stage of the healing

212.099 --> 217.5
process so it's a good thing

214.739 --> 222.36
also yeah I've been

217.5 --> 225.12
like it still kind of gets full enough

222.36 --> 227.94000000000003
but like yesterday evening I just take a

225.12 --> 231.239
needle disinfected

227.94 --> 234.959
and then kind of it drained myself it's

231.239 --> 236.09900000000002
very easy it's not painful at all now so

234.959 --> 239.64000000000001
yeah

236.099 --> 242.57999999999998
I got the situation under control

239.64 --> 244.73899999999998
I still have a lot to reflect upon about

242.58 --> 248.9
like what happened

244.739 --> 248.9
primary thing I think still that

255.599 --> 260.59999999999997
just somehow panics lived in I don't

258.479 --> 260.59999999999997
know

260.88 --> 268.44
because it's really not that weird to me

265.62 --> 270.479
to get this sort of thing but for some

268.44 --> 272.71999999999997
reason I was just really nervous about

270.479 --> 272.71999999999997
it

273.36 --> 277.68
uh

274.56 --> 280.56
yeah and the problem is

277.68 --> 282.66
if you really know that in advance if

280.56 --> 284.699
you recognize the signs early of this

282.66 --> 287.40000000000003
sort of thing of reoccurring

284.699 --> 289.56
physical problem

287.4 --> 291.9
then

289.56 --> 294.9
if everything works correctly you also

291.9 --> 297.29999999999995
like instantly regain the memory of like

294.9 --> 301.08
how to deal with it

297.3 --> 303.66
but for some reason this time

301.08 --> 305.58
it's almost like I was like had a bit of

303.66 --> 308.28000000000003
Amnesia or something

305.58 --> 310.8
like instead of

308.28 --> 314.039
remembering

310.8 --> 317.94
how to deal with it the mechanics of it

314.039 --> 320.88
by accident I basically Zone in on

317.94 --> 322.86
different time periods of my life maybe

320.88 --> 325.44
because of the pain

322.86 --> 328.46000000000004
and then started to draw in all kinds of

325.44 --> 332.699
issues from that time

328.46 --> 335.9
instead so it kind of yeah my my mental

332.699 --> 335.90000000000003
process is just didn't

340.74 --> 346.1
it didn't work

342.36 --> 346.1
didn't work the right way that time

347.4 --> 352.02
but I'm yeah I'm getting over it and at

350.699 --> 354.72
least

352.02 --> 358.08
right however you look at it

354.72 --> 360.84000000000003
I got like a photo so and I have that

358.08 --> 364.19899999999996
here now it's not just a thing that they

360.84 --> 366.71999999999997
showed me now they emailed it to me I

364.199 --> 368.639
have that I can like keep coming back

366.72 --> 370.5
and like reflecting on that asking

368.639 --> 373.02
others for second opinions about it

370.5 --> 375.84
right because I want to know like what

373.02 --> 377.58
is actually going on in there

375.84 --> 379.919
like what is actually going on in there

377.58 --> 380.88
not just the the quick conclusions that

379.919 --> 384.25899999999996
they

380.88 --> 384.259
dentists seem to draw

388.08 --> 394.34
and yeah with that also reflect upon

390.66 --> 394.34000000000003
people that basically

394.56 --> 400.56
have that kind of mindset too

398.22 --> 404.24
but it's still reasonable and pragmatic

400.56 --> 404.24
like my dad like my healer

404.639 --> 409.319
to just get this figured out like maybe

407.16 --> 411.19
there is at some point something I could

409.319 --> 414.279
do like a special operation

411.19 --> 414.279
[Music]

414.3 --> 419.34000000000003
that would like help me get rid of it

416.759 --> 421.86
forever but in a way

419.34 --> 423.29999999999995
I've already kind of conceded to for a

421.86 --> 424.259
long time like I'm gonna have this

423.3 --> 426.96000000000004
forever

424.259 --> 429.62
I just don't really remember why I

426.96 --> 429.62
decided that

432.0 --> 438.479
I think I must have already had analysis

434.639 --> 440.90000000000003
made and that it is just something that

438.479 --> 440.9
yeah

441.3 --> 445.979
like a physiological aberration or

444.3 --> 448.46000000000004
something

445.979 --> 448.46
anyway

448.62 --> 454.02
so a little reflection

451.62 --> 456.259
uh yeah yesterday's show was decent

454.02 --> 456.25899999999996
enough

457.74 --> 463.139
so I got a bit

460.259 --> 467.36
angry unexpectedly though that wasn't

463.139 --> 467.36
all that great to me I mean

467.46 --> 471.84
sure I had the energy but yeah that

469.8 --> 474.5
wasn't all that great for the cheek if

471.84 --> 474.5
you know what I mean

476.879 --> 481.139
and also afterward I realized something

479.34 --> 483.599
odd

481.139 --> 485.639
about that situation with Bobby steals

483.599 --> 488.78
who is not welcome here anymore no

485.639 --> 488.78000000000003
matter how this turns out

489.419 --> 494.34
but I realized like yeah I never even

491.759 --> 497.099
asked for specifics when he said like oh

494.34 --> 499.67999999999995
I gave them 5 000 Euros I don't even

497.099 --> 501.599
know to what right maybe he gave it to

499.68 --> 504.72
the Red Cross or something

501.599 --> 508.56
he didn't say and I just immediately

504.72 --> 512.88
assumed he he gave it to like

508.56 --> 515.339
yeah military funds or something

512.88 --> 517.26
which is kind of silly afterward kind of

515.339 --> 519.4190000000001
that makes me feel a bit stupid that I

517.26 --> 524.479
did that

519.419 --> 524.4789999999999
right but anyway I just yeah

525.06 --> 530.9399999999999
look I've been offline for two days in a

528.18 --> 533.2199999999999
row and to then come back I'm not really

530.94 --> 536.3000000000001
at full strength just yet I mean this

533.22 --> 536.3000000000001
isn't over yet

536.94 --> 540.9200000000001
[ __ ] off

556.68 --> 562.279
we all forget pain that's why there's a

559.44 --> 562.2790000000001
lot of babies around

564.35 --> 567.45
[Music]

568.5 --> 572.72
all right anyway hello Kevlar

575.16 --> 578.42
man on the edge

591.959 --> 597.3199999999999
that's a good one man on the edge

594.3 --> 597.3199999999999
I doubt it

601.2 --> 605.399
I mean the things that they say mean

603.54 --> 606.66
whatever they want you gotta realize

605.399 --> 609.72
that

606.66 --> 611.3389999999999
when they normally talk to people around

609.72 --> 614.1600000000001
them right

611.339 --> 618.32
that don't know anything about like what

614.16 --> 620.64
they deal with like old science

618.32 --> 622.5600000000001
every day

620.64 --> 624.42
right and dealing with flat Earth

622.56 --> 627.2399999999999
there's people that don't really care

624.42 --> 630.18
about that you think he's gonna apply

627.24 --> 632.82
like any of these crazy anti think they

630.18 --> 636.899
apply their their machinations that they

632.82 --> 640.44
unleash upon us with those people no

636.899 --> 642.06
then then literally gonna use actual

640.44 --> 645.9590000000001
normal language

642.06 --> 648.54
right it's only when they face us

645.959 --> 650.8199999999999
that they go completely reversed World

648.54 --> 652.4399999999999
Apes yet and they start to turn

650.82 --> 654.6600000000001
everything around

652.44 --> 657.0600000000001
like nothing is normal anymore because

654.66 --> 659.2199999999999
they basically want to tear away the

657.06 --> 662.6999999999999
very foundations

659.22 --> 664.62
of the words that we use to describe

662.7 --> 665.5790000000001
what we figured out that they don't want

664.62 --> 667.2
to know

665.579 --> 669.18
so they just

667.2 --> 671.0400000000001
keep twisting and twisting language

669.18 --> 673.7399999999999
until like nothing makes sense anymore

671.04 --> 676.079
but they don't do that in regular life

673.74 --> 678.5
they only do that when they face flat

676.079 --> 678.5
earthers

678.66 --> 681.86
I just yeah

682.92 --> 688.019
right a great example a prominent

685.8 --> 691.019
example would be Brenda

688.019 --> 692.24
and like especially the time she got on

691.019 --> 695.48
with

692.24 --> 695.48
Jim Bob

700.74 --> 706.0790000000001
it just started like who the hell was

703.62 --> 709.5
going to discuss that logic that you

706.079 --> 711.8389999999999
don't need laws of logic

709.5 --> 714.079
this is like what the [ __ ] is wrong with

711.839 --> 714.0790000000001
you

715.44 --> 719.82
he's not gonna

717.12 --> 723.38
bring that sort of [ __ ] up and and just

719.82 --> 723.38
regular life like that

723.72 --> 727.6800000000001
well if you would then everybody would

726.12 --> 729.9590000000001
literally Treat Her Like She's a

727.68 --> 733.3199999999999
complete mental patient like nobody

729.959 --> 737.8199999999999
would start a conversation with her

733.32 --> 740.88
right depending on how her look how she

737.82 --> 742.2600000000001
looks that's probably already not very

740.88 --> 744.8
appealing

742.26 --> 744.8
right

766.16 --> 771.5
relatively level until you zoom out a

768.899 --> 771.5
long way what

773.82 --> 777.9200000000001
hello seeking star Water by the way

780.899 --> 784.56
right yeah

786.0 --> 789.32
how are you guys all doing

812.82 --> 818.72
that's no

815.579 --> 818.7199999999999
it's not gonna happen

822.66 --> 828.18
they're just not gonna deal with you

824.88 --> 830.22
okay so it's pretty much like just a

828.18 --> 834.8389999999999
warning to anybody that might be

830.22 --> 836.88
watching is like oh hey that's cool yeah

834.839 --> 839.0400000000001
if you're actually a person that's just

836.88 --> 841.4399999999999
never seen me before and you're like oh

839.04 --> 843.12
hmm okay I'll just talk

841.44 --> 846.6800000000001
right

843.12 --> 846.68
may have an actual name

847.92 --> 852.959
because there is a troll right now I

850.62 --> 855.24
think it's probably Bobby steals who's a

852.959 --> 859.26
filthy [ __ ] scumbag

855.24 --> 861.1800000000001
like evil evil and gay

859.26 --> 862.92
worst combination

861.18 --> 865.7399999999999
right

862.92 --> 867.12
so I'm literally just going to ban every

865.74 --> 869.519
single new

867.12 --> 871.26
account that I don't recognize straight

869.519 --> 873.779
away

871.26 --> 875.8199999999999
because it's probably him with some

873.779 --> 877.62
stupid little name twist to try to

875.82 --> 879.5400000000001
remind me about what triggered me so

877.62 --> 882.5600000000001
much because he's a [ __ ] [ __ ] that

879.54 --> 882.56
needs to kill himself

888.36 --> 895.8000000000001
so yeah go to your front line of those

893.1 --> 899.16
that you so preciously support

895.8 --> 902.519
and just get blown up already you

899.16 --> 905.779
[ __ ] scumbag okay

902.519 --> 905.779
so let's move on

907.68 --> 911.12
hey Terry 306

917.16 --> 920.66
T is doing a lot of good for me

931.639 --> 937.38
infinity and space-time are just

934.74 --> 942.12
Concepts no empirical evidence of either

937.38 --> 947.579
well Infinity is a numerical concept

942.12 --> 950.899
space-time is a dimensional concept

947.579 --> 950.899
there is a big difference

956.699 --> 962.779
yeah hey guys

959.88 --> 962.779
I told you

971.279 --> 977.3
what is a fractal fractal is a

974.1 --> 977.3000000000001
structural pattern

978.48 --> 985.1990000000001
which is based in algorithmic

982.199 --> 985.199
cohesion

1000.5 --> 1006.279
yeah yeah I know it's you [ __ ] get

1004.04 --> 1006.279
out

1012.92 --> 1018.3389999999999
it's all of them I'm gonna ban all of

1015.019 --> 1018.339
them every single one

1019.04 --> 1026.9189999999999
you're not welcome here anymore you

1022.1 --> 1026.919
filthy [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] off

1106.66 --> 1109.719
[Music]

1118.039 --> 1120.7
ah

1123.5 --> 1129.28
dropping the band have you have no

1125.48 --> 1129.28
choice clutch I don't want this

1131.36 --> 1136.9599999999998
the guy is obviously a deranged

1134.059 --> 1136.96
psychopath

1138.919 --> 1144.919
that has abs like that thinks that he's

1141.5 --> 1147.94
nice right they can be like that they

1144.919 --> 1147.94
can think they're nice

1148.82 --> 1153.2
then they'll just torture you in other

1151.1 --> 1155.78
ways right because that's what they're

1153.2 --> 1159.0800000000002
really eventually drawn to

1155.78 --> 1161.96
torture the torture of people

1159.08 --> 1164.8999999999999
he likes to do it softly he likes to

1161.96 --> 1167.179
make people Rich he's a [ __ ] right a

1164.9 --> 1168.0500000000002
[ __ ] in their own way is a psychopath

1167.179 --> 1170.24
too

1168.05 --> 1173.36
[Music]

1170.24 --> 1176.24
they're really very yimpy

1173.36 --> 1179.32
I'm not saying that I don't know do we

1176.24 --> 1182.32
fair I personally don't even know gimps

1179.32 --> 1184.28
like the real thing

1182.32 --> 1187.22
weirdly enough

1184.28 --> 1189.98
during my Gothic days and parties I have

1187.22 --> 1191.74
seen some people that I would say yeah

1189.98 --> 1195.26
that guy

1191.74 --> 1197.96
that guy is

1195.26 --> 1199.82
probably into that [ __ ] I didn't like it

1197.96 --> 1203.72
I didn't like the radiance I've never

1199.82 --> 1208.84
met like oh yeah man oh my good body no

1203.72 --> 1208.84
no I'm almost like yeah I'll just

1209.72 --> 1213.14
try to

1211.1 --> 1215.12
see if I can find some women that are

1213.14 --> 1217.9
realizing like maybe they're too good

1215.12 --> 1217.8999999999999
for these men

1218.5 --> 1221.86
right anyway

1226.28 --> 1228.94
uh

1230.96 --> 1235.96
but yeah thanks for the support it's

1233.419 --> 1235.96
just that

1239.539 --> 1245.24
I don't like talking like that sometimes

1242.48 --> 1248.84
I feel like when I go off that hard

1245.24 --> 1252.84
I'm like cursing myself in a way right

1248.84 --> 1256.01
what would they say if they hurt me

1252.84 --> 1256.01
[Music]

1258.919 --> 1262.7800000000002
I don't know it probably look bad

1262.94 --> 1266.5
but it's what I feel though

1271.52 --> 1274.0
right

1274.28 --> 1280.76
and yeah you know when there's when

1278.84 --> 1282.799
there is an actual War happening

1280.76 --> 1284.6
somewhere

1282.799 --> 1288.74
both sides

1284.6 --> 1292.34
get Bad Karma both sides get to see like

1288.74 --> 1294.679
super amounts of atrocity and suffering

1292.34 --> 1296.6
and then not knowing what to do with it

1294.679 --> 1299.7800000000002
having to just shove it aside because

1296.6 --> 1303.62
you have to move on to the next thing

1299.78 --> 1306.32
just to keep going right terrible

1303.62 --> 1309.4399999999998
and that knowledge that I have about

1306.32 --> 1312.2
that is the reason why I'm worried to

1309.44 --> 1313.7
just be like this and say like no [ __ ]

1312.2 --> 1316.94
that

1313.7 --> 1319.7
I have sympathy for the Ukrainian people

1316.94 --> 1321.64
but like I am going to pick a side and

1319.7 --> 1324.919
the side is with Putin because

1321.64 --> 1327.44
everything that's coming out already

1324.919 --> 1330.679
right oh the all the propaganda from all

1327.44 --> 1334.9
sides what do you mean from all sides

1330.679 --> 1334.9
like what the [ __ ] are you talking about

1337.34 --> 1344.84
like it's I can't believe it I can't

1341.24 --> 1346.94
believe how much noise there is going on

1344.84 --> 1350.8999999999999
how much insecurity

1346.94 --> 1353.96
about this all and I'm just like no

1350.9 --> 1357.5590000000002
it like everything

1353.96 --> 1360.98
that is like Ukrainian accusations of

1357.559 --> 1364.96
atrocities of some kind from Russia it's

1360.98 --> 1368.059
all lies hundred percent

1364.96 --> 1370.28
exactly a hundred percent and everything

1368.059 --> 1372.9189999999999
they they talk about they show is what

1370.28 --> 1376.76
they did it's their tactic

1372.919 --> 1381.74
it's a combined tactic of scorched Earth

1376.76 --> 1384.679
and heavy War level media misinformation

1381.74 --> 1388.1
so they basically just strike a wound

1384.679 --> 1390.74
accuse the enemy of it as they retreat

1388.1 --> 1393.98
it's very efficient oh everybody goes

1390.74 --> 1395.6
crazy it's monstrous though they

1393.98 --> 1398.6
literally do it to their own people

1395.6 --> 1398.6
monstrous

1398.96 --> 1401.6200000000001
like

1403.82 --> 1409.3999999999999
I'm seriously wondering like

1406.7 --> 1411.559
that's not even tactics that like

1409.4 --> 1414.38
regular German soldiers would have used

1411.559 --> 1417.26
during World War II right I mean maybe

1414.38 --> 1420.44
this hardcore SS officers or something

1417.26 --> 1422.96
might have been very brutal using this

1420.44 --> 1426.26
sort of tactic but then everybody would

1422.96 --> 1427.76
hate them they couldn't admit it nobody

1426.26 --> 1429.919
liked it

1427.76 --> 1431.539
maybe they liked it because they got

1429.919 --> 1434.9
kind of demonically possessed while

1431.539 --> 1436.1589999999999
doing it and [ __ ] [ __ ] up right

1434.9 --> 1439.279
but

1436.159 --> 1441.0200000000002
to see it happening out there on this

1439.279 --> 1444.08
level now

1441.02 --> 1447.02
is scary

1444.08 --> 1448.52
how everybody's dealing with it

1447.02 --> 1452.12
because

1448.52 --> 1453.86
80 years ago there was a level where

1452.12 --> 1456.1399999999999
people no matter what the information

1453.86 --> 1458.36
was they would have some level of

1456.14 --> 1460.94
sensibility in approaching it and if

1458.36 --> 1463.039
they got polarized they would hurt from

1460.94 --> 1466.76
it right that they're

1463.039 --> 1470.26
like people would confront one now the

1466.76 --> 1470.26
way it's just bouncing around

1475.76 --> 1483.94
people just promoting evil

1479.659 --> 1483.94
in such a crazy way now

1494.48 --> 1501.74
where do I get Ukraine info from

1497.059 --> 1504.86
everywhere every thing I basically watch

1501.74 --> 1507.76
that includes Dutch

1504.86 --> 1507.76
sources

1508.279 --> 1514.539
and things through forums through

1511.58 --> 1514.539
YouTube even

1515.659 --> 1520.9
it's mostly just basic report like I

1518.24 --> 1523.58
don't watch like disgusting

1520.9 --> 1526.1000000000001
torture videos or that kind of crap I've

1523.58 --> 1530.559
seen some of it thanks to infoware Shell

1526.1 --> 1530.559
[ __ ] off you [ __ ] [ __ ]

1533.419 --> 1539.7990000000002
dude [ __ ] off and get blown up by a

1537.08 --> 1539.799
freaking tank

1544.52 --> 1550.34
I hope a tank shoots you with an

1547.4 --> 1552.0800000000002
explosive round right in the deck

1550.34 --> 1554.86
okay

1552.08 --> 1554.86
[ __ ] off

1565.159 --> 1569.7
foreign

1566.59 --> 1569.6999999999998
[Music]

1573.86 --> 1578.059
yeah you know it's just gonna Splat him

1576.32 --> 1579.2
all over the place but you get the

1578.059 --> 1581.86
picture

1579.2 --> 1581.8600000000001
uh

1599.36 --> 1605.86
right but the thing is you know how do I

1603.02 --> 1605.86
get my info

1606.08 --> 1611.84
when I get my info

1608.779 --> 1614.059
when it concerns like War reporting what

1611.84 --> 1617.779
do I check for

1614.059 --> 1621.26
I check for genuinity or genuineness

1617.779 --> 1623.0
sorry genuinity

1621.26 --> 1625.76
genuineness

1623.0 --> 1628.22
I don't even listen basically to what

1625.76 --> 1630.799
they're saying to try to figure out

1628.22 --> 1633.6200000000001
I'm just looking if they're

1630.799 --> 1636.799
honest in the moment what who's ever is

1633.62 --> 1639.1999999999998
talking including reporter like if

1636.799 --> 1641.48
that's really the only thing that I pay

1639.2 --> 1643.1000000000001
attention to authenticity thank you

1641.48 --> 1646.159
seeking star order

1643.1 --> 1648.98
yeah authenticity

1646.159 --> 1652.94
if it's just like somebody that like I

1648.98 --> 1656.179
saw this report of this this old man

1652.94 --> 1658.52
that basically had like his daughter

1656.179 --> 1663.02
like blow up

1658.52 --> 1665.74
with like a yeah in their house terrible

1663.02 --> 1665.74
and

1666.799 --> 1673.7
like yeah that was visible to me that

1671.179 --> 1676.22
that was real he wasn't like oh no he

1673.7 --> 1678.74
was like just kind of dead

1676.22 --> 1680.539
and just like a shadow characters like

1678.74 --> 1682.34
yeah that happened

1680.539 --> 1683.96
right

1682.34 --> 1686.539
and

1683.96 --> 1689.539
that's genuine like that report was very

1686.539 --> 1692.539
generous very heartbreaking

1689.539 --> 1694.46
and that's just one thing and you get

1692.539 --> 1696.919
many snap

1694.46 --> 1699.799
videos all over the place and I just

1696.919 --> 1702.679
keep checking for the same thing like

1699.799 --> 1704.779
are these people a genuine or are they

1702.679 --> 1708.279
like oh

1704.779 --> 1708.279
kind of hypish

1712.399 --> 1717.26
I mean I don't understand how anybody

1715.34 --> 1719.72
can really fall for the propaganda

1717.26 --> 1721.7
because it is kind of transparent it's

1719.72 --> 1723.88
like an act they put up when they do

1721.7 --> 1723.88
that

1730.279 --> 1734.899
it becomes almost like this gruesome

1733.22 --> 1738.22
infotainment

1734.899 --> 1738.2199999999998
does anybody notice that

1751.72 --> 1756.08
what are you talking about clutch

1753.86 --> 1758.6789999999999
Ukraine heritage

1756.08 --> 1758.6789999999999
what

1759.32 --> 1762.49
[Music]

1764.95 --> 1768.019
[Music]

1780.08 --> 1782.86
right anyway

1783.2 --> 1788.799
yeah I've been watching some home

1784.7 --> 1788.799
Benjamin from yesterday it was great

1789.38 --> 1792.1000000000001
huh

1809.24 --> 1813.98
I can't watch the [ __ ] yeah now I'm

1812.059 --> 1817.36
not telling you to watch the mainstream

1813.98 --> 1817.3600000000001
news even it's just like

1818.539 --> 1823.64
if there's like a report that was

1820.94 --> 1825.98
mainstream news that's being highlighted

1823.64 --> 1828.6200000000001
like buy some video of

1825.98 --> 1831.26
you know how it's

1828.62 --> 1834.6999999999998
more propaganda

1831.26 --> 1834.7
maybe one of those videos

1836.6 --> 1841.299
like I'm not gonna like turn on the

1838.399 --> 1841.299
regular news anymore

1850.22 --> 1855.799
like maybe at some point like I randomly

1853.46 --> 1859.8990000000001
do do that sometimes just to kind of

1855.799 --> 1859.899
keep a pulse of what's going out

1866.779 --> 1871.0
hey Lydia logs

1871.76 --> 1875.44
you know I banned you right

1875.779 --> 1879.1
didn't unban you

1882.32 --> 1886.9399999999998
but I guess since I've forgotten even

1885.26 --> 1890.44
what it was for

1886.94 --> 1890.44
probably something really stupid

1890.72 --> 1893.44
fine

1902.0 --> 1906.14
cashmere issue is far worse than you

1904.159 --> 1908.779
right

1906.14 --> 1912.3400000000001
yeah I have heard of you I do get to

1908.779 --> 1912.34
hear about that sometimes though

1913.519 --> 1921.76
but the thing is Kashmir is not made

1916.159 --> 1921.7600000000002
into a political world stage issue see

1921.86 --> 1927.1399999999999
I mean if that would happen you yeah

1924.32 --> 1929.1789999999999
then it it could just you know they

1927.14 --> 1931.22
might just get this crazy idea of like

1929.179 --> 1932.8400000000001
oh yeah we're going to make that the new

1931.22 --> 1936.38
thing now

1932.84 --> 1938.24
let's just think right so

1936.38 --> 1940.94
apparently

1938.24 --> 1944.919
Russia China and India are basically

1940.94 --> 1944.919
moving in against the Petro dollar

1945.2 --> 1950.299
well

1946.76 --> 1953.24
maybe Kashmir in the near future will

1950.299 --> 1956.0
become a world stage maybe they're gonna

1953.24 --> 1957.98
move in next like oh oh you want to step

1956.0 --> 1959.96
away from the Petra dollar okay we're

1957.98 --> 1961.58
gonna [ __ ] with

1959.96 --> 1964.299
with that now

1961.58 --> 1964.299
so

1966.32 --> 1970.1589999999999
and it's not going to make it better

1967.82 --> 1972.86
either you know that right

1970.159 --> 1976.7600000000002
I mean world attention doesn't actually

1972.86 --> 1979.6999999999998
make conflicts resolve

1976.76 --> 1981.559
they just abuse it to destabilize the

1979.7 --> 1984.2
place more that's what it's actually

1981.559 --> 1987.98
being used for

1984.2 --> 1990.76
it's like the world beast system just

1987.98 --> 1993.44
finds weaknesses and arguments and

1990.76 --> 1998.679
rivalries and then just starts poking

1993.44 --> 1998.679
that if they want the thing to collapse

1999.14 --> 2002.159
that's what they do

2027.1 --> 2032.3799999999999
the tuition probably never resolve right

2029.679 --> 2034.72
well I I'm not even too sure like what

2032.38 --> 2037.779
the fundamental issue is about the

2034.72 --> 2041.74
province like what makes it worth

2037.779 --> 2044.38
constantly having Wars over right

2041.74 --> 2045.82
why is there some unique resource there

2044.38 --> 2048.579
or

2045.82 --> 2051.879
some religious historical significance

2048.579 --> 2054.28
that neither parties can let go of

2051.879 --> 2056.879
like what is it exactly do you know

2054.28 --> 2056.8790000000004
Tarot

2093.639 --> 2096.359
hmm

2109.42 --> 2113.98
wow

2110.92 --> 2116.26
okay so it's almost like an a cultural

2113.98 --> 2119.38
issue that it can't be let go

2116.26 --> 2121.3590000000004
is it like the province of Victory or or

2119.38 --> 2123.76
Destiny or something

2121.359 --> 2125.3199999999997
because you didn't mention any like

2123.76 --> 2127.599
Industrial

2125.32 --> 2131.079
points

2127.599 --> 2132.94
that it's like highly Financial or

2131.079 --> 2134.5600000000004
or anything like you didn't mention any

2132.94 --> 2138.599
of that

2134.56 --> 2138.599
religious political historical

2144.4 --> 2147.2400000000002
hey Rick back

2164.619 --> 2168.96
oh

2165.94 --> 2168.96
okay we're back

2204.94 --> 2210.4
yeah yeah right back American News

2208.3 --> 2215.3390000000004
uses all kinds of like

2210.4 --> 2215.339
visual auditory mind control [ __ ]

2220.18 --> 2224.74
well I've noticed that Alex Jones is

2222.579 --> 2228.099
basically starting yeah he's been doing

2224.74 --> 2231.0989999999997
that for quite a while but

2228.099 --> 2233.1400000000003
like he keeps slowly cranking up that

2231.099 --> 2235.9
level

2233.14 --> 2239.74
I mean technically now like

2235.9 --> 2240.579
it's also like better suited for the

2239.74 --> 2243.7
weird

2240.579 --> 2245.92
messages and all that and some good man

2243.7 --> 2250.0
he does have some good messages but it's

2245.92 --> 2254.079
also beefed up it's kind of

2250.0 --> 2256.359
out of proportion ineffective really to

2254.079 --> 2258.76
really build intellectually with it's

2256.359 --> 2262.06
more just like oh emotional support

2258.76 --> 2265.079
we're on that side or something right

2262.06 --> 2265.0789999999997
and yeah

2265.42 --> 2268.02
but

2268.839 --> 2275.38
like what's happening now like typically

2271.78 --> 2278.02
when I watch Infowars it's like

2275.38 --> 2280.96
just as bad if not worse than like

2278.02 --> 2284.2599999999998
watching regular advertisement in the

2280.96 --> 2286.599
90s American advertisement

2284.26 --> 2289.9
right in the 90s at for Dutch

2286.599 --> 2292.26
advertisement wasn't that terrible yet

2289.9 --> 2295.359
it was already like

2292.26 --> 2297.2200000000003
it had manipulative quality they did try

2295.359 --> 2299.14
to program culture right I didn't even

2297.22 --> 2302.0789999999997
see it back then

2299.14 --> 2306.64
but it was all much more

2302.079 --> 2309.28
just well what we thought as European

2306.64 --> 2312.5789999999997
and the American stuff like the way they

2309.28 --> 2314.619
did advertising was just atrocious to us

2312.579 --> 2317.619
like oh

2314.619 --> 2320.32
this is terrible it's so aggressive and

2317.619 --> 2323.619
manipulative and just an assault on your

2320.32 --> 2326.2000000000003
senses and that was the 90s

2323.619 --> 2329.5
right so we didn't watch that

2326.2 --> 2332.68
we did not watch American channels yeah

2329.5 --> 2334.06
in the Netherlands oh no we had a lot of

2332.68 --> 2335.56
American

2334.06 --> 2338.5
spoken

2335.56 --> 2340.359
movies and series and then we just gave

2338.5 --> 2342.76
them Dutch subtitles and we had Dutch

2340.359 --> 2344.88
advertisement in between not freaking

2342.76 --> 2347.0200000000004
psycho American

2344.88 --> 2348.82
advertisements right

2347.02 --> 2351.4
but then

2348.82 --> 2353.56
around 2000

2351.4 --> 2356.8
I really started to notice there was

2353.56 --> 2359.02
like this alteration and it's like the

2356.8 --> 2361.3590000000004
advertisement started to mutate become

2359.02 --> 2362.8
more corporate and then

2361.359 --> 2367.42
like this

2362.8 --> 2370.7400000000002
weird melange of professionalism and

2367.42 --> 2372.4
like mind-twisting

2370.74 --> 2375.7599999999998
manipulation

2372.4 --> 2378.339
and it was getting really [ __ ] up

2375.76 --> 2380.98
and now

2378.339 --> 2384.64
I'd say that in the Dutch advertisement

2380.98 --> 2389.7
is just as invasive and terrible if not

2384.64 --> 2389.7
worse as 90s American commercials

2399.359 --> 2402.94
anyway I barely know what I'm talking

2401.56 --> 2403.83
about it don't have any specific

2402.94 --> 2406.48
examples

2403.83 --> 2408.46
[Music]

2406.48 --> 2411.579
but it is kind of funny now like there's

2408.46 --> 2414.94
even like review shows

2411.579 --> 2416.2200000000003
of old advertisements and it's really

2414.94 --> 2419.27
weird to see that back

2416.22 --> 2419.27
[Music]

2434.5 --> 2437.339
hmm

2438.4 --> 2441.599
[Music]

2444.85 --> 2447.94
[Music]

2458.92 --> 2461.92
foreign

2512.02 --> 2515.339
yeah right back

2516.7 --> 2519.8999999999996
well you know

2523.0 --> 2527.2
how

2524.74 --> 2529.359
well just if you realize of how many

2527.2 --> 2532.859
people are just dying from taking

2529.359 --> 2532.859
vaccines right now

2533.14 --> 2536.0789999999997
it's a lot

2534.76 --> 2538.599
right

2536.079 --> 2541.8390000000004
well I think

2538.599 --> 2544.78
that probably due to programming of

2541.839 --> 2547.0
media from the first get-go

2544.78 --> 2548.1400000000003
and just general culture and just

2547.0 --> 2553.24
wanting it

2548.14 --> 2555.819
everybody overestimates how

2553.24 --> 2559.3799999999997
smart the average person is and that

2555.819 --> 2559.38
they are actually just

2560.5 --> 2568.66
so badly in control over their own

2565.24 --> 2571.2999999999997
faculties and insight on how to deal

2568.66 --> 2574.42
with complexities

2571.3 --> 2576.46
that they get themselves I guess easily

2574.42 --> 2578.319
killed

2576.46 --> 2581.44
like this

2578.319 --> 2584.099
it just happens

2581.44 --> 2584.099
so

2585.099 --> 2589.1800000000003
I think they're probably in the same

2587.26 --> 2592.7200000000003
category

2589.18 --> 2594.64
I mean I'd like to see some kind of

2592.72 --> 2596.74
background research if that ever happens

2594.64 --> 2600.48
if anybody cares

2596.74 --> 2603.2799999999997
how many like confirmed vaccine damage

2600.48 --> 2604.839
vaccine fatalities

2603.28 --> 2608.02
were

2604.839 --> 2611.619
television Watchers

2608.02 --> 2615.339
like regular television

2611.619 --> 2616.42
compared to how many didn't and like did

2615.339 --> 2617.98
their thing through internet right

2616.42 --> 2620.38
because you can actually watch

2617.98 --> 2624.18
television on the internet right when

2620.38 --> 2624.1800000000003
I'm talking about regular television

2626.74 --> 2633.2799999999997
how many of those actually were among

2629.46 --> 2636.2200000000003
fatalities with vaccinated versus those

2633.28 --> 2639.42
that don't have a television but a

2636.22 --> 2639.4199999999996
computer or something or a phone

2644.02 --> 2647.02
anyway

2658.839 --> 2666.2999999999997
what the hell

2661.78 --> 2666.3
yeah Lydia logs that's really dumb

2668.079 --> 2671.92
you think that if Britain's gonna take

2670.18 --> 2674.5
over India

2671.92 --> 2676.839
that that's gonna fix the situation in

2674.5 --> 2679.98
Cashmere

2676.839 --> 2679.98
are you nuts

2682.78 --> 2687.88
like how is it gonna fix it by Britain

2685.18 --> 2693.54
just giving it away

2687.88 --> 2693.54
or by Britain like winning that war

2693.819 --> 2698.04
you think I don't know would Pakistan

2698.619 --> 2702.54
yep well who knows right

2703.0 --> 2708.28
when like the entire control of a

2705.579 --> 2711.2200000000003
country changes then usually neighboring

2708.28 --> 2715.42
countries tend to make deals

2711.22 --> 2719.3799999999997
with the new powers very quickly

2715.42 --> 2722.26
so maybe but yeah why the hell

2719.38 --> 2726.1800000000003
would anybody in India actually want to

2722.26 --> 2726.1800000000003
be ruled by Britain again

2729.42 --> 2735.52
like especially at this point right if

2732.88 --> 2737.8
you'd say like oh well 40 years ago

2735.52 --> 2741.52
perhaps

2737.8 --> 2744.2200000000003
then I'd be like whoa you know they have

2741.52 --> 2746.8
the BBC BBC is freaking awesome

2744.22 --> 2748.1189999999997
right perhaps some Indians would have

2746.8 --> 2750.76
been like yeah

2748.119 --> 2752.98
oh well maybe

2750.76 --> 2755.5600000000004
right now

2752.98 --> 2757.48
with what's going on in Britain and like

2755.56 --> 2760.7999999999997
how they changed

2757.48 --> 2760.8
no [ __ ] way

2765.819 --> 2771.22
yeah so what Lydia logs

2769.96 --> 2774.28
yeah

2771.22 --> 2777.339
so what

2774.28 --> 2781.6600000000003
do you do written build Railway stations

2777.339 --> 2785.099
yeah they're also sjw [ __ ] freaks

2781.66 --> 2788.3999999999996
right now and part of like like

2785.099 --> 2791.579
depopulation New World Order

2788.4 --> 2795.339
craziness okay

2791.579 --> 2799.92
hysteria you think India wants that to

2795.339 --> 2799.92
take over are you [ __ ] kidding me

2802.06 --> 2806.02
do you know anything about Indian

2804.52 --> 2809.04
culture

2806.02 --> 2809.04
anything at all

2811.66 --> 2818.2
like do you know their habits like what

2814.599 --> 2818.2000000000003
is normal there

2820.359 --> 2825.52
the crazy you're crazy if you think that

2823.3 --> 2828.579
they're they want to be

2825.52 --> 2831.16
that they'd be better off right now but

2828.579 --> 2833.7000000000003
colonized by Britain that's completely

2831.16 --> 2833.7
insane

2834.4 --> 2837.1800000000003
seriously

2843.76 --> 2848.8190000000004
get the [ __ ] out of here you filthy Nazi

2846.4 --> 2848.819
supporter

2871.54 --> 2877.119
that's right yeah I'm with you Derek I

2874.3 --> 2880.8
mean India there's still a lot of room

2877.119 --> 2885.4
for improvement right but you can't just

2880.8 --> 2886.6600000000003
all at once Bang Yeah it's a massive

2885.4 --> 2889.119
country

2886.66 --> 2891.2799999999997
that's really tough I mean you have to

2889.119 --> 2894.2200000000003
be like this

2891.28 --> 2896.38
smooth oiled machine in order to have

2894.22 --> 2899.68
like a massive transformation quickly

2896.38 --> 2901.3
but I know India's trying and they're

2899.68 --> 2902.3799999999997
just kind of like building from the

2901.3 --> 2904.54
center up

2902.38 --> 2906.46
and I really hope that eventually like

2904.54 --> 2908.68
they will

2906.46 --> 2911.14
especially like deal with the pollution

2908.68 --> 2913.54
issues I think that if India like

2911.14 --> 2916.839
completely becomes like super clean

2913.54 --> 2919.42
right I don't mean to move CO2 [ __ ]

2916.839 --> 2921.16
but actual poison in the ground and [ __ ]

2919.42 --> 2924.579
and gas

2921.16 --> 2928.2999999999997
you know factories like actual pollution

2924.579 --> 2930.04
if they get that like really fixed

2928.3 --> 2933.2200000000003
and I know there's a lot of chemical

2930.04 --> 2936.7599999999998
Geniuses in India

2933.22 --> 2938.859
dude it could literally

2936.76 --> 2941.7000000000003
become like a Cornerstone of the

2938.859 --> 2941.7
industrial world

2960.579 --> 2964.7200000000003
and on top of that

2962.92 --> 2966.46
actually

2964.72 --> 2967.9599999999996
get a bit of a

2966.46 --> 2970.059
a better

2967.96 --> 2971.559
tourist property as well I mean if

2970.059 --> 2973.2400000000002
everything cleans up

2971.559 --> 2975.48
it's going to be a lot more appealing

2973.24 --> 2975.4799999999996
right

2977.74 --> 2983.859
I mean there are already like this

2981.4 --> 2985.0
specialized zones there that they use

2983.859 --> 2987.819
for this

2985.0 --> 2989.68
on everything just universally cleans up

2987.819 --> 2991.839
ever then everything else is only going

2989.68 --> 2993.7599999999998
to improve more

2991.839 --> 2996.119
including the regions that were already

2993.76 --> 2996.119
clean

3019.44 --> 3026.04
wow Lydia dude what kind of a [ __ ] Are

3022.859 --> 3026.04
you seriously

3027.859 --> 3033.9
I'm trying to have a reasonable

3030.66 --> 3037.5
discussion here and now you now after

3033.9 --> 3039.359
all that that's what you bring up

3037.5 --> 3042.48
people [ __ ] in the streets I mean

3039.359 --> 3044.94
I've joked about that

3042.48 --> 3047.16
but it's not like it's a cultural thing

3044.94 --> 3049.5
they do

3047.16 --> 3052.44
it's kind of just neglect and poverty

3049.5 --> 3055.339
and they still have that in like yeah

3052.44 --> 3055.339
slum zones

3057.54 --> 3062.4
that's not like it's not like California

3059.64 --> 3064.319
where they just do it on the sidewalk of

3062.4 --> 3066.859
some Main Street or something

3064.319 --> 3066.859
right

3076.8 --> 3082.8
also I have known that there have been a

3079.8 --> 3084.54
lot of effort put into well basic

3082.8 --> 3087.2400000000002
kind of like typical government

3084.54 --> 3089.94
education on just like proper hygiene

3087.24 --> 3092.7599999999998
it's been going on for a while but they

3089.94 --> 3096.96
have stepped it up even more

3092.76 --> 3099.5400000000004
so I am really expecting India

3096.96 --> 3102.54
they don't get caught up in some [ __ ]

3099.54 --> 3105.3
up scheme where everybody dies there's a

3102.54 --> 3108.319
pollution [ __ ] and India could like

3105.3 --> 3108.319
really become

3109.92 --> 3113.119
better what

3124.859 --> 3128.54
hey Neil degrass Tyson lies

3135.9 --> 3141.14
okay yeah right back I I thought so but

3138.839 --> 3144.359
I think it she meant [ __ ] because

3141.14 --> 3146.64
doing their doobies in the street

3144.359 --> 3149.22
doesn't exactly sound like it's a

3146.64 --> 3152.8799999999997
metaphor for a joint right back so I

3149.22 --> 3156.14
think that Lydia Locke simply just

3152.88 --> 3156.1400000000003
used the wrong word

3165.9 --> 3172.92
apparently she calls

3168.42 --> 3172.92
poo doobies weird

3173.28 --> 3175.8190000000004
fine

3178.92 --> 3182.76
oh and the UK dog owners have to pick

3181.26 --> 3185.3
yeah

3182.76 --> 3185.3
cool

3189.24 --> 3193.14
no it's not

3191.46 --> 3195.92
Lydia logs

3193.14 --> 3195.92
no it's not

3197.339 --> 3201.119
see

3198.48 --> 3202.7400000000002
but I saw exactly what she meant though

3201.119 --> 3204.78
right

3202.74 --> 3206.3999999999996
I'm not gonna get hung up on using the

3204.78 --> 3210.44
wrong word just identified what she

3206.4 --> 3210.44
actually meant by the context

3212.339 --> 3216.7799999999997
and she's been smoking the wrong kind of

3214.68 --> 3219.4199999999996
[ __ ]

3216.78 --> 3220.8700000000003
yeah Matthew Hall

3219.42 --> 3222.1800000000003
oh damn

3220.87 --> 3223.92
[Music]

3222.18 --> 3225.18
right well that's why I call her Lydia

3223.92 --> 3227.78
logs

3225.18 --> 3227.7799999999997
so

3231.48 --> 3234.859
a logical observation

3237.53 --> 3240.599
[Music]

3245.339 --> 3248.48
hey Godzilla

3262.859 --> 3269.359
it's Labrador I don't get it

3265.26 --> 3269.3590000000004
is that classic what

3288.859 --> 3292.64
okay Matthew all

3295.22 --> 3299.7799999999997
Cheech and Chong reference oh [ __ ]

3301.14 --> 3306.5989999999997
I hate

3302.76 --> 3309.599
I recognize those words and I know it's

3306.599 --> 3312.42
probably some like 80s

3309.599 --> 3315.5
television series but I I've never seen

3312.42 --> 3318.98
it I've just heard of that word before

3315.5 --> 3318.98
or that name

3320.7 --> 3326.5989999999997
oh by the way Neil deGrasse Tyson lies

3323.28 --> 3326.599
light before the tunnel

3348.059 --> 3350.2400000000002
thank you

3351.299 --> 3356.24
hmm

3352.92 --> 3356.2400000000002
okay right back

3358.68 --> 3364.2599999999998
I really missed out on something there

3361.68 --> 3367.0989999999997
I think like not even my parents have

3364.26 --> 3367.099
heard of that

3370.2 --> 3372.74
no

3375.18 --> 3382.319
right but you have to realize also that

3379.559 --> 3385.02
like how media basically was getting

3382.319 --> 3386.88
transferred right I the weird thing is I

3385.02 --> 3389.16
know about that because that is one of

3386.88 --> 3391.079
the things that I was as an individual

3389.16 --> 3393.1189999999997
for some reason paying a lot of

3391.079 --> 3395.94
attention to

3393.119 --> 3398.6400000000003
so in the 70s there was really not a lot

3395.94 --> 3400.26
of media from America that was getting

3398.64 --> 3403.3799999999997
transferred

3400.26 --> 3408.059
to the Netherlands yet

3403.38 --> 3410.6400000000003
uh just a couple of things maybe

3408.059 --> 3413.6400000000003
then in the 80s that increased a lot

3410.64 --> 3416.22
like a lot of popular series like a team

3413.64 --> 3419.04
and Knight Rider and all that stuff

3416.22 --> 3424.68
right all of that stuff the typical

3419.04 --> 3427.46
it got right in our in our television

3424.68 --> 3430.02
and we became like oh yeah American

3427.46 --> 3432.48
series that some of them are kind of

3430.02 --> 3434.46
cool and some of them sucked and then

3432.48 --> 3436.619
everybody agreed on that and then we

3434.46 --> 3439.079
didn't get to see those really sucky

3436.619 --> 3441.299
series because there was some really

3439.079 --> 3444.0
terrible American stuff too

3441.299 --> 3445.859
it was just like really freaking dumb

3444.0 --> 3449.18
and pointless

3445.859 --> 3449.18
to us duchies

3449.76 --> 3454.92
but before that time a lot of those

3452.52 --> 3456.599
series like from the 70s like nobody's

3454.92 --> 3458.4
ever heard of that here like ever

3456.599 --> 3460.7400000000002
because it was never on the television

3458.4 --> 3464.76
ever here

3460.74 --> 3469.02
or everybody here knows about the A-Team

3464.76 --> 3472.4
right or well of kind of my age category

3469.02 --> 3475.2
and the people in their 40s and 50s yeah

3472.4 --> 3477.839
pretty much people

3475.2 --> 3480.0589999999997
40 and older they all know the a team

3477.839 --> 3481.98
they all have heard of Knight Rider and

3480.059 --> 3484.5
all that right

3481.98 --> 3487.7400000000002
Alf right

3484.5 --> 3489.92
all that stuff Hello Luna love you by

3487.74 --> 3489.9199999999996
the way

3490.5 --> 3493.22
propaganda

3498.0 --> 3503.119
but apparently it is really a thing that

3500.52 --> 3506.16
a lot of Americans like to joke about

3503.119 --> 3509.2200000000003
sometimes referencing Chi Chin chong and

3506.16 --> 3512.0
then every time like what I absolutely

3509.22 --> 3512.0
don't get this

3513.0 --> 3518.28
is

3514.92 --> 3520.559
but I do recognize the name every time

3518.28 --> 3523.1400000000003
because I just heard you're you must

3520.559 --> 3526.26
have been like the the 10th American

3523.14 --> 3528.66
like in the last 30 years that have made

3526.26 --> 3531.119
some kind of weird remark about it and

3528.66 --> 3533.94
then mentioned Cheech and Chong and I

3531.119 --> 3536.4
was like okay

3533.94 --> 3538.84
so I remember that name being settled I

3536.4 --> 3541.9590000000003
never got the jokes though

3538.84 --> 3541.9590000000003
[Music]

3555.359 --> 3559.68
what the [ __ ]

3557.46 --> 3561.299
Rich from SC

3559.68 --> 3563.5789999999997
issors

3561.299 --> 3566.42
wow

3563.579 --> 3566.42
harsh man

3572.52 --> 3575.42
this is

3576.66 --> 3580.819
that is kind of hilarious though

3582.559 --> 3587.52
did it have the Airwolf music too when

3585.599 --> 3589.88
that happened or was it just like really

3587.52 --> 3589.88
dark

3607.64 --> 3613.16
Sarah thank you for that that is

3610.2 --> 3613.16
actually kind of funny

3616.68 --> 3623.3999999999996
I mean holy [ __ ] like seriously use an

3620.4 --> 3625.2000000000003
actual like weapon helicopter to blow me

3623.4 --> 3626.7000000000003
up with the missile

3625.2 --> 3629.52
damn

3626.7 --> 3632.339
I must be some real serious threat then

3629.52 --> 3635.42
like I'm just a guy I basically don't

3632.339 --> 3635.42
even leave the city

3635.76 --> 3639.8590000000004
I've never committed violence

3639.9 --> 3644.059
or what yeah no

3644.16 --> 3651.66
and on record anyway

3647.16 --> 3654.299
no but never oh God anyway I have a

3651.66 --> 3656.16
perfectly clean record

3654.299 --> 3658.46
it's a kid I've done all kinds of [ __ ]

3656.16 --> 3658.46
but

3659.579 --> 3664.2000000000003
and I'm just talking and I'm blabbering

3661.619 --> 3668.52
and I'm like laying out everything like

3664.2 --> 3670.6189999999997
including the embarrassing things the

3668.52 --> 3673.079
try to avoid inappropriate things but

3670.619 --> 3677.42
yeah then again I also have to draw in

3673.079 --> 3677.42
that because that's the issue of the day

3680.819 --> 3684.54
right that's what we're all dealing with

3682.74 --> 3688.02
now

3684.54 --> 3689.579
I'm forced to basically do that

3688.02 --> 3691.92
Shake everybody out of their comfort

3689.579 --> 3695.42
zone but it's also my comfort zone I

3691.92 --> 3695.42
shake myself out doing that

3695.76 --> 3701.94
so I've presented myself very vulnerable

3699.48 --> 3704.76
I share a lot of personal like why would

3701.94 --> 3706.7400000000002
anybody like need to blow me up

3704.76 --> 3709.38
like that

3706.74 --> 3712.0789999999997
I mean I think they could find much more

3709.38 --> 3715.1400000000003
efficient ways to get me out of the way

3712.079 --> 3717.539
like and nobody would ever find out or

3715.14 --> 3719.96
maybe they would in the whatever like

3717.539 --> 3719.96
why

3723.24 --> 3728.4799999999996
you shatter people's paradigms

3725.94 --> 3728.48
I do

3734.88 --> 3737.42
okay

3738.599 --> 3741.799
I do my best

3745.14 --> 3749.2799999999997
I just want people to retain their

3748.02 --> 3751.859
faculties

3749.28 --> 3754.099
that's all

3751.859 --> 3754.0989999999997
right

3761.94 --> 3768.38
to know what is real in this age is kind

3765.24 --> 3768.3799999999997
of a challenge for everybody

3771.24 --> 3779.5389999999998
I mean your own delusions are gonna be

3775.64 --> 3779.5389999999998
weaponized against you

3780.119 --> 3783.38
no matter what you do

3783.599 --> 3789.3590000000004
even if you're like successful or

3786.0 --> 3791.7
popular like whatever you do it's going

3789.359 --> 3793.619
to be weaponized against you you are

3791.7 --> 3795.1189999999997
going to be

3793.619 --> 3796.7400000000002
at some point they're going to get a

3795.119 --> 3798.599
grip and they're going to direct you and

3796.74 --> 3802.4399999999996
then you are going to

3798.599 --> 3804.619
get to the designated planned end for

3802.44 --> 3804.619
you

3809.7 --> 3815.9399999999996
Troy their globe

3812.4 --> 3818.28
loser hope vengeance

3815.94 --> 3821.64
really

3818.28 --> 3822.78
but am I that hated by Glovers

3821.64 --> 3826.7599999999998
even

3822.78 --> 3826.76
specifically because of the globe

3826.98 --> 3831.48
I mean

3828.18 --> 3835.0789999999997
I am like a dual cosmogenous I'm for

3831.48 --> 3838.319
dual cosmogonical Society

3835.079 --> 3840.42
I like the globe stories in a way I

3838.319 --> 3843.359
don't like it when they're being used to

3840.42 --> 3845.4
basically make people [ __ ] and

3843.359 --> 3847.44
planting misinformation that's the part

3845.4 --> 3851.539
that I don't like

3847.44 --> 3851.539
but I like the storytelling medium

3878.64 --> 3881.0589999999997
right

3884.22 --> 3888.1189999999997
yeah

3886.079 --> 3891.26
don't know why bothers don't realize

3888.119 --> 3891.26
they are useful idiots

3892.619 --> 3895.98
well they might realize it to some

3895.14 --> 3898.46
extent

3895.98 --> 3898.46
right

3898.799 --> 3904.2
but the real

3901.5 --> 3907.74
defining trait of any idiot is that they

3904.2 --> 3910.74
think they're actually really smart

3907.74 --> 3912.5989999999997
they don't know how to size up the

3910.74 --> 3915.24
complexity level they don't know how to

3912.599 --> 3918.1800000000003
explore the fractal nature of reality

3915.24 --> 3920.339
itself and their abilities

3918.18 --> 3923.339
that's why they're idiots they think oh

3920.339 --> 3925.92
I'm super super better than everybody

3923.339 --> 3929.599
because I I've heard this and I believe

3925.92 --> 3929.599
it and it sounds so smart to me

3930.48 --> 3934.64
and then they make themselves look like

3932.16 --> 3934.64
an idiot

3938.28 --> 3943.98
oh I play a global as a gag better than

3941.46 --> 3946.98
the best yeah but that's because it's no

3943.98 --> 3948.839
but it's not a gag

3946.98 --> 3952.76
it's

3948.839 --> 3952.7599999999998
it's a religious Duty

3956.28 --> 3963.299
I'm just kind of a separatist I'm like

3960.359 --> 3965.64
yeah the globe's a religion

3963.299 --> 3967.02
but it's a religion about storytelling

3965.64 --> 3971.0389999999998
and about

3967.02 --> 3974.88
the Dynamics of your imagination

3971.039 --> 3978.059
and about creating space

3974.88 --> 3981.059
right not just like oh mechanically

3978.059 --> 3982.44
according to the model but also space in

3981.059 --> 3985.6400000000003
your mind

3982.44 --> 3985.64
it is to me

3987.24 --> 3991.6189999999997
a religion that is kind of an

3989.76 --> 3994.619
imagination religion that has kind of

3991.619 --> 3997.26
gone way

3994.619 --> 3999.839
way astray

3997.26 --> 4001.039
and turn in like just a mind control

3999.839 --> 4003.02
tool

4001.039 --> 4004.6400000000003
they weaponized it to just make people

4003.02 --> 4008.319
stupid and trapped in their own

4004.64 --> 4008.319
delusions that they were handed

4008.42 --> 4013.7000000000003
that's how they're using it abusing it

4010.46 --> 4016.76
now I should say it's not using

4013.7 --> 4019.2799999999997
and I have a problem with that

4016.76 --> 4023.6600000000003
because it's not enjoyable

4019.28 --> 4027.52
now like NASA is not enjoyable

4023.66 --> 4031.2799999999997
it's either boring or just straight out

4027.52 --> 4033.619
intellectually insulting

4031.28 --> 4036.8590000000004
you could do other things

4033.619 --> 4038.0
with storytelling mediums right and

4036.859 --> 4039.859
weirdly enough

4038.0 --> 4044.44
yeah that's

4039.859 --> 4044.44
even more recognized like in movies

4048.2 --> 4054.5789999999997
what

4050.079 --> 4054.579
how are you talking about Godzilla

4081.01 --> 4086.5
[Music]

4083.24 --> 4086.5
the hell are you talking about

4092.48 --> 4097.4
um

4093.68 --> 4100.659
by the way I'm eating salt again

4097.4 --> 4100.659
all this fruit stuff

4102.08 --> 4107.5599999999995
not enough salt

4103.819 --> 4107.56
I eat a lot of salt

4107.719 --> 4111.46
like a regular food

4111.62 --> 4118.04
I like salt it's not like I'm burying it

4115.1 --> 4121.54
on the salt but I just like it a lot

4118.04 --> 4121.54
I like things salty

4125.0 --> 4129.199
and pepper

4126.679 --> 4131.839
but yeah

4129.199 --> 4134.48
I'm kind of gonna avoid Pepper for a

4131.839 --> 4137.0199999999995
while if you know what I mean

4134.48 --> 4137.0199999999995
hmm

4147.38 --> 4151.6990000000005
yeah like before the tunnel good point

4149.179 --> 4153.7390000000005
number one factor for Glovers is that

4151.699 --> 4156.5
they don't realize they're useful idiots

4153.739 --> 4158.48
because of their ego right but that's

4156.5 --> 4161.659
why they do it right that's the trick

4158.48 --> 4164.599999999999
they're holding on to it's the

4161.659 --> 4166.5199999999995
doing a magic spell

4164.6 --> 4169.46
and then claiming all these claims about

4166.52 --> 4172.339000000001
it hoping that those you're doing that

4169.46 --> 4175.219
in front are not informed enough or just

4172.339 --> 4178.759
too shy to do anything about it so that

4175.219 --> 4181.94
you can be in that moment in your

4178.759 --> 4184.699
illusion of superiority

4181.94 --> 4186.8589999999995
and the funny thing is guys

4184.699 --> 4189.0199999999995
when I'm Baldwin

4186.859 --> 4192.56
I experienced that

4189.02 --> 4194.780000000001
I literally get a weird like religious

4192.56 --> 4198.56
like

4194.78 --> 4202.54
Euphoria from that it's it's not a joke

4198.56 --> 4202.54
guys it's literally that

4205.88 --> 4210.56
but I don't

4207.8 --> 4213.38
have to really protect my ego as much

4210.56 --> 4215.659000000001
within the process

4213.38 --> 4216.92
right it's much easier to just say like

4215.659 --> 4222.0199999999995
oh

4216.92 --> 4224.42
they hate my my Globe mechanics

4222.02 --> 4226.040000000001
so I'll just be a martyr for my religion

4224.42 --> 4228.32
right if you could just be honest about

4226.04 --> 4230.12
that the globe is a religion then

4228.32 --> 4232.28
there's all kinds of dynamics that are

4230.12 --> 4236.0599999999995
available to you that make it much more

4232.28 --> 4238.28
tolerable to deal with other people

4236.06 --> 4241.159000000001
right because it says I just like these

4238.28 --> 4243.92
stories It's My Religion perhaps I'm

4241.159 --> 4246.679
really fanatic about it right

4243.92 --> 4249.7390000000005
you don't have to act like a complete

4246.679 --> 4251.3
[ __ ] and ruin people's lives if they

4249.739 --> 4252.98
try to snap you out of the dream because

4251.3 --> 4256.900000000001
they don't believe in it

4252.98 --> 4256.9
you don't have to be like that

4296.659 --> 4300.46
hmm

4297.8 --> 4300.46
cool

4300.86 --> 4308.599999999999
PJ CNET I'm just a real big fan of salt

4306.14 --> 4310.159000000001
and it creeps people out even I had it

4308.6 --> 4311.780000000001
as a young kid too

4310.159 --> 4314.239
and there's some places in the world

4311.78 --> 4315.38
where they like really think like you're

4314.239 --> 4317.659
crazy

4315.38 --> 4320.54
to do that

4317.659 --> 4322.719
when I left like this kind of what is it

4320.54 --> 4324.86
what do you call that

4322.719 --> 4328.06
licorice salt

4324.86 --> 4328.0599999999995
it's just a pure

4330.44 --> 4333.5199999999995
oh you call that

4339.38 --> 4344.2390000000005
um you probably know what it is

4341.96 --> 4346.9
but yeah some people think it's really

4344.239 --> 4346.9
disgusting

4347.0 --> 4351.76
but I've always like chucked this stuff

4349.46 --> 4351.76
down

4356.36 --> 4360.5599999999995
and it's weird because some people would

4358.28 --> 4362.78
say oh this is dangerous all that salt

4360.56 --> 4364.46
so dangerous like what the [ __ ] are you

4362.78 --> 4367.94
talking about

4364.46 --> 4370.96
it's great I feel great it makes me feel

4367.94 --> 4370.96
more spirited

4371.659 --> 4376.04
my heart is not troubled by it then

4374.3 --> 4378.820000000001
again I don't have like high blood

4376.04 --> 4378.82
pressure or anything

4380.36 --> 4384.759999999999
hmm

4381.7 --> 4384.76
[Music]

4386.08 --> 4390.76
Licorice and pickles can [ __ ] off okay

4402.92 --> 4405.58
hmm

4414.32 --> 4420.28
okay

4416.179 --> 4420.28
see planting uh

4424.64 --> 4429.1
how Aristotle's needs a flat Earth

4429.92 --> 4434.56
I don't think he necessarily even needed

4432.38 --> 4434.56
it

4437.54 --> 4441.44
was just measuring angles from the

4440.06 --> 4444.52
celestials

4441.44 --> 4444.5199999999995
right so

4447.26 --> 4451.159000000001
like I mean Alba Rooney needed a flat

4449.719 --> 4453.199
Earth even to

4451.159 --> 4455.239
basically

4453.199 --> 4457.58
what was it again

4455.239 --> 4459.98
to size up the height of the mountain he

4457.58 --> 4462.0199999999995
was gonna go up right

4459.98 --> 4465.379999999999
I was talking he's never never did that

4462.02 --> 4467.540000000001
allegedly if he even existed

4465.38 --> 4470.54
he just had a bunch of Wells spread over

4467.54 --> 4473.9
the lands he had some people

4470.54 --> 4477.14
designated there to basically take angle

4473.9 --> 4480.379999999999
measurements in certain dates

4477.14 --> 4482.659000000001
and then reconvene and see the reports

4480.38 --> 4484.88
right that's how he did it right

4482.659 --> 4488.42
like of course he didn't do it just by

4484.88 --> 4490.82
himself yet he would have to have

4488.42 --> 4493.9400000000005
a couple of

4490.82 --> 4496.88
employees slaves whatever

4493.94 --> 4500.599999999999
they would just do the instructions and

4496.88 --> 4504.6990000000005
then they reconvene and size up the data

4500.6 --> 4504.6990000000005
and would be angular data and that's it

4510.44 --> 4515.259999999999
you don't necessarily need a flat plane

4512.9 --> 4515.259999999999
for that

4516.32 --> 4520.699
but it doesn't prove a globe either just

4519.26 --> 4524.179
because there is an angle difference

4520.699 --> 4526.099999999999
over diff yeah distance right it's all

4524.179 --> 4530.4400000000005
about presupposition that's the only

4526.1 --> 4530.4400000000005
thing that can really happen in there

4532.52 --> 4537.4400000000005
tenth measure and angle

4534.62 --> 4539.98
an angle to the horizon

4537.44 --> 4539.98
right

4548.06 --> 4550.54
what

4561.98 --> 4564.699
what

4571.4 --> 4577.839999999999
okay Kai from Gore and I don't

4574.52 --> 4577.84
understand what you're saying

4584.54 --> 4588.679
and it was assumed all solar rays are

4586.94 --> 4591.139999999999
apparently right well seeking Star Wars

4588.679 --> 4594.679
yes I already tried to Enlighten that

4591.14 --> 4597.280000000001
could have been more detailed sorry

4594.679 --> 4600.32
yeah the whole model

4597.28 --> 4602.54
becomes presupposed after

4600.32 --> 4605.599999999999
what what I said it's just angular data

4602.54 --> 4606.679
it's like oh so there that angle that

4605.6 --> 4610.400000000001
time

4606.679 --> 4612.8
of that date and that's it that's really

4610.4 --> 4614.839999999999
all right

4612.8 --> 4617.0
and I guess that yeah if you're going to

4614.84 --> 4619.159000000001
take an angle of the sun like which

4617.0 --> 4622.12
would be very similar to when you what

4619.159 --> 4622.12
you do with the sexton

4622.28 --> 4625.599999999999
towards the horizon

4626.42 --> 4632.4800000000005
yeah you are going to have a have to

4630.56 --> 4634.400000000001
need a flat plane in order to get that

4632.48 --> 4636.678999999999
consistent

4634.4 --> 4638.42
right otherwise that would constantly

4636.679 --> 4641.659
change

4638.42 --> 4644.62
if you if you change your height

4641.659 --> 4644.62
like even a bit

4645.02 --> 4650.38
so there's that

4647.06 --> 4650.38
it's an old song oh okay

4665.0 --> 4668.86
how did they sync the time

4673.219 --> 4676.719
um

4673.94 --> 4676.719
well

4677.719 --> 4683.6
using the calendar right how do you know

4680.54 --> 4685.64
what time it is in one region and in

4683.6 --> 4688.159000000001
another based on

4685.64 --> 4691.1
recorded accounts

4688.159 --> 4694.699
so there was a calendar like in like how

4691.1 --> 4696.7390000000005
it is and then they use that

4694.699 --> 4699.08
to basically go apart take the

4696.739 --> 4701.419999999999
measurements based on like where it is

4699.08 --> 4703.64
everything

4701.42 --> 4706.28
according to the time basic what do you

4703.64 --> 4707.54
call this a sundial

4706.28 --> 4710.179
time

4707.54 --> 4711.5
and then the right date and just record

4710.179 --> 4714.56
the angle

4711.5 --> 4716.6
separate from using the sundial

4714.56 --> 4718.280000000001
and then you just have that angular data

4716.6 --> 4720.38
that's how they did it

4718.28 --> 4722.179
oh thank you Godzilla for the 10

4720.38 --> 4724.46
Canadian dollar Super Chat donation

4722.179 --> 4727.219
Happy Easter

4724.46 --> 4729.64
is it Easter yeah it might be Easter

4727.219 --> 4729.64
cool

4737.12 --> 4742.5199999999995
like before it can open going on fed I

4740.42 --> 4746.0
don't know

4742.52 --> 4750.580000000001
I haven't heard much about Kent Hoven

4746.0 --> 4750.58
since that moment like before the tunnel

4757.64 --> 4762.4400000000005
all right sandals only yeah I know

4759.86 --> 4765.0199999999995
seeking Star Wars everything only works

4762.44 --> 4766.879999999999
on a flat surface

4765.02 --> 4768.88
and that sounds exaggerated but it is

4766.88 --> 4773.02
kind of true though like pretty much

4768.88 --> 4773.02
nothing would work on the globe

4776.239 --> 4782.178999999999
you couldn't see far you couldn't use

4779.36 --> 4784.94
radio signals nothing nothing works on

4782.179 --> 4787.6990000000005
the globe like everything sucks on the

4784.94 --> 4790.78
globe really if it was really a globe

4787.699 --> 4790.78
because nothing works

4806.239 --> 4810.459999999999
what about a cone what do you mean

4814.34 --> 4820.76
it is flat now what the entire terrain

4817.88 --> 4824.4400000000005
is comprised of spatially

4820.76 --> 4827.06
we don't know yet some say it is a disc

4824.44 --> 4829.4
covered by a dome

4827.06 --> 4831.820000000001
but I don't see that as the only viable

4829.4 --> 4831.82
option

4919.639 --> 4922.36
foreign

4943.46 --> 4946.659
not thinking about that

4951.86 --> 4957.139
it is on a lot of people's minds it

4954.62 --> 4959.42
seems though out there

4957.139 --> 4962.8
for her like some mom promising her

4959.42 --> 4962.8
little kids some ice cream

4965.06 --> 4968.38
when I went out for groceries

4976.4 --> 4978.58
foreign

5043.199 --> 5049.98
okay right back well akumo is

5047.139 --> 5049.9800000000005
kind of both

5051.04 --> 5055.44
I mean he's not a genius by a long shot

5056.38 --> 5059.639
he gets bogged down

5062.26 --> 5068.56
but yeah there's some things that he can

5065.26 --> 5071.02
get a bit good at sometimes but it's

5068.56 --> 5072.639
just only when he's just frolicking

5071.02 --> 5075.159000000001
around like as soon as you hold into

5072.639 --> 5077.56
account it just breaks

5075.159 --> 5081.04
it just starts to break apart and become

5077.56 --> 5081.04
like superfluous

5122.62 --> 5127.659
okay so you can start with it but isn't

5125.02 --> 5132.0
technically being slow

5127.659 --> 5136.179
doesn't that include just

5132.0 --> 5140.1
willfully overlooking things

5136.179 --> 5140.1
that seems very slow to me

5167.01 --> 5170.169
[Music]

5171.34 --> 5175.56
what are you talking about

5178.84 --> 5183.659000000001
a flat plane flat with Edo

5183.88 --> 5191.219
no it's flat Cliff Santos it's just flat

5187.0 --> 5191.219
that's the aspect that we do know

5192.28 --> 5198.42
what the exact confines are are just not

5196.06 --> 5198.42
known

5199.96 --> 5205.9
we don't know exactly what

5202.9 --> 5208.36
the container is

5205.9 --> 5210.659
we just know it has to have a limited

5208.36 --> 5210.659
volume

5212.44 --> 5217.9
and it has to be contained like it's not

5216.699 --> 5219.759999999999
open

5217.9 --> 5221.799999999999
because that's physically impossible

5219.76 --> 5224.34
it's like a lot of thermodynamics

5221.8 --> 5224.34
violation

5266.86 --> 5269.46
hmm

5270.6 --> 5274.84
yeah I saw that

5272.86 --> 5277.62
George Sanford

5274.84 --> 5277.62
weird

5301.6 --> 5306.58
I didn't even understand the point

5304.36 --> 5309.639
of that model

5306.58 --> 5311.679
solar system with a huge bubble like

5309.639 --> 5314.1990000000005
I don't understand the point they were

5311.679 --> 5318.36
even trying to make

5314.199 --> 5318.36
with that it was just weird

5324.82 --> 5330.699
I guess they were attempting to catalog

5327.82 --> 5333.46
like a a gas pressure gradient system

5330.699 --> 5335.62
for the Galaxy so I don't know maybe

5333.46 --> 5338.32
they are going for a

5335.62 --> 5340.54
a change in the model into an outer gas

5338.32 --> 5342.04
universe and that it's actually not a

5340.54 --> 5346.659
perfect vacuum and now they're gonna

5342.04 --> 5351.239
size up like how the gases are divided

5346.659 --> 5351.239
maybe that's their new thing now

5353.5 --> 5356.159
it could be

5371.08 --> 5376.48
you believe they are correct what

5374.56 --> 5378.84
George Sanford what the hell are you

5376.48 --> 5378.839999999999
talking about

5383.739 --> 5387.48
I didn't know you were a glober

5390.04 --> 5394.32
how can you just say they are correct

5400.36 --> 5406.799999999999
we are inside what the hell does that

5403.06 --> 5406.8
have to do with the heliocentric model

5421.659 --> 5428.5
and a big bubble well we are in a

5425.679 --> 5431.26
limited volume space that is available

5428.5 --> 5432.46
to us now whether that is in the form in

5431.26 --> 5435.42
the shape

5432.46 --> 5435.42
of a bubble

5436.36 --> 5441.78
or a box

5438.179 --> 5441.78
looping whatever

5441.84 --> 5448.54
like yeah why do you think that they

5446.199 --> 5450.719
that they are giving you the answer to

5448.54 --> 5450.719
that

5453.52 --> 5460.120000000001
I mean the the most logical thing you

5457.12 --> 5462.04
could get out of it is like oh it's

5460.12 --> 5464.92
it's a container

5462.04 --> 5466.48
they're trying to create a container in

5464.92 --> 5469.1990000000005
space

5466.48 --> 5469.199
that's it

5526.659 --> 5533.259999999999
could be snow globe sure

5530.02 --> 5535.860000000001
look Matthew yeah I'm I'm not saying

5533.26 --> 5538.360000000001
that it is absolutely

5535.86 --> 5541.5599999999995
excluded that we're inside of a glass

5538.36 --> 5541.5599999999995
bubble or something

5541.659 --> 5545.739
I'm just saying

5543.699 --> 5549.879999999999
we don't know

5545.739 --> 5552.58
and I don't see it as like a

5549.88 --> 5554.92
like it has to be that

5552.58 --> 5557.82
because I think that yeah

5554.92 --> 5560.5
it's already based on sort of form of

5557.82 --> 5562.719
physicality assumption bias like it has

5560.5 --> 5565.42
to be just like an object that we can

5562.719 --> 5569.34
make like uh no we're talking about

5565.42 --> 5569.34
physical existence

5570.52 --> 5575.080000000001
right

5572.08 --> 5577.0
who says it has to be some sort of

5575.08 --> 5579.4
typical

5577.0 --> 5581.02
like architectural

5579.4 --> 5584.5599999999995
system

5581.02 --> 5586.96
a space based on an architecture if it

5584.56 --> 5591.06
is like the the very

5586.96 --> 5591.06
existence of physicality

5593.199 --> 5598.48
that is being manifested right why would

5595.78 --> 5601.78
it need why would the the very space of

5598.48 --> 5605.199
physical existence in itself need

5601.78 --> 5608.98
a typical architecture that we would

5605.199 --> 5612.4
make within it why

5608.98 --> 5614.919999999999
does it have to support the nothing the

5612.4 --> 5618.9
literal non-physical existence outside

5614.92 --> 5618.9
of it in any way no

5619.0 --> 5623.82
then why would it have to have like a

5621.159 --> 5627.759999999999
dome shape because of its architectural

5623.82 --> 5630.9
soundness bye

5627.76 --> 5634.06
it doesn't it could literally be

5630.9 --> 5636.638999999999
rectangular or irregular looping and

5634.06 --> 5638.26
it's literally just

5636.639 --> 5641.139
a space

5638.26 --> 5643.42
without barriers that's just looping in

5641.139 --> 5645.6990000000005
on itself

5643.42 --> 5648.34
and you'd never even figure out like

5645.699 --> 5651.339999999999
there is no barriers like there would

5648.34 --> 5654.219
effectively be no barriers

5651.34 --> 5655.900000000001
you would just end up in the same spot

5654.219 --> 5657.639
and then the global starts squirting

5655.9 --> 5660.219
again like oh that's only possible

5657.639 --> 5663.04
because you're on a globe you walked

5660.219 --> 5665.76
over to the other side yeah yeah or it's

5663.04 --> 5665.76
just looping

5674.92 --> 5680.4400000000005
right and then the ultimate question

5677.92 --> 5683.86
comes if that is the case then there is

5680.44 --> 5687.159
no barriers at all like any at all

5683.86 --> 5691.839999999999
not energy nothing no

5687.159 --> 5695.44
spatial limitation to go sideways

5691.84 --> 5697.119000000001
north south east or west never like you

5695.44 --> 5699.339999999999
could literally always keep on going

5697.119 --> 5701.5599999999995
even though it is flat

5699.34 --> 5704.9400000000005
well what is going to be

5701.56 --> 5704.9400000000005
the top barrier then

5706.54 --> 5712.54
in that sort of presuppositional setup

5709.36 --> 5716.44
like in that sort of mechanical setup

5712.54 --> 5719.679
well it could be literally that

5716.44 --> 5722.379999999999
the top of our realm is the bottom of

5719.679 --> 5725.619
our realm that it Loops vertically as

5722.38 --> 5728.56
well that we're literally contained by

5725.619 --> 5729.759999999999
the bottom side of the matter available

5728.56 --> 5733.56
here

5729.76 --> 5733.56
that that is the barrier

5735.46 --> 5740.5
it would be like a big chunk

5738.82 --> 5741.58
and we're standing on the top of that

5740.5 --> 5744.4
chunk

5741.58 --> 5746.699
and we're staring at the bottom of that

5744.4 --> 5746.699
chunk

5747.46 --> 5756.54
could be right then there is no physical

5751.06 --> 5756.54
barrier at all there's only looping

5789.52 --> 5792.0
hmm

5802.179 --> 5807.9
the only way out is out of body well

5805.239 --> 5807.9
it's funny because

5808.659 --> 5813.699
yeah perhaps

5811.239 --> 5815.08
perhaps like the body yeah if you're

5813.699 --> 5817.719
just spirit

5815.08 --> 5820.0599999999995
then you could potentially move outside

5817.719 --> 5822.52
of the loop

5820.06 --> 5827.159000000001
of the physical existence

5822.52 --> 5827.159000000001
outside of that space But then what

5827.619 --> 5832.36
I mean everything else that would be

5830.08 --> 5835.48
Beyond it

5832.36 --> 5839.38
is either a pure construct of spiritual

5835.48 --> 5841.678999999999
nature basically a projection

5839.38 --> 5844.3
of this period itself

5841.679 --> 5846.159
potentially seemingly creating whatever

5844.3 --> 5850.02
they want there

5846.159 --> 5850.0199999999995
might have some collective effect

5850.659 --> 5856.44
or there would simply be absolutely

5852.94 --> 5856.44
nothing only avoid

5857.5 --> 5861.82
right but whatever is there it's going

5860.199 --> 5864.638999999999
to be

5861.82 --> 5868.0599999999995
an internal reflection based on the

5864.639 --> 5871.0
experiences of the Physical Realm

5868.06 --> 5873.820000000001
like we wouldn't even be projecting

5871.0 --> 5876.4
anything out there

5873.82 --> 5878.92
at all if we didn't have a physical body

5876.4 --> 5883.0599999999995
experience

5878.92 --> 5888.9
that's how we understand what landscape

5883.06 --> 5888.900000000001
is what natural is what beauty is

5889.719 --> 5893.56
we all get it here from the material

5891.699 --> 5897.5199999999995
Realm

5893.56 --> 5902.52
that's how we envision Things based on

5897.52 --> 5902.52
reflections of everything that is here

5902.56 --> 5907.360000000001
so that's why I say like even in the

5905.38 --> 5910.179
spiritual realm right oh Out of Body

5907.36 --> 5912.759999999999
Experience or lose energetics

5910.179 --> 5914.7390000000005
that's cute you can't

5912.76 --> 5917.52
stay there

5914.739 --> 5919.9
because it is only

5917.52 --> 5922.42
effectively there because there is a

5919.9 --> 5925.719
material experience we could never move

5922.42 --> 5928.2390000000005
like into the spirit realm abandoning

5925.719 --> 5933.119
the Earthly Realm

5928.239 --> 5933.119
like entirely with nothing going back

5934.06 --> 5939.06
because what would we become

5936.46 --> 5939.06
nothing

5939.28 --> 5942.48
there wouldn't be anything

5950.92 --> 5957.1
I mean there might be infinite potential

5953.88 --> 5960.9400000000005
yeah but nothing

5957.1 --> 5963.4800000000005
infinite potential no meaning

5960.94 --> 5963.48
nothing

5973.42 --> 5980.1990000000005
I have

5976.42 --> 5982.54
why the need for physical anything

5980.199 --> 5986.678999999999
because that is what our very

5982.54 --> 5990.36
Consciousness uses as a foundation

5986.679 --> 5990.36
for its own existence

5991.96 --> 5996.76
we have thoughts and dreams and

5994.719 --> 5998.619
everything based on physical

5996.76 --> 6000.3
interactions

5998.619 --> 6003.239
on substance

6000.3 --> 6008.0
everything even the metaphorical things

6003.239 --> 6010.678999999999
are all based on physical things

6008.0 --> 6013.08
they understand that all the spiritual

6010.679 --> 6014.82
mechanics

6013.08 --> 6017.699
fractal their structure they're a

6014.82 --> 6021.78
pattern but they can only even manifest

6017.699 --> 6024.54
because there is original foundations of

6021.78 --> 6028.5
physical like interaction experiences in

6024.54 --> 6030.619
order to fill in the fractal pattern you

6028.5 --> 6030.619
see

6041.82 --> 6048.239
and it is with fractal thinking the

6045.54 --> 6051.179
physical experience commonality

6048.239 --> 6054.48
that makes it universally compatible

6051.179 --> 6056.159
because everybody lives in the same

6054.48 --> 6059.5199999999995
Realm

6056.159 --> 6062.759999999999
made by the same God with the same rules

6059.52 --> 6065.280000000001
and the same type of experiences no

6062.76 --> 6066.84
matter how special and unique some want

6065.28 --> 6069.179
to be and then they spend their entire

6066.84 --> 6071.219
life trying to make

6069.179 --> 6073.86
make it clear that they are different

6071.219 --> 6076.26
yeah yeah

6073.86 --> 6079.5
but those that don't really want to be

6076.26 --> 6081.900000000001
special and separate necessarily not the

6079.5 --> 6084.36
opposite either just want to figure out

6081.9 --> 6087.0599999999995
what's what

6084.36 --> 6089.88
they when they read a book they reflect

6087.06 --> 6091.92
it upon their own things and dreams and

6089.88 --> 6095.04
experience and maybe even past lives at

6091.92 --> 6097.139
experiences right all reflecting on some

6095.04 --> 6099.619
kind of material interaction based

6097.139 --> 6099.619
experience

6102.36 --> 6111.08
and our emotions and conflicts social

6106.56 --> 6111.080000000001
interactions in between all that

6122.34 --> 6128.78
the physical could be the projection of

6125.52 --> 6128.780000000001
the spiritual though no

6131.4 --> 6134.239
no it's not

6143.28 --> 6148.44
yeah that's again I think that that is

6146.04 --> 6152.28
like spiritual nepotism

6148.44 --> 6154.379999999999
or a solipsism sorry nepotism it's

6152.28 --> 6157.5599999999995
spiritual solipsism to think that the

6154.38 --> 6160.32
spirit is the primary it isn't it's the

6157.56 --> 6161.820000000001
most important factor of our existence

6160.32 --> 6163.38
for sure

6161.82 --> 6165.98
right

6163.38 --> 6165.9800000000005
it is

6167.28 --> 6169.759999999999
but

6169.8 --> 6176.639
if there was literally no material

6173.28 --> 6180.179
at all or Physical Realm anything

6176.639 --> 6181.02
we can't imagine what a spirit would be

6180.179 --> 6183.42
like

6181.02 --> 6185.820000000001
if there wasn't all this

6183.42 --> 6189.2390000000005
because everything we dream everything

6185.82 --> 6191.4
we think of everything is a reflection

6189.239 --> 6194.159
of the material Realm

6191.4 --> 6196.739
in a direct or indirect way

6194.159 --> 6198.54
and even like the social interactions in

6196.739 --> 6201.0
like the unique feeling based

6198.54 --> 6204.5
experiences that are very hard to

6201.0 --> 6207.119
describe are always

6204.5 --> 6208.76
somehow accompanied mechanically

6207.119 --> 6212.96
visually

6208.76 --> 6216.659000000001
by physical situations

6212.96 --> 6219.42
separated people

6216.659 --> 6221.638999999999
all these traits are all because of the

6219.42 --> 6224.1
physical material Realm

6221.639 --> 6227.1
that there it's the palette the material

6224.1 --> 6230.1
realm is the palette for the spirit to

6227.1 --> 6232.4400000000005
manifest again right the pattern is

6230.1 --> 6234.659000000001
there the structure is there but how it

6232.44 --> 6237.119
is filled in

6234.659 --> 6239.46
it's filled in with all the reflections

6237.119 --> 6241.32
of the material and that's just how it

6239.46 --> 6244.699
works

6241.32 --> 6244.699
it's only logical

6248.639 --> 6255.8
the Physical Realm is the palette

6251.699 --> 6255.799999999999
for our Spirits painting

6262.139 --> 6267.659000000001
I hope that makes sense to you

6265.02 --> 6270.860000000001
it might also give you a headache it is

6267.659 --> 6270.86
extremely introspective

6272.42 --> 6277.219
I'm basically

6274.98 --> 6280.04
trying to like

6277.219 --> 6284.76
pharmaceutically

6280.04 --> 6288.0
or say uh distill like very Spirit

6284.76 --> 6291.0
mechanics in itself like this is like

6288.0 --> 6293.159
some heavy [ __ ] this is like Pillars of

6291.0 --> 6295.02
Creation and like separating them like

6293.159 --> 6297.96
yeah

6295.02 --> 6300.38
this everything that's there it's it's

6297.96 --> 6305.34
super important the spirit but it's only

6300.38 --> 6308.52
what it is because the paint

6305.34 --> 6312.3
off the material realm in a way the

6308.52 --> 6315.080000000001
spirit almost like seeks to abandon like

6312.3 --> 6317.820000000001
the harshness and the

6315.08 --> 6320.639
purposelessness and the chaos seeming

6317.82 --> 6324.179
chaos of the material Realm but

6320.639 --> 6325.679
everything it is is a reflection of it

6324.179 --> 6328.26
everything

6325.679 --> 6330.84
like the individual doesn't even exist

6328.26 --> 6333.659000000001
without the material Realm

6330.84 --> 6335.96
as an individual as like a separate

6333.659 --> 6335.96
spirit

6340.38 --> 6345.1990000000005
the way these are the conversations I

6342.239 --> 6345.199
live okay good to hear

6346.8 --> 6355.88
I'm getting a bit of a headache

6350.159 --> 6355.879999999999
uh no I'm actually doing quite good but

6356.04 --> 6358.1
um

6359.58 --> 6363.139
maybe a bit too much salt

6363.48 --> 6370.759999999999
it's weird man my entire metabolism has

6366.36 --> 6370.759999999999
just kind of changed since I got this

6371.04 --> 6376.94
I can pretty much only eat half of

6374.34 --> 6376.9400000000005
everything now

6377.219 --> 6382.8
it's really odd because I do have like

6380.28 --> 6385.259999999999
hunger like but then I eat something

6382.8 --> 6387.119000000001
it's like no I literally can't finish

6385.26 --> 6390.08
this

6387.119 --> 6390.08
really weird

6402.96 --> 6406.08
I don't see the physically it's the

6405.119 --> 6408.0
basement

6406.08 --> 6410.48
yeah but that's your spirit

6408.0 --> 6410.48
right

6411.3 --> 6416.179
I mean can you imagine

6413.46 --> 6416.179
a house

6416.52 --> 6423.360000000001
without that basement

6418.38 --> 6426.6
right look the word you used a basement

6423.36 --> 6430.38
is a Physical Realm conception your

6426.6 --> 6433.38
metaphor that you gave to me is based

6430.38 --> 6434.76
on a physical property in the Physical

6433.38 --> 6438.32
Realm

6434.76 --> 6438.320000000001
right that was part of my point

6443.25 --> 6446.39
[Music]

6456.06 --> 6461.580000000001
and I'm not telling you like oh blessed

6458.94 --> 6464.5199999999995
be the physicality no there's challenges

6461.58 --> 6467.9
it's harsh it sucks

6464.52 --> 6467.900000000001
dude I am

6468.42 --> 6471.1990000000005
yeah

6471.239 --> 6476.0599999999995
a lot of the times I'm not a big fan of

6473.52 --> 6476.06
this realm

6476.4 --> 6480.239
I guess I'm just not off this world I'm

6478.8 --> 6482.639
just in it

6480.239 --> 6486.0
but

6482.639 --> 6488.46
just as a mechanical logic almost like a

6486.0 --> 6491.04
computer I'm analyzing Spirit mechanics

6488.46 --> 6494.84
like a computer I'm analyzing

6491.04 --> 6497.699
very Consciousness itself and the spirit

6494.84 --> 6499.8
like a computer and I'm coming to the

6497.699 --> 6502.678999999999
conclusion everything that happens in

6499.8 --> 6507.2390000000005
the spirit in some way director indirect

6502.679 --> 6509.4
is based on material experiences and

6507.239 --> 6511.98
that could even be like even if you have

6509.4 --> 6514.799999999999
some kind of like Euphoria gland thing

6511.98 --> 6518.5199999999995
happen in your head gives you like oh

6514.8 --> 6520.320000000001
and accompanied by the ideas those are

6518.52 --> 6522.659000000001
the moments sometimes right those are

6520.32 --> 6525.659
the moments of your life well guess what

6522.659 --> 6528.119
how could that exist without your

6525.659 --> 6530.28
physical body how could you dwell upon

6528.119 --> 6533.159
an experience

6530.28 --> 6536.54
without the physical aspects

6533.159 --> 6536.54
making that possible

6537.239 --> 6542.879999999999
everything

6539.04 --> 6545.46
that our Spirits does is all based on

6542.88 --> 6547.619
reflections of things that happen in the

6545.46 --> 6550.159
material Realm

6547.619 --> 6550.159
everything

6550.5 --> 6555.619
the very language of our thinking

6555.86 --> 6564.0199999999995
and our internal dreams are all

6559.739 --> 6564.0199999999995
reflections of the material Realm

6564.9 --> 6569.58
that's my point

6566.639 --> 6571.4400000000005
right this is not about oh what's the

6569.58 --> 6575.4
purpose oh what does it mean no it's

6571.44 --> 6578.239
just like a very mechanical analysis I'm

6575.4 --> 6578.239
trying to do here

6580.02 --> 6584.400000000001
do you think dreams need a Physical

6582.119 --> 6586.32
Realm to exist

6584.4 --> 6587.699
well what the hell would you be dreaming

6586.32 --> 6589.799999999999
about

6587.699 --> 6592.138999999999
break back

6589.8 --> 6597.08
what are you dreaming about

6592.139 --> 6600.36
then if not about some representation or

6597.08 --> 6604.5
alteration of a Physical Realm

6600.36 --> 6607.98
experience a location a couple of people

6604.5 --> 6611.119
right like to alter it happens a lot but

6607.98 --> 6616.459999999999
it's still based on

6611.119 --> 6616.46
experiences in the Physical Realm

6628.199 --> 6633.78
how are you determining which is the

6630.84 --> 6637.04
reflection is what I'm getting at

6633.78 --> 6637.04
that makes no sense

6645.239 --> 6651.299999999999
I mean there are weird elements though

6648.78 --> 6653.58
like How could somebody Envision

6651.3 --> 6656.400000000001
something extremely unusual that's never

6653.58 --> 6660.139
been seen by him

6656.4 --> 6660.138999999999
and then design and make it

6663.0 --> 6667.38
10.

6664.8 --> 6669.900000000001
the spirit

6667.38 --> 6671.52
yeah but that's I don't need to ask I

6669.9 --> 6674.0599999999995
can explain that actually the spirit

6671.52 --> 6674.06
does

6674.82 --> 6682.0199999999995
Envision things outside of the physical

6677.96 --> 6684.2390000000005
about the physical but why

6682.02 --> 6687.5
because there was a physical to reflect

6684.239 --> 6687.5
upon in the first place

6687.599 --> 6693.38
how would you come up with an

6689.28 --> 6693.38
architecture idea of anything

6693.96 --> 6702.42
if you didn't have material experiences

6697.32 --> 6704.5199999999995
to base that Vision on you see

6702.42 --> 6708.1990000000005
the building blocks were there they were

6704.52 --> 6708.1990000000005
reflections of the material Realm

6717.17 --> 6720.279
[Music]

6724.92 --> 6729.9
but you've had experience that weren't

6726.84 --> 6732.599
through this realm

6729.9 --> 6735.598999999999
uh yeah that's right

6732.599 --> 6737.82
the Dark World Visions I have indeed but

6735.599 --> 6739.26
guess what everything I remember about

6737.82 --> 6741.42
that

6739.26 --> 6743.04
all had

6741.42 --> 6746.719
visual

6743.04 --> 6748.38
auditory and sensory

6746.719 --> 6751.08
experiences

6748.38 --> 6753.4800000000005
right it's all it was mostly like

6751.08 --> 6756.48
simulatory it was like a Holodeck right

6753.48 --> 6759.48
but it was all based on conceptions

6756.48 --> 6761.339999999999
based in the Physical Realm it were all

6759.48 --> 6763.5
things I could compare with all of most

6761.34 --> 6768.78
of it was metaphorical

6763.5 --> 6771.36
even all metaphors are reflections of

6768.78 --> 6775.38
the Physical Realm

6771.36 --> 6778.08
I mean hello it's right there

6775.38 --> 6782.76
metaphors they work so great

6778.08 --> 6787.099
all of them all of them are based

6782.76 --> 6787.099
on Physical Realm things

6796.199 --> 6798.678999999999
right

6804.239 --> 6809.759999999999
the spirit's really easy to do that

6806.94 --> 6812.219
second nature is what the spirit does is

6809.76 --> 6814.5
reflect upon the Physical Realm that's

6812.219 --> 6816.599
why a metaphor works so well a lot of

6814.5 --> 6820.34
the time

6816.599 --> 6820.34
because your spirit can easily

6820.56 --> 6827.2390000000005
visualize the typical object or whatever

6823.98 --> 6831.0
is being used in the metaphor

6827.239 --> 6833.098999999999
draw out the situation with it in their

6831.0 --> 6835.32
mind and then compare it and be like

6833.099 --> 6837.2390000000005
yeah yeah it works

6835.32 --> 6839.34
why

6837.239 --> 6842.638999999999
because the spirit's really good at

6839.34 --> 6843.900000000001
reflecting upon the material realm its

6842.639 --> 6847.1990000000005
entire

6843.9 --> 6851.179
spectrum of existence is based upon

6847.199 --> 6851.178999999999
reflecting upon the material Realm

6856.38 --> 6860.639
right and I don't mean your conscious

6858.54 --> 6864.06
Focus necessarily right I'm not meaning

6860.639 --> 6866.82
like pay attention to every detail like

6864.06 --> 6870.84
some hyper stoned person or something no

6866.82 --> 6874.139
I'm talking about what just happens

6870.84 --> 6876.360000000001
it is like hyper analysis in a way not

6874.139 --> 6878.9400000000005
telling you like oh do that oh yeah get

6876.36 --> 6881.639
into what I'm talking about and it's see

6878.94 --> 6885.0
it just see it just see the Matrix well

6881.639 --> 6888.06
you could try that but

6885.0 --> 6890.94
I'm just trying to make a point making a

6888.06 --> 6893.820000000001
philosophical Point more than anything

6890.94 --> 6896.9
this is just like ontological

6893.82 --> 6896.9
primitive stuff

6897.0 --> 6901.86
everything that we experience through

6899.34 --> 6905.159000000001
our Consciousness and our spirit

6901.86 --> 6908.4
in her dreams in every surreal place all

6905.159 --> 6910.679
of it is somehow a reflection of

6908.4 --> 6912.239
material experiences

6910.679 --> 6914.9400000000005
all of it

6912.239 --> 6916.199
there is no experience without it not a

6914.94 --> 6919.0199999999995
single one

6916.199 --> 6921.9
it's always like could be it you could

6919.02 --> 6924.3
say anything imaginable and it would

6921.9 --> 6926.879999999999
always be able to tie in a physical

6924.3 --> 6928.7390000000005
reflection right you could be in a dark

6926.88 --> 6931.219
experience but still everything happened

6928.739 --> 6933.718999999999
oh could it be because you were feeling

6931.219 --> 6936.7390000000005
feelings things that happen internally

6933.719 --> 6936.7390000000005
in your body

6937.199 --> 6942.419999999999
which is a physical experience

6940.199 --> 6947.58
that it is comprised of and not just

6942.42 --> 6950.58
audio visual right yeah no it's all a

6947.58 --> 6952.98
reflection of material experiences every

6950.58 --> 6955.5
single thing our Consciousness is

6952.98 --> 6957.48
presented with at every Point throughout

6955.5 --> 6961.08
our life until death

6957.48 --> 6963.178999999999
no exception ever

6961.08 --> 6965.4
everything is a reflection of material

6963.179 --> 6968.76
realm in our spirit everything no

6965.4 --> 6970.86
exception zero

6968.76 --> 6973.9800000000005
and we're becoming more adamant about

6970.86 --> 6976.92
this it is true it is an ontological

6973.98 --> 6978.78
primitive it is logical it cannot be

6976.92 --> 6982.9400000000005
another way

6978.78 --> 6982.94
you couldn't even attempt

6983.04 --> 6987.36
to explain it outside of it

6986.28 --> 6990.239
like

6987.36 --> 6992.4
explain to me something that's not a

6990.239 --> 6993.9
reflection of the material realm in some

6992.4 --> 6998.82
way try

6993.9 --> 7002.598999999999
oh oh yeah you can't use the language

6998.82 --> 7008.599
to explain something outside of the

7002.599 --> 7012.139
language oh yeah surprise surprise yeah

7008.599 --> 7014.619000000001
no not a surprise actually it's dead on

7012.139 --> 7014.619
logical

7020.239 --> 7025.5199999999995
sound smell thought no but our thoughts

7022.94 --> 7027.32
is the same

7025.52 --> 7029.360000000001
thoughts

7027.32 --> 7033.199
what goes on in their mind in our

7029.36 --> 7035.839999999999
simulator is still a reflection of the

7033.199 --> 7038.0599999999995
material Realm

7035.84 --> 7041.119000000001
everything about it

7038.06 --> 7043.400000000001
it might have been very out of context

7041.119 --> 7045.619
and like oh it's separate oh this is a

7043.4 --> 7049.179
magical right

7045.619 --> 7053.659
but those conceptions are still

7049.179 --> 7057.159
derived from the material realm

7053.659 --> 7059.78
everything is everything all the ideas

7057.159 --> 7062.659
everything that dwells in her head no

7059.78 --> 7064.099
exception it all comes from Material

7062.659 --> 7066.5599999999995
Realm

7064.099 --> 7069.8
everything

7066.56 --> 7073.639
and yeah you might say well where is it

7069.8 --> 7075.8
coming from then how could these kids

7073.639 --> 7077.96
have all this magical thing in their

7075.8 --> 7080.96
mind and they draw it out and like oh

7077.96 --> 7082.639
that's amazing yeah well

7080.96 --> 7085.28
I'm

7082.639 --> 7087.32
not surprised about that like the spirit

7085.28 --> 7090.08
has quite is quite magical can

7087.32 --> 7093.28
potentially reach outside a Time

7090.08 --> 7093.28
especially as a kid

7093.98 --> 7098.839999999999
but as it does that

7096.32 --> 7102.799999999999
what is basically doing then is

7098.84 --> 7104.96
reflecting upon the material Realm

7102.8 --> 7108.4400000000005
through another time

7104.96 --> 7110.84
or maybe through an individual

7108.44 --> 7115.119
that they might have been before that

7110.84 --> 7115.119000000001
right reincarnation I'm up for that

7122.719 --> 7128.3
denying that sound what

7125.239 --> 7130.04
no but sound waves only exist because of

7128.3 --> 7132.5
the material Realm

7130.04 --> 7135.139
sound waves are literally the

7132.5 --> 7139.28
displacement of matter

7135.139 --> 7142.76
in a very specific type of pattern

7139.28 --> 7145.099
yeah without matter without the material

7142.76 --> 7147.56
realm there is no sound there is no

7145.099 --> 7151.400000000001
vibration it's something that only

7147.56 --> 7155.38
exists in the material Realm

7151.4 --> 7155.379999999999
or in the simulator of your mind

7168.78 --> 7173.0
[Music]

7170.9 --> 7175.699
right

7173.0 --> 7179.06
but yeah then what does this all turn

7175.699 --> 7182.119
into right like oh are our spirits

7179.06 --> 7184.580000000001
then oh we are actually just material

7182.119 --> 7186.799999999999
this period is just a reflection of the

7184.58 --> 7190.159
material no that's not what I'm saying

7186.8 --> 7194.54
I'm just saying that

7190.159 --> 7197.619
that's the ground it's born on

7194.54 --> 7197.619
it can only

7197.659 --> 7202.4
do things in reflection of the material

7200.599 --> 7205.719
Realm

7202.4 --> 7211.098999999999
like that's the purpose of it by Design

7205.719 --> 7214.46
to do that it's the only thing it can do

7211.099 --> 7217.159000000001
right but yeah the spirit can cross

7214.46 --> 7219.38
amazing boundaries Through Time

7217.159 --> 7221.96
and there could be all kinds of things

7219.38 --> 7224.96
that like even the collective Spirits

7221.96 --> 7227.9
together like a spirit pool could do

7224.96 --> 7231.44
outside of the material realm but guess

7227.9 --> 7234.138999999999
what everything that is going to happen

7231.44 --> 7236.839999999999
like that and that is going to be done

7234.139 --> 7237.86
by spirits that seems quite surreal like

7236.84 --> 7242.3
that

7237.86 --> 7245.36
still gonna be based on reflections of

7242.3 --> 7247.9400000000005
the material realm right

7245.36 --> 7251.719
it's like this giant pool of Reflections

7247.94 --> 7253.638999999999
upon ages of billions of people

7251.719 --> 7256.159
some of them brilliant some of them

7253.639 --> 7258.7390000000005
super deviant and there's infinite

7256.159 --> 7262.179
information to potentially do things

7258.739 --> 7262.178999999999
with but all that information

7263.02 --> 7271.119000000001
Reflections all material Realm

7267.08 --> 7271.119
and that is my point

7273.02 --> 7282.56
yeah it is the very fabric the language

7278.659 --> 7287.0
of what our Spirits use

7282.56 --> 7289.52
that is what reality is to us

7287.0 --> 7293.3
you can't escape that

7289.52 --> 7297.88
it is what defines consciousness

7293.3 --> 7297.88
a reflection upon the material Realm

7330.98 --> 7335.78
God speaks to me isn't a reflection of

7333.739 --> 7338.5
the physical world is it

7335.78 --> 7338.5
oh really

7338.84 --> 7344.179
so he speaks to you

7341.179 --> 7346.58
speaking hmm where does that where does

7344.179 --> 7349.42
the concept of speaking come from

7346.58 --> 7349.42
could it be

7350.119 --> 7356.9
lips of a physical being moving

7354.32 --> 7358.639
sound being created because of the air

7356.9 --> 7361.58
and the effects

7358.639 --> 7364.96
yeah speaking Yeah that's a reflection

7361.58 --> 7368.78
of the Physical Realm even the very

7364.96 --> 7371.38
metaphorical things you use to

7368.78 --> 7371.38
Express

7371.48 --> 7374.959999999999
Your Divine experience in which you

7373.58 --> 7377.0
might have had

7374.96 --> 7380.659
not saying that you didn't

7377.0 --> 7382.699
yeah all of it is all based translated

7380.659 --> 7384.5599999999995
through material realm if God's gonna

7382.699 --> 7386.419999999999
speak to us he's gonna speak to us

7384.56 --> 7389.2390000000005
through

7386.42 --> 7391.099
a language that we understand which is

7389.239 --> 7392.9
material Realm

7391.099 --> 7396.1990000000005
things

7392.9 --> 7398.78
yeah he might be more than the material

7396.199 --> 7402.638999999999
realm he created designed it all but

7398.78 --> 7402.639
it's the only thing we can understand

7405.08 --> 7409.099
right

7406.76 --> 7411.9800000000005
if we're gonna commune with him it's

7409.099 --> 7414.26
going to be some kind of representation

7411.98 --> 7419.86
that was somewhere

7414.26 --> 7419.860000000001
lent from the material realm interaction

7430.099 --> 7434.78
right and when I keep saying that it's a

7432.98 --> 7438.0199999999995
reflection of material you have to

7434.78 --> 7442.28
realize I'm not saying it's all just a

7438.02 --> 7444.1990000000005
delusion based on the materialism around

7442.28 --> 7448.4
it that's not what I'm saying at all I'm

7444.199 --> 7452.299999999999
saying it is the language of the spirit

7448.4 --> 7454.699
right if you go ontological on this [ __ ]

7452.3 --> 7457.88
and you say like okay what happens to

7454.699 --> 7460.579
all of our Spirits is suddenly

7457.88 --> 7463.6990000000005
material realm is literally dissoluted

7460.579 --> 7466.34
like whoop literally nothing black

7463.699 --> 7468.919999999999
nothing no more matter no more bodies

7466.34 --> 7471.02
just our Spirits are there like

7468.92 --> 7473.96
what the [ __ ] just happened

7471.02 --> 7477.9400000000005
right no more material Realm no more

7473.96 --> 7477.94
memory of material realm nothing

7478.28 --> 7485.659
what then what the [ __ ] is gonna happen

7481.159 --> 7488.598999999999
are we then capable of recreating

7485.659 --> 7490.5199999999995
our own envisioned material realm well

7488.599 --> 7492.679
that would only be possible if we'd

7490.52 --> 7495.9800000000005
still have memories of the material

7492.679 --> 7498.32
realm somehow in the spirit

7495.98 --> 7501.919999999999
and then we would be creating our own

7498.32 --> 7503.84
simulation of a material Realm

7501.92 --> 7505.579
outside of the material realm because it

7503.84 --> 7507.079
would be would have been dissoluted

7505.579 --> 7510.32
right

7507.079 --> 7514.099
and maybe that could be Heaven whatever

7510.32 --> 7516.619
but yeah what if it never comes back

7514.099 --> 7519.32
at some point

7516.619 --> 7520.5199999999995
we're just going to be re-running a

7519.32 --> 7522.739
program

7520.52 --> 7525.34
because the amount of Reflections are

7522.739 --> 7525.339999999999
limited

7525.5 --> 7529.34
so it's just going to be a looping

7527.06 --> 7530.860000000001
memory program then because there's no

7529.34 --> 7534.4400000000005
more physical

7530.86 --> 7538.098999999999
realm interactions to reflect upon

7534.44 --> 7540.86
only recycled stuff from the past from

7538.099 --> 7543.28
the Physical Realm

7540.86 --> 7543.28
right

7551.84 --> 7556.52
more than yeah but you down on Rick back

7554.42 --> 7558.1990000000005
we're not talking in the same category

7556.52 --> 7559.400000000001
here

7558.199 --> 7561.44
dude

7559.4 --> 7563.78
I'm not saying

7561.44 --> 7565.46
there is nothing outside of the Physical

7563.78 --> 7569.119
Realm

7565.46 --> 7570.619
yeah I've been there this weird [ __ ] man

7569.119 --> 7572.36
there's weird [ __ ] in the other

7570.619 --> 7574.339999999999
dimensions yeah

7572.36 --> 7578.38
but all of that

7574.34 --> 7583.179
really only exists logically

7578.38 --> 7583.179
because there is a material Realm

7583.639 --> 7589.159000000001
on which the ideas which is what key is

7587.239 --> 7591.678999999999
keeping things together in the spiritual

7589.159 --> 7594.679
Realms is ideas in spirit

7591.679 --> 7598.28
and memory

7594.679 --> 7598.28
right evocation

7598.94 --> 7604.46
of the spirit it's all based on the

7602.3 --> 7607.9400000000005
material Realm

7604.46 --> 7612.02
how would you ever come up with a heaven

7607.94 --> 7614.839999999999
right if there wasn't something really

7612.02 --> 7616.88
inspiring and glorious in the material

7614.84 --> 7618.619000000001
realm that would remind you of it and

7616.88 --> 7620.42
then you think like oh man I wish my

7618.619 --> 7623.48
heaven was like that with that and maybe

7620.42 --> 7625.52
better right if you've never seen

7623.48 --> 7626.36
anything that would inspire you like

7625.52 --> 7629.42
that

7626.36 --> 7632.48
then how could you ever think that could

7629.42 --> 7634.6990000000005
exist in your mind right somebody might

7632.48 --> 7637.82
told Heaven it'll mean nothing to you

7634.699 --> 7642.638999999999
because you have nothing in the material

7637.82 --> 7642.639
realm to reflect upon

7644.599 --> 7648.26
it's just somebody's words it doesn't

7647.06 --> 7651.76
mean anything

7648.26 --> 7651.76
because it can't inspire you

7652.88 --> 7658.46
right can trigger hope maybe what you

7655.639 --> 7661.76
would have to have like you can't become

7658.46 --> 7666.34
a hope addict if you haven't like

7661.76 --> 7666.34
actually seen something really inspiring

7666.739 --> 7672.138999999999
which is a reflection in the material

7669.02 --> 7674.360000000001
realm and in the spirit and the like the

7672.139 --> 7676.34
sub material realm you know most people

7674.36 --> 7678.0199999999995
dwell with their spirits in the sub

7676.34 --> 7682.04
material realm they

7678.02 --> 7683.540000000001
go into Spirit interactions within it so

7682.04 --> 7686.0
the material realm is all secondary

7683.54 --> 7689.679
right it is the storyboard for what the

7686.0 --> 7689.679
spirit creates in our minds

7689.719 --> 7695.54
I'd like to remind you that all the

7691.88 --> 7697.400000000001
paint is still material realm right we

7695.54 --> 7699.8
kind of just kind of like oh yeah of

7697.4 --> 7701.78
course we don't think about that

7699.8 --> 7704.1990000000005
right but it is all based and

7701.78 --> 7707.78
contextualized and visualized and heard

7704.199 --> 7710.5
simulated all based on material Realm

7707.78 --> 7710.5
all of it

7712.159 --> 7715.239
and that's my point

7716.36 --> 7721.04
right

7718.159 --> 7722.9
now I understand if you might think that

7721.04 --> 7726.34
this is like some kind of materialist

7722.9 --> 7726.339999999999
statement but it isn't actually

7728.42 --> 7734.599
very well aware of the difference

7730.4 --> 7737.78
between the material and the spirit

7734.599 --> 7739.76
and it bet the spirit absolutely exists

7737.78 --> 7742.5199999999995
separately

7739.76 --> 7744.5
right and even yeah even com can be

7742.52 --> 7747.7390000000005
completely separate even from the

7744.5 --> 7750.079
material realm in itself

7747.739 --> 7752.598999999999
that there is other dimensions which you

7750.079 --> 7755.0599999999995
can thread that are not Material

7752.599 --> 7758.84
but anything you might experience or see

7755.06 --> 7761.719
are still only going to do anything to

7758.84 --> 7765.56
you if there is any sort of Reflection

7761.719 --> 7768.26
from the material Realm

7765.56 --> 7770.84
because that's the only thing that can

7768.26 --> 7774.5
even reach our spirit

7770.84 --> 7776.679
without it it doesn't mean anything to

7774.5 --> 7776.679
us

7781.76 --> 7786.38
like all the symbols all the metaphors

7784.219 --> 7790.4
all the

7786.38 --> 7792.619
archetypes iconography everything is all

7790.4 --> 7794.0
derived from the material realm in some

7792.619 --> 7796.04
way all of it

7794.0 --> 7799.34
right and then we think that's the

7796.04 --> 7801.739
spirit no that's the spirit using the

7799.34 --> 7804.38
language that was made in reflection to

7801.739 --> 7806.119
the material realm very efficiently it's

7804.38 --> 7808.159000000001
programmed in us we understand the

7806.119 --> 7811.759999999999
symbols we get it we get metaphors we

7808.159 --> 7811.759999999999
get it immediately right

7812.06 --> 7820.360000000001
but but because it's so refined

7816.44 --> 7825.5599999999995
it's all derived from Spirit

7820.36 --> 7827.78
dependency of existence in like how the

7825.56 --> 7829.76
experience is in reflection to the

7827.78 --> 7832.639
material realm they've refined it they

7829.76 --> 7834.9800000000005
figure out this is how it works these

7832.639 --> 7837.56
are the symbols these are the archetypes

7834.98 --> 7839.598999999999
these are the metaphors that work so

7837.56 --> 7841.400000000001
well that people get immediately even if

7839.599 --> 7845.3
they've never heard it before

7841.4 --> 7848.42
right bang like oh I get that right why

7845.3 --> 7852.1990000000005
because they were designed

7848.42 --> 7854.3
to make it very efficient for spirits to

7852.199 --> 7857.419999999999
reflect upon something that's kind of

7854.3 --> 7859.76
easy to do for the spirit because that's

7857.42 --> 7863.079
how the spirit is designed to reflect

7859.76 --> 7863.079000000001
upon the material Realm

7869.0 --> 7873.619
right

7870.5 --> 7876.02
I know this must be very confusing to a

7873.619 --> 7879.46
whole bunch of people but I'm making a

7876.02 --> 7879.46
very serious statement here

7880.159 --> 7884.0199999999995
I'm probably gonna run out this show

7886.28 --> 7891.579
it's been over two hours I'm definitely

7888.619 --> 7891.579
gonna title this one

7901.46 --> 7904.119
huh

7905.36 --> 7910.598999999999
awesome Rick back that means that you're

7908.06 --> 7910.599
seeing it

7911.239 --> 7917.739
which seeing is still like a reflection

7914.48 --> 7917.739
upon the material Realm

7918.98 --> 7925.459999999999
I mean even the idea of fractals right

7923.179 --> 7928.34
this for me a reflection upon the

7925.46 --> 7930.86
material around which one the readout of

7928.34 --> 7933.5
a computer calculated

7930.86 --> 7935.48
program that showed that to me the

7933.5 --> 7937.579
mandelbrot right

7935.48 --> 7939.259999999999
and that's conceptual it's a pattern

7937.579 --> 7941.239
yeah yeah but it's still being

7939.26 --> 7943.280000000001
represented in the Physical Realm and

7941.239 --> 7945.678999999999
that's how my spirit remembers it and

7943.28 --> 7949.179
Associates it yeah because of the

7945.679 --> 7949.179
reflection in the material Realm

7951.079 --> 7954.5199999999995
because that's how it works

7964.9 --> 7968.92
what am I gonna title this

7978.75 --> 7982.13
[Music]

7989.1 --> 7994.2300000000005
[Music]

7991.47 --> 7998.05
[Applause]

7994.23 --> 7998.049999999999
[Music]

8006.099 --> 8010.4400000000005
God damn it that was way too long

8014.56 --> 8016.8
foreign

8048.94 --> 8051.48
okay

8089.079 --> 8092.4
okay rig back

8095.619 --> 8099.639
yeah

8097.42 --> 8102.219
like more visceral out of body

8099.639 --> 8104.02
experiences are creepy as [ __ ] I don't

8102.219 --> 8106.659
like that

8104.02 --> 8109.3
I don't like to like have my spirit like

8106.659 --> 8110.799999999999
try to get out of my physical body like

8109.3 --> 8113.079000000001
wow

8110.8 --> 8115.719
like in this realm in the Physical Realm

8113.079 --> 8117.579
I don't like that at all

8115.719 --> 8120.219
I mean in my dreams

8117.579 --> 8122.44
like when I'm zoned in

8120.219 --> 8124.96
like that when I'm not physically

8122.44 --> 8127.96
consciously here

8124.96 --> 8132.06
I have absolutely no problem like I can

8127.96 --> 8132.06
fly like Superman

8133.199 --> 8137.199
and better

8135.099 --> 8141.159000000001
more efficient

8137.199 --> 8142.48
like stick to ceilings Glide over a

8141.159 --> 8144.699
street

8142.48 --> 8149.04
like I'm on a hoverboard or something

8144.699 --> 8149.04
whatever I want can all do it

8161.44 --> 8166.659
right and you all of you only understood

8164.38 --> 8169.54
what I just said because I gave you

8166.659 --> 8171.879999999999
metaphors based on physical

8169.54 --> 8175.179
Realm

8171.88 --> 8178.06
things so you get

8175.179 --> 8182.079
what that was like and that is exactly

8178.06 --> 8184.06
also how the dream was it was based on

8182.079 --> 8185.799999999999
like Surrey it was surreal because I

8184.06 --> 8188.4400000000005
could do things that in the Physical

8185.8 --> 8190.900000000001
Realm are impossible

8188.44 --> 8192.88
or at least so far

8190.9 --> 8195.399
but it worked and it worked consistently

8192.88 --> 8198.938999999998
it had a pattern to it

8195.399 --> 8201.279999999999
but I even only sought out to emulate

8198.939 --> 8203.92
things that reminded me of things that

8201.28 --> 8206.439
you could do in a Physical Realm

8203.92 --> 8208.42
I was seeking that out and then getting

8206.439 --> 8210.639000000001
odd with it

8208.42 --> 8212.679
like oh I want to skateboard with

8210.639 --> 8215.199999999999
without a skateboard I'm just gonna

8212.679 --> 8218.26
float

8215.2 --> 8220.740000000002
those kind of things

8218.26 --> 8220.74
right

8220.96 --> 8227.339999999998
seeking out the things to do based on

8224.2 --> 8227.34
the material Realm

8251.74 --> 8256.199999999999
okay borders boy well why don't you try

8259.179 --> 8265.059
why don't you try it out

8262.479 --> 8269.019
I mean I've said the word Jesus Christ

8265.059 --> 8272.16
during my Dark World Visions even

8269.019 --> 8272.16
during the big ones

8272.439 --> 8276.34
and it oh my god did it have an

8274.54 --> 8279.240000000002
influence

8276.34 --> 8279.24
it's just

8281.859 --> 8286.54
a lot of these things that I was doing

8283.66 --> 8288.399
in there I will I thought that I was

8286.54 --> 8290.800000000001
opposing

8288.399 --> 8293.679
or that it was be interacting with

8290.8 --> 8296.38
others right that were trying to control

8293.679 --> 8297.58
me in ways that's how it felt it's very

8296.38 --> 8299.679
weird

8297.58 --> 8301.84
but in retrospect

8299.679 --> 8303.460000000001
a lot of those factors were actually

8301.84 --> 8306.3
myself

8303.46 --> 8306.3
it's like

8306.519 --> 8310.960000000001
instead of pondering and then changing

8308.859 --> 8313.599
your mind I would literally that

8310.96 --> 8316.059
situation would become metaphorical

8313.599 --> 8318.639000000001
from one perspective facing another

8316.059 --> 8321.759999999998
figure that even even looked like me

8318.639 --> 8325.24
right but persistent like

8321.76 --> 8328.719000000001
my traits had very specific types of

8325.24 --> 8330.399
faces which were based on figures in the

8328.719 --> 8333.219
material Realm

8330.399 --> 8335.5
very confusing to me in retrospect

8333.219 --> 8338.08
because literally

8335.5 --> 8343.24
faces that I would be dealing with

8338.08 --> 8345.939
were internal aspects of me that even

8343.24 --> 8349.42
during but also afterward in moments of

8345.939 --> 8352.599
Amnesia I forgot were actually

8349.42 --> 8355.84
like those faces weren't what they were

8352.599 --> 8358.12
it's what were designated to them when

8355.84 --> 8360.34
that experience initiated

8358.12 --> 8363.939
and had nothing to do with those people

8360.34 --> 8366.58
at all I have to like people in my

8363.939 --> 8369.819
Visions there that haunt me and then

8366.58 --> 8372.28
when I came out of it I would be like ah

8369.819 --> 8374.08
what did you do to me and the guy would

8372.28 --> 8376.0
be like what the [ __ ] are you talking

8374.08 --> 8378.399
about

8376.0 --> 8380.979
this

8378.399 --> 8383.5
they thought I was completely nuts but

8380.979 --> 8387.699999999999
it's because their faces had been stuck

8383.5 --> 8390.819
on certain figures in that experience

8387.7 --> 8392.92
and I didn't know that

8390.819 --> 8395.08
I didn't know a lot of what was going on

8392.92 --> 8398.8
when I entered that experience

8395.08 --> 8400.539999999999
it was 80 years of craziness

8398.8 --> 8402.399
and fear

8400.54 --> 8405.160000000002
in ways

8402.399 --> 8407.199999999999
like I had to be Fearless but I was

8405.16 --> 8409.6
drenched in fear

8407.2 --> 8412.66
constantly it was this is a nightmare

8409.6 --> 8415.18
80-year literal hell

8412.66 --> 8418.479
it's not

8415.18 --> 8420.76
I never think of it fondly I just I it

8418.479 --> 8422.979
is a bit exciting though it was exciting

8420.76 --> 8426.76
because it was so surreal

8422.979 --> 8429.76
it was such learning potential but with

8426.76 --> 8433.0
so little ability to actually hold grasp

8429.76 --> 8437.460000000001
on anything right is why one of the

8433.0 --> 8437.46
weirdest freaky end result is that

8438.46 --> 8444.64
like the whole time aspect I have so

8441.819 --> 8446.859
little that I can even do with it I saw

8444.64 --> 8448.779999999999
all that's what I thought I could get

8446.859 --> 8450.28
out of it as an advantage oh I can see

8448.78 --> 8453.460000000001
into the future and then it can work

8450.28 --> 8455.380000000001
towards that and get prepared and

8453.46 --> 8458.14
but

8455.38 --> 8462.759999999998
now much later

8458.14 --> 8465.16
it just seems like no it I can't like

8462.76 --> 8467.2
even if I see if I remember something

8465.16 --> 8470.8
like this is coming you know what

8467.2 --> 8474.399000000001
happens I get Terror I get super hard

8470.8 --> 8477.099999999999
fear like like God's looking at me like

8474.399 --> 8479.68
are you going to actually abuse that

8477.1 --> 8483.16
experience now and bypass the time

8479.68 --> 8484.899
because that's gonna [ __ ] you up

8483.16 --> 8488.68
scared

8484.899 --> 8491.56
like I'm scared of basically sharing you

8488.68 --> 8494.02
with you things about the future from my

8491.56 --> 8496.72
Visions even if I catch on to them and

8494.02 --> 8498.7
they don't catch on to it a lot but some

8496.72 --> 8500.92
things yeah very early there's things

8498.7 --> 8503.26
that just got in there very like five

8500.92 --> 8505.899
years ago like still like there like

8503.26 --> 8509.02
whoa [ __ ]

8505.899 --> 8511.779999999999
I just can't really place

8509.02 --> 8513.939
where after everything that's going to

8511.78 --> 8515.92
happen right now it's going to start to

8513.939 --> 8517.960000000001
take place but I still have memories of

8515.92 --> 8520.14
it I can't even describe to you what it

8517.96 --> 8520.14
is

8525.939 --> 8527.939
um

8540.88 --> 8543.479
what

8569.979 --> 8573.06
right anyway

8580.12 --> 8585.640000000001
I would technically keep on going but

8583.24 --> 8588.22
yeah my cheek is getting

8585.64 --> 8590.14
annoying

8588.22 --> 8593.26
I've been going for two hours and 20

8590.14 --> 8596.099999999999
minutes and it was interesting

8593.26 --> 8596.1
most of it

8603.22 --> 8608.56
I seem to like you're now all dreaming

8605.92 --> 8609.88
about such things in your own mind

8608.56 --> 8612.22
I didn't notice when that happens

8609.88 --> 8614.5
because then you kind of stop

8612.22 --> 8616.66
responding to me and start to like talk

8614.5 --> 8620.76
among yourselves

8616.66 --> 8620.76
but still about that subject

8628.06 --> 8634.08
I guess I have that effect on people

8630.46 --> 8634.08
when I dig really deep

8640.96 --> 8644.74
right

8642.34 --> 8647.74
but I am gonna round out

8644.74 --> 8649.3
so thanks everyone for coming I hope you

8647.74 --> 8652.479
liked this show I thought it was really

8649.3 --> 8655.3
good despite the condition I hope it's

8652.479 --> 8658.358999999999
not too distracting

8655.3 --> 8660.699999999999
I mean audio wise

8658.359 --> 8663.16
I'm still pretty

8660.7 --> 8666.04
pretty the same right it's not like I'm

8663.16 --> 8668.22
I sound like a swollen potato or

8666.04 --> 8668.220000000001
anything

8668.62 --> 8673.060000000001
right but yeah it was managed it was

8670.72 --> 8676.3
able to focus today very well on this

8673.06 --> 8678.699999999999
hyper esoteric subject

8676.3 --> 8681.22
and yeah re-emphasize a point that I've

8678.7 --> 8683.140000000001
been building up to in what is it now

8681.22 --> 8685.3
last two weeks

8683.14 --> 8688.42
been saying that before reflections of

8685.3 --> 8691.119999999999
material it just hit me just hit me I

8688.42 --> 8695.02
love it but how that happens by the way

8691.12 --> 8696.640000000001
because what I'm rolling on right now is

8695.02 --> 8699.1
not something that's just typically

8696.64 --> 8701.26
going around yet if you know what I mean

8699.1 --> 8703.42
and then I get this moment of like oh

8701.26 --> 8705.64
yeah yeah I got first I got first I got

8703.42 --> 8707.68
first I got first I'm a special boy I

8705.64 --> 8710.22
got first yeah

8707.68 --> 8710.220000000001
whatever

8710.26 --> 8716.26
okay somebody's probably gonna make a

8712.42 --> 8717.399
silly video of that now

8716.26 --> 8720.22
but

8717.399 --> 8721.68
it's my conclusion

8720.22 --> 8725.38
right

8721.68 --> 8727.0
as much as the celestials are

8725.38 --> 8729.759999999998
holographic

8727.0 --> 8731.92
is something that I definitely have been

8729.76 --> 8734.2
saying for a long time and some people

8731.92 --> 8735.58
are almost drawing to similar

8734.2 --> 8737.800000000001
conclusions now

8735.58 --> 8740.859
for five years or more

8737.8 --> 8743.64
but I think that this one is also a

8740.859 --> 8743.640000000001
noteworthy one

8743.68 --> 8749.04
and yeah today I really laid it out very

8746.319 --> 8749.039999999999
extensively

8749.439 --> 8753.220000000001
