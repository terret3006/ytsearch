right so the weather today

97.36 --> 100.759
is extraordinary

100.96 --> 106.399
just

102.64 --> 106.399
i did not expect this

106.6 --> 111.079
[Music]

107.68 --> 111.07900000000001
look at that

126.96 --> 133.039
look at how blue that sky is

130.239 --> 133.03900000000002
unbelievable

135.44 --> 140.52
and

136.48 --> 140.51999999999998
uh camera freeze

148.959 --> 154.239
and yeah there's this constant wind

151.92 --> 155.83999999999997
keeping my door open

154.239 --> 159.04
and

155.84 --> 161.519
yeah it's really pleasant actually here

159.04 --> 161.519
in here

169.36 --> 171.84
right

171.92 --> 177.44
anyway hello neil degrasse tyson lies

174.879 --> 179.599
first in chat ladder sage good to see

177.44 --> 179.599
you

180.239 --> 185.84
it is tuesday the 9th of august 2022

187.519 --> 191.36
i'm hope

189.12 --> 195.92000000000002
hoping today is going to be

191.36 --> 195.92000000000002
just a nice show just like the weather

196.959 --> 199.84
i'm not gonna be

200.08 --> 202.8
talking about

203.44 --> 209.12
terrible pinnacle situations

207.28 --> 213.64000000000001
too much if i can

209.12 --> 213.64000000000001
you know you're a blood type uh

215.28 --> 218.48
i was keep forgetting

220.319 --> 225.23899999999998
i i literally always keep forgetting it

240.879 --> 245.64
why do you ask neil degrasse tyson lies

261.12 --> 267.479
right by the way i got some apple juice

264.16 --> 267.47900000000004
for a change

268.479 --> 274.88
yesterday i almost got it dehydrated

272.24 --> 274.88
during the show

275.6 --> 280.08000000000004
i thought i was gonna not do that

278.96 --> 282.79999999999995
today

280.08 --> 284.479
ah right interested in re negative yeah

282.8 --> 288.32
i thought it was gonna be about that

284.479 --> 288.32
yeah i probably have that too

290.96 --> 294.35999999999996
it is likely

296.08 --> 299.75899999999996
but yeah i've never like had it tested

298.16 --> 302.16
or anything

299.759 --> 304.639
when that all came up

302.16 --> 307.199
like uh patricia steer was also talking

304.639 --> 311.40000000000003
about that stuff like years ago when she

307.199 --> 311.40000000000003
was doing streams still

315.91 --> 319.09900000000005
[Music]

324.96 --> 330.4
hey jeff gassad good to see you

327.68 --> 330.40000000000003
how are you doing

335.68 --> 339.759
yeah by the way sorry for starting a

337.68 --> 342.0
little more late than normal

339.759 --> 345.12
i try to aim not to be like later than

342.0 --> 346.4
five or ten minutes normally

345.12 --> 349.919
it just happens

346.4 --> 352.479
but yeah today it was really the weather

349.919 --> 355.19899999999996
i was just like enjoying things and then

352.479 --> 358.08
i realized like oh wait [ __ ] i actually

355.199 --> 358.08
have to do a show

358.16 --> 361.26000000000005
was that

359.28 --> 363.11999999999995
it's just one of those days

361.26 --> 366.12
[Music]

363.12 --> 366.12
eh

384.08 --> 389.08
okay

384.96 --> 389.08
letter sage that is weird

397.919 --> 400.919
hmm

411.44 --> 416.4
i think that they do have a way to

413.36 --> 419.44
determine that but it's probably not so

416.4 --> 421.039
easy and would have some costs added to

419.44 --> 424.8
it

421.039 --> 427.199
i would presume flatter sage

424.8 --> 427.199
anyway

428.88 --> 434.479
hey pgcnet

431.37 --> 437.28000000000003
[Music]

434.479 --> 439.11
all right

437.28 --> 442.32899999999995
busy day

439.11 --> 442.329
[Music]

443.68 --> 448.08
yeah yesterday to me was a really weird

445.84 --> 448.08
day

448.56 --> 452.8
i mean i got really pissed off again

455.44 --> 460.639
and

456.8 --> 462.8
yeah it is not good for me

460.639 --> 464.479
when that happens

462.8 --> 468.319
like and it's

464.479 --> 470.639
it's an interesting exploration

468.319 --> 474.40000000000003
sounds weird right but yeah i am

470.639 --> 476.56
exploring my own rage in ways and seeing

474.4 --> 478.71999999999997
like how can i do this

476.56 --> 481.28000000000003
without ending up hurting myself in some

478.72 --> 483.52000000000004
way and like what are the

481.28 --> 485.599
actual consequences of everything that i

483.52 --> 488.479
say

485.599 --> 490.4
and sometimes in the days especially

488.479 --> 493.52
typically at night i might just like

490.4 --> 494.96
sometimes like a spooky feeling can like

493.52 --> 497.28
crawl over me

494.96 --> 500.479
and then i look at everything that i do

497.28 --> 503.44
from another perspective that is

500.479 --> 505.919
not from a perspective of confidence

503.44 --> 508.71999999999997
and then i'm like holy [ __ ]

505.919 --> 510.71999999999997
what am i doing

508.72 --> 513.599
and then i like get afraid of what

510.72 --> 515.919
people might think but i quickly trained

513.599 --> 519.09
myself to push all that away

515.919 --> 521.76
because there's absolutely no point

519.09 --> 524.399
[Music]

521.76 --> 525.76
just gotta go with it

524.399 --> 528.72
and hey

525.76 --> 530.88
it's still there i'm not getting police

528.72 --> 532.08
visits

530.88 --> 535.279
right

532.08 --> 538.24
i am i am not getting those

535.279 --> 539.76
i'm not even getting demonetized

538.24 --> 542.88
so

539.76 --> 542.88
for some reason

544.47 --> 548.48
[Music]

547.04 --> 553.0
this is

548.48 --> 553.0
i i can just do this

564.08 --> 568.08
i guess that yeah when i think about it

566.08 --> 570.48
more carefully all of it together like

568.08 --> 574.0
since it started at 82

570.48 --> 574.0
it is really like i'm

574.08 --> 580.8000000000001
sort of like rolling into like

578.0 --> 583.12
predictions

580.8 --> 585.3599999999999
but the thing is that when i roll into

583.12 --> 585.36
that

586.0 --> 593.68
it grabs me hold so much that i kind of

589.279 --> 593.68
lose track of that it is that

594.399 --> 598.399
i just get right into it

596.8 --> 601.5999999999999
i live it

598.399 --> 604.32
and like dude i'm like

601.6 --> 607.12
seeing all kinds of things and all that

604.32 --> 607.12
when that happens

609.36 --> 614.0790000000001
it's important for trauma care to go

611.2 --> 617.0790000000001
someone's blood type

614.079 --> 617.079
okay

636.72 --> 640.8000000000001
well

638.64 --> 642.959
technically sounds weird i could always

640.8 --> 645.4399999999999
like call up my doctor

642.959 --> 648.64
and ask him or her

645.44 --> 648.6400000000001
doesn't even know what it is

651.36 --> 656.399
i mean they have like my medical records

653.6 --> 657.279
and all that under their care

656.399 --> 658.56
it's

657.279 --> 661.8389999999999
in that

658.56 --> 661.8389999999999
it should be

663.12 --> 668.32
i mean it's not like my blood type is

665.6 --> 670.0
universally unknown by the medical

668.32 --> 672.6400000000001
system

670.0 --> 675.6
it's just not really readily available

672.64 --> 678.079
inside of my contemporary conscious

675.6 --> 678.0790000000001
memory

681.04 --> 685.04
besides i've like never even needed it

686.399 --> 690.8
really rare blood type

688.48 --> 690.8000000000001
okay

691.6 --> 696.519
i don't think my blood type is that rare

702.32 --> 706.399
oh

703.44 --> 706.399
haha wind

706.48 --> 709.12
you see that

710.8 --> 714.079
the wind is like really blowing through

712.8 --> 715.12
the place

714.079 --> 717.3599999999999
great

715.12 --> 718.9590000000001
like clear blue sky

717.36 --> 721.04
in the sun

718.959 --> 722.8
it's it feels like it's really cleaning

721.04 --> 724.8
up the place

722.8 --> 726.3199999999999
and i just also

724.8 --> 728.3199999999999
vacuum clean

726.32 --> 731.839
yesterday

728.32 --> 731.839
evening so this is like

732.78 --> 735.929
[Music]

739.279 --> 742.399
right anyway uh

742.56 --> 746.56
flat side had an interesting little

744.48 --> 748.0
video

746.56 --> 750.88
which i thought first was going to be

748.0 --> 752.88
about coriolis effect but then it's it's

750.88 --> 754.959
more like

752.88 --> 756.8
a bit of meteorology

754.959 --> 759.68
with some good animations very

756.8 --> 760.959
interesting

759.68 --> 765.8389999999999
it really

760.959 --> 765.8389999999999
gave me a perspective on how practically

766.079 --> 772.56
yeah whether fronts really happen like

768.639 --> 773.839
how that effect like a mechanism cold

772.56 --> 776.2399999999999
air

773.839 --> 778.9590000000001
on one side hot air on another and there

776.24 --> 781.279
is like a stream that forms a stream

778.959 --> 784.8389999999999
just these two temperature differentials

781.279 --> 787.4399999999999
causes a steady stream within the

784.839 --> 791.36
air that's it

787.44 --> 791.36
that's the fundamental effect

798.32 --> 801.32
right

822.32 --> 825.32
ah

832.32 --> 836.72
i'm thinking maybe i do want some tea

834.48 --> 838.16
after all

836.72 --> 842.399
but

838.16 --> 844.639
yeah i'll just leave it for now

842.399 --> 844.639
uh

845.199 --> 850.56
what was i talking about i'm very loose

847.199 --> 853.519
today i kind of i i should like

850.56 --> 856.0
leave it a bit like that

853.519 --> 858.9590000000001
don't want to like get all too

856.0 --> 861.76
all too crunchy and

858.959 --> 864.8
get myself worked up again i really kind

861.76 --> 868.68
of like need a being worked up break

864.8 --> 868.68
from the last two days

870.399 --> 874.56
heats create

871.76 --> 876.639
higher pressure

874.56 --> 877.92
no no it's the other way around you have

876.639 --> 880.88
gas head

877.92 --> 883.279
heat actually causes the gas to expand

880.88 --> 884.399
mostly upward that's where the most room

883.279 --> 886.639
is

884.399 --> 890.16
and cold air causes

886.639 --> 890.16
cold causes air to shrink

893.68 --> 898.16
so it's the other way around oddly

895.279 --> 900.24
enough

898.16 --> 901.279
good servant good to see you go make

900.24 --> 903.12
some tea

901.279 --> 905.519
okay

903.12 --> 909.16
all right good servant

905.519 --> 909.16
if you say so

993.12 --> 996.279
all right

997.44 --> 1000.639
a healthy chef

1001.759 --> 1004.639
george sanford

1009.04 --> 1013.36
heat does cause a higher pressure

1012.399 --> 1016.16
well

1013.36 --> 1019.1990000000001
yield the chef that's only yeah

1016.16 --> 1024.44
because it causes gas to expand the heat

1019.199 --> 1024.44
and then that's yeah if it's in a

1024.48 --> 1028.4
smaller yeah relatively small container

1026.559 --> 1030.319
and the entire thing is heating up yeah

1028.4 --> 1032.72
that's then gonna cause effective

1030.319 --> 1032.72
pressure

1033.6 --> 1039.52
but in a mesh

1036.079 --> 1041.76
of gas like the inhomogeneous air

1039.52 --> 1041.76
right

1042.16 --> 1046.799
there it's effectively just going to

1044.24 --> 1049.199
expand and then actually be lower

1046.799 --> 1049.199
pressure

1050.4 --> 1054.3200000000002
right

1051.36 --> 1056.9599999999998
it's gonna press on the air kind of push

1054.32 --> 1059.2
it aside but effectively inside of it it

1056.96 --> 1062.919
is lower pressure

1059.2 --> 1062.919
isn't that just weird

1069.919 --> 1074.0800000000002
so it's almost weirdly enough like an

1072.24 --> 1076.16
explosion effect

1074.08 --> 1079.1999999999998
right i mean an explosion pushes

1076.16 --> 1080.799
everything up of very hardly harshly

1079.2 --> 1082.24
aside and then

1080.799 --> 1085.039
often

1082.24 --> 1088.559
there's like a vacuum that almost forms

1085.039 --> 1089.28
because of the rapid expansion in within

1088.559 --> 1091.039
a

1089.28 --> 1093.2
big explosion and then a slight

1091.039 --> 1094.8799999999999
implosion that happens

1093.2 --> 1097.8400000000001
a lot of the time especially with really

1094.88 --> 1097.8400000000001
big explosions

1098.88 --> 1104.68
it's kind of the same effect except not

1101.919 --> 1107.91
explosive

1104.68 --> 1107.91
[Music]

1129.44 --> 1134.16
pressure creates the heat

1131.919 --> 1139.039
right but that is within

1134.16 --> 1139.039
a confine right within a closed confine

1140.88 --> 1144.16
where the entire thing is effectively

1143.039 --> 1147.2
heating up

1144.16 --> 1149.6000000000001
not allowing the pressure to go away

1147.2 --> 1151.8400000000001
and then it heats up

1149.6 --> 1151.84
well

1152.72 --> 1158.48
the air in the realm doesn't heat up to

1155.679 --> 1158.48
that scale

1159.28 --> 1162.84
it's only locally and then

1161.84 --> 1166.72
it just

1162.84 --> 1169.12
pushes the less hot air apart

1166.72 --> 1173.559
and inside will be lower pressure that's

1169.12 --> 1173.559
how it works in the dynamic system

1179.36 --> 1185.6789999999999
right so it's interesting right

1181.76 --> 1187.36
great i love that just very small videos

1185.679 --> 1189.76
that are kind of open

1187.36 --> 1193.32
and you learn a lot so thank you for

1199.74 --> 1202.94
[Music]

1204.84 --> 1208.6399999999999

1210.08 --> 1213.76
was i doing yesterday

1219.6 --> 1222.799
yeah flat earth debates

1223.76 --> 1226.64
it lasted fairly long

1225.48 --> 1229.52
[Music]

1226.64 --> 1232.5200000000002
not like a four-hour show but

1229.52 --> 1232.52
uh

1236.0 --> 1242.08
it was a very energetic kind of over the

1239.52 --> 1243.2
place conversation

1242.08 --> 1244.8799999999999
with some

1243.2 --> 1248.0800000000002
yeah

1244.88 --> 1250.48
glad earthers talking about ether again

1248.08 --> 1250.48
also

1253.679 --> 1258.72
i yeah i accident i got on 10th man's

1256.72 --> 1261.6000000000001
nerves

1258.72 --> 1264.32
apparently enough for him to leave

1261.6 --> 1266.8799999999999
i didn't mean it and i really didn't

1264.32 --> 1269.6789999999999
but i was a bit like

1266.88 --> 1270.7990000000002
jump and quickly make a like two-word

1269.679 --> 1272.88
remark

1270.799 --> 1274.799
i was very much in that mood on flat

1272.88 --> 1276.3200000000002
earth debate yesterday and i guess yeah

1274.799 --> 1278.1589999999999
some people that really gets on their

1276.32 --> 1280.24
nerves

1278.159 --> 1283.1200000000001
sorry about that

1280.24 --> 1284.4
but my input was good i was very high

1283.12 --> 1286.3999999999999
energy

1284.4 --> 1289.3600000000001
and focused

1286.4 --> 1291.679
just kind of desperate to find like

1289.36 --> 1294.08
quickly jump in like boom

1291.679 --> 1294.68
just short words

1294.08 --> 1296.6399999999999
but uh

1294.68 --> 1299.679
[Music]

1296.64 --> 1299.679
good show overall

1301.2 --> 1306.24
nathan got some insane large donations

1304.0 --> 1307.28
for his computer somehow

1306.24 --> 1308.799
also

1307.28 --> 1312.76
kind of jealous

1308.799 --> 1312.76
but yeah good for him

1334.08 --> 1337.8799999999999
okay george sanford

1346.08 --> 1351.039
uh yeah also watch more netflix

1351.12 --> 1355.07
the sandman

1354.0 --> 1355.29
and

1355.07 --> 1357.6789999999999
[Music]

1355.29 --> 1360.1589999999999
[Applause]

1357.679 --> 1363.679
it's still good but just i'm starting to

1360.159 --> 1367.2
notice a certain pattern sneaking in

1363.679 --> 1367.2
and i do not like that

1367.36 --> 1372.3999999999999
because it's like getting kind of gay

1371.44 --> 1375.8400000000001
not

1372.4 --> 1375.8400000000001
yeah but it's

1376.08 --> 1384.1589999999999
it's the gothic type of gay

1379.919 --> 1386.3200000000002
not like freaking gross demon clown gay

1384.159 --> 1387.919
like it is now so but

1386.32 --> 1390.559
it's like weird because i kind of

1387.919 --> 1392.88
recognized like oh [ __ ] man this it like

1390.559 --> 1394.559
it takes me back because

1392.88 --> 1396.72
yeah

1394.559 --> 1399.2
when the parties and all that and went

1396.72 --> 1402.08
out with friends and yeah

1399.2 --> 1404.4
that's sort of [ __ ] was there like

1402.08 --> 1407.84
everywhere

1404.4 --> 1410.3200000000002
and i was like used to it and i didn't

1407.84 --> 1412.3999999999999
really let it get to me it was for not

1410.32 --> 1416.12
for or against it but

1412.4 --> 1416.1200000000001
it's just like oh

1416.159 --> 1419.44
i'm so over that

1420.32 --> 1424.96
or past it

1422.72 --> 1427.84
if you will

1424.96 --> 1433.039
so yeah that's a bit annoying with

1427.84 --> 1433.039
the sandman still very very interesting

1433.36 --> 1438.08
it's like there's so much they do

1437.279 --> 1439.44
with

1438.08 --> 1441.84
with this

1439.44 --> 1443.2
realm conception with this interplanar

1441.84 --> 1446.08
system

1443.2 --> 1447.8400000000001
and they are effectively like angels

1446.08 --> 1450.1589999999999
this is pretty much what i'm concluding

1447.84 --> 1451.36
they don't really call it like that

1450.159 --> 1454.0800000000002
but they're like

1451.36 --> 1456.24
functionaries for the system

1454.08 --> 1459.6
for god's creation

1456.24 --> 1463.919
it is really like yeah

1459.6 --> 1463.9189999999999
it's really hard to argue against that

1464.32 --> 1470.559
structurally

1466.799 --> 1473.84
but yeah there's like oh my god

1470.559 --> 1473.84
i can't believe they actually

1473.919 --> 1478.0
made like the angel of lust

1476.64 --> 1478.96
like a

1478.0 --> 1482.48
very

1478.96 --> 1482.48
very gay guy

1484.84 --> 1488.1589999999999
ugh like

1488.799 --> 1495.2
he's sort of like goes her like gay

1491.6 --> 1496.9599999999998
almost not as spooky eyes but like

1495.2 --> 1499.8400000000001
yeah that's pretty much what they were

1496.96 --> 1502.24
trying to go for and he pulls it off but

1499.84 --> 1504.799
it's like oh my god really i have to

1502.24 --> 1504.799
watch this

1505.84 --> 1510.9599999999998
i do not like

1507.84 --> 1514.76
the angela loss

1510.96 --> 1514.76
but that's personal

1517.039 --> 1521.44
i did like the setup though

1519.6 --> 1524.0
they're setting up all kinds of things

1521.44 --> 1526.159
they're basically like pantheon building

1524.0 --> 1529.679
that's what this would be considered as

1526.159 --> 1530.96
in d d their pantheon building and it's

1529.679 --> 1533.8400000000001
really

1530.96 --> 1535.679
really focused

1533.84 --> 1537.9189999999999
somebody put a lot of very careful

1535.679 --> 1542.48
attention into it and that

1537.919 --> 1544.4
makes me compelled to continue watching

1542.48 --> 1545.679
even though there's like the

1544.4 --> 1548.799
episode

1545.679 --> 1553.039
oh it is an evil episode and then

1548.799 --> 1554.24
everybody goes gay and i'm like oh no ah

1553.039 --> 1557.84
now

1554.24 --> 1557.84
i don't want to know about this

1562.48 --> 1565.039
gross

1565.12 --> 1569.36
it's not like literal porn or anything

1567.52 --> 1570.72
but like

1569.36 --> 1571.84
yeah you

1570.72 --> 1573.34
is

1571.84 --> 1579.77
enough

1573.34 --> 1579.77
[Music]

1580.559 --> 1584.6399999999999
okay i see that nobody wants to talk

1582.96 --> 1585.52
about that i guess you all want to talk

1584.64 --> 1588.3200000000002
about

1585.52 --> 1592.6399999999999
bridges and how mechanics work right

1588.32 --> 1592.6399999999999
george sanford hill to the chef

1683.84 --> 1687.6
feedback question for you

1686.24 --> 1688.799
you know about

1687.6 --> 1690.1589999999999
my show

1688.799 --> 1691.9189999999999
what i do

1690.159 --> 1694.5590000000002
and youtube

1691.919 --> 1696.64
like what do you think and i mean i'm

1694.559 --> 1698.399
not trying to shoot myself in the foot

1696.64 --> 1700.48
here this is like you're the honest

1698.399 --> 1703.12
fascination

1700.48 --> 1705.52
like what do you think about

1703.12 --> 1707.039
me just literally going full

1705.52 --> 1709.679
rage when and

1707.039 --> 1712.48
like saying like yeah we're just

1709.679 --> 1714.72
lighter fluid and burning [ __ ]

1712.48 --> 1714.72
right

1714.799 --> 1717.9189999999999
and the ads are just still there is it

1717.2 --> 1719.52
like

1717.919 --> 1720.7990000000002
what

1719.52 --> 1722.8799999999999
what

1720.799 --> 1726.0
i mean at least

1722.88 --> 1728.7990000000002
wouldn't they be like hmm

1726.0 --> 1732.48
yeah maybe that spirit doesn't really

1728.799 --> 1732.48
sell our product or something but

1735.2 --> 1740.72
i guess it doesn't work that way

1743.36 --> 1748.1589999999999
i think it's good that youtube let you

1745.36 --> 1749.52
be hey i'm not disagreeing right that's

1748.159 --> 1752.48
why i'm saying i'm not trying to shoot

1749.52 --> 1754.8799999999999
myself in the foot it's just like

1752.48 --> 1754.88
what

1756.08 --> 1759.4399999999998
like

1757.039 --> 1759.44
really

1759.6 --> 1765.039
am i like sort of

1762.559 --> 1766.399
like how can i be approved i don't get

1765.039 --> 1769.52
it

1766.399 --> 1770.559
i don't understand i mean

1769.52 --> 1773.44
i'm

1770.559 --> 1776.6399999999999
i'm glad about it i guess but i don't

1773.44 --> 1779.039
understand i don't comprehend like how

1776.64 --> 1780.88
this is happening like that

1779.039 --> 1782.8799999999999
that i'm not like even not even getting

1780.88 --> 1785.1200000000001
a warning or anything and i just did

1782.88 --> 1785.1200000000001
what

1788.08 --> 1794.559
needs to be said i know i know jeff gas

1790.72 --> 1798.3990000000001
and that is also why i'm doing it but in

1794.559 --> 1798.399
a way it's still kind of scary

1800.08 --> 1804.32
it's

1801.44 --> 1806.0800000000002
and like i could definitely imagine that

1804.32 --> 1810.24
some people out there especially if

1806.08 --> 1810.24
they're not prepared for that at all

1811.12 --> 1816.0
they might like get really scared from

1813.44 --> 1818.48
that and if i do by the way if you're

1816.0 --> 1822.08
like somebody out there just like some

1818.48 --> 1826.32
random person that's like oh hey

1822.08 --> 1829.12
i am sorry if i'm scaring you with that

1826.32 --> 1831.84
you know you don't look every time i go

1829.12 --> 1833.279
there and i go like burn the witches

1831.84 --> 1835.4399999999998
yeah

1833.279 --> 1838.24
don't worry in the sense that i'm gonna

1835.44 --> 1840.48
be like yes everybody's a witch now

1838.24 --> 1844.3990000000001
we're gonna burn them all no no that's

1840.48 --> 1847.44
not gonna happen inside my head at least

1844.399 --> 1851.12
because my wrath is designated for very

1847.44 --> 1852.96
specifics like very specific

1851.12 --> 1855.36
right

1852.96 --> 1858.79
i'm not

1855.36 --> 1860.0
actually like berserker minded

1858.79 --> 1862.1589999999999
[Music]

1860.0 --> 1864.159
because a real berserker is just like

1862.159 --> 1866.24
once you start you just keep on

1864.159 --> 1868.3200000000002
attacking attacking even if they're your

1866.24 --> 1870.159
friends you wouldn't care you wouldn't

1868.32 --> 1871.12
even see the difference

1870.159 --> 1873.279
right

1871.12 --> 1876.559
that's not gonna happen with anything

1873.279 --> 1876.559
that i have in mind

1876.72 --> 1880.48
i mean then it would just all be over

1878.48 --> 1883.679
very quickly because everybody would die

1880.48 --> 1885.84
it's just like everybody going insane

1883.679 --> 1885.8400000000001
but

1886.08 --> 1889.6789999999999
i'm just trying to like

1890.88 --> 1896.7990000000002
do some kind of esoteric approach

1894.159 --> 1900.96
of like the feelings of people what's

1896.799 --> 1903.519
hidden inside and just the natural

1900.96 --> 1905.8400000000001
things we have inside our impulses and

1903.519 --> 1907.84
our contracts and the history like the

1905.84 --> 1909.84
contracts with god like what are we

1907.84 --> 1912.0
doing here what are you supposed to do

1909.84 --> 1914.72
with these impulses which impulses are

1912.0 --> 1917.919
of god and which aren't and why

1914.72 --> 1920.72
and how do you figure that out

1917.919 --> 1923.3600000000001
ah all right see you later pgcnet thanks

1920.72 --> 1923.3600000000001
for popping by

1923.8 --> 1928.48
[Music]

1926.72 --> 1933.08
a more widely known channel would be

1928.48 --> 1933.08
pushed more punished more hard i know

1934.159 --> 1939.519
but that's the weird thing

1936.72 --> 1942.64
i do still i get the feeling that i am

1939.519 --> 1942.64
very widely now

1946.84 --> 1952.0
which can get a lot of like

1949.76 --> 1954.0
direct proof of that

1952.0 --> 1956.64
it's just that i get the feeling that

1954.0 --> 1958.72
even if people don't really know me then

1956.64 --> 1963.039
if they got a glimpse of me it like i

1958.72 --> 1965.279
stick to their i stick to mind somehow

1963.039 --> 1967.36
and in a way i do my best to because

1965.279 --> 1969.76
yeah i have a couple of like really

1967.36 --> 1969.76
heavy

1969.919 --> 1974.96
intellectual subjects

1972.72 --> 1977.1200000000001
that are like esoteric and all that and

1974.96 --> 1979.2
spirit mechanics and like yeah the

1977.12 --> 1981.12
holographic non-local

1979.2 --> 1983.6000000000001
celestials

1981.12 --> 1985.6
looping systems

1983.6 --> 1987.6
that kind of likes

1985.6 --> 1989.9189999999999
yeah

1987.6 --> 1991.9189999999999
when people that have never even

1989.919 --> 1992.88
conceived of such a thing here about

1991.919 --> 1995.76
that

1992.88 --> 1997.3600000000001
it leaves like a separation imprint like

1995.76 --> 2000.48
oh that's

1997.36 --> 2000.4799999999998
one for the future

2002.24 --> 2008.3990000000001
it's also what i try to do

2006.32 --> 2010.96
on purpose

2008.399 --> 2013.84
it's like yeah i'm a wizard

2010.96 --> 2015.76
so think of me as a wizard and everybody

2013.84 --> 2019.36
everybody

2015.76 --> 2021.2
in middle earth knew gandalf everybody

2019.36 --> 2023.519
would immediately recognize oh that's

2021.2 --> 2025.2
gandalf they wouldn't know him they

2023.519 --> 2027.2
might even have all kinds of stupid

2025.2 --> 2029.679
rumors and suspicions and nonsense

2027.2 --> 2031.679
stories about him but everybody would

2029.679 --> 2034.24
just like i'll be like oh yeah that's

2031.679 --> 2034.24
that guy

2034.64 --> 2041.919
and maybe i am sort of achieving that

2038.32 --> 2041.9189999999999
even though i am not like

2043.6 --> 2046.399
like

2044.96 --> 2048.879
on some big

2046.399 --> 2051.2
platform

2048.879 --> 2053.52
but yeah more like what a politician

2051.2 --> 2053.52
would do

2053.919 --> 2059.2
so yeah

2056.24 --> 2062.72
they want civil unrest

2059.2 --> 2062.72
was not shown what

2067.44 --> 2070.879
my comments are censored a lot

2072.32 --> 2075.599
right well it's all it's a nitpicking

2074.32 --> 2080.159
right

2075.599 --> 2080.159
media social media they're being

2081.04 --> 2085.44
now all nitpicked to death so every

2083.76 --> 2087.9190000000003
they're just like oh you can't say this

2085.44 --> 2090.32
word you can't say that word and then

2087.919 --> 2093.52
everybody just put algorithms in place

2090.32 --> 2095.76
to desperately try to force people to

2093.52 --> 2095.7599999999998
not

2098.32 --> 2103.599
to not be

2100.839 --> 2106.16
volatile but that's people doing that

2103.599 --> 2108.88
that's not the system that's literally

2106.16 --> 2110.96
people on those platforms doing they're

2108.88 --> 2115.1600000000003
scared

2110.96 --> 2115.16
they're scared of open opinions

2120.8 --> 2123.92
and it's getting worse

2127.92 --> 2132.64
i mean the other day i got banned

2130.56 --> 2134.56
in the comment section on the infowars

2132.64 --> 2137.2799999999997
for crying out loud i mean that's

2134.56 --> 2137.2799999999997
ridiculous

2140.8 --> 2145.1600000000003
this show is very open opinion

2147.359 --> 2149.68
is it

2156.0 --> 2164.079
i guess so i mean i'm not on any kind of

2159.68 --> 2164.0789999999997
bandwagon that's out of my own control

2170.0 --> 2173.32
hey terror306

2177.599 --> 2181.28
it's a little restriction yeah but

2179.119 --> 2184.0
that's just moderate that's just keeping

2181.28 --> 2186.1600000000003
things under control

2184.0 --> 2188.4
right if everybody can choose just do

2186.16 --> 2190.96
whatever they want then eventually it

2188.4 --> 2193.2000000000003
will just go all demonic and then people

2190.96 --> 2195.2
will not

2193.2 --> 2196.48
be receptable

2195.2 --> 2198.24
anymore

2196.48 --> 2201.2
to input

2198.24 --> 2203.5989999999997
they will just use the chat to squirt

2201.2 --> 2206.48
because everything goes

2203.599 --> 2208.48
so yeah i have to put some restrictions

2206.48 --> 2211.2
on the chat but it's all

2208.48 --> 2215.56
mostly based on behavior

2211.2 --> 2215.56
not on philosophical opinion

2224.24 --> 2228.24
what

2225.44 --> 2230.32
the default restriction

2228.24 --> 2231.68
keyword block right yeah yeah but that's

2230.32 --> 2232.7200000000003
also what i mean i

2231.68 --> 2235.04
don't

2232.72 --> 2235.04
yeah

2235.76 --> 2240.079
well i have i have a default word

2238.64 --> 2243.839
blocked here

2240.079 --> 2243.8390000000004
but i tried to minimize it

2246.4 --> 2252.079
but there's one distinct word and you

2248.72 --> 2252.0789999999997
should know which one that is

2252.56 --> 2257.359
and the obvious reasons why

2254.96 --> 2259.44
but other than that yeah i'd absolutely

2257.359 --> 2261.52
try to minimize the amount of blocked

2259.44 --> 2262.88
words because it's very aggravating to

2261.52 --> 2265.88
have that

2262.88 --> 2265.88
right

2271.52 --> 2277.119
but if other people are doing that yeah

2273.68 --> 2277.1189999999997
they're literally just like

2278.32 --> 2282.7200000000003
you know like in the end if you make it

2280.56 --> 2284.7999999999997
so terrible that everything becomes

2282.72 --> 2287.04
blocked then you only end up just with

2284.8 --> 2289.6800000000003
just with chairing bots that are like

2287.04 --> 2291.04
yay oh cool oh that's the only thing

2289.68 --> 2292.96
that's left then

2291.04 --> 2295.44
eventually it's just gonna be really

2292.96 --> 2295.44
boring

2295.68 --> 2300.5989999999997
i don't know why people do that to their

2297.44 --> 2300.599
own channels

2318.56 --> 2324.5499999999997
[Music]

2335.2 --> 2340.96
all right but yeah now i think that

2339.2 --> 2343.359
look with youtube

2340.96 --> 2345.599
at the top there's issues they're all

2343.359 --> 2348.24
connected with these crazy satanic

2345.599 --> 2348.2400000000002
bastards

2348.32 --> 2352.48
google

2350.48 --> 2354.88
but like

2352.48 --> 2356.079
the people that effectively do the most

2354.88 --> 2358.32
work

2356.079 --> 2360.1600000000003
and that are doing the actual moderating

2358.32 --> 2361.839
and all that and

2360.16 --> 2364.0789999999997
and report

2361.839 --> 2367.119
situations deal with that

2364.079 --> 2370.6400000000003
i think that they are overall

2367.119 --> 2371.839
pretty decent i mean i've seen a lot

2370.64 --> 2373.1189999999997
worse

2371.839 --> 2375.92
fairing

2373.119 --> 2377.76
big organizations out there in the world

2375.92 --> 2379.6800000000003
than how youtube is doing it and yeah

2377.76 --> 2380.4
sometimes they mess up

2379.68 --> 2384.64
but

2380.4 --> 2387.04
then they also often try to correct it

2384.64 --> 2389.2
sometimes it takes a while and sometimes

2387.04 --> 2390.88
it's quick and it's like at least

2389.2 --> 2393.37
they're not like

2390.88 --> 2394.6400000000003
like they're not going in a downward

2393.37 --> 2395.68
[Music]

2394.64 --> 2398.72
climb

2395.68 --> 2401.5989999999997
or in a downward fall basically into

2398.72 --> 2403.839
like obviously going bust

2401.599 --> 2407.04
it's there's still just effort being

2403.839 --> 2410.599
made to to keep it good and instead and

2407.04 --> 2410.599
stable so

2413.52 --> 2417.04
no no was it

2415.68 --> 2420.68
no

2417.04 --> 2420.68
not gonna do that

2426.96 --> 2430.96
that's ridiculous

2428.56 --> 2434.64
why the hell would i

2430.96 --> 2439.839
ban the word insult that's that does not

2434.64 --> 2439.839
make any freaking sense was it

2462.319 --> 2466.72
is the word an insult

2464.079 --> 2467.92
well i certainly hope you think of it as

2466.72 --> 2470.9199999999996
an insult

2467.92 --> 2470.92
yeah

2482.64 --> 2487.7999999999997
wow really

2484.8 --> 2487.8
damn

2506.839 --> 2511.599
no

2508.4 --> 2514.48
okay lumpy guess in effect 6 a.m

2511.599 --> 2516.7200000000003
right that's really early i yeah i was

2514.48 --> 2519.359
really planning to take it very easy

2516.72 --> 2519.359
today so

2520.56 --> 2525.839
yes string god just leave it alone

2531.28 --> 2534.3190000000004
but yeah

2532.4 --> 2535.6800000000003
i'll try to take it easy lumpy gas in

2534.319 --> 2538.8
the vacuum if they're going to keep

2535.68 --> 2541.359
whining i'll just ban them and

2538.8 --> 2543.04
keep banning them and ignoring them so

2541.359 --> 2546.44
that there will be no trace that they

2543.04 --> 2546.44
were ever here

2557.2 --> 2560.24
you are right about now forgiving wits

2559.44 --> 2562.839
it

2560.24 --> 2566.24
oh right i brought that up on

2562.839 --> 2567.38
fed nathan was apologizing

2566.24 --> 2569.359
and i was like

2567.38 --> 2572.6400000000003
[Music]

2569.359 --> 2575.2
i don't really think that you need to do

2572.64 --> 2577.5989999999997
that i mean it's courteous but i don't

2575.2 --> 2579.4399999999996
think it's actually

2577.599 --> 2582.0
something that would be like morally

2579.44 --> 2582.0
required

2582.16 --> 2586.96
because he was acting like an ass

2585.04 --> 2588.4
you mean that part

2586.96 --> 2591.96
because that turned into quite a long

2588.4 --> 2591.96
discussion even

2598.079 --> 2604.1600000000003
what got banned on 24 7 oh okay well i

2601.359 --> 2606.48
got banned there too so

2604.16 --> 2610.06
i mean 24 7 is

2606.48 --> 2613.219
kind of out of the loop for me

2610.06 --> 2613.219
[Music]

2621.28 --> 2625.52
hmm okay terry yeah yeah take care yeah

2624.48 --> 2629.839
and yes

2625.52 --> 2629.839
i feel exactly every time i get sick

2630.88 --> 2634.56
then yeah

2632.16 --> 2637.359
i discuss it on on the show right when i

2634.56 --> 2640.88
get sick it's like my entire body's like

2637.359 --> 2640.88
there's like this mini war

2641.04 --> 2645.44
and then when it's over it's like

2643.2 --> 2648.72
everything is all cleared up i see clear

2645.44 --> 2650.079
i hear clear i feel more sharp

2648.72 --> 2652.319
all that

2650.079 --> 2654.88
sometimes like even my sense of smell

2652.319 --> 2657.599
just like becomes more enhanced all my

2654.88 --> 2660.88
centuries improve after i've been sick

2657.599 --> 2662.56
so yeah i totally get it tear it

2660.88 --> 2664.6400000000003
right

2662.56 --> 2668.2
just make sure you minimize the amount

2664.64 --> 2668.2
of pharmaceutical

2668.319 --> 2673.44
[ __ ] that you might take

2671.359 --> 2676.16
because that is definitely gonna burden

2673.44 --> 2677.839
any restoration process

2676.16 --> 2680.5699999999997
it's just gonna

2677.839 --> 2683.709
add to the toxicity

2680.57 --> 2683.7090000000003
[Music]

2684.8 --> 2688.52
three days hmm

2690.72 --> 2694.0789999999997
right so you got it pretty bad

2697.359 --> 2702.839
i was low on magnesium

2699.359 --> 2705.2
felt like total yeah lumpy get dude

2702.839 --> 2705.2
magnesium then

2706.72 --> 2711.9199999999996
it's very important stuff for me

2710.319 --> 2714.64
right

2711.92 --> 2717.04
i i take it every day

2714.64 --> 2719.44
it's not that expensive

2717.04 --> 2722.24
lasts very long

2719.44 --> 2724.56
it's not particularly yummy but it's not

2722.24 --> 2725.4399999999996
super disgusting either

2724.56 --> 2727.68
and

2725.44 --> 2730.2400000000002
it has all kinds of benefits

2727.68 --> 2732.319
like the most important thing that i

2730.24 --> 2733.7599999999998
discovered from it is that it literally

2732.319 --> 2738.4
helps

2733.76 --> 2741.599
like acute toothache things like like ah

2738.4 --> 2743.28
and then it's like uh quickly

2741.599 --> 2744.7200000000003
and

2743.28 --> 2746.88
it's just gone i mean it's not

2744.72 --> 2748.9599999999996
permanently gone but like it like

2746.88 --> 2751.76
instantly helps

2748.96 --> 2755.04
against like acute like nerve

2751.76 --> 2756.0
that sort of feeling that's amazing

2755.04 --> 2757.92
right

2756.0 --> 2760.15
and it's just good for the digestive

2757.92 --> 2761.44
system it calms everything down

2760.15 --> 2762.52
[Music]

2761.44 --> 2765.84
so yeah

2762.52 --> 2765.84
[Music]

2771.359 --> 2775.839
and valerian right

2772.96 --> 2775.839
you could use that

2777.359 --> 2783.44
lemon juice always good sunlight

2780.319 --> 2785.599
really that's weird i am depends like if

2783.44 --> 2788.64
you're already in the restoration like

2785.599 --> 2790.88
like when i was literally sick myself

2788.64 --> 2793.7599999999998
like when you're nauseated that then the

2790.88 --> 2796.6400000000003
sun is not all that great

2793.76 --> 2798.8
sometimes when i'm sick but afterward

2796.64 --> 2802.7599999999998
after that all is over then i definitely

2798.8 --> 2802.76
want to absorb some sun

2803.839 --> 2808.56
right but yeah that sounds sensible

2805.76 --> 2811.8390000000004
lemon juice and sleep

2808.56 --> 2811.839
sleep is very important

2813.04 --> 2816.319
also to

2814.16 --> 2818.24
make sure you don't get yourself

2816.319 --> 2819.839
stressed out about anything pretty much

2818.24 --> 2820.7999999999997
you might just let it

2819.839 --> 2823.44
let it

2820.8 --> 2825.52
let it flow past you you don't have time

2823.44 --> 2829.2400000000002
for that you don't have the

2825.52 --> 2829.24
energy to do that

2838.0 --> 2842.559
remember my previous no i what are your

2840.48 --> 2845.0
previous names

2842.559 --> 2848.6400000000003
but yes i do go back to pretty much

2845.0 --> 2848.64
2017. that's right

2849.28 --> 2853.52
i was there at the start with flutter's

2850.96 --> 2856.0
debate and i already was active before

2853.52 --> 2859.48
that with my own show

2856.0 --> 2859.48
letter talks

2877.119 --> 2880.8
too much heat strap well have you ever

2878.96 --> 2885.079
considered just

2880.8 --> 2885.079
wearing a good hat for that

2890.48 --> 2894.28
i was a phlegologist

2896.8 --> 2901.28
doesn't really ring a bell but

2899.04 --> 2903.359
then again especially in those early

2901.28 --> 2904.4100000000003
days in the chats there were like so

2903.359 --> 2906.72
many people like

2904.41 --> 2908.64
[Music]

2906.72 --> 2911.2799999999997
so many people coming by i might have

2908.64 --> 2913.92
seen you at some point but no it doesn't

2911.28 --> 2917.3190000000004
really let holo just doesn't really ring

2913.92 --> 2917.319
a bell sorry

2928.96 --> 2933.4
feel the detox happening within good

2944.559 --> 2948.8
okay thanks for that hill to the chef

2949.76 --> 2954.8390000000004
is that really true what you're saying

2951.839 --> 2954.839
there

2963.28 --> 2966.28

great

2982.92 --> 2985.969
[Music]

2986.48 --> 2992.44
yeah better stick the lumpy gas in a

2988.96 --> 2992.44
vacuum then

3008.96 --> 3013.2400000000002
oh my teeth hold on

3066.0 --> 3069.0
uh

3078.88 --> 3083.849
hey jarvis

3080.71 --> 3083.849
[Music]

3101.839 --> 3107.52
right yeah jarvis yeah

3104.16 --> 3107.52
things were different back then

3108.559 --> 3112.8
but

3109.28 --> 3112.8
that's always been happening

3115.92 --> 3121.839
right people come and go

3119.359 --> 3124.0
i mean it happens on kind of a yearly

3121.839 --> 3126.48
basis even

3124.0 --> 3128.72
people come in they're like oh yeah i

3126.48 --> 3130.4
wanna like be part of this and then

3128.72 --> 3133.1189999999997
after a while it's just like they're

3130.4 --> 3134.48
done and they're just like oh okay

3133.119 --> 3138.0
they're not gonna show up anymore

3134.48 --> 3139.68
they're just gonna do other stuff

3138.0 --> 3141.92
so

3139.68 --> 3145.44
but yeah look back in the day there was

3141.92 --> 3146.96
the whole supposed ranty community and

3145.44 --> 3149.68
[ __ ]

3146.96 --> 3152.4
from the flatter there was so there was

3149.68 --> 3153.44
a lot of fl randy did really in a way

3152.4 --> 3156.0
like

3153.44 --> 3158.7200000000003
wreck a whole bunch of [ __ ]

3156.0 --> 3162.0
because of what he did

3158.72 --> 3163.839
we had a really big group of very active

3162.0 --> 3165.92
people

3163.839 --> 3167.2
on the flat earth debate and he wrecked

3165.92 --> 3170.4
it

3167.2 --> 3170.3999999999996
he has done that

3173.04 --> 3178.079
right because that's not just

3176.0 --> 3178.839
on my channel that was also on the flat

3178.079 --> 3182.1600000000003
earth

3178.839 --> 3183.44
debates flattered debates chat was

3182.16 --> 3186.0789999999997
booming

3183.44 --> 3188.16
all the time

3186.079 --> 3190.2400000000002
but a lot of these people now they're

3188.16 --> 3191.5989999999997
all now in their own special boy clubs

3190.24 --> 3193.2799999999997
and they all think that flat earth

3191.599 --> 3195.119
debate is not good enough for them

3193.28 --> 3198.88
anymore

3195.119 --> 3202.599
so they all contracted cervonia syndrome

3198.88 --> 3202.599
to a certain degree

3210.96 --> 3214.559
and also a lot of flat earthers out

3212.96 --> 3215.839
there have just kind of moved on and

3214.559 --> 3218.48
they're just like

3215.839 --> 3221.04
hanging around doing their own thing

3218.48 --> 3224.0
not really developing or being really

3221.04 --> 3225.2
involved in anything big

3224.0 --> 3227.2
they're just

3225.2 --> 3230.64
hanging around

3227.2 --> 3233.4399999999996
a bev bev's try thinking channel is also

3230.64 --> 3235.2
very much like that

3233.44 --> 3237.68
just like yeah what are they really

3235.2 --> 3240.319
doing well nothing revolutionary i can

3237.68 --> 3240.319
tell you that

3241.05 --> 3246.92
[Music]

3247.04 --> 3252.48
right they all just scattered and and

3249.359 --> 3254.5589999999997
created their own safe spaces

3252.48 --> 3256.2400000000002
where they can be exactly on the level

3254.559 --> 3260.96
they want and not

3256.24 --> 3260.9599999999996
and not continue not be pushed to grow

3261.04 --> 3266.769
that's what they're doing

3263.57 --> 3266.7690000000002
[Music]

3269.22 --> 3273.16
[Music]

3273.52 --> 3276.52
what

3282.16 --> 3287.52
nobody goes to fed because it is in the

3284.319 --> 3289.119
debate now except it absolutely is a

3287.52 --> 3291.44
debate now

3289.119 --> 3293.359
it's a more debate than ever it's just

3291.44 --> 3295.2000000000003
that the typical

3293.359 --> 3298.72
tactics

3295.2 --> 3300.5589999999997
that we face have aggravated

3298.72 --> 3302.5589999999997
significantly

3300.559 --> 3304.88
so it doesn't really seem like a debate

3302.559 --> 3306.88
anymore because it's mostly just scatter

3304.88 --> 3311.359
gunning trying to distract away from

3306.88 --> 3311.359
critical facts being ignored

3312.72 --> 3319.2799999999997
so yeah it's not much of a debate if the

3315.44 --> 3320.4
opponents are constantly

3319.28 --> 3323.8390000000004
using

3320.4 --> 3325.6800000000003
political tactics

3323.839 --> 3327.7599999999998
then it doesn't really feel like a

3325.68 --> 3329.68
debate anymore

3327.76 --> 3335.8390000000004
it's just a waste of time

3329.68 --> 3335.839
like politics huh familiar perhaps

3339.52 --> 3344.4
but there is still debate going

3341.76 --> 3346.6400000000003
over at the flat earth debate plenty

3344.4 --> 3349.44
i mean there is going to be ether

3346.64 --> 3352.0
debates there already are

3349.44 --> 3353.68
it's going to continue right

3352.0 --> 3356.68
so we're going to get all these

3353.68 --> 3356.68
ethereans

3358.319 --> 3366.64
from the bob empire and all that

3363.04 --> 3366.64
bob empire and the wheelie

3366.72 --> 3369.5989999999997
and they're yeah

3368.079 --> 3371.52
that's gonna happen and it's gonna

3369.599 --> 3374.2400000000002
continue to happen again

3371.52 --> 3376.079
exactly as it has

3374.24 --> 3378.319
it's gonna get the same treatment as

3376.079 --> 3381.6800000000003
anti-flat earth

3378.319 --> 3384.799
because that is how far it's been pulled

3381.68 --> 3387.2
how far they dragged it on

3384.799 --> 3391.04
into the presuppositional

3387.2 --> 3393.7599999999998
right and there is so much to actually

3391.04 --> 3394.5589999999997
understand of what all of that is you

3393.76 --> 3397.5200000000004
see

3394.559 --> 3399.44
every time an aberration

3397.52 --> 3402.96
vortex wraps

3399.44 --> 3405.599
an aberration starts to like grab hold

3402.96 --> 3407.44
of a community of people of several

3405.599 --> 3409.92
minds that are then going to basically

3407.44 --> 3413.359
get together and do that

3409.92 --> 3417.119
then the aberration pulls you away

3413.359 --> 3419.92
it creates its own uniformity virtual

3417.119 --> 3423.2000000000003
uniformity within the information and

3419.92 --> 3426.48
then distracts the viewer

3423.2 --> 3428.24
from seeing what's actually all there

3426.48 --> 3432.079
around it

3428.24 --> 3434.64
yeah an aberration is yet another effect

3432.079 --> 3438.1600000000003
psychologically

3434.64 --> 3440.16
to distract you from that which

3438.16 --> 3443.92
probably is a little bit too much for

3440.16 --> 3446.0
you to handle in that very moment

3443.92 --> 3448.48
right and when something is too much for

3446.0 --> 3451.92
you to handle in any moment

3448.48 --> 3454.48
then any distraction becomes welcome

3451.92 --> 3456.319
what is more what is more distracting

3454.48 --> 3458.2400000000002
than an aberration that is highly

3456.319 --> 3460.96
suggestive

3458.24 --> 3463.5989999999997
that a whole bunch of people together

3460.96 --> 3466.559
all believe in and all

3463.599 --> 3468.6400000000003
build up on like oh we're gonna figure

3466.559 --> 3471.52
out what this is yeah yeah just like

3468.64 --> 3474.72
you're gonna figure out science of the

3471.52 --> 3477.2
globe right gonna build it together yeah

3474.72 --> 3479.2799999999997
it's exactly the same pattern

3477.2 --> 3481.839
it's an aberration

3479.28 --> 3483.92
and a very convenient distraction from

3481.839 --> 3485.7599999999998
reality you can't handle

3483.92 --> 3487.2000000000003
everybody does it and then you build

3485.76 --> 3489.8390000000004
together and then you believe you're

3487.2 --> 3490.72
actually building reality

3489.839 --> 3492.319
yeah

3490.72 --> 3494.8799999999997
isn't that addictive

3492.319 --> 3497.52
feeling like a god feeling like you're

3494.88 --> 3500.48
building the akashic library yeah you're

3497.52 --> 3502.64
not building the akashic library

3500.48 --> 3506.2400000000002
nobody builds the akashic library but

3502.64 --> 3509.04
god and he's already done it we're just

3506.24 --> 3509.04
digging through it

3509.359 --> 3513.2799999999997
but

3510.4 --> 3514.96
aberrations are not gonna help you

3513.28 --> 3517.92
understand

3514.96 --> 3522.16
just a distraction based on fallacy

3517.92 --> 3522.16
and you willingly ignoring that

3527.359 --> 3532.48
he just t backs no no it doesn't you're

3530.079 --> 3535.52
not just tea bags guys you expect that's

3532.48 --> 3540.799
ridiculous over generalization

3535.52 --> 3540.799
no nathan definitely still discusses

3542.0 --> 3547.44
asks really good questions

3545.52 --> 3549.92
it's just that yeah there's a lot of

3547.44 --> 3553.76
numpties out there and then

3549.92 --> 3556.16
what starts out decently and well

3553.76 --> 3557.76
well balanced and

3556.16 --> 3561.2
honest and

3557.76 --> 3563.76
will then eventually degenerate into

3561.2 --> 3566.72
somebody just bracing against nathan

3563.76 --> 3566.7200000000003
like an idiot

3567.599 --> 3571.92
instead of just

3569.28 --> 3573.3590000000004
just giving it because you don't have

3571.92 --> 3575.599
really a choice

3573.359 --> 3576.64
nathan is going to make you say

3575.599 --> 3578.799
something

3576.64 --> 3580.96
it's because it's true

3578.799 --> 3583.52
it's not about his ego it's about that

3580.96 --> 3584.559
it really is true

3583.52 --> 3587.44
and that

3584.559 --> 3590.079
it's really psycho that you're bracing

3587.44 --> 3590.079
against that

3591.28 --> 3594.559
and that's when he starts to teabag

3593.359 --> 3596.88
people

3594.559 --> 3598.4
it's because people keep bracing

3596.88 --> 3601.04
against him

3598.4 --> 3603.119
they should know better and sometimes

3601.04 --> 3604.96
people even brace against them and then

3603.119 --> 3607.599
realize what they did to themselves

3604.96 --> 3610.16
can't get out of it and then they get

3607.599 --> 3610.1600000000003
oh [ __ ]

3610.72 --> 3616.0
right because they know oh [ __ ] i

3613.44 --> 3618.2400000000002
literally stepped in quicksand and i'm

3616.0 --> 3621.599
sinking

3618.24 --> 3623.04
yeah that's what happens

3621.599 --> 3626.04
that's what happens on the flat earth

3623.04 --> 3626.04
debate

3631.82 --> 3635.1090000000004
[Music]

3654.16 --> 3661.2799999999997
they argue with comments yeah

3657.04 --> 3663.68
it it really does it becomes

3661.28 --> 3664.799
how you argue with the six-year-old

3663.68 --> 3667.7599999999998
child

3664.799 --> 3669.599
except the six-year-old child

3667.76 --> 3671.599
grew like

3669.599 --> 3673.76
20 years older

3671.599 --> 3676.4
without learning a single thing and

3673.76 --> 3678.3190000000004
still having the same mentality

3676.4 --> 3680.1600000000003
but with all the hormones and you're

3678.319 --> 3682.24
you're just gonna be like

3680.16 --> 3683.44
hello

3682.24 --> 3684.4799999999996
just

3683.44 --> 3688.7200000000003
learn

3684.48 --> 3691.839
listen to what i'm saying you idiot

3688.72 --> 3691.839
that's what happened then

3696.24 --> 3699.68
i mean you have to realize that these

3698.24 --> 3703.68
people

3699.68 --> 3706.319
that get on nathan's it is their

3703.68 --> 3708.5589999999997
choice it's their choice to be there

3706.319 --> 3711.68
nobody's forcing them to be there do you

3708.559 --> 3714.0
understand this is not nathan cornering

3711.68 --> 3715.2
somebody in a prison

3714.0 --> 3719.599
you see

3715.2 --> 3721.0389999999998
those people are there voluntarily

3719.599 --> 3723.52
they can

3721.039 --> 3724.7200000000003
if they chose so

3723.52 --> 3726.4
drop

3724.72 --> 3729.2799999999997
and leave

3726.4 --> 3729.28
but they don't

3730.64 --> 3733.5989999999997
yeah

3731.839 --> 3737.52
that's where the real

3733.599 --> 3740.88
real weirdness actually comes in

3737.52 --> 3741.7599999999998
they could leave but they don't

3740.88 --> 3744.799
but

3741.76 --> 3746.6400000000003
you you probably are kind of overlooking

3744.799 --> 3748.4
that fact

3746.64 --> 3750.64
when you're just rolling through it and

3748.4 --> 3752.88
watching it right you're not really

3750.64 --> 3755.2799999999997
consciously realizing that they could

3752.88 --> 3757.28
literally just realize like oh [ __ ] what

3755.28 --> 3760.2400000000002
have i got myself into

3757.28 --> 3762.7200000000003
i'm out of here this is this is fubar

3760.24 --> 3765.72
no they don't

3762.72 --> 3767.1189999999997
they keep going for an hour

3765.72 --> 3771.2
[Music]

3767.119 --> 3771.2000000000003
that's the real crazy part

3776.079 --> 3780.96
most people did eventually reap or they

3778.16 --> 3780.96
get kicked out

3781.119 --> 3784.96
some of them do just get kicked out by

3783.039 --> 3786.96
nathan because they should leave and

3784.96 --> 3789.96
they're just then hanging around the

3786.96 --> 3789.96
troll

3813.2 --> 3817.4399999999996
and god forbid they concede one point

3815.839 --> 3820.44
yeah

3817.44 --> 3820.44
right

3833.039 --> 3836.039
so

3843.2 --> 3848.52
god damn it

3845.2 --> 3848.52
it's off

3852.16 --> 3857.1189999999997
all right now i'm going after him now of

3854.559 --> 3858.7200000000003
course immediately he's completely

3857.119 --> 3861.6800000000003
disappeared

3858.72 --> 3864.839
i bet he's still here waiting for me to

3861.68 --> 3866.96
stop doing yeah there he

3864.839 --> 3869.44
is get

3866.96 --> 3869.44
out

3870.96 --> 3876.28
it's not beers

3873.28 --> 3876.28
yeah

3881.839 --> 3885.2
hey lsg good to see you

3886.96 --> 3891.599
yeah lumpy gas in the back yeah which it

3888.88 --> 3894.0
did sound horrible in the end

3891.599 --> 3896.559
but he had that giggle moment too where

3894.0 --> 3900.0
he was realizing like oh [ __ ] i'm in

3896.559 --> 3901.52
over my head but he he wouldn't let go

3900.0 --> 3905.119
and then he turned into like an

3901.52 --> 3907.28
anti-flat earther or a bob earther

3905.119 --> 3909.44
they they all have it

3907.28 --> 3911.599
they don't let go have their pride and

3909.44 --> 3915.92
they won't let go they won't be they

3911.599 --> 3918.96
won't have any humility they just want

3915.92 --> 3920.88
they're like no i'd rather die

3918.96 --> 3923.28
than have humanity

3920.88 --> 3924.88
and then they become

3923.28 --> 3927.44
like anti-flat earth this is kind of

3924.88 --> 3927.44
demonic

3929.359 --> 3934.64
they change like the energy that

3932.559 --> 3938.079
that they have when they communicate

3934.64 --> 3940.16
then changes from that point

3938.079 --> 3942.96
until they drop

3940.16 --> 3942.96
it's what happens

3946.96 --> 3949.96
dude

3957.119 --> 3961.599
oh they banned you too lumpy yes

3959.92 --> 3964.599
yeah i guess they ban a whole bunch of

3961.599 --> 3964.599
people

3965.52 --> 3971.68
i don't go there anymore

3967.52 --> 3973.839
24 7 discord flat earth is

3971.68 --> 3975.839
it's like the woke

3973.839 --> 3976.88
flat earth show now or something like

3975.839 --> 3980.24
they're just

3976.88 --> 3982.559
not not literally but they are like just

3980.24 --> 3983.9199999999996
turning it into stupid little safe space

3982.559 --> 3986.3190000000004
and just banning everybody and

3983.92 --> 3986.319
everything

3986.64 --> 3992.92
including like prominent people

3989.2 --> 3992.9199999999996
for petty reasons

4006.64 --> 4009.85
[Music]

4015.68 --> 4020.19
qe is getting muted

4018.4 --> 4023.26
on 24 7. yeah

4020.19 --> 4023.26
[Music]

4024.64 --> 4027.68
now they everyone

4031.28 --> 4034.92
they'll mute anybody

4037.58 --> 4040.8489999999997
[Music]

4051.839 --> 4055.0389999999998
right yeah that's well that's what

4053.52 --> 4058.24
happened to me too

4055.039 --> 4060.0
i snapped at a moderator

4058.24 --> 4061.4399999999996
apparently he wasn't water i didn't even

4060.0 --> 4065.28
realize that

4061.44 --> 4065.28
in like a discord chat thing

4066.799 --> 4072.0
you basically like

4069.359 --> 4074.5589999999997
yeah was just being a dick

4072.0 --> 4076.079
then i spoke up about it

4074.559 --> 4078.3190000000004
on the live show because it was

4076.079 --> 4082.079
literally there and snapped at him

4078.319 --> 4084.24
basically saying he was a piece of [ __ ]

4082.079 --> 4085.599
and then they're like oh you can't talk

4084.24 --> 4087.4399999999996
about

4085.599 --> 4089.44
you shouldn't talk about him like that

4087.44 --> 4090.88
and like no he's acting like a piece of

4089.44 --> 4092.16
[ __ ]

4090.88 --> 4094.559
totally

4092.16 --> 4096.639999999999
like using his like a sort of boomer

4094.559 --> 4097.92
privilege situation or something he just

4096.64 --> 4100.0
thought that he

4097.92 --> 4102.159
that you could just do that

4100.0 --> 4103.839
just censor people

4102.159 --> 4107.44
that are actually trying to seriously

4103.839 --> 4107.44
communicate and not be a troll

4108.08 --> 4112.48
and then when i continued to be pissed

4110.4 --> 4114.0
off over that then they just kicked me

4112.48 --> 4116.718999999999
out

4114.0 --> 4116.719
like okay

4116.799 --> 4122.08
burn burden helen

4120.08 --> 4125.92
that's how you're gonna be

4122.08 --> 4127.839
you can be it on your own

4125.92 --> 4131.799
no longer subscribed i'm not gonna

4127.839 --> 4131.799
advertise for it anymore

4132.719 --> 4136.719
i've had too many terrible experiences

4135.04 --> 4139.04
there anyway a couple of good

4136.719 --> 4142.319
conversations sometimes i there's people

4139.04 --> 4144.239
in there that actually respected me

4142.319 --> 4147.120000000001
but other times it's just like these

4144.239 --> 4149.678999999999
goofy people they're just like

4147.12 --> 4151.44
that are bored like they're bored and

4149.679 --> 4153.359
they act bored

4151.44 --> 4156.0
but they still like feel like they have

4153.359 --> 4156.0
this power

4156.319 --> 4162.080000000001
to like oh somebody's complaining we

4159.12 --> 4164.239
don't want to hear about that now

4162.08 --> 4165.2789999999995
so we're just going to mute you or

4164.239 --> 4167.599999999999
something

4165.279 --> 4167.6
dude

4169.359 --> 4172.08
it's a waste of

4172.839 --> 4180.08
time had some good moments there

4175.839 --> 4180.08
but that's not the that's over

4181.92 --> 4185.359
there are good people there yeah well

4183.359 --> 4188.359
those good people can go somewhere else

4185.359 --> 4188.359
then

4188.799 --> 4193.5199999999995
because the shitty people are obviously

4190.88 --> 4193.52
staying there

4200.0 --> 4204.4
good point there

4201.52 --> 4204.400000000001
need hugger

4204.64 --> 4209.12
they would not be bored if they studied

4207.199 --> 4211.759999999999
signs and natural laws

4209.12 --> 4211.76
that's right

4213.28 --> 4218.32
but they don't really they don't go over

4216.159 --> 4220.08
it they don't train it like over at the

4218.32 --> 4222.0
flat earth debates

4220.08 --> 4223.04
so yeah they're just going to be hanging

4222.0 --> 4225.76
around

4223.04 --> 4225.76
being bored

4229.52 --> 4236.400000000001
the ether stuff is mainstream baller bs

4232.56 --> 4238.400000000001
i don't know if it is jeff gassett

4236.4 --> 4241.36
but then again ether is such a

4238.4 --> 4243.679
convoluted subject because like what

4241.36 --> 4245.92
which ether

4243.679 --> 4248.88
i mean there's so many ethers it's it's

4245.92 --> 4248.88
just ridiculous

4251.76 --> 4257.280000000001
replacement for gravity well yes

4255.199 --> 4261.839999999999
the

4257.28 --> 4264.08
universal ether theory right the one

4261.84 --> 4266.32
that's not just oh yeah ether that's the

4264.08 --> 4268.64
medium for light because we're gonna

4266.32 --> 4270.96
presuppose it's a wave

4268.64 --> 4272.88
right not because that's really the main

4270.96 --> 4276.0
functionary problem

4272.88 --> 4277.52
of ether within physics

4276.0 --> 4280.48
main beef of

4277.52 --> 4284.320000000001
quantum eraser john as well

4280.48 --> 4286.879999999999
right the problem is it's gotten worse

4284.32 --> 4289.679
it seems like i don't know if it was

4286.88 --> 4291.92
literally him

4289.679 --> 4294.08
but it seems like it because of that

4291.92 --> 4295.12
same techno bubble it's the ken wheeler

4294.08 --> 4297.92
method

4295.12 --> 4301.04
it's taken like all the ethers and then

4297.92 --> 4302.719
spun it into a wheelie and now suddenly

4301.04 --> 4305.68
all the ethers is everything in this

4302.719 --> 4306.96
counter space and it's muffins and

4305.68 --> 4308.56
[Music]

4306.96 --> 4310.4
like what the hell

4308.56 --> 4313.6
like what isn't either it's the electric

4310.4 --> 4316.4
ether it is the the non-existent

4313.6 --> 4319.04
potential it is the counter space is

4316.4 --> 4322.32
like dude that's

4319.04 --> 4322.32
that's ridiculous

4322.56 --> 4327.4400000000005
so it has in that sense very much become

4325.36 --> 4330.5599999999995
like gravity which is

4327.44 --> 4331.5199999999995
an aberration in which several different

4330.56 --> 4333.52
things

4331.52 --> 4336.080000000001
little effects that are

4333.52 --> 4338.4800000000005
taken note off in the physical world are

4336.08 --> 4340.48
all scraped together and then based on

4338.48 --> 4344.879999999999
the presupposition

4340.48 --> 4347.199
claimed to be all caused by this thing

4344.88 --> 4349.36
a force that isn't actually a force

4347.199 --> 4350.96
which you could think of it as a force

4349.36 --> 4352.5599999999995
and it's actually something that takes

4350.96 --> 4356.12
place in a conceptual medium that

4352.56 --> 4356.120000000001
doesn't really exist

4358.4 --> 4362.879999999999
and in that sense the universal ether

4360.96 --> 4364.64
theory i'm going to call it now

4362.88 --> 4367.52
is almost

4364.64 --> 4368.84
exactly the same pattern as gravity it's

4367.52 --> 4372.400000000001
very

4368.84 --> 4375.04
similar an aberration i mean ether in

4372.4 --> 4377.5199999999995
that sense is an aberration the light

4375.04 --> 4378.32
ether is already an aberration on its

4377.52 --> 4381.120000000001
own

4378.32 --> 4384.0
but especially this widely

4381.12 --> 4387.44
knit in together everything is ether

4384.0 --> 4388.4
universal ether theory is

4387.44 --> 4392.08
is

4388.4 --> 4394.0
very very much an aberration

4392.08 --> 4395.76
it's one of those mind twist ghosts

4394.0 --> 4399.84
that's just going to keep on luring and

4395.76 --> 4399.84
calling and you'll never get a result

4406.4 --> 4410.719
what asset was the first the proposed

4409.28 --> 4415.28
ether no

4410.719 --> 4417.76
no tesla talked about the electric ether

4415.28 --> 4420.32
he didn't talk about light medium either

4417.76 --> 4420.320000000001
electric

4420.719 --> 4423.04
right

4421.92 --> 4424.56
light

4423.04 --> 4427.6
ether

4424.56 --> 4430.88
came out of

4427.6 --> 4434.159000000001
quantum mechanics

4430.88 --> 4436.2390000000005
that's where the idea was spawned and

4434.159 --> 4438.159
countered and then

4436.239 --> 4441.839999999999
popularly

4438.159 --> 4441.839999999999
it was still embraced

4443.36 --> 4447.759999999999
tesla was not about light ether it was

4446.08 --> 4449.36
about the electric ether it's a

4447.76 --> 4450.88
completely different thing right and

4449.36 --> 4452.799999999999
then don't forget there's also a

4450.88 --> 4455.4400000000005
chemical called ether

4452.8 --> 4458.400000000001
and then there's the alchemy

4455.44 --> 4461.5199999999995
element called ether

4458.4 --> 4464.879999999999
and then there's the spirit ether and

4461.52 --> 4467.6
then do like ether ether ether ether

4464.88 --> 4470.4800000000005
there's so many ethers like

4467.6 --> 4472.2390000000005
who invented the ether

4470.48 --> 4474.08
uh

4472.239 --> 4476.159
god

4474.08 --> 4479.12
like

4476.159 --> 4480.879999999999
ether is a very widespread word

4479.12 --> 4482.96
throughout history

4480.88 --> 4486.32
is attain all kinds of

4482.96 --> 4486.32
important positions

4487.04 --> 4489.84
in the lingo

4494.64 --> 4500.719
ether like hologram nonsense what the

4497.679 --> 4500.719
hell are you talking about

4503.92 --> 4508.64
what the hell is an ether like hologram

4506.4 --> 4510.08
supposed to be

4508.64 --> 4513.08
catchy inspector what are you talking

4510.08 --> 4513.08
about

4550.84 --> 4555.76
what what are you talking about ayah

4553.36 --> 4555.759999999999
walks

4564.64 --> 4570.56
yeah lumpy guests please take care of

4566.719 --> 4570.56
that caps don't do that

4571.12 --> 4575.599999999999
lumpy

4572.96 --> 4579.719
don't go captain

4575.6 --> 4579.719
don't caption in my chat

4582.96 --> 4586.679
get the point though

4600.4 --> 4605.5199999999995
you've seen it with the eye okay well

4602.64 --> 4607.12
everything you described there is not

4605.52 --> 4609.6
visual

4607.12 --> 4612.96
so none of it makes sense especially if

4609.6 --> 4612.96
you claim to see it

4615.92 --> 4620.84
nothing you said made sense iowaks

4618.96 --> 4625.719
nothing about

4620.84 --> 4625.719
it incoherent rambling

4639.84 --> 4643.4400000000005
what is in a vacuum chamber

4647.28 --> 4651.8
yeah

4648.8 --> 4651.8
air

4653.36 --> 4658.719
if there is no anything that's right

4655.44 --> 4660.0
ether is the claim that something has to

4658.719 --> 4662.2390000000005
be there

4660.0 --> 4664.64
when there is nothing there

4662.239 --> 4665.44
it is the something that is claimed to

4664.64 --> 4667.92
be

4665.44 --> 4670.799999999999
there where nothing is

4667.92 --> 4673.96
it's complete cuckoo

4670.8 --> 4673.96
it's just

4679.6 --> 4684.08
all right i mean oh ether is the thing

4684.159 --> 4687.36
that is there

4687.76 --> 4692.8
where there is nothing it's the thing

4690.64 --> 4694.719
that is there

4692.8 --> 4696.4800000000005
where is nothing

4694.719 --> 4699.04
right so it's the

4696.48 --> 4699.04
the thing

4699.44 --> 4704.159
in the presumed location

4702.0 --> 4704.84
of nothingness

4704.159 --> 4706.48
i

4704.84 --> 4710.1990000000005
mean

4706.48 --> 4710.199
this is not an exaggeration

4724.96 --> 4729.28
what the [ __ ] are you talking about

4726.8 --> 4729.28
gadget

4730.32 --> 4735.599999999999
are you trying to [ __ ] on my non-local

4733.28 --> 4738.8
holographic celestial theory what the

4735.6 --> 4738.8
hell are you blabbering

4739.36 --> 4744.199
are you acting out in a french mood

4741.199 --> 4744.199
again

4750.0 --> 4754.08
i'd say i didn't give a [ __ ] about your

4752.0 --> 4757.8
opinion if i understood what the [ __ ]

4754.08 --> 4757.8
you were talking about

4774.56 --> 4780.719
yeah [ __ ] off dude

4777.199 --> 4782.32
stick your techno babble fantasmia

4780.719 --> 4786.4800000000005
[ __ ]

4782.32 --> 4788.88
up your ass take it somewhere else

4786.48 --> 4791.04
go write your ridiculous nihilist

4788.88 --> 4793.36
science fiction book somewhere else dick

4791.04 --> 4793.36
wad

4798.96 --> 4804.13
oh [ __ ] illegal

4800.94 --> 4804.129999999999
[Music]

4806.88 --> 4811.1990000000005
god

4808.88 --> 4813.4400000000005
no i haven't watched it yet

4811.199 --> 4816.44
i don't believe i actually forgot it

4813.44 --> 4816.44
again

4836.56 --> 4842.320000000001
i'm just gonna look at it

4838.8 --> 4842.320000000001
oh it's not even that long

4844.32 --> 4850.159
screw it i'm just gonna play it i'm just

4846.56 --> 4850.159000000001
gonna play it live on my show

4854.56 --> 4859.639
it's not even

4856.239 --> 4859.638999999999
that short

4864.239 --> 4869.879999999999
i think i might have seen it before by

4866.8 --> 4869.88
the way

4874.88 --> 4877.1990000000005
okay

4878.32 --> 4881.32
great

4895.52 --> 4897.92
right

4898.0 --> 4903.84
no sound though

4899.76 --> 4903.84
i don't even know if there is any sound

4933.36 --> 4935.839999999999
okay

4942.239 --> 4945.239
hmm

4964.96 --> 4967.96
huh

5001.6 --> 5003.84
whoa

5004.56 --> 5009.56
okay that's this could get freaky

5029.36 --> 5031.679
huh

5035.679 --> 5040.0
wow dude this is trippy man

5038.159 --> 5040.839999999999
it's fascinating to see you like what

5040.0 --> 5046.04
they're

5040.84 --> 5046.04
doing it's very mathematical

5059.679 --> 5062.4
thank you for that

5068.48 --> 5073.919999999999

5070.88 --> 5077.56

5073.92 --> 5077.56
and thanks for sharing

5090.96 --> 5094.02
[Music]

5095.679 --> 5099.0
hey man

5124.84 --> 5129.76
man oh this hold on i gotta get us i'm

5128.4 --> 5134.12
gonna

5129.76 --> 5134.12
catch some of this wind this is amazing

5140.0 --> 5143.0
um

5155.92 --> 5158.639
man

5156.719 --> 5162.639
this would probably be amazing weather

5158.639 --> 5165.639
for like surfing and that kind of thing

5162.639 --> 5165.639
windsurfing

5170.32 --> 5175.799999999999
i actually know how to do that

5172.48 --> 5175.799999999999
with surfing

5195.12 --> 5199.84
outside

5196.639 --> 5199.84
what outside

5200.32 --> 5203.679
there's no outside

5205.28 --> 5210.96
if there would be an outside the

5207.12 --> 5212.48
firmament then it's not the firmament

5210.96 --> 5215.92
or the barrier

5212.48 --> 5215.919999999999
because then it is open

5216.0 --> 5223.199
the barrier that enables the gas within

5219.52 --> 5226.4800000000005
the realm to be pressurized has to be

5223.199 --> 5226.48
fully closed

5230.96 --> 5237.52
there's a way through then that means

5233.199 --> 5238.4
that it isn't actually the barrier

5237.52 --> 5240.719
because

5238.4 --> 5240.719
yeah

5241.12 --> 5245.04
i mean

5242.88 --> 5247.28
do i have to explain it and well i'm not

5245.04 --> 5250.28
gonna it's it should be extremely

5247.28 --> 5250.28
obvious

5262.639 --> 5267.08
why are you saying am i muted

5277.76 --> 5283.679
why are you spamming the same [ __ ] in my

5279.6 --> 5283.679

5293.04 --> 5297.679
not one flutter knows everything oh no

5296.48 --> 5300.48

5297.679 --> 5300.4800000000005
another point

5300.88 --> 5304.639
no bowler

5302.4 --> 5307.199

5304.639 --> 5309.679
how about that huh

5307.199 --> 5313.5199999999995
yeah oh no flutter knows everything yeah

5309.679 --> 5316.1990000000005
yeah no baller knows anything

5313.52 --> 5321.0
that's my rebuttal oh you know stupid

5316.199 --> 5321.0
presuppositional [ __ ] math

5323.679 --> 5328.8
i'm not a baller yeah

5326.0 --> 5331.96

[Music]

5342.239 --> 5345.839999999999
nobody gives a [ __ ] lumpy

5344.639 --> 5348.0

5345.84 --> 5351.12
people with wrenches here don't time

5348.0 --> 5354.08
other people out

5351.12 --> 5356.239
unless they are obvious sock trolls

5354.08 --> 5359.6
you understand because that's forbidden

5356.239 --> 5362.159
to do that it's forbidden in my chat

5359.6 --> 5364.159000000001
to use wrenches like that

5362.159 --> 5367.199
so it's kind of ridiculous for you to

5364.159 --> 5369.679
literally spam am i muted i mean don't

5367.199 --> 5369.678999999999
do that

5372.639 --> 5377.52
if you're going to be timed out

5374.719 --> 5377.52
by somebody

5377.6 --> 5382.159000000001
outside of my attention you're gonna get

5379.679 --> 5383.1990000000005
my attention i'm gonna talk about it

5382.159 --> 5386.969999999999
okay

5383.199 --> 5390.199
you're not so don't be ridiculous

5419.199 --> 5423.599999999999
dude lumpy if you get muted in a youtube

5422.639 --> 5427.52
chat

5423.6 --> 5427.52
your messages disappear

5427.679 --> 5431.08
this is ridiculous

5442.08 --> 5446.159
why would someone why would he even

5444.08 --> 5448.719
think that he would be muted if your

5446.159 --> 5452.719
messages are not disappearing this is

5448.719 --> 5452.719
ridiculous why would you think that

5453.12 --> 5457.36
i mean you don't have to have a wrench

5455.12 --> 5460.36
to see when your messages are getting

5457.36 --> 5460.36
deleted

5468.4 --> 5475.4
and when somebody times you out

5471.6 --> 5475.400000000001
all the messages disappear

5486.0 --> 5489.52
yeah you are

5487.52 --> 5493.1990000000005
take it easy bro

5489.52 --> 5496.0
cool it down make sure you stay hydrated

5493.199 --> 5496.0
it's not a joke

5496.159 --> 5500.239
if you're if you're dehydrated in the

5498.08 --> 5501.04
heat and you get over excited you could

5500.239 --> 5503.44
like

5501.04 --> 5506.0
get like borderline hallucination

5503.44 --> 5507.919999999999
weirdness so be careful with that or

5506.0 --> 5509.52
you're gonna end up rambling like a

5507.92 --> 5512.84
crazy person

5509.52 --> 5512.84
stay hydrated

5532.239 --> 5535.199
over

5533.199 --> 5539.879999999999
time has flown

5535.199 --> 5539.879999999999

5563.679 --> 5567.6
even my keyboard is back to normal

5565.84 --> 5571.12
what's going on

5567.6 --> 5574.92
yesterday my keyboard was all going nuts

5571.12 --> 5574.92
like i had to learn

5577.76 --> 5582.400000000001
it's like what

5580.159 --> 5584.32
it's working

5582.4 --> 5585.92
why was it doing it yesterday like that

5584.32 --> 5588.92
and now it's just like nothing ever

5585.92 --> 5588.92
happened

5593.13 --> 5599.34
[Music]

5614.159 --> 5618.239
right so i just gave this show a title

5618.639 --> 5623.8
to fit

5620.56 --> 5623.8
the mood

5630.159 --> 5636.08
at state heights was actually a very

5632.239 --> 5637.28
serious uh piece of advice jarvis

5636.08 --> 5639.199
i mean

5637.28 --> 5641.599999999999
yeah

5639.199 --> 5644.638999999999
it's very hot in a whole bunch of places

5641.6 --> 5646.4800000000005
in the united states and europe and

5644.639 --> 5648.400000000001
people forget

5646.48 --> 5650.5599999999995
sitting behind their computer or even

5648.4 --> 5651.679
staring into my mobile getting all

5650.56 --> 5654.080000000001
invested

5651.679 --> 5656.4800000000005
they forget

5654.08 --> 5659.84
and then if you get dehydrated you can

5656.48 --> 5662.159
literally just not realize it

5659.84 --> 5664.8
and then you'll start to get like weird

5662.159 --> 5667.199
paranoia or confusion like that there

5664.8 --> 5668.719
might be some weird dislocation of what

5667.199 --> 5669.919999999999
you're saying

5668.719 --> 5673.12
that happens

5669.92 --> 5674.96
because of dehydration

5673.12 --> 5678.0
it's not a joke

5674.96 --> 5681.28
you gotta be careful

5678.0 --> 5684.08
hydrating now yep okay well beard

5681.28 --> 5687.44
it's not exactly the best way to do that

5684.08 --> 5689.36
broken bullet but fair enough

5687.44 --> 5691.759999999999
cheers
