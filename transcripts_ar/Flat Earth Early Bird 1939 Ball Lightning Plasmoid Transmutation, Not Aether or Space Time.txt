see

32.82 --> 37.59
[Music]

46.32 --> 51.359
good morning welcome to Flat Earth early

49.76 --> 54.68
bird number

51.359 --> 56.440000000000005
1939 I'm your host Arwin and before I

54.68 --> 59.239
start the show please don't forget to

56.44 --> 61.718999999999994

66.08 --> 71.08
normally 2:00 p.m. Amsterdam time every

68.32 --> 73.08
day and please also do support me

71.08 --> 74.67999999999999
through the PayPal and the patreon that

73.08 --> 76.64
would be much appreciated and can always

74.68 --> 79.159
use the support so please keep it coming

76.64 --> 79.159
that would be

79.4 --> 85.479
great right weather today

82.4 --> 88.52000000000001
is mixed it was kind of Sunny earlier

85.479 --> 91.92
but now there big clouds over there

88.52 --> 91.92
moving in

99.32 --> 103.6
oh maybe they're moving past I'm not

101.88 --> 105.03999999999999
entirely sure I don't really see the

103.6 --> 108.0
clouds

105.04 --> 111.32000000000001
moving this

108.0 --> 111.32
direction we'll

112.92 --> 117.119
see all right

125.759 --> 135.04
right so low Moxy first in

129.52 --> 135.04000000000002
chat it is Sunday the 5th of May

141.16 --> 149.959
2024 temperature 17°

144.84 --> 149.959
Celsius 57% humidity

153.84 --> 158.48
the forecast for next week is all really

156.08 --> 161.56
warm and sunny

158.48 --> 163.959
now looking forward to that although

161.56 --> 168.8
yeah it keeps changing around I

163.959 --> 168.8
mean whatever you never really

172.519 --> 176.519
know right

181.16 --> 184.72
[Applause]

182.4 --> 188.4
yeah I want to shout out my patreon

184.72 --> 191.879
supporters got my patreon in Nathan R

188.4 --> 193.4
Banta and skeptic 936 really appreciate

191.879 --> 196.79899999999998
your monthly

193.4 --> 199.56
support every little bit helps hope to

196.799 --> 203.72
get some more patreons

199.56 --> 203.72
in but yeah I thank you for your

208.28 --> 211.76
support uh

212.959 --> 218.76
yeah certainly got us an interesting

215.599 --> 218.76
subject on the menu

220.4 --> 226.08
today it's all pretty

223.48 --> 228.84
heavy right so yeah

226.08 --> 234.4
uh I got Dave Weiss on on the nightow

228.84 --> 238.72
show he basically linked me up with this

234.4 --> 238.72
video let's see

240.519 --> 246.0
it

241.92 --> 248.67999999999998
back about plasmoids ball

246.0 --> 251.959
lightning and

248.68 --> 254.15900000000002
transmutation and yeah it was a 2hour

251.959 --> 255.4
video some of you might have watched it

254.159 --> 257.599
some of you might have already known

255.4 --> 257.599
about

257.68 --> 263.759
it last

260.28 --> 265.67999999999995
Friday but yesterday I did watch the

263.759 --> 269.12
whole

265.68 --> 270.32
thing from beginning to end and it was

269.12 --> 272.68
indeed

270.32 --> 272.68
very

276.759 --> 282.36
fascinating triggered all kinds of

278.759 --> 285.12
memories from my past

282.36 --> 288.16
cuz I learned about this

285.12 --> 290.8
before except yeah not through an

288.16 --> 290.8
elaborate

290.84 --> 295.56
presentation basically somebody just

292.96 --> 295.56
talking about

296.08 --> 302.479
it but yeah through the alchemical

299.08 --> 305.19899999999996
science Channel they have very elaborate

302.479 --> 307.71999999999997
detailed presentations including like

305.199 --> 309.91900000000004
device schematics and all that

307.72 --> 312.56
explaining the whole process and it is

309.919 --> 312.56
quite

313.16 --> 317.08000000000004
elaborate but uh yeah I'm uh I'm

316.16 --> 321.72
watching

317.08 --> 321.71999999999997
it is really interesting

343.919 --> 348.24
right so I'm currently watching this

346.6 --> 351.40000000000003
video from that

348.24 --> 353.56
channel and

351.4 --> 358.63899999999995
halfway probably going to watch more of

353.56 --> 362.759
that stuff I mean I do feel like

358.639 --> 367.40000000000003
I'm I'm starting to figure it out

362.759 --> 371.68
already it is decently well

367.4 --> 374.71999999999997
explained but as is to be

371.68 --> 376.88
expected some people in these videos

374.72 --> 380.0
that this guy seems to like fully be on

376.88 --> 383.759
board with are

380.0 --> 383.759
like Ken wheeler

383.919 --> 391.56
followers which is an obvious warning

387.88 --> 391.56
signal of course

393.28 --> 398.19899999999996
and yeah within their

395.84 --> 400.0
engineering they draw in certain

398.199 --> 403.24
terminologies that

400.0 --> 403.24
are to

405.8 --> 412.199
me misleading names that are probably

410.319 --> 415.44
drawn from

412.199 --> 420.68
the spirit of the

415.44 --> 420.68
times in the naming process

421.08 --> 429.15999999999997
and this is very typical because that's

423.84 --> 432.599
the same kind of process that led to

429.16 --> 436.24
how light is being explained especially

432.599 --> 438.919
like the changing of the speed of light

436.24 --> 442.28000000000003
in order to have the light have a

438.919 --> 444.56
different effect right they presuppose

442.28 --> 447.4
it has a speed and then they presuppose

444.56 --> 451.72
that the speed is changed in order to

447.4 --> 454.56
provide the effect and that is a thing

451.72 --> 456.28000000000003
that's just now inherent in light

454.56 --> 458.759
engineering like everybody just

456.28 --> 462.4
describes it like that even though light

458.759 --> 464.639
technically doesn't have a speed that's

462.4 --> 467.039
measured right it's just being

464.639 --> 469.52
presupposed and it seems like in the

467.039 --> 473.12
transmutation process or the chart

469.52 --> 473.12
somebody made this incredible

473.479 --> 480.96
chart they've done the same thing not

476.52 --> 484.79999999999995
with light but in this case

480.96 --> 487.19899999999996
SpaceTime they they weirdly draw in the

484.8 --> 490.96000000000004
idea of space and

487.199 --> 494.639
time being fluid space is time time is

490.96 --> 496.19899999999996
space I mean it is pretty ridiculous

494.639 --> 499.159
that they do

496.199 --> 500.96000000000004
that it is very etherite it's very Ken

499.159 --> 502.71999999999997
wheeler in origin and everybody just

500.96 --> 505.75899999999996
seems to stick with it and be really

502.72 --> 508.47900000000004
impressed by that even though to me like

505.759 --> 510.40000000000003
that is clearly a sign that they're

508.479 --> 513.3199999999999
getting distracted

510.4 --> 516.3199999999999
by Illusions like aberration

513.32 --> 521.8000000000001
aberrational thinking

516.32 --> 528.72
but I mean the Practical results are

521.8 --> 528.7199999999999
there but there is a a more logical

528.92 --> 537.24
way to designate these

533.76 --> 539.519
traits and not through space and time

537.24 --> 543.5600000000001
because that is just like it is

539.519 --> 546.2
literally nonsensical you can't prove it

543.56 --> 549.68
right I mean time technically isn't the

546.2 --> 555.0790000000001
thing passage of time is something but

549.68 --> 555.079
what is it well it's like entropic

557.04 --> 564.8389999999999
consistency that's as far as it

560.48 --> 567.36
goes right the idea of oh we rapidly age

564.839 --> 569.2
something through some influence well no

567.36 --> 571.12
time doesn't literally pass quicker

569.2 --> 573.6400000000001
there

571.12 --> 575.68
is just that the typical influences of

573.64 --> 579.519
the passage of time which are due to

575.68 --> 583.399
entropy might be

579.519 --> 583.399
accelerated right

584.36 --> 591.76
so I've already in my mind basically

588.0 --> 595.16
figured out a way to redefine the ways

591.76 --> 597.3199999999999
that yeah this technology is being this

595.16 --> 600.48
transmutation technology which is what

597.32 --> 604.0790000000001
it is it's becoming very

600.48 --> 606.44
reliable very welldeveloped

604.079 --> 608.5999999999999
apparently there's a way better way to

606.44 --> 611.2
explain it I mean it it doesn't really

608.6 --> 613.0
take away from the incredible

611.2 --> 618.0
development of

613.0 --> 622.24
it it's just that the naming that they

618.0 --> 626.48
done is very much seems inspired by the

622.24 --> 630.0790000000001
spirit of the times than

626.48 --> 633.6
engineering probably by

630.079 --> 638.76
Einstein I mean why else would

633.6 --> 640.88
you draw in SpaceTime within like an

638.76 --> 643.8
engineering diagram like

640.88 --> 648.279
that it's the only

643.8 --> 652.8
reason and like even things like local

648.279 --> 655.8
gravity and all that it is full of the

652.8 --> 655.8
typical

655.88 --> 660.279
phrases

657.399 --> 664.6
which like that does take take away from

660.279 --> 667.519
the the logic of it in a way but I mean

664.6 --> 669.639
it's it's what they do with the

667.519 --> 671.24
description of the

669.639 --> 675.519
actual

671.24 --> 677.76
practical application of yeah of their

675.519 --> 680.32
findings the

677.76 --> 682.8
research so it is really the naming

680.32 --> 687.2
process that is the issue

682.8 --> 687.1999999999999
mostly that is like slightly

687.72 --> 693.48
misleading but I mean the results are

690.0 --> 698.639
the results and the diagrams are

693.48 --> 701.0790000000001
functional and will yield like over time

698.639 --> 704.04
more ability to really control the

701.079 --> 704.04
transmutation

707.12 --> 710.8
processes Hello Steven

712.6 --> 716.0
Jarvis yeah

716.44 --> 721.24
whatever it's just an example Stephen

718.959 --> 721.2399999999999
jar

721.72 --> 726.72
the naming

723.48 --> 730.5600000000001
issue presupposing claims that you then

726.72 --> 734.399
use in balanced diagrams it all work out

730.56 --> 738.6389999999999
within the diagram but you can't prove

734.399 --> 742.36
space or time is a

738.639 --> 744.8
thing you can prove however is that

742.36 --> 750.12
substances are

744.8 --> 753.92
being subjected to force extremities of

750.12 --> 756.72
sorts and that that basically starts

753.92 --> 760.079
this transformation

756.72 --> 762.6
process that is like even explicable

760.079 --> 766.68
like how that works they describe a lot

762.6 --> 766.6800000000001
of detail on this in the

769.04 --> 772.04
videos

773.519 --> 778.519
and I've actually been thinking of just

776.32 --> 779.9590000000001
like playing parts of some of these

778.519 --> 783.8
videos

779.959 --> 783.8
and like rephrasing

783.839 --> 788.839
it because what yeah I mean what they

787.6 --> 791.88
talk about

788.839 --> 794.2790000000001
is those are real processes it's just

791.88 --> 795.24
that the the ways they Define it they

794.279 --> 798.72
explain

795.24 --> 801.44
it through space and time makes it more

798.72 --> 808.5600000000001
confusing makes it more oh

801.44 --> 808.5600000000001
special more SCI fiish but not logical

812.6 --> 815.9200000000001
hello fibro good to see

816.199 --> 821.8
you but yeah I mean it's it's very

823.6 --> 831.0
fascinating apparently yeah it is a this

828.72 --> 834.0790000000001
entire process for me is a continuation

831.0 --> 836.48
of something that for me started in 2008

834.079 --> 841.199
when on some radio show I don't even

836.48 --> 845.759
remember where was a video some

841.199 --> 847.68
guy explaining how through electricity

845.759 --> 850.12
transmutation could

847.68 --> 854.56
happen and it was kind of

850.12 --> 857.0
secret and that was in 2008 I mean what

854.56 --> 861.6389999999999
these guys are talking about like to me

857.0 --> 866.639
is no doubt ex that's exactly the same

861.639 --> 869.639
thing as that man from the video that I

866.639 --> 872.88
watched in 2008 talking about that

869.639 --> 876.279
process much more roughly less

872.88 --> 878.959
Technical and less confusing like less

876.279 --> 881.04
elaborate not using space and time and

878.959 --> 882.959
all that [ __ ] or maybe he did at the

881.04 --> 885.8
time maybe that is all the thing that

882.959 --> 885.8
they just call it

893.04 --> 897.399
[Music]

894.32 --> 900.839
that right so a lot of things that do

897.399 --> 903.12
get involved within this process is like

900.839 --> 906.36
what they call sacred geometry very

903.12 --> 906.36
specific patterns start to

907.12 --> 913.519
happen division of force

910.92 --> 917.079
effects through the

913.519 --> 919.639
electricity that have like yeah

917.079 --> 923.079
transmutative

919.639 --> 925.72
qualities it is pretty amazing so what

923.079 --> 928.56
from what I now roughly understand thus

925.72 --> 932.36
far they basically create a setup where

928.56 --> 932.3599999999999
there's two opposite

933.92 --> 939.319
poles that

936.16 --> 941.36
like get such substantial forces

939.319 --> 946.399
subjected between

941.36 --> 948.48
them that like the idea of a black

946.399 --> 951.04
hole at one

948.48 --> 954.88
point one side one

951.04 --> 957.5999999999999
pole basically pulls in stuff at such a

954.88 --> 960.12
with such a power that it well

957.6 --> 963.519
rearranges the atom

960.12 --> 965.399
and even potentially forces them into a

963.519 --> 970.12
plasma

965.399 --> 974.16
state that then when they exit they

970.12 --> 976.68
reform based on very specific

974.16 --> 979.56
frequencies and that's how you do it and

976.68 --> 982.199
the timing of it leads to different

979.56 --> 982.199
material

983.24 --> 989.0
Transformations and

985.72 --> 991.0
yeah really interesting has absolutely

989.0 --> 993.6
nothing to do with

991.0 --> 996.72
SpaceTime right I mean I literally just

993.6 --> 1000.839
describe the process without using any

996.72 --> 1000.839
confusing science fiction like

1001.72 --> 1006.88
words it's just transmutation it's

1004.399 --> 1010.519
something new it's not the same old

1006.88 --> 1010.519
thing that everybody's always

1010.68 --> 1015.68
chasing yeah an

1013.24 --> 1017.16
aberration people keep fascinated with

1015.68 --> 1020.12
and and try to

1017.16 --> 1021.8
find proof of the aberration in new

1020.12 --> 1024.079
things they discover that's what people

1021.8 --> 1027.24
tend to

1024.079 --> 1029.839
do resulting in yeah entire cultures

1027.24 --> 1032.439
that are fascinated with gravity space

1029.839 --> 1035.24
time and see that in everything try to

1032.439 --> 1038.199
explain that in everything try

1035.24 --> 1040.4
to manifest the aberration as a real

1038.199 --> 1042.559
thing and there's people that do that

1040.4 --> 1044.1200000000001
with ether and that also gets involved

1042.559 --> 1048.199
in

1044.12 --> 1050.1999999999998
this right it's just a reification of

1048.199 --> 1053.2
things

1050.2 --> 1056.28
that are either not there at all you're

1053.2 --> 1059.8400000000001
just naming it like that just like

1056.28 --> 1061.6399999999999
naming how light is altered by claiming

1059.84 --> 1064.559
it has a speed and that the speed is

1061.64 --> 1067.2
altered and that that causes it well

1064.559 --> 1070.2
they do it here with SpaceTime too and

1067.2 --> 1070.2
yeah the ether is

1070.44 --> 1075.1200000000001
not ether in this case is just patterns

1073.72 --> 1078.32
it's not even something that does

1075.12 --> 1080.6399999999999
anything it's just the patterns simatic

1078.32 --> 1083.8799999999999
patterns

1080.64 --> 1088.3200000000002
symbol effects that basically come out

1083.88 --> 1091.64
of some of these ball lightning

1088.32 --> 1096.0
effects and these patterns are like

1091.64 --> 1099.64
encoded in esoteric symbols that go way

1096.0 --> 1101.679
back from medieval times arguably they

1099.64 --> 1105.3600000000001
show us those symbols and they're

1101.679 --> 1106.48
grafted into paintings and you find that

1105.36 --> 1110.76
find that

1106.48 --> 1110.76
within these types of EXP

1112.64 --> 1119.76
experiments yeah that's I just gave you

1115.6 --> 1119.76
the summary of it that's what it

1120.559 --> 1125.8799999999999
is but would with some practical

1123.52 --> 1128.0
applications of such discoveries well

1125.88 --> 1131.679
the Practical applications would be that

1128.0 --> 1134.2
you can suddenly create extremely hard

1131.679 --> 1139.2
to find rare

1134.2 --> 1139.2
materials out of basic resources

1140.679 --> 1148.96
that's the implications so it it

1144.96 --> 1152.159
literally negates any serious shortage

1148.96 --> 1155.799
that you might have and that can have

1152.159 --> 1160.4
like massive implications of course

1155.799 --> 1163.4
because uh well logically completely

1160.4 --> 1165.96
logically this transmutation process can

1163.4 --> 1170.8500000000001
actually create

1165.96 --> 1173.8400000000001
gold among a lot of other different

1170.85 --> 1177.6789999999999
[Music]

1173.84 --> 1180.32
things and yeah that has of course

1177.679 --> 1182.799
economic implications that are not going

1180.32 --> 1185.84
to be taken kindly

1182.799 --> 1188.559
off right because what it does is

1185.84 --> 1191.1589999999999
basically suddenly make nothing a

1188.559 --> 1192.96
uniquely rare resource because you can

1191.159 --> 1197.3600000000001
just create it

1192.96 --> 1200.8400000000001
now out of less rare

1197.36 --> 1204.0
materials no shortages well the thing is

1200.84 --> 1205.559
it still costs a lot of power to do it

1204.0 --> 1208.76
but if you have certain materials that

1205.559 --> 1211.72
are just particularly difficult to

1208.76 --> 1214.48
attain let's say for example tungsten

1211.72 --> 1216.64
right the hardest material known yeah

1214.48 --> 1219.32
that's a rare

1216.64 --> 1221.2800000000002
material but what if you could literally

1219.32 --> 1224.76
make tungsten out

1221.28 --> 1228.1589999999999
of I'm just just randomly saying

1224.76 --> 1231.2
something lead like material that's like

1228.159 --> 1231.2
not that rare at

1232.039 --> 1236.96
all or out of

1234.6 --> 1238.52
iron now it wouldn't be the only thing

1236.96 --> 1240.4
that you'd make out of it because the

1238.52 --> 1241.559
thing about this transmutation process

1240.4 --> 1244.88
is that it

1241.559 --> 1247.12
is the transmutation expresses itself in

1244.88 --> 1247.1200000000001
a

1249.159 --> 1254.1200000000001
spectrum so that means that upon the

1252.2 --> 1257.559
dischar the

1254.12 --> 1260.6
transmutation like waves out and creates

1257.559 --> 1260.6
different types of

1261.28 --> 1267.799
material and you have to time it right

1264.6 --> 1270.9189999999999
and then based on the timing a spectrum

1267.799 --> 1273.6
surrounding a certain material will

1270.919 --> 1276.72
manifest so it will manifest if you

1273.6 --> 1279.6789999999999
aimed it right the material

1276.72 --> 1282.4
intended and some other

1279.679 --> 1284.88
elements that will accompany it that are

1282.4 --> 1287.5590000000002
like around the same

1284.88 --> 1290.0800000000002
Spectrum so you can't just like have a

1287.559 --> 1293.279
machine and say like oh I put in a chunk

1290.08 --> 1295.84
of iron and then turn it on and then you

1293.279 --> 1300.08
just get this one material out of

1295.84 --> 1300.08
it it's always going to have side

1304.24 --> 1307.24
materials

1307.84 --> 1313.8799999999999
right Alchemy yeah it is alchemy that's

1311.44 --> 1317.2
what the Alchemist were

1313.88 --> 1319.3200000000002
doing and lightning is the key lightning

1317.2 --> 1322.6000000000001
is the key to Al

1319.32 --> 1322.6
me to

1327.4 --> 1332.88
transmutation yeah and they also believe

1329.64 --> 1335.1200000000001
it is to life and all that so I mean the

1332.88 --> 1337.1200000000001
people that in this video they do

1335.12 --> 1340.12
stretch their

1337.12 --> 1344.0
beliefs basically claiming that oh this

1340.12 --> 1346.3999999999999
is life like it is life

1344.0 --> 1349.2
itself I'd like to see them actually

1346.4 --> 1351.48
create life

1349.2 --> 1354.64
with this process actual life and not

1351.48 --> 1357.96
just Elemental life is what they

1354.64 --> 1360.96
basically say ball lightning is just

1357.96 --> 1362.72
like a very weird thing to say but it

1360.96 --> 1364.44
seems like there is a complicated

1362.72 --> 1367.72
process that

1364.44 --> 1370.6000000000001
involves ball lightning

1367.72 --> 1374.96
effects

1370.6 --> 1377.0
stages that can be analyzed and and

1374.96 --> 1380.1200000000001
those people that have done that they

1377.0 --> 1381.6
think it's a lie

1380.12 --> 1384.7199999999998
like it's

1381.6 --> 1388.84
consciously doing

1384.72 --> 1388.84
things it's very very

1389.44 --> 1394.1200000000001
weird checked out some videos B liing

1392.12 --> 1396.6789999999999
yeah

1394.12 --> 1398.52
fibs yeah and bll lightning does occur

1396.679 --> 1402.4
in nature as well although it's a

1398.52 --> 1402.4
relatively rare event

1422.64 --> 1427.679
right it's the coolest thing you've seen

1424.88 --> 1430.3200000000002
in a while yeah ball lightning I I find

1427.679 --> 1432.3200000000002
those very unnerving personally I think

1430.32 --> 1435.2
they're kind of

1432.32 --> 1437.12
scary they're fascinating but like I

1435.2 --> 1440.279
wouldn't want to

1437.12 --> 1441.84
be like seeing one with my own eyes

1440.279 --> 1445.44
because you never really know what they

1441.84 --> 1445.4399999999998
do they're really

1445.84 --> 1450.72
unpredictable like you could be staring

1447.96 --> 1452.52
at it and then suddenly they like Rush

1450.72 --> 1455.559
right at you and crash through your

1452.52 --> 1460.12
window and [ __ ] maybe even get shock you

1455.559 --> 1464.0
the hell so ball Lightnings are in

1460.12 --> 1464.0
nature kind of unpredictable

1469.0 --> 1472.76
it's like living being

1474.12 --> 1480.8799999999999
yeah in a way it is

1477.559 --> 1483.559
and I mean logically even through of

1480.88 --> 1488.0390000000002
Steiner Spirit cosmology I'd say like

1483.559 --> 1491.72
it's an elemental Spirit the spirit of

1488.039 --> 1491.72
electricity Spirit of the

1491.88 --> 1495.88
air right

1502.96 --> 1505.8400000000001
but yeah I mean the understanding of

1504.76 --> 1509.2
this

1505.84 --> 1511.48
process does like raise a huge amount of

1509.2 --> 1515.24
questions especially like in ancient

1511.48 --> 1518.64
times like how did did they know this

1515.24 --> 1523.32
stuff did they use it how did they use

1518.64 --> 1525.24
it how would the application of it have

1523.32 --> 1528.36
changed how things would

1525.24 --> 1531.279
work so these people a lot of them seem

1528.36 --> 1534.1589999999999
to claim that the ancient Egyptians had

1531.279 --> 1536.2
transmutation powers and they even might

1534.159 --> 1540.159
have used the pyramids for it which is

1536.2 --> 1541.76
really not that much of a stretch in my

1540.159 --> 1543.96
opinion I

1541.76 --> 1547.6
mean as far as I'm concerned it's

1543.96 --> 1550.48
already proven through circumstances and

1547.6 --> 1553.24
just what's been figured out about the

1550.48 --> 1556.039
architecture of it that pyramids were

1553.24 --> 1558.559
hydroelectric energy generators that I

1556.039 --> 1561.399
think were there to generate fields that

1558.559 --> 1563.24
positively influence life and all that

1561.399 --> 1566.9189999999999
but they could have also

1563.24 --> 1568.96
been internally at some

1566.919 --> 1571.3600000000001
place matter

1568.96 --> 1574.279
transmuters could very well be and they

1571.36 --> 1577.08
might even have been making like tons of

1574.279 --> 1581.0
gold with it for example instead of

1577.08 --> 1584.4399999999998
mining it they just make

1581.0 --> 1587.72
it and then chemically extract it is how

1584.44 --> 1591.799
you do it because again there's like a

1587.72 --> 1591.799
tons of different materials that get

1592.6 --> 1599.0
formed neph no not neph that's something

1596.799 --> 1602.76
completely different Elemental Spirits

1599.0 --> 1602.76
that's like a a lower form of

1603.36 --> 1607.039
conscious Elemental

1609.72 --> 1614.1200000000001
Consciousness

1611.36 --> 1616.1999999999998
right but I mean if if a society like

1614.12 --> 1620.039
ancient Egypt

1616.2 --> 1622.76
had transmutate

1620.039 --> 1625.24
transmuters then they could have like

1622.76 --> 1627.84
made all the

1625.24 --> 1629.6
resources especially metal and the like

1627.84 --> 1633.76
they wouldn't have to dig they wouldn't

1629.6 --> 1637.76
have to do much to just like create

1633.76 --> 1637.76
stock piles of certain

1639.039 --> 1642.799
materials including including

1641.039 --> 1647.12
potentially gold but maybe even other

1642.799 --> 1648.8799999999999
stuff and just use it and then there

1647.12 --> 1651.6
would have been

1648.88 --> 1656.159
piles of stuff that they wouldn't

1651.6 --> 1659.08
need like excess materials that keep

1656.159 --> 1661.519
getting produced when they specifically

1659.08 --> 1663.76
do that process to attain a specific

1661.519 --> 1665.6
material within that Spectrum it would

1663.76 --> 1667.0
have side material and that would just

1665.6 --> 1670.76
be like

1667.0 --> 1674.08
excess that there should be traces of

1670.76 --> 1676.12
that in that sense even like knowing

1674.08 --> 1680.72
this you

1676.12 --> 1684.1999999999998
could do historical excavation based

1680.72 --> 1688.32
research to find where transmutation

1684.2 --> 1691.72
processes generators have been used by

1688.32 --> 1694.4399999999998
finding certain

1691.72 --> 1698.48
materials it's like wow this specific

1694.44 --> 1701.1200000000001
spot is unusually rich in lead or who

1698.48 --> 1702.88
knows what else some kind of specific

1701.12 --> 1705.2399999999998
material that's relatively rare and you

1702.88 --> 1709.64
can't trace where it's coming from it's

1705.24 --> 1709.64
just it's just piled there

1709.84 --> 1715.1589999999999
well that's a sign that could

1713.08 --> 1717.48
potentially lead to the conclusion

1715.159 --> 1720.0800000000002
there's been transmutation processes

1717.48 --> 1723.6
happening there

1720.08 --> 1723.6
so it's very

1724.159 --> 1728.44
interesting right you wouldn't know by

1726.12 --> 1730.6
chat participation outside of fire roads

1728.44 --> 1734.3990000000001
though because

1730.6 --> 1734.399
apparently nobody really

1735.159 --> 1740.679
cares oh hello di for Dan na vet yeah

1738.36 --> 1744.1589999999999
Star Trek

1740.679 --> 1748.3990000000001
replicator it is a very

1744.159 --> 1751.3990000000001
early system for that replicators

1748.399 --> 1754.6399999999999
are ere exaggerated though I

1751.399 --> 1758.7199999999998
mean I don't think you're going to use a

1754.64 --> 1763.72
ball lightning transmutator to create

1758.72 --> 1763.72
organic complicated life that you could

1765.76 --> 1771.559
eat it's all very Elemental

1768.799 --> 1775.679
so you just you

1771.559 --> 1775.6789999999999
rotate the

1776.279 --> 1783.039
chemicals you do a transmutation

1779.64 --> 1785.519
rotation and yeah that that leads to

1783.039 --> 1787.12
deposits of Elementals

1785.519 --> 1791.0
not

1787.12 --> 1793.6789999999999
con from scratch constructed complicated

1791.0 --> 1796.88
organic structures like that's not part

1793.679 --> 1796.88
of transmutation

1803.08 --> 1806.08
m

1830.12 --> 1834.76
right but yeah

1839.039 --> 1843.96
just the amazing thing about

1841.399 --> 1846.32
transmutation is that if you just have a

1843.96 --> 1850.0
knowledge of all the different type of

1846.32 --> 1852.9189999999999
materials for which there is now a chart

1850.0 --> 1855.159
somebody made that and it's tested and

1852.919 --> 1857.679
found to be highly

1855.159 --> 1859.44
accurate well that means that you can

1857.679 --> 1863.48
then

1859.44 --> 1866.3990000000001
suddenly technically produce very

1863.48 --> 1869.3600000000001
specific types of materials that you

1866.399 --> 1872.36
might need in very specific

1869.36 --> 1872.36
processes

1873.0 --> 1876.44
including creating

1878.919 --> 1885.6000000000001
geopolymers so yeah geopolymer requires

1882.6 --> 1888.4399999999998
very specific ratio of pure

1885.6 --> 1890.559
materials that you use and then it like

1888.44 --> 1895.44
chemically transforms

1890.559 --> 1898.9189999999999
but how do you get so much of that very

1895.44 --> 1900.679
specific chemically pure resource where

1898.919 --> 1902.48
the hell did they get that do they M it

1900.679 --> 1905.0800000000002
how did they refine it to the Purity

1902.48 --> 1908.3600000000001
level that it becomes that

1905.08 --> 1910.48
reliable well if they had transmutation

1908.36 --> 1914.639
machines then that would have been the

1910.48 --> 1918.1200000000001
way to get relatively large amount of

1914.639 --> 1918.12
very pure

1918.88 --> 1923.96
substance that is very hard to attain

1921.559 --> 1927.48
normally that would have been used in

1923.96 --> 1931.24
vast quantities to create this

1927.48 --> 1935.24
geopolymer monolithic structures

1931.24 --> 1935.24
everywhere t

1942.46 --> 1945.539
[Music]

1948.7 --> 1951.8690000000001
[Music]

1965.08 --> 1969.1999999999998
so there you go how did the Ancients

1967.84 --> 1973.399
make all these

1969.2 --> 1973.3990000000001
geopolymer monolithic structures

1973.96 --> 1979.48
everywhere well to suggest that they

1976.639 --> 1982.36
quate it somewhere where and then

1979.48 --> 1984.24
transported like insane amounts that we

1982.36 --> 1987.84
don't even know how to transport in this

1984.24 --> 1990.96
current time frame they just just no

1987.84 --> 1992.279
just transported gigantic chunks of rock

1990.96 --> 1996.1200000000001
that are like

1992.279 --> 1999.2
insane insanely vast and

1996.12 --> 2001.0
heavy or you could imagine how who maybe

1999.2 --> 2002.919
they lighten it up somehow

2001.0 --> 2006.399
electrostatically or they lifted it

2002.919 --> 2008.519
simatic or something sure they might

2006.399 --> 2012.08
have been able to do that

2008.519 --> 2016.36
or they just create the materials from

2012.08 --> 2019.1589999999999
scratch and assemble it and put it into

2016.36 --> 2019.1589999999999
place on the

2021.88 --> 2028.6000000000001
spot like casting concrete except

2025.6 --> 2030.799
instead of concrete which very brittle

2028.6 --> 2034.639
and over time

2030.799 --> 2038.0
dtif breaks down instead of that they

2034.639 --> 2041.24
used way more efficient durable material

2038.0 --> 2041.24
matal like

2043.159 --> 2047.919
geopolymers you just have to have the

2045.32 --> 2052.52
right components that well you could

2047.919 --> 2052.52
figure out how to make that using

2052.599 --> 2058.079
transmutation so just take materials

2055.159 --> 2060.32
that are abundantly there like iron

2058.079 --> 2062.48
apparently iron is a real key component

2060.32 --> 2064.2000000000003
in transmutation process well iron is

2062.48 --> 2065.28
like one of the most abundant materials

2064.2 --> 2069.56
in on the

2065.28 --> 2069.5600000000004
earth in the metal

2071.399 --> 2077.919
category

2072.919 --> 2080.7599999999998
so yeah just get enough stockpile of

2077.919 --> 2082.5989999999997
material to transform and you can then

2080.76 --> 2085.28
produce vast

2082.599 --> 2088.599
quantities of very specific materials

2085.28 --> 2090.679
that you would use for other chemical

2088.599 --> 2094.679
processes like

2090.679 --> 2094.679
geopolymer casting

2106.4 --> 2111.76
okay me think what is mass conversations

2112.72 --> 2119.7999999999997
okay I don't know why that reminds you

2116.24 --> 2119.7999999999997
of that but

2131.839 --> 2136.2799999999997
all right

2133.76 --> 2139.599
so learning now

2136.28 --> 2142.079
that there's people out in the open

2139.599 --> 2144.2400000000002
figuring out transmutation and like

2142.079 --> 2147.8390000000004
basically making it in their

2144.24 --> 2150.2
garage one has to conclude that this

2147.839 --> 2153.72
process has been widely

2150.2 --> 2158.04
mapped and kept secret for quite some

2153.72 --> 2160.0
time arguably a 100 years or more

2158.04 --> 2162.56
and that it is being used and that

2160.0 --> 2164.88
certain materials are just being created

2162.56 --> 2164.88
out of

2173.92 --> 2180.56
nothing basically out of nothing like

2176.96 --> 2180.56
relatively rare resources

2181.8 --> 2188.079
so makes you look at the world very

2185.079 --> 2188.079
differently

2193.079 --> 2199.4
right maybe there were certain types of

2195.92 --> 2201.119
rare resources that suddenly showed up

2199.4 --> 2202.76
and like oh yeah we Min it at some

2201.119 --> 2206.04
really remote location we're keeping it

2202.76 --> 2209.0400000000004
a secret like did they really M that or

2206.04 --> 2209.04
did they create it with

2209.72 --> 2213.319
transmutation Granite couldn't be c yeah

2212.2 --> 2217.0789999999997
it

2213.319 --> 2220.2
can Paul Cook literally did videos about

2217.079 --> 2225.6800000000003
how that works you can cast

2220.2 --> 2225.68
geopolymer that will result into granite

2247.64 --> 2251.9
hello Stone

2248.74 --> 2251.8999999999996
[Music]

2272.56 --> 2276.56
monkey right

2277.839 --> 2283.04
so yeah let with this new information

2280.48 --> 2287.44
having found its way rather quickly in

2283.04 --> 2290.52
my mind like it settled in like I get it

2287.44 --> 2292.359
now I think I finally got a better

2290.52 --> 2295.52
framework of understanding of how these

2292.359 --> 2298.04
things work instead of a vague remote

2295.52 --> 2300.839
understanding as I've had for a

2298.04 --> 2302.4
while because I mean I knew since 2008

2300.839 --> 2305.52
like yeah there's some Transportation

2302.4 --> 2307.92
possible like it involves High heavy

2305.52 --> 2311.48
electricity that that was the EXT of my

2307.92 --> 2313.319
knowledge and I mean I've held that for

2311.48 --> 2316.0
almost two

2313.319 --> 2319.8
decades and

2316.0 --> 2319.8
now that knowledge is

2322.119 --> 2328.599
refined and the implications are

2326.52 --> 2332.119
vast understanding it certainly does

2328.599 --> 2337.6800000000003
help put into context better of like how

2332.119 --> 2337.6800000000003
it would have been used in the past

2349.319 --> 2355.16
okay well Moxy what's what are you doing

2371.04 --> 2376.72
MOX isn't impressed with I couldn't give

2373.56 --> 2376.72
a [ __ ]

2420.52 --> 2423.52
you

2438.839 --> 2441.04
okay

2441.88 --> 2447.52
[Music]

2444.0 --> 2449.96
Moxy I don't know why St monkey in here

2447.52 --> 2449.96
saying

2455.96 --> 2459.2400000000002
that right

2460.04 --> 2466.56
but uh yeah I mean I'm

2463.0 --> 2470.599
still quite filled up with all this

2466.56 --> 2470.599
stuff in my mind

2473.839 --> 2480.119
but I love to talk about

2476.8 --> 2481.8390000000004
it but yeah it's I guess it's all kind

2480.119 --> 2485.28
of early for

2481.839 --> 2485.2799999999997
you on this

2485.8 --> 2491.2000000000003
Sunday so uh filled the first 40 minutes

2490.24 --> 2495.72
with

2491.2 --> 2495.72
it and now we'll see what

2500.72 --> 2506.24
happens make sure the rogin up the show

2503.68 --> 2506.24
and share

2514.04 --> 2518.599
it and I'm thinking also like I would

2516.72 --> 2520.9199999999996
love to talk talk to like David Weiss

2518.599 --> 2520.92
about

2521.24 --> 2529.24
this kind of hope that he'll like

2525.599 --> 2531.6800000000003
watch this video the first 40 minutes

2529.24 --> 2536.7599999999998
when I'm explaining this I think that

2531.68 --> 2536.7599999999998
would be he would be very interested

2552.64 --> 2560.0
right but I mean when you watch these

2556.44 --> 2562.319
videos you do get confronted with ether

2560.0 --> 2566.359
stuff and like

2562.319 --> 2569.599
weird Ean beliefs and even space time

2566.359 --> 2572.0
and all that gets involved in it and oh

2569.599 --> 2575.319
space is time time is space I mean if

2572.0 --> 2577.319
you hear yourself saying that you got a

2575.319 --> 2580.359
problem

2577.319 --> 2584.88
like you got a problem

2580.359 --> 2589.2
then like that's like religious nonsense

2584.88 --> 2589.2000000000003
Babble and you should know

2593.04 --> 2597.839
that and apparently they're not

2595.16 --> 2600.1189999999997
abundantly aware of it they really think

2597.839 --> 2602.92
that they've figured out some kind of

2600.119 --> 2604.6800000000003
like core unifying principle but I mean

2602.92 --> 2607.76
anybody that's going to

2604.68 --> 2610.5589999999997
go and seek out

2607.76 --> 2613.2400000000002
unification of all things

2610.559 --> 2615.599
theoretically you have a problem because

2613.24 --> 2617.319
that's not how it works like that's a

2615.599 --> 2621.079
tendency of a

2617.319 --> 2621.079
mathematician not of a

2628.4 --> 2633.28
physicist right and these people they

2631.2 --> 2636.68
call themselves Alchemists and not

2633.28 --> 2638.52
physicists so I guess that is an excuse

2636.68 --> 2640.44
to this certain

2638.52 --> 2644.4
degree but I

2640.44 --> 2647.16
mean it's not necessary

2644.4 --> 2648.88
though it just seems like it's creating

2647.16 --> 2653.44
another

2648.88 --> 2653.44
division unnecessary polarized

2653.599 --> 2659.119
division within people's psyche that

2656.68 --> 2660.72
when they tackle This and like I'm not

2659.119 --> 2663.559
going to play along with that I'm going

2660.72 --> 2665.7599999999998
to find that way through because that's

2663.559 --> 2668.6800000000003
what I

2665.76 --> 2672.6800000000003
do yeah

2668.68 --> 2675.24
now transmutation is real it's getting

2672.68 --> 2678.68
figured out it's form of

2675.24 --> 2681.64
engineering and it does reveal

2678.68 --> 2681.64
mindboggling

2683.48 --> 2686.48
implications

2686.64 --> 2694.68
and arguably has entropy

2691.68 --> 2694.68
altering

2695.8 --> 2699.6400000000003
applications hey would work go

2704.24 --> 2707.24
anywhere

2707.68 --> 2712.3999999999996
what whenever you glue two conceptual

2710.4 --> 2717.119
mediums together they magically become

2712.4 --> 2717.119
physical mediums and control un

2718.8 --> 2723.04
uh that's hilarious

2727.72 --> 2732.359
how you do in the Woodwork gy bear

2729.52 --> 2732.359
haven't seen you in a

2735.38 --> 2741.96
[Music]

2738.96 --> 2744.44
while right yeah but why they draw in

2741.96 --> 2747.559
this space and this time stuff within

2744.44 --> 2749.8
the transmutation process it it's

2747.559 --> 2752.52
because they're like in visualizing like

2749.8 --> 2753.88
it's a a black hole is being formed

2752.52 --> 2756.599
something like

2753.88 --> 2760.359
that a white hole and a black hole a

2756.599 --> 2763.319
Ying Yang they call it and they just

2760.359 --> 2765.16
think of it like the forces that it's

2763.319 --> 2767.319
being subjected to us being pulled

2765.16 --> 2769.8799999999997
towards the center is so massive it's

2767.319 --> 2771.64
like a black hole well black hole is

2769.88 --> 2773.8
because of SpaceTime bending so maybe

2771.64 --> 2776.8799999999997
it's like a mini black hole SpaceTime

2773.8 --> 2779.96
bending event that's literally how that

2776.88 --> 2781.319
argumentation goes like that's why they

2779.96 --> 2783.2
name it like

2781.319 --> 2785.72
that

2783.2 --> 2787.8799999999997
because because of like how they think

2785.72 --> 2790.7999999999997
of the process compar compared to how

2787.88 --> 2793.1600000000003
how they've been taught blocked what do

2790.8 --> 2793.1600000000003
you mean

2795.2 --> 2799.9199999999996
[Music]

2797.839 --> 2803.2
blocked what's going on Woodwork and

2799.92 --> 2803.2000000000003
guny Bear

2834.359 --> 2838.52
could you please not be so incredibly

2836.48 --> 2842.0
vague in my chat Woodwork and gy bear

2838.52 --> 2842.0
that would be great

2859.64 --> 2865.52
right but yeah I mean you can translate

2863.319 --> 2867.24
these effects that happen during eye

2865.52 --> 2869.839
electricity

2867.24 --> 2873.359
transmutation the plasmoids which is

2869.839 --> 2873.359
kind of unique that

2873.8 --> 2879.6400000000003
they it's kind of hard for me to even

2876.4 --> 2883.079
like try to relay that

2879.64 --> 2886.839
that I'd have to watch it again they

2883.079 --> 2890.2000000000003
basically use some kind of plasma effect

2886.839 --> 2893.359
that then becomes self-contained and

2890.2 --> 2896.68
doesn't like immediately

2893.359 --> 2900.839
transform and then you can compress that

2896.68 --> 2903.24
very unique type of plasmoid through

2900.839 --> 2905.0789999999997
this transmutation process of like the

2903.24 --> 2907.52
yin and the Yang

2905.079 --> 2909.599
the extreme force that are then

2907.52 --> 2911.44
naturally created by that electricity

2909.599 --> 2913.3590000000004
lightning bolt

2911.44 --> 2918.839
machine and

2913.359 --> 2923.2799999999997
that then arguably electrically

2918.839 --> 2926.4
compresses the material to on a atomic

2923.28 --> 2928.8390000000004
scale that

2926.4 --> 2931.04
yeah there's no other way to even do

2928.839 --> 2935.4
that and that

2931.04 --> 2937.64
transmutes that just rearranges like the

2935.4 --> 2940.04
subatomic

2937.64 --> 2941.0789999999997
layout like the compression becomes so

2940.04 --> 2943.359
strong

2941.079 --> 2945.96
basically that it rearranges the

2943.359 --> 2948.44
subatomic layout of the

2945.96 --> 2950.92
materials that's very

2948.44 --> 2953.92
powerful but I mean it has nothing to do

2950.92 --> 2957.559
with gravitation whatsoever there is no

2953.92 --> 2957.559
gravitation it's just a

2961.599 --> 2970.799
concept some mode is on the do comments

2967.119 --> 2975.96
I don't know working on bear I mean

2970.799 --> 2975.96
there's a uh slow mode yeah that's

2976.88 --> 2981.4
right there is a slow mode that's

2987.76 --> 2991.44
correct low Lucy

2995.64 --> 2999.68
level for

3035.599 --> 3041.2000000000003
okay whatever turn it off again I'll

3039.0 --> 3044.48
just I'm sick of people

3041.2 --> 3044.48
complaining stop

3048.04 --> 3054.04
it don't know how it works none of my

3051.0 --> 3055.48
comments have posted for a week or two I

3054.04 --> 3057.7599999999998
don't know why it would work in gunny

3055.48 --> 3059.72
bear

3057.76 --> 3061.559
maybe it's because of certain words that

3059.72 --> 3065.5589999999997
you've been using I'm not sure but I

3061.559 --> 3067.6400000000003
mean YouTube like is very weird there's

3065.559 --> 3069.28
certain accounts that are just blocked

3067.64 --> 3071.48
even though they're not in my blog place

3069.28 --> 3071.48
or

3080.24 --> 3086.8799999999997
anything he was cleaning the chat up for

3083.52 --> 3089.4
a bit well just still do that then Moxy

3086.88 --> 3092.1600000000003
I mean if people start spamming with

3089.4 --> 3095.2400000000002
like one word sentences again then I'll

3092.16 --> 3095.24
turn slow mode back

3102.4 --> 3109.599
on I mean you shouldn't be complaining

3105.52 --> 3109.599
about it it's just a one

3111.48 --> 3118.52
minute F Dave was a good interview yeah

3114.52 --> 3118.52
I know W work G bear was very

3128.4 --> 3133.799
interesting was very happy about how

3130.599 --> 3133.799
that went

3170.599 --> 3175.799
let's see I can find that rotate to re

3172.799 --> 3175.799
chart

3186.28 --> 3188.6800000000003
that's the

3192.799 --> 3196.119
one yeah

3204.359 --> 3209.88
that's so yeah

3206.96 --> 3212.68
this chart transmutation

3209.88 --> 3214.4
chart I mean it is really impressive

3212.68 --> 3219.64
I'll show you the

3214.4 --> 3219.64
chart because it's part of that video

3225.44 --> 3228.44
presentation

3232.96 --> 3237.44
see does that work

3241.48 --> 3243.799
[ __ ]

3247.16 --> 3250.5989999999997
sake there you

3252.2 --> 3259.2799999999997
go so this is that

3256.0 --> 3261.96
chart and in it is like the trans that

3259.28 --> 3263.48
this is the transmutation chart now they

3261.96 --> 3268.28
claim that this is

3263.48 --> 3270.88
all has to do with space time

3268.28 --> 3274.52
like within a within a

3270.88 --> 3277.2400000000002
cycle but I mean that literally couldn't

3274.52 --> 3280.559
have anything to do with

3277.24 --> 3282.799
it not that it like really matters all

3280.559 --> 3282.799
that

3283.319 --> 3288.88
much it's just fascinating that they

3285.72 --> 3291.2
figured out and catalog

3288.88 --> 3292.799
this even though it technically doesn't

3291.2 --> 3293.96
have anything to do with space and time

3292.799 --> 3297.4
that's

3293.96 --> 3301.0
just purely conceptual and

3297.4 --> 3305.28
Superfluous to the findings of

3301.0 --> 3305.28
it is a brilliant piece of

3311.119 --> 3315.28
engineering all right

3328.72 --> 3336.359
the science proves that

3331.28 --> 3338.2400000000002
the no that's Flat Earth is a geometric

3336.359 --> 3341.48
claim it's not a scientific

3338.24 --> 3343.52
claim but science does prove there's no

3341.48 --> 3346.119
outer space because it violates the

3343.52 --> 3346.119
second law

3347.0 --> 3350.839
thermodynamics natural law is

3350.96 --> 3358.599
violated so science would disprove

3354.92 --> 3361.799
heliocentrism it doesn't prove Flat

3358.599 --> 3365.2000000000003
Earth going to have to use geometry to

3361.799 --> 3365.2
prove that

3381.58 --> 3384.67
[Music]

3391.68 --> 3395.0789999999997
what why are you bringing that

3397.359 --> 3402.119
up I did not get a copy of the app why

3400.72 --> 3404.9199999999996
are you bringing up the app I'm not

3402.119 --> 3404.92
talking about

3409.44 --> 3414.839
that kind of rude statement is that Moxy

3412.68 --> 3418.1189999999997
don't do

3414.839 --> 3421.24
that okay rank

3418.119 --> 3426.48
don't okay I'm turning slow mode back

3421.24 --> 3426.4799999999996
on stop it you guys are pissing me

3436.319 --> 3441.5589999999997
off yeah Frank's not [ __ ] funny

3452.76 --> 3456.1600000000003
hello Cleary

3481.039 --> 3485.76
what

3483.44 --> 3488.7200000000003
loneliness yeah I mean

3485.76 --> 3490.28
fibs the Friend Finder basically Flat

3488.72 --> 3492.4399999999996
Earth Friend Finder that's an

3490.28 --> 3496.119
interesting aspect of Dave's

3492.44 --> 3498.52
happen I'd be interested in using that

3496.119 --> 3501.1600000000003
for that reason especially since there's

3498.52 --> 3503.4
apparently a lot of use in the

3501.16 --> 3506.3999999999996
Netherlands it could be all kinds of

3503.4 --> 3506.4
interesting

3512.119 --> 3518.92
I don't know why don't you ask Dave why

3514.96 --> 3519.839
Moxy but you go to him yeah I am not his

3518.92 --> 3523.0
app

3519.839 --> 3523.0
salesman got

3535.039 --> 3539.079
it for

3588.68 --> 3594.44
wow F what or

3611.28 --> 3615.6800000000003
sorry to recognize that

3617.18 --> 3620.3599999999997
[Music]

3645.96 --> 3651.92
myal

3647.16 --> 3651.92
weapons oh right

3662.2 --> 3664.64
yeah yeah

3665.119 --> 3670.799
yeah yeah those things supposed mystical

3668.28 --> 3670.799
weapons I

3674.92 --> 3681.0
mean yeah that's even part of the

3678.319 --> 3683.72
patterns that come out of

3681.0 --> 3687.359
transmutation so that is part of the

3683.72 --> 3689.319
thing the patterns that do form when you

3687.359 --> 3692.48
apply transmutation like that through

3689.319 --> 3692.48
the ball lightning

3701.88 --> 3709.48
machine so I mean they're not literal

3705.319 --> 3712.16
devices in that sense it's a

3709.48 --> 3714.359
pattern maybe they were literal devices

3712.16 --> 3717.359
I mean it's it's in the past and it's

3714.359 --> 3717.359
been

3720.44 --> 3724.64
who knows I mean nobody's shooting

3722.839 --> 3727.0
lightning bolts with those things or

3724.64 --> 3730.48
anything but it seems

3727.0 --> 3735.4
that that is part of like the patterns

3730.48 --> 3735.4
that form in the transmutation

3735.76 --> 3741.96
process it's like how

3739.64 --> 3744.4
the the

3741.96 --> 3746.76
electromagnetic lines are divided and

3744.4 --> 3750.76
all that like how the patterns are divid

3746.76 --> 3753.2000000000003
it during the process and then that

3750.76 --> 3759.5200000000004
pattern appears within

3753.2 --> 3759.52
it within the sacred geometry as it were

3790.68 --> 3795.9199999999996
yo Clary why the hell do you keep

3792.359 --> 3795.92
calling him rank

3827.48 --> 3833.039
I was chilling with it yeah why why do

3829.44 --> 3836.68
you keep like persistently leaving the F

3833.039 --> 3839.92
out that makes no sense it's annoying

3836.68 --> 3839.9199999999996
and distracting

3850.65 --> 3854.639
[Music]

3871.359 --> 3876.279
it's annoying clear stop it

3897.799 --> 3900.16
right

3902.72 --> 3907.48
anyhow 1 hour in I think that's

3905.67 --> 3910.88
[Music]

3907.48 --> 3913.76
uh it's been quite interesting and I'll

3910.88 --> 3917.559
be digging further to

3913.76 --> 3919.6400000000003
basically figure out whether my insights

3917.559 --> 3922.6800000000003
what I found the way

3919.64 --> 3924.4
through if that is indeed correct or not

3922.68 --> 3926.72
based on more

3924.4 --> 3929.44
feedback of all these videos and they

3926.72 --> 3929.4399999999996
have plenty of

3930.24 --> 3934.4399999999996
videos I don't know how long it's been

3932.559 --> 3937.0
going but I mean this channel seems like

3934.44 --> 3940.11
it's been out there for a

3937.0 --> 3940.11
[Music]

3945.839 --> 3953.5589999999997
while yeah Frank why don't you stop yeah

3950.079 --> 3953.559
nobody cares

3959.96 --> 3964.839
anyway I'm going to take a two minute

3961.96 --> 3964.839
break I'll be right

3984.559 --> 3987.559
back

4014.52 --> 4017.52
e

4044.52 --> 4047.52
e

4074.44 --> 4078.48
e e

4129.759 --> 4132.319
and I'm

4134.44 --> 4138.4
back for

4181.44 --> 4184.5199999999995
hey clutch good see

4194.32 --> 4197.32
you

4224.32 --> 4228.28
for for

4259.88 --> 4262.400000000001
oh that's

4262.64 --> 4271.2390000000005
weird Okay clear sent me a a

4267.199 --> 4274.28
picture apparently Frank

4271.239 --> 4276.799999999999
here he doesn't see the F in there that

4274.28 --> 4276.8
is really

4279.84 --> 4285.719
weird right but I mean clearly you can

4283.12 --> 4289.12
watch my screen

4285.719 --> 4292.92
right in the chat and then see that

4289.12 --> 4296.44
obviously it isn't that so whatever is

4292.92 --> 4298.56
going on with your chat that's just

4296.44 --> 4301.678999999999
something

4298.56 --> 4305.56
weird oh yeah YouTube chat y your chat

4301.679 --> 4305.56
is glitchy mine isn't

4321.48 --> 4327.36
I'll share it people I mean what you're

4323.84 --> 4330.88
talking about is true but it is weird

4327.36 --> 4334.799999999999
just apparently this

4330.88 --> 4337.28
is how clearly sees the chat well that's

4334.8 --> 4337.28
on your

4344.159 --> 4348.159
end for

4381.56 --> 4388.400000000001
BS what do you mean

4384.36 --> 4390.88
BS I just showed you the screenshot he

4388.4 --> 4393.5599999999995
he showed me I mean yeah he's being a

4390.88 --> 4393.56
troll about

4397.639 --> 4404.6
it but yeah hello extra pixels

4417.159 --> 4422.04
wolf that's not a wolf that's a raccoon

4420.159 --> 4425.04
picture VI

4422.04 --> 4425.04
roads

4427.679 --> 4433.1990000000005
what what the hell are you blabbering

4430.199 --> 4433.199
about

4443.4 --> 4448.96
hey guys how about the subject you don't

4447.199 --> 4451.12
want to talk about

4448.96 --> 4454.08
it don't want to talk about it you want

4451.12 --> 4458.5199999999995
to just blabber on about other things

4454.08 --> 4458.5199999999995
that are not interesting

4465.88 --> 4471.4400000000005
right but I mean maybe it's just too

4468.32 --> 4474.32
heavy for you in this Sunday

4471.44 --> 4477.12
morning whatever I mean I did my

4474.32 --> 4480.679
presentation I I did my explanations my

4477.12 --> 4483.8
insights and I mean I basically just

4480.679 --> 4489.4
watched this video and figure this

4483.8 --> 4489.400000000001
out like not even 12 hours ago

4492.679 --> 4498.6
so but I think that

4495.84 --> 4501.76
like cognitively I did make like a big

4498.6 --> 4503.4800000000005
leap forward in just understanding how

4501.76 --> 4507.280000000001
what this is and how it

4503.48 --> 4511.919999999999
works and the misconceptions that

4507.28 --> 4514.0
are found in between these people's

4511.92 --> 4517.52
explanations right and that doesn't take

4514.0 --> 4519.76
away from the

4517.52 --> 4522.040000000001
effectiveness of what they figured out

4519.76 --> 4522.04
what they

4522.239 --> 4528.799999999999
engineered it's just a little little

4526.719 --> 4530.8
convoluting apparently it makes them

4528.8 --> 4533.8
really enthusiastic I mean that first

4530.8 --> 4533.8
video that I

4533.84 --> 4540.4400000000005
watched the plasmoid video that I link

4536.719 --> 4543.639
that David Weiss Linked UP linked me up

4540.44 --> 4545.799999999999
with on the night ow show that I posted

4543.639 --> 4547.4400000000005
back then like there were guys in there

4545.8 --> 4551.08
that were like oh

4547.44 --> 4553.48
transmutation oh this is ideal for space

4551.08 --> 4555.5199999999995
exploration and all like they were

4553.48 --> 4557.959999999999
really like getting all the

4555.52 --> 4559.76
we can finally do space exploration with

4557.96 --> 4561.88
this like

4559.76 --> 4567.4400000000005
bro

4561.88 --> 4567.4400000000005
BR like that is that is

4567.6 --> 4575.08
just [ __ ] I mean yeah hey but

4572.32 --> 4577.08
smarter you are the more potential of

4575.08 --> 4581.12
actually being [ __ ] that you will

4577.08 --> 4583.5599999999995
display so I mean I'm not

4581.12 --> 4585.28
surprised right you know one field you

4583.56 --> 4587.360000000001
master that field that does doesn't

4585.28 --> 4590.04
exclude you from being completely

4587.36 --> 4592.08
ignorant and [ __ ] in other

4590.04 --> 4595.679
fields and

4592.08 --> 4598.32
uh yeah it all just solidifies the way

4595.679 --> 4600.719
it does right I mean it doesn't take

4598.32 --> 4604.88
away from the respect I have

4600.719 --> 4607.92
for for their ability to puzzle this out

4604.88 --> 4610.6
this practical

4607.92 --> 4614.04
thing that is very impressive I do

4610.6 --> 4617.120000000001
respect them for it but I mean I am a

4614.04 --> 4620.679
hobby Psych ol ologist by nature and I

4617.12 --> 4623.639
just pick up on this it's like oh big

4620.679 --> 4626.36
wizard right big delusions here and

4623.639 --> 4629.52
there it's not really even

4626.36 --> 4631.839999999999
relevant because it doesn't detract from

4629.52 --> 4634.719
the quality of

4631.84 --> 4637.679
their of their work basically but it's

4634.719 --> 4637.679
just like oh

4640.88 --> 4646.84
typical and really not that hard to work

4644.44 --> 4646.839999999999
around

4647.719 --> 4650.44
like you

4648.92 --> 4653.1990000000005
basically

4650.44 --> 4656.44
translate these

4653.199 --> 4660.199
explanations do a little transmutation

4656.44 --> 4662.159
on the use of words yeah just you just

4660.199 --> 4663.48
don't say don't call it that just call

4662.159 --> 4666.28
it something

4663.48 --> 4669.0
else something that's not tied in with

4666.28 --> 4672.759999999999
the nonsense disproven science fiction

4669.0 --> 4676.159
ideas that have been inserted by pseudo

4672.76 --> 4680.12
science heliocentric priest

4676.159 --> 4682.48
and suddenly it's like yeah it's very

4680.12 --> 4684.199
palpable it's very easy to fit in your

4682.48 --> 4687.199
mind very easy to understand what's

4684.199 --> 4690.799999999999
actually happening there and it's like

4687.199 --> 4694.919999999999
yeah oh it's a new completely new thing

4690.8 --> 4697.679
a completely new range of understanding

4694.92 --> 4700.4
and guess what oh there's a new thing oh

4697.679 --> 4703.4
oh a new field let's fill it in with

4700.4 --> 4707.28
science fiction words I'm surprised they

4703.4 --> 4711.36
didn't even throw in the word Quantum or

4707.28 --> 4714.96
something right oh New Field a new

4711.36 --> 4716.679
breakthrough field of of insight of

4714.96 --> 4719.0
engineering

4716.679 --> 4721.84
information that unique can't be

4719.0 --> 4724.32
compared to other things let's insert

4721.84 --> 4726.88
the science fiction word that are all

4724.32 --> 4729.799999999999
about the time so that everybody's all

4726.88 --> 4731.4800000000005
interested because oh somebody found

4729.8 --> 4734.4400000000005
proof of the thing that we've been

4731.48 --> 4737.839999999999
chasing forever yet seems to elude us

4734.44 --> 4742.839999999999
and get disproven over a century

4737.84 --> 4742.84
long cuz people just Chase

4742.92 --> 4748.76
aberration then when an engineer figures

4745.639 --> 4751.12
out a whole new field of understanding

4748.76 --> 4754.320000000001
based on practical applications then

4751.12 --> 4757.159
well they have a tendency to just fill

4754.32 --> 4761.28
it in with the aberration because that

4757.159 --> 4763.759999999999
gets a lot of attention it draws in

4761.28 --> 4765.239
attention it's all these dreamers that

4763.76 --> 4768.96
are chasing the G

4765.239 --> 4771.599999999999
the aberration the unprovable things

4768.96 --> 4775.2390000000005
that that they just stay fascinated

4771.6 --> 4777.76
with yeah they will all be drawn

4775.239 --> 4779.799999999999
in they might even like throw money at

4777.76 --> 4782.04
you because it's like oh my dreams are

4779.8 --> 4785.679
finally being proven or something oh

4782.04 --> 4788.32
take my money so yeah maybe maybe that's

4785.679 --> 4788.32
why they do

4790.0 --> 4795.56
that but uh yeah I'm not buying into

4792.8 --> 4799.84
that part

4795.56 --> 4799.84
I'm I'm not the target group I

4802.08 --> 4807.32
guess but the findings themselves are

4805.719 --> 4809.6
well they speak for themselves that's

4807.32 --> 4809.599999999999
pretty

4811.719 --> 4816.199
incredible space metal can be

4820.76 --> 4825.56
made you're going to watch it again to

4823.12 --> 4826.88
wrap your head around

4825.56 --> 4829.8
yeah or we could just have a

4826.88 --> 4829.8
conversation about

4853.639 --> 4859.88
it right you did want to come

4856.44 --> 4864.36
on with me for a night all show right

4859.88 --> 4864.36
perhaps well we could talk about

4868.28 --> 4874.12
this or we could continue Conversation

4871.0 --> 4875.719
Over Skype I mean it's all good maybe

4874.12 --> 4877.96
you don't feel confident enough to

4875.719 --> 4880.96
actually

4877.96 --> 4883.199
represent I get it and talk about it

4880.96 --> 4885.36
more I mean I can explain this stuff

4883.199 --> 4888.599999999999
over and over again I mean

4885.36 --> 4892.04
it would I would not recommend against

4888.6 --> 4894.84
recommend against just watching the thir

4892.04 --> 4896.04
the first what is it 30 40 minutes of

4894.84 --> 4900.28
today's

4896.04 --> 4902.56
show which I basically like explain it

4900.28 --> 4902.5599999999995
all

4902.88 --> 4908.76
summarized I wouldn't yeah if you want

4905.36 --> 4912.4
to get it better just watch my

4908.76 --> 4915.12
explanation a couple of

4912.4 --> 4916.759999999999
times and then if you have it direct

4915.12 --> 4919.92
question which I had hoped that you

4916.76 --> 4925.719
would have had while I was doing

4919.92 --> 4925.719
that then you can ask and I will answer

4952.58 --> 4955.97
[Music]

4957.48 --> 4964.919999999999
see yeah that in lightning plasmoid

4961.719 --> 4969.199
Transportation not ether or space

4964.92 --> 4969.1990000000005
time very proud of what I'm doing

4970.719 --> 4975.159
here this is the kind of thing that

4972.719 --> 4977.44
needs to be done not the

4975.159 --> 4978.5599999999995
watch the video and dismiss it all out

4977.44 --> 4982.879999999999
of

4978.56 --> 4987.92
hand because some

4982.88 --> 4991.36
obvious pseudo science talk was being

4987.92 --> 4994.32
utilized within the engineering

4991.36 --> 4997.0
explanation but just like yeah just

4994.32 --> 4999.84
point that out and then actually take

4997.0 --> 5002.199
the valuable Discovery and Engineering

4999.84 --> 5002.92
developments for what they are because

5002.199 --> 5006.28
they

5002.92 --> 5009.04
are very

5006.28 --> 5011.719
valuable they are actually so valuable

5009.04 --> 5013.239
that they could rearrange our very

5011.719 --> 5014.84
understanding of

5013.239 --> 5018.0
value

5014.84 --> 5021.0
itself material

5018.0 --> 5021.0
value

5028.159 --> 5033.08
literally think some of the Sacred Geet

5030.76 --> 5036.96
architecture was a natural consequence

5033.08 --> 5036.96
of past building

5044.12 --> 5050.32
processes

5046.28 --> 5054.12
perhaps but I mean sacred geometry in

5050.32 --> 5057.759999999999
architecture like obviously has a

5054.12 --> 5060.639
function so I don't think that it's like

5057.76 --> 5062.76
oh it just happen to come out like that

5060.639 --> 5065.76
I think it was intended to come out like

5062.76 --> 5065.76
that

5068.84 --> 5074.28
because of its influence the simatic

5071.679 --> 5076.88
architecture has an influence that very

5074.28 --> 5082.239
specific

5076.88 --> 5084.36
influences like sound stabilization and

5082.239 --> 5087.36
resonance and

5084.36 --> 5087.36
electric

5087.88 --> 5095.679
influences bio energy field

5091.76 --> 5097.76
influences and so yeah I mean did it

5095.679 --> 5100.52
just naturally come into being well I

5097.76 --> 5101.76
don't think they the grew they grew

5100.52 --> 5104.6
these

5101.76 --> 5106.4800000000005
structures like a plant and it just

5104.6 --> 5108.2390000000005
comes out like that naturally because

5106.48 --> 5110.959999999999
that's the sacred geomet I don't think

5108.239 --> 5110.959999999999
it works like

5114.679 --> 5118.32
that but I think

5118.6 --> 5126.1990000000005
that they would adapt the architecture

5122.44 --> 5129.48
to the sacred G

5126.199 --> 5132.879999999999
and that would simply just make it

5129.48 --> 5135.4
better more positively

5132.88 --> 5139.4800000000005
influencing more

5135.4 --> 5139.48
resonating right simatic

5142.199 --> 5149.159
adapted but I mean parts of it let's say

5146.639 --> 5151.96
that like these buildings are assembled

5149.159 --> 5154.96
and a lot of it is bound to have been

5151.96 --> 5157.119
assembled well then they would have like

5154.96 --> 5159.199
partially made certain things based on

5157.119 --> 5161.719
simatic

5159.199 --> 5164.159
processes like for example one of those

5161.719 --> 5165.719
special Windows round windows with like

5164.159 --> 5168.0
the elaborate patterns like how they

5165.719 --> 5172.36
would have made it probably subjected

5168.0 --> 5175.32
some simatics to that and

5172.36 --> 5178.599999999999
then cast it based on those simatic

5175.32 --> 5181.04
patterns and then you put it in there

5178.6 --> 5182.8
right so still assembled it wasn't just

5181.04 --> 5187.0
all done in

5182.8 --> 5190.8
one single simatic sound based go or

5187.0 --> 5190.8
something would have still been

5194.119 --> 5199.5199999999995
assembled but I mean yeah the sacred

5196.44 --> 5203.08
geometry they just did that because

5199.52 --> 5205.320000000001
that's what works they figured out what

5203.08 --> 5207.8
works

5205.32 --> 5210.759999999999
then right first you like have the

5207.8 --> 5212.6
patterns see what is associated with the

5210.76 --> 5214.360000000001
patterns like a certain sound and say oh

5212.6 --> 5216.679
what does that sound have an influence

5214.36 --> 5218.88
how does it have an influence on life or

5216.679 --> 5221.4400000000005
plant growth or something then they just

5218.88 --> 5223.159000000001
keep toying around with it until they

5221.44 --> 5226.159
found beneficial effects and then

5223.159 --> 5229.0
they're like oh this certain sound keeps

5226.159 --> 5232.199
making the plants grow

5229.0 --> 5235.199
huh what type of simatic pattern is

5232.199 --> 5237.599999999999
directly associated with that specific

5235.199 --> 5240.799999999999
growth sound oh look it's that specific

5237.6 --> 5243.159000000001
pattern huh I don't know which one it is

5240.8 --> 5245.56
could be all kinds of things but it will

5243.159 --> 5247.36
probably be a recog IO pattern like

5245.56 --> 5249.6
maybe it's the flower of life right for

5247.36 --> 5252.92
example something like that and like

5249.6 --> 5254.6
okay well let's reverse engineer that

5252.92 --> 5256.4800000000005
let's make

5254.6 --> 5260.0
a

5256.48 --> 5262.32
building that has that will have like

5260.0 --> 5265.4
that specific sound in It produced and

5262.32 --> 5267.599999999999
then you use a window to specifically

5265.4 --> 5270.08
project that sound outwards on a big

5267.6 --> 5274.0
field and that will make everything grow

5270.08 --> 5274.0
and then they built that

5276.4 --> 5282.119
like a sound based growing machine I

5279.08 --> 5284.239
mean in small ways this is being used

5282.119 --> 5286.159
even by Farmers they figured out like

5284.239 --> 5289.959999999999
hey if we play this certain classical

5286.159 --> 5294.4
music in our field Everything grows

5289.96 --> 5294.4
better it's basically the same

5299.159 --> 5306.119
principle every living being has a

5301.56 --> 5306.119000000001
simatic resonance yes

5312.08 --> 5316.679
every to a point where every cell has a

5315.52 --> 5319.639
specific

5316.679 --> 5324.159
resonance there's alternative medical

5319.639 --> 5327.400000000001
fields that have specifically adapted to

5324.159 --> 5330.32
that where you're in order to heal

5327.4 --> 5335.839999999999
certain conditions you're subjected to a

5330.32 --> 5335.84
frequency that counters that condition

5339.159 --> 5344.719
hey elg good to see you I'm G to get my

5341.719 --> 5344.719
coffee I'll be right

5363.04 --> 5367.08
back for

5421.92 --> 5427.32
to pay a visit to St Paul's Cathedral

5424.76 --> 5427.320000000001
I bet it

5430.44 --> 5434.96
will I bet it does I mean

5436.36 --> 5440.32
yeah but you got to realize also that

5439.119 --> 5444.119
these

5440.32 --> 5445.5599999999995
places have been repurposed away from

5444.119 --> 5448.199
the

5445.56 --> 5451.6
original technology that they were used

5448.199 --> 5451.599999999999
for so

5478.159 --> 5483.889999999999
m

5480.78 --> 5483.889999999999
[Music]

5510.56 --> 5515.679
right so uh I hope everybody's enjoying

5512.52 --> 5515.679
this show

5516.119 --> 5521.08
don't forget that rogans it up if you do

5518.719 --> 5525.119
and share it and please consider

5521.08 --> 5527.84
donating to my PayPal keeps me going and

5525.119 --> 5530.5599999999995
again thanks for all the patreon

5527.84 --> 5532.4800000000005
supporters means a little bit but I mean

5530.56 --> 5535.0
little bits help

5532.48 --> 5537.44
too I wish my patreon support would

5535.0 --> 5541.56
become bigger

5537.44 --> 5544.759999999999
though but yeah I mean not everybody

5541.56 --> 5547.88
gets like a 100 people that are become

5544.76 --> 5547.88
part of that I

5559.4 --> 5566.0
guess H okay F Ro yeah good luck with

5562.88 --> 5566.0
the painting

5599.04 --> 5603.199
interesting which one

5624.78 --> 5630.08
[Music]

5627.92 --> 5634.04
the

5630.08 --> 5637.04
topic right you mean the source video

5634.04 --> 5637.04
that I posted in

5641.44 --> 5648.04
Skype I mean anybody here that's not

5645.52 --> 5650.0
been linked up to it I'll repost it so

5648.04 --> 5652.04
you can check it out yourself I mean

5650.0 --> 5655.88
it's kind of a long

5652.04 --> 5659.76
video and again there's

5655.88 --> 5662.8
some oh oh we can finally do space

5659.76 --> 5664.4800000000005
travel like there is some silly [ __ ] in

5662.8 --> 5667.0
there for

5664.48 --> 5669.799999999999
bards that's part of it like oh it's so

5667.0 --> 5671.639
revolutionary but I mean it is

5669.8 --> 5676.4400000000005
revolutionary

5671.639 --> 5676.4400000000005
though just not for those

5679.52 --> 5683.96
purposes interesting straight yeah it's

5681.719 --> 5686.0
very technical and very direct I mean

5683.96 --> 5689.36
the guy that's presenting it is kind of

5686.0 --> 5690.44
a nerd but he's like really sticking to

5689.36 --> 5695.28
the

5690.44 --> 5695.28
subject he's doing a good job

5709.56 --> 5715.96
right I mean this is not like suspicion

5712.32 --> 5718.08
stories or like oh I went with a couple

5715.96 --> 5719.719
of strange guys and they showed me

5718.08 --> 5722.5599999999995
something and then oh

5719.719 --> 5725.36
wow metals that were transmuted out of

5722.56 --> 5727.320000000001
nothing oo what is is that W like this

5725.36 --> 5729.639
is not a vague story this is literally

5727.32 --> 5733.199
the engineers that have

5729.639 --> 5736.04
like mapped it out figured out exactly

5733.199 --> 5737.839999999999
what's happening how it's happening and

5736.04 --> 5742.44
then they made

5737.84 --> 5745.96
charts of how it works in a very refined

5742.44 --> 5749.5199999999995
detail and they just like name it oh

5745.96 --> 5752.28
this where within the space time cycle

5749.52 --> 5753.84
and time is space space is time oh it

5752.28 --> 5757.5599999999995
makes all sense no it doesn't that

5753.84 --> 5761.2390000000005
doesn't make any [ __ ] sense but it's

5757.56 --> 5764.639
okay you can subject that nonsense to it

5761.239 --> 5766.718999999999
it doesn't take away from the the actual

5764.639 --> 5768.159000000001
value of the engineering that has been

5766.719 --> 5772.08
worked

5768.159 --> 5774.5199999999995
out you can just take out the

5772.08 --> 5777.28
nonsense and replace it with something

5774.52 --> 5782.679
that's a little bit more

5777.28 --> 5782.679
sensible or just ignore that part

5784.159 --> 5790.159
because if it works it

5787.679 --> 5794.08
works you can claim that it is because

5790.159 --> 5796.599999999999
of some space time Distortion cycle that

5794.08 --> 5799.48
happens or you could just say like yeah

5796.6 --> 5801.56
when you subject materials to something

5799.48 --> 5803.718999999999
this intense with

5801.56 --> 5807.92
electricity the very

5803.719 --> 5810.199
nature of the the atoms just starts it

5807.92 --> 5815.52
basically breaks through more

5810.199 --> 5815.5199999999995
barriers of cohesion of matter

5816.04 --> 5823.199
it breaks down the material to an

5819.44 --> 5825.678999999999
subatomic level and then eventually it

5823.199 --> 5830.08
rearranges again and the way that

5825.679 --> 5833.4800000000005
rearrangement process happens is mapped

5830.08 --> 5833.48
and very specific you can

5833.56 --> 5839.52
literally time it you have to time it

5835.92 --> 5844.719
and then specific materials are will

5839.52 --> 5844.719
come out when the deconstructed

5845.84 --> 5851.84
particles reconstruct as they are

5849.0 --> 5854.76
ejected from that specific process I

5851.84 --> 5857.1990000000005
mean it's a rough explanation but that's

5854.76 --> 5859.320000000001
basically what it is and it is like

5857.199 --> 5862.598999999999
magnificent

5859.32 --> 5865.599
engineering transmutation refined and

5862.599 --> 5865.599
charted

5872.25 --> 5877.029
[Music]

5891.44 --> 5897.799999999999
and like the overall implications are

5894.28 --> 5900.639
quite astounding too I mean

5897.8 --> 5902.719
technically theoretically you could

5900.639 --> 5904.04
conceive you could like create nuclear

5902.719 --> 5908.0
materials with

5904.04 --> 5908.0
is in very pure

5908.08 --> 5915.719
form you can create anything with it

5911.36 --> 5917.759999999999
like every conceivable form of matter

5915.719 --> 5921.119
you could create with

5917.76 --> 5923.679
this except organic

5921.119 --> 5926.0
components you can only create the raw

5923.679 --> 5929.92
materials

5926.0 --> 5932.84
apparently raw atom Atomic materials

5929.92 --> 5937.0
maybe some weird Composites but you're

5932.84 --> 5937.0
not going to have complicated organic

5937.88 --> 5942.119
structures

5939.44 --> 5945.239
right it's only while the process is

5942.119 --> 5948.0
going there may be some apparent

5945.239 --> 5951.5199999999995
Elemental life form that

5948.0 --> 5955.0
happens which is really surreal but it's

5951.52 --> 5958.0
only while the electricity is

5955.0 --> 5960.52
effectively being

5958.0 --> 5963.52
there it's part of the transmutation

5960.52 --> 5963.52
process

5964.56 --> 5969.2390000000005
you could think of it as like

5969.32 --> 5975.799999999999
you you create the conditions for the

5972.56 --> 5979.0
ball lightning to come into being and

5975.8 --> 5982.1990000000005
then it just starts maintaining

5979.0 --> 5984.84
itself and using material and

5982.199 --> 5988.04
transforming it in the

5984.84 --> 5990.04
process until it runs out of energy or

5988.04 --> 5992.08
out of material or what yeah I don't

5990.04 --> 5994.5199999999995
exact details but you basically just

5992.08 --> 5996.92
conjure an elemental into being it

5994.52 --> 6000.679
starts changing the

5996.92 --> 6000.679
material until it

6000.88 --> 6005.28
dies low boy

6011.28 --> 6015.5199999999995
[Music]

6033.0 --> 6040.04
are you like originally vo nich because

6036.199 --> 6040.04
then I I think I know who you

6040.159 --> 6046.44
are yeah I blocked you a long time

6043.04 --> 6047.48
ago I blocked a lot of people things

6046.44 --> 6051.638999999999
have

6047.48 --> 6051.638999999999
changed we'll see where things go

6052.239 --> 6056.28
now for

6079.29 --> 6083.93
[Music]

6085.599 --> 6091.0
all right so again if anybody has any

6088.04 --> 6092.84
questions or wants me to explain this

6091.0 --> 6096.04
this is one of those things that you'll

6092.84 --> 6099.639
probably have to hear like 10 to 20

6096.04 --> 6102.32
times explained in an oversimplify over

6099.639 --> 6104.88
in a simplified way and getting the

6102.32 --> 6107.44
science fiction aberration nonsense out

6104.88 --> 6111.56
of it which is just

6107.44 --> 6113.919999999999
distracting just I'm here I'm going to

6111.56 --> 6118.0
be this is like now in my repertoire I'm

6113.92 --> 6118.0
going to be explaining

6120.32 --> 6125.32
this to those who are interested in

6123.119 --> 6128.239
transmutation because I have a way

6125.32 --> 6131.48
better understanding of it

6128.239 --> 6133.919999999999
now what is

6131.48 --> 6135.799999999999
involved I'm not an engineer so I don't

6133.92 --> 6136.76
know the det I wouldn't be able to like

6135.8 --> 6141.400000000001
make

6136.76 --> 6144.0
a or maybe with like assistance

6141.4 --> 6147.159
nah I'm not good enough with engineering

6144.0 --> 6150.159
and electricity to like be as precise as

6147.159 --> 6153.0
you would need to be to get a proper

6150.159 --> 6156.48
transmutation station

6153.0 --> 6156.48
happening but it

6157.04 --> 6162.5199999999995
exists and the charts are what they are

6160.48 --> 6165.4
and it could be

6162.52 --> 6168.040000000001
created and it probably has been created

6165.4 --> 6170.5199999999995
it's like a secret government facility

6168.04 --> 6173.28
like yeah I mean hey if you were

6170.52 --> 6175.88
literally just transmuting

6173.28 --> 6179.48
common materials into rare

6175.88 --> 6182.28
materials I freaking keep that a highly

6179.48 --> 6185.919999999999
classified secret as well because that's

6182.28 --> 6189.04
like very disruptive to the economy

6185.92 --> 6191.119
potentially like if that comes out

6189.04 --> 6193.28
officially like what are banks going to

6191.119 --> 6197.598999999999
do you know it's like yeah they're just

6193.28 --> 6199.759999999999
creating gold uh what does that mean for

6197.599 --> 6201.360000000001
the value of gold you

6199.76 --> 6205.599
know

6201.36 --> 6207.119
right so maybe they're not creating gold

6205.599 --> 6210.119000000001
maybe they're creating other materials

6207.119 --> 6210.119
that we don't even know

6216.8 --> 6222.8
about but I mean the potential

6220.36 --> 6225.839999999999
applications for this kind of technology

6222.8 --> 6229.52
is astounding like what if you could

6225.84 --> 6231.719
what if this is the key

6229.52 --> 6233.599
to True

6231.719 --> 6234.76
recycling right

6233.599 --> 6238.56
you need a

6234.76 --> 6240.8
material raw material that you can then

6238.56 --> 6243.52
based on the composition of that

6240.8 --> 6246.599
material apply a

6243.52 --> 6249.0
specific ball lightning

6246.599 --> 6250.599
towards at a certain time interval to

6249.0 --> 6254.04
have a change in material but what if

6250.599 --> 6256.56
you could like do it not with the idea

6254.04 --> 6259.44
of ending up with a specific material

6256.56 --> 6263.2390000000005
but instead what if you could like just

6259.44 --> 6265.598999999999
transform absolute junk like

6263.239 --> 6267.839999999999
a chemical that's only

6265.599 --> 6270.119000000001
detrimental like there's nothing

6267.84 --> 6272.08
positive you could do with it it's good

6270.119 --> 6273.92
if the world would be ridden of it and

6272.08 --> 6275.96
there like it's you can't chemically

6273.92 --> 6277.56
react it what if you could just take

6275.96 --> 6283.159
that substance

6277.56 --> 6285.119000000001
like what is also part of refining oil

6283.159 --> 6287.879999999999
turning it into gasoline like there is

6285.119 --> 6290.719
certain type of chemical side product

6287.88 --> 6293.719
with that that just keeps piling up

6290.719 --> 6293.719
forever

6294.32 --> 6299.159
what if you could take all that junk

6297.599 --> 6300.679
stuff that's just going to pollute

6299.159 --> 6303.839999999999
everything if it gets

6300.679 --> 6308.0
out and subject it to

6303.84 --> 6312.1990000000005
transmutation to transform it completely

6308.0 --> 6317.239
making it into somewhat or totally

6312.199 --> 6319.799999999999
viable usable new

6317.239 --> 6322.28
substances so you could turn something

6319.8 --> 6324.400000000001
that is just purely detrimental in every

6322.28 --> 6326.719
conceivable way it's only in the way

6324.4 --> 6329.119
only needs to be protected so that it

6326.719 --> 6333.44
doesn't pollute everything and

6329.119 --> 6336.5599999999995
transmutate it into less

6333.44 --> 6339.48
harmless materials or even useful

6336.56 --> 6343.119000000001
materials I mean that would be an

6339.48 --> 6343.119
immensely positive

6343.4 --> 6348.199
application it would enable us to

6345.639 --> 6352.8
suddenly get rid

6348.199 --> 6352.799999999999
of chemical waste

6353.88 --> 6357.639
and maybe even get something

6355.48 --> 6361.08
constructive out of it like could you

6357.639 --> 6366.04
believe that the the

6361.08 --> 6366.04
potential unique application for this

6366.159 --> 6370.96
is

6367.96 --> 6370.96
just

6379.04 --> 6384.0
immense I mean can you imagine all these

6381.679 --> 6387.28
countries having

6384.0 --> 6390.92
giant underground warehouses full with

6387.28 --> 6393.199
toxic waste from

6390.92 --> 6395.2390000000005
industry and like nobody blames them

6393.199 --> 6397.32
it's just like yeah that's unfortunate

6395.239 --> 6400.08
side effect of this industry we don't

6397.32 --> 6402.36
know what to do about it and we try not

6400.08 --> 6403.8
to like dump it in rivers or anything

6402.36 --> 6406.32
because that will just destroy

6403.8 --> 6407.92
everything so we're just stockpiling it

6406.32 --> 6411.599
what if suddenly like a country is like

6407.92 --> 6413.92
hey we have a mega transmutation

6411.599 --> 6416.2390000000005
Transformer here

6413.92 --> 6419.28
we're going to like give us your junk

6416.239 --> 6420.36
I'll we'll we'll take it at first

6419.28 --> 6424.04
they'll take

6420.36 --> 6426.08
it like for free and then eventually

6424.04 --> 6428.639
when everybody figures out like what's

6426.08 --> 6432.04
happening they'll probably ask money for

6428.639 --> 6433.84
it then was like we want like a little

6432.04 --> 6435.96
bit of money for this

6433.84 --> 6437.639
junk because you're getting something

6435.96 --> 6440.599
useful out of

6437.639 --> 6443.599
it and then just everybody sends their

6440.599 --> 6446.0
toxic waste to very specific specific

6443.599 --> 6449.96
location where there's just

6446.0 --> 6452.96
this vast monolithic structure that's

6449.96 --> 6455.719
just a giant Tesla coil like thing or

6452.96 --> 6459.4800000000005
whatever a giant lightning ball machine

6455.719 --> 6459.4800000000005
and it's just like yeah pour in the

6459.96 --> 6465.28
[ __ ] it's like oh it's transformed next

6463.56 --> 6468.159000000001
batch pour it

6465.28 --> 6470.4
in it's just transforming it all day

6468.159 --> 6472.839999999999
long transforming it all day long and

6470.4 --> 6475.159
just like yeah pour the chemical w

6472.84 --> 6477.159000000001
placed in on this side and on the other

6475.159 --> 6480.638999999999
side you get raw materials of a

6477.159 --> 6484.0
different nature that we can actually

6480.639 --> 6487.679
recycle and suddenly it's like

6484.0 --> 6489.679
yeah no more toxic

6487.679 --> 6492.719
waste

6489.679 --> 6496.08
pileups from chemical industry how about

6492.719 --> 6498.08
that yeah that's one of the

6496.08 --> 6500.639
applications that you could get out of

6498.08 --> 6503.639
this i' I've been dreaming about this

6500.639 --> 6506.32
for quite a while this has been like a

6503.639 --> 6510.159000000001
childhood vision of

6506.32 --> 6514.4
mine a transmutation process to get rid

6510.159 --> 6514.4
of intable chemical

6515.48 --> 6523.839999999999
waste this could be

6518.599 --> 6523.84
it this could be the way to do that

6532.39 --> 6535.569
[Music]

6537.599 --> 6541.4800000000005
but I guess nobody gives a [ __ ] I mean

6540.52 --> 6544.2390000000005
oh it's

6541.48 --> 6546.199
only World transforming I mean there's

6544.239 --> 6549.199
no need to say anything for 10 minutes

6546.199 --> 6549.199
straight right after

6549.48 --> 6553.879999999999
that it's Sunday nobody

6557.32 --> 6563.5199999999995
cares I mean I'm only talking about like

6561.36 --> 6565.199
the greatest

6563.52 --> 6567.92
actual

6565.199 --> 6571.638999999999
environmental positive development that

6567.92 --> 6574.52
Humanity could ever conceive of in the

6571.639 --> 6577.56
history of the world that's all I mean

6574.52 --> 6582.040000000001
why would you comment on that

6577.56 --> 6582.04
right that's not noteworthy

6595.8 --> 6600.28
maybe I'll just round out the

6598.199 --> 6604.32
show how about

6600.28 --> 6604.32
that just stop talking about

6607.71 --> 6610.84
[Music]

6621.639 --> 6624.639
it

6651.639 --> 6654.639
for

6681.56 --> 6684.56
e

6711.52 --> 6715.56
e for

6721.34 --> 6724.39
[Music]

6735.36 --> 6738.469999999999
[Music]

6744.07 --> 6747.2
[Music]

6753.54 --> 6756.72
[Music]

6798.66 --> 6801.87
[Music]

6808.679 --> 6813.599
I'm around just nothing to add really

6810.48 --> 6813.598999999999
for 15 minutes

6829.0 --> 6833.56
nothing I mean I'm not sure what's going

6831.76 --> 6836.52
on here right now now

6833.56 --> 6840.04
uh like whether you're just all falling

6836.52 --> 6844.159000000001
asleep or whether your mind is so blown

6840.04 --> 6846.76
that you you have lost for words like I

6844.159 --> 6848.92
don't know I can't tell the

6846.76 --> 6851.079000000001
difference I can't tell the difference

6848.92 --> 6851.079
you

6856.48 --> 6863.239
know I'm not just talking to you clutch

6860.119 --> 6865.079
it's fine but I mean seriously though I

6863.239 --> 6866.159
mean I've just said a bunch of things

6865.079 --> 6868.199
that

6866.159 --> 6871.48
are quite

6868.199 --> 6874.48
big and like 50 minutes of Silence from

6871.48 --> 6874.48
everybody like

6874.56 --> 6880.4400000000005
what but maybe yeah maybe it is just so

6878.4 --> 6884.44
mind-blowing that nobody knows what to

6880.44 --> 6886.48
say I can't I can never really tell the

6884.44 --> 6890.5599999999995
difference because if nobody says

6886.48 --> 6890.5599999999995
anything then how do I know

6922.26 --> 6925.459
[Music]

6933.52 --> 6937.96
you anything to say voy when you just

6936.119 --> 6940.92
showed

6937.96 --> 6944.32
up you're thanking me for unblocking you

6940.92 --> 6944.32
but then you don't say

6947.92 --> 6953.119
anything don't know what clear is up to

6950.639 --> 6956.96
I mean FS is like working with the

6953.119 --> 6960.5199999999995
painting and all that he has an excuse

6956.96 --> 6960.52
LG I don't know what you're

6965.079 --> 6969.44
doing yeah no

6969.84 --> 6976.119000000001
no and you're out of here you're not

6972.639 --> 6976.119
part of the show

7002.079 --> 7007.119
you're just listening to the show like a

7004.04 --> 7010.599
radio yeah I guess you are I I guess

7007.119 --> 7010.598999999999
it's just not interactive

7011.239 --> 7016.799999999999
anymore to meia tells me that the time

7014.88 --> 7019.1990000000005
of the Flat Earth early bir show with

7016.8 --> 7024.56
the interactive chat is coming to an

7019.199 --> 7024.5599999999995
end cuz this is happening too

7041.159 --> 7045.159
regularly for

7072.52 --> 7075.92
oh just play the

7085.239 --> 7094.959999999999
video If a person is listening yeah it's

7089.199 --> 7094.96
just it's just not what I do though you

7096.239 --> 7101.678999999999
know like I never do that

7111.76 --> 7115.639
like I don't review

7119.76 --> 7126.320000000001
videos I talk about them I'll link you

7122.76 --> 7128.0
up to it but I don't review them on my

7126.32 --> 7132.759999999999
show I don't like just play other

7128.0 --> 7136.32
people's videos and give commentary like

7132.76 --> 7140.76
I've never done that in over 1900 shows

7136.32 --> 7140.759999999999
I never have and never needed

7143.32 --> 7148.32
to I'm in a background transmuting the

7145.96 --> 7151.719
show into a painting okay that's

7148.32 --> 7155.119
cool you keep it up I mean I don't have

7151.719 --> 7159.88
any issues with you fibs you've been

7155.119 --> 7159.88
very onto it with me in the subject

7177.28 --> 7180.28
right

7198.56 --> 7201.56
h

7234.719 --> 7240.36
so anything else anything else

7267.599 --> 7272.92
oh I got some more pseudo science

7270.48 --> 7274.0
nonsense stories for you though and

7272.92 --> 7277.1990000000005
they're

7274.0 --> 7283.4
resurfacing yes didn't you know there's

7277.199 --> 7286.32
an ocean 700 km deep into the Earth

7283.4 --> 7290.199
yes of course

7286.32 --> 7295.04
because I'm sure they they actually dug

7290.199 --> 7297.5199999999995
700 km deep to be certain of it or oh no

7295.04 --> 7303.599
they used p waves and S

7297.52 --> 7306.400000000001
waves didn't they they use seismic

7303.599 --> 7308.28
scanning oh what's the one thing about

7306.4 --> 7311.119
seismic

7308.28 --> 7316.28
scanning see there's an issue with that

7311.119 --> 7319.48
h could it be that they're always

7316.28 --> 7322.36
wrong every time they tested a

7319.48 --> 7326.28
prediction using p waves and s-waves and

7322.36 --> 7330.28
then they dug to that depth to see what

7326.28 --> 7332.92
was there they always were wrong but I

7330.28 --> 7335.639
mean we could definitely just trust them

7332.92 --> 7338.4400000000005
on their stories like oh 700 km deep I

7335.639 --> 7341.88
mean we can't even get right what's like

7338.44 --> 7345.119
10 km deep at all like complet

7341.88 --> 7347.2390000000005
completely off but you could trust us we

7345.119 --> 7349.36
know what 700 km deep and there's

7347.239 --> 7352.678999999999
definitely like an entire ocean of water

7349.36 --> 7356.839999999999
there right in the earth you could trust

7352.679 --> 7356.84
us we're we're science

7358.04 --> 7364.159
science right I mean we're only basing

7361.44 --> 7365.678999999999
that conclusion on a technology that

7364.159 --> 7368.0
when we try

7365.679 --> 7372.0
to

7368.0 --> 7375.4
test the results at even 10 km deep we

7372.0 --> 7377.159
were completely wrong every single time

7375.4 --> 7378.96
we physically tested it I mean but you

7377.159 --> 7382.92
could definitely trust that we're right

7378.96 --> 7385.92
about the 700 kilm deep

7382.92 --> 7385.92
absolutely

7400.36 --> 7407.598999999999
right and in to

7403.76 --> 7410.56
do just with lad

7407.599 --> 7415.88
cation releasing to do this oh what does

7410.56 --> 7415.88
that mean LG hello Nathan R good to see

7421.599 --> 7427.84
you yeah now there

7424.36 --> 7431.839999999999
is to some extent transmutation

7427.84 --> 7433.96
happening naturally apparently

7431.84 --> 7438.1990000000005
and it has to do with like the yeah the

7433.96 --> 7441.92
water living water again it's involved

7438.199 --> 7441.919999999999
within the understanding of

7443.28 --> 7448.44
transmutation so there may literally be

7446.239 --> 7452.199
like within

7448.44 --> 7455.4
life living Beating Heart might actually

7452.199 --> 7457.28
have a alchemical

7455.4 --> 7458.92
transmutative

7457.28 --> 7462.719
effect

7458.92 --> 7466.639
on on your blood

7462.719 --> 7470.4
and on things that you eat transmutation

7466.639 --> 7473.2390000000005
May potentially even be just a standard

7470.4 --> 7477.598999999999
biochemical effect that occurs in order

7473.239 --> 7477.598999999999
for you to have a normal metabolism

7497.079 --> 7502.639
are they saying they do this all with

7500.599 --> 7505.639
water

7502.639 --> 7505.639
citation

7506.88 --> 7509.88
uh

7515.36 --> 7523.639
no transmuting sunlight into calories no

7519.36 --> 7523.639
like that makes no damn sense fibs

7526.8 --> 7537.28
yeah besides calories are

7531.76 --> 7540.639
bioorganic substance not Atomic

7537.28 --> 7541.719
substance uh transmutation can't be used

7540.639 --> 7543.76
to

7541.719 --> 7547.639
create

7543.76 --> 7551.04
bio substances like complex organic

7547.639 --> 7554.4800000000005
molecules it doesn't do that it's not on

7551.04 --> 7554.48
the chart it's

7555.28 --> 7560.559
Elementary so you're never going to use

7557.88 --> 7563.400000000001
a transmutator

7560.559 --> 7566.320000000001
transmutation machine to create food it

7563.4 --> 7566.32
doesn't work like

7567.88 --> 7574.1990000000005
that you can create raw materials that

7570.52 --> 7578.88
you could use in agriculture for example

7574.199 --> 7578.879999999999
probably but you can't actually create

7580.559 --> 7583.559
food

7610.52 --> 7614.559
for for

7644.48 --> 7647.799999999999
but yeah LSG I mean yeah the

7646.239 --> 7650.759999999999
implications

7647.8 --> 7653.079000000001
applications profound doesn't even begin

7650.76 --> 7653.079000000001
to

7653.199 --> 7658.598999999999
describe describe that it

7656.079 --> 7661.159
is literally World

7658.599 --> 7666.28
transforming literally totally

7661.159 --> 7666.28
transforming transforming everything

7671.639 --> 7677.32
right but in order to basically figure

7675.28 --> 7679.599
out the long-term industrial

7677.32 --> 7683.159
applications for something like this you

7679.599 --> 7685.32
would have to test it and just see what

7683.159 --> 7687.679
what's the input what's the output what

7685.32 --> 7689.04
are the materials you're left with

7687.679 --> 7691.8
you're going to of course want to have

7689.04 --> 7695.079
the very precious things out of that but

7691.8 --> 7698.1990000000005
what are like the

7695.079 --> 7699.679
unavoidable chemical residues like what

7698.199 --> 7701.119
are the substances you're going to get

7699.679 --> 7702.079
out of it that are only going to be in

7701.119 --> 7705.0
the way

7702.079 --> 7709.159
right that's something that needs to be

7705.0 --> 7711.84
considered before you start industrially

7709.159 --> 7714.119
applying this kind of thing on a vast

7711.84 --> 7715.92
scale you need to know what is going to

7714.119 --> 7721.0
be the

7715.92 --> 7721.0
side waste of it that is

7725.92 --> 7731.0
inevitable right I mean if you're going

7727.8 --> 7733.4800000000005
to like do transmutation and all kinds

7731.0 --> 7738.96
of things and you end up like with

7733.48 --> 7742.199
this death stuff like black goo what

7738.96 --> 7745.599
something this just a weird example but

7742.199 --> 7749.44
like some substance that then once the

7745.599 --> 7751.719
transmutation creates it it can't be

7749.44 --> 7753.759999999999
transformed anymore like once it's in

7751.719 --> 7756.599
that state it cannot be altered and it

7753.76 --> 7759.52
will always be that stuff and you keep

7756.599 --> 7762.88
accumulating more of it and it's really

7759.52 --> 7765.119000000001
toxic yeah is something like

7762.88 --> 7767.52
that because then you know okay you

7765.119 --> 7769.48
could transmute stuff it's really

7767.52 --> 7773.76
amazingly efficient

7769.48 --> 7774.678999999999
but you end up with yet another toxic

7773.76 --> 7778.8
waste

7774.679 --> 7782.4
buildup that you cannot decrease it and

7778.8 --> 7784.4800000000005
you can't use it so another toxic waste

7782.4 --> 7786.96
I mean it'll solve a whole bunch of

7784.48 --> 7790.638999999999
other toxic waste

7786.96 --> 7792.639
problems for sure but are you going to

7790.639 --> 7795.679
have a bill up of new toxic waste that

7792.639 --> 7798.52
the transmutation process can't alter

7795.679 --> 7802.96
once that stuff gets created as a side

7798.52 --> 7802.96
effect these things need to be figured

7806.04 --> 7809.04
out

7813.239 --> 7817.239
Infinium okay

7824.199 --> 7827.96
maybe this

7858.639 --> 7864.92
I'm I'm not really like all enthusiastic

7862.0 --> 7866.52
about naming more things though yeah I

7864.92 --> 7870.079
think that's not so we shouldn't

7866.52 --> 7871.52
prioritize naming things rather than

7870.079 --> 7874.679
understanding the full-blown

7871.52 --> 7877.639
implications of trying to

7874.679 --> 7882.079
industrialize something like

7877.639 --> 7882.079
transmutation should be understood

7883.44 --> 7886.678999999999
what are the long-term

7903.32 --> 7908.4
consequences have they done with this

7913.159 --> 7915.44
all

7915.92 --> 7920.2390000000005
kinds different types of metal including

7918.719 --> 7923.84
precious metal

7920.239 --> 7923.839999999999
and and even

7929.0 --> 7935.76
carbon so yeah I mean in

7931.96 --> 7938.44
that that one video of plasmoids they do

7935.76 --> 7941.4800000000005
go through like samples of this

7938.44 --> 7943.839999999999
transmutation process

7941.48 --> 7945.839999999999
and then point out certain things that

7943.84 --> 7947.76
prove that transmutation definitely

7945.84 --> 7950.4800000000005
happened because and they end up with

7947.76 --> 7952.079000000001
materials that literally are incapable

7950.48 --> 7955.879999999999
of naturally

7952.079 --> 7955.88
forming through basic

7956.96 --> 7962.599
chemistry and yet they are there that's

7960.44 --> 7964.759999999999
what what that part of that video was

7962.599 --> 7968.32
about uh I don't

7964.76 --> 7970.360000000001
know what the ranges of materials that

7968.32 --> 7972.799999999999
they have thus for created with

7970.36 --> 7975.32
transmutation

7972.8 --> 7978.0
but I mean if you look at that chart

7975.32 --> 7980.84
that I showed earlier it seems like

7978.0 --> 7984.96
pretty much every conceivable

7980.84 --> 7984.96
element can be created with

7998.32 --> 8001.96
it right all depending on the exact

8000.679 --> 8005.119
circumstance

8001.96 --> 8007.639
ances like how long are you going to

8005.119 --> 8010.28
have the process

8007.639 --> 8012.719
last because apparently it the

8010.28 --> 8015.44
transformation is like a cycle over time

8012.719 --> 8018.28
like a roulette between what the end

8015.44 --> 8021.119
result will be based on how long the

8018.28 --> 8024.239
process is going so you you have to then

8021.119 --> 8026.719
time it carefully in order to get a very

8024.239 --> 8028.32
specific material end result that seems

8026.719 --> 8031.2390000000005
to be how it

8028.32 --> 8032.558999999999
works that the timing of the trans

8031.239 --> 8034.079
mutation is everything and if you're

8032.559 --> 8035.92
like off with the timing you could just

8034.079 --> 8038.92
have a completely different material end

8035.92 --> 8038.92
result

8090.04 --> 8093.04
that

8119.96 --> 8123.96
for for

8145.77 --> 8148.839000000001
[Music]

8163.26 --> 8166.499
[Music]

8179.92 --> 8183.88
that for

8213.399 --> 8217.08
just show the damn

8218.08 --> 8222.639
video just trying to check out ball

8220.519 --> 8225.319
lightning but I mean it's just like oh

8222.639 --> 8226.559
oh we're so interesting oh you want to

8225.319 --> 8229.639
look at the ball

8226.559 --> 8231.8
lightning oh well here you have to like

8229.639 --> 8234.279999999999
first endure our

8231.8 --> 8236.24
[ __ ] blah blah blah blah blah oh

8234.28 --> 8238.439
we're so interesting and we're it's

8236.24 --> 8241.88
going to be a real hassle to actually

8238.439 --> 8245.0
get the footage of the ball lightning

8241.88 --> 8245.0
that's what we're dealing with

8253.319 --> 8257.399
now let's

8255.359 --> 8260.800000000001
see a

8257.399 --> 8263.8
collection just have to Wade through our

8260.8 --> 8263.8
[ __ ]

8272.2 --> 8280.12
so let's get to the actual ball

8276.8 --> 8283.639
lightning god damn it it's

8280.12 --> 8283.639000000001
all what the

8291.519 --> 8294.84
[ __ ] that's

8298.479 --> 8304.599
cool sure this

8302.479 --> 8308.84
right so this is an example of ball

8304.599 --> 8308.84
lightning just grabbing this off

8320.679 --> 8327.559
YouTube right so here's some lightning

8324.92 --> 8329.2
on the right and then a ball lightning

8327.559 --> 8333.319
just spawns

8329.2 --> 8338.08
forth and rolls out just look at

8333.319 --> 8338.08
this see that that's a ball

8338.639 --> 8345.559
lightning apparently

8341.76 --> 8348.24
this ah there's a ball lightning yeah

8345.559 --> 8348.24
freaky as

8351.04 --> 8356.719000000001
hell so that's naturally occurring

8364.319 --> 8370.84
you imagine that just lands in your

8366.24 --> 8370.84
backyard or something that's freaky as

8372.76 --> 8378.519
hell you could think like did an angel

8375.719 --> 8378.518999999998
just land there or

8378.84 --> 8386.8
something yeah ball lightning

8383.359 --> 8389.359
weird naturally occurring and

8386.8 --> 8391.399
effectively

8389.359 --> 8395.6
that's what

8391.399 --> 8395.599999999999
they try to artificially

8396.56 --> 8402.96
create because that specific process

8400.399 --> 8405.88
that basically keeps that ball lightning

8402.96 --> 8409.279999999999
as a ball lightning is part of what

8405.88 --> 8409.279999999999
causes transmutation

8421.56 --> 8424.6
all right you want to take a look at the

8423.12 --> 8428.04
video that I just

8424.6 --> 8428.04
showed here it

8428.08 --> 8434.8
is just something I quickly looked up on

8432.04 --> 8437.800000000001
YouTube another a long video with some

8434.8 --> 8437.8
footage

8476.2 --> 8479.2
crazy

8481.359 --> 8485.720000000001
maybe it's just amazing I mean this is

8483.84 --> 8488.72
just

8485.72 --> 8488.72
Nature's

8496.24 --> 8500.76
awesomeness right anyway I hope you all

8498.439 --> 8502.880000000001
appreciate the show thus far it's been

8500.76 --> 8505.72
very

8502.88 --> 8508.839999999998
themed and

8505.72 --> 8511.16
uh big development I'd say big

8508.84 --> 8512.64
progression in my understanding

8511.16 --> 8515.2
if you like the show then don't forget

8512.64 --> 8517.08
to Rogan it up and maybe become part of

8515.2 --> 8519.2
my

8517.08 --> 8522.6
patreon maybe support me through the

8519.2 --> 8525.12
PayPal that would be

8522.6 --> 8528.359
great love to keep going I mean I'm

8525.12 --> 8532.04
going to dig more into this kind of

8528.359 --> 8532.04
thing try to keep

8536.84 --> 8546.16
tabs and help people to to avoid these

8541.92 --> 8549.8
aberration thinking pitfalls it's what I

8546.16 --> 8552.399
do right that's why it's specifically in

8549.8 --> 8556.279999999999
the title ball lightning plasmoid

8552.399 --> 8558.76
transmutation not ether or

8556.28 --> 8562.399000000001
SpaceTime because that has just

8558.76 --> 8562.399
absolutely nothing to do with

8564.64 --> 8572.56
it even though they do draw it

8569.16 --> 8575.039999999999
in they get hyper theoretical and then

8572.56 --> 8579.16
they draw in these terminologies and

8575.04 --> 8579.160000000002
then they'll get all like emotional over

8579.479 --> 8585.519999999999
it seriously like that happens

8582.72 --> 8587.84
in in the original plasmoid video they

8585.52 --> 8590.359
get all emotional over it and it's like

8587.84 --> 8593.84
and then start making claims oh space

8590.359 --> 8597.640000000001
travel finally so it is kind of

8593.84 --> 8601.16
nonsensical at at that part people

8597.64 --> 8604.039999999999
are misled through their

8601.16 --> 8606.96
personal beliefs but that doesn't

8604.04 --> 8610.560000000001
decrease from the actual practical

8606.96 --> 8613.64
results of this engineering development

8610.56 --> 8615.08
which is what it is it's a rediscovery

8613.64 --> 8617.479
of

8615.08 --> 8621.68
transmutation ball lightning plasmoid

8617.479 --> 8621.679999999998
based transmutation and that is very

8622.0 --> 8628.56
impressive and all

8625.8 --> 8630.08
their aberration based beliefs that they

8628.56 --> 8632.319
tie in with it I mean they will just

8630.08 --> 8634.359
evap separate and disappear like people

8632.319 --> 8636.68
will eventually know like oh yeah that's

8634.359 --> 8638.76
just nonsense it's not important though

8636.68 --> 8640.68
it's not important that they do that

8638.76 --> 8643.800000000001
that it is nonsense what they say about

8640.68 --> 8646.0
it because the effect is there it's

8643.8 --> 8648.199999999999
provably there it's engineered they

8646.0 --> 8650.72
mapped it doesn't matter whether they

8648.2 --> 8653.279
call it space time because it's

8650.72 --> 8653.278999999999
completely

8654.24 --> 8658.8
irrelevant it's an

8656.68 --> 8661.359
engineering

8658.8 --> 8665.08
blueprint and it works

8661.359 --> 8667.640000000001
it works in a specific way then why it

8665.08 --> 8670.0
works well they reason out all space

8667.64 --> 8672.0
time yeah that's just nonsense it's not

8670.0 --> 8674.8
relevant

8672.0 --> 8679.08
either it's engineering they figured out

8674.8 --> 8682.438999999998
how it worked to a very fine detail

8679.08 --> 8686.52
that's impressive now

8682.439 --> 8686.52
why is

8686.76 --> 8692.880000000001
irrelevant why does it all work that way

8689.12 --> 8696.800000000001
yeah unification theory is

8692.88 --> 8698.839999999998
irrelevant and misleading it always is

8696.8 --> 8702.08
every form of unification theory has

8698.84 --> 8705.0
thus far been very

8702.08 --> 8708.08
misleading like it's never unification

8705.0 --> 8711.76
Theory never lasts everybody that does

8708.08 --> 8714.56
it always ends up with broken systems

8711.76 --> 8718.16
inconsistencies getting ignored over

8714.56 --> 8718.16
it because it doesn't

8719.319 --> 8724.0
work you can be emotionally highly

8722.12 --> 8726.04
convinced that it does and it's really

8724.0 --> 8729.56
important but it isn't and it will not

8726.04 --> 8734.359
last a test of time every time

8729.56 --> 8737.72
yeah stick to practical

8734.359 --> 8740.56
results that's the best you could

8737.72 --> 8745.16
do leave your

8740.56 --> 8749.479
unification ideas and convictions out of

8745.16 --> 8753.279
it and if all possible especially leave

8749.479 --> 8755.039999999999
out sudo scientific terminologies to try

8753.279 --> 8759.800000000001
to

8755.04 --> 8761.76
explain why these new charts and things

8759.8 --> 8764.199999999999
work the way they do I mean it's in your

8761.76 --> 8768.6
own best interest on the long run you're

8764.2 --> 8768.6
not helping yourself doing

8768.8 --> 8773.64
that I mean you're no doubt you're still

8771.359 --> 8777.399000000001
going to do that I mean they're all Ken

8773.64 --> 8779.72
wheeler fans so they're all caught up in

8777.399 --> 8781.0
this they make it their own personal

8779.72 --> 8783.0
religion

8781.0 --> 8786.12
like that that's what they those people

8783.0 --> 8788.72
seem to do they all seem to go along

8786.12 --> 8790.2
with it but I mean that is Priestly

8788.72 --> 8795.84
Behavior

8790.2 --> 8798.399000000001
though it's not rational it's not fully

8795.84 --> 8801.319
honest with themselves it's not like oh

8798.399 --> 8804.08
we're lying to the public no it's it's

8801.319 --> 8805.96
their illusion they believe it they hold

8804.08 --> 8809.76
on to

8805.96 --> 8811.24
it like as if it is a a Priestly

8809.76 --> 8813.52
knowledge

8811.24 --> 8815.479
but it's mostly Priestly chance that

8813.52 --> 8818.52
when you logically think about it it

8815.479 --> 8821.72
makes no sense yeah if you end up saying

8818.52 --> 8825.6
space is time time is space then you

8821.72 --> 8828.16
know you're chanting like a

8825.6 --> 8831.2
[ __ ] if you think about it logically

8828.16 --> 8834.24
unless you have this Priestly Sensation

8831.2 --> 8837.04
that you found the key what the key to

8834.24 --> 8837.039999999999
being completely

8838.08 --> 8842.92
nonsensical yeah it doesn't achieve

8839.96 --> 8845.599999999999
anything to say anything like that but I

8842.92 --> 8848.56
mean hey the results are the results

8845.6 --> 8852.08
though those are palpable those are very

8848.56 --> 8855.6
impressive very precious precious

8852.08 --> 8858.279
knowledge no need to draw in any of this

8855.6 --> 8861.84
pseudo scientific

8858.279 --> 8863.359
phraseology especially for

8861.84 --> 8867.359
this

8863.359 --> 8869.640000000001
pointless attempt of a unification

8867.359 --> 8872.12
Theory of Everything like it is

8869.64 --> 8872.119999999999
pointless

8872.279 --> 8877.08
and will remain pointless like it will

8874.56 --> 8879.64
never be achieved no matter how advanced

8877.08 --> 8883.72
technology will become unification will

8879.64 --> 8887.199999999999
never be achieved because it's not

8883.72 --> 8890.199999999999
there physical reality doesn't work that

8887.2 --> 8890.2
way

8897.78 --> 8900.939
[Music]

8901.16 --> 8907.8
how do you harness it what a ball

8904.399 --> 8911.88
lightning well a a free ball lightning

8907.8 --> 8911.88
that naturally occurs you don't harness

8913.319 --> 8918.199999999999
it you might be able to have like a

8915.8 --> 8919.88
system that will attract ball Lightnings

8918.2 --> 8922.84
and that they will always go there and

8919.88 --> 8924.278999999999
get absorbed or whatever but I mean if

8922.84 --> 8927.479
it's naturally occurring you don't

8924.279 --> 8931.960000000001
harness it ili is it's kind of

8927.479 --> 8934.039999999999
unpredictable and rare but you can

8931.96 --> 8935.24
create ball lightning and that's what

8934.04 --> 8938.240000000002
they do with

8935.24 --> 8938.24
this

8951.359 --> 8957.84
machine so

8954.16 --> 8960.319
they create through a man-made device a

8957.84 --> 8962.279
controlled ball lightning

8960.319 --> 8964.92
very specific surrounding so it doesn't

8962.279 --> 8970.12
just like bolt out of the machine it's

8964.92 --> 8970.12
exists within the machine until it's

8970.6 --> 8975.08
depleted and

8972.319 --> 8977.6
then you

8975.08 --> 8979.92
subject the ball lightning as it's

8977.6 --> 8982.52
forming to certain material that then

8979.92 --> 8984.72
gets drawn in and

8982.52 --> 8988.84
transmuted and that's what it is that's

8984.72 --> 8988.84
that machine that's what it does

8994.399 --> 8999.56
if you can harness it oh that that's a

8997.479 --> 9002.16
completely pointless statement there

8999.56 --> 9006.68
extra pixels very

9002.16 --> 9006.68
typical low buck sodbuster

9047.52 --> 9051.92
are you wrong yeah you are wrong

9052.68 --> 9057.2
yeah well

9054.6 --> 9059.0
lightning can be harnessed is harnessed

9057.2 --> 9061.12
that's what they do with the machine I

9059.0 --> 9064.479
just explain it as you were blabbering

9061.12 --> 9064.479000000001
out your irrelevant

9064.76 --> 9073.319
statement yeah all I said is a naturally

9071.08 --> 9076.12
occurring ball lightninging that

9073.319 --> 9080.519999999999
suddenly pops up out of nowhere yeah you

9076.12 --> 9082.479000000001
can harness that and you don't need to

9080.52 --> 9084.0
CU they're very rare

9082.479 --> 9087.0
anyway

9084.0 --> 9090.08
like natural ball Lightnings are

9087.0 --> 9093.84
unpredictable rare and

9090.08 --> 9093.84
dangerous known to be

9094.56 --> 9100.519999999999
dangerous lethal potentially yeah and

9097.68 --> 9100.52
how they move is

9100.84 --> 9105.359
unpredictable

9102.88 --> 9106.96
so that's not what they do with the

9105.359 --> 9109.08
machine that's not what they do they

9106.96 --> 9110.519999999999
don't care about naturally occurring

9109.08 --> 9112.84
ball lightning

9110.52 --> 9115.479000000001
that you then capture somehow and try to

9112.84 --> 9119.24
do your transmutation with no they

9115.479 --> 9121.84
create it from scratch in their machine

9119.24 --> 9122.6
they allow a ball lightning to form in

9121.84 --> 9125.319
their

9122.6 --> 9127.24
machine and then it is in a very

9125.319 --> 9129.359
controlled environment so that it

9127.24 --> 9133.6
doesn't just leap out of the machine and

9129.359 --> 9133.6
just wildly go over places

9140.16 --> 9145.76
that's right so you can harness

9141.68 --> 9145.76
artificial ones exactly

9181.2 --> 9185.399000000001
you never heard of ball lightning wow I

9183.92 --> 9188.88
can't believe

9185.399 --> 9190.88
it how could that have avoided you for

9188.88 --> 9193.358999999999
such a long time I mean I learned about

9190.88 --> 9198.64
ball lightning when I was

9193.359 --> 9198.640000000001
12 it's like pre- internet era

9201.24 --> 9206.279
and I learned about lightning based

9203.56 --> 9208.08
transm or heavy electricity based

9206.279 --> 9210.479000000001
transmutation didn't know involved the

9208.08 --> 9213.84
ball lightning effect had no idea what

9210.479 --> 9215.039999999999
the hell that even was really just that

9213.84 --> 9217.359
it's weird and

9215.04 --> 9219.880000000001
unpredictable but I learned about it in

9217.359 --> 9224.08
2008 that there was transmutation

9219.88 --> 9224.08
possible using

9224.56 --> 9230.56
electricity and

9226.76 --> 9232.92
now that effect has been veloped and

9230.56 --> 9235.359
refined further to the point where now

9232.92 --> 9237.24
there's these videos showing you the

9235.359 --> 9239.24
chart exactly on like how the

9237.24 --> 9242.24
transmutation

9239.24 --> 9242.24
happens

9243.04 --> 9249.12
so but I mean I knew about ball

9245.279 --> 9249.12
lightning when I was 12

9274.24 --> 9278.68
trees pixels I don't even know who the

9276.279 --> 9278.68
hell you

9282.68 --> 9287.12
are there's no unpleasantries

9300.92 --> 9307.399
yeah you were wrong you asked am I wrong

9305.04 --> 9310.52
and then I say yeah you were

9307.399 --> 9313.199999999999
wrong cuz you just assumed oh they can't

9310.52 --> 9315.800000000001
harness it like you just assumed that

9313.2 --> 9318.439
even though I had already directly

9315.8 --> 9320.319
addressed that before you started saying

9318.439 --> 9322.720000000001
that that's

9320.319 --> 9323.68
annoying it's very annoying when people

9322.72 --> 9327.358999999999
do

9323.68 --> 9331.52
that when I just addressed it like

9327.359 --> 9333.76
within 3 minutes time and then suddenly

9331.52 --> 9337.12
you say something that just proves you

9333.76 --> 9337.12
didn't listen yeah that's

9337.68 --> 9345.52
annoying I'm sorry if if if that made me

9342.279 --> 9348.84
not oh I'm so happy you're here doing

9345.52 --> 9350.2
that extra pixels makes me so happy I'm

9348.84 --> 9353.2
sorry

9350.2 --> 9357.76
yeah sorry that I'm not receiving you

9353.2 --> 9359.800000000001
with with joy when you do that yeah no

9357.76 --> 9364.800000000001
point in complaining about it

9359.8 --> 9364.8
though yeah that just makes it even more

9376.6 --> 9380.56
annoying so what are all the

9378.319 --> 9383.96
pontifications on today yeah well maybe

9380.56 --> 9386.479
debatable D maybe just show up on time

9383.96 --> 9388.64
and not at the very end of the show I'm

9386.479 --> 9390.0
not going to give you a transcription of

9388.64 --> 9391.68
everything that happened in the show why

9390.0 --> 9396.88
don't you just go watch the show from

9391.68 --> 9396.880000000001
the start how about that

9435.88 --> 9440.599999999999
the old AR would have booted him five

9437.399 --> 9442.358999999999
minutes ago yeah probably

9440.6 --> 9445.800000000001
I don't know why you call that a Dave

9442.359 --> 9445.800000000001
wise chill

9489.2 --> 9493.76
hey debatable D you can enjoy whatever

9490.96 --> 9496.319
you like but I mean don't expect to me

9493.76 --> 9498.359
to just like summarize for you

9496.319 --> 9501.439
everything that I talked about in the

9498.359 --> 9501.439
last 2 and 1/2 hours

9503.479 --> 9506.319
doesn't work that

9506.72 --> 9511.599999999999
way right I mean already got a

9518.0 --> 9527.439
title there's tons of conversation you

9521.399 --> 9527.439
can scroll through maybe figure it out

9539.68 --> 9544.439
wise let people be stupid ahool and just

9542.279 --> 9548.560000000001
brushed it off who cares okay that's

9544.439 --> 9552.04
interesting buckbuster I wasn't aware of

9548.56 --> 9555.399
that but uh yeah I

9552.04 --> 9558.0
mean I'm not just going to brush it off

9555.399 --> 9559.56
I am going to address it there's some

9558.0 --> 9560.96
annoying Behavior I will point out

9559.56 --> 9563.479
exactly how it

9560.96 --> 9566.438999999998
is but I mean that doesn't automatically

9563.479 --> 9568.64
mean I'm going to kick somebody out now

9566.439 --> 9571.279
I'm going to give people some

9568.64 --> 9572.68
opportunity to correct themselves or

9571.279 --> 9575.16
give

9572.68 --> 9577.479000000001
recognition and if they then just make

9575.16 --> 9580.72
it worse then I will kick them out yeah

9577.479 --> 9580.72
I will definitely do

9581.2 --> 9588.16
that but now I just try

9585.64 --> 9592.358999999999
to point it out

9588.16 --> 9592.359
first and give him a bit of a

9611.479 --> 9616.119999999999
chance a summary would be nice to

9617.2 --> 9625.240000000002
know okay well

9620.76 --> 9625.24
the summary is in the title debatable

9626.479 --> 9632.76
D yeah talking about ball lightning

9630.08 --> 9635.72
plasmoid transmutation

9632.76 --> 9638.64
transmutation using

9635.72 --> 9641.72
electricity to transmute

9638.64 --> 9646.24
materials into other

9641.72 --> 9649.08
materials and a piece of developed

9646.24 --> 9650.52
engineering of people that have done

9649.08 --> 9652.84
that

9650.52 --> 9655.319000000001
and in the video that I Linked UP

9652.84 --> 9659.16
multiple times that's basically what

9655.319 --> 9663.439
this is about and I have commentary too

9659.16 --> 9666.119999999999
about yeah nonsense talk concerning

9663.439 --> 9668.64
ether and SpaceTime and can wheeler

9666.12 --> 9671.880000000001
references which are in that

9668.64 --> 9674.16
video and even people that believe like

9671.88 --> 9677.92
oh we could use this

9674.16 --> 9681.039999999999
transmutation to do do space travel like

9677.92 --> 9683.319
there is nonsense references in there

9681.04 --> 9685.2
but that doesn't technically detract

9683.319 --> 9688.119999999999
from the engineering that has been

9685.2 --> 9688.12
developed which is

9689.88 --> 9695.839999999998
astounding so I hope that summarizes the

9693.319 --> 9695.84
subject

9698.359 --> 9704.0
overall do I have an understanding how

9700.92 --> 9706.319
the thunderstorm machine thing works no

9704.0 --> 9706.319
not

9707.04 --> 9713.2
really just that it is kind of

9709.84 --> 9716.0
a a complicated process it's not just

9713.2 --> 9720.800000000001
basically oh just turn on the

9716.0 --> 9723.6
power it has to do with oscillation

9720.8 --> 9728.479
and it is complicated electro

9723.6 --> 9728.479000000001
engineering so it's not my specialty at

9729.439 --> 9736.04
all but I mean in the video they do try

9733.72 --> 9740.039999999999
to explain how it

9736.04 --> 9743.479000000001
works it's just that I can't really

9740.04 --> 9746.319000000001
absorb that all that well but they have

9743.479 --> 9749.519999999999
like specialized videos that they

9746.319 --> 9751.319
haven't like looked into where they do

9749.52 --> 9752.6
probably explain exactly how that

9751.319 --> 9758.0
machine

9752.6 --> 9758.0
works like how to build one

9762.76 --> 9767.64
technically you can do with some science

9765.8 --> 9770.16
yeah well that's not

9767.64 --> 9773.358999999999
this debatable

9770.16 --> 9774.96
this is not science fiction

9773.359 --> 9776.479000000001
entertainment

9774.96 --> 9780.919999999998
it's

9776.479 --> 9784.039999999999
just information pollution in between

9780.92 --> 9785.960000000001
the amazing engineering discoveries

9784.04 --> 9788.04
that's what that is it's not

9785.96 --> 9791.679999999998
entertainment yeah delusions aren't

9788.04 --> 9796.68
entertaining they're delusional they're

9791.68 --> 9796.68
distracting they make things difficult

9810.2 --> 9818.12
what space time just defines where

9813.04 --> 9818.12
something is at at a specific time

9823.72 --> 9831.0
no that that's not what space time is

9827.04 --> 9831.0
defined at at all

9841.76 --> 9848.04
right the point is they utilize it

9844.16 --> 9852.68
within a diagram because of

9848.04 --> 9854.800000000001
the the time the timing timing is a

9852.68 --> 9857.56
critical component in

9854.8 --> 9859.24
transmutation have one material and turn

9857.56 --> 9861.319
the machine on and then depending on

9859.24 --> 9864.24
when you're going to turn it off very

9861.319 --> 9867.359
precisely

9864.24 --> 9870.199999999999
depends on that on that timing depends

9867.359 --> 9873.68
the material range that's going to be

9870.2 --> 9876.359
transmuted out of it that's just the

9873.68 --> 9880.16
Practical side of it and that has

9876.359 --> 9884.439
absolutely nothing to do with SpaceTime

9880.16 --> 9889.2
or SpaceTime bending or gravity at all

9884.439 --> 9889.2
it's just called timing

9918.279 --> 9922.880000000001
that time is not a substance time is not

9920.439 --> 9925.880000000001
a physics based thing there's something

9922.88 --> 9929.479
as passage of time what is the passage

9925.88 --> 9933.319
of time it's a standard entropy

9929.479 --> 9935.92
rate standard entropy rate of material

9933.319 --> 9938.399
and substances yeah that's the real

9935.92 --> 9941.399
thing entropy is the real thing time

9938.399 --> 9945.439
doesn't exist it's a

9941.399 --> 9949.08
concept you can work with time within

9945.439 --> 9954.319
math but in as as it comes to like

9949.08 --> 9954.319
physical reality it's it's not a

9956.279 --> 9961.800000000001
thing time is not a substance and

9959.0 --> 9965.92
SpaceTime and SpaceTime bending is

9961.8 --> 9969.08
complete nonsensical science fiction

9965.92 --> 9969.92
that's routed in math and then reified

9969.08 --> 9972.6
by

9969.92 --> 9978.279
Einstein and everybody that follows that

9972.6 --> 9978.279
into physics which is pseudo science

9983.72 --> 9989.119999999999
you feel awful today oh well that's too

9985.6 --> 9989.12
bad Gary f

10016.04 --> 10021.240000000002
it's like TV dinner brownie depending on

10019.68 --> 10024.0
how much time in the microwave could be

10021.24 --> 10027.359
a rock or a laugh that is hilarious

10024.0 --> 10030.08
comparison aty but I mean that's not

10027.359 --> 10030.08
even a bad

10030.439 --> 10037.2
comparison like that that is actually

10034.76 --> 10040.800000000001
quite a decent thing to compare that

10037.2 --> 10043.92
process with yeah if at least to make it

10040.8 --> 10043.92
comprehensible to

10050.72 --> 10055.64
people entropy and the movement of

10053.08 --> 10055.64
celestial

10056.88 --> 10062.438999999998
bodies well the movement of celestial

10059.2 --> 10064.16
bodies doesn't really I mean that's just

10062.439 --> 10066.76
an apparent thing like the movement of

10064.16 --> 10069.68
celestial bodies doesn't do anything

10066.76 --> 10072.64
it's the effect like entropy just points

10069.68 --> 10074.6
at like there is a consistency with the

10072.64 --> 10076.96
movement of celestial bodies that

10074.6 --> 10081.24
doesn't make the celestial bodies time

10076.96 --> 10084.599999999999
they by the way reafi that in that

10081.24 --> 10086.68
video they do that they get quite

10084.6 --> 10089.24
ridiculous at the point where they say

10086.68 --> 10093.12
oh space is time and time is space like

10089.24 --> 10095.72
it becomes really insane basically start

10093.12 --> 10098.0
rambling like some weirdo cultist at

10095.72 --> 10100.72
that point I mean not exaggerating and

10098.0 --> 10102.8
I'm not even saying like oh how dare

10100.72 --> 10105.679999999998
they that's so stupid it's so evil no

10102.8 --> 10109.119999999999
it's like it's a moment of provable

10105.68 --> 10112.479000000001
delusion it's where they lose focus stop

10109.12 --> 10113.52
being a nerd and start suddenly raving

10112.479 --> 10117.119999999999
like a

10113.52 --> 10119.960000000001
cultist and it's a Pity that they do

10117.12 --> 10122.399000000001
that doesn't take away from the

10119.96 --> 10124.56
Magnificent discovery of this

10122.399 --> 10127.039999999999
engineering development

10124.56 --> 10131.08
though but they do kind of ramble like

10127.04 --> 10131.080000000002
cultists in that for a

10139.319 --> 10142.319
bit

10150.56 --> 10156.64
what the [ __ ] is that supposed to mean

10153.12 --> 10156.640000000001
Buck Wester hello duper

10157.72 --> 10163.519999999999
boons missing the point I don't even

10160.359 --> 10163.52
know what the hell this point

10172.479 --> 10177.358999999999
is that's right time is not a tangible

10175.2 --> 10179.880000000001
thing it's not a thing that you very

10177.359 --> 10182.880000000001
manipulate it's not naturally occurring

10179.88 --> 10185.64
phenomenon you can't very manipulate it

10182.88 --> 10189.199999999999
and it doesn't do

10185.64 --> 10192.72
anything it's a derived

10189.2 --> 10194.12
concept kind of like Mass oh how dare

10192.72 --> 10197.599999999999
you how dare

10194.12 --> 10200.2
you yeah it's not a thing density is a

10197.6 --> 10203.800000000001
thing Mass not a thing it's a derived

10200.2 --> 10206.239000000001
concept time not a thing a derived

10203.8 --> 10209.039999999999
concept can't fairy manipulate is not a

10206.239 --> 10209.039999999999
naturally occurring

10212.8 --> 10220.399
phenomenon no duun it does not entropy

10217.0 --> 10220.399
causes aging

10238.239 --> 10246.239
bending of spey is what is debatable no

10241.279 --> 10249.08
it's not debatable it's total

10246.239 --> 10252.84
nonsense pseudo scientific

10249.08 --> 10255.68
mathematically derived nonsense that is

10252.84 --> 10255.68
what that is

10261.64 --> 10268.278999999999
boxb there's nothing to debate about

10264.72 --> 10268.278999999999
literally nothing

10306.96 --> 10312.519999999999
right I take two minutes break and I

10310.279 --> 10313.960000000001
could keep this going this is good to

10312.52 --> 10317.479000000001
have a discussion

10313.96 --> 10317.479
here be right

10337.52 --> 10340.52
back

10367.439 --> 10370.439
e

10397.439 --> 10401.479000000001
e e

10450.52 --> 10457.04
will the talk with Mikey happen uh I

10454.0 --> 10459.479
don't know he contacted me on on uh on

10457.04 --> 10461.76
my email and in the comment section I

10459.479 --> 10464.519999999999
told him to contact me on Skype he

10461.76 --> 10467.72
hasn't done that thus

10464.52 --> 10469.720000000001
far cuz I'm definitely not going to just

10467.72 --> 10472.16
like oh yeah get over here and when he

10469.72 --> 10475.679999999998
doesn't go on Skype because that's how

10472.16 --> 10479.399
we're going to do the show

10475.68 --> 10482.479000000001
anyway so yeah I'll just wait until I he

10479.399 --> 10487.16
gets back to me

10482.479 --> 10487.16
duper oh plunder 23

10493.359 --> 10497.84
depending space the existence of

10495.72 --> 10501.358999999999
SpaceTime is a simple

10497.84 --> 10503.0
concept oh yeah really it's a simple

10501.359 --> 10507.359
concept that

10503.0 --> 10510.399
exists uh so it it isn't a concept is it

10507.359 --> 10512.6
a concept or is it something that

10510.399 --> 10516.239
exists why don't you make up your mind

10512.6 --> 10516.239
box out buster

10521.6 --> 10528.52
because from what I heard like that's

10525.64 --> 10532.56
just just a

10528.52 --> 10535.52
concept not a thing it's just a model

10532.56 --> 10539.08
it's a model of arranging

10535.52 --> 10540.800000000001
information that gives you better

10539.08 --> 10544.52
oversight

10540.8 --> 10547.358999999999
perhaps yeah well it's a model it's not

10544.52 --> 10548.880000000001
a actual thing it's just a way to

10547.359 --> 10551.12
arrange

10548.88 --> 10555.119999999999
certain

10551.12 --> 10556.84
information where passage of time is a

10555.12 --> 10562.92
part of

10556.84 --> 10567.319
it yeah data Arrangement a model not a

10562.92 --> 10569.76
thing not a substance not a cause of an

10567.319 --> 10573.68
effect not a naturally occurring

10569.76 --> 10577.319
phenomenon not physics just the concept

10573.68 --> 10581.52
usable concept you can model with it not

10577.319 --> 10581.519999999999
a palpable thing within physics

10584.08 --> 10591.479
though right description just like math

10587.92 --> 10595.56
yeah and math isn't physics

10591.479 --> 10595.56
either so yeah that's

10596.88 --> 10600.278999999999
cute not a

10600.88 --> 10607.239
thing it's not an element not the cause

10604.239 --> 10610.92
of an effect not a naturally occurring

10607.239 --> 10612.8
phenomenon it's just a model exactly

10610.92 --> 10619.279
like what I

10612.8 --> 10619.278999999999
said pointless not proof of anything

10628.76 --> 10631.889000000001
[Music]

10644.56 --> 10651.92
a way to describe something yes

10647.52 --> 10651.92
so not a thing

10677.12 --> 10682.68
right you could say A Spacetime diagram

10680.64 --> 10685.199999999999
is just a

10682.68 --> 10690.16
schematic

10685.2 --> 10691.239000000001
of a process that where over time there

10690.16 --> 10693.76
are

10691.239 --> 10697.199999999999
changes those changes are consistent

10693.76 --> 10700.279
over time and then you can map those

10697.2 --> 10703.16
changes over time in a

10700.279 --> 10704.880000000001
schematic in a diagram that's what

10703.16 --> 10711.119999999999
they've done and they call it A

10704.88 --> 10711.119999999999
Spacetime diagram but that is very

10711.88 --> 10717.599999999999
confusing but it's basically just the

10714.6 --> 10722.439
way they name it within an

10717.6 --> 10724.640000000001
engineering thing like that's a man-made

10722.439 --> 10728.84
Engineering

10724.64 --> 10732.16
Process that they then catalog

10728.84 --> 10737.2
and map the results of it and then put

10732.16 --> 10737.2
those results line them up in a

10746.359 --> 10750.960000000001
diagram you don't have to repeat

10748.52 --> 10755.279
yourself box out Buster especially with

10750.96 --> 10755.278999999999
exclamation marks in there

10758.359 --> 10765.2
how do I know all this I pick up on it

10761.8 --> 10768.319
and understand it duper from the Dark

10765.2 --> 10768.319000000001
World the [ __ ]

10772.12 --> 10777.6
Frank what kind of remark is that

10826.88 --> 10833.88
H that's an interesting question Frank

10830.16 --> 10837.439
is common sense actually

10833.88 --> 10843.0
common it's a good question is common

10837.439 --> 10843.0
sense still common or is common sense

10843.16 --> 10851.279
rare that might be an interesting title

10845.6 --> 10851.279
for another show is com sense rare

10857.8 --> 10864.16
now right psychological warfare and the

10861.479 --> 10869.16
entropy of

10864.16 --> 10869.16
sensibility is common sense rare

10870.72 --> 10875.358999999999
now all right but I'll leave that for

10873.04 --> 10875.359
another

10876.399 --> 10883.278999999999
show ooh Sun

10880.279 --> 10887.6
yay

10883.279 --> 10887.6
woohoo check it out Blue

10893.76 --> 10899.2
Sky that's where you got my I don't know

10896.88 --> 10901.96
why you thought that Frank like where

10899.2 --> 10905.800000000001
are you getting this

10901.96 --> 10909.8
from what what's your source for that

10905.8 --> 10909.8
thought Frank

10924.279 --> 10929.08
I mean you keep bringing [ __ ] Dark

10926.52 --> 10934.52
World up I I don't even bring it

10929.08 --> 10934.52
up you keep doing that why

10950.08 --> 10954.72
is that Mikey I don't know if that is

10952.16 --> 10956.92
Mikey box sidebuster I have no idea who

10954.72 --> 10956.92
he

10958.96 --> 10965.479
is I am the source I said something

10961.68 --> 10968.84
along those lines oh well yeah who

10965.479 --> 10968.84
[ __ ] cares

10971.319 --> 10974.6
yes they are the same guy

10991.08 --> 10997.8
LSG so got any

10993.6 --> 10999.720000000001
more stupid remarks Frank CU I'm at the

10997.8 --> 11002.399
point of just kicking you

10999.72 --> 11004.64
out you're being like a

11002.399 --> 11008.68
nuisance being disruptive you're

11004.64 --> 11010.08
bringing in sidetracking that detract

11008.68 --> 11014.2
from

11010.08 --> 11016.12
the the nature of the entire subject and

11014.2 --> 11019.16
I don't understand why you would do that

11016.12 --> 11022.160000000002
other than to just disrupt my activity

11019.16 --> 11022.16
here

11026.72 --> 11030.76
Frank e

11068.72 --> 11075.8
mention dark this one time yeah

11072.96 --> 11080.08
why why would you do that what the hell

11075.8 --> 11080.08
is the point of bringing that up

11095.92 --> 11104.64
yeah tell me why why did you bring it up

11100.64 --> 11104.64
what is the point of that

11125.239 --> 11127.399
come

11138.359 --> 11145.12
on because I talked about it uh yeah no

11142.319 --> 11148.56
I didn't I didn't talk about it you

11145.12 --> 11148.560000000001
brought it up

11155.88 --> 11162.479
and I don't give a [ __ ] slow mode is

11158.56 --> 11164.16
killing you yeah maybe just have more

11162.479 --> 11167.239
content to your

11164.16 --> 11170.119999999999
comments maybe just actually be honest

11167.239 --> 11172.92
and just tell me why you brought it up

11170.12 --> 11175.52
huh because I don't bring it

11172.92 --> 11178.04
up I haven't brought it up in like half

11175.52 --> 11182.92
a year

11178.04 --> 11185.92
yeah I only even say the word because

11182.92 --> 11189.88
trolls bring it up

11185.92 --> 11192.0
huh CU it's not relevant to anything

11189.88 --> 11195.16
especially not to the subject we're

11192.0 --> 11198.76
talking about right now the subject of

11195.16 --> 11201.039999999999
today's show has absolutely no relevance

11198.76 --> 11201.04
to

11205.6 --> 11209.52
that yeah

11223.08 --> 11228.239
oh there's a n oh yeah yeah of course

11225.359 --> 11232.239
not going to be on topic oh

11228.239 --> 11232.239
yeah sure

11238.479 --> 11244.08
well maybe duper pun wasn't asking you

11241.04 --> 11244.080000000002
have you ever considered

11252.479 --> 11258.84
that and how the hell would you even

11254.88 --> 11262.88
know that that that the dark world is

11258.84 --> 11265.04
that like you just made it up you just

11262.88 --> 11266.599999999999
inserted something made it up answered

11265.04 --> 11269.439
somebody else's question that they

11266.6 --> 11269.439
weren't asking

11275.96 --> 11281.438999999998
you yeah I don't give a [ __ ] extra

11278.52 --> 11283.640000000001
pixels if I see you complain one more

11281.439 --> 11288.2
[ __ ] time about the slow mode I will

11283.64 --> 11288.199999999999
ban you do you hear

11294.88 --> 11300.88
me just do it one more time dude and

11298.279 --> 11300.880000000001
you're out of

11311.79 --> 11315.909000000001
[Music]

11323.479 --> 11328.438999999998
here yeah he did na G because he's a

11326.359 --> 11331.08
[ __ ] troll I know know he is a Troll

11328.439 --> 11333.68
he's a [ __ ] troll infiltrator and he

11331.08 --> 11339.239
just wants to be a [ __ ] piece of

11333.68 --> 11342.239
[ __ ] that's why you're banned

11339.239 --> 11342.239
now

11354.2 --> 11359.359
bye-bye trust me you won't be missed

11368.12 --> 11370.76
yeah it was a

11371.359 --> 11379.16
complaint and you're

11374.68 --> 11382.6
gone anybody else hey Gary

11379.16 --> 11385.279
F you got you got something you want to

11382.6 --> 11388.52
get kicked out too cuz you guys will not

11385.279 --> 11388.52
be missed

11392.399 --> 11396.399
yeah will not be missing

11409.359 --> 11416.2
you be perfectly perfectly content with

11414.2 --> 11418.560000000001
having the first half hour of my show

11416.2 --> 11421.399000000001
just be completely silent with nobody

11418.56 --> 11425.479
saying anything because wrenches usually

11421.399 --> 11425.479
come in like after half an hour or an

11425.56 --> 11431.278999999999
hour and I'll have absolutely no problem

11458.76 --> 11464.880000000001
no we're not talking about the dark

11461.52 --> 11467.319000000001
arts and I'm not going to and anybody

11464.88 --> 11470.039999999999
asks yeah you're not part of me you're

11467.319 --> 11470.039999999999
not part of this

11470.52 --> 11473.52
chat

11473.88 --> 11479.278999999999
yeah because dark arts

11477.76 --> 11481.84
I don't want to have anything to do with

11479.279 --> 11484.279
that

11481.84 --> 11485.64
see and if you're interested in that I

11484.279 --> 11488.640000000001
don't want to have anything to do with

11485.64 --> 11488.64
you

11524.88 --> 11529.839999999998
all right like Gary is being

11530.52 --> 11534.0
wise good on

11534.319 --> 11538.319
you yeah

11544.47 --> 11552.358999999999
[Music]

11547.439 --> 11552.359
cuz I'm done with all this attitude

11561.88 --> 11569.119999999999
[ __ ]

11563.68 --> 11569.12
interruped okay couldn't discuss the GR

11569.279 --> 11572.6
night okay

11572.64 --> 11580.8
whatever you leave your comments as you

11575.319 --> 11580.8
always do stone monkey that's just fine

11601.02 --> 11609.08
[Music]

11603.6 --> 11609.08
okay let see yeah yeah I mean maybe

11630.08 --> 11632.6
hey Zep

11633.479 --> 11636.88
Tey welcome

11656.04 --> 11660.080000000002
back for

11682.1 --> 11685.239
[Music]

11688.88 --> 11693.679999999998
people are not ready to undo and relearn

11694.0 --> 11700.399
probably you actually unbanned me wow do

11697.88 --> 11703.319
you come over

11700.399 --> 11705.358999999999
regularly and say something just to see

11703.319 --> 11706.92
if you happen to have been unbanned does

11705.359 --> 11710.0
that happen all the time do you people

11706.92 --> 11714.399
do that all the time oh quickly let's go

11710.0 --> 11718.399
to Arn's life chat and see if I'm

11714.399 --> 11718.399
banned what

11725.239 --> 11732.72
but yeah yeah I did choose to unban you

11728.96 --> 11734.358999999999
recently and a couple of other people

11732.72 --> 11737.679999999998
from past

11734.359 --> 11739.56
situations that I think like might get

11737.68 --> 11743.16
another

11739.56 --> 11747.319
chance I mean I've changed a

11743.16 --> 11750.199
lot have a new perspective

11747.319 --> 11754.239
on dealing with people and I'm willing

11750.199 --> 11754.239000000001
to give a whole bunch of people a new

11754.96 --> 11759.399
chance not regularly once in a while you

11757.439 --> 11763.0
do that

11759.399 --> 11763.0
okay all right

11763.72 --> 11769.039999999999
SE anyway welcome back

11806.08 --> 11811.199
what do we think but fossil fuel being

11808.239 --> 11814.52
fied you think they are really bad for

11811.199 --> 11816.640000000001
the environment

11814.52 --> 11820.12
no no not at

11816.64 --> 11822.319
all first off that the term fossil fuel

11820.12 --> 11824.92
is

11822.319 --> 11826.64
ridiculous like absolutely ridic it's

11824.92 --> 11832.76
not fossil

11826.64 --> 11832.76
fuel there's no evidence that any fossil

11832.84 --> 11839.960000000001
or old life buried in the ground has any

11837.56 --> 11843.399
relation to oil

11839.96 --> 11846.399
whatsoever like at

11843.399 --> 11846.399
all

11847.0 --> 11853.04
like the closest relation to what you

11849.88 --> 11856.72
would could think of as like fossil type

11853.04 --> 11859.12
fuel would be

11856.72 --> 11863.358999999999
Pete that's how you call I don't how do

11859.12 --> 11863.359
you call that hold on

11870.95 --> 11875.640000000001
[Music]

11872.68 --> 11880.08
yeah p p e a

11875.64 --> 11884.88
t because that's like what's left in a

11880.08 --> 11887.199
swamp and then and bugs and you can dry

11884.88 --> 11889.119999999999
that out and then actually use it as

11887.199 --> 11893.439
burning

11889.12 --> 11894.92
fuel that's the closest to fossil fuels

11893.439 --> 11897.68
that actually

11894.92 --> 11900.04
exists and I mean there is also like

11897.68 --> 11902.439
swamp gas but I mean that that's all

11900.04 --> 11905.439
tied into that but it's it's just plants

11902.439 --> 11907.6
and it's not that old it's not ancient

11905.439 --> 11909.359
it's definitely not

11907.6 --> 11912.399000000001
fossilized

11909.359 --> 11917.239
ridiculous right so Pete could be

11912.399 --> 11920.319
considered fossil fuel uh oil that's

11917.239 --> 11923.88
abiotic it's it's bacteria that under

11920.319 --> 11926.84
high pressure transform

11923.88 --> 11929.64
consume Rock

11926.84 --> 11932.960000000001
and minerals and then just create the

11929.64 --> 11935.519999999999
black goo out of it that we know as raw

11932.96 --> 11937.839999999998
oil and it

11935.52 --> 11940.239
replenishes it has nothing to do with

11937.84 --> 11944.12
fossils at

11940.239 --> 11947.8
all H natural gas is probably a similar

11944.12 --> 11953.04
process it's bacteria that

11947.8 --> 11955.72
just eat away at stuff and keep reacting

11953.04 --> 11959.319000000001
and reacting and it just keeps creating

11955.72 --> 11961.16
that methane pressure and other

11959.319 --> 11964.68
chemicals by the way there's some toxins

11961.16 --> 11969.76
in there that get filtered out of

11964.68 --> 11974.52
it yeah fossils have nothing to do with

11969.76 --> 11977.92
it as far as to say it's bad for the

11974.52 --> 11981.84
environment well the refinement

11977.92 --> 11985.439
processes processes concerning oil to

11981.84 --> 11988.16
make it into fuel yeah there are some

11985.439 --> 11990.76
chemical wastes

11988.16 --> 11994.0
that are a bit of an

11990.76 --> 11997.68
issue but I mean the end result is just

11994.0 --> 12000.239
very well worth it the overall pollution

11997.68 --> 12002.399
is really not that bad and hey it's a

12000.239 --> 12005.68
replenishable resource it doesn't

12002.399 --> 12010.88
actually run out oil wells refill

12005.68 --> 12010.880000000001
themselves over time when they turn

12011.08 --> 12015.08
depleted so

12023.16 --> 12029.039999999999
like natural gas is like one of the most

12026.92 --> 12030.960000000001
environmentally friendly

12029.04 --> 12034.160000000002
forms

12030.96 --> 12037.278999999999
of energy production there is it is

12034.16 --> 12040.6
literally like the

12037.279 --> 12043.399000000001
cleanest big quantity

12040.6 --> 12046.16
resource that is out there that you can

12043.399 --> 12047.479
find it's the most environmentally

12046.16 --> 12049.72
friendly

12047.479 --> 12054.08
way to have

12049.72 --> 12056.479
fuel and oil yeah it has I mean you have

12054.08 --> 12059.0
to refine it there's chemicals get get

12056.479 --> 12062.599999999999
involved and eventually you build up

12059.0 --> 12065.56
polluting chemicals but I mean it's

12062.6 --> 12067.479000000001
still very well worth it and who knows

12065.56 --> 12070.399
maybe with some

12067.479 --> 12073.72
transmutation you could actually get rid

12070.399 --> 12076.68
of those build up chemical

12073.72 --> 12077.438999999998
pollution build up chemical refineries

12076.68 --> 12079.56
side

12077.439 --> 12083.04
substances could potentially deal with

12079.56 --> 12085.6
it instead of just stacking them up

12083.04 --> 12089.640000000001
somewhere which is what has been

12085.6 --> 12093.08
done I mean for over a 100

12089.64 --> 12096.599999999999
years it's just

12093.08 --> 12099.439
places giant basement giant holes in the

12096.6 --> 12101.0
ground where just huge stacks of

12099.439 --> 12103.12
chemical

12101.0 --> 12105.72
waste in

12103.12 --> 12107.92
buckets in drums and they're just stored

12105.72 --> 12110.08
there and

12107.92 --> 12111.92
with hopes that it doesn't get damage

12110.08 --> 12113.92
because then it would just leak into the

12111.92 --> 12118.279
environment and being extremely

12113.92 --> 12120.479
polluting right so with oil refining

12118.279 --> 12124.0
yeah there is

12120.479 --> 12126.438999999998
some natural yeah

12124.0 --> 12129.439
pollution build

12126.439 --> 12132.279
up but that doesn't make it oh we should

12129.439 --> 12133.960000000001
avoided at all cost No Nonsense you know

12132.279 --> 12137.08
what is really polluting what is

12133.96 --> 12138.198999999999
actually polluting not having put proper

12137.08 --> 12141.84
energy

12138.199 --> 12145.359
available yeah having to destroy nature

12141.84 --> 12147.76
to install a bunch of environmentally

12145.359 --> 12151.239
clean energy sources which is complete

12147.76 --> 12154.12
[ __ ] and actually is more energy

12151.239 --> 12156.6
consuming and less delivering than just

12154.12 --> 12156.6
using

12161.12 --> 12167.279
oil and yeah the same goes for nuclear

12163.84 --> 12169.64
nuclear is very efficient

12167.279 --> 12173.279
and not

12169.64 --> 12178.16
polluting could also very easily be used

12173.279 --> 12180.04
but I mean even the oil that just works

12178.16 --> 12184.319
fine right

12180.04 --> 12187.160000000002
and it can be developed even further

12184.319 --> 12190.16
come even less polluting more

12187.16 --> 12193.279
efficient keeps developing I mean engine

12190.16 --> 12196.6
technology has come a very far away very

12193.279 --> 12196.6
long way

12205.12 --> 12210.960000000001
no duper stars are not ball

12208.6 --> 12213.960000000001
lightning how do you come up with that

12210.96 --> 12213.96
[ __ ]

12234.92 --> 12240.12
Supply oil really yeah really have any

12238.199 --> 12241.720000000001
laws bending the combustion engine we

12240.12 --> 12243.640000000001
could Advance the efficiency of the

12241.72 --> 12245.64
diesel engine to above

12243.64 --> 12248.64
90%

12245.64 --> 12248.64
yes

12254.0 --> 12261.16
absolutely right and and the point is is

12256.92 --> 12266.960000000001
you can store diesel for a very long

12261.16 --> 12271.52
time and use it in a very decentralized

12266.96 --> 12275.08
way so you could like keep it in a in a

12271.52 --> 12277.880000000001
in a tank with an engine and just like

12275.08 --> 12280.039999999999
have it sit somewhere for 50

12277.88 --> 12281.64
years and then it's like oh we need to

12280.04 --> 12284.359
use it right now all of a sudden and

12281.64 --> 12286.8
then you just use it and it works like

12284.359 --> 12287.720000000001
that's enormous efficiency it didn't

12286.8 --> 12291.0
have

12287.72 --> 12293.239
any influence on the environment it

12291.0 --> 12296.72
didn't consume anything while you didn't

12293.239 --> 12301.0
use it it's just a great way to

12296.72 --> 12301.0
decentralize energy storage

12317.16 --> 12322.16
yes box out Buster yeah that's what Pete

12319.56 --> 12322.16
is I

12331.84 --> 12339.16
know that's why I brought it up

12335.8 --> 12340.88
earlier the point is is that Pete is the

12339.16 --> 12344.359
closest

12340.88 --> 12347.8
to fossil fuels which is what they name

12344.359 --> 12351.479000000001
all these resources it's the closest to

12347.8 --> 12351.479
actually being true to that

12353.199 --> 12359.479000000001
name because they claim with fossil

12355.88 --> 12360.88
fuels it's all decayed organic material

12359.479 --> 12363.92
that's that's the

12360.88 --> 12366.72
claim with fossil

12363.92 --> 12372.52
fuels and Pete is the only thing that's

12366.72 --> 12372.519999999999
actually provably that decaying organic

12375.239 --> 12379.279
material for

12431.64 --> 12434.439
all right anyway I'm going to round out

12433.16 --> 12437.399
the show

12434.439 --> 12440.52
soon I hope you all eny enjoyed it I

12437.399 --> 12443.88
mean I I did and it's been a very

12440.52 --> 12446.04
interesting subject that will be brought

12443.88 --> 12448.119999999999
back up I'm pretty sure it's going to be

12446.04 --> 12450.52
more talked about

12448.12 --> 12452.52
it and I'm going to watch some more

12450.52 --> 12454.880000000001
videos about it as well maybe there's

12452.52 --> 12457.84
some other details that I hadn't figured

12454.88 --> 12461.239
out yet from just this first

12457.84 --> 12464.479
watch but I think that I have actually

12461.239 --> 12467.96
covered a lot of relevant points that

12464.479 --> 12470.88
pertain to this ball lightning plasmoid

12467.96 --> 12470.88
transmutation

12475.04 --> 12481.92
process yeah doons again has absolutely

12479.6 --> 12483.800000000001
nothing to do with the subject

12481.92 --> 12485.76
whatsoever so I'm not even going to

12483.8 --> 12489.84
address

12485.76 --> 12489.84
that you always keep doing

12489.88 --> 12494.438999999998
that I'm just not going to answer that

12492.08 --> 12496.68
anymore yeah every time you just bring

12494.439 --> 12499.6
