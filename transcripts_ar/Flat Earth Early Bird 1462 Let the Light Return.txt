7.59 --> 37.469
[Music]

95.96 --> 100.939

99.54 --> 104.52000000000001

131.28 --> 135.8
this point

132.84 --> 135.8
it's been a while

135.9 --> 141.8
right

137.459 --> 141.8
but anyway Merry Christmas

141.87 --> 145.739
[Music]

143.58 --> 149.42000000000002
ah the weather today unfortunately is

145.739 --> 149.42000000000002
kind of shitty over here

149.94 --> 155.34
but uh yeah I mean I don't have to go

153.239 --> 158.72
outside at all

155.34 --> 158.72
everything's closed anyway

158.819 --> 163.33999999999997
so it's a really stay indoors kind of

161.22 --> 163.34
day

167.7 --> 171.61999999999998
somebody letting their dog out in the

169.5 --> 171.62
rain

172.379 --> 175.16
hmm

176.22 --> 181.14
people heading over to their families

179.459 --> 185.0
for Christmas

181.14 --> 185.0
dinner and all that probably

200.099 --> 210.5
hello c m c g first in chat

206.12 --> 210.5
uh Clary let's see you

211.14 --> 214.14
foreign

215.48 --> 220.14
is not what it used to be since Flat

218.4 --> 224.4
Earth

220.14 --> 227.599
well not yeah not if your siblings and

224.4 --> 227.59900000000002
parents and all that

228.78 --> 233.94
if that yeah if they don't like it yeah

231.54 --> 235.85999999999999
but I mean you could say the same thing

233.94 --> 238.34
for like 9 11.

235.86 --> 238.34
right

240.84 --> 245.4
but yeah being an ignorant little kid

243.42 --> 247.44
tends to be

245.4 --> 250.4
a little bit more exciting during

247.44 --> 250.4
Christmas of course

250.439 --> 254.04
because yeah the tensions are typically

252.42 --> 257.15999999999997
running High

254.04 --> 260.03999999999996
which isn't just because of the coming

257.16 --> 262.199
together event or it's that secondary

260.04 --> 264.97900000000004
it's usually big well because it's the

262.199 --> 264.979
time of the year

266.28 --> 272.09999999999997
it's a time where it's the darkest and

269.04 --> 273.3
then tensions Run High like instincts

272.1 --> 278.04
are

273.3 --> 280.919
basically making calls to change mode

278.04 --> 282.18
but then it changes

280.919 --> 285.06
because then

282.18 --> 287.66
they scroll longer again right the light

285.06 --> 287.66
returns

290.4 --> 293.96
so if you just keep that in mind

294.24 --> 301.139
then yeah I mean I don't get into

298.16 --> 302.06
confrontational situations at all during

301.139 --> 305.699
Christmas

302.06 --> 308.699
it's really only like when my parents

305.699 --> 311.28000000000003
tell me like yeah

308.699 --> 313.139
give me all you got right like show me

311.28 --> 316.73999999999995
how good you know what's on your mind

313.139 --> 319.02
and then I might like start like because

316.74 --> 321.36
yeah I'm still under that energy

319.02 --> 324.539
I mean it happened last Christmas too it

321.36 --> 327.6
tends to happen like one time but

324.539 --> 329.9
I basically preface it like uh are you

327.6 --> 329.90000000000003
sure

332.88 --> 337.139
because I am intense and they know

335.52 --> 339.9
and I don't

337.139 --> 343.74
like I'm very careful just not to

339.9 --> 346.5
overwhelm them and like ruin

343.74 --> 349.1
a sense of calm

346.5 --> 349.1
anyway

350.34 --> 356.23999999999995
because of words are little kids hey

353.1 --> 356.24
hello clutch Merry Christmas

358.7 --> 367.59
[Music]

365.3 --> 371.01
what I'm looking forward to it

367.59 --> 371.01
[Music]

373.11 --> 378.24
[Music]

375.539 --> 380.52
tomorrow that is it's not I don't have

378.24 --> 381.90000000000003
Christmas dinner today as far as I know

380.52 --> 384.919
no

381.9 --> 384.919
it's gonna be a Monday

395.819 --> 401.46000000000004
straight into Adidas correlates with

397.919 --> 403.99
blue sauces no it's not strange at all

401.46 --> 405.71999999999997
because it's been grafted together

403.99 --> 407.28000000000003
[Music]

405.72 --> 410.96000000000004
let's see

407.28 --> 410.96
uh you've got it

412.44 --> 417.12
it's a hybridized story

415.319 --> 419.03900000000004
right

417.12 --> 421.979
because yeah because of the timing and

419.039 --> 425.78
all that it is

421.979 --> 425.78
solstice celebration

427.86 --> 435.18
but that has been graphed together with

432.0 --> 436.5
well with Jesus as a figure into that

435.18 --> 439.979
story

436.5 --> 441.84
that specific story about his birth

439.979 --> 445.25899999999996
and

441.84 --> 450.11999999999995
his Death Rising three days later I mean

445.259 --> 454.58000000000004
that component about the story is

450.12 --> 454.58
is based on celestial events

455.039 --> 458.94
in the sense as to how it's been

457.319 --> 461.22
arranged

458.94 --> 464.16
in the story that doesn't mean that none

461.22 --> 466.22
of that anything like that happen it's

464.16 --> 469.259
just that it's been re

466.22 --> 471.59900000000005
-constructed into that format for

469.259 --> 473.639
presentation right I mean I've been

471.599 --> 475.86
saying it for quite a while I've strong

473.639 --> 478.199
conviction

475.86 --> 481.68
that the Bible has been like a

478.199 --> 483.539
theatrical Recreation of Jesus who in my

481.68 --> 486.919
opinion

483.539 --> 486.919
it was a real man

487.44 --> 491.0
the best of us anyway

495.199 --> 499.5
can't accept and I see in the

497.52 --> 500.87
Christianity

499.5 --> 508.45
no me neither

500.87 --> 508.45
[Music]

509.52 --> 512.3
foreign

514.919 --> 518.18
Jesus's words

519.0 --> 524.82
anyway

521.25 --> 526.86
[Music]

524.82 --> 528.839
it's gonna be a bit of a grinding

526.86 --> 531.839
straighten it all out

528.839 --> 536.22
for a while I mean

531.839 --> 540.6
Christianity is like at yeah at our

536.22 --> 542.6600000000001
cultural foundations in the west a lot

540.6 --> 545.339
but it's just been

542.66 --> 548.24
dilapidated and corrupted in ways

545.339 --> 548.24
culturally

549.3 --> 555.019
and so everybody has issues with it one

552.42 --> 555.019
way or the other

556.08 --> 562.38
I have issues with

558.42 --> 564.0
how they use chants that make no logical

562.38 --> 567.6
sense

564.0 --> 569.399
and then stare blindly at it in euphoria

567.6 --> 571.26
believing that because they don't

569.399 --> 573.56
understand it's some greater mystical

571.26 --> 573.56
thing

575.899 --> 579.98
well it's just a puzzle

582.779 --> 588.779
and like it it's it shouldn't like

586.14 --> 591.24
there's probably like esoteric value a

588.779 --> 592.26
lot to like the Trinity concept and all

591.24 --> 594.24
that

592.26 --> 599.519
but

594.24 --> 602.519
it's all been too literalized it's like

599.519 --> 604.019
such talk was never really meant for the

602.519 --> 606.42
common Folk

604.019 --> 608.519
for people that aren't like really

606.42 --> 609.42
dedicated to spiritual things and all

608.519 --> 612.66
that

609.42 --> 616.279
so they just literalize it and then keep

612.66 --> 616.279
chanting that like it means something

618.42 --> 622.16
that's what I think about it

623.16 --> 628.26
yeah well that's the thing about it

625.56 --> 630.3
because of the literalization and like

628.26 --> 632.1
the inconsistency in their opinion

630.3 --> 634.1999999999999
everybody now

632.1 --> 635.88
then immediately grabs hold off the

634.2 --> 638.88
concept of infinity is like oh yeah but

635.88 --> 642.12
this is the real trick this is because

638.88 --> 644.459
Trinity is like a mind Arrangement it's

642.12 --> 647.399
a very three points

644.459 --> 649.29
and a lot of things are

647.399 --> 652.26
like divided in three

649.29 --> 655.3199999999999
[Music]

652.26 --> 657.36
so like when you apply Trinity to

655.32 --> 659.9590000000001
spiritual Dynamics things get really

657.36 --> 659.9590000000001
interesting

661.62 --> 665.18
but

662.82 --> 665.1800000000001
yeah

666.3 --> 672.92
it has very little to do with like the

669.06 --> 672.92
foundation of Jesus's work

673.44 --> 676.44
foreign

687.019 --> 694.079
you could say that the Trinity might

689.76 --> 694.079
have more connection with

694.38 --> 699.6
God himself

697.2 --> 702.12
the interactions

699.6 --> 704.7
that we have in our mind and through the

702.12 --> 708.62
spirit and the like the Holy Spirit to

704.7 --> 708.62
me it definitely is a thing

708.839 --> 713.48
right but what is that thing

715.74 --> 721.44
and not like oh what is it secretly evil

718.86 --> 724.019
no no no no it's like no but what is it

721.44 --> 725.7
actually right because it's like yeah we

724.019 --> 727.14
named it and oh this is that of course

725.7 --> 730.88
but

727.14 --> 730.88
but seriously what is that

732.18 --> 738.079
how does this work how can we just like

735.3 --> 738.079
communicate

738.3 --> 745.38
and then still get return signals

742.74 --> 749.66
from something that

745.38 --> 749.66
that it leads to us isn't us

752.519 --> 759.36
right it's pretty remarkable so yeah of

755.76 --> 762.36
course Trinity very fascinating

759.36 --> 764.399
spiritually but it has so little to do

762.36 --> 765.54
with actually

764.399 --> 768.72
like

765.54 --> 773.24
who is Jesus and like Jesus is the god

768.72 --> 773.24
and he's a man and he's a spirit like no

773.579 --> 778.019
like that doesn't mean

775.68 --> 782.2399999999999
what people probably will typically

778.019 --> 782.24
stumble upon in their conclusions

782.46 --> 786.48
[Music]

784.62 --> 789.42
it's like the high esoteric thing and

786.48 --> 793.019
it's not to be taken literal

789.42 --> 795.899
that's how I see it anyway

793.019 --> 798.779
hope I'm not like oh causing divided

795.899 --> 801.66
Visionaries ruining Christmas Arwin is

798.779 --> 803.88
ruining Christmas why did you have to do

801.66 --> 807.0
it Arwin

803.88 --> 809.779
I'm sorry I'm just trying to clarify it

807.0 --> 809.779
I mean

810.42 --> 816.3299999999999
that's what I do

812.55 --> 816.3299999999999
[Music]

819.3 --> 823.8
right I'm not even like

821.399 --> 825.6
okay you're really into the Trinity and

823.8 --> 830.04
you really think that Jesus and all that

825.6 --> 832.5
is like okay fine you think that cool

830.04 --> 835.38
I have problems with that

832.5 --> 837.12
because of well yeah explanation I've

835.38 --> 838.32
given

837.12 --> 840.36
and

838.32 --> 844.019
yeah I mean

840.36 --> 846.66
if that means because I don't comply to

844.019 --> 849.36
your chant

846.66 --> 853.139
your decision about it that you're gonna

849.36 --> 855.66
see me as going to hell or being sick

853.139 --> 859.5
with the evil or something

855.66 --> 863.579
then that is really the problem

859.5 --> 864.899
it's your response to your own

863.579 --> 867.5999999999999
chat

864.899 --> 870.839
not the chat

867.6 --> 873.3000000000001
because if I'd say nothing

870.839 --> 875.82
you you wouldn't have that response so

873.3 --> 878.579
there's this this thing that makes you

875.82 --> 880.6800000000001
put people in the pit now that's a

878.579 --> 882.3
problem that that behavior is the

880.68 --> 884.0999999999999
problem

882.3 --> 888.5999999999999
you're using your religion as a

884.1 --> 891.5
scapegoat to get to Unleash Your demon

888.6 --> 891.5
to act out

894.09 --> 898.86
[Music]

895.38 --> 902.04
right and that's not the way

898.86 --> 905.4590000000001
that's not a very Jesus would not agree

902.04 --> 908.639
to that methodology very specifically

905.459 --> 910.5
you should know that as a Christian

908.639 --> 912.48
right

910.5 --> 914.339
now of course there are just Christians

912.48 --> 917.76
out there that are like

914.339 --> 919.6800000000001
that would never be caught like

917.76 --> 922.1
acting out like that they're very

919.68 --> 922.0999999999999
careful

922.26 --> 926.639
but yeah I mean those Christians tend to

924.72 --> 928.8000000000001
be kind of hard to spot because they're

926.639 --> 932.54
just so modest and keep to themselves

928.8 --> 932.54
and they're not very expressive

933.24 --> 940.0790000000001
and I think that well the dad

937.92 --> 941.16
my ex-girlfriend that called me

940.079 --> 944.2199999999999
yesterday

941.16 --> 947.16
is like one of those types because he

944.22 --> 950.519
was a Christian I think

947.16 --> 953.579
I mean it very much seemed so everything

950.519 --> 955.44
that was said the way like what I loved

953.579 --> 958.279
so much but sorry I'm going back to that

955.44 --> 961.8000000000001
again it was just that

958.279 --> 964.199
they had like a power

961.8 --> 968.3389999999999
a power of like

964.199 --> 972.24
real family discipline like old way but

968.339 --> 975.5400000000001
but very sensible and focused like

972.24 --> 979.98
taking the family honor like really

975.54 --> 983.2199999999999
serious and in a good way

979.98 --> 985.6800000000001
very Christian and but I did I didn't

983.22 --> 987.839
come from a family like that right at

985.68 --> 990.0
all I mean we were like liberal you

987.839 --> 993.24
could do whatever you want except like

990.0 --> 996.24
don't get too annoying and don't keep

993.24 --> 997.91
ramming through things because that just

996.24 --> 999.24
gets on everybody's nerves

997.91 --> 1001.279
[Music]

999.24 --> 1003.5
but like everybody would just say

1001.279 --> 1005.0
whatever no matter how crazy it could

1003.5 --> 1008.779
get sometimes

1005.0 --> 1011.42
and like this family was not like that

1008.779 --> 1013.82
at all and I was like whoa

1011.42 --> 1015.56
because I did go over I I was like

1013.82 --> 1018.5
trying to be very respectful and

1015.56 --> 1021.38
honorable because I mean

1018.5 --> 1023.54
yeah I really respected that girl I

1021.38 --> 1027.199
really loved her

1023.54 --> 1029.959
and probably still do in a way

1027.199 --> 1032.72
but so I was like yeah I have to present

1029.959 --> 1035.48
but I didn't know like whoa what is this

1032.72 --> 1038.1200000000001
and now looking back like

1035.48 --> 1040.4
what is it

1038.12 --> 1042.62
more than 20 years later

1040.4 --> 1046.16
I'm like whoa

1042.62 --> 1048.319
that is what that was

1046.16 --> 1051.14
that's actually in a way what I'm

1048.319 --> 1053.1789999999999
looking for what they had

1051.14 --> 1055.3400000000001
that's what I'm trying to build towards

1053.179 --> 1057.799
because I don't want to have that same

1055.34 --> 1058.6399999999999
system if I ever get involved in a

1057.799 --> 1060.9189999999999
family

1058.64 --> 1063.14
like where I came from because that

1060.919 --> 1067.039
liberalness

1063.14 --> 1069.14
it definitely like matured my mind very

1067.039 --> 1071.0
early in a way in a sense that I just

1069.14 --> 1073.64
got to dig everywhere and then touch

1071.0 --> 1076.4
everywhere and then have like kind of a

1073.64 --> 1078.7990000000002
head start in a way but it also spread a

1076.4 --> 1081.5800000000002
lot of chaos made me disconjuncted

1078.799 --> 1081.58
socially

1085.34 --> 1092.299
and that's why I'm now kind of a loner

1089.12 --> 1095.9599999999998
because of that so I don't know

1092.299 --> 1098.36
yeah I just think about things

1095.96 --> 1102.22
anyway back yeah

1098.36 --> 1102.2199999999998
what you were talking about clearly

1108.14 --> 1115.24
Jesus not the Old Testament God because

1111.799 --> 1119.24
of eternal spirit right well that's

1115.24 --> 1119.24
debatable clearly

1119.72 --> 1122.72
foreign

1125.72 --> 1128.72
like

1133.1 --> 1138.9189999999999
your father is not my father might be

1135.74 --> 1143.059
paraphrasing right

1138.919 --> 1145.64
and and I get that but did he mean that

1143.059 --> 1149.539
like absolutely literally or is it just

1145.64 --> 1153.3200000000002
like no your interpretation

1149.539 --> 1155.98
is very far straight off how my

1153.32 --> 1155.98
interpretation

1159.44 --> 1165.74
it's like would Jesus yeah but this is

1162.62 --> 1169.78
like weird questions right I mean

1165.74 --> 1169.78
but I do wonder sometimes like

1171.14 --> 1176.3600000000001
What would

1172.46 --> 1178.76
why would Jesus opinion be about the Old

1176.36 --> 1180.74
Testament

1178.76 --> 1184.58
and like

1180.74 --> 1186.919
did he have like an idea like no those I

1184.58 --> 1189.26
think those guys like acted incorrectly

1186.919 --> 1192.7990000000002
and and this is just showing like what

1189.26 --> 1193.94
happens when you stray

1192.799 --> 1197.799
right

1193.94 --> 1197.799
hey LSG let's see you

1200.84 --> 1205.6999999999998
or did he really think like no that's

1203.179 --> 1207.5590000000002
basically the devil because that would

1205.7 --> 1210.74
be the conclusion if it's like oh but

1207.559 --> 1211.58
that's not my god well there is only one

1210.74 --> 1214.58
God

1211.58 --> 1218.84
so that would mean it's the devil

1214.58 --> 1222.4399999999998
then right so did he really think that

1218.84 --> 1225.559
was he like uh High Old Testament guys

1222.44 --> 1226.88
you're actually following the devil

1225.559 --> 1229.84
or

1226.88 --> 1233.48
is it like no you completely

1229.84 --> 1236.0
misinterpreted God's glory and even

1233.48 --> 1238.28
though it was right

1236.0 --> 1240.58
the way you did it is actually totally

1238.28 --> 1240.58
wrong

1243.559 --> 1250.6
right which one is it it's very like

1247.6 --> 1252.34
earth-shattering difference

1250.6 --> 1256.36
[Music]

1252.34 --> 1256.36
so which one is it

1256.76 --> 1259.96
what do you think Cleary

1263.65 --> 1266.699
[Music]

1271.95 --> 1274.989
[Music]

1293.36 --> 1299.6589999999999
right man and when you get into when you

1296.419 --> 1304.3400000000001
like put a complete esoteric view to it

1299.659 --> 1306.5590000000002
and like leave out the the god mechanics

1304.34 --> 1307.9399999999998
then it gets even weirder because then

1306.559 --> 1311.059
it's like okay

1307.94 --> 1314.539
so was Christ then following this Holy

1311.059 --> 1317.32
Spirit energy that is clearly there it's

1314.539 --> 1317.32
like always there

1317.48 --> 1322.46
and there's like rules to it I mean you

1320.24 --> 1324.6200000000001
can basically lose your sensitivity to

1322.46 --> 1326.8400000000001
interact with it and then you're cut off

1324.62 --> 1329.84
if you did too many sins and darkness

1326.84 --> 1332.8999999999999
and [ __ ] and then just works differently

1329.84 --> 1335.8999999999999
and then it doesn't work the same

1332.9 --> 1338.7800000000002
anymore but at the same time

1335.9 --> 1343.52
then the old

1338.78 --> 1346.94
like well basically molec type God that

1343.52 --> 1349.039
style of like using sacrifice and death

1346.94 --> 1352.46
and suffering

1349.039 --> 1355.299
as like a Earthly or like a spirit for

1352.46 --> 1355.299
Earthly game

1355.46 --> 1360.88
the darkness the other Spirit side

1360.919 --> 1366.7
right you could interpret it on an

1363.14 --> 1366.7
esoteric level like that too

1372.5 --> 1379.42
foreign

1375.19 --> 1379.42
[Music]

1391.36 --> 1395.6
but look

1393.679 --> 1398.539
having a problem with factions of

1395.6 --> 1400.58
Judaism is not rare I mean Jews

1398.539 --> 1403.36
throughout history have had problems

1400.58 --> 1407.78
with other factions of Jews a lot so

1403.36 --> 1407.78
that's not really

1408.5 --> 1416.02
hitting the nail on the head

1411.46 --> 1416.02
concerning well that big question

1423.02 --> 1428.9189999999999
but hey if you just don't know

1425.96 --> 1428.919
that's okay

1429.44 --> 1432.679
I don't know either I'm not sure about

1431.6 --> 1435.08
it

1432.679 --> 1437.0
I've had some leads and these are my

1435.08 --> 1439.28
conclusions

1437.0 --> 1442.039
thus far

1439.28 --> 1443.6589999999999
energy right anyway

1442.039 --> 1445.58
uh

1443.659 --> 1447.2600000000002
Chad is filling up cool

1445.58 --> 1449.059
so yeah there's this

1447.26 --> 1452.96
[Music]

1449.059 --> 1454.46
Pig show with own Benjamin that I was

1452.96 --> 1456.14
watching is part of the reason why I was

1454.46 --> 1458.74
a little late too because I just kept

1456.14 --> 1458.74
watching that

1459.2 --> 1465.26
Eva and the Bear

1461.539 --> 1470.32
man I mean that's like Shiva and Shiva

1465.26 --> 1470.32
is freaking brilliant I mean

1471.08 --> 1476.12
I feel like a pretender clown compared

1473.539 --> 1479.6
to that guy when it comes to actual

1476.12 --> 1482.84
intelligence that guy knows so much it's

1479.6 --> 1485.84
crazy and he has such like heavy

1482.84 --> 1487.3999999999999
condensed spirit it's like whoa

1485.84 --> 1489.86
so check it out

1487.4 --> 1492.8600000000001
probably already know him and look this

1489.86 --> 1495.32
guy is like really going for it in ways

1492.86 --> 1498.559
and he's facing everything

1495.32 --> 1501.1
it's really remarkable and Owen Benjamin

1498.559 --> 1504.6399999999999
and him have this conversation it's

1501.1 --> 1504.6399999999999
really good

1505.58 --> 1510.58
it's very impressive

1507.559 --> 1510.58
so check it out

1511.159 --> 1516.2600000000002
like and it's

1512.659 --> 1518.659
it doesn't get gross

1516.26 --> 1521.9
they keep it neat

1518.659 --> 1525.2
it's really good

1521.9 --> 1526.88
I mean this is so good it's almost like

1525.2 --> 1530.779
shareable

1526.88 --> 1533.419
with family but I would yeah maybe not

1530.779 --> 1536.539
during Christmas dinner because then I

1533.419 --> 1537.6200000000001
mean it it does reveal some hurt you

1536.539 --> 1539.539
might want to check it out yourself

1537.62 --> 1541.6589999999999
before you share it with anyone of

1539.539 --> 1541.6589999999999
course

1541.72 --> 1546.48
it's really good show so the link is in

1544.88 --> 1547.8200000000002
the chat

1546.48 --> 1550.34
[Music]

1547.82 --> 1553.96
be sure to check it out after my show I

1550.34 --> 1557.62
will continue watching it after my show

1553.96 --> 1557.6200000000001
was halfway

1559.49 --> 1562.69
[Music]

1563.419 --> 1565.779
right

1567.83 --> 1571.07
[Music]

1574.7 --> 1579.46
anyway Claire if you if you got any

1576.559 --> 1579.46
follow-up on that

1581.96 --> 1588.5
if you want to move on that's fine too

1584.72 --> 1592.64
it's just that yeah I thought that was a

1588.5 --> 1595.7
a Worthy a worthy question to put down

1592.64 --> 1597.98
for people to think about like how what

1595.7 --> 1600.44
is really going on with Jesus

1597.98 --> 1604.7
I mean he was a spiritual revolutionary

1600.44 --> 1607.159
that is for sure profit

1604.7 --> 1609.8600000000001
right and he did really change things

1607.159 --> 1612.64
like whether that was truly meant or not

1609.86 --> 1612.6399999999999
he did

1612.919 --> 1616.8200000000002
yeah

1614.0 --> 1619.58
that's for sure right the prophecy is

1616.82 --> 1622.34
kind of secondary to me in in my opinion

1619.58 --> 1625.52
towards like the actual provable effect

1622.34 --> 1628.1589999999999
that his teachings have

1625.52 --> 1629.36
and have had on the way people have

1628.159 --> 1632.419
thought

1629.36 --> 1634.8999999999999
over all that time that has passed since

1632.419 --> 1634.9
so

1635.419 --> 1642.74
did he think

1638.0 --> 1645.44
that the Old Testament God was not the

1642.74 --> 1648.22
real God because I mean pretty sure he's

1645.44 --> 1648.22
a monotheist

1649.159 --> 1655.64
there's only one God the true God right

1652.46 --> 1659.659
so did he basically denounce that like

1655.64 --> 1663.679
no no that wasn't that's not my father

1659.659 --> 1666.679
right but does he then mean like no wait

1663.679 --> 1669.38
that's literally the wrong God you're

1666.679 --> 1670.88
worshiping the devil which has vast

1669.38 --> 1674.7990000000002
implications

1670.88 --> 1674.7990000000002
because then basically who would

1674.84 --> 1680.4189999999999
it's complicated right or

1678.86 --> 1683.6789999999999
no

1680.419 --> 1687.8600000000001
you're interpreting it the wrong way

1683.679 --> 1690.6200000000001
you've been misled it was God but you

1687.86 --> 1692.299
went astray and we all got to see and

1690.62 --> 1694.8799999999999
learn about the results of that it's

1692.299 --> 1697.94
just that nobody gets it I get it

1694.88 --> 1699.679
because I'm Jesus and I figured it out

1697.94 --> 1701.539
I'm here to bring

1699.679 --> 1703.779
you two Enlightenment and the way

1701.539 --> 1703.779
through

1706.039 --> 1710.98
right

1707.36 --> 1715.9599999999998
so of course didn't literally say that

1710.98 --> 1715.96
but I'm trying to yeah anyway

1716.799 --> 1721.48
and to bring the kingdom of God

1724.32 --> 1727.52
[Music]

1728.24 --> 1733.22
right

1729.44 --> 1735.6200000000001
well that's also esoteric I mean

1733.22 --> 1739.279
I'm pretty sure he didn't literally like

1735.62 --> 1740.9599999999998
oh bloop here's a giant Kingdom it's of

1739.279 --> 1744.799
God it's literally no

1740.96 --> 1747.74
mint like oh follow the way

1744.799 --> 1752.08
follow my teachings and you will find

1747.74 --> 1752.08
that entry to the kingdom of God

1753.02 --> 1755.9189999999999
am I right

1773.36 --> 1776.1399999999999
exactly

1783.44 --> 1788.72
foreign so I'm very curious to find out

1787.58 --> 1792.3799999999999
more

1788.72 --> 1795.02
details maybe like side works even I

1792.38 --> 1795.919
mean there's pieces left out of the

1795.02 --> 1797.899
Bible

1795.919 --> 1801.3200000000002
and just to figure out

1797.899 --> 1804.58
if people have figured out like

1801.32 --> 1804.58
what did he really mean

1805.76 --> 1809.84
do you literally think that the Old

1807.799 --> 1814.179
Testament God

1809.84 --> 1814.1789999999999
was not God but the devil

1814.48 --> 1822.559
or did he think it was God and well

1819.26 --> 1824.48
it's like the the predecessors didn't

1822.559 --> 1828.08
have the right tools yet to respond

1824.48 --> 1830.72
correctly and so it manifested like that

1828.08 --> 1833.059
because on an esoteric level me

1830.72 --> 1835.88
personally through my experiences and

1833.059 --> 1837.74
interactions and studied a lot like

1835.88 --> 1840.44
spiritually on my own it's not something

1837.74 --> 1843.6200000000001
that's come from books

1840.44 --> 1849.1000000000001
it's like however you act

1843.62 --> 1849.1
is how God will interact with you

1850.22 --> 1856.3600000000001
and that's also why I believe that

1852.62 --> 1858.799
technically I like the devil really is

1856.36 --> 1862.399
God's servant

1858.799 --> 1864.62
and so if you then like overstep with

1862.399 --> 1867.86
sins and like double down on it like

1864.62 --> 1871.1
integrate that with your spirit then

1867.86 --> 1874.1
you get assigned to the master of those

1871.1 --> 1876.559
frequencies and then you get to face the

1874.1 --> 1878.899
devil basically

1876.559 --> 1882.9189999999999
but that's all like in agreement with

1878.899 --> 1884.6589999999999
God I mean it's his worker

1882.919 --> 1887.779
even though they are like

1884.659 --> 1890.779
philosophically and emotionally probably

1887.779 --> 1893.74
like or the devil at least I don't know

1890.779 --> 1893.74
I don't know man

1894.86 --> 1899.1789999999999
can do they even have like feelings

1896.899 --> 1901.82
towards one another or is that just like

1899.179 --> 1903.919
what happens when people interact with

1901.82 --> 1906.08
them and then face the counter opposite

1903.919 --> 1909.0200000000002
influence

1906.08 --> 1911.9189999999999
do they really like as

1909.02 --> 1911.9189999999999
entities

1912.26 --> 1919.64
even care about one another at all

1915.98 --> 1921.74
I'm I'd be inclined to say like no and I

1919.64 --> 1924.14
could even say like maybe the devil is

1921.74 --> 1926.779
simply God putting on that mask because

1924.14 --> 1929.539
he has to it's like his discipline mask

1926.779 --> 1933.5
it's like you've been a bad boy so Here

1929.539 --> 1935.76
Comes The Devil right I mean I kind of

1933.5 --> 1938.809
view it like that

1935.76 --> 1938.809
[Music]

1948.98 --> 1952.84
thank you

1950.85 --> 1956.4189999999999
[Music]

1952.84 --> 1960.1999999999998
it's very basic really to think about it

1956.419 --> 1963.14
like that but it is it does work like

1960.2 --> 1965.8400000000001
that and I've been all over the place

1963.14 --> 1971.44
with my spirit

1965.84 --> 1971.4399999999998
I've avoided like catastrophic sin

1971.96 --> 1977.179
but I definitely like gazed upon that

1975.32 --> 1980.48
sort of [ __ ]

1977.179 --> 1983.48
and went through moral hazards and even

1980.48 --> 1984.98
like deluded myself at times because I

1983.48 --> 1988.52
literally couldn't handle what was

1984.98 --> 1989.32
happening and that would kind of lead me

1988.52 --> 1991.8799999999999
to

1989.32 --> 1994.8799999999999
become faced with the devil more

1991.88 --> 1997.0390000000002
effectively

1994.88 --> 1999.15
because of my weakness

1997.039 --> 2000.76
my weakness towards evil

1999.15 --> 2002.38
[Music]

2000.76 --> 2006.22
it's very

2002.38 --> 2008.2
personal really but I absolutely climbed

2006.22 --> 2010.3600000000001
out of that because

2008.2 --> 2012.159
and here yeah I

2010.36 --> 2015.899
I did

2012.159 --> 2015.8990000000001
go in there with a mission

2016.899 --> 2023.4399999999998
I needed to understand it I literally

2019.96 --> 2025.6000000000001
did not understand evil at all like it

2023.44 --> 2027.46
was like a myth to me

2025.6 --> 2029.6789999999999
I would see that sort of thing in

2027.46 --> 2032.38
television but to me it was just nothing

2029.679 --> 2034.48
more than like oh it's so scary but it's

2032.38 --> 2035.74
nothing is real really

2034.48 --> 2037.8990000000001
that's

2035.74 --> 2040.36
how yeah

2037.899 --> 2042.58
never had any actual horror or anything

2040.36 --> 2045.519
in the family

2042.58 --> 2047.73
mean bad situations maybe but not like

2045.519 --> 2050.379
really terrible things

2047.73 --> 2053.879
[Music]

2050.379 --> 2053.879
no actual violence

2054.46 --> 2059.44
or anything like that so I just didn't

2056.919 --> 2061.6589999999997
understand it at all

2059.44 --> 2064.3
and I kind of like was like yeah but I'm

2061.659 --> 2066.339
young and I I want to be a warrior I

2064.3 --> 2067.54
want to be a wizard and I want to be

2066.339 --> 2069.58
everything

2067.54 --> 2071.919
and then it's like yeah there's nothing

2069.58 --> 2074.44
out there for you to

2071.919 --> 2077.5
to go on that path so that it's like

2074.44 --> 2079.78
okay then I have to like dig in the dark

2077.5 --> 2083.74
I have to risk it I have to figure out

2079.78 --> 2086.2000000000003
what this is and I did and oh my God

2083.74 --> 2090.1189999999997
oh my God

2086.2 --> 2092.74
I mean shaking with regret

2090.119 --> 2094.2400000000002
when I found out some of these things

2092.74 --> 2096.7799999999997
shaking

2094.24 --> 2096.7799999999997
like

2108.04 --> 2116.44
right and was all then that was yeah

2113.14 --> 2120.16
but I'm thankful I'm thankful that I got

2116.44 --> 2122.92
that horror over me I I'm not that that

2120.16 --> 2126.16
[ __ ] happened but that I felt it that I

2122.92 --> 2128.079
felt how terrible it was that it was I'm

2126.16 --> 2129.7599999999998
kind of lucky that I was able to control

2128.079 --> 2132.099
it when it was happening that it didn't

2129.76 --> 2133.8390000000004
just go insane or something

2132.099 --> 2135.579
because that would have ended very badly

2133.839 --> 2137.5
for me I'm sure because when you break

2135.579 --> 2140.1400000000003
then that's when they immediately latch

2137.5 --> 2144.0
out and start trying to program you

2140.14 --> 2144.0
seen it happen to other people

2146.619 --> 2154.3
so I prevented that at all costs

2149.8 --> 2157.2400000000002
but then afterward it the gates open up

2154.3 --> 2159.48
and then you get to face it holy [ __ ]

2157.24 --> 2159.4799999999996
man

2159.52 --> 2162.42
nightmares

2164.32 --> 2169.9
so I got up close to see what it is and

2167.32 --> 2172.9
my conclusions

2169.9 --> 2175.599
is that well evil is a mistake it

2172.9 --> 2178.78
literally is like a persistent mistake

2175.599 --> 2181.3
usually when it becomes really evil

2178.78 --> 2182.98
evil upon evil it's mistake upon the

2181.3 --> 2185.7400000000002
mistake of my own mistake it's the same

2182.98 --> 2188.32
pattern it's the same thing really it's

2185.74 --> 2191.5
just that it's personal that's why we

2188.32 --> 2194.46
distinguish between evil and somebody

2191.5 --> 2194.46
making a mistake

2196.24 --> 2200.02
since weird dichotomy that's very

2198.16 --> 2201.839
personal it's in everybody

2200.02 --> 2204.94
[Music]

2201.839 --> 2208.42
so I found out all these things about my

2204.94 --> 2211.48
own psyche about how thankful I am for

2208.42 --> 2214.54
the impulses that warned me that that

2211.48 --> 2216.88
were designed in my body by God and my

2214.54 --> 2220.859
spirit never rejected them

2216.88 --> 2220.859
I never rejected the punishment

2221.02 --> 2226.3
like the truthful punishment in myself I

2224.619 --> 2228.46
mean there has nothing to do with like

2226.3 --> 2230.619
other people putting punishment on me

2228.46 --> 2233.82
has to do with me

2230.619 --> 2233.82
feeling what's real

2234.4 --> 2238.119
and when something terrible is happening

2236.38 --> 2239.6800000000003
that it doesn't matter what you have in

2238.119 --> 2242.1400000000003
your head

2239.68 --> 2245.52
that you will feel that it is terrible

2242.14 --> 2245.52
no matter what you think

2248.8 --> 2251.4
foreign

2257.2 --> 2263.7599999999998
hello Taffy 46

2260.5 --> 2263.76
telling friends and family

2265.72 --> 2270.7
I've got lost a couple of friends yeah

2267.82 --> 2273.42

2270.7 --> 2273.4199999999996
this month

2282.099 --> 2285.94
thank you

2283.92 --> 2290.2000000000003
[Music]

2285.94 --> 2293.14
gotta run for a minute okay Cleary

2290.2 --> 2295.7999999999997
maybe you should just like spend some

2293.14 --> 2295.7999999999997
time with your kids

2297.94 --> 2301.92
soak it up man I mean

2302.14 --> 2308.2799999999997
they don't stay young forever

2305.859 --> 2308.2799999999997
like that

2310.27 --> 2318.88
[Music]

2316.839 --> 2320.98
right anyway I hope you guys are all

2318.88 --> 2322.7200000000003
enjoying the show I might have been yeah

2320.98 --> 2325.0
I know it might have like rolled a

2322.72 --> 2328.1189999999997
little bit into the darkness

2325.0 --> 2332.38
I had that last night too

2328.119 --> 2336.28
I actually watched some really creepy

2332.38 --> 2337.54
but good creepy but still very far

2336.28 --> 2340.32
creepy

2337.54 --> 2340.32
like a

2340.66 --> 2347.2
a thriller horror mini Siri thing but

2344.32 --> 2350.44
not slasher style at all it's not about

2347.2 --> 2353.3799999999997
that at all so like Mr mystical and

2350.44 --> 2355.9
creepy and occult

2353.38 --> 2358.3
fascinating stuff on Netflix I bumped

2355.9 --> 2361.7200000000003
into it and I watched it and was like oh

2358.3 --> 2367.44
Jesus this is like dude it's hilarious

2361.72 --> 2367.4399999999996
and really scary I mean dude

2369.52 --> 2374.339
every episode of that series is

2375.64 --> 2379.2999999999997
you gotta be careful with your family

2377.44 --> 2382.359
because you're gonna figure out if they

2379.3 --> 2384.76
have phobias when you just watch this

2382.359 --> 2387.22
because every episode is like a pinnacle

2384.76 --> 2389.7400000000002
of some kind of a phobia and it's really

2387.22 --> 2392.4399999999996
intense I mean dude

2389.74 --> 2397.1189999999997
I was genuinely scared and that's not

2392.44 --> 2401.16
jump scare by the way zero that is a

2397.119 --> 2404.28
quality series but it's it's really

2401.16 --> 2407.7999999999997
dude they have like the creepiest ass

2404.28 --> 2410.8
Grappler characters ever I mean

2407.8 --> 2410.8
bro

2411.22 --> 2416.9199999999996
don't watch this if you're like unstable

2414.22 --> 2418.66
or anything make sure you don't do that

2416.92 --> 2421.78
but

2418.66 --> 2425.46
see what's it called

2421.78 --> 2425.46
Cabinet of Curiosities

2427.54 --> 2433.7799999999997
it's yes classified horror definitely it

2431.079 --> 2436.96
is it's it's a bit

2433.78 --> 2440.44
to the level of cthulian it's a bit

2436.96 --> 2442.599
almost there but not fully

2440.44 --> 2445.7200000000003
it's very Broad

2442.599 --> 2447.94
and very I don't know it's creepy as

2445.72 --> 2450.8199999999997
[ __ ] though so if you want like a really

2447.94 --> 2455.079
scary ass series that's actually

2450.82 --> 2457.6600000000003
actually really scary watch that cabinet

2455.079 --> 2460.119
of Horrors on Netflix discovered it

2457.66 --> 2463.2999999999997
yesterday watch three episodes and every

2460.119 --> 2465.76
single episode like scared the [ __ ] out

2463.3 --> 2469.5
of me separately they're all

2465.76 --> 2469.5
one episode stories

2471.82 --> 2475.6600000000003
be careful with that [ __ ] I actually

2474.339 --> 2478.0
want to watch those three episodes

2475.66 --> 2480.64
really late at night before going to bed

2478.0 --> 2482.24
and I still slept fine and I feel that

2480.64 --> 2485.5
that was kind of a miracle

2482.24 --> 2487.4799999999996
[Music]

2485.5 --> 2489.46
I feel kind of lucky because I should

2487.48 --> 2492.579
not have watched it that late but it was

2489.46 --> 2494.56
just so well done man it was and no the

2492.579 --> 2496.3590000000004
no jump scares

2494.56 --> 2499.74
but

2496.359 --> 2499.74
but fine as [ __ ]

2500.14 --> 2505.42
yeah

2502.26 --> 2508.119
I'm really curious if I'm gonna bump

2505.42 --> 2511.1800000000003
into certain things

2508.119 --> 2514.359
because this is like scary enough that

2511.18 --> 2516.339
maybe like in my Dark World Vision and

2514.359 --> 2518.44
to the Future they've used elements of

2516.339 --> 2520.48
this I've already recognized certain

2518.44 --> 2522.94
traits

2520.48 --> 2525.4
and when I say they use I'm talking

2522.94 --> 2527.98
about the demons that were constructing

2525.4 --> 2530.02
the vision for me

2527.98 --> 2532.38
because I'm pretty sure that that's what

2530.02 --> 2532.38
they were

2534.82 --> 2539.32
thank you

2536.26 --> 2541.7200000000003
or at least at times that's

2539.32 --> 2544.119
I had a strong indication of that maybe

2541.72 --> 2545.859
I think that at some point even during

2544.119 --> 2548.8
the vision that the actual original

2545.859 --> 2551.98
demons that initiated it that they left

2548.8 --> 2553.2400000000002
or they were banished

2551.98 --> 2556.06
because

2553.24 --> 2557.2599999999998
like the really scary [ __ ] was mostly at

2556.06 --> 2559.18
the first part

2557.26 --> 2561.5200000000004
of the vision

2559.18 --> 2563.8799999999997
or like the first half it was a lot of

2561.52 --> 2563.88
Horror

2564.16 --> 2570.16
it's like 80 years

2567.4 --> 2572.079
way too much way too compact

2570.16 --> 2574.839
like like

2572.079 --> 2577.6600000000003
it's probably wasn't literally 80 years

2574.839 --> 2580.14
but the way it was compacted it's like

2577.66 --> 2580.14
it was

2582.04 --> 2587.74
like on computer files how they encrypt

2584.56 --> 2589.839
or like compact it right well that's

2587.74 --> 2592.24
kind of like what that Vision was to me

2589.839 --> 2594.7
it was like a lot of information

2592.24 --> 2597.52
really compacted but it was way too

2594.7 --> 2600.04
intense it was nerve-wracking it was

2597.52 --> 2601.599
Nightmare literally and I don't know why

2600.04 --> 2604.66
that [ __ ]

2601.599 --> 2607.119
I ever agreed to do that

2604.66 --> 2609.16
it was just sort of like an ambition or

2607.119 --> 2613.98
something

2609.16 --> 2613.98
I wanted to figure it out that yeah

2614.2 --> 2620.74
let's get weird because that specific

2617.68 --> 2623.3799999999997
type experience that compacting that was

2620.74 --> 2626.6189999999997
like a sub Dark World experience that

2623.38 --> 2629.579
was like because yeah dude

2626.619 --> 2632.319
I told everybody how basically the whole

2629.579 --> 2635.44
sort of happened because of

2632.319 --> 2638.38
drugs I was fed

2635.44 --> 2641.5
one time one time that I'm certain that

2638.38 --> 2643.359
it actually happened but in the freaking

2641.5 --> 2645.94
vision

2643.359 --> 2648.7599999999998
it happened too like

2645.94 --> 2650.92
I basically been fed that [ __ ] maybe

2648.76 --> 2653.5600000000004
like 10 times

2650.92 --> 2655.7200000000003
but that wasn't in physical reality it

2653.56 --> 2659.02
was in division

2655.72 --> 2660.5789999999997
and that would create a sub vision

2659.02 --> 2663.599
ah

2660.579 --> 2663.599
so weird

2666.339 --> 2671.5
maybe you like taking that stuff kind of

2669.099 --> 2673.1800000000003
symbolized that my pineal gland would

2671.5 --> 2677.4
just squirt or something

2673.18 --> 2677.3999999999996
during the dream I don't know what it is

2677.68 --> 2682.98
so it's been very mysterious to me

2680.2 --> 2682.98
but uh

2685.119 --> 2689.619
it's a little much maybe it's a roll out

2687.339 --> 2692.5789999999997
all of a sudden uh

2689.619 --> 2692.579
hey Stevie Traveler

2695.859 --> 2699.9
what do I say what

2697.3 --> 2699.9
they talking about

2703.0 --> 2707.98
can you go into how the Visions were

2705.22 --> 2709.8999999999996
constructed dreams well it's like a

2707.98 --> 2713.579
holographic construction it's it's a

2709.9 --> 2713.579
like a lucid dream that's been

2714.359 --> 2718.68
like taking control over

2719.74 --> 2725.16
but like in a really far stage of

2722.859 --> 2725.16
control

2733.74 --> 2740.859
right so my conclusion that Visions are

2738.099 --> 2742.96
constructed is because I just paid so

2740.859 --> 2746.44
much attention I didn't just focus on

2742.96 --> 2750.78
trying to suspend myself into that state

2746.44 --> 2750.78
to interface with the hologram

2751.18 --> 2754.14
because yeah

2754.3 --> 2758.6800000000003
I mean we're talking about Spirit like

2756.88 --> 2762.76
the literal spirit

2758.68 --> 2766.2
not the body in the physical world

2762.76 --> 2766.2000000000003
things happen there man

2767.319 --> 2773.319
like ideas in there can literally be

2770.56 --> 2775.7799999999997
like created into like a holographic

2773.319 --> 2777.579
construct like a sphere or something

2775.78 --> 2779.7400000000002
that has the dream

2777.579 --> 2782.079
and then if you tap into it you

2779.74 --> 2784.5
literally experience it like you're

2782.079 --> 2784.5
living it

2788.079 --> 2793.78
right gives a whole new context to

2790.359 --> 2796.72
looking into the glass sphere fortune

2793.78 --> 2798.6400000000003
telling yeah well in the Dark World

2796.72 --> 2801.0989999999997
like that's sort of like

2798.64 --> 2804.04
was there too except

2801.099 --> 2806.44
it wasn't just like ooh make believe no

2804.04 --> 2808.599
it's actually like no it's a sphere it's

2806.44 --> 2811.119
literally an idea manifest and then you

2808.599 --> 2813.2200000000003
tap into it and that's beep you get the

2811.119 --> 2815.94
experience like

2813.22 --> 2815.9399999999996
well

2819.62 --> 2824.52
[Music]

2821.98 --> 2824.52
right

2829.72 --> 2834.2799999999997
but yeah even these descriptions of what

2832.42 --> 2836.079
I'm telling you now about this fear and

2834.28 --> 2838.2400000000002
of ideas and all that and how that was

2836.079 --> 2840.819
working to me I mean

2838.24 --> 2843.72
you do have to realize that that in

2840.819 --> 2845.98
itself was the way that my mind

2843.72 --> 2848.68
constructed it all

2845.98 --> 2851.02
because other people can probably have

2848.68 --> 2853.72
completely different setups of their

2851.02 --> 2855.579
Dark World experience

2853.72 --> 2858.16
right

2855.579 --> 2860.44
because their mind constructs the

2858.16 --> 2862.95
holographic experience differently

2860.44 --> 2864.88
because they are different

2862.95 --> 2867.2999999999997
[Music]

2864.88 --> 2867.3
right

2868.3 --> 2873.7000000000003
so

2870.78 --> 2875.7400000000002
there was basically a lot of like really

2873.7 --> 2878.4399999999996
good creativity

2875.74 --> 2880.359
in there in how things were represented

2878.44 --> 2882.099
it was all very efficient

2880.359 --> 2885.48
it's very quick

2882.099 --> 2885.48
to learn things there

2886.0 --> 2890.68
like it had more good mechanical

2888.52 --> 2892.9
potential for me to learn even though

2890.68 --> 2894.04
because I was scared during a lot of

2892.9 --> 2895.599
these experience because I don't know

2894.04 --> 2897.579
what the [ __ ] was going on when that

2895.599 --> 2901.1800000000003
happened

2897.579 --> 2903.1600000000003
then the fear made me unable to really

2901.18 --> 2906.96
learn those lessons

2903.16 --> 2906.96
as effectively as I could have

2908.619 --> 2913.96
but because it's also imprinted I have

2911.74 --> 2917.2
like a second look

2913.96 --> 2919.48
afterward now now I can look back on it

2917.2 --> 2921.7599999999998
just like as if it were a physical world

2919.48 --> 2923.02
experience right because as a kid you

2921.76 --> 2924.579
have a lot of physical world experience

2923.02 --> 2927.099
and at the time you don't understand

2924.579 --> 2928.599
what the [ __ ] going on you have all

2927.099 --> 2930.04
the superficial ideas that have been

2928.599 --> 2931.599
handed to you you constructed something

2930.04 --> 2933.64
with it in your mind and that's what you

2931.599 --> 2935.38
think reality is and then like 10 years

2933.64 --> 2937.0
later you realize holy [ __ ] this was

2935.38 --> 2939.4
going on that was going on oh my God

2937.0 --> 2941.8
that was that what that was

2939.4 --> 2943.839
right you can look back and then learn

2941.8 --> 2945.52
so much more about what was going on how

2943.839 --> 2947.98
you were mistaken well I can do that

2945.52 --> 2949.72
with my Dark World Visions I didn't get

2947.98 --> 2952.0
what the [ __ ] was going on when it

2949.72 --> 2954.0989999999997
happened for a big part especially

2952.0 --> 2956.68
because I was so scared didn't know what

2954.099 --> 2959.56
it even was that was happening

2956.68 --> 2961.8999999999996
but it's been all pretty imprinted and I

2959.56 --> 2964.14
can look back and now realize what that

2961.9 --> 2964.14
was

2966.52 --> 2971.579
anyway a little man like me what's that

2969.4 --> 2971.579
link

2978.94 --> 2981.48
what

2986.98 --> 2989.98
foreign

2998.98 --> 3001.579
anyway

3003.54 --> 3009.7799999999997
I mean if the pub really said that then

3007.079 --> 3013.3390000000004
he's clearly projecting I mean of course

3009.78 --> 3013.3390000000004
he's talking about himself

3014.819 --> 3017.839
isn't that obvious

3024.06 --> 3027.54
what's the number one thing that demons

3026.339 --> 3031.74
love to do

3027.54 --> 3035.25
project the [ __ ] out of everything

3031.74 --> 3038.5099999999998
entire reality if necessary

3035.25 --> 3038.51
[Music]

3039.119 --> 3041.6600000000003
anyway

3043.97 --> 3048.7099999999996
[Music]

3062.36 --> 3065.829
[Music]

3078.66 --> 3084.96
right so any feedback

3082.74 --> 3086.9399999999996
could you guys even follow what the hell

3084.96 --> 3089.28
I was talking about with all the vision

3086.94 --> 3091.94
stuff

3089.28 --> 3091.94
uh

3095.28 --> 3098.28
foreign

3119.99 --> 3123.2099999999996
[Music]

3126.359 --> 3133.14
by the way I've I've attained a like a

3130.079 --> 3136.319
weird but interesting view even on

3133.14 --> 3138.66
demons and when I'm saying demons I mean

3136.319 --> 3140.7599999999998
specifically in relation to

3138.66 --> 3143.0589999999997
visions

3140.76 --> 3145.44
because they were not like ooh spooky

3143.059 --> 3148.559
creatures or anything

3145.44 --> 3153.02
they were basically just people but they

3148.559 --> 3153.02
like typically had full black eyes

3153.599 --> 3157.819
that's how it represented itself

3160.2 --> 3164.04
apparently that's how I chose to

3162.3 --> 3165.48
represent them because of course it's

3164.04 --> 3168.839
still all the holographic construction

3165.48 --> 3170.88
but I mean entities there

3168.839 --> 3175.7599999999998
were real

3170.88 --> 3175.76
and constructs were really constructs

3176.579 --> 3180.599
like

3177.66 --> 3183.54
a lot of things I was creating there

3180.599 --> 3185.4
were like my constructs I mean

3183.54 --> 3188.54
technically the entire thing visually

3185.4 --> 3188.54
was my construct

3190.14 --> 3197.7
but there were things there

3193.319 --> 3197.7
that were not my will basically

3200.64 --> 3204.72
and yeah anyway

3205.859 --> 3213.319
um the thing is I think I figured out

3209.16 --> 3213.319
that basically demons are just

3214.02 --> 3221.22
like workers in ways like they're just

3218.28 --> 3223.5
there to do what they're supposed to do

3221.22 --> 3224.64
and like their ways they function and

3223.5 --> 3227.9
like they

3224.64 --> 3227.9
they feed off sin

3228.119 --> 3234.42
but yeah they only really overtake you

3230.88 --> 3238.44
and destroy you if you let them

3234.42 --> 3240.839
if you don't then they're more like dogs

3238.44 --> 3244.4
they're just like dogs and how well are

3240.839 --> 3244.4
you going to train your dog you know and

3246.599 --> 3252.54
but they yeah like

3249.18 --> 3256.14
I was very scared of them at first

3252.54 --> 3259.079
but then later stages especially after

3256.14 --> 3261.24
like the really scary parts were kind of

3259.079 --> 3263.3390000000004
over I still interacted

3261.24 --> 3265.5
with those constructs where they think

3263.339 --> 3267.72
are like my eternal demons or something

3265.5 --> 3270.3
I think that's probably where they're

3267.72 --> 3274.02
from there probably were like my demons

3270.3 --> 3276.599
when they say General saying people have

3274.02 --> 3279.599
their demons well I kind of literally

3276.599 --> 3282.3
experience that in a way I think

3279.599 --> 3284.94
through the Dark World Visions and I

3282.3 --> 3286.8
actually just like first was very scared

3284.94 --> 3289.98
of them and like rejected them I was

3286.8 --> 3291.599
like I'm against you I literally didn't

3289.98 --> 3293.579
understand what the [ __ ] was happening

3291.599 --> 3295.7400000000002
so I was just like thinking oh you're

3293.579 --> 3297.599
real demons I'm in another dimension but

3295.74 --> 3299.64
it's real and I didn't understand

3297.599 --> 3301.319
anything really what the [ __ ] was going

3299.64 --> 3303.42
on I didn't understand it was my

3301.319 --> 3304.859
construct I didn't understand I have all

3303.42 --> 3307.26
that power

3304.859 --> 3311.2799999999997
like in that experience

3307.26 --> 3313.2000000000003
or was afraid of it I was just afraid

3311.28 --> 3315.78
and now

3313.2 --> 3317.5789999999997
or later through the Dark World Visions

3315.78 --> 3319.3190000000004
I just started to figure out like wait

3317.579 --> 3321.559
no they're not coming after me they're

3319.319 --> 3321.5589999999997
not

3321.8 --> 3328.5
they just want things

3325.2 --> 3331.98
and they can do things

3328.5 --> 3333.66
and if you use them or give them what

3331.98 --> 3336.2400000000002
they want basically it's even about if

3333.66 --> 3337.859
you just give them what they want

3336.24 --> 3342.54
then

3337.859 --> 3344.5789999999997
they will yeah yeah try to get you

3342.54 --> 3346.68
hooked

3344.579 --> 3349.2000000000003
become very close friends but they're

3346.68 --> 3352.6189999999997
manipulative right and they basically

3349.2 --> 3355.5589999999997
just try to make you do things then

3352.619 --> 3359.2400000000002
but I yeah I didn't do that

3355.559 --> 3359.2400000000002
with them hey what's going on here

3366.0 --> 3368.839
and so

3368.94 --> 3374.28
they didn't turn out to be

3371.7 --> 3376.9199999999996
like they were kind of like respectful

3374.28 --> 3378.7200000000003
they were just like okay

3376.92 --> 3381.48
okay I guess that

3378.72 --> 3384.2599999999998
I guess you got it fixed then sort of

3381.48 --> 3384.26
like that attitude

3387.359 --> 3390.9
right

3388.68 --> 3394.0789999999997
and the real thing that they were mostly

3390.9 --> 3396.7200000000003
waiting on was me get to get really

3394.079 --> 3399.0
enthusiastic for some reason

3396.72 --> 3400.859
because when that happened that's when

3399.0 --> 3402.839
certainly they would start seducing

3400.859 --> 3404.88
again so that's all very much in

3402.839 --> 3406.02
accordance with the patterns of Rudolph

3404.88 --> 3410.52
Steiner

3406.02 --> 3415.02
like the the archetype ariman Lucifer

3410.52 --> 3416.88
Christ like how Lucifer starts seducing

3415.02 --> 3420.119
you

3416.88 --> 3423.48
when you attain power

3420.119 --> 3426.119
and enthusiasm and is energy

3423.48 --> 3428.46
it is a form of power

3426.119 --> 3432.359
and that's when the well those very

3428.46 --> 3435.839
functional like leaving me alone

3432.359 --> 3438.119
inner demons they'd just be like no okay

3435.839 --> 3440.339
you got it out of control but then much

3438.119 --> 3444.78
energy well then they try things they

3440.339 --> 3449.54
just drain they can't help it

3444.78 --> 3449.5400000000004
I think that's in me it's like yeah

3459.0 --> 3464.28
it's probably kind of come forward even

3461.52 --> 3465.96
like as a typical character trait of me

3464.28 --> 3468.3590000000004
and what I do

3465.96 --> 3470.76
right is what I do with Baldwin I'm

3468.359 --> 3471.7799999999997
trying it's just like yeah but I just

3470.76 --> 3475.1400000000003
have to

3471.78 --> 3478.88
have to do this right

3475.14 --> 3478.8799999999997
just a little different

3481.68 --> 3484.46
okay let's

3499.559 --> 3503.48
yeah don't do that

3519.359 --> 3525.299
try to allow them into my thinking right

3522.359 --> 3527.46
it's the influences

3525.299 --> 3529.619
and in my Dark World Vision I just

3527.46 --> 3531.859
happened to represent them as actual

3529.619 --> 3531.859
people

3532.2 --> 3535.52
they're like slightly off

3546.619 --> 3555.38
yeah indeed sing star water

3550.74 --> 3555.3799999999997
the darkness holds in the light

3568.619 --> 3573.599
another word that's used for the term

3571.5 --> 3577.14
the Dark World

3573.599 --> 3580.559
the other dimension some people may call

3577.14 --> 3581.94
it like the astral plane or something

3580.559 --> 3585.48
thank you

3581.94 --> 3588.38
for the hallucination Dimension Maybe

3585.48 --> 3588.38
I'm not sure

3593.819 --> 3596.9
the other side

3604.93 --> 3608.08
[Music]

3610.44 --> 3615.2400000000002
hmm

3612.66 --> 3618.5589999999997
and fiber outs

3615.24 --> 3618.5589999999997
by the way I could see you

3619.74 --> 3626.4599999999996
do you like like spooky horror things

3623.76 --> 3630.7200000000003
that aren't just like just

3626.46 --> 3634.52
like evil and mean spirit that

3630.72 --> 3637.74
like classic type horror and not like

3634.52 --> 3640.46
gross like societal derangement

3637.74 --> 3640.4599999999996
programming

3641.819 --> 3644.96
you have spooks

3647.76 --> 3650.8190000000004
because yeah there's this Siri that I've

3649.92 --> 3654.359
watched

3650.819 --> 3658.7
I mentioned it a bit earlier on Netflix

3654.359 --> 3658.7
called the cabinets of Curiosities

3659.28 --> 3664.02
I think that you might get a real kick

3661.559 --> 3666.2400000000002
out of it I mean it is

3664.02 --> 3668.04
one of the best

3666.24 --> 3671.64
like

3668.04 --> 3673.619
ghost story like but ghost story and

3671.64 --> 3677.66
horror

3673.619 --> 3677.6600000000003
series that I've ever come across really

3678.119 --> 3680.299
thank you

3681.559 --> 3686.8190000000004
hey there I'm making Merry Christmas

3684.88 --> 3689.6400000000003
[Music]

3686.819 --> 3692.099
a bit uninspired the last few dude

3689.64 --> 3693.5989999999997
just make sure you don't watch it super

3692.099 --> 3696.119
late because

3693.599 --> 3699.44
it is really intense it's gonna get to

3696.119 --> 3699.44
you I mean there it's

3699.54 --> 3706.619
every single episode is like its own

3702.42 --> 3709.26
mini movie and it's scary as [ __ ] every

3706.619 --> 3710.88
single one in different ways in totally

3709.26 --> 3714.98
different ways

3710.88 --> 3714.98
they have like a real

3715.68 --> 3722.0
I don't know it's a really good ghost

3717.78 --> 3722.0
story type series

3724.079 --> 3730.26
but it is actually really scary I mean

3727.4 --> 3733.92
people there's like people with phobias

3730.26 --> 3735.1800000000003
are are gonna like really get nightmares

3733.92 --> 3739.319
from this

3735.18 --> 3743.16
be careful it's actually really scary

3739.319 --> 3746.2799999999997
and not in a jump scare type way

3743.16 --> 3749.72
it doesn't even need that and it's still

3746.28 --> 3749.7200000000003
scare the [ __ ] out of you

3750.95 --> 3758.5499999999997
[Music]

3756.359 --> 3762.18
all right

3758.55 --> 3764.819
[Music]

3762.18 --> 3769.64
in that second episode was just like

3764.819 --> 3769.64
what the [ __ ] man what the [ __ ]

3770.4 --> 3774.0
like I've never seen anything like that

3772.92 --> 3775.7400000000002
ever

3774.0 --> 3778.98
that was just

3775.74 --> 3782.18
what the [ __ ] was that

3778.98 --> 3782.18
holy [ __ ]

3783.05 --> 3792.119
[Music]

3789.54 --> 3793.5
but even the first one and and the third

3792.119 --> 3795.48
one dude

3793.5 --> 3797.04
I'm kind of nervous about watching the

3795.48 --> 3799.319
rest of it because I think there's like

3797.04 --> 3801.9
eight episodes or something

3799.319 --> 3804.859
and the first three are already like

3801.9 --> 3804.859
holy

3804.9 --> 3810.319
[ __ ] watch all the rest I mean

3807.48 --> 3810.319
man

3811.06 --> 3814.19
[Music]

3816.42 --> 3819.02
anyway

3829.04 --> 3833.119
mysterious is actually a globe

3835.02 --> 3840.92
oh what if you actually turned out to be

3838.319 --> 3840.92
a penguin

3841.74 --> 3846.0789999999997
wouldn't you be feeling all foul

3869.18 --> 3874.2599999999998
email okay

3872.46 --> 3877.099
cool

3874.26 --> 3877.099
I hope

3881.76 --> 3887.2900000000004
I haven't gotten the email yet but yeah

3883.859 --> 3892.319
I'll keep a lookout for it

3887.29 --> 3895.5
[Music]

3892.319 --> 3897.0
yeah I mean come on fire I mean

3895.5 --> 3898.619
I'm right

3897.0 --> 3900.359
right

3898.619 --> 3903.0
like what kind of a question is that

3900.359 --> 3905.16
what if the Earth is actually Globe like

3903.0 --> 3906.299
yeah what if you're actually a penguin I

3905.16 --> 3909.0789999999997
mean

3906.299 --> 3909.079
well

3909.299 --> 3913.98
what are you gonna do

3911.819 --> 3916.5589999999997
if it actually turned out that you're a

3913.98 --> 3917.94
penguin and not a human being at all

3916.559 --> 3922.7000000000003
I mean

3917.94 --> 3922.7000000000003
you would be feeling pretty foul

3931.32 --> 3934.3590000000004
[Music]

3938.28 --> 3942.5
toroid on Earth okay

3946.799 --> 3951.799
that's a bit weird though because it's

3949.079 --> 3951.799
actually flat

3953.7 --> 3957.2
what if I actually get

3957.599 --> 3963.619
I don't have to ban him it's just a

3959.76 --> 3963.619
Dumpty [ __ ] he's not saying anything

3971.18 --> 3978.0589999999997
I mean it's just like Christmas dinner

3973.68 --> 3981.839
there's always has to be one always one

3978.059 --> 3983.88
right that's just like oh of course he

3981.839 --> 3986.16
thinks he's suddenly all on top of the

3983.88 --> 3988.619
world and he thinks he's really smart

3986.16 --> 3990.1189999999997
and he's gonna ridicule something that

3988.619 --> 3991.9900000000002
he thinks you're doing and he doesn't

3990.119 --> 3993.96
understand yeah they're just typical

3991.99 --> 3995.9399999999996
[Music]

3993.96 --> 3999.96
no you're excused from the table like

3995.94 --> 4002.05
what no they're just a dumbass

3999.96 --> 4007.61
that's all

4002.05 --> 4007.61
[Music]

4018.26 --> 4023.599
it was an equilibrium was a resonating

4020.539 --> 4025.94
place maybe a bit

4023.599 --> 4030.2200000000003
but I mean that's also

4025.94 --> 4030.2200000000003
well vulnerability on your part

4030.44 --> 4034.52
it's not like he's all spamming and [ __ ]

4032.78 --> 4037.1800000000003
it's just one stupid little message

4034.52 --> 4037.18
that's all

4045.339 --> 4050.98
these two what you mean live chat

4048.319 --> 4050.98
participant

4051.799 --> 4056.66
it's just being flexible I mean toroidal

4054.5 --> 4061.48
Earth is not Globe Earth

4056.66 --> 4061.48
I wonder even what that exactly means

4069.02 --> 4072.38
but I'm all about the rectangular

4071.119 --> 4075.5
looping

4072.38 --> 4078.76
then hey if that if that turns out that

4075.5 --> 4078.76
if you connect that up

4080.18 --> 4085.7799999999997
that it turns into some kind of toroid

4082.16 --> 4085.7799999999997
yeah that's a possibility

4092.539 --> 4097.88
that might just be ah this tension it's

4095.599 --> 4099.649
Christmas Christmas tension don't worry

4097.88 --> 4102.769
about it just take it easy

4099.649 --> 4102.769
[Music]

4104.42 --> 4109.16
rectangular looping is also interesting

4106.64 --> 4112.52
yeah it is especially because

4109.16 --> 4116.5
it's not really like oh this is it this

4112.52 --> 4120.14
is it no it's like no it's looping

4116.5 --> 4123.08
it is probably sort of rectangular but

4120.14 --> 4125.719
we don't really know what how it is all

4123.08 --> 4128.6
actually divided and

4125.719 --> 4131.9
like there could be weird irregularities

4128.6 --> 4136.04
in in the space and how it interconnects

4131.9 --> 4138.879999999999
and we don't exactly know I don't know

4136.04 --> 4138.88
okay

4139.239 --> 4142.239
right

4142.299 --> 4151.12
those shows those

4145.9 --> 4151.12
sketches let me show some of that again

4162.44 --> 4166.3589999999995
right possibilities for

4167.839 --> 4172.48
what it could be

4169.94 --> 4172.48
let's see

4174.14 --> 4181.04
right for different forms of looping

4178.339 --> 4183.44
the straight band looping but yeah if

4181.04 --> 4186.58
it's irregular

4183.44 --> 4186.58
then oh wait

4189.199 --> 4193.7789999999995
then it could look like this

4195.199 --> 4200.599999999999
right

4197.42 --> 4204.4400000000005
if yeah if it's lit yeah then it's like

4200.6 --> 4207.4400000000005
a semi-disc but it could be connected up

4204.44 --> 4209.719
with the north with other realm segments

4207.44 --> 4212.239
or maybe

4209.719 --> 4214.76
it is really kind of like spherical

4212.239 --> 4217.5199999999995
looping

4214.76 --> 4220.04
that the loop just gets shorter the

4217.52 --> 4221.3
further you get to the poles and it's at

4220.04 --> 4223.94
its widest

4221.3 --> 4226.1
at the equator right this is if the

4223.94 --> 4230.599999999999
Equator was actually a straight line

4226.1 --> 4231.7390000000005
like this is a euclidean representation

4230.6 --> 4236.179
right

4231.739 --> 4238.459999999999
but it's outside of the confine

4236.179 --> 4241.4
of the loop because everything that's

4238.46 --> 4244.219
outside of the grid that you see the

4241.4 --> 4247.659
white part that's literally non-existent

4244.219 --> 4247.659
space that's non-space

4248.239 --> 4253.699
right and here's a more top-down view of

4251.6 --> 4256.9400000000005
a circle in a circle in a circle where

4253.699 --> 4259.219
every ring every ring segment

4256.94 --> 4261.0199999999995
in this case right because the ring the

4259.219 --> 4263.12
black ring here

4261.02 --> 4266.540000000001
that's the equator

4263.12 --> 4268.64
and the inner ring that's the North Pole

4266.54 --> 4272.48
sort of but it isn't really a Poe and

4268.64 --> 4274.64
the South South Pole ring right what if

4272.48 --> 4276.5599999999995
they're outside you go outside and guess

4274.64 --> 4279.860000000001
what

4276.56 --> 4281.42
there's another ring segment there and

4279.86 --> 4283.339999999999
it's exactly

4281.42 --> 4286.9400000000005
as big

4283.34 --> 4289.76
as the other one so the realm segment is

4286.94 --> 4293.48
exactly as Big South

4289.76 --> 4296.84
as it is at the north right so let's say

4293.48 --> 4299.48
the middle ring is the terrestrial realm

4296.84 --> 4300.860000000001
that we know well this would be the

4299.48 --> 4303.08
North Pole

4300.86 --> 4305.179
beyond the North Pole well maybe at the

4303.08 --> 4307.4
North Pole there's literally a realm

4305.179 --> 4309.62
that's just as big as this one how would

4307.4 --> 4312.679
that fit literally in the North

4309.62 --> 4315.38
when the equator would be a geometric

4312.679 --> 4317.2390000000005
Circle so this is actually again a

4315.38 --> 4320.4800000000005
euclidean representation

4317.239 --> 4323.32
right these are potential loop system

4320.48 --> 4323.32
possibilities

4323.78 --> 4326.98
pretty trippy right

4336.739 --> 4341.199
is this sphere a circular Loop

4343.219 --> 4345.94
no

4353.0 --> 4357.76
that spheres the Spheres sphere's a

4354.92 --> 4357.76
geometric shape

4358.06 --> 4363.679
these circular Loops that I just showed

4361.76 --> 4366.02
through the sketches

4363.679 --> 4369.88
are all flat

4366.02 --> 4369.88
they're all geometric flap

4374.48 --> 4380.0
that's very cool thank you I mean I take

4377.36 --> 4383.719
my cosmogony very serious

4380.0 --> 4386.719
I I take figuring out the potential

4383.719 --> 4388.82
nature of the realm we live in very

4386.719 --> 4392.44
serious

4388.82 --> 4392.44
no turtles that's right

4399.739 --> 4404.48
clear you gotta come in come on don't

4402.5 --> 4406.28
bring him into this

4404.48 --> 4408.639999999999
I don't want to hear about him during

4406.28 --> 4408.639999999999
Christmas

4409.699 --> 4412.0599999999995
anyway

4420.14 --> 4422.679
foreign

4425.76 --> 4428.959
[Music]

4456.02 --> 4458.14

4575.8 --> 4580.400000000001

4578.239 --> 4584.799999999999
but I mean

4580.4 --> 4584.799999999999
Christmas isn't uh

4588.739 --> 4593.718999999999
it's even weird calling it a Christmas

4590.84 --> 4597.88
tradition really if you just seeing it

4593.719 --> 4597.88
is more like a cultural tradition

4598.88 --> 4601.4800000000005
but

4601.699 --> 4606.08
yeah over here there was a like there

4604.04 --> 4609.64
there's lights and stuff

4606.08 --> 4609.64
and they've been out there

4610.34 --> 4616.84
they have like these decorations

4613.28 --> 4616.84
that they do like in the

4617.42 --> 4622.84
like one of the big streets that has a

4620.06 --> 4622.84
lot of shops there

4623.06 --> 4628.719
they do that sort of thing over here I

4625.159 --> 4628.719
mean that's never really stopped

4639.04 --> 4644.86
what

4640.84 --> 4644.860000000001
are you talking about what

4649.04 --> 4652.3
a few lights here and

4652.64 --> 4658.280000000001
yeah but PJ seen it look attacking

4655.64 --> 4660.62
Christian Traditions I mean isn't this

4658.28 --> 4663.04
just basically because Christmas lights

4660.62 --> 4667.099999999999
cost electricity

4663.04 --> 4670.5199999999995
and the prices have gone up so so high

4667.1 --> 4674.26
that it's just like becoming a real

4670.52 --> 4674.26
pain on the budget and all that

4675.86 --> 4681.58
isn't that

4678.14 --> 4681.58
more logical reason

4695.96 --> 4698.08
okay

4705.219 --> 4710.03
gaining wisdom

4707.48 --> 4713.938999999999
yeah Merry Christmas

4724.28 --> 4731.12
man the weather is really sucky

4728.3 --> 4734.360000000001
I'm so glad I got all stocked up

4731.12 --> 4737.0599999999995
yesterday and don't have to go anywhere

4734.36 --> 4738.679
what even if I yeah there wasn't isn't

4737.06 --> 4740.860000000001
anywhere to go everything's closed right

4738.679 --> 4740.86
now

4741.62 --> 4746.599999999999
hey

4743.0 --> 4749.679
oh Christmas PayPal awesome thanks five

4746.6 --> 4749.679
Rhodes I'll check it out

4767.54 --> 4771.1
whoa foreign

4787.52 --> 4791.360000000001
Rex

4789.739 --> 4793.82
anyway thanks

4791.36 --> 4797.0599999999995
and of course five routes

4793.82 --> 4799.34
so yeah I got two paypals

4797.06 --> 4802.84
thank you very much

4799.34 --> 4802.84
fiber oats and Rex

4805.4 --> 4810.98
anybody in here that's me oh right yeah

4808.28 --> 4813.62
Bill Nye okay so that's you

4810.98 --> 4816.099999999999
thank you sorry if I wasn't supposed to

4813.62 --> 4816.099999999999
say your name

4819.8 --> 4826.159000000001
it's difficult I mean

4823.159 --> 4829.82
it would be very helpful universally if

4826.159 --> 4832.839999999999
you basically put your uh your YouTube

4829.82 --> 4835.82
handle in the PayPal like in a message

4832.84 --> 4838.88
you can add a message

4835.82 --> 4841.639999999999
so then I know exactly who it is it

4838.88 --> 4843.7390000000005
might not because I am really nervous

4841.64 --> 4846.4400000000005
about accidentally

4843.739 --> 4848.9
spelling people's names if they didn't

4846.44 --> 4850.879999999999
want to yeah

4848.9 --> 4853.339999999999
it's more logical that you want to stay

4850.88 --> 4857.32
Anonymous unless you're like on camera

4853.34 --> 4857.32
and all that but that's different

4858.5 --> 4863.9
right so thanks for the PayPal I got

4861.739 --> 4866.239
your email check it out

4863.9 --> 4869.0199999999995
whoa

4866.239 --> 4869.0199999999995
t

4872.0 --> 4874.84
ah

4878.179 --> 4882.62
wow

4880.88 --> 4884.78
ah it's

4882.62 --> 4888.8
it's a little intense

4884.78 --> 4891.5
especially the first one Jesus ah

4888.8 --> 4893.9800000000005
it's cool but it's giving me a bit of a

4891.5 --> 4893.98
headache

4894.8 --> 4898.88
maybe it's the lighting or something I

4896.42 --> 4902.679
don't know whoa

4898.88 --> 4902.679
it's very impressive though

4903.739 --> 4906.879999999999
can I show it

4915.08 --> 4920.12
all right good to know Rex

4921.09 --> 4927.26
[Music]

4924.92 --> 4929.56
yeah five words I just checked checked

4927.26 --> 4929.56
it out

4930.38 --> 4934.6990000000005
I'm just asking uh like is it okay if I

4933.38 --> 4937.2390000000005
show

4934.699 --> 4937.239
okay

4938.06 --> 4941.659000000001
right because they you also have them

4939.98 --> 4945.099999999999
like on your

4941.659 --> 4945.099999999999
on your webshop right

4950.3 --> 4954.52
wait what

4952.04 --> 4954.5199999999995
no

4962.6 --> 4968.02
there you go

4965.0 --> 4968.02
getting there

4975.92 --> 4982.3
right so yeah brace yourself

4979.1 --> 4982.3
prepare yourself

4982.82 --> 4985.719
boom

4996.92 --> 5000.4800000000005
talk about intense

5001.12 --> 5005.14
it's interesting though like when I see

5003.28 --> 5007.599999999999
it really small

5005.14 --> 5009.400000000001
it looks it looks even better I mean

5007.6 --> 5011.92
this painting is like

5009.4 --> 5013.659
very fascinating I think that if you

5011.92 --> 5015.76
like have it on the wall and then like

5013.659 --> 5019.379999999999
take your distance as you're looking at

5015.76 --> 5019.38
it it's really incredible

5019.719 --> 5024.4
it almost looks like it's some kind of

5021.76 --> 5026.64
chemical soup or something at that

5024.4 --> 5026.639999999999
distance

5026.679 --> 5032.7390000000005
pretty amazing I'm very impressed

5029.8 --> 5035.58
all right let's see the other one

5032.739 --> 5035.58
this one

5035.62 --> 5040.0
a little more subtle interesting

5046.9 --> 5049.78
I mean you're getting really good at

5048.76 --> 5052.42
this

5049.78 --> 5053.679
oh you were already pretty good at it

5052.42 --> 5055.719
ah

5053.679 --> 5060.719
is that the same painting by the way

5055.719 --> 5060.719
that you like worked on further

5067.0 --> 5070.86
was this just a wait is that

5071.86 --> 5076.0199999999995
right there are three different ones

5076.179 --> 5081.6
no way this

5078.46 --> 5081.6
oh that is the same

5083.679 --> 5089.76
huh anyway yeah very cool man keep it up

5096.159 --> 5101.759999999999
oh another PayPal awesome thank you B

5099.1 --> 5101.76
just seen it

5102.76 --> 5105.76
foreign

5106.98 --> 5112.0199999999995
yeah I hope you guys are all enjoying

5109.3 --> 5112.02
this Christmas show

5116.32 --> 5119.46
got a little deep

5119.5 --> 5122.1
Maybe

5127.3 --> 5132.9400000000005
I know but it's like usually though I

5130.179 --> 5135.4800000000005
mean Christmas is kind of like for me a

5132.94 --> 5135.48
lot of the times

5138.52 --> 5142.179
it's like Christmas is actually

5140.38 --> 5144.28
Halloween or something

5142.179 --> 5146.6990000000005
because you know the Halloween thing

5144.28 --> 5146.699
they do

5146.98 --> 5152.08
like oh dress up against spooky thingies

5149.86 --> 5153.759999999999
and all that well when the time of the

5152.08 --> 5155.98
year is there with Halloween I don't

5153.76 --> 5158.9800000000005
really like have any kind of feel for

5155.98 --> 5161.678999999999
that at all but during Christmas I kind

5158.98 --> 5164.08
of do and that's also wow how I got

5161.679 --> 5166.719
lured into

5164.08 --> 5171.9
super spooky series

5166.719 --> 5171.9
and they already talked about twice now

5172.9 --> 5176.94
it's like I'm more in the mood for that

5174.58 --> 5176.94
it's like

5179.26 --> 5186.159000000001
I

5181.659 --> 5187.54
I wonder if nah probably not

5186.159 --> 5190.179
but

5187.54 --> 5192.28
just bear with me this is probably

5190.179 --> 5194.56
nonsense but

5192.28 --> 5198.58
like the idea of it like what if

5194.56 --> 5200.620000000001
Halloween and Christmas were originally

5198.58 --> 5204.1
by competing

5200.62 --> 5207.34
celebrations that were at the same time

5204.1 --> 5210.1
and that then

5207.34 --> 5213.719
they kind of transformed it and moved

5210.1 --> 5213.719
Halloween back or something

5225.78 --> 5231.239
I did not

5228.159 --> 5231.239
just thinking out loud

5234.159 --> 5236.879999999999
foreign

5248.88 --> 5254.62
that is like a specific date supposedly

5252.1 --> 5256.3
I just I never have that during

5254.62 --> 5260.26
Halloween

5256.3 --> 5264.159000000001
or maybe I don't anymore maybe like when

5260.26 --> 5267.42
you're more sinful than it does actually

5264.159 --> 5267.42
have an influence

5267.58 --> 5270.3
I don't know

5277.96 --> 5287.08
people that I knew like decades ago and

5282.76 --> 5289.84
all that they certainly were like very

5287.08 --> 5290.98
energetic during Halloween and I was

5289.84 --> 5293.5
always like

5290.98 --> 5297.699
okay

5293.5 --> 5299.92
wow I'm not that excited about it

5297.699 --> 5302.32
but during Christmas time it's like

5299.92 --> 5304.42
that's when I start to kind of start

5302.32 --> 5308.98
feeling like that it's like oh I kind of

5304.42 --> 5312.04
want like big impressive stories and

5308.98 --> 5316.12
maybe scary things and like important

5312.04 --> 5319.0199999999995
things intense intense with the spirit

5316.12 --> 5319.0199999999995
challenging

5329.56 --> 5333.76
and

5331.84 --> 5336.85
foreign

5333.76 --> 5336.85
[Music]

5340.3 --> 5343.369000000001
[Music]

5345.699 --> 5351.94
getting hungry again that's good

5348.94 --> 5355.12
man I had so much food yesterday

5351.94 --> 5358.36
I like even had like a an extra dinner

5355.12 --> 5360.34
like after midnight probably part of the

5358.36 --> 5363.46
reason why it was up so late

5360.34 --> 5366.1
shouldn't really do that again but I was

5363.46 --> 5369.46
just felt feeling like no I want to be

5366.1 --> 5372.219
I want to be stuffed this time and I

5369.46 --> 5374.44
also yeah I completely forgot to mention

5372.219 --> 5376.719
anything about it yeah yeah my back

5374.44 --> 5381.04
problems yeah

5376.719 --> 5384.52
totally gone it's completely done now

5381.04 --> 5386.5
I'm super flexible I made effort

5384.52 --> 5390.42
in bed

5386.5 --> 5390.42
last night to really like

5390.639 --> 5394.96
like make effort to stretch it basically

5393.1 --> 5396.34
takes some risk

5394.96 --> 5399.04
because everything is really

5396.34 --> 5403.2390000000005
regenerating and like really loosen it

5399.04 --> 5406.96
up and that worked really well

5403.239 --> 5409.239
also I'm noticing like I've kind of like

5406.96 --> 5411.46
not done that in a while which is

5409.239 --> 5413.259999999999
probably the reason why I got that

5411.46 --> 5415.06
sprained back situation in the first

5413.26 --> 5419.02
place because I kind of been neglecting

5415.06 --> 5421.8
it a bit I guess shouldn't be doing that

5419.02 --> 5421.8
right

5425.56 --> 5430.6
I mean you both Celtic holidays is that

5428.62 --> 5432.5199999999995
correct

5430.6 --> 5434.679
uh

5432.52 --> 5437.080000000001
sure

5434.679 --> 5439.27
I guess I don't know what specifically

5437.08 --> 5441.88
Celtic but

5439.27 --> 5445.3
[Music]

5441.88 --> 5447.219
I mean that's like uh classic paganism

5445.3 --> 5451.360000000001
it's just these what is it the eight

5447.219 --> 5455.08
moments of the year right this is like

5451.36 --> 5455.08
very rudimentary

5455.98 --> 5459.718999999999
like whoa

5460.12 --> 5464.5599999999995
very rudimentary sort of Witchcraft lore

5462.88 --> 5466.179
but not

5464.56 --> 5467.679
I mean it doesn't mean that

5466.179 --> 5470.08
automatically you're gonna deal with

5467.679 --> 5471.52
Devi's [ __ ] or anything it's just

5470.08 --> 5474.699
basic

5471.52 --> 5475.719
witchcraft lore like I even have a book

5474.699 --> 5478.178999999999
of that

5475.719 --> 5480.76
that's of that's thing specifically

5478.179 --> 5482.4400000000005
about the the eight

5480.76 --> 5484.84
things

5482.44 --> 5489.28
and there's no mention of freaking baby

5484.84 --> 5492.6
sacrificing crap in there it's all super

5489.28 --> 5492.599999999999
legal and good

5495.52 --> 5499.719
all right

5496.78 --> 5501.58
drives me nuts every time like supposed

5499.719 --> 5505.2390000000005
Christians

5501.58 --> 5507.46
start whining about how paganism is only

5505.239 --> 5509.5
about human sacrifice and all that crap

5507.46 --> 5511.84
I freaking cannot stand that they do

5509.5 --> 5514.32
that it's such a

5511.84 --> 5514.32
just

5521.5 --> 5526.3
I mean really when you think about it

5523.54 --> 5527.82
start to like just consider for a second

5526.3 --> 5530.92
okay that

5527.82 --> 5533.139
Christians saying that ah pagans all

5530.92 --> 5536.92
your celebrations are just about

5533.139 --> 5538.659000000001
like human sacrifice and [ __ ] for the

5536.92 --> 5540.9400000000005
Harvest or whatever right that's

5538.659 --> 5543.239
probably how Christians see that it's

5540.94 --> 5547.599999999999
like a pagan telling a Christian like

5543.239 --> 5550.178999999999
yeah guess what your religion is all

5547.6 --> 5552.219
about double speaking and raping

5550.179 --> 5554.219
children

5552.219 --> 5557.26
because look at what

5554.219 --> 5559.679
right am I right isn't that just the

5557.26 --> 5559.679
same thing

5560.08 --> 5565.6
calling all paint guns all like bloody

5563.56 --> 5568.1990000000005
Bale worshipers or something like what

5565.6 --> 5568.1990000000005
the [ __ ] man

5576.85 --> 5579.959000000001
[Music]

5597.28 --> 5600.42
stomach upset

5601.139 --> 5606.719
5G City what

5604.0 --> 5606.719
uh

5606.82 --> 5612.4
I think he would have noticed that

5608.5 --> 5615.159
sooner than George Sanford

5612.4 --> 5617.799999999999
but hey that happens I mean people get

5615.159 --> 5620.379999999999
sick dude uh I was watching

5617.8 --> 5624.46
this once again uh

5620.38 --> 5629.159000000001
Paul Cook guy that is like about

5624.46 --> 5633.34
like monolithic ruins and making uh like

5629.159 --> 5635.86
making composite stone and all that

5633.34 --> 5638.62
all that stuff he's sick right now so it

5635.86 --> 5642.28
people do get sick

5638.62 --> 5645.159
also typically during Christmas

5642.28 --> 5646.659
I've had that a few times in the past

5645.159 --> 5648.4
too

5646.659 --> 5650.138999999999
but I yeah I don't really get sick

5648.4 --> 5652.659
anymore during Christmas

5650.139 --> 5655.12
haven't had in a long time then again I

5652.659 --> 5657.94
have not been part of like oh I have to

5655.12 --> 5659.38
now sit in between family that are gonna

5657.94 --> 5661.839999999999
bicker

5659.38 --> 5663.159000000001
because that probably contributes to

5661.84 --> 5665.82
getting sick

5663.159 --> 5665.82
actually

5679.3 --> 5683.820000000001
a m2n yeah Merry Christmas

5686.44 --> 5691.169999999999
[Music]

5695.56 --> 5697.7390000000005
foreign

5716.639 --> 5720.4800000000005
ERS by the way merry Christmas

5720.659 --> 5725.62
right I hope you are all having a nice

5723.28 --> 5727.8
Christmas situation

5725.62 --> 5727.8
foreign

5730.62 --> 5735.88
going there going to have Christmas

5733.42 --> 5738.659
dinner tomorrow so probably will not

5735.88 --> 5738.659000000001
have a show tomorrow

5739.54 --> 5745.96
but maybe I will I'm not sure

5742.659 --> 5748.42
it'll be like kind of last minute though

5745.96 --> 5751.8
no I think I'm gonna skip tomorrow so

5748.42 --> 5751.8
tomorrow is my day off

5759.82 --> 5763.96
what

5761.139 --> 5766.9800000000005
the time what were you talking to

5763.96 --> 5766.9800000000005
gaining wisdom

5787.06 --> 5792.360000000001
well what who are you talking to gaining

5790.06 --> 5792.360000000001
wisdom

5799.78 --> 5808.139
are you talking about my looping Realm

5803.88 --> 5808.139
potential design diagrams

5808.719 --> 5812.62
like what does that have to do with meta

5811.3 --> 5813.8
symbol what

5812.62 --> 5821.46
I don't get it

5813.8 --> 5821.46
[Music]

5833.8 --> 5839.679
right but look with the looping diagrams

5836.86 --> 5843.599999999999
it's only logical that it's that there's

5839.679 --> 5843.6
three segments because it's like yeah

5844.3 --> 5850.659000000001
it's logical to assume as a default that

5848.02 --> 5852.9400000000005
this segment that we're in is the

5850.659 --> 5855.159
central segment

5852.94 --> 5857.5
if there's more

5855.159 --> 5860.679
or if there's a lot more yeah then it

5857.5 --> 5862.659
then it's not really relevant but I've

5860.679 --> 5864.52
always assumed like okay if there's

5862.659 --> 5866.739
going to be more land then it's likely

5864.52 --> 5867.9400000000005
that there's going to be like two more

5866.739 --> 5870.099999999999
worlds

5867.94 --> 5870.94
sort of one to the north one to the

5870.1 --> 5873.04
South

5870.94 --> 5873.71
to make us Middle Earth or something

5873.04 --> 5875.139
right

5873.71 --> 5879.0
[Music]

5875.139 --> 5879.0
but there could be more segments

5879.699 --> 5884.259999999999
but maybe not maybe

5881.56 --> 5887.1990000000005
like when you go to the north do when

5884.26 --> 5891.88
you maybe when you get to the North

5887.199 --> 5895.659
pole edge of the realm North to us

5891.88 --> 5898.719
maybe that directly connects as a loop

5895.659 --> 5903.04
with the southern

5898.719 --> 5905.52
line of the realm South to us

5903.04 --> 5905.5199999999995
oh

5905.8 --> 5910.62
just like the East Loops to the West

5910.659 --> 5914.759999999999
without other segments there

5924.639 --> 5930.52
I'm gonna start a dream journal

5928.96 --> 5931.6
uh

5930.52 --> 5933.219
warnings

5931.6 --> 5935.8
[Music]

5933.219 --> 5938.199
I don't know that depends on what that

5935.8 --> 5940.12
means five roads

5938.199 --> 5942.099999999999
and if you're just gonna like make a

5940.12 --> 5943.84
discipline to quickly write your dreams

5942.1 --> 5945.58
down

5943.84 --> 5948.04
right well you're gonna have to be

5945.58 --> 5950.5
analytical then right because

5948.04 --> 5953.0199999999995
you're never gonna get like the full

5950.5 --> 5955.9
scope feeling context of what you're

5953.02 --> 5957.219
experiencing when you dream

5955.9 --> 5959.739
so

5957.219 --> 5961.42
try to not focus if you're gonna try to

5959.739 --> 5963.5199999999995
describe things in from your dream try

5961.42 --> 5965.8
not to focus on that necessarily unless

5963.52 --> 5968.92
you can immediately connect it with a

5965.8 --> 5971.320000000001
with a very logical context

5968.92 --> 5973.4800000000005
to basically put it into words

5971.32 --> 5974.679
but if you do that then you focus more

5973.48 --> 5978.699
on the meaning of the dream in

5974.679 --> 5980.8
describing it rather than well like the

5978.699 --> 5983.159
actual visual elements that you might be

5980.8 --> 5983.159000000001
perceiving

5984.34 --> 5990.219
so are you gonna actually

5986.58 --> 5993.239
analyze the visuals

5990.219 --> 5996.04
the sensor is like that or are you gonna

5993.239 --> 6000.199
analyze like the reason they're there in

5996.04 --> 6000.199
the like the emotional

6001.5 --> 6004.76
expression of the dream

6007.32 --> 6011.0599999999995
Astro trap what what

6012.6 --> 6017.659000000001
why are you gonna do that

6015.12 --> 6017.659
foreign

6026.639 --> 6031.62
what are you gonna do what's the purpose

6029.28 --> 6033.179
right I mean if you're gonna like tap

6031.62 --> 6034.44
into the Dark World you better have a

6033.179 --> 6036.719
damn good mission

6034.44 --> 6038.82
or you'll get in trouble

6036.719 --> 6043.08
right you don't have a damn good Mission

6038.82 --> 6045.32
then the demons will find a mission for

6043.08 --> 6045.32
you

6045.48 --> 6049.5199999999995
explore yeah it doesn't work that way

6051.179 --> 6057.54
if you don't have a more specific

6053.4 --> 6063.08
intended goal in mind as you enter

6057.54 --> 6063.08
then that goal will be imposed upon you

6071.94 --> 6076.678999999999
in a fight right now what

6074.88 --> 6079.02
dude did you just take careless

6076.679 --> 6082.5
energetics

6079.02 --> 6086.780000000001
fiber outs I don't exactly appreciate

6082.5 --> 6086.78
you just doing that all of a sudden

6087.0 --> 6091.62
without at least by giving me some heads

6090.06 --> 6093.8
up that you're planning something like

6091.62 --> 6093.8
that

6106.04 --> 6110.219
in the flight Planet oh you're meaning

6108.6 --> 6113.96
an actual fight

6110.219 --> 6113.96
what with who

6124.739 --> 6128.48
I already gave you some advice

6151.92 --> 6160.9400000000005
that's interesting PGC net yeah maybe

6157.139 --> 6165.56
I mean it'll help you focus right focus

6160.94 --> 6165.5599999999995
on the experience get more out of it

6168.0 --> 6173.219
I mean you perceive a lot of things in

6170.219 --> 6176.34
your dreams it's just that

6173.219 --> 6179.699
it's kind of tedious to

6176.34 --> 6181.619000000001
to start Translating that into real

6179.699 --> 6184.28
world things

6181.619 --> 6184.28
sometimes

6188.04 --> 6193.08
I'm getting my ask if I what I thought

6190.619 --> 6194.639
were my thoughts

6193.08 --> 6197.639
okay

6194.639 --> 6197.639
why

6198.81 --> 6201.939
[Music]

6206.28 --> 6211.679
what what is it what are those thoughts

6208.98 --> 6214.0199999999995
and how are they

6211.679 --> 6218.2390000000005
dominating you

6214.02 --> 6218.2390000000005
is there a longing for it secretly

6220.63 --> 6223.6990000000005
[Music]

6244.619 --> 6247.159
foreign

6256.24 --> 6259.3
[Music]

6271.4 --> 6275.33
my mother used to do that with me as a

6274.02 --> 6277.5
kid

6275.33 --> 6279.239
[Music]

6277.5 --> 6280.98
because I would like to sleep all over

6279.239 --> 6283.0199999999995
the place and then when I woke up I

6280.98 --> 6284.699
would have like these amazing dreams and

6283.02 --> 6286.5
I would immediately start talking about

6284.699 --> 6289.28
them eventually my mother just started

6286.5 --> 6289.28
writing them out

6291.8 --> 6296.34
did you ever consider pursuing a

6294.3 --> 6297.659000000001
psychology psychology career when you

6296.34 --> 6300.02
were younger yeah what do you think I've

6297.659 --> 6300.0199999999995
been doing

6301.219 --> 6308.42
I am a lame and psychologist I don't

6304.38 --> 6308.42
have any papers and I don't give a [ __ ]

6309.3 --> 6313.9800000000005
psychologist is exactly what I wanted to

6311.88 --> 6317.52
become or well not

6313.98 --> 6319.799999999999
not the way that the the typical job is

6317.52 --> 6321.900000000001
portrayed

6319.8 --> 6325.26
but it's always been drawn to psychology

6321.9 --> 6328.04
I've always had the predisposition for

6325.26 --> 6328.04
understanding it

6337.26 --> 6342.08
right I took the know thyself

6343.04 --> 6349.679
serious to the max in that sense it's

6347.04 --> 6351.06
like oh oh really no thyself oh okay so

6349.679 --> 6352.5
everybody's just like oh you have to

6351.06 --> 6354.2390000000005
just figure out something about yourself

6352.5 --> 6356.28
and I'm like no no no that actually

6354.239 --> 6357.419999999999
means you have to understand every

6356.28 --> 6359.04
single

6357.42 --> 6360.96
fiber

6359.04 --> 6363.48
of your spirit

6360.96 --> 6365.699
know exactly what it is even if it

6363.48 --> 6366.959999999999
doesn't fit conventional ways of

6365.699 --> 6370.138999999999
thinking

6366.96 --> 6373.56
like I want to actually know what what

6370.139 --> 6375.119
my spirit is like how it is and why it

6373.56 --> 6378.5
is the way it is

6375.119 --> 6378.5
so yeah psychology

6401.9 --> 6406.5199999999995
they're being attacked by something

6403.92 --> 6406.52
separate

6407.94 --> 6411.719
okay

6409.199 --> 6415.58
yeah I

6411.719 --> 6415.58
I'm not really getting a

6417.6 --> 6423.5
I'm not getting a hint here spiritually

6420.179 --> 6423.5
if I were outside I don't know

6436.5 --> 6443.1
if I'm bringing okay

6439.619 --> 6445.38
or in that case now I have something I

6443.1 --> 6447.4800000000005
mean if you are like in an abusive

6445.38 --> 6448.7390000000005
upbringing

6447.48 --> 6450.78
rough

6448.739 --> 6453.299999999999
well that means that your spirit

6450.78 --> 6456.199
actually starts longing for that

6453.3 --> 6456.1990000000005
and so

6456.3 --> 6462.6
if you then Escape that situation you

6460.92 --> 6465.119
might with your conscience be like oh

6462.6 --> 6466.56
yes finally I'm done with it but in the

6465.119 --> 6469.0199999999995
meantime you've been conditioned all

6466.56 --> 6471.719
your life to function like that and it

6469.02 --> 6474.540000000001
could be that well your demons are

6471.719 --> 6476.58
basically taking over that task

6474.54 --> 6478.44
because you they're actually there to

6476.58 --> 6481.5
provide a service

6478.44 --> 6484.739
you just will be consciously struggling

6481.5 --> 6486.0
with it because that is what that is

6484.739 --> 6487.678999999999
right

6486.0 --> 6489.54
this is being punished trying to figure

6487.679 --> 6492.06
out why what

6489.54 --> 6494.159
and adapt and like find the inner

6492.06 --> 6496.7390000000005
strength that is the addicting thing

6494.159 --> 6499.08
about it your Consciousness might not

6496.739 --> 6501.119
like it when it happens

6499.08 --> 6503.5199999999995
but your entire being

6501.119 --> 6506.639
probably will

6503.52 --> 6508.619000000001
right I mean your body doesn't care how

6506.639 --> 6510.900000000001
you think you're feeling

6508.619 --> 6514.0199999999995
a feeling as a feeling and any feeling

6510.9 --> 6516.299999999999
can be addictive to your body

6514.02 --> 6519.540000000001
even when your mind thinks you hate it

6516.3 --> 6521.719
right even hate itself is addictive like

6519.54 --> 6521.719
that

6525.84 --> 6530.719
without being eaten yeah okay that's

6528.3 --> 6530.719
gross

6535.619 --> 6539.58
right well maybe they're there as a

6537.78 --> 6543.239
challenge

6539.58 --> 6546.36
for you to cut yourself off from that

6543.239 --> 6548.099999999999
Old way of living

6546.36 --> 6550.259999999999
right I mean

6548.1 --> 6552.06
if you're if you've been abused in some

6550.26 --> 6554.400000000001
way

6552.06 --> 6556.860000000001
that will follow you even after the view

6554.4 --> 6558.119
stops and will typically Express itself

6556.86 --> 6559.619
in dreams

6558.119 --> 6563.119
why is that

6559.619 --> 6563.119
because you're not letting it go

6564.139 --> 6569.400000000001
and letting it go is not like even about

6566.639 --> 6572.58
a conscious act it's about your being

6569.4 --> 6574.5
having that energy that frequency as

6572.58 --> 6576.239
part of how you're functioning and

6574.5 --> 6580.76
you're doing things

6576.239 --> 6580.759999999999
and to get it out is very difficult

6582.06 --> 6588.96
because if it's out you're probably not

6585.179 --> 6590.34
gonna feel like you because of that

6588.96 --> 6593.04
because

6590.34 --> 6595.5
traits of why how you normally would

6593.04 --> 6597.36
have felt always are missing and so you

6595.5 --> 6600.32
kind of don't recognize yourself and

6597.36 --> 6603.54
you'll be more inclined to instinctively

6600.32 --> 6606.0599999999995
recreate those situations and if not in

6603.54 --> 6609.26
the physical world than in your dreams

6606.06 --> 6609.26
hope this makes sense

6623.46 --> 6627.179
foreign

6625.619 --> 6628.98
yeah

6627.179 --> 6631.46
feel guilt when things are going well

6628.98 --> 6631.459999999999
yeah

6642.54 --> 6646.46
right well that's the challenge then

6646.86 --> 6651.599999999999
it's that guilt when things are going

6649.08 --> 6654.9
well the guilt is obstructing the

6651.6 --> 6657.860000000001
effectiveness of your moments of

6654.9 --> 6662.239
Well when things are going well

6657.86 --> 6665.099999999999
so unless you can tame that guilt into

6662.239 --> 6667.678999999999
attaining a stable function on the long

6665.1 --> 6670.02
run like a reminder that isn't actually

6667.679 --> 6673.32
obstructive

6670.02 --> 6675.06
then if you can't do that you might just

6673.32 --> 6676.799999999999
need to like

6675.06 --> 6680.9400000000005
ban it

6676.8 --> 6684.0
that's very difficult and strenuous

6680.94 --> 6686.28
because if you stop guilt

6684.0 --> 6689.82
feeling from when things are going well

6686.28 --> 6693.179
then that will very likely result it

6689.82 --> 6695.219
expressing itself in manic in Mania

6693.179 --> 6697.8
instead because then it goes well and it

6695.219 --> 6700.26
will go elastic the other way right A

6697.8 --> 6701.9400000000005
lot of the time guilt when things are

6700.26 --> 6703.92
going well are actually kind of a

6701.94 --> 6707.4
mechanical function there

6703.92 --> 6711.26
to prevent you from going manic

6707.4 --> 6711.259999999999
and ruining things that way

6712.02 --> 6716.76
like a lid

6714.6 --> 6720.02
to keep it

6716.76 --> 6720.02
on a stable level

6721.26 --> 6724.9400000000005
so consider that as well

6730.02 --> 6734.339000000001
[Music]

6743.76 --> 6748.8
right but but you do see I hope you do

6747.48 --> 6751.86
see that

6748.8 --> 6753.6
most of the challenges right that God's

6751.86 --> 6756.299999999999
God gives you

6753.6 --> 6759.4400000000005
is about your perspective on what you're

6756.3 --> 6759.4400000000005
actually experiencing

6760.5 --> 6764.58
why does it just explain I didn't go

6762.6 --> 6767.04
like oh you feel guilt because things

6764.58 --> 6768.84
are going well like oh bad bad don't

6767.04 --> 6771.36
feel guilty when things are going well

6768.84 --> 6773.400000000001
that's bad no no I'm saying no hold on

6771.36 --> 6774.96
look

6773.4 --> 6777.119
in my experience from what I've seen

6774.96 --> 6780.659
with other people it sometimes fulfills

6777.119 --> 6782.88
a function so before you just take it

6780.659 --> 6786.179
off and throw it away realize what would

6782.88 --> 6789.0
happen when you do that think about it

6786.179 --> 6791.6
maybe test it

6789.0 --> 6791.6
right

6799.739 --> 6802.04
right

6802.98 --> 6807.379999999999
yeah I'm not by the way fully

6807.78 --> 6812.58
knowledgeable on what it is really like

6810.659 --> 6815.839999999999
to have a terrible upbringing I mean

6812.58 --> 6817.32
I've seen people that were traumatized

6815.84 --> 6819.360000000001
[Music]

6817.32 --> 6821.82
thank you

6819.36 --> 6824.96
I don't know a lot of people that

6821.82 --> 6827.759999999999
actually had abuse at home in some way

6824.96 --> 6829.02
that got out of it unscathed I don't

6827.76 --> 6831.179
know any

6829.02 --> 6835.159000000001
there were all of the people I never met

6831.179 --> 6835.159
that had that were basically wrecks

6835.38 --> 6840.900000000001
I'm not saying that you are that at all

6837.239 --> 6842.459999999999
you seem to be kind of like

6840.9 --> 6844.5599999999995
not that

6842.46 --> 6848.36
but I don't I haven't met a lot of

6844.56 --> 6848.360000000001
people in my life like that

6854.0 --> 6858.36
so I'm actually kind of impressed by

6856.38 --> 6859.86
Rose

6858.36 --> 6862.44
right

6859.86 --> 6866.28
but yeah I mean if you had that kind of

6862.44 --> 6870.739
background you're gonna have some

6866.28 --> 6870.739
things to work on but you know that

6871.5 --> 6877.699
and you seem to be doing that so yeah

6873.78 --> 6877.699
sorry if it got all personal like that

6900.38 --> 6904.08
positive strength receiver okay that's

6903.06 --> 6905.88
good

6904.08 --> 6907.679
right

6905.88 --> 6909.3
well that's important I mean if there's

6907.679 --> 6911.6990000000005
like

6909.3 --> 6913.92
if there were simply factors

6911.699 --> 6915.78
in people's impulses that were not under

6913.92 --> 6918.42
control yeah abusive things can happen

6915.78 --> 6921.239
but as long as

6918.42 --> 6924.4400000000005
you're not being neglected

6921.239 --> 6928.5
right as long as you're still given like

6924.44 --> 6931.4
strong Moments by your parents then that

6928.5 --> 6931.4
works out great

6931.86 --> 6936.299999999999
I mean I've had strong moments from my

6934.02 --> 6938.34
parents but I've also had a bit of

6936.3 --> 6941.820000000001
neglect

6938.34 --> 6943.8
but they never like really abused me

6941.82 --> 6947.099999999999
physically or anything or try to

6943.8 --> 6949.26
manipulate me mentally well until my

6947.1 --> 6952.58
mother basically went insane

6949.26 --> 6952.58
and sick

6954.42 --> 6958.139
but yeah that

6956.04 --> 6960.78
that wasn't like the general situation

6958.139 --> 6964.02
at all my parents were really loving

6960.78 --> 6965.639
and carrying an extremely patient which

6964.02 --> 6967.7390000000005
was extremely necessary because

6965.639 --> 6970.159000000001
otherwise everybody would have gone

6967.739 --> 6970.159
insane

6972.85 --> 6976.5
[Music]

6974.4 --> 6978.0
though so yeah never was mistreated in

6976.5 --> 6982.56
any way but

6978.0 --> 6984.36
a bit of neglect here and there

6982.56 --> 6986.52
right I mean they tried to give me

6984.36 --> 6988.619
freedom but it ended up in kind of like

6986.52 --> 6992.580000000001
letting me wander around and I even like

6988.619 --> 6995.78
tried to communicate like I helped me

6992.58 --> 6995.78
and they just didn't understand

6995.94 --> 7000.678999999999
they didn't see what was happening to me

6999.1 --> 7004.360000000001
[Music]

7000.679 --> 7004.36
part of that reason I come here okay

7015.1 --> 7019.52
yeah

7016.82 --> 7022.599999999999
I mean I really hope you got a strong

7019.52 --> 7022.6
stomach because

7022.94 --> 7026.96
mine is not as strong as I hoped

7024.92 --> 7029.2390000000005
although it's still fine

7026.96 --> 7032.659
it's not gonna be like oh my god when I

7029.239 --> 7035.119
get older I'm gonna have a stomach like

7032.659 --> 7037.58
I'm gonna die from that no no no it's

7035.119 --> 7040.219
not like that but yeah

7037.58 --> 7044.44
since I've like more developed my

7040.219 --> 7044.44
empathy my stomach is suffering more

7044.659 --> 7051.379999999999
but that's literally the energy

7048.099 --> 7054.56
right that's how like sometimes I'm like

7051.38 --> 7057.7390000000005
oh [ __ ] I feel wonky oh I gotta end the

7054.56 --> 7059.06
show right now I'm sick that's exactly

7057.739 --> 7063.259999999999
because of that

7059.06 --> 7065.0
right and that sort of thing I didn't

7063.26 --> 7068.360000000001
have

7065.0 --> 7071.42
when I was a teen

7068.36 --> 7074.78
at all I never had that

7071.42 --> 7076.639
I at those times things would like I

7074.78 --> 7081.5199999999995
would like have enormous energy

7076.639 --> 7084.92
Ascension moment but barely any

7081.52 --> 7086.780000000001
procedures or plan to do anything with

7084.92 --> 7088.76
it is such a waste

7086.78 --> 7091.0
in retrospect but yeah there's nothing I

7088.76 --> 7091.0
could do

7091.099 --> 7096.76
now I can't do it like that anymore I

7094.28 --> 7096.759999999999
get sick

7099.739 --> 7104.9
unless

7101.36 --> 7107.38
yeah unless it just somehow works out

7104.9 --> 7107.379999999999
great

7112.219 --> 7117.679
right because to me it's really like you

7115.099 --> 7119.659000000001
just get packages of information and the

7117.679 --> 7123.139
weight of all that and that weight's

7119.659 --> 7125.48
gonna go directly to my stomach unless I

7123.139 --> 7127.76
can literally find a way through and

7125.48 --> 7131.54
neutralize some of that tension

7127.76 --> 7134.599
with purpose and hope and a plan

7131.54 --> 7137.0
or a general idea of how to deal with it

7134.599 --> 7138.9800000000005
and then that tension doesn't really

7137.0 --> 7142.84
make me sick anymore

7138.98 --> 7142.839999999999
it's literally finding a way through it

7147.08 --> 7150.76
it's always messed up oh [ __ ]

7153.8 --> 7156.6990000000005
okay that sucks

7158.179 --> 7164.3
so you're a worse

7161.119 --> 7166.5199999999995
well it yours aren't as bad as good

7164.3 --> 7169.099
servants was because his stomach now

7166.52 --> 7171.56
that one is totally [ __ ] up

7169.099 --> 7173.659000000001
and dysfunctional it's a miracle really

7171.56 --> 7176.599
when you think about if you yeah I'm not

7173.659 --> 7181.28
gonna go into the full detail but if you

7176.599 --> 7183.4400000000005
if yeah you all knew exactly what he had

7181.28 --> 7185.36
you'll realize it's always kind of a

7183.44 --> 7188.299999999999
miracle he survived that long because

7185.36 --> 7190.719
his stomach issues were really really

7188.3 --> 7190.719
bad

7192.199 --> 7196.419999999999
so

7194.719 --> 7200.619
ah

7196.42 --> 7200.619
it's abstract noise it is

7200.719 --> 7204.219
whatever it feels

7204.32 --> 7208.219
that's weird so you don't have any

7206.3 --> 7210.56
feeling in your stomach is that what

7208.219 --> 7213.58
you're saying it's like

7210.56 --> 7213.580000000001
numb or something

7214.099 --> 7216.76
that's weird

7220.58 --> 7228.98
because my stomach issues are mostly

7224.42 --> 7230.3
like that I get sick or acid reflux

7228.98 --> 7233.178999999999
but

7230.3 --> 7236.179
yeah the acid reflux is not all that

7233.179 --> 7238.219
terrible it had worse

7236.179 --> 7240.139
a lot worse in the past

7238.219 --> 7243.02
but since my diet

7240.139 --> 7246.400000000001
is careful I don't have do not have that

7243.02 --> 7246.400000000001
bad issue with it at all

7249.739 --> 7254.9
always feels well Jesus

7253.099 --> 7257.42
there must be something that can be done

7254.9 --> 7260.839999999999
about that I mean have you ever had like

7257.42 --> 7262.88
an actual good lay on hands healer

7260.84 --> 7264.8
I mean

7262.88 --> 7267.32
I don't want to say like dude you need

7264.8 --> 7268.6990000000005
somebody like my healer because since

7267.32 --> 7271.159
you're an empath

7268.699 --> 7273.379999999999
right I too

7271.159 --> 7276.199
get like [ __ ]

7273.38 --> 7277.82
from the outside Spirits tags all kinds

7276.199 --> 7280.219
of things on me

7277.82 --> 7282.5
and that is like a real burden for an

7280.219 --> 7286.2390000000005
empath like that's literal weight you

7282.5 --> 7286.239
constantly carry on your spirit like

7286.52 --> 7292.52
and since he first started getting rid

7289.94 --> 7294.82
of that it's like literally you're a new

7292.52 --> 7294.820000000001
person

7295.28 --> 7299.259999999999
here's booking for one super hard

7299.84 --> 7304.82
I think I'm gonna talk to my healer

7302.42 --> 7307.9
about you maybe see if I can get you

7304.82 --> 7307.9
into contact with him

7308.3 --> 7312.219
I don't know if he'll do it though

7312.44 --> 7316.58
but maybe you can do something at a

7314.3 --> 7318.139
distance because he can even do dude he

7316.58 --> 7320.92
can heal people without them even

7318.139 --> 7320.92
knowing about it

7321.26 --> 7326.54
it's only positive things by the way and

7324.199 --> 7327.86
funnily enough sometimes it's like the

7326.54 --> 7331.099
angels

7327.86 --> 7333.199
just like tell him like uh yeah that

7331.099 --> 7334.900000000001
person they they can't be healed they

7333.199 --> 7338.178999999999
have to sit through this specifically

7334.9 --> 7340.879999999999
because of something they did

7338.179 --> 7343.159
and then nobody we don't know what that

7340.88 --> 7345.26
is but it's just like yeah no that

7343.159 --> 7348.159
person can be healed

7345.26 --> 7348.159000000001
it's not allowed

7349.04 --> 7353.599
Be Live Safe okay okay if I were I

7351.5 --> 7356.36
didn't know it was that serious I I will

7353.599 --> 7359.54
I will the first thing

7356.36 --> 7361.58
the first time the first the next time

7359.54 --> 7363.86
I'm contacting my healer I'm gonna bring

7361.58 --> 7367.76
you up see if you can do something

7363.86 --> 7369.739
stomach issues right mostly stomach

7367.76 --> 7370.6990000000005
can you give me a little bit more detail

7369.739 --> 7373.159
about

7370.699 --> 7376.48
the type of experience don't have to be

7373.159 --> 7376.48
super elaborate just like

7379.119 --> 7385.78
how would you this how would you

7381.739 --> 7385.78
summarize a good description

7386.36 --> 7389.78
uh by the way you don't have to say this

7388.159 --> 7392.36
in chat I mean this is getting all very

7389.78 --> 7394.28
personal you can email it me too

7392.36 --> 7397.159
actually it would be better if you email

7394.28 --> 7400.94
it me because then I have that in my

7397.159 --> 7403.598999999999
email that I can look it up back

7400.94 --> 7403.598999999999
right

7409.639 --> 7412.179
what

7412.46 --> 7416.96
you do you can hey look if you want to

7415.219 --> 7420.38
share all those details in my chat

7416.96 --> 7424.659
that's fine I'm just saying

7420.38 --> 7424.659000000001
you could also email me the details

7433.82 --> 7438.679
right

7436.159 --> 7441.638999999999
most importantly just

7438.679 --> 7441.639
take it easy

7442.46 --> 7447.34
remember that during Christmas there is

7444.739 --> 7447.339999999999
a tension

7447.619 --> 7454.699
and then usually that dies down and then

7451.099 --> 7457.219
after the New Year it's like gone

7454.699 --> 7459.379999999999
and then you get like the weird void and

7457.219 --> 7460.34
sometimes people get depressed

7459.38 --> 7463.719
right

7460.34 --> 7463.719
don't be lying okay

7465.139 --> 7469.42
proud

7466.46 --> 7469.42
take it easy

7472.219 --> 7477.56
the trick is most likely that you're

7474.739 --> 7479.659
holding on to something with tension

7477.56 --> 7482.599
and that you're then projecting that

7479.659 --> 7486.679
you're not able to attain it

7482.599 --> 7489.619000000001
right even when my healer does his thing

7486.679 --> 7492.32
that is exactly what he resolves

7489.619 --> 7494.299999999999
because people end up holding themselves

7492.32 --> 7495.679
back and not even realizing that they're

7494.3 --> 7497.360000000001
doing it it's just something that

7495.679 --> 7499.639
happens subconsciously and they fall

7497.36 --> 7501.38
into that position mechanism and then

7499.639 --> 7503.54
they hold on and they look from that

7501.38 --> 7505.52
view and it can't look away

7503.54 --> 7507.32
well it's all about letting go well in

7505.52 --> 7509.900000000001
while you're in a few it's very hard to

7507.32 --> 7514.34
let go because you're like right in it

7509.9 --> 7516.199
and healer can somehow just like go

7514.34 --> 7519.219
inside your subconscious or something

7516.199 --> 7523.839999999999
and just like make you stop

7519.219 --> 7523.84
reinforcing that it's amazing

7525.92 --> 7530.02
it's not literally you don't feel like

7528.08 --> 7532.34
as little voice in your head or anything

7530.02 --> 7535.46
it's just something that happens in

7532.34 --> 7540.28
feelings it's amazing

7535.46 --> 7540.28
but don't worry don't worry too much

7549.38 --> 7556.159000000001
super energy no no no no

7553.219 --> 7558.08
you're not super underachieving nonsense

7556.159 --> 7560.42
dude you've been making some really

7558.08 --> 7563.78
interesting paintwork

7560.42 --> 7568.4
that's not underachieving

7563.78 --> 7571.46
also you're a very good person inspired

7568.4 --> 7574.159
very civil

7571.46 --> 7576.02
dude you're you're great I'm really

7574.159 --> 7578.0599999999995
happy to have you as a follower I mean

7576.02 --> 7581.139
why do you think I keep showing your

7578.06 --> 7581.139
paintings on my show

7581.54 --> 7585.56
I think that's I'm doing that because I

7583.52 --> 7588.46
pity you no that I'm doing that because

7585.56 --> 7588.46
I think you're awesome

7592.46 --> 7597.639
so take it easy with putting yourself in

7595.219 --> 7597.639
a pit

7598.099 --> 7602.360000000001
it's Christmas

7599.48 --> 7604.04
tensions are high might go in all

7602.36 --> 7606.139
directions with it just

7604.04 --> 7609.139
don't take

7606.139 --> 7610.46
your drama that might come outside out

7609.139 --> 7612.43
out of you

7610.46 --> 7616.159
don't take it too serious

7612.43 --> 7618.56
[Music]

7616.159 --> 7620.659
because after Christmas it's gonna die

7618.56 --> 7623.659000000001
down again and you'll feel a lot more

7620.659 --> 7625.879999999999
stable probably I will not that I feel

7623.659 --> 7627.739
particularly unstable but I do have to

7625.88 --> 7629.599
admit that in this time I there is like

7627.739 --> 7631.759999999999
this extra nudge it makes it just

7629.599 --> 7633.860000000001
slightly more difficult and for some

7631.76 --> 7636.860000000001
people that extra Notch might be a

7633.86 --> 7639.739
really big one so it differs per person

7636.86 --> 7642.94
and where they're at in their life and

7639.739 --> 7642.94
in their spiritual journey

7643.04 --> 7646.179
just take it easy

7646.699 --> 7650.98
right also if you feel like this

7651.619 --> 7657.619
you might want to postpone a bit on

7655.04 --> 7659.42
watching that series because that's not

7657.619 --> 7660.98
something you want to watch when you

7659.42 --> 7664.28
actually have

7660.98 --> 7666.32
depression effects don't do that

7664.28 --> 7669.139
you got to be pretty stable to watch it

7666.32 --> 7670.699
it's really [ __ ] scary and if you

7669.139 --> 7673.719
feel miserable

7670.699 --> 7673.719
I wouldn't watch it

7674.78 --> 7680.78
just heed my warning on that

7678.679 --> 7682.6990000000005
wait until you feel better

7680.78 --> 7686.86
okay

7682.699 --> 7686.86
are you gonna be all right why Rhodes

7697.36 --> 7702.139
yeah Rob truth I mean

7700.699 --> 7705.08
dude

7702.139 --> 7708.26
there's bad vibes running ramping

7705.08 --> 7710.659
everywhere outside right

7708.26 --> 7712.820000000001
crazy world

7710.659 --> 7714.5
and yeah during Christmas time tensions

7712.82 --> 7717.38
Run High you become more sensitive

7714.5 --> 7719.239
you're more you're you you panic more

7717.38 --> 7720.4400000000005
easily that's basically what happens you

7719.239 --> 7721.879999999999
just

7720.44 --> 7725.419999999999
have a

7721.88 --> 7727.9400000000005
a lower threshold to panic typically and

7725.42 --> 7730.099
I think on average everybody has that a

7727.94 --> 7731.839999999999
bit at least during Christmas and that's

7730.099 --> 7734.3
why typically at Christmas dinner things

7731.84 --> 7736.46
can get so terribly wrong like out of

7734.3 --> 7738.619000000001
nowhere just things like explode right

7736.46 --> 7741.32
it's because of that

7738.619 --> 7744.679
so just take it easy

7741.32 --> 7747.619
you might panic but if you do don't

7744.679 --> 7750.02
think that's the reality now right

7747.619 --> 7752.38
just let it run its course and just take

7750.02 --> 7752.38
it easy

7752.9 --> 7758.42
before you draw any serious conclusions

7755.239 --> 7761.0599999999995
wait until after Christmas is over

7758.42 --> 7763.46
then carefully think about it again

7761.06 --> 7765.1990000000005
right but on that note I am gonna round

7763.46 --> 7768.28
out the show

7765.199 --> 7768.28
it's been a great show

7769.099 --> 7774.099
and we are right awesome good good okay

7775.639 --> 7780.5
Christmas it can get to yeah that's

7777.739 --> 7783.259999999999
exactly what I meant for you to see that

7780.5 --> 7785.9
just take it easy

7783.26 --> 7788.4800000000005
for a sensitive person

7785.9 --> 7790.5199999999995
you have some issues with anxiety it'll

7788.48 --> 7792.138999999999
get probably get a little bit worse

7790.52 --> 7795.26
during Christmas hopefully not a lot

7792.139 --> 7797.78
just take it easy and just

7795.26 --> 7799.6990000000005
don't think if it goes wrong that that's

7797.78 --> 7801.38
the complete reality now just don't

7799.699 --> 7803.54
overblow it because you will probably

7801.38 --> 7804.56
have the tendency to do it when it

7803.54 --> 7807.199
happens

7804.56 --> 7809.06
just be prepared right just understand

7807.199 --> 7811.219
how things work

7809.06 --> 7813.4400000000005
in these times a year

7811.219 --> 7816.8
so you can deal with it properly and not

7813.44 --> 7820.04
let something stupid and destructive

7816.8 --> 7822.679
roll out of it right so thanks everyone

7892.28 --> 7897.34
right oh yeah and if anybody's

7894.44 --> 7900.799999999999
interested in looking into Christian

7897.34 --> 7903.08
research then I'd really like some more

7900.8 --> 7906.7390000000005
background information

7903.08 --> 7910.699
and yeah digging by any of you guys that

7906.739 --> 7913.638999999999
are listening about how Jesus Christ saw

7910.699 --> 7915.5
the god of the Old Testament right I

7913.639 --> 7917.719
asked that question earlier in the show

7915.5 --> 7920.8
and I think it's kind of an important

7917.719 --> 7920.8
question to think about

7921.139 --> 7927.8
like did he think that was the real God

7924.619 --> 7930.86
or did he think it was the devil a fake

7927.8 --> 7933.1990000000005
God because the actual implications of

7930.86 --> 7935.54
what the real Jesus Christ

7933.199 --> 7937.58
the living man the original one not

7935.54 --> 7939.8
whatever is constructed in this book out

7937.58 --> 7944.0
of him well what he thought about that

7939.8 --> 7944.0
is very significant

7944.239 --> 7951.5599999999995
for the entire Legacy of his teachings

7948.56 --> 7955.96
so I'd like to hear more about that if

7951.56 --> 7955.96
you care to research it anyway

7956.0 --> 7962.179
I'll see you guys on Tuesday Merry

7959.0 --> 7965.02
Christmas and until the next video keep

7962.179 --> 7965.02
it flat

7966.08 --> 7997.35
