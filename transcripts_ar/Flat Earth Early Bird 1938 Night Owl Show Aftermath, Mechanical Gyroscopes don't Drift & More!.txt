297.88 --> 301.639
think it was overall great

306.639 --> 309.16
Mikey

310.199 --> 316.8
Smith oh okay how do you know did he say

313.8 --> 316.8
so on his show or

316.84 --> 319.84
something

322.96 --> 331.71999999999997
AIS like to talk about his images what

327.4 --> 334.23999999999995
images exactly are those but shall you

331.72 --> 338.56
pass him is your my email yeah sure I

334.24 --> 338.56
mean my email is like openly

339.479 --> 343.52
available and if he wants to have a talk

341.68 --> 346.12
or

343.52 --> 349.71999999999997
whatever said white show was great yeah

346.12 --> 350.919
I agree so yeah if he wants to connect

349.72 --> 353.36
up that's

350.919 --> 355.79999999999995
cool I mean the best way to do it though

353.36 --> 357.759
is over Skype because I would definitely

355.8 --> 360.759
love to like have a one-on-one

357.759 --> 360.759

362.68 --> 366.84000000000003
to basically get to know him a little

371.24 --> 377.08
bit right I mean people that I don't

374.24 --> 381.479

show like go live I mean without really

381.479 --> 387.639
knowing

387.639 --> 393.919
yeah I would prefer to like get to talk

390.12 --> 396.12
to him sort of face to face or at least

393.919 --> 398.79999999999995

698.8 --> 702.5999999999999
flat earthers and I don't want to have

700.56 --> 706.6389999999999

you I don't like it when people say

747.519 --> 753.5600000000001
they're acquainted in anyway and I have

750.279 --> 753.56
no idea who the hell they

759.48 --> 769.8000000000001

769.8 --> 773.4799999999999
my chat like I'm not going to have him

771.76 --> 777.68
on as a

773.48 --> 781.12
guest like he's just going to act Goofy

777.68 --> 781.12
and talk about nonsense

781.72 --> 786.72
try to manipulate me in all kinds of

784.639 --> 789.04
directions and all that and like I'm not

786.72 --> 789.0400000000001
having

791.56 --> 797.279
that he's an anti flat earther I'm not

794.199 --> 801.199
having him on he's lucky enough that I

797.279 --> 801.199
allow him in my chat

807.16 --> 810.789
[Music]

818.079 --> 823.04
it might be no no it won't be

842.48 --> 847.639
right

844.199 --> 849.68
unless he can basically tell me exactly

847.639 --> 852.24
what he's going to talk about and then

849.68 --> 852.2399999999999
stick to

854.48 --> 858.72
that then maybe I

859.399 --> 863.6
mean you really if you want something

862.079 --> 865.6389999999999
serious then

863.6 --> 869.48

865.639 --> 871.9590000000001
can pick up contact on Skype with me and

869.48 --> 873.1990000000001
and that's about it and yeah then we'll

871.959 --> 876.0
see what

873.199 --> 879.0
happens but uh I'm not particularly

876.0 --> 879.0

943.0 --> 948.639
enthusiastic about me potentially

945.319 --> 951.8389999999999

948.639 --> 954.0790000000001

958.24 --> 964.639
baiting from you you guys I'm sick of

961.639 --> 967.519
it if that's all you're here for to try

964.639 --> 972.319
to graft me into some anti Flat Earth or

967.519 --> 972.319
circuit then get the [ __ ] out of my

973.199 --> 977.56
chat you got it

979.58 --> 986.5200000000001
[Music]

991.759 --> 997.5600000000001
yeah your definition of friendly Gary f

994.839 --> 1001.8000000000001
is uh not shared I don't think that's

997.56 --> 1001.8
friendly I think he's annoying

1025.12 --> 1030.28
now any Flat Earth out

1028.0 --> 1033.88
there that's a different matter if

1030.28 --> 1036.8799999999999
somebody wants to get on talk about

1033.88 --> 1038.7990000000002
their activities on Flat Earth in their

1036.88 --> 1043.64
Channel and all that I'd love to have a

1038.799 --> 1043.6399999999999
conversation about that it'll be

1047.0 --> 1053.679
fine right I mean I'm still kind of

1050.24 --> 1056.52
waiting for qn Fe

1053.679 --> 1059.48
to kind of pick up back contact I don't

1056.52 --> 1062.08
know why like a while back he kind of

1059.48 --> 1064.1200000000001
said hello and all that and when I was

1062.08 --> 1066.3999999999999
in a bad spot he was kind of being nice

1064.12 --> 1069.039
but he just

1066.4 --> 1071.3200000000002
completely dropped all contact ever

1069.039 --> 1073.6
since just kind of a shame I I thought

1071.32 --> 1076.6
that maybe I could get him on he has

1073.6 --> 1080.84
interesting subjects he talks

1076.6 --> 1080.84
about but uh

1083.039 --> 1088.64
yeah I I guess he's like too busy or

1085.6 --> 1088.6399999999999
something I don't know what it

1107.48 --> 1114.84
is all right

1110.52 --> 1117.96
ow Benjamin yesterday rounded out Boomer

1125.24 --> 1130.559

1128.96 --> 1133.96
of emotional

1130.559 --> 1133.96
and but

1134.36 --> 1142.9189999999999

contact them and ask them

1391.799 --> 1398.36
over if there's any

1395.2 --> 1400.48

1398.36 --> 1404.6789999999999
though that I don't really follow that

1400.48 --> 1404.679
many different channels all that

1406.72 --> 1413.0
closely I stick to mostly a few channels

1410.039 --> 1416.1589999999999
that I like to

1413.0 --> 1418.4
follow uh it's not all even flat earth

1416.159 --> 1421.279
related that

1418.4 --> 1425.52
much cuz I mean most people talking

1421.279 --> 1425.52
about Flat Earth they're

1428.08 --> 1433.76
like talking about it in a way where I'm

1431.44 --> 1438.96
like already past that

1433.76 --> 1438.96

1488.76 --> 1493.84
attention and then we'll see from there

1491.399 --> 1497.2399999999998
I mean who

1493.84 --> 1500.32
knows I'll eventually end up having on

1497.24 --> 1500.32
my show

1518.88 --> 1522.3200000000002
sorry you don't have to say sorry it's

1520.88 --> 1526.96
all

1522.32 --> 1528.399
fine didn't say anything to reprimand

1526.96 --> 1531.679
you or anything I don't know what you're

1528.399 --> 1532.84
saying sorry for Steven Jarvis I me you

1531.679 --> 1536.72
have a good

1532.84 --> 1539.72
point it's just like I said I don't I'm

1536.72 --> 1544.1200000000001
not really all that familiar with the

1539.72 --> 1546.96
scene like every who's doing what out

1544.12 --> 1548.799
there I mean I know there's technically

1546.96 --> 1550.32
like hundreds of YouTubers out there

1548.799 --> 1554.1589999999999
doing all kinds of

1550.32 --> 1554.1589999999999
things with varying

1554.48 --> 1561.159
qualities most of which really I don't

1557.399 --> 1564.559
really follow because it's just not

1561.159 --> 1568.1200000000001
riveting it's not something that I feel

1564.559 --> 1570.44
particularly inspired by so and I don't

1568.12 --> 1573.2399999999998
know man that might be

1570.44 --> 1577.3200000000002
mutual there's a lot of a dead air on

1573.24 --> 1579.84
the early bird show and and all that but

1577.32 --> 1582.32
I mean it's a live interactive show with

1579.84 --> 1584.8799999999999
the chat so it's to be

1582.32 --> 1589.399
expected the really interesting thing

1584.88 --> 1593.24
things do happen when interesting people

1589.399 --> 1596.279
get in my chat and bring up good points

1593.24 --> 1599.84
that are inspiring

1596.279 --> 1601.76
that inspire me and then we have

1599.84 --> 1604.6
conversations about it that that's

1601.76 --> 1604.6
that's how the show

1608.88 --> 1615.72
Works saying good things about the lat

1611.44 --> 1620.24
I'll show it's not the late owl show aiz

1615.72 --> 1620.24
it's the night owl show

1624.48 --> 1630.799
yeah I mean c can you actually

1627.6 --> 1633.12
read it doesn't say late owl show it

1630.799 --> 1636.12
says Night Owl

1633.12 --> 1636.12
show

1644.6 --> 1651.7199999999998
yeah but yeah I mean I guess I'm getting

1648.2 --> 1653.96
compliments over my night owl shows and

1651.72 --> 1656.24
I like it I mean I'm very happy with the

1653.96 --> 1660.519
night owl show how is how it's been

1656.24 --> 1663.6
going and I'd like to continue that

1660.519 --> 1666.519
Trend and hey other people are

1663.6 --> 1671.08
enthusiastic about it want to give it a

1666.519 --> 1676.159
go I'm right here contact me through my

1671.08 --> 1680.0
email and through Skype and

1676.159 --> 1684.0800000000002
yeah maybe you Tobe could get on with me

1680.0 --> 1684.08
on the night owl show

1690.88 --> 1695.24
Absolutely it's kind of funny too

1693.0 --> 1699.039
because that's how the Night Out Show

1695.24 --> 1701.1200000000001
always was intended not as a daily thing

1699.039 --> 1702.519
like the Flat Earth early bird show but

1701.12 --> 1707.7199999999998
as a show

1702.519 --> 1707.72
where special guests can come on

1712.2 --> 1719.8400000000001
okay yeah man

1714.72 --> 1719.84
LS stop it yeah I know what you're

1730.279 --> 1736.08
doing yeah night Al show does not have a

1733.919 --> 1741.0
standard

1736.08 --> 1744.12
time it's not a daily show that is on

1741.0 --> 1745.48
every every day at the same time it's

1744.12 --> 1748.399
not like

1745.48 --> 1749.76
that yeah every night I'll show is

1748.399 --> 1752.12
uniquely

1749.76 --> 1754.72
planned I mean and that's kind of good

1752.12 --> 1757.399
when I have guests on I yeah I kind of

1754.72 --> 1760.0
have to adapt to their available time

1757.399 --> 1763.12
schedule so I can't just say oh it's

1760.0 --> 1764.88
always at this time no it isn't that's

1763.12 --> 1768.8799999999999
not how that show

1764.88 --> 1768.88
is so

1769.0 --> 1775.64
you don't need to ask and don't call it

1772.32 --> 1778.96
the late [ __ ] owl show it's the night

1775.64 --> 1781.76
owl show anybody else going to say late

1778.96 --> 1783.8400000000001
owl show and not Night Owl show which is

1781.76 --> 1785.799
the name of the show I will ban you the

1783.84 --> 1787.72
next

1785.799 --> 1794.76
time I'm

1787.72 --> 1794.76
done with this annoying [ __ ] stop it

1819.24 --> 1826.799
right all new ideas take time to grow

1823.279 --> 1826.799
yeah that's just

1826.96 --> 1830.96
fine for

1873.74 --> 1877.759
[Music]

1880.76 --> 1885.1589999999999
hey fibs good to see you

1885.64 --> 1890.6000000000001
[Music]

1888.08 --> 1893.6599999999999
how you doing today how how did the

1890.6 --> 1895.279
uh job interview and and all that

1893.66 --> 1900.24
[Music]

1895.279 --> 1900.24
go hope everything worked out

1932.59 --> 1935.6999999999998
[Music]

1945.2 --> 1948.519
oh okay

1949.2 --> 1953.0800000000002
right yeah wish you the best of luck I

1950.6 --> 1953.08
hope you get

1960.2 --> 1965.96
it right night I show again yeah no I'm

1963.6 --> 1967.84
very happy about yesterday's show I

1965.96 --> 1970.2
haven't actually watched it back yet but

1967.84 --> 1975.08
I mean the whole thing felt good and was

1970.2 --> 1978.6390000000001
really fluid and even at the end

1975.08 --> 1983.12
amicable yeah and at the end like even

1978.639 --> 1983.12
they've sort of like Tred to bring up

1983.76 --> 1991.1589999999999
issues like with fed and all that and I

1986.96 --> 1995.3990000000001
really I think I mitigated that pretty

1991.159 --> 1998.519
well to have a neutral honest vantage

1995.399 --> 2000.32
point and thereby fulfilling a

1998.519 --> 2003.039
diplomatic function at it and that's

2000.32 --> 2006.08
kind of what I wanted to do when I want

2003.039 --> 2009.44
to keep doing like I'm not part of fed

2006.08 --> 2012.12
anymore I really am not

2009.44 --> 2015.519
I mean I'm I will still join ball

2012.12 --> 2016.76
busters as long as Qi like is acceptant

2015.519 --> 2020.36
of

2016.76 --> 2023.76
me right and when the subject is

2020.36 --> 2026.399
interesting or somehow I'm yeah I'm

2023.76 --> 2029.2
interested but I'm not part of fed

2026.399 --> 2031.039
anymore and I definitely do not ascribe

2029.2 --> 2035.8400000000001
to their overall

2031.039 --> 2035.84
policies but I will listen to their

2035.919 --> 2041.6390000000001
argumentation and I

2038.679 --> 2044.2
will on the side and I don't know if

2041.639 --> 2047.0
they want this or not I don't really

2044.2 --> 2049.639
care I do it because I think it's

2047.0 --> 2052.44
necessary and I will try to mitigate

2049.639 --> 2054.7200000000003
any friction or

2052.44 --> 2058.359
misunderstanding that

2054.72 --> 2061.399
may may be happening out

2058.359 --> 2065.0
there because

2061.399 --> 2067.159
yeah I want the whole Flat Earth scene

2065.0 --> 2068.879
kind of like how Patricia ster wanted it

2067.159 --> 2071.96
I wanted to

2068.879 --> 2074.359
stick together and get over the

2071.96 --> 2077.96
differences and just move

2074.359 --> 2077.96
forward with the best

2079.0 --> 2083.839
arguments and that's what I tried to

2081.48 --> 2088.8
communicate yesterday with Dave

2083.839 --> 2091.599
Weiss and I think that that was received

2088.8 --> 2094.32
well that was agreed upon and like

2091.599 --> 2097.2400000000002
that's important I mean

2094.32 --> 2099.119
fed over there nobody's going to do that

2097.24 --> 2100.64
they're just going to do what they

2099.119 --> 2103.839
always

2100.64 --> 2106.2799999999997
do and be extremely Unapologetic about

2103.839 --> 2107.96
it and that's their own prerogative I

2106.28 --> 2111.119
mean I'm not going to say oh how dare

2107.96 --> 2114.4
you you're doing that wrong it's just

2111.119 --> 2118.839
that there's problems with

2114.4 --> 2122.359
that and I'm on the sidelines and I can

2118.839 --> 2127.72
help mitigate those problems

2122.359 --> 2127.72
to basically smooth things out

2128.52 --> 2134.88
and that's what I want to

2130.8 --> 2137.88
do because I can and so I will do

2134.88 --> 2141.1600000000003
that and then hopefully at some

2137.88 --> 2142.96
point yeah things could just work more

2141.16 --> 2144.56
smoothly and then the whole scene is

2142.96 --> 2147.76
more

2144.56 --> 2150.7999999999997
unified maybe or maybe not but I could

2147.76 --> 2154.92
at least like just prevent

2150.8 --> 2158.92
unnecessary infighting waste of

2154.92 --> 2158.92
energy right

2161.48 --> 2165.079
if if that sort of thing ever comes

2173.48 --> 2181.92
up since you sto watching F so much to

2177.359 --> 2181.92
be fair what what does that mean

2194.96 --> 2201.119
the inviting doesn't seem to exist

2197.8 --> 2201.119
exactly what does that

2213.8 --> 2217.8
mean then

2223.4 --> 2229.2000000000003
could you why are you splitting up that

2226.56 --> 2229.2
sentence

2236.359 --> 2240.7999999999997
fbrs but if you're saying that fed

2239.64 --> 2244.7999999999997
causes

2240.8 --> 2249.119
infighting uh yeah yes it

2244.8 --> 2249.119
does that's correct

2256.16 --> 2263.839
they do and nobody stops

2260.0 --> 2265.88
it and I don't want to be part of that

2263.839 --> 2267.4
it is part of the reason why I'm not

2265.88 --> 2271.2400000000002
going back

2267.4 --> 2273.04
there cuz it is toxic and it is palpably

2271.24 --> 2275.8799999999997
toxic on me I

2273.04 --> 2278.96
mean even on ball busters it's like yeah

2275.88 --> 2282.88
it's all cool and anal and fun and games

2278.96 --> 2285.64
and like silly name calling over saying

2282.88 --> 2288.319
stupid things when representing Flat

2285.64 --> 2289.8799999999997
Earth I get that but then at some point

2288.319 --> 2292.96
like it'll go too

2289.88 --> 2293.92
far and then I don't want to be part of

2292.96 --> 2296.079
that

2293.92 --> 2299.96
anymore so I'll just stick to the

2296.079 --> 2302.319
background or leave and that's how I do

2299.96 --> 2302.319
things

2302.68 --> 2308.24
now that's how it's going to be and like

2305.599 --> 2312.48
I don't care either way I don't care

2308.24 --> 2312.4799999999996
what they think of that that they do

2312.52 --> 2318.4
that right if if they're going to for

2315.0 --> 2320.8
some reason exclude

2318.4 --> 2323.28
me then that's their prerogative and

2320.8 --> 2325.8
then okay well I'll be excluded then

2323.28 --> 2327.76
then you won't have me around and I have

2325.8 --> 2331.2000000000003
to deal with more people that are saying

2327.76 --> 2332.6800000000003
like oh why isn't Arwin on we used to

2331.2 --> 2336.7999999999997
like

2332.68 --> 2338.64
that yeah and it's not my problem like I

2336.8 --> 2341.0
have my own sh show here this is what I

2338.64 --> 2344.839
do I do it my

2341.0 --> 2348.119
way I have my own objectives my own own

2344.839 --> 2352.24
cone code of conduct and I'm sticking to

2348.119 --> 2354.359
that and I'm not adapting to another

2352.24 --> 2357.56
code of

2354.359 --> 2358.839
conduct I'm not doing that anymore and

2357.56 --> 2362.24
that's

2358.839 --> 2366.16
permanent like I I will

2362.24 --> 2368.839
never undo that

2366.16 --> 2371.48
ever yeah even if that means that I'll

2368.839 --> 2374.4
be more obscure and and in a corner more

2371.48 --> 2376.56
than ever I don't care then I'll be more

2374.4 --> 2380.56
obscure than ever in in the corner but

2376.56 --> 2384.48
I'm not going to adapt back to the way

2380.56 --> 2389.0789999999997
things were at fed I will never do that

2384.48 --> 2392.16
ever CU I literally became ill over that

2389.079 --> 2394.7200000000003
physically ill with some serious side

2392.16 --> 2398.7999999999997
effects mentally and I'm not going

2394.72 --> 2398.7999999999997
through that again ever again

2399.0 --> 2405.319
yeah and if that somehow makes it

2400.88 --> 2405.319
intolerable for people well that's fine

2405.839 --> 2411.48
then you can push me out even further

2409.28 --> 2414.52
and have all contact lost all

2411.48 --> 2417.88
associations lost all that that's all

2414.52 --> 2419.92
fine I don't care either way but I'm not

2417.88 --> 2423.0
going to adapt back to the way things

2419.92 --> 2425.56
were it's not going to

2423.0 --> 2428.599
happen yeah because it made me

2425.56 --> 2431.52
physically ill

2428.599 --> 2433.599
like and not at a as a temporary State

2431.52 --> 2435.7599999999998
as a permanent influence and I'm not

2433.599 --> 2439.48
doing that

2435.76 --> 2443.119
anymore I have to move on with my life I

2439.48 --> 2447.2400000000002
in all that time I really was on the

2443.119 --> 2449.8
side like I want to progress with my

2447.24 --> 2453.0
life and not just be stuck in this room

2449.8 --> 2456.8
being a participant of that

2453.0 --> 2460.48
show but that was happening and I didn't

2456.8 --> 2460.48
financi climb out of my

2460.56 --> 2467.88
situation and I even like begged and

2464.44 --> 2469.2400000000002
pleaded for assistance in that and I

2467.88 --> 2473.44
didn't get

2469.24 --> 2476.4399999999996
it barely I got some

2473.44 --> 2478.96
emergency help like when my computer was

2476.44 --> 2481.16
broken and and yeah I did get some help

2478.96 --> 2483.76
with that through the community and

2481.16 --> 2483.7599999999998
that's about

2485.119 --> 2493.1600000000003
it right and hey it's it's been good in

2489.839 --> 2496.319
other ways I mean especially adamin

2493.16 --> 2499.52
helped me a lot with like the format of

2496.319 --> 2501.4
my show and figuring out OBS and I'm

2499.52 --> 2503.599
really thankful for him for that for

2501.4 --> 2503.599
that

2506.92 --> 2513.56
assistance but uh yeah I mean I'm I'm

2510.839 --> 2513.56
all good

2514.04 --> 2519.56
now and I'm confident enough that I'll

2516.96 --> 2522.76
be able able to figure out any other

2519.56 --> 2525.599
changes I would like to

2522.76 --> 2528.1600000000003
make in the future although yeah I'm not

2525.599 --> 2530.599
very much about changing the format

2528.16 --> 2534.68
because I like to keep things the way

2530.599 --> 2534.6800000000003
they are I don't really like change

2535.0 --> 2541.16
anyway and I'm satisfied with this

2537.359 --> 2544.24
format and if I want to change it around

2541.16 --> 2546.1189999999997
then I just will I will then change it

2544.24 --> 2549.1189999999997
around and I'll be able to do that just

2546.119 --> 2549.119
fine on my own

2550.599 --> 2557.079
right so you can't control me you can't

2553.16 --> 2558.2
try to Blackmail me into going against

2557.079 --> 2562.6400000000003
my own

2558.2 --> 2564.24
will because I supposedly need somebody

2562.64 --> 2567.16
like it's not going to happen I will

2564.24 --> 2569.52
continue on doing what I do the way that

2567.16 --> 2572.839
I do it

2569.52 --> 2575.44
and you can be friendly you can be

2572.839 --> 2578.48
helpful you can be distant you can be

2575.44 --> 2583.48
hostile it doesn't matter

2578.48 --> 2583.48
I will do what I do and I will do it my

2603.04 --> 2609.119
way okay I don't exactly know what you

2605.44 --> 2609.119
mean fiber out but I mean

2610.2 --> 2616.2799999999997
yeah and as a listener to a show like

2614.4 --> 2618.48
you can always just tune out without

2616.28 --> 2620.92
anybody taking notice of that or

2618.48 --> 2625.16
anything but when you're actually part

2620.92 --> 2627.119
of the show you're on there like that is

2625.16 --> 2630.0
like a spotlight on

2627.119 --> 2633.2400000000002
you you can't just slip

2630.0 --> 2636.8
out without everybody noticing

2633.24 --> 2639.0789999999997
it and this is weird expectations it's

2636.8 --> 2641.52
like no you have to stay in line like

2639.079 --> 2647.559
it's some kind of soldiery or something

2641.52 --> 2650.119
and like no I'm just not doing it

2647.559 --> 2654.3190000000004
anymore I don't like the way they do

2650.119 --> 2654.319
things and I don't want to be part of

2657.64 --> 2664.0789999999997
that I like QE

2660.52 --> 2666.24
shows I think it's funny is reviewing

2664.079 --> 2667.96
especially of anti flat earthers or flat

2666.24 --> 2669.4399999999996
earthers messing up I think that's funny

2667.96 --> 2671.88
and a whole bunch of people out there

2669.44 --> 2675.4
don't think it's funny and they like

2671.88 --> 2677.8
David White seems to feel it's really

2675.4 --> 2680.1600000000003
objectionable when we go after a flat

2677.8 --> 2684.2000000000003
Earth or even when they just palpably

2680.16 --> 2687.72
provably mess up yeah well I I get it I

2684.2 --> 2692.3999999999996
get that you don't like that but I

2687.72 --> 2697.4399999999996
mean who cares it's what they

2692.4 --> 2699.0
do criticism is important

2697.44 --> 2702.04
and

2699.0 --> 2704.16
like Flat Earth shouldn't be like some

2702.04 --> 2706.52
priesthood it's like oh you're a flat

2704.16 --> 2709.2799999999997
earther so it doesn't really matter if

2706.52 --> 2711.359
you mess up like don't criticize like no

2709.28 --> 2714.119
no everybody needs

2711.359 --> 2716.96
criticism constructive

2714.119 --> 2719.48
criticism and needs to be pointed at

2716.96 --> 2721.119
when they mess up how they mess up

2719.48 --> 2724.119
because that's giving them an

2721.119 --> 2727.1600000000003
opportunity to improve and if your

2724.119 --> 2732.1600000000003
feelings get in the way of being being

2727.16 --> 2734.7599999999998
able to improve well then that is your

2732.16 --> 2737.64
problem and not somebody making a

2734.76 --> 2740.6400000000003
critical video about

2737.64 --> 2740.64
you

2746.16 --> 2754.96
right so everybody has directions that

2750.72 --> 2758.72
they can grow in and learn instead of

2754.96 --> 2760.76
just bracing yourself against the ways

2758.72 --> 2762.9599999999996
other people do things that you don't

2760.76 --> 2762.96
like

2763.0 --> 2768.44
it it's pointless it's pointless to do

2765.8 --> 2770.44
that nobody progresses when you do

2768.44 --> 2773.48
that

2770.44 --> 2776.68
and hey I can't stop you but I I can

2773.48 --> 2781.359
tell you I can tell you how that

2776.68 --> 2784.48
works and give you pointers as to how

2781.359 --> 2787.7999999999997
to find a way

2784.48 --> 2789.96
through find a better way through

2787.8 --> 2792.48
instead of just making the same types of

2789.96 --> 2796.359
mistakes over and over

2792.48 --> 2798.839
again right but that only works when

2796.359 --> 2802.24
people are willing to listen and and

2798.839 --> 2804.96
take such advice to

2802.24 --> 2806.8799999999997
Heart right and I can't force anybody to

2804.96 --> 2810.28
take any advice to

2806.88 --> 2815.6800000000003
Heart can only tell them and hope that

2810.28 --> 2815.6800000000003
they'll pick up on it that's it

2820.34 --> 2823.55
[Music]

2842.72 --> 2848.839
right let's put that in the title for

2844.52 --> 2848.839
now nightall show aftermath

2849.52 --> 2853.0
we are sort of talking about

2856.96 --> 2861.44
that F was pretty important for you now

2860.119 --> 2868.319
it just

2861.44 --> 2868.319
isn't okay well I kind of feel the same

2881.119 --> 2885.559
again I mean I've not been on there for

2884.24 --> 2888.7599999999998
like three

2885.559 --> 2891.8390000000004
months and I'm not missing

2888.76 --> 2894.92
it I'm very satisfied with just doing my

2891.839 --> 2897.16
own show I think that even my own show

2894.92 --> 2900.559
overall is doing way

2897.16 --> 2903.64
better my View kind has gone up

2900.559 --> 2906.6400000000003
dramatically and has stayed up ever

2903.64 --> 2906.64
since

2909.0 --> 2914.88
and now it's kind of rare that I have a

2911.88 --> 2917.839
show in which like really nothing

2914.88 --> 2921.44
happens it's

2917.839 --> 2925.16
rare like not always in a good mood but

2921.44 --> 2925.16
there's always something that

2927.44 --> 2932.2000000000003
happens right and hey I'm I'm still

2930.359 --> 2934.839
using the

2932.2 --> 2937.3999999999996
argumentation I mean I might not be as

2934.839 --> 2940.4
super fluent at it

2937.4 --> 2942.64
and disciplined as as Nathan Oakley is I

2940.4 --> 2946.599
mean he is the master of that type of

2942.64 --> 2949.5589999999997
reasoning and debating he is and he will

2946.599 --> 2953.559
retain that status as far as I'm

2949.559 --> 2955.88
concerned but I don't want to be Nathan

2953.559 --> 2959.4
Oakley 2

2955.88 --> 2962.04
2.0 I just want to take the good

2959.4 --> 2963.6800000000003
arguments to Heart realize what they are

2962.04 --> 2966.44
and their

2963.68 --> 2968.8799999999997
value try to communicate them to other

2966.44 --> 2970.48
people people in a way that it might be

2968.88 --> 2972.4
a little bit more palatable that they'll

2970.48 --> 2974.2400000000002
be more understanding of the actual

2972.4 --> 2979.52
value of it instead of getting hung up

2974.24 --> 2979.52
on the format on the way it's

2980.16 --> 2985.8799999999997
represented and that way the value can

2983.4 --> 2989.28
spread out I mean that's officially even

2985.88 --> 2991.559
one of Nathan Ole's objectives about it

2989.28 --> 2994.3590000000004
it's like just take our arguments just

2991.559 --> 2995.8390000000004
use them against the Ballers like and I

2994.359 --> 2998.64
agree with that I think that's a good

2995.839 --> 2998.64
objective

2998.92 --> 3004.52
but yeah format does matter and it

3001.88 --> 3006.88
doesn't seem like the format's really

3004.52 --> 3006.88
going to

3007.559 --> 3013.76
change I mean officially there might be

3010.44 --> 3015.28
like a different attitude or whatever or

3013.76 --> 3018.0
different

3015.28 --> 3020.559
directions but it's still grounded in

3018.0 --> 3020.559
the same

3021.44 --> 3027.839
ground with the same backdrop feelings

3024.4 --> 3027.839
and all that

3030.96 --> 3036.04
and the same type of

3032.68 --> 3038.2799999999997
bickery and so that doesn't seem to be

3036.04 --> 3042.16
capable of really changing it seems to

3038.28 --> 3042.1600000000003
be just part of how they

3042.2 --> 3047.2799999999997
are and I don't feel like there anything

3044.76 --> 3050.28
can be done about that

3047.28 --> 3053.799
like it's grown like this it's not going

3050.28 --> 3053.799
to grow

3053.92 --> 3059.599
differently but hey the fruits are still

3057.28 --> 3060.92
valuable though kind of bitter at times

3059.599 --> 3064.0
they're still

3060.92 --> 3067.0
valuable and so I'm just kind of trying

3064.0 --> 3067.0
to be a guarder

3067.44 --> 3072.76
here and

3069.88 --> 3075.52
just be an

3072.76 --> 3077.48
intermittent figure a diplomat that can

3075.52 --> 3080.319
just like yeah there is value in that

3077.48 --> 3082.68
you just just try to see past the whole

3080.319 --> 3085.72
feeling objections

3082.68 --> 3087.799
part and just and just listen to the

3085.72 --> 3088.68
technical side of I mean it is well

3087.799 --> 3092.52
thought

3088.68 --> 3098.0
out and it is valuable

3092.52 --> 3101.24
and I can even help drain Outsiders

3098.0 --> 3103.68
potentially to deal with it

3101.24 --> 3106.7599999999998
psychologically more

3103.68 --> 3109.5989999999997
efficient like I can technically help

3106.76 --> 3111.599
train people like how to deal with anti

3109.599 --> 3117.28
flat earthers and what they

3111.599 --> 3117.28
say I've had so much training for that

3118.799 --> 3126.119
that I don't want to do it personally I

3121.68 --> 3129.04
really don't but other people do and

3126.119 --> 3135.44
they get stuck they get stuck in certain

3129.04 --> 3135.44
types of things and I can help you with

3138.799 --> 3148.28
that I can help you train for that so

3143.44 --> 3151.119
that you're better prepared with better

3148.28 --> 3154.76
anticipations better

3151.119 --> 3157.0
responses I can help you with that you

3154.76 --> 3159.119
want to talk about it publicly that's

3157.0 --> 3162.359
fine you want to talk about it privately

3159.119 --> 3164.079
that's very understandable and I will

3162.359 --> 3165.839
accommodate yeah you want to talk about

3164.079 --> 3168.8390000000004
that sort of thing

3165.839 --> 3171.2
privately contact me on Skype or through

3168.839 --> 3173.52
email or

3171.2 --> 3175.04
both and we can have a conversation

3173.52 --> 3178.04
about such

3175.04 --> 3181.079
things I've had plenty of conversation

3178.04 --> 3181.079
about such things with

3181.16 --> 3186.319
people yeah and don't if you contact me

3184.839 --> 3190.119
and you do that kind of thing I do keep

3186.319 --> 3192.88
it private like you don't want to be

3190.119 --> 3195.119
known to the outside

3192.88 --> 3197.52
world to even be having such

3195.119 --> 3200.92
conversation with me that's perfectly

3197.52 --> 3204.839
fine I will keep it private then like I

3200.92 --> 3206.88
don't need to brag about my social

3204.839 --> 3210.2799999999997
interactions that kind of like

3206.88 --> 3211.96
compensate for my shortcomings in my

3210.28 --> 3215.3190000000004
social

3211.96 --> 3218.799
life yeah like I am a

3215.319 --> 3221.64
Hermit and I'm okay with it I mean I

3218.799 --> 3225.16
don't want to stay a Hermit

3221.64 --> 3229.48
forever there are things that I yearn

3225.16 --> 3229.48
for to have in my life at some

3230.04 --> 3234.24
point but I'm not so desperate that I'm

3233.2 --> 3237.359
going to

3234.24 --> 3242.1189999999997
like brag

3237.359 --> 3242.119
just to try to feel okay with

3243.559 --> 3247.799
myself right hey LSG good to see

3254.76 --> 3261.6400000000003
you right and I am ready for

3257.96 --> 3263.88
contact even with like really new flat

3261.64 --> 3267.72
earthers realize though that if you're

3263.88 --> 3269.96
like relatively new flat earther this is

3267.72 --> 3272.9599999999996
a show that's been going on for a very

3269.96 --> 3275.2
long time and I have a lot of trolls and

3272.96 --> 3278.88
anti flat ears that like to hang around

3275.2 --> 3282.4399999999996
and leech on me and especially on on new

3278.88 --> 3286.599
people that get in here so be

3282.44 --> 3290.0
wary it's kind of a jungle out here the

3286.599 --> 3292.6800000000003
safest way to just have amicable contact

3290.0 --> 3295.68
without risking getting trolled all over

3292.68 --> 3300.0789999999997
you is by contacting me on Skype

3295.68 --> 3300.0789999999997
privately that is the the safest

3308.48 --> 3315.76
way I mean like even David Weiss when I

3313.52 --> 3318.799
basically shared that I was going to

3315.76 --> 3322.1600000000003
have a show with him like he immediately

3318.799 --> 3324.599
got spammed with trolls like threatening

3322.16 --> 3328.799
and all that threatening him not to have

3324.599 --> 3333.319
me on Etc so that just

3328.799 --> 3337.0
happens I can't stop it can't stop those

3333.319 --> 3337.0
people I would if I

3339.599 --> 3346.079
could so but I mean yeah you're a new

3343.359 --> 3348.7599999999998
flat earther you want to you want to

3346.079 --> 3351.92
meet me in person right I

3348.76 --> 3354.599
mean that's cool I'm I'm good for that

3351.92 --> 3357.599
as well you can meet me in private it's

3354.599 --> 3360.48
been done in the past Dutch

3357.599 --> 3363.44
and me met up here in utra plenty of

3360.48 --> 3367.44
times before something like got in the

3363.44 --> 3367.44
way of that

3369.4 --> 3374.1600000000003
connection I don't think he really likes

3371.559 --> 3378.1600000000003
me anymore I said some things that he

3374.16 --> 3378.16
just like couldn't get

3378.44 --> 3383.68
over but I mean

3381.16 --> 3386.3999999999996
yeah there's plenty of flat earthers

3383.68 --> 3391.52
here in the Netherlands especially like

3386.4 --> 3393.6800000000003
that that's what the Dave's app showed

3391.52 --> 3396.68
Flat Earth app that there is like tons

3393.68 --> 3400.16
of the Dutch Flat earthers that are part

3396.68 --> 3402.3999999999996
of his app so yeah

3400.16 --> 3404.7599999999998
hey I'm

3402.4 --> 3406.48
here you want to contact me you want to

3404.76 --> 3408.599
meet up you want to have a drink or

3406.48 --> 3411.52
something you want to just talk about

3408.599 --> 3413.0
Flat Earth you want to maybe carefully

3411.52 --> 3416.799
build up

3413.0 --> 3420.359
to to appear on my show or something or

3416.799 --> 3420.359
you want me to appear on your

3420.559 --> 3427.1600000000003
show I'm here I for now I got pretty

3424.96 --> 3429.359
much all the time in the

3427.16 --> 3431.5989999999997
world I don't know how long that's going

3429.359 --> 3431.5989999999997
to

3432.2 --> 3440.799
last cuz on the long run I am kind of

3436.44 --> 3442.799
planning to phase out the early bir show

3440.799 --> 3446.799
don't know exactly how or when that's

3442.799 --> 3449.24
going to happen and try to get uh

3446.799 --> 3452.559
surprise surprise at some kind of a job

3449.24 --> 3455.16
situation or a combination of jobs to

3452.559 --> 3458.799
actually get me out of this financial

3455.16 --> 3462.24
ditch which I have been in for quite a

3458.799 --> 3466.079
while and there

3462.24 --> 3467.839
is like the job market is favorable in

3466.079 --> 3470.599
that sense that there is a worker

3467.839 --> 3474.7599999999998
shortage and I am going to try to use

3470.599 --> 3478.839
that worker shortage to see if I

3474.76 --> 3478.8390000000004
can get my my way in

3480.68 --> 3485.5989999999997
better and then perhaps from that

3483.48 --> 3489.92
Vantage

3485.599 --> 3489.92
Point Revitalize

3490.4 --> 3494.92
my my clothing and and and maybe even

3493.96 --> 3497.0
some

3494.92 --> 3499.599
equipment and

3497.0 --> 3501.119
just have it all work

3499.599 --> 3503.7200000000003
better

3501.119 --> 3506.92
and

3503.72 --> 3510.72
yeah move on

3506.92 --> 3513.7200000000003
Advance hey clutch good to see

3510.72 --> 3517.8799999999997
you right but I mean for now the there's

3513.72 --> 3517.8799999999997
flatter of early bir show is going to

3517.92 --> 3523.7200000000003
persist I mean when it's going to change

3520.559 --> 3526.3590000000004
around I'll I'll be here to tell you

3523.72 --> 3528.7599999999998
just saying that I have this plan

3526.359 --> 3530.319
because I can't just say like no I'm

3528.76 --> 3531.76
going to do the Flat Earth early bir

3530.319 --> 3534.4
show

3531.76 --> 3537.6400000000003
forever and because that would mean I'd

3534.4 --> 3540.559
be stuck forever unless I'd get get like

3537.64 --> 3544.1189999999997
massive support all of a sudden unless

3540.559 --> 3546.92
there's like more than say 10 people

3544.119 --> 3548.52
that periodically like to support me

3546.92 --> 3551.2000000000003
financially for my

3548.52 --> 3554.16
efforts if that number

3551.2 --> 3555.839
grew I've got new people who would be

3554.16 --> 3559.24
willing to help me

3555.839 --> 3561.72
out well yeah I mean if the support

3559.24 --> 3564.799
increases My overall opportunities

3561.72 --> 3567.319
increase and my mood my mood will be way

3564.799 --> 3570.799
better I will be less

3567.319 --> 3572.92
cranky I will be better at dealing with

3570.799 --> 3572.92
the

3573.24 --> 3576.4799999999996
trolls and

3579.039 --> 3582.559
everything right but I

3583.24 --> 3589.9199999999996
mean most of you here I know that you

3586.48 --> 3591.599
help me out in the best way you can you

3589.92 --> 3593.64
really mean it you really want to

3591.599 --> 3596.599
support me but you got your own issues

3593.64 --> 3598.7599999999998
with your own lives and I mean

3596.599 --> 3602.2400000000002
financially the world's not exactly like

3598.76 --> 3606.0
a thriving Place overall right now so I

3602.24 --> 3608.4399999999996
totally get it I don't expect you to

3606.0 --> 3611.92
just be able to like oh just support me

3608.44 --> 3614.4
twice the amount like uh no I get

3611.92 --> 3617.64
it

3614.4 --> 3620.64
but my overall coverage the overall

3617.64 --> 3623.92
people that follow me and appreciate

3620.64 --> 3626.68
what I do here if that number could

3623.92 --> 3631.559
grow then potentially more supporters

3626.68 --> 3634.72
could become part partake

3631.559 --> 3637.599
here and that would improve my overall

3634.72 --> 3639.72
situation and potentially the quality of

3637.599 --> 3643.599
my

3639.72 --> 3643.5989999999997
shows so share the

3644.319 --> 3649.96

3691.92 --> 3696.2400000000002
share it and especially if there's

3693.44 --> 3700.7200000000003
somebody out there that you think like

3696.24 --> 3702.8799999999997

or interested in having a conversation

3702.88 --> 3708.599
with a flat earther on

subject that is by the way it's now a

3750.559 --> 3758.4
hashtag in my list yeah simatic

3754.76 --> 3762.0
architecture # simatic architecture also

3758.4 --> 3766.7200000000003
I put # nonlocal holographic angular

3762.0 --> 3766.72
manifestations in there so the

3768.359 --> 3774.319
overall our wian terminologies are

3771.319 --> 3774.319

3805.64 --> 3811.72
to check it out like after the show

3808.799 --> 3812.839
today CU there's not going to be any

3811.72 --> 3816.24

3812.839 --> 3819.599
programs so I will actually check it

3816.24 --> 3821.64
out I don't know if it's funny or how it

3819.599 --> 3826.2000000000003

3821.64 --> 3829.96
see I mean David Wise was

3826.2 --> 3829.96
very positive about

3832.359 --> 3837.72
it so yeah I will check it out

3864.72 --> 3870.8799999999997
this is so weird is isn't it

3867.16 --> 3873.48
like my chat there's just like two

3870.88 --> 3875.839
camps you got the non ranches and they

3873.48 --> 3878.44
always just seem to Yap back and

3875.839 --> 3880.92
forth until wrenches come in and then

3878.44 --> 3883.4
they all just shut up all of a sudden

3880.92 --> 3887.7200000000003
and then it's just the wrench is talking

3883.4 --> 3887.7200000000003
I see this happening every single

3889.119 --> 3893.6800000000003
time it's kind of weird

3904.039 --> 3908.7200000000003
it's like all the non-w wrenches are

3905.52 --> 3908.72
suddenly hiding or

3912.359 --> 3917.44
something what the raccoon destroyed

3914.68 --> 3921.9199999999996

I'm going to ban

4029.76 --> 4038.119

4033.96 --> 4040.96
impossible it's one

4038.119 --> 4043.359
minute

4040.96 --> 4046.4
yeah it's not impossible to have a

4043.359 --> 4049.68
conversation most people would

4046.4 --> 4053.64
to type 200 characters would take them a

4049.68 --> 4056.0
minute it's nonsense yeah the only thing

4053.64 --> 4059.319
that the slow mode here does is prevent

4056.0 --> 4064.52
people from just blabbering on nonsense

4059.319 --> 4064.52
very quickly and spam my chat full with

4071.92 --> 4077.92

4288.84 --> 4297.28
of people that will literally be ether

4294.4 --> 4301.879999999999
religious yeah I am willing to talk with

4297.28 --> 4304.28
people about what they think of as ether

4304.28 --> 4310.639
simatic architecture it's a

4306.52 --> 4314.0
thing but then I'm here to explain to

4310.639 --> 4317.639

4364.4 --> 4370.5199999999995
yeah you're really getting on my nerves

4367.12 --> 4370.5199999999995
with this crap

4382.6 --> 4387.2390000000005
right I don't think it was out of order

4384.48 --> 4391.638999999999
that much it might have been kind of

4387.239 --> 4395.44
harsh but I mean yeah sometimes I get

4391.639 --> 4397.56
annoyed and then might come off a little

4395.44 --> 4400.0
strong when I do that sort of thing and

4397.56 --> 4403.52
yeah I'm sorry about

4400.0 --> 4407.159
that but yeah I'm not going to

4403.52 --> 4409.0
tolerate you being a whiny complainy

4407.159 --> 4411.44

Gary no I didn't ask for

4432.48 --> 4440.239
that it anybody everybody else here in

4436.0 --> 4440.239
did I ask for Gary to say those

4440.92 --> 4447.92
things did I ask him like hm why do you

4444.719 --> 4450.92
think seeking star water isn't coming

4447.92 --> 4454.0
back oh Gary F why don't you tell me

4450.92 --> 4456.4800000000005
exactly why you think especially

4454.0 --> 4461.36
relating to feelings why she did did I

4456.48 --> 4461.36
ask that anybody in the chat here

4472.76 --> 4475.76
kind of oh

4483.96 --> 4488.84
really I'll take that as a no

4519.52 --> 4525.360000000001
yes duper the cable issue was fixed like

4521.88 --> 4525.36
a week ago

4530.12 --> 4532.76
was it a week

4533.199 --> 4537.599999999999
ago no no a few days

4539.4 --> 4542.4
ago

4542.48 --> 4546.919999999999
Wednesday man it feels like it's been

4544.76 --> 4549.52
forever

4546.92 --> 4553.56
ago I'm really used to having cable

4549.52 --> 4553.56
internet again it's great

4562.36 --> 4566.159
right so yeah I mean I'll leave it is

4564.159 --> 4569.36
seeking star water I mean she doesn't

4566.159 --> 4573.08
like everyone to come back but I

4569.36 --> 4575.92
mean just it's the same with people that

4573.08 --> 4580.0
are going to like

4575.92 --> 4582.679
act Christian in a dogmatic way like if

4580.0 --> 4586.04
you do that you're going to end your

4582.679 --> 4588.719
criticism about it

4586.04 --> 4591.36
like it's it's going to it's going to

4588.719 --> 4595.56
happen and so if you're an etherite and

4591.36 --> 4598.839999999999
you literally say things that cannot

4595.56 --> 4601.2390000000005
make sense like that are not logical

4598.84 --> 4603.0
constructed sentences I'm going to

4601.239 --> 4607.759999999999
criticize you for it and and I'm going

4603.0 --> 4611.12
to call you dumb for it cuz it is and if

4607.76 --> 4614.12
that's really harsh or whatever I'm

4611.12 --> 4618.04
sorry I'm really sorry but it's what I

4614.12 --> 4621.96
do I am honest about it and I'm trying

4618.04 --> 4626.28
to find a way through not to not be

4621.96 --> 4626.28
harsh anymore but to help

4627.199 --> 4633.759999999999
you figure out a way through right

4631.12 --> 4636.199
because there are things there are

4633.76 --> 4639.04
things in the world that are mysterious

4636.199 --> 4641.48
and that might lead you to believe

4639.04 --> 4643.679
there's some kind of a thing that would

4641.48 --> 4646.638999999999
be called ether that holds everything

4643.679 --> 4650.04
together or whatever like force in Star

4646.639 --> 4653.8
Wars right but I want to get real with

4650.04 --> 4658.6
that I don't want to have some

4653.8 --> 4662.639
nonsense myth become a religion that is

4658.6 --> 4662.639
then acceptable to talk about

4663.28 --> 4667.199
nonsensically I don't accept

4667.719 --> 4675.36
that that's why I'm trying to figure out

4672.44 --> 4678.44
what are these things I'm taking the

4675.36 --> 4681.48
elements that are associated with ether

4678.44 --> 4684.199
and then I'm giving them a better

4681.48 --> 4685.599999999999
context like simatic architecture how

4684.199 --> 4688.4
that's a real thing what's really

4685.6 --> 4692.56
happening in there and how there is no

4688.4 --> 4692.5599999999995
ether it has nothing to do with

4698.28 --> 4704.96
it right and yeah I am fascinated with

4702.56 --> 4708.159000000001
those things as well

4704.96 --> 4709.56
I'm just not gonna have myself be pulled

4708.159 --> 4713.44
into to

4709.56 --> 4717.6
another stupid mental aberration that

4713.44 --> 4719.919999999999
makes no sense and that literally like

4717.6 --> 4723.120000000001
trims down your

4719.92 --> 4725.28
faculties your logical senses like I

4723.12 --> 4726.32
will not accept that I will fight

4725.28 --> 4729.159
against

4726.32 --> 4732.0
that even if it hurts your

4729.159 --> 4733.44
feelings I will do my best to basically

4732.0 --> 4735.44
find a way through I'm not just going to

4733.44 --> 4737.48
like oh attack you you're ether believer

4735.44 --> 4739.879999999999
so I'm I'm just not accepting it I'm

4737.48 --> 4740.599999999999
just going to attack you and not provide

4739.88 --> 4743.28
a

4740.6 --> 4747.04
solution no I am trying to provide a

4743.28 --> 4747.04
solution I'm I'm working on it

4749.08 --> 4754.6
literally and maybe that's unacceptable

4752.44 --> 4757.919999999999
for seeking St I mean it's not the first

4754.6 --> 4760.320000000001
time that this has happened I got into a

4757.92 --> 4763.719
spat with her over

4760.32 --> 4766.48
ether but since the last time her entire

4763.719 --> 4770.159
attitude about it was identical it was

4766.48 --> 4772.599999999999
identical she said to the same level the

4770.159 --> 4774.638999999999
same types of things and did not make

4772.6 --> 4777.360000000001
any excuses

4774.639 --> 4781.4400000000005
whatsoever did not give a

4777.36 --> 4781.44
reason and I do find that

4791.52 --> 4797.52
inacceptable yeah I I don't want to deal

4794.36 --> 4797.5199999999995
with religious

4797.88 --> 4802.88
people like

4799.679 --> 4806.4800000000005
that I don't want to deal with religious

4802.88 --> 4809.2390000000005
people when it comes to

4806.48 --> 4813.239
Christians right people that believe in

4809.239 --> 4816.04
things can't be logical about it believe

4813.239 --> 4819.0
in Dogma that's not actually

4816.04 --> 4821.44
biblical all that sort of thing like I

4819.0 --> 4823.76
don't want to deal with that and I don't

4821.44 --> 4828.08
want to deal with people that believe in

4823.76 --> 4831.679
ether say things to back it that don't

4828.08 --> 4833.36
make any logical sense have inherent

4831.679 --> 4836.56
self-contradictions within the

4833.36 --> 4840.28
Declaration like that's not

4836.56 --> 4842.84
acceptable I'm going to

4840.28 --> 4845.199
basically address that and I'm going to

4842.84 --> 4849.4400000000005
criticize you about it and potentially

4845.199 --> 4851.5599999999995
shame you if you hold on to it and don't

4849.44 --> 4853.839999999999
respond

4851.56 --> 4856.639
logically it's what I do and I'm going

4853.84 --> 4856.639
to keep doing it

4857.159 --> 4862.599999999999
I'm not apologizing for

4859.28 --> 4866.36
that I'm apologizing if I hurt

4862.6 --> 4869.360000000001
feelings and I'm welcoming you back but

4866.36 --> 4872.639
I mean I did those things for a reason

4869.36 --> 4875.32
and maybe I was extra cranky so I came

4872.639 --> 4878.52
off too strong was a bit Overkill

4875.32 --> 4882.36
perhaps and I'm sorry for that aspect

4878.52 --> 4886.4800000000005
but I'm not sorry for criticizing people

4882.36 --> 4890.28
over holding on to dogmatic nonsense

4886.48 --> 4890.28
beliefs I will not do

4911.28 --> 4917.48
that right so and yeah I mean i' love to

4915.199 --> 4919.5599999999995
see seeking star water

4917.48 --> 4922.759999999999
back but

4919.56 --> 4925.96
uh I mean I did what they did and they

4922.76 --> 4929.1990000000005
have a reason for that

4925.96 --> 4931.04
and I mean yeah maybe she just can't

4929.199 --> 4933.638999999999
discuss

4931.04 --> 4937.32
it maybe she can have a rational

4933.639 --> 4939.32
discussion about it well then she does

4937.32 --> 4941.96
practically have a

4939.32 --> 4945.159
problem if you have a

4941.96 --> 4946.88
dogma and you can't be reasonable

4945.159 --> 4949.5199999999995
about it

4946.88 --> 4951.56
then you're we're just going to keep

4949.52 --> 4954.1990000000005
bumping heads about that and that'll

4951.56 --> 4957.1990000000005
never go away

4954.199 --> 4960.04
then right so maybe that's the reason

4957.199 --> 4961.4
why she's not here because she realizes

4960.04 --> 4964.639
like yeah this is just going to keep

4961.4 --> 4965.839999999999
happening over and over again until I'm

4964.639 --> 4970.1990000000005
like too

4965.84 --> 4970.1990000000005
sick to even care about it all

4970.88 --> 4976.4800000000005
anymore I hope not

4974.679 --> 4978.0
maybe she's just busy maybe she's just

4976.48 --> 4980.718999999999
like yeah you know what I'm going to

4978.0 --> 4982.6
like just stick to myself for like a

4980.719 --> 4984.719
week and just get off the internet or

4982.6 --> 4986.8
something that can happen as well I mean

4984.719 --> 4988.32
it wouldn't be the first

4986.8 --> 4990.52
time

4988.32 --> 4994.36
so whatever it

4990.52 --> 4997.0
is think I spoke about it

4994.36 --> 4998.36
enough you all know where I stand with

4997.0 --> 5002.44
these

4998.36 --> 5005.96
things I mean I hate Dogma like I

5002.44 --> 5010.719
despise it

5005.96 --> 5013.04
and that Dogma is in all sectors Dogma

5010.719 --> 5013.04
is

5013.48 --> 5021.5199999999995
everywhere it's in intellectual Insight

5016.52 --> 5023.400000000001
it's in religions and it is including in

5021.52 --> 5026.360000000001
social

5023.4 --> 5030.28
behaviors people have dogmatic social

5026.36 --> 5032.719
behaviors too like a way things are that

5030.28 --> 5036.04
you can't logically reason out or

5032.719 --> 5040.4
Justify yet they will insist things be

5036.04 --> 5043.159
done those ways without being even like

5040.4 --> 5046.12
explanatory about it that's also

5043.159 --> 5049.28
dogmatic dogmatic social

5046.12 --> 5052.639
behavior and I hate that as well I

5049.28 --> 5052.639
despise it

5055.96 --> 5063.4800000000005
passionately oh okay Gary

5059.44 --> 5067.638999999999
well you get a 24-hour timeout for that

5063.48 --> 5067.638999999999
I see you doing that again you're

5074.04 --> 5083.56
banned yeah you do that again you're

5078.199 --> 5087.96

5096.719 --> 5102.159
having to endure your whining periodic

5100.0 --> 5104.639
whining for a week now and I'm not

5102.159 --> 5108.159
having it anymore I'm not having your

criticism I mean you're prob the next

5117.32 --> 5121.599999999999
sentence I see from you it's probably

5119.159 --> 5124.08
going to make me ban you that is what I

5121.6 --> 5125.0
suspect I might as well just ban you

5124.08 --> 5127.719
right

5125.0 --> 5131.639
now what do you guys

5127.719 --> 5135.2390000000005

LSG what do you think should I just ban

5135.239 --> 5141.839999999999
Gary Fe right

5138.52 --> 5144.0
now or shall I wait for the next damn

5141.84 --> 5145.76
thing he says in my chat and then ban

5144.0 --> 5148.92
him because he's going to say something

5145.76 --> 5148.92
really shitty I know he

5149.4 --> 5153.839999999999

5168.52 --> 5174.080000000001
that thank you for your opinion Steven

5171.08 --> 5174.08
Jarvis

5175.19 --> 5182.3189999999995
[Music]

5202.719 --> 5207.88
I mean seriously the goal Gary the goal

5206.32 --> 5211.04
you

5207.88 --> 5214.1990000000005
got to basically tell me like what I

5211.04 --> 5215.8
just did the explanation that I gave is

5214.199 --> 5219.36
is like not an

5215.8 --> 5219.360000000001
apology I was

5219.679 --> 5226.719
apologetic yeah but I'm also explanatory

5223.76 --> 5230.119000000001
like trying to be

5226.719 --> 5235.159
preventative with a lot of

5230.119 --> 5235.159
context yeah cuz those things

5236.08 --> 5239.5599999999995
matter and then coming back with that

5238.56 --> 5244.56
kind of

5239.56 --> 5244.56
attitude you're just a [ __ ]

5250.639 --> 5257.719
right so you think about it for 24 hours

5253.84 --> 5257.719
and if you do that again you're out of

5257.92 --> 5263.04
here and anybody else that has that kind

5260.84 --> 5265.03
of attitude you're going to be out of

5263.04 --> 5270.14
here too

5265.03 --> 5270.139999999999
[Music]

5275.96 --> 5278.84
yes aiz I

5280.119 --> 5285.199
know yeah stick up for everyone yeah and

5283.04 --> 5285.199
he

5285.6 --> 5292.0
shouldn't yeah he already stuck

5289.08 --> 5295.0
up then I addressed

5292.0 --> 5297.52
it and then he basically is telling me

5295.0 --> 5300.239
that's not good enough who the [ __ ] you

5297.52 --> 5300.2390000000005
think you are

5300.44 --> 5307.759999999999
Gary who the [ __ ] do you think you are

5304.76 --> 5307.76
talking to me like

5311.84 --> 5315.679
that I don't know what that means

5314.239 --> 5319.48
Stephen

5315.679 --> 5319.4800000000005
Jarvis stop using

5319.92 --> 5324.4800000000005
acronyms spell it out

5363.56 --> 5368.52
yeah and then I mean who the hell even

5365.639 --> 5370.6
is scary like I've

5368.52 --> 5375.360000000001
known seeking

5370.6 --> 5378.76
starwater for years years yeah I even

5375.36 --> 5378.759999999999
got her Tarot deck and

5382.96 --> 5389.719
everything like I think I even had her

5385.48 --> 5393.48
on the show like a long time ago by now

5389.719 --> 5396.04
and hey I I'd love to have her again it

5393.48 --> 5399.119
would be pretty cool even to have this

5396.04 --> 5401.76
specific discussion about

5399.119 --> 5404.48
ether the misconceptions about it but

5401.76 --> 5407.719
also like the interesting traits of

5404.48 --> 5410.919999999999
it to just

5407.719 --> 5413.159
clarify right and once things are

5410.92 --> 5415.719
clarified about

5413.159 --> 5418.839999999999
it this is what I predict will happen

5415.719 --> 5422.76
people will still call it

5418.84 --> 5426.96
ether as a catchall

5422.76 --> 5430.4800000000005
name but at least they would

5426.96 --> 5433.36
realize that it isn't literal that it

5430.48 --> 5436.159
isn't a literal thing it's a catch all

5433.36 --> 5438.799999999999
phrase a

5436.159 --> 5442.679
descriptor that points at different

5438.8 --> 5445.639
things that aren't actually directly

5442.679 --> 5449.96
connected and that despite their

5445.639 --> 5454.719
suggestive nature don't prove that there

5449.96 --> 5456.96
is this mystical backdrop field

5454.719 --> 5459.6
that is a medium for a bunch of things

5456.96 --> 5459.6
that is called

5460.88 --> 5467.84
ether I want that to be cleared up I

5463.639 --> 5470.4400000000005
mean these fascinating Associated

5467.84 --> 5472.84
ideas

5470.44 --> 5475.919999999999
and Engineering

5472.84 --> 5477.88
based tricks and side

5475.92 --> 5480.4
effects are

5477.88 --> 5483.159000000001
fascinating I don't want people to like

5480.4 --> 5486.08
oh don't don't ever talk about that oh

5483.159 --> 5488.239
avoid it because of ether like I know

5486.08 --> 5489.92
I'm not like that I like those things I

5488.239 --> 5491.08
think they're fascinating I think that

5489.92 --> 5492.56
there's a lot of things that we could

5491.08 --> 5496.04
learn from

5492.56 --> 5499.280000000001
them just know what it is just know what

5496.04 --> 5502.8
is what get

5499.28 --> 5506.199
real learn things real don't learn

5502.8 --> 5509.0
things through dogmatic

5506.199 --> 5510.96
delusion if you learn dogmatic delusion

5509.0 --> 5512.8
then somebody could just like slap you

5510.96 --> 5514.6
in the face with reason about it and

5512.8 --> 5517.639
then you have nothing

5514.6 --> 5520.4800000000005
you have nothing but broken heart

5517.639 --> 5521.8
feelings that's the whole problem about

5520.48 --> 5526.28
[ __ ]

5521.8 --> 5527.8
Dogma if you don't have any concrete

5526.28 --> 5531.04
intellectual

5527.8 --> 5533.88
foundations for reasoning and you stick

5531.04 --> 5536.44
to dogmatic holding on to a belief that

5533.88 --> 5539.639
you can't reason out you're just going

5536.44 --> 5543.04
to end up with

5539.639 --> 5544.36
losses nothing to present for it it's

5543.04 --> 5547.44
not good

5544.36 --> 5547.44
is not good for

5551.96 --> 5558.0
you but they will always need something

5554.6 --> 5560.639
to explain gyog gri really they do do

5558.0 --> 5563.28
they need

5560.639 --> 5566.28
that

5563.28 --> 5567.719
why why do they need that it's a

5566.28 --> 5571.5599999999995
man-made

5567.719 --> 5573.84
device and besides it's only ring laser

5571.56 --> 5577.0
gyroscopes that do that regular

5573.84 --> 5577.0
gyroscopes don't do

5579.639 --> 5585.119
that right so you need something to

5582.92 --> 5588.08
explain a drift well maybe there is some

5585.119 --> 5590.44
kind of a drift but it's in a man-made

5588.08 --> 5595.48
device it's not Universal not all these

5590.44 --> 5597.5199999999995
things drift so what does that

5595.48 --> 5600.08
exactly lead

5597.52 --> 5603.0
to there has to be something that's

5600.08 --> 5607.76
causing that drift does it or is the

5603.0 --> 5607.76
drift just a an unexpected side

5622.4 --> 5629.119
effect yeah Dogma

5625.04 --> 5630.88
dealers and pushers like drug dealers

5629.119 --> 5634.92
yeah we

5630.88 --> 5638.400000000001
do it's a thing

5634.92 --> 5641.159
and it's disgusting it's bad it's

5638.4 --> 5643.759999999999
intellectually

5641.159 --> 5645.44
suppressive it makes people stop

5643.76 --> 5649.159000000001
developing their own

5645.44 --> 5652.32
ideas it halts intellectual development

5649.159 --> 5655.759999999999
Dogma halts intellectual

5652.32 --> 5658.159
development and I am like fundamentally

5655.76 --> 5658.159000000001
against

5658.48 --> 5664.638999999999
it no Frank regular mechanical

5662.32 --> 5668.0
gyroscopes Don't Drift

5664.639 --> 5668.0
that's absolutely

5669.36 --> 5674.4
wrong I had one that drift yeah you know

5672.44 --> 5676.599999999999
what what a a regular mechanical

5674.4 --> 5680.32
gyroscope that drifts you know you know

5676.6 --> 5683.92
what that is it's called a broken

5680.32 --> 5687.799999999999
gyroscope yeah mechanical gyroscopes

5683.92 --> 5691.52
Don't Drift if they do they're

5687.8 --> 5694.52
broken yeah they're not supposed to

5691.52 --> 5695.56
drift when you buy them from the Factory

5694.52 --> 5698.400000000001
and they

5695.56 --> 5701.4800000000005
drift then they're

5698.4 --> 5704.239
broken and you can literally like return

5701.48 --> 5706.799999999999
them send them back say like uh this one

5704.239 --> 5708.5199999999995
drifts it's broken can I have a new one

5706.8 --> 5711.4400000000005
that isn't broken and they'll send you a

5708.52 --> 5715.679
new one that isn't broken yeah because

5711.44 --> 5715.678999999999
mechanical gyroscopes that drift are

5721.28 --> 5727.44
broken oh yay

5724.56 --> 5729.6
it had a broken gyroscope and it drifted

5727.44 --> 5734.48
and it keeps drifting and

5729.6 --> 5734.4800000000005
that's what's the point to that

5756.88 --> 5760.4400000000005
okay stepen Jarvis nobody

5760.719 --> 5766.679
cares I don't go on baller channels it's

5763.84 --> 5766.679
a waste of my

5772.6 --> 5780.360000000001
time H good duper that is a good

5777.119 --> 5782.679
thing yeah think before you send the

5780.36 --> 5785.48
message that's right and and check what

5782.679 --> 5788.639
you put down did you say it

5785.48 --> 5791.199
correctly maybe you need to correct some

5788.639 --> 5794.719
spelling there or you forgot a word and

5791.199 --> 5799.119
just enter it in between there before

5794.719 --> 5799.119
you send the message that's

5804.239 --> 5807.239
right

5808.76 --> 5814.639
what the [ __ ] are you blabbering about

5811.199 --> 5814.638999999999
plunder 23

5817.96 --> 5823.199
he made the gym scale oh well really

5820.76 --> 5826.0
impressive he made it

5823.199 --> 5828.839999999999
broken because mechanical gyroscopes are

5826.0 --> 5832.679
not supposed to drift

5828.84 --> 5832.679
specifically not supposed to

5834.239 --> 5839.5599999999995
drift

5835.8 --> 5841.88
so impressive engineering well I'd say

5839.56 --> 5844.56
no not so impressive engineering if he

5841.88 --> 5845.88
ended up making it mechan iCal gyroscope

5844.56 --> 5850.2390000000005
that drifts

5845.88 --> 5850.2390000000005
well not that impressive

5852.0 --> 5856.199
then I mean you might be impressed

5854.48 --> 5858.5199999999995
because you think that mechanical

5856.199 --> 5860.919999999999
gyroscopes should be drifting but that's

5858.52 --> 5863.679
because you're just wrong you have a

5860.92 --> 5866.4
delusional opinion about how gyroscopes

5863.679 --> 5866.4
are supposed to

5872.44 --> 5876.48
function for

5912.0 --> 5918.84
keep pretending is a

5914.48 --> 5922.598999999999
Frank are you being a Ballard right

5918.84 --> 5927.08
now oh it's like on a globe it's really

5922.599 --> 5929.400000000001
I really so the gyroscope drift

5927.08 --> 5932.48
horizontally

5929.4 --> 5934.08
like at the equator north of the equator

5932.48 --> 5936.199
south of the equat really should it just

5934.08 --> 5939.04
spin like this oh it's drifting like

5936.199 --> 5941.96
this oh no no it shouldn't drift like

5939.04 --> 5944.239
that on a ball should only drift on a

5941.96 --> 5949.28
ball like that when you're at the North

5944.239 --> 5949.28
Pole or South Pole huh

5950.44 --> 5957.0
dumbass being a dumbass right now trying

5954.32 --> 5963.239
to sneak in a little ball

5957.0 --> 5963.239
belief very ill thought through Frank

5975.36 --> 5980.5199999999995
now they wouldn't go whizzing off a

5977.48 --> 5983.36
th000 miles hour as these that's

5980.52 --> 5986.4400000000005
nonsense has nothing to do with it no

5983.36 --> 5990.679
the drift would be in relation to the

5986.44 --> 5993.839999999999
axis of presupposed spinning ball Earth

5990.679 --> 5996.56
that's how the drift would take place

5993.84 --> 5999.400000000001
but it never does that broken gyroscopes

5996.56 --> 6004.84
never drift like that neither do ring

5999.4 --> 6007.92
laser gyroscopes yeah no they drift

6004.84 --> 6011.88
perpendicular to the ground they drift

6007.92 --> 6015.32
like that they never drift like that or

6011.88 --> 6018.1990000000005
like that or however it's supposed to

6015.32 --> 6021.36
drift because of the orientation to

6018.199 --> 6025.159
presupposed axis of spinning ball Earth

6021.36 --> 6028.159
no they always drift like that

6025.159 --> 6030.799999999999
always yeah but you don't think about

6028.159 --> 6033.638999999999
that cuz you're

6030.8 --> 6035.679
barded you don't think about logical

6033.639 --> 6038.719
mechanical

6035.679 --> 6042.52
consequences these things and I get it

6038.719 --> 6042.52
you're Bard can't help

6048.239 --> 6054.799999999999
it yeah I'm sure that's really funny

6051.92 --> 6056.719
Frank I mean I'd kick them out of Fe

6054.8 --> 6059.1990000000005
core too if they were going to do

6056.719 --> 6062.96
something that [ __ ]

6059.199 --> 6062.96
[ __ ] cuz it is

6067.28 --> 6072.119
[ __ ] yeah you're going to claim oh

6069.8 --> 6074.84
it's spinning just like the ball earth

6072.119 --> 6077.92
oh really is it spinning per like

6074.84 --> 6080.08
parallel to the axis they supposed axis

6077.92 --> 6082.599
was ball Earth no it isn't well then

6080.08 --> 6083.76
you're a [ __ ] for suggesting such a

6082.599 --> 6086.1990000000005
thing

6083.76 --> 6089.360000000001
you're [ __ ] if you suggest that a

6086.199 --> 6092.759999999999
gyroscope is spinning as it is supposed

6089.36 --> 6096.36
to on a ball earth when it is not

6092.76 --> 6100.52
parallel to the axis of presupposed ball

6096.36 --> 6100.5199999999995
Earth that means you're

6101.8 --> 6108.159000000001
[ __ ] if somebody I associated with

6105.36 --> 6111.598999999999
tried to do that I'd kick them out of

6108.159 --> 6113.799999999999
the group too cuz that's

6111.599 --> 6117.0
[ __ ] they shouldn't be be part of

6113.8 --> 6117.0
that group

6126.24 --> 6129.41
[Music]

6132.72 --> 6136.31
[Music]

6146.08 --> 6151.92
threaten sue him I would know I don't

6149.639 --> 6151.92
really

6154.96 --> 6161.4
care probably has to do with the

6157.8 --> 6162.2390000000005
investment you see Fe core was sponsored

6161.4 --> 6165.679
in

6162.239 --> 6167.839999999999
ways and so if you're getting paid to

6165.679 --> 6171.36
develop things and you're then going to

6167.84 --> 6174.2390000000005
publish it in opposition to the

6171.36 --> 6178.88
objectives of Fe core

6174.239 --> 6183.44
then yeah if you literally got sponsored

6178.88 --> 6186.08
paid money by F core for a specific

6183.44 --> 6190.48
objective and then you go Rogue with

6186.08 --> 6192.679
your attempts to publish yeah yeah they

6190.48 --> 6197.32
they should have sued him over it if

6192.679 --> 6200.679
he'd done that cuz that guy got paid by

6197.32 --> 6203.48
Fe core probably because that's how they

6200.679 --> 6206.4800000000005
operate so that's perfectly legit it

6203.48 --> 6206.48
Frank

6219.91 --> 6223.01
[Music]

6242.239 --> 6247.638999999999
that's right duper you're very

6244.88 --> 6249.679
correct that's a good observation indeed

6247.639 --> 6251.96
if gyroscopes would react to Earth's

6249.679 --> 6254.119
spin then they would be displayed at

6251.96 --> 6256.76
museums next to the focal

6254.119 --> 6259.0
pendulum because it would be continual

6256.76 --> 6261.679
proof like oh look now the Earth is

6259.0 --> 6263.679
spinning see because the gyroscope keeps

6261.679 --> 6265.84
drifting exactly

6263.679 --> 6268.52
in accordance to the a like you could

6265.84 --> 6268.52
use the

6269.32 --> 6275.04
gyroscope you could you the gyroscope

6273.0 --> 6277.599
would be an effective

6275.04 --> 6281.4
tool for

6277.599 --> 6284.119000000001
navigation even because how the

6281.4 --> 6286.679
gyroscope would drift would show you

6284.119 --> 6288.839999999999
exactly where in relation to the axis of

6286.679 --> 6292.04
spinning ball Earth you

6288.84 --> 6293.639
are it would be an extra side tool

6292.04 --> 6296.04
besides

6293.639 --> 6298.159000000001
Celestial navigation which wouldn't be

6296.04 --> 6300.56
all that functional anyway on the ball

6298.159 --> 6302.48
Earth you can't really do that properly

6300.56 --> 6304.159000000001
right but you would use the gyroscope

6302.48 --> 6307.48
instead and just see like oh how's this

6304.159 --> 6310.759999999999
gyroscope been drifting oh so we're so

6307.48 --> 6313.4
we're here on this

6310.76 --> 6316.400000000001
latitude cuz you would find that out

6313.4 --> 6317.96
because of how the gyroscope drifts it's

6316.4 --> 6321.92
a very good

6317.96 --> 6324.88
point duper it's very perceptive of you

6321.92 --> 6327.52
yeah but it isn't gyroscopes are

6324.88 --> 6330.159000000001
specifically used because they don't

6327.52 --> 6333.639
drift They Don't Drift over time they

6330.159 --> 6335.5599999999995
Don't Drift over

6333.639 --> 6339.599
location they

6335.56 --> 6344.719
stay rigid in their orientation within

6339.599 --> 6344.719
space no matter how the surroundings

6346.119 --> 6351.28
move that's the whole point of a

6348.28 --> 6351.28
gyroscope

6353.28 --> 6358.719
right and ring laser gyroscopes might

6355.28 --> 6360.96
drift for some mechanical reason that is

6358.719 --> 6365.2390000000005
inherent to it yeah but that drift is

6360.96 --> 6367.719
still going to be like this yeah and not

6365.239 --> 6370.32
in relation to presupposed axis of

6367.719 --> 6376.88
spinning ball Earth

6370.32 --> 6376.88
yeah so it's not a glow proof whatsoever

6396.76 --> 6405.119000000001
if they work they would be in [ __ ] air

6399.56 --> 6408.4800000000005
yeah but why do they have gyroscopes in

6405.119 --> 6411.5599999999995
airplanes so that if you maneuver around

6408.48 --> 6413.36
or you go down you can still

6411.56 --> 6418.719
see what

6413.36 --> 6421.159
horizontal is it's to orient yourself

6418.719 --> 6424.44
quickly in chaotic

6421.159 --> 6426.28
situations to know exactly like how to

6424.44 --> 6430.159
keep level that's what they use the

6426.28 --> 6434.48
gyroscope for because it's so incredibly

6430.159 --> 6437.32
stable and it doesn't drift and so even

6434.48 --> 6440.32
if you fly at night you can still check

6437.32 --> 6443.4
at the gyroscope or the tools that

6440.32 --> 6445.239
directly use the gyroscope to show you

6443.4 --> 6448.04
like what is horizontal how is

6445.239 --> 6450.839999999999
horizontal oh are you at an angle are

6448.04 --> 6452.5199999999995
you going up are you going down well

6450.84 --> 6454.92
that you you can check that thanks to

6452.52 --> 6456.8
the gyroscope that get keeps perfectly

6454.92 --> 6459.8
rigid within ukian

6456.8 --> 6462.08
space yeah that's how they use the tool

6459.8 --> 6462.08
of the

6468.04 --> 6475.8
gyroscope you know how why you keep

6471.0 --> 6475.8
asking that for

6526.639 --> 6533.04
yeah disas job why are you asking

6533.199 --> 6537.5199999999995
what's the point you want to make some

6534.44 --> 6537.5199999999995
point about a gyro

6553.88 --> 6558.76
Compass is there some kind of point

6571.639 --> 6575.96
wow that's [ __ ]

6618.48 --> 6626.0
okay it's G Compass it's just a system

6622.0 --> 6628.48
that basically just uses a gyroscope and

6626.0 --> 6632.0
then in relation to a

6628.48 --> 6632.0
map gives you

6632.36 --> 6640.639
orientation so yeah there oh the claim

6636.48 --> 6642.119
oh yeah I just read the Wikipedia it's

6640.639 --> 6647.599
it's just

6642.119 --> 6651.92
a another stupid bald hearted [ __ ]

6647.599 --> 6651.92
explanation about it

6662.639 --> 6667.76
ridiculous Wit It accepted the

6664.88 --> 6669.96
mechanical gyroscope drift well he's

6667.76 --> 6674.360000000001
kind of [ __ ] like that

6669.96 --> 6674.36
so you know it's not my

6680.96 --> 6687.4
problem been looking into to them

6684.239 --> 6689.879999999999
okay so what's your conclusion then oh

6687.4 --> 6692.759999999999
well the Earth is a ball because in

6689.88 --> 6694.76
Wikipedia it says that it adapts to the

6692.76 --> 6698.599
spinning ball Earth

6694.76 --> 6698.599
nonsense you believe that

6703.42 --> 6706.47
[Music]

6711.52 --> 6715.56
[ __ ] for

6767.639 --> 6774.32
so J or do you believe in that [ __ ] you

6771.36 --> 6777.48
believe what what they say about it in

6774.32 --> 6782.079
the Wikipedia page what they say about

6777.48 --> 6782.079
gyroasis do you believe that

6825.56 --> 6834.4400000000005
you're just going to leave it silent now

6829.0 --> 6834.44
jug hey why the [ __ ] did you bring it

6834.679 --> 6840.04
up huh why did you bring that up

6846.199 --> 6852.759999999999
jog you believe the engineers who

6849.119 --> 6856.5199999999995
engineered the Gus oh so you're just

6852.76 --> 6860.56
being a ballart then just going to take

6856.52 --> 6863.88
the construction nonsense

6860.56 --> 6868.56
stories yeah

6863.88 --> 6868.56
gyroscopes stay rigid in ukian

6871.239 --> 6877.598999999999
space that's their primary functions

6874.28 --> 6877.599
what makes a gyroscope a

6877.92 --> 6880.92
gyroscope

6881.079 --> 6889.679
yeah and yeah you can Orient yourself if

6884.96 --> 6893.0
you have a a map that you can coordinate

6889.679 --> 6895.4
with internally electronically with the

6893.0 --> 6898.88
gyroscope orientation then it's like

6895.4 --> 6901.598999999999
yeah it's like a the gyroscope can

6898.88 --> 6904.679
basically show

6901.599 --> 6907.56
you roughly where you would be on the

6904.679 --> 6909.8
map if you keep track of it unless

6907.56 --> 6913.119000000001
there's a severe disorientation all of a

6909.8 --> 6915.28
sudden and but I mean it's it's just a

6913.119 --> 6918.28
basic gyroscope function with some

6915.28 --> 6921.679
elaborate gadgets on

6918.28 --> 6923.679
it yeah it doesn't have anything to do

6921.679 --> 6926.84
with a ball

6923.679 --> 6926.84
Earth at

6940.52 --> 6945.639
all

6942.199 --> 6947.638999999999
oh oh okay well Frank hey hey if you're

6945.639 --> 6949.2390000000005
going to be like that what the [ __ ] are

6947.639 --> 6954.079
you even doing

6949.239 --> 6954.079
here what are you doing here Frank

6957.239 --> 6962.718999999999
yeah I mean you believe the the people

6959.52 --> 6965.159000000001
from Wikipedia too about the coris

6962.719 --> 6967.32
deviation yeah you believe that coriolis

6965.159 --> 6969.28
is an actual deviation caused by

6967.32 --> 6971.0
spinning ball Earth

6969.28 --> 6974.0
theia

6971.0 --> 6976.92
that spinning of hurricanes and

6974.0 --> 6978.679
tornadoes is because of earth spin that

6976.92 --> 6980.159
that is coral you believe that too

6978.679 --> 6984.04
because that's in

6980.159 --> 6986.598999999999
Wikipedia you believe that too

6984.04 --> 6990.56
huh were you one of those

6986.599 --> 6993.4800000000005
people are are you just a anti flat

6990.56 --> 6995.56
earther infiltrant that's just like

6993.48 --> 6998.44
you're just supposed to hang around this

6995.56 --> 7001.4800000000005
Flat Earth channel to make sure that

6998.44 --> 7003.32
people still have Reasonable Doubt to

7001.48 --> 7004.959999999999
believe that the flat earther is

7003.32 --> 7007.119
actually a [ __ ] [ __ ] who doesn't

7004.96 --> 7010.32
know what he's talking about

7007.119 --> 7013.719
huh or you didn't say you believe it oh

7010.32 --> 7016.079
well it's telling you that though huh

7013.719 --> 7019.0
it's telling you oh that's engineered

7016.079 --> 7021.96
specifically to accommodate for the ball

7019.0 --> 7026.119
earth oh yes that's what it

7021.96 --> 7029.8
says yeah and you believe

7026.119 --> 7033.199
them very prominently telling me here

7029.8 --> 7033.1990000000005
huh Frank

7052.44 --> 7058.159
yeah so hey whatever man you want to

7055.4 --> 7060.96
believe you're on a [ __ ] [ __ ]

7058.159 --> 7062.92
baller that violates natural law in

7060.96 --> 7068.2390000000005
every conceivable

7062.92 --> 7068.2390000000005
way you go and believe that then [ __ ]

7068.639 --> 7073.400000000001
dumbass it's not my problem

7074.44 --> 7080.239
I had no idea about them

7077.159 --> 7085.44
no it's it's a gyroscope you could call

7080.239 --> 7085.44
them a gyro Compass it's still a

7094.639 --> 7101.4800000000005
gyroscope gyroscope is just a gyroscope

7097.88 --> 7104.56
it functions as a gyroscope stays rigid

7101.48 --> 7106.36
in UK in space while it's spun up it

7104.56 --> 7109.76
doesn't naturally

7106.36 --> 7112.88
drift definitely does not drift because

7109.76 --> 7116.92
we're on a spinning ball

7112.88 --> 7120.1990000000005
Earth yeah they would have very very

7116.92 --> 7122.719
specific drift orientation if that were

7120.199 --> 7126.199
the case and it isn't the case and it

7122.719 --> 7128.8
never was the case and there's no device

7126.199 --> 7132.159
that drifts in a way that comports with

7128.8 --> 7134.360000000001
spinning ball Earth no form of gyroscope

7132.159 --> 7136.879999999999
including the ones that are

7134.36 --> 7140.199
supposedly normally drifting like ring

7136.88 --> 7142.0
laser gyroscopes yeah they don't drift

7140.199 --> 7145.598999999999
in a way that has anything to do with

7142.0 --> 7149.52
the idea of being on a spinning ball

7145.599 --> 7153.8
Earth yeah no matter what some Wikipedia

7149.52 --> 7153.8
page is going to say about it

7162.239 --> 7169.199
yeah I don't need to know anything about

7165.96 --> 7172.52
anything before today in order to tell

7169.199 --> 7174.638999999999
you exactly what's going on with

7172.52 --> 7178.0
that

7174.639 --> 7180.52
yeah and I mean gyro compasses have

7178.0 --> 7182.56
compassed in discussion earlier when we

7180.52 --> 7185.599
were all about the gyroscopes over at

7182.56 --> 7188.76
Flat Earth of eight years ago I kind of

7185.599 --> 7191.28
just kind of forgot about

7188.76 --> 7193.84
it I'm just going to stick to what I

7191.28 --> 7198.36
know about the fundamentals of

7193.84 --> 7198.360000000001
gyroscopes what makes gyroscopes so

7200.88 --> 7204.28
special yeah and what makes them so

7203.079 --> 7207.28
special is

7204.28 --> 7207.28
their

7209.119 --> 7214.598999999999
rigidity their

7211.119 --> 7217.119
unchanged orientation when they spin up

7214.599 --> 7220.56
that's what makes them so special what

7217.119 --> 7224.199
you can do with them because of

7220.56 --> 7227.1990000000005
that like that the F the foundation of

7224.199 --> 7229.199
gyroscopes and their function and that's

7227.199 --> 7232.44
what I'm going to rest on I'm not going

7229.199 --> 7234.28
to be deluded by some Wikipedia article

7232.44 --> 7238.5199999999995
that's telling me like oh no they're

7234.28 --> 7242.4
they're using the the gyroscope

7238.52 --> 7244.679
to because of how it would move around

7242.4 --> 7246.96
the spinning ball Earth to orient

7244.679 --> 7250.639
yourself where you are without using

7246.96 --> 7254.0
magnetism oh yeah that's

7250.639 --> 7256.4800000000005
propaganda that's mind control

7254.0 --> 7259.599
lies yeah the Earth is not a spinning

7256.48 --> 7262.0
ball mechanical gyroscopes Don't Drift

7259.599 --> 7264.4400000000005
if they do they're broken they're not

7262.0 --> 7264.44
made

7266.079 --> 7272.599
properly because gyroscopes that

7269.719 --> 7275.4
function except for ring laser Gyros

7272.599 --> 7277.92
Don't Drift They Don't Drift this

7275.4 --> 7282.96
mechanical gyroscopes Don't Drift they

7277.92 --> 7282.96
do they're dysfunctional they're broken

7292.639 --> 7298.32
spinning stabilizing

7296.28 --> 7300.8
thing what the hell I don't know what

7298.32 --> 7305.759999999999
you're talking about calendar 23 anyway

7300.8 --> 7305.76
I'm going to turn my coffee on be right

7310.84 --> 7314.88
back e

7333.54 --> 7336.649
[Music]

7400.76 --> 7403.76
e

7430.719 --> 7434.76
e for

7469.8 --> 7472.2390000000005
and I'm

7479.0 --> 7485.32
back oh wow by the way weather's really

7481.92 --> 7485.32
clearing up it's kind of

7487.28 --> 7491.239
nice seems like there's Trails or

7489.76 --> 7492.4800000000005
something but I mean I don't think those

7491.239 --> 7494.678999999999
are like

7492.48 --> 7496.759999999999
actual chem Trill

7494.679 --> 7501.599
originated just looks

7496.76 --> 7506.320000000001
like wind feathers natural natural

7501.599 --> 7509.32
ones cuz that does actually happen

7506.32 --> 7511.679
naturally like that

7509.32 --> 7515.36
sometimes now if they'd all be Criss

7511.679 --> 7518.4
Crossing each other then i' I'd be more

7515.36 --> 7520.639
inclined to think that they were left by

7518.4 --> 7523.799999999999
airplanes of some

7520.639 --> 7527.1990000000005
kind since they're all parallel like

7523.8 --> 7530.8
that I don't think they are I think it's

7527.199 --> 7530.799999999999
natural it's pretty

7532.239 --> 7536.598999999999
cool it's nice to have some sun

7541.159 --> 7545.44
again you were about to cut the grass

7543.44 --> 7548.079
for the first time in the year in the

7545.44 --> 7548.079
thunderstorm

7548.239 --> 7552.839999999999
rolling all righty then

7558.5 --> 7561.72
[Music]

7569.599 --> 7574.2390000000005
have you used a Custer

7575.92 --> 7580.0
no you mean an orone

7580.239 --> 7587.119
generator I don't really have

7583.239 --> 7590.0
one but I mean you can technically do

7587.119 --> 7590.0
that with your own

7593.48 --> 7598.119
intentions would be kind of interesting

7595.639 --> 7599.559
to actually I think I'm the next time

7598.119 --> 7601.88
I'm going to call with my healer I'm

7599.559 --> 7605.1990000000005
going to ask him

7601.88 --> 7608.679
that if you could use the technique to

7605.199 --> 7608.678999999999
try to do something like

7610.199 --> 7615.119
that that would be pretty interesting

7626.8 --> 7633.399
[Music]

7664.159 --> 7670.719
yeah whatever Frank how the hell do you

7666.96 --> 7670.719
even know that [ __ ]

7680.84 --> 7684.919
[Music]

7689.8 --> 7697.2390000000005
seriously you even bringing that up like

7692.4 --> 7697.239
makes me highly suspicious of you

7720.159 --> 7726.5199999999995
didn't mean to upset you

7722.719 --> 7726.52
oh I'm sure you

7729.92 --> 7736.28
didn't I watch Michael K's chemtrail

7733.079 --> 7736.28
videos no I have

7743.559 --> 7749.92
not maybe in the past or something I

7746.159 --> 7749.92
don't know I haven't heard from him in

7759.199 --> 7764.719
ages how the as

7762.04 --> 7764.719
how is that

7773.44 --> 7780.919999999999
funny to do the lawn like what the hell

7776.88 --> 7780.92
is that supposed to mean

7791.8 --> 7796.88
yeah it's not like that it's really

7795.36 --> 7799.558999999999
[ __ ] annoying I

7796.88 --> 7802.079
mean if you guys keep making those

7799.559 --> 7805.159000000001
[ __ ] stupid jokes about it like I'm

7802.079 --> 7807.28
just going to not talk about it anymore

7805.159 --> 7810.0
and going to keep it completely

7807.28 --> 7813.32
private and then everybody can go [ __ ]

7810.0 --> 7815.88
themselves about it I'll just use it in

7813.32 --> 7818.719
private because it works and I'll keep

7815.88 --> 7821.4400000000005
it to people that I care about in

7818.719 --> 7823.76
private and just never bring it up again

7821.44 --> 7826.199
again because all you really seem to do

7823.76 --> 7829.079000000001
is just make stupid jokes with

7826.199 --> 7834.079
it just a little joke yeah it's a little

7829.079 --> 7834.079
really [ __ ] annoying joke it's

7840.32 --> 7846.799999999999
disrespectful yeah that's what the

7842.119 --> 7846.799999999999
trolls do I don't want that

7865.4 --> 7869.4
okay LSG that's hilarious

7886.559 --> 7892.2390000000005
I mean it if if I were you I just don't

7889.04 --> 7894.92
even talk to these guys in the chat I

7892.239 --> 7897.638999999999
mean they're all

7894.92 --> 7901.04

up Jesus Christ these [ __ ]

7958.719 --> 7961.8
suggestions are

7966.36 --> 7973.36
horrendous YouTube is like these

7970.199 --> 7976.36
suggestions and the results are

7973.36 --> 7976.36
just

7977.239 --> 7984.44
horrendous horrendous search results

7992.239 --> 7998.759999999999
yeah trying to find Michael KH might

7995.52 --> 8002.4800000000005
even be subscribed to him it's just it

7998.76 --> 8002.4800000000005
wouldn't show up

8023.84 --> 8030.32
man it's just way too many channels that

8026.96 --> 8032.679
I'm subscribed to way too many and I

8030.32 --> 8036.36
like clean out

8032.679 --> 8040.92
like 30 or 40 of them like a few months

8036.36 --> 8040.92
ago Jesus Christ too many

8043.559 --> 8051.559
channels why the [ __ ] am I subscribed to

8048.28 --> 8057.079
archaics get the hell out of

8051.559 --> 8057.079000000001
here what a shitty channel that is

8079.84 --> 8084.84
you just put in Michael con yeah well I

8082.76 --> 8088.400000000001
just put in Michael Con in the search

8084.84 --> 8092.92
and then I get anything but Michael

8088.4 --> 8092.92
KH I just get

8094.0 --> 8097.96
or is this icon these days

8098.88 --> 8105.559
like a quarter prolic with like a clown

8102.679 --> 8105.559
wig is that

8112.52 --> 8117.320000000001
him oh [ __ ] it is

8115.32 --> 8119.96
him

8117.32 --> 8122.28
huh just another spray

8119.96 --> 8125.559
day is that the video you're talking

8122.28 --> 8128.639
about it's from 4 days

8125.559 --> 8130.88
ago oh [ __ ] yeah it is him I can see him

8128.639 --> 8133.2390000000005
now on

8130.88 --> 8138.0
camera

8133.239 --> 8138.0
huh and I am subscribed

8138.119 --> 8144.04
okay why didn't he show up in my

subscribers list that is so

8148.079 --> 8153.799999999999
weird okay

8151.04 --> 8156.639
so yeah I don't

8153.8 --> 8159.84
know I'm looking at it it's like yeah oh

8156.639 --> 8162.639
Trails yeah well dude like I'm not even

8159.84 --> 8164.92
talking about that anymore it's so

8162.639 --> 8167.8
casual to

8164.92 --> 8170.76
be I mean this happens all the time it's

8167.8 --> 8170.76
been happening since

8171.199 --> 8177.44
95 yeah it's been happening almost 30

8179.36 --> 8185.598999999999
years that's 2/3 of my life Chemtrails

8184.119 --> 8188.598999999999
have been

8185.599 --> 8188.599
around

8189.08 --> 8195.548999999999
[Music]

8209.319 --> 8212.84
so h

8219.599 --> 8226.559
hey Lucy level hello yeah thanks I I was

8223.599 --> 8229.28
very happy about yesterday's show hope

8226.559 --> 8229.279999999999
you enjoyed

8232.8 --> 8238.8
that by all means leave a comment you

8235.599 --> 8241.84
know I mean the comment section is

8238.8 --> 8245.438999999998
open it it would be nice if somebody

8241.84 --> 8248.519
would maybe write a comment there and

8245.439 --> 8248.519
not just [ __ ]

8249.519 --> 8254.479
trolls I mean I don't even understand

8252.559 --> 8258.438999999998
how this works just look at other

8254.479 --> 8260.639
channels and they just get like 50

8258.439 --> 8261.479000000001
comments just people saying oh that's

8260.639 --> 8266.438999999998
kind of

8261.479 --> 8266.438999999998
cool it's like I get

8267.2 --> 8271.319000000001
zero like how does that even work how

8269.96 --> 8273.24
does that even work with with the amount

8271.319 --> 8277.24
of views that I

8273.24 --> 8281.319
get just nobody leaves casual

8277.24 --> 8281.319
comments I don't understand

8282.599 --> 8288.84
why right I have to clean up The Troll

8285.639 --> 8292.0
comments every damn time but nobody just

8288.84 --> 8295.479
leaves casual comments I don't

8292.0 --> 8295.479
understand why

8302.439 --> 8308.960000000001
it's just I brought up Crossing Trails

8305.639 --> 8312.8
yeah that usually happens with Camp

8308.96 --> 8315.039999999999
Trails they're not spray parallel they

8312.8 --> 8317.199999999999
just cross each other so if it's all

8315.04 --> 8321.0
parallel that's a sign that it's

8317.2 --> 8323.399000000001
actually naturally formed to

8321.0 --> 8326.92
me all right anyway I'm going to get my

8323.399 --> 8326.92
coffee be right

8329.719 --> 8333.759999999998
back e

8378.12 --> 8382.880000000001
right so if you appreciate my shows and

8380.0 --> 8385.639
what I do here please don't forget to

8382.88 --> 8385.639
Rogan it

8388.2 --> 8393.240000000002
up and consider supporting me through

8391.439 --> 8395.960000000001
the PayPal or becoming part of my

8393.24 --> 8399.72
patreon I can really use the

8395.96 --> 8399.72
support can use it a

8400.439 --> 8406.800000000001
lot I am going to check my PayPal let's

8403.399 --> 8411.76
see if anybody left

8406.8 --> 8411.759999999998
anything cuz I'll be needing it

8423.88 --> 8430.92
trying to be tolerant

8426.84 --> 8432.92
here no Ballers are just you'll still

8430.92 --> 8435.439
get on my nerves I

8432.92 --> 8437.28
mean I don't even know sometimes if

8435.439 --> 8440.12
you're just trying to get on my nerves

8437.28 --> 8441.16
trying to force your ball belief back on

8440.12 --> 8444.52
on the

8441.16 --> 8450.039999999999
table or whether it's just like by

8444.52 --> 8450.04
happen stance I'm not even sure like

8451.399 --> 8458.479
I never fully trust

8454.52 --> 8461.76
Ballers I trust you have a a personhood

8458.479 --> 8464.319
I trust that you have human feelings and

8461.76 --> 8468.12
therefore there is Dynamics

8464.319 --> 8470.92
but it real ball beli I never really

8468.12 --> 8475.08
trust them because they always try

8470.92 --> 8478.88
to sneak in and undermine flat earthers

8475.08 --> 8482.399
with with just stuff that gets handed

8478.88 --> 8486.519999999999
down by the control system to reinforce

8482.399 --> 8486.519999999999
W belief they always end up doing

8488.6 --> 8494.2
that and especially after they're like

8491.88 --> 8496.92
really eager to declare themselves like

8494.2 --> 8501.439
oh we're really friends oh yeah I'm a

8496.92 --> 8504.88
baller but I'm really a friend oh really

8501.439 --> 8508.319
why yeah usually people that talk like

8504.88 --> 8510.839999999998
that they just trying to claim

8508.319 --> 8513.199999999999
friendship to eventually

8510.84 --> 8516.0
for some level of

8513.2 --> 8518.6
manipulation yeah that's my personal

8516.0 --> 8521.56
experience in this last eight

8518.6 --> 8524.12
years that's why I never really fully

8521.56 --> 8527.16
trust a baller because they always end

8524.12 --> 8527.160000000002
up doing that kind of

8539.52 --> 8543.479000000001
[ __ ] e

8575.28 --> 8578.379
[Music]

8595.399 --> 8602.199999999999
anyway I heard a lot about Red Dead

8598.96 --> 8606.8
Redemption that's supposedly really

8602.2 --> 8610.08
cool it's an older game by now but yeah

8606.8 --> 8613.278999999999
I I've never really played it does sound

8610.08 --> 8616.12
really like a cool game

8613.279 --> 8621.08
though so maybe at some point I'll I'll

8616.12 --> 8625.04
get to be able to play that but uh yeah

8621.08 --> 8625.039999999999
I mean I'm not in a hurry

8636.04 --> 8641.92
what what does that

8638.52 --> 8641.92
mean Ste

8645.439 --> 8649.800000000001
Jarvis same creators of

8650.279 --> 8656.399000000001
GTA right

8652.319 --> 8656.399
but but that game just

8657.359 --> 8665.0
sucks I mean Red Dead Redemption is like

8660.16 --> 8665.0
a Wild West set setting and then it's

8666.04 --> 8673.880000000001
like it just makes more sense it's more

8670.72 --> 8676.16
doable it's not because GTA is just

8673.88 --> 8679.479
disgusting criminal

8676.16 --> 8681.359
crap I hate it I hate every [ __ ]

8679.479 --> 8684.72
thing about

8681.359 --> 8689.08
it never liked it always hated it it

8684.72 --> 8689.08
only got worse over time

8690.52 --> 8695.359
but Red Dead Redemption I mean it's a

8692.319 --> 8698.8
wild west setting so it's like yeah it's

8695.359 --> 8698.800000000001
it's supposed to be like

8703.81 --> 8707.41
[Music]

8709.439 --> 8716.92
that so I guess it's more

8712.479 --> 8716.92
forgivable in that sense

8742.56 --> 8746.439
is there any PC version of that game by

8744.88 --> 8751.438999999998
the

8746.439 --> 8754.279
way or is it really like place station 4

8751.439 --> 8754.279
or whatever

8769.72 --> 8775.278999999999
exclusive it's on PC too huh

8778.92 --> 8783.84
okay you donated gustos to your PayPal

8782.24 --> 8787.399
four time you

8783.84 --> 8790.8
did okay Steven Jarvis well thanks

8787.399 --> 8790.8
thanks for the support like

8791.04 --> 8796.12
that I do appreciate that

8814.319 --> 8816.84
hey Mr

8818.399 --> 8823.08
Cheswick hey good to see you man how are

8820.92 --> 8823.08
you

8824.6 --> 8829.960000000001
doing enjoyed listen yeah no I'm very

8827.24 --> 8832.84
happy about the the show yesterday with

8829.96 --> 8832.839999999998
Dave it was

8833.76 --> 8838.319
great

8835.64 --> 8840.479
like I wasn't sure how it was going to

8838.319 --> 8844.16
roll out how FL it was going to be but

8840.479 --> 8846.278999999999
just came rolling in had a lot of energy

8844.16 --> 8848.479
and just like classic talking about Flat

8846.279 --> 8851.960000000001
Earth stuff which I'm like always up for

8848.479 --> 8853.88
that I like that and manag to like

8851.96 --> 8857.599999999999
really bring out detail and the

8853.88 --> 8860.119999999999
developments the because my objection my

8857.6 --> 8864.319
objective not objection objective is

8860.12 --> 8866.960000000001
always to to sharpen that edge to

8864.319 --> 8869.08
progress the overall grip as a flat

8866.96 --> 8872.72
earther that we have on the situation

8869.08 --> 8873.96
and I really felt that was capable of of

8872.72 --> 8876.319
applying

8873.96 --> 8879.08
that with our

8876.319 --> 8881.319
show and we even at the end like got to

8879.08 --> 8884.56
talk about well friction between

8881.319 --> 8887.8
communities between camps between tribes

8884.56 --> 8889.6
as it were and was able to effectively

8887.8 --> 8892.64
address it in

8889.6 --> 8895.0
a in a constructive way and I'm very

8892.64 --> 8897.68
happy about how that ended

8895.0 --> 8901.16
up I was a bit worried that it might go

8897.68 --> 8904.68
astray I mean

8901.16 --> 8909.24
David did seem distressed over

8904.68 --> 8911.56
it and it was like oh like feeling like

8909.24 --> 8913.439
I was going to have to be defensive

8911.56 --> 8916.56
potentially but I mean it it worked out

8913.439 --> 8918.960000000001
and I'm very happy about it I think that

8916.56 --> 8918.96
it it

8920.319 --> 8928.039999999999
helped you believe in it yeah I know I

8924.319 --> 8932.039999999999
mean some people are just bald hearted

8928.04 --> 8932.04
they can't help themselves ke Jarvis

8938.16 --> 8945.08
latest

8939.279 --> 8945.08
one I don't want the latest one let see

8945.479 --> 8952.278999999999
level like I'm not interested in the

8948.8 --> 8955.319
latest level in the latest game like I'm

8952.279 --> 8957.720000000001
just generally not interested in oh the

8955.319 --> 8960.72
latest game oh really well then I don't

8957.72 --> 8960.72
care

8963.359 --> 8969.2
and I'm sure that my graphics card can

8966.399 --> 8973.16
handle those

8969.2 --> 8975.84
things right especially if I well lower

8973.16 --> 8978.399
the settings a bit within the game like

8975.84 --> 8980.439
I don't need oh I need the perfect

8978.399 --> 8982.0
Graphics I don't give a [ __ ] about the

8980.439 --> 8986.52
perfect

8982.0 --> 8990.0
Graphics like I could go with like low

8986.52 --> 8992.479000000001
resolution pixelated crap like I genu

8990.0 --> 8995.72
genuinely don't care about that at all

8992.479 --> 8995.72
all just costs energy

9003.52 --> 9007.16
anyway right I mean I'll start caring

9006.0 --> 9010.84
about that

9007.16 --> 9014.2
again if I can get a significantly

9010.84 --> 9014.2
better computer

9031.2 --> 9037.880000000001
yeah I know G H I know what happened I

9034.56 --> 9037.88
was there

9054.279 --> 9058.52
right

9055.319 --> 9061.278999999999
anyway anybody did appreciate it please

9058.52 --> 9061.279
donate to my

9061.76 --> 9066.68
PayPal support your local Arwin I can

9064.479 --> 9070.039999999999
really use the support I've had

9066.68 --> 9074.0
bills that I have to live through this

9070.04 --> 9076.279
month and if everything works out then

9074.0 --> 9079.88
at the end of the month I'll be all

9076.279 --> 9081.800000000001
right but I got to like live through

9079.88 --> 9085.88
through the next 3

9081.8 --> 9088.0
weeks so any support even little bits

9085.88 --> 9090.72
like five bucks or something is really

9088.0 --> 9090.72
going to help me

9091.0 --> 9094.0
out

9094.88 --> 9101.24
right of course 50 bucks or something

9098.279 --> 9105.52
would be super super

9101.24 --> 9108.92
helpful and then it would also make me

9105.52 --> 9111.6
not ebag so much eag oh why are you

9108.92 --> 9114.92
ebegging well support for the

9111.6 --> 9114.92
show right I

9115.319 --> 9122.64
mean I do have a show that's like 3

9118.92 --> 9124.76
hours every damn day for a very long

9122.64 --> 9128.16
time I

9124.76 --> 9129.92
mean do you expect me to just do this

9128.16 --> 9135.0
completely for

9129.92 --> 9137.359
free just spend all that time energy and

9135.0 --> 9141.08
development Community sense

9137.359 --> 9142.960000000001
argumentation all completely for nothing

9141.08 --> 9146.039999999999
I don't think that's reasonable so I

9142.96 --> 9148.0
mean people call it e bagging but I mean

9146.04 --> 9150.359
technically it isn't ebegging it's just

9148.0 --> 9154.64
like hey could I get some compensation

9150.359 --> 9158.0
for my work you know for my

9154.64 --> 9161.519999999999
efforts right whatever support is

9158.0 --> 9165.52
support and I can really use it right

9161.52 --> 9165.52
now any

9174.88 --> 9182.199999999999
VHS and cassettes yeah yeah no cassette

9178.04 --> 9183.52
tapes were great Mr chesswick I still

9182.2 --> 9186.76
have a cassette

9183.52 --> 9190.319000000001
player but I don't have any more tapes

9186.76 --> 9190.319
maybe there's a tape in there I don't

9191.31 --> 9194.85
[Music]

9196.64 --> 9202.24
remember but the funny thing about like

9199.24 --> 9205.52
that's the big difference right a CD

9202.24 --> 9209.24
player has like really serious

9205.52 --> 9212.52
electronic systems in them that can and

9209.24 --> 9216.08
probably will break a cassette tape is

9212.52 --> 9220.08
like a purely mechanical thing like it

9216.08 --> 9222.24
has some electric components in it but

9220.08 --> 9226.12
not really electronic it's like a

9222.24 --> 9226.119999999999
mechanical thing

9230.96 --> 9234.278999999999
it's pretty amazing how it

9243.439 --> 9250.92
worked TI the tape back together

9247.6 --> 9254.960000000001
yes mag in the car steer yeah that does

9250.92 --> 9254.960000000001
typically yeah tapes can get super

9256.12 --> 9262.279
messy like sometimes cassette deck just

9259.479 --> 9264.519999999999
eat eat the tape then you have to like

9262.279 --> 9266.439
pull it out and the tape is all strung

9264.52 --> 9269.6
up and all that is

9266.439 --> 9272.12
terrible yeah I mean cassette tapes were

9269.6 --> 9273.359
cool until that sort of [ __ ] happened

9272.12 --> 9276.439
and then it

9273.359 --> 9279.359
sucked CDs never really had that problem

9276.439 --> 9282.319
although CD players like sometimes they

9279.359 --> 9286.319
like they don't read the CD

9282.319 --> 9288.0
properly it's like it just won't read it

9286.319 --> 9291.359
properly and then it starts glitching

9288.0 --> 9293.16
that can be annoying I mean since USB

9291.359 --> 9296.359
and it's all purely

9293.16 --> 9299.16
digital it's really

9296.359 --> 9303.319
ideal like even when I still had a car I

9299.16 --> 9305.76
had a CD player that had a USB in it and

9303.319 --> 9308.278999999999
I just had a USB stick just stick it in

9305.76 --> 9311.6
there and it just had Perfect music that

9308.279 --> 9314.0
never glitched ever and that really is

9311.6 --> 9314.0
the best

9317.92 --> 9324.24
solution all t expensive these days yeah

9321.72 --> 9324.24
it kind of

9327.16 --> 9333.319
is but it's also because it's like it

9330.0 --> 9335.2
requires maintenance it gets old and the

9333.319 --> 9339.56
plastic like

9335.2 --> 9339.560000000001
Withers it's problematic

9368.72 --> 9373.199999999999
but I mean it was pretty special that

9371.0 --> 9378.12
you could just

9373.2 --> 9380.240000000002
like have a video tape or a a cassette

9378.12 --> 9383.52
tape recorder

9380.24 --> 9385.319
just take a tape and you just like put

9383.52 --> 9389.08
it on record and it's like a live

9385.319 --> 9392.399
microphone and it just records it raw so

9389.08 --> 9394.2
it's not like oh a digital mp3 recorder

9392.399 --> 9396.519999999999
I'm going to click it and oh it's going

9394.2 --> 9399.84
to record it and then you have a sound

9396.52 --> 9401.84
file like how it is now no you just had

9399.84 --> 9404.439
the tape you put it in there you press

9401.84 --> 9406.52
record and just whatever is being picked

9404.439 --> 9409.92
up is going to be recorded in linear

9406.52 --> 9412.439
fashion and that's on that tape now that

9409.92 --> 9414.08
was pretty damn magical at the time I

9412.439 --> 9420.52
mean it really

9414.08 --> 9425.319
was like when computers were still like

9420.52 --> 9429.479000000001
[ __ ] like really dumb like pixelated

9425.319 --> 9432.96
nonsense terrible like it's like only a

9429.479 --> 9434.8
total nerd at the time would like be

9432.96 --> 9437.319
capable of dealing with computers

9434.8 --> 9440.72
because it was so tedious and then

9437.319 --> 9444.88
suddenly cassette decks and Recorders

9440.72 --> 9447.399
just came out and it's like who like so

9444.88 --> 9450.0
easy to use like anybody could use it

9447.399 --> 9452.199999999999
and people like made live music with

9450.0 --> 9452.2
that

9452.319 --> 9458.319
stuff like my mother being one of those

9454.72 --> 9458.319
people like she really worked with

9458.96 --> 9465.0
cassettes like professionally even it's

9461.68 --> 9468.399
amazing cassette tape were really

9465.0 --> 9471.96
amazing for the time it was

9468.399 --> 9471.96
revolutionary very

9472.2 --> 9475.68
functional low

9476.16 --> 9482.279
error and the CDs really only were an

9479.96 --> 9485.08
improvement in the sense that the sound

9482.279 --> 9487.640000000001
quality was better that's what really

9485.08 --> 9489.8
stood out with CDs because cassette tape

9487.64 --> 9493.88
still had like noise in

9489.8 --> 9496.24
it slightly sh but not enough to not be

9493.88 --> 9499.039999999999
able to enjoy the music it just had the

9496.24 --> 9502.6
no was a slight noise in there it's like

9499.04 --> 9505.640000000001
and see he suddenly was whoa silence

9502.6 --> 9508.479000000001
there's no noise that was the upgrade

9505.64 --> 9508.479
from CDs

9508.88 --> 9511.88
really

9512.12 --> 9517.92
vinyl

9514.72 --> 9522.08
yeah yeah vinyl that's before cassette

9517.92 --> 9525.88
tape but I mean vinyl is freaking clumsy

9522.08 --> 9530.479
it can't record a lot of music and that

9525.88 --> 9532.08
stuff had scratchy was scratchy as hell

9530.479 --> 9535.84
a lot of funny things you could do with

9532.08 --> 9538.24
it though like DJing and stuff I mean

9535.84 --> 9540.68
still being used today because of that

9538.24 --> 9543.399
because you could just like manually

9540.68 --> 9545.960000000001
speed it up or reverse it it's

9543.399 --> 9548.519999999999
interesting what you can do with vinyl

9545.96 --> 9551.919999999998
but I mean the sound quality is

9548.52 --> 9551.92
not not

9554.6 --> 9559.640000000001
great vinyl collection cool

9571.399 --> 9575.64
track recorder yeah exactly that stuff

9573.88 --> 9578.24
yeah my mother had that

9575.64 --> 9581.24
too like she worked professionally with

9578.24 --> 9581.24
that

9585.66 --> 9588.84
[Music]

9591.0 --> 9597.0
yeah I know G digital is more accurate

9594.08 --> 9600.479
and it's I mean digital has been a

9597.0 --> 9600.479
massive Improvement in many

9600.64 --> 9604.96
ways so yeah of course modern stuff is

9603.84 --> 9607.319
better

9604.96 --> 9611.119999999999
technically then again just look at

9607.319 --> 9614.399
what's happened to music in general it's

9611.12 --> 9616.880000000001
like all so attention grabby so over

9614.399 --> 9619.479
perfected over

9616.88 --> 9621.24
smooth people don't even take the the

9619.479 --> 9624.119999999999
effort to freaking learn to sing

9621.24 --> 9629.039999999999
properly anymore they just autot tune

9624.12 --> 9630.720000000001
their [ __ ] I mean modern music makes me

9629.04 --> 9632.6
like want to run

9630.72 --> 9635.88
away

9632.6 --> 9640.52
yeah like I haven't heard music come

9635.88 --> 9645.0
from any place any place whatsoever from

9640.52 --> 9647.960000000001
a car from a cafe from a festival that

9645.0 --> 9649.76
didn't just make me want to like I want

9647.96 --> 9650.96
to get out of here

9649.76 --> 9654.279
this is

9650.96 --> 9657.72
horrendous yeah I haven't had that

9654.279 --> 9659.880000000001
experience of actually liking music in

9657.72 --> 9663.0
like 20

9659.88 --> 9667.679999999998
years of anything I hear out there it's

9663.0 --> 9670.319
all horrifying to me

9667.68 --> 9672.92
horrifying right and it's only places

9670.319 --> 9675.72
where they just play older music where

9672.92 --> 9676.6
I'm like oh yeah oh cool I remember this

9675.72 --> 9679.679999999998
from the

9676.6 --> 9682.399000000001
9s yeah shitty but I mean it at least

9679.68 --> 9686.479000000001
it's not as

9682.399 --> 9689.92
horrendous as most music in current

9686.479 --> 9692.438999999998
ages because it is

9689.92 --> 9697.04
horrendous it's like an assault on your

9692.439 --> 9699.359
ears in spirit now and intellect too if

9697.04 --> 9701.439
you actually manage to be able to listen

9699.359 --> 9706.479000000001
to the

9701.439 --> 9706.479000000001
text it's just all an assault

9723.479 --> 9728.88
400b damn that's a lot Mr chz wig

9740.0 --> 9744.56
favorite group or singer

9745.04 --> 9753.04
no but in my early youth I was big fan

9750.04 --> 9755.560000000001
of the police and Kate Bush those are

9753.04 --> 9757.399000000001
the ones I like really remember that

9755.56 --> 9762.08
didn't afterward turn out to be

9757.399 --> 9763.84
incredibly gay like most freaking

9762.08 --> 9766.68
musicians

9763.84 --> 9771.12
so yeah that's that's kind of what I

9766.68 --> 9771.12
grow up grew up with even pre

9771.359 --> 9776.640000000001
and good

9773.72 --> 9779.88
music like it's still

9776.64 --> 9782.8
good and everything after that has been

9779.88 --> 9785.119999999999
just like part of like phases that I've

9782.8 --> 9785.119999999999
gone

9786.2 --> 9791.240000000002
through like I like early Prodigy too

9789.359 --> 9793.56
for example but I mean it's all part of

9791.24 --> 9797.479
a face it's

9793.56 --> 9802.96
like yeah most I mean what I listen now

9797.479 --> 9807.519999999999
is just it is like more modern digital

9802.96 --> 9810.72
music but I mean I'm very picky with it

9807.52 --> 9814.439
it's like so there'll be like 50 songs

9810.72 --> 9818.438999999998
and then like three out of those 50 I'm

9814.439 --> 9821.439
like huh this is not bad and the rest is

9818.439 --> 9825.399
like oh can we please just move on to

9821.439 --> 9829.56
the next song it's so annoying and like

9825.399 --> 9831.72
hear NeverEnding sjw

9829.56 --> 9834.8
nonsense

9831.72 --> 9837.16
placement like always the same [ __ ]

9834.8 --> 9839.119999999999
always the same

9837.16 --> 9842.119999999999
combination

9839.12 --> 9842.12
right

9842.64 --> 9849.68
like I'm so sick of it I'm so sick of

9846.24 --> 9852.56
this sjw influence in music universally

9849.68 --> 9855.359
it's so incredibly

9852.56 --> 9858.76
tedious I I don't

9855.359 --> 9862.08
want I don't want to keep the same race

9858.76 --> 9865.24
being pushed on me over and [ __ ] over

9862.08 --> 9867.76
again like I don't care about that I

9865.24 --> 9871.0
want to hear something else I want to

9867.76 --> 9874.84
hear another combination than just the

9871.0 --> 9877.479
same [ __ ] standard crap that comes

9874.84 --> 9877.479
out of

9877.64 --> 9882.24
everything I don't want to hear that

9879.88 --> 9883.96
anymore like ever

9882.24 --> 9888.68
again

9883.96 --> 9890.119999999999
ever I'm so sick of that standard sjw

9888.68 --> 9892.56
set

9890.12 --> 9894.92
in music and in movies but music it's

9892.56 --> 9894.92
like the

9895.08 --> 9902.24
worst same stupid [ __ ] Rhythm crap

9898.92 --> 9905.6
same stupid [ __ ] singing crap it's

9902.24 --> 9909.479
always the same crap over and over and

9905.6 --> 9909.479000000001
over again it's so

9912.39 --> 9915.699999999999
[Music]

9916.8 --> 9923.0
tedious Peter Gabriel's do

9920.12 --> 9928.76
yeah I guess so I kind of missed out on

9923.0 --> 9928.76
that or never really personally got into

9935.08 --> 9940.92
that he was from like the early guy from

9938.16 --> 9940.92
ra

9941.28 --> 9946.720000000001
[Music]

9943.72 --> 9949.76
right what the

9946.72 --> 9953.88
hell okay someone need to starting to

9949.76 --> 9958.960000000001
drill in the walls downstairs what the

9953.88 --> 9961.199999999999
hell Genesis oh RM gen uh what I mix

9958.96 --> 9961.199999999999
those

9962.52 --> 9968.720000000001
up right and then

9965.56 --> 9971.56
yeah then Collins took over from Genesis

9968.72 --> 9975.24
and then later he got into RM didn't he

9971.56 --> 9978.43
right I keep mixing those two up

9975.24 --> 9978.43
[Music]

9986.279 --> 9991.720000000001
but I mean we were never really like

9989.2 --> 9994.6
listening to that type of music all the

9991.72 --> 9998.039999999999
time it was appreciated but it wasn't

9994.6 --> 10001.479000000001
always on while things like Kate Bush

9998.04 --> 10003.76
and the police were on regularly we'd

10001.479 --> 10006.599999999999
play that we'd also play other more

10003.76 --> 10009.880000000001
obscure music

10006.6 --> 10012.359
like rert Hines

10009.88 --> 10017.0
which nobody's ever heard of that it's

10012.359 --> 10020.04
really weird like early synthesizer type

10017.0 --> 10021.92
music the weird music but very

10020.04 --> 10024.240000000002
interesting in

10021.92 --> 10027.16
ways like the guy is not even a good

10024.24 --> 10030.92
singer like at all but it's like when

10027.16 --> 10035.279
you hear that now it's like whoa you'll

10030.92 --> 10037.319
be impressed why because he just sung

10035.279 --> 10040.720000000001
when he's like obviously not that good a

10037.319 --> 10044.16
singer and they did autotune the [ __ ]

10040.72 --> 10046.679999999998
out of it it's just raw and that's

10044.16 --> 10049.76
amazing now like if you listen to that

10046.68 --> 10052.359
now compared to anything else out there

10049.76 --> 10057.24
like you will feel like wow this is like

10052.359 --> 10058.76
super hipster [ __ ] because it kind of is

10057.24 --> 10062.399
but that's like the stuff that we would

10058.76 --> 10065.880000000001
listen to a lot rert Hines very

10062.399 --> 10070.64
obscures and

10065.88 --> 10073.64
uh and also things like Prince

10070.64 --> 10074.76
Prince had some really good music he was

10073.64 --> 10077.24
a good

10074.76 --> 10079.56
musician my brothers was like really

10077.24 --> 10082.56
into

10079.56 --> 10082.56
it

10088.399 --> 10097.24
uh what else what

10092.319 --> 10097.24
else I don't remember a lot

10100.399 --> 10105.84
I just know that I was really into the

10102.96 --> 10109.399
police and into Kate Bush because

10105.84 --> 10111.24
there's just some really amazing songs

10109.399 --> 10113.76
that they made really

10111.24 --> 10116.96
amazing and I've always been like in

10113.76 --> 10119.68
love with like amazing

10116.96 --> 10121.399
songs like and then it never dies I just

10119.68 --> 10125.2

I'm not even going to attempt to sing

10162.64 --> 10169.039999999999
like Kate Bush but I remember like don't

10165.6 --> 10175.479000000001

10389.64 --> 10396.319
they have any appreciation for Modern

10391.56 --> 10399.08
Art your paintings are really

10396.319 --> 10401.359
interesting and I'm not normally a fan

10399.08 --> 10405.039999999999
of Modern Art at

10401.359 --> 10409.439
all but yours I i'

10405.04 --> 10409.439
probably accept that

10451.279 --> 10454.76

10453.04 --> 10460.319000000001
you doing

10454.76 --> 10460.319
man acting chilly what the hell is that

10466.239 --> 10474.76
mean yeah we discussed that

10470.16 --> 10480.279
duper we had a conversation about

10474.76 --> 10480.279
it why are you acting like this

10491.96 --> 10497.119999999999
who don't want allow FL contact rated

10494.479 --> 10500.16
that's not entirely true Mr Cheswick we

10497.12 --> 10503.04
just don't get a full Super Chat

10500.16 --> 10505.56
capability they try to get in the way of

10503.04 --> 10508.92
monetization I you experienced that

10505.56 --> 10514.439
recently I've been demonetized like a

10508.92 --> 10514.439
while ago I can try to remonetized

10518.6 --> 10523.880000000001
back and all

10519.72 --> 10526.72
that but uh yeah I mean there's plenty

10523.88 --> 10531.479
of Flat Earth channels that are really

10526.72 --> 10533.92
big and yeah I mean they don't give us

10531.479 --> 10535.479
like full priority of course but I mean

10533.92 --> 10538.6
it's not any different on other

10535.479 --> 10541.88
platforms Mr Cheswick sorry to tell you

10538.6 --> 10543.56
but that's literally

10541.88 --> 10546.88
everywhere

10543.56 --> 10549.399
everywhere they're all the same like all

10546.88 --> 10552.358999999999
of it

10549.399 --> 10556.68
the only places you won't have that

10552.359 --> 10556.68
is on private

10557.8 --> 10566.039999999999
websites that's where you don't get

10561.8 --> 10570.319
that every social media platform without

10566.04 --> 10572.2
exception applies Flat Earth suppressing

10570.319 --> 10575.439
algorithm all of

10572.2 --> 10579.0
it there is no social media platform

10575.439 --> 10581.439
that is public for public use where that

10579.0 --> 10583.6
isn't the case all of it do all of it

10581.439 --> 10587.0
there is no

10583.6 --> 10589.76
exception yeah you might explode

10587.0 --> 10590.96
somewhere guess what anybody especially

10589.76 --> 10592.439
around Flat Earth that's going to

10590.96 --> 10594.839999999998
explode yeah you get that for a while

10592.439 --> 10596.720000000001
and then oh they put the lid on and it

10594.84 --> 10599.880000000001
will never be the same and it doesn't

10596.72 --> 10601.679999999998
matter where you do that it'll happen

10599.88 --> 10605.519999999999
anywhere

10601.68 --> 10607.439
anywhere all happens suddenly explode

10605.52 --> 10611.08
and immediately put the lid on it and

10607.439 --> 10613.84
that's it it's over no more growth it's

10611.08 --> 10617.319

10798.16 --> 10805.68
just had a YouTube channel just to show

10802.239 --> 10809.72
your stuff I mean you make videos that

10805.68 --> 10811.84
you share with me over Skype to show us

10809.72 --> 10813.92
you should just have your own use your

10811.84 --> 10817.56
own YouTube channel to upload those

10813.92 --> 10819.52
videos just so you could just have a a

10817.56 --> 10821.519999999999
little video book that you can share

10819.52 --> 10824.479000000001
like oh look

10821.52 --> 10827.6
here this is what I do and just leave it

10824.479 --> 10831.119999999999

10833.6 --> 10836.319
take a quick

10837.2 --> 10841.880000000001
look you should probably do that it

10840.08 --> 10845.16
wouldn't even be that hard to do I mean

10841.88 --> 10845.16
you already got the YouTube

10845.359 --> 10850.279
channel you already got the video so

10847.64 --> 10852.92
it's just a matter of uploading it and

10949.64 --> 10954.64
the bickering I'm done with all of the

10952.399 --> 10956.72
bickering I don't want to bicker anymore

10954.64 --> 10958.439
I don't want to bicker against other

10956.72 --> 10960.64
flat earthers I don't want to bicker

10958.439 --> 10964.359
with Ballers I definitely don't want to

10960.64 --> 10966.399
bicker about with anti

10964.359 --> 10969.16
flatters I just want

10966.399 --> 10971.72
to provide a good

10969.16 --> 10973.68
time and

10971.72 --> 10975.8
inspiration and that's that's what I

10973.68 --> 10978.319
want to do and I want to find a way

10975.8 --> 10979.479
through I want to find Solutions I want

10978.319 --> 10982.84
to be a

10979.479 --> 10984.96
diplomat even to people that think that

10982.84 --> 10986.76
they're Arch enemies with somebody else

10984.96 --> 10988.119999999999
I want to just show them the way through

10986.76 --> 10991.6
that's what I want to do that's how I

10988.12 --> 10993.68
want to apply my my Christianity to find

10991.6 --> 10995.960000000001
a way through to be a diplomat that's

10993.68 --> 10998.16
what I want to do is what I can do it's

10995.96 --> 10999.319
what I have been doing it's what I'm

10998.16 --> 11003.88
best

10999.319 --> 11007.56
at and that's really did come forward in

11003.88 --> 11007.56
yesterday's night ow show I

11011.279 --> 11017.68
thought yeah thank you Mr chesswick

11014.52 --> 11020.68
I'm glad you appreciate it I

11017.68 --> 11025.16
I it felt good I haven't watched it back

11020.68 --> 11025.16
yet so I am going to watch it back

11038.319 --> 11045.519999999999
oh look at this weather's really cleared

11041.08 --> 11045.52
up it's nice bit of

11046.439 --> 11053.800000000001
sun still these feathers out there but

11049.76 --> 11053.800000000001
look at how blue that sky is is that

11053.96 --> 11058.759999999998
beautiful plenty of Sun around

11068.52 --> 11071.92
think I have a talent for disting

11070.319 --> 11074.92
discussing in that setting I'd like to

11071.92 --> 11079.359
think so and I'd like

11074.92 --> 11081.56
to fulfill that that void yeah I

11079.359 --> 11083.76
couldn't fulfill that void as part of

11081.56 --> 11086.96
being fed I

11083.76 --> 11089.880000000001
couldn't fed I could barely find my own

11086.96 --> 11092.399
little corner in which I could make a

11089.88 --> 11097.199999999999
difference I had to struggle for that

11092.399 --> 11100.08
here I can make a difference all the

11097.2 --> 11103.68
time it's all about just connecting up

11100.08 --> 11107.64
and making sure I I keep the good energy

11103.68 --> 11111.439
going if I'm annoyed by something to not

11107.64 --> 11113.278999999999
like let that bog me down too much cuz

11111.439 --> 11116.319
that still does happen in occasion I

11113.279 --> 11118.880000000001
mean not always in a great

11116.319 --> 11120.399
mood sometimes everybody's like in a

11118.88 --> 11123.64
shitty mood and

11120.399 --> 11126.519999999999
then I get shouty and I'm like stop

11123.64 --> 11128.358999999999
making stupid jokes this is really

11126.52 --> 11130.239
annoying I mean when I'm in a bad mood

11128.359 --> 11133.12
and you guys are just goofing around

11130.239 --> 11135.16
making stupid silly jokes that actually

11133.12 --> 11139.880000000001
pisses me

11135.16 --> 11143.2
off cuz what that does is just weaken

11139.88 --> 11145.119999999999
the mind yeah if there's no good energy

11143.2 --> 11147.279
going around and you make stupid jokes

11145.12 --> 11151.08
it just weakens everybody's mind it

11147.279 --> 11154.239
makes you less focused now that might be

11151.08 --> 11157.359
intuitively the thing to do because if

11154.239 --> 11159.84
you're less focused then you notice less

11157.359 --> 11163.68
that there is a spirit of demoralization

11159.84 --> 11166.6
going around yeah but what it also does

11163.68 --> 11170.68
is make you not focused enough to be

11166.6 --> 11173.84
able to crawl out of that and so that

11170.68 --> 11176.239
literally then ruins everything and

11173.84 --> 11178.56
that's why I get so agitated with people

11176.239 --> 11181.279
when they're just goofing around

11178.56 --> 11181.278999999999
I don't like

11181.56 --> 11186.278999999999
that so there is actual reasoning behind

11184.68 --> 11189.439
why I do that it's not just because I

11186.279 --> 11189.439
want to be a stick in the

11190.6 --> 11196.319
mud like if there is this slight Spirit

11193.96 --> 11199.0
of demoralization going around for

11196.319 --> 11202.239
whatever reason then I want people to

11199.0 --> 11205.399
focus and just face that face it head on

11202.239 --> 11208.88
don't weaken yourself just so you don't

11205.399 --> 11211.16
notice it face it

11208.88 --> 11213.399
face the challenge directly and I know

11211.16 --> 11217.76
that's like the hardest challenge for

11213.399 --> 11220.239
every person in the world ever CU we all

11217.76 --> 11223.0
don't naturally do everybody

11220.239 --> 11226.84
instinctively tries to avoid that except

11223.0 --> 11226.84
me because I'm obsessed with

11228.68 --> 11234.68
that but it's better it's better if you

11232.04 --> 11237.92
just face demoralization

11234.68 --> 11241.12
headon don't try to weaken your mind

11237.92 --> 11245.479
which could be just making goofy stupid

11241.12 --> 11248.239000000001
jokes or like drinking yourself or like

11245.479 --> 11250.479
doing other drugs right that's the same

11248.239 --> 11254.08
the same reason you're doing

11250.479 --> 11257.599999999999
it you weaken yourself so that you don't

11254.08 --> 11259.319
notice that things are not that great

11257.6 --> 11261.56
you shouldn't do that just face it head

11259.319 --> 11263.96
on just stare it right in the face it's

11261.56 --> 11266.64
like today is a [ __ ] shitty

11263.96 --> 11269.278999999999
day it's like everything happens that

11266.64 --> 11272.88
sucks like everything I try will go

11269.279 --> 11275.359
wrong and just face it head on like do a

11272.88 --> 11278.08
blinking contest with the demoralization

11275.359 --> 11281.319
itself and it's like yeah I know you're

11278.08 --> 11284.279
shitty today world I know the energy is

11281.319 --> 11287.64
all wrong but I'm not going to Blink I'm

11284.279 --> 11291.12
not going to like give up just because

11287.64 --> 11294.199999999999
the energies are like not in my

11291.12 --> 11295.960000000001
favor just stare it straight in the face

11294.2 --> 11299.439
and

11295.96 --> 11299.438999999998
basically overcome

11299.76 --> 11306.08
it overcome it with

11302.92 --> 11309.88
Consciousness not with

11306.08 --> 11312.6
drugs and

11309.88 --> 11316.16
suppression it's better that

11312.6 --> 11320.319
way it works better on the long

11316.16 --> 11323.88
run it'll help you avoid

11320.319 --> 11325.92
weakness when a slight Spirit of

11323.88 --> 11328.039999999999
demoralization comes again which it

11325.92 --> 11330.52
always does it always does come back at

11328.04 --> 11334.359
some point right it comes up and down up

11330.52 --> 11337.439
and down this forever forever up and

11334.359 --> 11339.399000000001
down up and down forever it will forever

11337.439 --> 11342.12
be like that there's nothing you can do

11339.399 --> 11345.399
to stop that and trying

11342.12 --> 11349.04
to avoid realizing that doesn't help

11345.399 --> 11351.479
either just face it face it head on be

11349.04 --> 11353.84
honest be honest with yourself be honest

11351.479 --> 11357.92
with reality be honest when you feel

11353.84 --> 11359.8
shitty don't try to escape it

11357.92 --> 11364.8
face it head on be

11359.8 --> 11364.8
strong it's better you'll be

11368.88 --> 11372.64
stronger drill in a

11380.279 --> 11387.560000000001
wall

11444.12 --> 11447.319000000001
like that

11449.76 --> 11455.479
duper you always do this duper when are

11453.239 --> 11458.479
you going to learn not to do this when

11455.479 --> 11461.56
are you going to grow an

11458.479 --> 11466.319
intuition just

11461.56 --> 11469.6
stop grow some intuition

11466.319 --> 11473.319
already and I don't want your apologies

11469.6 --> 11476.319
after the fact just grow some intuition

11473.319 --> 11476.319
already

11477.52 --> 11480.52
e

11515.0 --> 11521.319
yeah when somebody pops

11518.12 --> 11525.960000000001
up they get immediately designated as a

11521.319 --> 11530.08
troll yeah that's not your cue to then

11525.96 --> 11535.358999999999
publicly be curious about

11530.08 --> 11538.039999999999
them yeah you do this every goddamn time

11535.359 --> 11543.12
duper when are you finally going to grow

11538.04 --> 11543.12
in intuition and stop doing that

11573.76 --> 11580.479
like every time a goddamn troll pops up

11577.52 --> 11584.2
I remove him I also have to then remove

11580.479 --> 11588.64
your [ __ ] comments because you always

11584.2 --> 11591.239000000001
comment you always inquire

11588.64 --> 11594.72
further when are you going to

11591.239 --> 11597.72
learn how many hundreds of times does

11594.72 --> 11600.56
this scenario need to repeat before you

11597.72 --> 11600.56
figure it out

11614.72 --> 11619.72
duper Jesters were allowed to make fun

11617.479 --> 11621.92
of the king humor is a way to speak

11619.72 --> 11626.519999999999
truth to power

11621.92 --> 11626.52
yeah I'm sure it is

11645.2 --> 11652.0
yeah and hey I mean if I get like super

11649.04 --> 11654.080000000002
upset at some point and it's like

11652.0 --> 11657.96
getting all emotional and somebody then

11654.08 --> 11661.0
could make a joke to lighten it up

11657.96 --> 11663.278999999999
and then yeah that that might work

11661.0 --> 11663.279
that's

11663.399 --> 11670.358999999999
cool but it's not cool if I'm like

11667.04 --> 11672.960000000001
trying to address a very serious subject

11670.359 --> 11676.92
that's in development and then you

11672.96 --> 11678.839999999998
basically Goof Off with not a good joke

11676.92 --> 11680.68
or a really creative joke but with

11678.84 --> 11683.359
something that kind of just distracts

11680.68 --> 11687.319
away from the subject at

11683.359 --> 11690.16
hand that's annoying

11687.319 --> 11695.479
that's not a Jester that's not what a

11690.16 --> 11698.76
Jester does gers don't make distracting

11695.479 --> 11701.319
jokes they make jokes that are to the

11698.76 --> 11704.399
point that are on the nose that are all

11701.319 --> 11706.68
about what's really there not being

11704.399 --> 11708.88
discussed because it's very sensitive

11706.68 --> 11711.800000000001
yeah that's what a Jester

11708.88 --> 11715.438999999998
does they don't make distracting

11711.8 --> 11715.438999999998
nonsense jokes

11719.479 --> 11724.039999999999
or maybe they do and then well they just

11721.399 --> 11724.039999999999
suck as a

11724.64 --> 11728.96
Jester but the whole point of a gesture

11727.12 --> 11733.479000000001
is that they

11728.96 --> 11737.08
always make light of the serious tough

11733.479 --> 11738.96
to address issues especially involving

11737.08 --> 11742.039999999999
in

11738.96 --> 11744.239
power that's what they make jokes about

11742.04 --> 11747.76
and that's like what they're legally

11744.239 --> 11751.439
allowed to make jokes about

11747.76 --> 11755.92
when others don't I mean anybody any

11751.439 --> 11758.720000000001
peon could just make a goofy distracting

11755.92 --> 11761.6
joke that distracts everybody and like

11758.72 --> 11763.119999999999
people will be like whatever and then

11761.6 --> 11768.0
the king doesn't

11763.12 --> 11771.960000000001
care yeah but you couldn't make a really

11768.0 --> 11776.479
on the nose joke about the king

11771.96 --> 11779.358999999999
himself as a peon cuz then would have

11776.479 --> 11782.198999999999
you killed for it only the jester would

11779.359 --> 11782.199
be able to do

11786.76 --> 11792.68
that oh I see he was just oh really

11789.72 --> 11795.358999999999
you're catching on now are you

11792.68 --> 11797.92
duper like are you like 10 minutes

11795.359 --> 11797.92
behind or

11803.359 --> 11807.84
something what the hell

11808.439 --> 11811.16
this isn't

11811.68 --> 11821.08
right the time stamps off how is this

11817.439 --> 11821.08
possible that's really

11827.12 --> 11834.12
weird that was really weird it was like

11830.239 --> 11838.68
set to 28 minutes and it kept rolling in

11834.12 --> 11838.68
27 that is so strange

11856.92 --> 11862.16
your WIS have

11859.359 --> 11864.399000000001
Ram yeah I'm sure they

11862.16 --> 11866.199
do yeah I'm going to round out the show

11864.399 --> 11867.358999999999
soon we've been gone for three hours 15

11866.199 --> 11869.16
minutes

11867.359 --> 11871.84
I'm going to take a minute break and

11869.16 --> 11871.84
I'll be right

11895.76 --> 11898.76
back

11925.72 --> 11928.72
e

11955.72 --> 11959.679999999998
e e

12007.08 --> 12010.08
you

12028.08 --> 12035.52
huh oh you do actual video calls

12032.239 --> 12035.52
together that's

12037.96 --> 12046.08
cool making perfect pancake recipe okay

12041.68 --> 12046.08
Metal Slug Metal slugs cocodile

12052.199 --> 12057.04
yeah make by make sure to come by more

12054.239 --> 12061.399
often I mean I don't know how

12057.04 --> 12064.76
inconvenient my time slot is but

12061.399 --> 12069.519999999999
uh my shows are 2 p.m. Amsterdam time

12064.76 --> 12072.399
every day and so I mean it's a bit later

12069.52 --> 12075.560000000001
than it used to be when I started 1 p.m.

12072.399 --> 12078.56
amster time and I hope to see you around

12075.56 --> 12080.88
here more often I mean

12078.56 --> 12085.56
would be great it's better than just

12080.88 --> 12085.56
dealing with like half trolls all the

12091.88 --> 12099.92
time all right Mr Cheswick thanks for

12094.6 --> 12099.92
popping by and yeah I'll see you around

12111.0 --> 12114.68
bre bra

12113.08 --> 12118.399
needs

12114.68 --> 12119.68
uh whatever you could also just step

12118.399 --> 12126.039999999999
away for a

12119.68 --> 12126.04
minute gas AG but it it's not

12126.8 --> 12131.239
yeah it's all about the timing

12133.92 --> 12140.359
though like if I'm in the middle

12137.16 --> 12142.56
of trying to explain a concept and like

12140.359 --> 12144.199
hey guys what about this and this and

12142.56 --> 12146.439
this consideration what do you think

12144.199 --> 12150.08
could it be that and then somebody's

12146.439 --> 12152.84
like goofy joke well that literally just

12150.08 --> 12156.199
ruins the entire

12152.84 --> 12158.16
process so yeah a break is cool and all

12156.199 --> 12161.439
that but I

12158.16 --> 12165.0
mean maybe do that

12161.439 --> 12168.439
after the explanation is done after it's

12165.0 --> 12168.439
been understood you know

12169.84 --> 12175.399
anti-humor I don't have an anti-humor

12172.16 --> 12175.399
sense it's just goofing

12177.12 --> 12185.199
around doesn't ruin

12180.76 --> 12185.199
anything I don't know it kind of does to

12189.72 --> 12196.64
me it to me joking around is like

12193.8 --> 12198.64
belligerence

12196.64 --> 12200.92
somebody's joking around that literally

12198.64 --> 12203.56
means to me like oh so they really don't

12200.92 --> 12206.84
care what I'm actually talking about but

12203.56 --> 12206.84
they still want the social

12208.319 --> 12211.319
interaction

12211.479 --> 12219.198999999999
yep I'm not anti humor if a joke is

12214.8 --> 12222.72
really funny and appropriate and like on

12219.199 --> 12225.76
target like relevant to the conversation

12222.72 --> 12228.8
and all that yeah that's funny I then I

12225.76 --> 12232.72
laugh out loud out over

12228.8 --> 12235.278999999999
it but if it's just distracting away

12232.72 --> 12240.319
into meaningless

12235.279 --> 12240.319000000001
nonsense that's annoying that's

12242.64 --> 12248.0
distracting and disruptive arguably

12245.6 --> 12250.0
because it will make other people break

12248.0 --> 12253.199
their

12250.0 --> 12256.92
concentration that they're there also so

12253.199 --> 12256.92
it's a tricky thing

12259.319 --> 12263.92
that yeah bet you're right yeah in a

12261.16 --> 12267.399
silent moment gas AG

12263.92 --> 12270.68
exactly if it's like it's a bit still

12267.399 --> 12273.599999999999
well then a a joke can actually get

12270.68 --> 12276.720000000001
things rolling again but it's all about

12273.6 --> 12279.6
the timing and and the intention behind

12276.72 --> 12280.88
it like what is creating that joke in

12279.6 --> 12284.08
that

12280.88 --> 12286.839999999998
moment is it your unwillingness to

12284.08 --> 12290.68
participate in what's going on

12286.84 --> 12292.359
or is it to reinvigorate everybody

12290.68 --> 12294.68
because there's a silent

12292.359 --> 12299.720000000001
moment right what's

12294.68 --> 12302.279
behind the initiation of the joke that

12299.72 --> 12304.72
matters and some people that like to

12302.279 --> 12307.359
visit my chat they only start making

12304.72 --> 12310.16
jokes when I'm in the middle of like

12307.359 --> 12312.640000000001
explaining things so they're always

12310.16 --> 12314.76
disruptive when they do it every damn

12312.64 --> 12318.599999999999
time they're only disruptive when they

12314.76 --> 12321.199
do it and others they're perfect they

12318.6 --> 12323.279
don't joke around when I'm intensely

12321.199 --> 12324.720000000001
explaining things and then if they

12323.279 --> 12327.359
notice like hey there's a bit of a

12324.72 --> 12328.8
silent Moment Like AR win's like kind of

12327.359 --> 12331.640000000001
done and he doesn't really know how to

12328.8 --> 12333.56
continue and then they make a funny joke

12331.64 --> 12335.84
and then that gets things rolling and

12333.56 --> 12335.84
that's

12339.0 --> 12342.0
excellent

12344.08 --> 12350.84
see right you agree good

12348.12 --> 12353.08
so I'm not anti humor it's just like

12350.84 --> 12357.72
what are you doing with

12353.08 --> 12361.64
it right and I mean conspiracy

12357.72 --> 12365.278999999999
cats every damn time he's always goofing

12361.64 --> 12368.84
around and distracting trying to be

12365.279 --> 12371.92
funny when it's like inappropriate when

12368.84 --> 12373.6
I'm not trying to do that and like

12371.92 --> 12376.72
actually trying to create a serious

12373.6 --> 12379.199
subject so every time you can think

12376.72 --> 12381.119999999999
that's funny but he's disruptive you

12379.199 --> 12384.0
recognize that he is disruptive when he

12381.12 --> 12388.08
does that that's what I'm

12384.0 --> 12391.08
addressing he also is not funny well

12388.08 --> 12391.08
yeah

12391.56 --> 12397.039999999999
arguably but that's not even the point

12393.72 --> 12398.92
it's just the timing of it is using

12397.04 --> 12401.52
comedy to

12398.92 --> 12404.56
disrupt instead of to

12401.52 --> 12408.239
reinvigorate and that's

12404.56 --> 12408.239
terrible that's disrup

12408.76 --> 12415.6
so that is the kind of thing that I

12412.72 --> 12417.399
criticize that I'm addressing it's like

12415.6 --> 12419.359
you piss me off because you're being

12417.399 --> 12420.88
disruptive because you're goofing around

12419.359 --> 12423.56
in a moment that I'm trying to get

12420.88 --> 12425.92
people's attention and asking you to

12423.56 --> 12427.72
focus and then goofing around with

12425.92 --> 12430.76
stupid jokes that have nothing to do

12427.72 --> 12433.319
with what is being talked about is

12430.76 --> 12437.08
disruptive and it pisses me off I don't

12433.319 --> 12437.08
appreciate it then

12439.359 --> 12443.08
right anyhow it's

12443.239 --> 12449.8
just it is what it is and hey the whole

12448.52 --> 12452.16
simatic

12449.8 --> 12458.239
architecture was a new subject it

12452.16 --> 12458.239
required some focus and it will be

12458.479 --> 12462.76
readdressed right we will talk about

12460.64 --> 12464.72
that again because it's very relevant

12462.76 --> 12469.84
and there's a lot

12464.72 --> 12469.84
of gems that are hidden in that

12471.279 --> 12476.319000000001
subject who was the chck with Dave well

12474.08 --> 12480.199
why don't you actually watch The Night

12476.319 --> 12482.56
Owl show instead of coming in three and

12480.199 --> 12485.76
a half hours in the early bird show and

12482.56 --> 12488.76

12541.45 --> 12544.499000000002
[Music]

12553.68 --> 12558.720000000001
in right

12556.199 --> 12560.800000000001
so anyway thanks everyone for coming I

12558.72 --> 12564.92

12560.8 --> 12567.8
and having a wide range of conversations

12564.92 --> 12569.8
about all kinds of things and thanks

12567.8 --> 12572.56
again fiber o for the support I really

12569.8 --> 12575.08
appreciate that if anybody else could

12572.56 --> 12577.16
also help me out out there or after

12575.08 --> 12580.96
you've watched the show would be really

12577.16 --> 12582.72
appreciated I I still need more help

12580.96 --> 12585.198999999999
financially in order to get through this

12582.72 --> 12587.599999999999
month so I'm kind of just being early

12585.199 --> 12589.880000000001
with it

12587.6 --> 12593.479000000001
grow grow grow yeah of course also share

12589.88 --> 12595.0
the show and uh Hey share my night owl

12593.479 --> 12597.599999999999
show from

12595.0 --> 12599.64
yesterday I mean the night ow shows are

12597.6 --> 12602.68
very

12599.64 --> 12606.0
sharable and I intend to keep them like

12602.68 --> 12608.52
that so that they'll be like a little

12606.0 --> 12610.359
bit more focused quality overall instead

12608.52 --> 12613.279
of the early bird show which is really

12610.359 --> 12614.92
like an underrun show and so whatever

12613.279 --> 12617.279
happens happens during the early bird

12614.92 --> 12619.960000000001
show sometimes it's great and enervating

12617.279 --> 12622.52
sometimes it's a bit depleted and

12619.96 --> 12624.319
cranky yeah I mean it's just an everyday

12622.52 --> 12627.319000000001
show so that's what's going to happen

12624.319 --> 12629.479
but the night all shows can be more

12627.319 --> 12633.72
focused more

12629.479 --> 12637.679999999998
tight and thereby better to

12633.72 --> 12640.08
share and hey if you hear about somebody

12637.68 --> 12644.399
that might want to partake in a night

12640.08 --> 12647.76
I'll show get on with me yeah make sure

12644.399 --> 12651.278999999999
that they contact me and let let me know

12647.76 --> 12653.72
and then uh that might happen also as

12651.279 --> 12656.92
I'm definitely open for more

12653.72 --> 12658.599999999999
guests and then maybe at some point

12656.92 --> 12660.359
there will be such a list that it could

12658.6 --> 12662.640000000001
be like a weekly

12660.359 --> 12663.84
event that would be pretty interesting

12662.64 --> 12666.64

12663.84 --> 12667.399
