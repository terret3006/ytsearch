[Music]

37.399 --> 41.8
good morning

39.28 --> 44.079
welcome to flat earth early bird number

41.8 --> 45.68
675 i'm your host arwyn

44.079 --> 47.6
and before i start the show please don't

45.68 --> 49.519999999999996
forget to share it on any platform you

47.6 --> 51.120000000000005
didn't fit and if you haven't already

49.52 --> 52.800000000000004
subscribe to my channel and hit the bell

51.12 --> 53.44
notification so you know when i'm going

52.8 --> 56.16
live

53.44 --> 56.718999999999994
just normally 2 pm amsterdam time every

56.16 --> 58.718999999999994
day

56.719 --> 60.480000000000004
and please also do support me through

58.719 --> 62.239000000000004

membership system join button

62.239 --> 66.64
that would be much appreciated yeah

64.879 --> 70.84
sorry for being so late

66.64 --> 73.84
haven't been this late since long time

70.84 --> 76.959
but yeah i'll get to that

73.84 --> 76.959
[Music]

78.08 --> 84.08
the weather is yay

81.759 --> 86.0
it's not so much well you can already

84.08 --> 89.03999999999999
see it's like very thin

86.0 --> 90.64
clouds up there very high up

89.04 --> 92.72000000000001
so it's quite the contrast from

90.64 --> 95.2
yesterday

92.72 --> 96.479
and it's actually kind of nice and sunny

95.2 --> 99.52000000000001
and

96.479 --> 100.72
a little bit of wind here and there it's

99.52 --> 103.119
not super cold

100.72 --> 105.03999999999999
it's not super warm but it is kind of

103.119 --> 108.399
moist

105.04 --> 110.64
so yeah i

108.399 --> 112.799
i got up kind of late although not as

110.64 --> 114.96000000000001
late as if it did for example yesterday

112.799 --> 117.43900000000001
but i decided to go out for groceries

114.96 --> 117.439
quickly

117.68 --> 121.759
and yeah because of that it it just

120.64 --> 123.68
didn't work out and i

121.759 --> 124.799
pretty much arrived two minutes before

123.68 --> 128.239
the show should start

124.799 --> 133.36
and then i had to make tea

128.239 --> 136.4
had to get my illuminati croissant

133.36 --> 138.87900000000002
warm it up and yeah and

136.4 --> 140.08
also take a smoke and yeah so that's why

138.879 --> 143.84
i'm late

140.08 --> 145.68
sorry guys

143.84 --> 149.36
so it's going to be a bit of a short

145.68 --> 149.36
show like 40 minutes

150.48 --> 158.39999999999998
but yeah i'm here so

154.72 --> 160.16
shane hayden in chat new to the channel

158.4 --> 163.59900000000002
hello

160.16 --> 165.92
brand m michael o'rourke tom parker

163.599 --> 168.23899999999998
and obermuco and a no good servant is

165.92 --> 168.23899999999998
around

168.879 --> 176.0
because he's been spamming the link

173.12 --> 176.0
sharing that show

178.239 --> 185.84
minty call you minty really

182.84 --> 185.84
okay

189.519 --> 196.159
like are you a girl because that icon

192.159 --> 196.159
looks pretty much like a beefy man

196.84 --> 199.84
so

200.56 --> 204.08
anyway hey good servant

205.28 --> 209.92
all right yeah can i ask how you uh got

207.84 --> 212.08
to this channel

209.92 --> 213.76
since you're new here i was interested

212.08 --> 217.12
to to find out

213.76 --> 219.44
how you came across my channel

217.12 --> 219.44
hey

224.84 --> 230.4
um

227.84 --> 230.4
anyway

233.599 --> 238.0
yesterday was quite a blast and a koala

252.84 --> 255.84
hmm

256.56 --> 269.84
okay your turn

270.16 --> 274.24
right anyway um yeah the flare debate

273.68 --> 276.8
was good

274.24 --> 278.24
yesterday although i don't think i was

276.8 --> 282.8
present

278.24 --> 284.40000000000003
a lot was i because i think i went out

282.8 --> 285.68
for groceries and when i came back it

284.4 --> 289.12
was already over

285.68 --> 292.479
it just happens more often but

289.12 --> 295.6
uh later

292.479 --> 295.59999999999997
oh yeah in the night

295.68 --> 302.32
there was rodrigo stream again

298.72 --> 303.199
he does streams every day and this time

302.32 --> 305.68
it was like

303.199 --> 307.91900000000004
he was reviewing this talk between these

305.68 --> 307.919
two

308.24 --> 312.639
between these two people and they really

310.32 --> 315.44
put out like these

312.639 --> 317.44
secret space program stories and

315.44 --> 319.84
illusions of the moon and like

317.44 --> 322.24
they went all over the place catalog the

319.84 --> 325.28
entire aliens of

322.24 --> 328.56
the reptoids and

325.28 --> 331.75899999999996
oh god it was it was quite a

328.56 --> 334.96
quite a play they put down and yeah

331.759 --> 335.84000000000003
rodrigo reviewed that it was quite

334.96 --> 340.63899999999995
hilarious

335.84 --> 343.28
to watch it to make comment on it

340.639 --> 345.68
and agm was kept spamming in there again

343.28 --> 352.88
like ah they are all cih

345.68 --> 355.039
yeah yeah yeah calm down agm we know

352.88 --> 357.52
[Music]

355.039 --> 357.52
okay

362.639 --> 365.68
you have been into the flat earth

364.56 --> 368.56
community

365.68 --> 369.52
for some time you're not actually a

368.56 --> 372.639
fully

369.52 --> 373.039
fledged flat earther closer to a global

372.639 --> 376.08
fl

373.039 --> 378.0
that you gotta explain to me what that

376.08 --> 380.24
means actually

378.0 --> 381.68
because that you're sort of on the fence

380.24 --> 386.0
but you're interested like

381.68 --> 388.72
why are you sticking

386.0 --> 390.24
to like are you it like do you have a

388.72 --> 392.88000000000005
feeling there is something there

390.24 --> 394.639
do you know there is some a lot of wrong

392.88 --> 396.24
with the globe earth community is that

394.639 --> 399.52
the reason

396.24 --> 402.319
what is compelling you to

399.52 --> 402.31899999999996
to check it out

402.8 --> 407.039
at least from your own perspective

407.44 --> 410.319
nothing to learn

410.96 --> 416.4
oh god mr jones

414.24 --> 418.479
yeah excuse mr jones here he's a

416.4 --> 419.919
fanatical religious globe earther i

418.479 --> 421.35999999999996
think it's the cover for somebody else

419.919 --> 423.75899999999996
but i'm not sure

421.36 --> 426.24
he's quite fanatical and you can argue

423.759 --> 429.599
continuously but in the end he will

426.24 --> 429.599
just at home

432.319 --> 437.84000000000003
yeah you are religious mr jones you are

446.08 --> 449.75899999999996
there's a lot wrong with both sides like

448.08 --> 450.71999999999997
what what's wrong with the flat earth

449.759 --> 453.36
side

450.72 --> 453.36
you tell me

455.759 --> 458.8
not all flat earthers have the same

457.759 --> 462.639
opinions

458.8 --> 466.16
well are you talking about character

462.639 --> 470.319
because yeah sure plenty of people have

466.16 --> 471.84000000000003
character traits that are their own

470.319 --> 473.599
that technically doesn't have anything

471.84 --> 475.28
to do with flat earth it just

473.599 --> 476.8
that's what drives them and that's what

475.28 --> 480.15999999999997
will be

476.8 --> 482.8
part of what they show of themselves

480.16 --> 485.36
their performance and their direction

482.8 --> 489.68
they're taking their strategies even

485.36 --> 492.40000000000003
so but that has nothing to do really

489.68 --> 495.47
with the technicals

492.4 --> 495.46999999999997
[Music]

496.319 --> 500.24
you don't get why there is a pressure

498.0 --> 502.8
gradient well because of relative

500.24 --> 502.8
density

503.919 --> 508.87899999999996
pressure gradients can even be

505.68 --> 514.32
demonstrated on the small scale

508.879 --> 514.32
shane you do realize that right

516.479 --> 520.159
yeah mr jones stop interfering you're

519.599 --> 522.159
annoying

520.159 --> 523.76
i'm gonna time you out if you if you

522.159 --> 535.4399999999999
continue this

523.76 --> 538.16
having a civil conversation here

535.44 --> 539.2790000000001
no not all flat earthers believe in the

538.16 --> 541.12
dome because

539.279 --> 545.519
when you use the word dome you're

541.12 --> 549.44
already implying a specific geometry

545.519 --> 552.08
to the enclosure and there is no direct

549.44 --> 552.08
proof for that

554.16 --> 561.12
so the dome no definitely

557.279 --> 562.72
but what is agreed upon widely and or

561.12 --> 564.0
if there's flat earth that don't agree

562.72 --> 564.5600000000001
upon that then they haven't thought

564.0 --> 566.72
about it

564.56 --> 568.64
and that is because we have gas pressure

566.72 --> 571.12
in the first instant

568.64 --> 572.959
there has to be a limited volume a

571.12 --> 577.839
limited amount of space

572.959 --> 577.8389999999999
for that gas in order to find

578.16 --> 582.48
the yeah to meet the limits of the

580.959 --> 584.959
container expand in all directions to

582.48 --> 588.24
meet the limit of the container and then

584.959 --> 591.8389999999999
secondary form a gradient because of

588.24 --> 591.839
relative density

592.0 --> 597.279
so that's really how that works

595.6 --> 599.6
there is gas pressure right here so

597.279 --> 605.8389999999999
there has to be

599.6 --> 605.839
a container that is limited

616.839 --> 619.839
so

623.76 --> 627.92
do you understand what i just explained

625.6 --> 627.9200000000001
shane

629.2 --> 634.0
what is the name again minty

647.839 --> 652.1600000000001
yeah sean hill mr jones is just ball

650.64 --> 654.399
squirting right now because

652.16 --> 655.4399999999999
there is no difference it's just word

654.399 --> 658.88
play

655.44 --> 663.0400000000001
it's just getting more sphere words

658.88 --> 663.04
into the vernacular that's what that is

666.16 --> 668.399
if

671.12 --> 677.12
no no that's wrong shaden shane

674.16 --> 678.8
minty look that's that's literally a

677.12 --> 681.839
rumor that's a rumor that's

678.8 --> 685.92
absolutely wrong gravity

681.839 --> 688.1600000000001
even the mechanisms behind gravity

685.92 --> 690.4799999999999
whether you even take the old-fashioned

688.16 --> 692.24
more colloquial version of gravity which

690.48 --> 693.76
is the newtonian mechanics for which

692.24 --> 695.6800000000001
newton by the way never claimed the

693.76 --> 697.6
hypothesis for his gravitation you got

695.68 --> 698.64
to realize that that is a historical

697.6 --> 701.9200000000001
fact

698.64 --> 704.64
so it is purely conceptual but the

701.92 --> 707.8389999999999
newtonian's mechanics gravity

704.64 --> 710.8
is very weak and could never

707.839 --> 712.48
prevent the gas pressure from expanding

710.8 --> 716.399
in all directions

712.48 --> 719.2
into a endless volume

716.399 --> 720.24
which would bring endless expansion

719.2 --> 722.48
power

720.24 --> 725.04
cannot be stopped by any force not even

722.48 --> 727.519
a black hole level gravity

725.04 --> 729.279
cuts up the gas pressure from expanding

727.519 --> 731.12
in all directions seriously that's how

729.279 --> 734.32
the calculations work out

731.12 --> 735.839
right but if you then go by the official

734.32 --> 737.6800000000001
narrative and that is einsteinian

735.839 --> 740.8000000000001
gravity it's not even a force so

737.68 --> 741.76
how is the not even force supposed to

740.8 --> 743.1999999999999
prevent gas

741.76 --> 746.0
pressure from expanding in all

743.2 --> 746.8000000000001
directions it won't it just doesn't even

746.0 --> 748.959
address it

746.8 --> 750.24
it just distracts you from thinking

748.959 --> 753.5189999999999
about

750.24 --> 755.92
how do things work out in this model

753.519 --> 759.04
that's what it is it's a parlor trick to

755.92 --> 760.959
kind of distract you

759.04 --> 762.88
that's literally what it is that's what

760.959 --> 765.8389999999999
it's designed for

762.88 --> 767.4399999999999
take you out of the really is level

765.839 --> 768.8800000000001
that's what einstein did with this

767.44 --> 771.839
conception

768.88 --> 772.399
with the pseudo-romanian force base not

771.839 --> 775.36
actual

772.399 --> 775.36
physical reality

776.24 --> 782.24
right so yeah gravity

779.68 --> 785.279
no matter how you conceive it it is

782.24 --> 788.48
never been conceived in any way

785.279 --> 789.12
to be able to mechanically even in a

788.48 --> 791.519
model

789.12 --> 793.6
prevent the gas pressure from expanding

791.519 --> 795.279
in all directions the only way to do

793.6 --> 798.72
that even virtually

795.279 --> 802.079
is by creating a barrier or just

798.72 --> 804.639
yeah effectively a barrier

802.079 --> 808.7199999999999
and then just don't mention it don't

804.639 --> 808.72
show it it's just a virtual barrier

809.6 --> 815.839
that is effectively the the container

813.2 --> 817.6800000000001
but it's just kind of not mentioned but

815.839 --> 820.5600000000001
that is what they use to

817.68 --> 822.079
to even emulate things if they're

820.56 --> 824.399
actually trying to emulate

822.079 --> 825.279
some gas situation which they rarely do

824.399 --> 827.44
you know

825.279 --> 828.959
the whole gas part is completely left

827.44 --> 832.72
out of the modeling

828.959 --> 835.8389999999999
it's just not really a part of the model

832.72 --> 838.399
and in the graphics it isn't either they

835.839 --> 838.399
don't care

838.72 --> 843.839
because it doesn't work out

845.199 --> 848.7199999999999
so does that clear up something

848.88 --> 852.48
shane minty

853.12 --> 857.839
gravity isn't real because it's actually

856.0 --> 861.279
a reification fallacy of

857.839 --> 861.2790000000001
relative density theory

862.16 --> 866.56
and density differential law

868.8 --> 872.399
but even through the conceptions of what

870.959 --> 875.3599999999999
gravity is supposed to be

872.399 --> 875.68
in the math and in the model it even

875.36 --> 878.24
then

875.68 --> 879.519
is not capable of preventing the gas

878.24 --> 880.48
pressure from expanding in all

879.519 --> 885.199
directions

880.48 --> 887.519
into the endless volume of outer space

885.199 --> 887.519
alright

893.77 --> 900.959
[Music]

896.48 --> 904.639
right so now maybe you see that

900.959 --> 907.4399999999999
yeah flat earth

904.639 --> 908.48
the flat earth side is much more well

907.44 --> 910.8800000000001
developed

908.48 --> 913.839
and stricter to the disciplines of

910.88 --> 913.8389999999999
physics

914.8 --> 920.3199999999999
and we have a group of people

918.16 --> 921.279
that are very good at physics to thank

920.32 --> 924.839
for that

921.279 --> 926.48
for sticking together and figuring this

924.839 --> 928.5600000000001
out

926.48 --> 930.8000000000001
and i like to think i'm part of that

928.56 --> 930.8
group

931.68 --> 934.76
[Music]

938.959 --> 946.4799999999999
the thread count on that space fabric ah

942.32 --> 955.839
thank you that's a that's very poetic

946.48 --> 955.839
i love that

962.639 --> 966.399
if gravity was strong enough for instead

965.04 --> 967.68
could it be considered strong enough to

966.399 --> 969.839
hold the atmosphere

967.68 --> 972.16
well that's i i already answered that

969.839 --> 974.0
question minty but

972.16 --> 976.0
it's it's okay you're asking it again

974.0 --> 978.0
because this is all pretty

976.0 --> 979.199
condensed tough material if you're not

978.0 --> 982.0
used to it you might not

979.199 --> 983.5999999999999
completely absorb it all right away in a

982.0 --> 986.88
logical order in your mind

983.6 --> 989.36
so i'll repeat that no

986.88 --> 990.48
there is no conceivable way in which

989.36 --> 993.92
gravity

990.48 --> 995.12
which is like a field type that's how

993.92 --> 997.279
you model it

995.12 --> 998.639
field type that just pushes or pulls

997.279 --> 1002.16
towards one direction

998.639 --> 1003.759
this like a universal displacement field

1002.16 --> 1005.4399999999999
that's gonna push well no matter how

1003.759 --> 1008.9590000000001
strong it's gonna push

1005.44 --> 1008.9590000000001
we're dealing with gas here

1009.279 --> 1015.4399999999999
so that gas is going to expand in all

1013.44 --> 1017.1990000000001
directions no matter what it even does

1015.44 --> 1020.32
in a vacuum you have to

1017.199 --> 1021.7589999999999
have a balloon to contain it in order

1020.32 --> 1025.199
for the whole thing to drop

1021.759 --> 1027.839
down in a vacuum chamber because

1025.199 --> 1029.6000000000001
if there was no balloon there's no way

1027.839 --> 1031.52
you could get the gas to go

1029.6 --> 1034.559
down versus the rest of the vacuum

1031.52 --> 1034.559
that's not possible

1034.72 --> 1040.48
so no even like

1038.079 --> 1042.3999999999999
even if the earth had like and this is

1040.48 --> 1042.799
this is taking things way out of whack

1042.4 --> 1044.24
because

1042.799 --> 1047.36
other things are supposed to happen

1044.24 --> 1050.48
right but even if the earth had gravity

1047.36 --> 1052.8799999999999
of black hole level without in

1050.48 --> 1053.919
it crushing and turning into an actual

1052.88 --> 1057.2
black hole but like

1053.919 --> 1059.2
insane gravity and we would somehow be

1057.2 --> 1062.4
able to survive we would be

1059.2 --> 1064.8400000000001
evolved to withhold that strength

1062.4 --> 1066.0800000000002
on a cellular level this very ridiculous

1064.84 --> 1070.0
sci-fi

1066.08 --> 1073.4399999999998
even that strength of gravity

1070.0 --> 1077.6
could not prevent the gas pressure

1073.44 --> 1081.76
from still expanding in all directions

1077.6 --> 1084.3999999999999
because and this is why because

1081.76 --> 1085.039
the amount of volume it is trying to

1084.4 --> 1088.64
escape

1085.039 --> 1092.8799999999999
into is literally officially

1088.64 --> 1095.8400000000001
endless the volume is infinite

1092.88 --> 1097.919
when the volume is infinite that means

1095.84 --> 1098.799
that the power of the gas pressure

1097.919 --> 1102.16
expansion

1098.799 --> 1104.24
is going to be equally infinite well

1102.16 --> 1106.16
a black hole does not have infinite

1104.24 --> 1108.88
gravity it just has to

1106.16 --> 1110.4
has supposedly astronomical insane

1108.88 --> 1113.679
levels of gravity

1110.4 --> 1117.76
that's not infinite so yes

1113.679 --> 1120.96
theoretically i've conceived

1117.76 --> 1122.8799999999999
that in the model even black hole levels

1120.96 --> 1125.919
of gravity could not prevent

1122.88 --> 1128.96
the gas from escaping all

1125.919 --> 1128.96
into outer space

1129.44 --> 1133.919
obviously we only have earth levels of

1132.88 --> 1136.3200000000002
gravity

1133.919 --> 1138.3200000000002
so it's just a purely theoretical

1136.32 --> 1141.84
concept but just to show you

1138.32 --> 1146.1599999999999
how futile it is for the ballers

1141.84 --> 1147.9189999999999
to try and put something together to

1146.16 --> 1149.1200000000001
explain how gas pressure can stick to

1147.919 --> 1152.4
ball earth versus the

1149.12 --> 1155.6789999999999
infinite vacuum of space it is

1152.4 --> 1158.4
such a futile attempt

1155.679 --> 1160.0
yet they hold on to it by not addressing

1158.4 --> 1163.2
it

1160.0 --> 1164.72
by not thinking about it too clearly by

1163.2 --> 1168.24
trying to

1164.72 --> 1168.64
misinterpret the rules and then bypass

1168.24 --> 1171.36
it

1168.64 --> 1173.6000000000001
that's what they do that's what ballers

1171.36 --> 1173.6
do

1176.84 --> 1183.52
hmm

1179.6 --> 1185.28
right well shane hayden the whole

1183.52 --> 1188.08
the whole thing about what i've been

1185.28 --> 1188.8799999999999
sharing is emphasizing the error in the

1188.08 --> 1192.08
assumption of

1188.88 --> 1194.16
infinite space that completely breaks

1192.08 --> 1196.48
every mechanic concerning the gas

1194.16 --> 1198.88
pressure expansion everything

1196.48 --> 1200.72
so yes there has to be a limited amount

1198.88 --> 1204.64
of space

1200.72 --> 1206.0
there must must be a limited amount of

1204.64 --> 1209.1200000000001
space in order for gas

1206.0 --> 1211.28
pressure to be able to exist in other

1209.12 --> 1214.0
words there has to be a container of

1211.28 --> 1214.0
some kind

1218.4 --> 1223.44
a good servant it doesn't matter you'd

1220.72 --> 1223.44
what are you doing

1224.0 --> 1230.72
it it doesn't matter gravity

1227.679 --> 1231.76
is just a relative density that's what

1230.72 --> 1233.919
it's based on but

1231.76 --> 1236.32
it's based on the look dude i'm talking

1233.919 --> 1239.8400000000001
about presupposing earth being a ball

1236.32 --> 1242.6789999999999
in space right i'm going there

1239.84 --> 1244.72
you can go there i'm just going into the

1242.679 --> 1248.48
presuppositional mechanics

1244.72 --> 1252.32
to show where it is broken

1248.48 --> 1254.159
i'm like a surgeon opening up that wound

1252.32 --> 1256.559
and just going in there and showed no

1254.159 --> 1258.64
look the wounds are not just superficial

1256.559 --> 1259.84
there's internal damage look here and

1258.64 --> 1263.8400000000001
there and there that's all

1259.84 --> 1263.84
that's what i'm doing here

1264.72 --> 1266.96
see

1268.4 --> 1271.6000000000001
it's like no this patient definitely

1270.48 --> 1274.32
cannot recover

1271.6 --> 1277.84
because he has for severe intern like

1274.32 --> 1277.84
fatal internal damage

1278.08 --> 1284.799
lungs are all it's all yeah

1281.44 --> 1284.799
all cut up

1287.36 --> 1293.6789999999999
can't breathe literally no gas pressure

1290.24 --> 1293.679
ability no container

1294.09 --> 1299.36
[Music]

1296.32 --> 1303.28
yeah patient ball earth is doomed

1299.36 --> 1304.08
absolutely oh probably he's technically

1303.28 --> 1307.52
already dead

1304.08 --> 1319.84
it's just being kept alive artificially

1307.52 --> 1319.84
my people's hopes and dreams

1320.159 --> 1325.44
it's like a frankenstein monster that

1323.28 --> 1327.039
seemed to live for just a few moments

1325.44 --> 1328.159
but then he died again and everybody's

1327.039 --> 1333.84
just hoping he's come

1328.159 --> 1333.8400000000001
to come come back up

1340.48 --> 1345.679
so all gases are recycled so their

1343.2 --> 1348.4
pressure never overloads

1345.679 --> 1349.52
well there is a there's always pressure

1348.4 --> 1353.44
dynamics happening

1349.52 --> 1355.84
even plant life is full of pressure

1353.44 --> 1358.3200000000002
dynamics which means

1355.84 --> 1359.12
it's like a it everything could be

1358.32 --> 1361.9189999999999
considered

1359.12 --> 1363.1999999999998
pressure valve systems and mechanics

1361.919 --> 1365.039
everything

1363.2 --> 1366.24
and it is like okay there's basically

1365.039 --> 1367.76
sensors everywhere

1366.24 --> 1369.44
that when a certain pressure in

1367.76 --> 1371.919
proximity

1369.44 --> 1374.24
pressures it it triggers a release the

1371.919 --> 1375.5200000000002
pressure is depressurized another part

1374.24 --> 1378.559
is pressurized

1375.52 --> 1380.48
and that's like everything everything

1378.559 --> 1385.6
works like that

1380.48 --> 1385.6
plants or yeah

1386.84 --> 1390.9599999999998
animals

1388.88 --> 1393.1200000000001
so yeah there is an enclosed system it's

1390.96 --> 1395.3600000000001
pressurized and there are mechanics

1393.12 --> 1398.2399999999998
happening that will

1395.36 --> 1399.6789999999999
respond to the changes of pressure

1398.24 --> 1403.2
locally

1399.679 --> 1406.4
and probably in the entire thing as well

1403.2 --> 1410.32
there might be like yeah

1406.4 --> 1411.919
uh non-earthly mechanisms

1410.32 --> 1413.84
like part of the design part of the

1411.919 --> 1416.159
realm design like sensories

1413.84 --> 1419.84
that will simply respond like okay these

1416.159 --> 1422.159
conditions have now arrived that means

1419.84 --> 1423.76
switch to the next system or something

1422.159 --> 1425.7600000000002
you know

1423.76 --> 1427.279
could consider pressure could consider

1425.76 --> 1430.08
moist level could consider

1427.279 --> 1431.6
i don't know electricity in the air

1430.08 --> 1433.279
levels

1431.6 --> 1434.8799999999999
you know oh it's going down to this

1433.279 --> 1437.6
level that means now

1434.88 --> 1438.3200000000002
trigger this mechanism or that mechanism

1437.6 --> 1440.24
see

1438.32 --> 1442.72
it's there could be all kinds of things

1440.24 --> 1444.72
happening as part of the realms design

1442.72 --> 1448.0
but what is absolutely certain

1444.72 --> 1451.679
is that it's a limited volume within

1448.0 --> 1451.679
a container somehow

1451.919 --> 1455.679
because we have gas pressure and a gas

1453.84 --> 1458.6399999999999
pressure gradient and there could never

1455.679 --> 1461.52
have been gas pressure gradients

1458.64 --> 1464.0
if the gas pressure was unable to expand

1461.52 --> 1465.76
in all directions and then finally

1464.0 --> 1468.159
meet the limits of the container in

1465.76 --> 1471.6
order to settle and then form a

1468.159 --> 1473.919
gas pressure gradient because if it's

1471.6 --> 1477.279
going to expand in all directions

1473.919 --> 1479.0
then a gradient could never form because

1477.279 --> 1482.0
all the gas all of it is going to

1479.0 --> 1484.96
uniformly

1482.0 --> 1486.96
spread out just uniformly spread out

1484.96 --> 1488.72
that is how gas pressure expands in all

1486.96 --> 1490.159
directions within the container when

1488.72 --> 1493.44
it's presented with the

1490.159 --> 1493.44
evacuated space

1493.52 --> 1498.32
it's uniformly it's not just the top of

1496.08 --> 1499.1999999999998
it leaks off and the rest just sits

1498.32 --> 1502.32
there no

1499.2 --> 1505.279
the entire volume is going to uniformly

1502.32 --> 1506.799
the gradient analogy could expand

1505.279 --> 1509.6
uniformly

1506.799 --> 1511.12
on the bottom and on top that's what

1509.6 --> 1513.6789999999999
happens that's how

1511.12 --> 1516.799
that works it's not just the top of it

1513.679 --> 1516.799
starts to leak off

1518.08 --> 1531.4399999999998
that's not how it works

1528.799 --> 1534.1589999999999
any opinions on other planets ooh

1531.44 --> 1534.159
exciting

1534.559 --> 1539.2
yeah well i think the planets are not

1537.36 --> 1541.84
physical bodies they are not

1539.2 --> 1544.559
other planets like earth this is i'm

1541.84 --> 1546.0
talking flat earth again now

1544.559 --> 1549.12
because i'm not going to presuppose

1546.0 --> 1551.36
their balls that's ridiculous

1549.12 --> 1552.799
now i think they're just celestial light

1551.36 --> 1554.559
i think

1552.799 --> 1556.24
the appearance of what you get to see

1554.559 --> 1559.52
when you look through a telescope

1556.24 --> 1560.799
or camera and ones that aren't tampered

1559.52 --> 1563.12
with

1560.799 --> 1564.559
because there is some weird fidgeting

1563.12 --> 1567.9189999999999
going on as well

1564.559 --> 1567.9189999999999
from astronomy side

1568.32 --> 1571.76
uh yeah they're like holographic

1570.799 --> 1575.36
signatures

1571.76 --> 1579.6
of light it's like a light beam

1575.36 --> 1582.32
in that shape and but not literally that

1579.6 --> 1584.7199999999998
shape from a side on

1582.32 --> 1585.52
thing it's just like every single light

1584.72 --> 1588.72
beam has

1585.52 --> 1591.44
that as a signature

1588.72 --> 1593.44
and so that's what you see when you look

1591.44 --> 1594.48
in that specific direction from which

1593.44 --> 1597.039
that light count

1594.48 --> 1600.32
comes it's the only way i know how to

1597.039 --> 1603.12
explain the holographic nature of it

1600.32 --> 1604.24
and this by the way includes the sun and

1603.12 --> 1607.52
all of its light

1604.24 --> 1610.48
which i state

1607.52 --> 1611.76
that the entire sunlight projection is

1610.48 --> 1614.72
unique

1611.76 --> 1615.84
the way it shines on everything as you

1614.72 --> 1618.72
see it

1615.84 --> 1619.6
that specific way is unique to you as a

1618.72 --> 1622.799
viewer

1619.6 --> 1625.279
because if you see the sunlight even if

1622.799 --> 1628.96
the person is not that far away

1625.279 --> 1631.12
if you see it hitting somebody else

1628.96 --> 1632.88
the way you see the light hitting them

1631.12 --> 1636.2399999999998
is going to be slightly different

1632.88 --> 1636.72
then they will see the light hitting

1636.24 --> 1641.279
them

1636.72 --> 1643.76
from their perspective their son

1641.279 --> 1645.76
that's yeah and this thing becomes more

1643.76 --> 1649.039
apparent when the distance between

1645.76 --> 1651.919
observers becomes very vast and there's

1649.039 --> 1654.32
like clouds in the sky because

1651.919 --> 1655.3600000000001
one individual might have might see the

1654.32 --> 1657.52
sun and then

1655.36 --> 1659.36
it being slightly behind clouds and

1657.52 --> 1660.08
there's like these beams coming down you

1659.36 --> 1662.0
know

1660.08 --> 1664.08
everybody's seen that one time or

1662.0 --> 1665.84
another and then the beams can even hit

1664.08 --> 1668.799
you very hit the ground to you

1665.84 --> 1669.4399999999998
very close very close you could almost

1668.799 --> 1672.0
grab it

1669.44 --> 1672.559
but it's of course light it's like this

1672.0 --> 1674.08
spot

1672.559 --> 1675.6
of light it can even move with the

1674.08 --> 1677.4399999999998
clouds and all that right

1675.6 --> 1679.4399999999998
well another observer that's standing on

1677.44 --> 1682.88
a mountain say

1679.44 --> 1685.679
several kilometers away

1682.88 --> 1687.8400000000001
like 10 kilometers away and looks down

1685.679 --> 1688.96
upon that first individual that looks at

1687.84 --> 1692.48
the light spots

1688.96 --> 1696.24
in front of him like with it with a

1692.48 --> 1698.3990000000001
zoomed in camera very carefully well

1696.24 --> 1700.72
he will see that under individual but he

1698.399 --> 1702.399
will not see those light spots right in

1700.72 --> 1704.72
front of him

1702.399 --> 1706.0
and you know why because to that

1704.72 --> 1710.24
individual

1706.0 --> 1713.12
the sun is not behind those clouds

1710.24 --> 1713.6
that the first viewer saw the sun behind

1713.12 --> 1715.52
and

1713.6 --> 1717.6
the it causing the beams and all that

1715.52 --> 1719.12
well the first the second individual on

1717.6 --> 1721.039
the mountain

1719.12 --> 1723.1999999999998
the sun is just out in the open to them

1721.039 --> 1724.08
and the cloud is in the distance but

1723.2 --> 1725.8400000000001
it's not behind

1724.08 --> 1728.799
those clouds so when he looks at the

1725.84 --> 1728.799
first individual

1728.96 --> 1734.48
it's just all of the sun is just hitting

1730.96 --> 1738.72
him and the ground

1734.48 --> 1742.159
for example there's no beams in front of

1738.72 --> 1744.72
him it will not look like that

1742.159 --> 1746.3990000000001
the beams if if they will be visible at

1744.72 --> 1748.24
all would be in an other spot

1746.399 --> 1749.6789999999999
because the clouds in relation to that

1748.24 --> 1752.3990000000001
observer's sun

1749.679 --> 1753.039
are in another angle see it's it gets

1752.399 --> 1755.6
very

1753.039 --> 1756.64
weird that way but there's already

1755.6 --> 1758.559
testimony

1756.64 --> 1766.64
of people that have witnessed this

1758.559 --> 1780.1589999999999
unique holographic effect it is kind of

1766.64 --> 1781.679
surreal when you think about it

1780.159 --> 1783.2
right but yeah that makes it a little

1781.679 --> 1785.1200000000001
bit more complex probably

1783.2 --> 1787.3600000000001
in relation to the gas pressure in the

1785.12 --> 1790.0
container argument

1787.36 --> 1791.84
because uh yeah and it's probably not

1790.0 --> 1792.88
very popular amongst flat earthers

1791.84 --> 1795.4399999999998
because

1792.88 --> 1796.24
if you're gonna say hey the lights and

1795.44 --> 1798.559
even the sun

1796.24 --> 1800.3990000000001
itself is like holographic it's not a

1798.559 --> 1801.12
real physical thing in a specific

1800.399 --> 1805.039
position

1801.12 --> 1806.32
spatially then yeah that weirds out a

1805.039 --> 1809.2
lot of people because of

1806.32 --> 1810.48
physicality assumption bias or as nathan

1809.2 --> 1813.0
likes to call it

1810.48 --> 1815.279
physical assumption bias it's

1813.0 --> 1818.559
physicality

1815.279 --> 1821.279
it's physicalness not just

1818.559 --> 1823.52
physical it's not the assumption bias is

1821.279 --> 1826.559
not physical

1823.52 --> 1829.9189999999999
the assumption bias is

1826.559 --> 1830.32
directed at physicality which is what

1829.919 --> 1834.5590000000002
the

1830.32 --> 1834.559
conscious wants it's easy

1835.2 --> 1838.24
so it's physicality assumption bias that

1837.2 --> 1840.159
makes it very

1838.24 --> 1841.44
unappealing to imagine that it's all

1840.159 --> 1843.679
just holographic and

1841.44 --> 1845.919
very confusing it's tougher to engage at

1843.679 --> 1845.919
that

1846.08 --> 1852.399
people want to think they are balls

1849.2 --> 1854.559
or at least lights like candles that are

1852.399 --> 1857.36
in a very specific spot

1854.559 --> 1858.8799999999999
because otherwise it's just very it just

1857.36 --> 1865.6
becomes like painfully

1858.88 --> 1869.679
difficult to try to imagine what it is

1865.6 --> 1869.6789999999999
but i've had a lot of practice with this

1872.88 --> 1876.5590000000002
how can hologram give heat well it's

1875.679 --> 1879.279
still light

1876.559 --> 1881.44
that's how it's very strong light and

1879.279 --> 1883.12
whether it is of a holographic nature or

1881.44 --> 1887.039
not

1883.12 --> 1890.32
it is the light itself is real

1887.039 --> 1893.12
it does arrive it

1890.32 --> 1894.399
is absorbed at ground level there's just

1893.12 --> 1897.4399999999998
weird

1894.399 --> 1900.1589999999999
effects going on

1897.44 --> 1902.0
like what i said so first person may

1900.159 --> 1903.7600000000002
have sunlight hitting them

1902.0 --> 1905.279
from one perspective and not from

1903.76 --> 1907.36
another perspective

1905.279 --> 1908.799
but the only perspective that really

1907.36 --> 1912.0
counts effectively

1908.799 --> 1913.519
is their own if they feel they are in

1912.0 --> 1915.679
the shadow versus the sun

1913.519 --> 1917.44
then they will not feel the sun heat

1915.679 --> 1920.3200000000002
even though as somebody else

1917.44 --> 1921.1200000000001
might see them right into the sunlight

1920.32 --> 1923.519
it's so

1921.12 --> 1923.5189999999998
weird

1924.559 --> 1927.36
so yeah

1927.6 --> 1938.559
that's how i conceive it

1935.279 --> 1940.24
but yeah the planets they're wandering

1938.559 --> 1942.559
stars that's how they were originally

1940.24 --> 1942.559
named

1943.2 --> 1947.039
and then they became planets and then

1945.039 --> 1947.36
earth became a planet and then oh it's

1947.039 --> 1950.2
all

1947.36 --> 1953.1999999999998
balls floating around the sun and that's

1950.2 --> 1953.2
heliocentrism

1954.159 --> 1957.6000000000001
but yeah they're they're just lights and

1956.159 --> 1960.72
they have very specific

1957.6 --> 1962.559
influences specific type of looks that

1960.72 --> 1965.44
are unique but also there is

1962.559 --> 1966.72
yeah there's a lot of spiritual mystery

1965.44 --> 1968.96
like the

1966.72 --> 1971.039
there's a thing like how you feel in a

1968.96 --> 1973.679
certain moment what type of energy you

1971.039 --> 1976.799
have available what the tendencies are

1973.679 --> 1977.6000000000001
of your person depends a lot on the

1976.799 --> 1979.76
energy

1977.6 --> 1981.6
that is present like how does this feel

1979.76 --> 1985.519
like for example this

1981.6 --> 1987.9189999999999
nice sunniness with relatively clear sky

1985.519 --> 1989.2
gives to me like a lot of sun

1987.919 --> 1992.24
frequencies like

1989.2 --> 1992.24
clarity and

1992.559 --> 2000.0
and not so much frustration

1996.96 --> 2002.559
so it has a specific frequency well

2000.0 --> 2004.96
it is said and i've kind of experienced

2002.559 --> 2008.0
it as well that the planets

2004.96 --> 2010.3990000000001
those specific lights and of course the

2008.0 --> 2012.08
sun but it's very obvious because it has

2010.399 --> 2013.6789999999999
like palpable influences it

2012.08 --> 2017.36
yeah helps growth and all that

2013.679 --> 2021.279
determines growth cycles of plants

2017.36 --> 2025.12
but even the planet influences

2021.279 --> 2028.159
seem to have yeah a mapped out

2025.12 --> 2031.1999999999998
set of effects they have on

2028.159 --> 2034.48
how people and animals including and

2031.2 --> 2037.279
all life how it responds so there

2034.48 --> 2039.84
that's where the astrology comes from

2037.279 --> 2043.279
and there is something to that

2039.84 --> 2046.08
but it's also very easy to call to

2043.279 --> 2047.6
just make something convoluted with that

2046.08 --> 2050.879
as well

2047.6 --> 2053.44
to just turn it into blabbering nonsense

2050.879 --> 2056.3199999999997
but if you're very careful and you take

2053.44 --> 2058.32
it very serious

2056.32 --> 2059.839
and yeah and you're not just there to

2058.32 --> 2061.839
tell a good story

2059.839 --> 2063.52
then yeah you can use the knowledge of

2061.839 --> 2065.52
astrology to

2063.52 --> 2068.32
figure out what good timings are for

2065.52 --> 2071.04
certain types of actions

2068.32 --> 2072.839
this and yeah this is even what the what

2071.04 --> 2076.24
the controlling elite do

2072.839 --> 2078.7999999999997
because like they have to

2076.24 --> 2079.919
do it as good as they can whatever

2078.8 --> 2082.32
they're doing

2079.919 --> 2084.56
because it's all very tense and there's

2082.32 --> 2086.7200000000003
a lot of

2084.56 --> 2088.32
yeah things gonna happen one way or the

2086.72 --> 2092.1589999999997
other and yeah so they

2088.32 --> 2094.3990000000003
a lot of them have their astrologers

2092.159 --> 2095.2000000000003
because they want to find the perfect

2094.399 --> 2097.5989999999997
timing to

2095.2 --> 2099.04
enroll a certain plan or to seduce or

2097.599 --> 2101.3590000000004
you see

2099.04 --> 2104.24
because there are influences and that's

2101.359 --> 2107.04
all because of these mysterious

2104.24 --> 2108.64
specific celestial lights the wandering

2107.04 --> 2117.839
stars the planets

2108.64 --> 2117.839
and their positions in the heavens

2118.88 --> 2123.469
right

2120.39 --> 2123.469
[Music]

2125.2 --> 2131.68
sun's magnetic field oh really so which

2128.079 --> 2134.96
magnetic field is that

2131.68 --> 2134.96
solar storms

2135.599 --> 2141.599
that's that's all

2138.72 --> 2142.3199999999997
science fiction nonsense that's like

2141.599 --> 2144.8
this

2142.32 --> 2145.6800000000003
what do you call that the vernacular all

2144.8 --> 2149.04
given two

2145.68 --> 2150.0
yeah interesting phenomena that may be

2149.04 --> 2154.079
out there

2150.0 --> 2156.24
because yeah see it like this i i think

2154.079 --> 2157.52
the sunlight and the sun and all the

2156.24 --> 2160.64
heavenly lights are

2157.52 --> 2163.119
basically fed into by the electric

2160.64 --> 2164.0
ether which is the energy field that

2163.119 --> 2168.96
feeds all

2164.0 --> 2172.48
things in this realm the stars and life

2168.96 --> 2173.04
right and probably also causes the tides

2172.48 --> 2175.76
and all

2173.04 --> 2178.48
and and the magnetic field of earth it

2175.76 --> 2181.0400000000004
is like the energy in the realm that

2178.48 --> 2182.64
that drives everything that feeds the

2181.04 --> 2184.48
life into everything

2182.64 --> 2187.04
and if there's something happening on a

2184.48 --> 2190.16
specific frequency in this field

2187.04 --> 2190.56
then the sun could be influenced and

2190.16 --> 2195.2
could

2190.56 --> 2197.119
give off signs elements

2195.2 --> 2199.2799999999997
that can even be perceived on earth but

2197.119 --> 2201.2000000000003
the thing is is that the heliocentrist

2199.28 --> 2202.0
and the astronomers what they do with

2201.2 --> 2206.96
all of this

2202.0 --> 2209.359
the meteorologists even they

2206.96 --> 2210.64
they take note of this and then they

2209.359 --> 2213.119
tell a story

2210.64 --> 2214.0
in line with the heliocentric conception

2213.119 --> 2216.1600000000003
so they give you

2214.0 --> 2217.359
another version of it that uses the

2216.16 --> 2220.3999999999996
vernacular

2217.359 --> 2222.56
and the conceptions of heliocentrism

2220.4 --> 2225.119
they suddenly imagine that it is

2222.56 --> 2227.119
the fiery ball and there's like

2225.119 --> 2228.32
something happening on the fiery ball

2227.119 --> 2232.32
and there's like a

2228.32 --> 2235.599
a hole and might be like it's launching

2232.32 --> 2237.599
super fire and that causes radiation and

2235.599 --> 2238.2400000000002
that influences the earth's magnetic

2237.599 --> 2240.079
field

2238.24 --> 2241.52
and then this happens and it could be an

2240.079 --> 2244.079
emp effect

2241.52 --> 2246.24
blah blah blah but that is all literally

2244.079 --> 2247.52
the storytelling tradition of the

2246.24 --> 2250.3199999999997
heliocentric

2247.52 --> 2252.96
translation of things that might

2250.32 --> 2255.76
actually be happening in the realm

2252.96 --> 2256.079
that are just completely different like

2255.76 --> 2258.88
more

2256.079 --> 2261.52
as i tried to describe it before i

2258.88 --> 2265.6800000000003
engaged in the heliocentric explanation

2261.52 --> 2267.52
see it's all back engineered entire

2265.68 --> 2270.64
heliocentrism is like back

2267.52 --> 2271.52
is a story cover back engineered based

2270.64 --> 2274.64
on

2271.52 --> 2274.64
real things that happen

2277.44 --> 2287.28
it's the fairy tale version of reality

2284.03 --> 2289.28
[Music]

2287.28 --> 2292.23
i like that i'm gonna title this show

2289.28 --> 2295.289
like that and then i'm gonna round it

2292.23 --> 2295.289
[Music]

2296.839 --> 2302.149
out

2299.09 --> 2302.1490000000003
[Music]

2304.86 --> 2310.219
[Music]

2318.8 --> 2330.5600000000004
yeah i like that

2326.64 --> 2332.4
right so anyway uh yeah i hope uh

2330.56 --> 2334.48
i helped answer some question it

2332.4 --> 2336.8
probably

2334.48 --> 2337.76
gave you a lot of new questions but yeah

2336.8 --> 2340.6400000000003
please uh

2337.76 --> 2341.92
i hope you enjoyed this show and we'll

2340.64 --> 2344.0789999999997
come back

2341.92 --> 2345.28
i'm always ready for more uh yeah i'll

2344.079 --> 2348.0
be back tomorrow

2345.28 --> 2349.44
so let me just run out the show thanks

2348.0 --> 2351.76
