clouded

188.58 --> 191.42000000000002
dreary

192.72 --> 198.06
there's no wind but there's like there's

195.239 --> 201.18
literally rain right now but it's like

198.06 --> 203.879
kind of dreary rain it's not a rainstorm

201.18 --> 207.62
or anything it's just kind of wet it's

203.879 --> 207.62
really warm alongside that

207.739 --> 213.62
so it's like this

210.319 --> 213.61999999999998
sticky day

214.98 --> 218.17999999999998

238.72 --> 244.519

so how are you all doing

274.38 --> 277.55
[Music]

277.56 --> 282.72
like I

279.3 --> 285.3
I feel like a little icky

282.72 --> 287.46000000000004
like mostly like the moist was pretty

285.3 --> 291.78000000000003
much all night too and just

287.46 --> 293.75899999999996
didn't sleep like the best of ways

291.78 --> 295.79999999999995
uh

293.759 --> 298.82
also there was like noise in the night

295.8 --> 298.82
which is annoying

303.08 --> 307.75899999999996
yeah

304.68 --> 307.759
but I'll be all right

310.259 --> 315.08000000000004
uh

311.759 --> 315.08000000000004
uh see yeah yesterday

325.44 --> 330.18
wasn't

326.759 --> 332.82
a whole lot of stuff going on but there

330.18 --> 335.52
was ball busters live but

332.82 --> 338.82
I was just like

335.52 --> 342.419
not in the mood to get on there

338.82 --> 345.29
so I kind of stuck to chat

342.419 --> 348.399
I was late to the party anyway

345.29 --> 348.399
[Music]

348.6 --> 354.12
I guess I just yesterday I kind of feel

351.479 --> 358.15999999999997
tired and slow bit and then in the night

354.12 --> 358.16
I did go kind of watch Netflix

358.979 --> 364.74
some crazy ass action movie full of

362.88 --> 367.919
propaganda

364.74 --> 370.02
like really full of propaganda almost

367.919 --> 371.28
gave me a headache just sitting through

370.02 --> 373.79999999999995
it

371.28 --> 375.419
even though as an action movie it was

373.8 --> 379.8
interesting

375.419 --> 384.96
it was all just kind of dark and harsh

379.8 --> 389.58
military but like not in the best ways

384.96 --> 392.4
uh also watched like

389.58 --> 396.59999999999997
that was like this weird little He-Man

392.4 --> 399.35999999999996
mini series things

396.6 --> 401.66
and like I was curious about what that

399.36 --> 401.66
was

405.3 --> 408.979
oh we got a derp alert

409.68 --> 414.56
right but I watched that and it was like

414.9 --> 419.12
very different from what I expected

421.5 --> 427.199
it was like pretty modern

423.78 --> 428.52
and it was like made in a way that kind

427.199 --> 432.90000000000003
of

428.52 --> 436.19899999999996
reminds me of like like the better

432.9 --> 439.08
more serious type of

436.199 --> 441.62
cartoons from the 90s

439.08 --> 446.039
that what is it again the the Batman

441.62 --> 448.979
cartoon just very like very revered it's

446.039 --> 451.74
very well made stylish and everything's

448.979 --> 454.08
so serious right well it had a bit of

451.74 --> 457.139
that too and that was weird because it's

454.08 --> 459.539
freaking He Man and it's like uh

457.139 --> 461.819
it is kind of weird hey man you know the

459.539 --> 464.46
lore and all that but they like built it

461.819 --> 466.86
like super serious

464.46 --> 471.06
and

466.86 --> 474.3
like with drama and everything and like

471.06 --> 477.78000000000003
a whole magical lore that was being

474.3 --> 480.44
addressed felt very D and D to me like

477.78 --> 483.539
so it was completely not what I expected

480.44 --> 485.699
and actually kept watching it

483.539 --> 488.46
uh

485.699 --> 490.259
I'll get back to you about it when I get

488.46 --> 492.78
through it but it was more interesting

490.259 --> 497.039
than I had expected and like

492.78 --> 500.58
it didn't seem like gay like it the old

497.039 --> 504.3
He-Man had like these really weird

500.58 --> 506.099
gay undertones right everybody knows

504.3 --> 508.639
about that it's been memed about to no

506.099 --> 513.12
end well it seems like this new series

508.639 --> 518.279
like really made effort to prevent that

513.12 --> 521.24
effect it was all very serious and

518.279 --> 521.24
and yeah

523.44 --> 528.2600000000001
right so I got caught up watching that

529.14 --> 533.42
very weird

531.779 --> 535.74
but yeah

533.42 --> 538.38
unexpectedly interesting

535.74 --> 541.2
uh this sometimes happens you know I

538.38 --> 544.08
click on something like with oh God like

541.2 --> 546.12
how weird or bad is this gonna be and

544.08 --> 549.1800000000001
then it kind of is like wait this is

546.12 --> 552.44
actually unexpectedly good

549.18 --> 552.4399999999999
I gotta watch this

553.019 --> 558.68
anyway

555.12 --> 558.68
the new Top Gun

568.2 --> 573.0
they're using the Top Gun movie for me

571.14 --> 575.399
duh

573.0 --> 578.339
that's what

575.399 --> 581.399
that's part of the business

578.339 --> 585.839
like every military

581.399 --> 589.62
movie is partially advertisement when I

585.839 --> 591.6600000000001
watch that movie I'll just name it I I

589.62 --> 595.14
don't think it's like a good movie

591.66 --> 596.9399999999999
although the action was it was all very

595.14 --> 599.519
serious

596.94 --> 601.5
so it's like the choreography and all

599.519 --> 604.86
that

601.5 --> 607.8
were pretty high grade

604.86 --> 610.5
and like militarily researched about

607.8 --> 613.62
hand-to-hand combat and like very

610.5 --> 615.48
serious but like the overall story was

613.62 --> 617.579
just crazy

615.48 --> 620.519
it was almost like

617.579 --> 624.959
a fake drill

620.519 --> 627.68
that goes real except it's a movie and

624.959 --> 627.68
they don't

628.74 --> 635.04
it was blatantly as some kind of a

631.92 --> 637.74
programming movie blatantly and like the

635.04 --> 641.399
whole seriously like the opponent were

637.74 --> 642.54
white supremacist I could can't not

641.399 --> 648.0
kidding

642.54 --> 650.04
like American bad supremacist Traders

648.0 --> 652.579
this is

650.04 --> 652.579
right

652.98 --> 655.7
uh

664.32 --> 667.399
what's it called again

678.18 --> 685.1999999999999
oh yeah interceptor

681.48 --> 687.839
about like Nuke Interceptor yeah

685.2 --> 690.779
surface-to-air missile platform and like

687.839 --> 693.6
everything was just about that it was so

690.779 --> 696.18
incredibly military and it's like

693.6 --> 698.5790000000001
military advertisement on all fronts the

696.18 --> 702.4799999999999
entire thing

698.579 --> 704.0999999999999
and the main character is a woman

702.48 --> 706.5600000000001
but

704.1 --> 708.779
I don't know she kind of pulls it off

706.56 --> 711.3599999999999
and like there's some like very

708.779 --> 713.76
interesting stunt work

711.36 --> 715.6800000000001
so

713.76 --> 718.86
it's one of those movies where you're

715.68 --> 722.16
like it's in your face it's like super

718.86 --> 725.7
propaganda the bad way but at the same

722.16 --> 728.639
time they kind of do pull off a pretty

725.7 --> 732.48
good and interesting action movie

728.639 --> 734.839
but it's like in your face staring to

732.48 --> 738.6800000000001
you like yeah

734.839 --> 743.0400000000001
you know what we are

738.68 --> 744.7199999999999
and you know some people will just bite

743.04 --> 749.06
straight into it

744.72 --> 749.0600000000001
still after everything that's happened

756.3 --> 759.899
right I haven't actually seen the Top

758.339 --> 761.519
Gun movie

759.899 --> 764.1
but

761.519 --> 766.32
I have no doubt that it's like like the

764.1 --> 769.139
old Top Gun movie

766.32 --> 772.74
dude the old Top Gun movie was just

769.139 --> 775.2
straight out Military advertisement

772.74 --> 777.6
and it it made a lot of youngsters

775.2 --> 779.399
interested in actually doing something

777.6 --> 781.6800000000001
like that

779.399 --> 784.38
so yeah

781.68 --> 786.92
of course the new Top Gun movie is gonna

784.38 --> 786.92
do that too

792.06 --> 794.7199999999999
right

803.94 --> 806.6

foreign

1032.059 --> 1035.059
Dutch

1036.74 --> 1043.28
and Cosmos that sounds like a Dutch

1039.38 --> 1046.1000000000001
University or school thing that I

1043.28 --> 1047.839
recognize they're apparently all doing

1046.1 --> 1050.799
that

1047.839 --> 1050.799
goody

1051.44 --> 1059.059
thanks Netherlands you're so Progressive

1056.299 --> 1063.32
Sodom and Gomorrah Style

1059.059 --> 1065.4189999999999
and progress towards fire bombing

1063.32 --> 1068.539
Annihilation is

1065.419 --> 1071.26
yeah you're certainly getting there as

1068.539 --> 1071.26
quick as you can

1082.46 --> 1085.6000000000001
uh not really okay

1085.94 --> 1088.94
virus

1094.52 --> 1099.76
Clover shows me a diagram that has a

1096.86 --> 1099.76
sphere in it

1100.039 --> 1104.299
is that begging the question it depends

1103.039 --> 1107.539
on

1104.299 --> 1109.8799999999999
just a picture is not necessarily

1107.539 --> 1111.26
begging the question right begging the

1109.88 --> 1113.2990000000002
question

1111.26 --> 1116.36
is

1113.299 --> 1120.02
a piece of reasoning it is a description

1116.36 --> 1121.2199999999998
it is a train of thinking it is a claim

1120.02 --> 1125.36
yeah

1121.22 --> 1127.58
a picture is just a picture

1125.36 --> 1130.8799999999999
it depends on what somebody's saying

1127.58 --> 1133.96
about it yeah come back with a

1130.88 --> 1133.96
a better name

1161.059 --> 1165.62
so I hope that answers your question

1163.34 --> 1169.039
seed planting

1165.62 --> 1170.539
just a picture isn't necessarily begging

1169.039 --> 1173.08
the question it's what they're gonna say

1170.539 --> 1173.08
about it

1175.76 --> 1181.52
also in what context are they showing

1179.059 --> 1184.7
you this fear are they showing you like

1181.52 --> 1187.58
for example oh this is how Celestial

1184.7 --> 1190.76
navigation would work on a sphere in

1187.58 --> 1192.559
autographic view right now then it

1190.76 --> 1195.26
becomes begging the question because of

1192.559 --> 1199.34
the context because it is used as part

1195.26 --> 1202.64
of the inquiry and the claim

1199.34 --> 1205.1789999999999
does that answer your question

1202.64 --> 1205.179
good

1215.539 --> 1222.559
it's Jubilee no I didn't max the niche

1219.86 --> 1224.9599999999998
ah you you actually saw that movie

1222.559 --> 1227.36
that I watched

1224.96 --> 1232.3400000000001
it was kind of good

1227.36 --> 1236.26
but it's also super propaganda like

1232.34 --> 1236.26
like so media

1237.5 --> 1241.82
it's like somebody that doesn't have a

1240.08 --> 1244.039
real oversight can't distinguish

1241.82 --> 1245.6589999999999
properly between movies and like the

1244.039 --> 1250.64
reality

1245.659 --> 1254.679
this movie's really basically meant

1250.64 --> 1254.679
to cement their train of thinking

1257.48 --> 1260.78
like if you don't have all your

1259.039 --> 1263.179
faculties and you're gonna watch that

1260.78 --> 1266.559
movie then it's going to program you I

1263.179 --> 1266.5590000000002
absolutely it is

1267.62 --> 1270.9399999999998
uh Hey Cleary

1331.1 --> 1336.2199999999998
uh also watch the bit of old Benjamin

1339.32 --> 1342.1
thought that

1343.34 --> 1349.72
wait what let's uploaded

1347.059 --> 1349.72
today

1349.76 --> 1356.419
but yeah it's probably yesterday's show

1352.46 --> 1359.6000000000001
Saturday it was really interesting

1356.419 --> 1362.96
I like that when Owen Benjamin basically

1359.6 --> 1365.24
shares his women lore with me is like

1362.96 --> 1367.22
very useful and I have a lot to

1365.24 --> 1368.36
basically reflect upon when he talks

1367.22 --> 1370.88
about that

1368.36 --> 1376.4799999999998
so I really appreciate that much more

1370.88 --> 1376.48
than just his oh sex shaming in general

1378.94 --> 1385.52
which can't like it it yeah can get a

1383.179 --> 1388.22
bit tedious didn't really care too much

1385.52 --> 1390.8799999999999
for the previous few shows

1388.22 --> 1390.88
uh

1398.659 --> 1403.8200000000002
although of course he does have a point

1401.24 --> 1406.78
it's just that

1403.82 --> 1406.78
I have

1406.88 --> 1412.24
I want to have just

1409.46 --> 1412.24
something

1412.36 --> 1418.28
left in my mind that I don't have to

1415.82 --> 1422.059
just like

1418.28 --> 1423.3799999999999
cut out of my imagination entirely if

1422.059 --> 1425.8999999999999
you don't mind

1423.38 --> 1427.5800000000002
uh

1425.9 --> 1429.26
but

1427.58 --> 1431.74
I have learned

1429.26 --> 1431.74
anyway

1432.71 --> 1435.839
[Music]

1446.059 --> 1452.12
okay Matthew Hall

1449.26 --> 1455.44
yeah I don't know what the hell Cleary

1452.12 --> 1455.4399999999998
is doing it's annoying

1481.4 --> 1485.3200000000002
hello David r Rice

1499.52 --> 1501.7
foreign

1512.08 --> 1518.1399999999999
it's just this continual slow rain out

1515.96 --> 1518.14
there

1518.539 --> 1520.72
foreign

1523.88 --> 1528.88
but it is enough to like keep everything

1526.279 --> 1528.88
wet

1531.799 --> 1535.72
but you can barely even see it

1540.2 --> 1545.32
vacuous statement yeah no [ __ ]

1561.26 --> 1566.919
[Music]

1563.24 --> 1566.919
right so guys come on

1571.82 --> 1575.2
what are we going to talk about

1578.36 --> 1582.58
Faith letter Sage good to see you

1585.74 --> 1591.559
okay well thanks Clary thanks for your

1589.1 --> 1593.86
random blabbering

1591.559 --> 1593.86
okay

1594.559 --> 1600.52
yeah that was sarcasm that's it's kind

1597.559 --> 1600.52
of annoying

1602.6 --> 1604.8999999999999
foreign

1656.72 --> 1662.08
I hope I'm well yeah I'm doing well

1659.899 --> 1662.08
enough

1672.32 --> 1677.72
hey Crockett

1674.6 --> 1680.98
right but look guys I I want to talk

1677.72 --> 1680.98
about something but

1681.02 --> 1688.7
it's not gonna work if everybody's just

1683.36 --> 1688.6999999999998
kind of muttering about nothing so

1688.94 --> 1691.1200000000001
foreign

1713.44 --> 1719.179
after watching the transit of Venus

1716.48 --> 1722.72
across the Sun

1719.179 --> 1725.0590000000002
was told by spirits that Venus was

1722.72 --> 1727.299
almost the same size as Earth really is

1725.059 --> 1727.299
that

1727.58 --> 1732.6999999999998
is that like officially noted

1734.0 --> 1738.26
wow

1736.58 --> 1741.34
that's special

1738.26 --> 1741.34
if that's true

1747.799 --> 1755.1399999999999
big day climbing tomorrow okay

1751.539 --> 1755.14
sounds interesting

1764.48 --> 1771.679
on a 24 7 Discord a year ago

1768.14 --> 1776.24
oh somebody's oh so you heard it like

1771.679 --> 1779.419
third person that you actually trace it

1776.24 --> 1782.6
was there a citation

1779.419 --> 1784.94
because it could have been somebody just

1782.6 --> 1788.539
making it up

1784.94 --> 1792.22
you know if you don't get a source could

1788.539 --> 1792.22
somebody be just making that up

1808.039 --> 1811.419
got it from a book

1812.0 --> 1814.539
okay

1816.62 --> 1819.279
right

1820.82 --> 1825.74
who wrote the book was that a person

1823.52 --> 1829.279
that actually lived in the same time

1825.74 --> 1832.279
period as Ptolemy

1829.279 --> 1836.12
it could literally be so just

1832.279 --> 1839.02
a baseless assertion of a guy that just

1836.12 --> 1839.02
wrote about him

1839.36 --> 1841.84
right

1849.08 --> 1853.84
but those Spirits could be no [ __ ]

1851.36 --> 1853.84
Sherlock

1853.88 --> 1857.6200000000001
but look

1860.12 --> 1866.4189999999999
it doesn't have God why are you making

1863.0 --> 1867.62
me actually go with like it could be

1866.419 --> 1871.1000000000001
real

1867.62 --> 1873.6789999999999
I mean usually when people in history

1871.1 --> 1876.1399999999999
that are like really prominent in

1873.679 --> 1880.519
changing the system say things like oh

1876.14 --> 1884.0
Spirit sold this just made up it's just

1880.519 --> 1886.519
an excuse come on

1884.0 --> 1888.98
like you're seriously not gonna believe

1886.519 --> 1891.08
that they actually thought

1888.98 --> 1893.059
that they were getting that message and

1891.08 --> 1895.24
that that's how it was meant there's no

1893.059 --> 1895.24
way

1895.7 --> 1901.8990000000001
just looking over those people are what

1898.039 --> 1901.899
they do there is no way

1930.62 --> 1933.6799999999998
[Music]

1933.799 --> 1935.98
foreign

1941.62 --> 1944.79
[Music]

1961.6 --> 1966.6789999999999
that's an interesting job

1964.77 --> 1969.94
[Music]

1966.679 --> 1969.94
because I'm not man

1973.64 --> 1976.96
hey Adam eiken

1981.5 --> 1986.0
he stated the Earth was thank you

1984.08 --> 1988.039
clearly

1986.0 --> 1990.32
thank you

1988.039 --> 1993.279
see

1990.32 --> 1993.279
I thought so

2000.399 --> 2004.36
it sounds like somebody just made it up

2002.5 --> 2005.81
about him

2004.36 --> 2008.9199999999998
right

2005.81 --> 2008.9199999999998
[Music]

2025.779 --> 2031.059
but tell me postulated it after he

2028.6 --> 2034.539
watched the transit

2031.059 --> 2037.48
yeah okay but see yeah okay secret star

2034.539 --> 2040.0
what about just making a suggestion like

2037.48 --> 2042.22
hey maybe Venus is the same size as the

2040.0 --> 2045.46
Earth right

2042.22 --> 2049.359
that seems much more likely

2045.46 --> 2050.8
than like oh Spirits told me like

2049.359 --> 2053.379
really

2050.8 --> 2056.3390000000004
that just seems completely nonsensical

2053.379 --> 2056.339
and superfluous

2072.76 --> 2075.76
right

2079.24 --> 2081.9599999999996
huh

2106.119 --> 2113.82
where's that knees do I just tell them

2109.18 --> 2113.8199999999997
he measured a flat Earth with his angles

2116.16 --> 2121.839
well

2117.76 --> 2125.4
look the whole thing about Aristotle's

2121.839 --> 2130.119
is that what he basically did

2125.4 --> 2133.1800000000003
what his entire Legacy

2130.119 --> 2135.6400000000003
within heliocentrism is is that he's

2133.18 --> 2137.5
like suggested to be the first to

2135.64 --> 2141.16
presuppose

2137.5 --> 2145.599
that the Earth is a ball underneath

2141.16 --> 2147.94
the celestials that are a ball around it

2145.599 --> 2150.2200000000003
that's what he suggested

2147.94 --> 2154.359
like with the sun angles

2150.22 --> 2157.54
so he is like the like the example of

2154.359 --> 2159.7599999999998
the one to First presuppose the Earth is

2157.54 --> 2162.24
a ball based on Shadows

2159.76 --> 2162.2400000000002
right

2162.4 --> 2166.42
when people say oh he's he proved the

2164.619 --> 2168.94
Earth was a ball by the shadow working

2166.42 --> 2171.46
in different places at the same time how

2168.94 --> 2174.54
can the shadow be from a different angle

2171.46 --> 2178.0
on the same on different places on Earth

2174.54 --> 2180.4
if it's supposedly flat that can't

2178.0 --> 2182.619
happen it has to be a ball because then

2180.4 --> 2185.56
it it matches

2182.619 --> 2187.8
yeah if you presuppose the Earth is a

2185.56 --> 2193.72
ball underneath

2187.8 --> 2196.54
that Celestial ball of lights that

2193.72 --> 2200.2
surrounds us including the sun yeah

2196.54 --> 2203.2
but it is fundamentally presuppose

2200.2 --> 2203.2
presuppositional

2220.0 --> 2226.42
right because he didn't actually measure

2223.18 --> 2227.74
the Earth with his angles you see he

2226.42 --> 2232.54
never even

2227.74 --> 2235.1189999999997
within his tests there The Horizon was

2232.54 --> 2237.099
never involved he just look at the

2235.119 --> 2238.0
lights at the sky and the shadow they

2237.099 --> 2241.079
cast

2238.0 --> 2241.079
that's what he did

2242.02 --> 2247.9
he never even took into account like the

2245.26 --> 2249.5200000000004
Horizon and the angles of the Horizon

2247.9 --> 2252.579
and

2249.52 --> 2256.18
to prove it's a ball right that's where

2252.579 --> 2258.88
the other story of Alba Rooney comes in

2256.18 --> 2260.0789999999997
who actually measured the Earth to be

2258.88 --> 2262.48
flat

2260.079 --> 2265.1800000000003
to establish the height of the mountain

2262.48 --> 2267.04
that he then climbed in order to

2265.18 --> 2271.06
presuppose that the Horizon was

2267.04 --> 2274.119
geometric to supposedly prove

2271.06 --> 2276.04
the Earth is a ball

2274.119 --> 2278.5
but Aristotle and he's never did any of

2276.04 --> 2282.04
that he just took the angles of the

2278.5 --> 2284.98
light he never even argued or involved

2282.04 --> 2287.7
the horizon

2284.98 --> 2289.96
so it was a pure

2287.7 --> 2293.46
unadulterated presupposition of the

2289.96 --> 2293.46
Earth being a ball underneath it

2297.16 --> 2302.339
the erostok needs back the question yes

2299.38 --> 2305.98
he is like the primary

2302.339 --> 2308.4
example of presupposition of Earth

2305.98 --> 2308.4
ball

2315.339 --> 2320.02
I can't see how those days I could have

2317.92 --> 2322.66
synced experiments if they wouldn't have

2320.02 --> 2324.94
need to be synced BJC net

2322.66 --> 2328.1189999999997
they wouldn't have needed to

2324.94 --> 2331.599
right Aristotle supposedly all he'd

2328.119 --> 2334.06
needed to do is have colleagues they

2331.599 --> 2336.1600000000003
spread out and they plan

2334.06 --> 2339.4
like yeah

2336.16 --> 2342.2799999999997
this day this hour

2339.4 --> 2344.64
you check that light and you make a note

2342.28 --> 2344.6400000000003
of it

2344.8 --> 2349.7200000000003
and then afterward they come back and

2347.5 --> 2352.359
it's like okay what were your angle

2349.72 --> 2356.0789999999997
right it

2352.359 --> 2358.2999999999997
I mean come on that that part is that is

2356.079 --> 2361.0
no challenge

2358.3 --> 2365.5600000000004
you just have a bunch of colleagues

2361.0 --> 2366.7
and you pre-arrange a time when to do

2365.56 --> 2368.98
that

2366.7 --> 2370.8999999999996
and then you make the the angle

2368.98 --> 2373.66
measurement with the shadow you make a

2370.9 --> 2376.3
little note done you come back together

2373.66 --> 2379.68
you got it you got the data I don't see

2376.3 --> 2379.6800000000003
any kind of dilemma there

2382.58 --> 2385.739
[Music]

2392.38 --> 2397.38
if you had a mobile phone no you

2394.42 --> 2397.38
wouldn't have needed to

2399.88 --> 2405.88
the locations would have been pre-chosen

2403.0 --> 2408.88
even like coordinated on a map

2405.88 --> 2410.5
then it's like okay you take your note

2408.88 --> 2413.6800000000003
block

2410.5 --> 2416.079
and your goose feather and ink and you

2413.68 --> 2417.7
go to that location on that date and

2416.079 --> 2420.1600000000003
that time of the day you make that

2417.7 --> 2423.7799999999997
measurement and you make a note of it

2420.16 --> 2423.7799999999997
that's how they would have done it

2423.88 --> 2428.6800000000003
you don't need a mobile phone to do that

2426.04 --> 2431.46
you just need careful planning and

2428.68 --> 2431.46
plenty of time

2433.96 --> 2439.209
foreign

2435.3 --> 2439.2090000000003
[Music]

2442.88 --> 2446.449
[Music]

2461.92 --> 2466.839
I I don't understand Adam

2511.72 --> 2517.56
how do I measure when you know how much

2513.94 --> 2517.56
well you would need

2518.46 --> 2524.2
basically watches and in that time yeah

2521.56 --> 2527.56
there probably were no watches so you'd

2524.2 --> 2530.56
need very very carefully calibrated

2527.56 --> 2530.56
hourglasses

2531.46 --> 2537.119
right you have like

2533.92 --> 2540.64
several huge hourglasses that would like

2537.119 --> 2542.92
last for a week say

2540.64 --> 2545.98
they'd be carefully tested to like run

2542.92 --> 2548.44
out at exactly the same time

2545.98 --> 2550.66
you start out

2548.44 --> 2551.56
activating them all and then it's like

2550.66 --> 2556.24
okay

2551.56 --> 2558.46
when the last little piece of sand falls

2556.24 --> 2560.859
through The Hourglass

2558.46 --> 2563.14
is when you have to take the measurement

2560.859 --> 2564.64
and you have to be there so make sure

2563.14 --> 2566.2599999999998
you're going to be in the right spot in

2564.64 --> 2568.2999999999997
a week time

2566.26 --> 2570.579
and you can and then they take the

2568.3 --> 2572.92
measurement right so you know it is

2570.579 --> 2574.6600000000003
absolutely the exact same time when

2572.92 --> 2576.76
you're going to take the measurement

2574.66 --> 2580.2999999999997
you don't need mobile phones you now

2576.76 --> 2582.28
need watches standardized time you just

2580.3 --> 2585.88
need very carefully calibrated

2582.28 --> 2588.1600000000003
hourglasses that last very long

2585.88 --> 2590.6800000000003
and not freaking break them in your

2588.16 --> 2593.7599999999998
journey because then you're screwed you

2590.68 --> 2593.7599999999998
can start all over again

2598.18 --> 2602.5789999999997
dude I don't even know what you're

2599.859 --> 2602.5789999999997
talking about Adam

2602.98 --> 2607.96
what do you mean hourglass does not work

2605.8 --> 2610.42
do you have to have an exact time

2607.96 --> 2614.619
coordination or not

2610.42 --> 2617.2200000000003
why wouldn't our glass not work

2614.619 --> 2620.1400000000003
isn't that what that was for

2617.22 --> 2623.04
exact time

2620.14 --> 2623.04
coordination

2629.02 --> 2635.38
it's about the actual time have to be

2633.16 --> 2637.24
perfectly synchronized in very different

2635.38 --> 2639.1600000000003
locations even when you don't

2637.24 --> 2642.2799999999997
necessarily even know

2639.16 --> 2644.92
what how it even works there you just

2642.28 --> 2647.1400000000003
have to have the exact same time and the

2644.92 --> 2649.9
proper coordinates

2647.14 --> 2652.56
that's all hourglasses

2649.9 --> 2655.839
very careful not to break them start out

2652.56 --> 2657.7599999999998
activating them go to the location and

2655.839 --> 2659.44
then exactly when it runs out is when

2657.76 --> 2660.8190000000004
you do the angle measurement and you

2659.44 --> 2661.96
have to be there you have to make sure

2660.819 --> 2665.02
it doesn't break

2661.96 --> 2669.66
that's it yeah complicated enough as it

2665.02 --> 2669.66
is I don't see any kind of issue here

2669.88 --> 2676.859
you have to know the exact time variance

2674.079 --> 2676.8590000000004
what

2680.319 --> 2687.2799999999997
but if you have perfectly coordinated

2683.52 --> 2688.66
hourglasses that run out at exactly the

2687.28 --> 2691.6600000000003
same moment

2688.66 --> 2694.54
if you activate them all together

2691.66 --> 2697.839
then that should not be an issue because

2694.54 --> 2699.96
you have the exact same moment even at a

2697.839 --> 2699.96
distance

2700.24 --> 2705.22
it's not what is claimed it's imagining

2702.76 --> 2707.7000000000003
yes I am just imagining a solution it's

2705.22 --> 2707.7
what I do

2707.8 --> 2713.6800000000003
I have no idea what the [ __ ] supposedly

2710.8 --> 2716.46
said about Aristotle's I'm literally

2713.68 --> 2719.2
just like okay

2716.46 --> 2721.78
aristotonies this is the age this is the

2719.2 --> 2723.9399999999996
technology available you're tasked to do

2721.78 --> 2726.6400000000003
this how were you gonna do this well I

2723.94 --> 2728.079
just literally gave you my plan on how

2726.64 --> 2731.16
to do that

2728.079 --> 2734.079
is not saying they actually did anything

2731.16 --> 2737.8799999999997
or that it they would have done it like

2734.079 --> 2737.88
that but that's how I would have done it

2739.66 --> 2743.859
our glass was invented in the 8th

2742.0 --> 2746.46
Century A.D

2743.859 --> 2746.46
well

2748.06 --> 2753.7599999999998
in a market

2750.52 --> 2757.9
fair enough right

2753.76 --> 2759.46
but that's like an official yeah

2757.9 --> 2760.839
officially

2759.46 --> 2763.42
I mean

2760.839 --> 2767.5
dude there's been like

2763.42 --> 2771.64
what is it again electric batteries

2767.5 --> 2772.839
found in Egyptian temples and [ __ ] that

2771.64 --> 2775.2999999999997
are like

2772.839 --> 2776.619
thousands of BC

2775.3 --> 2779.1400000000003
so

2776.619 --> 2782.079
you know oh hourglass was officially

2779.14 --> 2784.92
invented in the 18th century yeah sure

2782.079 --> 2784.92
sure it was

2786.819 --> 2792.579
I mean of course that's the first time

2789.9 --> 2796.0
anybody's ever thought of that it's not

2792.579 --> 2799.54
like oh glass

2796.0 --> 2802.119
you melt sand oh sand that's all right

2799.54 --> 2805.7799999999997
yeah no definitely somebody could have

2802.119 --> 2810.28
figured that out like a long ago

2805.78 --> 2810.28
because it's not like impossible

2810.76 --> 2816.2200000000003
to make such a thing with very low Tech

2813.339 --> 2818.92
even I mean it's going to be difficult

2816.22 --> 2821.5
if you're very creative then with very

2818.92 --> 2822.88
little tools you could make one very

2821.5 --> 2825.339
early

2822.88 --> 2828.599
right and then proceed to keep

2825.339 --> 2828.599
perfecting it right

2833.079 --> 2837.2200000000003
I mean

2834.819 --> 2839.7
yeah necessity is the mother of

2837.22 --> 2839.7
invention

2848.14 --> 2854.5
so that's my response

2851.5 --> 2856.839
it's I don't this is probably not really

2854.5 --> 2859.38
helping in any Flat Earth versus Globe

2856.839 --> 2859.38
debates

2860.44 --> 2863.339
hmm

2866.76 --> 2872.559
well keeping an hourglass balance is not

2870.099 --> 2875.44
as difficult as you can imagine if you

2872.559 --> 2877.78
just have it in a weight

2875.44 --> 2879.579
right you can literally have it almost

2877.78 --> 2881.7400000000002
like

2879.579 --> 2883.96
like hanging free

2881.74 --> 2885.52
and so it's oh no matter even if you're

2883.96 --> 2888.579
shaking it's always going to be like

2885.52 --> 2891.24
perfectly but you could to theoretically

2888.579 --> 2891.2400000000002
do that

2891.76 --> 2896.44
I mean they probably wouldn't have done

2894.16 --> 2901.7999999999997
that because it's just like so much

2896.44 --> 2901.8
effort for something so ethereal but

2905.26 --> 2908.28
hey Alicia

2909.04 --> 2914.38
it wasn't an hour class more like a

2911.5 --> 2917.8
stopwatch than a clock yes a Como virus

2914.38 --> 2920.8
and if you have a very big hourglass

2917.8 --> 2925.0
then potentially you could make it last

2920.8 --> 2930.3590000000004
a week with one single go

2925.0 --> 2930.359
or more who knows dude I don't know man

2937.0 --> 2942.16
like how big an hourglass could you

2939.76 --> 2945.599
theoretically make and still be able to

2942.16 --> 2948.16
transport it like using

2945.599 --> 2952.54
basic Wheels

2948.16 --> 2955.2
and horses and donkeys like

2952.54 --> 2955.2
I didn't

2955.24 --> 2957.9599999999996
uh

2971.14 --> 2977.92
but yeah carrying a giant hourglass 500

2975.16 --> 2980.7599999999998
miles across the desert does seem like a

2977.92 --> 2980.76
bit of a chore

2983.02 --> 2987.339
the yeah that that seems like a crazy

2985.54 --> 2990.24
risk to do that

2987.339 --> 2990.24
I get it

3007.14 --> 3011.4
subject of the section seems to be over

3009.359 --> 3014.7
it was getting old

3011.4 --> 3016.079
no I mean that's never gonna be actually

3014.7 --> 3019.5589999999997
over

3016.079 --> 3021.48
I mean Sexton proves that

3019.559 --> 3025.2000000000003
the Earth is flat

3021.48 --> 3027.72
like mechanically geometrically

3025.2 --> 3031.4399999999996
is like one of the most dead-on proofs

3027.72 --> 3034.14
of just how it has revealed

3031.44 --> 3038.04
how the globe model was fundamentally

3034.14 --> 3041.359
constructed on data

3038.04 --> 3041.359
of a flat plane

3042.059 --> 3046.6800000000003
Dr utker

3043.8 --> 3048.3
yeah so yeah it might be getting old to

3046.68 --> 3049.859
you

3048.3 --> 3052.079
Globe believer

3049.859 --> 3055.2599999999998
but it's not going to get old anytime

3052.079 --> 3057.059
soon I mean as Sexton is a pretty

3055.26 --> 3060.0
ancient instrument

3057.059 --> 3061.1400000000003
it's old very old

3060.0 --> 3064.26
right

3061.14 --> 3067.6189999999997
still works and it reveals so much

3064.26 --> 3073.099
so yeah it's old but it's not getting

3067.619 --> 3073.099
old it's not aging it's pretty timeless

3081.3 --> 3086.94
six that's made for a globe oh really

3084.3 --> 3089.8390000000004
then how do you use a Sextant on a globe

3086.94 --> 3089.839
rural smoke

3090.72 --> 3095.0989999999997
explain it to us

3092.64 --> 3097.98
how are you going to take a

3095.099 --> 3099.3590000000004
an elevation angle from a curved

3097.98 --> 3101.46
adjacent how are you going to do that

3099.359 --> 3103.14
real smoke

3101.46 --> 3105.119
huh

3103.14 --> 3109.4
made for a globe

3105.119 --> 3109.4
yeah Deluge of derps it seems so

3109.619 --> 3115.5
yeah yeah kumu virus sex and argument is

3112.619 --> 3119.6400000000003
still funny it is very funny

3115.5 --> 3123.42
because it's such a lethal smack to the

3119.64 --> 3126.48
face for globe Believers that what else

3123.42 --> 3129.2000000000003
can you do but just laugh in humiliation

3126.48 --> 3129.2
I get it

3130.74 --> 3135.859
and you've done it quite a few times by

3133.079 --> 3135.8590000000004
now even

3136.38 --> 3141.98
with mic wide open

3138.3 --> 3141.98
we know Akuma virus

3145.68 --> 3151.9199999999996
oh my God on the globe it works yeah now

3149.579 --> 3153.8390000000004
what actor

3151.92 --> 3155.94
how

3153.839 --> 3158.88
does it work

3155.94 --> 3161.2200000000003
How do you take

3158.88 --> 3165.059
an elevation angle from a curved

3161.22 --> 3167.64
adjacent Dr utker tell me how does it

3165.059 --> 3171.48
work on the globe demonstrated huh

3167.64 --> 3178.2
numpty numpty [ __ ]

3171.48 --> 3178.2
yeah ignorant Fundy [ __ ] doctor huh

3179.16 --> 3185.22
maybe you should like stick to organic

3182.22 --> 3188.7799999999997
and not mainstream brand food

3185.22 --> 3188.7799999999997
for your name huh

3191.04 --> 3195.9
can be measured without seeing the rice

3193.079 --> 3198.42
yeah but that's not the question though

3195.9 --> 3202.5
it's not like oh you don't need to

3198.42 --> 3205.44
imagine no no but how do you do it

3202.5 --> 3209.22
yeah how do you do oh you demonstrated

3205.44 --> 3212.52
then oh really how how do you do it

3209.22 --> 3215.339
I don't have never seen a demonstration

3212.52 --> 3218.339
of measuring an elevation angle

3215.339 --> 3220.38
next to a curvature adjacent yeah I've

3218.339 --> 3222.24
never seen that actually done that's

3220.38 --> 3225.839
just you saying oh we've done it oh

3222.24 --> 3227.66
really how how do you do that then

3225.839 --> 3230.64
because the price kind of certain

3227.66 --> 3233.3999999999996
through well people actually testing it

3230.64 --> 3236.2799999999997
out on computers that if you do that

3233.4 --> 3240.1800000000003
with AutoCAD and all that you get a

3236.28 --> 3244.079
syntax error because it makes no sense

3240.18 --> 3247.5589999999997
yeah you can't actually do it that's the

3244.079 --> 3249.9
point it is geometrically impossible to

3247.559 --> 3253.3190000000004
get an elevation angle from a curved

3249.9 --> 3255.54
adjacent that's why it's the now number

3253.319 --> 3258.9
one housekeeping question

3255.54 --> 3260.46
so yeah everybody's done it of so easy

3258.9 --> 3263.04
you're gonna do it on the flutter oh

3260.46 --> 3265.02
really so how do you do it then on the

3263.04 --> 3268.079
globe how do you take that elevation

3265.02 --> 3270.3
angle on a curve of the Json then

3268.079 --> 3274.2000000000003
if everybody can do it can you

3270.3 --> 3277.2000000000003
demonstrate that can you explain in one

3274.2 --> 3279.96
or two sentences exactly step by step

3277.2 --> 3283.799
how you do

3279.96 --> 3285.839
get the elevation angle from that curve

3283.799 --> 3289.079
the Json on that ball you think you're

3285.839 --> 3292.64
standing on yeah do it then say it then

3289.079 --> 3292.6400000000003
numpty [ __ ] do it

3293.64 --> 3299.46
yeah

3294.9 --> 3302.04
you you can solve that syntax error

3299.46 --> 3303.78
when a computer program specifically

3302.04 --> 3307.44
designated to make like perfect

3303.78 --> 3309.8390000000004
geometric calculations tells you this is

3307.44 --> 3312.2400000000002
impossible so I'm sure that the

3309.839 --> 3315.54
geometric calculator computer program

3312.24 --> 3317.9399999999996
can't do it but you can do it right you

3315.54 --> 3320.339
can Globe Fundy [ __ ] with

3317.94 --> 3323.7000000000003
think they're a God but they're just

3320.339 --> 3326.7599999999998
delusional huh so you tell me how you do

3323.7 --> 3328.64
it then numpty [ __ ]

3326.76 --> 3330.96
huh

3328.64 --> 3333.48
yes yes

3330.96 --> 3337.2
yeah throw it back at me don't actually

3333.48 --> 3340.079
answer the question numpty [ __ ]

3337.2 --> 3343.5589999999997
yeah don't actually tell me how you are

3340.079 --> 3346.38
going to improve upon that geometric

3343.559 --> 3350.579
calculation computer program that gives

3346.38 --> 3354.2400000000002
you a syntax error huh you can do it I'm

3350.579 --> 3357.7200000000003
sure you can right so just tell me about

3354.24 --> 3360.1189999999997
how I'm now insulting you

3357.72 --> 3362.04
while you're not answering the question

3360.119 --> 3364.98
you're not addressing it you're just

3362.04 --> 3367.079
squirming like a Fundy [ __ ] Wit that's

3364.98 --> 3370.26
gonna get banned by the way

3367.079 --> 3373.02
I just wanted to dangle you

3370.26 --> 3375.42
some above the fire to smoke you before

3373.02 --> 3379.2
I just drop you in and watch you

3375.42 --> 3379.2000000000003
incinerate huh

3380.64 --> 3387.1189999999997
yes yes Fundy [ __ ] whip

3384.0 --> 3388.5
you suck I know it just hurts doesn't it

3387.119 --> 3392.1600000000003
it hurts

3388.5 --> 3395.339
when specifically designated geometric

3392.16 --> 3398.94
calculator computer programs tell you

3395.339 --> 3402.299
you can't do it but you need it a new

3398.94 --> 3405.359
little Globe your little Globe that's

3402.299 --> 3407.7599999999998
geometrically not there it can't be

3405.359 --> 3411.72
calculated yeah sextants are used though

3407.76 --> 3415.1400000000003
an elevation angles are being calculated

3411.72 --> 3418.6189999999997
just not to a curve the adjacent because

3415.14 --> 3420.54
it isn't it's straight it's a straight

3418.619 --> 3422.099
adjacent oh now you can't get that

3420.54 --> 3424.2
elevation angle yeah

3422.099 --> 3426.42
because the Earth is flat ah funny

3424.2 --> 3429.48
[ __ ] huh

3426.42 --> 3434.4
can you feel the pain when the geometric

3429.48 --> 3436.92
calculator program specifically made to

3434.4 --> 3440.1600000000003
show you perfect calculations

3436.92 --> 3442.26
how it tells you you can't do that you

3440.16 --> 3446.94
dumb [ __ ]

3442.26 --> 3450.48
yeah syntax error funny [ __ ] yeah

3446.94 --> 3453.48
yeah bite bite on it it's called pain

3450.48 --> 3456.0
it's called your religion is broken

3453.48 --> 3458.52
the geometric calculator tells you

3456.0 --> 3461.099
that's impossible you would need it

3458.52 --> 3462.599
though if you wanted to use a sexton on

3461.099 --> 3465.96
a globe

3462.599 --> 3469.319
but yeah you can't get it it's

3465.96 --> 3472.92
impossible on the globe syntax error the

3469.319 --> 3474.42
geometric calculator proves that yeah so

3472.92 --> 3477.7200000000003
how are you going to get that on your

3474.42 --> 3481.079
Globe oh you can't yeah I know because

3477.72 --> 3483.9599999999996
you're not on a globe you're on a flat

3481.079 --> 3486.7200000000003
plane and that's why the Sextant works

3483.96 --> 3490.7400000000002
it doesn't work on the glow

3486.72 --> 3493.859
yeah even your computer programs

3490.74 --> 3496.02
specifically designated and created to

3493.859 --> 3498.7799999999997
take over some of the geometry

3496.02 --> 3502.44
calculation effort to do some of that

3498.78 --> 3505.4
for you it tells you you can't do it you

3502.44 --> 3505.4
dumb [ __ ]

3506.37 --> 3512.3889999999997
[Music]

3519.24 --> 3522.2
ah

3525.559 --> 3531.48
look at them projecting they're like

3529.31 --> 3534.42
[Music]

3531.48 --> 3537.839
scatter gunning projecting oh they're

3534.42 --> 3541.14
garbage all their internal vomit all

3537.839 --> 3543.9
coming out look at them squared for us

3541.14 --> 3547.0989999999997
you dumb [ __ ] you're dumb [ __ ] you're

3543.9 --> 3550.92
wrong you're fundamentally

3547.099 --> 3554.339
mechanically logically wrong from all

3550.92 --> 3556.98
sides and you're too [ __ ] [ __ ] to

3554.339 --> 3560.16
stop yourself from keeping gushing on

3556.98 --> 3563.76
the live vomit vomit vomit you're a liar

3560.16 --> 3565.2599999999998
you dumb [ __ ] stop lying to yourself you

3563.76 --> 3568.8590000000004
dumb [ __ ]

3565.26 --> 3572.119
the Earth is flat you can't use the

3568.859 --> 3575.54
Sextant on a globe even your geometric

3572.119 --> 3580.339
calculation programs tell you you can't

3575.54 --> 3580.339
let it go you dumb [ __ ]

3592.5 --> 3598.14
it's getting old it's getting whole old

3595.38 --> 3601.799
watching you funny [ __ ] keep

3598.14 --> 3604.68
projecting and projectile squirting

3601.799 --> 3607.38
like soon somebody get a bit passionate

3604.68 --> 3609.359
might address you as like a funny [ __ ]

3607.38 --> 3611.819
with which you are by your

3609.359 --> 3614.16
Communications it's right there for

3611.819 --> 3616.44
everybody to see you're dumb you're

3614.16 --> 3619.319
projecting everybody can see it

3616.44 --> 3621.78
so complain some more about how I'm

3619.319 --> 3625.079
talking about how I don't have arguments

3621.78 --> 3629.099
even though I just laid down like every

3625.079 --> 3630.9
painful little empirical detail about

3629.099 --> 3633.7200000000003
this argument

3630.9 --> 3638.48
right in your face and there's nothing

3633.72 --> 3641.0989999999997
you can do about it you're just wrong

3638.48 --> 3642.54
you dumb [ __ ]

3641.099 --> 3645.5
huh

3642.54 --> 3645.5
deal with it

3650.26 --> 3654.099
[Music]

3658.91 --> 3662.1789999999996
[Music]

3663.48 --> 3669.079
yeah I don't doctor

3665.9 --> 3669.079
[ __ ] off

3670.319 --> 3674.64
are you threatening me now you dumb [ __ ]

3672.359 --> 3677.2799999999997
huh

3674.64 --> 3680.4
get out of here

3677.28 --> 3683.5400000000004
oh yeah and your brand stinks

3680.4 --> 3683.54
you stink

3697.559 --> 3701.7000000000003
thanks for bearing with me there guys

3699.24 --> 3704.16
just

3701.7 --> 3708.2599999999998
needed to

3704.16 --> 3708.2599999999998
put some goblins in their place

3725.0 --> 3730.64
yeah I know that that was funny akumo

3728.28 --> 3730.6400000000003
virus

3732.48 --> 3737.599
it's funny to just shove it right in

3735.18 --> 3737.5989999999997
their face

3741.9 --> 3746.96
black

3744.119 --> 3746.96
what's that

3759.119 --> 3767.119
black managed to obtain something by

3762.539 --> 3767.119
using persuasion or guile huh

3767.4 --> 3770.359
who's that black

3773.039 --> 3776.039
foreign

3776.94 --> 3782.42
yeah followers are attacking geometry

3779.819 --> 3782.42
aren't they

3787.799 --> 3794.0389999999998
what's a curved adjacent what it's

3791.339 --> 3797.0589999999997
really a cool move you're gonna do this

3794.039 --> 3797.059
you're gonna do that

3797.64 --> 3801.1189999999997
I mean

3799.079 --> 3803.819
the whole Fundy [ __ ] wait and all that

3801.119 --> 3806.28
wasn't even talking to you I know you're

3803.819 --> 3809.46
like an eternal punching bag that never

3806.28 --> 3811.8590000000004
gives up and you will always satisfy in

3809.46 --> 3812.94
the sense that you will tire out your

3811.859 --> 3817.0389999999998
opponent

3812.94 --> 3818.579
as you're like squirming and squeaking

3817.039 --> 3821.6400000000003
yeah

3818.579 --> 3823.7400000000002
heard it third hours of it but I wasn't

3821.64 --> 3826.0789999999997
actually like

3823.74 --> 3831.0789999999997
addressing you I was addressing some of

3826.079 --> 3831.079
these other chat skanking numpy [ __ ]

3849.119 --> 3859.2200000000003
that chase inside of a triangle now

3853.44 --> 3859.2200000000003
elevation angle with a curved Baseline

3860.9 --> 3866.28
I know it's very easy for you to

3863.64 --> 3868.5589999999997
completely forget the entire premise of

3866.28 --> 3870.299
what you're doing in order to Scurry off

3868.559 --> 3871.98
to some other little corner of train

3870.299 --> 3874.74
thinking that has nothing to do with the

3871.98 --> 3876.539
original premise akumu

3874.74 --> 3879.839
but yeah it's nothing to do with what

3876.539 --> 3883.8590000000004
you're talking about we're talking about

3879.839 --> 3887.339
getting in an elevation angle of a

3883.859 --> 3887.339
curved Baseline

3899.76 --> 3905.8190000000004
curved adjacent no curved Baseline

3903.539 --> 3908.3390000000004
elevation angle

3905.819 --> 3911.339
curved

3908.339 --> 3911.339
Baseline

3916.5 --> 3923.099
too much swearing in the show

3919.859 --> 3924.7799999999997
yeah well steamy traveler look

3923.099 --> 3928.44
that's

3924.78 --> 3931.2000000000003
what can you do I mean this show is not

3928.44 --> 3934.92
meant for kids I don't know why you

3931.2 --> 3936.96
think you want to show my show to kids

3934.92 --> 3939.42
this is 12 plus

3936.96 --> 3942.059
I will be swearing I will be setting

3939.42 --> 3943.44
examples that are not meant to be shown

3942.059 --> 3946.8590000000004
to kids

3943.44 --> 3949.68
get very passionate get very angry it's

3946.859 --> 3952.319
not meant for kids

3949.68 --> 3954.0
it's just that's how it is that's not

3952.319 --> 3955.98
going to change

3954.0 --> 3959.16
you understand

3955.98 --> 3960.839
that's what I do I'm not going to change

3959.16 --> 3964.2
it

3960.839 --> 3966.359
like even if I could I still want

3964.2 --> 3969.4199999999996
I'm going to do this

3966.359 --> 3972.96
I'm going to do it like this I try to

3969.42 --> 3976.319
improve within what I do but I'm not

3972.96 --> 3978.9
going to like oh this part is oh there's

3976.319 --> 3981.0
a disadvantage for the long run I'm

3978.9 --> 3984.6600000000003
going to just turn it off oh it doesn't

3981.0 --> 3985.619
exist you know yeah no no I'm going to

3984.66 --> 3987.8999999999996
be

3985.619 --> 3992.039
very intense

3987.9 --> 3996.2400000000002
seemingly out of control at times loud I

3992.039 --> 4001.599
will curse I'll be extremely angry at

3996.24 --> 4004.0389999999998
times I will be seething and like

4001.599 --> 4006.1400000000003
possessed with Wrath

4004.039 --> 4008.78
towards people that I really think

4006.14 --> 4011.859
deserve that

4008.78 --> 4011.8590000000004
that's what I am

4012.619 --> 4018.2000000000003
this is not meant for little kids that's

4015.38 --> 4021.1400000000003
just the way it's going to stay

4018.2 --> 4024.9399999999996
the thing about little kids though is

4021.14 --> 4024.94
eventually they'll grow up

4030.98 --> 4038.92
but yeah little kids shouldn't be

4033.52 --> 4038.92
burdened with what I deal with

4045.44 --> 4049.78
wish I'd seen this when I was a little

4047.599 --> 4049.78
kid

4049.88 --> 4054.619
well look yeah even as a little kid you

4053.0 --> 4058.039
could always be looking for trouble

4054.619 --> 4059.96
right it's just that when I say not for

4058.039 --> 4061.6400000000003
little kids yeah there might be little

4059.96 --> 4063.5
kids that are like

4061.64 --> 4065.42
we want to get this we want to get this

4063.5 --> 4067.94
we want to get it now we want to do it

4065.42 --> 4069.559
right right well they might be tuning in

4067.94 --> 4073.4
and they'll be like hey wait this is

4069.559 --> 4075.619
perfect right I'm talking about kids in

4073.4 --> 4078.26
general right

4075.619 --> 4080.78
I mean the ones that are Seekers that

4078.26 --> 4082.579
are really eager to basically grow up

4080.78 --> 4083.48
and figure things out and get a grasp

4082.579 --> 4085.4
yeah

4083.48 --> 4087.02
but you're not gonna stop them anyway if

4085.4 --> 4089.78
they want to watch something they will

4087.02 --> 4091.7
do it they will not be stopped right I'm

4089.78 --> 4094.76
talking about like

4091.7 --> 4096.3189999999995
just nice General kids that are just

4094.76 --> 4097.9400000000005
like

4096.319 --> 4099.14
what the [ __ ] are they gonna do with

4097.94 --> 4102.08
this

4099.14 --> 4104.299
how is this a good example

4102.08 --> 4106.759
right it isn't

4104.299 --> 4109.5199999999995
my behavior is not exactly a good

4106.759 --> 4112.1
example for young kids

4109.52 --> 4115.88
but if they get a little older

4112.1 --> 4118.1
then like they get the transition of

4115.88 --> 4119.839
hormones like because of puberty

4118.1 --> 4121.759
hopefully

4119.839 --> 4124.159
and they're gonna have like impulses

4121.759 --> 4127.04
they need to deal with learn to deal

4124.159 --> 4128.739
with it and not get caught up in like

4127.04 --> 4132.62
complete

4128.739 --> 4135.199
evacuation or escapism that's

4132.62 --> 4137.3589999999995
where suddenly my influence becomes

4135.199 --> 4140.0
really useful I think

4137.359 --> 4141.5
because I always address that sort of

4140.0 --> 4144.92
thing

4141.5 --> 4147.759
I still struggle with the Echoes of that

4144.92 --> 4147.759
time of my life

4147.92 --> 4154.04
right

4149.779 --> 4157.1
so not young kids but 12 plus

4154.04 --> 4159.2789999999995
that's kind of the vision behind what I

4157.1 --> 4159.279
do

4164.719 --> 4171.5
all right fair enough or look David r

4167.54 --> 4173.6
Rice I wish I would have seen it as a

4171.5 --> 4177.14
little kid

4173.6 --> 4179.54
because as a little kid I was like kind

4177.14 --> 4182.779
of left to my devices in a liberal

4179.54 --> 4184.64
environment with nobody to really be

4182.779 --> 4188.299000000001
strict and correcting

4184.64 --> 4191.359
other than dumb superficial [ __ ]

4188.299 --> 4194.0
so if I would have been present back

4191.359 --> 4196.52
then like

4194.0 --> 4199.64
35 years ago

4196.52 --> 4202.46
the way I am now I would have totally

4199.64 --> 4205.46
been like oh my God finally the right

4202.46 --> 4209.08
guy that's finally doing it right

4205.46 --> 4209.08
right yeah

4209.84 --> 4218.179
I get that but times have changed though

4213.699 --> 4220.46
it isn't like 35 years ago

4218.179 --> 4224.179
the people are now

4220.46 --> 4226.159
and young kids are like much more

4224.179 --> 4228.4400000000005
like

4226.159 --> 4231.199
engaged

4228.44 --> 4233.178999999999
brought closer to the darkness than even

4231.199 --> 4234.799999999999
I was in that time

4233.179 --> 4238.2390000000005
so they're gonna have like different

4234.8 --> 4238.2390000000005
responses different

4238.46 --> 4242.08
way of development

4245.0 --> 4248.32
demon alert what

4253.34 --> 4256.12
what happened

4285.14 --> 4292.46
right besides look

4288.679 --> 4294.1990000000005
if you'd be like wow this guy like seems

4292.46 --> 4296.2390000000005
to know a lot about Flat Earth and he's

4294.199 --> 4298.04
talking about the holographic skies and

4296.239 --> 4300.0199999999995
it's all so complicated but he really

4298.04 --> 4302.659
seems to be certain about himself and he

4300.02 --> 4304.280000000001
can explain it like yeah if you want

4302.659 --> 4306.92
your kids to like

4304.28 --> 4309.92
learn specifically about complicated

4306.92 --> 4312.92
things like that then I am kind of

4309.92 --> 4314.9
available to be like a more personal

4312.92 --> 4317.06
teacher right

4314.9 --> 4320.9
doesn't mean like oh yeah just send them

4317.06 --> 4324.02
over to my chat no it's not that kind of

4320.9 --> 4326.839999999999
a show but I would be like okay

4324.02 --> 4330.4400000000005
could just have a talk over Skype right

4326.84 --> 4332.12
or even meet face to face in person if

4330.44 --> 4337.219
you're like in the Netherlands

4332.12 --> 4339.98
and I'd be I I can like face them

4337.219 --> 4343.46
like teach kids that are younger like

4339.98 --> 4344.839999999999
help them understand these things

4343.46 --> 4346.52
all the more

4344.84 --> 4350.42
yeah

4346.52 --> 4352.6990000000005
personal Tinker tailored fashion I can't

4350.42 --> 4356.12
do that it's just not something I do

4352.699 --> 4358.699
here on my platform

4356.12 --> 4360.679
when I'm addressing addressing much

4358.699 --> 4365.799999999999
wider things right it's very different

4360.679 --> 4365.8
from personal teaching I can do that

4367.699 --> 4373.04
I've done it before

4370.52 --> 4376.2390000000005
if they really want to know they have

4373.04 --> 4379.96
questions I can answer every question

4376.239 --> 4379.959999999999
exactly to their level

4380.48 --> 4386.12
and Beyond

4382.58 --> 4388.699
so right it's not like I'm saying like

4386.12 --> 4389.9
there are never kids like never drink

4388.699 --> 4392.659
kits

4389.9 --> 4394.94
to me with this like no I can't do that

4392.659 --> 4397.28
it's just don't throw them in the middle

4394.94 --> 4400.46
of this chat or something right

4397.28 --> 4404.5
because there is trolls and we are

4400.46 --> 4404.5
adults things get a little adult

4406.699 --> 4414.94
I try to prevent it from sliding even

4410.179 --> 4414.9400000000005
further there of course common decency

4415.88 --> 4419.84
even adults can't handle the truth well

4417.98 --> 4422.0199999999995
then they're not really adults now are

4419.84 --> 4422.02
they

4423.98 --> 4428.44
I mean they've grown up they just

4430.28 --> 4435.04
didn't know didn't grow up mentally

4451.699 --> 4457.839999999999
teacher talked to read this

4455.12 --> 4457.84
hmm

4468.44 --> 4473.299999999999
it's funny by the way because even like

4470.78 --> 4475.219
I think like six years ago I even on

4473.3 --> 4477.62
flatter talks at one point was asked

4475.219 --> 4478.76
such a thing and be like yeah sure if

4477.62 --> 4481.34
like

4478.76 --> 4484.04
if you could now like

4481.34 --> 4486.679
be condoned to like teach about letters

4484.04 --> 4488.84
the kids in like the regular system if

4486.679 --> 4491.4800000000005
that was like

4488.84 --> 4494.4800000000005
green lighted somehow then yeah I'd be

4491.48 --> 4497.718999999999
like okay I can teach this subject

4494.48 --> 4499.94
or whoever is going to like want me to

4497.719 --> 4501.08
be part of their curriculum and I can do

4499.94 --> 4503.36
that

4501.08 --> 4505.5199999999995
I will teach them about Flat Earth on a

4503.36 --> 4507.739
very personal level and the psychology

4505.52 --> 4511.34
and everything that actually comes

4507.739 --> 4512.959999999999
involved with that I can apply

4511.34 --> 4515.719
all of it

4512.96 --> 4519.26
I can be a very effective like letter

4515.719 --> 4522.02
teacher I know I can I suspected that I

4519.26 --> 4525.6990000000005
would seven years ago six years ago but

4522.02 --> 4525.6990000000005
I know I can right now

4525.8 --> 4529.06
I can do that

4537.62 --> 4543.44
if it ever came to that like facing a

4540.98 --> 4545.239
class in person and all that I couldn't

4543.44 --> 4549.4
do that I can teach them a lot better

4545.239 --> 4549.4
and everything that I've learned

4549.44 --> 4552.4
uh

4554.179 --> 4559.159
I'd probably couldn't help but get

4557.0 --> 4561.86
involved with also like alternative

4559.159 --> 4563.659
medical advice and such and that might

4561.86 --> 4564.62
get me into trouble still because I

4563.659 --> 4567.5199999999995
don't think that's going to go away

4564.62 --> 4567.5199999999995
anytime soon

4575.54 --> 4580.659
all right so I'm just sticking to

4577.699 --> 4580.659
YouTube for now

4582.33 --> 4585.5289999999995
[Music]

4588.8 --> 4592.4800000000005
ah man I'm getting hungry

4611.5 --> 4617.56
listening to what

4615.26 --> 4617.56
foreign

4655.1 --> 4658.1
message

4669.14 --> 4674.4800000000005
they need like simple

4671.9 --> 4676.879999999999
approach programming

4674.48 --> 4680.718999999999
well if they're very young right because

4676.88 --> 4683.0
it all depends on them like how Dynamic

4680.719 --> 4685.88
naturally their minds are

4683.0 --> 4687.98
like me as a kid I was like hyper

4685.88 --> 4690.7390000000005
Dynamic and Technical as a kid like

4687.98 --> 4694.099999999999
really quick even though I didn't even

4690.739 --> 4696.799999999999
grasp the language the like the that

4694.1 --> 4699.8
room to be very detailed and Technical

4696.8 --> 4702.56
and analytical was already there

4699.8 --> 4706.54
like almost before I even learn how to

4702.56 --> 4706.54
talk it was just there it's part of me

4713.36 --> 4717.98
it was like always something going on in

4716.0 --> 4720.679
there right it's never nothing it's

4717.98 --> 4723.0199999999995
never just like uh

4720.679 --> 4725.659
like except for when I was like watching

4723.02 --> 4728.900000000001
TV then that really like didn't do me

4725.659 --> 4731.0599999999995
any good it slowed me down

4728.9 --> 4732.44
and if I was like in moments and I have

4731.06 --> 4735.320000000001
had those moments where I was like

4732.44 --> 4737.48
actually being like a TV Junkie then it

4735.32 --> 4740.0
would literally make me depressed not

4737.48 --> 4742.459999999999
emotionally it would just like

4740.0 --> 4745.9
make me slow

4742.46 --> 4745.9
really it did that

4749.84 --> 4754.58
so I'm really glad that I don't watch TV

4752.179 --> 4757.12
anymore now I never have those moments

4754.58 --> 4757.12
never

4758.6 --> 4763.04
right at in the TV if you're watching

4761.179 --> 4765.26
something then you have this dilemma

4763.04 --> 4768.86
like oh I could just step away but then

4765.26 --> 4770.54
I'd miss the rest so you kind of get

4768.86 --> 4772.5199999999995
caught in situations where you're sort

4770.54 --> 4774.14
of forcing yourself to keep watching so

4772.52 --> 4775.360000000001
you don't miss anything

4774.14 --> 4778.76
right

4775.36 --> 4782.48
on the internet you have this

4778.76 --> 4782.4800000000005
Fantastical luxury

4782.54 --> 4787.64
and by the way even already with VCRs

4785.239 --> 4791.0599999999995
and DVDs of like you can just pause it

4787.64 --> 4792.92
so you can actually step away if you

4791.06 --> 4795.38
really have that impulse like I need a

4792.92 --> 4797.3
moment separate from this you're not

4795.38 --> 4798.9800000000005
like pulled in like oh I can't miss it

4797.3 --> 4802.219
right

4798.98 --> 4804.98
that was like a really big Hazard of

4802.219 --> 4806.719
watching TV a lot that most of you that

4804.98 --> 4808.58
don't no longer watch TV have probably

4806.719 --> 4811.04
forgotten about that

4808.58 --> 4813.26
that that does happen like you had to

4811.04 --> 4815.3
keep watching because if you stopped

4813.26 --> 4817.639
watching for whatever reason you'd miss

4815.3 --> 4820.179
it well you don't really have that issue

4817.639 --> 4820.179
anymore now

4821.239 --> 4826.9
but that was an issue back then

4823.94 --> 4826.9
even for me

4828.199 --> 4832.82
it would make you watch it even if you

4831.199 --> 4836.62
kind of wanted to do something else

4832.82 --> 4836.62
because you didn't want to miss it

4837.38 --> 4839.86
anyway

4863.6 --> 4870.46
that it's in all right angles do a plumb

4866.9 --> 4870.46
bob yeah everywhere

4872.42 --> 4875.42
foreign

4878.12 --> 4883.9
because it's flat Earth is flat

4880.94 --> 4883.9
everywhere

4885.38 --> 4890.4800000000005
Celestial navigation wouldn't work if it

4887.96 --> 4893.2390000000005
wasn't thank God the Earth is flat

4890.48 --> 4895.58
otherwise we wouldn't have had Celestial

4893.239 --> 4898.58
navigation it wouldn't have worked

4895.58 --> 4900.62
but it does thanks to the Earth being

4898.58 --> 4903.82
flat

4900.62 --> 4903.82
aren't we just lucky

4914.48 --> 4921.0199999999995
the birds are eating plums from the tree

4917.78 --> 4925.3
uh steaming there's only one way I know

4921.02 --> 4925.3
how to stop that and that is using Nets

4925.76 --> 4929.139
and it's quite a hassle

4935.48 --> 4939.86
yeah

4936.56 --> 4942.56
but but I know what you mean like plums

4939.86 --> 4944.719
or cherries especially cherries there's

4942.56 --> 4947.179
like birds that really like to go after

4944.719 --> 4949.639
those the only way to really get it off

4947.179 --> 4951.62
is by using Nets

4949.639 --> 4953.54
but that's like quite a hassle to put

4951.62 --> 4958.179
all that on so

4953.54 --> 4958.179
is that worth it you'll be the judge

4975.98 --> 4982.04
help scare birds

4979.04 --> 4982.04
whoa

4982.28 --> 4987.8
you could have like a motion detector

4984.8 --> 4991.2390000000005
and like a a bang machine too

4987.8 --> 4991.2390000000005
it's a bit dramatic

4992.06 --> 4995.320000000001
you could do that

5005.08 --> 5010.3
fake out yeah now that doesn't work if

5008.38 --> 5012.88
another Bird's not gonna scare them off

5010.3 --> 5015.6990000000005
from doing that

5012.88 --> 5018.9400000000005
so either just like a bang machine like

5015.699 --> 5020.5
it's a motion detector like in the tree

5018.94 --> 5023.199
and suddenly it's just gonna be like

5020.5 --> 5025.06
Bang Yeah that's gonna freak they're

5023.199 --> 5026.86
gonna have heart attacks even some of

5025.06 --> 5028.6
them maybe

5026.86 --> 5031.42
but then they're gonna probably stay

5028.6 --> 5034.120000000001
away because they will not be hungry in

5031.42 --> 5036.82
the proximity of that anymore because of

5034.12 --> 5039.159
the scare that's there right

5036.82 --> 5042.04
or you have to do with Nets

5039.159 --> 5045.719
and then they just can't get in but it's

5042.04 --> 5048.639
quite a lot of work putting that on

5045.719 --> 5051.36
usually depending of course on how big

5048.639 --> 5051.36
your tree is

5076.659 --> 5081.4
right so yeah if you're gonna use a bang

5078.94 --> 5083.739
machine to make sure it's not like right

5081.4 --> 5086.679
next to your chicken house or something

5083.739 --> 5090.099999999999
because that's not gonna help

5086.679 --> 5093.76
if you have like farm animals close by

5090.1 --> 5095.7390000000005
that tree where you want to do that then

5093.76 --> 5097.96
I wouldn't use a bang machine because

5095.739 --> 5101.4
it's gonna screw your

5097.96 --> 5101.4
your farm animals up

anything with reflective

5144.219 --> 5147.179
interesting

5166.32 --> 5171.94
that's interesting and thought of that

5169.239 --> 5174.879999999999
church Sanford yeah well if you could

5171.94 --> 5177.879999999999
have like combine a motion detector with

5174.88 --> 5180.400000000001
like a sort of a mirror setup

5177.88 --> 5182.56
that then moves so that there will be

5180.4 --> 5184.719
like light Reflections and all that hap

5182.56 --> 5186.52
that's certainly gonna like really freak

5184.719 --> 5189.159
them out

5186.52 --> 5190.120000000001
especially like if it moves when they

5189.159 --> 5192.82
approach

5190.12 --> 5197.139
right it's the sudden movement that can

5192.82 --> 5199.54
also get to them besides loud bangs

5197.139 --> 5201.46
so that's that's also an interesting

5199.54 --> 5204.219
alternative

5201.46 --> 5206.9800000000005
it would be better like if your fruit

5204.219 --> 5208.2390000000005
tree is closer to like hen house and all

5206.98 --> 5209.678999999999
that

5208.239 --> 5212.138999999999
because you don't have to have a loud

5209.679 --> 5214.719
bang then that might work too

5212.139 --> 5216.88
but yeah the oldest way that I know is

5214.719 --> 5219.46
just using Nets

5216.88 --> 5221.26
it's it's quite a shitty task to get it

5219.46 --> 5223.78
on there but if you've got it on there

5221.26 --> 5225.280000000001
then it's kind of over

5223.78 --> 5229.139

5290.92 --> 5294.52
right Birds would more likely sort of

5293.08 --> 5297.82
figure out something that moved with the

5294.52 --> 5300.639
sensor is in a threat right because

5297.82 --> 5302.799999999999
they're all very skinny or sudden

5300.639 --> 5305.1990000000005
movement especially unexpected movement

5302.8 --> 5307.0
right that's like the Predator waiting

5305.199 --> 5309.46
in the shadow invisible suddenly

5307.0 --> 5312.58
striking out at them all of those bird

5309.46 --> 5316.179
types have reflexes like that

5312.58 --> 5318.82
so if it's just a creature sitting there

5316.179 --> 5320.56
supposedly or a puppet they're gonna fit

5318.82 --> 5323.219
it's not gonna move they might be

5320.56 --> 5325.659000000001
nervous but it's this sudden movement

5323.219 --> 5327.34
especially if it's close by when they

5325.659 --> 5328.589999999999
are close by that's gonna really freak

[Music]

5350.88 --> 5356.5
I thought of something silly

5354.1 --> 5359.4400000000005
you could basically have like a disco

5356.5 --> 5362.56
ball with a motion detector

5359.44 --> 5364.839999999999
just in that tree so my thumbs and

5362.56 --> 5366.9400000000005
clumps close it starts turning and then

5364.84 --> 5370.360000000001
yeah the reflections is gonna

5366.94 --> 5372.58
scatter out it could be that basic I

5370.36 --> 5377.099999999999
don't know if that will work though with

5372.58 --> 5377.1
a disco ball sounds really silly

5413.26 --> 5419.18
Saturday Night Fever in the plum tree

5415.739 --> 5422.199

5425.32 --> 5431.259999999999
it's like oh damn the rollerblader birds

5428.62 --> 5435.84
are paying a visit to my Plum Tree again

5431.26 --> 5435.84
because the Disco Balls going off

5437.98 --> 5442.718999999999
and maybe you could even like have a

5439.9 --> 5447.54
disco song play alongside that that's

5442.719 --> 5447.54
getting totally ridiculous don't do that

5456.82 --> 5462.82
but yeah now I have in my head like

5460.42 --> 5464.56
you're just sitting there in your yard

5462.82 --> 5468.04
or something and then somebody like

5464.56 --> 5473.320000000001
disco ball starts going and then you

5468.04 --> 5475.719
make me feel so mighty real it's like oh

5473.32 --> 5477.84
this does freaking rollerblader Birds

5475.719 --> 5477.84
again

5482.26 --> 5487.360000000001
I'm not gonna try to do that again

5484.659 --> 5490.0199999999995
it sucks but that song is like very

5487.36 --> 5490.0199999999995
tenacious

5490.78 --> 5494.62
and gay uh

5498.1 --> 5504.96
hey psych Bear yeah

5501.159 --> 5504.96
I thought you'd appreciate that

5528.58 --> 5531.48
wow

5536.38 --> 5542.32
yeah pigeons pigeons can be a big tests

5540.159 --> 5544.54
it all depends though on who are feeding

5542.32 --> 5547.84
them because it's the people usually

5544.54 --> 5551.5199999999995
just giving them food all the time that

5547.84 --> 5551.52
really turns them into a pest

5553.0 --> 5555.54
like

5556.96 --> 5563.38
over here in the Netherlands that's

5559.6 --> 5567.76
noticed so like in the city overall in

5563.38 --> 5570.639
bigger cities it's like not allowed to

5567.76 --> 5572.139
feed the pigeons like you're not allowed

5570.639 --> 5574.36
to actually do that

5572.139 --> 5576.84
sometimes there's even signs like don't

5574.36 --> 5576.839999999999
do that

5577.0 --> 5582.58
and so yeah

5578.739 --> 5586.54
there's not a huge swarm of pigeons that

5582.58 --> 5589.659
just [ __ ] on everything constantly here

5586.54 --> 5592.659
because we don't people aren't like oh

5589.659 --> 5594.5199999999995
pigeon I want to give them some bread no

5592.659 --> 5598.98
don't do that

5594.52 --> 5598.9800000000005
it literally turns them into a plague

5611.56 --> 5615.2390000000005
you dare not have a hole in your room

5626.62 --> 5631.0599999999995
pictures give birth to Bad Name well not

5628.96 --> 5632.9800000000005
all pigeons I mean you have the white

5631.06 --> 5635.5
doves they're great

5632.98 --> 5638.199
beautiful

5635.5 --> 5642.159
very beautiful very eloquent

5638.199 --> 5645.0
elegant I mean uh

5642.159 --> 5649.179
it's just kind of like the big

5645.0 --> 5651.52
gray fat pigeons that are very loud and

5649.179 --> 5654.28
like dumb and like they often just fly

5651.52 --> 5656.320000000001
into windows and [ __ ]

5654.28 --> 5658.54
those types of pigeons those would

5656.32 --> 5662.159
usually turn into a plague

5658.54 --> 5662.159
because people feed them

5676.48 --> 5680.739
[ __ ] and start talking yeah that's why

5678.159 --> 5683.339999999999
I said elegant

5680.739 --> 5683.339999999999
yes

5684.1 --> 5689.1990000000005
they do talk by the way oh Birds saw

5687.04 --> 5691.36
animals do talk they just don't use

5689.199 --> 5694.32
language

5691.36 --> 5694.32
like we do

5696.76 --> 5702.58
but like intonation and expression it

5699.699 --> 5704.86
tells a lot so they absolutely do

5702.58 --> 5707.32
communicate and I have learned to read

5704.86 --> 5708.599999999999
some of it you can like even read like

5707.32 --> 5712.239
The

5708.6 --> 5715.719
emotional sensory sophistication of a

5712.239 --> 5717.339999999999
bird by the way it communicates I can at

5715.719 --> 5720.119
least

5717.34 --> 5720.119000000001
hmm

5746.8 --> 5751.3
right homing pit yeah those are the

5748.84 --> 5754.78
white the doves

5751.3 --> 5757.659000000001
and they're like real they are like bred

5754.78 --> 5759.5199999999995
to be to always go to the same spot

5757.659 --> 5761.94
that's how they were used as messenger

5759.52 --> 5761.9400000000005
Birds

5762.04 --> 5766.199
like for a very long time

5775.42 --> 5779.32
yeah I bet they still are used here and

5778.06 --> 5781.4800000000005
there

5779.32 --> 5783.699
I mean like what's stopping you from

5781.48 --> 5787.299999999999
doing that it just

5783.699 --> 5792.219
take it off put it in a cage

5787.3 --> 5794.860000000001
move it give it to somebody else

5792.219 --> 5796.659
that also I can't takes care of pigeons

5794.86 --> 5799.78
that he keeps it

5796.659 --> 5802.36
and then like oh you need a message to

5799.78 --> 5805.119
send to that guy okay just put a piece

5802.36 --> 5807.699
of paper on the leg and let it go and

5805.119 --> 5810.719
it's gonna fly straight back pretty much

5807.699 --> 5810.719
no matter the distance

5811.06 --> 5814.06
because they never forget where they

5812.8 --> 5817.9800000000005
came from

5814.06 --> 5817.9800000000005
one of their interesting traits

5833.98 --> 5843.82
your mother is a crazy bird lady oh God

5838.719 --> 5846.159
so she feeds pinions pigeons does she

5843.82 --> 5849.28
that's usually what crazy bird ladies do

5846.159 --> 5852.099999999999
unless they like collecting parrots in

5849.28 --> 5857.58
like their entire house is just a zoo

5852.1 --> 5857.58
and that sort of crazy bird lady

5870.639 --> 5873.639
no

5876.28 --> 5881.5599999999995
Blue Marble science

5878.5 --> 5883.84
an excellent video I'm sorry that's just

5881.56 --> 5886.92
immediately no

5883.84 --> 5886.92
just know

5895.9 --> 5901.08
pitch an account for coriolis no no not

5898.719 --> 5901.08
at all

5905.619 --> 5912.5689999999995
it does count for like magnetics though

5909.26 --> 5912.569
[Music]

5916.679 --> 5920.58
I'll be right back in two minutes

5921.1 --> 5924.1
foreign

6014.46 --> 6016.76
foreign

6023.34 --> 6026.0
foreign

6042.08 --> 6049.44
no they just have magnetic

6046.02 --> 6051.540000000001
navigation they had literally have like

6049.44 --> 6053.638999999999
a compass that probably they can

6051.54 --> 6057.92
visually see

6053.639 --> 6057.92
they can probably see magnetics

6059.58 --> 6064.0199999999995
maybe they have to specifically tune

6061.86 --> 6066.659
into it maybe it only works high

6064.02 --> 6070.139
altitude that they can really see that

6066.659 --> 6072.96
but I'm I'm I feel fairly certain that

6070.139 --> 6075.96
birds can like see magnetics it's not

6072.96 --> 6079.159
just like oh an intuition no I think

6075.96 --> 6079.159
they can actually see it

6081.36 --> 6087.9
which might be like their brain

6084.54 --> 6090.679
literally just virtually overlaying it

6087.9 --> 6090.679
in their minds

6095.1 --> 6100.139
they're not gonna like see it through

6097.86 --> 6102.96
their eyes

6100.139 --> 6105.4800000000005
but it will probably be like visually

6102.96 --> 6107.28
projected on their minds that's what I

6105.48 --> 6109.82
was saying

6107.28 --> 6109.82
hmm

6126.0 --> 6133.8
ah okay Rufus right okay so she sounds

6129.48 --> 6135.659
like a like a bird zookeeper type she

6133.8 --> 6139.28
just has all the birds and she's like

6135.659 --> 6139.28
really about taking care of them

6139.56 --> 6143.42
just she's like a zookeeper

6155.58 --> 6160.38
the Aries like how is that freaking

6158.58 --> 6164.1
funny

6160.38 --> 6167.6
are you mocking me Aries

6164.1 --> 6167.6
are you just mocking me

6183.239 --> 6188.94
I mean I don't really think that the

6186.54 --> 6191.28
concept of non-local holograms is

6188.94 --> 6196.699
something that should be taken likely or

6191.28 --> 6196.699
joked about since it is a brain breaker

6197.219 --> 6202.7390000000005
so you buy your stance oh could it

6199.98 --> 6204.419999999999
really exist there isn't that yeah

6202.739 --> 6207.54
you're literally mocking it you're

6204.42 --> 6210.54
mocking my entire conception which has

6207.54 --> 6213.179
been brutally difficult

6210.54 --> 6215.159
to get across

6213.179 --> 6218.219
even the guys over at the Flat Earth

6215.159 --> 6220.5
debates are just outright rejecting it

6218.219 --> 6223.7390000000005
entirely

6220.5 --> 6227.46
so you thought that just mocking it like

6223.739 --> 6230.159
that that that's helpful or funny

6227.46 --> 6233.52
I don't think it's funny

6230.159 --> 6236.28
it's been quite a pain in the ass

6233.52 --> 6239.580000000001
even dealing with it being pretty much

6236.28 --> 6242.159
the only one that's even doing that

6239.58 --> 6243.719
and everybody being mostly against me

6242.159 --> 6246.179
about it

6243.719 --> 6248.96
so I don't see how that's funny Aries

6246.179 --> 6248.96
106.

6259.4 --> 6266.04
spiders that use magnetics

6262.4 --> 6270.379999999999
that's not magnetics it's dielectrics

6266.04 --> 6270.38
they use electrostatics kind of

6272.46 --> 6277.58
it's not literally magnetic it's like

6275.159 --> 6277.58
Electric

6278.28 --> 6282.86
but yeah I have taken note of that

6284.159 --> 6289.5599999999995
how do some animals regenerate their own

6286.56 --> 6292.080000000001
electricity well how do we generate our

6289.56 --> 6294.3
electricity because we do

6292.08 --> 6295.679
it's part of what we do it's like the

6294.3 --> 6297.78
body does that

6295.679 --> 6300.06
right when you get really enthusiastic

6297.78 --> 6302.94
when you get really into it what do you

6300.06 --> 6305.34
feel energy what do you think that is I

6302.94 --> 6307.0199999999995
think that's just like an illusory

6305.34 --> 6311.1
sensation

6307.02 --> 6313.56
no that's literally energy that's like

6311.1 --> 6317.400000000001
electricity that is happening there

6313.56 --> 6320.6
you're generating it through your spirit

6317.4 --> 6320.599999999999
in your body

6325.199 --> 6327.678999999999
right

6334.38 --> 6340.26
and yeah some animals just

6337.44 --> 6342.96
have a design where they specifically

6340.26 --> 6347.42
Incorporated

6342.96 --> 6349.9800000000005
as like a standardized tactic right we

6347.42 --> 6351.0
mammals and all that social animals do

6349.98 --> 6353.94
that too

6351.0 --> 6357.9
how do we do it within our automated

6353.94 --> 6359.82
social behavioral routines that's where

6357.9 --> 6361.679
we got that automated

6359.82 --> 6363.239
we don't have like

6361.679 --> 6366.719
special

6363.239 --> 6369.718999999999
like wings or something that we can just

6366.719 --> 6373.139
like oh let's just rub them and then we

6369.719 --> 6375.84
got electrostatic effect or something no

6373.139 --> 6378.84
right it's more insectoid that typically

6375.84 --> 6380.1
tend to do that

6378.84 --> 6383.219
but

6380.1 --> 6385.679
like when animals like go for example

6383.219 --> 6388.08
into mating rituals you bet your ass

6385.679 --> 6391.08
they got electricity going they're

6388.08 --> 6394.34
putting a lot of energy in that

6391.08 --> 6394.34
and it is noticeable

6395.82 --> 6398.96
it is essential

6400.26 --> 6405.780000000001
so they're in general all all types of

6402.96 --> 6409.7390000000005
animals of all kinds of Electro

6405.78 --> 6411.42
electric related effects

6409.739 --> 6415.5599999999995
in them

6411.42 --> 6415.56
that they use standard

6428.76 --> 6431.900000000001
what the hell

6432.0 --> 6436.46
what the hell are you talking about

6433.679 --> 6436.46
Rufus

6446.699 --> 6452.04
Steve oh

6449.28 --> 6455.82
why the [ __ ] are you bringing that

6452.04 --> 6458.5199999999995
[ __ ] up why why is this suddenly

6455.82 --> 6461.159
becoming a part of the conversation why

6458.52 --> 6464.639
did you bring Dr why did you choose to

6461.159 --> 6468.0599999999995
drag in one of the most [ __ ] idiot

6464.639 --> 6470.96
Satanist freaks in the world in my

6468.06 --> 6470.96
freaking chat

6473.76 --> 6478.9400000000005
who the [ __ ] gives a [ __ ]

6479.699 --> 6483.78
that's your fault yeah it is your fault

6481.98 --> 6487.379999999999
[ __ ]

6483.78 --> 6491.9
you would do that Dragon like the worst

6487.38 --> 6491.900000000001
[ __ ] possible akumu virus

6499.679 --> 6502.679
ah

6503.219 --> 6508.02
I mean by the way who the [ __ ] even

6505.139 --> 6511.88
needs to watch Jackass anymore

6508.02 --> 6515.42
we watched jackass every day it's called

6511.88 --> 6515.42
anti-flat earthers

6515.88 --> 6520.4400000000005
I mean you don't physically do it to

6519.42 --> 6523.46
yourself

6520.44 --> 6526.259999999999
but verbally semantically

6523.46 --> 6529.639
psychologically spiritually yeah that's

6526.26 --> 6533.820000000001
the [ __ ] we have to see on a daily basis

6529.639 --> 6537.42
Jack asses looking like jackasses

6533.82 --> 6540.96
behaving like jackasses

6537.42 --> 6544.8
spiritually mutilating themselves

6540.96 --> 6549.54
ironically for our entertainment

6544.8 --> 6551.9400000000005
yeah we deal with jackasses every day

6549.54 --> 6554.28
here

6551.94 --> 6556.32
on the Flat Earth debates

6554.28 --> 6557.639
and on the Flat Earth early bird show

6556.32 --> 6560.099
and others

6557.639 --> 6563.219
who the hell would want to do see

6560.099 --> 6565.32
physical people actually physically do

6563.219 --> 6569.4
that [ __ ] to themselves at this point I

6565.32 --> 6572.5199999999995
mean it was kind of funny in the 90s

6569.4 --> 6573.659
for a very short time after it was like

6572.52 --> 6576.06
yeah

6573.659 --> 6578.82
it would be better if this was just like

6576.06 --> 6581.219
not on the television ever again it

6578.82 --> 6582.719
would be better for Humanity that's what

6581.219 --> 6586.92
I thought about it

6582.719 --> 6590.3
I don't even understand why

6586.92 --> 6590.3
why it's still out there

6593.46 --> 6600.2390000000005
I mean that movie is like

6596.52 --> 6603.06
a forebode of Idiocracy like you can't

6600.239 --> 6606.718999999999
get more blatantly foreboding of

6603.06 --> 6611.06
Idiocracy than jackass

6606.719 --> 6611.06
why the hell would you let that continue

6615.15 --> 6618.349999999999
[Music]

6628.92 --> 6631.46
foreign

6632.96 --> 6637.86
talk the [ __ ] does that have to do with

6636.0 --> 6640.32
it

6637.86 --> 6642.54
it's entertained that makes people money

6640.32 --> 6646.199
Oh you mean just like

6642.54 --> 6648.719
filthy satanic horse doing disgusting

6646.199 --> 6652.86
things

6648.719 --> 6657.08
being like monstrous personalities the

6652.86 --> 6660.54
worst example ever imaginable yeah it's

6657.08 --> 6663.719
entertainment yeah they make money oh

6660.54 --> 6666.659
yeah that's that's a good reason man

6663.719 --> 6669.92
yeah that's great

6666.659 --> 6674.098999999999
that's what we all need more filthy

6669.92 --> 6676.9800000000005
deranged scumbags behaving like demons

6674.099 --> 6679.619000000001
with way too much money and way too

6676.98 --> 6682.44
little Spirit to accomplish anything

6679.619 --> 6684.139
good ever yeah we need more of that

6682.44 --> 6688.44
garbage

6684.139 --> 6691.08
pure wasteful garbage it's all

6688.44 --> 6695.239
just destroyed potential you can't get

6691.08 --> 6695.239
more satanic than that kind of crap

6702.73 --> 6705.91
[Music]

6707.58 --> 6710.659
it's garbage

6722.239 --> 6726.239
hyperbola hourglass

6727.5 --> 6730.46
what

6734.94 --> 6737.598999999999
hmm

6738.179 --> 6741.08
interesting

6748.739 --> 6754.98
yeah but I think I know why a Como virus

6751.619 --> 6758.46
likes jackass because when he watches

6754.98 --> 6760.32
that he it just makes him feel like

6758.46 --> 6764.78
or at least there's people out there

6760.32 --> 6764.78
that are even more [ __ ] than I am

6766.38 --> 6768.92
right

6769.8 --> 6776.54
that'd be the only reason I can imagine

6772.26 --> 6776.54
that would be somewhat legitimate

6782.31 --> 6785.499000000001
[Music]

6788.58 --> 6794.04
I think I'm gonna run out to show

6791.52 --> 6796.92
almost

6794.04 --> 6799.639
oh my God it's just raining or rainy

6796.92 --> 6799.639
uranium

6799.8 --> 6802.400000000001
well

6832.98 --> 6835.638999999999
foreign

6836.219 --> 6841.199
yeah they did on record a lot of people

6839.639 --> 6844.34
did got

6841.199 --> 6844.339999999999
tired watching

6844.5 --> 6850.02
jackass idiots and mimicking themselves

6847.199 --> 6853.5599999999995
even though this distinctly say don't do

6850.02 --> 6855.84
it yeah but people do do it

6853.56 --> 6859.02
they do actually do it because they're

6855.84 --> 6861.96
that [ __ ] up stupid

6859.02 --> 6864.4800000000005
and you're giving them an excuse by

6861.96 --> 6866.599
normalizing just showing like yeah

6864.48 --> 6869.4
you too can be an absolute

6866.599 --> 6871.7390000000005
self-destructive freak and you'll still

6869.4 --> 6873.36
get money from it yeah guess what people

6871.739 --> 6875.159
that are deranged are gonna do they're

6873.36 --> 6877.86
gonna do it then

6875.159 --> 6881.659
that's what happens

6877.86 --> 6881.659
spreading the derangements

6899.88 --> 6901.88
um

6912.239 --> 6918.239
wow psych bear this

6914.76 --> 6920.280000000001
is aimed a little high for kumu maybe

6918.239 --> 6922.5599999999995
I mean

6920.28 --> 6924.119
at after everything that he's been going

6922.56 --> 6925.9800000000005
through

6924.119 --> 6928.619
with Nathaniel I don't think there's

6925.98 --> 6930.419999999999
like anything substantive that he could

6928.619 --> 6933.299999999999
actually admit that it doesn't work

6930.42 --> 6936.54
about the globe at this point you always

6933.3 --> 6939.5
just worm his way around it

6936.54 --> 6941.5199999999995
I mean things can literally be

6939.5 --> 6944.159
self-contradictory within his own

6941.52 --> 6946.860000000001
sentence and he's okay with that

6944.159 --> 6951.138999999999
so why

6946.86 --> 6951.139
if you can go that far

6951.96 --> 6958.32
then why would you admit any flaw ever

6955.139 --> 6960.179
again if you can literally okay to

6958.32 --> 6961.98
yourself double speaking about a

6960.179 --> 6964.1990000000005
singular subject within a singular

6961.98 --> 6967.199
sentence

6964.199 --> 6971.78
if you can okay that then why would you

6967.199 --> 6971.78
ever admit anything ever again

6971.82 --> 6976.699
why would you expect somebody like that

6974.159 --> 6976.699
to do that

7009.32 --> 7013.82
let's scattered

7011.44 --> 7016.82
scatter getting never stopped seeking

7013.82 --> 7019.159
style water it never does

7016.82 --> 7022.94
that's it

7019.159 --> 7025.719
eating the same thing over and over and

7022.94 --> 7025.719
over and over

7036.679 --> 7039.88
oh

7038.78 --> 7043.34
okay

7039.88 --> 7045.02
wow well that's something Maps aren't

7043.34 --> 7048.639
100 right

7045.02 --> 7048.639
it's so land masses

7048.98 --> 7056.119
with some I take it you wanted to say

7052.88 --> 7058.6990000000005
wow I didn't expect that

7056.119 --> 7060.5599999999995
but yeah it's what I've been saying

7058.699 --> 7062.839999999999
there's no map that's perfectly the

7060.56 --> 7066.080000000001
scale there isn't any

7062.84 --> 7068.08
it's glow projected form and it's flat

7066.08 --> 7072.139
disk projected form

7068.08 --> 7075.86
arguably not even even in a rectangular

7072.139 --> 7078.139
looping or assumed to be looping or it's

7075.86 --> 7082.0
not even then it's not perfectly to

7078.139 --> 7082.0
scale which means that yeah

7083.42 --> 7088.099
it's not a perfect geometry Globe it's

7086.42 --> 7090.04
not even perfectly geometrically

7088.099 --> 7091.599
pear-shaped it's not even perfectly

7090.04 --> 7094.82
geometrically

7091.599 --> 7098.42
irregular in the direction of globe no

7094.82 --> 7101.119
it's just not a globe

7098.42 --> 7104.26
at all

7101.119 --> 7104.259999999999
nothing about it

7106.88 --> 7112.099
the only thing that is an apparent Globe

7109.94 --> 7116.239
is the celestials

7112.099 --> 7119.3
which is what the inspiration was to

7116.239 --> 7121.58
even establish a globe Earth model is

7119.3 --> 7125.0
based on the celestials and could have

7121.58 --> 7126.44
only been measured and calculated and

7125.0 --> 7130.219
put together

7126.44 --> 7133.28
as the Earth is flat

7130.219 --> 7136.699
the Earth wasn't flat then the globe

7133.28 --> 7139.46
model as you know it could have never

7136.699 --> 7143.239
been fabricated

7139.46 --> 7146.3
through geometry and math you understand

7143.239 --> 7150.5599999999995
the Earth wasn't flat and the globe

7146.3 --> 7152.4800000000005
model could never have been created

7150.56 --> 7155.320000000001
huh

7152.48 --> 7155.32
that's great

7179.659 --> 7185.598999999999
what

7182.119 --> 7188.719
that's literally parts of land masses we

7185.599 --> 7190.099
can't act what the [ __ ]

7188.719 --> 7191.84
what

7190.099 --> 7195.6990000000005
the hell

7191.84 --> 7195.6990000000005
are you talking about akumo

7197.06 --> 7203.599
like dude yeah I think that the

7201.139 --> 7205.639
what Jeff gas had said absolutely

7203.599 --> 7208.159000000001
applies you don't even understand your

7205.639 --> 7211.159000000001
own BS like

7208.159 --> 7215.78
it's not about skill that's literally

7211.159 --> 7218.98
parts of land masses we can't act what

7215.78 --> 7218.98
the [ __ ] dude

7220.04 --> 7227.0
like

7222.02 --> 7229.900000000001
how is that even a cohesive sentence

7227.0 --> 7229.9
akumu

7247.58 --> 7253.94
okay there well there's literally parts

7251.36 --> 7255.98
of land masses we can't exit how the

7253.94 --> 7260.119
hell does that make your sentence any

7255.98 --> 7262.82
more logical or correct akumu virus

7260.119 --> 7265.759999999999
you think you live on a globe right so

7262.82 --> 7271.28
how the [ __ ]

7265.76 --> 7274.639
are parts of land masses inaccessible on

7271.28 --> 7276.98
a globe what the hell dude

7274.639 --> 7278.659000000001
do you even know what's coming out of

7276.98 --> 7281.178999999999
you

7278.659 --> 7286.119
it makes it what

7281.179 --> 7286.119
the [ __ ] are you blabbering about

7290.3 --> 7296.4400000000005
that

7291.56 --> 7296.4400000000005
like nothing about that makes sense

7306.32 --> 7309.94
like how can

7308.42 --> 7313.52
land

7309.94 --> 7316.5199999999995
lands that are presumably there not be

7313.52 --> 7316.52
accessible

7316.9 --> 7326.0599999999995
you're on a globe right how can lands

7320.96 --> 7329.02
not be accessible it makes no

7326.06 --> 7329.02
sense

7335.9 --> 7341.659
do you think we mapped every piece of

7338.659 --> 7344.659
land uh

7341.659 --> 7348.5599999999995
well that's what they've been telling us

7344.659 --> 7351.259999999999
for like the last hundred years so yeah

7348.56 --> 7353.96
don't you have satellites

7351.26 --> 7357.56
to cover every part

7353.96 --> 7358.96
huh how the hell can there even be any

7357.56 --> 7362.4800000000005
lands

7358.96 --> 7365.78
concealed or inaccessible if you're

7362.48 --> 7368.178999999999
living on a globe in this age with the

7365.78 --> 7371.48
age of satellites you can see everything

7368.179 --> 7374.5
how the [ __ ] can there be lamps that are

7371.48 --> 7377.718999999999
inaccessible to you on a globe it makes

7374.5 --> 7381.139
no sense

7377.719 --> 7383.86
let's just listen to yourself

7381.139 --> 7383.86
dude

7398.0 --> 7405.5
cheer on a globe a kumu

7401.96 --> 7410.7390000000005
how can it not all be mapped out

7405.5 --> 7413.96
you're living on a globe you dumb [ __ ]

7410.739 --> 7416.5599999999995
listen to yourself

7413.96 --> 7416.56
dude

7416.84 --> 7421.9400000000005
like

7418.219 --> 7424.219
what medication are you on and if you

7421.94 --> 7426.799999999999
aren't you might want to consider

7424.219 --> 7428.719
getting on some because what you're

7426.8 --> 7432.400000000001
saying is like

7428.719 --> 7434.2390000000005
kind of fully integrated

7432.4 --> 7437.179
psychosis

7434.239 --> 7442.598999999999
you don't seem to really have a grip on

7437.179 --> 7442.599
basic logic within thinking any longer

7444.139 --> 7448.659000000001
foreign

7445.28 --> 7448.659
just look it up

7452.119 --> 7459.32
I I can't deal with this

7455.0 --> 7462.079
like how can somebody be that insane

7459.32 --> 7464.54
like what is even the point of saying

7462.079 --> 7466.579
that it's not all mapped out if you're

7464.54 --> 7468.92
on a freaking Globe aren't you you

7466.579 --> 7471.0199999999995
numpty [ __ ]

7468.92 --> 7473.42
hello

7471.02 --> 7474.88
you think you live on a globe How can

7473.42 --> 7478.88
there be

7474.88 --> 7482.7390000000005
unmapped lands that makes no [ __ ]

7478.88 --> 7486.02
sense you numpty [ __ ]

7482.739 --> 7487.159
use your brain whatever the [ __ ] is left

7486.02 --> 7489.5
of that

7487.159 --> 7493.179
lump of protein

7489.5 --> 7493.179
Jesus Christ man

7497.78 --> 7500.99
[Music]

7501.139 --> 7507.0
it's just it's too much

7505.099 --> 7510.189
too much stupid

7507.0 --> 7510.189
[Music]

7510.5 --> 7514.3
stop doing this to yourself

7515.48 --> 7518.48
foreign

7521.5 --> 7524.92
[Music]

7535.88 --> 7539.079
Google it

7540.02 --> 7544.540000000001
that sounds hilarious seeking star water

7547.04 --> 7551.86
right I think I am gonna run out to show

7549.619 --> 7551.86
though

7552.98 --> 7556.659
it's quite dynamic

7575.719 --> 7580.34
Untouched by humans yeah but that's not

7577.94 --> 7584.079
where we're just because it's not touch

7580.34 --> 7584.079
doesn't mean it isn't mapped

7584.239 --> 7591.799999999999
I mean oh it hasn't been touched by men

7587.719 --> 7594.44
so nobody flew over it then

7591.8 --> 7595.6990000000005
with a plane

7594.44 --> 7599.0599999999995
or

7595.699 --> 7601.339999999999
your satellites

7599.06 --> 7604.820000000001
like

7601.34 --> 7607.28
dude like you seem to like seriously

7604.82 --> 7609.88
have cognition problems like this is not

7607.28 --> 7613.84
even funny anymore like this is actually

7609.88 --> 7613.84
legitimately concerning

7614.9 --> 7621.259999999999
like I am actually did you like have

7618.619 --> 7623.96
like an aneurysm or something because

7621.26 --> 7625.820000000001
like this is seriously scatterbrained

7623.96 --> 7630.56
this is bad akumu

7625.82 --> 7632.719
you should be able to realize what it is

7630.56 --> 7636.38
you're saying and logical consequences

7632.719 --> 7640.4
but you seem to just become

7636.38 --> 7643.219
it seems to just all pass you by

7640.4 --> 7647.0
and you have no objection

7643.219 --> 7647.0
that's psychosis

7649.579 --> 7656.96
that's actual palpable

7653.38 --> 7659.679
psychosis akumovirus this is not even

7656.96 --> 7659.679
funny anymore

7661.46 --> 7664.46
foreign

7675.38 --> 7683.4400000000005
yeah caves sure there's caves that's not

7678.82 --> 7683.44
maps of the surface though

7687.139 --> 7694.04
yeah but we weren't talking about caves

7689.659 --> 7695.839999999999
though yeah we're talking about lands

7694.04 --> 7698.56
you know

7695.84 --> 7703.88
land

7698.56 --> 7709.34
cave land cave land

7703.88 --> 7712.099
you said Lance unmapped lands

7709.34 --> 7715.88
not caves

7712.099 --> 7719.4400000000005
how can you have unmapped lands

7715.88 --> 7722.4400000000005
in an era where you have airplanes

7719.44 --> 7726.98
Zeppelins allegedly

7722.44 --> 7732.4
supposed satellites makes no sense what

7726.98 --> 7732.4
you said was just completely ape [ __ ]

7735.139 --> 7738.139
akumu

7746.96 --> 7753.04
the whole proofs this could be one you

7749.36 --> 7753.04
know in one of those caves

7753.099 --> 7756.88
uh yeah

7759.679 --> 7764.06
I think they can find their glow proof

7761.9 --> 7767.54
she's in Plato's Cave

7764.06 --> 7771.159000000001
just need to find Plato's Cave

7767.54 --> 7771.159
and everything will be all right

7771.8 --> 7777.679
they will

7773.54 --> 7780.199
learn once again it is a globe

7777.679 --> 7783.32
as long as they stay in Plato's Cave and

7780.199 --> 7786.0199999999995
just watch the the imagery the Shadow

7783.32 --> 7787.82
Blade television the globe is on there

7786.02 --> 7791.42
yeah yeah

7787.82 --> 7793.719
I can find proof of the globe in Plato's

7791.42 --> 7793.719
Cave

7795.86 --> 7800.679
trim it out what

7798.199 --> 7800.678999999999
thank you

7802.219 --> 7808.099
but if anyone's anybody wants to like

7804.739 --> 7810.32
trim out segments here or whatever

7808.099 --> 7812.179
it's it's going to be right here I yeah

7810.32 --> 7814.759999999999
if you want me to

7812.179 --> 7817.52
if you want to use part of my video as

7814.76 --> 7819.619000000001
an example of akumu or whatever what

7817.52 --> 7822.139
he's saying is on screen

7819.619 --> 7824.5
so yeah you can use that I give you

7822.139 --> 7824.5
permission

7830.49 --> 7833.599999999999
[Music]

7834.26 --> 7839.079000000001
if that's what you were talking about

7836.179 --> 7839.079
Tony Wickham

7849.85 --> 7852.929
[Music]

7864.8 --> 7870.02
takuma just doesn't seem to understand

7866.96 --> 7873.199
that a globe

7870.02 --> 7877.6990000000005
has very specific

7873.199 --> 7877.699
amount of surface

7878.84 --> 7884.599
things that are on there and that yeah

7881.84 --> 7887.119000000001
if you can ascend from that Globe like

7884.599 --> 7889.34
with an airplane or with

7887.119 --> 7892.659
suppose it's satellite

7889.34 --> 7896.0
and yeah guess what you can actually

7892.659 --> 7899.0599999999995
ensure that you cover it all

7896.0 --> 7901.76
so that you can map it doesn't have to

7899.06 --> 7903.56
be a detailed map but you can definitely

7901.76 --> 7905.96
establish like oh

7903.56 --> 7908.719
look there's the outline of this

7905.96 --> 7910.699
continent oh look there is the outline

7908.719 --> 7914.9
of that continent oh look it seems like

7910.699 --> 7920.0599999999995
there's volcanoes here in Sea right you

7914.9 --> 7923.679
get the map the map the complete map of

7920.06 --> 7923.679
the supposed globe

7926.84 --> 7936.9400000000005
yeah you said there were

7930.159 --> 7936.94
undiscovered lands on the globe even now

7937.04 --> 7943.3
that it wasn't mapped that's

7940.82 --> 7943.299999999999
she's

7944.179 --> 7949.6990000000005
that's just impossible

7947.239 --> 7953.0199999999995
if the Earth was a globe that's

7949.699 --> 7953.0199999999995
impossible at this point

7955.219 --> 7961.88
I know you're trying to like crawl your

7958.34 --> 7965.719
way back attractive or reinterpret that

7961.88 --> 7968.4800000000005
really dumb shitty thing that you said

7965.719 --> 7970.94
you've not already highlighted it to no

7968.48 --> 7973.459999999999
end yeah you can try to crawl your way

7970.94 --> 7976.46
back now and make it mean something else

7973.46 --> 7980.119
but it didn't you said it exactly the

7976.46 --> 7983.96
way you said it as I addressed it as I

7980.119 --> 7987.5599999999995
ask you to clarify it as I informed you

7983.96 --> 7991.36
about the incorrectness of your

7987.56 --> 7991.360000000001
assertion and you double down

7995.119 --> 8002.98
now you said unmapped

7998.599 --> 8002.9800000000005
Akuma virus unmapped

8003.639 --> 8008.1990000000005
not untouched and discovered it's all

8005.86 --> 8009.82
right there it's all visible it's all

8008.199 --> 8012.04
recorded whatever you even do with the

8009.82 --> 8014.679
chat afterwards it's all visibly there

8012.04 --> 8015.82
you can't double speak your way out of

8014.679 --> 8017.86
this

8015.82 --> 8020.98
if you would have said untouched or

8017.86 --> 8024.36
undiscovered I wouldn't even have had

8020.98 --> 8028.959999999999
any hook to make a logical

8024.36 --> 8032.88
inconsistently it inconsistency remark

8028.96 --> 8032.88
criticism about what you said

8034.659 --> 8042.48
yeah you didn't say untouched

8039.159 --> 8042.48
you said unmapped

8047.679 --> 8051.599
you copy and pasted that

8073.3 --> 8076.619000000001
did you know really

8078.639 --> 8081.42
thank you

8096.34 --> 8101.679
[ __ ] there's so much conversation here

8098.56 --> 8102.92
at least my chat's not sitting still

8101.679 --> 8106.119
[ __ ]

8102.92 --> 8106.119
[Music]

8111.3 --> 8117.46
yeah yeah let me copy

8114.699 --> 8119.82
when I originally responded to akumu

8117.46 --> 8119.82
virus

8123.55 --> 8126.609
[Music]

8134.02 --> 8139.719
here's it there are maps that aren't

8137.38 --> 8142.900000000001
able to be accessed

8139.719 --> 8144.4
yeah that's the statement that's the one

8142.9 --> 8146.759999999999
that did it

8144.4 --> 8149.98
not that thing that you copied

8146.76 --> 8152.88
apparently from somewhere else

8149.98 --> 8152.879999999999
this one

8153.159 --> 8158.379999999999
with timestamp that's what you said

8155.86 --> 8161.199
there are maps that aren't able to be

8158.38 --> 8164.619
accessed which is

8161.199 --> 8168.36
like extremely logically inconsistent if

8164.619 --> 8168.36
you actually believe the Earth is a glow

8175.84 --> 8179.8
that say undiscovered

8180.04 --> 8184.84
okay well no discovered apparently you

8182.8 --> 8188.5
did say

8184.84 --> 8190.84
aren't able to be accessed

8188.5 --> 8193.719
it's even worse dude it's worse than

8190.84 --> 8196.359
undiscovered so you can nitpick the [ __ ]

8193.719 --> 8198.88
out of oh this word that word this is

8196.359 --> 8201.54
what you said I copy pasted it it's

8198.88 --> 8201.539999999999
right there

8202.42 --> 8207.359
you can't double speak your way out of

8204.519 --> 8207.359
this one dude

8211.139 --> 8215.399
nasty oh my God

8217.84 --> 8220.84
ah

8229.439 --> 8237.399
yeah so so double down again then you

8233.8 --> 8241.24

8241.24 --> 8243.479
with

8250.79 --> 8258.949
[Music]

8261.88 --> 8267.279999999999
yeah now leave it seeking I don't want

8265.059 --> 8269.219
don't want that conversation to be

8267.28 --> 8272.139000000001
incomplete in chat

8269.219 --> 8274.899
but I am going to

8272.139 --> 8277.059
round up the show before I'm gonna get a

8274.899 --> 8281.92
headache from this numpty [ __ ]

8277.059 --> 8284.08

8293.62 --> 8298.42
things were discussed and yeah it was

8297.04 --> 8301.12
