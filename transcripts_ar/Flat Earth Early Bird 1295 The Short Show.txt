it's going to be only a half a show

84.32 --> 87.32
today

88.64 --> 91.92
weather

90.64 --> 94.56
is

91.92 --> 98.32000000000001
pretty decent but there have been trails

94.56 --> 100.0
actually i noticed this morning

98.32 --> 101.75899999999999
before i got up looking through the

100.0 --> 105.68
window

101.759 --> 108.159
there were trails being left and it is

105.68 --> 108.159
i don't know

108.24 --> 112.72
you could see them hanging in between or

110.64 --> 114.399
above

112.72 --> 117.439
regular clouds

114.399 --> 120.0
but despite despite that there's still

117.439 --> 120.0
some blue

120.479 --> 128.68
and it's very warm

124.0 --> 128.68
very nice summer day despite the trails

131.44 --> 136.239
last i checked it was 22 degrees celsius

139.84 --> 145.92000000000002
hello len lenox first in chat la young

143.68 --> 151.8
good to see you

145.92 --> 151.79999999999998
it is wednesday the 6th of july 2022

159.04 --> 162.959
and yeah i'm a little tense today it's

161.599 --> 165.44
just

162.959 --> 168.4
a lot of information considering the

165.44 --> 170.48
dutch protest from the farmers

168.4 --> 171.92000000000002
it's been going all over the place

170.48 --> 173.84
people are picking up on it owen

171.92 --> 174.95899999999997
benjamin made an item out of it again

173.84 --> 176.879
yesterday

174.959 --> 178.879
really funny because he was worried

176.879 --> 182.79999999999998
about the dutch

178.879 --> 186.0
slagger song and then polo nasa dancing

182.8 --> 188.0
which is like very typically dutch

186.0 --> 190.959
but yeah

188.0 --> 192.56
i i understood his point i always

190.959 --> 195.04
thought it was kind of gay as well but

192.56 --> 198.8
it's just really dutch

195.04 --> 201.12
and definitely preceded any

198.8 --> 204.64000000000001
gayification

201.12 --> 204.64000000000001
that all came afterward

206.239 --> 209.36
but yeah

208.48 --> 211.44
some

209.36 --> 213.84
farmer

211.44 --> 215.76
like 16 year old guy in his tractor

213.84 --> 218.56
apparently got shot at with live

215.76 --> 221.2
ammunition from police which is just

218.56 --> 224.08
completely outrageous

221.2 --> 226.72
because he was literally just driving

224.08 --> 230.48000000000002
by on some road

226.72 --> 233.439
out in the country it completely absurd

230.48 --> 236.879
so i'm a little like a

233.439 --> 236.879
little agitated i guess

239.439 --> 243.2
but other than that i'm doing pretty

240.959 --> 243.20000000000002
good

245.92 --> 250.23899999999998
a bit tense though

248.08 --> 252.64000000000001
i was almost just not gonna do a show

250.239 --> 252.64000000000001
today

253.68 --> 257.28000000000003
now i'm doing half down i'm doing half a

256.079 --> 258.88
show

257.28 --> 262.11999999999995
all right hello mike sedenich good to

258.88 --> 262.12
see you

276.56 --> 283.04
but just can you believe it guys

278.96 --> 284.32
a 16 year old that is like working

283.04 --> 286.56
crushing it

284.32 --> 290.0
as a tractor

286.56 --> 292.0
probably paid for it himself

290.0 --> 294.56
i mean that's a thing among farmer

292.0 --> 297.44
culture here

294.56 --> 301.199
and then he gets shot at with live

297.44 --> 301.199
ammunition from police

301.52 --> 306.44
i mean that is just unbelievable

310.24 --> 315.36
and the media the mainstream media like

313.52 --> 318.88
everybody's taking note of is not

315.36 --> 318.88
covering it at all

320.56 --> 326.639
they're they're covering almost nothing

322.56 --> 326.639
they're all keeping very silent about it

334.96 --> 339.63899999999995
close flatter sage good to see you

347.6 --> 352.56
right so here is the article question it

350.639 --> 353.68
even reached info wars well of course it

352.56 --> 356.56
died

353.68 --> 357.68
which usually reaches those things

356.56 --> 360.0
but uh

357.68 --> 360.0
yeah

364.8 --> 369.36
watching a little bit of yesterday's

366.24 --> 370.08
show early bird show you mean

369.36 --> 372.319
yeah

370.08 --> 373.52
dude i it was interesting it was very

372.319 --> 375.44
rowdy

373.52 --> 380.35999999999996
of course

375.44 --> 380.36
got a lot of mandela squirting happening

380.72 --> 388.16
but yeah i did actually just out pull

384.16 --> 388.16
out of my magical irwin hat

388.479 --> 391.919
that

389.36 --> 393.039
that keef stone

391.919 --> 395.84
inside

393.039 --> 398.0
about oh maybe the corrupt the corrupted

395.84 --> 400.08
are the ones that are men appear to be

398.0 --> 401.12
mandela changing whatever that is

400.08 --> 403.68
whether it's

401.12 --> 405.199
it is probably all psychological

403.68 --> 407.919
versus

405.199 --> 410.479
the uncorrupted things and yeah that's

407.919 --> 413.039
not because you think it's uncorrupted

410.479 --> 414.88
it's corrupted or it isn't now how you

413.039 --> 416.71999999999997
think about that is a whole different

414.88 --> 418.479
thing

416.72 --> 421.36
based on your reflections your

418.479 --> 421.35999999999996
interpretations

421.68 --> 428.72
but i really think i caught on

424.8 --> 431.44
to this little trixie this insight

428.72 --> 434.639
clearing up the map what's happening

431.44 --> 434.639
in a certain way

435.44 --> 439.599
i don't think i've ever heard a single

437.52 --> 442.08
mandela effect believer that makes all

439.599 --> 444.479
these videos actually

442.08 --> 444.479
reveal

446.72 --> 449.72
right

450.08 --> 454.31899999999996
anyway i don't really want to talk about

451.759 --> 454.319
that today

455.919 --> 460.44
but yeah it was a good enough show

457.44 --> 460.44
yesterday

471.12 --> 477.52
i will absolutely eventually unban rest

474.319 --> 480.08000000000004
ahead but i know it is probably still

477.52 --> 482.08
annoyed and

480.08 --> 485.12
squirting

482.08 --> 487.84
over it because he's just really deeply

485.12 --> 489.68
into mandela i noticed this like a a

487.84 --> 491.28
month or two ago

489.68 --> 493.199
weird

491.28 --> 495.039
i tried to warn him like dude why are

493.199 --> 495.759
you so into this

495.039 --> 498.639
it's

495.759 --> 498.639
not good man

499.57 --> 502.769
[Music]

504.08 --> 507.84
okay

505.199 --> 507.84000000000003
i didn't know that

514.56 --> 519.5189999999999
right by the way i've had no feedback

516.64 --> 522.3199999999999
whatsoever on my specific mandela

519.519 --> 522.32
experience with

522.8 --> 525.4399999999999
akira

526.88 --> 534.24
i asked adam meekin about it he he says

529.76 --> 539.12
that he has seen it when he was like 17.

534.24 --> 539.12
so i'm yeah that he hasn't actually

539.36 --> 545.6800000000001
gotten back to me about it so maybe

542.32 --> 547.6
that's just my personal weird aberration

545.68 --> 549.1999999999999
of where i was at with my mind in the

547.6 --> 551.76
time i mean

549.2 --> 554.88
it was freaking when i was 17 that's in

551.76 --> 556.64
the exact time frame where i had my big

554.88 --> 560.0
vision

556.64 --> 562.88
of the pattern and also my deepest dark

560.0 --> 566.0
world experience

562.88 --> 566.0
well all of that

566.24 --> 568.72
heightened

568.88 --> 572.959
surrealness that was probably in me

571.04 --> 575.12
might have contributed might have like

572.959 --> 578.16
altered just the way the material

575.12 --> 579.92
arrived to me right this is like

578.16 --> 583.4399999999999
deeper mandela

579.92 --> 586.0799999999999
still psychological though

583.44 --> 587.6800000000001
i still don't know i gotta find people

586.08 --> 591.44
that have

587.68 --> 594.0
had the same experience or it's just

591.44 --> 595.12
gonna be a little old me that remembers

594.0 --> 597.279
it like that

595.12 --> 599.92
oh no dude i have

597.279 --> 602.8
i did watch it even with like

599.92 --> 606.64
a friend that i knew back then

602.8 --> 606.64
not like the jesuit guy or anything

607.6 --> 612.88
i wonder like

609.68 --> 615.279
they should remember it too

612.88 --> 616.8389999999999
but yeah i don't even know like what

615.279 --> 619.68
he's still

616.839 --> 622.6400000000001
around i've spoken him in

619.68 --> 622.64
15 years

631.68 --> 635.68
i re-recorded the

633.68 --> 639.92
japanese audio

635.68 --> 639.92
no but it doesn't seem like it terminoid

641.519 --> 647.48
i've noticed they like rearranged the

643.839 --> 647.48
music a little

648.64 --> 650.88
but

649.76 --> 653.279
no

650.88 --> 655.4399999999999
like every other part pretty much of the

653.279 --> 656.88
entire movie all the audios and i've

655.44 --> 658.72
heard them a lot

656.88 --> 660.8
many many times

658.72 --> 662.64
they all seemed exactly as they were

660.8 --> 664.959
supposed to be

662.64 --> 666.56
it's just that combat cry that seems

664.959 --> 668.0
like out of place there's something

666.56 --> 670.64
missing

668.0 --> 672.399
that's all real it's all i i bumped into

670.64 --> 673.92
other than like hey the music is

672.399 --> 675.36
different that's not good i don't like

673.92 --> 677.68
this version

675.36 --> 680.72
but then i got my old dvd

677.68 --> 681.92
and it had the original music the way it

680.72 --> 683.12
was

681.92 --> 686.12
so

683.12 --> 686.12
yeah

689.36 --> 692.92
lost in translation

704.0 --> 708.56
right okay so flatter sage

706.8 --> 712.399
weird that you missed it because i did

708.56 --> 715.1999999999999
lay it down very in detail

712.399 --> 718.16
my specific memory

715.2 --> 719.36
from akira that seems to be just missing

718.16 --> 720.48
now

719.36 --> 723.36
is

720.48 --> 725.519
pretty much at the start of the movie

723.36 --> 727.2
i even have the time slot

725.519 --> 730.16
if you want to look that up on netflix

727.2 --> 732.639
it pretty much exactly around 12 minutes

730.16 --> 734.8
35 seconds

732.639 --> 737.2
and at the end of the

734.8 --> 739.76
the motorcycle chase scene

737.2 --> 741.2
that sewell

739.76 --> 744.3199999999999
moves up

741.2 --> 746.399
to like a clown

744.32 --> 749.36
like a clown gang member that just fell

746.399 --> 751.68
off his bike and he basically bashes his

749.36 --> 754.32
head off on his bike speeding at him

751.68 --> 756.7199999999999
with a wrench it's super brutal

754.32 --> 761.44
but he makes a combat scream when he

756.72 --> 763.76
does that and in my memory it's

761.44 --> 765.9200000000001
something like that it's very hard to

763.76 --> 768.24
emulate because it's like a japanese

765.92 --> 769.68
trick almost what he did and i was very

768.24 --> 771.2
impressed by it like oh that's so

769.68 --> 774.56
japanese

771.2 --> 774.5600000000001
never heard it anywhere else

775.36 --> 778.72
but he just goes ah

778.8 --> 782.959
and that's it

781.2 --> 785.76
like he does pretty much throughout the

782.959 --> 788.7199999999999
entire movie and whenever he basically

785.76 --> 789.8389999999999
smashes somebody with his powers

788.72 --> 791.12
right

789.839 --> 793.9200000000001
so

791.12 --> 796.88
that was the

793.92 --> 798.079
seeming mandela like effect

796.88 --> 800.88
for me

798.079 --> 803.12
when i watched it back

800.88 --> 805.8389999999999
by the way the the music in that movie

803.12 --> 809.36
is freaking amazing man

805.839 --> 812.5600000000001
especially the scary parts

809.36 --> 812.5600000000001
because it is so

812.959 --> 816.4799999999999
expressive of like

818.72 --> 823.6
like some of those dark [ __ ] that tatsu

821.68 --> 826.399
goes through like the hallucinations and

823.6 --> 829.6
all that and like

826.399 --> 830.72
the sounds the music that like doom

829.6 --> 832.48
comes up

830.72 --> 835.279
and all that like

832.48 --> 839.519
i've had in my dark world

835.279 --> 841.8389999999999
experiences like it is almost like that

839.519 --> 844.079
like if the darkness comes by in the

841.839 --> 845.519
dark world that's like exactly what it

844.079 --> 848.3199999999999
feels like

845.519 --> 849.76
it is so freaking scary but it's also

848.32 --> 851.44
like

849.76 --> 853.76
an illusion

851.44 --> 856.72
weak and like tatsu does like kind of

853.76 --> 859.6
find that out in ways

856.72 --> 861.839
it's so fascinating the way the entire

859.6 --> 864.32
thing builds up it is like pretty much

861.839 --> 865.6800000000001
one of the most epic stories i've ever

864.32 --> 868.5600000000001
seen

865.68 --> 868.56
so extreme

868.72 --> 873.6
like it is

870.48 --> 873.6
it's almost like a

876.32 --> 879.6
i've been thinking about it like it

880.24 --> 883.6
could you call this it's like a rot it's

882.639 --> 885.6800000000001
like they're

883.6 --> 888.399
from an atheist perspective they're

885.68 --> 891.04
trying to figure out the actual original

888.399 --> 892.639
rise to little g godhood and they're

891.04 --> 894.639
trying to like

892.639 --> 897.12
calculate how it works that's that

894.639 --> 899.6800000000001
freaking professor doing you know he's

897.12 --> 902.079
like literally messing with this with

899.68 --> 904.56
like awakening a god

902.079 --> 906.88
and thinks that he can like mechanize it

904.56 --> 908.88
somehow totally insane and he dies for

906.88 --> 910.24
it of course in the movie in the end

908.88 --> 912.88
like most

910.24 --> 916.399
people in there

912.88 --> 918.88
but like the way the music approaches

916.399 --> 920.16
everything about that and akira and just

918.88 --> 922.16
the sound

920.16 --> 925.279
like they do really shine that through

922.16 --> 929.8389999999999
like akira was almost like a return of

925.279 --> 932.24
christ like the formula it just that

929.839 --> 934.8000000000001
it didn't make sense like god doesn't

932.24 --> 937.44
actually allowed it so it just turned

934.8 --> 939.7589999999999
into this giant energy consuming

937.44 --> 943.12
explosion implosion thing

939.759 --> 945.44
it's that's how i feel about it

943.12 --> 947.839
like these freaking

945.44 --> 950.0
japanese scientists were trying to

947.839 --> 952.5600000000001
experiment like with

950.0 --> 954.959
awakening a god

952.56 --> 957.5999999999999
from the old days like things that are

954.959 --> 958.56
highly occulted very dark but they were

957.6 --> 960.8000000000001
just

958.56 --> 963.199
amorally trying to experiment with it

960.8 --> 965.92
totally insane

963.199 --> 968.4799999999999
and that's like that came out of it and

965.92 --> 971.4399999999999
the makers of the movie like really took

968.48 --> 971.44
that serious

973.36 --> 978.24
so no wonder like

976.0 --> 980.32
in a way i did feel this even when i was

978.24 --> 982.9590000000001
young so no wonder that i like watched

980.32 --> 985.1990000000001
it like seven times in a row

982.959 --> 987.8389999999999
because it was so

985.199 --> 987.8389999999999
impressive

991.839 --> 996.0
yeah and when the the first dude if

993.759 --> 998.639
you've never seen it and the first time

996.0 --> 998.639
you watch it

998.72 --> 1003.6
it's very unlikely you understand

1001.12 --> 1005.36
anything more than one third

1003.6 --> 1008.16
of what the hell is going on in there

1005.36 --> 1010.88
because so much detail

1008.16 --> 1014.079
and not like techno babble filler detail

1010.88 --> 1016.88
but just subtle details so much subtle

1014.079 --> 1019.199
detail it is surreal

1016.88 --> 1019.199
and

1020.959 --> 1026.0
yeah you you gotta watch it like at

1023.44 --> 1029.439
least three times before you really get

1026.0 --> 1029.439
a grasp of what it is

1030.0 --> 1035.52
to start getting that grass anyway

1033.28 --> 1037.6
i haven't watched it in another time

1035.52 --> 1041.4
it's just still like the music is still

1037.6 --> 1041.3999999999999
echoing in my head

1045.14 --> 1048.279
[Music]

1054.16 --> 1058.96
especially when they go

1055.95 --> 1062.679
[Music]

1058.96 --> 1062.679
oh so scary

1068.08 --> 1070.799
brilliant

1069.28 --> 1073.6789999999999
what a soundscape

1070.799 --> 1075.76
it is something else

1073.679 --> 1078.8400000000001
right hey adamikin

1075.76 --> 1081.28
i thought it was in japanese with

1078.84 --> 1082.72
subtit never even watched the english

1081.28 --> 1084.8799999999999
version

1082.72 --> 1087.6000000000001
i do japanese with dutch subtitles

1084.88 --> 1088.5590000000002
that's how i'm used to watching it

1087.6 --> 1090.799
although

1088.559 --> 1093.12
the subtitles are always different

1090.799 --> 1095.84
because there's like i think i would

1093.12 --> 1098.6399999999999
like to really speak to an actual

1095.84 --> 1101.52
japanese lingua expert because i think

1098.64 --> 1103.919
there's like a couple of things in the

1101.52 --> 1106.48
movie that are kind of fuzzy as to what

1103.919 --> 1108.24
they're actually saying in japanese and

1106.48 --> 1110.559
that's

1108.24 --> 1112.88
why sometimes it's like

1110.559 --> 1114.24
they don't really they're trying to

1112.88 --> 1116.16
interpret it

1114.24 --> 1117.76
make it making sense in the story

1116.16 --> 1119.28
instead of actually getting what they're

1117.76 --> 1121.2
saying

1119.28 --> 1123.9189999999999
it's like this weird little language

1121.2 --> 1125.52
flukes in the japanese version in there

1123.919 --> 1128.72
like always have been

1125.52 --> 1130.6399999999999
this is yeah it's such a weird movie so

1128.72 --> 1132.08
interesting

1130.64 --> 1133.76
anyway

1132.08 --> 1135.52
yeah so i was reflecting some more on

1133.76 --> 1137.84
that

1135.52 --> 1137.84
and

1141.2 --> 1146.16
okay linux

1143.28 --> 1146.16
yeah yesterday

1146.96 --> 1152.4
i kind of bypassed on

1149.52 --> 1154.32
qe live i was chat skanking i call it

1152.4 --> 1156.48
just chat skanky now it's what i do

1154.32 --> 1157.4399999999998
because i do like to absolutely poke

1156.48 --> 1158.32
them

1157.44 --> 1160.559
so

1158.32 --> 1162.559
this new tradition

1160.559 --> 1164.559
when you when there's kiwi live i do

1162.559 --> 1165.76
chat skanking i'm going to be that guy

1164.559 --> 1169.6
in the chat

1165.76 --> 1169.6
basically make fun of everything in poke

1171.44 --> 1177.799
i love doing it

1173.12 --> 1177.799
but i can only do it from the chat

1178.799 --> 1182.4
but yeah um

1180.4 --> 1183.3600000000001
then i went on

1182.4 --> 1185.2
uh

1183.36 --> 1186.7199999999998
made by jim bobs

1185.2 --> 1188.16
don't know if anybody's

1186.72 --> 1189.76
has seen that

1188.16 --> 1192.0
i went on

1189.76 --> 1194.4
with some other guy don't remember and

1192.0 --> 1194.4
posh

1195.52 --> 1199.52
because yeah the subject was

1197.84 --> 1201.84
veganism and

1199.52 --> 1203.52
i brought up some points

1201.84 --> 1207.12
like

1203.52 --> 1210.24
hashtag vegans against klaus like why

1207.12 --> 1211.84
aren't vegans very concerned that

1210.24 --> 1213.919
all this attack

1211.84 --> 1217.36
of farmers and all that

1213.919 --> 1220.7990000000002
with the wef agenda in the long run why

1217.36 --> 1223.6789999999999
aren't they like working with us because

1220.799 --> 1226.0
yeah if close let's just call it klaus

1223.679 --> 1227.76
club schwab wins

1226.0 --> 1229.84
you're going to be forced to eat bugs

1227.76 --> 1232.8799999999999
too vegans

1229.84 --> 1235.6
bugs are not vegan

1232.88 --> 1238.7990000000002
so i made that point

1235.6 --> 1241.36
and some other points too

1238.799 --> 1243.84
so yeah yesterday i was overall pretty

1241.36 --> 1243.84
active

1244.72 --> 1251.52
my own show flatters debate and later

1248.4 --> 1254.3200000000002
on made by jim bob so check that out

1251.52 --> 1254.32
it's hilarious

1258.0 --> 1263.0
i also mimicked posh's voice

1270.72 --> 1275.64
right and it forces them and there are

1272.4 --> 1275.64
some honest

1276.72 --> 1279.6000000000001
so

1277.76 --> 1282.919
that's made by jimbo upstream where i

1279.6 --> 1282.9189999999999
was on yesterday

1302.96 --> 1306.96
mannequins what are you talking about

1308.159 --> 1311.3600000000001
aurora

1309.6 --> 1314.24
oh

1311.36 --> 1314.24
yeah it could be

1316.72 --> 1319.72
edo

1319.919 --> 1327.5590000000002
yeah it could be aura or aura

1322.559 --> 1327.559
but aura could be it is that a thing

1334.559 --> 1340.6
are you japanese by any chance your name

1336.799 --> 1340.6
does sound very japanese

1346.799 --> 1349.2
okay

1356.88 --> 1360.64
you heard the dutch farmers have

1358.32 --> 1362.32
purchased a tank i've heard something

1360.64 --> 1364.0800000000002
like that too i don't know what to think

1362.32 --> 1367.3999999999999
of that yet

1364.08 --> 1367.3999999999999
it's weird

1375.919 --> 1379.76
in a way i think it's kind of cool

1377.44 --> 1379.76
actually

1382.32 --> 1386.96
dutch farmers at war with police now

1384.72 --> 1389.76
well

1386.96 --> 1390.96
it kind of seems like it

1389.76 --> 1393.36
i mean

1390.96 --> 1395.8400000000001
police have literally been shooting with

1393.36 --> 1398.24
live ammunition

1395.84 --> 1400.0
at like 16 year old farmers that were

1398.24 --> 1402.08
just driving

1400.0 --> 1403.36
in their tractor on the road doing

1402.08 --> 1406.07
nothing

1403.36 --> 1409.12
but just driving on the road really sick

1406.07 --> 1411.36
[Music]

1409.12 --> 1411.36
so

1412.799 --> 1415.039
yeah

1415.679 --> 1421.1200000000001
i'm a little uh

1417.919 --> 1421.1200000000001
riled up right now

1422.96 --> 1427.279
i'm really rooting for these guys

1426.0 --> 1429.2
farmers

1427.279 --> 1431.6
they're such crushes man they're like

1429.2 --> 1434.88
seriously they're so young and so eager

1431.6 --> 1437.279
so spirited i love them

1434.88 --> 1439.0390000000002
as in in the way i look up to them even

1437.279 --> 1442.0
though they're younger than me on

1439.039 --> 1442.0
average probably

1442.64 --> 1445.8400000000001
and in a way i

1446.0 --> 1451.679
many times wish that i was i would have

1448.88 --> 1454.3200000000002
been wiser at a young age and actually

1451.679 --> 1456.48
gone out and become a farmer i wish i

1454.32 --> 1458.0
had

1456.48 --> 1460.96
i don't know if i would have had it in

1458.0 --> 1463.6
me truly though

1460.96 --> 1463.6000000000001
but still

1464.32 --> 1468.24
in retrospect that would have been a

1465.919 --> 1470.5590000000002
great choice

1468.24 --> 1472.559
and it had actually been recommended to

1470.559 --> 1474.6399999999999
me i was just like ugh but i don't want

1472.559 --> 1479.12
to like

1474.64 --> 1479.1200000000001
be smelling like cow pool then

1479.2 --> 1485.3600000000001
right that's how i was just ew no

1483.039 --> 1487.679
but i should have just

1485.36 --> 1489.6789999999999
actually tried it

1487.679 --> 1492.159
i mean i didn't really end up trying

1489.679 --> 1494.24
anything else well i tried like a bit of

1492.159 --> 1496.3200000000002
media i wanted to make computer games

1494.24 --> 1497.6
that completely

1496.32 --> 1499.84
broke

1497.6 --> 1501.52
i was just rejected and

1499.84 --> 1504.0
then i really didn't know what to do

1501.52 --> 1504.0
anymore

1505.679 --> 1510.799
and then i just like became a conspiracy

1508.08 --> 1513.84
theorist watch alex jones and then learn

1510.799 --> 1516.559
a [ __ ] ton of things including an entire

1513.84 --> 1518.799
alternative medical approach

1516.559 --> 1520.6399999999999
and just learned so much because of all

1518.799 --> 1522.1589999999999
that

1520.64 --> 1523.8400000000001
right

1522.159 --> 1525.7600000000002
so it's not like i ended up with

1523.84 --> 1528.8799999999999
entirely nothing i mean

1525.76 --> 1532.799
yeah i'm an oracle now but still

1528.88 --> 1532.7990000000002
i still kind of look up to farmers

1537.76 --> 1543.84
never too late the farmers i was looking

1539.919 --> 1543.8400000000001
for yeah i've been thinking about that

1557.76 --> 1560.1589999999999
right

1563.039 --> 1568.0
it's just that me personally i've always

1565.279 --> 1570.48
been much more of a garden guy

1568.0 --> 1573.44
like not too much you know

1570.48 --> 1575.52
like i'm not like oh yeah just

1573.44 --> 1578.559
why take it small when you can do it

1575.52 --> 1580.96
like a real farmer and just like have

1578.559 --> 1583.279
multiple hectares

1580.96 --> 1585.76
like giant amounts of land with all

1583.279 --> 1588.559
kinds of stuff and just do it

1585.76 --> 1592.24
and i just i get dazzled from that i'm

1588.559 --> 1592.24
like no a garden is like

1594.08 --> 1596.559
yeah like

1595.6 --> 1598.7199999999998
the

1596.559 --> 1601.6
if it would be as big as this grass

1598.72 --> 1603.919
field down here i'd be like wow that's a

1601.6 --> 1605.6789999999999
big garden man i could spend like so

1603.919 --> 1608.0800000000002
much time improve so much in that i

1605.679 --> 1609.8400000000001
could spend half a lifetime on that

1608.08 --> 1611.84
that's like big to me

1609.84 --> 1615.039
like i don't need giant amounts of land

1611.84 --> 1615.039
really i'm much more of a

1615.52 --> 1619.76
i would just like to

1617.12 --> 1621.76
like get fruit trees and all kinds like

1619.76 --> 1622.72
a variety of stuff

1621.76 --> 1624.4
it's in

1622.72 --> 1626.08
because why

1624.4 --> 1626.96
because that's kind of what my mother

1626.08 --> 1629.52
did

1626.96 --> 1632.24
in my old house

1629.52 --> 1634.799
we had like an amazing

1632.24 --> 1639.039
vegetable but mostly fruit garden with

1634.799 --> 1640.559
like unbelievable different amounts

1639.039 --> 1643.12
of fruits

1640.559 --> 1644.48
it's just a relatively small garden

1643.12 --> 1648.0
and it was great it was a little

1644.48 --> 1648.0
paradise i really miss it

1651.919 --> 1655.5200000000002
so

1653.36 --> 1657.76
i'm more of a gardener than a farmer i

1655.52 --> 1657.76
think

1658.24 --> 1664.559
also i really like to make like gardens

1661.52 --> 1664.559
beautiful and all that

1666.159 --> 1670.0800000000002
i've always been more focused at

1667.76 --> 1672.0
aesthetics really

1670.08 --> 1673.84
and that's not a really good trait for a

1672.0 --> 1676.08
farmer because a farmer is just like

1673.84 --> 1678.1589999999999
nope just don't think don't spend all

1676.08 --> 1680.1589999999999
that time on thinking about you do it

1678.159 --> 1682.24
according to the system and pay

1680.159 --> 1684.3200000000002
attention and just keep going because

1682.24 --> 1686.96
there's so much to do

1684.32 --> 1688.72
as a real farmer it just doesn't fit

1686.96 --> 1691.44
with me in a way

1688.72 --> 1695.0
but i highly respect it though

1691.44 --> 1695.0
those that do

1705.44 --> 1710.24
but yeah

1706.72 --> 1713.52
like working on a farm for like a period

1710.24 --> 1713.52
that could be interesting

1719.44 --> 1725.8400000000001
hey slow moment buggy

1722.64 --> 1725.8400000000001
raise by gypsies

1729.919 --> 1734.0
but yeah in a way i'm kind of

1731.279 --> 1736.24
exhilarated that despite the entire

1734.0 --> 1738.08
media blackout that personally i hadn't

1736.24 --> 1739.1200000000001
even taken notice off because i don't

1738.08 --> 1741.52
watch

1739.12 --> 1744.0
that's media at all

1741.52 --> 1744.0
at all

1744.32 --> 1747.2
it's so annoying to me i don't even

1745.919 --> 1748.5590000000002
watch it so i hadn't noticed that

1747.2 --> 1750.24
nothing is on there i still watch

1748.559 --> 1752.6399999999999
alternative stuff and like there's

1750.24 --> 1754.24
plenty of articles and reminders of

1752.64 --> 1756.88
what's going on with the farmers and the

1754.24 --> 1759.44
protests and all that for a while

1756.88 --> 1762.48
but now like there's a lot of attention

1759.44 --> 1766.8400000000001
internationally for what's happening

1762.48 --> 1766.84
and i'm really happy about that

1767.76 --> 1772.08
because yeah they deserve

1769.76 --> 1774.48
that attention i mean they're really

1772.08 --> 1776.32
like a resistance force right now

1774.48 --> 1778.96
our farmers

1776.32 --> 1780.8799999999999
and it's a battle between life and death

1778.96 --> 1782.96
i mean this is the future of our country

1780.88 --> 1786.3200000000002
that's in the balance right here

1782.96 --> 1788.24
this is really serious and they know it

1786.32 --> 1791.12
and i think a lot of the

1788.24 --> 1795.3990000000001
the more general dutch public is also

1791.12 --> 1795.399
starting to catch on to that

1799.039 --> 1803.919
you heard of gorilla gardening gorilla

1801.44 --> 1803.919
gardening

1806.88 --> 1812.3200000000002
do just that that's cool

1809.279 --> 1816.24
yeah i do that part is why there's

1812.32 --> 1816.24
all kinds of developments with

1816.64 --> 1820.24
gardening and

1819.039 --> 1824.48
farming

1820.24 --> 1826.3990000000001
all over the place soil management

1824.48 --> 1829.1200000000001
like vertical

1826.399 --> 1829.12
farming and

1831.84 --> 1835.36
so hydroponics

1834.0 --> 1837.2
there's so much

1835.36 --> 1840.4799999999998
and it's been out there for like two

1837.2 --> 1843.1200000000001
decades of development right

1840.48 --> 1845.6
there's like veteran status developments

1843.12 --> 1847.6
in all these fields by now

1845.6 --> 1851.84
it's out there and it's available

1847.6 --> 1851.84
through video if you know where to dig

1861.12 --> 1865.039
okay

1862.84 --> 1867.279
fiona broome

1865.039 --> 1869.76
okey dokey

1867.279 --> 1869.76
yes

1871.279 --> 1874.519
that's hilarious

1879.79 --> 1882.859
[Music]

1890.32 --> 1898.08
yeah matthew hall yeah and by the way

1893.919 --> 1901.2
it it's not just our farmers by the way

1898.08 --> 1903.519
it's also fishermen

1901.2 --> 1905.279
i've started to kind of like well i've

1903.519 --> 1908.08
even like there was already signs of

1905.279 --> 1910.64
that but it's becoming like a

1908.08 --> 1914.24
a much wider movement even

1910.64 --> 1914.24
like all our local

1914.48 --> 1917.6
food producers

1919.44 --> 1925.559
they're all getting it and they're all

1921.519 --> 1925.559
like getting together

1955.6 --> 1960.08
the independent farmer really needs the

1957.919 --> 1963.0800000000002
prayers

1960.08 --> 1963.08
yes

1966.0 --> 1968.559
i agree

1969.279 --> 1976.88
like farmer does need to be able to be

1972.96 --> 1978.3990000000001
to retain or to remain an independent

1976.88 --> 1980.5590000000002
profession

1978.399 --> 1983.4399999999998
where you can just be that

1980.559 --> 1985.84
and get around right they have to be

1983.44 --> 1988.0800000000002
able to at least get around that that

1985.84 --> 1988.08
should

1989.279 --> 1994.24
be a priority in my

1991.519 --> 1996.559
long-term opinion about it

1994.24 --> 1998.72
but yeah there is going to be just like

1996.559 --> 2000.72
really ambitious farmers too that are

1998.72 --> 2003.039
like gonna really try to upgrade the

2000.72 --> 2003.039
game

2003.279 --> 2007.6
they should not be stopped really they

2006.159 --> 2010.24
should be like

2007.6 --> 2012.0
keep an eye capped on right aren't they

2010.24 --> 2015.76
like pushing

2012.0 --> 2016.64
pushing it a little in certain fronts

2015.76 --> 2020.0
right

2016.64 --> 2020.88
because ambition can be very tricky

2020.0 --> 2022.48
but

2020.88 --> 2024.72
yeah a lot of

2022.48 --> 2026.3990000000001
good developments have also come out of

2024.72 --> 2027.6000000000001
that

2026.399 --> 2029.76
right

2027.6 --> 2032.6399999999999
as long as those

2029.76 --> 2035.24
corporate farmers as you call it are not

2032.64 --> 2038.64
a part of this freaking

2035.24 --> 2040.3990000000001
modernizing wef movement

2038.64 --> 2042.72
right

2040.399 --> 2044.4799999999998
part of the like oh yeah yeah oh we're

2042.72 --> 2047.76
we got all this but in the end we're

2044.48 --> 2049.839
just gonna like kneel before klaus and

2047.76 --> 2052.639
make you all eat bugs

2049.839 --> 2053.44
right because that's something that's

2052.639 --> 2056.159
just

2053.44 --> 2056.159
unacceptable

2058.639 --> 2064.8
they're not gonna force us to eat soy

2060.96 --> 2064.8
they're not gonna make us eat bugs

2073.52 --> 2075.839
right

2102.72 --> 2108.0789999999997
have the best flowers in the well there

2104.64 --> 2108.0789999999997
is that yeah there is some

2108.48 --> 2114.56
flower industry as well traditionally

2110.72 --> 2116.56
for a very long time very big scale

2114.56 --> 2119.359
although they're always they always have

2116.56 --> 2121.92
been very dependent on like

2119.359 --> 2121.92
export

2123.119 --> 2125.359
like

2125.52 --> 2132.24
like big shipping

2128.48 --> 2136.0
and all that so those flower markets are

2132.24 --> 2136.0
really in more international

2139.44 --> 2147.2000000000003
90 of food already uses soy no

2144.16 --> 2150.44
well not the food that i've been eating

2147.2 --> 2150.4399999999996
then white

2165.68 --> 2172.24
but yeah i eat organic and i avoid soy

2168.88 --> 2175.28
and because there is like soy in or in

2172.24 --> 2178.16
organic food shops and all that as well

2175.28 --> 2178.1600000000003
i avoid that

2185.76 --> 2189.2000000000003
yeah raised by gypsy well

2187.839 --> 2192.96
gmo

2189.2 --> 2192.96
is illegal in the netherlands

2193.599 --> 2196.079
like that

2196.56 --> 2202.7999999999997
i was there man i was there like with

2198.96 --> 2207.2
the final protest like like monsanto

2202.8 --> 2209.44
bayer like you are not allowed to

2207.2 --> 2211.7599999999998
operate here

2209.44 --> 2211.76
ever

2212.079 --> 2215.8390000000004
no gmo in the netherlands

2226.24 --> 2230.72
okay well ben white that's interesting

2228.4 --> 2234.1600000000003
that you say that it replaced everything

2230.72 --> 2236.3999999999996
i'm not noticing that at all

2234.16 --> 2236.3999999999996
so

2238.0 --> 2243.839
maybe where you're living at but not

2240.4 --> 2243.839
where i'm at

2259.92 --> 2262.88
huh

2261.119 --> 2266.2400000000002
what are your sauce man

2262.88 --> 2266.2400000000002
okay stop won't go looking

2266.72 --> 2270.68
i don't know what that is

2311.28 --> 2315.119
okay where are you at leon

2317.44 --> 2320.88
i mean like the chat

2319.76 --> 2323.3590000000004
is kind of

2320.88 --> 2325.599
all over the world i myself am in the

2323.359 --> 2327.7599999999998
netherlands so

2325.599 --> 2329.6800000000003
when you say oh where i'm at that i

2327.76 --> 2330.88
don't necessarily then know where that

2329.68 --> 2332.7999999999997
is

2330.88 --> 2337.1600000000003
even if you did at one point mention

2332.8 --> 2337.1600000000003
where you live i just forgot

2340.88 --> 2346.32
south carolina right

2343.92 --> 2348.88
yeah so the united states yeah there is

2346.32 --> 2350.96
a dude the united states

2348.88 --> 2354.2400000000002
but just look at how much land bill

2350.96 --> 2356.16
gates is buying up alone

2354.24 --> 2357.2799999999997
like that is very

2356.16 --> 2361.359
very

2357.28 --> 2361.3590000000004
very worrisome

2361.68 --> 2365.68
i mean you thought that just gmo farmers

2364.48 --> 2369.68
were bad

2365.68 --> 2372.16
dude bill gates

2369.68 --> 2372.16
hello

2372.96 --> 2377.56
i mean i i don't get it

2390.88 --> 2394.2400000000002
i mean like

2393.52 --> 2397.839
i

2394.24 --> 2400.72
i just cannot imagine a person in the

2397.839 --> 2400.72
world i would

2400.8 --> 2407.3590000000004
want to have the land of my country less

2405.04 --> 2409.44
than bill gates i literally i'm thinking

2407.359 --> 2410.3199999999997
right i can't think of a single person

2409.44 --> 2412.4
in the world

2410.32 --> 2414.7200000000003
[Music]

2412.4 --> 2416.64
it's like the worst person you you could

2414.72 --> 2418.8799999999997
imagine to own

2416.64 --> 2419.7599999999998
farming land in your country

2418.88 --> 2422.96
really

2419.76 --> 2425.0400000000004
i just cannot figure out a single

2422.96 --> 2428.0
individual that's alive right now i

2425.04 --> 2430.64
would like to have that land less than

2428.0 --> 2430.64
bill gates

2431.599 --> 2435.6800000000003
all right

2433.76 --> 2437.119
i mean

2435.68 --> 2438.48
yeah

2437.119 --> 2441.359
i would rather

2438.48 --> 2443.28
have the land being bought

2441.359 --> 2446.48
by some communist

2443.28 --> 2448.88
chinese general

2446.48 --> 2452.359
than bill gates

2448.88 --> 2452.359
think about it

2465.68 --> 2469.1189999999997
i'm not joking guys

2471.44 --> 2476.7200000000003
i mean when i first heard that through

2473.76 --> 2479.0400000000004
news articles i would like i feels like

2476.72 --> 2484.7599999999998
my freaking stomach just fell out of my

2479.04 --> 2484.7599999999998
body like art you can't be serious

2504.8 --> 2508.4
involved in some community

2507.2 --> 2509.359
up

2508.4 --> 2512.319
well

2509.359 --> 2515.72
i'm not really a community guy

2512.319 --> 2515.72
borders boy

2522.88 --> 2526.6400000000003
i mean i have a community here on the

2525.2 --> 2529.359
internet

2526.64 --> 2533.2
the flat earth debates and crowds

2529.359 --> 2536.4
right i have my thing that i do here

2533.2 --> 2540.64
out here in the physical world

2536.4 --> 2543.52
not so much i'm i am still

2540.64 --> 2543.52
kind of a hermit

2545.2 --> 2550.16
right i'm

2546.4 --> 2552.319
not very eager to give that up

2550.16 --> 2554.16
just because i want a garden

2552.319 --> 2556.24
because that means i'm going to be

2554.16 --> 2558.24
attached to people

2556.24 --> 2561.4399999999996
that are going to have growing issues

2558.24 --> 2564.319
that they don't even see while i will

2561.44 --> 2566.96
remain seeing that

2564.319 --> 2568.56
and then having to hold on to oh what i

2566.96 --> 2571.44
want this garden so i have to tolerate

2568.56 --> 2573.52
them and then i'll go asymmetric and

2571.44 --> 2576.319
lose my focus and then i can't be an

2573.52 --> 2576.319
oracle anymore

2576.839 --> 2581.96
yeah so there's why

2600.96 --> 2606.28
yeah you hear correct you heard correct

2603.04 --> 2606.2799999999997
jim west

2610.87 --> 2613.989
[Music]

2626.16 --> 2631.52
wow that's [ __ ] up my young but that

2629.359 --> 2633.2799999999997
is just

2631.52 --> 2635.2
that's that's negligence on the

2633.28 --> 2638.4
government's part that's corruption then

2635.2 --> 2642.64
because that is extremely illegal

2638.4 --> 2646.079
yeah the workers might not give a [ __ ]

2642.64 --> 2648.16
but it's not dependent on if the locals

2646.079 --> 2650.2400000000002
care for their land being polluted or

2648.16 --> 2651.92
not whether that is allowed like

2650.24 --> 2655.1189999999997
anywhere in the world

2651.92 --> 2657.6800000000003
it's pretty much international

2655.119 --> 2659.119
except maybe like the worst third world

2657.68 --> 2662.8799999999997
countries where it's just like that

2659.119 --> 2664.56
nobody cares about anything

2662.88 --> 2666.319
right

2664.56 --> 2668.64
like uh

2666.319 --> 2671.359
this is called like somalia or something

2668.64 --> 2673.1189999999997
it's like yeah poison

2671.359 --> 2675.359
so what

2673.119 --> 2678.319
right but pretty much everywhere else

2675.359 --> 2678.319
united states

2678.4 --> 2682.1600000000003
europe most of it

2680.48 --> 2684.16
pretty much all of it yeah

2682.16 --> 2686.48
you just can't do that

2684.16 --> 2690.1189999999997
that's illegal the police should be

2686.48 --> 2690.119
arresting them

2695.76 --> 2699.92
and if they're not you should get like

2697.44 --> 2701.04
an entire news crew or infowars or

2699.92 --> 2703.76
something

2701.04 --> 2705.2
and cover it like oh look

2703.76 --> 2708.079
poison

2705.2 --> 2710.8799999999997
corrupt police is just letting it happen

2708.079 --> 2714.2400000000002
look at this poison take a sample

2710.88 --> 2714.2400000000002
bring it to like a uh

2714.96 --> 2719.28
like a chemist for

2717.04 --> 2721.599
for analysis and then just like yeah

2719.28 --> 2723.2000000000003
what are the consequences for the land

2721.599 --> 2724.56
right

2723.2 --> 2726.48
you could do that

2724.56 --> 2728.24
somebody could do that maybe you lay

2726.48 --> 2732.2400000000002
young maybe

2728.24 --> 2734.56
a documentary maker

2732.24 --> 2736.4799999999996
in the alternative news sector might be

2734.56 --> 2738.24
interested

2736.48 --> 2740.88
make an item out of it that's like the

2738.24 --> 2744.7599999999998
best way to really like kick him in the

2740.88 --> 2744.76
balls and make him stop

2749.28 --> 2755.4
totally are win it expose it

2752.4 --> 2755.4
what

2763.839 --> 2768.0
i'm just giving you some tips that's all

2768.48 --> 2772.079
i mean i would not

2770.48 --> 2774.72
tolerate it

2772.079 --> 2776.8
if i knew that like somebody out here is

2774.72 --> 2779.2
just like dumping poison in the water

2776.8 --> 2781.44
because they don't care i'd be like

2779.2 --> 2784.7599999999998
[ __ ] police right now

2781.44 --> 2784.76
you bastard

2790.11 --> 2800.0
[Music]

2798.8 --> 2803.3590000000004
anybody heard from mitchell from

2800.0 --> 2805.92
australia yeah len lenox

2803.359 --> 2811.319
uh yeah we're still getting like uh

2805.92 --> 2811.319
messages from him here on the skype chat

2816.96 --> 2823.4
it's winter now over there i think he's

2818.88 --> 2823.4
just like too busy to do videos

2829.74 --> 2832.9399999999996
[Music]

2853.28 --> 2857.0400000000004
okay

2854.559 --> 2859.44
well yeah it is a growing problem right

2857.04 --> 2861.2
the more technology you apply the less

2859.44 --> 2864.48
it becomes like farming and the less

2861.2 --> 2864.48
appealing it will become

2864.88 --> 2867.28
to

2865.839 --> 2869.2799999999997
younger people

2867.28 --> 2871.6800000000003
so in that sense

2869.28 --> 2873.8390000000004
maybe

2871.68 --> 2876.24
how about just

2873.839 --> 2878.7999999999997
taking it back a few steps

2876.24 --> 2880.3999999999996
right but just a few steps

2878.8 --> 2883.76
like

2880.4 --> 2887.28
get alternative amish

2883.76 --> 2889.119
i mean still allow a tractor right

2887.28 --> 2892.0
because the tractor is just like it's

2889.119 --> 2893.359
too good to lay down as a tool

2892.0 --> 2895.599
but

2893.359 --> 2895.5989999999997
like

2896.559 --> 2900.079
try to

2897.76 --> 2903.28
really as a farmer figure out wait like

2900.079 --> 2905.599
how do you keep the people

2903.28 --> 2905.599
in it

2905.839 --> 2911.7599999999998
like you have a couple of big machines

2908.16 --> 2911.7599999999998
to do like extreme work

2923.839 --> 2926.16
okay

2927.28 --> 2929.8390000000004
what

2953.76 --> 2957.28
right

2954.88 --> 2959.359
and i think there's there is probably a

2957.28 --> 2961.52
systemic issue even with it right the

2959.359 --> 2963.2
robotization

2961.52 --> 2964.4
of farming

2963.2 --> 2965.9199999999996
is

2964.4 --> 2968.079
interesting

2965.92 --> 2969.28
but it has a backlash it's so you could

2968.079 --> 2970.96
almost say

2969.28 --> 2973.119
it almost reminds me of like

2970.96 --> 2974.96
interstellar it's like yeah

2973.119 --> 2977.28
oh you got all these machines doing that

2974.96 --> 2978.8
well it's there's

2977.28 --> 2981.599
it will never

2978.8 --> 2984.079
truly solve the issues because

2981.599 --> 2987.04
here's a little piece of knowledge

2984.079 --> 2988.2400000000002
plants need attention

2987.04 --> 2990.96
robots

2988.24 --> 2993.4399999999996
don't really have a spirit to give

2990.96 --> 2995.92
attention they need people plants need

2993.44 --> 2999.76
people for interaction

2995.92 --> 3001.599
even if just a little bit right

2999.76 --> 3004.079
because like are

3001.599 --> 3005.839
just imagine a cattle farmer or some

3004.079 --> 3008.0
other animal

3005.839 --> 3010.4
and it's just robots you think that's

3008.0 --> 3013.2
gonna work or are they are the animals

3010.4 --> 3014.88
all gonna become depressed and sick

3013.2 --> 3016.48
pretty sure they're all going to become

3014.88 --> 3019.76
depressed and sick

3016.48 --> 3023.839
because they actually need the human

3019.76 --> 3023.8390000000004
they need the human caretakers

3024.64 --> 3028.64
and robots need mechanical maintenance

3026.72 --> 3030.319
as well there's that long-term problem

3028.64 --> 3031.359
through entropy that's right steamy

3030.319 --> 3034.64
traveler

3031.359 --> 3036.5589999999997
but also animals and plants

3034.64 --> 3041.2
need attention

3036.559 --> 3042.88
plants thrive if you touch their leaves

3041.2 --> 3046.72
if you talk to them

3042.88 --> 3049.6800000000003
and with animals it's even more palpable

3046.72 --> 3051.04
an animal thrives or

3049.68 --> 3053.04
withers

3051.04 --> 3055.7599999999998
based on what type of attention they're

3053.04 --> 3058.48
getting from their

3055.76 --> 3060.0
owner farmer

3058.48 --> 3063.28
right

3060.0 --> 3064.96
so robotization is like those are like

3063.28 --> 3067.2000000000003
assistance

3064.96 --> 3069.52
can be useful in very specific setups

3067.2 --> 3070.96
but you can't just replace all the

3069.52 --> 3073.599
workers

3070.96 --> 3075.52
you're going to need the crop pickers

3073.599 --> 3077.3590000000004
as well

3075.52 --> 3080.559
they give

3077.359 --> 3080.5589999999997
a little bit of spirit

3081.2 --> 3086.319
it makes everything better you need the

3083.839 --> 3088.24
people on the land doing things

3086.319 --> 3090.16
interacting with the plants to keep it

3088.24 --> 3093.359
really good

3090.16 --> 3095.92
this is probably also a reason why amish

3093.359 --> 3098.7999999999997
farming which is exactly how they do it

3095.92 --> 3102.88
is all hand-picking stuff

3098.8 --> 3104.6400000000003
why their food is so freaking amazing

3102.88 --> 3106.1600000000003
because their plants get all the

3104.64 --> 3109.04
attention

3106.16 --> 3111.7599999999998
yeah i'm calling it right here this is

3109.04 --> 3113.7599999999998
this is this is mechanical this is not

3111.76 --> 3116.7200000000003
some

3113.76 --> 3121.0400000000004
no this is a direct

3116.72 --> 3122.16
studyable very manipulatable consequence

3121.04 --> 3123.52
plants

3122.16 --> 3128.0789999999997
and animals

3123.52 --> 3131.2
need human interaction to thrive

3128.079 --> 3131.2000000000003
if they're going to be farm

3131.52 --> 3135.839
you can't all replace it with robots

3133.76 --> 3139.8390000000004
it's going to not work

3135.839 --> 3139.839
i promise you this

3179.04 --> 3185.2
yeah look if it's like gmo farming

3182.48 --> 3188.079
that's already like a fubar situation

3185.2 --> 3190.96
that's like anti-farming

3188.079 --> 3193.119
it's literally just creating poison

3190.96 --> 3195.44
poisoning the land and adding poison to

3193.119 --> 3198.88
the food cycle right i i'm not gonna

3195.44 --> 3201.2000000000003
even give them advice except never do it

3198.88 --> 3201.2000000000003
ever

3205.839 --> 3212.24
go eat your own gmo [ __ ] till you die

3209.359 --> 3215.24
because that's what will happen

3212.24 --> 3215.24
right

3228.72 --> 3233.04
right so yeah a couple of lessons i

3230.88 --> 3235.599
guess

3233.04 --> 3238.4
for the future yeah we got robotics we

3235.599 --> 3239.76
got development so handy it's so cool

3238.4 --> 3241.839
but

3239.76 --> 3244.7200000000003
if you think that that means that you

3241.839 --> 3247.7599999999998
can let the robots do all the work

3244.72 --> 3249.2799999999997
for you as a farmer on your farm

3247.76 --> 3252.3190000000004
just like

3249.28 --> 3254.48
some wealthy

3252.319 --> 3257.839
rich american

3254.48 --> 3259.76
somewhere mid-south is like oh yeah oh

3257.839 --> 3262.48
but there's all these people that will

3259.76 --> 3264.2400000000002
just work on my garden for very little

3262.48 --> 3266.48
money and then i can just do whatever i

3264.24 --> 3268.9599999999996
want and feel like i'm the boss right

3266.48 --> 3271.04
it's kind of the same situation yeah

3268.96 --> 3273.359
that situation is owen benjamin made

3271.04 --> 3275.7599999999998
like this hilarious sketch once it's

3273.359 --> 3275.7599999999998
like with

3277.52 --> 3282.72
red pill rooster

3280.24 --> 3285.2
made that made that animation

3282.72 --> 3285.2
like yeah

3286.48 --> 3290.319
that's not going to end well right well

3288.4 --> 3292.64
the same goes with farmers oh you think

3290.319 --> 3294.16
you can farm without humans you can take

3292.64 --> 3297.44
humans out of the picture and just all

3294.16 --> 3299.92
roboticize it well let's see how that

3297.44 --> 3299.92
ends up

3300.559 --> 3306.4
because i'm pretty sure that plants

3303.839 --> 3309.68
and animals even more need personal

3306.4 --> 3315.04
attention need a human being to be there

3309.68 --> 3317.68
not a robot that mimics like a human

3315.04 --> 3319.52
an actual one with a consciousness that

3317.68 --> 3321.52
can direct that consciousness and their

3319.52 --> 3324.4
spirit towards

3321.52 --> 3326.319
the living thing that is a plant that

3324.4 --> 3328.2400000000002
has their own spirit they need to be

3326.319 --> 3331.119
seen

3328.24 --> 3334.1189999999997
they need to be touched

3331.119 --> 3334.119
otherwise

3335.68 --> 3338.799
they're not gonna thrive

3339.119 --> 3343.2000000000003
like even if you beef them all up with

3341.52 --> 3345.68
artificial

3343.2 --> 3347.9199999999996
stuff like extra

3345.68 --> 3350.16
sneaky chemicals that'll make them help

3347.92 --> 3353.119
grow really amazingly

3350.16 --> 3355.44
it's still not going to be as good

3353.119 --> 3358.2400000000002
as when you just give all the plants

3355.44 --> 3361.28
personal attention

3358.24 --> 3363.7599999999998
so think about that carefully

3361.28 --> 3365.52
as you build towards the future of

3363.76 --> 3368.7990000000004
farming right

3365.52 --> 3372.079
don't overdo it with the robotics

3368.799 --> 3375.079
make sure to leave the humans in the

3372.079 --> 3375.079
process

3385.119 --> 3388.88
ah yeah thank you matthew yeah i did see

3387.44 --> 3391.839
you in chat there

3388.88 --> 3391.839
it was great

3393.83 --> 3402.96
[Music]

3401.04 --> 3405.2
hey price of adam

3402.96 --> 3408.2
you were on the fed yesterday that was

3405.2 --> 3408.2
hilarious

3410.93 --> 3415.58
[Music]

3423.599 --> 3426.0
hmm

3430.96 --> 3434.96
wheat plants

3433.359 --> 3437.68
you mean cannabis

3434.96 --> 3441.44
what are you talking about

3437.68 --> 3443.5989999999997
and why are you using insecticide

3441.44 --> 3446.76
doesn't that just effectively destroy

3443.599 --> 3446.76
the crop

3470.799 --> 3474.72
oh

3471.599 --> 3476.799
garlic pepper mint lemon water okay that

3474.72 --> 3479.9199999999996
doesn't sound very toxic

3476.799 --> 3479.92
does that actually work

3481.92 --> 3484.92
hmm

3489.839 --> 3492.88
okay interesting

3492.96 --> 3496.64
right but i'm gonna run out the show it

3494.799 --> 3498.72
was gonna be a very short show today

3496.64 --> 3500.96
anyway because i started up extremely

3498.72 --> 3500.9599999999996
late

3501.2 --> 3505.1189999999997
it's been

3502.64 --> 3505.1189999999997
pretty good

3506.64 --> 3511.359
mostly talking about farming

3509.119 --> 3514.4
and reflecting back on like yesterday's

3511.359 --> 3516.96
show with mandela effect a little

3514.4 --> 3518.96
but yeah i hope you enjoyed the show

3516.96 --> 3521.119
even though it was very short i will try

3518.96 --> 3524.16
to be back tomorrow just

3521.119 --> 3527.2000000000003
at a more regular time

3524.16 --> 3528.72
but yeah it was just a bit tense

3527.2 --> 3530.48
today

3528.72 --> 3532.72
so

3530.48 --> 3534.88
just wait a little longer before

3532.72 --> 3536.24
starting

3534.88 --> 3539.52
right

3536.24 --> 3542.24
but anyhow thanks everyone for coming i

3539.52 --> 3543.839
hope you liked this particular show if

3542.24 --> 3546.16
you did then please don't forget to
