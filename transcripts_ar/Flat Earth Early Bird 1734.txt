167.28 --> 173.94
cloudy windy rainy

171.06 --> 176.66
it was raining pretty much up until five

173.94 --> 176.66
minutes ago

177.42 --> 180.89999999999998
so

179.17 --> 182.819
[Music]

180.9 --> 185.06
it also cooled down compared to

182.819 --> 185.06
yesterday

186.599 --> 190.67999999999998
I think

188.34 --> 192.599
it does feel a bit cooler

190.68 --> 195.0
anyway

192.599 --> 198.23899999999998
low logical observations first in chat

195.0 --> 205.379
Bill Nye designs denier good to see you

198.239 --> 207.959
it is Friday the 29th of September 2023

205.379 --> 211.34
and yeah starting a bit late I'm sorry

207.959 --> 211.34
guys I'm having a lot of

211.879 --> 217.26
I'm having a bit of night Rhythm issues

214.98 --> 218.76
getting having a lot of trouble getting

217.26 --> 221.28
to sleep

218.76 --> 224.0
and getting up

221.28 --> 228.36
I don't know why that is

224.0 --> 230.099
uh what happened to the intro music what

228.36 --> 233.28
do you mean

230.099 --> 236.879
there was some intro music

233.28 --> 239.04
hold on let me retry that

236.879 --> 240.09
see if there's gonna be now I saw a

239.04 --> 244.98
sound

240.09 --> 246.599
[Music]

244.98 --> 249.92
yeah there is sound

246.599 --> 249.92
don't know what you're talking about

251.939 --> 255.68
hello love fruit good to see you

257.04 --> 265.139
oh yeah it was on your side I thought so

261.6 --> 265.139
right uh

268.02 --> 272.9
wow yeah it's gonna be a bit of a short

270.3 --> 272.90000000000003
show today

273.12 --> 279.9
but tomorrow and like Saturday Sunday I

277.32 --> 281.46
will have longer shows and yeah then I'm

279.9 --> 283.25899999999996
gonna have to worry

281.46 --> 286.4
about being a little later because I'll

283.259 --> 286.40000000000003
just go on later

287.4 --> 294.19899999999996
right but I'm here right now

290.46 --> 294.19899999999996
and I got some stuff to discuss

294.78 --> 300.78
yesterday on fed in the after show we we

298.62 --> 302.759
reviewed Rachel's video

300.78 --> 306.05999999999995
that was that's what that was addressed

302.759 --> 310.02000000000004
to me and it was

306.06 --> 312.3
quite ridiculous and hilarious really I

310.02 --> 314.46
had a we had some fun

312.3 --> 316.979
doing that

314.46 --> 319.79999999999995
because her video turned I didn't see it

316.979 --> 324.02
even before that review happened

319.8 --> 324.02000000000004
and it was just really silly

324.06 --> 330.6
like it my judgment overall is that

327.419 --> 332.82
whatever that was supposed to be it felt

330.6 --> 335.78000000000003
like a Sean Hawkins video where Sean

332.82 --> 339.06
Hawkins makes videos about me and then

335.78 --> 341.09999999999997
tries to like he thinks that he has a

339.06 --> 343.86
point about something but it like isn't

341.1 --> 346.44
a point at all it's really [ __ ] dumb

343.86 --> 350.58000000000004
and that is what this video was too I

346.44 --> 355.4
mean it was dumb taken out of context

350.58 --> 355.4
and like completely misunderstood

355.979 --> 361.52
is really silly

358.08 --> 361.52
anyway hello LSG

361.8 --> 365.78000000000003
Terry 306 good to see you

368.4 --> 374.06
he did it with flat Arthur too who did

371.88 --> 374.06
it

378.9 --> 384.73999999999995
who did

380.22 --> 384.74
it with flat Earth or two turret

386.66 --> 391.91900000000004
oh

388.199 --> 395.28000000000003
yeah sure I mean he LSG

391.919 --> 397.44
or I mean um turret sorry

395.28 --> 399.0
man I'm not very focused today I'm sorry

397.44 --> 401.28
this is

399.0 --> 404.46
but yeah Sean Hawkins made a bunch of

401.28 --> 408.25899999999996
videos about a whole bunch of people

404.46 --> 408.25899999999996
and it was always nonsense

408.96 --> 415.25899999999996
right but I'm just using it as an

411.3 --> 417.96000000000004
indicator like a feel indicator like

415.259 --> 420.66
when it's Sean Hawkins like when there's

417.96 --> 422.34
a Sean Hawkins video about me I'm never

420.66 --> 425.52000000000004
like oh [ __ ]

422.34 --> 427.25899999999996
I'm like oh my god what the [ __ ] does he

425.52 --> 430.56
think he has now

427.259 --> 432.6
like let's see if he can actually have a

430.56 --> 434.699
cohesive point this time and it's

432.6 --> 436.74
usually no

434.699 --> 438.539
or if it is a cohesive point and it's

436.74 --> 440.699
really not much of a point at all it's

438.539 --> 444.599
just some note

440.699 --> 447.90000000000003
like oh this yeah yeah that's not

444.599 --> 449.94
extraordinary at all

447.9 --> 450.84
and that's what reichi's video was like

449.94 --> 453.24
too

450.84 --> 454.85999999999996
didn't Sean delete his channel I don't

453.24 --> 456.84000000000003
know

454.86 --> 460.199
Bill Nye The Science and I have no idea

456.84 --> 464.039
I don't really follow him but I mean

460.199 --> 466.02000000000004
did he did he recently do that

464.039 --> 468.65999999999997
I don't know

466.02 --> 470.94
but he's made videos about me on this

468.66 --> 472.97900000000004
channel this year so

470.94 --> 477.139
if he's done that that must have

472.979 --> 477.139
happened recently I don't know

478.19 --> 481.29
[Music]

482.639 --> 487.44
you found me watching Sean's videos

485.4 --> 489.96
really

487.44 --> 492.62
holy [ __ ]

489.96 --> 492.62
okay

500.46 --> 506.539
he spreads misinformation yeah but does

503.4 --> 506.539
he tarot I mean

508.56 --> 516.86
I mean the word information is kind of a

511.919 --> 516.86
big word to to apply wouldn't you say

523.87 --> 527.149
[Music]

527.66 --> 531.959
right but anyway I wasn't really talking

530.1 --> 534.0600000000001
about Sean Hawkins because I didn't

531.959 --> 536.6999999999999
haven't checked it's just

534.06 --> 539.0999999999999
I use him as a standard it's like okay

536.7 --> 541.32
when somebody whatever whether they're a

539.1 --> 544.9200000000001
baller anti-flat Earth or a flat earther

541.32 --> 548.399
when they go really bad

544.92 --> 551.64
in their video quality like as in the

548.399 --> 553.98
point of it the context then I tend to

551.64 --> 556.5
call it Sean Hawkins level as an

553.98 --> 559.26
indicator it's just as a certain

556.5 --> 561.5
standard and I mean the guys at fed get

559.26 --> 561.5
that

562.68 --> 568.62
Brian says like oh my God you better not

565.58 --> 570.9590000000001
like oh once she finds out you call her

568.62 --> 573.66
Sean Hawkins level that's like a huge

570.959 --> 574.8
insult like yeah it kind of is but I

573.66 --> 577.9399999999999
mean

574.8 --> 577.9399999999999
it's true

578.279 --> 583.519
that video was really freaking silly

587.16 --> 594.26
did anybody actually watch it by the way

590.76 --> 594.26
I wouldn't blame you if you didn't

596.399 --> 601.58
Sean was trolling Jim Bob yeah yeah that

599.04 --> 601.5799999999999
too yeah

602.519 --> 608.1
yeah and so was Brenda

605.1 --> 611.58
I mean they were trolling him up until

608.1 --> 614.339
the point that he basically became

611.58 --> 618.24
yeah

614.339 --> 620.7600000000001
where he went full on religious art and

618.24 --> 623.399
went after own Benjamin and then they

620.76 --> 625.14
sort of stopped having interest or I

623.399 --> 627.0
think so or are they still hanging

625.14 --> 629.6999999999999
around I have no idea what Jim Bob's

627.0 --> 633.2
doing wasn't he behind the paywall now

629.7 --> 633.2
or something like that

633.68 --> 637.88
I have no idea what he's doing

640.38 --> 644.8389999999999
oh of course of course he did

645.6 --> 648.74
it's not surprising

653.94 --> 658.1400000000001
I must be all right since he doesn't

656.16 --> 660.12
like to yeah

658.14 --> 662.76
yeah and that's why I don't want Sean

660.12 --> 663.66
Hawkins channel to be taken down it's

662.76 --> 666.54
like

663.66 --> 668.579
his stuff isn't

666.54 --> 671.279
isn't

668.579 --> 673.5
damaging enough or is it dangerous

671.279 --> 675.6
enough to do anything it's just no just

673.5 --> 677.16
leave him there it's

675.6 --> 680.36
because it's a great advertisement

677.16 --> 680.36
because he doesn't like me

684.48 --> 689.24
right hey Dr Rutger good to see you

700.94 --> 707.8800000000001
I bought this boy

703.8 --> 710.959
why do you say something

707.88 --> 710.959
instead of something

711.18 --> 717.68
it is Jarred on The Heirs

714.66 --> 717.68
I disagree

720.779 --> 726.26
I mean yeah it's an Americanization but

723.54 --> 726.26
like

727.2 --> 730.82
sometimes they just talk like that

732.72 --> 736.339
I like sometimes

736.38 --> 739.3389999999999
or something

740.42 --> 745.1999999999999
I mean

742.68 --> 748.38
if I'm gonna like

745.2 --> 750.3000000000001
read out for the correct spelling or if

748.38 --> 753.18
I'm gonna be like on that yeah so sure

750.3 --> 755.459
I'll say something okay but I like to

753.18 --> 758.2399999999999
say something

755.459 --> 758.2399999999999
I'm sorry

765.42 --> 770.9399999999999
I mean the base method of my speech like

768.66 --> 774.48
what do you call that the vernacular no

770.94 --> 778.32
the the accent is I am talking American

774.48 --> 782.54
basically not completely though some

778.32 --> 782.5400000000001
parts I am a bit more English

782.94 --> 787.86
but I mean yeah this is this is my

785.82 --> 789.98
English I'm sorry this is just how we do

787.86 --> 789.98
it

795.24 --> 800.7
oh in the sun and the balcony oh are you

797.519 --> 804.019
lucky lucky man doctors here

800.7 --> 804.019
say it right damn it

809.04 --> 818.88
I see I prefer no I prefer I mean I I I

813.779 --> 818.88
very well appreciate English

819.6 --> 824.519
the original way of pronunciation

825.42 --> 832.139
but it takes a little more effort

829.44 --> 833.82
and I like American

832.139 --> 836.639
except when it's like

833.82 --> 838.32
overly American when like you just get

836.639 --> 840.8
it wrong or something that's just

838.32 --> 840.8000000000001
annoying

842.76 --> 848.42
so in that sense I'm like half American

845.76 --> 848.42
I guess

867.06 --> 873.1999999999999
you're in Poland okay

870.54 --> 873.1999999999999
huh

879.72 --> 886.62
going back to the Netherlands oh okay

882.959 --> 889.1389999999999
there's actually sun in the UK

886.62 --> 893.54
no no there isn't

889.139 --> 893.54
but he's in Poland

903.0 --> 906.62
hey Richard G good to see you

914.279 --> 919.399
all right so yeah I'll spare you to

916.139 --> 919.399
build a dash talk today

920.06 --> 925.9799999999999
already like I'm using steamy traveler

923.699 --> 929.06
on Skype to basically like oh look at

925.98 --> 929.0600000000001
this look at this look at this

929.88 --> 933.6
uh

931.5 --> 935.639
because it's all just freaking technical

933.6 --> 938.279
so there's oh I just rearranged this

935.639 --> 940.5
part oh this is much better now

938.279 --> 942.899
just like oh I just renamed this

940.5 --> 945.48
instruction it's much more efficient now

942.899 --> 948.839
much more logical I mean

945.48 --> 951.54
the action library is like really

948.839 --> 954.6800000000001
I've even like did you take a look by

951.54 --> 954.68
the way steamy Trevor

959.699 --> 966.3199999999999
but like I'm pretty Amazed by just by

962.279 --> 966.32
the action library now what it's called

967.8 --> 973.9799999999999
like you have like the the destruction

971.279 --> 975.72
the things like oh something explodes

973.98 --> 977.6990000000001
and then something else happens and

975.72 --> 980.4590000000001
whether that's an actual explosion or

977.699 --> 981.7199999999999
just an explosion on one square which

980.459 --> 984.5999999999999
could be a lot of different things

981.72 --> 986.399
that's destroyed but I call this all

984.6 --> 988.5600000000001
entropy

986.399 --> 991.019
because it's everything is changing into

988.56 --> 994.4399999999999
something else but it's all natural

991.019 --> 997.32
reactions so it's entropy so that those

994.44 --> 1001.8800000000001
actions are entropy actions pretty

997.32 --> 1005.36
awesome then there's density actions

1001.88 --> 1008.5
like being stuck in place like a wall or

1005.36 --> 1012.44
being buoyant floating up or floating

1008.5 --> 1014.6
floating at the same height but yeah

1012.44 --> 1018.3800000000001
technically that also means that it can

1014.6 --> 1020.0600000000001
be pushed for example upward

1018.38 --> 1022.04
that sort of thing

1020.06 --> 1023.7199999999999
when it's like when it's floating you

1022.04 --> 1027.079
can push things upward

1023.72 --> 1029.059
or soft falling when it isn't like it

1027.079 --> 1030.3799999999999
falls goes down but it doesn't damage

1029.059 --> 1032.8999999999999
anybody

1030.38 --> 1036.199
can't damage it just goes down and buff

1032.9 --> 1038.9
doesn't can't destroy anything that way

1036.199 --> 1041.8390000000002
and hard falling where it can and then

1038.9 --> 1043.459
there's also like pushable digable but

1041.839 --> 1045.1399999999999
I'm not even sure if I should classify

1043.459 --> 1046.819
it under that maybe I got a bit over

1045.14 --> 1049.2800000000002
enthusiastic thought that it would all

1046.819 --> 1051.5
fit but there's gonna be like exception

1049.28 --> 1054.02
type action that I can't really classify

1051.5 --> 1057.14
under specific categories but I was just

1054.02 --> 1061.1

1157.82 --> 1160.82
foreign

1162.82 --> 1166.539

like what was that exactly

1173.179 --> 1178.24
there was not as much news about it as

1175.76 --> 1178.24
you would think

1180.98 --> 1186.2
some kind of like maybe these sources

1183.679 --> 1187.94
that I am not finding articles that

1186.2 --> 1190.6000000000001

figure it out

1206.0 --> 1208.6

1261.919 --> 1268.4
beautiful I mean that's a really [ __ ]

1265.039 --> 1272.84
sadistic thing to do that guy I

1268.4 --> 1277.8400000000001
guarantee it I guarantee you is a

1272.84 --> 1277.84
full-blown psychopath guy's a psychopath

1280.1 --> 1284.799
you do that sort of thing you're a

1282.32 --> 1284.799
psychopath

1298.52 --> 1304.4
and I just stop oil oh well cool little

1302.78 --> 1307.1
Brian I don't really care I mean

1304.4 --> 1309.38
stopping oil is [ __ ]

1307.1 --> 1312.98
and you know who funds those [ __ ]

1309.38 --> 1316.1000000000001
[ __ ] kids and idiots that do that

1312.98 --> 1318.5
oil companies it's all [ __ ] [ __ ]

1316.1 --> 1320.98
you know what I think they're doing is

1318.5 --> 1320.98
they're just

1321.26 --> 1327.5
they're just like further

1324.38 --> 1329.6000000000001
like they have the Monopoly over it

1327.5 --> 1332.559
and they're just like destroying every

1329.6 --> 1332.559
form of competition

1334.34 --> 1340.8799999999999
stop oil just sounds like robber Baron's

1337.78 --> 1343.52
monopolizing even further on that

1340.88 --> 1347.0
resource that is definitely not gonna go

1343.52 --> 1350.3799999999999
away like that can never happen

1347.0 --> 1350.38
like it really can't

1355.88 --> 1359.0590000000002
[Music]

1359.179 --> 1364.5800000000002
right so they'll just

1361.4 --> 1368.1200000000001
like sit on every on all their stuff

1364.58 --> 1370.58
rubber Barons the Oil Barons they'll sit

1368.12 --> 1372.1999999999998
on their stuff they have enough money to

1370.58 --> 1375.799
live forever

1372.2 --> 1377.539
or live yeah to not have to do anything

1375.799 --> 1379.7
forever

1377.539 --> 1382.1
and then other people can't use oil

1379.7 --> 1384.02
other people can't start oil companies

1382.1 --> 1386.36
and then whenever they're needed they're

1384.02 --> 1388.4
like oh yeah here's I can

1386.36 --> 1390.8799999999999
give you oil right now

1388.4 --> 1390.88
right

1390.98 --> 1395.72
they fund it

1393.32 --> 1399.3799999999999
like trace it

1395.72 --> 1402.6200000000001
Trace who pays this stuff who helps them

1399.38 --> 1406.24
out or funds them whatever

1402.62 --> 1406.2399999999998
it's oil companies

1407.9 --> 1412.88
or sometimes like through some other

1410.539 --> 1414.799
organization well that they definitely

1412.88 --> 1418.22
give a lot of money to because they do

1414.799 --> 1421.28
oil companies actually sponsor like

1418.22 --> 1424.34
climate change based organizations they

1421.28 --> 1427.72
do they help pretty much erect them as a

1424.34 --> 1427.72
thing in this [ __ ] world

1443.419 --> 1446.419
okay

1448.88 --> 1451.179
foreign

1455.799 --> 1460.1
gluing their hands to the street yeah

1457.94 --> 1462.8600000000001
well I'm all for that part

1460.1 --> 1465.08
I mean dude just glue themselves to the

1462.86 --> 1468.9799999999998
street like their entire body

1465.08 --> 1472.0
do it just glue themselves to the street

1468.98 --> 1472.0
and then it's done

1477.559 --> 1482.539
next time just don't just do your hands

1480.26 --> 1484.64
just do your entire body

1482.539 --> 1487.94
just glue them to the street man it's

1484.64 --> 1490.8200000000002
the ultimate protest and then yeah then

1487.94 --> 1494.02
no more protests isn't that great that's

1490.82 --> 1494.02
whatever everybody wins

1495.86 --> 1499.7199999999998
hey antiluvian catharsis

1509.36 --> 1514.4189999999999
yes antilipian catharsis indeed I mean

1512.12 --> 1516.3799999999999
climate change movement is an

1514.419 --> 1520.659
anti-environmentalist movement

1516.38 --> 1523.8200000000002
it's a co-opt movement

1520.659 --> 1525.919
to draw attention away from actual

1523.82 --> 1530.1399999999999
pollution

1525.919 --> 1530.14
actual toxic pollution

1531.02 --> 1533.5
right

1545.299 --> 1551.5
just a layer of asphalt on top of them

1548.9 --> 1555.46
seems yes

1551.5 --> 1555.46
eventually Dr utker

1558.98 --> 1563.299
although no but it that is not good

1561.32 --> 1565.7
though because it would leave like this

1563.299 --> 1568.4
whole these holes the very unstable road

1565.7 --> 1571.279
so it's better to just like

1568.4 --> 1574.76
I don't know just get Jack like to get

1571.279 --> 1577.64
Jack Harris and just just Hammer them

1574.76 --> 1580.46
out you know so they're like kind of you

1577.64 --> 1582.8600000000001
could pull them out like uh like Han

1580.46 --> 1584.72
Solo frozen in carbonate except it's in

1582.86 --> 1586.3999999999999
a piece of Street glued in a piece of

1584.72 --> 1587.6000000000001
Street and you just pull them away and

1586.4 --> 1592.8400000000001
then

1587.6 --> 1592.84
and then like make a new Street there

1595.039 --> 1597.64
foreign

1610.48 --> 1615.6200000000001
that's [ __ ] up blood logical and

1613.22 --> 1616.88
that's just that's just too far man come

1615.62 --> 1620.3799999999999
on

1616.88 --> 1620.38
come on what do you think this is China

1620.96 --> 1623.44
bro

1635.74 --> 1641.72
by the way we're not seeing any freaking

1638.539 --> 1644.74
climate protests in China by the way

1641.72 --> 1644.74
why would that be

1660.02 --> 1665.12
no but what I what I'm feeling about the

1662.84 --> 1668.779
whole situation like this climate change

1665.12 --> 1672.34
freaks sjw freaks

1668.779 --> 1674.24
because black lives mattered

1672.34 --> 1676.82
antifa

1674.24 --> 1679.46
they're all organizations that are all

1676.82 --> 1681.5
getting worse and worse burdensome on

1679.46 --> 1685.76
the public and they are going to lead

1681.5 --> 1689.36
like they're creating basically

1685.76 --> 1690.799
they're trying to just harass and troll

1689.36 --> 1694.6999999999998
people

1690.799 --> 1698.12
and yeah get on their nerves until the

1694.7 --> 1700.76
people are ready to basically

1698.12 --> 1702.9799999999998
throw away freedom and embrace

1700.76 --> 1706.039
dictatorship just to stop them right

1702.98 --> 1709.46
dictatorship like I don't know communism

1706.039 --> 1713.24
right because in China there's not these

1709.46 --> 1714.8600000000001
[ __ ] [ __ ] climate protests

1713.24 --> 1715.76
they're not blocking the streets over

1714.86 --> 1718.52
there

1715.76 --> 1720.86
they get arrested immediately very

1718.52 --> 1723.9189999999999
rough-handedly

1720.86 --> 1727.6399999999999
yes it's just illegal if you go to jail

1723.919 --> 1729.8600000000001
for for years if you do that once

1727.64 --> 1731.659
they don't [ __ ] tolerate that [ __ ]

1729.86 --> 1734.9599999999998
and people over here will eventually

1731.659 --> 1736.159
will be like yeah it's all chaos like

1734.96 --> 1738.799
this government's just letting

1736.159 --> 1741.3200000000002
everything burn down like maybe we

1738.799 --> 1744.1399999999999
should just have a dictatorship so like

1741.32 --> 1747.26
we really can go after these people and

1744.14 --> 1749.72
not be stopped

1747.26 --> 1752.24
I mean

1749.72 --> 1754.22
that's in a way how I feel and I know

1752.24 --> 1757.6
it's not good

1754.22 --> 1757.6000000000001
but I feel like that

1757.7 --> 1763.7
it's always like I just want to solve it

1760.46 --> 1767.559
right now like right now

1763.7 --> 1771.38
like no holes of just [ __ ] Solve IT

1767.559 --> 1774.32
violence and all bang just do it like oh

1771.38 --> 1776.8400000000001
we can't help oh my military oh military

1774.32 --> 1779.84
can have the military with heavy

1776.84 --> 1779.84
equipment

1780.2 --> 1785.3600000000001
just [ __ ] get him

1783.14 --> 1786.7990000000002
but yeah what do you do after that you

1785.36 --> 1789.3799999999999
know that's the problem

1786.799 --> 1791.799
are we going to rebuild a society once

1789.38 --> 1791.7990000000002
that's happened

1791.84 --> 1796.52
that's

1793.299 --> 1800.74
very very complicated

1796.52 --> 1800.74
and usually always goes wrong

1800.96 --> 1804.74
[Music]

1802.12 --> 1807.9399999999998
so I'm just gonna leave it to ranting

1804.74 --> 1807.94
and raving on my show

1836.059 --> 1841.1
tell me young love no it was g no [ __ ]

1839.84 --> 1843.6399999999999
you

1841.1 --> 1843.6399999999999
no

1846.5 --> 1853.34
they shouldn't [ __ ] carve into trees

1849.26 --> 1855.44
in the first place I find that atrocious

1853.34 --> 1857.6
I think that should be punishable it's

1855.44 --> 1860.779
like no you're not touching that [ __ ]

1857.6 --> 1864.4399999999998
tree you got it [ __ ]

1860.779 --> 1867.5
with your [ __ ] [ __ ] love

1864.44 --> 1870.38
your infatuations no you aren't touching

1867.5 --> 1872.179
the tree yeah go carve it in your own

1870.38 --> 1875.14
[ __ ] Tree in your own [ __ ] house

1872.179 --> 1875.14
ass wipe

1875.299 --> 1882.7
public tree carving should be like a

1878.299 --> 1882.7
jailable offense in my in my opinion

1883.7 --> 1888.94
I mean it

1886.1 --> 1888.9399999999998
I hate it

1889.84 --> 1895.22
I don't like to see it

1892.7 --> 1898.22
it's not good not good for the trees

1895.22 --> 1898.22
ever

1914.24 --> 1918.3990000000001
still tap tree yeah but that's different

1918.44 --> 1925.1000000000001
that's a farmed tree that's like not

1922.399 --> 1927.559
anybody can just like oh yeah anybody

1925.1 --> 1930.26
could just walk in there and just like

1927.559 --> 1933.44
chop it or whatever right no no because

1930.26 --> 1935.6
those are trees that are literally being

1933.44 --> 1937.76
farmed for that

1935.6 --> 1940.1
pretty damn sure that only the person

1937.76 --> 1942.679
that owns that lot

1940.1 --> 1945.08
with those trees is allowed to do that

1942.679 --> 1947.6200000000001
yeah that's a very big difference there

1945.08 --> 1947.62
though fruit

1959.36 --> 1962.1999999999998
foreign

1969.02 --> 1974.6
yeah that's right

1971.62 --> 1975.9799999999998
psychological case or also known as

1974.6 --> 1978.62
psychopath

1975.98 --> 1982.48
just a [ __ ] little psychopath

1978.62 --> 1982.4799999999998
I hope they break his legs in jail

1999.34 --> 2004.84
that seemed chopped down a tree from a

2003.46 --> 2005.5
wheelchair

2004.84 --> 2008.549
[ __ ]

2005.5 --> 2008.549
[Music]

2050.919 --> 2053.919
foreign

2059.5 --> 2067.72
but yeah what's happening like in

2062.44 --> 2067.7200000000003
politics it's all become 100 political

2067.96 --> 2074.46
it's like they're

2070.3 --> 2080.619
the liberal Imperium like literally like

2074.46 --> 2084.639
100 does not care anymore about anything

2080.619 --> 2087.94
they only care about power

2084.639 --> 2090.96
it's so hundred percent no I'm not vegan

2087.94 --> 2090.96
Arthur B flat hello

2091.119 --> 2093.54
okay

2100.599 --> 2103.1400000000003
all right

2104.98 --> 2112.5
the liver Imperium should fall because

2107.859 --> 2112.5
they have become totally dysfunctional

2115.3 --> 2121.1800000000003
the entire faction this side

2118.599 --> 2123.28
the in in a struggle in the political

2121.18 --> 2127.44
struggle it doesn't care anymore about

2123.28 --> 2127.44
anything but retaining power

2127.78 --> 2132.6400000000003
and making everybody [ __ ]

2130.96 --> 2134.98
they want that they want to make

2132.64 --> 2137.7599999999998
everybody [ __ ] because that way they

2134.98 --> 2137.76
can retain power

2139.14 --> 2144.7599999999998
and they're really using psychological

2142.48 --> 2146.7400000000002
warfare to actually try to achieve that

2144.76 --> 2151.98
they have for some time

2146.74 --> 2151.9799999999996

2175.18 --> 2180.7799999999997
I call it the liberal Imperium though

2177.339 --> 2180.7799999999997
it's not really liberalism

2183.5 --> 2188.26
[Music]

2185.859 --> 2190.18
I mean in the 90s you could say that was

2188.26 --> 2193.0
liberalism right

2190.18 --> 2195.22
what did what that is now that has apps

2193.0 --> 2198.54
like the word liberal

2195.22 --> 2202.66
doesn't fit anywhere on there

2198.54 --> 2205.24
right in Liberal Imperium is also the

2202.66 --> 2206.6189999999997
words are technically self-contradicting

2205.24 --> 2209.9199999999996
setup

2206.619 --> 2212.079
it's a paradoxical statement yeah can

2209.92 --> 2214.66
have an Imperium if it's liberal because

2212.079 --> 2216.4
it's Liberal Liberal Imperium is

2214.66 --> 2219.52
self-contradiction but it's on purpose

2216.4 --> 2221.619
because that is what they are

2219.52 --> 2224.02
they're the hundred percent Pretenders

2221.619 --> 2226.96
so they pretend to be the good guys are

2224.02 --> 2230.44
not doing a good job at it

2226.96 --> 2232.359
they just use the clothes and the words

2230.44 --> 2234.82
and just call themselves continually

2232.359 --> 2236.02
it's a Non-Stop gaslighting act and they

2234.82 --> 2239.1400000000003
are

2236.02 --> 2243.42
total power hungry demons

2239.14 --> 2243.42
that don't care about anything but Power

2245.619 --> 2252.099
I I would have never believed it could

2248.5 --> 2254.32
have got gotten this bad publicly

2252.099 --> 2256.1800000000003
like 20 years ago I would have never

2254.32 --> 2257.6800000000003
believed that it would have become this

2256.18 --> 2260.2
bad

2257.68 --> 2263.7
if I hadn't literally experienced it

2260.2 --> 2263.7
through the dark world that is

2267.76 --> 2271.7400000000002
it's just that now that I'm actually

2269.859 --> 2274.42
experienced it

2271.74 --> 2278.0989999999997
experiencing it

2274.42 --> 2278.099
in the normal timeline

2278.22 --> 2285.04
I still can't believe it

2281.859 --> 2286.5989999999997
I mean yeah I saw it but even when I saw

2285.04 --> 2288.579
it in the dark world I couldn't believe

2286.599 --> 2290.44
it and now that I'm seeing it in the

2288.579 --> 2292.1800000000003
real world I still can't believe it I

2290.44 --> 2297.42
can't believe it's this bad

2292.18 --> 2297.4199999999996
I can't believe people allow themselves

2297.579 --> 2305.04
that this can happen to people

2299.98 --> 2305.04
for me it is like a really bad sign

2306.7 --> 2312.7799999999997
and for my like it is influencing me I

2310.359 --> 2316.9
mean it has

2312.78 --> 2319.0600000000004
irrevocably damaged my overall trust in

2316.9 --> 2321.88
humanity

2319.06 --> 2325.14
on all kinds of levels

2321.88 --> 2325.1400000000003

2325.48 --> 2330.46
are demonic

2327.82 --> 2332.02
in nature they have that in them and

2330.46 --> 2334.92
once they start giving in then there's

2332.02 --> 2334.92
no more limits

2346.06 --> 2350.38

poorest people and poorest Nation have a

lot of children right

2535.839 --> 2544.5
they also lose a lot of children but

2540.099 --> 2544.5
they don't tell you that part do they

2554.5 --> 2558.04
you think they all grow up to be adults

2556.78 --> 2559.78
do you

2558.04 --> 2561.64
no

2559.78 --> 2563.38

2561.64 --> 2566.74
children

2563.38 --> 2569.2000000000003
because if you don't well then it might

2566.74 --> 2572.0789999999997
just be over just like that

2569.2 --> 2573.9399999999996
you could be completely wiped out

2572.079 --> 2576.82
if you have a lot of children well then

2573.94 --> 2578.98
you're certain that there will be some

2576.82 --> 2580.3590000000004
of the Next Generation that will carry

2578.98 --> 2582.099
through and take care of you when you're

2580.359 --> 2586.2599999999998

okay I'm not gonna read this dude this

2620.98 --> 2623.7
is way too big

2625.96 --> 2632.099
but thanks for the link I guess hey Dan

2629.5 --> 2632.099
good to you

2666.339 --> 2671.88
oh by the way there's this local news

2669.4 --> 2674.5
article going around in the Netherlands

2671.88 --> 2678.52
apparently there's these

2674.5 --> 2680.44
wine Farmers here in the Netherlands

2678.52 --> 2682.24
that like grow their own grapes and all

2680.44 --> 2684.76
that

2682.24 --> 2687.7
and what was it they had upped their

2684.76 --> 2691.42
production very stably

2687.7 --> 2694.48
foreign by like 800 percent or something

2691.42 --> 2697.78
I might be wrong maybe less but a

2694.48 --> 2702.04
significant multiplier

2697.78 --> 2706.02
when they decided to continually play

2702.04 --> 2706.02
very specific classical music

2706.42 --> 2713.38
to the the grapevines

2710.2 --> 2715.96
that literal speakers

2713.38 --> 2718.5
and since they started doing that their

2715.96 --> 2724.68
production like

2718.5 --> 2724.68
multiply 8 4 or something like holy [ __ ]

2729.099 --> 2734.1400000000003
Eightfold or four-fold or whatever oh a

2732.4 --> 2736.06
huge difference

2734.14 --> 2738.339
so that's going around and that's really

2736.06 --> 2741.52
fascinating and awesome

2738.339 --> 2743.44
and everybody in the chat there or in

2741.52 --> 2747.099
the comment section recognize also like

2743.44 --> 2749.319
hey that's Dr Emoto

2747.099 --> 2752.7400000000002
his work right

2749.319 --> 2754.48
the oh the the claimed pseudoscientists

2752.74 --> 2756.5789999999997
oh it's a pseudoscientist yeah he's

2754.48 --> 2759.4
[ __ ] right though it's absolutely

2756.579 --> 2761.5
true and this is like a direct proof of

2759.4 --> 2763.98
it

2761.5 --> 2763.98
foreign

2764.46 --> 2770.079
people don't really want to recognize it

2767.5 --> 2772.599
but yeah the production has been

2770.079 --> 2775.1800000000003
fourfold ever since they started doing

2772.599 --> 2778.54
that yeah

2775.18 --> 2781.74
so oh but not scientific though

2778.54 --> 2781.74
it's only a direct

2782.38 --> 2786.2400000000002
thing you're varying and manipulating

2786.579 --> 2791.579
even though yeah music is man-made yeah

2792.22 --> 2798.64
but the results are there

2795.28 --> 2801.42
and by the way people out there it's all

2798.64 --> 2805.7999999999997
[ __ ] I mean it's it's scientific

2907.3 --> 2911.6800000000003
what happened with him and re I don't

2909.579 --> 2914.079
know what the [ __ ] had did happen with

2911.68 --> 2916.66
him and reichi did anything happen with

him and reichi

2916.66 --> 2919.319
what

2921.4 --> 2926.2000000000003
George Sanford is weirdly obsessed yeah

2924.22 --> 2928.9599999999996
I guess well since I called him a

2926.2 --> 2931.5989999999997
[ __ ] [ __ ] for being a concaver

2928.96 --> 2934.06
and literally having no arguments

2931.599 --> 2936.7000000000003
whatsoever about it and still holding on

2934.06 --> 2938.44
yeah I called him an open [ __ ] and I

2936.7 --> 2940.7799999999997
meant it and he's been pissed off ever

2938.44 --> 2943.9
since he hasn't really come back

2940.78 --> 2947.26
so yeah

2943.9 --> 2950.26
I guess he's gonna go on a gamma spiral

2947.26 --> 2953.619
go [ __ ] [ __ ] on me and everybody

2950.26 --> 2955.6600000000003
else like what happened

2953.619 --> 2957.7000000000003
what what tends to happen a lot also

2955.66 --> 2959.3799999999997
with uh you know Owen Benjamin and all

2957.7 --> 2962.7599999999998
these people

2959.38 --> 2962.76
that just go flip out

2963.04 --> 2967.599
Sanford took it personally yeah he

2965.14 --> 2970.18
should it was personally I think he's

2967.599 --> 2972.46
personally a [ __ ] [ __ ]

2970.18 --> 2978.1189999999997
for believing in something that he has

2972.46 --> 2982.119
absolutely no no capability of even

2978.119 --> 2985.06
engaging in attempting to prove okay

2982.119 --> 2989.099
it's embarrassing as hell I'd rather

2985.06 --> 2989.099
have a [ __ ] ball tart in my Jack

2990.52 --> 2995.38
he should take it personally it was

personal he's a [ __ ] [ __ ] for

2995.38 --> 2999.88
believing that

2997.54 --> 3002.22
a [ __ ] [ __ ] you hear me George

2999.88 --> 3005.04
Sanford you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] for

3005.04 --> 3012.54
you have absolutely no

no grasp no hint nothing to actually

3012.54 --> 3018.2599999999998
lead you to assume that the Earth is

3015.119 --> 3018.26
concave nothing

3019.92 --> 3026.28
it's inexcusably [ __ ] so yeah you

3024.359 --> 3028.619
should take it personally it is very

3026.28 --> 3030.3590000000004
personal that you're [ __ ] [ __ ]

3028.619 --> 3034.44
for believing in something that there

3030.359 --> 3038.9
isn't even a hint of existing

yeah that's [ __ ] [ __ ]

3040.619 --> 3045.2400000000002

3042.96 --> 3048.2400000000002
be very [ __ ] embarrassed for himself

3045.24 --> 3052.5589999999997

something without any form of reason or

3052.559 --> 3058.3390000000004
logic whatsoever

3054.859 --> 3058.339
none nothing

3073.8 --> 3078.38
why did you think George was a flat

3076.079 --> 3078.38
earther

3078.78 --> 3084.7400000000002
I don't know

3081.18 --> 3084.74
I don't know what you thought that

3094.04 --> 3100.02
he was playing around no tear it no no

3097.26 --> 3102.78
he is a concaver

3100.02 --> 3105.68
he really is a concave he just kept it

3102.78 --> 3105.6800000000003
silent for years

3107.52 --> 3113.22
then concavity never came up

3110.46 --> 3115.44
didn't you notice how he like never

3113.22 --> 3119.2999999999997
really

3115.44 --> 3119.3
said anything Flat Earth

3119.64 --> 3123.48

into the [ __ ] [ __ ] things you

3134.7 --> 3141.24
believe in

3137.22 --> 3144.9199999999996

3167.339 --> 3170.24
did you hang on that

definitely concave

3196.92 --> 3201.079
you're just a liar now George Sanford

3210.0 --> 3212.24
foreign

3220.14 --> 3224.8799999999997
I even have a concave in here called

3222.66 --> 3226.92
George McCormack and he knows he's

3224.88 --> 3229.559
[ __ ] [ __ ] and he knows he should

3226.92 --> 3231.2400000000002
shut the [ __ ] up about it

3229.559 --> 3232.98
or I'll kick him out

3231.24 --> 3235.02
and he can even hang around here he's

3232.98 --> 3236.94
just fine with that because he just

3235.02 --> 3239.16
knows he's kind of [ __ ] for his

3236.94 --> 3241.619
belief okay

3239.16 --> 3245.22
you defended it

3241.619 --> 3247.4
can't prove any of them oh yeah yeah I

3245.22 --> 3247.3999999999996
can

3248.819 --> 3253.74
I mean I'd have to find back the show

3251.099 --> 3257.7200000000003
but yeah I can definitely do that giving

3253.74 --> 3257.72
me free advertising yeah I know I are

3265.859 --> 3268.859
okay

3272.76 --> 3275.0
foreign

3319.099 --> 3323.6600000000003
for the PayPal I appreciate that

3339.72 --> 3343.68
should be happy I'm getting all your

3341.52 --> 3346.22
wisdom out there oh yes George Sanford

3343.68 --> 3346.22
sure

3346.26 --> 3348.5
foreign

3349.16 --> 3355.44
if you think you can do anything to me

3352.74 --> 3357.7799999999997
you're sorely mistaken okay George

3355.44 --> 3358.68
Sanford you're a [ __ ] gamma piece of

3357.78 --> 3363.1800000000003
[ __ ]

3358.68 --> 3365.819
you're acting like a gamma you're a liar

3363.18 --> 3368.52
and you can't intimidate me with your

3365.819 --> 3370.92
[ __ ] [ __ ] yeah

3368.52 --> 3373.14
try all you like what you think that you

3370.92 --> 3374.94
can make a good video oh you think you

3373.14 --> 3377.52
could do a better job than reichi good

3374.94 --> 3379.619
luck with that man good luck

3377.52 --> 3381.78
yeah I know I have lots of material you

3379.619 --> 3384.42
can add it together and make it seem

3381.78 --> 3386.46
really weird yeah I know yeah doesn't

3384.42 --> 3389.579
really work though

3386.46 --> 3393.079
so you could all try to do that it's not

3389.579 --> 3393.079
gonna work though

3393.839 --> 3398.88
people that have actually watched me

3396.42 --> 3401.119
they understand when those things come

3398.88 --> 3401.119
from

3403.28 --> 3407.46
[Music]

3404.359 --> 3410.18
without edit just share good you just

3407.46 --> 3410.18
share then

3415.319 --> 3417.5589999999997
oh

3417.9 --> 3420.079
foreign

3426.619 --> 3432.44
oh like uh

3429.2 --> 3432.4399999999996
scored a stone

3432.72 --> 3437.359
at Owen Benjamin remember that did you

3435.059 --> 3437.3590000000004
see that

3438.359 --> 3442.68
yeah that's what George reminds me of

3440.46 --> 3444.7200000000003
right now

3442.68 --> 3447.2999999999997
that's what I'm saying like he's a full

3444.72 --> 3449.7599999999998
gamma I mean

3447.3 --> 3453.54
that's the one yeah yeah that's Curtis

3449.76 --> 3456.059
Stone Urban Farmer or scordus stone as

3453.54 --> 3459.859
he's now called

3456.059 --> 3459.8590000000004
yeah I went full I'm crazy

3475.16 --> 3480.2999999999997
why don't I make a video about George

3477.96 --> 3482.819
Sanford never because I don't do that

3480.3 --> 3485.2200000000003
haven't you noticed that I don't do that

3482.819 --> 3486.66
sort of dumb [ __ ]

3485.22 --> 3489.48
I don't do that

3486.66 --> 3491.52
like everybody else can do that you know

3489.48 --> 3494.119
I don't do that because I think it's

3491.52 --> 3494.119
pitiful

3494.339 --> 3500.04
if it's worth talking about then I'll

3497.16 --> 3502.68
talk about it on my show

3500.04 --> 3504.119
I'm not gonna make separate videos about

3502.68 --> 3506.5789999999997
that yeah

3504.119 --> 3508.44
it just leads to more [ __ ] drama

3506.579 --> 3510.3590000000004
anyway like as soon as you start making

3508.44 --> 3512.88
those things suddenly all the [ __ ]

3510.359 --> 3514.68
trolls all go on your ass and they start

3512.88 --> 3515.7000000000003
to think that they can have an influence

3514.68 --> 3518.7599999999998
again

3515.7 --> 3521.0989999999997
because you make response videos yeah

3518.76 --> 3523.44
I don't make response videos like that I

3521.099 --> 3526.1600000000003
I make mentions of things when I find it

3523.44 --> 3526.16
worth mentioning

3528.54 --> 3531.54
hmm

3532.26 --> 3535.26
squirtismonia

3538.14 --> 3543.0
yes of course George

3540.18 --> 3546.0789999999997
he jumped in right right when he noticed

3543.0 --> 3546.079
I was talking about it

3547.559 --> 3552.9
because I'm pretty sure that he's still

3549.96 --> 3555.42
watching the show he what he dude

3552.9 --> 3558.38
George Sanford has built up a habit of

3555.42 --> 3558.38
watching this show

3558.839 --> 3566.099
and then I went off off on him and he

3563.16 --> 3568.799
says now oh that's not legitimate I

3566.099 --> 3571.7400000000002
never was a concaver yeah sure you

3568.799 --> 3573.9
weren't yeah like that's how that works

3571.74 --> 3577.3799999999997
sure

3573.9 --> 3580.92
yeah if you really weren't a concave or

3577.38 --> 3583.079
you would have probably like sent me an

3580.92 --> 3585.2400000000002
elaborate email telling me like look

3583.079 --> 3588.54
dude I don't know how you think I'm a

3585.24 --> 3590.8799999999997
concaver but I really am not this is why

3588.54 --> 3593.7599999999998
I talked to I was just in the moment you

3590.88 --> 3596.819
would have actually like contacted me

3593.76 --> 3597.599
about it and got gotten serious you

3596.819 --> 3602.64
didn't

3597.599 --> 3605.4
so you're just a lying gamma ass face

3602.64 --> 3608.0
right now George Sanford

3605.4 --> 3608.0
okay

3615.54 --> 3621.119
right and you can't let go of the stream

3618.059 --> 3623.2200000000003
because well it's like a long-term

3621.119 --> 3624.7200000000003
relationship you know just because your

3623.22 --> 3627.319
breakup doesn't mean that you're

3624.72 --> 3627.319
suddenly gonna

3627.42 --> 3632.28
go with oh Lord I'm gonna live somewhere

3629.7 --> 3633.839
else never see it again no no you it's

3632.28 --> 3634.7400000000002
really tough when you're used to it

3633.839 --> 3636.7799999999997
right

3634.74 --> 3638.16
and even though you're hostile you still

3636.78 --> 3639.5400000000004
don't really want to go I know what

3638.16 --> 3643.02
that's like I

3639.54 --> 3645.24
lived with my ex for a year after she

3643.02 --> 3648.299
broke up with me

3645.24 --> 3651.1189999999997
it's really difficult for me so I get it

3648.299 --> 3654.18
it's very strenuous very painful and

3651.119 --> 3656.94
leads to a lot of hurt doesn't it

3654.18 --> 3658.68
right or

3656.94 --> 3660.839
or you could have just done the right

3658.68 --> 3664.2
thing and

3660.839 --> 3666.68
reached out to me in private not be a

3664.2 --> 3666.68
[ __ ]

3667.14 --> 3671.64
and just like explain exactly how I was

3670.319 --> 3674.099
wrong

3671.64 --> 3675.839
and what your position is and that you

3674.099 --> 3678.0
would like to continue on and then I

3675.839 --> 3679.619
would have given you all that

3678.0 --> 3685.64
but you didn't

3679.619 --> 3685.6400000000003
no this was the last straw or something

3685.859 --> 3691.52
right

3687.299 --> 3691.52
and now you're just a gamma [ __ ]

3698.22 --> 3701.0
foreign

3701.45 --> 3706.3799999999997
[Music]

3703.94 --> 3707.76
yeah yeah you just lied in the chat

3706.38 --> 3709.7400000000002
[ __ ]

3707.76 --> 3712.559
yeah

3709.74 --> 3715.799
about your concavity

3712.559 --> 3717.8390000000004
you said that you were in the concave

3715.799 --> 3720.18
you you started saying that in this chat

3717.839 --> 3722.2799999999997
wow at the time where we got in this

3720.18 --> 3723.66
rock as I went off on you for being a

3722.28 --> 3726.5400000000004
concave her

3723.66 --> 3728.7599999999998
because you literally in text

3726.54 --> 3733.579
said that

3728.76 --> 3737.0400000000004
I didn't even delete it okay

3733.579 --> 3740.28
you said that George Sanford

3737.04 --> 3741.9
I checked your account to see whether it

3740.28 --> 3744.8590000000004
was really you

3741.9 --> 3744.859
and it was

3748.2 --> 3754.02
you're the one I got into a hassle with

3751.38 --> 3757.2000000000003
over concave I called you a [ __ ]

3754.02 --> 3759.42
[ __ ] worse than a baller worse than an

3757.2 --> 3760.5589999999997
anti-flat earther you got really pissed

3759.42 --> 3763.619
off

3760.559 --> 3766.6800000000003
you went away for a while and now you

3763.619 --> 3771.119
come back and you're lying you're a

3766.68 --> 3773.819
lying scumbag about your position

3771.119 --> 3775.7400000000002
you're lying are you saying that you're

3773.819 --> 3780.319
oh I'm not a good care for where did I

3775.74 --> 3780.319
say that you [ __ ] disgusting liar

3785.88 --> 3790.6800000000003
you really think people are gonna buy

3787.859 --> 3794.5789999999997
into this blatant lie

3790.68 --> 3797.04
I mean you might buy into your own lie

3794.579 --> 3798.6600000000003
because hey maybe you were wrong and you

3797.04 --> 3800.04
don't really want to be a concaver

3798.66 --> 3803.22
anymore

3800.04 --> 3807.38
yeah I get that but it doesn't work on

3803.22 --> 3809.2799999999997
us because we saw you say all that

3807.38 --> 3812.7200000000003
loudly

3809.28 --> 3812.7200000000003
huh liar

3826.16 --> 3832.44
funny yeah and you're a gamma gamma [ __ ]

3829.14 --> 3836.42
with that's what you are George Sanford

3832.44 --> 3836.42
lying sniveling scumbag

3837.839 --> 3842.099
I should have kicked you out a long time

3839.46 --> 3844.68
ago because you were mostly just a

3842.099 --> 3846.78
Debbie Downer anyway

3844.68 --> 3848.3999999999996
I thought like oh well maybe I could

3846.78 --> 3850.98
just keep it around for a bit of variety

3848.4 --> 3853.98
because I have some weird sympathies

3850.98 --> 3856.579
towards Debbie downers a little bit as I

3853.98 --> 3859.079
used to hang around Debbie downers a lot

3856.579 --> 3860.819
and I sometimes like the challenge and

3859.079 --> 3863.78
like trying to change their perspective

3860.819 --> 3866.579
from their gloominess to like something

3863.78 --> 3868.8590000000004
miraculously bright and it worked a lot

3866.579 --> 3870.299
of the times yeah so that's kind of why

3868.859 --> 3872.64
I kept you around because I thought I

3870.299 --> 3877.22
could like reawaken you but it turned

3872.64 --> 3877.22
out you were actually a gamma [ __ ]

3882.18 --> 3886.68
could you link this Source I will enjoy

3885.059 --> 3887.7000000000003
bashing a cocaine what are you talking

3886.68 --> 3889.44
about

3887.7 --> 3891.96
I don't know when that was it's like

3889.44 --> 3895.14
months ago or something

3891.96 --> 3898.4
I don't know by heart didn't put him in

3895.14 --> 3898.4
the in the title I think

3899.04 --> 3905.2799999999997
maybe if you look on the word concave

3903.299 --> 3909.02
there's a there's a chance that the word

3905.28 --> 3909.02
concave could be in the title

3909.119 --> 3915.299
but I didn't put George Stanford in the

3911.579 --> 3918.7400000000002
title that that would be a bit too far

3915.299 --> 3918.74
I would never do that

3923.819 --> 3928.319
like if I'm gonna like really go off on

3926.16 --> 3930.5589999999997
somebody I'm not gonna put their name in

3928.319 --> 3933.54
the title because it's not like I'm

3930.559 --> 3935.46
universally proud of going off on people

3933.54 --> 3937.319
even though they might deserve it it's

3935.46 --> 3938.579
not something I like to advertise if you

3937.319 --> 3941.04
know what I mean

3938.579 --> 3943.02
but yeah that did happen

3941.04 --> 3946.46
it was a while ago

3943.02 --> 3950.22
and George Sanford said and confirmed

3946.46 --> 3954.079
and backed up that he was a concaver

3950.22 --> 3954.0789999999997
and now he's lying about it

3960.82 --> 3967.46
[Music]

3963.619 --> 3967.46
hey virus

3972.119 --> 3979.2200000000003

4010.539 --> 4014.42
I'm afraid you're gonna have to find

4012.68 --> 4017.24
that show yourself I'm not gonna look

4014.42 --> 4019.64
for it I'm not that interested I just

4017.24 --> 4022.18
know that's what happened that's how I

4019.64 --> 4024.92
remember the last time

4022.18 --> 4028.0389999999998
it was a while ago that was all before

4024.92 --> 4031.099
boulder dash and everything

4028.039 --> 4035.44
I think that was even before

4031.099 --> 4035.44
before reichi went weird

4036.859 --> 4042.98
so it is a while ago

4039.14 --> 4046.9
it was a special Arthur

4042.98 --> 4046.9
yeah very special all right

4056.18 --> 4062.319
special boy Arthur

4058.52 --> 4062.319

4121.52 --> 4123.9400000000005
turret

4124.46 --> 4129.1

4169.699 --> 4175.5199999999995
well although teaching I mean it's only

4173.48 --> 4176.9
really teaching when they actually learn

4175.52 --> 4179.4800000000005
it

4176.9 --> 4181.04
but we learn a lot about how to try and

4179.48 --> 4183.44
teach ballers

4181.04 --> 4186.16
and how they think how they try to avoid

4183.44 --> 4186.16
reasoning

4195.8 --> 4198.219
hmm

4201.199 --> 4205.219
I've learned so much about the healers

4203.36 --> 4208.299999999999
and yes Bill Nye the science tonight

4205.219 --> 4212.12
yeah totally calling it there yeah

4208.3 --> 4214.400000000001
I mean thanks to flat earthers Ballers

4212.12 --> 4217.04
had to actually look into the nonsense

4214.4 --> 4219.44
that they believe in

4217.04 --> 4221.78
and then deal with it deal with how

4219.44 --> 4224.239
[ __ ] stupid it is

4221.78 --> 4226.099999999999
before flat earthers they just thought

4224.239 --> 4227.839999999999
they were always on the winning side and

4226.1 --> 4230.179
they didn't know how [ __ ] stupid it

4227.84 --> 4232.9400000000005
was we forced them to look into their

4230.179 --> 4235.34
own [ __ ] beliefs

4232.94 --> 4239.199
we did

4235.34 --> 4239.1990000000005
and it was very entertaining

4241.76 --> 4246.1990000000005
I find it very entertaining

4244.52 --> 4248.900000000001
especially when the baller is kind of

4246.199 --> 4251.12
being an ass to just tell them how

4248.9 --> 4253.78
[ __ ] dumb the thing is that they have

4251.12 --> 4253.78
to believe in

4254.36 --> 4257.739
watch them squirm

4259.76 --> 4263.96
it's like they squirm because they don't

4261.92 --> 4267.28
want to recognize that you are their

4263.96 --> 4267.28
intellectual master

4267.679 --> 4274.3
they don't want to recognize that but

4270.02 --> 4274.3
they didn't feel it oh they feel it

4274.699 --> 4280.28
yeah because

4277.219 --> 4283.42
you have to be a flat earther to truly

4280.28 --> 4283.42
understand the globe

4283.94 --> 4290.178999999999
because you'd have to be a flat earther

4286.219 --> 4292.52
to design the globe

4290.179 --> 4294.92
because the globe's based on a flat

4292.52 --> 4296.06
plane if you want to be a real designer

4294.92 --> 4298.52
you're going to have to use real

4296.06 --> 4301.820000000001
standards real parameters the Earth is

4298.52 --> 4304.159000000001
flat so to have designed the globe you

4301.82 --> 4306.92
must have been a flat earther

4304.159 --> 4309.44
and to understand the globe

4306.92 --> 4311.92
you have to probably be a flat earther

4309.44 --> 4311.919999999999
properly

4312.14 --> 4316.58
hey guns Nephron

4313.94 --> 4319.48
Robert B good to see you

4316.58 --> 4319.48
yeah I'm doing okay

4319.88 --> 4323.96
I've gotten some night Rhythm issues

4321.92 --> 4326.4800000000005
though

4323.96 --> 4328.219
that's why I keep starting my shows late

4326.48 --> 4329.599999999999
but yeah tomorrow I'll have an extra

4328.219 --> 4332.9800000000005
long show

4329.6 --> 4332.9800000000005
I can get up a bit later

4338.84 --> 4345.14
rumpus used to think a pendulum

4342.679 --> 4348.1990000000005
does an aid pattern

4345.14 --> 4349.280000000001
until Nathan and QE humiliate him about

4348.199 --> 4353.799999999999
it

4349.28 --> 4353.8
show 1287 huh

4354.26 --> 4358.0
man that's a long time ago

4360.86 --> 4365.92
I really miss the rumpus nonsense days

4366.44 --> 4368.739
foreign

4371.08 --> 4376.84
but I really miss that [ __ ] I it's

4374.42 --> 4376.84
just

4379.219 --> 4382.64
it's just the raw chemistry of it you

4381.679 --> 4385.34
know

4382.64 --> 4386.96
it does get things going it does get

4385.34 --> 4389.360000000001
things rolling

4386.96 --> 4392.719
when there's rumpus levels [ __ ]

4389.36 --> 4395.62
we're having we're dealing with

4392.719 --> 4395.62
and I miss that

4396.14 --> 4400.280000000001
and I I really miss him coming in and

4399.199 --> 4402.678999999999
saying

4400.28 --> 4406.94
this is utter utter utter utter utter

4402.679 --> 4409.36
nonsense I miss it I just miss it

4406.94 --> 4409.36
oh

4416.659 --> 4422.239
it would always give me a smile even

4418.76 --> 4426.1
when it was meant to be annoying

4422.239 --> 4426.099999999999
it just always made me smile

4426.26 --> 4428.92
giggle

4430.52 --> 4436.900000000001
by the way unlike with Brenda [ __ ]

4432.92 --> 4436.9
Brenda just annoys the [ __ ] out of me

4437.12 --> 4442.5199999999995
but rumpus I always thought it was so

4439.76 --> 4446.38
funny I just I don't know why

4442.52 --> 4446.38
it just makes me giggle

4456.08 --> 4461.78
oh by the way Sam good to see you

4459.199 --> 4463.879999999999
man I got plenty of people visiting me

4461.78 --> 4466.04
these days I'm very happy with all the

4463.88 --> 4468.32
new people that have subscribed and all

4466.04 --> 4470.9
people that have found their way back

4468.32 --> 4473.84
I've got some weird issues

4470.9 --> 4475.94
where a lot of people were just banned

4473.84 --> 4478.42
even though I don't remember Banning

4475.94 --> 4478.419999999999
them at all

4479.179 --> 4485.36
by the way that includes George Sanford

4482.54 --> 4487.94
did I ban him I could have it could be

4485.36 --> 4490.339999999999
that I actually did ban him though

4487.94 --> 4492.139999999999
because he was acting like a kind of an

4490.34 --> 4495.32
ass

4492.14 --> 4498.26
starting to use curse words and all that

4495.32 --> 4501.739
let's see has anything changed

4498.26 --> 4504.26
could have just been a wave

4501.739 --> 4507.08
also I did a

4504.26 --> 4509.84
Spybot Search and Destroy Check Yes they

4507.08 --> 4512.48
took really long too

4509.84 --> 4515.62
so there might have actually been some

4512.48 --> 4515.62
kind of thing crawling

4518.06 --> 4523.52
and then hopefully this weird [ __ ] stops

4523.58 --> 4528.46
yeah I'm not seeing anybody in there

4525.38 --> 4528.46
that shouldn't be in there

4538.9 --> 4542.44
yeah looking good

4560.84 --> 4563.9800000000005
trust a legend

4564.32 --> 4569.92
that's like an old baller why the hell

4567.199 --> 4569.919999999999
is he back

4569.96 --> 4574.34
I thought he was always kind of nice to

4572.0 --> 4576.5
me why the [ __ ] is he mad that's so

4574.34 --> 4580.28
weird

4576.5 --> 4582.679
anyway I'm just gonna check it and then

4580.28 --> 4584.3
and man people

4582.679 --> 4586.58
right

4584.3 --> 4589.1
and I do remember him being there though

4586.58 --> 4591.5199999999995
but I'm gonna I'm unbanning him now just

4589.1 --> 4591.52
to see

4591.98 --> 4595.82
and if he turns out to be acting like

4594.02 --> 4598.179
complete ass then I was just kick him

4595.82 --> 4598.179
out again

4598.88 --> 4601.36
right

4606.44 --> 4611.96
rump a spice up the shows yeah

4609.08 --> 4614.9
it also really makes Nathan foam at the

4611.96 --> 4617.3
mouth Nathan just really can't stand him

4614.9 --> 4621.4
I think he's just really freaking funny

4617.3 --> 4625.2300000000005
but Nathan just gets here

4621.4 --> 4631.959
he does not like ropas

4625.23 --> 4631.959
[Music]

4632.48 --> 4634.48
look

4644.06 --> 4647.4800000000005
what

4644.92 --> 4650.7390000000005
really turret

4647.48 --> 4650.739
when did that happen

4651.02 --> 4655.96
isn't that like in the beginning years

4653.179 --> 4655.96
ago or something

4665.0 --> 4669.46
it's returned lastly yeah yeah but QE is

4668.179 --> 4673.4800000000005
not having

4669.46 --> 4676.9
the Kiwi is not having romance either

4673.48 --> 4676.9
he's not gonna

4677.199 --> 4686.0199999999995
I mean if you think Nathan hates rumpus

4680.12 --> 4686.0199999999995
well Q is just like get away from me

4686.78 --> 4690.4
like not doing that

4692.719 --> 4697.58
I mean if I'd had rumpus on I don't

4695.06 --> 4699.1990000000005
think I'd last very long even though I

4697.58 --> 4701.3
wanted to

4699.199 --> 4704.419999999999
because I just think rumpus is funny but

4701.3 --> 4707.06
rumpus would probably just like get mean

4704.42 --> 4708.86
and dirty and until it just became

4707.06 --> 4710.38
Brenda level and then I'd have to kick

4708.86 --> 4713.96
him out

4710.38 --> 4716.2390000000005
like rumpus is not amused about

4713.96 --> 4718.9
me being amused about him

4716.239 --> 4718.9
I think

4720.679 --> 4724.9
I don't know what the hell he's up to

4722.36 --> 4724.9
these days

4730.04 --> 4732.219
foreign

4745.54 --> 4751.699
I don't know what's going on with George

4747.92 --> 4754.04
Sanford but the pattern seems is that I

4751.699 --> 4756.32
got to him one time where he said he was

4754.04 --> 4759.32
a special earther or something

4756.32 --> 4761.659
he's a concaver that's what I recognize

4759.32 --> 4764.12
and he's now like

4761.659 --> 4767.179
he's never really said no I'm not a

4764.12 --> 4769.34
concaver when I was saying that

4767.179 --> 4771.56
then he got really pissy apparently he's

4769.34 --> 4773.0
making negative videos about me or

4771.56 --> 4774.1990000000005
something I don't know I don't really

4773.0 --> 4777.26
check it out

4774.199 --> 4779.839999999999
it's just like bits of my video without

4777.26 --> 4781.76
any context weird

4779.84 --> 4784.28
and now he's and now he's coming back

4781.76 --> 4787.76
and say oh not concave

4784.28 --> 4790.94
local cave oh okay

4787.76 --> 4794.08
special earther then you're a special

4790.94 --> 4794.08
boy Arthur sure

4794.179 --> 4798.52
all right but he's just being a gamma

4800.45 --> 4803.599999999999
[Music]

4806.179 --> 4811.04
if if you didn't want me to call you

4808.34 --> 4814.219
come caver then you should have said

4811.04 --> 4816.86
that when it was happening you dumbass

4814.219 --> 4818.6
or send me a mail or something

4816.86 --> 4822.5
what do you think it's gonna solve

4818.6 --> 4824.96
anything now like a month later

4822.5 --> 4827.719
in my chat it's if you're lucky to even

4824.96 --> 4829.88
be and be able to be in my chat and now

4827.719 --> 4832.58
you're gonna tell me not concave why

4829.88 --> 4835.04
didn't you say that earlier

4832.58 --> 4838.0
why didn't you email me like hey I'm not

4835.04 --> 4838.0
a freaking concaver

4851.96 --> 4854.44
doctor

4858.32 --> 4862.58
I mean things you do have consequences

4860.6 --> 4865.1
you know

4862.58 --> 4867.739
you can't just undo the consequences by

4865.1 --> 4869.3
pretending that reality is different it

4867.739 --> 4871.4
doesn't work that way

4869.3 --> 4874.34
might work for yourself but it doesn't

4871.4 --> 4876.5599999999995
work for the rest of the world

4874.34 --> 4878.12
now that's usually the gamma issue is

4876.56 --> 4881.96
that gamma think that they can change

4878.12 --> 4885.0199999999995
reality and that reality will just adapt

4881.96 --> 4886.3
to how they see it yeah it doesn't

4885.02 --> 4888.679
foreign

4886.3 --> 4891.28
works with people that don't know you

4888.679 --> 4891.28
you see

4901.7 --> 4909.289
[Music]

4917.0 --> 4921.38
whole timer let him clear it up well hey

4919.219 --> 4924.02
he can clear it up all he likes but he

4921.38 --> 4927.26
seems to be more contentious saying no

4924.02 --> 4929.179
not a concave and making weird clips of

4927.26 --> 4931.04
my videos

4929.179 --> 4933.26
that don't really mean anything and put

4931.04 --> 4935.06
it on this channel I mean yeah that's

4933.26 --> 4937.159000000001
the way he's solving this issue if he

4935.06 --> 4941.38
actually wants to like rationally

4937.159 --> 4941.379999999999
communicate he can do that

4942.44 --> 4945.339999999999
but he's not

4954.26 --> 4959.900000000001
right so either you take a position and

4957.56 --> 4963.080000000001
he clarifies that position so like yeah

4959.9 --> 4967.46
flat earther glober come caver

4963.08 --> 4969.92
or like I don't know I'm an agnostic

4967.46 --> 4972.44
earther I don't know I don't even

4969.92 --> 4975.14
necessarily want to know

4972.44 --> 4976.759999999999
yeah if that's a special boy Earth or

4975.14 --> 4978.62
sorry special I'm gonna call it a

4976.76 --> 4980.4800000000005
special boy Arthur because you can't use

4978.62 --> 4982.46
the word special without me wanting to

4980.48 --> 4985.218999999999
put the word boy behind it it's too

4982.46 --> 4987.32
funny I did not do it

4985.219 --> 4989.4800000000005
if that's what a special boy Arthur is

4987.32 --> 4991.82
is like it's agnostic you don't know

4989.48 --> 4993.5199999999995
what it is and you don't really care

4991.82 --> 4997.099999999999
fine

4993.52 --> 4998.360000000001
then detail that and then we know your

4997.1 --> 5001.06
position

4998.36 --> 5003.759999999999
as soon as I actually know your position

5001.06 --> 5008.52
in detail George Sanford I'll stop

5003.76 --> 5008.52
calling you a concaver how about that

5011.08 --> 5016.5
and I'll just call you a special boy

5012.94 --> 5016.5
Arthur how about that

5021.699 --> 5027.239
or just an agnostic earther or something

5024.4 --> 5027.239
whatever man

5028.78 --> 5033.099999999999
although all of those things though are

5031.06 --> 5036.6990000000005
still kind of insulting in the face of

5033.1 --> 5040.120000000001
the overwhelming amount of empirical

5036.699 --> 5042.58
and geometric origin evidence

5040.12 --> 5045.76
concerning the actual nature of the

5042.58 --> 5047.5
earth that we're on yeah it's flat

5045.76 --> 5051.04
there's so much freaking evidence there

5047.5 --> 5053.32
is no logical reason to be agnostic

5051.04 --> 5055.42
about it at all

5053.32 --> 5057.699
yeah just because we don't know that

5055.42 --> 5060.28
complete confine

5057.699 --> 5061.659
doesn't mean that we don't know the

5060.28 --> 5064.3
nature

5061.659 --> 5065.86
the nature of what is around us what

5064.3 --> 5068.1990000000005
we're living in what we're standing on

5065.86 --> 5070.179
we know the geometry of it

5068.199 --> 5073.0
we know the nature of the physical

5070.179 --> 5076.179
material we know the nature of gas and

5073.0 --> 5079.8
gas pressure there's no reason
