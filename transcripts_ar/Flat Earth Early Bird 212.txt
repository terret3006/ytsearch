6.85 --> 36.92
[Music]

38.1 --> 45.699
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

42.01 --> 47.53
early-bird number 212 I'm your host

45.699 --> 49.36
Arwen and before we start the show

47.53 --> 51.82
please don't forget to share it on any

49.36 --> 53.8
platform you deem fit and also if you

51.82 --> 55.36
haven't already subscribed to my channel

53.8 --> 56.89
and hit the bell notification so you

55.36 --> 59.35
know when I'm going live which is

56.89 --> 64.839
normally 2:00 p.m. Amsterdam time every

59.35 --> 67.6
day so today the weather

64.839 --> 71.05
yeah it's rainy it's cloudy it just

67.6 --> 75.53899999999999
stopped raining for summary justjust now

71.05 --> 75.539
it's been pretty much gushing all day

75.81 --> 84.24000000000001
it's still dripping though it's a lot

78.61 --> 84.24
fresher and I even got my my heater on

85.92 --> 93.16
so yeah it happens I'm okay with it

90.39 --> 98.38
and today I got with me

93.16 --> 102.55
tumeric coffee and tea and that's it

98.38 --> 103.24
no edibles didn't go out today no in

102.55 --> 106.06
this weather

103.24 --> 108.399
of course it's raining on Wednesday

106.06 --> 111.25
because Wednesday is paper day so it's

108.399 --> 113.08
always very interesting every time it

111.25 --> 116.02
seems like on Wednesday if there's ain't

113.08 --> 118.78
going to be any type of rain it's always

116.02 --> 121.03
on Wednesday for some reason but still I

118.78 --> 124.78
do manage to keep dry in between there

121.03 --> 129.06
for some reason as well so I don't

124.78 --> 129.06
really mind much I'm getting used to it

132.93 --> 139.31
so yeah some of you might have taken

136.95 --> 143.099
note that I was on ran T flat Earth's

139.31 --> 147.84
hangout right before this well right

143.099 --> 151.29
before like ended pretty much roughly

147.84 --> 154.89000000000001
half an hour ago I think it was pretty

151.29 --> 160.56
good was ran T with Riley and then later

154.89 --> 162.17999999999998
Peter Van Leeuwen a chat regular then

160.56 --> 164.459
usually visits here I think he's

162.18 --> 166.92000000000002
probably a bit flustered now and just

164.459 --> 169.709
going out doing something else to get

166.92 --> 173.36999999999998
his mind of what just happened because

169.709 --> 177.359
he totally got pummeled very harshly I

173.37 --> 180.45000000000002
might add but deservedly so deserving

177.359 --> 182.93900000000002
Lisa and yeah he came on and then Nathan

180.45 --> 185.36999999999998
dropped in and then eventually I joined

182.939 --> 188.31
as well and me and Nathan just well

185.37 --> 191.28
Nathan was yeah doing Nathan level

188.31 --> 193.859
berating and I was merely just trying to

191.28 --> 195.87
get in between pointing out facts to

193.859 --> 199.31900000000002
help smoothen the actual structure of

195.87 --> 204.81
the conversation but yeah the guy just

199.319 --> 207.14999999999998
continued rum passing and degenerated in

204.81 --> 208.769
the quality of his output overall kept

207.15 --> 212.159
repeating himself it turned into a

208.769 --> 216.15
Brenda pretty much and starts to get

212.159 --> 219.32899999999998
vile and drag Nathan's kids into it and

216.15 --> 222.659
it just went totally out of control

219.329 --> 224.4
but it was still interesting because our

222.659 --> 227.519
main point that the entire conversation

224.4 --> 231.659
with him was surrounding was that he was

227.519 --> 232.5
assuming that the horizon is proof of

231.659 --> 237.0
curvature

232.5 --> 239.459
thus logically concluded he must

237.0 --> 243.629
conclude that the horizon is a geometric

239.459 --> 245.639
or aspect and what we were pointing out

243.629 --> 246.51
is that the horizon is a purely optical

245.639 --> 248.459
effect

246.51 --> 250.22899999999998
it's an apparent effect it doesn't have

248.459 --> 253.169
anything to do with physicality or

250.229 --> 256.47
geometry you can never approach it that

253.169 --> 260.579
kind of thing so there's no physicality

256.47 --> 262.94000000000005
about it that can that from which you

260.579 --> 265.11
can derive geometric all data

262.94 --> 266.4
geometrical conclusions that was mainly

265.11 --> 269.52000000000004
a point

266.4 --> 272.37
and we laid it out there in utter detail

269.52 --> 275.31
was it was quite glorious to be able to

272.37 --> 278.46
do that together with Nathan both doing

275.31 --> 282.78000000000003
that but yeah the guy didn't get it at

278.46 --> 288.78
all and he just started getting all them

282.78 --> 291.15
on the giggly and file yeah he just went

288.78 --> 294.29999999999995
nuts so yeah well worth it to check out

291.15 --> 297.419
Randy flat Earth's channel where it's

294.3 --> 301.08
streamed it was an interesting video if

297.419 --> 303.99
I may I might take a piece of it and

301.08 --> 307.5
then repost it on my channel if I may

303.99 --> 311.52
Randy I'm gonna do that right away maybe

307.5 --> 316.44
in the evening or something whenever

311.52 --> 318.71999999999997
you're okay with it yes I definitely did

316.44 --> 321.539
get across my points despite being

318.72 --> 323.72900000000004
interrupted and it was so hilarious

321.539 --> 326.49
because Nathan eventually left it just

323.729 --> 329.15999999999997
yeah he did everything he could and he

326.49 --> 332.789
was putting in so much energy that he

329.16 --> 335.639
got tired out so but yeah we definitely

332.789 --> 338.699
had a very powerful brutal victory there

335.639 --> 339.12
and yeah the only one not getting it was

338.699 --> 341.40000000000003
him

339.12 --> 343.979
or maybe he did get it and just refused

341.4 --> 346.26
to admit it but I eventually just

343.979 --> 348.659
started trolling and I had an

346.26 --> 351.599
afterthought and he then proceeded to

348.659 --> 357.11
rumpus quite unreasonably so so I sniped

351.599 --> 360.78
him out already gave him a warning and

357.11 --> 363.659
yeah that was that was interesting it

360.78 --> 367.42999999999995
kind of took a lot of energy out of me

363.659 --> 367.43
though it did wake me up but

371.93 --> 379.55
yeah I don't know how this this hangout

375.86 --> 386.69
is gonna be a reflection to being so

379.55 --> 389.47
active that early in the day but that

386.69 --> 392.24
was good to be side-by-side with Nathan

389.47 --> 397.85
without him basically having to wield

392.24 --> 400.639
authority over the Hangout because when

397.85 --> 403.40000000000003
it is in that mode he tends to

400.639 --> 405.47
constantly talk down to me bark down to

403.4 --> 408.85999999999996
me and he didn't do that here because

405.47 --> 413.21000000000004
yeah he was a panelist and it was quite

408.86 --> 417.83000000000004
enjoyable that way but still yeah I'm

413.21 --> 421.01
used to it so as long as he doesn't

417.83 --> 425.33
overdo it and he besides he almost

421.01 --> 427.28
always apologizes afterwards if he was

425.33 --> 429.38
kind of in the wrong so I I don't mind

427.28 --> 434.09
you know he's just a guy and he deals

429.38 --> 439.31
with a lot of tensions and I do poke

434.09 --> 445.94
sometimes at the wrong moment just yeah

439.31 --> 450.05
it happens a lot of stuff going on here

445.94 --> 455.63
in chat people I don't really know let's

450.05 --> 459.86
see who is here all right so Paige yeah

455.63 --> 462.919

see you all

535.77 --> 538.399
yeah

539.49 --> 544.7090000000001
yeah I don't know who this guy is

542.579 --> 548.54
lickety-split but you kind of sound like

544.709 --> 551.2489999999999
a troll to me making all these weird

548.54 --> 554.8389999999999
compliments sounds like you're trying to

551.249 --> 554.839
manipulate me but we'll see

559.57 --> 562.989
[Music]

574.35 --> 580.889
yellowish you well that yellowish you is

578.94 --> 584.0
probably due to this light right here

580.889 --> 584.0
and let me turn it off

591.65 --> 595.27
yeah see

595.62 --> 602.36
although yeah I don't know maybe I wait

598.8 --> 606.3499999999999
yeah it's also the light behind me I

602.36 --> 606.35
don't think I'm that yellowish

616.21 --> 624.4000000000001
but then again yeah there has been quite

618.85 --> 629.1700000000001
some Sun and my tan tends to be like a

624.4 --> 634.5699999999999
little bit yellow and red brown I don't

629.17 --> 638.4699999999999
know it's a special kind of tan color

634.57 --> 641.5300000000001
and I do have some Asian genetics in me

638.47 --> 643.39
some remnants of it so that would look

641.53 --> 651.64
yeah that would explain it

643.39 --> 654.01
I think yeah I'm not insecure about

651.64 --> 654.37
myself I'm just like oh is that really

654.01 --> 656.71
true

654.37 --> 659.23
I'm just being analytical here I don't

656.71 --> 662.8000000000001
mind look I look the way I look and I'm

659.23 --> 665.47
pretty secure that I am that I am

662.8 --> 669.6099999999999
healthy and that they're still running

665.47 --> 671.6800000000001
issues going and I mean yeah they seem

669.61 --> 674.89
to be mostly psychosomatic in nature

671.68 --> 680.2299999999999
they go away and some things just keep

674.89 --> 683.46
on staying no matter what I do and yeah

680.23 --> 687.64
it's just what it is I feel still very

683.46 --> 690.01
very healthy the only thing that I

687.64 --> 695.29
sometimes complain about towards myself

690.01 --> 698.05
is that I seem yeah it's basically my

695.29 --> 700.15
hesitant nature to engage in new things

698.05 --> 702.3399999999999
that's a bit of a problem that's always

700.15 --> 705.64
been a bit of a problem and that causes

702.34 --> 710.38
me to basically engage unless mostly

705.64 --> 712.6899999999999
physical activity and I do like physical

710.38 --> 714.85
activity but it's very hard for me to

712.69 --> 716.8900000000001
yeah I really have to have some kind of

714.85 --> 720.52
reason to go and do something physical

716.89 --> 722.41
or it's gonna feel weird I tried that it

720.52 --> 725.8
doesn't really work out well I feel

722.41 --> 729.28
really insecure where when I do that for

725.8 --> 731.3499999999999
some reason unless there would be

729.28 --> 734.26
somebody else I guess to do that with

731.35 --> 736.1800000000001
and then it is kind of purpose-driven

734.26 --> 740.83
because you're doing something else at

736.18 --> 744.8199999999999
the same time I don't know it I don't

740.83 --> 746.69
know I guess that the way my social

744.82 --> 755.6
dealings work is

746.69 --> 761.87
a little honey same hold on I got a

755.6 --> 765.44
Google this way yeah oh I know it

761.87 --> 770.65
conditional it's weird it just seems to

765.44 --> 776.3000000000001
work in a certain way and then it I yeah

770.65 --> 778.43
yes that is a bow behind me breaking the

776.3 --> 781.3399999999999
comfort zone yeah that the breaking the

778.43 --> 786.1999999999999
comfort zone is a bit of an issue but if

781.34 --> 790.01
I have a like a real good purpose with a

786.2 --> 793.07
good outlook then the confidence

790.01 --> 796.55
basically makes it very easy to to break

793.07 --> 798.74
that comfort zone it's usually the the

796.55 --> 802.91
lack of Outlook that prevents me from

798.74 --> 807.26
doing it to just keep the flow going as

802.91 --> 809.4499999999999
it is but yeah I have been breaking

807.26 --> 814.37
comfort zones here and there and I've

809.45 --> 815.72
like overcome for example I don't think

814.37 --> 817.25
I've talked about it too much because I

815.72 --> 820.34
think it's kind of awkward but I have

817.25 --> 825.38
this weird thing with with finances and

820.34 --> 827.72
like paper issues with finances like I

825.38 --> 830.0
have a distinct dislike and probably not

827.72 --> 832.61
the only one in the world but with me

830.0 --> 835.43
especially when I'm like financially in

832.61 --> 837.35
trouble or something that gets me very

835.43 --> 842.42
anxious and that makes it very hard for

837.35 --> 845.33
me to deal like dealing with calculating

842.42 --> 847.28
making just balance decisions concerning

845.33 --> 850.19
finances and that's like been a tough

847.28 --> 853.5799999999999
issue on me but I've learned to wield it

850.19 --> 856.0100000000001
a lot better over the course of the last

853.58 --> 858.86
four years because I had a lot of issues

856.01 --> 861.35
to deal with trying to find some kind of

858.86 --> 864.11
financial balance and was very anxious

861.35 --> 866.0600000000001
at the start like really seriously and I

864.11 --> 869.9
would sometimes even be shaking it

866.06 --> 873.0699999999999
sounds crazy but that's what insecurity

869.9 --> 876.5799999999999
feelings can do to me when it gets bad

873.07 --> 878.9000000000001
but yet I still have like these

876.58 --> 880.07
responses now every time something

878.9 --> 882.4399999999999
happens and

880.07 --> 884.21
even get sick from it just like I pretty

882.44 --> 887.1800000000001
much think I got sick as soon as I

884.21 --> 889.73
figured out that yeah the government was

887.18 --> 892.8499999999999
gonna withhold the entire Google money

889.73 --> 895.25
that I got that's like a major bummer

892.85 --> 897.08
and that has a response direct

895.25 --> 899.78
psychosomatically but I didn't let it

897.08 --> 901.46
panic me and I'm kind of proud of that

899.78 --> 902.72
because you know like if something like

901.46 --> 904.49
this would have happened three years ago

902.72 --> 907.88
oh yeah I would have panicked I would

904.49 --> 909.59
have become pretty damn depressed quite

907.88 --> 913.1899999999999
rapidly and it didn't happen this time

909.59 --> 916.6700000000001
so I am making progress at something at

913.19 --> 919.3100000000001
least and hey it's really useful if

916.67 --> 923.05
you're gonna be a guy that's not like a

919.31 --> 926.2099999999999
worker bee naturally but more like

923.05 --> 929.3599999999999
capable of doing their own projects to

926.21 --> 931.73
be able to wield finances because if I

929.36 --> 933.74
properly can wield it without panicking

931.73 --> 938.63
every damn time something goes wrong

933.74 --> 942.35
then I can actually find confidence in

938.63 --> 947.63
that and potentially be able to to

942.35 --> 950.27
really become a to get to make a company

947.63 --> 952.82
and to really get something going and

950.27 --> 957.77
uphold it I need that confidence so it's

952.82 --> 960.11
getting there slowly way too slowly for

957.77 --> 962.18
my liking like I'm already too old it's

960.11 --> 963.89
feels like every sometimes I get in

962.18 --> 967.1899999999999
these moods where I'm just like what the

963.89 --> 969.68
hell dude you're 39 you should have

967.19 --> 971.5100000000001
learned this [ __ ] 10 years ago why

969.68 --> 973.9399999999999
didn't you do that and then I'm like

971.51 --> 976.79
almost live ready to lash out against my

973.94 --> 978.71
early self and then I look like what I

976.79 --> 982.49
was there actually doing there oh yeah

978.71 --> 985.5500000000001
right there was no way I had the room in

982.49 --> 987.89
my mind to to even entertain that I was

985.55 --> 992.63
so focused back then on digging in the

987.89 --> 996.08
energies and that is what I was doing

992.63 --> 999.53
and it well didn't really help me

996.08 --> 1003.13
societally but it did give me certain

999.53 --> 1005.86
skills and insights or rather laid

1003.13 --> 1008.89
the early foundations for what is

1005.86 --> 1011.29
blooming up now so it wasn't all for

1008.89 --> 1013.55
nothing and that is how I basically then

1011.29 --> 1018.029
justify it

1013.55 --> 1020.49
and then just hope that it'll eventually

1018.029 --> 1022.4399999999999
completely be worth it all that I'll

1020.49 --> 1025.709
still reap the fruits from it and not

1022.44 --> 1028.5
just have a barren wasteland because

1025.709 --> 1030.449
that is if that was a constant fear

1028.5 --> 1033.059
pretty much that I was suppressing at

1030.449 --> 1035.76
the time that that would be the result a

1033.059 --> 1040.23
lot of people even like bullied me with

1035.76 --> 1041.49
that with that thought and they would

1040.23 --> 1044.819
just say yeah you're just throwing

1041.49 --> 1046.47
everything away it was terrible and I

1044.819 --> 1049.3999999999999
had to like bite through that ignore

1046.47 --> 1056.15
that because I really was aiming on

1049.4 --> 1057.5700000000002
achieving something unique so yeah very

1056.15 --> 1062.299
elaborate answer

1057.57 --> 1062.299
welcome to the early bird show hmm

1066.62 --> 1069.79
[Music]

1072.97 --> 1076.82
all right responses wasn't even actually

1076.4 --> 1083.75
an answer

1076.82 --> 1088.0
break your comfort zone yeah I do it I

1083.75 --> 1091.15
know it's absolutely necessary but I I

1088.0 --> 1095.809
figured out that if you're gonna just

1091.15 --> 1097.64
like totally jump out there and dig your

1095.809 --> 1101.29
way through constantly breaking your

1097.64 --> 1105.14
comfort zone you know what that does it

1101.29 --> 1108.17
winds you up it winds me up makes you so

1105.14 --> 1112.73
nervous that you eventually like lose

1108.17 --> 1115.52
sight of certain you lose track of

1112.73 --> 1117.83
certain senses you get overwhelmed and

1115.52 --> 1120.08
then if you continue to operate because

1117.83 --> 1122.78
you refuse to stop you want to keep on

1120.08 --> 1126.86
digging and then you can get in serious

1122.78 --> 1128.78
trouble and make very hard mistakes and

1126.86 --> 1134.8
have huge backlashes I've seen it happen

1128.78 --> 1138.08
and I've underwent that almost like but

1134.8 --> 1141.79
then pretty much realized on the way

1138.08 --> 1141.79
like wait this is getting out of control

1143.41 --> 1149.42
too many stacked risks and you lose like

1146.87 --> 1154.1299999999999
the threads lose their cohesion it's not

1149.42 --> 1157.19
it destabilizes so yeah it all depends

1154.13 --> 1158.96
on time and it's weird like I'm starting

1157.19 --> 1164.3600000000001
to figure out even more more like even a

1158.96 --> 1167.14
company if you want it to be solid you

1164.36 --> 1170.7199999999998
have to slowly build it up and get

1167.14 --> 1172.76
gradually get to know people that will

1170.72 --> 1174.44
want to become part of it but you got to

1172.76 --> 1177.92
know them if you don't take it slow if

1174.44 --> 1182.66
you just take in big companies and like

1177.92 --> 1187.309
structurally make it function then it

1182.66 --> 1189.2
diffuses the separated groups which have

1187.309 --> 1191.09
been built up for over time and a

1189.2 --> 1194.23
functioning will start to try to do

1191.09 --> 1197.36
their own things push their own agendas

1194.23 --> 1203.6
so I'm I'm thinking about this [ __ ] a

1197.36 --> 1206.57
lot it's like yeah technically I am it's

1203.6 --> 1208.279
weird like distantly as a dreamer I am

1206.57 --> 1212.33
kind of ambitious I would like to have

1208.279 --> 1216.529
like big things but I also realized that

1212.33 --> 1218.6589999999999
doing that requires a lot of insight and

1216.529 --> 1221.149
it's much harder than it just seems on

1218.659 --> 1223.8200000000002
the surface to really get it done you

1221.149 --> 1227.5089999999998
have to have such deep insight and such

1223.82 --> 1229.1589999999999
a good feel for it and being able to see

1227.509 --> 1231.169
through people so well that you can

1229.159 --> 1234.71
literally just by certain elements

1231.169 --> 1236.539
predict their their responses to certain

1234.71 --> 1238.429
scenarios even though you've practically

1236.539 --> 1240.799
never seen that before you need to get

1238.429 --> 1245.75
that skill down so well in order to

1240.799 --> 1247.519
wield very large companies and I kind of

1245.75 --> 1251.12
want to do that but it's gonna take some

1247.519 --> 1255.08
time so in my mind I'm now imagining

1251.12 --> 1259.029
that I'd may reach that point like if

1255.08 --> 1263.809
I'm lucky I could do it like when I'm 60

1259.029 --> 1266.299
if I keep on pushing this vision that I

1263.809 --> 1268.129
want to do that if it will turn out to

1266.299 --> 1271.039
be worth it look if I figure out halfway

1268.129 --> 1273.07
like there is no way you can end up in

1271.039 --> 1275.69
viable ground even with all the skills

1273.07 --> 1277.879
because you will be like forced

1275.69 --> 1279.1390000000001
abandoned certain principles so that

1277.879 --> 1282.799
kind of [ __ ] because there's no other

1279.139 --> 1287.36
way then I might reconsider I hope I

1282.799 --> 1292.58
won't have to but it's a slow process to

1287.36 --> 1295.34
really become that master wielder of a

1292.58 --> 1298.58
big company that it isn't just

1295.34 --> 1302.9499999999998
completely corrupted it's very tough so

1298.58 --> 1305.299
I think about that you have to start out

1302.95 --> 1307.49
take it serious already attempted

1305.299 --> 1311.12
starting up a company as a goldsmith

1307.49 --> 1315.019
one-man company and I was too focused on

1311.12 --> 1317.12
the craft and the art and I just didn't

1315.019 --> 1318.769
have interest for the company aspect of

1317.12 --> 1320.779
it and because of that it kind of failed

1318.769 --> 1327.049
though I still have the equipment never

1320.779 --> 1329.389
went bust I just gave up didn't I didn't

1327.049 --> 1333.35
want to do what was actually required in

1329.389 --> 1335.57
order to expand it I just wasn't into it

1333.35 --> 1338.33
and my mindset wasn't right but I did

1335.57 --> 1340.1299999999999
learn about that there are these things

1338.33 --> 1342.6799999999998
that are required I didn't

1340.13 --> 1345.1000000000001
think of before and nobody really gave

1342.68 --> 1347.48
me a good feel for it

1345.1 --> 1350.27
probably because I'd refused to listen

1347.48 --> 1353.27
because I deep down didn't want to know

1350.27 --> 1357.41
yet it was didn't have room for it but

1353.27 --> 1360.32
now I am and I'm slowly building up and

1357.41 --> 1362.24
next I I next time I am gonna try to get

1360.32 --> 1365.3899999999999
a real corporation thing going

1362.24 --> 1369.08
a one-man company of some kind

1365.39 --> 1371.72
I will damn well succeed at it like I

1369.08 --> 1375.4099999999999
would not try if I didn't have certainty

1371.72 --> 1377.93
that I could and would do that and if I

1375.41 --> 1380.63
would fail at it then it would have then

1377.93 --> 1383.69
I would have would have been a good

1380.63 --> 1385.5200000000002
reason that it wasn't viable but I would

1383.69 --> 1392.65
definitely have tried as long as I

1385.52 --> 1397.73
thought it would be so trust our

1392.65 --> 1399.77
corporation so what now look finances is

1397.73 --> 1404.09
another matter entirely look I've

1399.77 --> 1405.62
already been looking and dabbling in

1404.09 --> 1410.6299999999999
that kind of thing for a while because

1405.62 --> 1412.4599999999998
it's very much fits my one-man profile

1410.63 --> 1414.5600000000002
it's very easy to just do that as one

1412.46 --> 1418.64
man in this age so yeah like a

1414.56 --> 1423.49
cryptocurrency I have my GTI company

1418.64 --> 1426.95
that I'm still part of technically and

1423.49 --> 1428.84
so the finances will be easier I'm not

1426.95 --> 1430.88
going to be as dependent directly on

1428.84 --> 1433.37
bankers as a lot of corporations will

1430.88 --> 1435.8000000000002
have to be and that will make more

1433.37 --> 1438.8899999999999
self-sufficient hopefully that's one of

1435.8 --> 1441.62
the hopes that I do have and I don't

1438.89 --> 1444.47
know that's a matter of time and wisdom

1441.62 --> 1446.36
and not getting crazy and just a little

1444.47 --> 1447.8600000000001
oh I'm rich and then throwing away a

1446.36 --> 1449.75
huge amount of money and then either

1447.86 --> 1452.06
being mistaken or getting a huge

1449.75 --> 1454.99
downturn and after that [ __ ] prevent

1452.06 --> 1454.99
that at all cost

1460.33 --> 1470.08
so I'm getting there

1465.39 --> 1473.3200000000002
so I hope bringing this across dust

1470.08 --> 1479.71
really kind of proved that it is I'm

1473.32 --> 1483.37
taking this quite seriously and I guess

1479.71 --> 1485.65
it's it's built its structure at all the

1483.37 --> 1487.75
plan also in a way as a perfectionist

1485.65 --> 1491.01
it's almost like how I learned to speak

1487.75 --> 1495.55
I was following conversations in detail

1491.01 --> 1498.28
when I was a very little kid and I would

1495.55 --> 1501.07
yeah intuitively get what they were

1498.28 --> 1503.35
talking about very quickly because my

1501.07 --> 1505.72
mind would just tuned in on theirs and

1503.35 --> 1508.03
adapt and I would just get it even

1505.72 --> 1509.71
though it I didn't even officially learn

1508.03 --> 1515.47
anything about I would just start to get

1509.71 --> 1517.06
it I've still yeah like I would

1515.47 --> 1519.28
definitely understand when they were

1517.06 --> 1522.6399999999999
talking about relationship issues for

1519.28 --> 1524.77
example or about work technical I would

1522.64 --> 1527.0500000000002
differently be able to differentiate it

1524.77 --> 1529.24
because of the energies that were much

1527.05 --> 1532.57
clearer to me than the actual technical

1529.24 --> 1538.09
content and it would figure it out very

1532.57 --> 1540.76
young but then the speaking I did kind

1538.09 --> 1542.98
of like in secret it's almost like ooh

1540.76 --> 1544.42
nobody's listening kind of like some

1542.98 --> 1546.88
people have with singing they're very

1544.42 --> 1549.52
Sheree but I would like tried is like

1546.88 --> 1553.0
can I say this word

1549.52 --> 1554.68
right this sounded stupid but it was

1553.0 --> 1559.78
technically correct and then we like

1554.68 --> 1562.26
okay and later I would be like yeah this

1559.78 --> 1566.83
is the time I would be in in between

1562.26 --> 1568.69
adults I was like six I did speak before

1566.83 --> 1571.1499999999999
that but I really started like a

1568.69 --> 1574.27
conversation when I was six and I would

1571.15 --> 1576.91
just suddenly get into the conversation

1574.27 --> 1579.4
as an adult would typically join a

1576.91 --> 1584.53
conversation and everybody would be like

1579.4 --> 1587.8600000000001
whoa the kid can really talk and that's

1584.53 --> 1591.8799999999999
how I really started this up and because

1587.86 --> 1592.81
of that I am now rambling every day like

1591.88 --> 1595.8600000000001
this

1592.81 --> 1598.3
and that's the way I tend to do things I

1595.86 --> 1601.99
build up skill I train it but I'm very

1598.3 --> 1605.8799999999999
shy secretive about it because I want it

1601.99 --> 1613.0
to properly manifest because I don't

1605.88 --> 1615.49
want to look incompetent or like getting

1613.0 --> 1618.67
caught doing something incompetent and

1615.49 --> 1620.89
then not noticing it thinking that I've

1618.67 --> 1622.6000000000001
really accomplished something good while

1620.89 --> 1624.5500000000002
somebody that knows that skill can

1622.6 --> 1627.55
definitely judge that it wasn't that

1624.55 --> 1631.54
competent that kind of [ __ ] I I would be

1627.55 --> 1634.12
totally embarrassed so yeah but when it

1631.54 --> 1640.1499999999999
concerns basically cosmogony and the

1634.12 --> 1642.1899999999998
debates and everything yeah I am so

1640.15 --> 1645.3100000000002
confident about that she had really

1642.19 --> 1648.52
there is nothing anyone no troll no

1645.31 --> 1650.23
baller could do to basically break my

1648.52 --> 1652.6
consistency at it yeah you could

1650.23 --> 1655.93
basically fluster me you could make me

1652.6 --> 1660.1299999999999
so pissed off that I will lose cohesion

1655.93 --> 1664.0
and not verbal I'll put my verbals as

1660.13 --> 1667.8300000000002
well but as soon as I come down I'll get

1664.0 --> 1671.62
it right right away so there's no actual

1667.83 --> 1674.3799999999999
structural mistakes that I don't quickly

1671.62 --> 1676.6
realize and correct before other people

1674.38 --> 1678.46
as I have even taken out of it sometimes

1676.6 --> 1681.1
other people take not quickly but

1678.46 --> 1683.02
usually it's just me that just figures

1681.1 --> 1691.8
that out like wait I gotta say this

1683.02 --> 1695.91
slightly differently and I do so long

1691.8 --> 1695.9099999999999
long orange speech

1699.2 --> 1709.68
mm man that Tamara coffee so good every

1705.09 --> 1712.04
time I really like that I figured that

1709.68 --> 1712.04
we're not

1718.04 --> 1721.18
[Music]

1735.43 --> 1739.63
right yeah

1740.21 --> 1747.26
I'm pretty sure the earth is as good as

1742.46 --> 1752.66
flat and it's definitely not a ball the

1747.26 --> 1757.58
size of which the radius would be equal

1752.66 --> 1761.18
to the span of the equator because that

1757.58 --> 1763.79
doesn't geometrically work out with the

1761.18 --> 1767.66
actual physical measurements in the

1763.79 --> 1771.2
world it's only calculable like that if

1767.66 --> 1773.51
you presuppose it and it's not concave

1771.2 --> 1776.18
in the same fashion either because yeah

1773.51 --> 1779.45
the geometrical proof lacks for that in

1776.18 --> 1786.79
the same fashion you can presuppose

1779.45 --> 1789.79
whatever you like but yeah that's

1786.79 --> 1789.79
presupposition

1793.65 --> 1798.5900000000001
man oh it's raining again look at that

1799.82 --> 1802.82
Skoosh

1808.27 --> 1818.44
yeah hope it dries up in at least after

1815.71 --> 1821.25
two hours if it stops writing then it's

1818.44 --> 1821.25
all fine by me

1825.1 --> 1830.33
okay yeah hello Dave Johnson you have a

1828.619 --> 1834.559
question I see about the Sun and the

1830.33 --> 1837.11
moon how it stays afloat in the sky

1834.559 --> 1840.559
well the thing about floating and things

1837.11 --> 1845.4799999999998
being a flood is that they are basically

1840.559 --> 1848.869
confirmed to be physical and thus you

1845.48 --> 1851.179
first have to get some definitive proof

1848.869 --> 1853.4599999999998
that the Sun and the moon are actual

1851.179 --> 1857.3790000000001
physical objects are not just apparent

1853.46 --> 1862.3690000000001
light phenomena relating to the observer

1857.379 --> 1864.9189999999999
and once you have that proof then you

1862.369 --> 1868.97
can speculate about yeah what is keeping

1864.919 --> 1871.97
them up there when you actually have a

1868.97 --> 1877.19
something foundation to confirm that

1871.97 --> 1884.929
they are things up there instead of just

1877.19 --> 1890.3890000000001
visual phenomena and I don't buy it

1884.929 --> 1894.8890000000001
I look if there turned out to be some

1890.389 --> 1896.6
weird actual confirmation of physicality

1894.889 --> 1898.549
and I've already proposed how that would

1896.6 --> 1901.7489999999998
be doable like the approach actual

1898.549 --> 1905.98
approach and you you get an angular size

1901.749 --> 1910.009
change radically which proves approach

1905.98 --> 1912.08
or at least hints at approach it's not

1910.009 --> 1913.97
absolute confirmation of physical it

1912.08 --> 1915.9499999999998
will at least hints approach and that

1913.97 --> 1919.1000000000001
makes it more viable that it could be

1915.95 --> 1921.3790000000001
physical once that happens if that would

1919.1 --> 1924.619
at some point happen who knows I haven't

1921.379 --> 1928.1899999999998
seen it so far then I could start to

1924.619 --> 1933.529
figure out okay what is it keeping it in

1928.19 --> 1936.499
its position is it literally there or is

1933.529 --> 1938.84
there a position from which that light

1936.499 --> 1942.169
effect spawns and it's not literally a

1938.84 --> 1947.269
Sun up there what is keeping it there

1942.169 --> 1950.269
and well if it turns out to not be like

1947.269 --> 1952.46
beyond the dome or something emanating

1950.269 --> 1954.679
from some points and it is actually like

1952.46 --> 1956.21
something you could bump into or fly

1954.679 --> 1959.0900000000001
through and then get roasted or

1956.21 --> 1963.71
something whatever then you could read

1959.09 --> 1965.4499999999998
okay maybe potentially something could

1963.71 --> 1969.049
be keeping it up there like a magnetic

1965.45 --> 1971.99
reel of some kind and then you get a

1969.049 --> 1974.36
very very complex long-lasting task of

1971.99 --> 1976.279
trying to figure out how the present

1974.36 --> 1977.7489999999998
magnetics could be accomplishing that or

1976.279 --> 1979.37
whatever could be doing that and there's

1977.749 --> 1982.309
already flat earthers that basically

1979.37 --> 1985.279
have speculated widely into this

1982.309 --> 1989.509
direction combining electrostatics

1985.279 --> 1992.419
plasma works magnetics you know that's

1989.509 --> 1994.999
to try to figure out what could be

1992.419 --> 1997.99
keeping that physical Sun and Moon up

1994.999 --> 2003.8790000000001
their highly suspended within them

1997.99 --> 2006.669
within the presumed oh so that's it it's

2003.879 --> 2008.559
still pretty oppositional it still

2006.669 --> 2012.6000000000001
requires that proof of physicality that

2008.559 --> 2012.6
has yet to be found

2034.97 --> 2037.66
what

2042.83 --> 2045.73
okey

2050.02 --> 2057.129
well sure our miss okati you don't have

2054.669 --> 2060.04
to do that all in caps by the way I

2057.129 --> 2064.48
would prefer if you wouldn't but did he

2060.04 --> 2068.85
say that did Tesla like claim a

2064.48 --> 2072.31
firmament even as in as an absolute

2068.85 --> 2073.81
specific sized design or did he just

2072.31 --> 2076.44
conclude there has to be a barrier

2073.81 --> 2080.58
somewhere I don't know about this I

2076.44 --> 2085.629
don't know how far Tesla went in his

2080.58 --> 2088.06
conceptualization of it and did he even

2085.629 --> 2091.48
get into physical experiments with it or

2088.06 --> 2094.75
was it all deduction based like for

2091.48 --> 2097.86
example one deduction based piece of

2094.75 --> 2101.14
data would be the shape of rainbows

2097.86 --> 2103.27
suggesting that ooh there is some kind

2101.14 --> 2106.2999999999997
of lensing or reflection going on and

2103.27 --> 2108.69
because of the the arc shape of the

2106.3 --> 2112.3900000000003
rainbow that naturally arises one would

2108.69 --> 2117.19
use that it must be because of the dome

2112.39 --> 2121.47
shape affecting how the light effect

2117.19 --> 2123.94
manifests but that's still deduction

2121.47 --> 2125.83
still have to get some kind of physical

2123.94 --> 2128.35
confirmation as to the nature of the

2125.83 --> 2130.5099999999998
light to in order to confirm any of that

2128.35 --> 2134.1
so presuppositional again it's the same

2130.51 --> 2137.73
issue as with the heliocentrism except a

2134.1 --> 2137.73
little closer by

2154.3 --> 2161.26
rainbows are the real ones Jason that's

2158.51 --> 2161.26
ridiculous

2166.5 --> 2176.91
that's ridiculous Howard Massicotte how

2172.47 --> 2179.3399999999997
can you even say that like you no one

2176.91 --> 2182.0699999999997
said that's just weird like there is a

2179.34 --> 2183.84
doom dome really where is this mention

2182.07 --> 2187.7400000000002
of the dome because there's a mention of

2183.84 --> 2193.6800000000003
a firmament there's mention of

2187.74 --> 2199.9199999999996
separations but it's remains to me kind

2193.68 --> 2203.5499999999997
of unclear what that the dome supposedly

2199.92 --> 2206.07
really is this yeah the presupposed um

2203.55 --> 2209.2200000000003
because the only real actual clue that

2206.07 --> 2212.099
could even suggest the gem dome geometry

2209.22 --> 2216.5699999999997
are the references to tents tents

2212.099 --> 2219.4500000000003
sitting over which would require per

2216.57 --> 2221.369
default a certain type of geometry so

2219.45 --> 2229.14
that's more suggestive but that's still

2221.369 --> 2232.53
not super specific see so there are

2229.14 --> 2238.7999999999997
leads in the Bible but I have never

2232.53 --> 2243.96
really heard this definitive geometrical

2238.8 --> 2247.8590000000004
description of an actual dome and I've

2243.96 --> 2252.39
been digging this really like with Paula

2247.859 --> 2256.2799999999997
by the literalist other streams but

2252.39 --> 2259.3199999999997
mostly hers she's like very studied so

2256.28 --> 2262.099
and I think she kind of understands it

2259.32 --> 2262.099
in the same way

2264.84 --> 2271.15
but yeah that's just the issue with the

2267.52 --> 2275.2
mind of the human being we're so used to

2271.15 --> 2277.1800000000003
like we want to reach that end result so

2275.2 --> 2279.9399999999996
we then start to presuppose because

2277.18 --> 2283.0899999999997
we've been taught that that is the norm

2279.94 --> 2288.18
through heliocentrism which presupposes

2283.09 --> 2291.1000000000004
into infinity and that's normalized so

2288.18 --> 2294.7
it's much harder to when you let that go

2291.1 --> 2297.0699999999997
to stop that habit of always having to

2294.7 --> 2300.22
know the answer while you clearly still

2297.07 --> 2302.29
have steps before that to confirm even

2300.22 --> 2304.99
to be certain about anything and that's

2302.29 --> 2306.79
when the the hunger for pseudoscience to

2304.99 --> 2315.2799999999997
wonder off in presuppositional

2306.79 --> 2317.29
speculation takes over and then yeah if

2315.28 --> 2320.44
you're not careful then you might

2317.29 --> 2322.81
actually think that it's real that it's

2320.44 --> 2326.94
absolutely certain even though there are

2322.81 --> 2326.94
still presuppositions to be confirmed

2346.64 --> 2353.7599999999998
defending Flat Earth I don't need to

2350.31 --> 2356.84
defend Flat Earth and I just need to get

2353.76 --> 2360.8100000000004
rid of these freaking stalkers and these

2356.84 --> 2364.56
delusional religious idiots that keep on

2360.81 --> 2367.2599999999998
stalking us to defend against that up to

2364.56 --> 2369.66
a certain degree I don't have to defend

2367.26 --> 2372.0600000000004
my position of the earth being flat I

2369.66 --> 2375.1499999999996
just have my reasons and if people don't

2372.06 --> 2377.7
like that that's their problem they can

2375.15 --> 2379.53
try to convince me but I'm pretty damn

2377.7 --> 2381.8399999999997
certain there's no way that could

2379.53 --> 2384.9900000000002
technically even happen there's just no

2381.84 --> 2388.6800000000003
arguments there's no arguments that I

2384.99 --> 2390.62
haven't heard before it's only expansion

2388.68 --> 2391.7999999999997
upon old arguments that I've already

2390.62 --> 2393.6
yeah

2391.8 --> 2395.9300000000003
no it's [ __ ] that it could already

2393.6 --> 2399.06
discard it so always more

2395.93 --> 2401.6099999999997
presuppositional speculation upon on top

2399.06 --> 2405.32
of these previous presupposition of

2401.61 --> 2405.32
speculation that's what it always is

2411.46 --> 2421.13
too many explanations is it well there's

2418.579 --> 2423.8
a lot to clarify isn't there it's only

2421.13 --> 2428.329
the true oversight of things that can

2423.8 --> 2431.29
really help you figure out on on what to

2428.329 --> 2434.8100000000004
do on how to achieve something

2431.29 --> 2439.7599999999998
effectively and not misjudge where

2434.81 --> 2443.839
things are going you need to be able to

2439.76 --> 2446.2400000000002
explain everything the best proof of

2443.839 --> 2449.0499999999997
understanding something is being able to

2446.24 --> 2451.339
explain it to others and them

2449.05 --> 2454.9300000000003
understanding it and proving it by

2451.339 --> 2454.93
explaining it back

2467.54 --> 2475.55
now you want something that makes sense

2469.54 --> 2485.0299999999997
do you well what about what I said

2475.55 --> 2486.7400000000002
didn't make sense to you because yeah

2485.03 --> 2489.59
you're saying it doesn't make sense but

2486.74 --> 2490.97
maybe you mean you couldn't make sense

2489.59 --> 2498.7400000000002
out of it you didn't get it

2490.97 --> 2501.1699999999996
because I don't blame you I do dig in

2498.74 --> 2503.27
very complex things and the way I

2501.17 --> 2505.37
explain it basically demands

2503.27 --> 2507.91
understanding an oversight already to

2505.37 --> 2507.91
some degree

2528.47 --> 2535.2799999999997
right yeah I'd love to see your proof

2531.56 --> 2538.099
there Howard must Massey Cote it's

2535.28 --> 2542.1800000000003
really lovely it's a lot of claims it's

2538.099 --> 2544.75
really interesting but that's it's just

2542.18 --> 2544.75
claims

2560.309 --> 2563.309
sure

2566.619 --> 2571.119
all right so Howard Massey cut it that's

2569.319 --> 2573.7889999999998
an interesting color that's an

2571.119 --> 2577.089
interesting argument that is first

2573.789 --> 2580.2690000000002
coppered the presupposed design of the

2577.089 --> 2584.009
world there may be something to it but

2580.269 --> 2586.93
then again it may have just worked out

2584.009 --> 2588.88
based on that presupposition don't you

2586.93 --> 2592.1499999999996
think that might be a possibility and

2588.88 --> 2596.289
that it could turn out to be a little

2592.15 --> 2599.14
bit different out there because of

2596.289 --> 2602.2290000000003
things that he did not foresee for

2599.14 --> 2605.5589999999997
example even though it would logically

2602.229 --> 2608.2889999999998
match the structure of how he would

2605.559 --> 2612.4
approach it all as long as that's just

2608.289 --> 2613.2690000000002
missing data that nobody expects how can

2612.4 --> 2616.089
you be certain

2613.269 --> 2623.3799999999997
I don't think Tesla went up there to

2616.089 --> 2626.64
confirm it all but yeah his designs were

2623.38 --> 2626.6400000000003
definitely ingenious

2652.26 --> 2655.51
[Music]

2660.74 --> 2668.27
[Music]

2679.09 --> 2685.1200000000003
all right well thanks for stopping by

2681.49 --> 2690.7299999999996
Dave Johnson please don't forget to

2685.12 --> 2696.43
upload the video mmm yeah I still got 50

2690.73 --> 2698.41
more minutes to go just for

2696.43 --> 2700.3599999999997
clarification I'm not gonna have ran

2698.41 --> 2707.29
down I'm definitely not in a mood for

2700.36 --> 2707.92
that had enough baller idiocy for for

2707.29 --> 2712.68
half a day

2707.92 --> 2712.6800000000003
am I getting to more of it later on

2726.25 --> 2742.29
just yeah you are hello Lois runnin

2762.52 --> 2773.85
all right no Mike Chad is in chaos

2766.74 --> 2777.7799999999997
huh let's see oh I completely forgot I

2773.85 --> 2781.0
was gonna have mind-warped on

2777.78 --> 2817.03
maybe he'll still pick up I completely

2781.0 --> 2820.42
forgot I totally got wandered off and I

2817.03 --> 2824.0800000000004
had a pretty interesting video on his

2820.42 --> 2829.08
channel and he basically was filming the

2824.08 --> 2832.0299999999997
Sun with that and so a very persistent

2829.08 --> 2836.98
well I can only describe it as it's

2832.03 --> 2838.63
looking like a lens flare but not moving

2836.98 --> 2840.4
along with the camera it was just

2838.63 --> 2844.0
persistently beneath the certain of the

2840.4 --> 2846.9
set location and I was fascinating and I

2844.0 --> 2846.9
do wonder what that is

2854.01 --> 2864.15
yeah okay Howard messy cut that's

2859.2 --> 2866.66
alright I bet they'll love your NASA

2864.15 --> 2866.6600000000003
streams

2879.119 --> 2881.6600000000003
Wow

2885.97 --> 2897.62
all right so that's trying to feel the

2890.54 --> 2901.55
rest in see oh yeah hi I actually wrote

2897.62 --> 2905.33
something down from yesterday it barely

2901.55 --> 2909.26
got the attention that I wanted it to

2905.33 --> 2913.4
get but just as a piece of reasoning and

2909.26 --> 2920.7400000000002
it's concerning math and philosophy what

2913.4 --> 2920.7400000000002
does math and philosophy have within the

2920.86 --> 2925.6400000000003
what what's their relation with the

2923.54 --> 2928.22
physical and natural world and with

2925.64 --> 2932.12
science and I basically thought it out

2928.22 --> 2936.74
and it's like yeah both things math and

2932.12 --> 2942.4
philosophy and all these things they're

2936.74 --> 2946.49
all conceptual mechanics they're all

2942.4 --> 2950.9300000000003
mechanisms - um yeah to understand to

2946.49 --> 2954.56
oversee to help out with the structures

2950.93 --> 2960.7999999999997
of things but within the mind and then

2954.56 --> 2963.5
that is kind of like that is mirrored

2960.8 --> 2966.23
with reality hopefully like it coincides

2963.5 --> 2969.92
and then if it works out you go with

2966.23 --> 2972.38
that but it's basically yeah it's those

2969.92 --> 2976.64
are mechanisms conceptual mechanisms

2972.38 --> 2979.52
that really only apply to your mind to

2976.64 --> 2981.23
do how you visualize things that's where

2979.52 --> 2984.53
they function that's the only place they

2981.23 --> 2987.47
really function because in the world

2984.53 --> 2991.94
they are just concepts they are ethereal

2987.47 --> 2993.8599999999997
in nature they're just structures

2991.94 --> 2996.4900000000002
they're not the actual thing and that's

2993.86 --> 2996.4900000000002
the difference

2996.9 --> 3005.21
oh yeah thank you peanuts clerk yeah I

3000.579 --> 3007.009
indeed it was about time and I feel

3005.21 --> 3010.96
ready for it

3007.009 --> 3015.619
concerning the light particle issue and

3010.96 --> 3019.279
the presupposition extrapolations based

3015.619 --> 3022.849
upon um upon it within quantum mechanics

3019.279 --> 3025.279
and I'm still it at the beginning works

3022.849 --> 3026.9900000000002
but I I'm absolutely I'm certain of my

3025.279 --> 3029.749
case that I'm onto something because

3026.99 --> 3032.5089999999996
otherwise somebody would have just put

3029.749 --> 3034.819
that detail in my face and would be very

3032.509 --> 3037.97
clear and it hasn't hasn't happened

3034.819 --> 3039.499
because John even said oh yeah I even

3037.97 --> 3042.1699999999996
said like yeah just hand me those links

3039.499 --> 3044.2099999999996
and said okay this did you see that did

3042.17 --> 3048.65
you see that and like oh wait yeah I did

3044.21 --> 3050.839
see that it didn't prove anything it was

3048.65 --> 3053.9900000000002
just an explaining of mechanism it

3050.839 --> 3058.46
didn't address the actual issue of the

3053.99 --> 3061.4889999999996
light minimum quanta issue and how it is

3058.46 --> 3064.73
determined to be a indivisible particle

3061.489 --> 3068.98
it didn't address it and I haven't had

3064.73 --> 3074.15
an and address and a response an actual

3068.98 --> 3077.18
viable response to to it yet from John

3074.15 --> 3081.489
or anyone and that's just a telltale

3077.18 --> 3084.6189999999997
sign it's it reminds me a bit of the

3081.489 --> 3086.45
original story from mark Sargent about

3084.619 --> 3088.489
Flat Earth like yeah okay I'm going to

3086.45 --> 3094.989
debunk this I'm gonna debunk this I will

3088.489 --> 3097.5190000000002
find that proof that it's not true and

3094.989 --> 3102.17
this is kind of like the same thing I

3097.519 --> 3104.66
feel like yeah everybody claims this but

3102.17 --> 3107.569
there's no proof it so I'm gonna now

3104.66 --> 3109.91
structure out a new conceptualizations

3107.569 --> 3112.3089999999997
that seems to be possible within the

3109.91 --> 3114.95
reach within the limits of the data that

3112.309 --> 3119.989
I have available can be reasoned out can

3114.95 --> 3123.109
be structural eyes can fit and I'm just

3119.989 --> 3128.48
waiting for that for the proof that

3123.109 --> 3130.17
dispels my concept and reaffirms that

3128.48 --> 3135.42
light indeed is

3130.17 --> 3140.01
in in the physical energy quanta unit

3135.42 --> 3144.0
that does literally travel in speeds and

3140.01 --> 3148.349
is not just an instantaneous it yeah

3144.0 --> 3155.7
infinitely divisible beam manifestation

3148.349 --> 3159.0
as I presume it to be I'm already

3155.7 --> 3162.72
thinking out about scientific

3159.0 --> 3165.72
experiments but optical tests that

3162.72 --> 3168.6299999999997
basically would come closer to proving

3165.72 --> 3170.519
that and there's already issues even

3168.63 --> 3173.4900000000002
with the bare assumptions of light

3170.519 --> 3176.3689999999997
itself cause for example what they

3173.49 --> 3178.799
presume is that regular white light

3176.369 --> 3181.349
let's just say it's sunlight has all

3178.799 --> 3183.66
these different light frequencies within

3181.349 --> 3188.5190000000002
it right but light frequency are

3183.66 --> 3191.3999999999996
presumed to be dependent directly on the

3188.519 --> 3196.4399999999996
speed of the presupposed speed of that

3191.4 --> 3199.289
light so how can light basically just be

3196.44 --> 3203.359
white uniform everywhere and then at

3199.289 --> 3206.579
some point after fast presumed distances

3203.359 --> 3208.89
certainly hit a plasma and be refracted

3206.579 --> 3212.039
in those different speeds that doesn't

3208.89 --> 3217.2
make any damn sense all that light would

3212.039 --> 3220.88
not be arriving at the same time it just

3217.2 --> 3225.089
doesn't work light is pretty uniform

3220.88 --> 3226.859
there is no speed no actual proof to me

3225.089 --> 3229.049
that light is speed or can even

3226.859 --> 3231.5389999999998
technically be the Christian in speed

3229.049 --> 3235.349
it's frequency can be changed changing

3231.539 --> 3237.2690000000002
the spectrum of color and all that but I

3235.349 --> 3241.9100000000003
don't think that actually changes the

3237.269 --> 3241.91
literal speed of the light at all

3243.049 --> 3252.259
because I think that light speed is an

3246.869 --> 3252.259
assumption not based in empirical data

3260.55 --> 3265.6600000000003
yep and John seems to be putting his

3263.71 --> 3268.6
line in the sand concerning quantum

3265.66 --> 3272.83
mechanics and just says no I am this is

3268.6 --> 3275.47
bang he's using quantum mechanics as a

3272.83 --> 3278.02
body of science argument and says

3275.47 --> 3281.29
there's nothing to disprove this and I'm

3278.02 --> 3283.66
saying well that might not turn out to

3281.29 --> 3285.49
be the case quite so because I think

3283.66 --> 3288.7599999999998
there's a lot of presuppositions that

3285.49 --> 3291.85
are part of quantum mechanics that allow

3288.76 --> 3295.3500000000004
a lot of weird assumptions like for

3291.85 --> 3298.15
example particles being at the same or

3295.35 --> 3301.63
the same particle being at two places at

3298.15 --> 3304.09
the same time which any reasonable

3301.63 --> 3307.9900000000002
thinking person would know is a physical

3304.09 --> 3311.8
impossibility that's like a paradox and

3307.99 --> 3316.18
you'll find paradoxes in conceptual

3311.8 --> 3319.21
mechanics in math any philosophy could

3316.18 --> 3321.31
definitely find contradictions it's

3319.21 --> 3323.62
conceptual so it's a sign of

3321.31 --> 3326.08
conceptuality it's not a physical

3323.62 --> 3328.54
reality it's not a mystery mystery as to

3326.08 --> 3330.19
how can something that is impossible be

3328.54 --> 3333.04
possible all we have to figure it out

3330.19 --> 3336.3
mathematically no it's just a

3333.04 --> 3338.5299999999997
misconception don't you get it

3336.3 --> 3341.28
and that doesn't mean that there aren't

3338.53 --> 3344.38
these fascinating elements on which

3341.28 --> 3347.82
basically quantum mechanics arrived the

3344.38 --> 3351.01
weird effects like how does attention or

3347.82 --> 3353.6200000000003
knowledge which is kind of almost a

3351.01 --> 3356.59
concept on it's like an ethereal concept

3353.62 --> 3361.93
by itself how is that able to physically

3356.59 --> 3364.6000000000004
alter the result of a yeah of a of a

3361.93 --> 3366.58
phenomena like light how can it do that

3364.6 --> 3370.62
that is fascinating does it have to do

3366.58 --> 3372.61
with the particle nature of light and no

3370.62 --> 3375.7599999999998
nothing to do with it

3372.61 --> 3379.1800000000003
it's just a unique phenomena attention

3375.76 --> 3379.8700000000003
knowledge changes things now that's

3379.18 --> 3383.0699999999997
weird

3379.87 --> 3385.33
does it prove these particles being it's

3383.07 --> 3387.76
simultaneous places at same times all

3385.33 --> 3389.64
that no that's all just mathematical

3387.76 --> 3391.3500000000004
collector to me it's all

3389.64 --> 3395.31
presuppositional

3391.35 --> 3399.54
yeah microcosm ball [ __ ] so that's our

3395.31 --> 3400.98
wins explanation doesn't mean that yeah

3399.54 --> 3403.74
the double slit experiment isn't

3400.98 --> 3405.9900000000002
fascinating but yeah what's the

3403.74 --> 3408.1499999999996
independent variable two things at the

3405.99 --> 3413.18
same time or is it actually the

3408.15 --> 3419.64
attention altering the path of the light

3413.18 --> 3423.69
you know is that a physical thing can

3419.64 --> 3425.64
you prove to do that I don't know that's

3423.69 --> 3428.07
that gets really complicated because

3425.64 --> 3429.6
there's an ethereal aspect to it how do

3428.07 --> 3434.9700000000003
you know that somebody is actually

3429.6 --> 3437.7
paying attention you can deduce it you

3434.97 --> 3440.16
can interpret their stance but they

3437.7 --> 3441.4199999999996
could be just putting up a mask staring

3440.16 --> 3442.7999999999997
at something and in their mind they're

3441.42 --> 3445.83
staring at something completely

3442.8 --> 3449.79
different so how would you know you know

3445.83 --> 3454.14
what I mean no complications but yeah

3449.79 --> 3456.15
the effect stands it's there so yeah

3454.14 --> 3459.2999999999997
there's so much more to figure out about

3456.15 --> 3462.21
this world why can attention influence

3459.3 --> 3464.19
things so directly not through physical

3462.21 --> 3465.06
interaction but by attention now that's

3464.19 --> 3471.21
fascinating

3465.06 --> 3476.58
but those is proof bizarre micro

3471.21 --> 3479.2200000000003
mechanics no it only that thing is only

3476.58 --> 3482.31
based on the presupposition that the

3479.22 --> 3485.8199999999997
lights and electrons are physical units

3482.31 --> 3490.02
that have positions and that travel

3485.82 --> 3494.3900000000003
speeds and I have yet to see the

3490.02 --> 3494.39
definitive convincing proof of that

3501.59 --> 3506.48
all right so yeah glad to to round out

3504.53 --> 3509.6600000000003
the show with that putting that down I

3506.48 --> 3512.65
know it's gonna upheaval a lot of [ __ ]

3509.66 --> 3515.69
and John's gonna be pissed off I know it

3512.65 --> 3522.56
I'm not ready to get his yelling and

3515.69 --> 3525.92
[ __ ] over me I'm I'm not like I'll

3522.56 --> 3528.65
repeat all this but I'm basically just

3525.92 --> 3531.65
waiting for that that data that will

3528.65 --> 3535.76
actually literally address the issues

3531.65 --> 3541.73
that I am that I am addressing and I

3535.76 --> 3544.1200000000003
have yet to see that so yeah it's nice

3541.73 --> 3547.85
lots of discoveries bodies of

3544.12 --> 3551.0899999999997
information science deduction and models

3547.85 --> 3553.0699999999997
of how the presupposition would lead to

3551.09 --> 3555.98
how it would function that's really

3553.07 --> 3558.5800000000004
fascinating but I want the data that

3555.98 --> 3562.9
actually proves the foundational

3558.58 --> 3567.77
presumptions of the physical indivisible

3562.9 --> 3570.14
particle nature the unit nature of these

3567.77 --> 3575.27
elements on which it is being tested and

3570.14 --> 3576.71
that is electricity and like so with

3575.27 --> 3579.95
that I am gonna round out the show

3576.71 --> 3581.39
thanks everyone for coming if you liked

3579.95 --> 3583.64
the video please don't forget to upload

3581.39 --> 3584.7799999999997
it and if you haven't already subscribed

3583.64 --> 3586.2799999999997

3584.78 --> 3587.5400000000004
notification so you know when I'm going

3586.28 --> 3590.63
live which is normally 2:00 p.m.

3587.54 --> 3592.43
amsterdam time please also support my

3590.63 --> 3595.01
show through the super chat sometimes

3592.43 --> 3596.8399999999997
but even better would be through PayPal

3595.01 --> 3599.3500000000004
and of course there's the other projects

3596.84 --> 3603.32
that you can also sponsor my patreon and

3599.35 --> 3604.79
my GoFundMe project I will be back

3603.32 --> 3607.6400000000003
tomorrow with Flat Earth

3604.79 --> 3609.47
early-bird number 213 and I'm also gonna

3607.64 --> 3612.35
join the Flat Earth debates right now

3609.47 --> 3619.33
after this it already started up so

3612.35 --> 3619.33
until the next video keep it flat

3620.22 --> 3650.2889999999998
