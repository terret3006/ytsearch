storming really want to get some

60.219 --> 67.45
groceries and yeah it's almost the Gaels

64.409 --> 68.89
when they're so hard that you just if

67.45 --> 72.10000000000001
you don't watch out you could just get

68.89 --> 75.819
blown right onto the street and parked

72.1 --> 80.86
bikes or like falling over like dominos

75.819 --> 82.75
all over the place crazy winds but I

80.86 --> 89.14
made it and at least it's not wet so

82.75 --> 94.17
that's that's something so how you guys

89.14 --> 94.17
gals all doing see you should check

102.409 --> 108.22900000000001
1:01 rockhound AGM Jeffrey bailed John

106.1 --> 110.83999999999999
Watson Nathan Oakley 90-80

108.229 --> 116.079
Steve that one guy the plain truth

110.84 --> 116.07900000000001
Voynich and dudes good morning guys

119.59 --> 132.849
Steve didn't mention you yeah no the one

134.019 --> 142.239
so yesterday was interesting

143.42 --> 151.0
Mike was disappointing yep though yeah I

147.379 --> 153.79899999999998
still think Hydra dwells for ya

151.0 --> 156.739
letting me have a try at it but the

153.799 --> 162.459
sound yeah it was it was worse than this

156.739 --> 165.109
cheap-ass thing so oh well more chances

162.459 --> 169.099
will be coming as soon as I get the

165.109 --> 171.31900000000002
money back from returning me yeah the

169.099 --> 172.7
one that I had bought still waiting for

171.319 --> 182.98
that I don't know how long it's gonna

172.7 --> 182.98
take but it's what it is so

186.29 --> 195.07999999999998
so weird yesterday everything or the

191.87 --> 196.06900000000002
Patricia's hangout the preacher guy it

195.08 --> 203.45000000000002
was kind of interesting

196.069 --> 206.82999999999998
and oddly religious themed it's good and

203.45 --> 206.82999999999998
did feel kind of good

220.08 --> 231.96
I sound like your dad waiting for a gyro

227.64 --> 240.92999999999998
day what is that Johnson you're such a

231.96 --> 245.25
weird troll yeah that one guy beards not

240.93 --> 247.94
gonna work just my elfin genetics

245.25 --> 247.94
doesn't allow it

264.41 --> 269.57000000000005
right Jeffrey bill interesting concept

267.65 --> 273.5
saber-toothed tiger would have never

269.57 --> 281.21
been able to eat with those tusks what I

273.5 --> 283.13
think it's kind of a good point but it

281.21 --> 287.51
all depends on what they're actually

283.13 --> 290.21
gonna be eating I wonder like this is

287.51 --> 294.07
purely conceptual thinking okay so there

290.21 --> 298.82
they found decided to to take it Tigers

294.07 --> 302.3
Tigers yes saber-toothed Tigers with the

298.82 --> 308.03
long teeth of supposedly I don't know if

302.3 --> 311.89
that's real well who's to say that all

308.03 --> 315.22999999999996
of each species had those big teeth

311.89 --> 318.86
maybe it functioned almost like antlers

315.23 --> 322.64000000000004
and it just grew really large with the

318.86 --> 326.48
males or something then well like with a

322.64 --> 329.36
lot of feline species like for example

326.48 --> 331.79
the lines the females would be doing the

329.36 --> 334.52000000000004
hunting and then after its killed

331.79 --> 337.21000000000004
whatever they're gonna be targeting yeah

334.52 --> 341.21
there may be more maneuverability with

337.21 --> 345.77
with the male with the big tusks so yeah

341.21 --> 348.46999999999997
sure it could work but I don't know if

345.77 --> 350.85999999999996
there even was such a creature know what

348.47 --> 350.86
that is

362.24 --> 372.199
and just look at how so many species

364.819 --> 376.87
have teeth or horns that just turn into

372.199 --> 376.87
this place

380.22 --> 387.45000000000005
like a natural trophy that's and get you

383.94 --> 390.33
can get involved into mating habits that

387.45 --> 391.97999999999996
kind of thing so yeah who knows the

390.33 --> 395.96999999999997
tusks of the saber-tooth Tiger

391.98 --> 398.3
functioned in the same way I'm just

395.97 --> 398.3
terrorizing

402.97 --> 406.29
not sea lions

407.02 --> 409.5
maybe

410.66 --> 416.19
Smithsonian can get very creative when

413.46 --> 419.0
it comes to making up species combining

416.19 --> 419.0
bones and [Â __Â ]

422.75 --> 426.29
Sabretooth Wars

431.78 --> 434.53
so

435.04 --> 441.26000000000005
yeah

437.3 --> 441.26
and religious stuff

443.7 --> 452.57
I don't know it seemed to be the theme

445.2 --> 456.74
of the day also a slightly worrying

452.57 --> 456.74
thingy for me at least

461.09 --> 469.36999999999995
for two days now every time I watch

464.419 --> 471.46999999999997
Infowars on their own channel because

469.37 --> 473.0
yeah then they're not really present on

471.47 --> 477.08000000000004
YouTube anymore there are some people

473.0 --> 483.53
that are attempting to to interlink

477.08 --> 486.68
stream it and yeah I just go to their

483.53 --> 490.47999999999996
direct website thing but there seems to

486.68 --> 495.5
be a distortion now for two days and

490.48 --> 498.68
it's really aggravating so whenever I

495.5 --> 504.889
watch any of their live broadcasts on

498.68 --> 507.11
that page on their watch page yeah there

504.889 --> 511.82
seems to be some kind of interruptions

507.11 --> 514.789
in the stream it gets jittery gets not

511.82 --> 516.83
noisy although sometimes it's very much

514.789 --> 518.3
like it's being interrupted and

516.83 --> 523.07
sometimes yeah

518.3 --> 526.91
gets really jumbly like a bad Skype

523.07 --> 528.07
connection almost and I wonder where

526.91 --> 532.67
that's coming from

528.07 --> 535.339
it almost feels like it's been like the

532.67 --> 537.53
stream itself is being interfered with

535.339 --> 542.45
throughout the Internet so there may be

537.53 --> 546.62
some kind of digital attack going on in

542.45 --> 548.5300000000001
that sense in a way that I what they may

546.62 --> 550.82
have done this kind of thing before but

548.53 --> 554.03
they don't do it a lot

550.82 --> 555.83
they don't do it continually but yeah

554.03 --> 557.63
it's very disruptive because I can't

555.83 --> 562.25
watch their stream now without getting a

557.63 --> 564.4399999999999
headache after 50 minutes which is kind

562.25 --> 567.38
of tough all by itself just watching it

564.44 --> 570.9200000000001
just like it is because they're like

567.38 --> 573.459
overkill I'm trying to impress you with

570.92 --> 573.459
everything

573.86 --> 579.3000000000001
but yeah so they're being interrupted I

577.11 --> 582.9300000000001
think I don't I wonder who it is is that

579.3 --> 585.8389999999999
is that boob or is YouTube or the

582.93 --> 588.75
internet providers somebody messing with

585.839 --> 593.82
them through the CIA or whatever I don't

588.75 --> 599.88
know but it's not good it's never good

593.82 --> 602.0400000000001
to ya get things get disrupted getting

599.88 --> 606.66
banned from platforms is annoying as it

602.04 --> 611.48
is although very telling because you

606.66 --> 615.8389999999999
immediately recognize when company

611.48 --> 618.2090000000001
owners are bastards through yeah

615.839 --> 622.0500000000001
applying censorship and how do they do

618.209 --> 625.05
that and politically motivated and yeah

622.05 --> 627.3
it's very telling when they do it but

625.05 --> 629.6999999999999
yeah Alex always had his own stream in

627.3 --> 632.31
his own servers and everything and that

629.7 --> 634.98
just worked it worked really well but

632.31 --> 640.43
now with this interference yeah what the

634.98 --> 640.4300000000001
hell what you gonna do now

641.99 --> 646.66
Thank You Collin Turner for the super

644.57 --> 650.9200000000001
chat 2 pounds

646.66 --> 650.92
sort your his man

653.84 --> 656.84
bastok

660.62 --> 668.44
you know I can still ban you you know

664.78 --> 671.12
but yeah I can't sort anything right now

668.44 --> 673.5200000000001
concerning sound as long as I have this

671.12 --> 675.5
mic this is the way it's gonna sound for

673.52 --> 681.29
now until get a new one and I'm trying

675.5 --> 683.03
trust me but yeah I can't just just

681.29 --> 685.1899999999999
order a new one I don't have to finance

683.03 --> 689.72
your room to do that I'm still waiting

685.19 --> 692.2600000000001
for the other one to return my money so

689.72 --> 692.26
I can try again

693.6 --> 697.5500000000001
but it's probably gonna turn out to be

695.73 --> 700.5500000000001
somewhere at the end of the month

697.55 --> 700.55
unfortunately

713.23 --> 720.95
wait I think I think I know what's uh

718.42 --> 723.4399999999999
all right sorry guys yeah I had the

720.95 --> 725.1500000000001
volume still at about 200 percent it

723.44 --> 728.2700000000001
should be at 150 that's the better

725.15 --> 728.78
setting then you get less noise sorry

728.27 --> 733.37
about that

728.78 --> 735.52
forgot so I hope this is a little bit

733.37 --> 735.52
better

755.11 --> 761.76
right see Daniel are here before the

759.31 --> 764.55
superjet ask a question it's pretty good

761.76 --> 767.29
do you agree that science gifts cause

764.55 --> 768.6999999999999
causes without possibility of error

767.29 --> 772.99
meaning absolute certainty

768.7 --> 775.6600000000001
well no science doesn't give you

772.99 --> 779.769
anything it gives you a method to follow

775.66 --> 782.4399999999999
and the whole point is is that yeah if

779.769 --> 787.6
it works out every time then you found

782.44 --> 791.07
your cause and yeah if it doesn't then

787.6 --> 791.07
it's incorrect

793.75 --> 803.019
so no science gives no guarantees it's

797.35 --> 806.519
up to the scientists to actually confirm

803.019 --> 806.519
if it actually works

807.93 --> 817.42
it's just a method it's a really good

810.819 --> 821.7299999999999
method oh very reliable dan you want to

817.42 --> 821.7299999999999
come on sure why not

840.48 --> 849.0
I need to read up on the day and George

844.86 --> 851.36
if sky he's been saying a lot and I

849.0 --> 855.15
haven't been listening a lot because

851.36 --> 857.49
he's going through some serious inside

855.15 --> 859.9499999999999
revolutions and remember how that works

857.49 --> 864.98
but my mind is not really there as much

859.95 --> 864.98
as he is Hey

865.13 --> 868.76
here you go Dan

883.6 --> 897.4300000000001
well nice goin i doing that's all flight

892.94 --> 905.7800000000001
evidence this sir water's fine yeah

897.43 --> 908.0
that's nice yeah sideways awesome

905.78 --> 913.8199999999999
yeah it's chillin chillin by the pool

908.0 --> 920.93
link you lucky bastard those people in

913.82 --> 927.6500000000001
shots hey youtube how's the temperature

920.93 --> 935.15
there so out 22 degrees Celsius yeah

927.65 --> 944.6899999999999
nice no wind not really no yeah it's

935.15 --> 947.3199999999999
pretty good isn't that like really

944.69 --> 949.6700000000001
expensive to stay there how long

947.32 --> 951.44
actually it's not to you but when the

949.67 --> 952.91
school holidays of that it's like more

951.44 --> 958.82
expensive but when you just go outside

952.91 --> 961.73
of school holidays so watch even it's

958.82 --> 965.12
like 100 euros a night with flights as

961.73 --> 967.16
well with the flight included yeah whoa

965.12 --> 972.14
that's not bad at all

967.16 --> 975.9499999999999
that's really cheap what I guess it does

972.14 --> 981.83
help the tourist places keep on running

975.95 --> 983.96
outside of the tourist seasons yeah so

981.83 --> 985.7800000000001
everybody stays trained and everything

983.96 --> 993.1
it's pretty smart actually

985.78 --> 998.23
ah man ever swashy people swimming in

993.1 --> 1000.39
this pool first it's level how is the

998.23 --> 1004.32
water quality is it really high on

1000.39 --> 1005.85
chlorine or yeah it's pretty close I

1004.32 --> 1009.0600000000001
think it's a saltwater pool but it's

1005.85 --> 1011.46
resolved water sorry serious I think so

1009.06 --> 1014.5799999999999
yeah but I can't the salt water he's

1011.46 --> 1017.99
never like blue it's always like more

1014.58 --> 1020.9100000000001
green so what's four chemicals in it

1017.99 --> 1024.569
they must put chemicals in it as

1020.91 --> 1027.03
probably chlorine yeah I was taught to

1024.569 --> 1029.9389999999999
go and swim in the sea that's yeah

1027.03 --> 1031.189
what hearing a copters man you're so

1029.939 --> 1040.47
lucky

1031.189 --> 1047.3700000000001
yeah look at my weather where a look at

1040.47 --> 1050.6100000000001
the contrast people lucky Dan Winfield

1047.37 --> 1052.7399999999998
what did they do share my screen

1050.61 --> 1056.76
did they see mine as well yeah yeah

1052.74 --> 1060.6200000000001
we're splitting up Oh God yeah if you

1056.76 --> 1060.62
watch on the YouTube page you can see it

1062.09 --> 1068.25
can you simultaneously watching YouTube

1065.54 --> 1071.01
yeah I don't think cuz I'm on my phone I

1068.25 --> 1072.81
think I can switch between them okay

1071.01 --> 1078.54
why are you gonna watch it later but

1072.81 --> 1089.1
yeah it's quite a stark difference but

1078.54 --> 1092.19

like I've been to it like a tropical

1194.769 --> 1197.909
for anyone who wants to join

1222.33 --> 1227.6699999999998
it's fine truth seeker mafia says I

1225.42 --> 1231.69
never get why people go to the beach to

1227.67 --> 1233.76
swim in a pool well I think it has

1231.69 --> 1239.22
something to do with that pools are just

1233.76 --> 1241.68
so beautifully blue I'm serious I think

1239.22 --> 1244.28
that has a profound psychological effect

1241.68 --> 1244.28
on people

1251.68 --> 1254.25
yeah

1260.27 --> 1263.26
what

1264.9 --> 1272.7900000000002

1288.56 --> 1295.12
ever and I've drove a lot I even at some

1291.83 --> 1301.6399999999999
point considered to be a taxicab driver

1295.12 --> 1308.1699999999998
but then my I met my ex and I became

1301.64 --> 1310.7
full time boyfriend but no I've never

1308.17 --> 1315.89
caused an accident never been in an

1310.7 --> 1320.9
accident and very glad I see that [Â __Â ]

1315.89 --> 1322.97
coming like way ahead of time can feel

1320.9 --> 1325.91
it coming can feel it when something is

1322.97 --> 1330.56
in the air or when somebody is like it's

1325.91 --> 1333.38
been spiked been poised karmically

1330.56 --> 1336.62
poised you could say to cause something

1333.38 --> 1339.2
like that and yeah I don't get accidents

1336.62 --> 1341.7199999999998
like the worst I've ever happened is

1339.2 --> 1344.27
basically somebody goes on the break all

1341.72 --> 1346.94
of a sudden and I yeah I just bump into

1344.27 --> 1348.92
them slightly that sort of thing that's

1346.94 --> 1351.16
like the only thing that's ever went

1348.92 --> 1351.16
wrong

1352.41 --> 1359.5700000000002
never actually caused any real damage

1354.57 --> 1359.57
and yeah I'd like to keep it that way

1362.0 --> 1374.82
so no I did not drive my expensive car

1366.42 --> 1380.52
into a tree yeah it is instinct but it's

1374.82 --> 1383.81
also attention you know humans have a

1380.52 --> 1387.98
lot of skills driving is one of them and

1383.81 --> 1391.6799999999998
riding it's kind of the same route it's

1387.98 --> 1394.5
interacting with motioning things and we

1391.68 --> 1396.3600000000001
have instincts for this but you've got

1394.5 --> 1398.94
to give it your full attention you got

1396.36 --> 1404.6299999999999
to take it very seriously and eventually

1398.94 --> 1407.4
if you dedicate a substantial portion to

1404.63 --> 1409.8200000000002
yeah driving when you're doing it and

1407.4 --> 1413.49
not getting distracted by other [Â __Â ]

1409.82 --> 1415.95
then your instincts will eventually be

1413.49 --> 1418.53
able to take that over so you don't have

1415.95 --> 1420.69
to spend as much consciousness although

1418.53 --> 1422.8799999999999
you still have to pay that amount of

1420.69 --> 1426.5700000000002
energy in order for your instinct to do

1422.88 --> 1428.43
it properly and yeah if you just always

1426.57 --> 1431.4299999999998
do that and don't get distracted by your

1428.43 --> 1434.5800000000002
freaking Facebook [Â __Â ] or whatever

1431.43 --> 1437.55
all that or chatting people in the car

1434.58 --> 1440.8799999999999
then yes everything's gonna be all right

1437.55 --> 1442.74
and you can feel [Â __Â ] ahead you can feel

1440.88 --> 1445.65
it coming but you really have to be

1442.74 --> 1451.31
looking out there like a scout for for

1445.65 --> 1451.3100000000002
real that's it that's the trick

1453.0 --> 1460.85
and don't be intimidated also don't get

1458.61 --> 1460.85
nervous

1467.68 --> 1475.52
right yeah yeah Colin Turner it was a

1470.72 --> 1478.76
joke I know but and the pun was

1475.52 --> 1482.57
blatantly obvious but yeah I always take

1478.76 --> 1485.62
people's weird ass comments to it as an

1482.57 --> 1489.97
excuse to start talking about something

1485.62 --> 1489.9699999999998
you know me that's what I do

1501.22 --> 1507.98
and

1503.58 --> 1507.98
if you stray well

1508.69 --> 1519.3700000000001
straying is if you master driving like

1514.51 --> 1521.74
totally master it and I have yeah I know

1519.37 --> 1523.4799999999998
I have to prove that [Â __Â ] of course they

1521.74 --> 1528.1
who knows what's gonna happen one day

1523.48 --> 1531.88
like I wouldn't be I'm not like a race

1528.1 --> 1534.3999999999999
car material like high speeds super

1531.88 --> 1538.66
precision like on high pressure that's

1534.4 --> 1542.2900000000002
probably not me like maybe sometimes for

1538.66 --> 1545.17
fun of it but and yeah I'm not that kind

1542.29 --> 1547.84
of a guy not a guy who would step in a

1545.17 --> 1550.21
rocket Biscay but when it comes to just

1547.84 --> 1553.9299999999998
general driving skills and understanding

1550.21 --> 1558.31
how how it works yeah you can absolutely

1553.93 --> 1560.2
bend the rules but you got to do it in a

1558.31 --> 1563.8899999999999
way that it's not gonna disturb other

1560.2 --> 1566.17
people that's the whole point you got to

1563.89 --> 1569.47
make sure nobody gets shocked or

1566.17 --> 1572.77
confused in any way and then it actually

1569.47 --> 1575.65
doesn't really matter what you do as

1572.77 --> 1577.33
long as you absolutely understand

1575.65 --> 1581.98
everything that's going on around you

1577.33 --> 1584.77
where they are at by testing exactly

1581.98 --> 1587.74
like how how they move in the sound of

1584.77 --> 1590.74
the engine and just instinct and as long

1587.74 --> 1594.46
as you don't disturb the peace basically

1590.74 --> 1597.76
with your driving behavior or you don't

1594.46 --> 1601.77
get really distracting then it's all

1597.76 --> 1603.72
great nobody has a problem

1601.77 --> 1608.49
and yeah concentration and dedication

1603.72 --> 1610.23
like when I go on my bike and nowadays I

1608.49 --> 1611.7
have a bicycle it's basically the same

1610.23 --> 1613.26
thing but even easier

1611.7 --> 1616.92
except for you have to endure the

1613.26 --> 1619.74
freaking elements yeah but yeah it's

1616.92 --> 1622.65
more basic and you can spend a lot of

1619.74 --> 1623.97
energy and time on the surroundings and

1622.65 --> 1625.44
sizing you know it's kind of necessary

1623.97 --> 1628.95
because yeah on the bike you're

1625.44 --> 1632.3
vulnerable against cars and against

1628.95 --> 1632.3
idiots but

1632.37 --> 1637.37
yeah

1634.07 --> 1640.49
I I never get into trouble I see the

1637.37 --> 1643.52
[Â __Â ] coming sometimes I catch myself

1640.49 --> 1645.83
like oh I know I'm gonna have to stop

1643.52 --> 1647.54
like in 10 seconds because people are

1645.83 --> 1649.07
fooling around there and there's no way

1647.54 --> 1653.24
I'm gonna get past it that because I

1649.07 --> 1658.09
just see it instantly and yeah it's a

1653.24 --> 1658.09
skill and I think everyone can do that

1658.88 --> 1664.3100000000002
but also this instinct is driving

1662.0 --> 1666.62
instinct and then being able to bend the

1664.31 --> 1672.44
rules without disturbing people I think

1666.62 --> 1678.11
that is how these like Eastern some

1672.44 --> 1682.5800000000002
older eastern regions and Africa Africa

1678.11 --> 1686.24
Asia how these have just these maniacal

1682.58 --> 1687.9499999999998
traffic rules where everybody's like

1686.24 --> 1689.54
ants going right through each other it's

1687.95 --> 1692.06
like what the [Â __Â ] how did they do it

1689.54 --> 1694.58
well this instinct and the same

1692.06 --> 1698.21
principle just work with the flow with

1694.58 --> 1700.73
what is accepted get the game and be

1698.21 --> 1702.98
super precise be very dedicated in your

1700.73 --> 1705.2
energy and you can actually do that then

1702.98 --> 1709.09
it's possible you can get used to it

1705.2 --> 1709.0900000000001
it's amazing how that works

1710.32 --> 1720.86
yeah as a challenge I would almost want

1716.6 --> 1724.6399999999999
to try it out if I could do it go to

1720.86 --> 1726.8899999999999
like some country where they just don't

1724.64 --> 1730.25
criss cross through each other and just

1726.89 --> 1734.6000000000001
see you like go with a cab driver or

1730.25 --> 1736.79
whatever or a bicycle cab and just see

1734.6 --> 1739.61
how they do it just try to tune into it

1736.79 --> 1742.25
and just see like okay I think I get how

1739.61 --> 1744.83
this works how they see are they make

1742.25 --> 1746.48
their decisions and then try to emulate

1744.83 --> 1749.54
it like see if I can do it hope I don't

1746.48 --> 1751.56
get hit accident and yeah see if that

1749.54 --> 1753.3899999999999
works

1751.56 --> 1756.4199999999998
because I think I could probably learn

1753.39 --> 1760.38
how to do that if I needed to or I

1756.42 --> 1764.15
really wanted to mm-hmm but yeah driving

1760.38 --> 1764.15
instincts it's fascinating how it works

1764.8 --> 1770.05
for me to get there the biggest

1767.68 --> 1775.75
obstacles was always being nervous being

1770.05 --> 1777.94
scared of of causing confusion or doing

1775.75 --> 1780.13
yeah I breaking down at some point that

1777.94 --> 1783.31
[Â __Â ] that was always that was my biggest

1780.13 --> 1787.0600000000002
obstacle but when I was having driving

1783.31 --> 1788.74
lessons but yeah eventually my instinct

1787.06 --> 1792.55
caught on and just notice yeah I'm

1788.74 --> 1797.2
really good at this and that fear is

1792.55 --> 1800.02
completely useless it's it's not found

1797.2 --> 1803.17
it found it in reality those fear so I

1800.02 --> 1807.03
just let it go and yeah I'm not afraid

1803.17 --> 1807.03
of traffic at all like ever

1811.01 --> 1821.44
so yeah we ended up talking about

1814.07 --> 1821.4399999999998
driving transports

1836.32 --> 1838.9189999999999
yeah

1839.95 --> 1852.0900000000001
so yeah talk about brexit oh my god

1844.45 --> 1858.16
I remember brexit from five years ago

1852.09 --> 1861.01
and still in the going through some

1858.16 --> 1863.28
serious weird-ass [Â __Â ] now remember the

1861.01 --> 1867.16
days when Nigel Faraj

1863.28 --> 1868.99
getting to the Parliament and just

1867.16 --> 1872.26
started talking and really got this

1868.99 --> 1877.3
thing going awesome was so awesome he's

1872.26 --> 1882.76
so good at it yeah I wanted it to happen

1877.3 --> 1886.3
and then as time progressed more and

1882.76 --> 1889.75
more it seems like it's just not

1886.3 --> 1892.6299999999999
actually possible for reasons that I

1889.75 --> 1895.32
don't really get or it's rather yeah if

1892.63 --> 1898.75
they would from what I've officially

1895.32 --> 1902.49
feel of it it's like okay if they do it

1898.75 --> 1905.98
it's gonna basically break up everything

1902.49 --> 1911.23
without having the normal typical

1905.98 --> 1914.71
oversight in how to build with what

1911.23 --> 1917.47
comes out of that so it's like it's too

1914.71 --> 1919.33
dis stabilising basically if they did it

1917.47 --> 1920.92
that's why they're not really doing it

1919.33 --> 1923.1399999999999
and trying to constantly find a way

1920.92 --> 1927.13
around to prevent the destabilization

1923.14 --> 1929.74
and it's tragic because yeah that is

1927.13 --> 1933.0100000000002
what once it's basically trying to

1929.74 --> 1937.92
retract from the whole Europe Imperial

1933.01 --> 1937.92
ization that bizarre process

1938.26 --> 1946.34
but it's too dangerous

1941.51 --> 1950.899
like on the short run and that's I I

1946.34 --> 1955.37
don't know I don't know how how what's

1950.899 --> 1958.2199999999998
gonna happen with that really I maybe it

1955.37 --> 1961.549
just needs more time it sounds really

1958.22 --> 1965.24
weird like it needs more time to fester

1961.549 --> 1970.639
almost it sounds really disgusting like

1965.24 --> 1972.889
that but internally more things need to

1970.639 --> 1975.2299999999998
be rerouted in order for that to

1972.889 --> 1978.59
actually be a possibility

1975.23 --> 1983.1200000000001
and there's needs to be done a lot and

1978.59 --> 1985.4289999999999
there are opponents within that are

1983.12 --> 1988.9399999999998
count working against it there are just

1985.429 --> 1993.919
very much European Imperial so it's a

1988.94 --> 1996.23
super complicated process as usual but I

1993.919 --> 1999.26
think that with time it might still be a

1996.23 --> 2004.419
possibility somehow but yeah it all

1999.26 --> 2007.51
needs to be accounted for a real new set

2004.419 --> 2010.6000000000001
up plan for it that's gonna be pretty

2007.51 --> 2014.139
heavy and gonna create more confusion in

2010.6 --> 2015.9399999999998
the world stage that is still basically

2014.139 --> 2018.84
counting on that it's not going to

2015.94 --> 2018.8400000000001
happen probably

2020.03 --> 2033.05
huh so yeah that's my thing I'm the

2022.82 --> 2039.23
brexit what's brexit isn't even know but

2033.05 --> 2043.73
that's that's when it was initiated but

2039.23 --> 2046.27
way before them there was talks of it

2043.73 --> 2046.27
right

2051.74 --> 2056.4399999999996
that should be

2053.78 --> 2056.44
I think they'd

2057.87 --> 2066.169
came out in the an alternative media a

2060.81 --> 2066.169
little bit before that sink

2070.22 --> 2073.22
yeah

2076.99 --> 2083.3199999999997
all right okay well yeah I'm calling it

2080.919 --> 2085.54
the brexit because I regarded as one

2083.32 --> 2091.44
process something that came before and

2085.54 --> 2094.629
then made that happen was a yeah

2091.44 --> 2097.08
anti-imperial movement the libertarian

2094.629 --> 2097.08
driven

2102.04 --> 2109.38
so anyway yeah I am absolutely none

2105.04 --> 2112.63
expert so sorry to anyone out there that

2109.38 --> 2117.04
thinks I explained it completely wrong

2112.63 --> 2118.87
yeah I should look more into it but yeah

2117.04 --> 2120.67
I should more look more into a lot and

2118.87 --> 2126.16
there is just so freaking much

2120.67 --> 2129.42
information out there I'm ready to dig

2126.16 --> 2129.42
that deep

2129.97 --> 2137.77
but I have been following it through the

2132.91 --> 2140.74
media sort of keeping track trying to

2137.77 --> 2142.569
size up what's going on but not like

2140.74 --> 2145.6299999999997
really really digging into it although I

2142.569 --> 2150.88
have been following Tommy Robinson who

2145.63 --> 2154.4500000000003
is awesome and yeah from what I last

2150.88 --> 2157.06
heard he's been arrested again I think I

2154.45 --> 2162.04
mentioned that like two days ago but

2157.06 --> 2164.41
that was kind of typical it's the same

2162.04 --> 2166.859
court system it's like holy [Â __Â ] there's

2164.41 --> 2171.93
some real exposure going on in Britain

2166.859 --> 2175.39
BBC and their court system and it's

2171.93 --> 2177.46
they're like really exposing it so

2175.39 --> 2179.109
there's some serious [Â __Â ] going down

2177.46 --> 2181.829
there I think probably in the

2179.109 --> 2181.8289999999997
not-too-distant future

2189.32 --> 2196.82
right Toby Robinson is not racist and

2193.69 --> 2199.2200000000003
yeah you could call him Islamophobic

2196.82 --> 2202.52
that's right well that's not very

2199.22 --> 2206.02
strange that some people are

2202.52 --> 2206.02
Islamophobic okay

2211.39 --> 2221.2799999999997
and yeah in this case he is talking

2216.67 --> 2229.92
about situations where yeah these gangs

2221.28 --> 2232.51
do some dark [Â __Â ] from a yeah extremist

2229.92 --> 2235.03
Islamic position you could say although

2232.51 --> 2237.76
yeah look and then again there's like

2235.03 --> 2240.88
the majority of normal people in the

2237.76 --> 2243.28
rest of the world that are Muslim that

2240.88 --> 2245.73
say like these people are freakin

2243.28 --> 2248.6800000000003
criminals how dare they call themselves

2245.73 --> 2250.75
Muslim or they're just too scared to

2248.68 --> 2254.35
speak out against it but that's what it

2250.75 --> 2256.33
they're probably thinking or maybe

2254.35 --> 2259.89
they're just really superficial and

2256.33 --> 2263.47
politicized very easily I don't know but

2259.89 --> 2267.0099999999998
yeah there's some really dark [Â __Â ] going

2263.47 --> 2270.37
down there and Tommy Rosen has been

2267.01 --> 2275.26
dealing with that pretty head on he's a

2270.37 --> 2278.56
very brave guy okay and yeah if you

2275.26 --> 2282.3300000000004
would be Islamophobic to if you had seen

2278.56 --> 2282.33
everything that he's been through okay

2289.18 --> 2295.569
okay and he is not a freakin political

2293.109 --> 2299.7
genius or anything he's a smart guy

2295.569 --> 2304.48
though smart enough yes he has a certain

2299.7 --> 2307.299
sensibility to him and he has is growing

2304.48 --> 2308.799
like he is really trying to wisen up

2307.299 --> 2310.5389999999998
with everything he goes through he's

2308.799 --> 2312.97
really really learning I'm noticing this

2310.539 --> 2317.65
about it it's eased improving and that's

2312.97 --> 2320.41
very interesting to see but yeah he's

2317.65 --> 2323.77
not gonna be super careful

2320.41 --> 2327.49
look there's also the the public streams

2323.77 --> 2329.38
and not being PC and beings very

2327.49 --> 2332.9399999999996
straightforward and even over

2329.38 --> 2337.539
generalizing at that just comes with it

2332.94 --> 2341.2000000000003
it's yeah you can't get all social

2337.539 --> 2344.0200000000004
justice warrior safe or like the old

2341.2 --> 2346.45
form of that because now they're just

2344.02 --> 2349.69
going totally insane the social justice

2346.45 --> 2354.73
worries do crazy [Â __Â ] ever but it does

2349.69 --> 2357.4900000000002
you can't do that he has to stick to to

2354.73 --> 2361.299
how that works to the logos it's so

2357.49 --> 2364.6899999999996
freaky you know way it's just I don't

2361.299 --> 2369.73
know I think he's doing great and it was

2364.69 --> 2371.109
very impressed by panel drama if you

2369.73 --> 2375.69
haven't seen that you should look at it

2371.109 --> 2379.319
it was total exposure of BBC was really

2375.69 --> 2379.319
pretty hard hitting

2380.079 --> 2384.9590000000003
man I always been arrested again so yeah

2388.99 --> 2393.839
yep I guess it's time for free Tommy

2391.72 --> 2393.839
again

2400.02 --> 2403.88
and of course hashtag fever

2415.19 --> 2417.85
so

2423.11 --> 2427.54
Colin Turner stop being a dick

2429.56 --> 2434.95
all right Tommy Robinson is no freaking

2432.08 --> 2434.95
Hitler okay

2436.7 --> 2444.73
besides you probably don't even know who

2439.369 --> 2444.73
Hitler really was because

2445.46 --> 2453.14
that everything that happened back then

2447.74 --> 2455.66
is just there's been some games going on

2453.14 --> 2457.5499999999997
with how things are portrayed how things

2455.66 --> 2460.1299999999997
were decided history has been altered

2457.55 --> 2462.76
and the main a circus out of it and

2460.13 --> 2467.0
Hitler is the ultimate boogeyman and

2462.76 --> 2469.4900000000002
yeah he he I I'll bet you because I

2467.0 --> 2472.46
can't hundred-percent confirm things at

2469.49 --> 2475.4599999999996
this point about many there's like

2472.46 --> 2479.54
multiple angles to what was going on who

2475.46 --> 2485.77
did what but yeah he was not a nice guy

2479.54 --> 2485.77
he was could be very harsh

2487.77 --> 2495.65
and there's proof of that at least and

2491.01 --> 2499.11
he was very verbal against Jews so yeah

2495.65 --> 2504.32
that's that and in that sense

2499.11 --> 2508.35
I'd like to say yeah thanks Hitler for

2504.32 --> 2514.6400000000003
kind of making the whole situation a

2508.35 --> 2514.64
little bit worse yeah

2516.26 --> 2520.48
but I don't think he was like the

2518.39 --> 2524.41
ultimate evil

2520.48 --> 2524.41
he was probably fooled

2526.3 --> 2531.26
it's like the whole media thing that

2528.86 --> 2532.55
happened around him that he was in Time

2531.26 --> 2536.21
magazine okay

2532.55 --> 2542.2000000000003
that's yeah this it's just a very

2536.21 --> 2545.09
complicated story right and yet stuffed

2542.2 --> 2547.1
involvement with Israel it's look I'm

2545.09 --> 2549.59
not there's probably people out there

2547.1 --> 2551.24
that already super study that this and

2549.59 --> 2554.42
there may be like you can extremely

2551.24 --> 2557.72
right-wing or whatever analysis I don't

2554.42 --> 2561.02
know but there is so much to what

2557.72 --> 2568.85
actually happen and how complicated and

2561.02 --> 2574.34
political everything was so but yeah I'm

2568.85 --> 2577.88
not going too deeply into it but this

2574.34 --> 2579.9500000000003
whole media driven [Â __Â ] that Hitler

2577.88 --> 2583.15
supposedly is the Othman evil I'm not

2579.95 --> 2583.1499999999996
buying it with [Â __Â ]

2585.21 --> 2593.73
so I think that's racist yeah you heard

2588.18 --> 2600.02
I think it's racist to say that Hitler

2593.73 --> 2600.02
is the ultimate evil yeah you heard me

2610.9 --> 2619.62
yeah the Jews that used to do oh yeah

2620.49 --> 2625.4399999999996
can't live with them can't live without

2623.23 --> 2625.44
them

2631.81 --> 2635.46
I'm not going

2641.77 --> 2653.099
try to keep from explaining it it's Jews

2646.24 --> 2655.72
are not yeah it's complicated there's so

2653.099 --> 2658.869
the Jews that came Christians Oh

2655.72 --> 2661.569
Benjamin kind of tells it like that that

2658.869 --> 2663.28
are Jews but they're they follow the

2661.569 --> 2668.77
path basically they get it

2663.28 --> 2671.77
and there's Jews that just gradually

2668.77 --> 2675.609
tear off logos until they lose their

2671.77 --> 2678.369
minds come very obsessive and [Â __Â ] and

2675.609 --> 2684.7599999999998
that's partially what is happening and

2678.369 --> 2689.109
it's weird how it works call them Turner

2684.76 --> 2692.619
yeah neither are you I'm not an expert

2689.109 --> 2699.46
on everything that's right but I do know

2692.619 --> 2705.099
a lot about everything and I also know

2699.46 --> 2709.7400000000002
that as a man I know very little of it

2705.099 --> 2712.9300000000003
all so I'm always open to basically

2709.74 --> 2715.75
reconsidering things that I know I do

2712.93 --> 2718.4199999999996
not fully understand and eventually yeah

2715.75 --> 2721.72
you go into multi possibility layering

2718.42 --> 2724.569
okay I do that I have multi possibility

2721.72 --> 2726.04
layers things simultaneously being

2724.569 --> 2727.63
possible and considering them

2726.04 --> 2729.819
simultaneously that's what I do with

2727.63 --> 2732.1600000000003
Cosmo Jeannie so I also do what I do

2729.819 --> 2735.91
with alternative history because I'm not

2732.16 --> 2738.04
setting my mind on a specific line like

2735.91 --> 2740.41
it has to be this and then everything's

2738.04 --> 2742.63
gonna adapt to that no because things

2740.41 --> 2746.74
turn out to just be more freaking

2742.63 --> 2751.3900000000003
complicated so there's just not a

2746.74 --> 2754.9199999999996
possibility layers and that's how I try

2751.39 --> 2757.92
to build my understanding and get closer

2754.92 --> 2757.92
to

2758.0 --> 2761.76
getting a pure reflection of how things

2761.4 --> 2764.9100000000003
work

2761.76 --> 2770.5400000000004
out there by reflecting on the akashic

2764.91 --> 2770.54
librarian just information in general Oh

2773.54 --> 2776.54
God

2785.15 --> 2788.4700000000003
that's servants

2791.87 --> 2796.7
there are even nukes and I'm gonna do

2794.57 --> 2799.28
that and we're definitely not gonna be

2796.7 --> 2805.31
calling for that [Â __Â ] in my chat thank

2799.28 --> 2811.67
you very much and any person out there

2805.31 --> 2814.31
that would think that blowing things up

2811.67 --> 2817.37
on the big scale to quickly solve it is

2814.31 --> 2820.22
gonna be the end is a complete [Â __Â ]

2817.37 --> 2823.79
because that's gonna be a starting sign

2820.22 --> 2826.2099999999996
and then lots of [Â __Â ] is gonna get blown

2823.79 --> 2830.57
up that's how it actually works get it

2826.21 --> 2834.2200000000003
so if you let yourself be stupid enough

2830.57 --> 2837.25
to actually call for like blow this up

2834.22 --> 2843.89
you maniac

2837.25 --> 2846.59
you know don't do that and it doesn't

2843.89 --> 2849.35
matter if nukes are fake or not big

2846.59 --> 2853.46
bombs exist and they've advanced in

2849.35 --> 2856.97
technology with military industrial

2853.46 --> 2859.58
complex and secret hidden [Â __Â ] secret

2856.97 --> 2861.77
lines of knowledge that we've barely

2859.58 --> 2865.52
even touched upon that they've developed

2861.77 --> 2868.49
and yet even though it might not be

2865.52 --> 2871.58
nuclear fission okay they might have big

2868.49 --> 2875.5099999999998
freaking bombs that are as good as atom

2871.58 --> 2879.67
bombs all right so don't be an idiot

2875.51 --> 2883.25
don't tempt fate just because you think

2879.67 --> 2886.0
something that happened in the past is

2883.25 --> 2886.0
fake right

2901.67 --> 2907.75
all right if they're just gonna poison

2904.22 --> 2908.9599999999996
us that yeah that has widespread

2907.75 --> 2912.529
repercussions

2908.96 --> 2915.319
look there's a tactical advantage to a

2912.529 --> 2918.17
big freakin explosion ever you don't

2915.319 --> 2920.869
have to do it on an entire region and it

2918.17 --> 2924.41
makes a huge moral impact that's the

2920.869 --> 2928.839
whole point of it it's terrifying it you

2924.41 --> 2932.029
just it is totally demoralizing and

2928.839 --> 2935.599
that's why it is so powerful that's why

2932.029 --> 2937.309
it's a fear in people okay if you're

2935.599 --> 2943.839
just poison everything that's really

2937.309 --> 2949.48
disgusting and evil and sneaky and yeah

2943.839 --> 2952.339
you there's absolutely no justification

2949.48 --> 2954.98
possible for something like that it's

2952.339 --> 2959.65
like totally evil and disgusting and

2954.98 --> 2959.65
just evil

2963.62 --> 2970.77
and yeah again localized if you just

2967.95 --> 2973.8799999999997
blow one thing up whatever then

2970.77 --> 2977.37
everything's gonna surrender probably

2973.88 --> 2979.44
depending on it yeah we're the big

2977.37 --> 2985.94
countries that shouldn't work but yeah

2979.44 --> 2988.71
it worked on Japan whatever that was so

2985.94 --> 2991.56
yeah they didn't have to blow the entire

2988.71 --> 2993.87
Japan up okay it's just one local thing

2991.56 --> 2999.39
so if you're gonna poison a region

2993.87 --> 3001.37
that's yeah what are you gonna do you

2999.39 --> 3005.39
can't brag about it because it's pure

3001.37 --> 3011.5699999999997
evil and disgusting so yeah it's just

3005.39 --> 3014.0
gonna be sneaky [Â __Â ] and doesn't do a

3011.57 --> 3017.36
lot except just yeah kill a bunch of

3014.0 --> 3021.37
people or did ruin the land or it's just

3017.36 --> 3021.3700000000003
messed up don't even start yeah

3027.92 --> 3033.61
tipping forwards

3029.63 --> 3033.61
the guys are all over the place

3041.17 --> 3045.299
how are you all talking about

3060.5 --> 3068.96
that continent I don't know what your

3064.25 --> 3072.01
sources are but yeah it sounds like

3068.96 --> 3075.01
you're the one who's misinformed here

3072.01 --> 3075.01
ridiculous

3076.69 --> 3084.57
you do realize that Islam is not a race

3079.18 --> 3084.5699999999997
right do you get that

3087.2 --> 3096.4399999999996
do you even understand the foundations

3090.77 --> 3098.66
of your own understanding okay do you

3096.44 --> 3105.619
know where it came from what it means or

3098.66 --> 3109.43
are you just following the the drum the

3105.619 --> 3113.54
narrative I don't know you better just

3109.43 --> 3117.1299999999997
stop before I just ban you or something

3113.54 --> 3117.13
because this is getting really annoying

3123.65 --> 3126.64
he's going nuts

3128.869 --> 3135.7090000000003
the bigotry

3132.26 --> 3135.7090000000003
[Music]

3139.13 --> 3143.44
you all up for some infighting

3144.4 --> 3147.599
[Music]

3154.56 --> 3159.54
yeah peanuts Clark I do my best but yeah

3157.83 --> 3165.93
it doesn't really work when everybody's

3159.54 --> 3168.68
doing it now is it what look I get it I

3165.93 --> 3173.1299999999997
get all the sides

3168.68 --> 3176.48
I'm just not so basic minded that I'm

3173.13 --> 3179.55
actually going to just go on one

3176.48 --> 3183.69
presented real track that kind of makes

3179.55 --> 3186.3300000000004
sense and then just go with that because

3183.69 --> 3187.79
it's a multi-layered thing it's so

3186.33 --> 3190.02
complicated

3187.79 --> 3192.36
everything has to run Origen their own

3190.02 --> 3194.94
motivation their own principles their

3192.36 --> 3200.04
own choices based on historical things

3194.94 --> 3202.26
and and corruptions and I told this many

3200.04 --> 3209.24
times before every group has their own

3202.26 --> 3214.4100000000003
type of corruptions every religion are

3209.24 --> 3218.79
haunted by dark influences that that

3214.41 --> 3221.3399999999997
mess up its design poisoning and then

3218.79 --> 3226.74
that poison becomes a control mechanism

3221.34 --> 3229.17
for imperialism this just sorry but it's

3226.74 --> 3231.45
with all these things that's why I don't

3229.17 --> 3235.5
prescribe to a specific religious

3231.45 --> 3239.73
narrative and its traditions and do my

3235.5 --> 3241.95
own thing to the path of Christ just try

3239.73 --> 3246.11
to make sense of everything be

3241.95 --> 3251.58
principled follow the principles and

3246.11 --> 3253.56
also learn about Roche Steiner and the

3251.58 --> 3256.64
concept of Ahriman and Lucifer in the

3253.56 --> 3256.64
middle path Christ

3257.97 --> 3268.109
then yeah that works it works you're

3261.089 --> 3274.52
really good for me Oh D for Israel right

3268.109 --> 3277.02
yeah Israel is just oh it's a mess but

3274.52 --> 3279.119
it is good to see that there's still

3277.02 --> 3283.41
some Israeli people out there that

3279.119 --> 3285.71
aren't just that still have some

3283.41 --> 3288.839
rebellion in them against the injustice

3285.71 --> 3292.14
it's good to see that that they're all

3288.839 --> 3294.99
still human you know and that yeah

3292.14 --> 3299.3689999999997
Jews are also humans it's just a couple

3294.99 --> 3301.6499999999996
of really messed up people in between

3299.369 --> 3304.29
them that have like really imperial

3301.65 --> 3310.76
ideas and that they've been holding on

3304.29 --> 3310.7599999999998
for probably hundreds of generations

3318.93 --> 3321.799
anyway

3328.36 --> 3337.36
yeah Rambo Jambo your your dick you're a

3333.94 --> 3340.65
total dick right okay

3337.36 --> 3344.61
I kind of agree that again these

3340.65 --> 3344.61
absolute pacifism is

3348.68 --> 3358.25
it's not the end of it look but in the

3355.43 --> 3360.859
physical world it kind of is in

3358.25 --> 3364.849
face-to-face social interactions it's

3360.859 --> 3369.38
actually much better I kind of apply it

3364.849 --> 3374.0
as much as I can but again self-defense

3369.38 --> 3375.859
is a is a sacred right and yeah I'm not

3374.0 --> 3379.549
gonna just let myself get knocked out

3375.859 --> 3383.75
just like that never so that's the

3379.549 --> 3385.7889999999998
difference but yeah when it comes to

3383.75 --> 3389.539
verbal interactions say through the

3385.789 --> 3392.63
internet yeah pacifism is completely

3389.539 --> 3395.3190000000004
useless because it is all about pushing

3392.63 --> 3395.319
the buttons

3399.49 --> 3407.54
but yeah it's look it's a very long time

3403.91 --> 3412.19
ago okay it was for that time and it was

3407.54 --> 3415.7
still kind of good but yeah it's not you

3412.19 --> 3418.09
know time keeps on going and these are

3415.7 --> 3422.27
our learning moments for everyone but

3418.09 --> 3424.4900000000002
shouldn't be too radical about any of

3422.27 --> 3426.95
these things these concepts and just try

3424.49 --> 3430.9399999999996
to assimilate what it's sensible for how

3426.95 --> 3436.64
things working out and see what is

3430.94 --> 3439.2200000000003
possible if you need see what

3436.64 --> 3441.47
maneuverability is left in how things

3439.22 --> 3446.0899999999997
work now because yeah it's tightening up

3441.47 --> 3451.7599999999998
hard things becoming pretty brutal in a

3446.09 --> 3455.8900000000003
way and very pushy aggressive in

3451.76 --> 3459.01
demeanor and yeah what can you do

3455.89 --> 3461.92
what works

3459.01 --> 3465.03
and we just have to take everything all

3461.92 --> 3470.7000000000003
the wise people in the past and just see

3465.03 --> 3470.7000000000003
yeah what makes sense for now

3478.24 --> 3482.8089999999997
ha

3480.109 --> 3487.0389999999998
that's that's kind of interesting you

3482.809 --> 3490.119
say that unsalted 667 Jews are like

3487.039 --> 3492.9790000000003
Frank Herbert's benefit Nibbana Jesuit

3490.119 --> 3495.319
they see religions in primitive

3492.979 --> 3498.259
population so they can pose as the

3495.319 --> 3503.5389999999998
savior and the chosen people at a later

3498.259 --> 3511.369
date to manipulate them yeah I wouldn't

3503.539 --> 3515.8390000000004
have the kind of agree it's but again

3511.369 --> 3522.859
this is you know I sometimes just almost

3515.839 --> 3528.589
refuse to call them Jews because they

3522.859 --> 3531.91
are with that group and there seems to

3528.589 --> 3535.16
be some kind of stability sort of

3531.91 --> 3539.3289999999997
between them but they're so different

3535.16 --> 3546.709
that almost the opposite of good news

3539.329 --> 3547.789
that's the weird thing it's it's two

3546.709 --> 3550.6299999999997
different worlds

3547.789 --> 3554.0190000000002
they're not really that much alike

3550.63 --> 3554.0190000000002
that's weird

3556.599 --> 3567.4700000000003
hey Owens hey welcome back dance yeah

3561.17 --> 3573.619
just come back in for a little bit what

3567.47 --> 3574.5789999999997
do you think of sign isn't it oh we can

3573.619 --> 3581.63
change the subject

3574.579 --> 3585.1400000000003
no it's too late for that Jews men tiny

3581.63 --> 3587.9
hats gal gadot soju juice Wonder Woman

3585.14 --> 3590.5989999999997
gal gadot oh no doubt

3587.9 --> 3595.039
Dave Wonder Woman I haven't seen the new

3590.599 --> 3599.299
one oh right teared yeah of their movie

3595.039 --> 3602.599
she spoke out god that book I like her

3599.299 --> 3605.779
so she was really cool in that movie and

3602.599 --> 3611.0
I like where she's going currently she

3605.779 --> 3612.769
was in the Israeli army right for like a

3611.0 --> 3615.589
year or two years I think they have to

3612.769 --> 3618.3689999999997
do national service yeah they do in

3615.589 --> 3618.369
Israel that's right

3624.04 --> 3637.54
was that it take you got oh I was just

3629.63 --> 3644.599
thinking of gal gadot look there's a

3637.54 --> 3647.81
love American Jews there are around

3644.599 --> 3655.06
definitely but it seems most of them are

3647.81 --> 3659.75
in Congress yeah partly Steve

3655.06 --> 3664.0099999999998
israeli-american double citizenship and

3659.75 --> 3666.98
that's like totally out there it's

3664.01 --> 3670.1600000000003
basically unheard of and yet it's just

3666.98 --> 3672.73
sitting there for a very long time it's

3670.16 --> 3672.73
just sitting there

3676.07 --> 3685.7000000000003
yeah it seems like there's just this

3680.869 --> 3685.7000000000003
unspoken relation or alliance

3689.75 --> 3695.76
are you gonna get a non-sentient see

3691.95 --> 3701.43
browse book Holly what are you gonna buy

3695.76 --> 3704.25
antenna HC Russ this book no yeah bit I

3701.43 --> 3707.73
didn't know he had a book but no I don't

3704.25 --> 3710.16
support that guide anything I'll listen

3707.73 --> 3714.53
to somebody telling me what is in it

3710.16 --> 3714.5299999999997
but no I'm not gonna buy his book No

3716.35 --> 3722.38
so what is it about I think it's about

3720.22 --> 3724.18
the Sun but I think he explains

3722.38 --> 3736.12
everything there's a map in there as

3724.18 --> 3741.52
well I'd love to him but they're going

3736.12 --> 3745.21
for like 20 pounds 30 pounds well yeah I

3741.52 --> 3747.43
might wait till somebody reviews that

3745.21 --> 3750.46
maybe but i have bid on one but I just

3747.43 --> 3752.35
keep getting outbid I don't to pay like

3750.46 --> 3755.89
hundreds of pounds for one boss

3752.35 --> 3757.66
I think it'll die down a little bit and

3755.89 --> 3767.35
then I'll bid and hopefully there won't

3757.66 --> 3769.3599999999997
be too many bitter I'm kind of curious

3767.35 --> 3771.67
what he thinks about the Sun but I

3769.36 --> 3780.9900000000002
almost already know he's probably

3771.67 --> 3784.4500000000003
completely wrong maybe he's wrong a lot

3780.99 --> 3788.2299999999996
and he switches it and he pretends like

3784.45 --> 3791.22
nothing happened and he's not very open

3788.23 --> 3791.22
in his building

3791.88 --> 3801.599
although yeah is smart but oh yeah

3798.819 --> 3806.13
Voynich what do I have against him well

3801.599 --> 3811.779
he's a total dick an egomaniac an

3806.13 --> 3814.2690000000002
extremely vain and manipulative has very

3811.779 --> 3817.269
little sense of actual loyalty and he

3814.269 --> 3822.1899999999996
uses the concept for political

3817.269 --> 3829.2099999999996
maneuverability and yeah an overall

3822.19 --> 3832.65
creepy guy in my opinion political

3829.21 --> 3832.65
maneuverability yeah

3838.72 --> 3846.45
I'm not talking about like Blum Democrat

3842.44 --> 3850.119
Republican politics that [Â __Â ] but just

3846.45 --> 3852.569
losing friends and like keep them on

3850.119 --> 3852.569
your side

3857.92 --> 3870.73
I don't think he even understands the

3860.44 --> 3872.77
concept of actual loyalty not really no

3870.73 --> 3875.94
no I don't have a lot of this to say

3872.77 --> 3875.94
about Antonio

3898.53 --> 3908.51
they still drink the nani juice yeah i

3904.23 --> 3908.51
still have it but no I don't need

3911.83 --> 3924.4
now I'm doing great like green tea to

3915.8 --> 3924.4
drink that tea every year

3925.97 --> 3931.3399999999997
you've got probably skilled the street

3927.59 --> 3933.5
talk about tea talking about drinks what

3931.34 --> 3937.52
you're British you're culturally

3933.5 --> 3938.96
obligated to yeah week of milk in it

3937.52 --> 3941.09
don't you know that's weird

3938.96 --> 3946.13
most of Europe does that milk for at

3941.09 --> 3950.1800000000003
least have to have milk in it I used to

3946.13 --> 3952.4300000000003
do that sometimes I think my yeah my

3950.18 --> 3956.7799999999997
grandmother like that it that way as

3952.43 --> 3960.22
well but no I'm I drink green tea just

3956.78 --> 3960.2200000000003
like that no sugar anything

3965.43 --> 3973.0099999999998
right so yeah I'm gonna round out the

3967.86 --> 3973.01
show and get on Nathan's panel

3976.35 --> 3979.88
so thanks for coming down

3980.98 --> 3984.91
yeah you're welcome yeah Pete che was on

3983.47 --> 3987.52
that yesterday wasn't he but he was just

3984.91 --> 3990.37
rambling on okay I can't even remember

3987.52 --> 3994.45
what he was actually saying now you are

3990.37 --> 3996.97
thinking he was loosely trying to

3994.45 --> 4000.96
explain it the connections in very

3996.97 --> 4005.7
sloppy way and he hasn't done anything

4000.96 --> 4008.16
he's lazy as [Â __Â ] he could have done so

4005.7 --> 4011.8199999999997
much to expand on this Aristarchus

4008.16 --> 4013.8599999999997
theory like I feel like it's almost a

4011.82 --> 4015.6600000000003
waste because he may have caught a

4013.86 --> 4017.7200000000003
glimpse of something really interesting

4015.66 --> 4022.17
but he's just not doing anything with it

4017.72 --> 4026.0699999999997
except rambling on staying vague it's

4022.17 --> 4028.17
super annoying yeah sometimes it's a

4026.07 --> 4030.9
mess sometimes you can hit the nail on

4028.17 --> 4036.56
the head there sometimes you can just go

4030.9 --> 4039.09
off on the tangent yeah I don't

4036.56 --> 4041.06
personally agree with him about the 9/11

4039.09 --> 4049.4300000000003
story and all that sort of stuff

4041.06 --> 4049.43
then no one died somebody wants to die

4053.48 --> 4060.98
i what

4056.84 --> 4066.05
where are you getting that oh yeah PJ's

4060.98 --> 4068.39
a big 9/11 to denier no he's yeah he

4066.05 --> 4074.15
thinks that nobody died on 9/11 it's all

4068.39 --> 4079.6099999999997
fake I think a lot of people have

4074.15 --> 4082.13
disagreed with him over that pretty sure

4079.61 --> 4085.79
that a lot of the rescue workers did

4082.13 --> 4088.94
actually die you know like getting dust

4085.79 --> 4092.06
in their lungs and [Â __Â ] yeah definitely

4088.94 --> 4095.36
and so yeah I don't know if like in the

4092.06 --> 4098.66
building I'm just not going there it's

4095.36 --> 4101.24
too far for me but there's no rescue

4098.66 --> 4103.58
workers died you could they were on

4101.24 --> 4108.26
video you could see how they were

4103.58 --> 4111.109
physically degenerating okay so yeah

4108.26 --> 4112.85
people did die maybe not like during the

4111.109 --> 4115.1900000000005
accident but in the aftermath

4112.85 --> 4119.77
they definitely definitely did I've seen

4115.19 --> 4119.7699999999995
it so

4120.099 --> 4124.109
yeah add in our PJs

4127.02 --> 4136.35
do something beachy actually build some

4130.74 --> 4138.24
data some backup - so you have something

4136.35 --> 4140.700000000001
to show for when you bring up your

4138.24 --> 4145.8
Aristarchus theory instead of just yeah

4140.7 --> 4151.4
you really will do something having such

4145.8 --> 4151.400000000001
a lazy [Â __Â ] she brought to focus of it

4151.46 --> 4157.83
just get a computer and actually start

4155.61 --> 4164.339999999999
to compare images start to back up some

4157.83 --> 4167.79
proof for his theory instead of just

4164.34 --> 4172.32
loose claims that obviously or not so

4167.79 --> 4175.38
obviously barely make sense anyway

4172.32 --> 4179.8099999999995
enough about that I really am gonna

4175.38 --> 4184.76
round out the show so see you later dad

4179.81 --> 4184.76
yeah seal a Arlen alright

4188.709 --> 4194.4
so yeah thanks everyone for coming it's
