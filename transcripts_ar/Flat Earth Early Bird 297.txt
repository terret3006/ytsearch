[Music]

192.67 --> 204.01
oh wow okay so you had a super long

199.89 --> 208.66
party working night or you have a night

204.01 --> 217.98
shift what do you do like a truck driver

208.66 --> 224.709
with late shifts or or a guard security

217.98 --> 228.07
or just very work late shifts well

224.709 --> 233.13
anyway thanks for popping by before

228.07 --> 239.07
going to bed I presume that's a secret

233.13 --> 239.07
okay all right

246.11 --> 256.73900000000003
just being curious so yesterday was a

252.33 --> 260.19
pretty good day I did stay a pretty late

256.739 --> 262.13899999999995
or rather had a another Skype call or at

260.19 --> 265.53
the rest and he kept me up just way too

262.139 --> 274.29
late that guy always has so much to say

265.53 --> 281.29999999999995
he was good though some interesting idea

274.29 --> 283.56
and I was way too tired to even yeah let

281.3 --> 288.99
seriously think about those types of

283.56 --> 291.84
complicated ideas but just slowly the

288.99 --> 293.06
other thing and the idea sink thinking

291.84 --> 297.38899999999995
about it

293.06 --> 300.18
anyway yeah so basically for what I can

297.389 --> 302.66
do to kind of crawl fun from underneath

300.18 --> 306.47
my social where welfare situation

302.66 --> 309.84000000000003
because it does require a transition

306.47 --> 313.08000000000004
just gradually growing in the amount of

309.84 --> 318.98999999999995
income it's gonna do very little it's

313.08 --> 323.27
got to be a swift shift otherwise it's

318.99 --> 326.81
just not gonna help so no I guess

323.27 --> 329.34
friends and I are friends of mine are

326.81 --> 335.55
thinking along with me yeah I do

329.34 --> 338.35999999999996
appreciate that but usually this kind of

335.55 --> 338.36
thing is a bit of a

340.08 --> 348.24
takes a lot of time for me to to let

344.38 --> 352.9
like big life-altering ideas sink in

348.24 --> 356.53000000000003
creature of habit and yeah that's just

352.9 --> 359.02
grounded in me it's not something that I

356.53 --> 361.09
do just because I wanted and then if I

359.02 --> 364.35999999999996
don't do it everything will be just fine

361.09 --> 365.46999999999997
no because if I just allow myself to

364.36 --> 367.57
make those tight

365.47 --> 371.259
life altering choices constantly very

367.57 --> 373.77
rapidly without having a time to let it

371.259 --> 377.47
sink in I'll get a severe psychological

373.77 --> 383.68
backlash from that when I do that it's

377.47 --> 390.3
not nice when that happens I can lose

383.68 --> 394.36
lose my my my foundations basically

390.3 --> 404.86
spiritually if I do that and then drift

394.36 --> 408.84000000000003
off into all kinds of weird things but

404.86 --> 408.84000000000003
yeah anyway that's still going

412.99 --> 424.72
and I had a lot of comments especially

418.03 --> 428.69899999999996
David Brisbane please stop spamming my

424.72 --> 428.699
comment section if you would please

446.68 --> 454.0
right yeah it's been mostly a repeat

450.52 --> 459.789
upload from from rileys live performance

454.0 --> 461.65
on the street he uploaded it to his own

459.789 --> 463.889
channel and cut out the piece or he was

461.65 --> 463.88899999999995
there

470.85 --> 475.06
McTeer a weights

472.66 --> 478.62
apparently quantum eraser was premiering

475.06 --> 478.62
something I completely missed that

479.41 --> 482.559
[Music]

493.86 --> 499.14
oh yeah I finally made dinner it's yeah

496.35 --> 502.17
now I remember that took like three

499.14 --> 507.47999999999996
hours oh and apparently there's new

502.17 --> 511.01
people now moving in here down stairs so

507.48 --> 514.77
like an emergency fit I don't even know

511.01 --> 517.59
what the idea is like my landlord just

514.77 --> 520.1999999999999
decided upon that and it seems more like

517.59 --> 523.26
it's an emergency situation not a

520.2 --> 526.23
serious move like they needed a shelter

523.26 --> 527.85
or some some kind it's weird I don't

526.23 --> 531.87
know I met them yesterday they seemed

527.85 --> 536.91
kind of nice people they're not creepy

531.87 --> 539.88
in any way so but it is kind of weird to

536.91 --> 542.16
just suddenly have no people moving in

539.88 --> 547.89
pretty yeah we're already living with

542.16 --> 553.68
four people here now so it's not that

547.89 --> 555.93
big a house yeah now it's gonna be five

553.68 --> 561.6899999999999
well I don't know if they're going to be

555.93 --> 563.9
here all the time maybe I don't know

561.69 --> 567.1300000000001
what's going on they did

563.9 --> 567.13
[Music]

572.399 --> 575.399
yeah

575.93 --> 581.93
yeah I have an idea of what that could

578.45 --> 586.5500000000001
be but yeah they just got here first day

581.93 --> 588.3499999999999
so are we watching in the next month to

586.55 --> 590.1999999999999
see what their deal is

588.35 --> 594.32
could be they're just using it as a

590.2 --> 596.63
registry address in order for finances

594.32 --> 598.9100000000001
to be established and that they're kind

596.63 --> 600.92
of people that basically constantly stay

598.91 --> 603.7099999999999
on the streets or stay over with other

600.92 --> 613.99
people who knows what's going on I don't

603.71 --> 613.99
know whatever

619.67 --> 630.4799999999999
hopefully the company will be worth it

622.44 --> 633.4200000000001
I don't know I think I got a pretty much

630.48 --> 638.6700000000001
I got a kind of understanding now with

633.42 --> 642.4499999999999
everyone else here kind of attuned to

638.67 --> 645.06
one another now there's like a like a

642.45 --> 648.8100000000001
durable peace atmosphere and yeah this

645.06 --> 651.8
is kind of new and it's a girl white

648.81 --> 651.8
away moving in so

660.44 --> 666.74
yeah Trish Blythe I thought about it and

663.02 --> 672.34
every time I did I thought yeah no no

666.74 --> 672.34
way no way

677.54 --> 686.0799999999999
no I haven't got my hair since I was 11

683.93 --> 686.0799999999999
I think

688.09 --> 694.48
I do try to maintain it so you don't

691.12 --> 697.72
need to get the like the broken hairs

694.48 --> 700.21
all that but so kind of like trimming

697.72 --> 704.59
but that's it I don't cut it I'm not

700.21 --> 714.52
gonna do anything other than the long

704.59 --> 717.34
hair I have right now especially if I

714.52 --> 728.76
just washed it and it's not freaking hot

717.34 --> 728.76
and my hair can be really nice no meow

736.62 --> 742.32
[Music]

738.86 --> 745.26
funny thing is also that having my hair

742.32 --> 749.8100000000001
loose when it's fret a lot colder then

745.26 --> 752.91
it actually is kind of nice because

749.81 --> 756.4499999999999
there is a lot of heat being trapped in

752.91 --> 758.13
in yeah in between my hair I always

756.45 --> 759.57
noticed that and when it's really hot

758.13 --> 763.17
then I'm gonna have my hair loose it's

759.57 --> 765.09
just like too much heat it can't escape

763.17 --> 766.89
but when it's fresh or when it's very

765.09 --> 771.87
cold then it's actually kind of Pleasant

766.89 --> 778.31
and my hair takes a cold very well must

771.87 --> 778.3100000000001
be in elven traits or something

798.95 --> 805.01
come on chew and chew on Carlos you

802.73 --> 813.26
could do better than that that's just so

805.01 --> 817.49
dumb that is so dumb not not even Laurie

813.26 --> 819.73
would make that level of joke come on

817.49 --> 819.73
dude

825.42 --> 832.56
[Music]

827.39 --> 838.1999999999999
no trace flight no permission absolutely

832.56 --> 843.06
not it's not up for anything I'm not

838.2 --> 845.37
gonna change my hair and also by the way

843.06 --> 848.13
there's not gonna be any other parts of

845.37 --> 851.94
how I look or what I do of my or my

848.13 --> 855.33
mannerisms or my decisions that you are

851.94 --> 856.83
allowed to alter or decide that you're

855.33 --> 858.99
going to exert some kind of peer

856.83 --> 861.0
pressure in order for me to change that

858.99 --> 874.11
because you think you have the right to

861.0 --> 876.45
because you don't just so you know you

874.11 --> 879.51
know anyone can make a suggestion but

876.45 --> 882.99
you are not gonna do you're gonna not

879.51 --> 886.73
gonna make me do something that's in

882.99 --> 890.66
your mind you'd better step away bad

886.73 --> 890.66
it's not welcome here

895.21 --> 903.85
yeah yeah Trish Blythe and guess what

898.88 --> 907.16
my ex-girlfriend loved my long hair she

903.85 --> 910.97
insisted that I keep it exactly like

907.16 --> 917.29
that because when I took it loose like

910.97 --> 921.64
she kind of melted away and the girls

917.29 --> 925.2199999999999
the girl types that I tend to like

921.64 --> 928.43
generally like me having long hair so

925.22 --> 929.6800000000001
you're not gonna be altering the way I

928.43 --> 932.5699999999999
look okay

929.68 --> 936.6099999999999
good morning by the way Amanda young

932.57 --> 940.1
thank you for the $10 which a donation

936.61 --> 942.17

940.1 --> 944.87
eating any edibles during the show

942.17 --> 947.0799999999999
that's what you're asking but I'll be

944.87 --> 949.88
having baked eggs for lunch

947.08 --> 952.13
after and in the evening I'll be having

949.88 --> 956.0
chili because I made that yesterday took

952.13 --> 958.73
three hours was very good though made

956.0 --> 964.85
the two days of not having dinner quite

958.73 --> 967.3000000000001
worth it so yeah that's what I'm gonna

964.85 --> 967.3000000000001
be eating

968.81 --> 976.91
[Music]

973.87 --> 979.01
yeah okay if you're gonna keep on

976.91 --> 981.5799999999999
pushing that trash flight I will block

979.01 --> 985.66
you because I'm sick of this attitude I

981.58 --> 989.9000000000001
was very clear about this and you're not

985.66 --> 992.56
you're not changing your demeanor here

989.9 --> 992.56
stop it

994.73 --> 999.919
[Music]

1004.74 --> 1011.8
because I wasn't hungry Lahti that's why

1007.72 --> 1016.99
I didn't need it I just went to bed

1011.8 --> 1019.42
early I don't know I use it as fasting

1016.99 --> 1021.82
sometimes I just choose like no not

1019.42 --> 1026.3999999999999
gonna do dinner don't really need to

1021.82 --> 1026.4
don't feel that bad for not doing it

1039.31 --> 1044.799
[Music]

1046.049 --> 1048.799
hmm

1050.88 --> 1059.5700000000002
all right

1053.63 --> 1059.99
all right secret Asian man yeah me

1059.57 --> 1062.24
neither

1059.99 --> 1066.23
I've always been very picky about my

1062.24 --> 1068.77
women and hey there when I go around

1066.23 --> 1070.46
there's plenty of looks I get oh yeah

1068.77 --> 1073.1
definitely

1070.46 --> 1077.65
because I don't look like a [ __ ]

1073.1 --> 1083.03
[ __ ] compared to what is trendy people

1077.65 --> 1086.539
wearing t-shirts and pants in like baby

1083.03 --> 1089.51
colors with stupid baby like patterns on

1086.539 --> 1092.39
them and that's normal so yeah if a guy

1089.51 --> 1097.669
actually looks like a man with long

1092.39 --> 1099.98
black coat and a distinct style and yeah

1097.669 --> 1104.0800000000002
that draws the attention some women they

1099.98 --> 1107.69
kind of think that's interesting so I

1104.08 --> 1110.809
but the problem is is it mutual because

1107.69 --> 1116.9
I'm freaking picky and it's not going

1110.809 --> 1119.33
away and I don't want to act in the face

1116.9 --> 1121.429
of a woman like I really like her when I

1119.33 --> 1123.34
don't just to get sex or something

1121.429 --> 1125.929
that's just disgusting

1123.34 --> 1130.49
to be fair I know it from experience

1125.929 --> 1132.74
because I did that like twice and just

1130.49 --> 1135.919
ended up like horribly regretting it

1132.74 --> 1138.59
because I'd literally hurt their feeling

1135.919 --> 1140.39
I just was forced by my nature to

1138.59 --> 1142.9399999999998
eventually just come out clean about it

1140.39 --> 1145.5490000000002
and then really hurt their feelings and

1142.94 --> 1147.53
then I did we had really hurt their

1145.549 --> 1152.3899999999999
feelings that they didn't really deserve

1147.53 --> 1156.3999999999999
and then I gotta live with the memory of

1152.39 --> 1156.4
that so

1156.6 --> 1167.9699999999998
yeah you know I've had my share of

1162.96 --> 1170.009
girlfriends it's not like epic but it's

1167.97 --> 1179.039
more than I can count on two hands at

1170.009 --> 1182.279
least it's all hey and some of them were

1179.039 --> 1184.95
really amazing individual so cuz that's

1182.279 --> 1187.529
the one I really want but it's also

1184.95 --> 1190.1100000000001
about the moment and about what I'm

1187.529 --> 1193.73
doing and if they fall in line with that

1190.11 --> 1198.99
if they like what I'm doing it's it's

1193.73 --> 1201.3890000000001
always been by chance that these really

1198.99 --> 1204.09
serious relationships came into being

1201.389 --> 1208.35
because we would just subtly cross paths

1204.09 --> 1209.6689999999999
in exactly the right moment it you can't

1208.35 --> 1213.509
make that happen

1209.669 --> 1217.5
it just happens especially when you

1213.509 --> 1219.419
don't expect it so that's my experience

1217.5 --> 1221.659
that's how I met my ex that was just

1219.419 --> 1221.659
crazy

1224.149 --> 1229.619
yeah

1226.17 --> 1229.6190000000001
[Music]

1232.96 --> 1239.89
no-no-no permission to speak out now

1236.65 --> 1239.89
Trish Blythe

1242.14 --> 1244.92
you don't

1252.78 --> 1255.97
[Music]

1254.58 --> 1259.1499999999999
all right

1255.97 --> 1259.15
[Music]

1288.08 --> 1296.6799999999998
yes lotty I'm pretty sure that's what I

1290.87 --> 1296.6799999999998
said no not at wants the hell

1303.34 --> 1306.48
[Music]

1330.8 --> 1341.72
yeah I know what that secret is Trish

1335.69 --> 1345.71
Blythe I know how to get to a woman you

1341.72 --> 1351.1100000000001
know what the secret is that they are

1345.71 --> 1354.92
worthy and then I the real thing that I

1351.11 --> 1358.6399999999999
want the dream that I am carrying can be

1354.92 --> 1362.27
unleashed and then I show my full power

1358.64 --> 1370.9
as I did with my ex and they literally

1362.27 --> 1370.9
just submit its it sounds creepy but it

1371.95 --> 1380.51
they just know in the moment because I

1377.33 --> 1384.8899999999999
am that certain about I'm that confident

1380.51 --> 1388.19
in that moment and I allow myself to

1384.89 --> 1390.5
fall in love which is always with the

1388.19 --> 1393.88
huge backlash of course if it eventually

1390.5 --> 1397.31
breaks so that's why I don't allow that

1393.88 --> 1400.1000000000001
anymore unless I just know and it's

1397.31 --> 1403.1599999999999
unleashed and then all these extra side

1400.1 --> 1413.56
effects come that I know how to utilize

1403.16 --> 1416.5700000000002
so it's just once I figure out a girl or

1413.56 --> 1419.33
basically they stand out to me really

1416.57 --> 1421.4299999999998
big I can see at their mannerisms at

1419.33 --> 1424.73
their responses to other people that

1421.43 --> 1427.8700000000001
they are struggling to with their

1424.73 --> 1430.91
intelligence in the face of humanity and

1427.87 --> 1437.4499999999998
that there is looking for some

1430.91 --> 1440.6000000000001
companionship in that and yeah that is

1437.45 --> 1444.53
for me a clear attractor that for me and

1440.6 --> 1447.7099999999998
then I will definitely take risks or

1444.53 --> 1450.02
well for me like I will just go there in

1447.71 --> 1452.06
some way and just say hello just try to

1450.02 --> 1455.0
get the attention something I usually

1452.06 --> 1458.06
don't do but in such a moment I would

1455.0 --> 1461.51
and then once I figure out like yeah the

1458.06 --> 1464.25
girl kind of likes me and also there is

1461.51 --> 1467.33
a spiritual self

1464.25 --> 1471.06
just communication dialogue going on

1467.33 --> 1472.86
then I will just pound her from that

1471.06 --> 1477.51
moment on like okay am I going to

1472.86 --> 1480.8999999999999
unleash this and it usually takes not

1477.51 --> 1482.55
longer than a week before I can make a

1480.9 --> 1489.3300000000002
decision on that and then it's just like

1482.55 --> 1493.3999999999999
yeah I'm gonna go fall in and allow

1489.33 --> 1493.3999999999999
myself to truly fall in love

1504.47 --> 1511.06
so anyway that's yeah I take

1508.34 --> 1513.98
relationships very seriously and I take

1511.06 --> 1517.57
being in love very serious because it's

1513.98 --> 1517.57
very dangerous to me

1519.62 --> 1522.76
[Music]

1543.9 --> 1546.8600000000001
she is

1553.78 --> 1561.4289999999999
mm anyway that's how it works

1571.93 --> 1578.71
and yeah in order one of these things is

1575.35 --> 1582.76
one of the conditions for that to be

1578.71 --> 1585.93
able to unfold for me to engage in that

1582.76 --> 1590.14
to allow that to manifest is to have

1585.93 --> 1591.46
money to spend and I met my ex when I

1590.14 --> 1595.69
had money to spend

1591.46 --> 1600.25
I was already being very careful but I

1595.69 --> 1606.04
just it was such it I just couldn't not

1600.25 --> 1609.46
do it couldn't and I'm just not in that

1606.04 --> 1613.27
position get to know girls you know I

1609.46 --> 1614.5
could do that but I will just not be

1613.27 --> 1616.54
very bitey

1614.5 --> 1619.96
and that is something that's gonna be

1616.54 --> 1622.74
weird to a lot of girls I guess in this

1619.96 --> 1626.17
time because no sex so normal you just

1622.74 --> 1628.6
do whatever and I don't really like that

1626.17 --> 1632.23
by the way thank you the observer for

1628.6 --> 1633.73
the 199 dollar super chat donation don't

1632.23 --> 1643.35
take life too seriously

1633.73 --> 1643.35
I disagree I take it very seriously

1648.47 --> 1655.1000000000001
but on the other hand if you say don't

1651.77 --> 1658.3899999999999
take feelings too seriously then I'd say

1655.1 --> 1662.9599999999998
agree if you dwell on feelings that's

1658.39 --> 1666.8000000000002
yeah dude that can you can get totally

1662.96 --> 1668.99
drugged out just from feelings if you

1666.8 --> 1675.29
allow yourself to engorge in that and

1668.99 --> 1677.8700000000001
drown in it self induced drama or

1675.29 --> 1679.58
romance ideas all that that can be

1677.87 --> 1683.9599999999998
addicting as well it's just self into

1679.58 --> 1688.4299999999998
his feelings addiction don't take it too

1683.96 --> 1690.88
seriously indeed be very careful with

1688.43 --> 1690.88
feelings

1694.04 --> 1700.19
and realize that when feelings are

1696.59 --> 1702.8899999999999
really strong they attend to alter the

1700.19 --> 1705.41
way we see things just be aware of that

1702.89 --> 1708.47
that feelings have a tendency to

1705.41 --> 1711.19
malformed what you see and the more you

1708.47 --> 1715.16
realize this the more you look at it and

1711.19 --> 1717.77
just allow yourself to see it then

1715.16 --> 1721.3400000000001
eventually you'll start to know exactly

1717.77 --> 1723.95
how those feelings can change what you

1721.34 --> 1726.7099999999998
see change your perception what type of

1723.95 --> 1728.6000000000001
frequencies where you will not be able

1726.71 --> 1731.39
to pick up you wouldn't start to notice

1728.6 --> 1733.49
which ones want what is filtered out

1731.39 --> 1735.92
because of a specific type of feeling

1733.49 --> 1739.04
and you will know very that's probably

1735.92 --> 1742.22
very quickly what type of typical idea

1739.04 --> 1744.1599999999999
or spiraling ideas fueled by those

1742.22 --> 1749.21
feelings will start to arrive

1744.16 --> 1752.3300000000002
correlating with those feelings and it's

1749.21 --> 1755.42
never good to dwell on any of it but it

1752.33 --> 1758.1499999999999
is good to realize how it alters what

1755.42 --> 1761.72
you see so you don't get fooled by your

1758.15 --> 1763.94
own feelings it's very difficult though

1761.72 --> 1766.55
most people just don't have the control

1763.94 --> 1769.16
of red ones feelings really take full

1766.55 --> 1771.11
grab by the way thank you good serving

1769.16 --> 1773.8300000000002
for the one dollar super donation much

1771.11 --> 1773.83
appreciated

[Music]

1780.55 --> 1784.359
[Music]

1791.83 --> 1794.96
[Music]

1810.97 --> 1819.05
well Trish Blythe I see you're advising

1815.24 --> 1823.4
a GM here on his feelings I think that

1819.05 --> 1825.32
if HM was ready to move on then it'll

1823.4 --> 1827.5700000000002
happen naturally because first those

1825.32 --> 1830.809
feelings of your ex just have to die out

1827.57 --> 1832.9099999999999
and my dad told me taught me and I've

1830.809 --> 1835.61
been reflected from other sources as

1832.91 --> 1839.69
well there's kind of a fist rule for it

1835.61 --> 1841.7299999999998
and that is as long the length you are

1839.69 --> 1844.28
in a relationship a serious relationship

1841.73 --> 1847.16
like moving in together all that being

1844.28 --> 1851.059
very serious and dedicated the length of

1847.16 --> 1853.5500000000002
a relationship once you break up double

1851.059 --> 1856.8799999999999
that after that point before you

1853.55 --> 1860.05
actually truly get over it it just takes

1856.88 --> 1863.8400000000001
twice as long as the entire relationship

1860.05 --> 1868.8799999999999
that's just unfortunate truth it seems

1863.84 --> 1872.84
it seems to work for me funny enough

1868.88 --> 1881.179
it's been six years and the relationship

1872.84 --> 1883.8799999999999
lasted three so by that standard some

1881.179 --> 1887.96
woman could just be rolling right in

1883.88 --> 1890.0900000000001
front of my face any moment now to be

1887.96 --> 1892.28
fair I'm almost not looking forward to

1890.09 --> 1896.35
it because I just know how much of an

1892.28 --> 1899.059
impact that kind of [ __ ] makes on me and

1896.35 --> 1901.1899999999998
that's also a sign that it's probably

1899.059 --> 1903.53
gonna happen because that's exactly how

1901.19 --> 1908.72
I felt about it the last time right

1903.53 --> 1911.95
before I met my ex so I'd be lucky let's

1908.72 --> 1911.95
just say I'd be lucky to just

1913.43 --> 1920.0800000000002
have some more time to get myself sorted

1917.21 --> 1923.03
out before that happens

1920.08 --> 1925.9399999999998
financially I mean because yeah in this

1923.03 --> 1931.3899999999999
financial situation any relationship

1925.94 --> 1931.39
that can't be durable it just can't work

1931.45 --> 1938.0900000000001
because I can't attain the position that

1935.78 --> 1940.96
I require in order for it to become

1938.09 --> 1940.9599999999998
durable

1952.47 --> 1965.97
the porn yeah yeah porn it's it's

1960.519 --> 1965.97
disgusting totally agree

1978.63 --> 1985.5300000000002
then again you know the mind can bring

1983.789 --> 1987.48
you or basically the swings of the

1985.53 --> 1995.37
pendulum can bring you in all kinds of

1987.48 --> 1996.929
direction sometimes just to get ahead it

1995.37 --> 1999.51
feels almost like you need to do

1996.929 --> 2001.88
something wrong in order to stumble and

1999.51 --> 2005.36
then just proceed in the cycle in order

2001.88 --> 2013.3700000000001
to climb up again it's weird how that

2005.36 --> 2015.4089999999999
works but yeah you know I've listened to

2013.37 --> 2018.1689999999999
own Benjamin concerning the porn and

2015.409 --> 2021.2600000000002
it's just completely correct and the

2018.169 --> 2023.63
weird thing is as I do and yeah you can

2021.26 --> 2028.33
say of it whatever I do tend to study

2023.63 --> 2033.47
these things and I've even as it were

2028.33 --> 2035.6299999999999
well when I watch that I'm just it's not

2033.47 --> 2038.78
just physical to me because I really do

2035.63 --> 2040.8200000000002
try to size up like what is going on

2038.78 --> 2043.49
what are they acting what are they

2040.82 --> 2047.57
actually feeling what is their overall

2043.49 --> 2050.81
tension level or what is probably gonna

2047.57 --> 2052.73
come right after this I I can't help it

2050.81 --> 2057.409
I'm curious to these things especially

2052.73 --> 2060.29
because that's because it's all an act

2057.409 --> 2063.05
and it's kind of forced force one way or

2060.29 --> 2066.169
the other and the forcing process can be

2063.05 --> 2068.75
kept very close to the heart with the

2066.169 --> 2071.419
more professionals and they're just very

2068.75 --> 2073.94
fluid actors very convincing and with

2071.419 --> 2080.23
others it's not so forward and then

2073.94 --> 2080.23
things there that gana gets creepy

2082.0 --> 2093.97
anyway but just is in general I'm just

2089.169 --> 2098.8399999999997
almost astounded how disgusting porn has

2093.97 --> 2102.68
become just like that that is like the

2098.84 --> 2104.9300000000003
things that are out there are like there

2102.68 --> 2107.24
were already pretty weird things out

2104.93 --> 2108.89
there say around 2000 you know when the

2107.24 --> 2110.4199999999996
internet pretty much first came up there

2108.89 --> 2114.14
you know

2110.42 --> 2115.94
Japan it's all sorts of weird things

2114.14 --> 2122.569
coming out of there that are like now

2115.94 --> 2126.71
tagged intertwine with that but that's

2122.569 --> 2131.9
not all there came much more weird and

2126.71 --> 2135.26
freaky and like really like that you go

2131.9 --> 2137.029
like what the [ __ ] is that not in a

2135.26 --> 2141.4100000000003
sense that's something really like

2137.029 --> 2144.619
bloody like really evil a direct acts

2141.41 --> 2150.5589999999997
but just like what the hell who thinks

2144.619 --> 2158.809
this is sexy this is just so so far oh

2150.559 --> 2162.1400000000003
it's like modern art of porn that [ __ ]

2158.809 --> 2164.21
is out there it's so idiotic it's out

2162.14 --> 2167.24
there and people are actually interested

2164.21 --> 2169.069
apparently I don't know how they could

2167.24 --> 2170.839
have rolled into that maybe just because

2169.069 --> 2172.7
of the curiosity of it and they don't

2170.839 --> 2174.2889999999998
and they all take it lightly that's the

2172.7 --> 2176.1189999999997
only way I can imagine that you could

2174.289 --> 2181.9700000000003
sleep into that kind of order it's just

2176.119 --> 2188.2400000000002
so weird people so weird because what I

2181.97 --> 2192.7099999999996
consider as well am i entertaining porn

2188.24 --> 2198.339
that's all just I don't know it's not

2192.71 --> 2203.569
ultra basic like old old-fashioned only

2198.339 --> 2206.029
but it's not that freaky new and I don't

2203.569 --> 2210.049
like when it gets really disgusting as

2206.029 --> 2211.609
in most people have their own kind of

2210.049 --> 2214.16
level as to what they think is really

2211.609 --> 2216.8289999999997
disgusting but overall it seems like

2214.16 --> 2219.3799999999997
just a regular disgusting behavior has

2216.829 --> 2223.46
started to become normalized even among

2219.38 --> 2225.98
wreck and it's sometimes you just faced

2223.46 --> 2230.15
with [ __ ] and you're just like ah that's

2225.98 --> 2232.46
just why yeah anyway enough talk about

2230.15 --> 2236.63
this there is issues with it it is also

2232.46 --> 2240.98
the reason why I just fair

2236.63 --> 2246.59
very rarely even feel the urge now to

2240.98 --> 2250.88
just do anything you know mostly I don't

2246.59 --> 2253.07
know what I find actual the idea of

2250.88 --> 2255.05
actually becoming emotionally entangled

2253.07 --> 2257.3300000000004
with a really attractive person the

2255.05 --> 2259.19
person that could be out there that I

2257.33 --> 2260.9
don't even know the face of or that I

2259.19 --> 2264.23
may have seen in the face of somehow

2260.9 --> 2265.94
that just somehow hints at going on in

2264.23 --> 2268.7
my heart that maybe in the future

2265.94 --> 2270.5
somehow that'll work out has that

2268.7 --> 2272.39
happened with my ex - very weird you

2270.5 --> 2280.64
know if I like saw her a year before

2272.39 --> 2283.46
that that was so strange but yeah that

2280.64 --> 2285.98
gives me a hard-on quite literally much

2283.46 --> 2291.92
more now than the freakin disgusting

2291.92 --> 2299.54
like just dumpster pumping basically as

2299.54 --> 2308.39
it for nothing just for temporary

Wow look I'm just gonna talk about any

2352.29 --> 2356.33
subject that's gonna be brought forth

2359.0 --> 2365.55
and hey I didn't get it too descriptive

2362.81 --> 2367.14
which I'm kind of proud of because yeah

2365.55 --> 2369.21
a lot of people could get very

2367.14 --> 2371.31
descriptive and then it would be really

2369.21 --> 2373.05
disgusting I try to avoid that as much

2371.31 --> 2377.36
as possible because it's gonna be

2373.05 --> 2377.36

right well rentee thanks for that but I

2433.72 --> 2441.25
also shared that if you paid any

2437.83 --> 2444.8199999999997
attention that I know at just its

2441.25 --> 2446.77
conditional that's what I said I know

2444.82 --> 2449.98
that you need to have some kind of

2446.77 --> 2453.49
financial backing and I did back in the

2449.98 --> 2457.65
day when I met my ex I know that you

2453.49 --> 2457.6499999999996
don't you know

2465.04 --> 2470.11
that's I don't know some people find it

2467.83 --> 2473.71
so funny that I can be so incredibly

2470.11 --> 2476.6800000000003
confident at times I'm I think I'm

2473.71 --> 2481.96
already pretty confident really I'm just

2476.68 --> 2484.95
very open and that also takes some

2481.96 --> 2488.62
confidence by the way but yeah there's

2484.95 --> 2493.0299999999997
women that like that about me that I

2488.62 --> 2495.33
don't budge openly not secretly down but

2493.03 --> 2497.9100000000003
don't manipulate my way out just

2495.33 --> 2502.42
seemingly like I'm budging and I'm not

2497.91 --> 2506.83
like I've got a small hat tactic no I

2502.42 --> 2510.31
just say no if you can't handle it you

2506.83 --> 2514.5299999999997
can walk away if you stick around you'll

2510.31 --> 2516.91
find that it's worth your time and

2514.53 --> 2519.5800000000004
there's women that actually like that

2516.91 --> 2523.81
because they get sick of how everybody

2519.58 --> 2526.24
else just cooks on everything or are

2523.81 --> 2528.9
completely lost and just don't know what

2526.24 --> 2528.8999999999996

2639.2 --> 2652.16
you do realize that vanity is also

2643.13 --> 2660.6800000000003
considered a sin right just saying yeah

2652.16 --> 2663.2
enough about you yeah oh really well

2660.68 --> 2667.8799999999997
well vanity is not about actually being

2663.2 --> 2672.2799999999997
beautiful it's mostly about being very

2667.88 --> 2675.32
very aware of your beauty and really

2672.28 --> 2679.36
using every little opportunity it

2675.32 --> 2679.36
provides that's vanity

2685.13 --> 2693.08
and also using it as a justification for

2688.44 --> 2695.85
certain types of behavior that you would

2693.08 --> 2698.52
typically not see people that you

2695.85 --> 2700.23
consider less beautiful act like also

2698.52 --> 2709.05
it's also part of vanity

2700.23 --> 2712.2
oh you're a lawyer whoo Wow

2709.05 --> 2719.5800000000004
oh you're certainly a special person

2712.2 --> 2725.609
that's that's obvious Christian lawyer

2719.58 --> 2727.5299999999997
who's incredibly beautiful and and likes

2725.609 --> 2728.25
to dominate people and tell them what to

2727.53 --> 2731.409
do

really just I don't know my feelings

2744.58 --> 2750.8199999999997
kind of tend to lead me in another type

2747.22 --> 2753.72
of direction but that could just be me

2750.82 --> 2753.7200000000003
and my feelings

2756.33 --> 2769.72
right women should be submissive except

2759.43 --> 2772.6299999999997
you right that's not hypocritical at all

2769.72 --> 2775.24
not that's fine anyway I'll stop nagging

2772.63 --> 2778.96
at your weaknesses because you don't

2775.24 --> 2780.85
accept people doing that anyway despite

2778.96 --> 2784.38
you were doing exactly that to other

2780.85 --> 2789.81
people and think you have - right - but

2784.38 --> 2789.81
mm-hmm that's all fine and dandy

2800.079 --> 2805.5890000000004
ah yeah yes of course you don't

2814.97 --> 2833.839
what's that other one vanity is it hold

2822.41 --> 2840.6499999999996
on let me find the right word all right

2833.839 --> 2844.27
pride right I think that's a what you

2840.65 --> 2849.12
just said there is a almost a prime

2844.27 --> 2852.32
example of pride so

2857.16 --> 2871.0699999999997
I don't know it's not looking very good

2859.02 --> 2871.07
at this point though of course it's not

2885.869 --> 2888.859
what's going on

2896.24 --> 2901.16
right Dave Rakhi Agra fort I totally

2899.7 --> 2903.99
agree

2901.16 --> 2906.5
look if I meet a woman and there is some

2903.99 --> 2910.14
kind of sign of Attraction without them

2906.5 --> 2914.13
being all terrified or whatever because

2910.14 --> 2916.5299999999997
that happens too sometimes like that

2914.13 --> 2918.15
they get all shaky because they

2916.53 --> 2922.53
basically have never experienced that

2918.15 --> 2930.869
before with a guy even though they do

2922.53 --> 2932.94
kind of want contact but yeah look when

2930.869 --> 2938.82
I get to know a girl I will ask

2932.94 --> 2940.86
questions and well I was an atheist back

2938.82 --> 2944.67
in the time of my ex in my own way or

2940.86 --> 2948.92
kind of spiritualist and she is an

2944.67 --> 2951.7200000000003
atheist I think pretty sure about it and

2948.92 --> 2953.85
that didn't conflict but now I will

2951.72 --> 2955.9199999999996
definitely come forward and say like yes

2953.85 --> 2959.64
that is this is what I think and I also

2955.92 --> 2963.0
will share my opinion on Church going to

2959.64 --> 2966.06
kind of prevent any anti-christian

2963.0 --> 2968.34
allergy because especially the

2966.06 --> 2972.72
Netherlands there's just a lot of women

2968.34 --> 2976.13
that have that Christianity is overall

2972.72 --> 2976.1299999999997
not very popular here

2977.45 --> 2980.45
although

2987.42 --> 2994.109
although there is kind of a comeback to

2989.7 --> 2997.1699999999996
it but yeah I'll bring up the subjects

2994.109 --> 2998.609
when they get to know them even ask them

2997.17 --> 3001.819
what do you think about getting children

2998.609 --> 3003.44
pretty early on although I won't kind of

3001.819 --> 3007.819
be just asked like what do you think

3003.44 --> 3011.329
about it and if they give like a creepy

3007.819 --> 3014.5099999999998
type response or outright rejection then

3011.329 --> 3016.849
I know it's just like okay unless they

3014.51 --> 3018.98
are responding in that way because they

3016.849 --> 3023.319
think that is what I want to hear and if

3018.98 --> 3026.18
I notice that then I'll ask are you sure

3023.319 --> 3027.619
that is what you feel about it or are

3026.18 --> 3033.74
you just saying that because you think

3027.619 --> 3036.829
that's what I would approve of so yeah

3033.74 --> 3041.75
look in my mind how these things

3036.829 --> 3046.19
unroll it's not a big issue you know

3041.75 --> 3048.589
back say 10 years ago even still but

3046.19 --> 3050.2400000000002
especially 20 years ago I would have so

3048.589 --> 3052.22
much on my mind that I would just be

3050.24 --> 3055.549
afraid to share and I'd be keeping

3052.22 --> 3061.3089999999997
almost everything to myself and then

3055.549 --> 3063.2889999999998
later much later figure out figure out

3061.309 --> 3065.7200000000003
the answers to the questions that I had

3063.289 --> 3067.4900000000002
because I was just too afraid to show

3065.72 --> 3076.9599999999996
who I really was because I thought that

3067.49 --> 3076.9599999999996
would scare off a lot of women but

3077.209 --> 3082.8289999999997
but you know I've greatly developed and

3080.429 --> 3086.819
got control over certain tendencies of

3082.829 --> 3088.199
myself and my moods a lot more much more

3086.819 --> 3092.7889999999998
discipline and I got so much more

3088.199 --> 3095.969
insight and things I can do and social

3092.789 --> 3105.239
functions in a relation that I can

3095.969 --> 3107.969
fulfill so yeah even with my ex I damn

3105.239 --> 3112.259
well crushed it most of it first two

3107.969 --> 3114.66
years absolutely I was crushing it I was

3112.259 --> 3116.759
super confident I was very creative and

3114.66 --> 3119.459
I would be the guy that would be just

3116.759 --> 3122.5190000000002
feeling great all the time and then

3119.459 --> 3127.3799999999997
suddenly a situation happened with

3122.519 --> 3130.5589999999997
whatever with my ex's work or with

3127.38 --> 3133.589
friends circle or whatever and I would

3130.559 --> 3135.509
just step up and fix it I will just step

3133.589 --> 3137.729
up to the plate as an alpha and just

3135.509 --> 3142.16
take control and do it and I would loved

3137.729 --> 3146.6989999999996
it that was awesome

3142.16 --> 3149.5989999999997
but yeah after that things happened got

3146.699 --> 3153.299
jumbled up my ex got dissatisfied and

3149.599 --> 3156.2690000000002
then I lost my confidence because the

3153.299 --> 3161.069
system that was there just she didn't

3156.269 --> 3163.41
feed it anymore and then I started to

3161.069 --> 3165.989
disintegrate and didn't really know an

3163.41 --> 3169.259
alternative stance to bloom up again so

3165.989 --> 3174.829
I kind of just like lost control of the

3169.259 --> 3178.549
situation it was really depressing and

3174.829 --> 3182.369
right but up until the moment when the

3178.549 --> 3184.799
the contract the spiritual contract that

3182.369 --> 3186.449
we had when we engaged in a relationship

3184.799 --> 3192.15
when that was still everything in place

3186.449 --> 3195.79
I was absolutely smashing it I I felt

3192.15 --> 3201.13
like a king with a queen

3195.79 --> 3201.13
and we definitely looked like it

3213.59 --> 3217.81
you're asking me now toady

3224.74 --> 3232.5989999999997
right well toady okay look well I can

3230.14 --> 3236.65
talk about no important as I kind of did

3232.599 --> 3239.7400000000002
right before this as for a family life

3236.65 --> 3242.2000000000003
well I unfortunately can only give you

3239.74 --> 3245.589
secondhand information and reflections

3242.2 --> 3250.18
upon how things were with between my

3245.589 --> 3252.7
parents and because I did pay a lot of

3250.18 --> 3254.8489999999997
attention even we did kind of fulfill a

3252.7 --> 3259.839
therapists function at one point

3254.849 --> 3261.9100000000003
actively like very actively was quite a

3259.839 --> 3264.46
challenge and it worked for the time

3261.91 --> 3269.02
being also led to them being able to

3264.46 --> 3276.28
decide to actually break up because it

3269.02 --> 3278.589
was not going anywhere anyway I have

3276.28 --> 3281.2900000000004
reflections upon that but I just have

3278.589 --> 3283.24
not I don't have a family of mind I kind

3281.29 --> 3285.25
of know what could happen like what

3283.24 --> 3287.7599999999998
could happen once I get a kid I could

3285.25 --> 3290.17
just I'll just go berserk with energy

3287.76 --> 3293.71
Owen Benjamin also described is I know

3290.17 --> 3296.7400000000002
that's gonna happen I know it that's

3293.71 --> 3302.4700000000003
almost why I wanted so much because I

3296.74 --> 3305.89
need that in order to just burst get

3302.47 --> 3308.2599999999998
things going and it'll also make me take

3305.89 --> 3310.45
a lot more risk suddenly something

3308.26 --> 3313.9
that's totally against my regular habit

3310.45 --> 3317.109
of doing I know it'll do that it'll

3313.9 --> 3319.48
force me to do that like if I would

3317.109 --> 3322.06
stand still during a that experience it

3319.48 --> 3324.67
would probably physically kill me it

3322.06 --> 3327.46
would literally just choke me and just

3324.67 --> 3331.03
gave me a heart attack or something if I

3327.46 --> 3333.089
didn't just utilize it every chance I

3331.03 --> 3333.0890000000004
get

3333.15 --> 3337.17
yeah stop it

3342.82 --> 3349.59
you don't need to do that I am NOT

3346.18 --> 3358.7799999999997
asking you for help stop it

3349.59 --> 3360.55
keep your tentacles away I'm not asking

3358.78 --> 3365.4700000000003
for advice this is not a plea of

3360.55 --> 3368.0800000000004
desperation okay yeah to be clear people

3365.47 --> 3371.41
trolls out there and Trish Blythe this

3368.08 --> 3374.7999999999997
all is not a plea of desperation I'm

3371.41 --> 3377.08
simply sharing what I know what the

3374.8 --> 3380.77
range of my knowledge is and how

3377.08 --> 3382.9
valuable even from an outside from a

3380.77 --> 3386.71
secondhand perspective the knowledge

3382.9 --> 3388.81
that I do have still can be okay and I

3386.71 --> 3392.23
do pay a lot of attention I'm preparing

3388.81 --> 3397.63
myself spiritually to go to that stage

3392.23 --> 3400.72
have been for a while this is not a pity

3397.63 --> 3403.06
plea I don't need your pity if anything

3400.72 --> 3406.72
I need financial support I don't need oh

3403.06 --> 3413.43
oh all can help you all poor I don't

3406.72 --> 3413.43
need that I don't want that okay

3419.45 --> 3424.21
I don't want that stop it

3428.78 --> 3433.9100000000003
I can talk about a lot of things but I'm

3431.36 --> 3437.96
not gonna be petty playing like that

3433.91 --> 3441.77
right I know where I am how I got here

3437.96 --> 3447.07
what I can do where I will go where the

3441.77 --> 3451.97
places are that I will inevitably go and

3447.07 --> 3456.17
this is just a stage and in the sense a

3451.97 --> 3459.29
stage of my life not as in an acting

3456.17 --> 3463.15
stage although yeah life is but a stage

3459.29 --> 3465.59
and you're an actor in it that why not
