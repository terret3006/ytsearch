7.92 --> 37.74
[Music]

59.42 --> 64.159

much appreciated you can always use it

92.939 --> 97.439
so

94.5 --> 100.88
the weather today well as it was

97.439 --> 100.88
predicted it's

102.42 --> 107.82000000000001
perfectly clear

104.64 --> 112.32
guys I mean perfect

107.82 --> 115.67999999999999
been outside there's literally not one

112.32 --> 118.38
Trail a bit of haze

115.68 --> 120.96000000000001
or cloud in the sky to be spotted

118.38 --> 122.88
anywhere

120.96 --> 125.219
so yeah

122.88 --> 129.619
kind of weird

125.219 --> 129.619
to have it be that clear all of a sudden

132.72 --> 137.459
and yeah the sun is nice and bright

134.879 --> 141.14
unfortunately though also on top of that

137.459 --> 141.14000000000001
there is like this wind

141.36 --> 146.70000000000002
that's more going now than it has been

143.7 --> 150.06
last few days and that wind is kind of

146.7 --> 151.92
cold I mean it's not pleasant standing

150.06 --> 155.52
outside

151.92 --> 159.17999999999998
I mean you'd need a jacket and uh

155.52 --> 162.72
and a scarf and and such because it is

159.18 --> 164.78
with the wind it's it's kind of cold

162.72 --> 167.819
but yeah with the sun

164.78 --> 169.14000000000001
I mean it must be ideal now to like sit

167.819 --> 171.54
there

169.14 --> 175.099
behind the window and just absorb all

171.54 --> 175.099
that sun without the wind

176.099 --> 181.57999999999998
right so

178.14 --> 181.57999999999998
totally beautiful day

183.5 --> 187.58
and I did actually go to bed kind of

186.3 --> 190.92000000000002
early

187.58 --> 194.04000000000002
so I was up

190.92 --> 196.879
early to enjoy that

194.04 --> 196.879
and I have

197.099 --> 205.2
all right so hello Ellis G first in chat

200.879 --> 211.79999999999998
good to see you PJ CNET good to see you

205.2 --> 211.79999999999998
it is Monday the 14th of November 2022

218.099 --> 221.06
foreign

221.879 --> 226.319
it's weird I do kind of feel a little

224.22 --> 228.42
bit sleepy

226.319 --> 230.159
but it's not because I'm not rested or

228.42 --> 231.11999999999998
anything it I think it has to do with

230.159 --> 233.64
the weather

231.12 --> 236.18
like with that wind

233.64 --> 236.17999999999998
it's weird

237.299 --> 242.48000000000002
but yeah I guess slept absolutely fine

243.04 --> 246.42999999999998
[Music]

247.44 --> 252.439
it's all an overcast with the rain over

249.599 --> 252.439
here oh okay

252.9 --> 257.06
guess in England you're not so lucky

258.299 --> 265.69899999999996
but it's really beautiful out here

260.39 --> 265.699
[Music]

265.74 --> 270.419
but yeah it's 10 degrees Celsius I

268.68 --> 274.56
wonder

270.419 --> 277.62
it's been the coldest has been thus far

274.56 --> 279.6
is Autumn although the forecast says

277.62 --> 281.1
that by next weekend it's gonna fall

279.6 --> 284.06
even below

281.1 --> 284.06
10 degrees

284.419 --> 287.71999999999997
we'll see

289.82 --> 298.09999999999997
a tominoid

292.919 --> 298.09999999999997
turret 3006 good to see you

299.76 --> 302.959
[Music]

307.04 --> 311.759
opposite when they're down here okay

310.49 --> 313.74
[Music]

311.759 --> 317.18
it's like springtime over there right

313.74 --> 317.18
you're in the middle of it

318.479 --> 321.139
all right

321.24 --> 326.46000000000004
anyway

322.46 --> 330.68
[Music]

326.46 --> 330.68
yeah yesterday's show was pretty awesome

336.38 --> 343.199
I finished watching oh Benjamin

339.84 --> 345.0
and I did indeed come upon the hilarious

343.199 --> 348.96000000000004
Jew song

345.0 --> 353.3
which was it was really that funny so

348.96 --> 353.29999999999995
thanks for the heads up on that

354.3 --> 357.3
uh

358.74 --> 364.52
all right

360.9 --> 364.52
flat side went live again

364.68 --> 369.66
but yeah I did not

367.02 --> 372.44
catch it

369.66 --> 372.44
uh

375.78 --> 384.29999999999995
I was watching some Netflix yesterday

378.9 --> 386.88
like a really really silly old movie

384.3 --> 388.8
that is like I mean that thing is

386.88 --> 392.4
basically soft porn

388.8 --> 394.86
from the 70s it's just I didn't expect

392.4 --> 397.25899999999996
that it didn't even say like sexual or

394.86 --> 400.28000000000003
anything in like this sub description so

397.259 --> 404.34000000000003
I was like what okay

400.28 --> 406.79999999999995
spaced out I mean it's like the ultimate

404.34 --> 408.78
alien women

406.8 --> 411.3
basically

408.78 --> 414.0
kidnap people

411.3 --> 415.34000000000003
and they don't know what sex is I mean

414.0 --> 417.479
it's

415.34 --> 420.65999999999997
it's so

417.479 --> 421.86
so typical and it's like a blast through

420.66 --> 424.199
the past

421.86 --> 427.44
for me to see that it's like oh it's so

424.199 --> 429.41900000000004
it's so stupid but it's so funny

427.44 --> 433.639
and it did end properly with basically

429.419 --> 433.639
the ship just blowing up at the end

438.72 --> 443.699
it is like the ultimate Boomer squirt

441.66 --> 446.34000000000003
movie I mean seriously if you want to

443.699 --> 450.62
have like a stereotypical Boomer squirt

446.34 --> 452.34
movie spaced out is it

450.62 --> 455.22
hysterical

452.34 --> 457.52
right but I yeah that that's not like

455.22 --> 457.52000000000004
the

458.099 --> 464.34
oh yeah I was watching some other

461.4 --> 466.73999999999995
like some weird miniseries Transformers

464.34 --> 468.96
related I have never seen before where

466.74 --> 471.36
it was completely 3D animated and it

468.96 --> 474.06
looked really good and it was just

471.36 --> 476.40000000000003
really impressed by it

474.06 --> 479.759
and yeah it's like this mini series of

476.4 --> 483.23999999999995
five episodes and

479.759 --> 487.319
it has like the continues

483.24 --> 488.759
it is like strictly part of the

487.319 --> 491.639
continuity

488.759 --> 495.06
of the old Transformer series with the

491.639 --> 498.96000000000004
same looks the same things that happen

495.06 --> 501.12
in it it so I was like wow

498.96 --> 503.63899999999995
that's really impressive it was

501.12 --> 506.28000000000003
classified under anime but

503.639 --> 509.759
didn't really get that

506.28 --> 513.4789999999999
so I'm like halfway through that

509.759 --> 515.64
I said they call again uh

513.479 --> 518.399
yeah and it was basically like a weird

515.64 --> 521.279
crossover between beast wars and the old

518.399 --> 524.94
G1 Transformers

521.279 --> 526.98
but all 3D animated like Beast Wars so

524.94 --> 531.5400000000001
it was just weird yeah

526.98 --> 536.779
but very interesting anyway hello

531.54 --> 536.779
moon buggy and dank good to see you both

537.779 --> 544.16
Jim Bob did a great song about geometria

541.56 --> 544.16
could be

546.899 --> 551.42
I think I may have seen that one but

548.82 --> 554.47
yeah that's from some time ago

551.42 --> 554.4699999999999
[Music]

557.66 --> 563.26
Warlords of Atlantis vanished from

560.7 --> 564.899
Netflix what

563.26 --> 568.58
[Music]

564.899 --> 568.58
what the [ __ ]

569.76 --> 573.24
okay

570.46 --> 575.82
[Music]

573.24 --> 579.42
it might just not be available for your

575.82 --> 584.36
country though I mean there is weird UK

579.42 --> 584.36
US Europe region stuff

585.18 --> 589.16
oh it has been by the way

589.2 --> 594.08
right let me check if it's still there

591.6 --> 594.08
for me

595.08 --> 602.339
when you do an action figure

598.1 --> 605.65
I put you on mute your piece of [ __ ]

602.339 --> 611.1600000000001
I hate it when it does that

605.65 --> 614.3389999999999
[Music]

611.16 --> 617.0
Warlords no it's still here

614.339 --> 617.0
foreign

617.64 --> 623.22
oh by the way if you want it's kind of

621.06 --> 625.14
funny I didn't even mention it

623.22 --> 626.88
but there was another movie also

625.14 --> 630.48
involving Atlantis that I watched before

626.88 --> 633.899
that called Inland Atlantis Inferno but

630.48 --> 637.08
that one is like the shittiest possible

633.899 --> 639.06
version of sort of the same movie I mean

637.08 --> 641.64
it's really stupid that's why I didn't

639.06 --> 643.38
even mention it but then what Warlords

641.64 --> 646.86
of Atlantis and it's like a really

643.38 --> 648.12
hysterical contrast

646.86 --> 650.519
okay

648.12 --> 653.82
but just Atlantis in front is just like

650.519 --> 655.5600000000001
a really dumb dumb dumb action movie

653.82 --> 658.5
this

655.56 --> 660.54
it's like barely any plot it's it's just

658.5 --> 663.54
stuff happens and then more stuff

660.54 --> 668.16
happens and people get shot and

663.54 --> 670.8
fire fire fire bombs and kind of dumb

668.16 --> 672.66
dumb dumb ass action movie so but yeah

670.8 --> 674.279
Warlords of Atlanta I can still see it

672.66 --> 678.24
right here

674.279 --> 680.42
on Netflix so that might be original for

678.24 --> 680.42
you

680.579 --> 684.92
right let me show you

688.5 --> 691.279
uh

698.519 --> 703.4590000000001
right so yeah it's still there

703.74 --> 709.82
in search bar and this is what came out

707.22 --> 709.82
so

715.52 --> 719.64
[Music]

717.72 --> 722.84
system

719.64 --> 722.84
[Music]

724.32 --> 728.7600000000001
VPN

726.71 --> 732.32
[Music]

728.76 --> 732.3199999999999
yeah that doesn't make any sense

733.32 --> 738.9590000000001
you can't use a VPN on a prescription

736.44 --> 742.86
based system

738.959 --> 745.68
that doesn't work did you see that

742.86 --> 748.62
but look if you want to watch that movie

745.68 --> 750.06
I'll bet you you can just download it I

748.62 --> 754.16
mean

750.06 --> 754.16
it's like 46 years old

757.74 --> 763.2
you could probably buy it for like two

761.1 --> 766.38
two euros

763.2 --> 770.63
or two pounds at some secondhand store

766.38 --> 786.299
on a dve it's really old anyway

770.63 --> 786.299
[Music]

786.3 --> 793.6899999999999
foreign

787.66 --> 793.6899999999999
[Music]

794.04 --> 799.0999999999999
so yeah that was pretty much it for my

796.38 --> 799.1
activity yesterday

799.92 --> 803.24
watching some of that

810.32 --> 816.12
I'm still gonna find out about that

813.839 --> 819.24
silly movie it's based out because I

816.12 --> 822.12
think like pretty prominent actor is in

819.24 --> 824.399
there when he's still very young

822.12 --> 826.92
I mean he looked like the same guy that

824.399 --> 829.56
played the main character in Jacob's

826.92 --> 834.3199999999999
Ladder but

829.56 --> 834.3199999999999
I tried IMDb check that now

835.08 --> 838.269
[Music]

841.08 --> 846.6700000000001
[Music]

850.459 --> 855.0
low budget alien

859.56 --> 863.76
um

861.36 --> 867.2
I mean that picture of the cover is like

863.76 --> 867.2
perfect for it but anyway

867.36 --> 871.399
Berry Strokes is that

872.04 --> 874.639
no

875.04 --> 880.079
it's not the guy these are all

877.92 --> 882.86
it's all 70s stuff

880.079 --> 882.8599999999999
uh

891.24 --> 897.1800000000001
where's the freaking pictures

894.18 --> 897.18
foreign

904.019 --> 910.639
well not all of them anyway

906.3 --> 910.639
I don't know maybe it's it's not that

911.16 --> 913.399
director

913.74 --> 917.1800000000001
it just really looked like him

917.399 --> 921.26
like if he were younger

935.399 --> 941.279
okay well that's not him because he

938.639 --> 943.399
literally only appeared in that movie

941.279 --> 943.399
yeah

944.899 --> 948.079
come on

958.38 --> 963.4399999999999
oh

959.459 --> 963.4399999999999
right I got the wrong character

963.48 --> 968.04
ah

965.699 --> 969.5799999999999
wait what

968.04 --> 972.66
oh

969.58 --> 974.82
[Music]

972.66 --> 978.3199999999999
wait is that the last movie and a

974.82 --> 978.32
parenting what the

979.5 --> 982.1
foreign

984.3 --> 989.54
guy did apparently appear in a whole

986.82 --> 989.5400000000001
bunch of stuff

990.24 --> 994.38
but it doesn't seem

992.519 --> 997.259
the character

994.38 --> 1000.759
or the actor that I thought he was right

997.259 --> 1000.759
okay so never mind

1003.74 --> 1006.759
sorry about that

1007.579 --> 1014.079
hey PG crucial good to see you

1010.6 --> 1014.0790000000001
mtrc hello

1023.74 --> 1027.919
[Music]

1025.16 --> 1031.28
yeah tell them when I do I know

1027.919 --> 1034.2800000000002
all Transformers the movie yeah because

1031.28 --> 1037.959
it was super impactful I mean that movie

1034.28 --> 1037.959
was effectively like

1038.0 --> 1043.4
in a way sort of

1040.52 --> 1046.04
it was meant for kids that were older

1043.4 --> 1048.5590000000002
not like six and eight

1046.04 --> 1051.2
because it was kind of a serious war

1048.559 --> 1053.299
movie in a way which is well

1051.2 --> 1057.38
Transformers is just not really like

1053.299 --> 1059.78
that it's it's more like play War

1057.38 --> 1062.24
because it's like downgraded for kids

1059.78 --> 1065.059
but yeah man Transformers the movie when

1062.24 --> 1066.2
I first saw that I cried the [ __ ] out of

1065.059 --> 1068.8999999999999
it

1066.2 --> 1072.38
but like the entire movie I was like

1068.9 --> 1075.14
this is so impressive I think I saw it

1072.38 --> 1078.94
when I was like eight

1075.14 --> 1078.94
or something on the TV

1079.46 --> 1084.98
and I recorded it

1082.76 --> 1087.74
on that tape and I like kept that tape

1084.98 --> 1090.14
for 10 years watched it a lot because

1087.74 --> 1092.6
that movie is so freaking impressive I

1090.14 --> 1095.8600000000001
mean it really is it's still really

1092.6 --> 1095.86
impressive right now

1105.679 --> 1110.26
I still have it on DVD ah there you go

1111.14 --> 1115.1000000000001
all right

1112.46 --> 1117.799
do the film

1115.1 --> 1120.02
but yeah the cover sucks of this thing

1117.799 --> 1124.0
but I'm just really happy to have this

1120.02 --> 1124.0
movie because it is really awesome

1141.98 --> 1146.299
foreign

1143.2 --> 1149.0
and like it was a crazy move too because

1146.299 --> 1151.34
it was basically the franchise

1149.0 --> 1154.22
in that moment basically kind of broke

1151.34 --> 1156.02
out of their format like having all

1154.22 --> 1158.0
these familiar characters just get

1156.02 --> 1161.0
killed right in front of your face while

1158.0 --> 1163.4
they never get killed in the series ever

1161.0 --> 1165.94
nobody does they just kind of disappear

1163.4 --> 1165.94
or something

1168.2 --> 1174.22
anyway

1170.33 --> 1174.22

thanks for popping by

1184.7 --> 1187.78
e have a good working day

1189.5 --> 1194.84
I'd like to Transformers boost sequels

1192.2 --> 1196.82
what are you talking about

1194.84 --> 1200.059
we're not talking about the Michael Bay

1196.82 --> 1202.82
movies future cruising

1200.059 --> 1205.059
there's no sequels of Transformers the

1202.82 --> 1205.059
movie

1206.299 --> 1211.059
there's just the the third season

1211.58 --> 1216.1399999999999
right the carnological order is you have

1213.679 --> 1217.8200000000002
season one season two then you have the

1216.14 --> 1220.539
movie then you have season three which

1217.82 --> 1220.539
is mostly in

1221.539 --> 1227.679
in yeah in space other planets and [ __ ]

1234.02 --> 1239.48
have I seen the movie Bumblebee yeah no

1236.419 --> 1242.0
bumblebee was pretty good for a Michael

1239.48 --> 1244.3600000000001
Bay Transformer film that is yeah I

1242.0 --> 1244.36
liked it

1245.539 --> 1251.48
it's one of the few Transformers Michael

1248.9 --> 1253.66
Bay films where I just don't get moments

1251.48 --> 1257.24
where I want to throw up

1253.66 --> 1269.5790000000002
which all of the others do kinda

1257.24 --> 1269.579
[Music]

1275.98 --> 1279.98
okay mtrc

1289.539 --> 1294.34
well that sounds totally ridiculous

1294.8 --> 1298.5
[Music]

1298.88 --> 1304.88
I mean you really think mtrc that I

1302.059 --> 1306.86
can't control the spirit of the objects

1304.88 --> 1310.3600000000001
in my room

1306.86 --> 1310.36
they know who's boss

1310.4 --> 1316.2800000000002
if any bickering broke out between any

1312.98 --> 1318.44
of the objects here you know I will like

1316.28 --> 1320.6589999999999
get get them falling in line very

1318.44 --> 1323.419
quickly

1320.659 --> 1327.5590000000002
so your dream is kind of downplaying me

1323.419 --> 1327.5590000000002
I'd say mtrc

1329.46 --> 1332.68
[Music]

1335.0 --> 1342.08
but I mean is having dreams about me

1338.78 --> 1344.8999999999999
doing the show now a thing with you guys

1342.08 --> 1348.6999999999998
that is weird

1344.9 --> 1348.7
I don't have those dreams

1364.05 --> 1367.23
[Music]

1375.74 --> 1378.34
oh

1384.38 --> 1389.1200000000001
you're happy just seen that yeah I know

1386.24 --> 1390.86
the originals are collector's items

1389.12 --> 1393.559
but

1390.86 --> 1396.08
if you look out there carefully you will

1393.559 --> 1399.2
find that there is like high grade

1396.08 --> 1402.26
quality much better Transformers

1399.2 --> 1404.419
versions like redesigns

1402.26 --> 1407.0
of the same thing

1404.419 --> 1410.539
where instead of like cheap ass robots

1407.0 --> 1413.0
with arms that's actually like really

1410.539 --> 1416.24
dynamic posable

1413.0 --> 1417.98
figurines they're kind of expensive and

1416.24 --> 1420.38
I'm not just talking about the Michael

1417.98 --> 1421.88
Bay Transformer there's like classic

1420.38 --> 1425.72
style

1421.88 --> 1428.72
that look amazing so yeah the classics

1425.72 --> 1432.98
they're like collectors value but

1428.72 --> 1434.5
there's literally just really high tech

1432.98 --> 1437.48
yeah

1434.5 --> 1439.28
redesigns of a much higher quality of

1437.48 --> 1441.8600000000001
basically the same Transformers where

1439.28 --> 1444.3799999999999
they really do look like the

1441.86 --> 1447.039
Transformers from the cartoon and [ __ ]

1444.38 --> 1447.0390000000002
so

1448.7 --> 1452.419
I mean I'd rather have those if you ask

1451.159 --> 1455.419
me

1452.419 --> 1457.3400000000001
would be big pretty badass figurines to

1455.419 --> 1460.64
have

1457.34 --> 1462.4399999999998
you can like really easily pose them and

1460.64 --> 1463.44
everything

1462.44 --> 1468.02
anyway

1463.44 --> 1470.48
[Music]

1468.02 --> 1471.76
I'd like one of those really heavy

1470.48 --> 1475.039
high-tech

1471.76 --> 1476.0
Optimus Prime Transformers like the old

1475.039 --> 1478.28
red

1476.0 --> 1482.08
truck Style

1478.28 --> 1482.08
I would really like one of those

1485.659 --> 1491.3600000000001
I never had an Optimus Prime Transformer

1489.2 --> 1494.6000000000001
I had a lot of Transformers but I never

1491.36 --> 1498.08
got my hands on Optimus Prime

1494.6 --> 1500.84
and I did actually like go out even to

1498.08 --> 1503.02
other towns to look for them in toy

1500.84 --> 1503.02
stores

1503.2 --> 1509.659
I remember that like when I was a kid

1507.44 --> 1512.72
I really laughed I really love

1509.659 --> 1514.64
Transformers back then and Legos both

1512.72 --> 1517.88
pretty much

1514.64 --> 1519.919
Legos kept my love for Lagos kept

1517.88 --> 1521.6000000000001
hanging around a lot longer though I

1519.919 --> 1525.0200000000002
mean Transformers

1521.6 --> 1527.84
my interest kind of died

1525.02 --> 1529.76
like when I entered my teens

1527.84 --> 1532.9399999999998
Legos

1529.76 --> 1535.72
die down a little but I just did so much

1532.94 --> 1535.72
more with that

1536.48 --> 1539.919
all right anyways

1542.299 --> 1547.6399999999999
foreign

1543.3 --> 1547.6399999999999
[Music]

1550.48 --> 1558.08
Hopper okay so you got an insecticon

1555.02 --> 1561.44
that's cool I mean those are like really

1558.08 --> 1565.1789999999999
awesome Transformers the insecticons

1561.44 --> 1565.179
I never had an insecticon before

1571.64 --> 1577.4
I did have a lot of like uh

1574.48 --> 1579.38
combo Transformers

1577.4 --> 1582.38
like I had all the aerial Bots

1579.38 --> 1585.22
stunticons

1582.38 --> 1585.22
uh

1585.559 --> 1591.26
then from like the later Styles and all

1588.86 --> 1593.84
that I don't even remember the name was

1591.26 --> 1595.82
it again the Predacons

1593.84 --> 1598.82
uh

1595.82 --> 1598.82
right

1599.659 --> 1605.779
no never had Dinobots

1603.02 --> 1608.779
really did want them though

1605.779 --> 1608.779
foreign

1628.58 --> 1634.52
by the way I still have them but a lot

1632.179 --> 1637.52
of it is kind of broken

1634.52 --> 1640.34
and like worn and [ __ ] but I still have

1637.52 --> 1642.9189999999999
like like a whole box full of that [ __ ]

1640.34 --> 1645.1999999999998
it's in my storage

1642.919 --> 1648.38
in a way I kind of like want to get rid

1645.2 --> 1650.299
of it and like I don't know

1648.38 --> 1652.46
sell them to somebody that actually

1650.299 --> 1654.5
cares and is like also willing to try

1652.46 --> 1656.24
and restore some of it because it's like

1654.5 --> 1658.31
really kind of a waste that some of it

1656.24 --> 1662.46
is broken

1658.31 --> 1662.46
[Music]

1676.87 --> 1680.08
[Music]

1680.98 --> 1686.84
as one trust yeah I remember that mtrc

1687.26 --> 1690.26
foreign

1705.21 --> 1711.26
[Music]

1716.36 --> 1719.55
[Music]

1724.7 --> 1730.65
foreign

1727.36 --> 1730.6499999999999
[Music]

1734.299 --> 1738.62
but it was kind of funny because

1736.159 --> 1740.72
yesterday on my show I had this little

1738.62 --> 1743.9599999999998
moment where

1740.72 --> 1748.6000000000001
remember I was trying to figure out what

1743.96 --> 1748.6000000000001
Transformer would QE be

1757.159 --> 1762.74
so that kind of made me click on on that

1759.74 --> 1765.5
but yeah that little mini Siri 3D

1762.74 --> 1768.86
animated looked really good actually so

1765.5 --> 1771.799
far I'm actually impressed

1768.86 --> 1773.9599999999998
and it's like kind of holding up like to

1771.799 --> 1778.46
the original lore as well

1773.96 --> 1781.82
which is like wow in this age things

1778.46 --> 1784.82
actually holding up to the original lore

1781.82 --> 1787.039
that's almost unheard of

1784.82 --> 1789.4399999999998
because it's so freaking trendy to take

1787.039 --> 1792.2
some old franchise and say yeah we're

1789.44 --> 1794.539
gonna do redo it but it's old people

1792.2 --> 1796.94
don't want to own so we're gonna

1794.539 --> 1799.279
completely rearrange it into something

1796.94 --> 1801.6200000000001
completely different because I'm special

1799.279 --> 1804.38
and you'll like me right with a

1801.62 --> 1806.2399999999998
completely rape the original franchise

1804.38 --> 1808.7
and turn it into something completely

1806.24 --> 1810.74
different because that's what you want

1808.7 --> 1812.24
right

1810.74 --> 1816.08
yeah

1812.24 --> 1818.26
well this particular series did not do

1816.08 --> 1818.26
that

1818.419 --> 1823.5200000000002
at all it was very loyal to the original

1821.0 --> 1827.559
Transformer lore

1823.52 --> 1827.559
and I liked it so far

1833.96 --> 1839.1200000000001
should be in everything okay well

1836.72 --> 1841.64
there's two of them

1839.12 --> 1844.399
in that mini series

1841.64 --> 1846.74
because yeah well

1844.399 --> 1849.4399999999998
there the Beast Wars are there too and

1846.74 --> 1853.7
there's literally two Dino

1849.44 --> 1856.299
yeah two dino robots in there so

1853.7 --> 1856.299
anyway

1857.02 --> 1860.62
Linux good to see you

1875.419 --> 1879.679
all right

1877.82 --> 1882.82
yeah what was I

1879.679 --> 1882.8200000000002
what was it called again

1883.6 --> 1892.34
Transformers War

1886.88 --> 1896.1200000000001
for Cybertron Kingdom Halo very weird

1892.34 --> 1898.1589999999999
weird title but that's what it's called

1896.12 --> 1900.8799999999999
that's what I'm watching right now and

1898.159 --> 1903.6200000000001
I'm very impressed

1900.88 --> 1906.0800000000002
on Netflix

1903.62 --> 1908.299
it's really really hard to find

1906.08 --> 1910.539
something actually good on Netflix by

1908.299 --> 1910.539
the way

1911.12 --> 1915.8799999999999
you have to browse through all the

1913.1 --> 1915.8799999999999
garbage first

1927.44 --> 1932.2
one of the games what are you talking

1929.96 --> 1932.2
about

1948.159 --> 1956.38
of all Trump that's old

1952.7 --> 1956.38
but yeah I remember Voltron

1956.96 --> 1962.059
my first contact with Voltron was like

1959.779 --> 1965.2
this weird comic book that my my brother

1962.059 --> 1965.2
picked up somewhere

1967.279 --> 1971.659
that comic book fascinated the [ __ ] out

1970.34 --> 1974.059
of me

1971.659 --> 1976.7600000000002
as a kid

1974.059 --> 1980.12
then later much much later I actually

1976.76 --> 1984.62
saw the Voltron cartoon series and it

1980.12 --> 1987.6799999999998
was [ __ ] lame and I mean lame

1984.62 --> 1987.6799999999998
[Music]

1987.74 --> 1993.6200000000001
but the idea seemed pretty interesting

1990.98 --> 1994.6
like the whole thing I don't know it's a

1993.62 --> 1998.9599999999998
weird old Relic

1994.6 --> 2000.6
[Music]

1998.96 --> 2003.78
remember

2000.6 --> 2006.34
whatever I can't watch that

2003.78 --> 2009.34

2006.34 --> 2009.34

2013.62 --> 2018.6
besides

2015.34 --> 2018.6
they don't belong there

2020.559 --> 2027.399
yeah the real Battle Star Galactica

2023.34 --> 2029.9189999999999
people play disco music had silly

2027.399 --> 2032.86
disco-like costumes on and played

2029.919 --> 2035.0800000000002
basketball okay that's what they did in

2032.86 --> 2038.1589999999999
Battlestar they didn't have giant Mech

2035.08 --> 2038.1589999999999
robots and [ __ ]

2040.179 --> 2044.039

2050.619 --> 2056.139

2053.679 --> 2058.359
toys again well no not I'm trying not to

2056.139 --> 2060.58
I but I just watched something and now

2058.359 --> 2062.74
everybody's rolling out all their [ __ ]

2060.58 --> 2065.7999999999997
again

2062.74 --> 2069.899
which is fine but no I wasn't planning

2065.8 --> 2069.8990000000003
to talk about toys all day long no

2070.48 --> 2073.02
before

[Music]

2089.98 --> 2094.2400000000002
right do you have anything I could talk

2091.899 --> 2096.8199999999997
about I mean I'm open

2094.24 --> 2098.5
uh I did also kind of like wanted to

2096.82 --> 2102.46
mention

2098.5 --> 2103.96
I've been starting to read in the book

2102.46 --> 2107.32
and

2103.96 --> 2108.94
it's quite fascinating and I mean it is

2107.32 --> 2112.06
quite fascinating

2108.94 --> 2114.64
I I really immediately started to notice

2112.06 --> 2115.66
a certain Trend in how he was talking in

2114.64 --> 2118.24
this

2115.66 --> 2120.5789999999997
and really stands out in an immediately

2118.24 --> 2123.04
connected with previous times that I

2120.579 --> 2125.619
remember having read some of it

2123.04 --> 2127.9
some of other rules kind of work and

2125.619 --> 2130.42
that is that the guy

2127.9 --> 2133.48
was like obsessed

2130.42 --> 2136.839
with trying to get misunderstandings out

2133.48 --> 2140.14
of the way and I mean obsessed

2136.839 --> 2142.0
like neurotic about it that it's

2140.14 --> 2144.5789999999997
actually getting kind of annoying at

2142.0 --> 2147.64
times they're just like yeah Rudolph we

2144.579 --> 2149.8
get it stop trying to explain it stop

2147.64 --> 2151.9
trying to assume that everybody reading

2149.8 --> 2154.119
it this is like on purpose gonna

2151.9 --> 2156.4
misinterpret what you're saying

2154.119 --> 2157.48
but that really seems to be like an

2156.4 --> 2160.599
issue

2157.48 --> 2163.48
with Rudolph Steiner is that and it's

2160.599 --> 2165.88
not surprising either

2163.48 --> 2168.82
because in the time when he was actually

2165.88 --> 2170.8
doing his Works which is like super

2168.82 --> 2173.6800000000003
early 20th century

2170.8 --> 2176.38
it really is it's like like the first 10

2173.68 --> 2178.859
this is basically that time that special

2176.38 --> 2178.859
time

2178.9 --> 2183.46
that's when he was doing his work and

2180.76 --> 2186.48
there was like massive amounts of

2183.46 --> 2189.579
stuck up

2186.48 --> 2191.92
institutionalists in science and all

2189.579 --> 2193.599
these fields that were like the only

2191.92 --> 2195.46
thing that those people would be doing

2193.599 --> 2198.1600000000003
is just try to break down everything

2195.46 --> 2199.66
he's like no no it's all worthless

2198.16 --> 2202.839
everything is worthless everybody's

2199.66 --> 2205.7999999999997
crazy because it's not following this

2202.839 --> 2208.359
super rigid contemporary

2205.8 --> 2210.82
way of thinking

2208.359 --> 2213.52
there was like this stuck up rigidness

2210.82 --> 2215.1400000000003
in thinking in general in that time that

2213.52 --> 2217.18
had been building up

2215.14 --> 2220.1189999999997
and that is really what riddlesteiner

2217.18 --> 2223.24
seems to be addressing all the time

2220.119 --> 2226.7200000000003
and I mean constantly it's true like he

2223.24 --> 2228.8799999999997
doesn't just go into the flow and starts

2226.72 --> 2231.5789999999997
talking if they're like the spirit

2228.88 --> 2233.859
mechanics like what I do just it doesn't

2231.579 --> 2237.119
just roll it out no he has to freaking

2233.859 --> 2238.859
preface it with half a page of of

2237.119 --> 2241.859
disclaimers

2238.859 --> 2245.68
Rudolph get the [ __ ] on with it already

2241.859 --> 2248.16
it's not a hundred years ago anymore

2245.68 --> 2251.6189999999997
ah

2248.16 --> 2254.2599999999998
so that's a bit of my frustration but

2251.619 --> 2257.26
the moments where he does actually point

2254.26 --> 2259.96
out ethereal things

2257.26 --> 2261.579
I am astounded

2259.96 --> 2266.46
because

2261.579 --> 2270.82
the way he explains things is exactly

2266.46 --> 2275.079
the way I explain things yeah

2270.82 --> 2277.54
and I mean it's the same way it's the

2275.079 --> 2280.02
same way of talking it's the same it's

2277.54 --> 2280.02
the same

2280.06 --> 2285.06
the man was studying Spirit mechanics

2282.76 --> 2288.5200000000004
and basically had to from scratch

2285.06 --> 2291.46
reinvent the way of pointing that out

2288.52 --> 2294.7599999999998
and thinking about it in the face of

2291.46 --> 2297.579
like a super rigid Society of people

2294.76 --> 2299.44
that literally were all academic

2297.579 --> 2302.32
bastards that the only thing they cared

2299.44 --> 2303.88
about was just being the only one in

2302.32 --> 2306.2200000000003
power

2303.88 --> 2308.56
so that nobody could ever be right

2306.22 --> 2309.5789999999997
unless you basically signed a contract

2308.56 --> 2313.2599999999998
with them

2309.579 --> 2313.26
freaking camera freeze

2315.339 --> 2320.22
so that's what's starting to kind of

2317.56 --> 2320.22
stand out

2320.44 --> 2324.88
yes Professor Phil Bell is still banned

2322.9 --> 2327.4
because he's not gonna apologize he

2324.88 --> 2328.96
doubled down with all caps and [ __ ] and

2327.4 --> 2331.38
he's not coming back I don't want him

2328.96 --> 2331.38
back anymore

2332.079 --> 2336.6400000000003
because he's a piece of [ __ ] that just

2334.359 --> 2340.5
cannot apologize ever

2336.64 --> 2340.5
no matter how wrong he is

2340.859 --> 2344.74
and I'm done

2342.88 --> 2347.38
I'm done with it I don't want him around

2344.74 --> 2349.54
anymore and akumu virus is

2347.38 --> 2351.94
yeah is on watch

2349.54 --> 2353.92
because if he does the same type of [ __ ]

2351.94 --> 2355.18
I'm gonna kick him the [ __ ] out of my

2353.92 --> 2358.119
chat too

2355.18 --> 2360.16
gave him a warning yesterday

2358.119 --> 2362.7400000000002
yes I banned both of his accounts

2360.16 --> 2367.42
because of course as soon as I actually

2362.74 --> 2370.24
kicked him out he had to go the goal to

2367.42 --> 2371.6800000000003
come back with a soccer gun you piece of

2370.24 --> 2375.16

2371.68 --> 2379.3199999999997
you old [ __ ] scumbag

what you had a dream about what is this

2418.359 --> 2422.2
about dreaming about my show this is so

2421.359 --> 2424.24
weird

2422.2 --> 2428.16
since when do people actually dream

2424.24 --> 2428.16
about my show that is just weird

2430.119 --> 2434.26
although it does kind of weirdly ring

2432.4 --> 2436.2400000000002
some Bells concerning my Dark World

2434.26 --> 2437.5600000000004
Vision in which that apparently did

2436.24 --> 2440.6189999999997
happen

2437.56 --> 2443.02
so yeah but it still wears me out even

2440.619 --> 2444.88
from this more timeline based

2443.02 --> 2445.98
contemporary perspective

2444.88 --> 2453.2400000000002
foreign

2445.98 --> 2457.72
[Music]

2453.24 --> 2460.859
Bell got my channel oh really how how

2457.72 --> 2460.859
would he ever do that

2461.14 --> 2464.04
ridiculous

2475.119 --> 2479.6800000000003
today was supposed to be 14 November

2477.7 --> 2483.16
lunch day

2479.68 --> 2485.3799999999997
right you mean the Artemis okay well

2483.16 --> 2487.7999999999997
yeah it's never going off the ground I

2485.38 --> 2487.8
called it

2492.4 --> 2496.32
yeah let's Dream On

2517.96 --> 2522.7200000000003
what what are you saying Tara that makes

2520.119 --> 2522.7200000000003
no sense

2530.339 --> 2536.52
so what it is it supposed to be

2533.079 --> 2536.52
launching today or not

2537.52 --> 2542.44
whatever it's not gonna come off the

2540.22 --> 2544.48
ground so I don't really care all that

2542.44 --> 2548.02
much I mean as soon as that thing

2544.48 --> 2549.76
supposedly does anything warn me until

2548.02 --> 2551.8
that time I'm gonna spend my time

2549.76 --> 2556.0200000000004
focusing on other things

2551.8 --> 2556.02
things that actually happen you see

2557.53 --> 2561.76

2565.839 --> 2570.489

[Music]

2572.73 --> 2576.07
[Music]

2588.64 --> 2593.2599999999998
right but anyway just for the record

2591.339 --> 2596.319
again those who didn't pick up on it

2593.26 --> 2598.5400000000004
Phil Bell is banned

2596.319 --> 2600.579
not just for being an [ __ ] which

2598.54 --> 2603.2799999999997
usually I like to

2600.579 --> 2607.42
like withhold that banning because he

2603.28 --> 2610.2400000000002
does for some reason manage to somewhat

2607.42 --> 2613.6800000000003
behave at times but he was just doubling

2610.24 --> 2616.8999999999996
down on a technical error

2613.68 --> 2620.2
within his field and I find such things

2616.9 --> 2624.099
like an intolerable

2620.2 --> 2626.859
yeah you cannot radiometric date

2624.099 --> 2628.96
the age of our solar system

2626.859 --> 2632.2599999999998
it has not been done

2628.96 --> 2635.079
has not been claimed

2632.26 --> 2637.9
it's [ __ ]

2635.079 --> 2640.54
and I want him to admit that he was

2637.9 --> 2642.099
wrong that it hasn't been done and that

2640.54 --> 2646.3
you can't do it

2642.099 --> 2648.819
that there's theories about what if

2646.3 --> 2651.28
but that it's not feasible

2648.819 --> 2654.099
it wasn't feasible when radiometric

2651.28 --> 2658.0
dating was first being applied

2654.099 --> 2661.98
and it's still not viable now with all

2658.0 --> 2661.98
the developments it has gone through

2662.2 --> 2666.819
and that's what it's about

2664.24 --> 2669.9399999999996
that's why it's bad and until he sends

2666.819 --> 2672.579
me an email with an elaborate apology

2669.94 --> 2676.119
With No Reservations

2672.579 --> 2677.55
he's never gonna come back on my chat

2869.74 --> 2877.6189999999997
saying that Artemis is just for a flyby

2874.119 --> 2877.619
did you seen it really

2880.0 --> 2883.0

2883.54 --> 2886.56
that's it

2907.68 --> 2916.18

[Music]

2945.22 --> 2947.52
foreign

2947.68 --> 2952.8999999999996
yeah but look when they talk about the

2950.14 --> 2955.18
the painful process of poking putting it

2952.9 --> 2956.56
back together what that excuse basically

2955.18 --> 2960.94
means

2956.56 --> 2962.7999999999997
is that the digital technology you see

2960.94 --> 2965.98
it's because they were using like

2962.8 --> 2968.2000000000003
magnetic tapes and [ __ ] for recording

2965.98 --> 2972.94
data

2968.2 --> 2975.2799999999997
of that technology is destroyed and well

2972.94 --> 2976.66
it's kind of stupid to even say it's too

2975.28 --> 2978.28
painful to put it back together again

2976.66 --> 2981.3999999999996
because they just cannot do that because

2978.28 --> 2983.619
the data is destroyed

2981.4 --> 2986.02
so what they're saying is like yeah we

2983.619 --> 2988.7200000000003
lost that data

2986.02 --> 2991.42
and we can't reconstruct that he's

2988.72 --> 2994.24
basically not even saying we can't go

2991.42 --> 2995.92
back to the Moon you see

2994.24 --> 2999.0989999999997
do you understand from that sentence

2995.92 --> 3000.06
that he's not saying we can't go back to

2999.099 --> 3003.7200000000003
the Moon

3000.06 --> 3006.66
just saying like yeah we can't

3003.72 --> 3009.359
we can't get back that that data

3006.66 --> 3011.8799999999997
supposedly because the technology has

3009.359 --> 3014.04
moved on too quickly and it's the old

3011.88 --> 3015.42
recorded stuff has been destroyed so

3014.04 --> 3017.64
they're talking about the digital

3015.42 --> 3022.44
information not the design information

3017.64 --> 3024.96
of course that would be totally [ __ ]

3022.44 --> 3027.599
I mean it's literally right there in a

3024.96 --> 3030.2400000000002
museum and everything so

3027.599 --> 3032.099
so it's a bit tricksy you know when he

3030.24 --> 3034.859
says it's too painful to put the

3032.099 --> 3037.2000000000003
technology back together again he's not

3034.859 --> 3039.48
even saying that you can't we can't go

3037.2 --> 3042.2
back to the Moon he doesn't actually

3039.48 --> 3042.2
mean that

3046.44 --> 3052.579
although he does say we would go back to

3049.559 --> 3055.46
the Moon in a nanosecond he does

3052.579 --> 3057.7200000000003
but his reaction is basically

3055.46 --> 3059.819
non-sequitar to that what he says right

3057.72 --> 3062.22
after that I mean it has nothing to do

3059.819 --> 3066.119
with the ability to go back to the Moon

3062.22 --> 3067.74
it's just the data is lost

3066.119 --> 3069.0
and it's too painful to put it back

3067.74 --> 3071.2799999999997
together

3069.0 --> 3073.7
I mean technically they don't need any

3117.72 --> 3121.02

3166.319 --> 3171.3
yeah

3168.96 --> 3173.88
yeah but to be fair you don't really

3171.3 --> 3175.559
know you know like theoretically what

3173.88 --> 3177.7200000000003
would it look like the Moon is doesn't

3175.559 --> 3181.38
have a lot of atmosphere so maybe things

3177.72 --> 3183.5989999999997
would look smaller

3181.38 --> 3184.5
you didn't seem to see any stars on the

3183.599 --> 3187.1400000000003
moon

3184.5 --> 3189.599
so maybe all the celestial body is

3187.14 --> 3191.819
visible from the alleged Moon surface

3189.599 --> 3194.579
would simply seem smaller because

3191.819 --> 3196.38
there's less atmosphere to amplify them

3194.579 --> 3198.119
or something

3196.38 --> 3201.96
right

3198.119 --> 3204.48
so that has allegedly a reason

3201.96 --> 3206.099
why it seems smaller

3204.48 --> 3208.18
even though it's supposed to be bigger

3206.099 --> 3211.4100000000003
than the moon

3208.18 --> 3211.41
[Music]

3221.94 --> 3226.8
the surface would be blinding well it

3224.339 --> 3231.18
supposedly was seeking star water the

3226.8 --> 3232.8
moon surface was supposedly blinding

3231.18 --> 3234.7999999999997
I mean

3232.8 --> 3239.7000000000003
those

3234.8 --> 3241.8590000000004
astronaut helmets had like reflective

3239.7 --> 3245.22
see through

3241.859 --> 3249.48
glass in the helmet because of that

3245.22 --> 3252.24
because it was blinding

3249.48 --> 3255.38
right they actually had to like dim down

3252.24 --> 3259.5
the light supposedly of the footage

3255.38 --> 3262.579
because it was naturally Overexposed

3259.5 --> 3262.579
because of all the light

3263.94 --> 3268.7400000000002
I had to like anticipate that blah blah

3266.579 --> 3270.6600000000003
I'm sorry I'm sorry for going so long

3268.74 --> 3273.1189999999997
with the presupposition but there is

3270.66 --> 3274.98
literally a reason for any freaking

3273.119 --> 3277.559
detail objection that you guys have

3274.98 --> 3280.2
mentioned so far every one of them

3277.559 --> 3283.26
I mean they've had 50 years to come up

3280.2 --> 3284.3999999999996
with excuses for everything and they

3283.26 --> 3287.88
have

3284.4 --> 3291.839
right they've done nothing useful if

3287.88 --> 3294.0
anything but they have found reasons why

3291.839 --> 3297.96
everything is the way it is

3294.0 --> 3299.64
supposedly so and I pretty much know all

3297.96 --> 3301.859
those

3299.64 --> 3304.22
because I believe in them when I was

3301.859 --> 3304.22
younger

3306.18 --> 3311.8799999999997
right so yeah the moon surface if you're

3308.819 --> 3314.7
supposedly Landing there is extremely

3311.88 --> 3317.579
overly bright and if you'd look at it

3314.7 --> 3319.68
standing on it with your open eyes

3317.579 --> 3323.1800000000003
you'll literally be blind in a few

3319.68 --> 3323.18

3390.72 --> 3395.3999999999996
gotta know that even as flat earther

3392.94 --> 3397.38
it's really pointless to start pointing

3395.4 --> 3398.76
it oh they could have never done that

3397.38 --> 3400.7400000000002
with this they could have never done

3398.76 --> 3403.8

3400.74 --> 3406.5589999999997
happen nothing about it happened

3403.8 --> 3409.94
why point out oh that couldn't happen

3406.559 --> 3413.52
the second you do it you're literally

3409.94 --> 3415.619
reaffirming the entire scenario

3413.52 --> 3417.059
you are even though you think you're

3415.619 --> 3419.76
denying it

3417.059 --> 3421.6800000000003
but you're literally presupposing just

3419.76 --> 3423.3
to point out how one little detail

3421.68 --> 3425.22
couldn't work

3423.3 --> 3427.46
well you just presupposed the whole

3425.22 --> 3427.4599999999996
thing

3431.16 --> 3435.48
so you got to be careful with that it's

3433.68 --> 3439.5589999999997
part of their trick

3435.48 --> 3441.9
they want you to start niniing want you

3439.559 --> 3444.6600000000003
to point at that one little object

3441.9 --> 3447.0
within their trickery and say oh that's

3444.66 --> 3449.64
wrong it couldn't be and then make like

3447.0 --> 3451.5
your make it your life's work so that

3449.64 --> 3454.02
your life's work is based on

3451.5 --> 3455.339
presupposing that any of it could ever

3454.02 --> 3459.24
happen

3455.339 --> 3462.359
that there is a place like as the Moon

3459.24 --> 3465.1189999999997

3462.359 --> 3466.0789999999997

3465.119 --> 3471.26
want

that's exactly what they want about it

3476.64 --> 3481.98
want you to look at their stuff and then

3479.22 --> 3484.0789999999997
start pointing fingers at things in

4287.48 --> 4293.239
going up that means inflation no it

[ __ ] and just say like ah we can't do it

4527.6 --> 4534.08
and they still get to keep the money

4530.78 --> 4539.199
how many times in history so far has

4534.08 --> 4539.199
NASA paid back money

4539.32 --> 4544.34
how many times does that happen

4543.08 --> 4548.48
look it up

4544.34 --> 4551.56
oh oh there's nothing to look up oh yeah

4548.48 --> 4554.36
yeah because they're not accountable

4551.56 --> 4557.120000000001
they're not actually accountable you see

4554.36 --> 4558.98
they can just do whatever the [ __ ] they

4557.12 --> 4562.099999999999
want

4558.98 --> 4564.919999999999
they're not accountable

4562.1 --> 4568.1
if you give NASA your money they can do

4564.92 --> 4570.7390000000005
whatever the [ __ ] they want with it and

4568.1 --> 4572.3
there's nothing you can do about it you

4570.739 --> 4574.82
can give you something

4572.3 --> 4579.219
it can not give you something and

4574.82 --> 4579.219
there's nothing you can do about it

4582.34 --> 4587.7390000000005
don't don't step away from the question

4588.38 --> 4591.1
yeah

4591.32 --> 4596.179
yeah they're spending public money so

4593.9 --> 4599.239
where exactly is the legal

4596.179 --> 4603.6990000000005
accountability yeah

4599.239 --> 4606.139999999999
show me an example show me an example of

4603.699 --> 4607.94
misspending from NASA

4606.14 --> 4611.179
that has had

4607.94 --> 4614.419999999999
an actual effect other than politicians

4611.179 --> 4617.9
being all very concerned about it

4614.42 --> 4619.46
right it may be even like oh yeah NASA

4617.9 --> 4621.86
you gotta fire that one guy because

4619.46 --> 4624.08
we're gonna just blame all of it on them

4621.86 --> 4627.679
or something right because they

4624.08 --> 4629.92
mishandle it or whatever yeah yeah so

4627.679 --> 4633.1990000000005
where's the accountability for real

4629.92 --> 4636.1990000000005
where's the legal

4633.199 --> 4636.199
accountability

4643.88 --> 4648.9800000000005
yeah

4646.64 --> 4653.3
with money to the government they give

4648.98 --> 4655.339999999999
money to no no hurry and alcohol no

4653.3 --> 4658.58
that's not how it works

4655.34 --> 4662.6
nobody gives money to the government

4658.58 --> 4664.699
they just printed and then they give it

4662.6 --> 4666.8
to NASA and there's nothing you can

4664.699 --> 4669.5599999999995
[ __ ] do about it

4666.8 --> 4671.6
and NASA is not accountable for the

4669.56 --> 4674.56
money that the government prints and

4671.6 --> 4674.56
hands them over

4675.199 --> 4681.739
oh you're still gonna have to pay the

4677.0 --> 4684.44
taxes for sure but you see that's your

4681.739 --> 4689.718999999999
[ __ ] problem

4684.44 --> 4691.239
not nasas you get it because they're not

4689.719 --> 4695.2390000000005
accountable

4691.239 --> 4697.099999999999
you're accountable for the money wasted

4695.239 --> 4699.799999999999
on NASA now what are you going to do

4697.1 --> 4701.719
about it you're going to sue NASA you're

4699.8 --> 4704.06
going to want your money back yeah how

4701.719 --> 4706.82
many times does that actually work

4704.06 --> 4709.820000000001
yeah no they're not accountable you see

4706.82 --> 4712.159
they can do whatever the [ __ ] they want

4709.82 --> 4715.219
as long as your government just keeps

4712.159 --> 4719.5599999999995
printing money and throwing it at them

4715.219 --> 4719.56
and there's nothing you can do about it

4721.46 --> 4726.38
not my problem I'm British okay fine you

4724.82 --> 4728.5599999999995
know what I mean

4726.38 --> 4728.56
foreign

4730.34 --> 4736.58
yeah they're not accountable

4733.28 --> 4739.159
that's a myth that's an urban myth yeah

4736.58 --> 4741.5
NASA is accountable for the spending no

4739.159 --> 4743.9
they're [ __ ] not show me one time

4741.5 --> 4745.76
where they've actually gotten into real

4743.9 --> 4748.46
trouble

4745.76 --> 4752.96
because of misallocations of finances

4748.46 --> 4756.02
which happens all the [ __ ] time

4752.96 --> 4757.76
yeah where where have they held been all

4756.02 --> 4760.580000000001
accountable

4757.76 --> 4763.659000000001
show me show me this example

4760.58 --> 4763.659
show me the article

4765.62 --> 4770.0199999999995
ah

4767.06 --> 4770.02
there isn't it

4773.87 --> 4777.12
[Music]

4777.219 --> 4784.4800000000005
it was public opinion

4781.64 --> 4784.4800000000005
sure it was

4787.04 --> 4789.4
what the hell does that have to do with

4788.54 --> 4790.58
accountability

4789.4 --> 4793.159
[Music]

4790.58 --> 4796.54
seriously what the hell does that have

4796.76 --> 4799.3
nothing

4801.0 --> 4804.1
[Music]

4805.4 --> 4812.239
yeah accountability is when things are

4808.64 --> 4815.54
already done when the money's been given

4812.239 --> 4817.759999999999
the stuff is supposedly happened that's

4815.54 --> 4820.46
when you become accountable for your

4817.76 --> 4822.02
actions or your inactions that's what

4820.46 --> 4825.38
I'm talking about I'm not talking about

4822.02 --> 4828.8
oh yes public or you have some weight

4825.38 --> 4831.32
you can stop or green light the moon

4828.8 --> 4834.08
landing yeah that's just called a public

4831.32 --> 4837.199
stunt it has absolutely [ __ ] all to do

4834.08 --> 4840.64
with accountability

4837.199 --> 4840.639999999999
yeah nothing

4849.24 --> 4854.728999999999
[Music]

4857.25 --> 4863.12
[Music]

4861.02 --> 4864.860000000001
they're not accountable

4863.12 --> 4867.5
you can think of them as being

4864.86 --> 4869.78
accountable but they're not they can do

4867.5 --> 4872.42
whatever the [ __ ] they want as soon as

4869.78 --> 4876.219
you hand over your money

4872.42 --> 4876.219
and there's nothing you can do about it

4876.38 --> 4881.900000000001
right unless

4878.44 --> 4884.96
you make a contract with them where they

4881.9 --> 4887.659
have to sign like yes we're going into a

4884.96 --> 4890.3
business agreement to do this and then

4887.659 --> 4892.339999999999
they become legally accountable for that

4890.3 --> 4894.92
contract that they signed

4892.34 --> 4899.2390000000005
yeah don't think that happens with

4894.92 --> 4901.52
actual space missions now does it

4899.239 --> 4904.28
it's just a public stunt it's like oh

4901.52 --> 4905.659000000001
you're a project here money try and make

4904.28 --> 4908.239
that work

4905.659 --> 4911.62
yeah they're not accountable if they

4908.239 --> 4911.62
fail nothing happens

4926.239 --> 4932.12
yeah just so for for the record you know

4929.12 --> 4934.84
they're not accountable

4932.12 --> 4934.84
they aren't

4934.94 --> 4939.62
they fail

4936.58 --> 4942.22
waste money

4939.62 --> 4954.44
nothing happens

4942.22 --> 4956.360000000001
[Music]

4954.44 --> 4959.0
I mean the worst that could happen to

4956.36 --> 4962.299999999999
them is that people lose confidence and

4959.0 --> 4963.65
just stop spending their money on them

4962.3 --> 4965.0
but

4963.65 --> 4967.759999999999
[Music]

4965.0 --> 4971.06
they don't even need the Public's money

4967.76 --> 4973.1
because they just make a little call to

4971.06 --> 4976.64
the fair War reserve and then they just

4973.1 --> 4978.9800000000005
print out a few billion for them so they

4976.64 --> 4980.179
don't actually need the Public's money

4978.98 --> 4982.94
even

4980.179 --> 4986.1990000000005
they just take it

4982.94 --> 4986.199
from the central back

4986.42 --> 4989.38
through the government

4991.46 --> 4998.36
so yeah they're not accountable NASA is

4995.0 --> 5001.02
not accountable we get it NASA is not

4998.36 --> 5001.0199999999995
accountable

5001.659 --> 5005.219
I got a title for today's show

5009.82 --> 5014.32
it's never talking about legal

5011.8 --> 5016.06
accountability oh yeah yeah you were

5014.32 --> 5018.82
that that's what you're talking about

5016.06 --> 5021.34
when you're talking about accountability

5018.82 --> 5024.099999999999
yeah what what other type of

5021.34 --> 5026.82
accountability were you talking about if

5024.1 --> 5026.820000000001
not legal

5026.92 --> 5029.46
hmm

5030.64 --> 5034.84
don't make me laugh you can't be

5032.92 --> 5036.82
seriously thinking that's that's like

5034.84 --> 5038.38
gonna hold up

5036.82 --> 5054.759999999999

5064.92 --> 5069.04
didn't say that didn't say this didn't

5067.12 --> 5071.26
say that yeah yeah you just said

5069.04 --> 5073.0
something obscure that apparently

5071.26 --> 5075.6990000000005
doesn't mean anything

5073.0 --> 5078.94
because any logical conclusion drawn

5075.699 --> 5082.299999999999
from the inference of using that word

5078.94 --> 5084.82
is now being denied by you so you just

5082.3 --> 5087.34
didn't mean anything then okay Orinoco

5084.82 --> 5091.0599999999995
Womble fine you didn't mean anything

5087.34 --> 5093.28
yeah I get it in the meantime NASA is

5091.06 --> 5096.280000000001
not accountable

foreign

5097.99 --> 5104.999
[Music]

5123.96 --> 5127.42
stop faking moon mission for many

5126.28 --> 5131.44
decades

5127.42 --> 5132.84
because the technology development would

5131.44 --> 5136.299999999999
make it

5132.84 --> 5138.52
infeasible to continue those types of

5136.3 --> 5141.34
operations

5138.52 --> 5144.88
they would not work anymore and they

5141.34 --> 5147.9400000000005
would probably ruin the original attempt

5144.88 --> 5150.219
yeah they would have redone moon landing

5147.94 --> 5153.159
and again and again while technology

5150.219 --> 5154.42
keeps upgrading people would have caught

5153.159 --> 5158.138999999999
on

5154.42 --> 5159.04
quicker like publicly that it is really

5158.139 --> 5161.1990000000005
fake

5159.04 --> 5163.84
the original Power of the original

5161.199 --> 5165.5199999999995
spelled that first moon landing would

5163.84 --> 5167.860000000001
have fizzled

5165.52 --> 5170.620000000001
because of re-exposure

5167.86 --> 5172.48
of new things with new technology so it

5170.62 --> 5174.94
would have never worked they couldn't do

5172.48 --> 5177.339999999999
it it was like this unique window of

5174.94 --> 5180.82
opportunity

5177.34 --> 5183.6990000000005
thanks to the curve of technological

5180.82 --> 5186.4
development which was right Midway it

5183.699 --> 5188.678999999999
was right there before the heavy Spike

5186.4 --> 5191.739
which we are in right now

5188.679 --> 5194.02
yeah and they knew it's only right there

5191.739 --> 5196.36
only in that part of the graph is this

5194.02 --> 5198.52
gonna work it's only gonna work for the

5196.36 --> 5200.98
boomer generation and after that they

5198.52 --> 5202.96
can't do it anymore and then they just

5200.98 --> 5205.178999999999
have to wait a bit until the cgis

5202.96 --> 5206.56
properly developed and then they can

5205.179 --> 5208.719
continue

5206.56 --> 5211.179
pure CGI

5208.719 --> 5212.9800000000005
because that thing will keep working to

5211.179 --> 5214.719
trick people that's why it still works

5212.98 --> 5216.699
in movies

5214.719 --> 5219.88
because it works it works because it

5216.699 --> 5222.96
works but actual physical actions like

5219.88 --> 5225.76
that it will not work the technology

5222.96 --> 5229.12
will have caught on people will be able

5225.76 --> 5229.54

5231.28 --> 5234.759999999999

what are you talking about yeah well

5571.9 --> 5577.96
care about are people

5574.96 --> 5581.08
that have a brain

5577.96 --> 5585.52

5581.08 --> 5589.6
actually willing to use all of that

5585.52 --> 5592.4800000000005

5600.639 --> 5604.84
that much that I'm willing to sacrifice

5602.86 --> 5607.719
the quality

5604.84 --> 5609.639
of the interactions with my chat because

5607.719 --> 5613.08

actually let in numpties

5613.54 --> 5618.94
and blabbermouths that that don't pay

5616.239 --> 5621.28

don't tell me to calm the [ __ ] down it's

5741.639 --> 5746.26
gonna make me more agitated unless

5744.219 --> 5748.78
you're just a troll wanting to do that

5746.26 --> 5753.6
in which case I will completely wipe you

5845.38 --> 5848.9800000000005
conversation in my chat that has

5847.36 --> 5850.48
absolutely nothing to do with what I'm

5848.98 --> 5852.28
talking about but

5850.48 --> 5854.459999999999
mine whenever

5852.28 --> 5857.639999999999
concerns NASA apparently

5854.46 --> 5857.64
[Music]

5868.84 --> 5872.5
anyway

5870.0 --> 5876.54
I think I'm gonna move towards rounding

5872.5 --> 5876.54
out the show hope you all enjoyed it

5877.0 --> 5883.84
except for Christian there

5880.6 --> 5886.42
who stepped into the wrong Saloon

5883.84 --> 5889.1990000000005
or he stepped into the right Saloon with

5886.42 --> 5889.1990000000005
the wrong attitude

5894.34 --> 5898.4800000000005
did enjoy it okay good to hear glad glad

5896.86 --> 5899.5
of that I mean it's been interesting

5898.48 --> 5903.54
it's

5899.5 --> 5903.54
we had yeah discussed NASA

5904.0 --> 5908.139
and their accountability which they do

5906.159 --> 5910.719
not have even though people still seems

5908.139 --> 5913.42
to think that they do

5910.719 --> 5916.96
no actual accountability has ever been

5913.42 --> 5920.56
followed through upon though

5916.96 --> 5922.84
unless you could give me an example huh

5920.56 --> 5925.120000000001
still hadn't gotten any

5922.84 --> 5927.28
I mean I mentioned it still have not

5925.12 --> 5930.46
gotten one example

5927.28 --> 5932.199
of the supposed NASA being accountable

5930.46 --> 5935.699
officially

5932.199 --> 5935.699
for something that they did wrong

5936.04 --> 5940.44
picking up firewood okay that's good

5944.02 --> 5949.360000000001
you're talking about the show title of

5945.94 --> 5951.94
the day okay excellent Eric carry on

5949.36 --> 5953.86
this is just I'm not completely

5951.94 --> 5956.58
following it but hey it's a good

5953.86 --> 5956.58
discussion to have

5958.659 --> 5964.42
so yeah carry on anyway

5961.42 --> 5964.42
uh

5973.3 --> 5979.659000000001
yearly performance and accountability

5975.76 --> 5983.26
report that's hilarious

5979.659 --> 5985.48
right so does anybody actually do

5983.26 --> 5987.6990000000005
anything with that report

5985.48 --> 5989.0
or should just put in a drawer and then

5987.699 --> 5994.8589999999995
nobody cares

5989.0 --> 5994.859
[Music]

6000.179 --> 6005.28
an accountability report well yeah

6003.179 --> 6006.42
accountability report is really cute to

6005.28 --> 6008.28
make that

6006.42 --> 6011.88
but it doesn't really mean anything

6008.28 --> 6014.5199999999995
unless somebody actually well drives the

6011.88 --> 6016.1990000000005
whole them accountable for something you

6014.52 --> 6018.780000000001
know

6016.199 --> 6021.599999999999
and that was my point but hilarious

6018.78 --> 6023.099999999999
thank you for that finding it's funny

6021.6 --> 6026.289000000001
an accountability

6023.1 --> 6026.289000000001
[Music]

6027.659 --> 6032.638999999999
you're right exactly accountable to who

6029.94 --> 6034.379999999999
yeah nobody it's just like oh we're

6032.639 --> 6036.78
we're so accountable

6034.38 --> 6038.43
we're performing we're so accountable

6036.78 --> 6042.5199999999995
for everything oh yes

6038.43 --> 6042.52
[Music]

6056.34 --> 6062.6990000000005
right I mean maybe

6060.54 --> 6065.219
maybe once

6062.699 --> 6068.159
somebody did actually read the

6065.219 --> 6071.82
accountability report

6068.159 --> 6075.599999999999
and then they probably got assassinated

6071.82 --> 6077.88
and of course I'm talking about Kennedy

6075.6 --> 6080.52
he I because that guy really seemed like

6077.88 --> 6081.719
an actual space Enthusiast I mean I

6080.52 --> 6084.179
would

6081.719 --> 6086.219
I'm assuming that he is not in the know

6084.179 --> 6088.57
that it's that it was fake I think that

6086.219 --> 6090.06
Kennedy really thought it was real

6088.57 --> 6092.58
[Music]

6090.06 --> 6095.580000000001
and he might have actually read the

6092.58 --> 6099.08
accountability report from then and then

6095.58 --> 6101.76
figured out this is all wrong

6099.08 --> 6104.48
and that might have led to him getting

6101.76 --> 6104.4800000000005
assassinated

6104.639 --> 6109.139
so yeah

6107.28 --> 6111.719
maybe that's why nobody reads the

6109.139 --> 6113.58
accountability report anymore because if

6111.719 --> 6117.0
somebody actually tries to hold them

6113.58 --> 6119.159
accountable they die and this is just

6117.0 --> 6121.76
weird speculation though but kind of

6119.159 --> 6125.58
funny to think of it like that

6121.76 --> 6128.04
[Music]

6125.58 --> 6129.54
right against the secret society is not

6128.04 --> 6132.179
yeah so it kind of does make sense

6129.54 --> 6134.699
wouldn't it that JFK would have actually

6132.179 --> 6137.28
read the accountability report and then

6134.699 --> 6138.839999999999
started to like oh well I don't like

6137.28 --> 6141.119
this one in that one you should do this

6138.84 --> 6142.7390000000005
different and then they're like

6141.119 --> 6145.08
okay

6142.739 --> 6149.0599999999995
yeah

6145.08 --> 6149.0599999999995
time to send in Prescott Bush

6149.58 --> 6155.28
or no wait uh

6151.5 --> 6155.28
that's his friend uh

6155.4 --> 6160.739
George George Bush Senior

6158.52 --> 6163.280000000001
right pretty sure he was involved in the

6160.739 --> 6163.28
assassination

6164.28 --> 6167.78
but yeah you know what I mean

6169.679 --> 6176.58
so it actually my my little silly notion

6174.0 --> 6180.32
conspiracy notion actually kind of makes

6176.58 --> 6180.32
sense that makes it even weirder

6186.119 --> 6190.799999999999
did they do anything with that well I

6188.46 --> 6192.719
don't even know what's in there

6190.8 --> 6194.6990000000005
I don't know what in what is in this

6192.719 --> 6196.8
suppose the accountability report but

6194.699 --> 6198.96
maybe Kennedy would

6196.8 --> 6202.7390000000005
I mean a believer

6198.96 --> 6205.92
in it would actually be caught trying to

6202.739 --> 6207.718999999999
take it serious right and then maybe do

6205.92 --> 6210.42
something about it

6207.719 --> 6212.4
I mean I doubt that anybody in like the

6210.42 --> 6214.619
US government now is actually going to

6212.4 --> 6218.699
read any of it because they all know

6214.619 --> 6221.699
it's completely fake I'm very certain

6218.699 --> 6224.46
that everybody in the US government

6221.699 --> 6226.5599999999995
most people that are actually like have

6224.46 --> 6229.26
control because they all know it is

6226.56 --> 6232.860000000001
totally fake they know it

6229.26 --> 6237.6
it's not a question anymore they know

6232.86 --> 6240.799999999999
doesn't does it mean that they care no

6237.6 --> 6240.8
but they know

6241.44 --> 6245.299999999999
they act like they know

6248.82 --> 6252.48
yeah

6250.02 --> 6254.88
yeah of course I remember that bjcina I

6252.48 --> 6257.82
mean JFK had like a whole bunch of

6254.88 --> 6259.8
pretty awesome speech well at the time

6257.82 --> 6261.48
sounding pretty awesome speech it it

6259.8 --> 6262.7390000000005
really seemed like he was really making

6261.48 --> 6266.218999999999
the effort

6262.739 --> 6269.959999999999
from his personal idealism and beliefs

6266.219 --> 6269.96
and that made it very interesting

6270.179 --> 6275.6990000000005
I mean you could say all kinds of things

6271.8 --> 6278.360000000001
about JFK but he was kind of an

6275.699 --> 6278.36
interesting president

6279.239 --> 6288.32
and also a flaming homosexual but yeah

6283.679 --> 6288.32
that's a that's a another matter

6290.88 --> 6295.8
the point is that he may have actually

6292.98 --> 6297.54
believed in the space stuff

6295.8 --> 6299.84
and that might have gotten him into

6297.54 --> 6299.84
trouble

6300.06 --> 6304.7390000000005
because space stuff is basically a cult

6302.46 --> 6306.42
it's directly tied into secret societies

6304.739 --> 6310.459999999999
he wanted to do something about secret

6306.42 --> 6312.719
society so there it all comes together

6310.46 --> 6317.46
[Music]

6312.719 --> 6319.679
you release UFO Secrets oh sure

6317.46 --> 6321.659
he was well I don't really think that

6319.679 --> 6325.38
matters

6321.659 --> 6328.759999999999
but then like no he he he wouldn't have

6325.38 --> 6328.76
actually been able to do that

6338.82 --> 6342.299999999999
he might have been able to talk about it

6340.739 --> 6345.659
but there's no way he would have ever

6342.3 --> 6348.96
been gotten like the actual blueprints

6345.659 --> 6351.0599999999995
or whatever in his hands

6348.96 --> 6352.679
in order to present it unlike live

6351.06 --> 6354.84
television there's just no way that it

6352.679 --> 6357.54
would have ever been have gone through

6354.84 --> 6358.81
even if he hadn't been assassinated

6357.54 --> 6363.689
so anyway

6358.81 --> 6363.689
[Music]

6363.86 --> 6369.239
by the way if he even is assassinated I

6367.02 --> 6372.3
mean it the assassination could also be

6369.239 --> 6375.959999999999
very fake and that he's still alive I

6372.3 --> 6377.28
mean literally JFK might right now still

6375.96 --> 6379.26
be alive

6377.28 --> 6381.719
and just living

6379.26 --> 6383.400000000001
isolated in like one of the Kennedy

6381.719 --> 6386.82
mentions

6383.4 --> 6389.099999999999
only to be visited by direct family

6386.82 --> 6390.719
I really think that JFK is actually

6389.1 --> 6394.38
alive still

6390.719 --> 6396.36
but yeah he's he was taken out of the

6394.38 --> 6398.52
picture of course

6396.36 --> 6400.679
whether he was actually assassinated or

6398.52 --> 6403.56
fake assassinated

6400.679 --> 6406.139
and yeah probably because of the secret

6403.56 --> 6409.320000000001
societies which by the way he would have

6406.139 --> 6412.159000000001
also had to have been a part of in a

6409.32 --> 6412.159
minor way at least

6414.179 --> 6419.3
at what age 104 yeah could be

6426.06 --> 6432.659000000001
maybe still alive 104 seems very old or

6430.44 --> 6435.799999999999
maybe like died in the 90s or something

6432.659 --> 6435.799999999999
I don't know

6437.58 --> 6441.96
I'm pretty sure well yeah it's likely

6439.679 --> 6443.76
that he is dead now

6441.96 --> 6446.04
I'm just saying I don't think he was

6443.76 --> 6448.38
actually assassinated I mean even like

6446.04 --> 6451.94
the supposed proof like that thing is a

6448.38 --> 6451.9400000000005
doll that's not a real person

6453.48 --> 6458.28
so

6455.88 --> 6459.4800000000005
I just yeah that's what I believe I'm

6458.28 --> 6461.639
not like gonna be all super

6459.48 --> 6464.28
conspiratorial about it I don't really

6461.639 --> 6466.82
even care that much

6464.28 --> 6469.679
but I I really do have a strong

6466.82 --> 6472.38
intuitive you could say suspicion that

6469.679 --> 6473.88
he wasn't actually assassinated that he

6472.38 --> 6474.78
was taken out of the picture and that

6473.88 --> 6479.42
they had

6474.78 --> 6479.42
they made this shock maneuver

6479.46 --> 6484.619
to kind of show off their power

6482.1 --> 6486.3
right he was against a secret society as

6484.619 --> 6488.88
well secret societies then basically

6486.3 --> 6491.28
killed his ass through the CIA

6488.88 --> 6493.1990000000005
in in a kind of overt way and it

6491.28 --> 6496.5599999999995
probably wasn't even him but they still

6493.199 --> 6500.0
made it like through it at everybody so

6496.56 --> 6500.0
it was like a public display

6500.1 --> 6505.109
like Hitler

6501.92 --> 6505.109
[Music]

6507.9 --> 6512.638999999999
ah

6509.94 --> 6515.4
no with Hitler it's different

6512.639 --> 6519.7390000000005
and Hitler who hitter actually made a

6515.4 --> 6519.739
deal with the Devil the Vatican that is

6520.199 --> 6524.82
yeah he didn't Rebel

6522.719 --> 6527.4
and then got taken down

6524.82 --> 6530.719
he kind of rebbled and then got

6527.4 --> 6530.719
approached and made a deal

6535.639 --> 6540.54
I mean I don't think Hitler was like

6538.26 --> 6541.92
assassinated and then replaced with like

6540.54 --> 6545.58
the lesbian

6541.92 --> 6547.92
guy uh yeah lesbian girl

6545.58 --> 6550.08
you know that that did all the the

6547.92 --> 6552.179
screaming speeches I don't think that he

6550.08 --> 6554.5199999999995
was actually assassinated I think that

6552.179 --> 6556.9800000000005
he literally was made a deal and then he

6554.52 --> 6559.02
went to Argentina anyway I'm rounding

6556.98 --> 6561.239
