138.239 --> 143.48000000000002
and it's just raining continually which

140.28 --> 145.92
is quite a pain in the ass

143.48 --> 148.23899999999998
because I have to go through that to get

145.92 --> 152.51899999999998
groceries after

148.239 --> 152.519
this cuz otherwise I don't have

lunch all right but I'll find

158.2 --> 162.64

161.0 --> 165.48
my umbrella with me

162.64 --> 170.159
and I'll

165.48 --> 170.159
manage but yeah it's cold and it's

174.879 --> 180.599
wet hello o first in chat good to see

178.76 --> 185.599
you

180.599 --> 185.599
it is Friday the 20th of October

189.879 --> 196.44
2023 I'm back on my old

192.92 --> 196.44
Channel my main

197.4 --> 203.92000000000002
Channel I'm still a bit

199.799 --> 206.44
late but yeah it's kind of weird because

203.92 --> 208.67999999999998
first off Nathan is not having a live

206.44 --> 211.68
show

208.68 --> 211.68
again

211.76 --> 216.0
because like yeah he had Parts breaking

214.36 --> 218.84
down

216.0 --> 220.519
and he's still in the middle of like

218.84 --> 223.28
getting that worked out it'll probably

220.519 --> 226.519
be back Monday I

223.28 --> 229.0
suspect cuz he's already got money for

226.519 --> 233.20000000000002
the parts and all that

229.0 --> 233.2
so that was very quick by the

236.84 --> 243.519
way but yeah he's not having a show so

240.12 --> 248.599
yeah I was planning to go a little later

243.519 --> 252.0
and then have original D row on but he

248.599 --> 253.56
yeah canceled on me which is like a huge

252.0 --> 256.4
bummer because I was really looking

253.56 --> 256.4
forward to having him

256.759 --> 262.47900000000004
on oh well so it's just going to be me

265.759 --> 271.52000000000004

278.88 --> 283.68
tea mint and I do have an Illuminati

283.759 --> 287.6
C because I'm really

288.44 --> 296.68
hungry right so I'm going to eat that

292.16 --> 296.68
later or as soon as

296.759 --> 301.56
it's the perfect temperature

302.72 --> 305.84000000000003
and

304.16 --> 310.52000000000004
uh

305.84 --> 310.52
yeah we'll see what we can talk about

326.4 --> 332.0
today I did leave a message

330.4 --> 334.63899999999995
my old Channel saying I was going to

332.0 --> 334.639
stream here

365.319 --> 373.24
bite out of this and then hopefully some

368.84 --> 373.23999999999995
more people show up and things get a bit

388.4 --> 393.13
rolling

390.08 --> 393.13
[Music]

400.52 --> 403.68
[Music]

415.36 --> 421.40000000000003
yeah it's always a challenge to go out

417.919 --> 421.4
there in this weather on my bicycle

421.44 --> 424.919
with an

422.72 --> 426.879
umbrella I mean that is a serious

424.919 --> 429.24
challenge especially if the wind is

426.879 --> 432.12
blowing hard but it's not doing that

429.24 --> 434.56
right now if the wind is blowing hard on

432.12 --> 438.039
top of raining I'm just not going

434.56 --> 438.039
outside screw

438.96 --> 444.78
that but I'll have to today because

441.28 --> 446.96
otherwise I don't have any lunch or

444.78 --> 449.479
[Music]

446.96 --> 451.919
anything hey Bumble clad G fish it's

449.479 --> 451.919
good to see

478.319 --> 481.319
you

485.86 --> 488.889
[Music]

508.24 --> 511.24
s

516.77 --> 523.139
[Music]

527.78 --> 531.0
[Music]

533.519 --> 536.5600000000001
man I really needed

538.2 --> 541.2
that

565.25 --> 571.12
[Applause]

568.12 --> 571.12
ah

572.16 --> 575.56
yeah so I'm running on my last

575.72 --> 581.6800000000001
spaghetti and everything so I'm like I

578.6 --> 581.6800000000001
got to get some

582.079 --> 586.56
new food for the coming

588.279 --> 595.64
period at least some welfare money did

592.12 --> 601.04
come in so that's like

595.64 --> 602.959
yeah finally the drought is over again a

601.04 --> 606.4399999999999
bit and

602.959 --> 608.16
like good timing too because there are

606.44 --> 610.6
certain supplements running out again

608.16 --> 612.4399999999999
and all that so it's probably not going

610.6 --> 614.76
to last very

612.44 --> 619.0790000000001
long

614.76 --> 619.079
right hey Dr utar good to see

620.72 --> 623.8090000000001
[Music]

627.279 --> 632.92
you back on the troll old

629.92 --> 632.92
Channel

636.59 --> 643.3090000000001
[Music]

648.36 --> 656.6
what what do you mean Dr

652.88 --> 656.6
utar the troll

658.04 --> 661.04
Channel

677.56 --> 683.7199999999999
there are more

678.639 --> 686.839
trolls here than on our winning bear

683.72 --> 688.6800000000001
no you'd be surprised how many trolls

686.839 --> 691.8000000000001
I've banned on that channel I mean they

688.68 --> 691.8
all come over

692.36 --> 697.0
there right these trolls are not like

694.839 --> 699.5600000000001
happen stance

697.0 --> 702.76
trolls they're all people that like to

699.56 --> 705.7199999999999
hang around fed and myself and they

702.76 --> 707.6
follow you around I bet that if I go to

705.72 --> 709.639
an entirely different platform that

707.6 --> 712.839
they'll just follow me there they did

709.639 --> 714.839
with di the same people follow you

712.839 --> 717.6800000000001
around they're stalkers they're cyber

714.839 --> 717.6800000000001
stalkers all of

717.959 --> 724.3599999999999
them and I banned them all on arnian

720.68 --> 724.3599999999999
bear as well it's the same names

727.12 --> 731.399
so this channel is just a little

747.88 --> 750.88
bigger

777.839 --> 780.839
oh

803.48 --> 807.0790000000001
right so what do you guys want to talk

807.76 --> 810.76
about

813.92 --> 818.7199999999999
otherwise I'll just start diving around

816.839 --> 821.399
and see if there's anything particular

818.72 --> 821.399
that I can bring

825.68 --> 831.959
up other by the way than

829.04 --> 835.12
like why I got the strikes and

831.959 --> 837.88
everything well all the things I

835.12 --> 840.519
said right in the show that's said

837.88 --> 846.36
previous before this one so it's

840.519 --> 846.36
like 7048 or something wait let me

847.839 --> 854.639
check but it's like everything that I've

850.399 --> 857.16
said yeah no 7044 is the previous

854.639 --> 859.8
one everything I said

857.16 --> 862.8389999999999
before about the whole grocery store

859.8 --> 862.8389999999999
situation and all

863.44 --> 869.8000000000001
that it's all dead on target it's

867.24 --> 871.759
like I mean but it's it's like so easy

869.8 --> 876.0
to predict though it's like how can you

871.759 --> 876.0
not see all those things right

879.24 --> 883.48
there but there's a lot of like

881.32 --> 885.88
alternative news coming out about it

883.48 --> 885.88
lots of

885.92 --> 892.8
people that are coming out and and like

889.079 --> 892.8
testifying to this kind of

897.68 --> 900.68
thing

902.48 --> 908.1990000000001
so there's just there really in a way is

905.72 --> 910.6800000000001
kind of an Awakening happening it's

908.199 --> 912.88
almost kind of cliche to say that now

910.68 --> 916.079
but there's so

912.88 --> 918.56
many people and in media it's like

916.079 --> 920.279
they're they're all doing it they're all

918.56 --> 922.4799999999999
like moving in that direction and it's

920.279 --> 925.92
like if you don't you're

922.48 --> 925.9200000000001
just you're

927.6 --> 931.88
screwed cuz now you're part of the

929.8 --> 934.519
establishment and and

931.88 --> 937.199
like your soul is

934.519 --> 939.5600000000001
forfeit you'll get ravaged by demons if

937.199 --> 942.24
you side with them you just do because

939.56 --> 942.2399999999999
they are

943.68 --> 949.399
demonic tired like deep State Global

954.68 --> 963.0
government and including Zionism like

958.839 --> 964.72
the whole mish mash of this Neo feudal

963.0 --> 967.24
control

964.72 --> 969.12
conspiracy is getting seriously

967.24 --> 971.72
uncovered

969.12 --> 976.519
like yeah I was getting uncovered a

971.72 --> 979.0400000000001
decade ago and more but I mean now it's

976.519 --> 981.04
like it's like really it's like the last

979.04 --> 984.279
layers of the onion

981.04 --> 984.279
are are

985.279 --> 990.72
through it's getting completely exposed

988.04 --> 993.639
now on a on a scale that's never been H

990.72 --> 996.3190000000001
that's never happened before like if you

993.639 --> 998.8
compare now how many people know about

996.319 --> 1000.68
how this actually works compared to say

998.8 --> 1005.56
100 years

1000.68 --> 1009.8
ago I'd say it's become like 10,000

1005.56 --> 1014.2399999999999
times the awareness at

1009.8 --> 1017.04
least 10,000 times more the awareness

1014.24 --> 1019.88
it's so much more it's crazy about like

1017.04 --> 1022.639
how the entire thing has been building

1019.88 --> 1024.64
up it's like it's understood now and

1022.639 --> 1025.6
it's understood very widely and that is

1024.64 --> 1028.5590000000002
kind of

1025.6 --> 1031.12
unique it also for me personally feels a

1028.559 --> 1033.559
bit like yeah what the hell took you so

1031.12 --> 1036.039
long everything sto the [ __ ] it's like

1033.559 --> 1039.959
oh I'm Bas and I have been complaining

1036.039 --> 1044.24
for a while in a way in

1039.959 --> 1048.88
myself like Humanity just sucks I mean

1044.24 --> 1052.1200000000001
it just sucks because they're all too

1048.88 --> 1054.2
[ __ ] [ __ ] to do anything about

1052.12 --> 1059.2399999999998
anything as long as they're comfortable

1054.2 --> 1061.52
like evil literally has to destroy MIM

1059.24 --> 1064.799
and torture like

1061.52 --> 1066.8799999999999
everything until there's nothing left

1064.799 --> 1069.8799999999999
before people actually start to do

1066.88 --> 1070.96
anything about it because they're they

1069.88 --> 1075.44
are

1070.96 --> 1075.44
inherently collectively

1076.88 --> 1083.44
[ __ ] it's one of the things about

1079.28 --> 1083.44
Humanity that I am just so sick

1084.159 --> 1089.8400000000001
of that makes me sometimes flip over to

1087.679 --> 1095.24
the radical eugenesis

1089.84 --> 1099.4399999999998
side mentally cuz I'm just so sick of

1095.24 --> 1101.6
[ __ ] dumb stubborn people I'm so sick

1099.44 --> 1101.6000000000001
of

1104.32 --> 1109.72
them like that colle like like no I

1107.559 --> 1113.76
don't have to

1109.72 --> 1116.76
understand I can just continue doing

1113.76 --> 1119.28
things the way based on a societal model

1116.76 --> 1123.12
that hasn't existed for a

1119.28 --> 1123.12
decade like you

1129.44 --> 1137.3200000000002
guys like people like that conjure or

1134.08 --> 1142.8799999999999
summon you could say they they call it

1137.32 --> 1145.28
out they call out like total utter

1142.88 --> 1148.2
destruction people that live like that

1145.28 --> 1150.72
they call upon themselves total and

1148.2 --> 1150.72
utter

1151.32 --> 1157.84
destruction people that can't figure out

1155.4 --> 1159.76
that Society has radically changed and

1157.84 --> 1161.76
that they have

1159.76 --> 1164.96
to

1161.76 --> 1168.559
reset their social

1164.96 --> 1170.6000000000001
mechanisms their autopilot Collective

1168.559 --> 1173.3999999999999
responses like oh I'm in a group I'm

1170.6 --> 1177.1589999999999
going to do this you have to change it

1173.4 --> 1180.48
all because it's completely corrupted

1177.159 --> 1184.7600000000002
now like they've colonized all these

1180.48 --> 1184.76
Collective Spirits all of

1184.88 --> 1189.919
it everything that you knew all the

1187.48 --> 1191.96
actions that that were typical that

1189.919 --> 1195.2
everybody Associated like that's my

1191.96 --> 1198.28
group all of it it's all been

1195.2 --> 1199.4
colonized through social engineering

1198.28 --> 1204.2
it's all

1199.4 --> 1209.8400000000001
taken if you if you lean on it just a

1204.2 --> 1209.8400000000001
[ __ ] little you conjure absolute

1222.24 --> 1226.1200000000001
[Music]

1223.36 --> 1230.1589999999999
disaster right and it's becoming very

1226.12 --> 1230.1589999999999
apparent that that is the case

1239.76 --> 1249.679
cuz if people don't scramble and adapt

1243.36 --> 1251.84
to like an accelerated change that is an

1249.679 --> 1255.88
accelerated societal change that is

1251.84 --> 1258.9599999999998
taking place if we don't adapt to

1255.88 --> 1264.0
it and I mean adapt

1258.96 --> 1266.8400000000001
like [ __ ] all your old plans all of

1264.0 --> 1268.6
it you can throw it all in the bin it's

1266.84 --> 1271.48
all

1268.6 --> 1273.559
gone most things like I mean there's

1271.48 --> 1275.279
dreams there's longtime ideas but if

1273.559 --> 1278.799
you're going to base those ideas

1275.279 --> 1281.559
somewhat on a cohesive society as you've

1278.799 --> 1283.6399999999999
known it well good [ __ ] luck you can

1281.559 --> 1286.44
chase that dream until you're literally

1283.64 --> 1290.5200000000002
dead cuz it's not going to happen not in

1286.44 --> 1290.52
this world not in how things work right

1293.919 --> 1299.5590000000002
now you got to work this from

1297.2 --> 1302.88
scratch and the only thing you can

1299.559 --> 1302.8799999999999
really depend on is your

1303.12 --> 1309.4799999999998
own the people that you can like that

1307.32 --> 1313.32
you know and that you bond with and have

1309.48 --> 1316.52
a trust with directly to build it with

1313.32 --> 1319.08
like you can't count on society anymore

1316.52 --> 1321.8799999999999
you can't like oh like I'm going to

1319.08 --> 1323.799
shove this idea forwards it's great and

1321.88 --> 1325.8400000000001
then like everybody will take it and

1323.799 --> 1328.679
then it will improve Society yeah yeah

1325.84 --> 1328.6789999999999
yeah well not

1331.88 --> 1337.279
anymore cuz it's all been cut off it

1334.88 --> 1339.8400000000001
doesn't work like that anymore it's all

1337.279 --> 1342.72
getting cut off we are besieged the

1339.84 --> 1345.6399999999999
entire societal function is besieged it

1342.72 --> 1348.72
can't work anymore and in some places in

1345.64 --> 1350.3600000000001
the world like for example s Francisco

1348.72 --> 1352.64
it's so

1350.36 --> 1356.1999999999998
bad that it's

1352.64 --> 1356.2
like total

1356.48 --> 1362.0
hell and in other places it's not that

1359.36 --> 1364.84
bad yet because there's people that have

1362.0 --> 1367.44
realized how bad it is getting and

1364.84 --> 1369.76
basically bracing against that like

1367.44 --> 1371.76
doing everything they can to still

1369.76 --> 1373.1589999999999
maintain some sort of stability of the

1371.76 --> 1376.32
old

1373.159 --> 1379.0
system that's keeping like food

1376.32 --> 1381.96
availability and all that supermarkets

1379.0 --> 1381.96
and all

1382.159 --> 1387.5200000000002
that I'm surprised that things are as

1385.96 --> 1389.679
stable as they seem here in the

1387.52 --> 1391.52
Netherlands despite the price increase

1389.679 --> 1393.4
right I expected that this price

1391.52 --> 1397.4
increase would like literally make

1393.4 --> 1401.44
things start shutting down on a massive

1397.4 --> 1401.44
scale surprisingly it

1401.96 --> 1408.08
hasn't although maybe that's just in the

1405.24 --> 1411.559
areas where I go around I mean there's

1408.08 --> 1414.559
to be victims of because of

1411.559 --> 1414.559
it

1436.88 --> 1439.88
anyway

1456.08 --> 1461.279
A Min in the mountains wow okay that's

1466.799 --> 1469.799
serious

1470.6 --> 1475.12
right so you got a good Hideout well

1472.279 --> 1475.12
that's cool

1478.52 --> 1484.44
RoR but I mean if it really collapses

1482.399 --> 1487.1999999999998
it's not going to do you much good

1484.44 --> 1488.799
because there will be people hordes of

1487.2 --> 1490.48
people roaming around and they will be

1488.799 --> 1494.32
armed to the

1490.48 --> 1494.32
teeth and they will be

1494.799 --> 1501.8799999999999
Savage so unless you got like a bunker

1497.559 --> 1501.8799999999999
with the machine gun and unlimited

1502.72 --> 1508.73
ammo it's not going to last very

1505.58 --> 1508.73
[Music]

1526.679 --> 1529.679
long

1532.24 --> 1537.96
chances are you won't make it up there

1534.039 --> 1537.96
yeah that's also an issue

1540.24 --> 1546.2
typically or but the problem also is

1543.08 --> 1549.1999999999998
that somebody else could just find

1546.2 --> 1552.0
it and just take all your

1549.2 --> 1556.679
stuff I mean unless you actually manage

1552.0 --> 1559.679
to build like a door and a lock and all

1556.679 --> 1559.679
that

1561.679 --> 1565.64
or like have a like a hiding

1567.919 --> 1572.679
spot like a hole in the ground you can

1570.36 --> 1572.6789999999999
cover

1586.6 --> 1589.6
up

1590.44 --> 1595.24
most are learning to distrust to this

1592.679 --> 1595.24
yeah yeah it's

1599.36 --> 1606.12
something this not a very Advanced stage

1602.2 --> 1609.52
yet though but it's like the majority is

1606.12 --> 1612.2399999999998
finally getting a hint and it's about

1609.52 --> 1612.24
damn time

1616.6 --> 1621.589
too

1618.49 --> 1621.589
[Music]

1630.679 --> 1635.48
H five miles to reach in wow

1643.72 --> 1649.84
okay people don't know how to survive

1646.2 --> 1649.8400000000001
without toilet paper that's

1665.519 --> 1670.519
hilarious right so there's that

1667.519 --> 1670.519
happening and there

1672.399 --> 1679.1589999999999
is just the same situation

1676.08 --> 1681.519
everywhere right like our cabinet even

1679.159 --> 1681.519
though it's

1681.799 --> 1687.6
Fallen they're just like blocking the

1684.679 --> 1690.279
doors and letting everything

1687.6 --> 1692.36
happen and like working along with the

1690.279 --> 1695.12
collective and that's what they're all

1692.36 --> 1696.9189999999999
doing in their own way like all these

1695.12 --> 1700.1999999999998
cabinets everywhere in the United States

1696.919 --> 1703.64
in the Netherlands all over Europe

1700.2 --> 1707.64
England too they're all doing the same

1703.64 --> 1710.8400000000001
damn thing like the thing that literally

1707.64 --> 1713.159
nobody wants like this is not even like

1710.84 --> 1716.0
oh that's not a good policy or like I

1713.159 --> 1719.0800000000002
don't want to be egotistical or no it's

1716.0 --> 1722.24
just everything that they want to do is

1719.08 --> 1724.6789999999999
absolutely horrendous and there's only

1722.24 --> 1729.799
bad things that can come of

1724.679 --> 1729.799
it and they're all doing it exactly the

1730.679 --> 1736.3990000000001
same like they they're not even like

1733.559 --> 1739.76
dichotomizing anything like oh creating

1736.399 --> 1741.1589999999999
a polarity to like force a choice right

1739.76 --> 1743.64
no they're not even doing that it's just

1741.159 --> 1745.88
like no it's just terrible and this

1743.64 --> 1750.2
terrible thing and that terrible thing

1745.88 --> 1752.44
and this horrendous thing all will end

1750.2 --> 1754.519
everything that you know and

1752.44 --> 1757.679
love and that's what they try to roll

1754.519 --> 1757.679
out it's complete

1761.96 --> 1768.159
Insanity and technically there should be

1764.799 --> 1770.36
all kinds of groups now every where like

1768.159 --> 1773.64
ready to take it over

1770.36 --> 1777.24
because it's about to get switch time I

1773.64 --> 1779.72
think I think the time is coming coming

1777.24 --> 1783.519
soon I've heard some

1779.72 --> 1786.919
hints that I'm definitely not going to

1783.519 --> 1790.76
Source but my Visions

1786.919 --> 1794.0
too alluded to this I've been waiting

1790.76 --> 1796.799
for it for so long that like but I can

1794.0 --> 1799.24
feel it coming I can feel it even like

1796.799 --> 1801.519
it's an actual palpable feeling here in

1799.24 --> 1804.0
the third dimension

1801.519 --> 1808.64
now I said it was going to come this

1804.0 --> 1808.64
year it might actually be this

1811.12 --> 1816.2399999999998
year where simultaneously everywhere

1814.159 --> 1819.24
around the

1816.24 --> 1821.1200000000001
world there will be a rise up like

1819.24 --> 1824.08
simultaneous and they will all be

1821.12 --> 1824.08
overthrown all

1826.24 --> 1829.24
simultaneously

1829.799 --> 1834.48
and I cannot wait I mean it's going to

1832.2 --> 1836.76
be chaos after that for a

1834.48 --> 1838.72
bit and it's going to be like

1836.76 --> 1841.0
complicated trying to get a bearing as

1838.72 --> 1844.08
to like how things have become now

1841.0 --> 1847.32
because we don't know that yet how it

1844.08 --> 1849.84
will actually become after

1847.32 --> 1852.32
that like there's no guarantee that

1849.84 --> 1854.039
we'll all be friendly and allies once

1852.32 --> 1857.639
we've switched you

1854.039 --> 1859.84
see things may completely change like

1857.639 --> 1862.039
unrecognizable like suddenly the world's

1859.84 --> 1864.799
completely different and like nothing

1862.039 --> 1867.039
works the same anymore like as in

1864.799 --> 1868.519
geopolitically it can become very

1867.039 --> 1870.76
complicated when that sort of thing

1868.519 --> 1873.559
happens you don't exactly know yet it's

1870.76 --> 1877.08
not you can hope for some kind of

1873.559 --> 1878.24
uniformity but the chances are there

1877.08 --> 1880.8799999999999
won't

1878.24 --> 1882.96
be cuz the uniformity has always kind of

1880.88 --> 1886.159
been forced on us

1882.96 --> 1889.559
anyway so there is this need to retract

1886.159 --> 1893.159
more to our original positions like all

1889.559 --> 1893.1589999999999
these hijacked

1894.44 --> 1900.24
countries so there are chances that once

1897.08 --> 1902.8799999999999
that happens that it won't be uniform it

1900.24 --> 1906.3990000000001
won't be some new

1902.88 --> 1908.279
super state or something some super

1906.399 --> 1911.84
group

1908.279 --> 1914.2
necessarily but it has to like be

1911.84 --> 1916.4399999999998
synchronized to overthrow it all because

1914.2 --> 1918.519
if you just overthrow one group then all

1916.44 --> 1921.3200000000002
the others will like like help out and

1918.519 --> 1923.84
jump in to prevent that from

1921.32 --> 1927.399
happening if it happen simultaneously

1923.84 --> 1927.399
everywhere then they can't stop

1930.2 --> 1935.6390000000001
it yeah supply chain Interruption that's

1932.84 --> 1938.1999999999998
exactly what yeah but that's what would

1935.639 --> 1940.1999999999998
happen if one country would go into

1938.2 --> 1942.0
Revolution they'd literally cut

1940.2 --> 1944.24
everything off and you there everybody

1942.0 --> 1948.2
just

1944.24 --> 1950.639
dies or well unless got great Farmers I

1948.2 --> 1952.8400000000001
mean the Netherlands might survive such

1950.639 --> 1952.84
a

1953.12 --> 1957.399
thing

1954.76 --> 1960.6
barely but I mean survive it won't

1957.399 --> 1962.9189999999999
flourish under that but if all these

1960.6 --> 1966.1999999999998
revolutions around the world happen at

1962.919 --> 1968.1200000000001
the same time then there's nobody to cut

1966.2 --> 1971.72
anybody off and

1968.12 --> 1974.4399999999998
then as soon as trade can become

1971.72 --> 1976.039
possible again everybody will be eager

1974.44 --> 1978.159
to make these

1976.039 --> 1981.039
deals

1978.159 --> 1984.0390000000002
more likely there will not be a blockade

1981.039 --> 1986.24
because everybody else is out

1984.039 --> 1989.399
there against

1986.24 --> 1991.96
you or those States who who controls

1989.399 --> 1991.9599999999998
them right

1992.72 --> 1995.919
so a

1996.24 --> 2002.0
worldwide simultaneous

1999.12 --> 2005.399
Revolution might

2002.0 --> 2008.679
happen it might be very quick it might

2005.399 --> 2011.12
take a year before it gets to that point

2008.679 --> 2013.24
I don't know I really hope it's going to

2011.12 --> 2016.7199999999998
be quick because there seems to be just

2013.24 --> 2019.1200000000001
a lot of damage being done regularly now

2016.72 --> 2021.6000000000001
they're accelerating the damage

2019.12 --> 2023.7199999999998
rate of what they're doing they're

2021.6 --> 2025.9189999999999
making things worse I mean you think

2023.72 --> 2028.96
that nitrogen

2025.919 --> 2033.0
policy was terrible they already moved

2028.96 --> 2035.519
on to the next thing they're like oh you

2033.0 --> 2037.6
think one thing that's terrible they

2035.519 --> 2040.519
have like 20

2037.6 --> 2043.24
other horrendous things that will they

2040.519 --> 2045.559
put right on top of it and none of it

2043.24 --> 2048.48
will make any sense and it will just do

2045.559 --> 2051.48
it just like that just to say [ __ ] you

2048.48 --> 2053.919
die [ __ ] that's what they say that's

2051.48 --> 2056.8
what they think when they do it it's all

2053.919 --> 2060.52
just meant to destroy you and they got

2056.8 --> 2065.119
endless supplies of it endless supply

2060.52 --> 2071.2
of policy weapons to destroy

2065.119 --> 2073.3990000000003
you endlessly it will never become less

2071.2 --> 2074.399
it will only get worse the longer you

2073.399 --> 2078.52
leave him

2074.399 --> 2080.919
there there is no other option than to

2078.52 --> 2082.919
overthrow them but it it's got to be

2080.919 --> 2084.2
simultaneously everywhere everybody's

2082.919 --> 2086.72
got to be

2084.2 --> 2088.5989999999997
ready and then as soon as the first one

2086.72 --> 2090.48
happens everybody's going to make a move

2088.599 --> 2093.32
all all at once and everybody's got to

2090.48 --> 2098.879
know that everybody else is ready if you

2093.32 --> 2098.8790000000004
leave one out we could all be screwed

2102.8 --> 2106.599
and then well at least that country that

2105.359 --> 2110.5989999999997
doesn't

2106.599 --> 2112.599
Revolution would be very

2110.599 --> 2116.079
screwed and it could have a lot of

2112.599 --> 2118.2400000000002
backlash whatever man just just just

2116.079 --> 2120.599
meta

2118.24 --> 2124.4399999999996
strategy I barely know what I'm talking

2120.599 --> 2124.44
about but I I know

2125.8 --> 2129.96
like roughly what's going to

2137.28 --> 2141.23
happen I mean I've been like sort of

2139.68 --> 2142.5989999999997
like calling for this for

2141.23 --> 2147.119
[Music]

2142.599 --> 2147.119
years some of you might even remember

2148.079 --> 2152.92
that I think I've been calling for this

2150.44 --> 2152.92
since like

2153.48 --> 2158.8
2018 but now it's just very

2161.839 --> 2167.52
blatant cuz the the policies that are

2164.359 --> 2170.2
getting introduced are just so vicious

2167.52 --> 2172.7599999999998
now and I mean in my country it's so

2170.2 --> 2176.839
insane in my country they're doing it

2172.76 --> 2176.8390000000004
well they're not even officially a

2178.52 --> 2184.48
cabinet they're blocking new a new

2182.28 --> 2188.0400000000004
cabinet from forming

2184.48 --> 2191.16
basically allegedly

2188.04 --> 2193.2
and while they're still Auto ramming

2191.16 --> 2195.56
through all the the

2193.2 --> 2199.04
crap it's just like they don't they

2195.56 --> 2201.7599999999998
don't care whether they were officially

2199.04 --> 2203.839
taken out of

2201.76 --> 2207.96
power they're like

2203.839 --> 2210.92
squatting in in their positions like no

2207.96 --> 2212.56
we're just not going away it doesn't

2210.92 --> 2214.359
make any sense nobody's going to do

2212.56 --> 2218.96
anything about

2214.359 --> 2218.96
it everybody's just leaving it like like

2226.2 --> 2231.48
that so we we can assume that the

2229.079 --> 2233.5600000000004
military is in on it the police are in

2231.48 --> 2238.68
on

2233.56 --> 2238.68
it which means they have a huge

2244.96 --> 2249.8
problem and I mean the police and

2247.079 --> 2251.2400000000002
military cuz I mean they are accomplice

2249.8 --> 2252.76
they are accomplice for everything

2251.24 --> 2254.68
that's happening they're accomplices for

2252.76 --> 2258.2400000000002
the destruction of this country a lot of

2254.68 --> 2258.24
them are going to go to jail after

2260.8 --> 2269.04
this and most of them will literally

2263.68 --> 2269.04
never get a job in those fields

2275.599 --> 2278.599
again

2279.4 --> 2286.0
cuz you're Nazi criminals that's what

2281.839 --> 2286.0
you are you're like Nazi

2288.16 --> 2295.52
criminals you are helping to protect a

2291.76 --> 2298.28
Marxist system that is

2295.52 --> 2300.079
destroying the value

2298.28 --> 2304.0
capability and

2300.079 --> 2304.0
production of the

2304.079 --> 2312.1600000000003
citizens and of the country everything

2308.359 --> 2312.16
you're Marxist

2313.079 --> 2318.28
traitors and you will pay for that

2316.119 --> 2321.079
treachery

2318.28 --> 2323.7200000000003
dearly like whatever is going to hurt

2321.079 --> 2326.319
you it will it will be

2323.72 --> 2328.5989999999997
done yeah oh you do it for the money

2326.319 --> 2330.96
then all your money will be taken you do

2328.599 --> 2332.8
it to protect somebody well guess what

2330.96 --> 2334.7200000000003
all their protection will be taken away

2332.8 --> 2337.4
and it will be publicly

2334.72 --> 2339.9199999999996
humiliated whatever is it is that you

2337.4 --> 2341.2000000000003
think you're doing this for helping the

2339.92 --> 2344.16
[ __ ] deep

2341.2 --> 2347.64
State you will be punished in that

2344.16 --> 2351.1189999999997
specific [ __ ] way you hear you'll be

2347.64 --> 2352.5989999999997
punished in that specific way oh you oh

2351.119 --> 2354.7200000000003
I don't care about this and I don't care

2352.599 --> 2357.6800000000003
about we will find the thing that you

2354.72 --> 2359.2
care about and then punish you with

2357.68 --> 2362.24
that

2359.2 --> 2363.68
yeah that's how serious this is you are

2362.24 --> 2366.9599999999996
a

2363.68 --> 2371.52
traitor fundamental traitor to the

2366.96 --> 2371.52
country by allowing all this to

2371.92 --> 2379.56
continue by working along with them by

2375.72 --> 2383.56
not organizing an overthrow which is

2379.56 --> 2383.56
definitely required in this

2386.16 --> 2390.64
time yeah if people that are Dem

2388.839 --> 2392.839
missionary in the cabinet whatever

2390.64 --> 2394.92
they're just obstructing things they're

2392.839 --> 2398.319
obstructing legal procedures they're

2394.92 --> 2400.04
obstructing procedures

2398.319 --> 2402.4
well that's the time where you should

2400.04 --> 2404.8
basically say oh oh yeah you're there

2402.4 --> 2407.079
supposedly to help things progress well

2404.8 --> 2410.3590000000004
you're not helping things progress so

2407.079 --> 2412.88
we're going to drag you out now and put

2410.359 --> 2415.52
somebody else there to do the Dem

2412.88 --> 2418.76
missionary function that does not

2415.52 --> 2421.7599999999998
obstruct the new formation of the

2418.76 --> 2421.76
cabinet

2422.52 --> 2428.359
[Music]

2425.359 --> 2428.359
huh

2431.04 --> 2434.2
that would be an interesting

2434.56 --> 2439.52
start it's all getting very real now for

2442.64 --> 2447.2799999999997
me so there you go I talked about

2453.78 --> 2458.3190000000004
[Music]

2455.319 --> 2458.319
something

2479.04 --> 2483.7599999999998
all right anyway let me say hello to

2480.48 --> 2488.8
everybody that got in

2483.76 --> 2488.8
here seeking star water Richard

2498.64 --> 2505.92
G SL moon

2501.4 --> 2505.92
buggy to see you ter

2506.079 --> 2509.079
306

2513.74 --> 2518.24
[Music]

2515.24 --> 2518.24
huh

2525.9 --> 2531.969
[Music]

2534.96 --> 2539.559
right right also I might be able to

2537.52 --> 2542.92
predict something that's

2539.559 --> 2544.7200000000003
weird you see this whole situation with

2542.92 --> 2547.92
black rock and

2544.72 --> 2549.68
Vanguard how they like owning everything

2547.92 --> 2551.04
starting to like buy up everything

2549.68 --> 2553.9199999999996
through the

2551.04 --> 2555.0
crisis well that's not going to work for

2553.92 --> 2557.839
very

2555.0 --> 2560.119
long and then after that something

2557.839 --> 2562.359
really crazy is about to happen which

2560.119 --> 2566.0
I've also seen in my Visions by the way

2562.359 --> 2566.0
it's all very interesting very

2567.76 --> 2572.3590000000004
surreal because what's going to happen

2570.52 --> 2575.2
is

2572.359 --> 2576.68
that well it's very similar to like

2575.2 --> 2579.319
things that happen around around World

2576.68 --> 2583.44
War III and all

2579.319 --> 2587.119
that like if some Mega Corporation or

2583.44 --> 2590.44
Titan like owns a lot well they're going

2587.119 --> 2594.1600000000003
to be broken up not just broken up

2590.44 --> 2597.28
they're probably going to like be put on

2594.16 --> 2601.5589999999997
trial like Black Rock fangu the people

2597.28 --> 2605.8390000000004
that are part of that that are doing all

2601.559 --> 2609.3190000000004
that they're going to be taken and like

2605.839 --> 2612.5589999999997
all all their assets sees

2609.319 --> 2614.68
everything which means like almost the

2612.559 --> 2616.0
majority of things in the world at this

2614.68 --> 2619.1189999999997
point

2616.0 --> 2621.96
right but they have to and after that

2619.119 --> 2624.119
point it will be nationalized like

2621.96 --> 2626.319
everything will be given to the state it

2624.119 --> 2626.319
is

2626.64 --> 2635.24
in and then the state can dispense it or

2631.839 --> 2638.44
sell it or however they seem fit and

2635.24 --> 2640.7999999999997
then everything will be of the people

2638.44 --> 2644.04
locally and the

2640.8 --> 2645.2400000000002
government as it was before and as it

2644.04 --> 2648.8
should

2645.24 --> 2651.24
be but that will also

2648.8 --> 2653.88
happen that may might take a little

2651.24 --> 2656.7599999999998
longer it might even like take a very

2653.88 --> 2659.92
long time but the point is is that these

2656.76 --> 2663.44
psychotic grabler are just like sucking

2659.92 --> 2663.44
up all the money of the world

2664.28 --> 2668.96
but the only thing that can do it is

2666.8 --> 2671.52
just buy more and try to ruin more

2668.96 --> 2674.2
things but it doesn't really

2671.52 --> 2677.72
work and eventually it they will just

2674.2 --> 2680.8799999999997
fall they will fall and like everything

2677.72 --> 2680.8799999999997
will be undone

2682.44 --> 2687.7200000000003
like it's like Black Rock Vanguard will

2685.88 --> 2690.88
be completely

2687.72 --> 2697.9599999999996
defaulted and all the the assets will

2690.88 --> 2697.96
just like return to the state they're in

2707.079 --> 2711.2000000000003
that's going to happen eventually it

2708.88 --> 2714.2400000000002
might take a little

2711.2 --> 2716.0
longer right because now we're still

2714.24 --> 2718.4399999999996
dealing with the

2716.0 --> 2720.44
governments that are helping all of it

2718.44 --> 2722.44
out that are creating crisis for Black

2720.44 --> 2724.64
Rock Vanguard to buy everything up once

2722.44 --> 2727.04
they're gone the Black Rock Vanguard are

2724.64 --> 2730.16
still going to be out there

2727.04 --> 2732.96
still continuing just a little slower

2730.16 --> 2734.96
but they already got so much it will be

2732.96 --> 2738.48
like a theocracy just trying to take

2734.96 --> 2738.48
over world power more

2740.64 --> 2747.4
openly do I think capitalism is Nature's

2744.4 --> 2747.4
policy

2749.04 --> 2757.72
no no no you see it's Robber Baron

2753.72 --> 2762.5589999999997
capitalism that got us in this

2757.72 --> 2762.5589999999997
Place yeah this supposed

2763.04 --> 2769.92
capitalism made the robber

2765.8 --> 2774.079
barons made the novo re made the

2769.92 --> 2777.559
Eugenics creeps like it made that whole

2774.079 --> 2780.8390000000004
generation or generation that whole

2777.559 --> 2783.8
class next to the nobility mingling in

2780.839 --> 2787.2799999999997
with them sort of and that created these

2783.8 --> 2791.04
this group that is rolling this

2787.28 --> 2791.0400000000004
out they used

2792.119 --> 2798.8
capitalism crony capitalism because

2795.4 --> 2801.76
capitalism will always be crony Capital

2798.8 --> 2807.44
non- crony capitalism only works in a

2801.76 --> 2807.44
society where everybody is absolutely

2807.52 --> 2813.48
honorable and

2809.4 --> 2816.079
behaves like like a noble person like

2813.48 --> 2818.079
that's the only place normal cap Capal

2816.079 --> 2821.76
ISM can

2818.079 --> 2824.1600000000003
work if there's Corruption of any sort

2821.76 --> 2826.44
it will become crony capitalism and that

2824.16 --> 2829.2799999999997
is what led to this [ __ ] situation

2826.44 --> 2832.48
we're all in right now that's exactly

2829.28 --> 2834.88
what it is robber barons buying

2832.48 --> 2837.68
everything up screwing everybody

2834.88 --> 2839.96
over corruption corruption and then

2837.68 --> 2842.24
suddenly they own everything that's

2839.96 --> 2845.2400000000002
because of capitalism turned to crony

2842.24 --> 2848.64
capitalism which will always happen in a

2845.24 --> 2849.7999999999997
non ideal society and ideal societies

2848.64 --> 2854.5989999999997
don't

2849.8 --> 2858.079
exist so it is the idealism trap of

2854.599 --> 2861.1600000000003
capitalism that's very similar to the

2858.079 --> 2864.04
the the the idealist trap of

2861.16 --> 2866.92
communism because yeah it all works

2864.04 --> 2870.16
ideally but it never

2866.92 --> 2872.92
does so capitalism will always lead to

2870.16 --> 2875.1189999999997
crony capitalism to Mega robber barons

2872.92 --> 2878.64
owning everything screwing everybody

2875.119 --> 2883.48
over for petty reasons and communism

2878.64 --> 2885.839
always leads to a bunch of

2883.48 --> 2888.2
dictators that will pretty much do the

2885.839 --> 2890.7599999999998
same thing as the robber barons except

2888.2 --> 2893.3999999999996
they will do it in the name of the

2890.76 --> 2897.599
state it's not even that much different

2893.4 --> 2897.599
it's the same damn thing and it always

2904.64 --> 2907.64
happens

2922.559 --> 2928.3590000000004
God as a mega

2925.319 --> 2930.96
what belong to God yeah I don't know why

2928.359 --> 2934.5989999999997
people say that it's [ __ ] this just

2930.96 --> 2936.119
dumb personification

2934.599 --> 2938.2400000000002
nonsense

2936.119 --> 2940.88
I'm not going to refer to God as

2938.24 --> 2944.3999999999996
anything that is associated

2940.88 --> 2944.4
with human

2951.559 --> 2958.6800000000003
structures and if anything the only

2954.28 --> 2958.6800000000003
Capital God has are human

2964.52 --> 2967.52
beings

2989.319 --> 2997.52
there ship the

2992.359 --> 2997.52
patriarch patriarchal driven what

3003.079 --> 3007.319
what what kind of question is

3024.44 --> 3027.44
that

3031.28 --> 3036.0400000000004
right ownership is just a legal

3036.599 --> 3042.96
thing right so for example in China

3040.24 --> 3045.9599999999996
communist China there is there isn't

3042.96 --> 3048.68
such a thing as ownership is you get

3045.96 --> 3052.0
it's more feudal you just get the right

3048.68 --> 3054.8799999999997
to deal with it for the state and they

3052.0 --> 3056.76
can take it anytime they want that's but

3054.88 --> 3059.799
it's prac practically the same thing

3056.76 --> 3064.4
whether you have the right to to manage

3059.799 --> 3067.24
it or whether you own it doesn't really

3064.4 --> 3069.319
matter it only matters like in legal

3067.24 --> 3072.04
cases where in communist

3069.319 --> 3073.68
China like legally you have absolutely

3072.04 --> 3075.4
no right if they want to take it for

3073.68 --> 3077.5589999999997
whatever reason because they feel like

3075.4 --> 3080.28
it they take it and there's nothing you

3077.559 --> 3083.2400000000002
can do on a capitalist country yeah the

3080.28 --> 3087.3590000000004
government can't do

3083.24 --> 3087.359
that that's it

3088.599 --> 3091.4
that's really the

3106.319 --> 3111.839
difference is that patriarchal I don't

3109.24 --> 3114.359
know I don't know the context of that

3111.839 --> 3117.359
word don't

3114.359 --> 3117.359
understand

3120.77 --> 3123.849
[Music]

3123.88 --> 3131.799
unless you don't pay your taxes

3127.76 --> 3133.4
right yeah well that's just capitalizing

3131.799 --> 3135.68
in on

3133.4 --> 3137.4700000000003
that on that

3135.68 --> 3138.839
ownership

3137.47 --> 3142.0789999999997
[Music]

3138.839 --> 3142.0789999999997
yeah good

3142.16 --> 3147.359
point originally by the way like that

3144.92 --> 3148.799
idea of like even paying taxes for

3147.359 --> 3153.64
ownership

3148.799 --> 3156.16
is like people like shot other people

3153.64 --> 3159.68
through the face in the past in the

3156.16 --> 3159.68
United States for that sort of

3160.52 --> 3166.68
suggestion I wish they'd do that again I

3163.76 --> 3169.76
wish the United States would actually

3166.68 --> 3174.24
start going back to their old mechanisms

3169.76 --> 3176.079
instead of this this soup of

3174.24 --> 3177.7599999999998
corruption

3176.079 --> 3180.76
greed

3177.76 --> 3180.76
capitalism

3183.64 --> 3190.72
nonsense take the taxes away all of it

3187.28 --> 3192.119
let the government collapse like [ __ ]

3190.72 --> 3195.319
you

3192.119 --> 3196.6800000000003
government like send the bureaucrats

3195.319 --> 3200.88
back on the

3196.68 --> 3204.16
street like screw you what the [ __ ] have

3200.88 --> 3208.44
you done it's a giant [ __ ]

3204.16 --> 3208.44
hole and you're just

3208.52 --> 3214.7599999999998
parasiting no taxes just

3211.559 --> 3218.079
gone yeah if there's a real government

3214.76 --> 3220.6800000000003
that's really needed then they will

3218.079 --> 3223.44
present themselves they will just show

3220.68 --> 3223.44
you like

3223.599 --> 3229.52
yeah if we don't maintain this we're all

3226.839 --> 3232.16
[ __ ] and then the people can decide

3229.52 --> 3234.16
like yeah that makes

3232.16 --> 3236.24
sense

3234.16 --> 3239.3999999999996
right

3236.24 --> 3242.16
and the rest of them can all [ __ ]

3239.4 --> 3246.4
off everybody can just go back to their

3242.16 --> 3246.3999999999996
business and not pay taxes at

3247.92 --> 3253.04
all until like there's things that they

3251.119 --> 3255.319
really need and then you have to pay

3253.04 --> 3259.48
taxes cuz it's like yeah but now you're

3255.319 --> 3259.48
using something that requires

3261.76 --> 3266.44
maintenance and then it will just be

3263.92 --> 3268.319
like a really or know basic government

3266.44 --> 3270.76
where it's just like yeah the government

3268.319 --> 3272.64
takes care of some large utilities like

3270.76 --> 3279.119
the water

3272.64 --> 3279.1189999999997
system or electricity or gas supply

3281.52 --> 3285.559
right things that by the way should all

3284.079 --> 3289.52
be

3285.559 --> 3293.52
nationalized really like

3289.52 --> 3293.52
power leaving that to

3294.079 --> 3299.6400000000003
corporations

3296.839 --> 3301.88
H well yeah leaving it to government it

3299.64 --> 3303.48
all depends I mean they can both [ __ ]

3301.88 --> 3306.1600000000003
with you that's really the problem isn't

3303.48 --> 3308.559
it it's not like oh well we just

3306.16 --> 3310.3999999999996
nationalize it then the corporations

3308.559 --> 3315.3590000000004
Can't Screw with us anymore yeah but

3310.4 --> 3318.359
what if the government then screws with

3315.359 --> 3320.88
you right and then corporations that are

3318.359 --> 3322.839
not like political not your Genesis they

3320.88 --> 3326.96
might take it over and they do a great

3322.839 --> 3332.359
job they just be like operation should

3326.96 --> 3332.359
be right it all depends on who has

3337.64 --> 3341.7599999999998
control who's actually doing

3346.0 --> 3352.48
it the he mean Grove not

3349.16 --> 3352.48
grave D

3353.44 --> 3357.7200000000003
306 yeah that that's old

3361.07 --> 3364.089
[Music]

3364.599 --> 3367.599
stuff

3367.69 --> 3370.909
[Music]

3372.64 --> 3381.72
right right but a big issue in this age

3377.96 --> 3383.64
is there are certain figures out there

3381.72 --> 3387.0
that have too much

3383.64 --> 3390.1189999999997
money and they are completely spoiled

3387.0 --> 3392.24
and rotten down by the Devil

3390.119 --> 3395.44
Himself whether they believe in that or

3392.24 --> 3398.9599999999996
not I don't give a [ __ ] they're totally

3395.44 --> 3402.88
corrupted the only things they do is

3398.96 --> 3404.16
create terrible things in the world and

3402.88 --> 3407.6800000000003
they should

3404.16 --> 3412.7599999999998
be well effectively arrested and rolled

3407.68 --> 3418.0789999999997
up like all of it like all of it like

3412.76 --> 3421.6800000000003
yeah you will ow nothing and be happy

3418.079 --> 3424.599
yeah Elite you will owe nothing and be

3421.68 --> 3427.0
happy and it will actually be true

3424.599 --> 3431.6800000000003
you'll probably be happy for the very

3427.0 --> 3434.24
first time in your life not having this

3431.68 --> 3437.0789999999997
giant Satan

3434.24 --> 3439.5989999999997
treasure and this drive this push from

3437.079 --> 3441.52
the inside to just like just to try to

3439.599 --> 3444.28
distract away from your inner hell

3441.52 --> 3447.079
destroy things yeah you have to

3444.28 --> 3449.1600000000003
relinquish everything you got like have

3447.079 --> 3452.6800000000003
absolutely nothing

3449.16 --> 3452.68
nothing totally

3453.319 --> 3458.5589999999997
nothing have all those assets all

3456.48 --> 3463.039
nationalized everywhere in the world

3458.559 --> 3468.28
just like poof no more

3463.039 --> 3470.76
gigantic wealth demons if they're gone

3468.28 --> 3473.799
that's going to like really improve the

3470.76 --> 3476.7990000000004
world a lot it really

3473.799 --> 3476.799
will

3479.52 --> 3484.0389999999998
and I think also that this should be

3482.52 --> 3486.079
like

3484.039 --> 3488.119
done

3486.079 --> 3493.319
logically like

3488.119 --> 3497.559
more like these insane rich

3493.319 --> 3500.2799999999997
people like that shouldn't even be

3497.559 --> 3503.7200000000003
allowed like at

3500.28 --> 3506.2400000000002
all like at all

3503.72 --> 3509.2799999999997
anywhere

3506.24 --> 3511.3999999999996
what what good does any person with that

3509.28 --> 3515.8390000000004
amount of money actually

3511.4 --> 3520.119
do yeah they have so much it's like

3515.839 --> 3520.119
doing good for the world hurts

3521.359 --> 3528.52
them because they have too

3524.52 --> 3531.359
much people shouldn't even be capable of

3528.52 --> 3531.359
having that

3531.64 --> 3537.0389999999998
much and that's where my weird idea of

3535.079 --> 3540.48
conservative communism comes in it's

3537.039 --> 3542.5200000000004
like yeah no yeah it's cool that people

3540.48 --> 3544.359
should be able to build wealth and be

3542.52 --> 3546.079
bigger and all that and then there

3544.359 --> 3548.44
should be

3546.079 --> 3552.48
limits there should be a a point where

3548.44 --> 3552.48
it's like yeah it's

3552.52 --> 3557.44
enough you're not going to become

3557.88 --> 3564.839
bigger to hear and know

3562.0 --> 3567.48
further and if you try to go further we

3564.839 --> 3568.96
like you will be disbanded we will take

3567.48 --> 3572.799
all of

3568.96 --> 3575.68
it like your entire Corporation whatever

3572.799 --> 3578.16
the hell it is trust Foundation it will

3575.68 --> 3578.16
all be

3581.24 --> 3586.52
nullified or like anti monopolization

3584.44 --> 3589.7200000000003
laws right so it will I mean doesn't

3586.52 --> 3592.2
have to all be taken out completely but

3589.72 --> 3595.839
checked out everything and then

3592.2 --> 3598.8799999999997
like compartmentalize separate

3595.839 --> 3602.7599999999998
to smaller organizations that do

3598.88 --> 3605.6800000000003
that if it is feasible

3602.76 --> 3609.2000000000003
financially and just like break it apart

3605.68 --> 3611.5589999999997
break those conspiracy power blocks

3609.2 --> 3613.8799999999997
those giant capitalists that are like

3611.559 --> 3617.079
literally trying to like get control

3613.88 --> 3620.599
over everything like the devil it

3617.079 --> 3620.599
shouldn't even be

3620.88 --> 3626.559
possible that opportunity shouldn't even

3624.0 --> 3626.559
exist

3629.16 --> 3633.68
like at all with

3637.88 --> 3644.88
anyone and I mean anyone not a single

3641.64 --> 3644.8799999999997
person in the

3647.76 --> 3652.6400000000003
world there's no person in the world

3650.559 --> 3656.6400000000003
that's ever had that amount of money

3652.64 --> 3659.72
that didn't do terrible things with with

3656.64 --> 3662.2799999999997
it or if there were like you could

3659.72 --> 3665.4399999999996
literally like note them on one hand and

3662.28 --> 3667.96
I'm talking about world

3665.44 --> 3671.64
history people that have that amount of

3667.96 --> 3674.119
wealth don't do any good they never

3671.64 --> 3674.1189999999997
[ __ ]

3674.599 --> 3680.3590000000004
do so why is it

3677.64 --> 3683.7599999999998
allowed why is it allowed for that to

3680.359 --> 3686.44
exist when it never does any good to

3683.76 --> 3686.44
anything

3774.799 --> 3780.839
[ __ ] details like

3777.4 --> 3783.64
that they're all disgusting miserable

[Music]

3803.279 --> 3806.279
monsters

3829.359 --> 3836.279
what is the esoteric meaning of

3831.559 --> 3836.279
government taxing things we own

3836.72 --> 3840.8799999999997
well it's just a racket I mean

3838.839 --> 3844.44
government is a protection racket that

3840.88 --> 3848.6800000000003
can be functional or dysfunctional

3844.44 --> 3850.52
teret right it's just the big guy being

3848.68 --> 3853.1189999999997
the protection well the protection

3850.52 --> 3855.68
requires money that money is taxes

3853.119 --> 3855.6800000000003
that's the

3859.48 --> 3865.68
function so if there's a lot of crime

3862.88 --> 3868.039
you really want want to pay those taxes

3865.68 --> 3869.5989999999997
because you'll have government

3868.039 --> 3873.5200000000004
protection

3869.599 --> 3876.96
legally for that for those

3873.52 --> 3879.279
goods but if there's absolutely no crime

3876.96 --> 3882.44
whatsoever

3879.279 --> 3885.119
then You' be more inclined to say screw

3882.44 --> 3887.68
you government why the hell would I pay

3885.119 --> 3887.6800000000003
you for

3887.839 --> 3891.7599999999998
this just because I own

3893.16 --> 3896.16
it

3907.68 --> 3912.5989999999997
right and hey a protection racket can be

3909.96 --> 3915.319
a total extortion business or it can

3912.599 --> 3918.079
simply be

3915.319 --> 3922.64
security you get

3918.079 --> 3925.7200000000003
it protection business can be a racket

3922.64 --> 3931.5989999999997
extortion racket or it can simply be

3925.72 --> 3931.5989999999997
security it all depends on who's in

3932.2 --> 3937.8799999999997
control government simply can be

3934.96 --> 3940.559
security or it can be an extortion

3937.88 --> 3943.119
Racket and that's exactly how we

3940.559 --> 3943.119
experience

3944.76 --> 3951.0
it I like good government that is like a

3948.16 --> 3953.839
security it secures

3951.0 --> 3954.64
things it makes it more safe more stable

3953.839 --> 3959.0789999999997
more

3954.64 --> 3962.319
reliable less to worry about is

3959.079 --> 3963.96
great yeah but if they're just extorting

3962.319 --> 3967.119
things they don't really care about the

3963.96 --> 3967.92
people they're just thereare to rub off

3967.119 --> 3970.6400000000003
your

3967.92 --> 3975.4
resources yeah that's

3970.64 --> 3978.48
horrendous and eventually self-defeating

3975.4 --> 3982.1600000000003
because they are dependent on those they

3978.48 --> 3986.0
parasite on and that will lead them to a

3982.16 --> 3986.0
bad end inevitably

3986.279 --> 3989.279
so

3992.799 --> 3996.7599999999998
right but I mean if you don't have a

3995.079 --> 3999.559
government what you're just going to

3996.76 --> 4002.1600000000003
have a security group don't you get it

3999.559 --> 4004.599
ter that's what's going to happen like

4002.16 --> 4007.2
oh no more government Anarchy yeah guess

4004.599 --> 4009.079
what's going to happen next whole bunch

4007.2 --> 4011.52
of security companies are going to be

4009.079 --> 4014.6400000000003
there we'll protect it it's only cost

4011.52 --> 4018.72
this much it'll be like yes yes yeah

4014.64 --> 4021.799
guess what that's a hyper basic

4018.72 --> 4024.359
government is just securing the place

4021.799 --> 4024.359
that's what it

4032.88 --> 4039.48
is from a spirit mechanics

4036.2 --> 4042.3999999999996
perspective do they think they want

4039.48 --> 4045.92
us to think they have committed those

4042.4 --> 4045.92
atrocities yes

4048.799 --> 4055.0389999999998
absolutely they want you to hate them to

4051.76 --> 4059.5200000000004
think they're ter they want your energy

4055.039 --> 4062.3190000000004
to Spill and suck move towards them yeah

4059.52 --> 4065.48
they want to attract all of it cuz if

4062.319 --> 4068.279
it's moving from you to them you think

4065.48 --> 4069.44
about them terribly your energy is going

4068.279 --> 4074.319
to

4069.44 --> 4075.68
them and not to you or your family or

4074.319 --> 4077.359
whatever you were doing or whatever you

4075.68 --> 4079.72
were investing in is literally

4077.359 --> 4083.24
distracting they're

4079.72 --> 4086.72
vampiring your energy by spreading

4083.24 --> 4090.0789999999997
rumors of how horrible they

4086.72 --> 4093.319
are which is a lot of the times real and

4090.079 --> 4095.48
sometimes it isn't real and they still

4093.319 --> 4097.48
like they love it when people come up

4095.48 --> 4102.359
with crazy conspiracy theories about

4097.48 --> 4104.44
them they literally love it some of them

4102.359 --> 4108.400000000001
love it so much that they

4104.44 --> 4110.839
oops say it on some live

4108.4 --> 4114.92
broadcast they think this about me yeah

4110.839 --> 4117.359
that's because you love it you love it

4114.92 --> 4119.839
you want to be seen as the devil you

4117.359 --> 4122.159000000001
want everybody to pointed you like oh

4119.839 --> 4125.4
that is the evil one that's causing my

4122.159 --> 4127.96
life to be terrible they want it they

4125.4 --> 4130.92
love it it's all your energy all

4127.96 --> 4130.92
surrendering to

4132.799 --> 4136.359
them Mission

4138.56 --> 4144.92
successful and that's why I never chew

4141.199 --> 4146.839
myself up over individuals anymore evil

4144.92 --> 4149.88
blatantly evil individuals I don't chew

4146.839 --> 4152.64
myself up over them I just see them as

4149.88 --> 4154.4800000000005
Psychopaths that need to be cut off from

4152.64 --> 4156.88
all feeling

4154.48 --> 4159.44
forever like you can't care about

4156.88 --> 4161.6
anything that concerns them you can't

4159.44 --> 4165.2789999999995
have any feelings about anything that

4161.6 --> 4167.719
concerns them and at all they have to be

4165.279 --> 4167.719
super

4168.6 --> 4174.159000000001
cold cuz any little bit of feeling you

4171.96 --> 4177.199
might have towards them will literally

4174.159 --> 4180.879999999999
make them more powerful and you more

4177.199 --> 4183.839
weaker that's how it

4180.88 --> 4185.6
works so in the end it doesn't matter

4183.839 --> 4190.44
what atrocities they

4185.6 --> 4190.4400000000005
committed at all it's only a

4192.0 --> 4196.92
distraction to the task at hand of

4195.04 --> 4205.189
getting them

4196.92 --> 4205.189
[Music]

4213.48 --> 4221.799999999999
[Music]

4216.08 --> 4221.8
out no tear it no it doesn't work like

4222.64 --> 4225.64
that

4225.84 --> 4230.56
they don't do those acts for

4246.92 --> 4255.159
fun just heyet how about we don't

4251.32 --> 4259.5199999999995
[ __ ] talk about this

4255.159 --> 4262.44
yeah go retreat in some snuff film

4259.52 --> 4268.96
dungeon and watch that [ __ ] all day long

4262.44 --> 4271.36
for a liare how you don't draw it into

4268.96 --> 4271.36
my

4272.719 --> 4279.08
chat

4275.52 --> 4283.2390000000005
yeah go dwell and some torture dungeon

4279.08 --> 4286.4
somewhere else teret don't do that in my

4283.239 --> 4289.678999999999
chat don't bring it

4286.4 --> 4292.159
here don't bring your thoughts about

4289.679 --> 4294.1990000000005
that in my chat thank you very

4292.159 --> 4297.159
much

4294.199 --> 4300.879999999999
yeah you want to be the slave of it you

4297.159 --> 4300.879999999999
go be the slave of it somewhere

4304.56 --> 4310.2390000000005
else nothing you feel about it is going

4308.159 --> 4312.5599999999995
to change

4310.239 --> 4315.5599999999995
anything positive or

4312.56 --> 4315.56
negative

4316.14 --> 4323.87
[Music]

4324.92 --> 4330.1990000000005
just heard Santos say yes Santos is

4327.679 --> 4330.1990000000005
[ __ ]

4341.04 --> 4345.48
[Music]

4342.48 --> 4345.48
[ __ ]

4352.76 --> 4357.719
why

4354.04 --> 4361.239
the ah never mind it's just why the hell

4357.719 --> 4361.2390000000005
would you even listen to that

4372.44 --> 4375.44
guy

4402.56 --> 4409.6
okay yeah and it doesn't work that

4406.28 --> 4413.48
way like you can't

4409.6 --> 4416.400000000001
compare like there Savage acts to like

4413.48 --> 4418.678999999999
incr incre

4416.4 --> 4421.36
incrementalism with policies that they

4418.679 --> 4424.4800000000005
roll out for example right cuz if

4421.36 --> 4427.759999999999
everybody buys into those then they

4424.48 --> 4430.5199999999995
continue make it worse do they you don't

4427.76 --> 4432.76
buy into it yeah that's not the same

4430.52 --> 4434.1990000000005
thing as some disgusting things that

4432.76 --> 4437.679
they might do

4434.199 --> 4437.678999999999
behind closed doors or

4438.32 --> 4443.0
whatever it's not the same it's not like

4440.88 --> 4447.1990000000005
oh if you ignore that they'll do more of

4443.0 --> 4448.76
it no and even if if they would like

4447.199 --> 4451.12
what the [ __ ] are you going to do about

4448.76 --> 4453.84
it like run in with the machine gun and

4451.12 --> 4456.639
grenades and just blow it all up good

4453.84 --> 4459.96
luck just do that then stop [ __ ]

4456.639 --> 4461.92
talking about it okay talking about is

4459.96 --> 4464.76
not going to change anything it's just

4461.92 --> 4468.08
going to spread more hor and misery and

4464.76 --> 4470.92
a lot of people feeling sick not really

4468.08 --> 4473.44
knowing what to do about it yeah that's

4470.92 --> 4477.6
the only thing that

4473.44 --> 4477.599999999999
spreads it's not changing

4485.48 --> 4491.199
anything the vision yeah I don't know

4488.92 --> 4493.28
what the [ __ ] Visions he had but we

4491.199 --> 4495.919999999999
didn't have the same Visions can guar

4493.28 --> 4495.92
guarantee you

4511.76 --> 4516.400000000001
that and it's not really Visions it's

4514.32 --> 4519.44
mostly One Vision I

4516.4 --> 4521.799999999999
had that breed into the future which is

4519.44 --> 4521.799999999999
really

4522.199 --> 4526.599999999999
magical

4523.92 --> 4530.52
and other than that it's

4526.6 --> 4530.52
not yeah it's

4531.8 --> 4536.56
just a

4534.32 --> 4539.679
feeling a

4536.56 --> 4542.4800000000005
hint just something esoteric telling me

4539.679 --> 4544.2390000000005
like this is happening this is that that

4542.48 --> 4546.12
is that but it's not because of the

4544.239 --> 4549.08
Visions it's not like oh I'm reflecting

4546.12 --> 4551.12
that to the experience I had and then I

4549.08 --> 4553.32
can conclude it's real no no it's

4551.12 --> 4555.199
literally separate from that it's just

4553.32 --> 4557.679
the four

4555.199 --> 4560.48
feeling I used to have a lot of that it

4557.679 --> 4563.6
was really strong when I was young the

4560.48 --> 4566.28
vision [ __ ] actually damaged it

4563.6 --> 4570.4400000000005
slightly it made it less capable it

4566.28 --> 4570.44
distracted me away from

4578.88 --> 4585.52
that he's seen the Judgment yeah sure he

4582.4 --> 4588.879999999999
did yeah yeah you know what the funny

4585.52 --> 4592.719
thing is a lot in the dark world is just

4588.88 --> 4595.6
it's not actually real it's a simulation

4592.719 --> 4598.4
you don't actually get to see the real

4595.6 --> 4601.360000000001
things you just get to see an

4598.4 --> 4604.28
emulation of what it feels like or how

4601.36 --> 4607.12
you imagine things to be that's what you

4604.28 --> 4609.12
get to see you don't actually get to see

4607.12 --> 4610.76
the real things except for a few

4609.12 --> 4612.239
occasions where I literally get to see

4610.76 --> 4615.08
through other people's eyes which is

4612.239 --> 4615.08
really bizarre

4617.8 --> 4623.4400000000005
but with the most future things it it

4620.719 --> 4627.08
doesn't work like

4623.44 --> 4629.0
that it's like yeah I got to see the

4627.08 --> 4631.159
imagination of

4629.0 --> 4634.639
myself in the

4631.159 --> 4637.96
future that is in the knowledge but I

4634.639 --> 4637.96
only get to see the

4638.08 --> 4644.0
imagining because I am not lit like when

4642.4 --> 4648.28
that happen

4644.0 --> 4652.48
My Future Self is not literally in those

4648.28 --> 4656.199
places literally experiencing those

4652.48 --> 4658.799999999999
things but I am getting the news putting

4656.199 --> 4662.28
it together thinking about it with the

4658.8 --> 4665.679
knowledge that I have and that

4662.28 --> 4668.0
Vision based on having things put

4665.679 --> 4670.76
together of like what is happening right

4668.0 --> 4673.92
now even of current events that well 20

4670.76 --> 4678.08
years ago I would have known that part I

4673.92 --> 4678.08
do get to see in the simulation

4679.719 --> 4687.08
yeah so I got to see the

4682.6 --> 4689.92
imaginings of myself in the future not

4687.08 --> 4689.92
the literal

4697.48 --> 4702.0
things but the interesting thing is is

4700.08 --> 4704.159
because I spend so much time like

4702.0 --> 4706.76
putting things to together of how things

4704.159 --> 4706.759999999999
work out

4708.04 --> 4713.639
there the

4710.08 --> 4716.239
Visions concerning that that I have seen

4713.639 --> 4719.76
in the dark world because of my activity

4716.239 --> 4722.28
in the 3D normal world have become quite

4719.76 --> 4724.52
cohesive and clear so I had a really

4722.28 --> 4724.5199999999995
good

4726.08 --> 4731.639
foresight that was even like not just

4729.199 --> 4734.638999999999
there to excite right A lot of people

4731.639 --> 4737.4400000000005
imagine things used their imagination to

4734.639 --> 4740.32
make things more thrilling exciting less

4737.44 --> 4743.36
boring yeah well I don't really do

4740.32 --> 4745.5599999999995
that cuz I'm kind of easily

4743.36 --> 4747.719
overstimulated so I don't do that

4745.56 --> 4749.92
typically I just try to figure out how

4747.719 --> 4752.159
things really are in the chaos of

4749.92 --> 4754.92
people's minds

4752.159 --> 4758.12
like

4754.92 --> 4761.08
reality is chaotic but people's minds

4758.12 --> 4761.08
make it even

4761.84 --> 4764.84
worse

4766.92 --> 4773.36
and my mind does not thank

4770.52 --> 4775.2390000000005
God I mean I roll out some complicated

4773.36 --> 4778.159
thoughts sometimes but I'm always trying

4775.239 --> 4778.159
to make things more

4779.54 --> 4783.96
[Music]

4781.76 --> 4785.52
simple but to make things more simple

4783.96 --> 4788.56
you have to be honest and by being

4785.52 --> 4791.4400000000005
honest you automatically thread and in

4788.56 --> 4794.84
places that are not comfortable do not

4791.44 --> 4797.199
seem simple but the only real simple

4794.84 --> 4803.08
method is to actually go

4797.199 --> 4803.08
The Not So seemingly simple

4806.639 --> 4816.2390000000005
path to compare the saying like is it uh

4812.199 --> 4816.239
soothing doctors leave stinking

4817.04 --> 4823.5199999999995
wounds right while doctor that yeah that

4820.84 --> 4825.400000000001
makes it hurt

4823.52 --> 4827.56
they like clean up the wound is very

4825.4 --> 4831.599999999999
painful but yeah those will actually

4827.56 --> 4831.6
heal properly the idea about

4833.04 --> 4840.239
that oh it applies to to life and

4838.08 --> 4841.84
everything you just got to be rough you

4840.239 --> 4843.28
got to be straightforward you got to be

4841.84 --> 4846.2390000000005
honest

4843.28 --> 4849.599999999999
especially when it's inconvenient yeah

4846.239 --> 4849.599999999999
convenience is

4851.719 --> 4856.56
evil

4854.04 --> 4859.159
this is which is hilarious

4856.56 --> 4863.56
because it's like one of the driving

4859.159 --> 4863.5599999999995
factors of Western Society is

4863.639 --> 4870.84
convenience but convenience effectively

4866.48 --> 4874.759999999999
is evil it makes people

4870.84 --> 4877.52
evil it leaves more time then often that

4874.76 --> 4880.84
time is not spent more

4877.52 --> 4883.400000000001
productively but

4880.84 --> 4888.88
spoiled that's what convenient does

4883.4 --> 4888.879999999999
convenience gives you a lot of time to

4889.12 --> 4893.08
waste to do more

4902.52 --> 4907.0
damage now of course it'd be crazy to

4905.56 --> 4910.679
bypass UNC

4907.0 --> 4912.88
conveniences but by the nature of it it

4910.679 --> 4915.52
it's just everything is conveniently

4912.88 --> 4918.08
there is everything is super easy it's

4915.52 --> 4920.280000000001
going to give you a lot of time to waste

4918.08 --> 4924.32
and do more

4920.28 --> 4927.4
damage people never end up using that

4924.32 --> 4930.12
extra time that was saved with the

4927.4 --> 4934.04
convenience to do better

4930.12 --> 4937.239
things like statistically that never

4934.04 --> 4940.56
happens this is very

4937.239 --> 4943.5599999999995
telling you'd hope it would but it

4940.56 --> 4946.96
doesn't it doesn't actually

4943.56 --> 4946.96
create more

4962.4 --> 4966.92
productivity could have make a

4964.199 --> 4968.678999999999
distinction between them and Nightmares

4966.92 --> 4970.92
well there is not much distinction

4968.679 --> 4975.36
because if you just get to see

4970.92 --> 4977.4
things super rough without any

4975.36 --> 4980.759999999999
reservations of

4977.4 --> 4982.799999999999
humanity well then the point is is that

4980.76 --> 4985.52
when you get to see it all you also get

4982.8 --> 4988.04
to see The Nightmares and they are just

4985.52 --> 4991.080000000001
nightmares reality has nightmares really

4988.04 --> 4993.04
nightmarish things that I got to see and

4991.08 --> 4996.04
feel up

4993.04 --> 4996.04
close

4997.199 --> 5001.08
unexpectedly and sometimes in

4999.159 --> 5005.0
overwhelming amount because it takes

5001.08 --> 5005.0
place in overwhelming amount in

5006.0 --> 5011.12
reality so there is no

5009.12 --> 5013.84
distinction between visions and

5011.12 --> 5018.36
Nightmares because nightmares were part

5013.84 --> 5018.360000000001
of the Visions they were not

5021.08 --> 5026.04
separated just what made them

5023.44 --> 5029.36
nightmarish is that I couldn't actually

5026.04 --> 5034.48
handle them that I got so shocked that

5029.36 --> 5034.48
it shuddered my will to oversee

5036.239 --> 5041.199
off and that was used by entities

5049.28 --> 5056.4
there hello tin foil cat

5053.04 --> 5056.4
what who are

5061.36 --> 5064.36
you

5065.52 --> 5069.120000000001
that's a hilarious picture by the

5085.32 --> 5089.639
way man I've been ranting on and

5091.119 --> 5095.28
on oh man still

5121.28 --> 5124.28
raing

5147.679 --> 5151.28
what the hell am I going to title

5148.96 --> 5154.28
Today's

5151.28 --> 5154.28
Show

5170.76 --> 5176.639
said so many things I just can't really

5173.239 --> 5180.44
put like figure out a title for it I was

5176.639 --> 5180.4400000000005
trying to think of it even as I was

5181.0 --> 5184.199
talking uh

5190.88 --> 5195.56
feed was too chaotic yeah that's a good

5193.199 --> 5198.239
one tinfo

5195.56 --> 5201.119000000001
cat it that's not even unreasonable

5198.239 --> 5204.799999999999
thing to do because like my feet is

5201.119 --> 5208.719
completely like they're so forcing

5204.8 --> 5211.1990000000005
things on you like people rarely even

5208.719 --> 5212.88
get like really new

5211.199 --> 5216.0
things

5212.88 --> 5217.8
anymore you just get force fed a lot of

5216.0 --> 5220.92
typical

5217.8 --> 5222.84
stuff and if you subscribe to certain

5220.92 --> 5225.08
type of people like the the

5222.84 --> 5226.76
recommendations never become anything

5225.08 --> 5229.96
else than just those things you've

5226.76 --> 5229.96
subscribed to it's very

5236.4 --> 5243.638999999999
annoying like I've actually considered

5239.4 --> 5245.5599999999995
unsubscribing from certain channels just

5243.639 --> 5248.36
because the freaking recommendations

5245.56 --> 5248.360000000001
about them wouldn't

5271.119 --> 5274.119
stop

5278.199 --> 5285.96
yeah but I mean these times are very

5281.44 --> 5289.638999999999
very different from say 20160 and

5285.96 --> 5292.159
70 man back then it's like whoa another

5289.639 --> 5294.6
flat earther that's awesome subscribe

5292.159 --> 5297.679
and like like oh what is he talking

5294.6 --> 5301.2390000000005
about oh was it was all just new and

5297.679 --> 5303.84
fresh now it's like oh so you're a flat

5301.239 --> 5307.638999999999
earther okay

5303.84 --> 5307.639
what kind of a flat earther are

5312.08 --> 5317.199
you cuz it doesn't necessarily have to

5314.92 --> 5319.639
be

5317.199 --> 5322.5199999999995
good there's like flat earthers out

5319.639 --> 5326.08
there that just kind of perpetuate [ __ ]

5322.52 --> 5328.119000000001
videos like really superficial

5326.08 --> 5331.0
[ __ ] it's

5328.119 --> 5333.28
just

5331.0 --> 5335.76
boring

5333.28 --> 5337.8
and I mean yeah my life videos I mean

5335.76 --> 5340.320000000001
it's not like the most riveting

5337.8 --> 5343.0
attention grabbing show in the world I

5340.32 --> 5344.679
know I have like big silent moments and

5343.0 --> 5348.199
all that I

5344.679 --> 5351.159
know but at least when I bring up things

5348.199 --> 5354.44
I do actually get a

5351.159 --> 5357.96
point I'm not just sing settling for

5354.44 --> 5360.599999999999
some superficial conspiracy rhetoric and

5357.96 --> 5363.92
then thinking like that's all that I

5360.6 --> 5363.92
don't do that [ __ ]

5365.199 --> 5373.919999999999
I try to put down genuine thoughts and

5368.96 --> 5376.6
ideas and insights on how things work or

5373.92 --> 5380.4400000000005
how I think they

5376.6 --> 5383.679
work i' I'm perceiving situations that

5380.44 --> 5385.678999999999
might arrive or that have arrived and

5383.679 --> 5388.2390000000005
that's what I typically do and yeah

5385.679 --> 5390.92
those generic Flat Earth conspiracy

5388.239 --> 5393.44
videos definitely don't do

5390.92 --> 5396.04
that

5393.44 --> 5397.759999999999
a lot of them just recycled that intro

5396.04 --> 5400.28
information oh have you ever thought of

5397.76 --> 5401.360000000001
the Earth being flat this is what it

5400.28 --> 5404.44
looks like

5401.36 --> 5407.719
iness to the globe model this and then

5404.44 --> 5407.719
then it's like yeah

5420.84 --> 5423.84
yeah

5424.84 --> 5431.52
space Finds Its way into

5426.88 --> 5434.96
everything yeah but I mean space is very

5431.52 --> 5438.4800000000005
popular as a storytelling medium I mean

5434.96 --> 5441.719
I like it like I don't want to get rid

5438.48 --> 5446.199
of space I think it's a great toy box

5441.719 --> 5449.8
it's like a Sandbox except it's in

5446.199 --> 5453.08
space right I like space I don't want to

5449.8 --> 5454.0
get rid of space it's just not real that

5453.08 --> 5457.6
is

5454.0 --> 5460.52
all right is Narnia

5457.6 --> 5462.400000000001
real so if it's not real does that mean

5460.52 --> 5464.6
that we can't read the books we can't

5462.4 --> 5467.679
enjoy it we can't think about it we

5464.6 --> 5472.4400000000005
can't use the metaphors yeah we damn

5467.679 --> 5475.1990000000005
well can as long as you know it's not

5472.44 --> 5478.199
real so why can't we just do that with

5475.199 --> 5478.199
space that would be

5478.239 --> 5483.5599999999995
awesome I do that with space I literally

5481.44 --> 5486.5599999999995
do that that like on the Flat Earth

5483.56 --> 5488.719
debates on my own shows why not it's not

5486.56 --> 5491.88
a

5488.719 --> 5494.6
problem right it's just the things that

5491.88 --> 5497.36
are the problems are [ __ ]

5494.6 --> 5499.400000000001
astrophysicists and all that that tell

5497.36 --> 5502.88
you things that are just blatantly

5499.4 --> 5502.879999999999
Incorrect and made

5504.4 --> 5511.5199999999995
up right people that try to derail your

5508.639 --> 5514.88
mind in order for you to believe it's

5511.52 --> 5518.1990000000005
actually real that's the problem it's

5514.88 --> 5520.32
the convincing people it is real that

5518.199 --> 5523.08
makes them completely Mis understand

5520.32 --> 5525.88
physical reality that is the problem

5523.08 --> 5526.88
it's not that there is a space Medium as

5525.88 --> 5529.119
a

5526.88 --> 5531.32
story that's not the problem it's the

5529.119 --> 5532.88
problem people trying to convince others

5531.32 --> 5536.159
that it's actually

5532.88 --> 5539.84
real and thereby derailing their entire

5536.159 --> 5542.28
Minds that is the problem it's not the

5539.84 --> 5545.4400000000005
storytelling medium

5542.28 --> 5548.159
I mean you could freaking well screw up

5545.44 --> 5550.96
Narnia if you had a bunch of Narnia

5548.159 --> 5555.159
physicists that would continually

5550.96 --> 5557.36
explain how it works and why it's real

5555.159 --> 5560.36
and where the closet is and if we can

5557.36 --> 5563.119
expect more closets to be made if what

5560.36 --> 5565.08
type of wood it would be of right and if

5563.119 --> 5567.599999999999
that was in the public and you'd get

5565.08 --> 5573.159
that [ __ ] like on

5567.6 --> 5575.84
TV and get mentions in government and

5573.159 --> 5578.32
advertisements and big Mega corporate

5575.84 --> 5580.84
yeah yeah then it would become a problem

5578.32 --> 5582.32
too Narnia physicist would become a

5580.84 --> 5584.719
problem because they would continually

5582.32 --> 5587.199
be derailing

5584.719 --> 5589.199
people in their understanding about

5587.199 --> 5593.759999999999
physical reality because they're trying

5589.199 --> 5596.28
to reify Narnia fiction into reality

5593.76 --> 5596.280000000001
that's a

5597.32 --> 5603.5599999999995
problem but the Narnia books Chronicles

5600.88 --> 5606.28
of Narnia they are not the problem it's

5603.56 --> 5609.280000000001
the people that are trying to reide into

5606.28 --> 5611.48
physical reality derailing people's

5609.28 --> 5613.04
understanding about physical reality

5611.48 --> 5617.08
that is the

5613.04 --> 5619.96
problem so the same counts for

5617.08 --> 5621.92
space space science fiction I don't have

5619.96 --> 5624.04
a problem with it I have a problem with

5621.92 --> 5628.8
people that are derailing other people's

5624.04 --> 5628.8
minds by trying to reified into physical

5630.56 --> 5633.56
reality

5636.07 --> 5640.04
[Music]

5637.52 --> 5642.080000000001
but they're not saying Narnia is real

5640.04 --> 5645.04
though yeah but they could and then

5642.08 --> 5645.04
you'd have the same

5660.48 --> 5663.48
problem

5684.24 --> 5690.48
[Applause]

okay hope this title sort of makes

5780.32 --> 5783.32
sense

5784.96 --> 5789.119
what fibro what's going

5787.56 --> 5792.320000000001
on

5789.119 --> 5792.32
Hospital what

5799.52 --> 5805.400000000001
happened just stress I'm

5802.4 --> 5805.4
hoping

5810.28 --> 5817.239
what left arm

5813.6 --> 5817.2390000000005
tingling why would that

5817.44 --> 5825.119
be it's not a typical thing that

5820.0 --> 5825.119
happened this morning left arm was not

5831.6 --> 5837.4400000000005
okay okay have you chucked some vitamin

5834.84 --> 5840.1990000000005
C very

5837.44 --> 5843.199
important first thing to

5840.199 --> 5843.199
do

5843.52 --> 5848.040000000001
eekg

5845.04 --> 5848.04
Jesus

5850.36 --> 5853.36
okay

5858.68 --> 5861.899
[Music]

5870.199 --> 5873.199
EKG

5884.0 --> 5890.52
really good shape workout the time okay

5888.04 --> 5894.199
hey twit

5890.52 --> 5894.1990000000005
wit good to see you

5895.719 --> 5900.119
again that would be stressed make yeah

5898.159 --> 5902.5599999999995
but I'm just kind of curious like

5900.119 --> 5905.159
why

5902.56 --> 5908.360000000001
because I mean sometimes I go to sleep

5905.159 --> 5910.239
and then like I I fall asleep in an

5908.36 --> 5912.119
awkward position with my arm and then

5910.239 --> 5913.759999999999
it's like all cut off with blood and I

5912.119 --> 5916.4
don't feel it the next day it's like

5913.76 --> 5920.52
this dead limb right can be pretty

5916.4 --> 5923.5199999999995
messed up but I never get like breathing

5920.52 --> 5923.52
problems

5925.719 --> 5933.119
so have you just tried chugging a bunch

5929.4 --> 5933.119
of vitamin C

5949.4 --> 5953.48
maybe time for a new mattress

5955.04 --> 5964.28
maybe but again fiber out have you tried

5959.84 --> 5964.28
chugging a bunch of vitamin

5965.639 --> 5971.2390000000005
C I mean that literally would be the

5968.56 --> 5973.0
very very first thing I do as soon as I

5971.239 --> 5975.28
notice something like that will be going

5973.0 --> 5978.28
on with me like

5975.28 --> 5978.28
immediately

5978.44 --> 5983.678999999999
immediately like how can how can you not

5981.48 --> 5988.598999999999
do that how can you choose to go to the

5983.679 --> 5988.599
hospital before you try that I don't get

5990.04 --> 5993.04
it

6008.04 --> 6013.639
I mean it might not necessarily even

6010.96 --> 6017.599
work that much but I don't get it like

6013.639 --> 6020.639
why would I would like always try that

6017.599 --> 6022.119000000001
first I mean a hospital is it's like a

6020.639 --> 6026.4400000000005
last Resort

6022.119 --> 6030.199
thing it costs [ __ ] tons of money and

6026.44 --> 6030.199
gives gets you in all kinds of weird

6030.84 --> 6037.4400000000005
positions especially now I mean with

6034.32 --> 6040.0
breathing troubles dude you're like oh

6037.44 --> 6043.4
breathing troubles hospital

6040.0 --> 6045.04
really in a new coid period thing that's

6043.4 --> 6046.92
happening and you're thinking oh

6045.04 --> 6049.92
breathing trouble hospital that's the

6046.92 --> 6051.679
first thing you're thinking of

6049.92 --> 6053.52
wow

6051.679 --> 6057.4800000000005
oh you're really lucky they don't just

6053.52 --> 6057.4800000000005
intubate you and get you killed

6064.4 --> 6072.44
then cuz that's what they typically do

6067.119 --> 6072.44
during coid Crisis crisis if you

6072.54 --> 6075.619
[Music]

6134.0 --> 6139.159
C at home you're [ __ ]

6139.76 --> 6146.04
insane especially now for multiple front

6146.239 --> 6155.638999999999
reasons why don't you have vitamin

6150.56 --> 6158.84
C at the ready you need Vitamin C at the

6155.639 --> 6159.96
ready always like always have that

6158.84 --> 6161.96
doesn't mean that you have to

6159.96 --> 6165.88
continually use it but you always have

6161.96 --> 6168.56
to have it always especially now

6165.88 --> 6172.76
especially with the co co

6168.56 --> 6172.76
crap and the extra stress

6176.52 --> 6183.96
like you'll take your chances at the

6179.56 --> 6188.56
hospital well why don't you just try it

6183.96 --> 6191.639
first like not breathing good quickly

6188.56 --> 6195.599
get some vitamin C in me yeah just give

6191.639 --> 6198.1990000000005
it like 15 minutes if it's absolutely no

6195.599 --> 6200.1990000000005
difference whatsoever yeah then maybe

6198.199 --> 6204.5599999999995
call the hospital but how can you not

6200.199 --> 6207.36
try vitamin C first I don't get

6204.56 --> 6211.4800000000005
it buying another four pounds of vitamin

6207.36 --> 6214.5199999999995
C salt awesome soowon buggy good on you

6211.48 --> 6218.36
it's like you got to try that first man

6214.52 --> 6218.360000000001
like especially with breathing

6220.159 --> 6229.119
issues you take a vitamin C sub that's

6224.0 --> 6231.52
cool I me too right but that's cool

6229.119 --> 6234.159
every day that's great

6231.52 --> 6236.2390000000005
sometimes though I need more because I'm

6234.159 --> 6240.0
getting weird shoulder

6236.239 --> 6242.199
issues right when it hurts I don't get

6240.0 --> 6244.119
breathing issues thank God but I do get

6242.199 --> 6246.36
shoulder issues and can be really

6244.119 --> 6250.36
distracting and then when I get that

6246.36 --> 6252.598999999999
it's like ah the flare period it's like

6250.36 --> 6255.88
when the fungi go around and then they

6252.599 --> 6257.2390000000005
also go around in my body right like

6255.88 --> 6259.2390000000005
different periods in the year that

6257.239 --> 6262.44
happens typically in Spring and

6259.239 --> 6265.28
typically around autumn

6262.44 --> 6269.36
when that happens I take triple dose of

6265.28 --> 6272.119
vitamin C and just

6269.36 --> 6275.0
gone and then and eventually I have to

6272.119 --> 6279.239
stop doing that again build it down

6275.0 --> 6279.239
again but I mean that works

6279.92 --> 6284.08
fantastic yeah you can't overd those

6282.119 --> 6287.04
that's right don't pee it out yeah and

6284.08 --> 6289.5599999999995
that's a bit of a waste to just have so

6287.04 --> 6293.76
much of it you just pee it

6289.56 --> 6297.96
out like don't try to waste it but the

6293.76 --> 6300.639
point is it's so safe and easy and cheap

6297.96 --> 6303.679
and it it really does miracles on

6300.639 --> 6306.159000000001
multiple fronts it's not just oh it just

6303.679 --> 6309.0
does this little thing no vitamin c does

6306.159 --> 6311.239
so many different good things all over

6309.0 --> 6311.239
your

6312.679 --> 6320.08
body starting to use avocado

6316.599 --> 6322.679

6322.679 --> 6328.8

6326.04 --> 6332.0
weird sure let me know what that's

6328.8 --> 6332.0

6334.96 --> 6341.96

6353.0 --> 6357.48
long time and it doesn't really seem to

6355.04 --> 6357.48
work for

6357.84 --> 6364.32
me vitamin C works great B12 works

6367.239 --> 6372.04
great and the rest of the supplements

6369.56 --> 6375.8

and horny goatweed oh wait no that's not

6379.56 --> 6383.04

6393.48 --> 6400.44
the mayonnaise brands that I

6395.88 --> 6400.4400000000005

6409.4 --> 6412.4
based

6415.48 --> 6421.36
B12 is keeping that glorious head of

6418.52 --> 6421.360000000001

6439.119 --> 6446.159
mayonnaise what the hell like they don't

6442.8 --> 6451.2390000000005

6460.84 --> 6467.4800000000005
mayonnaise it's fantastic it's all

6463.48 --> 6467.48
organic uses actual

6467.56 --> 6473.56
eggs it's great

6470.96 --> 6477.28
best mayonnaise I've come across thus

6473.56 --> 6481.719
far mayonnaise is easy to make yeah

6477.28 --> 6481.719
guess you have to have the components

6499.239 --> 6502.239
though

6509.4 --> 6516.32
I'd be very curious to try mayonnaise

6511.76 --> 6519.1990000000005
that was made at the by Owen Benjamin's

6516.32 --> 6521.4
wife that would be

6519.199 --> 6524.799999999999
amazing cuz they're very they could

6521.4 --> 6527.849999999999
definitely do that at this

6524.8 --> 6527.85
[Music]

6529.199 --> 6534.32
point

6531.48 --> 6537.959999999999
but yeah I'm always a big fan of good

6534.32 --> 6537.96
mayonnaise I eat a

6540.159 --> 6545.5199999999995
lot it is like one of the better sources

6542.76 --> 6545.52
of fats for

6559.119 --> 6562.119
me

6568.0 --> 6573.8
yeah

6569.84 --> 6573.8
C that Canadian

6575.159 --> 6579.199
right no fed today

6580.159 --> 6584.4
correct no Nathan's computer still is

6583.08 --> 6587.199
not

6584.4 --> 6589.119
fixed at

6587.199 --> 6592.119
least

6589.119 --> 6592.119
what

6618.84 --> 6622.360000000001
now Dro suddenly want to come on but I

6620.84 --> 6625.96
mean I'm already kind of

6622.36 --> 6628.08
toast and getting hungry I I need to get

6625.96 --> 6631.28
out in this terrible weather to get

6628.08 --> 6634.96
lunch or to get eggs so I get to so I

6631.28 --> 6634.96
can get lunch make

6638.04 --> 6645.4
it do I put it on

6641.199 --> 6647.239
fries yeah arguably yeah on fries but I

6645.4 --> 6650.239
when I eat french

6647.239 --> 6655.28
fries I also I make a French french

6650.239 --> 6658.839999999999
fries with war so I use saté sauce with

6655.28 --> 6658.84
chopped onions and

6659.4 --> 6663.719
mayonnaise it's the best combination

6667.239 --> 6674.079
ever I mean just mayonnaise and Fries

6670.719 --> 6678.079
yeah that's it's okay but it's really

6674.079 --> 6678.079
not super fulfilling

6678.76 --> 6686.76
though heard that a European thing yeah

6681.88 --> 6686.76
yeah it is it's the best

6687.199 --> 6693.04
cheese not on French

6689.56 --> 6695.52
fries no no gravy no cheese that's

6693.04 --> 6695.5199999999995
totally

6698.079 --> 6702.679
wrong I mean there's like something like

6701.159 --> 6706.159
french

6702.679 --> 6710.639
fries hair dresser or something CS

6706.159 --> 6713.5199999999995
Salon where they just like take like

6710.639 --> 6716.28
and french fries and they just pour meat

6713.52 --> 6718.159000000001
like they pour like cheese over it like

6716.28 --> 6720.639
that doesn't make any damn sense I don't

6718.159 --> 6720.638999999999
eat that

6722.239 --> 6729.04
[ __ ] I guess it it works as a dinner but

6726.599 --> 6731.119000000001
it's not my

6729.04 --> 6733.96
thing but I mean there are many

6731.119 --> 6737.0
different ways you can have your French

6733.96 --> 6739.44
fries and I really like it when it's

6737.0 --> 6741.199
like mayonnaise saté sauce with chopped

6739.44 --> 6744.04
onions

6741.199 --> 6747.199
and I make it myself all

6744.04 --> 6750.48
organic it's not even that much

6747.199 --> 6751.5599999999995
work just take a little little bit of

6750.48 --> 6755.718999999999
saté

6751.56 --> 6758.04
sauce chunks put it like in a little

6755.719 --> 6760.56
little pan with a little layer of water

6758.04 --> 6763.8
and just mix it up while you're like

6760.56 --> 6767.4800000000005
heating up your oil for the french fries

6763.8 --> 6770.4800000000005
and just keep mixing it and like keep

6767.48 --> 6772.799999999999
stirring it until it's right and then

6770.48 --> 6776.718999999999
you just you got your sat sauce like

6772.8 --> 6778.04
tiny one person amounts it's really not

6776.719 --> 6783.0
that much

6778.04 --> 6783.0
work and it is it tastes absolutely

6784.599 --> 6787.599
fantastic

6789.4 --> 6794.079
gross B GOI fries

6797.76 --> 6802.360000000001
what right but the the point is is that

6800.84 --> 6805.84
french fries with

6802.36 --> 6808.0
war with the saté sauuce and the onions

6805.84 --> 6811.159000000001
you can eat that and actually be

6808.0 --> 6815.4
fulfilled if you just take french fries

6811.159 --> 6817.839999999999
and with mayonnaise yeah it's cool as a

6815.4 --> 6820.598999999999
snack but you're going to get hungry

6817.84 --> 6822.76
again well if you do french fries with

6820.599 --> 6826.599
Wars with the sé sauce good quality

6822.76 --> 6830.119000000001
important and a little bit of cut fresh

6826.599 --> 6831.719
onions well then you actually feel the

6830.119 --> 6835.44
like you've had a

6831.719 --> 6838.719
meal that's the difference you actually

6835.44 --> 6841.719
get act yeah satisfied and the saté

6838.719 --> 6844.96
sauce contains a lot of stuff and the

6841.719 --> 6847.2390000000005
fresh cut onions are well fresh cut

6844.96 --> 6849.4800000000005
vegetables it works much better on the

6847.239 --> 6849.48
long

6850.56 --> 6854.2390000000005
run all right anyway yeah just talking

6853.44 --> 6857.719
to

6854.239 --> 6861.678999999999
dros he's going to come on tomorrow so

6857.719 --> 6861.679
we're going to try again tomorrow

6867.36 --> 6871.5599999999995
though that will be cool on the Saturday

6881.8 --> 6888.719
show have a good

6885.04 --> 6892.239
day oh you're going I think I was going

6888.719 --> 6892.2390000000005
to kind of round out

6918.599 --> 6921.599
somewhere

6924.21 --> 6927.38
[Music]

6933.98 --> 6937.419999999999
[Music]

6945.159 --> 6950.28
do I debate like fed

6947.76 --> 6952.400000000001
no no I don't have the the patience for

6950.28 --> 6955.48
that at all didn't full

6952.4 --> 6955.48
cat I

6956.639 --> 6964.400000000001
mean the point is is I get so agitated

6961.079 --> 6967.199
and I'm so tired of like somebody

6964.4 --> 6969.04
thinking that they really got it well

6967.199 --> 6971.678999999999
it's like arguments that I've heard

6969.04 --> 6975.079
literally a thousand times it is so

6971.679 --> 6978.159
tedious to me like actual debating is

6975.079 --> 6978.159
really tedious to

6978.52 --> 6986.599
me and I Endure Ballers when they get a

6983.88 --> 6989.639
ball tarded like a kumu virus I just

6986.599 --> 6991.88
endure it I'm like yeah but he's he's

6989.639 --> 6994.84
really cool when he's not whining about

6991.88 --> 6999.679
ball tarded beliefs so like I can

6994.84 --> 7003.96
tolerate it but I mean it's so annoying

6999.679 --> 7006.92
like I I can tell you like calmly like

7003.96 --> 7009.159
all the the logic and the evidence but I

7006.92 --> 7011.76
usually just save that kind of thing for

7009.159 --> 7015.759999999999
face to face

7011.76 --> 7017.52
situations when somebody's like oh but

7015.76 --> 7019.360000000001
when I'm trying to explain like yeah the

7017.52 --> 7021.96
Earth is actually flat and then they

7019.36 --> 7024.199
roll out the standard response oh but

7021.96 --> 7026.639
what about this or what about that and

7024.199 --> 7028.96
then I I have to make the effort to

7026.639 --> 7032.159000000001
immediately answer

7028.96 --> 7034.2390000000005
it just to show like no but I'm actually

7032.159 --> 7036.5599999999995
really un control like to make them feel

7034.239 --> 7039.5199999999995
like wow it seems like you've been doing

7036.56 --> 7042.360000000001
this a lot since you have an immediate

7039.52 --> 7044.96
logical response to every reflex

7042.36 --> 7046.839999999999
question I asked right that's what I

7044.96 --> 7050.199
save that kind of thing for because it

7046.84 --> 7053.8
does drain you but at least then it

7050.199 --> 7055.839999999999
works it then actually tends to work it

7053.8 --> 7058.1990000000005
did recently I mean I had somebody roll

7055.84 --> 7060.88
over in their car like hey I talked to

7058.199 --> 7062.839999999999
you recently about the Earth being flat

7060.88 --> 7064.079
well I took some look into this and and

7062.84 --> 7066.360000000001
you were

7064.079 --> 7067.92
right and then I shook his hand it was

7066.36 --> 7070.5199999999995
pretty

7067.92 --> 7073.119
cool and really

7070.52 --> 7075.52
unexpected right but that's because I

7073.119 --> 7078.719
save the actual debating things the

7075.52 --> 7081.079000000001
energy for those face to face moments

7078.719 --> 7083.04
because people are much more receptable

7081.079 --> 7086.239
in face Toof face situation well if you

7083.04 --> 7090.599
do it online many more of them will just

7086.239 --> 7093.48
be like I hate you at home whine about

7090.599 --> 7096.400000000001
the format and then go away it's a waste

7093.48 --> 7098.839999999999
the time to do it in my opinion in my

7096.4 --> 7101.48
experience debating Flat Earth with

7098.84 --> 7104.159000000001
globers is online is actually kind of a

7101.48 --> 7105.879999999999
waste of energy and I don't want to

7104.159 --> 7109.598999999999
waste my energy on

7105.88 --> 7112.36
that personally I like like

7109.599 --> 7115.2390000000005
psychoanalysis and like narrative

7112.36 --> 7117.119
analysis and magician trickery analysis

7115.239 --> 7120.04
I love that that's why I love to hang

7117.119 --> 7122.239
around fed and I will definitely talk

7120.04 --> 7124.92
about flat earth related things there

7122.239 --> 7127.959999999999
and the psychology of it right that's

7124.92 --> 7129.76
great but when it's actually debating a

7127.96 --> 7132.32
globe where I I don't really get

7129.76 --> 7135.119000000001
involved too much right unless it's like

7132.32 --> 7137.599
kind of being laughy it's like ha look

7135.119 --> 7140.36
at that like what

7137.599 --> 7143.88
really but I mean Nathan does the real

7140.36 --> 7146.44
chewing he is just like the the the

7143.88 --> 7148.4400000000005
factory worker of Flat Earth really

7146.44 --> 7151.759999999999
Nathan is really like the ultimate

7148.44 --> 7153.96
Factory he just does all the thing and

7151.76 --> 7158.0
he does it very consistently very

7153.96 --> 7159.92
smoothly perfectly all the details I

7158.0 --> 7162.239
don't have the patience to just do that

7159.92 --> 7165.4800000000005
over and over and over I just don't have

7162.239 --> 7167.759999999999
it but I do have that patience and that

7165.48 --> 7171.079
passion in face Toof face situations

7167.76 --> 7171.079000000001
because I've seen it

7171.28 --> 7176.759999999999
work in contrast to like doing that

7174.32 --> 7179.199
online it doesn't work online it does in

7176.76 --> 7181.639
face to- face situations if you spend

7179.199 --> 7184.4
all your energy throwing it overboard

7181.639 --> 7185.8
doing it online not seeing success well

7184.4 --> 7188.5599999999995
then you're not really going to have

7185.8 --> 7192.04
that energy to succeed in face Toof face

7188.56 --> 7194.4800000000005
situations now will you so that's why I

7192.04 --> 7196.96
don't focus on doing that all the time

7194.48 --> 7200.36
like for example flat soid I think that

7196.96 --> 7203.4800000000005
if flat soide went face to face with

7200.36 --> 7205.719
people about Flat Earth about the globe

7203.48 --> 7208.239
I don't think he he'd have a lot of

7205.719 --> 7209.119
energy for that because he spends all of

7208.239 --> 7211.839999999999
his

7209.119 --> 7214.199
energy with that sort of thing

7211.84 --> 7217.4800000000005
online that's what he does it's his

7214.199 --> 7220.919999999999
stick it's his his

7217.48 --> 7223.959999999999
thing I don't do that

7220.92 --> 7227.04
thing but because I don't do that thing

7223.96 --> 7229.4800000000005
in face to face situations I am actually

7227.04 --> 7232.88
successful with

7229.48 --> 7232.879999999999
it that's the

7235.84 --> 7241.639
difference Nathan is more of a yeller

7238.44 --> 7242.919999999999
than a Vader no he's not the yelling

7241.639 --> 7246.4400000000005
only

7242.92 --> 7250.159
starts when somebody rasses the [ __ ] out

7246.44 --> 7253.199
of the actual arguments

7250.159 --> 7254.759999999999
yeah that's really when the the yelling

7253.199 --> 7257.159
well not even yelling just getting

7254.76 --> 7260.56
louder it's not yelling it's

7257.159 --> 7264.5599999999995
just getting a more strict tone yeah

7260.56 --> 7268.119000000001
projecting much aruana 6 numpty [ __ ]

7264.56 --> 7271.679
huh projecting much I know you

7268.119 --> 7271.679
are you all

7274.04 --> 7282.159
yell complaining about format

7278.04 --> 7285.159
huh I know how that

7282.159 --> 7285.159
works

7290.96 --> 7298.84
right but yeah I will give arguments but

7294.04 --> 7301.88
I'm not going to like give you the full

7298.84 --> 7304.639
debate I'm not going to like reot your

7301.88 --> 7308.079
anti Flat Earth

7304.639 --> 7310.4800000000005
mations it's too tedious and you know it

7308.079 --> 7313.239
is that's why it works you just create

7310.48 --> 7316.119
something so elaborate it's too tedious

7313.239 --> 7320.919999999999
to try to reut it that's your tactic

7316.119 --> 7324.079
just swamp everybody into like giving

7320.92 --> 7327.56
up that's the anti flatter Earth tactic

7324.079 --> 7329.92
swamping you with garbage that's too

7327.56 --> 7334.04
tiresome to

7329.92 --> 7335.76
reot and it works works on me when I see

7334.04 --> 7338.079
anti flat earthers do that I'm just

7335.76 --> 7340.4800000000005
immediately like just getting the [ __ ]

7338.079 --> 7343.719
out of my face

7340.48 --> 7347.159
just you better not do that [ __ ] in face

7343.719 --> 7350.88
to face situation you really seriously

7347.159 --> 7354.839999999999
risk an assault if you do that [ __ ] to

7350.88 --> 7356.96
my face is actually happened one time

7354.84 --> 7359.28
where somebody did that sort of thing I

7356.96 --> 7361.4
almost punched him full force in the

7359.28 --> 7362.719
face and then I didn't do it I just let

7361.4 --> 7365.4
him

7362.719 --> 7367.8
talk and then just looked at him like

7365.4 --> 7369.879999999999
very sharply straight in his eyes to

7367.8 --> 7373.4400000000005
make him real like you know how [ __ ]

7369.88 --> 7376.639
offensive it is what you just did how

7373.44 --> 7381.04
disrespectful to somebody you don't

7376.639 --> 7381.04
know and then they usually figure it

7391.04 --> 7397.48
out so yeah Nathan not a

7394.28 --> 7399.719
yeller but he does get a little bit more

7397.48 --> 7401.28
loud when he gets rumpus during his

7399.719 --> 7404.32
concise

7401.28 --> 7406.84
explanations that is

7404.32 --> 7408.5599999999995
correct right anyway I'm going to round
