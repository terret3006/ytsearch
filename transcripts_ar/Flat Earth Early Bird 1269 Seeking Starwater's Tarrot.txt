that system they have torches too shells

1203.36 --> 1207.6999999999998
clubs or something shells would be coins

1209.659 --> 1212.74

1412.88 --> 1416.48
with this card

1414.26 --> 1419.299

hmm

1464.6 --> 1470.84
yeah yeah that's what I got from that

1466.76 --> 1474.02
too it's funny because I was directed

1470.84 --> 1475.8799999999999
towards it I literally just like picked

1474.02 --> 1479.24
intuitively

1475.88 --> 1482.419
and opened the book at the right page

1479.24 --> 1484.4
instantly now that's a sign I know it is

1482.419 --> 1488.539
I don't care what people say about that

1484.4 --> 1491.14
I know it is I know how this works

1488.539 --> 1491.14
huh

1493.7 --> 1496.5800000000002
but yeah this is actually kind of

1495.5 --> 1499.279
welcome

1496.58 --> 1501.6789999999999
it's a welcome type of message because

1499.279 --> 1503.9
I also have like the counter side of

1501.679 --> 1506.179
that

1503.9 --> 1508.039
that I sort of seem to feel like the

1506.179 --> 1511.22
opposite

1508.039 --> 1513.3799999999999
I downplay myself so it's good to have

1511.22 --> 1517.039
it then just

1513.38 --> 1519.919
set cleanly without like your shadow of

1517.039 --> 1522.14
your own mind interrupting the the train

1519.919 --> 1523.94
of thought which is what happens when I

1522.14 --> 1529.039
kind of

1523.94 --> 1531.6200000000001
just add myself and think about it yeah

1529.039 --> 1534.08
very cool

1531.62 --> 1536.1789999999999
anybody else wants me to pick a card for

1534.08 --> 1540.34
them

1536.179 --> 1540.3400000000001
you'll be surprised how well that works

1550.63 --> 1553.8290000000002
[Music]

1556.72 --> 1568.469
[Music]

1575.72 --> 1580.9
you're very happy right oh so am I thank

1578.48 --> 1583.94
you very much seeking star water

1580.9 --> 1586.1200000000001
it's a really cool deck it has a good

1583.94 --> 1586.1200000000001
energy

1596.9 --> 1600.0690000000002
[Music]

1605.659 --> 1608.8600000000001
so anybody

1614.94 --> 1619.79
[Music]

1642.74 --> 1648.32
hmm

1645.02 --> 1652.58
that that is interesting flutter Sage

1648.32 --> 1656.0
well you know the thing about tarot is

1652.58 --> 1660.279
there's a it's basically it can be

1656.0 --> 1660.279
multiple things at the same time it

1660.32 --> 1666.62
when you do tarot reading

1663.559 --> 1669.98
it allows you to use

1666.62 --> 1671.0
the medium of the cards to relay a

1669.98 --> 1674.96
message

1671.0 --> 1678.14
that is outside of the cart that you

1674.96 --> 1681.08
know about from The Real World

1678.14 --> 1684.5590000000002
but there's a chance the person you're

1681.08 --> 1688.34
doing the tarot reading for doesn't

1684.559 --> 1690.62
right so if you just like randomly told

1688.34 --> 1692.9599999999998
a person like dude this and this is

1690.62 --> 1695.0
gonna happen they'd be like what the

1692.96 --> 1698.539
[ __ ] leave me alone

1695.0 --> 1701.059
but if you're in a tarot reading

1698.539 --> 1705.22
You're Expecting

1701.059 --> 1707.48
prediction right as the one doing that

1705.22 --> 1711.02
so guess what

1707.48 --> 1715.46
sadly the tarot person doing that for

1711.02 --> 1717.1399999999999
you has an opportunity to lay down extra

1715.46 --> 1722.0
cards

1717.14 --> 1724.3990000000001
from his mind in effectively right to

1722.0 --> 1727.76
basically connect whatever's in the

1724.399 --> 1729.6789999999999
cards revealing itself to actual events

1727.76 --> 1731.779
they might see coming or they might

1729.679 --> 1735.799
understand about the person type that is

1731.779 --> 1739.46
in front of them yeah extra data

1735.799 --> 1741.799
it is about the action it is about the

1739.46 --> 1743.3600000000001
inquiry the inquiry of a person to

1741.799 --> 1746.84
somebody else

1743.36 --> 1749.779
in this very specific context it is like

1746.84 --> 1752.72
a game framework and if somebody

1749.779 --> 1755.659
inquires like that it's actually easier

1752.72 --> 1758.24
to communicate than if you just

1755.659 --> 1760.8990000000001
have a normal communication

1758.24 --> 1760.8990000000001
huh

1761.36 --> 1767.26
right pick one for you okay

1764.12 --> 1767.26

1803.36 --> 1807.9799999999998

1805.64 --> 1810.5590000000002
Word

1807.98 --> 1813.02
I don't know if that makes any sense to

1810.559 --> 1816.279

1813.02 --> 1816.279

1849.98 --> 1853.6

1974.299 --> 1979.279
get smart and you just look up the

1977.059 --> 1980.539
number and you'll find it quickly

1979.279 --> 1983.919
huh

1980.539 --> 1983.919
right nine torches

1984.22 --> 1987.799

consciousness of fire great strength

2014.62 --> 2019.84
through flexibility and calling upon

2019.84 --> 2022.899
struggle will be met

2021.45 --> 2025.059
[Music]

2022.899 --> 2027.1
Spirit of the nine torches is the

trigger that will Unleash Your full

2027.1 --> 2031.48

arrow

2031.48 --> 2037.059
where are you aiming at it

2034.48 --> 2040.3600000000001
in a draw this is a great indication

2037.059 --> 2042.519
that the situation will be resolved is a

2040.36 --> 2044.1999999999998
reminder of the powerful magic within

2042.519 --> 2047.14
you

2044.2 --> 2051.04

2047.14 --> 2055.139
questioning of purpose resilience look

2051.04 --> 2055.139
forward and remain adaptable

2055.659 --> 2062.26
on the defensive resolution of internal

2059.619 --> 2065.2000000000003
conflict wary of the world your scars

2062.26 --> 2067.599
are a Badge of Courage

2065.2 --> 2070.3199999999997
oh and then underneath there this is the

2067.599 --> 2070.32
end of Courage

2070.659 --> 2078.3
of Innocence The End of Innocence

2074.2 --> 2078.2999999999997
okay it's pretty dramatic

2080.219 --> 2083.699
[Music]

2091.599 --> 2098.5
right so it makes sense torches so fire

2095.879 --> 2100.359
Consciousness element of Consciousness

2098.5 --> 2104.339
in my

2100.359 --> 2104.339
right the four elements

2104.56 --> 2111.04
Body Spirit Soul Consciousness torch

2108.94 --> 2112.359
fire consciousness

2111.04 --> 2115.119
right

2112.359 --> 2117.7799999999997
so water

2115.119 --> 2117.78
ah

2118.359 --> 2124.9
yeah seems like the heavy con this like

2121.119 --> 2127.6600000000003
a very that's confrontation like

2124.9 --> 2130.359
highest flame means highest

2127.66 --> 2131.98
Consciousness also means the highest

2130.359 --> 2135.0989999999997
burden

2131.98 --> 2138.7
and usually like

2135.099 --> 2144.119
big transformation I'd say

2138.7 --> 2144.1189999999997
yeah that's my intuitive interpretation

2145.9 --> 2150.76
I don't want to be less however doesn't

2148.48 --> 2152.46
the Bible warn against this type of

2150.76 --> 2155.82
divination

2152.46 --> 2155.82
uh yeah

2155.859 --> 2160.2
yeah so don't screw around with it

2162.22 --> 2170.2599999999998
right take it serious

2165.82 --> 2172.06
know the person you're doing it with

2170.26 --> 2174.88
right if you're just gonna walk into

2172.06 --> 2176.099
some random

2174.88 --> 2178.44
yeah

2176.099 --> 2182.8
Gypsy camp

2178.44 --> 2185.2000000000003
tarot woman like do you know her do you

2182.8 --> 2186.94
know you could trust her right

2185.2 --> 2188.56
you know what you're actually what it is

2186.94 --> 2190.48
you're going to be doing or you just

2188.56 --> 2192.46
think it's all a joke

2190.48 --> 2194.7400000000002
right that's what I would say

2192.46 --> 2198.16
so yeah it's a tool it's it's spiritual

2194.74 --> 2201.7799999999997
take it serious and don't just like

2198.16 --> 2206.2
things like oh I don't like this card

2201.78 --> 2208.6600000000003
I'm gonna pick another one right that's

2206.2 --> 2210.22
when things go wrong as when you

2208.66 --> 2212.02
basically

2210.22 --> 2214.5989999999997
yeah

2212.02 --> 2216.52
might get obsessed

2214.599 --> 2218.579
or Escapist

2216.52 --> 2224.94
it's not even that different

2218.579 --> 2224.94
right it's just a tool just like guns

2227.38 --> 2232.6600000000003
you yeah if you mishandle guns people

2230.5 --> 2235.96
can get hurt

2232.66 --> 2237.16
right same goes for tarot cards in my

2235.96 --> 2240.64
opinion

2237.16 --> 2242.2599999999998
now it's not going to be that dramatic

2240.64 --> 2245.859
but yeah

2242.26 --> 2248.0200000000004
somebody can absolutely be led astray by

2245.859 --> 2250.66
like a fortune teller

2248.02 --> 2252.88
if that fortune teller is just trying to

2250.66 --> 2256.18
bind that person to them

2252.88 --> 2260.82
taking away like their personal resolve

2256.18 --> 2260.8199999999997
and making them need them instead

2262.9 --> 2267.94
not during the judging you know but I'm

2265.06 --> 2269.92
supplementing I'm supplementing what you

2267.94 --> 2272.44
said right because there is a point to

2269.92 --> 2276.16
it I'm not saying like oh that's all

2272.44 --> 2277.78
[ __ ] oh definition magic it's it's

2276.16 --> 2282.0989999999997
all natural

2277.78 --> 2286.48
and just as natural as just eating

2282.099 --> 2289.079
an apple right no no it's not

2286.48 --> 2289.079
right

2290.32 --> 2293.88
should be careful

2297.22 --> 2301.72
the problem comes when you don't take it

2299.56 --> 2303.7
serious

2301.72 --> 2304.4599999999996
that's when it actually becomes

2303.7 --> 2306.64
dangerous

2304.46 --> 2309.06
[Music]

2306.64 --> 2309.06
cam

2315.04 --> 2320.2799999999997
right so Jeff gassad you wanted the card

2317.8 --> 2320.28
as well

2324.52 --> 2331.2
due to Roman to me all right so who said

2328.96 --> 2331.2
that

2331.78 --> 2337.5600000000004
and that's kind of cut

2334.119 --> 2337.56
kind of cut in there

2352.66 --> 2355.2
all right

2357.64 --> 2360.2999999999997
hmm

2360.579 --> 2365.7000000000003
oh

2362.2 --> 2365.7
priest of fruits

2366.099 --> 2371.1600000000003
is that like a one

2368.56 --> 2371.16
hmm

2393.46 --> 2395.76
foreign

2398.339 --> 2401.52
priests right

2416.74 --> 2420.4199999999996
God wait no that's still

2421.9 --> 2426.88
priests

2423.76 --> 2431.079
ah yeah [ __ ]

2426.88 --> 2433.119
right so you got the priest of fruit

2431.079 --> 2435.76
that's

2433.119 --> 2438.46
there's a misprint

2435.76 --> 2440.619
serious

2438.46 --> 2444.16
it says Prince of fruits but it is

2440.619 --> 2447.599
priest of fruit that's weird

2444.16 --> 2447.5989999999997
I wonder I got confused

2447.64 --> 2452.5
uh

2449.8 --> 2455.26
and it is fully

2452.5 --> 2457.56
written out like that too it's Prince

2455.26 --> 2457.5600000000004
again

2458.26 --> 2461.28
there's something

2461.44 --> 2464.46
what's going on

2468.64 --> 2476.3799999999997
so is this a misprint on the card or in

2477.88 --> 2482.56
confused

2479.02 --> 2485.92
it should probably be

2482.56 --> 2488.46
the priest because it is in the row of

2485.92 --> 2488.46
priests

2489.579 --> 2493.26

Prince of fruits represents the thoughts

2535.24 --> 2541.72

here we see the prince slicing and

2541.72 --> 2546.819

3043.2 --> 3048.7799999999997

so I really hope that doesn't return

3093.18 --> 3097.02
all right because I just didn't think

3094.98 --> 3099.059
like that can't be the weather

3097.02 --> 3100.559
right makes no sense if it was the

3099.059 --> 3103.38
weather on the other hand the weather

3100.559 --> 3106.559
did kind of change that day

3103.38 --> 3108.98
from standard rainy that it had been to

3106.559 --> 3108.98
better

3117.78 --> 3124.5
because it's usually weather change like

3120.72 --> 3128.54
the actual change that gives me like

3124.5 --> 3128.54
physical ache problems and all that

3128.579 --> 3134.099

I've seen quite a few but

3298.2 --> 3300.2
um

3300.78 --> 3311.469
right so yeah that was pretty cool

3304.02 --> 3311.469
[Music]

3317.78 --> 3320.949
[Music]

3376.02 --> 3380.22
wow

3378.18 --> 3382.319
does that even mean

3380.22 --> 3389.7
ye shall not

3382.319 --> 3389.7
use enchantment nor observe times what

3391.73 --> 3396.9
[Music]

3394.98 --> 3399.48
if there's somebody in my chat that's

3396.9 --> 3401.04
like re I I think I stepped on their

3399.48 --> 3403.079
dick or something

3401.04 --> 3405.599
doing the tarot thing

3403.079 --> 3408.7200000000003
because they're now like squirting

3405.599 --> 3410.4
it's like see oh we knew it Arwin oh you

3408.72 --> 3413.52
see he's not a Christian after always

3410.4 --> 3415.98
evil he's actually the devil is

3413.52 --> 3420.14
condoning these things and

3415.98 --> 3420.14
like no no no no I accept that

3420.599 --> 3424.88
now let's see what that actually means

3435.48 --> 3438.68
hello Daniel Robles

3439.51 --> 3442.7990000000004
[Music]

3451.92 --> 3458.42
I mean

3453.54 --> 3458.42
you see if you're going to be nitpicky

3462.18 --> 3466.14
about people that I don't know like to

3464.64 --> 3469.02
use tarot

3466.14 --> 3471.68
occasionally

3469.02 --> 3474.9
well how about those churches that just

3471.68 --> 3477.54
openly and blatantly now accept

3474.9 --> 3481.64
homosexuality

3477.54 --> 3481.64
as in it's not a problem

3481.859 --> 3485.339
that seems a little bit more egregious

3483.9 --> 3488.819
don't you think

3485.339 --> 3491.16
than somebody like oh I yeah I like

3488.819 --> 3493.319
to row decks

3491.16 --> 3496.16
all right I like to play with dice

3493.319 --> 3496.16
something right

3496.5 --> 3502.079
I mean

3499.02 --> 3505.339
seems pretty straightforward

3502.079 --> 3505.3390000000004
what's more terrible

3511.319 --> 3515.2799999999997
I've been indoctrinated to hate

3512.76 --> 3518.579
spiritual tools

3515.28 --> 3520.5
well we haven't been it's just the

3518.579 --> 3523.26
slaves out there right

3520.5 --> 3525.48
I mean what better to keep people weak

3523.26 --> 3526.92
than through fear

3525.48 --> 3529.98
right

3526.92 --> 3532.319
fear of the number 33.

3529.98 --> 3533.88
pair of these

3532.319 --> 3537.7799999999997
symbols

3533.88 --> 3540.2400000000002
that are also being used by blatantly

3537.78 --> 3543.119
evil people and just like oh the

3540.24 --> 3547.02
blatantly evil people look they use this

3543.119 --> 3550.88
and that that means all of that was

3547.02 --> 3554.04
always evil yeah

3550.88 --> 3557.1600000000003
yeah no

3554.04 --> 3560.22
that means you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] and a

3557.16 --> 3564.42
coward and a savonier

3560.22 --> 3566.7
probably some kind of a trinitarian

3564.42 --> 3568.6800000000003
circled jerking

3566.7 --> 3570.299
magician

3568.68 --> 3572.7799999999997
that doesn't even realize they're a

3570.299 --> 3572.78
magician

3572.819 --> 3575.299
right

3576.96 --> 3580.099
and now I lost my point

3583.38 --> 3587.76
right I'm not afraid

3586.319 --> 3591.42
you see

3587.76 --> 3596.1600000000003
what I do is I claim it back

3591.42 --> 3598.6800000000003
saying yeah evil you've sat on that

3596.16 --> 3600.299
power that is a widely available to

3598.68 --> 3602.3999999999996
anybody

3600.299 --> 3604.74
like a dragon

3602.4 --> 3605.76
stinking up a pile of gold for long

3604.74 --> 3609.4799999999996
enough

3605.76 --> 3612.78
I'm just going to use that now without

3609.48 --> 3615.42
the fear without the predispositional

3612.78 --> 3617.099
thoughts about it has to be evil because

3615.42 --> 3621.02
I'm doing it right

3617.099 --> 3626.4
got my ring I made this myself this is a

3621.02 --> 3628.2
self-constructed symbol this is not evil

3626.4 --> 3635.28
right

3628.2 --> 3637.5
I claim it it's mine now you get it

3635.28 --> 3641.7000000000003
you can't take that from me and you

3637.5 --> 3643.14
can't intimidate me into relinquishing

3641.7 --> 3646.14
it

3643.14 --> 3649.2
because a group of people got

3646.14 --> 3652.02
indoctrinated like slaves about how

3649.2 --> 3654.0
everything is evil because evil uses

3652.02 --> 3655.799
certain things and that means those

3654.0 --> 3657.42
things are evil then because you're

3655.799 --> 3659.4
retards

3657.42 --> 3661.819
you literally don't know what the hell

3659.4 --> 3661.819
you're doing

3703.58 --> 3709.909
[Music]

3719.7 --> 3724.52
that's right George Sanford it is all

3721.619 --> 3724.52
about the intentions

3724.74 --> 3732.66
but it's also about the responsibility

3728.94 --> 3735.059
right if you're gonna claim power

3732.66 --> 3738.1189999999997
of any sort

3735.059 --> 3741.2000000000003
whether it's Financial

3738.119 --> 3741.2000000000003
power over the mind

3741.72 --> 3745.0789999999997
power

3743.339 --> 3747.72
over knowledge

3745.079 --> 3749.7000000000003
with every power comes a responsibility

3747.72 --> 3753.18
that's very specific

3749.7 --> 3754.9399999999996
and If you deny that but you still take

3753.18 --> 3758.52
the power

3754.94 --> 3761.9
that's when things go bad

3758.52 --> 3761.9
usually for everybody

3766.02 --> 3770.4
and if you can't take the power's

3768.48 --> 3773.039
responsibility because you can't

3770.4 --> 3776.299
understand it then you shouldn't be

3773.039 --> 3779.039
having that power and that power will

3776.299 --> 3781.14
reinforce that right it will start to

3779.039 --> 3784.6400000000003
curse you because you're actually not

3781.14 --> 3784.64

3892.799 --> 3895.7599999999998
that was pretty cool

3897.539 --> 3900.539
hmm

3937.559 --> 3941.28
yeah so you can start with it yeah

3939.0 --> 3944.16
that's what I got out of it

3941.28 --> 3946.6400000000003
and it seems pretty good it's it's very

3944.16 --> 3946.64
decent

3947.46 --> 3954.9
I mean it can absolutely use refinement

3951.359 --> 3958.44
but that's like the hazards of

3954.9 --> 3961.579
making any book or collection of writing

3958.44 --> 3965.119
I know all about it my DND book

3961.579 --> 3965.119
thousands of pages

3965.4 --> 3969.96
endless rewriting always right but I

3968.099 --> 3971.819
never like officially printed it or

3969.96 --> 3976.079
anything well I did like just print it

3971.819 --> 3976.079
out so I could take it with me but

3976.98 --> 3983.579
this was obviously like a

3980.16 --> 3986.0989999999997
like a first print type situation and

3983.579 --> 3987.8390000000004
it's good I liked it I like the feel of

3986.099 --> 3991.76
it like immediately

3987.839 --> 3991.7599999999998
it actually improved my mood

3991.859 --> 3997.44
are you an author

3994.799 --> 4000.52
well

3997.44 --> 4000.52
not officially

4001.94 --> 4007.4
but I did make trolls and tyrants

4004.64 --> 4011.1189999999997
but it's just Dungeons and Dragons game

4007.4 --> 4013.539
Rules book basically that's what it is

4011.119 --> 4017.539
I worked on it

4013.539 --> 4021.7990000000004
yeah an enormous amount of time

4017.539 --> 4024.619
and never made a scent of it

4021.799 --> 4027.2
so yeah can't blame people for telling

4024.619 --> 4029.839
me I wasted my time on that

4027.2 --> 4032.359
but I did learn a lot so here it is

4029.839 --> 4036.099
there's yeah the site

4032.359 --> 4036.0989999999997
he's not even complete really

4036.319 --> 4039.2799999999997
but uh

4039.799 --> 4044.859
yeah

4041.599 --> 4044.8590000000004
there should be

4045.2 --> 4049.52
under free downloads still some of the

4047.599 --> 4052.2200000000003
links should be working

4049.52 --> 4054.44
not all of them I still have it on my

4052.22 --> 4056.7799999999997
computer I just like the WordPress is

4054.44 --> 4060.38
like basically blackmailing me like you

4056.78 --> 4062.38
have to pay or you can basically edit it

4060.38 --> 4067.539
anymore

4062.38 --> 4067.539
I'm like no I'm not gonna do that

4067.579 --> 4071.5
I'll just keep the files on my computer

4083.0 --> 4087.68
foreign

4084.64 --> 4089.42
book that others use

4087.68 --> 4093.5589999999997
I don't know

4089.42 --> 4096.56
I I mean it's I've kind of advertised it

4093.559 --> 4099.5
a bit like under DND players and all

4096.56 --> 4102.46
that like hey you can do this if you can

4099.5 --> 4102.46
use this if you want

4102.799 --> 4109.58
it is adaptable to 3.5 system

4106.58 --> 4109.58
specifically

4111.08 --> 4116.9
right and that is like the biggest most

4115.04 --> 4121.339
widespread

4116.9 --> 4125.7789999999995
published version of DnD to date

4121.339 --> 4128.48
so and it is adaptable to all of that

4125.779 --> 4130.52
and I did some freaking research on it I

4128.48 --> 4132.62
basically collected like all books

4130.52 --> 4136.219
digitally

4132.62 --> 4138.5599999999995
just across reference

4136.219 --> 4142.04
everything

4138.56 --> 4145.64
so yeah I put basically a decade of

4142.04 --> 4148.759
dedicated work on that and arguably

4145.64 --> 4151.04
wasted all of my time doing that but I

4148.759 --> 4153.199
did learn a lot about it

4151.04 --> 4155.5
and I'm very satisfied with the end

4153.199 --> 4157.94
result which has overall been review

4155.5 --> 4161.6
revised by myself

4157.94 --> 4163.5199999999995
a minimum of 10 times sometimes up to 40

4161.6 --> 4166.04
times

4163.52 --> 4169.88
yeah that's how freaking meticulous I

4166.04 --> 4169.88
was with that [ __ ] hmm

4172.439 --> 4175.609
[Music]

4182.06 --> 4186.4400000000005
if you learn something and it's time not

4183.92 --> 4189.259
waste yeah I agreed but

4186.44 --> 4192.139999999999
it was still a lot of time

4189.259 --> 4195.92
I I basically spent

4192.14 --> 4195.92
started in 2007

4196.46 --> 4201.32
oh no 2006 already

4199.219 --> 4207.04
I just didn't think I was going to make

4201.32 --> 4211.88
a book then the 2006 up to

4207.04 --> 4215.48
2000 15. so yeah a decade

4211.88 --> 4218.02
I I to be fair I didn't really do much

4215.48 --> 4218.0199999999995
else

4219.02 --> 4225.7390000000005
besides like well media type research

4222.86 --> 4230.0199999999995
you know man did more research than I do

4225.739 --> 4230.0199999999995
now on average a lot more back then

4230.06 --> 4234.34
but that was kind of my pet project

4273.199 --> 4276.04
foreign

4278.96 --> 4285.219
also yesterday

4281.6 --> 4285.219
finally figured out that

4285.34 --> 4289.12
there's another way

4289.58 --> 4294.679
to listen to like one of my favorite

4292.159 --> 4298.879999999999
type musics

4294.679 --> 4302.42
which is from civilization five

4298.88 --> 4305.719
was hard kind of hard to find

4302.42 --> 4309.9800000000005
but it's basically the the Europe

4305.719 --> 4313.1
playlist and it is enormous I mean this

4309.98 --> 4316.94
game has unbelievable amounts of music

4313.1 --> 4320.3
and like unbelievable amounts I never

4316.94 --> 4322.178999999999
even realized it was that fast

4320.3 --> 4325.6990000000005
there's like

4322.179 --> 4328.4800000000005
400 songs in this game I never even knew

4325.699 --> 4328.48
it was that much

4329.42 --> 4335.54
and it's all classical all of it

4332.8 --> 4337.46
unbelievable a lot of it by the way is

4335.54 --> 4341.239
like kind of ripped

4337.46 --> 4344.54
from actual pieces that are older so

4341.239 --> 4346.699
there's real original classical music in

4344.54 --> 4348.739
there as well and some of it isn't some

4346.699 --> 4351.259999999999
of it is instrumental you can even like

4348.739 --> 4354.58
hear the recording noises people

4351.26 --> 4358.159000000001
coughing and others it's like

4354.58 --> 4360.739
digital it's like an emulation of

4358.159 --> 4363.08
classical instruments and you can only

4360.739 --> 4365.239
hear it like in the silent moments like

4363.08 --> 4366.199
that's not the way it sounds when you

4365.239 --> 4369.5
stop

4366.199 --> 4373.0599999999995
stop striking a uh a cello or something

4369.5 --> 4375.08
but while it's playing it is X

4373.06 --> 4377.320000000001
extraordinarily convincing that it's

4375.08 --> 4377.32
real

4378.08 --> 4382.36
yeah

4379.28 --> 4382.36
so here is it

4383.719 --> 4389.62
and seriously there are some songs in

4386.0 --> 4389.62
here that are just like

4390.44 --> 4394.879999999999
it's just

4392.06 --> 4397.280000000001
mind-boggling

4394.88 --> 4401.2390000000005
like dramatic

4397.28 --> 4403.699
deep music like really like it's just

4401.239 --> 4406.94
freaking amazing classical stuff I love

4403.699 --> 4410.839999999999
love some of these songs a lot some of

4406.94 --> 4413.9
these songs like really are almost scary

4410.84 --> 4417.32
because it's just so impactful it's so

4413.9 --> 4421.94
referencing to this sense of urgency and

4417.32 --> 4424.219
like how real and heavy it is and like

4421.94 --> 4427.219
the real

4424.219 --> 4429.08
Terror of War right when it's while

4427.219 --> 4431.719
you're playing a video game you get to

4429.08 --> 4433.82
hear music that really makes it like

4431.719 --> 4436.64
real even though it's a video game but

4433.82 --> 4438.679
it's it reminds you of how real it can

4436.64 --> 4439.9400000000005
be through the music sometimes and it's

4438.679 --> 4442.9
just

4439.94 --> 4442.9
amazing

4443.36 --> 4450.94
no virus today yes vaccines

4447.32 --> 4450.94
you're talking about a Kuma virus

4454.159 --> 4456.699
what

4468.14 --> 4472.159000000001
right but yeah some of the music in

4470.239 --> 4475.28
there like

4472.159 --> 4478.699
it also reminds me of there's like some

4475.28 --> 4478.699
pretty extraordinarily

4479.56 --> 4488.719
impactful For Me music and like Diablo 3

4483.82 --> 4491.139999999999
like creepy goth classical Style music

4488.719 --> 4495.14
but like

4491.14 --> 4498.08
yeah this is like G like Civilization

4495.14 --> 4502.179
it's less like composed classical music

4498.08 --> 4502.179
somebody actually make the effort

4506.06 --> 4511.400000000001
so it's different it's yeah

4508.58 --> 4513.92
I just I'm still hearing it in my head

4511.4 --> 4517.82
because there was before I was playing

4513.92 --> 4521.2390000000005
the game I just I just have to happen to

4517.82 --> 4524.599999999999
bump into that one song

4521.239 --> 4526.48
it would just have to play from the list

4524.6 --> 4529.820000000001
of

4526.48 --> 4533.0
76 different songs

4529.82 --> 4536.12
that are like two to four or sometimes

4533.0 --> 4539.6
six minutes it just happened to have to

4536.12 --> 4541.88
bump into that one song

4539.6 --> 4544.46
well now you could literally just look

4541.88 --> 4547.46
them up so it might almost ruin the

4544.46 --> 4551.3
experience of playing the game

4547.46 --> 4552.679
played that game just way way too many

4551.3 --> 4556.360000000001
times

4552.679 --> 4556.36
but I like it because of music

4558.32 --> 4563.08
it's off to work all right Godzilla

4560.3 --> 4563.08
thanks for popping by

4568.159 --> 4572.0
e there's a lot don't have to pay off

4569.78 --> 4574.5199999999995
equal to put the effort yeah I know

4572.0 --> 4579.1
metal slugs too well I did get some

4574.52 --> 4579.1
payoff because I used my system

4579.86 --> 4585.5
right I actually did play with it with

4583.1 --> 4587.42
two different d d groups one lasted very

4585.5 --> 4590.12
long

4587.42 --> 4593.2390000000005
I mean it it's basically yeah the

4590.12 --> 4595.699
players have just kind of discontinued

4593.239 --> 4598.639999999999
after Corona that ruined it all for me

4595.699 --> 4601.58
and that was it it is a tragedy still

4598.64 --> 4603.9800000000005
because we spent like

4601.58 --> 4608.199
six years playing that

4603.98 --> 4608.199
very regularly like

4608.719 --> 4614.14
every two weeks

4610.94 --> 4614.139999999999
for six years

4615.5 --> 4620.659
it was a big story

4617.659 --> 4622.5199999999995
with a lot of development

4620.659 --> 4625.759999999999
and I still got it written down by the

4622.52 --> 4626.900000000001
way like I have it on a file like I kept

4625.76 --> 4630.62
record

4626.9 --> 4633.62
every every episode we did I would make

4630.62 --> 4635.719
like a notification of what happened and

4633.62 --> 4638.96
I make a little story about it of like

4635.719 --> 4642.159
half to a full page

4638.96 --> 4646.52
and that's like happened what is it

4642.159 --> 4649.79
200 there's like over a hundred times so

4646.52 --> 4651.14
yeah I do have like perhaps

4649.79 --> 4655.88
[Music]

4651.14 --> 4657.860000000001
like maybe 200 pages of that story and I

4655.88 --> 4659.3
still kind of wanted to actually make it

4657.86 --> 4661.94
in a book

4659.3 --> 4665.0
but yeah that's now very hard since I

4661.94 --> 4667.219
wasn't able to actually finish

4665.0 --> 4670.1
the main story

4667.219 --> 4673.76
they got to like half of it and then

4670.1 --> 4676.64
like it's just like I can't seem to

4673.76 --> 4678.4400000000005
like I can't draw in new players and

4676.64 --> 4680.96
just continue this it's not gonna work

4678.44 --> 4683.299999999999
like they are the characters they made

4680.96 --> 4686.14
it and they really invested

4683.3 --> 4686.14
in them

4686.42 --> 4690.4400000000005
it's not gonna work if it's just gonna

4688.64 --> 4691.9400000000005
be other players they are just gonna be

4690.44 --> 4694.4
like

4691.94 --> 4697.94
more yeah robotic they're not gonna get

4694.4 --> 4700.699
it they're not gonna get subtleties

4697.94 --> 4704.08
ah

4700.699 --> 4704.08
nothing I can do about it

4704.96 --> 4710.44
but I did actually use my DND book

4709.159 --> 4712.759999999999
foreign

4710.44 --> 4716.0
and it was interesting

4712.76 --> 4719.179
and it revealed very easily also like

4716.0 --> 4721.4
how universally overpowered

4719.179 --> 4723.9800000000005
characters can become

4721.4 --> 4726.5
and I tried to balance it out and it was

4723.98 --> 4729.32
still overpowered there's like inherent

4726.5 --> 4732.26
problems to D and D

4729.32 --> 4735.86
that basically even a more refined

4732.26 --> 4738.76
redesign could not overcome

4735.86 --> 4742.78
which is probably the reason why they

4738.76 --> 4742.780000000001
moved on to another version

4743.36 --> 4745.9
foreign

4747.159 --> 4751.159
games what

4754.04 --> 4757.12
what are those

4778.159 --> 4781.12
foreign

4793.04 --> 4796.04
strategy

4796.76 --> 4799.360000000001
okay

4805.28 --> 4810.759999999999
is that like an older type game I don't

4808.1 --> 4810.76
remember it

4813.199 --> 4815.919999999999
foreign

4823.5 --> 4832.529
[Music]

4835.98 --> 4839.15
[Music]

4845.42 --> 4848.02
okay

4849.34 --> 4854.06
crusader

4851.239 --> 4856.48
stronghold 2 that is that what you're

4854.06 --> 4856.4800000000005
talking about

4858.679 --> 4862.0
never heard of this

4862.219 --> 4866.26
Firefly Studios hmm

4885.26 --> 4891.1
and Castle sin

4888.26 --> 4891.1
hmm

4908.239 --> 4914.0599999999995
that looks pretty interesting really

4910.6 --> 4916.900000000001
derped it to it

4914.06 --> 4916.900000000001
what

4939.35 --> 4942.52
[Music]

4953.78 --> 4955.78
um

4974.06 --> 4978.159000000001
that looks kind of interesting really

4978.38 --> 4983.12
maybe I'm gonna download that

4988.25 --> 4991.59
[Music]

4994.52 --> 4999.38
when the horse is at your left your

4997.1 --> 5001.9800000000005
right

4999.38 --> 5001.9800000000005
what

5016.61 --> 5019.7699999999995
[Music]

5021.699 --> 5028.54
all right so metal slugs cockatiel with

5024.76 --> 5032.34
at the start of the week all right yeah

5028.54 --> 5032.34
hello then white by the way

5034.0 --> 5040.96
first two were okay thanks I wanted to

5037.0 --> 5045.0
ask like which ones are like the best

5040.96 --> 5045.0
all right so it's the first two cool

5045.1 --> 5048.120000000001
I'll check it out

5056.199 --> 5062.259999999999
I'm I'm specifically interested by the

5059.44 --> 5065.5
way in music I mean

5062.26 --> 5067.0
I judge games

5065.5 --> 5069.4
like

5067.0 --> 5071.98
the majority of it

5069.4 --> 5075.219
it matters more whether the music is

5071.98 --> 5078.638999999999
good than even if the game is good yeah

5075.219 --> 5082.4800000000005
although yeah it has to be good but like

5078.639 --> 5083.8
if the music is like really good and the

5082.48 --> 5086.919999999999
game is like

5083.8 --> 5090.159000000001
difficult to master then it's absolutely

5086.92 --> 5092.7390000000005
fine now if it's shitty music however

5090.159 --> 5095.379999999999
and it's difficult to master it's a

5092.739 --> 5097.299999999999
great likelihood I'm gonna walk away

5095.38 --> 5099.6990000000005
because it sucks

5097.3 --> 5103.320000000001
to do something difficult when the music

5099.699 --> 5103.32
sucks this is

5110.58 --> 5115.36
they're too difficult to figure

5112.96 --> 5117.88
something out basically when the music

5115.36 --> 5121.92
sucks that's really sucky you're dated

5117.88 --> 5121.92
today's date look

5122.98 --> 5125.4
okay

5129.94 --> 5133.96
all right

5131.199 --> 5136.379999999999
or what went wrong then with the newer

5133.96 --> 5136.38
versions

5137.5 --> 5143.62
like did they

5140.139 --> 5145.900000000001
just take away like the most amazing

5143.62 --> 5148.739
Parts about it and just try to turn it

5145.9 --> 5148.739
into something else

5148.84 --> 5151.5
no

5151.54 --> 5154.54
boo

5190.239 --> 5193.659
all right anyway I'll check it out we'll

5192.46 --> 5195.94
see

5193.659 --> 5197.379999999999
right but let's move on because I just

5195.94 --> 5200.739
don't wanna

5197.38 --> 5203.26
talk half the show about video games

5200.739 --> 5205.62
you don't mind it's not what this show

5203.26 --> 5205.62
is about

5205.9 --> 5213.4
oh it is relevant sometimes uh

5210.699 --> 5217.419999999999
anyway it was pretty cool

5213.4 --> 5221.879999999999
reviewing Six Star Wars to Road deck

5217.42 --> 5221.88
and like yeah using it

5274.42 --> 5278.5
right so

5276.46 --> 5280.9
maybe we could talk about Flat Earth

5278.5 --> 5285.36
Zone right

5280.9 --> 5285.36
or something in that direction

5290.62 --> 5296.199
or I could just round out the show early

5293.199 --> 5298.678999999999
if everybody's just leaving

5296.199 --> 5298.678999999999
right

5307.9 --> 5310.9
ah

5338.98 --> 5341.159
foreign

5367.9 --> 5370.739
you know which

5375.4 --> 5380.199
this

5376.96 --> 5382.54
is the printed out version

5380.199 --> 5385.739
of my book

5382.54 --> 5385.739
and yeah

5385.78 --> 5389.28
that's thick

5390.52 --> 5396.2390000000005
but this is like an earlier version so

5392.8 --> 5396.2390000000005
this is completely outdated

5396.34 --> 5399.2390000000005
but uh

5400.36 --> 5405.659
foreign

5402.28 --> 5405.659
just look at this

5406.84 --> 5410.38
giant list

5408.699 --> 5414.28
like

5410.38 --> 5416.92
different weapon types

5414.28 --> 5420.0
this is just a list of weapon types this

5416.92 --> 5420.0
all of it

5420.659 --> 5426.82
has nobody ever made that in DND right I

5424.78 --> 5429.099999999999
didn't never understood why they didn't

5426.82 --> 5433.0199999999995
have just like a complete catalog of all

5429.1 --> 5433.02
weapons that could ever exist

5434.66 --> 5437.7789999999995
[Music]

5442.54 --> 5450.4
I loved making every part of this

5447.1 --> 5453.46
yeah this like this is

5450.4 --> 5455.739
a material type catalog this is

5453.46 --> 5457.659
basically like a physics book

5455.739 --> 5459.339999999999
for D and D

5457.659 --> 5461.5
ude

5459.34 --> 5464.32
like all the materials what you can make

5461.5 --> 5468.0
of them how that works what like the

5464.32 --> 5470.739
attributes are all material types

5468.0 --> 5474.52
adamantine alchemical silver coal iron

5470.739 --> 5477.339999999999
mithril steel crystal diamond Granite

5474.52 --> 5480.52
obsidian Sandstone dragon scales fish

5477.34 --> 5483.6990000000005
scales reptilian skills demon skin fur

5480.52 --> 5487.6
height leather dark wood hardwood wood

5483.699 --> 5490.44
bone carapass feathers teeth

5487.6 --> 5490.4400000000005
there you go

5492.88 --> 5496.92
that's what I spent freaking nine years

5495.639 --> 5499.659000000001
on

5496.92 --> 5501.6
perfecting all of that

5499.659 --> 5505.48
spells

5501.6 --> 5508.26
Jesus Christ so many spells

5505.48 --> 5508.259999999999
I mean

5511.239 --> 5519.48
let me this is an old version yeah

5515.86 --> 5519.48
got way more now

5522.94 --> 5530.0199999999995
this is all just description of spells

5526.44 --> 5532.299999999999
revisitations like yeah it was kind of

5530.02 --> 5534.280000000001
undefined back then

5532.3 --> 5537.219
so I thought like yeah let's be

5534.28 --> 5538.78
extremely specific and dynamic

5537.219 --> 5542.32
so that

5538.78 --> 5544.719
it you the game master knows exactly

5542.32 --> 5546.34
what they have with it and where they

5544.719 --> 5548.52
should apply it

5546.34 --> 5551.92
because there's less

5548.52 --> 5554.38
randomized open factors that are like oh

5551.92 --> 5556.659
but yeah then the game The Gamers can

5554.38 --> 5558.28
just start to say you start the lawyer

5556.659 --> 5559.12
speak their way through and say but yeah

5558.28 --> 5561.34
but

5559.12 --> 5564.34
but it said doesn't say that

5561.34 --> 5566.4400000000005
specifically so it could interpret it

5564.34 --> 5568.659000000001
that it actually is like this and then

5566.44 --> 5570.58
if the game master is like hmm okay well

5568.659 --> 5573.099999999999
I feel generous yeah it works like that

5570.58 --> 5574.6
and then half the game becomes screwed

5573.1 --> 5578.88
up because then they're stuck to that

5574.6 --> 5582.76
decision well no more everything is

5578.88 --> 5587.32
hyper specifically Divine now everything

5582.76 --> 5589.719
about it yeah I basically rewrote one of

5587.32 --> 5593.219
the biggest freaking Game books

5589.719 --> 5593.219
in human history

5594.58 --> 5602.82
and this is all compatible all of it

5598.48 --> 5602.82
all of it is compatible with everything

5607.12 --> 5614.44
even to kind of more Niche systems

5610.3 --> 5618.4800000000005
that are also grafted onto DnD 3.5 even

5614.44 --> 5618.48
though it's full compatible

5619.48 --> 5624.04
and yeah hey if nobody wants to use it

5622.12 --> 5626.86
then it's your [ __ ] problem then

5624.04 --> 5630.9
because it's free it's free you can have

5626.86 --> 5630.9
it is it open license

5631.3 --> 5637.179
everybody can use this for free you

5635.08 --> 5639.5199999999995
don't have to pay me a cent you never

5637.179 --> 5642.4
will have to pay me a cent now of course

5639.52 --> 5643.719
you can donate to my PayPal but you

5642.4 --> 5646.679
don't have to

5643.719 --> 5646.679
not for this

5648.76 --> 5651.2390000000005
all right

5652.9 --> 5655.0199999999995
yeah

5655.26 --> 5658.84
polymorph wild-shaped creatures known

5657.76 --> 5660.88
sheet

5658.84 --> 5663.219
literally the sheet of like different

5660.88 --> 5665.679
animals that you can turn into with

5663.219 --> 5667.659
polymorph or wild chickens like a druid

5665.679 --> 5669.9400000000005
ability

5667.659 --> 5672.28
because I made that a rule you can't

5669.94 --> 5674.86
just form into whatever the [ __ ] you

5672.28 --> 5676.0
want you will actually have to know the

5674.86 --> 5678.219
creature

5676.0 --> 5681.82
and you have to study it

5678.219 --> 5685.08
that's in the supplemental rules

5681.82 --> 5685.08
in this part

5685.659 --> 5691.739
yeah

5687.94 --> 5691.739
I impact changes

5692.139 --> 5699.400000000001
optional changes

5695.38 --> 5703.4800000000005
detail changes like yeah like how

5699.4 --> 5705.46
these are like lawyer things

5703.48 --> 5708.159
because all of this applies to

5705.46 --> 5712.2390000000005
everything

5708.159 --> 5715.36
every every DNA game it's fully Dynamic

5712.239 --> 5718.799999999999
here a skill description

5715.36 --> 5721.719
I'm the first one ever to actually

5718.8 --> 5723.9400000000005
revise that thing that hasn't even

5721.719 --> 5728.38
changed since 3.0

5723.94 --> 5733.36
oh you know how big it is now

5728.38 --> 5736.2390000000005
it's over eight times as many pages and

5733.36 --> 5740.38
everything about it is like

5736.239 --> 5743.08
now you know what the ability is from a

5740.38 --> 5746.02
starter to a god

5743.08 --> 5748.179
and like it gives even suggestions like

5746.02 --> 5750.820000000001
surreal things that you could end up

5748.179 --> 5754.179
doing never really in the real world but

5750.82 --> 5756.5199999999995
if your ability was just surreal what

5754.179 --> 5759.04
could you actually still do with it yeah

5756.52 --> 5761.320000000001
the freaking the Wizards of the Coast

5759.04 --> 5763.179
guys didn't even think about that they

5761.32 --> 5765.46
didn't even have options of

5763.179 --> 5767.8
extraordinary things you could end up

5765.46 --> 5769.6
doing with your skill ability they just

5767.8 --> 5773.26
didn't have it

5769.6 --> 5775.719
well I made it and it's

5773.26 --> 5777.159000000001
this thick

5775.719 --> 5779.56
okay

5777.159 --> 5781.679
like in the original d d book I'll show

5779.56 --> 5781.679
you

5788.26 --> 5793.719
yeah

5790.84 --> 5797.08
all right yeah it's a 3.0 boom

5793.719 --> 5801.46
but it's sadly the same anyway

5797.08 --> 5801.46
show you the skills here

5801.88 --> 5805.56
as soon as I find them

5817.39 --> 5820.549
[Music]

5835.48 --> 5838.48
descriptions

5840.219 --> 5842.82
and

5844.659 --> 5852.299999999999
freaking feats

5847.619 --> 5852.299999999999
ah wait yeah there you go

5852.52 --> 5858.219
skills let me show you the skills in the

5856.239 --> 5859.959999999999
original book

5858.219 --> 5862.78
and this is

5859.96 --> 5864.78
like even with pictures and [ __ ]

5862.78 --> 5868.179
yeah

5864.78 --> 5870.94
this is how many pages

5868.179 --> 5874.6
the original skill descriptions are you

5870.94 --> 5877.5
understand that's how many

5874.6 --> 5877.5
that's

5878.619 --> 5884.5
13 Pages including pictures

5882.53 --> 5887.639
[Music]

5884.5 --> 5887.639
let's compare that

5888.04 --> 5893.34
oh oh I I got it notified compare that

5891.4 --> 5899.259999999999
to my

5893.34 --> 5902.5
54 pages of skill description 54.

5899.26 --> 5903.76
compared to 13.

5902.5 --> 5906.94
yeah

5903.76 --> 5910.4400000000005
without pictures

5906.94 --> 5914.86
it's a little bit more elaborate

5910.44 --> 5918.5199999999995
just enormous amounts of diagrams

5914.86 --> 5921.04
like the survival skill alone is just it

5918.52 --> 5922.4800000000005
was completely undeveloped now it just

5921.04 --> 5924.639
like

5922.48 --> 5927.28
well yeah you know how freaking

5924.639 --> 5932.56
elaborate survival skills can be right

5927.28 --> 5935.08
guys well now they are now you can

5932.56 --> 5937.139
actually like do a lot of different

5935.08 --> 5938.8
things with that

5937.139 --> 5940.2390000000005
including

5938.8 --> 5943.42
like

5940.239 --> 5945.0599999999995
turning in a hunted animal into food

5943.42 --> 5947.7390000000005
skinning them

5945.06 --> 5949.659000000001
processing that

5947.739 --> 5951.099999999999
in a basic version because if you

5949.659 --> 5952.9
actually want to make a letter then you

5951.1 --> 5955.06
have to have leather craft

5952.9 --> 5958.239
which is a separate skill

5955.06 --> 5962.02
right but even like

5958.239 --> 5964.9
yeah things like use rope which was like

5962.02 --> 5969.179
the most neglected skill ever I just

5964.9 --> 5969.179
made a system for it

5970.6 --> 5975.400000000001
the way it actually starts to make sense

5972.76 --> 5979.3
and if you want you can be like a rogue

5975.4 --> 5981.78
master that can like make machines with

5979.3 --> 5981.78
ropes

5983.92 --> 5990.6900000000005
anyway just wanted to show that

5987.94 --> 5995.0199999999995
what I really wanted to show

5990.69 --> 5997.839999999999
[Music]

5995.02 --> 6000.719
some nice old Maps

5997.84 --> 6003.92
isn't that awesome see this is what I

6000.719 --> 6003.92
was doing with my time

6004.619 --> 6010.98
most of my life

6006.84 --> 6014.9400000000005
creating places with histories

6010.98 --> 6017.4
and this is one of those places

6014.94 --> 6020.239
oh and this one has an actual full

6017.4 --> 6020.239
background history

6024.06 --> 6029.1
Windstream

6026.46 --> 6031.52
yeah these are the wind streams in that

6029.1 --> 6031.52
Realm

6039.659 --> 6046.638999999999
oh and here's a basic design for a

6043.92 --> 6046.639
wizard tower

6046.98 --> 6051.259999999999
foreign

6048.21 --> 6051.26
[Music]

6067.37 --> 6070.5289999999995
[Music]

6073.44 --> 6079.678999999999
memories every part of this

6076.92 --> 6083.659
The Gamers have played in

6079.679 --> 6083.659
this is [ __ ] this is a decade

6084.48 --> 6088.5
this alone

6087.0 --> 6093.26
oh [ __ ]

6088.5 --> 6093.26
ain't much work into that so much work

6098.82 --> 6106.38
just like yeah this is a

6102.179 --> 6107.76
like a castle in the mountains area that

6106.38 --> 6110.400000000001
is like a

6107.76 --> 6113.58
sort of a diplomatic Safe Haven thing

6110.4 --> 6118.138999999999
they never got to it damn it

6113.58 --> 6119.88
I had all these characters and yeah

6118.139 --> 6121.86
but yeah the funny thing is you can

6119.88 --> 6124.6990000000005
always type this type of thing you can

6121.86 --> 6124.699
recycle it

6124.739 --> 6131.638999999999
these are just pages of History

6128.84 --> 6133.92
of that City

6131.639 --> 6136.34
one city in that game this is all

6133.92 --> 6136.34
history

6136.619 --> 6142.46
the most elaborate history work I've

6138.96 --> 6142.46
ever done in being vegan

6151.139 --> 6155.6
but this is not even the one I wanted to

6153.3 --> 6155.6
show you

6156.96 --> 6160.34
must be this one

6163.92 --> 6167.76
yes it is

6165.659 --> 6170.5199999999995
yeah this is the one I was actually

6167.76 --> 6173.58
gonna publish this I was actually gonna

6170.52 --> 6176.76
publish this into a book an official

6173.58 --> 6178.739
book I made many drawings for it

6176.76 --> 6180.6
so I made all this environmental

6178.739 --> 6181.379999999999
drawings were like this is when you

6180.6 --> 6184.860000000001
enter

6181.38 --> 6187.32
just like a a metal

6184.86 --> 6190.38
sort of little Fortress that's suspended

6187.32 --> 6193.5
over a volcano

6190.38 --> 6195.119
in in like in a cave complex and they

6193.5 --> 6199.1
use this

6195.119 --> 6199.099999999999
for adamantine foraging

6202.08 --> 6208.46
right and in this game it's been taken

6204.659 --> 6208.46
by goblins and you got to take it back

6218.219 --> 6220.4
foreign

6220.58 --> 6223.71
[Music]

6224.719 --> 6231.9
these are all like places you bump into

6229.679 --> 6234.119
as you go this is like a full

6231.9 --> 6236.4
Subterranean Adventure so it's like it

6234.119 --> 6238.5599999999995
starts out with dwarfs they want goblins

6236.4 --> 6240.339999999999
to be overtaken but you can go much

6238.56 --> 6241.7390000000005
further into

6240.34 --> 6244.860000000001
[Music]

6241.739 --> 6249.619
in in there

6244.86 --> 6249.619
bump into all kinds of situations

6250.5 --> 6256.02
and so this is like a compatible word

6252.89 --> 6256.02
[Music]

6259.5 --> 6264.78
somebody can literally grab this into

6262.8 --> 6268.08
their Adventure it's just like oh you

6264.78 --> 6269.58
want this mountain to have content

6268.08 --> 6273.92
oh

6269.58 --> 6273.92
there you go and there's the actual

6274.94 --> 6279.98
autographic View

6276.84 --> 6279.9800000000005
of the complex

6283.619 --> 6286.82
top-down layout

6291.1 --> 6294.249000000001
[Music]

6294.54 --> 6297.38
rest of it

6300.42 --> 6304.26
bridge bridge section

6305.639 --> 6311.58
and even the chains because yeah the

6308.82 --> 6313.139
players can choose to try to crawl up

6311.58 --> 6316.5599999999995
the chains

6313.139 --> 6319.08
and avoid getting seed some of them may

6316.56 --> 6321.679
have invisibility abilities

6319.08 --> 6321.679
uh

6322.08 --> 6325.44
and this is an entire blueprint like

6324.54 --> 6328.26
this

6325.44 --> 6331.86
is literally this could literally be

6328.26 --> 6335.219
grafted into video game setup like this

6331.86 --> 6338.0599999999995
is a full rollout table or what can

6335.219 --> 6338.06
happen in there

6338.52 --> 6343.219
and I got it with all of these

6351.78 --> 6354.38
right

6363.54 --> 6371.159
this is what people do that have no life

6366.37 --> 6375.3
[Music]

6371.159 --> 6379.5199999999995
I spent pretty much all my time on this

6375.3 --> 6379.52
well this is before flatter so

6382.31 --> 6388.9400000000005
[Music]

6385.1 --> 6388.9400000000005
great Morgan Hall

6428.52 --> 6434.639
if I end up get going to any kind of a

6432.179 --> 6437.4
heaven or something this is probably

6434.639 --> 6439.8
what I'll be doing in the heaven is

6437.4 --> 6441.42
playing DND

6439.8 --> 6445.58
because

6441.42 --> 6445.58
There's No Limit not really

6452.34 --> 6460.04
you heard through the grip Frank

6455.88 --> 6460.04
I'm a good writer from who

6467.76 --> 6472.26

6470.159 --> 6475.5
indeed

6472.26 --> 6479.1
40 years something very real oh and yeah

6475.5 --> 6481.739
and I learned to become a game master

6479.1 --> 6483.900000000001
and an Entertainer and

6481.739 --> 6485.459999999999
psychology

6483.9 --> 6488.159
yeah

6485.46 --> 6490.76
a lot of it Layman

6488.159 --> 6490.759999999999
Medical

6494.76 --> 6504.5
I basically have a view for the world

6499.08 --> 6509.46
build up over the ages over the decades

6504.5 --> 6513.619
so I have a show I have people that know

6509.46 --> 6513.619
me that support me even financially

6514.139 --> 6519.6
friends I used to have friends they're

6516.96 --> 6522.42
all Ballers and

6519.6 --> 6524.820000000001
and yeah

6522.42 --> 6526.56
like I'm not gonna deal with them

6524.82 --> 6530.719
anymore

6526.56 --> 6530.719
so yeah I left my friends

6532.8 --> 6541.400000000001
career well this is currently my career

6537.06 --> 6541.400000000001
anything yeah all of this

6546.3 --> 6553.219
wow

6548.28 --> 6553.219
what have you been doing in your life

6553.32 --> 6558.299999999999
Emma Stone I mean your faculties are

6555.78 --> 6561.679
incredible that you have to ask what's

6558.3 --> 6561.679
seeking star water means

6590.4 --> 6597.86
uh hey Julio Babin

6594.239 --> 6597.86
it's good to see you around again

6599.82 --> 6603.0199999999995
hope you're doing well

6613.8 --> 6620.599
played somebody in gem Panda server said

6617.58 --> 6624.179
I was a good writer

6620.599 --> 6627.179
well I did kind of like even years back

6624.179 --> 6632.099
I showed some of my DND stuff and yeah

6627.179 --> 6635.099
it's like I claim that I mean I've spent

6632.099 --> 6638.04
thousands of hours on that and yeah if I

6635.099 --> 6640.619000000001
get to refine stuff I'm gonna make it

6638.04 --> 6643.38
really freaking good

6640.619 --> 6646.86
and yeah whether it's gonna make me

6643.38 --> 6648.659000000001
money or something it's just I don't

6646.86 --> 6650.699
have any more concern for that after

6648.659 --> 6652.44
that point once I dedicate something

6650.699 --> 6654.9
like this is going to be the best

6652.44 --> 6658.619
imaginable then

6654.9 --> 6662.179
is soon followed by [ __ ] money I'm just

6658.619 --> 6662.179
gonna make it as best as I can

6664.79 --> 6670.109
[Music]

6671.52 --> 6677.219
so I have shared like the trolls and

6673.739 --> 6680.28
Tyrant site and all that before

6677.219 --> 6682.56
why not sell the book instead of begging

6680.28 --> 6685.5599999999995
well

6682.56 --> 6688.9800000000005
it's an open license

6685.56 --> 6692.360000000001
but once it's open like you can't un

6688.98 --> 6692.36
open license it

6696.119 --> 6699.44
it is what it is

6702.719 --> 6708.56
English yeah definitely English

6705.96 --> 6708.56
dude

6709.37 --> 6714.84
[Music]

6710.76 --> 6718.88
why the hell would I do that in Dutch

6714.84 --> 6718.88
ridiculous it's all English

6731.219 --> 6734.46
all right but hey check it out for

6733.139 --> 6736.619
yourself

6734.46 --> 6739.52
I'm gonna run at the show by the way

6736.619 --> 6739.5199999999995
time has flown

6756.659 --> 6760.159
I've got some writing

6762.599 --> 6767.34
basically ah yeah unfortunately like the

6765.84 --> 6770.900000000001
base classes aren't in there that's

6767.34 --> 6770.900000000001
probably the most important book

6771.96 --> 6776.88
I think you could still get yeah you

6774.0 --> 6779.699
could still get some out of the Prestige

6776.88 --> 6781.9800000000005
classes which are like well Prestige

6779.699 --> 6783.598999999999
glasses but every Prestige class also

6781.98 --> 6786.839999999999
has

6783.599 --> 6789.42
a a basic

6786.84 --> 6794.28
like over generalized intro it's like

6789.42 --> 6797.219
yeah this is what they're likely like

6794.28 --> 6799.5599999999995
to give it a bit of form or yeah or at

6797.219 --> 6802.7390000000005
least my interpretation you know because

6799.56 --> 6806.34
if somebody's like no no mine is

6802.739 --> 6808.799999999999
completely the opposite of all that

6806.34 --> 6811.400000000001
because I'm a special boy game master

6808.8 --> 6814.5
and I think I'd know everything better

6811.4 --> 6816.598999999999
than the entire world including morality

6814.5 --> 6818.88
which I do believe in or that kind of

6816.599 --> 6821.34
crap yeah there are game Masters like

6818.88 --> 6823.02
that really annoying

6821.34 --> 6825.360000000001
uh

6823.02 --> 6827.6990000000005
so yeah they might not agree with the

6825.36 --> 6830.5199999999995
way that I've described certain things

6827.699 --> 6832.138999999999
but they'll definitely agree that the

6830.52 --> 6834.96
way

6832.139 --> 6837.8
like the classes have now been developed

6834.96 --> 6841.139
and balanced out works

6837.8 --> 6845.099
much much better

6841.139 --> 6848.219
than all the previous versions

6845.099 --> 6850.7390000000005
of these Prestige classes

6848.219 --> 6853.619
and I also entered in a couple of new

6850.739 --> 6856.138999999999
ones but it's mostly Revisited

6853.619 --> 6857.88
it's like all those really cool Prestige

6856.139 --> 6860.639
classes that were like very promising

6857.88 --> 6862.86
and then they just sucked it's like yeah

6860.639 --> 6864.96
that's awesome thing to do oh here's

6862.86 --> 6868.38
here's the here's the little

6864.96 --> 6870.96
[ __ ] do oh yeah they suck yeah that's

6868.38 --> 6872.34
lame it's a really cool idea and then

6870.96 --> 6875.04
when you want to play that really cool

6872.34 --> 6877.38
idea it just sucks yeah that's what you

6875.04 --> 6879.86
don't want so I made really cool things

6877.38 --> 6879.86
out of them

6885.239 --> 6887.839999999999
