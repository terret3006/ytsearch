193.84 --> 198.20000000000002
good to see you gadget inspector

198.48 --> 201.92
yeah what happened yesterday yeah i

200.0 --> 204.64
didn't have a show yesterday

201.92 --> 206.48
now if you follow my twitter

204.64 --> 209.11999999999998
you would have figured that out because

206.48 --> 211.04
yeah i'm still using my twitter and hey

209.12 --> 213.92000000000002
it's a good place

211.04 --> 216.64
if i don't show up i'm gonna tweet

213.92 --> 218.879
that i'm not showing up

216.64 --> 218.879
right

219.2 --> 222.64
so

220.56 --> 225.28
that normally you'd be looking back at

222.64 --> 227.44
like the last show it's comment section

225.28 --> 228.159
right but they're turned off now well

227.44 --> 230.72
now

228.159 --> 232.879
you can look on twitter

230.72 --> 233.92
and then you can see like hey what

232.879 --> 236.72
happened

233.92 --> 239.83999999999997
like even if i like

236.72 --> 242.08
if i'm super late or like

239.84 --> 243.92000000000002
was in some situation and it wasn't

242.08 --> 246.64000000000001
there all afternoon

243.92 --> 248.879
then i'll still like show up later and

246.64 --> 251.67999999999998
say like oh yeah i didn't show up today

248.879 --> 254.56
don't worry i'll be back tomorrow

251.68 --> 256.799
so that's one way to keep track

254.56 --> 260.479
right hey i'm doing twitter now so might

256.799 --> 260.479
as well use it right

263.12 --> 266.4
but yeah yesterday i

265.12 --> 268.56
i

266.4 --> 271.28
chose to skip the show because i

268.56 --> 273.44
overslept a lot i literally i don't even

271.28 --> 276.32
understand really why

273.44 --> 277.52
i just slept extremely long

276.32 --> 279.12
and then

277.52 --> 281.03999999999996
slept

279.12 --> 282.96
like quickly turned off

281.04 --> 286.72
you know the alarm clock and was like oh

282.96 --> 288.88
no i just need to lay a little more

286.72 --> 290.40000000000003
just a little more and then i woke up 15

288.88 --> 291.52
minutes before i would normally start

290.4 --> 294.4
the show

291.52 --> 297.44
and yeah looking all sleepy and all that

294.4 --> 300.56
[ __ ] so

297.44 --> 303.039
i thought okay i'll just start very late

300.56 --> 306.56
but then

303.039 --> 308.84
yeah it it all i became an hour late and

306.56 --> 312.72
then i thought like nah

308.84 --> 315.52
i i'm just going to skip this one

312.72 --> 318.0
and join fed after pre-show and that's

315.52 --> 318.0
what i did

320.96 --> 327.28
low terror306 good to see you

324.88 --> 328.96
right so yeah the house is really quiet

327.28 --> 332.0
right now because

328.96 --> 334.79999999999995
i think everybody's on vacation now

332.0 --> 334.8
except maybe

335.12 --> 340.56
the cute roommate

338.56 --> 342.479
but she still comes back every now and

340.56 --> 344.56
then to like check up on her room but

342.479 --> 348.56
she's like staying over their parents

344.56 --> 348.56
the other two roommates are off the

349.28 --> 352.28
france

352.479 --> 357.36
and

354.32 --> 357.36
see the guy going

357.52 --> 360.56
switzerland i think

359.199 --> 362.56
yeah

360.56 --> 364.96
so

362.56 --> 366.88
i'm literally having my door right open

364.96 --> 369.75899999999996
right now because it's like i got all

366.88 --> 372.479
the house to myself so i could even yell

369.759 --> 374.47900000000004
and nobody here would be

372.479 --> 376.24
noticing that

374.479 --> 377.919
but it's really nice to have the door

376.24 --> 380.24
open during a live show because that

377.919 --> 383.19899999999996
means i'm gonna have like this fresh air

380.24 --> 386.40000000000003
site circulation going here

383.199 --> 386.40000000000003
which is very pleasant

390.4 --> 393.4
what

394.0 --> 398.72
so i already get accept

396.88 --> 401.039
why did you i don't know yeah i did see

398.72 --> 402.96000000000004

434.96 --> 443.52
[Music]

48 hours yeah that's quick

443.52 --> 446.84

474.8 --> 478.96000000000004
you're like getting worried or something

477.12 --> 480.08
like if i was an hour late i would be

478.96 --> 483.12
worried

480.08 --> 485.28
but you can always check twitter

483.12 --> 487.039
right even if i like

485.28 --> 490.15999999999997
don't show up well there's no other way

487.039 --> 492.31899999999996
to say it other than like through fed

490.16 --> 494.16
live

492.319 --> 497.91900000000004
you can see me there but if i don't show

494.16 --> 500.56
up i'll make a note on twitter so just

497.919 --> 500.56
check that out

502.4 --> 506.4
uh

503.599 --> 509.28
okay gadget inspector

506.4 --> 509.28
take it easy there

514.24 --> 518.399
you might want to keep yourself on mute

516.0 --> 518.399
today

518.959 --> 523.76
i don't want any weird

521.36 --> 523.76
drunk

523.839 --> 529.0400000000001
behavior in here

525.76 --> 529.04
it's very early man

529.279 --> 532.279
anyway

534.16 --> 539.04
right so yeah that yesterday's flat

536.0 --> 539.04
earth debate was great

539.519 --> 546.6
it's very long

541.76 --> 546.6
again it was like a four hour show

550.0 --> 555.839
i think puma got on there for a bit

554.08 --> 556.64
i don't know eventually i kind of like

555.839 --> 560.9590000000001
lost

556.64 --> 562.72
track and like my attention just

560.959 --> 565.1199999999999
because the guys were just staying very

562.72 --> 566.399
technical very long and

565.12 --> 569.2
you know when

566.399 --> 571.44
nathan's going at a baller

569.2 --> 573.76
there is very little wiggling room in

571.44 --> 575.6
between i did manage to drop a few

573.76 --> 576.8
remarks

575.6 --> 579.44
in

576.8 --> 579.4399999999999
but yeah

589.36 --> 593.36
okay gadget inspector that's really nice

591.6 --> 596.399
that you think it's all normal and all

593.36 --> 598.64
that but this is a workshop

596.399 --> 600.88
i would typically do not appreciate it

598.64 --> 603.04
if people show up drunk even if they

600.88 --> 605.279
think it's all justified right because

603.04 --> 606.399
this is a workshop

605.279 --> 610.279
but

606.399 --> 610.279
we'll see how that goes

622.0 --> 625.0
right

641.279 --> 647.4399999999999
what's that overall doing besides fed

645.519 --> 649.04
a couple of videos here and there but

647.44 --> 652.24
nothing like

649.04 --> 652.24
super impressed about

652.64 --> 657.64
a gym bob did like an interesting video

663.12 --> 665.92
that was weird

669.04 --> 672.959
oh wait no yeah yeah he had a video

671.839 --> 675.839
earlier

672.959 --> 677.3599999999999
but he just had an entire show yesterday

675.839 --> 679.6800000000001
and that was fun sitting in there and

677.36 --> 679.6800000000001
chat

682.88 --> 687.8389999999999
yeah there was this crazy indian

687.2 --> 690.8000000000001

really

698.079 --> 703.5999999999999
really bad

700.079 --> 705.76
did you see that and jim bob like

703.6 --> 707.9200000000001
handled him perfectly because this guy

705.76 --> 711.6
was basically

707.92 --> 711.5999999999999
more psycho than brenda

712.079 --> 717.8389999999999

714.16 --> 717.8389999999999
yesterday's jim bob show

718.079 --> 724.4799999999999
trying to find a moment where he got on

721.36 --> 724.48
was very long

728.16 --> 734.079
right yeah because

731.519 --> 737.279
it started out with a little video of

734.079 --> 737.279
like painting

738.72 --> 744.399
the telescope picture that was it the

741.36 --> 748.32
harare whatever it is

744.399 --> 751.92
i always mix up the names

748.32 --> 755.9200000000001
but yeah then he reviewed a comment from

751.92 --> 755.92
this guy and they just had a show for

757.2 --> 760.24
for like an hour

760.8 --> 764.639
and then

762.079 --> 769.079
gymbot had other guests on but yeah do

764.639 --> 769.0790000000001

802.24 --> 805.76
your behavior

804.16 --> 807.76
your behavior and

805.76 --> 812.48
the fact that you think that

807.76 --> 812.48
vodka early is normal and all that

813.2 --> 820.0790000000001
the james webb yeah

816.72 --> 820.0790000000001
that's the one mike sudanich

822.48 --> 826.279
hello raise my gypsies

830.88 --> 833.88
ugh

848.079 --> 852.399
yeah i have a bit of a weird tension

850.0 --> 854.079
thing back in my intestines it's

852.399 --> 855.279
annoying

854.079 --> 857.3599999999999
yesterday

855.279 --> 858.8
i don't know maybe it's maybe it came

857.36 --> 863.36
from

858.8 --> 863.3599999999999
not doing the show i don't know this is

869.04 --> 874.639
okay

871.839 --> 878.7600000000001
jws i don't know what that means what

874.639 --> 878.76
what does that mean tara 306

884.0 --> 889.279
yeah gadget inspector vegfist yes

886.16 --> 891.04
because he was a vegan like he's like a

889.279 --> 893.8389999999999
vegan activist

891.04 --> 896.88
and with the fist that already gets kind

893.839 --> 899.9200000000001
of like sjw symbolism

896.88 --> 901.8389999999999
so yeah of course

899.92 --> 903.8389999999999
i wonder why it took so long but

901.839 --> 908.1600000000001
eventually i figured out that his his

903.839 --> 908.1600000000001
real name is actually vag fist

908.88 --> 912.639
right

911.12 --> 914.5600000000001
gross

912.639 --> 917.44
normally if somebody made that joke in

914.56 --> 919.279
my chat i would say like a bad

917.44 --> 923.12
bad person but

919.279 --> 923.12
i made the joke don't

923.519 --> 930.8
don't take any habits from that but yeah

927.68 --> 934.3199999999999
the guy was a complete sociopath and was

930.8 --> 934.3199999999999
like basically arguing

935.12 --> 941.12
baby murder and body parts and just

938.0 --> 944.399
really [ __ ] psycho

941.12 --> 944.399
like that's how he ended up

947.12 --> 952.8
it was definitely well spectacular in a

949.759 --> 955.1990000000001
way and i i'd love to have your

952.8 --> 958.88
view on that turret since you actually

955.199 --> 961.12
live among those people

958.88 --> 963.519
and i want to know if you recognize more

and they pop up everywhere they they

987.519 --> 992.639
feel like it's like they're supposed to

989.92 --> 995.12
like show everybody they're there

992.639 --> 997.839
like it's a virtue to be them really

995.12 --> 997.839
weird

1003.6 --> 1008.16
i don't know what vegan means okay vegan

1005.839 --> 1011.0400000000001
means that you have no that you don't

1008.16 --> 1012.56
consume any animal products including

1011.04 --> 1013.06
milk

1012.56 --> 1014.56
cheese

1013.06 --> 1015.8389999999999
[Music]

1014.56 --> 1017.04
and

1015.839 --> 1017.9200000000001
i think

1017.04 --> 1018.8
some

1017.92 --> 1019.5999999999999
even

1018.8 --> 1022.0
like

1019.6 --> 1024.319
say that that includes like clothing and

1022.0 --> 1027.28
all that i don't know exactly

1024.319 --> 1030.319
it's just like don't

1027.28 --> 1032.24
don't use milk or eggs nothing right

1030.319 --> 1034.079
nothing that comes from an animal that's

1032.24 --> 1038.039
vegan

1034.079 --> 1038.039
i don't recommend it

1039.199 --> 1042.199
right

1045.69 --> 1048.8690000000001
[Music]

1051.33 --> 1054.56
[Music]

1063.76 --> 1068.16
right but the whole vegan thing really

1065.679 --> 1070.72
was kind of like a side

1068.16 --> 1072.799
it started out with that because jim bob

1070.72 --> 1075.1200000000001
typically likes to go at it

1072.799 --> 1077.9189999999999
philosophically with vegans it's very

1075.12 --> 1080.7199999999998
interesting when he does that

1077.919 --> 1083.2800000000002
but yeah this guy just showed another

1080.72 --> 1085.84
side to him and that really became

1083.28 --> 1087.77
the the focal point of the conversation

1085.84 --> 1090.9599999999998
and

1087.77 --> 1093.6
[Music]

1090.96 --> 1097.4
because it became all about abortion and

1093.6 --> 1097.3999999999999
[ __ ] and just

1111.2 --> 1115.52
talk with such vegans yeah well that's

1113.44 --> 1118.559
actually one of what

1115.52 --> 1119.84
typical vegans are like

1118.559 --> 1122.3999999999999
right

1119.84 --> 1123.9189999999999
you're not a vegan and then like oh yeah

1122.4 --> 1125.8400000000001
sure

1123.919 --> 1128.5590000000002
i'll drink some milk no no the whole

1125.84 --> 1131.28
point is then you're a vegetarian you're

1128.559 --> 1131.28
not a vegan

1131.52 --> 1136.96
vegan specifically doesn't use milk

1133.6 --> 1138.32
products or eats eggs

1136.96 --> 1141.919
right

1138.32 --> 1141.9189999999999
hey jeff gassett good to see you

1147.84 --> 1151.36
again sorry guys for those who are

1150.16 --> 1153.039
tuning in

1151.36 --> 1156.8799999999999
yeah sorry for me not showing up

1153.039 --> 1159.52
yesterday i overslept extremely

1156.88 --> 1162.0800000000002
and i thought like it's i just need a

1159.52 --> 1164.4
day off

1162.08 --> 1166.559
but yeah if you're wondering like oh

1164.4 --> 1167.8400000000001
what's going on where's irwin why didn't

1166.559 --> 1171.2
he show up

1167.84 --> 1174.24
first place i'd go to is to my twitter

1171.2 --> 1176.48
go to my twitter check it out keep track

1174.24 --> 1179.039
if

1176.48 --> 1180.48
something happened i'll still say it

1179.039 --> 1182.8799999999999
there

1180.48 --> 1185.1200000000001
right instead of what i did before

1182.88 --> 1187.1200000000001
like leave a comment in my comment

1185.12 --> 1189.76
section on the last video well comment

1187.12 --> 1193.7199999999998
section is off now go to twitter and

1189.76 --> 1193.72
check out what i say there

1203.919 --> 1210.0800000000002
they do go got safari time to yeah yeah

1207.679 --> 1212.24
well veganism makes it a lot harder not

1210.08 --> 1215.1999999999998
to go cevonye

1212.24 --> 1219.88
it's because of the

1215.2 --> 1219.88
the metabolism of it all

1220.72 --> 1225.44
it just makes you more viable more

1223.84 --> 1228.8799999999999
susceptible

1225.44 --> 1231.52
to suffering syndrome behavior

1228.88 --> 1233.44
really and it's it sounds so silly right

1231.52 --> 1234.72
when i say it that way but it actually

1233.44 --> 1236.4
like

1234.72 --> 1238.88
you could

1236.4 --> 1241.6000000000001
not call it safanye syndrome and like be

1238.88 --> 1243.679
more detailed mechanical i just like to

1241.6 --> 1245.12
call it safonya syndrome because it's so

1243.679 --> 1249.6000000000001
easy

1245.12 --> 1251.1999999999998
it's like a historical reference point

1249.6 --> 1254.1589999999999
to me

1251.2 --> 1256.32
within social media

1254.159 --> 1259.7600000000002
but it really does happen

1256.32 --> 1259.76
like it's a thing out there

1260.72 --> 1264.48
we have teeth to eat meat

1265.039 --> 1268.1589999999999
yeah arguably

1275.039 --> 1280.559
i mean yeah both

1277.6 --> 1280.559
we can eat anything

1282.4 --> 1287.1200000000001
they eat a lot of seeds right there's

1285.12 --> 1290.08
nothing wrong with that

1287.12 --> 1291.9189999999999
although yeah even like nut and all that

1290.08 --> 1292.799
good source for protein a lot of the

1291.919 --> 1293.679
time

1292.799 --> 1296.799
but

1293.679 --> 1298.3200000000002
it's much tougher on the digestive

1296.799 --> 1300.24
system

1298.32 --> 1303.2
yeah

1300.24 --> 1305.1200000000001
nuts or have good protein but they do

1303.2 --> 1309.44
not end good fats

1305.12 --> 1309.4399999999998
but they do not assimilate as easily

1315.84 --> 1319.799
cows have teeth too

1326.08 --> 1330.84
yeah but cows have different type of

1327.919 --> 1334.919
teeth cows don't have

1330.84 --> 1334.9189999999999
meat teeth

1346.4 --> 1350.4
right they don't have the

1348.799 --> 1352.6399999999999
the fang

1350.4 --> 1355.2800000000002
humans have like

1352.64 --> 1357.6000000000001
very basic it's not like a vampire but

1355.28 --> 1358.84
we have

1357.6 --> 1362.0
that type of

1358.84 --> 1363.6
teeth that is associated with the

1362.0 --> 1365.919
ability to

1363.6 --> 1369.28
rend me to like

1365.919 --> 1372.679
bite off a chunk of that dynamic stuff

1369.28 --> 1372.6789999999999
that is meat

1375.28 --> 1379.79
canines what

1376.54 --> 1379.79
[Music]

1383.679 --> 1390.0
mainly molars and columns yeah yeah

1385.6 --> 1393.36
molars to grind and front row typical

1390.0 --> 1395.28
teeth to cut off things like roots and

1393.36 --> 1396.3999999999999
or branches or whatever that's going to

1395.28 --> 1398.72
be

1396.4 --> 1400.88
you got the cutting tools you got the

1398.72 --> 1403.1200000000001
grinders and then if you want to if

1400.88 --> 1404.24
you're a meat eater you got a couple of

1403.12 --> 1406.8799999999999
thanks

1404.24 --> 1406.88
so you can like

1407.679 --> 1413.6000000000001
you're kind of like a dog just like try

1409.679 --> 1417.8400000000001
to rent a piece of flesh right

1413.6 --> 1417.84
that's technically what that is

1421.2 --> 1425.279
hippos have the biggest canines

1426.32 --> 1431.279
yeah but

1427.84 --> 1434.32
hippos do actually swallow

1431.279 --> 1436.48
meat like hippos freaking swallow

1434.32 --> 1439.76
animals whole

1436.48 --> 1443.279
yeah the hippos are freaking insane

1439.76 --> 1445.039
i mean yeah they typically eat

1443.279 --> 1446.08
plants

1445.039 --> 1448.799
but

1446.08 --> 1450.559
like if some animal

1448.799 --> 1452.6399999999999
gets like caught in the water and

1450.559 --> 1455.12
they're in a bad mood they're gonna like

1452.64 --> 1457.279
squish it or like just

1455.12 --> 1459.84
swallow it

1457.279 --> 1459.84
[ __ ] it up

1460.72 --> 1466.0
but yeah they i mean their teeth

1463.6 --> 1466.8799999999999
they have like huge

1466.0 --> 1470.0
like

1466.88 --> 1470.7990000000002
hook almost like teeth right

1470.0 --> 1473.039
i

1470.799 --> 1475.44
that always looked to me more like

1473.039 --> 1477.6
elephant type teeth and elephant teeth

1475.44 --> 1480.799
those aren't like meat fangs i don't

1477.6 --> 1480.799
know what that is

1482.08 --> 1486.6399999999999
like

1483.52 --> 1489.039
they use it more like antlers

1486.64 --> 1490.72
like fighting sticks

1489.039 --> 1493.919
from their mouth

1490.72 --> 1496.48
right like elephants do and i think that

1493.919 --> 1498.96
hippos also just kind of use them as

1496.48 --> 1498.96
just like

1499.279 --> 1504.4
just crush things not necessarily to

1502.08 --> 1506.24
rend flesh

1504.4 --> 1508.72
don't upset a hippo that's right they're

1506.24 --> 1512.24
the most dangerous freaking animal

1508.72 --> 1514.21
probably on the planet uh on the planet

1512.24 --> 1517.319
in the realm

1514.21 --> 1517.319
[Music]

1517.76 --> 1524.44
extremely territorial

1520.48 --> 1524.44
and like they go berserk

1531.279 --> 1535.919
and they're extremely fast too i mean

1533.679 --> 1538.0800000000002
those creatures can run and they can

1535.919 --> 1539.919
swim pretty fast

1538.08 --> 1542.9189999999999
like you don't expect that the way they

1539.919 --> 1542.919
look

1543.12 --> 1547.52
hippos are not herbivores

1546.4 --> 1550.4
okay

1547.52 --> 1550.4
george sanford

1554.799 --> 1559.36
oh really

1556.64 --> 1561.919
okay held to the chef

1559.36 --> 1561.9189999999999
interesting

1566.48 --> 1571.279
huh so they do have all those types of

1569.2 --> 1573.279
teeth interesting i didn't even realize

1571.279 --> 1575.679
that

1573.279 --> 1576.96
they in fact eat meat yeah i know

1575.679 --> 1578.24
but they're not

1576.96 --> 1580.72
like

1578.24 --> 1584.84
they just eat what do you call that

1580.72 --> 1584.84
animals that just eat everything

1598.64 --> 1603.6000000000001
monkeys yeah

1601.36 --> 1604.7199999999998
monkeys eat plants mostly but yeah they

1603.6 --> 1607.1999999999998
still

1604.72 --> 1608.64
it's the brain capacity you see

1607.2 --> 1610.799
it's the

1608.64 --> 1613.039
if an animal has like potential for

1610.799 --> 1614.48
extreme intelligence they're gonna end

1613.039 --> 1616.72
up just like

1614.48 --> 1619.44
having to eat

1616.72 --> 1621.6000000000001
animals or whatever things that are

1619.44 --> 1624.0
extremely high on protein that that is

1621.6 --> 1625.9189999999999
just typical

1624.0 --> 1628.24
omnivores that's the word yeah thank you

1625.919 --> 1628.24
for that

1629.039 --> 1633.76
i don't know why i'm not having this

1630.72 --> 1635.44
word range available to me

1633.76 --> 1637.76
today as much

1635.44 --> 1640.0
i don't know what's going on

1637.76 --> 1643.039
[Music]

1640.0 --> 1645.679
i mean these are basic things that

1643.039 --> 1647.44
are exactly the same in dutch

1645.679 --> 1650.76
and this is like i learned this when i

1647.44 --> 1650.76
was 10.

1666.72 --> 1670.48
huh okay gorzilla thanks

1671.36 --> 1673.76
wow

1678.72 --> 1683.84
pig me hippies hippos are they really

1681.44 --> 1683.8400000000001
small

1686.0 --> 1691.12
man i didn't even know there were that

1687.6 --> 1691.12
many different types of hippos

1694.559 --> 1698.96
just google it

1696.64 --> 1698.96
right

1705.12 --> 1711.4799999999998
i don't how did we get onto hippos and

1708.08 --> 1711.48
what they eat

1713.52 --> 1719.44
oh yeah

1715.2 --> 1719.44
vegfist the conversation with jim bob

1719.84 --> 1723.72
that's how it got there

1729.12 --> 1735.52
okay gadget inspector

1732.48 --> 1735.52
yeah but look and

1736.48 --> 1741.279
a lot of

1739.12 --> 1742.399
uh bird types

1741.279 --> 1743.2
they'll just

1742.399 --> 1745.6
eat

1743.2 --> 1747.76
meat you know they'll just

1745.6 --> 1750.6399999999999
they don't hunt necessarily but they're

1747.76 --> 1753.64
a lot of birds are like scavenger meat

1750.64 --> 1753.64
eaters

1754.88 --> 1758.88
like they'll if they're opportunists

1757.36 --> 1760.9599999999998
like if it's there they're going to take

1758.88 --> 1764.0
a bite

1760.96 --> 1766.64
birds eat each other yeah effectively

1764.0 --> 1770.0
a lot of them do

1766.64 --> 1772.88
and a lot of birds like focus on that

1770.0 --> 1776.64
they are scavenger birds

1772.88 --> 1776.64
but al most of them

1777.039 --> 1784.08
especially what is the the crow types

1780.72 --> 1786.159
most of them like scavenge

1784.08 --> 1787.1999999999998
it's it's especially like the smaller

1786.159 --> 1789.5200000000002
birds

1787.2 --> 1791.76
like they're really small ones that they

1789.52 --> 1794.559
just eat insects

1791.76 --> 1796.96
worms and nuts and they never take a

1794.559 --> 1799.12
bite out of flesh

1796.96 --> 1802.1200000000001
they're real small birds they don't do

1799.12 --> 1802.12
that

1818.24 --> 1822.24
the indian cow with the hump is the

1820.32 --> 1824.559
original what what are you talking about

1822.24 --> 1824.559
terry

1825.039 --> 1828.08
it's not like a

1826.32 --> 1830.6399999999999
sort of a

1828.08 --> 1833.12
i have seen those it's almost like camel

1830.64 --> 1834.72
cows aren't they

1833.12 --> 1837.7199999999998
kind of weird

1834.72 --> 1837.72
interesting

1854.24 --> 1861.48
hmm

1856.76 --> 1861.48
[Music]

1871.2 --> 1873.919
hey leon

1875.2 --> 1878.559
yeah yeah

1876.64 --> 1880.48
no crows are very

1878.559 --> 1882.399
socially intelligent

1880.48 --> 1884.88
just like

1882.399 --> 1887.12
and they like even understand other

1884.88 --> 1890.3990000000001
birds

1887.12 --> 1893.4399999999998
that's so interesting about them

1893.44 --> 1898.24
animal social behavior of other species

1898.399 --> 1901.6789999999999
i think they just do that

1901.84 --> 1907.6399999999999
maybe because they're bored and they

1903.44 --> 1907.64
can't i'm not sure

1922.08 --> 1925.08
what

1939.12 --> 1942.2399999999998

1948.159 --> 1952.24
spider not too sure

like through the fed show when it came

1973.12 --> 1976.4799999999998
to that subject i think it was during

1975.2 --> 1981.039
the live show even

1976.48 --> 1981.039
with some documentary about lemmings

1981.2 --> 1985.039

1985.36 --> 1988.399
tundra tiger

1987.36 --> 1990.399
area

1988.399 --> 1992.32
guinea pigs that's basically what they

1990.399 --> 1994.799
are that's what they look like

1992.32 --> 1995.8799999999999

2027.279 --> 2032.72
i didn't get all the way through though

2029.279 --> 2035.44
because it is like 50 minutes

2032.72 --> 2037.3600000000001
but like i'm yeah

2035.44 --> 2040.48
i'm gonna continue watching it because

2037.36 --> 2044.279

2104.72 --> 2109.0789999999997
conversation about it on fvd

even mean who are you talking about

2188.88 --> 2194.48
i know who dr doolittle is and all that

2191.44 --> 2198.68

what are you comparing it to

2205.76 --> 2209.32
oh okay

2227.839 --> 2229.92
you

2292.32 --> 2297.44

2297.44 --> 2301.68
inspector please don't show up drunk

that's just racist then white

2346.24 --> 2350.3199999999997
french are not always just drunk

2350.56 --> 2355.7999999999997
it's not true

2352.079 --> 2355.8
they're just [ __ ]

2370.88 --> 2374.48
what are the french erase

2377.599 --> 2382.7200000000003
well in this instance they are

2380.96 --> 2385.04
because otherwise what i said made no

2382.72 --> 2385.04
sense

2392.8 --> 2397.52
why do i say

2394.24 --> 2400.0
french [ __ ] because apparently in

2397.52 --> 2402.64
france it's okay to just

2400.0 --> 2405.76
go and drink vodka in the middle of the

2402.64 --> 2405.7599999999998
early afternoon

2407.44 --> 2411.4
i think that's kind of [ __ ]

2430.96 --> 2435.599
but yeah gadget inspector considering

2433.28 --> 2438.4
your irish background

2435.599 --> 2441.76
like that's an extra risk factor i mean

2438.4 --> 2443.28
you're an irishman

2441.76 --> 2445.3590000000004
in france

2443.28 --> 2448.1600000000003
getting drunk in the middle of the

2445.359 --> 2450.16
afternoon on vodka this is

2448.16 --> 2452.24
pretty serious

2450.16 --> 2456.0789999999997
i hope you know what you're doing this

2452.24 --> 2456.0789999999997
could get out of hand really bad

2464.24 --> 2469.7599999999998
but when you get up at 6 00 am

2467.92 --> 2471.839

2469.76 --> 2473.6800000000003

2473.68 --> 2476.96
now you're drunk and even though you

2475.599 --> 2479.04
have a rhythm where

2476.96 --> 2482.56
you can handle that

2479.04 --> 2483.359
you're drunk in the middle of the day

2482.56 --> 2487.04
with

2483.359 --> 2488.0
all other people in your surroundings

2487.04 --> 2490.64

alcoholics

2494.8 --> 2500.4
who said drunk dude you're on vodka

2498.72 --> 2502.7999999999997

2502.8 --> 2507.3590000000004
i'm not saying you're like full blown

2505.119 --> 2508.4
out of your mind drunk and dizzy and

2507.359 --> 2511.44
puking

2508.4 --> 2513.6800000000003

it's been very much taken notice off

2545.599 --> 2551.839
historically of actually yeah being like

2548.64 --> 2551.839
that so yeah

2560.56 --> 2564.96
right sir here even gadget inspector

2563.2 --> 2567.96
gets it but it might be because he's

2564.96 --> 2567.96
drunk

[Music]

2580.16 --> 2584.72

cool you're in france you're an irishman

2623.119 --> 2627.359
in france you're pretty cool

2625.92 --> 2629.76
when you're drunk

2627.359 --> 2632.96
when you're drinking i get the feeling

2629.76 --> 2635.28
you get the worst of both worlds

2632.96 --> 2637.68
you get the typical drunk attitude from

2635.28 --> 2642.1600000000003
the irish and then you get the [ __ ]

2637.68 --> 2642.16
humor from the french this is terrible

2642.319 --> 2645.7599999999998
unless somebody like thinks that's

2644.16 --> 2647.7599999999998
really funny

2645.76 --> 2651.0400000000004
maybe the french thinks dude maybe

2647.76 --> 2653.76
you're like the ultimate french comedian

2651.04 --> 2655.359
maybe you could do stand-up comedy and

2653.76 --> 2656.96
the french would be like oh that's

2655.359 --> 2658.72
amazing

2656.96 --> 2659.839
so funny

2658.72 --> 2662.48

2659.839 --> 2664.14
me

3017.119 --> 3021.6800000000003
no no not just always no it's about the

3019.359 --> 3023.68
behavior it's not just if you're always

3021.68 --> 3025.44
in toxic it's if you're occasionally

3023.68 --> 3027.2
talk intoxicated

3025.44 --> 3029.839
look if you're gonna

3027.2 --> 3032.24
go party with your friends and you're

3029.839 --> 3035.2
like oh let's all get drunk and like

3032.24 --> 3036.0789999999997
hang out in the woods or something

3035.2 --> 3037.68
fine

3036.079 --> 3040.0
yeah you're gonna act drunk you're gonna

3037.68 --> 3044.3999999999996
act like complete retards that's fine

3040.0 --> 3047.28
you're all doing it you came to do that

3044.4 --> 3049.76
it's okay to let go then a little right

3047.28 --> 3052.559
but if you just drink and then show up

3049.76 --> 3055.6800000000003
to a place that's not about that that's

3052.559 --> 3057.44
not some cafe for you to get drunk

3055.68 --> 3062.0789999999997
and then you start like oh you're

3057.44 --> 3062.079
drinking oh it's all normal that's a sin

3062.24 --> 3069.0
i mean it is a drug

3064.8 --> 3069.0
you shouldn't normalize that

3073.28 --> 3076.3190000000004
hello true niece

3079.44 --> 3082.48
quit drinking

3080.8 --> 3086.0
your body can handle it yeah that's the

3082.48 --> 3086.0
best reason to quit drinking

3090.72 --> 3093.72
right

3097.04 --> 3102.079
well my body can't drinking i can't

3099.52 --> 3102.88
handle drinking very well either

3102.079 --> 3106.6400000000003
but

3102.88 --> 3109.28
i do still do it because

3106.64 --> 3110.4
i like i do get the enjoyment it's just

3109.28 --> 3113.3590000000004
that

3110.4 --> 3114.559
like one beer too much and i'll get

3113.359 --> 3116.16
really sick

3114.559 --> 3120.3190000000004
like it

3116.16 --> 3122.7999999999997
my meter goes full very quickly

3120.319 --> 3126.96
and then it goes down again very quickly

3122.8 --> 3129.8390000000004
so my body can process it it's just

3126.96 --> 3133.04
i can't handle a large quantity

3129.839 --> 3135.359
but i get the influence of alcohol very

3133.04 --> 3138.079
quickly

3135.359 --> 3139.68
so yeah you could say i get drunk easy

3138.079 --> 3142.1600000000003
cheap

3139.68 --> 3144.0
and i'm able to process it out of my

3142.16 --> 3146.48
body again so that i don't have a

3144.0 --> 3149.119
hangover the next day unless i drink

3146.48 --> 3151.68
just one freaking beer too much

3149.119 --> 3153.92
and then everything turns around then

3151.68 --> 3156.319
suddenly i don't have it under control

3153.92 --> 3157.359
and then suddenly the next day i do feel

3156.319 --> 3159.52
sick

3157.359 --> 3159.52
so

3162.16 --> 3166.319
do i smoke dope with my beer

3170.88 --> 3173.52
yes i do

3173.76 --> 3178.96
also in very small amounts i don't go

3176.96 --> 3179.68
like stalking

3178.96 --> 3180.8
like

3179.68 --> 3183.2
yeah i

3180.8 --> 3184.6400000000003
guys don't smoke i'm not a hard smoker

3183.2 --> 3188.0789999999997
like that anyway

3184.64 --> 3190.4
but yeah i like the combination

3188.079 --> 3192.1600000000003
it gets much worse fast

3190.4 --> 3194.559
yeah well

3192.16 --> 3197.7599999999998
i'm kind of used to it

3194.559 --> 3199.76
i mean i've been doing it for like

3197.76 --> 3201.5200000000004
half my life

3199.76 --> 3205.0400000000004
altogether

3201.52 --> 3208.24
combination of beer but only beer not

3205.04 --> 3209.359
other hard drinks only beer

3208.24 --> 3210.9599999999996
with

3209.359 --> 3214.0
like

3210.96 --> 3218.359
not too strong cannabis and not too much

3214.0 --> 3218.359
yeah it works out great for me

3224.88 --> 3229.359
where it doesn't work out great though

3226.72 --> 3230.5589999999997
is if i'm actually supposed to do

3229.359 --> 3233.04
something

3230.559 --> 3237.079
like an activity or work

3233.04 --> 3237.079
that's when it doesn't work

3240.8 --> 3244.52
symbol hmm

3250.24 --> 3255.7599999999998
okay leon

3252.96 --> 3257.68
very easy drunk

3255.76 --> 3261.5200000000004
right one of those

3257.68 --> 3263.44
yeah i don't have that effect thank god

3261.52 --> 3266.16
i mean i get like

3263.44 --> 3268.559
a little but i don't go like i don't

3266.16 --> 3270.7999999999997
like immediately go ape [ __ ] like some

3268.559 --> 3273.2000000000003
people when they like get just a few

3270.8 --> 3275.52
sips i've seen that

3273.2 --> 3279.319
it's crazy they just take one sip and

3275.52 --> 3279.319
they just go like

3283.93 --> 3287.1699999999996
[Music]

3294.4 --> 3297.599
beer then but yeah

3299.44 --> 3301.44
but

3300.319 --> 3302.799
dude i

3301.44 --> 3306.319
i don't know why

3302.799 --> 3308.24
why did i drag this subject into this

3306.319 --> 3311.04
i wanted to stop talking about it now

3308.24 --> 3314.0
everybody's talking about ugh what did i

3311.04 --> 3314.0
do god

3315.52 --> 3319.929
just

3316.87 --> 3319.929
[Music]

3320.48 --> 3325.68
look

3322.4 --> 3328.7200000000003
in reality drinking and smoking is for

3325.68 --> 3330.64
people that are bored

3328.72 --> 3334.8799999999997
if you don't do it and you just keep

3330.64 --> 3335.839
yourself busy with creativity and

3334.88 --> 3337.839
art

3335.839 --> 3340.319
art is a much better way to spend your

3337.839 --> 3340.319
energy

3342.88 --> 3349.6400000000003
much better than stupid

3345.76 --> 3349.6400000000003
entertainment drugs

3350.4 --> 3353.359
so yeah

3354.0 --> 3359.599
i mean yeah i smoke yeah i drink

3356.799 --> 3362.16
but i'm not freaking proud of it

3359.599 --> 3363.6800000000003
i do consider it as a sin even though i

3362.16 --> 3366.8799999999997
am

3363.68 --> 3368.72
very carefully managing it and getting

3366.88 --> 3371.359
something out of it but it's very

3368.72 --> 3373.7599999999998
specific it's very niche it's not like

3371.359 --> 3376.24
oh man this is the ultimate opportunity

3373.76 --> 3378.4
everybody should do this because you can

3376.24 --> 3381.04
get this and this no no no it's very

3378.4 --> 3382.319
specific it effectively assists me in

3381.04 --> 3385.359
dreamwalking

3382.319 --> 3388.839
it does it in a very unique way

3385.359 --> 3393.04
i've never seen anybody else

3388.839 --> 3395.599
ever that would do what i do

3393.04 --> 3398.4
and then have the same effect

3395.599 --> 3400.48
so it might just be unique

3398.4 --> 3402.079
to me

3400.48 --> 3406.16
somewhat

3402.079 --> 3406.1600000000003
probably not as unique as i think

3407.839 --> 3412.5589999999997
right

3410.16 --> 3414.8799999999997
but just because i can do something sort

3412.559 --> 3417.3590000000004
of useful and entertaining with it for

3414.88 --> 3419.359
myself doesn't mean that oh that means

3417.359 --> 3422.72
it's a good thing that means oh i could

3419.359 --> 3425.04
recommend it to everybody no no

3422.72 --> 3426.72
i don't

3425.04 --> 3428.88
but yeah if you're gonna go that way

3426.72 --> 3431.4399999999996
make sure you go organic make sure you

3428.88 --> 3434.96
get raw tobacco and not

3431.44 --> 3437.04
some mega corporation big tobacco crap

3434.96 --> 3438.319
with poison in it

3437.04 --> 3440.079
right

3438.319 --> 3442.0
if you're gonna go for

3440.079 --> 3444.559
weeds then make sure you don't get the

3442.0 --> 3447.04
weaponized weeds

3444.559 --> 3449.3590000000004
not too strong

3447.04 --> 3451.119
and figure out how would they work like

3449.359 --> 3453.7599999999998
there's different strains and they have

3451.119 --> 3455.839
radically different influences i like

3453.76 --> 3458.1600000000003
the indiga

3455.839 --> 3461.92
that's my type

3458.16 --> 3466.16
that work good on me that are like

3461.92 --> 3466.16
that that works in um

3466.48 --> 3470.96
indica

3467.52 --> 3474.64
indica strains work with beer for me if

3470.96 --> 3476.4
it's not an indica strain

3474.64 --> 3477.92
and i don't know it because i don't know

3476.4 --> 3479.839
what it's even asked it's just like oh

3477.92 --> 3482.88
this is new i'll try it and then i drink

3479.839 --> 3485.44
beer that can go really wrong

3482.88 --> 3486.96
like really weird ways that i get sick

3485.44 --> 3490.48
and all that

3486.96 --> 3493.119
so yeah it's not all peachy

3490.48 --> 3493.119
and easy

3494.0 --> 3498.799
weaponized weed seems like an oxymoron

3496.4 --> 3501.119
yeah but it isn't i'm talking about like

3498.799 --> 3502.799
californian weeds that are just

3501.119 --> 3504.559
unnatural

3502.799 --> 3506.4
they just over

3504.559 --> 3508.88
pimp it

3506.4 --> 3512.079
and it's not even it just

3508.88 --> 3514.319
it seems almost chemical

3512.079 --> 3517.3590000000004
i just like really

3514.319 --> 3519.92
natural organic grown

3517.359 --> 3519.92
cannabis

3520.48 --> 3525.16
not overly hybridized if possible

3529.59 --> 3532.789
[Music]

3544.16 --> 3548.8799999999997
what

3545.119 --> 3550.7200000000003
poor knuckle wumbo that's crazy

3548.88 --> 3552.88
delivery driver that's drunk and the

3550.72 --> 3556.359
police doesn't do anything about it that

3552.88 --> 3556.359
makes no sense

3562.559 --> 3566.4
borderline hallucinogenic well

3566.72 --> 3571.839
no it's not borderline it is effect look

3569.599 --> 3573.52
cannabis especially the weaponized is

3571.839 --> 3575.52
hallucinogenic

3573.52 --> 3578.96
and any cannabis have can have

3575.52 --> 3581.52
hallucinogenic effects

3578.96 --> 3582.96
what is an hallucinogen what is when

3581.52 --> 3585.119
that happens

3582.96 --> 3587.04
it's always based on tension something

3585.119 --> 3588.96
that's unresolved

3587.04 --> 3591.599
and then it expresses itself through

3588.96 --> 3593.76
your subconscious into the hallucination

3591.599 --> 3595.28
it's like the dream catching up on you

3593.76 --> 3598.4
except it does it

3595.28 --> 3601.0400000000004
right when you're awake

3598.4 --> 3603.359
through the chemical it's like a waking

3601.04 --> 3603.359
dream

3604.96 --> 3610.7200000000003
the problem with the the weaponized

3607.52 --> 3612.839
weeds that are too high on thc is that

3610.72 --> 3615.4399999999996
the amount is just

3612.839 --> 3616.96
overwhelming your mind will not be able

3615.44 --> 3618.88
to handle that

3616.96 --> 3619.839
it's really meant for people that are

3618.88 --> 3622.559
heavy

3619.839 --> 3625.52
heavy cannabis smoker addicts

3622.559 --> 3627.2000000000003
that just constantly have to do it

3625.52 --> 3630.0
because to them they get used to it so

3627.2 --> 3633.1189999999997
they get the stronger tac to still feel

3630.0 --> 3636.559
something right well when i

3633.119 --> 3639.599
get my cannabis i don't give a [ __ ]

3636.559 --> 3643.119
well oh i have to get high i have to get

3639.599 --> 3646.079
the hit on my head effect no no i don't

3643.119 --> 3648.799
i don't even want that really

3646.079 --> 3651.92
that's like a side effect to me

3648.799 --> 3654.799
i don't do it for that i don't have to

3651.92 --> 3657.28
get that kick every time

3654.799 --> 3659.2
to me it's about the overall effect and

3657.28 --> 3661.599
if i don't get a hammer on the head

3659.2 --> 3665.5989999999997
effect i'm actually happier

3661.599 --> 3665.599
i'm happier when i don't get that

3665.76 --> 3672.3190000000004
because i'm not like a high kick junkie

3670.559 --> 3674.6400000000003
i don't need to oh i need to get that

3672.319 --> 3676.88
kick and hey to be fair when i was

3674.64 --> 3678.96
younger i was that

3676.88 --> 3682.4
i was that

3678.96 --> 3683.28
pretty much from 15 to 21 i was very

3682.4 --> 3685.76
much

3683.28 --> 3688.96
like really addicted to the the high

3685.76 --> 3691.28
kick which i didn't get back then even

3688.96 --> 3693.04
a lot because it was very sensitive i'm

3691.28 --> 3695.6800000000003
still very sensitive but i've been the

3693.04 --> 3697.04
cannabis smoker most of my life almost

3695.68 --> 3699.9199999999996
half my life

3697.04 --> 3703.119
so i'm used to it i still get the kicks

3699.92 --> 3705.6800000000003
i don't seek them out anymore because

3703.119 --> 3708.559
i'm not using my smoking to

3705.68 --> 3711.1189999999997
escape from reality i'm not smacking

3708.559 --> 3712.559
myself on the head with the thc

3711.119 --> 3715.28
metaphorically

3712.559 --> 3717.3590000000004
to get myself high so i don't have to

3715.28 --> 3719.599
think about something that's going on in

3717.359 --> 3721.44
my life that i don't want to think about

3719.599 --> 3724.559
because that is what i was doing back

3721.44 --> 3726.64
then i did use it as escapism

3724.559 --> 3730.799
i was facing a lot of [ __ ] up things

3726.64 --> 3733.359
about reality that i could not handle

3730.799 --> 3735.28
i was starting to seep in that evil was

3733.359 --> 3736.799
actually real

3735.28 --> 3739.599
and all these things that i had

3736.799 --> 3742.96
imprinted onto my own spirit like oh

3739.599 --> 3745.92
it's all just an act like evil

3742.96 --> 3747.599
is like an act that's very inspiring so

3745.92 --> 3750.319
it keeps on happening

3747.599 --> 3752.079
stories are made about it and movies

3750.319 --> 3754.16
because it's inspiring but it's all fake

3752.079 --> 3756.88
that's what i thought and then face of

3754.16 --> 3760.3999999999996
certain things

3756.88 --> 3762.799
that showed no it's actually real and

3760.4 --> 3766.88
much worse than you'll ever get to see

3762.799 --> 3769.7599999999998
typically through stories and movies

3766.88 --> 3771.76
it's much harsher

3769.76 --> 3773.039
and there's no blanket

3771.76 --> 3774.96
in the way

3773.039 --> 3777.2000000000003
for your empathy

3774.96 --> 3779.76
and i couldn't handle that and yeah as a

3777.2 --> 3782.24
result i literally smoked the [ __ ] out

3779.76 --> 3783.44
of myself just to try to [ __ ] forget

3782.24 --> 3786.72
it all

3783.44 --> 3786.7200000000003
that's what happened a lot

3790.24 --> 3793.52
but i don't do that anymore

3794.839 --> 3800.5589999999997
because well took some time but i got

3798.16 --> 3802.0789999999997
over it

3800.559 --> 3804.7200000000003
i learned to

3802.079 --> 3807.2000000000003
realize this is the [ __ ] world it is

3804.72 --> 3811.0389999999998
and yeah and you not being able to

3807.2 --> 3813.9199999999996
handle that is also what the world is

3811.039 --> 3816.3190000000004
that's the challenge i face

3813.92 --> 3818.559
is what it is

3816.319 --> 3820.88
the only

3818.559 --> 3826.559
sensible response would to

3820.88 --> 3826.559
be to overcome it not to try to undo it

3826.64 --> 3830.0
that's what i have been doing

3832.88 --> 3837.359
but i come up with good stuff when i'm

3835.039 --> 3837.3590000000004
high

3837.68 --> 3841.2
yeah

3838.799 --> 3843.359
sure i do i know i do

3841.2 --> 3845.52
you know why

3843.359 --> 3848.64
why get good stuff when i'm high

3845.52 --> 3850.4
because it's evening

3848.64 --> 3854.96
it's dark

3850.4 --> 3854.96
it's the last part of the day

3855.68 --> 3859.0389999999998
now i become less

3857.44 --> 3860.7200000000003
presentable

3859.039 --> 3862.7990000000004
but my mind

3860.72 --> 3864.9599999999996
gets like

3862.799 --> 3866.4
like more refined even

3864.96 --> 3869.52
for a bit

3866.4 --> 3869.52
until it tires out

3870.319 --> 3875.0389999999998
yeah

3872.4 --> 3877.92
that effect doesn't work if i'd start

3875.039 --> 3879.119
smoking a lot and like drinking my beers

3877.92 --> 3881.92
early

3879.119 --> 3884.1600000000003
right it wouldn't work the same

3881.92 --> 3885.839
it's all about the timing

3884.16 --> 3888.0789999999997
everything is

3885.839 --> 3891.0389999999998
about the timing of when are you doing

3888.079 --> 3893.3590000000004
it how are you doing it what's the cycle

3891.039 --> 3896.48
like how are you managing your bodily

3893.359 --> 3896.48
recovery of it all

3898.48 --> 3905.64
do i smoke cannabis with tobacco yeah

3902.24 --> 3905.64
yes i do

3924.079 --> 3930.48
five to seven g top shelf i don't know

3927.039 --> 3930.48
what that means simon martin

3931.76 --> 3937.2000000000003
but yeah being a chain smoker sucks i'm

3934.48 --> 3939.28
sorry uh yeah

3937.2 --> 3942.0
you've rolled into that

3939.28 --> 3945.76
i do not change smoke

3942.0 --> 3948.48
i do not even smoke like cigarettes or

3945.76 --> 3951.8390000000004
check little my own rolled cigarettes i

3948.48 --> 3951.839
don't do that

3952.64 --> 3959.1189999999997
i only use it with cannabis

3956.88 --> 3962.079
or when i'm poor

3959.119 --> 3964.48
and i don't have cannabis then i'll like

3962.079 --> 3967.3590000000004
yeah smoking tobacco to me is like

3964.48 --> 3969.92
smoking a fake joint just to

3967.359 --> 3971.0389999999998
just to remind yourself what it sort of

3969.92 --> 3972.559
tastes like

3971.039 --> 3974.559
sounds really pathetic but it's good

3972.559 --> 3978.52
enough right i can

3974.559 --> 3978.52
tobacco is a lot cheaper

3978.96 --> 3984.4
tobacco makes you super tired

3981.76 --> 3987.5200000000004
well have you ever tried the actual

3984.4 --> 3989.2000000000003
naturally grown tobacco without

3987.52 --> 3990.559
all the garbage

3989.2 --> 3992.96
cigarette

3990.559 --> 3997.039
factories put on top of it have you ever

3992.96 --> 3998.88
actually tried the raw leaf

3997.039 --> 4001.76
that you have to cut up yourself you

3998.88 --> 4001.76
have to cut it up

4002.24 --> 4007.2
yourself have you ever tried that

4004.0 --> 4008.559
stasmaret's yeah that doesn't make you

4007.2 --> 4011.5989999999997
tired

4008.559 --> 4011.599
it's very different

4014.96 --> 4019.52
you just vape this stuff

4016.88 --> 4022.48
sure okay

4019.52 --> 4022.48
that's what you like

4027.839 --> 4032.88
but yeah a regular tobacco you get in

4030.4 --> 4036.2400000000002
the standardized tobacco pouches and all

4032.88 --> 4039.119
that that's not tobacco

4036.24 --> 4040.3999999999996
that's always with [ __ ] in it

4039.119 --> 4043.2000000000003
some

4040.4 --> 4046.079
brands have more [ __ ] than others

4043.2 --> 4048.64
but you gotta have it you've really got

4046.079 --> 4052.48
it at least once in your life

4048.64 --> 4055.2799999999997
try an actual real leaf

4052.48 --> 4056.48
nothing done with it but just being dry

4055.28 --> 4057.3590000000004
grown

4056.48 --> 4059.52
cut

4057.359 --> 4062.48
dried [ __ ]

4059.52 --> 4063.599
cut it up yourself try it try it one

4062.48 --> 4067.039
time

4063.599 --> 4069.92
it is a different experience trust me on

4067.039 --> 4072.4
this i have done this

4069.92 --> 4074.7200000000003
not on multiple locations twice i've

4072.4 --> 4077.76
ordered it from america

4074.72 --> 4078.9599999999996
it is a lot better i wish i could do it

4077.76 --> 4080.3190000000004
right now

4078.96 --> 4083.119
but it yeah

4080.319 --> 4086.48
that would cost me like 200 euros

4083.119 --> 4089.039
not something i have available right now

4086.48 --> 4091.839
i mean i had priorities supplements and

4089.039 --> 4091.8390000000004
all that

4095.92 --> 4099.92
but i do miss it

4097.839 --> 4104.199
it was so much better

4099.92 --> 4104.1990000000005
than typical pouch tobacco

4105.04 --> 4107.6
jesus

4107.759 --> 4111.6
that's disgusting gadget inspector

4110.0 --> 4113.12
really

4111.6 --> 4116.0
you're gonna bring it all the way to

4113.12 --> 4116.0
down to that

4116.839 --> 4121.6
god ar are you

4119.44 --> 4122.639999999999
you're trying to like dig into the

4121.6 --> 4127.2390000000005
bottom

4122.64 --> 4127.2390000000005
why are you doing this guy inspector

4139.359 --> 4145.159000000001
i mean that's just [ __ ] gross why

4141.839 --> 4145.159
would you even

4148.48 --> 4153.04
i mean yes i've known people that are

4150.719 --> 4154.64
stupid enough to do that why i'm not

4153.04 --> 4157.04
bringing that up why are you bringing

4154.64 --> 4157.04
that up

4157.199 --> 4161.259999999999
i mean what's next oh have you ever

4158.719 --> 4164.479
tried russian roulette

4161.26 --> 4164.479
[Music]

4164.56 --> 4168.0
yeah you should never try that yeah no

4167.12 --> 4171.88
[ __ ]

4168.0 --> 4171.88
why did you bring it up

4181.199 --> 4184.239
tobacco seeds

4186.159 --> 4192.879999999999
well flutter sage i don't know

4189.44 --> 4196.159
i try the same source as where i get my

4192.88 --> 4199.1990000000005
tobacco leaves i bet that they like you

4196.159 --> 4200.639999999999
could probably call them say like hey

4199.199 --> 4202.799999999999
can i

4200.64 --> 4204.08
have some of those seeds i want to try

4202.8 --> 4205.92
to

4204.08 --> 4207.44
like do it here too

4205.92 --> 4209.84
just

4207.44 --> 4212.0
also buy some of their leaves because

4209.84 --> 4214.0
that's their real product then

4212.0 --> 4217.679
right and then ask hey i want to try it

4214.0 --> 4219.52
out or like where can i get

4217.679 --> 4224.52
the right seeds but yeah of course the

4219.52 --> 4224.52
tobacco growers are gonna have seeds

4248.48 --> 4254.32
most of the vapes are added free so not

4251.36 --> 4258.0
all of them wow

4254.32 --> 4260.96
well you know what is additive free too

4258.0 --> 4264.56
raw tobacco leaves

4260.96 --> 4264.56
that's additive free too

4264.8 --> 4268.8
c-topia oh what's that

4270.56 --> 4275.4400000000005
oh nice

4272.8 --> 4275.4400000000005
oh wow

4275.52 --> 4280.320000000001
wow those tobacco plants look so

4277.84 --> 4280.32
beautiful

4280.88 --> 4284.28
that's amazing

4293.679 --> 4300.04
but where is this though

4296.56 --> 4300.04
where are they stationed

4307.76 --> 4310.56
it doesn't say

4311.679 --> 4316.96
oh wow they have like exotic plants too

4314.88 --> 4319.6
they got seeds of exotic

4316.96 --> 4319.6
trees and

4321.04 --> 4323.6
interesting

4325.6 --> 4332.320000000001
that's a pretty interesting link there

4328.8 --> 4332.320000000001
cb traveler thank you for that

4332.719 --> 4337.36
would be good to kind of know where they

4335.04 --> 4338.88
are though does they don't

4337.36 --> 4341.44
i don't understand

4338.88 --> 4343.28
where they're from

4341.44 --> 4345.759999999999
just contact us

4343.28 --> 4345.759999999999
that's it

4347.84 --> 4352.4800000000005
so is this like a

4350.08 --> 4356.28
a no nation shop or something

4352.48 --> 4356.28
international or

4356.56 --> 4360.159000000001
it's a death com so it should

4358.0 --> 4363.84
technically then be american

4360.159 --> 4363.839999999999
dot com is american right

4364.88 --> 4368.1990000000005
i don't know

4369.95 --> 4374.13
[Music]

4377.04 --> 4380.0
usa right

4381.36 --> 4386.32
but i am gonna store that link actually

4383.679 --> 4388.96
because that's really

4386.32 --> 4393.32
interesting it's good to

4388.96 --> 4393.32
have a resource like that

4412.4 --> 4414.719
hmm

4420.8 --> 4425.64
that's right bjc net yeah i know that

4435.199 --> 4439.239
german equivalent okay

4443.6 --> 4445.360000000001
yeah

4444.4 --> 4447.36
yeah that's

4445.36 --> 4450.48
dude but that's not just tobacco that

4447.36 --> 4452.96
also works for lattice

4450.48 --> 4455.44
when i had lattice i did that

4452.96 --> 4458.0
just leave it in there and just keep

4455.44 --> 4459.5199999999995
picking the the bottom leaves

4458.0 --> 4461.52
they're always the biggest and keeps

4459.52 --> 4464.88
growing and eventually it'll start like

4461.52 --> 4467.1990000000005
blooming and then it all gets all bitter

4464.88 --> 4469.6
but you could do like with one basic

4467.199 --> 4470.719
piece of one lettuce plant you could do

4469.6 --> 4473.52
like

4470.719 --> 4473.52
two weeks

4475.28 --> 4478.679
it was awesome

4485.84 --> 4492.4800000000005
yes hill to the chef yes i realized that

4488.719 --> 4492.4800000000005
that that was what you were saying

4494.159 --> 4499.36
yeah it gets bitter but yeah

4496.88 --> 4502.159000000001
it works great right i mean there's

4499.36 --> 4505.04
literally seeds coming out of them

4502.159 --> 4507.28
so you could just keep on doing that

4505.04 --> 4508.96
and then like during lattice seasons

4507.28 --> 4511.12
just like oh

4508.96 --> 4513.199
let's get some lettuce and keep on

4511.12 --> 4516.5599999999995
picking and then you they get the seeds

4513.199 --> 4516.5599999999995
again it's so easy

4520.64 --> 4525.4400000000005
but yeah you gotta have a

4523.04 --> 4526.8
a strain

4525.44 --> 4529.599999999999
of seeds

4526.8 --> 4532.320000000001
that will remain fertile like that they

4529.6 --> 4535.679
are going to make their own seeds

4532.32 --> 4535.679
you got to watch out for that

4536.0 --> 4540.08
and that's by the way universally

4538.56 --> 4541.679
universally you got to watch out for

4540.08 --> 4543.76
that that you don't get seeds that are

4541.679 --> 4545.84
like treated in a way that any plants

4543.76 --> 4547.84
coming from them are not going to be

4545.84 --> 4550.4800000000005
fertile

4547.84 --> 4551.679
because that is going to become a thing

4550.48 --> 4553.839999999999
more and more

4551.679 --> 4556.64
into the future

4553.84 --> 4559.84
because growers just have a lot of

4556.64 --> 4561.52
control universally over the plants they

4559.84 --> 4565.76
grow

4561.52 --> 4568.320000000001
and there's more knowledge forming

4565.76 --> 4570.64
a lot of it

4568.32 --> 4573.5199999999995
right it's not just the knowledge about

4570.64 --> 4576.64
how to deal with cannabis plants

4573.52 --> 4578.88
like ask rasta hat he knows a lot about

4576.64 --> 4582.320000000001
that's insane how much knowledge there

4578.88 --> 4586.36
even is about it what you can do

4582.32 --> 4586.36
and that's just one plant

4594.719 --> 4600.08
a couple of thousand cigarettes

4598.159 --> 4603.44
i don't know drew knees i don't i've

4600.08 --> 4607.12
never actually grown a tobacco plant

4603.44 --> 4609.28
i like i uh yeah ordered the raw leaves

4607.12 --> 4611.36
they were all dried up and was quite a

4609.28 --> 4614.719
lot of them but

4611.36 --> 4614.719
i don't really know how much

4615.52 --> 4621.1990000000005
tobacco leaf you get altogether from a

4618.8 --> 4623.4400000000005
single plant and it might all depend

4621.199 --> 4626.599999999999
like on the region right the heat and

4623.44 --> 4626.599999999999
all that

4653.76 --> 4657.92
a lot of that with tomato plants yes

4656.08 --> 4660.4
gadget inspector

4657.92 --> 4663.12
but it is kind of like the seed market

4660.4 --> 4665.839999999999
gilding it's a guild formation what's

4663.12 --> 4665.84
happening

4666.0 --> 4672.08
it's just that they've got all this

4667.76 --> 4673.84
knowledge they want you to buy the seeds

4672.08 --> 4675.36
well if they want you to buy the seeds

4673.84 --> 4677.84
then that means

4675.36 --> 4681.12
then effectively from a commercial

4677.84 --> 4683.6
perspective they don't want you to have

4681.12 --> 4685.5199999999995
your own seed production

4683.6 --> 4688.64
because they want you to buy their seeds

4685.52 --> 4691.6
now it doesn't have to be gmo

4688.64 --> 4692.8
but even with organic stuff you could

4691.6 --> 4694.56
still

4692.8 --> 4697.360000000001
yeah

4694.56 --> 4699.84
slightly modify

4697.36 --> 4701.679
the plant or not genetically but just

4699.84 --> 4703.52
through chemistry

4701.679 --> 4706.96
a lot of the times

4703.52 --> 4710.159000000001
to make sure that the seeds will grow a

4706.96 --> 4712.96
plant but the plant will not be fertile

4710.159 --> 4715.5199999999995
because they want you to keep buying the

4712.96 --> 4715.52
seeds

4715.92 --> 4719.4400000000005
it's guild formation this is what

4717.92 --> 4722.08
happens

4719.44 --> 4725.44
when knowledge builds up in an industry

4722.08 --> 4727.679
and makes the the users of it very

4725.44 --> 4729.199
self-sufficient and dynamic

4727.679 --> 4731.12
they're gonna

4729.199 --> 4733.36
get a little gravel

4731.12 --> 4735.599999999999
and they're gonna be just trying

4733.36 --> 4737.199
to keep their business going and that's

4735.6 --> 4740.8
one of the ways they're gonna try it and

4737.199 --> 4741.599999999999
it's gonna become more universal

4740.8 --> 4742.96
right

4741.6 --> 4744.64
it doesn't have to be the end of the

4742.96 --> 4746.56
world

4744.64 --> 4749.6
but it's not just like oh

4746.56 --> 4751.4400000000005
yeah i'm gonna get some seeds and then

4749.6 --> 4753.52
i'm gonna make my own seeds yeah good

4751.44 --> 4756.0
luck with that

4753.52 --> 4758.96
it's not gonna be as easy as you think

4756.0 --> 4760.0
unless you literally like go out in the

4758.96 --> 4762.08
wild

4760.0 --> 4765.04
find wild seeds and then start

4762.08 --> 4767.84
hybridizing them yourself

4765.04 --> 4770.159
which is very tedious

4767.84 --> 4774.360000000001
and takes a lot of time

4770.159 --> 4774.36
and effort and money probably

4782.32 --> 4787.759999999999
yes there is a seed vault somewhere i

4784.64 --> 4787.76
know stats moretz

4788.64 --> 4793.4400000000005
but there is still plenty of

4791.36 --> 4795.44
like

4793.44 --> 4798.48
yeah what do you call it actually

4795.44 --> 4801.759999999999
fertile seeds

4798.48 --> 4804.4
right they are there it's just

4801.76 --> 4807.92
the growers kind of like to keep them to

4804.4 --> 4807.92
themselves you see

4808.96 --> 4813.199
and if they're going to make business of

4810.8 --> 4815.92
selling seeds

4813.199 --> 4819.599999999999
well then unless they're specifically

4815.92 --> 4821.6
advertised as these deliver plants that

4819.6 --> 4823.360000000001
can procreate that can give you more

4821.6 --> 4826.639
seeds unless it's specifically

4823.36 --> 4831.12
advertised as that there's a good chance

4826.639 --> 4831.12
they're not gonna deliver fertile plants

4831.28 --> 4835.36
because yeah

4833.52 --> 4838.320000000001
if it's a company that sells seeds

4835.36 --> 4840.719
they're gonna want you to buy more seeds

4838.32 --> 4842.719
so why give you then a fertile plant

4840.719 --> 4844.8
that can make its own seeds because that

4842.719 --> 4847.84
just gonna make you run out of business

4844.8 --> 4847.84
very quickly right

4848.32 --> 4851.36
heirloom that's right

4851.6 --> 4855.84
so yeah you got to watch out for that if

4853.28 --> 4858.96
you want to get your own seeds that can

4855.84 --> 4860.8
that you can turn into your own plants

4858.96 --> 4862.56
with seeds

4860.8 --> 4863.92
so you can keep going with your own

4862.56 --> 4865.84
seeds yeah you're going to have to get

4863.92 --> 4868.639
the the heirloom

4865.84 --> 4871.12
and non-hybrid type of seeds

4868.639 --> 4874.719
you gotta watch out for that that's not

4871.12 --> 4878.719
standard it not all seeds are like that

4874.719 --> 4878.719
and they are going to be more expensive

4883.36 --> 4886.36
what

4897.199 --> 4901.48
smoking dope is a sin

4902.08 --> 4905.04
not per default

4905.52 --> 4910.639
i mean

4907.12 --> 4915.48
arguably according to the rastafari

4910.639 --> 4915.4800000000005
religion it is actually the opposite

4916.639 --> 4923.76
it's a god's herb

4919.679 --> 4926.0
but yeah like any substance you can end

4923.76 --> 4929.4400000000005
up abusing it using

4926.0 --> 4931.36
it for escapism purposes which means not

4929.44 --> 4933.28
confronting something about your life

4931.36 --> 4936.159
that you should

4933.28 --> 4937.84
now that would be a sin right escapism

4936.159 --> 4939.92
is the sin

4937.84 --> 4943.88
not the substance

4939.92 --> 4943.88
how you use it

4948.0 --> 4953.199
guest gadget inspector

4951.199 --> 4956.5599999999995
cannabis sweets are kind of useless but

4953.199 --> 4956.5599999999995
hash cake yeah that's

4957.36 --> 4963.36
i don't like it

4959.28 --> 4963.36
because it's extremely unpredictable

4964.32 --> 4969.599999999999
you can get like really sick of it

4967.36 --> 4971.04
because you can't you can't create the

4969.6 --> 4972.96
dosage right

4971.04 --> 4975.44
when you're spoken you can be like the

4972.96 --> 4976.32
first sip it's like oh [ __ ] this is

4975.44 --> 4977.5199999999995
strong

4976.32 --> 4979.92
okay

4977.52 --> 4981.84
i'm gonna be off right yeah you can you

4979.92 --> 4984.4
could literally test it in a moment like

4981.84 --> 4987.4400000000005
oh this is too strong no more right well

4984.4 --> 4988.5599999999995
if you eat it pot brownie or a hash cake

4987.44 --> 4990.159
you're like

4988.56 --> 4991.360000000001
well this tastes really good i'm gonna

4990.159 --> 4993.839999999999
eat it

4991.36 --> 4995.12
and then later you feel you don't get

4993.84 --> 4997.1990000000005
that moment

4995.12 --> 4999.199
where you could check like oh [ __ ] maybe

4997.199 --> 5001.759999999999
this is too strong oh no it's too late

4999.199 --> 5003.919999999999
you already ate it

5001.76 --> 5006.400000000001
i don't really like those

5003.92 --> 5009.4
i don't like that delivery system

5006.4 --> 5009.4
really

5014.239 --> 5021.599999999999
god this is such a drug show now

5017.28 --> 5021.599999999999
i didn't really mean that to happen

5022.639 --> 5026.719
i'm gonna blame gadget inspector and

5024.88 --> 5030.639
bringing on the vodka in the middle of

5026.719 --> 5034.4800000000005
the afternoon it's all your fault dude

5030.639 --> 5034.4800000000005
your irish french ways

5039.04 --> 5044.8
yeah that's really nice hill to the chef

5041.84 --> 5047.4400000000005
yeah how about i just don't use it

5044.8 --> 5050.2390000000005
because i don't want to use that

5047.44 --> 5050.239
how about that

5051.84 --> 5056.2390000000005
how about i just

5053.679 --> 5058.639
roll a joint when i feel like it and

5056.239 --> 5060.08
smoke it so i can immediately feel if it

5058.639 --> 5061.52
falls

5060.08 --> 5064.159
well or not

5061.52 --> 5064.159000000001
how about that

5066.0 --> 5068.84
that's right we all have our own

5067.28 --> 5070.88
preferences if you

5068.84 --> 5072.400000000001
like cake or whatever

5070.88 --> 5074.719
go ahead

5072.4 --> 5077.679
your life

5074.719 --> 5077.679
that's what you like

5083.12 --> 5088.92
if you don't like inhaling carcinogens

5085.12 --> 5088.92
so good luck with that

5103.12 --> 5106.32
did you know then this is kind of silly

5105.52 --> 5109.120000000001
that

5106.32 --> 5112.32
tobacco actually

5109.12 --> 5114.0
helps you disinfect your lungs you don't

5112.32 --> 5116.5599999999995
overdo it

5114.0 --> 5119.52
and again it's really the raw tobacco

5116.56 --> 5122.719
not the standard [ __ ] with all this

5119.52 --> 5124.84
all the additives that doesn't help

5122.719 --> 5128.4800000000005
it's actually disinfectant even in

5124.84 --> 5131.679
nature it's recognized

5128.48 --> 5131.678999999999
as a disinfectant

5132.4 --> 5137.28
an anti-parasite especially the

5134.639 --> 5139.28
anti-parasite part right because

5137.28 --> 5140.4
yeah you actually breathe in a lot of

5139.28 --> 5142.8
stuff

5140.4 --> 5145.5199999999995
including microorganisms and potential

5142.8 --> 5145.52
parasites

5146.8 --> 5152.96
smoking tobacco is good for you

5150.56 --> 5157.1990000000005
i've tried to tell it

5152.96 --> 5159.76
it two two days ago on the sunday show

5157.199 --> 5162.239
it's actually good for you

5159.76 --> 5165.4400000000005
you don't get cancer

5162.239 --> 5168.08
from smoking tobacco

5165.44 --> 5172.48
you get it from all the additives that

5168.08 --> 5176.0
big tobacco industry put into it

5172.48 --> 5177.04
during the eugenics futurism development

5176.0 --> 5179.52
age

5177.04 --> 5180.4
yeah oh look all these people got cancer

5179.52 --> 5182.639
oh

5180.4 --> 5184.48
oh no it's not a tobacco oh we're gonna

5182.639 --> 5186.400000000001
throw giant amounts of money just to

5184.48 --> 5189.599999999999
argue it's not the tobacco even though

5186.4 --> 5190.48
it's blatantly empirically obvious that

5189.6 --> 5193.52
their

5190.48 --> 5196.5199999999995
cigarettes and [ __ ] are causing that

5193.52 --> 5196.52
statistically

5196.719 --> 5202.88
it wasn't the tobacco because people

5198.88 --> 5207.679
been smoking tobacco on a large scale

5202.88 --> 5208.88
for 200 years before that and didn't get

5207.679 --> 5212.4800000000005
it

5208.88 --> 5215.36
yeah because you don't get cancer from

5212.48 --> 5219.04
raw tobacco

5215.36 --> 5223.04
you don't it's a medicinal herb

5219.04 --> 5225.84
it's actually disinfectant

5223.04 --> 5227.679
is good

5225.84 --> 5229.84
as long as you don't over smoke if you

5227.679 --> 5233.04
don't constantly smell filled with smoke

5229.84 --> 5236.159000000001
yeah it is eventually gonna just

5233.04 --> 5238.0
well smoke you like a like a herring

5236.159 --> 5241.04
right you're gonna get smoked if you

5238.0 --> 5243.84
smoke too much it's not bad for you

5241.04 --> 5244.96
it's actually not bad for you it's all a

5243.84 --> 5248.08
ruse

5244.96 --> 5250.4
big tobacco ruined it for you

5248.08 --> 5254.8
it was the oligarchy

5250.4 --> 5258.239
that made this fear of tobacco and oh

5254.8 --> 5261.28
tobacco is the cause of cancer

5258.239 --> 5264.5599999999995
no it wasn't you filthy industrialist

5261.28 --> 5267.28
satanic pieces of [ __ ] it isn't you've

5264.56 --> 5271.120000000001
been lied to

5267.28 --> 5276.28
it's the additives it is purely the

5297.76 --> 5301.92
real cancer

5299.76 --> 5304.159000000001
and the real disease and the atrophy you

5301.92 --> 5307.04
know yeah it is the carcinogens it's the

5304.159 --> 5310.48
other [ __ ] the additives

5307.04 --> 5312.08
that they put into the tobacco

5310.48 --> 5314.0
in cigarettes

5312.08 --> 5316.0
and in pouches

5314.0 --> 5318.48
check

5316.0 --> 5319.52
that's what does that yeah

5318.48 --> 5322.959999999999
no

5319.52 --> 5326.0
smoke if you burn woods and you inhale

5322.96 --> 5328.8
the smoke oh it's a carcinogen blah blah

5326.0 --> 5330.159
blah really nice yeah people been

5328.8 --> 5334.639
smoking

5330.159 --> 5336.4
originally grown raw tobacco for 250

5334.639 --> 5339.52
years

5336.4 --> 5343.04
or something like that maybe 300

5339.52 --> 5348.0
then in the 20th century big tobacco

5343.04 --> 5349.199
started to put crap into their products

5348.0 --> 5351.04
right

5349.199 --> 5353.839999999999
and then make everybody have that

standardized modernize it yeah oh and

5353.84 --> 5360.88
people getting lung cancer everywhere oh

5357.04 --> 5364.08
yes yes but not the 200 years before

5360.88 --> 5366.56
that when everybody was also then

5364.08 --> 5370.5599999999995
smoking tobacco

5366.56 --> 5374.320000000001
it's all a ruse it's a lie

5370.56 --> 5377.6
tobacco doesn't give you cancer it's the

5639.92 --> 5644.4
parasites

5642.08 --> 5646.4
right just your nose hairs and all that

5644.4 --> 5650.12
are not going to prevent some of that

5646.4 --> 5650.12
from slipping through

5671.76 --> 5675.360000000001
okay hill to the chef

5679.36 --> 5687.839999999999
that's all super cool

5682.639 --> 5687.84
tobacco is not bad for you

5721.92 --> 5726.2390000000005
hmm

5724.239 --> 5729.839999999999
oh wow up to the chef so it was even

5726.239 --> 5729.839999999999
earlier there that's interesting

5738.8 --> 5741.360000000001
interesting

5741.679 --> 5743.84
right

5742.56 --> 5746.56
anyway

5743.84 --> 5748.400000000001
time has flown

5746.56 --> 5750.8
talking about

5748.4 --> 5753.92
drugs

5750.8 --> 5755.6
yeah but seriously tobacco not bad

5753.92 --> 5758.719
tobacco good

5755.6 --> 5761.6
just don't buy the standard

5758.719 --> 5763.76
big tobacco crap

5761.6 --> 5767.119000000001
grow your own or

5763.76 --> 5769.04
have a grower send you dried leaves and

5767.119 --> 5770.4
cut your own

5769.04 --> 5772.719
it's good

5770.4 --> 5775.5199999999995
don't over smoke it of course but it is

5772.719 --> 5777.44
so much better it's not gonna hurt you

5775.52 --> 5778.88
it's not gonna be painful there's the

5777.44 --> 5780.48
additives

5778.88 --> 5783.92
are added

5780.48 --> 5786.638999999999
they're added to the typical tobacco

5783.92 --> 5788.88
it's in there i feel it's in there i'm

5786.639 --> 5792.56
really sad about it i wish that they

5788.88 --> 5795.6
just completely stopped doing that

5792.56 --> 5799.679
or that big tobacco could be replaced by

5795.6 --> 5800.8
a new modern big tobacco that would

5799.679 --> 5802.159
literally

5800.8 --> 5804.400000000001
honor

5802.159 --> 5806.32
the tobacco plant and say like yeah

5804.4 --> 5807.5199999999995
we're just not gonna do additives

5806.32 --> 5809.5199999999995
anymore

5807.52 --> 5812.639
we're gonna clean up this [ __ ] and we're

5809.52 --> 5815.4400000000005
gonna sue big tobacco and how they

5812.639 --> 5818.4800000000005
destroyed the reputation of the tobacco

5815.44 --> 5819.28
plant we're going to sue them

5818.48 --> 5822.32

5822.32 --> 5827.5199999999995
