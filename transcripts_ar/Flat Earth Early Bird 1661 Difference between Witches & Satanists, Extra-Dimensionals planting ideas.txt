89.64 --> 96.14
guys right anyway

93.119 --> 96.14
where today

96.36 --> 101.579
it's cleared up a bit

98.04 --> 103.97900000000001
and it's become much windier

101.579 --> 108.36
but like yeah the air is kind of like

103.979 --> 108.36
nice and warm warmish

109.92 --> 114.299
it's like a bit of a dreamy day this is

112.38 --> 115.259
one of those days people are gonna be

114.299 --> 118.57900000000001
like

115.259 --> 118.579
very distracted

119.52 --> 123.14
because it just feels like that

123.479 --> 129.119
right plants are doing great

125.939 --> 132.0
I just I'm just loving these basil

129.119 --> 133.62
plants I'm hanging them out

132.0 --> 135.06
to prevent them from blowing over

133.62 --> 136.44
continually

135.06 --> 140.16
but

136.44 --> 142.56
like they attract bees continually

140.16 --> 146.76
it's amazing

142.56 --> 151.04
like bees come over here just to sit on

146.76 --> 151.04
on those flowers and it's just like yes

152.819 --> 157.26
like I found another purpose for them

155.16 --> 160.28
other than just eating and looking at

157.26 --> 160.28
them for being pretty

162.26 --> 166.56
great

163.86 --> 169.019
I didn't know like basil flowers even

166.56 --> 171.44
attracted bees damage but apparently

169.019 --> 171.44
they do

172.17 --> 176.57999999999998
[Music]

173.879 --> 176.85999999999999
hello Cleary first in chat good to see

176.58 --> 179.929
you

176.86 --> 179.929
[Music]

179.94 --> 186.12
it is Saturday the 15th of July 2023

187.319 --> 192.26
uh

189.12 --> 192.26
feeling pretty good today

193.86 --> 196.53
even though I watched a shitty movie

195.72 --> 199.60999999999999
yesterday

196.53 --> 199.61
[Music]

200.159 --> 202.879
uh

209.58 --> 212.3
it's like

215.159 --> 220.379
there's nothing worse than like a

218.099 --> 224.33999999999997
mystery sci-fi movie

220.379 --> 225.84
where the end plot turns out to be

224.34 --> 230.159
like

225.84 --> 233.64000000000001
stupid mainstream liberal narrative like

230.159 --> 235.67999999999998
oh white supremacist terrorists

233.64 --> 237.659
and like

235.68 --> 240.18
you're like holding on the entire movie

237.659 --> 242.28
to be like oh we'll figure this out like

240.18 --> 244.26000000000002
this is an interesting mystery it's kind

242.28 --> 246.12
of like yeah

244.26 --> 248.94
it's okay and then at the end it's like

246.12 --> 253.34
oh yeah here's why it all happened

248.94 --> 253.34
like [ __ ] you

254.099 --> 259.919
it's like the first time I've ever given

256.5 --> 262.139
a movie that sucked a thumbs down

259.919 --> 264.78
normally I just kind of ignored this was

262.139 --> 269.90000000000003
like [ __ ] you

264.78 --> 273.05999999999995
that was like the most annoying [ __ ]

269.9 --> 276.06
plot ever

273.06 --> 276.06
ah

277.16 --> 281.759
anyway

278.9 --> 283.73999999999995
I don't even remember the name and it's

281.759 --> 286.639
on Netflix so I'm probably not gonna

283.74 --> 286.639
find it back either

286.86 --> 293.639
anyway hello Cleary

289.5 --> 296.84
the USS Callister oh okay I I never

293.639 --> 296.84000000000003
watched the Black Mirror

300.259 --> 305.16
it's like

302.66 --> 306.68
not a good influence from what I

305.16 --> 310.58000000000004
understand

306.68 --> 310.58
it's great okay

311.4 --> 316.85999999999996
I mean it's just like the stupid Lucifer

314.04 --> 318.78000000000003
series continually getting pushed in my

316.86 --> 320.52000000000004
face and people say like oh but it's

318.78 --> 321.35999999999996
okay it's kind of a comedy yeah yeah

320.52 --> 323.82
that's

321.36 --> 325.62
that's exactly why I don't want to watch

323.82 --> 327.84
that

325.62 --> 329.52
like those are the worst

327.84 --> 331.979
they're the ones that are making you

329.52 --> 333.35999999999996
associate Lucifer with oh maybe it's not

331.979 --> 334.62
that bad

333.36 --> 337.08000000000004
it's like

334.62 --> 338.88
I'm not falling for that [ __ ] I'm just

337.08 --> 345.959
never gonna watch that

338.88 --> 345.959
[Music]

352.56 --> 356.78000000000003
anyway hey flatter stage good to see you

358.02 --> 362.78
like there's a lot of things on Netflix

359.699 --> 362.78000000000003
I'm never gonna watch

366.96 --> 371.75899999999996
and unlike most people I actually never

369.9 --> 373.4
do

371.759 --> 377.06
it's just

373.4 --> 378.84
and it feels great

377.06 --> 382.139
foreign

378.84 --> 385.58
I don't need to know how far

382.139 --> 385.58
people have sunk

385.74 --> 391.199
like that I just I don't want to make it

388.68 --> 394.319
rub off on me I don't want to

391.199 --> 396.91900000000004
let it add to normalization of the

394.319 --> 396.91900000000004
atrocities

398.52 --> 400.94
right

401.1 --> 407.52000000000004
talking about which

402.96 --> 409.5
sound of Freedom like dude this

407.52 --> 411.9
it's all

409.5 --> 413.4
kind of messed up you know been

411.9 --> 416.69899999999996
following our own Benjamin he's really

413.4 --> 419.4
been rolling out

416.699 --> 422.28000000000003
the research about it and it's like oh

419.4 --> 423.78
my God this is like a massive massive

422.28 --> 426.78
gravel

423.78 --> 426.78
unbelievable

427.08 --> 433.85999999999996
and it even like even uh Greg Reese from

430.44 --> 436.62
Infowars team he even caught on to it

433.86 --> 439.319
I mean that guy's assure a cookie and a

436.62 --> 441.539
flat Earth or even apparently

439.319 --> 444.24
he doesn't talk about it all the time

441.539 --> 446.039
but he like he made a video and that

444.24 --> 450.38
kind of shocked the rest of the info

446.039 --> 450.38
wars team that and that's just amazing

450.419 --> 457.08
so but I mean Owen Owen got there first

454.139 --> 459.18
man on this one he definitely did

457.08 --> 462.35999999999996
for me too it was like out of nowhere

459.18 --> 466.039
like what what's so bad about this oh

462.36 --> 466.039
oh what the [ __ ]

473.58 --> 476.419
times and what

476.58 --> 481.56
pretty gay yeah no [ __ ]

479.639 --> 484.86
flatter Sage

481.56 --> 489.0
but to be fair if you just don't [ __ ]

484.86 --> 491.819
click them to see how gay they are

489.0 --> 494.099
then you get less gay [ __ ] shoved in

491.819 --> 496.319
your face

494.099 --> 499.139
it actually there's like this continual

496.319 --> 501.66
algorithm going with like this giant

499.139 --> 504.96000000000004
list of suggestions and if you just

501.66 --> 506.46000000000004
don't click things that look like they

504.96 --> 509.81899999999996
could be gay

506.46 --> 511.19899999999996
then they stop shoving gay [ __ ] in your

509.819 --> 514.76
face

511.199 --> 514.76
so that's just a tip there

516.24 --> 520.62
and it's a universal tip and that's even

518.459 --> 523.64
a tip in the face of the sound of

520.62 --> 523.64
Freedom it's like hey

523.8 --> 529.74
you you think that's a good idea to

526.38 --> 532.26
start to like watch that

529.74 --> 535.26
or get closer to that I mean you know

532.26 --> 538.38
what the algorithm does don't you and

535.26 --> 540.36
like it's not gonna have that

538.38 --> 542.399
perspective

540.36 --> 543.9590000000001
it's just like oh you're exposing

542.399 --> 546.899
yourself to this okay then I guess

543.959 --> 551.2399999999999
you're okay with all this you know so

546.899 --> 551.24
just just don't do that

552.24 --> 555.32
be careful

555.6 --> 558.14

I'm not amused by this yet I don't think

1149.48 --> 1156.98
gay is funny yeah I don't think it is

1153.14 --> 1158.7800000000002
funny to play pretended

1156.98 --> 1161.44
unless you're like in the middle of a

1158.78 --> 1161.44
rant or something

1161.78 --> 1166.7
I don't think it's funny yeah

1164.299 --> 1169.82
I'm not homophobic because of some

1166.7 --> 1172.94
[ __ ] political position to get some

1169.82 --> 1175.4189999999999
traction with the guys no I'm actually

1172.94 --> 1178.039
[ __ ] homophobic and not in a

1175.419 --> 1182.2990000000002
terrified way

1184.88 --> 1188.8600000000001
keep it to yourselves that's real

1190.1 --> 1199.8999999999999
yeah if you happen to be gay well please

1193.64 --> 1199.9
don't let me know and suppress it

1200.419 --> 1205.7
because if I find out that you are if

1203.419 --> 1210.1000000000001
you're somehow gonna let it slip through

1205.7 --> 1210.1000000000001
like that's gonna leave a permanent mark

1217.22 --> 1221.179
can cure gayness does that make you a

1219.799 --> 1224.26
sex or cyst

1221.179 --> 1224.26
okay that's kind of funny

1226.28 --> 1229.12
hello LSP

1232.46 --> 1239.32
all right well

1234.559 --> 1239.32
I see it as it's a demonic influence

1240.08 --> 1245.1789999999999
and if you accept it and you allow it

1242.96 --> 1248.799
for whatever reason even from an

1245.179 --> 1248.799
innocent whoa what the hell

1249.14 --> 1254.6200000000001
the hell that's the most curious looking

1251.12 --> 1254.62
Cloud I've ever seen

1256.76 --> 1261.86
sorry for being so distracted I mean it

1259.58 --> 1263.96
don't particularly like talking about

1261.86 --> 1266.86
gay [ __ ]

1263.96 --> 1266.8600000000001
look at that

1270.74 --> 1274.9
I see it

1272.299 --> 1274.9
okay

1276.7 --> 1285.02
come on why is it over saturated damn it

1282.26 --> 1288.28
it's Overexposed

1285.02 --> 1288.28
because there's like this

1288.679 --> 1293.74
web it's like a web of clouds out there

1293.96 --> 1297.94
it's almost like a sand pattern

1298.539 --> 1303.919
I've never seen it like this with this

1301.4 --> 1306.039
Crystal Blue on the background and it's

1303.919 --> 1309.44
like much higher than those

1306.039 --> 1312.32
regular sized clouds there

1309.44 --> 1314.919
where you can see it from here

1312.32 --> 1314.9189999999999
yeah

1317.059 --> 1321.02
it's just

1318.2 --> 1323.24
so odd

1321.02 --> 1325.58
this part is Overexposed it's the most

1323.24 --> 1328.96
is there it's very oh wait

1325.58 --> 1328.96
okay you can see it a bit now

1330.86 --> 1335.74
like above

1333.2 --> 1338.659
the bigger Cloud there's like this web

1335.74 --> 1340.34
of little fluffy but it's not cheap

1338.659 --> 1342.5200000000002
clouds they're not shaped like that it's

1340.34 --> 1345.9189999999999
a very weird side

1342.52 --> 1348.34
it's like this web

1345.919 --> 1352.7
but not like a chemtrail web or anything

1348.34 --> 1356.86
it's not like a feather anyway weird

1352.7 --> 1356.8600000000001
hey Mark Collard could see you

1360.14 --> 1365.26
and see me Traveler

1362.48 --> 1365.26
to see you

1395.36 --> 1397.4189999999999
okay

1402.14 --> 1406.9
okay yeah you're not gonna trigger

1404.539 --> 1406.9
anyone

1407.96 --> 1411.919
um

1409.64 --> 1416.179
what we won

1411.919 --> 1419.8400000000001
is the argumentation that's what we want

1416.179 --> 1422.1200000000001
we won the argument we know

1419.84 --> 1424.48
through empiricism that the Earth is

1422.12 --> 1424.4799999999998
flat

1429.559 --> 1435.86
and through the extrapolation of

1432.559 --> 1439.1589999999999
literally all data is available right

1435.86 --> 1443.6589999999999
the arguments have progressed to like

1439.159 --> 1445.5200000000002
an irreversible absolute point

1443.659 --> 1448.0390000000002
like there's nothing

1445.52 --> 1451.4
Ballers could ever do at this point to

1448.039 --> 1455.02
ever be able to somehow win the argument

1451.4 --> 1455.02
like it's not possible anymore

1455.179 --> 1461.679
you can just delude yourself all day

1457.4 --> 1461.679
long which is what you do

1461.84 --> 1467.24
but yeah we have won the argument

1465.32 --> 1471.76
and there's absolutely no way back

1467.24 --> 1471.76
there's nothing you could ever conceive

1473.24 --> 1477.64
to alter

1474.679 --> 1477.64
the situation

1479.059 --> 1483.32
if I won the argument wise to argue well

1481.1 --> 1486.8799999999999
I'm not arguing about it do you see me

1483.32 --> 1486.8799999999999
arguing about it on my show

1487.88 --> 1492.7
you brought it up

1489.799 --> 1492.7
did I

1495.679 --> 1500.659
I mean

1497.78 --> 1503.299
a flat Earth doesn't even come up that

1500.659 --> 1505.159
much anymore on my show unless there's

1503.299 --> 1507.02
like a newcomer that's just genuinely

1505.159 --> 1509.0590000000002
asking a question about like hey what

1507.02 --> 1512.12
about

1509.059 --> 1515.8999999999999
your conception of the Flat Earth

1512.12 --> 1518.6589999999999
right or what do you think about this

1515.9 --> 1520.46
that's when it comes out when newcomers

1518.659 --> 1523.3400000000001
ask me

1520.46 --> 1525.919
because among one another here the

1523.34 --> 1528.74
people that come regularly like we

1525.919 --> 1530.6000000000001
there's nothing left really to say

1528.74 --> 1533.48
did that kind of just point at

1530.6 --> 1537.26
anti-flatter flat earthers and just

1533.48 --> 1541.22
study their double thing

1537.26 --> 1543.98
right that's kind of what's left

1541.22 --> 1546.58
the new confessional debating tactics

1543.98 --> 1546.58
and all that

1547.94 --> 1552.2
because

1549.38 --> 1554.98
the ACT argue actual arguments like the

1552.2 --> 1554.98
actual proof

1555.14 --> 1560.2990000000002
how maps are created our Celestial

1557.72 --> 1563.779
navigation works it's it's just over

1560.299 --> 1567.86
it's over there's nothing left for you

1563.779 --> 1570.88
nothing left for the globe but fantasy

1567.86 --> 1570.8799999999999
and tenacity

1581.299 --> 1586.8799999999999
and I know of course on other channels

1584.419 --> 1589.7
flat earthers will be arguing and of

1586.88 --> 1592.2990000000002
course on the flatters debates

1589.7 --> 1592.299
but

1597.26 --> 1601.94
it's kind of just at the Flat Earth

1599.72 --> 1605.799
debates it's kind of weird just nerds

1601.94 --> 1605.799
being perfectionists at this point

1610.0 --> 1613.24
that's it

1626.779 --> 1629.26
hmm

1630.2 --> 1633.3400000000001
right by the way

1639.62 --> 1644.86
I think it was slow-mo moon buggy

1641.659 --> 1644.8600000000001
yesterday that sent me a video

1645.14 --> 1651.88
in the chat I checked that out

1648.44 --> 1651.88
or at least a big part of it

1652.34 --> 1656.12
was about some

1654.2 --> 1658.4
I think doctors

1656.12 --> 1662.3799999999999
talking about

1658.4 --> 1662.38
malaria and all that sort of thing

1663.5 --> 1667.059
that was pretty surprising

1673.4 --> 1677.9
and I'd like to cross-reference it some

1676.279 --> 1679.159
more with

1677.9 --> 1681.5
other

1679.159 --> 1684.74
people that are like into terrain Theory

1681.5 --> 1687.679
and all that that well according to that

1684.74 --> 1692.02
the people in that video like malaria is

1687.679 --> 1692.02
literally not it's not even a thing

1693.44 --> 1696.7
it's more like an

1699.14 --> 1705.74
it's a reaction to just the top the this

1702.799 --> 1707.4189999999999
acidic influence of the mosquito bites

1705.74 --> 1710.779
if you get a lot of them

1707.419 --> 1713.9
then your body like

1710.779 --> 1716.679
needs to process that stuff and that can

1713.9 --> 1716.679
cause a fever

1717.26 --> 1722.179
and comes a little late

1719.6 --> 1724.2199999999998
for some reason and that's what is

1722.179 --> 1728.6000000000001
associated with malaria

1724.22 --> 1731.0
but it always just goes away again

1728.6 --> 1733.8799999999999
unless you keep getting massively bitten

1731.0 --> 1736.76
by mosquitoes all the time

1733.88 --> 1738.7990000000002
so that's what I got from that very

1736.76 --> 1742.6589999999999
surprising

1738.799 --> 1742.6589999999999
I really thought it was a real thing

1744.14 --> 1747.98
so

1745.46 --> 1750.32
I'm not entirely sure just yet but I

1747.98 --> 1753.039
mean that that was like a bit of a

1750.32 --> 1753.039
like what

1757.279 --> 1761.299
the doctor Cohen's it could be I don't

1760.1 --> 1763.6399999999999
remember the name

1761.299 --> 1765.559
but slo-mo moon buggy posted that

1763.64 --> 1768.22
yesterday here were you was that you

1765.559 --> 1768.22
slo-mo

1768.26 --> 1774.46
yeah Dr Koh Infinity yeah right

1771.32 --> 1774.46
I would dig it well

1775.399 --> 1779.9599999999998
it wasn't super riveting to listen to

1777.799 --> 1782.96
but

1779.96 --> 1787.52
it did surprise me here and there

1782.96 --> 1790.94
and I'd like to hear other people also

1787.52 --> 1793.6399999999999
basically get into that

1790.94 --> 1795.559
because I'm not entirely sure about the

1793.64 --> 1798.26
I don't know it's just the first time

1795.559 --> 1800.9189999999999
I've heard of it I

1798.26 --> 1800.919
I don't know

1810.16 --> 1813.41
[Music]

1815.779 --> 1822.86
I'm still also they didn't address every

1820.22 --> 1825.08
detail

1822.86 --> 1828.6789999999999
you see they just said no it's made up

1825.08 --> 1830.96
but I still remember that

1828.679 --> 1833.24
like was it then also made up that you

1830.96 --> 1835.58
have specific malaria mosquitoes and

1833.24 --> 1839.059
that have a certain type of

1835.58 --> 1841.039
like they have their head different than

1839.059 --> 1842.84
regular like that was a whole thing it's

1841.039 --> 1845.24
like no malaria mosquitoes look slightly

1842.84 --> 1846.3799999999999
different was that completely made up

1845.24 --> 1848.0
too

1846.38 --> 1850.8200000000002
like

1848.0 --> 1852.38
they never addressed that

1850.82 --> 1854.48
I think

1852.38 --> 1856.5200000000002
I didn't actually watch the entire thing

1854.48 --> 1859.039
well did they ever address that slow-mo

1856.52 --> 1862.96
you you probably watched the whole thing

1859.039 --> 1862.96
some of the other you other guys

1863.899 --> 1869.6789999999999
because he didn't address any of that at

1866.6 --> 1869.6789999999999
least in the first half hour

1880.399 --> 1886.6999999999998
they addressed yeah that's what I

1882.559 --> 1888.82
thought so that makes it a little like

1886.7 --> 1888.82
um

1890.539 --> 1895.58
it's like it's not complete so I I

1893.24 --> 1897.919
really wonder is this

1895.58 --> 1900.9189999999999
is this like a

1897.919 --> 1903.8600000000001
an estimation or is this like something

1900.919 --> 1905.8990000000001
that is generally concluded among

1903.86 --> 1909.6789999999999
holistic

1905.899 --> 1912.76
terrain oriented doctors

1909.679 --> 1912.76
I want to know more

1929.059 --> 1932.059
foreign

1943.539 --> 1951.34
people well maybe it just kind of broke

1947.659 --> 1951.3400000000001
I just want to know more about it

1952.52 --> 1957.62
because

1954.679 --> 1961.0590000000002
it would be a good thing to know more

1957.62 --> 1961.059
about what it really is

1963.2 --> 1969.6200000000001
I mean as far as I remember on record

1966.14 --> 1972.14
people have even died from malaria

1969.62 --> 1974.0
so does that mean that they're like in

1972.14 --> 1976.8200000000002
an unhealthy State and they just get

1974.0 --> 1979.399
completely sucked by my mosquitoes

1976.82 --> 1981.62
that so badly that they just die from

1979.399 --> 1984.5
the toxic shock of it

1981.62 --> 1987.86
like what are those deaths then I kind

1984.5 --> 1990.62
of need to know you see

1987.86 --> 1992.799
I'm I'm take I'm not just gonna look uh

1990.62 --> 1998.1399999999999
I knew it another thing that's just fake

1992.799 --> 1998.1399999999999
just like that no no I want to be sure

1999.019 --> 2001.86
with this

2003.88 --> 2008.7990000000002
I'm not like a

2005.74 --> 2012.539
overly eager solipsist that's just ready

2008.799 --> 2012.539
to chug everything down the bin

2014.38 --> 2016.98
you know

2018.58 --> 2022.1999999999998
I kind of want to make sure

2025.179 --> 2032.919
but here's the thing if it's fake

2029.74 --> 2034.8990000000001
that would kind of explain

2032.919 --> 2038.2
and this is this is going to be a crazy

2034.899 --> 2040.6
one if it's completely fake malaria if

2038.2 --> 2043.059
it's like another myth

2040.6 --> 2046.0
medical myth to scare us for the medical

2043.059 --> 2047.9189999999999
industrial complex right well that would

2046.0 --> 2050.44
kind of explain that scene where Bill

2047.919 --> 2052.06
Gates literally releases malaria

2050.44 --> 2054.879
mosquitoes

2052.06 --> 2058.179
in the audience

2054.879 --> 2062.56
and everybody laughs about it

2058.179 --> 2065.919
yeah because as an alternative to oh

2062.56 --> 2068.619
they're also for all the population oh

2065.919 --> 2069.8199999999997
yes or instead of like squirting for

2068.619 --> 2071.9190000000003
death

2069.82 --> 2073.8990000000003
it could be that they're kind of

2071.919 --> 2077.0989999999997
laughing because they actually are

2073.899 --> 2077.0989999999997
informed that it's fake

2080.619 --> 2083.82
you never thought of that

2084.879 --> 2086.879
um

2102.06 --> 2107.44
that's my Valeria recently well that's

2105.22 --> 2109.839
the thing Richard G it could medical

2107.44 --> 2113.079
industrial complex is notorious for like

2109.839 --> 2116.94
spotting a disease and then basically

2113.079 --> 2116.94
killing them with their remedy

2117.64 --> 2124.72
like what happened with the whole AIDS

2120.72 --> 2127.24
situations right

2124.72 --> 2129.3999999999996
so it could be that that's with malaria

2127.24 --> 2131.74
as well sort of

2129.4 --> 2135.1600000000003
but it could also be that I don't know

2131.74 --> 2138.16
toxic shock from massive mosquito biting

2135.16 --> 2140.92
right not a disease but just a talk

2138.16 --> 2143.5
basically getting poisoned to death

2140.92 --> 2146.56
so I want to know

2143.5 --> 2148.119
is it real or is it an event of disease

2146.56 --> 2151.42
and you believe in it and then they

2148.119 --> 2153.4
basically get you killed

2151.42 --> 2155.26
right it might be part of like a

2153.4 --> 2157.96
Eugenics operation like that because

2155.26 --> 2160.0600000000004
it's mostly in Africa I think

2157.96 --> 2162.04
or South America I don't know in

2160.06 --> 2165.52
tropical regions

2162.04 --> 2167.079
and so then they might use that

2165.52 --> 2169.3
as a trick

2167.079 --> 2171.579
to kill people off I mean it's the

2169.3 --> 2175.3
medical industrial complex they are like

2171.579 --> 2179.2000000000003
the Eugenics operation pretty much

2175.3 --> 2183.0
have been since the early 2000s or the

2179.2 --> 2183.0
early 20th century

2184.96 --> 2188.7
so it could be that

2193.24 --> 2196.9199999999996
or yeah or

2199.839 --> 2204.099
yeah a combination I mean if people are

2202.48 --> 2206.2
really unhealthy they don't eat right

2204.099 --> 2209.2000000000003
they're not in hygienic circumstances

2206.2 --> 2211.48
which is they're very typical in Africa

2209.2 --> 2214.2999999999997
and then you get a toxic shock from

2211.48 --> 2217.18
massive mosquito bites well

2214.3 --> 2220.54
yeah that could make that could be fatal

2217.18 --> 2223.72
you know but I mean

2220.54 --> 2228.4
stubbing your toe in the jungle can also

2223.72 --> 2230.74
be fatal I'm not even joking

2228.4 --> 2234.099
to get like an open wound and you don't

2230.74 --> 2236.2
take care of it really quickly yeah I

2234.099 --> 2238.44
mean you get infected and you [ __ ]

2236.2 --> 2238.4399999999996
die

2240.7 --> 2246.64
like that does happen there

2243.88 --> 2248.38
whatever like oh what's doing that I

2246.64 --> 2249.8199999999997
don't know what's doing it

2248.38 --> 2254.44
but

2249.82 --> 2258.28
yeah I mean if you scrape your knee in

2254.44 --> 2260.5
the forest hair it's like yeah you you

2258.28 --> 2261.46
probably wanted this infected but that's

2260.5 --> 2263.859
fine

2261.46 --> 2267.16
if you do that like in the jungle of

2263.859 --> 2269.5
Africa somewhere like dude

2267.16 --> 2271.92
everybody knows you get wounded you got

2269.5 --> 2271.92
a problem

2273.16 --> 2278.98
like getting wounded there is literally

2276.76 --> 2283.0200000000004
potentially lethal

2278.98 --> 2283.02
even if it's just minor

2284.5 --> 2289.48
so

2286.0 --> 2291.579
I don't know you see see things are kind

2289.48 --> 2295.68
of complicated like that is is anything

2291.579 --> 2295.6800000000003
about malaria real was it all set up

2296.14 --> 2301.66
was it another Eugenics operation

2298.839 --> 2303.16
or is it

2301.66 --> 2307.0
like a

2303.16 --> 2309.04
fairy tale explanation for just people

2307.0 --> 2311.74
getting toxic shock from massive

2309.04 --> 2314.14
mosquito bite and that even the the

2311.74 --> 2316.06
remedy that they would give

2314.14 --> 2318.7599999999998
will help

2316.06 --> 2320.5
against that toxic shock right I mean if

2318.76 --> 2322.96
it's just that simple then the whole

2320.5 --> 2326.079
malaria is basically like a cover story

2322.96 --> 2328.359
it could be that as well I don't know

2326.079 --> 2330.099
I'm not just saying oh it's all fake

2328.359 --> 2332.56
let's Chuck it in the bin never think of

2330.099 --> 2334.8590000000004
it again no no no no I I want to know

2332.56 --> 2334.859
now

2339.16 --> 2344.04
hello I saw time it saw time

2357.24 --> 2363.839
killers and really mosquitoes are

2360.339 --> 2363.839
killers in the dark are they

2371.26 --> 2376.0
are they Mark really

2383.099 --> 2388.48
mosquitoes kill more people where where

2386.079 --> 2391.5
is these records

2388.48 --> 2391.5
who do they kill

2391.78 --> 2396.9
who has died of mosquito bites recently

2399.099 --> 2406.0
where who who's ever died

2402.94 --> 2408.7000000000003
I want to see the the record I wouldn't

2406.0 --> 2410.98
see the medical record of like this

2408.7 --> 2413.64
person died from mosquito bites I've

2410.98 --> 2416.619
never ever heard of that

2413.64 --> 2419.74
a person dying from mosquito bites

2416.619 --> 2421.6600000000003
really who who died who's the most

2419.74 --> 2424.56
recent person that died in the world of

2421.66 --> 2424.56
mosquito bites

2424.78 --> 2430.3
I mean that's got to be Savage because

2427.06 --> 2432.94
like I mean yeah if you're like

2430.3 --> 2436.8390000000004
[ __ ] around at the lake and you got

2432.94 --> 2439.7200000000003
knocked out and you're like

2436.839 --> 2441.7
you lay there for an hour at night yeah

2439.72 --> 2443.4399999999996
then you might get like a million

2441.7 --> 2445.24
mosquito bites because they happen to

2443.44 --> 2448.2400000000002
hang around there with the million yeah

2445.24 --> 2452.02
that could theoretically kill you I

2448.24 --> 2454.839
could imagine right loss of blood and

2452.02 --> 2458.56
massive toxic shock yeah but I mean

2454.839 --> 2461.56
that's not something that just happens

2458.56 --> 2461.56
regularly

2467.92 --> 2470.88
laughs

2476.22 --> 2480.0
what is going on here

2492.7 --> 2500.4399999999996
dig up Millions no how about just one I

2496.66 --> 2502.8999999999996
just want to know one person one person

2500.44 --> 2504.52
this year that died of mosquito you

2502.9 --> 2506.2000000000003
literally said it's the number one

2504.52 --> 2509.02
killer

2506.2 --> 2512.2
if that's really true that you should be

2509.02 --> 2514.24
able to put it's like oh accidents like

2512.2 --> 2516.8799999999997
car accidents happen a lot well guess

2514.24 --> 2518.859
what you're going to be able to find a

2516.88 --> 2522.099
record of somebody that got killed in a

2518.859 --> 2524.619
car accident okay now let me see that

2522.099 --> 2527.02
one [ __ ] person that died from

2524.619 --> 2528.46
mosquito bites

2527.02 --> 2531.339
who

2528.46 --> 2533.68
when where

2531.339 --> 2536.64
just one person

2533.68 --> 2538.4199999999996
you don't have to post a link just say

2536.64 --> 2541.1189999999997
their name

2538.42 --> 2544.32
and their location

2541.119 --> 2544.32
just one person

2545.98 --> 2551.46
yeah all these oh this the most people

2548.619 --> 2554.57
die from oh really name me one person

2551.46 --> 2554.57
[Music]

2557.46 --> 2563.619
must be I just want to know one person

2561.64 --> 2565.02
I'm not even saying it's fake I'm just

2563.619 --> 2569.2000000000003
asking you

2565.02 --> 2571.9
one person that died from mosquito bites

2569.2 --> 2573.7599999999998
just name one

2571.9 --> 2577.42
because you're just saying it like oh

2573.76 --> 2579.46
Millions die really name me one [ __ ]

2577.42 --> 2582.46
person

2579.46 --> 2582.46
seriously

2583.599 --> 2589.2400000000002
if it's that many then any person should

2586.48 --> 2593.22
know somebody in their town

2589.24 --> 2593.22
that died from mosquito bites

2594.46 --> 2598.9
so name it

2597.04 --> 2601.119
maybe in your personal life maybe it's

2598.9 --> 2603.64
so bad that's like everybody in the

2601.119 --> 2606.4
family has so as somebody that just they

2603.64 --> 2608.859
happen to die from mosquito bites man

2606.4 --> 2612.339
you know this is true

2608.859 --> 2612.89
it's it's the number one threat like

2612.339 --> 2616.07
dude

2612.89 --> 2616.0699999999997
[Music]

2620.02 --> 2626.92
oh yes seven hundred thousand so name me

2623.319 --> 2629.14
the name of one of those seven hundred

2626.92 --> 2632.339
thousand in 2022

2629.14 --> 2632.339
and where they live

2634.78 --> 2642.28
hey Max I do you know I could just

2638.5 --> 2644.68
say things too you know I could

2642.28 --> 2646.2400000000002
I could say like did you realize that

2644.68 --> 2649.66
like

2646.24 --> 2652.7799999999997
500 000 people last year

2649.66 --> 2657.0
died from getting gangrene after having

2652.78 --> 2657.0
stopped their toe in the jungle

2658.48 --> 2661.54
right

2659.619 --> 2663.28
and I mean it sounds super plausible

2661.54 --> 2665.8
especially after I just explained that

2663.28 --> 2668.2000000000003
that's really dangerous but I mean I

2665.8 --> 2670.98
could just say that but how would you

2668.2 --> 2670.98
know that's true

2671.98 --> 2677.619
is there a record of this like

2675.099 --> 2680.98
could you name one person like you'd

2677.619 --> 2683.56
have to actually have an example of an

2680.98 --> 2685.96
individual or why would you assume to

2683.56 --> 2688.0
have a case at all if you can't even

2685.96 --> 2690.04
name an individual

2688.0 --> 2692.98
that has undergone what you're talking

2690.04 --> 2695.38
about you know

2692.98 --> 2698.619
I mean there's plenty of people that can

2695.38 --> 2701.6800000000003
actually say yeah I think that the

2698.619 --> 2705.099
medical experimentation from 2020 to up

2701.68 --> 2707.68
to 2022 killed a lot of people I have

2705.099 --> 2710.1400000000003
like two people in my family that took

2707.68 --> 2712.5989999999997
it and then died yeah now that's an

2710.14 --> 2714.2799999999997
example that then you know it's real

2712.599 --> 2719.02
because

2714.28 --> 2721.5400000000004
you can name them yeah it's right there

2719.02 --> 2724.96
just somebody saying oh five hundred

2721.54 --> 2727.619
thousand a year oh really name me one

2724.96 --> 2727.619
one

2730.599 --> 2734.1400000000003
if somebody can write down five hundred

2732.76 --> 2737.5
thousand then where are they getting

2734.14 --> 2739.06
that did they just make that up kind of

2737.5 --> 2740.2
sounds like it

2739.06 --> 2741.94
like

2740.2 --> 2744.46
maybe Source where you're getting that

2741.94 --> 2745.9
number from

2744.46 --> 2749.68
I mean there are

2745.9 --> 2750.599
records of this sort of thing right out

2749.68 --> 2753.359
there

2750.599 --> 2756.1600000000003
it's just

2753.359 --> 2757.74
I don't know I hope my point got across

2756.16 --> 2760.7799999999997
damn it these bottles

2757.74 --> 2764.1499999999996
[Music]

2760.78 --> 2767.2290000000003
just open damn it

2764.15 --> 2767.2290000000003
[Music]

2770.859 --> 2773.339
hmm

2779.8 --> 2783.42
six diseases above

2787.0 --> 2789.54
what

2795.9 --> 2802.0
all the diseases

2798.48 --> 2804.52
who did you name are collard

2802.0 --> 2807.3
are you being sarcastic now I'm a little

2804.52 --> 2807.3
confused here

2811.78 --> 2817.079
Dengue

2814.3 --> 2817.079
really

2820.54 --> 2823.74
yellow fever

2829.839 --> 2832.859
never heard of that

2835.66 --> 2839.3999999999996
why are you saying that said happy

2841.0 --> 2845.98
or it's not a virus well it's already

2843.579 --> 2848.88
called a virus so you really think that

2845.98 --> 2848.88
that's what it is

2857.52 --> 2861.42
right so there you go

2865.42 --> 2869.64
I don't think zika is real at all

2870.339 --> 2874.7799999999997
and less now virus well I don't know

2872.8 --> 2877.2400000000002
what that is but it's certainly not a

2874.78 --> 2881.1400000000003
viruses but because viruses don't exist

2877.24 --> 2884.74
they literally do not exist

2881.14 --> 2888.16
they're a fictional conjuration

2884.74 --> 2890.3799999999997
like a crazy wild experiment that like

2888.16 --> 2892.48
blatantly

2890.38 --> 2895.319
has nothing to do

2892.48 --> 2895.319
with anything

2895.96 --> 2898.5
so

2901.119 --> 2907.54
tighten your head yeah but Marco did you

2903.88 --> 2911.1400000000003
know that it was quite proven that the

2907.54 --> 2914.8
wells where that happened were poisoned

2911.14 --> 2917.5
the water wells were poisoned there

2914.8 --> 2920.099
I mean that literally even came out at

2917.5 --> 2920.099
Alex Jones

2920.44 --> 2925.54
I guess you did not get the

2922.96 --> 2926.619
the update on that

2925.54 --> 2929.7599999999998
yeah

2926.619 --> 2929.76
it doesn't exist

2929.859 --> 2933.2999999999997
they just poison people

2934.359 --> 2937.859
yeah do science yeah

2944.02 --> 2948.819
yeah the shrunken head thing was all

2946.54 --> 2951.64
because of poisoned Wells

2948.819 --> 2955.079
and potentially vaccines too

2951.64 --> 2955.0789999999997
I don't know about that one

2979.06 --> 2983.5789999999997
oh that's the other five I don't know

2980.68 --> 2983.5789999999997
about the other five

3024.96 --> 3031.7200000000003
okay thanks fluffy snow

3029.339 --> 3034.7999999999997
mm-hmm

3031.72 --> 3034.7999999999997
[Music]

3042.119 --> 3048.9
you're clammy aren't you

3045.77 --> 3048.9
[Music]

3055.559 --> 3058.28
uh

3091.16 --> 3095.7599999999998
right thanks for that letter say yours

3094.26 --> 3098.2400000000002
seemed to be very well informed about

3095.76 --> 3098.2400000000002
that

3098.4 --> 3104.119
but yeah

3101.04 --> 3104.119
like I'm not

3105.18 --> 3110.2799999999997
the whole [ __ ] medical system seems

3107.64 --> 3114.66
to be completely [ __ ]

3110.28 --> 3116.46
like way worse than I ever imagined

3114.66 --> 3118.92
I thought that was just kind of a

3116.46 --> 3120.839
vaccination issue

3118.92 --> 3122.76
that that was always a problem but I

3120.839 --> 3125.2999999999997
mean it's not even just that man it's

3122.76 --> 3125.3
crazy

3125.579 --> 3130.7400000000002
it's [ __ ] everything

3128.64 --> 3132.96
but I mean there's still people getting

3130.74 --> 3134.04
sick and dying

3132.96 --> 3137.839
but

3134.04 --> 3140.4
the reason why they notify that

3137.839 --> 3143.42
what actually happened a lot of that is

3140.4 --> 3143.42
literally not true

3144.54 --> 3150.68
it's just the model that they claim of

3148.2 --> 3150.68
what happened

3175.92 --> 3178.579
what

3178.78 --> 3181.929
[Music]

3189.72 --> 3196.02
and tried but yeah no there's a letter

3193.2 --> 3198.4199999999996
stage there's like holistic medicine

3196.02 --> 3201.74
approach that works

3198.42 --> 3201.7400000000002
on almost everything

3204.18 --> 3209.96
if you really know about that and what

3206.339 --> 3209.96
you said about the salts and

3212.88 --> 3216.8
all that other stuff what did you say

3214.68 --> 3216.7999999999997
again

3217.8 --> 3221.76
minerals toxication

3221.819 --> 3225.2
cell salts right

3227.099 --> 3233.54
and then apparently yeah pretty much

3230.76 --> 3233.5400000000004
fixes anything

3238.8 --> 3246.5
about this okay Mark collard

3242.339 --> 3246.5
getting a little conspiratorial now

3254.839 --> 3260.339
and hey

3257.52 --> 3262.5
I wouldn't complain about

3260.339 --> 3264.839
about doctors being like butchers I mean

3262.5 --> 3267.3
that's that's actually the the things

3264.839 --> 3268.38
that are very useful about them yeah is

3267.3 --> 3272.28
surgery

3268.38 --> 3274.079
that they can do that

3272.28 --> 3276.2400000000002
it's very useful

3274.079 --> 3280.52
you'll be very happy that that's around

3276.24 --> 3280.52
when you get in an accident of some kind

3283.76 --> 3289.8
but I wouldn't like

3286.26 --> 3292.5
for diseases or whatever I wouldn't go

3289.8 --> 3294.599
to them at this point I'd seek out a

3292.5 --> 3298.02
holistic doctor

3294.599 --> 3299.04
and probably like just kind of trust God

3298.02 --> 3302.18
and

3299.04 --> 3302.18
and my intuition

3302.46 --> 3310.76
and just like let food be my medicine

3305.94 --> 3310.76
right that's basically how I try to live

3311.52 --> 3316.44
and that works just fine and a lot of

3314.819 --> 3320.16
the time it's like

3316.44 --> 3322.619
the food not eating food be thy medicine

3320.16 --> 3325.74
right it's fasting

3322.619 --> 3329.78
and just good foods

3325.74 --> 3329.7799999999997
that seems to be doing miracles

3336.97 --> 3343.2
[Music]

3339.96 --> 3346.079
and stopping drinking oh man has that

3343.2 --> 3350.54
that done a lot of good

3346.079 --> 3350.54
no more stomach issues like I used to

3352.68 --> 3359.22
though more like

3354.599 --> 3360.96
like really bad bad negative feelings

3359.22 --> 3363.18
that like

3360.96 --> 3364.98
smear off and I don't mean that I don't

3363.18 --> 3366.839
rage because I still do it I still get

3364.98 --> 3367.98
outraged right

3366.839 --> 3371.22
but

3367.98 --> 3373.5
no more like real negative vibe like you

3371.22 --> 3376.02
just like feel like you hate the world

3373.5 --> 3377.7
kind of nasty like that used to come out

3376.02 --> 3381.119
a bit too

3377.7 --> 3383.8799999999997
with the alcohol it does that

3381.119 --> 3386.76
and it is worrisome

3383.88 --> 3391.7000000000003
but I don't have that sort of impulse at

3386.76 --> 3391.7000000000003
all anymore since I I just don't drink

3391.8 --> 3397.26
nothing and I'm like really glad that I

3394.619 --> 3400.1400000000003
don't drink sometimes I feel like oh

3397.26 --> 3402.1400000000003
this would be a great day for a beer

3400.14 --> 3403.44
and then I'm like

3402.14 --> 3406.44
[Music]

3403.44 --> 3408.359
no no it wouldn't

3406.44 --> 3411.78
how many times do I

3408.359 --> 3414.66
need to say that and and like realize

3411.78 --> 3418.02
that it's not really true

3414.66 --> 3420.359
so I'm like letting myself get I'm

3418.02 --> 3421.8
letting the seduction impulses in to

3420.359 --> 3425.94
kind of like

3421.8 --> 3428.6400000000003
lay the tent the tension of it

3425.94 --> 3431.28
so it's like less effort of having to

3428.64 --> 3434.339
not to drink it's like no I'll let

3431.28 --> 3436.7400000000002
myself be seduced a bit but I mean

3434.339 --> 3438.96
everything every time now I think about

3436.74 --> 3440.8799999999997
it in the moment in Supermarket looking

3438.96 --> 3444.9
at it it's just like

3440.88 --> 3447.859
yeah it it's just

3444.9 --> 3447.859
it's not real

3448.02 --> 3452.66
it's not what you think it is every time

3452.94 --> 3456.7200000000003
I mean yeah the moment of fun might be

3455.22 --> 3459.2999999999997
there for a bit

3456.72 --> 3461.22
but I mean then like your spiritual

3459.3 --> 3463.5
chemistry just kind of changes after

3461.22 --> 3465.66
that and I don't want it anymore I I

3463.5 --> 3468.42
want this

3465.66 --> 3470.3999999999996
spiritual strength to be stable

3468.42 --> 3472.26
because I do have like a lot of

3470.4 --> 3475.579
spiritual energy

3472.26 --> 3475.579
available to me

3478.98 --> 3483.96
and the dream walking is like better

3482.4 --> 3486.7200000000003
because

3483.96 --> 3490.319
I literally dream walk

3486.72 --> 3493.859
from Wake till sleep now all the time

3490.319 --> 3495.66
it's like it's a Non-Stop process

3493.859 --> 3500.359
it's like I have my life but I'm

3495.66 --> 3500.359
continually dream walking all the time

3501.599 --> 3505.619
I couldn't do that when I was drinking

3504.0 --> 3507.54
like

3505.619 --> 3510.3
I would do that and then the alcohol

3507.54 --> 3513.24
would kind of like Tire me down

3510.3 --> 3515.52
and then I just gotta get stuck

3513.24 --> 3519.0
and then don't do it and just be simple

3515.52 --> 3521.64
like oh watch a movie and be [ __ ]

3519.0 --> 3523.98
and that's the weird thing is that doing

3521.64 --> 3526.14
that seemed relieving it's like oh I

3523.98 --> 3528.299
can't just be [ __ ] enough not to

3526.14 --> 3530.94
think complicated about things just be

3528.299 --> 3533.96
stupid it's like oh thank God hold the

3530.94 --> 3533.96
processes for a bit

3534.119 --> 3538.98
but

3536.52 --> 3540.559
it's pointless because now I don't have

3538.98 --> 3543.059
that

3540.559 --> 3546.299
but at the same time

3543.059 --> 3549.059
it's so second nature to just have it be

3546.299 --> 3553.559
spun up all the time

3549.059 --> 3555.5400000000004
but it doesn't Tire me it's I don't have

3553.559 --> 3557.579
any moments like oh man I gotta lay it

3555.54 --> 3559.98
down I gotta stop thinking for it's like

3557.579 --> 3561.0
no it's literally it's like this Dynamo

3559.98 --> 3563.88
or

3561.0 --> 3565.079
this thing is just it's just running

3563.88 --> 3567.7200000000003
forever

3565.079 --> 3570.3590000000004
it's running while I sleep

3567.72 --> 3573.48
it's it's always running

3570.359 --> 3577.339
it's like a gyroscope and it never stops

3573.48 --> 3577.339
and it's not tiresome at all

3578.22 --> 3586.02
it's alcohol makes it tiresome

3582.119 --> 3588.059
alcohol makes you tired to think

3586.02 --> 3590.7
it does it does do that it does do that

3588.059 --> 3593.0400000000004
to me not necessarily in the moment when

3590.7 --> 3596.339
you're drinking but all the rest of the

3593.04 --> 3597.839
time that surround those moments it does

3596.339 --> 3600.9
do that

3597.839 --> 3603.72
and then when you don't drink

3600.9 --> 3608.54
you don't have that it just I'm not

3603.72 --> 3608.54
I'm never tired in my mind like that

3608.64 --> 3613.319
now

3611.28 --> 3615.8390000000004
right and that by the way includes me

3613.319 --> 3617.7599999999998
still smoking joints and all that right

3615.839 --> 3620.52
so

3617.76 --> 3623.0
even with that it's like I don't get

3620.52 --> 3623.0
tired

3627.839 --> 3635.16
now with cannabis that seems to

3631.68 --> 3637.6189999999997
not intrude within those processes

3635.16 --> 3640.2599999999998
alcohol definitely does

3637.619 --> 3642.48
it intrudes in those processes and you

3640.26 --> 3646.26
do get tired then

3642.48 --> 3650.4
yeah alcohol's not like oh it tires out

3646.26 --> 3654.0
your body you have like 20 percent less

3650.4 --> 3656.46
like capacity to do stuff no it's not

3654.0 --> 3660.18
about that it influences like your

3656.46 --> 3662.579
spirit like that it's a tiresome spirit

3660.18 --> 3666.2
that it brings it's not like a physical

3662.579 --> 3666.2000000000003
tiredness necessarily

3669.9 --> 3674.46
right so yeah drinking not a good thing

3672.359 --> 3677.2799999999997
I mean

3674.46 --> 3678.839
maybe some of you liked it drink a beer

3677.28 --> 3680.88
here and there with buddies or whatever

3678.839 --> 3683.599
I get it

3680.88 --> 3683.599
but

3684.78 --> 3688.92
you got to be very careful and if you

3687.059 --> 3692.42
like notice that you're gonna drink

3688.92 --> 3692.42
every day then you got a problem

3693.059 --> 3696.059
foreign

3698.76 --> 3705.079
and so I quit since January and I'm

3701.339 --> 3705.0789999999997
still there and I'm very glad

3721.98 --> 3727.619
ah right yeah flatter said you got to be

3725.04 --> 3732.0589999999997
careful with that too I mean

3727.619 --> 3733.26
those super strong American breeds are

3732.059 --> 3734.88
terrible

3733.26 --> 3737.099
like

3734.88 --> 3740.339
I don't know who can smoke that stuff

3737.099 --> 3743.7000000000003
and feel good with it

3740.339 --> 3747.2
it's like a tranquilizer

3743.7 --> 3747.2
it's just way too much

3747.299 --> 3752.28
it's not comfortable so yeah I don't

3750.24 --> 3753.7999999999997
smoke strains that are too strong and

3752.28 --> 3758.5890000000004
all that

3753.8 --> 3758.5890000000004
[Music]

3759.119 --> 3761.6600000000003
dogs

3762.0 --> 3768.96
no they use horses for that Richard G

3766.319 --> 3771.619
from what I heard they specifically used

3768.96 --> 3771.619
the horses

3772.2 --> 3778.3799999999997
never heard of dogs being used for that

3776.04 --> 3779.94
maybe they they're used to that too I

3778.38 --> 3781.6800000000003
don't know but from what I heard it was

3779.94 --> 3784.14
mostly horses

3781.68 --> 3787.3799999999997
horses could take a lot of it

3784.14 --> 3789.24
and produce a lot of antibodies

3787.38 --> 3791.78
and like have no issue with it

3789.24 --> 3791.7799999999997
whatsoever

3799.98 --> 3803.78
it's hard to use dogs hmm

3805.14 --> 3810.5989999999997
well maybe look

3807.24 --> 3813.18
having a dog around is cheaper than

3810.599 --> 3817.1400000000003
having a horse so maybe they

3813.18 --> 3819.4199999999996
figured out well these dogs also work

3817.14 --> 3821.0989999999997
and they're cheaper to keep around

3819.42 --> 3823.5
so that could be the reason why they're

3821.099 --> 3826.94
now do you doing it with dogs but from

3823.5 --> 3826.94
what I heard it was always horses

3827.64 --> 3831.5589999999997
that they even figured it out

3831.66 --> 3836.52
like they from what I heard this could

3834.0 --> 3839.22
be a myth whatever I don't know even how

3836.52 --> 3841.14
old that trick is but from what I heard

3839.22 --> 3844.6189999999997
it was like

3841.14 --> 3848.22
through a horse getting bit by a snake

3844.619 --> 3850.319
and then it just dealing with it

3848.22 --> 3853.7
and still being in good condition that

3850.319 --> 3853.7
it was even figured out

3854.4 --> 3857.94
like

3856.079 --> 3860.4
that some doctor at some point just

3857.94 --> 3862.92
decided to start tapping the blood of it

3860.4 --> 3864.839
and it's like yeah maybe if we just use

3862.92 --> 3866.2200000000003
this Blood the horse seems to be able to

3864.839 --> 3870.119
deal with it

3866.22 --> 3871.799
and that that way the anti-venom was

3870.119 --> 3874.44
actually discovered

3871.799 --> 3876.799
by horses being able to handle snake

3874.44 --> 3876.799
bites

3878.579 --> 3885.48
because I mean a dog

3881.4 --> 3888.1800000000003
is a lot less body mass so

3885.48 --> 3890.7
snake bites for dogs are gonna on

3888.18 --> 3893.8799999999997
average be more likely to be fatal

3890.7 --> 3896.4199999999996
because they just have less body mass

3893.88 --> 3896.42
anyway

3914.64 --> 3920.819
by the way I might be getting some of

3916.799 --> 3922.68
this snake venom data from like I think

3920.819 --> 3925.46
I might have learned this from like the

3922.68 --> 3925.46
History Channel

3925.559 --> 3929.3590000000004
in the early 2000s

3935.28 --> 3939.3590000000004
were some interesting documentary like

3937.44 --> 3942.119
Nature Documentaries and History Channel

3939.359 --> 3944.2799999999997
it wasn't just Globe ball [ __ ] and

3942.119 --> 3946.1400000000003
climate change propaganda

3944.28 --> 3948.98
although that was already getting in

3946.14 --> 3951.299
Discovery was much worse with it

3948.98 --> 3954.0
Discovery Channel was really the thing

3951.299 --> 3957.48
that really started cranking up the

3954.0 --> 3959.04
climate change guilt [ __ ] so

3957.48 --> 3963.079
annoying

3959.04 --> 3963.079
they started early with that crap

3964.079 --> 3968.2200000000003
and it sucked because I really used to

3966.119 --> 3970.319
love Discovery because of just all their

3968.22 --> 3972.9599999999996
nature documentary stuff and all that

3970.319 --> 3974.88
but then just more and more climate

3972.96 --> 3979.16
change binding and it became just more

3974.88 --> 3979.1600000000003
about that it sucked so bad

3979.44 --> 3984.2400000000002
so I haven't actually watched Discovery

3982.02 --> 3987.38
since 2000

3984.24 --> 3987.3799999999997
six or seven

3988.799 --> 3993.78
but I used to watch it all the time like

3991.14 --> 3996.0789999999997
in the in the first decade of the 21st

3993.78 --> 3996.079
Century

4006.859 --> 4009.859
ah

4009.98 --> 4014.14
oh that's fascinating more colored

4015.14 --> 4021.0789999999997
wow that sucks by the way I mean it's

4018.559 --> 4023.42
cool that that works but if that

4021.079 --> 4027.6400000000003
actually works but I mean it's like

4023.42 --> 4027.64
damn it I got bit by a snake oh no no no

4029.119 --> 4032.78
oh

4030.5 --> 4036.46
kind of [ __ ]

4032.78 --> 4036.46
[ __ ] but if it works I mean

4052.4 --> 4058.1800000000003
there's some benefit yeah from consuming

4055.64 --> 4058.18
it I think

4058.28 --> 4064.1600000000003
I think yeah and that's the same by the

4060.74 --> 4066.7599999999998
way goes for like B Venom too

4064.16 --> 4066.7599999999998
weird

4070.96 --> 4074.68
spider music

4078.319 --> 4083.18
but I even heard that about like snake

4080.9 --> 4086.1800000000003
venom that it

4083.18 --> 4089.0
don't take my word on this though please

4086.18 --> 4091.64
that like consuming it actually has some

4089.0 --> 4093.92
kind of good function

4091.64 --> 4096.5599999999995
but yeah don't consume it if you like

4093.92 --> 4098.06
have an ulcer or something if you have

4096.56 --> 4100.46
any kind of wound

4098.06 --> 4102.1990000000005
and in your digestion system that could

4100.46 --> 4105.4
be very dangerous

4102.199 --> 4105.4
right but uh

4107.359 --> 4113.02
I heard that it's consumed too

4110.239 --> 4113.0199999999995
very weird

4134.719 --> 4137.38
foreign

4139.299 --> 4146.319
snakes in my country no

4143.179 --> 4146.319
except in the zoo

4149.779 --> 4154.96
there are some places where there are

4151.64 --> 4154.96
snakes but they're not poisonous

4156.81 --> 4159.939
[Music]

4161.179 --> 4166.52
it's kind of funny because

4163.52 --> 4168.9800000000005
in the old Palace

4166.52 --> 4171.4400000000005
like where the

4168.98 --> 4173.48
the mother of

4171.44 --> 4177.3189999999995
oh God that's like that grandmother of

4173.48 --> 4180.0199999999995
our King now used to live there

4177.319 --> 4183.259
like very near my old

4180.02 --> 4186.14
my old house where I live with my mother

4183.259 --> 4187.58
and all that but like there's a forest

4186.14 --> 4189.92
like really close to that that's

4187.58 --> 4192.38
literally called snake Forest

4189.92 --> 4195.88
and there's like wild snakes in it

4192.38 --> 4195.88
and they're like protected

4200.239 --> 4205.04
so yeah that's Forest is just filled

4203.42 --> 4207.6990000000005
with these snakes

4205.04 --> 4207.699
this is

4207.8 --> 4211.9400000000005
and so that there's little there's very

4210.38 --> 4214.9400000000005
little Vermin there

4211.94 --> 4214.94
unsurprisingly

4216.08 --> 4220.42
because snakes eat Vermin of course

4227.0 --> 4230.32
but they're not poisonous

4242.8 --> 4248.02
snakes

4244.58 --> 4248.0199999999995
yeah well

4250.76 --> 4255.860000000001
I always find snakes to feel so weird

4253.1 --> 4259.280000000001
and rubbery

4255.86 --> 4260.839999999999
the snakes are weird creatures

4259.28 --> 4264.259999999999
but

4260.84 --> 4267.76
they're not bad or anything they're

4264.26 --> 4267.76
reptilian minded but

4270.739 --> 4274.659
I don't know I think snakes are nice

4274.76 --> 4281.4400000000005
it's not I wouldn't want like a

4277.64 --> 4281.4400000000005
personally a snake as a pet or anything

4281.48 --> 4286.04
but yeah I mean I've had friends that

4284.0 --> 4289.239
have snakes as pets and yeah I was

4286.04 --> 4289.239
thought yeah that's pretty cool

4299.8 --> 4305.08
Reckless lizards are interesting

4302.96 --> 4305.08
um

4315.26 --> 4322.1
emergency talking snake

4318.62 --> 4323.78
well that's not that uncommon at all zap

4322.1 --> 4325.52
Taffy

4323.78 --> 4328.219
in

4325.52 --> 4333.280000000001
in the Astro Realm

4328.219 --> 4333.28
there there are snakes that talk

4333.679 --> 4338.0
dragons

4335.719 --> 4339.32
and they're snake people and they talk

4338.0 --> 4341.659
too

4339.32 --> 4343.759999999999
the reptilians

4341.659 --> 4346.94
and there's probably other things too

4343.76 --> 4349.64
like insectoids which would you would

4346.94 --> 4351.08
probably think of as like alien Grays or

4349.64 --> 4355.219
something

4351.08 --> 4355.219
but they're really insectoids

4357.8 --> 4362.679
so

4359.0 --> 4362.679
yeah there's all kinds of weird things

4370.58 --> 4376.34
I mean what if I told you that like in

4372.86 --> 4379.58
that the Astro realm like animals

4376.34 --> 4383.08
like talk to but not using their mouth

4379.58 --> 4383.08
they're just telepathic

4400.159 --> 4406.299999999999
right

4401.6 --> 4406.3
anyway it might be a little vague now

4427.4 --> 4432.62
all right and by the way every time you

4429.62 --> 4435.26
see a snake just do the tongue thing

4432.62 --> 4437.3
just think of it is like this when they

4435.26 --> 4439.6
do the tongue thing that's their way of

4437.3 --> 4442.820000000001
doing

4439.6 --> 4444.92
that's smelling that's literally what

4442.82 --> 4446.739
that is right so if you see your snake

4444.92 --> 4450.9400000000005
that the tongue like this

4446.739 --> 4450.94
that's literally them doing like

4451.76 --> 4456.679
so that's

4453.8 --> 4460.12
they're just sniffing their surrounding

4456.679 --> 4460.12
that's how they do that

4479.719 --> 4484.4800000000005
how do we know astral Realms exist

4489.08 --> 4494.179
well I've been there

4491.06 --> 4495.9800000000005
first of all and yeah I mean it doesn't

4494.179 --> 4498.88
really matter they don't physically

4495.98 --> 4498.879999999999
exist so

4498.92 --> 4505.28
there's like you can't prove it

4502.46 --> 4506.9
scientifically it's like yeah oh let's

4505.28 --> 4508.759999999999
prove that this is yeah you can

4506.9 --> 4510.92
experience it

4508.76 --> 4515.08
you can't prove it

4510.92 --> 4515.08
people will argue around it

4516.44 --> 4522.919999999999
but yeah animals are telepathic

4519.8 --> 4524.6
and they didn't lose it

4522.92 --> 4527.6
we lost it

4524.6 --> 4530.679
animals didn't lose televathy

4527.6 --> 4530.679
they still have it

4531.5 --> 4537.199
and by the way humans to a degree also

4534.56 --> 4539.900000000001
still have it they just kind of lost the

4537.199 --> 4541.4
art of using it because they're so

4539.9 --> 4545.679
distracted

4541.4 --> 4545.679
by their rationalized mind

4545.78 --> 4549.98
right

4547.46 --> 4552.62
we're all trained and conditioned to

4549.98 --> 4555.32
kind of see our Intuit intuitive

4552.62 --> 4557.78
impulses and things as like primitive

4555.32 --> 4560.9
Superstition oh you guys that trust the

4557.78 --> 4563.9
systems and and the statistics and the

4560.9 --> 4567.259999999999
people in lab coats

4563.9 --> 4570.44
but we still have that like I have it I

4567.26 --> 4573.08
use it I am like practically telepathic

4570.44 --> 4575.0
at times it's just you know like oh

4573.08 --> 4576.739
let's tune in what they're saying inside

4575.0 --> 4578.719
their head no that's not how it works

4576.739 --> 4581.36
you would just figure out who somebody

4578.719 --> 4583.64
is how they work where they're at in the

4581.36 --> 4586.659
moment and where they're going

4583.64 --> 4589.159000000001
it's all about understanding

4586.659 --> 4591.92
understanding other people what they are

4589.159 --> 4593.839999999999
experiencing what that is like to be

4591.92 --> 4596.06
able to literally

4593.84 --> 4598.76
with your higher Consciousness crawl

4596.06 --> 4603.219
within their skin

4598.76 --> 4603.219
and see things from their perspective

4603.44 --> 4610.178999999999
on a spiritual level and that provides

4606.32 --> 4610.179
real telepathic insight

4611.239 --> 4617.0599999999995
it's like super empathy

4614.12 --> 4618.98
you can like empathy can just let be

4617.06 --> 4620.659000000001
wounding to you because you always feel

4618.98 --> 4623.0599999999995
all the [ __ ] everywhere

4620.659 --> 4626.48
or you could protect yourself from that

4623.06 --> 4628.6990000000005
and then only like shoot out like use it

4626.48 --> 4631.099999999999
very in a focused way

4628.699 --> 4633.0199999999995
to attain incredible levels of

4631.1 --> 4635.42
information

4633.02 --> 4637.34
that are not available to people that

4635.42 --> 4639.4400000000005
aren't that sensitive

4637.34 --> 4641.659000000001
but you gotta time it well because you

4639.44 --> 4643.94
can't just keep it all

4641.659 --> 4646.219
out and open because then you get all

4643.94 --> 4647.599999999999
the damage too

4646.219 --> 4650.0
right

4647.6 --> 4651.9800000000005
you can't just keep it all open all the

4650.0 --> 4653.48
time you get all the damage you get all

4651.98 --> 4656.32
the [ __ ] upness that people aren't

4653.48 --> 4656.32
even conscious about

4656.6 --> 4659.4400000000005
so

4660.14 --> 4666.76
anyone heard The Whispers over millions

4663.32 --> 4666.759999999999
asking for help

4675.26 --> 4682.54
but for my own

4678.08 --> 4682.54
survival I stopped listening to that

4682.58 --> 4689.42
it's like I decided I can't help I can

4685.699 --> 4692.0599999999995
only help those that are directly

4689.42 --> 4695.14
around me it's like if you are able to

4692.06 --> 4695.14
tolerate me

4695.36 --> 4701.44
and not in a parasitical way then you

4698.659 --> 4701.44
get my help

4704.179 --> 4708.86
because if I just like wanted to help

4706.219 --> 4711.44
everybody out there I'd literally just

4708.86 --> 4713.78
roll in in all kinds of things want to

4711.44 --> 4715.4
help it wouldn't be I wouldn't be

4713.78 --> 4717.0199999999995
thanked for it I would be seen as

4715.4 --> 4720.259999999999
invasive

4717.02 --> 4724.780000000001
and people would not actually help

4720.26 --> 4724.780000000001
sustain me for that effort I think

4732.62 --> 4739.0
unless you like become part of their

4734.719 --> 4739.0
machine and I'm not gonna do that

4739.1 --> 4744.820000000001
I will not become a cog in some

4741.56 --> 4744.820000000001
industrial system

4745.239 --> 4748.48
like that

4749.84 --> 4753.62
how does the Astro realm compare to the

4752.3 --> 4757.4800000000005
Dark World

4753.62 --> 4757.48
well it's technically the same place

4760.699 --> 4768.5599999999995
except the Dark World was my experience

4764.179 --> 4768.56
the Dark World was altered

4770.659 --> 4776.299999999999
yeah the Astro realm is like the the

4773.659 --> 4778.219
Prismatic rainbow stuff where you end up

4776.3 --> 4780.26
a lot of people that use a little

4778.219 --> 4781.76
hallucinogenics

4780.26 --> 4784.280000000001
unguided

4781.76 --> 4786.1990000000005
like take Ayahuasca unguided like on

4784.28 --> 4789.32
their own yeah that's you're gonna see

4786.199 --> 4790.759999999999
like the Super Rainbow world that's the

4789.32 --> 4792.799999999999
first thing yeah well that's what

4790.76 --> 4795.56
happened with me too and then the

4792.8 --> 4797.06
entities basically

4795.56 --> 4798.860000000001
changed it

4797.06 --> 4800.6
I didn't want it to be changed I like

4798.86 --> 4803.48
the rainbow colors but

4800.6 --> 4805.76
they insisted they literally got in my

4803.48 --> 4807.259999999999
head yeah that's where you realize wait

4805.76 --> 4809.719
it's not physical

4807.26 --> 4811.52
because you could feel like the location

4809.719 --> 4813.92
of something

4811.52 --> 4817.88
like going through you yeah it's totally

4813.92 --> 4819.92
surreal and then they like flipped like

4817.88 --> 4822.38
a switch or something it's like clack

4819.92 --> 4826.179
and then it the Prismatic colors went

4822.38 --> 4826.179
away and it turned into the Dark World

4826.28 --> 4831.08
and now everything was super clear a lot

4829.219 --> 4834.679
more Shadow around but everything was

4831.08 --> 4836.719
like really clear and contrasted instead

4834.679 --> 4840.8
of like Prismatic [ __ ] all over the

4836.719 --> 4842.6
place which is like kind of bizarre

4840.8 --> 4845.6
and confusing

4842.6 --> 4848.719
and that's why I call it the Dark World

4845.6 --> 4852.38
also because I never saw any Celestial

4848.719 --> 4855.219
light during any of the experiences that

4852.38 --> 4855.219
took place there

4856.28 --> 4860.659
it was always dark even when it was

4858.86 --> 4862.339999999999
obvious daylight

4860.659 --> 4865.639999999999
it's like even when it's daylight you

4862.34 --> 4867.92
could see the sunlight on things on

4865.64 --> 4872.179
people's skin on the ground

4867.92 --> 4874.28
but the background would be black

4872.179 --> 4876.5
that sort of thing that's why I call it

4874.28 --> 4878.9
the Dark World

4876.5 --> 4881.9
but I'm pretty sure that it all took

4878.9 --> 4883.82
place in the Astro realm which is a

4881.9 --> 4886.28
non-physical place it's a place where

4883.82 --> 4888.739
you basically with your mind project any

4886.28 --> 4892.9
kind of environment

4888.739 --> 4892.9
because there is no physicality there

4896.06 --> 4901.88
you just with your mind cling on to

4899.239 --> 4904.959999999999
physicality to provide meaning

4901.88 --> 4904.96
for the experience

4905.9 --> 4910.46
and eventually if you're long in it

4908.54 --> 4912.739
enough you realize that you're basically

4910.46 --> 4915.679
just kind of dream contemplating about

4912.739 --> 4918.678999999999
things in your Waking Life

4915.679 --> 4921.38
with like a holographic projection

4918.679 --> 4925.9400000000005
experience of that so it's like a super

4921.38 --> 4928.58
Advanced dreaming like lucid dreaming

4925.94 --> 4931.4
where you're really snapped into it and

4928.58 --> 4933.32
you stay into it it's like lucid

4931.4 --> 4935.12
dreaming that doesn't like oh you're

4933.32 --> 4937.759999999999
holding on to it and then oh

4935.12 --> 4939.86
it ends no no it just keeps going and

4937.76 --> 4942.1990000000005
keeps going and then it's like

4939.86 --> 4944.599999999999
you get to like afterward after

4942.199 --> 4946.82
something was shown and all that you get

4944.6 --> 4950.120000000001
to think about it within the freaking

4946.82 --> 4953.239
lucid dream afterward and then move on

4950.12 --> 4955.219
to a next thing even discuss that

4953.239 --> 4959.08
what you're gonna move to next like

4955.219 --> 4959.08
that's what it was like

4959.84 --> 4964.06
so it's not just a lucid dream

4964.58 --> 4971.239
but it reminisces a lot of it

4968.239 --> 4973.5199999999995
although personally I usually

4971.239 --> 4975.678999999999
all my lucid dreams are always like

4973.52 --> 4978.320000000001
bathing in light there's always a lot of

4975.679 --> 4980.3
light for me in lucid dreams

4978.32 --> 4982.42
and in the dark world that was not the

4980.3 --> 4982.42
case

4988.58 --> 4995.0599999999995
you think people who have passed are

4990.86 --> 4997.839999999999
trapped you heard wow okay

4995.06 --> 4997.84
uh

4998.0 --> 5004.3
well yeah you could think of the Dark

5001.179 --> 5006.1
World as being the afterlife that's the

5004.3 --> 5008.38
place you could be stuck

5006.1 --> 5011.4400000000005
you're just doing that experience that

5008.38 --> 5013.78
I've done for freaking 80 years

5011.44 --> 5017.199
but the weird thing is is that

5013.78 --> 5019.599999999999
despite me doing that for so long in

5017.199 --> 5021.159
that experience based

5019.6 --> 5023.8
timeline

5021.159 --> 5026.099999999999
in physical reality there was no time

5023.8 --> 5029.88
that had passed

5026.1 --> 5029.88
like two minutes

5031.239 --> 5037.08
so time is different there

5034.0 --> 5040.48
and if you would presuppose

5037.08 --> 5042.159
that after your death you go to the

5040.48 --> 5044.44
Astro Realm

5042.159 --> 5046.299999999999
and basically do the things that I was

5044.44 --> 5048.5199999999995
doing there during my Dark World Vision

5046.3 --> 5050.92
and hey they did say like oh you're

5048.52 --> 5053.26
going to die

5050.92 --> 5057.659
well maybe I had that experience because

5053.26 --> 5057.659000000001
it was like a a death experience

5058.78 --> 5065.82
I feared death though while I was I was

5062.38 --> 5065.82
afraid that I wouldn't wake up

5070.179 --> 5075.46
but I mean yeah it could very well be

5073.0 --> 5079.84
that that is where you are in the

5075.46 --> 5081.76
afterlife until further notice

5079.84 --> 5085.12
and you could say oh you're stuck there

5081.76 --> 5089.26
what stuck in a Perpetual Holodeck

5085.12 --> 5091.12
where you are like Beyond Time as in you

5089.26 --> 5093.52
can literally go back and forth within

5091.12 --> 5096.76
like a very long time span it's like you

5093.52 --> 5101.14
can go back and forth within time

5096.76 --> 5103.719
as far as you can actually associate

5101.14 --> 5105.88
so there is a lit you like I wouldn't be

5103.719 --> 5107.44
able to go like 200 years into the

5105.88 --> 5109.1990000000005
future

5107.44 --> 5112.12
because

5109.199 --> 5115.12
I can't here here comes the tricky part

5112.12 --> 5117.76
because even at that old age even if I'm

5115.12 --> 5119.98
like super peeking I can't reach that

5117.76 --> 5123.219
far I can't

5119.98 --> 5127.178999999999
I can't predict how much things will

5123.219 --> 5129.76
change in all that time because I'm not

5127.179 --> 5131.679
there to experience that form of

5129.76 --> 5133.900000000001
transformation in order to actually

5131.679 --> 5136.719
foresee what things it will be like in

5133.9 --> 5139.659
the future so because of that I will not

5136.719 --> 5142.719
be able to travel within the afterlife

5139.659 --> 5146.199
experience that far I can only reach

5142.719 --> 5147.34
around my lifetime and even very far in

5146.199 --> 5149.259999999999
the past

5147.34 --> 5151.54
but I mean what you're gonna imagine

5149.26 --> 5153.219
there is going to be partially ignorant

5151.54 --> 5154.84
because it's all based on what you

5153.219 --> 5157.5
believed

5154.84 --> 5157.5
to be

5159.699 --> 5164.919999999999
right so that's up

5162.58 --> 5167.8
a potential thing

5164.92 --> 5170.02
and that would be you could consider

5167.8 --> 5171.6990000000005
that as like the waiting Row for the

5170.02 --> 5173.9800000000005
final judgment it's like yeah you could

5171.699 --> 5175.96
you get your own afterlife Hall attack

5173.98 --> 5178.138999999999
and you can literally do whatever you

5175.96 --> 5178.139
want

5181.48 --> 5185.5599999999995
to basically fulfill your spirit's

5183.94 --> 5188.799999999999
curiosity

5185.56 --> 5191.159000000001
yeah Cleary why don't you just shut the

5188.8 --> 5191.159000000001
[ __ ] up

5201.34 --> 5205.7390000000005
moxie what the [ __ ] are you talking like

5203.56 --> 5205.7390000000005
that

5210.94 --> 5216.36
don't don't [ __ ] talk like that moxie

5246.1 --> 5251.5
are ghosts real

5249.1 --> 5254.8
oh God we get in yeah by the way I'm

5251.5 --> 5256.96
fine with you asking those questions

5254.8 --> 5258.28
but it is kind of typical are ghosts

5256.96 --> 5260.32
real yes

5258.28 --> 5262.3
but what are they well they're not

5260.32 --> 5267.179
living things and they're not even the

5262.3 --> 5267.179
spirit they're an echo ghosts are echoes

5267.46 --> 5271.0
so

5269.08 --> 5273.88
the spirits

5271.0 --> 5276.46
living beings in if they have a lot of

5273.88 --> 5278.26
intense intense moments their Spirit can

5276.46 --> 5280.659
literally rub off they can make an

5278.26 --> 5284.02
imprint on the material

5280.659 --> 5287.0199999999995
and that like especially wood

5284.02 --> 5287.02
absorbs

5287.38 --> 5291.34
a spirit and then if a spirit is

5289.239 --> 5293.259999999999
absorbed by that within what in their

5291.34 --> 5297.400000000001
frequency of what they are

5293.26 --> 5299.7390000000005
then that imprint can literally like tap

5297.4 --> 5301.659
into people that are sensitive to this

5299.739 --> 5303.218999999999
sort of thing like median type knee

5301.659 --> 5309.179
empaths

5303.219 --> 5309.179
and then a ghost will like a recording

5309.699 --> 5317.94
do its thing in a form of communication

5314.38 --> 5319.900000000001
so a ghost is almost like a

5317.94 --> 5322.299999999999
[Music]

5319.9 --> 5326.32
h

5322.3 --> 5328.0
it's like a voicemail recording

5326.32 --> 5330.4
for empaths

5328.0 --> 5332.98
it's kind of what ghosts are it's an

5330.4 --> 5334.299999999999
imprint that's people leave you can

5332.98 --> 5337.36
erase that

5334.3 --> 5340.42
with electromagnetism it's like an EMP

5337.36 --> 5342.699
device you can literally erase ghosts

5340.42 --> 5345.639
watch The Legend of Hell House it's a

5342.699 --> 5349.419999999999
very old movie about ghosts

5345.639 --> 5352.9800000000005
that is very interesting because of what

5349.42 --> 5352.9800000000005
it's about it's very technical

5355.3 --> 5359.02
so old movie check it out Legend of Hill

5358.06 --> 5362.38
House

5359.02 --> 5365.139
it's scary in a way but it's it's not

5362.38 --> 5367.179
like horror Escape but it is actually

5365.139 --> 5370.719
scary because all those things they talk

5367.179 --> 5373.9
about are all based on real things real

5370.719 --> 5375.52
things that real people really did in

5373.9 --> 5379.299999999999
the world

5375.52 --> 5381.280000000001
it is like a whole mishmash of like

5379.3 --> 5383.7390000000005
occultic things that have actually

5381.28 --> 5385.48
happened the people actually did it's

5383.739 --> 5389.08
really fascinating

5385.48 --> 5391.0599999999995
right but ghosts are imprints ghosts are

5389.08 --> 5395.5
not Spirits they're like

5391.06 --> 5398.56
Spirit imprints an imprint that was done

5395.5 --> 5400.78
from usually traumatic situations the

5398.56 --> 5403.780000000001
communication in emergency communication

5400.78 --> 5406.179
or like a reminder of a tragedy is like

5403.78 --> 5407.86
they needed theirs they needed to share

5406.179 --> 5409.6
their story and they couldn't then they

5407.86 --> 5411.759999999999
died while they'll leave their imprint

5409.6 --> 5415.3
off that story because they needed that

5411.76 --> 5416.1990000000005
so the need to communicate that is the

5415.3 --> 5420.28
thing

5416.199 --> 5422.199
that was desperately tensed upon death

5420.28 --> 5424.78
imprinting

5422.199 --> 5425.5599999999995
and then people walking into that relive

5424.78 --> 5427.719
it

5425.56 --> 5431.219
and they might get like it would

5427.719 --> 5431.219
technically be hallucinations

5431.98 --> 5438.218999999999
of that person that left that imprint

5436.42 --> 5440.26
but they are not there that's like a

5438.219 --> 5443.02
tape recording you can't then

5440.26 --> 5446.1990000000005
interactively communicate with that

5443.02 --> 5449.080000000001
it's going to be like a poor simulacrum

5446.199 --> 5451.599999999999
construct it might give some data

5449.08 --> 5454.42
feedback but very little because it's

5451.6 --> 5456.6990000000005
not the actual consciousness

5454.42 --> 5458.7390000000005
of the person

5456.699 --> 5460.54
that left the imprint you see that's the

5458.739 --> 5463.299999999999
difference

5460.54 --> 5465.28
an actual Spirit experience is very

5463.3 --> 5467.26
different from a ghost

5465.28 --> 5470.139
like actually communicating with the

5467.26 --> 5474.34
dead is very bizarre because

5470.139 --> 5475.900000000001
when you do that mediums and I've met a

5474.34 --> 5477.58
few mediums talk to a few mediums

5475.9 --> 5478.9
actually did that sort of thing with

5477.58 --> 5481.54
mediums

5478.9 --> 5483.879999999999
and

5481.54 --> 5486.46
yeah depending on the spirit like

5483.88 --> 5491.32
actually interfacing with a spirit of

5486.46 --> 5494.199
the Dead is yeah is much more intense

5491.32 --> 5495.94
than interacting with the imprint of a

5494.199 --> 5497.98
ghost

5495.94 --> 5500.32
it's much more intense actually dealing

5497.98 --> 5503.138999999999
with the actual Spirit can be very dark

5500.32 --> 5505.259999999999
and can be very exhilaratingly light as

5503.139 --> 5505.26
well

5506.159 --> 5511.839999999999
because real spirits

5509.62 --> 5514.3
of the Dead even like they have a lot

5511.84 --> 5516.400000000001
more energy they have that energy from

5514.3 --> 5519.159000000001
the Beyond

5516.4 --> 5521.379999999999
that thing that lasts forever until the

5519.159 --> 5525.0
end of time and then whatever's next is

5521.38 --> 5525.0
next or maybe it all ends

5529.84 --> 5533.1990000000005
it's interesting to think about the

5531.4 --> 5536.879999999999
table yeah Richard G but I mean I've

5533.199 --> 5536.879999999999
known that about ghosts for a long time

5537.52 --> 5543.639
like I was a medium I was I was the guy

5540.88 --> 5546.88
that would check out spooky ghost houses

5543.639 --> 5550.3
and then was like what is here I'm that

5546.88 --> 5551.86
guy I'm that guy that does like

5550.3 --> 5554.7390000000005
who is here

5551.86 --> 5557.099999999999
and I did that and I even had like

5554.739 --> 5557.099999999999
people

5557.62 --> 5565.48
that I I successfully like

5561.88 --> 5567.400000000001
like got the spooky ghosts out got the

5565.48 --> 5569.379999999999
haunting out of the house that they

5567.4 --> 5571.839999999999
moved into

5569.38 --> 5573.52
and even identified some things about

5571.84 --> 5576.52
what

5573.52 --> 5580.540000000001
what apparently led up to that effect

5576.52 --> 5582.88
being there like I was that kind of guy

5580.54 --> 5586.06
I'm not like actively doing it I'm not

5582.88 --> 5588.88
like oh I'm the spooky investigator guy

5586.06 --> 5591.159000000001
nothing like that but I mean I will just

5588.88 --> 5593.62
do that if I get anywhere and it rarely

5591.159 --> 5596.259999999999
happens anyway I will always like a new

5593.62 --> 5598.9
place okay so how cursed is this place

5596.26 --> 5601.96
is it haunted what is coming past here

5598.9 --> 5604.36
like what energy is being deposited here

5601.96 --> 5607.179
continually by the people

5604.36 --> 5610.719
where is their Consciousness at on

5607.179 --> 5614.9400000000005
average like what is the real system

5610.719 --> 5617.9800000000005
the energy and Consciousness rail system

5614.94 --> 5620.98
within this building

5617.98 --> 5623.98
right all these things that's what I

5620.98 --> 5626.62
that's what I busy myself with

5623.98 --> 5630.178999999999
like always

5626.62 --> 5630.179
I can't stop doing that

5634.38 --> 5639.82
I used to be an exorcist yeah

5638.62 --> 5642.94
but

5639.82 --> 5645.82
I was never really super successful with

5642.94 --> 5647.44
actually exercising possessed people but

5645.82 --> 5650.32
that's also because I didn't really

5647.44 --> 5652.0599999999995
understand the nature of possessed

5650.32 --> 5656.5
people and that

5652.06 --> 5659.9800000000005
you can't get somebody to get to stop

5656.5 --> 5662.26
being possessed if they didn't want to

5659.98 --> 5664.659
because there's people out there that

5662.26 --> 5666.88
were like I'm possessed help me they

5664.659 --> 5668.92
didn't one they didn't want me to

5666.88 --> 5670.96
actually take it away they just wanted

5668.92 --> 5674.08
attention

5670.96 --> 5676.4800000000005
and they were actually possessed but

5674.08 --> 5678.04
they didn't want to let it go yeah like

5676.48 --> 5679.839999999999
people they're like oh help me I feel

5678.04 --> 5681.159
terrible I got possessed and then I

5679.84 --> 5682.900000000001
would try to help them

5681.159 --> 5684.879999999999
and they would feel pretty good about it

5682.9 --> 5688.0599999999995
but then they'd like

5684.88 --> 5691.2390000000005
it's still here it's like

5688.06 --> 5694.3
but why

5691.239 --> 5697.0599999999995
don't you want to to go don't you want

5694.3 --> 5699.34
to let this go do you want to move on it

5697.06 --> 5701.1
would just say to my face no and then

5699.34 --> 5705.639
like yeah

5701.1 --> 5709.26
I if you don't want to let it go I can't

5705.639 --> 5709.26
make you let it go

5710.08 --> 5717.04
and you know that it's like you have to

5713.5 --> 5720.28
decide to let it go you can't be forced

5717.04 --> 5724.6
you could break somebody you could like

5720.28 --> 5727.96
torture somebody in order to break to

5724.6 --> 5731.08
basically dominate them over their

5727.96 --> 5733.06
possession possessive influence to force

5731.08 --> 5735.58
them to let it go but then you literally

5733.06 --> 5739.179
have an even more broken person

5735.58 --> 5742.6
after that so it's pointless

5739.179 --> 5745.2390000000005
you can't force somebody

5742.6 --> 5747.400000000001
to stop being possessed if they really

5745.239 --> 5750.58
don't want to if they consciously don't

5747.4 --> 5754.36
want to it doesn't work they have to do

5750.58 --> 5757.44
it and it's a loss to them you see when

5754.36 --> 5757.44
you have that in you

5758.32 --> 5764.44
it is really something that you long for

5762.219 --> 5766.4800000000005
you don't want to let it go it's like

5764.44 --> 5769.839999999999
demons

5766.48 --> 5772.36
it's always for your experience a

5769.84 --> 5776.08
terrible thing to see a demon go from

5772.36 --> 5780.28
your spirit realm why because they

5776.08 --> 5781.239
transform so much pain into pleasure for

5780.28 --> 5785.08
you

5781.239 --> 5787.54
they provide you energy in that sense

5785.08 --> 5790.78
and if you then have to be Noble and let

5787.54 --> 5793.12
it go it's all ugly you only get ugly in

5790.78 --> 5795.219
return so it's like some it's not

5793.12 --> 5798.219
appealing to let go of a demon it's a

5795.219 --> 5801.52
real sacrifice that's the real [ __ ]

5798.219 --> 5804.1
sacrifice letting go of the demon yeah

5801.52 --> 5805.179
and that's where most people are just

5804.1 --> 5808.4400000000005
too weak

5805.179 --> 5808.4400000000005
they just don't do it

5821.62 --> 5827.219
do you think it was an animal I don't

5824.38 --> 5827.219
know what did you see

5828.28 --> 5832.54
when you're Black's getting your bedroom

5830.26 --> 5833.62
door opening laughing at you when you

5832.54 --> 5835.36
were eight

5833.62 --> 5838.62
oh okay

5835.36 --> 5838.62
yeah that could have been a witch

5839.139 --> 5843.2390000000005
that sort of thing happened with me all

5840.94 --> 5843.239
the time

5843.4 --> 5850.12
I literally had freaking beautiful

5845.92 --> 5853.0
looking but terrible terrible

5850.12 --> 5854.5599999999995
women that were older than me like I was

5853.0 --> 5857.62
like eight

5854.56 --> 5860.4400000000005
and I would have like them

5857.62 --> 5863.44
in my freaking dream come to me and they

5860.44 --> 5866.919999999999
would literally try to convince me to

5863.44 --> 5869.98
sacrifice myself for some greater glory

5866.92 --> 5872.9800000000005
yeah and I thought at first it's like Oh

5869.98 --> 5874.299999999999
you mean like a hero yeah I want to be a

5872.98 --> 5877.959999999999
hero

5874.3 --> 5880.0
but then later as as that situation in

5877.96 --> 5881.9800000000005
the Dark World progressed further which

5880.0 --> 5885.54
wasn't in one single go in night

5881.98 --> 5885.54
consciously it was like in between

5885.82 --> 5890.38
eventually it turned out that no they

5888.1 --> 5893.08
actually were trying to convince me to

5890.38 --> 5896.1990000000005
literally have myself sacrificed in some

5893.08 --> 5901.0199999999995
[ __ ] ritual okay

5896.199 --> 5901.0199999999995
yeah I've I've had some encounters

5901.3 --> 5905.9800000000005
I've never seen those women in the

5903.94 --> 5909.099999999999
physical world though they might have

5905.98 --> 5911.678999999999
seen me but I I never consciously met

5909.1 --> 5913.780000000001
them or I forgot about it

5911.679 --> 5918.659
and which is something that they can do

5913.78 --> 5918.659
to you you can make you forget them

5919.12 --> 5923.62
because real witches are [ __ ] creepy

5921.4 --> 5928.36
especially to Little Children very

5923.62 --> 5932.26
dangerous like keep them away from your

5928.36 --> 5935.0199999999995
children I mean really no joke no

5932.26 --> 5937.84
Superstition [ __ ] you really need to

5935.02 --> 5940.5
keep them away because they'll [ __ ] with

5937.84 --> 5940.5
their dreams

5940.9 --> 5945.638999999999
and I don't mean their conscious things

5943.48 --> 5948.5199999999995
that they like to perceive pursue I mean

5945.639 --> 5951.159000000001
literally in their dreams

5948.52 --> 5952.96
in their sleeping experience you keep

5951.159 --> 5955.299999999999
them away

5952.96 --> 5957.58
give the satanists away from your

5955.3 --> 5962.639
children it's [ __ ] dangerous

5957.58 --> 5962.639
anyway how do we identify as a witch

5963.219 --> 5970.32
how do you identify what the [ __ ]

5965.88 --> 5970.32
there's nothing to do with identify

5972.1 --> 5978.34
which is just a catch-all phrase in this

5974.56 --> 5981.34
case it was a woman that was like very

5978.34 --> 5981.34
non-Christian

5984.34 --> 5991.5
that dealt in evil practices obviously a

5989.199 --> 5991.5
witch

6006.38 --> 6011.3
took you've been talking to tell you of

6009.179 --> 6011.3
course

6011.699 --> 6015.239
but I mean

6013.139 --> 6016.92
it all depends on what that even means

6015.239 --> 6019.44
to them you know

6016.92 --> 6021.84
I mean you can be like a Witchy Witch

6019.44 --> 6023.879999999999
which is just kind of like oh yeah I'm

6021.84 --> 6026.219
just into this sort of style and think

6023.88 --> 6028.92
witches aren't necessarily bad there's

6026.219 --> 6032.58
just like the witches that just like to

6028.92 --> 6035.6990000000005
have the seasonal celebrations and that

6032.58 --> 6039.0599999999995
are just very much about nature and the

6035.699 --> 6042.96
elements perhaps right it's a style

6039.06 --> 6045.06
like that's a witch too it's like

6042.96 --> 6047.4
they're about the seasons and about

6045.06 --> 6051.38
herbs and about

6047.4 --> 6051.379999999999
oh yeah that sort of thing right

6053.4 --> 6058.92
that's not necessarily evil like

6056.94 --> 6063.0
that doesn't automatically mean that

6058.92 --> 6066.42
they're into like sacrifice and like

6063.0 --> 6070.159
Dream Magic and domination and mind

6066.42 --> 6070.159
control that's different

6072.36 --> 6077.0599999999995
this weekend difference being which no

6077.1 --> 6080.6
we can is like the

6080.639 --> 6083.6990000000005
the modernization

6084.48 --> 6088.919999999999
of like the old

6087.54 --> 6091.44
with yeah the old

6088.92 --> 6094.38
[Music]

6091.44 --> 6097.5599999999995
paganism you could say

6094.38 --> 6100.639
seasonal celebrations

6097.56 --> 6100.639
herb lore

6101.159 --> 6105.42
that sort of thing Wiccan is just the

6103.86 --> 6108.5
modernized

6105.42 --> 6108.5
version of that

6109.139 --> 6114.900000000001
but I mean wika is also very much

6112.44 --> 6117.98
connected up with like Freemasonry and

6114.9 --> 6117.98
Satanism so

6122.4 --> 6130.219
it's not I wouldn't recommend it

6126.239 --> 6130.218999999999
I would not recommend weka

6135.739 --> 6141.86
even though I did it myself for a while

6138.719 --> 6141.86
sort of

6142.38 --> 6149.1
I did some things I I had like an altar

6145.02 --> 6151.26
and stuff but I would just make it be

6149.1 --> 6154.139
like symbolic and energy I was a lot

6151.26 --> 6157.159000000001
about crystals still am but I mean very

6154.139 --> 6157.159000000001
actively back then

6175.8 --> 6180.96
they look like meth heads

6178.38 --> 6184.1990000000005
destroys your well look Flair Sage if

6180.96 --> 6186.36
they're going to be like a freaky witch

6184.199 --> 6189.0599999999995
like doing extremely unhealthy things

6186.36 --> 6191.639
like eating corpses and all that and

6189.06 --> 6193.8
yeah yeah that will [ __ ] you up all

6191.639 --> 6196.5
right

6193.8 --> 6201.38
if you do [ __ ] up things it will [ __ ]

6196.5 --> 6201.38
you up yeah that typically happens

6220.38 --> 6225.78
if you're just gonna do like egregious

6222.84 --> 6227.9400000000005
witchcraft for Satan basically do more

6225.78 --> 6230.34
and more horrible things

6227.94 --> 6234.0599999999995
and that's not really witchcraft that's

6230.34 --> 6237.06
just [ __ ] Satanism and Satanism as I

6234.06 --> 6240.360000000001
said is tied into it like that doesn't

6237.06 --> 6242.6990000000005
mean that every 15 year old like oh I

6240.36 --> 6245.4
like to do kind of Harry Potter stuff I

6242.699 --> 6247.619
think that's cool I like to make ritual

6245.4 --> 6249.599999999999
like full of rituals for the fun to just

6247.619 --> 6252.179
celebrate Mother Nature like there's

6249.6 --> 6254.280000000001
nothing really wrong with that except

6252.179 --> 6255.179
for Christians how dare you I don't give

6254.28 --> 6257.3
a [ __ ]

6255.179 --> 6260.82
yeah

6257.3 --> 6263.1
get your logic straight first before you

6260.82 --> 6264.54
criticize anything else out there and I

6263.1 --> 6265.8
mean anything

6264.54 --> 6267.3
right

6265.8 --> 6269.88
but uh

6267.3 --> 6271.860000000001
yeah that's not necessarily Satanism it

6269.88 --> 6273.84
becomes Satanism when you're like oh I

6271.86 --> 6276.119
want to see more I want to see more I

6273.84 --> 6279.42
want to do more I want more power I want

6276.119 --> 6282.36
the more respect oh Satan is oh yeah

6279.42 --> 6285.78
sure who doesn't you become a Satanist

6282.36 --> 6288.36
then start eating corpses and [ __ ] and

6285.78 --> 6291.0
[ __ ] up things and

6288.36 --> 6293.699
Oaths

6291.0 --> 6295.86
to the devil and who knows what the [ __ ]

6293.699 --> 6298.379999999999
it all is I don't want to talk about it

6295.86 --> 6300.42
really but that's just Satanism now

6298.38 --> 6302.88
you've just become from a Wicca and like

6300.42 --> 6305.28
oh look the spiritual nature of things

6302.88 --> 6308.9400000000005
too like ah let's [ __ ] it all up let's

6305.28 --> 6311.699
see how far you will go how far will you

6308.94 --> 6314.659
torture your own spirit for power yeah

6311.699 --> 6314.659
that's satanism

6315.239 --> 6318.299999999999
has nothing to do with witchcraft

6317.219 --> 6321.3
anymore

6318.3 --> 6324.92
although in the olden days they would

6321.3 --> 6324.92
just call witchcraft that

6325.08 --> 6330.239
yeah in the olden days they didn't call

6328.739 --> 6334.159
satanism

6330.239 --> 6334.159
Satanism they call it witchcraft

6334.619 --> 6340.739
it's because of like the more Revival of

6338.52 --> 6342.540000000001
all paganism like the realization like

6340.739 --> 6344.5199999999995
yeah maybe Christians persecuted them

6342.54 --> 6346.26
for no reason yeah

6344.52 --> 6348.0
yes they did

6346.26 --> 6351.119000000001
that it was kind of separated like yeah

6348.0 --> 6352.92
which maybe it's not necessarily the

6351.119 --> 6355.739
always evil

6352.92 --> 6358.38
let's call that satanism

6355.739 --> 6360.299999999999
and that's kind of like how that shifted

6358.38 --> 6362.9400000000005
and now we just kind of call that

6360.3 --> 6366.4800000000005
satanists

6362.94 --> 6368.94
it's a witches and to say a certainness

6366.48 --> 6373.699
is a witch that's just kind of an old

6368.94 --> 6373.699
lingo doesn't really work anymore

6375.48 --> 6380.82
right because what we call certain

6378.659 --> 6382.799999999999
things in life

6380.82 --> 6386.699
together what we agree upon to call

6382.8 --> 6389.400000000001
things that shifts over time

6386.699 --> 6391.98
as language and understanding of things

6389.4 --> 6394.32
shift

6391.98 --> 6397.4
so they used to call that witches now we

6394.32 --> 6397.4
call it satanists

6403.86 --> 6410.28
right and it is kind of tricky because

6407.34 --> 6412.38
I was like a when I was into WIC I was

6410.28 --> 6414.9
kind of naughty in the sense that

6412.38 --> 6417.0
like I had bad moods and I had that

6414.9 --> 6419.159
thing where I was like yeah I

6417.0 --> 6421.92
like I'm like a goth and sometimes like

6419.159 --> 6424.44
I just want to like cause Mayhem but not

6421.92 --> 6427.38
like real suffering I just want to cause

6424.44 --> 6429.239
a little man I'm like yeah like

6427.38 --> 6431.159000000001
basically startle the [ __ ] out of people

6429.239 --> 6432.178999999999
for no damn reason because I thought it

6431.159 --> 6434.159
was funny

6432.179 --> 6437.88
and it's not really funny it's kind of

6434.159 --> 6440.9
an [ __ ] thing to do but that's like

6437.88 --> 6442.32
witchy that's like

6440.9 --> 6446.58
[Music]

6442.32 --> 6448.86
right but is that satanic oh the satanic

6446.58 --> 6450.119
is startled me it's so evil no no that's

6448.86 --> 6454.619
just

6450.119 --> 6456.54
it's just cheeky and annoying and

6454.619 --> 6458.88
childish

6456.54 --> 6462.659
and yeah

6458.88 --> 6464.96
not very exemplary right that's that's

6462.659 --> 6467.159
kind of like what you'd expect of some

6464.96 --> 6469.139
teenagers to do that like they're into

6467.159 --> 6470.759999999999
witches they're like startling people or

6469.139 --> 6472.7390000000005
freaking them out or starting their

6470.76 --> 6477.139
really scary stories or something

6472.739 --> 6477.138999999999
because they're like yeah I just wanna

6477.199 --> 6483.659
Express that

6479.699 --> 6485.5199999999995
I don't fit in no societal mold

6483.659 --> 6487.739
I'm gonna do this [ __ ] I'm gonna do that

6485.52 --> 6491.400000000001
[ __ ] I'm gonna do whatever I want right

6487.739 --> 6493.678999999999
but if you then really get into that and

6491.4 --> 6496.619
you do it too much and you're like yeah

6493.679 --> 6499.679
I actually really hate Society

6496.619 --> 6502.38
I want to destroy Society I'm gonna join

6499.679 --> 6505.86
with stupid protests uh how I hate

6502.38 --> 6509.28
humanity and uh and maybe I'll like get

6505.86 --> 6511.5
into like anti-human Cults and oh wow

6509.28 --> 6513.599999999999
wow that's a lot of that wow look at all

6511.5 --> 6516.119
these people oh they're saying that that

6513.6 --> 6517.26
you can actually make money from that oh

6516.119 --> 6520.5
wow

6517.26 --> 6521.58
oh abortion industry huh right well

6520.5 --> 6524.239
that's

6521.58 --> 6526.739
where it turned from and that cheeky

6524.239 --> 6528.839999999999
cheeky witches that are just [ __ ]

6526.739 --> 6532.218999999999
around and scaring people for the fun of

6528.84 --> 6535.8
it where that changes into genuine

6532.219 --> 6539.46
anti-human Satanism yeah it can it can

6535.8 --> 6542.52
turn into that but it's on the person

6539.46 --> 6546.42
are you gonna like really

6542.52 --> 6549.0
cut off all ties with God and and Human

6546.42 --> 6551.58
Nature

6549.0 --> 6554.4
or are you just kind of growing out of

6551.58 --> 6556.98
that teenage type rebellious face which

6554.4 --> 6558.839999999999
can last very long it can last like half

6556.98 --> 6561.119
your life you can just have that in you

6558.84 --> 6562.860000000001
and it's not going to come out but if

6561.119 --> 6565.92
you let that side

6562.86 --> 6569.719
slide further into the real darkness now

6565.92 --> 6569.719
then you're [ __ ] now you're Satanist

6572.34 --> 6574.88
see

6584.84 --> 6588.2390000000005
I hope you guys understand what I'm

6587.159 --> 6591.32

highlights and then I can check it out

6651.42 --> 6654.6
and don't do that all the time by the

6653.76 --> 6657.320000000001
way

6654.6 --> 6657.320000000001
uh

6668.34 --> 6671.88
oh you did actually do that didn't

6670.199 --> 6673.5
Darwin other scientist maybe both

6671.88 --> 6675.6
independent come up with the theory of

6673.5 --> 6676.619
revolutions which is someone like them

6675.6 --> 6682.1
on again

6676.619 --> 6682.099999999999
did could be could be more colored

6685.8 --> 6690.860000000001
I mean Darwin was into some occult [ __ ]

6690.9 --> 6696.42
but yes I mean there dude I have a

6694.139 --> 6698.04
theory and it's partially based on my

6696.42 --> 6700.26
own experience

6698.04 --> 6702.48
that a lot of these

6700.26 --> 6705.179
like Marxist

6702.48 --> 6706.199
even like the style of the we have these

6705.179 --> 6709.92
theories

6706.199 --> 6712.678999999999
are actually from extra dimensionals

6709.92 --> 6715.38
they're not made by humans

6712.679 --> 6718.26
there's entities on the other side in

6715.38 --> 6720.96
the Dark World in the astral Realm

6718.26 --> 6723.42
that bring you these ideas

6720.96 --> 6727.619
I've seen it

6723.42 --> 6731.179
rep not a reptilian but an insectoid

6727.619 --> 6731.179
I've seen insectoids

6731.3 --> 6737.04
that literally I would ask so like oh

6734.52 --> 6739.619000000001
yeah okay so you're

6737.04 --> 6743.1
you're the they would be called the

6739.619 --> 6744.54
aliens for some reason I don't know why

6743.1 --> 6746.76
and it would talk to them it's like okay

6744.54 --> 6750.119
so what do you want and they would

6746.76 --> 6753.719
literally start rolling out some [ __ ]

6750.119 --> 6756.659
up standard sjw [ __ ]

6753.719 --> 6759.7390000000005
and I'm like no

6756.659 --> 6763.638999999999
no you can't be seriously saying that

6759.739 --> 6763.638999999999
that's so [ __ ] dumb

6763.98 --> 6768.678999999999
and they didn't really respond to that

6770.219 --> 6776.04
but I really think that a lot of this

6772.38 --> 6778.619
[ __ ] up sjw are these ideas and

6776.04 --> 6780.9
evolution and a lot of these types of

6778.619 --> 6783.139
ideas come from entities on the other

6780.9 --> 6783.138999999999
side

6785.28 --> 6792.92
that people like Dar Darwin would then

6788.82 --> 6795.54
in yeah deal with on drug trips probably

6792.92 --> 6797.88
on Ayahuasca or something and then he

6795.54 --> 6800.46
got this entity and he's like hey yeah

6797.88 --> 6803.219
I want to figure out it's like oh you

6800.46 --> 6806.159
hate God too yeah yeah no it says Darwin

6803.219 --> 6807.4800000000005
yeah I do hate God she's an [ __ ]

6806.159 --> 6809.759999999999
right

6807.48 --> 6812.58
and so like yeah I want to figure out

6809.76 --> 6814.9800000000005
like how the Origin of Species works

6812.58 --> 6818.58
well since you already said that God

6814.98 --> 6820.619
that you hate God well let's make up

6818.58 --> 6823.44
something or maybe it just didn't even

6820.619 --> 6826.799999999999
say it's just like yeah well one species

6823.44 --> 6830.28
can turn into another species

6826.8 --> 6831.659000000001
and Darwin would be like huh

6830.28 --> 6833.88
yeah

6831.659 --> 6836.82
yeah why not

6833.88 --> 6838.8
yeah we could kind of make that work

6836.82 --> 6841.44
and then the entity would say like yeah

6838.8 --> 6843.719
just look at the different stages

6841.44 --> 6845.759999999999
of the fetal development

6843.719 --> 6848.04
and then you can see how the evolution

6845.76 --> 6850.619000000001
works

6848.04 --> 6853.32
there would be like huh

6850.619 --> 6855.0599999999995
yeah yeah yeah yeah that's a pretty cool

6853.32 --> 6856.139
idea

6855.06 --> 6858.42
right

6856.139 --> 6861.02
so that's Pro yeah that could be the way

6858.42 --> 6861.02
that it happened

6862.619 --> 6870.239
a lot of these like evil atheist types

6867.119 --> 6874.88
ideas have come from these extra

6870.239 --> 6874.879999999999
dimensional entities in my opinion

6875.4 --> 6879.659
with a limited first-hand experience of

6878.82 --> 6882.719
that

6879.659 --> 6884.58
of those entities that were clearly not

6882.719 --> 6887.82
human in origin

6884.58 --> 6890.219
and what like communicate in a very

6887.82 --> 6893.099999999999
unnatural way too like even the way they

6890.219 --> 6896.88
talk was almost robotic

6893.1 --> 6900.42
like they talked like an sjw talks like

6896.88 --> 6903.0
unnatural like it doesn't feel human

6900.42 --> 6905.88
when they roll out their chanting

6903.0 --> 6907.679
well that's how it literally talked and

6905.88 --> 6911.58
it would just chant that [ __ ] and I'm

6907.679 --> 6914.28
like what the [ __ ] man like who who you

6911.58 --> 6916.44
can't seriously expect people to be dumb

6914.28 --> 6920.639
enough to fall for that [ __ ]

6916.44 --> 6922.98
said I with my Supreme ignorance

6920.639 --> 6924.96
because it turns out that a gigantic

6922.98 --> 6927.659
amount of people fell for that [ __ ]

6924.96 --> 6930.5
and even worse even worse than what I

6927.659 --> 6930.5
got to hear from it

6933.3 --> 6940.56
right but it's all stemming from oh so

6936.42 --> 6944.82
so you so you hate God too do you

6940.56 --> 6947.34
well here's a lot of ideas we got

6944.82 --> 6950.34
and that's kind of how they operate

6947.34 --> 6952.38
it's it's basically Satan it's it's just

6950.34 --> 6954.96
Lucifer there on the other side's like

6952.38 --> 6957.2390000000005
oh yeah we'll be entertaining you'll

6954.96 --> 6959.94
hear oh you hate God too oh yeah yeah

6957.239 --> 6961.86
he's a bastard doesn't he oh yeah I got

6959.94 --> 6964.5599999999995
all these great ideas about all these

6961.86 --> 6965.88
ideas yeah they're really modern

6964.56 --> 6967.679
um

6965.88 --> 6970.1990000000005
yeah

6967.679 --> 6971.34
I mean the way I'm describing it right

6970.199 --> 6974.04
now

6971.34 --> 6976.08
I I actually think that that's real

6974.04 --> 6978.239
that's really there

6976.08 --> 6980.78
that's how a lot of people got these

6978.239 --> 6983.5199999999995
crazy ideas

6980.78 --> 6985.5599999999995
energetics the interface with spirits on

6983.52 --> 6989.820000000001
the other side those Spirits are very

6985.56 --> 6992.639
unnatural and inhuman they hate God and

6989.82 --> 6996.239
have all these ideas

6992.639 --> 6999.92
that we're all getting to experience

6996.239 --> 7002.78
so yes you could say that Marxism

6999.92 --> 7004.4800000000005
Evolution a lot of these ideas have

7002.78 --> 7009.34
actually been

7004.48 --> 7009.339999999999
divined from demons

7010.88 --> 7016.219
I'm dead serious

7013.76 --> 7018.280000000001
yeah

7016.219 --> 7021.7390000000005
Marxist ideas

7018.28 --> 7023.86
Evolution probably climate change all

7021.739 --> 7028.0599999999995
that yeah it's probably

7023.86 --> 7028.0599999999995
divined from demons

7030.199 --> 7033.58
I'm dead serious

7034.28 --> 7036.699
anyway

7036.94 --> 7042.5
man I've been rambling today

7040.82 --> 7044.9
I can't believe two hours have already

7042.5 --> 7048.159
passed

7044.9 --> 7048.159
but yeah I'll keep going

7049.92 --> 7056.42
[Music]

7053.36 --> 7059.179
bitten Darwin steal the idea upstairs of

7056.42 --> 7063.04
course he did what else they always

7059.179 --> 7063.04
steal everything so yeah

7063.679 --> 7071.32
yeah

7066.04 --> 7071.32
Darwin was like a real serious Grappler

7076.82 --> 7083.38
ramble win

7079.46 --> 7083.38
that's not very nice thing to say

7085.34 --> 7090.46
I don't think I've been just rambling

7087.739 --> 7090.459999999999
uselessly

7097.34 --> 7103.119000000001
cost dealing the postulates

7100.4 --> 7103.119
did he

7104.179 --> 7107.54
yeah he kind of did didn't he it wasn't

7105.98 --> 7110.78
his postulas

7107.54 --> 7112.76
but then he used those passages

7110.78 --> 7115.28
to claim

7112.76 --> 7118.280000000001
his case for bacteria

7115.28 --> 7122.0599999999995
being infectious

7118.28 --> 7125.0599999999995
but he also used the postulates

7122.06 --> 7125.06
fraudulently

7125.54 --> 7133.58
so he both steals stole it

7129.38 --> 7134.84
then misapplied it and then

7133.58 --> 7138.639
like

7134.84 --> 7138.639
claimed it as his own

7143.239 --> 7146.5599999999995
yeah that's pretty messed up

7153.26 --> 7157.76
yeah Marcola yeah no I I've heard of it

7155.96 --> 7159.139
before I've heard that Darwin did

7157.76 --> 7161.719
actually

7159.139 --> 7165.08
like interface with demons

7161.719 --> 7167.36
with occult practices and drugs

7165.08 --> 7170.119
I've heard that before

7167.36 --> 7174.679
and it does not surprise me because well

7170.119 --> 7177.44
I've been through that sort of

7174.679 --> 7178.9400000000005
I mean I didn't like go a few times oh

7177.44 --> 7180.86
let's try it and communicate with the

7178.94 --> 7182.299999999999
spirit so use the drug communicate with

7180.86 --> 7184.28
no I went through all other

7182.3 --> 7185.78
differentiate I went through this giant

7184.28 --> 7188.119
vision

7185.78 --> 7190.699
that like was throughout my life it's

7188.119 --> 7192.5599999999995
like this parallel universe Timeless

7190.699 --> 7194.36
experience where you just like get to

7192.56 --> 7196.400000000001
see things from the future in the past

7194.36 --> 7197.719
and like it's crazy because you don't

7196.4 --> 7199.4
know

7197.719 --> 7200.659
that it's even happening when it's

7199.4 --> 7203.0
happening you don't know that it's

7200.659 --> 7205.879999999999
different from The Real World

7203.0 --> 7208.159
you have to figure that out afterward

7205.88 --> 7211.900000000001
when it's happening I didn't know that

7208.159 --> 7211.9
it wasn't physical reality

7212.9 --> 7216.799999999999
it would only after it happened that I

7215.179 --> 7218.84
could think about it and then realize

7216.8 --> 7221.42
that's not physically real I don't have

7218.84 --> 7225.5
any memory of how I got to that point

7221.42 --> 7227.84
and where I went to after it

7225.5 --> 7230.659
no arrival and

7227.84 --> 7232.639
and leave leaving points so it must have

7230.659 --> 7236.86
been not physically real

7232.639 --> 7236.86
but while it's happening you can't tell

7237.38 --> 7241.2390000000005
anyway that's my experience

7243.8 --> 7248.360000000001
what's that oh yeah yeah right anyway I

7246.8 --> 7250.719
gotta take two minute break I'll be

7248.36 --> 7250.719
right back

7321.199 --> 7324.199
foreign

7397.46 --> 7402.94
thank you

7399.46 --> 7402.94
and I'm back

7433.94 --> 7436.839999999999
okay

7441.39 --> 7444.609
[Music]

7452.119 --> 7455.719
do you find it interesting stories of

7454.04 --> 7458.719
people

7455.719 --> 7461.42
that deny God but not Satan and demons

7458.719 --> 7464.179
yeah they're [ __ ] [ __ ]

7461.42 --> 7467.599
I mean those people are genuinely

7464.179 --> 7471.52
[ __ ] you're so [ __ ] denialist

7467.599 --> 7471.52
[ __ ] it's unbelievable

7474.679 --> 7478.179
it's unbelievable

7487.4 --> 7492.879999999999
Nathan's computer must have died yes it

7490.4 --> 7492.879999999999
kind of did

7494.119 --> 7499.759999999999
a pretty severe collapse

7497.659 --> 7502.5199999999995
I just kept replacing things and

7499.76 --> 7504.7390000000005
replacing things and it's just like

7502.52 --> 7506.9800000000005
well it might be working again this

7504.739 --> 7506.98
Monday

7529.96 --> 7534.46
Feb yesterday no not a live one

7536.179 --> 7542.139
classical thinker yeah hey dude did I

7539.96 --> 7543.86
call it or what

7542.139 --> 7546.139
seriously

7543.86 --> 7547.28
but I think even Nathan realized that

7546.139 --> 7550.88
now

7547.28 --> 7553.94
I mean I gave him a pretty Stern warning

7550.88 --> 7555.38
like uh I've seen this before this never

7553.94 --> 7559.82
ends well

7555.38 --> 7562.04
yeah and that's a guy that's known a lot

7559.82 --> 7564.199
of programmers and people that assemble

7562.04 --> 7566.9
computers yeah

7564.199 --> 7570.379999999999
when I say tinkering

7566.9 --> 7572.78
is that happens until you you break your

7570.38 --> 7575.36
computer you know it's fixed yeah you

7572.78 --> 7578.54
keep fixing it until it's broken that

7575.36 --> 7580.58
that like always happens it really

7578.54 --> 7582.32
always does and I warned him about it

7580.58 --> 7585.4
and he just kept going and going and

7582.32 --> 7585.4
going and now yeah

7586.58 --> 7593.239
well at least I think he's actually

7590.3 --> 7595.46
learned from the experience

7593.239 --> 7597.98
so I just hope he's not gonna keep doing

7595.46 --> 7600.02
this over and over and over again

7597.98 --> 7601.5199999999995
like oh I just got a new computer and

7600.02 --> 7603.4400000000005
then oh I'm gonna Tinker it again and

7601.52 --> 7605.780000000001
then oh it's gonna get all the same [ __ ]

7603.44 --> 7608.48
again I have to replace this but it's

7605.78 --> 7611.36
gonna keep going and going go Nathan

7608.48 --> 7615.32
should definitely catch on at some point

7611.36 --> 7617.179
that like this is not durable

7615.32 --> 7621.699
I don't want to Tinker the rest of my

7617.179 --> 7621.6990000000005
life no matter how good I get at it

7627.139 --> 7630.9400000000005
what the hell you guys talking about

7634.46 --> 7638.9800000000005
never met anyone in so many computer

7636.32 --> 7638.98
problems

7639.56 --> 7644.2390000000005
[Music]

7649.58 --> 7654.0199999999995
well usually if somebody had that kind

7651.98 --> 7657.759999999999
of computer problems they wouldn't talk

7654.02 --> 7657.76
to the entire world about it

7658.4 --> 7664.179
they'd just be kind of embarrassed and

7660.619 --> 7664.179
try to figure it out for themselves

7672.1 --> 7675.669000000001
[Music]

7681.38 --> 7687.099
computer moonshots and by proxy the [ __ ]

7689.92 --> 7694.3
that's one way of thinking about it

7712.099 --> 7717.02
best of the best fastest yeah no Mark I

7715.219 --> 7719.06
totally agree

7717.02 --> 7721.76
I don't like that kind of setup at all

7719.06 --> 7727.119000000001
like for me like oh Fest is the fastest

7721.76 --> 7727.119000000001
no no I want the most efficient

7727.88 --> 7733.159000000001
as possible like I want efficient I

7730.46 --> 7736.099
don't want fastest because I don't want

7733.159 --> 7738.5599999999995
to run super fast [ __ ]

7736.099 --> 7742.159000000001
only thing that that does is just make

7738.56 --> 7745.34
you waste more energy on newer programs

7742.159 --> 7747.379999999999
that actually suck

7745.34 --> 7748.9400000000005
oh it's more flashy oh it's oh it's

7747.38 --> 7751.6990000000005
better graphic it looks more real yeah

7748.94 --> 7754.82
but it also sucks more

7751.699 --> 7757.159
huh and it costs more electricity which

7754.82 --> 7759.32
is like three times as expensive as it

7757.159 --> 7762.5
used to be is that really worth it no it

7759.32 --> 7767.0
isn't no it is not

7762.5 --> 7769.04
I just want really efficient computers

7767.0 --> 7771.44
like I have a graphics card in my

7769.04 --> 7772.159
computer right now that doesn't have a

7771.44 --> 7775.098999999999
fan

7772.159 --> 7778.28
yeah it's passive

7775.099 --> 7782.96
and when I bought it it was like

7778.28 --> 7786.139
an old chipset that was like revamped

7782.96 --> 7788.3
into like this or rather

7786.139 --> 7790.52
yeah it was like an in-between version

7788.3 --> 7793.76
of it like you have all these oh super

7790.52 --> 7795.080000000001
big ass blocks with the giant fans on

7793.76 --> 7796.400000000001
them they get really hot and they're

7795.08 --> 7798.679
really heavy and they're like super

7796.4 --> 7801.199
hyped up yeah well I like to take one

7798.679 --> 7803.599
that's literally passive that doesn't

7801.199 --> 7805.839999999999
have an active fan in it and it works

7803.599 --> 7805.84
great

7808.159 --> 7814.239
it wasn't even that expensive at the

7810.32 --> 7814.239
time I mean my graphics card is

7815.659 --> 7824.32
how old is it when did I

7819.679 --> 7824.32
uh when I replace that last

7829.699 --> 7835.04
is it still that card

7832.699 --> 7838.04
wow this card this my graphics card

7835.04 --> 7840.92
could could be 12 years old

7838.04 --> 7841.76
yeah I've got a 12 year old graphics

7840.92 --> 7845.1990000000005
card

7841.76 --> 7845.1990000000005
that works great

7850.699 --> 7856.159
yeah and I even run like multiple 3D

7853.82 --> 7857.239
games on it and yeah it starts blowing

7856.159 --> 7859.879999999999
then

7857.239 --> 7862.718999999999
but it works great which GPU how the

7859.88 --> 7862.719
hell should I know

7867.92 --> 7873.4400000000005
you mean the GPU of my computer of my my

7871.46 --> 7876.5
own processor

7873.44 --> 7879.219
I don't know that [ __ ] I know I got like

7876.5 --> 7879.219
a quad core

7881.36 --> 7887.42
I run on

7884.42 --> 7887.42
64-bit

7888.139 --> 7893.32
oh I don't even what is that freaking

7890.9 --> 7893.32
check

7897.87 --> 7901.14
[Music]

7901.699 --> 7906.04
s it how do I check that

7907.099 --> 7909.6990000000005
now

7911.54 --> 7914.739
that's right here

7915.98 --> 7923.19
control panel

7919.44 --> 7923.19
[Music]

7923.3 --> 7928.2390000000005
computer status no [ __ ] ah

7930.76 --> 7937.360000000001
performance information yeah that's not

7933.8 --> 7937.360000000001
super helping ah

7942.26 --> 7950.5
when did I last run this

7945.92 --> 7950.5
31 10 20 22.

7951.619 --> 7956.44
now

7953.06 --> 7956.4400000000005
uh hold on

7967.159 --> 7969.82
what

7976.82 --> 7979.54
oh

7981.04 --> 7986.139
uh sorry guys I'm just

7992.96 --> 7998.92
at the system details yeah I think this

7996.199 --> 7998.919999999999
is the right one

8001.239 --> 8006.718999999999
now I just have to find

8003.82 --> 8006.719
CPU

8011.679 --> 8017.02
okay

8014.02 --> 8017.02
components

8024.88 --> 8027.42
no

8041.5 --> 8047.56
I think I have to like restart my

8043.9 --> 8050.799999999999
computer in the Bios look at it

8047.56 --> 8052.84
I can't find it here

8050.8 --> 8055.119000000001
it's always a hassle to try to find

8052.84 --> 8057.719
anything about your computer in in

8055.119 --> 8057.719
Windows

8083.619 --> 8089.32
right I'm looking

8085.84 --> 8094.4400000000005
just at my computer's activity and 25 to

8089.32 --> 8094.44
30 percent of my CPU is being used

8095.8 --> 8103.079000000001
but I still don't know which what type

8098.86 --> 8103.079
it is I where the hell do I find that

8125.8 --> 8132.0
oh yeah start system properties

8129.4 --> 8132.0
foreign

8135.94 --> 8139.5599999999995
yeah that didn't help at all

8149.44 --> 8154.54
it's just system okay let's see what

8152.079 --> 8157.259999999999
just oh yeah that did work

8154.54 --> 8157.26
huh

8157.599 --> 8162.46
okay I gotta

8159.579 --> 8165.46
processor is an i5

8162.46 --> 8165.46
4430

8165.52 --> 8172.540000000001
CPU on three gigahertz

8170.139 --> 8175.4400000000005
Intel

8172.54 --> 8175.44
so it's a five

8178.06 --> 8182.46
16 gigabyte memory

8189.82 --> 8193.5
yeah that's the one

8211.84 --> 8214.019
thank you

8214.599 --> 8218.8
of course I don't know what that means

8216.58 --> 8221.019
but I mean you got to realize that this

8218.8 --> 8223.619999999999
is the new motherboard with the new

8221.019 --> 8227.5
processor and the new memory remember

8223.62 --> 8230.979000000001
because my motherboard melted was like

8227.5 --> 8233.62
completely broken last year in January I

8230.979 --> 8236.08
had to get a new computer

8233.62 --> 8238.479000000001
and then replaced the motherboard so

8236.08 --> 8240.76
there's these new this is a new

8238.479 --> 8243.58
processor new memory I don't know

8240.76 --> 8245.800000000001
I didn't pick the this myself

8243.58 --> 8248.2
because the previous setting I had

8245.8 --> 8252.0
literally ordered all that and assembled

8248.2 --> 8252.0
it myself in 2011.

8257.2 --> 8262.240000000002
right anyway it's working fine I have

8260.679 --> 8265.12
nothing to complain about my computer

8262.24 --> 8267.399
except maybe that my monitor

8265.12 --> 8268.84
could be bigger but I mean who gives a

8267.399 --> 8271.84
[ __ ]

8268.84 --> 8274.359
who gives a [ __ ] really like the size of

8271.84 --> 8277.380000000001
your monitor is just not important

8274.359 --> 8277.380000000001
not really

8279.28 --> 8283.679
but it would be cool if I had a bit

8281.26 --> 8283.679
bigger

8295.179 --> 8300.889
that's not bad setup

8297.46 --> 8303.46
seven thirty percent slower

8300.889 --> 8306.518999999998
[Music]

8303.46 --> 8309.88
you like having too much yeah sure I'd

8306.519 --> 8312.179
like that too I just don't have it also

8309.88 --> 8315.518999999998
I don't have the room to put it here

8312.179 --> 8318.12
this is I would have to have a much

8315.519 --> 8318.12
bigger desk

8324.82 --> 8331.979
SSD would yeah but I have an SSD I have

8328.599 --> 8331.979
been using that for quite a while

8335.32 --> 8340.42
and yes NASA is using an SSD for

8338.26 --> 8344.439
practical

8340.42 --> 8346.960000000001
just for practical Computing it's a

8344.439 --> 8349.24
enormous difference between a actual

8346.96 --> 8351.518999999998
hard disk

8349.24 --> 8354.96
which because that [ __ ] thing always

8351.519 --> 8354.960000000001
requires time to spin up

8355.0 --> 8360.519
so I use two discs I have a hard disk

8357.7 --> 8361.84
for my main data dump like everything is

8360.519 --> 8364.24
on there like

8361.84 --> 8369.58
software

8364.24 --> 8372.219
uh like software install stuff is there

8369.58 --> 8375.219
so that I can like go there and install

8372.219 --> 8379.96
it on my actual SSD so I have basically

8375.219 --> 8383.559
a hard disk for data and I have a SSD

8379.96 --> 8385.839999999998
for the boot up and for games like the

8383.559 --> 8387.82
SSD is the place I where I actually

8385.84 --> 8390.399
install the programs I don't install

8387.82 --> 8392.32
programs on my hard disk because then

8390.399 --> 8394.599999999999
every time I'd use them I'd have to like

8392.32 --> 8397.42
wait for my freaking hard disk to start

8394.6 --> 8400.359
up so I install all the programs on the

8397.42 --> 8403.72
SSD so it gets really quick

8400.359 --> 8407.32
and then have the data stored like the

8403.72 --> 8410.679999999998
storage data and even save files on

8407.32 --> 8414.279999999999
the D disk on the hard disk and that

8410.68 --> 8416.5
works fantastic it's so fantastic this

8414.28 --> 8419.2
system that you can literally just

8416.5 --> 8421.42
because if I got these dead two types of

8419.2 --> 8423.7
discs compartmentalized you can

8421.42 --> 8426.52
literally like switch them out

8423.7 --> 8429.7
it's like ah if the new operating system

8426.52 --> 8433.66
the old one is completely dead okay well

8429.7 --> 8436.66
just install on the new SSD you plug it

8433.66 --> 8439.6
in you add the hard disk and it's like

8436.66 --> 8442.359
oh you connect them up and it works

8439.6 --> 8445.479000000001
perfectly like it always did

8442.359 --> 8448.78
I got a system I've been using that type

8445.479 --> 8451.899
of setup for my computer for two decades

8448.78 --> 8454.62
now and working perfectly

8451.899 --> 8454.619999999999
perfectly

8465.34 --> 8469.8
it Linux at six seconds oh that's cool

8488.68 --> 8490.92
foreign

8492.91 --> 8499.03
[Music]

8506.93 --> 8511.879
[Music]

8521.79 --> 8533.36
[Music]

8576.34 --> 8578.880000000001
okay

8588.819 --> 8592.08
ah come on

8623.26 --> 8629.92
yeah okay maybe this title will work

8627.16 --> 8631.899
it's quite a difficult to make it fit

8629.92 --> 8634.859
but I got it to fit in 100 characters

8631.899 --> 8634.858999999999
what do you guys think

8640.06 --> 8647.439
I don't play games while streaming

8642.78 --> 8649.6
well no I mean it definitely requires my

8647.439 --> 8653.380000000001
dude can you imagine that I'd actually

8649.6 --> 8656.16
be paying a game while doing this

8653.38 --> 8656.16
I mean

8657.52 --> 8661.67
that would be that would be so [ __ ]

8660.7 --> 8667.499000000002
boring

8661.67 --> 8667.499
[Music]

8669.78 --> 8675.52
I mean if you really wanted to see that

8672.939 --> 8677.91
then just go to like

8675.52 --> 8681.03
D live or what is it the other one

8677.91 --> 8681.03
[Music]

8681.899 --> 8686.92
I forget the name those platforms where

8684.939 --> 8689.68
it is like everybody's just gaming it's

8686.92 --> 8691.899
like oh he's playing a game and there's

8689.68 --> 8695.08
a chat and it's really [ __ ]

8691.899 --> 8697.779999999999
mortifyingly boring it's like exactly

8695.08 --> 8701.7
that boring with everyone that does that

8697.78 --> 8701.7
I don't understand why people

8701.74 --> 8705.359
truly get that their attention

8707.14 --> 8714.399
but yeah I don't play games during

8711.0 --> 8719.58
my show although sometimes I do have

8714.399 --> 8719.58
like a game active and on autopilot

8720.7 --> 8726.460000000001
in the background

8722.38 --> 8729.16
but I don't play the actual game

8726.46 --> 8730.479
during my live show that would be very

8729.16 --> 8732.46
distracting

8730.479 --> 8734.56
and also I wouldn't be able to like

8732.46 --> 8736.899
you'd hear that you would hear the

8734.56 --> 8741.24
sounds of it very annoying or I'd have

8736.899 --> 8741.24
to turn the sound of the entire game off

8742.78 --> 8747.78
I do sometimes play games during fed

8745.42 --> 8747.78
though

8748.359 --> 8753.76
when Brian's having like an hour talk

8750.88 --> 8755.5
about some maths of the the map or

8753.76 --> 8758.08
something because it's like

8755.5 --> 8760.18
yeah it can't really contribute to that

8758.08 --> 8762.64
conversationalize so I'm just like gonna

8760.18 --> 8766.62
play a game in the background or

8762.64 --> 8766.619999999999
or go out for groceries or something

8777.34 --> 8781.08
do you love it when Brian does that

8781.3 --> 8785.46
I mean he is pretty good at what he does

8785.56 --> 8789.939
it's just

8787.0 --> 8793.6
it's just freaking math

8789.939 --> 8794.979000000001
I'm just not a big fan not a big fan of

8793.6 --> 8797.439
math

8794.979 --> 8799.619999999999
what he's new what he knows what he's

8797.439 --> 8799.62
doing

8806.74 --> 8809.399
what

8818.68 --> 8824.460000000001
oh I'm a deal what are you talking about

8821.08 --> 8824.46
what are you guys talking about

8824.95 --> 8829.719000000001
[Music]

8832.14 --> 8835.41
[Music]

8860.8 --> 8865.08
think of me with glasses yeah

8872.26 --> 8875.22
I agree

8875.56 --> 8879.779999999999
or just you on camera

8879.819 --> 8886.26
might be kind of cool

8881.68 --> 8886.26
I'd love to see you like talk

8887.439 --> 8890.819
just to see what it's like

8918.64 --> 8924.76
gpus handle higher resolutions yeah but

8921.939 --> 8927.819
it's not about the GPU my color the gpus

8924.76 --> 8929.74
your general processor isn't

8927.819 --> 8932.08
really meant

8929.74 --> 8935.5
to deal with that

8932.08 --> 8938.02
Mysterio graphics card is meant to deal

8935.5 --> 8940.5
with higher resolutions and multiple

8938.02 --> 8940.5
screens

8943.899 --> 8949.899
we're not coming on cam I never said you

8947.68 --> 8954.479000000001
had to come on a cam

8949.899 --> 8954.479
just go on the camera anyway

8957.819 --> 8962.58
who is graphic okay fair enough yeah

8959.8 --> 8962.58
graphics card

8963.1 --> 8966.939
yeah if you have multiple screens you

8965.38 --> 8970.438999999998
need

8966.939 --> 8970.439
you need a good graphics card

8970.479 --> 8972.96
but

8973.54 --> 8976.2
hmm

8988.72 --> 8993.34
right

8990.76 --> 8995.92
anyway still sorry to hear that you

I mean

9144.899 --> 9149.18
it's just like a really intense

9150.18 --> 9152.84

someone's Voice besides YouTube no not

9194.819 --> 9197.0
really

9198.359 --> 9204.84
but I mean you could just like

9200.58 --> 9207.84
drop audio files like in Skype

9204.84 --> 9211.02
people do that regularly especially QE

9207.84 --> 9214.14
it just like makes a little recording

9211.02 --> 9217.26
and you just throw the the audio file in

9214.14 --> 9222.74
the Skype and anybody can listen

9217.26 --> 9222.74
oh okay this dank has a link there

9242.16 --> 9244.7
foreign

9297.08 --> 9300.62
upload okay

9301.12 --> 9304.239000000001
[Music]

9307.979 --> 9313.08
yeah when it comes to audio stuff I use

9310.38 --> 9316.58
audacity it's a pretty good editing

9313.08 --> 9316.58
thing very smooth

9317.46 --> 9319.88
you

9329.04 --> 9333.26
know audacity right

9340.22 --> 9345.599999999999
of his Junior set goes that's a good

9343.14 --> 9347.88
time to swear that's complete hard [ __ ]

9345.6 --> 9350.460000000001
though slow my moon buggy

9347.88 --> 9352.14
I mean just look at how many people in

9350.46 --> 9355.8
Israel

9352.14 --> 9359.039999999999
like they got screwed with like the

9355.8 --> 9361.279999999999
like the Jabs like one of the worst in

9359.04 --> 9361.28
the world

9361.859 --> 9366.800000000001
so that just doesn't make any damn sense

9363.899 --> 9366.8
if you said that

9378.479 --> 9381.979
cat jumped out of the window

9382.56 --> 9385.16
damn

9396.56 --> 9400.279999999999

machine

9428.819 --> 9434.3
at least he has been now he's saying I I

9431.76 --> 9437.7
guess he has a slightly better

9434.3 --> 9440.16
advisors on what to say now but I mean

9437.7 --> 9443.12
he said a lot of really [ __ ] stupid

9440.16 --> 9443.119999999999
things in the past

9483.84 --> 9488.72
yeah MLP as he probably means ethnic

9487.38 --> 9490.279999999999
ethnically

9488.72 --> 9493.38
ethnically

9490.28 --> 9497.24
ethically sparing you is like wow man

9493.38 --> 9497.24
that's so by that going

9497.52 --> 9504.12
like the virus would have like a sense

9502.319 --> 9506.34
of ethics

9504.12 --> 9508.439
and basically choose not to infect

9506.34 --> 9510.24
certain people because they were Jews

9508.439 --> 9513.6
what

9510.24 --> 9515.52
so yeah they probably mean ethnic

9513.6 --> 9519.380000000001
am appeal

9515.52 --> 9519.380000000001
otherwise it would be really weird

9533.34 --> 9538.5
be many talking about Target I don't do

9536.04 --> 9540.6
anything based on genetics yeah and

9538.5 --> 9541.979
nothing like that has ever actually

9540.6 --> 9543.06
happened

9541.979 --> 9544.438999999998
yeah

9543.06 --> 9549.3
I mean

9544.439 --> 9551.880000000001
ethnic groups are being targeted

9549.3 --> 9554.88
but not like with diseases it's just

9551.88 --> 9557.58
that they get another type of treatment

9554.88 --> 9559.74
they get another protocol with the

9557.58 --> 9562.02
police they get another protocol in the

9559.74 --> 9563.699999999999
hospital right

9562.02 --> 9566.1
but

9563.7 --> 9569.220000000001
they're not like oh we're unleashing a

9566.1 --> 9571.319
bio weapon oh they only that those

9569.22 --> 9574.319
people get sick of that race or

9571.319 --> 9577.74
something no no like that doesn't even

9574.319 --> 9581.76
exist yeah their entire conception of

9577.74 --> 9585.18
diseases doesn't even exist

9581.76 --> 9588.54
it's all fiction yeah

9585.18 --> 9592.979000000001
all they do is fiction

9588.54 --> 9596.1
yeah they will ethnically Target groups

9592.979 --> 9599.58
with certain policies

9596.1 --> 9603.300000000001
but there is no disease that can spread

9599.58 --> 9607.22
yeah they can't even [ __ ] spray [ __ ]

9603.3 --> 9607.22
and then create a disease

9608.7 --> 9613.859
because there aren't any there's just

9612.0 --> 9618.74
poison

9613.859 --> 9618.74
and people getting sick from Poison

9620.64 --> 9625.019999999999
when if you're going to spray freaking

9622.439 --> 9626.64
poison like that enough to acutely make

9625.02 --> 9628.62
everybody sick well then everything is

9626.64 --> 9629.939
going to suffer nature is gonna suffer

9628.62 --> 9632.220000000001
all life

9629.939 --> 9635.819
animal life insect life it's all gonna

9632.22 --> 9639.08
suffer then it will be very palpable

9635.819 --> 9639.08
that's not happening

9646.2 --> 9650.899000000001
what

9648.0 --> 9650.899
are you talking about

9652.74 --> 9659.0
pretend you have oh Saline

9656.46 --> 9659.0
what

9669.96 --> 9675.858999999999
homunculus yeah yeah what the hell is

9672.84 --> 9675.859
George Sanford talking about

9688.68 --> 9694.2
the company growing babies could be fake

9691.26 --> 9696.359
yeah it probably is fake or it's like a

9694.2 --> 9699.060000000001
thing that can be potentially done but

9696.359 --> 9701.460000000001
they're not doing it

9699.06 --> 9704.76
right the point is you can't just start

9701.46 --> 9707.039999999999
growing babies and then like oh well a

9704.76 --> 9708.6
parent comes and buys one now it has

9707.04 --> 9713.18
human rights

9708.6 --> 9713.18
no so you can't really do that

9718.2 --> 9723.54
you can only start to grow babies like

9721.5 --> 9726.84
like they were

9723.54 --> 9729.62
plants or whatever if if there was no

9726.84 --> 9729.62
human rights

9751.5 --> 9754.399

9858.6 --> 9865.640000000001
super tired yeah okay

9862.02 --> 9865.640000000001
you did sound a bit tired

9903.84 --> 9907.819
coming off tough medication

9908.22 --> 9911.899
no really what what type

9912.66 --> 9917.72
been hurting in what sense that's new

9917.88 --> 9921.319
hope it's not too serious

9921.84 --> 9924.2
okay

9925.439 --> 9929.24
create them yeah

9929.399 --> 9934.199999999999
I wouldn't do be too sure about that I

9931.74 --> 9937.08
mean create them you can just get just

9934.2 --> 9940.460000000001
as addicted to that

9937.08 --> 9940.46
methadone right

9947.22 --> 9951.0
you dude there's only one thing that

9949.26 --> 9954.12
works against that Mark

9951.0 --> 9956.76
and that is it's pure psychology you

9954.12 --> 9960.62
just have to

9956.76 --> 9960.62
force it to disconnect in your mind

9962.24 --> 9967.56
if you're gonna try a replacement you're

9965.28 --> 9969.479000000001
not gonna get rid of the pad the pattern

9967.56 --> 9971.46
so

9969.479 --> 9974.938999999998
but that's a tough one man I mean

9971.46 --> 9976.8
methadone really tough

9974.939 --> 9979.02
there's gonna be quite a struggle

9976.8 --> 9983.42
psychologically

9979.02 --> 9983.42
but I mean it is very doable though

9985.08 --> 9990.5
it is better than being a heroin

9988.08 --> 9990.5
addiction

9990.84 --> 9995.69
that's much tougher to get off

9992.58 --> 9995.69
[Music]

9997.95 --> 10001.52
[Music]

9999.42 --> 10005.02
right willpower is really the only thing

10001.52 --> 10005.02
that works against that sort of thing

10006.38 --> 10013.099999999999
through the willpower like you will also

10009.38 --> 10016.099999999999
like it will reduce the pain

10013.1 --> 10018.56
the pain is kind of like a prostitute

10016.1 --> 10020.479000000001
trying to convince you to get back on

10018.56 --> 10023.359
the pain medication is from the inside

10020.479 --> 10026.96
it's actually your your body that's

10023.359 --> 10029.899000000001
trying to seduce you to do it again

10026.96 --> 10032.599999999999
so [ __ ] up about it so the only thing

10029.899 --> 10035.66
that works is just like no just having

10032.6 --> 10039.92
somebody there like a

10035.66 --> 10041.96
a hot girl that's a stupid prostitute

10039.92 --> 10043.76
[ __ ] it's continually trying to get

10041.96 --> 10045.438999999998
your money right and they'll never leave

10043.76 --> 10047.54
you alone and you can't get rid of them

10045.439 --> 10049.460000000001
you can't get them arrested and you just

10047.54 --> 10051.319000000001
have to live with that following you

10049.46 --> 10054.8
around for a while

10051.319 --> 10056.42
until she really doesn't get to you

10054.8 --> 10057.38
anymore and that's pretty much what it

10056.42 --> 10061.06
is

10057.38 --> 10061.06
to do with that kind of addiction

10062.12 --> 10068.060000000001
just have to use pure will power

10065.66 --> 10069.8
to get through it but then if you do

10068.06 --> 10072.019999999999
that then the pain also goes away

10069.8 --> 10073.34
because the pain is Created from the

10072.02 --> 10075.68
inside

10073.34 --> 10077.42
like that's not a pain that's because of

10075.68 --> 10079.7
the drug it's the pain that your body

10077.42 --> 10080.6
creates to try to convince you to get it

10079.7 --> 10084.460000000001
back

10080.6 --> 10084.460000000001
it's really [ __ ] up how that works

10088.1 --> 10092.140000000001
bad habits for alcohol right

10096.22 --> 10102.34
I died the many one

10099.56 --> 10102.34
like what

10114.319 --> 10117.74
you can suddenly die if you stop with

10116.6 --> 10121.24
yes

10117.74 --> 10121.24
I know Emma feel

10123.5 --> 10128.319
oh [ __ ] you actually died holy [ __ ]

10129.2 --> 10134.380000000001
did you have any like outer body

10131.54 --> 10134.380000000001
experiences

10137.06 --> 10139.6
damn

10143.54 --> 10148.7
foreign

10145.51 --> 10148.7
[Music]

10156.26 --> 10158.859
wow

10171.319 --> 10176.5
did she get any palpable damage from it

10178.819 --> 10184.66
that you noticed that you like had

10182.54 --> 10187.76
certain brain damage or something or or

10184.66 --> 10189.38
maybe it wasn't that long if you're just

10187.76 --> 10193.359
a few minutes

10189.38 --> 10193.358999999999
probably minimize the damage

10193.399 --> 10198.76
but still eight minute it is pretty

10196.22 --> 10198.76
risky

10204.38 --> 10209.8
what is methadone actually for yeah it

10206.899 --> 10209.8
is a pain medication

10211.16 --> 10218.72
it's an opioid it's like a soft opioid

10215.72 --> 10218.72
softer

10222.62 --> 10226.819000000001
but I mean methadone is terrible though

10225.08 --> 10229.46
you get

10226.819 --> 10231.8
a typical side effect from prolonged use

10229.46 --> 10234.199999999999
is that you start to see actual demons

10231.8 --> 10237.5
it literally brings you in into hell my

10234.2 --> 10239.12
mother my mother in her last years when

10237.5 --> 10241.7
she had cancer and all that she got on

10239.12 --> 10242.75
methadone and she'd literally starts

10241.7 --> 10245.720000000001
seeing devils

10242.75 --> 10248.06
[Music]

10245.72 --> 10250.34
and sadly you would talk to her and then

10248.06 --> 10253.46
like she would get all really weird and

10250.34 --> 10255.56
Skitty and it's like she wasn't there

10253.46 --> 10258.679999999998
and she was like in Hell or something

10255.56 --> 10261.14
really [ __ ] up methadone can be really

10258.68 --> 10265.7
creepy

10261.14 --> 10268.34
so yeah most opioids you get that kind

10265.7 --> 10271.1
of weird thing eventually

10268.34 --> 10273.7
I'm very glad I've always avoided pain

10271.1 --> 10273.7
medications

10279.28 --> 10283.720000000001
thank you

10281.6 --> 10283.720000000001
thank you

10285.02 --> 10288.800000000001
hell on Earth all over yeah but it's the

10287.3 --> 10291.08
side effect of it

10288.8 --> 10292.88
it's because it like as suppresses all

10291.08 --> 10295.58
these pains

10292.88 --> 10297.438999999998
and then because you're not to you're

10295.58 --> 10299.84
supposed to experience those things

10297.439 --> 10302.18
there's like a energy feedback thing or

10299.84 --> 10304.34
something that Expresses in the pain of

10302.18 --> 10306.439
sight of cycle of typical pains and

10304.34 --> 10309.380000000001
relief in your body dealing with it and

10306.439 --> 10311.06
if you then subtly turn it off

10309.38 --> 10314.3
then it's like

10311.06 --> 10316.278999999999
an imbalance in your spirit happens and

10314.3 --> 10318.46
it's like Suddenly It's like the devil's

10316.279 --> 10318.460000000001
just

10319.16 --> 10322.88
all of a sudden and then you're in hell

10321.2 --> 10325.279
and it's like ah

10322.88 --> 10327.74
[Music]

10325.279 --> 10330.26
it's really [ __ ] up what that stuff

10327.74 --> 10332.06
does to you

10330.26 --> 10334.58
and you don't get that like the first

10332.06 --> 10337.84
time probably but if you're gonna keep

10334.58 --> 10337.84
using it dude

10343.52 --> 10348.319000000001
but you probably know some about that

10345.62 --> 10351.34
Mark alert am I anywhere close did you

10348.319 --> 10351.34
experience things like that

10354.56 --> 10358.58
or you don't want to remember I I

10356.6 --> 10360.880000000001
wouldn't blame you to try not to think

10358.58 --> 10360.88
back

10362.72 --> 10365.438999999998
foreign

10369.8 --> 10375.199999999999
weird things yeah

10372.14 --> 10377.479
but weird dark things right

10375.2 --> 10380.060000000001
it's weird it's chaotic

10377.479 --> 10383.479
it's like hysterical

10380.06 --> 10385.72
it's like this mad things start to

10383.479 --> 10385.72
happen

10388.279 --> 10392.24
did you ever get like you're talking

10390.08 --> 10394.7
with somebody and suddenly you're like

10392.24 --> 10396.979
without realizing you're you're falling

10394.7 --> 10398.779
into a Daydream where they suddenly do

10396.979 --> 10402.039999999999
like ah

10398.779 --> 10402.04
have you ever had that

10407.42 --> 10412.58
startled the [ __ ] out of you

10410.54 --> 10416.319000000001
I've heard people that experience that

10412.58 --> 10416.319
sort of thing drove them insane

10431.12 --> 10437.54
I suggest the heroin addict quits huh

10434.66 --> 10438.92
well cold turkey

10437.54 --> 10441.439
probably

10438.92 --> 10444.08
and I mean if it's actual full-on

10441.439 --> 10447.859
addiction then maybe

10444.08 --> 10450.74
maybe Kratom but the problem is is that

10447.859 --> 10452.479000000001
it's just one step after you gotten off

10450.74 --> 10456.08
the heroin or whatever you go on the

10452.479 --> 10458.479
Kratom now you are definitely gonna get

10456.08 --> 10461.18
addicted to Kratom you see that's the

10458.479 --> 10462.699999999999
problem so then you have to get off that

10461.18 --> 10465.62
so

10462.7 --> 10467.66
from what I heard and I've known people

10465.62 --> 10471.439
like

10467.66 --> 10474.26
in town where there was one coffee shop

10471.439 --> 10477.26
I knew the coffee shop owner there

10474.26 --> 10481.04
yeah it's an interesting diet three

10477.26 --> 10483.5
pretty cute looking daughters and blonde

10481.04 --> 10486.080000000002
daughters and he had a coffee shop and

10483.5 --> 10488.899
he used to be a heroin addict who what

10486.08 --> 10490.819
got off it completely but even he said

10488.899 --> 10492.08
like yeah it's just cold turkey it's the

10490.819 --> 10496.699999999999
only way

10492.08 --> 10499.16
this you can't just really deflect it

10496.7 --> 10502.939
it's you just have to go through that

10499.16 --> 10505.399
hell and then just by all means

10502.939 --> 10508.04
necessary to prevent yourself from

10505.399 --> 10509.72
slipping back in

10508.04 --> 10511.399000000001
because if you're going to take

10509.72 --> 10514.88
something else you're just going to get

10511.399 --> 10517.899
addicted to that thing in the same way

10514.88 --> 10517.899
that's what I heard

10523.96 --> 10527.179999999998
[Music]

10525.2 --> 10529.479000000001
I'll ask you I have here okay that's

10527.18 --> 10529.479000000001
cool

10530.12 --> 10533.899000000001
that's a lot but I mean if it works for

10532.16 --> 10537.92
you that's great but the problem is

10533.899 --> 10540.439
you're gonna still get addicted to that

10537.92 --> 10542.6
it's gonna happen and how will you get

10540.439 --> 10544.399
off that right so if you just keep

10542.6 --> 10546.439
jumping from one thing to the other

10544.399 --> 10549.76
you're not really quitting you're just

10546.439 --> 10549.76
migrating your drugs

10551.24 --> 10557.42
it's almost it feels like oh I'm

10554.3 --> 10560.24
quitting smoking cannabis oh really yeah

10557.42 --> 10562.399
because I smoke a different strain of

10560.24 --> 10564.14
cannabis every time and it's completely

10562.399 --> 10567.199999999999
different every time yeah but just

10564.14 --> 10571.24
you're still smoking I mean that's not

10567.2 --> 10571.240000000002
getting off it you know not really

10582.02 --> 10587.300000000001
wean yourself down yeah but it's very

10584.12 --> 10589.52
tough though to win down with pain

10587.3 --> 10591.619999999999
because if you wean yourself down it

10589.52 --> 10593.24
doesn't work like if you just give

10591.62 --> 10595.279
yourself half the dose because you're

10593.24 --> 10597.319
weaning down it's almost better to just

10595.279 --> 10599.300000000001
not do anything

10597.319 --> 10601.519999999999
because it's just not gonna work at all

10599.3 --> 10603.14
then and that's why Cold Turkey is

10601.52 --> 10605.18
probably better

10603.14 --> 10608.18
there's this stuff you can like put

10605.18 --> 10610.220000000001
yourself in a coma for a while

10608.18 --> 10613.819
to basically get through the cold turkey

10610.22 --> 10615.92
phase which can be extremely painful

10613.819 --> 10618.26
so you can basically coma your way

10615.92 --> 10623.62
through it works for

10618.26 --> 10623.62
for heroin it works for what is it

10623.899 --> 10628.599999999999
format for meth addiction

10634.34 --> 10636.880000000001
okay

10637.64 --> 10641.5
Suboxone I don't know what that is

10644.96 --> 10650.3
oh that's good that's very lucky Marco

10647.6 --> 10653.300000000001
that you just were able to quit smoking

10650.3 --> 10656.06
for some people smoking can be very very

10653.3 --> 10659.08
brutally tough to quit my dad had so

10656.06 --> 10659.08
much trouble with that

10660.14 --> 10666.019999999999
it's like he had to quit forever because

10662.899 --> 10667.939
like it was just too dangerous to like

10666.02 --> 10669.439
get re-addicted now he just thinks it's

10667.939 --> 10671.479000000001
disgusting

10669.439 --> 10673.76
good for him

10671.479 --> 10675.38
but I mean can be very difficult to get

10673.76 --> 10677.6
over that

10675.38 --> 10680.179999999998
but it's just sometimes other types they

10677.6 --> 10682.880000000001
have no problem with it at all

10680.18 --> 10685.6
I guess you're a bit lucky

10682.88 --> 10685.599999999999
more color

10689.84 --> 10694.22
wow

10691.7 --> 10695.42
I've been going for three hours now

10694.22 --> 10698.899
again

10695.42 --> 10702.399
another three hour show

10698.899 --> 10702.399
I have a lot of those these days

10706.899 --> 10714.46

10710.3 --> 10714.46
yeah I'm gonna ground out the show soon

10737.96 --> 10740.679999999998
foreign

10740.69 --> 10746.66
[Music]

10743.439 --> 10748.460000000001
where's all the FED Super Chat money I

10746.66 --> 10752.3
don't know it's not here

10748.46 --> 10755.438999999998
not I don't take Super Chat though but I

10752.3 --> 10755.438999999998
do take paypals

10755.54 --> 10760.300000000001
I could definitely use that

10757.7 --> 10760.300000000001
guys

10761.3 --> 10765.16
if you like longer show yeah me too

10769.58 --> 10774.16
why would we [ __ ] on you more call it I

10771.979 --> 10774.16
mean

10774.38 --> 10781.479
you went through a tough time and you

10777.38 --> 10781.479
yeah you're still dealing with that

10781.819 --> 10786.039999999999
I mean it's just the rate that you got

10783.56 --> 10786.039999999999
out of it

10790.64 --> 10796.64
yeah I mean it's not the only one I mean

10793.819 --> 10800.84
did you know that Neil also he knew used

10796.64 --> 10805.278999999999
to be a heroin addict way back

10800.84 --> 10809.319
and he got out of it too so I mean yeah

10805.279 --> 10809.319000000001
it happens it happens to the best of us

10813.979 --> 10819.438999999998
I mean I never got addicted to that [ __ ]

10817.16 --> 10822.2
but it's because I was really scared of

10819.439 --> 10823.64
it I was more scared of getting addicted

10822.2 --> 10827.060000000001
to like

10823.64 --> 10828.68
to opioids then I was scared of of pain

10827.06 --> 10831.439
literally

10828.68 --> 10834.5
I'm more scared of opioids than I am

10831.439 --> 10836.42
scared of pain you understand so yeah

10834.5 --> 10838.279
well when you're have that kind of

10836.42 --> 10840.26
arrangement in your mind you're not

10838.279 --> 10842.54
gonna get addicted to it because I'm

10840.26 --> 10844.960000000001
scared shitless of it I was like no no

10842.54 --> 10844.960000000001
don't

10846.319 --> 10849.319
laughs

10851.779 --> 10855.92
ah

10853.64 --> 10858.58
That's Sports oh thanks fibroids yeah I

10855.92 --> 10858.58
appreciate that

10858.62 --> 10863.42
right but I mean I'm still smoking you

10861.56 --> 10864.979
know I'm still smoking cannabis for a

10863.42 --> 10867.859
very long time and I'm still smoking

10864.979 --> 10870.938999999998
tobacco even though I swore to myself

10867.859 --> 10875.42
when I was younger that I would quit

10870.939 --> 10877.64
permanently after 30 and am 43 and I'm

10875.42 --> 10879.979
still smoking and

10877.64 --> 10881.84
well I'm not as worried about it as I

10879.979 --> 10884.899
used to be because I used to think like

10881.84 --> 10887.779
if you continue that you will die I was

10884.899 --> 10889.76
like yeah you have to stop it because I

10887.779 --> 10892.52
will die and now I'm like

10889.76 --> 10895.04
yeah maybe just all those [ __ ] things

10892.52 --> 10897.68
that we were taught were just all

10895.04 --> 10900.279
horseshit as in like absolutely

10897.68 --> 10900.279
everything

10901.54 --> 10906.7
absolutely everything yeah

10904.279 --> 10910.58
disease

10906.7 --> 10912.92
disease-wise it's all horseshit all this

10910.58 --> 10916.58
thing oh you get this and that yeah [ __ ]

10912.92 --> 10918.979
you no I don't think you get sick from

10916.58 --> 10921.92
tobacco at all

10918.979 --> 10922.819
you might get sick from the tar of it a

10921.92 --> 10925.16
bit

10922.819 --> 10928.479
but I mean I have a good filter I don't

10925.16 --> 10928.479
feel like it's killing me

10929.0 --> 10934.58
right

10931.46 --> 10937.339999999998
I mean it's ridic just look at the

10934.58 --> 10939.26
Western World wow this cloud is Jesus

10937.34 --> 10941.54
This Cloud is big

10939.26 --> 10943.7
there's some rain gonna fall out of that

10941.54 --> 10946.52
wow man it feels like there's literally

10943.7 --> 10948.76
like an island floating over it's that

10946.52 --> 10948.76
dark

10952.04 --> 10955.720000000001
that's a freaking cloud

10956.479 --> 10961.119999999999
can you see that

10958.22 --> 10964.72
see the contrast

10961.12 --> 10964.720000000001
that's a cloud

10973.16 --> 10976.539999999999
gravity broke

10978.08 --> 10983.359
it's like it feels and like these veils

10981.62 --> 10985.939
underneath there's like this Veil

10983.359 --> 10987.979000000001
underneath the big cloud and has this

10985.939 --> 10991.06
massive contrast

10987.979 --> 10991.06
looks amazing

10991.64 --> 10996.8
it's literally like a big Shadow over

10993.979 --> 10998.84
you I could still see the sun reflecting

10996.8 --> 11001.3
off the clouds in the distance it seems

10998.84 --> 11003.899
for pretty spectacular looking

11001.3 --> 11003.899
anyway

11005.74 --> 11011.34
yeah as I was saying I think it's kind

11008.26 --> 11011.34
of ridiculous that

11012.58 --> 11018.46
that smoking has been banned everywhere

11015.58 --> 11020.8
oh it's smoking bad smoking bad smoking

11018.46 --> 11022.599999999999
bad bad smoking bad oh look at all the

11020.8 --> 11025.66
[ __ ] you could get from smoking it's

11022.6 --> 11028.0

sterile it's all [ __ ] horseshit it's

11031.54 --> 11036.34
all lies

11033.16 --> 11038.56
that's all lies

11036.34 --> 11040.960000000001
is literally psychosomatically

11038.56 --> 11043.68
indoctrinating you yeah

11040.96 --> 11049.679999999998
so where are these

11043.68 --> 11049.68
labels on the [ __ ] drinks yeah

11050.08 --> 11056.2
I mean

11051.7 --> 11058.319000000001
yeah drinking literally gets you liver

11056.2 --> 11061.779
cirrhosis I mean that's still a

11058.319 --> 11064.06
regularly occurring thing that happens

11061.779 --> 11066.34
to a lot of people in the world where's

11064.06 --> 11069.819
the labels for that yeah why don't you

11085.66 --> 11091.779
okay all this [ __ ] that you get from

11089.38 --> 11094.72
smoking it's hard [ __ ] you don't get

11091.779 --> 11096.880000000001
that from smoking yeah you get that from

11094.72 --> 11100.119999999999
medical intervention

11096.88 --> 11102.539999999999
yeah and from eating terrible terrible

11100.12 --> 11102.54
food

11105.04 --> 11111.18
and from personal neglect and hard drugs

11111.52 --> 11117.34
yeah that's where you get those [ __ ]

11114.16 --> 11119.92
up things from that that they put in

11117.34 --> 11121.779
your face on the stupid

11119.92 --> 11125.08
tobacco

11121.779 --> 11126.7
pouches well this torture [ __ ] oh that's

11125.08 --> 11127.779
gonna happen to you it's all [ __ ]

11126.7 --> 11130.54
lies

11127.779 --> 11133.6
yeah none of those people none of those

11130.54 --> 11136.240000000002
wounds that you get to see

11133.6 --> 11138.819
those disgusting photos yeah

11136.24 --> 11142.359
like I wanna I wanna make a bet with you

11138.819 --> 11144.58
that like zero of those photos were

11142.359 --> 11146.92
actually from people that got that from

11144.58 --> 11150.52
smoking yeah those are all people that

11146.92 --> 11154.06
had like Advanced diseases and [ __ ] and

11150.52 --> 11156.52
unhealthy habits yeah those people you

11154.06 --> 11158.859
see on it that show you the score of

11156.52 --> 11163.060000000001
their long operation yeah guess what

11158.859 --> 11165.18
they look fat and blobish and unhealthy

11163.06 --> 11169.6
skin so I bet they don't eat very well

11165.18 --> 11172.0
huh you never see lean people they're

11169.6 --> 11174.34
like damn it I'm bleeding I'm strong I

11172.0 --> 11176.859
eat healthy but if it only happened

11174.34 --> 11178.92
smoke that I wouldn't have or lung

11176.859 --> 11181.66
cancer no that never [ __ ] happens

11178.92 --> 11184.38
yeah you don't see those you get to see

11181.66 --> 11187.119999999999
the weird Blobby

11184.38 --> 11189.519999999999
degenerated people that got really

11187.12 --> 11192.1
[ __ ] up bodies and have to get these

11189.52 --> 11193.779
operations and then they say see that's

11192.1 --> 11197.819
what happens to you when you smoke

11193.779 --> 11201.58
[ __ ] lies it's lies

11197.819 --> 11203.979
those people probably didn't even smoke

11201.58 --> 11205.76
and not getting

11203.979 --> 11208.989
it's lies

11205.76 --> 11208.989
[Music]

11213.52 --> 11217.960000000001
although I wouldn't smoke regular

11215.62 --> 11220.779
cigarettes like packages of cigarettes

11217.96 --> 11223.599999999999
with those filters and those types of

11220.779 --> 11225.220000000001
paper there's [ __ ] in that stuff but the

11223.6 --> 11226.960000000001
tobacco itself

11225.22 --> 11230.319
is fine

11226.96 --> 11232.778999999999
right so not buying prefab cigarettes

11230.319 --> 11234.76
but just a little pouch is already a

11232.779 --> 11236.979000000001
better solution even though a lot of

11234.76 --> 11238.899
tobacco out there still has all this

11236.979 --> 11241.84
crap added to it

11238.899 --> 11245.019999999999
and American Spirit is one of the few

11241.84 --> 11247.58
more generic tobacco available types

11245.02 --> 11248.800000000001
that has the least of that

11247.58 --> 11251.62
[Music]

11248.8 --> 11253.96
but it still is not perfect it's not

11251.62 --> 11256.54
like raw Leaf you literally order over

11253.96 --> 11257.679999999998
the Internet that's even better you

11256.54 --> 11259.899000000001
don't get

11257.68 --> 11261.16
cancer and all that [ __ ] from that you

11259.899 --> 11264.599999999999
just don't

11261.16 --> 11268.18
you just don't

11264.6 --> 11270.34
unless you just non-stop smoking all day

11268.18 --> 11272.62
long every day yeah then eventually

11270.34 --> 11274.06
you'll just [ __ ] yourself up because you

11272.62 --> 11277.18
don't give yourself your body enough

11274.06 --> 11280.899
time to regenerate right it's gonna just

11277.18 --> 11284.439
get damaged from not the the ability for

11280.899 --> 11286.84
the lack of time to regenerate yeah you

11284.439 --> 11289.720000000001
can definitely [ __ ] yourself up that way

11286.84 --> 11291.76
and non-stop smoking non-stop non-stop

11289.72 --> 11293.619999999999
yeah you're gonna [ __ ] yourself up then

11291.76 --> 11296.979
because you don't give your body the

11293.62 --> 11298.84
chance to actually restore all that

11296.979 --> 11300.88
right but if you don't freaking chain

11298.84 --> 11304.0
smoke all day I don't chain smoke all

11300.88 --> 11305.92
day it's just fine

11304.0 --> 11309.22
yeah maybe sometimes you'll be a little

11305.92 --> 11312.88
cough a little coughing or whatever

11309.22 --> 11315.099999999999
and when it's really I don't know

11312.88 --> 11316.72
when it's hard to breathe out there

11315.1 --> 11318.399000000001
because it's really warm and moist or

11316.72 --> 11320.858999999999
something yeah you have a little bit

11318.399 --> 11322.96
more trouble breathing you won't have

11320.859 --> 11324.34
the maximum lung capacity like a

11322.96 --> 11325.899
sportsman

11324.34 --> 11328.06
right

11325.899 --> 11330.58
but there's no freaking guarantee you're

11328.06 --> 11332.979
gonna die from that it's [ __ ]

11330.58 --> 11336.399
there's people over a hundred years old

11332.979 --> 11338.699999999999
in Indonesia right now that smoke every

11336.399 --> 11338.699999999999
day

11339.04 --> 11344.140000000001
and they still don't have lung cancer

11342.279 --> 11347.979000000001
and they smoke since they were like

11344.14 --> 11350.439
eight yeah a person over a hundred years

11347.979 --> 11354.119999999999
old that smoked since they were eight

11350.439 --> 11356.979000000001
and they're still fine

11354.12 --> 11361.08
it's horseshit

11356.979 --> 11361.08
yeah it doesn't kill you

11362.38 --> 11370.438999999998
and freaking big tobacco played into it

11366.399 --> 11370.439
yeah dick tobacco

11371.14 --> 11375.599999999999
actually defended it reasonably

11375.88 --> 11380.8
yeah what if back tobacco in their

11378.399 --> 11383.26
defense against the anti-tobacco lobby

11380.8 --> 11385.179999999998
was just right

11383.26 --> 11386.800000000001
problem though is that big tobacco

11385.18 --> 11389.439
always is working with freaking

11386.8 --> 11391.899
chemicals so they're chemical additives

11389.439 --> 11395.16
yeah they are probably partially the

11391.899 --> 11395.16
cause of diseases

11395.38 --> 11399.119999999999
but tobacco isn't

11399.939 --> 11402.84
how about that

11404.14 --> 11407.68
give your body a rig yeah but it's

11405.819 --> 11409.96
really important Ricky G

11407.68 --> 11411.819
and the same thing even goes for Elko if

11409.96 --> 11413.438999999998
you're an alcohol Drinker if you drink

11411.819 --> 11415.84
every day

11413.439 --> 11418.08
then you don't give your body a proper

11415.84 --> 11418.08
break

11418.359 --> 11425.92
yeah it's the the continual use that

11422.5 --> 11427.84
makes it such a ballast on your body

11425.92 --> 11429.16
that's when the when it becomes

11427.84 --> 11431.2
problematic

11429.16 --> 11435.34
that's when it's become a toxic burden

11431.2 --> 11438.279
and that that accumulates it like Stacks

11435.34 --> 11440.76
with other toxic burden influences

11438.279 --> 11440.76
right

11447.22 --> 11452.5
started smoking every day at 12. okay

11449.319 --> 11455.08
it's a little young but

11452.5 --> 11457.42
if 14 right

11455.08 --> 11460.479
well

11457.42 --> 11462.58
for me it yeah I never smoked I was

11460.479 --> 11466.3
never like a tobacco smoker every day

11462.58 --> 11468.16
like poof even at times when I did I'll

11466.3 --> 11471.399
smoke only tobacco and no cannabis

11468.16 --> 11474.34
because that was a period of time

11471.399 --> 11477.34
I wasn't like smoking all the time

11474.34 --> 11480.6
like I'm not a chain smoker side

11477.34 --> 11480.6
I just not like that

11481.12 --> 11484.62
when did you start back up

11485.68 --> 11493.74
well I started back up smoking

11488.38 --> 11493.74
because they just smoking cannabis

11494.439 --> 11498.899
just it just sucked

11501.88 --> 11506.679999999998
for a while I smoked only tobacco and

11504.52 --> 11509.02
then when I met my ex I quit smoking

11506.68 --> 11512.819
because she really hated smoking and it

11509.02 --> 11512.819000000001
was like [ __ ] smoking I want her

11513.16 --> 11516.76
and I did I completely quit for three

11515.56 --> 11519.46
years

11516.76 --> 11523.24
that I was with her and then I kind of

11519.46 --> 11527.259999999998
started back up in 2015

11523.24 --> 11529.72
because smoking cannabis just made me

11527.26 --> 11532.18
feel [ __ ] every time

11529.72 --> 11535.479
and it is a thing like when you smoke

11532.18 --> 11538.12
cannabis pure like that

11535.479 --> 11540.88
it like makes you dumb it just does that

11538.12 --> 11543.1
as an acute effect it's just like you

11540.88 --> 11544.96
just get that doesn't matter how smart

11543.1 --> 11547.720000000001
you are you smoke it pure it just makes

11544.96 --> 11551.199999999999
me feel dumb it's annoying

11547.72 --> 11554.619999999999
or when I put tobacco with it I do not

11551.2 --> 11556.779
have that dumb dumb effect at all

11554.62 --> 11558.819000000001
it's a world of difference and that is

11556.779 --> 11561.220000000001
the reason why I started smoking tobacco

11558.819 --> 11565.0
again it's not because I wanted tobacco

11561.22 --> 11567.46
I weren't a smoker a cigarette no I I

11565.0 --> 11571.0
don't smoke cigarettes I I don't think

11567.46 --> 11574.479
it's nice I don't like it

11571.0 --> 11575.92
I specifically use tobacco to add to the

11574.479 --> 11579.479
cannabis

11575.92 --> 11579.479
it's a world of difference for me

11581.439 --> 11585.399
how expensive is tobacco in the

11583.72 --> 11586.66
Netherlands absurdly they're very

11585.399 --> 11589.3
expensive

11586.66 --> 11590.5
they literally just raised the price by

11589.3 --> 11593.92
a third

11590.5 --> 11596.2
it's now 11 Euros yeah you heard me

11593.92 --> 11599.08
right 11 Euros

11596.2 --> 11600.34
for one of those pouches one of this and

11599.08 --> 11602.76
that's like

11600.34 --> 11606.16
how much is it

11602.76 --> 11608.68
150 grams or something

11606.16 --> 11611.7
one of these standard pouches is 11

11608.68 --> 11611.7
Euros now

11619.24 --> 11628.0
and yes that is I think around 80 to 90

11624.399 --> 11628.0
percent taxes

11634.66 --> 11641.819
2K it's 20 pounds for what 20 pounds for

11638.74 --> 11641.819
20 what does that mean

11645.46 --> 11653.278999999999
it's more than 11 Euros in the UK Jesus

11648.76 --> 11653.279
okay I had no idea was that outrageous

11653.56 --> 11657.34
but I mean it's on purpose guys they are

11656.319 --> 11660.278999999999
like

11657.34 --> 11663.1
forcing tobacco out they're forcing it

11660.279 --> 11665.439
out probably because tobacco actually

11663.1 --> 11667.300000000001
makes you smarter

11665.439 --> 11669.7
that's what it does

11667.3 --> 11672.869999999999
gives you a little Edge

11669.7 --> 11672.87
[Music]

11675.46 --> 11680.16
and give you a little focused that's why

11677.2 --> 11680.16
a lot of people use it

11691.24 --> 11696.52
Jesus

11694.06 --> 11700.84
man that's so overpriced I mean that's

11696.52 --> 11704.08
just absurd like I mean why it why what

11700.84 --> 11706.66
are you gonna do like 99 taxes like oh

11704.08 --> 11709.779
one packet of cigarettes it's only a

11706.66 --> 11711.52
hundred pounds like why not just forbid

11709.779 --> 11713.859
it then if you're gonna make it more

11711.52 --> 11716.859
[ __ ] expensive than like the most

11713.859 --> 11718.84
expensive hard drugs why not just make

11716.859 --> 11723.0
it illegal then it's so ridiculous

11718.84 --> 11723.0
everything about it is stupid

11727.84 --> 11731.52
30 gram yeah

11735.479 --> 11739.5
20 euros man

11746.56 --> 11752.22
right anyway I think I should round up

11748.66 --> 11752.22
the show over three hours

11767.38 --> 11772.679999999998
government lotteries exploit people's

11769.42 --> 11772.68
gambling addiction yeah

11773.62 --> 11778.08
and it's usually very rigged as well

11781.0 --> 11786.279
it's a little bit more popular these

11783.16 --> 11787.84
days yeah well it's very popular with

11786.279 --> 11793.08
the

11787.84 --> 11793.08
people like around 30 and younger

11799.42 --> 11803.319
I mean smoking is kind of a bit

11801.52 --> 11806.7
old-fashioned now

11803.319 --> 11806.699999999999
regular smoking

11807.46 --> 11812.8
hate Vape yeah I don't I'm not a big fan

11810.04 --> 11815.68
either it's very treacherous

11812.8 --> 11817.96
because when I suck on that thing you

11815.68 --> 11820.54
don't feel it going in

11817.96 --> 11823.119999999999
so I can't I don't know how much I'm

11820.54 --> 11825.720000000001
ingest I'm inhaling of it it's very

11823.12 --> 11825.720000000001
treacherous

11828.16 --> 11833.5
like when I'm inhaling a joint I know

11830.68 --> 11837.720000000001
exactly how much I'm inhaling because I

11833.5 --> 11837.72
can feel it because of the temperature

11837.939 --> 11841.14
it's very helpful

11864.939 --> 11869.380000000001
cigar two or three times yeah but that's

11867.399 --> 11871.0
yeah but that's like special celebration

11869.38 --> 11874.14
type

11871.0 --> 11874.14
as more people do that

11875.14 --> 11877.56
right

11883.0 --> 11887.319
yeah

11883.96 --> 11890.22
my kids feel like smoking

11887.319 --> 11893.88
last time I tried one

11890.22 --> 11893.88
I don't even remember

11906.22 --> 11910.539999999999
anyway you guys are like

11908.439 --> 11912.279
rambling on about this I am going to

11910.54 --> 11913.84
round out the show now I I do actually

11912.279 --> 11916.359
wanna

11913.84 --> 11919.18
continue with the rest of my day
