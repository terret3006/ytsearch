335.28 --> 340.71999999999997
like i don't want to

337.44 --> 340.71999999999997
translate that into

341.12 --> 345.759
shouting or anything

343.36 --> 350.039
just want to take it easy and

345.759 --> 350.039
enjoy the weather if i can

353.759 --> 358.88
but yeah i did work wake up a bit

356.0 --> 358.88
restless today

360.56 --> 362.4
right

361.29 --> 364.40000000000003
[Music]

362.4 --> 367.039
anyway for yeah for those that hadn't

364.4 --> 368.96
noticed not like it

367.039 --> 372.31899999999996
spread it around in chats or anything

368.96 --> 374.88
but i was hanging around a 24 7 discord

372.319 --> 379.24
flat earth discord yesterday

374.88 --> 379.24
for for several hours

381.28 --> 385.19899999999996
don't know to how long

383.84 --> 387.19899999999996
but yeah i had all kinds of

385.199 --> 390.08000000000004
conversations there was real it was

387.199 --> 390.08
really interesting

390.319 --> 393.759
it was yeah pretty great hang around

392.72 --> 395.91900000000004
there

393.759 --> 399.28000000000003
some of the guys in there were

395.919 --> 402.15999999999997
part of the letter 24 7 discord for a

399.28 --> 402.15999999999997
very long time

402.639 --> 407.479
but yeah it was just interesting

404.479 --> 407.479
conversations

408.16 --> 413.36
but all kinds of things also spiritual

410.24 --> 413.36
mechanics and all that

417.039 --> 420.84
rv truth said something about me last

419.44 --> 422.4
night oh

420.84 --> 424.63899999999995
jesus

422.4 --> 427.919
what did he say no i didn't see it i

424.639 --> 427.919
don't watch him at all

433.599 --> 438.56
but man i must have triggered him quite

436.24 --> 442.16
a bit

438.56 --> 442.16
he's talking about me now

445.84 --> 450.63899999999995
so let me guess i'm the crazy man or i'm

448.08 --> 454.24
an agent or i'm secretly possessed by

450.639 --> 454.24
the devil or what was it

459.599 --> 463.4
hello by the way pjcnet

465.759 --> 470.56
he just doesn't like me oh okay

468.319 --> 470.56
huh

473.68 --> 476.16
all right

477.28 --> 481.67999999999995
well if i were him i wouldn't like me

479.28 --> 481.67999999999995
either

490.879 --> 495.91900000000004
i mean it's not like i've refrained from

493.52 --> 497.599
commenting about him and his character

495.919 --> 499.12
so

497.599 --> 500.319
i don't know if he ever even noticed

499.12 --> 503.039
that

500.319 --> 505.52000000000004
dude i don't know how if people

503.039 --> 507.28
out there on the scene even pick up on

505.52 --> 510.08
what i do

507.28 --> 510.08
like at all

513.44 --> 518.1590000000001
because yeah i might just be a little

516.64 --> 521.519
bit

518.159 --> 525.2
too off the norm right

521.519 --> 525.2
that makes some people uncomfortable

529.2 --> 533.48
hello by the way flat earth sage

535.56 --> 538.68
[Music]

540.32 --> 544.24
but

541.76 --> 546.399
how did it come up terror 306 did

544.24 --> 548.72
somebody ask about it

546.399 --> 551.279
i mean did he bring it up

548.72 --> 552.24
all by himself like what what's going on

551.279 --> 555.04
how would

552.24 --> 555.04
what was happening

557.68 --> 561.56
hey slow mo moon buggy

565.44 --> 569.6
george sanford and seeking star wars too

571.839 --> 577.8000000000001
someone took my name in chat oh really

574.399 --> 577.8
oh goody

579.12 --> 582.64
no it wasn't me

581.36 --> 585.2
i hope that's

582.64 --> 588.0
abundantly clear like i i wouldn't go

585.2 --> 591.399
there i don't i might i think i've just

588.0 --> 591.399
banned there

594.48 --> 601.48
nathan oakley is the only one he likes

597.2 --> 601.48
nathan oakley does he huh

611.44 --> 615.32
all right fair enough

626.64 --> 632.399
yeah i know p p j c net

629.36 --> 635.12
yeah no rv is a very suspicious

632.399 --> 635.12
character to me

638.16 --> 643.959
like i don't do not trust him in the

640.959 --> 643.959
slightest

668.72 --> 674.279
oh hey jeff gas you were in there too

671.279 --> 674.279
huh

683.92 --> 689.12
oh nathan's posting more flat earth

687.04 --> 691.4399999999999
diplomatics

689.12 --> 695.279
oh let's stay neutral with all the crazy

691.44 --> 698.0790000000001
people that are blatant liars and

695.279 --> 700.399
impulsive egomaniacs

698.079 --> 700.399
sure

700.8 --> 703.8389999999999
why not nathan

715.04 --> 718.8
yeah tara 306 i agree

725.2 --> 730.0400000000001
god yeah flier said this god

730.88 --> 734.16
i tend to forget about those types of

732.88 --> 736.56
things because

734.16 --> 740.6
it's just so embarrassing that he

736.56 --> 740.5999999999999
actually believes that

750.079 --> 753.079
hmm

758.639 --> 764.0790000000001
after he was on with martin

761.92 --> 767.36
right

764.079 --> 770.4799999999999
well the seeking start he's rv had those

767.36 --> 772.16
vibes like way before he went on with

770.48 --> 776.0
martin but yeah that's probably when you

772.16 --> 776.0
witnessed this for the first time live

776.32 --> 781.36
but dude he's always been acting weird

780.079 --> 784.56
like that

781.36 --> 784.5600000000001
like since the start

784.72 --> 789.6800000000001
i mean when the in when the great

787.04 --> 792.3199999999999
infighting really first started what is

789.68 --> 793.12
it in 2016

792.32 --> 795.839
like

793.12 --> 797.92
rv was right the tip of the spear and he

795.839 --> 800.399
freaking prides himself like he thinks

797.92 --> 804.079
he's some kind of an alex jones of a

800.399 --> 804.079
flat earth infighting sometimes

804.48 --> 807.12
guy is

809.76 --> 813.72
it's just bad news

823.36 --> 829.519
but he doesn't like

825.839 --> 833.8800000000001
a person by the sound of their name

829.519 --> 833.88
what's wrong with the sound arwin

842.56 --> 846.4799999999999
that is so

844.72 --> 849.279
superficial

846.48 --> 851.6800000000001
just like what 15 year old girls do

849.279 --> 854.68
among one another when they talk about

851.68 --> 854.68
boys

872.24 --> 876.0790000000001
doesn't have any content there is to

873.92 --> 878.16
poke others well

876.079 --> 879.12
yeah

878.16 --> 882.3199999999999
i mean

879.12 --> 882.32
i have a daily show

882.72 --> 885.279
right

883.6 --> 888.24
and i

885.279 --> 890.48
constantly have to just on the spot try

888.24 --> 891.6
to figure out what to talk about i can

890.48 --> 895.12
do that

891.6 --> 899.1990000000001
i don't always have like oh here's my

895.12 --> 900.32
library of subjects that i can tap into

899.199 --> 902.8
kind of like

900.32 --> 905.519
owen benjamin seems to have sometimes i

902.8 --> 907.5999999999999
think he's probably also improvising it

905.519 --> 910.079
but he does have more

907.6 --> 913.0790000000001
the plethora of things that he can

910.079 --> 913.079
address

917.92 --> 922.7199999999999
so yeah i don't see like why you would

920.16 --> 924.56
have to resort to infighting

922.72 --> 927.5600000000001
when there is always plenty to talk

924.56 --> 927.56
about

935.839 --> 941.0
it gives people names like 10 year olds

942.0 --> 946.399
yeah seeking star wars mean girls indeed

948.079 --> 952.16
it's like the pretty girls that just

950.32 --> 956.0
figured out they're kind of pretty and

952.16 --> 958.399
they definitely don't deserve it

956.0 --> 961.759
they completely abuse that [ __ ] and they

958.399 --> 964.56
get scared and they isolate themselves

961.759 --> 966.8000000000001
and then they just start to gossip about

964.56 --> 970.2399999999999
things at a distance and it's completely

966.8 --> 971.92
out of whack with reality

970.24 --> 973.519
that's what i've seen happen like i've

971.92 --> 975.279
been

973.519 --> 976.88
just like in school

975.279 --> 980.48
right

976.88 --> 983.92
i would just like pay attention to girls

980.48 --> 985.759
at a distance yeah because they

983.92 --> 988.4799999999999
scare scary

985.759 --> 991.1990000000001
i always get nervous or i used to like

988.48 --> 993.6
now i won't get as nervous but

991.199 --> 995.4399999999999
there's always still that effect

993.6 --> 998.32
so i would kind of study them and i just

995.44 --> 1000.8000000000001
noticed that they do that

998.32 --> 1000.8000000000001
just like

1006.72 --> 1011.0400000000001
like a hang around place during breaks

1009.36 --> 1013.92
it would just like

1011.04 --> 1017.12
sit there or stand just talk and blabber

1013.92 --> 1017.12
on about other people

1017.6 --> 1021.12
and sometimes i knew those people and

1019.519 --> 1024.4
then what they said about just didn't

1021.12 --> 1025.52
make any sense

1024.4 --> 1029.439
right

1025.52 --> 1033.28
so actually based that on an experience

1029.439 --> 1033.28
that comparison anyway

1036.799 --> 1041.28
ah oh slow mo moonbug yeah cool you

1039.12 --> 1043.52
heard that yeah that back and forth

1041.28 --> 1046.0
about mandela

1043.52 --> 1048.559
yeah that guy was just

1046.0 --> 1051.12
like oh let's agree they didn't even say

1048.559 --> 1053.52
let's agree to disagree just like okay

1051.12 --> 1055.12
like blatantly like no i'm just going to

1053.52 --> 1056.799
ignore it and then

1055.12 --> 1058.8799999999999
thinking that he could just continue the

1056.799 --> 1061.12
conversation like a baller just caught

1058.88 --> 1065.2
in a fallacy

1061.12 --> 1065.1999999999998
like no that's not okay

1065.679 --> 1070.2800000000002
i went a bit nathan oakley on him

1089.52 --> 1093.32
hey wrath by the way

1099.76 --> 1103.76
dave

1100.96 --> 1106.76
okay turret which dave are you talking

1103.76 --> 1106.76
about

1109.679 --> 1112.679
foreign

1122.16 --> 1125.52
are you still talking about

1125.84 --> 1129.12
like the david weiss

1129.679 --> 1135.0
against professor dave is that what

1131.52 --> 1135.0
you're talking about

1141.36 --> 1145.039
is he called for reno really i didn't

1143.76 --> 1146.96
know that

1145.039 --> 1149.52
okay

1146.96 --> 1153.8400000000001
yeah i i don't listen to him but i have

1149.52 --> 1156.559
i the thing is i remember the face

1153.84 --> 1159.6789999999999
and the way he just sits there and

1156.559 --> 1161.6
just like super arrogant

1159.679 --> 1164.96
type of radiance it just

1161.6 --> 1168.8799999999999
that guy like really repulses me

1164.96 --> 1168.88
and i remember that just like

1169.76 --> 1173.919
at some point i'm just going to like

1172.0 --> 1176.24
immediately see the face and then click

1173.919 --> 1179.2
away not even remember what he's about

1176.24 --> 1181.76
but just through seeing the face i just

1179.2 --> 1184.16
intuit my intuition is like yeah that

1181.76 --> 1186.24
guy is always full of [ __ ]

1184.16 --> 1188.96
like every second is a waste of your

1186.24 --> 1188.96
conscious time

1189.36 --> 1194.3999999999999
like a gag

1190.84 --> 1194.3999999999999
reflexes right

1195.919 --> 1200.0800000000002
but i've probably seen him like way in

1198.08 --> 1201.08
the past doing that [ __ ] too and just

1200.08 --> 1202.799
being like

1201.08 --> 1205.799
mortifyingly

1202.799 --> 1205.799
embarrassing

1216.08 --> 1222.72
okay that's a weird comparison terry

1220.559 --> 1227.24
fine though yeah i still haven't watched

1222.72 --> 1227.24
it i just i can't do it

1240.96 --> 1247.4
oh okay cowop

1243.76 --> 1247.4
from when was that

1253.679 --> 1257.76
that's probably from a couple of years

1255.44 --> 1257.76
ago

1258.64 --> 1263.8400000000001
i haven't heard from modern day debate

1260.559 --> 1263.84
in a long time

1266.08 --> 1271.24
right

1267.44 --> 1271.24
right that makes sense

1276.48 --> 1281.1200000000001
chakras what the [ __ ]

1278.72 --> 1284.08
how can you debunk that

1281.12 --> 1289.2399999999998
that's ridiculous

1284.08 --> 1289.24
like seriously how can you debunk that

1304.96 --> 1310.64
right yeah yeah that makes sense there

1307.76 --> 1310.64
are three or six

1310.72 --> 1314.72
no you need to shower

1312.72 --> 1317.23
right well that's why i just don't watch

1314.72 --> 1324.589
it

1317.23 --> 1324.589
[Music]

1331.36 --> 1334.6
hey crockett

1368.24 --> 1372.88
right well at least i see you guys kept

1370.48 --> 1375.84
busy

1372.88 --> 1375.8400000000001
over the weekend

1388.88 --> 1391.88
yes

1415.12 --> 1421.4399999999998
yeah tear it sounds about right

1418.48 --> 1423.76
i'm really glad i have an intuition

1421.44 --> 1425.2
impulse now that just makes me not watch

1423.76 --> 1427.6
it

1425.2 --> 1430.4
after just a second it's just like that

1427.6 --> 1432.799
guy oh [ __ ]

1430.4 --> 1435.2
you don't want that

1432.799 --> 1437.76
in your consciousness

1435.2 --> 1440.76
trust me

1437.76 --> 1440.76
right

1445.33 --> 1448.47
[Music]

1465.12 --> 1467.1999999999998
right

1466.08 --> 1469.1999999999998
yeah but

1467.2 --> 1471.6000000000001
to be fair you know i i just don't

1469.2 --> 1473.919
understand why people still

1471.6 --> 1476.32
interact with him

1473.919 --> 1479.039
i mean

1476.32 --> 1481.039
after a certain level of like

1479.039 --> 1483.44
global behavior

1481.039 --> 1485.039
terrible behavior that's allowed in with

1483.44 --> 1485.8400000000001
the person

1485.039 --> 1488.48
like

1485.84 --> 1491.1999999999998
it's not gonna make you look better

1488.48 --> 1493.2
interacting with them

1491.2 --> 1494.72
right

1493.2 --> 1497.3600000000001
when somebody's just

1494.72 --> 1498.96
acting like a complete

1497.36 --> 1501.12
it's like

1498.96 --> 1504.88
well when i'm ragewin

1501.12 --> 1506.9599999999998
i don't expect people to be like oh cool

1504.88 --> 1508.5590000000002
he's like that all right

1506.96 --> 1510.559
hey i wanna

1508.559 --> 1512.24
i wanna be on camera with that guy when

1510.559 --> 1515.44
he's like that right

1512.24 --> 1517.919
i get it i get it i am kind of a maniac

1515.44 --> 1521.6000000000001
when i'm like that oh great camera

1517.919 --> 1524.3200000000002
freezing yes of course

1521.6 --> 1524.32
of course

1526.08 --> 1529.48
what a timing

1529.76 --> 1533.36
right

1530.799 --> 1534.8799999999999
but that guy is just terrible

1533.36 --> 1537.1999999999998
every time

1534.88 --> 1540.0
i don't even understand why people will

1537.2 --> 1542.0
go up against him

1540.0 --> 1544.159
thinking like oh yeah but he's wrong

1542.0 --> 1545.76
about things and i can prove that

1544.159 --> 1550.0800000000002
that'll make me look better yeah but you

1545.76 --> 1550.08
went on camera with that guy

1551.84 --> 1554.84
right

1558.799 --> 1564.1589999999999
i mean it's not like oh

1560.88 --> 1565.8400000000001
you're putting yourself next to a

1564.159 --> 1568.72
slightly less

1565.84 --> 1571.1999999999998
intellectually statured person or

1568.72 --> 1573.44
less brave person to make you like seem

1571.2 --> 1575.279
like oh yeah wow he's the brave one he

1573.44 --> 1578.559
is the cool one right

1575.279 --> 1581.039
but to then put yourself right next to a

1578.559 --> 1583.6789999999999
turd with a face on it

1581.039 --> 1586.4
lying and blabbering all day like no

1583.679 --> 1588.5590000000002
that just makes you look like you went

1586.4 --> 1590.799
up against the turret

1588.559 --> 1590.799
right

1590.88 --> 1595.44
i don't understand why they do that

1594.559 --> 1597.6789999999999
like

1595.44 --> 1598.88
if somebody's just utterly disgusting

1597.679 --> 1601.679
then

1598.88 --> 1604.3200000000002
why would you go up against them for any

1601.679 --> 1606.72
reason like even if you could win

1604.32 --> 1608.3999999999999
it just makes you look like you went up

1606.72 --> 1610.4
against a turret right

1608.4 --> 1613.52
it's in a way it's my mistake i made

1610.4 --> 1616.24
with mr sensible because i had kind of

1613.52 --> 1618.1589999999999
forgotten how terrible he can be and i

1616.24 --> 1619.84
thought like oh just have a sort of a

1618.159 --> 1622.0800000000002
neutral conversation that was the

1619.84 --> 1624.559
motivation behind what i was doing then

1622.08 --> 1626.3999999999999
when i figured out during it that he was

1624.559 --> 1630.3999999999999
just trying to [ __ ] me over and play

1626.4 --> 1633.52
stupid sound bites over my comments

1630.4 --> 1636.159
that's when i just kind of like

1633.52 --> 1638.8799999999999
i wish i hadn't done this

1636.159 --> 1641.279
because yeah i might shine through a

1638.88 --> 1642.5590000000002
little bit of interesting info here and

1641.279 --> 1645.76
there

1642.559 --> 1649.6789999999999
but yeah i had to go up against that

1645.76 --> 1652.96
just that pathological lying

1649.679 --> 1655.2
sweaty [ __ ] just so annoying it like i

1652.96 --> 1657.279
wish i hadn't done that because of that

1655.2 --> 1659.3600000000001
reason

1657.279 --> 1660.88
because yeah sure compared to him i'll

1659.36 --> 1664.559
look like a

1660.88 --> 1666.3200000000002
a more civilized person in ways

1664.559 --> 1667.76
especially because i didn't go ragewin

1666.32 --> 1670.0
or anything

1667.76 --> 1672.64
not that it would ever be lured into

1670.0 --> 1675.12
doing that on on the sit in a situation

1672.64 --> 1675.1200000000001
like that

1676.08 --> 1678.24
but

1678.72 --> 1684.72
yeah

1680.88 --> 1684.72
it's not really helping right

1686.48 --> 1690.64
so

1688.08 --> 1694.1589999999999
i don't know maybe maybe it's just me

1690.64 --> 1696.88
maybe it's wrong maybe

1694.159 --> 1699.3600000000001
people are so used to people being [ __ ]

1696.88 --> 1702.0
out there that they don't even

1699.36 --> 1704.1589999999999
have that impulse anymore like oh look

1702.0 --> 1705.679
he's what he thinks he's going up

1704.159 --> 1707.8400000000001
against the turret that makes him look

1705.679 --> 1709.6000000000001
good but they're like yeah everybody's

1707.84 --> 1713.12
turns at least this guy's cleaning up

1709.6 --> 1716.08
the turns maybe it's that effect

1713.12 --> 1718.0
maybe people are just further down

1716.08 --> 1721.0
down the line that i'm

1718.0 --> 1721.0
hoping

1734.72 --> 1740.799
what do you guys think about it

1737.52 --> 1743.36
it doesn't have any value

1740.799 --> 1744.8799999999999
to go up in a live situation against

1743.36 --> 1747.76
people like this

1744.88 --> 1747.7600000000002
professor dave

1748.64 --> 1750.7990000000002
like

1751.52 --> 1756.72
for real i mean other than maybe

1754.32 --> 1759.12
amusement value

1756.72 --> 1762.0
right for us

1759.12 --> 1762.0
for us guys

1763.039 --> 1767.919
is there anything

1765.84 --> 1770.0
amusement value that you could get out

1767.919 --> 1773.1200000000001
of it

1770.0 --> 1776.64
that's a serious question for everyone

1773.12 --> 1776.6399999999999
hello psych bear by the way

1778.0 --> 1781.48
martin yidsum

1799.52 --> 1803.0
hello hello

1812.159 --> 1815.88
right psych bear

1826.559 --> 1828.799
hmm

1834.72 --> 1841.1200000000001
okay pgcnet i didn't know you actually

1838.96 --> 1842.24
went

1841.12 --> 1843.84
on

1842.24 --> 1846.559
on youtube

1843.84 --> 1850.76
with voice and all huh so you are a

1846.559 --> 1850.76
participator cool

1881.679 --> 1883.919
hmm

1886.32 --> 1892.039
yeah that could be jeff got yeah

1889.039 --> 1892.039
probably

1893.679 --> 1898.159
i mean like david weiss isn't like gonna

1896.799 --> 1900.72
come on

1898.159 --> 1903.2
some channel if he were invited

1900.72 --> 1905.44
to sit right next to simon dan for

1903.2 --> 1907.8400000000001
example right because

1905.44 --> 1910.88
pretty sure that dave wise knows about

1907.84 --> 1912.24
simon dan and like how just pathetic he

1910.88 --> 1913.919
is

1912.24 --> 1915.519
and the people he ranks around with or

1913.919 --> 1917.519
like fight to flat earth like he would

1915.519 --> 1919.919
know them

1917.519 --> 1922.96
and maybe he didn't realize that

1919.919 --> 1927.0
professor dave is just about as terrible

1922.96 --> 1927.0
or even worse in ways

1941.919 --> 1944.24
hmm

1947.279 --> 1952.0
all right territories that's sensible

1950.24 --> 1954.559
good that he kept himself under control

1952.0 --> 1954.559
the whole time

1960.32 --> 1965.039
simon dunst is a failure

1962.399 --> 1967.279
you've proven it repeatedly and

1965.039 --> 1967.279
what

1967.519 --> 1972.279
well he has more subs than me

1977.6 --> 1981.84
it's so funny by the way that

1979.76 --> 1984.8799999999999
some of the trolls out there still try

1981.84 --> 1986.799
to shame me over my subs

1984.88 --> 1989.279
that i have so few of them and they

1986.799 --> 1991.6
really think it gets to me

1989.279 --> 1993.2
just because like years ago i had that

1991.6 --> 1995.76
video once like

1993.2 --> 1997.1200000000001
can't i have a thousand subscribers

1995.76 --> 2000.08
which is

1997.12 --> 2003.36
at this point to me that video is really

2000.08 --> 2004.96
just funny now like every time i see i

2003.36 --> 2008.1589999999999
genuinely laugh

2004.96 --> 2010.32
it's not even embarrassing because i was

2008.159 --> 2012.88
really frustrated

2010.32 --> 2015.039
i thought like my entire financial

2012.88 --> 2017.0390000000002
situation is gonna crash

2015.039 --> 2019.679
that's what i thought

2017.039 --> 2023.2
i really needed it

2019.679 --> 2023.2
but it was kind of silly

2025.12 --> 2028.799
uh

2026.64 --> 2030.96
but yeah there's trolls out there that

2028.799 --> 2032.8799999999999
still think like oh then we know if i

2030.96 --> 2035.44
just remind him about that thousand

2032.88 --> 2038.159
subscriber and how pathetic it was oh

2035.44 --> 2040.3200000000002
i'm gonna make him crumble yeah good

2038.159 --> 2043.7600000000002
luck with that

2040.32 --> 2044.96
i just think it's really funny

2043.76 --> 2047.2
now

2044.96 --> 2049.44
i didn't think it was funny like

2047.2 --> 2050.48
the the first few months after that

2049.44 --> 2052.56
happened

2050.48 --> 2055.2
it was embarrassing

2052.56 --> 2057.599
although it did work

2055.2 --> 2060.5989999999997
i did get the subscribers like next day

2057.599 --> 2060.599
so

2060.879 --> 2064.24
but now it's just funny

2071.44 --> 2075.76
yeah pgcnet no yeah professor dave

2074.159 --> 2077.76
suppose isn't really a professor he's

2075.76 --> 2080.639
more like

2077.76 --> 2082.96
a substitute

2080.639 --> 2085.96
professor assistant

2082.96 --> 2085.96
dave

2094.879 --> 2098.48
and yeah

2096.24 --> 2101.4799999999996
the most hilarious part about that is

2098.48 --> 2101.48
that

2103.44 --> 2109.599
they literally fired him

2106.079 --> 2111.3590000000004
because they didn't want him teaching

2109.599 --> 2113.6800000000003
the kids

2111.359 --> 2115.52
that's

2113.68 --> 2117.68
oh

2115.52 --> 2119.839
i mean i'm laughing about it

2117.68 --> 2122.16
but yeah if i would have tried to

2119.839 --> 2124.72
actually go for the teaching profession

2122.16 --> 2126.72
in official schools i'd probably end up

2124.72 --> 2130.0
in the same situation people would think

2126.72 --> 2133.2799999999997
like no you're way too controversial

2130.0 --> 2135.2
we don't want you doing that right

2133.28 --> 2137.44
but with him they did it because of his

2135.2 --> 2139.2
terrible character

2137.44 --> 2141.359
not

2139.2 --> 2143.359
just yeah

2141.359 --> 2144.56
so that's freaking amazing that's

2143.359 --> 2147.359
hilarious

2144.56 --> 2150.32
it's kind of hilarious in a bad way it's

2147.359 --> 2154.88
it's not good to gloat over that

2150.32 --> 2154.88
but it is still kind of funny come on

2155.839 --> 2159.839
so yeah it's more like assistant

2162.64 --> 2168.839
assistant substitute teacher

2165.839 --> 2168.839
dave

2191.04 --> 2194.88
is okay matthew hall

2195.119 --> 2198.079
clever troll

2198.8 --> 2202.5600000000004
isn't that kind of what flatter data

2200.72 --> 2205.2
does

2202.56 --> 2205.2
matthew hall

2212.32 --> 2215.92
and with flatter data it's weird because

2214.16 --> 2217.92
i

2215.92 --> 2221.92
at first i thought that he was kind of a

2217.92 --> 2224.48
global troll but then it turned out that

2221.92 --> 2224.48
he isn't

2226.24 --> 2230.7999999999997
or maybe somewhere in between it just

2228.24 --> 2233.7999999999997
switched sides but didn't change his

2230.8 --> 2233.8
style

2295.52 --> 2299.24
uh anyway

2300.72 --> 2303.72
right

2315.76 --> 2320.96
so yeah who

2317.28 --> 2322.4
in the chat actually did follow

2320.96 --> 2326.2400000000002
uh my

2322.4 --> 2327.92
performance on 24 7 flatter discord i

2326.24 --> 2330.0
had a whole segment talking about the

2327.92 --> 2332.2400000000002
mandela effect

2330.0 --> 2335.599
going up against this guy then insisted

2332.24 --> 2337.4399999999996
it was just as real as flutter

2335.599 --> 2340.7200000000003
and that yeah got

2337.44 --> 2343.839
very annoying to me so i did get a bit

2340.72 --> 2343.839
nathonian on him

2345.25 --> 2348.44
[Music]

2348.96 --> 2352.16
does anybody everybody here already know

2351.359 --> 2353.52
my

2352.16 --> 2355.2799999999997
views on

2353.52 --> 2357.68
the mandela effect

2355.28 --> 2360.48
you want to talk about it maybe not i'm

2357.68 --> 2360.48
just trying to

2360.64 --> 2366.0789999999997
move maneuver a bit towards a technical

2363.92 --> 2368.32
subject instead of having everybody

2366.079 --> 2370.88
focus for half an hour on like the

2368.32 --> 2373.88
terrible characteristics of professor

2370.88 --> 2373.88
dave

2386.48 --> 2391.04
what effie data was on best try thinking

2389.119 --> 2393.119
for hours still didn't know what a

2391.04 --> 2394.96
straight line is

2393.119 --> 2398.7200000000003
really

2394.96 --> 2398.7200000000003
but he must have been trolling

2409.2 --> 2413.359
are you sure that he did wasn't just

2411.44 --> 2415.68
kind of

2413.359 --> 2418.64
acting like an anti-flat earther like i

2415.68 --> 2423.24
would act like baldwin

2418.64 --> 2423.24
are you sure he wasn't just doing that

2436.56 --> 2441.359
bendy triangles

2439.359 --> 2443.5989999999997
right yeah it's cool bendy triangles you

2441.359 --> 2445.2799999999997
can't really use it for navigation

2443.599 --> 2448.28
though

2445.28 --> 2448.28
right

2451.15 --> 2454.28
[Music]

2458.4 --> 2464.04
any thoughts on comments a globe

2460.24 --> 2464.04
navigation challenge

2471.68 --> 2475.359
that

2473.04 --> 2479.0
that's that's just cute you know who's

2475.359 --> 2479.0
gonna pay for that

2490.72 --> 2495.4399999999996
also from what i recollect this

2493.359 --> 2499.359
challenge basically is about

2495.44 --> 2499.359
presupposing the ball earth anyway

2500.079 --> 2504.319
like

2501.04 --> 2507.839
i think that the challenge maybe he

2504.319 --> 2511.04
updated the challenge or

2507.839 --> 2514.24
the last time i heard of it

2511.04 --> 2515.52
basically he would make you do something

2514.24 --> 2517.52
that's just part of another

2515.52 --> 2521.44
presupposition and it wouldn't prove the

2517.52 --> 2523.839
earth to be a ball in the first place

2521.44 --> 2523.839
so

2548.4 --> 2554.079
all right it's not like mctoon's

2551.359 --> 2554.96
arguments are exactly up to date it's

2554.079 --> 2556.92
still

2554.96 --> 2561.64
basically

2556.92 --> 2561.64
2015-16 level [ __ ]

2573.599 --> 2576.599
hmm

2586.079 --> 2590.04
flat earth geometry

2598.8 --> 2603.92
that's ridiculous

2601.04 --> 2607.48
to calculate position

2603.92 --> 2607.48
based on flattered

2611.53 --> 2614.6690000000003
[Music]

2615.52 --> 2619.16
i don't get it

2626.64 --> 2633.359
yeah slow mo moon buggy i know

2630.48 --> 2636.96
yeah that was extra annoying

2633.359 --> 2639.68
when he compared it like mandela

2636.96 --> 2642.16
like no no flat earth

2639.68 --> 2646.0
you could actually measure it you can

2642.16 --> 2648.7999999999997
actually do that right mandela

2646.0 --> 2651.359
just is just a presuppositional concept

2648.8 --> 2653.3590000000004
like space-time bending you can't ever

2651.359 --> 2656.16
prove it

2653.359 --> 2658.0789999999997
because how can you prove

2656.16 --> 2660.7999999999997
that reality

2658.079 --> 2663.04
the entire rendering of reality might be

2660.8 --> 2665.76
altered except for some people's

2663.04 --> 2668.88
consciousness you can't prove that you

2665.76 --> 2671.2000000000003
could never prove that

2668.88 --> 2674.079
it's like trying to measure

2671.2 --> 2677.2
a quantity of dark matter

2674.079 --> 2680.319
right like that's per definition within

2677.2 --> 2683.52
the presupposition impossible so it's

2680.319 --> 2688.319
completely conceptual and pointless

2683.52 --> 2690.24
unlike flat earth which is very tangible

2688.319 --> 2693.24
in all kinds of way

2690.24 --> 2693.24
ways

2706.4 --> 2712.4
right yeah it gets dismissed i know

2710.079 --> 2714.96
right so what mctoon's doing is

2712.4 --> 2716.8
basically very similar to what shawn

2714.96 --> 2718.64
hawkins does

2716.8 --> 2721.04
and just whine about the polaris

2718.64 --> 2723.52
challenge all the time and then when you

2721.04 --> 2726.079
give him the data he just says no you're

2723.52 --> 2729.119
wrong and then he's calling you a coward

2726.079 --> 2731.52
and we'll say it start over again right

2729.119 --> 2733.92
oh my tunes

2731.52 --> 2738.24
challenge i guess is kind of similar

2733.92 --> 2740.4
just a little bit more refined seemingly

2738.24 --> 2743.1189999999997
on the surface

2740.4 --> 2746.56
but yeah there is no way

2743.119 --> 2749.119
a glober's ever gonna roll out a

2746.56 --> 2752.0
sizeable amount of cash for

2749.119 --> 2755.599
for a challenge for a flat earther ever

2752.0 --> 2758.0
like it simply never will happen

2755.599 --> 2761.04
right why would they

2758.0 --> 2763.52
do that that means that they would feel

2761.04 --> 2766.56
obligated to admit

2763.52 --> 2769.04
when we're right and they're wrong

2766.56 --> 2772.4
but that's their whole shtick to never

2769.04 --> 2775.44
do that no matter the circumstances even

2772.4 --> 2777.839
if you can't get caught lying within a

2775.44 --> 2780.319
time span of time seconds contradicting

2777.839 --> 2783.52
yourselves and then not then denying it

2780.319 --> 2787.44
right if you'll go there then what's

2783.52 --> 2789.599
what why would they ever admit

2787.44 --> 2791.68
to a challenge that

2789.599 --> 2793.6800000000003
the one taking it has succeeded and then

2791.68 --> 2795.9199999999996
pay out the money like why would they

2793.68 --> 2798.7999999999997
ever do that

2795.92 --> 2801.119
if you've already gone to the level

2798.8 --> 2803.44
of double speaking in the same sentence

2801.119 --> 2805.6800000000003
and then denying it

2803.44 --> 2805.68
right

2808.56 --> 2814.64
why would you ever think

2811.28 --> 2817.3590000000004
that he would actually fulfill

2814.64 --> 2821.24
such a promise there's just no way

2817.359 --> 2821.24
why would he do that

2832.96 --> 2836.439
uh

2833.28 --> 2836.4390000000003
[Music]

2839.359 --> 2843.96
oh bobby bobby bobby

2844.72 --> 2849.2
maybe you should just

2846.72 --> 2853.24
stand in the corner smiling and don't

2849.2 --> 2853.24
try to add to the conversation

2879.119 --> 2884.48
stop blabbering your [ __ ] bobby

2881.44 --> 2887.839
steals or i am going to time you out and

2884.48 --> 2887.839
then ban you

2892.72 --> 2899.1189999999997
yep it's a known fact bobby steals that

2895.92 --> 2899.119
anti-flat earthers

2899.2 --> 2903.2799999999997
yeah

2901.839 --> 2908.0789999999997
they lie

2903.28 --> 2908.079
to your face provably it's on record

2908.48 --> 2912.319
say one thing then they say the exact

2911.04 --> 2914.72
opposite

2912.319 --> 2918.48
then they deny

2914.72 --> 2920.3999999999996
having ever set the first part

2918.48 --> 2921.839
and then maybe even another time with

2920.4 --> 2923.6800000000003
the second part when they change their

2921.839 --> 2926.0
position again

2923.68 --> 2927.68
so that's happened on multiple occasions

2926.0 --> 2931.2
it's provable

2927.68 --> 2933.5989999999997
why would anybody ever

2931.2 --> 2936.3999999999996
think that a person that does that in

2933.599 --> 2939.04
just a regular conversation why would

2936.4 --> 2941.599
you ever think that they would pay out

2939.04 --> 2943.04
significant amounts of money in a

2941.599 --> 2944.88
challenge

2943.04 --> 2947.92
it's just no way

2944.88 --> 2951.359
like no person

2947.92 --> 2955.2400000000002
would naturally believe that would be

2951.359 --> 2955.24
the thing that could happen

2959.68 --> 2963.1189999999997
right

2961.04 --> 2965.92
if you turn into a double speaking

2963.119 --> 2967.92
stuttering idiot that's just a straight

2965.92 --> 2970.8
out liar about what they said even

2967.92 --> 2972.8
within a time span of a minute

2970.8 --> 2975.92
then why would you believe they would

2972.8 --> 2976.8
uphold any type of obligation if they

2975.92 --> 2979.76
could

2976.8 --> 2982.079
get away with just not doing it

2979.76 --> 2982.079
why

2982.319 --> 2986.4
right

2984.0 --> 2988.559
it's like hey this is a known scam

2986.4 --> 2991.44
artist he like did active pyramid

2988.559 --> 2993.2000000000003
schemes he even went to jail for it

2991.44 --> 2994.319
and he's at it again

2993.2 --> 2998.319
dude

2994.319 --> 2999.359
let's trust him

2998.319 --> 3002.16
no

2999.359 --> 3004.48
that's not a good thing

3002.16 --> 3007.52
you know what's gonna happen

3004.48 --> 3010.92
it's almost like you're tempting them to

3007.52 --> 3010.92
do it again

3023.359 --> 3026.7999999999997
yeah ice

3024.839 --> 3029.04
cube that's

3026.8 --> 3030.96
very nice but

3029.04 --> 3033.92
i'm pretty certain that everybody that

3030.96 --> 3035.76
has indulged in the challenge have

3033.92 --> 3039.16
already won

3035.76 --> 3039.1600000000003
it was denied

3040.4 --> 3043.6800000000003
i think it's already happened

3050.16 --> 3054.7999999999997
so yeah designed to only be one yeah

3052.319 --> 3056.48
yeah it's like yes here's the challenge

3054.8 --> 3059.119
it's very doable

3056.48 --> 3061.52
but don't expect to actually be given

3059.119 --> 3064.76
the win even if everybody can see that

3061.52 --> 3064.7599999999998
you won

3089.28 --> 3092.92
right psych there

3100.16 --> 3103.16
so

3115.41 --> 3118.5499999999997
[Music]

3161.44 --> 3166.4
yeah yeah but the thing is you know a

3163.92 --> 3168.64
bunch of squirters out there

3166.4 --> 3171.119
bobby steals the kumu virus that we're

3168.64 --> 3173.7599999999998
not going to do it

3171.119 --> 3176.7200000000003
because if we start trying that [ __ ]

3173.76 --> 3179.3590000000004
again you're literally going to rub us

3176.72 --> 3181.4399999999996
off our energy trying to fulfill your

3179.359 --> 3183.52
stupid little schemes

3181.44 --> 3186.4
everybody gets rejected

3183.52 --> 3189.839
we all feel stupid and we should because

3186.4 --> 3192.2400000000002
we engaged expecting actually to be able

3189.839 --> 3194.64
to be given a win

3192.24 --> 3196.72
when of course we're not going to get be

3194.64 --> 3200.24
given a win and then all of you are just

3196.72 --> 3202.9599999999996
going to be whining again like ha ha ha

3200.24 --> 3205.2
look at them they can't win yeah because

3202.96 --> 3207.2
you're not giving it

3205.2 --> 3211.2
even though we are winning

3207.2 --> 3213.7599999999998
so go [ __ ] yourselves seriously

3211.2 --> 3216.7999999999997
shove your challenges up your ass we

3213.76 --> 3219.3590000000004
know it's flat we prove it's flat

3216.8 --> 3222.48
when we get you over the floor

3219.359 --> 3225.2799999999997
you prove it's flat

3222.48 --> 3227.52
why the hell would we go up against your

3225.28 --> 3229.52
stupid little challenges that are just

3227.52 --> 3231.28
rigged

3229.52 --> 3234.96
so that you can't

3231.28 --> 3238.6400000000003
actually be given a win

3234.96 --> 3238.64
in the end they're not doing it

3243.28 --> 3248.119
that's the point

3244.8 --> 3248.119
that's ridiculous

3276.72 --> 3281.2799999999997
the most obnoxious

3279.2 --> 3284.24
oh

3281.28 --> 3286.079
it's definitely a hard struggle but nah

3284.24 --> 3287.68
i think that fight the flat earth is

3286.079 --> 3290.6400000000003
probably the most

3287.68 --> 3290.64
obnoxious one

3291.44 --> 3296.0
although simon dan is definitely close

3293.44 --> 3299.0
second i don't think mctoon is even that

3296.0 --> 3299.0
irritating

3324.96 --> 3332.48
without using a globe the ice cube

3328.559 --> 3334.4
nobody uses a globe

3332.48 --> 3338.72
when navigating

3334.4 --> 3341.52
navigator manuals don't have globes

3338.72 --> 3343.52
actually utilized yeah they might show a

3341.52 --> 3345.28
globe

3343.52 --> 3348.599
right

3345.28 --> 3348.599
in a diagram

3348.72 --> 3353.2799999999997
and then yeah if you realize what you're

3350.88 --> 3355.76
looking at that that would be a claim

3353.28 --> 3356.88
that when you use it you're inside of

3355.76 --> 3361.2000000000003
the globe

3356.88 --> 3361.2000000000003
well you're not inside of the globe

3361.44 --> 3368.88
it's just a prop

3364.16 --> 3370.72
you don't actually use the globe

3368.88 --> 3373.44
for like the surface you're standing

3370.72 --> 3376.16
you're using a flat plane right

3373.44 --> 3379.839
the only thing spherical involved in any

3376.16 --> 3382.0789999999997
sort of way are the celestial sphere

3379.839 --> 3384.88
the apparent celestial sphere which is

3382.079 --> 3387.599
kind of then engineered into a parallel

3384.88 --> 3387.599
flat map

3389.68 --> 3393.839
by using all the zenith points

3392.799 --> 3395.839
right

3393.839 --> 3397.2
and then mapping them out in a in a

3395.839 --> 3399.839
parallel

3397.2 --> 3401.2
flat map that's how you actually do

3399.839 --> 3403.52
navigate

3401.2 --> 3406.3999999999996
there is no globe involved nothing

3403.52 --> 3406.4
whatsoever

3406.48 --> 3411.2
who've used the glo yeah what to shove

3408.64 --> 3413.7599999999998
it up your ass akuma virus

3411.2 --> 3415.359
there is no globe involved right you can

3413.76 --> 3418.4
shove a globe up your ass that doesn't

3415.359 --> 3421.359
make it involved in navigation it isn't

3418.4 --> 3424.319
you don't use globe maps you don't use a

3421.359 --> 3425.2799999999997
globe in navigation at all

3424.319 --> 3426.48
right

3425.28 --> 3429.52
that's why

3426.48 --> 3431.52
during the exploration phase

3429.52 --> 3436.079
a ship's captain

3431.52 --> 3438.88
didn't have a [ __ ] globe map

3436.079 --> 3443.119
you [ __ ] wit they didn't

3438.88 --> 3445.44
use a globe map they always use flat

3443.119 --> 3448.88
maps and they might

3445.44 --> 3450.559
have had a globe of the celestial

3448.88 --> 3453.359
constellations

3450.559 --> 3455.52
and that's it that's the only spherical

3453.359 --> 3457.359
object that's even involved in that

3455.52 --> 3461.119
period of time

3457.359 --> 3464.96
there was no globe map there is no globe

3461.119 --> 3466.079
map that was ever used in navigation

3464.96 --> 3467.2
never

3466.079 --> 3472.599
ever

3467.2 --> 3472.5989999999997
even on to modern times never ever

3489.599 --> 3494.88
oh my god

3492.4 --> 3497.44
gps is

3494.88 --> 3499.119
is a euclidean grid

3497.44 --> 3502.4
bobby steals

3499.119 --> 3503.839
it's not a globe map

3502.4 --> 3507.2000000000003
right

3503.839 --> 3511.04
now any visuals you might get

3507.2 --> 3513.839
when using gps might be represented as a

3511.04 --> 3515.599
globe as you zoom out

3513.839 --> 3522.0
but the actual

3515.599 --> 3524.7200000000003
coordination data that is used in gps

3522.0 --> 3526.16
is all euclidean

3524.72 --> 3528.9599999999996
parallel

3526.16 --> 3533.1189999999997
flat plane data

3528.96 --> 3533.119
yeah it's absolute

3534.0 --> 3542.799
it's absolutely flat and euclidean right

3537.839 --> 3546.96
because every gps coordinate data point

3542.799 --> 3548.88
is all in the same x like

3546.96 --> 3551.2
you could literally put the different

3548.88 --> 3552.4
data together and then it all fits in a

3551.2 --> 3554.5589999999997
giant

3552.4 --> 3557.599
euclidean

3554.559 --> 3559.8390000000004
block of data coordination coordinates

3557.599 --> 3559.839
data

3560.079 --> 3566.599
euclidean on a flat surface right every

3563.119 --> 3566.599
part is flat

3591.68 --> 3594.68
uh

3606.0 --> 3611.44
no no that it's not the globe map

3609.2 --> 3614.7599999999998
that look that's not what i was talking

3611.44 --> 3614.76
about earlier

3615.119 --> 3619.52
logical conclusion

3617.2 --> 3622.5589999999997
very illogical conclusion yeah i'm not

3619.52 --> 3625.68
talking about the map on which you

3622.559 --> 3626.559
finally pinpoint where you are

3625.68 --> 3629.2799999999997
right

3626.559 --> 3633.119
i'm talking about the actual navigation

3629.28 --> 3635.8390000000004
process before that point before you

3633.119 --> 3639.839
pinpoint on a map where you are by

3635.839 --> 3639.839
relaying the data yeah

3640.24 --> 3645.4399999999996
you measure the angles between the

3642.16 --> 3649.5989999999997
celestials and then cross reference it

3645.44 --> 3652.88
the celestial map and the time

3649.599 --> 3655.92
and then you can combine the data with

3652.88 --> 3658.0
the eventual map projection to pinpoint

3655.92 --> 3659.119
your location roughly that's how it

3658.0 --> 3662.24
works

3659.119 --> 3665.119
right there is no globe

3662.24 --> 3668.24
involved in that actual navigation

3665.119 --> 3669.52
process right now yeah you can use any

3668.24 --> 3672.9599999999996
kind of map

3669.52 --> 3674.64
after that to relay the location

3672.96 --> 3676.96
any kind of map

3674.64 --> 3678.64
right you can use a freaking

3676.96 --> 3680.96
triangle map

3678.64 --> 3683.68
you could still use a triangle map to

3680.96 --> 3685.04
eventually pinpoint your location on

3683.68 --> 3687.2
right

3685.04 --> 3690.4
glow projection any kind of projection

3687.2 --> 3691.1189999999997
because it's just about pinpointing on

3690.4 --> 3693.28
it

3691.119 --> 3695.04
where you are based on like latitude

3693.28 --> 3698.0400000000004
longitude

3695.04 --> 3698.04
relations

3702.799 --> 3708.96
but the actual navigation process itself

3706.4 --> 3711.44
does not involve a globe it only

3708.96 --> 3713.68
involves flat planes and

3711.44 --> 3717.76
angles

3713.68 --> 3717.7599999999998
angled between them between

3717.92 --> 3722.48
flat plane of the stars which is a kind

3720.559 --> 3725.039
of a map projection on its own because

3722.48 --> 3727.52
it's actually spherical and apparent

3725.039 --> 3729.3590000000004
non-actual positioned

3727.52 --> 3731.44
angular position

3729.359 --> 3733.359
then projected into a parallel flat

3731.44 --> 3734.799
plane parallel to the flat plane we're

3733.359 --> 3736.88
standing on

3734.799 --> 3738.799
that's what's used in the navigation

3736.88 --> 3740.6400000000003
process and then after

3738.799 --> 3742.799
you got it all right

3740.64 --> 3744.64
that's where you can then

3742.799 --> 3748.4
use the data coming from that to

3744.64 --> 3752.48
pinpoint on any type of map

3748.4 --> 3754.799
of the surface where you are

3752.48 --> 3757.28
it doesn't matter whether that map is

3754.799 --> 3759.0389999999998
supposedly a globe projection or is

3757.28 --> 3761.3590000000004
another type of projection it doesn't

3759.039 --> 3761.3590000000004
matter

3761.599 --> 3767.1600000000003
it's just pinpointing where you are on

3764.079 --> 3767.1600000000003
the map

3768.4 --> 3773.6800000000003
you can't do it without oh akumu virus

3771.68 --> 3776.799
why don't you get on the flat earth

3773.68 --> 3779.0389999999998
debate and demonstrate that for us

3776.799 --> 3782.0389999999998
you're stuttering double speaking funny

3779.039 --> 3782.039
[ __ ]

3782.88 --> 3788.48
we're not buying your stupid-ass bluffs

3786.16 --> 3788.48
yeah

3788.559 --> 3793.76
i mean it might work

3791.359 --> 3795.44
on those crack junkies you used to deal

3793.76 --> 3798.559
with right

3795.44 --> 3802.0
doesn't work on us we're not buying your

3798.559 --> 3803.039
cheap ass bluffs that obviously aren't

3802.0 --> 3805.2
true

3803.039 --> 3808.88
you dumbass

3805.2 --> 3812.0789999999997
you can't do it without a plane

3808.88 --> 3814.7200000000003
nobody can that's an integral part of

3812.079 --> 3816.96
the navigation process

3814.72 --> 3818.48
so if you really say that you can't do

3816.96 --> 3819.839
it why don't you get on the flat earth

3818.48 --> 3821.2
debate

3819.839 --> 3823.68
discord

3821.2 --> 3826.72
and then demonstrate how you're doing

3823.68 --> 3826.72
that ass

3826.799 --> 3832.16
yeah do it then do it then akumu

3830.16 --> 3834.5589999999997
do it then

3832.16 --> 3838.0299999999997

3834.559 --> 3841.159
you're a liar you can't do that

you understand math no you don't you're

a delusional idiot

3891.119 --> 3896.2400000000002
yeah you can't even

3893.2 --> 3899.0389999999998
provide any kind of proof that you can

3896.24 --> 3902.3999999999996
do navigation with a globe right i know

3899.039 --> 3903.2000000000003
you tried that before and failed utterly

3902.4 --> 3905.28
yeah

3903.2 --> 3907.52
now you're saying you can do it without

3905.28 --> 3909.76
a plane oh really with what with the

3907.52 --> 3912.319
globe that you were absolutely

3909.76 --> 3914.6400000000003
unsuccessful with doing that

3912.319 --> 3917.2
so what are you going to do it with then

3914.64 --> 3920.2
if you don't need a flat plane you lying

3957.68 --> 3960.48
assuming it's like

what

3967.039 --> 3973.039
assuming

3968.88 --> 3978.6800000000003
what what does that have to do with it

3973.039 --> 3978.6800000000003
what does assumption have to do with it

3983.2 --> 3986.2
it's

4031.44 --> 4034.44
yes

4040.0 --> 4042.559
thank god

4042.96 --> 4046.68
i need a good laugh

4059.92 --> 4065.359
bobby stegall

4061.359 --> 4065.359
are you do you realize

4066.079 --> 4070.88
how much of a projection you're just

4068.16 --> 4072.5589999999997
this do you even realize how much you

4070.88 --> 4076.1600000000003
are

4072.559 --> 4078.96
engaged in like serious double thing

4076.16 --> 4078.96
when you say that

4079.039 --> 4085.8390000000004
i mean that sentence which perfectly

4082.24 --> 4088.72
addresses akuma virus perfectly

4085.839 --> 4092.92
you but you meant that for us didn't you

come on

4168.439 --> 4175.839
[Music]

4170.64 --> 4175.839
yeah tara 306 he keeps saying that right

4185.12 --> 4189.599999999999
but yeah i don't think a mathematician

4187.279 --> 4192.2390000000005
would say something like

4189.6 --> 4195.04
yeah man i don't need a flat plane for

4192.239 --> 4195.04
navigation

4195.44 --> 4200.4
like

4197.199 --> 4202.719
a regular mathematician would simply not

4200.4 --> 4206.0
say that if they were uninformed they

4202.719 --> 4207.52
would be wise enough to say like maybe i

4206.0 --> 4209.12
should check out what this actually

4207.52 --> 4212.8
entails

4209.12 --> 4212.8
and then see if it is the case

4213.04 --> 4217.6
and then they would conclude like no

4214.96 --> 4219.199
wait they it does use flat planes they

4217.6 --> 4221.280000000001
still believe there was a globe they

4219.199 --> 4224.239
would probably be like that's kind of

4221.28 --> 4226.48
odd weird

4224.239 --> 4229.12
right but they wouldn't just say like oh

4226.48 --> 4233.199
i can do it without the flat plane when

4229.12 --> 4235.04
like that's exactly what is used

4233.199 --> 4236.32
two flat planes the one you're standing

4235.04 --> 4237.679
on

4236.32 --> 4239.92
right

4237.679 --> 4241.2390000000005
and then the

4239.92 --> 4244.64
convention

4241.239 --> 4245.919999999999
coordination system based flat plane of

4244.64 --> 4248.96
the stars

4245.92 --> 4251.12
parallel to that flat plane

4248.96 --> 4253.12
and that's how you use

4251.12 --> 4254.64
like the whole triangle process that's

4253.12 --> 4255.5199999999995
what it is

4254.64 --> 4257.52
right

4255.52 --> 4259.84
a mathematician would never say

4257.52 --> 4263.280000000001
something as ridiculous as

4259.84 --> 4265.360000000001
i don't need a flat plane for navigation

4263.28 --> 4269.36
is this just mechanically wrong why

4265.36 --> 4269.36
would the mathematician say that

4270.64 --> 4274.88
i mean if you were like a

4273.28 --> 4277.28
astrophysicist

4274.88 --> 4279.04
theorist or something

4277.28 --> 4281.84
then maybe

4279.04 --> 4284.32
you'd say but oh there are ways to

4281.84 --> 4286.64
actually do it blah blah blah you just

4284.32 --> 4287.84
change the pseudo-ramone force space or

4286.64 --> 4290.0
some other

4287.84 --> 4291.92
conceptual medium right

4290.0 --> 4294.159
and then i get like the trainer thinking

4291.92 --> 4297.92
but to just say

4294.159 --> 4301.12
i can do navigation without a flat plane

4297.92 --> 4304.0
that's not a mathematician that's a

4301.12 --> 4306.4
lying [ __ ]

4304.0 --> 4309.6
that thinks that they can convince

4306.4 --> 4311.28
people that they're a mathematician

4309.6 --> 4313.84
when you don't even have to be a

4311.28 --> 4316.84
mathematician to realize that's total

is what they can be expecting today

4383.13 --> 4386.27
[Music]

4408.719 --> 4412.64
that's hilarious man on the edge the

4410.32 --> 4415.84
thing though is that

4412.64 --> 4418.400000000001
technically it doesn't like

4415.84 --> 4421.1990000000005
you can't really debunk something that

4418.4 --> 4423.04
hasn't been properly defined

4421.199 --> 4425.199
right

4423.04 --> 4427.679
you can't actually debunk gravity

4425.199 --> 4430.4
because there is no

4427.679 --> 4433.12
real claim actually made it's just

4430.4 --> 4435.44
conceptual when people associate that

4433.12 --> 4437.599999999999
with gravity

4435.44 --> 4440.879999999999
and in that sense nothing you can't

4437.6 --> 4443.04
really do anything to debunk gravity but

4440.88 --> 4445.76
you could point at

4443.04 --> 4449.36
certain gravity models that are often

4445.76 --> 4450.320000000001
drawn into maths and assumptions

4449.36 --> 4453.28
like

4450.32 --> 4455.84
the newtonian model which

4453.28 --> 4458.8
completely excludes

4455.84 --> 4460.64
gas behavior within its function

4458.8 --> 4463.84
and basically

4460.64 --> 4465.12
neutralizes that pesky ability

4463.84 --> 4466.08
of gas

4465.12 --> 4470.5599999999995
by

4466.08 --> 4474.239
declaring it a fluid and attributing

4470.56 --> 4475.52
vectorial weight to it

4474.239 --> 4477.5199999999995
right

4475.52 --> 4480.320000000001
you can't actually debunk something that

4477.52 --> 4481.679
hasn't been defined

4480.32 --> 4483.679
that's the thing

4481.679 --> 4487.04
you could debunk

4483.679 --> 4489.84
a claim of an application in a real

4487.04 --> 4492.4
world case of it you could say like no

4489.84 --> 4495.360000000001
that's not actually what it is

4492.4 --> 4498.0
you don't have any proof

4495.36 --> 4500.4
but just the concept like a concept

4498.0 --> 4504.48
can't technically be debunked if there

4500.4 --> 4508.08
is no claim about it

4504.48 --> 4508.08
anyway i'm just being nitpicky here

4508.159 --> 4512.239
all right gas doesn't go down go boom

4509.52 --> 4515.1990000000005
boom and cigarette smoke

4512.239 --> 4516.959999999999
is kind of weird because

4515.199 --> 4519.04
like it is even

4516.96 --> 4522.0
it's weirder right cigarette smoke going

4519.04 --> 4525.12
up is weird because

4522.0 --> 4527.92
they're solids smoke is actually solid

4525.12 --> 4529.12
and white goes up because

4527.92 --> 4532.32
the heat

4529.12 --> 4534.08
that is sticking to it

4532.32 --> 4537.04
it's being carried

4534.08 --> 4539.6
upward by hot gas

4537.04 --> 4541.199
and when it cools down it kind of like

4539.6 --> 4543.4400000000005
dissipates and

4541.199 --> 4545.36
dwindles down again

4543.44 --> 4548.0
because it's no longer accompanied by

4545.36 --> 4550.32
hot gas which is a lower density than a

4548.0 --> 4553.48
regular air which makes it go up because

4550.32 --> 4553.48
of the disequilibrium

4561.92 --> 4567.1990000000005
but yeah again i was just being nitpicky

4564.32 --> 4570.679
and using your remark as an excuse to

4567.199 --> 4570.678999999999
explain this

4581.92 --> 4586.88
what

4583.679 --> 4586.88
logical conclusion

4588.64 --> 4591.360000000001
the bubble

4592.4 --> 4595.839999999999
what are you saying that

4596.159 --> 4601.04
you gotta back that up with something

4598.48 --> 4604.239
logical conclusion

4601.04 --> 4605.5199999999995
the bubble was first invented so that

4604.239 --> 4607.599999999999
means

4605.52 --> 4611.1990000000005
also

4607.6 --> 4611.1990000000005
like industrial glass

4616.32 --> 4621.12
it might be true

4618.08 --> 4624.08
i don't know when glass even was really

4621.12 --> 4626.8
figured out was probably during the age

4624.08 --> 4626.8
of alchemy

4627.28 --> 4630.5599999999995
right

4628.8 --> 4632.8
i don't know when was glass even

4630.56 --> 4635.52
officially figured out because that is

4632.8 --> 4638.96
absolutely without a doubt what you need

4635.52 --> 4641.679
in order to have a device

4638.96 --> 4641.679
like a bubble

4641.84 --> 4646.64
right while a sextant

4643.84 --> 4648.32
technically and this is think about it

4646.64 --> 4649.679
technically a sextant could have been

4648.32 --> 4654.08
figured out

4649.679 --> 4656.08
in the most ancient of ancient times

4654.08 --> 4657.6
because technically

4656.08 --> 4659.84
you could just

4657.6 --> 4663.280000000001
cut

4659.84 --> 4665.52
a sextant out of a piece of wood

4663.28 --> 4668.0
and you wouldn't even need

4665.52 --> 4670.320000000001
metals for that

4668.0 --> 4672.56
literally

4670.32 --> 4673.84
it wouldn't be as accurate right but

4672.56 --> 4676.4800000000005
technically

4673.84 --> 4679.92
it's like the whole

4676.48 --> 4683.199
viking sword pommel right

4679.92 --> 4684.93
they had like celestial navigation tools

4683.199 --> 4686.719
like built in their swords

4684.93 --> 4687.84
[Music]

4686.719 --> 4690.96
it's like a

4687.84 --> 4693.360000000001
previous version of

4690.96 --> 4697.12
of like a sexton

4693.36 --> 4699.599999999999
right so it can be extremely ancient a

4697.12 --> 4703.599999999999
bubble however

4699.6 --> 4706.56
very specifically requires glass

4703.6 --> 4709.280000000001
fine crafted glass

4706.56 --> 4713.120000000001
how the hell are you going to enclose

4709.28 --> 4716.5599999999995
liquid and a piece of air in closed off

4713.12 --> 4716.5599999999995
gas glass that dude

4717.44 --> 4724.96
that's not an easy thing

4721.36 --> 4724.96
so could you back that up

4725.52 --> 4729.88
bubble level

4726.88 --> 4729.88
1661

4732.32 --> 4735.32
really

4736.4 --> 4739.44
i gotta look that up

4740.8 --> 4747.8
it's weirding me out by the way a bubble

4743.36 --> 4747.799999999999
is completely useless

4748.8 --> 4753.04
uh

4750.0 --> 4753.04
on ocean

4754.4 --> 4758.08
because how are you the hell are you

4756.159 --> 4759.599999999999
going to keep it level

4758.08 --> 4762.88
like how are you going to keep that

4759.6 --> 4766.320000000001
bubble level on a rocking boat

4762.88 --> 4770.08
really how would you do that

4766.32 --> 4770.08
it's extremely impractical

4770.96 --> 4774.96
in reality

4772.32 --> 4777.679
the only thing you ever need was just a

4774.96 --> 4780.4800000000005
basic sextant there was no standardized

4777.679 --> 4782.64
bubbles in those freaking things

4780.48 --> 4784.718999999999
and without the bubbles they were used

4782.64 --> 4788.08
on the ocean

4784.719 --> 4789.6
by pretty much every ship fairer

4788.08 --> 4792.8
in that period

4789.6 --> 4794.159000000001
and there were no bubbles

4792.8 --> 4798.159000000001
yeah

4794.159 --> 4801.04
i mean even like every single historical

4798.159 --> 4803.759999999999
movie from that period show you

4801.04 --> 4808.12
sexton's without bubbles

4803.76 --> 4808.12
they didn't have them

4818.4 --> 4822.48
this

4820.0 --> 4822.48
where is it

4827.04 --> 4832.08
trying to look for the history within

4829.28 --> 4833.759999999999
the wikipedia

4832.08 --> 4835.679
can't really find

4833.76 --> 4838.679
when

4835.679 --> 4838.679
like

4856.639 --> 4859.639
hmm

4860.639 --> 4865.159000000001
all right i think i found something here

4880.96 --> 4883.44
hmm

4882.159 --> 4885.44
right it is

4883.44 --> 4890.239
according to wiki

4885.44 --> 4893.36
the bubble was indeed invented in 1661

4890.239 --> 4893.36
and also mentions

4893.76 --> 4896.639
right next to that

4895.679 --> 4900.159
that it

4896.639 --> 4904.76
did not come into widespread use until

4900.159 --> 4904.759999999999
the beginning of the 18th century

4917.36 --> 4922.759999999999
right so it was

4919.12 --> 4922.76
a niche tool

4932.239 --> 4938.0
right but anyway look that's just

4935.6 --> 4940.56
comparing the regular sextant like the

4938.0 --> 4942.96
western sextant invention right i

4940.56 --> 4946.159000000001
already explained that

4942.96 --> 4948.96
other forms of celestial navigation were

4946.159 --> 4951.36
used by

4948.96 --> 4953.28
peoples

4951.36 --> 4955.5199999999995
that have been using them potentially

4953.28 --> 4957.36
for thousands of years

4955.52 --> 4960.719
like way

4957.36 --> 4960.719
way before

4960.96 --> 4964.4800000000005
like medieval times

4969.44 --> 4972.239
right

4970.4 --> 4975.04
that's not gonna be the case with the

4972.239 --> 4975.04
freaking bubble

4975.28 --> 4980.8
again because how the hell do you create

4978.48 --> 4982.0
good transparent glass that's stable

4980.8 --> 4983.28
doesn't break

4982.0 --> 4986.4
and then

4983.28 --> 4988.5599999999995
have it closed off with liquid and

4986.4 --> 4990.638999999999
a piece of air in there and then have it

4988.56 --> 4992.400000000001
stayed closed that it doesn't leak and

4990.639 --> 4994.159000000001
just dry up after

4992.4 --> 4996.719999999999
a week right

4994.159 --> 4999.199
how the hell would they make that

4996.72 --> 5003.6
[Music]

4999.199 --> 5005.839999999999
that sounds like an extremely tedious

5003.6 --> 5008.639
thing to accomplish like even in the

5005.84 --> 5011.76
17th century so

5008.639 --> 5014.400000000001
yeah while the basic navigation tools

5011.76 --> 5017.12
like the vikings used it's

5014.4 --> 5019.599999999999
it could technically just be a piece of

5017.12 --> 5022.159
wood with a couple of holes in it

5019.6 --> 5022.159000000001
that's it

5022.32 --> 5025.5199999999995
that would be sufficient

5027.04 --> 5032.48
you didn't need a bubble for that

5029.92 --> 5034.56
right they never need a bubble for that

5032.48 --> 5036.718999999999
like if you're gonna look

5034.56 --> 5039.950000000001
maybe i should like bubble sexton and

5036.719 --> 5043.01
just look up that

5039.95 --> 5043.01
[Music]

5046.88 --> 5051.0
call it an octant what

5065.92 --> 5070.6
oh wow there's very little

5076.32 --> 5079.5199999999995
ah bert

5078.32 --> 5083.04
wow

5079.52 --> 5084.400000000001
admiral byrd developed a bubble section

5083.04 --> 5085.679
right

5084.4 --> 5089.839999999999
so yeah

5085.679 --> 5092.96
that means 20th century that means

5089.84 --> 5095.92
no bubble sextance

5092.96 --> 5096.8
during the entire exploration age

5095.92 --> 5098.88
yeah

5096.8 --> 5100.400000000001
it's in wikipedia

5098.88 --> 5104.0
it's right there

5100.4 --> 5107.5199999999995
let me share that with you guys

5104.0 --> 5109.84
so you can see for yourself

5107.52 --> 5111.84
right that's what i always thought

5109.84 --> 5114.8
they call it the bubble octant for some

5111.84 --> 5114.8
reason i don't know why

5118.48 --> 5122.799999999999
according to them they're air navigation

5120.639 --> 5123.92
instruments that's interesting

5122.8 --> 5127.84
because in the air you wouldn't

5123.92 --> 5127.84
typically that makes sense

5131.36 --> 5135.199
because you're not like rocking on water

5133.44 --> 5137.599999999999
in the air so it's

5135.199 --> 5140.08
if you just fly it's much easier to kind

5137.6 --> 5142.96
of keep it steady in a way yeah you

5140.08 --> 5145.12
might ramble a bit but that's

5142.96 --> 5147.76
you're not gonna be changing your angle

5145.12 --> 5149.28
constantly so that makes it indeed a

5147.76 --> 5151.12
bubble much more

5149.28 --> 5153.44
useful

5151.12 --> 5155.679
on an airplane it's interesting i'm

5153.44 --> 5157.199
learning something there

5155.679 --> 5159.4400000000005
right but yeah

5157.199 --> 5162.32
according to this wiki it was invented

5159.44 --> 5163.199
by admiral bird

5162.32 --> 5164.239
so

5163.199 --> 5168.44
not

5164.239 --> 5168.44
during the renaissance

5169.679 --> 5173.6
yeah

5171.92 --> 5176.159
it doesn't even matter at this point

5173.6 --> 5177.719
that the bubble had been invented

5176.159 --> 5180.4
long ago in

5177.719 --> 5183.28
1661 or whatever

5180.4 --> 5186.4
it wasn't used

5183.28 --> 5189.5599999999995
for navigation until admiral byrd

5186.4 --> 5191.759999999999
invented it what is in the 20th century

5189.56 --> 5194.639
specifically noted

5191.76 --> 5198.320000000001
for aircraft

5194.639 --> 5198.32
isn't that something ah

5202.8 --> 5206.56
the claim was bubble level

5207.52 --> 5211.360000000001
uh no

5209.679 --> 5212.159
no it isn't

5211.36 --> 5214.48
no

5212.159 --> 5217.679
it's constantly claimed that you have to

5214.48 --> 5218.718999999999
use a bubble in a sexton

5217.679 --> 5220.56
right

5218.719 --> 5222.2390000000005
that's what the anti-flat earthers have

5220.56 --> 5224.8
been rolling out that's what they've

5222.239 --> 5226.799999999999
been doing all this time saying no you

5224.8 --> 5228.0
knew you could do it with the bubble you

5226.8 --> 5230.56
could do it

5228.0 --> 5231.84
yeah yeah but they didn't though

5230.56 --> 5233.52
probably

5231.84 --> 5234.88
because a bubble

5233.52 --> 5238.8
sexton

5234.88 --> 5240.2390000000005
is a 20th century invention

5238.8 --> 5243.6
post

5240.239 --> 5243.599999999999
navigation era

5244.0 --> 5248.719
yeah i don't give a [ __ ] if he said

5246.159 --> 5252.239
bubble level akumovirus

5248.719 --> 5254.719
i'm not addressing his in the moment who

5252.239 --> 5257.5199999999995
gives a [ __ ] claim i'm in dress i'm

5254.719 --> 5260.159
addressing everybody i'm addressing the

5257.52 --> 5262.2390000000005
entire scene here

5260.159 --> 5265.04
where these [ __ ] anti-flat earthers

5262.239 --> 5268.32
are saying oh but you can use a bubble

5265.04 --> 5271.44
sextant you don't need the horizon yeah

5268.32 --> 5274.639
but they didn't though because bubble

5271.44 --> 5279.678999999999
sextants were only invented in the 20th

5274.639 --> 5281.2390000000005
century by admiral byrd for aircraft

5279.679 --> 5284.77
not

5281.239 --> 5287.8189999999995
oceanic travel

5284.77 --> 5287.819
[Music]

5294.639 --> 5299.04
right so now that has been officially

5297.36 --> 5301.839999999999
established

5299.04 --> 5303.5199999999995
i'm gonna have that carved into my

5301.84 --> 5304.719
historical

5303.52 --> 5307.6
picture

5304.719 --> 5310.08
now we're gonna forget that again

5307.6 --> 5312.320000000001
so that if any stupid anti-flat earther

5310.08 --> 5315.5199999999995
says oh would we always use bubble

5312.32 --> 5317.5199999999995
sextants it's a lie

5315.52 --> 5319.6
they didn't

5317.52 --> 5322.76
i just weakened it and linked you up

5319.6 --> 5322.76
with that

5323.199 --> 5326.96
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah let's let's red

5325.84 --> 5329.679
herring

5326.96 --> 5331.52
let's move on let's move on let's let's

5329.679 --> 5334.2390000000005
look up coriolis

5331.52 --> 5337.280000000001
effect now yeah yeah yeah no no no no

5334.239 --> 5340.959999999999
i'll just stick to this fact

5337.28 --> 5344.8
so that if you lie about it again in a

5340.96 --> 5348.52
historical context i can correct you

5344.8 --> 5348.52
about that

5354.719 --> 5360.08
thank you psych bear make sure to spread

5357.28 --> 5363.04
the knowledge i mean it this is a it's

5360.08 --> 5363.04
important find

5363.44 --> 5369.5199999999995
right also it's not just

5365.52 --> 5371.52
in the time it was invented for aircraft

5369.52 --> 5373.84
and that makes sense to me right because

5371.52 --> 5375.76
an aircraft is not

5373.84 --> 5377.52
sitting on a rocking ocean that's

5375.76 --> 5379.52
constantly going to make that bubble

5377.52 --> 5381.360000000001
just impossible to use

5379.52 --> 5383.76
in an aircraft

5381.36 --> 5386.4
you will be stable because the air

5383.76 --> 5388.320000000001
doesn't rock you like a boat so it makes

5386.4 --> 5389.5199999999995
perfect sense where when aircraft

5388.32 --> 5392.4
invented

5389.52 --> 5394.2390000000005
20th century it all fits

5392.4 --> 5397.759999999999
now it makes sense

5394.239 --> 5401.36
it was invented for aircraft not

5397.76 --> 5405.52
for oceanic navigation

5401.36 --> 5408.96
so yeah that means they didn't use

5405.52 --> 5410.320000000001
bubbles during the exploration age

5408.96 --> 5413.199
yeah

5410.32 --> 5416.199
there's now historical backing for that

5413.199 --> 5416.199
statement

5426.639 --> 5431.76
yeah oh oh now yeah discard the source

5429.12 --> 5433.92
oh now oh wiki didn't

5431.76 --> 5436.719
the wiki didn't say what you wanted it

5433.92 --> 5439.84
to say oh now you could just dude just

5436.719 --> 5443.199
dump it yeah yeah

5439.84 --> 5443.1990000000005
don't mind if i then

5443.52 --> 5448.8
add like the coriolis terrestrial

5446.159 --> 5452.4
coriolis deviation

5448.8 --> 5455.4400000000005
claim of wiki with that dump it with the

5452.4 --> 5459.719
wikipedia then too right

5455.44 --> 5459.719
be careful not to straw many

5464.639 --> 5467.84
that's hilarious

5466.32 --> 5469.44
i don't even know who you are you just

5467.84 --> 5472.4800000000005
came in

5469.44 --> 5474.96
obviously triggered at being revealed to

5472.48 --> 5478.08
be wrong because you were probably on

5474.96 --> 5480.639
that side where you were backing these

5478.08 --> 5482.88
[ __ ] claims from anti-flag earthers

5480.639 --> 5484.400000000001
that you've always used bubble sections

5482.88 --> 5486.639
no you didn't

5484.4 --> 5489.12
they didn't exist yet

5486.639 --> 5491.84
they're only used for aircraft and we

5489.12 --> 5494.639
know this now you can't [ __ ] fool us

5491.84 --> 5497.12
with your [ __ ] anymore even on a

5494.639 --> 5499.04
temporary scale yeah

5497.12 --> 5502.679
it's over

5499.04 --> 5502.679
we know now

5525.84 --> 5530.96
it's ironic by the way

5529.04 --> 5534.639
the title of the show

5530.96 --> 5534.639
and then we end up talking about this

5539.76 --> 5544.159000000001
yeah for those that

5542.0 --> 5546.4
don't understand the title i got it from

5544.159 --> 5548.638999999999
made by jim bob he's introduced just a

5546.4 --> 5551.759999999999
new running joke

5548.639 --> 5553.92
based on the accent

5551.76 --> 5555.52
of certain nasa

5553.92 --> 5556.639
employers

5555.52 --> 5559.52
right

5556.639 --> 5562.56
and they they put on like it's like an

5559.52 --> 5565.1990000000005
american accent and they typically say

5562.56 --> 5565.1990000000005
major

5567.36 --> 5572.239
yeah and jim bob is finding all kinds of

5569.52 --> 5576.639
hilarious

5572.239 --> 5578.4
video examples from nasa and like public

5576.639 --> 5580.2390000000005
things where it really stands out that

5578.4 --> 5583.759999999999
they put on

5580.239 --> 5585.44
like a measuring type of accent

5583.76 --> 5587.1990000000005
when they're when they're engaging in

5585.44 --> 5589.5199999999995
techno babble

5587.199 --> 5592.159
it's hilarious

5589.52 --> 5595.120000000001
i'm wildly amused by that

5592.159 --> 5595.12
during his streams

5598.639 --> 5602.679
hey better troon

5615.6 --> 5620.159000000001
right but i am going to round out the

5617.28 --> 5620.159

anti-flat earther that just got caught

5642.639 --> 5647.4400000000005
with another lie you tried to roll out

5645.12 --> 5650.719

5647.44 --> 5652.48
and now i found the cure
