1.34 --> 12.69
John that died yeah my internet

4.95 --> 15.678999999999998
connection are you done over an hour now

12.69 --> 15.678999999999998
mm-hmm

20.07 --> 26.52
yeah welcome back people sorry for that

22.66 --> 30.63
my internet connection just broke again

26.52 --> 30.63
so where were we

33.879 --> 41.23
done oh man sorry wonderul you worry a

37.96 --> 43.329
little something and then I'll just sign

41.23 --> 45.01
yeah all those explanations for how

43.329 --> 46.51
other vision works with the black

45.01 --> 48.64
surface and horizon it's not enough to

46.51 --> 51.489
explain all the obstruction well I think

48.64 --> 53.649
happens yeah it is not for me that's all

51.489 --> 55.36
I'm sorry alright okay well here's

53.649 --> 58.39
another thing okay if you assume that

55.36 --> 61.659
all this obstruction is somehow related

58.39 --> 65.399
to the geometrics of the Earth's surface

61.659 --> 70.56
okay yeah right so how do you explain

65.399 --> 72.97
the linear relation between the

70.56 --> 76.869
obstruction height of the objects being

72.97 --> 79.42
obstructed versus the distance how do

76.869 --> 82.39
you explain the linear relation of the

79.42 --> 85.78
obstruction versus the distance if the

82.39 --> 89.619
earth is curved I don't know really what

85.78 --> 94.659
that question means it means that as you

89.619 --> 96.429
go if you look further away things you

94.659 --> 99.10000000000001
see further away yeah they become

96.429 --> 102.549
obstructed from the bottom up that has a

99.1 --> 104.94999999999999
very specific relation in how much of an

102.549 --> 107.17
object is obstructed from the bottom up

104.95 --> 109.27000000000001
and the further away you go

107.17 --> 112.81
that amount of things that are

109.27 --> 115.06
obstructed become bigger and the

112.81 --> 120.09
relation between the distance and the

115.06 --> 121.27
amount of obstruction is linear oh oh

120.09 --> 123.28
okay

121.27 --> 125.439
yeah I never looked into that well I

123.28 --> 129.82
have I've been saying it for over a year

125.439 --> 132.79
oh I'm sure yeah I am sure debate saying

129.82 --> 135.19
it on my hangout describing that good

132.79 --> 137.53
it's those gonna make up my explanation

135.19 --> 142.299
for how that's art but do you understand

137.53 --> 144.549
the implications of this uh yeah well

142.299 --> 146.5
done Arnie I don't agree it will always

144.549 --> 150.06900000000002
be linear because we know it's variable

146.5 --> 151.66
with refraction and no no no no no no no

150.069 --> 154.72
but that's not the same thing look

151.66 --> 158.2
things can vary in the amount of what is

154.72 --> 161.23
obstructed but the relation between the

158.2 --> 163.38899999999998
total amount of percentage of things

161.23 --> 164.67999999999998
being obstructed the height of what is

163.389 --> 167.92000000000002
obstructed

164.68 --> 170.43900000000002
and the distance and then the

167.92 --> 172.95899999999997
obstruction becoming more is always

170.439 --> 175.9
linear so the entire thing can be

172.959 --> 178.239
influenced by atmospherical changes

175.9 --> 180.4
whatever but the relation is going to

178.239 --> 181.9
remain linear is it supposed to be

180.4 --> 184.989
nonlinear on a globe then it's always

181.9 --> 188.5
yeah that's right if you're looking over

184.989 --> 191.049
a case fear achill surface the

188.5 --> 194.829
obstruction heights which is supposedly

191.049 --> 197.29000000000002
curvature should increase exponentially

194.829 --> 199.59900000000002
I see what you're saying yeah I got it

197.29 --> 203.409
I'll have to ask some small globus to

199.599 --> 204.97
explain that for that well I guess you

203.409 --> 209.019
have to prove that it's fully linear

204.97 --> 212.5
before it's not that hard to do that you

209.019 --> 215.56
just take every single example yeah and

212.5 --> 218.23
you just put it together and yeah soon

215.56 --> 220.209
as you get like officials over 200 miles

218.23 --> 222.909
away and everything and you see like oh

220.209 --> 226.48
yeah roughly this height roughly this

222.909 --> 228.63899999999998
amount is obstructed yeah you can put

226.48 --> 231.60899999999998
that next to other observations and

228.639 --> 233.049
about how much of that is then

231.609 --> 235.06
obstructed and you put it all together

233.049 --> 239.76000000000002
I'll guarantee you you're gonna see a

235.06 --> 247.349
linear graph well I'd like to say that

239.76 --> 247.349
under scrutiny I guarantee it

256.389 --> 262.289
so yeah obstruction is not curvature

259.12 --> 262.289
it's not

264.669 --> 272.60999999999996
you think this would work with sunsets

266.59 --> 276.18899999999996
as well it's no relation because sunsets

272.61 --> 278.409
it's it's just optical we don't know how

276.189 --> 280.84000000000003
far bigger so I guess so weak so hard to

278.409 --> 284.979
quantify no no that's not what we don't

280.84 --> 288.78
know we know it has no distance it has

284.979 --> 290.59
no size it's a purely optical phenomenon

288.78 --> 292.96
holographic in nature

290.59 --> 296.61999999999995
it's in some ways it's a visual and

292.96 --> 302.19
that's it I guess

296.62 --> 302.19
so in some ways now in all ways

305.309 --> 309.119
where it's more than an optical

306.629 --> 312.149
phenomena when it burns your honor no no

309.119 --> 315.29900000000004
doesn't there's some light that hits

312.149 --> 316.679
your skin burnt you yeah that's not but

315.299 --> 318.839
we know that's the light coming from the

316.679 --> 321.56899999999996
starting over krei sure know your know

318.839 --> 323.579
it oh you know is that sunlight comes

321.569 --> 325.589
from the direction where you see that

323.579 --> 328.379
apparent Sun disk that's enough for most

325.589 --> 330.779
human beings yeah enough to draw a

328.379 --> 332.999
presumptuous conclusion I know people

330.779 --> 335.159
are love to do that we always we have to

332.999 --> 335.96900000000005
no you don't have to but you do it

335.159 --> 338.30899999999997
anyway

335.969 --> 341.159
because of physicality assumption bias

338.309 --> 343.619
right humans do humans want to

341.159 --> 345.36
conceptualize things that are easy so it

343.619 --> 348.41900000000004
doesn't take up too much space in their

345.36 --> 351.629
head so they can use the remaining space

348.419 --> 354.329
for the useless trivialities that they

351.629 --> 355.91900000000004
do let me give you an example you make

354.329 --> 357.209
presumptions like the fish oil you're

355.919 --> 359.06899999999996
you're presuming it's the official

357.209 --> 362.969
that's making you less depressed and I

359.069 --> 364.529
did it because they tested its effects

362.969 --> 365.879
of less depression have happened at the

364.529 --> 367.349
same time you've been taking fish oil

365.879 --> 368.84900000000005
like just like the sunlight seems to

367.349 --> 373.36899999999997
come from the same direction as the Sun

368.849 --> 373.36899999999997
so you presumed that's the cause I

375.889 --> 382.319
tested it

377.159 --> 387.389
it's actually I take it it goes away it

382.319 --> 390.059
comes back we did that with Sun but I'm

387.389 --> 392.129
not disputing that sunlight is coming

390.059 --> 395.759
from the direction of the apparent Sun

392.129 --> 397.619
disc right right but we're not proof

395.759 --> 400.199
that's not proof or anything it's not

397.619 --> 402.509
proof that's a physical object I'm not

400.199 --> 405.269
disputing that the depression stops as

402.509 --> 406.649
you take fish all I'm saying you know

405.269 --> 411.149
it's just a concept that that's the

406.649 --> 415.349
cause the cause no it just helps it go

411.149 --> 417.929
away that's for me for my metabolism at

415.349 --> 420.739
least and hearing a lot of other people

417.929 --> 422.51899999999995
that say the same thing so after your

420.739 --> 424.799
experiments and evidence you're

422.519 --> 426.899
presupposing that's gonna be the course

424.799 --> 429.38899999999995
from all the inference no I did use it

426.899 --> 431.339
and I use it practically yeah that's

429.389 --> 433.439
what we did with the Sun was I know you

431.339 --> 435.239
don't you presume it is a physical

433.439 --> 437.309
object because you're too stupid to

435.239 --> 438.34999999999997
imagine that it might not be the

437.309 --> 440.99
physicality

438.35 --> 442.55
the assumption by the same thing we

440.99 --> 444.38
deduce the law and he coming from that

442.55 --> 448.1
direction is coming from actually that

444.38 --> 450.74
thing now you did use and you assume

448.1 --> 453.49
that it is coming from a thing because

450.74 --> 456.23
you can't imagine that need not to be

453.49 --> 459.98
because you can't imagine that something

456.23 --> 464.09000000000003
like that may be coming by other means

459.98 --> 467.03000000000003
than from a apparent visualized imagined

464.09 --> 468.95
lamp out there in some way because

467.03 --> 471.40999999999997
that's all you can do here it's like Oh

468.95 --> 474.77
a lamp lamp light comes from there it's

471.41 --> 477.59000000000003
just like the Sun it's not the Sun is

474.77 --> 480.2
not that doesn't work that way and you

477.59 --> 484.15999999999997
can prove it you can prove it by how

480.2 --> 486.17
light for example crepuscular rays come

484.16 --> 489.29
through clouds you see it hitting the

486.17 --> 491.78000000000003
landscape then at the same time another

489.29 --> 494.12
person a few miles away look at the

491.78 --> 497.86999999999995
exact same clouds at the exact same spot

494.12 --> 500.39
there's no crepuscular rays come through

497.87 --> 504.35
those clouds on those locations and

500.39 --> 507.11
there's a very very telling proof it's

504.35 --> 509.81
not a physical object in a physical

507.11 --> 511.82
location would you argue that the

509.81 --> 515.0
moonlight being cold isn't necessarily

511.82 --> 521.4689999999999
coming from the moon and it's coming

515.0 --> 524.09
from the moon direction so light based

521.469 --> 528.0400000000001
shouts of Voynich who's calling me thick

524.09 --> 528.0400000000001
but won't come on on debate

531.149 --> 535.1
don't need to I can hello yeah easy

539.48 --> 543.749
yeah I don't really debate anymore I

541.74 --> 545.73
just say but we know this this is what

543.749 --> 548.73
science says people have looked into it

545.73 --> 552.5690000000001
we've decided all right well yeah

548.73 --> 554.5790000000001
consensus doesn't make reality religion

552.569 --> 556.8
you believe the second law of

554.579 --> 558.8889999999999
thermodynamics is definitely true but

556.8 --> 562.43
the law of gravitation is definitely not

558.889 --> 565.889
the law of gravitation is not a law

562.43 --> 568.29
well I call it Lord honor and they call

565.889 --> 572.22
it but it's not do you think the second

568.29 --> 576.779
law of thermodynamics is yeah hmm that's

572.22 --> 578.97
quite don't just uh picky fickle it's

576.779 --> 581.309
very simple you can actually prove that

578.97 --> 583.7090000000001
it is there and kind of disprove it

581.309 --> 584.939
gravity is another matter because we

583.709 --> 586.529
have relative density and that's

584.939 --> 588.7489999999999
scientifically provable well that

586.529 --> 591.149
doesn't dictate a direction does it

588.749 --> 594.149
relevancy doesn't mean to

591.149 --> 595.949
it does to explain it doesn't find a

594.149 --> 598.019
phenomena or we observe it needs to

595.949 --> 601.3789999999999
explain a direction but no it doesn't it

598.019 --> 603.87
doesn't need to it's not required is no

601.379 --> 605.639
it's not we observe a directions that

603.87 --> 607.35
doesn't matter that you observe it you

605.639 --> 609.48
you observe you have a nail on your

607.35 --> 611.5400000000001
finger it's not relevant it's not

609.48 --> 615.6
required okay

611.54 --> 617.79
you don't hang the Nile and the finger

615.6 --> 620.37
is relevant don't red herring the [ __ ]

617.79 --> 624.12
out of that okay it's not required I

620.37 --> 626.339
know you want it too okay because you

624.12 --> 632.24
have to have some kind of grip it's not

626.339 --> 632.24
necessary it just is

632.54 --> 636.11
I just I find that fickle that you

634.73 --> 637.94
believe the second or third on

636.11 --> 639.74
thermodynamics is the law and correct

637.94 --> 643.3100000000001
but the law of gravitation isn't a law

639.74 --> 645.53
and isn't correct it's kind of picky and

643.31 --> 647.8599999999999
choosey like well I think the law of

645.53 --> 652.22
gravitation is based on fraudulent

647.86 --> 655.82
evidence because if there was a law of

652.22 --> 657.89
gravity in my old-fashioned way that

655.82 --> 660.0200000000001
would say okay yeah there is an apparent

657.89 --> 666.29
force disequilibrium downwards at all

660.02 --> 668.84
times then I'd say yeah sure I'll go

666.29 --> 671.03
with that doesn't mean that there is a

668.84 --> 672.74
gravity force and that there is some

671.03 --> 674.4499999999999
kind of cause to it because it can all

672.74 --> 676.91
be explained through relative density

674.45 --> 679.34
but I say yeah there is apparently a

676.91 --> 680.87
downward acceleration force like effect

679.34 --> 684.2
present at all times

680.87 --> 686.6
yeah rather than that could be hey take

684.2 --> 689.3000000000001
that as a law we need a fourth doesn't

686.6 --> 691.82
mean there's actually a force presence

689.3 --> 693.9499999999999
called gravity that is caused by mass

691.82 --> 695.48
being attracted by all the mass no I'm

693.95 --> 697.73
not talking about the cause but we need

695.48 --> 700.49
a force to explain the directional I

697.73 --> 702.8000000000001
need it we do no you don't need it

700.49 --> 705.62
relevancy works in a specific direction

702.8 --> 707.63
right so we need some way to explain why

705.62 --> 709.55
that direction and that's grammar you

707.63 --> 712.46
don't you don't be there you dad to make

709.55 --> 714.7099999999999
it work you don't need the interaction

712.46 --> 716.7800000000001
to make it work that's what it's about

714.71 --> 719.0
it's about you know making it

716.78 --> 722.48
scientifically provable and you don't

719.0 --> 724.04
need direction for it if you stop at the

722.48 --> 725.09
movement a relative density you haven't

724.04 --> 726.53
explained the whole thing you haven't

725.09 --> 729.49
explained why that direction of movement

726.53 --> 731.81
that's not relevant is really it's not

729.49 --> 734.1800000000001
something that we are relevant to make

731.81 --> 739.52
it scientifically proven it helps us

734.18 --> 741.68
survive doesn't have any relation with

739.52 --> 743.96
the relative density being

741.68 --> 749.2399999999999
scientifically proven it's how we don't

743.96 --> 751.6700000000001
flow away and die doesn't matter it's

749.24 --> 754.82
not relevant it's not required to make

751.67 --> 756.8
it scientifically proven and that's it

754.82 --> 758.24
and yeah there is more to it there's so

756.8 --> 760.5799999999999
much more to it all these aberrations

758.24 --> 763.88
all these effects or what is actually

760.58 --> 767.899
going on what causes relative density

763.88 --> 769.699
it just doesn't matter are you

767.899 --> 772.97
personally that's what I make it not

769.699 --> 775.49
proven it maybe something is proven when

772.97 --> 778.0400000000001
it is proven it may not be the answer to

775.49 --> 781.819
everything but it may definitely be the

778.04 --> 783.98
answer to that phenomena so you don't

781.819 --> 785.959
care what causes the direction of the

783.98 --> 789.23
relevancy of course I do but it's not

785.959 --> 791.63
relevant to relative density being

789.23 --> 793.339
scientifically provable oh no I know

791.63 --> 796.639
that's provable but that doesn't explain

793.339 --> 798.5600000000001
why that direction of it yeah so we need

796.639 --> 799.91
to study more don't we to find out the

798.56 --> 803.149
reason for the direction of the relative

799.91 --> 805.9399999999999
go ahead what we have and the answer is

803.149 --> 808.579
gravity yeah but gravity can be proven

805.94 --> 811.7900000000001
it can't be Pro it can be proven you ass

808.579 --> 812.8389999999999
you can't prove it you can ferry it stop

811.79 --> 815.7199999999999
it [ __ ]

812.839 --> 818.6300000000001
you can't ferry it very near is the

815.72 --> 820.73
requirement we pretty see them for

818.63 --> 823.009
something being scientifically provable

820.73 --> 826.8190000000001
you can't prove it you can't claim it

823.009 --> 829.49
it's not the answer okay we haven't

826.819 --> 831.86
following ghosts I won't call it proof

829.49 --> 834.11
I'll say we have evidence of the force

831.86 --> 836.12
and the effect don't we do who know you

834.11 --> 839.24
don't you are the evidence you know

836.12 --> 841.55
proof of a force the direction of the

839.24 --> 842.3
way I've been championing gravity for

841.55 --> 845.5089999999999
half a year

842.3 --> 847.79
you don't have proof of a force the

845.509 --> 851.259
direction of the force I just say

847.79 --> 855.88
evidence parents this equilibrium

851.259 --> 862.639
parents parents a parent not actual

855.88 --> 866.329
parents there's a lot of things to

862.639 --> 869.389
suggest a force yeah a parent's not

866.329 --> 873.7399999999999
actual apparent force a parent's that's

869.389 --> 876.35
right not actual a parent is a

873.74 --> 878.99
department if you want yeah because it's

876.35 --> 881.99
exactly what it is still no cure

878.99 --> 884.5600000000001
it's a parent still helps us yeah can

881.99 --> 888.939
help you a lot doesn't help if you

884.56 --> 888.939
mistake it for being actual though

890.699 --> 900.579
is there any other apparent forces that

893.26 --> 904.24
aren't actual it's quite abstract

900.579 --> 907.9899999999999
thinking underlie I wanted to say it's

904.24 --> 910.48
the same thing not that I know of isn't

907.99 --> 913.6
that good enough there may be an

910.48 --> 916.149
apparent force could be a nuclear

913.6 --> 918.4590000000001
fission for example it's an apparent

916.149 --> 922.839
force enough to call it a force still no

918.459 --> 924.67
it's not just a pair it's an appearance

922.839 --> 930.6990000000001
don't you understand the word of a

924.67 --> 931.3499999999999
parent appearances not literally real do

930.699 --> 933.699
you get it

931.35 --> 937.089
okay so would you be happy if I said

933.699 --> 940.959
we've proved the appearance of a force

937.089 --> 943.57
oh yeah okay let's settle on that then

940.959 --> 946.5999999999999
right that's that's the appearance of

943.57 --> 949.029
that authority in apparent equilibrium

946.6 --> 951.01
it's most probably the answer to why we

949.029 --> 953.079
don't need a container in the sky no

951.01 --> 954.76
it's on their form and even work

953.079 --> 957.069
theoretically I've tried to explain that

954.76 --> 960.16
many many times the appearance Apparel

957.069 --> 963.25
force is equilibrium is a constant it's

960.16 --> 965.4399999999999
a constant gradual push on matter it's

963.25 --> 968.17
not a container it's a push well

965.44 --> 969.6990000000001
opposing that weak force it's even

968.17 --> 973.3499999999999
officially considered a weak force

969.699 --> 978.04
gravity right that apparent weak force

973.35 --> 978.399
pushing on all that gas it can't contain

978.04 --> 982.569
it

978.399 --> 986.23
it can only slow it down as it explodes

982.569 --> 988.54
out into the fast outer space yeah

986.23 --> 991.24
that's all right it can't contain it it

988.54 --> 995.9699999999999
can only slow it down gradually very

991.24 --> 999.279
gradually that's gonna make maybe rough

995.97 --> 1001.0500000000001
sizing up 5% difference in house I'm not

999.279 --> 1002.97
gonna take for it all to get sucked out

1001.05 --> 1004.579
doesn't some of the atmosphere escape

1002.97 --> 1008.85
into space isn't that part of the model

1004.579 --> 1010.8889999999999
no that's what they say the Granby

1008.85 --> 1014.13
atmosphere is escaping it's all [ __ ]

1010.889 --> 1017.279
if that'll happen we notice we'd noticed

1014.13 --> 1019.68
instantly if pressure decreases have you

1017.279 --> 1020.35
ever been in the vacuum chamber and just

1019.68 --> 1024.7
having to press

1020.35 --> 1027.85
slightly decreased haft you're no you

1024.7 --> 1030.64
damn well know material properties

1027.85 --> 1033.9699999999998
change instantly if today I find us now

1030.64 --> 1035.5600000000002
alright my sphere is created or are they

1033.97 --> 1037.24
saying we're literally being suffocated

1035.56 --> 1040.87
over a long period of time well they do

1037.24 --> 1044.2
claim that because of gas and fire and

1040.87 --> 1047.59
[ __ ] more comes out but that that could

1044.2 --> 1049.99
never work that could that could never

1047.59 --> 1052.33
balance out the actual loss that would

1049.99 --> 1054.7
happen if the earth was an open

1052.33 --> 1056.8
container and gas pressure could yeah

1054.7 --> 1059.2
would this purse there is some

1056.8 --> 1062.62
explanations for but in your opinion it

1059.2 --> 1064.8400000000001
would still go slowly disappear well

1062.62 --> 1067.57
entropy the need for gas pressure to

1064.84 --> 1070.6499999999999
expand with a container present is one

1067.57 --> 1073.21
of these strongest things ever

1070.65 --> 1077.8300000000002
demonstrate this just take a vacuum

1073.21 --> 1079.75
chamber put it next put a gate in it

1077.83 --> 1080.9099999999999
into another chamber that's under high

1079.75 --> 1086.38
pressure

1080.91 --> 1088.0600000000002
put some floating paint particles so you

1086.38 --> 1094.3600000000001
can actually see what's going on in

1088.06 --> 1097.0
there and open the gate boom extremely

1094.36 --> 1099.6999999999998
violent instant displacement okay it's

1097.0 --> 1103.03
one of the strongest things out there is

1099.7 --> 1104.8
you can't do it yeah see when we're

1103.03 --> 1107.8
going to do it there's no setup that'll

1104.8 --> 1109.36
allow an open earth container and I

1107.8 --> 1111.46
think it's above my head when we get to

1109.36 --> 1113.29
entropy and all of that so I would go

1111.46 --> 1116.8
back to saying no one's ever found

1113.29 --> 1119.47
evidence of a sky container we don't

1116.8 --> 1121.59
know probably has oh it could be hidden

1119.47 --> 1124.0
but yes there isn't any but they don't

1121.59 --> 1126.49
people that are in control obviously

1124.0 --> 1129.91
don't want to share that because then

1126.49 --> 1132.88
they can't put their giant space theater

1129.91 --> 1134.95
up Ritter ISS and know we're going to

1132.88 --> 1136.42
Mars and look at the robot go no more

1134.95 --> 1139.0
yeah they couldn't do all of that they

1136.42 --> 1142.66
couldn't get the legendary highest

1139.0 --> 1144.4
budget in human history if they'd share

1142.66 --> 1146.92
that you can actually go there because

1144.4 --> 1149.26
there is a sky container so it's very

1146.92 --> 1150.43
simple like I could see that that's why

1149.26 --> 1152.2
I like five because the conspiracy

1150.43 --> 1154.1200000000001
intrigues me

1152.2 --> 1158.77
thank you by the way Daniel field for

1154.12 --> 1164.79
the one pound 20 super chat donation

1158.77 --> 1167.59
thanks very much oh yeah oh and I'll

1164.79 --> 1169.33
Riley setup you can do stream labs which

1167.59 --> 1172.54
is a site where people can donate to you

1169.33 --> 1174.73
and goggle won't take 33% okay

1172.54 --> 1177.07
well I'll take my god I'll take PayPal

1174.73 --> 1179.14
donations and then Google gets nothing

1177.07 --> 1180.61
either so yeah but you can have this as

1179.14 --> 1182.7700000000002
a little link where people click press

1180.61 --> 1184.2099999999998
on easy and it's the same way as playing

1182.77 --> 1185.26
through Google you'll get less of them

1184.21 --> 1187.03
because people don't know how to do it

1185.26 --> 1190.05
straight away but in the end you'll get

1187.03 --> 1193.03
more money okay

1190.05 --> 1196.44
direct I'll get Riley to tell you about

1193.03 --> 1200.56
direct PayPal if you go to PayPal me

1196.44 --> 1203.53
PayPal dot me slash Arwen then yeah you

1200.56 --> 1205.27
can also do that they like they like

1203.53 --> 1206.77
seeing their name pop up in the chat the

1205.27 --> 1208.15
PayPal doesn't do that but this stream

1206.77 --> 1211.0
Maps thing it can come up on screen and

1208.15 --> 1216.48
say thank you so and so and in type or

1211.0 --> 1219.31
whatever that's what they do on Twitch I

1216.48 --> 1221.59
don't know about other platforms yet I

1219.31 --> 1223.87
have seen twitch it does seem kind of

1221.59 --> 1228.22
appealing although mostly directed at

1223.87 --> 1229.87
gamers yeah but yeah you know some point

1228.22 --> 1232.1200000000001
especially if I get a better mic a

1229.87 --> 1234.4899999999998
better set up all that stuff I will

1232.12 --> 1237.2199999999998
probably try to branch out to other

1234.49 --> 1239.65
platforms as well and like Simoes stream

1237.22 --> 1240.79
on different platforms I'd love to try

1239.65 --> 1243.2800000000002
it out see if that works

1240.79 --> 1244.8999999999999
though I will need some assistance I can

1243.28 --> 1246.31
send you a video for stream lapse it's

1244.9 --> 1250.96
just a way of getting the money without

1246.31 --> 1253.87
Google taking that the third well look

1250.96 --> 1256.96
in this case Google taking a lot of

1253.87 --> 1259.75
money that's one thing but on the other

1256.96 --> 1261.97
hand Google is he it's just the biggest

1259.75 --> 1265.69
platform out there and that is its

1261.97 --> 1268.03
advantages as well yes so that's a

1265.69 --> 1270.73
little go with it I'll still go with

1268.03 --> 1273.69
Google and look super chats it's still

1270.73 --> 1277.09
cool but yeah if you want to support me

1273.69 --> 1278.53
more directly then PayPal works a lot

1277.09 --> 1280.3899999999999
better because anything I'm getting it

1278.53 --> 1282.12
through a super chat now is still in the

1280.39 --> 1285.15
waiting row I can't actually

1282.12 --> 1287.549
access it still have to wait for

1285.15 --> 1290.88
probably like a month or two or maybe

1287.549 --> 1293.37
even more before my advertisement

1290.88 --> 1296.669
revenue fills up to that seventy dollar

1293.37 --> 1301.32
limit and only after that point can I

1296.669 --> 1302.7
actually withdraw the superjet so yeah

1301.32 --> 1307.49
if you want to help me in a more direct

1302.7 --> 1310.529
sense then PayPal definitely helps more

1307.49 --> 1313.279
all right okay I'll look into your link

1310.529 --> 1317.64
that you would just post it stream lapse

1313.279 --> 1318.84
looks kind of interesting let's see you

1317.64 --> 1320.7
might find a better video that's just

1318.84 --> 1323.57
the one that came out when I starts out

1320.7 --> 1323.57
start up on YouTube

1328.26 --> 1334.65
all right bookmark that you can get like

1332.82 --> 1336.6
a little trigger so that when it happens

1334.65 --> 1339.75
it comes up on screen under your name

1336.6 --> 1342.4499999999998
and your your webcam saying thank you

1339.75 --> 1346.11
for supporting our in oil then it says

1342.45 --> 1348.54
their name all right I'll check it out

1346.11 --> 1351.81
it's not a big video I don't know what

1348.54 --> 1354.6599999999999
to talk about now I don't know we talked

1351.81 --> 1357.1699999999998
about a lot of things so I think I'm

1354.66 --> 1360.51
gonna round out the show or go in mine

1357.17 --> 1363.03
so yeah thank you for coming and being

1360.51 --> 1365.58
part of the an actual Flat Earth

1363.03 --> 1371.72
discussion busco you've been you've been

1365.58 --> 1371.72
a good sport so thank you for coming

1376.02 --> 1383.48
so guys I hope you were amused it's

1379.38 --> 1386.3700000000001
lasted an hour and a half think yeah

1383.48 --> 1390.78
wait the back should say started

1386.37 --> 1393.9899999999998
streaming 22 minutes ago what what's

1390.78 --> 1400.1
going on is that because it broke off or

1393.99 --> 1405.84
something this is weird huh

1400.1 --> 1408.1789999999999
anyway yeah I'm gonna round out the show

1405.84 --> 1412.02
so thanks everyone in chat for coming

1408.179 --> 1414.0590000000002
and yeah see me talk about lots of

1412.02 --> 1417.12
things and then having a small flatter

1414.059 --> 1421.29
debate with don't threaten UK here it's

1417.12 --> 1422.9099999999999
kind of fun and yeah please up for the

1421.29 --> 1425.19
video if you like the down folder if you

1422.91 --> 1426.78
are true whatever and make sure to

1425.19 --> 1429.059
subscribe to my channel and hit the bell

1426.78 --> 1431.28
notification so you know when I'm going

1429.059 --> 1433.98
live which can be sometimes a little bit

1431.28 --> 1436.32
early when I feel like it usually it's

1433.98 --> 1441.53
just two o'clock Amsterdam time 1

1436.32 --> 1447.47
o'clock London time between 6 and 10

1441.53 --> 1450.26
American time and about 2 o'clock

1447.47 --> 1453.3500000000001
Australian time something like that

1450.26 --> 1458.27
so yeah I will be back tomorrow with

1453.35 --> 1463.2099999999998
flatters earlybird number 121 11 times

1458.27 --> 1465.95
11 and yeah we'll see what happens then

1463.21 --> 1467.69
is anything oh yeah if you want to be

1465.95 --> 1471.049
part of the panel you can add me on

1467.69 --> 1473.1200000000001
skype and you too can be on my panel

1471.049 --> 1474.9189999999999
having a discussion about all kinds of

1473.12 --> 1476.9899999999998
things we had flat earth for this globe

1474.919 --> 1481.3090000000002
or be dalla

1476.99 --> 1483.53
effect or the synergetics the the dark

1481.309 --> 1486.47
world experience I had

1483.53 --> 1488.6789999999999
alternative medicine stuff mainstream

1486.47 --> 1492.919
media versus alternative media

1488.679 --> 1496.91
geopolitics sovereignty financial

1492.919 --> 1500.24
independence and me thing and knee thing

1496.91 --> 1503.27
and me think I'll talk about everything

1500.24 --> 1506.419
I know something about everything you

1503.27 --> 1507.35
can discuss it with me so come on in and

1506.419 --> 1512.7700000000002
let's do it

1507.35 --> 1516.9099999999999
but yeah let's do it the next time right

1512.77 --> 1521.08
so until the next flatters earlybird

1516.91 --> 1521.0800000000002
keep it flat

1522.14 --> 1552.76
