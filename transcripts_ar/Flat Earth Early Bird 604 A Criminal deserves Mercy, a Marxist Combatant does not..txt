139.04 --> 143.92
i had that sitting in the freezer i

142.08 --> 146.31900000000002

to do that

146.319 --> 151.83999999999997
all right so let's see who is in chat i

yeah yeah i had i was called up this

192.08 --> 198.959
morning by

194.8 --> 201.04000000000002
somebody for the yeah the government

198.959 --> 202.959
complaining about things and i had to

201.04 --> 205.12
fill in certain things i think i got it

202.959 --> 205.12
all

206.08 --> 210.48000000000002
anyway yeah that kind of woke me up and

208.159 --> 212.239
it was very warm anyway so it was

210.48 --> 215.599
probably gonna get up

212.239 --> 217.519
that was at nine o'clock anyway

215.599 --> 218.959
don't make any notes holy [ __ ] i

217.519 --> 222.56
completely forgot to make

218.959 --> 225.599
notes or did i

222.56 --> 227.84
no wait it's monday so yeah i did make

225.599 --> 227.84
notes

234.48 --> 236.959
let's see

238.72 --> 245.04
yeah i thought the show was good

242.48 --> 245.92
did i watch it back i think i did it was

245.04 --> 248.159
just good

245.92 --> 248.159
uh

248.959 --> 252.959
so it's not a lot of other stuff except

250.879 --> 255.35999999999999
for flat earth debates

252.959 --> 257.12
uh restreams and yeah they were good

255.36 --> 260.16
they were from friday and

257.12 --> 263.04
yeah very satisfied about it

260.16 --> 264.40000000000003
and yeah hey i'm proud to say i am

263.04 --> 267.36
really putting myself

264.4 --> 268.0
out there um well you could almost say

267.36 --> 272.8
professional

268.0 --> 272.8
level and at this and i'm satisfied

273.36 --> 276.639
it's so funny to realize and this is

276.08 --> 278.8
like

276.639 --> 280.72
from four years ago when i started up

278.8 --> 283.44
the challenge i got some advice

280.72 --> 285.84000000000003
among other from the aphidwise of course

283.44 --> 287.68
of course he would know that

285.84 --> 290.0
like the most important thing is to

287.68 --> 292.8
really in media

290.0 --> 293.6
is to just connect with everything i was

292.8 --> 297.12
like what how

293.6 --> 297.91900000000004
but how but then i realized yeah i'm

297.12 --> 300.32
already

297.919 --> 301.75899999999996
going to places and that's where i'm

300.32 --> 305.759
connecting and

301.759 --> 307.91900000000004
if i people become

305.759 --> 309.68
comfortable with me around they start to

307.919 --> 311.35999999999996
understand my presence

309.68 --> 314.56
then you can engage further and that's

311.36 --> 317.91900000000004
really it so it's kind of social media

314.56 --> 319.12
going around and i do that and i have

317.919 --> 320.79999999999995
been doing it

319.12 --> 322.479
very persistently and with the flat

320.8 --> 324.0
earth debates and with the scene with

322.479 --> 327.52
the guys with the fellas with the ball

324.0 --> 328.16
busters and yeah the funny thing is just

327.52 --> 331.039
like whoa

328.16 --> 332.40000000000003
what i actually set out to do four years

331.039 --> 336.0
ago

332.4 --> 336.0
i've absolutely achieved that

336.16 --> 341.6
in in limited fashion because yeah you

339.12 --> 343.28000000000003
could go a lot broader but then you have

341.6 --> 343.84000000000003
all the consequences and you have to

343.28 --> 347.35999999999996
kind of

343.84 --> 348.88
adapt a little bit too much for my

347.36 --> 351.28000000000003
comfort

348.88 --> 352.479
like yeah my qualities would be lost if

351.28 --> 354.79999999999995
i did that

352.479 --> 357.68
but yeah i'm here and i'm glad about it

354.8 --> 359.919
so that's good to know

357.68 --> 359.919
uh

362.4 --> 366.56
yeah i watch the movies it's weird it's

365.36 --> 372.319
weird [ __ ] like

366.56 --> 375.84
again vision stuff i watched the movie

372.319 --> 375.84000000000003
and i really recognized it

376.24 --> 380.88
like literal scenes that it's just it's

379.12 --> 382.479
so freaky

380.88 --> 385.36
oh that works sometimes that just

382.479 --> 387.919
certain scenes i've seen

385.36 --> 391.199
they yeah when i bump into them it's

387.919 --> 393.28
like a deja vu but not just a deja vu

391.199 --> 394.56
you know people have deja vus you know

393.28 --> 397.039
everybody knows this

394.56 --> 398.24
a lot of people have that just see

397.039 --> 400.08
something and you're like whoa i

398.24 --> 401.759
recognize this you know it's almost like

400.08 --> 405.35999999999996
i've been here before

401.759 --> 408.08000000000004
but you can't place that well with me

405.36 --> 410.47900000000004
i guess i can place it and i can

408.08 --> 412.24
literally remember the experience and

410.479 --> 414.24
from what perspective and what it was

412.24 --> 417.28000000000003
like

414.24 --> 419.199
and so yeah it's it's not a very

417.28 --> 421.039
pleasant way to experience such

419.199 --> 425.199
situations by the way

421.039 --> 427.12
but is not really important

425.199 --> 428.8
figuring it out as i go but i watched a

427.12 --> 432.8
movie called flight

428.8 --> 436.479
and about uh yeah an alcoholism

432.8 --> 440.16
very much but a drama based thing

436.479 --> 443.36
about a pilot and it was a

440.16 --> 445.84000000000003
really good movie i thought it was real

443.36 --> 445.84000000000003
it was like

446.72 --> 451.68
in your face [ __ ] it's from 2012 i'd

450.08 --> 453.75899999999996
never seen it before i probably wasn't

451.68 --> 457.199
interested at the time

453.759 --> 462.84000000000003
you know but i don't know if

457.199 --> 465.84000000000003
i thought it was a vengeance on netflix

462.84 --> 465.84
what

469.759 --> 479.84000000000003
i don't wish to insult you but since

473.199 --> 479.84000000000003
you're saying that hm i highly doubt it

480.08 --> 486.31899999999996
i think our tastes uh differ quite some

484.56 --> 489.28000000000003
but yeah i watched that it's a very

486.319 --> 491.36
adult movie literally

489.28 --> 493.52
but it's yeah dan denzel washington

491.36 --> 495.12
that's right

493.52 --> 497.919
i don't know the guy probably has a huge

495.12 --> 501.12
amount of issues with him and all that

497.919 --> 502.4
but the movie i thought that he was very

501.12 --> 507.84000000000003
convincing

502.4 --> 507.84
in the role

512.719 --> 518.8000000000001
okay agm that that makes it sound

515.76 --> 518.8
even more terrible

519.519 --> 524.08
who knows uh

524.32 --> 528.5600000000001
maybe i'm wrong about it it's just that

526.959 --> 531.76
movies that are called like that

528.56 --> 535.8389999999999
don't really appeal to me i find it

531.76 --> 535.8389999999999
very annoying

540.48 --> 544.32
watched westworld again right

545.76 --> 549.12
anyway i watched it it's i thought it

548.8 --> 552.399
was

549.12 --> 554.48
interesting because of also the

552.399 --> 556.0
the guy that made the movie obviously

554.48 --> 559.44
had real

556.0 --> 561.92
did has done real piloting

559.44 --> 562.6400000000001
research and like the procedures of the

561.92 --> 565.1999999999999
cr

562.64 --> 567.12
because that really it was kind of a

565.2 --> 567.6800000000001
look into that little world and i

567.12 --> 570.72
thought

567.68 --> 571.3599999999999
that appealed to me a lot that they paid

570.72 --> 574.839
a lot of

571.36 --> 576.32
careful attention with that you know

574.839 --> 578.1600000000001
that's

576.32 --> 580.32
yeah so that's i thought it was a pretty

578.16 --> 584.3199999999999
good movie and it had some

580.32 --> 586.9590000000001
funny very liberal-ish things in it

584.32 --> 588.9590000000001
it's like this drug dealer guy who was

586.959 --> 591.8389999999999
just a complete clown and

588.959 --> 594.8
he knew it and it but he was funny yet

591.839 --> 599.2
it was uh who's that guy again

594.8 --> 599.1999999999999
he's the same guy that was in the movie

602.079 --> 609.3599999999999
who was like the paranoid

605.12 --> 612.88
gun guy in you know which movie

609.36 --> 616.88
with the dude ah

612.88 --> 616.88
terrible i forgot the name uh

617.04 --> 620.24
i don't know you might get it now does

619.68 --> 623.76
it go

620.24 --> 627.76
uh anyway he was in that as well

623.76 --> 627.76
and yeah

628.079 --> 633.8389999999999
it's a i thought yeah it gripped me

635.76 --> 642.88
oh god oh god

639.519 --> 645.04
yeah hm yeah yeah they shoved it you

642.88 --> 647.279
know what i was watching this movie it

645.04 --> 649.92
ended and i was like

647.279 --> 652.0
man that was heavy man and then they

649.92 --> 652.56
started to auto play that [ __ ] and it's

652.0 --> 656.079
like

652.56 --> 659.04
yeah yeah we're we're doing another

656.079 --> 663.04
classic story tradition and we're

659.04 --> 663.04
changing the lead into a girl

663.519 --> 670.48
get away from me

666.8 --> 672.959
get away just i

670.48 --> 675.12

672.959 --> 677.5189999999999

675.12 --> 678.8
trying to replace a man's role in a

677.519 --> 684.48
freaking movie

678.8 --> 684.4799999999999
it's ah it's gonna kill me

686.72 --> 693.9200000000001
stop doing that it's so annoying

690.959 --> 693.92
get away

698.399 --> 701.68
and i don't know you know maybe they're

700.24 --> 704.48
they're gonna do it they're gonna do

701.68 --> 707.8389999999999

717.36 --> 722.32
example thank you very much

720.32 --> 724.9590000000001

806.079 --> 811.4399999999999
room and i got plans although yeah it's

808.48 --> 813.44
going to be a bit of an issue because

811.44 --> 815.44
there's going to be stuff to basically

813.44 --> 817.6800000000001
transport to my storage but yeah that's

815.44 --> 819.519
not gonna work on a bike

823.22 --> 829.839
[Music]

825.839 --> 829.839
yeah but doing great

838.0 --> 847.04
all right i also watched a documentary

843.279 --> 849.4399999999999
on youtube not related to flat earth was

847.04 --> 856.56
it was historical

849.44 --> 860.32
uh it's from let's see what was again

856.56 --> 862.2399999999999
it was from truth from 2016 so yeah

860.32 --> 863.7600000000001
i don't know it was recommended to me

862.24 --> 865.199
and i thought it was interesting it's a

863.76 --> 868.8389999999999
one hour 10 minute

865.199 --> 872.279
piece presentation

868.839 --> 875.519
of uh

872.279 --> 878.72
1177 bc and what it was like

875.519 --> 880.639
and he's like really doing his best

878.72 --> 883.6
and the funny thing was i thought like

880.639 --> 886.72
oh is is there stuff being left out

883.6 --> 889.44
but no he seemed very

886.72 --> 890.9590000000001
yeah inquisitorial at it and he even

889.44 --> 894.1600000000001
mentioned eventually like the

890.959 --> 896.4799999999999
phoenicians and the jew tribes how they

894.16 --> 898.399
were basically left it's

896.48 --> 899.519
and that there is missing data it just

898.399 --> 903.04
seemed like a

899.519 --> 904.72
a genuine person that was trying to do

903.04 --> 906.16
his best to do it correctly

904.72 --> 908.0790000000001
and i watched it through and it was

906.16 --> 911.76
pretty good

908.079 --> 912.4799999999999
so yeah and it's interesting to compare

911.76 --> 916.399
this

912.48 --> 919.519
to things that well we're being

916.399 --> 922.56
exposed to through the through uh yeah

919.519 --> 924.32
for example martin luther's background

922.56 --> 926.0
group that is doing digging through all

924.32 --> 929.1990000000001
that it's just interesting to

926.0 --> 929.199
cross-reference it all

930.72 --> 935.44
like how do they fit you know narratives

934.079 --> 938.8389999999999
are built

935.44 --> 941.839
on reality by leaving away connections

938.839 --> 941.839
and

942.079 --> 947.8389999999999
yeah maybe replacing elements entirely

945.199 --> 950.0
after everything about the original has

947.839 --> 952.1600000000001
been erased within the story

950.0 --> 954.16
but it's funny because basically

952.16 --> 956.88
everything is always going to be based

954.16 --> 957.199
on rough what really happened so it's

956.88 --> 959.6
just

957.199 --> 960.959
interesting to compare from different

959.6 --> 964.0
perspectives

960.959 --> 967.5189999999999
historical structuring and like see

964.0 --> 970.079
the other version does it really fit

967.519 --> 971.519
does it make sense like does it overlap

970.079 --> 975.199
and it fits

971.519 --> 978.48
it's something that yeah

975.199 --> 980.959
i don't know it's um it's also a

978.48 --> 982.639
sensory thing like it's about the feel

980.959 --> 984.2399999999999
for it because i don't have pure

982.639 --> 986.88
oversight

984.24 --> 989.6
it's just rough it's like a big fractal

986.88 --> 997.8389999999999
to me and i'm not that zoomed in on it

989.6 --> 997.839
but i can see patterns

1002.16 --> 1006.8
yeah martin stallberg i i absolutely

1005.6 --> 1009.519
disagree

1006.8 --> 1010.0
oh wait it's a theory right yeah that's

1009.519 --> 1013.839
a theory

1010.0 --> 1015.92
that's a very it's a theory based on

1013.839 --> 1016.8000000000001
that the mind is deceiving well i could

1015.92 --> 1019.92
tell you

1016.8 --> 1023.04
no i think deja vu's or something else i

1019.92 --> 1026.0
think deja vu's are remnants from

1023.04 --> 1028.72
uh extra dimensional spiritual activity

1026.0 --> 1028.72
of yourself

1030.64 --> 1035.199
like i think that the spirit can be

1032.959 --> 1040.48
drawn into the other dimension

1035.199 --> 1042.959
by god but also by nefarious actions

1040.48 --> 1043.52
and then that leaves marks throughout

1042.959 --> 1046.16
time

1043.52 --> 1046.959
in your life but normally you don't

1046.16 --> 1049.76
remember that

1046.959 --> 1052.4
you just get deja vu sensations it's

1049.76 --> 1054.8799999999999
like it's already happened that's the

1052.4 --> 1057.52
sensation right because it did

1054.88 --> 1059.679
it just did not in the linear time base

1057.52 --> 1061.6
it did on the other side

1059.679 --> 1064.8400000000001
that touched upon this moment and that's

1061.6 --> 1067.12
where it gets close that's my

1064.84 --> 1068.48
generalized conception of what deja vu

1067.12 --> 1081.84
is because that is

1068.48 --> 1081.84
how it seems to work with me

1083.12 --> 1087.4399999999998
right that's funny isn't it

1087.679 --> 1091.919
because your foods are always

1089.12 --> 1096.6399999999999
accompanied by certain sensations

1091.919 --> 1100.7990000000002
it's not just a an idea that has no

1096.64 --> 1102.3200000000002
impact no it is a sensation

1100.799 --> 1104.6399999999999
and it could be all kinds of it could be

1102.32 --> 1107.6789999999999
an airy sensation it could be like

1104.64 --> 1108.4
a flutter ss but it's always some kind

1107.679 --> 1111.76
of feeling

1108.4 --> 1115.44
because that

1111.76 --> 1122.559
energy was probably involved in

1115.44 --> 1125.679
the extra dimensional activity and so

1122.559 --> 1128.96
i can bet you for sure that people that

1125.679 --> 1129.679
truly dwell in darkness really dwell in

1128.96 --> 1131.679
it

1129.679 --> 1133.3600000000001
and that are completely they have no

1131.679 --> 1135.52
more control over their spirit it's in

1133.36 --> 1139.1999999999998
the reins of the machine

1135.52 --> 1141.84
that they might have deja vus as well

1139.2 --> 1142.96
but their deja vus will probably always

1141.84 --> 1147.6789999999999
be horrific

1142.96 --> 1147.679
will always be a sense of dread

1148.0 --> 1152.559
because of where they were with their

1150.16 --> 1152.559
spirit

1156.08 --> 1160.08
and in a way that is kind of a problem

1158.72 --> 1163.84
with me as well because i

1160.08 --> 1166.6399999999999
did i get drawn into the darkness

1163.84 --> 1168.3999999999999
tried to hold on but it did get pushed

1166.64 --> 1171.76
through it like that

1168.4 --> 1172.72
so with me deja vu's are also kind of

1171.76 --> 1174.8799999999999
accompanied by

1172.72 --> 1176.64
a certain level of dread it's not

1174.88 --> 1178.88
overwhelming

1176.64 --> 1181.6000000000001
but it is like a reminder of like where

1178.88 --> 1186.24
i came from in a way

1181.6 --> 1186.24
and it's not good i don't like it

1190.84 --> 1193.84
anyway

1196.08 --> 1199.6
hey guns of nephron r p

1205.679 --> 1212.64
james true and now

1209.28 --> 1217.36
that he is accused of luciferian

1212.64 --> 1217.3600000000001
i don't know i don't know who is that

1218.24 --> 1224.0
i might yeah it sounds vaguely familiar

1221.84 --> 1235.4399999999998
i don't know is that somebody i should

1224.0 --> 1237.76
care about

1235.44 --> 1237.76
uh

1239.919 --> 1242.48
so who

1243.2 --> 1246.0
who what where

1247.2 --> 1251.8400000000001
i don't know who that is i don't

1248.88 --> 1251.8400000000001
recognize the face

1252.22 --> 1255.619
[Music]

1260.4 --> 1264.4
wow he is accused of being a luciferian

1263.6 --> 1267.6
is he

1264.4 --> 1269.3600000000001
by what and who because there's a lot of

1267.6 --> 1271.12
accusations going around if you know

1269.36 --> 1274.4799999999998
what i mean

1271.12 --> 1277.6
people are very easy to just blurt out

1274.48 --> 1279.84
the most horrific accusations

1277.6 --> 1282.1589999999999
just as a standard approach these days

1279.84 --> 1282.1589999999999
so

1284.559 --> 1288.48
he was a few times on the stream with

1287.2 --> 1291.8400000000001
owen benjin when

1288.48 --> 1291.84
was that

1292.88 --> 1296.0800000000002
when did this happen i don't know was

1294.4 --> 1305.8400000000001
this in the in the late stream or

1296.08 --> 1305.84
something i maybe i missed it

1308.64 --> 1315.679
right i don't know i might be mixing

1313.039 --> 1317.6
him up with somebody else but is that

1315.679 --> 1320.159
like the guy that was supposedly that

1317.6 --> 1324.24
ordered blood over the internet

1320.159 --> 1325.5200000000002
is that the guy i'm terrible at names

1324.24 --> 1329.2
because

1325.52 --> 1329.2
i really don't care

1329.6 --> 1335.12
it just doesn't stick so you have to

1332.48 --> 1335.1200000000001
remind me

1335.919 --> 1339.1200000000001
thursday or friday

1340.72 --> 1345.039
no now the guy that he that i'm

1343.2 --> 1346.88
mentioning he talked about that like at

1345.039 --> 1348.64
least two or three weeks ago

1346.88 --> 1350.0800000000002
so i think i missed that if that were

1348.64 --> 1352.4
the case i have no

1350.08 --> 1354.96
literally absolutely no idea who you're

1352.4 --> 1354.96
talking about

1356.88 --> 1363.7600000000002
oh wait

1360.4 --> 1366.5590000000002
is this the guy he had on

1363.76 --> 1366.559
on his show

1367.12 --> 1370.6399999999999
where he put the freaking flower in his

1369.679 --> 1374.0800000000002
hair and

1370.64 --> 1375.76
i tuned out because i thought it was

1374.08 --> 1378.6399999999999
getting kind of gay

1375.76 --> 1378.64
is it that guy

1386.32 --> 1392.0
yes a few right it's him isn't it yeah i

1389.679 --> 1393.6000000000001
yeah he's he's accused of being a

1392.0 --> 1398.64
luciferian

1393.6 --> 1398.6399999999999
well surprise surprise

1399.039 --> 1402.72
yeah no i thought i thought he was

1401.44 --> 1404.559
repulsive

1402.72 --> 1406.72
and i was kind of embarrassed that owen

1404.559 --> 1407.2
benjamin would even get him on but yeah

1406.72 --> 1409.28
it's

1407.2 --> 1410.559
it's his journey man it's his journey of

1409.28 --> 1413.44
discovery so

1410.559 --> 1414.96
hey if he's now turning against him

1413.44 --> 1418.159
that's

1414.96 --> 1420.32
yeah it's about time you know my opinion

1418.159 --> 1420.3200000000002
but

1422.64 --> 1426.48
if that's the guy then i understand who

1425.52 --> 1428.32
we're talking about

1426.48 --> 1430.4
he had long hand hair on the show the

1428.32 --> 1432.8799999999999
photos that google showed me

1430.4 --> 1432.88
he didn't

1442.48 --> 1446.32
are we on the level here because it's

1444.48 --> 1448.88
kind of blurry what i'm reading from

1446.32 --> 1448.8799999999999
chat here

1449.279 --> 1455.2
no long hair did he have no long hair

1452.4 --> 1455.2
oh [ __ ]

1456.08 --> 1459.9189999999999
i might have misremembered that part

1457.679 --> 1462.24
then could have been

1459.919 --> 1463.44
he didn't have long hair but i it felt

1462.24 --> 1465.2
almost like he did

1463.44 --> 1468.799
he reminded me of another guy that had

1465.2 --> 1468.799
long hair that talked similarly

1470.88 --> 1475.6000000000001
i yeah but you know the more you guys

1473.52 --> 1478.1589999999999
are talking about it and the more i'm

1475.6 --> 1480.48
aiming at the wrong people the more i'm

1478.159 --> 1482.96
getting the idea that

1480.48 --> 1484.559
uh i completely missed out on that

1482.96 --> 1486.32
stream probably

1484.559 --> 1501.84
so yeah i have no idea who you're

1486.32 --> 1501.84
talking about

1512.84 --> 1515.84
so

1524.0 --> 1527.6
deja vu at the right place at the right

1526.24 --> 1529.88
time doing the right thing

1527.6 --> 1531.12
maybe yeah that that's a

1529.88 --> 1534.4
self-contradictory

1531.12 --> 1536.0
statement but yeah it could be

1534.4 --> 1539.44
considered as such that

1536.0 --> 1540.799
if you have a extra dimensional

1539.44 --> 1542.88
projection in which

1540.799 --> 1545.52
such a moment is addressed by your

1542.88 --> 1548.24
interdimensional spirit

1545.52 --> 1550.6399999999999
that at least to your spirit it seemed

1548.24 --> 1553.76
to be a decision that was kind of

1550.64 --> 1554.48
final that that moment should happen and

1553.76 --> 1556.72
in that way

1554.48 --> 1558.24
you could consider it being at the right

1556.72 --> 1558.64
place in the right time doing the right

1558.24 --> 1562.559
thing

1558.64 --> 1566.4
according to the mind the idea

1562.559 --> 1569.52
of the spirit that you were in that form

1566.4 --> 1571.44
when that happened so yeah does it mean

1569.52 --> 1572.6399999999999
that it's gonna be at the right end

1571.44 --> 1576.24
though

1572.64 --> 1580.0800000000002
it's just like it was pre

1576.24 --> 1582.08
decided by yourself in a way

1580.08 --> 1584.0
doesn't mean that it's gonna lead to

1582.08 --> 1587.039
something fantastic but it might

1584.0 --> 1590.64
it depends on the bigger context your

1587.039 --> 1590.64
spiritual journey on the other side

1594.4 --> 1601.52
so i guess at that

1598.24 --> 1604.0
yeah what you're saying is correct

1601.52 --> 1604.0
typical

1604.559 --> 1608.559
it's always good to start out in full

1606.32 --> 1609.6789999999999
denial and then in the same sentence at

1608.559 --> 1611.2
the end end up at

1609.679 --> 1614.72
completely agreeing it's always

1611.2 --> 1614.72
interesting when that happens isn't it

1622.159 --> 1628.3200000000002
oh and benjamin said david cut off colin

1624.64 --> 1628.3200000000002
is wiener yeah he said it

1634.48 --> 1641.84
crazy to deny the trinity really why

1638.159 --> 1641.8400000000001
why is that crazy good servant

1646.159 --> 1654.3990000000001
is that because it was decided

1650.08 --> 1656.1589999999999
by a group that's that claimed spiritual

1654.399 --> 1659.12
authority over it

1656.159 --> 1659.1200000000001
over the legacy

1660.159 --> 1669.8400000000001
no i don't think so

1670.24 --> 1677.279
so what what does that matter

1673.919 --> 1680.8400000000001
why does it matter like

1677.279 --> 1683.84
is seeing it in a different way gonna

1680.84 --> 1683.84
matter

1685.039 --> 1687.36
you know

1689.039 --> 1692.48
i i'm in a theorist so i'm simply

1691.279 --> 1697.44
looking at the

1692.48 --> 1700.48
like why why and what is the intention

1697.44 --> 1704.0
and what are the consequences

1700.48 --> 1704.32
was it foreseen and then how was decided

1704.0 --> 1706.48
the

1704.32 --> 1707.76
much deeper etherics is much more

1706.48 --> 1710.32
interesting to me

1707.76 --> 1711.919
than which detail was eventually a

1710.32 --> 1713.6789999999999
thousand years later

1711.919 --> 1715.279
said like you have to say it like this

1713.679 --> 1715.8400000000001
or you will be burned as a freaking

1715.279 --> 1718.88
witch

1715.84 --> 1724.24
okay esoterics it's not

1718.88 --> 1726.96
good it's not good for anything really

1724.24 --> 1728.0
you know it's fine if you want to think

1726.96 --> 1731.3600000000001
of it like that

1728.0 --> 1735.2
and if you want to worship using that

1731.36 --> 1738.24
exoteric system but

1735.2 --> 1739.44
you shouldn't push because you don't

1738.24 --> 1742.159
know

1739.44 --> 1744.48
all you know is what you can understand

1742.159 --> 1747.679
of christ

1744.48 --> 1749.84
and if you connect to the deeper meaning

1747.679 --> 1751.1200000000001
and that deeper meaning cannot be

1749.84 --> 1755.36
unraveled

1751.12 --> 1759.039
or puzzled from the words of the book

1755.36 --> 1762.32
it can only touch you you either

1759.039 --> 1764.0
get it or you don't

1762.32 --> 1766.1589999999999
when you don't you're not ready there's

1764.0 --> 1769.44
something in the way preventing you

1766.159 --> 1773.44
from getting it i don't like to

1769.44 --> 1773.44
dwell on exoterics i don't

1774.72 --> 1780.48
but yeah trinity you know you

1777.919 --> 1782.159
yeah trinity is fine if you want to

1780.48 --> 1785.3600000000001
believe that

1782.159 --> 1788.7990000000002
how and why would it matter what

1785.36 --> 1790.9599999999998
if the trinity was exactly like that

1788.799 --> 1791.84
you think that if some aspect would

1790.96 --> 1794.72
technically be

1791.84 --> 1795.36
missing and like it would be a duality

1794.72 --> 1798.64
let's just say

1795.36 --> 1801.6
roughly something else would it

1798.64 --> 1803.1200000000001
does that mean that the entire design of

1801.6 --> 1806.48
the realm will crumble

1803.12 --> 1809.6
because the entire creation is

1806.48 --> 1812.799
incomplete or doesn't work or

1809.6 --> 1814.7199999999998
see that's what it's really about it's

1812.799 --> 1819.279
about the design

1814.72 --> 1822.48
throughout all time so

1819.279 --> 1826.0
is does it matter

1822.48 --> 1826.0
really for the design

1832.399 --> 1836.8799999999999
i i think it's really just etheric

1834.559 --> 1841.12
philosophy and there's just

1836.88 --> 1844.0
a lot of extreme exoteric emphasis

1841.12 --> 1845.6789999999999
laid on these these divisions and these

1844.0 --> 1847.679
patterns

1845.679 --> 1850.64
and i don't really know why and yeah

1847.679 --> 1865.8400000000001
there's trinities everywhere

1850.64 --> 1865.8400000000001
it's a lot of trinities and religions

1876.84 --> 1884.1589999999999
anyway

1879.039 --> 1884.1589999999999
uh seeking star wars i wouldn't call it

1890.84 --> 1898.8799999999999
that

1893.12 --> 1898.8799999999999
i know it's all synchronized

1903.84 --> 1908.399
and i think by the way that the jesuits

1906.24 --> 1911.76
had something to do with that

1908.399 --> 1913.6
they probably synchronized

1911.76 --> 1915.679
most of the religions when they went

1913.6 --> 1916.6399999999999
around they ensured that the patterns

1915.679 --> 1920.88
would be

1916.64 --> 1923.039
matching so that the pattern correlation

1920.88 --> 1924.96
for an atheist for an outsider a

1923.039 --> 1928.24
non-local believer

1924.96 --> 1930.24
would be taken as absolute proof that

1928.24 --> 1931.84
the actual religious content is

1930.24 --> 1934.559
basically

1931.84 --> 1937.12
a waste of time and not real and that

1934.559 --> 1939.76
it's only about the patterns and

1937.12 --> 1940.8799999999999
if you draw astronomy into it or the

1939.76 --> 1942.64
astrology

1940.88 --> 1944.72
then it goes even further and just say

1942.64 --> 1947.679
oh it doesn't exist it's

1944.72 --> 1949.44
just about it's just about the skycock

1947.679 --> 1950.88
so yeah that's what they did

1949.44 --> 1952.48
that's why they went around that's why

1950.88 --> 1954.72
they synchronized it while they removed

1952.48 --> 1957.279
the deepest of wisdoms

1954.72 --> 1962.08
and the highest of priests and then

1957.279 --> 1965.84
synchronized the works

1962.08 --> 1965.84
basically rewrote everything

1968.279 --> 1974.08
re-engineered the story

1971.2 --> 1976.48
have the same figures probably but added

1974.08 --> 1979.36
on details changed

1976.48 --> 1980.08
timings added on stories all kinds of

1979.36 --> 1982.24
ways to

1980.08 --> 1983.36
ensure that there is absolute

1982.24 --> 1986.0
synchronicity

1983.36 --> 1987.279
in the system of the religion with all

1986.0 --> 1992.24
the other religions in

1987.279 --> 1992.24
some significant noticeable way

1996.799 --> 2001.2
but even before they did that it was

1999.519 --> 2003.44
probably already there

2001.2 --> 2005.1200000000001
there were probably already a lot of

2003.44 --> 2007.3600000000001
synchronicities

2005.12 --> 2007.36
you know

2009.84 --> 2017.1999999999998
ideas tend to spread and develop and

2014.24 --> 2018.08
yeah separately people do come up with

2017.2 --> 2021.519
similar

2018.08 --> 2025.9189999999999
things and similar responses and

2021.519 --> 2029.76
logical next steps that will be similar

2025.919 --> 2031.039
you know so even compartmentalize it's

2029.76 --> 2033.12
logical that they're

2031.039 --> 2035.2
that there should have been even before

2033.12 --> 2036.2399999999998
it was also artificially synchronized by

2035.2 --> 2038.799
the jesuits

2036.24 --> 2039.919
that even before that there were already

2038.799 --> 2042.08
a lot of

2039.919 --> 2044.0800000000002
synchronicities and just overlapping

2042.08 --> 2047.84
things

2044.08 --> 2047.84
should have always been there probably

2061.44 --> 2067.119
ah yeah roger i think that

2064.56 --> 2067.679
global's attacking the scientific method

2067.119 --> 2070.0
is

2067.679 --> 2074.0
just yeah it's desperation they're

2070.0 --> 2076.399
literally attacking their own

2074.0 --> 2078.48
their own primary artifact that they

2076.399 --> 2082.0789999999997
used to convince people

2078.48 --> 2084.879
that they were just in their

2082.079 --> 2086.0
yeah in their knowledge so there yeah

2084.879 --> 2087.919
they're just

2086.0 --> 2091.599
they're now trashing they're basically

2087.919 --> 2092.96
trashing their entire inventory

2091.599 --> 2094.96
that's what they're doing they're just

2092.96 --> 2096.7200000000003
taking everything that they've used

2094.96 --> 2100.48
before to win

2096.72 --> 2104.0
to be dwelling the masses

2100.48 --> 2106.4
to silence them passively

2104.0 --> 2108.16
that are now been yeah scrutinized and

2106.4 --> 2109.839
they're all taking it and they're just

2108.16 --> 2111.44
smashing it all against the walls it's

2109.839 --> 2114.48
all junk it's all junk

2111.44 --> 2117.839
nothing proves it but it's a ball

2114.48 --> 2117.839
that's what's happening

2119.2 --> 2127.359
anyway uh yeah gaining wisdom thanks

2122.64 --> 2127.359
glad you enjoyed my uh my visuals

2127.52 --> 2130.88
i thought that that presentation was

2129.52 --> 2134.64
very good very

2130.88 --> 2136.56
happy with it it is probably worth it to

2134.64 --> 2137.5989999999997
even just cut that part out and make it

2136.56 --> 2140.56
a separate video

2137.599 --> 2142.48
i might do that maybe up upload it on my

2140.56 --> 2145.839
arwinian bearer account or something i

2142.48 --> 2145.839
don't know

2151.89 --> 2155.179
[Music]

2162.48 --> 2165.92
now george sanford i'm pretty sure god

2165.04 --> 2169.359
with a big

2165.92 --> 2172.48
g does say things

2169.359 --> 2176.0789999999997
it's just that the problem is is that so

2172.48 --> 2176.079
many people just don't listen

2178.16 --> 2183.839
you know it's completely useless telling

2182.16 --> 2185.44
somebody else that you've literally

2183.839 --> 2188.48
heard god

2185.44 --> 2190.48
it's unacceptable the ego

2188.48 --> 2191.839
immediately counteracts that and just

2190.48 --> 2194.4
says no

2191.839 --> 2195.68
that's very easily explained away in

2194.4 --> 2198.32
another way

2195.68 --> 2200.0
doesn't mean it doesn't happen though

2198.32 --> 2203.04
it's just a natural consequence

2200.0 --> 2206.8
of having being in touch with the yeah

2203.04 --> 2206.8
with such intense

2207.76 --> 2215.599
shadow opposition conjuring forces

2212.72 --> 2217.2
that's what happens when the light is

2215.599 --> 2220.0
bright the shadows are

2217.2 --> 2220.0
very strong

2227.52 --> 2235.2
ah romer the evidence for this god

2231.04 --> 2235.2
well first off existence

2235.76 --> 2239.599
this everything we know and are and our

2239.04 --> 2242.64
thoughts

2239.599 --> 2246.6400000000003
themselves could not have existed

2242.64 --> 2247.44
could never be even attempted to be

2246.64 --> 2250.56
simulated

2247.44 --> 2252.48
without an original designer we can't

2250.56 --> 2254.839
emulate it you know why

2252.48 --> 2256.079
because when we do emulate forms of

2254.839 --> 2259.119
creation

2256.079 --> 2262.2400000000002
we take over the role

2259.119 --> 2265.92
of designer and therefore we are the

2262.24 --> 2268.24
designer as god is our designer

2265.92 --> 2271.839
that's how it works you can't get away

2268.24 --> 2271.839
from it it is physically impossible

2272.8 --> 2277.44
so yeah proof of god already there now

2275.599 --> 2278.4
the communication aspect that is

2277.44 --> 2280.7200000000003
something else

2278.4 --> 2283.76
that is much more supernatural in a

2280.72 --> 2285.359
sense and not just a natural consequence

2283.76 --> 2287.92
but i think that it is possible the

2285.359 --> 2290.96
problem is yeah will you be able to

2287.92 --> 2294.96
distinguish and

2290.96 --> 2297.28
does it signify only good

2294.96 --> 2298.96
for example those are the complicated

2297.28 --> 2300.8
things

2298.96 --> 2302.64
that is when it gets really complicated

2300.8 --> 2305.44
but it doesn't mean that it's

2302.64 --> 2305.92
not potentially possible that god from

2305.44 --> 2309.2000000000003
the

2305.92 --> 2310.4
highest dimension just reaches down into

2309.2 --> 2313.52
the fourth dimension

2310.4 --> 2317.04
takes you and just communicates

2313.52 --> 2318.8
says something like hey it's probably

2317.04 --> 2322.88
when they does that it's going to be

2318.8 --> 2322.88
directly involving your personal

2323.2 --> 2328.3999999999996
you as a person your soul like

2330.079 --> 2334.6400000000003
or maybe others that it might be a ch i

2332.8 --> 2336.4
don't know man how do you

2334.64 --> 2339.04
you put that down i think that god just

2336.4 --> 2342.4
does this cons continually it just

2339.04 --> 2343.7599999999998
you usually don't experience it as if

2342.4 --> 2346.32
communicating with

2343.76 --> 2348.1600000000003
an individual it's more like it's just

2346.32 --> 2349.44
being beamed into you and you're like

2348.16 --> 2352.839
okay i'm ready

2349.44 --> 2354.16
for the next phase what you got for me

2352.839 --> 2356.0
god

2354.16 --> 2359.5989999999997
that's kind of how it feels to me and

2356.0 --> 2361.359
even in a regular situation

2359.599 --> 2362.7200000000003
because yeah the information the ideas

2361.359 --> 2366.72
are coming from somewhere

2362.72 --> 2368.0
i'm not trying to

2366.72 --> 2370.16
yeah i think it's personally

2368.0 --> 2373.839
unreasonable even to say that

2370.16 --> 2376.72
ideas are made by your consciousness

2373.839 --> 2376.72
i don't think they are

2377.28 --> 2384.1600000000003
you know at best ideas are

2380.4 --> 2385.359
kept held on to by the consciousness but

2384.16 --> 2390.0789999999997
that doesn't mean that it

2385.359 --> 2392.0789999999997
literally fabricates it out of nothing

2390.079 --> 2395.599
where there was nothing before no it

2392.079 --> 2400.48
comes from somewhere it comes from

2395.599 --> 2402.2400000000002
the from the web of information that

2400.48 --> 2404.16
the oversight the time all the

2402.24 --> 2404.9599999999996
information there is throughout time and

2404.16 --> 2408.319
that is

2404.96 --> 2411.52
the creators as part of the design he

2408.319 --> 2415.52
is his mind

2411.52 --> 2419.44
through us is part of the design

2415.52 --> 2419.44
the word you could call it that yeah

2423.52 --> 2426.8
what are you doing good servant

2434.64 --> 2439.839
yeah that's the second time that

2436.079 --> 2439.8390000000004
happened now

2446.0 --> 2453.839
what is it

2462.24 --> 2467.839
what help do you need good servant

2471.839 --> 2476.4
okay well look unless you are literally

2474.48 --> 2477.04
planning to time somebody out because

2476.4 --> 2480.2400000000002
you see

2477.04 --> 2481.7599999999998
violated my policy then there's really

2480.24 --> 2484.0789999999997
no reason to even hang

2481.76 --> 2486.6400000000003
over with your pointer or mouse or

2484.079 --> 2489.92
whatever over where those dots are

2486.64 --> 2489.92
so be careful with that

2492.0 --> 2495.28
yeah you did you didn't do it that's

2494.16 --> 2499.2799999999997
fine it's

2495.28 --> 2509.8390000000004
just yeah try to be a little bit more

2499.28 --> 2509.8390000000004
careful about that

2517.28 --> 2523.8390000000004
what are you talking about romer

2520.48 --> 2523.839
what is this

2534.72 --> 2540.56
all right well dude uh being goofy

2538.079 --> 2542.319
is not an excuse either you take

2540.56 --> 2544.7999999999997
responsibility with the wrench

2542.319 --> 2546.079
or yeah if you continue to just mess up

2544.8 --> 2548.4
i will take it away

2546.079 --> 2550.2400000000002
not because punishing you but because

2548.4 --> 2553.119
apparently you keep

2550.24 --> 2554.0789999999997
throwing the thing all over the place so

2553.119 --> 2557.04
i don't know

2554.079 --> 2557.04
don't worry about it

2560.72 --> 2566.0
all right well yeah

2564.319 --> 2567.44
in that case i yeah i'm gonna take it

2566.0 --> 2569.28
away

2567.44 --> 2571.52
you don't think you can be responsible

2569.28 --> 2574.8
with it then it's just

2571.52 --> 2577.04
yeah that that's it you know i i'm not

2574.8 --> 2579.8390000000004
angry

2577.04 --> 2579.839
don't worry about that

2581.28 --> 2584.96
but yeah it's like the third time that's

2582.88 --> 2586.2400000000002
happened now and i know it's never meant

2584.96 --> 2593.839
nefarious but

2586.24 --> 2593.839
yeah it does get annoying

2593.92 --> 2607.839
yeah you wish hey jim

2613.76 --> 2617.76
okay all right i'll give you one more

2618.839 --> 2623.04
chance

2621.04 --> 2625.599
what's the topic today well the topic

2623.04 --> 2628.0
seems to be religion

2625.599 --> 2628.0
a bit

2629.119 --> 2636.88
[ __ ] a bit of movies

2634.24 --> 2639.04
uh yeah what definitely doesn't seem to

2636.88 --> 2640.8
be the topic is the title

2639.04 --> 2644.0
because yeah to be fair i don't really

2640.8 --> 2644.0
even want to talk about that

2644.079 --> 2647.8390000000004
it's more like i have just these things

2646.16 --> 2648.24
that i want to share with the world and

2647.839 --> 2650.319
then

2648.24 --> 2653.52
i'm like yeah i don't like the spirit of

2650.319 --> 2655.2
it but that is how i feel about it

2653.52 --> 2658.72
and i think it's probably a good

2655.2 --> 2658.72
personal judgment of mine

2660.8 --> 2667.119
yeah marxist combatants

2664.16 --> 2667.7599999999998
so yeah there's a big difference between

2667.119 --> 2670.6400000000003
just

2667.76 --> 2672.4
sjw school kids or moms that are just

2670.64 --> 2676.0789999999997
going along and just being yeah

2672.4 --> 2678.2400000000002
i want to be part

2676.079 --> 2681.28
that's a big difference between just

2678.24 --> 2682.56
really disgusting sociopaths that are

2681.28 --> 2685.2000000000003
among them as well

2682.56 --> 2686.4
that get tolerated because of the

2685.2 --> 2689.68
culture

2686.4 --> 2691.839
just overlooking their super anti-social

2689.68 --> 2695.2
and sickening behaviors

2691.839 --> 2698.64
and yeah and they hide the rest

2695.2 --> 2701.359
and these are what are going to be

2698.64 --> 2702.0789999999997
the combatants because they are there to

2701.359 --> 2706.16
literally

2702.079 --> 2709.28
destroy human civilization because they

2706.16 --> 2712.0789999999997
are not civilized and they want

2709.28 --> 2716.7200000000003
civilization destroyed

2712.079 --> 2716.7200000000003
that's what's in them they want it

2716.839 --> 2720.48
destroyed

2718.4 --> 2722.1600000000003
and yeah such people if you give them

2720.48 --> 2725.44
mercy the only thing

2722.16 --> 2728.0
the only thing it'll lead to

2725.44 --> 2733.839
is them eventually destroying more

2728.0 --> 2735.92
because you don't really get out of it

2733.839 --> 2737.599
you know if you've gone that deep that

2735.92 --> 2740.88
means you've already passed

2737.599 --> 2743.6800000000003
the suicidal threshold

2740.88 --> 2743.6800000000003
for most of them

2744.56 --> 2751.359
they've already done so much nasty [ __ ]

2747.68 --> 2752.72
that they can't even let it return

2751.359 --> 2755.2799999999997
they'll they'd just freaking kill

2752.72 --> 2757.2799999999997
themselves if they tried

2755.28 --> 2760.2400000000002
but that's with the really [ __ ] up bad

2757.28 --> 2764.96
ones those are the ones that do the

2760.24 --> 2769.2799999999997
sick assassination [ __ ] and all that

2764.96 --> 2772.48
monsters and the world doesn't need them

2769.28 --> 2775.8390000000004
we need to purge ourselves from them

2772.48 --> 2775.839
one way or the other

2775.92 --> 2782.2400000000002
and yeah you'd be sickeningly surprised

2778.88 --> 2782.2400000000002
how many of them are around

2783.76 --> 2790.2400000000002
like at this point having a literal

2787.119 --> 2791.599
actual plague and not a fake sickness

2790.24 --> 2794.0789999999997
supposedly

2791.599 --> 2795.2000000000003
would i would find that more preferable

2794.079 --> 2797.76
than having

2795.2 --> 2798.24
them as many as they are out there

2797.76 --> 2801.2000000000003
spread

2798.24 --> 2803.68
throughout the entire world they are

2801.2 --> 2806.7999999999997
much more dangerous on the long run

2803.68 --> 2806.7999999999997
and they will grow worse

2807.52 --> 2814.4
they will grow worse and they will draw

2810.0 --> 2814.4
in more people that will also become

2814.839 --> 2817.839
worse

2823.839 --> 2827.52
yeah yeah that's that's right

2827.64 --> 2836.7999999999997
orokimaru they will turn on each other

2831.68 --> 2836.7999999999997
but they will also destroy everything

2842.839 --> 2845.839
literally

2852.88 --> 2859.2000000000003
uh sensor lapse well you

2856.559 --> 2860.559
i don't know who you are exactly and i

2859.2 --> 2864.24
don't

2860.559 --> 2866.48
allow people to tell me how to manage my

2864.24 --> 2866.4799999999996
chat

2867.599 --> 2872.079
especially when it comes to people that

2870.24 --> 2873.9199999999996
i kind of trust and that i have more

2872.079 --> 2875.44
personal relationships with like good

2873.92 --> 2877.599
servants

2875.44 --> 2878.48
as an outsider that's not your place to

2877.599 --> 2882.079
talk about that

2878.48 --> 2882.079
and that's why i gave you a timeout

2883.359 --> 2890.679
that's all

2887.59 --> 2890.679
[Music]

2920.96 --> 2926.2400000000002
yeah romer yeah i do genocide yeah

2924.16 --> 2928.5589999999997
there's genocide in the bible

2926.24 --> 2930.64
guess what there's genocide in the world

2928.559 --> 2933.3590000000004
and there's going to be more genocide

2930.64 --> 2935.52
more of it you think that if you're just

2933.359 --> 2936.4
going to censor the concept away from

2935.52 --> 2939.359
everything and

2936.4 --> 2942.2400000000002
reject anything that has any kind of

2939.359 --> 2946.96
reference to genocide that it'll go away

2942.24 --> 2946.9599999999996
do you think that huh

2949.599 --> 2953.3590000000004
i don't think so so yeah genocide

2952.559 --> 2957.28
genocide

2953.359 --> 2960.48
genocide genocide genocide yeah

2957.28 --> 2960.48
it's in there that's right

2961.359 --> 2964.72
and there will be more genocide just so

2963.92 --> 2969.52
you know

2964.72 --> 2969.52
you know what's next there you go

2969.599 --> 2972.6400000000003
go escort now

2975.359 --> 2979.68
all right well well don't aspire to it

2978.4 --> 2983.04
then

2979.68 --> 2986.3999999999996
romer don't aspire to genocide

2983.04 --> 2990.24
because this [ __ ] accusation that

2986.4 --> 2993.52
by reading studying

2990.24 --> 2996.64
perhaps believing in the bible

2993.52 --> 3000.079
how is that aspiring to genocide you

2996.64 --> 3013.839
freaking blasphemous piece of [ __ ]

3000.079 --> 3013.8390000000004
[ __ ] off yeah you do

3030.16 --> 3034.16
right and you know what in this time

3033.04 --> 3036.319
period

3034.16 --> 3037.68
maybe there should be genocide maybe you

3036.319 --> 3041.7599999999998
should be on the list

3037.68 --> 3044.3999999999996
how about that huh huh

3041.76 --> 3044.4
you like it

3044.88 --> 3049.76
you wants it you want more what's next

3047.76 --> 3052.4
genocide is that what you want to squirt

3049.76 --> 3052.4
over all day

3052.839 --> 3055.839
aroma

3059.76 --> 3069.8390000000004
yeah really now [ __ ] off

3063.92 --> 3069.839
yeah what's next genocide you're it

3076.96 --> 3080.889
[Music]

3081.2 --> 3086.24
now unless you got maybe a point or

3084.079 --> 3088.96
something to communicate instead of just

3086.24 --> 3088.9599999999996
[ __ ]

3089.359 --> 3096.24
straw man accusations towards

3092.559 --> 3098.6400000000003
yeah foundations of what we do

3096.24 --> 3098.64
you know

3099.52 --> 3103.68
then yeah maybe we could have a

3102.16 --> 3105.52
conversation instead of just

3103.68 --> 3111.839
me banning you for being an absolute

3105.52 --> 3111.839
piece of [ __ ]

3114.24 --> 3118.4799999999996
oh you don't know what is you want to

3115.68 --> 3118.48
hear what he said

3118.96 --> 3122.64
surely that isn't something we should be

3121.119 --> 3126.079
aspiring to

3122.64 --> 3126.0789999999997
that was in response to

3126.48 --> 3130.0
the bible talks about destruction of

3128.64 --> 3133.359
entire peoples

3130.0 --> 3137.119
and yet you hold it in high regard

3133.359 --> 3141.04
yeah it talks about it

3137.119 --> 3144.079
so that means that if there is something

3141.04 --> 3146.079
written down somewhere you know

3144.079 --> 3147.92
about hey this happened wow it was

3146.079 --> 3150.4
genocide you know

3147.92 --> 3152.0
if it is written in something then that

3150.4 --> 3155.2000000000003
automatically means that

3152.0 --> 3157.119
if you read it you may think

3155.2 --> 3158.64
that it's actually i don't know

3157.119 --> 3161.599
historically valid or

3158.64 --> 3162.8799999999997
important somehow that automatically

3161.599 --> 3165.44
means

3162.88 --> 3166.079
that you aspire to genocide that you

3165.44 --> 3168.48
want to

3166.079 --> 3169.28
create the genocide that means that

3168.48 --> 3171.599
right that's

3169.28 --> 3173.8390000000004
total common sense right if there is any

3171.599 --> 3176.96
mention of genocide in anything

3173.839 --> 3177.44
and you don't immediately burn it that

3176.96 --> 3180.079
means

3177.44 --> 3180.48
you want to commit genocide pure logic

3180.079 --> 3184.88
there

3180.48 --> 3186.48
brilliant yeah that's why i ban people

3184.88 --> 3189.28
kick you into nuts too if you were

3186.48 --> 3189.28
physically here

3192.839 --> 3195.839
[ __ ]

3206.839 --> 3209.839
ugh

3212.64 --> 3215.92
yeah straw man

3216.0 --> 3222.48
and the thing about straw is it burns

3220.48 --> 3224.8
burns really well there's very little

3222.48 --> 3224.8
left

3226.0 --> 3229.159
[Applause]

3232.559 --> 3236.4
ah yeah that's interesting hana koala

3235.28 --> 3239.28
you know at least

3236.4 --> 3241.52
you at least you can make something

3239.28 --> 3244.7200000000003
creative out of it you know

3241.52 --> 3246.559
basically just got in a slapping match

3244.72 --> 3248.839
slapped him right back in the face and

3246.559 --> 3250.7200000000003
you actually make it into something that

3248.839 --> 3252.88
i

3250.72 --> 3255.04
yeah that that is an actual interesting

3252.88 --> 3257.04
philosophical matter

3255.04 --> 3258.16
it's really asking if god is a moral

3257.04 --> 3261.44
monster

3258.16 --> 3262.319
well think about it like this without

3261.44 --> 3264.16
god

3262.319 --> 3265.839
you wouldn't even [ __ ] know what

3264.16 --> 3270.48
morals are

3265.839 --> 3270.48
how about that huh

3271.2 --> 3274.319
how can you call something that

3273.52 --> 3278.48
literally

3274.319 --> 3282.319
even creates it

3278.48 --> 3283.76
how it makes yeah he creates it and he

3282.319 --> 3286.24
creates the opposite

3283.76 --> 3287.28
well guess what he still creates it so

3286.24 --> 3290.0789999999997
oh but you

3287.28 --> 3291.6800000000003
created the other side that means you're

3290.079 --> 3293.6800000000003
a monster

3291.68 --> 3295.1189999999997
oh really so how about i take it all

3293.68 --> 3298.24
away and then you got

3295.119 --> 3300.48
nothing how about that

3298.24 --> 3300.4799999999996
huh

3301.44 --> 3306.0
no people that think that are [ __ ]

3304.839 --> 3308.4
morons

3306.0 --> 3310.0
or just really young and naive because i

3308.4 --> 3314.319
i kind of had

3310.0 --> 3317.28
problems with that in ways i still do

3314.319 --> 3318.079
you know i just explained it yesterday

3317.28 --> 3322.7200000000003
yeah

3318.079 --> 3326.88
yeah true glory comes from agony

3322.72 --> 3330.64
personal confrontation and agony

3326.88 --> 3333.52
it does and anyway yeah thanks god

3330.64 --> 3334.4
but yeah however an unpleasant insight

3333.52 --> 3338.079
that might be

3334.4 --> 3341.119
for my ego to handle

3338.079 --> 3342.559
that doesn't mean that that it's all

3341.119 --> 3348.1600000000003
worthless or something no

3342.559 --> 3350.48
that's just how it works deal with it

3348.16 --> 3351.92
that i'm just gonna be pragmatic i'm not

3350.48 --> 3355.2
gonna be resentful what

3351.92 --> 3357.599
the hell does that lead to you know

3355.2 --> 3359.359
there's there are certain type of groups

3357.599 --> 3362.4
that have similarity

3359.359 --> 3365.04
they have similar trains of thought and

3362.4 --> 3366.0
yeah they kind of say like i so disagree

3365.04 --> 3367.92
about this

3366.0 --> 3371.599
i'm gonna do it the opposite way i'm

3367.92 --> 3373.76
gonna i'm gonna disprove that

3371.599 --> 3375.119
yeah you know where that leads to you

3373.76 --> 3379.6800000000003
know what they do

3375.119 --> 3382.88
what what happens these people

3379.68 --> 3386.72
hmm yeah they're called luciferians

3382.88 --> 3390.2400000000002
and satanists kind of different

3386.72 --> 3392.8799999999997
although yeah they overlap uh

3390.24 --> 3394.0789999999997
yeah how how does that work out for you

3392.88 --> 3396.48
huh

3394.079 --> 3397.76
does it work out for you you like those

3396.48 --> 3399.52
people

3397.76 --> 3401.119
you like what they do with the world you

3399.52 --> 3404.64
like that

3401.119 --> 3407.28
think they're great do you how much of

3404.64 --> 3409.68
the food you eat are grown by these

3407.28 --> 3409.6800000000003
people

3409.76 --> 3417.599
zero you say zero oh

3413.44 --> 3421.04
hmm why would that be

3417.599 --> 3424.0
right so yeah i'm just gonna

3421.04 --> 3424.48
shove that completely back into the tar

3424.0 --> 3428.0
pit

3424.48 --> 3432.48
where it belongs and i'm just gonna do

3428.0 --> 3435.44
things logically

3432.48 --> 3435.44
just common sense

3436.2 --> 3439.839
[Music]

3437.68 --> 3442.64
thing about discovering god is you have

3439.839 --> 3446.0
to learn a freaking deal with it

3442.64 --> 3449.68
yeah it hurts god

3446.0 --> 3453.359
hurts and it's good that it does

3449.68 --> 3456.319
because it's not just pain

3453.359 --> 3457.839
with no foresight with nothing only loss

3456.319 --> 3459.52
no that's not how it works that's not

3457.839 --> 3462.96
what god does

3459.52 --> 3464.64
that's satan does that's what ariman

3462.96 --> 3467.04
does

3464.64 --> 3468.64
and that's where lucifer eventually goes

3467.04 --> 3472.5589999999997
i'm variance

3468.64 --> 3473.68
now god does hurt but you get something

3472.559 --> 3477.119
back and it makes you

3473.68 --> 3478.98
more so it's just

3477.119 --> 3482.139
a misunderstood gift

3478.98 --> 3482.139
[Music]

3483.92 --> 3489.839
the punishment is the gift

3501.76 --> 3508.079
all right it's god's punishment it's not

3505.599 --> 3509.6800000000003
a punishment for any man to take on

3508.079 --> 3513.8390000000004
themselves

3509.68 --> 3516.64
to think that they represent god

3513.839 --> 3517.2799999999997
do it for him that's not how it works no

3516.64 --> 3520.72
it's

3517.28 --> 3524.7200000000003
it it's only here it's inside

3520.72 --> 3524.72
that's where god punishes you

3525.2 --> 3528.839
unless you completely disconnect and

3526.96 --> 3531.839
then he starts to punish you on the

3528.839 --> 3531.839
outside

3533.52 --> 3537.28
and you can pretend the rest of your

3535.599 --> 3538.1600000000003
life like you're not being punished by

3537.28 --> 3545.8390000000004
god

3538.16 --> 3545.839
and you'll just blame something else

3553.839 --> 3559.839
i don't know guns have never owned yeah

3556.559 --> 3559.8390000000004
i don't care

3561.68 --> 3565.359
well i do care it's just that

3568.72 --> 3574.72
yeah no you gotta

3572.72 --> 3576.799
look with luciferians especially you

3574.72 --> 3579.68
gotta realize it's not really the same

3576.799 --> 3582.799
as just pure satanism

3579.68 --> 3584.16
it's just more deviant and gay and just

3582.799 --> 3587.28
like you know we're gonna do it

3584.16 --> 3592.8799999999997
different bible contrarians

3587.28 --> 3592.88
in a way and it's really disgusting

3592.96 --> 3596.7200000000003
but it's that is different

3598.72 --> 3604.16
but yeah they do

3601.839 --> 3607.04
hang around with dark situations and

3604.16 --> 3609.2
they do give into that a lot of them

3607.04 --> 3610.88
it's yeah you could almost say that

3609.2 --> 3612.72
depends on the individual and there

3610.88 --> 3616.0
might be even

3612.72 --> 3619.839
i don't know okay luciferians and

3616.0 --> 3619.839
really [ __ ] up luciferians

3621.599 --> 3631.949
all right

3628.75 --> 3631.949
[Music]

3632.48 --> 3638.96
but uh yeah i'd i'd prefer to just get

3636.319 --> 3642.0
to know some more christians

3638.96 --> 3645.2
and christians that actually look

3642.0 --> 3650.559
in people's eyes how about that

3645.2 --> 3650.5589999999997
no okay i'm also so sick just of

3651.92 --> 3657.52
bible people that are just

3655.04 --> 3658.799
making a bible doll of themselves and

3657.52 --> 3660.72
then think that it's all

3658.799 --> 3663.119
oh yo they're all saved and they can do

3660.72 --> 3664.0
whatever the [ __ ] nasty behavior or just

3663.119 --> 3667.76
manipulation

3664.0 --> 3671.44
[ __ ] they like no no a real christian

3667.76 --> 3673.6800000000003
looks a stranger in the eye

3671.44 --> 3674.64
and you they can if they're really a

3673.68 --> 3677.2799999999997
real christian

3674.64 --> 3679.04
if they have pure purified if they've

3677.28 --> 3683.119
opened up their soul and

3679.04 --> 3685.839
show the truth and the real self

3683.119 --> 3686.48
they look you in the eye so it's almost

3685.839 --> 3688.88
like i can

3686.48 --> 3691.44
recognize a real christian even though i

3688.88 --> 3695.359
don't even speak a word to them now

3691.44 --> 3698.2400000000002
also they do tend to be surrounded by

3695.359 --> 3700.319
wife and children it does help to

3698.24 --> 3704.24
recognize

3700.319 --> 3704.24
and then i always feel like ah [ __ ]

3708.4 --> 3713.839
i wish i kinda had that

3725.119 --> 3730.799
