187.62 --> 200.66
yeah I think I got you all obeyed sixty

190.23 --> 200.66
RMC yeah good to see you all so yeah

202.659 --> 215.599
hmm I hope you guys are all doing okay I

212.769 --> 219.59
seem to be a code doing okay right now

215.599 --> 223.25
but yeah I'm I'm going through a bit of

219.59 --> 225.909
a rough patch it was kind of like

223.25 --> 229.569
yesterday and yeah it persisted

225.909 --> 234.2
unfortunately it was weird I went to bed

229.569 --> 240.56
exceptionally early was it I think like

234.2 --> 245.17999999999998
around 1 o'clock and yeah when I woke up

240.56 --> 250.219
I did not feel good so but I had a good

245.18 --> 256.669
long talk with my dad and worked some

250.219 --> 264.68
things out so yeah I guess I'm fine just

256.669 --> 271.00899999999996
I went over my peak that's what I think

264.68 --> 274.27
is it just like last year I I start to

271.009 --> 276.8
get caught up in looking very deeply and

274.27 --> 280.669
then I looked too deeply and then I

276.8 --> 283.55
can't unlock and that stresses me out to

280.669 --> 287.38
no end and it also makes me obsess over

283.55 --> 290.24
that instead of actually fixing

287.38 --> 296.74
situations that bring me stress in my

290.24 --> 296.74
personal life it's complicated

303.69 --> 308.82
but yeah I'll get out of it again it's

306.24 --> 313.17
yeah my dad and me figure it out pretty

308.82 --> 315.21
much comparing it to my youth situations

313.17 --> 318.75
because my dad does that also my met dad

315.21 --> 321.06
remembers how I was raised and all that

318.75 --> 324.24
it was weird because in he had his own

321.06 --> 326.55
preoccupied problems a lot but it seems

324.24 --> 328.44
that he didn't really pay attention and

326.55 --> 331.23
it's funny because now that he's learned

328.44 --> 333.87
so much it is awakened in his own way he

331.23 --> 337.14000000000004
gets and understands so much more of

333.87 --> 339.63
everything that he experienced well yeah

337.14 --> 339.99
when we were all younger and it's really

339.63 --> 342.36
good

339.99 --> 344.49
and he basically reminded me like yeah

342.36 --> 350.58000000000004
you seem to be overloading with energy

344.49 --> 353.13
and you can you can't basically let it

350.58 --> 355.59
go or find a good place for it and

353.13 --> 362.61
that's also because well in my practical

355.59 --> 365.03999999999996
life it's yeah I don't I don't give

362.61 --> 367.47
myself a lot of maneuvering room

365.04 --> 371.04
I don't naturally try out a lot of new

367.47 --> 371.88000000000005
things yes blatantly obvious been kind

371.04 --> 373.83000000000004
of open about it

371.88 --> 377.7
but that gives problems as well because

373.83 --> 382.95
then times I will feel very imprisoned

377.7 --> 387.169
by my own life by how I live and I blame

382.95 --> 387.169
myself for the choices

391.06 --> 398.54
[Music]

392.2 --> 401.63
but yeah I need to try to find a way to

398.54 --> 406.93
anchor myself again in where I am now

401.63 --> 411.32
and proceed to find a sensible way

406.93 --> 414.2
through and not not despair just I

411.32 --> 416.42
really need to gather the tools that

414.2 --> 418.58
I've built and then find the sensible

416.42 --> 422.29
new weight as it were

418.58 --> 422.28999999999996
doesn't have to be radical but

427.5 --> 434.82
but this is all me my personal life so

430.35 --> 442.32000000000005
don't don't think this is anything to do

434.82 --> 450.45
with everybody else out there get indeed

442.32 --> 452.79
a sock and the obvious but yeah I'm a

450.45 --> 456.3
bit preoccupied with that it's annoying

452.79 --> 457.77000000000004
it's again me talking about freaking me

456.3 --> 460.08
I

457.77 --> 462.33
I'm personally getting sick of it really

460.08 --> 464.15999999999997
like you've released is my show now just

462.33 --> 468.83
me talking about me and my struggles

464.16 --> 471.63000000000005
really it should be about flatter asses

468.83 --> 473.72999999999996
but yeah then again the fighters debate

471.63 --> 483.53
you know I'll still be going right after

473.73 --> 483.53000000000003
this to that so and yeah I do that there

484.23 --> 490.40000000000003
but

485.88 --> 490.4
teach myself to knit or Crockett

493.759 --> 501.319
it's so funny I don't think it's me

497.229 --> 503.62899999999996
but weirdly enough at the rule of

501.319 --> 508.639
Steiner type school I did actually learn

503.629 --> 509.059
how to do that I made my own my own what

508.639 --> 512.75
is it

509.059 --> 515.899
knitted slippers kind of thing it was it

512.75 --> 521.68
was silly and fun and they were pretty

515.899 --> 524.269
good but it's just not really me know

521.68 --> 528.8599999999999
yet they teach you that even the boys

524.269 --> 531.44
they teach you how to knit and stuff and

528.86 --> 536.32
it was a very learn fall experience for

531.44 --> 536.32
me and meditative indeed

539.3 --> 546.63
but yeah it's not not really my thing

542.7 --> 548.76
you know that's something I would start

546.63 --> 553.47
doing just on my own volition so weird

548.76 --> 555.18
it's it's just that my thing look if I'm

553.47 --> 561.75
gonna build things then it's probably

555.18 --> 564.03
I'm gonna build a game maps that is more

561.75 --> 566.49
the thing that I do when it comes to

564.03 --> 568.89
constructing an a it does reap rewards

566.49 --> 571.83
the problem is only yeah there's so much

568.89 --> 574.71
I can make but there's very little room

571.83 --> 577.44
to actually be able to apply it all I

574.71 --> 580.8000000000001
still have in my dungeon dragons game

577.44 --> 582.8100000000001
master map I still have well it's called

580.8 --> 584.9699999999999
dungeons it's not literally it's just a

582.81 --> 587.1899999999999
location that the players can go into as

584.97 --> 589.11
an encounter and then be challenged and

587.19 --> 592.11
all that figure out things and find the

589.11 --> 597.66
treasure blah but there's like things I

592.11 --> 600.84
made four years ago that still have not

597.66 --> 602.91
come to pass and that well the way

600.84 --> 604.74
things have grown they will never come

602.91 --> 607.04
to pass because their challenge level

604.74 --> 612.3
was just all built on a much lower level

607.04 --> 616.5799999999999
so it'll be yeah it'll be way too easy

612.3 --> 619.29
for them now but that happens a lot

616.58 --> 621.21
that's a game ah so you got an idea I

619.29 --> 623.75
like oh they could go here and you build

621.21 --> 626.73
it and then they go do something else

623.75 --> 629.43
then you can either try to adapt your

626.73 --> 633.84
creation to another place where they

629.43 --> 636.15
will bump into and/or try to save it for

633.84 --> 639.33
later and who knows what'll happen what

636.15 --> 642.3299999999999
I now tend to do is like okay this map

639.33 --> 645.089
situation that I made for so long ago is

642.33 --> 648.45
completely superfluous but officially it

645.089 --> 651.69
kind of exists so what can transpire in

648.45 --> 655.589
the meantime with it all to kind of

651.69 --> 658.71
evolve the map because I did spawn it

655.589 --> 661.11
after all and then there were like a

658.71 --> 663.9000000000001
species involved in those locations

661.11 --> 665.97
specifically that it's their home so how

663.9 --> 667.569
will they evolve as the entire world has

665.97 --> 670.72
changed around it

667.569 --> 677.8689999999999
during the course of the entire playtime

670.72 --> 680.839
anyway for me it's I like doing that

677.869 --> 682.1890000000001
it's not that hard to do really oh wait

680.839 --> 691.629
you might not have been talking about

682.189 --> 691.629
that talking about fishing I guess

697.05 --> 701.8399999999999
painting

699.33 --> 705.76
right

701.84 --> 711.35
well in a way I'd like to sketch

705.76 --> 715.91
locations so you know with me drawing

711.35 --> 717.86
things like yeah figures living beings

715.91 --> 722.54
has always been very difficult for me

717.86 --> 725.27
but geometrics and like buildings and

722.54 --> 726.98
and forms that has always been much

725.27 --> 728.75
easier to me I had a lot of practice for

726.98 --> 731.9
that so sometimes I do kind of like make

728.75 --> 733.82
a drawing of like yeah you're walking in

731.9 --> 736.31
this room and then you have the top down

733.82 --> 737.9000000000001
map show no this is the room space this

736.31 --> 740.7199999999999
year and here are the walls and then I

737.9 --> 742.22
have a drawing like this is exactly what

740.72 --> 744.98
you're looking at when you're standing

742.22 --> 750.08
here on the map looking there so I get

744.98 --> 754.1
fill in a more 3d view roughly to give

750.08 --> 756.1700000000001
extra depth to the virtual creation and

754.1 --> 758.029
it works really well when I get it when

756.17 --> 760.91
I have that inspiration because most of

758.029 --> 762.86
the time I don't even have that it's it

760.91 --> 766.25
just remains a rough layout and I'm too

762.86 --> 768.26
distracted by the for example hostile

766.25 --> 770.48
characters and how they're planning to

768.26 --> 774.86
go against the enemy I don't have time

770.48 --> 781.16
for for visual design details of the

774.86 --> 786.98
locations that I make them anyway game

781.16 --> 791.38
mastering industrial sewing machine for

786.98 --> 791.38
leather ooh that's tough one

795.14 --> 798.6999999999999
can be very handy though

805.81 --> 810.43
Tyler Mac I don't think anyone really

808.04 --> 810.43
cares

819.54 --> 822.17
hmm

829.5 --> 839.37
I don't want to know Tom Parker its look

834.83 --> 844.38
what else can I contribute what else can

839.37 --> 846.84
i contribute it's like even the doubts

844.38 --> 851.73
about the coronavirus how many layers

846.84 --> 857.57
are out there now it's I did not expect

851.73 --> 863.16
this I did not expect this at all I

857.57 --> 865.9200000000001
thought it was gonna be covered lit like

863.16 --> 869.67
the lid strictly on top no matter the

865.92 --> 872.5699999999999
conspiracy suggestions but it seems like

869.67 --> 875.0699999999999
more people have picked up on this and

872.57 --> 877.5
yeah one of the most astounding things

875.07 --> 881.0100000000001
that I read now of course it is still

877.5 --> 883.14
basically a political expression so

881.01 --> 888.63
maybe a little complex but there was

883.14 --> 891.66
this Indian official I got this from RT

888.63 --> 894.06
an Indian official said that well

891.66 --> 897.3
basically my story that the fluid is

894.06 --> 899.6999999999999
just caused by the weather and it's

897.3 --> 904.4699999999999
really not that dangerous it is being

899.7 --> 907.5300000000001
hyped and used as some kind of virtual

904.47 --> 910.14
tool to manipulate markets now that that

907.53 --> 912.9
are naturally in any restlessness

910.14 --> 915.09
because of the the general fear that

912.9 --> 918.15
comes from the idea of a virus spreading

915.09 --> 921.0600000000001
and all that so complicated become so

918.15 --> 927.16
complicated these are one just one of

921.06 --> 931.4599999999999
the things that I just worry about its

927.16 --> 937.16
and I can bet you there is gonna be a

931.46 --> 941.33
lot done with it unfortunately one way

937.16 --> 945.14
or the other it's not a it's not a

941.33 --> 950.4100000000001
superficial little thing although still

945.14 --> 954.56
yet the actual virus to me seems not

950.41 --> 961.87
what is suggested through media that it

954.56 --> 961.8699999999999
is but there yeah there is something

974.93 --> 983.3889999999999
well I look in the article I think I

980.209 --> 987.199
posted yeah I did post that it even says

983.389 --> 991.399
that their regular flu is actually more

987.199 --> 996.16
deadly than this version of the virus

991.399 --> 996.16
that is suggested deaths yeah

1012.709 --> 1018.529
yes yes mark alert you got that totally

1015.559 --> 1022.129
right yeah there are parties out there

1018.529 --> 1023.99
and I think it's pretty understood by a

1022.129 --> 1027.23
lot of people that China is one of those

1023.99 --> 1028.8990000000001
parties that had severe banking problems

1027.23 --> 1032.809
where they basically had too much debt

1028.899 --> 1037.579
no way to pay it back and they basically

1032.809 --> 1039.74
could not pay out everyone that has

1037.579 --> 1042.26
worked for them what they promised so

1039.74 --> 1044.779
then they make it crash through the

1042.26 --> 1047.089
virus and then afterward they say and

1044.779 --> 1048.47
what is it but what about our money and

1047.089 --> 1050.24
what about our money you promise it's

1048.47 --> 1054.919
like yes sir we can do it we crashed

1050.24 --> 1057.83
because of the virus and they'll sound a

1054.919 --> 1059.8700000000001
lot better to people then yeah sorry we

1057.83 --> 1061.309
crash because we basically promised you

1059.87 --> 1064.07
[ __ ] we didn't give you and you went

1061.309 --> 1072.37
with it that's not gonna lie as well so

1064.07 --> 1076.33
I guess by that measuring stick

1072.37 --> 1076.33
it does seem sensible

1078.47 --> 1084.799
for them at least to use it whether they

1081.259 --> 1087.1390000000001
actually created it responded or or this

1084.799 --> 1089.75
that they were the ones to decide that

1087.139 --> 1093.769
this is going to be a thing I don't know

1089.75 --> 1099.519
that but they can definitely benefit

1093.769 --> 1099.519
from it in the aftermath and they will

1099.789 --> 1105.799
and now it's up to every other country

1103.19 --> 1108.409
what they are gonna do because yeah

1105.799 --> 1111.519
China's really not the only one in you

1108.409 --> 1111.519
know financial trouble here

1121.37 --> 1129.55
I can't rob a bank with a kleenex dick

1127.309 --> 1129.55
yes

1138.59 --> 1142.36
right Tom Parker yeah that's right

1161.7 --> 1167.289
yeah I know I get the job good surf and

1165.009 --> 1170.289
it's just that I'm I'm not really in all

1167.289 --> 1175.269
that much of a giggly mood about these

1170.289 --> 1176.669
things if you know what I mean but I get

1175.269 --> 1184.21
it

1176.669 --> 1186.6290000000001
and the spells pretty strong but let's

1184.21 --> 1192.0900000000001
not hand out any ideas here people

1186.629 --> 1197.08
serious understand the responsibility of

1192.09 --> 1201.4499999999998
understanding itself please some things

1197.08 --> 1204.1899999999998
you may think are jokes it bad people

1201.45 --> 1207.7
potentially can pick up on it and use it

1204.19 --> 1211.1390000000001
it's not a joke it's really really not a

1207.7 --> 1213.669
joke that's why you got to be careful

1211.139 --> 1216.9699999999998
with your consciousness when you see

1213.669 --> 1218.919
things be careful what you say when you

1216.97 --> 1222.82
see more you will start to realize that

1218.919 --> 1226.8700000000001
all your words may have echoes that

1222.82 --> 1229.1689999999999
cause things so be careful even with

1226.87 --> 1229.1689999999999
jokes

1230.12 --> 1253.4699999999998
[Music]

1231.73 --> 1253.47
right just the general advice the c-word

1260.51 --> 1269.3799999999999
well girls which Bella it only manifests

1263.78 --> 1274.49
if you attribute real danger to it I

1269.38 --> 1276.7990000000002
don't think that saying Corona is in

1274.49 --> 1280.34
itself feeding into the spell it is just

1276.799 --> 1282.5
when you give it the the spell power the

1280.34 --> 1285.22
illusion of the spell power that's been

1282.5 --> 1289.37
put behind it

1285.22 --> 1292.52
that's not good and it's not good to say

1289.37 --> 1293.84
like just to talk about it all day even

1292.52 --> 1301.929
if you're saying it's not real it's not

1293.84 --> 1301.9289999999999
real no that doesn't help either a tank

1304.24 --> 1311.44
never leaving your home again

1306.62 --> 1311.4399999999998
it seems like a long stretch but okay

1327.68 --> 1335.48
I see it basic CRM see that's a one

1331.28 --> 1337.43
aspect do you understand one aspect the

1335.48 --> 1341.93
amount of things that can roll out of

1337.43 --> 1344.8400000000001
this is pretty fast also concerning

1341.93 --> 1348.5
long-term planning because of the

1344.84 --> 1350.99
consequence of the virus is kind of the

1348.5 --> 1352.67
effect is pretty much set in its ways I

1350.99 --> 1354.92
think I think that the people that

1352.67 --> 1356.63
really understand the situation that are

1354.92 --> 1359.3600000000001
kind of planners they know what this

1356.63 --> 1361.6100000000001
will do and therefore it kind of makes

1359.36 --> 1366.3999999999999
things more predictable for the near

1361.61 --> 1366.3999999999999
future in order to plan ahead deeply

1369.07 --> 1377.24
because in a way it is a cover so I

1374.51 --> 1379.69
explained like the first times I started

1377.24 --> 1382.55
talking about it it's a good cover

1379.69 --> 1386.48
because if everybody's preoccupied with

1382.55 --> 1390.01
fear of this they will overlook things

1386.48 --> 1392.27
that they normally would not allow

1390.01 --> 1395.8
government for example or whatever

1392.27 --> 1395.8
people involved to do

1403.019 --> 1409.509
sure basic CRM see well the big guys are

1406.779 --> 1411.19
the big guys are basically the guys that

1409.509 --> 1415.8890000000001
are in the know that are setting the

1411.19 --> 1418.029
plans and yeah they know they know they

1415.889 --> 1421.99
wouldn't say everything but they know

1418.029 --> 1427.749
pretty much as good as everything and I

1421.99 --> 1430.659
don't know if if they even allow

1427.749 --> 1434.289
themselves more than to just be a common

1430.659 --> 1437.2
executing conduit for that plan I don't

1434.289 --> 1440.049
even know if they have any more

1437.2 --> 1444.309
influence like that I don't know who

1440.049 --> 1446.08
designs the orders don't know it's

1444.309 --> 1449.94
probably not even a single individuals

1446.08 --> 1449.9399999999998
probably just think tanks

1479.57 --> 1485.96
oh you're only always on the bottom if

1483.259 --> 1488.57
you choose to Tom Parker you can sit

1485.96 --> 1492.47
anywhere it's just what's the best place

1488.57 --> 1501.019
for you because every position has an

1492.47 --> 1507.229
advantage and a disadvantage it's like

1501.019 --> 1510.739
what type of freedom do you want you

1507.229 --> 1514.3890000000001
want freedom of the mind you want

1510.739 --> 1514.3890000000001
freedom for the body

1528.31 --> 1532.259
and yes

1529.2 --> 1532.259
[Music]

1532.76 --> 1542.75
yeah well don't Parker you're free to

1535.549 --> 1547.46
believe that you're free and in many

1542.75 --> 1551.39
ways I trust that you are you just don't

1547.46 --> 1553.52
really realize how you're not too much

1551.39 --> 1556.13
and you either or either fine with that

1553.52 --> 1560.6
or you simply don't have the oversight

1556.13 --> 1562.8500000000001
and therefore it's pretty bliss if you

1560.6 --> 1566.299
truly believe you are truly free then in

1562.85 --> 1576.77
a way you are and it's kind of bliss but

1566.299 --> 1579.25
no one is really ever free no one gets

1576.77 --> 1579.25
the same

1607.29 --> 1612.69
[Music]

1609.389 --> 1616.109
all right so 101 rock on I'll just put

1612.69 --> 1618.8990000000001
you in theory in front of you sort of so

1616.109 --> 1621.6899999999998
you want all of the freedom right so

1618.899 --> 1623.849
what will you do once you have it how

1621.69 --> 1627.719
long will it take before you use this

1623.849 --> 1629.729
freedom to imprison yourself with a

1627.719 --> 1632.729
prison of your own creation that you

1629.729 --> 1642.409
want without realizing that it also

1632.729 --> 1645.719
takes away freedom see absolute freedom

1642.409 --> 1654.3290000000002
that is like that cannot be restricted

1645.719 --> 1656.309
by yourself is void only real freedom is

1654.329 --> 1660.6589999999999
basically the freedom to choose how you

1656.309 --> 1674.47
will be in prison sounds really dark

1660.659 --> 1677.67
like that it's don't take it personal

1674.47 --> 1677.67
[Music]

1692.0 --> 1695.13
[Music]

1695.73 --> 1702.809
right yeah and then I look at myself and

1698.82 --> 1706.74
I realize I'm looking at myself and I

1702.809 --> 1711.539
see dude you made some really really

1706.74 --> 1713.789
shitty choices but looking at the

1711.539 --> 1718.08
situation and who I am understanding

1713.789 --> 1722.19
that better I can't fathom a way I could

1718.08 --> 1726.539
have gotten out of that without losing

1722.19 --> 1729.21
more if I had made other choices I would

1726.539 --> 1733.529
literally not be recognizable or

1729.21 --> 1736.74
comparable to what I am now would have

1733.529 --> 1738.62
not come to that now is that a good

1736.74 --> 1748.01
thing or a bad thing I'll never know

1738.62 --> 1751.139
literally I will never know in the end

1748.01 --> 1757.919
but God knows that every step of the way

1751.139 --> 1759.6899999999998
I'm I am kind of desperate did the

1757.919 --> 1763.789
follow his path he knew that he knew

1759.69 --> 1763.789
that from when I was born even

1769.49 --> 1776.65
anyway we're stupid I don't want to talk

1773.21 --> 1776.65
about me hmm

1778.75 --> 1783.83
the globe ratio between like and dislike

1781.37 --> 1786.02
yeah yeah see there's more people out

1783.83 --> 1787.97
there that just really don't like me are

1786.02 --> 1794.72
when talking about really deep things

1787.97 --> 1796.8500000000001
and kind of me sharing my experiences in

1794.72 --> 1799.91
a way with depression I guess

1796.85 --> 1802.76
technically it is a limited form of

1799.91 --> 1805.67
depression what I going on there it's

1802.76 --> 1807.98
not yeah it's not chronic in a sense

1805.67 --> 1809.99
it's constant but like the pressure goes

1807.98 --> 1812.0
up in a certain period in the winter and

1809.99 --> 1814.36
then it becomes too much and then I

1812.0 --> 1817.34
experience depression because of it

1814.36 --> 1820.01
too much it collapses that's basically

1817.34 --> 1822.4399999999998
what it is and I bet there's a lot of

1820.01 --> 1825.77
glow bars out there a lot of them right

1822.44 --> 1830.27
now that don't really want to know about

1825.77 --> 1834.3799999999999
that that don't want to feel the reality

1830.27 --> 1837.26
of the looming depression that's kind of

1834.38 --> 1840.65
creeping up to all of them with the

1837.26 --> 1847.67
coming of the Black Swan it was coming

1840.65 --> 1850.91
way earlier than that because I always

1847.67 --> 1853.76
notice just how the lack of general

1850.91 --> 1856.96
Globus even talking in my chat when I

1853.76 --> 1860.33
start to bring up this type of subject

1856.96 --> 1861.74
they don't pop in here it's only really

1860.33 --> 1863.27
when I start to talk about technical

1861.74 --> 1864.77
issues that they certainly get in here

1863.27 --> 1867.44
and start to challenge me with their

1864.77 --> 1870.41
machinations and all that they pretty

1867.44 --> 1872.15
much stay clear when I give a sign that

1870.41 --> 1873.6200000000001
I'm not really feeling good and that I'm

1872.15 --> 1876.02
probably going to be talking about that

1873.62 --> 1878.84
for a while I've really paid attention

1876.02 --> 1881.87
to that I've noticed it and now some of

1878.84 --> 1884.1499999999999
the ballers they might hang around to be

1881.87 --> 1884.75
like oh just don't do anything you all

1884.15 --> 1887.1100000000001
regret

1884.75 --> 1889.58
they'll gift like this over generalized

1887.11 --> 1892.2199999999998
what do you say against the depressed

1889.58 --> 1896.78
person advice and that's it they don't

1892.22 --> 1899.8700000000001
really look they probably shouldn't for

1896.78 --> 1902.3899999999999
the reasons I mentioned before but I do

1899.87 --> 1903.08
always notice that it's really the flat

1902.39 --> 1908.75
earthers

1903.08 --> 1911.96
that that are really stepping up towards

1908.75 --> 1913.97
me also to really think with me or try

1911.96 --> 1917.21
to some extent to see if they can help

1913.97 --> 1921.13
me fix something and I really appreciate

1917.21 --> 1925.21
that but I don't see ballers do that

1921.13 --> 1925.21
they don't even do it with their own

1931.02 --> 1940.91
with their own narrow their room damn

1938.25 --> 1940.91
ballers

1942.99 --> 1946.049
[Music]

1950.08 --> 1953.339
[Music]

1956.87 --> 1965.6299999999999
ah I always do feel better like after

1962.36 --> 1969.08
I've done a show though it's a good way

1965.63 --> 1973.0100000000002
for me to to express things and a good

1969.08 --> 1982.6399999999999
phone call to I do stuff play music or

1973.01 --> 1987.41
write anything I study a lot including

1982.64 --> 1989.48
music and I do edit it a little here and

1987.41 --> 1992.66
there because I'm big fan of music but

1989.48 --> 1995.39
even when I feel like this it's like

1992.66 --> 1997.97
it's not like everything you do no it's

1995.39 --> 2000.2800000000002
just I'm oversensitive and the littlest

1997.97 --> 2002.38
of thing can just crush me that's more

2000.28 --> 2005.23
what it's like for me that's the type of

2002.38 --> 2007.96
the fact that I have from it and I am

2005.23 --> 2010.09
aware of it and I get defenses so don't

2007.96 --> 2011.92
think you can pull something on me when

2010.09 --> 2014.47
I'm in this state because I'm very

2011.92 --> 2017.53
defended but it still have to deal with

2014.47 --> 2024.13
it because I can't fully fix it or at

2017.53 --> 2026.7
least it seems like that now I lost the

2024.13 --> 2026.7
train of thought

2038.64 --> 2043.38
yes that's a good one 101 rockhound a

2042.299 --> 2045.21
good way to experience what you talk

2043.38 --> 2048.06
about is spending in the time alone in

2045.21 --> 2051.6
the wilderness yes well that is absolute

2048.06 --> 2053.609
freedom and it is absolute risk so that

2051.6 --> 2056.0699999999997
is that is kind of the essence of

2053.609 --> 2058.71
freedom their real essence and but can

2056.07 --> 2062.06
you grasp the consequences

2058.71 --> 2065.659
intellectually because real freedom is

2062.06 --> 2068.639
absolute risk that's the real freedom

2065.659 --> 2071.58
because you can technically find freedom

2068.639 --> 2073.619
in anything you could find freedom

2071.58 --> 2075.929
against the law say you know what screw

2073.619 --> 2079.1690000000003
this law I'm openly gonna say I don't

2075.929 --> 2081.03
agree I'm not gonna do it but then you

2079.169 --> 2081.8399999999997
may potentially have to face the

2081.03 --> 2085.32
consequences

2081.84 --> 2086.73
so that is freedom that is absolute

2085.32 --> 2091.46
freedom you really do have the choice

2086.73 --> 2091.46
but can you take the risk

2097.25 --> 2104.89
oh hi Anson thanks for subscribing to my

2100.52 --> 2104.89
channel I hope you enjoy it

2108.47 --> 2117.3799999999997
no I'm not gonna do that show you and

2111.619 --> 2121.04
Kat not at all now there's really

2117.38 --> 2122.2400000000002
nothing that works I've tried a lot a

2121.04 --> 2125.9
lot

2122.24 --> 2126.3489999999997
well not antidepressants I have actually

2125.9 --> 2127.9700000000003
tried

2126.349 --> 2134.4500000000003
what is it the natural antidepressant

2127.97 --> 2138.7
this is it say st. John's worth it did

2134.45 --> 2140.4199999999996
something but again it's even the

2138.7 --> 2143.66
antidepressant drugs what they

2140.42 --> 2146.78
technically do is kind of force set you

2143.66 --> 2150.23
into this certain type of mood that is

2146.78 --> 2153.44
less enjoyable than going through the

2150.23 --> 2156.619
crush of the depression feelings but

2153.44 --> 2157.369
yeah that doesn't really solve the

2156.619 --> 2161.0
problem

2157.369 --> 2163.01
it literally postpones my problem the

2161.0 --> 2165.05
problem that causes the situation it is

2163.01 --> 2167.2700000000004
really to me it's like a spiritual

2165.05 --> 2169.79
metabolism that's why I say it cycles it

2167.27 --> 2171.74
keeps coming back every year one way or

2169.79 --> 2173.96
the other it always finds a way to come

2171.74 --> 2176.8689999999997
back and then have to deal with it again

2173.96 --> 2178.94
and I've settled for that I can I can

2176.869 --> 2181.089
live with that for a very long time I

2178.94 --> 2181.089
hope

2184.48 --> 2192.0
but I do need to keep taking care of

2187.3 --> 2194.8900000000003
myself because if if I deplete myself

2192.0 --> 2198.01
then and then depression sets and then I

2194.89 --> 2200.71
got a big problem because then things

2198.01 --> 2204.0600000000004
may snap but yeah something like that

2200.71 --> 2204.06
hasn't happened for a long long time

2206.25 --> 2209.64
it's not gonna

2213.9 --> 2220.65
that literally have to be in prison and

2216.92 --> 2222.09
then not be properly nourished for years

2220.65 --> 2228.65
and then I'd be screwed

2222.09 --> 2231.2400000000002
I don't hopefully that's not coming I

2228.65 --> 2235.31
don't think so I don't even

2231.24 --> 2235.31
I've done nothing literally nothing

2247.57 --> 2254.13
mmm okay dinosaur Falcon should be

2252.91 --> 2257.35
careful with that

2254.13 --> 2259.36
look what I've experienced is that since

2257.35 --> 2261.97
I started eating organic food and

2259.36 --> 2264.6400000000003
dropping certain type of chemicals and

2261.97 --> 2268.93
all that I don't overeat anymore

2264.64 --> 2272.5299999999997
I when I started to eat organic what I

2268.93 --> 2274.8999999999996
noticed is that very quickly but the

2272.53 --> 2277.51
amount of food that I would really need

2274.9 --> 2279.9700000000003
to go around and like even if I could

2277.51 --> 2283.6000000000004
try to stuff myself further you know but

2279.97 --> 2287.5899999999997
effectively I ate half the amount after

2283.6 --> 2292.6
I started eating organic and that never

2287.59 --> 2296.59
really went away so it's really all

2292.6 --> 2300.42
about what you're eating because the

2296.59 --> 2303.8500000000004
food itself can make you overeat if it's

2300.42 --> 2306.85
it's not it's not entirely natural or

2303.85 --> 2310.14
the tinkered with ores spiced up with

2306.85 --> 2316.06
the chemicals gotta be careful

2310.14 --> 2321.6099999999997
especially msg Oh light therapy that's a

2316.06 --> 2324.16
good one well I got vitamin d3 and yeah

2321.61 --> 2328.84
so it does help but unfortunately it

2324.16 --> 2333.0099999999998
does not help me completely overcome the

2328.84 --> 2335.32
situation because nothing really does I

2333.01 --> 2338.7400000000002
experience it takes time it's really

2335.32 --> 2342.0
like a metabolic thing but it influences

2338.74 --> 2342.0
my psychology a lot

2348.76 --> 2357.3300000000004
vitamin D supplements gonna be dangerous

2351.52 --> 2357.33
well that all depends on the source

2357.36 --> 2367.15
you mean like raw minerals or very sure

2361.45 --> 2371.0499999999997
that this type of vitamin d3 it's not

2367.15 --> 2384.04
gonna do that at all see what it's made

2371.05 --> 2384.8900000000003
from god that are so small you see

2384.04 --> 2387.96
what's in there

2384.89 --> 2387.96
[Music]

2394.44 --> 2412.67
what is that

2396.6 --> 2420.27
sweet potato powder okay 593 crow coal a

2412.67 --> 2420.7200000000003
cow see Pharaoh contains soy that's just

2420.27 --> 2423.65
great

2420.72 --> 2423.6499999999996
whatever

2427.77 --> 2432.0099999999998
right

2429.97 --> 2444.66
but it seems most of it seems to be

2432.01 --> 2447.9700000000003
sweet potato powder-based I guess this

2444.66 --> 2450.19
right mark colors

2447.97 --> 2454.5099999999998
hey taking too much of anything is

2450.19 --> 2457.02
always going to be detrimental overdose

2454.51 --> 2457.0200000000004
of water

2480.069 --> 2482.7889999999998
hmm

2488.29 --> 2494.98
okay that drops awesome yeah there's all

2491.35 --> 2498.67
kinds of ways to do it too much vitamin

2494.98 --> 2500.98
C well no not really over Mukul that's

2498.67 --> 2505.08
one of the few things that is actually

2500.98 --> 2508.6
not you've got to like take insane

2505.08 --> 2512.56
amounts insane amounts that are like

2508.6 --> 2514.72
difficult to even consume that much to

2512.56 --> 2517.21
make it poisonous yeah

2514.72 --> 2519.54
because most of you but when you have

2517.21 --> 2522.85
too much vitamin C this is well known

2519.54 --> 2526.45
your body just dumps it dumb but you'll

2522.85 --> 2528.06
just piss it out again that's what

2526.45 --> 2531.97
happens

2528.06 --> 2534.75
it doesn't really damage you having too

2531.97 --> 2534.75
much not really

2540.569 --> 2544.079
at least the doctors are saying that

2542.699 --> 2546.2690000000002
while the doctors are not even

2544.079 --> 2548.9100000000003
officially advising vitamin C that's

2546.269 --> 2549.5589999999997
thanks to Codex Alimentarius among

2548.91 --> 2557.459
others

2549.559 --> 2559.7090000000003
you know vitamin C's fantastic all right

2557.459 --> 2561.8689999999997
well I don't take it all the time but I

2559.709 --> 2568.019
take it in periods and I do have it

2561.869 --> 2571.579
especially now I'm happy to have it so I

2568.019 --> 2577.41
got this vitamin C from Campbell berry

2571.579 --> 2580.039
and yeah practically got the whole

2577.41 --> 2583.2889999999998
bottle full so I don't really take that

2580.039 --> 2586.8900000000003
regularly but when I do feel like oh I

2583.289 --> 2590.9100000000003
feel like I could potentially get sick

2586.89 --> 2593.969
then I'll take it or when I'd like okay

2590.91 --> 2596.249
I have to go through a lot of a lot on a

2593.969 --> 2599.13
very very very very very shitty whether

2596.249 --> 2602.4289999999996
I'm gonna be demoralized by it then I

2599.13 --> 2605.009
probably take one like fifty minutes

2602.429 --> 2611.059
ahead of time just to kind of like make

2605.009 --> 2611.059
sure that I this is don't ruin myself

2612.229 --> 2620.009
but usually I don't even do that

2614.88 --> 2622.819
I just got it as a backup then I really

2620.009 --> 2622.819
need it I got it

2628.61 --> 2638.27
yeah but vitamin C is is in more than

2631.88 --> 2640.34
just supplements right I need to go for

2638.27 --> 2643.72
a bit I'll be back I will round out the

2640.34 --> 2643.7200000000003
show in five ten minutes

2739.469 --> 2755.9990000000003
yeah tea no I already finished most of

2744.699 --> 2755.9990000000003
this teapots mixes so I heard that

2766.17 --> 2773.339
well chou-heung cat that is hilarious

2769.609 --> 2777.869
do you remember it was when what it was

2773.339 --> 2779.7
during the Bush era after 9/11 happened

2777.869 --> 2784.7400000000002
at some point remembered that there was

2779.7 --> 2788.46
this comedian I think that did a joke

2784.74 --> 2792.99
just like that about the reporter if

2788.46 --> 2795.299
only some reporter like in the movies

2792.99 --> 2797.6699999999996
you know that they would actually do

2795.299 --> 2799.98
their job instead of just going along to

2797.67 --> 2802.529
get along or give me corrupted the

2799.98 --> 2806.279
system he made a joke about it like in

2802.529 --> 2809.76
2001 or something was or in 2002

2806.279 --> 2812.16
somewhere do you remember that that was

2809.76 --> 2816.599
mind blowing back then he was literally

2812.16 --> 2819.839
making a joke like underneath the

2816.599 --> 2824.19
canosa's of the of the Hawks in the face

2819.839 --> 2826.319
of everyone about how idiotic Lee

2824.19 --> 2832.009
corrupts the press was just going along

2826.319 --> 2835.64
and that was back then can you imagine

2832.009 --> 2841.46
how tense that was the bins

2835.64 --> 2841.46
do you remember I remember

2847.68 --> 2855.83
I wonder if if that video clip is still

2850.68 --> 2855.83
somewhere on YouTube it should be

2864.01 --> 2870.099
yeah in a way bait 60 RFC he was but I

2867.7 --> 2875.02
think that the controllers as it were

2870.099 --> 2878.349
did appreciate the hot spot of it and

2875.02 --> 2880.74
that that's because he was literally

2878.349 --> 2883.9
making a joke

2880.74 --> 2886.2099999999996
he wasn't like oh we have to stand up

2883.9 --> 2888.13
now we have to stop no he wasn't he was

2886.21 --> 2889.9
literally just making a joke of it and

2888.13 --> 2893.02
kind of shoving it in the world's face

2889.9 --> 2895.349
like yeah hello have you noticed that

2893.02 --> 2901.619
the press is completely worthless now

2895.349 --> 2901.619
and I wasn't 2001 or - can you imagine

2911.42 --> 2918.5
yeah chou-heung cat i thank you i thank

2914.599 --> 2921.7400000000002
you for that in a way that is kind of

2918.5 --> 2926.289
what i do i guess i just tried not to

2921.74 --> 2926.2889999999998
uncover too much because I don't what

2927.22 --> 2933.2889999999998
sometimes I just bump into things as I

2931.16 --> 2936.14
explore them in my mind that I just

2933.289 --> 2939.349
realized this is freaking dangerous I

2936.14 --> 2942.529
just not even gonna not even gonna let

2939.349 --> 2945.799
my mind touch that before I accidentally

2942.529 --> 2947.92
throw it out into the world because hey

2945.799 --> 2951.109
the just the sheer amount of

2947.92 --> 2953.869
possibilities just the possibilities in

2951.109 --> 2959.0
general of anything of technology of the

2953.869 --> 2963.549
mind it is it is almost seemingly

2959.0 --> 2967.96
unlimited but with it the dangers are

2963.549 --> 2967.96
also unlimited

2977.82 --> 2985.5
but I definitely do try to yeah help

2983.43 --> 2988.5499999999997
people figure out just how to be

2985.5 --> 2993.36
self-sufficient how to not be tricked

2988.55 --> 2994.04
too much and all that it's for myself

2993.36 --> 2997.38
too

2994.04 --> 2999.84
and I pick up I've picked up on a lot of

2997.38 --> 3003.17
details from many people out here on

2999.84 --> 3005.84
YouTube and in my chat and just little

3003.17 --> 3007.67
tidbits that to them they think oh yeah

3005.84 --> 3012.17
that just seems normal sensible and then

3007.67 --> 3015.7400000000002
I'm like heat I yeah it does I never

3012.17 --> 3018.86
even consciously thought about that the

3015.74 --> 3024.02
subject but it does make sense and then

3018.86 --> 3026.3
it yeah integrates so yeah I give out I

3024.02 --> 3031.31
try to give out good advice but at the

3026.3 --> 3034.4
same time yeah I do also get enrich

3031.31 --> 3038.38
myself with more information through

3034.4 --> 3043.84
other people hmm super chat not working

3038.38 --> 3043.84

it's like it hasn't changed the number

3102.77 --> 3108.29
it's almost like they act it into the

3106.19 --> 3111.23
scream and they're not showing what is

3108.29 --> 3115.61
real anymore because it just hasn't

3111.23 --> 3116.03
changed anymore at all not even up and

3115.61 --> 3119.69
down

long time ago now wrenches are just

3151.64 --> 3156.31
right yeah I took it out good

3165.17 --> 3171.529
now yeah it did that's what it says tiny

3168.049 --> 3174.5
womble but you can actually look to the

3171.529 --> 3179.269
exact number and it's been sixteen

3174.5 --> 3181.72
hundred and eighty for a long time not

3179.269 --> 3181.72
the K

3195.579 --> 3200.559
hmm

3197.349 --> 3201.009

being a full hour try to start up

3221.979 --> 3227.049
having a bit of trouble recently

3223.089 --> 3230.049
starting up also just not much mustering

3227.049 --> 3233.38
the the momentum remember because I am

3230.049 --> 3235.119
in kind of a slightly feeble situation

3233.38 --> 3237.5190000000002
so it's a bit more difficult for me to

3235.119 --> 3239.339
find that moment I guess that is also a

3237.519 --> 3243.9399999999996
reason why I start up a little late
