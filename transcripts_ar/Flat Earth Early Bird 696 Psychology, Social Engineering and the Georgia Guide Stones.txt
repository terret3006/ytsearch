twice

250.52 --> 255.84
[Music]

253.12 --> 255.84
right

260.72 --> 265.68
yeah uh flat earth debate yesterday was

264.4 --> 269.75899999999996
pretty damn good

265.68 --> 271.12
it was very intense a typical monday

269.759 --> 276.88
show and i was

271.12 --> 276.88
yeah on point as well so was the rest

280.88 --> 287.919
oh yeah some netflix issues yeah i also

284.639 --> 291.04
there was owen benjamin life

287.919 --> 293.52
and yeah it was just

291.04 --> 295.28000000000003
detailing in morality and all that and

293.52 --> 298.08
the concept of

295.28 --> 299.84
thieves as well like thievery what they

298.08 --> 302.639
are in the face of scheme and

299.84 --> 303.19899999999996
i don't know yeah i don't remember a lot

302.639 --> 304.96000000000004
about it

303.199 --> 307.199
right now but that's the note that i

304.96 --> 307.19899999999996
made

308.72 --> 313.36
i don't remember if i watched the whole

310.32 --> 317.919
thing i think i got distracted

313.36 --> 320.88
uh also yeah some netflix

317.919 --> 322.56
things apparently there was a trailer

320.88 --> 324.71999999999997
i've never seen that before there was a

322.56 --> 326.479
trailer of a movie to come out in

324.72 --> 329.36
october

326.479 --> 331.36
called over the moon i've never seen a

329.36 --> 333.44
trailer before netflix

331.36 --> 334.56
they usually just play the movie but now

333.44 --> 339.84
i saw a trailer

334.56 --> 342.479
i was kind of surprised uh

339.84 --> 344.32
but apparently there is this sort of

342.479 --> 347.84
fantasy

344.32 --> 350.15999999999997
based cartoon or animated film

347.84 --> 352.08
coming out that has something to do with

350.16 --> 354.32000000000005
the moon and

352.08 --> 355.199
yeah a little kid and their ideas about

354.32 --> 358.639
the moon so

355.199 --> 360.0
that's i guess interesting that could be

358.639 --> 364.319
interesting the

360.0 --> 367.36
trailer seemed halfway interesting

364.319 --> 369.28000000000003
or not not really it just kind of

367.36 --> 370.639
makes me wonder like okay i wonder what

369.28 --> 373.59999999999997
they're gonna do

370.639 --> 375.84000000000003
with it at the moon because it is a

373.6 --> 378.96000000000004
weird thing isn't it

375.84 --> 382.31899999999996
and i think some of that

378.96 --> 384.88
yeah that esoteric feeling

382.319 --> 385.759
has been inserted into this movie

384.88 --> 389.52
whatever it's

385.759 --> 391.84000000000003
gonna turn out to be so yeah

389.52 --> 395.039
very curious what's what it's gonna turn

391.84 --> 398.23999999999995
out to be

395.039 --> 398.8
anybody else picked up on that right

398.24 --> 403.52
anyway

398.8 --> 408.56
hello amanda young f3 stop motion

403.52 --> 411.52
right also was surprised to see

408.56 --> 414.319
star trek discovery a new episode of the

411.52 --> 414.31899999999996
third season

415.199 --> 423.12
and that was unexpected i thought that

420.319 --> 423.599
the serie had discontinued i don't know

423.12 --> 426.24
why

423.599 --> 427.759
not that anybody told me but i was just

426.24 --> 431.52
so

427.759 --> 434.8
ugh i was kind of like nauseated

431.52 --> 437.599
at the last at the end of the last

434.8 --> 439.28000000000003
season because it was just so flashy and

437.599 --> 441.44
so

439.28 --> 442.79999999999995
rushed it seemed like they just filled

441.44 --> 444.86
it up with cgi

442.8 --> 446.56
and just

444.86 --> 449.28000000000003
[Music]

446.56 --> 450.0
like the whole sense of the story and

449.28 --> 453.52
the time

450.0 --> 456.639
travel plot that they're trying to pull

453.52 --> 459.599
it just became so convoluted to me

456.639 --> 462.24
now might be something really smart

459.599 --> 464.0
behind it that'll reveal itself at the

462.24 --> 468.16
end of season three

464.0 --> 470.08
but yeah the cgi nausea still

468.16 --> 471.59900000000005
still like ruined it for me and i

470.08 --> 475.68
commented about that

471.599 --> 480.319
but this time it seemed different

475.68 --> 483.52
it seemed like it wasn't yeah it was

480.319 --> 483.91900000000004
into the future right did you pretty

483.52 --> 486.15999999999997
much

483.919 --> 487.75899999999996
get that right away it was and kind of

486.16 --> 489.28000000000003
like the idea of being a little bit more

487.759 --> 493.199
stuck there

489.28 --> 495.67999999999995
and a calm

493.199 --> 497.28000000000003
overview they didn't get so freaking

495.68 --> 499.44
flashy this time

497.28 --> 501.039
and it was kind of interesting and

499.44 --> 504.8
weirdly enough

501.039 --> 508.71999999999997
this new world

504.8 --> 510.72
kind of reminded me a lot about

508.72 --> 512.9590000000001
might be a coincidence or maybe it's

510.72 --> 513.279
heavily inspired because of the success

512.959 --> 516.0799999999999
of

513.279 --> 517.279
the conceptual medium it seemed a lot

516.08 --> 520.479
like it was like that

517.279 --> 521.36
the planet from star wars the desert

520.479 --> 524.64
planet

521.36 --> 527.519
and the bar like i got feeling off like

524.64 --> 529.4399999999999
the space bar scene eventually not

527.519 --> 532.48
exactly like that not as

529.44 --> 536.1600000000001
thick on top but

532.48 --> 538.72
i just was like hmm this feels vaguely

536.16 --> 542.0799999999999
familiar but i kind of like the way they

538.72 --> 543.6
they put it all down more so it got me

542.08 --> 546.64
curious like okay

543.6 --> 548.32
okay if you're gonna do this well maybe

546.64 --> 549.36
the third season is gonna be kind of

548.32 --> 552.6400000000001
different

549.36 --> 556.399
we'll see picard show sucks

552.64 --> 559.279
yeah yeah i have to agree with that

556.399 --> 560.56
i i have it on my computer i didn't get

559.279 --> 562.72
like

560.56 --> 564.7199999999999
i at some point i just couldn't watch

562.72 --> 567.12
anymore

564.72 --> 570.08
i don't even care to remember why i just

567.12 --> 570.08
thought it was just

570.56 --> 578.16
it i don't know how to explain it

574.08 --> 580.0
but they got like the tone of the whole

578.16 --> 583.04
thing is wrong

580.0 --> 584.24
like they put out this dramatic oh it's

583.04 --> 587.68
so important

584.24 --> 591.839
where the the good guys and it it's off

587.68 --> 591.8389999999999
it's just off it's just something

595.68 --> 603.279
it's creepy i found picard the series

598.959 --> 604.7199999999999
creepy so i discontinued that but star

603.279 --> 607.8389999999999
trek discovery

604.72 --> 610.88
yeah it just kind of nauseated me but it

607.839 --> 612.8800000000001
yeah i explained earlier i i did really

610.88 --> 616.56
like some character

612.88 --> 617.12
arcs in the series and also character

616.56 --> 619.1999999999999
growth

617.12 --> 621.279
it had some good traits it's just that

619.2 --> 624.6400000000001
the cgi was so overwhelming that

621.279 --> 624.64
literally nauseated me

630.16 --> 637.12
never been a fan of star trek oh okay

633.519 --> 639.2
i get that there's a lot of issues with

637.12 --> 639.2
it

643.279 --> 648.959
but yeah i just i don't know if i happen

646.32 --> 648.9590000000001
to be a fan

654.72 --> 659.0400000000001
but yeah not all the series

659.36 --> 665.36
it's like half of them there's some i

662.399 --> 667.68
kind of literally skipped i just didn't

665.36 --> 667.6800000000001
do it

671.2 --> 676.0790000000001
yeah there's been from that i know of

674.399 --> 679.04
now three series that i've

676.079 --> 679.4399999999999
persistently not watched in the star cha

679.04 --> 685.279
track

679.44 --> 685.2790000000001
franchise let's just don't want to watch

685.49 --> 689.839
[Music]

686.839 --> 689.839
it

694.079 --> 697.76
anyway uh right so that happened just

696.72 --> 701.12
one episode

697.76 --> 703.519
uh after that

701.12 --> 706.16
was pretty much just gaming lots and

703.519 --> 709.36
lots of gaming for me

706.16 --> 710.16
kind of trying to calm down because it's

709.36 --> 716.8000000000001
like really

710.16 --> 719.12
cold nights and i get a little restless

716.8 --> 719.12
right

720.959 --> 724.7199999999999
and there were some streams and

722.56 --> 731.04
premieres and it just

724.72 --> 734.399
looked into it and moved on

731.04 --> 736.48
all right i think i ended

734.399 --> 738.16
not really paying too close attention

736.48 --> 742.32
because it was just generalized

738.16 --> 745.8389999999999
stuff it i watched lift the veil

742.32 --> 745.839
pretty much before going to bed

746.56 --> 751.8389999999999
but yeah he just had like pro oh look

748.8 --> 755.68
the preliminary readouts

751.839 --> 755.6800000000001
oh really that's so reliable

756.839 --> 759.839
about

761.04 --> 764.88
yeah about the u.s elections

767.04 --> 770.56
uh by the way thank you every stop

768.959 --> 772.88
motion for the five dollar super chat

770.56 --> 787.8389999999999
donation that's nice

772.88 --> 787.8389999999999
who's gonna win trump or biden i died

790.48 --> 793.76
i don't know man with the way things are

792.079 --> 795.279
set up i'm pretty sure that trump's

793.76 --> 797.4399999999999
gonna win

795.279 --> 800.079
unless he literally throws the hat in

797.44 --> 802.32
the ring for some reason

800.079 --> 802.3199999999999
but

803.2 --> 806.399
yeah i don't think so

810.72 --> 815.839
but that's not the end of it it's pretty

812.32 --> 815.839
much just the beginning you know

823.44 --> 828.5600000000001
this is just everybody getting excited

826.079 --> 830.56
for the starting signal

828.56 --> 831.76
because when the elections are done

830.56 --> 834.399
that's when the

831.76 --> 834.8
yeah that's when the the real attention

834.399 --> 837.519
drive

834.8 --> 838.3199999999999
grabby chaos is gonna be unleashed

837.519 --> 843.76
that's when they're

838.32 --> 845.5500000000001
really gonna start to get on your nerves

843.76 --> 847.36
one way or the other

845.55 --> 850.16
[Music]

847.36 --> 852.0790000000001
because they're set to basically unleash

850.16 --> 856.399
like they can't handle they can't

852.079 --> 859.199
contain it anymore right

856.399 --> 860.88
yeah the the marxist the extreme left

859.199 --> 864.0
they can't contain it anymore they

860.88 --> 866.48
they want the power now

864.0 --> 866.48
to just

867.44 --> 870.5600000000001
so yeah if biden's gonna win they're

869.839 --> 873.7600000000001
gonna get

870.56 --> 876.3199999999999
freaking stassi [ __ ] that that just

873.76 --> 877.12
they're just gonna take that under the

876.32 --> 879.839
cover of

877.12 --> 881.68
who's in power they're just gonna get

879.839 --> 884.8000000000001
super thuggish

881.68 --> 887.8389999999999
right and covered up

884.8 --> 889.5999999999999
by very creepy smiley-faced media

887.839 --> 893.12
you all know this that that's gonna

889.6 --> 894.8000000000001
happen if biden would actually win

893.12 --> 896.9590000000001
and then of course there's there would

894.8 --> 898.079
be a giant follow-up of investigation

896.959 --> 899.5999999999999
for what the hell happened

898.079 --> 903.279
during the elections where did all the

899.6 --> 906.72
ballots go blah blah blah and of course

903.279 --> 908.88
biden could only ever win through

906.72 --> 911.0400000000001
yeah giant concerted fraud efforts

908.88 --> 912.88
because he's just kind of a useless dead

911.04 --> 914.56
puppet on top

912.88 --> 916.16
sometimes i think he they put him on

914.56 --> 918.079
there just to make them

916.16 --> 920.639
seem a little bit more harmless or

918.079 --> 922.2399999999999
something doesn't make any sense really

920.639 --> 923.92
but

922.24 --> 926.32
oh thank you for the five dollar super

923.92 --> 928.079
chat donation

926.32 --> 930.48
[Music]

928.079 --> 932.7199999999999
thank you amanda young good luck with

930.48 --> 936.8000000000001
the work

932.72 --> 939.12
see you next time uh right but it's

936.8 --> 940.639
it's much more likely that that trump's

939.12 --> 944.399
just gonna win but if that's gonna

940.639 --> 946.88
happen yeah the left is gonna go

944.399 --> 948.8
so triggered if you think they were

946.88 --> 951.12
triggered the last time trump won you

948.8 --> 953.04
ain't seen nothing

951.12 --> 955.519
and they're i don't know they're gonna

953.04 --> 958.88
try if they if that happens it's much

955.519 --> 962.639
more likely to happen they're gonna

958.88 --> 965.36
either basically freeze up

962.639 --> 967.04
[ __ ] their pants and retreat like

965.36 --> 968.9590000000001
feeling like they're gonna be executed

967.04 --> 970.24
get really paranoid some of them will

968.959 --> 974.079
get this

970.24 --> 977.04
and others will just go out in a rage

974.079 --> 977.92
they will try to do scorched earth

977.04 --> 979.8389999999999
policy

977.92 --> 981.12
they might even burn their own house

979.839 --> 983.44
down really guys

981.12 --> 984.24
like and then try to blame it on you but

983.44 --> 989.0400000000001
seriously

984.24 --> 991.92
that sort of [ __ ] it's gonna go nuts

989.04 --> 993.5999999999999
so yeah they're gonna go nuts one way or

991.92 --> 997.2299999999999
the other

993.6 --> 1000.359
see that's my prediction

997.23 --> 1000.359
[Music]

1005.83 --> 1009.629
[Music]

1014.24 --> 1021.44
oh all right thank you f3 stop motion i

1018.72 --> 1021.44
appreciate that

1022.839 --> 1026.959
huh

1025.28 --> 1029.76
and yeah i also appreciate your

1026.959 --> 1029.76
contributions

1031.919 --> 1036.16
oh i i appreciate a little less your

1035.52 --> 1038.799
most

1036.16 --> 1040.16
more personal inquis inquisitory

1038.799 --> 1042.72
questions

1040.16 --> 1044.559
but i've addressed that yesterday and

1042.72 --> 1049.3600000000001
you're not doing it right now so

1044.559 --> 1049.36
i shouldn't even bring it up but yeah

1049.84 --> 1054.799
i'm happy i i didn't ban you even though

1052.24 --> 1056.96
you really

1054.799 --> 1060.559
made me hover over that button sometimes

1056.96 --> 1063.919
and i'm not the only one here

1060.559 --> 1067.84
but yeah i guess you gotta

1063.919 --> 1067.8400000000001
push it to test it

1076.48 --> 1081.84
right so anything else

1090.16 --> 1096.64
add humor into the mix all right

1093.52 --> 1099.039
uh i get that

1096.64 --> 1101.1200000000001
i think a lot of people in chat like to

1099.039 --> 1103.76
do that

1101.12 --> 1105.1999999999998
it's just that i don't really like it

1103.76 --> 1108.48
when

1105.2 --> 1109.76
it's me that's kind of been turned into

1108.48 --> 1112.799
the figure of

1109.76 --> 1113.919
oh look at the funny dancing puppet look

1112.799 --> 1117.36
at what he does

1113.919 --> 1119.44
that that i don't appreciate that and

1117.36 --> 1121.28
i don't know maybe i'm a little touchy

1119.44 --> 1122.16
with that sometimes but that's also

1121.28 --> 1126.0
because

1122.16 --> 1128.64
that's what trolls have been doing see

1126.0 --> 1130.64
you understand like really nasty trolls

1128.64 --> 1134.0
now you're not a nasty troll

1130.64 --> 1137.2800000000002
that i've been able to do that so far

1134.0 --> 1140.64
at least but yeah i was kind of like

1137.28 --> 1143.36
what is what is this because

1140.64 --> 1145.8400000000001
yeah there's been trolls that typically

1143.36 --> 1145.84
do that

1147.12 --> 1154.0
see like that do that

1151.28 --> 1155.28
that know me they know about me but they

1154.0 --> 1158.32
want to ask those

1155.28 --> 1162.0
questions to to kind of like draw away

1158.32 --> 1163.84
make it personal and yeah that's the

1162.0 --> 1165.039
the nastiness of the trolls it's their

1163.84 --> 1166.9599999999998
tactics

1165.039 --> 1169.36
they have like this statistical

1166.96 --> 1172.559
influencing tactics kind of thing

1169.36 --> 1176.32
going on it's it's natural it's creepy

1172.559 --> 1179.44
but that's what they do and yeah

1176.32 --> 1180.32
if you start to have those type of

1179.44 --> 1182.48
behaviors

1180.32 --> 1184.559
then yeah it's no surprise that people

1182.48 --> 1187.28
be like hey

1184.559 --> 1189.6
is this a troll is this one of them

1187.28 --> 1189.6
again

1190.84 --> 1193.84
see

1196.08 --> 1211.819
yeah but i'm glad you're with us now

1206.03 --> 1211.819
[Music]

1232.84 --> 1235.84
so

1238.64 --> 1245.44
oh yeah i also re-watched the pandemic

1241.76 --> 1245.44
special again from south park

1245.919 --> 1253.2
remember that just rewatched it again to

1249.919 --> 1255.919
see if there was something else and yeah

1253.2 --> 1255.919
i had this

1256.4 --> 1260.5590000000002
this weird sensation all of a sudden but

1259.2 --> 1262.96
this could literally

1260.559 --> 1263.76
be just the typical south parakeean

1262.96 --> 1268.799
foresight

1263.76 --> 1271.2
that's just unfathomable sometimes

1268.799 --> 1273.28
because of the patterns of what they do

1271.2 --> 1275.8400000000001
or maybe they actually do know

1273.28 --> 1276.799
some weird [ __ ] for some creepy circles

1275.84 --> 1278.6399999999999
or something

1276.799 --> 1280.32
i don't know man i don't know these guys

1278.64 --> 1281.6000000000001
too well they're they're they are kind

1280.32 --> 1285.6
of weirdos

1281.6 --> 1288.08
south park is awesome i love it uh

1285.6 --> 1288.8799999999999
even though it's [ __ ] up a lot of the

1288.08 --> 1291.28
times but

1288.88 --> 1292.5590000000002
it's it's at least consistently [ __ ]

1291.28 --> 1295.12
up

1292.559 --> 1297.6
doesn't draw you deeper into hell really

1295.12 --> 1299.6789999999999
it's it's very confronting

1297.6 --> 1300.799
it's very confronting about humanity and

1299.679 --> 1304.4
i like that

1300.799 --> 1305.52
but i just there's this long-running

1304.4 --> 1307.8400000000001
plot

1305.52 --> 1310.72
pretty much and the pandemic special

1307.84 --> 1312.559
kind of rounds that out

1310.72 --> 1313.84
although it may not be over that like

1312.559 --> 1317.52
stan's dead

1313.84 --> 1321.28
randy went to wuhan remember for his

1317.52 --> 1324.6399999999999
pandemic special made the chinese people

1321.28 --> 1327.76
like make that [ __ ] or did

1324.64 --> 1332.5590000000002
a really convoluted plot that's like

1327.76 --> 1335.12
playing it and then this scandal happens

1332.559 --> 1336.08
where he went there with disney and had

1335.12 --> 1338.9599999999998
sex

1336.08 --> 1340.72
with animals like the craziest [ __ ]

1338.96 --> 1341.3600000000001
that's they're pretty much the subject

1340.72 --> 1343.52
of it

1341.36 --> 1345.6789999999999
and then it's associated with with the

1343.52 --> 1349.28
karuna virus right

1345.679 --> 1351.52
but now also it just made me feel like

1349.28 --> 1354.24
yeah

1351.52 --> 1354.559
this story with biden's son and what he

1354.24 --> 1358.08
did

1354.559 --> 1360.6399999999999
and [ __ ] up it's

1358.08 --> 1362.799
it's almost like it kind of read like

1360.64 --> 1365.039
that part of that story is now

1362.799 --> 1366.96
starting to kind of resonate like in

1365.039 --> 1370.799
like how insane it was being

1366.96 --> 1373.44
drugs and and doing business

1370.799 --> 1374.8799999999999
because that is what he was doing there

1373.44 --> 1376.24
that's what randy was doing there was

1374.88 --> 1380.24
doing business right it's

1376.24 --> 1384.64
like damn have they actually kind of

1380.24 --> 1384.64
soft covertly echoed this

1384.799 --> 1388.0
see it's these little things that

1387.36 --> 1390.32
sometimes

1388.0 --> 1392.159
just baffle me about southwark you watch

1390.32 --> 1394.799
it and you're like whoa yeah that's

1392.159 --> 1396.3200000000002
that is like very well thought out then

1394.799 --> 1400.08
things start to happen

1396.32 --> 1404.0
in the real world it's like wait

1400.08 --> 1407.039
no what the [ __ ]

1404.0 --> 1409.039
that reminds me a lot of what i saw

1407.039 --> 1411.36
there

1409.039 --> 1414.32
anybody else got this from watching the

1411.36 --> 1414.32
pandemic special

1415.6 --> 1420.08
all right it's it's hard not to have it

1418.08 --> 1423.039
there's so many correlations

1420.08 --> 1423.039
for what's going on

1424.799 --> 1428.08
like even the genetic modification [ __ ]

1427.52 --> 1431.12
and but

1428.08 --> 1432.6399999999999
yeah it came out pretty recently so they

1431.12 --> 1435.279
had a lot of

1432.64 --> 1436.88
situations that were going to unfold

1435.279 --> 1439.2
already had to look in today

1436.88 --> 1441.6000000000001
they could have easily had access to

1439.2 --> 1445.8400000000001
what is about to unfold and worked it

1441.6 --> 1445.84
into their play

1451.44 --> 1459.679
is that a rhetorical question not not

1454.559 --> 1463.12
but have you ever considered it

1459.679 --> 1463.1200000000001
what is what's the problem

1464.08 --> 1467.1999999999998
why do you think i need to see a

1465.6 --> 1470.24
psychologist

1467.2 --> 1472.72
i pretty much am a psychologist every

1470.24 --> 1475.919
time i have seen a psychologist

1472.72 --> 1478.08
and i've seen some no psychiatrist

1475.919 --> 1480.24
but i've seen some because especially my

1478.08 --> 1482.559
teen times i had a lot of issues

1480.24 --> 1485.76
especially with like

1482.559 --> 1488.72
i didn't really like myself right

1485.76 --> 1490.32
but yeah every time i got to talk with

1488.72 --> 1493.919
them

1490.32 --> 1496.8799999999999
i'd end up teaching

1493.919 --> 1497.679
them about psychology in order to

1496.88 --> 1500.7990000000002
explain

1497.679 --> 1505.279
how i work because i know it much

1500.799 --> 1507.6
better than any psychologist

1505.279 --> 1509.76
because i'm a better psychologist than

1507.6 --> 1512.1589999999999
any other psychologist i've ever met

1509.76 --> 1513.12
now there are some very old

1512.159 --> 1515.3600000000001
psychologists

1513.12 --> 1519.12
that have built up a lot of wisdom now i

1515.36 --> 1521.279
might not be able to match that wisdom

1519.12 --> 1522.4799999999998
for example in the region of social

1521.279 --> 1525.6
dynamics

1522.48 --> 1528.32
but when it comes to introspective

1525.6 --> 1528.8799999999999
the mechanics of the introspective i've

1528.32 --> 1530.96
never met

1528.88 --> 1533.0390000000002
anybody that has mastered that

1530.96 --> 1536.24
conception more than i have

1533.039 --> 1537.84
ever so

1536.24 --> 1538.73
i don't really need to see a

1537.84 --> 1540.72
psychologist

1538.73 --> 1543.919
[Laughter]

1540.72 --> 1546.64
but you can't see me if you think

1543.919 --> 1546.64
that might help

1551.12 --> 1556.2399999999998
yeah yeah but what what exactly do i

1553.679 --> 1571.8400000000001
need help with

1556.24 --> 1571.84
hawkeye pierce what's the problem

1581.919 --> 1590.159
hmm okay that's an interesting statement

1585.6 --> 1594.559
zemia repulsa

1590.159 --> 1597.3600000000001
that is yeah that is techn mechanically

1594.559 --> 1599.039
it's true to some extent although the

1597.36 --> 1602.7199999999998
neurotic person

1599.039 --> 1606.0
problematically has the tendency to let

1602.72 --> 1606.799
their subconscious take over their their

1606.0 --> 1608.72
obsession

1606.799 --> 1610.08
that's really the neurosis that's a

1608.72 --> 1611.84
problem they get stuck

1610.08 --> 1614.3999999999999
into an auto cycle that shouldn't be

1611.84 --> 1616.3999999999999
there right while the psychotic

1614.4 --> 1617.52
has a very different natured problem

1616.4 --> 1620.3200000000002
they lose

1617.52 --> 1621.9189999999999
grasp they can't understand anymore what

1620.32 --> 1625.12
they're dealing with

1621.919 --> 1627.5200000000002
or their entire

1625.12 --> 1629.039
this is even worse that although it

1627.52 --> 1631.6399999999999
doesn't happen that enough that's like

1629.039 --> 1633.08
real bad insanity their entire

1631.64 --> 1636.7990000000002
consciousness

1633.08 --> 1639.6
manifestation becomes fragmented

1636.799 --> 1640.559
so they they form they shape their

1639.6 --> 1644.0
personality

1640.559 --> 1645.6
in a way that is unnatural that's really

1644.0 --> 1650.0
creepy

1645.6 --> 1650.48
psychotic it happens sometimes to some

1650.0 --> 1652.399
people

1650.48 --> 1655.279
when they're under yeah when they've

1652.399 --> 1657.6
taken extreme drugs

1655.279 --> 1658.799
it's sometimes something like that

1657.6 --> 1662.48
happens it's really

1658.799 --> 1664.8799999999999
especially if the if they get into a bad

1662.48 --> 1668.72
trip and then really

1664.88 --> 1670.96
like change and they get stuck into

1668.72 --> 1672.0
this discontorted consciousness

1670.96 --> 1675.1200000000001
manifestation

1672.0 --> 1679.12
[ __ ] up ugh

1675.12 --> 1680.8799999999999
like i have like been there even through

1679.12 --> 1682.799
just cannabis

1680.88 --> 1684.48
by accident but i would always get out

1682.799 --> 1686.1589999999999
of it

1684.48 --> 1688.799
because it's literally chemically

1686.159 --> 1691.2
induced and i have a lot of strength

1688.799 --> 1693.679
in my character cohesion i had to build

1691.2 --> 1693.679
that up

1694.84 --> 1699.12
so

1696.399 --> 1700.6399999999999
despite my emotions often being very

1699.12 --> 1704.9599999999998
strong

1700.64 --> 1707.8400000000001
i've accounted for that inconvenience

1704.96 --> 1708.3990000000001
by being very strong and always getting

1707.84 --> 1710.48
it back

1708.399 --> 1712.08
like always getting the lid back on top

1710.48 --> 1715.6
that's the trick it's like

1712.08 --> 1719.12
and then okay i'm back works

1715.6 --> 1723.4399999999998
really well so

1719.12 --> 1726.4799999999998
yeah psychotic nature me

1723.44 --> 1729.76
very very

1726.48 --> 1733.919
yeah very unlikely

1729.76 --> 1737.08
because i've been in states in the past

1733.919 --> 1738.3200000000002
like after the period after i yeah my ex

1737.08 --> 1739.6
ex-girlfriend

1738.32 --> 1741.4399999999998
broke up with me and kicked me out of

1739.6 --> 1744.08
the house pretty much

1741.44 --> 1745.039
that was so mortifying for me at the

1744.08 --> 1748.24
time

1745.039 --> 1750.96
that my body was just exploding

1748.24 --> 1751.44
like i my body was trying to rip itself

1750.96 --> 1754.559
apart

1751.44 --> 1756.159
from the grief at times and i would yeah

1754.559 --> 1757.9189999999999
this sounds weird i've said it before

1756.159 --> 1761.2
i'm just gonna say it because this

1757.919 --> 1763.1200000000001
is real and i learned from it and that's

1761.2 --> 1766.72
why i'm not afraid of it anymore

1763.12 --> 1769.039
i would be on the floor like talking to

1766.72 --> 1771.1200000000001
for example a doctor like help me i need

1769.039 --> 1774.399
something to get the nausea away

1771.12 --> 1776.559
like drooling on the floor feeling

1774.399 --> 1778.559
almost so weak that i really didn't want

1776.559 --> 1783.52
to move too much

1778.559 --> 1785.9189999999999
but my mind was clear as [ __ ]

1783.52 --> 1788.799
just as it is now to that level and it

1785.919 --> 1791.1200000000001
can explain exactly what was going on

1788.799 --> 1792.96
the process is what i would feel why

1791.12 --> 1794.8799999999999
would happen how it reflected upon

1792.96 --> 1798.64
certain memories in the past

1794.88 --> 1802.0
perfect oversight no psychosis

1798.64 --> 1805.2
whatsoever but my body was just [ __ ]

1802.0 --> 1808.399
now that's more

1805.2 --> 1812.0800000000002
me my my mind does not

1808.399 --> 1812.08
yeah lose cohesion like that

1812.72 --> 1815.6000000000001
it never does

1816.32 --> 1820.0
[Music]

1818.08 --> 1821.76
like the worst i can get in losing

1820.0 --> 1825.12
cohesion is innate

1821.76 --> 1827.279
communication and i get super

1825.12 --> 1829.279
tired out and frustrated that

1827.279 --> 1833.2
combination then

1829.279 --> 1836.32
yeah it just it falters and then yeah it

1833.2 --> 1838.64
is not as cohesive but that's more just

1836.32 --> 1843.84
a communication that cuts it off

1838.64 --> 1843.8400000000001
i i don't yeah i'm not

1844.48 --> 1851.84
i'm very consistent and cohesive

1848.88 --> 1851.8400000000001
in my thoughts

1852.799 --> 1859.36
and yeah my entire youtube history is

1856.32 --> 1863.2
proof of that i'm an

1859.36 --> 1865.12
open studyable person

1863.2 --> 1866.559
and i'm very open and honest i've

1865.12 --> 1869.12
addressed these things

1866.559 --> 1869.9189999999999
since the beginning and i've changed

1869.12 --> 1872.799
grown better

1869.919 --> 1875.919
addressed issues try to improve upon it

1872.799 --> 1879.84
and then mastered it

1875.919 --> 1883.8400000000001
all here on youtube for everyone to see

1879.84 --> 1883.84
to show that it can be done

1885.44 --> 1889.76
as proof you know because a lot of

1888.0 --> 1890.799
people that are in that state i used to

1889.76 --> 1892.64
be one of them

1890.799 --> 1894.24
right this that's kind of part of the

1892.64 --> 1895.3600000000001
reason why i'm doing this because i wish

1894.24 --> 1898.559
somebody

1895.36 --> 1898.9599999999998
i knew would had done that so that i

1898.559 --> 1902.559
would

1898.96 --> 1905.039
know and trust that you can actually

1902.559 --> 1908.1589999999999
overcome certain things and why

1905.039 --> 1909.76
because i didn't know i had like

1908.159 --> 1911.519
people say yeah you'll get better you

1909.76 --> 1914.0
get some wisdom but i would

1911.519 --> 1916.88
feel so screwed up and when you feel so

1914.0 --> 1919.84
screwed up and so bad about yourself

1916.88 --> 1922.0800000000002
that you feel incompetent you can't

1919.84 --> 1925.039
imagine

1922.08 --> 1926.8799999999999
how that's ever going to change and this

1925.039 --> 1928.64
is typical teenage problem by the way

1926.88 --> 1930.0
with people that have like extreme

1928.64 --> 1932.72
emotions during their teen years

1930.0 --> 1935.279
especially depression related

1932.72 --> 1935.919
they can't imagine that that's gonna go

1935.279 --> 1938.08
any better

1935.919 --> 1940.72
no they can only imagine that's the rest

1938.08 --> 1944.399
of their life

1940.72 --> 1947.679
so you need a literal

1944.399 --> 1950.8799999999999
proof example

1947.679 --> 1953.679
to kind of know you can get out of that

1950.88 --> 1956.3990000000001
and then you can try to resonate that

1953.679 --> 1960.0800000000002
adapt that focus on that away

1956.399 --> 1963.1999999999998
from that still image of eternal

1960.08 --> 1966.0
doom that is inside of you there

1963.2 --> 1967.919
and replace it see but you got to know

1966.0 --> 1969.84
it's real just as saying oh it'll get

1967.919 --> 1972.24
better it doesn't work

1969.84 --> 1973.6
that's that sounds more like people

1972.24 --> 1976.32
trying to get rid of you

1973.6 --> 1977.039
like no you just easily fix it stop

1976.32 --> 1979.76
bothering me

1977.039 --> 1982.48
that's what that is to people that feel

1979.76 --> 1982.48
really shitty

1982.64 --> 1987.919
right luckily enough i don't really feel

1986.559 --> 1992.24
that shitty about myself

1987.919 --> 1995.3600000000001
anymore i i do still have grief and [ __ ]

1992.24 --> 1997.279
just heartaches about things but i at

1995.36 --> 2000.32
least

1997.279 --> 2005.84
feel more confident i have more trust in

2000.32 --> 2005.84
myself i have trust that i'll

2006.32 --> 2010.08
find something to balance it out with

2008.799 --> 2013.84
that i'll be able to make

2010.08 --> 2013.84
some good things to basically

2014.08 --> 2023.76
you know that yeah

2019.44 --> 2026.48
to make it all right anyway so yeah

2023.76 --> 2027.21
so again about me needing to see a

2026.48 --> 2030.309
psychologist

2027.21 --> 2030.309
[Music]

2030.84 --> 2033.84
anything

2044.84 --> 2047.84
so

2052.079 --> 2055.52
that who am i kidding of course hawkeye

2055.04 --> 2057.44
pierce

2055.52 --> 2059.7599999999998
was just the troll because he pretty

2057.44 --> 2062.32
much put a lid on it

2059.76 --> 2064.32
after i started explaining all this

2062.32 --> 2067.2000000000003
right

2064.32 --> 2067.679
maybe he realized oh [ __ ] maybe this is

2067.2 --> 2071.6789999999996
just

2067.679 --> 2071.679
my misery projecting on him

2072.96 --> 2077.2
well i pretty much handed you a ticket

2076.56 --> 2079.359
out

2077.2 --> 2080.96
how you can get out of it what i've been

2079.359 --> 2083.119
doing here

2080.96 --> 2084.079
you know because i'm not here just for

2083.119 --> 2087.52
flat earth

2084.079 --> 2090.079
i'm also here for me my development

2087.52 --> 2091.28
and to set an example to the outside

2090.079 --> 2094.159
world that

2091.28 --> 2094.639
yeah no matter what you think of me i

2094.159 --> 2098.0
can

2094.639 --> 2101.119
i have i am proving as i go along

2098.0 --> 2104.64
with my dedication that you can

2101.119 --> 2107.28
overcome psychological issues

2104.64 --> 2107.2799999999997
and how

2108.0 --> 2114.24
and how to understand the world

2111.44 --> 2117.839
that is an influence on you better in

2114.24 --> 2117.839
order to balance yourself

2118.56 --> 2126.16
and that's what i've been doing for

2123.04 --> 2129.2799999999997
four years and at the first i

2126.16 --> 2131.04
do just have you seen like my first

2129.28 --> 2132.6400000000003
just the entire flat earth talks but

2131.04 --> 2134.64
especially the first half

2132.64 --> 2137.52
i was so freaking insecure it's

2134.64 --> 2137.52
unbelievable

2139.44 --> 2145.68
i managed to hit hide that

2142.88 --> 2148.0
pretty decently if i say so myself for

2145.68 --> 2151.04
me i think i hit it pretty decently but

2148.0 --> 2153.359
man i can feel it from it

2151.04 --> 2153.359
you know

2154.96 --> 2159.839
but that's yeah those nerves

2160.16 --> 2163.2
have routed themselves they've they're

2162.88 --> 2167.04
like

2163.2 --> 2169.04
roots and they've dug in

2167.04 --> 2170.24
they now have a place they have a

2169.04 --> 2173.52
function

2170.24 --> 2176.72
those nerve energies have a reach

2173.52 --> 2181.04
they actually are part of something

2176.72 --> 2181.04
constructive that i utilize in the

2183.23 --> 2186.22
[Music]

2184.839 --> 2193.669
process

2186.22 --> 2193.669
[Music]

2194.64 --> 2200.16
is in psychology pseudo

2197.76 --> 2202.7200000000003
well only if you're going to say it's a

2200.16 --> 2202.72
science

2204.4 --> 2210.48
you know i think

2207.52 --> 2211.04
this may sound a little silly but i

2210.48 --> 2213.28
think it

2211.04 --> 2214.96
might just as well be classified under

2213.28 --> 2220.8
engineering

2214.96 --> 2220.8
it's simply simply mind engineering

2223.839 --> 2231.599
right because yeah

2227.76 --> 2234.1600000000003
people do utilize it now of course

2231.599 --> 2235.119
most people eventually the really good

2234.16 --> 2238.24
ones use

2235.119 --> 2240.079
their intuition and their own personal

2238.24 --> 2243.52
teachings

2240.079 --> 2246.4
not so much a playbook right because

2243.52 --> 2247.839
technically psychology sort of is that

2246.4 --> 2251.599
playbook

2247.839 --> 2253.92
but the real psychologist uses their own

2251.599 --> 2255.76
learnings and yeah their own backgrounds

2253.92 --> 2258.96
and their own intuitions

2255.76 --> 2258.96
and that's what it really is

2259.04 --> 2264.96
it's not really a science it's not like

2262.4 --> 2264.96
every year

2267.2 --> 2270.72
it's not one is all it's all separate

2270.24 --> 2275.1189999999997
it's

2270.72 --> 2276.8799999999997
yeah it's it's it's too fluid

2275.119 --> 2279.52
it can't really pinpoint it down all

2276.88 --> 2282.56
that well everybody's different

2279.52 --> 2286.16
so psychology is more like

2282.56 --> 2289.68
social engineering uh

2286.16 --> 2293.359
damn yeah you make a good point

2289.68 --> 2299.839
right social engineering i guess

2293.359 --> 2302.4
but on the individual level

2299.839 --> 2302.96
so but it's more like a discipline in a

2302.4 --> 2304.96
way

2302.96 --> 2306.7200000000003
it's it's not really a science in my

2304.96 --> 2309.04
opinion

2306.72 --> 2310.16
i i would classify it under engineering

2309.04 --> 2312.0
much more

2310.16 --> 2314.72
it doesn't mean that you can't [ __ ] up

2312.0 --> 2318.56
the engineering you can do it wrong

2314.72 --> 2320.7999999999997
but it is more like engineering

2318.56 --> 2320.7999999999997
you know

2321.839 --> 2341.839
it's just not metal

2327.359 --> 2341.839
metal and plastic and and all that

2346.96 --> 2354.96
right tom parker that's it it's a mirror

2350.48 --> 2359.2
because in the mirror of somebody else

2354.96 --> 2361.92
they can see everybody can see things

2359.2 --> 2363.68
in a unique spectrum and you don't know

2361.92 --> 2369.839
what you don't see

2363.68 --> 2369.839
until somebody else points it out

2371.52 --> 2376.8
so you can have a friend for that or you

2373.68 --> 2380.0
can have a trained psychologist

2376.8 --> 2384.2400000000002
or you can have a

2380.0 --> 2384.24
yeah more as a spirit person

2384.64 --> 2392.96
yeah which or medium or whatever

2388.72 --> 2395.52
it's about having your issues reflected

2392.96 --> 2398.56
by somebody else so you can see unique

2395.52 --> 2401.52
things explained to you that you

2398.56 --> 2402.0789999999997
cannot see on your own right oh if you

2401.52 --> 2403.68
trust

2402.079 --> 2407.04
if you have a good enough friend to

2403.68 --> 2407.04
trust then that's great

2408.8 --> 2411.8390000000004
you know

2414.35 --> 2420.86
[Music]

2428.88 --> 2433.599
a good servant no philosophy not so much

2432.0 --> 2436.88
because philosophy is

2433.599 --> 2436.88
purely theoretical

2437.76 --> 2444.5600000000004
it's purely conceptual psychology

2440.88 --> 2447.2000000000003
is actions it's influencing so it

2444.56 --> 2449.359
it's it's not pure it's not just

2447.2 --> 2453.839
philosophy

2449.359 --> 2453.839
there's interaction going on

2454.319 --> 2460.8
feelings insights

2457.599 --> 2462.2400000000002
opinions being changed

2460.8 --> 2465.04
so there's physically something

2462.24 --> 2466.4799999999996
happening it's not just ideas

2465.04 --> 2468.24
although these things naturally

2466.48 --> 2471.44
typically happen if you discuss

2468.24 --> 2472.9599999999996
philosophy but that's not what

2471.44 --> 2476.16
psychology is

2472.96 --> 2479.52
people go to be changed

2476.16 --> 2482.64
and then yeah that may occur

2479.52 --> 2486.72
thanks to psychology but also because

2482.64 --> 2489.52
they are open hopefully

2486.72 --> 2489.52
they try to be

2492.839 --> 2500.88
corollary coralie

2496.0 --> 2505.04
you mean it's

2500.88 --> 2505.04
coral lactory you mean i take it

2506.64 --> 2509.839
correlation based

2533.44 --> 2537.359
social engineering started exploiting

2535.599 --> 2539.52
human psychology right why it's

2537.359 --> 2541.7599999999998
programming

2539.52 --> 2546.079
that's really what the more official

2541.76 --> 2546.079
social engineering designation is for

2547.2 --> 2553.04
is it's all about statistics statistical

2550.64 --> 2555.5989999999997
responses and then like if you do this

2553.04 --> 2557.92
what will the influence be is that handy

2555.599 --> 2560.56
for what we have planned

2557.92 --> 2561.6800000000003
that's really what social engineering is

2560.56 --> 2564.0
now psychology

2561.68 --> 2565.9199999999996
is personal it's it's not social

2564.0 --> 2569.92
engineering although yeah if

2565.92 --> 2572.4
there is agendas whatever

2569.92 --> 2573.2000000000003
specific thing yeah psychology

2572.4 --> 2575.839
discipline

2573.2 --> 2577.52
or profession can be subject to social

2575.839 --> 2579.44
engineering as well

2577.52 --> 2582.0
and in the standard playbook that

2579.44 --> 2593.839
becomes very obvious but again

2582.0 --> 2593.839
not all psychologists do it like that

2593.89 --> 2597.06
[Music]

2598.56 --> 2607.839
trans personal psycho what

2609.2 --> 2615.04
grandiose and vulnerable forms of

2611.839 --> 2615.04
narcissism what

2615.28 --> 2617.44
i

2618.64 --> 2622.7999999999997
i don't know what you're talking about

2620.24 --> 2635.839
really but

2622.8 --> 2635.8390000000004
can you be more specific

2640.319 --> 2645.359
okay hmm

2646.839 --> 2651.8089999999997
okay

2648.04 --> 2651.8089999999997
[Music]

2652.16 --> 2656.48
sure well that could be interesting to

2654.319 --> 2658.8
to read into that

2656.48 --> 2663.839
because it's like a field study i can

2658.8 --> 2663.8390000000004
already feel that

2666.8 --> 2670.88
sounds interesting i don't know if i

2669.92 --> 2677.839
could really read

2670.88 --> 2677.839
through it though

2685.119 --> 2691.839
anyway uh

2693.359 --> 2695.68
huh

2696.48 --> 2704.16
okay pierce never really came back to me

2698.8 --> 2706.0
maybe he was just

2704.16 --> 2707.7599999999998
waiting for the play yeah some of these

2706.0 --> 2709.839
quarter trolls yeah

2707.76 --> 2711.92
nathan has collected a lot of squirted

2709.839 --> 2713.68
trolls for some reason it's not

2711.92 --> 2714.48
surprising though with the way that he

2713.68 --> 2717.1189999999997
spanx

2714.48 --> 2718.72
the globers and all that it really isn't

2717.119 --> 2721.28
surprising

2718.72 --> 2724.24
but i do notice a lot that they do tend

2721.28 --> 2724.2400000000002
to come in here

2724.8 --> 2729.119
as if they're like impatiently waiting

2727.119 --> 2732.7200000000003
and need to lash out before they

2729.119 --> 2747.839
really get into it watching the flat

2732.72 --> 2747.839
earth debates

2753.68 --> 2758.72
one world religion being the

2755.28 --> 2758.7200000000003
heliocentric religion

2758.839 --> 2766.0
no yes and no

2762.4 --> 2766.0
it's complicated

2771.2 --> 2775.839
i don't think that the one world

2773.359 --> 2775.839
religion

2776.079 --> 2780.5600000000004
is a covert religion which is what the

2778.64 --> 2783.92
globe really is

2780.56 --> 2787.2799999999997
right get it it's a covert religion

2783.92 --> 2790.319
it's occult it's not shared

2787.28 --> 2790.3190000000004
what you're believing

2790.4 --> 2796.8
and and that it's a belief

2793.44 --> 2799.52
that's what makes it so mind control-ish

2796.8 --> 2800.5600000000004
but i think that the one-world religion

2799.52 --> 2803.839
is more like an

2800.56 --> 2803.839
open religion

2811.04 --> 2817.68
but yeah technically again

2814.48 --> 2818.96
the globe is a religion it's it's just

2817.68 --> 2820.8799999999997
covert

2818.96 --> 2823.92
it's secret it's secret that it's a

2820.88 --> 2831.839
religion and turns everything inside out

2823.92 --> 2831.839
in order to conceal that

2839.76 --> 2842.88
oh dare i have to fantasize about

2842.079 --> 2847.92
everybody getting

2842.88 --> 2847.92
murdered again is that so necessary

2848.0 --> 2859.839
oh god

2870.839 --> 2873.839
so

2880.24 --> 2884.9599999999996
i don't know man guys have you ever

2881.76 --> 2888.4
thought about that maybe just this

2884.96 --> 2891.599
murder depopulation idea

2888.4 --> 2891.599
might have always been

2891.76 --> 2895.599
kind of like an idea placement to just

2894.24 --> 2897.839
make it worse

2895.599 --> 2900.1600000000003
because i think that they just want to

2897.839 --> 2902.4
depopulate everybody by just

2900.16 --> 2904.16
[ __ ] everybody up so bad in their

2902.4 --> 2905.92
minds that they'll just want to end it

2904.16 --> 2906.5589999999997
that they'll just be convinced it's

2905.92 --> 2909.52
better to

2906.559 --> 2911.119
go everyone i think that is more what

2909.52 --> 2912.88
they want

2911.119 --> 2915.04
i don't think they're gonna just

2912.88 --> 2916.2400000000002
slaughter a bunch of people like that

2915.04 --> 2918.319
i don't think they're gonna do that

2916.24 --> 2921.7599999999998
anymore

2918.319 --> 2921.7599999999998
maybe not ever i don't know

2923.52 --> 2929.119
you know i think that maybe the georgia

2926.8 --> 2932.48
guidestones could could be

2929.119 --> 2935.6800000000003
could be put on the level of

2932.48 --> 2939.359
like ufo abductions

2935.68 --> 2941.52
like the ideas were put out there

2939.359 --> 2943.04
that that's going on in order to make

2941.52 --> 2946.48
people think about

2943.04 --> 2949.2799999999997
this universe as a standard in order to

2946.48 --> 2951.04
conceptualize these actions happening

2949.28 --> 2952.8
right well what if the georgia guide

2951.04 --> 2957.2
zones were basically put there to

2952.8 --> 2960.48
bring out the idea that there is a giant

2957.2 --> 2963.52
elitish satanic conspiracy to

2960.48 --> 2966.8
murder everyone

2963.52 --> 2969.599
when maybe that's just actually

2966.8 --> 2971.44
not entirely true but it is important

2969.599 --> 2974.8
for them as a mind control

2971.44 --> 2977.44
scheme that a lot of people do think it

2974.8 --> 2980.319
so that they will eventually extinguish

2977.44 --> 2980.319
themselves

2982.839 --> 2989.68
um

2984.72 --> 2989.68
yeah placebo effect weaponized exactly

2991.92 --> 3000.8
and are we not seeing this

2996.839 --> 3000.7999999999997
exactly the muzzles

3001.599 --> 3013.839
defending your own slavery well that's

3004.96 --> 3013.839
what that is

3016.72 --> 3022.8799999999997
nobody thinks that deeply

3020.079 --> 3023.44
well that's because they got distracted

3022.88 --> 3026.559
huh

3023.44 --> 3027.2000000000003
huh got distracted so many distractions

3026.559 --> 3030.0
if it's not

3027.2 --> 3032.48
out here on the internet the pop-up the

3030.0 --> 3034.96
next video suggestion

3032.48 --> 3036.64
rebuttal a troll comment then it's

3034.96 --> 3038.16
things in your head that you're

3036.64 --> 3041.52
reflecting upon

3038.16 --> 3045.7599999999998
so many distractions all you need

3041.52 --> 3049.359
is to find some clarity

3045.76 --> 3051.6800000000003
and you'll see it that's the way

3049.359 --> 3054.0789999999997
through it's what i'm talking about i

3051.68 --> 3057.1189999999997
just see this sort of thing

3054.079 --> 3059.44
and i don't it to me it's like oh hey

3057.119 --> 3062.559
i can see it like that let me put it out

3059.44 --> 3065.76
there it doesn't mean that oh my god

3062.559 --> 3067.2000000000003
this means everything changes no it's a

3065.76 --> 3069.44
conception

3067.2 --> 3074.16
and it's a good conception and because i

3069.44 --> 3074.16
don't put so insanely much weight to it

3074.72 --> 3078.7999999999997
i can put it out there without

3076.0 --> 3078.8
distorting it

3081.599 --> 3085.839
because it could be real

3086.48 --> 3090.2400000000002
it could also be

3091.04 --> 3095.04
a quantum reality maybe what if that is

3094.4 --> 3098.1600000000003
what they

3095.04 --> 3100.319
want the what i

3098.16 --> 3102.0
explained people basically doing it

3100.319 --> 3105.599
themselves but they might

3102.0 --> 3106.4
in the end be forced for some mysterious

3105.599 --> 3108.7200000000003
reason

3106.4 --> 3109.76
to really do that maybe there's

3108.72 --> 3114.16
something really

3109.76 --> 3116.6400000000003
messed up creepy going on like maybe

3114.16 --> 3117.68
i don't know the the little g gods out

3116.64 --> 3120.319
there

3117.68 --> 3121.68
have set like this standard like you

3120.319 --> 3124.16
like maybe they

3121.68 --> 3125.1189999999997
commanded like the devils you could say

3124.16 --> 3128.72
the pantheon

3125.119 --> 3128.7200000000003
the non-big g god

3129.599 --> 3137.04
right you could see it all kinds of ways

3133.92 --> 3140.4
you don't know until it's happening

3137.04 --> 3142.64
but if you look at how much mind control

3140.4 --> 3144.96
is influencing things then yeah

3142.64 --> 3146.64
couldn't it be conceived since this is

3144.96 --> 3148.559
also a long plan that the georgia

3146.64 --> 3152.4
guidestones could just as well be there

3148.559 --> 3155.76
purely to put out the suggestion

3152.4 --> 3158.96
that that is going on to bosom

3155.76 --> 3158.96
fear in the people

3159.76 --> 3165.119
in order for them to not grow as much to

3163.839 --> 3168.24
be more defensive

3165.119 --> 3172.96
and maybe even drive themselves

3168.24 --> 3175.04
nuts or become more more predatory

3172.96 --> 3176.4
towards others because they distrust

3175.04 --> 3177.2799999999997
them because they think they might be

3176.4 --> 3180.319
part of that

3177.28 --> 3181.92
see and effectively you almost become

3180.319 --> 3185.2
part of that when you

3181.92 --> 3187.44
change your demeanor that much

3185.2 --> 3188.319
you play into it whether it's real or

3187.44 --> 3190.559
not

3188.319 --> 3190.5589999999997
see

3191.44 --> 3197.359
that's mind control suggestion based

3194.72 --> 3197.359
mind control

3199.839 --> 3202.48
it's working

3202.88 --> 3207.6800000000003
everybody knows about it everybody knows

3204.96 --> 3210.64
about the stones now

3207.68 --> 3213.1189999999997
right the entire conspiracy world knows

3210.64 --> 3213.1189999999997
about these

3220.839 --> 3223.839
so

3231.92 --> 3238.64
but then again who knows yeah again

3236.079 --> 3239.3590000000004
it could be a quantum situation either

3238.64 --> 3240.7999999999997
they don't

3239.359 --> 3242.72
want to do it and they'll do it like

3240.8 --> 3244.8
this but eventually they might do it if

3242.72 --> 3247.4399999999996
it turns out not to work and it'll be a

3244.8 --> 3248.8390000000004
like a hot war situation terrible

3247.44 --> 3251.92
genocides

3248.839 --> 3253.68
or they never really wanted to do this

3251.92 --> 3254.64
and this is just their little devil

3253.68 --> 3258.0789999999997
scheme to fool

3254.64 --> 3260.5589999999997
everybody into becoming a failure see

3258.079 --> 3264.2400000000002
it could be either one it's a quantum

3260.559 --> 3268.8
reality potentially

3264.24 --> 3268.7999999999997
you don't know until it happens

3269.2 --> 3272.319
and yeah it could be even so quantum

3271.839 --> 3274.48
that

3272.319 --> 3276.079
they can that it's like a flip of the

3274.48 --> 3278.079
coin

3276.079 --> 3280.079
it's balancing and at some point it may

3278.079 --> 3281.92
fall to one side

3280.079 --> 3284.079
that they haven't decided yet and

3281.92 --> 3285.599
they're just per default going by one

3284.079 --> 3286.559
because that's what it's been programmed

3285.599 --> 3290.839
see

3286.559 --> 3293.8390000000004
complicated social engineering

3290.839 --> 3293.839
complicated

3298.24 --> 3304.0789999999997
ah we are up for a major decrease

3308.16 --> 3311.92
well the biggest problem in my personal

3310.079 --> 3314.7200000000003
opinion is not even that

3311.92 --> 3317.28
the population is not breeding as much

3314.72 --> 3317.2799999999997
is that

3317.76 --> 3321.76
so many now are poisoning themselves by

3320.4 --> 3325.2000000000003
default the amount

3321.76 --> 3327.559
of toxified people

3325.2 --> 3328.799
versus non-toxified people has

3327.559 --> 3332.8390000000004
dramatically

3328.799 --> 3335.28
increased in the last two

3332.839 --> 3338.48
decades

3335.28 --> 3340.079
there's so many more toxic medicines out

3338.48 --> 3344.64
there and just garbage

3340.079 --> 3344.6400000000003
in food snuck in there

3346.48 --> 3352.559
and i think that that on the long run is

3348.72 --> 3352.5589999999997
probably even more problematic

3357.44 --> 3363.119
because yeah minds change you know

3360.96 --> 3364.559
in a certain way you're like oh no i'm

3363.119 --> 3365.92
never going to do that and then at some

3364.559 --> 3368.079
point i mean like holy [ __ ] what i've

3365.92 --> 3370.7200000000003
been doing no i do want to do that

3368.079 --> 3371.3590000000004
i do want to get kids and all that just

3370.72 --> 3374.799
look

3371.359 --> 3376.64
hello me in a way

3374.799 --> 3378.64
now the weird thing is i always wanted

3376.64 --> 3381.2799999999997
kids but i never really

3378.64 --> 3382.0789999999997
dared it i thought that was incompetent

3381.28 --> 3384.48
yeah it's

3382.079 --> 3386.7200000000003
pretty harsh to feel that about yourself

3384.48 --> 3386.72
now

3388.079 --> 3392.96
i feel that i could and i'm just like oh

3391.839 --> 3395.599
no as

3392.96 --> 3396.16
don't let time slip me by for too long

3395.599 --> 3400.4
because

3396.16 --> 3402.16
i might get too old or something and

3400.4 --> 3404.799
right but it's different because i think

3402.16 --> 3405.5989999999997
i can handle it even though i'd realize

3404.799 --> 3407.92
that

3405.599 --> 3409.52
if it's gonna be my kid that mean it's

3407.92 --> 3411.599
gonna potentially be

3409.52 --> 3412.96
problematically intelligent and i'm

3411.599 --> 3416.319
gonna have to face a

3412.96 --> 3418.48
massive challenge like a spiritual

3416.319 --> 3420.319
challenge that's

3418.48 --> 3424.559
that i really would not be able to

3420.319 --> 3424.5589999999997
compare to anything else out there

3430.839 --> 3436.24
so

3433.68 --> 3437.2799999999997
but yeah we'll i'll get there when i'll

3436.24 --> 3446.9599999999996
get there

3437.28 --> 3449.119
gotta get a girlfriend first

3446.96 --> 3450.559
all right i think i'm going to round out

3449.119 --> 3461.839
the shows has been very

3450.559 --> 3461.8390000000004
psychological today
