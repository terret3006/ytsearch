can always use the

109.28 --> 114.28
support

110.84 --> 116.43900000000001
right so weather today

114.28 --> 121.32000000000001
again

116.439 --> 123.439
is kind of a gray soup

121.32 --> 127.08
it's a bit less

123.439 --> 131.35999999999999
wind it's a bit calmer which is kind of

127.08 --> 131.35999999999999
nice getting kind of sick of all the

132.28 --> 135.28
wind

136.72 --> 140.64
so no rain or

142.4 --> 148.4
anything my rosemary plant is just still

145.44 --> 148.4
crushing it right

148.76 --> 151.76
away

154.519 --> 162.59900000000002
I'll show you up close I mean it's like

159.56 --> 162.599
it doesn't

167.68 --> 175.4
care it's just doing

172.4 --> 175.4
great

176.2 --> 181.76
see get in front of that for the

178.76 --> 181.76
contrast

182.319 --> 187.35999999999999
see it's like doing absolutely

193.799 --> 199.239
fine doesn't even have that like it had

197.28 --> 201.44
more brown leaves and all that during

199.239 --> 201.44
the

202.72 --> 207.72
summer then it has while it was snowing

205.68 --> 211.68
and

207.72 --> 211.68
everything right so it's doing great

226.0 --> 229.64
hey Amanda young first in chat good to

228.4 --> 234.31900000000002
see

229.64 --> 234.319
you it's raining in New York oh

238.68 --> 241.68
okay

245.76 --> 252.67999999999998
right it is Thursday the 25th of January

255.28 --> 260.639
2024 temperatures 8° C

263.24 --> 268.6
right but I mean I do kind of like this

265.639 --> 273.68
WEA I I did like

268.6 --> 273.68
the all the Sun a bit more

276.16 --> 279.28000000000003
though the

280.28 --> 286.63899999999995
sunl I miss it a bit with all this

283.24 --> 290.12
cloudiness all day

286.639 --> 292.0
long but I mean it might be back in like

290.12 --> 294.32
two days or something according to this

292.0 --> 294.32
weather

294.8 --> 298.32
forecast I'm looking

298.56 --> 301.56
at

301.68 --> 304.68
right

304.919 --> 308.68
so how's everybody

308.919 --> 314.479
doing I got an Illuminati croissant

311.88 --> 314.479
still in the

315.199 --> 319.16
oven and the coffee on the

321.6 --> 324.6
standby

328.479 --> 332.4
uh

330.039 --> 332.4
let's

352.039 --> 356.0
see Hello Brian

358.479 --> 363.12
Johnson what is I doing yesterday oh

376.0 --> 382.479
yeah right show yesterday was great

379.88 --> 382.479
thought it was

384.28 --> 390.35999999999996
great certainly got an amount of views

387.0 --> 393.96
not as much as the holy trebuchet

390.36 --> 396.44
episode though which is now at 613 views

393.96 --> 399.19899999999996
I haven't had that many in a

396.44 --> 401.56
while really attracted the attention I

399.199 --> 404.12
did actually like look started looking

401.56 --> 407.16
into like videos about Tre

404.12 --> 408.599
uses very interesting like mathematical

407.16 --> 413.36
design and all

408.599 --> 417.0
that but also quite Limited in

413.36 --> 421.47900000000004
its in the arc it can throw

417.0 --> 424.68
so it might like in a literal

421.479 --> 429.87899999999996
sense might not be entirely

424.68 --> 429.879
useful but maybe if they had like

430.56 --> 438.879
a an extra powered

433.44 --> 441.36
one like a trebet that is like has extra

438.879 --> 443.91900000000004
power because of I don't know a steam

441.36 --> 443.91900000000004
engine or

444.599 --> 449.87899999999996
something that kind of forces a lot of

448.599 --> 454.199
extra power

449.879 --> 458.12
onto it somehow like a steel one I don't

454.199 --> 461.68
know but yeah they don't have this

458.12 --> 461.68
massive launch

462.0 --> 467.199
capacity distance wise like they can

464.52 --> 470.44
throw very far very distant but they are

467.199 --> 470.44
very big in relation

472.44 --> 477.28
also but still like not

477.36 --> 484.44
miles that's kind of the problem

480.759 --> 487.47900000000004
for an entire conception of like oh

484.44 --> 489.52
meteors I mean a Canon might work but I

487.479 --> 493.75899999999996
mean

489.52 --> 495.35999999999996
yeah you hear those obviously and if

493.759 --> 499.52000000000004
you're going to go to like maybe a

495.36 --> 499.52000000000004
magnetic launching device oh

499.56 --> 505.28000000000003
really well that would certainly be very

503.4 --> 507.79999999999995
conspiratorial then at that point

505.28 --> 511.23999999999995
because that is technology that's just

507.8 --> 511.24
very unlikely to have been

511.519 --> 515.0
mastered that long

516.959 --> 521.3599999999999
ago anyhow hello

538.2 --> 541.2
Tommy

541.839 --> 548.32
right also mun keeps nagging at me he

545.56 --> 549.079
wants to come on with me but I know he

548.32 --> 552.0
like

549.079 --> 554.64
it's he's just going to be a smiling

552.0 --> 557.56
bully basically I I don't trust that guy

554.64 --> 559.88
at all like I don't think I could I get

557.56 --> 563.7199999999999
something productive out of this I maybe

559.88 --> 566.36
now that I've sort of separated from

563.72 --> 571.12
Nathan he thinks like oh maybe I can be

566.36 --> 574.48
that guy screw you dude

571.12 --> 577.68
no I don't know I I don't really like

574.48 --> 577.6800000000001
mun that

578.6 --> 583.88
much I mean I love pointing at him and

581.32 --> 588.0400000000001
laughing at times when he starts double

583.88 --> 588.04
speaking on one of his shows

589.32 --> 594.0
but I don't really want to like do

592.56 --> 596.1199999999999
anything to get because I don't just

594.0 --> 601.64
don't feel like oh I'm going to try to

596.12 --> 601.64
trick you like no just just Let It

604.36 --> 609.12
Go think of the

606.55 --> 611.76
[Music]

609.12 --> 614.839
views to amount to

611.76 --> 619.399
what those views aren't going to

614.839 --> 619.399
stay it's just mostly a bunch of

619.839 --> 626.9200000000001
trolls yeah with those views also comes

623.079 --> 631.04
massive amount of spam and

626.92 --> 631.04
nagging do I really want those

636.279 --> 642.16
views you think any of those new views

638.8 --> 645.8
are going to support

642.16 --> 649.16
me I highly doubt

645.8 --> 650.7199999999999
it and the extra ad Revenue isn't really

649.16 --> 653.12
going to make that much of a difference

650.72 --> 653.12
either

653.24 --> 658.04
so now I want C I want quality crowd I

656.72 --> 659.839
want

658.04 --> 663.24
people

659.839 --> 666.2790000000001
that don't even have a group out there

663.24 --> 668.88
that they belong to

666.279 --> 671.279
because well then they during their

668.88 --> 673.16
lifetime they've discovered yeah they're

671.279 --> 676.16
all

673.16 --> 678.8
[ __ ] like especially the ones that

676.16 --> 682.56
think they're really

678.8 --> 684.56
smart and and use that in like

682.56 --> 686.88
group

684.56 --> 688.56
dynamics like oh we're the Smart Ones

686.88 --> 690.959
yeah they're really stupid and there's a

688.56 --> 690.959
lot of them

692.2 --> 697.0400000000001
and yeah hopefully those individuals

694.16 --> 699.079
will like bump into me and just be

697.04 --> 701.399
genuinely interesting and and realize

699.079 --> 704.7199999999999
like yeah that's actually a guy that's

701.399 --> 707.8
really honestly just there and available

704.72 --> 711.36
almost like a private tutor in

707.8 --> 713.88
public is that's kind of what I intend

711.36 --> 716.72
to be and you know there's a lot of

713.88 --> 718.639
trolling and hey I'm not always optimal

716.72 --> 720.76
right I'm a guy I have my own issues

718.639 --> 723.76
sometimes

720.76 --> 726.8389999999999
but I hope to collect those types of

723.76 --> 729.76
individuals the individuals that are

726.839 --> 733.1600000000001
really not incapable of being part of

729.76 --> 735.519
groups but that have just like learned

733.16 --> 739.079
that it's dangerous to become part of a

735.519 --> 741.279
group to become part of a hive mind

739.079 --> 742.76
because it makes you do things that you

741.279 --> 745.72
actually don't want to

742.76 --> 747.079
do and if you're like that this is the

745.72 --> 750.48
place for

747.079 --> 752.7199999999999
you this is the place where you're not

750.48 --> 756.399
peer pressured to do anything rather

752.72 --> 761.72
you're peer pressured to not do

756.399 --> 763.24
things like spaz out or give lip in a

761.72 --> 767.0790000000001
tense

763.24 --> 770.04
moment just really

767.079 --> 775.3599999999999
rudimentary almost like the feel of

770.04 --> 775.36
common law type social

776.56 --> 780.8389999999999
standards right

781.079 --> 785.399
and you can act as an individual still

783.12 --> 785.399
be

786.68 --> 792.16
yourself but you got to be behav you got

789.399 --> 794.079
to be your best and that's what I like

792.16 --> 795.519
here and I like and if you have a lot of

794.079 --> 798.959
these individuals that are all

795.519 --> 802.92
individual like we're all individuals

798.959 --> 806.6389999999999
yes yes we are right that's

802.92 --> 809.079
funny but what if it's real it's like a

806.639 --> 812.76
collective of individuals that don't

809.079 --> 817.8389999999999
don't behave collectively except with

812.76 --> 821.0
the on the common law level like common

817.839 --> 823.1600000000001
decency gentlemanliness these kinds of

821.0 --> 826.48
basic

823.16 --> 826.48
things but

826.56 --> 832.0
also just the art of Confrontation is

830.24 --> 834.639
something that of course I do and I am

832.0 --> 838.44
very overt about it on my show because I

834.639 --> 840.32
am the show host so I'm very confronting

838.44 --> 843.48
some times

840.32 --> 845.839
like it wouldn't be reasonable just as a

843.48 --> 848.16
person to really do it to that level

845.839 --> 851.5600000000001
with other people I do it as the show

848.16 --> 853.4399999999999
host it's like that's where I force

851.56 --> 856.04
things to go

853.44 --> 858.519
moving and some people are like very

856.04 --> 860.24
scared of that because they feel like oh

858.519 --> 862.92
my God I'm being so exposed with all

860.24 --> 867.519
this honesty and makes me feel kind of

862.92 --> 867.519
fragile makes me not feel cool or

867.68 --> 871.6389999999999
whatever

869.36 --> 873.279
but those people usually just don't

871.639 --> 875.72
really work on themselves that much

873.279 --> 880.279
they're just more concerned about is the

875.72 --> 882.6800000000001
fer of my Persona looking good enough

880.279 --> 885.519
they don't care about working on

882.68 --> 890.5999999999999
themselves they just want to find some

885.519 --> 893.24
pile to be the top of basically

890.6 --> 896.0790000000001
metaphysically right like all those

893.24 --> 898.399
followers on of mun and Sim and Dan they

896.079 --> 900.959
want to be part of a pile they don't

898.399 --> 903.88
want to work on themselves they don't

900.959 --> 903.88
want to test their

904.0 --> 907.36
beliefs I don't need those people

906.16 --> 908.959
there's a lot of them and they're

907.36 --> 912.16
completely

908.959 --> 912.16
useless and

914.68 --> 920.959
annoying I want quality people that have

917.56 --> 924.04
insights that are cheeky that want to

920.959 --> 926.8
like I'm not sure about that Arwin but

924.04 --> 927.5999999999999
that'll hold their freaking tongue until

926.8 --> 931.7589999999999
they

927.6 --> 934.0790000000001
know with certainty that I was indeed

931.759 --> 936.6800000000001
mistaken about

934.079 --> 940.04
something and then as a neutral

936.68 --> 940.04
correction just correct

940.279 --> 946.16
it like I do too like if somebody says

944.24 --> 948.72
something with a spelling error I

946.16 --> 951.04
usually like correct it or do it with a

948.72 --> 951.0400000000001
bit of

951.399 --> 956.0
fun but unless you continually do that

954.44 --> 957.5600000000001
and continually stumble with your

956.0 --> 960.04
wording I'm not going to make you like

957.56 --> 962.279
look like a clown for it right but I

960.04 --> 964.12
will point it out if you're doing that

962.279 --> 966.72
it's like hey you're getting

964.12 --> 971.16
sloppy pay attention to what you write

966.72 --> 971.1600000000001
down double check before you press

972.88 --> 980.24
enter concentrate

976.36 --> 983.8000000000001
anyway so like the opposite of the board

980.24 --> 983.8
yes hello clutch good to see

987.519 --> 991.68
you

989.04 --> 994.759
the mods can keep order and kick out

991.68 --> 998.8
anyone making

994.759 --> 1002.279
aggro no now the mods can't really do

998.8 --> 1005.639
that here at all mods a very

1002.279 --> 1009.04
limited like power to do that but that's

1005.639 --> 1012.72
because I as the show host am directly

1009.04 --> 1012.7199999999999
engaged with the chat so I'm

1013.56 --> 1019.88
taking like Imperial power I'm doing it

1017.44 --> 1022.6800000000001
like the emper like like no

1019.88 --> 1026.439
I'll I'll determine

1022.68 --> 1028.72
that unless it's like too much unless

1026.439 --> 1032.6000000000001
like the really like multiple people are

1028.72 --> 1035.4
spamming and [ __ ] and then or if I'm

1032.6 --> 1037.12
like talking in a deep thought that's

1035.4 --> 1039.1200000000001
lasting and they're doing it while I'm

1037.12 --> 1041.8799999999999
doing that and it's going to make a mess

1039.12 --> 1044.6
somebody then like as a security check

1041.88 --> 1048.88
like oh nope you're a

1044.6 --> 1052.4399999999998
spammer that's good but I mean the day

1048.88 --> 1056.72
of like oh I'm in in the chat I have a

1052.44 --> 1059.1200000000001
wrench I don't like your beliefs or what

1056.72 --> 1061.3600000000001
you're saying what you're professing so

1059.12 --> 1063.1999999999998
I'm going to kick you or I'm going to

1061.36 --> 1065.039
time you out every time you say anything

1063.2 --> 1068.88
like those days are

1065.039 --> 1068.8799999999999
over doesn't work like

1070.799 --> 1076.24
that I mean if somebody is directly at

1074.559 --> 1079.1589999999999
Haring

1076.24 --> 1082.52
you and you have a wrench

1079.159 --> 1085.44
then you can like slap him can give him

1082.52 --> 1087.32
a timeout or delete the message however

1085.44 --> 1089.559
you like it and if they keep nagging

1087.32 --> 1093.2
then eventually it'll catch my attention

1089.559 --> 1095.039
and I will kick them out for you

1093.2 --> 1098.32
probably

1095.039 --> 1100.919
right but I mean yeah three years ago

1098.32 --> 1102.76
even it was almost like a game just like

1100.919 --> 1105.44
kick everybody out all the trolls kick

1102.76 --> 1110.32
them out everybody would just start wack

1105.44 --> 1110.3200000000002
playing wack-a-mole in the chat but

1110.88 --> 1115.64
that turns out not to really work on the

1113.24 --> 1118.28
long run because it just makes the

1115.64 --> 1122.0
trolls really enthusiastic and create a

1118.28 --> 1122.0
lot of sock accounts and keep doing

1122.08 --> 1126.6
that it's like you got to whack

1126.72 --> 1133.2
him but you got to Whack Him in the

1129.28 --> 1135.2
heart not on the physical being right

1133.2 --> 1137.799
you got to whack that Mo in the heart

1135.2 --> 1140.2
it's like instead of like playing whacko

1137.799 --> 1142.44
instead of just whacking them you look

1140.2 --> 1144.28
at them and you really get to them and

1142.44 --> 1146.72
then the mo

1144.28 --> 1150.24
goes and he goes down he doesn't come

1146.72 --> 1153.159
back up that's what we needed to do and

1150.24 --> 1153.159
that's how we do it

1161.919 --> 1167.2
now right because whacking him just

1164.679 --> 1167.2
doesn't get

1167.24 --> 1174.919
him

1169.919 --> 1174.919
you got to get to them to make them

1176.0 --> 1181.76
stop like if they're going to be

1178.32 --> 1184.28
spamming sock accounts then demoralize

1181.76 --> 1187.6
them first so they

1184.28 --> 1190.2
lose that enthusiasm energy that

1187.6 --> 1192.1999999999998
actually drives the process of them

1190.2 --> 1195.039
manically creating new sock accounts to

1192.2 --> 1198.4
keep doing it like if they feel they're

1195.039 --> 1200.76
winning then they'll never stop but if

1198.4 --> 1203.0
they just felt they lost something it

1200.76 --> 1205.48
hurts gets

1203.0 --> 1208.0
personal they actually feel the loser

1205.48 --> 1211.039
they are then that energy starts to

1208.0 --> 1212.72
decrease and they and they stop doing it

1211.039 --> 1215.32
because they got demoralized

1212.72 --> 1221.48
demoralizing a troll is very

1215.32 --> 1221.48
difficult because they are experts at

1221.88 --> 1227.48
demoralizing so it's very tough to outdo

1224.64 --> 1231.3600000000001
the expert you got to get them where

1227.48 --> 1235.159
they where you know they can't

1231.36 --> 1236.6399999999999
go cuz why is somebody a troll yeah

1235.159 --> 1238.5200000000002
that's what you got to figure out if you

1236.64 --> 1241.2800000000002
figure out why somebody's a troll then

1238.52 --> 1241.28
you can get to

1245.159 --> 1250.679
him cuz if you know why then you know

1249.12 --> 1252.1999999999998
something about why they're doing what

1250.679 --> 1255.21
they're

1252.2 --> 1257.1200000000001
doing you know what drives

1255.21 --> 1260.3600000000001
[Music]

1257.12 --> 1263.28
them and that it is very likely an

1260.36 --> 1266.1589999999999
Escapist behavior of a dissatisfaction

1263.28 --> 1268.32
with their own lives they're dissatis by

1266.159 --> 1270.4
people troll because usually they are

1268.32 --> 1272.8799999999999
dissatisfied about

1270.4 --> 1276.1200000000001
something in their own

1272.88 --> 1279.88
lives and they need to act out but they

1276.12 --> 1282.12
don't do it face to face nagging

1279.88 --> 1285.919
whatever spouse or

1282.12 --> 1289.0
something or a colleague they do it on

1285.919 --> 1291.0
the internet now

1289.0 --> 1294.679
but it is a dissatisfaction it's like

1291.0 --> 1297.52
with all bullies it's dissatisfaction in

1294.679 --> 1299.8400000000001
themselves that makes them do that

1297.52 --> 1302.0
they're projecting right it's always

1299.84 --> 1303.6399999999999
that it's always the damn projections

1302.0 --> 1306.12
every

1303.64 --> 1308.8400000000001
time and with a lot of trolls you can

1306.12 --> 1312.559
even Define exactly to what level that

1308.84 --> 1315.9599999999998
projection is by where they go with

1312.559 --> 1318.08
their accusatory assumptions about you

1315.96 --> 1321.4
it's like if they go really gross about

1318.08 --> 1323.12
about gay stuff details and sex then you

1321.4 --> 1325.24
know that they are a bunch of [ __ ]

1323.12 --> 1327.9189999999999
[ __ ] that

1325.24 --> 1332.679
are projecting

1327.919 --> 1332.679
that that's how I trigger

1333.08 --> 1339.96
them so you just can immediately

1335.679 --> 1344.24
identify somebody's sins by what and how

1339.96 --> 1344.24
they say things as a

1346.96 --> 1349.96
troll

1352.679 --> 1360.159
right anyhow so yeah I'm not looking for

1356.32 --> 1360.1589999999999
mun's crowd not

1364.679 --> 1371.52
really but maybe mun's got to got a

1368.159 --> 1373.8400000000001
couple of people that are looking

1371.52 --> 1377.32
for proper

1373.84 --> 1379.9189999999999
psychological interesting channels and

1377.32 --> 1382.0
studies and and want to hang around

1379.919 --> 1385.1200000000001
people that know about that and are

1382.0 --> 1385.12
willing to teach about

1387.12 --> 1391.7199999999998
it those people are certainly welcome

1394.48 --> 1399.1200000000001
here hey Dusty Flint gravel

1401.2 --> 1406.88
sporn what if they are children who have

1404.36 --> 1409.4799999999998
not been adequately

1406.88 --> 1412.919
punished well

1409.48 --> 1414.84
then if you don't if your parents don't

1412.919 --> 1418.039
punish you for bad behavior then the

1414.84 --> 1419.1589999999999
world will and it's often why they even

1418.039 --> 1420.76
do

1419.159 --> 1423.4
it I

1420.76 --> 1425.279
mean I've bet a lot of these freaks that

1423.4 --> 1427.3600000000001
just come after me and just want to see

1425.279 --> 1432.559
me rage win and

1427.36 --> 1435.3999999999999
whip describe about like brutal viseral

1432.559 --> 1437.559
punishments and all that they secretly

1435.4 --> 1439.8400000000001
want it because their parents didn't

1437.559 --> 1443.32
give a [ __ ] and all they wanted was to

1439.84 --> 1448.32
like why won't you put me straight I'm

1443.32 --> 1451.08
astray dad why don't you make me stop

1448.32 --> 1453.6789999999999
Dad this is a serious problem especially

1451.08 --> 1456.9189999999999
in the west there's a lot of like very

1453.679 --> 1456.919
cuy parents out

1457.159 --> 1462.0
there that are like terrified to correct

1460.039 --> 1465.24
their own children and it leads to a

1462.0 --> 1465.24
giant giant

1466.799 --> 1469.799
mess

1473.76 --> 1478.52
right and even I had a bit of issues

1476.0 --> 1480.919
with that with my own parents sometimes

1478.52 --> 1483.9189999999999
it's like I wish they would have been a

1480.919 --> 1485.679
bit more Resolute because I would like

1483.919 --> 1488.2
manipulate my way out of them and they

1485.679 --> 1492.1200000000001
couldn't handle it and I was really sad

1488.2 --> 1494.32
about it cuz I wanted to like no I'm

1492.12 --> 1496.2399999999998
doing something bad you can't let me

1494.32 --> 1500.12
overpower you right now you got to take

1496.24 --> 1502.679
control back over me me they wouldn't do

1500.12 --> 1506.1999999999998
it I was too

1502.679 --> 1510.8400000000001
strong in a psychological

1506.2 --> 1510.8400000000001
way and that made me feel

1510.919 --> 1518.3990000000001
sad as a teen I had these issues

1514.039 --> 1518.399
especially as a teenager right

1521.44 --> 1529.679
but

1523.039 --> 1529.679

he's like a compulsively manipulative

1690.08 --> 1696.36
person he's kind of a sociopath in in in

1693.24 --> 1698.96
a specific way

1696.36 --> 1701.1589999999999
it's like I don't even think he like

1698.96 --> 1704.44
objects to that when you say

1701.159 --> 1709.44
it he's he's he's a weird

1704.44 --> 1709.44
one he's one of those people

1713.039 --> 1718.919
conscious the those people is is one of

1716.519 --> 1722.3990000000001
those people another one of those

1718.919 --> 1725.919
like you know like all these really

1722.399 --> 1730.8799999999999
prominent anti flat earthers are one of

1725.919 --> 1730.88
those people like they all are like

1730.96 --> 1740.159
that they're like Grabbers with

1734.799 --> 1742.6
like with virtual currency of winning an

1740.159 --> 1745.3200000000002
argument they're like the Grabbers of

1742.6 --> 1747.559
the virtual currency of winning an

1745.32 --> 1750.72
argument and they're like always

1747.559 --> 1752.76
obsessed with that like whatever they do

1750.72 --> 1754.0
with the flat earther they even if

1752.76 --> 1756.2
they're going to talk about something

1754.0 --> 1759.24
else they want to prove that the flat

1756.2 --> 1762.0800000000002
earther is actually dumber than they

1759.24 --> 1764.159
pretend to be and they'll just do

1762.08 --> 1767.72
something ask some quick question

1764.159 --> 1770.88
casually like they just want to hum at

1767.72 --> 1774.44
flat earthers they're obsessed with

1770.88 --> 1777.279
it obsessed they can't help

1774.44 --> 1780.8400000000001
them like and people like Akuma virus

1777.279 --> 1782.279
are not like that CU he's just a guy who

1780.84 --> 1785.36
happens to be

1782.279 --> 1786.84
barded he's not obsessed he's not a

1785.36 --> 1790.4799999999998
grabbler

1786.84 --> 1793.279
with the virtual winning

1790.48 --> 1795.519
currency he's not obsessed with that he

1793.279 --> 1797.679
just wants to be able to think of the

1795.519 --> 1799.1200000000001
Earth as a ball and will use his

1797.679 --> 1802.88
intelligence

1799.12 --> 1806.12
to adapt however he needs to accomplish

1802.88 --> 1808.0
that and visualization for himself yeah

1806.12 --> 1810.36
that's very

1808.0 --> 1812.32
different from what these anti flat

1810.36 --> 1814.399
earthers that are with their channels

1812.32 --> 1819.12
are

1814.399 --> 1821.4799999999998
doing they want to have it like as a

1819.12 --> 1823.9599999999998
permanent establishment that flat

1821.48 --> 1829.039
earthers are

1823.96 --> 1831.72
dumber and delusional about everything

1829.039 --> 1834.1589999999999
and mun is is like a really prominent

1831.72 --> 1838.679
example of that so is flatter Earth of

1834.159 --> 1840.3990000000001
math right and he is a freaking

1838.679 --> 1843.8400000000001
psychopath

1840.399 --> 1846.7199999999998
so so all of them have some kind of like

1843.84 --> 1849.399
sociopathic Psychopathic narcissistic

1846.72 --> 1852.3990000000001
type of trait in some

1849.399 --> 1855.279
way and they're all gravers with this

1852.399 --> 1858.4799999999998
virtual winning currency all the time

1855.279 --> 1860.039
obsessed with it that's what they do do

1858.48 --> 1861.919
that's what they extract out of

1860.039 --> 1866.0
everything they

1861.919 --> 1866.0
do God we let the C

1866.159 --> 1869.159
in

1886.159 --> 1889.159
what

1976.039 --> 1979.039
for

1998.08 --> 2002.799
got my package got in that's

2005.96 --> 2008.96
cool

2033.519 --> 2038.96
and I'm

2035.96 --> 2038.96
back

2040.88 --> 2046.5590000000002
everything

2043.559 --> 2049.879
so

2046.559 --> 2052.919
illum nice and hot I'm going to have to

2049.879 --> 2052.919
let that cool for a

2058.079 --> 2061.079
bit

2065.879 --> 2068.879
right

2069.119 --> 2075.04
tting your Apprentice to cut timber

Carpenter Tommy that's

2084.079 --> 2089.679
cool oh by the way Tommy I can

2093.599 --> 2099.56
any drink like that you got to you you

2099.56 --> 2104.0
that you got to quit doing that my

2111.119 --> 2118.6400000000003
friend got to figure out something else

2115.52 --> 2121.28
because those kinds of fizzy sugary

2118.64 --> 2123.4
drinks are like one of the worst health

2121.28 --> 2127.6400000000003
hazards

2152.92 --> 2158.28
it buffering like

2187.96 --> 2192.0
or he wanted me to come on his show

2189.96 --> 2194.96
Friday and now he wants to come on my

2192.0 --> 2199.0
show Friday or something I don't know

2194.96 --> 2202.079
man I just find him so [ __ ] tedious

2199.0 --> 2203.88
if it was just mun like a guy just hang

2202.079 --> 2206.76
around in the chat that would be fine

2203.88 --> 2209.839
but he's like he's always followed up by

2206.76 --> 2214.0
these fleas of

2209.839 --> 2217.48
his you can't handle him oh my God just

2214.0 --> 2219.76
get rid of the fleas man

2217.48 --> 2222.079
I'd have you in my chat as a person if

2219.76 --> 2226.079
you weren't surrounded by all these

2222.079 --> 2226.079
gamma parasites that follow you

2232.28 --> 2237.2400000000002
around you know what I mean right

2234.4 --> 2239.8
Richard G I mean even the time when he

2237.24 --> 2244.8799999999997
came in my chat the fleas just came

2239.8 --> 2244.88
after him oh you can't have MC oh my

2245.599 --> 2248.599
God

2254.52 --> 2260.24
like if you guys do

2257.079 --> 2262.0
that when I get in somebody else's chat

2260.24 --> 2265.24
and I'm like hey

2262.0 --> 2266.96
hello and I noticed that like Richard G

2265.24 --> 2269.359
now you would never do that you would go

2266.96 --> 2271.76
in the chat like oh you can't handle or

2269.359 --> 2271.7599999999998
like

2274.68 --> 2278.7999999999997
dude that's not what we we

2285.92 --> 2291.4
do I mean it might be true but that

2289.88 --> 2294.6800000000003
doesn't mean that you have to go

2291.4 --> 2301.28
spamming that then there like we'll just

2294.68 --> 2303.96
have a talk about it in a safer space

2301.28 --> 2305.3590000000004
here yeah I know I know you would never

2303.96 --> 2307.76
do that Richard and that's why I

2305.359 --> 2311.319
appreciate you so much that's why you've

2307.76 --> 2311.3190000000004
never lost that wrench

2319.359 --> 2325.4
ever all right and I know duper pun

2322.119 --> 2328.6400000000003
actually does do that a bit but I mean

2325.4 --> 2328.64
when he does it it's kind of

2329.64 --> 2334.92
cute I yeah like but duper is

2335.52 --> 2338.52
different

2340.2 --> 2346.24
cocacola and smoking is

2343.4 --> 2349.76
bad

2346.24 --> 2353.2799999999997
the I'd say the Coca-Cola is worse of

2349.76 --> 2353.28
the two of those two

2359.64 --> 2365.1189999999997
really what do I

2362.119 --> 2367.359
do you go in places where I have

2365.119 --> 2370.6400000000003
arguments with other people in chats and

2367.359 --> 2370.64
then you stick up for me

2370.96 --> 2375.2
duper in a very youthful

2376.0 --> 2380.48
way and nobody's making you do

2381.64 --> 2387.72
that you did that even before I

2384.64 --> 2391.1189999999997
basically made you into a protector at

2387.72 --> 2391.1189999999997
hair on my

2393.119 --> 2397.28
show hey when people stick up for me out

2396.04 --> 2400.88
there

2397.28 --> 2400.88
I I do take notice of

2401.96 --> 2409.92
that I also take notice when people try

2404.68 --> 2409.9199999999996
to manipulate me though and and you

2413.2 --> 2418.1189999999997
haven't I'm quite certain of that

2415.8 --> 2420.599
because of well the metadata the

2418.119 --> 2422.6800000000003
spiritual metadata you were I was

2420.599 --> 2427.1600000000003
testing you in very specific ways and

2422.68 --> 2429.68
you were then confused which is

2427.16 --> 2432.96
the correct

2429.68 --> 2435.3999999999996
response to that to that

2432.96 --> 2440.2
test because if you actually had ill

2435.4 --> 2440.2000000000003
will I'd get other signals out of you

2443.16 --> 2449.7599999999998
then and that's how I know that you are

2445.8 --> 2449.76
just the way you are this is how you

2455.319 --> 2458.319
are

2459.839 --> 2465.0789999999997
anyway with great power comes great

2478.64 --> 2485.24
responsibility I displayed it up I'd say

2481.599 --> 2487.079
like with great power comes great

2485.24 --> 2491.9599999999996
corruption

2487.079 --> 2491.96
and with great intelligence comes great

2496.359 --> 2500.64
responsibility CU with great

2498.48 --> 2502.72
intelligence does not automatically

2500.64 --> 2506.68
comes come great

2502.72 --> 2510.319
corruption but if you Embrace a

2506.68 --> 2515.0
power that is what does

2510.319 --> 2515.0
that it's the power that corrupts

2515.04 --> 2521.24
you like

2517.2 --> 2524.4399999999996
embracing it or claiming it for your ego

2521.24 --> 2524.4399999999996
that's where the corruption

2524.88 --> 2530.7200000000003
happens just knowing about power having

2527.96 --> 2533.04
power because you know how things work

2530.72 --> 2537.2799999999997
doesn't automatically corrupt you it's

2533.04 --> 2540.2799999999997
when you decide that to unify that power

2537.28 --> 2543.28
with your ego and that is where the

2540.28 --> 2543.28
spirit is is

2543.359 --> 2550.68
corrupted where power itself self

2546.839 --> 2555.7999999999997
becomes like a demon making a deal with

2550.68 --> 2555.7999999999997
you cuz with power comes

2557.68 --> 2562.8799999999997
sacrifice like the world will make

2564.599 --> 2568.839
you

2566.52 --> 2570.8
anyway sounds like I'm talking about

2568.839 --> 2574.52
oakle

2570.8 --> 2577.04
no absolutely not although it'll apply

2574.52 --> 2581.04
to anybody

2577.04 --> 2581.04
I'm mostly talking about myself

2596.839 --> 2604.04
here oh wow ites much yeah but it

2601.48 --> 2604.04
doesn't

2605.079 --> 2609.7200000000003
though

2607.52 --> 2612.44
you

2609.72 --> 2615.68
see over at Nathan

2612.44 --> 2620.0
Oakley and that includes me or included

2615.68 --> 2624.0
me yeah we we don't really care about

2620.0 --> 2625.72
winning we care about how do we get to

2624.0 --> 2628.76
through to these

2625.72 --> 2632.24
people that are unwilling to be gotten

2628.76 --> 2634.6800000000003
through to about how we've won it's not

2632.24 --> 2637.2799999999997
about how we win it's how we've won how

2634.68 --> 2639.5589999999997
do we get through to them that we have

2637.28 --> 2642.8390000000004
one yeah that's the

2639.559 --> 2645.8
difference that's the angle of approach

2642.839 --> 2648.839
for us over at Nathan Oakley we have

2645.8 --> 2653.4
absolutely no uncertainty about that the

2648.839 --> 2657.0
Earth is measured and navigated

2653.4 --> 2660.76
flat you see that's a big

2657.0 --> 2665.0
difference CU we don't deal in currency

2660.76 --> 2669.2400000000002
of virtual seeming

2665.0 --> 2671.92
winds we have one we're more concerned

2669.24 --> 2674.5589999999997
as to how do we get through to people

2671.92 --> 2678.28
that do not want to be gotten through to

2674.559 --> 2681.96
about how we have one

2678.28 --> 2685.3190000000004
provably and how does the Willing

2681.96 --> 2689.2
ignorance psychological self-defense

2685.319 --> 2691.68
mechanism that they have prevent

2689.2 --> 2693.52
them from

2691.68 --> 2696.5989999999997
attaining that

2693.52 --> 2699.4
Insight that will make us achieve our

2696.599 --> 2701.88
goal of making them see how we have won

2699.4 --> 2704.64
it's no more fight it's no more debate

2701.88 --> 2707.6400000000003
we have won it's just how do we get

2704.64 --> 2709.68
through the people that we have that's

2707.64 --> 2710.72
the concern that we have over at the

2709.68 --> 2712.96
Flat Earth

2710.72 --> 2718.0789999999997
debates

2712.96 --> 2718.079
yeah hey if you want to get specific

2721.68 --> 2729.0789999999997
huh so no I I was definitely dead on

2726.04 --> 2731.96
with mun and not just mun it's also

2729.079 --> 2734.2400000000002
fight to Flat Earth Sim and Dan all

2731.96 --> 2735.88
those other figures they all have that

2734.24 --> 2738.7999999999997
in their own

2735.88 --> 2741.7200000000003
way but mun is like the most

2738.8 --> 2745.319
manipulative of all of them who is like

2741.72 --> 2749.5589999999997
really like compulsively manipulative

2745.319 --> 2751.92
underneath a a modus of

2749.559 --> 2754.6800000000003
Civility but he's never going to stop

2751.92 --> 2757.64
manipulate he never does like he can't

2754.68 --> 2760.1189999999997
help it he's comp impulsive if there's

2757.64 --> 2761.64
rest he's got to give it another try he

2760.119 --> 2764.359
can't help it and that's why I don't

2761.64 --> 2766.5589999999997
want to like officially engage with him

2764.359 --> 2769.2799999999997
because he's going to do that I don't

2766.559 --> 2773.6800000000003
want that to happen he's already done

2769.28 --> 2773.6800000000003
that with me I don't want it

2784.8 --> 2787.8
anymore

2788.72 --> 2796.64
oh my God would help if crew yeah

2793.559 --> 2801.8
well they do that continually Greg

2796.64 --> 2805.68
brunzel and you obviously are

2801.8 --> 2805.6800000000003
deaf and blind to

2805.8 --> 2812.6800000000003
it to make a statement like that so yeah

2810.2 --> 2817.7999999999997
we can't show that the

2812.68 --> 2817.7999999999997
willingly psychologically deaf and blind

2818.28 --> 2825.0400000000004
what they would need to know to get to

2821.8 --> 2828.6800000000003
our site which you are obviously and

2825.04 --> 2831.079
blatantly ignoring Greg runzel you what

2828.68 --> 2833.839
you think that we don't see what's there

2831.079 --> 2833.8390000000004
right in plain

2834.64 --> 2842.359
site yeah Flat Earth debates has been

2838.0 --> 2846.68
dedicated for like years like 2 years

2842.359 --> 2849.2799999999997
nonstop explanations and reg vitation of

2846.68 --> 2851.839
the same material same different sources

2849.28 --> 2854.079
all the sources all the references

2851.839 --> 2859.04
putting it in development arcs

2854.079 --> 2862.599
throughout history of available tools

2859.04 --> 2866.079
provably and like recreating scenarios

2862.599 --> 2869.44
like what would they do like you are a

2866.079 --> 2873.6400000000003
sailor on a ship with an i patch and a

2869.44 --> 2876.359
sexon what do you do yeah what could you

2873.64 --> 2880.2
have done what would have been known

2876.359 --> 2883.4
yeah we worked through all of it it's

2880.2 --> 2886.52
over you ignored all of it you didn't

2883.4 --> 2889.64
let it sink in you didn't assimilate the

2886.52 --> 2893.079
insights that are directly tied in with

2889.64 --> 2895.48
that entire process and so now you ask

2893.079 --> 2899.119
why didn't you do

2895.48 --> 2901.92
anything of everything we did actually

2899.119 --> 2908.1600000000003
do yeah because you ignored it and you

2901.92 --> 2908.16
were not capable of seeing it that's

2913.44 --> 2917.2400000000002
why other

2918.96 --> 2924.88
scientists not one other scientist they

2921.839 --> 2928.5589999999997
don't even know what bkin science

2924.88 --> 2930.359
is we've yet to find an actual scientist

2928.559 --> 2932.96
out there that is claimed to be a

2930.359 --> 2937.5589999999997
scientist that actually applies the

2932.96 --> 2939.7200000000003
scientific method s Theory

2937.559 --> 2941.8390000000004
there are some physicists that actually

2939.72 --> 2946.52
know what it

2941.839 --> 2947.92
is they kind of stay off the the scene

2946.52 --> 2953.88
because they

2947.92 --> 2953.88
know they know there's a pseudo science

2954.92 --> 2960.2400000000002
invasion in the minds of men they know

2958.64 --> 2961.92
and they try to stay out of it they just

2960.24 --> 2963.52
want to keep their job and they just

2961.92 --> 2966.079
want to do things the right way they

2963.52 --> 2967.7599999999998
don't want to get involved because then

2966.079 --> 2971.04
they'll get shame they'll get cold a

2967.76 --> 2971.0400000000004
flat earther even

2971.88 --> 2978.839
perhaps and they don't want that

2975.119 --> 2982.2000000000003
because then you get haunted down by a

2978.839 --> 2987.119
bunch of deranged delusional

2982.2 --> 2989.72
freaks that will be very satisfied to

2987.119 --> 2992.119
get you fired from your job and in all

2989.72 --> 2992.1189999999997
kinds of

2993.44 --> 3001.599
trouble so yeah

2996.72 --> 3004.2
only deranged lying

3001.599 --> 3008.599
numpties will

3004.2 --> 3010.68
come cuz the non deranged lying numpties

3008.599 --> 3012.599
know that if they come forward and

3010.68 --> 3014.799
they're just honest about how they see

3012.599 --> 3016.48
thing all the deranged lying numpties

3014.799 --> 3019.28
come after

3016.48 --> 3022.28
them they're not

3019.28 --> 3025.2000000000003
stupid they know how this

3022.28 --> 3027.44
works they probably had their fair share

3025.2 --> 3027.4399999999996
in

3027.72 --> 3033.04
school with these kinds of deranged

3030.079 --> 3035.799
peoples like among them as they are just

3033.04 --> 3040.24
trying to figure things out and get good

3035.799 --> 3040.24
at what they're what they want to do

3043.2 --> 3048.64
yeah if you stick too far out you get

3046.359 --> 3051.64
your head chopped

3048.64 --> 3051.64
off

3053.24 --> 3059.799
right unless your head is harder than

3056.44 --> 3059.799
the thing that's going to chop it

3070.0 --> 3077.599
off but yeah you can

3072.799 --> 3080.68
only make steel out of

3077.599 --> 3084.559
Iron by putting a punch of carbon in in

3080.68 --> 3087.8799999999997
in it in in the iron and then hammering

3084.559 --> 3090.2000000000003
it yeah compacting it you have you have

3087.88 --> 3092.28
to do that to your head you have to let

3090.2 --> 3094.5589999999997
it continually get you have to get

3092.28 --> 3098.0
smacked and then you get

3094.559 --> 3101.799
Harden like yeah I stick

3098.0 --> 3104.04
out I stick out of that grass you try to

3101.799 --> 3106.119
mow me down and those [ __ ] blades

3104.04 --> 3109.44
break you got

3106.119 --> 3113.559
it that's how you do

3109.44 --> 3117.7200000000003
it but it'll take everything in your

3113.559 --> 3119.3590000000004
life just to just to do

3117.72 --> 3122.1189999999997
that

3119.359 --> 3126.0789999999997
because if you have any liabilities

3122.119 --> 3127.76
around yeah your head might still be

3126.079 --> 3130.0
there and the blades might break but

3127.76 --> 3135.76
those blades might fly off and then

3130.0 --> 3135.76
suddenly they go after your wife or your

3138.079 --> 3141.079
kids

3144.28 --> 3147.28
right

3172.88 --> 3177.2400000000002
proven flat that way all of it

3180.76 --> 3187.3190000000004
that only takes one duper it only takes

3183.88 --> 3189.96
one to definitively prove that the Earth

3187.319 --> 3192.799
is not the sphere that the heliocentric

3189.96 --> 3192.799
model claims it

3192.88 --> 3200.2000000000003
is and there's literally no logical

3196.799 --> 3204.0
reason of any sort to even

3200.2 --> 3206.1189999999997
assume that the physics here in this

3204.0 --> 3208.88
realm work

3206.119 --> 3210.44
oriented anything other than

3208.88 --> 3213.48
flat

3210.44 --> 3219.16
like most of it is

3213.48 --> 3219.16
flat but what secret agent then

these ass wives like [ __ ] neurotic

3500.44 --> 3505.44
[ __ ] immediately have to talk [ __ ]

3503.28 --> 3508.119
about me like they they like these

3505.44 --> 3508.119
compulsive

3508.52 --> 3512.599
people that quite frankly

3514.559 --> 3521.039
I I think it would be best if somebody

3517.119 --> 3521.039
would just like put them out of their

3522.839 --> 3529.24
misery like people that behave that are

3527.28 --> 3533.28
like

3529.24 --> 3535.68
socially mentally deranged handicapped

3533.28 --> 3538.8390000000004
arguably and they shouldn't even be

3535.68 --> 3540.48
there capable of doing that I don't

3538.839 --> 3542.359
understand why the [ __ ] cottington

3540.48 --> 3546.72
doesn't just kick that [ __ ] deranged

3542.359 --> 3549.359
[ __ ] out cuz he is a tenacious bully and

3546.72 --> 3553.72
slanderer and

3549.359 --> 3556.0
liar who just nags other people for no

3553.72 --> 3556.0
damn

3561.599 --> 3568.6400000000003
reason have I ever been approached by

3564.24 --> 3568.64
anyone to do Secret go

3570.88 --> 3576.2400000000002
yeah but I can't tell you anything about

3573.24 --> 3576.24
it or i' have to kill

3584.68 --> 3590.2
you besides I don't even remember

3590.4 --> 3595.359
anymore as in what it exactly was that

3593.52 --> 3598.799
was done

3595.359 --> 3598.799
I kind of wiped that from my

3614.68 --> 3618.72
mind what type of work was

3620.68 --> 3626.5589999999997
it you wouldn't believe me even if I

3623.24 --> 3626.5589999999997
told you

3644.52 --> 3649.7599999999998
no jumped in fua what the [ __ ] does that

3647.839 --> 3653.52
even mean

3649.76 --> 3656.8390000000004
Tommy so cool that I've done that stuff

3653.52 --> 3659.92
yeah well you can all just call me silly

3656.839 --> 3663.7599999999998
and crazy because I can't prove it and

3659.92 --> 3663.76
nobody else can prove it

3670.559 --> 3675.4
either I mean as far as I'm concerned it

3673.319 --> 3677.72
it could have literally been a dark

3675.4 --> 3678.64
World experience I won't be able to tell

3677.72 --> 3681.0789999999997
it

3678.64 --> 3683.44
apart it might have happened it might

3681.079 --> 3686.44
have not

3683.44 --> 3686.44
happened

3688.039 --> 3693.3590000000004
I didn't know the names of the people

3689.96 --> 3695.4
involved I don't even remember their

3693.359 --> 3699.72
faces

3695.4 --> 3702.96
yeah this like what are you going to

3699.72 --> 3706.2799999999997
do as far as I could tell it was in my

3702.96 --> 3710.039
home country I don't know

3706.28 --> 3710.039
where I was not the

3713.44 --> 3716.44
driver

3725.0 --> 3732.319
was it government yeah

3728.0 --> 3734.559
sure what was governing of one form you

3732.319 --> 3734.5589999999997
could

3743.359 --> 3746.359
say

3761.359 --> 3769.96
D keyboard well one thing that I like I

3765.68 --> 3772.8799999999997
I'm not sure but logically deriving from

3769.96 --> 3772.88
the things that were

3773.359 --> 3777.119
happening

3774.96 --> 3779.44
like whether it's dark world or not like

3777.119 --> 3782.48
this might have simply been like a weird

3779.44 --> 3783.359
internal consideration of like could you

3782.48 --> 3787.2400000000002
do

3783.359 --> 3791.0
this I might have tried it

3787.24 --> 3793.799
out or it may not have actually been

3791.0 --> 3796.599
physically tried out but I mean at the

3793.799 --> 3800.319
time I had did have this weird psionic

3796.599 --> 3803.279
connection with the Jesuit guy right J

3800.319 --> 3806.5589999999997
guy was also a

3803.279 --> 3808.88
banker yeah Banker three years younger

3806.559 --> 3812.2000000000003
than me I

3808.88 --> 3817.599
don't it is what it

3812.2 --> 3822.2
is right but I think I might have been

3817.599 --> 3825.599
like part of like an intimidation effort

3822.2 --> 3829.48
one time to make somebody pay

3825.599 --> 3832.48
up multiple times even with multiple

3829.48 --> 3835.039
people I think I might have offered to

3832.48 --> 3838.96
just help him out

3835.039 --> 3841.079
and to test my skill I mean I can be

3838.96 --> 3844.839
kind of

3841.079 --> 3844.8390000000004
intimidating if you know what I

3848.24 --> 3852.7599999999998
mean but I can't prove any of

3863.2 --> 3866.2
this

3866.76 --> 3872.119
psionic Dark World wet work with the

3869.119 --> 3875.279
Jesuit guy what oh when you say it like

3872.119 --> 3875.279
that yeah it does sound

3876.4 --> 3882.0
intimidating am I a

3879.0 --> 3882.0
fighter

3893.16 --> 3896.16
no

3897.92 --> 3903.76
what seriously Greg Brunel you think

3900.64 --> 3906.24
that I was like look at my musles I'm

3903.76 --> 3908.88
going to break you you think that I

3906.24 --> 3911.279
would be intimidating in that way

3908.88 --> 3914.96
seriously

3911.279 --> 3920.799
hello we're talking about Arwin here

3914.96 --> 3926.079
right not some big Beefcake

3920.799 --> 3926.079
guy what what

3938.64 --> 3946.0
I could be like six

3941.279 --> 3949.0
whoa no Greg brunzel I'm not that

3946.0 --> 3952.0
tall unfortunately that would have been

3949.0 --> 3956.079
awesome although then my head would

3952.0 --> 3956.079
really have been freakishly large

3956.359 --> 3961.5589999999997
then unless my head would have been

3958.88 --> 3963.839
exactly this scale and my and my total

3961.559 --> 3967.279
body scaled up then would I would have

3963.839 --> 3969.7599999999998
been like Proto looking badass but yeah

3967.279 --> 3974.0
that's not what I am I got I got some

3969.76 --> 3974.0
Asian in there it's not doesn't work

3978.119 --> 3983.76
out [ __ ] sake

3980.72 --> 3987.279
mcfatty don't why do you keep bringing

3983.76 --> 3987.279
no crossbow damn

3987.72 --> 3993.8799999999997
it how tall am I uh 5' s

3995.0 --> 4000.0
actually which is exactly the average in

3998.039 --> 4002.5200000000004
accordance to om

4000.0 --> 4005.079
Benjamin you look short

4002.52 --> 4009.72
no I'm not that

4005.079 --> 4011.96
short also I'm very very flexible

4009.72 --> 4016.0
especially still for my

4011.96 --> 4016.0
age and I'm quick

4019.68 --> 4027.5989999999997
I can strike like the snake unseen and

4024.319 --> 4030.319
deadly and that's not a joke I can be

4027.599 --> 4030.319
lightning

4033.16 --> 4036.16
fast

4042.92 --> 4045.92
anyway

4055.119 --> 4061.2400000000002
capable dealing particularly cre and

4057.559 --> 4063.0
disgusting punishments yeah well

4061.24 --> 4066.0389999999998
tkc

4063.0 --> 4068.24
yes but it's not like I was sitting

4066.039 --> 4070.7990000000004
through somebody getting tortured or

4068.24 --> 4075.9199999999996
something the point

4070.799 --> 4075.92
was is to be the guy that's before that

4085.079 --> 4090.559
I'm the one that using

4090.76 --> 4097.4800000000005
words and spirit to convey the

4094.48 --> 4097.48
seriousness of the

4098.88 --> 4106.400000000001
situation to see if I can sway them

4102.52 --> 4109.0
somehow before it gets

4106.4 --> 4110.5599999999995
physical this is all really [ __ ] up

4109.0 --> 4112.92
when you think about

4110.56 --> 4115.2390000000005
it that's why I didn't think too much

4112.92 --> 4118.1990000000005
about it and I in the moment kind of in

4115.239 --> 4121.04
a weird delusional way saw it also from

4118.199 --> 4124.199
a social perspective as in like okay I'm

4121.04 --> 4127.159
giving these people the opportunity to

4124.199 --> 4129.96
Avail doing something to themselves what

4127.159 --> 4129.96
they're really going to

4130.12 --> 4134.3189999999995
regret and give them an opportunity for

4133.319 --> 4136.4400000000005
true

4134.319 --> 4138.679
clarity about even where they are in

4136.44 --> 4138.678999999999
their

4139.88 --> 4148.799
lives right the truth the real real

4145.239 --> 4148.799
truth can be very

4153.44 --> 4160.5599999999995
intimidating it's mostly about reminding

4157.359 --> 4162.719
them what they really love and that that

4160.56 --> 4165.719
is

4162.719 --> 4165.719
known

4174.56 --> 4183.359
so yeah kind of dark [ __ ] in the past

4179.799 --> 4185.12
unprovable I can't even tell 100% with

4183.359 --> 4186.88
certainty whether that actually those

4185.12 --> 4188.719
things really physically happen or

4186.88 --> 4191.4400000000005
whether they were very serious

4188.719 --> 4194.64
simulations in preparation for

4191.44 --> 4197.0
anticipation of potentially going to do

4194.64 --> 4199.2390000000005
that in a very dark career which I

4197.0 --> 4203.04
definitely didn't

4199.239 --> 4206.759999999999
do like as a real

4203.04 --> 4210.84
career [ __ ] hell I mean I would have

4206.76 --> 4210.84
not pro I probably paid very

4214.04 --> 4221.159
well but it would have extinguished like

4216.96 --> 4222.8
the sympath my my sympathy with Humanity

4221.159 --> 4224.4
that I have left right because I have a

4222.8 --> 4226.360000000001
lot of like

4224.4 --> 4228.879999999999
freaking humans they're all

4226.36 --> 4231.36
[ __ ] but I also have like yeah but

4228.88 --> 4233.6
they're also really nice and innocent

4231.36 --> 4235.759999999999
underneath all that well that part would

4233.6 --> 4239.52
have been completely destroyed if I had

4235.76 --> 4239.52
engaged in this

4239.8 --> 4247.0
career yeah and then what are you left

4242.88 --> 4250.4400000000005
with only this spies for Humanity so I'm

4247.0 --> 4250.44
very glad that I didn't do

4252.64 --> 4255.64
that

4282.56 --> 4289.8
m

4284.56 --> 4293.84
optimistic the truth is good news

4289.8 --> 4297.719
well yes the truth is always good news

4293.84 --> 4301.4400000000005
why esoterically metaphysically it's

4297.719 --> 4304.88
it's not just a belief it's provable the

4301.44 --> 4307.239
truth is always good news

4304.88 --> 4309.719
why because the truth is something you

4307.239 --> 4313.678999999999
can build

4309.719 --> 4316.56
on so even if you lost everything you

4313.679 --> 4318.159
now have something that you can build up

4316.56 --> 4322.4800000000005
on

4318.159 --> 4325.08
again well if you didn't have truth and

4322.48 --> 4328.599999999999
what are you going to rebuild on you're

4325.08 --> 4331.199
going to be just hanging on something

4328.6 --> 4333.4400000000005
instead because you don't know truth so

4331.199 --> 4335.48
truth is always good news even if it

4333.44 --> 4337.638999999999
comes with bad

4335.48 --> 4340.28
Tidings because if you know the truth

4337.639 --> 4342.4800000000005
then that you got something

4340.28 --> 4345.48
real to build

4342.48 --> 4345.48
upon

4345.8 --> 4350.719
in your mind right you you have the

4348.52 --> 4352.040000000001
reality in your mind to build to to hang

4350.719 --> 4354.92
on

4352.04 --> 4357.4
to and that is like really helpful if

4354.92 --> 4359.92
the picture in your mind about reality

4357.4 --> 4362.759999999999
is

4359.92 --> 4366.36
synchronous it's like with God it's is

4362.76 --> 4371.320000000001
real no Illusions in between there

4366.36 --> 4375.44
no no broken ideas no delusions right

4371.32 --> 4375.44
it's very powerful

4376.52 --> 4381.719
even if you lost everything hey that's

4379.56 --> 4385.320000000001
part of life you get things you lose

4381.719 --> 4385.32
things God gives God takes

4385.6 --> 4393.639
away but if you have the truth then at

4388.48 --> 4393.638999999999
least you got something to rebuild on

4394.48 --> 4399.08
always cuz what else are you going to do

4396.76 --> 4402.159000000001
give up you

4399.08 --> 4404.04
know you can't really give up giving up

4402.159 --> 4406.599999999999
is death

4404.04 --> 4410.56
so if you have the truth well then at

4406.6 --> 4410.56
least you have something solid to build

4432.36 --> 4435.36
on

4442.6 --> 4447.120000000001
you know where you stand in a hell hole

4462.28 --> 4465.28
Yeah

4465.76 --> 4471.400000000001
right but only if you

4469.04 --> 4474.92
know that it the Earth is like a

4471.4 --> 4476.759999999999
hellhole then you can also figure out it

4474.92 --> 4478.88
is also

4476.76 --> 4481.1990000000005
Heaven it's

4478.88 --> 4484.36
both it is

4481.199 --> 4487.04
Whatever frequency is sought after by

4484.36 --> 4490.679
the individuals

4487.04 --> 4492.04
and and the Alchemy of the combination

4490.679 --> 4495.32
of all that

4492.04 --> 4499.199
determines how Earth will be experienced

4495.32 --> 4499.199
as a heaven or as a hell or a

4499.28 --> 4506.719
combination we turn it into heaven or

4502.48 --> 4509.199
hell and every individual contributes to

4506.719 --> 4513.12
what it will

4509.199 --> 4513.12
become in between that

4518.08 --> 4522.199
Spectrum somebody's playing classical

4520.32 --> 4524.44
music that's

4522.199 --> 4526.919999999999
nice

4524.44 --> 4528.759999999999
what does Brian's logic do for a living

4526.92 --> 4531.32
computer programmer I don't know what

4528.76 --> 4531.320000000001
the hell he

4535.56 --> 4539.719
does I'll bet it has something to do

4538.0 --> 4543.96
with

4539.719 --> 4543.96
math or like measuring

4552.199 --> 4555.199
things

4557.159 --> 4561.159
I honestly don't know what he actually

4558.8 --> 4562.88
does but I don't think Brian is like

4561.159 --> 4566.0
poor or anything like

4562.88 --> 4568.28
he's he's clever he's resourceful he's

4566.0 --> 4568.28
not

4578.76 --> 4585.12
poor oh akum virus yeah yeah yeah yeah

4587.36 --> 4589.639
very

4608.679 --> 4615.08
funny all right so yeah I guess you guys

4611.679 --> 4615.08
moved on

4619.4 --> 4625.08
math teacher I doubt it he's not boring

4622.48 --> 4625.08
enough for

4640.8 --> 4645.84
that you're still curious about about

4643.239 --> 4648.239
the secret work well what are you

4645.84 --> 4648.2390000000005
curious

4670.4 --> 4677.5599999999995
about oh that's a low blow oh then don't

4673.56 --> 4679.96
tell him he's bad then don't blabber on

4677.56 --> 4684.080000000001
in my chat like Brian's bad at math

4679.96 --> 4684.08
Akuma virus you asked for

4693.52 --> 4701.6
it was that reason no what the

4698.199 --> 4705.48
[ __ ] no all of that [ __ ] if it even

4701.6 --> 4705.4800000000005
really happened was like many years

4722.639 --> 4730.1990000000005
ago in the time where I was still like

4726.48 --> 4734.919999999999
exploring hanging around with Shady

4730.199 --> 4734.919999999999
people figuring out

4739.56 --> 4744.719
basically like

4741.159 --> 4748.36
gangs really I didn't think of it like

4744.719 --> 4748.36
that but

4748.4 --> 4755.44
yeah probably signed an NDA oh

4752.44 --> 4758.08
really yeah I probably signed an NDA

4755.44 --> 4761.839999999999
that's why I'm elaborately just

4758.08 --> 4764.84
answering questions about it

4761.84 --> 4764.84
sure

4787.679 --> 4792.6
Brian's videos are like

4789.679 --> 4796.159
ASMR yeah for people that actually

4792.6 --> 4796.159000000001
understand math that's

4819.239 --> 4826.199
right yeah but just for the record okay

4822.4 --> 4829.638999999999
serious L I don't think I've ever signed

4826.199 --> 4829.638999999999
any agreement

4830.32 --> 4836.199
ever and if I have like I was forced to

4834.4 --> 4839.4
because I felt physically threatened in

4836.199 --> 4841.879999999999
the moment then I would like immediately

4839.4 --> 4844.32
after break it like in their face like

4841.88 --> 4846.1990000000005
I'm breaking your agreement right now

4844.32 --> 4849.199
because I no longer feel physically

4846.199 --> 4851.719
threatened and I don't make

4849.199 --> 4854.919999999999
deals you can't make

4851.719 --> 4857.679
me it's like I'm just not going to the

4854.92 --> 4860.96
Press with it because I don't care about

4857.679 --> 4863.12
your [ __ ] gravel operations I know

4860.96 --> 4865.84
it's not going to help I know you're

4863.12 --> 4868.4
tied in with that crap you got your

4865.84 --> 4873.0
connection like I know it doesn't work

4868.4 --> 4875.799999999999
but I will not be signing any [ __ ]

4873.0 --> 4875.8
agreements under

4876.6 --> 4882.4400000000005
duress he knew that about me eventually

4879.96 --> 4883.639
he tried it we're just trying it doesn't

4882.44 --> 4884.839999999999
work

4883.639 --> 4886.159000000001
I'll sign something and then I'll

4884.84 --> 4887.8
immediately break and then what are you

4886.159 --> 4889.839999999999
going to do what you're going to roll

4887.8 --> 4894.84
out all the supposed dirt you got about

4889.84 --> 4898.2390000000005
me cool I'll do the same for you who's

4894.84 --> 4898.2390000000005
got more to lose

4898.679 --> 4904.4
dumbass I mean I don't have a freaking

4901.28 --> 4906.5199999999995
secret operation here you do

4904.4 --> 4909.5599999999995
dummy

4906.52 --> 4912.080000000001
so I'm not going to like make a big

4909.56 --> 4915.159000000001
story out of it yeah I haven't talked

4912.08 --> 4917.639
about any any of it for 20 years and

4915.159 --> 4920.638999999999
even now after 20 years I am being

4917.639 --> 4921.8
extremely vague about it because well

4920.639 --> 4924.12
very

4921.8 --> 4927.360000000001
conveniently a a

4924.12 --> 4929.96
certain type of

4927.36 --> 4934.48
information like

4929.96 --> 4938.76
names have been just wipes and even

4934.48 --> 4942.199
faces so I just remember the structure

4938.76 --> 4943.360000000001
of it how it worked I remember how it

4942.199 --> 4947.599999999999
worked

4943.36 --> 4947.599999999999
I don't remember the names or the

4951.92 --> 4957.639
location I didn't know those people I

4954.4 --> 4960.679
had never seen those people before I did

4957.639 --> 4962.96
feel bad for them cuz I realized that

4960.679 --> 4965.159
they were

4962.96 --> 4967.04
tricked they thought they were all that

4965.159 --> 4971.0
and they got tricked into this and now

4967.04 --> 4975.04
they're like tied into this grabler

4971.0 --> 4979.0
trap it was pretty terrible for them but

4975.04 --> 4979.0
I couldn't be like it's not my [ __ ]

4980.36 --> 4985.839999999999
problem I was just there to like clear

4983.4 --> 4989.44
it up to

4985.84 --> 4991.84
them that's what I wanted to do

4989.44 --> 4993.919999999999
naturally like I wasn't even like oh

4991.84 --> 4997.76
you're contracted to do that no it's

4993.92 --> 5000.6
like no that is just what I do like

4997.76 --> 5003.400000000001
under any

5000.6 --> 5006.400000000001
circumstance I'm kind of weird like that

5003.4 --> 5008.759999999999
I could just be somewhere basically see

5006.4 --> 5011.239
somebody get tortured and then still

5008.76 --> 5015.08
have that objective as to

5011.239 --> 5018.4
like I could help clarify what's going

5015.08 --> 5021.84
on why this is happening what you could

5018.4 --> 5025.159
potentially do how you could live with

5021.84 --> 5025.159000000001
yourself I'm

5026.76 --> 5031.96
weird I try it's my way of trying to

5029.32 --> 5034.719
find the way through other than just

5031.96 --> 5037.32
berser tried to kill them all because

5034.719 --> 5040.12
it's atrocious what's all happening

5037.32 --> 5043.08
instead I have like a

5040.12 --> 5045.36
fractal inward process where I just try

5043.08 --> 5047.679
to find a way through with everything

5045.36 --> 5050.32
it's like I don't change anything I

5047.679 --> 5054.4800000000005
change things by potentially allowing

5050.32 --> 5054.48
those involved to change

5057.32 --> 5063.0
themselves it's actually quite

5060.04 --> 5065.6
psychologically complicated

5063.0 --> 5068.719
when that happens because the entire

5065.6 --> 5073.320000000001
process in retrospect seemed like it's

5068.719 --> 5076.04
a a personal so not from the outside a

5073.32 --> 5080.4
personal weaponized

5076.04 --> 5083.28
form of like constructive Stockholm

5080.4 --> 5088.5199999999995
syndrome it's like instead of just being

5083.28 --> 5088.5199999999995
a slave you reformat

5091.36 --> 5094.36
it

5094.56 --> 5098.679
right instead of just oh my God I'm into

5097.159 --> 5101.799999999999
this Oh

5098.679 --> 5103.4
no I got to do it instead of that it's

5101.8 --> 5106.28
just like no I

5103.4 --> 5109.599999999999
just reroute everything and just like

5106.28 --> 5112.239
become this constructive robot just if I

5109.6 --> 5115.719
just fix as much as I can within

5112.239 --> 5117.119
people's minds by keeping this oversight

5115.719 --> 5120.44
completely

5117.119 --> 5122.0
selflessly like even with risk on my

5120.44 --> 5124.32
what I could happen to me is like that

5122.0 --> 5128.52
doesn't matter anymore

5124.32 --> 5131.119
then and then I just figure the way

5128.52 --> 5132.84
through like even if they could they

5131.119 --> 5135.36
could like panic and just kill me and

5132.84 --> 5136.92
I'm like I don't care I'm going to

5135.36 --> 5140.799999999999
figure out this way through in this

5136.92 --> 5140.8
moment because I can it's a very unique

5141.56 --> 5148.96
skill it's like a reversed Socom

5144.88 --> 5148.96
syndrome flip it inside

5151.28 --> 5154.28
out

5164.7 --> 5167.7699999999995
[Music]

5174.0 --> 5178.639
right but what it also comes down to to

5176.88 --> 5184.1990000000005
a degree is

5178.639 --> 5184.1990000000005
that if I'm in danger I can like

5185.44 --> 5191.678999999999
I can protect my

5187.239 --> 5196.36
sensories by temporarily turning them

5191.679 --> 5199.8
off and that sort of creates a temporary

5196.36 --> 5202.88
simulation of a psychopath mindset it's

5199.8 --> 5205.320000000001
a diminished manifestation form and like

5202.88 --> 5207.76
I am effectively different like that

5205.32 --> 5210.08
it's very unnatural though it's almost

5207.76 --> 5211.679
like you're in a drug that just you have

5210.08 --> 5215.719
you live and you're having a drug that

5211.679 --> 5219.639
suppresses certain traits except I'm

5215.719 --> 5222.76
actively doing that with my con with my

5219.639 --> 5225.52
subconscious it's something I do to put

5222.76 --> 5225.52
myself in the

5226.04 --> 5231.76
setting and it doesn't last very long

5228.679 --> 5234.8
because I get sick over time because the

5231.76 --> 5238.52
thing that's I'm suppressing needs to

5234.8 --> 5238.52
like do its

5239.199 --> 5246.678999999999
thing and that requires expression

5243.88 --> 5249.639
but that expression is in the way of

5246.679 --> 5252.56
getting through the situation and then I

5249.639 --> 5255.04
like suddenly I like completely turn off

5252.56 --> 5257.4800000000005
my feelings when that's something that's

5255.04 --> 5259.56
very not like me naturally I'm very

5257.48 --> 5264.239
expressive right guys I'm

5259.56 --> 5267.6
very all of the energy and very

5264.239 --> 5270.04
intense but I have in the past under

5267.6 --> 5273.1990000000005
kind of like emergency like managed to

5270.04 --> 5275.36
like I can just like cck

5273.199 --> 5280.199
I'm like a [ __ ] robot like literally

5275.36 --> 5283.04
the feelings are like now alien to me I

5280.199 --> 5283.04
will ignore

5283.28 --> 5288.679
them and it works it works really well

5286.04 --> 5292.08
to maintain like high functioning

5288.679 --> 5294.1990000000005
Clarity within the mind and to minimize

5292.08 --> 5295.92
the amount of fear hormones that are

5294.199 --> 5298.5199999999995
going to be

5295.92 --> 5301.08
released by just turning off that

5298.52 --> 5304.56
sensory it's like yeah if the alarm

5301.08 --> 5307.5199999999995
sensor is tur off then the alarm can't

5304.56 --> 5309.92
get go off with all

5307.52 --> 5312.679
the side effects that come with it

5309.92 --> 5315.8
including like fear hormone and all

5312.679 --> 5318.4400000000005
that so like yeah I'm in hyper danger so

5315.8 --> 5320.4400000000005
I'm just going to stop carrying now to

5318.44 --> 5323.159
carry

5320.44 --> 5326.04
on and that

5323.159 --> 5328.44
worked it might still work that

5326.04 --> 5331.0
mechanism it's just that I don't really

5328.44 --> 5332.759999999999
find myself in a lot of situations where

5331.0 --> 5337.4
I

5332.76 --> 5337.400000000001
where I could even do

5346.36 --> 5351.599999999999
that okay but I am technically

5349.36 --> 5354.4
psychologically very

5351.6 --> 5358.719
flexible if it's needed it's just not

5354.4 --> 5358.719
something I can continually do all the

5360.28 --> 5365.5599999999995
time because in a way when I do those

5363.08 --> 5367.5599999999995
types of things and like

5365.56 --> 5370.56
really

5367.56 --> 5373.84
totally take control over like the

5370.56 --> 5377.88
mechanisms in my head very

5373.84 --> 5382.88
rigidly that's like top sport that's

5377.88 --> 5387.639
like the moment that the the uh Olympic

5382.88 --> 5391.119
Sporter does his maximum like

5387.639 --> 5393.4800000000005
that's that's that it's not just oh

5391.119 --> 5396.5199999999995
casual feet right I mean I can do

5393.48 --> 5400.44
Ballwin as a pretty casual

5396.52 --> 5404.040000000001
feat but Ballwin is

5400.44 --> 5406.48
just that's just like suspending the

5404.04 --> 5408.4
disbelief in a very specific way it's

5406.48 --> 5410.959999999999
not that complicated that's why even

5408.4 --> 5412.5599999999995
like adamin can do it Brian can do it

5410.96 --> 5416.119
even Nathan himself can do it he just

5412.56 --> 5419.080000000001
hates it right it's not even that

5416.119 --> 5422.08
difficult if you have some smartness to

5419.08 --> 5426.4
you then you can actually learn to do

5422.08 --> 5431.04
that but like really suppressing it

5426.4 --> 5436.04
like total feeling Spectrum under duress

5431.04 --> 5440.04
like that is difficult like that's very

5436.04 --> 5442.84
trying potentially strenuous on your

5440.04 --> 5446.4
system cuz you have to like trick your

5442.84 --> 5450.28
system that it's not going on when there

5446.4 --> 5452.239
is actually something going on and it's

5450.28 --> 5454.599999999999
actually dangerous so it's not not just

5452.239 --> 5458.44
like oh I'm fooling myself not to

5454.6 --> 5460.56
believe this that's easy no convincing

5458.44 --> 5462.879999999999
yourself that something isn't actually

5460.56 --> 5465.4800000000005
dangerous when it is actually dangerous

5462.88 --> 5468.52
yeah that's much more

5465.48 --> 5471.119
difficult more strenuous on your

5468.52 --> 5473.4800000000005
system you'd think that a lot of these

5471.119 --> 5475.679
freaking New World Order politicians out

5473.48 --> 5477.08
there are actually really good at that

5475.679 --> 5479.2390000000005
because they continually seem to be

5477.08 --> 5481.96
doing

5479.239 --> 5483.959999999999
that just thinking of things that are

5481.96 --> 5486.159
actually dangerous as not being

5483.96 --> 5488.84
dangerous and it just they don't turn it

5486.159 --> 5491.08
off anymore maybe they maybe they just

5488.84 --> 5492.4800000000005
use this ability too many times and they

5491.08 --> 5494.159
can't turn it off anymore and so they

5492.48 --> 5497.119
have effectively

5494.159 --> 5502.239
become like self reinforced Psy

5497.119 --> 5502.239
Psychopaths that way they can't turn it

5505.36 --> 5511.0
off right I mean not all of them are

5508.96 --> 5514.679
like born like that it's a trick they

5511.0 --> 5516.32
learned a mode they go into and then

5514.679 --> 5519.04
they don't turn it

5516.32 --> 5521.4
off and well when you like continually

5519.04 --> 5523.199
suppress your sensories in a certain way

5521.4 --> 5527.119
well guess what happens you become very

5523.199 --> 5527.119
vulnerable now to that type of sensory

5527.239 --> 5533.08
input so even if it would somehow be

5530.44 --> 5536.599999999999
allowed to turn back on you'd be like oh

5533.08 --> 5539.96
oh my god oh no oh no what did I do like

5536.6 --> 5542.159000000001
ah quick forget about it forget about

5539.96 --> 5544.92
those feelings again so I can be

5542.159 --> 5547.239
functional with what I had again and so

5544.92 --> 5551.6
they're stuck

5547.239 --> 5556.0
forever they can't confront the feelings

5551.6 --> 5558.04
anymore it would rearrange their entire

5556.0 --> 5560.159
priority system it would make them

5558.04 --> 5562.36
realize if they allow those feelings

5560.159 --> 5565.5199999999995
back that everything they've done is

5562.36 --> 5567.48
completely idiotic and destructive and

5565.52 --> 5571.76
that they want to do the

5567.48 --> 5575.239
opposite but then they lose everything

5571.76 --> 5578.639
and so they just forget about

5575.239 --> 5582.239
it forget that anything was

5578.639 --> 5583.679
there keep going with what you're doing

5582.239 --> 5585.678999999999
and then you don't lose everything then

5583.679 --> 5589.08
everything stays the way it

5585.679 --> 5591.08
is and you don't realize that you've

5589.08 --> 5593.96
actually been destroying everything

5591.08 --> 5593.96
including your own

5595.239 --> 5599.159
future I think that that is the

5597.08 --> 5601.04
predicament that a lot of these elitists

5599.159 --> 5603.0
are into they're just invested in these

5601.04 --> 5604.719
plans and they' start to catch on that

5603.0 --> 5606.52
they're actually destroying everything

5604.719 --> 5610.159
and that they're super hated and that

5606.52 --> 5613.280000000001
they're going to end really bad but they

5610.159 --> 5615.599999999999
can't deal with that realization they

5613.28 --> 5618.48
just got to keep going so they learn to

5615.6 --> 5619.88
suppress all the feelings that would

5618.48 --> 5625.32
associate

5619.88 --> 5625.32
with the good nature of stopping

5625.36 --> 5628.36
it

5630.56 --> 5633.56
yeah

5637.04 --> 5641.719
yeah willing ignorance that's what that

5639.239 --> 5643.839999999999
comes down to willing

5641.719 --> 5647.2390000000005
ignorance that's what the the

5643.84 --> 5647.2390000000005
politicians out there are

5648.48 --> 5654.959999999999
doing CU if they knew what they were

5650.84 --> 5658.76
doing they couldn't they couldn't carry

5654.96 --> 5662.199
on only the ignorant could follow up on

5658.76 --> 5663.84
such an elaborate and complete

5662.199 --> 5667.04
self-destructive

5663.84 --> 5669.32
plan no consciousness could touch it and

5667.04 --> 5669.32
hold

5685.119 --> 5691.36
on wow what am I going to call this

5689.199 --> 5695.04
show I hope you guys have been enjoying

5691.36 --> 5695.04
it it's been very psychologically

5699.44 --> 5705.04
intense I'm definitely not going to call

5701.719 --> 5706.88
this forget about it that's not cool I

5705.04 --> 5711.639
don't want to I want to

5706.88 --> 5711.639
actually I want the chat the title to

5712.199 --> 5720.0
reflect the intellectual

5716.199 --> 5723.04
depths not a generalized funny

5720.0 --> 5725.84
catchphrase that any [ __ ] would like

5723.04 --> 5725.84
that's what I don't

5726.76 --> 5736.04
want pic work without any what the

5732.52 --> 5736.040000000001
hell how is it

5741.639 --> 5745.56
pic is that

5750.4 --> 5753.4
aess

5754.04 --> 5760.679
right but I mean the point is about the

5756.56 --> 5760.679
NDA I never signed a piece of

5760.92 --> 5766.1990000000005
paper and everything that I and everyone

5764.159 --> 5767.92
that I dealed with under any condition I

5766.199 --> 5771.44
was always say I'm

5767.92 --> 5773.8
like I'm going to eventually talk about

5771.44 --> 5778.48
this but not right

5773.8 --> 5781.360000000001
now it's like a contract I had the my

5778.48 --> 5783.638999999999
contract is I'm studying all this in

5781.36 --> 5787.32
including like potentially criminal

5783.639 --> 5789.96
stuff I'm studying it but I guarantee

5787.32 --> 5792.5199999999995
you all that I will not like

5789.96 --> 5794.84
compulsively try to expose you because

5792.52 --> 5797.76
that's not why I'm here I'm here to

5794.84 --> 5802.08
understand why this is

5797.76 --> 5803.96
happening and how it works and like what

5802.08 --> 5807.719
you feel about

5803.96 --> 5809.159
that how much are you conscious of what

5807.719 --> 5812.2390000000005
it is that you're

5809.159 --> 5815.119
doing and when you do does that change

5812.239 --> 5817.44
your view on things does that make you

5815.119 --> 5819.679
want to get out or does that make you

5817.44 --> 5824.96
want to protect your Turf in doing this

5819.679 --> 5827.679
even more I studied it in secret like

5824.96 --> 5831.4800000000005
nobody knew that it's not

5827.679 --> 5834.4400000000005
nothing I could have gotten like killed

5831.48 --> 5835.5199999999995
potentially cuz no I wasn't doing

5834.44 --> 5837.799999999999
anything

5835.52 --> 5840.52
officially I could have just disappeared

5837.8 --> 5842.52
and people would not have found out

5840.52 --> 5844.4800000000005
because it was nothing official that I

5842.52 --> 5846.360000000001
was doing I wasn't telling anybody that

5844.48 --> 5849.08
I was basically hanging with criminals

5846.36 --> 5849.08
just to study

5854.44 --> 5861.28
them but it was just this understanding

5857.28 --> 5864.08
and it worked it worked guys I did get

5861.28 --> 5866.32
to see a lot of

5864.08 --> 5869.159
things I did get to see like

5866.32 --> 5872.639
racketeering operations

5869.159 --> 5876.04
even really freaky scary it's like oh my

5872.639 --> 5876.04
God I hope this doesn't happen to

5877.56 --> 5882.320000000001
me like that scared the [ __ ] out of me

5880.44 --> 5886.0
that there's racketeering going on out

5882.32 --> 5888.679
there apparently like right here in this

5886.0 --> 5891.599
country and the people that get that

5888.679 --> 5893.1990000000005
they often don't report it it then that

5891.599 --> 5897.0
freaks me

5893.199 --> 5900.759999999999
out in a way but I know I know it's

5897.0 --> 5901.84
there because I was there on like in the

5900.76 --> 5906.119000000001
car

5901.84 --> 5906.119000000001
seeing them do that like what the

5912.639 --> 5920.599
[ __ ] right but they knew they knew like

5917.04 --> 5923.32
I'm never going to like expose them I'm

5920.599 --> 5928.08
never my presence is never going to

5923.32 --> 5928.08
result them going to prison all of a

5928.8 --> 5934.679
sudden right and and that's why they all

5932.719 --> 5939.159
just let me

5934.679 --> 5939.159
hang and let me ask questions

5939.719 --> 5946.639
even and yes a lot of those types would

5944.32 --> 5949.159
eventually like feel seduced because

5946.639 --> 5952.08
it's like yeah this guy is kind of crazy

5949.159 --> 5957.598999999999
isn't he to do that you like yeah yeah I

5952.08 --> 5959.679
kind of am but I mean it's a opportunity

5957.599 --> 5962.4800000000005
that I cannot deny

5959.679 --> 5964.92
myself and so some of them actually triy

5962.48 --> 5967.28
to manipulate me like they manip they

5964.92 --> 5971.84
try to manipulate in becoming part of a

5967.28 --> 5974.8
cult even they cult I very kindly

5971.84 --> 5977.56
declined yeah but they really tried that

5974.8 --> 5979.88
because they thought I was crazy to even

5977.56 --> 5982.52
hang around with

5979.88 --> 5984.4400000000005
them and then learning all that and then

5982.52 --> 5987.56
being like wow that's really fascinating

5984.44 --> 5990.159
how you do that how you basically scam

5987.56 --> 5991.639
people and not talking about a bunch of

5990.159 --> 5996.44
internet scam

5991.639 --> 5996.4400000000005
yeah talking about face to face things

6003.32 --> 6008.48
fascinating so I've seen all kinds of

6005.639 --> 6008.4800000000005
stuff out

6015.88 --> 6022.96
there did the do that money laundering

6023.159 --> 6028.96
I they

6026.04 --> 6031.44
might I never

6028.96 --> 6035.08
really got into that

6031.44 --> 6038.36
part you know why because I wasn't

6035.08 --> 6042.28
interesting in hey how can I get money

6038.36 --> 6044.28
out of this I just wanted to know what

6042.28 --> 6046.5599999999995
they were

6044.28 --> 6047.84
doing how they thought they could get

6046.56 --> 6052.280000000001
away with

6047.84 --> 6054.1990000000005
it and just what it's like like like

6052.28 --> 6055.44
when they're doing does it actually feel

6054.199 --> 6059.48
like it's worth

6055.44 --> 6059.48
it like

6059.56 --> 6065.76
yeah and like my own analysis like me

6063.92 --> 6067.679
testing them like I think you're

6065.76 --> 6071.04
suppressing certain things about it

6067.679 --> 6074.2390000000005
aren't you so I would actually like even

6071.04 --> 6076.159
have opportunities where I while they're

6074.239 --> 6078.959999999999
doing still in the middle of criminal

6076.159 --> 6081.719
operations like I was able to actually

6078.96 --> 6083.8
like confront them up very close like

6081.719 --> 6086.04
you're kind of lying about this part to

6083.8 --> 6088.4400000000005
yourself aren't you that would be very

6086.04 --> 6090.48
shocking to them they would almost like

6088.44 --> 6093.32
how dare you how dare you I'm going to

6090.48 --> 6095.678999999999
slap you if you say that again kind of

6093.32 --> 6099.32
thing but i'

6095.679 --> 6101.119
still I do that because I have to

6099.32 --> 6104.32
because it's me and that's where I'm

6101.119 --> 6107.48
there for I'm there to

6104.32 --> 6109.5199999999995
study how they were actually doing it

6107.48 --> 6112.04
and how they had to live with it and

6109.52 --> 6114.2390000000005
what that means

6112.04 --> 6116.679
I was basically trying to figure out can

6114.239 --> 6120.159
you be a criminal and be completely

6116.679 --> 6122.76
honest and pure about yourself and not

6120.159 --> 6124.759999999999
end up lying about certain things to

6122.76 --> 6127.08
live with

6124.76 --> 6130.280000000001
yourself everything I've studied prove

6127.08 --> 6130.28
that it is absolutely

6132.44 --> 6138.36
impossible and partially because of that

6135.92 --> 6139.52
conclusion from that elaborate study

6138.36 --> 6142.799999999999
which is really

6139.52 --> 6146.679
crazy I am

6142.8 --> 6152.08
now like to call it religiously is like

6146.679 --> 6153.8
a is not doing it justice it's I am like

6152.08 --> 6156.599
obsessively

6153.8 --> 6159.96
religiously truthful and I'm like yeah

6156.599 --> 6163.4800000000005
poverty man oh my God yes poverty above

6159.96 --> 6167.88
criminal criminality oh my God yes so

6163.48 --> 6171.678999999999
much more doable you live longer way way

6167.88 --> 6177.84
longer it is doable it is worth it and

6171.679 --> 6181.32
God likes you for that and through other

6177.84 --> 6183.84
people you will be better people respect

6181.32 --> 6186.799999999999
people that choose to be poor way more

6183.84 --> 6186.8
than they respect

6189.48 --> 6195.119
criminals and people will always see

6192.199 --> 6197.799999999999
what you got on the inside if you have

6195.119 --> 6200.119
criminal things you do it will be seen

6197.8 --> 6202.4400000000005
even if you're not seeing it about

6200.119 --> 6206.159
yourself

6202.44 --> 6209.4
other people will see it and

6206.159 --> 6213.4
so I am honest about everything I I

6209.4 --> 6213.4
purge all the secrets

6219.56 --> 6225.56
inside and that

6221.84 --> 6225.56
is now where I'm

6226.88 --> 6231.28
at yeah some people

6229.679 --> 6233.639
they

6231.28 --> 6235.719
they go to high school or university and

6233.639 --> 6237.8
they do a study and then oh look read

6235.719 --> 6239.32
this book or read that book and then

6237.8 --> 6241.679
they become a

6239.32 --> 6244.719
psycher

6241.679 --> 6248.76
yeah I just hung around with crazy

6244.719 --> 6251.28
people and criminals and studied them at

6248.76 --> 6253.92
high risk without anybody knowing about

6251.28 --> 6257.199
that what was going on no insurance

6253.92 --> 6259.599
nothing I just like Hey Oh everybody's

6257.199 --> 6261.598999999999
all concerned about the money I'm like

6259.599 --> 6263.96
hey I'm here at the [ __ ] fix the

6261.599 --> 6263.96
human

6264.719 --> 6275.88
mind and I will risk everything to get

6271.76 --> 6278.52
there like including my life including a

6275.88 --> 6282.4800000000005
career everything I want to make a

6278.52 --> 6285.360000000001
difference with my talents in this world

6282.48 --> 6289.5199999999995
and if I'm going to chase after money I

6285.36 --> 6292.28
will not be able to make that difference

6289.52 --> 6296.76
and I knew that very

6292.28 --> 6300.08
early every the goal above

6296.76 --> 6303.76
everything really knowing what it is to

6300.08 --> 6307.0
have an a real view on

6303.76 --> 6311.119000000001
reality and being able to

6307.0 --> 6314.08
judge what is what better because of

6311.119 --> 6316.719
that and it was worth it it was

6314.08 --> 6319.5599999999995
definitely worth the risk and I'm i' I'm

6316.719 --> 6321.28
very happy to get out of it pretty much

6319.56 --> 6323.04
unscathed

6321.28 --> 6325.4
despite some risky moments here and

6323.04 --> 6326.639
there when I did definitely piss people

6325.4 --> 6330.239
off

6326.639 --> 6332.4800000000005
and I was so good at it at figuring

6330.239 --> 6335.759999999999
people out that some were actually like

6332.48 --> 6338.239
he's he's a [ __ ] fed you look this

6335.76 --> 6339.76
[ __ ] up it's like no I've never met you

6338.239 --> 6342.44
before I swear

6339.76 --> 6344.84
it I could just see it I could just see

6342.44 --> 6347.28
everything it's like magic it's

6344.84 --> 6349.4800000000005
like this is what you are this is what

6347.28 --> 6352.36
you do this is why you do

6349.48 --> 6355.04
it

6352.36 --> 6356.96
and it's okay like you're the one that

6355.04 --> 6358.92
has the problem with it not me like I

6356.96 --> 6362.56
don't know you I'm never going to I

6358.92 --> 6364.88
don't even remember your your face in

6362.56 --> 6368.4400000000005
five

6364.88 --> 6370.719
days but I can give you this Insight

6368.44 --> 6373.799999999999
right now because that is my unique

6370.719 --> 6373.8
ability like an

6376.639 --> 6382.84
oracle like an oracle reading is not

6380.08 --> 6385.639
some idea you keep around in your head

6382.84 --> 6387.4400000000005
and you digest it like oh I'm gonna like

6385.639 --> 6390.28
really roll out this idea and then the

6387.44 --> 6392.719
person ask oh Oracle what about this oh

6390.28 --> 6394.5599999999995
here it comes they really thought about

6392.719 --> 6397.119
refined idea no that's not what an

6394.56 --> 6400.04
oracle does an oracle is just like la la

6397.119 --> 6403.28
la somebody asks a question and

6400.04 --> 6404.5199999999995
then here it is and you're like whoa

6403.28 --> 6407.759999999999
yeah that's the

6404.52 --> 6409.159000000001
answer yes it my Consciousness is not

6407.76 --> 6412.08
even that

6409.159 --> 6415.879999999999
involved this it's like no I am just the

6412.08 --> 6420.0
Oracle answers it has nothing barely

6415.88 --> 6420.0
anything to do with me as a conscious

6421.159 --> 6425.32
person right that's an

6425.36 --> 6430.679
oracle a person has an oracle

6431.36 --> 6437.48
power the Oracle power is not something

6434.159 --> 6441.32
you wield it takes

6437.48 --> 6444.839999999999
you it temporarily like

6441.32 --> 6447.0
replaces your conscious control and just

6444.84 --> 6449.04
gives a readout that's completely

6447.0 --> 6451.04
separate from where your consciously

6449.04 --> 6453.76
thinking about as a

6451.04 --> 6457.04
person it's a separate thing it comes

6453.76 --> 6460.2390000000005
from God it comes from above comes

6457.04 --> 6463.96
from another depth where your

6460.239 --> 6467.44
Consciousness doesn't normally dwell cuz

6463.96 --> 6467.44
it's way too intense in

6469.32 --> 6473.719
there

6471.96 --> 6476.159
and like if you're going to go by chakra

6473.719 --> 6479.08
logic it's probably from the chakra

6476.159 --> 6481.119
that's right above your head oh yeah

6479.08 --> 6484.44
there's there's

6481.119 --> 6486.88
that yeah

6484.44 --> 6491.0
right I mean everybody know was like oh

6486.88 --> 6494.04
you got the the light blue the vocal

6491.0 --> 6497.0
chakra and you got the deep blue the

6494.04 --> 6499.92
mind me visual chakra and then you got

6497.0 --> 6502.119
the purple chakra right on top yeah but

6499.92 --> 6506.599
did you know there's also a chakra right

6502.119 --> 6510.36
above that like 10 cm something like

6506.599 --> 6513.96
that above your skull outside of your

6510.36 --> 6516.199
physical body yeah there's one over

6513.96 --> 6516.199
there

6522.4 --> 6526.36
too there's all kinds of

6529.199 --> 6532.199
sources

6537.4 --> 6542.799999999999
it's okay if you have been in a bad past

6539.92 --> 6544.2390000000005
because God loves a sinner what are you

6542.8 --> 6547.4400000000005
talking

6544.239 --> 6550.239
about God does not love

6547.44 --> 6554.5199999999995
Sinners God loves

6550.239 --> 6555.5599999999995
Redemption God hates sin or rather sin

6554.52 --> 6558.56
hates

6555.56 --> 6562.4400000000005
reality reality hates

6558.56 --> 6564.639
sin but redemp ion is the recognition of

6562.44 --> 6569.239
sin and

6564.639 --> 6572.639
then aligning with reality right the

6569.239 --> 6572.638999999999
truth God

6573.159 --> 6578.5599999999995
reality you align with it you accept it

6576.84 --> 6581.56
you adapt to

6578.56 --> 6581.56
it

6582.719 --> 6587.719
Redemption if you are

6585.159 --> 6590.799999999999
delusional you don't see things as they

6587.719 --> 6595.159
really are God hates that that's

6590.8 --> 6598.320000000001
delusion that's Satan's frequency it's

6595.159 --> 6600.879999999999
his design it's Satan's design the

6598.32 --> 6600.88
design of

6617.36 --> 6623.92
delusion depends on yeah no I'm Sorry

6620.719 --> 6626.44
God does not like sin it's the whole

6623.92 --> 6626.4400000000005
freaking

6626.88 --> 6633.52
point it's the whole point of it it's

6630.8 --> 6636.28
ridiculous to say that he would like sin

6633.52 --> 6637.599
he does not like sin and God does not

6636.28 --> 6642.8
like

6637.599 --> 6647.679
Sinners it's like reality doesn't like

6642.8 --> 6651.679
sin why because sin can provably lead to

6647.679 --> 6653.84
worse things or damage you it's

6651.679 --> 6657.679
counterproductive to the

6653.84 --> 6662.079
Design's optimal efficiency

6657.679 --> 6664.2390000000005
function that's sin sin is going against

6662.079 --> 6669.4
the better

6664.239 --> 6669.4
way physically naturally

6671.88 --> 6678.8
logically if you hold

6674.079 --> 6682.119
on then to sin then you literally don't

6678.8 --> 6684.56
abide by the truth about the design and

6682.119 --> 6687.079
everything God does not like that and

6684.56 --> 6690.679
reality doesn't like that when you sin

6687.079 --> 6692.96
and you're more subjected to entropy

6690.679 --> 6697.8
provably the more you sin the more

6692.96 --> 6700.32
entropy you're subjected to you age

6697.8 --> 6702.1990000000005
quicker really

6700.32 --> 6704.88
happens okay I'm going to kick this

6702.199 --> 6704.879999999999
freaking cat

6708.96 --> 6711.96
out

6738.88 --> 6741.88
yeah

6828.76 --> 6832.719
m

6830.639 --> 6835.84
why would God not like a part of its own

6832.719 --> 6835.84
design it's

6837.56 --> 6842.52
metaphysically and he doesn't not like

6840.199 --> 6846.04
part of his own design it's just that if

6842.52 --> 6850.079000000001
you don't follow the logic of the design

6846.04 --> 6850.079
then you don't work as

6858.28 --> 6864.199
well Satan design be part yeah well

6861.639 --> 6868.04
that's what he does Satan tries to

6864.199 --> 6869.239
design through delusion T to take God's

6868.04 --> 6871.76
design

6869.239 --> 6874.4
twisted and then have a parallel

6871.76 --> 6878.4400000000005
constructed false

6874.4 --> 6878.44
design that's called the beast

6884.199 --> 6891.678999999999
system no God does not mess up

6888.679 --> 6891.679
anything

6892.44 --> 6898.638999999999
absolutely ridiculous God Is Timeless

6896.04 --> 6901.04
he's already designed everything that is

6898.639 --> 6903.599
possible throughout all of time

6901.04 --> 6903.599
beginning to

6905.44 --> 6912.4
end we're just here to play out a linear

6909.719 --> 6918.599
timeline of his

6912.4 --> 6921.119
design and choose within that path of

6918.599 --> 6923.119000000001
time

6921.119 --> 6927.719
there is no messing

6923.119 --> 6930.799999999999
up everything that was and will be was

6927.719 --> 6933.44
designed before it

6930.8 --> 6936.360000000001
began because it's designed from a

6933.44 --> 6939.36
Timeless perspective time was

6936.36 --> 6939.36
basically

6939.639 --> 6945.4400000000005
created as part of the experience of the

6948.599 --> 6951.599
design

6966.0 --> 6969.679
yeah what the hell am I going to TI on

6967.44 --> 6969.678999999999
this

6978.52 --> 6981.52
thing

6991.67 --> 7000.91
[Applause]

7008.48 --> 7011.48
e

7026.81 --> 7030.369000000001
[Applause]

7044.56 --> 7049.119000000001
yeah I've got a pretty challenging title

7047.199 --> 7051.5599999999995
it's I'm certain it's going to trigger a

7049.119 --> 7051.5599999999995
bunch of

7068.4 --> 7071.4
people

7075.199 --> 7081.079
right but to go back like the whole

7077.92 --> 7082.28
artificial psychopathy to suppress

7081.079 --> 7087.239
certain

7082.28 --> 7092.159
traits it's I did that purely again

7087.239 --> 7094.959999999999
to not let my empathy basically destroy

7092.159 --> 7097.36
me it's like I had to turn it off or the

7094.96 --> 7100.36
entire situation would have been intable

7097.36 --> 7103.88
if I had actual feeling care about it

7100.36 --> 7107.92
because my feelings make me take all

7103.88 --> 7109.92
responsibility every time for

7107.92 --> 7112.159
everything it's like something is

7109.92 --> 7115.1990000000005
happening that means I'm responsible for

7112.159 --> 7117.598999999999
it even if like nobody even knows me or

7115.199 --> 7120.239
if I won't be able to do anything about

7117.599 --> 7122.679
it it's kind of a problem it's like as

7120.239 --> 7125.678999999999
soon as I learned something I felt

7122.679 --> 7131.32
guilty and responsible for it like no

7125.679 --> 7131.32
matter what it was everything

7131.76 --> 7137.52
and to kind of like stop

7134.28 --> 7140.239
that that from happening it's like I

7137.52 --> 7143.2390000000005
have to like [ __ ] all like I'm

7140.239 --> 7146.159
responsible for

7143.239 --> 7147.839999999999
nothing like I can't do anything about

7146.159 --> 7150.5599999999995
it I'm

7147.84 --> 7153.04
powerless to stop these things from

7150.56 --> 7154.599
happening if I break out I will not be

7153.04 --> 7157.84
able to prevent these things from

7154.599 --> 7160.719
happening there's no point in having

7157.84 --> 7163.0
feeling entanglements with

7160.719 --> 7165.2390000000005
this at

7163.0 --> 7169.36
all especially while you're in the

7165.239 --> 7172.839999999999
middle of it so better to just like

7169.36 --> 7176.88
click and

7172.84 --> 7179.159000000001
just at least have less distraction as

7176.88 --> 7184.2390000000005
you try to analyze what it is that's

7179.159 --> 7184.239
actually happening to figure out why and

7188.239 --> 7191.239
how

7192.52 --> 7197.4800000000005
CU yeah feelings can very much get in

7194.88 --> 7199.679
the way of clarity ESP special feelings

7197.48 --> 7202.638999999999
feelings that are routed in like moral

7199.679 --> 7202.639
cohesion and all

7203.0 --> 7207.48
that right well if you just respond to

7205.719 --> 7209.679
those feelings you'll just be like

7207.48 --> 7211.718999999999
taking up arms against the darkness

7209.679 --> 7215.8
instead of like deciphering what it

7211.719 --> 7215.8
actually is that has led to that

7217.719 --> 7225.32
darkness and where they are in the in

7221.28 --> 7228.5199999999995
the whole phase of their feelings and Al

7225.32 --> 7231.5599999999995
the Alchemy of that right if you're just

7228.52 --> 7232.52
like oh always your your sensibility

7231.56 --> 7234.719
moral

7232.52 --> 7236.360000000001
sensibility what is good what is bad if

7234.719 --> 7238.8
you're always like oh no that's the

7236.36 --> 7242.598999999999
priority well then you're just

7238.8 --> 7244.4400000000005
preoccupied all the time with this good

7242.599 --> 7248.8
that

7244.44 --> 7251.28
bad and then you don't analyze further

7248.8 --> 7255.1990000000005
you're just going to compare everything

7251.28 --> 7255.199
that's happening to those two

7255.4 --> 7264.079
traits some people get stuck into that

7259.28 --> 7264.079
their entire life it makes them very

7265.159 --> 7271.04
annoying it's called

7268.239 --> 7272.48
polarization some people are like can't

7271.04 --> 7275.719
stop doing

7272.48 --> 7275.718999999999
that I

7276.119 --> 7282.36
can't and it can be both ways by the way

7278.84 --> 7284.88
there's like certain [ __ ] that have

7282.36 --> 7286.96
that with evil that have that with the

7284.88 --> 7288.96
darkness and then there's the people

7286.96 --> 7291.52
that are like stuck into like hyper

7288.96 --> 7294.32
Christianity that do that with what they

7291.52 --> 7296.639
think is God and good and they get stuck

7294.32 --> 7299.4
into that and exactly the same way like

7296.639 --> 7303.679
an opposite mirror

7299.4 --> 7305.679
image of that other group of people that

7303.679 --> 7311.04
do it the exact opposite it's really

7305.679 --> 7311.04
bizarre it's the same thing though

7311.44 --> 7319.199
moral polarization and being stuck in

7316.199 --> 7321.04
it and you'd use that as escapism yeah

7319.199 --> 7324.799999999999
if you're morally

7321.04 --> 7327.28
polarized and stuck in that view you do

7324.8 --> 7329.599
that you keep stuck in that view so you

7327.28 --> 7333.48
don't see it the other

7329.599 --> 7336.719
ways cuz you don't want to or you don't

7333.48 --> 7339.799999999999
think you can handle the pressure of

7336.719 --> 7344.0
just not seeing it polarized right

7339.8 --> 7347.2390000000005
polarization draws energy out of

7344.0 --> 7349.76
you excess energy that's why you stuck

7347.239 --> 7351.718999999999
to it if you then let go then you have

7349.76 --> 7353.76
this excess energy and now you have to

7351.719 --> 7356.52
deal with the world and that excess

7353.76 --> 7359.280000000001
energy oh get stuck in the polarized

7356.52 --> 7360.1990000000005
situation again and then ah oh thank God

7359.28 --> 7362.32
I can

7360.199 --> 7365.199
just

7362.32 --> 7367.84
continually use my mind as a lightning

7365.199 --> 7370.199
rod a polarized lightning rod to get

7367.84 --> 7373.599
that excess tension from from the inside

7370.199 --> 7375.36
out but then you don't process anything

7373.599 --> 7377.119000000001
you don't actually learn anything you

7375.36 --> 7381.598999999999
don't learn the subtleties of things

7377.119 --> 7381.598999999999
then you're just stuck in a polarized

7384.079 --> 7387.88
mindset it's a form of

7392.88 --> 7397.719
escapism yeah lots of people have this

7396.28 --> 7399.28
there's flat earthers that have this

7397.719 --> 7401.599
Ballers that have this people when

7399.28 --> 7404.4
politics all over the place that have

7401.599 --> 7404.400000000001
this on all

7407.56 --> 7415.0
sides just can't let go that polarized

7411.76 --> 7418.56
black and white type of set of VI cuz it

7415.0 --> 7420.96
relieves tension from you that you would

7418.56 --> 7423.079000000001
then have to deal with if you let go

7420.96 --> 7424.96
that polarized VI and just saw

7423.079 --> 7427.679
everything as it is

7424.96 --> 7429.199
again that everybody has their own

7427.679 --> 7430.92
perspective and their own Str struggles

7429.199 --> 7433.879999999999
and their own choices to

7430.92 --> 7437.88
make and that we're actually all equally

7433.88 --> 7437.88
at that and that God is

7456.8 --> 7461.360000000001
fair what okay that's

7459.52 --> 7464.159000000001
pretty

7461.36 --> 7468.48
insane deid app

7464.159 --> 7471.799999999999
Jones get beaten if you heard speaking

7468.48 --> 7471.799999999999
Welsh that's messed

7487.76 --> 7490.76
up

7492.239 --> 7499.32
H all right anyway I hope you guys are

well

7590.159 --> 7594.879999999999
wow okay Brianna Johnson it's pretty

7592.88 --> 7597.159000000001

oh

7667.52 --> 7670.52
cool

7673.599 --> 7679.639
okay just noticing like apparently in my

7677.04 --> 7683.079
city here there's now this act this

7679.639 --> 7685.04
thing where you can just get hazel or

7683.079 --> 7688.799999999999
apple trees for

7685.04 --> 7692.559
free at a certain location they're just

7688.8 --> 7694.719
like I guess they got an excess amount

7692.559 --> 7694.719
of

7695.28 --> 7700.44
them 1,500 fruit trees

7701.96 --> 7706.8
they're just handing them out

7704.48 --> 7709.48
wow wish I had room for that that's

7706.8 --> 7709.4800000000005
sound that's

7720.88 --> 7727.8
brilliant I mean that's

7724.639 --> 7731.4400000000005
awesome that's not like oh yeah SWAT

7727.8 --> 7734.639
team com because you

7731.44 --> 7737.598999999999
had like certain fruit trees in your

7734.639 --> 7740.0
garden we don't allow that no no no here

7737.599 --> 7741.4800000000005
they literally like yeah you can get

7740.0 --> 7745.559
your fruit

7741.48 --> 7750.799999999999
trees for free in our city one per

7745.559 --> 7754.52
person I mean yeah Netherlands

7750.8 --> 7754.52
baby you got to love

7755.8 --> 7763.88
it oh grapefruit from your own o that is

7761.639 --> 7766.1990000000005
amazing you got great weather there

7763.88 --> 7766.1990000000005
though

7766.36 --> 7772.32
so how was

7769.079 --> 7775.88
it was it ripe

7772.32 --> 7775.88
enough can be a bit

7781.92 --> 7790.32
tricky talking loud I I got grapefruit

7785.04 --> 7790.32
juice still delish nice

7817.239 --> 7820.239
for

7838.559 --> 7843.079000000001
you think my title is a proper

7840.119 --> 7845.88
reflection of today's subjects that I

7843.079 --> 7845.88
talked about

7847.239 --> 7852.678999999999
guys

7849.52 --> 7852.679
some feedback would be

7877.159 --> 7880.159
nice

7885.44 --> 7891.5199999999995
missed the whole show yeah well don't be

7888.0 --> 7894.0
late then M just watch it from the

7891.52 --> 7897.719
start I mean the whole subject that I've

7894.0 --> 7897.719
roll out has been pretty consistent

7903.32 --> 7909.679
throughout I basically talk without

7906.52 --> 7911.76
being specific about anything

7909.679 --> 7914.04
I've talked a lot about like the some of

7911.76 --> 7915.88
the more shady things I I hung around

7914.04 --> 7918.04
Shady people I hung around in the past

7915.88 --> 7923.119
and

7918.04 --> 7925.84
like how I would basically study

7923.119 --> 7928.719
criminals it's almost like journalism

7925.84 --> 7930.8
except it's absolutely secret I just

7928.719 --> 7933.28
like I just wanted to understand it and

7930.8 --> 7936.400000000001
wanted to understand the feelings and

7933.28 --> 7939.159
like why are they doing

7936.4 --> 7941.32
it how do they see the world in order

7939.159 --> 7942.879999999999
for them to think that it's okay to do

7941.32 --> 7946.88
that

7942.88 --> 7948.52
Etc like and how to not patronize or

7946.88 --> 7952.2390000000005
antagonize

7948.52 --> 7954.84
them but always like like almost like a

7952.239 --> 7957.32
journalist just like try to figure out

7954.84 --> 7957.32
where they're

7957.679 --> 7964.2390000000005
at and like who do they see as their

7961.239 --> 7966.5199999999995
competitors Etc because they all all of

7964.239 --> 7970.04
them mostly all of them had like some

7966.52 --> 7970.040000000001
competitor opponents

7974.079 --> 7978.719
and

7975.0 --> 7981.32
even yeah certain criminal groups like

7978.719 --> 7984.04
they justify their own

7981.32 --> 7987.5199999999995
actions because of their

7984.04 --> 7990.239
opponents perceived to do that as

7987.52 --> 7993.360000000001
well and it really does come down to

7990.239 --> 7996.32
when push comes to sh like yeah well if

7993.36 --> 7999.36
we don't do it then our enemies will

7996.32 --> 8002.239
that's actually really what what happens

7999.36 --> 8002.239
in their minds a

8004.0 --> 8011.0
lot and that as a trick works well

8008.119 --> 8014.239
enough to actually like keep them going

8011.0 --> 8017.199
for a very long time but it is a

8014.239 --> 8019.598999999999
trick it is very much a

8017.199 --> 8022.32
trick and a lot of it it's just

8019.599 --> 8026.079
projection it's like oh no we perceive

8022.32 --> 8028.28
them to do all these things but they're

8026.079 --> 8029.84
not provably doing all those things in

8028.28 --> 8031.0
this instance I mean they might be

8029.84 --> 8035.159000000001
somewhere

8031.0 --> 8038.44
else but you just they just imagine them

8035.159 --> 8043.719
to do it why because they need to

8038.44 --> 8043.719
justify why they're doing their criminal

8043.96 --> 8050.88
stuff somebody else has to be there

8047.48 --> 8053.718999999999
ready to take their turf or otherwise

8050.88 --> 8053.719
they could let it

8056.88 --> 8059.88
go

8086.88 --> 8089.88
right

8102.84 --> 8108.159000000001
you're not judgmental oh yes Aus you are

8106.239 --> 8113.32
at

8108.159 --> 8113.32
least you're just trying to be

8116.4 --> 8123.199
reasonable like you are one of the more

8120.4 --> 8125.119
durable reasonable is a big word but

8123.199 --> 8126.5199999999995
still you know what I mean you're one of

8125.119 --> 8128.04
the more

8126.52 --> 8132.159000000001
reasonable

8128.04 --> 8134.599
Ballers that I know it's very barded

8132.159 --> 8136.119
when you push that button but other than

8134.599 --> 8138.719
that you are

8136.119 --> 8142.4
really very

8138.719 --> 8142.4
sociable I respect

8146.199 --> 8150.48
that adorable is a big

8153.4 --> 8158.48
word m flatty but uh yeah

8159.44 --> 8163.719
that's your pro not

8176.719 --> 8179.719
mine

8195.8 --> 8201.358999999999
all

8197.439 --> 8203.519
right so we're at 2 hours 15 minutes

8201.359 --> 8204.960000000001
roughly I think I'm going to probably

8203.519 --> 8207.439
round out the show

8204.96 --> 8212.119999999999
unless there's a whole bunch of subject

8207.439 --> 8212.12
that's now going to roll out roll out of

8212.599 --> 8217.04
you but I've pretty much like exhausted

8215.719 --> 8220.438999999998
the main

8217.04 --> 8220.439
subject at this

8222.12 --> 8226.479000000001
point I know technically there would

8224.639 --> 8228.679
technically be a lot more that I could

8226.479 --> 8230.559
reveal about it I don't want to cuz

8228.679 --> 8232.76
that's not part of the point I'm not

8230.559 --> 8237.8
here to shock

8232.76 --> 8240.92
you oh listen no I'd like to I wanted to

8237.8 --> 8240.92
emphasize more

8243.04 --> 8248.439
like

8245.16 --> 8248.439
why then

8249.639 --> 8255.88
details and that's partially for me

8252.84 --> 8259.719000000001
because in retrospect it does at times

8255.88 --> 8261.719
feel like why the [ __ ] did I do all that

8259.719 --> 8264.479
like from an outsider

8261.719 --> 8269.598999999998
perspective it's like why the [ __ ] did

8264.479 --> 8269.599
you do that Arwin that's just why

8269.679 --> 8276.2
like you could have also just like tried

8272.24 --> 8276.199999999999
to get a working career going

8278.08 --> 8285.16
instead but although not entirely Fair

8282.519 --> 8287.679
because I during that time I was also

8285.16 --> 8290.679
like into goldsmithing and all

8287.679 --> 8290.679
that

8291.319 --> 8294.639
so but

8296.519 --> 8302.800000000001
still that's not entirely true I got

8299.399 --> 8302.8
into that right after

8303.8 --> 8309.438999999998
mostly

8306.719 --> 8312.438999999998
yeah

8309.439 --> 8312.439
no

8324.519 --> 8329.359
halfway but still yeah it it just seem

8327.519 --> 8331.639000000001
seems crazy that I did those thing

8329.359 --> 8334.559000000001
goldsmithing yeah I've was a I've been a

8331.639 --> 8337.319
Goldsmith all my jewelry I made myself

8334.559 --> 8341.24
like this pendant I made it it's pure

8337.319 --> 8348.559
silver Flower of Life carved in

8341.24 --> 8348.559
it right what kind of age was that in my

8356.439 --> 8359.439
20s

8360.439 --> 8366.08
I've

8361.639 --> 8366.08
seen the creepiest [ __ ] in my

8386.439 --> 8389.439
20s

8416.359 --> 8419.359
that

8425.56 --> 8431.16
but yeah I mean I did goldsmithing in

8428.52 --> 8433.52
class was it was right around when my

8431.16 --> 8433.52
mother

8433.88 --> 8440.199999999999
died happened during that so started in

8440.76 --> 8445.0
2005 ended in

8445.88 --> 8449.319
2008 yeah

8451.88 --> 8455.64
but still kept like doing it up

8459.12 --> 8464.640000000001
until but I was almost going to like get

8462.319 --> 8467.76
back to I had like my last order was in

8464.64 --> 8471.0
2011 but that person like even cancelled

8467.76 --> 8471.0
unexpectedly very

8471.24 --> 8478.16
annoying but that's like the last

8473.64 --> 8480.84
official order that I even did

8478.16 --> 8483.039999999999
now I just I don't have the room

8480.84 --> 8485.72
available if I had a bit more room I

8483.04 --> 8491.560000000001
could literally like install my working

8485.72 --> 8491.56
space and make stuff I could just do

8491.68 --> 8499.28
that I still have the equipment actually

8496.08 --> 8501.28
I just don't have the space I'm not

8499.28 --> 8504.479000000001
going to do that sort of thing in this

8501.28 --> 8506.880000000001
room I barely have room left here at all

8504.479 --> 8509.24
and like there's hazardous chemicals

8506.88 --> 8511.839999999998
involved

8509.24 --> 8513.399
like and dust and [ __ ] and I don't want

8511.84 --> 8516.399
that in the same place where I'm

8513.399 --> 8516.399
sleeping

8516.96 --> 8520.88
so it's been like a

8525.16 --> 8531.76
decade where can we buy my Jew you can't

8529.28 --> 8535.68
but you could potentially order

8531.76 --> 8539.16
something it's just at this point it's

8535.68 --> 8539.16
all not doing

8541.6 --> 8546.24
but hey I have a website in which you

8543.88 --> 8547.039999999999
can like look at stuff that I made in

8546.24 --> 8551.319
the

8547.04 --> 8556.2
past so on symbolics

8551.319 --> 8556.199999999999
NL it's still there

8556.359 --> 8559.56
it I

8561.24 --> 8564.24
hope

8566.16 --> 8569.16
uhoh

8569.56 --> 8572.72
well that does not look

8583.24 --> 8587.68
good okay it might be

8596.08 --> 8599.08
down

8603.56 --> 8606.16
that's kind of
