roommate is actually moving out so

105.78 --> 112.619
there's another guy coming in her place

109.83 --> 115.5
I think that's yeah it's the guy they

112.619 --> 118.459
basically she has a relationship with I

115.5 --> 118.459
presume

122.11 --> 126.22
yeah Cheers I got Tamara coffee and tea

125.5 --> 129.46
that's it

126.22 --> 132.4
I had an Illuminati cousin earlier but

129.46 --> 136.24
it was basically my breakfast and I was

132.4 --> 145.27
really hungry so but it was nice

136.24 --> 148.27
oh yeah Tesla Apple that's that's

145.27 --> 151.65
terrible yeah that kind of [Â __Â ] always

148.27 --> 151.65
makes a huge impact

157.45 --> 164.709
I don't know why you bring that up by

160.48 --> 168.22
the way but yeah I'm high I actually

164.709 --> 171.88
took a I got impulsive today and it took

168.22 --> 175.93
an alpha power now half an hour ago

171.88 --> 183.22
and I already feel it kicking in so I

175.93 --> 191.31900000000002
just feel very forward hmm

183.22 --> 195.459
so let's get to chat see yous there yeah

191.319 --> 199.89
Steve stone monkey 3 D 8 a.m. sir check

195.459 --> 199.89000000000001
off Daniel peanuts Clark

203.06 --> 206.35
Tesla Apple

208.069 --> 210.849
all right

211.0 --> 219.0
okay not sure if that's a funny joke

214.0 --> 219.0
Tesla Apple but hello Jeffrey bail

221.41 --> 231.019
yeah I see

228.349 --> 236.32899999999998
I had a weird conversation with some

231.019 --> 241.189
crows also it's it's funny I was like

236.329 --> 243.17000000000002
testing but yeah I try to mimic it but

241.189 --> 245.18
yeah and I'm not gonna try to make it

243.17 --> 248.20899999999997
sound exactly like the crow because my

245.18 --> 250.64000000000001
vocal cords can do that but I can really

248.209 --> 253.909
try to get the vibrations of it and the

250.64 --> 256.37
tone and the intonation and all of that

253.909 --> 260.209
right I spaced pay special attention to

256.37 --> 263.36
the sounds animals well my mostly birds

260.209 --> 267.199
make at that how they do it to try to

263.36 --> 270.41
figure out what they're doing and they

267.199 --> 274.40000000000003
actually responded this time and it's

270.41 --> 275.72
like you can read from their face what

274.4 --> 279.59
they're thinking about it and they were

275.72 --> 282.11
like confirming so I think they were

279.59 --> 285.04999999999995
basically doing a general who's around

282.11 --> 289.19
to check agreed which is a well the

285.05 --> 291.74
typical crowed nothing it was full-out

289.19 --> 293.539
but that's typical a crow sound I think

291.74 --> 296.539
they do with the check if everybody's

293.539 --> 299.539
there but then later I kind of tested it

296.539 --> 301.729
again after that was over and while they

299.539 --> 303.289
were just looking or yeah looking around

301.729 --> 308.44
for food and then they looked all

303.289 --> 312.38
awkward like that's out of place to do

308.44 --> 318.669
so there is like a co2 how they use

312.38 --> 322.28
their their sound how they use their

318.669 --> 326.44899999999996
their sound making and I'm just

322.28 --> 331.29999999999995
fascinated by that just a side study I

326.449 --> 331.3
guess and the more vocal behavior

334.32 --> 337.38
[Music]

356.09 --> 369.28
anyway so what's been happening let's

366.23 --> 375.91900000000004
remind me through the YouTube history oh

369.28 --> 380.11999999999995
yeah there was ball busters yes I I

375.919 --> 386.02
didn't watch most of it was just mostly

380.12 --> 386.02
John presentation was so great and

396.15 --> 401.63
oh yeah Oh Benjamin again was pretty

399.479 --> 401.63
good

406.28 --> 413.28999999999996
not there wasn't a lot of activity I

408.68 --> 418.22
felt concerning Flat Earth on YouTube

413.29 --> 420.56
yesterday except for all buses I see now

418.22 --> 423.23
that Martin littke also streamed but

420.56 --> 426.52
that was apparently during Owen Benjamin

423.23 --> 426.52000000000004
so I missed that

441.49 --> 450.28000000000003
I yeah look the issue is this seems to

448.09 --> 452.08
be the thing of the day it's like every

450.28 --> 453.78999999999996
time oh this person that's highly

452.08 --> 456.07
controversial makes this really

453.79 --> 457.57
elaborate presentation and then the

456.07 --> 463.06
other party says oh they got all these

457.57 --> 466.48
things wrong and then it really starts

463.06 --> 470.14
to feel to be honest like it's a filling

466.48 --> 476.5
of time is this really necessary

470.14 --> 478.9
all the time is it like people are

476.5 --> 480.79
actually taking a break from delving

478.9 --> 481.21
into new things so they just keep on

480.79 --> 483.48
reading

481.21 --> 489.06
now just go with the ballers and

483.48 --> 489.06
regurgitate all the stuff I don't know

489.1 --> 492.29900000000004
[Music]

498.15 --> 501.42999999999995
again

499.36 --> 508.53000000000003
I said it a couple of days ago I really

501.43 --> 512.89
want to find new ground somehow and yeah

508.53 --> 516.43
I'm hoping to find it I will look around

512.89 --> 519.5699999999999
on channels it's it's a little tough

516.43 --> 522.31
though because yeah before

519.57 --> 526.3000000000001
for example Patricia would typically be

522.31 --> 529.15
somebody that would tap into all kinds

526.3 --> 530.89
of new people and that was interesting

529.15 --> 534.13
because that was a good way to basically

530.89 --> 541.81
see what's out there and see if you can

534.13 --> 543.73
connect and yeah I like that I got I got

541.81 --> 545.8299999999999
to know quite a few people through

543.73 --> 548.02
Patricia's there but yeah she's no

545.83 --> 553.0600000000001
longer there now so it's it's a little

548.02 --> 555.25
tougher and I feel sometimes well let's

553.06 --> 557.9799999999999
just say how the earlybird show has been

555.25 --> 560.29
going and pretty well I think I'm doing

557.98 --> 566.1700000000001
fine much better than I expected to do

560.29 --> 568.75
for such a long time but I've gotten

566.17 --> 571.03
some really nice people and chat and

568.75 --> 574.3
some people that I feel are my friends

571.03 --> 576.31
and that thing with me that ask great

574.3 --> 580.0899999999999
questions and that even support me

576.31 --> 583.2399999999999
financially it's yeah it feels great and

580.09 --> 585.7
they have been growing steady but at the

583.24 --> 591.79
same time there's also just these amount

585.7 --> 598.9300000000001
of trolls that seem to be all coming in

591.79 --> 601.39
like new people and yet it's not just to

598.93 --> 607.15
me it's everywhere so there's there seem

601.39 --> 611.92
to be new fresh ballers trying to have a

607.15 --> 613.9
go for it on the scene and they seem to

611.92 --> 616.4499999999999
also be increasing it's really they

613.9 --> 621.87
they're just being encouraged to do this

616.45 --> 621.87
and I think also Google is part of this

628.73 --> 635.23
I control the position well encourage

631.64 --> 639.74
opposition they are funded they get

635.23 --> 642.29
great scores they get all the all the

639.74 --> 645.14
public dick yeah everybody that wants to

642.29 --> 647.39
find somebody like that will easily bump

645.14 --> 649.18
into them it doesn't work the same way

647.39 --> 654.02
for us

649.18 --> 657.91
you really gotta find via via and then

654.02 --> 660.61
ask and then you can find them because

657.91 --> 663.65
how many times has YouTube actually

660.61 --> 665.27
suggested a video of somebody a flat

663.65 --> 667.64
earther or something you've never seen

665.27 --> 669.4399999999999
before that was really interesting and

667.64 --> 675.89
like oh wow thanks youtube for

669.44 --> 677.84
recommending this new cool person the

675.89 --> 684.23
last time I remember that happened was

677.84 --> 687.14
probably in 2016 when like - yeah the

684.23 --> 689.57
second wave hit with YouTube

687.14 --> 691.34
that's when yeah when people like mark

689.57 --> 693.35
Sargent we really like oh my god it

691.34 --> 695.33
flattered it is exploding and everybody

693.35 --> 698.0500000000001
was getting really into the rage and

695.33 --> 701.36
then suddenly Google started to

698.05 --> 704.4499999999999
gradually screw around and also the

701.36 --> 707.12
really heavy political censorship

704.45 --> 709.97
against the rides started to rear its

707.12 --> 711.62
head simultaneously like before it was

709.97 --> 716.74
mostly verbal but then really the

711.62 --> 721.76
crackdown started to happen and this is

716.74 --> 724.67
yeah it's not helping so and I'm getting

721.76 --> 727.15
all kinds of signs from everywhere from

724.67 --> 731.7199999999999
the news from different talking groups

727.15 --> 734.72
that Google is just it's about to break

731.72 --> 739.4300000000001
up probably and I really wonder what's

734.72 --> 742.6600000000001
gonna happen to all of this all of this

739.43 --> 746.81
content who's gonna manage that house

742.66 --> 750.5799999999999
what rules will they unleash upon us the

746.81 --> 750.5799999999999
ones that take control

750.87 --> 757.05
and I'm kind of nervous about it because

754.589 --> 760.44
of course the new group will be under

757.05 --> 763.1099999999999
public scrutiny so they will be very

760.44 --> 765.6
correct not politically correct but

763.11 --> 769.29
actually correct but at the same time

765.6 --> 770.1
they might just decide well you know

769.29 --> 773.16
Flat Earth

770.1 --> 776.279
it really is generally hated on average

773.16 --> 781.1999999999999
more so we are gonna could actually now

776.279 --> 784.17
gonna what was first put on the the

781.2 --> 786.57
right-wing with a lot of enforcement

784.17 --> 790.62
because it is more mainstream thinking

786.57 --> 792.1500000000001
kind of thing hits a wider audience that

790.62 --> 795.99
they're gonna do something like that on

792.15 --> 801.3
Flat Earth instead of just discouraging

795.99 --> 803.85
it silently really like yeah these

801.3 --> 805.41
people are just like the leftists

803.85 --> 808.2
they're literally trying to turn the

805.41 --> 811.05
world inside out that kind of thing is

808.2 --> 813.62
already is like sneakily being suggested

811.05 --> 816.5699999999999
here and there and we got to be careful

813.62 --> 820.2
we got to understand how the whole thing

816.57 --> 826.08
will transit we are part of that transit

820.2 --> 829.98
and trust me controllers or people

826.08 --> 836.64
taking over the ring will have plans one

829.98 --> 842.63
direction or the other so also another

836.64 --> 848.31
reason why not to allow people to really

842.63 --> 851.4
get dirty and disgusting and evil on our

848.31 --> 853.8199999999999
site for whatever reason you know

851.4 --> 853.8199999999999
because

854.11 --> 862.0
there's gonna be decisions made based on

857.89 --> 865.029
a quick average glance of all us and

862.0 --> 867.519
maybe we will be individually picked as

865.029 --> 869.92
like okay good Apple bad Apple type of

867.519 --> 872.32
approach based purely on the behavior

869.92 --> 874.12
not on the content but we might just as

872.32 --> 877.1800000000001
well be taken for an average and it

874.12 --> 880.779
might turn out to look pretty shitty but

877.18 --> 885.4799999999999
that's because again the tolerant people

880.779 --> 889.42
the good ones tolerate the nasty ones

885.48 --> 893.6800000000001
it's a problem it's a universal cultural

889.42 --> 896.2299999999999
attitude problem that persevere in a lot

893.68 --> 898.66
of people naturally because it's been

896.23 --> 904.029
conditioned in throughout several

898.66 --> 906.88
different systems over the decades like

904.029 --> 910.35
yeah it's just the way the world works

906.88 --> 913.529
you always have to tolerate somehow

910.35 --> 916.5400000000001
because it's always gonna be know you

913.529 --> 920.5
wants you start approaching things

916.54 --> 928.029
universally like that yeah you will let

920.5 --> 930.55
poison in it happens by association even

928.029 --> 932.56
though you are passive it's gonna happen

930.55 --> 936.04
it's gonna rub off it's going to

932.56 --> 939.329
normalize because of the exposure so

936.04 --> 939.329
we've got to be careful with this

946.35 --> 951.84
mmm good Tamara coffee

953.37 --> 964.29
hey goodtimz for all i reckon our Stefan

957.97 --> 964.2900000000001
how Larssen dress Trish Blythe

969.15 --> 972.65
why do you guys think

977.1 --> 984.66
yeah tying it back into the beginning of

980.52 --> 991.47
what made me sat on in this yeah this

984.66 --> 996.54
view Flat Earth seems to be kind of in a

991.47 --> 1000.46
recycling mode for now but again it's

996.54 --> 1003.29
always been like that in a way so

1000.46 --> 1004.34
something new arrives you dig into it

1003.29 --> 1007.5799999999999
you get through it

1004.34 --> 1012.02
you go back to the default filler

1007.58 --> 1016.37
routine and yeah I don't like that I

1012.02 --> 1018.89
never have I I get saturated very

1016.37 --> 1022.25
quickly it's and this is a universal

1018.89 --> 1026.36
issue for me personally that's really a

1022.25 --> 1030.53
burden sometimes because when I get

1026.36 --> 1033.32
really energetic and I can't basically

1030.53 --> 1037.6
find something really heavy to dig into

1033.32 --> 1040.4299999999998
to apply myself it will start to get

1037.6 --> 1042.35
yeah everything will start to bore me

1040.43 --> 1046.1200000000001
and agitate me and I'll get very

1042.35 --> 1046.12
agitated and it's not good for anything

1048.58 --> 1054.35
so I'm kind of desperate into really

1051.59 --> 1056.75
digging into this new material but I get

1054.35 --> 1059.24
the feeling that others are still in the

1056.75 --> 1063.05
approach phase trying to let it sink in

1059.24 --> 1065.57
and I'm just too hasty so I'm here like

1063.05 --> 1067.76
and where is everybody taking so long

1065.57 --> 1070.9299999999998
freaking quantum mechanics let's go

1067.76 --> 1077.89
let's go let's go through every single

1070.93 --> 1077.89
experiment in discussions and in a way

1080.86 --> 1091.31
maybe a way to kind of start it up for

1085.99 --> 1093.8
now could be finding a good website that

1091.31 --> 1098.11
just has a lot of quantum-mechanical

1093.8 --> 1101.57
related experiments with visuals Oh

1098.11 --> 1103.9099999999999
group together in a kind of database

1101.57 --> 1106.07
format so I could just look through them

1103.91 --> 1109.8500000000001
and just look what it is they're doing

1106.07 --> 1110.81
and then share that that would be

1109.85 --> 1113.27
awesome

1110.81 --> 1115.25
but I have yeah I could basically do a

1113.27 --> 1117.95
Google search and just hope to find

1115.25 --> 1122.12
something but maybe there's others out

1117.95 --> 1125.39
there that do actually know a really

1122.12 --> 1127.58
good website or just have a self-made

1125.39 --> 1136.01
library of quantum-mechanical related

1127.58 --> 1138.98
things like the specifics and not a

1136.01 --> 1142.78
summary of general presentations because

1138.98 --> 1148.0
I do know that exists there's like

1142.78 --> 1151.82
online places where they're basically

1148.0 --> 1154.31
vast quantities of personal

1151.82 --> 1157.58
presentations from quantum-mechanical

1154.31 --> 1160.6699999999998
studies all with their own approach I

1157.58 --> 1165.1
saw this once in a presentation but that

1160.67 --> 1169.22
was just overkill and it was already

1165.1 --> 1172.1
steps beyond the first issues and I

1169.22 --> 1175.73
really want to basically get into the

1172.1 --> 1179.6
fund foundations really the things that

1175.73 --> 1182.45
quantum mechanics get to learn upon

1179.6 --> 1183.3799999999999
which they build their own opinions and

1182.45 --> 1187.25
reasoning

1183.38 --> 1189.8300000000002
just like Globus learn certain preset

1187.25 --> 1193.76
materials and then start to speculate

1189.83 --> 1195.35
based on those parameters so I don't

1193.76 --> 1197.48
want to I'm not really interested in

1195.35 --> 1199.76
somebody's niche quantum mechanical

1197.48 --> 1203.39
theory I really want to look at the

1199.76 --> 1206.45
foundations of it what is what are the

1203.39 --> 1209.39
claims what are the the phenomena what

1206.45 --> 1213.1100000000001
are the experiments and just go through

1209.39 --> 1214.01
them all one at a time and until

1213.11 --> 1217.52
patterns

1214.01 --> 1220.7
I'm a parent and then figure it out I

1217.52 --> 1223.28
can do it I just need the sources now

1220.7 --> 1225.95
that's pretty much what I need right now

1223.28 --> 1228.98
a good source so if anybody can find

1225.95 --> 1232.67
anything please let me know throw it in

1228.98 --> 1236.93
chat or yeah contact me on skype let me

1232.67 --> 1239.5700000000002
know there that would be awesome any

1236.93 --> 1251.24
input from ballers on this is also

1239.57 --> 1254.03
perfectly welcome what the abstract to

1251.24 --> 1258.13
that well well sorry I think I missed

1254.03 --> 1263.12
something there Figurski economics oh

1258.13 --> 1267.44
goody that's not exactly what I was

1263.12 --> 1270.25
looking for Theodore economics and

1267.44 --> 1274.94
psychology that is really interesting

1270.25 --> 1279.26
absolutely it is I to be fair I think I

1274.94 --> 1287.05
got a good a pretty good feel for it but

1279.26 --> 1289.85
that's not molecular quantum mechanics

1287.05 --> 1296.57
okay

1289.85 --> 1300.1699999999998
a physics book or quant quantum physics

1296.57 --> 1303.05
foundations that are like taken

1300.17 --> 1306.3500000000001
seriously and also if there are already

1303.05 --> 1309.02
in the foundation split splits like

1306.35 --> 1311.3899999999999
alternative theories then I definitely

1309.02 --> 1313.82
want to take a look at those if at the

1311.39 --> 1317.66
very foundation at what I don't know do

1313.82 --> 1320.48
do they teach a universal baseline like

1317.66 --> 1322.19
this is the accepted system and that

1320.48 --> 1325.85
there are alternatives or do they

1322.19 --> 1327.68
already present duality like options

1325.85 --> 1329.6599999999999
like it could be this it could be that

1327.68 --> 1333.55
depends on your approach and we're not

1329.66 --> 1333.5500000000002
certain how does that work

1341.78 --> 1350.78
okay okay saucy London molecular quantum

1347.6 --> 1354.1399999999999
mechanics by Peter W Atkins

1350.78 --> 1360.3999999999999
I hope there's then an online book for

1354.14 --> 1364.13
it and I hope that it's readable for me

1360.4 --> 1368.41
okay it is for sale for sixty four euros

1364.13 --> 1368.41
that's just freaking great

1381.91 --> 1395.48
now this yeah sorry it's got to be free

1387.44 --> 1400.39
it's got to be online otherwise I read

1395.48 --> 1400.39
Fame and demons online books

1404.04 --> 1411.99
yes I know sir check oh but the issue is

1407.37 --> 1414.75
is it really too difficult that's the

1411.99 --> 1416.96
thing if you're gonna go to a university

1414.75 --> 1420.51
and try to learn this you're gonna be

1416.96 --> 1422.82
put to the standards given by the

1420.51 --> 1426.36
teachers and everything that's been

1422.82 --> 1430.2
built into the system with it what I

1426.36 --> 1432.54
propose is to literally independently

1430.2 --> 1436.16
take a look at all the materials to see

1432.54 --> 1439.77
what it is they constructed

1436.16 --> 1443.4
independently so I am also going to be

1439.77 --> 1447.66
looking for trickery for machinations

1443.4 --> 1450.1200000000001
for presuppositions I'm literally gonna

1447.66 --> 1453.27
route back engineer it gonna attempt to

1450.12 --> 1457.1999999999998
and not get dazzled by all the

1453.27 --> 1460.3799999999999
mathematical giant frameworks that they

1457.2 --> 1462.9
created eventually not gonna look at

1460.38 --> 1467.8700000000001
that I'm gonna look at what they really

1462.9 --> 1473.69
did and how they came to the conclusions

1467.87 --> 1479.7299999999998
so I'm Daniel thank you for the tip

1473.69 --> 1484.26
Feynman lectures PDF I'll try that so

1479.73 --> 1486.9
see London yes you look what you can

1484.26 --> 1489.14
also do by the way instead of getting

1486.9 --> 1492.72
linked me up if you have like a file PDF

1489.14 --> 1497.3700000000001
that's not online send it to my email

1492.72 --> 1501.75
address and that's our win with IJ 33 at

1497.37 --> 1506.1899999999998
gmail.com because yeah that should be

1501.75 --> 1508.65
able to take a certain size file without

1506.19 --> 1512.31
a problem so I was just send it there

1508.65 --> 1515.22
I'll pick it up and yeah

1512.31 --> 1519.44
I'll read it I'm gonna look at your link

1515.22 --> 1519.44
now Daniel

1541.28 --> 1546.08
Wow

1543.65 --> 1547.8400000000001
that guy has such a sneaky look on his

1546.08 --> 1554.539
face incredible

1547.84 --> 1557.559
anyway mainly mechanics radiation and

1554.539 --> 1563.289
heat mainly electromagnetism and matter

1557.559 --> 1568.22
quantum mechanics hmm sounds good I

1563.289 --> 1570.919
think the the the first two parts what

1568.22 --> 1573.77
yeah after that comes quantum mechanics

1570.919 --> 1576.7700000000002
I think maybe the quantum mechanics

1573.77 --> 1579.62
might even be skipped mostly it would be

1576.77 --> 1585.46
very good to look at those first to see

1579.62 --> 1585.4599999999998
what that is oh Jesus huge

1592.89 --> 1595.97
holy [Â __Â ]

1604.89 --> 1613.98
oh [Â __Â ] all right I feel it it looks

1610.83 --> 1617.79
good the energy feels good it's written

1613.98 --> 1622.44
with attention in the right way I like

1617.79 --> 1625.5
it I like the way it's spaced this is

1622.44 --> 1626.46
good I think I will be able to absorb

1625.5 --> 1629.01
this material

1626.46 --> 1632.3700000000001
I'm literally scanning it purely on

1629.01 --> 1634.59
visual it looks really good I think I

1632.37 --> 1637.049
can read this but it is all God it

1634.59 --> 1641.58
reminds me that oh damn it feels exactly

1637.049 --> 1644.76
like in high school yeah at school it's

1641.58 --> 1647.549
like I'll [Â __Â ] join a giant piece of

1644.76 --> 1654.69
information it's gonna take some serious

1647.549 --> 1660.84
focus but I will this does feel like

1654.69 --> 1665.45
it's worth it I'm gonna I'm gonna save

1660.84 --> 1665.4499999999998
this in my bookmarks

1668.83 --> 1671.6699999999998
see

1675.14 --> 1683.6200000000001
yeah under physics

1678.149 --> 1686.4089999999999
right thanks Wow huge pile but I like

1683.62 --> 1689.35
the way it was written and that's really

1686.409 --> 1693.3700000000001
important to me like it matters a lot

1689.35 --> 1697.059
because that'll it it looked like it

1693.37 --> 1705.2399999999998
wouldn't throw up obstacles pleased by

1697.059 --> 1708.539
the format so I guess I have some

1705.24 --> 1712.1490000000001
education to do now

1708.539 --> 1714.279
maybe that's actually good because as

1712.149 --> 1716.83
I've been trying to share it's like I

1714.279 --> 1720.539
can't I got all this energy where what

1716.83 --> 1720.539
am I gonna do well maybe I just need to

1720.72 --> 1726.6100000000001
actually even use my brain harder than

1723.82 --> 1729.549
that I'm already doing maybe I can do it

1726.61 --> 1732.789
I've never really tried even to studies

1729.549 --> 1737.289
quantum mechanics because it always gave

1732.789 --> 1742.21
me a headache when I tried back then but

1737.289 --> 1743.08
back then I had much more confidence

1742.21 --> 1749.019
issues

1743.08 --> 1752.1999999999998
I didn't eat as healthy so maybe now I

1749.019 --> 1756.97
will be it will be perfect for me thank

1752.2 --> 1760.75
you for the tip it's better than just

1756.97 --> 1766.029
being agitated playing video games you

1760.75 --> 1768.779
know God if you want to be smart read

1766.029 --> 1768.779
every day I

1774.02 --> 1780.65
tersh Blythe I look that all depends

1780.68 --> 1790.98
because I am NOT a person that reads a

1785.01 --> 1793.41
lot at all I'm actually I was considered

1790.98 --> 1796.98
they thought I was really dumb because I

1793.41 --> 1799.5900000000001
hated reading so much that I almost act

1796.98 --> 1802.56
like that kid like no I'm not gonna do

1799.59 --> 1804.48
the homework cuz I hated reading the

1802.56 --> 1806.7
stupid books so they thought I was kind

1804.48 --> 1809.4
of stupid but then when the actual

1806.7 --> 1813.0900000000001
subjects were discussed with the teacher

1809.4 --> 1816.96
in the class I just step in and almost

1813.09 --> 1819.36
like a co-teacher basically read refined

1816.96 --> 1821.19
the actual explanation because I did

1819.36 --> 1824.4299999999998
freaking understand what was going on

1821.19 --> 1827.52
I'm just not good at reading I'm much

1824.43 --> 1831.21
better at the verbal tradition I can

1827.52 --> 1833.73
listen very intensely if somebody really

1831.21 --> 1835.47
knows their stuff and then kind of copy

1833.73 --> 1838.32
it really quickly with my understanding

1835.47 --> 1843.44
and I can also make things

1838.32 --> 1847.86
understandable to refine explanations to

1843.44 --> 1855.24
make them more tenable for others to

1847.86 --> 1856.7099999999998
absorb them so it was a weird time oh by

1855.24 --> 1859.65
the way thank you Earth is seriously

1856.71 --> 1862.05
flat for the $2 super chat donation love

1859.65 --> 1870.99
is teaching globe zombies how to test

1862.05 --> 1874.02
for curve is on yeah well for me what I

1870.99 --> 1877.95
do these days I really start to just

1874.02 --> 1879.3899999999999
explain it the horizon ships going off

1877.95 --> 1883.68
for the rice and everybody's heard about

1879.39 --> 1887.8400000000001
it that that's just not the case because

1883.68 --> 1890.49
that effect the visual phenomena is

1887.84 --> 1893.1299999999999
universal it always happens even when

1890.49 --> 1895.26
you look over a confirmed flat plane and

1893.13 --> 1897.63
then explain the mechanics observer

1895.26 --> 1900.45
height versus distance over that plane

1897.63 --> 1904.41
how concealment will start to take place

1900.45 --> 1905.23
in a linear relation of the observer

1904.41 --> 1907.029
height

1905.23 --> 1909.07
is the distance where the upstream where

1907.029 --> 1911.44
the concealment will start to appear so

1909.07 --> 1915.309
I really put it down very mechanically

1911.44 --> 1918.13
modeled were modeled with words I could

1915.309 --> 1920.2
make a very basic graph of it but and I

1918.13 --> 1922.8090000000002
don't care even about the numbers I just

1920.2 --> 1925.51
care to size up the empirical effects

1922.809 --> 1926.44
that's my interest I'm I'm not a

1925.51 --> 1931.21
mathematician

1926.44 --> 1934.8700000000001
I'm an empiricist I get the relations of

1931.21 --> 1940.179
math that's how I even graduated with

1934.87 --> 1944.3799999999999
math on the B side like serious serious

1940.179 --> 1948.94
math mechanics because I have a feel for

1944.38 --> 1951.0100000000002
it I understand what the effects are

1948.94 --> 1953.38
trying to do I have a feel for it just

1951.01 --> 1958.09
like I have a feel for how computer

1953.38 --> 1961.21
programs do their things but the actual

1958.09 --> 1963.49
dealing with the numbers just like the

1961.21 --> 1967.059
actual dealing with the programming code

1963.49 --> 1973.779
I'm not good at that and it's never

1967.059 --> 1976.84
really been able to stick I like the

1973.779 --> 1980.049
understanding it helps but I've always

1976.84 --> 1983.4399999999998
been kind of like pre-designed to

1980.049 --> 1986.46
function with somebody else that can do

1983.44 --> 1990.94
that and then just use my communication

1986.46 --> 1994.659
translation skills to basically unite in

1990.94 --> 1999.299
the task and then help improve the promo

1994.659 --> 2002.429
get Brad grammars thing with design

1999.299 --> 2005.549
that's what I do that's and I've done

2002.429 --> 2007.6200000000001
that a lot with friends and people and

2005.549 --> 2009.679
on schools it's always what I ended up

2007.62 --> 2009.6789999999999
doing

2020.58 --> 2026.82
all their ideas that that is fun but

2024.33 --> 2031.59
before I go into that I'll just go with

2026.82 --> 2033.81
these books because look one at one hand

2031.59 --> 2036.98
I'm kind of enthusiastic because it felt

2033.81 --> 2039.48
good it looked like a good written piece

2036.98 --> 2042.27
on the other hand it really feels like

2039.48 --> 2046.41
oh [Â __Â ] it's a big weight again so I'm

2042.27 --> 2048.42
I'm you will not see me tomorrow and

2046.41 --> 2050.9900000000002
like oh I accidentally read the whole

2048.42 --> 2056.79
thing that's just impossible could never

2050.99 --> 2059.1299999999997
manage that I'd be ill I'd be physically

2056.79 --> 2065.4
ill if I actually went through all that

2059.13 --> 2067.9700000000003
too much but I will get I will get on

2065.4 --> 2071.94
and probably take me a month maybe more

2067.97 --> 2073.4399999999996
if I don't start postponing it will kind

2071.94 --> 2076.05
of need to take a look at it at least

2073.44 --> 2079.17
everyday and just see how well it reads

2076.05 --> 2081.3500000000004
through maybe I will rush through it and

2079.17 --> 2083.91
I'll get through the week I don't know

2081.35 --> 2086.669
this is all basically useless

2083.91 --> 2088.3799999999997
speculation can only really tell when I

2086.669 --> 2093.95
start reading it so I'll give you guys

2088.38 --> 2093.9500000000003
updates but thanks for the link

2100.82 --> 2105.5800000000004
and saucy London yeah did the other ones

2109.6 --> 2112.96
maybe later

2120.859 --> 2127.91
well progress that's very to call it

2124.819 --> 2132.7
human progress I would call it just a

2127.91 --> 2134.839
lot of work a lot of development so

2132.7 --> 2138.6699999999996
there's a lot of things that have

2134.839 --> 2141.319
happened that they had probably had

2138.67 --> 2143.539
quite a lot of time to let it all sink

2141.319 --> 2145.5389999999998
in and you get the summary of it all so

2143.539 --> 2148.94
it's going to be a lot of intense energy

2145.539 --> 2152.9
that normally in linear time would have

2148.94 --> 2162.94
been realized and engaged in at a much

2152.9 --> 2164.42
more spaced way yeah but it's good

2162.94 --> 2170.239
thanks for that

2164.42 --> 2173.239
I'll give you updates and I guess it

2170.239 --> 2174.92
really comes down to hey if if you want

2173.239 --> 2179.539

I just don't deal well with with

2239.309 --> 2249.3590000000004
aggression although I've built up quite

2243.779 --> 2250.799
a tolerance for it but I don't yeah I

2249.359 --> 2254.549
don't go there

2250.799 --> 2258.44
I don't seek it out not anymore I used

no the sound is fine it's fine it's fine

2399.709 --> 2406.18
I think it was a distance to your mic

2402.259 --> 2409.069
thing but it's fine now okay right

2406.18 --> 2411.68
everyone in chat sound is fine I guess

2409.069 --> 2415.579
there may be an echo I seem to have echo

2411.68 --> 2418.969
issues that I don't hear sometimes on my

2415.579 --> 2422.63
side life but then end up hearing when I

2418.969 --> 2425.42
play it back so I I hope there's no echo

2422.63 --> 2428.109
Oh mark collar the collar is peanuts

2425.42 --> 2435.279
Clark its peanuts

2428.109 --> 2438.8289999999997
you know he's called in so many times so

2435.279 --> 2442.699
to kind of to kind of get back on flight

2438.829 --> 2445.779
earth I heard you mention Patricia

2442.699 --> 2445.779
Patricia Starck

2446.93 --> 2455.3289999999997
yes so I guess I like now after after

2450.799 --> 2459.2599999999998
listening to the I guess whatever you

2455.329 --> 2461.9300000000003
call it a paper that she wrote or

2459.26 --> 2462.1400000000003
whatever the thing is that can't be read

2461.93 --> 2464.93
out

2462.14 --> 2469.49
so I finally sat down and listened to it

2464.93 --> 2472.549
and it Aylee it kind of connected some

2469.49 --> 2476.5989999999997
dots for me because when I when I first

2472.549 --> 2478.49
got into this in 2015 I didn't

2476.599 --> 2479.42
understand why people were calling a

2478.49 --> 2482.5989999999997
shot man

2479.42 --> 2487.789
I thought she was gorgeous but she was

2482.599 --> 2490.4900000000002
really pretty yeah I agree

2487.789 --> 2492.7400000000002
so but anyway it kind of just connected

2490.49 --> 2498.14
some dots for me and I didn't understand

2492.74 --> 2500.39
why people were doing that and I was I

2498.14 --> 2506.71
was kind of I was kind of mad at her for

2500.39 --> 2509.5989999999997
doing what she did and what what was it

2506.71 --> 2513.38
well at first was she kind of just like

2509.599 --> 2518.079
left flattered you know I was mad but at

2513.38 --> 2520.76
least after after listening to to it

2518.079 --> 2524.42
it made me change a little bit you know

2520.76 --> 2527.0890000000004
I don't know it's quiet I guess I would

2524.42 --> 2531.92
but it was playing for a long time I I

2527.089 --> 2536.24
felt it on her like the last months that

2531.92 --> 2538.52
she was doing shows it was just over

2536.24 --> 2541.39
it's like she would have she was

2538.52 --> 2545.059
worrying a mask that had more attention

2541.39 --> 2547.49
because this whole stuff burdened her

2545.059 --> 2549.5890000000004
greatly and every time she tried to call

2547.49 --> 2552.2599999999998
out ever especially when multiple people

2549.589 --> 2554.69
were on a panel like let's please be

2552.26 --> 2558.1400000000003
friends let's not attack because she

2554.69 --> 2561.349
really couldn't take it like that really

2558.14 --> 2563.589
hurt her very personally and that it

2561.349 --> 2566.599
she couldn't grow skin on that and

2563.589 --> 2568.7889999999998
that's why I really think she left me

2566.599 --> 2571.579
just she just couldn't take it anymore

2568.789 --> 2575.15
it was too much pressure for her more

2571.579 --> 2579.04
than with other people because he was a

2575.15 --> 2583.57
very safe in a right in a way

2579.04 --> 2587.05
I try to look at both sides there's a

2583.57 --> 2592.69
couple other people that I listened to

2587.05 --> 2594.55
that said that Patricia was not very

2592.69 --> 2596.98
nice to some of the other women in

2594.55 --> 2599.8
flutters I don't know how true that is

2596.98 --> 2603.76
but one person in particular had a

2599.8 --> 2608.8
couple of bumping ends yes one person in

2603.76 --> 2611.92
particular was orphan red right I have

2608.8 --> 2614.32
really haven't seen anything to make me

2611.92 --> 2617.82
think that were from red is trying to

2614.32 --> 2622.77
deceive me really yeah

2617.82 --> 2627.28
not on the Patricia part okay well I

2622.77 --> 2632.109
look I checked out her she's been around

2627.28 --> 2635.44
for a long time but I think that the way

2632.109 --> 2640.93
she does things is through an act but

2635.44 --> 2643.51
she never not does that and and she has

2640.93 --> 2646.99
like weird she also has like these

2643.51 --> 2649.48
associations with Antonio su barrettes

2646.99 --> 2651.1899999999996
and they kind of feel like they do

2649.48 --> 2654.369
things the same way

2651.19 --> 2659.89
they're very merciless very very

2654.369 --> 2663.07
merciless and I I don't really trust

2659.89 --> 2666.25
orphan red like I kind of do think yeah

2663.07 --> 2668.7400000000002
like she does have like things that kind

2666.25 --> 2672.4
of are a little bit alluring for me but

2668.74 --> 2676.18
I don't yeah I'm always gonna keep a

2672.4 --> 2679.359
safe distance I tried to I tried to

2676.18 --> 2685.1499999999996
think of a couple things that often read

2679.359 --> 2687.64
could benefit from from saying that

2685.15 --> 2691.6
about openly saying that about Patricia

2687.64 --> 2693.94
in her live streams and that's the thing

2691.6 --> 2696.04
I can't like figure out like there's

2693.94 --> 2700.26
nothing that would really benefit her

2696.04 --> 2703.48
from distancing herself from Patricia

2700.26 --> 2705.82
and so I don't know it's behind the

2703.48 --> 2709.21
scenes rosie was with Oh me was this

2705.82 --> 2711.29
woman like why aren't you I don't know

2709.21 --> 2713.9
no but that's the audience no but

2711.29 --> 2717.05
that's look you gotta understand what

2713.9 --> 2719.36
the scene is what they're doing in a way

2717.05 --> 2723.98
they are kind of like choosing their

2719.36 --> 2727.04
audience and they like haters and

2723.98 --> 2730.73
there's a lot of them also among flat

2727.04 --> 2732.71
earth that really end up hating society

2730.73 --> 2735.41
very badly because of all this

2732.71 --> 2740.15
indoctrination and then they look for

2735.41 --> 2743.6499999999996
somebody to hate like a mob so it's like

2740.15 --> 2746.63
a political choice for your viewership

2743.65 --> 2749.89
that's what they do it's like politics

2746.63 --> 2752.6
social politics that's been going on

2749.89 --> 2755.15
from the start that started up pretty

2752.6 --> 2756.74
early with the whole swath of the the

2755.15 --> 2760.46
first wave in the second wave

2756.74 --> 2765.1099999999997
I saw it happen it was very worrisome

2760.46 --> 2766.94
and I always refused to engage in that

2765.11 --> 2769.3700000000003
kind of thing it's just horrific to

2766.94 --> 2772.34
politically choose to hate on somebody

2769.37 --> 2776.9
because there's a market for it

2772.34 --> 2779.3
basically right I actually will actually

2776.9 --> 2782.75
agree with you on that because you take

2779.3 --> 2785.78
that with the mixture of so many people

2782.75 --> 2788.15
on different levels because one person

2785.78 --> 2792.44
maybe woke to something that another one

2788.15 --> 2795.11
isn't and so that that that kind of

2792.44 --> 2796.03
makes that bridge to bond with other

2795.11 --> 2800.36
people

2796.03 --> 2802.21
harder I guess and I don't know I just I

2800.36 --> 2807.1400000000003
keep thinking about this one just like

2802.21 --> 2809.03
why is this consuming me why is why are

2807.14 --> 2811.8199999999997
all these people putting this on their

2809.03 --> 2814.28
channel you know I it kept popping up

2811.82 --> 2817.4
because also given what they're seduced

2814.28 --> 2820.34
its power its power in a new region look

2817.4 --> 2823.25
flattered this it's not something that's

2820.34 --> 2825.4100000000003
like officially claimed by a government

2823.25 --> 2828.5
there is no government Institute for

2825.41 --> 2830.93
flat earth information okay so it's new

2828.5 --> 2833.42
ground and all these people that are

2830.93 --> 2837.44
addicted to power bar but are not in

2833.42 --> 2839.57
control are seeking for power just like

2837.44 --> 2841.16
the controllers but from the bottom up

2839.57 --> 2842.63
so there's a lot of people out there

2841.16 --> 2844.68
they'll see wow there's this new region

2842.63 --> 2847.559
I'm gonna claim

2844.68 --> 2851.94
the king it's a game of Thrones in the

2847.559 --> 2852.3900000000003
flatter scene for them and they act like

2851.94 --> 2855.75
that

2852.39 --> 2858.569
every time that some of the people out

2855.75 --> 2861.029
there are like really trying to be the

2858.569 --> 2865.77
number one person that everybody listens

2861.029 --> 2869.069
to and they attack others viciously if

2865.77 --> 2870.72
they get criticized sure can I sweat can

2869.069 --> 2872.339
I switch gears a little bit cuz and

2870.72 --> 2878.16
listen our owner ask you something why

2872.339 --> 2882.47
don't you be honest the the thing that

2878.16 --> 2887.64
spurs chemos is bringing to attention

2882.47 --> 2889.89
about pressure right I kind of got a

2887.64 --> 2894.96
negative vibe from you like what's

2889.89 --> 2899.779
what's what's pushing you away from that

2894.96 --> 2903.809
so much why why can't you openly not

2899.779 --> 2905.579
concede to it but what can you like

2903.809 --> 2907.76
think about it or converse a door with

2905.579 --> 2907.76
it

2908.029 --> 2913.529
you let it slip that's how societies

2911.7 --> 2916.0789999999997
being arranged been conditioned to

2913.529 --> 2918.63
function it's like oh you want that job

2916.079 --> 2920.819
yeah you'll make more money but yeah as

2918.63 --> 2922.849
you know there's always a downside so

2920.819 --> 2925.89
you got to do this and then because

2922.849 --> 2927.809
every step you have to do something like

2925.89 --> 2929.67
that it's basically a conditioning

2927.809 --> 2931.65
function that wherever you go there's

2929.67 --> 2935.789
always a downside that you have to

2931.65 --> 2937.77
accept and that subconsciously slips in

2935.789 --> 2941.13
even in your personal life you'll start

2937.77 --> 2944.43
to then culturally automated accept

2941.13 --> 2946.92
people that also have weird crazy ideas

2944.43 --> 2949.71
or falsehood you'll just be tolerant of

2946.92 --> 2952.26
them but you won't stop them you won't

2949.71 --> 2954.48
address them on it you'll be protective

2952.26 --> 2956.579
of their incentives it's it's a liberal

2954.48 --> 2959.339
type of thing it's a liberal code of

2956.579 --> 2963.0890000000004
conduct and it's being conditioned in

2959.339 --> 2967.41
everyone through corporate society to do

2963.089 --> 2970.47
this so people accept it because

2967.41 --> 2972.27
everyone has issues that's already an

2970.47 --> 2974.6899999999996
old saying and it's true everybody does

2972.27 --> 2977.91
have their issues but now in this age

2974.69 --> 2978.48
everybody has issues and throws them on

2977.91 --> 2980.91
the table

2978.48 --> 2984.26
and start slapping people with it like a

2980.91 --> 2987.089
weapon now that's a different thing that

2984.26 --> 2990.2700000000004
happens now that didn't happen like that

2987.089 --> 2992.46
30 40 years ago nobody everybody

2990.27 --> 2995.16
wouldn't be embarrassed to go there now

2992.46 --> 2995.9
people do it like it's the normal thing

2995.16 --> 3005.5989999999997
to do

2995.9 --> 3009.829
open insanity yeah sorry yeah it's okay

3005.599 --> 3011.9300000000003
I don't know I guess I know you don't

3009.829 --> 3015.26
really like conversation about it I can

3011.93 --> 3017.839
tell by your comments and in chat the

3015.26 --> 3018.6800000000003
other day about what's moving moaning

3017.839 --> 3022.7599999999998
whoa

3018.68 --> 3026.1499999999996
yeah sorry I went totally railroaded

3022.76 --> 3030.76
over you but yeah our schema sure what

3026.15 --> 3034.4
what do you want to about that address

3030.76 --> 3037.82
just whatever whenever spurs was

3034.4 --> 3039.92
presenting his idea he I got a negative

3037.82 --> 3044.06
vibe from you like from reading your

3039.92 --> 3045.71
comments it's like it's like you it's

3044.06 --> 3049.339
like you didn't even want to consider it

3045.71 --> 3052.31
do you think about it all right but

3049.339 --> 3055.0099999999998
that's not like you like why you didn't

3052.31 --> 3056.9
get thought of the ligature then did you

3055.01 --> 3059.42
see my hangout yesterday and the day

3056.9 --> 3062.21
before I talked about I had yesterday

3059.42 --> 3065.42
and very early morning appearance on

3062.21 --> 3069.2
Jose's where I basically joined some

3065.42 --> 3074.38
ballers in well defending gas pressure

3069.2 --> 3077.39
against purse chemo because the the guy

3074.38 --> 3079.4300000000003
it's he's not doing something that's

3077.39 --> 3083.569
normal he's literally trying to

3079.43 --> 3086.93
indoctrinate like wizardry people that

3083.569 --> 3089.45
we don't experience gas pressure which

3086.93 --> 3091.0299999999997
is the beginning of every time he opens

3089.45 --> 3095.5989999999997
his argument and that's called

3091.03 --> 3098.78
indoctrination and he's very resistant

3095.599 --> 3100.849
yes it's a psychological project it

3098.78 --> 3103.7900000000004
feels like he's trying to experiment on

3100.849 --> 3107.03
the community to me so so so you're

3103.79 --> 3110.21
you're like you're like 100% like

3107.03 --> 3111.5400000000004
thinking that he's like a poet no I

3110.21 --> 3114.56
think that he

3111.54 --> 3121.08
engaged in a dark act of experimentation

3114.56 --> 3125.37
out of boredom and why he would do that

3121.08 --> 3128.99
well it's borders it's like a border of

3125.37 --> 3131.88
morality and dissatisfaction can people

3128.99 --> 3133.6499999999996
PP push people over that border very

3131.88 --> 3137.4300000000003
very easily if they're not trained to

3133.65 --> 3139.31
fight against that and I don't know

3137.43 --> 3142.41
maybe spur schema doesn't

3139.31 --> 3145.5299999999997
it's a typical yeah more leftist

3142.41 --> 3147.48
trademark if you ask me to be very

3145.53 --> 3152.07
easily going over that border out of

3147.48 --> 3159.93
boredom and I do feel like he is like

3152.07 --> 3162.69
that a lot just by his very lingo all

3159.93 --> 3165.06
right well thank you I just I could tell

3162.69 --> 3167.91
that you didn't like that one like you

3165.06 --> 3173.22
didn't like that idea presented it was

3167.91 --> 3176.19
cool because of the wizardry okay yeah

3173.22 --> 3179.1
look if he if he just said look I have

3176.19 --> 3183.0
doubts about this pressure like I

3179.1 --> 3184.68
basically had with gravity that process

3183.0 --> 3186.96
that was an honest process really

3184.68 --> 3189.12
believe in gravity trying to find the

3186.96 --> 3191.64
route somehow where it does it tie in

3189.12 --> 3193.8599999999997
where is the where does it really come

3191.64 --> 3196.0499999999997
in and then I figured out [Â __Â ] it's not

3193.86 --> 3197.67
there it's actually an aberration and

3196.05 --> 3199.5
then I figured out wait but all these

3197.67 --> 3201.96
forces what what is really happening

3199.5 --> 3204.6
then and then I back engineered it

3201.96 --> 3205.35
through relative density and that worked

3204.6 --> 3207.45
out great

3205.35 --> 3210.27
and now sparse chemo seems to be one

3207.45 --> 3214.85
thing to try something similar but with

3210.27 --> 3217.29
gas pressure but his entire approach is

3214.85 --> 3219.87
insane he's literally trying to

3217.29 --> 3223.49
cognitive dissonance the very concept

3219.87 --> 3226.47
out of reality trying to bypass it and

3223.49 --> 3229.77
fill up all the missing elements that

3226.47 --> 3232.6499999999996
come out of it with very flimsily put

3229.77 --> 3234.84
together ideas like who the temperature

3232.65 --> 3236.88
it's hotel temperature and then again in

3234.84 --> 3238.29
another sidetrack he just says no wait

3236.88 --> 3241.9700000000003
gas pressure that's gas pressure and

3238.29 --> 3245.19
then again now it doesn't exist it's

3241.97 --> 3247.5789999999997
spiraling out of control he has no more

3245.19 --> 3250.7400000000002
solid ground when he engages in this

3247.579 --> 3252.69
just like for example Brenda who does

3250.74 --> 3255.4799999999996
exactly the same thing in the same way

3252.69 --> 3259.98
with the same structural pattern and I

3255.48 --> 3265.65
have no idea why it seems insane to me

3259.98 --> 3269.64
that he does that yeah sorry for wall

3265.65 --> 3273.119
she goes okay again I think it's okay I

3269.64 --> 3274.95
think Brenda isn't in the same basket

3273.119 --> 3277.619
there I wouldn't put Spurs and Brittany

3274.95 --> 3279.1189999999997
in the same basket I'm not saying

3277.619 --> 3281.54
they're the same type of person I'm

3279.119 --> 3285.9500000000003
saying they're using the same

3281.54 --> 3289.47
methodology the same thought-out

3285.95 --> 3293.91
sentence structures to accomplish the

3289.47 --> 3297.1189999999997
same type of goals right they are aware

3293.91 --> 3299.31
of how to influence situations and

3297.119 --> 3301.1400000000003
people with sentence structures and

3299.31 --> 3303.44
approaches they've just very aware of

3301.14 --> 3306.06
that and they use it

3303.44 --> 3308.28
Brenda may be an idiot but she's just

3306.06 --> 3310.2599999999998
fully aware of that and constantly

3308.28 --> 3315.4500000000003
trying to abuse it constantly like a

3310.26 --> 3317.369
sport yes some stuff that she loves like

3315.45 --> 3325.5
try to flip around and hope you don't

3317.369 --> 3329.869
notice she enjoys or tricking people is

3325.5 --> 3335.849
acting very much like a small hat would

3329.869 --> 3341.4300000000003
right it is very strange like anyone out

3335.849 --> 3345.15
here that still defends the moon you

3341.43 --> 3349.43
know I don't know I questioned your

3345.15 --> 3352.17
intentions and that question here I

3349.43 --> 3357.02
guess your your research you know like I

3352.17 --> 3357.02
don't know I just what do you mean

3359.26 --> 3369.0800000000004
it's just service to me that like her

3365.2 --> 3377.5099999999998
shoe being a natural phenomenon because

3369.08 --> 3380.81
it's part of a universal spectrum right

3377.51 --> 3384.11
she kind of tries to twist it to where

3380.81 --> 3386.56
it's the shoe is the material from the

3384.11 --> 3392.06
earth which the Earth from the universe

3386.56 --> 3396.83
right that's called philosophical lego

3392.06 --> 3399.77
since she is literally trying to break

3396.83 --> 3403.04
the scientific method apart literally

3399.77 --> 3405.5
like cook snap the scientific method

3403.04 --> 3407.3
into and just go back to philosophy

3405.5 --> 3412.07
where basically anything is possible

3407.3 --> 3414.86
that's literally what she's doing but I

3412.07 --> 3418.1000000000004
you know I think really once once both

3414.86 --> 3420.86
parties respect the scientific method

3418.1 --> 3424.37
and agree upon what it is and the steps

3420.86 --> 3426.59
in it that's when the conversation can

3424.37 --> 3430.94
move forward it's it's almost like

3426.59 --> 3435.5
there's a block natural phenomenon can

3430.94 --> 3438.62
be a shoe and some of these folks Minds

3435.5 --> 3441.74
out here and that's it takes their

3438.62 --> 3444.5899999999997
respect on both sides does that make

3441.74 --> 3446.2099999999996
sense no because it's a

3444.59 --> 3450.26
misinterpretation issue is not a

3446.21 --> 3453.58
phenomena because very manipulated make

3450.26 --> 3457.1000000000004
it ain't not you and then issue again

3453.58 --> 3462.44
you know if phenomena is something you

3457.1 --> 3465.74
can alter like the phenomena itself so

3462.44 --> 3467.75
if it's just a solid thing yeah the only

3465.74 --> 3470.12
way to alter it is to basically break it

3467.75 --> 3471.53
apart or do something with it and then

3470.12 --> 3474.89
it's not going to be the same thing

3471.53 --> 3478.4300000000003
anymore so a real phenomena is like an

3474.89 --> 3480.71
effect and then by altering the effect

3478.43 --> 3486.2599999999998
you know you're messing with the cause

3480.71 --> 3489.31
of that effect that's it the phenomena

3486.26 --> 3489.3100000000004
is like an effect

3490.28 --> 3497.8100000000004
right but even even on both sides though

3494.79 --> 3501.5099999999998
because you on the fluttered side it's

3497.81 --> 3503.73
asked the question is what is your

3501.51 --> 3506.46
scientific evidence for the shape of the

3503.73 --> 3508.08
earth when really yeah that's that's not

3506.46 --> 3513.119
a correct question I know

3508.08 --> 3515.58
and so one side says she was a

3513.119 --> 3520.4100000000003
phenomenon and then the other one is

3515.58 --> 3523.23
asking for scientific evidence I don't

3520.41 --> 3528.48
know it's just it's not moving it's not

3523.23 --> 3530.82
moving forward right it was never gonna

3528.48 --> 3534.51
be proven scientifically that was

3530.82 --> 3535.53
conceded by the Flat Earth debate side a

3534.51 --> 3539.46
long time ago

3535.53 --> 3543.69
it's impossible right the only thing we

3539.46 --> 3548.01
can basically do is yeah find empirical

3543.69 --> 3550.17
data put it all together and basically

3548.01 --> 3553.01
go with an Occam's razor and the more

3550.17 --> 3555.51
data the better but it yeah as I

3553.01 --> 3558.7200000000003
speculated it could just turn out to be

3555.51 --> 3562.32
really surreal and then you're yeah look

3558.72 --> 3566.3399999999997
at all this conflicting reliable data

3562.32 --> 3569.81
why don't we do it now yeah and then I

3566.34 --> 3575.6400000000003
come in and say yeah it might be looping

3569.81 --> 3578.2799999999997
but it's complex and I think that things

3575.64 --> 3582.27
like science the scientific method are

3578.28 --> 3585.6000000000004
really meant for technology and earthly

3582.27 --> 3587.869
understanding of material it's it's

3585.6 --> 3591.69
really about the material mostly and

3587.869 --> 3594.96
electricity lights but the shape of

3591.69 --> 3598.53
Earth is something else it's just not

3594.96 --> 3604.58
the same thing the shape or yeah the

3598.53 --> 3610.0800000000004
form of our realm and what it is right

3604.58 --> 3612.09
and that's like really eight would it

3610.08 --> 3615.0
would it be would it be positive or

3612.09 --> 3616.53
would it be a good thing for this

3615.0 --> 3620.79
discussion to lead

3616.53 --> 3622.9500000000003
like for instance me led me into okay

3620.79 --> 3626.7599999999998
now I'm questioning why

3622.95 --> 3629.49
what is a human being is that the way it

3626.76 --> 3634.3190000000004
should go or should it stay you wanna

3629.49 --> 3636.3289999999997
apply science on yourself I mean what if

3634.319 --> 3644.94
what if the earth what if wherever we're

3636.329 --> 3647.67
in our own cannot be defined then it

3644.94 --> 3654.299
wouldn't exist it has to be defined by

3647.67 --> 3658.049
God doesn't it I'm talking about over

3654.299 --> 3663.77
over what authority does any man I have

3658.049 --> 3668.609
to say what a light in the sky is right

3663.77 --> 3674.43
it really can't be defined and why can't

3668.609 --> 3678.45
both sides admit to that because people

3674.43 --> 3681.18
don't like open holes of information

3678.45 --> 3683.1899999999996
that they can't fill they just don't

3681.18 --> 3685.0789999999997
like it that people there's a lot of

3683.19 --> 3691.98
people out there that can't handle

3685.079 --> 3694.319
mysteries in plain sight yeah it's

3691.98 --> 3696.96
really all filler it's all filler to

3694.319 --> 3698.339
give false confidence about everything

3696.96 --> 3701.9700000000003
else all right there's nothing out there

3698.339 --> 3704.7
for you to basically get freaked out

3701.97 --> 3706.109
over and lost in because you can't

3704.7 --> 3711.24
figure it out and you can't handle that

3706.109 --> 3714.089
you can't figure it out I think that has

3711.24 --> 3717.18
a lot to do with the therapeutical

3714.089 --> 3719.119
nature of the globe religion why it was

3717.18 --> 3722.5099999999998
used

3719.119 --> 3725.73
besides the scamming part that's the

3722.51 --> 3728.0690000000004
elitist advantage side of it but it's

3725.73 --> 3732.93
also the and like any religion it's a

3728.069 --> 3737.46
calming a soothing system to make people

3732.93 --> 3739.71
happy whether that be for delusional

3737.46 --> 3743.28
reasons or for yeah

3739.71 --> 3747.2
common sense acts that are laid on those

3743.28 --> 3747.2000000000003
people by their religion either way

3749.69 --> 3759.859
I don't know it's so it's just crazy

3754.76 --> 3765.8590000000004
it really is and I just kind of keep

3759.859 --> 3770.5
going back to like why wouldn't I like

3765.859 --> 3772.8089999999997
why why are we like so deceived on this

3770.5 --> 3780.349
what is it

3772.809 --> 3782.42
right and I guess I guess a lot of

3780.349 --> 3783.8900000000003
reason why someone doesn't want to

3782.42 --> 3787.67
concede that we have been lied to

3783.89 --> 3794.69
because then they have to accept that

3787.67 --> 3797.0
their [Â __Â ] meter is very low because

3794.69 --> 3798.2000000000003
they're gonna realize are they're gonna

3797.0 --> 3800.96
have to accept it

3798.2 --> 3805.43
they've been fooled and right in front

3800.96 --> 3808.76
of their their own self so you know what

3805.43 --> 3814.7599999999998
I mean experience as slick would put it

3808.76 --> 3817.46
yeah of course I had the least I don't

3814.76 --> 3819.98
know yeah that yeah that's sort

3817.46 --> 3827.539
that's the core thing that keeps it's

3819.98 --> 3832.22
like a the burden that prevents the what

3827.539 --> 3835.309
is it the the Stockholm Syndrome of the

3832.22 --> 3838.6699999999996
religion that prevents you from flipping

3835.309 --> 3839.7400000000002
around and yeah opposing it well it's

3838.67 --> 3844.099
just too painful

3839.74 --> 3848.18
so it's I've kind of kind of split off

3844.099 --> 3849.9500000000003
in two different ways with it so for one

3848.18 --> 3853.94
reason they're lying they're either

3849.95 --> 3859.25
lying about we're either we either have

3853.94 --> 3863.48
some type of creator or something or the

3859.25 --> 3867.309
second thing is I would say we live in

3863.48 --> 3871.609
something electric and we are being

3867.309 --> 3873.7400000000002
taken advantage of whatever we are we're

3871.609 --> 3875.779
born into this system and we're being

3873.74 --> 3881.8289999999997
taken advantage of knob

3875.779 --> 3885.519
they're trying well whatever we are like

3881.829 --> 3889.539
I don't know because I can only really

3885.519 --> 3893.109
be taken advantage of if you let them so

3889.539 --> 3894.6400000000003
they are trying it all the time when it

3893.109 --> 3896.2889999999998
really depends on your mindset if you're

3894.64 --> 3898.179
going to take that as a baseline

3896.289 --> 3900.9990000000003
assumption then you're ready placing

3898.179 --> 3903.7290000000003
yourself in a victim position well that

3900.999 --> 3905.499
doesn't help that but Arwen knew you

3903.729 --> 3907.3489999999997
when you were born you didn't really

3905.499 --> 3911.229
have a choice you were born into this

3907.349 --> 3915.039
right yeah well you always start out

3911.229 --> 3918.759
relatively defenseless that's just how

3915.039 --> 3920.7690000000002
it works and if you're really lucky your

3918.759 --> 3923.319
parents will be able to protect you

3920.769 --> 3928.7189999999996
until you wisen up enough that you can

3923.319 --> 3930.3089999999997
protect yourself mentally I guess I'm

3928.719 --> 3934.689
not I guess I'm not seeing it the way

3930.309 --> 3936.699
you are because I I see it as his

3934.689 --> 3942.4289999999996
pyramid-- worrying and or at the bottom

3936.699 --> 3945.429
and we're born in this system that we

3942.429 --> 3948.699
have to abide by it's like once we

3945.429 --> 3951.5190000000002
accept this whatever currency no we're

3948.699 --> 3954.099
at the top they're at the bottom they're

3951.519 --> 3955.749
just it's trying to switch it around in

3954.099 --> 3958.3900000000003
front of you and make it appear like

3955.749 --> 3962.1699999999996
they're having this amazing life they

3958.39 --> 3966.279
don't it's exactly the opposite they're

3962.17 --> 3968.7090000000003
just feeding on the regulars that are

3966.279 --> 3971.349
having a much better life than they are

3968.709 --> 3973.749
made to believe and they feed of that

3971.349 --> 3978.099
while they sit in their misery worrying

3973.749 --> 3980.89
about losing their power and trying to

3978.099 --> 3986.529
survive the hatred of what everything

3980.89 --> 3990.459
they cause out there yeah yeah that's

3986.529 --> 3995.859
part of the illusion it's exactly the

3990.459 --> 3997.749
other way around it's part of the

3995.859 --> 3999.999
fooling mechanism if you believe that

3997.749 --> 4002.5789999999997
that's like believing that Hollywood

3999.999 --> 4005.6989999999996
stars are like the ultimate goal of what

4002.579 --> 4008.569
you should be it's exactly they they're

4005.699 --> 4008.569
the they're trash

4009.77 --> 4024.86
yeah I would agree all right so it's a

4018.77 --> 4027.92
matter of perspective and try not to be

4024.86 --> 4030.23
fooled be remember that a lot of

4027.92 --> 4032.4500000000003
everything you deal with in the daily

4030.23 --> 4034.79
life whatever position of your

4032.45 --> 4037.04
conscience you fall back down to you're

4034.79 --> 4040.34
constantly in everything in every sector

4037.04 --> 4042.49
being exposed by this flip it around

4040.34 --> 4044.78
illusion where things are represented

4042.49 --> 4047.6299999999997
exactly the opposite of what they really

4044.78 --> 4050.119
are and it's really easy to basically

4047.63 --> 4052.88
automatically fall for that without

4050.119 --> 4058.2200000000003
realizing it especially if you switch

4052.88 --> 4060.83
your attention so it's like the

4058.22 --> 4063.7099999999996
enslavement of the mind can see if

4060.83 --> 4066.44
you're not in it well they give you the

4063.71 --> 4068.42
illusions when you are totally oblivious

4066.44 --> 4071.7200000000003
that they are illusions and that way

4068.42 --> 4073.55
they stick to the default position so

4071.72 --> 4077.8689999999997
even though you become conscious of it

4073.55 --> 4080.09
if you just lose your focus on us for a

4077.869 --> 4083.03
moment just let it go like relax then

4080.09 --> 4085.01
you may be inclined to by accident take

4083.03 --> 4087.5600000000004
it for granted again without even

4085.01 --> 4090.44
realizing it that you're falling for it

4087.56 --> 4092.45
again it's that's how it works it's

4090.44 --> 4095.0
because they got you when you were

4092.45 --> 4098.599999999999
completely innocent and oblivious of it

4095.0 --> 4102.02
and took it as real and that leaves this

4098.6 --> 4105.2300000000005
remnant in your subconscious especially

4102.02 --> 4112.790000000001
if you're young it's really difficult I

4105.23 --> 4117.44
fell back many times because of that do

4112.79 --> 4119.81
you uh do you ever do you ever like kind

4117.44 --> 4122.75
of consider that on something some

4119.81 --> 4125.200000000001
topics you may have a bias against

4122.75 --> 4129.67
flatter me

4125.2 --> 4129.67
yeah in what sense

4129.87 --> 4135.84
I mean are you just confident that

4132.51 --> 4139.68
they're selective ever I kind of look at

4135.84 --> 4142.71
some things and be like am i falling for

4139.68 --> 4145.29
something in my mi puttin faith in

4142.71 --> 4148.02
YouTube videos and you should never do

4145.29 --> 4151.43
that building my paradigm through there

4148.02 --> 4155.790000000001
I mean hey if you're gonna take their

4151.43 --> 4157.62
visuals or whatever their claims like

4155.79 --> 4160.26
this must be it if you're gonna take

4157.62 --> 4162.36
that as your replacement for what is

4160.26 --> 4164.1900000000005
being taken away when you realize Flat

4162.36 --> 4166.639999999999
Earth yeah then you're fooling yourself

4164.19 --> 4169.29
and you're probably believing a new lie

4166.64 --> 4173.67
but if you keep in your mind it's a

4169.29 --> 4175.5
concept we don't know yet and then you

4173.67 --> 4176.9400000000005
will probably like me get a little

4175.5 --> 4178.8
agitated when people keep on

4176.94 --> 4181.65
regurgitating the same thing over and

4178.8 --> 4186.0
over again without attaining the the

4181.65 --> 4190.469999999999
knowledge to confirm it so it's up to

4186.0 --> 4194.97
you as far as I am concerned I have just

4190.47 --> 4197.52
a I'm surrounded by a giant unknown and

4194.97 --> 4200.9400000000005
there's just a couple of things that I

4197.52 --> 4202.950000000001
know certain because I've been exposed

4200.94 --> 4206.3099999999995
to the empirical data that suggests

4202.95 --> 4209.58
these things the possibilities that are

4206.31 --> 4211.860000000001
present and I just tried to build from

4209.58 --> 4213.8099999999995
there on and I'm not like panicking over

4211.86 --> 4216.12
literally in my mind when I

4213.81 --> 4217.620000000001
conceptualize everything the physical

4216.12 --> 4222.18
reality that I know that there's

4217.62 --> 4224.64
basically a giant blank out there that's

4222.18 --> 4226.950000000001
really a blank as far as I'm concerned

4224.64 --> 4230.46
it could be all kinds of things and I

4226.95 --> 4231.83
have no certainty whatsoever which of

4230.46 --> 4235.53
those things it could be

4231.83 --> 4239.82
and I must accept that that is fact and

4235.53 --> 4245.09
I I don't want to be lured into jumping

4239.82 --> 4245.09
to a conclusion before I get more data

4245.719 --> 4251.449
you think like sometimes that's why I

4248.239 --> 4252.86
like it's it's almost like we're all

4251.449 --> 4256.419
constantly searching for something new

4252.86 --> 4260.119
like we want to know something new but

4256.419 --> 4263.919
it's just without resources and without

4260.119 --> 4268.179
reforms that's all we can do is

4263.919 --> 4268.179
observations and YouTube videos right

4269.019 --> 4273.9490000000005
yeah do you have do you have any other

4272.119 --> 4276.348999999999
ideas I mean while science whirring

4273.949 --> 4279.199
third a science that is part of our task

4276.349 --> 4281.63
it is re-engineering science trying to

4279.199 --> 4283.789
unravel all the ball indoctrination

4281.63 --> 4288.169
nonsense that's been unleashed upon it

4283.789 --> 4291.518999999999
like a cancer swelling or in between it

4288.169 --> 4295.159
and we are the ones to remove all that

4291.519 --> 4297.26
this is what I've been doing like

4295.159 --> 4301.339999999999
engineering gravity now I'm gonna

4297.26 --> 4303.979
approach quantum mechanics and more much

4301.34 --> 4307.309
more we are the real scientists

4303.979 --> 4309.409000000001
basically working from scratch leaning

4307.309 --> 4312.7390000000005
solely upon one another and the

4309.409 --> 4316.509999999999
multimedia possibilities instead of a

4312.739 --> 4319.968999999999
giant budget from a group of controllers

4316.51 --> 4324.88
that's what we're doing complete laymen

4319.969 --> 4330.979
grassroots well we definitely know that

4324.88 --> 4334.57
no human is going to space would you

4330.979 --> 4337.219
agree I don't know what's up there I

4334.57 --> 4339.499
don't know if we can't go up there I

4337.219 --> 4341.179
don't know if we won't go up there yeah

4339.499 --> 4344.599
but there's not gonna be a vacuum up

4341.179 --> 4348.999
there no matter what right right there's

4344.599 --> 4352.429
the gradient mayor go on for a long time

4348.999 --> 4355.61
or we simply just may be completely

4352.429 --> 4358.639
absolutely incapable of going beyond a

4355.61 --> 4361.4
certain height no matter what no matter

4358.639 --> 4363.38
what we don't know that's a matter of

4361.4 --> 4364.789
trying try and keep on trying until you

4363.38 --> 4367.76
get totally sick of it and there's

4364.789 --> 4370.789
nothing nude left to try so we don't

4367.76 --> 4372.889
know I don't know what NASA has been up

4370.789 --> 4377.449
to how far they've actually tested

4372.889 --> 4379.25
reality before being tasked to show the

4377.449 --> 4383.389999999999
fake reality they were designee

4379.25 --> 4386.15
to present I don't know how far the

4383.39 --> 4388.84
officials the real researchers have

4386.15 --> 4390.74
actually engaged I do not know I have

4388.84 --> 4395.38
suspicions I've seen some pretty

4390.74 --> 4398.3
interesting stuff through my visions but

4395.38 --> 4400.25
there's a big chance they simply halted

4398.3 --> 4402.14
research after a certain point and there

4400.25 --> 4404.21
are no longer concerned with it and are

4402.14 --> 4406.31
just going with all the data they've

4404.21 --> 4412.67
gathered in the last 80 years which is

4406.31 --> 4414.17
probably phenomenal amounts yeah and

4412.67 --> 4416.42
they just don't care about it anymore

4414.17 --> 4418.16
like yeah we don't care about what up

4416.42 --> 4419.99
there because the possibilities of what

4418.16 --> 4422.93
we discovered you can actually do down

4419.99 --> 4426.05
here that makes that completely

4422.93 --> 4429.43
uninteresting maybe that's part of

4426.05 --> 4434.51
what's going on I don't know find out

4429.43 --> 4437.990000000001
what did you were you curious to be a

4434.51 --> 4445.24
part of the the group that was going to

4437.99 --> 4449.0
area 51 no you are it's a complete dud

4445.24 --> 4450.95
been planted since the fifties you think

4449.0 --> 4453.08
that's a sigh oh yeah of course it is

4450.95 --> 4455.09
you really think there's another secret

4453.08 --> 4458.65
[Â __Â ] and that's gonna be known by

4455.09 --> 4463.79
anything of course not it's an obvious

4458.65 --> 4466.19
false mark and it's also to see the

4463.79 --> 4469.1
suggestion that there is secret

4466.19 --> 4474.0199999999995
technology going on it suggests secret

4469.1 --> 4475.67
power it's all part of the plan I was at

4474.02 --> 4477.38
work but it's there's nothing gonna be

4475.67 --> 4479.3
there if they have this secret stuff

4477.38 --> 4485.33
it's not gonna be there they're not

4479.3 --> 4489.22
absolute retards right I agree like

4485.33 --> 4494.47
they've it's almost like they built

4489.22 --> 4502.31
suspect suspicion around area 51 right

4494.47 --> 4505.6900000000005
they've intentionally put that it's all

4502.31 --> 4508.88
culture stimulants that is what it is

4505.69 --> 4511.808999999999
UFO culture stimulants if the

4508.88 --> 4514.0
storytellers to reinforce it to spice it

4511.809 --> 4515.969
and there's these locations and now

4514.0 --> 4520.719
there's it's just more organizing

4515.969 --> 4523.0
surrounding the UFO culture and that's

4520.719 --> 4527.7300000000005
another angle to reinforce a ball

4523.0 --> 4533.289
religion right I agree with you because

4527.73 --> 4539.709999999999
it reinforces space like people think of

4533.289 --> 4542.44
area 51 and obviously aliens and that's

4539.71 --> 4545.829
I think that's their biggest thing is

4542.44 --> 4548.53
just keep you thinking that space is

4545.829 --> 4552.489
real right because they're selling you

4548.53 --> 4555.099
on space that is made up they're making

4552.489 --> 4558.039
a phenomenal amount of money it's their

4555.099 --> 4560.9400000000005
little there golden ghost treasure book

4558.039 --> 4569.98
there's right it was fairytale book

4560.94 --> 4573.4
right Wow the Golden Globe did do you

4569.98 --> 4578.468999999999
think a lot of people are falling for

4573.4 --> 4581.039
the area 51 do you think that a lot of

4578.469 --> 4585.909
people are following their well I think

4581.039 --> 4589.599
probably not but because it of the hype

4585.909 --> 4591.789
it's just a curiosity it's like oh yeah

4589.599 --> 4595.4400000000005
everyone like oh if everyone's going

4591.789 --> 4600.309
let's go so I think it's just a

4595.44 --> 4605.0199999999995
curiosity like they want to just get it

4600.309 --> 4607.179
over with I think I don't know what else

4605.02 --> 4610.84
watch it seems very much like it's being

4607.179 --> 4614.02
hide so they are getting a lot of

4610.84 --> 4618.2390000000005
attention even in the mainstream so

4614.02 --> 4620.530000000001
that's just yeah telling ya like

4618.239 --> 4622.808999999999
obviously that the mainstream was

4620.53 --> 4628.059
talking about it and they they were like

4622.809 --> 4630.820000000001
showing clips of around the area of area

4628.059 --> 4635.469
51 they do they were like showing

4630.82 --> 4639.849
footage of test dropping test bombs

4635.469 --> 4642.4890000000005
right and when I was watching it I can

4639.849 --> 4644.619000000001
just tell that it was all scripted and

4642.489 --> 4648.369
all constructed

4644.619 --> 4656.679
make me have fear right to build the

4648.369 --> 4659.018999999999
story right and I could tell how they

4656.679 --> 4662.379
were scripting it to make it to wear it

4659.019 --> 4664.659000000001
it seemed real right kind of like kind

4662.379 --> 4667.78
of like was and the moon landing right

4664.659 --> 4670.419
if they didn't go then they didn't go

4667.78 --> 4672.699
back because buzz saw anything right

4670.419 --> 4678.07
it's it's that it's a tad alien

4672.699 --> 4679.629
dialectic they only give you two ways to

4678.07 --> 4682.299999999999
choose right yeah the fall is their

4679.629 --> 4684.399
Halloween monopoly they're both they're

4682.3 --> 4687.689
both in the direction right their

4684.399 --> 4691.719
benefit false dichotomy monopoly

4687.689 --> 4695.05
it's the Machiavellian like first rule

4691.719 --> 4700.8
trick pretty much false dichotomy

4695.05 --> 4702.369000000001
monopoly divert all power stride

4700.8 --> 4705.659000000001
mega-corporations try it

4702.369 --> 4707.978999999999
politics try it everything tries it

4705.659 --> 4709.898999999999
because it works so well it's just a

4707.979 --> 4717.189
very basic mechanism to fool your

4709.899 --> 4720.610000000001
audience and attain more power like do

4717.189 --> 4724.51
you do you remember the day that space

4720.61 --> 4726.429
force kind of knows oh god yeah I keep I

4724.51 --> 4732.099
don't know why I keep thinking about

4726.429 --> 4735.4890000000005
that but I just like what a shame like I

4732.099 --> 4737.439
can't believe people but now I think

4735.489 --> 4740.259999999999
about it and I just think that is the

4737.439 --> 4743.649
most outlandish thing I never heard

4740.26 --> 4746.1990000000005
Donald Trump say space ball but you

4743.649 --> 4749.519
don't know exactly what that program is

4746.199 --> 4752.469
designated to do right it's a very

4749.519 --> 4755.169
special hidden in plain sight super

4752.469 --> 4759.129
advanced and MKULTRA system for future

4755.169 --> 4761.559
plans you don't know this is high-tech

4759.129 --> 4763.419
stuff what they're probably gonna do

4761.559 --> 4767.169
it's not yeah these soldiers are

4763.419 --> 4770.05
probably gonna be subjected to things

4767.169 --> 4773.648999999999
that I have no idea about that they

4770.05 --> 4775.539
never expected maybe some of them will

4773.649 --> 4777.399
actually come walking out like this is

4775.539 --> 4779.07
total scam this is nothing like what

4777.399 --> 4783.719
they promised

4779.07 --> 4783.719
you don't know I don't know we'll see

4787.92 --> 4792.67
about to make another cup of coffee man

4790.51 --> 4795.039000000001
if you're gonna stay on the walk yeah

4792.67 --> 4798.639
sure yeah yeah yeah thanks for coming on

4795.039 --> 4805.239
man it's great it's cool yeah

4798.639 --> 4808.09
as Sunday sells off work today yeah man

4805.239 --> 4812.558999999999
nobody's calling everyone no I think

4808.09 --> 4814.860000000001
they are I think there's literally that

4812.559 --> 4820.360000000001
already there's like caravans already

4814.86 --> 4822.759999999999
going there I think and so they were

4820.36 --> 4828.909
like really gonna like scrape something

4822.76 --> 4834.7300000000005
out at home no it's I think it's more

4828.909 --> 4836.53
like a live event like a tricky event

4834.73 --> 4838.9
kind of like the same thing like NASA

4836.53 --> 4840.789
does it's an act but it's made to be

4838.9 --> 4842.98
believed to be real so it's gonna be

4840.789 --> 4844.268999999999
like any event do people how far are

4842.98 --> 4847.209999999999
they gonna go and of course they're

4844.269 --> 4849.909000000001
basically gonna find a couple of things

4847.21 --> 4851.769
that might be curious and then maybe put

4849.909 --> 4853.829
forward as trophies as what they found

4851.769 --> 4855.76
perhaps going to lead to new

4853.829 --> 4858.13
investigations maybe they find like an

4855.76 --> 4859.269
alien hand or whatever you'd have no

4858.13 --> 4861.219
idea what it could be

4859.269 --> 4864.55
or they'd literally find absolutely

4861.219 --> 4867.849
nothing and it's just like yeah say see

4864.55 --> 4870.579000000001
they weren't hiding anything because who

4867.849 --> 4872.650000000001
knows maybe the developments underground

4870.579 --> 4875.23
have gone so far that they literally

4872.65 --> 4876.449
don't want people to believe that's

4875.23 --> 4883.239
going on anymore

4876.449 --> 4885.879999999999
because it's becoming too hot maybe it

4883.239 --> 4888.61
could be all kinds of that's those types

4885.88 --> 4893.11
of events are always multi narrative

4888.61 --> 4898.119
multi-layer bigger projects with like

4893.11 --> 4899.92
secret plans for yeah secret education

4898.119 --> 4902.289
for people without them really even

4899.92 --> 4904.4490000000005
realizing it for future things that are

4902.289 --> 4907.509999999999
predicted to happen and then stare it

4904.449 --> 4909.518999999999
that's typically I think what the CIA

4907.51 --> 4911.25
spends a lot of time on figuring out

4909.519 --> 4915.3
that kind of thing

4911.25 --> 4918.51
I was like like using the algorithms to

4915.3 --> 4920.610000000001
to know what to kind of say nights or

4918.51 --> 4923.97
what to do right was darshan ago they

4920.61 --> 4927.21
analyze a person then that analyze and

4923.97 --> 4929.7300000000005
those analytics yield what the tip

4927.21 --> 4931.53
person does what he has been doing then

4929.73 --> 4933.389999999999
compares it to everything else and

4931.53 --> 4936.36
basically figure out what you're going

4933.39 --> 4938.79
to be doing what is absolutely natural

4936.36 --> 4940.65
and then also predicting what's coming

4938.79 --> 4941.79
through cross-referencing what

4940.65 --> 4943.74
everything is going on how they

4941.79 --> 4945.75
supposedly predicted future and then

4943.74 --> 4948.48
they just see oh he's going to respond

4945.75 --> 4950.28
like this this this and that when these

4948.48 --> 4954.0
things are going to happen according to

4950.28 --> 4956.0599999999995
the white prediction and then a lot of

4954.0 --> 4958.74
the times it's gonna be pretty spot-on

4956.06 --> 4964.47
because it is just the natural red

4958.74 --> 4967.17
reaction that's got being predicted and

4964.47 --> 4968.9400000000005
then then the influencing comes because

4967.17 --> 4971.37
this is the prediction before time and

4968.94 --> 4973.95
then the CME quite like okay we want

4971.37 --> 4976.2
this idea to go out there so we're gonna

4973.95 --> 4978.0
introduce that idea at this point when

4976.2 --> 4980.7
nobody's really that conscious about it

4978.0 --> 4983.25
yet because it's not being pushed widely

4980.7 --> 4985.55
and then see let's see what develops

4983.25 --> 4987.93
what people develop out of it and then

4985.55 --> 4989.79
reconfigure our prediction and then

4987.93 --> 4991.76
maybe some thing will come out of a

4989.79 --> 4997.65
person they will suddenly become very

4991.76 --> 5000.14
viable candidate for approach and that's

4997.65 --> 5003.49
probably what happened to Alex Jones in

5000.14 --> 5007.400000000001
my personal opinion is he is he still

5003.49 --> 5011.2699999999995
she still go yeah it's just not only to

5007.4 --> 5013.759999999999
know not for a long time now yes its own

5011.27 --> 5015.5
yeah his website it's still going he has

5013.76 --> 5017.24
his own servers his own programs

5015.5 --> 5021.41
everything is completely in his hands

5017.24 --> 5024.29
and and he's like throwing advertisement

5021.41 --> 5026.389999999999
like a maniac like like almost literally

5024.29 --> 5028.46
on his knees begging please buy my [Â __Â ]

5026.39 --> 5031.63
because otherwise I'm gonna go bust and

5028.46 --> 5036.64
the lawsuits and it's it's a crazy house

5031.63 --> 5036.64
but yeah I still try to keep track

5037.0 --> 5044.11
our number gonna make some coffee all

5039.28 --> 5046.929999999999
right two minutes and hey I saw the ISA

5044.11 --> 5048.37
ESA's in the chat oh you shut up to eat

5046.93 --> 5051.91
ya shot so easy

5048.37 --> 5052.949
hey ISA hey if ISA wants to join that

5051.91 --> 5057.28
would be cool

5052.949 --> 5059.65
he's a prude to me that I am NOT a child

5057.28 --> 5063.849999999999
about it babe

5059.65 --> 5074.44
and what's the right back no right back

5063.85 --> 5078.58
okay that's great it's good to have a

5074.44 --> 5081.37
back and forth especially once I finally

5078.58 --> 5085.87
finish watching over somebody else's

5081.37 --> 5087.94
point halfway made I always have to get

5085.87 --> 5094.87
that out of my system first before I can

5087.94 --> 5098.009999999999
have a normal conversation it's tough to

5094.87 --> 5098.01
get that out of the way you guys

5101.04 --> 5108.66
but yeah I love this conversations

5103.38 --> 5110.87
really good I hope you guys enjoy it as

5108.66 --> 5110.87
well

5129.409 --> 5132.339999999999
okay

5134.179 --> 5145.6990000000005
cool ah I'm gonna roll something hi Abby

5141.62 --> 5148.239
going for 1/2 hour yeah we'll see how

5145.699 --> 5148.239
long it goes

5164.38 --> 5172.63
so yeah anybody doing anything

5168.07 --> 5176.049999999999
interesting oh yeah talking about

5172.63 --> 5178.33
something I'm gonna do next week it's

5176.05 --> 5180.9400000000005
gonna be Friday or Saturday so the next

5178.33 --> 5184.78
weekend basically I'm going to visit one

5180.94 --> 5188.95
of my friends so I'm actually going

5184.78 --> 5190.9
outside of Utrecht wow it's a long time

5188.95 --> 5197.7699999999995
ago but I'm looking forward to going

5190.9 --> 5202.929999999999
there and yeah meeting her daughter so

5197.77 --> 5205.75
that's really really curious to see well

5202.93 --> 5207.52
yeah what type of person she is

5205.75 --> 5210.61
besides from what I've heard over the

5207.52 --> 5214.870000000001
phone and yeah that's gonna happen

5210.61 --> 5218.38
either Friday or Saturday I don't know

5214.87 --> 5223.2699999999995
which one it is yet but I'll keep you

5218.38 --> 5229.99
guys posted oh you say you have a band

5223.27 --> 5234.52
soon that sounds is not cool I was

5229.99 --> 5240.04
thinking about your your hatred towards

5234.52 --> 5243.280000000001
this quote mm-hmm and I kind of get why

5240.04 --> 5245.65
you kind of feel that way because when I

5243.28 --> 5252.37
first installed this court and I got on

5245.65 --> 5255.25
I was really turned off by it but it's

5252.37 --> 5260.43
always really turn mostly because I

5255.25 --> 5260.43
didn't know how to use it and so I

5260.82 --> 5264.58
understand why you don't go over there

5263.23 --> 5270.07
because I know a lot of people ask you

5264.58 --> 5275.0199999999995
and I know you want to conversate with

5270.07 --> 5277.78
other others obviously right but uh I

5275.02 --> 5279.990000000001
was just saying I get why you don't like

5277.78 --> 5279.99
it

5281.19 --> 5288.509999999999
mm-hmm yeah I know I just don't want to

5285.03 --> 5291.12
be forced to some platform like that so

5288.51 --> 5293.54
if people want to talk with me

5291.12 --> 5295.59
then let them come to me I have a show

5293.54 --> 5297.81
let them come to me

5295.59 --> 5299.79
why would I be forced to join some other

5297.81 --> 5302.13
platform because the people there are

5299.79 --> 5305.58
basically too lazy to approach me some

5302.13 --> 5312.4400000000005
other way I do I really want those types

5305.58 --> 5315.78
of people on my show you know right

5312.44 --> 5317.849999999999
that's how I I just don't like it

5315.78 --> 5319.62
discord I don't trust it I don't like

5317.85 --> 5322.26
the name and the first time I tried it

5319.62 --> 5324.98
out it wasn't just tough to work with my

5322.26 --> 5330.39
computer crashed really badly to

5324.98 --> 5333.03
reinstall everything so yeah it's a

5330.39 --> 5335.9400000000005
clear sign I already didn't want to do

5333.03 --> 5339.12
it and then when doing it being forced

5335.94 --> 5348.389999999999
to e reinstall my computer that's plenty

5339.12 --> 5352.11
of signals if you ask me I tried way

5348.39 --> 5354.030000000001
back when yeah when Patricia and Antonio

5352.11 --> 5356.2699999999995
were even still together so that's a

5354.03 --> 5361.5599999999995
long time ago

5356.27 --> 5370.2300000000005
these know those last time you spoke

5361.56 --> 5374.31
with it well voice the voice yeah it's a

5370.23 --> 5379.29
long time ago was probably on more than

5374.31 --> 5382.219
a year on Petes Pancho Pete's so that's

5379.29 --> 5386.15
probably like two years ago

5382.219 --> 5386.15
two years or three years

5387.83 --> 5394.53
yeah look we kind of just leave each

5391.29 --> 5397.86
other be because he knows I don't engage

5394.53 --> 5400.469999999999
in constant slander of him like he does

5397.86 --> 5402.66
for example with Patricia that's to do

5400.47 --> 5404.58
that I don't do that I just say like no

5402.66 --> 5407.04
I don't trust this guy this and that

5404.58 --> 5411.51
what I did not talk about it that's it

5407.04 --> 5415.89
and I don't know he he's been calling me

5411.51 --> 5419.400000000001
like a potato crew or all those kinds of

5415.89 --> 5422.04
things but it has so little weight so

5419.4 --> 5424.7699999999995
like if people care about that kind of

5422.04 --> 5427.38
nonsense remark and I literally have

5424.77 --> 5431.7300000000005
nothing in common with them so I just

5427.38 --> 5435.72
don't care and I'm panels he's not like

5431.73 --> 5438.45
face-to-face abusive you know doesn't do

5435.72 --> 5440.85
that it's very careful with how he comes

5438.45 --> 5443.639999999999
across it's only when people attack him

5440.85 --> 5446.85
that he starts to then try to turn it

5443.64 --> 5448.320000000001
around against those attackers but he's

5446.85 --> 5452.55
always been kind of polite in my

5448.32 --> 5455.25
presence let me ask you this do you

5452.55 --> 5457.4400000000005
think do you think the accusations

5455.25 --> 5459.63
against him do you think they're that

5457.44 --> 5463.919999999999
they're true what I can say Tony I

5459.63 --> 5467.84
really did yeah you haven't read it

5463.92 --> 5471.26
Patricia's all dead easy they raped her

5467.84 --> 5475.85
yeah why'd you have to say it out loud I

5471.26 --> 5480.39
was trying to read supposedly no but

5475.85 --> 5482.64
sorry but that you the r-word no come on

5480.39 --> 5485.37
what the hell that's just an act it's

5482.64 --> 5488.1
the act it's wrong if that's real and I

5485.37 --> 5490.23
think it's probably not real it was

5488.1 --> 5493.02
probably a defense as soon as she found

5490.23 --> 5495.719999999999
out that he went on full evil against

5493.02 --> 5497.910000000001
her that he was gonna tell her everyone

5495.72 --> 5500.55
you know she's a [Â __Â ] and basically

5497.91 --> 5502.41
slandered the [Â __Â ] out of her probably

5500.55 --> 5504.78
for no good reason so that's the first

5502.41 --> 5507.87
line of defense like a default my guy

5504.78 --> 5514.2
raped me a lot of women do that out of

5507.87 --> 5518.34
fear so I don't know it's probably not

5514.2 --> 5520.23
real but it's well for what he's done

5518.34 --> 5526.17
it's almost very much

5520.23 --> 5531.179999999999
- like so it's just it it's just weird

5526.17 --> 5534.09
because I think they're in a way I think

5531.18 --> 5537.06
Patricia never should have just went and

5534.09 --> 5539.39
moved to another country with some money

5537.06 --> 5540.660000000001
that they that they didn't know right

5539.39 --> 5544.200000000001
right

5540.66 --> 5546.57
she just winged it she explained that to

5544.2 --> 5548.639999999999
everyone like yeah I just right I just

5546.57 --> 5551.25
went and then it suddenly turned out to

5548.64 --> 5553.950000000001
be all dark and shittin and she

5551.25 --> 5556.68
regretted it a lot it really hurt her a

5553.95 --> 5568.98
lot that that happened okay she talks

5556.68 --> 5574.17
about that so just like boom let's try

5568.98 --> 5576.209999999999
that in a way I kind of did that with my

5574.17 --> 5577.9800000000005
own acts as well it's like the first

5576.21 --> 5579.87
time I've ever lived with somebody and

5577.98 --> 5582.23
just said like now screw it I'm gonna

5579.87 --> 5585.2699999999995
move out of my house out of my comfort

5582.23 --> 5590.25
safe zone and just move in with a girl

5585.27 --> 5593.25
for the first time ever just you just do

5590.25 --> 5596.13
it how did it go I mean how long did it

5593.25 --> 5598.26
last three years and it was freaking

5596.13 --> 5602.87
amazing and then suddenly everything

5598.26 --> 5602.87
started to flip around 180 degrees

5603.95 --> 5610.13
everything turned very dark very quickly

5606.98 --> 5615.5599999999995
what does she like start going crazy

5610.13 --> 5619.47
owner says she starts evening probably

5615.56 --> 5622.38
but I didn't care at that point I was

5619.47 --> 5624.21
just kind of like being obsessed on how

5622.38 --> 5626.1
am I going to keep this girl because

5624.21 --> 5632.61
she's kind of like out of my league as

5626.1 --> 5635.280000000001
far as I felt but yeah I did she

5632.61 --> 5637.73
probably did at some point but I was

5635.28 --> 5641.489
even kind of like willing to accept that

5637.73 --> 5644.339999999999
you know yeah it sounds really cocked so

5641.489 --> 5647.58
any retrospect but what was I gonna do

5644.34 --> 5648.92
like no I thought that well I might have

5647.58 --> 5651.86
tried that get

5648.92 --> 5652.37
angry with her but I was really scared

5651.86 --> 5655.489
too

5652.37 --> 5659.03
because this girl just entranced me so

5655.489 --> 5664.459999999999
much it's like I was just weird too

5659.03 --> 5667.88
scared to lose her all the time like

5664.46 --> 5669.5
even after she broke up with me because

5667.88 --> 5672.9490000000005
I still live with her for like half a

5669.5 --> 5676.19
year after that damn I just refused it

5672.949 --> 5680.0
that way but that was awkward yeah was

5676.19 --> 5685.989
it felt like I basically became a slave

5680.0 --> 5688.46
to her whims Wow okay so look I'm gonna

5685.989 --> 5692.419999999999
I'm gonna put you on the spot for a

5688.46 --> 5696.83
second okay if you if you've got the

5692.42 --> 5700.3
opportunity to say something to Patricia

5696.83 --> 5700.3
write down what would you say to her

5705.19 --> 5715.21
I hope she's doing okay and I don't know

5709.96 --> 5717.67
I think I well I really need to know

5715.21 --> 5720.37
more just about what like what is her

5717.67 --> 5723.31
inner decisions on it and everything

5720.37 --> 5726.219
Nathan hurt that I think here he had a

5723.31 --> 5728.650000000001
contact with her and some other people I

5726.219 --> 5733.54
wasn't included in on that so I don't

5728.65 --> 5737.199
know yeah what her attitude so about it

5733.54 --> 5739.2699999999995
is I don't know I hope she's all right I

5737.199 --> 5742.509999999999
think it would be kind of cool to see

5739.27 --> 5744.7300000000005
her return at some point if she would

5742.51 --> 5746.889
ever want to even do that again or maybe

5744.73 --> 5748.928999999999
it just it's too miserable it's too

5746.889 --> 5751.03
painful and she just literally is

5748.929 --> 5752.77
allergic to it now and never wants to

5751.03 --> 5754.929
hear about Flat Earth ever again it

5752.77 --> 5763.9490000000005
could be like that I don't know I don't

5754.929 --> 5767.909
know so a person that is very known in a

5763.949 --> 5773.138999999999
large group of people obviously mm-hmm

5767.909 --> 5777.909
and then that person deletes all their

5773.139 --> 5781.469
accounts because they were to eliminate

5777.909 --> 5784.96
all communications right they want to

5781.469 --> 5787.21
put this behind them right in the past

5784.96 --> 5791.77
they were out of their life okay and

5787.21 --> 5796.81
then what trips me out is as she's

5791.77 --> 5800.17
leaving this group of people she throws

5796.81 --> 5808.17
back this story and just leaves it with

5800.17 --> 5808.17
us what what story this whatever this

5808.23 --> 5816.968999999999
you know what I mean that yeah okay like

5814.239 --> 5819.669999999999
so what like well why do we need to know

5816.969 --> 5823.29
that right because that's the reason

5819.67 --> 5825.639
she's leaving whether it's him and

5823.29 --> 5828.88
everything that he's basically keep on

5825.639 --> 5833.6
pushing he probably that's probably the

5828.88 --> 5836.3
reason I don't know why does it matter

5833.6 --> 5838.52
I don't know it just it's weird to me

5836.3 --> 5843.35
because it's like what she wants to

5838.52 --> 5846.080000000001
forget about it but then obviously she

5843.35 --> 5850.46
wants us thinking about what happened to

5846.08 --> 5852.88
her - you know or she just incapable of

5850.46 --> 5855.08
letting it go and she basically

5852.88 --> 5857.150000000001
accidentally put it out there again

5855.08 --> 5858.98
because every time she thinks even

5857.15 --> 5860.87
anything about feathers that's the first

5858.98 --> 5862.459999999999
thing she thinks about maybe that's a

5860.87 --> 5864.98
problem maybe the problem is she can't

5862.46 --> 5868.03
get it out of her mind and she literally

5864.98 --> 5870.08
has to erase all memories and everything

5868.03 --> 5872.87
concerning it because every time she

5870.08 --> 5877.4
becomes automatically railroaded

5872.87 --> 5881.69
obsessed with this freak maybe that's it

5877.4 --> 5885.889999999999
I don't know Patricia is a delicate

5881.69 --> 5891.169999999999
woman and they're workings can be kind

5885.89 --> 5894.08
of complex it could be that some women

5891.17 --> 5895.88
are like that they they can get obsessed

5894.08 --> 5898.43
with certain negative things and then

5895.88 --> 5901.16
the only way for them to let it go is to

5898.43 --> 5904.7300000000005
literally drop everything and basically

5901.16 --> 5907.76
switch identities on the spot life

5904.73 --> 5910.15
identities what they do and for some

5907.76 --> 5913.75
women that's the only way to do that

5910.15 --> 5913.75
I've noticed that

5916.31 --> 5926.84
I guess it makes it easier to walk away

5921.7 --> 5930.86
from a whole book of lives that we

5926.84 --> 5934.16
obviously think are going on it's easy

5930.86 --> 5937.07
to just walk away from that when you

5934.16 --> 5941.99
have a big thinker to when you have a

5937.07 --> 5947.03
trust fund or whatever is it honestly I

5941.99 --> 5948.94
think it is because I thought that

5947.03 --> 5953.78
Patricia was in this conversation

5948.94 --> 5957.2
because she realized that we are being

5953.78 --> 5961.009999999999
enslaved you know in a way that is very

5957.2 --> 5963.05
cruel I think and I thought that she

5961.01 --> 5967.88
represented something that wanted to

5963.05 --> 5972.860000000001
break that and for her to walk away from

5967.88 --> 5978.68
it to be like oh I'm not gonna I'm not

5972.86 --> 5985.04
going to cry out to anyone that doesn't

5978.68 --> 5987.5
know about this lie she's gonna be a

5985.04 --> 5988.31
part of that lie it kind of feels like

5987.5 --> 5991.19
it away

5988.31 --> 5993.05
why are you wrong Lucien what oh so

5991.19 --> 5995.089999999999
you're gonna walk away from flattered

5993.05 --> 5996.77
that means that you literally sell out

5995.09 --> 5999.05
to the globe I find that kind of so

5996.77 --> 6003.570000000001
ridiculous assumption wouldn't work

5999.05 --> 6005.92
think about it if you're just gonna be a

6003.57 --> 6011.049999999999
flat earthers that never talks about

6005.92 --> 6014.53
fluttering yeah like me in public that's

6011.05 --> 6016.51
what I do what as a flat earther you

6014.53 --> 6019.15
have to talk about flat earth to every

6016.51 --> 6021.16
freaking person you'll get to know no

6019.15 --> 6023.32
but you're you're eventually gonna want

6021.16 --> 6027.4
to put yourself around like-minded

6023.32 --> 6031.0599999999995
individuals that allow you want to

6027.4 --> 6033.7
manage your your your life I'm not

6031.06 --> 6035.830000000001
necessarily looking for groups of people

6033.7 --> 6037.75
out there that I can hang around with

6035.83 --> 6039.88
that are flat earthers face to face I

6037.75 --> 6043.72
mean I'm not specifically looking for

6039.88 --> 6046.6900000000005
that that's not how I even have a social

6043.72 --> 6049.990000000001
life groups don't really work out for me

6046.69 --> 6051.669999999999
as I figure it out when I in the purse

6049.99 --> 6054.88
no interaction I'd much rather have

6051.67 --> 6059.37
individual friends and spar with them

6054.88 --> 6059.37
with ideas works but much better for me

6060.54 --> 6072.61
sorry I mean I don't have any or will I

6067.3 --> 6076.35
just like anyone that is out here I mean

6072.61 --> 6079.349999999999
she was on her channel telling people

6076.35 --> 6083.68
that we are lied to about where we live

6079.35 --> 6087.490000000001
and I thought that she meant it I

6083.68 --> 6089.59
thought that that's really what she

6087.49 --> 6093.5199999999995
meant what she wanted why doesn't she

6089.59 --> 6096.85
understand why Wow how could you walk

6093.52 --> 6102.46
away from this because she's freaking

6096.85 --> 6105.0
torture that's why if you're doing a job

6102.46 --> 6108.16
and you have people around you that

6105.0 --> 6110.62
literally hate you all the time and do

6108.16 --> 6112.69
everything to get in your way to prevent

6110.62 --> 6115.8099999999995
you from finding whatever you're seeking

6112.69 --> 6118.599999999999
in that job isn't that reason enough to

6115.81 --> 6120.52
walk away even though you had all these

6118.6 --> 6125.2300000000005
plans of becoming really good at that

6120.52 --> 6128.56
job you know not saying that's your life

6125.23 --> 6131.29
but I'm trying to compare it it it

6128.56 --> 6134.8
didn't work she was tortured or she

6131.29 --> 6138.82
wouldn't have done it just didn't work

6134.8 --> 6139.81
for her too much too much burden that's

6138.82 --> 6145.57
how it works

6139.81 --> 6148.120000000001
I don't get your soda if you walked away

6145.57 --> 6150.25
from look if I walk away from flattered

6148.12 --> 6153.43
if you're gonna do that to me then I'll

6150.25 --> 6155.71
lose respect for you okay I'm not gonna

6153.43 --> 6157.92
walk away from flat earth at least far

6155.71 --> 6161.2300000000005
as I'm concerned for the time being and

6157.92 --> 6163.87
with that I mean just the show but at

6161.23 --> 6165.879999999999
some point I might literally walk away

6163.87 --> 6168.849999999999
as well because I got really big plans

6165.88 --> 6171.52
and I just don't have time to focus my

6168.85 --> 6174.610000000001
mind on this stuff anymore at all that

6171.52 --> 6177.97
may come I don't know if it's not there

6174.61 --> 6181.719999999999
yet that I can see but it may come that

6177.97 --> 6183.400000000001
doesn't mean that I am then going hand

6181.72 --> 6183.85
in hand with the Glovers oh yeah you

6183.4 --> 6185.83
know

6183.85 --> 6188.17
what I'm over this flattered screw them

6185.83 --> 6191.0199999999995
who they're all bunch of retards they

6188.17 --> 6194.53
only fight among why would that mean

6191.02 --> 6199.780000000001
that if I just walk away that's that's

6194.53 --> 6203.29
paranoia sorry Patricius had nothing bad

6199.78 --> 6204.82
just said what it was she just couldn't

6203.29 --> 6207.46
take that [Â __Â ] anymore and there was a

6204.82 --> 6209.44
specific individual literally pushing

6207.46 --> 6212.68
people to bully her with the horrific

6209.44 --> 6215.74
things and that meme has persisted like

6212.68 --> 6220.33
a social meme stigmata for you for three

6215.74 --> 6222.5199999999995
years didn't die out you know I've had

6220.33 --> 6223.36
some pretty horrific memes unleashed

6222.52 --> 6226.75
upon me

6223.36 --> 6228.88
they usually died out after a few weeks

6226.75 --> 6233.62
well imagine these memes that have

6228.88 --> 6241.12
persisted for three years straight okay

6233.62 --> 6243.37
right right yes okay please I guess I

6241.12 --> 6246.28
know why I see what you're singing

6243.37 --> 6248.14
because it's not like she didn't try to

6246.28 --> 6256.45
stick it out three years is a long time

6248.14 --> 6259.51
and at least now I know why she was

6256.45 --> 6261.67
being called a training like cuz I never

6259.51 --> 6265.09
understood where that came from because

6261.67 --> 6268.12
I just when I first got into this that's

6265.09 --> 6270.01
kind of what I've heard around and I

6268.12 --> 6272.05
always wonder why and I always wondered

6270.01 --> 6274.18
where that came in at all and now

6272.05 --> 6277.54
lighting nozzle Antonio started calling

6274.18 --> 6280.54
her that no no no he's laid out false

6277.54 --> 6282.7
testimony for everyone and that

6280.54 --> 6289.9
persisted the meme forever and he's

6282.7 --> 6292.179999999999
never retracted it okay never that's

6289.9 --> 6295.03
right he started his really dirty yeah

6292.18 --> 6297.1
no she's dirty she was beloved people

6295.03 --> 6299.17
were literally jealous of Anthony

6297.1 --> 6300.910000000001
Antonio at that time when they had a

6299.17 --> 6306.9400000000005
relation and we're like oh wow

6300.91 --> 6310.84
look at that so dirty it is it is nasty

6306.94 --> 6313.87
it is psychopathic you literally just

6310.84 --> 6315.900000000001
chose to publicly ruin somebody's life

6313.87 --> 6319.26
with horrific rumor

6315.9 --> 6321.36
that are disgusting because every is

6319.26 --> 6324.06
everything that is he said he is true

6321.36 --> 6327.0
then he is a gay [Â __Â ] [Â __Â ] it

6324.06 --> 6329.820000000001
doesn't make any damn sense that he even

6327.0 --> 6334.92
said that he is insane and people still

6329.82 --> 6339.449
buy it it's sick so I guess in

6334.92 --> 6342.12
conclusion because some things he liked

6339.449 --> 6345.0
how you put it kind of at least it made

6342.12 --> 6349.26
me kind of at least she did stick it out

6345.0 --> 6352.53
and I like that in this thing that she

6349.26 --> 6357.6900000000005
wrote I like how she admitted her

6352.53 --> 6359.55
mistakes right she moved with a nut to

6357.69 --> 6362.37
another country with the man that she

6359.55 --> 6364.02
didn't even know she into a teen even do

6362.37 --> 6367.65
a background check on this dude

6364.02 --> 6369.929
obviously so that's the mistake that she

6367.65 --> 6373.19
made I liked her she admitted maybe she

6369.929 --> 6376.82
did maybe he didn't have much in there

6373.19 --> 6380.129999999999
you know he's just a guy pretty much did

6376.82 --> 6386.25
it's not like he's this public character

6380.13 --> 6388.8
or anything she probably did and there's

6386.25 --> 6392.219
just not much there like a guy has a

6388.8 --> 6396.9890000000005
daughter divorce had a couple of jobs

6392.219 --> 6398.85
that's probably it I didn't yeah she

6396.989 --> 6402.419999999999
doesn't ever like a record or anything

6398.85 --> 6404.6
so as far as I know maybe he does I

6402.42 --> 6409.83
don't know I don't care

6404.6 --> 6413.01
so basically during the three years that

6409.83 --> 6415.62
I I did conversate her with her in chat

6413.01 --> 6419.6990000000005
or compensate her with other people

6415.62 --> 6422.489
about her I defended her I I thought

6419.699 --> 6424.889999999999
that she was a beautiful woman I never

6422.489 --> 6427.678999999999
believed in anyone that you know said

6424.89 --> 6429.87
she was a [Â __Â ] I never never even

6427.679 --> 6433.56
considered it cuz I I could look at her

6429.87 --> 6441.09
and I could tell she's a beautiful woman

6433.56 --> 6446.370000000001
and I felt I guess in a way I felt like

6441.09 --> 6447.95
her dropping this and walking away in a

6446.37 --> 6449.93
way was kind of

6447.95 --> 6453.26
[Â __Â ] on the people over there we're

6449.93 --> 6455.6900000000005
out here supporting you because she left

6453.26 --> 6457.13
because people that weren't supporting

6455.69 --> 6459.919999999999
her obviously but what about the people

6457.13 --> 6470.66
that worked and I'm trying to see it

6459.92 --> 6473.11
that way this yeah if you're gonna be

6470.66 --> 6475.49
doused in conversations about Patricia

6473.11 --> 6476.66
supposedly conspiracy theories about how

6475.49 --> 6479.09
she's a training you're gonna be

6476.66 --> 6481.49
subjected to that for years then even

6479.09 --> 6483.8
though as you're defending it the energy

6481.49 --> 6486.5599999999995
is literally gonna rub off you on you

6483.8 --> 6488.09
until you are completely gaslighted into

6486.56 --> 6490.43
believing that it might actually turn

6488.09 --> 6494.3
out to be right even though they've

6490.43 --> 6496.79
presented nothing new for years that's

6494.3 --> 6498.68
how it works what constant exposure does

6496.79 --> 6500.3
it's what the ballers are hoping for

6498.68 --> 6501.77
with the Flat Earth debates if they just

6500.3 --> 6503.54
keep on repeating and repeating and

6501.77 --> 6505.910000000001
repeating saying the same thing with the

6503.54 --> 6509.15
same confidence despite everything it'll

6505.91 --> 6512.12
just rub off until we literally have no

6509.15 --> 6513.86
more choice but to just stop arguing

6512.12 --> 6516.68
with them and just allow them to say

6513.86 --> 6518.29
whatever the [Â __Â ] they want that's what

6516.68 --> 6522.08
they do

6518.29 --> 6524.45
speaking of effie debates are you are

6522.08 --> 6527.33
you gonna are you still staying off of

6524.45 --> 6532.429999999999
Nathan's panel yeah you are really

6527.33 --> 6534.32
you're sticking with her yeah have you

6532.43 --> 6536.240000000001
spoken to Nathan since the last time

6534.32 --> 6541.07
you're on the panel no really

6536.24 --> 6543.17
he doesn't speak to me we never talk

6541.07 --> 6546.08
over Skype even though I've had him on

6543.17 --> 6548.78
skype for like three years never talks

6546.08 --> 6551.24
to me he doesn't share info with me

6548.78 --> 6553.219999999999
talks to Randy and Riley and all that I

6551.24 --> 6556.78
think it never talks to me I don't know

6553.22 --> 6560.09
why he promotes show yeah he does

6556.78 --> 6564.44
but that's just general call a colleague

6560.09 --> 6569.78
Ness I think I don't know what it is I

6564.44 --> 6572.719999999999
just I just don't like the way the show

6569.78 --> 6575.15
goes and I don't like his decisions I

6572.72 --> 6578.0
don't like the atmosphere I feel I have

6575.15 --> 6581.749
nothing really to contribute and I'm

6578.0 --> 6583.549
just gonna end up intervening getting in

6581.749 --> 6586.549
and getting all attacked by everyone

6583.549 --> 6589.629
again for interrupting people because

6586.549 --> 6594.5289999999995
there's just nothing there for me to do

6589.629 --> 6599.869
just you know how you know how slick

6594.529 --> 6601.759
will basically he'll say that he doesn't

6599.869 --> 6604.0689999999995
have beliefs right and he'll put himself

6601.759 --> 6606.109
in a position to where nobody on the

6604.069 --> 6613.549
panel can hold him accountable for

6606.109 --> 6615.319
something right so in a way Nathan he's

6613.549 --> 6619.999
kind of he's kind of stepping to the

6615.319 --> 6622.789000000001
side as not being able to describe what

6619.999 --> 6626.539
the container is obviously but he'll

6622.789 --> 6630.559
enforce the gas pressure part of it

6626.539 --> 6633.978999999999
right right and so the antecedent yeah

6630.559 --> 6638.629
but that's a solid you can't get a more

6633.979 --> 6641.059
solid argument than that it's natural

6638.629 --> 6644.26
law based and that's real that's not

6641.059 --> 6646.599
some theoretical invention

6644.26 --> 6649.459
[Music]

6646.599 --> 6652.4890000000005
so yeah the container it could be a lot

6649.459 --> 6655.759
of things but it is a container because

6652.489 --> 6663.259
otherwise reality as we know it cannot

6655.759 --> 6666.559
exist in that form do you think John

6663.259 --> 6669.489
being on there so much as kind of gave

6666.559 --> 6672.889
you a bad taste about the show yeah

6669.489 --> 6675.3189999999995
because I wanted to kind of use all that

6672.889 --> 6677.539
basically what I do every time I engage

6675.319 --> 6679.339000000001
in a new project I do it on the debates

6677.539 --> 6682.129
and then I discuss it with other people

6679.339 --> 6683.599
if I'm gonna do that there with the

6682.129 --> 6686.299
thing I'm doing now it's just quantum

6683.599 --> 6688.759
erasers because here he goes he gets

6686.299 --> 6691.519
freakin clouzot blah blah blah talk off

6688.759 --> 6693.619
we know I won't allow him to answer the

6691.519 --> 6697.669
question no I'm not gonna let it I can't

6693.619 --> 6699.799
hit he did that several times every time

6697.669 --> 6702.379
I even tried to bring it up try to

6699.799 --> 6706.159
formulate it carefully even being modest

6702.379 --> 6711.63
he doesn't want to he just wants to use

6706.159 --> 6721.86
his stick claim Authority

6711.63 --> 6721.86
like he's so quick to like say something

6722.88 --> 6730.17
like he's so quick to put a person down

6726.34 --> 6733.719
run really it could it could possibly be

6730.17 --> 6736.6
that the person that he is dialoguing

6733.719 --> 6740.67
with they're just defending what they

6736.6 --> 6743.1990000000005
were taught and it's not their fault

6740.67 --> 6748.21
calling them a [Â __Â ] or calling them a

6743.199 --> 6750.428999999999
clown you know how it goes like what if

6748.21 --> 6753.81
the person on the other end is genuine

6750.429 --> 6756.969
just defending what they were taught and

6753.81 --> 6759.06
all he can do is put him down well right

6756.969 --> 6762.96
it's very simple he doesn't care

6759.06 --> 6765.610000000001
and he's expressed that very openly and

6762.96 --> 6770.83
relentlessly doesn't care he doesn't

6765.61 --> 6773.29
care about them if you don't say it

6770.83 --> 6776.469
right if you're indoctrinated wrong and

6773.29 --> 6778.57
you don't respond directly to correction

6776.469 --> 6780.34
you're a clown it's a waste of his time

6778.57 --> 6784.11
and he's just gonna get angry and

6780.34 --> 6784.110000000001
overrun with you until you go away I

6785.429 --> 6793.78
noticed the other day someone made a

6788.86 --> 6797.29
comment and he was overwhelmed by it

6793.78 --> 6800.949
John was he was so overwhelmed that he

6797.29 --> 6804.67
actually like left and then buddy came

6800.949 --> 6807.879999999999
back right and I started thinking about

6804.67 --> 6809.62
it and I was like you know if if you're

6807.88 --> 6813.21
out here and if you're not having fun

6809.62 --> 6817.12
right then your intentions can't be good

6813.21 --> 6821.199
right if you're getting that mad getting

6817.12 --> 6825.61
that miserable over a comment discussing

6821.199 --> 6829.53
flatter then you need a break or need to

6825.61 --> 6829.53
change your approach would you agree

6831.87 --> 6840.61
you know it's kind of like it's kind of

6835.51 --> 6842.889
like Esau is like well like ISA puts it

6840.61 --> 6844.8099999999995
in a way like if you're in flat earth

6842.889 --> 6848.08
and if you're not having fought if this

6844.81 --> 6849.1900000000005
is not funding then you're not doing it

6848.08 --> 6852.57
right all right

6849.19 --> 6858.57
or maybe it is fun to him and he just

6852.57 --> 6861.61
says like it's not I think John enjoys

6858.57 --> 6863.59
raging and attacking people a lot I

6861.61 --> 6865.69
think he's probably addicted to it or he

6863.59 --> 6871.51
wouldn't be doing it all the time to

6865.69 --> 6873.61
everyone yeah it's weird like it's ever

6871.51 --> 6876.969
noticed that John doesn't have actual

6873.61 --> 6879.67
friends yeah it doesn't treat anyone

6876.969 --> 6882.159
like a friend you ever noticed that

6879.67 --> 6884.26
treats people like colleagues and as

6882.159 --> 6887.98
soon as you follow a line your sub lead

6884.26 --> 6892.150000000001
no better than the dirty walks on it's

6887.98 --> 6895.44
not how you treat friends ever right you

6892.15 --> 6899.92
ever notice how I like he'll never just

6895.44 --> 6901.599999999999
openly say something uplifting right

6899.92 --> 6904.4800000000005
the only time he'll say something

6901.6 --> 6907.4800000000005
uplifting is if he's asked a question

6904.48 --> 6911.169999999999
and he's responding to it nothing just

6907.48 --> 6915.909
naturally comes from his lips that is

6911.17 --> 6919.36
uplifting it's it's so negative yeah I

6915.909 --> 6922.989
don't know yeah what is I

6919.36 --> 6925.5599999999995
I guess Nathan doesn't really care about

6922.989 --> 6928.0
the way he sounds when a way comes off

6925.56 --> 6931.6
Nathan just wants some money to be right

6928.0 --> 6935.26
and I'll admit I can't get bunk John I

6931.6 --> 6940.84
can't debunk him I don't agree with him

6935.26 --> 6945.46
about the Christian aspect but I can't

6940.84 --> 6947.83
debunk him I mean can you oh well look I

6945.46 --> 6949.78
think that the banking him is mostly

6947.83 --> 6951.969
gonna be overcoming the spell of

6949.78 --> 6954.82
confidence that he constructed so well

6951.969 --> 6956.889
with his oversight of the mechanics

6954.82 --> 6958.949
because there's a lot of wizardry in

6956.889 --> 6963.67
what he does a lot

6958.949 --> 6965.0
he is constantly pushing the railroad of

6963.67 --> 6968.03
his

6965.0 --> 6973.42
confidence that's what he uses as a toe

6968.03 --> 6976.009999999999
tag or as a a draw net you drag along

6973.42 --> 6978.77
that's what he does constantly putting

6976.01 --> 6981.68
on this confidence act and that's then

6978.77 --> 6984.31
he starts to apply mechanics it's not

6981.68 --> 6987.29
like it's all perfect and he basically

6984.31 --> 6989.84
pushes things and let you absorb some of

6987.29 --> 6991.73
it it roughly makes sense it's simple

6989.84 --> 6993.68
enough that it seems like it could be

6991.73 --> 6996.86
real as no trickery and then he moves

6993.68 --> 6999.490000000001
the screen to just stupid clown you're

6996.86 --> 7005.29
an idiot and he leaves those on longer

6999.49 --> 7008.23
so you don't get to really see the the

7005.29 --> 7010.57
minor details of what yeah it's very

7008.23 --> 7012.58
hard to find the holes in something when

7010.57 --> 7014.88
he's constantly covering it up with his

7012.58 --> 7017.86
attitude and that's what he's always

7014.88 --> 7019.900000000001
doing if you can find a single

7017.86 --> 7021.969999999999
presentation that does not contain a

7019.9 --> 7026.259999999999
significant portion of the time of the

7021.97 --> 7027.97
video with attitude then you got to call

7026.26 --> 7033.7
me because that's a eunuch

7027.97 --> 7036.1900000000005
that's a eunuch um yeah I agree it's

7033.7 --> 7037.45
like it's part of the Act it's part of

7036.19 --> 7041.11
the trick it's part of the design

7037.45 --> 7044.44
mechanism of what he does do it is an

7041.11 --> 7047.53
integral part of what he makes if if

7044.44 --> 7051.219999999999
what you're presenting is the truth

7047.53 --> 7053.74
right if your information you're it's

7051.22 --> 7056.02
all database see that's what I hear data

7053.74 --> 7058.54
yeah that's a good one that's your data

7056.02 --> 7063.43
so what I see if it's and I see if it's

7058.54 --> 7067.24
uh if it's the truth right you would

7063.43 --> 7069.34
never have to degrade you're the person

7067.24 --> 7071.79
you're conversing with or debating with

7069.34 --> 7076.650000000001
right you wouldn't have to say anything

7071.79 --> 7079.48
about him right and like those little

7076.65 --> 7081.79
those little insults that he throws in

7079.48 --> 7082.9
there sometimes I just find it really

7081.79 --> 7085.66
unnecessary

7082.9 --> 7087.94
well I somebody barrage on I expected

7085.66 --> 7090.16
from zone he's done it from Dart but

7087.94 --> 7093.46
what I don't it what I really don't

7090.16 --> 7096.94
expect is when Nathan does it to me and

7093.46 --> 7098.71
he has in the last two times that I went

7096.94 --> 7099.249
out and he did that like basically

7098.71 --> 7101.53
saying yeah

7099.249 --> 7105.579
we totally pummeled you on the quantum

7101.53 --> 7112.21
mechanics thing he that's yeah like

7105.579 --> 7117.36
seriously messed up Nathan Nathan

7112.21 --> 7120.909
wouldn't do it in a insulting way he did

7117.36 --> 7124.719
it I mean if he had it a laugh to the

7120.909 --> 7125.079
end of it he did he was very smug about

7124.719 --> 7133.63
it

7125.079 --> 7136.989
I wish I'll see you

7133.63 --> 7138.76
I basically said no no that's not what

7136.989 --> 7140.079
happened at all you strawman the [Â __Â ]

7138.76 --> 7142.530000000001
out of me by presenting a false

7140.079 --> 7145.15
dichotomy as I explained at the time and

7142.53 --> 7146.889
he just said again and it's like the

7145.15 --> 7149.348999999999
first third time I caught him saying it

7146.889 --> 7151.539
for time I tried to present my my

7149.349 --> 7153.849
original idea about like not being an

7151.539 --> 7157.15
indivisible particle and all that and he

7153.849 --> 7161.829
would just say I'm a little confused

7157.15 --> 7163.96
here I I'm not sure what you mean so I

7161.829 --> 7166.57
think Nathan just doesn't get it he's

7163.96 --> 7170.71
not trying to get it and he's letting

7166.57 --> 7173.92
John wield his knowledge outside of his

7170.71 --> 7178.929
own understanding that's what I think is

7173.92 --> 7181.71
happening yeah man I mean some people

7178.929 --> 7187.03
out there like it I mean when Nathan

7181.71 --> 7192.699
goes five tickets like almost 270 300

7187.03 --> 7197.889
people watching sometimes obviously some

7192.699 --> 7200.379999999999
people like it some people like fathers

7197.889 --> 7203.05
for breakfast as they would say I guess

7200.38 --> 7204.909000000001
like right - and I'm out like I guess

7203.05 --> 7207.909000000001
they like that well that's the arena

7204.909 --> 7210.039
that's fun to think that a lot of people

7207.909 --> 7212.32
that watch Nathan's come there for the

7210.039 --> 7214.03
arena they get there for the attack they

7212.32 --> 7216.759999999999
get there for the ripping apart and the

7214.03 --> 7221.469
creative attacks and all that and I've

7216.76 --> 7224.9490000000005
been part of that but you know what get

7221.469 --> 7227.139
is kind of all doing the same just oh no

7224.949 --> 7230.65
not a Brenda again oh no not Wiggles

7227.139 --> 7232.34
rump us again and like immediately you

7230.65 --> 7234.29
recognize you could literally

7232.34 --> 7237.05
basically walk right next to them and

7234.29 --> 7239.54
mirror every move every sound they make

7237.05 --> 7241.849
because it's just so the same every time

7239.54 --> 7244.94
let's get old gets old it's like I don't

7241.849 --> 7250.31
want to I don't want to rewatch that

7244.94 --> 7254.78
rerun again the other the other day when

7250.31 --> 7256.4890000000005
you are when you told your chat that you

7254.78 --> 7260.17
are going back to Nathan's I was

7256.489 --> 7265.218999999999
thinking about how Nathan's coming up on

7260.17 --> 7267.889
1,000 shows the number 1,000 and I just

7265.219 --> 7271.88
I thought it was weird how you did it

7267.889 --> 7280.07
like right before that week how could

7271.88 --> 7282.02
you miss the 1,000 I are you are you

7280.07 --> 7286.79
gonna wanna go on that on that day I

7282.02 --> 7289.55
don't think I can look when's the last

7286.79 --> 7291.469
you saw nationhood out to hangout link

7289.55 --> 7294.38
in the master beat yet because he

7291.469 --> 7296.719
doesn't do that anymore I I don't you

7294.38 --> 7298.9400000000005
get links so even if I wanted to get on

7296.719 --> 7303.429
I haven't seen any links I've only seen

7298.94 --> 7306.5
him premiere things so I I don't know

7303.429 --> 7311.36
see I'll see what's good what's gonna

7306.5 --> 7314.36
happen did you and Nathan like get into

7311.36 --> 7318.4
it off air so no I just told you I never

7314.36 --> 7318.4
talked to him okay

7322.14 --> 7330.280000000001
well it's cool man I still enjoy your

7326.29 --> 7333.489
show Thanks and I'm just gonna keep on

7330.28 --> 7336.25
going doing what I do and who knows

7333.489 --> 7338.169999999999
what's gonna come out of it I'm also

7336.25 --> 7340.39
still gonna be popping in to Jose's

7338.17 --> 7341.62
every now and then if it's if it seems

7340.39 --> 7344.9800000000005
like it's gonna be worth it

7341.62 --> 7346.87
and who know look I'm not boycotting

7344.98 --> 7349.78
Nathan it's not like I'm never gonna go

7346.87 --> 7352.75
there again it's just that I'm used to

7349.78 --> 7356.8
go there every day as a routine thing

7352.75 --> 7358.78
and now four out of five times and

7356.8 --> 7360.88
literally literally just bored out of my

7358.78 --> 7364.239
mind over there or as soon as I insert

7360.88 --> 7366.6990000000005
something Nathan go shouting at me so

7364.239 --> 7368.44
it's just I don't know what I'm even

7366.699 --> 7371.739
doing there anymore so I'm just not

7368.44 --> 7377.409
going there to break my own habit for

7371.739 --> 7382.949
starters they say hey to Karen be

7377.409 --> 7386.92
overdoing will thank you for reading out

7382.949 --> 7390.04
nutritious story because that's what

7386.92 --> 7390.61
that's how I listened to it I didn't

7390.04 --> 7394.989
want to read it

7390.61 --> 7398.889999999999
mm-hmm okay no I got it I didn't hear

7394.989 --> 7400.989
about that but look I've not opened my

7398.89 --> 7402.67
eyes to the details of the [Â __Â ] show

7400.989 --> 7405.099999999999
that what was going on for the last

7402.67 --> 7407.77
three or four years between Antonio and

7405.1 --> 7410.83
Patricia because so many disgusting

7407.77 --> 7413.14
things were said and done if verbally

7410.83 --> 7415.9
back and forth I just didn't want to

7413.14 --> 7418.81
hear another word of it and I didn't

7415.9 --> 7421.469
literally didn't listen to a word of

7418.81 --> 7423.9400000000005
anything said concerning Patricia and

7421.469 --> 7426.19
hey if PJ every time he says something

7423.94 --> 7428.469
shitty about that concerning it's just

7426.19 --> 7432.46
gonna be immediately timed out just

7428.469 --> 7434.29
don't want to hear is a word of it cuz

7432.46 --> 7439.21
it's all [Â __Â ] as far as I'm

7434.29 --> 7443.5
concerned well I felt like I've gotten

7439.21 --> 7446.13
closure oh good yeah I'm I'm gonna move

7443.5 --> 7447.96
on I'm not gonna speak about it anymore

7446.13 --> 7450.88
all right

7447.96 --> 7453.659
look if you want if you want it that's

7450.88 --> 7457.409000000001
fine I'm just telling you like

7453.659 --> 7459.989
I get what happens if you're going to be

7457.409 --> 7461.159
talking about that subject all the time

7459.989 --> 7463.32
with a lot of people that are

7461.159 --> 7465.239
conspiratorial about it ill rub off on

7463.32 --> 7468.42
you whether you start out

7465.239 --> 7471.509999999999
disbelieving it in defending Patricia or

7468.42 --> 7474.75
not because of the pure exposure doubts

7471.51 --> 7477.33
will literally like osmosis settle in

7474.75 --> 7478.98
your spirit over a long time if you

7477.33 --> 7481.29
constantly expose yourself that's how it

7478.98 --> 7483.659
happens that's how all these trans festa

7481.29 --> 7485.79
Gatien people for example get all

7483.659 --> 7488.5199999999995
obsessed and suddenly start to see

7485.79 --> 7489.989
[Â __Â ] everywhere that I actually need

7488.52 --> 7491.88
to mention that for a second it seems

7489.989 --> 7493.888999999999
like Owen Benjamin is going on that

7491.88 --> 7496.7390000000005
trainings literally checking out trans

7493.889 --> 7499.59
festa Gatien channels and I'm severely

7496.739 --> 7503.339999999999
worried for him because that's very bad

7499.59 --> 7506.4490000000005
if he gets obsessed over this [Â __Â ] it's

7503.34 --> 7509.13
gonna break his his entire thing

7506.449 --> 7511.83
he's already pointing at people that are

7509.13 --> 7515.1
obviously not [Â __Â ] and saying they

7511.83 --> 7520.07
are and it's like I told him in Chapter

7515.1 --> 7524.55
code that I do it's just don't do it

7520.07 --> 7530.179
people break over that [Â __Â ] so so you

7524.55 --> 7535.08
you obviously this is what you do you

7530.179 --> 7538.1
you tell the public openly that we live

7535.08 --> 7542.73
in a lie right

7538.1 --> 7546.27
no well you live in a world that we the

7542.73 --> 7548.599999999999
world lies about right and we naturally

7546.27 --> 7554.01
believed it because of the nature of

7548.6 --> 7555.900000000001
yeah humans so it's much easier for a

7554.01 --> 7557.9400000000005
human to mate to believe something

7555.9 --> 7560.4
whether that be real or not than to

7557.94 --> 7564.79
disbelieve something whether it be real

7560.4 --> 7568.009999999999
or not unfortunately

7564.79 --> 7568.01
[Music]

7568.69 --> 7575.169999999999
I just I think it's a kind of funny how

7572.47 --> 7577.27
like you you don't want you don't want

7575.17 --> 7579.79
to go to Nathan's anymore but you know

7577.27 --> 7581.14
going on to Jose's you know because it

7579.79 --> 7583.32
used to be the other way around

7581.14 --> 7585.910000000001
I don't know I'm there all the time

7583.32 --> 7587.7699999999995
usually just a bunch of wanking of

7585.91 --> 7590.17
ballers and I don't like that at all

7587.77 --> 7592.63
it's it's get disgusting also but

7590.17 --> 7595.72
sometimes there's something interesting

7592.63 --> 7597.79
going on and I do feel like hey the

7595.72 --> 7600.490000000001
people that are there now the way they

7597.79 --> 7602.11
talk has a place for me and then I'll go

7600.49 --> 7603.79
on there but it's not like I'm joining

7602.11 --> 7605.86
there I don't even listen to it every

7603.79 --> 7608.74
day it's just sometimes just an hour

7605.86 --> 7610.179999999999
non-stop ballers talking over one

7608.74 --> 7615.429999999999
another you can't even make out what's

7610.18 --> 7619.39
talked about so it sometimes it can be

7615.43 --> 7624.13
interesting now to talk to others that

7619.39 --> 7627.13
have a completely different point of

7624.13 --> 7628.900000000001
view nothing you do alright and they

7627.13 --> 7631.42
have a lot of technical knowledge and I

7628.9 --> 7633.37
do like that they had they know a lot of

7631.42 --> 7635.65
devices because they're interested in

7633.37 --> 7637.9
that and that's kind of convenient for

7635.65 --> 7640.719999999999
me because then I can ask them questions

7637.9 --> 7643.99
about these devices that they'll have

7640.72 --> 7645.91
better knowledge about that I do you

7643.99 --> 7648.28
know any presuppositions they have about

7645.91 --> 7649.87
the how that's supposed to work I'll get

7648.28 --> 7652.0
around that because of my very

7649.87 --> 7654.28
understanding of how actually how these

7652.0 --> 7656.68
things work so I have no problem with

7654.28 --> 7659.889999999999
their beliefs getting in the way because

7656.68 --> 7662.41
I can simply filter that out so I get a

7659.89 --> 7664.4800000000005
lot of knowledge from ballers if I get

7662.41 --> 7668.11
the chance and ask them about these

7664.48 --> 7671.049999999999
devices that they know you can tell you

7668.11 --> 7672.7
could tell that they've learned and

7671.05 --> 7675.070000000001
taking the time to come up with an

7672.7 --> 7678.73
answer just some of the questions that

7675.07 --> 7681.849999999999
are flatter there would have it may be

7678.73 --> 7684.339999999999
completely bogus some of them but some

7681.85 --> 7689.26
of them yeah they need a good story they

7684.34 --> 7692.71
need a good confident sounding story for

7689.26 --> 7695.320000000001
the standard questions because with the

7692.71 --> 7697.84
fresh questions there is confidence

7695.32 --> 7700.33
issue with people doubting new globe

7697.84 --> 7701.82
earth so a good confidence story is then

7700.33 --> 7704.62
very

7701.82 --> 7706.389999999999
viable to basically get such a person

7704.62 --> 7709.51
that has doubts back in line because the

7706.39 --> 7711.58
person said it so confidently you must

7709.51 --> 7712.96
have been wrong you know that's the

7711.58 --> 7721.78
trick that's the trick they're trying to

7712.96 --> 7723.219
do it's for the newly exposed yeah I do

7721.78 --> 7729.34
like listening to you when you go on

7723.219 --> 7731.7390000000005
there and I like listening to of course

7729.34 --> 7737.37
like I said it's interesting sometimes

7731.739 --> 7737.37
to hear the point of view of someone who

7737.67 --> 7743.08
it's not even close to wanting to admit

7740.71 --> 7752.19
that they that they've been deceived

7743.08 --> 7755.35
right yeah I find it I don't know it's

7752.19 --> 7757.178999999999
I'm used to it it's always but yeah as

7755.35 --> 7759.070000000001
soon as you really start to push on that

7757.179 --> 7762.25
more and more and you find more angles

7759.07 --> 7764.23
to that that realization that they've

7762.25 --> 7767.199
been fooled that they keep on invading I

7764.23 --> 7769.409
do notice that most of the people really

7767.199 --> 7773.159
get into pure cognitive dissonance

7769.409 --> 7776.86
confusion sewing they like present a

7773.159 --> 7780.129999999999
giant gaping fallacy to your face to

7776.86 --> 7783.46
distract you with to make you point at

7780.13 --> 7784.81
that fallacy instead of addressing the

7783.46 --> 7786.67
real issue that they're trying to

7784.81 --> 7788.9800000000005
protect and that is that they're not

7786.67 --> 7791.89
letting it through to their conscious

7788.98 --> 7793.33
that they've been deceived so it's one

7791.89 --> 7795.01
of the that's typically something that

7793.33 --> 7798.04
Brenda does as soon as she starts to get

7795.01 --> 7800.92
caught and she can't hide from it she

7798.04 --> 7803.83
just starts to make outrageous out of

7800.92 --> 7805.78
nowhere very obviously false claims she

7803.83 --> 7807.57
does this as a distraction move so

7805.78 --> 7810.099999999999
people will start pointing at that

7807.57 --> 7814.0599999999995
instead of the moment right before that

7810.1 --> 7816.01
it's a psychological tactic make a

7814.06 --> 7820.360000000001
mistake on purpose so everybody starts

7816.01 --> 7822.070000000001
pointing at the mistake there was a

7820.36 --> 7827.009999999999
question presented

7822.07 --> 7830.29
the other day on his his show and

7827.01 --> 7832.29
because sometimes it feels like the

7830.29 --> 7835.67
Glovers on that panel

7832.29 --> 7838.05
they don't they'll never concede to

7835.67 --> 7839.63
anything right it's what it seems like

7838.05 --> 7842.88
there they seem like they're really

7839.63 --> 7845.37
rooted in this globe like they're not

7842.88 --> 7850.1
letting go and there was a question that

7845.37 --> 7856.92
was presented yeah and the question was

7850.1 --> 7863.400000000001
where is one source for a globe model a

7856.92 --> 7868.2300000000005
globe basically a model that covers

7863.4 --> 7871.82
everything right and so they couldn't

7868.23 --> 7875.759999999999
obviously concede but some of them would

7871.82 --> 7877.5599999999995
admit that there are holes and you have

7875.76 --> 7882.08
to the globe model comes from different

7877.56 --> 7885.81
sources and again brenda was trying to

7882.08 --> 7888.39
put her a universal spin on it

7885.81 --> 7892.9800000000005
right all right the philosophical tie-in

7888.39 --> 7896.700000000001
of it all all all models lead into one

7892.98 --> 7899.489
to make the globe right because water

7896.7 --> 7903.44
flat earthers asked a lot where's your

7899.489 --> 7907.5599999999995
model where's your model mm-hmm well a

7903.44 --> 7911.7
Kluber doesn't even have one place one

7907.56 --> 7914.67
source that they can go to to get every

7911.7 --> 7916.08
detail all the data you have to get it

7914.67 --> 7921.96
from many different sources

7916.08 --> 7926.28
would you agree the body of science is a

7921.96 --> 7929.55
giant amalgamation of just a lot of

7926.28 --> 7931.5
separate pieces with kind of a same

7929.55 --> 7933.3
directive and then what they're

7931.5 --> 7935.67
literally trying to do with the whole

7933.3 --> 7939.12
globe religion is basically try to solve

7935.67 --> 7941.4890000000005
an unsolvable puzzle by putting a lot of

7939.12 --> 7945.63
pieces together in a giant puzzle

7941.489 --> 7947.91
framework and the people keep on trying

7945.63 --> 7951.06
to put those puzzle pieces in but the

7947.91 --> 7953.01
people that made the puzzle know that it

7951.06 --> 7954.75
that there are missing pieces and that

7953.01 --> 7956.64
it can never be solved but they don't

7954.75 --> 7961.79
tell the people that actually are doing

7956.64 --> 7964.849
the puzzle that's the body of science

7961.79 --> 7967.32
wow that was good

7964.849 --> 7969.079
that was good came out on the spot but

7967.32 --> 7973.228999999999
it's a it's a pretty good comparison

7969.079 --> 7975.599
yeah that was good because it is like a

7973.229 --> 7977.76
puzzle it really feels like a puzzle it

7975.599 --> 7979.469
felt to me like a puzzle still the idea

7977.76 --> 7981.419
we making Space Station it's like a

7979.469 --> 7983.28
giant puzzle are you gonna put it how

7981.419 --> 7987.51
are you gonna make it theoretically

7983.28 --> 7989.938999999999
impossible know that it's a puzzle let's

7987.51 --> 7996.079000000001
keep on building building in your mind

7989.939 --> 8003.650000000001
building on paper building it in a movie

7996.079 --> 8006.049999999999
and the hope is one day gonna happen but

8003.65 --> 8007.759999999999
you'll yeah most people either don't

8006.05 --> 8016.429
find out or find out when they're very

8007.76 --> 8019.669
old you know I agree that but in a way

8016.429 --> 8024.829
like someone that's asking for a model

8019.669 --> 8027.229
right is that basically them asking they

8024.829 --> 8030.38
need to know what the earth is right in

8027.229 --> 8033.9490000000005
a way I mean they need to know what to

8030.38 --> 8036.619
visualize in their mind that's what

8033.949 --> 8039.978999999999
they're basically asking how do I

8036.619 --> 8042.199
visualize it because I learned to when I

8039.979 --> 8043.88
think about the earth to visualize it

8042.199 --> 8046.249
that's where it started so they see that

8043.88 --> 8048.59
at all so they're asking so what do I

8046.249 --> 8050.209
replace this ball with in my mind what

8048.59 --> 8052.82
is your model please give me that

8050.209 --> 8055.61
replacement of that that ball that I've

8052.82 --> 8057.558999999999
been conditioned to visualize every time

8055.61 --> 8060.289
I think of the earth please help me

8057.559 --> 8064.189
replace it why why do you think it's

8060.289 --> 8067.809
difficult for some to possibly accept

8064.189 --> 8071.63
that some things just cannot be defined

8067.809 --> 8073.909000000001
because they have defined it and they

8071.63 --> 8076.88
can't accept that that's that the ending

8073.909 --> 8079.999
layer yeah but if nobody believed they

8076.88 --> 8084.169
have and when you get used to that it's

8079.999 --> 8089.15
really almost impossible to stop doing

8084.169 --> 8091.13
it because you have a void it's like you

8089.15 --> 8095.209
roughly could compare it to a heroin

8091.13 --> 8097.249
addiction if you need you get it it's

8095.209 --> 8098.119
like takes on everything becomes

8097.249 --> 8100.07
everything

8098.119 --> 8102.29
in a way it starts to change your entire

8100.07 --> 8105.5
mindset what you look out for and all

8102.29 --> 8107.36
that now if you stop yeah what are you

8105.5 --> 8109.61
gonna do to it that's the difficult part

8107.36 --> 8113.8099999999995
because what are you gonna replace it

8109.61 --> 8115.429
with you know that's how they fall back

8113.81 --> 8121.96
because it keeps staring them in the

8115.429 --> 8124.9400000000005
face is it lucky is it a ego thing

8121.96 --> 8125.51
it's it's just strange you know it's an

8124.94 --> 8128.419999999999
addiction

8125.51 --> 8133.31
based on the imagination and the

8128.42 --> 8136.58
euphoria that comes with it it's

8133.31 --> 8138.4400000000005
basically a little kid oh the dream

8136.58 --> 8140.3
world look at all these amazing things

8138.44 --> 8142.549999999999
that I'm imagining and I'm kind of

8140.3 --> 8146.3
seeing it and the ecstasy that comes

8142.55 --> 8153.04
with that that's the mechanism they've

8146.3 --> 8157.34
built it around the ecstasy seeing Islam

8153.04 --> 8161.719
was it was it tough for you to take a

8157.34 --> 8164.119000000001
blank page and learn what you but you

8161.719 --> 8166.52
know now like was that tough for you to

8164.119 --> 8170.0599999999995
like start over it was impossible I

8166.52 --> 8173.96
didn't listen I literally took two books

8170.06 --> 8178.4890000000005
I wrote it but I didn't believe it I

8173.96 --> 8181.07
just it couldn't I couldn't switch yet I

8178.489 --> 8187.159
could presuppose it but I couldn't

8181.07 --> 8189.17
switch and then every time I bumped back

8187.159 --> 8191.839999999999
into that book and sometimes I did

8189.17 --> 8195.889
cognitive dissonance switch but it was

8191.84 --> 8197.689
always unexpected it's like yeah I heard

8195.889 --> 8199.639
about that and then so these like what

8197.689 --> 8202.309000000001
the hell it's all turned around and then

8199.639 --> 8204.559
suddenly I switch it is very

8202.309 --> 8206.599
uncomfortable and like feels like you're

8204.559 --> 8208.518999999998
going insane because everything feels it

8206.599 --> 8213.74
looks different people sound different

8208.519 --> 8215.599
it's like suddenly being dispelled or

8213.74 --> 8218.08
third putting on the ring like

8215.599 --> 8220.849
everything suddenly changes and that's

8218.08 --> 8224.03
that was very disconcerting I remember

8220.849 --> 8227.12
that happening think in 2011 how it once

8224.03 --> 8229.719000000001
happened accidentally I just bumped into

8227.12 --> 8229.719000000001
a video

8229.96 --> 8235.91
but that could potentially be in the

8233.06 --> 8243.381
dark world because I it was Eric Dubay

8235.91 --> 8249.32
video so that couldn't be in 2011 this

8243.381 --> 8252.801
is on Eric Dubay his is to his video 200

8249.32 --> 8254.48
was it 200 proves the earth is a desert

8252.801 --> 8256.85
this flyer it was that the entire 11 the

8254.48 --> 8259.25
earth is not a globe Bryan Aires is not

8256.85 --> 8263.06
a quote if you think about it

8259.25 --> 8272.33
I had a 200 all he had to do was get one

8263.06 --> 8274.789999999999
right boy right but yeah I mean I don't

8272.33 --> 8278.75
know it's it's just it's strange to me

8274.79 --> 8282.591
why back to the model thing why does

8278.75 --> 8286.99
someone need something laid out for what

8282.591 --> 8289.33
the earth is because they're used to it

8286.99 --> 8292.94
that's because I'm really sorry because

8289.33 --> 8298.16
I'm starting to consider that what's

8292.94 --> 8300.83
above us and know the likes above us it

8298.16 --> 8306.32
cannot be defined they are what they are

8300.83 --> 8309.14
the Sun does what it does the moon is in

8306.32 --> 8312.82
desperate I disagree respectfully though

8309.14 --> 8315.68
but I think that it's probably almost

8312.82 --> 8318.26
impossible or very hard to define it

8315.68 --> 8321.171
with the understandings and the basic

8318.26 --> 8324.381
knowledge that we've grown up with in

8321.171 --> 8327.56
this world so it'll probably require

8324.381 --> 8329.840999999999
some really creative out there approach

8327.56 --> 8332.72
and a bit of luck of hitting the right

8329.841 --> 8336.86
snare in this in the mental exploration

8332.72 --> 8339.051
and then I think it could be figured out

8336.86 --> 8344.480000000001
and potentially even miniature

8339.051 --> 8346.551
back-engineered but so that's it's so

8344.48 --> 8349.16
easy but it's very hard to figure it out

8346.551 --> 8352.671
with the typical knowledge that we get

8349.16 --> 8355.9
raised with right it's kept out of it

8352.671 --> 8359.95
the tools need ever find it

8355.9 --> 8362.0
you would never would would you ever

8359.95 --> 8366.470000000001
teach a child

8362.0 --> 8370.21
something 100% fact about something in

8366.47 --> 8373.76
the about the Sun all right

8370.21 --> 8378.949999999999
you can always speculate but no never be

8373.76 --> 8383.48
able to define that to a child yes I

8378.95 --> 8383.93
could on several different levels yes I

8383.48 --> 8386.0
can

8383.93 --> 8388.31
it all depends on the age of the kid

8386.0 --> 8390.2
though what as soon as they start to

8388.31 --> 8392.15
understand that there may be different

8390.2 --> 8393.650000000001
explanations for the same thing as soon

8392.15 --> 8396.109999999999
as they are capable of understanding

8393.65 --> 8399.49
that that's when I'm that when I will

8396.11 --> 8402.11
introduce and teach them two-wheeled

8399.49 --> 8405.171
multi-level narratives to distinguish

8402.11 --> 8408.141000000001
between different conceptual conflicting

8405.171 --> 8410.15
things and keep track of both I'll teach

8408.141 --> 8413.391
him that because that is absolutely

8410.15 --> 8414.921
critical for the coming generations they

8413.391 --> 8417.891
don't learn that they die

8414.921 --> 8420.5
no no disrespect to yours but I feel

8417.891 --> 8423.801
like you're pulling a Brenda with the

8420.5 --> 8425.511
whole universal I combine everything

8423.801 --> 8433.100999999999
into my terms

8425.511 --> 8436.45
what do you mean well so as a child goes

8433.101 --> 8444.141000000001
to school and a child gets taught that

8436.45 --> 8447.41
the son is physical it's has a core or

8444.141 --> 8450.74
whatever it gets done well that depends

8447.41 --> 8453.44
alright are they gonna ask me before

8450.74 --> 8457.07
they go to school or am I even gonna let

8453.44 --> 8461.210000000001
them go to school do homeschooling so no

8457.07 --> 8464.539999999999
I will teach them this is what the

8461.21 --> 8468.289999999999
official story tells it is this is what

8464.54 --> 8470.631000000001
I've learned from my discovery then see

8468.29 --> 8472.94
if they can get it or if they literally

8470.631 --> 8477.020999999999
start crying from stress because it's

8472.94 --> 8479.75
too complicated it all depends I hope it

8477.021 --> 8482.931
won't get that far but it's it's a

8479.75 --> 8486.41
process and as soon as they can handle

8482.931 --> 8488.811
it then I'll literally start telling

8486.41 --> 8490.341
them about yeah we're all figuring it

8488.811 --> 8494.631
out and there's just a lot of people

8490.341 --> 8495.59
that builds trains of thought assuming

8494.631 --> 8497.449999999999
that is real

8495.59 --> 8499.7
and that is how it is put out there and

8497.45 --> 8501.740000000002
it's very complex you just have to keep

8499.7 --> 8505.04
track of as many things as possible and

8501.74 --> 8507.08
then hope on the way you'll figure out

8505.04 --> 8514.479000000001
what is right and what is wrong about

8507.08 --> 8517.58
everything it's that difficult well I

8514.479 --> 8521.779999999999
you know obviously with that's something

8517.58 --> 8524.149
that we don't agree on I I totally think

8521.78 --> 8527.149000000001
that what's above us and the lights

8524.149 --> 8530.689
above us cannot be defined and they're

8527.149 --> 8534.649
not meant to be defined okay well

8530.689 --> 8542.18
there's no there's no man on earth that

8534.649 --> 8546.108999999999
knows what the Sun is isn't that man is

8542.18 --> 8549.26
not exist but what if you back engineer

8546.109 --> 8551.45
the thing the actual phenomena of the

8549.26 --> 8556.79
heavenly bodies including the Sun and on

8551.45 --> 8559.729000000001
a on a world on a a so a piece a spot

8556.79 --> 8562.640000000001
what if you can literally back engineer

8559.729 --> 8567.229
the entire thing make it exactly like

8562.64 --> 8569.21
that in miniature somehow wouldn't that

8567.229 --> 8570.619999999999
explain it wouldn't you be able to

8569.21 --> 8573.05
basically say look they're this

8570.62 --> 8575.149000000001
mechanism is called is what literally

8573.05 --> 8578.149
causes that holographic effect of the

8575.149 --> 8582.858999999999
entire heavenly bodies like that exactly

8578.149 --> 8587.81
like it it's just very complex and not

8582.859 --> 8590.41
straightforward so they're the spur

8587.81 --> 8595.31
schema when he was presenting his idea

8590.41 --> 8598.43
he always stated that anytime pressure

8595.31 --> 8602.26
is being demonstrated it's always in a

8598.43 --> 8605.27
container a man-made container there's

8602.26 --> 8612.649
he was asking for demonstrations of

8605.27 --> 8615.380000000001
pressure in the earth I guess not in not

8612.649 --> 8619.67
literally in the earth but not in a

8615.38 --> 8621.259999999998
container by using the earth I guess

8619.67 --> 8624.34
that's that's broad I'm not really

8621.26 --> 8624.34
saying it right but

8624.58 --> 8629.95
it's kind of like planning of a gas

8626.68 --> 8635.62
right here naturally it's like gas in

8629.95 --> 8637.960000000001
the earth gas in creatures just there's

8635.62 --> 8640.060000000001
so many examples of gas pressure that

8637.96 --> 8645.369999999999
naturally arrived just that I guess what

8640.06 --> 8648.76
I'm trying to say is a man puts gasses

8645.37 --> 8650.859
in a container and observes what happens

8648.76 --> 8654.37
to him and what they form and what they

8650.859 --> 8659.140000000001
do and then in that container that

8654.37 --> 8664.75
person makes an arbitrarily fact to what

8659.14 --> 8667.96
is happening on the earth by what

8664.75 --> 8670.569
happened in that container and I think

8667.96 --> 8674.259999999998
that's what spurs was trying to point

8670.569 --> 8676.539999999999
across that what they're stating as a

8674.26 --> 8679.81
fact is what that man created in the

8676.54 --> 8680.35
container not on earth doesn't make any

8679.81 --> 8685.569
sense

8680.35 --> 8687.640000000001
because if you have a a gas tank you

8685.569 --> 8689.5
have a pressure sensor in it's sensing

8687.64 --> 8692.319
oh there's this level of pressure do you

8689.5 --> 8695.08
have a pressure sensor outside this

8692.319 --> 8698.83
pressure you open up the container it

8695.08 --> 8703.3
goes out you'll notice how look it's now

8698.83 --> 8705.22
here it's now in that same pressure here

8703.3 --> 8707.649
and it's not changed really that much

8705.22 --> 8710.89
it's pretty big container having all

8707.649 --> 8716.92
that pressure did nothing he says makes

8710.89 --> 8719.05
any damn sense about it it's just so I

8716.92 --> 8720.76
understand I'm just I'm just there's

8719.05 --> 8722.83
pressure everywhere and his whole

8720.76 --> 8725.380000000001
temperature idea is nonsensical

8722.83 --> 8728.8
temperature change only comes into being

8725.38 --> 8730.66
where the pressure differential happens

8728.8 --> 8732.729
where the actual pressure change

8730.66 --> 8735.31
manifests that's where the temperature

8732.729 --> 8739.779999999999
comes in not the entire container all of

8735.31 --> 8743.819
that is just there's no logic behind it

8739.78 --> 8743.819000000001
for him what he says at all

8745.031 --> 8752.001
okay I understand I wish she would like

8750.011 --> 8755.871000000001
conversation about it more though I wish

8752.001 --> 8762.801
she wouldn't be so like against it that

8755.871 --> 8765.680999999999
I wouldn't against what the reasons the

8762.801 --> 8768.260999999999
reasons but he makes a claim he makes a

8765.681 --> 8771.561
claim and then I can literally point why

8768.261 --> 8776.571
that is wrong with really like life

8771.561 --> 8779.001
examples he claims there is no pressure

8776.571 --> 8780.891
is the temperature change if that were

8779.001 --> 8782.211
the case then if you change the

8780.891 --> 8785.600999999999
temperature the pressure should

8782.211 --> 8791.951
immediately correlate alike and the

8785.601 --> 8794.661
other way around it doesn't very simple

8791.951 --> 8797.840999999999
because if there's pressure change then

8794.661 --> 8801.141
temperature is changed only at the

8797.841 --> 8802.871000000001
exchange point not universally in the

8801.141 --> 8805.520999999999
entire thing while the pressure

8802.871 --> 8809.901
universally does in the entire container

8805.521 --> 8814.221000000001
change so it's just not true it's very

8809.901 --> 8815.811
specific how it happens that that

8814.221 --> 8818.23
temperature change due to pressure

8815.811 --> 8818.23
change

8819.101 --> 8827.661
it's it like when Spurs makes that claim

8822.771 --> 8831.281
it sounds outlandish at first it does it

8827.661 --> 8831.281
said it does sound crazy because it's

8831.551 --> 8836.001
pressure you know that's not like like

8834.081 --> 8840.801
we're taught there there's a constant

8836.001 --> 8844.181
114 or something like where we are right

8840.801 --> 8848.061
obviously it's lower as you rise but

8844.181 --> 8851.601
it's it's just and asked it's just this

8848.061 --> 8854.181
much that's it they call it 14 it's this

8851.601 --> 8860.721000000001
much that's how much it is that's the

8854.181 --> 8868.221000000001
anchor the number is just no it's just a

8860.721 --> 8873.371
measuring stick cause the pressure oh I

8868.221 --> 8875.841
first figured it out I hope he does

8873.371 --> 8878.48
because if what you're saying is the

8875.841 --> 8881.001
truth then that's if he's looking for

8878.48 --> 8884.061
the truth and that's what he should come

8881.001 --> 8886.251
to well in discussions he doesn't

8884.061 --> 8889.181
actually investigate remarks from other

8886.251 --> 8892.461
people because I have told this to him

8889.181 --> 8895.161
like did you say pressure doesn't exist

8892.461 --> 8897.651
it's all temperature the pressure is

8895.161 --> 8901.521
presupposed well then there should be a

8897.651 --> 8904.071
universal layover with the temperature

8901.521 --> 8907.94
and the pressure and the pressure

8904.071 --> 8911.511
exchange disproves that because that is

8907.94 --> 8914.631000000001
where the cold and the heat exchange

8911.511 --> 8917.241
actually is and not in the entire thing

8914.631 --> 8920.991
while the entire pressure is universally

8917.241 --> 8932.661
changed it's there is no this it's a

8920.991 --> 8935.421
mismatch that's it I guess sorry I need

8932.661 --> 8937.221
to have a break by the way we go in the

8935.421 --> 8941.121000000001
word merit to a two and a half hours

8937.221 --> 8946.901
almost yeah but it was great thanks for

8941.121 --> 8950.500999999998
being on my show for so long yeah yep

8946.901 --> 8950.501
I'm gonna take a break

8954.21 --> 8960.0
well I mean like yeah thank you for at

8956.699 --> 8965.01
least talking to me about of course at

8960.0 --> 8968.04
least the the Patricia thing it just

8965.01 --> 8971.16
kind of weirded me out you know I just I

8968.04 --> 8975.210000000001
don't I don't see how a person could be

8971.16 --> 8980.76
called spoken and want to let people

8975.21 --> 8983.759999999998
know about a deception and then not want

8980.76 --> 8986.880000000001
to do it maybe she still does she just

8983.76 --> 8988.35
doesn't want to be so involved okay if

8986.88 --> 8992.63
you're gonna talk about that I'm gonna

8988.35 --> 8992.630000000001
have a break me right man yeah okay

9105.44 --> 9115.82
hello sorry audience I just couldn't

9113.25 --> 9115.82
hold it any longer

9116.99 --> 9122.119999999999
still there yeah you good okay

9126.11 --> 9138.721000000001
yeah that was like an entire pot of tea

9129.9 --> 9139.561
and a cup of coffee so care to ask a

9138.721 --> 9143.73
good question

9139.561 --> 9147.421
no see it's just you know because first

9143.73 --> 9151.350999999999
says it's the temperature that changes

9147.421 --> 9155.16
things Karen s what causes the

9151.351 --> 9158.58
temperature all right

9155.16 --> 9161.551
yeah the pressure to exchange and so

9158.58 --> 9165.78
like that that is kind of what I've been

9161.551 --> 9170.25
thinking because we get our weather from

9165.78 --> 9174.710000000001
pressure changing right like wind right

9170.25 --> 9177.15
is from pressure changing right right

9174.71 --> 9180.391
that's kind of that's kind of the way

9177.15 --> 9183.301
cold weather fronts they sink down all

9180.391 --> 9185.49
of a sudden into the heat and that's our

9183.301 --> 9191.341
storms and everything comes so it is

9185.49 --> 9194.82
yeah the displacement of of heat that

9191.341 --> 9197.881000000001
really causes we had the the air layers

9194.82 --> 9199.921
this low-pressure zone I yeah it is it

9197.881 --> 9205.010999999999
is a mix and whether it is kind of a mix

9199.921 --> 9209.57
because like the pressure lowers and

9205.011 --> 9213.351
that means that then also the upper

9209.57 --> 9217.591
colder air is gonna sink down and then

9213.351 --> 9220.021
that that front between the warmer lower

9217.591 --> 9222.301
down air and the colder air coming from

9220.021 --> 9225.78
up which is also happens to be different

9222.301 --> 9228.689999999999
pressures it really causes a lot of the

9225.78 --> 9234.271
storm basically storm clouds and all

9228.69 --> 9236.721000000001
that and the heavy weather movement if

9234.271 --> 9236.721000000001
I'm correct

9237.811 --> 9243.971
but I look in a way I do see the

9241.87 --> 9247.631000000001
connection why he would think that

9243.971 --> 9250.9
because especially in the open the the

9247.631 --> 9254.23
relation seems very close but when you

9250.9 --> 9255.91
test how temperature like Karen B I said

9254.23 --> 9258.07
like what is the cause of the

9255.91 --> 9260.171
temperature change well it is the

9258.07 --> 9263.86
pressure exchange that's really where it

9260.171 --> 9265.57
comes in that's the point where the

9263.86 --> 9266.650000000001
temperature suddenly starts to change

9265.57 --> 9268.631
dramatically

9266.65 --> 9273.131
it's where the pressure and locally is

9268.631 --> 9276.99
exchanged Spurs are also states that the

9273.131 --> 9286.0
Sun plays a significant role in that

9276.99 --> 9289.421
change about that we think about that

9286.0 --> 9293.23
that's logical look the Sun heats up the

9289.421 --> 9297.131
earth the earth then gives its heat off

9293.23 --> 9299.32
to the air that's how warmth basically

9297.131 --> 9301.600999999999
comes into being the warm air comes into

9299.32 --> 9303.431
being from the Sun heating up the earth

9301.601 --> 9306.671
and that earth giving off its heat to

9303.431 --> 9309.851
the air so yeah that's of course the Sun

9306.671 --> 9315.16
has a critical role in this see you do

9309.851 --> 9317.86
agree with and what that the Sun has a

9315.16 --> 9321.851
giant influence influence and basically

9317.86 --> 9327.37
causes meteorology yeah yeah of course

9321.851 --> 9331.66
later later absolutely you're not you

9327.37 --> 9334.210000000001
know that all the way you're just

9331.66 --> 9335.619999999999
partially yes no I just think it's

9334.21 --> 9339.58
technically incorrect

9335.62 --> 9342.460000000001
I think he's pursuing an aberration say

9339.58 --> 9345.851
something that seems a correlation that

9342.46 --> 9347.801
could follow a lot but if you really get

9345.851 --> 9349.141000000001
into the details it's not technically

9347.801 --> 9353.859999999999
correct

9349.141 --> 9357.19
that's that's what so that is do you

9353.86 --> 9362.32
think you think the claim that Spurs

9357.19 --> 9367.480000000001
made or Bob no doubt his claim for

9362.32 --> 9371.25
gravity which one is more is the most

9367.48 --> 9371.25
outrÃ© Bob steer

9372.431 --> 9377.230000000001
of course he's literally claiming

9374.921 --> 9380.141
science when it is absolutely obvious

9377.23 --> 9382.119999999999
there is not he's trying to bypass the

9380.141 --> 9385.301
rules of science in order to get his way

9382.12 --> 9387.160000000002
that is much more outlandish than making

9385.301 --> 9391.051
a horrific mistake in your

9387.16 --> 9391.051
interpretation of how something works

9391.171 --> 9398.11
it's very stupid to keep on pushing it

9394.15 --> 9398.619999999999
while being told what yeah that's what I

9398.11 --> 9402.221000000001
said

9398.62 --> 9406.45
he basically is worse because he is

9402.221 --> 9410.381
trying to make something into something

9406.45 --> 9413.08
it's not like trying to bypass the rules

9410.381 --> 9418.930999999999
as he goes that he's trying to pull a

9413.08 --> 9422.289999999999
burner yeah in a way no but I think

9418.931 --> 9424.751
that's definitely working me give me

9422.29 --> 9426.490000000002
Karen because I know I know Karen and

9424.751 --> 9428.681
Bob well I really did for it all right

9426.49 --> 9430.561
she probably doesn't like she boy

9428.681 --> 9433.511
doesn't like us

9430.561 --> 9435.971
well that's gonna be difficult because I

9433.511 --> 9437.95
do talk about it and I do address it and

9435.971 --> 9439.930999999999
I don't think it's I don't think that

9437.95 --> 9442.091
Bob is really nefarious I just think

9439.931 --> 9444.011
he's just really freaking stubborn and

9442.091 --> 9446.32
when it comes to this gravity concept

9444.011 --> 9448.301000000001
and I know because I was there I was

9446.32 --> 9450.761
there I was the one actually defending

9448.301 --> 9453.73
it on the fire of debates front line and

9450.761 --> 9456.04
then I figured out what's going on and

9453.73 --> 9458.891
I'm kind of disappointed that Bob

9456.04 --> 9462.820000000002
doesn't agree doesn't draw the same

9458.891 --> 9465.341
conclusion doesn't go there doesn't back

9462.82 --> 9467.23
practically feed back to me that he even

9465.341 --> 9471.94
gets what I'm talking about when I talk

9467.23 --> 9475.9
about the aberration and just tries to

9471.94 --> 9477.94
say no it's it's there anyway we just

9475.9 --> 9481.66
have to think about it slightly

9477.94 --> 9485.08
differently on what scientific proof is

9481.66 --> 9486.94
and so yeah he bypasses that and it does

9485.08 --> 9489.851
the same thing as what the ballers do

9486.94 --> 9492.721000000001
and yeah like you said like Brenda and

9489.851 --> 9497.021
that is what also was the original issue

9492.721 --> 9499.66
from Nathan side to Bob because he kept

9497.021 --> 9502.931
on doing that he was trying to change

9499.66 --> 9504.7
the scientific method to get his way

9502.931 --> 9510.730000000001
that was the main issue that Nathan had

9504.7 --> 9514.990000000002
with Bob it's it's very obvious that

9510.73 --> 9520.48
once both parties can't agree and

9514.99 --> 9525.011
respect these scientific method then the

9520.48 --> 9527.83
conversation cannot progress you see

9525.011 --> 9531.91
what happened between bar Nathan they

9527.83 --> 9534.07
don't agree on that method right now I'm

9531.91 --> 9537.69
the foundation if they if they both

9534.07 --> 9541.681
agreed and respect you it could progress

9537.69 --> 9544.391
one of them has to has to well now given

9541.681 --> 9546.730000000001
that scientific method doesn't need to

9544.391 --> 9549.011
progress it works as it does

9546.73 --> 9551.369999999999
there's complex hypotheses though but

9549.011 --> 9554.2
those are already those already exist so

9551.37 --> 9556.181
that's it the system is already there we

9554.2 --> 9558.971000000001
got everything we really need the

9556.181 --> 9562.03
problem is is that people have been

9558.971 --> 9565.75
culturally indoctrinated over the ages

9562.03 --> 9568.931
over the years the decades to be wanting

9565.75 --> 9571.511
to make things in their mind be accepted

9568.931 --> 9574.391
as a real thing that's the real big

9571.511 --> 9576.82
problem that's the the core foundation

9574.391 --> 9581.19
of scientism they want the thing that

9576.82 --> 9581.19
they imagine to be accepted as real

9584.341 --> 9593.141
progressing as moving the conversation

9587.681 --> 9596.95
on rather than trying to get people to

9593.141 --> 9600.58
debate about a force right moving it to

9596.95 --> 9605.141000000001
progress to something that maybe will

9600.58 --> 9610.87
benefit some of us in a way I just don't

9605.141 --> 9614.471
I tried I tried to re-engineer the

9610.87 --> 9616.69
relative density remember explaining

9614.471 --> 9619.091
what causes the forces what's really

9616.69 --> 9621.851
going on force wise based on the

9619.091 --> 9624.431
relative density concept and it works

9621.851 --> 9627.67
out great so I can literally replace

9624.431 --> 9630.4
replace every aspect of the gravity

9627.67 --> 9634.15
aberrations of the phenomena that are

9630.4 --> 9636.74
thought of to be part of the what is

9634.15 --> 9640.869999999999
gravity can replace every

9636.74 --> 9644.18
single aspect of it every phenomena and

9640.87 --> 9646.04
replace it with a well a uniform

9644.18 --> 9649.36
structure based on the relative

9646.04 --> 9653.93
densities on the relative density

9649.36 --> 9655.79
concept so it works it's just that it

9653.93 --> 9658.82
hasn't really caught on yet and I get

9655.79 --> 9660.77
the feeling right I don't know why

9658.82 --> 9665.33
because I've been already doing that for

9660.77 --> 9667.07
almost half a year now but if you like

9665.33 --> 9672.89
people should be getting it and they're

9667.07 --> 9673.94
known yeah yeah I have that a lot and I

9672.89 --> 9677.21
mean a lot

9673.94 --> 9679.310000000001
bringing new things people say and then

9677.21 --> 9681.83
they kind of ignore it and keep on doing

9679.31 --> 9684.109999999999
what they have been doing and then maybe

9681.83 --> 9686.36
if I'm lucky after a year or something

9684.11 --> 9688.640000000001
everybody will suddenly figure it all

9686.36 --> 9690.050000000001
out what I said a year ago I'd like it's

9688.64 --> 9695.42
the newest thing they did just

9690.05 --> 9698.17
discovered but I don't know everybody's

9695.42 --> 9700.729
doing this at at their own pace and

9698.17 --> 9702.5
sometimes people don't want others to

9700.729 --> 9705.109999999999
discover things because they want to

9702.5 --> 9713.72
discover it for themselves when they are

9705.11 --> 9717.140000000001
ready for it so I got myself included I

9713.72 --> 9719.3
I literally in the past was confronted

9717.14 --> 9721.189999999999
like ooh super heavy information or

9719.3 --> 9722.929999999998
somebody's making really awesome

9721.19 --> 9726.140000000001
progress and I just didn't want to know

9722.93 --> 9729.32
about it because I wasn't really up to

9726.14 --> 9732.38
it yet so I avoided because I didn't

9729.32 --> 9734.15
want to be shamed by myself with the

9732.38 --> 9740.72
realization that I just wasn't smart

9734.15 --> 9742.789999999999
enough to get any of it yet still many

9740.72 --> 9744.5
different levels right well that was

9742.79 --> 9747.229000000001
quantum mechanics back then I just

9744.5 --> 9749.33
didn't engage because I just didn't hurt

9747.229 --> 9751.429999999998
too much it was too complex for me at

9749.33 --> 9754.76
the time I didn't understand what I

9751.43 --> 9757.79
needed to be paying attention to so I

9754.76 --> 9761.9
just avoided it but now years later

9757.79 --> 9763.970000000001
years decades later I feel yeah all

9761.9 --> 9764.539999999999
those things are not so threatening to

9763.97 --> 9769.22
me anymore

9764.54 --> 9771.820000000002
I really got a feel for it now so now

9769.22 --> 9771.82
I'm gonna do it

9773.47 --> 9779.21
I'm gonna round up show man yeah yeah

9777.08 --> 9781.58
yeah I was just about to say man I'm

9779.21 --> 9784.16
gonna better let you go thank you yeah

9781.58 --> 9786.59
thank you for letting me speak thank you

9784.16 --> 9790.52
yeah thanks for being there was a great

9786.59 --> 9792.7
long conversation and yeah interesting

9790.52 --> 9795.52
subjects good stuff

9792.7 --> 9801.28
so great having you thanks for coming

9795.52 --> 9804.74
yeah it's just that last question do you

9801.28 --> 9811.550000000001
you think you think Jose knows it's flat

9804.74 --> 9813.32
I think he stopped caring he doesn't he
