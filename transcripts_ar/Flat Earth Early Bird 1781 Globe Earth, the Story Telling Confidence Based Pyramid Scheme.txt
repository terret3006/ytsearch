265.4 --> 269.67999999999995
know if I didn't know that was going to

266.8 --> 273.0
happen but the fourth hour of Infowars

269.68 --> 275.199
was Owen Benjamin basically presenting

273.0 --> 275.199
that

278.199 --> 283.68
hour and he did an amazing job like

282.08 --> 286.96
really

283.68 --> 290.0
amazing he just got to do his thing and

286.96 --> 294.19899999999996
he was like really on edge on the edge I

290.0 --> 298.8
mean not on edge on the

294.199 --> 301.16
edge with like the how to regard Jews

298.8 --> 305.24
thing consider considering the global

301.16 --> 310.28000000000003
political circumstances and everything

305.24 --> 310.28000000000003

you terit 306 good to see you hellow

378.36 --> 383.68
fruit glad you could all make it I'm

381.639 --> 387.40000000000003
glad that I could make it sorry I'm so

383.68 --> 390.12
freaking late it's terrible I really

387.4 --> 392.84
thought that with like the

390.12 --> 397.039
the winter time

392.84 --> 400.84
shift I would adapt but it seems like

397.039 --> 400.84
I've I just moved

401.12 --> 412.24
it yeah no wrench that's right no wrench

406.479 --> 412.24
cuz that's not the real D

418.4 --> 421.4
306

429.759 --> 433.879
I just realized

431.36 --> 436.52000000000004
it I just named him in the list but it's

433.879 --> 436.52000000000004
not actually

436.84 --> 441.35999999999996
him it's the fake sock

443.879 --> 449.44
account yeah and it's probably the same

446.039 --> 452.24
one I think it's Johnny it's a it's a

449.44 --> 454.8
some Johnny probably now trying to

452.24 --> 457.52
pretend to be

454.8 --> 461.52000000000004
teret cuz I don't think it's like

457.52 --> 461.52
multiple accounts it's just unbanning

472.8 --> 475.8
itself

478.159 --> 485.479
yeah yeah there's no more moderation

480.8 --> 490.72
nonsense going on by the way

485.479 --> 490.71999999999997
so we got the INF Trend this time for

490.759 --> 495.639
real right

493.319 --> 499.28000000000003
anyway they'll try to keep [ __ ]

495.639 --> 499.28000000000003
around as they always

505.84 --> 511.87899999999996
do

507.36 --> 514.44
right anyway uh where was I yeah didn't

511.879 --> 518.039
anybody catch like Owen

514.44 --> 521.479
Benjamin yesterday on Infowars probably

518.039 --> 524.3199999999999
I don't know maybe lumpy gas in the

521.479 --> 527.0
vacuum I think the rest of you are all

524.32 --> 527.0
really into

527.399 --> 531.16
it into Alex

533.399 --> 538.959
Jones if you want to check it out I have

536.279 --> 541.2
a very specific link to like the fourth

538.959 --> 541.1999999999999
hour

546.839 --> 550.1600000000001
so you can check it out if you

561.6 --> 568.44
want but I mean it is really good

565.16 --> 571.12
like Owen is like really on to something

568.44 --> 571.12
here

571.88 --> 574.399
with his

578.519 --> 582.2
approach right so that

587.44 --> 590.44
happened

591.6 --> 597.519
uh oh Benjamin also started really late

594.6 --> 597.519
by the way and now we're

598.12 --> 602.12
late

600.2 --> 604.48
like in his own show did he which he

602.12 --> 604.48
still

606.839 --> 612.1600000000001
had and I think it was mostly

614.76 --> 617.92
continuing the

623.8 --> 627.1999999999999
theme let me

628.04 --> 633.36
see

629.839 --> 637.9200000000001
yeah the whole your inner Jew thing and

633.36 --> 640.279
it's really sensible and totally

637.92 --> 644.079
brilliant in relation to the path of

640.279 --> 647.279
Christ and it's just so

644.079 --> 648.959
basic and dynamic so yeah like I'm

647.279 --> 650.88
almost like oh I'm proud of Owen

648.959 --> 653.56
Benjamin no but he's just really

650.88 --> 657.6
crushing it right

653.56 --> 657.5999999999999
now it's found a really good

658.04 --> 661.04
message

665.88 --> 672.36
one was

667.8 --> 674.56
Christian well Owen isn't exactly

672.36 --> 678.0
Christian I

674.56 --> 681.399
mean is more like a Christian like how I

678.0 --> 684.519
am a Christian although he's doing

681.399 --> 687.959
different things though with his life

684.519 --> 690.2
although not even that different I mean

687.959 --> 693.2399999999999
just

690.2 --> 693.24
I'd say he's doing it

694.24 --> 701.16
better but uh I mean

698.24 --> 702.32
Owen you didn't know wow okay well I

701.16 --> 705.079
guess that none of you have really

702.32 --> 709.7600000000001
followed anything about him then or you

705.079 --> 709.76
at least cuz he's had like a

710.16 --> 717.639
giant back yeah

713.68 --> 720.12
struggle with like Christianity because

717.639 --> 721.9590000000001
he thinks that Jesus being his own

720.12 --> 725.2
father is

721.959 --> 727.16
ridiculous all that right I mean I've

725.2 --> 730.5600000000001
been basically echoing the same kind of

727.16 --> 730.56
things as he

731.44 --> 737.2790000000001
has it could even I can even just

734.48 --> 739.639
honestly say that I talked about those

737.279 --> 743.68
things because he brought it up because

739.639 --> 746.36
it's on my mind too it's

743.68 --> 748.279
just he's just really good at just like

746.36 --> 751.32
he just throws it out gets the whole

748.279 --> 754.48
Bee's neck go rent crazy and he just

751.32 --> 754.48
knows how to deal with

761.88 --> 767.959
that I mean I like to stick out with

764.44 --> 771.72
certain weird things but not like that

767.959 --> 771.7199999999999
just gets everybody angry or

775.839 --> 779.9200000000001
something right okay well fair enough

778.279 --> 782.8389999999999
you haven't really follow

779.92 --> 786.88
them but

782.839 --> 792.0790000000001
uh right a lot of what I do I do kind of

786.88 --> 792.079
like in his shadow I I fully admit

807.76 --> 810.76
it

810.959 --> 817.68
right but I mean Owen is not a Jesus

814.839 --> 820.0790000000001
denier absolutely not he's more like a

817.68 --> 822.959
follower of the

820.079 --> 826.3599999999999
path and he has

822.959 --> 829.68
this yeah this realization

826.36 --> 832.279
that like this Christianity we know now

829.68 --> 833.92
like it's it's kind of like delusional

832.279 --> 835.68
madeup

833.92 --> 839.759
crap

835.68 --> 842.4399999999999
but it's based really on the person that

839.759 --> 845.24
really existed did something amazing

842.44 --> 849.24
amazing and if you have the senses you

845.24 --> 853.32
can recognize that like it was like with

849.24 --> 856.12
God absolutely it's like a brilliant

853.32 --> 859.72
insights brilliant

856.12 --> 862.519
wisdom this is divine and Owen

859.72 --> 865.12
recognizes that too and like that's the

862.519 --> 868.199
whole thing is like try to do that and

865.12 --> 871.079
not follow the riddles of the priests

868.199 --> 872.7589999999999
and not obsessed with oh am I safe so I

871.079 --> 876.56
can just do whatever the hell I want

872.759 --> 877.86
even though it's just nasty or

876.56 --> 881.059
whatever

877.86 --> 881.059
[Music]

881.759 --> 889.279
right it and this was literally the my

886.839 --> 890.6800000000001
inner struggle like 20 years ago with

889.279 --> 895.16
Christi like

890.68 --> 897.399
I I just despised Christianity out there

895.16 --> 899.3199999999999
because everything I saw from it were

897.399 --> 902.279
people that were just drowning in their

899.32 --> 905.6
own corruption with

902.279 --> 908.68
it it's what made me think like yeah

905.6 --> 911.0
yeah well maybe I'm a Satanist then I

908.68 --> 913.3199999999999
didn't know what the hell that actually

911.0 --> 914.48
implied for real I just thought like oh

913.32 --> 917.48
yeah I'm the

914.48 --> 920.16
opposer I'm like oh yeah I'm not with

917.48 --> 921.44
that [ __ ] you guys you're you're a whole

920.16 --> 926.199
bunch of

921.44 --> 928.759
Hypocrites like I'll just do good when I

926.199 --> 930.8389999999999
do good and when I can and and not like

928.759 --> 934.1990000000001
like always be like Oh I'm the good one

930.839 --> 938.639
I'm the good one really do what I

934.199 --> 942.079
say like [ __ ] off don't tell me how to

938.639 --> 942.0790000000001
interpret what's in that

945.24 --> 954.12
book cuz when I first got Bible read to

949.279 --> 956.6
me and all that as a kid like I had all

954.12 --> 958.24
these visions that I got out of it I

956.6 --> 959.6800000000001
don't even remember the details it

958.24 --> 962.839
justed happen it's kind of like what

959.68 --> 964.56
happens now it's like this oracl and it

962.839 --> 966.36
it just happened I got all this vision

964.56 --> 968.319
and all this insight about Christ and

966.36 --> 971.6
about how we so misunderstood and all

968.319 --> 974.8389999999999
that which is literally not in the book

971.6 --> 978.48
that's not said in the book it's just I

974.839 --> 981.6
got that out of it as a kid

978.48 --> 984.6800000000001
naturally and

981.6 --> 991.16
then the Christians out

984.68 --> 991.16
there they they did not accept that at

996.199 --> 1001.8389999999999
all perhaps my dad did because weirdly

999.88 --> 1005.88
enough this is going to sound kind of

1001.839 --> 1009.839
Sur I have to like ask him but my dad

1005.88 --> 1012.8389999999999
was like had a real affin Affinity with

1009.839 --> 1016.0790000000001
Christianity and real respect for

1012.839 --> 1018.2790000000001
Christ and he he was like aware that

1016.079 --> 1021.399
Society was cracking down on it through

1018.279 --> 1024.24
me media and all that more but he's just

1021.399 --> 1029.24
like he had like this mini truther in

1024.24 --> 1030.959
him but he he never shared it he like

1029.24 --> 1034.679
never shared it sometimes he tried to

1030.959 --> 1036.439
make decisions to make us avoid hazards

1034.679 --> 1039.48
that way that we didn't understand in

1036.439 --> 1041.919
that sense he was a good dad but he like

1039.48 --> 1044.0
never really like put it

1041.919 --> 1046.88
down for

1044.0 --> 1050.44
us like not even for my

1046.88 --> 1053.3200000000002
mom but he was in a way in his own way

1050.44 --> 1055.6000000000001
like a follower of the path cuz he took

1053.32 --> 1058.3999999999999
it very serious and he kind of knew like

1055.6 --> 1061.3999999999999
the the opponent the devil is everywhere

1058.4 --> 1064.88
like including in us like including in

1061.4 --> 1067.039
him and including in me and my mom like

1064.88 --> 1071.24
he he kind of understood all these

1067.039 --> 1071.24
things he just kept it all to himself so

1077.4 --> 1081.2800000000002
much

1079.44 --> 1083.919
right

1081.28 --> 1087.08
but with all these struggles me thinking

1083.919 --> 1090.4
I'm a Satanist like sliding off with the

1087.08 --> 1092.1589999999999
really terrible people

1090.4 --> 1095.3200000000002
and

1092.159 --> 1098.24
yeah things going very badly because of

1095.32 --> 1100.96
that leaving like massive psychological

1098.24 --> 1100.96
scars on

1102.039 --> 1110.32
me well not

1104.72 --> 1110.32
no it not scar it just screwed things up

1112.76 --> 1119.559
up spiritually for me and I screwed it

1116.64 --> 1123.1200000000001
up it's just that I was so sick of

1119.559 --> 1125.72
everything being not what it seemed like

1123.12 --> 1129.28
I got sick of the world

1125.72 --> 1130.64
man as I slided on with the satanists

1129.28 --> 1134.6399999999999
thinking that I was doing the right

1130.64 --> 1134.64
thing I just got so sick of the

1135.48 --> 1141.76
world how [ __ ] hypocritical like

1138.88 --> 1144.1200000000001
everything is that like every person I

1141.76 --> 1147.2
could find a hypocrisy

1144.12 --> 1150.6399999999999
in like so easily

1147.2 --> 1152.679
like it was just I was like just getting

1150.64 --> 1154.4
a much more negative view on the world

1152.679 --> 1156.48
because of it and didn't lead to

1154.4 --> 1157.799
anything productive and I wasn't being

1156.48 --> 1162.679
even

1157.799 --> 1164.9189999999999
respected for it by

1162.679 --> 1166.679
satanists I started to notice that every

1164.919 --> 1168.8400000000001
time I was renting they would listen

1166.679 --> 1172.159
like ideologically listen

1168.84 --> 1174.799
but they were always just like hoping

1172.159 --> 1176.7600000000002
rooting for me to like collapse under

1174.799 --> 1179.72
the misery or

1176.76 --> 1182.1589999999999
something like they never gave me any

1179.72 --> 1183.52
like positive twist advice or like how

1182.159 --> 1186.5200000000002
to get out of

1183.52 --> 1186.52
it

1188.48 --> 1195.48
like so I'm just glad I'm not there

1192.799 --> 1198.6399999999999
anymore I mean when I got into Flat

1195.48 --> 1202.76
Earth I I literally like dropped the

1198.64 --> 1202.76
last lines to

1204.0 --> 1209.559
that sort

1206.159 --> 1213.0390000000002
of at the surface soft

1209.559 --> 1216.8799999999999
Satanism but that was still like

1213.039 --> 1218.64
connected to actual Satanism indirectly

1216.88 --> 1220.8400000000001
and

1218.64 --> 1223.3200000000002
directly in

1220.84 --> 1226.84
ways I

1223.32 --> 1229.52
mean they like they knew or they would

1226.84 --> 1232.1999999999998
like deny like blatantly deny but

1229.52 --> 1235.4
thereby still know you could see it like

1232.2 --> 1235.4
that these things are out

1236.12 --> 1243.36
there like I try to leak some of my

1240.039 --> 1245.36
experiences with these friends that are

1243.36 --> 1248.84
kind of like soft Satanist it's very

1245.36 --> 1251.4399999999998
comparable to sjws and all that kind of

1248.84 --> 1251.4399999999998
is in

1251.799 --> 1256.72
ways the only difference is that that

1254.6 --> 1258.3999999999999
they didn't attempt to just look

1256.72 --> 1260.88
atrocious that's the only only

1258.4 --> 1263.76
difference they had like Gothic style

1260.88 --> 1266.8400000000001
and not like oh let's look like

1263.76 --> 1270.12
atrocities at least but they were always

1266.84 --> 1273.1589999999999
so very freaking accepting of that I was

1270.12 --> 1273.1589999999999
just repulsed by

1277.96 --> 1283.8400000000001
that

1280.2 --> 1283.8400000000001
anyway I'm rambling

1286.32 --> 1290.52
on right but I

1293.6 --> 1300.6399999999999
mean since Flat Earth I've been able to

1296.52 --> 1303.8799999999999
cut the ties and just like really

1300.64 --> 1306.7990000000002
become in my own frequency

1303.88 --> 1309.0800000000002
again because when I jumped to it I was

1306.799 --> 1312.559
so scared but it's like jumping to a

1309.08 --> 1316.76
very early platform except the platform

1312.559 --> 1318.8799999999999
wasn't there when I was young was no

1316.76 --> 1321.72
nobody no group nothing thing to step to

1318.88 --> 1321.72
there wasn't even an

1323.72 --> 1329.48
internet back then I thought Oh I

1326.279 --> 1332.88
thought I was like I'm one of the few

1329.48 --> 1334.96
last people that even understand this

1332.88 --> 1337.7990000000002
that's how it

1334.96 --> 1339.72
felt like getting told like you can't

1337.799 --> 1342.279
talk to this

1339.72 --> 1344.24
openly about this with other people

1342.279 --> 1348.52
because they will go

1344.24 --> 1350.52
crazy like that's scary to hear that if

1348.52 --> 1352.8799999999999
you're like a little

1350.52 --> 1355.6399999999999
kid especially if you're a little kid

1352.88 --> 1359.3600000000001
that isn't just like kind of like

1355.64 --> 1360.8400000000001
quickly adult and like just logical and

1359.36 --> 1364.24
based

1360.84 --> 1366.9189999999999
and but a kind of a dreamy kid as well a

1364.24 --> 1371.159
dreamy kid that couldn't really handle

1366.919 --> 1374.24
the harsher side of realities too much

1371.159 --> 1377.5590000000002
yeah so for me technically getting to

1374.24 --> 1380.48
here like here's this like this radical

1377.559 --> 1382.279
brill brilliant inside it's magical like

1380.48 --> 1386.1200000000001
all everything is inside out it's

1382.279 --> 1388.919
actually flat and like this is how they

1386.12 --> 1391.279
trick with things and then to basically

1388.919 --> 1393.2
find out as you yeah figure out this

1391.279 --> 1395.84
magical new world like yeah oh and if

1393.2 --> 1398.0
you talk about it with everybody they'll

1395.84 --> 1402.6
like treat you like an

1398.0 --> 1406.159
animal that was just such a nightmare to

1402.6 --> 1411.6789999999999
me so terrible like that was like you're

1406.159 --> 1411.679
punishing me by telling me this is then

1412.76 --> 1418.32
almost and then yeah I get information

1416.36 --> 1420.4399999999998
like that i' carried it around I could

1418.32 --> 1423.48
get obsessed with it very

1420.44 --> 1425.0
quickly and just like like I can't talk

1423.48 --> 1426.919
about this I can't talk about it and

1425.0 --> 1431.0
guess what would

1426.919 --> 1434.4
happen I would just explode on some

1431.0 --> 1436.52
person about it and almost pick somebody

1434.4 --> 1439.039
that would I would know wouldn't be able

1436.52 --> 1441.559
to handle it it's just like

1439.039 --> 1441.559
that would

1442.12 --> 1446.36
happen because I just couldn't handle it

1444.84 --> 1447.12
yeah and then everything went wrong and

1446.36 --> 1450.1999999999998
I

1447.12 --> 1452.4799999999998
would why did it happen to me and then

1450.2 --> 1455.0800000000002
that terrible feelings and all that I

1452.48 --> 1459.08
would literally just use it to [ __ ]

1455.08 --> 1461.72
erase it from my mind the horrible

1459.08 --> 1461.72
horrible

1462.08 --> 1469.799
knowledge that turns everybody against

1466.799 --> 1469.799
you

1471.36 --> 1478.52
yeah but unless I'd actually like bump

1475.159 --> 1480.24
it into somebody and like told them and

1478.52 --> 1481.8799999999999
they can't handle and they attack me for

1480.24 --> 1485.0
it and shave me for me and like

1481.88 --> 1488.0
massively so I feel really [ __ ]

1485.0 --> 1490.52
terrible like I deserve to die

1488.0 --> 1493.12
terrible if I wouldn't do that I'd just

1490.52 --> 1496.76
be [ __ ] obsessed all the time with

1493.12 --> 1499.76
the taboo information in my

1496.76 --> 1499.76
head

1509.2 --> 1516.72
right anyway it's it sucked it made me

1513.24 --> 1519.559
afraid of Flat Earth when I was a kid

1516.72 --> 1525.039
because people would just go freaking

1519.559 --> 1528.2
insane and like violent like like FR to

1525.039 --> 1532.1589999999999
little kids even like is just

1528.2 --> 1534.72
like like you're [ __ ] you're the

1532.159 --> 1536.1200000000001
devil like suddenly instead of a little

1534.72 --> 1538.559
kid that you need to be careful with

1536.12 --> 1541.0
you're a monster all of a sudden yeah

1538.559 --> 1543.559
that's how [ __ ] [ __ ] up Flat Earth

1541.0 --> 1544.72
and knowing about it is when you're a

1543.559 --> 1547.44
little

1544.72 --> 1551.08
kid in this

1547.44 --> 1551.0800000000002

1611.84 --> 1617.279
well there were I never personally

1614.32 --> 1620.72
touched any of it even later but there

1617.279 --> 1621.52
were Flat Earth books books from the 70s

1620.72 --> 1624.66
and all

1621.52 --> 1624.66
[Music]

1624.96 --> 1633.08

my mother died he kind of made the book

1635.88 --> 1640.1200000000001
disappear yeah oh yeah that was the

1638.039 --> 1643.96
thing too that guy would literally go

1640.12 --> 1648.6789999999999
around and just steal

1643.96 --> 1651.88
stuff specifically to like

1648.679 --> 1653.6000000000001
remove information like in in moments of

1651.88 --> 1658.0800000000002
trauma he would go around and just

1653.6 --> 1661.039
snatch away things pictures books to

1681.679 --> 1686.919
religious version of Flat Earth I don't

1684.519 --> 1689.559
even know what country that was

1954.639 --> 1959.76
Flat Earth numpties need to support each

1957.039 --> 1961.639
other too otherwise the world might get

1959.76 --> 1965.12
the impression that they're completely

1961.639 --> 1968.08
useless and that the flat earthers are

1965.12 --> 1970.6789999999999
winning they have to invest vast amount

1968.08 --> 1975.12
of resources to keep their fellow

1970.679 --> 1975.1200000000001
[ __ ] retards AF flat don't you

the economy too despite being all in the

2017.36 --> 2022.9189999999999
your fellow comrades I could really use

2020.08 --> 2022.9189999999999
some support

2023.6 --> 2031.4399999999998
here my financial situation

2027.2 --> 2035.32
is not great I'm kind of surprised I'm

2031.44 --> 2037.96
being able to keep it stable with like

2035.32 --> 2042.12
emergency supports and all that

2037.96 --> 2043.96
that and the prices are just terrible

there not there's no indication it's

2043.96 --> 2050.56
getting better our government is

the feeling from some of the signs out

2065.96 --> 2068.879
there in the Netherlands

2069.879 --> 2076.679
and I mean to literally fix the

2072.839 --> 2079.72
situation is done very

2076.679 --> 2083.599
quickly so as soon as pretty much

2079.72 --> 2086.919

2083.599 --> 2090.28
Traders take control this they can like

2086.919 --> 2092.72
look like Heroes immediately and fixing

2090.28 --> 2095.44
the situation like very

2092.72 --> 2099.3199999999997
quickly and I'm really waiting for that

2095.44 --> 2102.839
who the [ __ ] is finally going to make

2099.32 --> 2105.44
the move and set this situation

2102.839 --> 2108.52
straight yeah and bring the prices back

2105.44 --> 2108.52
down like

2110.64 --> 2115.2799999999997
immediately like if that happens my

2113.32 --> 2117.88
situation is

2115.28 --> 2120.44
fixed no more what like no more

2117.88 --> 2124.839
waterfalls of of begging because it's

2120.44 --> 2127.7200000000003
like ah I've run out because before that

2124.839 --> 2129.839
giant price hike happened cuz the

2127.72 --> 2132.48
northstream 2 got blown

2129.839 --> 2136.32
up by America

2132.48 --> 2138.48
yeah or Ukraine or whatever that was

2136.32 --> 2140.48
obviously not Russia since then like

2138.48 --> 2142.72
just the pric has gone completely

2140.48 --> 2144.119
apeshit here especially in the

2142.72 --> 2147.16
Netherlands like the Netherlands is like

2144.119 --> 2150.359
the worst of all the freaking European

2147.16 --> 2154.56
countries being hit by

2150.359 --> 2155.7999999999997
this and it's been just hell financially

2154.56 --> 2158.7999999999997
ever

2155.8 --> 2158.8
since

2160.599 --> 2167.3590000000004
debt gradually increasing it's a miracle

2163.92 --> 2167.359
I'm still AF flat with

2171.52 --> 2176.079
this but yeah I really hope that there's

2174.28 --> 2178.119
going to be this move I mean I don't

2176.079 --> 2180.52
know if I'm going to survive this

2178.119 --> 2180.52
another

2180.96 --> 2184.92
year the setup it's

2185.24 --> 2190.4799999999996
just like I'm starting to feel guilty

2187.839 --> 2193.44
for even get getting that support that I

2190.48 --> 2197.839
need at this point cuz it's like

2193.44 --> 2197.839
yeah I don't know how to get out of

2200.72 --> 2206.8799999999997
this but I'm really glad I that people

2203.88 --> 2208.52
do still support me even though

2206.88 --> 2213.04
sometimes I have to like beg like a

2208.52 --> 2213.04

that and how you should all support me

2241.319 --> 2245.52

actually getting it in Spain and to the

Netherlands to my mom's house

2818.559 --> 2823.3590000000004
my coffee cup more reliable than

2820.88 --> 2823.359
Nathan's

2824.28 --> 2830.76
PC because it's old Tech gzilla old Tech

2829.319 --> 2833.4
you

2830.76 --> 2836.4
know people go for the new stuff because

2833.4 --> 2839.92
it's more and faster but people forget

2836.4 --> 2842.2400000000002
old Tech tends to be more stable and

2839.92 --> 2842.2400000000002
more

2842.27 --> 2846.48
[Music]

2843.64 --> 2848.839
durable it's like oh I got the latest

2846.48 --> 2852.119
thing oh it's all these problems like oh

2848.839 --> 2855.119
you want any you want something

2852.119 --> 2857.76
better get a one get a part of the same

2855.119 --> 2859.88
type that's two years

2857.76 --> 2863.28
older problem

2859.88 --> 2865.8
solved serious I mean that's kind of

2863.28 --> 2868.559
becoming a rule of fist now it always

2865.8 --> 2871.599
has been it's just

2868.559 --> 2873.2400000000002
that I just feel the way that the

2871.599 --> 2877.6800000000003
computer electronics and all that have

2873.24 --> 2881.4799999999996
been developed you know is just they

2877.68 --> 2884.2
instead of like really slowly finding

2881.48 --> 2886.88
new frequencies new depths for the

2884.2 --> 2889.5989999999997
entire design they just keep beefing it

2886.88 --> 2889.599
up and up and

2890.359 --> 2895.64
up and it it's all basically to me it

2893.52 --> 2898.2
just feels like the chips are almost the

2895.64 --> 2901.1189999999997
same chips except now they're on

2898.2 --> 2903.5989999999997
steroids and but that's not a good thing

2901.119 --> 2906.6800000000003
because they're like on steroids is not

2903.599 --> 2908.92
good it's like not natural

2906.68 --> 2915.5589999999997
it's going to go

2908.92 --> 2915.559
wrong yeah on steroids is not natural

2918.88 --> 2923.96
so for me it's like computers like no I

2924.119 --> 2931.52
just it doesn't have to be a 100 times

2928.4 --> 2934.0
quicker it's really cute idea it never

2931.52 --> 2936.319
exists it will never happen though it's

2934.0 --> 2938.559
just no

2936.319 --> 2940.88
all that wishful

2938.559 --> 2943.96
thinking all you're doing is just

2940.88 --> 2946.599
putting your computer on more drugs it's

2943.96 --> 2946.599
going to burn

2951.559 --> 2956.96
out and that's how how I've treated my

2954.52 --> 2960.4
computer always and that's why my

2956.96 --> 2960.4
computer lives so damn

2962.119 --> 2968.76
long and is like functional like never

2965.68 --> 2972.2
gives me issues really it really never

2968.76 --> 2974.44
does like not even small ones all the

2972.2 --> 2980.04
issues I get are my problems like

2974.44 --> 2980.04
because I'm just not good at computers

2980.28 --> 2985.3590000000004
anymore man I was GR in computers

2985.68 --> 2989.2799999999997
like 10 years

2990.28 --> 2998.2000000000003
ago 20 years ago not 20 years ago I was

2994.599 --> 3001.1600000000003
like pretty I really got it back then

2998.2 --> 3003.48
but I mean it's like just there's so

3001.16 --> 3006.2799999999997
much the developments really never never

3003.48 --> 3008.119
stopped so I

3006.28 --> 3010.599
just I'm

3008.119 --> 3012.7200000000003
outdated now I know how my brother feels

3010.599 --> 3015.76
he was a programmer and he told me he

3012.72 --> 3017.52
was outdated like 20 years ago it's like

3015.76 --> 3019.7200000000003
yeah everything I learned got so good at

3017.52 --> 3023.28
it it's just

3019.72 --> 3026.5589999999997
like it's like there's already newer

3023.28 --> 3029.52
things that are just like way better

3026.559 --> 3033.119
and I'm like like yeah I just can't

3029.52 --> 3033.119
can't do this all over

3033.799 --> 3038.72
again that's when he kind of retired

3036.079 --> 3042.4
from programming and went to he started

3038.72 --> 3042.3999999999996
his own company doing

3044.76 --> 3049.6800000000003
puzzles like physical puzzles

3050.92 --> 3054.0
anyway what the hell are you guys

3052.96 --> 3056.559
talking

3054.0 --> 3058.68
about we're having two conversations

3056.559 --> 3061.079
here the conversation that Arwin is

3058.68 --> 3063.04
having with his against a so-called

3061.079 --> 3067.0
audience that's really not paying

3063.04 --> 3070.079
attention at all and then there's Nathan

3067.0 --> 3074.04
and and Tim having a conversation about

3070.079 --> 3076.76
his computer right

3074.04 --> 3079.7599999999998
still now you're talking

3076.76 --> 3079.76
about

3084.359 --> 3087.359
what

3089.44 --> 3093.2000000000003
what the hell are you talking about

3090.76 --> 3093.2000000000003
gzilla

3099.68 --> 3106.64
it all goes to one stomach what what are

3103.88 --> 3106.6400000000003
you talking

3108.119 --> 3114.359
about

3110.359 --> 3117.7599999999998
this this is just you're just like

3114.359 --> 3119.5589999999997
being rtic for no damn reason now I just

3117.76 --> 3121.559
like I know none what the [ __ ] are you

3119.559 --> 3123.76
guys talking about I'm going to start

3121.559 --> 3126.799
timing people out until unless you start

3123.76 --> 3126.7990000000004
to make freaking

3133.52 --> 3138.04
sense hello Dr utar by the

3144.28 --> 3148.799
way

3146.13 --> 3151.28
[Music]

3148.799 --> 3154.28
Tim said something in

3151.28 --> 3154.28
Dutch

3165.799 --> 3169.68
where what are you talking

3173.799 --> 3179.24
about did oh he said that I didn't see

3176.64 --> 3182.5989999999997
him say that but uh yeah just just for

3179.24 --> 3187.9599999999996
the record that's not logical

3182.599 --> 3187.96
Dutch nobody's ever said that in the

3195.72 --> 3202.04
Netherlands that's not the way you say

3198.52 --> 3204.839
things in Dutch you see there many

3202.04 --> 3209.16
different ways you can say the same

3204.839 --> 3211.5589999999997
thing in Dutch just like English that

3209.16 --> 3213.8799999999997
the way that that is rolled out yeah a

3211.559 --> 3216.119
translator will be able to decipher it

3213.88 --> 3218.2000000000003
what it want decipher is like hey a

3216.119 --> 3220.28
Dutch person would never say it like

3218.2 --> 3223.48
that yeah that's something that Google

3220.28 --> 3226.119
translate can't tell you Dutch person

3223.48 --> 3228.559
never says something they wouldn't say

3226.119 --> 3228.559
it like

3229.72 --> 3237.1189999999997
that we did wouldn't say come

3234.16 --> 3240.1189999999997
com we would

3237.119 --> 3243.04
say

3240.119 --> 3246.6800000000003
goes that's how the Dutch would choose

3243.04 --> 3248.92
their words differently cuz this is

3246.68 --> 3252.16
clunky

3248.92 --> 3255.6800000000003
Dutch it's probably how some of my

3252.16 --> 3259.1189999999997
English sounds to you guys because I bet

3255.68 --> 3260.7599999999998
that I do clunky English too ways that

3259.119 --> 3264.839
are like

3260.76 --> 3268.6400000000003
unusual to say say things like right I I

3264.839 --> 3272.52
do it I try to avoid I try to always

3268.64 --> 3274.7599999999998
find like logical natural English ways

3272.52 --> 3276.52
and American ways to say things but

3274.76 --> 3278.88
sometimes I just can't figure it out and

3276.52 --> 3281.16
then it's like kind of like constructed

3278.88 --> 3285.599
in a bit of a weird

3281.16 --> 3288.319
way and yeah pretty much all people that

3285.599 --> 3290.04
aren't Dutch do that with the Dutch

3288.319 --> 3293.2799999999997
language whenever they try to say

3290.04 --> 3296.24
something Dutch cuz they don't get that

3293.28 --> 3298.7200000000003
there's very specific way way you should

3296.24 --> 3302.4399999999996
be saying

3298.72 --> 3304.9599999999996
it and like we can't elaborate further

3302.44 --> 3307.559
on that it's just you just have to get

3304.96 --> 3311.2
it if you don't if you're not Dutch you

3307.559 --> 3314.559
just don't get it we can't tell you why

3311.2 --> 3318.16
we can only tell you how it

3314.559 --> 3319.52
is and that's probably part partly why

3318.16 --> 3323.5989999999997
Dutch is like one of the most

3319.52 --> 3323.599
complicated languages in the world

3324.0 --> 3327.92
officially

3327.92 --> 3332.559
cuz yeah you can construct everything

3329.92 --> 3334.119
with it probably just like English it's

3332.559 --> 3337.2000000000003
just

3334.119 --> 3339.839
that if you're not a Dutch person you're

3337.2 --> 3341.96
going to do it in a non-dutch way and

3339.839 --> 3343.88
every Dutch person will recognize that

3341.96 --> 3346.039
about you we can immediately spot a

3343.88 --> 3349.48
non-dutch person using the Dutch

3346.039 --> 3349.48
language we just

3354.0 --> 3357.0
can

3364.48 --> 3370.68
anyway Tim is just [ __ ] out of his

3367.64 --> 3370.68
neck I

3371.48 --> 3376.28
what I don't know what that means maybe

3373.72 --> 3378.68
it's just really triggered by the by the

3376.28 --> 3378.6800000000003
title

3381.28 --> 3386.799
today I didn't even I haven't even

3383.88 --> 3389.559
talked about Globe Earth the

3386.799 --> 3392.0389999999998
storytelling confidence-based pyramid

3389.559 --> 3394.1600000000003
scheme but it just sitting there

3392.039 --> 3396.3190000000004
probably like just pulled him in here

3394.16 --> 3400.799
it's like oh

3396.319 --> 3400.799
no no that's that's way too

3401.039 --> 3408.119
aesthetic that's not

3403.839 --> 3413.68
good huh this Tomer coffe is

3408.119 --> 3413.6800000000003
uh kind of nice having it on the show

3413.88 --> 3416.88
again

3417.24 --> 3422.319
there's more of these super cold days

3419.319 --> 3425.64
I'll probably do that but only if I have

3422.319 --> 3427.72
an Illuminati CA alongside of it because

3425.64 --> 3430.0
if I have to take that coffee on an

3427.72 --> 3432.48
empty stomach and not immediately eat

3430.0 --> 3435.319
lunch with it that's probably going to

3432.48 --> 3435.319
fall very

3435.52 --> 3443.52
bad little iic yeah that's an actual

3439.68 --> 3446.319
Dutch way of saying it that's like flat

3443.52 --> 3448.92
or uh

3446.319 --> 3448.92
we call that

3449.119 --> 3456.839
plot it's like the common

3452.48 --> 3460.44
tongue of of saying you're talking

3456.839 --> 3464.0389999999998
[ __ ] that's exactly the the saying that

3460.44 --> 3466.0
that people the common folk here that

3464.039 --> 3468.4
are a bit rough rough

3466.0 --> 3473.079
mouthed and how they would say it like

3468.4 --> 3473.079
you're talking [ __ ] you Lo out your

3473.799 --> 3476.799
neck

3488.92 --> 3491.9990000000003
[Music]

3494.52 --> 3500.599
[ __ ] out of their neck yeah well

3498.68 --> 3502.799
that's it's kind of funny right because

3500.599 --> 3506.319
Len is like

3502.799 --> 3510.0389999999998
talking like blabber

3506.319 --> 3512.92
in L out your neck is like blabbering

3510.039 --> 3516.119
out of your neck but we use dick L is

3512.92 --> 3517.799
also penis basically so it's you're yeah

3516.119 --> 3521.319
you're [ __ ] out of your neck that's

3517.799 --> 3521.319
basically what that kind of

3529.119 --> 3536.7200000000003
means you're talking your ass

3533.48 --> 3539.0
off yeah could mean that Godzilla but

3536.72 --> 3542.3999999999996
it's like extra emphasizing on the

3539.0 --> 3545.24
endless amount of chattering that way it

3542.4 --> 3547.6800000000003
when you Lo out your neck can also mean

3545.24 --> 3551.24
you're just talking horeshit you're like

3547.68 --> 3554.0789999999997
not making sense you're broken logic

3551.24 --> 3556.359
right not about the oh it's never stops

3554.079 --> 3558.48
no it's just you're just wrong you're

3556.359 --> 3562.2799999999997
just talking [ __ ] that's why I said

3558.48 --> 3565.16
you're talking [ __ ] and not you're

3562.28 --> 3568.7200000000003
talking endless amounts like your ass

3565.16 --> 3572.44
off which is like and that your ass off

3568.72 --> 3574.72
typically indicates endless amounts

3572.44 --> 3576.2400000000002
right I like

3574.72 --> 3578.52
these

3576.24 --> 3581.52
these language

3578.52 --> 3581.52
technical

3587.48 --> 3596.64
conversations LLY is also penis in Hindi

3591.76 --> 3596.6400000000003
what what Dang

3596.76 --> 3599.7200000000003
connections are just

3600.4 --> 3603.4
everywhere

3610.599 --> 3615.2000000000003
incredible right anyway I hope you're

3612.48 --> 3615.2
all enjoying the

3619.09 --> 3622.119
[Music]

3623.559 --> 3627.76
show

3625.48 --> 3630.4
it's kind of fun to have Nathan and Adam

3627.76 --> 3630.4
in the chat

3641.45 --> 3644.6499999999996
[Music]

3653.52 --> 3656.52
here

3674.28 --> 3682.8390000000004
what why not just say ruive

3677.88 --> 3682.839
then because ruy is so much more

3683.44 --> 3686.44
fun

3692.4 --> 3698.559
and I mean with a voice like that he

3694.72 --> 3698.5589999999997
does kind of put you to sleep doesn't

3702.92 --> 3709.6800000000003
he and he does have that look like oh

3706.64 --> 3712.92
[ __ ] that's a guy you don't want to fall

3709.68 --> 3718.0
asleep around if you know what I

3712.92 --> 3718.0
mean so I think think ruy is just very

3725.59 --> 3728.909
[Music]

3736.25 --> 3739.449
[Music]

3743.359 --> 3746.359
appropriate

3756.73 --> 3759.929
[Music]

3767.799 --> 3773.359
turn it back into a

3769.799 --> 3776.359
globe what did he say that all the time

3773.359 --> 3776.359
when

3778.16 --> 3785.0389999999998
you R hiff out your neck

3782.48 --> 3788.4
no that's

3785.039 --> 3788.4
funny but

3791.3 --> 3797.75
[Music]

3803.279 --> 3806.279
no

3812.52 --> 3817.0
yes the

3813.599 --> 3818.92
cylinder Nathan and the cylinder is

3817.0 --> 3820.799
it you

3818.92 --> 3823.799
see that

3820.799 --> 3826.64
cylinder that's the

3823.799 --> 3828.88
realm except it's not actually a

3826.64 --> 3832.52
cylinder it

3828.88 --> 3835.6800000000003
just happens to be a looping rectangular

3832.52 --> 3839.799
square that interconnects like a

3835.68 --> 3839.799
cylinder except it's all flat and

3841.799 --> 3846.7599999999998
parallel every time in relation to Earth

3844.799 --> 3851.4
and Earth shape I hear a cylinder I'm

3846.76 --> 3854.3590000000004
like Yay cuz that's it guys every time

3851.4 --> 3856.7200000000003
you see anything cosmogeny related with

3854.359 --> 3860.4
the Earth and there's a cylinder

3856.72 --> 3860.3999999999996
involved that's the

3861.72 --> 3868.9199999999996
one it's going to be the most most

3865.279 --> 3871.359
accurate scale wise in relation to one

3868.92 --> 3871.359
part to

3871.76 --> 3878.3590000000004
another every

3874.359 --> 3881.96
time why would that be why would one

3878.359 --> 3885.7599999999998
typical form of a projection always be

3881.96 --> 3887.96
the most accurate well maybe because

3885.76 --> 3891.5200000000004
it's the most

3887.96 --> 3894.559
accurate yeah this is my intuitive

3891.52 --> 3896.24
conclusion from basically B digging

3894.559 --> 3899.7200000000003
through Flat Earth

3896.24 --> 3901.24
stuff and other people digging through

3899.72 --> 3902.8799999999997
Flat Earth basically digging through

3901.24 --> 3905.1189999999997
people's heads that are digging through

3902.88 --> 3907.319
flatter Earth stuff and this is where

3905.119 --> 3907.319
I'm

3909.279 --> 3914.68
at that's not accurate it's just a

3912.119 --> 3916.76
projection from a

3914.68 --> 3921.16
ball yeah but it

3916.76 --> 3921.1600000000003
isn't that's just what they make out of

3923.079 --> 3926.079
it

3937.839 --> 3940.44
one more

3943.76 --> 3949.3190000000004
cater wait what are we talking about the

3946.319 --> 3949.319
same scroll

3952.24 --> 3958.319
then right look if you're just talking

3954.96 --> 3960.559
yeah okay I'm not good enough at this I

3958.319 --> 3963.5589999999997
guess I didn't

3960.559 --> 3965.88
follow I mean there's several different

3963.559 --> 3967.2400000000002
ways right to basically create these

3965.88 --> 3969.52
Maps the different

3967.24 --> 3972.359
projections not saying that all of them

3969.52 --> 3975.48
that have a scroll are

3972.359 --> 3978.96
correct I just know

3975.48 --> 3978.96
that there's a

3981.079 --> 3986.039
few they're rectangular and they are the

3984.079 --> 3989.039
most

3986.039 --> 3992.3190000000004
accurate they're always more accurate

3989.039 --> 3992.3190000000004
than the freaking dis

3992.559 --> 3999.4
Maps scale relations because it's all

3996.24 --> 3999.3999999999996
about the scale

3999.44 --> 4006.44
relations how is one part of the

4003.0 --> 4008.599
projection hold up scale-wise compared

4006.44 --> 4011.279
to another part are they the same scale

4008.599 --> 4014.6400000000003
how much are they

4011.279 --> 4018.079
alike how close are they

4014.64 --> 4021.92
and the greater the deviation the less

4018.079 --> 4021.92
accurate the projection actually

4023.839 --> 4027.88
is the more distorted it

4028.88 --> 4036.079
is and I always thought that well the

4032.44 --> 4038.799
rectangular maps are always the best

4036.079 --> 4040.799
ones they're always the ones that are

4038.799 --> 4042.92
too skill the most but I mean there are

4040.799 --> 4045.599
like super distorted

4042.92 --> 4047.88
ones especially what what is it the the

4045.599 --> 4050.4
older one I don't I don't know the name

4047.88 --> 4054.079
so forgive me for

4050.4 --> 4056.839
that the parts where like Europe and

4054.079 --> 4061.119
North America and even Russia were like

4056.839 --> 4065.72
really exaggerated in size compared

4061.119 --> 4065.7200000000003
to like everything south of the

4072.92 --> 4075.92
Equator

4079.88 --> 4082.279
is that the

4084.64 --> 4088.839
Mercer they are all ball

4089.599 --> 4094.52
projections that's what the that's what

4091.799 --> 4094.52
the baller

4102.839 --> 4105.839
say

4128.679 --> 4136.4800000000005
Ah that's cool Adam yeah thanks for

4130.88 --> 4136.4800000000005
describing the merer projection that's

4146.719 --> 4151.6
interesting they're all ball projections

4149.44 --> 4154.04
right so are they like ball projections

4151.6 --> 4157.1990000000005
from the equator so there's like

4154.04 --> 4161.04
the so it's basically two half

4157.199 --> 4166.2789999999995
balls that are projected

4161.04 --> 4166.2789999999995
onto two Scrolls that are directly

4167.88 --> 4170.88
connected

4172.239 --> 4179.44
right cuz a tube can only you can

4175.799 --> 4181.6
only grit that out one side of the ball

4179.44 --> 4181.599999999999
of

4192.719 --> 4195.719
course

4211.76 --> 4217.4400000000005
I maybe you guys could talk like call in

4215.719 --> 4219.159
on Skype or something and we could

4217.44 --> 4221.5599999999995
actually have a conversation about these

4219.159 --> 4224.719
map projections instead of just me sort

4221.56 --> 4226.159000000001
of trying to guess it ing at the chat if

4224.719 --> 4229.36
there's going to be kind of a response

4226.159 --> 4229.36
from you guys how about

4242.679 --> 4245.679
that

4252.64 --> 4255.64
what

4263.159 --> 4268.799999999999
we are all ball

4265.52 --> 4268.8
projections that's

4276.12 --> 4282.4
hilarious not in rude

4279.08 --> 4282.4
okay too

4282.56 --> 4291.400000000001
bad I get it though I mean weather

4287.56 --> 4295.52
sucks I just had a cup of coffee

4291.4 --> 4295.5199999999995
though so I'm all hyped

4306.9 --> 4312.259
[Music]

4312.56 --> 4315.56
up

4325.51 --> 4328.689
[Music]

4343.199 --> 4346.96
all right I do enjoy by the way I'm glad

4345.28 --> 4351.639
that

4346.96 --> 4351.639
like people are coming back

4351.8 --> 4357.88
what on the FED panel because like all

4354.92 --> 4362.0
the silent moments been a bit

4357.88 --> 4362.0
annoying what play

4371.28 --> 4375.44
what fine

4377.199 --> 4382.4
okay but if you [ __ ]

4378.92 --> 4385.04
around with my blocked list and throw

4382.4 --> 4389.36
unwan people in there I will know it's

4385.04 --> 4389.36
you now Adam

4402.36 --> 4406.599999999999
Nathan

4404.0 --> 4406.6
yeah you got the

4421.679 --> 4427.0
ranches

4423.199 --> 4427.0
what just kidding

4427.48 --> 4431.36
guys why did it

4431.88 --> 4435.36
go never

4441.52 --> 4444.4400000000005
I don't know what's going

4446.88 --> 4452.76
on

4449.4 --> 4452.759999999999
ah what's

4460.199 --> 4465.28
that

4462.28 --> 4465.28
oh

4465.88 --> 4469.2390000000005
oh that's a very cool

4485.48 --> 4489.44
animation that's a really good

4492.28 --> 4495.28
video

4510.199 --> 4518.879999999999
except it's still like a ball

4513.84 --> 4518.88
so how does any of this make sense

4519.44 --> 4526.44
really can you guys explain that to me

4522.6 --> 4526.4400000000005
or is it not the right day for it I

4527.88 --> 4535.6
mean how can the Earth seem like this to

4532.4 --> 4539.719
be a ball when everything is flat can't

4535.6 --> 4542.639
be a ball and flat at the same time

4539.719 --> 4546.28
guys so how come that all these

4542.639 --> 4546.28
projections are all Globe

4549.88 --> 4554.639
projections derived from a flat plane

4552.48 --> 4559.5599999999995
arguably right

4554.639 --> 4559.56
but like what is the actual thing

4564.0 --> 4569.36
then what is this flat plane that a

4567.239 --> 4572.159
globe is

4569.36 --> 4574.5599999999995
being derived from that is then

4572.159 --> 4577.159
projected back onto a flat plane that we

4574.56 --> 4577.159000000001
know as a

4582.12 --> 4585.12
map

4601.6 --> 4604.4400000000005
what the hell you

4612.08 --> 4615.08
guys

4622.36 --> 4627.32
so could can either of you answer

4628.199 --> 4632.48
that immediately loses mod

4632.64 --> 4638.4800000000005
[Music]

4635.48 --> 4638.48
status

4639.52 --> 4645.4400000000005
no I mean I could just ban you and unban

4642.84 --> 4649.08
you the next day Nathan or I could give

4645.44 --> 4652.5199999999995
have somebody else give you a a 24-hour

4649.08 --> 4652.5199999999995
timeout how about

4658.159 --> 4663.4
that not sure of the confusion well my

4661.08 --> 4666.639
confusion is if there is these maps that

4663.4 --> 4666.638999999999
are basically ball

4667.0 --> 4673.44
projections how was that ball projection

4670.96 --> 4676.4800000000005
then created based off a flat plane and

4673.44 --> 4679.12
what is the flat plane that that ball

4676.48 --> 4683.879999999999
was constructed of that was

4679.12 --> 4686.88
then placed projected back onto a

4683.88 --> 4686.88
scroll

4691.56 --> 4697.639
like Jesus Christ Nathan like what the

4694.6 --> 4697.639
are you on crack or

4699.6 --> 4704.639
something are you like having a bad time

4702.28 --> 4708.0
now that you're computer's not broken

4704.639 --> 4711.6
and you you can't Tinker 20 hours

4708.0 --> 4711.6
straight are you on

4717.96 --> 4721.88
crack or is that just what coffee does

4720.52 --> 4727.320000000001
to

4721.88 --> 4729.76
you really sick oh okay so you're on

4727.32 --> 4734.92
robot usin then you're just

4729.76 --> 4734.92
hallucinating from the cough medicine

4738.88 --> 4741.12
in

4742.08 --> 4746.92
bed

4743.6 --> 4749.280000000001
okay get well soon and make sure you got

4746.92 --> 4749.28
vitamin

4754.0 --> 4758.76
C like I get sniffy I don't get sick

4756.96 --> 4761.84
like that anymore but then again you're

4758.76 --> 4764.84
are a parent and parents definitely

4761.84 --> 4764.84
do

4771.12 --> 4776.76
right

4772.56 --> 4780.400000000001
cuz kids don't know how to avoid getting

4776.76 --> 4783.400000000001
sick they seek it out so they radiate it

4780.4 --> 4785.879999999999
out as a parent you can be like in the

4783.4 --> 4787.44
know exactly how to avoid getting sick

4785.88 --> 4789.679
and like how

4787.44 --> 4793.32
to like

4789.679 --> 4795.4
brace and then not get sick pass through

4793.32 --> 4797.5599999999995
it but if your kids are there they don't

4795.4 --> 4799.679
do that so they disrupt all those

4797.56 --> 4802.080000000001
processes so you still get sick even if

4799.679 --> 4804.0
you do know how to avoid it and that's

4802.08 --> 4806.36
what usually happens when with people

4804.0 --> 4810.12
that get kids I have never seen a single

4806.36 --> 4812.88
exemption of that ever it's like if you

4810.12 --> 4815.76
get kids it's great but you're going to

4812.88 --> 4818.6
get sick pretty much no matter what you

4815.76 --> 4821.76
do cuz parents always freaking

4818.6 --> 4825.320000000001
do they always get

4821.76 --> 4829.52
sick when they're

4825.32 --> 4832.04
little like after like 12 or something

4829.52 --> 4834.639
maybe earlier like that stops

4832.04 --> 4837.199
happening it's like the adult mind

4834.639 --> 4838.32
starts to creep in and they start kids

4837.199 --> 4842.04
start to

4838.32 --> 4844.5199999999995
like take more personal responsibility

4842.04 --> 4847.28
and therefore grip on their own esoteric

4844.52 --> 4849.1990000000005
actions instead of just always fully

4847.28 --> 4851.28
surrendering everything that that comes

4849.199 --> 4853.32
out of them to their parents including

4851.28 --> 4855.759999999999
the pulses that distort

4853.32 --> 4858.5199999999995
the parents from stabilizing

4855.76 --> 4860.92
themselves against

4858.52 --> 4865.280000000001
sickness when you kind of turn 12 you

4860.92 --> 4865.28
stopped doing that as a kid or I did at

4868.04 --> 4874.32
least this is unfair I started

4870.92 --> 4874.32
late sorry

4876.0 --> 4880.84
teret what did you do duper hey

4881.639 --> 4885.679
duper I got ban banned what who who

4884.76 --> 4890.4800000000005
banned

4885.679 --> 4893.0
you Nathan could you go to the

4890.48 --> 4897.199
uh to YouTube

4893.0 --> 4897.199
studio and just unban

4898.36 --> 4905.08
him but duper duper is like this this

4902.48 --> 4907.08
guy that always just he's like the nerdy

4905.08 --> 4908.719
guy in the playground that just wants to

4907.08 --> 4910.36
play and everybody always freaking

4908.719 --> 4914.2390000000005
bullies

4910.36 --> 4915.96
him and he's a Ballard

4914.239 --> 4917.799999999999
but even if he wasn't a ball [ __ ] it

4915.96 --> 4920.6
would probably still happen just because

4917.8 --> 4923.6
of how he is it's just something about

4920.6 --> 4926.88
duper he always gets himself

4923.6 --> 4929.639
bullied and always people like like oh

4926.88 --> 4935.1990000000005
oh is nobody looking H ban

4929.639 --> 4935.1990000000005
him it's mean I don't like people doing

4936.199 --> 4943.159
that you're neutral on the [ __ ] right

4939.92 --> 4945.8
duper no there is no neutral

4943.159 --> 4948.638999999999
neutral means get the [ __ ] out you don't

4945.8 --> 4951.4800000000005
get involved that's neutral what you do

4948.639 --> 4956.639
is not neutral

4951.48 --> 4960.5599999999995
duber you're a bolard but that's

4956.639 --> 4963.84
okay bards are people

4960.56 --> 4968.96
too unless they let go of their humanity

4963.84 --> 4968.96
and let their ideology turn them into a

4971.56 --> 4974.56
demon

4975.32 --> 4979.92
yeah so if you want to do it right look

4977.88 --> 4984.08
to akumu

4979.92 --> 4986.159
virus that's how you be a proper Ballard

4984.08 --> 4990.4
Ballard are people

4986.159 --> 4992.879999999999
too yeah but it's true though you know

4990.4 --> 4995.5599999999995
not ballards are not just bad people

4992.88 --> 4999.1990000000005
because they're ballards it's just

4995.56 --> 5000.96
bardan is like an infliction right I

4999.199 --> 5003.638999999999
mean if you're mentally handicapped

5000.96 --> 5007.32
because you got hit on the head or or

5003.639 --> 5009.88
whatever as a kid or was in an

5007.32 --> 5013.719
accident and you're like you can't focus

5009.88 --> 5016.400000000001
anymore yeah is that the person's fault

5013.719 --> 5017.96
no maybe it was but still I mean you

5016.4 --> 5019.879999999999
can't really blame the rest of their

5017.96 --> 5022.199
lives for

5019.88 --> 5024.4800000000005
just getting into an accident or

5022.199 --> 5025.919999999999
something right so it's just they're

5024.48 --> 5028.08
inflicted with

5025.92 --> 5031.12
Ballard but that doesn't mean they have

5028.08 --> 5035.0
to then be disgusting demon

5031.12 --> 5038.239
people they can avoid that side they can

5035.0 --> 5040.159
realize that about their behavior

5038.239 --> 5043.159
instead of always surrendering to their

5040.159 --> 5043.159
ideological

5045.8 --> 5053.08
Drive B you B of

5049.08 --> 5053.08
course of course it was

5059.76 --> 5067.52
her that's so typical

5064.28 --> 5067.5199999999995
and she keeps doing it

5068.04 --> 5076.96
too I mean she's she's kind of like

5072.48 --> 5080.04
a like a chat Nazi she really is I don't

5076.96 --> 5082.44
get why she does that too like why I

5080.04 --> 5085.119
mean if somebody's going to be like [ __ ]

5082.44 --> 5087.32
the Bible then I get it right you're

5085.119 --> 5090.119
there you're yeah you kick him out I get

5087.32 --> 5094.239
it but duper is

5090.119 --> 5097.759999999999
just it's just duper you don't ban

5094.239 --> 5100.638999999999
duper it's ridiculous you don't ban

5097.76 --> 5100.639
people because they're

5102.199 --> 5107.32
stupid you ban them because they're

5105.0 --> 5110.76
malignant but you got to be able to

5107.32 --> 5115.48
actually size that up if you

5110.76 --> 5117.4800000000005
can't because you keep just seeing bad

5115.48 --> 5121.0
intention in people that

5117.48 --> 5122.799999999999
don't then you shouldn't ban people

5121.0 --> 5126.36
because you blatant

5122.8 --> 5128.76
are not capable enough to judge whether

5126.36 --> 5131.719
they are actually malignant and end up

5128.76 --> 5134.280000000001
Banning the wrong people

5131.719 --> 5137.639
Paula Bible

5134.28 --> 5137.639
you stop

5138.56 --> 5144.76
it stop being a chat Nazi stop Banning

5143.119 --> 5149.759999999999
people that don't deserve

5144.76 --> 5154.280000000001
it I mean it I'm I'm I'm angry about

5149.76 --> 5154.280000000001
it like what are you doing

5156.0 --> 5164.04
why are you getting in Nathan's

5159.4 --> 5167.119
chat and why are you just Banning people

5164.04 --> 5169.199
there when they are obviously people

5167.119 --> 5172.96
that just want to

5169.199 --> 5174.919999999999
chat clumsy or

5172.96 --> 5178.52
otherwise

5174.92 --> 5180.4
right I mean I am going to say something

5178.52 --> 5182.719
it needs to

5180.4 --> 5186.04
stop that behavior needs to stop I

5182.719 --> 5190.2390000000005
already got trouble enough

5186.04 --> 5193.119
with good people like Michael Khan

5190.239 --> 5195.5599999999995
getting in a bad mood and like I'm going

5193.119 --> 5196.92
to kick anybody that resists right he

5195.56 --> 5199.2390000000005
gets in these moods sometimes and

5196.92 --> 5203.28
there's others too and I'm like I get it

5199.239 --> 5209.08
it's really disruptive though but I mean

5203.28 --> 5209.08
he gets it he gets out of it but Paul

5209.159 --> 5214.879999999999
just she always does that and I don't

5213.159 --> 5217.0
think it's good I don't even know why

5214.88 --> 5219.76
she gets a wrench really Nathan I really

5217.0 --> 5219.76
don't understand

5221.239 --> 5228.44
it I mean does is she like really good

5224.92 --> 5230.1990000000005
at posting links all the time no it's

usually Divergent Droid that does it

5230.199 --> 5234.678999999999
right so why does she even have a wrench

5232.6 --> 5237.04
when she just

5234.679 --> 5241.119
keeps Banning

5237.04 --> 5244.119

5563.199 --> 5569.919999999999
off that was like by the way last

5567.719 --> 5573.44
night at the beginning of the night at

5569.92 --> 5574.76
least like later like

5573.44 --> 5577.199
basically early in the morning it

5574.76 --> 5579.679
started to get all cloudy and shitty

5577.199 --> 5583.5199999999995
like this but it was like a really

5579.679 --> 5586.119
crackling clear sky at night was a lot

5583.52 --> 5589.360000000001
of blue sky and that like went way

5586.119 --> 5593.639
through the night and so there were like

5589.36 --> 5597.28
really really bright stars and moon

5593.639 --> 5600.04
out there was the Moon looked like it

5597.28 --> 5602.96
was a slight sickle and it was so bright

5600.04 --> 5605.56
that you could like see the shadow

5602.96 --> 5608.96
effect again on the moon it's always so

5605.56 --> 5612.04
weird when that happens right you see

5608.96 --> 5614.88
the moon the sickle very it's very

5612.04 --> 5617.719
bright but you then also see like the

5614.88 --> 5617.719
dark part

5632.48 --> 5638.239
and then you really like see like the

5635.76 --> 5640.52
the the Circle continue in the dark it's

5638.239 --> 5640.5199999999995
so

5642.119 --> 5648.48
weird it always happens like in those

5645.6 --> 5650.76
phes not before that it's only when it's

5648.48 --> 5654.4
like a sickle then you like really see

5650.76 --> 5658.4800000000005
the Circle continue in the dark it's so

5654.4 --> 5663.48
weird it's like the whole thing just get

5658.48 --> 5663.48
specular what do you call that

5664.119 --> 5668.0
specular it's like it's there's this

5666.52 --> 5670.96
Halo

5668.0 --> 5672.96
suddenly coming like behind a circle

5670.96 --> 5675.08
behind it almost right that's kind of

5672.96 --> 5676.719
what it looks like not saying that's

5675.08 --> 5678.159
literally what that is it's just I'm

5676.719 --> 5680.52
trying to describe what it looks like

5678.159 --> 5682.759999999999

5680.52 --> 5686.84
object that you're seeing you're seeing

5682.76 --> 5686.84
a light effect all of it

convoluted since the Google blocking

6060.32 --> 6065.92
system oh yeah you can block people but

6062.88 --> 6067.76
you can't unblock them in your YouTube

6067.76 --> 6072.88
Google account which most people never

6070.04 --> 6074.88
even heard of at this point you only

6072.88 --> 6078.639
know about that if you've been here like

6074.88 --> 6078.639
10 years when that thing was still

6079.84 --> 6082.84

6358.28 --> 6363.239
really help me out in like tight

6361.48 --> 6367.879999999999
spots

6363.239 --> 6370.598999999999
so I totally everybody's tight out there

6367.88 --> 6374.76
I don't expect you to basically

6370.599 --> 6376.4400000000005
like take money that like from your own

6374.76 --> 6378.84
freaking food budget to give you to me

6376.44 --> 6381.638999999999
or anything okay don't expect that

6378.84 --> 6384.04
unless you giving yourself like a I

6381.639 --> 6388.2390000000005
don't know a diet challenge or something

6384.04 --> 6390.84
then by all means yeah please do that

6388.239 --> 6393.04
but I know everybody's tied out there

6390.84 --> 6397.159000000001
the economy out there sucks jobs are

6393.04 --> 6397.159
tougher to get more

6397.88 --> 6403.8
traps so I'm

6400.88 --> 6406.84
just you'll make me happy if you all

6403.8 --> 6407.88
just stay afat and not have your lives

6406.84 --> 6411.400000000001
get

6407.88 --> 6414.28
Shattered by the overall economic crisis

6411.4 --> 6417.239
that's happening out

6414.28 --> 6419.8
there that's really my Prime concern is

6417.239 --> 6422.638999999999
that your lives don't all just explode

6419.8 --> 6425.719
okay and then if you manage to prevent

6422.639 --> 6427.92
that from happening then I love your

6425.719 --> 6430.04
support but if you're going to support

6427.92 --> 6432.52
me like here take my last money I'm

6430.04 --> 6435.32
going to die now then I refuse to take

6432.52 --> 6436.8
that unless you're a troll scumbag and

6435.32 --> 6439.119
you're just

6436.8 --> 6441.2390000000005
insane then by all means give me all

6439.119 --> 6444.96
your last cash and get the [ __ ] out of

6441.239 --> 6447.759999999999
this world but for my followers here

6444.96 --> 6451.52
that that I actually do care about yeah

6447.76 --> 6456.1990000000005
don't worry don't feel guilty I

6451.52 --> 6458.400000000001
mean when I'm desperate I might secretly

6456.199 --> 6461.759999999999
have the grabler within me kind of give

6458.4 --> 6463.92
you a feel of guilt right I I'm sorry

6461.76 --> 6466.76
it's just desperation man when you're

6463.92 --> 6471.32
feir when you're afraid of hunger

6466.76 --> 6473.84
it it makes you go and twist in ways

6471.32 --> 6478.04
that people normally wouldn't

6473.84 --> 6478.04
do fear of hunger is pretty

6478.599 --> 6484.8
scary right but

6481.96 --> 6486.88
uh I'm just really happy that your guys

6484.8 --> 6487.599
are still willing to support me whenever

6486.88 --> 6491.36

6487.599 --> 6494.159000000001
can and that as long as I just somehow

6491.36 --> 6497.239
get by in the really tight

6494.159 --> 6499.32
moments like that sometimes suddenly

6497.239 --> 6500.879999999999
Anonymous donors just jump in and people

6499.32 --> 6503.88
I've never even heard of and they're

6500.88 --> 6507.2390000000005

6559.159 --> 6564.96
in me anymore I just like I'm a

6561.96 --> 6567.8
desperate dick who didn't figure out how

6564.96 --> 6570.2390000000005
to properly survive financially in this

6567.8 --> 6572.2390000000005
world and I'm just like yeah Please

6570.239 --> 6574.0
Don't Let Me Drown and I could drown any

6572.239 --> 6575.44
moment and there's nothing else I can

6574.0 --> 6579.32
even figure out

6575.44 --> 6583.5599999999995
and how to crawl out of that scenario in

6579.32 --> 6585.799999999999
general except for just do this like be

6583.56 --> 6588.320000000001
a figure on YouTube

6585.8 --> 6591.0
be somebody that's like talking about

6588.32 --> 6593.5599999999995
morality since morality is such a big

6591.0 --> 6596.04
issue now in this worldwide

6593.56 --> 6599.080000000001
psychological World

6596.04 --> 6601.08
War right moral it's all about morality

6599.08 --> 6603.8
can you maintain morality even when you

6601.08 --> 6605.4
got nothing can you maintain morality

6603.8 --> 6606.76
when everything seems like it's going to

6605.4 --> 6609.598999999999
hell and there's nothing you can do

6606.76 --> 6612.4400000000005
about it can you maintain

6609.599 --> 6615.719
morality can you not break yourself can

6612.44 --> 6619.04
you keep going it's such an important

6615.719 --> 6622.04
theme and so I'm kind of living

6619.04 --> 6622.04
that

6623.56 --> 6631.52
and in ways also here to to tell you

6627.52 --> 6635.080000000001
like yeah guys no it's actually

6631.52 --> 6637.1990000000005
real it there really is a psychological

6635.08 --> 6638.96
warfare and people might downplay it in

6637.199 --> 6642.638999999999
their own minds because they just can't

6638.96 --> 6645.28
face it how bad it is it's better to

6642.639 --> 6650.32
deny it than to be burdened with the

6645.28 --> 6653.239
conscious of living through it and not

6650.32 --> 6657.119
directly being able to stop

6653.239 --> 6662.0
it once you find out only real thing you

6657.119 --> 6667.4
can do is plan how to endure and survive

6662.0 --> 6667.4
it and then maybe you'll Thrive

6668.32 --> 6673.119
maybe but most people don't even want to

6670.88 --> 6674.92
know about it they don't want to believe

6673.119 --> 6677.04
that that's actually happening they just

6674.92 --> 6680.2390000000005
want to go with the flow and if that

6677.04 --> 6683.4
flow sends them crashing smacking into a

6680.239 --> 6686.28
Rock splattering them all over it then

6683.4 --> 6689.239
so be it yeah ignorance is bliss and

6686.28 --> 6693.32
then you die and some people really do

6689.239 --> 6694.678999999999
live by that because they just can't

6693.32 --> 6697.92
they can't handle

6694.679 --> 6699.599
it they want handle it they might be

6697.92 --> 6703.1990000000005
able to handle it but they want they

6699.599 --> 6707.079
refuse to they choose to be

6703.199 --> 6709.638999999999
ignorant subconsciously after knowing

6707.079 --> 6713.28
that that's going to make them end up in

6709.639 --> 6716.56
a very dangerous spot and they'll have

6713.28 --> 6719.759999999999
no knowledge on how to recognize the

6716.56 --> 6722.4800000000005
danger and they feel that a lot of them

6719.76 --> 6726.0
they still do it because they just they

6722.48 --> 6728.36
refuse they refuse to face the reality

6726.0 --> 6732.119
of the psychological warfare that our

6728.36 --> 6735.799999999999
world is being subjected to top

6732.119 --> 6738.88
down it's a

6735.8 --> 6742.52
Siege Siege by Mega corporations and

6738.88 --> 6746.96
governments is Siege on resources but

6742.52 --> 6749.679
also a Siege on morality and our

6746.96 --> 6752.36
psychology they're besieging us with

6749.679 --> 6755.76
guilt they're convinc trying to convince

6752.36 --> 6759.799999999999
us that we don't even have the right to

6755.76 --> 6759.8
exist they're trying to do

6760.599 --> 6766.159000000001
that and you must recognize that Embrace

6763.36 --> 6771.839999999999
against it and it's very painful to do

6766.159 --> 6771.839999999999
that to recognize how bad it is

6772.079 --> 6778.32
but if you don't recognize it and you

6774.28 --> 6780.32
just let your get S get pulled through

6778.32 --> 6783.679
it all

6780.32 --> 6785.599
ignorant and Blissful then you do

6783.679 --> 6788.1990000000005
eventually end up in a position where

6785.599 --> 6790.400000000001
you're going to be responsible for

6788.199 --> 6793.0
people's deaths

6790.4 --> 6795.799999999999
indirectly when they obviously don't

6793.0 --> 6798.4
deserve it and when they did have good

6795.8 --> 6798.400000000001
things to

6798.76 --> 6801.76
offer

6802.199 --> 6808.799999999999
right if it's not just

6804.76 --> 6811.2390000000005
you you have to brace against this

6808.8 --> 6816.4400000000005
psychological warfare

6811.239 --> 6820.119
Siege or you too will end up dead or

6816.44 --> 6824.0
feeling endlessly guilty for people

6820.119 --> 6827.5199999999995
dying because you let it happen when

6824.0 --> 6828.76
they noticeably to you had things to

6827.52 --> 6830.639
offer

6828.76 --> 6832.88
Humanity

6830.639 --> 6836.079
you want to experience that then by all

6832.88 --> 6838.56
means keep up the ignorance ignorance is

6836.079 --> 6841.119
bliss and then you die and all the

6838.56 --> 6844.92
things you care about die and all good

6841.119 --> 6848.598999999999
things die in people and it all turns to

6844.92 --> 6848.599
Hell keep ignoring

6850.639 --> 6854.28
it yeah

6854.84 --> 6861.679
anyway man it's almost totally dark out

6858.679 --> 6861.679
there

6871.079 --> 6877.84
he's not a needy baller he's a regular

6873.28 --> 6880.719
troll no trit you're just [ __ ]

6877.84 --> 6884.1990000000005
wrong you're wrong and

6880.719 --> 6884.199
intolerant and it's

6886.8 --> 6891.92
pointless previous messages about Dr

6889.159 --> 6891.92
Shiva which

6892.679 --> 6897.52
one oh

6894.56 --> 6899.04
right saying our immune systems it's

6897.52 --> 6902.280000000001
like a rubber

6899.04 --> 6904.84
band I did not catch that

6902.28 --> 6907.04
terret I did not watch Shiva yesterday I

6904.84 --> 6910.119000000001
did notice he was

6907.04 --> 6914.0
there I'm worthy our wi don't worry oh

6910.119 --> 6914.0
thank you I do my

6918.599 --> 6921.599
best

6926.32 --> 6931.32
yeah that's right dupons and I know you

6928.44 --> 6933.44
do I know you actually mean it I can see

6931.32 --> 6937.119
it by how you write

6933.44 --> 6939.44
it and other people they just refuse to

6937.119 --> 6942.799999999999
believe that well a person can just

6939.44 --> 6945.638999999999
naturally be thick in that way it's not

6942.8 --> 6948.4800000000005
your fault and it really is it it's like

6945.639 --> 6950.76
youthful stupidity duper I don't know

6948.48 --> 6952.04
how old you are but there does seem to

6950.76 --> 6956.1990000000005
be like this

6952.04 --> 6958.4
weird naive youthful stupidity about you

6956.199 --> 6961.799999999999
which is perfectly okay dude when I was

6958.4 --> 6964.28
in my 20s I was like a freaking young

6961.8 --> 6967.360000000001
teenager in my mind in

6964.28 --> 6970.8
ways almost still am it's

6967.36 --> 6975.119
weird I get how stupidity actually how

6970.8 --> 6977.52
naivity despite Talent can Prevail and

6975.119 --> 6980.598999999999
dominate I know how that

6977.52 --> 6982.320000000001
works late 20 early yeah that would be

6980.599 --> 6984.2390000000005
my guess too clutch but he might just be

6982.32 --> 6986.92
older I don't

6984.239 --> 6990.879999999999
know I just know that D Rons by

6986.92 --> 6993.679
everything he's saying he's not there to

6990.88 --> 6996.76
get on your nerves I can see it by what

6993.679 --> 6999.4
he writes how he writes it like you guys

6996.76 --> 7003.04
think maybe oh how do you know well

6999.4 --> 7005.32
guess what I really read the messages in

7003.04 --> 7006.96
the chat especially when it's other

7005.32 --> 7009.84
people talking amongst themselves and

7006.96 --> 7013.159
not directly addressing me I pay

7009.84 --> 7015.96
attention to what people

7013.159 --> 7017.32
do especially when they become people

7015.96 --> 7019.679
that are like in

7017.32 --> 7022.759999999999
contention and when people are reacting

7019.679 --> 7027.679
to them I take notice of that

7022.76 --> 7029.4400000000005
interaction I keep a track record in my

7027.679 --> 7031.4400000000005
intuition it's not even my memory it's

7029.44 --> 7033.119
just I keep a track record in my mind

7031.44 --> 7035.759999999999
about how people work how Spirit

7033.119 --> 7038.96
mechanics work with

7035.76 --> 7039.92
individuals and duper Boons is just

7038.96 --> 7042.599
freaking

7039.92 --> 7046.159
sometimes but he's not malignant and

7042.599 --> 7048.599
he's not doing on purpose the troll

7046.159 --> 7049.719
thing of saying the wrong thing to get

7048.599 --> 7055.360000000001
on your

7049.719 --> 7055.36
nerves he's just a little shortsighted

7055.599 --> 7061.639
sometimes he doesn't do it on purpose to

7059.04 --> 7061.639
irritate

7062.599 --> 7068.32
people what I'm saying is dupons just

7065.36 --> 7070.799999999999
really could use a bit of more

7068.32 --> 7073.719
understanding from people in General

7070.8 --> 7076.52
doesn't mean indulge him it just means

7073.719 --> 7080.04
like be a little bit

7076.52 --> 7083.159000000001
patient I know it's the internet and all

7080.04 --> 7085.679
and it a troll could just appear be to

7083.159 --> 7088.799999999999
be there all of a sudden and all that

7085.679 --> 7090.04
but I mean just try be a little bit more

7088.8 --> 7093.04
patience with

7090.04 --> 7096.4
duper if he's annoying you just leave

7093.04 --> 7096.4
him there just let

7097.52 --> 7102.92
him don't Reveal Your age on the inter

7100.4 --> 7102.92
okay

7107.56 --> 7112.719
well

7109.44 --> 7112.719
okay that's

7117.36 --> 7124.48
weird but fine maybe you're 12 maybe

7122.119 --> 7128.32
dupons is literally 12 I mean he could

7124.48 --> 7131.879999999999
be here this is a 12 plus

7128.32 --> 7135.48
show I don't think he's 12 by the

7131.88 --> 7137.36
way but I mean he could be like a teen

7135.48 --> 7139.678999999999
that's really being super young is the

7137.36 --> 7141.96
only reason why I could imagine a

7139.679 --> 7145.599
non-female person on the internet would

7141.96 --> 7147.8
refuse to re reveal their age that's the

7145.599 --> 7149.56
only reason a non-female would ever

7147.8 --> 7151.84
refuse to reveal their age on the

7149.56 --> 7154.599
Internet seriously duper that can only

7151.84 --> 7158.2390000000005
mean that you're super

7154.599 --> 7161.2390000000005
young but whatever it doesn't really

7158.239 --> 7161.239
matter

7165.119 --> 7168.5599999999995
hey clutch good to see you by the

7180.119 --> 7184.36
way medical industry deception is more

7182.76 --> 7186.320000000001
harmful directly with the globe

7184.36 --> 7188.239
deception for birth makes people Ultra

7186.32 --> 7191.639
delusional about

7188.239 --> 7193.759999999999
reality yes good good comment there I

7191.639 --> 7196.679
missed it from three minutes ago from

7193.76 --> 7200.400000000001
expeditious truth but they both play

7196.679 --> 7203.119
into one another right medical industry

7200.4 --> 7204.879999999999
is super dangerous if you don't navigate

7203.119 --> 7207.48
carefully you could literally get

7204.88 --> 7209.96
yourself killed in the medical

7207.48 --> 7211.718999999999
industry as a

7209.96 --> 7216.0
patient

7211.719 --> 7218.199
but guess what being Ultra delusional

7216.0 --> 7219.8
because of globe belief guess what that

7218.199 --> 7223.919999999999
makes you do

7219.8 --> 7223.92
it makes you naively trust

7224.32 --> 7231.92
things and makes you more

7229.719 --> 7234.92
Reckless and maybe even more Reckless

7231.92 --> 7238.76
with yourself higher it will probably

7234.92 --> 7240.639
heighten the risks you will tend to take

7238.76 --> 7245.04
ball belief does

7240.639 --> 7249.88
that it really does that so yeah

7245.04 --> 7251.84
combined it aggravates the risk

7249.88 --> 7254.400000000001
yeah medical industry is dangerous but

7251.84 --> 7257.8
if everyone is a globe believer then the

7254.4 --> 7259.96
danger is Amplified it's

7257.8 --> 7261.92
exponential because if you're delusional

7259.96 --> 7265.599
you guess what that delusion will make

7261.92 --> 7268.04
you risk to go into procedures because

7265.599 --> 7271.52
your understanding is completely bunk

7268.04 --> 7274.159
about reality and about physiology even

7271.52 --> 7276.8
might be all allopathic minded atheistic

7274.159 --> 7279.28
and then you they make decisions that

7276.8 --> 7280.679
are really impactful that you don't

7279.28 --> 7282.599
understand the full consequences about

7280.679 --> 7284.92
that is completely unnecessary and then

7282.599 --> 7284.92
you

7284.96 --> 7288.44
die so it's the

7293.04 --> 7297.32
combination it's the combination that

7295.32 --> 7301.079
really does the

7297.32 --> 7304.5199999999995
damage right it's a a two component

7301.079 --> 7308.04
killer and that's a really favorite

7304.52 --> 7309.639
system for population

7308.04 --> 7310.88
control

7309.639 --> 7315.2390000000005
and

7310.88 --> 7318.079
poison in general yeah two

7315.239 --> 7321.5599999999995
components they love doing

7318.079 --> 7323.079
that like one is like yeah people could

7321.56 --> 7324.400000000001
argue it's bad it doesn't really do

7323.079 --> 7326.32
anything though it's just like oh it's a

7324.4 --> 7328.44
negative in then you introduce the other

7326.32 --> 7331.119
component and

7328.44 --> 7332.678999999999
then can't handle that but you could

7331.119 --> 7334.32
have the other component and not even

7332.679 --> 7336.719
notice it if you don't have the first

7334.32 --> 7340.84
component nothing happens I put them

7336.719 --> 7342.079
together and it's over very quickly well

7340.84 --> 7346.079
that's how you could

7342.079 --> 7348.639
see delusion from Globe religion the

7346.079 --> 7351.079
raising and the medical industry yeah

7348.639 --> 7355.92
you could survive either way but combine

7351.079 --> 7355.92
them and the risk becomes

7367.44 --> 7373.759999999999
substantial at 4 four or five teas and a

7371.079 --> 7376.719
pack of party Rings oh okay low fruit

7373.76 --> 7376.719
well glad you enjoyed

7378.52 --> 7386.320000000001
it you like to keep beer too hate to

7382.04 --> 7388.36
remove it yeah no hey what you like man

7386.32 --> 7392.599
it's your face it's it's the way you

7388.36 --> 7394.04
want to be seen so if you want a beard

7392.599 --> 7396.599
you think that would be good for you

7394.04 --> 7400.32
then dude keep the beard I wish I could

7396.599 --> 7402.400000000001
get a beard man I can't

7400.32 --> 7404.88
it'll just be like a a weird little

7402.4 --> 7408.36
patch and that's it like it I could get

7404.88 --> 7410.88
it like a a point or like a hairy horn

7408.36 --> 7412.759999999999
at on my chin and that's it that's the

7410.88 --> 7415.119
best I could probably do cuz I'm a

7412.76 --> 7416.04
freaking elf and I don't have hair on my

7415.119 --> 7419.799999999999
face

7416.04 --> 7421.559
so except for the mustache

7419.8 --> 7424.84
just

7421.559 --> 7427.4800000000005
like not the best mustache in the world

7424.84 --> 7429.400000000001
I I will admit it but hey I never even

7427.48 --> 7432.119
thought I could even get a mustache Dash

7429.4 --> 7434.598999999999
when I tried it first inspired by Owen

7432.119 --> 7434.598999999999
Benjamin

7434.679 --> 7439.52
too

7437.639 --> 7444.559
yeah

7439.52 --> 7447.079000000001
what you meant should Dr Shiva do oh his

7444.559 --> 7447.079000000001
beard

7447.92 --> 7455.28
thing what you're asking me about

7452.119 --> 7458.44
fashion of what Dr Shiva does are you

7455.28 --> 7461.5199999999995
serious I think Dr Shiva can very well

7458.44 --> 7464.678999999999
figure that out and I mean he's got a

7461.52 --> 7465.719
really good wife and all that that that

7464.679 --> 7467.88
knows

7465.719 --> 7470.2390000000005
fashion

7467.88 --> 7472.84
so I think he knows what he's doing and

7470.239 --> 7477.0
I mean like the new goatee type the the

7472.84 --> 7479.4800000000005
grayish goatee it's different but I mean

7477.0 --> 7481.4
like yeah it seems kind of I'm I'm

7479.48 --> 7484.119
curious It's still like growing and all

7481.4 --> 7487.759999999999
I'm curious where it goes but I mean he

7484.119 --> 7490.759999999999
kind of looks cool on

7487.76 --> 7490.76
him

7502.8 --> 7507.8
what what I I'm getting lost

7515.44 --> 7521.839999999999
here makes you look

7517.679 --> 7521.84
older who cares if it makes you look

7540.48 --> 7545.48
older look like that we're brenal

7543.199 --> 7548.239
candidate matter don't well yeah yeah I

7545.48 --> 7551.839999999999
think that like a goatee it would it

7548.239 --> 7551.839999999999
would strengthen him up a

7552.44 --> 7558.28
bit I mean it's logical that Shiva

7555.76 --> 7559.599
always didn't have that was like

7558.28 --> 7563.44
barefaced

7559.599 --> 7566.8
because well Dr Shiva is of course

7563.44 --> 7569.919999999999
logically holding on to his youth since

7566.8 --> 7573.52
he got ahead so far when he was young he

7569.92 --> 7575.719
freaking invented email as a kid so it's

7573.52 --> 7577.76
logical that he has very good memories

7575.719 --> 7580.44
of his own Youth and so he hangs on to

7577.76 --> 7583.96
his youth in way I try to do that

7580.44 --> 7585.919999999999
myself but it's making him you look like

7583.96 --> 7588.52
a bit

7585.92 --> 7591.119
young

7588.52 --> 7593.4400000000005
so yeah I mean the goatee thing that

7591.119 --> 7596.079
he's doing I mean it's probably going to

7593.44 --> 7596.079
help his

7607.599 --> 7613.119000000001
image

7610.52 --> 7615.360000000001
like guess as a slight modification to

7613.119 --> 7615.36
his

7619.52 --> 7625.2390000000005
appearance all right hey slow moon buggy

7622.84 --> 7625.2390000000005
good to see

7637.52 --> 7644.040000000001
you

7639.679 --> 7645.92
vid dis says you start 24 hours yeah

7644.04 --> 7648.159
YouTube says some weird things about

7645.92 --> 7649.719
videos and not just my videos it's all

7648.159 --> 7651.679
over the place people are just getting

7649.719 --> 7655.199
really weird readings like oh this video

7651.679 --> 7658.52
started 24 hours ago like

7655.199 --> 7661.0
what with any video for on YouTube

7658.52 --> 7663.52
YouTube's just being weird and buggy

7661.0 --> 7666.239
again they had an update and the update

7663.52 --> 7670.52
screwed everything

7666.239 --> 7670.5199999999995
up as usual

7671.079 --> 7676.4
oh slowmo yes I do I do actually have

7673.84 --> 7682.1990000000005
the very specific link for

7676.4 --> 7684.48
you let me get it

7682.199 --> 7687.558999999999
back where is

7684.48 --> 7691.4
it there you

7687.559 --> 7691.400000000001
go there we go

7697.44 --> 7701.0
slow-mo you're

7713.48 --> 7717.879999999999
welcome you remember that you revealed

7715.679 --> 7719.92
your age before could be yeah yeah I

7717.88 --> 7721.599
think I vaguely remember duper that you

7719.92 --> 7724.679
said that you were

7721.599 --> 7728.599
like in your 40s or something or

7724.679 --> 7730.04
50s it's just that the way you talk it

7728.599 --> 7732.1990000000005
just makes people think you're kind of

7730.04 --> 7735.159
dumb really young or

7732.199 --> 7736.879999999999
something that's just the way you are I

7735.159 --> 7739.719
have similar

7736.88 --> 7743.159000000001
issues I mean when I'm in my

7739.719 --> 7745.559
20s I had like this thing flare over me

7743.159 --> 7748.638999999999
like I was still a

7745.559 --> 7750.76
teenager it's just it just happens with

7748.639 --> 7752.719
people the people get stuck in a certain

7750.76 --> 7755.1990000000005
frequency and they associate the

7752.719 --> 7757.639
frequency with their entire being and it

7755.199 --> 7759.4
all crystallizes around that so that's

7757.639 --> 7762.04
just normal to

7759.4 --> 7767.28
you and other people might shame you for

7762.04 --> 7767.28
it I get it I I recognize it

7768.52 --> 7776.400000000001
duper too whatever man nobody cares

7771.28 --> 7776.4
about your age really you care about it

7786.92 --> 7791.32
perhaps yeah no yeah duper is no teret

7790.52 --> 7794.52
we

7791.32 --> 7797.639
know in my 20s

7794.52 --> 7800.320000000001
yep oh fair enough

7797.639 --> 7802.8
duper I sounded like a [ __ ] [ __ ]

7800.32 --> 7805.36
too when I was in my 20s so it's

7802.8 --> 7805.360000000001
perfectly

7805.88 --> 7812.679
fine in a way you should be glad that

7809.159 --> 7815.679
you're in your 20s throwing it out

7812.679 --> 7818.4
because people that

7815.679 --> 7820.96
don't they end up throwing out their

7818.4 --> 7823.44
retardation in their 40s and then they

7820.96 --> 7825.92
really make themselves look stupid and

7823.44 --> 7828.598999999999
then they usually can't handle that they

7825.92 --> 7830.52
actually turn out to be looking stupid

7828.599 --> 7833.28
so what you're doing is good it's better

7830.52 --> 7837.159000000001
to throw it out in your

7833.28 --> 7839.559
20s cuz in your 20s is a good time to be

7837.159 --> 7842.0
seen as stupid much better than when

7839.559 --> 7842.0
you're like

7842.079 --> 7848.719
40 so you just get it out your system

7844.88 --> 7852.0
you figure it out you learn and then you

7848.719 --> 7852.0
grow and you

7853.719 --> 7857.719
change we guessed it yeah yeah

7862.0 --> 7865.0
yeah

7877.159 --> 7880.159
fruit

7884.32 --> 7888.719
by the way duper did you ever actually

7886.639 --> 7891.96
get on with voice and all that did you

7888.719 --> 7895.159
ever like try

7891.96 --> 7895.159
fed uh

7895.48 --> 7900.0
Discord cuz I'm thinking like I'm being

7898.119 --> 7902.28
silly right now but I'm thinking like

7900.0 --> 7906.0
maybe I'd like to get you on the show

7902.28 --> 7909.04
one time just you and me over Skype or

7906.0 --> 7911.44
something if you dare to reveal your

7909.04 --> 7911.44
actual

7916.159 --> 7921.239
voice right because if you'd maybe be a

7919.32 --> 7924.199
real person out there and people could

7921.239 --> 7926.678999999999
actually hear your voice then they'd be

7924.199 --> 7928.4
inclined to not just see you like a

7926.679 --> 7930.4400000000005
potential troll that's getting on their

7928.4 --> 7935.558999999999
nerves but as an actual

7930.44 --> 7935.558999999999
person not confident in your voice yet

7936.88 --> 7941.4800000000005
a okay

7939.159 --> 7941.48
fair

7943.92 --> 7949.639
enough but I mean you don't have to be

7947.28 --> 7952.5199999999995
perfect English or anything right as

7949.639 --> 7954.96
long as you're just as people can just

7952.52 --> 7957.360000000001
make out what you're saying it's good

7954.96 --> 7959.559
enough You Don't Have To Be A Champion

7957.36 --> 7960.92
English speaker or anything don't worry

7959.559 --> 7963.8
about

7960.92 --> 7966.04
it hate my voice as well yeah clutch but

7963.8 --> 7970.04
your voice isn't terrible though your

7966.04 --> 7970.04
voice is pretty good

7972.04 --> 7978.119
I actually think that really your the

7975.639 --> 7981.639
voice your vocal cords and all that

7978.119 --> 7984.96
clutch your actual vocal cords the sound

7981.639 --> 7987.96
of your voice is better than mine I mean

7984.96 --> 7991.159
I have good voice control I can do a lot

7987.96 --> 7992.52
of things right but the actual sound of

7991.159 --> 7996.558999999999
my vocal

7992.52 --> 7999.639
cords it's not really great it's kind of

7996.559 --> 8002.2390000000005
squeaky and

7999.639 --> 8004.04
it gives me a huge range though that's

8002.239 --> 8006.159
the one advantage really is that I can

8004.04 --> 8009.239
go from very

8006.159 --> 8012.638999999999
low all the way over

8009.239 --> 8015.959999999999
there deflex it but I I have a wide

8012.639 --> 8020.400000000001
range from low to high but the actual

8015.96 --> 8023.079
sound quality of my voice is me I'm very

8020.4 --> 8027.0
glad what I've learned to do with it

8023.079 --> 8028.5199999999995
though I I've got a lot out of it but

8027.0 --> 8031.199
sometimes I wish I had a a more

8028.52 --> 8033.4800000000005
naturally brilliant

8031.199 --> 8035.96
voice which does not sound like that at

8033.48 --> 8035.959999999999
all by the

8036.719 --> 8042.679
way but it's not meant to be I got more

8039.88 --> 8042.679
of a squeaky

8043.079 --> 8046.84
voice could be worse

8047.0 --> 8051.92
though clutch voice is similar to Crow

8049.8 --> 8055.1990000000005
yeah it's more in that direction a more

8051.92 --> 8058.159
natural storytellers type of voice

8055.199 --> 8061.0
American Storyteller type of voice yeah

8058.159 --> 8063.48
it I agree just like that guy that came

8061.0 --> 8067.28
on Nathan Oakley the other day that

8063.48 --> 8067.28
really loved to hear himself

8067.88 --> 8073.8
talk but he had like an excellent like

8071.52 --> 8076.320000000001
classic storytelling

8073.8 --> 8078.400000000001
voice and I can't mimic that properly

8076.32 --> 8081.0
but he just had that voice that is just

8078.4 --> 8083.4
like keeps on rolling and rolling and

8081.0 --> 8086.28
you just can't get enough of it and he

8083.4 --> 8090.558999999999
couldn't get enough of his own

8086.28 --> 8094.0
voice right I don't have that type of

8090.559 --> 8096.679
voice I mean at least my voice is not as

8094.0 --> 8099.159
bad as flat soid who's like the Pinnacle

8096.679 --> 8101.4800000000005
of squeaky voice pretty much concerning

8099.159 --> 8101.48
that

8102.239 --> 8109.239
effect but sometimes I wish I had a good

8105.48 --> 8109.239
old classic American

8110.679 --> 8115.159
voice but I'm a little bit more

8116.8 --> 8119.8
squeaky

8123.96 --> 8127.639
and even if I were to talk I'd have

8125.92 --> 8130.28
nothing to talk

8127.639 --> 8133.679
about yeah

8130.28 --> 8135.159
right no I don't believe you duper of

8133.679 --> 8137.4800000000005
course you'd have something to talk

8135.159 --> 8140.5199999999995
about and besides I'll just start asking

8137.48 --> 8143.638999999999
you questions and then you'll probably

8140.52 --> 8146.0
start asking me questions to get away

8143.639 --> 8148.400000000001
from having to answer the questions that

8146.0 --> 8150.52
I asked you and then we can can keep on

8148.4 --> 8152.679
going and then you suddenly realize oh

8150.52 --> 8154.400000000001
yeah I can ask a lot of questions you do

8152.679 --> 8158.079
that in chat too and now you can just do

8154.4 --> 8160.119
it in the real with your voice we can

8158.079 --> 8161.719
get a better picture of who you are

8160.119 --> 8162.639
because that's why I would get you on

8161.719 --> 8165.36
the show

8162.639 --> 8167.96
duper it's because I want to create a

8165.36 --> 8169.4
better picture of who you are to the the

8167.96 --> 8172.28
rest of the

8169.4 --> 8174.879999999999
internet so they maybe stop seeing you

8172.28 --> 8177.88
as just a troll and want to kick you

8174.88 --> 8179.1990000000005
out cuz that keeps happening and I think

8177.88 --> 8181.1990000000005
it's a

8179.199 --> 8183.759999999999
shame

8181.199 --> 8186.04
anyway right you I hope you all enjoying
