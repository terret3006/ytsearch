75.92 --> 83.43900000000001
so the weather today is

80.4 --> 86.96000000000001
different it's

83.439 --> 90.0
quite chaotic because let's say

86.96 --> 92.88
an hour ago this was

90.0 --> 93.84
pretty clouded and it was actually

92.88 --> 98.39999999999999
snowing

93.84 --> 101.43900000000001
it's serious it was full-blown snow

98.4 --> 103.60000000000001
and now yeah safe to say

101.439 --> 104.96
nothing that touched down actually

103.6 --> 108.0
stayed

104.96 --> 109.67999999999999
so it immediately evaporated because

108.0 --> 112.88
it's still pretty sunny

109.68 --> 113.60000000000001
oh and there it goes behind the clouds

112.88 --> 118.96
again

113.6 --> 118.96
slowly the wind out there is really cold

120.479 --> 123.92
like it's really cold wind

124.88 --> 129.51999999999998
and there is quite a lot of wind you

127.119 --> 132.879
might be able to see

129.52 --> 135.59900000000002
the tree branches moving

132.879 --> 136.879
so yeah weird mixed weather there's

135.599 --> 139.67999999999998
clouds going about

136.879 --> 140.959
with snow coming out of them but in

139.68 --> 144.56
between there's also

140.959 --> 147.84
nice warm sun for as long as you're

144.56 --> 151.2
outside yeah out of the wind because

147.84 --> 154.31900000000002
the wind is really really cold

151.2 --> 170.0
so and yeah look at that clear

154.319 --> 172.23899999999998
blue patch up there deep deep clear blue

170.0 --> 172.239
right

173.519 --> 175.84
hello

177.519 --> 186.64000000000001

[Music]

207.2 --> 210.95899999999997
yeah this weekend the shows have been

208.72 --> 214.159
quite a blast it's unexpected

210.959 --> 227.68
two-hour shows both of them

214.159 --> 231.68
but they went really well

227.68 --> 235.12
oh [ __ ] damn it

231.68 --> 237.92000000000002
i forgot to make notes

235.12 --> 237.92000000000002
to catch up

238.159 --> 242.07999999999998
it's weird because in my head i i really

240.56 --> 254.959
thought that i had made notes but

242.08 --> 258.47900000000004
apparently i just forgot

254.959 --> 258.479
hello territt 306

265.36 --> 269.84000000000003

273.759 --> 280.84000000000003
is like easter monday

277.12 --> 283.199
so yeah over here a lot of stores are

280.84 --> 286.88

283.199 --> 289.04
uh not all of them

286.88 --> 291.44
but a lot of like side stores are now

289.04 --> 291.44
closed

291.52 --> 299.68
supermarkets still open

294.8 --> 299.68
all right let me try to catch up the

308.84 --> 311.84
notes

319.44 --> 328.479
okay as far as remember there was no

324.0 --> 328.479
was there no open benjamin yesterday

331.12 --> 334.479
a lot of good premieres nathan had like

333.44 --> 336.84
a lot of streams

334.479 --> 338.479
but they were yeah all of them were good

336.84 --> 341.28
uh

338.479 --> 344.15999999999997
thursday show friday show and he did the

341.28 --> 344.15999999999997
presentation

346.8 --> 355.28000000000003
uh yeah with brian so

350.96 --> 359.52
that yeah that one was just really good

355.28 --> 362.0
i watched it back and yeah it was great

359.52 --> 363.75899999999996
like that show that presentation brian

362.0 --> 365.199
gave it's definitely worth watching

363.759 --> 368.72
several times

365.199 --> 370.36
maybe not ex like in a row but like it's

368.72 --> 372.8
a good one he put down some

370.36 --> 377.6
meteorological details

372.8 --> 380.479
in a very clear-cut summarized way

377.6 --> 382.16
and it was really interesting also good

380.479 --> 387.68
graphs he got there

382.16 --> 387.68
he got in there from meteorology

392.84 --> 395.84
um

398.4 --> 403.19899999999996
all right oh yeah bible literalist also

400.88 --> 404.4
went live but i didn't really catch it i

403.199 --> 406.8
got stuck to the

404.4 --> 409.84
to nathan shows i pretty much only watch

406.8 --> 409.84000000000003
nathan shows

413.599 --> 425.28
and watch some netflix later on

422.96 --> 425.28
right

436.08 --> 441.919
hello hello dutch sailor

439.199 --> 441.91900000000004
good to see you

443.84 --> 448.71999999999997
um man

446.88 --> 450.24
yeah i've been watching some star trek

448.72 --> 455.36
discovery again and

450.24 --> 455.36
god it is such a mixed bag

460.96 --> 464.0
because i think that just like the whole

463.68 --> 467.68
the

464.0 --> 470.879
whole oh god trans culture

467.68 --> 472.319
they kind of integrated in there it's

470.879 --> 474.47900000000004
getting on my nerves

472.319 --> 476.47900000000004
it's like really starting to annoy me it

474.479 --> 478.8
already had an occasion

476.479 --> 480.24
in earlier in the series but just like

478.8 --> 484.96000000000004
they only piled it up

480.24 --> 488.879
and i guess they did it in a

484.96 --> 493.84
in an okay way it was just like

488.879 --> 493.84000000000003
i just don't care about that [ __ ] at all

494.96 --> 498.63899999999995
right so you really have like it just a

497.599 --> 500.0
gay bunch

498.639 --> 503.68
pretty much that's just what i'm going

500.0 --> 503.68
to call it in there

504.84 --> 510.56
and

507.599 --> 512.959
also the sci-fi at times is just like

510.56 --> 516.08
highly bordering fantasy i guess that

512.959 --> 517.3599999999999
in the old star trek days they did that

516.08 --> 519.44
as well

517.36 --> 522.64
with like new confrontations in the

519.44 --> 522.6400000000001
moment they got very

522.719 --> 529.839
um yeah

526.399 --> 531.44
like fairy tale like fantasy influences

529.839 --> 535.0400000000001
and they kind of do that with this

531.44 --> 537.6
series as well here and there

535.04 --> 539.5999999999999
it's i don't know man i just don't like

537.6 --> 542.5600000000001
this series as much

539.6 --> 545.76
i watched it before and it gave my

542.56 --> 545.76
review of it before

547.279 --> 553.279
but yeah the the problems remain

551.04 --> 554.56
and i don't know man it's just the whole

553.279 --> 563.8389999999999
thing just give me

554.56 --> 563.8389999999999
gives me this kitch kind of feeling

567.04 --> 570.56
it's it's hard to explain

574.48 --> 582.08
but because of it also yeah and just

578.64 --> 584.959
like it distracts

582.08 --> 587.12
from the sort of story that is set up

584.959 --> 591.8389999999999
which is already kind of complex so

587.12 --> 591.839
the whole thing is just very adhd

593.279 --> 596.64
and confusing

602.839 --> 619.839
what they used the bible in star trek

606.72 --> 619.839
did they in the old series huh

621.76 --> 624.88
which one that said if you're going to

623.44 --> 631.9200000000001
just say star trek

624.88 --> 633.92
you got to be a little bit more specific

631.92 --> 635.4399999999999
because there's so many series oh they

633.92 --> 638.8
used the bible somewhere

635.44 --> 640.5600000000001
wow surprise surprise

638.8 --> 641.8389999999999
there's a lot of series with a lot of

640.56 --> 644.7199999999999
episodes

641.839 --> 646.5600000000001
unless you're pointing at something more

644.72 --> 646.9590000000001
specific and then you basically gotta

646.56 --> 650.4799999999999
say

646.959 --> 652.01
this series which one

650.48 --> 655.08
otherwise it's just gonna

652.01 --> 655.08
[Music]

658.48 --> 664.16
i look up some titles

661.68 --> 664.16
okay

665.44 --> 669.9200000000001
right anyway yeah that's i was watching

668.48 --> 675.839
that

669.92 --> 675.8389999999999
before ending the night

681.44 --> 689.839
wrath of khan right that's a movie

697.44 --> 702.1600000000001
and exactly how do they use the bible in

700.839 --> 705.2
there

702.16 --> 708.64
like it's not literal right it's used

705.2 --> 708.6400000000001
more as an inspiration

712.88 --> 717.8389999999999
small bits and pieces okay

721.12 --> 726.88
oh wait do you mean the newer movie the

724.32 --> 726.88
remake

728.32 --> 731.36
hello dean wright

740.0 --> 744.0
right so when some character uses a

742.72 --> 746.88
bible as an inspiration

744.0 --> 746.88
that can also be

749.6 --> 753.839
a negative plan because from an atheist

752.88 --> 755.8389999999999
perspective

753.839 --> 757.2
religion including the bible is

755.839 --> 760.399
considered to be

757.2 --> 761.2
a dangerous sort of source of fanaticism

760.399 --> 764.24
right

761.2 --> 767.6
so when and villain uses the bible

764.24 --> 770.32
as inspiration it's actually oh

767.6 --> 771.6800000000001
look at the bad religion that's what

770.32 --> 773.839
they are doing right then

771.68 --> 773.8389999999999
right

775.17 --> 778.299
[Music]

779.6 --> 786.0790000000001
they made me believe that humans made

782.0 --> 788.88
themselves oh really

786.079 --> 788.88
a tricky one

789.279 --> 793.04
how did you come to believe that

794.639 --> 801.839
from star trek i mean come on

811.279 --> 816.959
right anyway it's just what was

814.56 --> 816.959
happening

817.839 --> 822.639
what i just happened to watch yesterday

823.12 --> 826.48
oh didn't make it too late plenty of

825.76 --> 829.199
sleep

826.48 --> 830.88
man my shoulder is doing a lot better

829.199 --> 834.16
like i'm noticing this

830.88 --> 836.399
it's still like it's almost now i'm more

834.16 --> 837.04
hyperactive because like some of the

836.399 --> 841.839
strain

837.04 --> 844.16
that just went straight there has gone

841.839 --> 845.6800000000001
so yeah it's it's definitely healing up

844.16 --> 848.48
and i'm like really like oh yeah i'm

845.68 --> 852.079
gonna get better oh man

848.48 --> 852.0790000000001
i feel the power coming

852.16 --> 858.959
i do it's like such a relief

855.68 --> 863.199
because that [ __ ] has been weighing on

858.959 --> 863.199
me quite literally for weeks now

864.639 --> 870.9590000000001
like where an average person would

867.279 --> 874.32
consider like basically being sick

870.959 --> 877.92
now because my life is not

874.32 --> 881.6
too packed and crowded

877.92 --> 883.36
and like work i have to do like a lot of

881.6 --> 885.519
it

883.36 --> 887.04
it's been not like it's been manageable

885.519 --> 889.6
for me so

887.04 --> 892.88
yeah but this sort of thing does happen

889.6 --> 892.88
like periodically it's

893.44 --> 901.36
it seems unavoidable

899.12 --> 903.279
but it's going away it's not gone yet so

901.36 --> 903.6800000000001
it's definitely not time like oh yeah

903.279 --> 906.72
that

903.68 --> 910.4799999999999
means i can just open up

906.72 --> 914.1600000000001
again and just no because then it would

910.48 --> 916.5600000000001
go straight back probably hey

914.16 --> 919.04
hello nathan oakley 1980 you're here now

916.56 --> 924.079
so we can start i think we started

919.04 --> 924.079
15 minutes ago but welcome to the chat

925.04 --> 929.279
you do not eat meat so that's a plus for

927.76 --> 934.079
your health

929.279 --> 934.079
i don't eat meat yes i do

938.48 --> 942.32
but i don't eat it every day though

951.519 --> 955.519
thought i was a vegetarian really what

953.6 --> 958.72
made you think that

955.519 --> 962.399
i mean i was a vegetarian like

958.72 --> 966.839
two years ago now for a year

962.399 --> 968.56
and that was good but like it was needed

966.839 --> 972.0790000000001
then and

968.56 --> 972.079
now not so much

973.68 --> 978.8
right but i'm not a carnivorian or

977.199 --> 983.8389999999999
anything i don't eat meat

978.8 --> 983.8389999999999
a lot

986.48 --> 990.16
like two out of three days i eat meat on

989.199 --> 992.3199999999999
average

990.16 --> 994.0
that's what it turns out into even like

992.32 --> 997.279
if i plan to just eat

994.0 --> 1000.639
meat for dinner three days in a row

997.279 --> 1004.16
then for some reason my body just

1000.639 --> 1007.199
makes me skip dinner it's weird

1004.16 --> 1007.199
it like that happens

1009.759 --> 1013.36
beautiful cold day here right nathan

1012.079 --> 1016.0
oakley yeah over here too

1013.36 --> 1017.6800000000001
like the wind is very icy snow came out

1016.0 --> 1020.16
of the clouds like not even an

1017.68 --> 1020.16
hour ago

1021.279 --> 1026.079
but yeah with the sun it's out right now

1024.319 --> 1028.3999999999999

1029.76 --> 1037.12
it is really nice and warm

1033.52 --> 1039.839

1041.439 --> 1044.64
but yeah some of these clouds out there

1043.36 --> 1046.559
there

1044.64 --> 1048.88
yeah snow is coming out of them pretty

1046.559 --> 1048.8799999999999
weird

1050.799 --> 1069.779

[Music]

1089.36 --> 1095.84
could be yeah

1098.32 --> 1102.3999999999999
right yeah and you're in the mountains

1099.84 --> 1108.559
then you're still

1102.4 --> 1111.039
and yeah you you got the coal there

1108.559 --> 1113.84
like during spring an autumn that

1111.039 --> 1113.84
matters a lot

1117.44 --> 1123.13
hello tony whitcomb good to see you in

1120.84 --> 1126.249
chat

1123.13 --> 1126.249
[Music]

1134.84 --> 1137.84
hmm

1142.0 --> 1146.0
right man yeah i'm still

1146.08 --> 1150.72
like i'm not in a void but i am still

1148.4 --> 1153.8400000000001
kind of dreamy because i had a lot of

1150.72 --> 1153.84
output yesterday

1154.24 --> 1159.84
with my hangout and i'm still kind of

1157.6 --> 1159.84
like

1162.84 --> 1169.76
stirring in the echo of it

1166.799 --> 1171.2
myself because a lot of thing came a lot

1169.76 --> 1175.12
of things came out me i had

1171.2 --> 1179.039
like a pretty a remarkable oversight

1175.12 --> 1182.1599999999999
even if i say so myself

1179.039 --> 1184.799
i could just it worked better doing all

1182.16 --> 1187.52
that thing doing the esoterics

1184.799 --> 1190.84
like i was really on form with that and

1187.52 --> 1193.84
i'm still like kind of like whoa

1190.84 --> 1193.84
dude

1206.159 --> 1209.3600000000001
just also in a way

1212.72 --> 1220.64
like standing up for my own form of

1216.159 --> 1223.8400000000001
christianity my own interpretation

1220.64 --> 1225.76
and then yeah being faced with

1223.84 --> 1226.9599999999998
i guess it's typical easter but just

1225.76 --> 1235.84
being faced with

1226.96 --> 1235.8400000000001
yeah the the institutes out there

1239.6 --> 1246.3999999999999
and now they've basically just

1243.2 --> 1250.24
yeah made

1246.4 --> 1254.3200000000002
the larger communities kind of deviate

1250.24 --> 1254.32
from the original bible

1255.6 --> 1261.039
it's just yeah because people can

1259.039 --> 1263.84
can chant things if they don't

1261.039 --> 1263.84
understand it

1263.919 --> 1267.679
then they're just going to be

1265.52 --> 1271.2
participating in kind of like

1267.679 --> 1273.039
tradition rituals and they don't

1271.2 --> 1275.919
really understand it they might have an

1273.039 --> 1278.1589999999999
idea handed down to them or that they

1275.919 --> 1280.3200000000002
came up with

1278.159 --> 1282.3200000000002
to kind of give it meaning or play a

1280.32 --> 1284.24
place but they don't really get what's

1282.32 --> 1288.08
going on and that seems to be

1284.24 --> 1293.28
a a theme

1288.08 --> 1293.28
within the vaster churchian communities

1293.919 --> 1305.8400000000001
and they hold on to these esoteric

1296.0 --> 1305.84
esoteric teachings

1310.96 --> 1318.48
the people of harp are going to do their

1313.28 --> 1321.84
thing oh really

1318.48 --> 1326.72
uh no dutch sailor no no

1321.84 --> 1326.72
you see it's april

1329.6 --> 1334.7199999999998
i mean how old are you serious

1332.64 --> 1336.5590000000002
not this is not like not trying to

1334.72 --> 1340.24
attack you here but

1336.559 --> 1342.72
this is the netherlands and it's april

1340.24 --> 1344.24
april we have a saying here i'm going to

1342.72 --> 1349.039
literally translate it

1344.24 --> 1352.24
in english oh it's snowing again wow

1349.039 --> 1355.12
just look at that it says april does

1352.24 --> 1356.88
what it wants well guess what april's

1355.12 --> 1360.32
doing exactly what it wants

1356.88 --> 1362.0
this [ __ ] like this the the weird

1360.32 --> 1365.2
mixture the sudden

1362.0 --> 1368.4
changes and all that back and forth

1365.2 --> 1373.3600000000001
that's normal that was going on

1368.4 --> 1376.4
like every year even in my pre-teens

1373.36 --> 1380.24
like that's normal that has

1376.4 --> 1380.24
nothing to do with harp at all

1381.2 --> 1385.919
and that like harp is just enormously

1386.84 --> 1390.32
overhyped

1388.64 --> 1392.3200000000002
like i'm pretty sure that if there's

1390.32 --> 1393.36
going to be some really big events

1392.32 --> 1396.3999999999999
somewhere some big

1393.36 --> 1398.9599999999998
weather event yeah harp might be used

1396.4 --> 1401.6000000000001
especially if you see like the weird

1398.96 --> 1402.0
elect yeah magnetic rainbow colors and

1401.6 --> 1405.4399999999998
all that

1402.0 --> 1408.96
[ __ ] totally out of place yeah okay

1405.44 --> 1410.0800000000002
haarp might be involved but haarp is not

1408.96 --> 1413.52
utilized

1410.08 --> 1416.6399999999999
in the normal weather regulation that's

1413.52 --> 1418.1589999999999
ridiculous only way

1416.64 --> 1420.0
they're actually doing anything like

1418.159 --> 1423.279
that

1420.0 --> 1425.44
might be i don't know subtle electrical

1423.279 --> 1430.0
influences to give it a slight nudge in

1425.44 --> 1432.3200000000002
which we're barely gonna not pick up

1430.0 --> 1434.0
not a dramatic influence and of course

1432.32 --> 1435.6
that well the trailing

1434.0 --> 1437.279
whatever that is whatever they leave

1435.6 --> 1438.6399999999999
behind that's going to have an influence

1437.279 --> 1440.0
the trails are going to have an

1438.64 --> 1442.96
influence

1440.0 --> 1444.559
but based on the system that is present

1442.96 --> 1448.159
at the time

1444.559 --> 1450.48
but harp the big harp station

1448.159 --> 1450.48
that's

1451.679 --> 1455.039
it's not made for that kind of

1453.919 --> 1457.039
widespread

1455.039 --> 1458.24
subtle influence it's more like a

1457.039 --> 1461.279
surgical tool

1458.24 --> 1463.1200000000001
within the entire weather system you

1461.279 --> 1466.32
know if harp's going to be used you

1463.12 --> 1467.36
you'll recognize it man the snow holy

1466.32 --> 1473.279
[ __ ]

1467.36 --> 1476.08
look this is what i mean it's just nuts

1473.279 --> 1476.08
can you see that

1482.72 --> 1487.84
i don't know if the camera's picking

1484.159 --> 1487.8400000000001
this up but there's like

1488.72 --> 1491.6000000000001
a lot of snow

1498.0 --> 1502.64
birds seem to be mostly just ignoring it

1503.36 --> 1507.4399999999998
that magpie is sitting there like uh

1505.52 --> 1509.76
yeah it's snowing

1507.44 --> 1509.76
okay

1512.84 --> 1515.84
whatever

1521.78 --> 1524.819
[Music]

1540.84 --> 1547.36
so

1542.48 --> 1547.3600000000001
it was kind of a joke oh goody thanks

1548.64 --> 1552.64
you know i take everything extremely

1551.039 --> 1556.1589999999999
literal as if it is a

1552.64 --> 1559.76
higher statement that sailor everybody

1556.159 --> 1559.7600000000002
in chat should know this by now

1560.08 --> 1565.4399999999998
superficial jokes i'm going to take them

1563.919 --> 1571.8400000000001
quite literal

1565.44 --> 1571.8400000000001
every single time it's what i do

1578.159 --> 1585.8400000000001
ah foul and buchanan that's good to know

1580.159 --> 1585.8400000000001
i didn't know that

1589.52 --> 1593.36
there's a lot of hot days in the last

1592.48 --> 1599.84
it's not

1593.36 --> 1599.84
those it's not here

1605.3 --> 1608.45
[Music]

1618.159 --> 1621.8400000000001
like seriously i recommend like all of

1621.52 --> 1625.12
you

1621.84 --> 1628.559
in my chat you've been hearing me right

1625.12 --> 1632.32
so we know there is

1628.559 --> 1635.12
some kind of thing happening

1632.32 --> 1637.039
like out of the pla like using the bible

1635.12 --> 1642.4799999999998
as a playbook

1637.039 --> 1642.48
using revelations as a playbook

1644.96 --> 1651.919
okay does that mean

1648.159 --> 1656.159
that like literally the final days

1651.919 --> 1658.48
are here i i will keep on bringing that

1656.159 --> 1658.48
back

1663.919 --> 1670.0
because like how could that happen

1667.52 --> 1672.24
how could that happen isn't it isn't it

1670.0 --> 1675.44
just technically more likely that

1672.24 --> 1677.36
through technology and i would use to

1675.44 --> 1679.6000000000001
say and science but

1677.36 --> 1680.8799999999999
yeah science become has become extremely

1679.6 --> 1685.76
convoluted

1680.88 --> 1688.0800000000002
that yeah the technological elite

1685.76 --> 1688.96
have basically it's more likely that

1688.08 --> 1691.84
they'll get just

1688.96 --> 1693.76
complete realm control complete realm

1691.84 --> 1695.4399999999998
control like they will literally have

1693.76 --> 1698.72
the levers for

1695.44 --> 1703.1200000000001
everything sun

1698.72 --> 1703.52
weather wind earthquake whatever they

1703.12 --> 1707.36
might

1703.52 --> 1707.36
gain control of it right

1709.679 --> 1715.52
so isn't it just more likely that

1711.6 --> 1715.52
they're just playing on us

1716.08 --> 1720.48
pushing playing on us like the last days

1719.039 --> 1722.96
to basically make

1720.48 --> 1724.0
people surrender to the end because they

1722.96 --> 1725.679
think it's time

1724.0 --> 1727.12
like okay there's nothing more we can do

1725.679 --> 1730.159
this is the end

1727.12 --> 1738.6399999999999
so according to the bible yeah let's

1730.159 --> 1740.72
move on to those final moments right

1738.64 --> 1743.3600000000001
so i think that in a way we're being

1740.72 --> 1743.3600000000001
gaslit

1743.52 --> 1750.48
by the technocrats being fooled into

1747.039 --> 1753.36
believing it not that it

1750.48 --> 1754.559
the bible and the revelations is not

1753.36 --> 1757.6789999999999
true

1754.559 --> 1760.08
it's a bit of a complex situation

1757.679 --> 1762.3990000000001
because it might have evolved into a

1760.08 --> 1765.6789999999999
self-fulfilling prophecy

1762.399 --> 1767.76
because of the technological control

1765.679 --> 1769.3600000000001
but then again it might have been

1767.76 --> 1771.6
foreseen

1769.36 --> 1773.279
you could say by god or through jesus

1771.6 --> 1774.9599999999998
even when there was no concept of

1773.279 --> 1778.0
technology

1774.96 --> 1781.919
the concept of power was very distinct

1778.0 --> 1785.039
so maybe it was predicted in order

1781.919 --> 1789.039
for it to happen

1785.039 --> 1792.32
and maybe it was even appeal like

1789.039 --> 1797.12
put down as absolutely

1792.32 --> 1800.72
the creator god causing these things

1797.12 --> 1802.9599999999998
to make it appealing to the egomaniacs

1800.72 --> 1805.039
that under the weight of their power

1802.96 --> 1807.679
completely lose

1805.039 --> 1808.48
their minds and are just becoming the

1807.679 --> 1813.3600000000001
devil

1808.48 --> 1816.3990000000001
so maybe it was even a trick to lure

1813.36 --> 1819.6
the devil that would come inevitably as

1816.399 --> 1822.8799999999999
as just technological power arises

1819.6 --> 1826.559
maybe it was even designed to trap them

1822.88 --> 1829.919
basically like a

1826.559 --> 1831.6
a big sword in a stone and eventually

1829.919 --> 1832.7990000000002
edema is going to come that could pull

1831.6 --> 1835.76
it out

1832.799 --> 1838.96
but the sword is there specifically to

1835.76 --> 1842.0
draw the demon towards the stone

1838.96 --> 1842.0
right that setup

1842.96 --> 1846.88
so i'm just taking it all pretty pretty

1845.76 --> 1849.2
easy

1846.88 --> 1850.0800000000002
and just saying no this is a fake out in

1849.2 --> 1853.44
a way like the

1850.08 --> 1856.559
end of days in a literal literally the

1853.44 --> 1859.8400000000001
end of the entire physical realm

1856.559 --> 1863.36
right that that's gas lighting

1859.84 --> 1866.9599999999998
we're being gas lit it pushed

1863.36 --> 1869.84
railroaded into that

1866.96 --> 1869.8400000000001
before its time

1871.039 --> 1874.32
on a very complex deep level that most

1873.679 --> 1877.3600000000001
people

1874.32 --> 1878.0
can't even touch upon because they're so

1877.36 --> 1882.8799999999999
stuck

1878.0 --> 1882.88
in the mud in their earthly distractions

1884.799 --> 1888.559
right now if you're going to be played

1886.559 --> 1892.32
on on a higher

1888.559 --> 1895.279
spiritual design level by dark people

1892.32 --> 1896.8799999999999
yeah it's going to be the end of days to

1895.279 --> 1898.88
you

1896.88 --> 1900.7990000000002
and you don't have the faculties to even

1898.88 --> 1904.72
figure out that you might

1900.799 --> 1904.72
be in the middle of a giant

1904.84 --> 1911.039
worldwide gaslighting operation

1907.519 --> 1914.08
right how would you know

1911.039 --> 1916.799
it's all too way too much so you're

1914.08 --> 1916.799
being played

1919.039 --> 1924.399
what the hell nathan oakley

1922.159 --> 1925.279
my bible has a misprint the holy

1924.399 --> 1935.6
sprocket

1925.279 --> 1938.32
what the [ __ ]

1935.6 --> 1939.6789999999999
right so it's complex like what is it

1938.32 --> 1942.96
what are the end days

1939.679 --> 1947.679
what is that is it there

1942.96 --> 1949.919
as a trap for the elite that they would

1947.679 --> 1951.3600000000001
just they couldn't help themselves but

1949.919 --> 1954.72
use it

1951.36 --> 1956.6399999999999
because of the influence that scenario

1954.72 --> 1959.679
would have

1956.64 --> 1962.72
so they just followed it was it

1959.679 --> 1965.679
specifically placed there

1962.72 --> 1965.679
to do just that

1970.08 --> 1976.0
to make the devil step in and gaslight

1973.84 --> 1980.6399999999999
the people into believing that that is

1976.0 --> 1984.24
the real thing to gain control

1980.64 --> 1984.24
to basically demoralize

1988.84 --> 1991.84
right

1992.55 --> 1995.6699999999998
[Music]

1996.24 --> 2000.72
what are we talking what are you talking

1997.84 --> 2000.72
about nathan what

2001.679 --> 2006.0
oh right to birthday yeah i heard it

2003.84 --> 2008.559
september 11th

2006.0 --> 2019.679
might be the actual birthday of jesus

2008.559 --> 2022.1589999999999
christ that's right

2019.679 --> 2023.679
all right so what i'm trying to say with

2022.159 --> 2027.2
all this

2023.679 --> 2027.2
in this little speech about

2027.36 --> 2035.6789999999999
the yeah the end times being

2031.519 --> 2038.24
basically a a puzzle

2035.679 --> 2041.44
and a weapon handed down by god through

2038.24 --> 2045.2
the bible in order to trap

2041.44 --> 2046.24
the devil in amidst the rising power

2045.2 --> 2051.52
level

2046.24 --> 2051.52
as a pre-design right i'm saying this

2052.0 --> 2058.72
because just notice a lot of people

2055.44 --> 2061.599
get stuck in just surrendering

2058.72 --> 2063.6789999999996
just you don't even realize it when you

2061.599 --> 2066.159
do it i think sometimes

2063.679 --> 2067.599
it's like a lot of you people do it

2066.159 --> 2071.359
surrender they just think

2067.599 --> 2071.839
it's is this is that as in just declared

2071.359 --> 2075.359
this

2071.839 --> 2077.04
is the last few days and it's all going

2075.359 --> 2078.639
to be destroyed like they're just

2077.04 --> 2080.56
declaring it

2078.639 --> 2082.639
right do you even know you're just

2080.56 --> 2087.119
declaring that

2082.639 --> 2087.119
you're basically just calling out doom

2087.52 --> 2094.24
by thinking about it like that

2091.119 --> 2097.92
do you understand that

2094.24 --> 2101.04
shouldn't do that right yeah you can

2097.92 --> 2105.2000000000003
absolutely point at the correlation

2101.04 --> 2108.56
don't get gas lit right

2105.2 --> 2111.5989999999997
the controllers the technological elite

2108.56 --> 2114.7999999999997
they're basically doing a

2111.599 --> 2114.8
baller thing

2115.28 --> 2120.7200000000003
right gaslighting you scatter ganning

2118.48 --> 2122.079
you with nonsense it takes too much time

2120.72 --> 2125.1189999999997
to deal with it

2122.079 --> 2130.2400000000002
it's basically what they're doing

2125.119 --> 2133.52
on a on a universal scale

2130.24 --> 2134.16
don't give in don't surrender don't

2133.52 --> 2137.28
declare

2134.16 --> 2145.839
doom don't just make it what they want

2137.28 --> 2145.8390000000004
you to think it is

2149.2 --> 2154.64
subscribe to bible literally sure

2152.4 --> 2156.0
i don't exactly know her stance on this

2154.64 --> 2159.1189999999997
look bible literally

2156.0 --> 2162.48
i she's and

2159.119 --> 2164.88
she's in a lot of ways an accident but

2162.48 --> 2167.04
yeah i think that in the end that she

2164.88 --> 2170.2400000000002
does realize like the difference and in

2167.04 --> 2173.68
her spirit she remains very sharp she

2170.24 --> 2177.1189999999997
knows like in the moment in the moment

2173.68 --> 2177.1189999999997
that's how you truly see

2179.44 --> 2184.0
so i don't know exactly her stance about

2181.76 --> 2186.88
this

2184.0 --> 2189.119
it's just that i've been figuring this

2186.88 --> 2189.119
out

2190.16 --> 2194.0789999999997
for a while now being confronted with

2192.4 --> 2196.4
people and their opinions and their

2194.079 --> 2198.4
responses to everything's going on from

2196.4 --> 2201.839
a lot of angles

2198.4 --> 2201.839
all kinds of groups

2202.32 --> 2205.599
and it's just more and more this is my

2203.92 --> 2210.2400000000002
conclusion like this

2205.599 --> 2210.2400000000002
is a fake out and it's a big one

2211.119 --> 2217.04
like powers are being revealed but

2214.0 --> 2220.079
they're also being used to just suggest

2217.04 --> 2223.92
right like they're trying

2220.079 --> 2223.92
to emulate the devil

2225.44 --> 2231.8
to basically

2228.72 --> 2234.64
bluff full control like

2231.8 --> 2235.76
invincibility that like that's the bluff

2234.64 --> 2239.5989999999997
you get it

2235.76 --> 2243.8390000000004
but it's an emulation it's a mirage it's

2239.599 --> 2243.839
it's the wizard of oz

2252.16 --> 2257.44
and even in just zooming in on specific

2256.4 --> 2259.6800000000003
situations

2257.44 --> 2261.52
out there in the world and governments

2259.68 --> 2264.64
and corporations what they do

2261.52 --> 2267.7599999999998
the propaganda that's already

2264.64 --> 2269.68
clear cut out there it's fractalized all

2267.76 --> 2270.4
over the place the wizard of oz

2269.68 --> 2274.64
mechanism

2270.4 --> 2274.64
it's everywhere in everything

2275.04 --> 2279.2
so when you see that you should

2278.079 --> 2282.2400000000002
basically try to

2279.2 --> 2286.3199999999997
zoom out and realize

2282.24 --> 2288.9599999999996
maybe the whole thing is just that

2286.32 --> 2289.52
including the suggestion of the devil

2288.96 --> 2292.56
having

2289.52 --> 2294.56
arrived and doing all this [ __ ] louding

2292.56 --> 2297.599
in the end times

2294.56 --> 2300.16
right is that so unreasonable for me to

2297.599 --> 2300.1600000000003
think that

2304.32 --> 2308.96
or or did you like did you like the

2307.52 --> 2311.2
sensation of

2308.96 --> 2313.68
it's all about to end it's all about to

2311.2 --> 2316.16
blow up

2313.68 --> 2317.52
did you like it a little too much you

2316.16 --> 2321.5989999999997
don't want to go back to

2317.52 --> 2324.839
just the nuisance of

2321.599 --> 2326.2400000000002
the normal ways of perceiving things out

2324.839 --> 2329.2
there

2326.24 --> 2331.5989999999997
you don't want to go back you want to

2329.2 --> 2334.96
believe it's all doomed

2331.599 --> 2336.0
well then they got you they got you

2334.96 --> 2341.839
trapped in the dream

2336.0 --> 2341.839
they got you trapped in the end days

2342.48 --> 2347.359
where you lose oversight that's what it

2344.64 --> 2349.92
does makes you lose oversight

2347.359 --> 2352.3199999999997
you retract you narrow down because it

2349.92 --> 2355.599
might end any moment

2352.32 --> 2357.599
and you lose the subtle oversight

2355.599 --> 2369.839
it's what they want that's how they keep

2357.599 --> 2369.839
you in the dark

2370.88 --> 2376.56
wow that was real but the moon isn't i

2373.2 --> 2383.839
never said the moon isn't real

2376.56 --> 2383.839
you see it don't you that's real

2392.56 --> 2397.839
i still got a bun here i'm gonna chew on

2395.2 --> 2397.839
that

2436.839 --> 2439.839
so

2443.839 --> 2448.24
though that's very nice that you would

2445.76 --> 2448.2400000000002
like that

2449.2 --> 2453.839
i don't think that any of that is super

2451.28 --> 2453.8390000000004
unlikely

2454.8 --> 2457.6800000000003
it's just that

2457.92 --> 2460.7200000000003
why does it matter

2465.04 --> 2469.68
like ever consider that

2469.92 --> 2476.48
do we need jesus to come back

2473.52 --> 2478.64
to basically set things straight are we

2476.48 --> 2481.839
that

2478.64 --> 2485.359
in that lost to the final level

2481.839 --> 2487.52
are we so lost that we're giving him no

2485.359 --> 2491.2799999999997
choice but to return

2487.52 --> 2494.319
is it really that bad or is that just

2491.28 --> 2497.52
you sliding down

2494.319 --> 2497.52
into the pit

2498.079 --> 2502.8
surrendering to weakness because every

2500.88 --> 2503.6800000000003
time you want jesus to return that's

2502.8 --> 2509.8390000000004
basically

2503.68 --> 2509.839
admission that we are defeated

2511.44 --> 2516.64
that humanity here in this realm

2514.72 --> 2523.839
through the generations that we couldn't

2516.64 --> 2523.839
do it

2530.4 --> 2537.76
that through us

2533.52 --> 2540.24
god could not set things straight

2537.76 --> 2551.8390000000004
said what you believe you believe we

2540.24 --> 2551.839
can't do it

2555.28 --> 2562.0
if you believe that then the technocrats

2558.64 --> 2566.56
have one they absolutely

2562.0 --> 2566.56
have one if that is what you believe

2568.4 --> 2572.64
gas lit you into a position of complete

2571.04 --> 2579.839
surrender

2572.64 --> 2579.839
and that's what they want

2590.48 --> 2595.68
i feel to understand new age what are

2592.8 --> 2595.6800000000003
you talking about

2599.68 --> 2602.7999999999997
inner christ of consciousness awakening

2602.16 --> 2606.0
shall happen

2602.8 --> 2608.4
it is happening hello

2606.0 --> 2608.4
hello

2609.119 --> 2616.1600000000003
lots of people they're feeling it

2613.119 --> 2616.6400000000003
they're trying to grasp it little by

2616.16 --> 2619.52
little

2616.64 --> 2621.2799999999997
i focused a lot of my life on being able

2619.52 --> 2623.52
to grasp it

2621.28 --> 2624.48
it's the the higher insight higher

2623.52 --> 2627.839
insight

2624.48 --> 2630.48
without the corruption right

2627.839 --> 2631.839
christ awakening yeah what are you

2630.48 --> 2634.88
waiting for

2631.839 --> 2638.88
why are you waiting

2634.88 --> 2642.1600000000003
it's here it has been here

2638.88 --> 2645.2000000000003
for a while up for grabs

2642.16 --> 2649.2799999999997
you have to take it you have to let go

2645.2 --> 2652.16
of your own limiters and fears

2649.28 --> 2655.52
preventing you from realizing it's there

2652.16 --> 2655.52
and grabbing a hold of it

2658.56 --> 2664.56
yeah well tara 306 yeah he will return

2661.599 --> 2665.599
you know he will return when we're truly

2664.56 --> 2668.72
defeated

2665.599 --> 2672.6400000000003
and there is nothing else left

2668.72 --> 2677.359
but until it's that time stop

2672.64 --> 2691.839
being weak stop surrendering to a vision

2677.359 --> 2691.839
where we are defeated

2696.54 --> 2705.839
[Music]

2702.839 --> 2705.839
so

2747.2 --> 2761.839
all right

2771.359 --> 2779.5989999999997
yeah that's it i think

2774.8 --> 2779.599
that's the gist of it you know

2780.72 --> 2785.68
christ is all about finding a way

2783.359 --> 2785.68
through

2786.839 --> 2792.4
foreseeing the option

2789.359 --> 2795.52
that had not been seen

2792.4 --> 2795.52
true insight

2797.839 --> 2802.4
based on spiritual principles that

2800.48 --> 2806.079
attuned to god

2802.4 --> 2809.44
and not divide and conquer me me me

2806.079 --> 2817.1600000000003
me that's it

2809.44 --> 2820.23
it's really that basic

2817.16 --> 2820.23
[Music]

2831.08 --> 2834.119
[Music]

2842.839 --> 2845.839
so

2848.64 --> 2859.839
yeah no [ __ ] is up to us dutch sailor

2850.72 --> 2859.839
but that's the whole point

2860.559 --> 2868.6400000000003
the main point is do

2863.839 --> 2873.839
something stop waiting

2868.64 --> 2873.839
for others to do something

2882.079 --> 2887.8390000000004
especially if you have something to do

2898.839 --> 2901.839
hmm

2920.16 --> 2929.839
[Music]

2926.839 --> 2929.839
so

2940.839 --> 2943.839
hmm

2954.839 --> 2957.839
hmm

2960.0 --> 2974.24
oh this looks interesting

2970.559 --> 2978.079
oh apparently there is a police for

2974.24 --> 2981.04
freedom march april 10th

2978.079 --> 2983.3590000000004
here in the netherlands with military

2981.04 --> 2986.48
police and

2983.359 --> 2986.48
medical personnel

2989.76 --> 2994.88
doing a protest against the corona

2991.599 --> 2994.88
measure that is awesome

2995.839 --> 3001.359
or rather the the against the

2998.96 --> 3003.599
constitutional violations that come from

3001.359 --> 3008.72
them to get more specific

3003.599 --> 3008.7200000000003
so that sounds interesting just read

3010.839 --> 3013.839
that

3028.64 --> 3032.16
oh yeah thanks that's it yeah it's just

3030.48 --> 3041.839
a bun

3032.16 --> 3041.839
but i finished it and it was nice

3060.0 --> 3065.359
hannah maria i don't know who that is

3062.16 --> 3065.359
slow-mo moon buggy

3066.8 --> 3083.8390000000004
i i literally just clicked on it

3091.119 --> 3096.6400000000003
so any more questions even spiritual

3094.839 --> 3100.0
questions

3096.64 --> 3101.92
i hope everybody got the points that i'm

3100.0 --> 3104.8
trying to make

3101.92 --> 3107.359
if you don't then please just tell me to

3104.8 --> 3107.3590000000004
elaborate

3109.2 --> 3113.2799999999997
i thought that i was keeping it kind of

3111.839 --> 3125.839
simple

3113.28 --> 3125.8390000000004
because it is that simple

3136.839 --> 3139.839
what

3164.839 --> 3167.839
so

3177.68 --> 3180.72
so anybody in here believe that unicorns

3180.0 --> 3184.16
may still

3180.72 --> 3185.52
exist in the inner earth or is there

3184.16 --> 3188.16
anybody

3185.52 --> 3191.2
that likes to hang on that unicorn

3188.16 --> 3191.2

3191.28 --> 3196.8
rhino rhinoceroses

3194.48 --> 3198.72
all right right now series no i don't

3196.8 --> 3201.44
why do you say that

3198.72 --> 3201.4399999999996
you know what i mean

3205.92 --> 3209.839
have you considered saying grace

3210.64 --> 3216.8799999999997
no i do my prayers during the cooking

3214.0 --> 3216.88
and preparation

3219.28 --> 3225.3590000000004
or rather i don't say them i just

3222.559 --> 3225.3590000000004
radiate them

3229.119 --> 3237.839
could be right oh god

3240.72 --> 3251.839
you know elves are what

3253.52 --> 3257.359
which sort of alpha are you talking

3262.839 --> 3265.839

hiding a blessing of unicorns what

3281.52 --> 3287.92
who knows man do

3284.72 --> 3290.9599999999996
it might be weird like that like

3287.92 --> 3292.799
yeah maybe there is there are still

3290.96 --> 3296.16
unicorns out there and they're all

3292.799 --> 3299.599
imprisoned and like hidden

3296.16 --> 3301.7599999999998
in some creepy temple somewhere in

3299.599 --> 3304.7200000000003
antarctica or something

3301.76 --> 3304.7200000000003

3350.559 --> 3355.119
by that same standard they kind of like

3353.359 --> 3355.7599999999998
haven't they had basically done that

3355.119 --> 3359.119
with

3355.76 --> 3362.48
aliens the greys as well

3359.119 --> 3364.6400000000003
it's really tough to be sure

3362.48 --> 3366.48
but i'm open for the suggestion that

3364.64 --> 3369.04
there might be all kinds of bizarre

3366.48 --> 3371.04
creatures out there

3369.04 --> 3377.2
that generally don't leave behind a lot

3371.04 --> 3379.41
of remnants

3377.2 --> 3382.5699999999997
so yeah maybe leprechauns as well

3379.41 --> 3382.5699999999997
[Music]

3383.119 --> 3391.839
uh i've never met one though

3386.4 --> 3395.839
or at least no

3391.839 --> 3395.839
well not where they fully uncloaked or

3402.839 --> 3405.839
anything

3413.119 --> 3419.839
right but yeah the ugly ones i

3416.16 --> 3419.839
just call them leprechauns

3435.119 --> 3440.6400000000003
but scotland is independent the unicorn

3437.68 --> 3440.64
will be unchained

3444.839 --> 3447.839
okay

3448.559 --> 3450.799
huh

3456.0 --> 3460.559
yeah tom parker well that's not the same

3457.92 --> 3475.839
kind of trolls though

3460.559 --> 3475.8390000000004
oh now it's hailing

3500.839 --> 3503.839
so

3511.28 --> 3517.8390000000004
all right okay so got another hour

3519.119 --> 3524.079
i hope to get a little bit more of a

3520.799 --> 3524.079
conversation out here

3525.119 --> 3530.48
but maybe i did kind of like spend

3528.16 --> 3531.5989999999997
all that energy from this wave on the

3530.48 --> 3534.16
last two shows

3531.599 --> 3534.1600000000003
i'm not sure

3535.04 --> 3545.839
hey amanda young good to see you

3570.839 --> 3573.839
hmm

3574.079 --> 3580.88
yeah dutch sailor there's plenty of that

3578.0 --> 3582.16
i've had my own period where i delved

3580.88 --> 3584.2400000000002
deeply into that

3582.16 --> 3585.52
i've did done a whole bunch of ghost

3584.24 --> 3589.4399999999996
research and just

3585.52 --> 3592.96
puzzling things out and i've had some

3589.44 --> 3593.76
interesting encounters i guess that in a

3592.96 --> 3597.28
way i still

3593.76 --> 3600.3190000000004
do it's just i deal with it

3597.28 --> 3603.599
differently now

3600.319 --> 3606.88
but like 20 years ago

3603.599 --> 3606.88
i was in my like

3606.96 --> 3611.599
i was kind of trying to be like a witch

3609.119 --> 3614.6400000000003
a good one

3611.599 --> 3616.559
yeah ghost situations all the time and

3614.64 --> 3620.64
just energy balances and

3616.559 --> 3620.6400000000003
like what's remaining in a house and

3621.2 --> 3624.16
and like the

3626.839 --> 3634.799
pressure sound effect responses

3631.44 --> 3638.4
like sort of telekinetic remnants

3634.799 --> 3643.599
or side effects i have that a lot of it

3638.4 --> 3647.359
like really and it's very funny to

3643.599 --> 3647.3590000000004
realize like how it works too

3647.76 --> 3654.96
because now for example there's like

3650.88 --> 3658.0
there's none of it it's kind of void

3654.96 --> 3660.48
but a lot of time when i go to bed

3658.0 --> 3663.76
is when kind of like i let down my

3660.48 --> 3667.04
barriers in many type of ways

3663.76 --> 3670.3190000000004
and then like a lot of sounds and

3667.04 --> 3671.599
clicks and bangs and snap sounds start

3670.319 --> 3674.24
happening and it's

3671.599 --> 3676.7200000000003
literally on the micro second in

3674.24 --> 3679.9199999999996
response to my thinking dynamics

3676.72 --> 3679.9199999999996
it's really weird

3681.2 --> 3685.359
it's literally i think about this oh the

3684.0 --> 3689.92
tension's building up i

3685.359 --> 3689.92
i snap away to another thought

3690.96 --> 3694.319
lamp or my computer desk or the monitor

3693.599 --> 3697.44
or the

3694.319 --> 3700.0
chair or something snaps

3697.44 --> 3700.559
a sound it's really weird how that

3700.0 --> 3704.799
happens

3700.559 --> 3707.2000000000003
whoa man sheesh

3704.799 --> 3708.24
this snow is starting to pack here this

3707.2 --> 3712.0789999999997
is crazy

3708.24 --> 3714.4799999999996
look at that

3712.079 --> 3714.48
damn

3718.64 --> 3723.7599999999998
ah there's somebody taking a hike out

3722.24 --> 3727.839
there

3723.76 --> 3727.8390000000004
i bet they didn't expect this to happen

3730.799 --> 3741.839
man this is almost like a blizzard

3736.079 --> 3741.8390000000004
crazy [ __ ]

3743.2 --> 3745.5989999999997
man

3750.24 --> 3755.4399999999996
look at that over there you can barely

3752.24 --> 3758.319
see anything from all the snow

3755.44 --> 3758.319
this is nuts

3764.24 --> 3769.839
and it got all dark now

3778.16 --> 3780.799
i mean look

3781.2 --> 3784.64
oh yeah it's already melted

3791.2 --> 3795.2
wow

3792.23 --> 3797.28
[Music]

3795.2 --> 3800.0
sure hope it ends before i go out for

3797.28 --> 3800.0
groceries

3800.319 --> 3803.7599999999998
because that would kind of suck

3804.16 --> 3814.24
or maybe not that well yeah i would suck

3811.52 --> 3814.24
yeah i wouldn't

3814.96 --> 3818.64
because there's also the wind you know

3816.559 --> 3820.88
it was just snow going down

3818.64 --> 3823.52
i wouldn't mind but when you're gonna

3820.88 --> 3825.839
get that [ __ ] in your face that's really

3823.52 --> 3825.839
annoying

3832.72 --> 3836.72
the whole lighting has changed so

3836.839 --> 3839.839
bizarre

3845.44 --> 3853.839
keep that snow stuff over there okay

3848.64 --> 3853.839
random explorer

3862.48 --> 3867.28
ah slow mo moon buggy yeah yeah those

3865.2 --> 3870.96
are annoying

3867.28 --> 3874.2400000000002
spirits that kind of like they're too

3870.96 --> 3876.079
skitty they're they're too scaredy cat

3874.24 --> 3877.52
to basically just face you because

3876.079 --> 3878.48
they're too scaredy cat to face

3877.52 --> 3881.28
themselves

3878.48 --> 3884.88
like those go those types of ghosts

3881.28 --> 3884.88
those spirits that linger

3888.079 --> 3892.88
like they're scaredy cats that's why

3890.88 --> 3895.039
they do that

3892.88 --> 3898.2400000000002
and that scaredness nervousness might

3895.039 --> 3901.599
rub off on you if you get too close

3898.24 --> 3903.359
but it's basically that that's

3901.599 --> 3905.599
that's how they are that's their essence

3903.359 --> 3905.5989999999997
then

3906.48 --> 3910.2400000000002
scaredy cat goes a lot of ghosts are

3908.24 --> 3913.9199999999996
like very frightened

3910.24 --> 3915.7599999999998
essen have a frightened essence

3913.92 --> 3917.76
like i wouldn't worry too much about it

3915.76 --> 3920.88
like ghosts are extremely

3917.76 --> 3924.4
impotent okay they can literally do

3920.88 --> 3926.96
absolutely nothing but if you have

3924.4 --> 3929.599
panic or whatever then yeah they might

3926.96 --> 3929.599
influence

3933.359 --> 3938.0
but on their own once you're truly

3936.24 --> 3941.1189999999997
protected

3938.0 --> 3943.2
you know what is what who you are not

3941.119 --> 3947.2000000000003
afraid of things you don't understand

3943.2 --> 3947.2
there's absolutely nothing they can do

3948.839 --> 3951.839
nothing

3962.839 --> 3965.839
so

3976.839 --> 3979.839
hmm

3980.319 --> 3983.7599999999998
right

3982.23 --> 3986.079
[Music]

3983.76 --> 3986.079
what

3988.96 --> 3996.2400000000002
now the sun's coming through the snow

3992.48 --> 3999.92
that's what

3996.24 --> 3999.9199999999996
the snow is going upward

4000.079 --> 4002.559
what the

4003.92 --> 4007.839
serious it's going up i think that the

4007.44 --> 4010.319
heat

4007.839 --> 4012.88
the heating up of the sunlight for

4010.319 --> 4016.48
everything down there is literally just

4012.88 --> 4021.839
pushing the snow that's coming down up

4016.48 --> 4021.839
this is weird

4029.68 --> 4035.839
very strange weather today

4047.359 --> 4053.52
right yes so slow mo moon buggy

4050.4 --> 4054.079
like if something like that is bothering

4053.52 --> 4057.119
you

4054.079 --> 4057.599
you gotta realize that ghosts are kind

4057.119 --> 4060.799
of like

4057.599 --> 4063.44
chat trolls they literally

4060.799 --> 4065.44
have no life they have nothing better to

4063.44 --> 4065.839
do and they're very good at trying to

4065.44 --> 4067.92
grab

4065.839 --> 4071.119
your attention trying to distract you

4067.92 --> 4073.52
away from your normal

4071.119 --> 4074.6400000000003
things that you're normally focused on

4073.52 --> 4079.0389999999998
see

4074.64 --> 4082.319
so they're basically the trolls

4079.039 --> 4082.3190000000004
of the physical world

4084.48 --> 4088.559
i know maybe you appreciate that

4086.799 --> 4090.4
comparison

4088.559 --> 4091.76
i really think i'm on to something with

4090.4 --> 4094.1600000000003
that

4091.76 --> 4096.319
because a lot of ghosts are just there

4094.16 --> 4097.199
to distract you to get in your way and

4096.319 --> 4099.6
they can

4097.199 --> 4100.48
they can mess you up if you zoom in on

4099.6 --> 4102.96
it

4100.48 --> 4105.04
or if you try to make their problem your

4102.96 --> 4108.319
problem and try to solve it all right

4105.04 --> 4111.359
well it's just like dealing with a troll

4108.319 --> 4112.64
trolls are very thick they have their

4111.359 --> 4114.96
mind made up

4112.64 --> 4115.839
they have all the defense responses

4114.96 --> 4118.319
ready

4115.839 --> 4120.4
and the person they're controlling sized

4118.319 --> 4122.2390000000005
up

4120.4 --> 4125.2789999999995
at least if they're a real troll not

4122.239 --> 4125.2789999999995
just some loser

4128.319 --> 4135.6
and they're just there to to nag you to

4132.08 --> 4137.759
distract you away to break your flow

4135.6 --> 4147.839
to decrease your energy output that's

4137.759 --> 4147.839
what trolls do and ghosts do that too

4152.799 --> 4158.0
well if you felt it was unsettling then

4155.359 --> 4161.759
it did bother you

4158.0 --> 4174.319
isn't feeling unsettling bothering

4161.759 --> 4177.12
i'd say it is

4174.319 --> 4178.400000000001
it's not like they came towards you as a

4177.12 --> 4181.599999999999
spirit and we're like

4178.4 --> 4183.3589999999995
oh i see you can see me can you please

4181.6 --> 4187.4400000000005
help me out of this

4183.359 --> 4191.4400000000005
you know can you please help me move on

4187.44 --> 4191.44
some ghosts do that by the way

4191.679 --> 4195.92
so if they weren't do that well yeah

4193.6 --> 4198.4800000000005
that's exactly like trolls isn't there

4195.92 --> 4200.56
isn't they like the trolls come in

4198.48 --> 4201.599999999999
familiar channels they troll you with

4200.56 --> 4205.52
the typical

4201.6 --> 4207.04
why why are they specifically coming to

4205.52 --> 4209.6
you

4207.04 --> 4211.36
and trolling you based on what you

4209.6 --> 4214.4800000000005
typically talk about

4211.36 --> 4217.839999999999
it's because they can't

4214.48 --> 4217.839999999999
move on

4220.0 --> 4231.84
because most ghosts are like trolls

4224.88 --> 4231.84
they're the spirit jet trolls

4233.04 --> 4239.44
man that's i just

4236.08 --> 4241.6
dug up a big old nugget here

4239.44 --> 4245.839999999999
i'm definitely gonna call this hangout

4241.6 --> 4245.84
to this

4247.53 --> 4251.53
[Music]

4261.36 --> 4267.839999999999
right because maybe you could consider

4264.0 --> 4267.84
it like this maybe beyond life

4269.6 --> 4274.159000000001
maybe to those that have actually died

4272.64 --> 4275.92
to have lost the direct

4274.159 --> 4277.839999999999
interface connection of the physical

4275.92 --> 4281.679
body with the realm

4277.84 --> 4285.04
maybe they consider the realm

4281.679 --> 4288.0
like an internet like serving on

4285.04 --> 4290.32
surfing on the internet except it's a 3d

4288.0 --> 4290.32
realm

4292.239 --> 4296.799999999999
so maybe they are kind of like chat

4294.4 --> 4298.879999999999
trolls just like some people can also

4296.8 --> 4299.52
get into chat and basically ask for a

4298.88 --> 4302.32
solution

4299.52 --> 4303.1990000000005
ask a question get a response if they're

4302.32 --> 4305.84
picked up

4303.199 --> 4307.04
move on kind of like a medium could help

4305.84 --> 4309.52
a ghost to

4307.04 --> 4310.4
resolve while they're stuck help them

4309.52 --> 4313.280000000001
move on

4310.4 --> 4314.0
like i've i've been through those

4313.28 --> 4317.599999999999
situations

4314.0 --> 4319.199
like i did that sort of thing i thought

4317.6 --> 4325.280000000001
it was fascinating to do

4319.199 --> 4325.28
now i'm talking about like 2005.

4325.679 --> 4328.88
it was a medium i knew it was kind of

4328.239 --> 4332.799999999999
fresh

4328.88 --> 4335.6
so i even helped her train that

4332.8 --> 4337.12
like we were kind of like a team but

4335.6 --> 4338.320000000001
there was all kinds of things wrong with

4337.12 --> 4340.88
the whole setup anyway

4338.32 --> 4343.04
it's like non-christian very

4340.88 --> 4346.56
non-christian

4343.04 --> 4349.04
she was more like a germanic pantheon

4346.56 --> 4351.360000000001
type of person but i can't respect that

4349.04 --> 4352.48
but still there was things wrong and

4351.36 --> 4356.5599999999995
hidden

4352.48 --> 4360.32
and myself included you know i was not

4356.56 --> 4363.360000000001
was not in my best spiritual form

4360.32 --> 4364.4
but we did also just like pick up on

4363.36 --> 4367.5199999999995
ghosts and even

4364.4 --> 4370.719
as we formed like this team ghosts would

4367.52 --> 4374.4800000000005
literally just start to be like hey

4370.719 --> 4375.36
hey there's somebody that can pick me up

4374.48 --> 4378.239
now

4375.36 --> 4380.4
and then kind of like through yeah

4378.239 --> 4384.0
spiritual messages come to us

4380.4 --> 4384.719
ask us like for help or not even ask us

4384.0 --> 4387.44
for help but

4384.719 --> 4389.36
rather just lay down complaints like oh

4387.44 --> 4391.599999999999
i'm sad about this i'm sad about that i

4389.36 --> 4393.839999999999
don't know what to do

4391.6 --> 4395.52
and then we would just tell it like we

4393.84 --> 4397.28
would realize like okay this

4395.52 --> 4399.4400000000005
is exactly their mindset and their

4397.28 --> 4402.159
feeling i would be a psychologer

4399.44 --> 4403.5199999999995
i've been psychology for ghosts okay and

4402.159 --> 4407.679
it worked

4403.52 --> 4410.2390000000005
yeah put that on the arwin crazy stick

4407.679 --> 4411.28
yeah i've been a psychology to ghosts

4410.239 --> 4413.759999999999
successfully

4411.28 --> 4417.36
help them move on i'm very proud of it

4413.76 --> 4417.360000000001
even though it's kind of weird to say

4419.04 --> 4426.239
so if i can do it with ghosts should be

4421.92 --> 4430.8
able to do it with people

4426.239 --> 4430.799999999999
have done with people too you know

4431.199 --> 4436.5599999999995
rhys only sheep who can't see despite

4434.0 --> 4440.32
him turning out to be in global

4436.56 --> 4442.4800000000005
like he stills he still talks about that

4440.32 --> 4444.639999999999
he has honored me

4442.48 --> 4446.4
for yeah helping him in a time when he

4444.64 --> 4455.84
really needed it and i recognized that

4446.4 --> 4455.839999999999
he really needed it

4458.48 --> 4468.239
okay emmen ghosts of captain walter h

4463.6 --> 4471.6
mulliken who is that

4468.239 --> 4471.599999999999
i don't recognize that name

4472.96 --> 4479.36
has it a good love now is he

4476.239 --> 4480.959999999999
watches it yeah

4479.36 --> 4483.839999999999
maybe you should do something about your

4480.96 --> 4483.84
english

4497.92 --> 4504.08
oh there are beings beside us

4501.04 --> 4505.84
flesh and blood humans

4504.08 --> 4508.0
how do you know how do you know they're

4505.84 --> 4511.84
just not humans how do you know it's not

4508.0 --> 4511.84
just spirit

4514.159 --> 4521.12
like even through

4517.92 --> 4522.96
just psychokinetics even if you don't

4521.12 --> 4526.5599999999995
have control over it

4522.96 --> 4528.88
it can do stuff or rather like

4526.56 --> 4531.360000000001
other things outside of yourself or even

4528.88 --> 4533.76
like your ego as a separate entity

4531.36 --> 4535.839999999999
couldn't use your abilities that you

4533.76 --> 4539.52
consciously might not be able to control

4535.84 --> 4542.08
to do stuff

4539.52 --> 4543.84
and that mechanism which is tightening

4542.08 --> 4546.88
with living beings might also

4543.84 --> 4549.679
still remain after death

4546.88 --> 4549.679
in ghosts

4551.6 --> 4556.2390000000005
i don't know it might also be a side

4554.32 --> 4558.4
effect of somebody like ghosts may

4556.239 --> 4560.718999999999
literally be able to manifest

4558.4 --> 4563.199
physical interactions by lending this

4560.719 --> 4568.64
psych this dormant psychokinetic energy

4563.199 --> 4568.639999999999
from people are alive

4575.52 --> 4581.76
right the idea of a medium being

4578.64 --> 4582.88
a receiver so they take on a spirit of

4581.76 --> 4585.280000000001
another

4582.88 --> 4586.56
they become the receiver right so the

4585.28 --> 4590.32
spirit does it

4586.56 --> 4592.64
through them well that may apply for

4590.32 --> 4595.5199999999995
a lot of those mechanisms including

4592.64 --> 4599.04
psychokinetic activity

4595.52 --> 4599.040000000001
right poltergeist

4600.32 --> 4603.92
right that's uh roughly how they've

4602.4 --> 4606.879999999999
identified it

4603.92 --> 4609.4400000000005
when it gets pretty extreme well

4606.88 --> 4614.719
poltergeist is not controlled

4609.44 --> 4619.04
by somebody it's a side effect

4614.719 --> 4622.159
it's psychokinetic energy

4619.04 --> 4624.56
wildly doing things

4622.159 --> 4626.48
outside of conscious control but as an

4624.56 --> 4630.159000000001
ego response it's like

4626.48 --> 4637.839999999999
that's what it is that's what it does

4630.159 --> 4637.839999999999
come on

4643.04 --> 4648.88
you are am i saying you have slumbering

4645.12 --> 4651.599999999999
powers in you yeah well maybe you do

4648.88 --> 4652.32
i wouldn't be surprised i think a lot of

4651.6 --> 4654.96
people that

4652.32 --> 4657.679
typically hang around here have that one

4654.96 --> 4657.679
way or another

4658.96 --> 4662.2390000000005
because if you don't then almost nothing

4661.6 --> 4665.84
i say

4662.239 --> 4665.839999999999
will mean anything to you

4667.12 --> 4672.08
right that's the issue if you don't have

4670.0 --> 4673.28
the talent if you don't have the powers

4672.08 --> 4675.44
in you

4673.28 --> 4677.44
then the things that i talk about is

4675.44 --> 4680.08
just not gonna mean anything to you

4677.44 --> 4680.879999999999
it's just gonna be weird wizard arwin

4680.08 --> 4684.08
elf

4680.88 --> 4686.56
and his vague talk about

4684.08 --> 4688.96
spirit stuff and blah blah blah don't

4686.56 --> 4688.96
get it

4689.12 --> 4694.239
it's just being vague right

4696.719 --> 4701.12
because i just addressed very subtle

4702.719 --> 4708.159
patterns mechanisms in the human mind

4706.159 --> 4710.879999999999
in the spirit in the world and its

4708.159 --> 4713.12
interactions i do that a lot

4710.88 --> 4714.56
and unless you have the faculties in the

4713.12 --> 4717.28
senses to actually

4714.56 --> 4720.080000000001
recognize any of it it's not gonna mean

4717.28 --> 4723.36
anything to you

4720.08 --> 4724.88
it's just gonna slip you by so yeah if

4723.36 --> 4726.4
you're saying oh you might have some

4724.88 --> 4728.08
slumbering powers

4726.4 --> 4731.36
well i wouldn't be surprised because

4728.08 --> 4731.36
you're hanging around here

4731.52 --> 4736.159000000001
you have you have valid input

4739.04 --> 4749.84
people that don't have powers tend to

4741.679 --> 4749.84
not like me

4751.84 --> 4763.84
and well vice versa

4756.48 --> 4763.839999999999
but i don't hold it against you

4772.56 --> 4777.04
demons are angels the way to recognize

4774.64 --> 4778.96
them is to call in jesus christ

4777.04 --> 4780.56
well that's one way of doing it you

4778.96 --> 4784.159
could also just

4780.56 --> 4785.6
feel it deduce it recognize the

4784.159 --> 4788.639999999999
frequency

4785.6 --> 4790.96
that helps going by their suggestions

4788.64 --> 4794.0
their methods their

4790.96 --> 4796.08
unspoken driving force

4794.0 --> 4797.76
you can determine them you wouldn't

4796.08 --> 4800.159
necessarily have to

4797.76 --> 4800.96
invoke jesus christ to clarify that but

4800.159 --> 4805.36
it could

4800.96 --> 4808.2390000000005
work and hey if you're getting bothered

4805.36 --> 4810.32
by demons for example yeah of course

4808.239 --> 4812.718999999999
invoking jesus christ is very effective

4810.32 --> 4814.4
i i literally did that two days ago in

4812.719 --> 4815.76
the night when suddenly some weird

4814.4 --> 4818.96
creepy [ __ ]

4815.76 --> 4822.08
came came afloat or rather just

4818.96 --> 4825.52
descended down upon my mind really

4822.08 --> 4827.6
with me not wanting that and then i did

4825.52 --> 4833.84
invoke jesus christ very seriously and

4827.6 --> 4833.84
that works

4834.57 --> 4837.648999999999
[Music]

4840.08 --> 4843.679
yeah that sailor yeah

4843.84 --> 4848.96
oh that those that's funny because

4847.199 --> 4852.0
now you're addressing something that

4848.96 --> 4857.44
will typically happen

4852.0 --> 4857.44
as you delve deeper it's basically

4857.52 --> 4862.639
the deeper you delve into the the power

4860.4 --> 4863.759999999999
and the realization of what you can do

4862.639 --> 4866.08
what you are

4863.76 --> 4868.56
everything the more weird

4866.08 --> 4871.28
synchronicities start to happen

4868.56 --> 4872.0
to you the own benjamin has this [ __ ]

4871.28 --> 4874.96
all the time

4872.0 --> 4877.52
like a lot of it because he is wielding

4874.96 --> 4880.639
some serious bardic powers okay

4877.52 --> 4880.639
it's very serious stuff

4882.159 --> 4891.28
so if yeah not surprised

4888.159 --> 4892.159
you read the book you thought about it

4891.28 --> 4895.5199999999995
now you

4892.159 --> 4896.4
you real yeah you realize maybe you got

4895.52 --> 4899.4400000000005
some of that

4896.4 --> 4901.599999999999
well it could be but look i never got my

4899.44 --> 4904.4
telekinesis under control

4901.6 --> 4905.360000000001
i got my out bursting under control so

4904.4 --> 4908.4
i've kind of even

4905.36 --> 4911.5199999999995
managed to utilize my not under control

4908.4 --> 4911.5199999999995
power in some way

4912.0 --> 4915.28
like that but i've never managed to

4914.4 --> 4917.44
actually get

4915.28 --> 4919.5199999999995
a telekinetic process under control

4917.44 --> 4921.678999999999
which to my great regret because i kind

4919.52 --> 4924.96
of always wanted to

4921.679 --> 4928.4
but i think it just it can't really work

4924.96 --> 4931.04
for me or not yet

4928.4 --> 4932.96
anyway i might i don't know i don't know

4931.04 --> 4936.32
if i should be allowed to

4932.96 --> 4936.32
if god allows me to

4937.92 --> 4942.88
or it simply might not be necessary

4940.48 --> 4944.0
because every power is eventually just

4942.88 --> 4947.84
only a burden

4944.0 --> 4951.679
it really really is

4947.84 --> 4954.639
right it really is and i know this

4951.679 --> 4954.639
from experience

4957.52 --> 4962.639
right only real thing

4960.56 --> 4963.679
powers are good for is to meet a

4962.639 --> 4965.4400000000005
challenge

4963.679 --> 4967.36
because if you're just looking for power

4965.44 --> 4970.32
for power sake you're gonna get a

4967.36 --> 4970.32
a ring effect

4970.4 --> 4977.28
it's gonna turn you into a golem almost

4973.76 --> 4979.52
always with real power that always does

4977.28 --> 4979.5199999999995
that

4985.28 --> 4988.8
like i got certain types of powers that

4988.239 --> 4992.08
i would

4988.8 --> 4995.04
never call upon unless i thought

4992.08 --> 4996.4
i must i must because i have a specific

4995.04 --> 4999.6
challenge

4996.4 --> 5000.48
with the world right now so i'm called

4999.6 --> 5004.08
upon

5000.48 --> 5006.08
to use it and then it doesn't corrupt me

5004.08 --> 5015.84
because it's there for a reason

5006.08 --> 5015.84
and not to claim me see

5020.92 --> 5023.999
[Music]

5026.26 --> 5031.679
[Music]

5027.6 --> 5031.679
where can we claim the price what

5040.0 --> 5043.84
oh yeah a big money price in many

5042.719 --> 5047.199
countries

5043.84 --> 5050.56
to prove supernatural talent

5047.199 --> 5055.839999999999
to a bunch of gravelers yeah sure

5050.56 --> 5058.2390000000005
sure yeah no no the thing about it is

5055.84 --> 5058.2390000000005
people

5058.48 --> 5062.239
they don't have time for that [ __ ]

5064.239 --> 5068.879999999999
right everybody's that follows it has

5067.04 --> 5071.28
too much time on their hands they're

5068.88 --> 5074.2390000000005
using it to escape in they don't

5071.28 --> 5076.159
or barely develop powers because when

5074.239 --> 5077.678999999999
they do they get confronted with the

5076.159 --> 5080.48
price

5077.679 --> 5082.56
yeah as i told you when you seek out

5080.48 --> 5085.759999999999
power

5082.56 --> 5087.1990000000005
without a specific necessity the power

5085.76 --> 5089.84
will take you

5087.199 --> 5091.36
and that's why amongst paranormal

5089.84 --> 5094.159000000001
followers you don't see

5091.36 --> 5098.08
really powerful people because that's a

5094.159 --> 5101.28
waste of their time

5098.08 --> 5102.159
right they realize the weight of the

5101.28 --> 5104.159
power

5102.159 --> 5106.32
to which all that paranormal stuff

5104.159 --> 5107.679
actually hints they know the actual

5106.32 --> 5110.0
weight of it

5107.679 --> 5112.719
right this myth of this magical

5110.0 --> 5116.08
spiritual power without any kind of

5112.719 --> 5118.32
influence on you is just a myth

5116.08 --> 5119.28
it's a grabbler myth it's just oh take

5118.32 --> 5123.12
all the power it's

5119.28 --> 5126.8
literally a basic lucifer seduction

5123.12 --> 5128.48
take all the power it'll be great you

5126.8 --> 5130.08
can do anything you want and then you

5128.48 --> 5132.638999999999
take it and guess what

5130.08 --> 5133.679
you can do nothing because the power

5132.639 --> 5135.92
took you

5133.679 --> 5138.08
and now you're not even you anymore

5135.92 --> 5140.4
everything you wanted the power for

5138.08 --> 5141.199
certainly doesn't mean anything anymore

5140.4 --> 5142.719
and you just

5141.199 --> 5144.5599999999995
are there to take the weight of the

5142.719 --> 5155.84
power yeah

5144.56 --> 5155.84
that's it

5160.32 --> 5165.199
telekinesis stops working no it's not

5163.04 --> 5167.04
how that works at all now telekinesis

5165.199 --> 5170.48
for me is a side effect

5167.04 --> 5173.84
i've never managed to i've never

5170.48 --> 5176.48
met somebody that could basically

5173.84 --> 5179.4400000000005
that has a really ha that has freaking

5176.48 --> 5182.799999999999
wizard level insight on how that works

5179.44 --> 5185.919999999999
that has been willing

5182.8 --> 5188.0
to trade me i think i could be trained i

5185.92 --> 5189.4400000000005
still have a lot of dormant power i

5188.0 --> 5192.08
think it could be trained

5189.44 --> 5192.879999999999
i've got some function for it but it is

5192.08 --> 5195.6
wild

5192.88 --> 5196.0
it is raw it is basically controlled by

5195.6 --> 5199.120000000001
my

5196.0 --> 5202.48
ego and

5199.12 --> 5204.8
i control my ego enough to

5202.48 --> 5205.599999999999
control it in some ways very convoluted

5204.8 --> 5208.2390000000005
and complex

5205.6 --> 5210.719
and it's still wild and raw but there's

5208.239 --> 5213.5199999999995
probably other ways for me to

5210.719 --> 5214.08
get it under control better and i

5213.52 --> 5217.360000000001
haven't

5214.08 --> 5219.84
gotten to that point could be that i've

5217.36 --> 5222.839999999999
some people have actually suggested that

5219.84 --> 5224.32
to me but those people were freaking

5222.84 --> 5227.679
evil

5224.32 --> 5231.28
and so i declined

5227.679 --> 5234.2390000000005
because then yeah they teach you for

5231.28 --> 5239.84
a reason they teach you to get in you

5234.239 --> 5239.839999999999
inside of you

5249.6 --> 5254.719
right so and then yeah telekinesis stops

5252.8 --> 5258.719
working every time you try

5254.719 --> 5260.32
no it never worked it never worked with

5258.719 --> 5262.32
my conscience it's rather when my

5260.32 --> 5264.08
conscience lets go that's when it starts

5262.32 --> 5265.759999999999
to manifest

5264.08 --> 5267.84
right so that's why it typically happens

5265.76 --> 5270.96
when i

5267.84 --> 5272.96
go to bed because i'm letting go and

5270.96 --> 5276.32
then suddenly all the telekinetic

5272.96 --> 5276.32
side effects start happening

5279.12 --> 5283.679
and like seriously everybody can testify

5282.0 --> 5285.76
to that that has known me

5283.679 --> 5287.36
my mother had that [ __ ] too by the way a

5285.76 --> 5294.4800000000005
lot

5287.36 --> 5297.679
and so did i we shared that no so yeah

5294.48 --> 5297.678999999999
might be hereditary

5300.8 --> 5305.84
so basically it's like bsg martial art

5303.76 --> 5308.56
stuff

5305.84 --> 5310.8
yeah you go tell yourself that that's bs

5308.56 --> 5314.2390000000005
mn

5310.8 --> 5318.0
yeah no yeti

5314.239 --> 5321.919999999999
martial arts stuff is real

5318.0 --> 5324.159
and works really well it is another way

5321.92 --> 5328.4800000000005
of dealing with the same energy

5324.159 --> 5331.28
right it's that same energy

5328.48 --> 5332.5599999999995
except you use it at more close

5331.28 --> 5335.599999999999
proximity

5332.56 --> 5337.360000000001
you focus dude i've never

5335.6 --> 5339.120000000001
literally done it but i've done

5337.36 --> 5341.44
improvised training

5339.12 --> 5343.84
it's not even that difficult like i've

5341.44 --> 5345.919999999999
done taekwondo

5343.84 --> 5348.96
and i learned some bizarre tricks with

5345.92 --> 5350.4
that with your focus

5348.96 --> 5352.56
completely on my own not through the

5350.4 --> 5355.92
sports

5352.56 --> 5359.04
but in that period and

5355.92 --> 5361.56
yeah it's not [ __ ]

5359.04 --> 5363.6
just because you're lame and

5361.56 --> 5366.8
desensitized and you can't do

5363.6 --> 5368.719
[ __ ] can even get your spirit to

5366.8 --> 5370.639
basically focus like a normal human

5368.719 --> 5372.159
being doesn't mean that it doesn't exist

5370.639 --> 5375.92
it just means that you're too

5372.159 --> 5378.5599999999995
weak to recognize its existence

5375.92 --> 5380.56
because that would burden you just a

5378.56 --> 5382.96
little bit more with how freaking weak

5380.56 --> 5382.96
you are

5390.84 --> 5396.6
amen

5393.49 --> 5396.599999999999
[Music]

5399.679 --> 5402.719
so they're trying to fight with real

5401.52 --> 5405.040000000001
fighters yeah well

5402.719 --> 5405.76
that's because real fighters have

5405.04 --> 5408.8
different

5405.76 --> 5411.92
skill range right

5408.8 --> 5415.12
these tricks yeah they work but

5411.92 --> 5419.04
the spirit can't maintain that long-term

5415.12 --> 5421.28
level of abilities it runs out

5419.04 --> 5422.159
well the body with a trained fighter

5421.28 --> 5425.199
that has like

5422.159 --> 5428.239
everything they need for that yeah

5425.199 --> 5431.599999999999
it's built for endurance the biggest

5428.239 --> 5433.678999999999
factor in all physical sports especially

5431.6 --> 5437.1990000000005
fighting sports

5433.679 --> 5440.56
it's endurance all about

5437.199 --> 5442.638999999999
endurance right so yeah spiritual

5440.56 --> 5444.4800000000005
cheat tricks it does work and it

5442.639 --> 5447.1990000000005
especially works

5444.48 --> 5448.0
against those that don't expect it it's

5447.199 --> 5450.719
very effective

5448.0 --> 5451.52
for quick strike situations but yeah

5450.719 --> 5454.32
eventually

5451.52 --> 5455.52
if you don't take the opponent the

5454.32 --> 5458.239
beefcake down

5455.52 --> 5460.159000000001
right away they're going to out

5458.239 --> 5463.839999999999
endurance you

5460.159 --> 5463.839999999999
so yeah of course

5468.719 --> 5474.56
oh man you're such a pathetic [ __ ]

5471.6 --> 5474.56
get the [ __ ] out

5475.6 --> 5479.4400000000005
it's like serious i'm throwing pearls

5477.84 --> 5481.76
for swines here guys

5479.44 --> 5483.36
this is just embarrassing like he says

5481.76 --> 5485.92
something i take it literally i

5483.36 --> 5487.04
actually give a good piece of advice and

5485.92 --> 5489.1990000000005
then

5487.04 --> 5491.679
oh i mean you're projecting you didn't

5489.199 --> 5493.759999999999
even freaking hear what i just said

5491.679 --> 5495.84
i just said a whole bunch of sensible

5493.76 --> 5498.719
things and you tell me i'm projecting

5495.84 --> 5500.5
well you're slow and you're lame and now

5498.719 --> 5502.84
you're banned

5500.5 --> 5505.84
[Music]

5502.84 --> 5505.84
ugh

5508.42 --> 5511.439
[Music]

5527.84 --> 5533.84
hmm basic he literally just tried to

5534.56 --> 5541.52
outdo the spiritual by showing

5538.0 --> 5544.32
oh look beefcakes can win too

5541.52 --> 5546.080000000001
yeah i know it's a whole another

5544.32 --> 5549.36
discipline it's all about endurance

5546.08 --> 5552.5599999999995
that's really ask any professional

5549.36 --> 5554.799999999999
it's all about endurance

5552.56 --> 5554.8
right

5555.679 --> 5562.88
yeah and the spiritual trick

5559.04 --> 5563.679
masters they master an art they master a

5562.88 --> 5566.400000000001
skill

5563.679 --> 5568.08
they're usually not like life dedicated

5566.4 --> 5572.08
beefcake sporters

5568.08 --> 5574.88
that are just going to absolutely like

5572.08 --> 5575.6
just torture themselves to get like a

5574.88 --> 5579.04
maximum

5575.6 --> 5583.92
endurance right

5579.04 --> 5583.92
it's a whole different range of of going

5586.84 --> 5589.84
about

5600.84 --> 5603.84
here

5607.12 --> 5614.88
ah now i regret banning him because even

5610.96 --> 5616.0
even stupid trolls ask good questions

5614.88 --> 5617.92
give lame responses

5616.0 --> 5619.28
but yeah still good questions and then i

5617.92 --> 5621.28
got to put

5619.28 --> 5625.04
down some piece of information even

5621.28 --> 5625.04
though it was wasted on them

5626.0 --> 5631.84
i guess that's the story of my life

5634.56 --> 5645.84
all right be back two minutes

5670.84 --> 5673.84
so

5698.84 --> 5701.84
foreign

5738.88 --> 5743.84
oh hello andrew

5751.679 --> 5757.84
got a link got a link to what john

5754.84 --> 5757.84
hawkins

5769.52 --> 5776.639
that's right foul lambo cannon i agree

5773.199 --> 5779.759999999999
well i've met some intense people too

5776.639 --> 5781.6
like that and then

5779.76 --> 5783.679
this is what would happen like they

5781.6 --> 5787.280000000001
would recognize i have some too

5783.679 --> 5788.32
and then my ego would be like i don't

5787.28 --> 5790.639
like you

5788.32 --> 5793.36
you have more energy than me i am

5790.639 --> 5794.88
criticizing you for being too calm with

5793.36 --> 5797.5199999999995
it

5794.88 --> 5798.08
seriously that was like what would

5797.52 --> 5801.360000000001
typically

5798.08 --> 5804.88
happen that's when i was younger now

5801.36 --> 5806.88
over time i've learned to deal

5804.88 --> 5808.4800000000005
with basically the counterbalance of the

5806.88 --> 5810.2390000000005
power which is your ego and that's the

5808.48 --> 5810.638999999999
whole challenge and that's the challenge

5810.239 --> 5812.5599999999995
too

5810.639 --> 5814.96
for those that are really strong with

5812.56 --> 5818.719
spirit it's all about

5814.96 --> 5818.719
having that ego under control

5824.08 --> 5827.679
all right yeah yeah uh seeking star wars

5826.56 --> 5831.119000000001
if you want to post

5827.679 --> 5831.119

5835.119 --> 5841.839999999999
sean hawkins wants it i guess

5852.84 --> 5855.84
so

5880.84 --> 5883.84
hmm

5895.6 --> 5903.52
we are all harry potter's carp

5899.92 --> 5906.56
do you have to say like that really

5903.52 --> 5909.4400000000005
i just don't know it no no most

5906.56 --> 5911.84
people are not like harry potters no

5909.44 --> 5911.839999999999
they're not

5912.56 --> 5919.6
most people if they have any have

5916.239 --> 5922.879999999999
very limited or very specific

5919.6 --> 5925.360000000001
powers and

5922.88 --> 5928.08
where they will be in their life

5925.36 --> 5930.799999999999
position in their spirit level

5928.08 --> 5932.239
is just not going to have room to do

5930.8 --> 5934.96
anything with it

5932.239 --> 5936.839999999999
so with most people it's just dormant

5934.96 --> 5953.84
and it's supposed to be

5936.84 --> 5953.84
dormant it would only get in the way

i don't know i'm kind of done for today

6361.119 --> 6367.599999999999

6364.56 --> 6370.96
stream flow of

6367.6 --> 6375.360000000001
well the ethereal subjects and ghosts

6370.96 --> 6376.8

i think i'm just gonna round out the

6376.8 --> 6379.679
show for today

6379.92 --> 6384.639
unless um somebody just immediately

6382.56 --> 6388.0
interjects

6384.639 --> 6389.76
and presents a whole plethora of things

6388.0 --> 6392.719
i could

6389.76 --> 6395.04
go talk about in depth in these last 10

6392.719 --> 6395.04
minutes

6398.639 --> 6403.679
nathan's show is great mostly but i

6401.04 --> 6407.119
didn't like how you got hijacked

6403.679 --> 6409.4400000000005
i got hijacked what what are you talking

6407.119 --> 6409.44
about

6410.239 --> 6416.879999999999
i have my own show here

6414.08 --> 6417.6
like nathan can hijack me talk over me

6416.88 --> 6421.04
or even

6417.6 --> 6423.04
say are we in as much as he likes

6421.04 --> 6425.04
because i have my own show and if i have

6423.04 --> 6426.08
a problem with it then i can talk about

6425.04 --> 6428.0
it for two

6426.08 --> 6429.6
hours straight and there's nothing he

6428.0 --> 6432.719
can do to stop me

6429.6 --> 6436.400000000001
right and that's good enough for me

6432.719 --> 6436.4
not that i am going to do that

6440.639 --> 6444.32
and hey this just i have my moments when

6443.36 --> 6447.28
i am kind of

6444.32 --> 6449.119
dominant getting in the way a little

6447.28 --> 6449.84
trying to break pregnant pauses and all

6449.119 --> 6451.199
that

6449.84 --> 6453.1990000000005
and then there's other moments where i

6451.199 --> 6454.799999999999
don't do that at all and i'm very

6453.199 --> 6456.4
attracted and then it's other people

6454.8 --> 6458.639
that do that

6456.4 --> 6460.08
and brian or flatzoid will start doing

6458.639 --> 6464.2390000000005
that or a tenth man can't stop

6460.08 --> 6464.239
blabbering his mouth you know

6466.96 --> 6473.92
not nathan what the aussie whiz guy

6470.32 --> 6473.92

6484.88 --> 6489.92
hijacked

6485.76 --> 6493.119000000001
merle just started to kind of like

6489.92 --> 6496.4
do his blabber mouth ego thing

6493.119 --> 6496.839999999999
and it was quite pathetic so i put him

6496.4 --> 6500.239
in his

6496.84 --> 6502.4800000000005
place arwenian style it's like oh you're

6500.239 --> 6505.199
going to unwizard me

6502.48 --> 6508.32
you're barely coherent half psychotic

6505.199 --> 6512.4
demon possessed idiot

6508.32 --> 6514.48
yeah that's don't face a wizard

6512.4 --> 6516.239
when you're like half spiritually

6514.48 --> 6518.5599999999995
crippled

6516.239 --> 6519.678999999999
you can you can call yourself a wizard

6518.56 --> 6521.4400000000005
but yeah

6519.679 --> 6524.159
good luck with that when you face

6521.44 --> 6524.159
something real

6525.199 --> 6531.5199999999995
right yeah but that was it was annoying

6527.679 --> 6531.52
like i don't think i did anything wrong

6532.719 --> 6535.92
i don't think i said anything wrong

6534.239 --> 6537.36
nathan didn't like it though because he

6535.92 --> 6540.8
doesn't like it when i get

6537.36 --> 6543.679
really sharp tongued on his show

6540.8 --> 6544.2390000000005
towards anyone pretty much because it

6543.679 --> 6548.2390000000005
robs

6544.239 --> 6551.919999999999
people the wrong way thing is though

6548.239 --> 6554.799999999999
i don't give a [ __ ]

6551.92 --> 6556.4800000000005
because when it's meant to be and i say

6554.8 --> 6559.76
it exactly how it is

6556.48 --> 6563.04
in that time then it's meant to be

6559.76 --> 6564.159000000001
and i'm not really yeah i don't really

6563.04 --> 6567.679
care too much about

6564.159 --> 6568.0
optics as they call it in that sense

6567.679 --> 6571.679
like

6568.0 --> 6575.36
social platform optics i'm just

6571.679 --> 6577.4400000000005
gonna be i'm gonna be me as it is

6575.36 --> 6578.96
and that's gonna ruffle some feathers

6577.44 --> 6580.839999999999
good

6578.96 --> 6582.4
people need to have their feathers

6580.84 --> 6586.2390000000005
ruffled

6582.4 --> 6586.239
because otherwise they get all dusty

6594.4 --> 6598.719
have you ever met nathan in person yes i

6596.4 --> 6598.719
have

6602.0 --> 6605.28
yes i have during the amsterdam

6603.52 --> 6607.84
conference he actually brought me

6605.28 --> 6609.759999999999
ranty's camera back then in 2019

6607.84 --> 6613.4400000000005
december

6609.76 --> 6613.4400000000005
is he the same person as

6613.84 --> 6620.8
as online well you might be surprised

6618.239 --> 6624.08
but he actually has a french accent in

6620.8 --> 6626.0
the real world

6624.08 --> 6627.36
pretty remarkable how he manages to

6626.0 --> 6629.52
uphold his english

6627.36 --> 6630.4
accent as well as he does completely

6629.52 --> 6635.360000000001
with

6630.4 --> 6638.96
the whole range of details of that

6635.36 --> 6641.759999999999
i'm just kidding man it's a belated

6638.96 --> 6643.599
april fool's joke no no nathan is

6641.76 --> 6653.84
exactly who he is on

6643.599 --> 6653.84
online completely

6654.159 --> 6658.08
and he's a really laid back guy he's

6656.639 --> 6661.679
very easy going

6658.08 --> 6662.8
very smooth as in you don't you can't

6661.679 --> 6664.88
trigger nathan

6662.8 --> 6666.8
you really can't you you got to get

6664.88 --> 6670.0
through some thick skin

6666.8 --> 6670.719
but he's also very perceptive and he's

6670.0 --> 6673.84
just

6670.719 --> 6677.199
a careful guy who takes things

6673.84 --> 6679.360000000001
seriously takes he has a size up meter

6677.199 --> 6681.28
for the spirit level and for how much

6679.36 --> 6682.0
energy somebody has to contain as it

6681.28 --> 6684.88
were he has

6682.0 --> 6684.88
a lot of senses

6686.96 --> 6694.2390000000005
and he's sharp and i like him

6690.08 --> 6696.4
nathan nathan oakley is ace
