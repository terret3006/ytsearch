59.8 --> 64.0
right

60.6 --> 65.68
good morning welcome to Flat Earth early

64.0 --> 69.04
bird number

65.68 --> 70.68
1731 I'm your host Arwin and before I

that'll be much appreciate it and really

91.92 --> 94.159
need

95.36 --> 100.72
it and uh yeah so I would really like to

98.52 --> 104.28
see some support

100.72 --> 105.96
again that would be great otherwise I

104.28 --> 110.52
might get very

105.96 --> 110.52
complainy anyway weather today

111.84 --> 120.479
is it was a bit clear skyed and then

117.039 --> 122.24
this went over so it's yeah

120.479 --> 124.479
kind of the same as yesterday there's

122.24 --> 126.96
less wind this really stands out there's

124.479 --> 126.96
less wind

127.8 --> 133.76
I'm not getting uh my doors blown shut

131.319 --> 133.76
and all

134.44 --> 140.12
that mint plant is crushing it

141.4 --> 147.68
still it's like it doesn't care whether

144.0 --> 147.68
the summer is over it just keeps

147.8 --> 152.92000000000002
going and the rest is also the fine my

150.68 --> 155.239
rosemary bush is actually doing pretty

152.92 --> 157.79999999999998
good and it's still

155.239 --> 160.04
blooming but it seems like it's doing

157.8 --> 163.76000000000002
better than before where it had like a

160.04 --> 166.0
lot of leaves that came yellow doesn't

163.76 --> 169.159
seem to do that now so maybe it's even

166.0 --> 171.959
doing better with a little less hot

169.159 --> 176.04
heat right anyway hello Richard G first

171.959 --> 179.4
in chat good to see

176.04 --> 181.04
you I'm starting late today so it's

179.4 --> 184.64000000000001
going to be a very short

181.04 --> 188.159
show hour 20 minutes

184.64 --> 190.879
roughly but uh yeah could not be helped

188.159 --> 190.879
sorry about

196.04 --> 199.48
that right

200.159 --> 203.76
so how are you all

204.56 --> 210.68
doing I'm doing

208.08 --> 213.08
great I'm just

210.68 --> 215.239
like almost at the point where I'm like

213.08 --> 217.28
yeah I'm just going to work on my game

215.239 --> 221.08
and I don't have time for the

217.28 --> 224.28
show like I worked on that like a

221.08 --> 226.76000000000002
combined of like six to eight hours

224.28 --> 229.439
yesterday I just wouldn't stop I just

226.76 --> 231.35999999999999
kept going like even in the middle of

229.439 --> 234.92
the night even during Owen Benjamin show

231.36 --> 234.92000000000002
I just kept going I just couldn't

235.439 --> 241.68
stop and like it's really making

238.68 --> 241.68
progress

242.4 --> 247.959
and it's not the final version yet but

244.76 --> 253.76
it's like it's all getting

247.959 --> 256.799
defined and soon I will like make a a a

253.76 --> 260.759
pure a pure chart that will like

256.799 --> 263.35999999999996
literally have every every conceivable

260.759 --> 266.28000000000003
thing that is possible within the game

263.36 --> 269.16
like every single op option in The

266.28 --> 271.59999999999997
Matrix so that nothing unexpected can

269.16 --> 271.6
ever happen

275.88 --> 281.68
happen and uh yeah I'm just really into

286.44 --> 294.71999999999997
it and I'm getting like other idea like

289.84 --> 294.71999999999997
I'm what I'm having is mostly a lot of

295.12 --> 301.12
reclassification it's like what is this

298.08 --> 302.919
and then if it is a addressed what is it

301.12 --> 304.68
going to address on it's going to

302.919 --> 308.919
address on

304.68 --> 308.919
traits how how does that

312.6 --> 320.8
work right so either the traits all have

315.96 --> 324.28
to be absolutely uniform and like not

320.8 --> 327.479
able to get in each other's way that one

324.28 --> 329.84
ability will not like cross

327.479 --> 333.31899999999996
over that two different different

329.84 --> 336.919
abilities can be marked on one thing and

333.319 --> 336.91900000000004
that that would self-contradictory

359.52 --> 363.75899999999996
everything was just on on paper I had to

362.0 --> 365.759
organize it in my mind as I was going to

363.759 --> 367.91900000000004
roll it out and that's the way it is

365.759 --> 369.08000000000004
then and if you add things on it becomes

367.919 --> 372.479
a

369.08 --> 374.44
mess the computer that's just no more

372.479 --> 377.039
problem at all it's just like oh

374.44 --> 381.0
reclassification okay copy this entire

377.039 --> 383.88
thing put it over there or cut it out

381.0 --> 386.8
put put it over there just move it

383.88 --> 388.4
around the whole thing it's brilliant

386.8 --> 391.40000000000003
loving

388.4 --> 391.4
it

391.479 --> 398.44
I didn't have that available to me back

394.44 --> 402.919
then when I was still like working on my

398.44 --> 402.919
Amiga and like on early

406.84 --> 413.479
PCS but probably there was already

410.08 --> 414.71999999999997
like word with like word organizer

413.479 --> 417.24
whatever but I

414.72 --> 420.36
didn't I was just very fresh to

417.24 --> 422.319
computers back then and and was not too

420.36 --> 424.0
eager to like oh let's get to know all

422.319 --> 425.52000000000004
these programs no because they gave me

424.0 --> 427.84
all a

425.52 --> 429.75899999999996
headache right but I've gotten a lot of

427.84 --> 434.0
time to get used to all of

429.759 --> 437.759
that and as s to the next level comes to

434.0 --> 437.759
computers and now I'm using

439.479 --> 446.08
it right I'd love to actually show you

443.36 --> 446.08000000000004
some of this

448.319 --> 453.16
progress

450.639 --> 454.68
just to give you a bit of a look as to

453.16 --> 457.96000000000004
what that looks

454.68 --> 457.96
like what is

458.52 --> 465.12
it all right let's see if this oh Jesus

461.479 --> 465.12
this like takes on the entire

465.159 --> 470.199
screen all

466.96 --> 472.159
right right so yeah I'm just going to

470.199 --> 474.759
show

472.159 --> 477.56
you it's not going to reveal too much

474.759 --> 480.84000000000003
but just just so you know like what what

477.56 --> 483.8
it looks like what I'm working on

480.84 --> 487.31899999999996
right so this is just

483.8 --> 490.639
T this this is what I've been making so

487.319 --> 490.639
far from

490.96 --> 496.35999999999996
nothing I'll have to write it

493.68 --> 500.28000000000003
down right and yeah if you thought that

496.36 --> 504.12
oh well that's not too much

500.28 --> 506.35999999999996
well some blocks are pretty freaking

504.12 --> 510.759
compact like for example let's check

506.36 --> 513.039
Bowlers or falling Bowlers to me more

510.759 --> 515.159
specific and then you got like this

513.039 --> 518.279
block of

515.159 --> 519.919
text that's how this looks like so

518.279 --> 521.68
everywhere there's a check there's a

519.919 --> 523.4789999999999
huge block of text where I've already

521.68 --> 524.64
filled it I haven't filled everything in

523.479 --> 530.2
just

524.64 --> 530.1999999999999
yet but I mean some things are

530.32 --> 536.399
vast and the unique properties list here

533.0 --> 539.279
that's just describing it's mostly just

536.399 --> 542.24
describing what is what it is supposed

539.279 --> 545.2
to be representing right so but here for

542.24 --> 548.279
example just water just

545.2 --> 551.0400000000001
water right but I am actually I'm

548.279 --> 553.36
already planning to like reorganize it

551.04 --> 553.36
all

555.2 --> 561.12
again and actually this is crazy make

558.72 --> 561.12
two

561.399 --> 566.24
layers something that would have been

563.959 --> 568.64
completely unheard of back in the day

566.24 --> 571.92
when I was starting all this but that

568.64 --> 571.92
should be possible

575.8 --> 581.0
now like because if I don't then I have

578.76 --> 584.36
to literally multiply all these

581.0 --> 587.0
different fluids with all boulders which

584.36 --> 589.5600000000001
is a classification now specifically

587.0 --> 593.8
Boulders are all things that

589.56 --> 596.959
are not fluids that are solid buers are

593.8 --> 600.4799999999999
all solid and they're all detached in

596.959 --> 601.959
the sense that they can all fall

600.48 --> 604.36
that makes them

601.959 --> 606.279
Boulders and but if they can fall it's

604.36 --> 607.839
because there's air that's surrounding

606.279 --> 609.88
them and they can just fall through it

607.839 --> 613.0790000000001
well if there's air surrounding it like

609.88 --> 617.36
all boulders are then that also means

613.079 --> 620.56
that fluids can go through them so if

617.36 --> 624.5600000000001
there's water above it it's going to

620.56 --> 626.8
flow past it but past it also means that

624.56 --> 629.64
it's basically surrounded by it and that

626.8 --> 634.399
also changes the properties

629.64 --> 637.16
cuz Boulders will fall slower in water

634.399 --> 639.16
they'll actually fall faster in vacuum

637.16 --> 640.76
yeah there's also a vacuum thing I mean

639.16 --> 643.48
this

640.76 --> 646.88
is this is

643.48 --> 646.88
epic vacuum

652.519 --> 658.48
generator just everything in here I can

655.399 --> 660.92
I already hear the sound effects in my

658.48 --> 664.72
head yeah

660.92 --> 668.5999999999999
here that's how much I'm into

664.72 --> 673.48
it hello dank good to see

668.6 --> 680.519
you it's kind of quiet today this

673.48 --> 680.519
Tuesday the 22nd of September 2003

681.16 --> 687.959
23

683.88 --> 690.32
2003 uh let's check the

687.959 --> 695.3599999999999
temperature temperature it's not too bad

690.32 --> 695.36
21° C it does feel like

696.12 --> 702.639
that yeah seems like it's going to be a

700.0 --> 703.56
decently decent temperature here around

702.639 --> 706.9590000000001
the

703.56 --> 709.1199999999999
20 coming week with some sun and a

706.959 --> 711.04
little bit of rain so it seems like a

709.12 --> 713.399
just nice

711.04 --> 715.88
weather all

713.399 --> 718.44
right and I'm really liking that it's

715.88 --> 720.8
not so windy because that just makes me

718.44 --> 722.9590000000001
very nervous nervous and

720.8 --> 725.68
distracted and that's not a good thing

722.959 --> 728.5189999999999
when you're trying to like work out

725.68 --> 728.519
these table

730.04 --> 736.36
things right but yeah

733.72 --> 739.639
progress I'm actually doing this and

736.36 --> 742.32
there's nothing like really blocking

739.639 --> 745.12
me but it is like development

742.32 --> 749.1600000000001
Redevelopment it's like I'm basically

745.12 --> 750.24
now organizing the entire engine because

749.16 --> 753.24
it is an

750.24 --> 756.519
engine it's a whole set of check

753.24 --> 759.92
routines that will always happen in the

756.519 --> 759.92
game once you

761.639 --> 769.48
initiate you have a field in the field

764.88 --> 773.279
are units those units all have specific

769.48 --> 776.48
check routines that they

773.279 --> 778.639
do then the scanner comes and one by one

776.48 --> 780.639
the blocks are all checked it's like

778.639 --> 782.16
this this one it's going to do what it's

780.639 --> 784.32
going to do it's going to check things

782.16 --> 787.36
might be changing things might be doing

784.32 --> 791.279
things and if

787.36 --> 793.5600000000001
not move on next check and then that

791.279 --> 795.68
one's going to do things depending on

793.56 --> 798.8389999999999
what it is and the environment whether

795.68 --> 800.519
it can do that Etc and and so it just

798.839 --> 803.6
keeps

800.519 --> 807.24
going right and blocks while it's their

803.6 --> 809.12
turn can in like they can turn other

807.24 --> 812.199
things on let's just say a block is a

809.12 --> 814.399
switch you activate it well from your

812.199 --> 816.399
position you're targeting the block the

814.399 --> 819.32
block is then

816.399 --> 822.079
getting transformed into a switched on

819.32 --> 823.9590000000001
switch that switch on switch is linked

822.079 --> 826.8389999999999
it has to be programmed by the level

823.959 --> 828.8389999999999
maker to activate another thing that's

826.839 --> 831.32
somewhere else specifically targeted

828.839 --> 837.24
that also switches on and that's even

831.32 --> 837.24
before the check routines like gets to

837.759 --> 840.759
it

843.8 --> 849.3199999999999
I think yeah unless there's like a delay

847.079 --> 852.88
you could technically program all kinds

849.32 --> 856.8000000000001
of delays like on switches like a switch

852.88 --> 860.759
that there's like a second or let's just

856.8 --> 864.279
say a few clicks a few scans of the

860.759 --> 866.519
entire level in between you can set

864.279 --> 869.16
these thing you can set the

866.519 --> 871.9590000000001
speeds like as a programmer I can like

869.16 --> 874.56
determine that and I can like give some

871.959 --> 877.68
room for level designers to basically

874.56 --> 879.279
set speeds to set the speed of the

877.68 --> 882.7589999999999
overall

879.279 --> 884.8
level that like this one needs to be a

882.759 --> 887.9590000000001
level where you're walking pretty slowly

884.8 --> 890.7589999999999
or this one needs to be a place where

887.959 --> 894.2399999999999
you can literally like walk way too fast

890.759 --> 896.8000000000001
like that could be a trait of the level

894.24 --> 899.399
of how the level experience is so I'm

896.8 --> 900.7589999999999
going to like just make it so that all

899.399 --> 903.8
these

900.759 --> 906.399
things like outside of the engine which

903.8 --> 909.4799999999999
is once it's in place nothing changes

906.399 --> 912.959
about the engine except maybe for like

909.48 --> 912.9590000000001
bugs or whatever or

913.04 --> 917.88
mistakes but things about it can be

915.839 --> 920.9200000000001
universally altered kind of like the old

917.88 --> 922.639
bashh construction kit you could change

920.92 --> 925.24
the colors and then if you change one

922.639 --> 928.88
colors then everything in the

925.24 --> 933.0
field their consecutive part changes to

928.88 --> 934.56
that new color and so yeah I don't know

933.0 --> 936.68
I don't know if any of you are listening

934.56 --> 940.68
to this at all maybe you're just really

936.68 --> 943.16
bored by this but I'm just like really

940.68 --> 946.279
into it right

943.16 --> 949.0
now just can't way to actually start

946.279 --> 951.759
testing it that would be so

949.0 --> 954.079
amazing but I got I got to have some

951.759 --> 957.0
like primitive Graphics together first

954.079 --> 958.7589999999999
though but I mean technically for the

957.0 --> 961.319
Primitive Graphics I could go with as

958.759 --> 963.319
far as to literally scan the paper

961.319 --> 966.92
drawings that I

963.319 --> 966.92
made and just

967.24 --> 973.04
like

969.0 --> 976.399
yeah or even turn it into a Photoshop

973.04 --> 980.319
square and then just pixel color it

976.399 --> 983.16
in just oldfashioned Graphics

980.319 --> 986.759
design and then just use that the point

983.16 --> 990.199
is is that I'll have something to use a

986.759 --> 993.0790000000001
block instead of a bunch of text that

990.199 --> 995.959
represents the unit so I can then use it

993.079 --> 998.7199999999999
in like demonstrations the Tes

995.959 --> 1000.5999999999999
things right so I'm going to need some

998.72 --> 1002.759
very basic Graphics before I can even

1000.6 --> 1004.9590000000001
start testing the game like I'm not

1002.759 --> 1008.839
going to test it by replacing all the

1004.959 --> 1012.88
blocks with just with asy letters or

1008.839 --> 1012.8800000000001
something like that's totally not

1017.48 --> 1020.48
doable

1025.72 --> 1031.959
wonderful day dank hello steamy traveler

1028.6 --> 1037.039
good to see you I missed fed yesterday

1031.959 --> 1037.039
fed yesterday yeah it was was about

1037.6 --> 1040.6
again

1042.36 --> 1050.9599999999998
[ __ ] what were I completely

1047.039 --> 1050.96
forgot what the hell what was it

1052.4 --> 1057.52
about yeah and oh when never like the

1055.679 --> 1061.3600000000001
live streams always have the title from

1057.52 --> 1061.36
the previous day which is really

1061.44 --> 1066.24
annoying let's see what the hell was it

1068.039 --> 1074.2
about

1070.96 --> 1075.799
[ __ ] yeah no that's absolutely the time

1074.2 --> 1080.4
I wanted in an

1075.799 --> 1080.4
ad [ __ ] ad

1083.919 --> 1089.96
oh two ads oh that's just [ __ ] great

1087.84 --> 1092.1589999999999
I just want to [ __ ] check what's

1089.96 --> 1092.159
going

1095.919 --> 1100.3200000000002
on is there a review of any

1104.48 --> 1110.28
kind

1107.32 --> 1114.48
angles yeah it was again

1110.28 --> 1117.12
about glober Celestial navigation versus

1114.48 --> 1119.919
actual Celestial navigation that was

1117.12 --> 1122.1589999999999
what it was about a

1119.919 --> 1123.5200000000002
lot but that was the live show I don't

1122.159 --> 1126.0
even remember what we talked about in

1123.52 --> 1126.0
the after

1126.799 --> 1131.4
show maybe Nathan will show up and tell

1131.76 --> 1139.64
us anyway yeah my finger like signif I

1135.44 --> 1141.8400000000001
can actually do this again but man my

1139.64 --> 1142.96
finger was swallowed up like a swallowed

1141.84 --> 1147.3999999999999
up like a

1142.96 --> 1151.559
soldier swollen up like a sausage what

1147.4 --> 1151.5590000000002
the [ __ ] is going on with my language

1152.64 --> 1157.5590000000002
system it was swolling up like a sausage

1155.4 --> 1160.52
and it could barely move it but now like

1157.559 --> 1162.28
I have sweated a lot this night so I

1160.52 --> 1164.799
think that that was probably directly

1162.28 --> 1167.799
because of this and it's a lot better

1164.799 --> 1169.08
now so I'm glad that didn't like get

1167.799 --> 1170.8799999999999
worse

1169.08 --> 1172.6
that today I would wake up and I would

1170.88 --> 1175.159
have like a finger that literally

1172.6 --> 1177.039
overlaps my other fingers or something

1175.159 --> 1178.7990000000002
and then I'd probably have to actually

1177.039 --> 1181.679
go to a

1178.799 --> 1184.0
doctor or at least call my dad but that

1181.679 --> 1184.0
didn't

1186.96 --> 1193.4
happen you ever heard someone call the

1189.88 --> 1196.44
second law a statistical law no I

1193.4 --> 1199.039
haven't not not yet vibr outs but I'm

1196.44 --> 1203.0800000000002
sure that will happen

1199.039 --> 1206.52
right any red herring any straw man

1203.08 --> 1208.6399999999999
any forced misinterpretation to to

1206.52 --> 1212.0
basically be able to bypass all the

1208.64 --> 1215.72
arguments that prove the Earth is not a

1212.0 --> 1219.64
globe yeah they'll call anything

1215.72 --> 1222.159
anything they'll completely rearrange

1219.64 --> 1224.76
how how language is even

1222.159 --> 1227.3200000000002
viewed just to be able to prove that the

1224.76 --> 1230.1589999999999
Earth is still a ball right they'll

1227.32 --> 1230.1589999999999
change language

1231.76 --> 1238.1589999999999
right they'll they prefer to change the

1234.84 --> 1238.1589999999999
meaning of the word

1238.559 --> 1242.8799999999999
prove just so they could still prove the

1241.24 --> 1245.36
Earth is a

1242.88 --> 1247.5590000000002
globe they wouldn't be able to actually

1245.36 --> 1252.6
prove it but they'd still be able to

1247.559 --> 1252.6
call it proving it because proving would

1252.64 --> 1257.48
be yeah would be repurposed into

1255.72 --> 1261.3600000000001
something else so that they could still

1257.48 --> 1264.28
use it like they'll go any length with

1261.36 --> 1266.6
this any lengths they will literally

1264.28 --> 1269.8799999999999
become completely verbally

1266.6 --> 1271.1999999999998
unintelligible if necessary to continue

1269.88 --> 1276.0800000000002
the globe

1271.2 --> 1276.0800000000002
religion they will literally become

1276.6 --> 1285.08
unintelligible if that could make them

1280.12 --> 1288.279
continue their Globe religion that will

1285.08 --> 1290.83
happen this is AR Winan prediction long

1288.279 --> 1292.919
term long-term

1290.83 --> 1295.9189999999999
[Music]

1292.919 --> 1295.919
prediction

1298.6 --> 1304.12
huh remember the video professor in the

1302.12 --> 1306.6
60s explaining the second

1304.12 --> 1310.36
law

1306.6 --> 1312.1999999999998
uh you mean the one the one where they

1310.36 --> 1314.7199999999998
do the Barium

1312.2 --> 1316.559
test yes i' certainly remember that one

1314.72 --> 1319.32
if that's the one you mean I don't

1316.559 --> 1322.52
remember any other

1319.32 --> 1328.3999999999999
professors from the 60s

1322.52 --> 1328.4
involving physics that were shown like

1329.4 --> 1335.4
that all

1331.72 --> 1339.0
right hello by the way aen Supreme

1335.4 --> 1339.0
knowing and fiber

1344.84 --> 1350.76
outs got Illuminati C on here and I'm

1347.799 --> 1353.4
going take a bite out of it cuz I'm

1350.76 --> 1353.4
really freaking

1357.61 --> 1363.569
[Music]

1376.96 --> 1379.96
hungry

1391.24 --> 1394.6
hey Dr utar good to see

1402.559 --> 1406.799
you oh okay FIB

1406.88 --> 1409.88
yeah

1414.559 --> 1423.12
well you could call that yeah maximum

1417.96 --> 1423.1200000000001
probability there is a a Quantum aspect

1427.279 --> 1433.48
involved show you started uh I started

1430.64 --> 1436.48
very late today Dr udar it's going to be

1433.48 --> 1436.48
a short show

1436.88 --> 1442.48
sorry but I mean fibbr outs yeah

1439.64 --> 1445.48
somebody they could call it statistical

1442.48 --> 1445.48
but it doesn't really

1446.52 --> 1451.799
matter

1448.32 --> 1452.96
because it's like the point about it is

1451.799 --> 1455.44
that it's

1452.96 --> 1459.8400000000001
inevitable it's not like a

1455.44 --> 1461.96
chance it's always like if time or the

1459.84 --> 1466.799
the passing of time

1461.96 --> 1469.799
continues entropy will always become

1466.799 --> 1469.799
maximized

1495.279 --> 1500.559
yeah and I don't know who where that on

1498.039 --> 1503.52
the average that doesn't make any sense

1500.559 --> 1506.0
now the point is is that there's no

1503.52 --> 1507.6399999999999
exception it's not on average because

1506.0 --> 1510.559
that means that there would be

1507.64 --> 1514.159
exceptions the point is is there is no

1510.559 --> 1514.1589999999999
exception it always

1518.559 --> 1521.559
happens

1526.679 --> 1531.3990000000001
right

1529.08 --> 1535.32
trying to learn I don't know fiber oats

1531.399 --> 1538.2399999999998
but whoever used those words they were

1535.32 --> 1541.039
incorrect it's not a maximum probability

1538.24 --> 1545.32
it's not on the average it's

1541.039 --> 1548.559
always it's never not

1545.32 --> 1550.6
always so it's just wrong if they use

1548.559 --> 1554.0
those words in relation to the second

1550.6 --> 1556.6399999999999
law thermodynamics it's always it's very

1554.0 --> 1558.36
specifically highlighted word in the

1556.64 --> 1562.3990000000001
second law it's

1558.36 --> 1565.1999999999998
always not on average not sometimes not

1562.399 --> 1568.35
a lot of chance it's always always

1565.2 --> 1571.45
always never

1568.35 --> 1571.4499999999998
[Music]

1586.6 --> 1589.6
not

1609.6 --> 1615.1999999999998
uh yeah metal stucks coil hello by the

1612.6 --> 1615.1999999999998
way

1616.12 --> 1621.36
sure I don't know know why but you were

1618.559 --> 1623.399
on the freaking band list too I don't

1621.36 --> 1626.7199999999998
get

1623.399 --> 1629.039
it I don't remember him ever doing

1626.72 --> 1631.76
anything wrong I'm giving you a wrench

1629.039 --> 1631.76
just to protect

1632.32 --> 1637.8799999999999
you it's so weird man like all these

1635.44 --> 1640.48
people that actually do show up in my

1637.88 --> 1643.6000000000001
chat they all get banned by somebody

1640.48 --> 1646.52
else some [ __ ] scumbag is just

1643.6 --> 1649.52
[ __ ] with my

1646.52 --> 1649.52
channel

1657.559 --> 1663.6
yeah I'm not going to watch that fiber

1660.72 --> 1665.96
outs I'm in a show I don't got I'm not

1663.6 --> 1670.9189999999999
don't watch

1665.96 --> 1670.919
videos with sound during my live

1675.36 --> 1680.6399999999999
show I guess other other people could

1678.039 --> 1680.64
take a look

1688.64 --> 1691.8490000000002

1700.07 --> 1703.3899999999999
[Music]

1706.44 --> 1709.44
whatever

1719.08 --> 1724.6789999999999
but I mean you could compare it

1721.36 --> 1728.1999999999998
to Rolling dice

1724.679 --> 1729.76
right so you have a standard dice one

1728.2 --> 1732.6000000000001
and one to

1729.76 --> 1736.399
six if you throw it once there's a one

1732.6 --> 1738.84
in six chance to you roll the

1736.399 --> 1744.279
six

1738.84 --> 1748.6789999999999
if you roll it a 100 times there's 100%

1744.279 --> 1748.679
chance you're going to roll at least one

1752.88 --> 1760.72
six what the

1755.6 --> 1765.76
hell I'm getting my an Israeli flag

1760.72 --> 1765.76
thingy but thanks Dr

1766.32 --> 1769.32
utar

1779.6 --> 1786.9599999999998
oh okay well metal STS uh Nathan Oakley

1783.159 --> 1786.96
is definitely not Banning

1789.36 --> 1796.08
people it's not happening on screen what

1793.24 --> 1799.48
you really think that Nathan is secretly

1796.08 --> 1803.6789999999999
coming to my show to

1799.48 --> 1803.679
block my viewers

1803.72 --> 1808.0
really that's the most [ __ ] theory

1806.6 --> 1812.12
that I've ever

1808.0 --> 1812.12
heard and I've heard quite a

1817.64 --> 1822.88
few can't find Illuminati yeah because

1820.36 --> 1822.8799999999999
it isn't

1826.24 --> 1829.24
there

1838.0 --> 1843.88
whatever is going on it has nothing to

1839.76 --> 1846.919
do with people showing up in my chat

1843.88 --> 1849.24
because it wasn't chat activity based

1846.919 --> 1852.6000000000001
yeah everybody that got supposedly

1849.24 --> 1856.039
banned all of a sudden it never

1852.6 --> 1859.24
showed it never showed once in the chat

1856.039 --> 1859.24
when that happened

1860.32 --> 1867.24
right so steamy traveler Theory might be

1864.88 --> 1869.5590000000002
correct and somebody found a trick to

1867.24 --> 1872.2
basically go into other

1869.559 --> 1876.279
chats other live chats from previous

1872.2 --> 1876.279
shows and then ban people

1878.919 --> 1883.76
there but that only works if they have

1881.6 --> 1886.399
no

1883.76 --> 1889.1589999999999
wrenches but I mean why the [ __ ] would

1886.399 --> 1889.1589999999999
Nathan do that

1897.639 --> 1904.6789999999999
could me remember me

1900.6 --> 1906.7199999999998
no I remember you but you have been

1904.679 --> 1908.519
apparently banned for quite a while on

1906.72 --> 1910.3990000000001
my channel I don't know if I kicked you

1908.519 --> 1913.1200000000001
out because you were acting like an ass

1910.399 --> 1915.0
or giving me lip when I was pissed off

1913.12 --> 1917.8799999999999
that could very well

1915.0 --> 1921.08
be but you're not banned right now now

1917.88 --> 1921.0800000000002
let's try to keep it that

1921.72 --> 1927.279
way yeah the guy unbanning himself yeah

1924.48 --> 1927.279
that was [ __ ]

1940.559 --> 1945.1589999999999
insane yeah yeah that was just

1943.32 --> 1948.24
completely

1945.159 --> 1951.44
freaky but I mean yoube is bound to like

1948.24 --> 1951.44
take notice of that

1976.039 --> 1979.039
[ __ ]

1980.76 --> 1985.1589999999999
but

1981.76 --> 1986.919
anyway I should still feel very very

1985.159 --> 1991.72
lucky that I'm part of

1986.919 --> 1994.2

1991.72 --> 1997.6390000000001
really bad it was already pretty bad

1994.2 --> 2000.3990000000001
it's getting worse getting more evil

1997.639 --> 2002.8799999999999
more suppressive more

2000.399 --> 2005.279
manipulative more

2002.88 --> 2008.279
fanatical it's not going to take long

2005.279 --> 2010.679
before literally people that speak out

2008.279 --> 2012.76
against climate change things are going

2010.679 --> 2016.3990000000001
to get banned for it it's not going to

2012.76 --> 2016.399
take long guys it's going to

2028.35 --> 2032.4399999999998
[Music]

2030.24 --> 2035.24
happen so I don't

2032.44 --> 2037.6000000000001
know if they keep this up there's a good

2035.24 --> 2042.84
chance that YouTube is just going to be

2037.6 --> 2042.84
completely shut down or like even

2047.879 --> 2051.52
broken cuz they're certainly not doing

2050.72 --> 2055.0789999999997
their

2051.52 --> 2057.639
best to be a good platform they're

2055.079 --> 2059.3590000000004
certainly not doing their best for that

2057.639 --> 2061.48
they're mostly doing their best to

2059.359 --> 2064.0
accommodate

2061.48 --> 2068.879
for the liberal

2064.0 --> 2068.879
Imperium and they increasing insanity

2069.2 --> 2073.0
that's their priority that's YouTube's

2078.919 --> 2086.1189999999997
priority so yeah I don't

2082.52 --> 2089.24
know I mean I I it might not really

2086.119 --> 2093.44
happen totally but there could be like a

2089.24 --> 2093.4399999999996
like a complete and total

2094.8 --> 2098.8790000000004
Exodus somewhere in the near future

2099.079 --> 2103.4
where YouTube's literally going to be

2100.88 --> 2106.2400000000002
completely shut down and yeah that means

2103.4 --> 2108.04
like 100 billion videos that will

2106.24 --> 2113.2799999999997
literally

2108.04 --> 2113.2799999999997
suddenly just be gone it will all be

2113.68 --> 2118.0
erased including everything I made

2122.76 --> 2127.92
mostly now maybe some of that will be

2125.8 --> 2130.2000000000003
retained

2127.92 --> 2135.64
I got like I still my Channel's still

2130.2 --> 2137.72
being like autoc copied to uh to Odyssey

2135.64 --> 2140.1189999999997
if I'm not mistaken let me actually

2137.72 --> 2140.1189999999997
check

2148.0 --> 2151.839
that where the hell is

2155.8 --> 2158.8
it

2171.28 --> 2174.2400000000002
where the [ __ ] is the

2185.72 --> 2188.72
link

2193.04 --> 2197.16
I what is going

2197.4 --> 2202.2000000000003
on why the [ __ ] don't I even have a

2203.28 --> 2206.349
[Music]

2215.68 --> 2218.68
link

2223.72 --> 2227.5989999999997
where is the aicy

2232.4 --> 2241.2400000000002
platform oh wait here it is a damn

2236.319 --> 2244.44
it didn't say Odyssey stupid

2241.24 --> 2244.4399999999996
idiot all

2245.599 --> 2249.48
right

2247.599 --> 2252.04
Super Bowl yeah it's still it's still

2249.48 --> 2254.839
uploading not everything apparently but

2252.04 --> 2258.56
it's uploading

2254.839 --> 2260.64
still so yeah even if YouTube does that

2258.56 --> 2264.2
the majority of my streams will still be

2260.64 --> 2264.2
retained so that's

2275.599 --> 2281.599
good yeah Supreme yeah how about let's

2279.4 --> 2285.4
not no well I could get into yeah

2281.599 --> 2287.6400000000003
climate change is the worst [ __ ]

2285.4 --> 2291.64
nonsense

2287.64 --> 2295.04
ever it is like on the level of just

2291.64 --> 2296.2799999999997
evil Shaman going AAA with a bunch of

2295.04 --> 2299.079
sticks with

2296.28 --> 2301.3590000000004
fire to say that some evil spirit is

2299.079 --> 2303.319
coming is going to eat them all and they

2301.359 --> 2304.16
going to be disasters and the volcano is

2303.319 --> 2307.2799999999997
going to

2304.16 --> 2308.24
erupt it's literally that that's what

2307.28 --> 2311.3190000000004
it's

2308.24 --> 2313.5989999999997
become it's the level of intellect that

2311.319 --> 2317.44
backs the entire

2313.599 --> 2319.8
idea it is complete and utter

2317.44 --> 2321.16
nonsense always was but it's just

2319.8 --> 2325.599
becoming

2321.16 --> 2329.2799999999997
really really understood now how much of

2325.599 --> 2331.44
a complete [ __ ] it always was

2329.28 --> 2334.6400000000003
everything about it is [ __ ]

2331.44 --> 2339.4
everything about the entire idea is

2334.64 --> 2339.4
[ __ ] the model preface is

2340.52 --> 2345.119
[ __ ] just the model is completely

2343.16 --> 2349.16
wrong that they even

2345.119 --> 2351.56
use and then well of course every time

2349.16 --> 2354.8799999999997
they make a prediction they always get

2351.56 --> 2358.68
it wrong have you ever heard and I mean

2354.88 --> 2362.4
in the last two 300 years or something

2358.68 --> 2365.04
if you ever heard one single climate

2362.4 --> 2367.0
change global warming Global freezing

2365.04 --> 2369.0
whatever related

2367.0 --> 2370.839
claim that came

2369.0 --> 2372.92
true

2370.839 --> 2376.2799999999997
one just

2372.92 --> 2380.599
one that came true no there is zero

2376.28 --> 2384.92
there's zero claims that came true zero

2380.599 --> 2388.319
and there will forever be zero claims

2384.92 --> 2392.52
coming true relating to climate change

2388.319 --> 2392.52
Zero claims will come

2395.4 --> 2398.4
true

2425.359 --> 2428.359
for

2439.52 --> 2446.44
ice cor yeah that's hor [ __ ] the ice cor

2443.319 --> 2449.44
samples prove them wrong it proves them

2446.44 --> 2452.2000000000003
wrong with everything every sample every

2449.44 --> 2454.44
test every claim every prediction

2452.2 --> 2456.839
everything ever related to [ __ ]

2454.44 --> 2459.599
climate change has all

2456.839 --> 2462.96
always been

2459.599 --> 2465.6800000000003
wrong every single [ __ ] related thing

2462.96 --> 2468.92
to it has always been

2465.68 --> 2471.999
wrong there's no

2468.92 --> 2471.9990000000003
[Music]

2485.24 --> 2488.24
exception

2492.1 --> 2504.239
[Music]

2509.94 --> 2518.2400000000002
[Music]

2515.24 --> 2518.24
ooh

2545.1 --> 2548.23
[Music]

2561.0 --> 2565.8
yeah okay this is good enough I got a

2563.52 --> 2565.8
little

2566.16 --> 2572.92
title let's

2568.8 --> 2576.4
see if I get into trouble for

2572.92 --> 2578.04
it probably not I mean I just I'm

2576.4 --> 2580.359
predicting they're going to like go

2578.04 --> 2581.7599999999998
censorship [ __ ] on climate change

2580.359 --> 2586.24
related

2581.76 --> 2588.6800000000003
stuff but it's not happening right

2586.24 --> 2591.319
now I'm just saying they did it with the

2588.68 --> 2595.04
whole coid [ __ ] and it's been it stopped

2591.319 --> 2598.8
though right you can now just say Co

2595.04 --> 2600.92
talk about just don't bring any origins

2598.8 --> 2602.7200000000003
of it right because that's all

2600.92 --> 2604.92
copyrighted

2602.72 --> 2606.8799999999997
trademark

2604.92 --> 2609.2000000000003
narrative right that the liberal

2606.88 --> 2612.8
Imperium cracks down on so don't get

2609.2 --> 2615.2
involved in the clearly constructed

2612.8 --> 2617.6800000000003
narratives but you can definitely just

2615.2 --> 2620.9199999999996
say it you can just say vaccines you can

2617.68 --> 2622.2799999999997
say don't take the vaccine you can say

2620.92 --> 2626.96
CO's

2622.28 --> 2630.3190000000004
fake whatever I don't believe it

2626.96 --> 2633.16
exists it's not a problem

2630.319 --> 2635.24
anymore but when they did that well that

2633.16 --> 2637.0
means they could do that with climate

2635.24 --> 2640.64
change related stuff stuff

2637.0 --> 2642.92
too and start censoring people over that

2640.64 --> 2647.68
but right now that's not the case yet so

2642.92 --> 2651.04
I am making full opportunity making full

2647.68 --> 2654.64
effort taking the opportunity to to just

2651.04 --> 2654.64
pump that out while I still

2662.68 --> 2670.5989999999997
can climate you have the worst idea of

2665.68 --> 2675.24
metal lik CA no that's a terrible title

2670.599 --> 2676.599
idea yeah this is not a [ __ ] gay club

2675.24 --> 2680.1189999999997
metal slugs

2676.599 --> 2682.2400000000002
cockail yeah this is not mug club or

2680.119 --> 2685.7200000000003
something shitty like

2682.24 --> 2690.52
that yeah with Arwin and friends I will

2685.72 --> 2693.319
never put Arwin and friends in my title

2690.52 --> 2693.319
okay

2694.96 --> 2697.96
ever

2704.92 --> 2708.88
you were kidding okay

2710.96 --> 2715.44
good sometimes it's not

2720.4 --> 2726.4
yeah so yeah all predictions ever made

2723.96 --> 2728.119
about climate change have always always

2726.4 --> 2732.28
been

2728.119 --> 2734.1600000000003
wrong and that's a fact like that's a

2732.28 --> 2737.6800000000003
statistical

2734.16 --> 2738.96
fact if you'd like to prove me wrong and

2737.68 --> 2742.16
I mean

2738.96 --> 2745.16
anybody including some fanatical climate

2742.16 --> 2749.2
change numpty [ __ ] idiot in

2745.16 --> 2752.7999999999997
government or whatever prove me wrong

2749.2 --> 2754.8799999999997
yeah give me one example of a climate

2752.8 --> 2756.599
change related

2754.88 --> 2761.2400000000002
issue

2756.599 --> 2763.96
and I mean in history all of it but

2761.24 --> 2765.4399999999996
let's just go back like 50 years yeah

2763.96 --> 2767.839
there have been plenty predictions made

2765.44 --> 2770.839
there's been a movie made by El Gore and

2767.839 --> 2773.16
all that [ __ ] yeah show me one

2770.839 --> 2774.44
prediction related to climate change

2773.16 --> 2779.359
that came

2774.44 --> 2781.44
true one zero and that includes the ones

2779.359 --> 2784.96
that were just being alarmist and nobody

2781.44 --> 2787.8
gave a [ __ ] yeah those did not come true

2784.96 --> 2787.8
either

2788.72 --> 2794.4399999999996
right now it's still not coming true

2791.72 --> 2795.4399999999996
despite people being stupid enough to

2794.44 --> 2799.2400000000002
make

2795.44 --> 2799.2400000000002
attempts to go with

2800.48 --> 2804.76
it manm Pig yeah yeah

2814.8 --> 2820.2400000000002
yeah

2817.72 --> 2822.48
still have man located man bear pig well

2820.24 --> 2824.52
I think that there the the chances that

2822.48 --> 2826.16
manbear pig

2824.52 --> 2832.0
exists

2826.16 --> 2838.92
are like a 100 times more likely than

2832.0 --> 2838.92
that man changes climate through

2840.28 --> 2846.3190000000004
industry I think there the chances of

2842.72 --> 2848.9599999999996
man bear pig existing are like

2846.319 --> 2852.119
what is it a quarter of that of

2848.96 --> 2854.7200000000003
Bigfoot but it's still like infinitely

2852.119 --> 2858.4
more likely that there is an actual man

2854.72 --> 2861.5989999999997
bear pig then that people can

2858.4 --> 2863.52
influence the climate with their

2861.599 --> 2867.2400000000002
industry

2863.52 --> 2867.24
yeah I'm being quite

2874.72 --> 2877.72
literal

2884.04 --> 2894.24
bro if you can't even change the climate

2889.48 --> 2895.72
in World War I and 2 when everything is

2894.24 --> 2899.5589999999997
trashed

2895.72 --> 2899.5589999999997
explosions chemical

2899.64 --> 2908.0
warfare and just horrendous conditions

2903.599 --> 2911.599
and demoralization and like starvation

2908.0 --> 2914.079
and well did I mention things blowing up

2911.599 --> 2920.6800000000003
entire cities being bombed and torched

2914.079 --> 2922.52
and [ __ ] like yeah guess what that had

2920.68 --> 2926.9199999999996
zero

2922.52 --> 2928.92
zero influence on the climate yeah zero

2926.92 --> 2932.48
things changed

2928.92 --> 2935.799
before and after zero change yeah there

2932.48 --> 2938.559
was some situation at the time and it

2935.799 --> 2942.319
was [ __ ] up and it's poison and [ __ ]

2938.559 --> 2947.2400000000002
yeah and burning and cold days and

2942.319 --> 2950.5589999999997
whatever the point is nothing

2947.24 --> 2954.68
changed soon as the situation died down

2950.559 --> 2958.3190000000004
again guess what everything was exactly

2954.68 --> 2962.2
the same as it was before despite a

2958.319 --> 2967.52
freaking world war with massive

2962.2 --> 2967.52
explosions and [ __ ] and burning cities

2967.64 --> 2972.0
yeah zero

2972.68 --> 2977.7599999999998
influence yeah if climate change could

2975.4 --> 2981.319
destroy us then the world would have

2977.76 --> 2981.3190000000004
ended in like

2984.24 --> 2987.4399999999996
1920 it

2994.52 --> 2997.52
didn't

2998.799 --> 3006.44
sopr know cut down a tree is a problem

3001.4 --> 3006.44
no not really you see trees grow

3008.96 --> 3015.799
back the problem is is if you're going

3011.28 --> 3020.2000000000003
to use wild resources and then overuse

3015.799 --> 3023.28
them like if you don't get give a

3020.2 --> 3025.96
place time to

3023.28 --> 3027.96
recover then you yeah well then you

3025.96 --> 3029.76
literally just change the landscape

3027.96 --> 3031.359
that's going to have an influence on the

3029.76 --> 3034.88
weather yeah if you cut down all the

3031.359 --> 3039.68
trees then suddenly more wind all yeah

3034.88 --> 3042.2400000000002
that but that's not because of gases or

3039.68 --> 3047.24
whatever yeah that's because you

3042.24 --> 3047.24
literally like well destroyed the

3047.52 --> 3053.16
landscape yeah that that's going to have

3049.839 --> 3058.0789999999997
a a local influence or guess

3053.16 --> 3058.96
what local yeah that influences where

3058.079 --> 3061.6400000000003
it's

3058.96 --> 3063.839
changed yeah it does influence

3061.64 --> 3067.839
everything that surrounds that the

3063.839 --> 3072.48
entire a no no nothing is influenced

3067.839 --> 3075.16
yeah man can't influence [ __ ] about the

3072.48 --> 3078.799
environment yeah you can influence your

3075.16 --> 3082.2
local environment with whatever you're

3078.799 --> 3086.319
doing that will not change anything in

3082.2 --> 3091.5589999999997
the entire world except your local area

3086.319 --> 3091.5589999999997
that you're changing influencing that's

3091.88 --> 3099.319
it yeah you want to see the the world

3095.599 --> 3102.44
green again start producing more

3099.319 --> 3105.96
CO2 yeah you know

3102.44 --> 3108.52
how like industrialists or

3105.96 --> 3113.04
environmentalists like if they would

3108.52 --> 3116.4
like turn something into like a a a

3113.04 --> 3118.079
nature place you know what they do

3116.4 --> 3121.2000000000003
like and I knew this in the freaking

3118.079 --> 3124.52
'90s yeah you know what they do they

3121.2 --> 3126.16
install CO2

3124.52 --> 3130.88
pumps

3126.16 --> 3135.1189999999997
yeah CO2 pumps pump out CO2 guess what

3130.88 --> 3137.079
happens plants plants grow like crazy

3135.119 --> 3139.079
when even before they wouldn't have been

3137.079 --> 3141.6400000000003
able to grow suddenly they're able to

3139.079 --> 3145.04
grow there yeah that's how suddenly

3141.64 --> 3148.2
grass starts growing in the middle of

3145.04 --> 3150.88
the Sahara Desert or not in the middle

3148.2 --> 3154.359
of it but like at the South it just

3150.88 --> 3159.2400000000002
suddenly starts to become grass yeah why

3154.359 --> 3159.24
why yeah because of CO2 because of

3159.88 --> 3164.2000000000003
Industry that pumps it out there because

3162.4 --> 3165.599
they don't give a [ __ ] about [ __ ]

climate change

3165.599 --> 3171.96

3169.799 --> 3175.92
guess what everything becomes

3171.96 --> 3178.2400000000002
green because climate change Co 2

3175.92 --> 3183.48
limitation is

3178.24 --> 3186.72
satanic it literally kills life to limit

3183.48 --> 3189.599
CO2 it kills

3186.72 --> 3192.48
life all life plant

3189.599 --> 3194.96
life and thus human life depending on

4145.12 --> 4150.679
yeah everybody's healthy and free enough

4147.239 --> 4154.5199999999995
yeah right so that means that everything

4150.679 --> 4156.92
has to be destroyed then because well

4154.52 --> 4158.64
Zep tapier is just fine with all of it

4156.92 --> 4161.759
right he's still healthy his family is

4158.64 --> 4164.6
still healthy so he thinks so yeah that

4161.759 --> 4168.96
nothing will happen so I guess it has to

4164.6 --> 4172.1990000000005
be destroyed then because nobody ever

4168.96 --> 4175.279
[ __ ] does anything until everything

4172.199 --> 4178.5599999999995
taken away from you cuz you're [ __ ]

4175.279 --> 4181.52
[ __ ] and you let the entire world go

4178.56 --> 4185.159000000001
to hell and not do

4181.52 --> 4188.759
anything it's the trend of the 21st

4185.159 --> 4191.719
century let everything go to hell and

4188.759 --> 4194.48
don't do [ __ ] about

4191.719 --> 4197.4800000000005
it will you accept as you can't do

4194.48 --> 4200.759999999999
anything no no you accept that you won't

4197.48 --> 4203.5199999999995
do anything there's definitely something

4200.76 --> 4205.64
that you can do something that I can do

4203.52 --> 4208.2390000000005
a whole bunch of people can do we can

4205.64 --> 4211.360000000001
all do it I'd love to do it the problem

4208.239 --> 4214.5199999999995
is if I do it I'll get arrested and then

4211.36 --> 4216.48
I won't succeed and then I just poke the

4214.52 --> 4219.76
bee's nest and it's going to get worse

4216.48 --> 4222.12
and guess what besides me nobody else is

4219.76 --> 4224.1990000000005
going to do anything about it so I would

4222.12 --> 4225.96
have effectively made it worse because

4224.199 --> 4227.879999999999
nobody else is going to still do

4225.96 --> 4230.88
anything about it even if I do anything

4227.88 --> 4232.08
about it you see that's the [ __ ]

4230.88 --> 4235.2390000000005
issue

4232.08 --> 4237.04
here while if literally I have like a

4235.239 --> 4239.4
hundred or a thousand people patting me

4237.04 --> 4243.159
on the back it's like yeah Arwin you get

4239.4 --> 4245.239
in there and you do that then I'm going

4243.159 --> 4247.04
to [ __ ] do it dude give me a [ __ ]

4245.239 --> 4249.759999999999
machine gun I'll go right in the

4247.04 --> 4252.36
government building I'll go right do

4249.76 --> 4254.92
that yeah but I'm not going to do it if

4252.36 --> 4258.36
I'm going to end up in jail because

4254.92 --> 4261.12
everybody's too scared to do [ __ ] about

4258.36 --> 4262.199
anything yeah that's something that I'm

4261.12 --> 4266.199
not going to

4262.199 --> 4269.4
do but oh my God will I [ __ ] do that

4266.199 --> 4269.4
sort of [ __ ] oh

4270.28 --> 4276.44
yeah but I'm not just going to be a

4273.159 --> 4278.199
[ __ ] suicide bomber against Satan

4276.44 --> 4280.44
yeah that's the thing that I'm not going

4278.199 --> 4280.44
to

4281.679 --> 4287.6
do cuz nobody out there seems to give a

4284.8 --> 4290.6
[ __ ] about anything so if they're all

4287.6 --> 4293.88
willing to just die then why would I

4290.6 --> 4297.08
literally get myself killed if nobody

4293.88 --> 4299.88
else actually gives a [ __ ] and they'll

4297.08 --> 4301.88
probably even be intimidated enough to

4299.88 --> 4304.88
start pointing fingers and they say oh

4301.88 --> 4306.84
Arn's the bad man he's a

4304.88 --> 4310.36
terrorist the

4306.84 --> 4314.360000000001
system yeah yeah it's all

4310.36 --> 4316.44
[ __ ] because people don't agree

4314.36 --> 4319.159
they don't agree that it needs to be

4316.44 --> 4319.159
taken care

4319.52 --> 4327.56
of they will rather just keep doing what

4324.199 --> 4331.599999999999
they do and let everything degenerate

4327.56 --> 4333.6
and die miserably and they'll still have

4331.6 --> 4335.52
their little fantasy about oh no it's

4333.6 --> 4338.2390000000005
still good enough I still have something

4335.52 --> 4340.080000000001
oh I have so much to thankful about so

4338.239 --> 4342.48
much thankful about as you're starving

4340.08 --> 4345.48
to death in

4342.48 --> 4345.48
jail

4346.52 --> 4351.4800000000005
as you're literally living in a garbage

4348.92 --> 4353.4800000000005
pile Oh I said but I have so much to be

4351.48 --> 4356.678999999999
thankful for right yeah yeah that's

4353.48 --> 4358.959999999999
called escapism it's called cowardice

4356.679 --> 4361.88
it's called

4358.96 --> 4364.679
delusion Satan taking your mind so you

4361.88 --> 4367.76
can still feel a little good even though

4364.679 --> 4367.76
you're literally in

4372.44 --> 4375.44
hell

4379.51 --> 4384.2390000000005
[Music]

4380.96 --> 4385.87
everybody is [ __ ] nobody will do

4384.239 --> 4388.959999999999
anything about

4385.87 --> 4388.96
[Music]

4402.36 --> 4405.36
anything

4418.44 --> 4423.839999999999
am I watching it

4420.52 --> 4427.4800000000005
burn yeah I'm watching it burn and I'm

4423.84 --> 4431.04
like can I do something about it

4427.48 --> 4433.36
yet like can I have that contract that

4431.04 --> 4436.679
literally says yes you can take what

4433.36 --> 4440.239
ever necessary action you deem fit and

4436.679 --> 4442.639
you're completely exempt from all laws

4440.239 --> 4444.239
yeah that's the [ __ ] signed contract

4442.639 --> 4448.4400000000005
that I

4444.239 --> 4448.44
want to do something about

4450.12 --> 4455.199
it

4452.0 --> 4458.76
yeah that's what I want and then I'll

4455.199 --> 4458.759999999999
[ __ ] do whatever it

4458.88 --> 4463.56
takes I'm not going to die and I'm not

4461.44 --> 4466.36
going to go to jail for a bunch of

4463.56 --> 4466.360000000001
cowardly

4478.56 --> 4483.8
retards get the [ __ ] out of here Mato

4486.0 --> 4490.28
[ __ ] I am going to do something I'm

4488.48 --> 4493.599999999999
making a video game and I'm going to

4490.28 --> 4495.719
literally make it myself completely I'm

4493.6 --> 4498.639
not going to rely on other people

4495.719 --> 4501.4
anymore for making it because that's the

4498.639 --> 4504.88
mistake I made the first [ __ ] time

4501.4 --> 4507.5199999999995
and that caused me to never make it so

4504.88 --> 4511.36
I'm going to literally make the game all

4507.52 --> 4516.1990000000005
myself completely myself from scratch

4511.36 --> 4516.199
and then probably hire somebody for the

4516.96 --> 4523.92
graphics as a secondary part and then

4520.639 --> 4525.96
there's the people for the well for the

4523.92 --> 4528.76
media for the spreading of it and I'll

4525.96 --> 4531.04
probably take the bull Dash company the

4528.76 --> 4533.4400000000005
ones that typically deal with that for

4531.04 --> 4536.159
that and then I'll have some income and

4533.44 --> 4538.719
then I'll have something that I've done

4536.159 --> 4540.759999999999
and then I'll have a name like hey that

4538.719 --> 4543.4
guy actually program the video game

4540.76 --> 4544.56
that's really cool yeah and then I'll

4543.4 --> 4548.12
have

4544.56 --> 4550.0
things that I can suddenly do and people

4548.12 --> 4551.88
that suddenly take notice of me and they

4550.0 --> 4555.199
want something from me and then who

4551.88 --> 4555.1990000000005
knows what's going to happen

4555.719 --> 4560.88
at least I'll have some sort of a

4558.159 --> 4563.28
life or actually have something other

4560.88 --> 4565.0
than oh that guy just yaps on YouTube

4563.28 --> 4568.0
all day

4565.0 --> 4572.44
long and nobody really

4568.0 --> 4572.44
cares except for the people that do

4573.52 --> 4580.6
care right I'm going to run out the show

4577.04 --> 4585.12
it's been a mess but hey sometimes a

4580.6 --> 4585.120000000001
mess is what you get

4585.4 --> 4592.159
right so before I round out I'm

4588.32 --> 4595.96
definitely going to ask for a PayPal

4592.159 --> 4597.5199999999995
donation cuz I want one I I am going to

4595.96 --> 4601.199
need one and I'm going to start

4597.52 --> 4603.120000000001
hammering it because otherwise I'm

4601.199 --> 4606.199
literally going to run out of food again

4603.12 --> 4608.04
at the end of the month and I don't want

4606.199 --> 4611.839999999999
to get

4608.04 --> 4611.84
there please support

4612.08 --> 4617.12
me

4614.96 --> 4622.44
I'm going to need

4617.12 --> 4624.96
it yeah I barely get anything most of

4622.44 --> 4626.799999999999
the welfare that I get in it's all spent

4624.96 --> 4630.4800000000005
on rent and

4626.8 --> 4632.76
[ __ ] I need support or I literally can't

4630.48 --> 4632.759999999999
get

4641.84 --> 4645.76
around right and who knows maybe in the

4644.44 --> 4649.919999999999
future that will

4645.76 --> 4651.84
change GTI thing is still going there is

4649.92 --> 4654.6
going to be alterations and it could

4651.84 --> 4657.08
just be from one day to the next

4654.6 --> 4660.679
suddenly I got money available all the

4657.08 --> 4663.239
time it could just be but it can also

4660.679 --> 4665.4
take years before it get to that point

4663.239 --> 4667.959999999999
maybe it'll take like another seven

4665.4 --> 4669.96
years and oh we finally got it all and

4667.96 --> 4671.96
then suddenly oh all the internet's

4669.96 --> 4673.92
wiped out oh no it doesn't exist anymore

4671.96 --> 4676.28
of course because this second that I

4673.92 --> 4679.4400000000005
suddenly got released from this

4676.28 --> 4681.159
Perpetual [ __ ] poverty then of course

4679.44 --> 4682.96
that's the second that everything get

4681.159 --> 4686.12
