yeah the weather today again is

111.659 --> 120.14
beautiful

114.18 --> 120.14
very very similar to yesterday bit a win

121.14 --> 125.759
the Moon is up

123.54 --> 128.399
over there

125.759 --> 131.42
yeah but the webcam can pick it up

128.399 --> 131.42
but it's over there

131.64 --> 136.5
anyway it's beautiful it's very sunny

134.64 --> 138.26999999999998
very bright

136.5 --> 141.459
it's been like that all morning

138.27 --> 141.459
[Music]

142.379 --> 150.44
very beautiful day but cold

145.739 --> 150.44
and it is colder than they say it is

152.58 --> 158.3
it's measured a pair apparently

155.819 --> 158.29999999999998
anyway

159.12 --> 164.81900000000002
it's Monday the 27th of February 2023

167.16 --> 170.66
let's check the temperature

171.959 --> 178.34
seven degrees Celsius

174.26 --> 178.34
zero percent participation

178.62 --> 181.22
oh

181.62 --> 186.12
oh well that changed right now it says

183.599 --> 188.22
like it was oh it's all sunny

186.12 --> 190.739
remember from yesterday now it says wait

188.22 --> 192.72
Tuesday it's actually gonna hail and

190.739 --> 194.459
rain

192.72 --> 197.879
so I think there might be like a big

194.459 --> 199.44
storm on Tuesday

197.879 --> 201.89999999999998
and then Wednesday it's going to be

199.44 --> 204.2
fully Sunny according to this so we'll

201.9 --> 204.20000000000002
see

209.459 --> 213.5
so is anybody going to join the chat

214.319 --> 216.98
ugh

224.34 --> 228.14000000000001

269.68 --> 272.8
[Music]

275.46 --> 278.06
foreign

283.919 --> 289.919
because to you it's extra late if I

286.38 --> 291.9
start later but I mean yeah I do it for

289.919 --> 293.639
me

291.9 --> 296.35999999999996
I just started an hour later in the

293.639 --> 296.36
weekend I'm sorry

297.479 --> 300.8
hello Arc Ash

301.38 --> 304.04
welcome

304.13 --> 308.34
[Music]

305.699 --> 311.04
right that by the way Conversation Over

308.34 --> 314.03999999999996
the email with somebody that I've

311.04 --> 317.47900000000004
thought first said that I had banned

314.04 --> 317.47900000000004
them but what I didn't

318.18 --> 323.16
and they had like a link

320.639 --> 326.06
that this guy was also

323.16 --> 326.06
managing

327.24 --> 331.1
what was it again where is it

331.139 --> 336.479
that's like a a flat Earth TV guide and

334.56 --> 339.9
I'm in it

336.479 --> 342.65999999999997
even watched a video there

339.9 --> 346.28
but yeah I mean mostly like Flat Earth

342.66 --> 346.28000000000003
talk stays things

352.139 --> 356.0
where is it where's the link damn it

356.52 --> 359.29999999999995
what is this

371.28 --> 376.09999999999997
yeah but he sent me like a whole bunch

373.38 --> 376.1
of emails

380.1 --> 385.86
where is it ah

383.34 --> 388.19899999999996
no

385.86 --> 391.08000000000004
but he had this link

388.199 --> 392.40000000000003
to the TV Guide thing trying to find it

391.08 --> 395.24
back

392.4 --> 395.23999999999995
where is it

404.22 --> 408.86
I'm missing something this is weird

411.06 --> 414.06
foreign

420.96 --> 424.81899999999996
anyway I'll get back to that

425.4 --> 430.979
also watched a little YouTube Doc I

428.58 --> 433.21999999999997
think I've seen it even before

430.979 --> 436.979
it's probably older some

433.22 --> 439.16
reenactment group that's like building a

436.979 --> 439.15999999999997
mill

439.5 --> 445.08
Medieval Times like using a

442.8 --> 447.78000000000003
using water power

445.08 --> 450.06
to completely mechanically basically

447.78 --> 451.73999999999995
drive a millstone and they show how they

450.06 --> 454.139
build it all the way

451.74 --> 456.419
it's very fascinating I mean it is

454.139 --> 458.40000000000003
really fascinating because it really

456.419 --> 460.44
shows the detail of The Craft and all

458.4 --> 461.75899999999996
that there's that video if you want to

460.44 --> 463.919
check it out

461.759 --> 466.28000000000003
it's really like a Sunday Type video

463.919 --> 466.28
though

466.5 --> 470.58
if you're into

468.44 --> 473.039
old-fashioned crafting and all that and

470.58 --> 474.96
how did they do things like this this

473.039 --> 477.139
group because it's this group of people

474.96 --> 481.4
that do this

477.139 --> 481.40000000000003
is really interesting

485.4 --> 488.12
huh

491.66 --> 497.40000000000003
should start this yeah no turret

495.599 --> 499.37899999999996
I'm not gonna though

497.4 --> 500.099
oh I'm gonna responding to the same

499.379 --> 501.47900000000004
thing

500.099 --> 504.78
no

501.479 --> 509.84
yeah I I did that I needed

504.78 --> 509.84
an hour later in the weekend I really do

510.9 --> 513.68
foreign

520.32 --> 526.0200000000001
like I guess that by now I would

523.14 --> 530.42
probably even on average start later but

526.02 --> 530.42
in the weekdays it's the flatter debates

532.38 --> 538.5
right I used to start my shows around

535.8 --> 541.519
2PM Amsterdam time when I was doing

538.5 --> 541.519
flatter talks

542.12 --> 546.26
that's when I used to do it

547.08 --> 552.6600000000001
usually for an hour

549.959 --> 556.4399999999999
but then I expanded it so I had to pull

552.66 --> 558.42
back to 1 pm

556.44 --> 561.36
but yeah in the weekend Nathan doesn't

558.42 --> 564.36
do any live streams so I start an hour

561.36 --> 567.0
later and I can't just do that

564.36 --> 570.74
so

567.0 --> 570.74
my schedule's there for a reason

572.519 --> 576.08
anyway hello James Mays

579.44 --> 584.9590000000001
ah man I think I'm passing in master B

586.44 --> 591.1800000000001
yeah there it is

588.6 --> 594.3000000000001
here's the TV guide link

591.18 --> 598.2199999999999
it's kind of interesting I mean it is it

594.3 --> 598.2199999999999
seems to be though over the place but

603.24 --> 606.74
it is kind of interesting

611.16 --> 613.64
foreign

615.26 --> 620.3389999999999
if you guys want to check out flat

617.82 --> 622.5600000000001
earthers out there this TV Guide thing

620.339 --> 624.5400000000001
will bring you to a whole bunch of

622.56 --> 626.8199999999999
people that I've never even heard of

624.54 --> 629.0999999999999
most people in there I've never even

626.82 --> 631.98
heard of

629.1 --> 634.74
so it is an opportunity to check it out

631.98 --> 636.66
so if any of you are like oh yeah man I

634.74 --> 639.36
was looking for like a whole bunch of

636.66 --> 642.8389999999999
new people flat earthers out there on

639.36 --> 645.0
YouTube well here it is

642.839 --> 647.339
there's probably like a thousand people

645.0 --> 650.66
on there or something

647.339 --> 650.6600000000001
or at least hundreds

651.18 --> 656.459
and yeah you could check it out maybe

654.06 --> 658.8599999999999
there's one in there that happens to be

656.459 --> 660.959
incredibly good

658.86 --> 663.66
that we've that is just kind of keeping

660.959 --> 665.88
to himself or herself and never really

663.66 --> 668.399
being into Flat Earth debates maybe

665.88 --> 670.74
there's some really good ones in there

668.399 --> 673.26
so it might be worth checking it out and

670.74 --> 676.38
hey reporting back to me

673.26 --> 678.959
because I am on the lookout for some new

676.38 --> 681.3
channels actually myself

678.959 --> 683.4799999999999
since Jim Bob's kind of fallen off the

681.3 --> 683.4799999999999
list

686.18 --> 690.959
and oh yeah at least he said that he

690.12 --> 694.26
went

690.959 --> 696.42
or well said it he went ballistic I

694.26 --> 699.06
watched that entire show it was not as

696.42 --> 700.56
bad as I thought it didn't go for rage

699.06 --> 704.0999999999999
win

700.56 --> 706.1999999999999
but he did definitely like put all the

704.1 --> 708.5400000000001
irons in the fire

706.2 --> 710.899
or well maybe not even all of them but a

708.54 --> 710.899
lot of them

713.88 --> 719.24
it basically just took off the breaks of

716.64 --> 719.24
his jokes

720.72 --> 723.38
right

740.899 --> 748.04
oh yeah that was weird man I had this

744.42 --> 748.04
weird live stream notification

748.32 --> 753.36
and I'm like I can't even read that what

751.2 --> 756.12
is that some Channel I didn't know that

753.36 --> 758.279
I was subscribed and built and they

756.12 --> 760.98
didn't even speak English and it had no

758.279 --> 763.26
freaking idea what that was about

760.98 --> 764.519
wasn't even about Flat Earth or it that

763.26 --> 767.8199999999999
was weird

764.519 --> 771.5
like how the hell did I

767.82 --> 771.5
become subscribed to that

772.399 --> 777.42
is any ever anybody ever experienced

775.5 --> 780.54
that that you're suddenly subscribed to

777.42 --> 782.639
somebody that you literally never

780.54 --> 786.5
you have no idea how you would ever

782.639 --> 786.5
become subscribed to somebody like that

787.68 --> 790.399
it's weird

795.899 --> 801.06
anybody

798.32 --> 802.74
because it happened to me I was

801.06 --> 804.779
subscribe to somebody that I've never

802.74 --> 806.22
heard of didn't even understand their

804.779 --> 808.079
language at all didn't couldn't even

806.22 --> 810.5
figure out what subject they were

808.079 --> 810.5
talking about

811.38 --> 814.04
foreign

849.54 --> 856.16
right in the meantime

852.0 --> 856.16
I'm still very busy in my head

856.74 --> 862.62
trying to fill in more details of like

859.56 --> 864.66
the script for Baldur's Gate 3. I seem

862.62 --> 865.74
to have like an over structure in my

864.66 --> 868.38
mind

865.74 --> 871.26
which is basically the format of it

868.38 --> 874.019
without the content

871.26 --> 876.0
which is well what games really are

874.019 --> 878.16
organized like

876.0 --> 879.3
like this

878.16 --> 883.38
but

879.3 --> 887.279
I have I realized also that

883.38 --> 889.74
I personally have real trouble figuring

887.279 --> 892.74
out the Forgotten Realms

889.74 --> 894.54
deities and the culture even like it's

892.74 --> 897.839
what made Forgotten Realms kind of

894.54 --> 901.26
interesting to me because it's like so

897.839 --> 903.1800000000001
detailed and elaborate and mysterious in

901.26 --> 906.42
ways like how that realm has been

903.18 --> 908.88
designed and written about that I don't

906.42 --> 910.74
really fully get it

908.88 --> 913.079
and that's what I kind of made it

910.74 --> 915.72
appealing anyways because it's like

913.079 --> 918.42
there's so many these stories details

915.72 --> 920.1600000000001
about and I just don't really get it in

918.42 --> 922.4399999999999
ways sometimes

920.16 --> 924.24
sometimes I totally do and sometimes I

922.44 --> 927.6
don't and that I found that kind of

924.24 --> 929.4590000000001
interesting but it's hard to

927.6 --> 932.6990000000001
well I even tried to like Google

929.459 --> 935.2199999999999
Forgotten Realms Pantheon and it just

932.699 --> 937.62
rolled out this [ __ ] that I just like

935.22 --> 939.0
what the [ __ ] is that I didn't like

937.62 --> 942.42
recognize

939.0 --> 943.44
I recognized like three names on that

942.42 --> 946.5
list

943.44 --> 949.74
and it was like way too many it was like

946.5 --> 953.16
oh here is the the ones that start with

949.74 --> 955.139
an A and it was like 30.

953.16 --> 957.8389999999999
like what the [ __ ] are you serious

955.139 --> 960.36
there's like hundreds and hundreds of

957.839 --> 962.82
like how the hell do I know which ones

960.36 --> 964.019
are the original ones

962.82 --> 967.139
like

964.019 --> 969.8
I couldn't make out anything about it

967.139 --> 973.199
there was no

969.8 --> 975.18
intro type story to lay down like the

973.199 --> 977.76
basics of like here it starts there and

975.18 --> 980.16
these are the important ones there was

977.76 --> 982.68
just giant soup

980.16 --> 985.019
so I have trouble actually figuring out

982.68 --> 986.8199999999999
the Forgotten Realms it's making very it

985.019 --> 990.74
very hard on me

986.82 --> 990.74
to continue the design process

991.32 --> 995.7600000000001
right

993.06 --> 999.4799999999999
because I'd probably just used to the

995.76 --> 1002.24
default Pantheon system from DND which

999.48 --> 1004.519
is different very straightforward in

1002.24 --> 1007.4590000000001
ways

1004.519 --> 1008.66
but yeah I mean it's not the Forgotten

1007.459 --> 1009.92
Realms

1008.66 --> 1013.1
again

1009.92 --> 1015.079
if I would just just make a game of oh

1013.1 --> 1016.0400000000001
you're becoming a deity and then this

1015.079 --> 1018.38
happens

1016.04 --> 1021.759
and it would just be random it doesn't

1018.38 --> 1021.759
it wouldn't work

1021.86 --> 1026.299
it wouldn't work the game wouldn't work

1023.6 --> 1029.6
it has to be that story so

1026.299 --> 1031.52
I could make like a prototype

1029.6 --> 1035.6599999999999
based on

1031.52 --> 1038.179
the standard default DND deities

1035.66 --> 1040.1200000000001
and then hopefully that could be

1038.179 --> 1044.48
basically

1040.12 --> 1045.9189999999999
transformed by expert writers they

1044.48 --> 1047.54
really are knowledgeable about the

1045.919 --> 1049.6000000000001
Forgotten Realms embed have that

1047.54 --> 1053.0
basically transformed

1049.6 --> 1055.2199999999998
into the Forgotten Realms culture I

1053.0 --> 1058.22
could potentially try that

1055.22 --> 1060.58
but it could really like not work out in

1058.22 --> 1060.58
ways

1060.919 --> 1066.8600000000001
because well I don't actually understand

1064.4 --> 1070.2800000000002
the full

1066.86 --> 1072.26
cultural heritage of well the deities

1070.28 --> 1074.539
that are

1072.26 --> 1077.419
going to be

1074.539 --> 1080.3799999999999
basically part of the main focus of the

1077.419 --> 1080.38
very game story

1080.9 --> 1083.8600000000001
so it's tough

1087.38 --> 1095.0590000000002
I I wait I hope kind of to to bump into

1092.44 --> 1097.52
Forgotten Realms Enthusiast that could

1095.059 --> 1101.059
potentially help that has much more lore

1097.52 --> 1105.16
about this personally and could like

1101.059 --> 1105.16
help me out that would be great

1105.96 --> 1109.109
[Music]

1110.6 --> 1115.12
but unfortunately I don't really know

1112.88 --> 1115.1200000000001
any

1118.78 --> 1124.3999999999999
[Music]

1121.94 --> 1128.679
and the online stuff that I found so far

1124.4 --> 1128.679
is has not been extremely helpful

1138.26 --> 1142.64
I I can basically derive from the game a

1141.02 --> 1144.799
couple of characters that could

1142.64 --> 1148.22
definitely be key positions

1144.799 --> 1151.039
what I mean to just recycle like the

1148.22 --> 1153.559
deities and super characters that are in

1151.039 --> 1157.0
the Baldur's Gate game

1153.559 --> 1157.0
doesn't automatically

1157.1 --> 1162.6789999999999
fill in all the rest because I mean

1159.74 --> 1164.74
there's basically only one deity

1162.679 --> 1167.7800000000002
getting involved even though you could

1164.74 --> 1169.82
consider our minister to be some sort of

1167.78 --> 1171.3799999999999
a deity as well

1169.82 --> 1174.4399999999998
but he doesn't do anything he's just

1171.38 --> 1178.2990000000002
showing up like a cameo or because

1174.44 --> 1178.299
that's what he typically does apparently

1179.179 --> 1181.179
um

1181.94 --> 1186.3200000000002
he's kind of like the uh I forget his

1184.58 --> 1188.539
name

1186.32 --> 1190.6399999999999
guy that always Cameo is in Marvel

1188.539 --> 1192.76
Comics because he's like the writer of

1190.64 --> 1192.76
it

1192.98 --> 1198.08
shows up as random figures or El

1195.679 --> 1200.96
Minister isn't showing up as random

1198.08 --> 1203.299
figures he just randomly shows up

1200.96 --> 1206.74
never really does anything just kind of

1203.299 --> 1206.74
points out what's going on

1210.44 --> 1214.059
being very wizardly

1214.58 --> 1219.1999999999998
Stanley yeah that's the guy yeah

1216.86 --> 1220.58
so our ministers kind of the Stan Lee of

1219.2 --> 1224.14
the

1220.58 --> 1224.1399999999999
of the Forgotten Realms

1227.5 --> 1232.82
but he could definitely fill a role and

1230.48 --> 1235.34
he is a familiarity point I mean it

1232.82 --> 1238.039
would be pretty damn cool to suddenly

1235.34 --> 1239.24
get a minister more involved which is a

1238.039 --> 1241.8799999999999
like

1239.24 --> 1244.039
a bit

1241.88 --> 1245.6000000000001
out of the norm I mean if you just had a

1244.039 --> 1248.12
regular game El Minister would get all

1245.6 --> 1250.9399999999998
involved people would be like yeah but

1248.12 --> 1253.9399999999998
that's not what a minister does

1250.94 --> 1256.46
he is just like a cameo guy it was

1253.94 --> 1258.98
always on top right but I mean if

1256.46 --> 1261.08
there's like deity shifts

1258.98 --> 1262.22
now that would be the time for our

1261.08 --> 1265.58
minister

1262.22 --> 1268.46
Delight Gandalf like suddenly actually

1265.58 --> 1270.559
really starting to get involved and

1268.46 --> 1272.419
maybe he could even like play like a

1270.559 --> 1274.7
sort of in-between Diplomat characters

1272.419 --> 1276.919
among deities or something like that it

1274.7 --> 1279.8600000000001
could be pretty amazing

1276.919 --> 1282.5
right so I have things that I could do

1279.86 --> 1284.36
with characters that I already know but

1282.5 --> 1286.52
there are so many deities that I don't

1284.36 --> 1288.9189999999999
know about

1286.52 --> 1291.62
I know a couple

1288.919 --> 1294.679
like Tempest

1291.62 --> 1298.2199999999998
and uh

1294.679 --> 1300.88
like the the trout ID Char and

1298.22 --> 1300.88
wolf

1301.1 --> 1306.62
but I mean those are pretty fringe Gods

1303.5 --> 1310.64
most most of them well I mean tempus

1306.62 --> 1312.4399999999998
isn't but I just I only know about those

1310.64 --> 1314.7800000000002
deities because there's literally

1312.44 --> 1318.2
followers of those deities and they know

1314.78 --> 1320.78
rough description but I've never

1318.2 --> 1322.7
really knew too much of what I could

1320.78 --> 1325.1589999999999
probably just look them up specifically

1322.7 --> 1326.8400000000001
and just see if I could use them

1325.159 --> 1328.64
I think I just need to do a little bit

1326.84 --> 1331.22
more research I had hoped to like find

1328.64 --> 1333.38
the ultimate flowchart page that would

1331.22 --> 1336.32
just roll out the deities

1333.38 --> 1338.7800000000002
and then got a giant list in which

1336.32 --> 1342.9399999999998
included probably some

1338.78 --> 1342.94
some fan created stuff

1343.1 --> 1347.84
that's like really not too much involved

1345.919 --> 1349.94
that's just categorized on the same

1347.84 --> 1351.799
level in between all it that's what I

1349.94 --> 1354.5
think that I bumped into like it was

1351.799 --> 1357.1
like a fan Wiki thing too

1354.5 --> 1357.1
anyway

1357.26 --> 1361.31
I just have to work on it

1359.659 --> 1364.41
figure it out some more

1361.31 --> 1364.4099999999999
[Music]

1369.74 --> 1375.32
but I already got

1371.539 --> 1377.78
an interesting plot by the way for like

1375.32 --> 1379.34
for severock which is like one of the

1377.78 --> 1380.6589999999999
most interesting characters in the

1379.34 --> 1383.6
entire game

1380.659 --> 1385.94
the original opponent of Baldur's Gate 1

1383.6 --> 1388.1
your half brother

1385.94 --> 1391.159
who is evil

1388.1 --> 1393.4399999999998
he he wants to actually become he wanted

1391.159 --> 1396.2600000000002
to become the successor of all

1393.44 --> 1400.1000000000001
in that way

1396.26 --> 1402.08
right well you well you can choose most

1400.1 --> 1404.8999999999999
likely don't

1402.08 --> 1407.12
it's like a very Niche thing to attempt

1404.9 --> 1408.799
that and

1407.12 --> 1411.1589999999999
yeah

1408.799 --> 1414.62
but

1411.159 --> 1416.2990000000002
I mean it seems kind of obvious that if

1414.62 --> 1419.1399999999999
you're going to like abandon the Throne

1416.299 --> 1419.1399999999999
of ball and

1419.559 --> 1426.6789999999999
basically free up the space

1422.96 --> 1429.82
that savarok would probably try to

1426.679 --> 1429.8200000000002
restore it

1430.28 --> 1436.039
and basically rebuild it from scratch

1433.34 --> 1437.539
and he is like smart and driven enough

1436.039 --> 1439.84
to do it

1437.539 --> 1441.52
is like this

1439.84 --> 1444.4399999999998
selfish

1441.52 --> 1446.96
power-hungry guy that just refuses to

1444.44 --> 1450.26
die like he just he just won't stay dead

1446.96 --> 1452.48
just keeps

1450.26 --> 1453.919
coming back I mean it's literally part

1452.48 --> 1456.8600000000001
of the theme

1453.919 --> 1459.44
of the game doesn't bothers gate 2 in

1456.86 --> 1462.4399999999998
the last part of it

1459.44 --> 1465.74
he literally like a ghost shows up and

1462.44 --> 1468.2
it's like okay uh

1465.74 --> 1470.96
make me alive again and I'll give you

1468.2 --> 1472.7
this key information what you need to

1470.96 --> 1475.52
continue and then you do that because

1472.7 --> 1477.74
otherwise you can't continue and he's

1475.52 --> 1480.44
alive again and he can then become a

1477.74 --> 1484.1200000000001
part of your party because he's not like

1480.44 --> 1489.1000000000001
competing anymore because he's lost his

1484.12 --> 1489.1
balls Pawn Essence because he died

1491.299 --> 1496.34
anyway

1493.82 --> 1497.96
idea about that so there's already all

1496.34 --> 1500.12
kinds of content that could probably

1497.96 --> 1502.58
even outside of the overall are

1500.12 --> 1504.62
overarching concept be like games on

1502.58 --> 1507.4399999999998
their own

1504.62 --> 1510.3799999999999
and that is kind of the magic also of

1507.44 --> 1512.96
this entire game concept is that

1510.38 --> 1515.72
if you keep all these story things kind

1512.96 --> 1519.14
of small as like things that happen

1515.72 --> 1521.84
while you're doing stuff

1519.14 --> 1523.3400000000001
you could even like make game spin-offs

1521.84 --> 1527.1789999999999
off that

1523.34 --> 1530.48
of the events but from somebody else's

1527.179 --> 1532.46
perspective not from you as a deity your

1530.48 --> 1534.5
perspective

1532.46 --> 1537.14
like an advent you could have an

1534.5 --> 1540.32
adventure just drop in that world and

1537.14 --> 1543.14
have their own story based on these

1540.32 --> 1546.62
events that are unrolling because what

1543.14 --> 1550.5800000000002
you are doing in Boulders gate 3.

1546.62 --> 1553.039
like a follow-up game

1550.58 --> 1555.3799999999999
multiple follow-up games about things

1553.039 --> 1558.14
that have actually happened

1555.38 --> 1560.5590000000002
because I mean in Barbers Gate 3 in this

1558.14 --> 1563.8400000000001
deity game time is going to be different

1560.559 --> 1565.76
because I think I want a system where

1563.84 --> 1569.24
there is basically

1565.76 --> 1571.64
large time intervals like if you do like

1569.24 --> 1573.44
as a deity sitting there and managing

1571.64 --> 1574.5200000000002
things and doing things with the Outer

1573.44 --> 1576.6200000000001
Planes

1574.52 --> 1578.6589999999999
I think that that should literally make

1576.62 --> 1581.539
time pass so that you have to choose

1578.659 --> 1585.2600000000002
when you engage with Outer Planes and

1581.539 --> 1589.24
then realize that's gonna make time skip

1585.26 --> 1589.24
gonna make time progress quicker

1589.34 --> 1595.8799999999999
and basically give an opportunity for

1592.34 --> 1600.1
things to seed and breed and change how

1595.88 --> 1600.1000000000001
the realm Works in ways

1600.44 --> 1607.1200000000001
to have new characters pop up

1603.98 --> 1607.1200000000001
old ones die

1607.58 --> 1612.32
age perhaps

1609.799 --> 1614.12
which could be very convenient even for

1612.32 --> 1615.86
some voice actors that are now like it's

1614.12 --> 1621.02
20 years later more than 20 years later

1615.86 --> 1625.6
right so all kinds of possibilities

1621.02 --> 1625.6
based on that a Time differential

1645.5 --> 1651.02
hello Oz

1647.539 --> 1654.679
that video is limited

1651.02 --> 1657.679
which that video

1654.679 --> 1662.38
the first link

1657.679 --> 1662.38
is that limited how is that limited

1702.32 --> 1709.779
okay well the chat is completely [ __ ]

1705.38 --> 1709.779
dead today that's just [ __ ] great

1710.86 --> 1713.9799999999998
[Music]

1716.299 --> 1721.76
or is this me is this the

1718.4 --> 1724.94
YouTube okay what's going on here

1721.76 --> 1728.74
no no the chat is just dead what the

1724.94 --> 1728.74
[ __ ] guys what the [ __ ]

1729.64 --> 1735.039
any level of feedback would be great

1744.63 --> 1747.999
[Music]

1758.0 --> 1762.02
do I need to start yelling at the chat

1760.46 --> 1764.72
again

1762.02 --> 1767.299
for [ __ ] sake guys

1764.72 --> 1768.74
why does this keep happening to my

1767.299 --> 1772.34
[ __ ] chat

1768.74 --> 1776.26
I'm so sick of it

1772.34 --> 1776.26
speak in my chat

1779.059 --> 1786.5
I'm sick of this [ __ ] silence there

1783.44 --> 1790.059
I want to interact

1786.5 --> 1790.059
say something

1812.44 --> 1816.26
hello mystical Rock Island fossils good

1815.299 --> 1820.279
to see you

1816.26 --> 1822.98
don't know what the [ __ ] is going on man

1820.279 --> 1825.38
why do I get so freaking little feedback

1822.98 --> 1828.559
I mean oh yeah the last half hour

1825.38 --> 1831.0200000000002
everybody keeps yapping the first hour

1828.559 --> 1833.24
man I mean what the [ __ ] is this I'm

1831.02 --> 1835.94
trying to lay down things I'm literally

1833.24 --> 1838.7
asking for feedback and people just shut

1835.94 --> 1839.8990000000001
the [ __ ] up for 15 minutes saying

1838.7 --> 1843.0800000000002
nothing

1839.899 --> 1844.6999999999998
even when I get outraged about it you

1843.08 --> 1846.98
just say nothing

1844.7 --> 1849.2
I'm sick of it

1846.98 --> 1851.72
why the [ __ ] do I even do this show

1849.2 --> 1854.8600000000001
anymore if nobody gives me any [ __ ]

1851.72 --> 1854.8600000000001
feedback when it happens

1875.2 --> 1880.5800000000002
it's like our world we have major themes

1878.899 --> 1882.4399999999998
and then we have all these little

1880.58 --> 1885.039
individual stores all interconnecting

1882.44 --> 1887.3600000000001
and changing it yeah

1885.039 --> 1890.059
it's kind of funny you mentioned that

1887.36 --> 1892.6589999999999
because that is exactly how the game

1890.059 --> 1892.6589999999999
works too

1896.179 --> 1901.22
I mean Baldur's Gate

1898.22 --> 1903.32
is about the development of the

1901.22 --> 1905.3600000000001
characters and they have a wide variety

1903.32 --> 1907.34
of character interactions there's like

1905.36 --> 1910.58
that's in the wiki too there's a whole

1907.34 --> 1913.1
chart of all the characters and how they

1910.58 --> 1915.559
respond to every character

1913.1 --> 1918.1999999999998
like unique interactions they have

1915.559 --> 1919.6399999999999
standard interactions they have based on

1918.2 --> 1922.7
their alignment

1919.64 --> 1925.279
really interesting but the characters

1922.7 --> 1927.919
make the actual game because they are

1925.279 --> 1931.88
written in a way that they undergo the

1927.919 --> 1934.159
story too and give their responses

1931.88 --> 1937.419
so you're like with simulated people

1934.159 --> 1937.419
that go through the game

1937.52 --> 1945.08
with you and that makes the story

1942.32 --> 1947.12
if it was just your character and just a

1945.08 --> 1950.899
bunch of bland puppets without any

1947.12 --> 1954.1
character the game would be [ __ ]

1950.899 --> 1954.1
it's fascinating

1954.5 --> 1959.6
I mean without those things it would

1956.96 --> 1962.799
just be like Diablo just like run around

1959.6 --> 1962.799
and chop things up

1964.94 --> 1969.98
and wait until the opponent starts

1968.0 --> 1972.26
yapping

1969.98 --> 1973.94
like rolling out his evil Plan before

1972.26 --> 1974.899
you can strike them down and that's it

1973.94 --> 1977.419
right

1974.899 --> 1978.9799999999998
that gets boring really quickly I find

1977.419 --> 1982.3400000000001
Baldur's Gate very appealing

1978.98 --> 1983.779
specifically because there's characters

1982.34 --> 1986.36
in there

1983.779 --> 1988.82
that develop

1986.36 --> 1991.2199999999998
and interact and respond and give their

1988.82 --> 1992.899
view on things and some background story

1991.22 --> 1996.6200000000001
to them

1992.899 --> 1998.0
and it's really interesting it works

1996.62 --> 2000.039
that way

1998.0 --> 2002.32
even with characters that I've been

2000.039 --> 2003.82
playing over and over again it still is

2002.32 --> 2007.1789999999999
like interesting being with those

2003.82 --> 2008.9189999999999
characters over and over again

2007.179 --> 2010.299
because I like them I think they're

2008.919 --> 2013.48
funny

2010.299 --> 2015.059
they're just interesting

2013.48 --> 2019.44
and

2015.059 --> 2019.44
that's good writing

2019.659 --> 2022.2
anyway

2024.6 --> 2031.4399999999998
how many people have I banned

2028.12 --> 2031.4399999999998
yeah how many

2032.98 --> 2037.6200000000001
recently how many people have I actually

2035.2 --> 2037.6200000000001
been

2037.72 --> 2044.22
that we're just straight out ankle

2040.12 --> 2044.2199999999998
biting ad homing trolls

2044.76 --> 2049.419
very little

2046.96 --> 2051.7
I mean I kick woodworking gummy bear out

2049.419 --> 2055.3199999999997
but I unblocked him again but he was

2051.7 --> 2055.3199999999997
acting like a bastard

2057.879 --> 2063.399
it was acting off and in a way that's

2061.54 --> 2067.599
not allowed in this [ __ ] yeah I don't

2063.399 --> 2071.5
bend everybody this is [ __ ] yeah I

2067.599 --> 2074.619
actually go around FD chat getting into

2071.5 --> 2077.98
arguments even fights with fellow flat

2074.619 --> 2081.159
earthers because I try to tell them not

2077.98 --> 2084.419
to just straight out ban people that say

2081.159 --> 2084.4190000000003
it's a ball okay

2084.72 --> 2087.9599999999996
Winding Lane

2089.02 --> 2093.22
so it's [ __ ] I don't just bet in

2091.359 --> 2095.2599999999998
everybody I don't do that at all and it

2093.22 --> 2098.3799999999997
has nothing to do

2095.26 --> 2100.0600000000004
with people just not responding when I

2098.38 --> 2102.94
specifically asked like hey could I get

2100.06 --> 2106.18
some feedback and then keep talking and

2102.94 --> 2108.46
then 15 minutes later nothing yeah that

2106.18 --> 2111.04
has nothing to do

2108.46 --> 2115.14
with people oh I'm afraid to say

2111.04 --> 2115.14
something because I might get banned

2115.9 --> 2121.06
unless I'm wrong unless I don't know

2118.359 --> 2122.619
dinosaur gaining wisdom mystical

2121.06 --> 2125.16
rockhound

2122.619 --> 2125.1600000000003
right

2126.16 --> 2129.48
stupid [ __ ]

2129.52 --> 2134.02
Mouse

2131.8 --> 2135.04
turret like unless you disagree with

2134.02 --> 2137.2599999999998
that

2135.04 --> 2139.599
unless you are really nervous to just

2137.26 --> 2140.92
speak to your your mind or your feelings

2139.599 --> 2145.1400000000003
because you're afraid you're gonna get

2140.92 --> 2145.14
mad if that's it let me know

2145.72 --> 2149.0989999999997
but I don't think so

2152.74 --> 2157.4799999999996
although I'd love to know if there is

2154.96 --> 2159.94
something else that is obstructing you

2157.48 --> 2161.44
from just flowing

2159.94 --> 2163.2400000000002
and just

2161.44 --> 2165.7200000000003
getting into it

2163.24 --> 2165.72
quick

2168.099 --> 2173.56
am I a heart pill to swallow in my heart

2170.8 --> 2175.78
to tune into the focus on it you need

2173.56 --> 2178.42
all your energy to do just that and you

2175.78 --> 2180.4
can't really think for yourself in order

2178.42 --> 2183.099
to communicate like what's going on here

2180.4 --> 2185.6800000000003
guys I really want to know this

2183.099 --> 2189.28
because this issue keeps reoccurring and

2185.68 --> 2191.9199999999996
it's starting to really get on my nerves

2189.28 --> 2195.76
why does it get on my nerves because it

2191.92 --> 2198.099
happens when I'm kind of peak energy

2195.76 --> 2202.079
and like I can do all this stuff and

2198.099 --> 2202.079
just everybody's just sitting there

2202.78 --> 2207.0400000000004
like they're all turning to zombies all

2204.82 --> 2210.599
of a sudden while I'm all energized it's

2207.04 --> 2210.599
really [ __ ] annoying

2212.26 --> 2217.3
there's nothing worse than getting all

2214.96 --> 2219.579
this power and not being able to do

2217.3 --> 2221.76
anything with it okay

2219.579 --> 2221.76
foreign

2233.41 --> 2238.24
[Music]

2235.92 --> 2241.119
a little about computer games that's

2238.24 --> 2243.3999999999996
fine that's reasonable

2241.119 --> 2246.78
right it's not just computer this is

2243.4 --> 2246.78
about story writing

2247.18 --> 2251.22
about the story of A game

2252.16 --> 2256.8999999999996
I mean Baldur's Gate is very story

2255.04 --> 2260.579
driven game

2256.9 --> 2260.579
and that's why I like it

2260.8 --> 2268.44
just because story list games

2264.52 --> 2268.44
I get bored with them really quickly

2276.46 --> 2280.98
anyway let me read the rest of what you

2278.38 --> 2280.98
guys are saying

2292.96 --> 2298.78
I read react to it

2295.54 --> 2303.42
to comments too fast sometimes yeah I do

2298.78 --> 2303.42
I agree and then I correct when I see it

2316.24 --> 2321.339
that boys play video games men create

2319.06 --> 2323.7999999999997
video that's hilarious dancer haven't

2321.339 --> 2326.339
heard that one before I appreciate the

2323.8 --> 2326.3390000000004
compliment

2326.98 --> 2332.98
and yeah dude I was going to become a

2330.339 --> 2335.0789999999997
game designer and then the world said go

2332.98 --> 2336.7
[ __ ] yourself

2335.079 --> 2340.5
basically

2336.7 --> 2340.5
it's like nobody seemed to care

2345.64 --> 2351.2999999999997
I mean I bet if I had like Millions

2348.099 --> 2354.7000000000003
people would suddenly give a [ __ ]

2351.3 --> 2355.54
because then I could probably just try

2354.7 --> 2359.02
to

2355.54 --> 2363.06
yeah actually build a business and make

2359.02 --> 2363.06
it make that game

2363.88 --> 2369.04
or as people would love to suggest no

2366.4 --> 2370.839
you don't need money you just start oh

2369.04 --> 2373.5
yeah

2370.839 --> 2373.5
sure

2378.94 --> 2384.76
what I do need for it is a plan

2381.16 --> 2387.04
basically a design plan and then it's

2384.76 --> 2388.0
probably just a matter of just trying to

2387.04 --> 2391.66
find

2388.0 --> 2394.92
figure out how much it would cost who I

2391.66 --> 2394.92
would want to be part of that

2395.38 --> 2399.119
and then getting the funds together

2400.48 --> 2408.04
it would certainly be like a Worthy

2404.5 --> 2411.22
long big GoFundMe situation it wouldn't

2408.04 --> 2413.14
be flat earth related

2411.22 --> 2415.0
it would be for a game

2413.14 --> 2417.46
and there's

2415.0 --> 2422.579
like businesses out there that are even

2417.46 --> 2422.579
like specialized in promoting that

2423.28 --> 2427.8390000000004
getting it in everybody's attention in

2425.5 --> 2430.42
the right spot so

2427.839 --> 2432.94
it it is in my view doable like I

2430.42 --> 2435.82
actually feel like I could do it

2432.94 --> 2438.48
it's just that I have a lot to do before

2435.82 --> 2438.48
I get there

2447.76 --> 2452.92
unless everybody just suddenly starts to

2450.579 --> 2454.96
want to cooperate with me for some crazy

2452.92 --> 2457.7400000000002
reason

2454.96 --> 2457.7400000000002
the

2460.119 --> 2464.579
that's probably not gonna happen anytime

2462.28 --> 2464.579
soon

2487.72 --> 2489.8999999999996
thank you

2503.14 --> 2510.54
okay getting wisdom that sounds pretty

2506.2 --> 2510.54
cool thank you for sharing that story

2518.5 --> 2523.0
I'm fierce

2520.48 --> 2525.94
in the comments yeah but I'm not that

2523.0 --> 2530.619
Fierce mystical Rock Hound

2525.94 --> 2533.14
it's just that if somebody gets gamma

2530.619 --> 2538.32
but I know this ankle biting energy then

2533.14 --> 2538.3199999999997
I will be very harsh on that

2538.78 --> 2543.94
because I know if you let that sit it it

2541.72 --> 2545.7999999999997
could actually lead to complete

2543.94 --> 2548.079
character change around character

2545.8 --> 2549.579
corruption it's that bad people don't

2548.079 --> 2552.099
realize that

2549.579 --> 2554.6400000000003
if you give into like ankle biting type

2552.099 --> 2557.26
Behavior you will

2554.64 --> 2559.66
completely convert to that if people

2557.26 --> 2561.5200000000004
just let you and accept that

2559.66 --> 2564.42
it's corruption

2561.52 --> 2564.42
of a person

2564.46 --> 2571.54
no guarantee they'll stop doing that all

2567.64 --> 2574.2999999999997
of a sudden it's it'll start to

2571.54 --> 2577.56
stick to them if you do that so I'm very

2574.3 --> 2577.5600000000004
harsh because of that reason

2580.3 --> 2584.3390000000004
but I mean as long as you don't do that

2586.599 --> 2592.6600000000003
like you can politely disagree right

2590.02 --> 2595.38
guys I mean you can do that right it's

2592.66 --> 2597.94
just if you're going to be like yeah

2595.38 --> 2601.7400000000002
that's gonna be like

2597.94 --> 2601.7400000000002
um you tone that down

2602.079 --> 2606.28
right

2603.339 --> 2608.859
I'm not that bad on the chat

2606.28 --> 2610.3590000000004
I mean it used to be a lot worse it used

2608.859 --> 2612.819
to be much more

2610.359 --> 2616.18
heavy on the Banning

2612.819 --> 2619.5
but I'm not really like that anymore now

2616.18 --> 2619.5
am I be honest

2619.9 --> 2624.42
hello by the way Nathan Oakley 1980 good

2622.06 --> 2624.42
to see you

2634.18 --> 2638.16
I'll be your creator without excuses

2639.339 --> 2641.64
foreign

2657.839 --> 2663.94
look I made my DND book the trolls and

2661.839 --> 2666.5789999999997
tyrants I just did it

2663.94 --> 2668.44
without any profit in view just because

2666.579 --> 2670.9
I wanted to do it

2668.44 --> 2672.94
and I have done it yeah it took me a

2670.9 --> 2675.819
long time but it's there it's it's like

2672.94 --> 2678.4
everybody can technically use it

2675.819 --> 2680.74
and it is it is written to be very

2678.4 --> 2683.38
compatible but with the old system now

2680.74 --> 2685.1189999999997
everything's all moved on because yeah

2683.38 --> 2687.4
the Wizards of the Coast they're just

2685.119 --> 2689.079
moving on through basically throwing

2687.4 --> 2691.96
everything in the bin from the past and

2689.079 --> 2694.78
just re-rolling out with their new stuff

2691.96 --> 2698.8
and that new stuff has dramatically

2694.78 --> 2703.619
changed the overall culture of the game

2698.8 --> 2707.619
it's not the same now there is Goofy DND

2703.619 --> 2711.1600000000003
right DND used to be pretty freaking

2707.619 --> 2714.88
serious in many ways now it's all Goofy

2711.16 --> 2717.3999999999996
and cartoonish like that's the new style

2714.88 --> 2719.6800000000003
and that's how people DND so they

2717.4 --> 2721.0
probably just adapted to their target

2719.68 --> 2724.2
group

2721.0 --> 2724.2
what the hell is going on

2727.14 --> 2731.22
YouTube is acting weird again

2747.7 --> 2752.8799999999997
all right anyway back to normal

2755.859 --> 2759.54
YouTube keeps stalling this is so

2758.079 --> 2762.76
annoying

2759.54 --> 2762.7599999999998
[Music]

2774.7 --> 2781.02
right but the funny thing is now is that

2777.76 --> 2784.2400000000002
in the past I would be preoccupied

2781.02 --> 2786.819
making video games a lot

2784.24 --> 2789.359
did my video just freeze

2786.819 --> 2789.359
no

2790.18 --> 2794.94
the hell is going on with YouTube

2800.4 --> 2805.06
I don't know if you guys are having

2802.42 --> 2807.46
issues with YouTube I'm just it just

2805.06 --> 2809.2
keeps freezing up and acting really

2807.46 --> 2813.46
weird

2809.2 --> 2815.6189999999997
but yeah I mean the I think the actual

2813.46 --> 2819.64
the OBS is acting normal it's YouTube

2815.619 --> 2821.5
itself right but I'm just learning about

2819.64 --> 2823.54
what I think

2821.5 --> 2826.18
seven or six

2823.54 --> 2828.579
really really I used to like draw video

2826.18 --> 2832.72
games as a little kid it would typically

2828.579 --> 2834.819
I would basically I would do that a lot

2832.72 --> 2838.359
like all the time

2834.819 --> 2842.099
did a lot of that right but I didn't

2838.359 --> 2842.0989999999997
really environment or

2842.14 --> 2846.819
the

2843.819 --> 2850.42
how what you could do with them but now

2846.819 --> 2851.68
of something of a game okay and I then I

2850.42 --> 2853.359
think

2851.68 --> 2854.74
it wouldn't even be all that special

2853.359 --> 2857.38
today

2854.74 --> 2858.52
I'm I'm going to be as a game designer

2857.38 --> 2860.44
very

2858.52 --> 2863.52
Hammer around again don't like those

2860.44 --> 2863.52
games at all

2864.04 --> 2868.9
like games that don't just try to

2866.319 --> 2870.7
distract you oh look at this look at

2868.9 --> 2871.98
this reflection oh look at the beautiful

2870.7 --> 2875.6189999999997
people

2871.98 --> 2878.8
I hate that I [ __ ] can stand games

2875.619 --> 2882.1800000000003
that do that I really hate it I like

2878.8 --> 2882.1800000000003
games that are still

2882.64 --> 2889.42
where you can really like

2885.46 --> 2892.54
soft focus just in your mind connect to

2889.42 --> 2895.66
that world and you can just listen

2892.54 --> 2897.2799999999997
where you can listen a lot very auditory

2895.66 --> 2899.859
music

2897.28 --> 2903.28
that's really about what's happening or

2899.859 --> 2906.2999999999997
what your what your character is feeling

2903.28 --> 2910.3590000000004
good voice acting that's important

2906.3 --> 2913.3590000000004
freaking Graphics man Graphics are

2910.359 --> 2915.72
secondary in a good video game in my

2913.359 --> 2915.72
opinion

2916.42 --> 2919.14
foreign

2919.74 --> 2925.1189999999997
so I could even like make a style of it

2922.91 --> 2927.46
[Music]

2925.119 --> 2930.1600000000003
like oh there you have an arwyn Style

2927.46 --> 2932.859
video game

2930.16 --> 2935.2599999999998
and you're gonna love it

2932.859 --> 2937.66
and the good thing is there are still

2935.26 --> 2940.5
good games out there I mean

2937.66 --> 2940.5
what's it called again

2942.339 --> 2948.0
I think it was Pathfinder called

2944.02 --> 2948.0
Pathfinder yeah Pathfinder

2948.099 --> 2954.28
but the other the original one not the

2951.94 --> 2956.079
Wrath of the righteous I don't think

2954.28 --> 2958.96
that game works very

2956.079 --> 2960.6400000000003
great I didn't like it but the original

2958.96 --> 2965.02
one

2960.64 --> 2970.06
it was made really well it was made

2965.02 --> 2971.2599999999998
like how I would make a game like this

2970.06 --> 2973.599
simple

2971.26 --> 2975.3390000000004
straightforward fluid

2973.599 --> 2978.2400000000002
beautiful

2975.339 --> 2978.24
and

2979.96 --> 2984.16
yeah it was it was still story driven

2982.48 --> 2987.28
but it's like

2984.16 --> 2991.1189999999997
not as elaborate a story but the music

2987.28 --> 2993.1600000000003
would still fill it in pretty good

2991.119 --> 2995.1400000000003
and I like that

2993.16 --> 2999.52
so I mean the people that made

2995.14 --> 3002.04
Pathfinder would be a group for me to

2999.52 --> 3005.339
kind of like hey could you

3002.04 --> 3008.88
would you like to make another game

3005.339 --> 3010.44
seem to have the right skills there

3008.88 --> 3013.5
right

3010.44 --> 3015.54
those yeah that crew I'd definitely be

3013.5 --> 3018.619
interested in

3015.54 --> 3018.619
in working together

3020.22 --> 3025.7999999999997
so there are still good

3022.92 --> 3028.339
game programmers and conceptual people

3025.8 --> 3028.3390000000004
out there

3029.76 --> 3035.1600000000003
so it yeah what I have envisioned can

3032.579 --> 3037.26
definitely be done it's just like how

3035.16 --> 3040.5
would it be done

3037.26 --> 3044.5400000000004
and especially how could it be avoided

3040.5 --> 3047.46
to be undermined and exploded

3044.54 --> 3049.859
ruined like as it's already going

3047.46 --> 3052.319
because that could happen that happens

3049.859 --> 3056.0
out there

3052.319 --> 3056.0
they're saboteurs too

3058.26 --> 3063.96
or people that are just so unstable

3061.5 --> 3066.839
that you think they can do something and

3063.96 --> 3070.14
then they just basically go completely

3066.839 --> 3073.98
nuts and and start sabotaging the whole

3070.14 --> 3076.3799999999997
thing often like even halting the entire

3073.98 --> 3078.2400000000002
production right

3076.38 --> 3079.7400000000002
those are kind of things that I'm a bit

3078.24 --> 3082.9399999999996
worried about

3079.74 --> 3085.319
but maybe I'd be might be jumping ahead

3082.94 --> 3087.8
schedule a little bit much with the

3085.319 --> 3087.8
worry there

3090.059 --> 3096.9
hello Tim Burns what Chad is dead yeah

3094.38 --> 3099.359
hey that's what I've been telling the

3096.9 --> 3101.579
people that are in my chat too

3099.359 --> 3102.9
see I'm just talking and talking and

3101.579 --> 3106.88
like yeah

3102.9 --> 3106.88
people just don't say anything

3110.579 --> 3115.38
as it might be because of buffering

3112.5 --> 3118.5
although it's not buffering right now at

3115.38 --> 3122.71
least is it it's not on my end anymore

3118.5 --> 3123.96
hey LSG good to see you yeah you're late

3122.71 --> 3126.559
[Music]

3123.96 --> 3126.559
it's okay

3138.5 --> 3143.42
right but anyway before I can

3144.24 --> 3149.9399999999996
really start figuring out how I could

3147.18 --> 3152.46
get a game like this program I have to

3149.94 --> 3155.28
just make the

3152.46 --> 3158.339
the flow chart of it I have to basically

3155.28 --> 3160.579
summarize what the game format is going

3158.339 --> 3160.5789999999997
to be

3167.04 --> 3171.96
what's going to be like

3169.2 --> 3173.9399999999996
and yeah I have the priority set

3171.96 --> 3176.579
straight I mean music is going to be a

3173.94 --> 3178.92
critical role I it's gonna have like the

3176.579 --> 3181.8590000000004
best music ever although yeah that's

3178.92 --> 3186.2400000000002
what they all say but I would really I

3181.859 --> 3188.94
would get pushy on My Music Makers like

3186.24 --> 3192.0
like yeah this is okay but it needs a

3188.94 --> 3196.079
little bit more that that and probably

3192.0 --> 3199.02
get on their nerves a lot but I nah

3196.079 --> 3201.0
like if they could handle that I mean if

3199.02 --> 3203.04
they're gonna just get sick of it and

3201.0 --> 3205.7
abandon or something that would be

3203.04 --> 3205.7
[ __ ]

3206.22 --> 3212.4599999999996
but I have I'm gonna have really [ __ ]

3209.7 --> 3215.0989999999997
high standards for the music and it's

3212.46 --> 3219.7200000000003
not just anything

3215.099 --> 3223.44
at all because I want it to be

3219.72 --> 3228.1189999999997
of the same mysterious quality and depth

3223.44 --> 3230.4
as the original Baldur's Gate music

3228.119 --> 3233.76
which is difficult because that sound

3230.4 --> 3235.7400000000002
effects of a different era still

3233.76 --> 3237.599
it's going to be very hard act to follow

3235.74 --> 3239.819
and I think that some people have

3237.599 --> 3242.1600000000003
definitely attempted that and then

3239.819 --> 3245.099
partially succeeded I mean there's some

3242.16 --> 3248.2799999999997
really good music in Pathfinder

3245.099 --> 3250.7400000000002
some really awesome things that they've

3248.28 --> 3255.42
accomplished with that

3250.74 --> 3260.22
they're very appealing to me but

3255.42 --> 3263.88
could they basically continue wait

3260.22 --> 3265.5
the music from bowler's gate

3263.88 --> 3267.1800000000003
because it's it's going to be a

3265.5 --> 3269.88
follow-up game so it would have to

3267.18 --> 3272.7599999999998
actually you would have to be able to

3269.88 --> 3275.339
listen to it and feel and basically play

3272.76 --> 3278.2200000000003
it right after Baldur's Gate 2 and that

3275.339 --> 3281.94
it's like one thing

3278.22 --> 3283.8199999999997
now that's difficult

3281.94 --> 3287.149
anyway

3283.82 --> 3287.1490000000003
[Music]

3304.17 --> 3307.289
[Music]

3308.28 --> 3313.6400000000003
the Ballers are attacking the stream I

3310.74 --> 3313.64
don't see it though

3325.859 --> 3333.74
all right we by the way it could move on

3328.44 --> 3333.7400000000002
from the subject both Gate 3 idea

3337.559 --> 3341.76
listening to some music from that game

3339.839 --> 3343.14
yesterday

3341.76 --> 3345.0
oh

3343.14 --> 3347.96
wait which game

3345.0 --> 3347.96
Baldur's Gate

3348.57 --> 3351.839
[Music]

3349.859 --> 3354.7999999999997
okay if you want to listen to that music

3351.839 --> 3354.7999999999997
I got links

3355.26 --> 3360.2000000000003
got Links of the full works

3357.839 --> 3364.339
it's a lot

3360.2 --> 3364.339
uh let's see where is it

3380.579 --> 3386.54
right this is the full soundtrack from

3383.579 --> 3386.54
roller skate one

3386.839 --> 3391.94
Boulder Escape now a boulder escape the

3390.48 --> 3396.72
a

3391.94 --> 3396.7200000000003
Boulder skit that's weird uh

3398.7 --> 3405.2999999999997
all right and this one it's gonna be

3401.579 --> 3408.44
very hard to act to follow up on

3405.3 --> 3408.44
this guy too

3418.74 --> 3424.0789999999997
it's gonna be even more difficult

3421.8 --> 3427.619
because I actually want to push the

3424.079 --> 3430.94
boundaries a bit concerning the music

3427.619 --> 3435.54
because what I want really is to be

3430.94 --> 3439.2000000000003
having different slightly perhaps or

3435.54 --> 3441.54
very different types of music

3439.2 --> 3443.339
depending on what type of deity you

3441.54 --> 3445.819
choose to be and what you're going to do

3443.339 --> 3445.819
right

3449.66 --> 3456.48
but not like too radically different

3453.3 --> 3458.1600000000003
it's like oh if you play this type of

3456.48 --> 3460.2
character it's going to be this music

3458.16 --> 3462.2999999999997
and it's very distinct because hey what

3460.2 --> 3463.3799999999997
if you don't like that music but you do

3462.3 --> 3466.6800000000003
like

3463.38 --> 3470.04
that type of character that's not very

3466.68 --> 3472.9199999999996
nice that's so it'd be cool if it could

3470.04 --> 3474.48
be like slight modification of the

3472.92 --> 3476.4
standard music that's going to roll out

3474.48 --> 3478.859
in those scenes

3476.4 --> 3480.78
a little bit like slight add-ons based

3478.859 --> 3483.619
on the diary type that you're playing

3480.78 --> 3483.619
right like that

3488.24 --> 3491.4799999999996
predictive text

3491.66 --> 3494.839
Baldur's Gate

3496.02 --> 3498.68
foreign

3499.72 --> 3502.89
[Music]

3548.48 --> 3554.52
right anyway

3551.52 --> 3557.24
it's just on my mind I'm working on it

3554.52 --> 3557.24
in my mind

3557.46 --> 3562.02
I mean this one's not gonna like fizzle

3560.099 --> 3565.52
permanently it's the same as the Matrix

3562.02 --> 3565.52
movie I had the same kind of

3566.4 --> 3570.1800000000003
this vision

3568.079 --> 3572.28
with that that's how it works with me I

3570.18 --> 3574.2
get just a vision and the vision never

3572.28 --> 3577.1600000000003
really goes away although the passion

3574.2 --> 3577.16
for it might go away

3577.319 --> 3581.18
and then it's just like sitting there

3585.119 --> 3588.98
but the funny thing is is that

3589.079 --> 3594.3590000000004
I've never really tried to fill in like

3592.14 --> 3596.5789999999997
what would the continuation of Baldur's

3594.359 --> 3600.24
Gate to be it's like yeah Beyond The

3596.579 --> 3603.3590000000004
Diary what and it I never really had

3600.24 --> 3606.299
that vision and now it's like yeah this

3603.359 --> 3608.22
is how it's gonna continue and well when

3606.299 --> 3610.319
that happened to me like what is it now

3608.22 --> 3612.839
a week ago or something that's the first

3610.319 --> 3615.66
time that idea has ever entered me

3612.839 --> 3621.0789999999997
the arrival of

3615.66 --> 3621.0789999999997
that thing that view that vision

3623.04 --> 3628.2799999999997
what

3624.78 --> 3628.28
d a t

3628.38 --> 3634.339
deity uh whatever deity deity

3641.46 --> 3644.66
it's not deity

3644.94 --> 3650.099
is it deity

3647.28 --> 3652.619
the [ __ ]

3650.099 --> 3656.119
I don't like that word anyway I always

3652.619 --> 3656.119
say deity I don't know why

3657.54 --> 3662.599
I guess it's deity I've heard other

3659.579 --> 3662.599
people say it like that

3677.22 --> 3680.7799999999997
yes it is just what

3688.76 --> 3693.5400000000004
deity

3690.54 --> 3696.48
it's ridiculous yeah I'm gonna say deity

3693.54 --> 3698.52
then I will say the English way

3696.48 --> 3701.099
or I'm gonna say deity I'm just gonna

3698.52 --> 3703.859
say [ __ ] deity and get on everybody's

3701.099 --> 3705.7200000000003
nerves uh insist on the mispronunciation

3703.859 --> 3707.22
because I've been saying it like that

3705.72 --> 3710.04
for

3707.22 --> 3712.2599999999998
over a decade

3710.04 --> 3715.2599999999998
because nobody ever gave a [ __ ] to

3712.26 --> 3718.2000000000003
correct me and so now that's ingrained

3715.26 --> 3720.5400000000004
so going to be very [ __ ] hard to get

3718.2 --> 3721.9199999999996
that out of my vernacular

3720.54 --> 3724.859
so

3721.92 --> 3727.4
right that's why every single time I say

3724.859 --> 3727.4
it like that

3731.53 --> 3734.6690000000003
[Music]

3736.2 --> 3742.2
right but excuse me for having some

3738.78 --> 3745.02
vowel rotatory issues with the English

3742.2 --> 3749.7799999999997
language which is literally like has

3745.02 --> 3752.94
every single vowel is rotated

3749.78 --> 3756.059
including the combination of vowels

3752.94 --> 3758.52
right I mean dude do you know how

3756.059 --> 3761.0400000000004
incredibly different English is from

3758.52 --> 3762.599
Dutch with every freaking vowel it's in

3761.04 --> 3766.819
unbelievable

3762.599 --> 3766.819
okay so excuse me

3768.87 --> 3772.0499999999997
[Music]

3772.5 --> 3777.059
but I mean if I'd be talking with

3775.38 --> 3779.579
somebody

3777.059 --> 3782.2200000000003
like online and they hear their voice

3779.579 --> 3785.1600000000003
and they'd say deity

3782.22 --> 3788.839
or even deity

3785.16 --> 3792.18
then I would stop seeing saying deity

3788.839 --> 3796.02
naturally and just say deity

3792.18 --> 3798.7799999999997
but when I'm just only me talking it's

3796.02 --> 3801.0
it just keeps slipping back into deity

3798.78 --> 3803.4
it just does

3801.0 --> 3806.64
I know it's annoying

3803.4 --> 3809.359
I guess maybe maybe you don't really

3806.64 --> 3809.359
give a [ __ ]

3820.74 --> 3826.5
oh [ __ ] [ __ ] why why why does that

3825.0 --> 3829.559
happen

3826.5 --> 3831.839
like oh yeah type something in and then

3829.559 --> 3834.3590000000004
my pointer wasn't in chat and then the

3831.839 --> 3837.54
whole freaking thing just rearranges

3834.359 --> 3840.2599999999998
itself I hated that that happens

3837.54 --> 3840.2599999999998
why would

3843.97 --> 3847.08
[Music]

3849.18 --> 3856.2799999999997
this

3851.22 --> 3856.2799999999997
so that's how I say it diet tea

3866.36 --> 3869.409
[Music]

3870.559 --> 3876.42
I speak English then better than you can

3873.359 --> 3879.48
speak Dutch yeah duh

3876.42 --> 3881.52
there's no English person out there that

3879.48 --> 3884.52
can speak Dutch

3881.52 --> 3887.52
without immediately immediately

3884.52 --> 3889.619
revealing that they are not Dutch and

3887.52 --> 3892.2
really desperately trying to talk Dutch

3889.619 --> 3895.02
like even foreigners that are like

3892.2 --> 3897.48
really good at Dutch

3895.02 --> 3898.98
you can absolutely hear that they're not

3897.48 --> 3902.22
Dutch

3898.98 --> 3904.619
even though they're really good at it

3902.22 --> 3906.839
because there's Dutch people that aren't

3904.619 --> 3909.599
very good at Dutch but you can

3906.839 --> 3910.98
absolutely hear that they're Dutch

3909.599 --> 3914.7000000000003
you see

3910.98 --> 3916.079
because of the pronunciation of

3914.7 --> 3918.4199999999996
everything

3916.079 --> 3921.54
that's what the Dutch get absolutely

3918.42 --> 3924.359
right every time

3921.54 --> 3928.88
and what foreigners that learn Dutch

3924.359 --> 3928.88
afterward just they just can't handle it

3931.46 --> 3937.16
oh what's so difficult about the word I

3934.68 --> 3937.16
mean it's only

3941.22 --> 3946.02
it's not that difficult

3943.559 --> 3948.559
I mean

3946.02 --> 3948.559
come on

3952.02 --> 3958.14

4086.66 --> 4092.02
blowing your nose about to spit on the

4089.059 --> 4094.8190000000004

[Music]

4121.16 --> 4124.66
blame it on Canada

4124.759 --> 4129.859
talking about which

4127.279 --> 4132.620000000001
man I was watching yesterday new South

4129.859 --> 4135.319
Park episode The Second One

4132.62 --> 4137.54
which was not as horrendous as that

4135.319 --> 4140.06
first one which was really [ __ ]

4137.54 --> 4141.859
annoying it wasn't funny the first one

4140.06 --> 4143.719
it was lame it was actually lame

4141.859 --> 4146.54
compared to the reality of it and that's

4143.719 --> 4149.2390000000005
bad bad South Park if your joke about

4146.54 --> 4154.5199999999995
something is Lamer than the actual

4149.239 --> 4156.199
reality then you fail bad right but that

4154.52 --> 4158.540000000001
second one was kind of funny it was

4156.199 --> 4161.239
really about

4158.54 --> 4164.299
the British nobility again in relation

4161.239 --> 4165.199
to Canada at first but it was really

4164.299 --> 4168.679
about

4165.199 --> 4171.259
what is it prince Andrew and his wife

4168.679 --> 4172.88
and what really making fun of them and I

4171.259 --> 4174.08
guess it's kind of maybe a little bit

4172.88 --> 4176.719
cheap

4174.08 --> 4180.4
but it was really freaking funny though

4176.719 --> 4180.4
I really did think it was funny

4181.759 --> 4186.259
and weird how they were basically

4183.5 --> 4188.239
portrayed as Canadian

4186.259 --> 4192.08
I mean they're British but they're like

4188.239 --> 4195.799999999999
shown as Canadians what do I think did I

4192.08 --> 4198.32
get it wrong no no they weren't

4195.8 --> 4201.1990000000005
I have to re-watch it I thought it was

4198.32 --> 4204.62
really funny actually

4201.199 --> 4206.9
we want privacy we want privacy then

4204.62 --> 4209.0599999999995
like getting really noisy and in

4206.9 --> 4212.179
everybody's face protesting about how

4209.06 --> 4215.080000000001
they want price that was funny I did

4212.179 --> 4215.08
think that was funny

4215.9 --> 4221.719
so yeah maybe South Park's not entirely

4218.84 --> 4223.64
lost just yet but that first episode

4221.719 --> 4227.5
from this new season was just the

4223.64 --> 4227.5
horrendous in my opinion

4253.1 --> 4256.58
all right

4254.38 --> 4259.0
anyway I hope you guys are enjoying

4256.58 --> 4259.0

4314.719 --> 4318.04
anxiety unfortunately

4319.179 --> 4326.2390000000005
but don't worry I don't actually have to

4323.06 --> 4328.76
do the voice work of the characters

4326.239 --> 4332.139999999999
I mean I could probably do like some

4328.76 --> 4332.14
weird figures or whatever

4332.78 --> 4336.259999999999
I could very easily like do goblins or

4335.36 --> 4339.159
whatever

4336.26 --> 4339.159000000001
that sort of thing

4339.5 --> 4345.4

I'm glad of your enthusiasm though but

4369.26 --> 4373.42

4481.64 --> 4486.02
this is with Family Guy it's very mixing

4483.92 --> 4488.84
I mean sometimes it's really funny and

4486.02 --> 4490.64
sometimes is really nauseating to me

4488.84 --> 4493.52
so

4490.64 --> 4495.14

4493.52 --> 4497.9800000000005
