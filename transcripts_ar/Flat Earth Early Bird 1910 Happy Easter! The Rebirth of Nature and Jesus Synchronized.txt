severely

malnourished but if you have it on the

typical side Taste of goat goat has this

1003.68 --> 1009.519
very or

1006.68 --> 1011.6389999999999
sheep they have this very weird oily

1009.519 --> 1014.399
side taste that is just that I

1011.639 --> 1017.199
personally don't really like I mean I

1014.399 --> 1020.6
could live with it but I don't really

1017.199 --> 1022.8389999999999
like it I like it less than fish

1020.6 --> 1027.3600000000001
actually I have a lot of

1022.839 --> 1031.1200000000001
dislikes concerning that kind of thing

1027.36 --> 1035.039
but yeah game is kind of like that

1031.12 --> 1037.12
too but it's just weird it's like

1035.039 --> 1039.679
something you pick up and like hey what

1037.12 --> 1042.1989999999998
is this H

1039.679 --> 1045.199
weird not

1042.199 --> 1045.199
particularly

1047.84 --> 1052.1599999999999
disgusting

1049.76 --> 1057.84
but yeah I had like wild

1052.16 --> 1062.4
deer and that is it is really nice if

1057.84 --> 1062.3999999999999
when properly in the right type of

1064.52 --> 1069.74
meal had that a few times like just a

1068.2 --> 1072.93
handful of times in my

1069.74 --> 1072.93
[Music]

1075.159 --> 1081.0
life goat can be very chewy

1079.44 --> 1083.8400000000001
I bet they

1081.0 --> 1086.159
can all depends on what type of goat it

1083.84 --> 1086.1589999999999
is

1090.799 --> 1095.12
though I have no idea what the food is

1093.559 --> 1097.96
like in

1095.12 --> 1101.6
Gambia it might have have might have

1097.96 --> 1101.6000000000001
something to do with that it was in

1102.08 --> 1107.76
Gambia PayPal up

1105.36 --> 1110.76
oh oh

1107.76 --> 1110.76

1112.99 --> 1117.009
[Music]

wow thank you I didn't expect that thank

1122.52 --> 1127.6
you very much fiber outs for the

1125.4 --> 1131.76
support that's

1127.6 --> 1131.76
great I can definitely use

1133.84 --> 1139.6
it but

1135.799 --> 1142.28
that's wasn't expecting that right away

1139.6 --> 1146.039
yeah thank you so much

1142.28 --> 1146.039
man nice Easter

1152.84 --> 1159.1589999999999
surprise what kind of fish is popular to

1155.6 --> 1163.0
eat where I am at

1159.159 --> 1165.64
uh I don't really know I'm not I'm

1163.0 --> 1169.039
really not into eating

1165.64 --> 1172.0800000000002
fish I like fish oil though like like

1169.039 --> 1175.08
I'm that is very important to me but I

1172.08 --> 1177.799
don't really like fish or the smell of

1175.08 --> 1179.799
fish but I think that

1177.799 --> 1182.72
traditionally very popular in the

1179.799 --> 1182.72
Netherlands is the

1184.039 --> 1187.039
Herring

1188.76 --> 1196.36
and other little

1191.919 --> 1200.679
fishies probably as well

1196.36 --> 1203.28
eel and that's pretty much where I

1200.679 --> 1207.88
stopped trying to figure remember the

1203.28 --> 1207.8799999999999
names of the fish sardines yeah

1217.12 --> 1223.6789999999999
sure if I would personally go for fish

1220.0 --> 1223.679
though I'd probably choose

1225.0 --> 1231.48
salmon like if I have to choose a fish

1228.799 --> 1231.48
I'll choose

1234.84 --> 1240.72
salmon I have stinky

1237.48 --> 1243.559
fish I have S

1240.72 --> 1245.799
storing uh well at a at a fish

1243.559 --> 1248.2
specialist I'm sure they do have those

[Music]

1597.52 --> 1603.12
right was a little weird

1600.08 --> 1605.72
yesterday like I had been subscribed to

1603.12 --> 1607.36
archaics because I was just kind of like

1605.72 --> 1611.08
looking into his

1607.36 --> 1614.84
stuff to see if I could find some

1611.08 --> 1615.84
information about the the N eclipse and

1614.84 --> 1619.08
all

1615.84 --> 1621.36
that and then he had some like live

1619.08 --> 1623.12
conference thing or whatever and I got

1621.36 --> 1626.279
in there and just shared a bunch of

1623.12 --> 1631.4399999999998
ideas and apparently they don't take too

1626.279 --> 1631.44
kindly to people that talk [ __ ] about

1633.32 --> 1636.72
sjws that was

1644.84 --> 1649.8799999999999
weird I mean there was literally like

1647.279 --> 1651.52
nobody even doing doing anything like on

1649.88 --> 1653.96
camera while that was

1651.52 --> 1657.399
happening and I got a time

1653.96 --> 1659.52
out like really long one too they didn't

1657.399 --> 1659.52
get

1659.559 --> 1667.559
it so either they're really anti flat

1662.96 --> 1670.8400000000001
earther or their anti sjw over

1667.559 --> 1670.84
there yeah

1677.12 --> 1683.799
really who Tim me I don't know but it's

1680.799 --> 1683.799
probably somebody with a

1684.039 --> 1690.32
wrench it didn't get to see you don't

1686.32 --> 1690.32
really get to see who timesed you

1692.279 --> 1695.84
out so

1698.039 --> 1706.399
yeah that's a bad sign let me tell you

1702.88 --> 1709.3600000000001
that what channels

1706.399 --> 1713.0
archaics really big time time conspiracy

1709.36 --> 1716.9189999999999
guy but I think he might be kind of a

1713.0 --> 1721.279
leftist he's the

1716.919 --> 1724.159
left and he is into like gatria but and

1721.279 --> 1724.159
fear porn a

1725.279 --> 1730.24
lot but I mean he is a big Channel and

1728.0 --> 1733.96
he does address topics and I just bump

1730.24 --> 1737.24
somebody recommended it to

1733.96 --> 1740.039
me yeah well not a lip [ __ ] it's like a

1737.24 --> 1740.039
Neo lip

1744.76 --> 1751.08
it's like a liberal who rejects the

1762.58 --> 1766.58
[Music]

1767.039 --> 1771.799

1775.84 --> 1782.12
these things and

1778.2 --> 1785.1200000000001
so neoliberal dude I I literally just

1782.12 --> 1786.9599999999998
made up that word it's just like yeah

1785.12 --> 1789.1999999999998
it's just something that happens to

1786.96 --> 1792.72
people they're like liberal but then

1789.2 --> 1796.0
they realize like no I'm not not part of

1792.72 --> 1797.039
that but then they still keep going with

1796.0 --> 1799.519
the

1797.039 --> 1801.72
habits

1799.519 --> 1805.08

1894.32 --> 1901.84
then I'll try to do it more

1897.12 --> 1905.6
tactful like like hey yeah those

1901.84 --> 1907.9599999999998
Rockets yeah the the propulsion of a

1905.6 --> 1910.32
rocket doesn't work in a vacuum because

1907.96 --> 1914.72
it has nothing to press on it'll just

1910.32 --> 1916.559
explode off in in space without creating

1914.72 --> 1920.2
any

1916.559 --> 1922.76
yeah any force on the rocket itself in

1920.2 --> 1925.919
order for it to keep moving other than

1922.76 --> 1928.24
any momentum it may have had like that

1925.919 --> 1928.24
kind of

1930.32 --> 1935.279
thing but I'm not just going like oh

1932.6 --> 1938.1589999999999
Earth is flat it's all fake it's so fake

1935.279 --> 1938.159

1982.24 --> 1986.76
translator is going to help you I think

1995.919 --> 2002.519
just I think just learning how to read

1998.88 --> 2002.519
and write would have probably helped

2006.399 --> 2012.9189999999999
better now right writing is probably

2008.919 --> 2012.919
reading is probably fine

2014.32 --> 2020.279
um Pencil Neck

2017.12 --> 2025.08
what what is going on

2020.279 --> 2028.0

2034.36 --> 2038.639

2048.159 --> 2051.7200000000003

better if you just kind of hang in the

2115.72 --> 2122.1189999999997

freaking website causes my computer to

2305.56 --> 2311.839
literally go off like

2308.2 --> 2315.48

2332.8 --> 2336.44
really interesting yes tiger bear yeah

2334.8 --> 2339.44
that's from Friday

2336.44 --> 2339.44
show

2339.72 --> 2346.52

2343.76 --> 2346.5200000000004
spiritually

2347.68 --> 2354.7999999999997
fascinating have not been there for a

2351.48 --> 2357.8
while Russian theater oh

2354.8 --> 2357.8
God

2360.4 --> 2369.92
uh Al agency maybe I mean

2366.359 --> 2374.52
I'm it could be led back

2369.92 --> 2376.52
to to either Ukraine or just the United

2374.52 --> 2380.0
States alphabet agency as should say

2376.52 --> 2381.119
it's kind of difficult to tell I'm sure

2380.0 --> 2384.44
the

2381.119 --> 2386.319
uh Russian investigators are going to

2384.44 --> 2389.96
figure it

2386.319 --> 2389.96
out they're very

2394.72 --> 2401.319
resourceful but I suspect that it is

2397.96 --> 2401.319
yeah actually the United

2410.359 --> 2417.0
States USA and Ukraine are well they

2413.24 --> 2417.0
they like to think they are

2420.98 --> 2424.51
[Music]

2426.319 --> 2429.319
yeah

2437.4 --> 2442.839
all right I'm going to get my coffee and

2438.88 --> 2442.839
hopefully I'm going to wake the freak

2456.24 --> 2459.24
up

2486.24 --> 2489.24
for

2509.76 --> 2514.8
but

2511.0 --> 2514.8
uh one thing I want to

2515.839 --> 2519.24
do is just

2520.64 --> 2526.319
just I want to just share with how happy

2524.04 --> 2529.319
I am

2526.319 --> 2533.04
actually with everything that I

2529.319 --> 2537.079
have I've gotten and I've achieved I

2533.04 --> 2539.4
guess with you guys and everything we've

2537.079 --> 2539.4
gone

2541.599 --> 2546.92
through and so not to be like oh I don't

2544.72 --> 2549.1189999999997
have this I don't have that but instead

2546.92 --> 2549.119
just

2549.319 --> 2554.5589999999997
yeah just in the line of March gladness

2552.2 --> 2558.9199999999996
which I thought was like a

2554.559 --> 2563.0
great idea from Owen

2558.92 --> 2565.88
Benjamin cuz I have been really feeling

2563.0 --> 2568.68
that so just look at everything that

2565.88 --> 2572.119
I've gotten and realize like how lucky I

2568.68 --> 2575.72
am still to have all those things and to

2572.119 --> 2575.7200000000003
be able to enjoy them and

2576.119 --> 2585.079
to not actually be

2580.28 --> 2589.119
stuck just like nature during the

2585.079 --> 2591.079
winter like it isn't actually stuck it's

2589.119 --> 2595.96
just

2591.079 --> 2595.96
preparing just building up for the

2598.72 --> 2603.68
spring and so everybody is potentially

2601.52 --> 2604.92
in that position everybody has ups and

2603.68 --> 2609.1189999999997
downs

2604.92 --> 2609.119
and hardships

2611.24 --> 2616.5589999999997
but

2612.92 --> 2619.079
somehow we always do get out of it

2616.559 --> 2622.7200000000003
unless you hold on to the

2619.079 --> 2625.7200000000003
hardships too much let you st stare

2622.72 --> 2625.72
yourself blind on

2627.52 --> 2632.16
them and I'm just really

2630.2 --> 2634.2
feeling very

2632.16 --> 2636.04
thankful for the things that have got

2634.2 --> 2639.04
the way that they've

2636.04 --> 2639.04
gone

2641.44 --> 2646.359
how much further I have personally come

2643.88 --> 2649.96
with just how I do things and how

2646.359 --> 2649.96
serious I take my own

2651.68 --> 2654.68
health

2655.119 --> 2663.559
and just the art of behavior in

2660.319 --> 2666.52
general I mean I've changed quite a lot

2663.559 --> 2668.599
compared to the previous decade I feel

2666.52 --> 2671.28
at least I mean maybe have not changed

2668.599 --> 2674.44
that much watching some shows back in

2671.28 --> 2677.6800000000003
like the last month sometimes I do get

2674.44 --> 2681.2000000000003
like super rude

2677.68 --> 2683.839
man but it's completely

2681.2 --> 2686.839
unintended I just get really rude with

2683.839 --> 2690.16
people just rude mouth not not thinking

2686.839 --> 2693.119
about like maybe that's actually kind of

2690.16 --> 2696.04
mean to say that I just get really rough

2693.119 --> 2698.4
but it is it comes out of

2696.04 --> 2703.04
nowhere

2698.4 --> 2706.88
when things heat up when I'm like

2703.04 --> 2709.0
really really focused and I'm like

2706.88 --> 2712.2400000000002
catching on to great ideas and then I

2709.0 --> 2715.92
just like can get just so rude to people

2712.24 --> 2718.68
all of a sudden and not like backstabby

2715.92 --> 2721.48
rude or anything not mean-spirited I

2718.68 --> 2725.0789999999997
just get really

2721.48 --> 2728.079
rude and that is kind of

2725.079 --> 2730.92
annoying still something to work

2728.079 --> 2734.8390000000004
on but it's like the intensity of the

2730.92 --> 2734.839
energy that really causes that to

2739.839 --> 2745.16
happen but other than that like I'm very

2742.4 --> 2746.88
satisfied with how I've changed my code

2745.16 --> 2749.68
of

2746.88 --> 2752.119
conduct don't allow myself to really get

2749.68 --> 2752.1189999999997
Angry

2753.52 --> 2757.72
Anymore also I've been thinking I do

2756.0 --> 2761.319
kind of

2757.72 --> 2766.16
Miss some aspects of what I was

2761.319 --> 2766.16
doing is that an apology

2767.319 --> 2772.359
no holy [ __ ] you've been waiting all the

2769.88 --> 2772.359
way for

2772.96 --> 2779.28
that holy [ __ ] Luke alcot you are a

2776.839 --> 2779.2799999999997
[ __ ]

2779.72 --> 2787.5589999999997
gamma you failed the

2783.28 --> 2790.4
test wow yeah no that was definitely not

2787.559 --> 2790.4
directed at

2792.24 --> 2797.52
you but uh very typical very

2798.64 --> 2803.7999999999997
typical guess the Easter Bunny had to

2800.96 --> 2803.8
pop up some

2807.48 --> 2812.44
point but

2810.28 --> 2816.44
um

2812.44 --> 2820.2400000000002
yeah it's just there I have to also talk

2816.44 --> 2822.68
a little bit about my time at fed and

2820.24 --> 2828.04
like what that all

2822.68 --> 2832.2799999999997
did and the amazing times I did have

2828.04 --> 2835.04
there it was like a highlevel

2832.28 --> 2838.92
activity playground like a

2835.04 --> 2843.44
school where I could like be active at a

2838.92 --> 2845.839
very high level at a yeah and I've never

2843.44 --> 2848.839
really had that before especially that

2845.839 --> 2848.839
long

2850.559 --> 2856.3190000000004
but really the whole problem was why I

2854.4 --> 2859.2000000000003
eventually left is

2856.319 --> 2863.24
like the group

2859.2 --> 2868.04
dynamics the way everybody adapts to the

2863.24 --> 2871.4799999999996
group there's like a group Spirit and

2868.04 --> 2875.839
and that group Spirit

2871.48 --> 2878.0
like is not I I can't really deal with

2875.839 --> 2881.0789999999997
it

2878.0 --> 2885.2
and I've had problems with

2881.079 --> 2887.76
it pretty much from the

2885.2 --> 2890.9199999999996
offset and but later like the group

2887.76 --> 2893.1600000000003
Spirit just became way more

2890.92 --> 2897.839
dominating and

2893.16 --> 2899.5589999999997
like I wouldn't even get real individual

2897.839 --> 2903.0789999999997
communication

2899.559 --> 2905.8390000000004
anymore it's like they would all be just

2903.079 --> 2908.28
longing to jump to the group Spirit

2905.839 --> 2911.24
approach and just appr approach me as a

2908.28 --> 2914.1600000000003
group again and like but it's an

2911.24 --> 2918.68
unwanted Dynamic it's something that I

2914.16 --> 2921.44
don't want I never wanted that I I deal

2918.68 --> 2924.52
terribly with

2921.44 --> 2929.52
it and it is literally it has at

2924.52 --> 2929.52
occasion been like an assault on my very

2932.2 --> 2937.8799999999997
senses

2934.4 --> 2939.599
wow did Nathan kick me

2937.88 --> 2942.88
uh

2939.599 --> 2942.88
no I

2949.09 --> 2954.76
[Music]

2950.76 --> 2955.92
left it's like FD is comprised of like

2954.76 --> 2958.7990000000004
amazing

2955.92 --> 2963.599
individuals but I feel that over the

2958.799 --> 2968.72
years a lot of that individuality

2963.599 --> 2968.7200000000003
Spirit has become lost

2972.559 --> 2977.079
you blame Neil well there's something to

2975.92 --> 2981.7200000000003
say for

2977.079 --> 2981.7200000000003
that but you can't just blame

2982.04 --> 2990.359
everybody the you can't just blame a

2985.319 --> 2990.359
group Spirit Dynamic on one

2990.4 --> 2995.64
person CU it's everybody that's allowing

2993.4 --> 2998.359
it to be the way it

2995.64 --> 3000.319
is

2998.359 --> 3003.96
I can't just say oh it's because of Neil

3000.319 --> 3006.04
no no it's it's more complicated it is

3003.96 --> 3008.599
how everybody's

3006.04 --> 3010.599
responded and I feel that in ways

3008.599 --> 3013.2000000000003
they've over

3010.599 --> 3017.599
adapted and when you over adapt you

3013.2 --> 3017.5989999999997
sacrifice things about your own

3019.599 --> 3028.599
person and I'm not going to do

3023.88 --> 3032.559
that yeah that's why at the end it was

3028.599 --> 3035.3590000000004
literally like being called to The Altar

3032.559 --> 3041.0
and like you have to sacrifice these

3035.359 --> 3043.48
things now and like no I'm not going

3041.0 --> 3046.04
to let me be

3043.48 --> 3047.799
abundantly clear about

3046.04 --> 3054.24
that

3047.799 --> 3054.24
and that caused basically

3055.64 --> 3059.2799999999997
hostility

3057.559 --> 3062.52
a spiritual

3059.28 --> 3064.52
hostility that's really

3062.52 --> 3069.44
complicated it's

3064.52 --> 3075.44
like it it caused a break the crystal

3069.44 --> 3075.44
cracked and from that point on like like

3076.119 --> 3082.6800000000003
I having attempt if I would have

3079.16 --> 3085.92
attempted to like REM merge with them

3082.68 --> 3088.44
would have been severely punishing on me

3085.92 --> 3091.44
I would have probably gotten serious

3088.44 --> 3096.2400000000002
brain damage from that because of how

3091.44 --> 3098.44
punishing it was I mean literally panic

3096.24 --> 3102.5589999999997
attacks

3098.44 --> 3102.559
hallucinations okay it's not a

3104.72 --> 3112.68
joke the group dynamic

3108.04 --> 3115.2
became like intolerable to me I couldn't

3112.68 --> 3118.359
endure it anymore to keep

3115.2 --> 3121.5989999999997
going which I have for a while I've

3118.359 --> 3124.44
endured it to keep going but I've G

3121.599 --> 3127.92
tried to give signs out to

3124.44 --> 3130.2400000000002
them like hey I don't want this don't do

3127.92 --> 3131.04
that like I mean it this is really bad

3130.24 --> 3134.72
for

3131.04 --> 3137.839
me or like I can't handle this like you

3134.72 --> 3139.48
guys go about really rough mouth in

3137.839 --> 3141.92
certain ways and that like that all

3139.48 --> 3145.559
seems to work fine for you well well

3141.92 --> 3148.599
guess what it does not work fine for me

3145.559 --> 3152.92
and they always ignored

3148.599 --> 3156.76
it it's like oh that's too bad well we

3152.92 --> 3156.76
can't be really deal with

3159.2 --> 3163.359
it

3160.92 --> 3165.2000000000003
Mafia come on here we go yeah don't

3163.359 --> 3169.2799999999997
exaggerate that

3165.2 --> 3171.5589999999997
[ __ ] it's not all Neil's fault the point

3169.28 --> 3175.44
is is that it

3171.559 --> 3179.96
was physically unhealthy for

3175.44 --> 3183.52
me I had to leave and since I have left

3179.96 --> 3185.839
I no longer have rage win

3183.52 --> 3187.92
impulses because I really do in

3185.839 --> 3189.68
retrospect think that a lot of my rage

3187.92 --> 3191.799
wi impulses

3189.68 --> 3193.5989999999997
came as a

3191.799 --> 3196.88
side

3193.599 --> 3199.28
burnoff from the pollutant the spiritual

3196.88 --> 3201.48
pollutants of having to endure things

3199.28 --> 3205.0400000000004
that I'm not

3201.48 --> 3208.72
really good at processing it was

3205.04 --> 3211.2799999999997
unhealthy for me and I had massive

3208.72 --> 3213.9599999999996
frustrations some of which were not as

3211.28 --> 3218.2400000000002
simple as like oh just this

3213.96 --> 3221.0
Behavior no it was the overall energy of

3218.24 --> 3224.52
it and I'm way too

3221.0 --> 3228.119
sensitive to to just go in there and

3224.52 --> 3231.28
come out of it

3228.119 --> 3233.319
untouched on the spirit level and so

3231.28 --> 3235.44
that had been happening for a long time

3233.319 --> 3238.599
and eventually it started wearing on me

3235.44 --> 3240.64
where you could say could argue that my

3238.599 --> 3246.0
subconscious literally

3240.64 --> 3246.0
created like pretty severe scary

3246.16 --> 3252.359
hallucinations just to try to convince

3249.319 --> 3252.359
me to get the hell

3256.559 --> 3262.119
out so because that is what happened

3260.599 --> 3265.6400000000003
scary

3262.119 --> 3268.359
things that are very likely not to be

3265.64 --> 3268.359
physically real

3273.599 --> 3278.6800000000003
thought you wasn't a show today there's

3275.119 --> 3282.04
a show every day that Gary do music if I

3278.68 --> 3285.44
don't do a show you'll see it you'll see

3282.04 --> 3287.88
it announced on Twitter and I'd be

3285.44 --> 3291.92
talking about it the day before that

3287.88 --> 3291.92
there isn't a show now there is a

3294.599 --> 3298.76
show Happy Easter to you

3296.46 --> 3301.2
[Music]

3298.76 --> 3306.119
yeah right

3301.2 --> 3309.1189999999997
so I just feel yeah cuz it's been kind

3306.119 --> 3312.079
of Weighing on me in a bit in a bit you

3309.119 --> 3315.319
got to realize like in ways it's like

3312.079 --> 3317.6800000000003
I've been married for 10

3315.319 --> 3320.359
years

3317.68 --> 3324.48
and it almost makes me a bit emotional

3320.359 --> 3324.48
but I really took it very

3324.92 --> 3331.6800000000003
serious like

3327.16 --> 3331.68
I really was one of those

3332.0 --> 3339.039
guys and I like stood for that I try to

3336.079 --> 3343.1600000000003
make it a better

3339.039 --> 3346.039
place for their all of their protection

3343.16 --> 3350.839
too cuz there's a lot of like

3346.039 --> 3350.8390000000004
intellectual power going around in that

3354.96 --> 3360.559
group by

3356.92 --> 3364.37
NE wow fiber o That's so

3360.559 --> 3366.119
typical or teret yeah

3364.37 --> 3370.319
[Music]

3366.119 --> 3370.319
yeah it's crazy out

3372.359 --> 3378.0789999999997
there it really is it's crazy out

3379.84 --> 3383.07
[Music]

3385.24 --> 3391.7599999999998
there yeah here we go again but my point

3388.76 --> 3393.7990000000004
is you can't just blame it all on one

3391.76 --> 3397.88
individual yeah if

3393.799 --> 3402.319
anything I'd consider Neil or teret

3397.88 --> 3404.52
being a part of it as a symptom not as a

3402.319 --> 3406.52
cause I'm going to approach this with

3404.52 --> 3409.28
terrain

3406.52 --> 3413.25
Theory

3409.28 --> 3415.2400000000002
okay it's a symptom not the

3413.25 --> 3418.24
[Music]

3415.24 --> 3418.24
cause

3424.559 --> 3429.52
you like to poke at yeah well he does

3426.52 --> 3432.599
not like to be poked at fiber out so you

3429.52 --> 3432.599
kind of asked for it

3438.079 --> 3444.7200000000003
then interesting approach you like it

3440.799 --> 3448.68
yeah because Neil is a sympton he's

3444.72 --> 3452.7599999999998
there because Neil is is naturally

3448.68 --> 3455.64
good to being a cog within the group

3452.76 --> 3457.92
Spirit he has no limits in how much

3455.64 --> 3461.16
humiliation he will take for the group

3457.92 --> 3463.88
dynamic but it's also like really like

3461.16 --> 3467.1189999999997
oh don't you dare step out of line

3463.88 --> 3471.88
like Neil is all about the group

3467.119 --> 3474.76
dynamic he excels at that

3471.88 --> 3478.96
part of the social

3474.76 --> 3478.96
connection I do exactly the

3479.079 --> 3484.319
opposite for me group dynamic is

3481.799 --> 3486.72
damaging it's damaging to my

3484.319 --> 3490.319
individuality always has been I'm like

3486.72 --> 3492.2799999999997
more vulnerable to it so I have to be

3490.319 --> 3495.2799999999997
very careful what

3492.28 --> 3499.88
groups I mix

3495.28 --> 3503.28
with and fed from this offset was kind

3499.88 --> 3507.599
of a risk for me but a risk I was

3503.28 --> 3511.92
absolutely willing to take because just

3507.599 --> 3514.4
amazing people in there still are and

3511.92 --> 3514.4
just

3514.64 --> 3521.799
like once there is a a

3518.119 --> 3523.319
mission the way we were able to work

3521.799 --> 3525.16
together

3523.319 --> 3527.88
intellectually was literally

3525.16 --> 3531.52
unparalleled I've never seen

3527.88 --> 3538.039
brainstorming on that level ever like

3531.52 --> 3538.0389999999998
ever out there it was absolutely amazing

3538.92 --> 3544.28
but in

3540.16 --> 3549.839
ways the research has run

3544.28 --> 3549.8390000000004
out the development is part is

3551.359 --> 3557.2
done I mean there's still stuff out

3553.96 --> 3559.2
there but really in the big lines the

3557.2 --> 3563.2
development is just

3559.2 --> 3565.0389999999998
done now All That Remains is things well

3563.2 --> 3566.799
that I

3565.039 --> 3570.4
do

3566.799 --> 3571.92
like speculate about how it could be

3570.4 --> 3574.88
what these things could be that are out

3571.92 --> 3577.16
of our reach try to figure out the the

3574.88 --> 3581.839
the mysterious nature of

3577.16 --> 3585.1189999999997
this of the phenomena in our

3581.839 --> 3590.2
realm but the group doesn't really seem

3585.119 --> 3594.359
to want to do that Nathan instead has

3590.2 --> 3597.52
like chosen a direction for the entire

3594.359 --> 3601.2
show to instead

3597.52 --> 3604.24
go and be more

3601.2 --> 3608.16
competitive and polarized against the

3604.24 --> 3610.4799999999996
opposition and wisely use psychology to

3608.16 --> 3613.3999999999996
do it

3610.48 --> 3618.039
though but

3613.4 --> 3621.48
still that's going to eventually not

3618.039 --> 3623.8390000000004
work because you can't use psychology

3621.48 --> 3626.16
you can't perfect a weapon within

3623.839 --> 3629.52
psychology if you're going to be

3626.16 --> 3632.92
polarized while doing

3629.52 --> 3635.559
it psychology only works if you're

3632.92 --> 3637.76
balanced if you're not polarized because

3635.559 --> 3642.119
you need to be able to

3637.76 --> 3646.3590000000004
see both sides of a conflict neutrally

3642.119 --> 3646.359
to truly understand what is

3649.599 --> 3657.7200000000003
happening that is part of the reason why

3653.079 --> 3661.44
I have Ballwin why I had Ballwin why I

3657.72 --> 3666.16
insisted that we give the the opponent

3661.44 --> 3671.599
some lean way and some room to attain

3666.16 --> 3674.48
neutrality to get true Insight but I was

3671.599 --> 3677.28
punished for that and eventually they

3674.48 --> 3681.52
they try to make me sacrifice BN at the

3677.28 --> 3685.28
altar and I'm like this is not only bad

3681.52 --> 3687.319
for me and like like it feels like a

3685.28 --> 3692.52
personal ATT attack on something that is

3687.319 --> 3696.0389999999998
like mine my own personal contribution

3692.52 --> 3698.64
uniquely it is also bad it's a bad

3696.039 --> 3702.0
Direction

3698.64 --> 3706.8799999999997
decision captains taken a course with

3702.0 --> 3706.88
the ship where I ain't willing to

3713.68 --> 3720.279
follow but it has been

3716.76 --> 3723.4
terrible and bizarre and scary in a

3720.279 --> 3725.64
way because it's like yeah I've been

3723.4 --> 3728.2400000000002
with these guys on the ship for 10 years

3725.64 --> 3731.72
and suddenly it's like I can't I have to

3728.24 --> 3734.24
go I have to go I must go like I feel

3731.72 --> 3737.0389999999998
like I'm going to get sick and die if I

3734.24 --> 3740.5989999999997
stay I have to go starting to

3737.039 --> 3740.599
hallucinate this is

3741.76 --> 3750.599
bad I need to get these limes now okay

3745.92 --> 3750.599
can't keep going on so

3750.799 --> 3759.72
I I just like yeah fashion together a

3756.48 --> 3763.92
tugboat got some Roars

3759.72 --> 3766.64
and just went off to the to the closest

3763.92 --> 3768.7200000000003
island

3766.64 --> 3770.839
metaphorically and I'm still there now

3768.72 --> 3777.839
and it's working just

3770.839 --> 3777.839
great like I I did the right thing pal

3777.92 --> 3783.599
but it is still like I do miss it in

3780.44 --> 3783.599
ways it's just

3784.96 --> 3792.0
that the powers of the

3788.88 --> 3797.279
individuals they're still there but it's

3792.0 --> 3800.839
it's all webbed over by the group Spirit

3797.279 --> 3803.68
Dynamics you can't access it anymore I

3800.839 --> 3808.68
feel like they can't properly access it

3803.68 --> 3811.839
anymore but I might be to a degree

3808.68 --> 3815.24
incorrect it's just that what I expect

3811.839 --> 3820.0789999999997
to be able to do with the group dynamic

3815.24 --> 3823.0789999999997
with with the guys and just giving

3820.079 --> 3824.319
directions with ideas like I don't feel

3823.079 --> 3826.6400000000003
like

3824.319 --> 3831.0389999999998
that's they're willing to do that

3826.64 --> 3836.1189999999997
anymore at first they walk the blank at

3831.039 --> 3838.5200000000004
first they like me giving them some

3836.119 --> 3843.1600000000003
unexpected directions some pointers like

3838.52 --> 3845.64
hey see that look at this in between and

3843.16 --> 3848.24
they appreciate it they would in the

3845.64 --> 3850.92
development stage they very much

3848.24 --> 3850.9199999999996
appreciated

3851.2 --> 3858.3999999999996
it but now that they're just more about

3855.119 --> 3860.0
psychological combat they don't seem to

3858.4 --> 3863.359
appreciate it

3860.0 --> 3866.359
anymore or at least that's it it's kind

3863.359 --> 3869.359
of hard to tell like it's kind of weird

3866.359 --> 3871.279
I'm talking about them like I just been

3869.359 --> 3874.5989999999997
watching it or something but I'm still

3871.279 --> 3879.72
going off the way I left it all off I

3874.599 --> 3883.4
mean I haven't watched fed like at all

3879.72 --> 3883.3999999999996
for how long has it

3885.039 --> 3893.079
been one and a half month or

3889.039 --> 3897.6400000000003
something it's been way longer than than

3893.079 --> 3897.6400000000003
it yeah than I thought

3897.799 --> 3900.079
hello

3900.48 --> 3903.88
clear what are you

3917.96 --> 3923.2
talking all right chosen Direction

3920.72 --> 3925.279
wasn't M anymore yeah and I'm I wasn't

3923.2 --> 3926.72
going to like reduce myself to just

3925.279 --> 3929.24
being

3926.72 --> 3929.24
one of the

3932.559 --> 3938.119
Shipmates this

3934.48 --> 3941.0
not I I'm not going to settle for that I

3938.119 --> 3944.48
got too much I still have things to

3941.0 --> 3944.48
develop lots of

3945.88 --> 3950.279
things and they weren't going to give me

3948.559 --> 3954.119
that

3950.279 --> 3954.119
room so I had to take

3954.64 --> 3957.64
it

3967.96 --> 3971.319
right so yeah that's a little bit been

3969.88 --> 3973.4
on my

3971.319 --> 3977.7599999999998
mind

3973.4 --> 3977.76
just last night thinking about

3978.21 --> 3981.34
[Music]

3983.079 --> 3989.8390000000004
that but I mean guys I I cannot

3985.96 --> 3992.64
emphasize enough how serious it

3989.839 --> 3993.72
was how serious the pressure actually

3992.64 --> 3996.359
was on

3993.72 --> 3998.839
me I

3996.359 --> 4000.5589999999997
mean I

3998.839 --> 4003.16
was

4000.559 --> 4005.599
literally literally this is not like

4003.16 --> 4009.3999999999996
metaphorically or just a figure of

4005.599 --> 4009.4
speech literally

4009.599 --> 4013.3590000000004
hallucinating terrifying

4014.52 --> 4019.799
things and some of

4017.72 --> 4022.48
you know

4019.799 --> 4024.7599999999998
exactly what I'm talking about because I

4022.48 --> 4026.92
talked to you personally about it in a

4024.76 --> 4029.44
time where I was literally having panic

4026.92 --> 4029.44
attacks and

4029.839 --> 4033.5589999999997
everything it's really

4038.559 --> 4043.799
bizarre hope 10th is okay yeah he's

4041.2 --> 4043.799
still out

4044.039 --> 4048.3190000000004
there caring for his wife I

4057.48 --> 4063.72
think but I do miss T man a bit yeah I

4061.72 --> 4067.68
mean he was annoying at

4063.72 --> 4071.0
times but he was also incredibly

4067.68 --> 4071.0
gracious at other

4074.44 --> 4079.279
times

4076.72 --> 4082.3999999999996
and when he dropped out the group did

4079.279 --> 4082.4
lose like a bit of

4082.599 --> 4090.7200000000003
symmetry as R wanted

4086.839 --> 4092.599
oh oh my God all these people oh you

4090.72 --> 4097.759
feel the

4092.599 --> 4103.359
need the need to discredit them

4097.759 --> 4103.359
oh oh look at how terrible they were

4104.44 --> 4107.44
oh

4114.979 --> 4118.039000000001
[Music]

4120.2 --> 4126.539
[Music]

4126.92 --> 4131.64
yeah

4128.279 --> 4134.4400000000005
symmetrical I did consider him to be a

4131.64 --> 4136.359
proper Christian leader type

4134.44 --> 4138.919999999999
representative

4136.359 --> 4142.279
of all the Christians out there that I

4138.92 --> 4145.64
have met that are like really Christian

4142.279 --> 4150.2390000000005
he was an actual

4145.64 --> 4150.2390000000005
worthy priest like figure in

4151.239 --> 4155.12
it and this sounds kind of weird it

4153.839 --> 4159.159
would

4155.12 --> 4161.96
be like and we all know there's others

4159.159 --> 4166.08
he was actually somebody that I could

4161.96 --> 4168.319
really respect like as an eclectic with

4166.08 --> 4168.3189999999995
my

4168.4 --> 4174.92
ways he would actually give recognition

4171.719 --> 4177.04
to what I what I was trying and that it

4174.92 --> 4180.08
was

4177.04 --> 4183.0
actually with Christ in mind and he's

4180.08 --> 4186.199
been like the only one that's actually

4183.0 --> 4189.04
been able to do that and mean

4186.199 --> 4193.199
it and when he dropped

4189.04 --> 4197.32
out it's like the the Christian side of

4193.199 --> 4197.32
it all became more

4197.96 --> 4206.04
cultish more like medieval Catholic

4202.52 --> 4208.64
priests and I really don't like

4206.04 --> 4211.48
that and when 10th man dropped out it's

4208.64 --> 4211.4800000000005
like it became

4214.0 --> 4221.8
unbalanced like to

4218.4 --> 4224.32
develop the religious discussion he

4221.8 --> 4227.320000000001
needed to be

4224.32 --> 4227.32
there

4228.76 --> 4235.56
and since he dropped out it just became

4231.6 --> 4235.56
asymmetrical and just doesn't work

4236.04 --> 4243.159
anymore yeah you could call it Mafia

4238.8 --> 4246.320000000001
Christians but in a way it is I am very

4243.159 --> 4249.839999999999
sorry I I literally am sorry not as a

4246.32 --> 4251.88
symbolic apology I'm very sorry that

4249.84 --> 4255.92
that

4251.88 --> 4258.6
happened because it has that also as a

4255.92 --> 4262.28
separate trait of the group

4258.6 --> 4264.2390000000005
dynamic that compartment has become

4262.28 --> 4269.5599999999995
polluted in that

4264.239 --> 4274.36
way it's like a rigidity within a sub

4269.56 --> 4274.360000000001
group dynamic in the whole group

4275.28 --> 4281.92
dynamic which made the whole thing more

4278.28 --> 4284.239
rigid more inflexible more

4281.92 --> 4286.88
intolerant and it's

4284.239 --> 4291.0
like Ryan has been quiet for a while

4286.88 --> 4295.159000000001
yeah well how the hell could he

4291.0 --> 4298.679
now roll out his more controversial

4295.159 --> 4302.0
non-Christian rooted ideas in the face

4298.679 --> 4304.12
of all this it'll just get [ __ ] on

4302.0 --> 4309.679
immediately by the Christian side and

4304.12 --> 4309.679
then like nothing no consideration no

4314.239 --> 4317.239
development

4323.76 --> 4329.320000000001
yeah it's

4326.28 --> 4331.44
sad and it's also sad because like

4329.32 --> 4334.32
because I'm not in there anymore but it

4331.44 --> 4336.28
wouldn't have worked even if I had

4334.32 --> 4340.84
stayed this

4336.28 --> 4343.84
development of alternative Christianity

4340.84 --> 4343.84
or

4344.159 --> 4348.5599999999995
spirituality

4346.159 --> 4352.679
there was so many things that are like

4348.56 --> 4356.6
hanging in there hanging in there ideas

4352.679 --> 4360.92
ideas that I still personally hold on

4356.6 --> 4363.56
to like for example I truly believe

4360.92 --> 4365.84
Jesus Christ was a

4363.56 --> 4369.280000000001
ginger and that it has something to do

4365.84 --> 4373.84
with Southern France and that I think

4369.28 --> 4376.679
that there yeah might have been a a

4373.84 --> 4381.159000000001
transplant in the locations within the

4376.679 --> 4381.159
crafting of the story of the

4384.08 --> 4387.5599999999995
Bible that kind of

4389.92 --> 4395.04
thing right

4392.0 --> 4397.56
and now it's like

4395.04 --> 4400.239
yeah it's just hanging in there in the

4397.56 --> 4407.120000000001
background it's like what do we

4400.239 --> 4407.12
do to develop that can't really

4420.56 --> 4428.719
yeah F roads no that's interesting that

4423.159 --> 4432.48
you'd say that but 10th Man was very

4428.719 --> 4432.4800000000005
adult about

4432.6 --> 4441.120000000001
Christianity which is a very important

4436.04 --> 4442.199
trait to have to be adult and neutral

4441.12 --> 4445.44
about

4442.199 --> 4449.12
it being able to to take some

4445.44 --> 4451.759999999999
punches because of rowdiness from other

4449.12 --> 4456.84
people's positions which is more like to

4451.76 --> 4456.84
be a fighter for it a fighter for a

4464.04 --> 4467.04
side

4482.4 --> 4486.48
okay

4483.8 --> 4489.56
clutch that yeah there's all kinds of

4486.48 --> 4489.5599999999995
interesting ideas

4490.88 --> 4495.8
and I mean history's effectively been

4494.4 --> 4497.879999999999
completely

4495.8 --> 4501.8
written inside

4497.88 --> 4504.92
out like within our grandparents

4501.8 --> 4507.320000000001
lifetimes if you can't believe that yeah

4504.92 --> 4509.84
history's been like completely Rewritten

4507.32 --> 4513.5199999999995
within our grandparents

4509.84 --> 4513.52
lifetimes right under our

4514.0 --> 4521.719
noses and people have adapted to that

4518.199 --> 4524.719
story I mean and that's that close to us

4521.719 --> 4527.04
okay so if something that close to us

4524.719 --> 4529.4
with in time has been that dramatically

4527.04 --> 4531.719
altered and we all bought

4529.4 --> 4535.44
it what

4531.719 --> 4537.8
about hundreds or a thousand years

4535.44 --> 4541.08
before

4537.8 --> 4546.400000000001
that why would you assume that all

4541.08 --> 4548.719
that has not undergone similar

4546.4 --> 4552.04
alterations you

4548.719 --> 4556.92
know when something that close to us has

4552.04 --> 4556.92
that dramatically been changed

4557.29 --> 4563.47
[Music]

4563.679 --> 4567.159
right and then there's people that are

4565.56 --> 4569.120000000001
going to get all black pill about it

4567.159 --> 4572.0
like oh so that means the Bible's fake

4569.12 --> 4575.76
and then oh it's all wrong and it's evil

4572.0 --> 4578.52
like no no now the thing

4575.76 --> 4583.92
is you shall know them by their fruits

4578.52 --> 4585.639
you shall know the value and the

4583.92 --> 4589.88
truth

4585.639 --> 4593.639
of people's words when you hear

4589.88 --> 4596.52
them and Jesus Christ and what he says

4593.639 --> 4599.52
in the Bible is

4596.52 --> 4599.52
unmistakably

4600.32 --> 4606.92
valuable like no matter the context no

4603.96 --> 4609.679
matter if everything that surrounds him

4606.92 --> 4613.88
is completely switched out into

4609.679 --> 4615.639
something else you know that no matter

4613.88 --> 4620.2390000000005
what you put there

4615.639 --> 4622.2390000000005
what he's saying holds value will apply

4620.239 --> 4624.32
and that's the whole Magic of of

4622.239 --> 4628.5199999999995
Christ's teachings it's like no it

4624.32 --> 4628.5199999999995
doesn't matter what he's surrounded

4628.6 --> 4637.320000000001
with it always works that's the magical

4632.639 --> 4640.400000000001
thing about it and so I believe every

4637.32 --> 4643.08
time people reference the Bible and they

4640.4 --> 4646.759999999999
say they have certain ideas about how it

4643.08 --> 4651.199
is I always listen to like did did Jesus

4646.76 --> 4654.76
say that oh oh it was the other ones

4651.199 --> 4659.599999999999
that said that like Paul or some other

4654.76 --> 4663.4400000000005
Apostle or John or okay well every time

4659.6 --> 4668.320000000001
another person is mentioned there I

4663.44 --> 4670.44
immediately like alarm alarm take this

4668.32 --> 4672.759999999999
with a grain of Sal yeah this might this

4670.44 --> 4675.638999999999
is like side wisdom but if you're going

4672.76 --> 4679.88
to like base your entire Foundation

4675.639 --> 4683.8
understanding on this you got a problem

4679.88 --> 4686.84
because those people aren't Jesus

4683.8 --> 4690.0
and everything that is surrounding his

4686.84 --> 4692.4400000000005
words could have been altered in ways

4690.0 --> 4696.239
maybe even placed there specifically to

4692.44 --> 4696.239
distract you away from Christ's

4703.52 --> 4710.719
teachings right that sense I really do

4706.76 --> 4713.52
take Jesus's words as the words of God

4710.719 --> 4717.0
it's like if it this is going to be

4713.52 --> 4720.4400000000005
funny and ironic right we all know the

4717.0 --> 4724.12
the finan saying if it disagrees with

4720.44 --> 4726.199
experiment it's wrong very famous saying

4724.12 --> 4730.48
very true within

4726.199 --> 4735.12
physics well here's here I go if it

4730.48 --> 4737.0
disagrees with Jesus Christ it's wrong

4735.12 --> 4741.44
[Music]

4737.0 --> 4743.6
yeah as another side of it yeah so it's

4741.44 --> 4746.719
like oh well this person in the Bible

4743.6 --> 4753.159000000001
said this and that and like oh yeah oh

4746.719 --> 4755.639
really so does that comport with the

4753.159 --> 4758.4
rudimentary words of what Jesus Christ

4755.639 --> 4761.88
says like if you only study Jesus's

4758.4 --> 4764.08
words is that the

4761.88 --> 4766.04
direction you would develop your

4764.08 --> 4768.04
insights

4766.04 --> 4770.76
towards would you come to that

4768.04 --> 4773.08
conclusion that the other side person

4770.76 --> 4777.360000000001
came to

4773.08 --> 4777.36
yeah and that's how I take

4784.56 --> 4793.639
it but Christians a lot of them just

4789.84 --> 4796.4400000000005
think just anything in the Bible can

4793.639 --> 4798.84
just be taken as truth even though if

4796.44 --> 4802.36
you just all take that in you'll find

4798.84 --> 4806.08
yourself to be distracted away

4802.36 --> 4810.199
massively from the actual core

4806.08 --> 4814.32
teachings of Jesus and the

4810.199 --> 4817.678999999999
things that he actually still left

4814.32 --> 4821.239
open that's right Jesus left certain

4817.679 --> 4823.639
things open left open a

4821.239 --> 4826.638999999999
dynamic and a

4823.639 --> 4826.639
promise

4830.84 --> 4836.1990000000005
like a promise of there shall be those

4834.04 --> 4839.76
that I'm paraphrasing there shall be

4836.199 --> 4841.259999999999
those that will do things like I have

4839.76 --> 4844.400000000001
and

4841.26 --> 4847.84
[Music]

4844.4 --> 4851.32
more everybody's always concerned with

4847.84 --> 4854.400000000001
like trying to pin down everything about

4851.32 --> 4857.199
Jesus so that he is fullblown contained

4854.4 --> 4860.839999999999
and that you have like from his sayings

4857.199 --> 4862.599999999999
no more conceivable mistakes no more

4860.84 --> 4865.08
Dynamic that everything is like

4862.6 --> 4867.56
perfectly rigid like he's just part of

4865.08 --> 4870.76
the universal pattern of everything and

4867.56 --> 4870.76
there's no Dynamics

4872.28 --> 4878.8
left which is very

4875.239 --> 4882.839999999999
weird to do because by doing that you

4878.8 --> 4886.679
almost like deny him free

4882.84 --> 4889.4800000000005
will or of those in the future if

4886.679 --> 4892.08
there's no more interpretation left

4889.48 --> 4895.879999999999
about anything he's saying

4892.08 --> 4898.239
then there's no more Dynamic

4895.88 --> 4900.96
left in

4898.239 --> 4902.759999999999
doing there's then only one very

4900.96 --> 4905.639
specific way you can interpret

4902.76 --> 4905.639
everything and that's

4910.52 --> 4916.76
it and a lot of these Christians and

4914.199 --> 4919.638999999999
what followed up have like been

4916.76 --> 4922.4400000000005
attempting to do just that instead of

4919.639 --> 4925.719
like what about the lingo that Jesus was

4922.44 --> 4928.638999999999
using what about the esoteric dynamics

4925.719 --> 4931.4800000000005
of his time that he was trying to apply

4928.639 --> 4934.4800000000005
in his statements because Jesus Christ

4931.48 --> 4939.08
even in the Bible is like obviously

4934.48 --> 4943.638999999999
blatantly obviously talking esoteric

4939.08 --> 4945.639
symbols metaphors like blatantly obvious

4943.639 --> 4947.639
at times

4945.639 --> 4949.4800000000005
and other times he's

4947.639 --> 4953.92
like

4949.48 --> 4953.919999999999
very very down to earth very

4957.6 --> 4963.6
literal but the structures that he's

4960.96 --> 4968.52
using they

4963.6 --> 4969.56
are derived from esoteric knowledge of

4968.52 --> 4972.92
that

4969.56 --> 4975.76
time and proof that he is a master of

4972.92 --> 4980.92
his time with all

4975.76 --> 4985.400000000001
that cuz he's rolling out insights and

4980.92 --> 4985.4
wisdoms that apply

4995.52 --> 5001.88
always but a lot of things that are said

4999.28 --> 5005.4
about Jesus even in the Bible by other

5001.88 --> 5007.92
people are not compatible with this

5005.4 --> 5007.92
perfect

5008.36 --> 5013.48
Dynamic the perfect Dynamic of Jesus's

5016.44 --> 5021.678999999999
wisdom and a lot of people out there

5019.32 --> 5024.159
Christians just don't seem to realize

5021.679 --> 5024.159
that about

5026.199 --> 5032.638999999999
it keep trying to pin down Jesus's power

5030.639 --> 5036.88
to completely contain

5032.639 --> 5036.88
it so there's no more more open

5039.639 --> 5048.96
ends but in doing that they

5043.92 --> 5049.78
like try to destroy the fractal Dynamic

5048.96 --> 5052.92
of

5049.78 --> 5052.92
[Music]

5062.88 --> 5068.76
it it's complicated it's very

5065.84 --> 5072.4800000000005
psychological in a

5068.76 --> 5072.4800000000005
way right so

5074.159 --> 5079.96
yeah some of that is on my mind may may

5076.96 --> 5082.32
be appropriate that I think about Jesus

5079.96 --> 5082.32
on

5091.08 --> 5094.92
Easter Jesus himself said to listen to

5093.96 --> 5098.08
the apost

5094.92 --> 5098.08
yeah sure listen to

5104.159 --> 5110.0
them why would he say not to listen to

5107.04 --> 5112.239
them but does that mean that they are

5110.0 --> 5112.239
going

5114.199 --> 5117.199
to

5118.28 --> 5122.5599999999995
surpass Jesus's

5123.32 --> 5129.84
wisdom

5125.04 --> 5129.84
has Jesus been corrected by his

5129.96 --> 5135.119
Apostles and then admitted to it bord

5139.719 --> 5143.84
boy yeah and Paul wasn't an

5144.08 --> 5152.8
apostle whoever hears you hears me yeah

5148.96 --> 5152.8
well he's probably referring to his

5153.239 --> 5156.239
teachings

5157.56 --> 5160.96
like that sounds like an esoteric

5159.32 --> 5163.44
statement right

5160.96 --> 5167.119
there not

5163.44 --> 5167.119
literal if you know what I

5171.56 --> 5177.84
mean and it's also kind of risky that he

5174.36 --> 5181.44
would give that kind of authority

5177.84 --> 5181.4400000000005
out to other

5183.239 --> 5187.678999999999
people

5184.76 --> 5190.56
but you could argue if he knew that he

5187.679 --> 5192.56
was going to die at some point he might

5190.56 --> 5195.360000000001
have not felt any

5192.56 --> 5196.360000000001
choice and he was going to have to give

5195.36 --> 5200.44
the

5196.36 --> 5202.759999999999
authority Spiritual Authority share it

5200.44 --> 5202.759999999999
give it

5205.6 --> 5211.400000000001
away but that's just a

5209.32 --> 5213.88
consideration I'm pretty damn sure

5211.4 --> 5216.239
borders boy that Jesus didn't mean that

5213.88 --> 5216.2390000000005
liter

5217.29 --> 5220.5289999999995
[Music]

5220.6 --> 5225.92
yeah that's right teach them everything

5223.84 --> 5230.28
I have commanded

5225.92 --> 5233.56
you so that means not the ideas that you

5230.28 --> 5234.5599999999995
came up with in response to what I've

5233.56 --> 5238.080000000001
taught

5234.56 --> 5241.2390000000005
you very when they say commanded you

5238.08 --> 5243.119
yeah that sounds extremely specific

5241.239 --> 5246.119
doesn't

5243.119 --> 5246.119
it

5256.719 --> 5263.719
it's basically saying go teach the

5259.679 --> 5263.719
Nations my

5268.88 --> 5273.04
methods see how specific that

5273.119 --> 5276.119
is

5280.08 --> 5283.17
[Music]

5310.239 --> 5315.32
I mean could you interpret go into all

5313.159 --> 5317.5599999999995
nations and teach them everything I've

5315.32 --> 5321.159
commanded you could you interpret that

5317.56 --> 5323.639
as go into other nations and teach them

5321.159 --> 5327.719
that Jesus Christ is

5323.639 --> 5331.159000000001
God could could you see

5327.719 --> 5331.159
that in that

5333.04 --> 5339.56
statement

5334.96 --> 5343.4800000000005
did Jesus teach his Apostles that he is

5339.56 --> 5343.4800000000005
God that that is part of

5354.159 --> 5361.04
it or did he simply teach everybody how

5358.08 --> 5361.04
to be with

5361.56 --> 5366.2390000000005
God if you do these things then you

5364.36 --> 5369.759999999999
shall be with

5366.239 --> 5369.759999999999
God close to

5370.09 --> 5380.639
[Music]

5376.36 --> 5380.639
him hey man goth good to see

5389.84 --> 5397.719
you right I love it when anybody

5393.04 --> 5401.199
quotes Jesus for me when they do

5397.719 --> 5402.56
that because there's just so much power

5401.199 --> 5406.239
in his

5402.56 --> 5410.080000000001
words especially when a context of any

5406.239 --> 5410.08
sort is attempted to being

5411.28 --> 5417.32
applied every time Jesus says anything

5413.8 --> 5420.4400000000005
you can always use the Dynamics of it to

5417.32 --> 5420.44
take it into a good

5421.28 --> 5425.96
direction Hey Arthur be flat good see

5423.719 --> 5425.96
you

5434.88 --> 5442.52
yes that's right AR FL yeah I am the way

5439.0 --> 5446.44
the truth and the life no one comes into

5442.52 --> 5449.96
the father but me but by me

5446.44 --> 5452.119
yeah that doesn't mean I'm God just for

5449.96 --> 5452.119
the

5452.92 --> 5455.92
record

5456.52 --> 5459.4800000000005
that just means

5460.32 --> 5469.5199999999995
hey this is the way you get to God you

5465.92 --> 5472.4800000000005
get closer to God you have to find the

5469.52 --> 5475.280000000001
way through the middle path the narrow

5472.48 --> 5478.119
path you have to follow these very

5475.28 --> 5482.0
specific tactical

5478.119 --> 5482.0
instructions and then you'll make

5482.92 --> 5485.92
it

5486.29 --> 5489.489
[Music]

5496.119 --> 5498.36

love joyful

5510.239 --> 5516.0
Living Well Easter is all about rebirth

5513.0 --> 5519.719
I mean literally Rebirth of nature

5516.0 --> 5519.719
Rebirth of

5522.36 --> 5528.88
Christ really synchronous like that's

5525.96 --> 5533.96
Easter is like a real synchronization of

5528.88 --> 5538.76
old paganism and Christianity in that

5533.96 --> 5542.84
sense to match the rebirth moment of

5538.76 --> 5547.84
Jesus and with the

5542.84 --> 5550.56
yearly moment of of yeah natural rebirth

5547.84 --> 5550.56
like through the

5564.92 --> 5568.109
[Music]

5570.92 --> 5575.84
seasons anything about Jes makes no

5573.52 --> 5575.84
sense

5581.88 --> 5587.4400000000005
okay that's a very strange thing to say

5584.84 --> 5587.4400000000005
Arthur be

5599.119 --> 5605.199
flat can we wish each other happy New

5605.199 --> 5609.5599999999995
uh you

5606.32 --> 5609.5599999999995
could I

5632.719 --> 5635.719
guess

5692.639 --> 5695.639
h

5698.159 --> 5702.159
right I'm going to take a two-minute

5699.239 --> 5702.159
break be right

5722.639 --> 5725.639
back

5752.639 --> 5755.639
e

5782.56 --> 5785.56
e

5827.33 --> 5831.83
[Music]

5837.56 --> 5841.88
filing up the prophets of Jewish

5839.119 --> 5841.88
scripture

5842.0 --> 5847.32
right yes that part is complicated

5844.719 --> 5847.32
Arthur be

5852.719 --> 5862.8
flat also you got to wonder

5857.199 --> 5862.799999999999
though what was this Jewish

5868.84 --> 5875.8
scripture is it these Jewish scriptures

5872.679 --> 5875.8
that we know off

5881.84 --> 5888.8
today the Old Testament yeah well how do

5885.32 --> 5891.599
you know the Old Testament is that

5888.8 --> 5892.639
old I've heard some very strange things

5891.599 --> 5897.04
about

5892.639 --> 5897.04
it that it's not actually that

5900.679 --> 5908.88
old yeah I know here we go again I'm not

5904.679 --> 5911.76
even adding those the thing is is that

5908.88 --> 5911.76
how do you really

5932.44 --> 5935.44
know

5940.599 --> 5946.719
I mean am I the only one that feels like

5943.84 --> 5950.159000000001
maybe the Old Testament is actually

5946.719 --> 5950.159
just one

5950.44 --> 5960.719
version one part in a in a big spectrum

5956.4 --> 5962.36
of all kinds of things that would have

5960.719 --> 5965.36
been

5962.36 --> 5965.36
there

5968.8 --> 5972.360000000001
that would make the whole thing much

5970.719 --> 5976.119
more

5972.36 --> 5979.88
complete just look at the Old

5976.119 --> 5983.44

5979.88 --> 5984.67

5992.04 --> 6000.56
just it just just really begs the differ

5996.88 --> 6004.08
like this is not complete I mean aren't

6000.56 --> 6005.400000000001
you guys just like noticing that like

6004.08 --> 6007.96
this is not

6005.4 --> 6013.119
complete where's the

6007.96 --> 6014.71

is that's like Egyptian

6082.239 --> 6085.239
super

6103.639 --> 6108.4400000000005
personally I don't see any issues with

6107.4 --> 6111.638999999999
saying

6108.44 --> 6115.96
that I mean it is kind of very close to

6111.639 --> 6119.32
it e to to Easter I mean you can't

6115.96 --> 6119.32
really write that off as a

6119.4 --> 6126.0
coincidence especially if probably spell

6123.48 --> 6129.0
correction is literally doing that cuz

6126.0 --> 6134.0
I'm I'm going to assume that duper

6129.0 --> 6134.0

about here we go

6262.04 --> 6265.04
again

6267.0 --> 6275.679
look we took over the Upper Egypt and

6270.88 --> 6278.32
died divided I take it Kingdom

6275.679 --> 6282.8
that's

6278.32 --> 6286.239
probably but I mean I I have no problem

6282.8 --> 6289.360000000001
with Egyptian ISM Egyptian religion even

6286.239 --> 6294.04
though they have some really bizarre

6289.36 --> 6296.28
squirty crazy ult ritual [ __ ]

6294.04 --> 6299.5199999999995

6296.28 --> 6304.5199999999995
crazy but uh I

6299.52 --> 6308.1990000000005
mean I Think Jesus was a ginger and

6304.52 --> 6310.360000000001
potentially a descendant of

6308.199 --> 6313.598999999999
Cleopatra yeah I said

6310.36 --> 6317.92
it so there

6313.599 --> 6321.96
is like at least a bloodline connection

6317.92 --> 6326.36
to the Egyptian priesthood in a

6321.96 --> 6330.4800000000005
way oh how dare you oh that's the

6326.36 --> 6330.48
enemy what the enemy of

6336.84 --> 6342.07
Rome anybody making the connection yet

6339.4 --> 6349.25

6350.239 --> 6356.839999999999

6353.84 --> 6356.84
duper

6359.88 --> 6364.1990000000005
hilarious yeah it

6361.84 --> 6368.2390000000005
isn't but they might

6364.199 --> 6371.598999999999
be trying to take the Egyptian

6368.239 --> 6375.239
religion the mystery religion and like

6371.599 --> 6377.96
occultly apply it

6375.239 --> 6380.159
duper so you could say

6377.96 --> 6384.32
maybe

6380.159 --> 6387.92
America is Neo Egypt or

6384.32 --> 6392.08
something but it was never the the land

6387.92 --> 6392.08
of Egypt that that's

6410.599 --> 6415.0
nonsense yeah Richard that's a good

6412.56 --> 6417.360000000001
point paganism is widely vared across

6415.0 --> 6419.76
the world and everybody does equate

6417.36 --> 6422.119
paganism with what happens around Rome

6419.76 --> 6426.679
why would that be could it be because

6422.119 --> 6429.159
they were Imperial paganism like they

6426.679 --> 6431.84
were an Empire they were Pagan as a

6429.159 --> 6435.598999999999
religion they were big they spread it

6431.84 --> 6437.360000000001
around so yeah paganism is logically

6435.599 --> 6441.52
going to be equated

6437.36 --> 6441.5199999999995
with Roman Imperial

6441.84 --> 6447.079
paganism

6443.97 --> 6447.079000000001
[Music]

6447.679 --> 6451.32
that then later assimilated

6452.199 --> 6458.44
Christianity yeah I mean people that say

6455.52 --> 6462.400000000001
it converted to Christianity that's

6458.44 --> 6466.119
really cute no it it it assimilated

6462.4 --> 6466.119
Christianity it did not

6467.52 --> 6473.2390000000005
convert it was a change for the better

6471.0 --> 6475.32
arguably but I mean if if it would

6473.239 --> 6478.799999999999
convert then it would drop all its

6475.32 --> 6480.759999999999
paganistic traits and it

6478.8 --> 6485.04
hasn't

6480.76 --> 6485.04
so I'd say assimilate

6497.679 --> 6503.88
Christianity mystery Babylon yeah

6501.239 --> 6506.44
mystery whatever Babylon on

6503.88 --> 6509.8
Egypt all of it they're just like all

6506.44 --> 6512.839999999999

6540.76 --> 6548.400000000001
this statue of a pharaoh that like if

6546.0 --> 6551.0
you saw that you immediately think of

6548.4 --> 6553.159

6599.48 --> 6602.879999999999
Neck here we go again that's

6621.639 --> 6624.639
weird

6638.599 --> 6644.679
yeah about that Arthur be flat I heard

6640.599 --> 6644.679
something very interesting from

6646.04 --> 6650.36
uh damn it what's his name

6651.639 --> 6656.52
again

6654.079 --> 6659.48
Jordan

6656.52 --> 6660.96
Maxwell who who actually stated they

6659.48 --> 6663.638999999999
made an

6660.96 --> 6668.119
atomical piece of reasoning behind it

6663.639 --> 6671.4800000000005
but it was interesting to consider that

6668.119 --> 6675.119
monism was actually

6671.48 --> 6679.48
not this like interpreted and spelled

6675.119 --> 6684.44
wrong that it was

6679.48 --> 6689.5199999999995
monism or monism what was it

6684.44 --> 6692.44
which would mean that he says you choose

6689.52 --> 6696.360000000001
a God and then stick with that

6692.44 --> 6700.32
one not that it there is only one God so

6696.36 --> 6702.4
I think that whoever said that about

6700.32 --> 6706.84
Abraham's God being

6702.4 --> 6711.36
Jupiter might be referring to that

6706.84 --> 6711.360000000001
idea that's clear that said

6711.52 --> 6714.52
that

6716.56 --> 6719.679
and I

6720.159 --> 6727.28
mean I can't tell I can't I I can't

6724.96 --> 6732.159
say I don't

6727.28 --> 6732.159
know so where I'm going to put that

6739.159 --> 6743.96
one there might

6741.52 --> 6748.599
be

6743.96 --> 6751.599
other influences other faces of God like

6748.599 --> 6753.32
other sides of him I've argued very

6751.599 --> 6758.52
early on when it wasn't even that much

6753.32 --> 6760.239
into Christianity that God just is

6758.52 --> 6765.4800000000005
however

6760.239 --> 6765.48
you believe him to be in a

6766.0 --> 6774.199
way that depending on what your attitude

6770.159 --> 6776.32
is and your view on all things that God

6774.199 --> 6780.199
becomes like

6776.32 --> 6783.5199999999995
a reflection of that an

6780.199 --> 6785.598999999999
extrapolation of that so that God

6783.52 --> 6789.92
basically appears to

6785.599 --> 6789.92
you directly or indirectly

6790.56 --> 6794.320000000001
mostly as you

6795.599 --> 6799.52
are and how you see the

6799.639 --> 6802.96
world so that if you like dwell in

6802.199 --> 6805.4
darkness

6802.96 --> 6807.639
then God will

6805.4 --> 6810.638999999999
be

6807.639 --> 6810.639
like

6813.76 --> 6818.0
punishing

6816.119 --> 6820.719
and yeah

6818.0 --> 6826.119
hard all these things but if you like

6820.719 --> 6826.119
dwell in light then it's a different

6828.44 --> 6833.44
experience and that the

6831.44 --> 6836.5599999999995
others the

6833.44 --> 6839.119
other potential gods that are out there

6836.56 --> 6841.52
simply like they don't really match up

6839.119 --> 6841.5199999999995
to this

6842.96 --> 6849.56
one they might be less cohesive there

6846.84 --> 6852.4400000000005
might even be an astrological connection

6849.56 --> 6856.119000000001
that it all depends on where the the the

6852.44 --> 6858.879999999999
sky clock is over the Ages which God

6856.119 --> 6858.88
becomes

6861.36 --> 6866.079
optimal it's all really

6869.76 --> 6879.639
complicated above and beyond God's right

6874.159 --> 6881.598999999999
above so not hey those gods of Egyptians

6879.639 --> 6884.599
don't

6881.599 --> 6884.599
exist

6884.96 --> 6892.679
huh Arthur be flat you're literally by

6889.52 --> 6895.1990000000005
what you're saying admitting that yeah

6892.679 --> 6898.119
this God is

6895.199 --> 6900.4
better doesn't deny that there are gods

6898.119 --> 6900.4
of

6911.679 --> 6916.639
Egyptians just saying you

small G Gods yeah I'm

6933.84 --> 6942.159000000001
sure but even that implies that there

6937.0 --> 6942.159
are different gods and that a god

6942.719 --> 6946.92
rules that one of them is a

6951.239 --> 6954.239

7052.32 --> 7058.199
I agree to

that I'm just

7059.8 --> 7068.28
saying you follow one God it doesn't

7064.52 --> 7068.280000000001
deny that there are other

gods

7079.679 --> 7086.599
fulse

7080.92 --> 7086.599

7093.92 --> 7100.1990000000005

not denied to be

real no not calm down not calm

7131.04 --> 7134.04

stop

7140.32 --> 7146.719
gring talking about the truth

7143.639 --> 7151.04
here don't need to grubel no need to

7146.719 --> 7151.04
fear somebody looking at what you're

7153.719 --> 7157.2390000000005
saying it's not

7160.199 --> 7164.759999999999
denied yeah

7163.52 --> 7167.679
they are

7164.76 --> 7170.96
gods they are now you

7167.679 --> 7173.639
could compare them in value or you could

7170.96 --> 7177.0
[ __ ] all over them all you like it's not

7173.639 --> 7177.0
denied that they are

7191.04 --> 7194.04

7197.199 --> 7202.44
yeah no more many gods to

7199.679 --> 7205.1990000000005
worship that's right Richard is perfect

7202.44 --> 7208.239
that's right he wanted

7205.199 --> 7215.48
that something a directive yeah it

7208.239 --> 7215.48
doesn't mean there are no other

7216.04 --> 7220.96
gods it just

7218.44 --> 7223.96
changes the

7220.96 --> 7223.96
perspective

7230.32 --> 7236.799999999999
and leaves a mystery

7233.76 --> 7239.96
obviously right it does leave a

7236.8 --> 7243.639
mystery because if there's multiple

7239.96 --> 7246.4
gods and one of them claims Supremacy

7243.639 --> 7249.32
and got

7246.4 --> 7250.36
it then what about the Elohim which are

7249.32 --> 7253.239
also

7250.36 --> 7258.199
multiple so is

7253.239 --> 7258.199
ja in this case a part of the

7261.56 --> 7267.76
Elohim if so

7264.56 --> 7271.320000000001
then he technically wouldn't have been

7267.76 --> 7275.1990000000005
the architect the one outside of all of

7271.32 --> 7275.199
it then he is one of the

7280.92 --> 7288.56
Elohim yeah no need to do that here we

7283.92 --> 7288.56
go again no need to say any of

7291.679 --> 7298.76
that and nobody's antagonizing

7294.84 --> 7302.76
me yeah you're antagonizing by making a

7298.76 --> 7302.76
statement like that no need to do

7310.84 --> 7314.84
that

7312.56 --> 7318.4400000000005
power than humans that there no nobody

7314.84 --> 7322.76
cares about power over humans or not I'm

7318.44 --> 7324.04
just saying origin meaning of words gods

7322.76 --> 7328.8
they are

7324.04 --> 7334.4
Gods yeah monism means you

7328.8 --> 7337.320000000001
don't go and worship the other gods

7334.4 --> 7340.5599999999995
alongside the number one

7337.32 --> 7344.119
God but what it specifically technically

7340.56 --> 7348.4800000000005
means is that there

7344.119 --> 7348.48
are other

7350.679 --> 7358.32
gods that monotheism does not deny other

7355.36 --> 7358.32
gods to

7367.84 --> 7374.719
exist where did they come from who cares

7372.84 --> 7380.0
it doesn't matter where they come from

7374.719 --> 7384.8
it matters that there are

7380.0 --> 7389.92
others that there is not just one

7384.8 --> 7393.0
God which is a popular mistake in

7389.92 --> 7393.0
regarding the word

7393.32 --> 7400.199
monotheism but it isn't it just

7396.56 --> 7402.280000000001
means no other God before this

7400.199 --> 7405.678999999999
one which

7402.28 --> 7410.4
automatically insinuates other

7405.679 --> 7415.96
gods there are others and they are

7410.4 --> 7415.96
Gods there's a thing there's a thing

7416.88 --> 7422.079
there an

7419.8 --> 7425.599
implication that is

7422.079 --> 7428.92
it and that widens the

7425.599 --> 7432.2390000000005
puzzle because if there are other

7428.92 --> 7434.559
gods well then what are these Gods then

7432.239 --> 7438.718999999999
are they the

7434.559 --> 7440.84
Elohim which are also multiple are they

7438.719 --> 7440.84
the

7445.04 --> 7452.239
Shapers and if so are they the fathers

7449.159 --> 7452.239
of the sons of

7452.32 --> 7458.719
God which are so briefly spoken about

7455.28 --> 7458.719
did they also create

7459.119 --> 7462.639
them

7460.719 --> 7465.159
and

7462.639 --> 7465.159000000001
who's the

7466.8 --> 7472.1990000000005
architect who is the one that is outside

7469.679 --> 7472.1990000000005
of all of

7472.719 --> 7480.199
it

7474.84 --> 7483.4400000000005
is the monotheist god the architect that

7480.199 --> 7483.44
is outside of all of

7484.88 --> 7491.28
it or is he

7487.639 --> 7496.599
not because I think that Jesus may have

7491.28 --> 7499.159
Act refer to the architect who was not

7496.599 --> 7499.159000000001
of this

7499.639 --> 7508.04
world instead of the monotheist God who

7504.599 --> 7508.04
is of this

7508.159 --> 7514.839999999999
world the Elohim who shaped

7512.28 --> 7517.4
it the

7514.84 --> 7519.4400000000005
Shapers well if you shaped it how can

7517.4 --> 7523.36
you not be of this

7519.44 --> 7525.558999999999
world see and so the the

7523.36 --> 7528.44
puzzle comes a little bit more

7525.559 --> 7528.4400000000005
complicated to

7539.52 --> 7545.52
interpret

7541.639 --> 7547.92
right Alim means multiple I know that oh

7545.52 --> 7551.719
is one yeah one of

7547.92 --> 7554.719
them the one God that tells you don't

7551.719 --> 7554.719
worship the other

7557.639 --> 7564.679
gods you don't need to tell anybody not

7561.44 --> 7567.799999999999
to worship the other gods if you're the

7564.679 --> 7567.8
only God that

7571.11 --> 7575.82
[Music]

7580.559 --> 7583.559
exists

7592.119 --> 7598.44
so was Jesus actually

7595.52 --> 7600.92
referencing that God the god of the Old

7598.44 --> 7604.839999999999
Testament one of the

7600.92 --> 7608.96
Elohim who said not to worship another

7604.84 --> 7613.1990000000005
God is Jesus referencing that God or is

7608.96 --> 7615.84
he referencing the architect

7613.199 --> 7618.879999999999
the one that is not of this

7615.84 --> 7624.119000000001
world a different

7618.88 --> 7628.52
God or not even a god it would

7624.119 --> 7631.48
be a different class of entity or even

7628.52 --> 7636.1990000000005
non- entity it's not of this

7631.48 --> 7636.199
world but the

7640.52 --> 7643.52
designer

7652.92 --> 7657.079
yeah clutch

7655.04 --> 7659.559
sure I think you're just getting a

7657.079 --> 7663.079
little bit too caught up in this I'm

7659.559 --> 7665.4800000000005
just spitballing here I'm trying to put

7663.079 --> 7665.48
things

7665.599 --> 7670.4400000000005
together it's not all

7668.62 --> 7673.44
[Music]

7670.44 --> 7673.44
resolved

7680.32 --> 7687.558999999999
yeah and Arthur I mean this whole

7684.679 --> 7691.4800000000005
fallen angels and all that that's a

7687.559 --> 7694.639
whole different classification like I

7691.48 --> 7698.44
think that the sons of

7694.639 --> 7698.4400000000005
God are the Fallen

7699.559 --> 7705.96
Angels or maybe not even that Fallen

7702.8 --> 7708.92
Angels made Simply Be Spirits it's all

7705.96 --> 7710.559
just very complicated I'm just trying to

7708.92 --> 7713.32
figure

7710.559 --> 7718.320000000001
out

7713.32 --> 7724.48
God the one that shaped Adam and

7718.32 --> 7724.48
Eve one of the Elohim he's not the only

7725.48 --> 7733.598999999999
God who did like who is part of that

7728.239 --> 7737.759999999999
he's not the only figure a soul full

7733.599 --> 7740.719
figure and monotheism is don't worship

7737.76 --> 7743.88
the other gods just

7740.719 --> 7747.88
me but is

7743.88 --> 7750.96
Jesus referencing that

7747.88 --> 7753.079
God or is he basically bypassing him

7750.96 --> 7755.92
saying like no there is a God that's not

7753.079 --> 7758.159
of this world well if you literally

7755.92 --> 7760.36
created and shaped this world how can

7758.159 --> 7763.36
you not be the God of this

7760.36 --> 7763.36
world

7766.98 --> 7770.12
[Music]

7779.16 --> 7782.3589999999995
[Music]

7787.88 --> 7795.4800000000005
[Music]

7790.52 --> 7795.4800000000005
that is the one is referencing yeah okay

7801.119 --> 7806.719
but right so that's not the one who

7804.719 --> 7810.8
shaped Adam and Eve

7806.719 --> 7810.8
then cuz that was done by the

7820.32 --> 7823.32
Elohim

7823.96 --> 7827.88
fake Christian

7835.88 --> 7844.079
okay no it wasn't oh my god well it

7839.36 --> 7844.079
looks like uh got the puppets dancing

7845.719 --> 7853.4
here right and this is part of the

7849.88 --> 7854.92
Dilemma in General the confusing

7853.4 --> 7858.48
confusion that

7854.92 --> 7861.639
surrounds wisdom of Jesus I like to

7858.48 --> 7866.4
trust wisdom of

7861.639 --> 7866.400000000001
Jesus more than

7866.84 --> 7872.559
to have a perceived

7870.44 --> 7877.598999999999
certainty

7872.559 --> 7881.400000000001
about what God is and or the gods are

7877.599 --> 7883.04
and what who what where yeah because in

7881.4 --> 7885.48
gets kind of confusing when you really

7883.04 --> 7887.079
start to think about it just like I'm

7885.48 --> 7890.079
demonstrating and every all the puppets

7887.079 --> 7891.44
are dancing now everybody's feeling it

7890.079 --> 7894.96
it's

7891.44 --> 7898.36
like yeah but one thing I do know is

7894.96 --> 7901.599
that underneath all of that Jesus's

7898.36 --> 7901.598999999999
wisdom is

7903.96 --> 7908.599
immutable can better trust in the wisdom

7906.84 --> 7912.32
of Jesus

7908.599 --> 7915.4400000000005
than a perceived knowledge

7912.32 --> 7918.36
of who God really

7915.44 --> 7921.28
is don't call you puppet it's just

7918.36 --> 7924.119
metaphor don't be so touchy

7921.28 --> 7926.159
clutch puppets are dancing I'm not

7924.119 --> 7929.119
saying you are a puppet and you are

7926.159 --> 7929.119
dancing it's a

7930.32 --> 7935.639
metaphor God it get so touchy all of a

7940.159 --> 7943.159
sudden

7948.46 --> 7951.909
[Music]

7968.239 --> 7973.959999999999
hey what is

7970.119 --> 7973.96
that what are you

7974.32 --> 7978.48
doing you're not what are you

7980.599 --> 7984.159000000001
doing don't do

7986.04 --> 7992.44
that I mean yeah here we go again you're

7988.719 --> 7994.76
being annoying don't don't be divisive

7992.44 --> 7998.879999999999
in my chat but clutch you're not

7994.76 --> 7998.88
supposed to just time somebody out like

7999.639 --> 8007.400000000001
that yeah I mean remove the message

8003.88 --> 8007.400000000001
perhaps but don't timer

8016.599 --> 8022.719
out you're not supposed to be doing that

8019.239 --> 8026.4
clutch this is kind

8022.719 --> 8031.4
of a bit of a wrench abuse I'm not going

8026.4 --> 8035.239
to cuz the situation is kind of hot I

8031.4 --> 8038.32
get it but be mindful that you're not

8035.239 --> 8038.32
supposed to be doing

8043.239 --> 8050.598999999999
that got to have a good Easter all right

8046.639 --> 8050.599
you go definitely do

8052.44 --> 8057.879999999999
enjoy just

8056.28 --> 8063.04
yeah

8057.88 --> 8063.04
trust in Jesus's wisdom

8064.239 --> 8070.959999999999
and Trust in the architecture of

8067.84 --> 8075.119000000001
God of the ontological Primitive how it

8070.96 --> 8076.96
has to be but just know that there

8075.119 --> 8080.36
is

8076.96 --> 8081.96
confusion about what is

8080.36 --> 8087.079
God

8081.96 --> 8087.079
within the religion within the

8087.84 --> 8093.04
teachings and there will be confusion

8093.239 --> 8097.4
it's not going to just easily go

8111.36 --> 8117.36
away right and like there's so many ways

8114.28 --> 8118.44
to perceive that situation like oh so

8117.36 --> 8122.36
it's

8118.44 --> 8124.32
one of the Gods of the aloh is that is

8122.36 --> 8128.28
that the god of the

8124.32 --> 8131.36
Bible is Jesus referring to that

8128.28 --> 8133.199
God or is that where it all came from

8131.36 --> 8136.119
from the Old

8133.199 --> 8139.799999999999
Testament or is Jesus actually talking

8136.119 --> 8142.679
about a God that did

8139.8 --> 8145.84
not manifest on Earth

8142.679 --> 8149.4400000000005
physically that is outside of it that's

8145.84 --> 8152.88
always out of this world not of this

8149.44 --> 8156.0
world where you might go not one of the

8152.88 --> 8157.36
ones that are part of creating this

8156.0 --> 8160.119
realm the

8157.36 --> 8161.679
Shapers yeah that's why I specifically

8160.119 --> 8165.04
make this

8161.679 --> 8166.8
distinction you have the architect and

8165.04 --> 8168.88
you have the

8166.8 --> 8171.96
Shapers they're

8168.88 --> 8174.119
different one is outside of the world in

8171.96 --> 8176.76
the Timeless realm the master of

8174.119 --> 8180.239
information architecture The Keeper of

8176.76 --> 8182.639
the akashic record not of this world and

8180.239 --> 8186.32
then you have the Shapers who had to

8182.639 --> 8190.28
have manifested somehow within

8186.32 --> 8194.599
the Physical Realm shaped

8190.28 --> 8197.76
it potentially initiated time and

8194.599 --> 8201.639000000001
entropy and then who knows what happened

8197.76 --> 8201.639000000001
hold on be right

8209.84 --> 8212.84
back

8239.84 --> 8242.84
e

8269.84 --> 8272.84
e

8299.76 --> 8302.76
e

8329.719 --> 8332.719
e

8359.719 --> 8362.719
e

8363.399 --> 8367.358999999999
oops sorry mute yeah yeah

8370.04 --> 8377.92
yeah right I'm just wondering

8373.8 --> 8379.84
like how was it seen way back thousands

8377.92 --> 8383.0
of years back was

8379.84 --> 8387.319
Jupiter the

8383.0 --> 8388.56
architect or was he one of the Gods of

8387.319 --> 8393.399
the

8388.56 --> 8398.319
Shapers did because like the Elohim even

8393.399 --> 8400.92
in in Genesis like together they shaped

8398.319 --> 8403.279999999999
it they shaped the

8400.92 --> 8406.92
Realms but if you're shaping the realm

8403.28 --> 8410.960000000001
then you're like together doing

8406.92 --> 8410.960000000001
that who's the actual

8411.24 --> 8417.119999999999
architect so was Jupiter like the god

8414.72 --> 8417.119999999999
that

8417.24 --> 8424.72
didn't go to the material frequency to

8421.24 --> 8429.28
manifest did he stay out of it and let

8424.72 --> 8431.599999999999
the rest manifest like how how did that

8429.28 --> 8431.6
all

8431.92 --> 8437.56
happen if Jesus's God is the supreme god

8435.8 --> 8440.24
and he's not of this

8437.56 --> 8443.359
world then how can a God not of this

8440.24 --> 8446.359
world help to shape this

8443.359 --> 8446.359
world

8447.08 --> 8452.56
logic a

8449.2 --> 8458.2
complication Within the

8452.56 --> 8458.199999999999
logic it may reveal a deeper

8471.24 --> 8474.24
mystery

8476.96 --> 8484.679999999998
right like can the designer

8482.52 --> 8487.92
the original design of the Supreme cour

8484.68 --> 8490.6
does he have powers to intervene within

8487.92 --> 8491.64
the Physical Realm or does he only have

8490.6 --> 8494.92
powers to

8491.64 --> 8497.96
intervene using information and the

8494.92 --> 8497.960000000001
Consciousness and the

8509.52 --> 8512.52
spirit

8513.8 --> 8519.479
right

8515.88 --> 8519.479
considerations that's what these

8533.6 --> 8537.319
are ye s

8539.52 --> 8542.52
Jesus

8544.6 --> 8549.960000000001
rubbish God if he can do

8547.16 --> 8555.399
stuff really

8549.96 --> 8556.64
so your definition of God is being able

8555.399 --> 8561.519999999999
to do

8556.64 --> 8561.519999999999
stuff how about designing

8564.88 --> 8572.438999999998
everything what just because you are

8567.68 --> 8572.439
part of the design and you can't

8572.6 --> 8577.24
appreciate the infinite

8578.319 --> 8583.88
complexity you think he's a rubbish God

8580.8 --> 8585.96
because he can't entertain your

8583.88 --> 8590.599999999999
contemporary

8585.96 --> 8592.839999999998
being with a feet of Supernatural

8590.6 --> 8596.640000000001
power you think that that makes him a

8592.84 --> 8599.359
rubbish God do you you're literally part

8596.64 --> 8602.439
of and bathing within the Miracles of

8599.359 --> 8602.439
his design

8618.96 --> 8623.0
I brought it up I'm merely responding

8623.56 --> 8627.519999999999
to to what was said

8629.439 --> 8632.439
before

8642.439 --> 8647.800000000001
I'm just trying to put the pieces

8644.56 --> 8651.6
together you know seems to all be very

8647.8 --> 8657.16
tough on everybody and

8651.6 --> 8657.16
like I'm not blaming you it is

8659.359 --> 8662.359
tough

8666.82 --> 8670.059
[Music]

8690.12 --> 8693.929
oh

8690.69 --> 8693.929
[Music]

8702.04 --> 8709.080000000002
can God make a square

8704.92 --> 8714.439
circle no because self-contradiction

8709.08 --> 8719.319
can't be true and God is truth Satan is

8714.439 --> 8722.319
lies so God can't make something that is

8719.319 --> 8722.319
paradoxical

8735.84 --> 8739.399
can't break the laws of

8740.24 --> 8749.64
logic he is the laws of logic God is the

8746.439 --> 8752.6
law yeah that's how I see that but I

8749.64 --> 8755.72
mean that's just my esoteric approach

8752.6 --> 8760.56
God is truth Satan is lies and I mean I

8755.72 --> 8760.56
take that statement extremely

8762.08 --> 8766.12
serious woven through all

8774.8 --> 8783.438999999998
things not the law maker though he is

8777.96 --> 8783.438999999998
the law not the maker it's already

8784.96 --> 8790.438999999998
made there's no making making is a

8788.64 --> 8794.358999999999
development

8790.439 --> 8799.960000000001
process he just is the law it is the

8794.359 --> 8799.960000000001
truth the truth is God and God is the

8809.24 --> 8812.24
truth

8921.439 --> 8929.04
good morning hello debatable D yeah you

8924.439 --> 8932.04
are late God you're freaking

8929.04 --> 8932.04
late

8953.92 --> 8959.04
miss the law of logic

8956.399 --> 8961.8
made it is

8959.04 --> 8964.479000000001
there

8961.8 --> 8966.88
he's the designer of the akashic library

8964.479 --> 8969.358999999999
but I mean logically he's not within

8966.88 --> 8972.759999999998
time or

8969.359 --> 8972.76
matter so

8973.439 --> 8977.2
making it's already

8983.439 --> 8989.04
made when did the show

8986.279 --> 8992.04
start two and a half hours

8989.04 --> 8992.04
ago

8993.439 --> 9002.0
and I was basically an hour

8995.96 --> 9002.0
late so yeah you're technically 3 hours

9006.16 --> 9010.92
late

9008.0 --> 9012.8
but I hope you're late for a good reason

9010.92 --> 9015.0
because you had a really nice Easter

9012.8 --> 9018.0
breakfast or something that that's

9015.0 --> 9018.0
perfectly

9018.96 --> 9021.96
Justified

9029.72 --> 9034.88
how can we know if the Bible is the true

9032.24 --> 9039.039999999999
word of God you

9034.88 --> 9041.88
can't but you can recognize God when you

9039.04 --> 9044.359
feel it when you hear

9041.88 --> 9046.0
it and I

9044.359 --> 9049.52
find

9046.0 --> 9050.68
God God being truth within the words of

9049.52 --> 9053.0
Jesus

9050.68 --> 9055.479000000001
no matter what you do no matter what you

9053.0 --> 9058.279
do to them no matter with what angle of

9055.479 --> 9061.24
approach you approach his

9058.279 --> 9063.92
words it's like if you apply his words

9061.24 --> 9067.119999999999
in wisdom like

9063.92 --> 9070.399
a a key

9067.12 --> 9073.560000000001
code to an encrypted puzzle and then you

9070.399 --> 9074.72
apply absolutely everything you can to

9073.56 --> 9078.119999999999
those key

9074.72 --> 9081.92
codes they always come out optimally and

9078.12 --> 9081.92
that's how I recognize

9082.439 --> 9090.0
God through the fractal implications of

9086.439 --> 9093.52
the words no matter how you apply

9090.0 --> 9093.52
them it's not a

9097.439 --> 9101.960000000001
feeling it's just how well does it

9102.279 --> 9109.2
fit if something is

9106.359 --> 9110.479000000001
immutable that means that no matter how

9109.2 --> 9112.52
you apply

9110.479 --> 9117.199999999999
it it

9112.52 --> 9122.12
works that's immutable that is

9117.2 --> 9126.399000000001
God if God is truth and Satan is

9122.12 --> 9126.399000000001
lies means that it always

9127.12 --> 9134.399000000001
works Z yeah seagulls out there that's

9131.08 --> 9134.399
right going

9138.84 --> 9145.68
around went out for E okay no problem de

9142.52 --> 9147.0
welcome to the show it's been uh it's

9145.68 --> 9150.08
been

9147.0 --> 9152.92
interesting I'm tackling a tough subject

9150.08 --> 9152.92
like what is

9153.8 --> 9160.64
God what are the

9156.24 --> 9164.0
Elohim is the god of the Bible one of

9160.64 --> 9168.84
the Elohim that helped shaped the

9164.0 --> 9172.12
world but it Jesus referenced that his

9168.84 --> 9173.880000000001
God his father is is not of this world

9172.12 --> 9175.800000000001
if his God is Not of this world how

9173.88 --> 9180.399
could he be one of the Elohim that

9175.8 --> 9185.319
shaped the world so there's a dilemma

9180.399 --> 9185.319
there immutable means unchanged

9195.8 --> 9202.599999999999
yes you need to change your phone yeah

9198.439 --> 9202.6
your phone is definitely not immutable

9203.68 --> 9208.800000000001
dupons thanks for being there hope you

9206.319 --> 9208.8
have a great

9226.04 --> 9230.399000000001
Easter right I think it have something

9228.68 --> 9233.68
to do with faith

9230.399 --> 9236.96
well partially because how will you know

9233.68 --> 9239.16
it will always apply you'd have to trust

9236.96 --> 9242.24
that based on past

9239.16 --> 9246.08
experiences so if everything you

9242.24 --> 9249.279
reference and cross reference and

9246.08 --> 9251.8
compare to Jesus's

9249.279 --> 9256.319000000001
wisdom and it all

9251.8 --> 9258.72
works then how could you not believe

9256.319 --> 9260.519999999999
that it applies to all

9258.72 --> 9263.0
things

9260.52 --> 9267.439
when everything you apply to it proves

9263.0 --> 9271.479
it works yes there may be new things but

9267.439 --> 9271.479000000001
why would you assume that they wouldn't

9273.04 --> 9279.479000000001
apply if everything thus far

9276.399 --> 9283.039999999999
does I mean that's how we have to go

9279.479 --> 9285.8
about with our timeline bound

9283.04 --> 9288.640000000001
Consciousness and so faith is basically

9285.8 --> 9291.399
the trust in that

9288.64 --> 9295.199999999999
things

9291.399 --> 9297.84
will be in a certain way based on the

9295.2 --> 9300.2
experience of how it has been

9297.84 --> 9304.68
always what you

9300.2 --> 9306.76
know and what you trust but trust

9304.68 --> 9312.24
doesn't just come out of nothing it

9306.76 --> 9312.24
comes out of seeing how things

9312.479 --> 9321.16
happen trust is based on past

9316.92 --> 9324.960000000001
experiences so Faith coming from

9321.16 --> 9328.0
trust there has to be something that

9324.96 --> 9329.759999999998
proves that things will happen the way

9328.0 --> 9332.24
you would predict they would happen

9329.76 --> 9333.79
based on how you see things how you

9332.24 --> 9337.099
believe them to

9333.79 --> 9337.099
[Music]

9347.12 --> 9353.52
be need spiritual no no it has nothing

9350.359 --> 9355.68
to do with that the D no the Alim as in

9353.52 --> 9355.68
the

9356.24 --> 9364.76
Shapers the gods the Elohim within

9360.359 --> 9369.720000000001
Genesis who shaped the Earth and and

9364.76 --> 9369.72
shaped life and man and

9371.8 --> 9374.92
woman the

9377.16 --> 9382.92
Shapers some people believe the Ali are

9380.04 --> 9387.52
aliens of course they do of

9382.92 --> 9387.52
course cuz of course it's

9389.2 --> 9396.08
aliens always is right if you run into a

9392.92 --> 9400.2
dead end you're not sure

9396.08 --> 9403.12
aliens right I mean heliocentrism will

9400.2 --> 9403.12
always agree with

9408.52 --> 9414.5
you

9411.41 --> 9414.5
[Music]

9425.319 --> 9429.199999999999
all right anyway hope you all are

9427.12 --> 9432.560000000001
enjoying the show it's I can't believe

9429.2 --> 9432.560000000001
two and a half hours already

9433.08 --> 9438.2
passed see if I got some

9435.52 --> 9441.0
Rogan all I got

9438.2 --> 9444.84
seven yeah if you're still here please

9441.0 --> 9447.72
don't forget to Rogan it up hope you're

9444.84 --> 9450.960000000001
you got some food for thought might be a

9447.72 --> 9452.319
little bit unnerving considering like

9450.96 --> 9454.72
the day that we're

9452.319 --> 9456.96
remembering Christ's rebirth and all

9454.72 --> 9456.96
that

9457.2 --> 9465.240000000002
and I didn't mean to poison any Wells by

9461.8 --> 9468.438999999998
accident but I am like you know what

9465.24 --> 9470.6
let's really take a deep deep scoop of

9468.439 --> 9472.16
that well and let's see where this

9470.6 --> 9474.720000000001
actually comes from that that's

9472.16 --> 9476.76
basically what I've done here and I hope

9474.72 --> 9478.92
people can appreciate it and not just be

9476.76 --> 9484.12
like oh damn it you Arn you always have

9478.92 --> 9484.12
to do this you always have to ruin it

9485.12 --> 9494.92
sorry it's just I can't help it I just

9490.8 --> 9498.119999999999
like I see an opportunity and I have to

9494.92 --> 9498.12
like do

9498.439 --> 9501.439
it

9505.319 --> 9507.64
that's

9507.92 --> 9514.359
right it is important within Christian

9511.399 --> 9516.199999999999
faith right and I do hold very strong to

9514.359 --> 9519.16
the Christian faith it's just that my

9516.2 --> 9522.92
version of my Christian faith is really

9519.16 --> 9525.84
trusting in the wisdom and the power of

9522.92 --> 9528.8
of Christ and his words and not what

9525.84 --> 9532.439
other people say even though follow them

9528.8 --> 9535.16
as if they were were me yeah

9532.439 --> 9538.04
uh I'm only going to follow them as if

9535.16 --> 9541.84
they were you if they actually reflect

9538.04 --> 9543.92
your wisdom and don't just continu into

9541.84 --> 9547.960000000001
an off track that no longer is

9543.92 --> 9552.08
esoterically compatible with your actual

9547.96 --> 9557.8
wisdom cuz Jesus may have had more faith

9552.08 --> 9560.0
in his own followers then I

9557.8 --> 9564.08
have like

9560.0 --> 9564.08
in them like

9565.16 --> 9571.479
nah right but I mean how could Jesus

9568.64 --> 9573.68
really have known from a contemporary

9571.479 --> 9576.278999999999
perspective what would

9573.68 --> 9578.439
happen with the apostles maybe he just

9576.279 --> 9582.399000000001
thought it's going to be good enough

9578.439 --> 9586.0
like maybe he trusted in

9582.399 --> 9590.56
God in the nature of the powers of in of

9586.0 --> 9593.2
the information being carried through

9590.56 --> 9595.519999999999
and and maybe he did underestimate the

9593.2 --> 9599.16
counter

9595.52 --> 9601.359
forces and what they would do with the

9599.16 --> 9603.279
arrival of the information just look at

9601.359 --> 9607.279
what's happened with Christianity and

9603.279 --> 9611.0
Catholicism and how people have learned

9607.279 --> 9616.960000000001
to perpetually bypass Jesus's wisdom in

9611.0 --> 9619.6
favor of other perspectives from within

9616.96 --> 9624.08
Christianity to the point where it it's

9619.6 --> 9629.800000000001
now common practice to basically

9624.08 --> 9632.92
violate God's law declaring him a diety

9629.8 --> 9637.759999999998
I mean that is pretty astounding that

9632.92 --> 9637.76
that's happened wouldn't you

9638.52 --> 9646.2
say I think that Jesus

9642.12 --> 9648.52
probably how D I made a mistake there

9646.2 --> 9651.68
but it might have been a mistake that he

9648.52 --> 9655.6
couldn't bypass

9651.68 --> 9657.439
because if the story is correct he knew

9655.6 --> 9662.52
he was going to

9657.439 --> 9666.04
die so he wasn't incapable of developing

9662.52 --> 9669.319000000001
the wisdom beyond that point in

9666.04 --> 9673.0
time so he would have had to rely on

9669.319 --> 9673.0
others to continue it for

9673.68 --> 9679.84
him but maybe he had a little bit too

9676.96 --> 9682.358999999999
much hope if such a thing really exists

9679.84 --> 9684.24
in that they would be able to continue

9682.359 --> 9688.279
his level of

9684.24 --> 9691.16
wisdom when to me over the ages it seems

9688.279 --> 9693.720000000001
like the the the his

9691.16 --> 9696.8
following have basically ended up

9693.72 --> 9699.72
contradicting more of his wisdom then

9696.8 --> 9703.92
they've continu

9699.72 --> 9705.88
it but that's just my personal insight

9703.92 --> 9708.24
and

9705.88 --> 9711.24
[Music]

9708.24 --> 9711.24
opinion

9716.279 --> 9720.08
yeah thanks for that double zap I think

9718.6 --> 9723.319
everybody's well

9720.08 --> 9723.319
aware by

9725.52 --> 9728.979000000001
[Music]

9738.16 --> 9741.16
now

9746.359 --> 9753.279
coder of the universe enters the server

9748.399 --> 9753.278999999999
yeah which is nonsense debatable

9753.68 --> 9757.04
D no he

9758.04 --> 9766.640000000001
doesn't yeah Jesus is not God not

9763.84 --> 9767.92
literally he's arguably the closest that

9766.64 --> 9771.119999999999
has ever

9767.92 --> 9771.12
been the

9775.76 --> 9781.880000000001
Messiah but I mean if you can only get

9779.279 --> 9787.68
to the father through

9781.88 --> 9790.599999999999
him how does that mean that he is the

9787.68 --> 9792.76
father why would he then

9790.6 --> 9795.12
differentiate between the father and

9792.76 --> 9799.880000000001
himself why wouldn't he just

9795.12 --> 9802.800000000001
say you want God here he is

9799.88 --> 9804.96
yeah you want god

9802.8 --> 9810.119999999999
well I am

9804.96 --> 9813.64
it no through me so God another thing

9810.12 --> 9815.68
then you know but I mean yeah now we're

9813.64 --> 9817.119999999999
going to go into like Trinity debacle

9815.68 --> 9819.92
and it's probably going to trigger a

9817.12 --> 9819.92
whole bunch of more

9821.68 --> 9827.16
people the father and the son are one

9825.08 --> 9830.56
then why are they two different

9827.16 --> 9834.6
specified words that then have to be

9830.56 --> 9834.6
reunified by declaring them

9835.88 --> 9841.199999999999
one hey these two separate things that

9838.88 --> 9845.88
are definitely two different separate

9841.2 --> 9848.880000000001
things they're one yeah remember that

9845.88 --> 9852.92
these two specifically named separate

9848.88 --> 9856.278999999999
things are one really really that makes

9852.92 --> 9860.960000000001
sense it's like two is

9856.279 --> 9866.359
one okay that's not correct according to

9860.96 --> 9866.358999999999
math but I guess that's what you believe

9888.04 --> 9891.04
in

9898.52 --> 9904.2
my idea of Jesus sounds very in line

9900.8 --> 9906.519999999999
with what Islam says about Jesus yeah I

9904.2 --> 9908.16
think that Islam is closer to the

9906.52 --> 9911.399000000001
reality of

9908.16 --> 9914.84
it than modern Christianity which is

9911.399 --> 9916.76
heavily heavily influenced and changed

9914.84 --> 9921.16
provably changed

9916.76 --> 9921.16
altered by Catholicism by the

9924.12 --> 9929.800000000001
Romans look at how much the Romans have

9927.16 --> 9931.24
changed they literally changed time

9929.8 --> 9933.88
itself the

9931.24 --> 9936.399
calendar they changed history the

9933.88 --> 9939.56
Jesuits came out of it look at what they

9936.399 --> 9942.039999999999
all changed they freaking erased history

9939.56 --> 9944.64
rewrote it there's so much change that

9942.04 --> 9946.640000000001
has been caused by

9944.64 --> 9950.439
them

9946.64 --> 9954.519999999999
Islam seems to have been

9950.439 --> 9958.24
very unchanged in the face of Roman

9954.52 --> 9958.24
influence throughout the

9961.6 --> 9965.880000000001
Millennium and they're very fanatic

9964.08 --> 9968.96
about not

9965.88 --> 9972.24
changing which in my opinion makes them

9968.96 --> 9972.24
a more reliable

9977.92 --> 9980.92
source

9982.88 --> 9986.759999999998
The Matrix was released 25 years ago

9985.12 --> 9990.240000000002
yeah

9986.76 --> 9990.24
yeah yeah what a

9990.56 --> 9994.76
movie movie that changed my life

9995.399 --> 10002.88
forever like just by the style of

10000.04 --> 10008.279
it when I saw the Matrix like I knew

10002.88 --> 10009.88
like that that is the look that is my

10008.279 --> 10014.359
style

10009.88 --> 10018.96
no more spiky nonsense no more color

10014.359 --> 10018.960000000001
combies like that that's

10024.68 --> 10031.24
it and the movie itself for like all the

10027.76 --> 10035.800000000001
metaphors of Consciousness

10031.24 --> 10038.039999999999
and yeah of course that maor impactful

10035.8 --> 10040.84
but not the first one to do that but it

10038.04 --> 10040.84
they did it very

10050.72 --> 10058.56
eloquently oh wow randomly picked it up

10055.56 --> 10058.56
yeah

10067.84 --> 10070.84
amazing

10078.98 --> 10082.16
[Music]

10080.16 --> 10083.52
okay

10082.16 --> 10087.399
[Music]

10083.52 --> 10087.399000000001
boy I'm sure he

10088.08 --> 10095.56
is how dare you he's not the real God

10091.359 --> 10095.56
I'm not going to poize

10096.24 --> 10100.479
anything right or or you could do it

10099.399 --> 10105.0
like me and

10100.479 --> 10105.0
just God is truth Satan is

10108.2 --> 10114.0
lies and so if they hold truth then that

10112.12 --> 10117.68
truth is

10114.0 --> 10120.64
God and if they hold obvious provable

10117.68 --> 10124.720000000001
lies then that is

10120.64 --> 10127.72
Satan so I figure out things and

10124.72 --> 10129.438999999998
determine where they're at by those

10127.72 --> 10132.199999999999
standards

10129.439 --> 10136.64
and to be fair it to me it seems like

10132.2 --> 10136.640000000001
the Bible has more Satan in it than

10137.68 --> 10143.76
Islam more political man-made

10140.479 --> 10143.76
alterations more

10144.8 --> 10149.64
manipulations and the truth might not

10147.24 --> 10152.56
always be

10149.64 --> 10156.199999999999
likable especially as time

10152.56 --> 10156.199999999999
passes but it is

10157.72 --> 10160.72
true

10180.239 --> 10183.96
wow okay borders boy yeah that's all

10182.52 --> 10187.0
very

10183.96 --> 10190.64
cute it's it's really kind of pathetic

10187.0 --> 10190.64
to equate all of that

10190.76 --> 10196.359
I mean you didn't even get it

10193.96 --> 10199.919999999998
right

10196.359 --> 10203.880000000001
Allah is is just

10199.92 --> 10207.439
Arabic it's just Arabic for God it's not

10203.88 --> 10211.08
the name of the

10207.439 --> 10214.359
god which proves that your

10211.08 --> 10217.359
entire statement there is just

10214.359 --> 10217.359
completely

10217.64 --> 10222.358999999999
wrong

10220.279 --> 10227.960000000001
yeah all these other

10222.359 --> 10230.92
words don't mean God Allah is just

10227.96 --> 10234.16
Arabic for

10230.92 --> 10236.479
God which proves that you in that very

10234.16 --> 10238.52
moment don't know what the hell you're

10236.479 --> 10243.96
talking

10238.52 --> 10243.960000000001
about yeah that's Satan to me

10247.64 --> 10254.199999999999
provably

10250.53 --> 10254.2
[Music]

10256.65 --> 10259.699999999999
[Music]

10277.52 --> 10280.52
for

10282.96 --> 10287.319
saying Jehovah is not God either well

10285.0 --> 10291.8
maybe but I think that Jehovah is

10287.319 --> 10294.119999999999
literally mentioned as a name if God

10291.8 --> 10297.759999999998
gains a

10294.12 --> 10302.0
name then to say that name as a

10297.76 --> 10304.6
representative of them is fair because

10302.0 --> 10304.6
they have a

10304.92 --> 10313.279
name but if God does not have a name and

10308.72 --> 10316.0
you're just going to use another

10313.279 --> 10320.279
language to name

10316.0 --> 10324.68
them when that language is

10320.279 --> 10328.439
simply the word for God

10324.68 --> 10328.439
then it makes no

10337.52 --> 10340.52
sense

10367.439 --> 10370.439
for

10387.359 --> 10395.92
pre ingrate Stak J

10391.12 --> 10395.92
right yeah well Mormonism has its own

10397.279 --> 10401.399000000001
weirdness but but it's interesting

10403.84 --> 10409.52
though it's interesting that they would

10406.2 --> 10409.52
go God the Father

10417.72 --> 10425.88
Elohim ah Jehovah has believed it's

10421.88 --> 10425.88
taton that's also very

10426.399 --> 10434.0
fascinating but my point

10429.64 --> 10437.96
is it's a little complicated isn't

10434.0 --> 10437.96
it it's all a little

10438.479 --> 10446.84
complicated and The Logical

10441.16 --> 10446.84
conclusion is that monotheism is

10447.399 --> 10456.239
not the denial of the existence of other

10450.88 --> 10459.039999999999
gods as Gods it's just you choose one

10456.239 --> 10460.8
and take that as

10459.04 --> 10463.800000000001
the only God to

10460.8 --> 10466.8
worship it doesn't deny the existence of

10463.8 --> 10469.039999999999
other gods as being gods it might deny

10466.8 --> 10471.399
their power or

10469.04 --> 10474.080000000002
whatever but it doesn't deny their

10471.399 --> 10476.76
existence and that was my original point

10474.08 --> 10480.399
and that spawn forth all of

10476.76 --> 10480.399
this all of this

10487.319 --> 10490.319
discussion

10496.8 --> 10499.88
yes the bable D I

10517.319 --> 10520.319
know

10529.44 --> 10533.799
[Music]

10545.04 --> 10551.0
that's right Arab Christians call him

10548.399 --> 10554.96
Allah too and that was my original Point

10551.0 --> 10559.239
like Allah is one

10554.96 --> 10561.96
of the false Gods excuse me are you

10559.239 --> 10564.76
calling Arab Christians followers of a

10561.96 --> 10567.519999999999
false god

10564.76 --> 10570.16
cuz they're

10567.52 --> 10573.640000000001
Christians they follow the Bible that

10570.16 --> 10575.52
Bible may be written in Arabic and every

10573.64 --> 10577.72
time God is mentioned they're going to

10575.52 --> 10578.800000000001
say Allah because that's the word for

10577.72 --> 10582.88
God

10578.8 --> 10582.88
and that was my

10583.04 --> 10589.52
point my criticism of borders boys

10586.8 --> 10589.519999999999
little rant

10606.8 --> 10613.679999999998
earlier h

10610.16 --> 10615.92
cool debatable thank you for that

10613.68 --> 10618.92
although yeah that sounds like

10615.92 --> 10621.960000000001
descriptions titles that are given to

10618.92 --> 10626.359
God not the

10621.96 --> 10629.759999999998
name this are you seeing that there's no

10626.359 --> 10632.76
names in there it is

10629.76 --> 10632.76
descriptions

10632.8 --> 10640.16
attributes titles not

10637.16 --> 10640.16
name

10652.16 --> 10656.96
still going then yeah hey welcome back

10654.439 --> 10656.960000000001
here we go

10664.2 --> 10669.560000000001
again depends on the translation or

10666.68 --> 10672.64
context well no not really because from

10669.56 --> 10672.64
what you've said

10674.96 --> 10681.278999999999
there

10677.04 --> 10683.68
right to him belong the best

10681.279 --> 10688.0
names well that's not a name that's a

10683.68 --> 10692.319
description the entirely merciful that's

10688.0 --> 10694.479
a a description a title of an attribute

10692.319 --> 10697.039999999999
the especially merciful that's also a

10694.479 --> 10700.119999999999
description an attribute none of them

10697.04 --> 10700.12
are names

10702.399 --> 10705.0
they're

10711.439 --> 10716.64
titles like does the

10717.08 --> 10722.84
designer the God not of this world does

10720.64 --> 10728.76
he have a

10722.84 --> 10730.92
name or do only the Elohim have names

10728.76 --> 10730.92
the

10733.68 --> 10740.16
Shapers these are the type of questions

10736.239 --> 10740.16
that I I I Ponder

10750.0 --> 10753.64
upon all right anyway I do appreciate

10752.68 --> 10756.64
the

10753.64 --> 10759.439
uh the the yeah the

10756.64 --> 10761.92
uh argument ative contribution there

10759.439 --> 10764.279
debatable D it's very informative thank

10761.92 --> 10764.279
you for

10769.319 --> 10772.96
that right I'm going to take a

10771.439 --> 10775.880000000001
two-minute break and then probably going

10772.96 --> 10778.16
to move towards rounding out show be

10775.88 --> 10778.16
right

10780.97 --> 10784.019999999999
[Music]

10787.04 --> 10790.04
back

10816.96 --> 10819.96
e

10846.92 --> 10849.92
e

10876.92 --> 10879.92
e

10896.08 --> 10901.359
oh a bit pointless no no your comment is

10899.6 --> 10906.399000000001
a bit

10901.359 --> 10906.399000000001
pointless cuz you haven't contributed

10906.84 --> 10910.56
anything

10908.64 --> 10913.039999999999
genuine

10910.56 --> 10915.278999999999
chlorop not saying anything and then

10913.04 --> 10916.04
your comment is all a bit pointless no

10915.279 --> 10919.800000000001
it

10916.04 --> 10922.68
isn't was quite pointful everything that

10919.8 --> 10924.96
debatable D has shared with us

10922.68 --> 10930.359
especially to counter this ridiculous

10924.96 --> 10933.919999999998
idea that Allah is one of the dieties of

10930.359 --> 10936.52
the false dieties like which is a highly

10933.92 --> 10936.52
ignorant

10936.84 --> 10939.84
statement

10942.64 --> 10947.92
Mormonism views Father Son and Holy

10945.04 --> 10950.439
Spirit is three distinct beings yeah and

10947.92 --> 10950.439
so do

10951.56 --> 10958.399
I they are they're not one thing the the

10955.56 --> 10961.76
whole three or one one or

10958.399 --> 10961.76
three that's

10963.76 --> 10969.84
basically like a

10966.84 --> 10969.84
cultist

10975.52 --> 10983.52
like it bypasses logic when it bypasses

10979.16 --> 10983.52
logic can't be of God

10988.8 --> 10995.679999999998
anymore if you can't take it literal

10993.2 --> 10997.880000000001
anymore because if you take it literal

10995.68 --> 11001.04
it couldn't be true it would start to

10997.88 --> 11004.8
contradict itself then it can't be

11001.04 --> 11004.800000000001
true can't be of

11017.52 --> 11024.08
God weird by the way that they didn't

11020.439 --> 11024.08
give the Holy Spirit his own

11026.72 --> 11029.72
name

11039.319 --> 11042.68
what posts yeah

11056.72 --> 11059.72
yeah

11069.2 --> 11075.319000000001
mystery religion I mean Richard G at

11072.08 --> 11077.96
what point isn't all of this a big

11075.319 --> 11077.96
mystery

11078.56 --> 11084.76
religion but yeah I mean Jordan Maxwell

11082.12 --> 11088.319000000001
had all these types of I mean Jordan Max

11084.76 --> 11091.960000000001
is what spawned forth this idea

11088.319 --> 11091.96
that's why this discussion

11092.399 --> 11099.64
started it's because of Jordan Maxwell

11095.76 --> 11103.6
Maxwell's statement that monotheism

11099.64 --> 11106.68
isn't about one God only existing it's

11103.6 --> 11111.479000000001
about choosing

11106.68 --> 11114.64
monism choosing one God over others not

11111.479 --> 11118.64
denying those others exist that's what

11114.64 --> 11120.16
spawned forth this entire discussion

11118.64 --> 11125.239
is Jordan

11120.16 --> 11125.239
Maxwell I've been watching a lot of his

11125.64 --> 11131.239
Rams in the recent few weeks and they

11128.359 --> 11133.960000000001
have been very interesting very

11131.239 --> 11136.039999999999
interesting to watch that again also

11133.96 --> 11138.519999999999
hilarious when he starts to talk about

11136.04 --> 11141.84
all the mysterious structures on Mars

11138.52 --> 11144.92
and it's like that is so funny it's so

11141.84 --> 11147.76
funny to me now but like beside that

11144.92 --> 11148.68
stuff it is all still very interesting

11147.76 --> 11153.52
like

11148.68 --> 11153.52
his his esoteric Insight

11153.64 --> 11160.68
on on Genesis and the Mystery religions

11158.04 --> 11162.640000000001
and the ancient past like he has a lot

11160.68 --> 11167.800000000001
of very interesting things to say about

11162.64 --> 11167.8
it that make you think they very

11171.17 --> 11174.299
[Music]

11176.56 --> 11179.56
stimulating

11182.04 --> 11190.04
and he's not always correct by the

11185.239 --> 11190.039999999999
way he makes some very fundamental

11206.52 --> 11209.52
mistakes

11223.92 --> 11228.960000000001
halot

11226.12 --> 11232.84
interesting I remember the use of that

11228.96 --> 11234.438999999998
word okay debatable dig you can slow

11232.84 --> 11238.399
down now it looks like you're like

11234.439 --> 11239.68
rolling out an entire Wikipedia page

11238.399 --> 11242.278999999999
it's

11239.68 --> 11245.460000000001
okay I thank you for the contribution

11242.279 --> 11249.51
but I think we've got enough

11245.46 --> 11249.509999999998
[Music]

11261.479 --> 11266.599999999999
now yeah yeah I love that one the

11264.56 --> 11268.359
reference I am the Alpha and the Omega

11266.6 --> 11271.800000000001
the first and the last beginning and the

11268.359 --> 11275.52
end which really emphasizes him being

11271.8 --> 11278.84
outside of time or master of time if

11275.52 --> 11282.399000000001
you're master of time and change then

11278.84 --> 11285.880000000001
you're probably not part of the

11282.399 --> 11288.92
world so that connects it for me to

11285.88 --> 11290.72
Jesus's reference my father is not of

11288.92 --> 11295.04
this

11290.72 --> 11299.438999999998
world that's just how I connect

11295.04 --> 11299.439
that logically

11303.0 --> 11307.92
he knows his stuff he certainly does

11305.0 --> 11307.92
seem to

11311.6 --> 11319.12
yeah de bable is uh it's been very

11314.76 --> 11319.12
interesting your input thank you for all

11321.76 --> 11327.92
that can type Hebrew who is this guy

11324.88 --> 11330.88
well he probably has a whole bunch of

11327.92 --> 11333.56
documents on his computer because he did

11330.88 --> 11337.278999999999
elaborate research on it and he's

11333.56 --> 11341.16
just he's got it at the

11337.279 --> 11341.16
ready to copy and

11341.6 --> 11346.800000000001
paste that's what I

11344.08 --> 11350.52
suspect so it's got just good stored

11346.8 --> 11350.519999999999
sources on his computer which is

11356.359 --> 11359.359
admirable

11368.16 --> 11373.6
indeed right but uh yeah it's past 6

11371.359 --> 11373.6
here

11375.8 --> 11381.56
now still light outside but yeah it's

11379.76 --> 11386.319
it's also rained in the

11381.56 --> 11389.319
meantime a bit so yeah weather could be

11386.319 --> 11389.319
better

11390.64 --> 11396.92
copy paste from Wikipedia

11393.239 --> 11400.279
okay I guess Wikipedia does

11396.92 --> 11403.960000000001
uh does have some

11400.279 --> 11407.399000000001
