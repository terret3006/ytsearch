[Music]

38.059 --> 47.01
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

41.73 --> 51.39
early-bird number 200 right yeah

47.01 --> 53.339
it's number 200 yep I'm your host

51.39 --> 55.980000000000004
Arwen and before we start the show

53.339 --> 59.699
please don't forget to share it on any

55.98 --> 61.44
platform you deem fit and yeah subscribe

59.699 --> 63.059
to my channel if you haven't already hit

61.44 --> 64.77
the bell notification so you know what

63.059 --> 70.289
I'm going live which is normally 2:00

64.77 --> 73.89
p.m. amsterdam time right so the weather

70.289 --> 78.39
today is it's kind of nice it's it's

73.89 --> 85.5
very warm but windy and a bit cloudy I

78.39 --> 88.92
haven't seen much Sun but and yet there

85.5 --> 92.64
was no night I'll show yesterday it

88.92 --> 94.53
would have been great but I was just not

92.64 --> 98.759
feeling great I still don't feel all

94.53 --> 103.56
that great yeah it's cold symptoms

98.759 --> 106.56
basically and I kind of felt it coming

103.56 --> 108.929
for a while because I was yeah like

106.56 --> 112.229
signs of rage you know that impatience

108.929 --> 114.81
and then going with it typically as a

112.229 --> 117.479
sign that something like this happens at

114.81 --> 121.17
some point sooner or later so it was

117.479 --> 124.679
kind of expecting it this is the swing

121.17 --> 130.8
of the pendulum and I don't know it

124.679 --> 134.61
could be a lot worse I am basically just

130.8 --> 138.12
feeling trouble and all this you had the

134.61 --> 140.76000000000002
points that have received some kind of

138.12 --> 144.33
blow one way or another so like one time

140.76 --> 147.14999999999998
for example I was inhaling a joint and

144.33 --> 150.33
like choked on it it rarely rarely

147.15 --> 154.08
rarely happens but yeah when I do it can

150.33 --> 158.06
really hurt and so now I can't yeah feel

154.08 --> 158.06
an echo of it typically happens

160.01 --> 169.23
yeah I don't know it's to me it's just

163.61 --> 171.27
what is it a medical a metabolic Oh

169.23 --> 174.04999999999998
overhaul basically that's what it's

171.27 --> 176.75
doing just on my lymph nodes or just

174.05 --> 180.51000000000002
trying to work it out

176.75 --> 184.53
basically reorganizing things and that's

180.51 --> 186.019
how I approach it and I know it's not

184.53 --> 189.209
gonna be too bad

186.019 --> 190.92000000000002
but yeah I do get tired a lot quicker so

189.209 --> 194.459
having like in the middle of the night

190.92 --> 197.39999999999998
at 3:00 hour no no way

194.459 --> 200.91
I slept a lot yesterday like right after

197.4 --> 204.15
the show I slept woke up again slept

200.91 --> 207.78
pretty early in the night oh wow

204.15 --> 212.75
oh hello ego playing an anchor thanks

207.78 --> 212.75

212.989 --> 222.269
thank you

215.72 --> 225.42
yeah so no p1000 marathon yet I'm gonna

222.269 --> 230.13
wait until I'm better at least like fall

225.42 --> 235.61999999999998
back to strength again fresh yeah thanks

230.13 --> 240.45
man so yeah let's go over who is in chat

235.62 --> 243.739
besides ego playing an anchor so drunken

240.45 --> 250.39999999999998
bullet for one one glass jaw over moco

243.739 --> 256.73900000000003
James Mays pumpkin puffs Johnson am i UK

250.4 --> 262.039
Jason McCormack Jason James Mason how to

256.739 --> 262.039
kill the hope James Mays

263.57 --> 269.27
good to see you all and no I have not

268.07 --> 273.37
seen somebody else

269.27 --> 278.27
stop trying to troll me please

273.37 --> 284.27
peanuts Clark yes that's true

278.27 --> 286.66999999999996
but it's okay look I still it's let me

284.27 --> 290.33
explain the more some of the more

286.67 --> 294.02000000000004
complicated new details but sort of the

290.33 --> 298.46
set up because yeah I'm look when I came

294.02 --> 301.7
to this room I was basically yeah dumped

298.46 --> 305.35999999999996
by my ex and with that that I certainly

301.7 --> 309.32
had to get no way to pay back ran out of

305.36 --> 312.68
money and yeah had to radically

309.32 --> 314.63
basically alter my life and the way I do

312.68 --> 317.99
things which is very tough on me

314.63 --> 321.8
got into this but I still have that debt

317.99 --> 323.54
and I yeah because I don't have extra

321.8 --> 325.22
income officially really they didn't

323.54 --> 328.40000000000003
touch it but I think that what I may

325.22 --> 330.86
have done I hope so I'm gonna have to

328.4 --> 337.13
check this out is that they basically

330.86 --> 340.07
took it away then yeah take that money

337.13 --> 342.71
and basically scratch it off against the

340.07 --> 345.64
debt and that happened before like my

342.71 --> 348.32
dad now is probably half of what it was

345.64 --> 350.12
originally when I moved here because of

348.32 --> 352.46
these types of actions which were always

350.12 --> 355.64
extremely inconvenient every time that

352.46 --> 358.64
happens but yeah okay at least that that

355.64 --> 361.90999999999997
goes away so maybe in that way it is in

358.64 --> 363.59
a complete waste of money what I guess

361.91 --> 365.54
through Google I don't know yet but on

363.59 --> 369.46999999999997
the short run yet not so much

365.54 --> 371.51000000000005
unfortunately at least but yeah let's

369.47 --> 373.40000000000003
not I'm not gonna be a bummer about it

371.51 --> 376.13
thanks anyway for a super chat donation

373.4 --> 378.40999999999997
big donation hasn't happened anything

376.13 --> 381.89
like that in a long time so thanks much

378.41 --> 387.23
appreciate it I'm not gonna be an ass so

381.89 --> 389.46
I got some tea not a lot oh yeah I got

387.23 --> 392.13
myself some orange juice

389.46 --> 394.04999999999995
it's really you so and ya know Tamera

392.13 --> 396.48
coffee like I had one cup of coffee

394.05 --> 398.43
today and that's enough like you have to

396.48 --> 401.52000000000004
I have to be very careful with coffee

398.43 --> 406.17
when I'm having a cold and but I did get

401.52 --> 409.34999999999997
this huge Apple organic apple like ya

406.17 --> 412.95
cost me over a euro but I thought yeah

409.35 --> 415.29
let's do that I rarely eat fruit but for

412.95 --> 416.58
some reason when I do get a cold I may

415.29 --> 420.39000000000004
be its condition

416.58 --> 423.84
I'm just used when I had a cold when I

420.39 --> 428.64
was a kid my mother always made like

423.84 --> 430.34999999999997
these incredible fruits things and I

428.64 --> 432.09
loved it and it was very good and I

430.35 --> 435.39000000000004
would get get better a lot quicker so

432.09 --> 439.16999999999996
that's why I justice yeah yeah hunger

435.39 --> 440.76
for fresh fruit which I yeah to be fair

439.17 --> 445.59000000000003
I don't eat a lot cuz it's very

440.76 --> 449.64
expensive organic and I don't know it

445.59 --> 454.89
just don't feel like it a lot I don't

449.64 --> 459.63
know how my my food decisions have like

454.89 --> 463.52
their own weird program intuitively I do

459.63 --> 466.59
it intuitively and it definitely works

463.52 --> 468.84
if I'm not overstressed but when I'm

466.59 --> 470.4
overstressed then these judgments can be

468.84 --> 474.91999999999996
very difficult because there's something

470.4 --> 479.72999999999996
in the way to be very still to properly

474.92 --> 486.36
figure it out but yeah I've been doing

479.73 --> 489.41
great with the tight budget so anyway

486.36 --> 489.41
I'm gonna take a bite of that

496.9 --> 500.83
that's really good

503.98 --> 515.8100000000001
barely sour but not entirely sour --less

507.26 --> 519.11
a good deep apple aroma flavor but not

515.81 --> 521.05
like the type that typically seems like

519.11 --> 526.79
it's artificial even though it's not a

521.05 --> 529.27
really natural apple taste and just yeah

526.79 --> 532.64
just the right amount of sugar for me

529.27 --> 534.53
naturally I loved it great I'm a really

532.64 --> 537.4399999999999
good choice on the apples there were a

534.53 --> 546.38
lot of different apples and this one

537.44 --> 554.1500000000001
just call out to me now they're

546.38 --> 556.25
definitely not seedless and I don't know

554.15 --> 559.97
even if the seedless apples are GMO

556.25 --> 566.2
necessarily they can just be bred like

559.97 --> 566.2
that now yeah naturally so

589.11 --> 601.96
now be careful with them the playing

592.42 --> 613.41
around I'm not gonna be able to finish

601.96 --> 613.4100000000001
this entirely but it's nice

615.18 --> 629.3199999999999
yep yeah that Apple definitely tasted

620.71 --> 632.0500000000001
like a real Apple I don't know but yeah

629.32 --> 634.0
I'm you might have noticed I may be a

632.05 --> 638.3199999999999
little bit slower than usual and I feel

634.0 --> 641.14
a bit woozy so I just I thought like

638.32 --> 643.9300000000001
yeah yeah I'm kind of sick

641.14 --> 646.15
I should probably cancel it but I don't

643.93 --> 649.3299999999999
know it the shows just so engrained in

646.15 --> 651.22
me that just like two hours before it

649.33 --> 653.2
starts like oh I have to get ready and

651.22 --> 656.35
I'm like yeah but should I and I got all

653.2 --> 660.88
this energy I just had like I can't not

656.35 --> 662.89
do it right now like unless I would

660.88 --> 664.87
really be totally out of it and have a

662.89 --> 666.46
headache and I don't have a really a

664.87 --> 672.28
headache I'm just a slightly bit woozy

666.46 --> 675.82
so if it gets worse then yeah I'm gonna

672.28 --> 679.0799999999999
have to take a break but for now I'm

675.82 --> 679.08
doing I'm doing fine

692.43 --> 696.26
[Music]

693.73 --> 701.5
now there's nothing really that proves

696.26 --> 704.72
gravity but you can presuppose it and

701.5 --> 707.6
then basically define everything

704.72 --> 711.26
physically through that or with that as

707.6 --> 712.76
an aid and it works out very nicely but

711.26 --> 714.95
there's nothing really that can prove it

712.76 --> 716.96
because yeah you can change you can't

714.95 --> 722.48
change the independent variable Chris

716.96 --> 740.96
Matt hey sleeping word good morning or

722.48 --> 743.3000000000001
good afternoon yeah I did watch a bit of

740.96 --> 747.71
that over mu cool I'm Martin Anita can't

743.3 --> 752.8399999999999
take it but yeah my head wasn't really

747.71 --> 753.5600000000001
added and I don't know there's issues

752.84 --> 755.39
too

753.56 --> 759.05
like I'd been following Martin for a

755.39 --> 763.37
long time and I'm starting to see

759.05 --> 766.4
certain patterns and let's just play it

763.37 --> 768.86
like this I don't know it seems like

766.4 --> 772.13
Martin has constructed certain

768.86 --> 773.54
narratives and he's basically or well

772.13 --> 778.3
maybe he didn't construct it's like

773.54 --> 780.68
conceived thought up in a sense that I

778.3 --> 785.3599999999999
don't think that the mudflats

780.68 --> 787.7299999999999
really happened uniformly worldwide like

785.36 --> 790.46
Martin often suggests oh by the way

787.73 --> 793.54
thank you Fe news for that to suit

790.46 --> 799.25
dollar super donation Thanks

793.54 --> 800.92
so yeah I don't think that the mud flood

799.25 --> 804.35
as he said really happened I've heard

800.92 --> 807.5899999999999
yeah people who know about old-fashioned

804.35 --> 809.5400000000001
building designs among leb basically

807.59 --> 813.98
says no it was very specifically

809.54 --> 816.87
designed like that for yeah because of

813.98 --> 821.379
the classes each view back then

816.87 --> 825.699
that sounded like really very detailed

821.379 --> 828.5790000000001
and logical I had like I don't know it's

825.699 --> 831.3389999999999
just the way he described it and he's

828.579 --> 834.7589999999999
not gonna lie about like his his

831.339 --> 837.85
profession or he's serious and just like

834.759 --> 841.0
yeah you can go against that really you

837.85 --> 843.9390000000001
know you can think of alibies ideas

841.0 --> 846.49
about the the supposed bodies that could

843.939 --> 848.92
potentially be out there is ideas about

846.49 --> 851.17
that are maybe a bit wacky but yeah

848.92 --> 856.3
who's to speak you know I believe in a

851.17 --> 859.959
looping special realm so or that could

856.3 --> 861.49
be possible potentially and he's just

859.959 --> 864.16
yeah that's how he does it but that

861.49 --> 867.37
piece of information like really woke me

864.16 --> 871.12
up in a way to the idea of the mud flood

867.37 --> 875.339
and I don't think I think there probably

871.12 --> 880.779
were certain mud flats it's like

875.339 --> 884.3190000000001
especially with st. Petersburg and also

880.779 --> 886.689
that entire area how that area is it

884.319 --> 890.319
kind of made more sense to me like that

886.689 --> 892.509
that that would potentially happen under

890.319 --> 901.8389999999999
certain circumstances there but you know

892.509 --> 912.6990000000001
the other regions I don't know so I yeah

901.839 --> 914.11
evidence there is sure what you yeah

912.699 --> 915.519
you're still talking about flatters I

914.11 --> 920.0500000000001
was talking about the mullet for a

915.519 --> 922.509
moment but still you have the star force

920.05 --> 927.3389999999999
oh my god the star force

922.509 --> 931.8000000000001
now that's something else that is some

927.339 --> 937.87
really fascinating [ __ ] and I think that

931.8 --> 940.959
it probably has to do with well the

937.87 --> 945.97
tertiary names and and tartarean age

940.959 --> 948.189
secret antiquity like they had secret

945.97 --> 949.9590000000001
technology weapon development that was

948.189 --> 951.939
kept from the public for military

949.959 --> 953.649
reasons just like we do you have to

951.939 --> 958.139
think of it like that there was public

953.649 --> 961.629
stuff with technology probably maybe

958.139 --> 964.48
communications electricity using the

961.629 --> 966.009
atmospheric electricity for purposes but

964.48 --> 968.259
of course there were military

966.009 --> 970.029
applications of this that would be as

968.259 --> 974.139
much hidden as possible so that people

970.029 --> 975.819
don't get crazy ideas or could

974.139 --> 978.009
potentially figure out what's going on

975.819 --> 979.75
when they actually use it but I think

978.009 --> 984.339
that designers of the Star Force were

979.75 --> 986.8
aware of these military secret level

984.339 --> 989.62
Tartarian technologies including what

986.8 --> 991.7199999999999
what Martin says might be the fascists

989.62 --> 995.889
in that direction some electromagnetic

991.72 --> 999.24
weapon and that I think that the idea of

995.889 --> 1003.439
star Ford being designed to accommodate

999.24 --> 1006.12
for that type of technically very valid

1003.439 --> 1010.139
so see it's not everything just that

1006.12 --> 1012.3
it's just the mud the mud flooding like

1010.139 --> 1015.629
I don't really go with that but all the

1012.3 --> 1020.279
other things oh yeah there's a lot very

1015.629 --> 1026.189
interesting things going on in the

1020.279 --> 1027.14
they're not too far past so that's about

1026.189 --> 1029.72
that

1027.14 --> 1032.3290000000002
mmm it is among the hashtags in my

1029.72 --> 1035.02
description block so should talk about

1032.329 --> 1035.02
it sometimes

1042.52 --> 1050.09
well peanuts Clark look a way to they

1047.689 --> 1052.4
could have done it back then it simply

1050.09 --> 1055.76
have devices everywhere that people

1052.4 --> 1057.89
don't really know how to use and they

1055.76 --> 1060.799
would sit the controllers of the

1057.89 --> 1062.8700000000001
military then the military unit that

1060.799 --> 1066.49
would have access to the heavy stuff

1062.87 --> 1069.9799999999998
would have devices that would basically

1066.49 --> 1071.809
be compatible with general things out

1069.98 --> 1073.22
there that would normally not function

1071.809 --> 1077.1499999999999
and then you add a component and

1073.22 --> 1081.5
suddenly it becomes a tool that's a very

1077.15 --> 1083.51
smart way to apply heavy technology

1081.5 --> 1088.429
stuff and if you have full control over

1083.51 --> 1092.45
design of of what's going on so yeah

1088.429 --> 1094.76
that I think that would be a potential

1092.45 --> 1098.809
thing that would have been going on back

1094.76 --> 1100.76
then and then eventually if the people

1098.809 --> 1103.8799999999999
that had that secret knowledge how to

1100.76 --> 1106.46
apply the extra things now yeah they

1103.88 --> 1110.66
would be going away or they would all be

1106.46 --> 1113.0900000000001
they would all die and then suddenly

1110.66 --> 1116.15
like nobody really understood anymore

1113.09 --> 1118.12
what everything how it worked and just

1116.15 --> 1120.47
started to move on with their lives and

1118.12 --> 1122.36
didn't really know like okay yeah

1120.47 --> 1124.91
there's all these this must be like art

1122.36 --> 1127.01
eventually the next generations we just

1124.91 --> 1128.3600000000001
think it's just the artistic style for

1127.01 --> 1130.22
how we do things and then eventually

1128.36 --> 1134.6899999999998
controllers and ambitious people would

1130.22 --> 1140.38
say we we're gonna reform it in a new

1134.69 --> 1140.38
way more a modern way think about it

1141.96 --> 1147.4
doesn't that make sense in a programming

1145.26 --> 1150.64
kind of way over some generations

1147.4 --> 1150.64
[Music]

1168.08 --> 1175.47
destroying Hawaiian island and that star

1171.69 --> 1179.52
Ford I don't know I'm not too sure I

1175.47 --> 1181.679
look I haven't seen the full video

1179.52 --> 1183.87
Martin put out I think I only saw half

1181.679 --> 1187.23
of it so I I don't know I have to see

1183.87 --> 1192.54
those pictures but if I had to base it

1187.23 --> 1194.91
on pure speculation I'd say that the

1192.54 --> 1198.87
star forts were a big attempt to account

1194.91 --> 1200.8500000000001
for things but yeah there's potentially

1198.87 --> 1203.1299999999999
like an overkill option that would

1200.85 --> 1204.9289999999999
simply just wipe out an entire region

1203.13 --> 1207.42
that would have yeah that they would

1204.929 --> 1210.72
have also had that they never used until

1207.42 --> 1216.0
they used it and then everything went to

1210.72 --> 1217.8600000000001
[ __ ] so yeah just because they try to

1216.0 --> 1219.75
accommodate for the secret technologies

1217.86 --> 1221.1899999999998
doesn't mean that it was completely

1219.75 --> 1224.96
impervious and that they had full

1221.19 --> 1224.96
knowledge of what was possible with it

1229.28 --> 1234.72
who knows maybe maybe in a way the star

1232.77 --> 1237.179
forts were even designed by the ones

1234.72 --> 1239.58
that had the weaponry in case that it

1237.179 --> 1242.8400000000001
would fall in enemy hands that's also a

1239.58 --> 1242.84
possible way to approach it

1259.539 --> 1265.629
mmm-hmm a Jose yes thanks

1289.69 --> 1293.8
and a flat Chad's matter indeed well

1291.82 --> 1302.74
yeah I'm looking a bit for inspiration

1293.8 --> 1306.0
and look I'm still a bit woozy so just

1302.74 --> 1306.0
looking what you're talking about

1315.67 --> 1324.64
hmm hat sleeping warrior right but to

1322.1 --> 1329.33
give him some credit he does actually

1324.64 --> 1333.5
set up more decent debate opportunities

1329.33 --> 1335.51
with flatter stirs as well it's just

1333.5 --> 1338.36
that the ballers always keep on hanging

1335.51 --> 1341.51
around there because it's their safe

1338.36 --> 1343.82
space or it can be as long as they're

1341.51 --> 1352.01
not not too many flat earthers getting

1343.82 --> 1356.12
in there I think that Jose is running a

1352.01 --> 1358.85
decent show it's not making any

1356.12 --> 1362.4399999999998
scientific progress or even progress of

1358.85 --> 1365.12
understanding but it is like a decent

1362.44 --> 1370.67
platformer with opportunities rather I

1365.12 --> 1375.9199999999998
see it rather like that because if you

1370.67 --> 1380.8400000000001
really want to debate the ballers and I

1375.92 --> 1382.94
just get them on your show then Jose

1380.84 --> 1388.3999999999999
will definitely provide you a good

1382.94 --> 1392.5700000000002
opportunity he's done that with me and I

1388.4 --> 1398.5
very much appreciate that low audio and

1392.57 --> 1398.5
no I don't think so that's not me

1404.48 --> 1414.88
oh right yeah sleep yeah sleeping

1411.11 --> 1414.8799999999999
warrior yeah that Shawn guy I

1415.9 --> 1422.69
yeah I've warned Jose about it and he

1419.93 --> 1423.53
does realize it it's just that when it's

1422.69 --> 1425.54
all ballers

1423.53 --> 1428.27
Shawn just gets in there like a freaking

1425.54 --> 1433.31
tick just sneaks in there every freakin

1428.27 --> 1435.53
time but if he gets like really in the

1433.31 --> 1438.11
way of constructive conversations then

1435.53 --> 1441.59
Jose does treat him a little bit more

1438.11 --> 1443.6
strictly these days I think so it's just

1441.59 --> 1447.77
that yeah not a lot of flat-earthers

1443.6 --> 1454.07
getting the bigger panels usually maybe

1447.77 --> 1456.17
one you really think so at the atom ikan

1454.07 --> 1459.1899999999998
well I don't really know how much came

1456.17 --> 1463.3700000000001
through but I was like pretty brutally

1459.19 --> 1466.4
we were like basically virtual yeah

1463.37 --> 1470.1499999999999
virtually like shoulder bumping and like

1466.4 --> 1473.0900000000001
basically almost attacking one another

1470.15 --> 1475.4
verbally in there you probably didn't

1473.09 --> 1477.1999999999998
hear it oh I I got really pissed off

1475.4 --> 1479.96
because he was kind of like getting oh

1477.2 --> 1481.67
oh I'm gonna get you and like oh yeah

1479.96 --> 1487.94
really you're gonna get me I'm gonna

1481.67 --> 1492.3200000000002
[ __ ] yeah I said some aggressive [ __ ]

1487.94 --> 1496.51
but he was he's he's a scumbag he really

1492.32 --> 1496.51
is a scumbag the worst

1498.299 --> 1512.969
oh you want a wrench sleeping warrior

1510.019 --> 1521.1490000000001
okay well you have to abide by the rules

1512.969 --> 1524.7
then though if you know them okay so

1521.149 --> 1530.339
that's good yeah you're a good guy so

1524.7 --> 1533.599
I'll give you a wrench just don't start

1530.339 --> 1535.9189999999999
timing out people with opposing opinions

1533.599 --> 1538.049
even if they challenge you with

1535.919 --> 1541.409
something unless they're like getting

1538.049 --> 1543.45
really seriously vile and don't be

1541.409 --> 1545.0990000000002
oversensitive I'll yeah if they if

1543.45 --> 1551.82
somebody gets nasty I'll take care of

1545.099 --> 1553.859
him myself mmm although yeah if you find

1551.82 --> 1556.139
any trace of Lottie anything that is

1553.859 --> 1568.379
obviously a lot II sock instant ban

1556.139 --> 1573.289
please that's ya policy currently for

1568.379 --> 1583.7089999999998
your own protection I don't think anyone

1573.289 --> 1590.969
that has a wrench in my that has a

1583.709 --> 1593.1490000000001
wrench in my in my chat would do that to

1590.969 --> 1593.1490000000001
you

1594.94 --> 1599.44
Riley so don't worry about it anyway you

1597.549 --> 1605.249
cut the wrench anyway and we'll see what

1599.44 --> 1605.249
you're gonna do with it just terrible

1616.799 --> 1636.999
yeah all right well that there had 30

1628.09 --> 1641.039
minutes of no issues all right yeah so

1636.999 --> 1641.039
yeah at least I'm not constantly sneezy

1647.46 --> 1650.39
okay

1660.65 --> 1668.4
yeah that issue yesterday was crazy with

1664.89 --> 1671.25
Adam ikan getting a freaking strike by

1668.4 --> 1675.93
the by was it fight the Flat Earth that

1671.25 --> 1679.05
was just absurd well I don't know I

1675.93 --> 1681.9
don't remember who it was but sorry I

1679.05 --> 1688.9199999999998
wasn't all there during that that that

1681.9 --> 1693.27
hang up that debates but hey Adam I

1688.92 --> 1694.77
cannot are you gonna or wait Adam II can

1693.27 --> 1695.82
didn't get to strike it was iron real

1694.77 --> 1698.97
media that's right

1695.82 --> 1705.75
so is there gonna be an iron round this

1698.97 --> 1710.9
evening Adam I'll fight the fat girth

1705.75 --> 1710.9
yeah yeah yeah it was him okay right

1718.72 --> 1724.6000000000001
cool I'm good to hear that still on

1725.53 --> 1730.55
don't know if I'm gonna be there though

1727.73 --> 1733.21
I might go to bed really early you have

1730.55 --> 1733.21
this keeps up

1742.41 --> 1747.48
yeah Irina Columbo my dad pretty much

1749.16 --> 1757.0600000000002
he's like really even came to me with

1752.94 --> 1758.8300000000002
his own approach from things he learned

1757.06 --> 1761.77
from what he had looked up himself so

1758.83 --> 1764.23
yeah he's he's more than just like

1761.77 --> 1766.81
accepting me as a flat earth he kind of

1764.23 --> 1768.91
like really things like yeah it does

1766.81 --> 1773.6799999999998
seem like that's that seems to be the

1768.91 --> 1776.8300000000002
case I wouldn't be surprised so other

1773.68 --> 1779.19
than that not not anybody of my family

1776.83 --> 1779.1899999999998
that I know

1809.24 --> 1815.4
well God well fight the Flat Earth is

1812.37 --> 1824.87
probably gonna create a lot more drama

1815.4 --> 1829.98
because I don't know he the guy is just

1824.87 --> 1834.57
nothing there he's like doing trying to

1829.98 --> 1838.49
be professional I think it just doesn't

1834.57 --> 1838.49
seem like as hard as really even in it

1845.27 --> 1850.34
I think it's it's like absolutely

1847.88 --> 1852.95
pathetic that he strikes somebody else

1850.34 --> 1854.6899999999998
for using his material well he does that

1852.95 --> 1859.31
[ __ ] all the time it's absolutely

1854.69 --> 1863.6000000000001
ridiculous he probably didn't think it

1859.31 --> 1865.58
through or it was like a plan basically

1863.6 --> 1868.6699999999998
to see if he could start a cascade of

1865.58 --> 1871.6999999999998
banning each other just as like yeah

1868.67 --> 1873.92
that's like a plan to get get the flat

1871.7 --> 1875.8400000000001
earthers offline by basically striking

1873.92 --> 1878.93
you first luring them in and then

1875.84 --> 1880.9399999999998
striking everyone maybe that's part of

1878.93 --> 1884.0
his plan I don't know I wouldn't be

1880.94 --> 1887.06
surprised because he's just that much

1884.0 --> 1889.22
not into it so there must be a more

1887.06 --> 1892.3899999999999
important reason for him to be doing

1889.22 --> 1892.39
what he does to me

1909.42 --> 1915.54
[Music]

1912.54 --> 1915.54
breath

1922.26 --> 1929.3799999999999
hmm anyway that's why I based yeah in my

1926.919 --> 1934.63
show I've played it very safe I'm not

1929.38 --> 1938.169
gonna play any video of anyone except

1934.63 --> 1941.0490000000002
people that I trust enough to not

1938.169 --> 1944.23
secretly gonna screw me over and I asked

1941.049 --> 1945.789
them and like hey can I put that on and

1944.23 --> 1948.22
do you have any conditions like with

1945.789 --> 1950.02
Nathan I've mirrored some of his things

1948.22 --> 1952.21
he would always say okay just wait two

1950.02 --> 1956.08
days or something so he got his

1952.21 --> 1959.89
monetization in and then I do it and was

1956.08 --> 1960.4289999999999
before I got myself monetized and that's

1959.89 --> 1966.039
okay

1960.429 --> 1968.44
I respect that and Hosea is okay with me

1966.039 --> 1976.78
mirroring stuff as well when I'm part of

1968.44 --> 1979.059
it so yeah I'm not just gonna like oh

1976.78 --> 1982.72
look he did something crazy look at this

1979.059 --> 1986.2
piece of video that he made no I'll talk

1982.72 --> 1988.63
about it I'll reference it but I'm not

1986.2 --> 1991.51
gonna put it into my own video material

1988.63 --> 1994.65
basically that just I'm just playing it

1991.51 --> 1994.65
safe I guess that

2039.72 --> 2046.559
oh yeah by the way I I tried my phone in

2044.95 --> 2054.27
the yeah I talked about it a little bit

2046.559 --> 2057.97
I tried it out I even found a loader

2054.27 --> 2060.55
yeah to chart a charger but it's

2057.97 --> 2064.8889999999997
absolutely that's like the charger won't

2060.55 --> 2068.07
even register it's like non-functional

2064.889 --> 2070.69
so it's not the battery it's just dead I

2068.07 --> 2073.0
don't know what happened it's it's

2070.69 --> 2078.94
pretty old it wasn't dad the last time I

2073.0 --> 2083.399
checked it out I know well or maybe yeah

2078.94 --> 2083.399
I'm gonna try something else later but

2088.06 --> 2094.899
[Music]

2102.18 --> 2112.98
[Music]

2113.52 --> 2123.13
yeah all right how do I song loud and

2119.83 --> 2126.1
clear what you meant louder than doing

2123.13 --> 2131.59
my Geiger - well it's fine don't worry

2126.1 --> 2137.2599999999998
about it yeah so how you doing yeah bit

2131.59 --> 2140.859
of a cold kind of situation I'm sorry no

2137.26 --> 2143.0800000000004
was it was very much dude time because I

2140.859 --> 2144.609
haven't been sick in a long long time

2143.08 --> 2146.77
and it's kind of like part of the

2144.609 --> 2148.42
metabolic all processes and if you don't

2146.77 --> 2151.45
get it too long then there's just

2148.42 --> 2152.83
certain things like even though you stay

2151.45 --> 2155.109
very clean there's just certain things

2152.83 --> 2157.3199999999997
that can't be cleaned up without that

2155.109 --> 2159.9
metabolic overhaul and that's why it's

2157.32 --> 2164.9100000000003
yeah you kind of have to go

2159.9 --> 2166.319
every now and then very good yeah it's

2164.91 --> 2168.569
weird I don't know one of the word

2166.319 --> 2171.99
metabolic like there's something to my

2168.569 --> 2175.829
wearing well in metabolic it's just the

2171.99 --> 2183.049
metabolism the inner chemistry like the

2175.829 --> 2186.059
lymph nodes what they do and how your

2183.049 --> 2188.46
nutrient exchange on a cellular level

2186.059 --> 2193.23
all that there's a very complex process

2188.46 --> 2196.5
with hormonal settings basically various

2193.23 --> 2198.599
things and certain settings need to be

2196.5 --> 2203.13
touched upon which is like the clean up

2198.599 --> 2205.829
state in order to yeah clean up issues

2203.13 --> 2211.17
and that's right part of the getting a

2205.829 --> 2214.65
cold thing work mmm-hmm

2211.17 --> 2216.1800000000003
it's weird yeah there's like that's why

2214.65 --> 2218.099
I think it's not it's not really a

2216.18 --> 2219.799
disease it's not a virus or anything it

2218.099 --> 2223.1400000000003
don't believe it at all

2219.799 --> 2226.2889999999998
it's triggered automatically by seeing

2223.14 --> 2228.15
it seeing people sneeze or hearing it

2226.289 --> 2230.73
that's why I try to always mute when I'm

2228.15 --> 2235.289
sneezing because I don't want to other

2230.73 --> 2241.47
people to catch it yeah because you can

2235.289 --> 2243.2400000000002
catch it by seeing it's like so it's

2241.47 --> 2245.0989999999997
like the state like someone else needs

2243.24 --> 2247.5
and then cuz I was really like everybody

2245.099 --> 2249.809
in my house the other day was sick

2247.5 --> 2251.76
and I kept saying I can't get sick I

2249.809 --> 2253.38
can't get sick but I literally can't let

2251.76 --> 2255.2700000000004
I was paranoid about getting sick

2253.38 --> 2257.279
because I I do a lot of stuff like a

2255.27 --> 2260.339
rapid like me getting sick it's really

2257.279 --> 2262.71
not good for me like I still push myself

2260.339 --> 2264.48
through it but I don't like being

2262.71 --> 2267.119
stickers I can't function the way that I

2264.48 --> 2268.829
normally can like I can't yeah you know

2267.119 --> 2270.029
like this there's a lot of stuff out to

2268.829 --> 2271.5890000000004
do and everything I don't like being

2270.029 --> 2273.599
sick because I can't get it done that's

2271.589 --> 2274.92
all it's very frustrating so I kept

2273.599 --> 2276.299
telling us if I can't get you think that

2274.92 --> 2278.549
it was still in the back of my head like

2276.299 --> 2281.25
I might get sick cause everybody else is

2278.549 --> 2282.779
sick and they really looked fake so it

2281.25 --> 2286.319
is psychosomatic I do agree with that

2282.779 --> 2289.099
like and then and also like your body's

2286.319 --> 2292.23
you but like really your body is predict

2289.099 --> 2293.81
protecting itself from other from other

2292.23 --> 2296.12
more damaging things to answer

2293.81 --> 2297.65
when that cooling process happened right

2296.12 --> 2300.0099999999998
looks like we have told you I know the

2297.65 --> 2309.86
karaoke leg we're being exposed to

2300.01 --> 2311.3900000000003
through the food writer and our work and

2309.86 --> 2313.19
the more polluting sorry sorry to

2311.39 --> 2315.5
interrupt for a moment but the more

2313.19 --> 2318.62
polluting a job for example is like you

2315.5 --> 2321.2
really get exposed to [ __ ] if you have

2318.62 --> 2323.21
any kind of job you will get sick a lot

2321.2 --> 2326.0899999999997
a lot of people that do that get sick a

2323.21 --> 2328.28
lot unless they're like really well

2326.09 --> 2330.2200000000003
defended and like very careful with

2328.28 --> 2334.61
everything

2330.22 --> 2336.7599999999998
no but just happens if you if you

2334.61 --> 2338.9300000000003
pollute yourself you will get more sick

2336.76 --> 2342.6200000000003
you will get sick a longer and more

2338.93 --> 2344.5099999999998
often that's true

2342.62 --> 2347.18
you can't like your body like basically

2344.51 --> 2349.07
what your body has to do is built up the

2347.18 --> 2351.47
immunity if you've never been exposed to

2349.07 --> 2353.09
anything your body won't know what to

2351.47 --> 2355.6099999999997
expect what your body doesn't have a

2353.09 --> 2357.2000000000003
defense mechanism in order to protect

2355.61 --> 2360.2000000000003
this up from those things so getting

2357.2 --> 2362.66
sick is actually like it's very very

2360.2 --> 2364.04
positive thing that your body does it

2362.66 --> 2368.0
like that I don't know if you've heard

2364.04 --> 2370.4
this movie called oh I got it every it's

2368.0 --> 2373.25
either everything everything it was um

2370.4 --> 2374.36
it's like a cute look you probably ain't

2373.25 --> 2377.69
probably heard of what you never watch

2374.36 --> 2379.55
it's kind of like a romantic it's like

2377.69 --> 2381.9700000000003
not a chick flick hot chick flick but

2379.55 --> 2385.04
it's like one of those romantic novel of

2381.97 --> 2387.7999999999997
movies and it was about this girl who

2385.04 --> 2388.85
her mother lied to her I hate that I

2387.8 --> 2392.1800000000003
might be exploiting this for other

2388.85 --> 2395.06
people but um like basically her mother

2392.18 --> 2397.5499999999997
told her that she had this at this very

2395.06 --> 2398.89
very terminal disease so that if she

2397.55 --> 2401.03
goes outside

2398.89 --> 2402.89
you know like she'll be exposed and

2401.03 --> 2405.86
she'll die basically like you know that

2402.89 --> 2408.56
you know because of that she has to stay

2405.86 --> 2412.55
in the house and for all of her life up

2408.56 --> 2413.84
to like 18 I believe a kenobi she stayed

2412.55 --> 2417.1400000000003
in the house she never ever left the

2413.84 --> 2419.6000000000004
house ever like and then um this boy

2417.14 --> 2421.52
comes along and he's working along but

2419.6 --> 2423.19
she really likes she sees him from you

2421.52 --> 2425.36
know across the street or whatever and

2423.19 --> 2427.89
basically like she starts liking him she

2425.36 --> 2431.46
wants to go outside no bowl of law

2427.89 --> 2432.81
and but then she find it like she just

2431.46 --> 2436.41
can't take if she sneaks out the house

2432.81 --> 2438.63
runs off with him and they they have sex

2436.41 --> 2440.67
or when they have her like when they

2438.63 --> 2443.55
when they have sex she starts to get

2440.67 --> 2444.87
sick like oh my god what's happening to

2443.55 --> 2447.0600000000004
me like she's never seen never

2444.87 --> 2449.88
experienced it before I don't think so

2447.06 --> 2451.2
wish you wanted a doctor oh and they

2449.88 --> 2452.79
like you know like they recovered like

2451.2 --> 2455.73
they said you have a very very low

2452.79 --> 2457.23
immune system like you're like you it's

2455.73 --> 2459.63
like you've never been at like basically

2457.23 --> 2462.21
your immune system has never been tested

2459.63 --> 2464.04
you've never been exposed yes that

2462.21 --> 2465.42
that's the reason why little kids

2464.04 --> 2467.49
especially when they're still crawling

2465.42 --> 2470.31
around should basically have the

2467.49 --> 2473.2799999999997
opportunity to have unpause and very

2470.31 --> 2475.49
important soil the stuff in their mouth

2473.28 --> 2478.32
and and that's what they naturally do

2475.49 --> 2482.0899999999997
because you get a lot of immunity and of

2478.32 --> 2482.09
course breast milk it's very important

2483.08 --> 2493.47
the exposure special answer but yeah a

2491.37 --> 2496.08
lot of like a lot of sounds like parents

2493.47 --> 2498.0299999999997
like they they're very very protective

2496.08 --> 2500.04
like can be overly protective of their

2498.03 --> 2502.53
children that's the point where like

2500.04 --> 2505.2
sometimes we forget that yeah in order

2502.53 --> 2507.8100000000004
to be equipped for life you have to go

2505.2 --> 2510.33
through certain those are certain things

2507.81 --> 2513.18
and that's just not just that's not just

2510.33 --> 2516.0299999999997
like experienced wise or you know mental

2513.18 --> 2518.1299999999997
that's biological as well but if you've

2516.03 --> 2519.5400000000004
never liked that that's a part of the

2518.13 --> 2523.32
whole thing it's a lot of thought

2519.54 --> 2524.85
process so like oh yeah Brenda said I'll

2523.32 --> 2526.1400000000003
bet to say that like this is like it's

2524.85 --> 2527.79
funny that you brought it up that that

2526.14 --> 2529.23
movie that's literally and that's how

2527.79 --> 2531.39
she found out that she didn't have that

2529.23 --> 2533.07
terminal disease my mom just made it up

2531.39 --> 2535.29
but she was afraid of what what happened

2533.07 --> 2537.54
to her daughter basically like her her

2535.29 --> 2540.0299999999997
husband had gotten killed she was afraid

2537.54 --> 2541.2599999999998
and I think her brother died too she was

2540.03 --> 2543.69
afraid to lose her daughter so that's

2541.26 --> 2547.1400000000003
what she meant get that disease but

2543.69 --> 2549.51
lately but you know resulting in her

2547.14 --> 2552.18
having a very weak immune system and

2549.51 --> 2554.4300000000003
also just heard not be but you know you

2552.18 --> 2556.1699999999996
can't can't put someone in a box you

2554.43 --> 2559.2599999999998
can't do that even if you're afraid you

2556.17 --> 2561.57
can't do that to anyone you'd be robbing

2559.26 --> 2562.7400000000002
them of that of life

2561.57 --> 2567.51
so that will you know that was holding

2562.74 --> 2571.29
below yeah ramble I don't know now you

2567.51 --> 2574.0200000000004
basically kind of dragged a complicated

2571.29 --> 2577.83
set up in there the entire Syrian that I

2574.02 --> 2580.25
couldn't follow that but but I get the

2577.83 --> 2582.7799999999997
ology like yeah if you're not exposed to

2580.25 --> 2584.67
if you're being if your parents were

2582.78 --> 2588.6000000000004
overprotective and you've never been

2584.67 --> 2593.67
exposed to anything dirty or out in

2588.6 --> 2597.27
nature then yeah you will be fun your

2593.67 --> 2599.2200000000003
immune system your response will be very

2597.27 --> 2602.37
aggressive at least at first

2599.22 --> 2604.47
you can still kind of recover but it'll

2602.37 --> 2605.88
never be as strong as when you're when

2604.47 --> 2609.81
you were exposed

2605.88 --> 2612.0
that's very little kid the dirt and

2609.81 --> 2614.52
stuff so nice it isn't poison because

2612.0 --> 2616.68
when you exposed to poison pesticide for

2614.52 --> 2621.48
self is the exact opposite effect the no

2616.68 --> 2623.1299999999997
actually cost cascade effects over the

2621.48 --> 2625.77
rest of your lifetime by giving you a

2623.13 --> 2629.04
metabolic problems or the heavy allergy

2625.77 --> 2631.44
hardship so be very careful it's not

2629.04 --> 2634.95
it's about exposure to the organic

2631.44 --> 2638.9
material and dirt everywhere is so much

2634.95 --> 2656.49
endurance incredible if it's not but

2638.9 --> 2658.8
that's it and and the thing is is that

2656.49 --> 2664.2
the original concept of vaccines is

2658.8 --> 2667.17
basically based off this concept yes yes

2664.2 --> 2671.6699999999996
but then they basically all isolate

2667.17 --> 2675.39
bacteria and and it put extra poison

2671.67 --> 2678.41
[ __ ] with that and then they amp up the

2675.39 --> 2682.7599999999998
amount thereby increasing the poison and

2678.41 --> 2685.1099999999997
yeah it's a lead an old an old folklore

2682.76 --> 2687.0600000000004
basically that people could naturally do

2685.11 --> 2689.34
themselves was then weaponized to

2687.06 --> 2692.2799999999997
basically destroy people's immune system

2689.34 --> 2693.48
by replacing it with poison exactly what

2692.28 --> 2697.2000000000003
I warned about during

2693.48 --> 2700.01
a little thing that's what antibiotics

2697.2 --> 2705.5099999999998
can be extremely dangerous as well

2700.01 --> 2707.67
well extremely dangerous good that like

2705.51 --> 2709.8
it's to a certain extent because you can

2707.67 --> 2712.5
be destroying the bacteria that's

2709.8 --> 2715.1400000000003
actually required for you to heal right

2712.5 --> 2718.17
yeah your intestinal flora that gets

2715.14 --> 2721.6189999999997
damaged often that's very true that's

2718.17 --> 2723.9900000000002
why I wouldn't take that like maybe in

2721.619 --> 2726.15
the 80s I would have because it was

2723.99 --> 2728.7299999999996
almost very guaranteed to work what

2726.15 --> 2734.13
they've overused it so much that a lot

2728.73 --> 2737.76
of yeah bacterial infections or

2734.13 --> 2739.71
parasites what however that works it it

2737.76 --> 2742.53
doesn't help against that anymore take

2739.71 --> 2746.33
more open infection dangerous type of

2742.53 --> 2748.8
things doesn't work against it anymore

2746.33 --> 2751.91
with a lot of us you know I'd rather

2748.8 --> 2757.23
just use silver and certain herbs to

2751.91 --> 2760.3799999999997
approach it not as universal as the

2757.23 --> 2762.9900000000002
antibiotics concept was just everyone

2760.38 --> 2765.0
thing that was how they approaches the

2762.99 --> 2767.85
get that market basically it's just a

2765.0 --> 2771.54
huge market but when you approach it

2767.85 --> 2775.3689999999997
more personal with herbs and colloidal

2771.54 --> 2775.369
silver yeah you don't have that market

2775.46 --> 2784.56
you're making it there's a lot of noise

2777.66 --> 2786.5699999999997
happening there Jesse mmm but yeah we

2784.56 --> 2792.5099999999998
can still do it ourselves by becoming

2786.57 --> 2794.8500000000004
our own doctor and taking the is it the

2792.51 --> 2797.0400000000004
monopoly of that knowledge out of the

2794.85 --> 2801.0
hands of the medical industrial complex

2797.04 --> 2804.05
and making it our own and as long as

2801.0 --> 2809.34
there's some level of free trade and

2804.05 --> 2811.3500000000004
industrial yeah extraction of plant

2809.34 --> 2813.9900000000002
substances there's like that they do it

2811.35 --> 2819.02
very carefully and and not just the

2813.99 --> 2821.85
poisonous then yeah we we can do that

2819.02 --> 2823.68
but as long as long as there is some

2821.85 --> 2825.99
kind of a free market as long as not

2823.68 --> 2827.1189999999997
everything's like okay this can't be

2825.99 --> 2829.4889999999996
sold that can be

2827.119 --> 2832.7290000000003
that can't be solved basically nothing

2829.489 --> 2834.89
can be solved unless the Empire does it

2832.729 --> 2838.5789999999997
they can of course do everything they

2834.89 --> 2840.859
want so if we end up like that we're

2838.579 --> 2843.1400000000003
still gonna be screwed it's just like

2840.859 --> 2846.739
yeah yeah you can't get anything you can

2843.14 --> 2850.1299999999997
just wrap it you're deaf basically by

2846.739 --> 2852.41
doing it the medical way because you

2850.13 --> 2853.2490000000003
have no other option that's kind of part

2852.41 --> 2856.0989999999997
of the plan

2853.249 --> 2858.769
oh by the way thank you only Shippo can

2856.099 --> 2861.589
see for the 10 New Zealand dollar super

2858.769 --> 2870.859
jet donation yeah 20 hundreds show well

2861.589 --> 2874.3089999999997
done thanks thanks a lot man I lost

2870.859 --> 2876.979
track well no you were just saying that

2874.309 --> 2880.7000000000003
they liked the part The Powers That Be

2876.979 --> 2883.5389999999998
have a lot of control over like the way

2880.7 --> 2889.3689999999997
you know that I'm regarding the whole

2883.539 --> 2891.559
running the whole thing and this yeah

2889.369 --> 2896.4100000000003
it's a lot of Airy it can be very very

2891.559 --> 2898.7000000000003
draining too to think about like I so

2896.41 --> 2900.6499999999996
would like that's why you have to you

2898.7 --> 2902.1189999999997
can remove like you can remove yourself

2900.65 --> 2902.6600000000003
it like you don't have to be subjected

2902.119 --> 2904.9990000000003
to it

2902.66 --> 2909.3089999999997
right there there are some cases where

2904.999 --> 2912.109
you will or you can be psychologically

2909.309 --> 2914.239
manipulated into subjecting yourself

2912.109 --> 2916.43
into that but you you don't have to it's

2914.239 --> 2918.41
always a choice and once they get you

2916.43 --> 2920.66
into that if I all we've got you and now

2918.41 --> 2927.3799999999997
you they're gonna drag more if you into

2920.66 --> 2929.2
it until there's nothing left right no

2927.38 --> 2932.089
not to say that there aren't like home

2929.2 --> 2933.6499999999996
but there there's so many there's so

2932.089 --> 2937.099
many other methods like they're not to

2933.65 --> 2939.14
say that there aren't on so domes that

2937.099 --> 2941.329
are part of the medical industry that

2939.14 --> 2944.089
there's like that that don't help people

2941.329 --> 2947.3900000000003
or anything like that but it's it's the

2944.089 --> 2950.719
core the core of it is not necessarily

2947.39 --> 2952.339
wanting you to be like like it's just

2950.719 --> 2953.989
it's shown it's been revealed that

2952.339 --> 2956.779
they're not really concerned with like

2953.989 --> 2958.609
trying to make sure everyone is actually

2956.779 --> 2961.1
cured from whatever it is that they have

2958.609 --> 2962.99
they they want to they want

2961.1 --> 2964.99
to be a patient like constantly

2962.99 --> 2968.0299999999997
constantly having to go back to them

2964.99 --> 2971.6899999999996
well it's among the problem is it's

2968.03 --> 2974.6600000000003
among there and it's very good hard to

2971.69 --> 2977.69
get away because the real word it's all

2974.66 --> 2980.33
very specific method based it's

2977.69 --> 2984.05
allopathic it's all very specific method

2980.33 --> 2986.63
based it's not holistic making it

2984.05 --> 2990.13
personal to basically focus on the

2986.63 --> 2992.3
personal healing of the patient rather

2990.13 --> 2996.4700000000003
categorizing and symptomatically and

2992.3 --> 3000.8500000000004
that system can be used kind of good or

2996.47 --> 3003.25
it can be just terribly abused by

3000.85 --> 3010.69
basically not really caring about it and

3003.25 --> 3013.0
just like I don't know yeah doing

3010.69 --> 3014.9500000000003
superfluous things or things that seem

3013.0 --> 3016.87
very unlikely but it falls within the

3014.95 --> 3018.6699999999996
method and then you do that because all

3016.87 --> 3022.5699999999997
other options are completely ignored

3018.67 --> 3025.27
that kind of thing and that can be like

3022.57 --> 3026.92
a pure conviction by a doctor that they

3025.27 --> 3029.11
really don't believe the other things

3026.92 --> 3032.41
are there because they were heavily

3029.11 --> 3034.9300000000003
indoctrinated or just coerced into not

3032.41 --> 3037.5699999999997
believing that so it doesn't necessarily

3034.93 --> 3041.5
have to be evil but there can be

3037.57 --> 3043.54
definitely evil dicks among them that

3041.5 --> 3045.85
know this and they're just like hahaha

3043.54 --> 3049.89
yeah they don't know what they're just

3045.85 --> 3057.0699999999997
all they're all just puppets

3049.89 --> 3060.0099999999998
exactly they are definitely yeah but

3057.07 --> 3061.8700000000003
data like their you know they a lot of

3060.01 --> 3063.4300000000003
times were doesn't actually we just you

3061.87 --> 3065.0499999999997
know we just naturally trust what we're

3063.43 --> 3066.4199999999996
told what when someone tells us

3065.05 --> 3068.4700000000003
something it's like oh well that must be

3066.42 --> 3070.81
you know must be true and this is my

3068.47 --> 3073.12
superior force so it especially viewing

3070.81 --> 3075.16
a if a superior is telling you something

3073.12 --> 3077.5899999999997
you're going to trust with the superior

3075.16 --> 3081.0099999999998
throwing angle but like they like

3077.59 --> 3083.6200000000003
without real mental award the magazine's

3081.01 --> 3087.3700000000003
the opinion makers within the doctor

3083.62 --> 3092.02
world and the snitches my god the

3087.37 --> 3094.67
snitches everywhere this seriously

3092.02 --> 3098.5099999999998
like a doctor can rarely work on their

3094.67 --> 3101.12
own so you have to have personnel but

3098.51 --> 3107.21
yeah they want to make a quick buck

3101.12 --> 3110.81
sometimes too you know it's it's a tough

3107.21 --> 3113.9
world I had some look into it

3110.81 --> 3117.5499999999997
fiafia just of how that works the social

3113.9 --> 3120.9500000000003
of socializing and how things go around

3117.55 --> 3125.27
mm-hmm not that I was a doctor right

3120.95 --> 3130.48
okay not claiming that but in a way my

3125.27 --> 3135.89
ex kind of was pretty serious dentist

3130.48 --> 3143.45
then could do surgical stuff so right

3135.89 --> 3145.4
I seen her so she gave lectures about

3143.45 --> 3149.3199999999997
alternate alternative treatments that's

3145.4 --> 3154.4
credible like she actually did that

3149.32 --> 3158.09
right like yeah I was so proud of that

3154.4 --> 3160.4
[ __ ] like wow she did it of course she

3158.09 --> 3162.32
did all of it but I was kind of the one

3160.4 --> 3164.27
that gave her the idea is she had no

3162.32 --> 3166.7000000000003
idea about any of the alternative world

3164.27 --> 3170.24
before that and I was deeply into that

3166.7 --> 3171.83
was drowning it at natural news most of

3170.24 --> 3174.2599999999998
it that's where a lot of it came from

3171.83 --> 3176.24
and it was just a wide world like wow

3174.26 --> 3181.4
there's just so much more than the

3176.24 --> 3183.95
freaking doctor yeah exactly

3181.4 --> 3187.1
good like it's you know you have to

3183.95 --> 3190.2799999999997
educate yourself and you have to be you

3187.1 --> 3191.63
have to be willing team like you have

3190.28 --> 3193.42
like the other the other hand to meet

3191.63 --> 3196.13
yourself you have to be willing to

3193.42 --> 3199.07
explore that there's other options don't

3196.13 --> 3201.29
ever like we have an entire world that's

3199.07 --> 3203.75
open if I tweet this the world is way

3201.29 --> 3206.57
too big for there to be only one

3203.75 --> 3209.6
specific way of doing something like

3206.57 --> 3211.8700000000003
it's just play or one specific home just

3209.6 --> 3215.81
like well you know what I mean it's just

3211.87 --> 3221.72
yeah I want to give a very concise

3215.81 --> 3224.12
example of this so if if you're a

3221.72 --> 3225.48
typical person right you have whatever

3224.12 --> 3227.52
level trust in the

3225.48 --> 3229.2
doctor for whatever reason reason could

3227.52 --> 3230.1
be personal that you just don't like

3229.2 --> 3233.0699999999997
that stuff

3230.1 --> 3237.33
or that you follow alternative whatever

3233.07 --> 3242.67
but if you're gonna go to a a doctor or

3237.33 --> 3246.69
basically any person and then like take

3242.67 --> 3250.26
their stuff and just trust them without

3246.69 --> 3252.9
knowing what it is that you take just by

3250.26 --> 3255.17
trusting them then you're trusting that

3252.9 --> 3257.88
those that person has a full scope

3255.17 --> 3260.2200000000003
inside of how all the consequences of

3257.88 --> 3262.85
everything and is responsible about it

3260.22 --> 3265.9199999999996
and if you're gonna do that then you

3262.85 --> 3269.4
take incredible risk of cascading

3265.92 --> 3271.05
situations that's why I like and my

3269.4 --> 3273.63
mother even kind of was like this as

3271.05 --> 3275.82
well like she knew she was it like in

3273.63 --> 3278.4
the hospital during cancer and stuff and

3275.82 --> 3280.6400000000003
there were a nurse would come up and

3278.4 --> 3283.6800000000003
like said okay I'm gonna add this stuff

3280.64 --> 3285.359
and she was very well aware bits

3283.68 --> 3287.22
basically of the chemistry because she

3285.359 --> 3288.2999999999997
knew she was combining medicines and she

3287.22 --> 3290.7599999999998
just learned about it

3288.3 --> 3293.1600000000003
she was like what are you doing if you

3290.76 --> 3295.53
would hook that on I will get an instant

3293.16 --> 3299.46
allergic reaction and die on the spot

3295.53 --> 3301.3500000000004
are you crazy when she prevented her own

3299.46 --> 3302.7
death even though she was like kind of

3301.35 --> 3303.42
Woo's doubt and everything it's like

3302.7 --> 3307.109
incredible

3303.42 --> 3310.71
she had that thing the problem was she

3307.109 --> 3313.23
was already in and all the farmer [ __ ]

3310.71 --> 3313.89
and once you get so you get combined

3313.23 --> 3317.4900000000002
[ __ ]

3313.89 --> 3321.48
you can't get out of it it's just it's

3317.49 --> 3323.97
impossible yeah so that's yeah you have

3321.48 --> 3327.39
to start early become your own doctor

3323.97 --> 3330.75
figure out how your body works what is

3327.39 --> 3333.15
real what is not learn from your own pay

3330.75 --> 3334.8
attention to the cycles of your own body

3333.15 --> 3338.7000000000003
and this and the signs and everything

3334.8 --> 3342.119
take it very seriously and don't get

3338.7 --> 3344.49
panic now don't get panicked out by what

3342.119 --> 3348.03
other people say necessarily trust your

3344.49 --> 3350.7599999999998
body to trust that there is a system

3348.03 --> 3352.8900000000003
going on that like an experience that I

3350.76 --> 3354.84
often have is that when I get sick

3352.89 --> 3356.7599999999998
especially when I get really sick like

3354.84 --> 3358.289
this heavy fever and headache sense it

3356.76 --> 3361.5890000000004
is horrifying

3358.289 --> 3363.809
but after that I get like after that's

3361.589 --> 3366.479
all over and I get like these heavy rest

3363.809 --> 3368.699
periods and sweating maybe and then at

3366.479 --> 3372.779
certain point it goes away and it's like

3368.699 --> 3377.789
oh my god it's like everything is opened

3372.779 --> 3380.569
up and is more clear I'm less distracted

3377.789 --> 3383.7290000000003
I guess less nervous about things like

3380.569 --> 3386.249
at less pissed off I'm more patient that

3383.729 --> 3388.2889999999998
is also what I get out of after being

3386.249 --> 3390.359
sick every time and that's something

3388.289 --> 3395.3390000000004
that most people forget that they just

3390.359 --> 3397.919
remember the shitty part so it is him

3395.339 --> 3400.41
thoroughly convinced that the especially

3397.919 --> 3404.069
typical colds that everybody constantly

3400.41 --> 3407.939
gets is a metabolic clean up system

3404.069 --> 3410.39
inherent to the living being I think

3407.939 --> 3413.0389999999998
that other creatures also get it in

3410.39 --> 3424.739
their own way they just hide it because

3413.039 --> 3427.1090000000004
it shows weakness is impressing on a

3424.739 --> 3429.059
sizing parts for example like for

3427.109 --> 3431.219
example we get cats get sneezed it's

3429.059 --> 3437.219
very dangerous for them it gets serious

3431.219 --> 3440.159
trauma from it sort of cats get well

3437.219 --> 3442.919
some cats can get sneezing fits for

3440.159 --> 3445.109
reasons and when I can stop it's

3442.919 --> 3448.589
extremely dangerous for a cat if they

3445.109 --> 3452.339
keep stuck in it because the pressure

3448.589 --> 3453.959
constantly is too much they can't deal

3452.339 --> 3460.589
with sneezing as well as bigger

3453.959 --> 3464.0989999999997
creatures wait that makes sense saying

3460.589 --> 3466.199
we're all kind of like vo live with a

3464.099 --> 3468.809
you know but I guess is similar to

3466.199 --> 3471.089
babies who get that whooping cough like

3468.809 --> 3473.5190000000002
whole sorry you've been call from

3471.089 --> 3476.489
syndromes like they can't handle

3473.519 --> 3478.769
constantly coughing and wheezing like

3476.489 --> 3481.469
that like whenever when a baby gets it

3478.769 --> 3483.269
lays like it's a strain of it the strain

3481.469 --> 3484.2490000000003
on the system and while it's trying to

3483.269 --> 3488.5389999999998
steadily grow

3484.249 --> 3488.5389999999998
that's very up yet it's not good

3491.289 --> 3497.38
well what are you like how have you

3495.38 --> 3499.13
researched like have you gone into um

3497.38 --> 3504.069
dementia like what are your views on

3499.13 --> 3504.069
that dementia yes

3504.099 --> 3513.1400000000003
you know like elderly or park no wait no

3508.97 --> 3515.359
Parkinson's but nerve degenerate things

3513.14 --> 3517.16
you mean like what elderly people

3515.359 --> 3517.9
typically get or what's the other one

3517.16 --> 3524.989
called

3517.9 --> 3527.329
not dementia first more dementia like on

3524.989 --> 3530.39
it can develop it your different types

3527.329 --> 3532.549
of dementia there so there's the there's

3530.39 --> 3535.759
the bottle with dementia where the like

3532.549 --> 3537.2889999999998
the of the functions like Oh what is it

3535.759 --> 3540.109
new product in which I believe in there

3537.289 --> 3542.509
there's also on vascular dementia which

3540.109 --> 3544.519
you developed from having though was you

3542.509 --> 3547.809
development having like oh I'm not

3544.519 --> 3550.3689999999997
stroke or something like that which is

3547.809 --> 3552.289
which is what owned my grandfather is

3550.369 --> 3556.1600000000003
going and it affects the blood vessels

3552.289 --> 3558.2000000000003
the blood um know the functions of the

3556.16 --> 3559.069
brain okay so we like this bleeding is

3558.2 --> 3561.049
bleeding on the brain

3559.069 --> 3563.779
bring the stroke and it affects the

3561.049 --> 3565.609
cognitive skills so like that's the one

3563.779 --> 3569.42
that that's the one that he has yeah

3565.609 --> 3574.16
it's a very tough situation there's some

3569.42 --> 3575.9500000000003
things you can do but it may only pop I

3574.16 --> 3578.509
have basically postpone the inevitable

3575.95 --> 3581.8999999999996
because he's already old and when that

3578.509 --> 3585.0190000000002
yeah it all heals much its unless he

3581.9 --> 3587.029
like has some really big thing that's

3585.019 --> 3590.45
like still needing to manifest by a

3587.029 --> 3594.019
spirit it's usually a sign it's you know

3590.45 --> 3596.1189999999997
now yeah sorry sorry to be so like that

3594.019 --> 3598.5789999999997
but there are some things you can do

3596.119 --> 3602.17
every time the brain is involved things

3598.579 --> 3605.239
like fish oil for example can help and

3602.17 --> 3607.489
you just need to give them the substance

3605.239 --> 3610.7
that the damaged thing is basically

3607.489 --> 3613.579
consisted of and fish all really tends

3610.7 --> 3615.9199999999996
to help out with that it's known to help

3613.579 --> 3618.799
with dementia even especially in the

3615.92 --> 3621.619
preliminary stages it can even like stop

3618.799 --> 3623.079
it potentially but you have to be very

3621.619 --> 3628.299
quick

3623.079 --> 3631.84
the note is it right it can still help

3628.299 --> 3633.809
basically lessen the burden at least

3631.84 --> 3636.369
[Music]

3633.809 --> 3639.4300000000003
you'll be able is roughly and because

3636.369 --> 3640.989
they're so yeah like there's that you

3639.43 --> 3646.749
know there's seven stages happen like

3640.989 --> 3649.719
he's he's caught in between she's really

3646.749 --> 3650.999
just really rough because like he has up

3649.719 --> 3662.17
I'm so sorry

3650.999 --> 3665.6189999999997
airplane of you know but he like he has

3662.17 --> 3667.9300000000003
trouble remembering out but it started

3665.619 --> 3669.67
off like graduate like when we a lot of

3667.93 --> 3672.459
times you don't notice the first three

3669.67 --> 3674.17
stages when they happen like it comes

3672.459 --> 3676.69
off as like especially when the person

3674.17 --> 3678.279
is older it comes off as like minimal

3676.69 --> 3681.13
things like sometimes they may forget

3678.279 --> 3683.019
where they put their pencil they may

3681.13 --> 3686.7090000000003
forget what they had for breakfast like

3683.019 --> 3688.6299999999997
stuff like that you know something like

3686.709 --> 3690.64
certain things they might just need help

3688.63 --> 3692.619
remembering like and then but then they

3690.64 --> 3695.5589999999997
got to the point where he put on number

3692.619 --> 3697.509
the day and I had to keep reminding him

3695.559 --> 3698.799
even though he had a calendar it got to

3697.509 --> 3700.209
that point and then eventually that's

3698.799 --> 3703.089
the one when he didn't like it I was

3700.209 --> 3705.3689999999997
what he was unless they stayed really

3703.089 --> 3708.729
set now and also not just that but also

3705.369 --> 3710.7690000000002
distortions of reality as well I can't

3708.729 --> 3712.18
watch something and he'll think that

3710.769 --> 3718.68
that's actually happened

3712.18 --> 3721.239
ouch yeah that's very very tough well I

3718.68 --> 3723.339
to be fair I don't know no anything that

3721.239 --> 3725.7690000000002
can basically help people beyond that

3723.339 --> 3728.68
stage but you can basically start the

3725.769 --> 3733.269
symptoms a little for example fish oil

3728.68 --> 3735.729
and yeah I don't know there's another

3733.269 --> 3737.979
thing you can do also I've heard this is

3735.729 --> 3739.6299999999997
just a rumor basically through info

3737.979 --> 3740.499
worse but things like brain force

3739.63 --> 3744.19
nootropics

3740.499 --> 3746.8289999999997
can basically give moments where he can

3744.19 --> 3748.779
get things together at least for a

3746.829 --> 3751.449
couple of hours that's something you

3748.779 --> 3753.789
could try it's not gonna fix it but it

3751.449 --> 3756.58
will definitely restore him it might

3753.789 --> 3758.4100000000003
restore him more to his old self

3756.58 --> 3762.79
being able to focus better for a period

3758.41 --> 3764.77
of time well you have no guarantees I

3762.79 --> 3766.86
just heard a couple of stories here and

3764.77 --> 3769.18
there about that people's grandpas and

3766.86 --> 3774.79
grandmothers using that stuff while they

3769.18 --> 3776.68
were demanded so yeah that makes it like

3774.79 --> 3777.67
that make sense I'm like I might look

3776.68 --> 3781.2999999999997
into that because he does have his

3777.67 --> 3784.06
moments where is totally clear and

3781.3 --> 3785.77
totally lights it's ridiculous it'll be

3784.06 --> 3788.2599999999998
like days where he's just like this

3785.77 --> 3790.81
there's also he recognizes everything he

3788.26 --> 3792.34
recognized everybody and he was like

3790.81 --> 3794.62
he's so clear like you got some

3792.34 --> 3796.54
questions that were answered clearly and

3794.62 --> 3798.3399999999997
everything and then like we're in there

3796.54 --> 3801.82
oh those days we used totally out of it

3798.34 --> 3803.98
it's like he's in another world he does

3801.82 --> 3807.1000000000004
still have clear moments though right

3803.98 --> 3808.72
right that's very important I thought he

3807.1 --> 3811.6
didn't have those anymore because if you

3808.72 --> 3817.2099999999996
did if you if that's the case then fish

3811.6 --> 3819.25
oil may may do a still yeah postpone the

3817.21 --> 3826.69
bad periods for a while potentially I

3819.25 --> 3830.89
would try that maybe I don't know a

3826.69 --> 3833.65
couple of bucks no no like this this is

3830.89 --> 3836.5299999999997
the thing like oh we have one thing that

3833.65 --> 3839.14
we used to do to eat fish often ohm

3836.53 --> 3841.57
actually where does one go Don he also

3839.14 --> 3844.06
has a gout I don't know if we've heard

3841.57 --> 3847.3900000000003
of gout birth or looked into that put on

3844.06 --> 3849.37
and like and basically like the doctors

3847.39 --> 3853.42
were saying that because he has coughs

3849.37 --> 3855.2799999999997
you can't fit so fish and everything but

3853.42 --> 3857.23
what's what's weird about those that the

3855.28 --> 3858.7900000000004
doctor said you can eat chicken and I

3857.23 --> 3862.09
don't understand that because chicken

3858.79 --> 3863.92
has a higher level of fear of higher I'm

3862.09 --> 3866.02
not not uric acid but a higher level of

3863.92 --> 3868.39
purines they're fish those in certain

3866.02 --> 3870.58
types of fish a disart like mackerel you

3868.39 --> 3873.52
can't have that but salmon actually has

3870.58 --> 3876.5499999999997
less fury instance if I'm not sure where

3873.52 --> 3878.41
that variable came from like you can't

3876.55 --> 3881.29
help us at all like that's what was told

3878.41 --> 3883.7799999999997
to us yeah yeah I've heard this before I

3881.29 --> 3885.9
look and now we're gonna get some a

3883.78 --> 3888.15
place that is may sound a bit sinister

3885.9 --> 3890.549
but I'm gonna say it anyway

3888.15 --> 3892.529
and I've heard that before because I've

3890.549 --> 3895.799
advised elderly that would actually add

3892.529 --> 3898.079
old people's homes to do that and they

3895.799 --> 3903.47
were literally forbidden by their

3898.079 --> 3911.4500000000003
caretakers to get that fish oil this

3903.47 --> 3911.45
will be very very creepy feeling yeah

3914.51 --> 3924.809
I'm gonna give this thing like I'm sorry

3920.75 --> 3928.529
no just like Oh like that's yeah that's

3924.809 --> 3931.26
not if it's been shown to help with like

3928.529 --> 3932.4
improving that you're like I don't you

3931.26 --> 3933.869
know and there's a lot of elderly

3932.4 --> 3935.9700000000003
patients that are in homes that have

3933.869 --> 3937.289
dementia or have all families and

3935.97 --> 3939.93
everything like that so like the fact

3937.289 --> 3942.7200000000003
that they're like no is it make sense

3939.93 --> 3944.73
you know like that would help even like

3942.72 --> 3946.68
don't help the caretakers you know I'm

3944.73 --> 3948.51
saying because that can be very it's

3946.68 --> 3951.1189999999997
very very straining on the people who

3948.51 --> 3953.73
like have to take care of the ones that

3951.119 --> 3956.88
are having those symptoms it's very very

3953.73 --> 3959.16
draining mentally physically it's just

3956.88 --> 3963.319
you know emotionally especially if your

3959.16 --> 3966.27
that's your parent you know so it's like

3963.319 --> 3968.3089999999997
so I don't understand that isn't what

3966.27 --> 3972.18
I'm sorry I just didn't give records

3968.309 --> 3973.44
about to that that can work or they have

3972.18 --> 3976.3799999999997
some kind of weird

3973.44 --> 3978.9
Oh medical combination thingy he can't

3976.38 --> 3981.4100000000003
have those substances because they're

3978.9 --> 3984.51
trying a very weird standard approach to

3981.41 --> 3994.92
the situation that literally doesn't

3984.51 --> 4003.559
help it really I don't know like I'm

3994.92 --> 4005.569
sorry yeah just take care of your own

4003.559 --> 4010.279
take care of your own an elderly if you

4005.569 --> 4012.77
can be there quickly make sure that you

4010.279 --> 4016.569
become their doctor and they don't just

4012.77 --> 4020.18
surrender that thing to some doctor guy

4016.569 --> 4020.9
that you don't know if he really likes

4020.18 --> 4023.39
him

4020.9 --> 4027.32
them even or you know doctor can be very

4023.39 --> 4030.23
smiley face but that could just be an

4027.32 --> 4035.1800000000003
image just a standard way to deal with

4030.23 --> 4038.96
patients you don't know you have to take

4035.18 --> 4041.66
care of your elderly and their they're

4038.96 --> 4043.52
grown up in the situation a generation

4041.66 --> 4045.83
where doctors were still somewhat

4043.52 --> 4047.87
ethical at least so they've been

4045.83 --> 4050.33
conditioned to always trust the doctor

4047.87 --> 4052.58
and you got to save them from that

4050.33 --> 4056.24
basically if you want your elderly to

4052.58 --> 4060.41
survive for long in this age that's

4056.24 --> 4062.3599999999997
serious like just me person like just me

4060.41 --> 4065.5099999999998
personally as a doctor if I was in that

4062.36 --> 4067.52
position that like where I have to be

4065.51 --> 4069.65
responsible for someone's livelihood

4067.52 --> 4071.3
I would I would always try to make sure

4069.65 --> 4073.9700000000003
that whatever I'm recommending to done

4071.3 --> 4075.8300000000004
will help them hence why I once and go

4073.97 --> 4078.02
into holistic I don't want to see toes

4075.83 --> 4080.84
give this to them and it'll work like I

4078.02 --> 4082.82
don't know I want to learn everything I

4080.84 --> 4085.01
want to know what's you know I want to

4082.82 --> 4087.29
know my patient I want to know not just

4085.01 --> 4088.73
not just their you know like their

4087.29 --> 4090.97
biological make I mean of course that's

4088.73 --> 4093.2
very important but also just like

4090.97 --> 4094.79
combining everything else as well like

4093.2 --> 4096.62
what's going on in their personal lives

4094.79 --> 4098.72
and there is no like that what's what's

4096.62 --> 4100.099999999999
the causing them to you know like people

4098.72 --> 4101.4800000000005
come in and they have stress they have

4100.1 --> 4103.67
hypertension it's like okay so what's

4101.48 --> 4105.86
hogging that you know so I guess it's

4103.67 --> 4109.34
kind of a mixture of psychology with

4105.86 --> 4112.73
with Big Lake I guess kind of mixed in

4109.34 --> 4114.56
psychology with um you know like being a

4112.73 --> 4116.599999999999
medical doctor but basically that's how

4114.56 --> 4118.700000000001
it that's how what I would want to go

4116.6 --> 4120.110000000001
into it like that you can't just you

4118.7 --> 4121.88
can't know everything about a patient

4120.11 --> 4124.13
just just by looking at a chart be like

4121.88 --> 4127.55
oh well this will just take this it's

4124.13 --> 4130.76
like that's so cold and and it's not it

4127.55 --> 4134.18
doesn't help it really does like that's

4130.76 --> 4136.280000000001
why like does you know like you're

4134.18 --> 4138.200000000001
you're told that will this'll help but

4136.28 --> 4141.11
it's like that is it really helping

4138.2 --> 4142.82
though it's the person is just staying

4141.11 --> 4144.74
alive and not really getting better

4142.82 --> 4146.36
they're getting more and more dependent

4144.74 --> 4148.61
like you say okay take this they take

4146.36 --> 4150.08
that it's like what is what are we

4148.61 --> 4151.969999999999
really doing here when am I gonna be

4150.08 --> 4153.5
able to stop taking this stuff I've been

4151.97 --> 4153.9800000000005
taking it for 20 years I still have the

4153.5 --> 4156.24
same

4153.98 --> 4160.589999999999
you know it doesn't it doesn't make

4156.24 --> 4162.57
sense yep it's just yeah you have to

4160.59 --> 4164.3
doubt though you have to take control

4162.57 --> 4167.19
off yourself

4164.3 --> 4169.2
what I learn it I be your own doctor be

4167.19 --> 4173.9
responsible for yourself if you can be

4169.2 --> 4176.82
responsible for a career in some way

4173.9 --> 4181.74
right if you have that ability then you

4176.82 --> 4184.469999999999
should also kind of at least try to take

4181.74 --> 4188.58
care of yourself and not be completely

4184.47 --> 4192.39
doctor dependent or like yeah get to

4188.58 --> 4196.38
know a doctor that you yeah can then

4192.39 --> 4199.650000000001
learn to trust before he becomes your

4196.38 --> 4201.59
doctor basically that also be a good way

4199.65 --> 4204.48
to do it

4201.59 --> 4207.57
because yeah I would still be handy to

4204.48 --> 4212.54
have somebody that you can talk with

4207.57 --> 4212.54
that does have a lot of that knowledge

4213.32 --> 4221.45
yes so interesting it's just I basically

4219.9 --> 4226.65
think that it's all just being a

4221.45 --> 4228.51
systematically applied wrong it's wrong

4226.65 --> 4238.32
employees in a way that it was actually

4228.51 --> 4241.77
not really designed for originally let

4238.32 --> 4243.509999999999
go what medicine was more with more ways

4241.77 --> 4246.18
specifically on the person not just

4243.51 --> 4248.16
physically but emotionally like

4246.18 --> 4250.35
spiritually everything like there was a

4248.16 --> 4252.33
time where that was more we're thinking

4250.35 --> 4254.370000000001
more and you know people still do that

4252.33 --> 4257.04
but it's not posted out to the public

4254.37 --> 4259.23
wayward consumed until the mainstream

4257.04 --> 4260.67
medical industry so it's like you don't

4259.23 --> 4262.65
you don't really have that so much

4260.67 --> 4264.99
anymore but they're people know you're

4262.65 --> 4266.79
told at that you know like but that's

4264.99 --> 4269.37
not real but that's not really helping

4266.79 --> 4270.54
you that take don't go to that source

4269.37 --> 4272.7
we're the ones who really know what

4270.54 --> 4278.75
we're talking about but you know it's

4272.7 --> 4281.2699999999995
like it's but it's really it's

4278.75 --> 4283.52
yeah you know it's just raining it's a

4281.27 --> 4285.860000000001
moat like it's just it's really really

4283.52 --> 4287.93
it's frustrating for me

4285.86 --> 4289.339999999999
yeah that's the cake the best a

4287.93 --> 4296.240000000001
statement and that's to say that we're

4289.34 --> 4297.32
it's just like there's so much I'm I'm

4296.24 --> 4299.75
getting I'm getting a little too

4297.32 --> 4301.49
invested in my emotions so I know okay

4299.75 --> 4303.11
words I'm gonna words I'm gonna be able

4301.49 --> 4304.5199999999995
to come out properly so I'm just yeah

4303.11 --> 4306.08
I'm just gonna leave it at that all

4304.52 --> 4310.25
right when you get where I'm thing

4306.08 --> 4312.11
coming from oh yeah yeah well I

4310.25 --> 4315.47
basically lost my mother because of the

4312.11 --> 4322.07
medical system I believe and her trust

4315.47 --> 4324.29
in it like she wanted their own things

4322.07 --> 4326.21
like she wanted to apply herbs and

4324.29 --> 4329.24
everything but she in the end basically

4326.21 --> 4331.94
still surrendered to it and did some

4329.24 --> 4341.24
things on the side so yet that doesn't

4331.94 --> 4343.4
really work apparently but yeah that was

4341.24 --> 4355.54
it's kind of a long time ago for me

4343.4 --> 4358.37
though but still it's still like them I

4355.54 --> 4360.74
mean you one thing that one thing that

4358.37 --> 4363.47
it can help you do is to be an advocate

4360.74 --> 4366.139999999999
for more host more a more holistic folks

4363.47 --> 4369.59
yes that's exactly what happened that's

4366.14 --> 4371.570000000001
exactly what happened I was so shocked

4369.59 --> 4375.02
by figuring out what really happened

4371.57 --> 4378.86
everything afterward and hurt yeah

4375.02 --> 4380.4800000000005
I also thanks it Alex Jones and yep some

4378.86 --> 4382.429999999999
of the more paranoid approach it was

4380.48 --> 4388.509999999999
kind of necessary to break through like

4382.43 --> 4391.1
it's not what it's trying to act it is

4388.51 --> 4395.29
the medical system and what my mother

4391.1 --> 4399.47
mother went through was not inevitable

4395.29 --> 4402.0199999999995
it was just yeah she was not she was

4399.47 --> 4403.31
losing it she couldn't keep oversight

4402.02 --> 4405.02
over things she couldn't apply our

4403.31 --> 4408.71
intellect anymore because she was just

4405.02 --> 4411.38
too stressed out and medication warped

4408.71 --> 4412.22
her in all kinds of ways physically and

4411.38 --> 4416.78
mentally

4412.22 --> 4418.43
and eventually yeah it's just bang and

4416.78 --> 4425.0
then start thinking like yeah if she had

4418.43 --> 4426.56
just hadn't done that she might have

4425.0 --> 4428.48
still be alive and just a totally

4426.56 --> 4433.160000000001
different person as the last phases

4428.48 --> 4435.589999999999
basically so yeah I said just that was a

4433.16 --> 4438.11
giant blow to the face I really felt

4435.59 --> 4440.57
like my home was taken away was also the

4438.11 --> 4443.839999999999
explosion of my family basically that

4440.57 --> 4447.349999999999
that happened we all scattered we used

4443.84 --> 4452.0
to meet a lot after that no more Noah

4447.35 --> 4454.43
not me at least and yeah that that's why

4452.0 --> 4456.68
I dove into this this alternative

4454.43 --> 4459.01
medical knowledge and there was so much

4456.68 --> 4462.77
in there that was so fascinating and

4459.01 --> 4465.83
interesting and memorable I remember a

4462.77 --> 4469.46
lot of it I spent a great deal of time

4465.83 --> 4476.24
just reading it through meticulously all

4469.46 --> 4483.11
these studies and and I applied some of

4476.24 --> 4485.599999999999
it so I start these organic only and use

4483.11 --> 4489.11
colloidal silver you know all that are

4485.6 --> 4495.17
you vegan or vegetarian now

4489.11 --> 4499.04
only for for a little over a year okay

4495.17 --> 4501.86
so you still do eggs and like coconut

4499.04 --> 4505.76
milk really I take a little coffee milk

4501.86 --> 4512.36
like like once a day literally and I

4505.76 --> 4519.92
used cheese can't wait cheese from

4512.36 --> 4521.42
attachment that's too brutal don't over

4519.92 --> 4524.12
eat it because that's not healthy so

4521.42 --> 4526.04
take it spur and when I still eat meat I

4524.12 --> 4528.47
also ate it kind of scary

4526.04 --> 4536.57
not overdoing it because it just made me

4528.47 --> 4538.1900000000005
unhealthy so even our even with right

4536.57 --> 4540.74
yeah you're not really you supposed to

4538.19 --> 4543.23
have a very good balance like what it

4540.74 --> 4545.369
what is your own way would it like what

4543.23 --> 4547.949
is your own approach to sugar

4545.369 --> 4550.259999999999
than anything but do you try not to

4547.949 --> 4551.4
consume a certain amount of sugar do you

4550.26 --> 4555.119000000001
just put it out completely

4551.4 --> 4557.549999999999
Oh sugar no that that would be very

4555.119 --> 4560.098999999999
tough I've been pretty much as sugar and

4557.55 --> 4564.77
junky since I was six maybe even before

4560.099 --> 4567.659000000001
it was terrible like a very serious and

4564.77 --> 4569.55
yeah I'm lucky I still have my teeth

4567.659 --> 4573.659
left but like I kind of learned to quit

4569.55 --> 4576.929
that but yeah it's really hard that's

4573.659 --> 4579.69
right so really I still take like two

4576.929 --> 4583.2300000000005
scoops like small scoops of sugar in my

4579.69 --> 4586.049999999999
coffee and that's really it I don't use

4583.23 --> 4591.23
sugar for anything else I mostly try to

4586.05 --> 4593.969
dive on to my more salty stuff I see

4591.23 --> 4596.79
have you heard of like have you ever

4593.969 --> 4600.449
tried on stevia

4596.79 --> 4603.929
yeah oh you don't like that I don't like

4600.449 --> 4606.089999999999
the D aftertaste of it yeah that's the

4603.929 --> 4608.429
problem with it is felt like it has no

4606.09 --> 4610.71
sugar at all it would literally be it's

4608.429 --> 4613.26
literally the best alternative but it

4610.71 --> 4617.699
doesn't yeah pitocin

4613.26 --> 4620.31
so it's like you can have certain things

4617.699 --> 4622.049999999999
that you can assume that don't have like

4620.31 --> 4624.719
a lot of sugar alcoholic even honey has

4622.05 --> 4626.429
a certain level of sugar alcohol in it

4624.719 --> 4628.02
so you can you can use honey as a

4626.429 --> 4630.119
replacement but it's still gonna yeah as

4628.02 --> 4634.530000000001
the honey no I don't like honey in my

4630.119 --> 4639.199
coffee okay no not in coffee no never

4634.53 --> 4639.199
oh no there's people that do that though

4639.349 --> 4649.92
to each nasty savvy it's nice to be like

4644.19 --> 4654.0599999999995
I can't do that no to eat soon right

4649.92 --> 4656.82
right yeah but I know the only thing

4654.06 --> 4658.56
that I really take sugar in is now

4656.82 --> 4660.929
coffee and I don't drink that too much

4658.56 --> 4664.56
before I started to drink green tea

4660.929 --> 4666.27
though which kind of arrived after a

4664.56 --> 4668.13
while when I started to eat organic I

4666.27 --> 4671.040000000001
figured it out like weights I used to

4668.13 --> 4673.29
drink Earl Grey tea a lot I was like me

4671.04 --> 4674.82
and my brother both were like fanatics

4673.29 --> 4678.37
with that and yeah you can't really

4674.82 --> 4681.59
drink that properly without sugar in it

4678.37 --> 4687.89
but I quit that and basically gave the

4681.59 --> 4689.900000000001
remainder of my tea to my brother of the

4687.89 --> 4691.76
of the Earl Grey tea I like I had a big

4689.9 --> 4693.5
package and I basically like okay I'm

4691.76 --> 4695.99
not gonna finish this you could have it

4693.5 --> 4698.9
it's like the one of the best or graty's

4695.99 --> 4702.7699999999995
in the world organic really good brand

4698.9 --> 4714.41
and just gave it to him like here's a

4702.77 --> 4716.21
gift yeah he was good yeah like wood

4714.41 --> 4718.19
great like there are certain teams like

4716.21 --> 4720.41
one thing I started to do like when I

4718.19 --> 4722.419999999999
was younger I used to put sugar in my

4720.41 --> 4723.29
tea all the time and that's that's the

4722.42 --> 4725.84
reason why I don't really drink coffee

4723.29 --> 4728.21
and I'd like I don't really drink it

4725.84 --> 4730.7300000000005
because because I can't have it without

4728.21 --> 4733.52
sugar because I'm trying to avoid sugar

4730.73 --> 4734.839999999999
I just don't I just don't drink coffee

4733.52 --> 4736.580000000001
like that unless I'll eat it

4734.84 --> 4739.1
illicit trade or something like a latte

4736.58 --> 4742.58
from Starbucks something like that but

4739.1 --> 4744.2300000000005
on but with on green teas and certain

4742.58 --> 4745.55
type of teas have actually equipped

4744.23 --> 4747.889999999999
myself to be able to drink them with

4745.55 --> 4749.54
just the tea and water like nothing in

4747.89 --> 4752.570000000001
it yeah me too and it actually tastes

4749.54 --> 4755.36
really good yeah like you space the teas

4752.57 --> 4757.969999999999
itself and that you it does something to

4755.36 --> 4759.86
you yeah absolutely

4757.97 --> 4762.4400000000005
I like and hey if you really like sweet

4759.86 --> 4765.53
things then you can get certain herbal

4762.44 --> 4768.919999999999
teas that have like these herbs in them

4765.53 --> 4771.5
that are naturally sweet or like like

4768.92 --> 4774.02
the chewing wood type of thing what is

4771.5 --> 4776.09
it licorice licorice roots alone Seng

4774.02 --> 4778.52
there's kinds of teas and that are

4776.09 --> 4782.71
pretty damn sweet just naturally without

4778.52 --> 4785.0
added sugar even so for the three teeth

4782.71 --> 4787.64
there's actually a stress reliever team

4785.0 --> 4790.37
from um I forgot them at of rain but it

4787.64 --> 4793.1
has a sweetness to it and like I was

4790.37 --> 4795.32
having a sucky day and I had some bad

4793.1 --> 4797.6
knit really no no sugar and at the start

4795.32 --> 4800.96
that it was really good you know like

4797.6 --> 4805.1
tea thought like sugar can also can also

4800.96 --> 4807.08
like inhibit that the actual herbal like

4805.1 --> 4809.33
no mechanisms of the tea so I you

4807.08 --> 4810.85
shouldn't ruin the colorful aromas that

4809.33 --> 4814.16
can be within it

4810.85 --> 4818.780000000001
all right fine parts after your own will

4814.16 --> 4820.2699999999995
then just because sherbert yeah I know

4818.78 --> 4822.7699999999995
what you mean

4820.27 --> 4825.64
now coffee not so much because it is

4822.77 --> 4829.070000000001
pretty hard coffee is hard

4825.64 --> 4831.56
yeah I can't I cannot drink coffee

4829.07 --> 4834.469999999999
without sugar that's okay like it's only

4831.56 --> 4839.660000000001
a real serious hard-ass that like drinks

4834.47 --> 4841.280000000001
coffee completely black yeah I know coke

4839.66 --> 4843.73
I know a couple people and I'm just like

4841.28 --> 4846.53
I don't understand English and like oh

4843.73 --> 4848.419999999999
also if you drink coffee by itself you

4846.53 --> 4850.07
have a headache and you drink coffee

4848.42 --> 4852.05
like with nothing in it like it didn't

4850.07 --> 4854.78
help with the headache but that's that's

4852.05 --> 4856.37
a very very rare occasion where I'll do

4854.78 --> 4858.259999999999
that like I tried to just let the

4856.37 --> 4860.15
headache go away on its own mm-hmm well

4858.26 --> 4862.22
I'll take a nap or something or drink

4860.15 --> 4865.969999999999
some water I'm not gonna drink some

4862.22 --> 4868.39
black coffee no no think of it like this

4865.97 --> 4870.34
just that's torture for my body for my

4868.39 --> 4878.780000000001
taste

4870.34 --> 4882.1900000000005
