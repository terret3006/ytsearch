6.21 --> 40.35
[Music]

36.14 --> 43.649
good morning welcome to flatter the

40.35 --> 45.449
earlybird number 255 I'm your host

43.649 --> 47.07
Arwen and before we start to show up

45.449 --> 48.39
please don't forget to share it on any

47.07 --> 50.61
platform you deem fit

48.39 --> 52.230000000000004
except Facebook and please if you

50.61 --> 54.329
haven't already subscribed to my channel

52.23 --> 55.8
and hit the bell notification so you

54.329 --> 58.079
know when I'm going live which is

55.8 --> 60.75
normally 2:00 p.m. amsterdam time every

58.079 --> 63.089
day also please support me through the

60.75 --> 67.22
super chats paypal patreon my GoFundMe

63.089 --> 75.27
much obliged so yeah as you can see

67.22 --> 79.32
today again hot very very hot and also

75.27 --> 84.35
chemtrails my way so much more obvious

79.32 --> 84.35
today than yesterday look at that yuck

84.71 --> 94.11
also the haze doesn't seem to be now so

88.259 --> 99.56
limited to the horizon it's really hazy

94.11 --> 99.56
all around so yeah I don't like that

100.489 --> 106.5
probably gonna end up taking another

102.78 --> 110.459
shower with this heat probably gonna do

106.5 --> 114.539
that anyway but yeah that's gonna stick

110.459 --> 116.399
this evening probably so yeah they have

114.539 --> 123.959
been camp trailing pretty much

116.399 --> 124.709
continually since yesterday I got Tamera

123.959 --> 129.02
coffee today

124.709 --> 131.73
no teeth like I ended up this morning

129.02 --> 133.8
getting my tea pot and it was still half

131.73 --> 135.959
filled from yesterday it's just when

133.8 --> 137.87900000000002
it's this hot drinking tea is just not

135.959 --> 142.06900000000002
gonna happen I do have more lemonade

137.879 --> 142.069
though already halfway through

145.37 --> 153.9
still nice and cold from the freezer

147.78 --> 157.77
from the fridge and an apple do have

153.9 --> 161.91
that ah yeah yesterday was really nice

157.77 --> 163.77
with all the berries and it was pretty

161.91 --> 169.68
interesting because I didn't have any

163.77 --> 181.29000000000002
dinner but from oh yeah I just didn't

169.68 --> 184.26000000000002
need it so how are you all doing I'm

181.29 --> 187.26
going to focus mostly today on the way

184.26 --> 191.76
that I speak because I've noticed and it

187.26 --> 194.73
might be because of the heat that I am

191.76 --> 198.6
becoming somewhat scrambled in my focus

194.73 --> 202.89
on just the way I build my sentences and

198.6 --> 206.37
slip into certain type of words much

202.89 --> 209.48999999999998
more regularly and I can't stand hearing

206.37 --> 211.98000000000002
that and even as I go it's very hard to

209.49 --> 215.64000000000001
snap out of that because it's like a

211.98 --> 217.59
mode you slip into a track it's very

215.64 --> 221.76
hard to get out of it while you're doing

217.59 --> 224.94
it so then certain words keep repeating

221.76 --> 225.69
themselves and now I'm you can already

224.94 --> 229.32
hear it

225.69 --> 231.39
from certain sound effects that are now

229.32 --> 235.04999999999998
adding themselves to the way I speak

231.39 --> 237.17999999999998
compared to the last week really gonna

235.05 --> 241.19
focus on that because it was getting

237.18 --> 241.19
really annoying as [ __ ]

248.71 --> 256.34000000000003
like too many uses of the word

252.2 --> 259.76
especially or actually that kind of

256.34 --> 263.0
thing it's it's like pseudo-intellectual

259.76 --> 267.26
talk and even though it may be

263.0 --> 269.21
technically correct it is just not a

267.26 --> 282.11
proper way to communicate and I don't

269.21 --> 284.75
like it air conditioner yeah yeah well

282.11 --> 287.54
where would I put it here doesn't really

284.75 --> 290.63
work and yeah I can't afford anything

287.54 --> 293.06
like that also my house boss if I were

290.63 --> 297.4
able to install one would get super

293.06 --> 301.33
complainy like the electricity bill and

297.4 --> 304.48999999999995
and I don't want that again

301.33 --> 311.27
so no I'm just gonna have to sit through

304.49 --> 314.69
this heat said yeah I'm just gonna have

311.27 --> 318.59
to face the elements and in a way it's

314.69 --> 320.09
funny enough that it's all a matter of

318.59 --> 322.34
approach what you do with your time

320.09 --> 324.56
because if you don't have a lot of

322.34 --> 328.78999999999996
luxuries then you're gonna be facing the

324.56 --> 332.29
elements a lot well you can complain

328.79 --> 335.36
about it of course and the Dutch are

332.29 --> 337.61
specialized in being very complaining

335.36 --> 342.59000000000003
about the weather whatever it is whether

337.61 --> 346.87
it be hot or cold or an interesting or

342.59 --> 351.08
wet or yeah we're really good at it

346.87 --> 352.79
but what I do is when I do something

351.08 --> 355.09999999999997
like for example go out on a bike ride

352.79 --> 358.25
and it's really hot then I'm gonna take

355.1 --> 363.95000000000005
it as a challenge and try to still be

358.25 --> 371.3
sportive in the heat just to test myself

363.95 --> 373.4
in the elements and I'm doing okay it's

371.3 --> 375.37
weird I get very sweaty and that's just

373.4 --> 380.15999999999997
incredibly annoying

375.37 --> 383.05
but as for my well my heart and just

380.16 --> 385.22900000000004
facing that heat because you really

383.05 --> 389.8
notice that in your blood circulation

385.229 --> 394.78
I'm pretty okay so there was a good a

389.8 --> 398.56
good thing to realize that I don't like

394.78 --> 401.979
heat but I can handle it because I do

398.56 --> 406.75
we're still all black in the giant

401.979 --> 409.9
burning Sun I could wear something white

406.75 --> 415.0
instead but those would like get dirty

409.9 --> 419.38
really quickly and I don't wanna I just

415.0 --> 430.15
I'd rather challenge that he said now

419.38 --> 432.52
that's just me so yeah again I forgot to

430.15 --> 435.90999999999997
get into chat so let's see was there a

432.52 --> 439.21
GM popped in earlier and Steve and he

435.91 --> 441.0
said he had to leave though before the

439.21 --> 447.90999999999997
show started

441.0 --> 456.479
Daniel I mean a young arrested oh okay

447.91 --> 456.47900000000004
that one guy he hello Obama Co pumpkin

460.83 --> 469.85999999999996
more colored lumberjack Jason mcCormick

465.66 --> 473.52000000000004
I killed a hope Fyodor Dostoevsky Uncle

469.86 --> 475.86
Bob it's really weird

473.52 --> 481.849
you know I actually have an angry and

475.86 --> 481.849
uncle called Bob said that but anyway

483.5 --> 492.479
Tesla Apple that's last Apple yeah good

487.289 --> 499.259
morning all of you yeah mark color I

492.479 --> 509.31
appreciate lightning storms as well it's

499.259 --> 510.03000000000003
nice it really clears up the air so yeah

509.31 --> 513.3
I haven't

510.03 --> 520.01
to be fair I haven't looked into any of

513.3 --> 523.709
the Feynman lectures today too hot and

520.01 --> 527.55
still getting yeah working through the

523.709 --> 529.9799999999999
disappointment from yesterday but I have

527.55 --> 534.99
to get over that and move through it was

529.98 --> 540.149
I didn't expect on the debates to have a

534.99 --> 543.24
conversation about it with with quantum

540.149 --> 548.779
eraser that was weird especially because

543.24 --> 554.61
he I didn't I barely recognized him I

548.779 --> 556.95
really didn't like I told him my issues

554.61 --> 559.22
with it and he was like oh but but he's

556.95 --> 563.73
really good at explaining though he was

559.22 --> 568.8000000000001
apologetic didn't expect that the guy

563.73 --> 571.74
has this weird predisposed love for

568.8 --> 574.02
anything quantum mechanics related so

571.74 --> 575.82
he's more it seems to be very forgiving

574.02 --> 580.1999999999999
towards anything in that sector

575.82 --> 582.779
maybe that is also or hopefully part of

580.2 --> 584.82
an attitude change because I am

582.779 --> 587.579
absolutely now engaging in learning

584.82 --> 588.9300000000001
quantum mechanics and despite the

587.579 --> 591.029
disappointment doesn't mean it's going

588.93 --> 592.89
to end absolutely not I will dig through

591.029 --> 595.87
but the damn heat you know

592.89 --> 602.17
maybe I need a lightning storm to get

595.87 --> 604.03
through it so people can hear me walking

602.17 --> 608.4599999999999
out and just laughing maniacally while

604.03 --> 617.28
thunder rages haha I finally understand

608.46 --> 617.2800000000001
hahaha yeah that would work much better

625.38 --> 632.65
but I think that quantum eraser may have

628.33 --> 635.46
a better liking to me now that I'm

632.65 --> 641.14
engaging in this I pretty sure that

635.46 --> 644.1700000000001
Nathan hasn't so we'll see what I did

641.14 --> 647.59
it's not something I expected I expected

644.17 --> 653.41
him to actually be discouraging and that

647.59 --> 655.36
just goes to say that my understanding

653.41 --> 657.28
of who John is was somewhat

655.36 --> 663.04
oversimplified there are more dimensions

657.28 --> 666.99
to this and I'm gonna have to refigure

663.04 --> 670.48
it out who is this guy

666.99 --> 672.58
but we'll see because as I'm going

670.48 --> 675.28
through this I'm sure there will be much

672.58 --> 678.1
more obstacles and he might at some

675.28 --> 681.0899999999999
point be very angry as to assert certain

678.1 --> 684.0400000000001
stances that I might take I might end up

681.09 --> 687.1600000000001
totally working out for example how

684.04 --> 691.2099999999999
light is a wave concept I don't know yet

687.16 --> 693.9399999999999
I am reluctant to do that at this point

691.21 --> 699.7900000000001
although a particle seems nonsensical to

693.94 --> 703.6300000000001
me I don't know what it is yet but yeah

699.79 --> 705.73
we might end up being in opposite

703.63 --> 708.39
opinion camps but I don't know how he

705.73 --> 711.07
will be in that maybe he will be very

708.39 --> 714.55
much more like a colleague a respecting

711.07 --> 717.58
colleague because it's quantum mechanics

714.55 --> 721.2099999999999
who knows it's it's weird it'd probably

717.58 --> 723.49
be more logical to just ask him but I

721.21 --> 725.0300000000001
don't know I don't remember having I

723.49 --> 730.42
ever really having a

725.03 --> 735.02
a normal talk so I don't know let's just

730.42 --> 736.37
see where this goes and yeah he did calm

735.02 --> 739.97
down a lot Amanda young

736.37 --> 742.7
but it's also because I think he did pay

739.97 --> 746.75
a lot of attention to wider criticism

742.7 --> 763.0600000000001
not just by the specific quantum eraser

746.75 --> 768.52
haters and the Savannah is out there now

763.06 --> 768.52
did he say that mark color that's weird

770.02 --> 775.4
in a way in a metaphorical way that is

773.39 --> 779.42
kind of sensible to say because so much

775.4 --> 781.91
about quantum mechanics is finding a way

779.42 --> 787.16
to observe things without disturbing

781.91 --> 789.38
them so you are dealing with the dark

787.16 --> 796.2199999999999
side of reality the things that are

789.38 --> 796.76
elusive that cannot be let up be seen so

796.22 --> 800.21
easily

796.76 --> 806.26
so yeah that's sorry I guess it's a

800.21 --> 806.26
quantum mechanical joke but yes

814.99 --> 821.45
mm-hmm

817.13 --> 822.83
right I mean y'all agree and a chronic

821.45 --> 825.8900000000001
problem and I don't think it'll ever

822.83 --> 828.89
really go away is that he's had just has

825.89 --> 832.91
a hunger for spending a lot of energy

828.89 --> 837.08
and time and focus on humiliating the

832.91 --> 842.03
people that he deals with like he enjoys

837.08 --> 846.2800000000001
it too much it's just not healthy and

842.03 --> 846.28
it's not morally right

852.6 --> 861.74
it's its hunger for a humiliation of

857.31 --> 865.53
others that's not a good trait that's

861.74 --> 873.72
that's like the love for money it's not

865.53 --> 878.52
right and he should have his conscious

873.72 --> 884.4
focus on that that it is not right to do

878.52 --> 887.61
that that in my opinion is morally right

884.4 --> 891.3299999999999
and Christian and if he can't then he

887.61 --> 893.79
has a very serious problem then you

891.33 --> 896.97
could stay to a way that he is not in

893.79 --> 900.9599999999999
control of himself and by the way he's

896.97 --> 903.72
not alone at that like right the hand is

900.96 --> 906.1800000000001
even worse and there's more individuals

903.72 --> 908.34
out there that just have so so little

906.18 --> 911.9599999999999
self control that they become obsessed

908.34 --> 915.57
with attacking others trying to

911.96 --> 918.27
humiliate them and it's it's it's a love

915.57 --> 921.9000000000001
or a hunger for a humiliation of others

918.27 --> 925.9499999999999
and that it to my as far as the

921.9 --> 932.67
frequency wise that seems to be a sin to

925.95 --> 933.8100000000001
me would you not agree I don't like to

932.67 --> 937.68
humiliate others

933.81 --> 942.9599999999999
I do see MIT as like it's necessary also

937.68 --> 945.18
out of self-defense but I always do try

942.96 --> 949.98
to minimize it until I get caught up in

945.18 --> 953.01
an are winnie enrage and then but yeah

949.98 --> 955.53
that's afterwards I always paid the

953.01 --> 957.42
price because I wake up from that and

955.53 --> 960.75
then I see oh [ __ ] what did I do

957.42 --> 964.4399999999999
and okay I was technically correct but I

960.75 --> 968.18
went too far and I guess by the general

964.44 --> 972.2700000000001
standards that that is kind of normal

968.18 --> 975.8399999999999
sort of but in myself I do definitely

972.27 --> 979.4
feel like yeah technically correct

975.84 --> 983.7800000000001
that's really nice it was really smart

979.4 --> 986.23
very critically thought out things and

983.78 --> 990.1
descriptions but it still

986.23 --> 992.83
really right sometimes sometimes it is

990.1 --> 995.89
sometimes it is literally just me as a

992.83 --> 999.97
maneuver trying to really shove

995.89 --> 1003.03
somebody's negative actions into their

999.97 --> 1005.0400000000001
face like shock them with it so they

1003.03 --> 1008.8199999999999
don't build up a shield against it as

1005.04 --> 1013.29
you face them with it but that's not a

1008.82 --> 1015.45
sin because it works to a degree but

1013.29 --> 1018.51
when it's like face to face and I keep

1015.45 --> 1021.0600000000001
on pushing it then it becomes a

1018.51 --> 1024.18
back-and-forth rage and afterwards it's

1021.06 --> 1029.19
always useless it's always leaves more

1024.18 --> 1033.3600000000001
damage then it actually helped construct

1029.19 --> 1036.45
something or develop something and then

1033.36 --> 1039.03
it feels like I've sinned not really

1036.45 --> 1042.6000000000001
badly it's just a mistake but it's it's

1039.03 --> 1044.3999999999999
still stupid just like yeah going

1042.6 --> 1048.0
through a red light when there's a cop

1044.4 --> 1051.3600000000001
car right in front of it you know that's

1048.0 --> 1056.31
also mistake it's also stupid just as

1051.36 --> 1064.62
much it's not really evil but it's still

1056.31 --> 1068.3999999999999
wrong obviously to me I don't know maybe

1064.62 --> 1070.59
I'm just very morally sensitive while

1068.4 --> 1074.42
most of the world has been completely

1070.59 --> 1077.55
morally desensitized about the details

1074.42 --> 1080.78
but I am sensitive to the details it is

1077.55 --> 1087.0
also something that I find very charming

1080.78 --> 1092.19
from reenactments type acting from old

1087.0 --> 1096.63
ways because there's so much detail to

1092.19 --> 1099.21
them and I kind of as a spiritual talk

1096.63 --> 1101.2800000000002
understand it even though they are done

1099.21 --> 1103.65
are sometimes done by actors that are

1101.28 --> 1107.55
not even fully into it there's just

1103.65 --> 1111.8400000000001
mimicking it but there is something to

1107.55 --> 1115.4099999999999
the old wood to just all these ways of

1111.84 --> 1119.31
doing things and and what naturally

1115.41 --> 1120.19
comes as a side effect to that there is

1119.31 --> 1122.98
some

1120.19 --> 1124.8400000000001
there is something special to it and it

1122.98 --> 1126.73
feels like in the last century

1124.84 --> 1132.4199999999998
especially we've just been completely

1126.73 --> 1140.2
derailed put on a false path and then

1132.42 --> 1143.2
and we've been presented with a a giant

1140.2 --> 1146.32
box of pieces but without any blueprint

1143.2 --> 1149.32
and as how to build it when normally in

1146.32 --> 1151.4399999999998
the old days it was obvious how to build

1149.32 --> 1156.8799999999999
it

1151.44 --> 1159.69
that's that's a rough comparison we have

1156.88 --> 1162.3100000000002
all this stuff but we've all been

1159.69 --> 1165.31
brainwashed so we don't really know how

1162.31 --> 1170.73
to use it all anymore we don't know how

1165.31 --> 1174.1599999999999
to manage real priorities so much and I

1170.73 --> 1177.25
think these days that I'm relatively

1174.16 --> 1179.89
wise especially compared to old times

1177.25 --> 1184.3
but still still there are these things

1179.89 --> 1187.1200000000001
that then get overlooked because I don't

1184.3 --> 1189.22
get exposed with that anymore in the

1187.12 --> 1192.34
general culture the general culture is

1189.22 --> 1200.44
just completely derail turn to to acting

1192.34 --> 1204.52
and to blind wild behavior so there's

1200.44 --> 1206.92
nothing to remember you about the the

1204.52 --> 1210.12
the old detailed behaviors anymore

1206.92 --> 1213.7
except for reenactment that's just a

1210.12 --> 1216.2399999999998
very small part of what it really was

1213.7 --> 1216.24
going on

1221.04 --> 1228.36
[Music]

1223.76 --> 1230.4
yeah sorry Jose look if you have any gay

1228.36 --> 1232.5
feelings you're gonna have to deal with

1230.4 --> 1239.7900000000002
them yourself I'm not responsible for

1232.5 --> 1243.44
people's yeah gay impulses you know in

1239.79 --> 1247.28
my opinion it's not gay to be as a man

1243.44 --> 1258.8
to be exposed upper chest

1247.28 --> 1258.8
okay so and besides it's really hot

1265.12 --> 1268.12
yeah

1278.91 --> 1291.93
ah God is is this is this really so

1286.53 --> 1293.76
distracting come on guys you're still

1291.93 --> 1297.5700000000002
listening to me right you're not just

1293.76 --> 1301.44
staring at this like focus on this okay

1297.57 --> 1314.12
focus on this thank you now listen no

1301.44 --> 1314.1200000000001
longer intimidated by my pipes what what

1317.97 --> 1321.17
[Music]

1327.63 --> 1341.7800000000002
oh dear well I really have very modest

1337.77 --> 1345.99
man nipples so it's not like they're

1341.78 --> 1349.47
right it's not like they're huge or

1345.99 --> 1351.36
whatever I haven't had much soy when I

1349.47 --> 1360.77
was young so that did help

1351.36 --> 1365.1299999999999
and this really is mostly muscle so and

1360.77 --> 1368.9089999999999
bone I don't have a lot of fat on me

1365.13 --> 1374.0100000000002
that's you can definitely use this SSI

1368.909 --> 1380.0590000000002
the phone but I feel great I feel

1374.01 --> 1384.48
healthy especially for a 40 I am amazed

1380.059 --> 1388.77
to bump into people man and female of

1384.48 --> 1392.159
male and female of my age and just see

1388.77 --> 1395.6689999999999
how freaking old they look I'm just like

1392.159 --> 1401.0100000000002
what is going on what happened to these

1395.669 --> 1404.13
people I don't get it was it regular

1401.01 --> 1407.789
vaccines or all the deterrence in the

1404.13 --> 1410.3600000000001
regular shampoos and like what can cause

1407.789 --> 1412.19
all these people to eat so quickly I

1410.36 --> 1416.2199999999998
don't get it

1412.19 --> 1418.38
it's a constant cell phone exposure or

1416.22 --> 1420.99
maybe it literally is the combination of

1418.38 --> 1423.9
all of it and they just don't notice it

1420.99 --> 1425.7
they just take the ate the rabbit aging

1423.9 --> 1429.99
for granted like that's normal like yeah

1425.7 --> 1432.169
I am so busy you know you get over is it

1429.99 --> 1432.169
that

1442.97 --> 1454.3
so yeah is also at that I seem to be

1447.71 --> 1454.3
drawn very much at women in their 20s

1454.42 --> 1462.5
which is good because during my 20s I

1458.45 --> 1465.74
seem to be attracted mostly to girls

1462.5 --> 1469.31
just around 80 it was weird

1465.74 --> 1471.8
I felt a lot younger and the confidence

1469.31 --> 1474.08
level was more like that

1471.8 --> 1476.72
I was stuck like that for a long time

1474.08 --> 1478.1299999999999
but now I don't know I'm not attracted

1476.72 --> 1480.31
to the really young ones anywhere it's

1478.13 --> 1480.3100000000002
like

1486.35 --> 1493.279
I think nah unless you know I don't know

1491.36 --> 1500.029
what are that there is still always the

1493.279 --> 1502.519
fertility aspect so that is also

1500.029 --> 1506.269
important to me because I my biggest

1502.519 --> 1508.009
priority in the end I'm not gonna lose

1506.269 --> 1511.34
track of it anymore I'm not gonna bypass

1508.009 --> 1513.2
the decision making at it is that I want

1511.34 --> 1516.74
kids and I want them to be healthy I

1513.2 --> 1519.74
want them to be I want them to have a

1516.74 --> 1522.789
mother that is just as serious about it

1519.74 --> 1526.07
as I am that is really willing to oppose

1522.789 --> 1528.889
the state and the mind control and all

1526.07 --> 1533.629
of it and take big risks to protect

1528.889 --> 1537.6789999999999
their kid and is willing to face the

1533.629 --> 1540.379
width of the public basically because

1537.679 --> 1547.3990000000001
that might happen and it's necessary I

1540.379 --> 1551.809
need I need a female mother soldier that

1547.399 --> 1554.899
is ready to really get with because

1551.809 --> 1558.769
being a parent is really is gonna get

1554.899 --> 1568.1899999999998
more serious and more serious if you are

1558.769 --> 1574.519
will if you are if if you want your

1568.19 --> 1576.559
progeny to keep on going and having kids

1574.519 --> 1578.57
of their own and continue that cycle

1576.559 --> 1585.259
it's going to be a battle to do that

1578.57 --> 1588.649
because all this indoctrination that's

1585.259 --> 1593.779
not gonna end very quickly it might ramp

1588.649 --> 1598.9399999999998
down a bit and especially all the little

1593.779 --> 1603.679
philia crap might be definitely cut off

1598.94 --> 1606.23
but the rest of it I don't know I have a

1603.679 --> 1608.1200000000001
very distinct fear that they will keep

1606.23 --> 1610.58
it in there even though that doesn't

1608.12 --> 1614.299
really make any sense that even the

1610.58 --> 1617.09
right wing the supposed right wing once

1614.299 --> 1619.039
the yeah the the big leftist machine is

1617.09 --> 1619.77
truly broken that they'll still keep

1619.039 --> 1623.1299999999999
some of

1619.77 --> 1626.0
I don't know maybe they it's hard to

1623.13 --> 1627.8400000000001
tell because once that happens

1626.0 --> 1631.32
everything is going to recrystallize

1627.84 --> 1633.3
around a new group formations instantly

1631.32 --> 1634.8899999999999
because the one of the biggest

1633.3 --> 1636.62
frameworks is just collapsed so

1634.89 --> 1640.679
everything's gonna have to regroup then

1636.62 --> 1645.4799999999998
like even with my visions I don't know

1640.679 --> 1648.8700000000001
for sure what it'll end up with its from

1645.48 --> 1653.96
what I gathered in much later situations

1648.87 --> 1659.1899999999998
it ended a pretty divided like with

1653.96 --> 1663.27
uncertainty on many sides and then later

1659.19 --> 1667.23
it maneuvered back into a better

1663.27 --> 1673.74
situation with more sensible economy and

1667.23 --> 1677.16
but this is like we had still all this

1673.74 --> 1681.36
stuff with with with Trump and Iran in

1677.16 --> 1684.23
North Korea and all that's and all that

1681.36 --> 1684.2299999999998
still has to happen

1696.29 --> 1707.81
yes Uncle Bob it does seem self it's

1700.64 --> 1712.46
just that I'm surprised and unnerved by

1707.81 --> 1716.6
seeing that what I stuck to 20 years ago

1712.46 --> 1719.21
roughly what I woke up to and despite

1716.6 --> 1721.76
being mangled coming out of it making a

1719.21 --> 1726.25
decision I'm going to fix myself I'm I'm

1721.76 --> 1726.25
not gonna go with the dark world ship

1727.42 --> 1733.0700000000002
with the dark side that I dealt with in

1731.69 --> 1737.1200000000001
the dark world basically

1733.07 --> 1740.54
and all these predictions were already

1737.12 --> 1742.9099999999999
made like yeah four through Alex Jones

1740.54 --> 1745.28
and and other alternative health people

1742.91 --> 1747.65
that I was dealing with also even face

1745.28 --> 1751.0
to face and my dad was doing that a lot

1747.65 --> 1753.74
and through him I was into alternative

1751.0 --> 1755.9
medicine and techniques and healing I

1753.74 --> 1761.93
learned a couple of things even myself

1755.9 --> 1764.15
at it I learned so much and it was just

1761.93 --> 1766.16
taught that yes all these things that

1764.15 --> 1768.1100000000001
are implemented all the chemicals in the

1766.16 --> 1771.8600000000001
food the fluoride in the water the

1768.11 --> 1776.78
bisphenol A in the plastic bottles the

1771.86 --> 1779.33
fluoride in the toothpaste all these

1776.78 --> 1781.7
things they aged and especially

1779.33 --> 1785.6599999999999
combining one with another they all

1781.7 --> 1789.32
start to then lace your body and start

1785.66 --> 1793.0400000000002
to degrade certain organs and then yeah

1789.32 --> 1796.55
the overall average result is increased

1793.04 --> 1800.3899999999999
aging by noticeable percentages that was

1796.55 --> 1807.35
the talk and I heard that and I was like

1800.39 --> 1810.1100000000001
I just felt like that is messed up but

1807.35 --> 1812.3
it is right I know this is right like I

1810.11 --> 1816.53
was convinced I know this is right I'm

1812.3 --> 1818.12
gonna go organic full-on I'm gonna pay

1816.53 --> 1820.6399999999999
I'm gonna get a water filter I'm gonna

1818.12 --> 1823.28
get an air filter like I have one right

1820.64 --> 1824.75
there I just clean it up today I'm

1823.28 --> 1826.94
really glad I did because there was a

1824.75 --> 1831.02
pile of dust in it

1826.94 --> 1836.03
works much better now I've got into all

1831.02 --> 1838.91
that over the time and then I started

1836.03 --> 1842.03
basically living my life at a well

1838.91 --> 1844.0400000000002
development wise slow pace but Kiev kept

1842.03 --> 1847.37
on learning a lot and now it's roughly

1844.04 --> 1851.09
twenty years later and all the people of

1847.37 --> 1854.4499999999998
my age that didn't do all that that what

1851.09 --> 1857.33
I did and they just got career sort of

1854.45 --> 1860.57
they're doing financially well a little

1857.33 --> 1863.87
bit better than me definitely but not

1860.57 --> 1865.3999999999999
super great most of them I think some of

1863.87 --> 1868.6999999999998
them probably but I don't know they'll

1865.4 --> 1873.02
probably I'll never bump into them or

1868.7 --> 1875.63
they'll hide it I don't know and just

1873.02 --> 1878.51
people yeah they're older they look

1875.63 --> 1882.1100000000001
older than me and then now I have

1878.51 --> 1885.62
basically did the afterword empirical

1882.11 --> 1887.81
proof almost although it's it's just one

1885.62 --> 1890.3899999999999
test I need to find other people that

1887.81 --> 1893.1499999999999
went roughly through the same thing as I

1890.39 --> 1899.3300000000002
did in the same way and then look at

1893.15 --> 1899.93
them age wise how do they look how old

1899.33 --> 1904.09
am I

1899.93 --> 1904.0900000000001
well I'm 39

1910.68 --> 1914.99
so

1912.53 --> 1920.8999999999999
and I look pretty damn good for my age I

1914.99 --> 1923.96
think but I'm also not gonna be having

1920.9 --> 1929.1200000000001
an attitude about it like oh I am so

1923.96 --> 1933.7
good no I think this is normal I think

1929.12 --> 1938.78
that through as part of the entire

1933.7 --> 1940.8500000000001
overarching system of us being

1938.78 --> 1945.2
influenced and poisoned and programmed

1940.85 --> 1948.1599999999999
and normalized into behaviors that are

1945.2 --> 1953.15
not really productive or good for us I

1948.16 --> 1957.3500000000001
think that it's just being made accept

1953.15 --> 1960.5300000000002
it that you grow old get certain issues

1957.35 --> 1963.6799999999998
get sick get on medication and then end

1960.53 --> 1968.95
up like a plant or dead

1963.68 --> 1971.1200000000001
and that's normal now and it's literally

1968.95 --> 1974.81
implanted in the younger people like

1971.12 --> 1979.2199999999998
yeah that happens so they're not gonna

1974.81 --> 1983.12
pursue any reason as to why and if that

1979.22 --> 1985.46
is supposed to be normal they'll a and

1983.12 --> 1986.84
if they do try to inquire any

1985.46 --> 1988.3700000000001
information about it they'll be

1986.84 --> 1990.97
historically referenced with the

1988.37 --> 1993.59
standard [ __ ] stories excuses

1990.97 --> 1996.5
medieval times people were super small

1993.59 --> 2002.6699999999998
and barely had anything to eat and idle

1996.5 --> 2007.24
young and really and that's supposed to

2002.67 --> 2009.76
be a good comparison to this no I don't

2007.24 --> 2015.16
think so I think that if we take away

2009.76 --> 2018.91
all that crap that humans could on

2015.16 --> 2024.28
average have a lifespan of a hundred and

2018.91 --> 2028.69
twenty years on average that's what I

2024.28 --> 2033.55
think if all this toxic crap was taken

2028.69 --> 2037.8400000000001
away and if that happens there may also

2033.55 --> 2040.69
even as a result of that be a more

2037.84 --> 2045.1
sensible energy management in every one

2040.69 --> 2046.269
of us that'll cause us to not switch so

2045.1 --> 2050.0789999999997
back and forth but

2046.269 --> 2051.549
we need the attitude of no I'm not going

2050.079 --> 2054.6090000000004
to have children because there's too

2051.549 --> 2056.74
many people or we're getting attacked I

2054.609 --> 2059.98
need to get as many children as I want I

2056.74 --> 2063.1899999999996
think that if all the talk so crap was

2059.98 --> 2065.7400000000002
taken away then we wouldn't switch to

2063.19 --> 2069.48
such a radical defensive mode at that

2065.74 --> 2073.089
anymore and people will be much more

2069.48 --> 2082.649
sensible naturally in their reproduction

2073.089 --> 2087.99
and balanced so I think that the overall

2082.649 --> 2091.679
circumstances have made us look very bad

2087.99 --> 2094.4799999999996
humanity looks very distasteful and

2091.679 --> 2100.029
polluted and idiotic

2094.48 --> 2102.4
bad decisions but if we take the crap

2100.029 --> 2105.849
away the bad decisions that are being

2102.4 --> 2108.42
offered like yeah will you buy into some

2105.849 --> 2114.579
story and then inject yourself with

2108.42 --> 2116.89
extremely toxic poison well if that

2114.579 --> 2120.579
indoctrination wasn't there then why

2116.89 --> 2122.7889999999998
would people do it and then they would

2120.579 --> 2126.4900000000002
not have any brain damage from that

2122.789 --> 2130.8900000000003
resulting in half their life struggling

2126.49 --> 2135.8489999999997
with basic social issues for example or

2130.89 --> 2141.7889999999998
concentration issues on basic cognitive

2135.849 --> 2146.2000000000003
functions and then the average would

2141.789 --> 2148.779
have become much better and a critical

2146.2 --> 2152.529
mass spiritually would probably be

2148.779 --> 2157.42
reached making it much harder for people

2152.529 --> 2159.789
to evade common sense naturally because

2157.42 --> 2162.67
the energy would be so high you would

2159.789 --> 2167.6800000000003
simply be drawn back into good behavior

2162.67 --> 2171.339
and you would just the the path would be

2167.68 --> 2174.279
much better lit by the energies by the

2171.339 --> 2177.069
spirits by the resonating spirits so it

2174.279 --> 2177.8
would be much harder to stave off the

2177.069 --> 2181.37
path because

2177.8 --> 2183.5600000000004
it's lit so well well if it's all

2181.37 --> 2186.2799999999997
darkened and everything is confused yeah

2183.56 --> 2188.93
you can easily stumble off the path and

2186.28 --> 2191.2400000000002
then it's up to you to recognize you

2188.93 --> 2193.73
have stumbled off and find the path back

2191.24 --> 2197.1499999999996
again as quick as possible but it's well

2193.73 --> 2200.03
lit up you won't accidentally stumble

2197.15 --> 2202.82
away so easily so that's very

2200.03 --> 2213.19
metaphorical but I think it definitely

2202.82 --> 2213.19
is yeah it is a good metaphor I think

2231.26 --> 2238.4500000000003
all right Oh Theodore the stuff i think

2235.73 --> 2244.72
joe rogan admitted he had hair

2238.45 --> 2244.72
transplants i think so

2248.499 --> 2251.499
maybe

2253.07 --> 2257.6000000000004
and now he's pretty much bald so it's

2255.59 --> 2266.9
not really but I think he might have

2257.6 --> 2269.5899999999997
tried it out oh wait wait who are you

2266.9 --> 2269.59
talking about

2272.31 --> 2278.36
scars from her who are you talking about

2276.0 --> 2278.36
me

2291.17 --> 2295.4300000000003
fyodor dostoyevsky

2302.14 --> 2312.009
all right okay you were talking about

2305.14 --> 2315.759
your rolling right right yeah well look

2312.009 --> 2319.9
I can tell you when I was early in my

2315.759 --> 2322.66
20s and you could say the first signs of

2319.9 --> 2326.109
what see like a slight hair alteration

2322.66 --> 2328.989
did definitely happen roughly around my

2326.109 --> 2331.769
20s and at first I was like oh my god no

2328.989 --> 2334.989
I'm not gonna turn Paul please please no

2331.769 --> 2336.5789999999997
and I was already thinking in my head

2334.989 --> 2339.579
like yeah maybe I should get that

2336.579 --> 2343.48
because I wouldn't want to but hey it

2339.579 --> 2346.779
turned out it didn't aggravate and my

2343.48 --> 2350.319
friends at the time yeah they went

2346.779 --> 2351.819
freaking bold many of them did me know

2350.319 --> 2355.21
it's this is it

2351.819 --> 2359.739
and yeah it it's not very thick hair so

2355.21 --> 2363.2200000000003
it looks kind of weird sometimes but it

2359.739 --> 2364.45
is there and it does regrow even it's

2363.22 --> 2368.7099999999996
not yeah

2364.45 --> 2375.249
there's new hairs growing back when they

2368.71 --> 2377.559
break so I'm just very happy why yeah

2375.249 --> 2382.6499999999996
because it's hot the plain truth that's

2377.559 --> 2382.65
why it's very very freaking hot hair

2408.26 --> 2415.9900000000002
like really really hot heist on monkey

2437.369 --> 2441.21
oh god I think I'm gonna address a troll

2439.799 --> 2443.15
because that's the only way we're gonna

2441.21 --> 2449.069
get back into Flat Earth for once

2443.15 --> 2453.059
so negate your XX hello it's weird you

2449.069 --> 2459.69
are okay with things falling but not by

2453.059 --> 2462.42
gravity oh it's that bill G yeah oh it's

2459.69 --> 2467.039
not magical though it's simply relative

2462.42 --> 2469.079
density disequilibrium and within the

2467.039 --> 2471.4500000000003
spectrum of all things and the funny

2469.079 --> 2474.029
thing is you could approach it slightly

2471.45 --> 2479.029
different and call it the polarization

2474.029 --> 2479.029
of the realm so there is a a

2479.089 --> 2488.299
polarization effect that happens on all

2483.96 --> 2492.39
matter depending on their density and

2488.299 --> 2494.849
this polarization effect expresses

2492.39 --> 2498.6299999999997
itself in relative density

2494.849 --> 2503.579
disequilibrium or displacement caused by

2498.63 --> 2504.799
relative density disequilibrium it's not

2503.579 --> 2509.15
magical

2504.799 --> 2515.549
you can definitely extra extrapolate

2509.15 --> 2519.119
mathematical things from it patterns if

2515.549 --> 2521.009
you really wanted to put it into graphs

2519.119 --> 2526.289
that's one of the things that I learned

2521.009 --> 2529.229
in in school just figure out what is the

2526.289 --> 2531.9500000000003
pattern of this where is it going where

2529.229 --> 2531.95
is it going to end up

2540.98 --> 2548.07

whoo peanuts Clark thanks for the offer

2548.07 --> 2558.19
why is your penguin wearing a fedora by

2558.19 --> 2564.91
some ice cream thingies but I didn't I

2560.859 --> 2571.96
just chose to go for it the liquids it's

2564.91 --> 2574.8999999999996
much better anyway I just cream has too

2571.96 --> 2578.3

2588.05 --> 2595.07
okay stone monkey 3d sure I'd love to

2590.78 --> 2601.84
assist you at that to me how it works is

2595.07 --> 2605.78
very clear by now and if I'd have a 3d

2601.84 --> 2608.53
videographer assistant then I could put

2605.78 --> 2611.5400000000004
it down in a really high-tech

2608.53 --> 2613.67
presentation with their help because I

2611.54 --> 2617.5099999999998
know how to present it I just know how

2613.67 --> 2620.17
don't know how to get that done in the

2617.51 --> 2620.17
computer world

2636.33 --> 2639.3199999999997
hmm

2641.18 --> 2648.069
okay interesting Aaron more more felt

2644.41 --> 2653.8999999999996
white is an art that's so similar to my

2648.069 --> 2659.5389999999998
conceptualization of electricity a narc

2653.9 --> 2665.359
right and the arc rides the wave what

2659.539 --> 2667.73
wave carries all things so you're gonna

2665.359 --> 2670.91
presuppose there is a wave of all things

2667.73 --> 2674.48
that sound that's that seems like

2670.91 --> 2677.21
Einstein in deductive thinking I'm not

2674.48 --> 2685.549
gonna entertain that until I get a

2677.21 --> 2688.4900000000002
really good reason to I'm not convinced

2685.549 --> 2690.41
about the whole wave thing because you

2688.49 --> 2693.89
got to figure out what is a wave in the

2690.41 --> 2698.799
first place like a sound wave it is a

2693.89 --> 2702.529
medium transfer the medium itself is

2698.799 --> 2706.94
altered by the passage of a wave that is

2702.529 --> 2709.039
what a wave is a sound wave it's the

2706.94 --> 2714.77
displacement of the medium that is the

2709.039 --> 2718.789
wave light that's not what light

2714.77 --> 2721.7889999999998
effectively does besides a wave like

2718.789 --> 2724.01
sound the things that are specifically

2721.789 --> 2727.94
waves that are medium transfer based

2724.01 --> 2732.65
they can't move through a vacuum a light

2727.94 --> 2736.4900000000002
can move through a vacuum so there you

2732.65 --> 2738.589
go if light was a wave then it would

2736.49 --> 2743.14
require a medium or it could not

2738.589 --> 2748.069
manifest and that is not the case that

2743.14 --> 2749.8689999999997
is a preliminary argument for me to

2748.069 --> 2751.94
suggest that it's not a wave and it's

2749.869 --> 2757.13
very strong evidence it's simply

2751.94 --> 2759.049
comparing all the different things how

2757.13 --> 2762.2000000000003
they can transfer can electricity

2759.049 --> 2764.049
transfer through a vacuum I don't think

2762.2 --> 2765.6499999999996
so

2764.049 --> 2768.589
although yeah

2765.65 --> 2771.529
a perfect vacuum would be required to

2768.589 --> 2773.0
make electrical transfer absolutely

2771.529 --> 2775.31
impossible

2773.0 --> 2778.55
and a perfect vacuum can practically not

2775.31 --> 2781.34
be made so there will always be some

2778.55 --> 2785.27
gases that can eventually transfer the

2781.34 --> 2788.42
electricity l electricity or the the

2785.27 --> 2791.99
connection in if the energy is

2788.42 --> 2796.099
sufficient the tension field reaches far

2791.99 --> 2799.6699999999996
enough so that could happen but yeah in

2796.099 --> 2802.79
it theoretically how god that's kind of

2799.67 --> 2806.66
not useful to use that but theoretically

2802.79 --> 2808.52
electricity can't go through a vacuum as

2806.66 --> 2810.5899999999997
I'm concerned because it needs to be

2808.52 --> 2816.7599999999998
conducted and it does that through

2810.59 --> 2816.76
material right

2823.78 --> 2838.9500000000003
old CRT TV s passes electrons through

2828.55 --> 2838.9500000000003
what vacuum tubes now look the thing is

2839.85 --> 2851.3199999999997
electricity needs a medium like not a

2846.54 --> 2853.9
magnetic about a magnetic field because

2851.32 --> 2857.94
that reaches that can reach through a

2853.9 --> 2860.65
vacuum definitely but an actual

2857.94 --> 2865.81
electrical connection you know like a

2860.65 --> 2869.17
spark that can't manifest in a vacuum in

2865.81 --> 2871.63
a vacuum tube house electricity gonna be

2869.17 --> 2873.4900000000002
in that vacuum of the tube it's not

2871.63 --> 2878.4700000000003
gonna be it's gonna go through the tube

2873.49 --> 2880.12
of course pass the tube maybe it's not

2878.47 --> 2883.0
gonna go through the vacuum that doesn't

2880.12 --> 2887.35
make any sense what is it gonna conduct

2883.0 --> 2890.44
through well not the least amount of

2887.35 --> 2894.88
molecules around of course it's gonna

2890.44 --> 2897.21
try to find the best chain it can pass

2894.88 --> 2897.21
through

2905.83 --> 2910.96
right yeah electrostatic potential

2908.64 --> 2913.9
indeed but that is kind of like

2910.96 --> 2917.77
magnetism falls in this it's a field

2913.9 --> 2920.17
right so that can go through a vacuum

2917.77 --> 2924.19
definitely but that's not the same thing

2920.17 --> 2927.67
as an actual electrical connection you

2924.19 --> 2931.8
know as like a spark it's not the same

2927.67 --> 2931.8
effect it's the other side of the coin

2955.859 --> 2965.999
that you write so even you just sing

2962.069 --> 2969.119
that there stone monkey 3d cathode ray

2965.999 --> 2972.72
tubes electrons emitted from begun at

2969.119 --> 2976.4990000000003
the rear and hit the phosphor screen at

2972.72 --> 2984.2889999999998
the front like how what is it what is

2976.499 --> 2987.39
that device how is an electron fired the

2984.289 --> 2990.69
electricity is not loose part that

2987.39 --> 2993.6189999999997
doesn't make any sense how can you fire

2990.69 --> 2993.619
an electron

2999.96 --> 3006.38
I've heard the claims but how is that an

3003.5 --> 3008.69
electron it doesn't make any sense to me

3006.38 --> 3010.6600000000003
how can you fire a separate electron

3008.69 --> 3014.27
that's not how electricity works

3010.66 --> 3017.54
electricity is a tension field then a

3014.27 --> 3019.91
connection then attention relief how can

3017.54 --> 3022.48
you fire a single electron that doesn't

3019.91 --> 3033.04
make any sense

3022.48 --> 3037.4
not to me and how would that work I just

3033.04 --> 3043.07
how can a device fire an electron like

3037.4 --> 3045.59
it is a piece of matter that's not how

3043.07 --> 3048.44
electricity works not in an electrical

3045.59 --> 3051.58
field kind of way in a magnetic or

3048.44 --> 3054.08
electrostatic field and not in a

3051.58 --> 3058.34
attention relieving connection kind of

3054.08 --> 3065.17
way either so how is that electron being

3058.34 --> 3065.17
fired related I don't get it

3069.45 --> 3078.5589999999997
what did they do is it an electron or

3073.77 --> 3081.72
did they just force a very specific

3078.559 --> 3084.599
connection somehow with a very minimum

3081.72 --> 3087.24
charge that is because of the frequency

3084.599 --> 3091.65
was able to spark mean probably

3087.24 --> 3097.7099999999996
invisibly so is that what it is that

3091.65 --> 3099.96
they just spark a connection because an

3097.71 --> 3107.54
electron being a fire does a projectile

3099.96 --> 3107.54
that just it's it seems wrong it

3118.5 --> 3122.06
old-style TVs

3123.54 --> 3133.22
but did they fire electrons at tubes or

3129.11 --> 3137.75
did they just unleash charges of

3133.22 --> 3137.75
electricity on the tubes

3152.109 --> 3160.029
yeah it works what yeah what is it what

3155.349 --> 3162.88
works what is it they actually do okay

3160.029 --> 3166.449
I'm hearing description so how how is

3162.88 --> 3170.17
that possible have you ever dealt with

3166.449 --> 3172.599
electricity and a setup would be doing

3170.17 --> 3174.7290000000003
that how does that work

3172.599 --> 3180.779
what are the conditions for that to be

3174.729 --> 3188.859
possible even electrons guide so

3180.779 --> 3195.429
electrons guided by magnets so there is

3188.859 --> 3198.13
a charge that how is that electrons

3195.429 --> 3202.2690000000002
that's just charged that's charged being

3198.13 --> 3207.2490000000003
I guess guided by magnetic fields in a

3202.269 --> 3211.0589999999997
certain way and bent probably to create

3207.249 --> 3215.009
direction but how is that an electron

3211.059 --> 3215.009
particle it's just

3228.65 --> 3241.3
is a beam of electrons so it's

3235.3 --> 3244.21
electricity it's carefully directed

3241.3 --> 3246.98
electricity so it's the direction

3244.21 --> 3250.91
forcing the direction which the

3246.98 --> 3254.35
connection of the tension that causes

3250.91 --> 3257.8999999999996
the spark basically it is the

3254.35 --> 3262.2799999999997
maneuvering of where that specific spark

3257.9 --> 3267.44
will go that seems to be what that

3262.28 --> 3272.05
describes electrons however I don't see

3267.44 --> 3277.7200000000003
how that relates to a a particle

3272.05 --> 3280.69
understood to be an electron being

3277.72 --> 3284.7999999999997
displaced and moving a trajectory

3280.69 --> 3284.8
separately I don't see that

3288.92 --> 3293.9700000000003
you do you see my dilemma the dilemma

3292.02 --> 3295.77
that I'm trying to point that because

3293.97 --> 3297.99
I'm not saying that that technology

3295.77 --> 3300.09
doesn't exist I'm just saying it's

3297.99 --> 3301.8799999999997
probably misunderstood what's going on

3300.09 --> 3306.27
it's just explained through these

3301.88 --> 3309.8
particle mindset that's the cover story

3306.27 --> 3309.8
it seems to me

3333.95 --> 3341.31
okay we're getting electronic talks now

3337.31 --> 3345.2999999999997
interesting now I do find that these

3341.31 --> 3347.43
type of technical applications of things

3345.3 --> 3351.3300000000004
like electricity and light I do find it

3347.43 --> 3354.6
very fascinating it is pretty ingenious

3351.33 --> 3359.58
how how they made all these intricate

3354.6 --> 3364.23
devices with it we're able to digitally

3359.58 --> 3367.68
represent an image for example seems so

3364.23 --> 3369.6
natural now what that's to originally be

3367.68 --> 3371.1699999999996
able to conceptualize that it's quite a

3369.6 --> 3374.2799999999997
puzzle

3371.17 --> 3374.28
[Music]

3380.64 --> 3385.49
yeah yeah goodbye - of tinker

3390.79 --> 3401.86
I definitely do understand stuff okay

3398.37 --> 3404.91
what I'm doing now however and what I've

3401.86 --> 3409.0
kept doing throughout my life is not

3404.91 --> 3412.69
over fill myself with information that I

3409.0 --> 3416.08
couldn't process so that I'd lose track

3412.69 --> 3419.92
in my critical thinking about the whole

3416.08 --> 3422.35
of it the entire body of my knowledge up

3419.92 --> 3426.19
until that point so I've been recycling

3422.35 --> 3429.21
a lot of knowledge most of the time and

3426.19 --> 3434.32
now after all all this time

3429.21 --> 3436.3
finally it's expanding and now I'm able

3434.32 --> 3438.31
to move into this territory where I

3436.3 --> 3441.4
could have done it before and simply not

3438.31 --> 3444.37
been able to manage not really see the

3441.4 --> 3447.88
details that I would need to see that

3444.37 --> 3451.7799999999997
I'm seeing now and now that I'm doing it

3447.88 --> 3456.33
right now I can see it and so I am

3451.78 --> 3456.3300000000004
pointing at the issues every step I go

3457.92 --> 3463.87
because I think that because of

3460.74 --> 3466.8999999999996
misunderstandings and faulty assumptions

3463.87 --> 3470.62
that I blame mostly on Einstein

3466.9 --> 3474.31
mind you that a lot of these technical

3470.62 --> 3476.7999999999997
things should be very easy to understand

3474.31 --> 3479.23
if it wasn't so convoluted with all this

3476.8 --> 3483.1000000000004
pseudo intellectual nonsense

3479.23 --> 3485.86
and cover stories because they make it

3483.1 --> 3490.29
more difficult more difficult than it

3485.86 --> 3494.3700000000003
needs to be for it to be understood and

3490.29 --> 3494.37
that is part of what I'm doing

3497.249 --> 3507.8999999999996
by moving the bar off the knowledge

3501.729 --> 3507.8999999999996
itself to make it more attainable

3512.48 --> 3516.609
for myself and for others

3529.11 --> 3533.92
but anyway it's interesting I'd yeah

3532.36 --> 3536.29
maybe it would be good to have a

3533.92 --> 3538.0
conversation I'm who knows maybe even

3536.29 --> 3542.2599999999998
with the baller I wouldn't mind too much

3538.0 --> 3545.29
you know about this how this tube works

3542.26 --> 3548.26
how these while presupposed electrons

3545.29 --> 3553.65
are being fired through the vacuum tube

3548.26 --> 3555.82
and then magnetics used to direct it I

3553.65 --> 3557.9500000000003
would it would be interesting to look

3555.82 --> 3560.9500000000003
through technical schematics of how that

3557.95 --> 3563.7
is supposed to work and talk about what

3560.95 --> 3566.77
is actually happening there because

3563.7 --> 3568.33
there is definitely something happening

3566.77 --> 3571.33
there because there's a device that is

3568.33 --> 3573.49
doing that and then just see what are

3571.33 --> 3577.87
the different ways you can conceptually

3573.49 --> 3580.45
approach what's going on there and maybe

3577.87 --> 3583.24
we'll find some new interesting details

3580.45 --> 3587.49
of what could actually be going on in

3583.24 --> 3590.3799999999997
that device you know that is its

3587.49 --> 3596.5299999999997
exploration scientific exploration of

3590.38 --> 3600.69
technology itself to me because I think

3596.53 --> 3604.42
that people bump into things sometimes

3600.69 --> 3609.91
that they presume works according to

3604.42 --> 3612.9700000000003
certain theories it kind of matches but

3609.91 --> 3616.81
that in reality might not work out

3612.97 --> 3622.33
because of what they thought it just

3616.81 --> 3624.85
happens to match and there could be many

3622.33 --> 3627.88
of these type of things integrated even

3624.85 --> 3631.12
in technology where it is presumed to

3627.88 --> 3634.06
work in a certain way and the technology

3631.12 --> 3637.5699999999997
itself does definitely function seems to

3634.06 --> 3642.46
function as predicted but is it actually

3637.57 --> 3645.27
doing what they say it is or is it the

3642.46 --> 3647.2
explanation of it infested with weird

3645.27 --> 3652.71
presupposition and Einstein Ian's

3647.2 --> 3652.71
thinking so let's rediscover

3654.23 --> 3664.619
that's what I love to do dig it all

3658.589 --> 3667.95
through with the a giant intellectually

3664.619 --> 3671.82
honest critical thinking SIF sift

3667.95 --> 3681.21
through all of it all of it everything

3671.82 --> 3686.55
and hey look if technology works it

3681.21 --> 3690.42
works so it's not like oh we figured out

3686.55 --> 3695.2200000000003
- wait why the explanation is wrong so

3690.42 --> 3697.14
now we can't use the device anymore no

3695.22 --> 3700.589
no of course not the device is working

3697.14 --> 3703.52
as it is being used so that that's not

3700.589 --> 3707.49
really gonna change it's just the way

3703.52 --> 3712.52
you realize as to what is actually

3707.49 --> 3712.52
happening in the device that is it

3717.6 --> 3721.0
now I'm not stuck in a loop the

3719.68 --> 3724.0899999999997
collector not at all

3721.0 --> 3727.75
and I've only recently started to delve

3724.09 --> 3732.7200000000003
into this approach I've adapted that

3727.75 --> 3735.7
technique to the the cosmo genie lore

3732.72 --> 3738.79
I've been doing this what I'm basically

3735.7 --> 3743.1699999999996
describing I'm doing that exactly to all

3738.79 --> 3745.45
Cosmo Ginny lore and I have my

3743.17 --> 3748.78
explanations and interpretations and

3745.45 --> 3752.3199999999997
ideas and my model as a result of it and

3748.78 --> 3754.3900000000003
I'm very specific and correct about what

3752.32 --> 3756.94
our presuppositions and how those

3754.39 --> 3758.98
presuppositions are structured within

3756.94 --> 3763.39
all the possibilities and all the things

3758.98 --> 3766.6
that people have thought about how the

3763.39 --> 3770.77
shape our realm and I know she how our

3766.6 --> 3772.81
realm could be designed and I'm very

3770.77 --> 3775.72
aware of it I already adapted my

3772.81 --> 3779.89
technique that I just described to all

3775.72 --> 3782.89
of that and now I'm gonna move on so

3779.89 --> 3786.22
let's get let's get technical get

3782.89 --> 3788.44
technological let's refigure out what's

3786.22 --> 3792.16
going on in the technology isn't that

3788.44 --> 3794.2000000000003
really interesting to do have you ever

3792.16 --> 3797.92
even considered that like you have a

3794.2 --> 3799.8399999999997
device and then you could look up all

3797.92 --> 3801.9700000000003
the details of the device and

3799.84 --> 3804.2400000000002
electronics and specific chips and

3801.97 --> 3808.48
Bligh's endless amount of stuff there

3804.24 --> 3811.5699999999997
but well there could be parts in it that

3808.48 --> 3815.98
when you look in the explanation and you

3811.57 --> 3819.3300000000004
start to think like okay the the effects

3815.98 --> 3823.7400000000002
the result match but does that

3819.33 --> 3823.74
description actually make sense

3825.27 --> 3833.31
isn't that interesting that's it look

3830.28 --> 3835.5600000000004
critical-thinking everything we have

3833.31 --> 3838.7599999999998
been taught could be polluted in some

3835.56 --> 3843.06
way with pseudo-scientific thinking

3838.76 --> 3845.73
because is it gonna matter if half

3843.06 --> 3848.91
society is running on illusions anyway

3845.73 --> 3853.5
it really all comes down to does the

3848.91 --> 3857.19
device function as it is said to be

3853.5 --> 3858.93
supposed to be functioning that is it so

3857.19 --> 3861.18
that's in reality the only thing that's

3858.93 --> 3865.43
gonna have any kind of response whether

3861.18 --> 3865.43
it functions or not not how it works

3866.78 --> 3872.4300000000003
right you don't need to know how your

3870.03 --> 3872.9100000000003
freaking iPhone what is going on in

3872.43 --> 3875.3999999999996
there

3872.91 --> 3879.0
it could take a lifetime to to

3875.4 --> 3883.28
understand that so nobody cares about

3879.0 --> 3883.28
that anymore it's too complicated anyway

3883.61 --> 3894.27
but yeah what are they using what is

3888.03 --> 3896.0400000000004
really going on anyway yeah I'm gonna

3894.27 --> 3900.57
round out the show the Bates have

3896.04 --> 3903.36
already started up and I hope I gave you

3900.57 --> 3905.8500000000004
all some food for thought and a

3903.36 --> 3909.42
direction as to where I could be going

3905.85 --> 3912.0299999999997
and it would be cool to have more people

3909.42 --> 3914.81
that really like or have some knowledge

3912.03 --> 3917.46
to some degree about electronics and

3914.81 --> 3919.89
electronic devices the the really the

3917.46 --> 3921.96
more old basics would be a would be

3919.89 --> 3924.24
great well most people that are into

3921.96 --> 3926.37
electronics know the basics that's like

3924.24 --> 3931.14
the first thing you study when you go

3926.37 --> 3935.43
for that and let's see what what we can

3931.14 --> 3937.56
dig up with the combined knowledge of us

3935.43 --> 3939.93
all together it could be really

3937.56 --> 3941.64
interesting and at in the state at the

3939.93 --> 3944.6099999999997
same time I'm still gonna pursue my

3941.64 --> 3947.5499999999997
quantum mechanics studies hopefully

3944.61 --> 3949.7400000000002
it'll be a little bit colder a little

3947.55 --> 3951.3
bit fresher out there so I'll be more

3949.74 --> 3955.2599999999998
able to concentrate because with this

3951.3 --> 3958.599
heat it's just really tough but I will

3955.26 --> 3961.76
definitely keep on working until I am

3958.599 --> 3964.329
satisfied that I could say yeah I've

3961.76 --> 3968.0
studied quantum mechanics and I get it

3964.329 --> 3969.8590000000004
get it to my satisfaction and enough to

3968.0 --> 3971.99
be able to have conversations with

3969.859 --> 3974.75
quantum mechanics and literally

3971.99 --> 3977.24
understand everything they're saying not

3974.75 --> 3979.46
necessarily knowing every detail but at

3977.24 --> 3982.339
least being able to perfectly understand

3979.46 --> 3985.19
what they're talking about to understand

3982.339 --> 3987.8289999999997
what this is they're actually doing that

3985.19 --> 3990.23
is what I want to have certainty of at

3987.829 --> 3996.069
the end of the trip concerning quantum

3990.23 --> 3997.819
mechanics so anyway thanks everything oh

3996.069 --> 3999.859
yes I can

3997.819 --> 4004.2599999999998
conspiracy cats thanks for reaffirming

3999.859 --> 4008.71
that right so thanks everyone for coming

4004.26 --> 4011.17
I hope you enjoyed the show if you did

4027.22 --> 4032.2
gonna go to the Flat Earth debates after

4029.859 --> 4032.65
this and I will be back tomorrow with
