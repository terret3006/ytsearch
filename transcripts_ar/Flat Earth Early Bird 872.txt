right

139.92 --> 147.2
so it's friday the 23rd

143.44 --> 147.2
of april 2021

150.82 --> 156.48
[Music]

153.76 --> 159.12
surprise surprise i completely forgot to

156.48 --> 159.11999999999998
make notes

166.16 --> 171.84
let me update it

174.959 --> 188.48000000000002
let's see

185.2 --> 191.83999999999997
right so yeah yesterday's

188.48 --> 191.84
flat earth early bird show

196.319 --> 201.44
like the first part pretty much was a

198.159 --> 204.64
disaster i felt really shitty

201.44 --> 208.0
and i think that

204.64 --> 208.0
definitely came out

208.319 --> 217.44
so trolls

212.08 --> 223.59900000000002
were all over me or rather that troll

217.44 --> 223.599
and yeah i didn't handle that well

225.92 --> 230.39999999999998
but yeah it was basically recovering

228.4 --> 233.28
from this

230.4 --> 235.68
alcohol situation uh so yeah i

233.28 --> 240.159
definitely fixed that

235.68 --> 242.799
and i did sleep a lot better

240.159 --> 242.79899999999998
this night

243.599 --> 249.28
and yeah definitely do feel a little

246.319 --> 249.28
more cleared up

250.159 --> 252.4
but

253.519 --> 261.44
yeah today like it's it's another one of

257.44 --> 261.44
those days where just things go wrong

262.96 --> 269.84
cut myself

270.16 --> 274.86
by accident by the way

271.71 --> 274.85999999999996
[Music]

279.199 --> 284.40000000000003
and when i tried to get a band-aid from

281.44 --> 287.04
my roommate he basically left me hanging

284.4 --> 288.96
because he was on the phone like like

287.04 --> 290.96000000000004
what the hell

288.96 --> 294.08
but i got my own band-aids now so that's

290.96 --> 294.08
never gonna happen again

295.6 --> 300.24
although yeah i'm not really putting a

297.36 --> 304.08000000000004
band-aid on it anymore

300.24 --> 304.08
it seemed to have just kind of like

305.44 --> 312.71999999999997
yeah just stopped bleeding and

309.12 --> 312.72
it's kind of superficial but

312.8 --> 317.6
whatever i already did groceries so i'm

316.479 --> 325.84
not going out

317.6 --> 325.84000000000003
anymore hello ralph rodriguez

326.96 --> 329.35999999999996
all right

336.0 --> 339.84
uh oh yeah

342.56 --> 350.32
yesterday yeah the flat earth debates

347.199 --> 353.759
were fine i was not really active at

350.32 --> 357.68
all and yeah people were just very

353.759 --> 360.40000000000003
much trying to dominate there and i

357.68 --> 360.8
yeah i didn't feel really any strength

360.4 --> 363.37
or

360.8 --> 364.88
urge to get in between that

363.37 --> 368.08
[Music]

364.88 --> 371.919
later also owen benjamin went live again

368.08 --> 371.919
with gary and terry good stuff

372.479 --> 374.8
uh

375.919 --> 381.84
that's about it i think

383.199 --> 389.44
let's see right there is the

386.639 --> 389.44
new movie

390.639 --> 396.24
samson posted that in the early bird

393.84 --> 400.15999999999997
i basically heard it yeah that's right i

396.24 --> 400.16
heard it through 24 7 discord

402.72 --> 409.84000000000003
there's this new movie called level

419.28 --> 426.79999999999995
let me see

423.84 --> 429.039
if you haven't taken notice of that yet

426.8 --> 432.479
i will post

429.039 --> 437.84
the link to the video

432.479 --> 437.84
hold on where is it

446.319 --> 453.84000000000003
and yeah take i took a look

450.479 --> 453.84
it's pretty decent

453.919 --> 460.0
just in the start there was like a minor

457.52 --> 461.44
issue but that's just something so

460.0 --> 463.28
typical

461.44 --> 464.639
it's like that's never gonna go away i

463.28 --> 466.96
think

464.639 --> 468.40000000000003
right there was a suggestion that the

466.96 --> 471.35999999999996
sun

468.4 --> 472.23999999999995
moves into the distance and becomes

471.36 --> 474.47900000000004
smaller

472.24 --> 477.28000000000003
due to perspective and it moving away

474.479 --> 479.84
when basically the angular speed is not

477.28 --> 479.84
changed

480.879 --> 487.03900000000004
other than that it was pretty good even

484.0 --> 490.24
i had relative density

487.039 --> 493.36
within it and yeah it was

490.24 --> 496.96000000000004
nicely edited with

493.36 --> 496.96000000000004
familiar faces in there

498.8 --> 505.44
yeah overall just a pretty good

502.0 --> 505.44
flat earth documentary

505.68 --> 510.0
so yeah definitely not some kind of

508.639 --> 513.919
controlled opposition

510.0 --> 516.56
piece or like heavily edited

513.919 --> 518.959
like beyond the curve was it was just a

516.56 --> 523.1999999999999
pretty good documentary

518.959 --> 526.56
i'm glad that it turned out pretty cool

523.2 --> 527.839
so anybody else saw that anyway the link

526.56 --> 535.8389999999999
is in the chat

527.839 --> 535.839
so take a look if you haven't already

546.16 --> 553.76
all right so anyway friday

549.2 --> 556.0
ah hello cameron kamikaze gilmore

553.76 --> 557.76
good to see you in chat hope some more

556.0 --> 563.839
we'll get in

557.76 --> 567.68
we can have some conversations going

563.839 --> 567.6800000000001
because i could use some distractions

567.92 --> 571.36
because i'm not really feeling all that

569.839 --> 573.7600000000001
great right now

571.36 --> 575.44
not because of alcohol but because of

573.76 --> 577.279
everything else

575.44 --> 579.2790000000001
it's just one of those days where the

577.279 --> 583.4399999999999
tension seems to gather despite the

579.279 --> 583.4399999999999
great weather i'm just not feeling great

586.72 --> 594.08
but i'm going to trust that that's just

590.32 --> 597.6
temporary and due to building tensions

594.08 --> 597.6
my landlord situation

599.6 --> 605.839
because i got a bit of disappointment

602.88 --> 605.8389999999999
like i thought

606.56 --> 609.68
i had a bit of an understanding like

608.64 --> 612.72
with my

609.68 --> 619.8389999999999
roommates but yeah the new guy

612.72 --> 619.839
he basically chickened out

620.8 --> 624.959
which just like that's a serious

624.0 --> 628.24
disappointment

624.959 --> 631.1999999999999
like so

628.24 --> 632.88
yeah apparently i gotta try the other

631.2 --> 633.36
guy though but i don't know if he's

632.88 --> 636.079
gonna

633.36 --> 637.36
do the same thing or anything it's just

636.079 --> 640.88
that

637.36 --> 641.36
i thought that i yeah i've been doing my

640.88 --> 646.399
best

641.36 --> 649.04
a lot recently just to be

646.399 --> 650.64
the best i could be and that's supposed

649.04 --> 653.36
to be standard i know

650.64 --> 653.8389999999999
and i'm doing that but apparently

653.36 --> 658.8000000000001
they're

653.839 --> 661.44
kind of like intimidated by my landlord

658.8 --> 663.76
and they don't want to get in trouble

661.44 --> 666.9590000000001
right even though i'm not even asking to

663.76 --> 668.959
address anything just like

666.959 --> 670.8
basically give testify to my good

668.959 --> 674.399
behavior

670.8 --> 676.3199999999999
that's it so

674.399 --> 678.88
yeah that that was basically a major

676.32 --> 682.1600000000001
bummer and that rises the tension

678.88 --> 685.279
for me i've been yeah

682.16 --> 688.0
like i'm now already looking around

685.279 --> 688.72
for other places and it's extremely

688.0 --> 690.8
tough

688.72 --> 691.76
everything that i've bumped into so far

690.8 --> 695.68
is like

691.76 --> 695.68
pretty bad alternatives

696.079 --> 700.3199999999999
but yeah i need some help looking for a

698.8 --> 702.7199999999999
new place

700.32 --> 703.6
because i do feel like this is just not

702.72 --> 706.399
gonna last

703.6 --> 706.88
like i might i'll probably just get

706.399 --> 710.48
through

706.88 --> 713.12
this this situation

710.48 --> 713.839
but this is just not this is not a way

713.12 --> 717.519
to live

713.839 --> 719.9200000000001
in a place where literally the one

717.519 --> 721.2
who owns the house is kind of obsessed

719.92 --> 724.7199999999999
to get you out and

721.2 --> 725.9200000000001
literally conspires and creates rumors

724.72 --> 729.279
behind your back

725.92 --> 732.639
with everybody like this is

729.279 --> 734.32
like i i can't this is not a durable

732.639 --> 738.16
situation for me

734.32 --> 738.1600000000001
but yeah where where will i go

739.04 --> 742.399
so i i wish

740.95 --> 746.0790000000001
[Music]

742.399 --> 749.6
i could get some help finding a viable

746.079 --> 749.5999999999999
new living situation

750.079 --> 752.6389999999999
somehow

757.76 --> 765.04
right so but

762.0 --> 767.2
yeah maybe i'll just feel better soon

765.04 --> 767.1999999999999
and

768.0 --> 774.399
i can leave all this worries

771.44 --> 774.399
behind me again

774.88 --> 779.6
keep on going with the show doing what i

777.44 --> 779.6
do

780.399 --> 785.68
and not yeah not get bogged down or

783.44 --> 787.9200000000001
anything

785.68 --> 787.92
all right

802.48 --> 807.6800000000001
what okay

805.519 --> 809.04
we are eagles how's that for an early

807.68 --> 815.8389999999999
bird

809.04 --> 815.8389999999999
no need to get offended what

826.15 --> 829.23
[Music]

836.079 --> 842.4799999999999
right so anyway i'm yeah i'm up for

839.68 --> 844.959
whatever questions you want me to

842.48 --> 848.0790000000001
address something

844.959 --> 852.4799999999999
want to share something yeah anything

848.079 --> 855.04
so i got over one and a half hour

852.48 --> 856.16
at least hey stopping traffic in my rest

855.04 --> 858.48
i had

856.16 --> 858.48
sup

867.76 --> 885.8389999999999
you up early are you up really late

889.6 --> 899.839
late all right well then you're up

893.12 --> 899.839
really late

906.56 --> 927.8389999999999
fitness at night okay

912.079 --> 927.8389999999999
are you restless or something

930.32 --> 935.36
right yeah one little thingy i guess

935.68 --> 941.5999999999999
like when i went to my social worker

937.44 --> 945.12
yesterday better weather uh good to hear

941.6 --> 948.24
is that he is going that guy

945.12 --> 950.39
specifically with like he's now

948.24 --> 953.04
fully anti-mask

950.39 --> 956.079
[Music]

953.04 --> 957.36
like like not even wearing a mask yeah

956.079 --> 959.92
where he works

957.36 --> 962.48
technically he wouldn't have to but he

959.92 --> 964.7199999999999
is kind of complaining like me so it's

962.48 --> 966.16
it's kind of odd to see that my social

964.72 --> 968.88
worker

966.16 --> 971.12
in this in a way is like in a similar

968.88 --> 975.279
position as i am

971.12 --> 977.04
but yeah as a social worker

975.279 --> 979.04
because he's really doing his best to

977.04 --> 982.16
kind of to

979.04 --> 986.7199999999999
to stop the corona measures very

982.16 --> 989.199
active with the protest movements

986.72 --> 992.72
like he's really onto it like he goes

989.199 --> 996.24
there like almost every weekend

992.72 --> 996.9590000000001
where i basically just sit tight over

996.24 --> 1000.639
here

996.959 --> 1003.7589999999999
not really get out there in a way i wish

1000.639 --> 1005.759
i would it's just that

1003.759 --> 1006.88
the extra traveling cost and all that

1005.759 --> 1011.1990000000001
extra time

1006.88 --> 1014.959
it's not really

1011.199 --> 1014.959
something i feel i can't afford

1019.759 --> 1025.839
hello dean wright morning to you too

1048.72 --> 1053.2
right but yeah he's kind of in that

1050.88 --> 1053.919
position and i'm starting to notice now

1053.2 --> 1058.4
that there's

1053.919 --> 1061.76
more people out there going about

1058.4 --> 1061.76
just not wearing a mask

1062.4 --> 1067.6000000000001
but it's it seemed to be not so much the

1065.679 --> 1071.1200000000001
younger people as it is

1067.6 --> 1074.7199999999998
the well mid-age

1071.12 --> 1077.36
to little older people some of them are

1074.72 --> 1079.039
seemingly just going about not wearing a

1077.36 --> 1083.4399999999998
mask

1079.039 --> 1086.4
where before it really for a time

1083.44 --> 1087.44
it just went kind of up and down or

1086.4 --> 1089.3600000000001
first is like

1087.44 --> 1090.799
half the people wearing masks and then

1089.36 --> 1094.799
suddenly

1090.799 --> 1098.4
after a while for a couple of months

1094.799 --> 1100.4
like it even increased again

1098.4 --> 1104.16
it's it's weird it's just the whole

1100.4 --> 1104.16
dynamics of it is not what i

1106.84 --> 1110.799
expected

1108.559 --> 1112.8799999999999
people have really let themselves get

1110.799 --> 1114.0
conditioned to just wear it all the time

1112.88 --> 1118.0
like even when they

1114.0 --> 1118.0
even when they go out sporting it's

1120.84 --> 1124.6399999999999
ridiculous

through the train system then i'd have

1149.76 --> 1156.32
to wear a mask too i think or well

1152.16 --> 1156.3200000000002
no i i'd have it

right nothing really stood out

1330.84 --> 1333.84
okay

1378.96 --> 1382.64
right oh yeah there was like this weird

1381.039 --> 1385.36
piece

1382.64 --> 1387.1200000000001
over at infowars with lack of other

1385.36 --> 1390.6399999999999

where you got the uh is it like

1390.64 --> 1397.2
greer this uh ufo

1394.64 --> 1398.88
aliens guy that was like that's been

1397.2 --> 1400.48
trying to declassify

1398.88 --> 1402.96
the contact with aliens of the

1400.48 --> 1405.6
government for like a long time

1402.96 --> 1407.8400000000001
it's been at it for decades remember him

1405.6 --> 1409.9189999999999
from way back

1407.84 --> 1412.24
so he was on there this really seems to

1409.919 --> 1413.76
be like a new subject of red infowars

1412.24 --> 1415.44
where they're talking about oh there's

1413.76 --> 1418.8799999999999
increased

1415.44 --> 1422.88
like ufo technology that's gonna be

1418.88 --> 1425.44
applied and all that

1422.88 --> 1426.4
so yeah didn't really pay too close

1425.44 --> 1428.88
attention

1426.4 --> 1430.96
in ways i've already heard about this

1428.88 --> 1434.0
just not through infowars

1430.96 --> 1434.0
a long time ago

1434.32 --> 1438.24
but yeah whatever that happened

1442.84 --> 1449.52
okay

1445.679 --> 1452.3200000000002
well says dr oszell

1449.52 --> 1452.32
never heard of him

1456.84 --> 1459.84
really

1468.159 --> 1475.44
actually curing that are you sure

1472.159 --> 1478.64
how does that work i mean

1475.44 --> 1480.88
i know you can basically ensure that it

1478.64 --> 1482.96
just never comes out again but really

1480.88 --> 1487.8400000000001
curing it

1482.96 --> 1487.8400000000001
are you sure

got buried in the ground and they came

okay that's one way of describing it

1624.84 --> 1627.84
right

1628.799 --> 1635.6
yeah it's weird man like

1631.84 --> 1639.279
i didn't expect this dynamic

1635.6 --> 1644.32
this situation with

1639.279 --> 1648.96
nathan and crew which i am a part of

1644.32 --> 1654.48
that it becomes so polarized

1648.96 --> 1656.96
from the outside like

1654.48 --> 1658.48
nathan in many ways is just kind of like

1656.96 --> 1661.6000000000001
seems to be

1671.919 --> 1675.44
yeah it's a good setup the housekeeping

questions

1675.44 --> 1677.919
everything

and like going at it with

1682.0 --> 1688.88
like serious serious baller zealots

1686.48 --> 1691.039
like where else does that happen in an

1691.039 --> 1697.52

kind of stumbling

1697.52 --> 1701.9189999999999

ranty is doing

1723.6 --> 1731.36
i i i can't tell anymore

1727.279 --> 1731.36
i haven't really heard anything of him

1733.84 --> 1739.4399999999998
i mean i hear that he claimed that

1736.88 --> 1741.0390000000002
that one picture was kind of proof that

1739.44 --> 1743.039
might be a ball

1741.039 --> 1745.6
or a bigger ball all that i haven't

1743.039 --> 1748.559
heard any of those words actually

1745.6 --> 1750.48
directly from him so i don't know what

1748.559 --> 1753.84
he's doing

1750.48 --> 1753.84
i just don't know

1767.12 --> 1770.559
what elo gaining wisdom

1774.72 --> 1780.3990000000001
by your time here was six years old in

1777.039 --> 1781.679
the late 70s most kids knew when you saw

1780.399 --> 1784.9599999999998
another kid equal to

1781.679 --> 1787.76
h equaling age acting

1784.96 --> 1787.76

a republic outside at the park i knew to

1795.52 --> 1798.72
wait

1796.0 --> 1809.84
for the rod and more i don't know what

1798.72 --> 1809.84
that means getting wisdom

1834.08 --> 1841.6789999999999
he claims flat shoaling water near land

1838.72 --> 1842.64
does he do that now because randy had

1841.679 --> 1845.919
been doing like

1842.64 --> 1845.919
pieces on shaolin

1846.559 --> 1850.08
like a year ago or something i don't

1848.32 --> 1865.84
know is it it's

1850.08 --> 1865.84
some time ago

1870.72 --> 1879.84

1872.88 --> 1879.8400000000001
know what you're talking about

1881.76 --> 1886.1589999999999
don't know what ocs stands for also

1888.96 --> 1892.159
but no it's a globe right well whatever

1891.279 --> 1894.32
man

1892.159 --> 1894.3200000000002
look

1895.2 --> 1900.559
to me it's it's kind of blatantly

1897.919 --> 1903.679
obvious that ranty is just

1900.559 --> 1906.8799999999999
flipping his own script and playing

1903.679 --> 1911.919
he's just playing with the ballers and

1906.88 --> 1916.48
everybody getting attention and it works

1911.919 --> 1916.48
right it always works on the short run

1916.799 --> 1923.279
but like

1920.08 --> 1924.8799999999999
either there's only really so many

1923.279 --> 1927.519
options right when you do that

1924.88 --> 1928.72
either he's basically abandoned flat

1927.519 --> 1934.159
earth for

1928.72 --> 1935.84
i don't know societal tactical reasons

1934.159 --> 1938.64
maybe he's getting some money out of it

1935.84 --> 1941.279
i don't know maybe that's the plan

1938.64 --> 1942.5590000000002
or he's just trolling and he's just

1941.279 --> 1946.08
playing

1942.559 --> 1949.12
acting oh yeah i'm a glober now

1946.08 --> 1951.039
and then switch back again

1949.12 --> 1953.5189999999998
when i don't know he feels it's the

1951.039 --> 1955.519
right moment to do that

1953.519 --> 1958.24
i wouldn't be surprised one bit that's

1955.519 --> 1960.84
why i i just don't really care

1958.24 --> 1963.84
about where he stands it's all

2102.96 --> 2107.44
even say about randy at this point

2105.2 --> 2108.3999999999996
you know like he's just doing whatever

2107.44 --> 2110.56
he wants to do

and

2112.24 --> 2117.839
i'm not getting all upset by it i was

2114.56 --> 2120.88
upset with him a long time ago

2117.839 --> 2126.4
and after that point i really cut off

2120.88 --> 2126.4
just my care for anything concerning him

2126.48 --> 2132.64
and whatever man he might be

2129.599 --> 2134.079
grabbing for fame or something bigger or

2132.64 --> 2137.2
whatever maybe he's gonna

2134.079 --> 2141.44
try to create like his own entire group

2348.96 --> 2353.44
was like the baller that would never

talk about the ball that would always

2353.44 --> 2356.8

start bringing up trivial non-related

2388.32 --> 2392.96
he's always talking about having cakes

and all that

2392.96 --> 2401.119
and pies

2433.599 --> 2438.0
this is weird all this yawning from my

2435.839 --> 2440.0789999999997
side what it is is it's not because i'm

2438.0 --> 2443.28
tired it's because in a way i'm like

2440.079 --> 2443.28
emotionally stressed

2443.76 --> 2447.76
i'm not planning to express that because

2446.16 --> 2450.0789999999997
it's it doesn't work

2447.76 --> 2453.119
but then the tension has to go somewhere

2450.079 --> 2455.599
so that's causing me to yawn i think

2453.119 --> 2456.1600000000003
because guys i'm not really feeling good

2455.599 --> 2466.2400000000002

2489.839 --> 2494.0789999999997
when i'm strong it radiates off me and

2493.119 --> 2497.119
everything always

2494.079 --> 2500.2400000000002
works right everything i do

2497.119 --> 2503.359
like people appreciate me

2500.24 --> 2503.68
like really work with me when i'm like

2503.359 --> 2506.96

2506.96 --> 2512.56

2512.56 --> 2517.599
like the ultimate moment where i

2514.88 --> 2518.4
i need anything but specifically that

2517.599 --> 2520.96
and that's what

2518.4 --> 2523.839
everyone does then and there's nothing i

2520.96 --> 2523.839
can do about it

2573.119 --> 2577.28
because he hung around there a lot so he

2575.28 --> 2579.8390000000004
would know

2577.28 --> 2579.8390000000004
that's weird

2588.0 --> 2593.839
okay well tiny womble yeah maybe

2591.2 --> 2596.3999999999996
maybe man i don't know if this is going

2593.839 --> 2600.56
to persist

2596.4 --> 2603.04
maybe good servant is still in the

2600.56 --> 2603.04
hospital

2604.839 --> 2607.839
right

2621.29 --> 2624.329
[Music]

2626.4 --> 2632.48
right but yeah you know obermuco

2629.599 --> 2634.56
might be kind of gone there's still

2632.48 --> 2636.8
plenty of people here

2634.56 --> 2637.839
like i got a lot more people now

2636.8 --> 2640.88
following

2637.839 --> 2644.4
and being in my chat regularly

2640.88 --> 2649.839
than i had during the time yeah during

2644.4 --> 2649.839
last year

2651.92 --> 2655.44
and i'm very hap i'm very happy new

2654.0 --> 2657.599
people

2655.44 --> 2658.96
have found my channel and actually are

2657.599 --> 2662.48
willing to be

2658.96 --> 2676.16
part of it through the chat

2662.48 --> 2677.76
i do feel like in ways i am loved it

2676.16 --> 2680.56
will be out in a week or so yeah that's

2677.76 --> 2680.5600000000004
what he told me

2688.079 --> 2693.28
and i i'm just guys i'm having like

2691.119 --> 2695.599
really serious doubt about like

2693.28 --> 2698.5600000000004
everything i'm doing here

2695.599 --> 2700.6400000000003
where is this gonna lead to what does it

2698.56 --> 2702.4
really mean in the big picture i get the

2700.64 --> 2704.64
feeling that

2702.4 --> 2705.44
as soon as i'm gone it's like everything

2704.64 --> 2709.1189999999997
i'm going

2705.44 --> 2712.48
i have said will just be forgotten

2709.119 --> 2712.48
right now that might be

2714.0 --> 2721.119
an idea based on demoralized

2717.76 --> 2723.2000000000003
perspective i don't know man i just

2721.119 --> 2725.44
sometimes i feel like this sometimes i

2723.2 --> 2725.4399999999996
just

2725.92 --> 2733.28
i don't really like seriously guys

2729.76 --> 2736.88
nathan oakley is the only

2733.28 --> 2737.92
person out there that actually gives me

2736.88 --> 2740.88
credit

2737.92 --> 2741.2000000000003
for some of the things that i do that's

2740.88 --> 2744.839
like

2741.2 --> 2746.0
actually using his platform to to share

2744.839 --> 2751.119
that

2746.0 --> 2753.839
right he's the only one okay

2751.119 --> 2755.119
like the guys mention me sure we're all

2753.839 --> 2757.2
friends and all that

2755.119 --> 2759.44
nathan is the only one that actually

2757.2 --> 2762.56
gives me some freaking credit

2759.44 --> 2765.599
okay now now look at

2762.56 --> 2767.92
at the hundreds of people out there

2765.599 --> 2771.44
right look at their terminologies look

2767.92 --> 2775.839
at everything that's happened so far

2771.44 --> 2775.839
it seems like nobody cares

2776.0 --> 2781.76
they're just they're just taking and

2778.88 --> 2781.76
they don't care

2787.359 --> 2793.2799999999997
like i want to do stuff

2790.72 --> 2793.839
i i would like to join other people's

2793.28 --> 2797.6800000000003
shows

2793.839 --> 2799.04
right and not just a group of debaters

2797.68 --> 2802.8799999999997
going at it because

2799.04 --> 2805.7599999999998
then i'll just be waiting like

2802.88 --> 2806.319
oh yeah when am i gonna be able to say

2805.76 --> 2808.48
anything

2806.319 --> 2809.68
right i might have a moment and then it

2808.48 --> 2811.68
just goes away again

2809.68 --> 2814.24
like and that's fine like on 24 7

2811.68 --> 2818.96
discord it's like this and that's fine

2814.24 --> 2818.9599999999996
that's the dynamic of such a setup

2819.599 --> 2825.2000000000003
but there's so much going on

2822.72 --> 2825.2
out there

2827.44 --> 2833.839
and nobody's contacting me

2831.359 --> 2833.839
nobody

2835.68 --> 2841.9199999999996
i get more messages from

2838.88 --> 2841.92
pure trolls

2843.119 --> 2849.119
and well i do get just like the people

2846.24 --> 2852.8799999999997
that are following here

2849.119 --> 2854.079
and you guys are awesome i really do

2852.88 --> 2856.6400000000003
appreciate that but

2854.079 --> 2858.319
sometimes i feel like why is it just a

2856.64 --> 2861.52
few people

2858.319 --> 2864.8
why is everybody kind of like not

2861.52 --> 2867.04
reaching out what is going on here is it

2864.8 --> 2869.28
because of the situation with the globe

2867.04 --> 2870.96
light or that i rejected because i kind

2869.28 --> 2873.2000000000003
of had a nervous breakdown

2870.96 --> 2874.559
is that just like the test moment and

2873.2 --> 2877.4399999999996
now everybody thinks

2874.559 --> 2880.0
arwen yeah that's really cute he's too

2877.44 --> 2882.2400000000002
[ __ ] weak to do anything

2880.0 --> 2884.24
like you can't do anything with it is

2882.24 --> 2887.7599999999998
that what everybody thinks

2884.24 --> 2889.839
is that what they really think of me

2887.76 --> 2892.4
because of that i get that feeling

2889.839 --> 2893.359
sometimes because i can do stuff i can't

2892.4 --> 2896.4
just

2893.359 --> 2900.16
get on bigger shows i have verbal skills

2896.4 --> 2902.2400000000002
i don't always go in rage win mode right

2900.16 --> 2903.44
i can't keep that under control there's

2902.24 --> 2905.7599999999998
a whole

2903.44 --> 2907.52
range of things that i can do and that i

2905.76 --> 2908.7200000000003
know i have expertise i have good

2907.52 --> 2911.04
willingness

2908.72 --> 2911.04
right

2912.8 --> 2919.2000000000003
you want honesty yes iron 26

2915.92 --> 2919.2000000000003
i want honesty

2919.68 --> 2922.7999999999997
i want honesty

2923.44 --> 2929.839
i want honesty and

2926.64 --> 2929.839
i want honesty

2929.92 --> 2937.44
right because if you're just here

2934.96 --> 2938.319
any of you that are just here to kind of

2937.44 --> 2940.96
like

2938.319 --> 2941.52

2940.96 --> 2944.559
to

2941.52 --> 2946.4
help him stay afloat and that's it and

2944.559 --> 2949.599
that's really it

2946.4 --> 2951.76
just helping out like the poor guy

2949.599 --> 2954.839
that's it if that is it then i don't

2951.76 --> 2957.8390000000004
know what the [ __ ] i'm doing here

2954.839 --> 2957.839
anymore

2968.839 --> 2985.839
ugh

2970.64 --> 2985.839
like do i have value here on the scene

2989.52 --> 2994.96
read all right and what no

2992.64 --> 2996.0789999999997
the best win oh oh you like me when i

2994.96 --> 2999.28
rage oh that's

2996.079 --> 2999.599
oh that's just fantastic yeah it's just

2999.28 --> 3003.52
that

2999.599 --> 3005.76
every [ __ ] time i do it

3003.52 --> 3008.319
it's just like people only take more

3005.76 --> 3008.3190000000004
distance

3009.119 --> 3013.04
like everybody's afraid of me now

3011.359 --> 3016.7999999999997
because i do that

3013.04 --> 3019.92
aries 106 right

3016.8 --> 3020.6400000000003
and some people are like yeah sure we we

3019.92 --> 3023.119
get that

3020.64 --> 3027.839
they make a bit of a joke about it haha

3023.119 --> 3030.7200000000003
funny a rage win and others seem to be

3027.839 --> 3033.119
i don't know maybe by doing that i've

3030.72 --> 3034.0789999999997
crossed the line for a whole range of

3033.119 --> 3036.8
people

3034.079 --> 3038.96
that just think that guy is insane we

3036.8 --> 3039.3590000000004
can never trust him or something like

3038.96 --> 3042.079
that

3039.359 --> 3044.96
i don't know anymore man i don't know i

3042.079 --> 3044.96
just know that

3045.04 --> 3051.68
i wish i had more

3048.64 --> 3053.7599999999998
contacts out there other shows people

3051.68 --> 3055.2799999999997
that would actually say like yeah that's

3053.76 --> 3058.88
a guy that

3055.28 --> 3062.48
that you can get on right

3058.88 --> 3062.48
how many things have i been on

3062.88 --> 3067.6800000000003
i've been on patricia's stairs that was

3065.28 --> 3071.44
pretty awesome

3067.68 --> 3073.9199999999996
i got on like the truth frequency radio

3071.44 --> 3076.16
the iron realm before that all yeah i

3073.92 --> 3079.599
kind of went to [ __ ]

3076.16 --> 3084.72
because of you know what

3079.599 --> 3084.7200000000003
with adam and all that bob

3085.76 --> 3094.1600000000003
i did great i thought i did great

3090.64 --> 3094.16
but maybe

3094.24 --> 3098.5589999999997
maybe it's my my dark world vision stuff

3097.44 --> 3101.2000000000003
or something maybe

3098.559 --> 3102.559
people just really don't know what the

3101.2 --> 3105.04
[ __ ] to do with me

3102.559 --> 3107.44
is that it is that really it i'm just

3105.04 --> 3109.52
completely unapproachable

3107.44 --> 3111.04
it's like there's no way you can blend

3109.52 --> 3113.52
in an r win when you

3111.04 --> 3115.7599999999998
aiming for a bigger audience is that it

3113.52 --> 3119.119
i'd like to hear so

3115.76 --> 3120.48
from real people not [ __ ] trolls i'd

3119.119 --> 3124.079
like to hear that

3120.48 --> 3126.72
if it's the case right

3124.079 --> 3128.4
because i feel like i'm being isolated

3126.72 --> 3139.4199999999996
even on the scene

3128.4 --> 3142.53
right on the scene

3139.42 --> 3142.53
[Music]

3156.11 --> 3161.28
[Music]

3158.88 --> 3163.28
you need my reading skills for the topic

3161.28 --> 3165.6800000000003
well look there's a skype link

3163.28 --> 3167.44

3165.68 --> 3172.72
description box

3167.44 --> 3176.0
below the video add me on skype

3172.72 --> 3181.839
i'm there you want to talk to me

3176.0 --> 3181.839
i'm there talk to me

3188.0 --> 3195.839
what the hell constant chips no i'm not

3190.559 --> 3195.8390000000004
getting a [ __ ] haircut

3204.319 --> 3208.4
well cameron kamikaze gilmore i truly

3207.04 --> 3212.48
appreciate

3208.4 --> 3216.88
that what you're saying but why

3212.48 --> 3219.68
like why is it like 50 people

3216.88 --> 3221.76
of the thousands and thousands and

3219.68 --> 3222.0
thousands of people out there that seem

3221.76 --> 3226.3190000000004
to

3222.0 --> 3226.319
think that and the rest is just ignoring

3234.839 --> 3237.839
me

3246.559 --> 3250.0
right because yeah just for your

3249.2 --> 3252.319
information right

3250.0 --> 3253.44
i'm doing this early bird show thing

3252.319 --> 3256.72
right now

3253.44 --> 3260.319
okay i've been doing it for a long time

3256.72 --> 3261.68
it's just me talking and because i do it

3260.319 --> 3264.319
every day

3261.68 --> 3266.319
yeah it gets a little stale sometimes i

3264.319 --> 3269.68
get a little silent you get to see

3266.319 --> 3272.96
every mood i have and even me

3269.68 --> 3275.68
going over the edge and me going through

3272.96 --> 3279.839
really good concise moments where i put

3275.68 --> 3279.839
down great explanations yeah i know

3280.079 --> 3287.04
if you want me as like a

3284.0 --> 3287.04
side character

3287.2 --> 3295.04
or like an item on a show

3291.28 --> 3297.3590000000004
like any show any show

3295.04 --> 3298.64
that somehow relates the flat earth or

3297.359 --> 3302.24
whatever

3298.64 --> 3306.24
right spiritual subjects

3302.24 --> 3309.359
anything medical sure

3306.24 --> 3312.64
i'm good for it i i'm not

3309.359 --> 3313.44
gonna be like the emo guy that's just

3312.64 --> 3315.7599999999998
coming on

3313.44 --> 3317.839
your show with a specific subject to

3315.76 --> 3318.7990000000004
talk about my feelings or let that get

3317.839 --> 3323.2799999999997
in the way

3318.799 --> 3326.4
no because then i got a mission

3323.28 --> 3330.1600000000003
and i'm going to actually be an expert

3326.4 --> 3334.079
as in that thing that is expected of me

3330.16 --> 3337.44
so if somehow how i live

3334.079 --> 3339.92
my feelings or how i am seems kind of

3337.44 --> 3342.88
like oh no we don't want that

3339.92 --> 3344.16
it's not gonna be that okay if that's

3342.88 --> 3348.1600000000003
not what you want

3344.16 --> 3351.44
that's not what i'm gonna give right

3348.16 --> 3352.319
that only happens as a side effect

3351.44 --> 3355.2000000000003
because i do

3352.319 --> 3357.359
a show every day right how many flat

3355.2 --> 3360.319
earthers do you know out there

3357.359 --> 3361.119
besides nathan oakley and i even trump

3360.319 --> 3364.48
him in that

3361.119 --> 3369.52
that do a show every

3364.48 --> 3369.52
day right how many do you know

3373.76 --> 3378.0
go tell me how many people do you know

3377.44 --> 3391.839
that have

3378.0 --> 3391.839
a show every single day for years

3396.88 --> 3402.0
my take you tend to blackfill a lot bit

3399.28 --> 3402.0
of a downer

3402.839 --> 3422.24
right you got a point

3419.2 --> 3424.64
so so that is it you think

3422.24 --> 3427.1189999999997
because i have trouble even seeing that

3424.64 --> 3427.1189999999997
at times

3430.24 --> 3437.52
right i'd love to talk about gardens

3433.599 --> 3440.92
and happy animals and children

3437.52 --> 3445.599
and good things all day long

3440.92 --> 3448.16
unfortunately that's not my life

3445.599 --> 3451.28
i was stupid enough not to go for that

3448.16 --> 3454.8799999999997
or rather i gave it up

3451.28 --> 3454.88
because i was a freaking idiot

3457.04 --> 3463.839
i got black pill way back

3461.44 --> 3466.559
and it messed me up it messed me up

3463.839 --> 3466.5589999999997
really bad

3468.16 --> 3471.2
like emotionally

3471.28 --> 3476.88
and i'm still recovering from it like 20

3474.16 --> 3476.8799999999997
years later

3484.4 --> 3487.52
so did you get that

3490.4 --> 3495.28
it's right there i posted it in the chat

3496.96 --> 3503.52
right so i don't want to be that guy

3500.839 --> 3506.4
right that's just like oh

3503.52 --> 3508.799
i feel shitty again in a way i present

3506.4 --> 3509.76
it because i am hopeful that i will get

3508.799 --> 3513.359
out of it

3509.76 --> 3516.1600000000003
if i didn't have any hope i'd step away

3513.359 --> 3520.64
right because i'm kind of like just

3516.16 --> 3520.64
publicly trying to fix myself here

3522.4 --> 3529.28
right 20 years ago i couldn't even

3525.68 --> 3531.359
imagine that it was possible i was just

3529.28 --> 3532.6400000000003
kind of like counting down the time

3531.359 --> 3535.7599999999998
before i die a

3532.64 --> 3538.5589999999997
miserable end literally

3535.76 --> 3542.4
that was 20 years ago i'm trying to get

3538.559 --> 3542.4
out of that i'm trying to get it back

3542.839 --> 3549.52
somehow

3544.88 --> 3552.2400000000002
get back what i originally had

3549.52 --> 3554.64
problem was it was before i figured out

3552.24 --> 3556.8799999999997
what this world was

3554.64 --> 3559.68
and i'm literally having trouble just

3556.88 --> 3562.319
dealing with

3559.68 --> 3562.319
the world

3564.64 --> 3568.96
and ma and me like what am i in this

3567.28 --> 3573.8390000000004
world

3568.96 --> 3573.839
what am i what should i do

3589.76 --> 3601.8390000000004
right and i'm sorry if that's a downer i

3592.96 --> 3601.839
really am

3602.0 --> 3608.079
look but hey if if you want me to rather

3605.359 --> 3611.359
go into escapist mode and just

3608.079 --> 3614.7200000000003
say okay i am not tolerating

3611.359 --> 3616.4
any form of negative feeling on screen

3614.72 --> 3619.5989999999997
again

3616.4 --> 3623.44
right so i will literally force myself

3619.599 --> 3626.1600000000003
to go into bypass escapism mode and just

3623.44 --> 3627.119
find nice things to talk about only nice

3626.16 --> 3630.3999999999996
things

3627.119 --> 3633.04
would that make things better

3630.4 --> 3635.6800000000003
would it be a more pleasant place to

3633.04 --> 3635.68
hang around

3639.28 --> 3646.0
right would there be the same learning

3642.72 --> 3648.48
curve or would it just be

3646.0 --> 3649.92
the place you like to hang around and

3648.48 --> 3652.64
just whatever

3649.92 --> 3657.2000000000003
because it doesn't really matter anymore

3652.64 --> 3660.48
it's all just

3657.2 --> 3661.7599999999998
place to wait so good and nice and oh

3660.48 --> 3665.2
you can just

3661.76 --> 3667.2000000000003
do whatever you like is that is that

3665.2 --> 3669.2
is that the problem is the problem that

3667.2 --> 3671.359
i am kind of a black pillar

3669.2 --> 3673.5989999999997
is that the problem i want to hear you

3671.359 --> 3676.319
guys put your opinion

3673.599 --> 3678.319
everybody in chat right is that the

3676.319 --> 3679.2
problem is the problem that i am just

3678.319 --> 3683.359
too

3679.2 --> 3699.839
negative is that the problem

3683.359 --> 3699.839
tell me in chat right now

3703.599 --> 3713.839
all right let's see if this guy added me

3724.839 --> 3727.839
one

3738.839 --> 3741.839
so

3752.839 --> 3755.839
one

3771.76 --> 3783.8390000000004
all right thank you for the responses

3791.68 --> 3797.839
all right because

3795.119 --> 3800.2400000000002
yeah when it comes to negative attitude

3797.839 --> 3803.44
i only really see it as a problem when i

3800.24 --> 3803.4399999999996
feel really shitty

3804.0 --> 3808.24
because i don't always feel like that

3808.96 --> 3812.2400000000002
sometimes i feel great

3812.319 --> 3815.68
i'm inspired i got all kinds of things

3814.559 --> 3819.599
to say i got

3815.68 --> 3823.5989999999997
like new insights that i think are like

3819.599 --> 3825.28
really concentrated and valuable that i

3823.599 --> 3828.4
then share

3825.28 --> 3828.4
i got it plenty

3830.559 --> 3838.079
right and hey if you are somebody

3834.64 --> 3839.7599999999998
that invites me on some platform and you

3838.079 --> 3843.28
got like okay

3839.76 --> 3845.5200000000004
this this thing i don't want that

3843.28 --> 3846.7200000000003
i don't want that out of you when you

3845.52 --> 3850.0
get on this show

3846.72 --> 3851.2
i can actually do that right i can do

3850.0 --> 3854.96
that

3851.2 --> 3858.8799999999997
like i don't have to be negative

3854.96 --> 3863.599
or i don't have to be angry as i say i

3858.88 --> 3867.039
i have like impulse control like that

3863.599 --> 3867.6800000000003
but it's got to be like decided it's got

3867.039 --> 3871.119
to be

3867.68 --> 3874.48
stated because when it's not

3871.119 --> 3878.079
when it's simply just free i'm just

3874.48 --> 3878.079
going to do whatever comes out

3879.76 --> 3885.8390000000004
and i'm basically going to be bound

3883.039 --> 3895.8390000000004
by my own personal code of conduct

3885.839 --> 3895.839
that's it

3910.559 --> 3914.88
there's a difference between being

3912.24 --> 3917.4399999999996
professional and being raw right

3914.88 --> 3918.96
and on this show i am kind of raw

3917.44 --> 3920.839
because i do it every freaking day

3918.96 --> 3923.839
there's no other way to do it

3920.839 --> 3923.839
right

3924.16 --> 3931.0389999999998
but yeah on other shows

3927.44 --> 3934.799
on other people's shows i can

3931.039 --> 3935.28
be professional right and i'm not gonna

3934.799 --> 3938.799
get

3935.28 --> 3942.2400000000002
political right let's just say

3938.799 --> 3944.88
in theory like i would get on some panel

3942.24 --> 3945.839
with like david weiss and jaron or

3944.88 --> 3948.839
something

3945.839 --> 3950.48
you think i'm going to like go punish

3948.839 --> 3953.52
them for

3950.48 --> 3956.559
assuming a disc and the sun

3953.52 --> 3957.119
literally flying over no i'm not going

3956.559 --> 3960.799
to

3957.119 --> 3962.0
punish them i am not there to basically

3960.799 --> 3965.0389999999998
be like

3962.0 --> 3965.92
i'm better than you i'm better than you

3965.039 --> 3967.76
because i

3965.92 --> 3970.0
need the special boy that knows the

3967.76 --> 3972.6400000000003
little detail a little better

3970.0 --> 3973.52
right no i'm not gonna do that you don't

3972.64 --> 3977.2799999999997
why don't you

3973.52 --> 3977.7599999999998
see that i won't do that i will only do

3977.28 --> 3980.96
that

3977.76 --> 3984.7990000000004
if you literally ask me

3980.96 --> 3986.799
to do that right because i don't want to

3984.799 --> 3989.44
get in your hair

3986.799 --> 3990.48
if you have trouble with it or you want

3989.44 --> 3993.76
to hold on to

3990.48 --> 3995.359
this specific approach of explaining

3993.76 --> 3997.6800000000003
things

3995.359 --> 3998.799
i'm not gonna hold it against you i've

3997.68 --> 4003.2799999999997
even explained

3998.799 --> 4006.96
way way back four years ago and more

4003.28 --> 4009.8390000000004
like yeah i get it for somebody

4006.96 --> 4012.319
that believes in the globe earth and the

4009.839 --> 4015.599
sun being millions of miles away

4012.319 --> 4018.4
yeah it's the next best

4015.599 --> 4020.4
alternative explanation to kind of get

4018.4 --> 4024.559
people's head out

4020.4 --> 4028.64
of seeing it in the heliocentric way

4024.559 --> 4031.52
right you don't start out just by saying

4028.64 --> 4032.72
yeah it's holograms there's no actual

4031.52 --> 4035.92
position that's just gonna

4032.72 --> 4037.72
weird the freak out of people

4035.92 --> 4039.2000000000003
when they're still completely used to

4037.72 --> 4042.319
heliocentrism i

4039.2 --> 4047.359
get that right i'm not

4042.319 --> 4051.2799999999997
going to punish you if you do that

4047.359 --> 4053.0389999999998
but as side notes i will keep reminding

4051.28 --> 4055.3590000000004
people about it

4053.039 --> 4055.3590000000004
right

4058.799 --> 4066.96
i just wish i got a little bit more

4062.0 --> 4069.68
contact from people like reaching out

4066.96 --> 4072.2400000000002
but maybe i need to actually do the

4069.68 --> 4072.64
reaching out maybe i just need to email

4072.24 --> 4074.839
them

4072.64 --> 4077.0389999999998
like hey can i get on your show or

4074.839 --> 4079.92
something

4077.039 --> 4079.92
maybe that's it

4080.16 --> 4085.1189999999997
maybe i just haven't done that and

4082.72 --> 4087.7599999999998
that's bad i need to do it maybe i just

4085.119 --> 4088.4
need to freaking find these people's

4087.76 --> 4091.5200000000004
emails

4088.4 --> 4093.76
and email them

4091.52 --> 4094.88
what do you guys say should i do that

4093.76 --> 4098.159000000001
should i just just

4094.88 --> 4102.839
email jaren email david weiss

4098.159 --> 4105.839
email them all try to email owen

4102.839 --> 4105.839
benjamin

4110.239 --> 4115.5199999999995
maybe that's the problem maybe the

4113.6 --> 4118.96
problem is is that they just

4115.52 --> 4121.1990000000005
don't really care

4118.96 --> 4124.4800000000005
as long as somebody doesn't directly

4121.199 --> 4127.839
start contacting them

4124.48 --> 4129.5199999999995
because they're probably a lot more busy

4127.839 --> 4133.839
and i bet they're getting snowed under

4129.52 --> 4133.839000000001
by a lot of emails

4144.88 --> 4161.839
rainbows and helicopters and worse right

4171.359 --> 4178.08
yeah he's talking here over skype

4174.56 --> 4182.080000000001
pretty good it's done a two

4178.08 --> 4189.839
hour interview about the topic

4182.08 --> 4189.839
huh that sounds interesting

4198.0 --> 4201.52
have you considered producing some

4199.76 --> 4204.8
static content i have

4201.52 --> 4207.280000000001
static content sort of

4204.8 --> 4208.08
it's my first shows it's the flat earth

4207.28 --> 4211.199
talks

4208.08 --> 4211.84
it was all subject oriented because i

4211.199 --> 4214.4
did a

4211.84 --> 4216.0
weekly show and then i would just gather

4214.4 --> 4219.36
a subject

4216.0 --> 4223.12
and then yeah play it

4219.36 --> 4223.12
basically play it out live

4225.199 --> 4231.839999999999
right look i would if i just say okay

4229.52 --> 4233.360000000001
no more early bird show it's done it's

4231.84 --> 4237.12
over i'm not doing an

4233.36 --> 4240.239
everyday show anymore that'll get back

4237.12 --> 4240.96
i swear it it will like that cannot be

4240.239 --> 4244.639999999999
avoided

4240.96 --> 4248.0
that will happen

4244.64 --> 4251.76
it's because i do a show every day

4248.0 --> 4253.92
that i just it's more about the

4251.76 --> 4256.0
interaction with chat now than about

4253.92 --> 4256.8
subjects because i talk about these

4256.0 --> 4260.8
subjects

4256.8 --> 4260.8
so much so constantly

4261.36 --> 4277.679
just i'm tired of it

4273.84 --> 4277.679
someone sees your content what

4278.8 --> 4284.56
someone sees my contact and more likely

4280.56 --> 4284.56
to invite me on to their shows

4285.04 --> 4290.08
right okay well

4288.4 --> 4292.239
if that's the way it is then it's going

4290.08 --> 4293.679
to be bye bye early bird show no more

4292.239 --> 4296.32
early bird show because

4293.679 --> 4297.76
i can't do that on top of what i do

4296.32 --> 4301.84
right now

4297.76 --> 4301.84
it's just not going to happen

4318.64 --> 4321.4400000000005
yeah i agree

4321.84 --> 4328.2390000000005
i agree iron 26 yeah that's right

4325.92 --> 4330.719
so it's basically just the early bird

4328.239 --> 4330.718999999999
show then

4330.88 --> 4335.52
it's the setup is not working it's not

4333.6 --> 4357.84

4681.44 --> 4687.839999999999
like ever when's the last time i was

4684.32 --> 4691.759999999999
invited on any kind of show

4687.84 --> 4693.84
it was iron realm like three years ago

4691.76 --> 4693.84
now

4694.88 --> 4701.12
what do you think that is i'm wondering

4698.64 --> 4703.1990000000005
i've literally been asking people in my

4701.12 --> 4705.599999999999
chat like can you explain it to me

4703.199 --> 4706.719
somebody one said like okay maybe it's

4705.6 --> 4708.56
because you're a little bit too

4706.719 --> 4710.96
black-pilled

4708.56 --> 4713.04
right and then it's been discussed like

4710.96 --> 4713.84
yeah it's because i'm raw it's because i

4713.04 --> 4716.8
do it show

4713.84 --> 4717.84
every day for two hours you can't do

4716.8 --> 4719.84
that

4717.84 --> 4721.28
you can't be just the pure information

4719.84 --> 4723.360000000001
show then

4721.28 --> 4725.199
right unless you're freaking owen

4723.36 --> 4727.12
benjamin some talented bar

4725.199 --> 4729.919999999999
that can just constantly keep

4727.12 --> 4733.199
entertaining on a daily basis

4729.92 --> 4735.52
right i i don't know how to do that

4733.199 --> 4737.36
so i'm just going to be more raw me more

4735.52 --> 4741.84
like a personal study

4737.36 --> 4745.04
kind of thing public and i don't know

4741.84 --> 4745.04
maybe that's the problem

4745.36 --> 4749.839999999999
maybe just think it's cause you have

4746.8 --> 4749.84
your own show

4749.92 --> 4756.0
but you're part of flattered what

4753.199 --> 4758.96
you're like you're like a main cog in

4756.0 --> 4758.96
flat earth debate

4760.84 --> 4766.2390000000005
but why

4763.679 --> 4768.64
why would that prevent other people from

4766.239 --> 4769.678999999999
inviting me to become part of their show

4768.64 --> 4772.719
sometime

4769.679 --> 4774.4800000000005
right remember like years ago that sort

4772.719 --> 4778.159
of [ __ ] constantly happened

4774.48 --> 4781.199
everybody always had somebody on

4778.159 --> 4783.28
remember yeah but it's not no more it

4781.199 --> 4785.28
isn't like that anymore

4783.28 --> 4787.599999999999
i don't think so maybe jared and

4785.28 --> 4789.599999999999
goldbusters still do that

4787.6 --> 4790.64
but uh was the last time anybody came on

4789.6 --> 4795.120000000001
nathan's show

4790.64 --> 4798.4800000000005
think about that well there's newcomers

4795.12 --> 4801.5199999999995
yeah newcomers the regular guys

4798.48 --> 4805.839999999999
but um chemo tried to get on uh

4801.52 --> 4805.84
fight tight shirt

4806.4 --> 4809.759999999999
i think the content you put out on your

4808.56 --> 4813.04
show

4809.76 --> 4814.56
and your input in flatter debates is

4813.04 --> 4816.159
and then sometimes you know i used to

4814.56 --> 4819.280000000001
face the same thing when i

4816.159 --> 4821.199
first started preaching so i just said

4819.28 --> 4823.759999999999
you know what i'm going to invite myself

4821.199 --> 4825.36
so i'd be preaching on the streets see

4823.76 --> 4826.719
another christian group i go out to the

4825.36 --> 4828.5599999999995
past and say hey i would love to share

4826.719 --> 4830.4800000000005
in your church one time

4828.56 --> 4832.0
and bang that was it that godlike

4830.48 --> 4833.04
charities church

4832.0 --> 4837.52
maybe that's what you're going to start

4833.04 --> 4840.719
doing knock down them doors always

4837.52 --> 4844.88
wait what sharing this church

4840.719 --> 4847.36
yes you know a word at the church

4844.88 --> 4849.04
you know when i first started preaching

4847.36 --> 4850.719
i was a street preacher

4849.04 --> 4852.159
i'd go into the drug infested

4850.719 --> 4854.8
neighborhoods

4852.159 --> 4855.36
bring up a bunch of food and i would

4854.8 --> 4857.679
start

4855.36 --> 4860.719
doing a feed up and then i would plug in

4857.679 --> 4862.96
an amplifier and i'd start preaching

4860.719 --> 4864.0
the gospel and i would try to bring

4862.96 --> 4867.679
people out of

4864.0 --> 4868.4
you know drug addictions into a place

4867.679 --> 4870.719
where they could get

4868.4 --> 4873.36
themselves detoxed and then into a

4870.719 --> 4875.84
christian-based drug program

4873.36 --> 4877.44
so i was like why is nobody inviting me

4875.84 --> 4879.18
to that church so i just started

4877.44 --> 4880.96
inviting myself to that church

4879.18 --> 4883.280000000001
[Music]

4880.96 --> 4885.76
and um yeah i spoke about three or four

4883.28 --> 4885.759999999999
churches

4886.56 --> 4890.0
right yeah well i've we've been to the

4889.44 --> 4892.0
church

4890.0 --> 4893.199
like over here right across the street

4892.0 --> 4896.96
right i

4893.199 --> 4900.08
even from in the flatter talks days

4896.96 --> 4902.56
and i yeah have many experiences there

4900.08 --> 4904.159
reported about it even like brought flat

4902.56 --> 4906.400000000001
earth to a couple of people

4904.159 --> 4908.5599999999995
but i was also struggling with just the

4906.4 --> 4911.92
chaos of my visions and like

4908.56 --> 4913.679
delusions within it

4911.92 --> 4914.96
trying to get that out of the way so

4913.679 --> 4918.08
that yeah

4914.96 --> 4919.6
and now it's kind of like a

4918.08 --> 4921.44
well they're not really having any

4919.6 --> 4924.2390000000005
weekly service anymore

4921.44 --> 4925.04
right it's kind of abandoned so i

4924.239 --> 4926.959999999999
couldn't

4925.04 --> 4930.32
do it it should be coming back but i'm

4926.96 --> 4933.52
saying you can use that same technique

4930.32 --> 4933.5199999999995
and reach out to all

4934.08 --> 4937.6
well here's a better one here's a better

4936.32 --> 4940.0
one

4937.6 --> 4941.679
why don't you contact mark sergeant

4940.0 --> 4945.84
he'll come on your show

4941.679 --> 4945.84
like sergeant

4947.12 --> 4950.8
he gives all these chicken interviews i

4949.04 --> 4954.8
would reach out to him

4950.8 --> 4956.8
hey i have a flatter debate show

4954.8 --> 4959.4400000000005
is the name of it flat earth early bird

4956.8 --> 4961.1990000000005
i precede flat earth debate with nathan

4959.44 --> 4963.12
oakley i'm on the panel

4961.199 --> 4964.638999999999
i i just would like you to come on my

4963.12 --> 4966.88
show he would

4964.639 --> 4967.92
definitely i'd be shocked if he don't

4966.88 --> 4970.84
come on your show

4967.92 --> 4972.56
well i wouldn't be because it's really

4970.84 --> 4974.4800000000005
early

4972.56 --> 4976.080000000001
it doesn't matter about sergeant's ace

4974.48 --> 4979.04
man he he goes

4976.08 --> 4981.04
he's still the same man he goes to all

4979.04 --> 4981.679
these colleges when they invite them and

4981.04 --> 4985.679
he gets

4981.679 --> 4986.8
interviews all right maybe give it a

4985.679 --> 4989.84
shot

4986.8 --> 4993.12
right but but you're right i've also

4989.84 --> 4993.12
concluded this is that

4994.719 --> 5000.0
i should literally email people

4998.0 --> 5002.08
because i don't typically do that i'm

5000.0 --> 5002.56
not i'm a person that doesn't really

5002.08 --> 5005.36
seek

5002.56 --> 5007.360000000001
contact through email and [ __ ] and i'm

5005.36 --> 5009.44
regretting it big time now

5007.36 --> 5011.759999999999
because i should probably have done that

5009.44 --> 5011.759999999999
a lot

5013.52 --> 5018.96
he more noticed that girl rachey i sent

5017.04 --> 5020.8
a few comments to her so

5018.96 --> 5022.4800000000005
he pays attention to what's going on in

5020.8 --> 5025.52
flat earth

5022.48 --> 5028.959999999999
he sent her a few comments and she's no

5025.52 --> 5031.92
big thing rachey she's just a

5028.96 --> 5035.04
girl that's talking about flat earth oh

5031.92 --> 5035.04
that's a big thing isn't it

5037.679 --> 5041.6
right but it is kind of a big thing

5040.159 --> 5044.08
because it's a girl

5041.6 --> 5044.96
there's not so many of them compared to

5044.08 --> 5047.76
guys

5044.96 --> 5049.76
but she's not like a big personality

5047.76 --> 5052.639
she's just a regular girl

5049.76 --> 5052.639
right you know

5053.199 --> 5057.839999999999
and uh he he made sure he sent some

5055.76 --> 5060.56
comments away

5057.84 --> 5062.159000000001
it means a lot you know because even

5060.56 --> 5064.080000000001
though i don't agree with everything he

5062.159 --> 5066.08
says like i hate the fact that he uses a

5064.08 --> 5068.0
model and stuff like that he still

5066.08 --> 5070.719
thinks about believes that there's some

5068.0 --> 5073.12
sort of gravity

5070.719 --> 5074.8
but hey he gets to he gets the message

5073.12 --> 5076.639
across and then when they

5074.8 --> 5078.56
get advanced they find the flatter

5076.639 --> 5083.4400000000005
debates and your own bad shows

5078.56 --> 5086.4800000000005
you know right

5083.44 --> 5086.48
yeah you sort it out

5087.6 --> 5090.8
i don't think he's a showman thinks he's

5090.32 --> 5094.88
a [ __ ]

5090.8 --> 5094.88
the pj thinks everybody's a shield

5096.719 --> 5101.28
yeah he's funny though man and you're

5099.28 --> 5101.759999999999
right i remember you a long time ago

5101.28 --> 5105.5199999999995
saying

5101.76 --> 5109.04
pete put your stuff together and present

5105.52 --> 5111.6
it he's all over the place right

5109.04 --> 5112.56
i've been saying that for years he's

5111.6 --> 5116.08
never done it though

5112.56 --> 5116.080000000001
so like how can you take him serious

5117.6 --> 5121.84
you can't because he's apparently not

5119.52 --> 5126.8
really taking himself all that serious

5121.84 --> 5129.12
or he would have done something with it

5126.8 --> 5129.12
right

5131.04 --> 5138.08
right but yeah you might be right

5134.48 --> 5139.04
i thought about it too just contacting

5138.08 --> 5141.76
people

5139.04 --> 5143.76
just emailing them saying i should just

5141.76 --> 5147.280000000001
instead of saying it on my show and

5143.76 --> 5151.76
assume that they're gonna bump into it

5147.28 --> 5151.759999999999
actually just email them

5152.84 --> 5156.56
yep

5154.56 --> 5160.4800000000005
i'm gonna have to put that on an agenda

5156.56 --> 5160.4800000000005
point and like really get to that

5163.199 --> 5167.759999999999
yeah but did the growth man did they

5165.44 --> 5169.199
really the only way

5167.76 --> 5171.4400000000005
like i don't have a channel but the only

5169.199 --> 5173.5199999999995
way flat earth is going to grow is

5171.44 --> 5175.678999999999
like nathan says sharing it i try to

5173.52 --> 5178.719
share everything your shows

5175.679 --> 5180.4800000000005
uh dating shows i try to

5178.719 --> 5182.08
try to share them and hopefully

5180.48 --> 5183.678999999999
somewhere they'll stick but i think it's

5182.08 --> 5186.239
reaching a lot more than

5183.679 --> 5186.88
people think i don't think it's some

5186.239 --> 5190.4
obscure

5186.88 --> 5192.32
little corner in the internet well if it

5190.4 --> 5197.12
was then it's like

5192.32 --> 5199.84
totally mashing the numbers up

5197.12 --> 5201.5199999999995
there was a girl that came on uh 24 7

5199.84 --> 5203.76
the other day discord

5201.52 --> 5205.52
irish girl and they you know her name

5203.76 --> 5208.4800000000005
was scarlett rose

5205.52 --> 5210.080000000001
and she said she just uh she just heard

5208.48 --> 5212.159
about flat earth

5210.08 --> 5213.84
so then she found that channel so it's

5212.159 --> 5217.839999999999
all about the base and

5213.84 --> 5217.84
look it's getting it's getting around

5217.92 --> 5221.28
well the flatter debate is just it's a

5220.32 --> 5222.799999999999
success right

5221.28 --> 5224.5599999999995
doesn't really matter it's supposed to

5222.8 --> 5228.159000000001
be a small channel

5224.56 --> 5230.8
because just the sheer echoing of it all

5228.159 --> 5232.159
and the higher like higher subscriber

5230.8 --> 5236.2390000000005
people

5232.159 --> 5238.239
giving mentions and all that like

5236.239 --> 5240.0
it doesn't really matter like how many

5238.239 --> 5242.959999999999
subscribers nathan even has

5240.0 --> 5244.56
it's like the influence is literally

5242.96 --> 5248.719
measurable

5244.56 --> 5252.639
right right but with me

5248.719 --> 5256.56
i don't know man it's

5252.639 --> 5259.4400000000005
me yeah i'm not formulaic enough maybe

5256.56 --> 5259.4400000000005
i don't know what it is

5259.6 --> 5262.639
but there are a lot of people i bump

5261.84 --> 5264.400000000001
into that

5262.639 --> 5266.2390000000005
know me it's really weird because

5264.4 --> 5268.879999999999
sometimes it's like

5266.239 --> 5270.5599999999995
people don't like run up to me like oh

5268.88 --> 5272.56
it's him it's him it's him or something

5270.56 --> 5274.56
but i do get the feeling like a lot of

5272.56 --> 5278.320000000001
people just know about me and are like

5274.56 --> 5280.159000000001
maybe slightly intimidated or something

5278.32 --> 5282.159
yeah your name rings bells in the flat

5280.159 --> 5285.599999999999
earth arena right

5282.159 --> 5289.199
i know it does it's just that

5285.6 --> 5290.2390000000005
i'm not really seeing the feedback of

5289.199 --> 5293.599999999999
that

5290.239 --> 5296.879999999999
like in my situation right

5293.6 --> 5300.4800000000005
and that's the weird part because nobody

5296.88 --> 5303.4400000000005
emails me nobody

5300.48 --> 5303.44
literally nobody

5303.679 --> 5307.1990000000005
you're very very smart that is

5305.6 --> 5310.2390000000005
intimidating i got

5307.199 --> 5313.28
oh [ __ ] sake

5310.239 --> 5316.879999999999
really but i'm also so

5313.28 --> 5319.5199999999995
stupid you know that that

5316.88 --> 5322.32
that is something that you know even

5319.52 --> 5324.0
people feel a little intimidated

5322.32 --> 5325.44
like i'm going to talk to this guy me i

5324.0 --> 5326.8
don't give a [ __ ] that's that

5325.44 --> 5328.4
personality i am

5326.8 --> 5329.76
i know i don't get the witch everybody

5328.4 --> 5330.96
else has but i want to be part of

5329.76 --> 5334.0
something here

5330.96 --> 5335.84
right just come in with my brazen white

5334.0 --> 5337.44
and that's it but other people that

5335.84 --> 5340.159000000001
don't have

5337.44 --> 5340.48
my personality they're going to shy away

5340.159 --> 5342.4
i

5340.48 --> 5343.678999999999
didn't even i can't even talk to this

5342.4 --> 5347.04
guy he's

5343.679 --> 5347.04
i can't even think like that

5348.88 --> 5352.32
not that you not that you present

5350.639 --> 5354.88
yourself that way

5352.32 --> 5357.12
you know don't get me wrong what do you

5354.88 --> 5357.12
mean

5357.44 --> 5362.0
right not like you're this guy like

5360.08 --> 5364.159
don't talk to me i'm too smart but

5362.0 --> 5366.88
people do get intimidated by your

5364.159 --> 5366.879999999999
intelligence

5369.6 --> 5374.8
right but i kind of expect that people

5372.8 --> 5378.320000000001
just respond then

5374.8 --> 5380.08
by basically challenging me and in ways

5378.32 --> 5381.28
i think that even like the trolls

5380.08 --> 5383.76
sometimes do that

5381.28 --> 5385.12
i think that some trolls might literally

5383.76 --> 5386.88
kind of be interested but

5385.12 --> 5390.159
intimidated and they're like trying to

5386.88 --> 5392.08
get rid of their own ghosts

5390.159 --> 5395.28
right and that's why i make the habit of

5392.08 --> 5398.96
literally answering

5395.28 --> 5403.36
excuse me dress the legend

5398.96 --> 5404.32
oh look at that oh look at the liar in

5403.36 --> 5408.239
chat don't

5404.32 --> 5410.799999999999
time him out he's just lying i've never

5408.239 --> 5413.12
threat he says i threatened to kill

5410.8 --> 5415.92
people

5413.12 --> 5417.44
no no no no trust no no i didn't do that

5415.92 --> 5421.1990000000005
i didn't do that right

5417.44 --> 5424.4
what i did is say people

5421.199 --> 5426.719
should if they're even too cowardly

5424.4 --> 5428.4
to basically reveal their identity and

5426.719 --> 5431.679
then just completely

5428.4 --> 5434.638999999999
try to psychologically break somebody

5431.679 --> 5436.0
to become really miserable without even

5434.639 --> 5438.08
revealing who they are and then

5436.0 --> 5439.6
persistently doing that stalking right i

5438.08 --> 5443.12
think that those people

5439.6 --> 5444.88
should basically do it to themselves

5443.12 --> 5446.8
right that's what i say i'd never

5444.88 --> 5449.52
threatened anybody

5446.8 --> 5451.04
right i i'll threaten people like hey

5449.52 --> 5452.639
why don't you come up to me and i'll

5451.04 --> 5455.12
bash your face in right

5452.639 --> 5455.76
if you act like that to my face that's

5455.12 --> 5458.159
the far

5455.76 --> 5459.04
the farthest i've ever gone when it

5458.159 --> 5461.5199999999995
comes to

5459.04 --> 5463.6
a direct threat right i think it's the

5461.52 --> 5465.84
opposite didn't bob no don't tell

5463.6 --> 5468.159000000001
you to go kill yourself that piece of

5465.84 --> 5468.159000000001
crap

5469.76 --> 5474.88
it may be out of context yeah no [ __ ]

5472.32 --> 5477.92
dress the legend

5474.88 --> 5480.2390000000005
you hear me yeah yeah sorry didn't bob

5477.92 --> 5484.08
no don't tell you to go kill yourself

5480.239 --> 5486.0
yes he did okay so out of nowhere

5484.08 --> 5488.0
even the same thing is saying i want to

5486.0 --> 5489.92
kill somebody

5488.0 --> 5491.92
and say hey go kill yourself you might

5489.92 --> 5495.52
as well just say i want to kill you

5491.92 --> 5498.08
you want the person dead right

5495.52 --> 5500.0
why does he get a pass because he's bob

5498.08 --> 5501.6
no doubt

5500.0 --> 5503.6
well you're not supposed to talk about

5501.6 --> 5506.56
it whenever he does something natural

5503.6 --> 5507.92
whatever the hell his stupid name is

5506.56 --> 5511.280000000001
what

5507.92 --> 5514.4
i don't is it weird yeah

5511.28 --> 5514.4
does that do something

5515.12 --> 5520.459
i literally can't stand his

5517.39 --> 5520.459000000001
[Music]

5521.44 --> 5526.879999999999
yeah me too jaren's pretty cool

5524.719 --> 5528.719
like he he knows there's just things

5526.88 --> 5531.36
wrong and he is trying to remain

5528.719 --> 5533.84
self-sufficient right and that's a good

5531.36 --> 5533.839999999999
thing

5534.56 --> 5541.04
but i agree it's just that

5537.84 --> 5544.2390000000005
like i would never say

5541.04 --> 5547.12
anything like that to anybody if i even

5544.239 --> 5549.28
if they even have an an online identity

5547.12 --> 5552.159
like for example dress hair

5549.28 --> 5553.12
i know dress is a real person that has

5552.159 --> 5556.799999999999
actually been

5553.12 --> 5557.599999999999
on shows having his voice heard like he

5556.8 --> 5560.2390000000005
has

5557.6 --> 5561.360000000001
a real identity i would never tell

5560.239 --> 5563.44
somebody like that

5561.36 --> 5565.28
that i know is a real person not trying

5563.44 --> 5567.759999999999
to hide themselves

5565.28 --> 5568.4
in order to bully others i would never

5567.76 --> 5571.76
tell

5568.4 --> 5571.759999999999
that to anybody like that

5572.159 --> 5578.879999999999
because then it's a real person

5575.28 --> 5578.88
right correct

5580.639 --> 5585.28
but if it's somebody that doesn't even

5583.199 --> 5585.839999999999
doesn't even give a hint as to who they

5585.28 --> 5588.239
are they're

5585.84 --> 5589.6
literally undercover just trying to make

5588.239 --> 5592.799999999999
you miserable

5589.6 --> 5596.0
right that that's beyond that's

5592.8 --> 5599.04
just evil it's just

5596.0 --> 5602.0
evil right and i think that that

5599.04 --> 5602.4
tendency what people allow themselves to

5602.0 --> 5604.8
do

5602.4 --> 5605.679
i think that's like a worldwide problem

5604.8 --> 5610.159000000001
that's not just

5605.679 --> 5613.92
my problem it's like a cultural plague

5610.159 --> 5616.08
and it's a real problem out there

5613.92 --> 5618.159
because it just think about these guys

5616.08 --> 5622.48
that are on every day

5618.159 --> 5626.0
all day long on their freaking keyboard

5622.48 --> 5629.04
just harassing flat earth in general

5626.0 --> 5631.84
i mean how can you i mean that's

5629.04 --> 5631.84
devotion

5632.51 --> 5636.4800000000005
[Music]

5634.48 --> 5638.5599999999995
either these people must be millionaires

5636.48 --> 5641.5199999999995
because i don't they work

5638.56 --> 5644.080000000001
they you know don't they have to pay

5641.52 --> 5647.120000000001
bills or something and make ends meet

5644.08 --> 5647.92
well maybe they do have jobs and they

5647.12 --> 5650.719
literally

5647.92 --> 5651.36
need to do the trolling in between just

5650.719 --> 5654.639
to stay

5651.36 --> 5657.44
sane because they cocked so hard they

5654.639 --> 5658.0
basically let nasty people they really

5657.44 --> 5660.96
actually

5658.0 --> 5662.159
hate take control over them and enslave

5660.96 --> 5665.199
them and bend them to

5662.159 --> 5668.0
their miserable will so they just need a

5665.199 --> 5671.199
a way out just a safe target where you

5668.0 --> 5675.12
can just be purely demonic

5671.199 --> 5677.199
because they're because they make money

5675.12 --> 5679.199
and they like sacrifice their soul

5677.199 --> 5680.799999999999
effectively to do that and then you end

5679.199 --> 5683.36
up with a lot of pain

5680.8 --> 5684.719
what are you gonna do with it well in

5683.36 --> 5687.199
between your work

5684.719 --> 5690.56
get on your mobile make a sock account

5687.199 --> 5694.0
and make somebody else's life miserable

5690.56 --> 5695.1990000000005
right that's what happens that's what a

5694.0 --> 5697.84
lot of people do

5695.199 --> 5700.32
rumpus i think rumpus is a rich i think

5697.84 --> 5702.159000000001
he was brought up rich

5700.32 --> 5704.239
and he just doesn't have to worry about

5702.159 --> 5705.679
bills or anything like that

5704.239 --> 5708.48
she could see his computer all the

5705.679 --> 5709.84
online and just pushed his heliocentric

5708.48 --> 5712.799999999999
nonsense

5709.84 --> 5716.56
yeah but rumpus is not but rumpus is not

5712.8 --> 5720.320000000001
a nasty demon rumpus is a genuine zealot

5716.56 --> 5723.4400000000005
right he's not really nasty he is just

5720.32 --> 5726.88
very very tricky as they say

5723.44 --> 5730.4
right very tricky but he's not evil

5726.88 --> 5733.1990000000005
he's not like he'll use bullying

5730.4 --> 5734.239
intimidation to kind of like get a bit

5733.199 --> 5736.879999999999
of a weight

5734.239 --> 5738.638999999999
as he tries to enter an argument like oh

5736.88 --> 5741.1990000000005
you you don't understand you're never

5738.639 --> 5745.28
got anything that nonsense

5741.199 --> 5749.5199999999995
yeah yeah but but that's rumpus right

5745.28 --> 5752.32
it's him right he's not a sock account

5749.52 --> 5754.56
anonymous anonymously doing that sort of

5752.32 --> 5758.239
[ __ ] to people he'll do it as him

5754.56 --> 5759.76
right that's different yeah some people

5758.239 --> 5761.04
have reasons i guess enough when they

5759.76 --> 5763.280000000001
reel their mouths that's why i think

5761.04 --> 5764.96
he's a rich guy

5763.28 --> 5767.44
put his name out there you're gonna know

5764.96 --> 5769.92
me you're gonna know me as the rumpus

5767.44 --> 5770.719
right me i got nothing to lose i got

5769.92 --> 5773.92
nothing to hack

5770.719 --> 5776.08
so i'm you know constantino

5773.92 --> 5777.1990000000005
okay you want to find out where i am or

5776.08 --> 5778.96
who i am

5777.199 --> 5782.48
you're more than welcome to i got

5778.96 --> 5784.159
nothing you could take

5782.48 --> 5786.718999999999
what if a guy's got something to protect

5784.159 --> 5788.879999999999
that can understand him not

5786.719 --> 5790.4
you know revealing his identity at first

5788.88 --> 5792.0
i was like oh these guys

5790.4 --> 5794.0
that don't reveal their identity and

5792.0 --> 5794.719
hide behind these names i got no use to

5794.0 --> 5797.36
them

5794.719 --> 5799.44
but you know everybody has reasons so i

5797.36 --> 5801.92
re-evaluated that

5799.44 --> 5804.0
right but you know even if you hide

5801.92 --> 5806.4800000000005
behind a fake name

5804.0 --> 5807.6
as long as you are going to get online

5806.48 --> 5809.919999999999
with your voice

5807.6 --> 5812.08
and your voice is recognizable then

5809.92 --> 5814.2390000000005
they're really not that anonymous right

5812.08 --> 5817.6
they're not fully anonymous they're just

5814.239 --> 5822.5599999999995
soft anonymous to avoid doxxing

5817.6 --> 5822.56
that's it i don't

5825.199 --> 5829.839999999999
so that think um i think after show

5830.159 --> 5833.679
i think it was right at the beginning of

5831.679 --> 5836.56
the pandemic

5833.679 --> 5838.4800000000005
we had that long after show that he had

5836.56 --> 5840.2390000000005
come on

5838.48 --> 5841.839999999999
i never know what he sounds like but i

5840.239 --> 5845.599999999999
just know i could

5841.84 --> 5845.6
stand his comments in the chat

5846.32 --> 5850.96
yeah he always sounds like he has socks

5848.88 --> 5855.84
in his cheeks

5850.96 --> 5855.84
it's totally weird

5856.0 --> 5860.159
right but mark taylor really is kind of

5858.48 --> 5861.678999999999
like a

5860.159 --> 5864.239
bit of a bottom to weather he doesn't

5861.679 --> 5868.88
really even come out of the

5864.239 --> 5871.28
the chat rooms anymore a discord

5868.88 --> 5872.88
jam pandas is he hanging around there i

5871.28 --> 5876.48
wouldn't know i don't go there

5872.88 --> 5876.4800000000005
i never go there right

5877.44 --> 5882.0
but i'd see him hang around that place

5879.76 --> 5883.6
you know

5882.0 --> 5885.36
listen when jim panda comes on the

5883.6 --> 5887.1990000000005
ladies night

5885.36 --> 5889.839999999999
they were dealing with this other guy

5887.199 --> 5892.239
and he comes out of nowhere

5889.84 --> 5893.679
and starts pumping this nonsense one of

5892.239 --> 5895.28
them said were you

5893.679 --> 5896.4800000000005
well you're begging a question there

5895.28 --> 5898.08
because how can i be backing the

5896.48 --> 5899.44
question if i never even ask the

5898.08 --> 5902.0
question

5899.44 --> 5903.04
like really he doesn't put two and two

5902.0 --> 5906.4
together that if you

5903.04 --> 5909.28
are believing in

5906.4 --> 5910.96
this globe earth nonsense that you are

5909.28 --> 5914.0
begging the question

5910.96 --> 5914.0
just in your belief

5914.8 --> 5921.679
anyway it is what it is

5918.4 --> 5925.44
indeed i got to take care of something

5921.679 --> 5928.719

and if he doesn't then i'll shoot him an

5938.88 --> 5944.56
email that he should join them

5941.199 --> 5947.759999999999

5955.92 --> 5961.4400000000005
he's easily reachable all right well

5959.04 --> 5964.08
yeah by the way what is he yeah i

5961.44 --> 5964.08
remember that

5964.4 --> 5969.28
oh god he got he got phone trolled so

5985.6 --> 5992.159000000001
yeah i don't know i'm in the netherlands

5989.28 --> 5992.159
the netherlands

5992.639 --> 5995.679
okay yeah netherlands right it locked

5994.96 --> 5999.119
down

5995.679 --> 5999.92
sort of it's it's a weird situation out

5999.119 --> 6002.08
here

5999.92 --> 6004.4
it really seems like the whole thing is

6002.08 --> 6007.04
just a giant bluff really

6004.4 --> 6008.159
like they're acting like it's basically

6007.04 --> 6010.639
oh it's getting worse

6008.159 --> 6012.32
and this they have to do more but

6010.639 --> 6016.159000000001
effectively like the people

6012.32 --> 6019.119
are like even like the normies

6016.159 --> 6021.28
like a lot of them the more wiser

6019.119 --> 6023.759999999999
normies i could guess

6021.28 --> 6025.84
are like yeah we're kind of done with

6023.76 --> 6028.56
this nonsense

6025.84 --> 6029.52
like they still go with the habits but

6028.56 --> 6031.6
like nobody's

6029.52 --> 6032.8
really buying it anymore it's more like

6031.6 --> 6035.4400000000005
now like an

6032.8 --> 6037.119000000001
after it's becoming like an after act

6035.44 --> 6038.239
and people are just doing it out of

6037.119 --> 6040.08
habit

6038.239 --> 6041.5199999999995
yeah now they're pushing the race the

6040.08 --> 6043.28
race wars over here

6041.52 --> 6044.719
i just got a bad feeling that this

6043.28 --> 6047.199
summer does

6044.719 --> 6049.52
a lot more riots going on with all these

6047.199 --> 6051.199
i don't even know if these shootings are

6049.52 --> 6053.76
the riots last year were already

6051.199 --> 6057.36
terrible girl

6053.76 --> 6057.360000000001
was getting ready to stab another girl

6057.92 --> 6061.92
over there i don't know if any of it's

6060.08 --> 6063.76
true you know who knows what these

6061.92 --> 6066.8
listen the world's being run by

6063.76 --> 6068.639
psychopaths and with that i gotta run

6066.8 --> 6070.320000000001
all right see you over there with the uh

6068.639 --> 6071.84
flattering debate yeah all right hey

6070.32 --> 6079.84
thanks for coming on man

6071.84 --> 6079.84
no worries great pleasure you

6082.8 --> 6085.92
yeah that was good

6090.48 --> 6093.839999999999
all right and i'm back

6100.239 --> 6107.839999999999
it's in the skype message what

6110.48 --> 6116.32
eric dubay would be great on here

6113.84 --> 6118.8
i don't know if eric dubay agrees i

6116.32 --> 6120.96
remember him calling me a crypto jew and

6118.8 --> 6124.0
all that

6120.96 --> 6125.76
and maybe i am i don't know

6124.0 --> 6128.719
that's why it's a crypto jew you don't

6125.76 --> 6132.639
actually know if you are

6128.719 --> 6135.84
just kidding uh what

6132.639 --> 6135.84
yeah sure

6136.08 --> 6140.08
but i don't i think he thinks i'm

6138.48 --> 6143.36
beneath him

6140.08 --> 6146.08
i really do so

6143.36 --> 6148.5599999999995
i don't think eric dube is going to see

6146.08 --> 6149.04
contact with me i'm not big enough i'm

6148.56 --> 6152.159000000001
not

6149.04 --> 6156.96
bro-ish enough or whatever i

6152.159 --> 6156.96
i've said some things about him right

6158.4 --> 6164.48
so i don't know maybe he's

6162.239 --> 6167.678999999999
he would be willing to do it if we can

6164.48 --> 6170.959999999999
stick to true cosmogeny details

6167.679 --> 6170.96
that would be interesting

6171.52 --> 6176.320000000001
you know i might email him i should

6174.719 --> 6178.8
freaking do that because

6176.32 --> 6180.4
this idea that they're just gonna watch

6178.8 --> 6182.56
my show and then contact me

6180.4 --> 6184.48
is kind of ridiculous and outdated by

6182.56 --> 6191.84
now so

6184.48 --> 6191.839999999999
yeah i might just do that

6193.36 --> 6199.119
in ways i need to do it i need to just

6196.4 --> 6199.119
reach out

6200.4 --> 6207.759999999999
right because reaching out through my

6203.44 --> 6210.638999999999
shows verbally it's not really working

6207.76 --> 6213.04
like it might work for you to like drop

6210.639 --> 6216.2390000000005
ideas

6213.04 --> 6218.639
and such things like but

6216.239 --> 6220.959999999999
yeah that's about it if i just want

6218.639 --> 6223.28
actual contact want somebody actually on

6220.96 --> 6225.679
my show i should contact them

6223.28 --> 6227.599999999999
through email and i i need to do this

6225.679 --> 6228.08
i'm literally gonna make a note about it

6227.6 --> 6231.1990000000005
and i

6228.08 --> 6233.84
am going to do that this weekend

6231.199 --> 6233.839999999999
swear it

6261.36 --> 6267.92
you went to eric skypes

6264.719 --> 6267.92
asking him what

6273.119 --> 6276.32
right well it's very unlikely it's going

6275.28 --> 6278.0
to respond to me

6276.32 --> 6281.84
but it doesn't mean that i shouldn't

6278.0 --> 6281.84
just officially do it anyway

6283.119 --> 6288.08
i should just freaking throw the

6286.119 --> 6290.639
bureaucracy over the world

6288.08 --> 6292.28
it's just like okay darwinian government

6290.639 --> 6293.679
is gonna start and i'm gonna

6292.28 --> 6297.28
bureaucratize the

6293.679 --> 6300.4
[ __ ] out of it right because i could

6297.28 --> 6302.0
i just tend to hate it tend to like

6300.4 --> 6307.44
completely 100

6302.0 --> 6307.44
avoid it and i need to stop doing that

6310.56 --> 6317.280000000001
so yeah i will contact mark sergeant

6314.08 --> 6318.96
like what neil suggested that would be

6317.28 --> 6322.88
cool

6318.96 --> 6322.88
i might email eric to bay

6323.84 --> 6330.0
i think i should definitely

6326.88 --> 6332.32
also email contact david weiss

6330.0 --> 6332.32
again

6335.199 --> 6345.839999999999
just to ask him like hey will you have

6337.6 --> 6345.84
me on or whatever i'm up for that

6355.6 --> 6361.04
right so i don't know i'm gonna do that

6358.88 --> 6363.4400000000005
maybe i'm not gonna have any shows this

6361.04 --> 6363.44
weekend

6363.52 --> 6368.400000000001
i might just completely avoid it or i'll

6366.239 --> 6371.28
just do it anyway

6368.4 --> 6375.119
i'm just keeping it optional that i

6371.28 --> 6375.119
might not do any shows this weekend

6375.679 --> 6379.04
because i need to do [ __ ] i need to

6378.32 --> 6382.48
reach out

6379.04 --> 6387.84
like actually do it and stop

6382.48 --> 6387.839999999999
like postponing it for a decade

6389.28 --> 6392.719
i need to think like i'm a freaking

6391.28 --> 6396.199
government and government

6392.719 --> 6400.0
send emails and [ __ ] official

6396.199 --> 6403.5199999999995
inquiries and just get it out

6400.0 --> 6405.199
there actually do it more than just this

6403.52 --> 6408.96
show and the flat earth debates

6405.199 --> 6408.96
actually doing that

6411.04 --> 6416.639
and i freaking i freaking need to email

6413.52 --> 6416.639
owen benjamin then

6423.6 --> 6430.2390000000005
although yeah i i wouldn't be able to

6427.199 --> 6432.4
really do it in like a a bear story

6430.239 --> 6434.799999999999
format i don't even have

6432.4 --> 6436.5599999999995
dude i i can't i don't think i could do

6434.8 --> 6438.8
i don't i'm not even qualified to do

6436.56 --> 6438.8
that

6440.639 --> 6446.88
it's just gonna glance through it and

6443.84 --> 6446.88
then just delete it

6449.84 --> 6453.4400000000005
can't believe government bureaucracy is

6452.159 --> 6456.799999999999
motivated you know i

6453.44 --> 6460.0
hate it it's just that

6456.8 --> 6463.1990000000005
i need to reach out through

6460.0 --> 6466.239
email something i literally never

6463.199 --> 6469.5199999999995
do ever

6466.239 --> 6472.4
i avoid it because i hate like

6469.52 --> 6474.88
doing that sort of thing and i shouldn't

6472.4 --> 6474.879999999999
hate it

6483.44 --> 6487.839999999999

i have to have like literally i can

6523.119 --> 6527.44
barely break anybody open from talking

6525.52 --> 6527.92
and then as soon as i get somebody i'm

6527.44 --> 6529.919999999999
talking

6527.92 --> 6541.84
with them then suddenly you get the

6529.92 --> 6541.84
waterfall of conversation

6580.84 --> 6583.84
so

6597.36 --> 6611.839999999999
wow chimney

6600.96 --> 6611.84

does that mean

6639.119 --> 6642.48
expand my show what do an extra hour you

6641.92 --> 6645.52

6642.48 --> 6646.08
three hour what are we in live streaming

[ __ ]

6646.08 --> 6651.119
four hours a day what

6649.36 --> 6653.839999999999
what am i supposed to do with all that

6651.119 --> 6653.839999999999
time

6673.04 --> 6677.28
depend by having guests well you gotta

6676.56 --> 6680.080000000001
then have

6677.28 --> 6680.5599999999995
actually guests that are there and show

6680.08 --> 6683.44
up

6680.56 --> 6686.320000000001
in time and not just like oh was it

6683.44 --> 6690.719
three hours ago oh

6686.32 --> 6694.239
right i did try having guests on like

6690.719 --> 6696.4800000000005
the first 200 episodes

6694.239 --> 6697.598999999999
and then it just turned out that they

6696.48 --> 6709.839999999999
constantly

6697.599 --> 6709.84
didn't show up

6720.84 --> 6723.84
what

6734.84 --> 6737.84

uh

6776.0 --> 6785.199
uh chimney on the dustbin idiot

6780.4 --> 6785.199
if it's in freefall then it's displacing

6785.599 --> 6791.84
yeah duh it's not gonna

6789.04 --> 6792.4
order itself in the normal density

6791.84 --> 6794.56
layers

6792.4 --> 6796.08
if it is literally in the middle of

6794.56 --> 6799.119000000001
displacing

6796.08 --> 6804.0
right a sub compartment

6799.119 --> 6804.0
displacing yeah that works differently

6804.32 --> 6809.04
right doesn't disprove relative density

6810.48 --> 6813.5199999999995
there's no change in the surrounding yes

6813.119 --> 6820.5599999999995
there

6813.52 --> 6824.88
is the [ __ ] it's

6820.56 --> 6824.88
literally in the middle of motioning

6836.639 --> 6841.52
being subjected by turbulence oh chimney

6959.84 --> 6962.719
people

6960.32 --> 6965.119
in a chat and they they are basically

6962.719 --> 6967.679
there just to nag the people in the chat

6965.119 --> 6968.48
and not actually be part of the show and

6967.679 --> 6972.639
just bump

6968.48 --> 6974.159
into those people right get a big bit of

6972.639 --> 6976.88
back and forth no they're just

6974.159 --> 6978.638999999999
there to troll and so they don't even

6976.88 --> 6981.1990000000005
listen the show that means they're

6978.639 --> 6982.400000000001
just specifically there to nag the

6981.199 --> 6989.839999999999
people in chat

6982.4 --> 6989.839999999999

7094.239 --> 7101.44
what are you talking about is ranty

7097.84 --> 7104.400000000001
no way

7101.44 --> 7106.719
we got a history together it's not gonna

7104.4 --> 7106.719
happen

7108.639 --> 7115.84
hello chris berry by the way

7122.8 --> 7130.88
right i'm gonna run out the show

7128.48 --> 7132.638999999999
it's been a little better than i

7130.88 --> 7135.92
expected

7132.639 --> 7139.679
at least i got some maneuvers to make it

7135.92 --> 7142.4800000000005
was nice kind of having kneel on

7139.679 --> 7143.119
so the next time i feel like this which

7142.48 --> 7146.4
i guess

7143.119 --> 7149.199
i guess you could say that

7146.4 --> 7150.159
my misery that i felt all this morning

7149.199 --> 7154.08
it's really

7150.159 --> 7156.48
isolation it's like now i'm used to some

7154.08 --> 7157.92
level of isolation i am kind of a hermit

7156.48 --> 7161.28
after all

7157.92 --> 7163.599
but to like actively socially feel

7161.28 --> 7164.48
feel like you're being actively isolated

7163.599 --> 7167.679
that's

7164.48 --> 7171.839999999999
still very terrible it's like the

7167.679 --> 7171.84
sensation of rejection

7171.92 --> 7179.28
right and it lingers on

7175.28 --> 7181.759999999999
so i don't really feel like that

7179.28 --> 7183.04
this much anymore so thank you guys for

7181.76 --> 7186.159000000001
that

7183.04 --> 7186.719
for your input and just your honest

7186.159 --> 7188.48
answers

7186.719 --> 7190.56
because that's really what it's all

7188.48 --> 7193.5199999999995
about it's just the honesty

7190.56 --> 7195.280000000001
right i don't need like a hundred or a

7193.52 --> 7197.360000000001
thousand people that are just

7195.28 --> 7198.8
constantly just sucking up to me

7197.36 --> 7202.639
constantly

7198.8 --> 7206.320000000001
i want the real ideas the real response

7202.639 --> 7209.36
the real opinions even if you think

7206.32 --> 7212.48
that it might hurt me right

7209.36 --> 7215.199
good good let it

7212.48 --> 7215.839999999999
do that right not talking to your trolls

7215.199 --> 7218.0
right

7215.84 --> 7219.52
talking to the real people in my chat

7218.0 --> 7223.36
yeah i want that i

7219.52 --> 7224.400000000001
want you to allow yourself to

7223.36 --> 7228.159
potentially

7224.4 --> 7231.598999999999
punish me for the better

7228.159 --> 7235.36
because that's what honesty is sometimes

7231.599 --> 7239.4400000000005
right it actually hurts me

7235.36 --> 7242.88
more if you hold back

7239.44 --> 7246.239
on your opinions your honest creative

7242.88 --> 7249.52
personal well thought through opinions

7246.239 --> 7252.839999999999
because you don't trust me to handle it

7249.52 --> 7256.719
that hurts me more than people

7252.84 --> 7256.719
trolling right

7262.8 --> 7266.4800000000005
i want to be alone by choice not from

7264.8 --> 7270.320000000001
government rule yeah yeah

7266.48 --> 7270.32
yeah richard v yeah

7272.96 --> 7277.199
right true friends aren't sick of fans

7274.639 --> 7277.1990000000005
that's right

7278.0 --> 7285.84
but a lot of people are do get sick and

7281.76 --> 7288.96
because that's happening out there

7285.84 --> 7290.88
sick of fancy is kind of like a new

7288.96 --> 7294.88
social norm in many ways

7290.88 --> 7298.159000000001
because of just the crazy abusive

7294.88 --> 7301.92
system and the culture that that

7298.159 --> 7305.04
also lends itself from that system

7301.92 --> 7307.84
people get a little abusive they like

7305.04 --> 7309.04
get blatantly like i have the power for

7307.84 --> 7311.76
whatever reason

7309.04 --> 7314.32
and then other people suck up to them

7311.76 --> 7316.4800000000005
right so it's become like a habits like

7314.32 --> 7318.48
if you suck up to them then you're not

7316.48 --> 7320.799999999999
going to be isolated and targeted so

7318.48 --> 7324.08
people almost do that by default

7320.8 --> 7328.639
and it's terrible it's a

7324.08 --> 7330.719
terrible influence right it isolates

7328.639 --> 7333.52
you and everybody else even though

7330.719 --> 7335.36
you're in a group you're still isolated

7333.52 --> 7338.4800000000005
because of that because of that

7335.36 --> 7341.759999999999
influence because of that normalization

7338.48 --> 7342.879999999999
of sick of fancy it's a terrible habit

7341.76 --> 7346.08
and it ruins

7342.88 --> 7348.96
a lot of things especially just clear

7346.08 --> 7351.119
clarity and personal development anyway

7348.96 --> 7353.599

7351.119 --> 7354.4

situation

7400.88 --> 7406.639
is not going to improve then

7404.48 --> 7407.598999999999
