wind no Trails yesterday evening it kind

129.72 --> 132.879
of cleared up a

133.68 --> 140.0
lot but then I did notice some Trails

136.64 --> 143.95899999999997
getting left behind at the

140.0 --> 145.04
time that's yesterday evening today not

143.959 --> 150.2
so

145.04 --> 150.2
much so it's looking kind of nice

151.319 --> 157.599
hello Moxy first in

153.959 --> 163.2
chat good to see

157.599 --> 163.2
you it is Wednesday the 19th of June

168.12 --> 172.48000000000002
2024 temperatures 20°

172.959 --> 180.76
C 53% humidity

176.599 --> 183.959
still 4% precipitation there's a little

180.76 --> 183.959
bit of rain somewhere

185.64 --> 191.92
apparently all right that's really

188.84 --> 195.12
nice and it might be this kind of

191.92 --> 197.67999999999998
weather the coming week I believe the

195.12 --> 197.68
predictions

197.72 --> 203.599
here wait what next

200.92 --> 206.0
Tuesday

203.599 --> 209.48
27°

206.0 --> 212.519
wow we might have some halfway decent

209.48 --> 214.56
some here after

212.519 --> 218.64000000000001
all

214.56 --> 218.64000000000001
huh well looking forward to

227.239 --> 231.439
that

228.92 --> 236.23899999999998
right so yeah I had a bit of a late

231.439 --> 239.319
night last night it's also because

236.239 --> 243.0
well Patricia steer and Mark Sergeant

239.319 --> 244.95899999999997
stream again but started at 400 p.m. for

243.0 --> 248.959
my time so or 4:00

244.959 --> 252.599
a.m. so yeah that's like that's just too

248.959 --> 255.159
late but I did like catch what is it the

252.599 --> 257.43899999999996
first 30 minutes or something that was

255.159 --> 257.43899999999996
kind of

260.6 --> 267.04
fun just watching some more of that but

264.8 --> 270.04
yeah I didn't get through the entire two

267.04 --> 270.04
hours

273.44 --> 277.639
they had no technical difficulties this

278.479 --> 281.479
time

283.28 --> 287.63899999999995
although they do seem to have a little

285.72 --> 291.0
bit of a a flow

287.639 --> 293.6
issue but I mean that's not surprising

291.0 --> 297.28
after so

293.6 --> 300.03900000000004
long cuz it takes some time to like uh

297.28 --> 302.55999999999995
play into each other I think that's the

300.039 --> 302.56
way you say

305.039 --> 310.88
it so they yeah still like overt talking

308.8 --> 312.24
each other like slightly and all that

310.88 --> 316.12
but I'm sure they're going to be able to

312.24 --> 317.639
iron that out over the next few episodes

316.12 --> 321.56
but yeah it was a lot of

317.639 --> 321.56
fun Mark's really

325.28 --> 330.08
hyperactive right so there's that

345.4 --> 352.59999999999997
oh there was a new lunch my lunch break

348.44 --> 352.6
upload haven't checked that out

353.44 --> 360.44
yet a quick

356.039 --> 360.44
look oh it's a short

362.88 --> 365.88
okay

373.72 --> 381.08000000000004
uh Quantum Aras your head is qy live

378.16 --> 386.03900000000004
welcoming back

381.08 --> 386.039
roast but yeah I missed that

389.72 --> 392.96000000000004
kind of weird

445.44 --> 448.44
h

450.16 --> 457.759
hello borders boy good to see

454.199 --> 460.199
you managed to raise 2.5k for him yeah

457.759 --> 464.24
apparently well good on

460.199 --> 466.24
him he needed it apparently there's like

464.24 --> 468.72
I did notice like in the donation list

466.24 --> 471.639
there's like a lot of big donations so

468.72 --> 475.52000000000004
he's got some

471.639 --> 478.0
uh fans supporters that have a lot of

475.52 --> 481.44
money available to them

478.0 --> 481.44
apparently good on it

493.8 --> 496.36
right

497.36 --> 500.36
anyhow

501.96 --> 508.75899999999996
H my show yesterday went very well a bit

506.199 --> 510.40000000000003
long I think I'm actually going to like

508.759 --> 513.32
try to cut

510.4 --> 516.36
down length of my show was kind of funny

513.32 --> 521.1590000000001
Owen Benjamin also live yesterday he was

516.36 --> 524.92
talking about like o b

521.159 --> 527.2
o like people watching too much I might

524.92 --> 529.24
have a couple of those people too and

527.2 --> 531.48
they're unfortunately probably all

529.24 --> 536.399
trolls or

531.48 --> 540.16
mostly cuz I mean like almost 4 hours is

536.399 --> 540.16
like it's a bit long

540.88 --> 546.04
now for people that just like to play my

544.16 --> 549.16
videos in the background while they're

546.04 --> 552.04
like working on stuff or whatever I mean

549.16 --> 554.1999999999999
it's not going to be a problem for them

552.04 --> 554.1999999999999
I

557.92 --> 561.64
think but uh

565.839 --> 573.519
yeah I should try to come P My overall

570.72 --> 573.519
show a bit

574.32 --> 577.519
more I

585.32 --> 590.88
think right but yeah sometimes when you

588.64 --> 592.399
got a good subject it's very hard to

590.88 --> 595.64
like let

592.399 --> 598.92
go and so did I yesterday I thought that

595.64 --> 598.92
my insight

599.72 --> 605.9200000000001
about the Bones from the catacombs were

602.44 --> 607.0400000000001
very good I thought that was actually a

605.92 --> 609.7199999999999
really good

607.04 --> 610.8389999999999
Insight wonder if other people have

609.72 --> 613.839
thought of

610.839 --> 613.839
that

615.36 --> 621.9590000000001
before and yeah consider it my

618.72 --> 621.9590000000001
contribution to that

624.92 --> 631.959
field I don't see a lot of people

627.279 --> 631.959
actually asking like hey who's bones are

635.32 --> 640.6
those and of course there is no real

638.639 --> 642.2
information about any of

640.6 --> 646.72
them

642.2 --> 646.72
right so then like

647.44 --> 655.48
yeah are they tartarians I mean it it

651.12 --> 655.48
seems logical that they are

662.16 --> 667.8
right anyway don't forget to share the

663.92 --> 667.8
stream and Rogan's it

671.88 --> 676.639
up if you got any questions maybe about

675.56 --> 680.279
Flat

676.639 --> 685.36
Earth or about the tartaria stuff then

680.279 --> 685.36
by all means ask them in my chat

699.2 --> 703.76
I still have to wake up a little bit

704.8 --> 709.4399999999999
more it's a good thing I got some tar

707.44 --> 713.9200000000001
coffee

709.44 --> 716.9200000000001
here and of course good old Illuminati

713.92 --> 716.92
croissant

729.399 --> 733.56
all right close

736.68 --> 743.56
this all right and hey if everybody

740.12 --> 746.519
chooses not to show up in the chat or

743.56 --> 748.7199999999999
just say hello and that's it well it's

746.519 --> 749.88
super nice weather so then I'll just

748.72 --> 752.0
like

749.88 --> 755.279
take a step outside

752.0 --> 757.88
maybe have a smoke or something and just

755.279 --> 759.72
enjoy the weather if people are not

757.88 --> 761.519
going to show up in my chat so that

759.72 --> 764.44
that's going to be my tactic for today

761.519 --> 767.68
and how to deal with

764.44 --> 769.6
that but I mean yeah there might be not

767.68 --> 774.88
so many people watching as they were

769.6 --> 774.88
watching Patricia steer yesterday night

779.76 --> 784.6
which Just DE Mark Sergeant I mean a lot

781.839 --> 786.0400000000001
of people did actually watch that show

784.6 --> 792.48
but it was a lot of

786.04 --> 796.4399999999999
fun very fluid nobody ever shut up at a

792.48 --> 796.44
second so yeah that's

797.279 --> 803.56
a probably a bit more entertaining than

800.12 --> 806.36
my show to most and that's just

803.56 --> 808.1199999999999
perfectly fine it's the hazard of the

806.36 --> 813.04
early bird

808.12 --> 813.04
show just one guy sitting there

816.88 --> 821.56
talking right but yeah that's why my

819.36 --> 824.0790000000001
night night owl shows seem to be a lot

821.56 --> 825.3199999999999
more successful and there will be more

824.079 --> 828.3199999999999
night owl

825.32 --> 828.32
shows

828.959 --> 836.5999999999999
definitely and uh I probably have Crow

832.36 --> 836.6
trip 7 on somewhere

856.079 --> 861.3199999999999
probably in July 3rd of

865.88 --> 871.04
July what is it 11: a.m. eastern time

875.519 --> 880.399
I forgot to respond to that H should

877.839 --> 880.399
definitely

892.36 --> 900.1990000000001
respond

895.16 --> 900.199
H okay that would be at 5:00

902.68 --> 906.68

958.959 --> 961.959
e

1017.839 --> 1021.8800000000001
uh e

1080.0 --> 1084.159

2127.0 --> 2131.119
you mean the real world of

2131.56 --> 2138.24
delusion of Perpetual nonsense delusion

2135.16 --> 2141.0
the fair tale world of

2138.24 --> 2142.24
bardia oh there will always be a fairy

2141.0 --> 2146.04
tale world of

2142.24 --> 2149.839
bardia there that you will never go to

2146.04 --> 2153.319
yeah cuz they told lots of fairy tales

2149.839 --> 2156.16
in the past too yeah they did also

2153.319 --> 2159.04
actually tell their children like yeah

2156.16 --> 2160.2799999999997
you you can't actually go go there it's

2159.04 --> 2164.8
just a

2160.28 --> 2166.8390000000004
story right the only difference now with

2164.8 --> 2169.96
back in the past what they told children

2166.839 --> 2172.96
and then what NASA and

2169.96 --> 2175.8
bardia wizards tell

2172.96 --> 2180.119
you they tell you you can go there

2175.8 --> 2183.6800000000003
you're just never ever going to go there

2180.119 --> 2186.1600000000003
ever you're going to have your CGI

2183.68 --> 2189.8799999999997
Representatives that are going to go for

2186.16 --> 2192.8799999999997
you you will never

2189.88 --> 2192.88
go

2195.72 --> 2202.359
yeah but I'm sure you're all going to

2198.2 --> 2205.52
die at a ripe old age knowing that you

2202.359 --> 2210.44
never went but you always believe that

2205.52 --> 2210.44
someday you would I know you

2212.52 --> 2216.52
do right

2220.119 --> 2222.96
I don't want to

2223.4 --> 2228.6800000000003
go I don't either I mean who the hell

2226.119 --> 2231.2400000000002
would want to go to a virtual nonsense

2228.68 --> 2231.24
place like

2237.56 --> 2243.72
that interesting on interested in my

2240.76 --> 2246.88
views on Iran okay what exactly Danny

2243.72 --> 2248.68
shakes about Iran are you interested in

2246.88 --> 2251.2400000000002
I mean I haven't like really talk that

2248.68 --> 2253.64
elaborately about Iran other than it's

2251.24 --> 2258.319
also a nation of Aryans they have the

2253.64 --> 2258.319
redheaded people as do does

2262.56 --> 2267.2799999999997
turkey right Iran has

2272.92 --> 2278.0
arens that's pretty much the extent of

2275.599 --> 2282.92
my knowledge though it's just like yeah

2278.0 --> 2286.52
I know Iran has arens and Hitler was

2282.92 --> 2289.4
interested in Iran because of that too I

2286.52 --> 2291.96
was interested in all these Iran these

2289.4 --> 2291.96
Aryan

2292.76 --> 2296.96
tribes across Europe in the Middle

2299.72 --> 2304.64
East hello Steve windorf

2311.0 --> 2315.4
you would have the Goon to go yeah

2313.44 --> 2318.64
except you don't have the

2315.4 --> 2320.2400000000002
balls cuz there ain't no balls to go to

2318.64 --> 2325.24
there's no balls to come from and

2320.24 --> 2329.5989999999997
there's no ball to go to outer space is

2325.24 --> 2332.04
fake there's nowhere to go but down if

2329.599 --> 2335.599
you want to go up that's cool you're

2332.04 --> 2338.2
going to get down Gonna Get Back Down to

2335.599 --> 2339.119
Earth that's the only place

2338.2 --> 2342.1189999999997
where you

2339.119 --> 2342.119
can

2344.56 --> 2349.319
rest cuz you're not going to float up

2349.68 --> 2354.24
there right unless you want to hang by a

2352.64 --> 2357.7599999999998
be suspended by a

2354.24 --> 2357.7599999999998
balloon it's that

2358.48 --> 2364.64
simple but you can always keep imagining

2362.28 --> 2367.8
like you're making progress I mean

2364.64 --> 2369.8799999999997
certainly the storytelling tradition non

2367.8 --> 2372.48
is making progress

2369.88 --> 2375.359
slightly although if you really think

2372.48 --> 2377.56
about like how much time has been spent

2375.359 --> 2380.119
since they first started to claim that

2377.56 --> 2383.0789999999997
all this nonsense is possible well if

2380.119 --> 2385.359
you take that into account then really

2383.079 --> 2386.599
the amount of progress that you've made

2385.359 --> 2389.16
is

2386.599 --> 2392.92
absolutely

2389.16 --> 2392.92
abysmal absolutely

2395.2 --> 2401.7599999999998
abysmal right even techn ically it's

2398.359 --> 2405.24
abysmal things

2401.76 --> 2407.5600000000004
that have been F

2405.24 --> 2409.4399999999996
like figured

2407.56 --> 2412.2799999999997
out

2409.44 --> 2415.319
envisioned through science fiction on

2412.28 --> 2418.28
what you could have done like 60 years

2415.319 --> 2420.92
ago and none of that has even been

2418.28 --> 2425.6400000000003
remotely been

2420.92 --> 2428.96
realized so yeah no progress whatsoever

2425.64 --> 2432.839
it's the most un

2428.96 --> 2435.079
Progressive research development sector

2432.839 --> 2435.0789999999997
there

2435.92 --> 2441.52
is like every industry has made

2438.76 --> 2444.5600000000004
developments except the space

2441.52 --> 2447.44
industry has not had any developments

2444.56 --> 2449.0
whatsoever perhaps trickery developments

2447.44 --> 2452.04
but yeah that's not part of what they're

2449.0 --> 2454.52
going to tell you right no aren't there

2452.04 --> 2458.04
supposed to be like technological

2454.52 --> 2462.16
developments because of the space in the

2458.04 --> 2462.16
yeah well guess what there aren't

2462.72 --> 2469.0789999999997
any like they just isn't I mean

2466.76 --> 2471.28
sometimes they like to claim that oh we

2469.079 --> 2475.0
had some technological development that

2471.28 --> 2477.4
we made because of this thing we did

2475.0 --> 2479.28
except no they just had the

2477.4 --> 2481.0
technological development and then they

2479.28 --> 2484.0400000000004
just said oh that's because of that

2481.0 --> 2485.24
stupid launch there or whatever that's

2484.04 --> 2488.48
not

2485.24 --> 2491.0789999999997
real right you got to pick some

2488.48 --> 2493.64
development success on this supposed

2491.079 --> 2496.96
nonsense space program so that

2493.64 --> 2500.16
people that still believe in that hor

2496.96 --> 2504.48
[ __ ] still think like there is some kind

2500.16 --> 2504.48
of constructive purpose to all that

2504.56 --> 2510.4
delusion right so they have to actively

2507.28 --> 2513.8
tell you oh no we're actually doing

2510.4 --> 2518.4
something it's real or we make progress

2513.8 --> 2520.2400000000002
because of this hor [ __ ] that we keep

2518.4 --> 2523.2400000000002
dangling in front of your nose like a

2520.24 --> 2523.24
carrot in front of a

2526.68 --> 2531.16
donkey you love the Netherlands oh

2537.28 --> 2540.599
okay I guess you get all over the place

2539.8 --> 2545.6400000000003
Danny

2540.599 --> 2545.6400000000003
Shakes as a welder is not surprising

2560.48 --> 2565.119
there's nothing left to learn anymore

2563.48 --> 2567.839
akumu virus

2565.119 --> 2570.119
a it's all been discovered it's all been

2567.839 --> 2573.24
figured out there's no more exploration

2570.119 --> 2576.7200000000003
necessary it's all it's all figured out

2573.24 --> 2578.9199999999996
it's so depressing right that we figured

2576.72 --> 2582.52
everything out we've mastered the

2578.92 --> 2584.48
universe now now we have no more purpose

2582.52 --> 2587.8
not that you actually figured anything

2584.48 --> 2590.599
out or went anywhere or proved

2587.8 --> 2592.599
anything but you could definitely keep

2590.599 --> 2594.839
yourself in the illusion like you're the

2592.599 --> 2599.559
master of the universe now now that you

2594.839 --> 2599.5589999999997
believe in this absolute hor [ __ ] called

2604.24 --> 2610.1189999999997
heliocentrism I took it out of context a

2607.96 --> 2613.119
I took it out of

2610.119 --> 2613.119
context

2618.359 --> 2625.04
no Black Swan isn't going

2622.04 --> 2625.04
any

2630.319 --> 2636.2799999999997
what are are you

2633.68 --> 2639.359
anthropomorphizing a devastating Flat

2636.28 --> 2642.7200000000003
Earth argument against the globe are you

2639.359 --> 2644.96
an proring that argument

2642.72 --> 2647.2799999999997
now I mean that's that's a good

2644.96 --> 2651.0
distraction maneuver right if you just

2647.28 --> 2654.2400000000002
personify this Black Swan into like some

2651.0 --> 2657.68
kind of mythical thing instead of the

2654.24 --> 2660.0
hardcore argument that absolutely

2657.68 --> 2662.72
destroy any notion that the Earth might

2660.0 --> 2665.319
have some kind of curvature to

2662.72 --> 2667.68
it yeah I

2665.319 --> 2670.04
anthropomorphize that devast stating

2667.68 --> 2671.319
argument against my religion as well if

2670.04 --> 2673.52
I weree

2671.319 --> 2675.44
Ballwin that way you could just mention

2673.52 --> 2678.04
it and then just wave it off it's like

2675.44 --> 2680.88
oh the black swarm hot so oh it's not

2678.04 --> 2683.96
going anywhere though and then you can

2680.88 --> 2686.44
just like it's encapsulated with your

2683.96 --> 2688.8
delusion so that you don't have to think

2686.44 --> 2691.16
of it as that actual devastating

2688.8 --> 2693.2400000000002
argument to your Globe faith and you

2691.16 --> 2695.2799999999997
just put it away because it's not going

2693.24 --> 2698.64
anywhere because now it's an object it's

2695.28 --> 2702.119
a creature somehow that devastating

2698.64 --> 2702.1189999999997
argument against your Globe

2717.559 --> 2724.7200000000003
model right I mean all you had to do is

2722.16 --> 2728.24
may lay the claim

2724.72 --> 2729.72
oh look at that hand oh you think it's

2728.24 --> 2735.4399999999996
there no it's

2729.72 --> 2738.4399999999996
not it's slightly bent around the

2735.44 --> 2741.44
curve visually so that it's not actually

2738.44 --> 2743.88
where you're seeing it and that way you

2741.44 --> 2747.64
can think that you can still live on a

2743.88 --> 2752.2000000000003
ball even though everything is so

2747.64 --> 2755.16
flat right you know the Earth is a ball

2752.2 --> 2758.3999999999996
because it's measured flat yeah that

2755.16 --> 2761.96
direction I know how this works

2758.4 --> 2766.0
guys I know what you do inside of your

2761.96 --> 2769.2400000000002
head whether you lay it down or not I

2766.0 --> 2769.24
know exactly how this

2775.68 --> 2782.96
works so keep rolling out the smiley

2778.599 --> 2786.1600000000003
emoticons I mean I would do that too

2782.96 --> 2787.8
right like an embarrassment smile

2786.16 --> 2790.319
because you're are

2787.8 --> 2792.48
stuck and your Consciousness can't

2790.319 --> 2795.2
really move on from that Vantage Point

2792.48 --> 2798.16
yeah i' I'd roll out stupid trollish

2795.2 --> 2798.16
little smilees

2806.119 --> 2811.7200000000003
too gas pressure requires a container

2809.359 --> 2814.5989999999997
yeah but not if you just think of gas

2811.72 --> 2817.9599999999996
pressure as something

2814.599 --> 2819.3590000000004
different right Dany shakes if you just

2817.96 --> 2822.92
calculate

2819.359 --> 2826.839
it like it's not gas pressure but it's

2822.92 --> 2828.8
just a layer of fluid well then you can

2826.839 --> 2830.359
have the gas pressure just sit right

2828.8 --> 2834.079
next to a

2830.359 --> 2837.64
vacuum look outside measure the gradient

2834.079 --> 2841.52
and that's your proof it is possible

2837.64 --> 2843.96
now who cares about gas pressure laws

2841.52 --> 2847.48
right who cares about oh wait a gas

2843.96 --> 2849.559
pressure gradient can only set in if the

2847.48 --> 2853.119
gas pressure has been contained in order

2849.559 --> 2856.0400000000004
to form that gradient within the

2853.119 --> 2858.52
container could just ignore all of that

2856.04 --> 2861.4
right and just think that oh no it's

2858.52 --> 2863.52
just the vacuum right next to it really

2861.4 --> 2868.04
big vacuum sitting right next to it and

2863.52 --> 2868.04
it's all fine everything is

2875.4 --> 2879.92
fine water level requires a

2878.4 --> 2883.92
container

2879.92 --> 2885.559
uh well water requires a container yeah

2883.92 --> 2888.16
if you want to have water you're going

2885.559 --> 2891.2000000000003
to have to have the like the Goldilocks

2888.16 --> 2893.52
zone pressure

2891.2 --> 2896.16
situation yeah and I'm stealing that

2893.52 --> 2898.68
from heliocentric

2896.16 --> 2900.44
myth you're going to have to have Goldie

2898.68 --> 2903.72
Locks level

2900.44 --> 2907.96
pressures which require a container in

2903.72 --> 2912.0789999999997
order to have water be in a stable liqu

2907.96 --> 2915.04
liquid form and find its

2912.079 --> 2918.2000000000003
level if

2915.04 --> 2919.88
there's not enough pressure then the

2918.2 --> 2923.0789999999997
water's going to evaporate and then you

2919.88 --> 2926.52
have no water at the form level isn't

2923.079 --> 2926.52
that just special

2952.04 --> 2957.079
oh look at that the barded cereal

2963.559 --> 2971.6800000000003
projection I love for you to be right

2967.48 --> 2973.599
and make the news yes oh a flat Earth

2971.68 --> 2977.24
are being right is going to mean he's

2973.599 --> 2981.3590000000004
going to make the news that's how that

2977.24 --> 2981.359
works yes of

2985.799 --> 2991.16
course and I'm sure jiren and wited are

2989.04 --> 2994.48
going to make the

2991.16 --> 2996.92
news when they prove there's no 24-hour

2994.48 --> 2998.559
sun in Antarctica I'm sure they're going

2996.92 --> 3001.48
to make the

2998.559 --> 3004.079
headlines

3001.48 --> 3006.48
yes cuz that's how that works in this

3004.079 --> 3006.48
world

3008.559 --> 3015.599
right just like oh Trump won the

3012.44 --> 3018.799
elections with a landslide I'm sure the

3015.599 --> 3022.76
media's going to give it to him well

3018.799 --> 3024.44
Trump won fair and square I'm sure

3022.76 --> 3027.6400000000003
that's going to

3024.44 --> 3031.599
happen yes cuz that that's how that

3027.64 --> 3034.799
works in this world right oh a flat

3031.599 --> 3037.3590000000004
earther W an argument against a glober

3034.799 --> 3040.319
I'm sure it's going to make the

3037.359 --> 3045.319
news

3040.319 --> 3050.52
yes I'm a Ballard I'm so realistic about

3045.319 --> 3050.52
how things work in this world yes

3068.559 --> 3077.559
they should have picked Oakley or k to

3072.48 --> 3081.44
go uh who's to say that they

3077.559 --> 3083.96
were even wanting to go

3081.44 --> 3087.359
there and what the hell does it matter

3083.96 --> 3089.4
whether somebody who believes in ether

3087.359 --> 3092.04
goes there or not it's completely

3089.4 --> 3095.6800000000003
irrelevant in fact it technically

3092.04 --> 3095.68
doesn't matter who goes there at

3097.079 --> 3101.2400000000002
all the only thing they're going even

4024.039 --> 4030.2000000000003
communist propaganda

4026.44 --> 4032.64
cucks that's exactly what you are you

4030.2 --> 4035.64
don't know anything about your past at

4032.64 --> 4035.64
all

4053.64 --> 4056.2
hey Richard

4056.4 --> 4061.799
G you your mother went through a lot of

4059.119 --> 4066.359
the BS yeah I bet she did I bet she went

4061.799 --> 4068.92
through the early stage communist

4066.359 --> 4073.72
programming

4068.92 --> 4073.7200000000003
yeah I'm sure she did

4076.359 --> 4080.48
right but what nobody talks about is

4078.24 --> 4083.0389999999998
that in the early 20th century the black

4080.48 --> 4085.2400000000002
community was actually doing great they

4083.039 --> 4087.4
were doing

4085.24 --> 4091.2
fantastic

4087.4 --> 4094.48
yeah they were crushing it then the

4091.2 --> 4098.239
victim narrative start programming

4094.48 --> 4100.359
started and look at you now yeah not

4098.239 --> 4102.839
doing so great

4100.359 --> 4107.2390000000005
HH yeah just look at the average

4102.839 --> 4110.359
homicide rid look at how many black dads

4107.239 --> 4113.799
actually stay home to raise their kids

4110.359 --> 4116.799
yeah compared to the

4113.799 --> 4116.799
920s

4119.199 --> 4125.239
H

4121.56 --> 4132.120000000001
yeah and and you actually believing that

4125.239 --> 4132.12
slavery means black people it's pathetic

4136.199 --> 4141.719
no Steve wif don't be a

4139.12 --> 4144.64
[ __ ] Asians were slaves Irish were

4141.719 --> 4144.64
slaves there you

4146.239 --> 4153.08
go not the same ways as blacks yeah

4150.04 --> 4157.64
because they would actually do work so

4153.08 --> 4157.64
they'd be put to work way more

4168.12 --> 4172.5599999999995
yeah but uh I'll leave it to Owen

4170.64 --> 4174.799
Benjamin to talk about that I'm sure

4172.56 --> 4178.04
he's going to bring it up on the stream

4174.799 --> 4180.56
today since you're saying it is

4178.04 --> 4181.799
juneth I'm sure he's going to roll all

4180.56 --> 4186.159000000001
of this

4181.799 --> 4189.239
out but seriously black people you think

4186.159 --> 4192.879999999999
that this is all about you I'm I'm sure

4189.239 --> 4195.839999999999
you do I'm sure you think it's all about

4192.88 --> 4198.52
you poor old you poor

4195.84 --> 4198.52
ancestors

4205.32 --> 4210.799999999999
you blacks were treated as property

4208.32 --> 4215.639999999999
bought and sold yeah and who started

4210.8 --> 4215.64
that exactly who started

4216.199 --> 4220.799999999999
that I think that kind of started in

4219.08 --> 4224.76
Africa didn't

4220.8 --> 4226.360000000001
it oh yeah yeah that's other black

4224.76 --> 4230.76
people

4226.36 --> 4230.759999999999
that started that yeah I

4238.36 --> 4241.88
remember hey Steven

4243.56 --> 4247.96
Jarvis what is wrong with life today

4246.08 --> 4251.5199999999995
nothing is

4247.96 --> 4253.64
wrong except people let dumbass

4251.52 --> 4256.280000000001
communist programming get to them so

4253.64 --> 4259.679
they have a male formed picture of the

4256.28 --> 4263.28
past now in the past everything

4259.679 --> 4266.0
bad in their minds even though provably

4263.28 --> 4269.0
the present is way

4266.0 --> 4269.0
worse

4273.239 --> 4276.599999999999
provably like

4277.8 --> 4283.92
statistically but I mean yeah it's very

4281.92 --> 4286.4
tough right to to face how things

4283.92 --> 4288.28
actually get worse and then your

4286.4 --> 4290.08
condition no everything is better now

4288.28 --> 4292.679
the past was

4290.08 --> 4294.679
bad oh look we're just going to like

4292.679 --> 4298.12
over simplify the way you're going to

4294.679 --> 4302.0
look at the past so you could say past

4298.12 --> 4305.28
bad yeah make it easy on you I know how

4302.0 --> 4305.28
this goes

4319.0 --> 4324.08
oh juneth is about the blacks oh

4339.639 --> 4345.52
okay what the [ __ ] is wrong with me I

4342.28 --> 4349.599999999999
don't know nothing's wrong with me

4345.52 --> 4351.679
I didn't know you had like specific

4349.6 --> 4356.0
racist

4351.679 --> 4356.0
holidays but they you were better than

4360.84 --> 4366.400000000001
that I thought it was about slavery but

4363.639 --> 4369.76
I guess it was just all about blacks po

4366.4 --> 4372.839999999999
All Blacks right that sounds like a

4369.76 --> 4372.84
racist holiday to

4373.04 --> 4381.84
me yeah I mean where's White day where's

4377.88 --> 4381.84
white slave owner day

4383.0 --> 4391.32
then I want a white slave owner day to

4387.239 --> 4395.839999999999
remember how we used to actually manage

4391.32 --> 4395.84
things and make it work

4406.96 --> 4413.44
what days every day oh yes I'm sure sure

4410.52 --> 4413.4400000000005
we're doing so

4414.0 --> 4419.639
great right cuz oh everything is on

4417.32 --> 4423.12
roses if you're white it's just great I

4419.639 --> 4426.639
mean you just get continually barraged

4423.12 --> 4430.12
and discriminated against and it's all

4426.639 --> 4433.8
cool but I mean yeah whites are

4430.12 --> 4436.28
not slave ment don't have that slave

4433.8 --> 4439.0
mentality as much so they tend to like

4436.28 --> 4441.5199999999995
not complain about everything to all

4439.0 --> 4444.719
hell until people start to beg them

4441.52 --> 4447.400000000001
please please stop complaining about it

4444.719 --> 4450.08
we'll give you anything just please stop

4447.4 --> 4452.638999999999
whining like a [ __ ] about it please for

4450.08 --> 4454.96
the love of God yeah no whites aren't

4452.639 --> 4454.96
like

4458.84 --> 4466.12
that on average I mean it's not perfect

4462.679 --> 4466.12
there are some

4491.239 --> 4494.239
m

4505.56 --> 4511.1990000000005
think I've ever heard me once complain

4508.36 --> 4514.599999999999
no I do complain sometimes definitely

4511.199 --> 4517.879999999999
especially about people not showing

4514.6 --> 4517.88
up that's

4521.8 --> 4527.4400000000005
tedious right but then again I'm not

4524.56 --> 4530.56
perfect white now am

4527.44 --> 4533.678999999999
I so in that sense I'm excused and I

4530.56 --> 4536.76
mean I don't even know what this trainer

4533.679 --> 4540.4800000000005
thought is about I'm just dissing yeah

4536.76 --> 4545.96
because I think that this racist type

4540.48 --> 4545.959999999999
of remembrance is just ridiculous

4573.48 --> 4576.759999999999
hello LSG good to see

4595.719 --> 4602.2390000000005
say I thought it was mostly Anglo Saxon

4599.0 --> 4602.239
but whatever

4637.28 --> 4644.599999999999
a Jewish oh you're Jewish oh wow what

4640.84 --> 4644.6
have foreseen that

4662.08 --> 4665.239
no wonder you're so

4673.6 --> 4681.96
invested no no Moxy no you didn't yeah

4678.44 --> 4685.919999999999
we don't originate from

4681.96 --> 4685.92
Africa that's hor

4692.679 --> 4698.32
[ __ ] yeah I'm sure you're going to tell

4695.239 --> 4705.28
me next that Jesus was black too yeah

4698.32 --> 4705.28
yeah no how about no absolute nonsense

4706.12 --> 4710.08
yeah see I knew it this is all just a

4708.28 --> 4713.36
bunch of horeshit why don't you all just

4710.08 --> 4717.76
[ __ ] off yeah Jesus is a ginger it was

4713.36 --> 4721.04
not black or African like the concept of

4717.76 --> 4723.719
African doesn't didn't even

4721.04 --> 4725.36
exist like what he was from the

4723.719 --> 4728.12
continent of

4725.36 --> 4733.08
Africa oh really so that means he's

4728.12 --> 4733.08
black what a bunch of [ __ ]

4734.96 --> 4739.92
Ginger that's right yeah not

4742.56 --> 4748.92
black originated from Africa Middle East

4745.639 --> 4751.92
yeah yeah yeah Ginger yeah just like the

4748.92 --> 4757.0
ginger in Iran and the ginger in turkey

4751.92 --> 4761.84
and the gingers in Egypt yeah Ginger not

4757.0 --> 4765.08
black yeah gingers ruled

4761.84 --> 4769.88
you cuz they were good at it they

4765.08 --> 4769.88
actually managed and did a fine

4772.8 --> 4777.52
job African doesn't mean black that's

4778.36 --> 4784.839999999999
right like the Vikings Now Vikings

4781.92 --> 4789.159
didn't really care much for that sort of

4784.84 --> 4791.96
stuff Vikings didn't really enslave

4789.159 --> 4795.12
anybody they just procreated with them

4791.96 --> 4799.199
or killed them

4795.12 --> 4799.199
they were not much of slave owners

4807.12 --> 4814.84
type Africans are the most guilty of

4810.0 --> 4819.04
slavery yeah specifically the black

4814.84 --> 4823.12
Africans yeah black Africans are the

4819.04 --> 4825.239
most guilty of slavery that's right they

4823.12 --> 4826.08
effectively invented it

4825.239 --> 4829.28
they

4826.08 --> 4832.5199999999995
basically started up international

4829.28 --> 4836.759999999999
market for the first time with countries

4832.52 --> 4841.639
outside of their own continent like hey

4836.76 --> 4844.56
you got stuff for trade well I got black

4841.639 --> 4847.96
slaves I know that's weird right yeah we

4844.56 --> 4850.56
just trade humans off yeah I know you

4847.96 --> 4852.84
don't do that you got like all entur

4850.56 --> 4855.080000000001
servitude and all that like people get

4852.84 --> 4858.0
in debt they have to work yeah well here

4855.08 --> 4861.5599999999995
we just own people like Commodities and

4858.0 --> 4866.8
we're ready to trade them yeah yeah they

4861.56 --> 4871.4400000000005
started it yeah black Africans started

4866.8 --> 4875.4800000000005
slave slave trade they started it of

4871.44 --> 4877.96
course the Jews got in there like oh

4875.48 --> 4880.04
business yeah new markets I mean can you

4877.96 --> 4882.159
blame them it's a new market they got to

4880.04 --> 4886.56
do it they got to do it yeah yeah yeah

4882.159 --> 4886.5599999999995
but the blacks they started it

4888.28 --> 4896.759999999999
yeah it's all you all of

4892.159 --> 4899.679
it you started that you the blacks

4896.76 --> 4902.679
started to use other blacks as

4899.679 --> 4907.159
Commodities that you could own and trade

4902.679 --> 4911.4
for trinkets you invented that yeah the

4907.159 --> 4914.759999999999
other racist didn't even think of trying

4911.4 --> 4918.199
to do anything like that because it's so

4914.76 --> 4919.719
natural to treat your fellow humans like

4918.199 --> 4923.239
their piece of

4919.719 --> 4926.08
furniture yeah only the [ __ ]

4923.239 --> 4929.759999999999
nobility of Europe and all that [ __ ]

4926.08 --> 4932.96
these psychos they might do

4929.76 --> 4936.280000000001
that right and everybody hated them for

4932.96 --> 4940.08
it so it wasn't just a common practice

4936.28 --> 4943.36
no no but black Africans definitely like

4940.08 --> 4946.04
brought that idea to the general

4943.36 --> 4949.159
public and and now suddenly it's like oh

4946.04 --> 4952.4
wait we can just own

4949.159 --> 4955.96
blacks like slaves like pieces of

4952.4 --> 4958.199
furniture huh okay blacks thanks for

4955.96 --> 4961.6
giving us that suggestion that we can

4958.199 --> 4963.839999999999
just own you like Commodities thanks I

4961.6 --> 4967.679
guess we'll do that

4963.84 --> 4970.400000000001
now right that's how that happened yeah

4967.679 --> 4972.76
that's how that started yeah why he

4970.4 --> 4974.599999999999
didn't come in and like oo there's too

4972.76 --> 4977.52
many blacks over there I think we're

4974.6 --> 4979.2390000000005
going to have to enslave them no no no

4977.52 --> 4982.040000000001
they didn't even think of trying to do

4979.239 --> 4986.159
anything like that no you blacks came to

4982.04 --> 4990.08
us and say hey you want to trade black

4986.159 --> 4994.28
man yeah that's how that started huh

4990.08 --> 4994.28
yeah can we be clear about

4995.76 --> 5002.1990000000005
that who built the Pyramid

4999.199 --> 5005.08
slaves

5002.199 --> 5009.0
right yeah black

5005.08 --> 5010.92
built the pyramids oh yes I'm sure they

5009.0 --> 5013.679
did

5010.92 --> 5014.92
right I bet you have tons of evidence

5013.679 --> 5019.28
for

5014.92 --> 5019.28
that no you don't

5036.84 --> 5044.96
no no slays were necessary in the

5039.92 --> 5044.96
Assembly of the pyramids that's absolute

5047.239 --> 5052.799999999999
nonsense right so everybody's properly

5049.92 --> 5056.679
triggered and informed right the perfect

5052.8 --> 5061.08
combination cuz yeah hey being informed

5056.679 --> 5061.08
about reality it's very

5062.4 --> 5069.199
triggering who built that

5065.92 --> 5072.96
uh not black

5069.199 --> 5072.96
slaves I know that

5074.08 --> 5079.92
much Giants built them

5077.0 --> 5082.28
maybe but I'm pretty damn sure that

5079.92 --> 5085.719
black slaves did not build the pyramids

5082.28 --> 5088.0
under any conceivable condition or model

5085.719 --> 5088.0
about

5088.119 --> 5096.36
it dude it would never work all they do

5092.04 --> 5098.88
is just whine and complain all day

5096.36 --> 5101.639
long and try to get in bed with the

5098.88 --> 5105.719
pharaoh's daughters and all that [ __ ]

5101.639 --> 5105.719
you know how that goes it's never

5106.36 --> 5109.36
work

5112.36 --> 5119.28
never they had 3D building printers

5115.719 --> 5119.28
maybe they did

5128.52 --> 5134.96
yeah but maybe if the pyramids were

5131.56 --> 5137.8
actually constructed with

5134.96 --> 5140.199
cotton maybe then the blacks could have

5137.8 --> 5142.88
like built it as slaves because then

5140.199 --> 5143.96
they would actually be able to finish

5142.88 --> 5147.2390000000005
the

5143.96 --> 5149.6
task and not just go into protest over

5147.239 --> 5151.28
all those damn Stones being so heavy

5149.6 --> 5154.119000000001
because if they were coton well then

5151.28 --> 5156.239
they wouldn't really complain about it

5154.119 --> 5156.239
right

5169.44 --> 5174.32
someone in here told me blocks in the

5171.719 --> 5176.119
pyramids were molded yeah that's right

5174.32 --> 5180.599999999999
that's the most

5176.119 --> 5185.04
likely they were cast not molded but

5180.6 --> 5188.4400000000005
cast poured like concrete except GE

5185.04 --> 5193.08
polymer which turns into like permanent

5188.44 --> 5193.08
Rock once it's solidified

5200.96 --> 5207.56
yeah concrete yeah except not chemical

5204.88 --> 5210.400000000001
concrete because concrete is toxic and

5207.56 --> 5211.96
sucks and it dtif over

5210.4 --> 5215.759999999999
time

5211.96 --> 5219.44
geopolymer is the real thing it when you

5215.76 --> 5223.2390000000005
when it solidifies it becomes stone

5219.44 --> 5223.239
stone that literally lasts

5226.719 --> 5234.119
forever it's the building technique

5230.6 --> 5236.679
that's been withheld from

5234.119 --> 5240.679
Humanity for as long as anybody can

5236.679 --> 5243.119
remember it's it's the big secret from

5240.679 --> 5244.92
the Freemasons I mean it's probably

5243.119 --> 5247.759999999999
their primary

5244.92 --> 5251.4800000000005
secret is

5247.76 --> 5256.08
geopolymer cu it is still known how to

5251.48 --> 5260.239
do it it's just not open to the general

5256.08 --> 5263.32
public or corporations to use

5260.239 --> 5265.638999999999
it I think you have to have like special

5263.32 --> 5267.28
permission to to actually have

5265.639 --> 5271.719
geopolymer

5267.28 --> 5271.719
structures at this point

5287.36 --> 5293.799999999999
yeah Winston I know yeah slave comes

5290.32 --> 5297.48
from Slavic people because they were

5293.8 --> 5301.04
enslaved yeah but I mean black people of

5297.48 --> 5304.119
course have to then make slavery

5301.04 --> 5305.679
exclusively about them because some

5304.119 --> 5307.119
somebody thought that they would make

5305.679 --> 5309.28
good cotton

5307.119 --> 5312.119
Pickers and now they're still

5309.28 --> 5312.119
complaining about

5312.96 --> 5316.96
it right

5357.679 --> 5363.32
nobody says blacks were the only slaves

5359.719 --> 5366.639
yeah but yet you have a Remembrance Day

5363.32 --> 5369.92
specific about slavery of black people

5366.639 --> 5373.56
though so yeah maybe nobody says blacks

5369.92 --> 5377.159
are the only slaves but it's certainly

5373.56 --> 5380.280000000001
suggested huh within your

5377.159 --> 5383.638999999999
holidays right I mean that's literally

5380.28 --> 5383.639
what you said

5418.36 --> 5424.32
right ah good for you Shan yeah no you

5421.48 --> 5426.879999999999
shouldn't you shouldn't celebrate any of

5424.32 --> 5426.88
nonsense

5438.96 --> 5444.28
holidays your great great great grandpa

5441.4 --> 5448.239
was a slave give me money dude all of

5444.28 --> 5451.04
our grand Grandparents were slaves

5448.239 --> 5455.32
pretty much all of them it's very rare

5451.04 --> 5458.159
that you don't have any kind a Slave at

5455.32 --> 5458.159
some point in your

5465.639 --> 5473.679
family yeah I mean officially pretty

5470.159 --> 5477.48
much all whites all of them all whites

5473.679 --> 5479.92
in Europe were slaves all of them except

5477.48 --> 5484.678999999999
the [ __ ]

5479.92 --> 5487.8
nobility yeah it's called peons

5484.679 --> 5487.8
it's called

5488.0 --> 5493.76
feudalism everyone was slaves everyone

5494.76 --> 5501.119000000001
yeah and I tell you that those people in

5498.76 --> 5503.159000000001
the medieval times if any of that was

5501.119 --> 5504.759999999999
even literally as they say was I mean

5503.159 --> 5506.4
that's kind of like around the time of

5504.76 --> 5510.6
tartaria so

5506.4 --> 5514.32
it's whatever it is how it is said is

5510.6 --> 5518.2390000000005
that yeah I mean Europeans in time of

5514.32 --> 5522.599999999999
feudalism were treated way

5518.239 --> 5524.759999999999
worse than any post Renaissance slaves

5522.6 --> 5527.320000000001
were in the United States

5524.76 --> 5530.56
okay and not saying that there weren't

5527.32 --> 5533.639
any brutalities

5530.56 --> 5538.2390000000005
happening in that time frame but I mean

5533.639 --> 5540.679
Medieval Times is literally

5538.239 --> 5543.0
notorious for how

5540.679 --> 5544.4800000000005
terrible people were treated and

5543.0 --> 5549.28
punished

5544.48 --> 5552.638999999999
notorious for it horrendous

5549.28 --> 5554.759999999999
spectacles horrendous torture like

5552.639 --> 5558.8
public torture

5554.76 --> 5561.159000000001
yeah but I mean oh but my great great

5558.8 --> 5563.360000000001
great great great R got hung in off a

5561.159 --> 5566.159
tree you got hung off a tree you got

5563.36 --> 5569.48
tortured off a tree oh no yeah dude

5566.159 --> 5572.199
that's nothing that's

5569.48 --> 5574.839999999999
absolutely like being tickled to death

5572.199 --> 5576.96
with a feather kind of treat compared to

5574.84 --> 5580.56
the [ __ ] that people went through in

5576.96 --> 5580.56
medieval times in Europe

5600.0 --> 5605.52
okay trans atletic slave trade was

5602.92 --> 5608.08
[ __ ] up yeah Winston I

5605.52 --> 5611.080000000001
know or you could just say think of it

5608.08 --> 5611.08
as being very

5616.28 --> 5623.28
efficient nah sorry that's too far no it

5619.76 --> 5623.280000000001
was brutal I I get

5626.04 --> 5634.239
it I mean leave it to the blacks to

5630.239 --> 5638.36
start selling their own skin color as

5634.239 --> 5642.08
ofes right but then leave it to the Jew

5638.36 --> 5644.679
to figure out how to transport them

5642.08 --> 5644.679
super

5644.76 --> 5649.96
efficiently right am I

5647.92 --> 5653.08
right I

5649.96 --> 5656.8
mean a a black guy would

5653.08 --> 5660.0
not have concocted like that

5656.8 --> 5662.1990000000005
transatlantic slave trade like that like

5660.0 --> 5665.0
only a Jew could figure out something

5662.199 --> 5668.0
like that

5665.0 --> 5670.719
but hey blacks definitely started

5668.0 --> 5674.679
trading other blacks like

5670.719 --> 5674.679
Commodities that's all on

5683.679 --> 5688.679
them right but even during that time

5686.32 --> 5692.44
there were still plenty of indentured

5688.679 --> 5695.639
slaves from Ireland and all

5692.44 --> 5695.638999999999
that right

5708.96 --> 5714.92
white Christian slaves you were forced

5710.92 --> 5716.679
to R till death was yeah now G slaves

5714.92 --> 5719.28
are

5716.679 --> 5724.28
horrible that's

5719.28 --> 5726.28
right yeah like slaves were used in

5724.28 --> 5730.44
sea Warfare

5726.28 --> 5730.44
too and those were mostly

5731.28 --> 5736.28
whites yeah just during sea Warfare it

5734.48 --> 5739.36
just like yeah they just have a bunch of

5736.28 --> 5741.88
people chained to in a row chain to the

5739.36 --> 5744.04
boat in a rowing station and just row

5741.88 --> 5747.04
until the ship goes down and then

5744.04 --> 5750.36
everybody drowns those were mostly

5747.04 --> 5750.36
slaves white

5751.6 --> 5755.639
slaves pretty terrible

5763.36 --> 5769.88
right you see us complaining about

5766.28 --> 5769.88
it where's our

5775.04 --> 5782.92
reparations now we we don't want any

5777.76 --> 5786.0
reparations because we realized like hm

5782.92 --> 5788.4
tough times make strong men well maybe

5786.0 --> 5791.08
if we just accept the tough times then

5788.4 --> 5792.719

description box below

5965.119 --> 5971.759999999999
that's right clutch yeah that's why I

5967.84 --> 5975.32
said like blacks from the

5971.76 --> 5979.4800000000005
920s were way better oh yeah they were

5975.32 --> 5982.599
poor sure they were yeah but daddy did

5979.48 --> 5986.759999999999
not leave the house

5982.599 --> 5988.159000000001
yeah when them kids are born they stay

5986.76 --> 5993.2390000000005
at

5988.159 --> 5993.239
home they re that kids

5993.48 --> 5996.36
yeah look at them

6016.719 --> 6024.679
now you don't see many going back to

6020.0 --> 6027.679
Africa dude it gr n it's nuts because

6024.679 --> 6029.639
like the blacks are like in America that

6027.679 --> 6032.36
are complaining about slavery they've

6029.639 --> 6034.96
never known slavery

6032.36 --> 6037.159
ever like their parents didn't even know

6034.96 --> 6039.52
slavery maybe their grandparents a

6037.159 --> 6042.08
little bit or they just lived in

6039.52 --> 6044.56
slightly economically tougher times and

6042.08 --> 6047.32
they had to manage and and even they

6044.56 --> 6047.320000000001
probably weren't

6049.44 --> 6056.119
slaves you know why because I think that

6053.44 --> 6058.32
most actual black slaves from the

6056.119 --> 6062.598999999999
colonial American

6058.32 --> 6065.199
days they all eventually got turned into

6062.599 --> 6068.08
citizens and then they prospered

6065.199 --> 6072.199
enormously and they're like rich black

6068.08 --> 6074.199
people rich black people uh they don't

6072.199 --> 6077.919999999999
complain about

6074.199 --> 6083.36
reparations you know why because they're

6077.92 --> 6086.4800000000005
rich they actually succeeded in life

6083.36 --> 6090.36
they lifted themselves out of poverty

6086.48 --> 6092.678999999999
through Labor that started with slavery

6090.36 --> 6095.239
no it's the blacks that don't have any

6092.679 --> 6097.32
slaves in their family that just

6095.239 --> 6098.959999999999
complain and whine all day long how

6097.32 --> 6100.88
they're supposed to be getting

6098.96 --> 6106.719
reparations for something that never

6100.88 --> 6106.719
even happened to them yeah that's the

6111.88 --> 6118.32
problem right no nobody talks about oh

6114.96 --> 6122.0
slavery slavery Colonial slavery they

6118.32 --> 6124.599
treated the black so bad uh yeah and the

6122.0 --> 6126.719
blacks that actually managed to like

6124.599 --> 6130.04
somewhat behave

6126.719 --> 6133.88
normally and just do the job yeah a lot

6130.04 --> 6136.639
of them did just have families as a

6133.88 --> 6139.0
slave and it worked great and they took

6136.639 --> 6142.119
care of their kids and then eventually

6139.0 --> 6143.719
they'd even be able to get their freedom

6142.119 --> 6148.44
and become citizens

6143.719 --> 6150.92
and like have actual paid jobs and and

6148.44 --> 6154.119
businesses and they thrived and they

6150.92 --> 6159.32
became wealthy because of their labor

6154.119 --> 6159.32
yeah nobody talks about that

6164.08 --> 6170.08
right no it's just them poor black man

6167.8 --> 6172.76
the poor black man that got treated

6170.08 --> 6175.04
badly as a slave yeah well maybe that's

6172.76 --> 6179.08
because they [ __ ] misbehaved all the

6175.04 --> 6179.08
time they didn't just do their

6179.28 --> 6183.639
work yeah if you complain all the time

6182.119 --> 6185.119
you don't do your work yeah you're going

6183.639 --> 6187.8
to get punished you're never going to

6185.119 --> 6190.839999999999
get rich plenty of black people that

6187.8 --> 6192.52
just did the work and then they got

6190.84 --> 6194.92
their freedom and then they could start

6192.52 --> 6197.4400000000005
a business and then they became wealthy

6194.92 --> 6200.08
and now they don't complain about

6197.44 --> 6202.5599999999995
reparations because they know that

6200.08 --> 6204.0
because of their ancestors going through

6202.56 --> 6206.8
that

6204.0 --> 6206.8
they're now

6207.599 --> 6211.599
wealthy yeah

6242.639 --> 6250.36
there's [ __ ] methods white stealing

6246.04 --> 6253.44
copper so own Benjamin says I don't I

6250.36 --> 6253.44
never met one

6262.04 --> 6266.08
though for

6295.48 --> 6299.04
right so anyway glad to be able to make

6298.199 --> 6302.32
my

6299.04 --> 6304.56
points yeah I'm not super invested I'm

6302.32 --> 6307.48
just relaying the

6304.56 --> 6311.679
lore just telling

6307.48 --> 6313.28
you yeah all them black folk complaining

6311.679 --> 6317.4800000000005
about

6313.28 --> 6319.639
slavery reparations to slavery well I

6317.48 --> 6322.44
don't think they had any slavery in

6319.639 --> 6324.88
their family ever they just had a lot of

6322.44 --> 6328.08
lazy people that learned that if you

6324.88 --> 6331.52
complain about being treated badly

6328.08 --> 6334.44
allegedly that people would be easily

6331.52 --> 6336.96
shamed into like giving you compensation

6334.44 --> 6340.839999999999
for something that never happened and I

6336.96 --> 6340.84
think that that's really what's

6351.44 --> 6356.5599999999995
happening it's like

6353.56 --> 6356.56
reparations

6359.52 --> 6366.040000000001
industry the [ __ ] is that horrible

6361.76 --> 6369.4400000000005
accent yeah get deal with it

6366.04 --> 6372.4
dude my accent is whatever it is

6369.44 --> 6376.159
whatever I feel like in the moment and

6372.4 --> 6376.159
that's the way it is

6388.36 --> 6393.598999999999
is that supposed to be a Southern accent

6391.239 --> 6395.839999999999
maybe maybe that's what I'm trying I

6393.599 --> 6398.28
don't know what I'm trying I'm not super

6395.84 --> 6400.8
conscious about when I do voices you

6398.28 --> 6402.84
might have noticed I just do voices

6400.8 --> 6407.320000000001
sometimes people think like what are you

6402.84 --> 6409.719
trying to insult me like uh maybe I

6407.32 --> 6412.679
don't know I'm just doing a

6409.719 --> 6416.159
voice does that mean you're sarcastic no

6412.679 --> 6416.159
it just means I'm doing a

6420.239 --> 6425.959999999999
voice I just do voices randomly it just

6426.4 --> 6433.28
happens trust me if I intend to insult

6430.0 --> 6433.28
you you will be

6434.719 --> 6440.8
insulted yeah no no need to figure out

6438.8 --> 6443.400000000001
whether you're supposed to be insulted

6440.8 --> 6447.04
or not if you need to figure that out

6443.4 --> 6450.199
then you probably weren't

6447.04 --> 6451.92
insulted if I intend to insult somebody

6450.199 --> 6453.759999999999
you're going to be insulted you're not

out

7410.48 --> 7413.799999999999
facts is

7414.96 --> 7421.599
gaslighting that's how that

7418.04 --> 7421.599
works if you're

7430.719 --> 7433.719
delusional

7460.719 --> 7464.679

7522.239 --> 7527.558999999999
there just let it sit let it sink in

7525.84 --> 7530.4800000000005
like a turet that you're not going to

7725.239 --> 7734.558999999999
around here wasting my time accusing

7729.639 --> 7737.400000000001
me yeah trying to write their delusions

7734.559 --> 7740.52
over me try to make me repeat their

7737.4 --> 7744.96
delusions and not paying me for

7740.52 --> 7746.639
it yeah I want some reparations for me

7744.96 --> 7750.159
doing my

7746.639 --> 7753.76
show and having to endure you

7750.159 --> 7755.96
lot you ever thought of that I'm just

7753.76 --> 7758.92
sitting here and I have to endure you

7755.96 --> 7762.4800000000005
because you're not supporting me yeah

7758.92 --> 7762.4800000000005
where's my reparations

7769.96 --> 7775.28
yeah but then again I'm not I can't

7772.679 --> 7776.8
really complain about it because then

7775.28 --> 7778.559
I'll just end up with a culture of

7776.8 --> 7782.0
indentured

7778.559 --> 7787.0
servitude but uh yeah I mean you guys do

7782.0 --> 7787.0
just hang around for free here

7808.159 --> 7815.239
I said quietly typing then you turn up

7811.04 --> 7815.239
yeah and this is the subject you turn up

7818.559 --> 7823.360000000001
with I mean I would have been fine if

7820.92 --> 7825.119
you did didn't turn up and didn't bring

7823.36 --> 7826.679
that subject and then I would have just

7825.119 --> 7831.32
talked about something

7826.679 --> 7831.32
else yeah I don't owe you

7849.159 --> 7857.598999999999
anything can your

7852.32 --> 7857.599
content uh yeah I'm sure I can green

7859.76 --> 7865.2390000000005
Dy sure I could just take all everything

7863.04 --> 7867.719
that I do I could just take it

7865.239 --> 7870.239
offline and just say like yeah if you

7867.719 --> 7875.52
want to see anything of

7870.239 --> 7875.5199999999995
mine that'll be like 500

7882.4 --> 7888.879999999999
probably more like 10 bucks but uh yeah

7886.639 --> 7891.119
I'm not doing that I am throwing it out

7888.88 --> 7891.119
for

7892.92 --> 7899.4400000000005
free and it is what it is but I mean

7895.44 --> 7899.44
it's not going to really last that long

7900.96 --> 7908.4
because I'm kind of sick of it I'm kind

7903.48 --> 7911.32
of sick of dealing with freeb people out

7908.4 --> 7913.199
there and not other people showing up

7911.32 --> 7915.799999999999
it's just a bunch of free bees and

7913.199 --> 7918.719
trolls and it's kind of

7915.8 --> 7921.599
sucks it kind of really

7918.719 --> 7923.719
sucks and I feel like I'm wasting my

7921.599 --> 7927.92
time I feel like I'm a teacher that

7923.719 --> 7930.36
shows up in class and no interested

7927.92 --> 7931.679
people actually show up nobody actually

7930.36 --> 7934.36
comes to

7931.679 --> 7937.599
learn it's just people that have a lot

7934.36 --> 7939.799999999999
of time to waste they come hang around

7937.599 --> 7943.84
and then they think that they own the

7939.8 --> 7943.84
place and I'm kind of sick of

7952.84 --> 7958.639
it that's ridiculous auma virus if I am

7956.679 --> 7962.92
something that you have to endure then

7958.639 --> 7962.92
what the [ __ ] are you doing here

7964.32 --> 7972.079
[ __ ] who says you have to endure

7968.599 --> 7974.599
me if you don't like watching me then

7972.079 --> 7974.599
[ __ ]

7999.199 --> 8005.159
off wow Ste J of it that's ridiculous I

8002.559 --> 8007.92
kind of doubt it but whatever man he can

8005.159 --> 8007.92
do whatever he

8009.199 --> 8015.199
wants you get tons of money for your

8012.36 --> 8018.5199999999995
stuff then you do that you can just be

8015.199 --> 8021.079
rich and be happy and not be [ __ ]

8018.52 --> 8024.0
poor barely getting by and just having a

8021.079 --> 8026.159
bunch of trolls and whiny freebie people

8024.0 --> 8028.32
hang around you and complain to you all

8026.159 --> 8030.36
day long and waste your goddamn time and

8028.32 --> 8032.5199999999995
never give a straight answer to a good

8030.36 --> 8035.119
question

8032.52 --> 8037.52
and not make any money and can barely

8035.119 --> 8041.36
update your own

8037.52 --> 8041.360000000001
clothing yeah that's my

8042.76 --> 8049.0
life so I bet they're all just doing

8045.84 --> 8051.28
great just tons and tons of money all

8049.0 --> 8051.28
the

8051.36 --> 8055.799999999999
time maybe it's because he's what the

8053.92 --> 8058.96
[ __ ] does this appearance have to do

8055.8 --> 8058.96
with anything

8066.559 --> 8071.52
benefit of a monetized channel yeah well

8068.96 --> 8074.52
when my channel was monetized I barely

8071.52 --> 8078.92
got anything out of it even though I got

8074.52 --> 8083.079000000001
tons of watching hours just didn't bring

8078.92 --> 8085.88
up anything cuz YouTube does not want to

8083.079 --> 8089.799999999999
pay me they want me to be

8085.88 --> 8093.36
poor and I'm probably going to leave

8089.8 --> 8093.360000000001
them let some

8114.199 --> 8122.5199999999995
point cuz YouTube's given me a lot of

8117.52 --> 8126.040000000001
Hassle and like bugs and Shadow Banning

8122.52 --> 8129.360000000001
[ __ ] and I don't know why they didn't

8126.04 --> 8131.96
just delete my channel

8129.36 --> 8134.88
like that's the weirdest part it's like

8131.96 --> 8139.159
why didn't you just delete my

8134.88 --> 8139.159000000001
channel like with so many other

8139.32 --> 8142.799999999999
people I don't get

8143.679 --> 8150.36
it but maybe they didn't do that because

8147.32 --> 8152.639
I probably would have then moved on and

8150.36 --> 8155.558999999999
been in a much better position if I

8152.639 --> 8155.559
hadn't stuck to

8179.36 --> 8187.598999999999
YouTube being huls oh sure Anton sure oh

8185.84 --> 8190.96
you know it so

8187.599 --> 8191.84
well yeah viral contagion yeah yeah hey

8190.96 --> 8196.399
hey

8191.84 --> 8197.719000000001
Anon what's a virus show me the evidence

8196.399 --> 8200.199999999999
of a

8197.719 --> 8203.96
virus yeah and while you're at it why'

8200.2 --> 8207.479000000001
you lay down how it is established

8203.96 --> 8211.839999999998
huh I'm I'm sure viral contagion is a

8207.479 --> 8215.76
much better more feasible Theory

8211.84 --> 8219.439
then sympathic resonance which is

8215.76 --> 8219.439
basically very

8221.399 --> 8227.84
straightforward you just keep saying

8224.479 --> 8230.8
nuh no yeah you go with your mainstream

8227.84 --> 8233.599
medical [ __ ] yeah you take the

8230.8 --> 8235.719
medical experimentations you take it and

8233.599 --> 8240.439
you shove it up your

8235.719 --> 8242.839999999998
ass huh you deep dived into oh yeah sure

8240.439 --> 8242.84
you did

8251.679 --> 8257.12
yeah H how about the existence of virus

8254.16 --> 8259.719
yeah you put it in a dichotomy yeah you

8257.12 --> 8262.399000000001
you put it in a dichotomy

8259.719 --> 8266.598999999998
right and you said

8262.399 --> 8271.439
oh sympathic resonance is is nonsense oh

8266.599 --> 8275.479
really so you you think that

8271.439 --> 8280.12
viral contagion has any

8275.479 --> 8282.559
legitimacy any legitimacy whatsoever

8280.12 --> 8289.439
then to the point where you're going to

8282.559 --> 8293.438999999998
put sympathic resonance under viral

8289.439 --> 8293.439
contagion right

8313.84 --> 8319.28
why are you assuming you didn't because

8315.679 --> 8321.960000000001
that's what you said he said I did a bit

8319.28 --> 8324.559000000001
of a deep dive into sympathic resonance

8321.96 --> 8328.039999999999
as opposed to viral contagion and the

8324.559 --> 8332.358999999999
entire concept being a

8328.04 --> 8334.800000000001
hoax on behalf of you and I think it was

8332.359 --> 8334.800000000001
clutch

8338.679 --> 8343.599
recommendation you deep dived into

8340.84 --> 8343.599
sympathic

8345.679 --> 8353.84
resonance okay were you agreeing with me

8351.16 --> 8356.719
then maybe it's the way you wrote it

8353.84 --> 8359.719000000001
down just kind of stuck the sentences

8356.719 --> 8359.719
together

8362.8 --> 8367.639
but uh yeah I mean viral contagion

8365.479 --> 8370.358999999999
doesn't exist because viruses don't

8367.639 --> 8373.479
exist and sympathic resonance well

8370.359 --> 8375.719000000001
that's just based on what's experienced

8373.479 --> 8375.719
what's

8389.64 --> 8393.68
happening for

8432.08 --> 8437.64
okay but yeah Anon I mean that's what

8435.359 --> 8440.52
I'm just in this mood cuz I'm just

8437.64 --> 8442.8
hanging around with [ __ ] Moxy and

8440.52 --> 8446.359
kumu virus who I kind of just want to

8442.8 --> 8446.358999999999
kick out at this

8448.2 --> 8454.880000000001
point cuz you're being extremely

8451.64 --> 8457.119999999999
tedious just whiny and [ __ ] and oh

8454.88 --> 8460.0
look at how [ __ ] Rich we

8457.12 --> 8463.6
are

8460.0 --> 8463.6
yeah why would that

8469.72 --> 8476.16
be cuz it's all my fault right nobody

8474.12 --> 8477.240000000002
wants to watch my show I'm not going to

8476.16 --> 8480.6
get

8477.24 --> 8483.88
rich I only get the trolls that hate me

8480.6 --> 8488.04
all the time so I get all the complaints

8483.88 --> 8488.039999999999
and I don't get any money

8514.88 --> 8519.039999999999
right but I'm sure that there's going to

8516.72 --> 8522.64
be plenty of troll comments telling me

8519.04 --> 8525.640000000001
Oh Arwin why don't you just get a job

8522.64 --> 8528.96
right cuz that's new that's not like

8525.64 --> 8532.8
that's ever been told to me like a

8528.96 --> 8534.759999999998
100,000 times by similar shitty trolls

8532.8 --> 8537.358999999999
because I mean yeah I'm only having a

8534.76 --> 8540.359
YouTube channel I spent like over 10,000

8537.359 --> 8543.359
hours on it barely make anything out of

8540.359 --> 8546.479000000001
it so then it's not a job right it's not

8543.359 --> 8551.399000000001
a job if you spend over 10,000 hours on

8546.479 --> 8554.72
it and don't make any money

8551.399 --> 8554.72
barely that's

8555.12 --> 8560.800000000001
cool

8557.399 --> 8560.8
right and I

8565.439 --> 8571.2
agree at this point maybe it is better

8568.319 --> 8574.92
to get a really [ __ ] shitty generic

8571.2 --> 8578.16
slave job that's boring as [ __ ] cuz I'd

8574.92 --> 8580.319
literally make more money than trying to

8578.16 --> 8582.56
entertain you a bunch of cheap skates

8580.319 --> 8582.56
out

8583.2 --> 8586.6
there it is

8588.68 --> 8594.56
true oh yeah thanks a lot Moxy well I

8592.08 --> 8598.8
don't need you to tell me anything why

8594.56 --> 8598.8
did you just shut the [ __ ] up

8610.76 --> 8616.68
do whatever you want yeah I will I will

8612.92 --> 8616.68
do whatever I want

8632.6 --> 8639.12
what I want right now is to round out

8635.0 --> 8641.64
the show because it's just you guys just

8639.12 --> 8643.640000000001
you guys whining in my chat I don't want

8641.64 --> 8645.96
to deal with it anymore you're not going

8643.64 --> 8649.68
to go away you think this is all your

8645.96 --> 8652.8
hangout now and nobody else feels like

8649.68 --> 8655.84
jumping in cuz they don't want to end in

8652.8 --> 8659.319
the middle of between you

8655.84 --> 8662.8
guys incessantly whining because now you

8659.319 --> 8665.8
decided that this is just your chat

8662.8 --> 8665.8
now

8667.84 --> 8674.399
yeah right so thanks everyone for coming

8671.0 --> 8677.64
I hope you like this show it's a bit uh

8674.399 --> 8679.479
culturally sensitive probably but if you

8677.64 --> 8682.319
liked it then please don't forget to

8679.479 --> 8684.16
rogans it up and if you haven't already

subscribed to my channel hit the Bell

8684.16 --> 8689.2
notification so you know when I'm going

8686.439 --> 8691.56

time every day and please also do

8691.56 --> 8696.359
support me through the PayPal and the

8693.76 --> 8700.0
patreon that'll be much appreciated and

8696.359 --> 8704.439
yeah any support ever would be fantastic

8700.0 --> 8707.359
right more than just five bucks for

8704.439 --> 8709.319
maybe like an Illuminati s here and

8707.359 --> 8713.359
there it would be nice I mean other

8709.319 --> 8717.039999999999
people have channels that do way less

8713.359 --> 8720.92
hours and they get like $1,500 and all

8717.04 --> 8723.319000000001
that or even more right that's cool but

8720.92 --> 8727.76
uh by all means just let this go to

8723.319 --> 8731.199999999999
waste and I'll leave and then I can't be

8727.76 --> 8734.279
a bad image for Flat Earth anymore with

8731.2 --> 8736.960000000001
all my telling people to kill themselves
