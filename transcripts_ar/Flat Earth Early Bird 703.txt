soon so

91.84 --> 100.07900000000001
yes the weather

96.479 --> 103.28
is very very stormy

100.079 --> 104.79899999999999
it's been storming all night with some

103.28 --> 106.88
weird moments where suddenly

104.799 --> 108.88000000000001
a huge amount of water would drop out of

106.88 --> 110.32
the sky and then after like 10 seconds

108.88 --> 114.079
stop again

110.32 --> 115.19999999999999
so that's that that was last night and

114.079 --> 118.79899999999999
now it's just

115.2 --> 120.159
storming a lot went out for groceries in

118.799 --> 123.36000000000001
this and

120.159 --> 126.799
at least it's not wet it's not so

123.36 --> 126.799
wet but it is kind of cold

127.119 --> 130.879
very stormy and yeah the autumn colors

130.239 --> 134.239
are

130.879 --> 134.239
definitely coming through

138.64 --> 144.79999999999998
yeah but no amazing sunlight like i had

141.76 --> 144.79999999999998
yesterday oh well

149.76 --> 157.84
oh oops

159.84 --> 166.959
voice only on the right side oh dear

163.28 --> 171.12
uh yeah

166.959 --> 174.56
i don't know what to do about it

171.12 --> 177.20000000000002
for some reason it yeah it it kind of

174.56 --> 180.0
divides the sound like that i can like

177.2 --> 182.159
even if i turn around my mic

180.0 --> 184.0
i don't know one side just picks it up

182.159 --> 187.44
better than the other i don't know why

184.0 --> 191.76
sorry about that obermoco anyway

187.44 --> 195.04
was first good servant tom parker

191.76 --> 195.04
good to see you so far

197.44 --> 213.92
ah these are still very awesome

212.0 --> 216.56
well maybe i could try fiddling around

213.92 --> 220.159
with my mic a little

216.56 --> 220.159
hopefully that'll do something

220.56 --> 227.84
something that i actually want all right

228.44 --> 232.539
[Music]

232.72 --> 236.64
i don't know it doesn't seem to be the

234.56 --> 239.2
wiring i can't make sense of why

236.64 --> 241.79
it's asymmetrical and why it wasn't

239.2 --> 244.89999999999998
asymmetrical

241.79 --> 244.9
[Music]

252.1 --> 255.15
[Music]

291.12 --> 297.04
oops yeah yeah yeah

294.72 --> 298.40000000000003
it auto muted when i replugged it in i

297.04 --> 301.44
didn't even notice that

298.4 --> 301.44
first right

301.759 --> 306.24
yeah but i can't get the asymmetrical

304.4 --> 311.84
thing

306.24 --> 311.84000000000003
out i don't know why

312.08 --> 317.039
if i want to change that i'm going to

314.56 --> 317.039
have to

319.52 --> 322.639
basically get somebody that really knows

321.759 --> 327.44
how to

322.639 --> 327.44
deal with obs to help me figure this out

330.16 --> 339.84000000000003
let me try something else hope this

332.32 --> 339.84
doesn't go wrong

349.039 --> 353.84
okay right nope nope

372.44 --> 375.66
[Music]

378.84 --> 381.84
hmm

382.24 --> 386.0
let's see what happens if i do this

389.039 --> 395.84
okay this i'm switching it

396.08 --> 403.75899999999996
right how about this is this better

400.0 --> 406.08
i basically set the balance off

403.759 --> 408.88
of the mic i think it looks more

406.08 --> 411.21
symmetrical now

408.88 --> 412.56
what do you guys think

411.21 --> 417.52
[Music]

412.56 --> 417.52
see it should heighten it up a bit

421.039 --> 426.31899999999996
yo yo yo yo hello

424.86 --> 429.36
[Music]

426.319 --> 432.639
okay this works great actually huh

429.36 --> 435.28000000000003
all right i'll do it like this i'll do

432.639 --> 435.28000000000003
it like this

435.44 --> 437.84
all right

440.8 --> 444.40000000000003
although it does seem a little bit low

442.639 --> 446.479
but i don't know how well the sound is

444.4 --> 448.4
getting through

446.479 --> 450.24
i feel like i have to be louder than

448.4 --> 453.52
normal but

450.24 --> 455.52
what do you guys think glad that that

453.52 --> 459.12
actually paid off that attempt

455.52 --> 462.71999999999997
instead of just wasting all of your time

459.12 --> 465.84000000000003
right anyway hello amanda jung

462.72 --> 465.84000000000003
julio pavin

467.039 --> 479.84
rob el

481.599 --> 486.08
looks even flatter than flat today

487.919 --> 494.87899999999996
check it out when you guys have the time

490.879 --> 494.879
yeah well i yeah i do

495.16 --> 502.16
[Music]

498.08 --> 506.96
right uh yeah yeah let's see i'm afraid

502.16 --> 508.49
yeah i did make notes ha ha

506.96 --> 511.84
uh

508.49 --> 514.8
[Music]

511.84 --> 514.8
i do right

517.279 --> 520.399
yeah and before this show started i was

519.279 --> 523.12
over at uh

520.399 --> 523.12
what is it again

525.12 --> 528.48
it's still live i think

529.04 --> 533.519
yeah miggy over at miggy's flat earth

532.32 --> 537.2
arena

533.519 --> 541.839
because there was this baller in there

537.2 --> 541.839
and he was a full-on believer like

542.16 --> 548.16
yeah really full-on almost like rumpus

545.839 --> 549.12
but he just seemed more recent i don't

548.16 --> 551.92
know it's

549.12 --> 553.68
a new baller and these guys were on to

551.92 --> 556.8
him

553.68 --> 558.88
a lot and neil it was in there

556.8 --> 560.8389999999999
so he's probably not visiting my show

558.88 --> 562.08
today because he's still in there i

560.839 --> 567.0400000000001
think

562.08 --> 567.0400000000001
oh yeah let me check if it's still going

569.839 --> 573.6
if neil's still active in there

575.2 --> 580.88
all right or you could be taking a break

579.12 --> 582.399
anyway i was very active in the chat

580.88 --> 591.8389999999999
there

582.399 --> 591.839
put some good data down

604.079 --> 608.56
right also yeah should yeah make notes

607.6 --> 611.6
before i forget

608.56 --> 612.079
i should damn man i should really really

611.6 --> 616.5600000000001
like

612.079 --> 619.1999999999999
just get a log a log book for this

616.56 --> 619.68
of a proper size because i'm gonna yeah

619.2 --> 624.6400000000001
i'm

619.68 --> 624.64
halfway my note block that was quick

624.959 --> 629.92
uh didn't expect that but yeah yesterday

628.399 --> 633.12
on the flat earth debates

629.92 --> 635.1999999999999
was very typical i i basically

633.12 --> 638.2
referenced a

635.2 --> 639.76
natural news article that was like super

638.2 --> 642.9590000000001
astrophysicist

639.76 --> 646.0
level about black holes i wrote a really

642.959 --> 649.5189999999999
detailed comment in there

646.0 --> 651.44
yeah submitted it and

649.519 --> 652.64
yeah it was smart enough to actually

651.44 --> 655.839
copy it and

652.64 --> 658.079
quote it like in skype

655.839 --> 661.839
because yeah i looked later and they

658.079 --> 661.8389999999999
completely removed my comment

662.88 --> 666.48
but i thought it was a really good

664.32 --> 670.48
comment

666.48 --> 670.48
very confronting about science

671.2 --> 675.23
anybody catch that that was during the

673.44 --> 677.9200000000001
live show

675.23 --> 689.36
[Music]

677.92 --> 703.8389999999999
which was pretty pretty good by the way

689.36 --> 703.839
hey martin tolberg

714.839 --> 717.839
uh

727.6 --> 732.32
yes i'm back good yeah my internet got

730.399 --> 736.0
disrupted

732.32 --> 737.6
only just saw it in time

736.0 --> 739.2
otherwise i would have interrupted the

737.6 --> 742.5600000000001
stream so

739.2 --> 746.72
thank goodness for that hey ron iron

742.56 --> 746.7199999999999
effie let's see you jeff rabborg

755.92 --> 759.68
right but yeah i was going to check out

759.279 --> 762.8
that

759.68 --> 765.519
movie and another series

762.8 --> 768.079
which like historical themed that

765.519 --> 771.12
reminded me a little bit about the

768.079 --> 771.12
the dutch movie

771.2 --> 778.48
about like christianity versus paganism

775.2 --> 780.399
what is his name again i don't know it's

778.48 --> 781.6
it's been a while yeah i could find it

780.399 --> 783.44
back in my notes but

781.6 --> 784.8000000000001
i don't know it's not really relevant

783.44 --> 786.8800000000001
but it's like very

784.8 --> 788.7199999999999
like an old piece and this one's called

786.88 --> 791.12
barbarians and it's between the

788.72 --> 794.639
germanics and the romans

791.12 --> 800.0
so probably gonna be pretty gruesome

794.639 --> 802.0790000000001
action but i'm just curious

800.0 --> 804.1
because i like it when they try

802.079 --> 805.92
something like that

804.1 --> 808.24
[Music]

805.92 --> 809.68
to brace it basically breathe some kind

808.24 --> 814.72
of spiritual

809.68 --> 816.4799999999999
life conception into those barbarians

814.72 --> 817.839
and see what they came up with what they

816.48 --> 819.9200000000001
cross referenced and where

817.839 --> 821.839
it's going to be polluted and grabbed

819.92 --> 824.399
grappled or whether it's

821.839 --> 825.9200000000001
relatively pure and straightforward i

824.399 --> 828.32
don't know

825.92 --> 829.12
because i haven't watched it i just saw

828.32 --> 832.8000000000001
the intro

829.12 --> 835.279
thought hmm okay

832.8 --> 836.7199999999999
that might be interesting so anyway yeah

835.279 --> 838.48
that was pretty much it

836.72 --> 840.5600000000001
other than that just a bunch of games

838.48 --> 840.5600000000001
and

841.12 --> 849.45
the yeah the regular alex jones but

845.68 --> 853.7289999999999
usually don't tend to hang around a lot

849.45 --> 853.729
[Music]

854.839 --> 859.0400000000001
uh

856.079 --> 859.519
right and owen benjamin of course who

859.04 --> 864.88
was

859.519 --> 864.88
by the way also onto movies and series

865.68 --> 870.7199999999999
he was talking about that and yeah from

868.56 --> 873.279
his perspective

870.72 --> 875.36
which was interesting just showing that

873.279 --> 878.32
he he knows

875.36 --> 881.1990000000001
like he is into yeah he is a comedian he

878.32 --> 883.36
is into stage he is into

881.199 --> 884.88
that sort of thing stuff so he gets it

883.36 --> 886.88
he has the

884.88 --> 888.24
the insights for it and it's interesting

886.88 --> 891.92
to hear his

888.24 --> 892.72
his opinions about it and eventually

891.92 --> 895.279
yeah

892.72 --> 896.24
it was more about the moral code of god

895.279 --> 898.399
how that works

896.24 --> 900.9590000000001
very much like what i talk about but

898.399 --> 904.32
again from his

900.959 --> 906.0
from his perspective specifically and of

904.32 --> 908.399
course always

906.0 --> 909.44
going to be on to the whole family

908.399 --> 912.32
situation and

909.44 --> 914.5600000000001
yeah not really in the position to do

912.32 --> 914.5600000000001
that

916.88 --> 926.0
but it can be very inspiring a manual

920.959 --> 931.199
a vowels or avilas

926.0 --> 931.199
do you say that ivy less or avails

931.519 --> 941.839
a files

950.48 --> 954.639
right but yeah it yeah that's pretty

954.079 --> 958.6389999999999
much it

954.639 --> 958.639
so 16 minutes and

962.56 --> 969.8389999999999
i'm open for yeah whatever pretty much

972.27 --> 979.04
[Music]

976.8 --> 982.079
i had some more chicken yesterday

979.04 --> 985.12
basically repeated the same meal

982.079 --> 987.7589999999999
pretty much in the same way and it was

985.12 --> 990.88
good but i do feel that i yeah i've i've

987.759 --> 990.88
got enough of that now

993.759 --> 997.279
a funny thing was that i got a shower i

996.32 --> 1000.5600000000001
got a pretty good

997.279 --> 1002.88
sleep and this morning i just know

1000.56 --> 1004.2399999999999
it was weird man i just noticed like

1002.88 --> 1008.0
holy [ __ ] like

1004.24 --> 1009.199
my hair's grown like measurably it's

1008.0 --> 1012.16
funny because

1009.199 --> 1014.16
usually it doesn't really grow that fast

1012.16 --> 1016.959
but i guess that the combination of the

1014.16 --> 1020.3199999999999
situation really

1016.959 --> 1022.88
gave me a growing boost

1020.32 --> 1024.799
probably yeah due to the specific

1022.88 --> 1027.039
substances in the in all that chicken

1024.799 --> 1030.48
meat and skin

1027.039 --> 1030.48
probably especially the skin

1032.24 --> 1036.319
anyway uh yeah

1037.199 --> 1040.64
so i'm i'm up for talking about yeah

1039.28 --> 1042.559
whatever you guys like

1040.64 --> 1045.6000000000001
whether it's flat earth again i'd have

1042.559 --> 1053.84
to describe details or

1045.6 --> 1053.84
conceptual mediums

1054.24 --> 1062.16
uh yeah somebody sent me

1057.52 --> 1067.28
an email over yeah a video over email

1062.16 --> 1070.3200000000002
rob h seems to do that more often

1067.28 --> 1073.12
and he sent me a video that was kind of

1070.32 --> 1075.52
interesting i guess

1073.12 --> 1075.52
let me

1077.919 --> 1086.0
no that's not what i want major whites

1082.08 --> 1088.799
right okay

1086.0 --> 1091.6
and i've watched now 10 minutes of it

1088.799 --> 1094.48
it's like one hour 70 minutes

1091.6 --> 1095.4399999999998
and this is this is basically stuff that

1094.48 --> 1099.1200000000001
i was

1095.44 --> 1102.16
that was in the back of my mind

1099.12 --> 1106.2399999999998
like 20 years ago a lot so it

1102.16 --> 1109.039
it all does sound very very familiar

1106.24 --> 1112.32
but since yeah even like in the title

1109.039 --> 1116.48
the cia is involved

1112.32 --> 1116.48
i already kind of know what this is

1117.2 --> 1119.6000000000001
hold on

1120.24 --> 1126.799
and i'll share it in chat so as a study

1123.919 --> 1129.6000000000001
piece it would be kind of interesting

1126.799 --> 1130.16
but this is absolutely spin doctoring

1129.6 --> 1132.1599999999999
this

1130.16 --> 1134.039
this is like a pretty powerful put

1132.16 --> 1138.0800000000002
together

1134.039 --> 1141.2
heliocentric based future dooms

1138.08 --> 1143.52
scenario story and it's really

1141.2 --> 1145.679
funny how the the person that does the

1143.52 --> 1149.6
presentation even respond to the

1145.679 --> 1150.16
the original thing because apparently it

1149.6 --> 1152.559
was

1150.16 --> 1153.2
something that was devised by the cia

1152.559 --> 1156.559
and then they

1153.2 --> 1159.039
classified it and the

1156.559 --> 1160.24
the guy in the video says even to that

1159.039 --> 1162.8799999999999
in in a moment of

1160.24 --> 1163.52
clarity in a moment of honesty like yeah

1162.88 --> 1165.6000000000001
yeah

1163.52 --> 1167.44
if they wouldn't have classified it

1165.6 --> 1171.1999999999998
people would have just ignored it as

1167.44 --> 1174.559
just another cia story it's like yeah

1171.2 --> 1179.8400000000001
dude no [ __ ] that

1174.559 --> 1179.84
really stood out to me

1183.12 --> 1190.08
don't do that agm don't do that

1186.72 --> 1190.08
it's not freaking funny

1190.559 --> 1195.36
i don't want that sort of attention i

1193.679 --> 1199.1200000000001
don't want those jokes in here

1195.36 --> 1202.08
i want none of that all right

1199.12 --> 1205.12
i had already freaky situation yesterday

1202.08 --> 1206.96
like somebody added me on skype

1205.12 --> 1208.8799999999999
and i thought oh right this is probably

1206.96 --> 1210.799
just a flat earther

1208.88 --> 1213.0390000000002
they added me on skype and tried to

1210.799 --> 1215.9189999999999
freaking advertise me for

1213.039 --> 1217.44
private webcam sessions like what the

1215.919 --> 1220.72
[ __ ]

1217.44 --> 1222.48
it's like uh i was basically trying to

1220.72 --> 1224.32
be polite

1222.48 --> 1226.96
but didn't really want to engage i was

1224.32 --> 1226.96
like uh

1227.52 --> 1232.96
right okay that's very nice your

1230.96 --> 1234.4
backstory of how you're in college and

1232.96 --> 1237.28
[ __ ] and uh

1234.4 --> 1238.48
i asked you how did you get my address

1237.28 --> 1240.08
didn't respond to it

1238.48 --> 1242.64
and then just say oh i'm going to do

1240.08 --> 1245.9189999999999
this oh i can give you a special invite

1242.64 --> 1245.919
like no thanks

1247.039 --> 1251.28
and after that went silent but

1248.96 --> 1254.08
apparently that happened

1251.28 --> 1254.96
i i don't want that [ __ ] and i get these

1254.08 --> 1258.08
stupid

1254.96 --> 1260.24
freaking troll comments on my shows

1258.08 --> 1260.8799999999999
constantly linking to that sort of [ __ ]

1260.24 --> 1263.36
as well

1260.88 --> 1264.5590000000002
i've really repulses me i keep on

1263.36 --> 1267.1999999999998
reporting them

1264.559 --> 1269.6789999999999
they keep coming back so people are

1267.2 --> 1273.1200000000001
trolling my channel now with

1269.679 --> 1276.3200000000002
like sex website

1273.12 --> 1279.76
online [ __ ] links

1276.32 --> 1283.2
like oh great why isn't this removed

1279.76 --> 1286.559
instantly per default why

1283.2 --> 1287.44
can those things actually show i don't

1286.559 --> 1290.559
get it

1287.44 --> 1291.2
they should be withheld per default by

1290.559 --> 1294.1589999999999
youtube

1291.2 --> 1295.44
as it does with most comments that have

1294.159 --> 1299.5200000000002
links in them

1295.44 --> 1303.28
it automatically reroutes them to

1299.52 --> 1305.6
approval it doesn't do it with this

1303.28 --> 1307.76
why how is that even possible you can

1305.6 --> 1308.799
literally see it linked how can it be

1307.76 --> 1311.44
linked there

1308.799 --> 1312.96
and just be a comment that is instantly

1311.44 --> 1316.0800000000002
seen without approval

1312.96 --> 1318.48
how is this even possible

1316.08 --> 1332.1589999999999
i don't understand it's been going on

1318.48 --> 1335.44
for months now

1332.159 --> 1338.5590000000002
i don't understand how are they not

1335.44 --> 1341.679
automatically put in hold

1338.559 --> 1343.52
moderation approval like with every

1341.679 --> 1345.679
other comments

1343.52 --> 1347.36
that has links in them i don't

1345.679 --> 1359.8500000000001
understand

1347.36 --> 1363.58
how is this possible

1359.85 --> 1363.58
[Music]

1367.84 --> 1372.24
like is some are they are the trolls

1370.24 --> 1375.84
hacking youtube are they hacking the

1372.24 --> 1375.84
moderation system

1383.12 --> 1388.3999999999999
just in general have they figured a way

1386.0 --> 1390.24
how to easily access or have there been

1388.4 --> 1393.039
moderators that have literally just

1390.24 --> 1395.919
given their keys away

1393.039 --> 1396.4
just sold them on the market what the

1395.919 --> 1400.0800000000002
hell

1396.4 --> 1400.0800000000002
is going on here youtube

1400.72 --> 1404.159
have there been employees that have just

1402.72 --> 1406.96
sold

1404.159 --> 1408.159
their moderator keys their access keys

1406.96 --> 1411.1200000000001
to youtube

1408.159 --> 1412.0800000000002
on the on the private market illegally

1411.12 --> 1414.32
of course

1412.08 --> 1416.799
and you just aren't even doing anything

1414.32 --> 1421.039
about it what the hell

1416.799 --> 1421.039
is going on youtube

1426.11 --> 1430.6399999999999
[Music]

1428.32 --> 1431.6
yes chrisberry europe has changed

1430.64 --> 1434.7990000000002
daylight

1431.6 --> 1434.799
saving times that's right

1436.0 --> 1445.84
since sunday

1446.46 --> 1449.539
[Music]

1451.66 --> 1461.919
[Music]

1459.52 --> 1464.96
huh they wait a week yeah that is kind

1461.919 --> 1464.96
of odd chris berry

1465.279 --> 1470.24
it's almost like they're sewing this

1468.32 --> 1470.84
junction on purpose it's just gonna

1470.24 --> 1473.039
cause

1470.84 --> 1474.24
miscommunication errors people are gonna

1473.039 --> 1476.4
be like what

1474.24 --> 1477.84
i'm early or i'm late what's going on

1476.4 --> 1479.76
it's just stupid

1477.84 --> 1482.08
why don't they just do it all at once

1479.76 --> 1483.679
it's ridiculous

1482.08 --> 1487.84
if they're gonna do it then just do it

1483.679 --> 1487.8400000000001
like that

1499.12 --> 1504.3999999999999
right yes iron fv i agree it would be

1502.0 --> 1507.6
more sensible to keep just the time

1504.4 --> 1511.279
perfectly consistent at all times and

1507.6 --> 1515.1999999999998
then adapt the working

1511.279 --> 1518.559
hours and the television programming

1515.2 --> 1522.24
hours based

1518.559 --> 1525.6
on the moment in the year so you just

1522.24 --> 1527.36
move like how

1525.6 --> 1528.8799999999999
late you have to get to work and all

1527.36 --> 1533.12
that to the new

1528.88 --> 1533.1200000000001
time to the new schedule

1533.76 --> 1538.72
that would be much more sensible to hey

1536.72 --> 1540.0
because it's supposed to help for that

1538.72 --> 1542.64
right to move

1540.0 --> 1543.12
that you get more daylight and all that

1542.64 --> 1546.64
that's

1543.12 --> 1548.08
what i was told why it was originally

1546.64 --> 1550.159
i don't know if that's really true by

1548.08 --> 1551.12
now but that was supposed to be the

1550.159 --> 1554.159
reason

1551.12 --> 1554.9599999999998
well if that is it then just move the

1554.159 --> 1558.0
standard

1554.96 --> 1558.0
working hours

1558.72 --> 1563.84
or as a company you just don't give a

1561.679 --> 1565.919
[ __ ] because everybody's working like

1563.84 --> 1568.32
underground anyway then it really

1565.919 --> 1572.64
wouldn't matter

1568.32 --> 1574.32
oh stake money that sounds nice

1572.64 --> 1576.0
thank you julio pappin for the two

1574.32 --> 1578.1589999999999
dollar super chat donation i'll check it

1576.0 --> 1578.159
out

1580.88 --> 1584.24
man i haven't had a real steak in a long

1583.279 --> 1587.6
long time

1584.24 --> 1587.6
probably not gonna get it though but

1588.32 --> 1596.8799999999999
whoa thank you julio pavin

1592.72 --> 1599.84
nice thank you very much for that paypal

1596.88 --> 1599.8400000000001
donation

1600.24 --> 1606.48
that's that's going to help a lot

1603.3 --> 1606.48
[Music]

1606.559 --> 1613.84
that's great thank you man thank you so

1609.44 --> 1613.8400000000001
much for the continual support

1615.6 --> 1619.6789999999999
i think i'm probably going to be able to

1618.08 --> 1622.72
basically

1619.679 --> 1624.0
yeah get some of the debt room out of

1622.72 --> 1625.919
the way again because i did

1624.0 --> 1627.52
basically borrow from my health

1625.919 --> 1629.5200000000002
insurance sort of

1627.52 --> 1631.84
in this case which is very easy to do

1629.52 --> 1635.6
but yeah i do have to pay it back

1631.84 --> 1637.279
or it's going to cost extra so i think

1635.6 --> 1639.36
that i'm now in a position that i can

1637.279 --> 1640.08
actually get some of those old builds

1639.36 --> 1643.039
out of the way

1640.08 --> 1643.039
thank you very much

1643.52 --> 1647.32
things are definitely looking good at

1646.08 --> 1650.32
this moment

1647.32 --> 1655.84
[Music]

1650.32 --> 1655.84
right okay halfway the show

1657.12 --> 1660.9599999999998
all right what was that talking about

1658.72 --> 1664.32
again oh yeah yeah daylight

1660.96 --> 1669.8400000000001
situation right so what i would advise

1664.32 --> 1669.84
is to just keep the time at a consistent

1669.919 --> 1674.48
uh yeah at a consistent setting just

1672.159 --> 1674.48
have

1674.88 --> 1679.5200000000002
the time not move during the year just

1677.84 --> 1683.1999999999998
move

1679.52 --> 1685.6
yeah when the the typical times of the

1683.2 --> 1688.799
programming of tv

1685.6 --> 1690.559
again depending on whether the channel

1688.799 --> 1692.399
agrees to it or not so

1690.559 --> 1694.399
i don't know it might even turn out to

1692.399 --> 1697.4399999999998
be more confusing that way

1694.399 --> 1697.76
if if there's not one universal thing

1697.44 --> 1699.919
for

1697.76 --> 1701.919
say the television because i think that

1699.919 --> 1704.3200000000002
if the television and

1701.919 --> 1706.0
the programming like radio shows

1704.32 --> 1709.279
everything that's going on if that

1706.0 --> 1714.0
moves all at once that's

1709.279 --> 1717.279
basically yeah that's gonna push a lot

1714.0 --> 1717.279
to adapt to it

1717.679 --> 1723.279
you wouldn't have to move the time

1720.799 --> 1724.96
the basically the convention of what the

1723.279 --> 1725.919
current time is supposed to be in that

1724.96 --> 1727.6000000000001
position

1725.919 --> 1729.2
you don't have to move that you could

1727.6 --> 1733.12
just say okay

1729.2 --> 1736.3990000000001
we are moving the schedule in the day

1733.12 --> 1738.32
because the because of the daylight

1736.399 --> 1740.399
situation having changed

1738.32 --> 1742.8799999999999
and this is the the convention based

1740.399 --> 1746.7199999999998
moment that we choose in the year

1742.88 --> 1748.3990000000001
to change that over there right

1746.72 --> 1750.159
and you could have that i don't know

1748.399 --> 1753.84
government regulated because it

1750.159 --> 1753.8400000000001
technically wouldn't affect

1754.559 --> 1759.279
yeah what other countries will see about

1757.76 --> 1761.12
it and all that

1759.279 --> 1762.48
because the time there is still the same

1761.12 --> 1765.039
it's just that their

1762.48 --> 1767.2
opening times or whatever when they're

1765.039 --> 1771.76
available for call centers

1767.2 --> 1773.52
that's gonna move that's just gonna move

1771.76 --> 1775.279
and i guess there would have to be

1773.52 --> 1778.48
information about it

1775.279 --> 1782.0
it's like okay our opening times

1778.48 --> 1785.84
are now winter time which means between

1782.0 --> 1789.039
like 10 and whatever eight instead of

1785.84 --> 1792.08
nine and seven like that

1789.039 --> 1794.559
very easy piece of information

1792.08 --> 1795.36
regular schedule change it's very doable

1794.559 --> 1798.8799999999999
and it would

1795.36 --> 1801.039
prevent a lot of confusion that's my

1798.88 --> 1809.8400000000001
personal opinion about that and i've had

1801.039 --> 1809.84
a long time to think about it

1816.07 --> 1820.559
[Music]

1818.72 --> 1822.0
what year did we just start to adjust

1820.559 --> 1826.559
time i think that was somewhere

1822.0 --> 1829.919
like in the earliest 20th or the 19th

1826.559 --> 1837.36
a late 19th century i think

1829.919 --> 1840.72
jeff rabwork

1837.36 --> 1840.7199999999998
or was it even earlier

1841.2 --> 1847.52
i don't know but it's not that long ago

1844.96 --> 1849.44
i know that for sure

1847.52 --> 1852.1589999999999
to be fair i don't really know that too

1849.44 --> 1852.159
much for sure

1854.0 --> 1857.279
i don't think i've ever looked that

1863.039 --> 1866.72
maybe i can up this maybe this is

1865.279 --> 1879.84
something that's

1866.72 --> 1879.84
doable to google

1890.84 --> 1893.84
oh

1895.919 --> 1902.64
oh nice i actually got it right

1899.679 --> 1906.64
with the first with the first mention it

1902.64 --> 1911.2
was early as 20th century it was 1918.

1906.64 --> 1921.8400000000001
huh not too long after the federal

1911.2 --> 1921.8400000000001
reserve act

1924.64 --> 1927.1200000000001
interesting

1928.08 --> 1932.96
so it's like 102 years ago when they

1930.32 --> 1932.96
started this

1935.76 --> 1941.2
in the united states by the way that's

1937.76 --> 1941.2
that what that's what came up

1941.84 --> 1949.84
because i asked it in english

1954.399 --> 1959.1999999999998
ah in the netherlands it was 1916.

1960.64 --> 1968.0800000000002
all right and now you know because i

1964.399 --> 1969.84
google it but i was

1968.08 --> 1972.24
right about my estimation of the time

1969.84 --> 1972.24
period

1974.96 --> 1991.8400000000001
i love it when i turn out to be right

1977.039 --> 1991.84
and i doubted about it

1996.559 --> 2000.24
but it's even better when i just didn't

1998.24 --> 2000.96
doubt about it and then look it up and

2000.24 --> 2004.72
it turns to be

2000.96 --> 2008.159
right but in this case i had some doubts

2004.72 --> 2008.159
because i've never looked it up before

2009.03 --> 2013.76
[Music]

2011.44 --> 2014.72
although i was probably told at some

2013.76 --> 2017.679
point

2014.72 --> 2019.84
but it was like in a bigger explanation

2017.679 --> 2021.919
and then just that one little factoid

2019.84 --> 2024.6399999999999
just never really stuck to me

2021.919 --> 2033.8400000000001
so like that though that then it becomes

2024.64 --> 2033.8400000000001
really easy to forget

2044.0 --> 2048.48
okay that's the most ridiculous saying

2046.559 --> 2061.839
i've ever heard seeking star wars i

2048.48 --> 2061.839
don't know where you got that one

2072.839 --> 2075.839
okay

2076.219 --> 2079.319
[Music]

2084.24 --> 2089.839
you think it's a i don't know

2090.96 --> 2096.32
oh right it's probably i don't know why

2093.44 --> 2099.52
you had to drag in white man though

2096.32 --> 2099.52
just put me out there

2100.4 --> 2106.079
but are you did you

2103.44 --> 2110.16
imply that the blanket is supposed to be

2106.079 --> 2110.1600000000003
a metaphor for time in this case

2111.52 --> 2116.079
okay although i get it i do find it a

2113.76 --> 2118.2400000000002
really stupid analogy because what guy

2116.079 --> 2120.88
would cut off a piece of a blanket to it

2118.24 --> 2124.0
on the other side and think it's longer

2120.88 --> 2125.76
that's yeah that's just stupid it's

2124.0 --> 2128.16
sorry to say i think it's a stupid

2125.76 --> 2131.119
analogy

2128.16 --> 2133.5989999999997
but i get it though i get what what it's

2131.119 --> 2138.6400000000003
supposed to imply

2133.599 --> 2138.6400000000003
native americans saying all right well

2139.04 --> 2141.92
just being honest

2142.88 --> 2145.839
all right

2148.96 --> 2159.839
yeah it just kind of seems kind of

2151.04 --> 2159.839
racist to me

2161.68 --> 2165.1189999999997
but that's all right i guess

2165.44 --> 2173.839
not you're saying okay

2177.86 --> 2181.59
[Music]

2181.92 --> 2185.359
also it seems kind of weird to me that

2183.52 --> 2186.4
they will use a blanket for such an

2185.359 --> 2188.64
example but

2186.4 --> 2191.04
i don't know man i i think i just don't

2188.64 --> 2194.0789999999997
really get the native american

2191.04 --> 2196.4
like i guess slang culture

2194.079 --> 2198.8
what is it what is it even i don't get

2196.4 --> 2200.96
it i don't get what they do

2198.8 --> 2203.28
i don't understand what it's turned into

2200.96 --> 2203.28
this is

2209.92 --> 2215.04
i think i'm more fascinated with the old

2212.96 --> 2218.88
ways but yeah

2215.04 --> 2221.2799999999997
you know i understand why a lot of

2218.88 --> 2223.839
native americans are not really

2221.28 --> 2229.8390000000004
interested in that so much anymore

2223.839 --> 2229.839
i do understand

2230.91 --> 2235.6299999999997
[Music]

2240.839 --> 2243.839
um

2248.72 --> 2253.2799999999997
they think whites do a lot of stupid

2250.48 --> 2253.28
stuff which we do

2253.92 --> 2261.76
true but then again

2258.32 --> 2266.0
not that stupid but yeah i think there

2261.76 --> 2266.0
is even like this weird history to it

2266.24 --> 2270.0
because i think that let's just say i

2269.68 --> 2273.2
think

2270.0 --> 2273.599
that the level of stupidity certain type

2273.2 --> 2276.56
of

2273.599 --> 2278.56
white folks but yeah that was just not

2276.56 --> 2280.7999999999997
it was not universal as much

2278.56 --> 2282.64
i think that the stupidity would go much

2280.8 --> 2286.48
more dramatic

2282.64 --> 2289.7599999999998
like say in the 19th century

2286.48 --> 2291.2
that certain people would be trying to

2289.76 --> 2294.7200000000003
be ambitious but that had

2291.2 --> 2296.0789999999997
very stupid solutions to things in that

2294.72 --> 2298.0
way that's probably

2296.079 --> 2300.1600000000003
like a pretty unique period where yeah

2298.0 --> 2301.44
there was incredible stupidity even

2300.16 --> 2305.2799999999997
mechanical stupidity

2301.44 --> 2305.28
that doesn't happen so much anymore

2305.599 --> 2311.6800000000003
but yeah whites can still be pretty

2310.16 --> 2313.7599999999998
freaking stupid

2311.68 --> 2315.359
but when they're stupid it's almost like

2313.76 --> 2317.76
they're trying to be stupid

2315.359 --> 2319.68
on purpose to be trendy now that is

2317.76 --> 2322.0
stupid

2319.68 --> 2324.96
but that's not a constructive solution

2322.0 --> 2328.4
it's like a social

2324.96 --> 2331.599
bizarrism it's a social yeah

2328.4 --> 2333.119
issue it's not a constructive solution

2331.599 --> 2335.92
to anything

2333.119 --> 2337.2000000000003
because when i i think in general when

2335.92 --> 2340.4
whites

2337.2 --> 2342.3199999999997
nowadays try to put their mind to

2340.4 --> 2344.1600000000003
something

2342.32 --> 2345.599
yeah with everything that's available

2344.16 --> 2347.52
they can definitely

2345.599 --> 2349.76
get a lot of constructive solutions

2347.52 --> 2351.92
that's basically been grafted together

2349.76 --> 2352.8
from a lot of other whites as it were

2351.92 --> 2356.32
that are

2352.8 --> 2360.4
technically very smart so

2356.32 --> 2362.6400000000003
you know so what kind of stupidity are

2360.4 --> 2364.56
we talking about

2362.64 --> 2366.56
when it comes to constructive solutions

2364.56 --> 2368.72
i think whites are on average pretty

2366.56 --> 2372.4
damn good at it now

2368.72 --> 2372.3999999999996
compared to like yeah

2372.64 --> 2378.4
the 19th century wild west

2376.56 --> 2380.32
whites that literally didn't know what

2378.4 --> 2382.48
the [ __ ] they were doing sometimes

2380.32 --> 2385.839
it was pretty unique probably compared

2382.48 --> 2385.839
to other eras

2390.64 --> 2394.0
that's usually by the way what you get

2392.96 --> 2396.64
when yeah

2394.0 --> 2398.48
a lot of criminals are basically exiled

2396.64 --> 2400.0
to the united states

2398.48 --> 2402.16
including white criminals well guess

2400.0 --> 2403.599
what these white criminals don't have an

2402.16 --> 2405.7599999999998
education

2403.599 --> 2407.44
so yeah but they still want to get [ __ ]

2405.76 --> 2408.96
they find out there is opportunities

2407.44 --> 2411.2000000000003
they're bold

2408.96 --> 2412.2400000000002
so they'll do anything even if it makes

2411.2 --> 2415.04
no damn sense

2412.24 --> 2416.0789999999997
yeah that's what happens so it makes

2415.04 --> 2419.119
sense that that

2416.079 --> 2423.3590000000004
happened in that time period right now

2419.119 --> 2427.52
no way no way like

2423.359 --> 2430.88
what kind of criminal is is not

2427.52 --> 2434.0
educated by now like they have to

2430.88 --> 2436.839
just to survive really or

2434.0 --> 2438.319
they're just stupid thugs and then they

2436.839 --> 2442.16
yeah

2438.319 --> 2444.72
but i don't see a lot of them

2442.16 --> 2445.44
usually the ones that are real criminals

2444.72 --> 2447.9199999999996
are

2445.44 --> 2450.0
very well informed about things because

2447.92 --> 2452.4
they have to

2450.0 --> 2454.079
otherwise they yeah they they get

2452.4 --> 2457.119
crushed

2454.079 --> 2460.96
anyway not that i know that from

2457.119 --> 2464.0
personal experience but a lot recently

2460.96 --> 2465.359
uh but yeah you i think you guys know

2464.0 --> 2468.56
what i mean

2465.359 --> 2469.839
sorry i went on a roll it's just on that

2468.56 --> 2472.319
one remark

2469.839 --> 2472.319
i don't know

2475.2 --> 2481.839
i hope i didn't insult anybody just

2478.16 --> 2481.839
trying to be very honest

2485.59 --> 2491.52
[Music]

2488.16 --> 2495.839
smoking peyote thinking you're a white

2491.52 --> 2495.839
buffalo is stupid

2495.92 --> 2500.88
uh no i disagree with that though

2502.079 --> 2506.96
no i don't know attuning your frequency

2505.76 --> 2510.96
to

2506.96 --> 2513.68
the purity of certain animals

2510.96 --> 2515.599
i don't think that's stupid at all you

2513.68 --> 2516.64
can learn a lot about the spirit of

2515.599 --> 2518.8
animals

2516.64 --> 2521.2799999999997
and that's kind of the part that i do

2518.8 --> 2523.92
really appreciate about the old ways in

2521.28 --> 2527.8390000000004
native american lore

2523.92 --> 2530.0
you know what i mean so yeah

2527.839 --> 2531.68
i'm not going with that one tom parker

2530.0 --> 2535.119
now i'm not saying that you should

2531.68 --> 2538.3999999999996
worship animals and reject

2535.119 --> 2541.839
the creator that would just be

2538.4 --> 2545.599
foolish but why would you not

2541.839 --> 2550.0789999999997
observe everything and try to learn from

2545.599 --> 2553.28
it try to find the logos in things

2550.079 --> 2553.28
so what animal am i

2554.64 --> 2558.0
i am not a specific animal but i do

2556.88 --> 2561.52
resonate

2558.0 --> 2564.16
through by name even with the eagle

2561.52 --> 2564.64
literally although i yeah you don't see

2564.16 --> 2567.7599999999998
him here

2564.64 --> 2571.44
a lot because arwyn

2567.76 --> 2575.6800000000003
means friend of the eagle

2571.44 --> 2579.2000000000003
in elven so yeah there's that

2575.68 --> 2582.3999999999996
and besides that i well i was over once

2579.2 --> 2585.1189999999997
told i have a specific spirit animal

2582.4 --> 2587.119
which was actually a blue dragon so

2585.119 --> 2590.839
that's not really of course comparable

2587.119 --> 2594.4
to a living creature here in the world

2590.839 --> 2596.0789999999997
uh yeah that's just kind of as far as it

2594.4 --> 2599.44
goes really

2596.079 --> 2600.8
with serious esoteric things

2599.44 --> 2603.2000000000003
because i'm not just gonna yeah of

2600.8 --> 2604.8
course i fantasized about being a bear

2603.2 --> 2607.68
or whatever or

2604.8 --> 2609.6800000000003
or a cat you know i like cats a lot i

2607.68 --> 2614.0
understand cats a lot i even kind of

2609.68 --> 2618.0
learned certain tricks from cats

2614.0 --> 2621.04
because cats are very very skilled

2618.0 --> 2624.319
naturally and it's fascinating to me

2621.04 --> 2626.16
very fascinating so yeah cats i resonate

2624.319 --> 2628.88
with cats

2626.16 --> 2630.16
i'm a lion or a black panther or

2628.88 --> 2635.6800000000003
something

2630.16 --> 2638.24
i don't know uh

2635.68 --> 2638.24
what else

2639.68 --> 2644.16
yeah elephants i think elephants are

2642.4 --> 2648.1600000000003
pretty remarkable they have a

2644.16 --> 2651.5989999999997
very unique condensed spirit

2648.16 --> 2652.48
but yes same goes for whales but yeah

2651.599 --> 2655.2000000000003
elephants

2652.48 --> 2655.2
are closer

2657.359 --> 2664.56
so yeah i resonate with animals

2661.28 --> 2668.4
a lot and i get them i get them

2664.56 --> 2671.359
often more than i get humans because

2668.4 --> 2672.0
when animals get distracted so badly by

2671.359 --> 2675.68
their own

2672.0 --> 2678.96
inner things they're usually

2675.68 --> 2681.2799999999997
declared insane and rejected socially

2678.96 --> 2684.64
in nature well with humans it doesn't

2681.28 --> 2688.96
happen we've basically encapsulated

2684.64 --> 2692.24
well by nature considered insanity

2688.96 --> 2695.44
and managed to somehow get creative

2692.24 --> 2705.839
with it which is absolutely unique

2695.44 --> 2705.839
in that sense to humanity

2710.4 --> 2714.1600000000003
hate cats i'm deadly allergic okay yeah

2712.56 --> 2715.2
well that yeah if you're allergic that

2714.16 --> 2719.839
doesn't help

2715.2 --> 2719.839
i'm not allergic to cats thank god

2720.079 --> 2727.8390000000004
what you retract that

2724.56 --> 2732.16
how dare you just

2727.839 --> 2735.2
get over your allergy man you can

2732.16 --> 2735.2
you can do that

2735.599 --> 2747.839
it's not easy though the allergies come

2738.56 --> 2747.839
from somewhere

2752.319 --> 2756.16
right yeah i could have gotten a lot of

2754.72 --> 2760.9599999999996
allergies myself

2756.16 --> 2764.0789999999997
guess what i fought against it

2760.96 --> 2765.68
now i just have i don't know minor

2764.079 --> 2767.599
intolerances

2765.68 --> 2770.16
that's all it goes but because i listen

2767.599 --> 2773.28
very carefully to my body

2770.16 --> 2776.3999999999996
i can still take a hit of things without

2773.28 --> 2779.599
like all my body panicking and [ __ ]

2776.4 --> 2782.2400000000002
because i'm very healthy on average

2779.599 --> 2782.8
and i have a good stress management for

2782.24 --> 2785.52
yeah

2782.8 --> 2787.6800000000003
the levels of stress that yeah me and my

2785.52 --> 2790.72
physiology typically have

2787.68 --> 2795.44
so it's all

2790.72 --> 2800.0789999999997
just as management and allergies can be

2795.44 --> 2800.079
gotten rid of i think mostly

2800.72 --> 2806.0789999999997
not all of it i

2803.76 --> 2807.76
i'm not an allergy expert i just know

2806.079 --> 2811.119
that it's in my family

2807.76 --> 2813.92
or it was not so much on my dad's side

2811.119 --> 2814.6400000000003
thank god but on my mother's side a lot

2813.92 --> 2818.2400000000002
and i

2814.64 --> 2818.24
did have that sensitivity

2826.88 --> 2830.88
there's yeah there's just pretty

2829.2 --> 2835.2
interesting ways to overcome

2830.88 --> 2838.4
allergies you should look into that

2835.2 --> 2838.3999999999996
i think like even

2839.599 --> 2843.76
anyway it didn't look every allergy is

2842.4 --> 2848.0
pretty unique

2843.76 --> 2851.3590000000004
and different although yeah the typical

2848.0 --> 2854.96
setup does

2851.359 --> 2857.119
yeah it's usually the same kind of thing

2854.96 --> 2859.44
it's just pretty

2857.119 --> 2860.96
yeah a unique setting and as it were i

2859.44 --> 2863.04
don't know

2860.96 --> 2864.7200000000003
i'd have to console an allergy expert

2863.04 --> 2865.839
i'm not one of them i think my dad

2864.72 --> 2867.9199999999996
probably knows

2865.839 --> 2869.839
oh wait my stepmother knows a lot about

2867.92 --> 2872.48
that probably

2869.839 --> 2873.92
because she says skin specialist so

2872.48 --> 2876.48
she's going to deal with

2873.92 --> 2876.48
allergies

2877.52 --> 2882.64
and she has medical study

2880.96 --> 2887.839
because you have to have certain degree

2882.64 --> 2887.839
to do certain things in that profession

2888.559 --> 2893.2000000000003
yeah but anyway i don't know the fine

2890.96 --> 2897.359
details of everything sorry

2893.2 --> 2898.72
i just know that allergies are never a

2897.359 --> 2901.839
good reason

2898.72 --> 2906.3999999999996
to yeah to remove

2901.839 --> 2908.7999999999997
everything because allergies are not

2906.4 --> 2910.079
normal they they kind of arrive

2908.8 --> 2915.8390000000004
unnaturally

2910.079 --> 2915.8390000000004
has to do with epigenetics i think a lot

2920.559 --> 2923.0400000000004
anyway

2925.359 --> 2943.839
hey stallion 8012 yeah doing good doing

2928.319 --> 2943.839
very good today

2968.839 --> 2973.04
wow

2970.16 --> 2975.1189999999997
yeah yeah true wheat allergy is totally

2973.04 --> 2977.359
screwed up earth passenger it's really

2975.119 --> 2977.359
bad

2977.599 --> 2981.599
i knew somebody that had really bad

2979.839 --> 2985.92
wheat allergy

2981.599 --> 2987.52
in school it was like between 8 and 12

2985.92 --> 2989.839
or something somewhere over there i

2987.52 --> 2992.64
don't remember exactly

2989.839 --> 2994.0
but he had that really bad and it was so

2992.64 --> 2998.7999999999997
bad with him that if he

2994.0 --> 3002.0
got in contact with that it it literally

2998.8 --> 3002.7200000000003
put a halt on his growth literally like

3002.0 --> 3007.2
he was

3002.72 --> 3010.64
short even specifically because of that

3007.2 --> 3013.2
very weird and after they

3010.64 --> 3014.96
basically worked through that to

3013.2 --> 3016.48
completely prevent that from happening

3014.96 --> 3020.079
when they figured it out

3016.48 --> 3021.2
he grew further it was weird it was very

3020.079 --> 3023.92
weird to

3021.2 --> 3023.9199999999996
learn about that

3025.44 --> 3029.68
he's a french guy who lived in the

3028.96 --> 3040.8
netherlands

3029.68 --> 3043.68
like him his mother was french

3040.8 --> 3044.559
red poison sprayed on the stored wheat

3043.68 --> 3046.72
yeah yeah

3044.559 --> 3048.3190000000004
that does not surprise me at all seeking

3046.72 --> 3054.3999999999996
star water if that would turn out to be

3048.319 --> 3056.24
the case

3054.4 --> 3058.96
yeah but with the gluten george sanford

3056.24 --> 3062.9599999999996
there are other issues to it though

3058.96 --> 3067.2
and here's why gluten here's the story

3062.96 --> 3068.78
gluten has like certain things

3067.2 --> 3071.68
like on the

3068.78 --> 3074.3190000000004
[Music]

3071.68 --> 3074.319
on the grain

3074.72 --> 3078.5589999999997
there's a certain part of it that

3077.2 --> 3081.839
sometimes

3078.559 --> 3084.96
gets infected by a fungi

3081.839 --> 3087.2799999999997
fungus and that fungus is

3084.96 --> 3088.079
typically what causes that allergic

3087.28 --> 3091.76
reaction

3088.079 --> 3092.8
and it's it's even very difficult to

3091.76 --> 3096.4
spot

3092.8 --> 3097.3590000000004
it being there so it tends to kind of

3096.4 --> 3100.079
slip in

3097.359 --> 3102.64
some like particles of it slip in it

3100.079 --> 3105.3590000000004
it's not even directly related to

3102.64 --> 3108.0789999999997
pesticide although yeah it's known that

3105.359 --> 3110.48
typical pesticide

3108.079 --> 3112.8
like brings down your immune system in

3110.48 --> 3114.079
such ways that you will get allergic

3112.8 --> 3117.04
responses

3114.079 --> 3117.52
if you have tendencies to them yes so it

3117.04 --> 3120.96
it's an

3117.52 --> 3121.599
amplifier usually but the actual gluten

3120.96 --> 3126.48
allergy

3121.599 --> 3129.3590000000004
allergy comes from this weird fungus

3126.48 --> 3131.68
that's just that it's very hard to get

3129.359 --> 3134.5589999999997
rid of

3131.68 --> 3134.5589999999997
that's what i heard

3136.96 --> 3144.64
and there are other plants like spelt

3141.599 --> 3146.7200000000003
that doesn't have that

3144.64 --> 3147.92
and that's since i learned about that

3146.72 --> 3150.48
because i

3147.92 --> 3150.96
think i have slight gluten allergy like

3150.48 --> 3153.68
that

3150.96 --> 3155.119
from that specific fungus doesn't

3153.68 --> 3158.5589999999997
surprise me because

3155.119 --> 3160.96
fungus yeah i have to be careful with

3158.559 --> 3160.96
fungus

3161.28 --> 3167.52
but yeah since i then

3164.48 --> 3170.0
basically through the organic

3167.52 --> 3171.68
food scene which the there's plenty of

3170.0 --> 3173.599
options there there were like even 10

3171.68 --> 3177.5989999999997
years ago or more

3173.599 --> 3181.76
i started to eat spelt only bread

3177.599 --> 3184.1600000000003
spelt and spelt spaghetti

3181.76 --> 3185.44
everything spelt instead of wheat and

3184.16 --> 3187.68
every time looking at it

3185.44 --> 3189.52
and i like it a lot more it it was

3187.68 --> 3191.68
better it tasted nice it was a little

3189.52 --> 3194.16
bit different

3191.68 --> 3196.24
but it's better and it's like always

3194.16 --> 3197.7599999999998
thicker it's always more nutritious to

3196.24 --> 3201.1189999999997
me too

3197.76 --> 3203.2000000000003
and it doesn't bloat me because that's

3201.119 --> 3205.6800000000003
kind of what it did a little

3203.2 --> 3205.68
the wheat

3207.119 --> 3211.6800000000003
and now the yeast in typical bread also

3209.839 --> 3216.96
contributes to that

3211.68 --> 3221.04
so i went to like the sourdough type

3216.96 --> 3223.119
red spelt sourdough type great stuff

3221.04 --> 3224.96
and it's readily available here at the

3223.119 --> 3229.359
organic supermarket and yeah

3224.96 --> 3229.359
it's the best i love that [ __ ] it's

3231.9 --> 3237.839
[Music]

3234.839 --> 3237.839
great

3242.93 --> 3248.72
[Music]

3246.4 --> 3250.319
i don't know what that is george sanford

3248.72 --> 3252.5589999999997
fusarium and

3250.319 --> 3254.8
arrow get never heard of that what is

3252.559 --> 3254.8
that

3255.52 --> 3261.359
quinoa and aramaic good too yeah yeah

3259.119 --> 3263.76
that it can be good but it it's

3261.359 --> 3266.0
different though the taste is different

3263.76 --> 3268.1600000000003
i just happen to have developed a taste

3266.0 --> 3271.52
for spelt i like spelt

3268.16 --> 3274.8799999999997
it's good for me quinoa i remember

3271.52 --> 3276.839
yeah they're okay especially in certain

3274.88 --> 3279.839
type of meals you know then it

3276.839 --> 3279.839
works

3280.079 --> 3284.0
i however am much more of an

3282.16 --> 3287.04
old-fashioned

3284.0 --> 3289.28
well almost like meat and potatoes and a

3287.04 --> 3292.0
couple of veggies guys

3289.28 --> 3293.28
i'm really a basic food guy so i don't

3292.0 --> 3295.68
typically like to do

3293.28 --> 3295.6800000000003
all that

3296.4 --> 3301.52
elaborate stuff i just i've never really

3299.52 --> 3304.799
gotten the feel for that

3301.52 --> 3305.599
i make hamburgers or i make a very big

3304.799 --> 3308.559
meal

3305.599 --> 3308.559
like spaghetti

3308.799 --> 3312.64
or chili con carne but these days

3311.68 --> 3316.319
without it

3312.64 --> 3320.0789999999997
without the carne i make it vegetarian

3316.319 --> 3323.52
vegan actually and then i eat a lot

3320.079 --> 3325.3590000000004
from that so i don't typically get like

3323.52 --> 3326.0
ooh would get some of this and then and

3325.359 --> 3328.88
then have

3326.0 --> 3330.079
every day a completely different amount

3328.88 --> 3332.7200000000003
i don't know i've seen

3330.079 --> 3335.599
women do that and they're great at it i

3332.72 --> 3337.7599999999998
was always like well

3335.599 --> 3339.04
i don't mind eating that it's actually

3337.76 --> 3341.6800000000003
pretty decent

3339.04 --> 3342.24
a lot of time and you eventually find

3341.68 --> 3345.2799999999997
out which

3342.24 --> 3348.16
things you typically want to avoid but

3345.28 --> 3349.28
i'm not really good at doing that myself

3348.16 --> 3350.799
like even my

3349.28 --> 3352.6400000000003
ex-girlfriend kind of had a little bit

3350.799 --> 3356.559
of a problem with that

3352.64 --> 3358.5589999999997
because she she's wanted more variety

3356.559 --> 3361.28
because i'm very good at what i make

3358.559 --> 3363.8390000000004
it's very satisfying delicious the best

3361.28 --> 3363.8390000000004
taste the most

3364.319 --> 3370.5589999999997
love that very spicy guy

3368.4 --> 3371.52
not especially specifically hot spicy

3370.559 --> 3374.7200000000003
but just

3371.52 --> 3377.92
taste salt pepper good stuff

3374.72 --> 3378.319
i make good food but i don't know but

3377.92 --> 3380.4
that

3378.319 --> 3382.319
many different things that i make i just

3380.4 --> 3385.359
really like the same things in the

3382.319 --> 3390.5589999999997
typical cycle i guess i'm just a guy

3385.359 --> 3393.52
a typical typical guy

3390.559 --> 3395.44
and yeah eventually she started to

3393.52 --> 3397.52
complain a bit and then

3395.44 --> 3398.96
sometimes take over and have something

3397.52 --> 3401.04
completely different

3398.96 --> 3402.559
which i was which she looked up on the

3401.04 --> 3405.92
internet like who does that

3402.559 --> 3409.2000000000003
oh wait all women

3405.92 --> 3412.079
i don't though i

3409.2 --> 3412.3999999999996
asked my dad because my dad was a cook

3412.079 --> 3414.6400000000003
too

3412.4 --> 3416.1600000000003
and he really knew how to make things

3414.64 --> 3418.799
but he's also a man

3416.16 --> 3420.72
cook so had a typical cycle of meals

3418.799 --> 3423.839
which is pretty damn good by the way

3420.72 --> 3427.5989999999997
he's better at it than i am i've just

3423.839 --> 3428.16
really really refined the things that i

3427.599 --> 3431.839
like

3428.16 --> 3434.48
to perfection i'm not very

3431.839 --> 3436.319
expansionist when it comes to different

3434.48 --> 3440.799
types of dinners and all that

3436.319 --> 3440.799
though i have a little here and there

3444.16 --> 3450.96
thai food

3447.28 --> 3453.92
uh well i very rarely eat

3450.96 --> 3456.319
like oriental food let's just call it

3453.92 --> 3456.319
like that

3458.24 --> 3466.3999999999996
but there's also like organic prefab

3462.559 --> 3468.7200000000003
thai soup and all that so sometimes i do

3466.4 --> 3471.6800000000003
try something if i just really like i

3468.72 --> 3474.319
have to get something asian now

3471.68 --> 3476.319
i need freaking rice and spicy stuff and

3474.319 --> 3480.5589999999997
a couple of veggies and like

3476.319 --> 3480.96
chicken something that had those urges

3480.559 --> 3484.559
but

3480.96 --> 3486.839
that's not in my common food staple

3484.559 --> 3489.8390000000004
