41.97 --> 44.03
you

48.489 --> 55.879
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

52.55 --> 57.89
early-bird number 579 I'm your host

55.879 --> 59.69
Arwen and before we start to show please

57.89 --> 61.61

do support me through the paypal patreon

74.149 --> 78.11
super chat and the membership system

76.25 --> 81.53
joined button that would be much

78.11 --> 85.58
appreciated so yeah I was a little out

81.53 --> 89.0
of breath Dericks I've got a drink from

85.58 --> 91.19
the freezer in between the intro this is

89.0 --> 93.909
and it's still freaking warm it is so

91.19 --> 97.49
warm look at that

93.909 --> 99.56
it's it's very similar to yesterday

97.49 --> 101.8
except there's no haze up there this

99.56 --> 107.659
time look it's just

101.8 --> 110.36
yeah this very light more situation so

107.659 --> 116.5
it's more like two days ago I guess but

110.36 --> 125.90899999999999
the couple of clouds with very small see

116.5 --> 129.539
it's just constant Sun heavy warm

125.909 --> 134.04000000000002
and yeah the wind is still kind of nice

129.539 --> 136.44
nice and fresh when yeah it yeah it does

134.04 --> 138.35999999999999
blow every now and then and then stops

136.44 --> 143.37
again anyway I got a lot of drinks with

138.36 --> 145.92000000000002
me today I got the other half of the

143.37 --> 157.019
grapefruit juice which was a great idea

145.92 --> 163.61999999999998
I thought nice green tea warm slightly

157.019 --> 168.299
less nice and special treat and gusto

163.62 --> 174.36
energy drink air and this is yeah I

168.299 --> 176.489
don't know is this it's like not an not

174.36 --> 178.11
an energy drink in the standard style

176.489 --> 181.29
it's not really like Cola

178.11 --> 184.89000000000001
it's like herb mix thingy organic and

181.29 --> 186.9
it's it's not super cheap but it's nice

184.89 --> 191.069
and I have to say that I drank one

186.9 --> 193.92000000000002
yesterday too and whatever is in there

191.069 --> 196.5
but it really kind of helps you get

193.92 --> 197.67
through heat a little so I thought why

196.5 --> 200.66
not do that again

197.67 --> 200.66
mm-hmm

205.97 --> 214.8
it's kind of almost Cola but not really

209.22 --> 218.57
almost tea not really it's not cocaine

214.8 --> 221.68
and that's not even funny good servants

218.57 --> 221.68
[Music]

223.79 --> 227.63
let's see what's in there

229.83 --> 235.4
yeah goroh karana colum not oh there's

233.07 --> 240.62
some : I did it

235.4 --> 246.5
panax ginseng crystal anthem flower

240.62 --> 252.8
Chinese Angelica spine date seed

246.5 --> 253.98
Siberian ginseng panax so pseudo ginseng

252.8 --> 256.95
okay

253.98 --> 262.43
pseudo ginseng mm-hmm so it's not really

256.95 --> 268.97999999999996
ginseng I don't know red sage root red

262.43 --> 273.95
peony root fake worth root Szechuan

268.98 --> 277.53000000000003
lovage root for leaf lady Belle root

273.95 --> 278.09999999999997
American ginseng so is that enough herps

277.53 --> 285.78
for you

278.1 --> 294.38
this herbs lots of ginseng including

285.78 --> 294.38
pseudo ginseng good serpent

294.53 --> 304.88
what why are you bringing up [ __ ] up

299.04 --> 304.88
drugs whoa what

309.5 --> 323.38
my jet just crashed that was weird

312.25 --> 326.21
didn't crash you know yes though yeah

323.38 --> 328.15
well good servant I don't have a cold so

326.21 --> 342.66999999999996
I don't know why I wouldn't eat that

328.15 --> 342.66999999999996
yeah sorry let's see who is in chat

342.97 --> 350.03000000000003
whoa yeah

347.03 --> 355.15999999999997
Firefox just entirely crashed for some

350.03 --> 357.89
reason don't know why anyway yeah last

355.16 --> 362.39000000000004

362.39 --> 376.03
Stanley Missouri bear Obama cool good

369.919 --> 376.03
servant Steve

376.69 --> 381.9
Oh a tank

383.19 --> 386.51
I read Priestley

393.16 --> 403.12
yeah I think I got you all so it's still

398.68 --> 405.73
hot I survived my my paper runs

403.12 --> 409.03000000000003
yesterday but only barely and I mean it

405.73 --> 411.76
I went in like right Wendy after-show at

409.03 --> 414.4
the Flat Earth debate started I I

411.76 --> 416.08
quickly went to just did it just as

414.4 --> 421.87
quick as possible hoping to be back

416.08 --> 425.32
before the end and I was but man like in

421.87 --> 427.57
that Sun that was just not funny I was

425.32 --> 431.05
like constantly dripping with sweat like

427.57 --> 435.21999999999997
constantly I had to like wipe off my

431.05 --> 438.61
forehead every every five minutes or it

435.22 --> 440.44000000000005
would get in my eyes this is that type

438.61 --> 448.29
of heat and there was not a lot of

440.44 --> 448.29
places of shadow but I just did it

450.74 --> 460.22
and then just chilled out back here with

456.71 --> 463.60999999999996
a cold beer and the Sun was already kind

460.22 --> 467.57000000000005
of going down or letting isn't going

463.61 --> 470.81
down it it's like at the horizon enough

467.57 --> 474.29
and it was just I know it was a very

470.81 --> 480.29
nice summer afternoon yesterday very

474.29 --> 486.73
nice and I saw the moon in a very

480.29 --> 494.3
peculiar way very late and was

486.73 --> 497.09000000000003
technically over there by the horizon

494.3 --> 502.12
and it was like a moon sickle a very

497.09 --> 505.19
bright moon cycle with the darker side

502.12 --> 508.43
was I don't know I saw it it again

505.19 --> 511.76
it was contrasting with the rest of the

508.43 --> 515.9300000000001
sky so it was almost like the moon dark

511.76 --> 520.13
side was darker then everything around

515.93 --> 522.8599999999999
the moon was weird I wish I could have I

520.13 --> 525.77
wish I would have filmed it it was

522.86 --> 528.97
pretty awesome see but it's just too

525.77 --> 528.97
flustered and everything

535.68 --> 539.18
[Music]

554.92 --> 560.25
what are you talking about Missouri

557.079 --> 560.25
where chinchillas

567.57 --> 575.9300000000001
all right you bought a chinchilla what

573.3 --> 575.93
is that again

597.25 --> 602.34
you used to breed them oh really okay

604.47 --> 607.619
[Music]

608.97 --> 621.6700000000001
remember what they are

612.42 --> 624.16
oh right it's sort of a rat I thought it

621.67 --> 627.03
was more like a ferret answer but no

624.16 --> 631.29
pendants I remember and wrong

627.03 --> 631.29
right yeah those reaches they're funny

634.65 --> 641.16
or they're like giant gerbils basically

638.89 --> 641.16
right

657.55 --> 661.1099999999999
yeah thanks

669.87 --> 677.18
now you just need to give the male

672.36 --> 677.1800000000001
ferret a lot of money

678.05 --> 685.17
remember in South Park they figured that

682.29 --> 686.5799999999999
out that for some weird reason people

685.17 --> 688.89
with a lot of money just want to have

686.58 --> 691.7700000000001
sex with a lot of women and all that and

688.89 --> 693.54
they tested it on a monkey gave it a lot

691.77 --> 699.8
of money and then started going wild and

693.54 --> 699.8
having sex with everyone and this sorry

723.3 --> 727.459
a paste off a flat Earth Map oh here we

726.6 --> 729.929
go

727.459 --> 733.41
no that's good you know good to have

729.929 --> 739.259
some ballers otherwise we just be

733.41 --> 742.41
talking about no animals and drinks and

739.259 --> 745.11
food and all right so on a flat earth

742.41 --> 750.029
map I don't know man how long does it

745.11 --> 754.23
take how long does it take such a flight

750.029 --> 758.49
if there is such a thing what half would

754.23 --> 760.889
they be saying they would be taking like

758.49 --> 766.86
what would GPS be saying and then let's

760.889 --> 771.48
put it all together you know I don't

766.86 --> 773.91
think the earth is a disk so every time

771.48 --> 776.36
it's flight times this flight times that

773.91 --> 783.86
oh how does it work on a flat earth map

776.36 --> 783.86
yeah well I don't know

786.66 --> 798.209
every map is flat yeah yeah yeah yeah

789.24 --> 800.97
everybody is flat of course but yeah

798.209 --> 805.56
whenever map you're gonna take to

800.97 --> 807.6600000000001
coordinate a flight yeah that's called

805.56 --> 811.529
coordinating a flight so you take a map

807.66 --> 813.899
whether it be a rectangular looping

811.529 --> 816.24
based projection or a disk based

813.899 --> 818.19
projection and then you put lines as to

816.24 --> 820.889
the rough trajectory you want to take

818.19 --> 823.5290000000001
now if that's actually gonna literally

820.889 --> 830.49
work out with the path you're gonna fly

823.529 --> 834.12
over that's something else you know

830.49 --> 839.699
coordinating on a map isn't the same as

834.12 --> 844.19
actually flying the presupposed

839.699 --> 844.1899999999999
trajectory among that on that map

848.84 --> 855.59
hey Bo

851.24 --> 855.59
hashtag Moreland sure why not

860.92 --> 873.9499999999999
okay 14 hours well that doesn't mean

865.16 --> 876.56
anything to me really okay look I'm not

873.95 --> 878.3900000000001
studied up on the suppose that flight

876.56 --> 882.67
time issue you know there's some other

878.39 --> 887.84
flat earthers that have early on from a

882.67 --> 890.4799999999999
angle of disc versus globe took that on

887.84 --> 892.58
and went all into the details and I will

890.48 --> 894.38
know all the flight times roughly

892.58 --> 897.11
because of confrontation and all that

894.38 --> 898.01
and discussion with glowers I'm not one

897.11 --> 902.03
of those guys

898.01 --> 904.34
I was always yeah but it doesn't have to

902.03 --> 906.23
be that way it doesn't I was I was the

904.34 --> 908.84
one getting in the way getting people

906.23 --> 912.02
confused on the flatter side like why is

908.84 --> 914.33
he doctor are viewing us there are we

912.02 --> 919.6999999999999
trying to win off the ball I'm like yeah

914.33 --> 924.94
but it's you don't know what the

919.7 --> 928.13
orientation of the of the landmasses are

924.94 --> 936.1300000000001
it's not that disk it's not literally

928.13 --> 936.13
that is so I don't think so at least

956.12 --> 962.499
right all I know is that the arguments

959.3 --> 966.8
relating to flight times when concerns

962.499 --> 970.85
the presupposed Coriolis effect and that

966.8 --> 973.939
is how I know where it gets silly when

970.85 --> 976.0690000000001
it's about the spin of the earth I know

973.939 --> 979.0999999999999
more about that argument a lot more by

976.069 --> 983.6289999999999
now then this the flight times issue

979.1 --> 986.86
that just always gave me a headache do I

983.629 --> 986.86
have more Fork stories

993.07 --> 997.2600000000001
what are you talking what

1002.44 --> 1010.1800000000001
that's ridiculous it was just a stupid

1005.17 --> 1012.639
story dude come on I've described before

1010.18 --> 1015.2199999999999
how I can get really pissed off out of

1012.639 --> 1021.699
nowhere and this was just a I don't know

1015.22 --> 1026.98
a silly funny example is that instead

1021.699 --> 1030.61
like all you care about that's so

1026.98 --> 1033.339
important you want to see more Arwen

1030.61 --> 1037.7199999999998
getting crazy you want to refine more in

1033.339 --> 1041.4389999999999
this unique craziness how does it

1037.72 --> 1044.579
express itself what is that is that so

1041.439 --> 1044.5790000000002
important to you

1044.73 --> 1057.179
yes I showed you a fork that's right it

1051.73 --> 1057.179
let us know you more what by the fork

1058.11 --> 1066.9399999999998
well maybe those like personal habits

1062.11 --> 1069.01
are I don't know not really anybody's

1066.94 --> 1074.1100000000001
business but people that actually deal

1069.01 --> 1077.14
with me face-to-face you know so I know

1074.11 --> 1080.4699999999998
you love to know every freaking detail

1077.14 --> 1083.95
so you can I don't know reverse engineer

1080.47 --> 1085.8700000000001
and Arwen emulator or something the

1083.95 --> 1088.63
figure dude like cross-reference it with

1085.87 --> 1090.58
the predicted Antichrist or something

1088.63 --> 1096.8500000000001
whatever the [ __ ] you weirdos do out

1090.58 --> 1099.1299999999999
there but yeah that's not my problem it

1096.85 --> 1100.84
was just a fork it was a silly

1099.13 --> 1102.6100000000001
conversation it didn't even have

1100.84 --> 1106.24
anything to do with the fork I kind of

1102.61 --> 1109.4189999999999
brought the fork forth the kind of move

1106.24 --> 1111.64
away from just the exposure of me doing

1109.419 --> 1114.22
some yeah having a stupid impulse that I

1111.64 --> 1118.419
don't like because I find that part more

1114.22 --> 1122.32
embarrassing not the freaking fork but a

1118.419 --> 1124.659
fork was a funny distraction first an

1122.32 --> 1128.22
example and then it became a distraction

1124.659 --> 1128.22
and you bought it Flat Earth data

1138.07 --> 1150.1499999999999
I dunno dank I don't think flatter data

1140.86 --> 1153.51
is fake he's just a troll at times what

1150.15 --> 1153.51
what are you doing

1159.36 --> 1165.3
oh really now you didn't have to ban him

1163.05 --> 1168.33
for that he was just really triggered I

1165.3 --> 1171.09
think but I understand you're banning

1168.33 --> 1178.05
him so I'm not giving you any penalty

1171.09 --> 1180.1499999999999
for that but yeah me calling other

1178.05 --> 1182.85
people weirdo do you remember like what

1180.15 --> 1186.42
became came before that to

1182.85 --> 1189.3899999999999
cross-reference character traits with

1186.42 --> 1191.76
some prediction model for figuring out

1189.39 --> 1194.46
who the anti-crisis or so yeah that if

1191.76 --> 1200.94
you're into that [ __ ] you're pretty damn

1194.46 --> 1205.1100000000001
weird okay yeah you are if you're into

1200.94 --> 1213.39
that so me calling people that like that

1205.11 --> 1216.7199999999998
a weirdo that's it's nothing because I

1213.39 --> 1222.8100000000002
am definitely not weirder than people

1216.72 --> 1224.28
that do that [ __ ] and I think there's

1222.81 --> 1229.02
probably more of them out there than you

1224.28 --> 1231.81
realize just all waiting for the final

1229.02 --> 1234.45
squirt can't handle the world anymore so

1231.81 --> 1236.8799999999999
they're just just predicting and

1234.45 --> 1239.21
puzzling waiting for the final squirt to

1236.88 --> 1239.21
happen

1245.529 --> 1249.669
and the Bears know what I mean

1255.67 --> 1274.42
ah ah so much better when there's no Sun

1265.48 --> 1279.0
on hearing mossy you can see the Sun

1274.42 --> 1284.8500000000001
line right right so now it's G just

1279.0 --> 1293.38
outside of the door

1284.85 --> 1296.86
such a big difference then it does shift

1293.38 --> 1299.5800000000002
pretty quickly just a matter of 50 50

1296.86 --> 1299.58
minutes or so

1302.13 --> 1311.38
now now you do it know if you're gonna

1309.1 --> 1314.4299999999998
if you're gonna or whenif I something

1311.38 --> 1314.43
and then you got to do it right

1316.32 --> 1322.039
[Music]

1318.57 --> 1326.37
you can just put it I J and everything

1322.039 --> 1329.49
if you'd say squirt win okay that would

1326.37 --> 1331.789
be a technically correct adaptation of

1329.49 --> 1331.789
the word

1342.15 --> 1347.8000000000002
yes quark when is the de freaky

1345.13 --> 1352.9
alter-ego of myself on the other side in

1347.8 --> 1357.07
the dark world based on myself 20 years

1352.9 --> 1369.3700000000001
ago in my most hopeless mindset that's

1357.07 --> 1375.52
squirt winner I hate him I have I say it

1369.37 --> 1377.59
constantly but yeah I move a little bit

1375.52 --> 1380.95
beyond the word machinations because I'm

1377.59 --> 1383.35
now trying to refine it further as to

1380.95 --> 1386.4
what type of machinations so I'm

1383.35 --> 1396.1899999999998
basically continuing building the

1386.4 --> 1399.8700000000001
structure you know I I develop I develop

1396.19 --> 1399.8700000000001
the structuring

1403.7 --> 1411.41
am i like Arwen hood yeah I have shot a

1407.88 --> 1411.41
bow I have shot this bow

1418.45 --> 1427.45
yeah if you want to call me our twin

1420.519 --> 1429.779
hoods that's fine although I'm not from

1427.45 --> 1429.779
the hood

1453.08 --> 1456.82
I thank God he's afk

1480.92 --> 1491.1200000000001
horizon rises to eye level yes

1485.8 --> 1493.6699999999998
roughly well technically yes the exact

1491.12 --> 1495.8
angle might be slightly off but it's

1493.67 --> 1504.46
always going to be off in the same

1495.8 --> 1504.46
amount so it's almost exactly eye level

1523.15 --> 1530.5500000000002
think things go down when they reach the

1526.39 --> 1530.5500000000002
horizon what you can't reach the horizon

1531.45 --> 1538.72
the horizon the horizon is a virtual

1534.43 --> 1541.3300000000002
place if you go to where you saw the

1538.72 --> 1544.42
horizon then it will not look the same

1541.33 --> 1553.57
to you and be an effective horizon at

1544.42 --> 1556.51
that point what does happen however is

1553.57 --> 1560.23
that if you lower your observation point

1556.51 --> 1564.1299999999999
over the plane you are looking over then

1560.23 --> 1567.01
the optical slant which is a

1564.13 --> 1570.5500000000002
manifestation of the horizon like the

1567.01 --> 1573.97
first the apparent edge let's get all

1570.55 --> 1578.32
Retro the apparent edge formerly thought

1573.97 --> 1581.77
of as an edge will migrate closer to you

1578.32 --> 1584.83
as the observer height lowers it will

1581.77 --> 1589.03
get closer you go higher up then that

1584.83 --> 1592.3899999999999
the optical slant point will move

1589.03 --> 1595.75
farther away and beyond that point

1592.39 --> 1598.8700000000001
things will always start to conceal from

1595.75 --> 1600.61
bottom up at a linear rate from that

1598.87 --> 1605.559
point on from the upper Coast land point

1600.61 --> 1609.309
on and clover's like to think that that

1605.559 --> 1611.94
is obstruction due to blocking by earth

1609.309 --> 1616.32
curvature but that's not the case

1611.94 --> 1620.74
because the horizon is an optical effect

1616.32 --> 1623.309
and not a physical obstruction based

1620.74 --> 1623.309
effect

1625.75 --> 1631.6
that's very hard to understand if you

1628.45 --> 1637.48
deal a lot with autographic fuel based

1631.6 --> 1640.81
models because they don't reveal this

1637.48 --> 1643.6
standard visual effect of things

1640.81 --> 1646.8899999999999
concealing themselves from the observer

1643.6 --> 1651.28
bottom up after an optical slant points

1646.89 --> 1654.9
optical slants cannot be shown in an

1651.28 --> 1658.78
outer graphic view because it completely

1654.9 --> 1661.3300000000002
disconcerted perspective there is no

1658.78 --> 1663.52
proper perspective possible in an

1661.33 --> 1666.6899999999998
orthographic view so all the effects

1663.52 --> 1669.16
that spring forth from perspective

1666.69 --> 1673.5700000000002
including the optical slant

1669.16 --> 1677.8200000000002
The Horizon effect itself concealment

1673.57 --> 1681.9099999999999
from the bottom up all that cannot be

1677.82 --> 1684.9399999999998
represented visually in an orthographic

1681.91 --> 1688.5900000000001
view because it misses the proper

1684.94 --> 1691.5900000000001
functions for that it doesn't apply

1688.59 --> 1691.59
perspectives

1698.48 --> 1706.3700000000001
the effective horizon is the horizon but

1703.01 --> 1711.35
it is a horizon based on that you're

1706.37 --> 1713.3899999999999
presupposing there is another horizon to

1711.35 --> 1716.75
which the effective horizon is the

1713.39 --> 1719.39
outcome that's when you get this

1716.75 --> 1721.25
branching in horizons is when you are

1719.39 --> 1723.68
forcing yourself and others to

1721.25 --> 1727.01
presuppose that there is an actual other

1723.68 --> 1730.45
horizon and that the effective horizon

1727.01 --> 1734.21
or the apparent horizon is the end

1730.45 --> 1737.03
result of being influenced by

1734.21 --> 1742.9
terrestrial fractional that fictitious

1737.03 --> 1746.98
nonsense on to the geometrical sphere

1742.9 --> 1752.8100000000002
curved horizon the geometrical horizon

1746.98 --> 1756.79
but yeah the disk on torsion between the

1752.81 --> 1763.1
actual visual reality and the model is

1756.79 --> 1766.21
is outrageous and is due to the complete

1763.1 --> 1768.77
ignoring of perspective it's taken out

1766.21 --> 1773.06
it's basically resting upon the

1768.77 --> 1775.67
autographic view mistake people to look

1773.06 --> 1781.28
at it like that through that model and

1775.67 --> 1783.92
then not realize that it's missing

1781.28 --> 1786.11
perspective and then think that those

1783.92 --> 1790.3700000000001
effects can be earth curved when they

1786.11 --> 1793.82
obviously cannot because that's just a

1790.37 --> 1796.4599999999998
side effect naturally of viewing things

1793.82 --> 1800.12
you can demonstrate this by looking over

1796.46 --> 1804.32
a flat measured flat surface long

1800.12 --> 1806.1799999999998
surface going very clear yes near it

1804.32 --> 1808.6599999999999
with your eyes or with the camera and

1806.18 --> 1813.02
then you'll see the optical slant effect

1808.66 --> 1816.02
manifesting right there on camera there

1813.02 --> 1818.36
will be a cutoff point from the surface

1816.02 --> 1820.6299999999999
you're looking over after after a point

1818.36 --> 1824.06
which is not the end

1820.63 --> 1827.0900000000001
despite the object you are looking over

1824.06 --> 1830.54
at that point being measurably confirmed

1827.09 --> 1832.1899999999998
perfectly straight and flat and still

1830.54 --> 1833.81
concealment will happen well

1832.19 --> 1836.5700000000002
an orthographic view does not have an

1833.81 --> 1840.59
explanation for this it's gonna try to

1836.57 --> 1842.4099999999999
make you force yourself to just assume

1840.59 --> 1845.12
that everything must be curved

1842.41 --> 1847.0700000000002
everything including that shoe that

1845.12 --> 1849.83
which is presumed to be flat everything

1847.07 --> 1852.77
must be our base because this effect is

1849.83 --> 1856.49
happening and that can only happen on a

1852.77 --> 1858.77
curved thing according to ballers that

1856.49 --> 1862.15
base their world view on the autographic

1858.77 --> 1862.15
view see how that works

1887.1 --> 1892.83
well Green Piper of course you can trust

1890.429 --> 1895.71
your eyes but the most important thing

1892.83 --> 1898.47
is you have to understand your eyes you

1895.71 --> 1902.8700000000001
have to understand and figure out how

1898.47 --> 1905.279
side works what are the natural effects

1902.87 --> 1907.649
concerning optics and sight

1905.279 --> 1909.899
how does it work mechanically these

1907.649 --> 1914.1299999999999
things can be figured out I have figured

1909.899 --> 1918.6
it out from grassroots up completely

1914.13 --> 1921.1200000000001
based on my own observations not even

1918.6 --> 1923.309
really reading into anything written

1921.12 --> 1926.4289999999999
down even though some of that has been

1923.309 --> 1928.58
kind of presented it never really caught

1926.429 --> 1933.44
on with me too well

1928.58 --> 1933.4399999999998
it's just too many directions taken

1944.73 --> 1948.89
ah you know I'll just

1949.149 --> 1959.039
show my optical slant model for good

1956.769 --> 1959.039
measure

1966.98 --> 1970.97
no that's not one

1975.95 --> 1978.7
argh

1984.41 --> 1992.5400000000002
hmm yeah I know I'm gonna do this

2003.44 --> 2006.19
right

2010.83 --> 2014.07
[Music]

2030.18 --> 2040.01
it's getting hot in it like Italy if it

2034.8 --> 2045.6499999999999
it in hot so there you go I on a stick

2040.01 --> 2047.94
feel a few and the optical slant

2045.65 --> 2050.19
initiated by their fraction then the

2047.94 --> 2052.38
Mirage in zone where yeah

2050.19 --> 2054.149
things can be been displaced in relation

2052.38 --> 2059.13
to the horizon the optical slag point

2054.149 --> 2063.5
and then at the end always end of sight

2059.13 --> 2068.78
caused by refraction blurring of things

2063.5 --> 2074.96
so yeah that is my model to describe

2068.78 --> 2074.96
what happens within sight itself

2096.12 --> 2105.6
a parent means visually registered it a

2102.33 --> 2108.89
parent basically means it it is being

2105.6 --> 2113.63
picked up through wages to visual

2108.89 --> 2117.35
registration that is what that is that

2113.63 --> 2120.54
is what it's pointing at it's not pseudo

2117.35 --> 2130.77
which means it's not real no it's a

2120.54 --> 2133.62
parent a peer visual aha guys I need to

2130.77 --> 2136.14
stand outside and take up some of this

2133.62 --> 2138.65
win because of just cooking here it's

2136.14 --> 2138.65
terrible

2160.28 --> 2164.0
all right yeah

2164.39 --> 2170.299
it's just it's kind of nice but

2170.93 --> 2176.0389999999998
technically in here it's kind of wind

2173.19 --> 2179.009
still so that still makes things collect

2176.039 --> 2181.38
heat and me as a person I am still

2179.009 --> 2183.93
creating heat if there's not enough

2181.38 --> 2191.1600000000003
airflow that heat starts to pile up in

2183.93 --> 2193.589
my body this is I'll be alright it's

2191.16 --> 2197.3689999999997
just the time of today this is just like

2193.589 --> 2199.95
yesterday and at least today I don't

2197.369 --> 2202.8900000000003
have to go out in the freakin heat to

2199.95 --> 2205.46
spread newspaper so I'll be fine don't

2202.89 --> 2205.46
worry about it

2213.05 --> 2218.23
that's a hot day in Ireland as well

2214.82 --> 2218.23
Jhansi oddity

2249.53 --> 2255.03
yeah one thing I've also noticed is that

2251.91 --> 2257.1299999999997
with this hot weather there's just a a

2255.03 --> 2261.15
whole ton of different types of bugs

2257.13 --> 2264.57
that are that are also just going around

2261.15 --> 2266.28
like pretty big beetles and stuff and

2264.57 --> 2267.84
it's always good to know like yes

2266.28 --> 2270.3900000000003
they're still around

2267.84 --> 2272.7200000000003
haven't been exterminated by poison and

2270.39 --> 2276.0899999999997
[ __ ] good

2272.72 --> 2281.37
it's like days they help the plants and

2276.09 --> 2291.06
then the birds eat them yeah it's great

2281.37 --> 2297.5
bugs are awesome except for wasps and

2291.06 --> 2297.5
mosquitoes and the likes of those

2308.52 --> 2313.14
perspective is kind of illusion

2313.98 --> 2323.589
well it's inherent to sight illusion is

2320.38 --> 2331.569
also inherent to sight you can't have an

2323.589 --> 2335.319
illusion there's no sight unless it's

2331.569 --> 2336.88
like verbally making you create that

2335.319 --> 2341.16
illusion in your mind that's something

2336.88 --> 2341.1600000000003
else is like wordplay and all that but I

2343.079 --> 2351.9
don't know illusion is when it's not as

2347.23 --> 2355.45
it seems perspective is as it seems

2351.9 --> 2360.19
it does make things look far away and

2355.45 --> 2362.89
close by so I don't see why you're

2360.19 --> 2367.15
calling it illusion that doesn't make

2362.89 --> 2375.609
any sense to me so how do we know what's

2367.15 --> 2378.1800000000003
real well by figuring it out you gotta

2375.609 --> 2378.18
test it

2386.82 --> 2393.42
you gotta realize also that if you take

2390.06 --> 2394.95
science in the correct fashion if you

2393.42 --> 2397.41
understand how it really works the

2394.95 --> 2400.56
method and all that then you yeah you

2397.41 --> 2403.77
will also recognize that there will

2400.56 --> 2406.44
probably always be more things than you

2403.77 --> 2409.2
know and like really know and know how

2406.44 --> 2413.36
to figure out the details and can

2409.2 --> 2416.1
predict things without it being science

2413.36 --> 2420.4500000000003
there will be always more things that

2416.1 --> 2423.81
you can actually figure out and know and

2420.45 --> 2428.2799999999997
predict without it being science you

2423.81 --> 2431.2799999999997
know science is not the ultimate only

2428.28 --> 2433.44
thing that you can use to figure out

2431.28 --> 2435.5400000000004
what is real and what isn't it's just

2433.44 --> 2439.53
like the bottom line it's like the

2435.54 --> 2442.8
ultimate bottom line that oh you could

2439.53 --> 2445.98
consider is preventing the whole body of

2442.8 --> 2452.4
knowledge just from venting off into the

2445.98 --> 2454.98
abyss it's the plug within the hourglass

2452.4 --> 2459.39
that prevents the whole knowledge just

2454.98 --> 2464.52
from going into the [ __ ] that's kind

2459.39 --> 2468.8599999999997
of how I see it but that doesn't mean

2464.52 --> 2468.86
that you can't just figure things out

2473.829 --> 2480.619
you know I even freaking figure things

2477.289 --> 2484.369
out through through conceptualization

2480.619 --> 2486.71
about speciality and conceptual mediums

2484.369 --> 2488.78
and even presupposing those conceptual

2486.71 --> 2491.26
mediums how they work and yeah I got I'm

2488.78 --> 2495.829
getting it right from that

2491.26 --> 2497.0
presuppositional position because I

2495.829 --> 2499.28
can't figure it out you don't

2497.0 --> 2503.0
necessarily need science to do that you

2499.28 --> 2518.059
just need to figure it all out

2503.0 --> 2523.869
compare it all for something just hiding

2518.059 --> 2523.869
from the heat it seems nice just

2529.869 --> 2536.71
mmhmm yeah nice and shadowy over here

2549.74 --> 2556.14
he just came walking in from outside as

2552.869 --> 2558.4100000000003
usual he does that a lot during this

2556.14 --> 2558.41
time

2569.78 --> 2577.7900000000004
right yeah guns have never on our MP is

2574.46 --> 2582.29
right there's no physical observable

2577.79 --> 2587.06
curvature and give him a drink no it's a

2582.29 --> 2589.79
freaking cat it's not a dog yeah dogs

2587.06 --> 2596.59
you give them a big bowl of water you

2589.79 --> 2596.59
they love that [ __ ] this is a cat I know

2596.71 --> 2602.3
maybe if there was some tasty juicy

2601.07 --> 2614.21
stuff in it

2602.3 --> 2616.4300000000003
then they might take a lick but yeah no

2614.21 --> 2620.36
physical observable curvature and the

2616.43 --> 2623.24
funny thing is it's not just about yeah

2620.36 --> 2624.77
is there any obstruction is it go over

2623.24 --> 2627.95
the curve that idea you know what we've

2624.77 --> 2631.34
been busy with and up until a year ago

2627.95 --> 2635.4199999999996
pretty much for four years five years

2631.34 --> 2639.4700000000003
maybe well there's all these all their

2635.42 --> 2642.62
types of lures that you can also use to

2639.47 --> 2646.04
figure things out like natural geometry

2642.62 --> 2648.02
and logic and even math but so is

2646.04 --> 2655.7799999999997
secondary you got to keep that in mind

2648.02 --> 2659.5099999999998
so geometry is like a very well

2655.78 --> 2662.21
trainable and established type of

2659.51 --> 2664.4
knowledge that you can train and test

2662.21 --> 2670.2200000000003
and measure and do all kinds of things

2664.4 --> 2671.9300000000003
with and yeah spiracle this sphere it's

2670.22 --> 2675.14
very distinct and has all these

2671.93 --> 2679.58
geometrical consequences and you can

2675.14 --> 2681.5299999999997
test it you can test it every time in

2679.58 --> 2685.67
many ways and with light play and all

2681.53 --> 2689.53
that in yeah Earth is just not that

2685.67 --> 2694.4300000000003
sphere and technically you can even

2689.53 --> 2696.6800000000003
build a simulation these days it's more

2694.43 --> 2698.75
doable because there's more computer

2696.68 --> 2701.2999999999997
capacity in memory you could actually

2698.75 --> 2702.52
simulate an actual sphere off the

2701.3 --> 2708.4900000000002
presuppose Earth

2702.52 --> 2712.87
sighs and then have a viewer and it's

2708.49 --> 2714.97
not really going to look like reality

2712.87 --> 2718.21
because there is going to be a

2714.97 --> 2720.52
cumulative drop into the distance at the

2718.21 --> 2722.86
horizon of course it will still show

2720.52 --> 2725.41
perspective you know it's not gonna show

2722.86 --> 2728.38
it in the in the curvature calculator

2725.41 --> 2730.42
but in an actual 3d simulator yeah you

2728.38 --> 2732.25
have to it doesn't make you can't make

2730.42 --> 2735.1
it will soon look completely

2732.25 --> 2737.4
hallucinatory if you don't if you make

2735.1 --> 2741.91
it all too graphic that will be freaky

2737.4 --> 2746.71
that will be really freaky but yeah you

2741.91 --> 2750.2799999999997
can simulate it and things would just mm

2746.71 --> 2755.53
drop off suddenly at a increased pace

2750.28 --> 2757.3900000000003
like going off a rollercoaster is just

2755.53 --> 2759.9700000000003
certainly gonna drop really fast and

2757.39 --> 2764.5899999999997
it's always going to do always always

2759.97 --> 2768.8799999999997
always always without a single exception

2764.59 --> 2770.9500000000003
ever in a simulation in a real

2768.88 --> 2774.07
simulation where you can alter the

2770.95 --> 2777.12
actual real refraction the thickness of

2774.07 --> 2781.54
the air which will cause the blurring up

2777.12 --> 2785.14
effect at the end of sight and me

2781.54 --> 2788.2599999999998
rushing displacement beyond the horizon

2785.14 --> 2790.81
yeah that that would all be included but

2788.26 --> 2793.3300000000004
with all of that it would still drop

2790.81 --> 2795.91
cognitively every single freaking time

2793.33 --> 2796.96
without exception the reality doesn't

2795.91 --> 2800.77
happen like that

2796.96 --> 2803.56
I always keep keep on saying the first

2800.77 --> 2806.17
moment that the moment I developed their

2803.56 --> 2809.92
optical slant concept with the drawing

2806.17 --> 2812.35
the eye on a stick as I showed before it

2809.92 --> 2815.32
always accompanies it's very specific

2812.35 --> 2817.48
the optical slant point there is

2815.32 --> 2821.65
concealment beyond the optical slant

2817.48 --> 2824.26
point and the consuming amount increases

2821.65 --> 2825.67
over distance in relation to the

2824.26 --> 2829.2400000000002
observer if they don't change their

2825.67 --> 2833.5
height and the amount it will be

2829.24 --> 2834.6099999999997
concealed will be linear versus that

2833.5 --> 2838.46
distance

2834.61 --> 2841.55
so say just purely theoretical just for

2838.46 --> 2843.53
an arbitrary number say that you're

2841.55 --> 2847.46
looking at something behind an optical

2843.53 --> 2854.57
slant point and it's an object say 10

2847.46 --> 2856.43
feet high wall and then point 1 it's 2

2854.57 --> 2858.6800000000003
feet of it is obstructed or it's

2856.43 --> 2861.47
concealed for from the apparently

2858.68 --> 2866.12
concealed you can't see that part right

2861.47 --> 2868.31
Riley's criteria diffraction oh yeah all

2866.12 --> 2870.35
of it the the preponderance of it the

2868.31 --> 2872.69
effect the optical slant the consuming

2870.35 --> 2875.0
it's there two feeders is obstructed so

2872.69 --> 2878.51
now you're gonna take the double

2875.0 --> 2880.52
distance from the optic apparent optical

2878.51 --> 2883.3
slant beginning point to that that the

2880.52 --> 2887.42
10 feet wall double the distance away

2883.3 --> 2890.75
well guarantee you the amount of

2887.42 --> 2897.02
consuming at that point is going to be 4

2890.75 --> 2899.66
feet it's going to be 4 feet you know in

2897.02 --> 2903.77
my perspective it might be twice as

2899.66 --> 2905.2999999999997
small the angular size to the observer

2903.77 --> 2908.06
might be twice as well because it's

2905.3 --> 2909.59
twice as far away roughly or something

2908.06 --> 2911.7799999999997
or even more because the optical slant

2909.59 --> 2914.84
point is pretty far away what the

2911.78 --> 2918.02
consumer is going to be twice because

2914.84 --> 2920.54
the concealment rate versus distance

2918.02 --> 2924.38
beyond the optical slam point is linear

2920.54 --> 2927.41
I have no absolute researched proof of

2924.38 --> 2929.9
this but it must be and that is my

2927.41 --> 2931.58
personal prediction that it started

2929.9 --> 2934.13
making three years ago without any

2931.58 --> 2936.89
empirical evidence to directly back it

2934.13 --> 2939.92
up but I can definitely say this is

2936.89 --> 2944.96
falsifiable and have challenged people

2939.92 --> 2950.21
out there Hey prove me wrong I've said

2944.96 --> 2954.32
it like 20 times a lot nobody even said

2950.21 --> 2955.79
all right nobody even responded not on

2954.32 --> 2958.4900000000002
the flat earth debate team

2955.79 --> 2962.42
not on any flat earther side not on the

2958.49 --> 2967.1
bowler side nobody ever responded to

2962.42 --> 2967.98
this linear concealment rate claim my

2967.1 --> 2971.43
claim claim

2967.98 --> 2974.01
Arwen linear consuming rate beyond the

2971.43 --> 2978.39
apparent optical slant point we know as

2974.01 --> 2982.1400000000003
the horizon things will be concealed at

2978.39 --> 2984.18
the linear rate versus the distance from

2982.14 --> 2987.96
the optical slant point on this is my

2984.18 --> 2992.6699999999996
claim it could be falsifiable I'd like

2987.96 --> 2995.67
people to try I'm not too enthusiastic

2992.67 --> 2997.77
to start trying it because yeah that

2995.67 --> 3003.5
would make me have to like travel and

2997.77 --> 3006.82
[ __ ] not now it's not the time but yeah

3003.5 --> 3009.59
there's hundreds of thousands of people

3006.82 --> 3011.51
with capability of doing these types of

3009.59 --> 3013.9700000000003
tests that actually know how to do it

3011.51 --> 3017.7700000000004
and know how to properly keep a registry

3013.97 --> 3022.7599999999998
of it keep a record and they could do it

3017.77 --> 3026.39
they could falsify my claim and say yeah

3022.76 --> 3029.48
our win that was pretty smart of you but

3026.39 --> 3031.31
you're wrong here's why it's not

3029.48 --> 3033.89
entirely linear here and there and

3031.31 --> 3036.35
that's why you know I'd love to hear

3033.89 --> 3040.2799999999997
this I'd love to this guy coming out of

3036.35 --> 3043.73
nowhere putting it down absolute detail

3040.28 --> 3048.07
and just like slapping Arwen in the face

3043.73 --> 3052.34
with his stupid claim I'd love to see it

3048.07 --> 3056.3900000000003
it's got to be real it's gotta be real I

3052.34 --> 3060.83
want to know what I've seen in my mind

3056.39 --> 3064.58
if that is real that is true in it it's

3060.83 --> 3067.22
the only logical explanation that I can

3064.58 --> 3070.72
think of for these very complex visual

3067.22 --> 3074.24
effects that are inherent to our sight

3070.72 --> 3076.54
they love to see if somebody can falsify

3074.24 --> 3076.54
it

3078.17 --> 3084.17
and now I'm sweating again thank you

3095.73 --> 3109.95
all right just gonna have to wait a

3102.04 --> 3109.95
little that's afraid not

3125.73 --> 3134.72
I yeah

3131.51 --> 3140.84
I think I even had a flat earth talks

3134.72 --> 3143.27
episode literally having the name D it

3140.84 --> 3145.9100000000003
was still obstruction rate then didn't

3143.27 --> 3148.34
properly rename it into consumer dread

3145.91 --> 3151.49
the obstruction rate beyond the optical

3148.34 --> 3154.76
sland is linear I even have a an entire

3151.49 --> 3157.1899999999996
show just with the title because I knew

3154.76 --> 3159.38
it's like yeah yeah yeah yeah I'm doing

3157.19 --> 3161.3
this I'm doing this right now when

3159.38 --> 3163.04
everybody's still all flustered up don't

3161.3 --> 3165.32
know what the hell is going on still

3163.04 --> 3167.57
holding up onto these old machinations

3165.32 --> 3169.1000000000004
yeah I'm going there yet to free four

3167.57 --> 3171.92
years ahead of everyone yeah doing it

3169.1 --> 3174.77
putting it right in the title right

3171.92 --> 3179.53
there let's see how long this is gonna

3174.77 --> 3179.53
take that's what I do

3187.309 --> 3198.8900000000003
oh I'm gonna round out the show soon got

3193.759 --> 3205.2690000000002
a few more minutes anything guys want me

3198.89 --> 3213.919
to dimension or special shoutouts

3205.269 --> 3217.959
requests shout out to the Big Bear Owen

3213.919 --> 3221.229
Benjamin of course always crushing it

3217.959 --> 3221.229
yesterday as well

3244.23 --> 3252.339
mmm-hmm yeah and that's right guns

3247.48 --> 3254.559
enough for an RMP so yeah thanks

3252.339 --> 3256.75
everyone for coming I hope you liked the

3254.559 --> 3258.6090000000004
show I thought it was pretty good if you

3256.75 --> 3259.839
did then please don't forget there opens

3258.609 --> 3261.46
it up and if you haven't already

3259.839 --> 3262.99

3261.46 --> 3264.9700000000003
bell notification so you know when I'm

3262.99 --> 3266.6499999999996
going live just normally 2:00 p.m.

3264.97 --> 3269.14
Amsterdam time every day

3266.65 --> 3272.29
please also do support me through the

3269.14 --> 3274.69
paypal patreon super chat and the

3272.29 --> 3277.69
membership system join button they'll be

3274.69 --> 3280.7200000000003
really appreciated kind of needed I'm

3277.69 --> 3285.04
still doing goods but yeah it needs

3280.72 --> 3287.6189999999997
support to keep me to keep me going and

3285.04 --> 3291.16
yeah so I don't slide all the way back

3287.619 --> 3293.559
again because yeah I'm still kind of

3291.16 --> 3295.839
dependent on just you all of you guys

3293.559 --> 3298.3
support and I know you keep it coming

3295.839 --> 3300.04
and I'm really really glad about it and

3298.3 --> 3303.54
thankful and I hope to keep up my

3300.04 --> 3306.04
performance even in crazy heat like this

3303.54 --> 3307.24
alright so I am going to be back

3306.04 --> 3309.97
tomorrow with Flat Earth

3307.24 --> 3312.609
early-bird number 580 and I'm gonna join

3309.97 --> 3313.93
the flattered debates right after this

3312.609 --> 3315.339
it should have start up in like two

3313.93 --> 3317.9199999999996
minutes

3315.339 --> 3322.96
hashtag meifa indeed

3317.92 --> 3329.48
Steve over moco right and until the next

3322.96 --> 3352.409
video keep it flat keep it cool

3329.48 --> 3352.409
[Music]

3355.05 --> 3357.11
