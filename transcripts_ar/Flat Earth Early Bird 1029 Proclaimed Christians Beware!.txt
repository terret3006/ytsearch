huh hello Cleary first in chat happy

87.299 --> 90.619
October yeah that's right

92.04 --> 97.82000000000001
a bit

93.36 --> 97.82
rainy October so far here

99.36 --> 104.64
big gray soup

102.42 --> 108.02
rain coming out every now and then

104.64 --> 108.02
although not constantly

112.92 --> 117.18
right

114.6 --> 120.119
most noticeably is like

117.18 --> 124.02000000000001
how much cooler it is colder it has

120.119 --> 125.82
become like for the last three days now

124.02 --> 127.979
so

125.82 --> 130.7
I'm probably gonna be wearing a sweater

127.979 --> 130.7
from now on

141.66 --> 144.739
because I don't think there's gonna be

143.459 --> 147.12
any more

144.739 --> 148.86
extraordinary after summer beautiful

147.12 --> 151.68
days

148.86 --> 155.18
in October that would be weird

151.68 --> 155.18
it has happened though

157.2 --> 160.45899999999997
but not for very long

166.62 --> 169.76
right so

170.34 --> 176.64000000000001
it is Friday the 1st of October 2021

178.56 --> 186.54
having a two-hour show maybe longer

182.34 --> 188.58
seeing that Nathan is not given any

186.54 --> 191.72
sign that he's going to do a live chat

188.58 --> 191.72
show today either

194.22 --> 197.659
hello Peaceful Warrior

200.159 --> 202.7
right

202.86 --> 207.92000000000002
uh

204.9 --> 207.92000000000002
hello clutch

216.599 --> 219.44
okay

221.459 --> 227.159
right uh

223.56 --> 230.42000000000002
uh yeah I was watching a video from Dell

227.159 --> 230.42
kind of unexpected

230.879 --> 234.07999999999998
very early today

234.72 --> 242.28
where he was going over a uh a video

239.4 --> 244.26000000000002
of Rand Paul

242.28 --> 246.659
I think it was like either in Congress

244.26 --> 249.26
or innocent it's probably Congress but

246.659 --> 249.26
he was

249.48 --> 256.139
he was like actively shaming flat

252.42 --> 259.079
earthers like using them as a

256.139 --> 263.46000000000004
as a straw man accusations to associate

259.079 --> 266.58
it with anti-science Believers basically

263.46 --> 268.25899999999996
and that's pretty pathetic to do that at

266.58 --> 270.85999999999996
this point

268.259 --> 270.86
so

271.919 --> 275.52
have been

273.3 --> 277.62
keeping a close eye on him for a long

275.52 --> 281.28
time

277.62 --> 283.759
it seems like he is regressing to

281.28 --> 283.75899999999996
basically

285.06 --> 290.28000000000003
the gay right wing

288.18 --> 293.46
although it's not like

290.28 --> 296.94
like that but it that's just the saying

293.46 --> 299.29999999999995
not saying he is literally gay but he's

296.94 --> 299.3
just

301.8 --> 307.5
he's following a strategy that I think

304.139 --> 310.699
is not very effective

307.5 --> 310.699
especially on the long run

310.919 --> 317.88
he's he's trying to calm the flock in a

314.46 --> 321.419
way and it's not the time for it

317.88 --> 324.24
right you can't win your trust back

321.419 --> 327.419
from the flock after this level of

324.24 --> 332.16
psychological attack operation

327.419 --> 334.32
like the V situation it doesn't work

332.16 --> 336.24
you got to get real that's the only way

334.32 --> 339.84
it works it's the only way you're gonna

336.24 --> 342.8
get any sort of trust from anybody

339.84 --> 345.479
that's real that's not just there to

342.8 --> 348.0
keep keep them corralled keep them

345.479 --> 350.28
corralled

348.0 --> 351.96
because that doesn't work now that

350.28 --> 354.29999999999995
doesn't work anymore I'm not saying

351.96 --> 358.15999999999997
it'll never ever work again but in a

354.3 --> 358.16
situation like that it doesn't work

359.1 --> 361.94
ah

362.819 --> 368.6
but yeah that was uh dell basically

366.0 --> 368.6
reviewed it

369.9 --> 374.4
and I thank him for reminding me about

372.18 --> 377.40000000000003
it I have not seen that

374.4 --> 378.78
live situation before so he dug it up

377.4 --> 382.46
somewhere

378.78 --> 382.46
I have not bumped into it

382.68 --> 388.88
like not bumped into it um

385.56 --> 388.88
Infowars anywhere

392.4 --> 395.06
right

397.259 --> 401.84000000000003
hello Matthew Mitchell Amanda Jung

406.44 --> 413.94
right

408.919 --> 415.68
so I'm having a bit of a back issue I

413.94 --> 419.96
think it is because the combination of

415.68 --> 419.96
the weather transition but also the

420.539 --> 426.599
the tension relief from yesterday

423.479 --> 429.38
because hey that happens

426.599 --> 432.0
I was expecting that it's it's part of

429.38 --> 435.24
stress reaction

432.0 --> 437.46
you know if it's very intense and then

435.24 --> 439.08
released then you even get like

437.46 --> 440.28
seriously ill

439.08 --> 441.96
now I don't think I'm gonna get

440.28 --> 443.88
seriously ill

441.96 --> 446.039
but I do have a bit of a back problem

443.88 --> 448.21999999999997
but I think actually it will just go

446.039 --> 448.21999999999997
away

450.56 --> 454.56
this is kind of weird when you sleep

453.36 --> 456.84000000000003
pretty well

454.56 --> 458.34
and then you still wake up just your

456.84 --> 460.13899999999995
back is not

458.34 --> 462.0
yeah

460.139 --> 463.68
it's not exactly right

462.0 --> 465.96
it's been worse though

463.68 --> 469.94
suddenly mild but it happened had any

465.96 --> 469.94
sort of backdraw in a long time

472.139 --> 478.16
I used to have that constantly

475.259 --> 478.16
10 years ago

483.96 --> 490.15999999999997
so all went through

485.94 --> 490.16
I think it did Matthew Mitchell

492.84 --> 496.61999999999995
and interestingly enough also yeah the

495.479 --> 501.44
bank

496.62 --> 504.0
like quickly put it like PayPal

501.44 --> 507.56
deposit it quickly on my bank so it

504.0 --> 507.56
arrived today actually it was

507.9 --> 510.919
very convenient

512.519 --> 517.979
right but as I already predicted

515.279 --> 521.539
yesterday like it's not gonna last me

517.979 --> 521.539
like a month okay

523.2 --> 526.82
but it will for a while

531.0 --> 535.38
and I thank you again

533.22 --> 537.0
especially Matthew Mitchell first time

535.38 --> 539.279
PayPal donator

537.0 --> 542.459
I really appreciate it

539.279 --> 544.68
and it was a sizable amount you have

542.459 --> 546.1199999999999
definitely earned your non-gay status

544.68 --> 551.18
for

546.12 --> 551.18
the next week yeah just kidding

551.7 --> 554.48
uh

554.82 --> 558.32
and so did you turn your weight

564.54 --> 567.1999999999999
right

567.42 --> 574.04
okay Ellen Benjamin also did a stream I

569.88 --> 574.04
did not get to watching it

575.399 --> 578.24
uh

578.519 --> 582.839
oh yeah I met you from Australia it is

580.86 --> 585.12
the 33rd

582.839 --> 588.1400000000001
flattered School show yesterday and he

585.12 --> 588.14
had Russian vids on

588.24 --> 594.9590000000001
Russian vids never came on my shirt well

590.82 --> 597.6600000000001
I never really communicated with him so

594.959 --> 601.079
it was very typical though

597.66 --> 603.36
I know it was a pretty decent show

601.079 --> 607.019
and I I just really like how well

603.36 --> 609.6
Mitchell is sharpened up to the

607.019 --> 611.4590000000001
the developments since then

609.6 --> 614.399
because

611.459 --> 616.14
Russian vids is

614.399 --> 618.48
old block

616.14 --> 621.36
and everybody from the old block has

618.48 --> 623.279
strong tendency to hold on to Old

621.36 --> 625.92
mechanisms because they worked for so

623.279 --> 629.64
long but Mitchell is very sharp and

625.92 --> 632.12
quick I really appreciate that about him

629.64 --> 632.12
like

632.82 --> 636.4200000000001
so

634.32 --> 640.82
anyway I don't have to be worried

636.42 --> 640.8199999999999
Mitchell will be fooled you see

641.279 --> 648.14
and that's a rare trait out there

644.7 --> 648.1400000000001
like he's Sharp

661.44 --> 666.5
hello jbdl 2021

673.32 --> 678.3000000000001
right so

674.94 --> 681.6
holding the fort here this week so it

678.3 --> 685.04
seemed kind of unannounced

681.6 --> 685.0400000000001
but holding the four here

690.899 --> 697.26
and yeah I'm dude it's Friday it can be

694.86 --> 699.5600000000001
pretty much about anything you want to

697.26 --> 699.56
talk about

700.62 --> 705.839
my tension management is a lot better

702.899 --> 708.3
today than it was yesterday you know

705.839 --> 710.7600000000001
and that simply means that I can just

708.3 --> 714.54
handle more

710.76 --> 716.1
without getting like weird fatigue

714.54 --> 717.66
moments because that did happen

716.1 --> 719.7
yesterday too

717.66 --> 721.62
and it has happened in the past I don't

719.7 --> 725.1
know if you guys even pay attention like

721.62 --> 727.98
I feel it I try not to be like oh no I'm

725.1 --> 729.72
fatiguing I'm not trying to make a drama

727.98 --> 731.76
out of it but it is something that just

729.72 --> 733.86
happens

731.76 --> 736.3199999999999
I've explained it many times it's the

733.86 --> 740.399
financial stress I've always been very

736.32 --> 743.339
upfront about just the setup

740.399 --> 744.6
the conditions for me doing what I do on

743.339 --> 747.7790000000001
the show

744.6 --> 752.4590000000001
and that's all real nothing about that

747.779 --> 756.8389999999999
is theatrical or contrived built by me

752.459 --> 759.0189999999999
to to wheel in the hole in the money or

756.839 --> 759.019
anything

760.2 --> 767.5400000000001
it's just that's what it all is that's

762.899 --> 767.54
what how it works for me what happens

770.22 --> 776.1600000000001
and I think that most of you here that

773.279 --> 778.579
have witnessed me for a long time they

776.16 --> 778.579
know that

781.56 --> 787.4399999999999
you know how Arwen works

784.86 --> 790.399
at least in ways you know what to expect

787.44 --> 790.399
and you know

791.519 --> 797.16
what to expect

794.279 --> 799.76
that you don't expect from me as well I

797.16 --> 799.76
think by now

812.279 --> 817.26
yeah thank you Matthew Mitchell well

814.98 --> 819.54
honesty yeah

817.26 --> 822.199
you know I don't even function without

819.54 --> 822.199
honesty

822.36 --> 825.54
like

823.5 --> 827.399
all the energy that I kind of

825.54 --> 829.74
desperately need for what I do

827.399 --> 833.04
spiritually mentally

829.74 --> 835.62
like if I am dishonest

833.04 --> 837.0
or like if I choose to be superficially

835.62 --> 840.0600000000001
deceptive

837.0 --> 844.579
then literally that cuts into my energy

840.06 --> 844.579
reserves in that moment and Beyond

847.079 --> 852.3599999999999
and I've just learned like yeah you can

850.74 --> 854.339
just be honest

852.36 --> 857.9590000000001
if you're very careful

854.339 --> 857.9590000000001
then you don't have that problem

858.24 --> 862.32
but you effectively have to function on

860.82 --> 865.44
a higher level and take more

862.32 --> 867.9200000000001
responsibility even over others where

865.44 --> 867.9200000000001
they don't

870.0 --> 877.339
otherwise you're you're gonna bump into

873.18 --> 877.3389999999999
situations right anyway

894.3 --> 899.8389999999999
wow that's just that's a weird dream

897.06 --> 899.8389999999999
jbdl

900.44 --> 904.32
you drew you dreamed that I was just

903.24 --> 907.26
here

904.32 --> 909.4200000000001
doing my show and then a robber sneaked

907.26 --> 911.04
on behind me and what did they even

909.42 --> 914.899
steal

911.04 --> 914.899
like did they take my bow or something

919.32 --> 923.6990000000001
that's a very typical dream I believe

921.6 --> 925.9200000000001
that you could have had that dream I've

923.699 --> 928.16
had those types of weird silly dreams

925.92 --> 928.16
too

931.8 --> 936.779
like about others

934.56 --> 940.56
where you just like really sympathize

936.779 --> 942.48
with them but that somebody likes they

940.56 --> 943.38
were a Grappler would be sneaking up on

942.48 --> 945.24
them

943.38 --> 947.519
to try to pickpocket them or something

945.24 --> 949.0790000000001
and you saw it

947.519 --> 951.3
and like

949.079 --> 952.8
that I wouldn't be allowed to warn them

951.3 --> 954.7199999999999
or something

952.8 --> 957.54
but I would like try to hint with him

954.72 --> 959.639
with my eye motion like from the first

957.54 --> 961.98
person perspective in that dream exist

959.639 --> 965.339
be like oh watch out but you couldn't

961.98 --> 968.399
like actively stop anything I've had

965.339 --> 971.48
those types of dreams too it's really

968.399 --> 971.48
there's something else

973.079 --> 976.92
oh it's very frustrating by the way in a

975.18 --> 979.579
way

976.92 --> 979.579
uh

989.759 --> 996.899
thoughts on the reason for some people

992.16 --> 1000.5
discourage others from going to church

996.899 --> 1003.68
that is it part is it because they are

1000.5 --> 1007.1
not part of their Community not liked

1003.68 --> 1009.9799999999999
why do you fear congregation with others

1007.1 --> 1012.5600000000001
I don't fear congregation with others I

1009.98 --> 1014.66
just don't like

1012.56 --> 1017.42
priest devils

1014.66 --> 1018.8
that literally try to mind control you

1017.42 --> 1021.5
into

1018.8 --> 1025.3999999999999
peer pressure mind control you into like

1021.5 --> 1028.459
yeah until you accept that chant we're

1025.4 --> 1030.439
gonna give you the evil eye yeah that's

1028.459 --> 1033.98
what I don't like

1030.439 --> 1037.1000000000001
I really don't like that

1033.98 --> 1039.679
I find it extremely repulsive

1037.1 --> 1041.059
in ways I'd rather hang around with

1039.679 --> 1044.299
atheists

1041.059 --> 1046.4189999999999
than with Christians that do that you

1044.299 --> 1046.4189999999999
understand

1051.799 --> 1054.52
ah

1054.86 --> 1059.539
and it did in the past not that atheists

1058.039 --> 1061.28
are all that great they're they're

1059.539 --> 1064.12
totally deluded

1061.28 --> 1064.12
many ways

1070.22 --> 1073.369
[Music]

1092.0 --> 1096.679
hey star water

1094.46 --> 1100.059
the Church of entertainment does not

1096.679 --> 1100.0590000000002
serve the needs of my spirit

1118.55 --> 1121.7
[Music]

1122.24 --> 1124.84
right

1132.26 --> 1136.0
punching someone in a dream never goes

1134.419 --> 1138.5590000000002
well

1136.0 --> 1141.32
well it's weird Peaceful Warrior I've

1138.559 --> 1143.24
had that in one one time where I would

1141.32 --> 1145.039
just

1143.24 --> 1148.16
like

1145.039 --> 1150.62
do it anyway but then I literally like

1148.16 --> 1153.0800000000002
end up punching the wall waking up like

1150.62 --> 1155.4189999999999
oh [ __ ] I just punched the wall I didn't

1153.08 --> 1158.539
even realize it

1155.419 --> 1161.179
because when you start to physically

1158.539 --> 1163.28
like really decisively act in a dream

1161.179 --> 1166.1000000000001
usually

1163.28 --> 1168.32
that also switches on your body control

1166.1 --> 1170.0
right because in the dream you feel like

1168.32 --> 1171.4399999999998
oh I don't have control of my body yeah

1170.0 --> 1173.36
because you don't because you're in a

1171.44 --> 1175.28
dream but if you realize that you don't

1173.36 --> 1177.799
have like a virtual body that you have

1175.28 --> 1178.94
free control over which you usually

1177.799 --> 1182.12
don't

1178.94 --> 1184.3400000000001
then if you take control in the dream

1182.12 --> 1186.62
want to do something physical it often

1184.34 --> 1189.26
switches on

1186.62 --> 1191.299
the the actual mechanisms in your body

1189.26 --> 1193.16
and then you end up punching a wall or

1191.299 --> 1195.4
something

1193.16 --> 1195.4
foreign

1214.6 --> 1219.1399999999999
can you be a little bit more specific

1216.799 --> 1223.46
because there's many reasons why not to

1219.14 --> 1225.919
go to these modern churches

1223.46 --> 1227.78
right

1225.919 --> 1230.0590000000002
it all depends if they're just saying

1227.78 --> 1232.82
like no don't go to any church or Christ

1230.059 --> 1237.6399999999999
is bad or

1232.82 --> 1237.6399999999999
or delusional or whatever wrong

1238.039 --> 1243.62
and just pointing out like yeah these

1240.62 --> 1245.9599999999998
these churches they're corrupt

1243.62 --> 1249.1999999999998
don't go there right so it all depends

1245.96 --> 1251.44
on exactly what you mean when you say

1249.2 --> 1251.44
that

1259.64 --> 1264.5
you can meet with a few Christians and

1262.039 --> 1266.679
that's Church yeah clutch I agree with

1264.5 --> 1266.679
that

1266.919 --> 1271.8200000000002
neo-christian E I just call him

1270.2 --> 1275.78
Christians

1271.82 --> 1275.78
it's just sheep

1277.88 --> 1283.7600000000002
it's the flock that relinquished their

1281.419 --> 1288.26
their Godly connection to a priesthood

1283.76 --> 1289.94
they literally don't want to burden

1288.26 --> 1294.44
in a way they want to be spiritually

1289.94 --> 1297.799
enslaved and it is that it exists

1294.44 --> 1302.059
it doesn't that mechanism

1297.799 --> 1304.8799999999999
doesn't always have to be a bad thing

1302.059 --> 1307.1
because it's also just about trust and

1304.88 --> 1310.2800000000002
group mechanics but hey if there is a

1307.1 --> 1312.74
priesthood that you then relinquish that

1310.28 --> 1315.86
to and there

1312.74 --> 1317.84
not really being all occupied with being

1315.86 --> 1320.299
Christian and having a flock like that

1317.84 --> 1322.1589999999999
but rather with how do I keep control

1320.299 --> 1326.72
how do I

1322.159 --> 1332.0800000000002
keep my tax exemption status etc etc

1326.72 --> 1332.08
then yeah it becomes a bad pen

1365.059 --> 1369.44
hmm

1367.039 --> 1372.32
yeah that's a good one Peaceful Warrior

1369.44 --> 1374.8400000000001
yeah that's that's like really the the

1372.32 --> 1377.059
Christ methodology

1374.84 --> 1379.1
like don't destroy the evil because

1377.059 --> 1381.98
there's always there always will be evil

1379.1 --> 1385.1589999999999
and there will be evil it will be back

1381.98 --> 1387.559
like even sometimes

1385.159 --> 1390.94
within the next Generations they will

1387.559 --> 1390.94
stand up again it will just happen

1391.34 --> 1395.9599999999998
but if you instead overcome evil with

1394.76 --> 1397.8799999999999
good

1395.96 --> 1400.82
with

1397.88 --> 1402.3200000000002
giving them the opportunity to let go of

1400.82 --> 1404.78
the

1402.32 --> 1407.84
the shackles

1404.78 --> 1411.08
Tentacles from the darkness

1407.84 --> 1413.1789999999999
then those who you thought were your

1411.08 --> 1416.299
enemy might turn into your friends and

1413.179 --> 1418.64
they will still pay for their sins

1416.299 --> 1421.82
in their life nobody else has to do that

1418.64 --> 1423.6200000000001
often oh yeah they've gone like way

1421.82 --> 1425.6
overboard of course

1423.62 --> 1427.9599999999998
fine and all satanic yeah that's another

1425.6 --> 1427.9599999999998
matter

1429.26 --> 1434.679
right but it is about the mythology

1431.0 --> 1434.679
methodology and I agree

1444.26 --> 1449.9
so are you are you addressing me now

1447.08 --> 1452.84
Aries curse of man

1449.9 --> 1456.039
are you are are you talking to me

1452.84 --> 1456.039
are you talking to me

1458.96 --> 1466.1200000000001
because I get the feeling here

1461.779 --> 1466.12
straw Manning me a lot

1481.46 --> 1487.58
are my expenditures and smoke cannabis

1483.86 --> 1490.4189999999999
and alcohol pretty high compared to food

1487.58 --> 1490.4189999999999
ah

1493.039 --> 1497.32
I think it's about 50 50.

1500.24 --> 1508.34
that it differs per period sometimes it

1504.32 --> 1511.52
just like it it really starts

1508.34 --> 1513.74
pulling on me and then I like smoke more

1511.52 --> 1516.679
and that's expensive but I have been

1513.74 --> 1519.5
cutting down for a while taking it easy

1516.679 --> 1522.3400000000001
and my alcohol expenses are just not

1519.5 --> 1522.34
it's almost nothing

1539.48 --> 1544.94
okay beginning to feel that pineal

1542.659 --> 1547.5800000000002
Christians anti-christians working

1544.94 --> 1550.419
against yeah but who are you talking

1547.58 --> 1550.4189999999999
about Aries

1552.559 --> 1554.74
foreign

1558.46 --> 1563.96
and in a way if you're talking about

1561.559 --> 1568.039
mega churches

1563.96 --> 1571.299
and all that the like gay accepting

1568.039 --> 1571.299
churches and all that

1571.52 --> 1577.299
churches that accept sin and don't even

1574.7 --> 1579.4
recognize it as a sin right those things

1577.299 --> 1582.08
they're not

1579.4 --> 1584.5
anti-christian they're just not really

1582.08 --> 1584.5
Christian

1587.179 --> 1591.26
they are kind of like

1589.76 --> 1595.34
how

1591.26 --> 1597.2
well grabblers tend to call themselves

1595.34 --> 1599.059
you know what

1597.2 --> 1602.98
certain religion

1599.059 --> 1602.98
but in reality they aren't

1604.82 --> 1609.98
there's something else now those

1607.279 --> 1613.179
really actively take that as cover it's

1609.98 --> 1616.58
different it's like

1613.179 --> 1618.5590000000002
home-based safety for the Grapplers but

1616.58 --> 1622.58
with the churches

1618.559 --> 1624.799
it's it's it's like a corporation it's

1622.58 --> 1627.1999999999998
just a an exploit

1624.799 --> 1629.96
based on religion

1627.2 --> 1632.539
that's it really it's not really like

1629.96 --> 1634.94
super Grabbers or anything some of them

1632.539 --> 1637.24
might be pretty damn evil and Drunk on

1634.94 --> 1637.24
Power

1639.08 --> 1646.6399999999999
right it is kind of a Grappler setup

1643.52 --> 1649.34
but it's basically just

1646.64 --> 1653.3600000000001
a church exploit

1649.34 --> 1656.1789999999999
supply and demand people want to do that

1653.36 --> 1659.9599999999998
and apparently they're not really all

1656.179 --> 1661.76
that sharp or caring about the details

1659.96 --> 1663.2
they just want to come together they

1661.76 --> 1665.899
just want to feel like they're

1663.2 --> 1667.64
Christians on the surface in ways and

1665.899 --> 1669.1999999999998
they don't really pay attention to the

1667.64 --> 1671.779
details They Don't Really spiritually

1669.2 --> 1673.64
develop they probably barely even have

1671.779 --> 1676.419
philosophical discussions among one

1673.64 --> 1676.419
another in church

1676.64 --> 1681.919
or maybe they do it all depends on how

1679.34 --> 1683.799
that unrolls

1681.919 --> 1687.26
how the management

1683.799 --> 1688.94
organizes that is it open philosophical

1687.26 --> 1691.82
discussion do people really have the

1688.94 --> 1693.74
room to get their their completely their

1691.82 --> 1696.9189999999999
own ideas out

1693.74 --> 1699.88
or is it oh we must talk about this

1696.919 --> 1699.88
subject now

1701.24 --> 1706.76
where you're just supposed to

1703.76 --> 1709.34
virtue signal all the time that you get

1706.76 --> 1711.799
it like how they

1709.34 --> 1714.559
want the atmosphere to be how they want

1711.799 --> 1717.559
everybody to think right it all depends

1714.559 --> 1721.24
on how it's organized

1717.559 --> 1721.24
gravel gravel gravel

1739.159 --> 1744.8200000000002
okay plunder 23 that's an interesting

1742.159 --> 1744.8200000000002
analysis

1762.98 --> 1769.24
yes Matthew Mitchell yeah yeah

1765.98 --> 1769.24
idolize the Bible

1769.46 --> 1775.299
and suit find the verses that suit their

1772.64 --> 1775.2990000000002
stance yes

1775.76 --> 1781.22
that's but that's what to be fair that's

1778.76 --> 1783.62
what most Christians end up doing after

1781.22 --> 1786.679
they've been convinced into the Priestly

1783.62 --> 1788.12
trick only the Bible everything you ever

1786.679 --> 1789.8600000000001
need is in the Bible well guess what

1788.12 --> 1792.3799999999999
you're gonna do then if you believe that

1789.86 --> 1794.84
if you sign on to that you're gonna look

1792.38 --> 1799.48
for everything you need in the Bible

1794.84 --> 1799.48
yeah that what do you expect you know

1799.58 --> 1805.58
what did you expect

1801.32 --> 1809.48
what how else could it unroll then

1805.58 --> 1812.6589999999999
it couldn't because you've assigned on

1809.48 --> 1815.8990000000001
to this is the only Authority

1812.659 --> 1818.2
a a blank check statement

1815.899 --> 1820.76
that literally just in your heart

1818.2 --> 1822.38
polarizes that book versus everything

1820.76 --> 1823.94
else

1822.38 --> 1825.919
yeah what do you think you're going to

1823.94 --> 1828.14
end up doing of course you're gonna look

1825.919 --> 1830.3600000000001
into that Bible and then find everything

1828.14 --> 1832.1000000000001
you need for

1830.36 --> 1835.539
for the moment

1832.1 --> 1835.539
that's what you end up doing

1853.279 --> 1858.08
that's ridiculous

1855.2 --> 1860.8400000000001
New World Order religion that changes

1858.08 --> 1862.36
nothing can change Christianity Aries

1860.84 --> 1866.539
curse event

1862.36 --> 1869.36
Christianity as we have as we grow up in

1866.539 --> 1870.86
it was changed the second

1869.36 --> 1874.1789999999999
Christ

1870.86 --> 1874.1789999999999
went off the scene

1874.519 --> 1879.32
right when he went away what do you

1876.86 --> 1882.019
think happened immediately everything

1879.32 --> 1885.9189999999999
got corrupted and

1882.019 --> 1889.519
put into a religious format

1885.919 --> 1893.48
can't destroy that's the whole point

1889.519 --> 1896.659
oh oh if they changed it forever oh well

1893.48 --> 1899.24
they do that all the time sort of

1896.659 --> 1902.48
they've taken like what is it a thousand

1899.24 --> 1905.1200000000001
two thousand years to do that constantly

1902.48 --> 1908.779
what do you think why do you think

1905.12 --> 1911.059
that would certainly be the end

1908.779 --> 1914.96
when they do it constantly

1911.059 --> 1919.1589999999999
throughout history you can't destroy

1914.96 --> 1921.98
Christ's Legacy because it is it is and

1919.159 --> 1923.659
nothing that organized religion could do

1921.98 --> 1926.919
could change it

1923.659 --> 1926.919
because it is

1933.98 --> 1941.2
oh guns of nephron

1937.22 --> 1941.2
I will check my PayPal

1946.46 --> 1952.179
yes thank you

1949.1 --> 1952.1789999999999
thank you

1962.919 --> 1969.1000000000001
sadly it's like a dam breaking through

1966.919 --> 1971.659
and everybody comes

1969.1 --> 1973.039
bringing it thank you very much guns

1971.659 --> 1976.0590000000002
have never run rmp for your

1973.039 --> 1976.059
long-standing support

1980.96 --> 1984.6200000000001
I think guns have never owned my

1982.34 --> 1987.6999999999998
together with Dank might have been among

1984.62 --> 1987.6999999999998
my first supporters

1993.62 --> 1996.82
a little gaining wisdom

1998.299 --> 2003.84
what's that clutch

2001.0 --> 2003.84
set link

2008.919 --> 2012.519
oh God

2010.539 --> 2014.99
shouty

2012.519 --> 2017.08
hey shouty video

2014.99 --> 2020.799
[Music]

2017.08 --> 2023.62
so I see capital letters and exclamation

2020.799 --> 2026.76
marks and 666 so I already know what

2023.62 --> 2026.76
kind of video that is

2028.299 --> 2034.72
a link I posted it oh you want a a

2032.62 --> 2037.36
a doom church then

2034.72 --> 2039.58
that's constantly like ah the devil is

2037.36 --> 2043.36
coming repents

2039.58 --> 2045.9399999999998
I guess it does have its appeal in a way

2043.36 --> 2047.1399999999999
sometimes

2045.94 --> 2051.359
and

2047.14 --> 2051.359
it could be considered more real

2052.599 --> 2056.2000000000003
a brimstone Church

2054.7 --> 2061.48
that's probably what it should be called

2056.2 --> 2063.46
but still yet it does kind of like

2061.48 --> 2065.7400000000002
pacify people little and make them

2063.46 --> 2068.079
paranoid so

2065.74 --> 2071.0789999999997
yeah you end up with a different type of

2068.079 --> 2075.52
community in that

2071.079 --> 2080.7000000000003
the link is the wrong one okay

2075.52 --> 2080.7
brilliant just freaking brilliant dude

2090.7 --> 2093.2999999999997
it's

2093.7 --> 2099.7599999999998
that's what you meant to share okay

2097.48 --> 2102.42
carbon credit

2099.76 --> 2102.42
oh

2117.339 --> 2121.54
okay

2119.26 --> 2124.26
flicking through that

2121.54 --> 2124.2599999999998
yeah maybe

2128.26 --> 2133.119
on the surface I can't see anything

2129.94 --> 2135.579
directly wrong with it

2133.119 --> 2138.099
it seems more like just a lecture though

2135.579 --> 2140.5600000000004
it's just like oh check it out there's

2138.099 --> 2143.099
developments here is what you got to be

2140.56 --> 2143.099
careful of

2144.22 --> 2148.18
it's not is that really a church

2145.96 --> 2149.5
congregation though

2148.18 --> 2151.839
I don't know

2149.5 --> 2154.0
I'd have to actually watch it to me to

2151.839 --> 2156.54
make sure

2154.0 --> 2156.54
anyway

2176.619 --> 2182.7000000000003
Celtic polytheism

2180.22 --> 2182.7
what

2182.98 --> 2184.98
what

2186.46 --> 2189.3
why

2194.92 --> 2199.7200000000003
seriously why

2196.78 --> 2202.119
why would you go to polytheism why why

2199.72 --> 2203.2599999999998
would you do that at this point

2202.119 --> 2206.04
why

2203.26 --> 2206.0400000000004
what's the point

2220.42 --> 2226.119
it all adds up to paganism to me yeah

2223.72 --> 2229.24
but it isn't paganism

2226.119 --> 2231.48
it isn't actually paganism Aries curse

2229.24 --> 2231.4799999999996
of men

2233.44 --> 2241.92
you know paganism has its own Traditions

2237.28 --> 2241.92
its own setups and its own icons

2243.82 --> 2250.06
it's not necessarily bad it could be bad

2246.82 --> 2253.42
though it has exploitability for

2250.06 --> 2256.32
priesthood just like Christianity or the

2253.42 --> 2256.32
the yeah

2257.26 --> 2264.6400000000003
what it became out there the churches

2261.339 --> 2266.32
it's it it doesn't make it Pig like

2264.64 --> 2269.3799999999997
people saying

2266.32 --> 2274.32
this is not proper Christianity so it

2269.38 --> 2274.32
must be paganism oh really

2275.2 --> 2279.5789999999997
doesn't seem like you really understand

2276.94 --> 2283.06
what paganism is then like actual

2279.579 --> 2286.3
paganism and not like oh look we we did

2283.06 --> 2288.339
a Satan stamp on it oh yeah it's been

2286.3 --> 2290.98
happening for like a thousand years yeah

2288.339 --> 2293.5
yeah and now it is bad

2290.98 --> 2294.7
so we're gonna call it Pagan call it

2293.5 --> 2297.579
Satanic

2294.7 --> 2302.9399999999996
right that's much more appropriate and

2297.579 --> 2302.94
even loyal to the lore itself

2311.74 --> 2317.2599999999998
little God's Doctrine is pregnant yeah

2314.98 --> 2319.68
that depends on what they're gonna do

2317.26 --> 2319.6800000000003
with it

2321.16 --> 2323.7
right

2328.42 --> 2334.6800000000003
I'm not saying like oh I am

2331.32 --> 2334.6800000000003
saying that

2335.5 --> 2341.26
pan pantheonism

2337.839 --> 2344.2599999999998
is better no no no no no no no it's it's

2341.26 --> 2348.4
in a way a distraction but it

2344.26 --> 2352.119
it is just another corner

2348.4 --> 2355.1800000000003
of reflection on things and

2352.119 --> 2357.4
there are stories that utilize the the

2355.18 --> 2360.8199999999997
little G gods

2357.4 --> 2363.3
or you could say almost like masks

2360.82 --> 2366.88
masks rolls

2363.3 --> 2369.1600000000003
of appointees by God

2366.88 --> 2371.6800000000003
that can be even against God doesn't

2369.16 --> 2374.52
matter like they are just another level

2371.68 --> 2374.52
of players

2376.359 --> 2381.2799999999997
and they have relationships and when you

2379.24 --> 2384.04
consider that that's how a lot of people

2381.28 --> 2386.1400000000003
learn back in the day just how complex

2384.04 --> 2388.359
social dynamics are

2386.14 --> 2391.42
through those icons

2388.359 --> 2393.52
they learned about reality and about how

2391.42 --> 2396.54
things unfold

2393.52 --> 2396.54
because of it

2400.66 --> 2406.92
so it's just it's not something else

2404.079 --> 2406.92
it's different

2406.96 --> 2412.3
right and monotheism

2409.78 --> 2414.76
has always kind of emphasized more the

2412.3 --> 2417.1600000000003
personal relationship like the actual

2414.76 --> 2420.7000000000003
individual being present there to hear

2417.16 --> 2422.7999999999997
it their relationship directly right and

2420.7 --> 2424.0
that is more advisable that's what Jesus

2422.8 --> 2427.5600000000004
advised

2424.0 --> 2427.56
and I recognize that

2428.02 --> 2433.66
it brings it closer it brings it closer

2430.18 --> 2436.54
to personal responsibility Focus inward

2433.66 --> 2440.02
Focus confronting yourself with the

2436.54 --> 2441.94
obstacles right and pantheism tends to

2440.02 --> 2444.64
do that less

2441.94 --> 2447.2200000000003
because it kind of takes away from the

2444.64 --> 2449.5
direct God creator ultimate being

2447.22 --> 2452.859
relationship and you

2449.5 --> 2456.94
and like shows like the sub gods and

2452.859 --> 2459.94
what they do how they do it and how does

2456.94 --> 2461.92
that reflect on on things happening or

2459.94 --> 2464.7400000000002
maybe even personal life social

2461.92 --> 2467.44
situations right it's different it's

2464.74 --> 2471.04
just different

2467.44 --> 2474.839
right and even like the Catholic Church

2471.04 --> 2478.48
has tried to assimilate that very field

2474.839 --> 2480.88
through the concept of saints

2478.48 --> 2483.7
right sub things

2480.88 --> 2487.9
that are still powerful and then you use

2483.7 --> 2491.98
them in story contexts to reflect upon

2487.9 --> 2494.56
it's it's the same mechanism they the

2491.98 --> 2497.859
Catholic Church

2494.56 --> 2500.52
wasn't Pagan they just assimilated

2497.859 --> 2500.52
paganism

2500.68 --> 2505.6189999999997
because I fundamentally think that they

2503.319 --> 2505.619
were

2505.8 --> 2512.8590000000004
straightforward satanic like the satanic

2509.92 --> 2515.7400000000002
like literally Satan standing over their

2512.859 --> 2518.14
shoulders saying you are going to do

2515.74 --> 2520.6189999999997
this you are going to take power after

2518.14 --> 2520.6189999999997
the coming

2521.68 --> 2528.8799999999997
of the best of us and you will do

2525.4 --> 2531.64
exactly what he said not to do before

2528.88 --> 2533.38
it's too late before everybody wisens up

2531.64 --> 2535.18
too much and you won't be able to do it

2533.38 --> 2538.1800000000003
they had to do it immediately

2535.18 --> 2538.18
immediately

2539.26 --> 2546.7000000000003
Breakout take over

2542.68 --> 2548.16
and capsulate the true wisdom of Jesus

2546.7 --> 2551.319
before

2548.16 --> 2554.0789999999997
it would spread and settle

2551.319 --> 2555.4
in the minds and hearts of people you

2554.079 --> 2558.28
see

2555.4 --> 2559.3
anyways it still did spread and sadly

2558.28 --> 2561.76
people

2559.3 --> 2564.7000000000003
but because they the Catholic church

2561.76 --> 2567.5200000000004
manifested so early they simply went to

2564.7 --> 2571.18
theocracy and just took control rigidly

2567.52 --> 2575.46
like Satan would do with murder and

2571.18 --> 2575.46
blackmail and everything you can imagine

2575.859 --> 2581.02
torture

2577.66 --> 2583.7999999999997
just for power just power power over the

2581.02 --> 2586.839
spirit absolute theocracy absolutely

2583.8 --> 2589.42
satanic as can be

2586.839 --> 2592.06
and it doesn't mean that everybody ever

2589.42 --> 2594.4
involved with that church

2592.06 --> 2596.14
was evil

2594.4 --> 2598.599
they wouldn't necessarily have to know

2596.14 --> 2601.72
and hey these things these organizations

2598.599 --> 2603.3
these power organizations through

2601.72 --> 2608.02
religion

2603.3 --> 2610.599
they need good people

2608.02 --> 2613.78
to actually do good

2610.599 --> 2616.48
as a cover because if they didn't have

2613.78 --> 2617.8590000000004
any of that the entire thing would turn

2616.48 --> 2620.38
into it

2617.859 --> 2622.42
eternally collapsing black hole and get

2620.38 --> 2624.4
people killed and then get everybody to

2622.42 --> 2627.2200000000003
hate them they would have to have good

2624.4 --> 2629.44
people that didn't know where they are

2627.22 --> 2633.3999999999996
what the thing is their part of is

2629.44 --> 2637.119
really and be good to represent the good

2633.4 --> 2640.0
face of the organization it's critical

2637.119 --> 2642.96
without those people it would have all

2640.0 --> 2647.64
collapsed and just everybody would be

2642.96 --> 2647.64
murdered and [ __ ] and escaping and

2647.8 --> 2653.38
right it could only have ever worked

2650.74 --> 2655.4799999999996
because there were good people

2653.38 --> 2657.579
in there as well

2655.48 --> 2659.68
and there must always be good people in

2657.579 --> 2662.6400000000003
there because if they're not

2659.68 --> 2662.64
it's done for

2672.46 --> 2674.94
right

2684.579 --> 2688.319
a pizza crew Shank

2701.8 --> 2709.2400000000002
Jesus what's the biggest cynic no

2706.48 --> 2710.68
nailed to the cross said to himself how

2709.24 --> 2713.2599999999998
do you

2710.68 --> 2716.56
really

2713.26 --> 2718.48
you know of his internal dialogue to you

2716.56 --> 2721.06
you think he would

2718.48 --> 2724.42
think Petty things

2721.06 --> 2728.02
in his moment of death to no Jesus was

2724.42 --> 2730.599
not a gamma he's not going to be oh look

2728.02 --> 2735.18
I'm being nailed to the cross all the

2730.599 --> 2739.3
stupid people oh no

2735.18 --> 2742.14
what a Preposterous idea sorry plunder

2739.3 --> 2742.1400000000003
it's no way

2749.38 --> 2755.8
at best he would have just worried like

2753.16 --> 2758.2
is this gonna work is

2755.8 --> 2761.26
is my teachings going to be able to pull

2758.2 --> 2764.02
through or will it be shredded

2761.26 --> 2767.8190000000004
after I leave the scene

2764.02 --> 2767.819
I think that was his biggest concern

2782.8 --> 2786.76
no yeah I'm giving you a timeout for

2785.619 --> 2791.6800000000003
that

2786.76 --> 2795.1800000000003
no chanting in here Fundy

2791.68 --> 2795.18
no chanting in here

2804.22 --> 2809.0789999999997
first you you quote Jesus and then you

2807.28 --> 2812.28
have the balls

2809.079 --> 2815.8
in the same sentence to immediately

2812.28 --> 2818.98
insinuate your chant [ __ ] human

2815.8 --> 2821.819
sacrifice belief condition you funny

2818.98 --> 2821.819
scum

2826.54 --> 2832.96
no chanting here

2830.079 --> 2835.42
next time you're banned I don't care how

2832.96 --> 2838.14
[ __ ] nice and Christian you think you

2835.42 --> 2838.14
are okay

2841.17 --> 2844.59
[Music]

2844.599 --> 2852.04
quote Jesus and then just leave it to

2848.26 --> 2856.0
what Jesus said don't you freaking dare

2852.04 --> 2860.02
tie in your disgusting little praise

2856.0 --> 2862.8
chance about human sacrifice to that you

2860.02 --> 2862.8
hear me funny

2897.099 --> 2904.9
yeah when he says no man

2900.64 --> 2909.1189999999997
comes to God unless through me

2904.9 --> 2913.6600000000003
who are you to say that that is actually

2909.119 --> 2918.4
pointing by his own mouth at his future

2913.66 --> 2921.04
death and how it's him him humanly

2918.4 --> 2925.599
sacrificed

2921.04 --> 2929.02
it's going to save you it's disgusting

2925.599 --> 2930.339
how dare you

2929.02 --> 2933.099
yeah

2930.339 --> 2935.92
no when he says that

2933.099 --> 2939.059
talking through his about his teachings

2935.92 --> 2942.94
through his wisdom through what he has

2939.059 --> 2946.6600000000003
given you that's the path those are the

2942.94 --> 2950.02
methods to which you can come to God and

2946.66 --> 2953.6189999999997
it's the only method not you believing

2950.02 --> 2957.819
it was a freaking human sacrifice

2953.619 --> 2960.4
to change the design of the world

2957.819 --> 2961.48
so that you can squirt and still go to

2960.4 --> 2963.1600000000003
heaven

2961.48 --> 2967.119
no

2963.16 --> 2969.7599999999998
it's entirely twisted like every part of

2967.119 --> 2973.079
it is it twisted and untrue every part

2969.76 --> 2973.079
it's so twisted

2974.319 --> 2981.2799999999997
you can't escape your sins you pay for

2976.72 --> 2983.9199999999996
your sins it's inherent to the system

2981.28 --> 2986.8590000000004
and the only way to escape it

2983.92 --> 2989.44
is through delusion through Satan

2986.859 --> 2991.839
through belief in your head that it

2989.44 --> 2994.2400000000002
doesn't exist or that it's okay or

2991.839 --> 2997.66
whatever Escape escape from reality

2994.24 --> 3000.0
White Noise yeah that's the only way to

2997.66 --> 3001.44
escape sins but you can't escape since

3000.0 --> 3005.46
you can only

3001.44 --> 3008.579
postpone them from your conscious

3005.46 --> 3010.619
you pay for your sin nothing has ever

3008.579 --> 3012.78
changed that nothing ever will that's

3010.619 --> 3014.88
how the design of this realm works

3012.78 --> 3017.579
that's how the spirit Mechanics Work

3014.88 --> 3019.44
there's nothing that could ever have

3017.579 --> 3021.9
been done about it

3019.44 --> 3024.359
because that's how it works

3021.9 --> 3027.839
what can be done however

3024.359 --> 3029.7599999999998
is sharing of insights and wisdom

3027.839 --> 3033.48
methods

3029.76 --> 3035.8190000000004
that can get you closer to God the

3033.48 --> 3040.92
teachings that can get you closer to God

3035.819 --> 3044.04
not chance no not freaking chant riddles

3040.92 --> 3046.559
they don't help you with anything

3044.04 --> 3050.16
that delude you into believing that

3046.559 --> 3052.079
somebody dying relinquishes you of your

3050.16 --> 3055.6189999999997
freaking responsibility in your life

3052.079 --> 3055.619
it's disgusting

3077.7 --> 3082.5789999999997
now that shut everybody up

3079.98 --> 3082.579
good

3083.339 --> 3086.599
you think about that

3100.319 --> 3104.819
right okay well Matthew Mitchell when

3102.54 --> 3107.22
you say it like that I find no

3104.819 --> 3109.859
objections

3107.22 --> 3111.839
I'm just saying in my personal opinion I

3109.859 --> 3113.2799999999997
don't think he actually died and I don't

3111.839 --> 3115.14
think he needed to

3113.28 --> 3119.0400000000004
I mean if he had

3115.14 --> 3121.859
then why didn't he literally say that

3119.04 --> 3124.44
makes no sense there's a reason why he'd

3121.859 --> 3126.48
never literally said it but if you just

3124.44 --> 3128.88
say okay yeah he was killed because he

3126.48 --> 3130.98
was crushing too hard absolutely and

3128.88 --> 3133.319
that would be also the reason for an

3130.98 --> 3135.96
exit strategy

3133.319 --> 3138.42
he's doing it he was too good and if he

3135.96 --> 3141.9
would have stuck to it it would have

3138.42 --> 3143.4
been like bad war and his legacy would

3141.9 --> 3146.9
have probably been destroyed his words

3143.4 --> 3146.9
would have been erased

3146.94 --> 3151.02
right that's how I see it so I have no

3148.92 --> 3154.04
objection to uh what you just described

3151.02 --> 3154.04
there Matthew Mitchell

3158.28 --> 3163.2000000000003
no need to get out oh yeah there is need

3160.26 --> 3164.5200000000004
to get angry I'm angry for your

3163.2 --> 3168.7799999999997
foolishness

3164.52 --> 3172.44
and your willing foolishness at it you

3168.78 --> 3175.98
chant you're chanting yeah a chant is a

3172.44 --> 3177.359
curse it's a curse

3175.98 --> 3180.059
you understand

3177.359 --> 3181.38
it's a curse given to you and you took

3180.059 --> 3184.1400000000003
it

3181.38 --> 3187.819
and you believed it even though it makes

3184.14 --> 3187.819
no freaking sense whatsoever

3189.54 --> 3195.0
yeah and I bet that in the past

3192.319 --> 3197.7599999999998
disgusting situations have happened

3195.0 --> 3201.359
where people would literally be forced

3197.76 --> 3202.92
okay you say this chant right now and if

3201.359 --> 3205.14
you don't you're with the devil and

3202.92 --> 3207.54
we're gonna torture you to death yeah

3205.14 --> 3210.48
you think that's a good thing

3207.54 --> 3214.2
you think that's a [ __ ] good thing no

3210.48 --> 3216.44
it is the most despicable evil you can

3214.2 --> 3216.4399999999996
imagine

3225.0 --> 3229.619
yeah that's

3226.74 --> 3231.8999999999996
why some atheists are pissed off against

3229.619 --> 3233.819
Christians that's why that guy the other

3231.9 --> 3235.7400000000002
day came in like oh what about the

3233.819 --> 3239.88
freaking Crusades and then it's like

3235.74 --> 3244.9399999999996
yeah yeah exactly I know right yeah

3239.88 --> 3244.94
that's the problem is not Jesus though

3245.339 --> 3249.72
it's not Jesus

3247.5 --> 3252.26
Jesus would never condone that sort of

3249.72 --> 3252.2599999999998
stuff ever

3255.359 --> 3261.74
yeah okay you're getting another timeout

3258.119 --> 3261.7400000000002
do it again and you're out of here

3265.98 --> 3271.52
it's [ __ ] but you look up the body

3268.92 --> 3271.52
of science

3285.72 --> 3289.7
crazy Spanish inquisitors yes and they

3288.78 --> 3294.7200000000003
were

3289.7 --> 3297.72
theocrats they were theocrats theocracy

3294.72 --> 3301.3799999999997
claiming to have

3297.72 --> 3303.5989999999997
the connection with God and be allowed

3301.38 --> 3309.9
in the name of God to

3303.599 --> 3309.9
act atrociously evil murderous

3310.319 --> 3316.579
mind controlling

3312.359 --> 3316.5789999999997
that's theocracy it's evil

3316.74 --> 3324.5589999999997
it is evil

3319.74 --> 3324.5589999999997
it will always be evil

3330.079 --> 3335.36
because the only thing that drives it is

3333.48 --> 3338.7690000000002
power

3335.36 --> 3338.7690000000002
[Music]

3339.48 --> 3341.599
thank you

3349.5 --> 3353.46
oh Beauty

3351.24 --> 3355.74
you're calling them chance well yeah

3353.46 --> 3358.619
there have been some great things that

3355.74 --> 3361.319
have been said and great Inspirations I

3358.619 --> 3363.78
know Aries cursive man as I said not

3361.319 --> 3366.7799999999997
everybody in such religious

3363.78 --> 3369.299
organizations are evil they can't be

3366.78 --> 3370.8590000000004
because if it was only evil it will

3369.299 --> 3373.44
collapse there need to be people in

3370.859 --> 3376.0789999999997
there that genuinely believe it and that

3373.44 --> 3378.619
do good or it will all collapse

3376.079 --> 3378.619
right

3378.98 --> 3387.42
saying he died for our sins

3383.88 --> 3390.26
is not one of those things it's

3387.42 --> 3390.26
disgusting

3409.799 --> 3413.48
The Lord's Prayer

3413.64 --> 3421.98
if it contains that then yes it is evil

3418.619 --> 3424.799
it is evil if it contains he died for

3421.98 --> 3426.0
our sins it is evil or it's simply very

3424.799 --> 3429.119
wrong

3426.0 --> 3431.76
right you can tell because it shouldn't

3429.119 --> 3433.26
be too difficult to erase that part or

3431.76 --> 3437.7000000000003
replace it

3433.26 --> 3441.559
and if it is then still wrong and Evil

3437.7 --> 3441.5589999999997
then it has always been evil

3473.04 --> 3479.4
I mean do I need to get more clear

3475.7 --> 3480.1189999999997
or are you just trying to oh look we're

3479.4 --> 3483.78
gonna

3480.119 --> 3486.359
shove every part of this religious stuff

3483.78 --> 3489.3590000000004
in your face Arwin and then we're going

3486.359 --> 3492.5
to be all gasping oh he called it evil

3489.359 --> 3496.7
he called it evil how can he he must be

3492.5 --> 3502.319
a deceiver a deceiver

3496.7 --> 3505.859
or when the deceiver oh no

3502.319 --> 3508.5589999999997
Oh we must yeah yeah that means we close

3505.859 --> 3510.0
our doors right and we're gonna give him

3508.559 --> 3513.599
the evil eye

3510.0 --> 3516.54
because he might snap out of his evil

3513.599 --> 3520.26
you might relinquish it

3516.54 --> 3523.38
and go back to the chant again oh he

3520.26 --> 3525.98
died for sins oh

3523.38 --> 3525.98
no

3537.66 --> 3542.819
I'd sooner

3539.339 --> 3545.339
go back to the globe religion then

3542.819 --> 3547.68
relinquish this yeah you understand you

3545.339 --> 3550.44
understand fundies

3547.68 --> 3553.04
I'd rather go back to the globe

3550.44 --> 3553.04
yeah

3558.559 --> 3563.1800000000003
aries106 you know I was always that

3560.94 --> 3563.18
funny

3563.819 --> 3571.14
but it requires a little bit of passion

3567.66 --> 3574.2799999999997
and yeah a little bit of pain

3571.14 --> 3574.2799999999997
that brings that out

3585.42 --> 3590.04
forgive us our trespasses and we forgive

3588.059 --> 3591.96
those that trespass against yes well I

3590.04 --> 3594.0
have absolutely nothing against that PJ

3591.96 --> 3597.48
Cru shank I have nothing against that

3594.0 --> 3601.44
because that is actual Jesus teaching

3597.48 --> 3603.299
that is actually a mechanism that plays

3601.44 --> 3606.119
into his teaching

3603.299 --> 3608.28
I see nothing wrong with that

3606.119 --> 3610.319
right forgiveness

3608.28 --> 3613.38
forgive others

3610.319 --> 3615.72
as that will lead to them more easily

3613.38 --> 3620.04
forgiving you when you make a mistake

3615.72 --> 3622.2
it's the whole perspective thing like

3620.04 --> 3624.66
they're making a mistake forgive them

3622.2 --> 3626.52
they don't know what they're doing they

3624.66 --> 3629.3999999999996
might reconsider it somebody they might

3626.52 --> 3631.559
realize it was a mistake at some point

3629.4 --> 3634.2000000000003
do try to remind them but don't attack

3631.559 --> 3637.26
them be forgiving

3634.2 --> 3639.4199999999996
under condition that they mean well and

3637.26 --> 3642.0
that they're not making that mistake on

3639.42 --> 3644.579
purpose and blatantly keep doubling down

3642.0 --> 3648.42
in a very hostile manner because then

3644.579 --> 3650.96
it's different then it is unrepentant

3648.42 --> 3650.96
right

3652.76 --> 3655.849
[Music]

3656.88 --> 3662.28
okay you're out here scumbag get the

3659.64 --> 3664.2599999999998
[ __ ] out get out Peaceful Warrior I

3662.28 --> 3667.92
don't want you ever [ __ ] see you here

3664.26 --> 3670.7000000000003

3667.92 --> 3670.7000000000003
get out

3672.44 --> 3680.599
unrepentant Zealot Human Sacrifice

3676.88 --> 3680.599
worshiping scum

3680.76 --> 3682.94
foreign

3701.96 --> 3708.18
clutch that's right it all comes down to

3705.839 --> 3710.5789999999997
what Jesus himself said

3708.18 --> 3714.72
and he never even said he died how

3710.579 --> 3717.0
freaking dare you say that everything in

3714.72 --> 3718.5
the Bible the only point is that he

3717.0 --> 3721.02
freaking died

3718.5 --> 3724.099
for your ability to squirt without

3721.02 --> 3727.079
feeling guilt you scum

3724.099 --> 3730.8590000000004
gum weak

3727.079 --> 3730.8590000000004
scum disgusting

3739.96 --> 3743.199
[Music]

3760.559 --> 3765.2400000000002
I I'm very happy by the way for the

3763.2 --> 3767.339
people in my chat that do actually get

3765.24 --> 3770.339
it it's a great relief

3767.339 --> 3772.14
because to me this thing and I'm not the

3770.339 --> 3773.819
only one that has tried to tackle this I

3772.14 --> 3776.64
want Benjamin is trying to tackle it too

3773.819 --> 3779.2799999999997
in his own way and others but most keep

3776.64 --> 3783.14
in the background because it is so

3779.28 --> 3785.579
spread it is the biggest mind control

3783.14 --> 3788.2799999999997
curse plague

3785.579 --> 3791.4
in the western world that

3788.28 --> 3793.8590000000004
all Christianity all Christians just

3791.4 --> 3798.0
think that it's only about that

3793.859 --> 3800.5789999999997
it is the biggest satanic deception in

3798.0 --> 3803.76
human history in my opinion

3800.579 --> 3807.599
as I said before I cannot think of a

3803.76 --> 3811.5
single thing more satanic

3807.599 --> 3815.6400000000003
than Christians following and declaring

3811.5 --> 3818.819
somebody a God and they just arguable

3815.64 --> 3820.799
and then saying that he was sacrificed

3818.819 --> 3825.48
he died

3820.799 --> 3827.66
for your freedom it's so disgusting to

3825.48 --> 3827.66
me

3834.839 --> 3839.16
foreign

3836.16 --> 3843.319
fellow

3839.16 --> 3843.319
thanks for the 99 Super Chat donation

3843.539 --> 3847.619
why does this show get many downfall

3845.339 --> 3851.52
because of the fundies right either it's

3847.619 --> 3855.1800000000003
the anti-flat Earth fundies or it's the

3851.52 --> 3855.18
Christian fundies

3855.78 --> 3862.6800000000003
I make myself very popular

3859.26 --> 3865.079
that's sarcasm but maybe in the long run

3862.68 --> 3868.9199999999996
it will be a little I hope I hope that

3865.079 --> 3872.6400000000003
people can get over this obstacle this

3868.92 --> 3875.099
mental curse on man

3872.64 --> 3878.64
curse on those that think they're

3875.099 --> 3881.1600000000003
Christians it's a curse on them

3878.64 --> 3884.0989999999997
handed down by the priesthood to mind

3881.16 --> 3886.7
control all Christianity came out of

3884.099 --> 3886.7000000000003
theocracy

3891.799 --> 3895.88
anyway you may be back in two minutes

3974.819 --> 3977.0
thank you

4008.839 --> 4011.0789999999997
foreign

4016.4 --> 4023.2000000000003
thank you aries106 I really appreciate

4018.92 --> 4023.2000000000003
that I appreciate your you guys effort

4030.079 --> 4037.28
but yeah in reality the being in chat

4034.22 --> 4038.8999999999996
and the verbal support or having a

4037.28 --> 4042.4
supporting comment

4038.9 --> 4045.859
that actually proves that you understand

4042.4 --> 4048.2000000000003
what we're talking about I mean oh

4045.859 --> 4051.02
oh great work I wouldn't keep going I

4048.2 --> 4053.8999999999996
mean that's a supportive comment but it

4051.02 --> 4055.28
doesn't have any context

4053.9 --> 4057.6800000000003
right

4055.28 --> 4059.42
or if you say something about what was

4057.68 --> 4061.7599999999998
talked about and then you give your

4059.42 --> 4064.94
reflection your thoughts about that

4061.76 --> 4066.1400000000003
that's the best thumbs up I could ever

4064.94 --> 4069.079
have

4066.14 --> 4071.839
because it's all about Awakening it's

4069.079 --> 4073.52
all about did you get it do you get my

4071.839 --> 4074.42
point do you understand what's going on

4073.52 --> 4076.0389999999998
here

4074.42 --> 4079.039
that's

4076.039 --> 4084.079
that's what's really important to me

4079.039 --> 4086.8390000000004
more than any kind of stat register

4084.079 --> 4090.94
or a blank support statement without

4086.839 --> 4090.94
content just so you know

4093.21 --> 4096.4
[Music]

4103.159 --> 4107.239
you haven't been a very practicing

4105.5 --> 4108.739
Christian over the last few what did you

4107.239 --> 4111.3189999999995
what do you mean

4108.739 --> 4114.8589999999995
how do you reckon what have you engaged

4111.319 --> 4118.359
in that was lately not Christian

4114.859 --> 4118.359
guns have never on rmp

4119.179 --> 4123.38
I mean maybe you feel you haven't done

4121.279 --> 4125.779
enough

4123.38 --> 4128.12
but that's a sensation that even the

4125.779 --> 4130.88
best of Christians the ones that really

4128.12 --> 4135.4
do their best in the face of difficult

4130.88 --> 4135.400000000001
odds they will still feel that

4135.92 --> 4140.6
right often it'll always feel like it's

4138.38 --> 4142.58
never enough

4140.6 --> 4144.679
but if you're gonna state that you

4142.58 --> 4145.94
haven't been practicing it I'd like to

4144.679 --> 4149.4800000000005
know how

4145.94 --> 4152.5
what did you do that was unchristian

4149.48 --> 4152.5
according to you

4156.259 --> 4163.96
this

4158.06 --> 4163.96
Jason Howard Duck oh my God

4165.44 --> 4171.0199999999995
that's that movie is one hell of an

4167.96 --> 4173.9
oddity it's so ridiculous

4171.02 --> 4176.540000000001
but still interesting I thought

4173.9 --> 4178.759
like the mon the actor that plays the

4176.54 --> 4181.04
monster transition I thought that when I

4178.759 --> 4183.52
was a kid I was like super impressed by

4181.04 --> 4183.5199999999995
that [ __ ]

4183.799 --> 4187.58
it is like

4186.259 --> 4190.42
yeah

4187.58 --> 4190.42
cartoonish

4193.339 --> 4198.26
I've had I had fond memories of that

4195.86 --> 4200.5
movie but I know it's kind of a shitty

4198.26 --> 4200.5
movie

4201.26 --> 4208.4800000000005
weird

4203.54 --> 4208.48
I haven't seen it in like a decade

4209.48 --> 4213.86
it's not like oh I want to see that

4211.64 --> 4215.719
movie again no because it has really

4213.86 --> 4218.36
shitty Parts in it that are just lame

4215.719 --> 4221.9800000000005
and annoying and even a bit disgusting

4218.36 --> 4221.98
but whatever

4222.02 --> 4226.719
yeah that was random indeed

4233.12 --> 4237.76
I guess he successfully distracted me

4235.64 --> 4242.0
from the

4237.76 --> 4244.34
wielding the sharp sword moment

4242.0 --> 4248.08
and I was looking kind of for an excuse

4244.34 --> 4248.08
to step away because it is

4249.5 --> 4254.44
not a very pleasant thing to do

4256.219 --> 4260.96
but I'd have to do it

4258.98 --> 4263.12
I mean I'm a paladin

4260.96 --> 4265.88
and

4263.12 --> 4268.219
truth is everything if you figure

4265.88 --> 4270.26
something out you gotta fight for it or

4268.219 --> 4273.32
you lose it

4270.26 --> 4275.6
and with it I mean like everything all

4273.32 --> 4278.139999999999
of the Power of Truth

4275.6 --> 4278.14
God

4278.42 --> 4282.679
if you see something you gotta you gotta

4281.06 --> 4284.42
point it out you gotta fight for it you

4282.679 --> 4287.06
gotta realize how

4284.42 --> 4288.86
it is inside out in everybody else if

4287.06 --> 4292.3
that is actually the case and you can

4288.86 --> 4292.299999999999
prove it on the long run

4340.88 --> 4345.9800000000005
right

4343.52 --> 4347.719
that's right PG kershek you gotta call

4345.98 --> 4349.94
it or

4347.719 --> 4352.219
if you can't handle it like and that

4349.94 --> 4354.379999999999
that is a legitimate thing you know you

4352.219 --> 4355.82
can be confronted with something that

4354.38 --> 4359.4800000000005
you literally

4355.82 --> 4361.28
cannot find a proper place

4359.48 --> 4363.5
in yourself to deal with it you don't

4361.28 --> 4367.179
know what to think of it

4363.5 --> 4367.179
you can't put it in a place

4367.28 --> 4372.92
then forget about it because it's gonna

4370.159 --> 4374.839999999999
pop up again later and maybe then you

4372.92 --> 4376.54
will be ready to deal with it

4374.84 --> 4379.400000000001
right that's

4376.54 --> 4380.719
my life story concerning Flat Earth

4379.4 --> 4383.36
which

4380.719 --> 4385.699
I've been confronted with from a very

4383.36 --> 4388.46
young age on and it I would just forget

4385.699 --> 4391.58
as soon as I figured out the entire

4388.46 --> 4394.219
world is seemingly unofficially opposed

4391.58 --> 4396.08
to it that's when I literally lost the

4394.219 --> 4397.76
will to maintain it and just forgot

4396.08 --> 4399.5599999999995
about it just okay okay it's a globe

4397.76 --> 4401.54
fine

4399.56 --> 4405.14
I can work with that I can work with

4401.54 --> 4408.62
that a lot as you all know now

4405.14 --> 4411.62
so that's why the majority of my

4408.62 --> 4415.12
lifetime I have believed

4411.62 --> 4415.12
that the Earth was a globe

4417.5 --> 4421.94
even though I had been confronted with

4419.659 --> 4424.5199999999995
the Flat Earth and with the Mysteries

4421.94 --> 4426.5599999999995
and the issues with the globe I would

4424.52 --> 4428.42
just like not be able to handle it and

4426.56 --> 4430.280000000001
then I forgot about it again and moved

4428.42 --> 4432.08
on

4430.28 --> 4434.78
and then when somebody confronted with

4432.08 --> 4436.4
me again it's like oh you get reminded

4434.78 --> 4437.9
of all the previous time you got

4436.4 --> 4439.82
confronted with it again it's like it

4437.9 --> 4441.679
all comes back in the moment

4439.82 --> 4444.739
and then again it's like can I handle

4441.679 --> 4447.1990000000005
this now can I actually uphold this

4444.739 --> 4449.419999999999
no and then I dropped it again forgot

4447.199 --> 4451.879999999999
about it again moved on still believing

4449.42 --> 4454.2390000000005
the globe and that happened like four

4451.88 --> 4454.2390000000005
times

4457.34 --> 4466.34
until 2015 and that's

4461.42 --> 4470.4800000000005
when I knew now finally now like I don't

4466.34 --> 4472.58
want to have to face again

4470.48 --> 4474.139999999999
all the Echoes from my past being

4472.58 --> 4477.5599999999995
confronted with it

4474.14 --> 4480.9800000000005
because the more that happens the longer

4477.56 --> 4483.14
time is spent in between the more

4480.98 --> 4485.0599999999995
tiresome and shameful it becomes it

4483.14 --> 4487.400000000001
becomes shameful when you realize that

4485.06 --> 4489.02
you couldn't handle something like three

4487.4 --> 4491.599999999999
or four times

4489.02 --> 4494.120000000001
and that you forgot about it that's that

4491.6 --> 4498.14
feels shameful in the moment

4494.12 --> 4501.14
so then in 2015 it was like

4498.14 --> 4503.54
okay I'm not gonna forget this anymore I

4501.14 --> 4506.659000000001
refuse like I'm gonna hold this I'm

4503.54 --> 4511.06
Gonna Keep it and it's gonna hurt and it

4506.659 --> 4511.0599999999995
will never let go again never

4518.78 --> 4523.94
because I couldn't handle

4520.94 --> 4525.98
forgetting it again

4523.94 --> 4528.379999999999
like everything was already getting too

4525.98 --> 4530.839999999999
screwed up

4528.38 --> 4533.179
like even from within a non-flat earth

4530.84 --> 4535.52
perspective I already knew that NASA was

4533.179 --> 4538.12
full of [ __ ]

4535.52 --> 4541.820000000001
how I just saw it is like

4538.12 --> 4546.8
they're trying to discourage us

4541.82 --> 4550.099999999999
from actual sci-fi developments

4546.8 --> 4553.76
because they just want us dead or

4550.1 --> 4555.08
enslaved or dumb staring at a screen and

4553.76 --> 4556.820000000001
they don't actually want that

4555.08 --> 4559.58
development I still thought it was

4556.82 --> 4561.62
possible you see it's like no I know

4559.58 --> 4563.54
everything that they show us basically

4561.62 --> 4566.54
shows it's all [ __ ]

4563.54 --> 4569.179
but I think that they're there to make

4566.54 --> 4572.32
us disbelieve it it was very weird how

4569.179 --> 4572.32
your mind twists all that

4573.62 --> 4576.64
now I know better

4584.84 --> 4592.34
yes PG grushank yes it was

4587.679 --> 4595.88
2015 was when the gates were open

4592.34 --> 4599.179
when sadly the

4595.88 --> 4603.4400000000005
standard restrictions were

4599.179 --> 4606.64
lifted it was allowed to break out and

4603.44 --> 4606.639999999999
it was probably done

4609.739 --> 4616.639999999999
as a naturally unful they'd like tried

4614.239 --> 4618.98
to break a dam with us

4616.64 --> 4620.780000000001
like that does damage right when you

4618.98 --> 4623.9
break a dam it does damage suddenly

4620.78 --> 4627.5
everything gets flooded and [ __ ]

4623.9 --> 4630.82
that they try to use us like that

4627.5 --> 4632.38
they let wanted to let the Awakening

4630.82 --> 4635.9
destabilize

4632.38 --> 4638.900000000001
their project when the opponent was

4635.9 --> 4641.659
gonna get the Reigns

4638.9 --> 4644.36
yeah that's what I really think

4641.659 --> 4646.599999999999
it's just that oh guess what the one

4644.36 --> 4650.5
that actually allowed that to happen

4646.6 --> 4650.5
they're the main enemy

4650.659 --> 4656.54
yeah we are not on their side absolutely

4654.679 --> 4659.4800000000005
not

4656.54 --> 4661.94
the damn the water behind it coming

4659.48 --> 4665.599999999999
through it now because it's broken

4661.94 --> 4668.419999999999
we're not on their side on the ones that

4665.6 --> 4670.159000000001
basically green lighted it because they

4668.42 --> 4673.76
thought they could get some kind of a

4670.159 --> 4677.259999999999
political Advantage out of it

4673.76 --> 4677.26
and by now they all know

4684.26 --> 4689.179
right we're out of the box

4687.199 --> 4691.219
we ain't coming inside we're not going

4689.179 --> 4694.04
inside this box again

4691.219 --> 4696.9800000000005
right and if you literally go after us

4694.04 --> 4700.1
then we will become effectively whether

4696.98 --> 4705.218999999999
we realize or choose it or not become

4700.1 --> 4705.219
Martyrs and ingrain it even harder

4705.26 --> 4711.679
it will make the awareness even stronger

4708.5 --> 4714.5
that literally the people in control are

4711.679 --> 4717.14
pure about their mind control that it is

4714.5 --> 4719.06
only about mind control

4717.14 --> 4721.280000000001
and the bottom line

4719.06 --> 4723.8
that is what will be revealed if they

4721.28 --> 4726.5
truly truly

4723.8 --> 4728.0
even take our little isolated Corridor

4726.5 --> 4730.28
away right

4728.0 --> 4732.14
we've been designated to like the

4730.28 --> 4734.54
mountains like you go and live in the

4732.14 --> 4737.0
mountains you have a platform you just

4734.54 --> 4740.179
have to kind of do it away from the the

4737.0 --> 4743.239
main folk in the city in the valley just

4740.179 --> 4745.34
go in the mountains right that works

4743.239 --> 4747.32
because if anybody's curious they can go

4745.34 --> 4748.1
into the mountains people can say like

4747.32 --> 4751.46
well

4748.1 --> 4753.620000000001
you really want to get into all that so

4751.46 --> 4755.3
so complicated I wouldn't do it but yeah

4753.62 --> 4759.0199999999995
go to the mountains you know that's

4755.3 --> 4761.06
where the the Wizards are the weirdos

4759.02 --> 4762.92
that talk about that [ __ ]

4761.06 --> 4766.04
and then yeah

4762.92 --> 4767.78
it all flows naturally but if then the

4766.04 --> 4770.84
rulers whatever

4767.78 --> 4773.659
say oh no oh no now we're gonna hunt you

4770.84 --> 4775.6990000000005
down in those mountains if we are not

4773.659 --> 4777.62
going to tolerate that anymore because

4775.699 --> 4779.78
too many people have gone to the

4777.62 --> 4783.0199999999995
mountains

4779.78 --> 4785.659
and they are kind of disrupting our

4783.02 --> 4788.3
little schemes in the city

4785.659 --> 4790.28
well if they're gonna take yeah try to

4788.3 --> 4792.320000000001
get rid of us in the mountains then

4790.28 --> 4795.0199999999995
guess what everybody will know what

4792.32 --> 4798.34
happened everybody will know

4795.02 --> 4798.34
this leadership

4798.5 --> 4801.58
is evil

4802.28 --> 4807.699
there will be a scar on their soul

4804.14 --> 4807.6990000000005
that's not going to go away for a while

4809.36 --> 4812.08
what is that

4816.679 --> 4819.6990000000005
don't do that

4847.219 --> 4852.32
yeah Peter Christian no but at some

4850.219 --> 4855.56
point you can't go back in

4852.32 --> 4858.799999999999
because if you would it would be so

4855.56 --> 4860.96
forced you would the lack of actual

4858.8 --> 4863.4800000000005
spiritual Freedom would stand out so

4860.96 --> 4866.84
much to you you would literally become

4863.48 --> 4869.239
physically ill from it

4866.84 --> 4871.219
right because switching back the

4869.239 --> 4874.299999999999
forgetting process it kind of does make

4871.219 --> 4874.3
you physically ill

4875.84 --> 4879.139
you're literally twisting your own mind

4877.639 --> 4883.46
when you do it

4879.139 --> 4884.54
and if you're used to certain levels of

4883.46 --> 4887.12
freedom

4884.54 --> 4888.98
feel integrated with the knowledge to

4887.12 --> 4891.32
have certain levels of Freedom then to

4888.98 --> 4894.5599999999995
cut it all down all of a sudden and

4891.32 --> 4897.92
oversimplify yourself that is

4894.56 --> 4900.4400000000005
a terrible sensation it is so it's

4897.92 --> 4902.719
literally enslavement that's enslavement

4900.44 --> 4903.799999999999
is being conquered being enslaved losing

4902.719 --> 4906.679
your mind

4903.8 --> 4908.42
losing the freedom that you've grown to

4906.679 --> 4911.84
grasp

4908.42 --> 4913.52
that you become physically ill as a

4911.84 --> 4915.8
backlash from that

4913.52 --> 4917.540000000001
the more you have integrated with the

4915.8 --> 4920.659000000001
freedom and got used to it

4917.54 --> 4922.5199999999995
if it only was a temporary entertainment

4920.659 --> 4925.12
you thought about it and then put it

4922.52 --> 4928.280000000001
away again then you haven't fully

4925.12 --> 4930.08
developed into it and then it won't the

4928.28 --> 4932.42
strain won't be so terrible that you

4930.08 --> 4933.199
become physically ill from it maybe a

4932.42 --> 4936.5
little

4933.199 --> 4938.299999999999
if you like fully consciously awaken

4936.5 --> 4941.06
to these things

4938.3 --> 4944.3
and then try to force back into a box

4941.06 --> 4947.320000000001
you're going to become physically ill

4944.3 --> 4947.320000000001
guarantee it

4961.28 --> 4965.9
imagine trying to pretend being

4963.38 --> 4967.34
interested in the Deep black hole

4965.9 --> 4970.04
conversation without rolling your house

4967.34 --> 4973.3
I could do that

4970.04 --> 4973.3
it's so conceptual

4977.239 --> 4981.5199999999995
it's just mechanics just math to me

4982.28 --> 4987.98
math represented into a virtual reality

4985.1 --> 4991.06
is like I I can do that without rolling

4987.98 --> 4991.0599999999995
my own my eyes

4992.78 --> 4997.9
and I do it I do it on the Flat Earth

4994.699 --> 4997.9
debates regularly

5013.0 --> 5017.94
the cause of gravity no is not weight

5020.04 --> 5025.08
they think still Mass attracts Mass

5025.179 --> 5032.08
bending a space-time whatever

5029.199 --> 5035.32
gravity doesn't really have that concise

5032.08 --> 5037.6
a structure to follow

5035.32 --> 5041.32
because technically people don't really

5037.6 --> 5043.719
know what gravity is it's not officially

5041.32 --> 5047.159
defined

5043.719 --> 5047.159
Beyond conception

5047.5 --> 5051.639
right there's still people trying to

5049.659 --> 5054.42
find scientific evidence of gravity

5051.639 --> 5054.42
still now

5065.8 --> 5071.8
uh to distract from God since the shape

5069.46 --> 5074.32
of the earth will be no no it isn't then

5071.8 --> 5076.0
you don't understand God Ares cursor man

5074.32 --> 5078.219
if you say that

5076.0 --> 5080.38
Flat Earth to distract from God then you

5078.219 --> 5083.62
literally don't understand God because

5080.38 --> 5085.8
it's about the truth it's about figuring

5083.62 --> 5093.0599999999995
out the truth

5085.8 --> 5093.06
God is truth literally the essence

5094.36 --> 5099.699
how can figuring out the truth about

5097.48 --> 5101.799999999999
things and how people are fooled and

5099.699 --> 5104.678999999999
what they do how that works how can that

5101.8 --> 5107.679
be a distraction away from God when it

5104.679 --> 5110.1990000000005
teaches you exactly where God is and how

5107.679 --> 5112.96
people are and how this all works

5110.199 --> 5114.94
it brings you closer to God

5112.96 --> 5117.78
because you understand a little bit more

5114.94 --> 5117.78
because of it

5132.1 --> 5139.3
stop ascribing your views too quick what

5135.639 --> 5141.6990000000005
what do you what are you saying no

5139.3 --> 5145.4400000000005
I'm literally responding to what you

5141.699 --> 5145.44
said Aries curse event literally

5145.84 --> 5149.639
not ascribing views

5155.139 --> 5159.82
Flat Earth is all about hiding God

5157.84 --> 5162.400000000001
really how

5159.82 --> 5164.88
how is that clutch what what are you

5162.4 --> 5164.879999999999
talking about

5166.719 --> 5171.1
how

5168.28 --> 5174.219
how does Flat Earth hide God how

5171.1 --> 5177.46
explain it to mechanically how does it

5174.219 --> 5180.159
do that have you ever thought about it

5177.46 --> 5181.719
I mean yeah people Can chant oh Flat

5180.159 --> 5186.4
Earth is a distraction for what is

5181.719 --> 5189.159
hiding oh really how how is it doing

5186.4 --> 5192.28
that yeah I mean there's plenty of

5189.159 --> 5194.739
people that hate God that might be like

5192.28 --> 5197.86
yeah I [ __ ] hate all of that I want

5194.739 --> 5199.839999999999
to be free and to do whatever the [ __ ] I

5197.86 --> 5201.099999999999
feel like in the moment and be as Petty

5199.84 --> 5202.84
as I want

5201.1 --> 5205.4800000000005
and I'm going to remind people about

5202.84 --> 5208.96
that and talk about Flat Earth so how

5205.48 --> 5211.739
does that make flat Earth a distraction

5208.96 --> 5211.7390000000005
it doesn't

5217.84 --> 5223.4800000000005
sometimes you gotta actually

5221.02 --> 5224.9800000000005
have a follow-up to a statement you're

5223.48 --> 5226.659
gonna make

5224.98 --> 5228.339999999999
or you're going to end up sounding

5226.659 --> 5230.259999999999
really foolish

5228.34 --> 5233.26
because when you thought about what

5230.26 --> 5237.1
you're actually saying then it you can't

5233.26 --> 5241.26
actually even pin it down as to how

5237.1 --> 5241.26
that's the statement supposed to be true

5267.82 --> 5273.58
um excuse me Aries but

5271.42 --> 5276.159
maybe the entire point of discussing

5273.58 --> 5278.0199999999995
Flat Earth is to distract from God is

5276.159 --> 5279.4
what you said

5278.02 --> 5282.84
yeah

5279.4 --> 5282.839999999999
that's not an open question

5283.42 --> 5290.679
that's what do you call again let's say

5287.679 --> 5294.36
rhetorical question

5290.679 --> 5294.36
it's basically saying yeah

5295.8 --> 5301.659000000001
so yeah you are literally saying that

5299.32 --> 5303.219
you're being very weird and twisty right

5301.659 --> 5306.94
now with the words

5303.219 --> 5308.8
what are are you going to retract that

5306.94 --> 5312.82
statement you made that's fine if you

5308.8 --> 5312.820000000001
want to if you want to retract

5312.94 --> 5318.299999999999
it doesn't matter if you said maybe you

5315.58 --> 5318.3
suggested it

5321.699 --> 5327.879999999999
don't don't go politician on on me in my

5325.12 --> 5330.179
chat Aries Christmas I do not appreciate

5327.88 --> 5330.179
that

5345.34 --> 5351.82
okay well Aries curse of man maybe I

5349.239 --> 5353.138999999999
will just ignore what you say then from

5351.82 --> 5355.96
now on

5353.139 --> 5358.96
because apparently

5355.96 --> 5361.12
it doesn't mean what it says right

5358.96 --> 5362.199
you're being a little politician [ __ ]

5361.12 --> 5364.48
right now

5362.199 --> 5366.5199999999995
it's really disgusting it's not the

5364.48 --> 5369.28
first thing you did in my chat that I

5366.52 --> 5372.52
find repulsive

5369.28 --> 5374.92
and if you keep this up I will end up

5372.52 --> 5376.540000000001
Banning you because you are getting

5374.92 --> 5380.56
really annoying

5376.54 --> 5384.6

5387.699 --> 5393.638999999999
ridiculous things maybe this yeah

5391.84 --> 5396.1
but if I

5393.639 --> 5399.1

5396.1 --> 5400.06
sarcastically which I can because I'm on

5399.1 --> 5402.54
camera

5400.06 --> 5402.54
right

5403.12 --> 5407.86

5405.58 --> 5410.139
ridiculous example right well that

5407.86 --> 5412.659
didn't come across when you said it in

5410.139 --> 5414.900000000001
chat yeah just because you put maybe in

5412.659 --> 5414.9

5459.719 --> 5467.8
Jesus's existence or relevance

5601.719 --> 5609.28
the way you said it is so disgraceful

5606.58 --> 5613.0599999999995
because it has nothing to do with that

5609.28 --> 5616.179
Jesus has nothing to do with that you

5613.06 --> 5618.34
are a racist and a [ __ ] right now

5616.179 --> 5620.679
you're pathetic

5618.34 --> 5626.26
for somebody with your intelligence

5620.679 --> 5627.76
capacity that is disgusting Petty

5626.26 --> 5629.8
it's not something I'm gonna respect

5627.76 --> 5631.06
from you ever

5629.8 --> 5634.4800000000005
stupid

5631.06 --> 5638.52
you're literally degrading everything

5638.52 --> 5643.659000000001
racist comment

5640.9 --> 5645.28
look at you Rasta look at what you've

5732.58 --> 5737.199
if in Jesus well I don't give a [ __ ]

5734.86 --> 5739.659
about who believes in Jesus really

5737.199 --> 5741.638999999999
because to me it doesn't even have any

5739.659 --> 5743.32
involvement with belief it's just the

5741.639 --> 5746.86
teachings it's just the things he

5743.32 --> 5749.38
revealed patterns systems

5746.86 --> 5752.259999999999
that's the thing I believe in

5749.38 --> 5755.9800000000005
I don't really care beyond that and

5752.26 --> 5758.400000000001

5784.26 --> 5789.639
Petty Earthly squabbling

5792.34 --> 5795.42

5830.86 --> 5834.159
written in the story actually physically

5832.84 --> 5836.1990000000005
existed

5834.159 --> 5838.36
and I don't care

5836.199 --> 5841.0

5855.82 --> 5860.98
any of that anything

5858.58 --> 5862.42
only the spirit

5860.98 --> 5865.0599999999995
that's

5862.42 --> 5867.88
power of Jesus is spirit it's the wisdom

5865.06 --> 5870.6990000000005
it's the messages and the perfect

5867.88 --> 5874.36
consistency the fractal nature right

5870.699 --> 5876.699
that's the value that's the thing

5874.36 --> 5879.42
not any freaking color not even the way

foreign

5928.719 --> 5932.52
no I'm not going there

5936.88 --> 5942.639
let those that curse themselves to hell

5940.42 --> 5944.9800000000005
deal with hell

5942.639 --> 5947.4400000000005
the Earthly

5944.98 --> 5949.178999999999
stupid time-wasting [ __ ] that doesn't

5947.44 --> 5951.04
help you ascend

5949.179 --> 5954.1
let them

5951.04 --> 5958.0
wrestle in the dirt

5954.1 --> 5959.92
I'm not going to wrestle with you in the

5958.0 --> 5961.96
dirt do you get it

5959.92 --> 5963.9400000000005
you want to wrestle in the dirt you go

5961.96 --> 5966.699
ahead

5963.94 --> 5968.86
I'm gonna listen to the patterns I'm

5966.699 --> 5971.0199999999995
gonna figure it out I'm gonna do what

5968.86 --> 5973.599999999999
Jesus said what happened

5971.02 --> 5975.780000000001
people would have sent him I'm doing my

5973.6 --> 5975.780000000001
best

5992.82 --> 5997.199
shrouded Turin come on

5997.659 --> 6000.659
foreign

6007.46 --> 6011.06
for that Jason

6012.36 --> 6016.4
now that is blasphemy

6016.56 --> 6023.400000000001
even though it was a joke it's not funny

6020.219 --> 6026.96
I'm not amused by this I'm not amused by

6023.4 --> 6026.96
all this Petty squabbling

6033.44 --> 6037.46
no run Mandan

6049.619 --> 6055.619
yeah snowboards yeah that's pretty much

6051.78 --> 6057.9
it well summarized well done

6055.619 --> 6060.239
with the bunk Mass attracting Mass with

6057.9 --> 6063.119
gas behavior and Black Swan or mass

6060.239 --> 6066.239
attracting Mass Newtonian mechanics on

6063.119 --> 6068.5199999999995
which it's based that part it excludes

6066.239 --> 6070.08
gas behavior right and the Black Swan

6068.52 --> 6073.4400000000005
shows that

6070.08 --> 6075.719
it's not turned into a globe

6073.44 --> 6077.94
which is kind of what the idea suggests

6075.719 --> 6079.139
it's part of that philosophy

6077.94 --> 6081.419999999999
right

6079.139 --> 6083.28
in space-time you can't very manipulate

6081.42 --> 6085.32
a concept so it's not science that's

6083.28 --> 6088.759999999999
correct well said

6085.32 --> 6088.759999999999
in one sentence well done

6089.6 --> 6092.799
[Music]

6100.739 --> 6104.879999999999
Jesus is not in the dirt he ascended to

6103.199 --> 6109.5
heaven

6104.88 --> 6111.179
on his own authority hmm okay okay I

6109.5 --> 6115.52
have no objection with that statement

6111.179 --> 6115.52
good servant I have no objection at all

6142.98 --> 6146.419999999999
we don't need gravity

6148.739 --> 6151.759999999999
that's right

6176.42 --> 6182.9400000000005
plants use gravity to grow

6179.719 --> 6185.46
no they don't nothing uses gravity

6182.94 --> 6188.219
doesn't exist it's a concept

6185.46 --> 6189.54
yeah relative density this equilibrium

6188.219 --> 6192.54
oh yeah

6189.54 --> 6195.3
all mechanics all life utilize relative

6192.54 --> 6199.219
density this equilibrium right the

6195.3 --> 6199.219
naturally pushing forces

6200.1 --> 6205.08
that's right

6202.619 --> 6206.94
plants definitely use that

6205.08 --> 6210.5
it's not gravity though

6206.94 --> 6210.5
run Mandan

6213.679 --> 6217.76
graphy Trope is what

6221.4 --> 6224.48
the [ __ ]

6229.8 --> 6232.88
like what

6240.6 --> 6245.1
they actually named it graphitropism oh

6243.9 --> 6248.0
my God

6245.1 --> 6248.0
whoa

6248.52 --> 6250.6990000000005
foreign

6251.4 --> 6254.78
of course they did

6264.179 --> 6272.219
I don't need to test it run Man Dan I've

6268.32 --> 6276.84
done it I've studied that the thing is

6272.219 --> 6279.6
gravity doesn't exist it's not gravity

6276.84 --> 6281.159000000001
it isn't it's just relative density this

6279.6 --> 6284.88
equilibrium

6281.159 --> 6287.46
right the plants the matter of the plan

6284.88 --> 6289.5
even as it grows being more dense than

6287.46 --> 6293.219
the gas that surrounds it

6289.5 --> 6295.739
it's gonna exert a pressure downwards

6293.219 --> 6298.26
due to the disequilibrium with its

6295.739 --> 6299.759999999999
environment and that's how it figures

6298.26 --> 6303.0
out okay

6299.76 --> 6307.1990000000005
it organizes the growth pattern

6303.0 --> 6309.84
to stack the downward pressure to find a

6307.199 --> 6312.36
vertical so that the pressure all gets

6309.84 --> 6315.4800000000005
lined up in a singular line that's

6312.36 --> 6318.139
what's happening it's not gravity

6315.48 --> 6318.138999999999
understand

6319.32 --> 6325.199
it's relative density this equilibrium

6322.32 --> 6328.28
based organizing

6325.199 --> 6328.28
the growth pattern

6334.679 --> 6340.58
it's to do with what

6337.679 --> 6340.58
to do it yet

6343.26 --> 6350.1
what the hell is that no that's that

6345.86 --> 6352.44
biochemistry that's how it does that

6350.1 --> 6355.38
is

6352.44 --> 6359.879999999999
is no gravity its relative density this

6355.38 --> 6361.7390000000005
equilibrium yeah there is that Force

6359.88 --> 6364.1990000000005
it's not gravity

6361.739 --> 6366.959999999999
you understand it's not gravity it's not

6364.199 --> 6370.4
gravity it's not gravity it's relative

6366.96 --> 6370.4
density it is equilibrium

6371.1 --> 6374.9400000000005
how do the growth hormones end up at the

6373.98 --> 6379.218999999999
bottom

6374.94 --> 6379.219
well probably because they're more dense

6379.619 --> 6386.0
than the average plant sap

6382.56 --> 6386.0
if I'd had to guess

6388.139 --> 6394.7390000000005
I don't know because it's designed that

6390.6 --> 6397.8
way dude I am not like literally a life

6394.739 --> 6400.08
designer I don't know everything that

6397.8 --> 6402.360000000001
comes with that it's so bloody

6400.08 --> 6406.46
complicated

6402.36 --> 6406.46
okay but I know enough

6407.639 --> 6413.82
they are a dancer well then I don't know

6409.98 --> 6416.218999999999
but what I do know is gravity doesn't

6413.82 --> 6419.219
exist

6416.219 --> 6422.4
it doesn't exist it doesn't exist so

6419.219 --> 6425.88
whatever is going to be attributed

6422.4 --> 6428.099999999999
If gravity is in there is wrong

6425.88 --> 6431.159000000001
it isn't gravity

6428.1 --> 6432.780000000001
gravity is just a catch-all phrase

6431.159 --> 6435.719
for the relative density this

6432.78 --> 6438.3
equilibrium forces

6435.719 --> 6442.58
that are consistent and persistent

6438.3 --> 6442.58
within the functioning of this realm

6448.739 --> 6454.5599999999995
yeah dude [ __ ] get the [ __ ] out of here

6452.28 --> 6458.88
you [ __ ]

6454.56 --> 6461.159000000001
[ __ ] off ball [ __ ] you're a [ __ ]

6458.88 --> 6464.52
ball [ __ ]

6461.159 --> 6466.138999999999
y doesn't exist I don't give a [ __ ] what

6464.52 --> 6468.900000000001
you think

6466.139 --> 6472.26
proves it it doesn't exist that's not

6468.9 --> 6475.32
there everything attributed to gravity

6472.26 --> 6478.619000000001
actually can be explained through

6475.32 --> 6481.199
scientific empirical method yeah

6478.619 --> 6484.08
relative density it's called relative

6481.199 --> 6487.0199999999995
density and it's not nonsensical driven

6484.08 --> 6491.6
it's scientific fact unlike your stupid

6487.02 --> 6491.6
little gravity myth you balltart idiot

6493.61 --> 6496.8099999999995
[Music]

6499.11 --> 6504.96
[Music]

6502.98 --> 6506.94
it is a force

6504.96 --> 6508.5
Bobby steals

6506.94 --> 6510.96
you want to get out you want to get

6508.5 --> 6513.179
kicked out of here

6510.96 --> 6515.1
if you're too stupid to make sense of

6513.179 --> 6517.8
things that you've been listening to for

6515.1 --> 6522.56
years now maybe you should close your

6517.8 --> 6522.56
gap before you get yourself banned

6525.719 --> 6530.699
what causes air pockets in the earth

6528.54 --> 6533.54
what

6530.699 --> 6533.54
what do you mean

6534.659 --> 6540.42
you mean gas caves and all that what

6537.9 --> 6542.699
causes that uh

6540.42 --> 6546.17
container wall right gas is going to

6542.699 --> 6547.259999999999
expand in all directions if it is closed

6546.17 --> 6550.88
[Music]

6547.26 --> 6550.88
it's completely closed off

6552.3 --> 6556.1990000000005
right now unless water is gonna leak in

6555.0 --> 6560.28
a cave

6556.199 --> 6562.0199999999995
and like sit there fill it up then the

6560.28 --> 6565.0199999999995
gas pressure that might not be able to

6562.02 --> 6566.9400000000005
escape is going to get more pressurized

6565.02 --> 6569.219
until it will

6566.94 --> 6572.28
well if water is going to seep down that

6569.219 --> 6574.199
also means that gases could seep back up

6572.28 --> 6576.98
so I don't even get the point here why

6574.199 --> 6576.98
did you bring that up

6581.219 --> 6586.94
since when did relative density this

6583.44 --> 6586.94
equilibrium become a Force

6587.94 --> 6592.08
it always was a force

6590.4 --> 6595.259999999999
what the hell are you blubbering about

6592.08 --> 6598.5
Bad Karma dude I have Hangouts

6595.26 --> 6603.0
specifically dedicated to that subject

6598.5 --> 6605.639
like 10 of them years ago

6603.0 --> 6608.659
it's scientific fact you hear me

6605.639 --> 6611.900000000001
scientific fact

6608.659 --> 6614.219
absolute scientific undeniable

6611.9 --> 6618.379999999999
repeatable fact

6614.219 --> 6618.38
it's the most complete model

6618.599 --> 6624.06
of what's of what was formally thought

6621.54 --> 6627.84
of as gravity that has been made

6624.06 --> 6629.9400000000005
relative density relative density and

6627.84 --> 6632.88
this equilibrium between objective

6629.94 --> 6635.098999999999
medium is what causes the force and due

6632.88 --> 6637.9800000000005
to that Force displacement until it

6635.099 --> 6640.1990000000005
finds an equilibrium with the density of

6637.98 --> 6642.178999999999
the medium it is in if ever and if it

6640.199 --> 6644.4
can't if it is obstructed physically

6642.179 --> 6647.04
cannot move

6644.4 --> 6650.339999999999
then that this equilibrium force will

6647.04 --> 6653.58
translate into local pressure in that

6650.34 --> 6655.4400000000005
direction of the disequilibrium

6653.58 --> 6658.139
that's how it works

6655.44 --> 6659.94
because in all the code goes in both

6658.139 --> 6662.159000000001
directions right a helium balloon will

6659.94 --> 6664.739
do exactly the same in the opposite

6662.159 --> 6667.86
direction as a solid object because a

6664.739 --> 6669.299999999999
helium balloon its average density is

6667.86 --> 6672.239
less

6669.3 --> 6674.58
than at than gas pressure at ground

6672.239 --> 6676.98
level so it's going to move up this

6674.58 --> 6678.78
equilibrium is going to be up and if it

6676.98 --> 6681.659
is barred from moving if it's stuck

6678.78 --> 6684.179
against the ceiling then it will push up

6681.659 --> 6686.04
instead it will cause that pressure to

6684.179 --> 6688.92
be up yeah

6686.04 --> 6691.44
relative density this equilibrium it is

6688.92 --> 6695.82
a complete model and when I say complete

6691.44 --> 6698.04
I mean complete no exceptions it's so

6695.82 --> 6700.44
complete

6698.04 --> 6702.239
people could ever get that for it could

6700.44 --> 6705.0599999999995
literally be declared a natural law

6702.239 --> 6707.598999999999
because it is complete and there is no

6705.06 --> 6707.599
exceptions

6708.659 --> 6713.339999999999
but I don't need it to be a natural to

6710.82 --> 6714.48
just call it scientific fact is much

6713.34 --> 6716.34
more fun

6714.48 --> 6719.339999999999
so much more fun

6716.34 --> 6721.32
and True by the way it's not a joke it

6719.34 --> 6723.42
is true it is scientific fact and it's

6721.32 --> 6726.599
much more fun to say that

6723.42 --> 6729.3
because ballers they were decided to be

6726.599 --> 6731.58
proof they want to prove yeah you don't

6729.3 --> 6733.8
have any we do

6731.58 --> 6737.58
relative density

6733.8 --> 6742.46
scientific fact yeah I know like to rub

6737.58 --> 6742.46
that in your faces I like doing that

6743.34 --> 6748.38
you think Einstein might disagree really

6750.42 --> 6753.1990000000005
it

6760.139 --> 6764.9400000000005
that's right good servant well pressure

6762.119 --> 6766.139
is weight weight is calculated in

6764.94 --> 6769.138999999999
pressure

6766.139 --> 6771.3
it's literally pressure translated to a

6769.139 --> 6773.400000000001
numerical value that's what weight is

6771.3 --> 6776.54
that's how it is established so you're

6773.4 --> 6776.54
correct well said

6779.219 --> 6782.82
run Mandan is Simon I wouldn't be

6781.739 --> 6786.839999999999
surprised

6782.82 --> 6788.759999999999
or he's just a Simon dad disciple it

6786.84 --> 6790.139
doesn't really matter

6788.76 --> 6791.76
like

6790.139 --> 6797.099
dude

6791.76 --> 6800.52
Simon Dan is so weak so weak

6797.099 --> 6803.58
like his soccer counts if he actually

6800.52 --> 6808.280000000001
uses them are less of a nuisance than

6803.58 --> 6808.28
most because he's so weak

6809.4 --> 6814.799999999999
like weak spirited like Simon Dan's

6812.46 --> 6818.58
spirit is so weak it is like almost

6814.8 --> 6822.0
phenomenal compared to most

6818.58 --> 6824.82
so he's such little threat that even if

6822.0 --> 6828.48
he went undercover he would barely stand

6824.82 --> 6830.759999999999
out because he is so weak

6828.48 --> 6833.459999999999
it's just not a threat

6830.76 --> 6835.679
how is Dan weak he's weak spirited he's

6833.46 --> 6838.5
weak-minded

6835.679 --> 6842.179
he doesn't have passion he doesn't even

6838.5 --> 6842.179
have passion to Double Down

6842.34 --> 6850.139
on just convictions that much it does

6847.26 --> 6852.179
it's weak weakness I'm sorry I'm not

6850.139 --> 6854.88
gonna give you any more description I

6852.179 --> 6857.54
just sense weakness with Simon then more

6854.88 --> 6857.54
than with most

6857.58 --> 6863.219
is one of the weakest

6860.42 --> 6864.119
unspirited anti-flatter authors out

6863.219 --> 6865.619
there

6864.119 --> 6867.9
vacant it's

6865.619 --> 6872.82
nothing going on

6867.9 --> 6872.82
no Spirit no idea weak

6876.179 --> 6883.099
uh oh really run marathons requires a

6879.719 --> 6883.099
strong mind oh really

6885.179 --> 6890.04
okay

6887.04 --> 6892.94
well you should have told that to uh

6890.04 --> 6892.94
what's his name again

6898.44 --> 6905.119
dude it's just wrong I can't believe you

6901.02 --> 6905.119000000001
said something that's stupid oh

6918.3 --> 6924.3
his account is quite strong

6921.0 --> 6927.3
you mean paid for beefed up

6924.3 --> 6930.659000000001
heavily promoted because that's what

6927.3 --> 6931.7390000000005
evil people want they want retards to be

6930.659 --> 6934.32
popular

6931.739 --> 6937.5
so that everybody latches on to that

6934.32 --> 6939.659
goes with that level and then stays a

6937.5 --> 6943.28
[ __ ] yeah I know

6939.659 --> 6943.28
I know that's how it works

6944.06 --> 6947.159000000001
[Music]

6954.179 --> 6961.82
oh 500k Subs yeah 500k Subs yet no point

6959.3 --> 6965.58
and he is

6961.82 --> 6967.739
Infamous for his dumb statements like

6965.58 --> 6970.5
you and your reference frames are ruined

6967.739 --> 6973.08
which still stands to this day as the

6970.5 --> 6975.119
dumbest thing an anti-flat earther has

6973.08 --> 6978.0199999999995
ever said

6975.119 --> 6978.0199999999995
you get that

6978.119 --> 6984.598999999999
that's the dumbest thing on record a

6981.9 --> 6987.179
anti-flat earther has ever said

6984.599 --> 6989.82
and I know

6987.179 --> 6993.42
everybody all the guys they agree with

6989.82 --> 6995.34
me I know because it's true

6993.42 --> 6997.7390000000005
what I'm saying here is not arbitrary

6995.34 --> 7001.52
it's not me just oh let's take a jab of

6997.739 --> 7004.5199999999995
Simon that no it's like let's let's put

7001.52 --> 7008.780000000001
it down exactly what it is right there

7004.52 --> 7012.9800000000005
he's weak very weak-minded weak-spirited

7008.78 --> 7015.32
he barely even has passion

7012.98 --> 7017.0599999999995
and I don't give a [ __ ] how big his

7015.32 --> 7020.799999999999
freaking account is

7017.06 --> 7020.8
it literally doesn't matter

7023.36 --> 7029.0199999999995
he's weak

7026.06 --> 7029.02
feeble-minded

7034.82 --> 7038.44
at Best You've disproved right no no but

7037.28 --> 7044.0599999999995
Debo

7038.44 --> 7047.36
74. that's no no you're very incorrect

7044.06 --> 7049.76
no fed live today steamy Traveler

7047.36 --> 7051.92
nope

7049.76 --> 7055.04
I think

7051.92 --> 7057.4400000000005
yeah that's right nope

7055.04 --> 7058.88
no but because at Best You've disproved

7057.44 --> 7062.54
the radius

7058.88 --> 7066.32
is actually half the statement

7062.54 --> 7069.139
it's freaking hilarious right

7066.32 --> 7074.179
it's hilarious I agree

7069.139 --> 7077.4800000000005
but it is basically saying okay well

7074.179 --> 7079.34
you've disproved the exact radius right

7077.48 --> 7081.619
so it's kind of a nitpicky statement

7079.34 --> 7083.78
it's very arrogant it's like oh you have

7081.619 --> 7085.219
disproved the exact rate is oh it might

7083.78 --> 7087.259999999999
be slightly different what's the point

7085.219 --> 7091.0
right that's basically what it's saying

7087.26 --> 7095.06
it's not halfway as dumb as to say

7091.0 --> 7096.92
you not us you and your reference frames

7095.06 --> 7098.4800000000005
which the flat earthers don't have

7096.92 --> 7099.8
because they know the Earth is

7098.48 --> 7101.54
stationary

7099.8 --> 7104.139
are ruined

7101.54 --> 7104.139
no

7105.98 --> 7111.879999999999
no absolutely Simon Dan is

7108.92 --> 7115.04
is holder of the dumbest

7111.88 --> 7118.400000000001
anti-flatter statement to date and that

7115.04 --> 7120.199
it can't be topped not really

7118.4 --> 7122.48
because it was natural it's not

7120.199 --> 7124.879999999999
something he actually thought he was

7122.48 --> 7126.98
smart saying that you see that's the

7124.88 --> 7128.4800000000005
difference anybody can act like an

7126.98 --> 7131.299999999999
anti-flat earth or say something stupid

7128.48 --> 7134.598999999999
dude I do that all the time on the FED

7131.3 --> 7136.46
because it's funny I just act like an

7134.599 --> 7139.58
anti-flat earth and then I say something

7136.46 --> 7143.78
stupid to that level but it's different

7139.58 --> 7145.4
because Simon then actually thoughts he

7143.78 --> 7149.0
was smart

7145.4 --> 7152.259999999999
he actually believed it right you can't

7149.0 --> 7152.26
top that you can't

7173.56 --> 7178.639
marathon race again no dude I don't give

7177.08 --> 7181.099
a [ __ ]

7178.639 --> 7183.86
how long he can run

7181.099 --> 7184.88
that's really cute I have no Ambitions

7183.86 --> 7189.32
for that

7184.88 --> 7191.179
besides I much modified natural Sprinter

7189.32 --> 7194.08
I'm not so much about Marathon running

7191.179 --> 7194.08
never liked it

7198.139 --> 7204.04
I just don't like it

7199.82 --> 7204.04
I mean I could do it at some point

7204.679 --> 7212.119
and it does require some training but

7208.659 --> 7215.48
why would I give a [ __ ] to to trust my

7212.119 --> 7218.0
to check my physical condition and

7215.48 --> 7221.239
compare it to Simon then what the only

7218.0 --> 7222.86
reason to do that is to kind of make him

7221.239 --> 7226.82
feel a little better about himself

7222.86 --> 7229.098999999999
because he is probably good at it right

7226.82 --> 7232.58
that doesn't make him an intellectual

7229.099 --> 7235.159000000001
competent person though

7232.58 --> 7237.099
because that statement earlier to say oh

7235.159 --> 7241.759999999999
it requires

7237.099 --> 7244.04
intellect how did he say it requires

7241.76 --> 7246.4400000000005
skill and smart what was it I'm

7244.04 --> 7248.54
paraphrasing right now to be a marathon

7246.44 --> 7251.799999999999
runner that is the one of the dumbest

7248.54 --> 7251.8
things I've heard anybody say

7251.9 --> 7258.5599999999995
maybe that was set by Simon then

7255.86 --> 7262.699
because it is too that stupidity level

7258.56 --> 7266.139
to actually say it and believe it

7262.699 --> 7266.138999999999
and not say it as a joke

7273.139 --> 7278.2390000000005
to admit Dan is actually stronger

7275.96 --> 7281.659
well in Marathon running probably

7278.239 --> 7283.879999999999
because I don't train it you know I'm

7281.659 --> 7285.92
pretty good on the bike though and I

7283.88 --> 7292.9400000000005
mean really good

7285.92 --> 7295.58
I I bicycle I like my bicycle bicycle

7292.94 --> 7298.339999999999
it's really cheap and Rusty but I'm very

7295.58 --> 7303.699
good at it and you know what

7298.34 --> 7303.6990000000005
I go out bicycling without hands

7304.04 --> 7308.3
like to keep my balance to train my back

7306.619 --> 7311.239
and my balance

7308.3 --> 7314.599
very very good at it

7311.239 --> 7318.739
like really really good at it because

7314.599 --> 7321.32
I've been training it for half my life

7318.739 --> 7324.08
but I'm not like oh I'm gonna go on my

7321.32 --> 7327.4
bicycle and go for like a bicycling tour

7324.08 --> 7327.4
for two hours or anything

7327.8 --> 7332.02
I'm much more of a natural Sprinter

7332.3 --> 7337.52
explosive power

7334.58 --> 7339.76
and balance those are physical skills I

7337.52 --> 7339.76
have

7347.42 --> 7351.86
ah

7350.239 --> 7354.638999999999
yeah

7351.86 --> 7354.639
yeah I do

7363.139 --> 7372.28
I think my IQ is at least double

7367.4 --> 7372.28
Simon Dan's numerical IQ value

7373.34 --> 7380.179
uh IQ is a big word it's probably

7377.119 --> 7384.08
just overall working definitely EQ I

7380.179 --> 7387.4
think my EQ is about 50 times better

7384.08 --> 7387.4
than that of Simon then

7388.34 --> 7393.38
I mean I we must be good at calculating

7391.04 --> 7394.46
[ __ ] right I'm not good at calculating

7393.38 --> 7396.86
[ __ ]

7394.46 --> 7400.34
I'm good at understanding [ __ ] though

7396.86 --> 7401.9
right oh you calculate something yeah

7400.34 --> 7404.84
you know

7401.9 --> 7407.239
you could also just understand what it

7404.84 --> 7409.58
is why you calculated what it's doing

7407.239 --> 7412.159
what the

7409.58 --> 7414.98
the overall in all directions

7412.159 --> 7417.679
possibilities are if you get it then you

7414.98 --> 7420.5
don't necessarily need to calculate it

7417.679 --> 7423.92
right you just understand what is going

7420.5 --> 7427.28
on that's how I got through math

7423.92 --> 7430.52
successfully in school

7427.28 --> 7432.8
by understanding it and pattern

7430.52 --> 7436.52
recognition

7432.8 --> 7440.079000000001
you don't need to be good at calculus

7436.52 --> 7440.079000000001
to understand things

7447.5 --> 7453.139
and spend 50 Min yeah yeah that's a time

7450.199 --> 7455.36
to end that so you can get the [ __ ] out

7453.139 --> 7457.659000000001
of here all of you stupid Simon then

7455.36 --> 7461.299999999999
suck [ __ ]

7457.659 --> 7463.5199999999995
disgusting gamma scumbags

7461.3 --> 7466.099
get the [ __ ] out I'm not wasting any

7463.52 --> 7469.84
more time on that absolute [ __ ]

7466.099 --> 7469.84
you're right time to go

7480.02 --> 7486.92
to triggering no he's a [ __ ] [ __ ]

7482.78 --> 7489.639
and he's boring he's boring as [ __ ] only

7486.92 --> 7493.04
thing not boring about him is how

7489.639 --> 7497.679
unbelievably obliviously [ __ ] he is

7493.04 --> 7497.679
to people that are not absolute morons

7497.96 --> 7502.82
yeah

7500.06 --> 7505.639
that's the only thing that actually can

7502.82 --> 7511.579
get something to happen in response to

7505.639 --> 7511.579
because he's so [ __ ] boring

7511.76 --> 7514.179
right

7517.94 --> 7522.379999999999
you don't get all this hate towards

7519.8 --> 7524.360000000001
Simon then I'm not hating him I'm just

7522.38 --> 7527.119
thinking he's absolutely lame and it

7524.36 --> 7528.799999999999
will be very merciless about my judgment

7527.119 --> 7531.5599999999995
about him

7528.8 --> 7535.28
be very merciless because he is an

7531.56 --> 7537.619000000001
anti-flat earther scumbag lying

7535.28 --> 7540.5
sniveling coward

7537.619 --> 7541.759999999999
this worst quality is his absolute

7540.5 --> 7543.32
cowardice

7541.76 --> 7546.02
he is

7543.32 --> 7548.599
not just one of the dumbest anti-flat

7546.02 --> 7553.0
earthers he's always also the most

7548.599 --> 7553.0
cowardice anti-flat earther

7553.699 --> 7556.48
pathetic

7565.119 --> 7571.04
stop talking about Dan and go to

7567.92 --> 7572.78
exeteras well I've kind of rounded out

7571.04 --> 7576.94
that whole thing

7572.78 --> 7576.94
and I'm gonna round out the show as well

7577.579 --> 7582.32
because this is just going to be trolls

7579.679 --> 7584.42
squirting over this now and

7582.32 --> 7587.179
I don't really want to go back to the

7584.42 --> 7590.599
the Christian issue I put down some

7587.179 --> 7593.4400000000005
really strong points and made some

7590.599 --> 7593.4400000000005
yeah very

7594.679 --> 7599.9
how do you say that

7597.199 --> 7602.299999999999
very adamant statements

7599.9 --> 7605.54
that I've continued

7602.3 --> 7607.28
for like at least an hour or a half an

7605.54 --> 7610.28
hour I don't remember how long it was

7607.28 --> 7612.8
very intense I don't need to go back I

7610.28 --> 7616.119
might go back another time but I am

7612.8 --> 7616.119000000001
gonna round out the show now

7620.9 --> 7627.138999999999
if you can gouge the sarcasm check your

7623.599 --> 7630.26
IQ ah ah Depot 74 you're slightly

7627.139 --> 7633.32
incorrect that's actually EQ

7630.26 --> 7636.860000000001
IQ doesn't help you understand sarcasm

7633.32 --> 7640.659
isn't that isn't that ironic but it's

7636.86 --> 7640.659
okay it's an easy mistake to make

7642.02 --> 7647.179
no IQ doesn't help you understand

7644.84 --> 7650.96
sarcasm

7647.179 --> 7654.619
it's e q that does that you have to feel

7650.96 --> 7657.92
it you have to feel the intent

7654.619 --> 7660.199
mechanical quickness doesn't help you

7657.92 --> 7661.639
spot sarcasm it doesn't help you spot

7660.199 --> 7663.739
intention

7661.639 --> 7667.04
you see intention

7663.739 --> 7669.919999999999
is a social quality it's another field

7667.04 --> 7674.139
it's not intellectual it's social and it

7669.92 --> 7674.139
requires an EQ to spot that

7674.84 --> 7679.52
what people damn it I'm on your side I

7677.179 --> 7682.099
know I'm just I'm just correcting you

7679.52 --> 7684.679
slightly I'm I get it it's not I'm not

7682.099 --> 7687.56
like oh how dare you no it's just it's a

7684.679 --> 7690.1990000000005
minor mistake I just it it stood out to

7687.56 --> 7692.599
me and I wanted to explain that's all

7690.199 --> 7694.839999999999
I know you're on my side whatever that

7692.599 --> 7694.84
means

7708.739 --> 7712.579
all right all right all right all right

7710.9 --> 7715.339999999999
so oh

7712.579 --> 7716.84
look at the downvotes oh that is Simon

7715.34 --> 7719.179
then for sure

7716.84 --> 7722.56
that is him I know it is but that's fine

7719.179 --> 7722.56
we'll give it a [ __ ]

7722.719 --> 7728.619
he is literally no threat no amount of

7725.48 --> 7732.0199999999995
numerical values on his side

7728.619 --> 7733.759999999999
subscribers money anything it doesn't

7732.02 --> 7738.820000000001
matter because he is one of the most

7733.76 --> 7742.639
vacant dumb individuals ever seen

7738.82 --> 7744.5
universally and that's including actual

7742.639 --> 7747.38
clinical retards

7744.5 --> 7750.199
and people that are like born

7747.38 --> 7752.4800000000005
intellectually malformed those people

7750.199 --> 7757.598999999999
that are born intellectually malformed

7752.48 --> 7760.459999999999
on average are smarter than simandan

7757.599 --> 7762.02
downvoting is gay indeed it is

7760.46 --> 7764.96

7811.76 --> 7814.4800000000005
sorry about that

7815.0 --> 7819.76
right I will be back tomorrow Flat Earth

7836.179 --> 7840.38
think and you want to say something

7837.619 --> 7842.36
about it leave a comment

7840.38 --> 7846.32
in the comment section

7842.36 --> 7849.139
right there was a lot said today

7846.32 --> 7850.34
I would appreciate more feedback

7849.139 --> 7852.8
right

7850.34 --> 7857.7390000000005
silence doesn't help I need more

7852.8 --> 7857.7390000000005
feedback need opinions or objections

7858.02 --> 7863.360000000001
but it's got to be sensible if I've

7860.3 --> 7866.2390000000005
addressed it and you're just repeating

7863.36 --> 7868.46
that that's no help to anybody

7866.239 --> 7869.78
but I would appreciate some in detail

7868.46 --> 7872.0
comments

7869.78 --> 7875.119
right so

7872.0 --> 7878.38
yeah until the next video
