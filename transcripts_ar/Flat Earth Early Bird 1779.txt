around you don't seem to be complaining

367.28 --> 370.15999999999997
about it at

370.24 --> 374.08
least right so yeah whatever was

372.68 --> 378.40000000000003
glitching so

374.08 --> 378.4
heavily I think it was going around

379.72 --> 386.44000000000005
generally and it might have

382.919 --> 389.79999999999995
stopped if you two guys are not having

386.44 --> 392.16
the issue anymore I I really hope that

389.8 --> 395.08
steamy traveler doesn't have it

392.16 --> 398.03900000000004
either but it does seem that well

395.08 --> 401.479
Richard G like blatantly availed it by

398.039 --> 401.479
taking his dad's YouTube

407.039 --> 411.4
account hey drar good to see

418.4 --> 422.31899999999996

422.319 --> 426.40000000000003
either yesterday when I was trying to

423.879 --> 426.40000000000003
watch own

426.759 --> 435.36
Benjamin so whatever was going on out

431.08 --> 435.35999999999996
there it seems to have stopped

440.08 --> 447.24
again did I lose your wrench yeah most

443.759 --> 447.24
people lost their wrenches Dr

448.319 --> 455.24
utar

450.96 --> 455.23999999999995
yeah and I'm kind of keeping it that way

455.44 --> 459.759
because there's no

457.52 --> 462.44
more weird

459.759 --> 466.759
moderating [ __ ] happening that

462.44 --> 466.759

466.84 --> 469.84
people

478.319 --> 482.36
secretly

479.96 --> 485.63899999999995
let me just check the list to see if

482.36 --> 485.639
it's still like

508.24 --> 511.24
that

521.2 --> 526.36
it's quite surprising how many actual

523.44 --> 526.36
trolls are out

529.959 --> 533.68
there it's not just

538.2 --> 542.839
socks right but everything seems just

544.519 --> 547.519
fine

552.64 --> 562.08

592.32 --> 597.279
other YouTube accounts as well

594.64 --> 600.76
teret like other YouTube accounts like

597.279 --> 603.24

600.76 --> 603.24
still

606.76 --> 615.16
stalls

609.44 --> 619.0400000000001
what thieves stole the ATM out

h

631.64 --> 635.48
two more tried with ye

651.519 --> 657.32
what that's interesting clutch tracking

655.399 --> 659.92
device on yeah that would be actually

657.32 --> 663.9200000000001
kind of a good idea

659.92 --> 663.92
like to have it inside the device

687.959 --> 691.4399999999999
too

689.84 --> 694.6
[Music]

691.44 --> 694.6
L montic

697.6 --> 701.399

704.6 --> 710.72
right yeah slowmo well in the past here

708.04 --> 713.04
you're in ut too there's been like gangs

710.72 --> 713.0400000000001
that

713.279 --> 717.959
like oh they actually use explosive to

716.36 --> 720.5600000000001
blow them

717.959 --> 723.92
up it's really [ __ ]

720.56 --> 726.92
up but I haven't seen that around in

723.92 --> 726.92
like

728.639 --> 735.04
years like when I just moved here that

731.36 --> 737.6
happened like after a year was really

735.04 --> 740.16
freaky cuz it's like not too far away I

737.6 --> 740.16
heard the

743.72 --> 747.8000000000001
explosion it's really freaking

747.88 --> 750.88
loud

753.839 --> 756.519
but uh

762.39 --> 767.27
[Music]

774.24 --> 779.72
yeah yeah nothing like that's happening

776.56 --> 782.079
out here today at least

779.72 --> 786.0400000000001
these days

782.079 --> 788.4799999999999
they're working on the streets on

786.04 --> 792.0
something I think it still has to do

788.48 --> 795.88
with the the new internet

792.0 --> 795.88
lines they're installing

801.6 --> 807.76
everywhere I'm really curious as to like

804.24 --> 811.0790000000001
what they're expecting to even

807.76 --> 812.4399999999999
like I mean it's if this new internet's

811.079 --> 814.2399999999999
just going to be there that's going to

812.44 --> 817.12
be fantastic like we are going to have

814.24 --> 820.24
like probably among the fastest internet

817.12 --> 822.199
in the world I'm not even joking it's

820.24 --> 824.9590000000001
just

822.199 --> 826.8
that the way our government is doing

824.959 --> 830.079
things now like are we even going to be

826.8 --> 830.079
able to use it by the

830.72 --> 836.6800000000001
time or is it or they going to put it

834.48 --> 839.0790000000001
there just for their internet to

836.68 --> 842.04
infrastructure or something I don't no

839.079 --> 842.04
man I really hope

847.56 --> 852.7589999999999
not but I am really glad about it

850.16 --> 859.56
because I've been recommend recommending

852.759 --> 862.88
it for decades like yeah we need

859.56 --> 865.5999999999999
like uh glass fiber

862.88 --> 867.48
cables like everywhere throughout the

865.6 --> 872.16
Netherlands I've been recommending that

867.48 --> 872.16
straight to politician even back in the

875.56 --> 882.959
day like we need that like whatever is

879.24 --> 882.9590000000001
going to happen that's always a good

885.44 --> 891.6
thing what kind of internet speed do you

888.44 --> 891.6
got now

895.399 --> 904.6
uh how the hell do you even measure that

900.0 --> 904.6
hey Dan good to see you man how you

906.399 --> 912.839
doing one gigabyte

909.839 --> 912.839
fiber

913.759 --> 918.92
okay well look when I download like even

917.32 --> 921.639
pirate base stuff and all that it

918.92 --> 925.88
downloads like typically at 5 megabytes

921.639 --> 925.88
per second which is pretty damn

927.6 --> 930.6
fast

932.04 --> 937.12
it might be able to go

934.68 --> 939.92
faster it's usually whenever I'm

937.12 --> 942.079
downloading anything it's limited in its

939.92 --> 944.279
speed because of where I'm downloading

942.079 --> 944.279
it

948.16 --> 952.399
from is slow yeah sure it

953.72 --> 958.3190000000001
is it's not there yet I mean they're

956.199 --> 961.079
still literally putting the cables in

958.319 --> 963.8389999999999
the ground right

961.079 --> 966.5999999999999
now five is slow I still think that's

963.839 --> 969.8000000000001
really damn fast

966.6 --> 972.48
actually I mean it's slow if you insist

969.8 --> 973.56
on downloading all your movies at 4K and

972.48 --> 977.24
all that

973.56 --> 979.56
nonsense sure then it's slow but I don't

977.24 --> 979.5600000000001
do

987.519 --> 990.519
that

999.72 --> 1004.9590000000001
what the [ __ ] yeah okay monx patch

1002.12 --> 1009.199
thanks the thing is I don't use an air

1004.959 --> 1009.199
fryer I don't have an air fryer I never

1013.24 --> 1020.48
will also I've never broken my

1017.48 --> 1020.48
foot

1022.399 --> 1028.439
and i' like done Taekwondo and

1025.16 --> 1031.559
everything so

1028.439 --> 1035.1200000000001
no my boots are still nosed and

1031.559 --> 1035.12
everything like this not going to

1036.439 --> 1039.439
happen

1041.439 --> 1047.16
uh unfortunately I did break a plate

1044.439 --> 1050.799
yesterday though which really sucked

1047.16 --> 1050.799
because those things are super

1052.28 --> 1058.559
old and that just really sucks it's like

1055.16 --> 1062.28
that's stuff that my mother

1058.559 --> 1066.76
bought when we were little kid so but I

1062.28 --> 1066.76
got more thank God I got a lot of

1067.72 --> 1072.48
it it's first thing of ceramic that I've

1071.24 --> 1075.48
broken

1072.48 --> 1080.64
in at least a

1075.48 --> 1080.64
decade so that's good enough for an

1081.039 --> 1088.32
average but uh yeah I don't break things

1086.0 --> 1090.28
normally just yes and I get really

1088.32 --> 1092.1589999999999
pissed off when I do because I never

1090.28 --> 1094.559
break

1092.159 --> 1097.1200000000001
anything yesterday was kind of a weird

1094.559 --> 1097.12
clumsy

1107.32 --> 1110.32
day

1119.48 --> 1124.3600000000001
890 megabytes per second that's insane

1122.72 --> 1129.1200000000001
Dr uder that's

1124.36 --> 1129.12
like that's just a network connection

1131.6 --> 1136.84
then it's like that's not even in that's

1134.52 --> 1139.76
just a network connection what the

1136.84 --> 1143.0
hell right anyway I don't know how how

1139.76 --> 1146.4
fast that is that speed supposedly how

1143.0 --> 1146.4
the hell do you even check such

1157.4 --> 1164.0
things I'm such a noob I don't even know

1160.36 --> 1164.0
how to freaking check my internet

1167.24 --> 1170.24
speed

1177.2 --> 1182.76
Dr O is a woman I don't know what the

1179.36 --> 1182.76
[ __ ] is he or

1197.24 --> 1201.509
she

1198.45 --> 1201.509
[Music]

1202.38 --> 1205.439
[Applause]

1227.159 --> 1230.159
okay

1241.76 --> 1247.72
oh yeah it's more than 5 megabytes a

1243.84 --> 1249.52
second it seems like the average is

1247.72 --> 1253.48
around

1249.52 --> 1257.12
3540 megabytes per second yeah

1253.48 --> 1260.1200000000001
said that's what they say

1257.12 --> 1260.12
40

1267.6 --> 1273.1999999999998
and

1268.679 --> 1276.52
24.6 upload speed right so that's that's

1273.2 --> 1276.52
my internet speed I

1287.039 --> 1290.039
guess

1302.799 --> 1306.76
what the hell are thought guys talking

1304.44 --> 1306.76
about

1308.32 --> 1316.1589999999999
teret right anyway so you got the speed

1311.84 --> 1319.24
40 megabytes per second download and 24

1316.159 --> 1321.88
upload woohoo it's not super staggering

1319.24 --> 1325.76
but I mean i' I don't have issues with

1321.88 --> 1328.919
downloading I'm not like it's too

1325.76 --> 1330.679
slow I have to wait 5 minutes to

1328.919 --> 1333.919
download a

1330.679 --> 1336.24
movie the [ __ ] you dude it's perfect

1333.919 --> 1339.7990000000002

commercial I'm not switching

1502.039 --> 1505.039
whoa

1507.799 --> 1513.0
weird I wish I had an Illuminati cassan

1510.96 --> 1514.96
but I

1513.0 --> 1517.28
don't I'm going to have to wait till

1514.96 --> 1520.359
launch after

1517.28 --> 1520.359
[Music]

1526.679 --> 1531.48
this

1528.6 --> 1535.48
so I'm going to ask again anybody out

1531.48 --> 1535.48
here I could really use some

1535.799 --> 1542.48
support well for Illuminati cant and for

1539.559 --> 1542.48
dinner proper

1553.2 --> 1560.919
dinner CU yeah most of the sport that I

1556.399 --> 1562.9599999999998
got in a week ago it's spent it's well

1560.919 --> 1565.3600000000001
spent by the way I'm really happy with

1562.96 --> 1568.52
what I got the food that I had was

1565.36 --> 1571.7199999999998
delicious and very nutritional very

1568.52 --> 1573.399
healthy for me like I really noticed the

1571.72 --> 1575.24
difference like between like a french

1573.399 --> 1579.399
fries

1575.24 --> 1582.2
evening and when I like actually have

1579.399 --> 1584.2399999999998
meat and like butter and all that it's a

1582.2 --> 1586.8400000000001
big

1584.24 --> 1588.6
difference talking about butter I'm like

1586.84 --> 1590.9599999999998
almost clean without of

1588.6 --> 1594.039
butter and I'm almost clean out of

1590.96 --> 1596.52
vitamin C like I have vitamin C for one

1594.039 --> 1598.52
more day and then I'm through it and I

1596.52 --> 1602.2
can't afford a new one even though

1598.52 --> 1602.2
they're in the discount right

1602.84 --> 1608.08
now I can get a second bottle for half

1606.159 --> 1610.44
the price which is a great deal it's the

1608.08 --> 1613.24
same deal I got the previous time saves

1610.44 --> 1614.64
me like a lot but I don't have the money

1613.24 --> 1619.6
right

1614.64 --> 1619.6000000000001
now so I really need the support

1628.32 --> 1633.279
and I hope to

1633.44 --> 1641.159
yeah you and guys want or

1638.159 --> 1641.159
insist

1642.399 --> 1649.52
what no Dr utar not k fult

1658.679 --> 1663.3990000000001
yeah I don't need cheap options I don't

1661.08 --> 1667.519
need to know some tips on how to get the

1663.399 --> 1667.5189999999998
cheapest [ __ ] [ __ ]

1676.519 --> 1681.32
thanks but I do need a bit of

1682.72 --> 1688.919
support basically for food I mean I'll

1685.24 --> 1690.72
just let the the vitamin C just let it

1688.919 --> 1693.7990000000002
go I guess because I don't think

1690.72 --> 1695.96
somebody's going to like drop me a big

1693.799 --> 1698.519
PayPal like that so that I could afford

1695.96 --> 1701.2
that so I'm just going to like oh I'll

1698.519 --> 1702.96
just not take it anymore for a while and

1701.2 --> 1704.64
let's see if I survive it's going to

1702.96 --> 1708.039
really get bad well you're just going to

1704.64 --> 1710.7990000000002
see me all sick here then and maybe then

1708.039 --> 1712.24
somebody's going to [ __ ] support me

1710.799 --> 1713.84
now it's probably not going to happen

1712.24 --> 1716.84
that way

1713.84 --> 1718.72
but yeah food has priority I've already

1716.84 --> 1720.6
like I quit

1718.72 --> 1724.32
the

1720.6 --> 1726.36
uh damn it what was it called

1724.32 --> 1729.1589999999999
again ashua

1726.36 --> 1734.08
Ganda it was interesting but I quit it

1729.159 --> 1734.0800000000002
like uh what is it now two months

1735.12 --> 1743.6399999999999
ago and I yeah yeah I don't I think I

1739.76 --> 1746.36
did need it but I don't need it anymore

1743.64 --> 1750.0800000000002
so it was very helpful probably while

1746.36 --> 1751.76
quitting alcohol and all that but it's

1750.08 --> 1753.76
like I quit it and it's like I don't

1751.76 --> 1755.519
even really miss it so that's great I

1753.76 --> 1761.24
just don't need that anymore it saves me

1755.519 --> 1761.24
some cost vitamin C however that's a bit

1766.32 --> 1772.12
different

1769.08 --> 1774.559
so I'd really hope to get a bit of

1772.12 --> 1774.559
support

1777.519 --> 1782.0
in thought somebody was going to support

1780.0 --> 1785.2
me yesterday they were asking like hey

1782.0 --> 1787.0
how can I support you but I never got

1785.2 --> 1790.48
they never got back to

1787.0 --> 1790.48
me I'm a bit

1796.32 --> 1799.32
disappointed

1801.519 --> 1805.279
hey Jason mccormac good to see

1809.12 --> 1815.76
you is the Illuminati kasan

1812.48 --> 1815.76
nutritional yeah

1816.519 --> 1820.919
decently it's at least it's not like

1821.88 --> 1827.48
negative but I admit like the Illuminati

1824.64 --> 1829.679
cons is not the most cost efficient type

1827.48 --> 1831.3990000000001
of thing it's fun though and it's very

1829.679 --> 1833.8400000000001
convenient during the

1831.399 --> 1835.84
show so hey some people like the

1833.84 --> 1838.24
Illuminati cound other people write

1835.84 --> 1841.48
comments like how disgusting is it is

1838.24 --> 1843.76
people really like you

1841.48 --> 1845.919
watching I mean at this point I just

1843.76 --> 1848.32
have to laugh I have to do it with that

1845.919 --> 1852.0
voice and just laugh about it like these

1848.32 --> 1854.24
people whining like hey you always go

1852.0 --> 1856.399
around to channels that do things that

1854.24 --> 1859.76
you really don't like and then just

1856.399 --> 1863.5189999999998
complain about it it wow that's your

1859.76 --> 1863.519
life is it

1864.2 --> 1869.679
unbelievable but uh yeah no for me the

1867.88 --> 1872.7990000000002
priorities are really kind of set on

1869.679 --> 1874.8400000000001
just like things like dinner and butter

1872.799 --> 1877.08
especially butter I mean it's pretty

1874.84 --> 1880.84
tough to like get baked eggs and

1877.08 --> 1880.84
everything if I don't have butter you

1881.44 --> 1886.159
know and it's an essential component for

1884.24 --> 1889.159
my dinners

1886.159 --> 1889.159
so

1900.559 --> 1904.96
what the [ __ ] why are you guys talking

1902.24 --> 1904.96
about freaking

1906.679 --> 1910.039
sports [ __ ]

1916.159 --> 1919.159
sake

1928.679 --> 1934.799
all right anyway yeah uh Omen Benjamin

1932.12 --> 1937.2399999999998
had a really interesting show yesterday

1934.799 --> 1939.639
about like more studies of narcissists

1937.24 --> 1939.639
and all

1941.039 --> 1945.6
that it was kind of puzzling like there

1943.48 --> 1949.6390000000001
are some traits that just make me think

1945.6 --> 1952.399
like wait is that me but then there's

1949.639 --> 1955.36
other traits that I'm like oh that's

1952.399 --> 1955.36
definitely not

1960.039 --> 1967.519
me like they not really having feelings

1964.08 --> 1969.799
part like no I definitely actually have

1967.519 --> 1969.799
those

1975.24 --> 1980.3990000000001
feelings but yeah it was interesting and

1978.36 --> 1985.399
it's very relevant still I mean there's

1980.399 --> 1985.399
a lot of it out there hey Mato

1987.279 --> 1994.48
hello so anybody watched Owen Benjamin

1990.639 --> 1994.4799999999998
yesterday and not freaking

1994.84 --> 1999.9189999999999
sports I'm going to start timing people

1997.88 --> 2003.75
out if you don't [ __ ] stop talking

1999.919 --> 2005.96
about damn sports that I don't watch

2003.75 --> 2008.799
[Music]

2005.96 --> 2012.159
Ever it's bad enough that terret brings

2008.799 --> 2012.1589999999999
up freaking Cricket every

2014.37 --> 2017.4199999999998
[Music]

2020.919 --> 2024.6000000000001
time can I have your

2026.039 --> 2031.8799999999999
attention

2028.2 --> 2035.3600000000001
yeah so Flat Earth debates will be on

2031.88 --> 2037.24
later in about 35 minutes from now just

2035.36 --> 2039.559
so you know Nathan's got got his

2037.24 --> 2043.84
computer back from the shop and

2039.559 --> 2043.84
everything and seems to be

2053.399 --> 2058.919
working oh yeah another news flash Alex

2056.32 --> 2061.04
Jones is like in a bad spot too

2058.919 --> 2062.0
financially and he walked out on his own

2061.04 --> 2064.44
show

2062.0 --> 2068.359
yesterday when he specifically spent

2064.44 --> 2071.32
like 5 minutes to ask the callers not to

2068.359 --> 2074.72
not to ask him about how he's doing or

2071.32 --> 2077.079
to quit the show he spent 5 minutes

2074.72 --> 2079.919
asking like don't bring that up or I'm

2077.079 --> 2082.48
going to be gone the first caller like

2079.919 --> 2085.6389999999997
immediately said oh please I don't want

2082.48 --> 2088.2
you to go like [ __ ]

2085.639 --> 2090.28
[ __ ] I mean these callers are [ __ ]

2088.2 --> 2091.6389999999997
retards some of them and some of them

2090.28 --> 2095.28
are really

2091.639 --> 2098.96
good it's like but yeah so was just

2095.28 --> 2104.7200000000003
basically half the show was just clip

2098.96 --> 2108.7200000000003
show old pieces because yeah he's

2104.72 --> 2111.2799999999997
pretty messed up like Alex Jones is not

2108.72 --> 2113.72
doing great it's like he's getting

2111.28 --> 2115.1600000000003
financially into the abyss it's getting

2113.72 --> 2117.52
really bad for

2115.16 --> 2121.68
him and it's

2117.52 --> 2125.88
like [ __ ] idiotic liberal [ __ ] court

2121.68 --> 2129.0
system that's just doing fake fake law

2125.88 --> 2131.119
but they're just doing that and nobody's

2129.0 --> 2133.359
like it's completely insane that's like

2131.119 --> 2136.44
Imperial nonsense

2133.359 --> 2140.88
Behavior but they're like oh yeah

2136.44 --> 2143.52
just more Millions like like a court can

2140.88 --> 2146.4
just say like oh you're you have to pay

2143.52 --> 2147.72
more Millions like no but they're doing

2146.4 --> 2150.1600000000003
that

2147.72 --> 2152.68
though it's pretty messed up I mean that

2150.16 --> 2155.7999999999997
entire court system

2152.68 --> 2157.64
should like be

2155.8 --> 2159.48
deposed

2157.64 --> 2162.48
just kick him

2159.48 --> 2162.48
out

2162.599 --> 2168.6800000000003
completely it's abominable that that's

2165.68 --> 2174.2799999999997
even possible

2168.68 --> 2178.5389999999998
like Corruptions like that is so bad I

2174.28 --> 2178.539
[Music]

2179.079 --> 2185.7200000000003
mean it's a miracle a coup hasn't

2181.839 --> 2187.44
happened it's actually a miracle in my

2185.72 --> 2190.0789999999997
opinion

2187.44 --> 2190.079
a bad

2193.52 --> 2197.64
miracle if if there's such a

2198.24 --> 2203.3999999999996
thing right so that's happening out

2201.119 --> 2204.96
there nobody gives a [ __ ] over here of

2203.4 --> 2208.319
course because you all just want to talk

2204.96 --> 2211.4
about [ __ ] Sports all the time in my

2208.319 --> 2213.24
[ __ ] chat of my live stream like like

2211.4 --> 2214.599
that's what this show is for talking

2213.24 --> 2219.0
about

2214.599 --> 2219.0
sports the [ __ ] is wrong with you you

2224.85 --> 2228.0899999999997
[Music]

2241.72 --> 2248.64
man okay let me put it another

2244.68 --> 2251.2799999999997
way 20 bucks before tomorrow

2248.64 --> 2254.52
1:00 or no

2251.28 --> 2256.92
show yeah and no talking about sports

2254.52 --> 2260.4
then in the chat because that seems to

2256.92 --> 2264.669
be what you want to be doing with this

2260.4 --> 2264.669
[Music]

2267.02 --> 2270.099
[Music]

2275.599 --> 2286.4300000000003
time

2277.74 --> 2286.43
[Music]

2289.599 --> 2296.28
why you think Dr Shiva would be one of

2293.16 --> 2299.2
us I I don't exactly understand what

2296.28 --> 2302.0
that means though exactly would be one

2299.2 --> 2305.359
of us like what a flat

2302.0 --> 2307.88
earther an open flat earther with flat

2305.359 --> 2311.2799999999997
Earth arguments a flat Earth de beter to

2307.88 --> 2312.92
be more specific I mean the guy's

2311.28 --> 2315.28
definitely not going to be like a disc

2312.92 --> 2318.2400000000002
earther nonsense

2315.28 --> 2319.96
person maybe he is maybe he does know

2318.24 --> 2322.2799999999997
about Flat Earth debates it would be

2319.96 --> 2322.28
pretty

2323.16 --> 2327.98
awesome and he's definitely smart enough

2326.319 --> 2331.159
for it

2327.98 --> 2331.159
[Music]

2333.48 --> 2339.359
absolutely oh he's stred with Santos

2337.64 --> 2341.64
wow that guy really gets everywhere

2339.359 --> 2341.64
doesn't

2348.839 --> 2354.7599999999998
he right yeah and with Owen Benjamin

2352.16 --> 2357.48
don't forget that home Benjamin talks

2354.76 --> 2357.48
about Flat Earth

2360.599 --> 2367.7200000000003
plenny but yeah you could could be I

2364.8 --> 2371.319
mean he doesn't seem to be like a flat

2367.72 --> 2374.319
earther media wise but he's he doesn't

2371.319 --> 2377.8
give a [ __ ] about Globe nonsense and

2374.319 --> 2380.079
outer space though although he might

2377.8 --> 2382.5600000000004
sometimes use it as an analogy in

2380.079 --> 2385.7200000000003
explaining

2382.56 --> 2388.04
something he doesn't actually care about

2385.72 --> 2391.1189999999997
space because he probably just knows it

2388.04 --> 2391.119
that that it is all

2395.4 --> 2398.4
nonsense

2404.2 --> 2413.3199999999997
all right so yeah

2405.8 --> 2413.32
[Music]

2421.64 --> 2427.52
cool globe with stress on the be what

2425.4 --> 2431.2000000000003

2661.68 --> 2667.2799999999997
cuz I actually challenge you and when

2665.359 --> 2669.92

2667.28 --> 2671.0400000000004
things that will probably happen to you

2669.92 --> 2673.44

2671.04 --> 2675.96
probably make you uncomfortable might

2673.44 --> 2679.559
even create some chaos in your life yeah

2675.96 --> 2682.559
but one thing following me never ever

2679.559 --> 2684.2000000000003
does is make you

2682.559 --> 2688.119
dumber

2684.2 --> 2691.319
yeah because if that would be the result

2688.119 --> 2694.0
I would freaking kill myself because I

2691.319 --> 2696.96
hate dumb I hate everything that is dumb

2694.0 --> 2700.079
I hate dumbness in the world I hate the

2696.96 --> 2702.52
stupidity of people and I've been kind

2700.079 --> 2706.48
of obsessed my entire life

2702.52 --> 2711.28
on basically curing

2706.48 --> 2714.2
idiocy yeah it's my personal like very

2711.28 --> 2717.28
private personal inner mission is to

2714.2 --> 2721.24
universally cure

2717.28 --> 2724.88
stupidity I've worked very hard at

2721.24 --> 2727.8799999999997
it considering the

2724.88 --> 2727.88
circumstances

2728.44 --> 2731.68
people don't become stupider when they

2730.72 --> 2734.0789999999997
follow

2731.68 --> 2735.7599999999998
me they might get stressed out they

2734.079 --> 2737.88
might get Rowdy they might get

2735.76 --> 2740.4
insecurities that they get confronted

2737.88 --> 2744.04
with with within them whatever but

2740.4 --> 2745.88
Dumber definitely not

2744.04 --> 2748.8
so right

2745.88 --> 2752.1600000000003
so was it noteworthy or was it just a

2748.8 --> 2754.88
really shitty negative rant was he just

2752.16 --> 2756.48
like just spilling

2754.88 --> 2761.92
diarrhea

2756.48 --> 2761.92
or was there some actual in content

2762.359 --> 2768.52
criticism cuz I mean people can really

2766.28 --> 2771.88
do that you know they could actually

2768.52 --> 2775.52
analyze what I do and find

2771.88 --> 2779.28
pretty like very noticeable points of

2775.52 --> 2779.28
criticism you could make about my

2779.359 --> 2784.7999999999997
activities it's a

2781.44 --> 2787.8
short what what do you mean it's a

2823.319 --> 2829.72
guess I'll just share it with Nathan

2826.359 --> 2832.88

going

3073.96 --> 3078.359
[ __ ] I mean that would be pretty

3076.119 --> 3079.96
ridiculous If he if he did

3078.359 --> 3084.359
that

3079.96 --> 3088.2
so yeah that fake fake

3084.359 --> 3092.44
Channel could very well be

3088.2 --> 3092.4399999999996
CIA but it's not actually

3098.16 --> 3103.7599999999998
RV you would like to see Q well that's

3101.16 --> 3105.799
your [ __ ] problem terret that you're

3122.319 --> 3127.72
fine want to see QE treatment there's

3125.72 --> 3129.2799999999997
plenty of other people that deserve a

3127.72 --> 3132.2
good treatment out

3129.28 --> 3134.52
there send the link to the real I just

3132.2 --> 3134.52
did

3144.28 --> 3147.28
that

3154.079 --> 3156.599
yeah that's

3159.72 --> 3166.799
right right so those subs on that fake

3163.359 --> 3170.0
RV channel are very very obviously

3166.799 --> 3173.44
blatantly edited like that's like a CIA

3170.0 --> 3176.079
trick that's somebody that's just

3173.44 --> 3178.64
like complete Mirage

3176.079 --> 3182.3590000000004
just using YouTube

3178.64 --> 3187.24
editing to just make up complete

3182.359 --> 3189.88
[ __ ] so it is like CIA or FBI infiltrate

3187.24 --> 3193.8799999999997
like pretending to be somebody else they

3189.88 --> 3193.88
do that they're really [ __ ]

3204.16 --> 3207.16
nasty

3221.52 --> 3228.96
all right so fake RV not the real

3224.72 --> 3231.52
one the real one has not turned into a

3228.96 --> 3237.04
complete

3231.52 --> 3241.24
spaz it's only minor spaz ftic traits

3237.04 --> 3241.24
very very within tolerance

3251.96 --> 3255.96
[Music]

3263.079 --> 3269.3590000000004
limits we create these m if he inspired

3266.319 --> 3269.359
people never learn

3273.319 --> 3276.52
reasoning a

3281.359 --> 3288.319
bit or he just addresses the people that

3285.0 --> 3290.55
are already there you know there's just

3288.319 --> 3293.629
people like that that are like

3290.55 --> 3293.6290000000004
[Music]

3294.079 --> 3297.079
that

3324.0 --> 3327.0
ah

3354.0 --> 3357.0
for

3362.48 --> 3368.799
yeah teret but I mean

3365.28 --> 3372.8390000000004
duh but I mean there's a huge difference

3368.799 --> 3374.92
between RV and QE there right I mean

3372.839 --> 3378.319
seems kind of

3374.92 --> 3380.96
blatant RV not having like an academic

3378.319 --> 3383.2
background QE

3380.96 --> 3386.48
does

3383.2 --> 3390.0789999999997
duh RV's just like a conspiracy guy

3386.48 --> 3395.28
that's also a flat earther yeah

3390.079 --> 3398.039
qwi is like a physics academic

3395.28 --> 3402.52
guy that became a flat

3398.039 --> 3402.5200000000004
earther it's a totally different

3412.24 --> 3418.0789999999997
background Alaska te and then he calls

3415.76 --> 3418.079
all their

3421.839 --> 3429.0389999999998
Shields it doesn't appreciate

3424.359 --> 3431.68
others yeah could be there's just easily

3429.039 --> 3437.039
jealous I mean RV does have like a bit

3431.68 --> 3440.2
of a gamma streak like he is envious in

3437.039 --> 3443.7990000000004
nature he has issues with that but I

3440.2 --> 3446.799
mean it's not a full spaz or

3443.799 --> 3446.799
anything

3456.72 --> 3465.9199999999996
and hey he has entertaining

3460.92 --> 3469.559
ideas so enough RV is just [ __ ] fine

3465.92 --> 3472.2400000000002
yeah RV is great you hear me teret stop

3469.559 --> 3472.2400000000002
[ __ ] on

3472.44 --> 3479.64
RV done yeah we don't need more to point

3476.839 --> 3481.2
at more people to surgically remove from

3479.64 --> 3483.1189999999997
our community because they're not

3481.2 --> 3487.16
perfect enough

3483.119 --> 3487.1600000000003
okay is that clear

3501.16 --> 3507.48
terret what we do need however is to

3504.24 --> 3512.5589999999997
send me support or I'm going to run out

3507.48 --> 3512.559
of food completely that is what I do

3513.44 --> 3518.319
need I'm going to need it before

3515.839 --> 3518.319
tomorrow

3523.27 --> 3526.34
[Music]

3527.799 --> 3533.559
morning thanks for the compliment there

3530.28 --> 3533.559
but yeah let's move

3533.72 --> 3536.72
on

3539.24 --> 3544.3999999999996
because I need support I'm going to keep

3542.039 --> 3544.4
saying

3549.96 --> 3554.599
it basically have to get through roughly

3553.079 --> 3558.2400000000002
a

3554.599 --> 3561.2000000000003
week and when I say a week actually a

3558.24 --> 3565.359
week a week where I have zero income yet

3561.2 --> 3569.48
I need to survive somehow foodwise

3565.359 --> 3569.48
right income is through you

3569.68 --> 3573.839
guys any support would be

3579.4 --> 3588.119
great hey and if I do get it I'll even

3584.799 --> 3590.839
like let's just say I'll be more on time

3588.119 --> 3593.6400000000003
how about that yeah if I get more

3590.839 --> 3595.52
support I'll be more on time how about

3593.64 --> 3597.799
that

3595.52 --> 3601.72
it technically works out like that

3597.799 --> 3604.559
anyway because hey if I'm like fully

3601.72 --> 3607.68
supplied then I don't dwell as much then

3604.559 --> 3610.88
I don't stay up as

3607.68 --> 3615.319
late eat well and all that and then I do

3610.88 --> 3615.319
just like get up earlier

3621.599 --> 3627.319
anyway I I don't have to worry all the

3624.319 --> 3632.7599999999998
time about finances then I don't stress

3627.319 --> 3632.7599999999998
myself out as much and then I live more

3636.05 --> 3639.239
[Music]

3643.64 --> 3650.72
stably so Nathan's got his computer

3646.359 --> 3656.52
together now can I get some food here

3650.72 --> 3656.52
maybe is that too much to ask

3670.319 --> 3675.799
Nathan can get his computer parts can I

3672.68 --> 3675.799
get my food

3683.44 --> 3686.44
please

3713.16 --> 3719.2
why you need help with food because

3715.48 --> 3722.4
financially it's all just

3719.2 --> 3724.3999999999996
terrible yeah prices have gone up

3722.4 --> 3729.039
dramatically for

3724.4 --> 3729.039
everything while the income has not gone

3730.72 --> 3737.5989999999997
up

3733.559 --> 3740.119
so yeah my rent has dramatically gone up

3737.599 --> 3743.4
last year might have forgotten

3740.119 --> 3747.6400000000003
that and so all the money that I do get

3743.4 --> 3751.359
it's not enough I can't get by I can't

3747.64 --> 3754.44
get food with my income that I get

3751.359 --> 3759.44
without support I literally

3754.44 --> 3766.2400000000002
starve yeah if I quit the show entirely

3759.44 --> 3766.2400000000002
I'd still starve yeah I need

3773.359 --> 3776.359
support

3781.24 --> 3788.52
but others survive with the r money

3783.24 --> 3791.9599999999996
right no no they don't Mato they

3788.52 --> 3795.88
don't they are in big trouble everywhere

3791.96 --> 3798.2400000000002
people are living like poor lives now

3795.88 --> 3798.2400000000002
out

3802.0 --> 3808.279
there yeah cuz eventually the only way

3806.0 --> 3810.599
to survive that is to basically be just

3808.279 --> 3812.319
shipped around like a bunch of bums to

3810.599 --> 3815.2400000000002
places where there is some food and

3812.319 --> 3817.7599999999998
shelter and that's it that's what that

3815.24 --> 3821.5989999999997
leads to eventually

3817.76 --> 3825.92
yeah there's a massive Siege Happening

3821.599 --> 3825.92
Here in the Netherlands financially

3827.24 --> 3833.279
politically like food prices doubled

3831.119 --> 3837.9500000000003
yeah

3833.279 --> 3841.12
doubled yeah income did

3837.95 --> 3841.12
[Music]

3845.31 --> 3848.42

3857.079 --> 3862.6800000000003
