67.159 --> 77.06
so Oh everyone beautiful weather today

74.35 --> 83.03
not hot enough for me to take off my

77.06 --> 88.119
t-shirt but it's really nice nice and

83.03 --> 90.77
sunny and not too hot also the wind has

88.119 --> 97.55
significantly gone down which is very

90.77 --> 101.06
pleasant yeah beautiful day and there

97.55 --> 104.53999999999999
was a special rainbow rainbow yesterday

101.06 --> 107.75
as some of you may have caught although

104.54 --> 109.61000000000001
for some reason the yeah the sound

107.75 --> 113.87
didn't record as I would do as I was

109.61 --> 115.91
doing that and as soon as I uploaded it

113.87 --> 118.67
the rainbow was gone so I didn't get a

115.91 --> 123.58
second chance but I thought I wasn't

118.67 --> 126.77
looking was very late in the evening and

123.58 --> 128.509
it was straight in the opposite

126.77 --> 134.56
direction of where the Sun was coming

128.509 --> 134.55999999999997
from so it looked really just strange

135.42 --> 144.20899999999997
but still very visibly there anyway uh

139.53 --> 150.09
yeah yeah it just did that felt like

144.209 --> 152.4
so today yeah today I only have t know

150.09 --> 154.44
Tamara coffee you know nothing else I

152.4 --> 158.99
had a pretty early lunch

154.44 --> 162.32999999999998
and I already had two coffees I kind of

158.99 --> 168.62
yeah dove into the coffee I'm not gonna

162.33 --> 168.62
take a third one the hell well

176.04 --> 180.39
so let's see who is in chat

181.36 --> 190.0
AG em steve-dave Gifford

186.88 --> 192.06
it's McLeod sleeping warrior I had a bit

190.0 --> 197.44
of a hangover Amanda young

192.06 --> 202.87
over McCool lumberjack Karen be good to

197.44 --> 207.91
see you all huh so yesterday's hangout

202.87 --> 211.72
was quite a blast and it didn't even get

207.91 --> 218.17
through it I basically went back to the

211.72 --> 221.77
part or I figured out the approach as to

218.17 --> 225.91
how sine how to establish what moonlight

221.77 --> 229.63000000000002
really does reflecting back on some raw

225.91 --> 234.35999999999999
tests that I did in the past surrounding

229.63 --> 238.68
the vast claims that moonlight is cold

234.36 --> 243.19000000000003
creates a temperature decrease

238.68 --> 244.9
measurably so so yeah I gave some kind

243.19 --> 248.53
of explanation for it and in order to

244.9 --> 251.34
test what's really going on and I was

248.53 --> 251.34
rather impressed

251.94 --> 257.95
in retrospect because I did that was not

255.94 --> 259.66
something I had planned as I said in the

257.95 --> 263.56
moment just somebody asks a question and

259.66 --> 267.49
just I saw it I talked about it with my

263.56 --> 271.0
dad also and it's literally like I'm

267.49 --> 276.58
just trying to stay on the path just

271.0 --> 280.68
going straight keeping it pure writing

276.58 --> 284.56
it and then sometimes if you're lucky

280.68 --> 289.72
god oh it almost feels like it he just

284.56 --> 293.38
comes by and drops you packages and in

289.72 --> 294.88000000000005
my case ideas just get this amazing

293.38 --> 299.71
energy and suddenly everything

294.88 --> 301.93
crystallizes perfectly clear and it when

299.71 --> 305.38
it happens it's just like a pure

301.93 --> 314.35
enthusiasm and it doesn't even feel like

305.38 --> 319.12
I made that I just allowed it I made it

314.35 --> 321.61
possible to catch it that's pretty much

319.12 --> 329.7
it that that feels what I've done with

321.61 --> 329.7
it and ya know it fascinated me also the

329.88 --> 336.01
yeah the long conversation with em

332.86 --> 337.69
Rick's j-mac who in retrospect maybe

336.01 --> 340.15
called mr. Rick's

337.69 --> 343.66
j-mac because there's two R's in there I

340.15 --> 347.02
didn't see that I'm just calling him

343.66 --> 349.84000000000003
Emmerich's Jay Mac I don't know why but

347.02 --> 352.03
that was fascinating although it did you

349.84 --> 354.90999999999997
guys must have noticed that as soon as

352.03 --> 358.69
he started to talk about him having

354.91 --> 360.97
multiple personalities that that was

358.69 --> 366.0
pretty shocking to just like oh yeah

360.97 --> 369.37
bang because it does give a bit of extra

366.0 --> 371.83
responsibility to me of course the guy

369.37 --> 375.49
he's older than me he knows how to

371.83 --> 378.82
manage himself obviously but still it's

375.49 --> 380.11
just like oh okay I got to be extra

378.82 --> 387.159
careful

380.11 --> 390.039
not to make a mistake but I did say to

387.159 --> 392.319
rough off the edges but it was a very

390.039 --> 394.93
interesting conversation mostly

392.319 --> 397.509
fortunately I kind of did over talk him

394.93 --> 400.36
at time so muddied up a little after a

397.509 --> 402.58000000000004
while but still great talk and the guy

400.36 --> 409.47900000000004
was indeed very smart and it was

402.58 --> 412.84
interesting to be able to see how

409.479 --> 414.599
somebody is just sharing how they are

412.84 --> 425.59
managing their faculties it's

414.599 --> 428.55
fascinating so yet to me yesterday was

425.59 --> 428.54999999999995
quite inspiring

431.61 --> 437.91900000000004
fortunately financially speaking I'm

435.639 --> 441.069
actually at a kind of a steel water at

437.919 --> 443.59
the moment and I kind of decided because

441.069 --> 446.28900000000004
I'm forced to well

443.59 --> 451.06
because it's complicated like my dad's

446.289 --> 455.469
also kind of run into a temporary halt

451.06 --> 460.449
on things financially so I now basically

455.469 --> 464.5
forced to stop smoking entirely or

460.449 --> 466.33000000000004
almost entirely and I'm kind of fine

464.5 --> 468.52
with that it's like not a fun thing to

466.33 --> 473.31899999999996
be forced in but I kind of wanted to

468.52 --> 478.599
stop it anyway and now have to that yeah

473.319 --> 482.009
it is what it is and things could

478.599 --> 485.589
restore back to normal

482.009 --> 489.75
probably quick enough in a week or so

485.589 --> 489.75
but for now

490.9 --> 504.90999999999997
I gotta slow it down and to be fair my

502.21 --> 511.53999999999996
lungs and the rest of my organs are kind

504.91 --> 514.48
of happy with the news so because yeah

511.54 --> 516.94
the whole smoking thing it is kind of it

514.48 --> 520.66
is interesting it is pleasurable it does

516.94 --> 523.45
do things positively but also there is

520.66 --> 526.18
the side effects and that is like the

523.45 --> 530.23
inner turmoil that just like the

526.18 --> 533.2299999999999
response from the organs and sometimes

530.23 --> 537.61
especially more recently in the last few

533.23 --> 540.46
months that it's like yeah my organs are

537.61 --> 545.29
kind of getting sick of it that that

540.46 --> 546.94
kind of response as in hey I know hello

545.29 --> 550.3
there are wait and I know you're really

546.94 --> 554.44
enjoying it and you're seeming to keep

550.3 --> 556.87
things rolling but you know we're kind

554.44 --> 560.2900000000001
of having a hard time with this it's not

556.87 --> 562.83
as enjoyable on the inside that it's I

560.29 --> 567.25
don't know that's just how it

562.83 --> 568.75
communicates with me through frequency

567.25 --> 580.81
it's not like I'm literally hearing

568.75 --> 583.48
voices coming from inside yeah it's

580.81 --> 586.9899999999999
MacLeod indeed but it's also tobacco now

583.48 --> 590.94
I have a lot of tobacco remnants because

586.99 --> 593.92
I don't know but it is pretty disgusting

590.94 --> 596.62
to smoke that so that'll just further

593.92 --> 597.7199999999999
the encouragement to just like new let's

596.62 --> 600.72
not do that

597.72 --> 603.49
but if I like to really need a hit

600.72 --> 606.0400000000001
because of circumstances whatever

603.49 --> 609.3
stressed and that like otherwise I'd

606.04 --> 615.3
feel sick then I still have something

609.3 --> 615.3
like an emergency bit of dust

617.589 --> 623.9590000000001
but technically I should have quit I

621.55 --> 626.899
should have never really restarted

623.959 --> 631.91
smoking tobacco anyway as I did two

626.899 --> 635.27
years ago in May I I kind of broke a

631.91 --> 637.67
promise to myself when I did that but it

635.27 --> 640.43
was like a medical emergency and it did

637.67 --> 641.39
help a lot but then I got hooked onto

640.43 --> 643.279
that again

641.39 --> 646.399
that's always the problem with it

643.279 --> 648.529
especially tobacco once it becomes

646.399 --> 659.95
really welcome it refuses to go away

648.529 --> 666.1
again yeah anyway this is just for now

659.95 --> 666.1
you genetically modified weed

669.81 --> 677.38
well not over here as far as I know I

673.83 --> 680.13
have no idea what they're doing in the

677.38 --> 680.13
United States

691.2 --> 695.6600000000001
all right

692.9 --> 698.75
yeah I'd love to grow my own I have done

695.66 --> 702.67
that in the past but I don't really have

698.75 --> 705.56
the the proper space for it and

702.67 --> 709.61
especially one side harvest like where

705.56 --> 712.9699999999999
the hell am I gonna dry that stuff it's

709.61 --> 721.67
not I I just don't I can't manage that

712.97 --> 725.9300000000001
right now no flats oide I'm never gonna

721.67 --> 731.24
have a proper beard I don't got the

725.93 --> 733.67
facial hey it's not there I'm lucky

731.24 --> 736.58
enough to be able to grow a mustache and

733.67 --> 741.1999999999999
I'll get some sideburns oh yeah that

736.58 --> 744.22
those will work but a real beard no I'm

741.2 --> 744.22
an elf it doesn't work

755.35 --> 757.95
yep

765.03 --> 767.75
No

767.96 --> 774.8000000000001
now there's no mustache competition no I

772.88 --> 777.2
there's even times where I just consider

774.8 --> 780.17
shaving it off again because I'm not

777.2 --> 781.6400000000001
really that happy with it especially I

780.17 --> 783.41
don't know especially when I look up

781.64 --> 788.6899999999999
close it's just not that super

783.41 --> 794.17
impressive but to be fair I especially

788.69 --> 794.1700000000001
when I feel good I do have some I get I

796.57 --> 805.0400000000001
don't know I do get signals that the

802.22 --> 807.76
ladies find it attractive and I do

805.04 --> 807.76
appreciate that

828.7 --> 831.4200000000001
hmm

833.79 --> 839.24
ouais really if you clean up that much

848.25 --> 855.45
uh-huh oh that's impressive if that's

851.25 --> 858.45
really true I never had much control

855.45 --> 861.12
over drug use that's why I very wisely

858.45 --> 866.7900000000001
stayed away absolutely stayed away from

861.12 --> 870.99
most of it especially like the really

866.79 --> 875.63
heavy [ __ ] I never tried cocaine ever

870.99 --> 878.94
tried and things like heroin you I never

875.63 --> 884.0
know yeah I did I never even tried like

878.94 --> 884.0
ecstasy her terrible stories about that

885.32 --> 890.9100000000001
because I'd probably get very seriously

888.57 --> 892.86
addicted to that on the other hand I

890.91 --> 898.56
don't know if it even would matter

892.86 --> 903.84
because I think that by myself I have a

898.56 --> 907.53
pretty high good feeling output hormone

903.84 --> 912.57
Lee inside myself it's just that I also

907.53 --> 915.27
am very receptive to things like fear so

912.57 --> 917.13
I have a high response to all of it but

915.27 --> 919.68
if things like ecstasy that just

917.13 --> 924.48
wouldn't do anything to me it would just

919.68 --> 927.5999999999999
rip my brain apart or like overkill me

924.48 --> 930.24
overkill happiness which just turns you

927.6 --> 935.6700000000001
into E in a happy little plant well

930.24 --> 938.3100000000001
that's just a complete waste of time so

935.67 --> 940.9499999999999
I yeah I know I've stayed away from all

938.31 --> 943.8
of it the only thing that I kind of did

940.95 --> 948.9000000000001
try but it's also kind of out of

943.8 --> 952.17
curiosity is like methamphetamine but

948.9 --> 953.85
just a very very tiny man like the guy

952.17 --> 957.15
was like oh you've never tried it okay

953.85 --> 959.46
do this and I was like okay I'll take

957.15 --> 964.1999999999999
like a quarter of that thank you very

959.46 --> 968.73
much because yeah I knew that it's also

964.2 --> 970.71
being used to treat hyperactivity and

968.73 --> 973.2
I've been known to have that and I've

970.71 --> 977.34
always refused ritalin a hundred percent

973.2 --> 978.57
but I just wanted to see what it would

977.34 --> 983.52
do

978.57 --> 985.35
basically and I wanted to see like is

983.52 --> 989.79
this an interesting experience well it

985.35 --> 993.27
sucked it was the proper setting for it

989.79 --> 998.61
I was like at a punk a little trashy

993.27 --> 1001.85
looking punk party some old building

998.61 --> 1005.87
it was very proper everything for it but

1001.85 --> 1008.5
it just it sucked I was like like yeah I

1005.87 --> 1013.39
want to do stuff I want to do stuff but

1008.5 --> 1017.0
but you can't do anything it sucked

1013.39 --> 1019.25
like being overly driven and focused but

1017.0 --> 1021.14
there's nothing really you can latch on

1019.25 --> 1024.709
to it's a terrible state of mind it just

1021.14 --> 1031.76
sucked so I never try that again never

1024.709 --> 1037.22
one to even it's just junk it it breaks

1031.76 --> 1039.589
away my clear sight that skill that it

1037.22 --> 1043.43
just takes that away it cuts me off from

1039.589 --> 1046.07
that it draws all the attention more

1043.43 --> 1053.0
intensely to the middle and I don't need

1046.07 --> 1057.53
that there's no use for that at all so

1053.0 --> 1059.57
that sucked and other than that I don't

1057.53 --> 1061.52
know I've had quite some wild adventures

1059.57 --> 1064.37
just with different types of alcohol and

1061.52 --> 1066.56
things and I've been into apps in for a

1064.37 --> 1069.77
while especially in the goth scene it's

1066.56 --> 1073.58
like yeah they serve that [ __ ] at

1069.77 --> 1076.8799999999999
several types of parties and that's been

1073.58 --> 1081.26
interesting sort of but then again

1076.88 --> 1083.5700000000002
things like mushrooms yeah I talked with

1081.26 --> 1086.24
a lot of people that did that stuff in

1083.57 --> 1088.07
several ways I knew there was something

1086.24 --> 1091.79
very special about it but I've never

1088.07 --> 1093.95
really tried it and the funny thing was

1091.79 --> 1096.62
that's also because I don't like

1093.95 --> 1099.17
mushrooms I don't like eating them I

1096.62 --> 1104.6599999999999
don't like the way they taste and they

1099.17 --> 1106.79
feel but I do eat them in meals for

1104.66 --> 1111.5600000000002
health purposes so for example certain

1106.79 --> 1115.46
meals I would a soup I would add

1111.56 --> 1117.29
shiitake mushrooms to that in just

1115.46 --> 1119.03
little pieces and just kind of like yeah

1117.29 --> 1122.27
it's really healthy it's really healthy

1119.03 --> 1124.28
and that kind of it's not bad it feels

1122.27 --> 1127.31
good to eat but I just don't like

1124.28 --> 1128.8999999999999
mushrooms so it's the mushroom special

1127.31 --> 1130.61
mushroom has never been very appealing

1128.9 --> 1135.0700000000002
to me and people tell me they taste

1130.61 --> 1138.8899999999999
disgusting so yeah never tried that

1135.07 --> 1140.6899999999998
don't really feel the need to I what

1138.89 --> 1147.5
I've heard mostly it's just a lot of

1140.69 --> 1149.51
visuals and it's like using your brain

1147.5 --> 1154.7
to dangle a bunch of keys in front of

1149.51 --> 1157.07
you you know I don't know that's it

1154.7 --> 1159.47
would be interesting to have like how

1157.07 --> 1161.1499999999999
you say borderline dark world

1159.47 --> 1164.1200000000001
experiences and I did hear stories about

1161.15 --> 1168.14
that how they would sense the presence

1164.12 --> 1170.87
of a spirit and that it would like

1168.14 --> 1173.0
manifest like a light to them that those

1170.87 --> 1177.56
kind of heard fascinating stories from

1173.0 --> 1182.57
it but that never been really drawn to

1177.56 --> 1187.37
try that what mushrooms are more

1182.57 --> 1189.55
cerebral they're visual really that's

1187.37 --> 1189.55
interesting

1190.61 --> 1195.35
most people that I talked maybe it's

1193.16 --> 1199.3700000000001
because they weren't that intelligent

1195.35 --> 1202.3999999999999
that they just had a lot of visuals even

1199.37 --> 1206.33
just like regular party drug users when

1202.4 --> 1207.6100000000001
I get my special filters unfortunately

1206.33 --> 1210.9499999999998
I'm out right now

1207.61 --> 1212.78
in the smart shop there's like all kinds

1210.95 --> 1216.05
of stuff they sell their party drugs

1212.78 --> 1218.48
stuff like everything legal but there's

1216.05 --> 1220.6399999999999
people that come there and I hear some

1218.48 --> 1223.73
stories sometimes when I'm just standing

1220.64 --> 1226.1200000000001
there waiting and most of it's just over

1223.73 --> 1232.01
visuals are just want to feel really

1226.12 --> 1233.9199999999998
like this and so the stories that I've

1232.01 --> 1236.92
heard all around have been just mostly

1233.92 --> 1236.92
visuals

1241.25 --> 1251.78
I but yeah you know what I don't really

1247.46 --> 1255.74
recommend that stuff either unless you

1251.78 --> 1258.79
have a very special setting for it so

1255.74 --> 1258.79
for example

1264.059 --> 1269.969
if you're in the middle of like a

1266.009 --> 1272.69
learning process or like a spiritual

1269.969 --> 1276.749
discovery if you have a purpose

1272.69 --> 1279.1190000000001
then a mushroom could be very fast it

1276.749 --> 1283.169
would be like a shamanic tool all of a

1279.119 --> 1285.6899999999998
sudden - for to reach something to find

1283.169 --> 1288.7990000000002
something to take it series and that's

1285.69 --> 1290.8490000000002
very different from just a group order

1288.799 --> 1292.979
because that's useless

1290.849 --> 1295.4689999999998
pretty much in my opinion although you

1292.979 --> 1299.3890000000001
might accidentally stumble upon an

1295.469 --> 1299.3890000000001
experience that is enlightening but

1303.679 --> 1309.479
right but you know what in in the times

1307.169 --> 1309.96
when I was interested in that kind of

1309.479 --> 1312.6290000000001
thing

1309.96 --> 1315.059
I just didn't use mushrooms because the

1312.629 --> 1317.879
freaking cannabis was just doing all of

1315.059 --> 1321.96
that I didn't need anything I was

1317.879 --> 1326.099
literally at times where I was just it

1321.96 --> 1329.969
felt like I was walking in the two

1326.099 --> 1334.109
dimensions at the same time felt it was

1329.969 --> 1336.3300000000002
pretty intense I didn't like was very

1334.109 --> 1340.9189999999999
clear like I don't need any kind of

1336.33 --> 1343.4289999999999
substance to to reach further know I

1340.919 --> 1346.1390000000001
could grasp all kinds of things like

1343.429 --> 1348.029
what happened yesterday that an idea

1346.139 --> 1351.119
would just come falling out of the sky

1348.029 --> 1353.309
that happened back then the less useful

1351.119 --> 1356.309
setting unfortunately but that happened

1353.309 --> 1358.859
constantly especially when I got high

1356.309 --> 1361.6789999999999
just the idea started just jumping out

1358.859 --> 1365.309
of there fortunately I didn't have a lot

1361.679 --> 1368.759
of good grounding in order to make those

1365.309 --> 1371.039
ideas actually useful now I have a much

1368.759 --> 1373.169
better grounding a much more grounded

1371.039 --> 1375.149
sense of what is real and what isn't and

1373.169 --> 1378.539
thus the ideas that are going to be

1375.149 --> 1382.4599999999998
dropping are also going to be much more

1378.539 --> 1386.62
real and useful in nature I believe

1382.46 --> 1391.2
that's what it seems to me

1386.62 --> 1404.7399999999998
yeah sorry maybe a bit fake

1391.2 --> 1407.07
that's very clear to me big cloud coming

1404.74 --> 1407.07
over

1416.62 --> 1419.25
you

1419.41 --> 1425.23
kind of nice and fresh bit of shade

1430.62 --> 1437.9699999999998
yeah I am by the way talking about trips

1434.429 --> 1441.419
and stuff I heard so many strange

1437.97 --> 1443.82
stories from my parents from people they

1441.419 --> 1446.279
knew because yeah they were in the music

1443.82 --> 1448.9189999999999
business and you bet your ass that those

1446.279 --> 1452.25
people a lot of them were like into

1448.919 --> 1456.419
drugs and stuff all over the place it's

1452.25 --> 1465.99
a crazy story sometimes they use very

1456.419 --> 1469.1100000000001
risky type of stuff it's like this weird

1465.99 --> 1473.3990000000001
type of plan yeah I think I told this

1469.11 --> 1475.86
story before once like one of their

1473.399 --> 1479.25
colleagues a musician took that stuff

1475.86 --> 1481.59
and then woke up three days later and he

1479.25 --> 1483.51
had just sit sat there as soon as he

1481.59 --> 1485.8799999999999
took that for three days straight and he

1483.51 --> 1488.179
was all skinny and totally dried out it

1485.88 --> 1492.2700000000002
was it was lucky to have survived that

1488.179 --> 1497.3600000000001
and he just literally catatonic nothing

1492.27 --> 1501.77
no time-lapse nothing just what the [ __ ]

1497.36 --> 1501.77
so yeah weird [ __ ] can happen

1504.2 --> 1513.409
hello reckoner stefan Alderson the topic

1507.809 --> 1513.4089999999999
today seems to be drugs so it seems

1524.41 --> 1529.42
yeah I get I don't know the name let me

1528.88 --> 1533.8300000000002
see

1529.42 --> 1535.93
I feel hesitant to even share this kind

1533.83 --> 1540.97
of stuff with people because I don't

1535.93 --> 1542.77
know yeah people could do some really

1540.97 --> 1544.8700000000001
nasty pranks with that stuff on the

1542.77 --> 1546.34
other hat is just literally if they

1544.87 --> 1548.6699999999998
would they would just be poisoning

1546.34 --> 1548.6699999999998
people

1564.02 --> 1566.8899999999999
okay

1578.23 --> 1584.35
right well according to this direct

1582.19 --> 1587.8
translation Funi it's called either

1584.35 --> 1590.7099999999998
jimsonweed or pretty much a literal

1587.8 --> 1596.11
translation of Thornapple it's a weird

1590.71 --> 1601.3
kind of tropical looking thing anyway

1596.11 --> 1603.28
just never try that it's literally bad

1601.3 --> 1605.8
news there's no way you can get any kind

1603.28 --> 1616.81
of good trip out of that it's just

1605.8 --> 1620.29
poison and you know what there's all

1616.81 --> 1622.57
kinds of this weird stuff that that's

1620.29 --> 1626.68
like borderline considered drugs or

1622.57 --> 1629.5
that's just very unhealthy just don't do

1626.68 --> 1634.18
that you know if you want to go party

1629.5 --> 1639.01
drools and you're gonna and I just stick

1634.18 --> 1642.5800000000002
to to the more traditional mushroom

1639.01 --> 1647.74
types and just be safe about it because

1642.58 --> 1651.1599999999999
a lot of other drug party drugs that are

1647.74 --> 1654.97
just more experimental they can have all

1651.16 --> 1658.65
kinds of it's usually a hallucinogen

1654.97 --> 1663.67
based things are just pure poison and

1658.65 --> 1665.47
you're lucky if one of those types of

1663.67 --> 1668.8000000000002
poisons like with the mushrooms has a

1665.47 --> 1670.93
very special effect without just causing

1668.8 --> 1673.8899999999999
a lot of damage because that is what

1670.93 --> 1676.72
most poisons do hallucination is

1673.89 --> 1681.01
normally a sign that you're receiving

1676.72 --> 1681.76
point damage from poison literally

1681.01 --> 1684.64
that's what that is

1681.76 --> 1686.32
so if you're hallucinating and you're

1684.64 --> 1690.46
not getting seriously damaged you're

1686.32 --> 1694.1499999999999
lucky so you shouldn't pursue that type

1690.46 --> 1697.8700000000001
of experience in general it's just not

1694.15 --> 1701.0400000000002
healthy to do illusion Asians are a bad

1697.87 --> 1701.04
sign normally

1703.92 --> 1712.65
yeah just so you know and people can

1709.18 --> 1720.6100000000001
even hallucinate from oxygen deprivation

1712.65 --> 1723.8200000000002
for example this poison yeah that's what

1720.61 --> 1727.2099999999998
causes it and but yeah on the other hand

1723.82 --> 1729.46
there are very special materials made by

1727.21 --> 1731.77
Nature even with the cannabis it's very

1729.46 --> 1736.33
special and it can result in these

1731.77 --> 1740.77
effects but but it is like it was

1736.33 --> 1742.54
designed to do that and not just like as

1740.77 --> 1746.95
a warning sign all your getting damaged

1742.54 --> 1750.7
no it's mushrooms I think and cannabis

1746.95 --> 1754.45
they're made they were designed by God

1750.7 --> 1757.66
to do that and to test us

1754.45 --> 1760.51
also it's part of the test like even in

1757.66 --> 1762.46
shaman rituals or all those kind of

1760.51 --> 1765.82
things in the direction of magic and

1762.46 --> 1768.25
spirituality that go that way that do it

1765.82 --> 1775.6499999999999
like that it is a test it's always a

1768.25 --> 1775.65
test and that makes sense

1779.67 --> 1787.6100000000001
but yeah other stuff that just makes you

1783.47 --> 1794.4
act stranger make you see things that's

1787.61 --> 1801.33
usually just not good for you you know

1794.4 --> 1805.52
you consider this that mercury at times

1801.33 --> 1809.6399999999999
was even used as a treatment because it

1805.52 --> 1811.74
would burn out certain things in you so

1809.64 --> 1815.2800000000002
they could potentially not bother you

1811.74 --> 1819.65
it's crazy how that works but it's

1815.28 --> 1823.62
literally just poisoning yeah in general

1819.65 --> 1828.27
but there are some special plants made

1823.62 --> 1835.9399999999998
by God designed to have another type of

1828.27 --> 1835.94
effect it's not just poison anyway

1844.68 --> 1855.18
Oh God that story bill G yeah I read it

1852.15 --> 1864.5900000000001
the star that is older than universe

1855.18 --> 1867.39
it's just an embarrassing they're just

1864.59 --> 1873.3799999999999
trying to recreate some kind of weird

1867.39 --> 1878.24
God I think back into the Helius look

1873.38 --> 1884.49
consider this how things are steered

1878.24 --> 1888.99
it's obvious that the non-death culture

1884.49 --> 1891.75
wants Christianity and a God like it is

1888.99 --> 1894.48
still all it seems like it's getting

1891.75 --> 1898.02
integrated like globe space universe

1894.48 --> 1903.5
there are attempts to take away the

1898.02 --> 1906.69
cold-heartedness of of atheism and of

1903.5 --> 1909.87
Darwinism and all that that's very

1906.69 --> 1912.27
clearly dark and to put an alternative

1909.87 --> 1915.6899999999998
path to that to still keep this space

1912.27 --> 1918.84
and all that but somehow were God into

1915.69 --> 1921.81
it to recognize creation and then to

1918.84 --> 1926.79
find God within that space cosmos like

1921.81 --> 1930.78
Star Trek's Star Trek 6 that movie or

1926.79 --> 1935.0
was it five no it was five sorry looking

1930.78 --> 1937.59
for God beyond the barrier it and I

1935.0 --> 1942.0
think this is kind of going that

1937.59 --> 1944.82
direction like people accepting that

1942.0 --> 1951.63
creation and God are now trying to find

1944.82 --> 1954.45
God in their illusionary creation so

1951.63 --> 1957.0
there's gonna be probably more ideas

1954.45 --> 1958.8300000000002
that are going to be spawned like this

1957.0 --> 1961.83
because they're trying to reintegrate

1958.83 --> 1964.59
the concept of the creator and God back

1961.83 --> 1967.31
into a heliocentric universe because

1964.59 --> 1971.0
they don't want to let go of that one

1967.31 --> 1971.0
what do you guys think

1981.28 --> 1983.85
yeah

1985.53 --> 1992.93
Oh God a proof of a multiverse sure

1989.93 --> 1992.93
whatever

1993.44 --> 2000.95
so multi-version nonsense is getting

1996.54 --> 2004.79
really annoying like a multiverse is

2000.95 --> 2007.88
it's not gonna be in any way physically

2004.79 --> 2010.01
relevant to our universe if you even

2007.88 --> 2012.0200000000002
presume it it's there unless there's

2010.01 --> 2014.24
some weird opening but that's afterwards

2012.02 --> 2017.02
how can you even say that's all supposed

2014.24 --> 2017.02
to be connected

2033.54 --> 2040.53
I just don't think there are like I've

2037.4 --> 2043.1100000000001
inquired information even from the

2040.53 --> 2046.08
spiritual realm it's kind of weird now

2043.11 --> 2048.48
that I hear myself saying that but I did

2046.08 --> 2050.0699999999997
at the time it was a very serious quest

2048.48 --> 2054.27
for information it was during my

2050.07 --> 2058.6490000000003
symbolic time when I was making this and

2054.27 --> 2062.25
when I had my yeah my strange

2058.649 --> 2065.79
experiences with the medium and and that

2062.25 --> 2068.49
yeah all that and was inquiring and one

2065.79 --> 2073.5
of the things that I really asked kept

2068.49 --> 2076.2299999999996
on asking and I did get an answer to

2073.5 --> 2082.02
that with some a medium that I highly

2076.23 --> 2084.78
respect and they confirmed that the

2082.02 --> 2088.53
earth is the earth is the there's only

2084.78 --> 2094.1290000000004
one material plane that's literally how

2088.53 --> 2094.1290000000004
I even asked it it didn't even mean I

2094.55 --> 2101.369
wasn't even thinking about Flat Earth

2098.64 --> 2105.42
versus globe in outer space no I was

2101.369 --> 2108.15
just thinking of the material of this

2105.42 --> 2111.38
universe as it were and I was wondering

2108.15 --> 2114.33
like is this the only material plane and

2111.38 --> 2116.73
well all the spirits and this is

2114.33 --> 2118.89
completely besides any of the opinions

2116.73 --> 2124.88
of those persons that were carried that

2118.89 --> 2128.0699999999997
were doing these tasks because they I

2124.88 --> 2130.88
would never expect them to even dare to

2128.07 --> 2133.44
give an answer to a question like that

2130.88 --> 2136.59
but the answer would always be no there

2133.44 --> 2139.7400000000002
is only one material plane and it's

2136.59 --> 2142.79
pretty fascinating now that I'm here

2139.74 --> 2146.1499999999996
probably what is it

2142.79 --> 2146.15
fifteen years later

2147.42 --> 2155.02
and then seeing that weight right that

2152.53 --> 2158.02
answer makes a lot more sense to me and

2155.02 --> 2161.56
it's funny how I asked it in a certain

2158.02 --> 2164.35
way of which I did not even realize the

2161.56 --> 2167.7999999999997
depth of the words that I was using by

2164.35 --> 2172.54
using material plain referencing to the

2167.8 --> 2175.3
D&D use of the words the material plane

2172.54 --> 2178.93
is in the material dimension which

2175.3 --> 2181.32
borders to all the alternative to all

2178.93 --> 2184.5699999999997
the other planes the outer planes the

2181.32 --> 2187.3300000000004
elemental planes and the planes of the

2184.57 --> 2191.56
deities that's how D&D works in the DND

2187.33 --> 2196.48
cosmology I have the book and yeah

2191.56 --> 2204.07
moving on from from using drugs to other

2196.48 --> 2207.73
dimensions it seems but alright from

2204.07 --> 2210.67
everything that I've gathered from

2207.73 --> 2213.64
action from otherworldly sources you

2210.67 --> 2215.53
could say or through spirits on the

2213.64 --> 2218.92
other side there's only one material

2215.53 --> 2221.8300000000004
realm that's what I have gathered and

2218.92 --> 2225.94
that is per default what I accept now

2221.83 --> 2230.31
and at the same time that answer one

2225.94 --> 2235.84
material plane opens all kinds of doors

2230.31 --> 2237.94
because how big is this plane if there's

2235.84 --> 2242.53
only one no that seems I've said if

2237.94 --> 2246.85
you're gonna declare everything we know

2242.53 --> 2251.92
that one plane but it does it reach only

2246.85 --> 2255.43
thus far as we think or does it reach

2251.92 --> 2259.6
very far it's just one plane it's just

2255.43 --> 2261.72
it could just be incredibly big we don't

2259.6 --> 2261.72
know

2264.86 --> 2272.07
but I had answers from the other side as

2268.22 --> 2275.3399999999997
a non flat earther and technically in

2272.07 --> 2281.4500000000003
retrospect I was are currently asking

2275.34 --> 2286.9500000000003
questions where my actual consciousness

2281.45 --> 2289.9199999999996
was not awake he did not know I did not

2286.95 --> 2291.7799999999997
know about Flat Earth I've probably seen

2289.92 --> 2296.28
it before I could not accept it I was

2291.78 --> 2299.01
still resolving the memories of the

2296.28 --> 2301.0800000000004
punishment basically that I underwent in

2299.01 --> 2302.46
conjunction with learning about that

2301.08 --> 2304.47
that's what they did that's what

2302.46 --> 2306.78
happened during my dark world visions a

2304.47 --> 2312.06
lot and before that in the real world

2306.78 --> 2315.7200000000003
wouldn't explain me things so my

2312.06 --> 2319.95
consciousness didn't really understand

2315.72 --> 2322.2
how deep the answers could reach to the

2319.95 --> 2323.8799999999997
question that I had it's just I just saw

2322.2 --> 2327.0899999999997
the opening of the question but I did

2323.88 --> 2329.13
feel that there was so much more to it

2327.09 --> 2331.8900000000003
that I would later start to understand

2329.13 --> 2335.13
just like when I originally designed

2331.89 --> 2338.52
this symbol and I knew it back that you

2335.13 --> 2342.4500000000003
know what I don't think I'm gonna share

2338.52 --> 2346.23
it but I do have it recorded on CD that

2342.45 --> 2348.99
actual medium conversation but there's

2346.23 --> 2350.34
also some very personal relation whining

2348.99 --> 2353.45
about a relation back then that I

2350.34 --> 2356.55
absolutely don't want to share in public

2353.45 --> 2360.66
but that question was in there its own

2356.55 --> 2365.73
record maybe I might take that fragment

2360.66 --> 2367.1099999999997
out and share it I might have to ask the

2365.73 --> 2370.47
guy permission to do that

2367.11 --> 2372.9900000000002
what who knows oh maybe I'll share that

2370.47 --> 2374.0899999999997
at some point

2372.99 --> 2377.3599999999997
[Music]

2374.09 --> 2381.44
but now yeah even as my mind didn't

2377.36 --> 2385.3700000000003
realize how everything would eventually

2381.44 --> 2389.86
turn out to be the question was aimed

2385.37 --> 2392.81
proper because even without knowing and

2389.86 --> 2395.1800000000003
even being partially blinded probably on

2392.81 --> 2399.13
purpose because I still wanted my

2395.18 --> 2402.29
naivety I wanted it back as it were I

2399.13 --> 2404.36
asked the question that had the right

2402.29 --> 2406.85
frequency and that I felt would go

2404.36 --> 2409.46
extremely far even though the answer

2406.85 --> 2410.5699999999997
that I would be getting barely meant

2409.46 --> 2414.34
anything to me

2410.57 --> 2418.28
I actually miss contextualize it because

2414.34 --> 2421.31
my conscious feeling in of what I was

2418.28 --> 2425.03
asking was much more limited than the

2421.31 --> 2431.42
overall understanding that I have now so

2425.03 --> 2433.6400000000003
see how amazing one thing in the past

2431.42 --> 2436.54
can be you're asking a question with a

2433.64 --> 2439.97
pretty basic mindset but with very good

2436.54 --> 2443.33
intuition with just a sense and now

2439.97 --> 2446.9599999999996
later I understand the depth of the

2443.33 --> 2449.92
question I asked and the depth of the

2446.96 --> 2449.92
answer I got

2454.53 --> 2462.1800000000003
all right but look this is not like oh

2457.53 --> 2465.15
we rule bully now this is a special guy

2462.18 --> 2469.8799999999997
that does private sessions still does it

2465.15 --> 2475.11
I think and this was 15 years ago

2469.88 --> 2481.71
okay with a whole other mindset and it's

2475.11 --> 2483.81
just I've experienced I even conversed

2481.71 --> 2489.26
it with that medium with the spirit of

2483.81 --> 2492.6
that medium that spirits technically

2489.26 --> 2502.8300000000004
potentially know everything potentially

2492.6 --> 2508.37
but they can only they can't insert new

2502.83 --> 2513.7799999999997
ideas they can only answer questions

2508.37 --> 2516.27
properly or give some general standard

2513.78 --> 2518.84
advice that doesn't reach that deep if

2516.27 --> 2521.64
there's eventually no ground to go to

2518.84 --> 2525.03
but I figured out how they were I lit

2521.64 --> 2527.18
like I was the guy you know that went to

2525.03 --> 2530.46
the guy and he's a medium and I was like

2527.18 --> 2533.04
yeah with all respect and you know I'm

2530.46 --> 2535.62
I'm good for it I kind of want to study

2533.04 --> 2537.63
the spirit if that's okay with him I

2535.62 --> 2539.79
kind of want to see what's going on what

2537.63 --> 2543.33
it is and how it is separate from your

2539.79 --> 2545.52
consciousness what that is study how it

2543.33 --> 2548.58
works I did the same thing with well

2545.52 --> 2551.7599999999998
with the very special entity in my

2548.58 --> 2554.19
experience before that because I'm like

2551.76 --> 2556.44
I'm just fascinating to me I approach it

2554.19 --> 2562.02
I guess like a scientist I just really

2556.44 --> 2564.63
want to figure out what that is also

2562.02 --> 2568.47
using my senses I mean I use my senses

2564.63 --> 2571.53
just as I would figure out somebody's

2568.47 --> 2574.74
motive or where they're going I do the

2571.53 --> 2578.28
same thing to the medium spirits it's

2574.74 --> 2580.1699999999996
palpable and they are different and

2578.28 --> 2584.55
that's the weird thing I can only say

2580.17 --> 2586.44
that like that entity that came into

2584.55 --> 2588.0
them and with a different voice they

2586.44 --> 2589.83
were kind of weird how that

2588.0 --> 2593.28
sounds it almost makes it sound a little

2589.83 --> 2598.92
bit fake unnecessarily but you can ask I

2593.28 --> 2603.0600000000004
asked super straight questions heavy

2598.92 --> 2606.81
questions and it would just answer and

2603.06 --> 2608.37
and the frequency was definitely not off

2606.81 --> 2617.58
the of that guy

2608.37 --> 2619.17
it was another entity and the same thing

2617.58 --> 2622.83
by the way with the spirit and the other

2619.17 --> 2624.63
person and then there's the other way

2622.83 --> 2629.0299999999997
effect and that is how much do you

2624.63 --> 2632.6400000000003
actually trust the medium because

2629.03 --> 2634.5600000000004
sometimes spirit that with typical

2632.64 --> 2636.6299999999997
mediums that where spirits arrive

2634.56 --> 2640.59
sometimes random or sometimes always the

2636.63 --> 2643.53
same it can get very very strongly cold

2640.59 --> 2645.69
and it will just take over and the

2643.53 --> 2648.7200000000003
medium barely has any control but over

2645.69 --> 2651.03
the long run that enthusiastic strength

2648.72 --> 2654.6
that called the spirit in may lessen and

2651.03 --> 2659.61
then the medium can if they are sneaky

2654.6 --> 2662.58
enough and some are unfortunately out

2659.61 --> 2666.03
there I recognize it I some mediums have

2662.58 --> 2670.5299999999997
tried to trick me that way they can then

2666.03 --> 2674.4
just start acting and basically claiming

2670.53 --> 2676.4100000000003
things and if you are just still in the

2674.4 --> 2684.6
dream of amazement that it all happens

2676.41 --> 2687.06
you may fall for that it's very sad but

2684.6 --> 2690.42
yeah you've looked once that starts to

2687.06 --> 2692.46
happen you'll figure it out sooner or

2690.42 --> 2695.25
later because if you fall for that kind

2692.46 --> 2698.46
of setup and you become a is a cash cow

2695.25 --> 2699.9
to a medium in that way your family or

2698.46 --> 2702.09
your friends or whatever they're gonna

2699.9 --> 2707.9300000000003
notice oh yeah they're gonna try to stop

2702.09 --> 2707.9300000000003
you and then it it is sensible

2711.0 --> 2716.76
anyway this proof went way off track

2713.61 --> 2718.83
into mediums but I did do a lot of

2716.76 --> 2721.59
investigating into mediums and in the

2718.83 --> 2723.7799999999997
spiritual realm very much so and they

2721.59 --> 2726.7200000000003
the dark world experience well can't get

2723.78 --> 2730.5
any more deep than that extra

2726.72 --> 2733.3999999999996
dimensional stuff and it's been a

2730.5 --> 2737.58
genuine study I feel almost like a

2733.4 --> 2739.71
dimensional Explorer sometimes it's

2737.58 --> 2742.17
weird because that's actually a prestige

2739.71 --> 2744.93
class in D&D it feels very much like I

2742.17 --> 2747.1800000000003
fall into that category or I did did

2744.93 --> 2751.41
fall into that category I'm now aiming

2747.18 --> 2756.12
it in a in another way I have another

2751.41 --> 2759.2999999999997
focus but still that's a long-term

2756.12 --> 2764.42
project that I'll be that I'll have

2759.3 --> 2764.42
insights on for the rest of my life I

2765.92 --> 2772.59
will be able to help people explain what

2769.44 --> 2774.39
what dreams are and also tell the

2772.59 --> 2780.6000000000004
difference between different types of

2774.39 --> 2783.9
dreams and I yeah I work with that like

2780.6 --> 2787.17
a biologist would work with all the

2783.9 --> 2793.92
details they know about their works only

2787.17 --> 2796.6800000000003
I am purely self-taught because early on

2793.92 --> 2800.4900000000002
I was trying to assimilate this type of

2796.68 --> 2803.5699999999997
information from other books and just

2800.49 --> 2809.31
the way everybody approached it was also

2803.57 --> 2812.46
clumsy or really Oh a PDP and it sucked

2809.31 --> 2816.7799999999997
I just didn't like any type of approach

2812.46 --> 2820.68
from any type of which person or medium

2816.78 --> 2823.8
or alternative psychologists no I'd know

2820.68 --> 2828.12
so I just said screw that I'm gonna

2823.8 --> 2831.1800000000003
build one from scratch and that started

2828.12 --> 2836.58
when I was 16 that's when that started

2831.18 --> 2838.5899999999997
that also when I first had some very

2836.58 --> 2842.4
heavy experiences just using cannabis

2838.59 --> 2843.96
and just two years later I figured out

2842.4 --> 2847.53
that

2843.96 --> 2849.84
I made a connection between my spiritual

2847.53 --> 2853.05
personal experiences and the physical

2849.84 --> 2855.63
world by discovering magnetization the

2853.05 --> 2858.3300000000004
ability to heal and and sense things

2855.63 --> 2863.07
over distance without touching and that

2858.33 --> 2865.11
really made it more real to me and then

2863.07 --> 2867.6600000000003
the path continued it's just my

2865.11 --> 2873.03
scientific exploration and trying to map

2867.66 --> 2877.74
out spiritual abilities dreams dream

2873.03 --> 2881.9100000000003
realms and other dimensions and entities

2877.74 --> 2884.3999999999996
there within and at the same time also

2881.91 --> 2888.06
creation and the nature of of that

2884.4 --> 2889.9500000000003
creation and and the the over power of

2888.06 --> 2901.25
God and yeah

2889.95 --> 2904.2
all of it huh

2901.25 --> 2907.85
no more colored I don't think so

2904.2 --> 2910.83
but if enough people believe something

2907.85 --> 2913.83
then within that belief they share a

2910.83 --> 2915.9
connection because if people believe in

2913.83 --> 2918.59
the same way visualize things in the

2915.9 --> 2922.14
same way then as they communicate

2918.59 --> 2926.54
simultaneously these visualizations will

2922.14 --> 2929.6099999999997
be triggered and then that has a very

2926.54 --> 2931.2
interesting side effect on communicating

2929.61 --> 2934.26
consciousness because you'll then

2931.2 --> 2937.9199999999996
interface by this shared visualization

2934.26 --> 2942.36
the shared belief so it doesn't make it

2937.92 --> 2947.64
real but it does enable much almost like

2942.36 --> 2950.31
it helps you tap into a holographic

2947.64 --> 2957.3599999999997
realm that you can share it's what I've

2950.31 --> 2959.34
been doing here that's what I do but it

2957.36 --> 2962.3700000000003
doesn't really make something real you

2959.34 --> 2967.59
can establish things with it

2962.37 --> 2969.93
so you could potentially get it for

2967.59 --> 2971.9700000000003
example a focus visualization to make a

2969.93 --> 2973.83
contact or there's all kinds of things

2971.97 --> 2977.31
you can achieve with that if you focus

2973.83 --> 2977.88
properly enough but if you're gonna

2977.31 --> 2981.39
start

2977.88 --> 2983.88
reading it almost like like oh yeah I'm

2981.39 --> 2986.7599999999998
just gonna fill this up with habits and

2983.88 --> 2989.9
tricks and just be working on it all day

2986.76 --> 2992.4900000000002
that's very risky because then you are

2989.9 --> 2994.8
burdening the overall energies in

2992.49 --> 2996.8999999999996
yourself more and that will make you

2994.8 --> 3000.26
vulnerable especially for entities that

2996.9 --> 3002.69
love to try to take over and use

3000.26 --> 3007.13
somebody that has so many energy skills

3002.69 --> 3010.9700000000003
that they can then basically steal by

3007.13 --> 3016.9700000000003
taking the person over so it's risky

3010.97 --> 3020.0
that's the risk of being a magician the

3016.97 --> 3023.72
more viable your skills and the the more

3020.0 --> 3025.55
heavy burdens the more tempting for the

3023.72 --> 3027.6699999999996
dark entities to try and take you over

3025.55 --> 3032.78
because they love that [ __ ]

3027.67 --> 3035.56
they love real abilities that's why they

3032.78 --> 3035.5600000000004
wanted me so much

3048.16 --> 3056.25
hmm Wow I can't believe I've just been

3050.71 --> 3056.25
talking for 50 minutes straight

3067.41 --> 3073.319
ah Craig Meister asks to join the show

3070.769 --> 3075.7099999999996
but I didn't see it it's a bit late for

3073.319 --> 3075.71
that now

3097.88 --> 3111.11
ah so yeah mapping all these things

3107.15 --> 3115.4300000000003
inside and I freely share it and that's

3111.11 --> 3118.79
weird thing because a lot of people that

3115.43 --> 3120.89
have fast insight tend to keep it for

3118.79 --> 3124.13
themselves as much as possible but at

3120.89 --> 3126.5
the same time it is also what you get

3124.13 --> 3129.13
confronted with when you really start to

3126.5 --> 3132.98
delve in because the entities will

3129.13 --> 3136.1800000000003
approach you they always do that they

3132.98 --> 3139.75
always come after you they try it

3136.18 --> 3142.43
especially if you're very strong and

3139.75 --> 3145.94
there's a lot of things you kind of

3142.43 --> 3149.87
learn by accident that you definitely

3145.94 --> 3154.82
don't want to share with the world you

3149.87 --> 3161.0499999999997
get a lot of bad news or just even

3154.82 --> 3166.34
sometimes evil ideas that you just like

3161.05 --> 3168.4100000000003
you would like to basically help prevent

3166.34 --> 3170.84
something like that from happening but

3168.41 --> 3174.79
sometimes these things that they show

3170.84 --> 3178.46
you are just so disgusting or evil it's

3174.79 --> 3182.45
purely more meant to break you and just

3178.46 --> 3186.92
to share it is you don't know what that

3182.45 --> 3189.6699999999996
does it's just bad don't perpetuate bad

3186.92 --> 3189.67
frequencies

3197.359 --> 3206.25
right so yeah be careful with this stuff

3203.46 --> 3207.9900000000002
just as in the real world there's just

3206.25 --> 3210.15
annoying people getting in your way or

3207.99 --> 3212.3689999999997
nasty people that try to corrupt you and

3210.15 --> 3215.25
all that [ __ ] for somebody that is

3212.369 --> 3217.83
sensitive and that is really trying to

3215.25 --> 3219.54
develop their mental skill like there

3217.83 --> 3223.41
are spiritual skills and all that

3219.54 --> 3227.369
discover all of that they face similar

3223.41 --> 3230.3999999999996
level levels of punishment you can't

3227.369 --> 3233.4900000000002
escape it whether you do it in the

3230.4 --> 3235.2000000000003
physical world you're gonna get it or if

3233.49 --> 3240.8999999999996
you do it in the spiritual world you're

3235.2 --> 3243.33
gonna get it so just a warning it's not

3240.9 --> 3245.76
a free ticket okay it's not like oh my

3243.33 --> 3249.0
god I can finally escape all that [ __ ]

3245.76 --> 3254.8100000000004
in the material world let's dive in well

3249.0 --> 3258.06
if you do that you'll end up like [ __ ]

3254.81 --> 3262.109
that's exactly what I didn't want that's

3258.06 --> 3266.43
why your end up when you do that gotta

3262.109 --> 3269.85
be very careful it's a careful

3266.43 --> 3273.6
exploration it take it small steps like

3269.85 --> 3275.91
a kid like a kid just learning to to

3273.6 --> 3278.15
walk and all that if they rush it

3275.91 --> 3280.2599999999998
they'll fall over and they'll bump

3278.15 --> 3282.9900000000002
they'll bump their heads and if you're

3280.26 --> 3285.3900000000003
unlucky they'll bump it into so bad

3282.99 --> 3288.89
they'll get wounded that [ __ ] well the

3285.39 --> 3291.23
same goes when you try to explore

3288.89 --> 3295.0499999999997
spiritual skills and making connections

3291.23 --> 3300.9
through there and all that it's it's

3295.05 --> 3306.27
just as dangerous so it's not a game in

3300.9 --> 3309.6800000000003
my opinion I hope I've hope I brought

3306.27 --> 3309.68
that across plenty

3309.84 --> 3317.86
and just like with with drugs it's not

3313.18 --> 3320.77
really a game if you treat it like a

3317.86 --> 3324.67
game then it will eventually bite you in

3320.77 --> 3326.5
the ass one way or the other you got it

3324.67 --> 3329.71
it's better to take it serious and you

3326.5 --> 3332.62
can take it as a test it's an

3329.71 --> 3336.01
opportunity to try to improve yourself

3332.62 --> 3341.83
if you just treat it like a game whether

3336.01 --> 3347.38
it's drugs or yeah doing things with the

3341.83 --> 3356.2599999999998
ethereal in the spiritual realm it all

3347.38 --> 3359.6400000000003
results in the same things really anyway

3356.26 --> 3362.59
I think I'm gonna round out the show I

3359.64 --> 3370.15
can't say heaven another subject after

3362.59 --> 3374.23
this let this all sink in and watch back

3370.15 --> 3379.78
and see like okay what did I say this

3374.23 --> 3384.52
time I remember musty but it was a lot

3379.78 --> 3387.3700000000003
of digging back in the past it was so

3384.52 --> 3390.43
weird because now I know I showed just

3387.37 --> 3392.95
bits and pieces from a certain angle top

3390.43 --> 3395.74
down as I was creative and using all

3392.95 --> 3397.5699999999997
these things pretty close by it my

3395.74 --> 3399.0699999999997
consciousness was closed off because at

3397.57 --> 3403.7200000000003
the same time there was a lot that I

3399.07 --> 3407.02
just couldn't deal with and I shared

3403.72 --> 3408.91
that like yeah back over then I had no

3407.02 --> 3411.28
idea what I was doing I was kind of

3408.91 --> 3413.85
stupid I was kind of naive and all that

3411.28 --> 3417.88
was true but at that time I could not

3413.85 --> 3420.16
accept that that realization was

3417.88 --> 3423.46
basically compartmentalized out of sight

3420.16 --> 3426.46
for me and now I'm showing and now today

3423.46 --> 3428.68
I showed you bits and pieces from how

3426.46 --> 3433.75
the experience was actually like from a

3428.68 --> 3436.81
personified perspective more because

3433.75 --> 3438.7
there there were yeah with many people's

3436.81 --> 3441.85
lives if they come to the realization

3438.7 --> 3442.48
there is usually just many angles to the

3441.85 --> 3445.72
experi

3442.48 --> 3448.2400000000002
that they go through and they usually

3445.72 --> 3450.49
start out just being able to see it from

3448.24 --> 3452.5899999999997
one perspective and not even being

3450.49 --> 3455.83
allowed by their inner selves or they're

3452.59 --> 3458.7400000000002
eager to in visualize it in another way

3455.83 --> 3460.93
what's going on and then later on they

3458.74 --> 3463.45
do start to see those other sides also

3460.93 --> 3465.97
and it just shows that life is much more

3463.45 --> 3469.6
complicated than that consciousness can

3465.97 --> 3472.47
make out sometimes and that it the real

3469.6 --> 3478.99
insight comes afterwards that's wisdom

3472.47 --> 3481.99
literally literally and figuratively so

3478.99 --> 3485.7099999999996
