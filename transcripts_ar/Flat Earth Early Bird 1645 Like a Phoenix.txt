streams

148.56 --> 152.94
very intense

150.66 --> 155.35999999999999
a lot of development since the last time

152.94 --> 155.35999999999999
I left

here

156.78 --> 160.68

166.14 --> 172.379
so let's see what happens anyway

170.04 --> 175.07999999999998
weather today is

172.379 --> 178.62
I don't know

175.08 --> 180.66000000000003
it it only just warmed up a bit

178.62 --> 183.78
some some

180.66 --> 185.819
but it's been very cloudy and and a bit

183.78 --> 189.36
rainy too

185.819 --> 192.0
not very hard rain but just like rain

189.36 --> 195.18
throughout the evening and night

192.0 --> 197.519

195.18 --> 201.0
and to be fair the green actually does

197.519 --> 203.54
look the grass does look Greener now

201.0 --> 203.54
so

204.42 --> 206.89999999999998
right

207.36 --> 211.64000000000001
plants are doing great

220.819 --> 226.14

223.14 --> 228.95899999999997
grass mower going around again

226.14 --> 231.55999999999997

228.959 --> 231.56

it's been very hot summer overall but

262.139 --> 266.639
it's been

263.759 --> 269.759
a little bit

266.639 --> 272.699
less sunny and a bit of rain since

269.759 --> 274.74
yesterday but that's great because it

272.699 --> 277.46000000000004
we've had a lot of sunny days that are

274.74 --> 277.46000000000004

288.3 --> 291.91900000000004

292.139 --> 296.72
you can't exactly call that cold either

297.72 --> 302.47900000000004
according to this it will warm up a bit

300.24 --> 302.479
more

311.28 --> 315.84
it seems like it's gonna kind of be that

314.46 --> 319.25899999999996
type of weather

315.84 --> 320.52
better clouds sometimes rain but also

319.259 --> 322.139

444.479 --> 448.31899999999996
impossible I literally unblocked

446.46 --> 453.73999999999995
everybody

448.319 --> 453.74
's your issue it's not mine I

461.77 --> 469.44
[Music]

[Applause]

486.78 --> 491.75899999999996
feels good to be back yeah

489.419 --> 493.56
well I kind of liked streaming on our

491.759 --> 496.34000000000003
winning bear

493.56 --> 496.34
I liked it

497.0 --> 500.17
[Music]

500.52 --> 507.96
so yeah I don't know

504.78 --> 507.96
[Music]

511.56 --> 516.779
I mean I'll be happy when everybody is

514.2 --> 519.4190000000001
just in here again and

516.779 --> 523.08
and I'll notice some kind of advantage

519.419 --> 525.24
of having a bigger subscriber Channel

523.08 --> 527.22
so

525.24 --> 529.019
but I mean Our Winning bear was just

527.22 --> 533.839
doing great

529.019 --> 533.839
it was absolutely fine

551.88 --> 558.14
but I am in the sense glad that I've

554.76 --> 561.0
kind of like got through this phase and

558.14 --> 562.4399999999999
unscathed and all that that just my main

561.0 --> 566.779
account is

562.44 --> 566.7790000000001
just hair and strike free

567.839 --> 571.0400000000001
I'm glad about that

578.459 --> 580.9399999999999
all right

610.56 --> 615.0
but yeah

612.779 --> 617.3
I don't know I I've not slept super

615.0 --> 617.3
great

617.519 --> 620.66
so it's yeah

620.88 --> 626.16
got some things that are like

623.64 --> 628.019
leaning on my mind right now just

626.16 --> 630.0
unpleasant things

628.019 --> 632.22
I looked into something and I'm kind of

630.0 --> 635.04
sorry I did and I'm not even gonna talk

632.22 --> 637.62
about what it is but it's like yeah

635.04 --> 639.3
got some [ __ ] I'm trying to get out of

637.62 --> 641.64
my soul

639.3 --> 643.68
and it's like [ __ ] tied up with the

641.64 --> 646.5
Dark World Visions again it's like I

643.68 --> 648.7199999999999
basically just discovered something that

646.5 --> 652.16
I remember from first person perspective

648.72 --> 652.1600000000001
which I really wish I didn't

664.14 --> 670.25
[Music]

676.2 --> 680.7
100

678.26 --> 683.88
hundred hundred

680.7 --> 685.62
yes this silly new button thing

683.88 --> 687.48
it's really weird

685.62 --> 690.48
I'd prefer you just

687.48 --> 692.7
push the rogans up instead

690.48 --> 695.76
it's very distracting although it does

692.7 --> 698.6
show that there is some somebody seeing

695.76 --> 698.6
the chat at least

700.92 --> 704.3
have a great day thanks

724.26 --> 728.06
right so yeah guys

728.519 --> 733.14
don't really have something inside that

731.04 --> 736.1999999999999
I could like talk about

733.14 --> 738.779
we're gonna have to like cut the dark

736.2 --> 740.5790000000001
world's dream and stuff a bit short

738.779 --> 742.5
because they basically stumble into

740.579 --> 743.88
something and I got a bit in nightmares

742.5 --> 746.76
right now

743.88 --> 748.56
so but

746.76 --> 751.5
whatever I can talk about whatever

748.56 --> 753.42
whatever you guys bring up

751.5 --> 755.1
maybe we should talk about Flat Earth I

753.42 --> 757.5
mean I can talk about anything flat

755.1 --> 759.72
earth related unless it's like people

757.5 --> 763.459
Behavior or something

759.72 --> 763.4590000000001
without any kind of

763.62 --> 768.3
feelings that get in the way so that

765.72 --> 770.9590000000001
that that would be easy

768.3 --> 770.959
for me

776.279 --> 780.32
Dell is still added out there

785.12 --> 788.839
being ridiculous

793.32 --> 799.9200000000001
fed yesterday was good

797.22 --> 803.3000000000001
although I was out for groceries like

799.92 --> 803.3
most of the live show

805.079 --> 809.9399999999999
and yeah and I have to show they got

807.12 --> 812.76
really Rowdy like it got a bit annoying

809.94 --> 816.139
though like I wasn't being rompussy but

812.76 --> 816.139
like everybody got so

816.36 --> 819.74
rumpacy with each other

821.339 --> 827.1800000000001
I don't know why it was just like that

824.22 --> 827.1800000000001
kind of a day I guess

828.899 --> 831.899
[ __ ]

838.5 --> 843.959
okay I would really prefer that people

841.079 --> 848.16
actually say something more than just

843.959 --> 851.26
one freaking sentence in my chat

848.16 --> 854.409
in these first 15 minutes guys

851.26 --> 854.409
[Music]

854.82 --> 859.9200000000001
I mean saying hello in the chat is not

856.98 --> 862.26
like clocking in like it's the only

859.92 --> 864.06
thing you're supposed to say would be

862.26 --> 867.5
great if there would be actually a feel

864.06 --> 867.5
of people being around

867.839 --> 871.339
having a conversation

871.62 --> 876.839
that would be great I'm almost missing

874.079 --> 879.3
my old account because yeah I had

876.839 --> 881.639
several days in a row where I started up

879.3 --> 884.459
right on time and there's like 20

881.639 --> 886.98
message within one minute

884.459 --> 888.899
now that's great

886.98 --> 891.72
Within

888.899 --> 893.339
five minutes that would be great to see

891.72 --> 896.639
that again I want to see that again

893.339 --> 900.0600000000001
right now get stop what you're doing

896.639 --> 902.22
stop digging in your garden stop [ __ ]

900.06 --> 904.92
around with your coffee machine walk to

902.22 --> 908.5400000000001
your keyboard and type something in the

904.92 --> 912.38
early bird chat right now

908.54 --> 912.38
right [ __ ] now

920.94 --> 925.8000000000001
[Music]

923.279 --> 928.56
yes

925.8 --> 931.399
looking for me in the channel in YouTube

928.56 --> 931.399
live streams

931.68 --> 935.8389999999999
looking for me Channel

938.1 --> 943.339
oh you're like General searching okay

946.62 --> 950.76
well that's not gonna work Richard G

948.899 --> 952.92
because this account has not been live

950.76 --> 956.519
for like months

952.92 --> 958.5
so technically this is a downgrade

956.519 --> 961.019
for the time being because this thing

958.5 --> 962.399
has not been running for a while the

961.019 --> 964.62
other one is like

962.399 --> 966.839
Peak expectancy

964.62 --> 968.519
so yeah in that sense it almost kind of

966.839 --> 970.0790000000001
sucks going back to my old Channel

968.519 --> 972.72
because

970.079 --> 975.4799999999999
I don't have that connection it's just

972.72 --> 977.839
something that stops suddenly going

975.48 --> 977.839
again

978.36 --> 986.1
so I would really prefer if anybody that

982.139 --> 990.9590000000001
actually arrives here gets busy

986.1 --> 993.4200000000001
I mean it don't [ __ ] sit back

990.959 --> 995.0999999999999
I want you active in my chat I want you

993.42 --> 997.74
sharing

995.1 --> 999.779
because otherwise this is going to be a

997.74 --> 1001.5790000000001
downgrade

999.779 --> 1004.54
be active

1001.579 --> 1004.54
right now

1005.6 --> 1010.0400000000001
say something in the chat Richard G

1008.06 --> 1012.1389999999999
you're doing great anybody else out

1010.04 --> 1017.079
there would be great if you said more

1012.139 --> 1017.0790000000001
than one [ __ ] sentence in my chat

1018.38 --> 1020.62
foreign

1049.78 --> 1052.93
[Music]

1054.919 --> 1058.2990000000002
message never seen

1059.179 --> 1066.2
right so could anybody else that is not

1062.72 --> 1072.039
a troll please speak up in my chat you

1066.2 --> 1072.039
said hello now say something again yeah

1072.74 --> 1075.799
I mean if that's the way you're gonna be

1074.72 --> 1078.8600000000001
guys

1075.799 --> 1080.96
I'm gonna like make rules here

1078.86 --> 1084.5
yeah

1080.96 --> 1088.419
just saying hello one [ __ ] time in my

1084.5 --> 1088.419
chat is not participation

1089.059 --> 1092.059
foreign

1096.4 --> 1101.6000000000001
yeah I don't mind I was expecting that I

1099.799 --> 1102.74
mean I'm gonna be chain Banning trolls

1101.6 --> 1105.02
that's fine

1102.74 --> 1108.14
but that's not what I care I care about

1105.02 --> 1110.4189999999999
the people actually getting active in my

1108.14 --> 1113.3600000000001
chat like you are you're the only person

1110.419 --> 1115.4
that's actually here being active right

1113.36 --> 1117.86
now Richard G I really appreciate that

1115.4 --> 1120.14
and I'm really kind of pissed off at

1117.86 --> 1121.8799999999999
these other people I've been hanging

1120.14 --> 1124.3400000000001
around

1121.88 --> 1129.46
for months with my channel on a daily

1124.34 --> 1129.4599999999998
basis that say hello one [ __ ] time

1129.74 --> 1133.179
and then they just leave

1133.4 --> 1137.38
I find that unacceptable

1148.88 --> 1153.16
yeah that that does not make a live

1150.919 --> 1153.16
stream

1153.5 --> 1158.48
I mean at this point when it looks like

1155.78 --> 1160.16
this it makes me think like yeah maybe I

1158.48 --> 1162.98
just shouldn't do live streams anymore

1160.16 --> 1165.94
maybe I should just pre-record [ __ ] and

1162.98 --> 1165.94
then I can edit it

1166.7 --> 1171.5
it could do all kinds of [ __ ]

1169.52 --> 1176.299
and then just like

1171.5 --> 1178.4
don't address anybody anymore alive

1176.299 --> 1181.1
because they're like saying hello one

1809.36 --> 1811.779
in

1812.299 --> 1817.82
but yeah good to have you back

1815.48 --> 1818.96
I have been live streaming on my other

1817.82 --> 1821.98
account

1818.96 --> 1821.98
all this time

1831.67 --> 1834.8390000000002
[Music]

1842.36 --> 1849.039
I mean I did leave certain messages in

1846.44 --> 1849.039
the comments

1850.52 --> 1857.08
you could have found that out

1853.7 --> 1857.0800000000002
that that is the case

1858.38 --> 1862.1200000000001
stopped even looking why

1866.539 --> 1870.52
why did you stop looking for me

1875.779 --> 1883.22
I mean if somebody that has an everyday

1879.08 --> 1885.86
show suddenly stops streaming

1883.22 --> 1888.02
well what do you do then you look in the

1885.86 --> 1890.4189999999999
comment section

1888.02 --> 1893.299
or the description box or something of

1890.419 --> 1895.7
the last stream right

1893.299 --> 1899.0
because you'll find a message there

1895.7 --> 1901.3400000000001
communication about what's going on why

1899.0 --> 1905.14
this is not why there are no new live

1901.34 --> 1905.1399999999999
streams right logic

1905.24 --> 1910.179
you thought I was gone permanently oh

1907.94 --> 1910.179
really

1910.46 --> 1917.419
so you you didn't check

1914.72 --> 1918.98
you're just like oh no of course like

1917.419 --> 1921.5590000000002
one day to the oh yes just gone

1918.98 --> 1924.32
permanently out what you're not gonna

1921.559 --> 1926.899
look for an answer

1924.32 --> 1929.26
what

1926.899 --> 1929.26
right

1934.29 --> 1937.3899999999999
[Music]

1938.899 --> 1942.279
few messages

1942.98 --> 1947.539
uh

1944.179 --> 1949.76
uh no no there's plenty of messages

1947.539 --> 1951.86
I mean in my last stream here is chock

1949.76 --> 1954.74
full with comments

1951.86 --> 1957.02
and I kept moderating them I have

1954.74 --> 1959.6200000000001
actually kept track of that during these

1957.02 --> 1959.62
three months

1964.64 --> 1970.6000000000001
and I responded to like almost every

1967.52 --> 1970.6
chat tree there

1979.059 --> 1985.52
right but I mean technically maybe I am

1983.48 --> 1988.52
to blame because I could have at some

1985.52 --> 1991.82
point potentially done like a little

1988.52 --> 1994.34
video where like oh hi I'm Arwen oh you

1991.82 --> 1996.26
might be wondering where where I've been

1994.34 --> 1999.1399999999999
all this time yeah I'm streaming on my

1996.26 --> 2001.539
backup account here's the link go there

1999.14 --> 2005.64
now and subscribe I still do daily live

2001.539 --> 2005.64
shows I could have done that

2009.58 --> 2016.24
for people that are like really really

2013.72 --> 2018.659
easy to give up on trying to find out

2016.24 --> 2018.659
what happened

2027.34 --> 2030.34
hey Jeff gassad yeah good to have you

2029.62 --> 2032.32
back

2030.34 --> 2034.48
I've been streaming on my backup account

2032.32 --> 2037.62
all this time though so I don't know why

2034.48 --> 2037.6200000000001
you never showed up there

2053.74 --> 2057.22
right anyway

2055.72 --> 2061.1389999999997
I am back

2057.22 --> 2063.6389999999997
first part of the show is a bit

2061.139 --> 2066.839
non-content related hey blue pill

2063.639 --> 2066.839
Devolution good to see you

2069.639 --> 2074.2000000000003
right but I mean I'm not exactly like

2072.099 --> 2076.8990000000003
resonating on the inside since I haven't

2074.2 --> 2079.7999999999997
got like terrible [ __ ] to like try to

2076.899 --> 2079.7999999999997
forget about

2080.8 --> 2083.639
uh

2084.159 --> 2090.339
so I'm either looking for a lead some

2087.94 --> 2091.839
input about something to talk about from

2090.339 --> 2095.379
one of you guys

2091.839 --> 2098.56
or just kind of hang around and just

2095.379 --> 2100.2999999999997
just make this view like the the entry

2098.56 --> 2102.099
show like oh welcome back welcome

2100.3 --> 2103.78
everybody get inside everybody get

2102.099 --> 2106.06
inside

2103.78 --> 2108.7000000000003
I feel like two hours with that with oh

2106.06 --> 2110.56
yeah hey welcome back yeah hey oh you're

2108.7 --> 2113.0789999999997
live again yeah yeah I've been live all

2110.56 --> 2116.74
this time yeah saying that another 20

2113.079 --> 2118.54
times that's fine I can do that too

2116.74 --> 2121.4399999999996
it's not gonna make much of a show to

2118.54 --> 2121.44
watch though but

2121.599 --> 2126.52
can do that

2124.02 --> 2128.74
[Music]

2126.52 --> 2132.579
glad to welcome a whole bunch of people

2128.74 --> 2134.74
back although I am surprised why nobody

2132.579 --> 2138.0
ever realized that I'm just live

2134.74 --> 2138.0
streaming on my other account

2142.06 --> 2149.7999999999997
yeah I mean I've got a gigantic project

2145.3 --> 2153.579
going yeah 1600 Plus shows

2149.8 --> 2155.26
I'm not just going to quit one day and

2153.579 --> 2160.26
then you never know

2155.26 --> 2160.26
that would be absolutely [ __ ]

2161.5 --> 2167.52
yeah the only reason that would happen

2164.02 --> 2167.52
is if I suddenly died

2168.16 --> 2173.7999999999997
from non-medical related issues because

2171.64 --> 2176.6189999999997
that's not going to happen

2173.8 --> 2179.079
right so

2176.619 --> 2181.119
otherwise there is absolutely no

2179.079 --> 2184.0600000000004
freaking reason why I would just

2181.119 --> 2185.38
discontinue this long long lasting daily

2184.06 --> 2187.66
project

2185.38 --> 2189.76
like there is no reason like even if all

2187.66 --> 2192.7
my YouTube accounts got deleted all of a

2189.76 --> 2196.599
sudden there's no I would still then

2192.7 --> 2200.3799999999997
make a new one and start streaming again

2196.599 --> 2203.26
yeah it's not gonna stop until there's a

2200.38 --> 2206.56
distinct announcement like this is the

2203.26 --> 2208.48
end this I'm not going to continue the

2206.56 --> 2211.24
early bird show anymore

2208.48 --> 2213.339
like no matter what you say or no matter

2211.24 --> 2215.3799999999997
how much money you're gonna donate to me

2213.339 --> 2217.7799999999997
all of a sudden out of nowhere since I

2215.38 --> 2220.42
needed it all that time like

2217.78 --> 2222.4
if I'm gonna stop streaming you will

2220.42 --> 2225.28
know

2222.4 --> 2227.8
so there is no reason other than

2225.28 --> 2232.32
laziness to assume that oh it just

2227.8 --> 2232.32
stopped no that never happens

2235.859 --> 2243.839
that never happens unless I died and if

2239.74 --> 2243.839
I died you will find out

2245.5 --> 2248.76
pretty sure of that

2271.45 --> 2274.5699999999997
[Music]

2289.87 --> 2293.0299999999997
[Music]

2303.19 --> 2306.5190000000002
[Music]

2322.42 --> 2328.599
my interfield has some other interesting

2324.46 --> 2331.66
videos other than a monkeys which ones

2328.599 --> 2333.76
I mean most of them kind of do tie in

2331.66 --> 2336.3999999999996
with it

2333.76 --> 2337.48
there's been a lot of videos that were

2336.4 --> 2342.54
like

2337.48 --> 2342.54
running up to that big homunculus video

2343.18 --> 2346.3999999999996
[Music]

2358.599 --> 2363.6400000000003
ancient cloning factories

2361.78 --> 2367.9
yeah but that's

2363.64 --> 2370.2999999999997
that is technically homunculus related I

2367.9 --> 2374.38
mean you could argue that cloning

2370.3 --> 2376.0
literally involved homunculus techniques

2374.38 --> 2379.32
in ways

2376.0 --> 2379.32
that's tied in

2381.72 --> 2387.12
[Music]

2392.14 --> 2396.04
right but the ancient cloning video that

2394.78 --> 2399.76
that is like

2396.04 --> 2402.579
that's from years ago I think

2399.76 --> 2405.4
and it simply he simply hadn't

2402.579 --> 2408.42
researched that deeply yet

2405.4 --> 2408.42
at that time

2409.72 --> 2415.72
yeah Cabbage Patch baby films but yeah

2412.359 --> 2419.2599999999998
but that also is probably homunculus

2415.72 --> 2422.2599999999998
relate I mean that all comes together in

2419.26 --> 2424.9
the homunculus video I mean it lit like

2422.26 --> 2427.599
every [ __ ] little thing I've ever

2424.9 --> 2429.94
seen on this channel pretty much all

2427.599 --> 2433.7200000000003
came together in a monkey list video

2429.94 --> 2436.38
like everything it is the Rosetta Stone

2433.72 --> 2436.3799999999997
of his channel

2524.98 --> 2531.88
that are not related but I mean it does

2528.28 --> 2533.8
feel like the homunculus video literally

2531.88 --> 2536.7400000000002
has put everything

2533.8 --> 2538.7200000000003

2648.46 --> 2656.28
the guy was not alone but they his team

2652.96 --> 2656.28
has like literally

2657.099 --> 2662.38
like scanned really old or like took old

2660.64 --> 2665.2
book scans that have never been

2662.38 --> 2667.06
translated and then like used algorithms

2665.2 --> 2670.4199999999996
to translate it

2667.06 --> 2673.54
and that's never been done before I mean

2670.42 --> 2677.56
there's a lot of background work that

2673.54 --> 2681.4

potentially like thousands of hours

2681.4 --> 2684.06
all together

freaking 10 hour video

2836.68 --> 2842.2599999999998

2838.9 --> 2845.8
feedback from my video yesterday

2842.26 --> 2848.1400000000003
because I talked about a lot of things

a lot

2848.14 --> 2853.839

conceptions that I don't really want to

2853.839 --> 2857.319
talk about super elaborate but I'm just

2855.819 --> 2858.579
surprised that there was so little

2857.319 --> 2861.42

2858.579 --> 2861.42
afterward

2872.56 --> 2875.88
just dropping or something

2935.28 --> 2940.96

that I don't have to switch accounts

that was just chaos

at first I thought it was kind of funny

right

3075.48 --> 3079.52
today I'm not super chatty

3084.9 --> 3091.14

3088.92 --> 3095.599
whole bunch of negative [ __ ]

3091.14 --> 3097.859
and horror and I don't want to do that

3095.599 --> 3100.319
in fact I would have preferred to

3097.859 --> 3102.9
basically not do a stream today at all

3100.319 --> 3105.48
and just set it up

3102.9 --> 3109.079
but yeah that's kind of crazy to do when

3105.48 --> 3111.18
I was gonna start go to go back on my

3109.079 --> 3113.76
new channel so it's just this

3111.18 --> 3117.74
unfortunately

3113.76 --> 3117.7400000000002

exactly what somebody is like by their

3225.42 --> 3230.48
name by their YouTube name you could

3227.16 --> 3230.48
just immediately tell

3230.819 --> 3237.079

even though it doesn't really feel super

3285.3 --> 3291.44
great to be back

3287.52 --> 3291.44
because of the super slow start

3293.099 --> 3297.78
which hasn't been happening I mean on my

3295.619 --> 3301.38
other channel it's been like really

3297.78 --> 3303.8390000000004

like start the show immediately people

3306.24 --> 3311.64
run in

3307.559 --> 3313.98
like my intro song hadn't even finished

3311.64 --> 3316.68

3332.339 --> 3337.02
I do not understand how that works

3334.74 --> 3340.2
compared to my other channel I do not

3337.02 --> 3344.7599999999998
understand how that works

3340.2 --> 3347.04
the same person the same show format

3344.76 --> 3350.0400000000004
same time

3368.52 --> 3374.339

3371.24 --> 3377.5789999999997
according to the YouTube there's 31

3374.339 --> 3380.42
watching now at least so

3377.579 --> 3380.42
that's something

3407.48 --> 3413.339
by the way cartel parties here I mean

3411.0 --> 3417.119
nobody's talking about anything so I'll

3413.339 --> 3419.64
just bring up random politics yeah maybe

3417.119 --> 3421.6800000000003
we should just talk about Trump how

3419.64 --> 3424.859
everybody hates and loves Trump maybe

3421.68 --> 3426.319
I'll just talk about anything anything

3424.859 --> 3428.9
at all

3426.319 --> 3431.4
especially the things that you probably

3428.9 --> 3433.859
really don't want to hear about because

3431.4 --> 3436.02
you're bombarded with that [ __ ]

3433.859 --> 3439.44
everywhere and you came to this channel

3436.02 --> 3442.44
specifically to hear something else but

3439.44 --> 3444.0
then you don't [ __ ] say anything

3442.44 --> 3447.66
at all

3444.0 --> 3450.0
leave the chat dead yeah and then I

3447.66 --> 3451.7999999999997
might just talk about those things that

3450.0 --> 3455.04
you probably didn't want to hear

3451.8 --> 3459.119
somebody talk about specifically because

3455.04 --> 3461.819
you don't say anything in my chat

3459.119 --> 3466.04
yeah I'll just bring up [ __ ] politics

3461.819 --> 3466.04
then bet you'll love that

3467.48 --> 3472.7400000000002
right so these cartel politicians in the

3470.579 --> 3475.5

3472.74 --> 3478.7999999999997
they're literally like publicly trying

to suggest to forbid the forum for

Nazi party or something totally

3488.099 --> 3493.1600000000003
absurd

3493.94 --> 3499.68
getting very

3497.339 --> 3502.619
very Nazi like

3499.68 --> 3504.1189999999997
and like it's they're so overt about I

3502.619 --> 3506.2200000000003
mean those people

3504.119 --> 3509.339

3506.22 --> 3512.5989999999997

3836.24 --> 3841.74

3839.52 --> 3843.78
that they can do to distract themselves

3841.74 --> 3846.02
from their outrage

3843.78 --> 3848.059
usually just porn or something

3846.02 --> 3852.299
[Music]

3848.059 --> 3855.119
or drugs or gambling or something stupid

3852.299 --> 3856.819
that distracts them I mean that's the

3855.119 --> 3860.42
point of it

3856.819 --> 3863.88
break you psychological warfare and then

3860.42 --> 3865.26
well you usually just fall into some

3863.88 --> 3870.98
kind of

3865.26 --> 3870.98
druggish or distracting addicting habit

4065.539 --> 4070.96
but I mean heating it up in an oven

4068.299 --> 4070.96
basically

4083.66 --> 4088.0
yeah the blue pill Evolution I mean

4088.28 --> 4095.5
I think Dale's gone the same road as or

4091.22 --> 4095.5
is going the same road as Bev

4095.839 --> 4103.239
I think that's the problem he's just

4098.179 --> 4103.2390000000005
he's like really degrading

4103.76 --> 4106.89
[Music]

4107.6 --> 4114.08
I mean spiritually it's going to gutter

4110.42 --> 4116.54
level now with Dell is really bad

4114.08 --> 4119.6
it's really pitiful

4116.54 --> 4122.14
because he's the one that's doing that

4119.6 --> 4122.14
yeah

4122.48 --> 4126.739
he's doing that

4124.699 --> 4127.759
it's the same kind of [ __ ] as Bev it's

4126.739 --> 4130.218999999999
just

4127.759 --> 4133.1
get really pitiful

4130.219 --> 4134.9
and really divisive and think oh no

4133.1 --> 4137.319
where are the there's we're the special

4134.9 --> 4137.3189999999995
boys

4138.679 --> 4146.06
and then base that on really nonsense

4142.179 --> 4148.279
just time wasting nonsense

4146.06 --> 4151.96
which is exactly what Dell is doing and

4148.279 --> 4151.96
what Bev has been doing for years

4153.56 --> 4159.14
and yeah you get a whole bunch of new

4156.319 --> 4162.5
people you'll get all the Gammas that

4159.14 --> 4167.12

4170.54 --> 4174.799
what they are and nobody can handle that

4173.0 --> 4176.299
are you going to destroy them so yeah

4174.799 --> 4178.1
you're gonna get the wave you're gonna

4176.299 --> 4182.299
get all the trolls

4178.1 --> 4183.9800000000005

4182.299 --> 4186.339

4202.34 --> 4207.92
finally it's gonna end

4205.04 --> 4210.56
because there there are hordes of really

4207.92 --> 4211.9400000000005
[ __ ] up desperate Goblin people out

4210.56 --> 4214.820000000001

4211.94 --> 4219.739
that really hate fed and that will

4214.82 --> 4222.679
befriend anybody that opposes them

4219.739 --> 4225.919999999999
and and like get all political bribery

4222.679 --> 4228.26
with it and all that it's out there and

4225.92 --> 4232.9
if you play into that you're a really a

4228.26 --> 4232.900000000001
pitiful piece of [ __ ] that's a fact

4253.29 --> 4265.96
[Music]

4263.36 --> 4265.96
foreign

4274.48 --> 4279.339999999999
yeah those things yeah I hate those

4277.159 --> 4279.339999999999
things

4280.34 --> 4284.06
oh you can do all those things without

4282.5 --> 4288.02
oil

4284.06 --> 4290.179
why the oil is the thing you want

4288.02 --> 4292.3
you just don't want the really cheap

4290.179 --> 4294.1
crap

4292.3 --> 4298.76
yeah

4294.1 --> 4302.120000000001
I mean what the [ __ ] is fries without

4298.76 --> 4303.7390000000005
proper organic olive oil to actually fry

4302.12 --> 4306.0199999999995
it in

4303.739 --> 4308.659
it's just crap

4306.02 --> 4313.159000000001
it is all about the oil I don't want

4308.659 --> 4316.719
oilless fries and stuff like

4313.159 --> 4316.719
it's [ __ ] [ __ ]

4320.06 --> 4324.1
never cook oil to me

4327.62 --> 4333.92
no I I will definitely keep cooking in

4330.62 --> 4335.739
oil and I will frying in it and it works

4333.92 --> 4338.719
great

4335.739 --> 4341.0
neurotoxin well those neurotoxins

4338.719 --> 4342.199
haven't really done anything negative

4341.0 --> 4346.84
for me

4342.199 --> 4346.839999999999
in the last five years Non-Stop

4346.88 --> 4350.32
so [ __ ]

4354.08 --> 4360.199
just don't overheat the oil

4356.96 --> 4363.8
don't use non-organic and you have to

4360.199 --> 4367.58
refresh the oil every now and then

4363.8 --> 4371.0
because especially if you get like

4367.58 --> 4373.4
just potato particulates that get darker

4371.0 --> 4375.62
and darker you have to filter it out

4373.4 --> 4377.48
somehow keep doing that and because if

4375.62 --> 4380.179
you leave those around that's gonna

4377.48 --> 4382.759999999999
indeed create toxins you will feel that

4380.179 --> 4386.42
yeah neurotox yeah you're not gonna

4382.76 --> 4389.900000000001
hallucinate from Frying fat but you will

4386.42 --> 4392.54
damn well feel it in your gut though

4389.9 --> 4395.9
yeah so you have to keep cleaning it up

4392.54 --> 4397.64
but yeah neurotoxin [ __ ] [ __ ]

4395.9 --> 4401.239
yeah

4397.64 --> 4404.96
Frying french fries in organic olive oil

4401.239 --> 4406.759999999999
like denutralized olive oil it's the

4404.96 --> 4409.179
best thing ever

4406.76 --> 4409.179
ever

4414.739 --> 4420.739
pizza and airfryer okay

4417.5 --> 4423.56
no I just use it

4420.739 --> 4427.04
induction type oven

4423.56 --> 4429.820000000001
Works Fantastical oh and I put olive oil

4427.04 --> 4429.82
on it

4429.92 --> 4435.82
yeah

4432.02 --> 4435.820000000001
because olive oil is great

4442.58 --> 4450.5
you don't oil fry Pizza

4446.42 --> 4454.28
no I'm not saying it to put the pizza in

4450.5 --> 4457.4
frying oil that's not what I meant

4454.28 --> 4460.219
it's just that you have the pizza you

4457.4 --> 4462.379999999999
sprinkle some olive oil do a couple of

4460.219 --> 4467.38
droplets on top of it

4462.38 --> 4467.38
that's great that really is great

4489.56 --> 4494.8
they do pizza into the toaster okay

4499.04 --> 4503.199
yeah go [ __ ] yourself [ __ ]

4507.739 --> 4514.178999999999
yeah neurotoxins don't make you

4510.26 --> 4514.179
comfortable you [ __ ] [ __ ]

4514.699 --> 4520.58
you don't even know what neurotoxins are

4518.179 --> 4523.4
you dumbass troll

4520.58 --> 4524.36
you literally don't even know what that

4523.4 --> 4528.08
is

4524.36 --> 4531.08
you'll have to separately now Google it

4528.08 --> 4532.699
and then try to understand even what the

4531.08 --> 4535.28
[ __ ] context is of what you're going

4532.699 --> 4539.0599999999995
to be reading because you're too dumb to

4535.28 --> 4541.219
put things into proper context

4539.06 --> 4543.4400000000005
because that's what trolls are they're

4541.219 --> 4547.82
[ __ ] retards

4543.44 --> 4550.699
and this [ __ ] God I mean

4547.82 --> 4552.739
that's not even a joke every time

4550.699 --> 4555.32
somebody says that about something else

4552.739 --> 4558.08
they are literally confessing that

4555.32 --> 4559.82
they're so [ __ ] that they deserve to

4558.08 --> 4563.54
be like

4559.82 --> 4566.719
executed for it like hi I'm so [ __ ]

4563.54 --> 4568.82
[ __ ] could you please get me

4566.719 --> 4570.5
could you please give me some kind of

4568.82 --> 4574.04
false promise that's gonna get me myself

4570.5 --> 4576.5
killed please I'm that [ __ ] stupid

4574.04 --> 4579.32
when you say something like that

4576.5 --> 4582.44
like nobody's gonna think that the

4579.32 --> 4585.199
target of what you're talking about is

4582.44 --> 4587.719
gonna be that stupid no you are that

4585.199 --> 4590.48
stupid for saying something that's that

4587.719 --> 4592.88
[ __ ] stupid only you

4590.48 --> 4595.82
okay

4592.88 --> 4599.6
because it's so pitiful and [ __ ] up

4595.82 --> 4601.82
[ __ ] to say something like that

4599.6 --> 4604.719
it just makes you sound like a [ __ ]

4601.82 --> 4606.98
[ __ ] that once the desperately

4604.719 --> 4609.199
subconsciously because consciously there

4606.98 --> 4611.659
is not much there but subconsciously

4609.199 --> 4614.0599999999995
they're just desperate to be put out of

4611.659 --> 4615.98
their misery because they just want to

4614.06 --> 4618.4400000000005
go back to the dirt

4615.98 --> 4620.5599999999995
like where they can operate on a

4618.44 --> 4623.839999999999
frequency that's closer to their

4620.56 --> 4627.38
comprehension yeah that of dirt

4623.84 --> 4631.84
yeah your intellectual range is that of

4627.38 --> 4631.84
dirt you [ __ ] [ __ ]

4632.32 --> 4635.32
thank you

4645.679 --> 4652.88
I mean he just wants to be dust again

4651.14 --> 4654.92
yeah

4652.88 --> 4657.56
intellect

4654.92 --> 4661.04
is just pulling him towards the mineral

4657.56 --> 4662.659000000001
world he just wants to be decomposed and

4661.04 --> 4663.98
be mineral again

4662.659 --> 4667.82
yeah

4663.98 --> 4669.98
so that is feeble pathetic little soul

4667.82 --> 4673.9
you can just like find a little bit more

4669.98 --> 4673.9
of a resonation to their own level

4677.659 --> 4682.879999999999
You could argue that putting them into

4679.94 --> 4686.659
the dirt is just bringing them back to

4682.88 --> 4691.34
their proper spiritual family yeah the

4686.659 --> 4693.62
worms the fungi in the ground yeah

4691.34 --> 4697.2390000000005
that's where your Consciousness belongs

4693.62 --> 4697.239
you [ __ ] little [ __ ]

4704.96 --> 4712.72
yeah that's how you insult somebody

4708.3 --> 4712.72
[Music]

4723.5 --> 4726.52
right anyway

4747.62 --> 4752.48
right and not really infected by trolls

4750.739 --> 4755.0199999999995
doctor I mean these trolls are always

4752.48 --> 4755.0199999999995
hanging around

4755.54 --> 4761.12
but all they want is is base they just

4759.199 --> 4762.98
want to be tortured to death that's all

4761.12 --> 4764.84
right and

4762.98 --> 4767.419999999999
they're like maybe if this world just

4764.84 --> 4769.88
gets [ __ ] up enough finally I'll have

4767.42 --> 4771.7390000000005
my wish one day I'll act like a complete

4769.88 --> 4774.14
piece of [ __ ] and suddenly somebody

4771.739 --> 4777.259999999999
shows up at my door

4774.14 --> 4780.26
in anticipation of that behavior

4777.26 --> 4782.659000000001
and will then drag me into his little

4780.26 --> 4785.719
van make me disappear in a little

4782.659 --> 4788.54
dungeon and then I can have my digits of

4785.719 --> 4791.54
my body cut off one at a time and singed

4788.54 --> 4794.179
with a hot iron

4791.54 --> 4797.0
for a couple of weeks right I mean

4794.179 --> 4800.12
that's what you really long for when

4797.0 --> 4802.4
you're that [ __ ] [ __ ]

4800.12 --> 4804.98
it's like your body is just like so

4802.4 --> 4807.44
repulsed by the the nature of this

4804.98 --> 4809.659
intelligence that your spirit is spirit

4807.44 --> 4813.0199999999995
is experiencing that is just like

4809.659 --> 4816.32
they're actually longing for death

4813.02 --> 4818.4800000000005
yeah these people actually long for

4816.32 --> 4820.5199999999995
death and they're disappointed that

4818.48 --> 4822.919999999999
murder isn't legal so that somebody

4820.52 --> 4824.6
couldn't just barge in and to [ __ ]

4822.92 --> 4826.52
chop them up

4824.6 --> 4828.9400000000005
because that's really what they want

4826.52 --> 4828.9400000000005
inside

4830.659 --> 4836.86
yeah and that's the thing that's pushing

4833.719 --> 4836.86
them to that behavior

4839.54 --> 4843.8
because

4841.94 --> 4846.98
that's the thing that that behavior

4843.8 --> 4850.1
would lead to so all you're doing is

4846.98 --> 4853.099999999999
just like trying to create a world where

4850.1 --> 4856.1
you can finally get killed in the way

4853.1 --> 4859.159000000001
that you deserve you [ __ ] piece of

4856.1 --> 4861.08
[ __ ] yeah that's the reality of it and I

4859.159 --> 4865.219
know that

4861.08 --> 4869.48
and no that's why you keep coming back

4865.219 --> 4872.56
you just want me to tell it to you on

4869.48 --> 4874.759999999999
the level that is real

4872.56 --> 4877.219
that's why you come back with your

4874.76 --> 4879.860000000001
[ __ ] up sock accounts

4877.219 --> 4882.1
because you want me to tell you how it

4879.86 --> 4882.099999999999
is

4882.5 --> 4887.719
yeah well keep on doing what you do

4885.26 --> 4890.0
because one day your dream might come

4887.719 --> 4893.0
true one day

4890.0 --> 4895.76
you might talk [ __ ] about the wrong

4893.0 --> 4898.46
person in the wrong time in the wrong

4895.76 --> 4900.92
place and then yeah you will get people

4898.46 --> 4904.52
barging into your door and they won't be

4900.92 --> 4906.5
wearing SWAT team outfits yeah and now

4904.52 --> 4909.580000000001
you're [ __ ] and you're finally gonna

4906.5 --> 4914.56
get what you deserve you [ __ ]

4909.58 --> 4914.5599999999995
degenerate scumbag piece of trash

4917.98 --> 4923.599999999999
we are making it a world for you you're

4920.78 --> 4926.36
making it for yourself by your actions

4923.6 --> 4929.0
what you do how you do it

4926.36 --> 4931.88
how you spend your time every day

4929.0 --> 4933.14
where you want your Consciousness to

4931.88 --> 4936.1990000000005
dwell

4933.14 --> 4938.6
you're creating that if inevitable

4936.199 --> 4940.219
outcome for yourself by those actions

4938.6 --> 4942.620000000001
yeah

4940.219 --> 4944.179
and I'm here to remind you about that

4942.62 --> 4946.88
that's why you like to come back because

4944.179 --> 4950.84
you're kind of fascinating like why am I

4946.88 --> 4952.82
just casually maneuvering myself closer

4950.84 --> 4955.6990000000005
and closer to hell

4952.82 --> 4957.62
yeah why am I doing that oh baby Arwin

4955.699 --> 4961.36
could tell me yeah yeah I am telling you

4957.62 --> 4961.36
yeah I'm telling you

4968.659 --> 4971.659
I would make a great Game of Thrones

4970.58 --> 4974.8
character

4971.659 --> 4974.799999999999
I'm sure I would

4976.46 --> 4979.36
sure I would

4991.88 --> 4995.900000000001
problem is though that it just wouldn't

4993.739 --> 4997.879999999999
work because Game of Thrones is just

4995.9 --> 5000.699
[ __ ] repulsive and they do that to

4997.88 --> 5003.1
people that are good I mean the torture

5000.699 --> 5004.839999999999
of something that's actually like

5003.1 --> 5007.06
valuable

5004.84 --> 5011.860000000001
to actually mutilate that which is

5007.06 --> 5013.659000000001
beautiful is a horrendous crime

5011.86 --> 5016.179
it is horrendous

5013.659 --> 5019.179
but people like this

5016.179 --> 5022.0
you know they're not like that you know

5019.179 --> 5024.88
they're sniveling little troll maggot

5022.0 --> 5028.36
looking Goblin pieces of [ __ ] that have

5024.88 --> 5031.4800000000005
severe mental issues have no

5028.36 --> 5033.0599999999995
history of family that actually cares

5031.48 --> 5035.98
for them because they were probably

5033.06 --> 5039.219
repulsive the second they were born

5035.98 --> 5040.659
that's not their fault

5039.219 --> 5043.179
but

5040.659 --> 5046.0599999999995
you didn't really take the Challenge

5043.179 --> 5048.219
from God and like went against it

5046.06 --> 5050.38
against a lot to become a good person

5048.219 --> 5051.4
anyway yeah you didn't take the

5050.38 --> 5054.0
challenge

5051.4 --> 5057.58
to get the ultimate reward no you just

5054.0 --> 5059.44
gave into it

5057.58 --> 5061.9
and so

5059.44 --> 5063.4
that leads you

5061.9 --> 5066.759999999999
to that end

5063.4 --> 5070.44
to that one end that you deserve

5066.76 --> 5070.4400000000005
because you failed

5070.84 --> 5075.219
you failed to take the challenge the

5073.48 --> 5077.199
hard challenge that could have made you

5075.219 --> 5079.3
actually better than everybody and

5077.199 --> 5082.178999999999
inspiring and

5079.3 --> 5084.400000000001
happy yeah

5082.179 --> 5086.08
I mean even if you're bored in a family

5084.4 --> 5089.86
that's just

5086.08 --> 5091.42
ugly and stupid and all that you can be

5089.86 --> 5094.42
a Matilda

5091.42 --> 5097.719
yeah that's what that book was about

5094.42 --> 5101.32
Matilda it's really about that

5097.719 --> 5103.42
bright spark inside of a inside of a

5101.32 --> 5105.219
litter box

5103.42 --> 5109.179
that's what that's about

5105.219 --> 5111.699
yeah you can but it's brutal it's brutal

5109.179 --> 5113.8
though it's very hard but it's so

5111.699 --> 5117.159
rewarding if you do it

5113.8 --> 5119.92
yeah and if you don't do it you end up

5117.159 --> 5122.98
like a worthless maggot

5119.92 --> 5124.659
ugly unhappy

5122.98 --> 5129.54
cowardly

5124.659 --> 5129.54
and just trying to bully others

5131.34 --> 5137.14
and and you maneuver the the spirit of

5134.98 --> 5139.9
this world in a certain way by doing

5137.14 --> 5141.76
that and and multiplying having more

5139.9 --> 5144.58
people be like that

5141.76 --> 5147.280000000001
it's gonna maneuver to a spirit

5144.58 --> 5149.5
in the world that's very merciless

5147.28 --> 5150.88
and that will eventually conclude like

5149.5 --> 5153.82
yeah

5150.88 --> 5156.28
it's not about people that are ugly or

5153.82 --> 5159.84
more formed it's about people that are

5156.28 --> 5159.84
psychologically deranged

5160.96 --> 5168.159
and they need to basically feel an equal

5165.34 --> 5171.6990000000005
and opposite amount of pain

5168.159 --> 5174.638999999999
to either snap them out of it or

5171.699 --> 5176.138999999999
collapse them in on themselves

5174.639 --> 5178.84
it's gonna happen you're gonna push it

5176.139 --> 5181.0
with your sniveling maggot Behavior

5178.84 --> 5185.56
enough of you go crawling around

5181.0 --> 5189.159
eventually the exterminator will come

5185.56 --> 5192.4800000000005
and you get what you deserve for your

5189.159 --> 5192.48
sniveling cowardice

5203.92 --> 5209.679
[Music]

5207.1 --> 5212.9800000000005
sure it's one person

5209.679 --> 5213.9400000000005
mostly blue pill devil it's probably a

5212.98 --> 5216.339999999999
couple

5213.94 --> 5219.94
I mean

5216.34 --> 5222.04
it's not all one person

5219.94 --> 5224.62
but when there's like a whole bunch of

5222.04 --> 5227.08
soccer counts popping up getting banned

5224.62 --> 5229.54
I mean that's usually one person that's

5227.08 --> 5232.719
just doing that but I mean there are

5229.54 --> 5235.239
multiple trolls it's

5232.719 --> 5238.54
that would be great by the way if it was

5235.239 --> 5240.638999999999
just one person that did all that

5238.54 --> 5242.679
trolling everywhere that would be

5240.639 --> 5245.1990000000005
amazing because then

5242.679 --> 5247.06
you could actually attempt to find out

5245.199 --> 5249.339999999999
who it is

5247.06 --> 5251.139
and [ __ ] throw them in the garbage

5249.34 --> 5252.88
disposal

5251.139 --> 5256.02
piece by piece

5252.88 --> 5256.02
still attached

5258.699 --> 5263.138999999999
and then yeah no more trolling wouldn't

5261.34 --> 5266.860000000001
that be something but unfortunately it's

5263.139 --> 5269.62
not just one troll but when it's like

5266.86 --> 5272.259999999999
a lot of soccer cards getting boundaries

5269.62 --> 5275.76
banned respawn that's usually just one

5272.26 --> 5275.76
person when that happens

5280.06 --> 5284.26
I mean there's plenty of trolls out

5281.92 --> 5288.06
there that really they do kind of just

5284.26 --> 5288.06
leave after they get banned

5288.28 --> 5293.92
right for some trolls out there they're

5290.8 --> 5297.6990000000005
not that [ __ ] up hellish

5293.92 --> 5299.62
they just want to get to that point

5297.699 --> 5302.5599999999995
where they're starting out like oh yeah

5299.62 --> 5306.219
no I'm a reasonable person and then they

5302.56 --> 5308.4400000000005
slowly go sideways and then suddenly

5306.219 --> 5310.179
they become inappropriate but not in an

5308.44 --> 5312.5199999999995
overt way it's just like Suddenly It's

5310.179 --> 5314.679
like unexpected and they and they want

5312.52 --> 5317.080000000001
to just slide it to the point where like

5314.679 --> 5320.62
the host gets really frustrated doesn't

5317.08 --> 5322.719
know like I don't know what is this

5320.62 --> 5324.76
that's what they like to do those are

5322.719 --> 5327.46
like the psychological torturing trolls

5324.76 --> 5329.320000000001
are usually more intelligent but those

5327.46 --> 5330.699
people are not like sock account

5329.32 --> 5332.739
spammers

5330.699 --> 5335.32
because the soccer count spamming type

5332.739 --> 5336.339999999999
of troll are really [ __ ] [ __ ]

5335.32 --> 5338.799999999999
usually

5336.34 --> 5341.9800000000005
and them

5338.8 --> 5346.0
like oh you can't keep me out of your

5341.98 --> 5348.28
face is what they think makes them smart

5346.0 --> 5350.44
so they go out of their way

5348.28 --> 5351.699
to like make a lot of soccercons and

5350.44 --> 5353.678999999999
just keep getting in your face right

5351.699 --> 5357.04
those are like the really annoying type

5353.679 --> 5359.7390000000005
of trolls not subtle not not effective

5357.04 --> 5363.94
not manipulative just [ __ ] annoying

5359.739 --> 5367.48
those people are actually really dumb

5363.94 --> 5369.58
now the the smarter psychological trolls

5367.48 --> 5371.32
they usually don't make soccer cards

5369.58 --> 5373.239
because at the time where they get

5371.32 --> 5374.98
banned they already got their

5373.239 --> 5378.82
gratification because they already

5374.98 --> 5380.379999999999
tricked the person in several stages

5378.82 --> 5383.139
yeah they already got their

5380.38 --> 5385.179
gratification from it they don't need to

5383.139 --> 5386.26
make multiple soccer cards to get in

5385.179 --> 5388.54
your face

5386.26 --> 5389.7390000000005
they just need to get to that one point

5388.54 --> 5393.1
where

5389.739 --> 5394.9
where they got banned because you trade

5393.1 --> 5398.26
you were tricked

5394.9 --> 5401.638999999999
yeah good breakdowns I know because I

5398.26 --> 5401.639
actually know what I'm talking about

5403.9 --> 5408.219
Mr Sensitive

5405.84 --> 5411.76
sensible yeah he is one of those

5408.219 --> 5413.92
bastards he is a real sadist like that

5411.76 --> 5415.780000000001
and he just likes them and he does it on

5413.92 --> 5418.179
camera he just likes to manipulate you

5415.78 --> 5420.759999999999
and just like tear you down and like

5418.179 --> 5424.86
stare you in the eyes when he does it

5420.76 --> 5424.860000000001
really really creepy figure

5426.9 --> 5432.159
yeah I get a bit threatening and [ __ ]

5429.94 --> 5434.259999999999
and I might even stare right at the

5432.159 --> 5436.239
camera when I do it

5434.26 --> 5438.9400000000005
but that's more of a dominance I'm not

5436.239 --> 5440.199
like trying to creep toward towards you

5438.94 --> 5442.719
like a

5440.199 --> 5445.0599999999995
like a crocodile or something right I'm

5442.719 --> 5447.4
not a predator

5445.06 --> 5450.120000000001
Mr sensible is a predator

5447.4 --> 5453.239
he oozes like this

5450.12 --> 5456.94
creepy sadism

5453.239 --> 5459.459999999999
creepy creepy man

5456.94 --> 5462.5199999999995
yeah with me it's just like what you

5459.46 --> 5465.219
want bro except I do it [ __ ] smart

5462.52 --> 5468.219
I'm threatening in a smart way I

5465.219 --> 5469.9
threaten with my insight yeah it's very

5468.219 --> 5471.34
threatening when somebody's like oh come

5469.9 --> 5473.5
with me bro

5471.34 --> 5476.32
and then I'm like oh

5473.5 --> 5479.5
I know exactly what your weaknesses are

5476.32 --> 5481.9
just by looking at you you Pro I'm gonna

5479.5 --> 5484.239
mention certain weaknesses about you

5481.9 --> 5488.5199999999995
right now standing here just like this

5484.239 --> 5493.178999999999
that you've you don't even know you have

5488.52 --> 5495.6990000000005
yeah that's my tactic yeah I assault

5493.179 --> 5498.76
them with truth they can't handle

5495.699 --> 5501.94
that if it is actually useful yeah

5498.76 --> 5503.38
that's my strategy I'm not a creepy

5501.94 --> 5506.62
predator

5503.38 --> 5509.1990000000005
I slap you with Awakening I use

5506.62 --> 5513.099999999999
Awakening as a weapon

5509.199 --> 5514.36
that's right I use Consciousness as a

5513.1 --> 5516.1
weapon

5514.36 --> 5519.719
when I need to

5516.1 --> 5519.719
and I'm very good at it

5525.06 --> 5528.409000000001
[Music]

5532.179 --> 5536.02
yeah

5533.46 --> 5538.96
the roof is different

5536.02 --> 5542.9800000000005
proof is not a sadist like Mr sensible

5538.96 --> 5545.5
but he does really like to tracheal

5542.98 --> 5547.178999999999
roof is like really more of a word

5545.5 --> 5549.219
wizard type

5547.179 --> 5553.2390000000005
he's like gonna slip you into it and

5549.219 --> 5555.1
just say something and then hope that by

5553.239 --> 5558.459999999999
him saying it's so confident and

5555.1 --> 5560.139
smoothly you accidentally just believe

5558.46 --> 5563.139
that it's right

5560.139 --> 5567.639
like Ruf likes to really trick your mind

5563.139 --> 5570.900000000001
he's a genuine wizard like a magician

5567.639 --> 5570.900000000001
type wizard

5571.48 --> 5577.9
very like cognitively manipulative

5574.78 --> 5580.659
that's ruhef it's not a like a social

5577.9 --> 5586.138999999999
sadist like Mr sensible

5580.659 --> 5586.138999999999
but yeah a predator in that sense too

5586.6 --> 5590.159000000001
hello moon buggy

5596.5 --> 5600.48
Brenda hiding behind suck

5600.88 --> 5605.76
yeah but Brenda is not really very

5603.04 --> 5605.76
hiding though

5612.52 --> 5618.659000000001
Brenda Brenda is different Brenda just

5615.4 --> 5618.659
kind of wants to dominate

5619.06 --> 5624.54
she wants to make you accept things

5626.86 --> 5630.179
that's what she wants

5631.0 --> 5637.84
and and also she really likes to

5634.12 --> 5640.96
describe Christ in a in a poor way

5637.84 --> 5644.02
in a terrible way because she's like

5640.96 --> 5648.4
actively anti-christian

5644.02 --> 5651.34
like not Antichrist I would say like not

5648.4 --> 5654.28
Christians but the actual Christ is like

5651.34 --> 5656.26
she genuinely hates Christ

5654.28 --> 5658.54
she's one of the people that would like

5656.26 --> 5660.280000000001
without any objection just start talking

5658.54 --> 5661.9
about how he's burning in the lake of

5660.28 --> 5665.32
[ __ ] and all that

5661.9 --> 5667.78
just for fun because she genuinely hates

5665.32 --> 5672.659
that Christ figure

5667.78 --> 5672.659
so retina is a whole different class

5673.36 --> 5678.659
I find Brenda actually more creepy than

5676.36 --> 5678.659
most

5684.58 --> 5691.199
hello clammy

5686.86 --> 5691.199
where have I been on my backup Channel

5696.28 --> 5701.98
oh you think you're in this land oh I'm

5700.84 --> 5705.659000000001
so smart

5701.98 --> 5705.659
I'm so smart saying that

5709.6 --> 5713.9800000000005
nice control

5712.3 --> 5717.34
okay at least it's not worth it you're

5713.98 --> 5721.5
not intelligent enough

5717.34 --> 5721.5
to fake being a fake person

5723.639 --> 5728.679
and Brenda's name was in full View

5727.48 --> 5730.839999999999
yeah

5728.679 --> 5732.9400000000005
now Brenda doesn't make suck accounts

5730.84 --> 5734.38
like that she doesn't she wants to be

5732.94 --> 5737.08
known

5734.38 --> 5738.88
so Brenda will make other YouTube

5737.08 --> 5740.8
accounts

5738.88 --> 5744.6990000000005
but you will always put her name in it

5740.8 --> 5746.5
she just wants to be in your face

5744.699 --> 5748.9
and blabber

5746.5 --> 5752.38
she's not Anonymous she's not like an

5748.9 --> 5755.62
anonymous figure like that

5752.38 --> 5758.139
do you drink raw eggs no

5755.62 --> 5760.62
I mean I'm not against it but no I don't

5758.139 --> 5760.62
do that

5764.86 --> 5768.659
I like my eggs baked

5773.26 --> 5778.84
yes and to live in catharsis that that

5776.62 --> 5781.12
Rena is indeed

5778.84 --> 5783.6990000000005
the brand that we're talking about the

5781.12 --> 5788.58
Brenda is back

5783.699 --> 5788.58
that's the one the one with the pie icon

5790.9 --> 5797.4
hey more colored

5793.0 --> 5797.4
oh it's been ages since I've seen you

5809.08 --> 5814.08
where have you been man I mean I haven't

5811.06 --> 5814.080000000001
seen you in years

5814.84 --> 5819.159000000001
I haven't seen you such a long time

5816.699 --> 5820.659
enough that that you don't even have a

5819.159 --> 5824.879999999999
wrench

5820.659 --> 5828.179
have you given Jim Bob another chance no

5824.88 --> 5828.179
absolutely not

5829.719 --> 5838.06
I mean I don't need some guy that's like

5832.679 --> 5840.54
freaky pedo adjacent or whatever

5838.06 --> 5843.219
that's like

5840.54 --> 5845.8
like the whole thing is so like the

5843.219 --> 5848.08
guy's a massive hypocrite and like

5845.8 --> 5851.08
intolerable levels

5848.08 --> 5853.9
right and this [ __ ] hermeneutic

5851.08 --> 5857.0199999999995
Christianity [ __ ] fanaticism too

5853.9 --> 5860.46
it's like intolerable I'm not gonna be

5857.02 --> 5860.46
sitting through that again

5875.679 --> 5879.34
ah

5877.36 --> 5882.4
all right Marco yeah that's very

5879.34 --> 5885.34
sensible man I mean yeah you can go nuts

5882.4 --> 5887.44
out there so if you if you can minimize

5885.34 --> 5890.62
it

5887.44 --> 5894.219
yeah that's great I I do it myself it's

5890.62 --> 5897.5199999999995
just that today I'm in a weird mood and

5894.219 --> 5899.92
and it's like I unbanned everybody so

5897.52 --> 5901.719
all the trolls are coming by so I yeah I

5899.92 --> 5905.04
got a bit dark

5901.719 --> 5905.04
but I mean [ __ ] them

5911.98 --> 5915.48
but yeah

5918.36 --> 5925.259999999999
I mean yeah I'm not gonna say anything

5921.219 --> 5925.26
more it's gonna go too far

5942.94 --> 5947.219
going in circles not healthy at all yeah

5947.38 --> 5952.54
no good that you took care of yourself

5949.239 --> 5954.959999999999
man that's really important I'm glad you

5952.54 --> 5954.96
did that

5955.36 --> 5960.88
oh vibing well I've not been moving away

5958.239 --> 5965.459999999999
but I have been really more active

5960.88 --> 5965.46
trying to avoid dark [ __ ] and all that

5968.739 --> 5973.599999999999
I mean me just going off on the trolls

5971.139 --> 5976.7390000000005
is like the first real dark things that

5973.6 --> 5976.7390000000005
I've said in a while

5977.32 --> 5982.199
because I really do try to avoid it I

5980.02 --> 5982.1990000000005
just

5982.56 --> 5988.96
the ideal scenario would be that I

5986.56 --> 5990.159000000001
literally forget that it happened that I

5988.96 --> 5992.92
don't get to see it that it doesn't

5990.159 --> 5995.28
influence me but they do still die

5992.92 --> 5995.28
though

5995.62 --> 5998.94
that would be ideal

5999.04 --> 6004.8
I just don't wanna

6001.159 --> 6007.04
describe all that I just want it to

6004.8 --> 6007.04
happen

6015.659 --> 6020.239
and I could go into further detail but I

6017.88 --> 6020.2390000000005
shouldn't

6020.699 --> 6025.259999999999
I'm gonna basically act out the trauma

6023.34 --> 6027.0
of the [ __ ] that I've seen anyway when I

6025.26 --> 6029.1
do it it's not good

6027.0 --> 6032.46
because I don't want that stuff to

6029.1 --> 6034.620000000001
really spread using me as a vessel to do

6032.46 --> 6038.659
it

6034.62 --> 6038.659
not overrated oh awesome dude

6041.219 --> 6046.9800000000005
wow

6043.38 --> 6049.02
go Marco awesome

6046.98 --> 6051.739
did you have fewer trolls on the backup

6049.02 --> 6051.7390000000005
Channel yes

6056.159 --> 6059.599999999999
feel great that's awesome

6069.139 --> 6074.28
great to hear

6071.1 --> 6076.860000000001
I mean it sounds like you're crushing it

6074.28 --> 6078.96
I mean staying away from psychologically

6076.86 --> 6081.9
damaging internet

6078.96 --> 6084.54
nonsense and losing weight and feeling

6081.9 --> 6087.199
good dude you're crushing it

6084.54 --> 6087.199
well done

6100.679 --> 6106.6990000000005
Oswald Spangler all right

6104.219 --> 6106.699
okay

6108.9 --> 6111.619
I remember

6110.46 --> 6114.86
oh

6111.619 --> 6114.86
come on

6127.739 --> 6134.0
oh wow that looks intense

6130.739 --> 6134.0
history video

6157.199 --> 6160.4
oh wow cool

6160.92 --> 6165.659
yeah great great to hear from you go

6164.1 --> 6168.320000000001
there more color really glad you're

6165.659 --> 6168.32
doing so good

6170.84 --> 6174.659000000001
all right but yeah and to live in

6173.1 --> 6176.58
catharsis I will take a look at that

6174.659 --> 6178.379999999999
video does scrolling through it it does

6176.58 --> 6180.719
look interesting so thanks for that it's

6178.38 --> 6183.2390000000005
not even that long but it looks really

6180.719 --> 6185.78
intense so thanks for the tip I will

6183.239 --> 6185.78
check it out

6188.46 --> 6192.2390000000005
maneuver towards the end of the show

6190.08 --> 6195.5599999999995
already because

6192.239 --> 6195.5599999999995
15 more minutes

6206.34 --> 6211.8
40 watching huh

6208.92 --> 6214.9800000000005
well that's something new though

6211.8 --> 6217.320000000001
the the peak of the amount of viewers at

6214.98 --> 6219.54
my backup channel would not get that

6217.32 --> 6221.58
high that's the big difference I'm

6219.54 --> 6223.86
having 40 watching right now that's

6221.58 --> 6225.719
higher than I've ever had

6223.86 --> 6228.239
in the last three months of my backup

6225.719 --> 6231.56
channel so that's like the one advantage

6228.239 --> 6231.5599999999995
more Peak viewers

6234.3 --> 6238.04
hey wait what

6238.5 --> 6242.54
the hell television didn't you

6246.06 --> 6250.7390000000005
all right yeah you left and then you

6249.0 --> 6253.98
come back okay I thought it was like

6250.739 --> 6255.178999999999
another Television right

6253.98 --> 6257.9
so

6255.179 --> 6257.9
yeah wrench

6261.54 --> 6267.42
you subscribe to my backup Channel

6263.52 --> 6271.320000000001
awesome hey Nathan R welcome back

6267.42 --> 6274.32
link to backup Channel okay fine

6271.32 --> 6277.699
I'll get to it

6274.32 --> 6277.699
It's Our Winning bear

6285.06 --> 6289.8
just finished lunch all right yeah

6287.28 --> 6293.099999999999
welcome back

6289.8 --> 6297.26
it's been a bit messy here

6293.1 --> 6297.26
had some Trolls but I expected that

6313.219 --> 6319.86
yeah yeah indeed no I'm Antelope great

6317.76 --> 6322.08
I'm really looking forward to checking

6319.86 --> 6324.299999999999
out that video

6322.08 --> 6326.639
also because it's not it's not nine

6324.3 --> 6329.04
hours or something

6326.639 --> 6330.900000000001
it makes it a lot more palatable

6329.04 --> 6335.3
but I mean I will check it out

6330.9 --> 6335.299999999999
definitely thanks for the video link

6339.9 --> 6344.339999999999
which are not a

6341.719 --> 6345.719
pessimist in belief of civilization

6344.34 --> 6347.6990000000005
being sick

6345.719 --> 6351.6
okay

6347.699 --> 6354.239
well I'll check it out and I'll see

6351.6 --> 6356.1
and we'll yeah you can get back to me

6354.239 --> 6358.699
about it we can talk about it tomorrow

6356.1 --> 6358.6990000000005
or something

6360.42 --> 6366.4800000000005
but then do bring it up though because

6363.0 --> 6370.139
it might be that I'll forget

6366.48 --> 6372.119
to bring it up I mean I do I mostly

6370.139 --> 6375.3
watch the videos that you guys recommend

6372.119 --> 6377.88
me but I don't always remember that I

6375.3 --> 6379.26
watched them the next day

6377.88 --> 6382.26
right

6379.26 --> 6385.58
that part sometimes I forget so it's

6382.26 --> 6385.58
helpful if you then remind me

6387.84 --> 6390.32
but anyway

6396.98 --> 6403.44
waiting for more parts all right

6401.34 --> 6407.34
colored

6403.44 --> 6410.119
have I taken on any new projects

6407.34 --> 6410.119000000001
Jesus

6412.5 --> 6418.199
yeah yeah if you get a new house yeah

6415.38 --> 6421.26
you're gonna have to you're gonna have a

6418.199 --> 6423.739
lot of projects that's right

6421.26 --> 6427.320000000001
I don't really have any new projects

6423.739 --> 6429.839999999999
I've had a little bit of a project with

6427.32 --> 6432.78
my plants and I keep

6429.84 --> 6434.76
on my balcony

6432.78 --> 6437.639
and then I'm taking a little bit more

6434.76 --> 6440.820000000001
serious I got some fertilizer stuff and

6437.639 --> 6445.26
I got some actual dirt in a bag

6440.82 --> 6448.259999999999
one of those palette things right

6445.26 --> 6450.06
so yeah I'm doing a little bit of more

6448.26 --> 6454.159000000001
serious plant growing other than just

6450.06 --> 6454.159000000001
keeping it on my kitchen counter

6454.739 --> 6460.199
at the window

6457.199 --> 6462.299999999999
and that's it really and the other thing

6460.199 --> 6465.119
that I have been getting more into is

6462.3 --> 6467.88
well the GTI is kind of like it's it's

6465.119 --> 6472.0199999999995
kind of sort of working

6467.88 --> 6474.54
and I I'm actually well I have a bit shy

6472.02 --> 6476.639
on donations right now so so that I

6474.54 --> 6479.82
could potentially get some it sounds

6476.639 --> 6482.28
crazy get some crypto of a certain type

6479.82 --> 6484.619
that I could use basically as an

6482.28 --> 6488.34
unplugging device

6484.619 --> 6490.0199999999995
to translate all these GTI based tokens

6488.34 --> 6492.900000000001
into

6490.02 --> 6496.26
other type tokens that can literally be

6492.9 --> 6499.32
exchanged for cash in the bank

6496.26 --> 6501.659000000001
so I've been kind of on to that that's

6499.32 --> 6504.42
been rolling it it would got really

6501.659 --> 6506.339999999999
stuck a while back so bad that it's

6504.42 --> 6509.639
super frustrating me and I just didn't

6506.34 --> 6511.26
want to get into it now that's kind of

6509.639 --> 6512.76
like it's been fixed all those

6511.26 --> 6515.54
situations be fixed so I'm kind of like

6512.76 --> 6515.54
in the middle of that

6516.78 --> 6522.48
I've figured out like how I can actually

6519.3 --> 6526.139
buy crypto

6522.48 --> 6528.959999999999
like using PayPal even it's interesting

6526.139 --> 6531.659000000001
so I'm getting a little I'm making a few

6528.96 --> 6533.4
advances in that sense

6531.659 --> 6534.9
but yeah other than that the overall

6533.4 --> 6536.759999999999
situation I mean it hasn't really

6534.9 --> 6539.5199999999995
changed all that much I financially

6536.76 --> 6543.860000000001
still need help and I'm really shy for

6539.52 --> 6543.860000000001
donations I really am guys

6544.139 --> 6548.28
I mean

6545.639 --> 6551.6990000000005
yeah

6548.28 --> 6553.92
if you help me out now then I'm going to

6551.699 --> 6557.159
be less panicked

6553.92 --> 6560.0
when it's halfway the next month again

6557.159 --> 6560.0
seriously

6561.54 --> 6567.3
so any support would be great I still

6563.88 --> 6570.06
need it but there is like an end

6567.3 --> 6573.78
there's light at the end of this tunnel

6570.06 --> 6576.2390000000005
because if I if I find my way through

6573.78 --> 6579.9
with the GTI and can actually like

6576.239 --> 6582.78
unplug it so that it can be transformed

6579.9 --> 6585.92
into Cash well Ben I could potentially

6582.78 --> 6590.0
if it holds up

6585.92 --> 6590.0
subtly get out of poverty

6590.219 --> 6595.8
because that GTI thing is really rolling

6592.86 --> 6597.839999999999
it's rolling pretty heavy

6595.8 --> 6600.0
I mean there's days there's just like oh

6597.84 --> 6603.2390000000005
oh certainly like 100 euros worth of

6600.0 --> 6607.44
tokens just like poof oh there you go

6603.239 --> 6610.5
all you have to do is somehow actually

6607.44 --> 6612.96
figure out a way to cash it

6610.5 --> 6616.44
but I mean that just happens on a daily

6612.96 --> 6618.3
basis I mean it is pretty serious

6616.44 --> 6621.0599999999995
yeah and I'm not losing any money

6618.3 --> 6623.88
because I'm not doing trading I'm not

6621.06 --> 6625.619000000001
like oh I'll buy this crypto and also

6623.88 --> 6628.08
when it's more expensive or something

6625.619 --> 6630.0
I'm not doing that

6628.08 --> 6632.46
I'm not

6630.0 --> 6633.6
trying to be like a stock broker with

6632.46 --> 6636.42
crypto

6633.6 --> 6641.159000000001
that's not what I'm doing at all

6636.42 --> 6643.8
no I literally have an infinite fount

6641.159 --> 6646.699
of assets

6643.8 --> 6649.9800000000005
of these crypto type assets

6646.699 --> 6652.5
that are a little tough

6649.98 --> 6655.08
to to find a way through to actually be

6652.5 --> 6656.88
able to cash it but they're working hard

6655.08 --> 6660.3
on it

6656.88 --> 6663.02
and there are Roots now there is a a

6660.3 --> 6663.02
caching point

6663.06 --> 6668.639
it is possible but yeah I need initial

6665.76 --> 6671.280000000001
amounts and that can only be bought with

6668.639 --> 6673.92
actual cash from the bank so that that's

6671.28 --> 6676.92
annoying or I'd have to wait a whole lot

6673.92 --> 6679.5
until other GTI people just have so much

6676.92 --> 6682.38
of it produced that they'll just like

6679.5 --> 6685.34
Give It Away basically trade it for

6682.38 --> 6689.04
regular tokens instead of actual money

6685.34 --> 6691.56
so on the long run I might get lucky and

6689.04 --> 6694.32
then never have to spam the sand or I

6691.56 --> 6696.2390000000005
could somehow get like a hundred euros

6694.32 --> 6699.0599999999995
together

6696.239 --> 6701.459999999999
and start doing it now and then have it

6699.06 --> 6705.84
potentially much quicker

6701.46 --> 6709.08
but there is pretty much a

6705.84 --> 6711.84
yeah an end point where there will be

6709.08 --> 6714.54
money coming out of it and potentially

6711.84 --> 6718.1990000000005
so much that I might even like no longer

6714.54 --> 6720.0
need to go and get social welfare even

6718.199 --> 6723.659
so

6720.0 --> 6725.699
really looking forward to that

6723.659 --> 6729.0599999999995
I've got a lot of Hope out of that

6725.699 --> 6732.178999999999
situation changed for myself

6729.06 --> 6735.119000000001
but I yeah it's the Hope unfortunately

6732.179 --> 6738.36
doesn't fill my belly

6735.119 --> 6741.36
I do actually need donation based

6738.36 --> 6743.88
support still to get around that's not

6741.36 --> 6747.54
gonna change

6743.88 --> 6750.78
very quickly it might like change around

6747.54 --> 6754.199
in like a year or so

6750.78 --> 6756.5599999999995
maybe even sooner but I'm not counting

6754.199 --> 6756.5599999999995
on it

6756.78 --> 6763.04
do I have to give money to get no that's

6759.36 --> 6763.04
the point I don't claim you

6763.38 --> 6766.159000000001
I don't

6767.28 --> 6774.659
but I might need to give

6771.179 --> 6777.84
some other thing a Trader money to get

6774.659 --> 6780.599999999999
the right crypto tokens in order to get

6777.84 --> 6785.52
this procedure started where

6780.6 --> 6789.42
the GTI crypto can be transformed into

6785.52 --> 6793.38
the other crypto which can be exchanged

6789.42 --> 6796.6990000000005
for cash in the bank

6793.38 --> 6796.6990000000005
that's where I'm at

6797.52 --> 6804.42
don't look extreme yeah but it isn't

6800.28 --> 6807.78
yeah this scam has cost me zero thus far

6804.42 --> 6810.54
I've already made like 600 euros out of

6807.78 --> 6814.259999999999
it with zero initial investment and that

6810.54 --> 6815.4
was years ago yeah still zero initial

6814.26 --> 6817.92
investment

6815.4 --> 6820.739
sounds like a scams the most profitable

6817.92 --> 6825.26
scam I've ever fell for

6820.739 --> 6825.259999999999
yeah been extremely profitable

6827.28 --> 6831.78
so yeah skirm yo well if you call like

6830.82 --> 6834.179
oh

6831.78 --> 6836.099999999999
take part in this you have to [ __ ]

6834.179 --> 6838.26
around on a computer for a while and

6836.1 --> 6840.780000000001
then you just you just can't get

6838.26 --> 6843.900000000001
hundreds of Euros if you call that a

6840.78 --> 6846.0599999999995
scam well yeah then it's a scam it's a

6843.9 --> 6849.0599999999995
scam you get involved you just get money

6846.06 --> 6851.88
what a scam yeah

6849.06 --> 6856.639
but you can't get it up yeah I can get

6851.88 --> 6856.639
it out that's the point I can

6857.4 --> 6864.54
I got like a thousand Euros worth

6860.639 --> 6867.54
of stuff in my wallet my

6864.54 --> 6869.88
crypto wallet right now

6867.54 --> 6872.719
a thousand Euros worth

6869.88 --> 6872.719
right now

6881.76 --> 6888.179
all I have to do is transform it into

6885.36 --> 6890.099999999999
another crypto that can actually be

6888.179 --> 6894.56
exchanged for

6890.1 --> 6894.56
money in the bank that's the difference

6898.34 --> 6903.4400000000005
would it cost something to cash your

6900.6 --> 6903.4400000000005
money out no

6904.26 --> 6908.1
I just need to get my hands on the right

6906.3 --> 6911.6990000000005
type of crypto

6908.1 --> 6914.34
and since it's not readily out there

6911.699 --> 6917.339999999999
trading all the time

6914.34 --> 6920.159000000001
with our like nobody's offering that

6917.34 --> 6922.619000000001
stuff for trade for our crypto

6920.159 --> 6925.32
for the GTI crypto

6922.619 --> 6927.42
if they would I would literally just buy

6925.32 --> 6929.699
it right now

6927.42 --> 6932.219
I would buy it for an excessive price

6929.699 --> 6934.0199999999995
it's like four times as expensive as

6932.219 --> 6936.659
normal yeah sure you know here you go

6934.02 --> 6940.92
because I only need just a little bit to

6936.659 --> 6942.9
start transforming my crypto into that

6940.92 --> 6945.9
with no cost

6942.9 --> 6948.179
yeah zero cost

6945.9 --> 6951.299999999999
no cost to get it out no cost to

6948.179 --> 6955.86
transfer no cost just money out of

6951.3 --> 6959.76
nothing just there no scam no fee no

6955.86 --> 6962.88
energy just money just there not a scam

6959.76 --> 6967.139
yeah zero in that investment

6962.88 --> 6969.4800000000005
massive profit zero cost no scam are you

6967.139 --> 6972.42
getting it yet are you getting it yet

6969.48 --> 6976.44
yeah not a scam getting money out of it

6972.42 --> 6979.56
no cost yeah no fees nothing

6976.44 --> 6982.199
money out of nothing it's just there it

6979.56 --> 6984.6
just works not a scam it didn't cost me

6982.199 --> 6986.879999999999
anything if just getting money out of

6984.6 --> 6989.04
nothing means it's a scam well then

6986.88 --> 6991.32
everything is a [ __ ] scam or rather

6989.04 --> 6994.76
no nothing is a scam because guess what

6991.32 --> 6998.46
there is no such thing out there

6994.76 --> 7001.9400000000005
yeah except for weird machines and [ __ ]

6998.46 --> 7003.56
trading machines that billionaires have

7001.94 --> 7006.08
yeah

7003.56 --> 7009.860000000001
you could say oh it's a scam yeah well

7006.08 --> 7013.78
it's a scam on you it's a scam on you

7009.86 --> 7013.78
for not using it yeah

7013.94 --> 7018.5599999999995
so you could say hey we're getting

7015.92 --> 7020.4800000000005
scammed by you using that then I'd say

7018.56 --> 7023.7390000000005
yeah fair enough

7020.48 --> 7023.739
you want in on it

7025.04 --> 7032.119
so

7026.96 --> 7035.42
why is it GTI giving away free money

7032.119 --> 7037.4
because it's yeah because

7035.42 --> 7039.26
you don't understand and I don't

7037.4 --> 7041.659
understand yeah they're not giving away

7039.26 --> 7043.3
money they're making they have been

7041.659 --> 7046.759999999999
making

7043.3 --> 7049.58
millions and hundreds of Millions on the

7046.76 --> 7052.159000000001
Forex Market using their original Bots

7049.58 --> 7055.04
high frequency trading Bots specifically

7052.159 --> 7058.0599999999995
designed for a GTI company to do that

7055.04 --> 7061.159
then they had a problem that they

7058.06 --> 7063.8
had a conspiracy of Bankers against them

7061.159 --> 7065.78
that basically would not allow them to

7063.8 --> 7067.88
actually withdraw that money because you

7065.78 --> 7069.699
still need a bank to do that they would

7067.88 --> 7073.88
just block them even though it was

7069.699 --> 7077.0
legally acquired money through trading

7073.88 --> 7078.9800000000005
on the Forex Market yeah and so to

7077.0 --> 7081.98
bypass all that

7078.98 --> 7085.879999999999
they had to create a cryptocurrency so

7081.98 --> 7087.678999999999
that legally acquired money in cash

7085.88 --> 7090.56
digitally

7087.679 --> 7094.88
could then be transformed into crypto

7090.56 --> 7097.46
and then be funneled in between all this

7094.88 --> 7100.159000000001
crypto craziness and then still be

7097.46 --> 7102.38
cached because the only reason it just

7100.159 --> 7104.36
cannot straightforward be cached at the

7102.38 --> 7106.88
banks is because all the banks has

7104.36 --> 7110.0
[ __ ] conspired to make that

7106.88 --> 7113.42
impossible because of Monopoly power

7110.0 --> 7116.3
yeah literally that

7113.42 --> 7118.46
that is exactly what is happening

7116.3 --> 7120.9800000000005
yeah

7118.46 --> 7123.26
they found a way to basically compete

7120.98 --> 7126.08
with the banker Monopoly the banker

7123.26 --> 7129.56
Monopoly did not take kindly to that and

7126.08 --> 7130.599
then just try to sabotage jti like a

7129.56 --> 7133.88
guild

7130.599 --> 7136.28
successfully and so they had to adapt

7133.88 --> 7139.159000000001
and transform

7136.28 --> 7142.219
in order to still be able to get that

7139.159 --> 7144.82
money out that was legally acquired

7142.219 --> 7144.82
yeah

7145.599 --> 7151.400000000001
maybe you're just a [ __ ] [ __ ] that

7148.52 --> 7154.040000000001
doesn't listen [ __ ] maybe it's just

7151.4 --> 7158.199
that maybe you're just [ __ ] [ __ ]

7154.04 --> 7158.199
and you don't listen to details

7164.3 --> 7169.58
exciting stuff yeah you're not exciting

7166.04 --> 7171.32
Jose you're the really cheap ass Market

7169.58 --> 7174.76
salesman

7171.32 --> 7174.759999999999

7179.0 --> 7183.58
for years what the [ __ ] are you talking

7181.28 --> 7183.58

I use it every day it does update for

7190.699 --> 7196.659
you it's why do you keep making up

7193.159 --> 7196.659
absolute horror [ __ ]

7234.739 --> 7239.138999999999
[ __ ] [ __ ]

7236.36 --> 7243.339999999999
what the [ __ ] are you warning me about

7239.139 --> 7248.179
I've been part of GTI since

7243.34 --> 7252.679
2015 with zero initial investment and

7248.179 --> 7257.92
600 euros of profit ever since what the

7252.679 --> 7257.92
[ __ ] are you warning me about you [ __ ]

7258.38 --> 7260.9800000000005
foreign

7287.32 --> 7292.42
I do have profit you [ __ ] [ __ ]

7293.679 --> 7298.52
I mean

7296.0 --> 7301.639
I I think I really have to get to the

7298.52 --> 7304.280000000001
point guys door Casey or are you actual

7301.639 --> 7307.28
people that I want to continue living

7304.28 --> 7309.38
right and not get tortured to death like

7307.28 --> 7310.699
those [ __ ] retards that are now sock

7309.38 --> 7312.38
trolling me

7310.699 --> 7313.58
I mean I guess I have to get to the

7312.38 --> 7316.159000000001
point

7313.58 --> 7319.099
of the point just like okay let's just

7316.159 --> 7321.0199999999995
cash a thousand Euros and I'll do it in

7319.099 --> 7323.2390000000005
paper and then throw it around maybe

7321.02 --> 7325.820000000001
I'll have to just throw around cash just

7323.239 --> 7328.04
to show no it's actually real this is

7325.82 --> 7330.5599999999995
real money I just got this real money

7328.04 --> 7332.06
right here it's real

7330.56 --> 7335.0
yeah

7332.06 --> 7335.900000000001
maybe I have to just show that at some

7335.0 --> 7338.06
point

7335.9 --> 7340.699
to prove it because these [ __ ] little

7338.06 --> 7342.56
[ __ ] trolls it just won't stop whining

7340.699 --> 7345.5599999999995
about it

7342.56 --> 7348.02
so how do you become part of GTI well

7345.56 --> 7349.76
you have to register

7348.02 --> 7352.219
you have to

7349.76 --> 7353.54
find somebody to hook up with the

7352.219 --> 7356.4800000000005
network

7353.54 --> 7358.42
and you get an account then you have to

7356.48 --> 7361.339999999999
do KCI

7358.42 --> 7363.56
kcy identification with your passport

7361.34 --> 7366.32
and your photo and all that it's quite a

7363.56 --> 7368.06
hassle to get in it's not easy

7366.32 --> 7370.34
but when you do

7368.06 --> 7373.52
then you get activated you have to have

7370.34 --> 7377.900000000001
an initial sum investment

7373.52 --> 7380.3
which would now be 500 euros I think

7377.9 --> 7382.04
you could do more if you want and then

7380.3 --> 7384.4400000000005
you grow quicker or you can have

7382.04 --> 7386.98
somebody basically throw a giant amount

7384.44 --> 7390.199
of those crypto tokens which it utilizes

7386.98 --> 7392.598999999999
to boost you up quicker

7390.199 --> 7396.0199999999995
if you can get somebody to give a [ __ ]

7392.599 --> 7397.159000000001
about that about you

7396.02 --> 7400.46
right

7397.159 --> 7402.379999999999
that's how you do it you hook up yeah

7400.46 --> 7404.619
and then you just become part of that

7402.38 --> 7404.619
system

7408.02 --> 7413.900000000001
and maybe Flat Earth going okay

7414.199 --> 7419.78
what does GTI it's just that's too bad

7417.739 --> 7420.86
I'm not gonna talk the show is already
