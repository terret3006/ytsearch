[Music]

144.239 --> 150.739
birds are just riding near up there

148.02 --> 150.739
a lot of them

160.86 --> 164.48000000000002
it's just beautiful day

183.06 --> 185.54
so

185.64 --> 194.89999999999998
it is Thursday the 2nd of March 2023

191.34 --> 194.9
starting pretty much on time

195.54 --> 201.659
and yeah I do feel great better than

198.959 --> 204.54
yesterday but that's because

201.659 --> 206.39999999999998
two days ago in the evening like I ate

204.54 --> 208.79999999999998
something that I normally

206.4 --> 212.94
don't

208.8 --> 214.8
but uh yeah a chicken broccoli yesterday

212.94 --> 217.98
it was kind of funny because oh it's

214.8 --> 219.9
over date because I that's an issue but

217.98 --> 223.459
I just like

219.9 --> 223.459
washed it off the chicken

224.459 --> 230.78
absolutely glorious

226.68 --> 230.78
like no problem whatsoever

233.12 --> 239.76
but I mean they package it pretty good

235.68 --> 242.28
like really vacuum tight plastic

239.76 --> 245.17999999999998

316.139 --> 322.08
I want feedback please somebody for the

319.68 --> 324.08
love of God

322.08 --> 324.08
um

331.36 --> 334.6
[Music]

335.6 --> 339.02000000000004
right anyway

340.32 --> 345.18
didn't actually watch my show back I

342.419 --> 348.5
wish I had actually but I I just it was

345.18 --> 348.5
other stuff I was watching

349.139 --> 356.36
the flatters the baits was really good

351.9 --> 356.35999999999996
and lasted life very long

357.479 --> 360.74
like a two-hour show

360.9 --> 363.56
again

367.56 --> 375.24
right also watch the bullet train

372.24 --> 379.34000000000003
which was a very interesting well-made

375.24 --> 379.34000000000003
movie it was enjoyable

379.979 --> 385.31899999999996
it's like it's sort of yeah anyway it's

382.979 --> 388.34
probably you're all very well familiar

385.319 --> 388.34000000000003
with that movie I bet

391.62 --> 395.759
but this was the first time that I've

393.539 --> 398.3
seen it

395.759 --> 398.3
anyway

400.5 --> 403.58
so watch that

404.18 --> 410.94
worked a little bit further um

407.88 --> 414.24
well there's Gate 3 script

410.94 --> 416.94
it's getting a little tough now

414.24 --> 419.34000000000003
but I'm I'm trying to work out a pattern

416.94 --> 421.8
to translate

419.34 --> 424.13899999999995
my idea is better

421.8 --> 426.72
basically making notes

424.139 --> 429.24
it's like

426.72 --> 432.44000000000005
a scenario

429.24 --> 434.759
and then finding a way to kind of

432.44 --> 436.86
effectively make a note about it that

434.759 --> 439.28000000000003
I'll still understand what it is

436.86 --> 442.02000000000004
that Vision

439.28 --> 444.31899999999996
in the future when I can kind of connect

442.02 --> 447.9
it up because I'm thinking about

444.319 --> 450.06
overstructure of the entire thing

447.9 --> 453.0
but

450.06 --> 456.419
filling it in is the challenge and

453.0 --> 460.319
that's where like the scenario flashes

456.419 --> 463.25899999999996
visions and all that come in for me

460.319 --> 465.84000000000003
in order to yeah try to fill in some

463.259 --> 468.47900000000004
kind of because it's all about like

465.84 --> 472.979
story and feel but yet

468.479 --> 475.62
without actually just writing it

472.979 --> 478.08
I'm just looking at moments moments of

475.62 --> 480.3
what could be a story basically that

478.08 --> 485.06
that's what it feels like

480.3 --> 485.06
but yeah creative juices are flowing

487.199 --> 491.28000000000003
in that sense

489.24 --> 493.979
although not as

491.28 --> 496.099
not as effectively as I would like it to

493.979 --> 496.099
be

499.62 --> 507.24
I just feel like doing stuff and like

503.639 --> 510.72
going places and I actually really want

507.24 --> 512.88
new pants I mean these things are like

510.72 --> 515.779
I mean they're almost literally falling

512.88 --> 515.779
apart at this point

517.08 --> 521.479
hello mystical rock kind of fossils good

519.06 --> 521.4789999999999
to see you

524.79 --> 531.0
[Music]

527.48 --> 532.98
cleaning up my email throwing away like

531.0 --> 537.0
[ __ ]

532.98 --> 540.1800000000001
keeping the actual contacts and all that

537.0 --> 542.519
I've been organizing so much since I

540.18 --> 545.3389999999999
stopped you drinking

542.519 --> 550.1
drinking beers I'm just

545.339 --> 550.1
or reorganizing and all that a lot

552.36 --> 555.5600000000001
that's really helpful

555.839 --> 561.5400000000001
right so technically for me now with the

558.12 --> 563.04
pants I think I could probably get it

561.54 --> 566.959
done

563.04 --> 566.959
but I still like need the money

568.519 --> 574.68
technically I could

571.26 --> 577.76
like try to sell some of those cards

574.68 --> 577.76
to get it done

578.459 --> 582.959
but before I engage I kind of want to

580.86 --> 585.66
make sure that that fabric that very

582.959 --> 588.1199999999999
specific type of fabric which I do still

585.66 --> 590.459
have some information on and know where

588.12 --> 593.16
I would be able to potentially get where

590.459 --> 595.1999999999999
we got it last time I have to somehow

593.16 --> 599.399
figure that out

595.2 --> 602.7
like if I can like contact

599.399 --> 604.98
that place and ask around and hopefully

602.7 --> 608.1600000000001
that will actually work

604.98 --> 611.04
and they'll not just be like not super

608.16 --> 612.8389999999999
Cooperative or well communicated forcing

611.04 --> 614.519
me to actually get over there because

612.839 --> 617.399
well

614.519 --> 620.72
you need like a certain type of

617.399 --> 620.72
license or whatever

621.0 --> 627.66
or you need to be part of like a

623.76 --> 631.08
merchant League of like clove makers or

627.66 --> 632.399
whatever seriously to even get in that

631.08 --> 637.399
store

632.399 --> 637.399
or you'd have to like pay you some to

637.44 --> 642.1800000000001
to get a membership thing and then you

640.26 --> 644.279
can be there for like a period of time

642.18 --> 646.3199999999999
but yeah I mean that's a huge fee for

644.279 --> 648.779
that I don't know I gotta I gotta figure

646.32 --> 652.339
it out again

648.779 --> 652.3389999999999
retrace the steps

653.279 --> 657.48
and see if it's still out there and like

655.56 --> 659.2199999999999
how much it would actually cost just for

657.48 --> 660.48
the fabric because once I have that

659.22 --> 662.88
fabric

660.48 --> 665.94
getting pants is going to be very little

662.88 --> 667.92
issue it's going to be very

665.94 --> 670.32
the least it's still about getting that

667.92 --> 672.56
fabric back because yeah the last time I

670.32 --> 672.5600000000001
tried

672.899 --> 678.0
the grace of my stepmother even like

674.88 --> 681.66
gave me that gift it's a birthday gift

678.0 --> 682.5
money to get pants made but then I I did

681.66 --> 685.38
that

682.5 --> 686.88
but the fabric I just got it from the

685.38 --> 689.04
local market

686.88 --> 691.64
and that was a big mistake because those

689.04 --> 691.64
things like

691.92 --> 698.2199999999999
like quickly changed color from black to

695.339 --> 701.4590000000001
Brown and

698.22 --> 705.12
and it and it started tearing

701.459 --> 710.06
like within a year of using it terrible

705.12 --> 710.0600000000001
so I gotta get that specific fabric back

712.019 --> 716.18
anyway

713.399 --> 719.64
don't know if this interests any of you

716.18 --> 721.26
but yeah it does interest me and I

719.64 --> 723.48
really want good pants back because

721.26 --> 727.56
these things are like

723.48 --> 729.48
I mean this is beyond hobo the hobos out

727.56 --> 732.3199999999999
there have better pants than I do I'm

729.48 --> 732.32
not even joking

733.68 --> 737.76
this is It's kind of awkward it's been

736.019 --> 739.32
like that for a while now it's very

737.76 --> 741.42
effective

739.32 --> 744.5600000000001
wearing the jacket which is by the way

741.42 --> 744.56
also kind of worn

746.22 --> 753.48
but it is basically covering the damage

749.94 --> 755.399
on my pants so nobody notices

753.48 --> 758.72
and I mean

755.399 --> 758.72
it's not bothering me

761.16 --> 766.139
but I mean if I'm gonna be like walking

763.44 --> 768.24
around without my jacket on it I just

766.139 --> 770.4590000000001
look like a freak

768.24 --> 772.139
if you look down if you actually have

770.459 --> 774.3
the if you have good eyes if you don't

772.139 --> 776.16
have good eyes you're probably just

774.3 --> 778.1999999999999
gonna see my face and that the rest is

776.16 --> 781.579
black that's all

778.2 --> 781.5790000000001
but uh yeah

788.82 --> 793.2600000000001
so I'm wondering should I start a

791.16 --> 795.36
GoFundMe I mean Nathan's been starting

793.26 --> 798.0
gofundme's

795.36 --> 799.92
and I mean getting these new pens will

798.0 --> 801.48
certainly do a great job on my

799.92 --> 805.74
confidence

801.48 --> 808.019
and a social range because it has

805.74 --> 810.54
actually I have to say honestly it's

808.019 --> 814.139
been obstructing me from socializing

810.54 --> 817.38
from getting in buildings with people

814.139 --> 821.0600000000001
taking your jacket off

817.38 --> 821.06
because then I look like an ass

821.82 --> 825.019
and I don't want that

825.36 --> 831.44
I got I once got called

828.54 --> 831.4399999999999
parachute pants

831.839 --> 837.86
that's

834.12 --> 837.86
that's kind of funny I guess

839.339 --> 844.3800000000001
they might call me that

841.5 --> 846.139
it's just that

844.38 --> 850.56
I could

846.139 --> 852.54
just do it anyway and be like yeah just

850.56 --> 855.66
like show how

852.54 --> 858.139
I basically can force myself to not give

855.66 --> 858.139
a [ __ ]

859.5 --> 862.16
but

862.74 --> 866.839
it's just annoying as well

866.88 --> 874.4399999999999
I just want good pants back

870.48 --> 878.519
and they're going to look very modest

874.44 --> 879.839
basically black but it has to be that

878.519 --> 882.48
fabric

879.839 --> 883.98
I really hope that it still exists

882.48 --> 885.9590000000001
somewhere I mean it was really good

883.98 --> 888.779
fabric I mean I wouldn't know why they

885.959 --> 891.5999999999999
would stop producing it maybe there's

888.779 --> 894.5
even a better version of it that would

891.6 --> 894.5
be even more awesome

895.8 --> 901.0999999999999
so I'm gonna try to do some

898.38 --> 901.1
investigation

901.139 --> 906.54
I'm kind of nervous about it

904.139 --> 910.38
but that's because like

906.54 --> 912.8389999999999
could be really good also and I'm like

910.38 --> 915.6
usually I'm more scared when the result

912.839 --> 919.5790000000001
could be really good

915.6 --> 919.5790000000001
because then I'd have to handle that

919.98 --> 925.8000000000001
I've had to handle suddenly My World

922.74 --> 929.9590000000001
opening up a bit more and that

925.8 --> 929.959
on the intuitive level is a little scary

930.72 --> 936.36
not that I've been there before it's

933.36 --> 938.6990000000001
just that when I was there it was with a

936.36 --> 941.1
very different type of Route setting

938.699 --> 943.56
then if I would do now I don't know what

941.1 --> 945.839
it's going to be like exactly

943.56 --> 948.6199999999999
talking spiritual

945.839 --> 948.62
that's a physical

951.24 --> 954.6
because my spirit was very different

953.279 --> 957.86
like

954.6 --> 957.86
15 years ago

961.62 --> 967.38
my

964.079 --> 971.9399999999999
story was different as to like what I

967.38 --> 974.22
was now I'm much more like focused on

971.94 --> 976.019
everything that's preceded

974.22 --> 979.6800000000001
back then

976.019 --> 981.779
that was pretty much

979.68 --> 985.8599999999999
not the case

981.779 --> 988.92
it was from 17 and up

985.86 --> 992.1
that I viewed everything and

988.92 --> 992.9399999999999
I glorified it in a kind of superficial

992.1 --> 998.399
way

992.94 --> 1000.44
because I hated when I was like younger

998.399 --> 1003.86
and I really saw it as like that's when

1000.44 --> 1006.3800000000001
I finally got out of that childishness

1003.86 --> 1009.399
even though I'd never really lost it and

1006.38 --> 1009.399
I just suppressed it

1010.519 --> 1015.98
and that really changes the way you come

1013.759 --> 1018.16
across

1015.98 --> 1018.16
foreign

1020.62 --> 1027.86
can you imagine I'm more loose

1024.28 --> 1029.6
am I loose or am I really tight I wonder

1027.86 --> 1033.52
sometimes

1029.6 --> 1033.52
I mean I can be really strict

1035.78 --> 1041.72
but I mean I also like to give people

1038.839 --> 1043.76
room for just sensitive expressions and

1041.72 --> 1047.1200000000001
all that

1043.76 --> 1051.16
so it's a bit of both I guess anyway

1047.12 --> 1051.1599999999999
right anybody's still following

1055.79 --> 1059.6
[Music]

1056.96 --> 1061.46
okay

1059.6 --> 1063.32
all right hope you are I hope you are

1061.46 --> 1066.08
having great weather too

1063.32 --> 1067.82
or is it still freezing in the United

1066.08 --> 1069.98
States

1067.82 --> 1073.4189999999999
I don't know but I mean I'm really

1069.98 --> 1073.419
feeling the spring energy here

1082.7 --> 1086.72
and it's so funny man even at night

1084.62 --> 1089.6599999999999
there's like birds

1086.72 --> 1092.24
there's like these honking

1089.66 --> 1095.179
birds that go off at night

1092.24 --> 1098.24
and there's owls and they really like

1095.179 --> 1101.96
those owls like I think

1098.24 --> 1105.559
they sit in basically the trees that are

1101.96 --> 1109.64
directly here surrounding this building

1105.559 --> 1116.08
because it's very audible every time

1109.64 --> 1116.0800000000002
it gets really close to to do its thing

1125.6 --> 1127.9599999999998
thank you

1136.299 --> 1140.08
what's going on guys

1148.039 --> 1152.78
are you all kind of sleepy or something

1150.38 --> 1155.5590000000002
or you knuckle Womble shouldn't be

1152.78 --> 1155.559
he's in England

1158.179 --> 1163.0590000000002
so what's what's going on here guys

1178.46 --> 1184.72
yeah kind of working okay typical

1182.0 --> 1184.72
all right

1186.29 --> 1192.1399999999999
[Music]

1188.66 --> 1196.1000000000001
well let me be your radio then

1192.14 --> 1199.5200000000002
I'll just keep you busy until then cause

1196.1 --> 1201.799
I am the radio show now apparently

1199.52 --> 1203.66
it's no longer a workshop well it's a

1201.799 --> 1206.0
workshop for you guys you're working and

1203.66 --> 1209.5
I'm the radio I guess okay I don't know

1206.0 --> 1209.5
why I'm being complaining about this

1238.34 --> 1241.1789999999999
foreign

1243.86 --> 1247.1599999999999
course

1245.6 --> 1248.6
I think I could do it another way

1247.16 --> 1251.6200000000001
potentially

1248.6 --> 1251.62
hey pigeon

1254.08 --> 1258.08
but

1255.679 --> 1260.6000000000001
I'm yeah I mean I'm just thinking back

1258.08 --> 1264.62
about my pants and all that

1260.6 --> 1266.84
there's this really nice nice and tidy

1264.62 --> 1270.02
store and

1266.84 --> 1272.26
where I get like glued to shoot my glues

1270.02 --> 1275.539
back together and all that

1272.26 --> 1277.94
seriously and other things they have

1275.539 --> 1279.86
like the knitting store

1277.94 --> 1282.44
but they also have Fabric and I'm

1279.86 --> 1284.6
wondering like maybe I could talk to

1282.44 --> 1286.52
them

1284.6 --> 1289.6599999999999
it's a really nice ladies there and I

1286.52 --> 1289.66
think that they kind of like me

1290.059 --> 1294.02
so that's always a good thing which is

1292.28 --> 1297.44
weird by the way because when I first

1294.02 --> 1299.78
got there when I kind of like

1297.44 --> 1302.179
first few years that I was in Utrecht

1299.78 --> 1303.9189999999999
like I guess that I had a really bad

1302.179 --> 1306.26
Vibe on me because they were kind of

1303.919 --> 1307.76
like who is that

1306.26 --> 1310.46
but now

1307.76 --> 1314.24
they seem to like appreciate my presence

1310.46 --> 1316.28
that's really nice I and I appreciate I

1314.24 --> 1318.799
feel I like being appreciated when I

1316.28 --> 1320.84
just come in somewhere so but I might go

1318.799 --> 1322.94
to them and basically put it down like

1320.84 --> 1325.36
hey this is very specific fabric I had

1322.94 --> 1325.3600000000001
from

1325.52 --> 1329.799
this location base

1329.9 --> 1335.419
in a warehouse and it was called this

1332.84 --> 1337.8799999999999
like could you help me out like I really

1335.419 --> 1341.48
need that fabric

1337.88 --> 1343.2800000000002
and if you could then I would also like

1341.48 --> 1344.78
to tailor anybody that you would

1343.28 --> 1348.02
recommend

1344.78 --> 1350.1789999999999
like that and that could be them could

1348.02 --> 1353.48
be like somebody that they know that

1350.179 --> 1354.3200000000002
really needed it a job that's for for I

1353.48 --> 1356.539
don't know

1354.32 --> 1358.46
I don't know what would happen but I

1356.539 --> 1361.419
think that would be a good place to to

1358.46 --> 1361.419
start contacting

1361.94 --> 1365.96
and if that doesn't work then I have to

1364.4 --> 1369.26
like

1365.96 --> 1372.6200000000001
Go Phone hunting

1369.26 --> 1375.08
see if I can do it that way

1372.62 --> 1377.4189999999999
or maybe they'll they'll tell me like oh

1375.08 --> 1381.86
yeah here's the number

1377.419 --> 1384.98
you can ask them or maybe they'll do it

1381.86 --> 1386.9599999999998
they'll call up and then they'll ask I I

1384.98 --> 1389.179
don't know what's but I that's a good

1386.96 --> 1391.659
point to start

1389.179 --> 1391.659
right

1393.5 --> 1397.539
it's nice survival pants

1400.58 --> 1405.86
what does that mean

1402.32 --> 1408.9189999999999
survival events but basically my pants

1405.86 --> 1412.58
are like survival pants I mean

1408.919 --> 1415.539
they're raggedy now but this pair

1412.58 --> 1415.539
is like

1416.6 --> 1422.539
15 years old that I

1419.72 --> 1424.159
yeah here comes the crazy part

1422.539 --> 1428.24
two

1424.159 --> 1431.419
pair worn every day

1428.24 --> 1433.88
for 15 years it's a miracle that it's

1431.419 --> 1436.6000000000001
not completely just disintegrated

1433.88 --> 1436.6000000000001
entirely

1438.62 --> 1443.36
uh

1440.72 --> 1447.76
the material used for sat balloons is

1443.36 --> 1447.76
good well no I don't think so

1447.86 --> 1452.7199999999998
because those satelloon material I mean

1450.32 --> 1455.8999999999999
the set loans are not

1452.72 --> 1459.44
they're meant for stretchability not for

1455.9 --> 1461.539
friction yeah pants need to I know I'm

1459.44 --> 1463.46
taking it super literal the joke I know

1461.539 --> 1466.82
it's my thing yeah

1463.46 --> 1469.22
fabric of a balloon has to be super

1466.82 --> 1472.82
stretchable and able to take pressures

1469.22 --> 1476.539
right but I mean it's not

1472.82 --> 1478.8799999999999
meant for like things rubbing over it

1476.539 --> 1481.1
with the surface like scraping away at

1478.88 --> 1484.1000000000001
it or piercing it it's going to be gone

1481.1 --> 1487.1589999999999
very quickly right pants have to be like

1484.1 --> 1491.059
durable frictional that it just refuses

1487.159 --> 1493.64
to tear refuses to disintegrate

1491.059 --> 1496.34
that's this fabric

1493.64 --> 1498.5
pantaloons

1496.34 --> 1500.86
alrighty then

1498.5 --> 1505.78
hey jado

1500.86 --> 1505.78
good to see you NLO classical homeopath

1507.559 --> 1512.26
DJ one deck house music good to see you

1518.78 --> 1522.46
right so this is what I'm gonna do

1525.14 --> 1529.4
I don't know if it's going to be today

1526.4 --> 1532.46
or in a weekend or where

1529.4 --> 1534.5
somewhere in the next week or so I'm

1532.46 --> 1537.08
gonna go there I'm gonna ask then I'm

1534.5 --> 1539.799
gonna find out how much it will cost to

1537.08 --> 1539.799
get that fabric

1542.659 --> 1548.48
and then I will basically estimate a

1544.88 --> 1552.0390000000002
price and then announce a GoFundMe to

1548.48 --> 1552.039
get it that's what I'm gonna do

1568.039 --> 1572.96
I might even get silly and call it the

1570.38 --> 1574.64
Fancy Pants fund or something

1572.96 --> 1576.08
I mean they're going to be pretty no

1574.64 --> 1578.2990000000002
they're not going to be fancy looking

1576.08 --> 1580.3999999999999
but they're gonna they're gonna be

1578.299 --> 1583.84
actually fancy even though they will

1580.4 --> 1583.8400000000001
look like yeah it's just pants

1583.88 --> 1589.1000000000001
yeah but these are like Immortal pants

1586.64 --> 1590.96
not really though but

1589.1 --> 1592.3999999999999
just the ones that I'm wearing proof

1590.96 --> 1593.299
unfortunately I wish they would have

1592.4 --> 1596.0590000000002
been

1593.299 --> 1598.82
that would have been epic

1596.059 --> 1602.12
like pass that can never tear

1598.82 --> 1603.62
that would be epic but uh yeah

1602.12 --> 1606.559
thank you

1603.62 --> 1608.36
I wanted I've been wanting it for a long

1606.559 --> 1610.3999999999999
time I've just been kind of Getting By

1608.36 --> 1612.74
it's like oh yeah but I'm poor and so

1610.4 --> 1615.94
it'll just symbolize my poverty yeah I'm

1612.74 --> 1615.94
so freaking done with that

1618.86 --> 1622.59
um

1619.35 --> 1622.59
[Music]

1645.279 --> 1649.12
original jeans

1649.88 --> 1655.279
yeah but I don't like that fabric

1653.24 --> 1657.58
denim is it that's what it's called

1655.279 --> 1657.58
right

1657.98 --> 1664.58
I don't like it I mean I could wear it

1661.88 --> 1667.3400000000001
I mean it's if I'd like to outdoor

1664.58 --> 1669.1999999999998
things like working in the garden for a

1667.34 --> 1671.1789999999999
long period yeah then I'd probably wear

1669.2 --> 1673.5800000000002
denim

1671.179 --> 1675.3200000000002
if I ever do that I'd get it

1673.58 --> 1677.84
pair

1675.32 --> 1680.12
specifically for that

1677.84 --> 1682.6
but in general I don't like wearing

1680.12 --> 1682.6
those things

1685.1 --> 1691.1789999999999
I like a little bit more smooth fabric

1687.32 --> 1691.1789999999999
but it's got to be super durable

1694.46 --> 1700.88
right I I'm not gonna settle for like

1697.58 --> 1703.1589999999999
cheap ass fabric that like women just

1700.88 --> 1705.74
love to quickly just make something it's

1703.159 --> 1708.0200000000002
like oh so nice and then like they wear

1705.74 --> 1710.6
it for like a week and then

1708.02 --> 1713.02
kind of forget about it like that's not

1710.6 --> 1713.02
gonna work

1713.24 --> 1718.24
I'm gonna be wearing it every freaking

1715.94 --> 1718.24
day

1718.4 --> 1721.4
anyway

1722.86 --> 1729.74
hiking pants that sounds yeah

1726.26 --> 1733.46
because I think that the material

1729.74 --> 1736.179
was called work wear at the time the

1733.46 --> 1736.179
fabric

1736.46 --> 1742.76
that's like 15 years ago or something

1739.34 --> 1745.76
it was also used for like military

1742.76 --> 1745.76
uniforms

1745.82 --> 1748.0
foreign

1749.96 --> 1755.3600000000001
like that's what the fabric was being

1751.82 --> 1759.62
like I really wanted that standard

1755.36 --> 1762.02
like the best just the best

1759.62 --> 1764.36
so if the fabric is kind of expensive

1762.02 --> 1766.94
it's it's gonna be like I don't know

1764.36 --> 1768.02
three five times as expensive as regular

1766.94 --> 1770.1200000000001
fabric

1768.02 --> 1773.179
but I mean

1770.12 --> 1775.34
yeah oh no my pants will be one and a

1773.179 --> 1776.8990000000001
half times as expensive when I have it

1775.34 --> 1779.059
made like that

1776.899 --> 1781.2199999999998
but it'll last like

1779.059 --> 1783.1399999999999
10 times longer

1781.22 --> 1786.94
yeah

1783.14 --> 1786.94
seems like worth it

1791.179 --> 1793.72
ah

1795.559 --> 1801.08
Hardy Fabrics well yeah though except

1799.34 --> 1803.36
for this one

1801.08 --> 1806.1399999999999
except this one that was the awesome

1803.36 --> 1806.1399999999999
thing about it

1806.36 --> 1811.039
I mean look

1808.34 --> 1813.02
let's just say that at some point I

1811.039 --> 1814.52
actually get a house with a garden and

1813.02 --> 1818.0
all that and I'm gonna be doing Garden

1814.52 --> 1819.86
work yeah I'm gonna get a pair of jeans

1818.0 --> 1821.0
for that something

1819.86 --> 1823.9399999999998
right

1821.0 --> 1826.46
I will I will do that not gonna do that

1823.94 --> 1829.1000000000001
now because that's not gonna happen

1826.46 --> 1830.96
at this point there's no point in me

1829.1 --> 1833.98
just spending money on something that

1830.96 --> 1833.98
I'm not really going to use

1837.799 --> 1841.96
just don't put any weight on what

1849.02 --> 1853.299
no that's been absolutely no problem

1853.64 --> 1859.64
you can dude you can even design your

1856.7 --> 1862.419
pants to be dynamic like that

1859.64 --> 1862.419
serious

1863.12 --> 1869.299
I mean tailors are kind of like

1865.34 --> 1872.6599999999999
Engineers you know of clothing and they

1869.299 --> 1874.58
they know Nifty tricks sometimes

1872.66 --> 1876.799
[Music]

1874.58 --> 1878.12
I spend money on [ __ ] I don't use all

1876.799 --> 1881.48
the time wow

1878.12 --> 1883.399
that's a waste then I don't I try to

1881.48 --> 1885.08
avoid that at all costs I hate it when

1883.399 --> 1886.58
it turns out I bought something and it's

1885.08 --> 1889.46
like oh it felt so great and then it's

1886.58 --> 1890.539
like oh man I totally didn't know what I

1889.46 --> 1892.46
was thinking

1890.539 --> 1895.899
never going to use that and that makes

1892.46 --> 1895.8990000000001
me feel really stupid

1895.94 --> 1900.64
but that's just me

[Music]

1969.32 --> 1972.76

more wealthy people like they really

1975.559 --> 1978.98
have their own Tailors and all that

1977.24 --> 1981.26
because

1978.98 --> 1983.419
a good tailor like can be a huge

1981.26 --> 1988.0
difference in just how you can come

1983.419 --> 1988.0
across as I know by experience

2013.36 --> 2020.039

2039.82 --> 2044.5
like bedazzling Panzer that's yeah

2042.279 --> 2047.44
that's gay

2044.5 --> 2051.22
but I mean my pants were pretty damn

2047.44 --> 2054.04
fancy it's just they weren't gay fancy

2051.22 --> 2056.6389999999997
they were just like uber pants they'll

2054.04 --> 2056.639
last forever

2057.159 --> 2060.78
and that are really comfortable

2065.399 --> 2070.0
shout out to Owen Benjamin oh yeah by

2068.08 --> 2072.54

at an authorized.tv

2076.78 --> 2082.8390000000004
noticed how incredibly fast the video

2080.919 --> 2084.879
there works

2082.839 --> 2086.56
I mean you click it and it immediately

2084.879 --> 2088.659
starts playing with [ __ ] you they

2086.56 --> 2090.879
usually have to wait like a minute

2088.659 --> 2092.859
so it's been very smooth little bit

2090.879 --> 2095.2599999999998
issues with like

2092.859 --> 2096.94
yesterday's upload a recent upload that

I noticed this morning

2096.94 --> 2100.5
it had some hiccups there

2101.619 --> 2104.619
but I mean I'm pretty sure that's gonna

2103.3 --> 2107.2200000000003
be gone it's going to be super smooth

gonna keep checking it out very happy

2109.78 --> 2112.96

2111.339 --> 2115.42
a long time ago but it felt like it

2112.96 --> 2118.5
couldn't it could never

2115.42 --> 2118.5
afford it

2122.5 --> 2127.32

2135.28 --> 2139.9
no no never been a big fan of that I

2138.46 --> 2142.48
appreciate

2139.9 --> 2145.6600000000003
that it is a thing

2142.48 --> 2148.92
and I mean hemp would be great for like

2145.66 --> 2148.92
industrial fabric

2150.76 --> 2158.1400000000003
right like sax for things like sacks of

2154.72 --> 2162.0
sand or like for industrial fabric

2158.14 --> 2162.0
requirements yeah hemp great

2162.7 --> 2168.339
but I don't like clothing of that I

2165.579 --> 2170.5600000000004
don't like that on my skin

2168.339 --> 2173.68
I have absolute respect for people that

2170.56 --> 2175.54
that are fine with it unless they're

2173.68 --> 2177.94
crazy

2175.54 --> 2180.52
vegan hippies that are malnatra

2177.94 --> 2184.02
malnutrition

2180.52 --> 2184.02
and all that but uh

2189.22 --> 2195.339
but yeah I mean hemp clothing sure

2192.88 --> 2197.8
that's cool

2195.339 --> 2200.0789999999997
and who knows man where if they can

2197.8 --> 2203.619
develop it even more refined and better

2200.079 --> 2206.26
etc etc then I'm all for it

2203.619 --> 2211.5
just in my experience I don't really

2206.26 --> 2211.5
like hemp that much as clothing

2213.42 --> 2219.46
vs gimbap any developments

2217.3 --> 2222.28
uh

2219.46 --> 2223.839
uh development I don't know how Owen is

2222.28 --> 2225.7000000000003
just crushing it

2223.839 --> 2227.619
and he keeps

2225.7 --> 2230.0789999999997
we're hiding on the same joke but I mean

2227.619 --> 2232.9
he's like the inspiration

2230.079 --> 2234.82
I mean Jim Bob's the energy Jim Bob of

2232.9 --> 2236.6800000000003
the situation what he's doing

2234.82 --> 2238.1800000000003
for Owen is getting kind of depleted

2236.68 --> 2240.94
it's just getting annoying it's getting

2238.18 --> 2243.04
tedious Jim Bob is getting tedious he's

2240.94 --> 2246.7200000000003
completely spiraling

2243.04 --> 2246.72
I don't I can't watch it anymore

2246.82 --> 2252.6400000000003
like the energy is completely flipped

2248.8 --> 2256.0600000000004
around it's not pleasant there at all

2252.64 --> 2259.18
and Gammas are out of control

2256.06 --> 2261.52
it's turned into total savonia nonsense

2259.18 --> 2265.06
stream and I don't watch it

2261.52 --> 2267.7599999999998
I like yeah I mean I think I might

2265.06 --> 2269.74
unsubscribe soon but I'm not checking it

2267.76 --> 2272.5600000000004
out anymore at least

2269.74 --> 2274.72
I'm kind of waiting for a sign that is

2272.56 --> 2275.92
finally getting back to normal although

2274.72 --> 2278.5
I don't think that's actually gonna

2275.92 --> 2280.119
happen I think it really like a a ranty

2278.5 --> 2284.28
turn moment

2280.119 --> 2284.28
that just happened I really think it has

2285.04 --> 2288.66
and there's no way back from that

2288.7 --> 2293.9199999999996
so ranty

2290.7 --> 2296.04
Jimbo I think is really screwed like

2293.92 --> 2302.04
really screwed

2296.04 --> 2302.04
and he's completely done it to himself

2302.8 --> 2309.88
all we had to do is just not let the

2306.579 --> 2313.2400000000002
gamma out but he did it and now it's

2309.88 --> 2315.6400000000003
done there's no way back after July to

2313.24 --> 2319.06
get my genie out of your bottle

2315.64 --> 2321.04
life it's over

2319.06 --> 2323.7999999999997
everything you've done before that's all

2321.04 --> 2326.38
broken in that one moment

2323.8 --> 2328.96
and you have to like work hard to get it

2326.38 --> 2331.06
back even if you can

2328.96 --> 2333.04
and he doesn't seem to be able to so

2331.06 --> 2334.52
it's just completely [ __ ]

2333.04 --> 2338.92
okay

2334.52 --> 2338.92
[Music]

2342.099 --> 2346.7200000000003
although some of his jokes are funny

2344.44 --> 2349.06
yeah they don't seem really funny to me

2346.72 --> 2350.9199999999996
at all now

2349.06 --> 2353.2
like everything he does is super

2350.92 --> 2355.96
hypocritical

2353.2 --> 2358.24
like even him making fun of the deep

2355.96 --> 2360.64
fake characters is just like yeah Jim

2358.24 --> 2364.2
Bob oh it's so funny to you oh yeah but

2360.64 --> 2364.2
you also do that

2364.66 --> 2369.22
when you're not

2366.099 --> 2370.1800000000003
being silly you do that so it's not

2369.22 --> 2373.6189999999997
funny

2370.18 --> 2373.6189999999997
it's just hypocritical

2376.42 --> 2380.94
so I just can't enjoy Jim Bob anymore

2381.579 --> 2384.599
he's ruined it

2403.3 --> 2409.02
I mean I'm not gonna like burn his book

2405.4 --> 2409.02
or anything like Jim Bob

2409.42 --> 2413.7000000000003
that that he gave me I'm not gonna do

2411.46 --> 2413.7
that

2414.4 --> 2418.9
but I had hoped

2416.68 --> 2421.4199999999996
to basically make somebody really happy

2418.9 --> 2425.44
with that at some point

2421.42 --> 2427.54
but now that's not gonna really be

2425.44 --> 2429.64
possible anymore

2427.54 --> 2432.0
so it's just like yeah now it's just an

2429.64 --> 2432.0
old book

2438.06 --> 2445.14
yeah I know LSG I know I got that far in

2442.839 --> 2445.14

2447.119 --> 2453.96

tuned

2467.56 --> 2474.2999999999997
that's weird yeah though no I don't have

2470.32 --> 2474.3
that at all I have quite the opposite

2482.14 --> 2486.2799999999997
but I mean

2484.24 --> 2489.8799999999997
he is

2486.28 --> 2493.3590000000004
being a Bard he also is kind of an

2489.88 --> 2495.1800000000003
empath that has extensive feelings and

2493.359 --> 2499.56
sometimes like yeah

2495.18 --> 2502.72
he's very busy he has compressed issues

2499.56 --> 2504.2799999999997
sometimes weird things also come out a

2502.72 --> 2506.5
bit

2504.28 --> 2509.6400000000003
but I mean that happens with me and I'm

2506.5 --> 2509.64
not even really busy

2510.579 --> 2517.6600000000003
that busy like him so

2514.48 --> 2519.579
I know yeah maybe you just don't like it

2517.66 --> 2520.8999999999996
right if you just don't like it then

2519.579 --> 2523.9
yeah

2520.9 --> 2527.88
what can you do I really like Owen

2523.9 --> 2527.88
Benjamin and what he does I really do

2543.16 --> 2549.24
the traces his memes from existing memes

2546.339 --> 2549.24
oh [ __ ]

2550.18 --> 2556.4199999999996
why he said that did he actually show

2553.0 --> 2560.16
that I haven't gotten that far yet LSG

2556.42 --> 2560.16
I'm like was it

2560.38 --> 2566.7090000000003

I mean if it works it works it's just

2657.64 --> 2660.72
that's what he does

2663.04 --> 2665.7
show an actual

2666.76 --> 2669.3590000000004
actual okay

2676.119 --> 2682.38
okay well LG I'll get to that

2705.76 --> 2710.4

2717.04 --> 2722.5
Alex steinen Oh Benjamin had like I

2720.099 --> 2727.2400000000002
think they've been they have done like

2722.5 --> 2730.24
uh appearances together like on video

2727.24 --> 2732.4599999999996
if I remember correctly

2730.24 --> 2736.859
but I think that they're technically

2732.46 --> 2736.859
friends although yeah I don't know

2737.26 --> 2740.4
might have changed

2742.06 --> 2747.5589999999997

2744.42 --> 2747.559
[Music]

2769.119 --> 2773.6400000000003
they remind you of each other what

Alex Stein reminds you of Owen Benjamin

2776.74 --> 2781.54
and vice versa

2779.079 --> 2783.04
what

2781.54 --> 2786.24
how

2783.04 --> 2786.24
they're nothing alike

2795.54 --> 2801.96
I like steinist is chilliest [ __ ] yeah

2798.579 --> 2801.96
but that's his joke though

2803.92 --> 2810.099
is like all in with the Enemy and then

2806.98 --> 2812.68
becomes more fanatical and effective he

2810.099 --> 2815.7400000000002
like in a way kind of like does what I

2812.68 --> 2818.319
do with Baldwin except that I don't

2815.74 --> 2821.16
throw it all out there and go nuts and

2818.319 --> 2821.16
silly over it

2821.92 --> 2829.14
keep it under control

2824.2 --> 2829.14
but he does that with a lot of things

2829.48 --> 2835.92
just put on the enemy's skin and and

2831.76 --> 2835.92
make a a really bizarre scene

2838.599 --> 2841.44
laughs

2842.819 --> 2847.5
I mean how is he a shell

2848.8 --> 2852.0600000000004
explain that to me

2853.42 --> 2856.6800000000003
who is he Shilling for

2860.5 --> 2866.4
similar underlying personality

2863.04 --> 2866.4
absolutely not

2877.06 --> 2881.14
narrative is that he's going to

2878.98 --> 2883.599
infiltrate the enemy yeah no but he's

2881.14 --> 2887.5
not it's not a narrative classical

2883.599 --> 2889.7400000000002
homeopath he is actually doing that on

2887.5 --> 2889.74
camera

2891.94 --> 2894.94
foreign

2900.099 --> 2905.92
like how he gets in the city hall and

2902.38 --> 2909.3
all that does all these crazy speeches

2905.92 --> 2909.3
that's what that is

2910.06 --> 2915.22
and that is actually weirdly enough it

2912.64 --> 2919.2999999999997
has an influence

2915.22 --> 2921.4599999999996
he's playing their game

2919.3 --> 2923.5600000000004
but in the open it's not like he's

2921.46 --> 2925.66
always secret it's like keeping a secret

2923.56 --> 2927.16
conspiracy with the guys to try and

2925.66 --> 2930.46
influence no it's not like that at all

2927.16 --> 2932.14
he's doing everything as he does is open

2930.46 --> 2935.44
so I don't know where you're getting

2932.14 --> 2937.74
that from like why the animosity I don't

2935.44 --> 2937.7400000000002
get it

2969.46 --> 2972.359
to understand why

2974.26 --> 2978.4
I mean hey if you don't like him or

2976.24 --> 2979.839
whatever or you get a bad Vibe you don't

2978.4 --> 2982.6600000000003
trust them you don't feel comfortable

2979.839 --> 2985.54
with him hey that's

2982.66 --> 2988.56
okay if you feel like that that's fine I

2985.54 --> 2988.56

3015.18 --> 3020.3999999999996
yeah that's so how are they the same

3018.24 --> 3024.1189999999997
they don't even they don't have the same

3020.4 --> 3026.2200000000003
person that they don't have the same gig

3024.119 --> 3027.9
it's like they're different I mean

3026.22 --> 3029.7
they're different in every freaking way

3027.9 --> 3032.3
if you put them together you're like

3029.7 --> 3034.98
they are different

3032.3 --> 3037.98
they're very very different I don't see

3034.98 --> 3041.099
why you see oh yeah Alex Stein is just

3037.98 --> 3044.42
like Owen Benjamin like what what the

3041.099 --> 3044.42
[ __ ] are you talking about

3045.8 --> 3052.079
I mean I could barely imagine two people

3049.02 --> 3054.599
being more opposite in every single way

3052.079 --> 3057.7400000000002
they they compose themselves

3054.599 --> 3057.7400000000002
like what the hell

3058.819 --> 3064.2
even in your example classical homeopath

3061.859 --> 3067.74
or no way jedo

3064.2 --> 3070.2599999999998
it's like oh yes they share this

3067.74 --> 3072.1189999999997
but in completely different ways yeah

3070.26 --> 3075.3
yeah that's the point yeah they're

3072.119 --> 3078.1400000000003
completely different in every way pretty

3075.3 --> 3082.5
much on every level creativity

3078.14 --> 3084.42
personality social strategy

3082.5 --> 3088.339
everything

3084.42 --> 3091.859
they're nothing alike at all

3088.339 --> 3093.119
except that they're both tackling sacred

3091.859 --> 3094.2
cows

3093.119 --> 3096.54
yeah

3094.2 --> 3098.9399999999996
that's it that's about like the

3096.54 --> 3101.7
similarity

3098.94 --> 3103.319
I don't see much many more similarities

3101.7 --> 3105.359
really

3103.319 --> 3107.339
I mean they even look completely there

3105.359 --> 3110.24
it's the everything about them is

3107.339 --> 3110.24
completely different

3110.52 --> 3120.18
[Music]

3116.88 --> 3123.26
like everything everything about them is

3120.18 --> 3123.2599999999998
different I don't get it

3138.059 --> 3142.6800000000003
that's dirt rather and the twin like

3141.119 --> 3143.819
they're twins

3142.68 --> 3145.319
no

3143.819 --> 3148.68
I mean

3145.319 --> 3150.3
they have similar missions

3148.68 --> 3151.98
and they resonate because of that

3150.3 --> 3154.6800000000003
because they're basically brothers in

3151.98 --> 3156.98
arms like that even on the spiritual

3154.68 --> 3156.98
level

3157.2 --> 3164.16
but as people and as what they do and

3162.0 --> 3167.579
how they look even

3164.16 --> 3169.2799999999997
everything about them is completely

3167.579 --> 3172.92
different

3169.28 --> 3175.26
completely different come on can't you

3172.92 --> 3178.44
see it

3175.26 --> 3181.5
everything the way they talk what they

3178.44 --> 3184.8
talk about how their comedy is

3181.5 --> 3185.78
how they interact everything is

3184.8 --> 3189.79
different

3185.78 --> 3195.239
it's everything I

3189.79 --> 3195.239
[Music]

3197.94 --> 3201.359
don't uh anyway

3199.5 --> 3203.099
I'm gonna harp too much on it it's just

3201.359 --> 3206.2999999999997
weirding me out some of these

3203.099 --> 3206.3
conclusions in the chat

3215.819 --> 3220.14
turns out [ __ ] every time

3218.579 --> 3223.04
okay

3220.14 --> 3223.04
yeah sure

3228.3 --> 3232.619
I mean

3230.28 --> 3235.7400000000002
what are you gonna do

3232.619 --> 3238.559
you know Alex Stein is like politically

3235.74 --> 3242.04
involved oh and Benjamin is not oh oh

3238.559 --> 3243.7200000000003
look yet another massive difference oh

3242.04 --> 3247.319
there you go yeah

3243.72 --> 3250.859
but Alex Stein is politically involved

3247.319 --> 3252.72
and so he is rooting for somebody that

3250.859 --> 3255.0589999999997
he thinks

3252.72 --> 3255.9599999999996
is the answer and he's on the Trump

3255.059 --> 3258.059
train

3255.96 --> 3259.7400000000002
even though the massive amount of issue

3258.059 --> 3263.88
that he definitely does give recognition

3259.74 --> 3266.0989999999997
he's not lying for him or anything okay

3263.88 --> 3268.319
as far as I've noticed he's never really

3266.099 --> 3270.9
done he's always been honest

3268.319 --> 3273.7799999999997
so

3270.9 --> 3276.78
but I mean he is getting involved in

3273.78 --> 3280.079
politics like that so yeah

3276.78 --> 3282.1800000000003
oh no he's signing with that idiot

3280.079 --> 3284.099
or whatever or however you want to see

3282.18 --> 3284.85
Trump I don't know I'm kind of neutral

3284.099 --> 3287.4
at this point

3284.85 --> 3290.819
[Music]

3287.4 --> 3292.14
but he's made some terrible Maneuvers in

3290.819 --> 3295.88
the past

3292.14 --> 3295.8799999999997
and everybody's well familiar with

3299.52 --> 3304.46
like project warp speed and all that but

3302.16 --> 3304.46
anyway

3307.079 --> 3313.2000000000003
yeah so maybe

3310.14 --> 3316.859
Alex Stein just likes to theorize a bit

3313.2 --> 3319.859
about what's gonna happen with Trump and

3316.859 --> 3322.5
like he wants to rekindle like that

3319.859 --> 3326.2799999999997
magic from the early years

3322.5 --> 3329.7
right I mean can you blame him

3326.28 --> 3332.8190000000004
no not really he's just really into that

3329.7 --> 3335.9399999999996
but yeah is he gonna be wrong about it a

3332.819 --> 3337.68
lot yeah because most people that have

3335.94 --> 3339.9
done that sort of thing and predictions

3337.68 --> 3343.0789999999997
they have been very wrong

3339.9 --> 3345.119
in many ways like half wrong half right

3343.079 --> 3348.1800000000003
well that makes it wrong that makes most

3345.119 --> 3350.1600000000003
things wrong in your prediction means

3348.18 --> 3352.5
that there's basically unpredictable you

3350.16 --> 3354.42
could just like make minor predictions

3352.5 --> 3355.92
about

3354.42 --> 3358.52
how he's going to do it or whatever

3355.92 --> 3358.52
right

3363.24 --> 3368.7799999999997
but not the overall staring direction of

3366.059 --> 3368.78
what Trump does

3368.819 --> 3373.98
and yeah there's a lot of people that do

3371.28 --> 3376.8
that they're like really putting all

3373.98 --> 3378.599
their hopes on Trump and all that

3376.8 --> 3380.6400000000003
and I think Alex Stein is just like that

3378.599 --> 3383.88
I mean

3380.64 --> 3386.48
oh that makes him a shill or a paid

3383.88 --> 3389.1600000000003
operative

3386.48 --> 3390.839
or he's just a guy that really believes

3389.16 --> 3392.819
in that and he's just thinks that that's

3390.839 --> 3394.92
the answer

3392.819 --> 3397.74
and you might not be

3394.92 --> 3400.94
super bright

3397.74 --> 3400.9399999999996
in that way

3402.48 --> 3408.18
I think that oh Benjamin brought it even

3404.46 --> 3410.579
up like in the stream from two days ago

3408.18 --> 3413.3999999999996
he said at some point like I'm a bimbo

3410.579 --> 3415.02
because I'm like oh yeah a new guy oh

3413.4 --> 3417.3
yeah everything crushes it's all good

3415.02 --> 3419.4
and then they turn out to be Gammas and

3417.3 --> 3421.5
that's happened many times there

3419.4 --> 3426.119
and he's like a bimbo is what he said

3421.5 --> 3428.76
well guess what Alex Dean is really a

3426.119 --> 3431.339
bimbo and he said it like he's really a

3428.76 --> 3433.559
freaking bimbo he's just like I love you

3431.339 --> 3436.339
man I just met you I love you I trust

3433.559 --> 3436.3390000000004
you with everything

3436.44 --> 3439.92
and he's even talked about that on his

3438.839 --> 3441.0589999999997
dreams

3439.92 --> 3443.4
right

3441.059 --> 3447.0
so yeah I mean

3443.4 --> 3449.4
it's just like he has that tendency Owen

3447.0 --> 3453.859
Benjamin has it much more under control

3449.4 --> 3453.859
oh oh look yet another difference

3456.78 --> 3459.8990000000003
[Music]

3463.07 --> 3466.889
[Music]

3469.339 --> 3476.7799999999997
Jewish conspiracy oh no

3472.98 --> 3476.78
Jewish conspiracy

3479.0 --> 3486.079
but it's harshit no it's called

3482.52 --> 3488.7599999999998
having a point and not just

3486.079 --> 3490.5
and then getting kicked off forever and

3488.76 --> 3491.94
then getting a reputation not being led

3490.5 --> 3493.68
on anything anymore yeah that's what

3491.94 --> 3494.94
that's called classical homeopath it's

3493.68 --> 3499.9199999999996
called

3494.94 --> 3499.92
having a persistent strategy

3501.24 --> 3506.839
yeah he's just like oh YouTube just said

3504.359 --> 3509.7
that we can't talk about this subject

3506.839 --> 3511.0789999999997
I'm gonna protest by talking about this

3509.7 --> 3512.9399999999996
subject some more yeah guess what's

3511.079 --> 3515.52
gonna happen you're gonna get kicked the

3512.94 --> 3519.48
[ __ ] off it's happened many times does

3515.52 --> 3521.16
that make you true I'm true no it makes

3519.48 --> 3523.38
you a [ __ ] idiot because you got

3521.16 --> 3527.7
kicked off

3523.38 --> 3531.299
you should have just not done that and

3527.7 --> 3533.22
done it somewhere else like oh yeah you

3531.299 --> 3534.299
know what I'll just have a bit shoot

3533.22 --> 3537.5989999999997
Channel

3534.299 --> 3539.22
where I'm gonna do other videos about

3537.599 --> 3540.78
these subjects that YouTube doesn't

3539.22 --> 3543.839
allow me to talk about yeah yeah and

3540.78 --> 3546.599
those people will still be around

3543.839 --> 3548.52
unless they get really really popular

3546.599 --> 3551.1600000000003
and get a lot of momentum and attention

3548.52 --> 3552.78
and then they might get necked anyway

3551.16 --> 3555.0789999999997
because they're actually becoming a

3552.78 --> 3555.079
threat

3566.099 --> 3569.54
Canadian truther

3572.119 --> 3577.339
the nice teeth you mean like that

3582.839 --> 3587.94
I think I know who you mean right it's

3584.819 --> 3590.16
like a pretty well-built guy

3587.94 --> 3592.319
and he always has like this weird smile

3590.16 --> 3595.02
on his face it's just the waist his

3592.319 --> 3597.7799999999997
teeth are and all that that guy

3595.02 --> 3600.38
like he's a pretty cool guy very

3597.78 --> 3600.38
sympathetic

3601.079 --> 3605.579
I don't remember his name that is that

3603.54 --> 3607.859
the one

3605.579 --> 3610.559
you're talking to

3607.859 --> 3612.96
yep yeah right yeah yeah yeah I know

3610.559 --> 3616.079
he's still out there I saw him like last

3612.96 --> 3619.859
week somewhere on the Alex Jones Show

3616.079 --> 3622.98
or was it yeah one of the infowar shows

3619.859 --> 3625.02
so he's still doing things

3622.98 --> 3627.359
last time yeah you still looked pretty

3625.02 --> 3630.48
cool although he didn't have as much

3627.359 --> 3635.0589999999997
smile energy that time

3630.48 --> 3635.059
he's always like really smiling a lot

3636.48 --> 3642.119
or he used to be very enthusiastic

3639.72 --> 3643.799
but uh yeah he's still around I don't

3642.119 --> 3645.799
know what he's up to really he's still

3643.799 --> 3648.54
just working on

3645.799 --> 3650.839
situation in Canada and with Trudeau and

3648.54 --> 3650.839
all that

3655.619 --> 3660.48
you think of David Wise what

3663.18 --> 3665.24
what

3669.48 --> 3675.72
nah

3672.48 --> 3677.28
I mean yeah they may have like roughly

3675.72 --> 3680.52
the same

3677.28 --> 3683.6600000000003
skull shape I get it

3680.52 --> 3688.04
but I mean they're so freaking different

3683.66 --> 3688.04
like the skin type is different

3691.38 --> 3696.839
and

3694.38 --> 3698.6400000000003
just their personality is very different

3696.839 --> 3701.339
but I don't know

3698.64 --> 3703.14
yeah but I know what you mean like they

3701.339 --> 3706.7
do kind of seem to have like a bit of

3703.14 --> 3706.7
the same skull shape whatever

3706.98 --> 3710.9
but no I wouldn't say family

3713.01 --> 3716.219
[Music]

wow

3827.18 --> 3833.94
oh yeah sorry just looking into a bit of

3830.22 --> 3837.0
Dutch politics stuff or whatever

3833.94 --> 3840.799
conversations pretty much stop

3837.0 --> 3840.799
over here so I'm just looking around

3863.64 --> 3868.0789999999997
right did I already mention yesterday

3866.04 --> 3870.98
about that

3868.079 --> 3873.96
there's like this political party debate

3870.98 --> 3875.88
before the elections

3873.96 --> 3877.14
which should be pretty soon by the way

3875.88 --> 3880.46
it's like

3877.14 --> 3880.46
March 11 is it

3885.0 --> 3890.76
like that that's when avoiding is for

3888.059 --> 3892.559
provincial States

3890.76 --> 3894.78
but like these parties have been

3892.559 --> 3897.299
excluded

3894.78 --> 3900.2400000000002
including form for democracy of course

3897.299 --> 3902.16
they always get targeted and

3900.24 --> 3903.66
party

3902.16 --> 3906.66
for

3903.66 --> 3906.66
foreign

3908.099 --> 3915.799
freedom and and people I don't know it

3911.64 --> 3915.799
doesn't translate well but uh yeah

3915.839 --> 3920.819
and there's like this this commotion I

3918.78 --> 3922.559
mean there's so much freaking commotion

3920.819 --> 3924.599
now in the politics

3922.559 --> 3926.7000000000003
in the Dutch Department it's real it's

3924.599 --> 3929.1600000000003
it's kind of interesting

3926.7 --> 3932.48
I don't feel like this has happened

3929.16 --> 3935.94
before that there's been just such

3932.48 --> 3939.02
activity there

3935.94 --> 3939.02
in this period

3940.5 --> 3945.72
is Dutch politics Crooks like the rest

3942.78 --> 3948.5400000000004
it well it's not all of them

3945.72 --> 3950.9399999999996
but the the cartel parties in power

3948.54 --> 3953.18
which are multiple parties yeah they are

3950.94 --> 3953.18
like

3953.339 --> 3957.42
weird man

3955.5 --> 3959.339
they're like multiple parties but

3957.42 --> 3961.6800000000003
they're all conspiring they're basically

3959.339 --> 3963.599
like the Democrat Party but they're

3961.68 --> 3967.44
secretly like they're secretly spanking

3963.599 --> 3967.44
they're like different departments

3967.5 --> 3973.26
like they [ __ ] up their Department

3970.339 --> 3976.2
seriously it's like oh yeah we're we're

3973.26 --> 3978.059
pro for nature and so we're gonna [ __ ]

3976.2 --> 3981.5589999999997
it up with climate change for usage

3978.059 --> 3985.26
right like oh where no we're for labor

3981.559 --> 3987.48
and so we're going to make the poor poor

3985.26 --> 3990.78
screw everything up

3987.48 --> 3992.819
right that sort of [ __ ] so there's like

3990.78 --> 3995.52
these different political parties that

3992.819 --> 3997.68
have their own Focus right what they're

3995.52 --> 4000.68
addressing what they're focusing on

3997.68 --> 4002.48
and they are corrupted a lot of them are

4000.68 --> 4004.64
just corrupted and they're like together

4002.48 --> 4006.5
they form one party with multiple

4004.64 --> 4008.9
departments

4006.5 --> 4012.02
and they're really screwing everything

4008.9 --> 4015.02
up on purpose they're like Marxist

4012.02 --> 4015.02
infiltrators

4015.079 --> 4019.94
they're literally there it's like very

4017.78 --> 4023.0
well known at this point like they are

4019.94 --> 4024.859
actively trying to destroy this country

4023.0 --> 4027.619
and at this point

4024.859 --> 4030.2599999999998
the treason is so egregious that I'm

4027.619 --> 4033.5
like they definitely deserve the death

4030.26 --> 4034.88
penalty for just for just the spirit of

4033.5 --> 4038.0
this

4034.88 --> 4040.7000000000003
right it's not even about the damage

4038.0 --> 4043.18
that it's just that they are so

4040.7 --> 4047.48
blatantly

4043.18 --> 4050.96
anti the nation they are so infiltrating

4047.48 --> 4054.38
and sabotaging their saboteurs

4050.96 --> 4057.44
there's foreign agents

4054.38 --> 4060.079
there to sabotage us

4057.44 --> 4062.96
posing as our helpers

4060.079 --> 4065.0
and that's treason it's like the worst

4062.96 --> 4067.579
of the worst type of treason

4065.0 --> 4070.599
and yeah and it might even involve the

4067.579 --> 4073.76
entire Noble house as well which is

4070.599 --> 4076.6400000000003
massive problem

4073.76 --> 4078.6800000000003
like that they did that is like that's

4076.64 --> 4079.94
gonna mean like it's gonna get really

4078.68 --> 4083.359
bad

4079.94 --> 4086.0
like it's a we have to survive this and

4083.359 --> 4089.14
fight against this and overcome them or

4086.0 --> 4089.14
or it's all gone

4090.44 --> 4094.819
or this will lead to like actual erasing

4093.559 --> 4098.0
of people

4094.819 --> 4100.2789999999995
where they will just destroy everything

4098.0 --> 4104.0
and then completely re-engineer this

4100.279 --> 4106.160000000001
into some kind of city-state hell

4104.0 --> 4108.08
where it's going to be just like Los

4106.16 --> 4110.66
Angeles or something

4108.08 --> 4113.7789999999995
like the worst of the corrupted [ __ ]

4110.66 --> 4115.04
getting all the like with violence and

4113.779 --> 4117.319
everything

4115.04 --> 4120.56
gangs everywhere

4117.319 --> 4122.719
and riddled with drugs everything that

4120.56 --> 4125.96
goes wrong in America that gets really

4122.719 --> 4128.06
wrong that will happen here if these

4125.96 --> 4131.9
people stay in control long enough they

4128.06 --> 4134.06
will do all that the worst applications

4131.9 --> 4136.339
that they could figure out they will

4134.06 --> 4140.080000000001
subject us to that

4136.339 --> 4140.08
if we let them continue

4142.46 --> 4147.679
they're really tedious and devilish

4145.219 --> 4150.679
or yeah it is definitely she's not

4147.679 --> 4152.839
demonic because they're just way too

4150.679 --> 4155.299
prepared and plan it like they are

4152.839 --> 4157.94
planning it but they are also as

4155.299 --> 4159.799
individuals quite insane

4157.94 --> 4162.44
they're like obsessed people that

4159.799 --> 4166.66
literally they're just

4162.44 --> 4166.66
everything is just about doing this

4167.12 --> 4171.38
they are possessed by demons it's very

4169.58 --> 4174.14
much like that they have this demon

4171.38 --> 4177.4400000000005
that's using their organizing capacity

4174.14 --> 4179.9800000000005
to literally wreck this country and get

4177.44 --> 4179.98
away with it

4183.08 --> 4186.46
hey LSG good to see you

4187.16 --> 4194.8589999999995
right and yeah and that's also going on

4189.62 --> 4194.8589999999995
in the United States but it in here it's

4195.5 --> 4200.3
different because we're Dutch and there

4198.38 --> 4203.0
is like a whole culture here of actually

4200.3 --> 4206.42
engaging much more

4203.0 --> 4209.96
with more purpose and more teaching

4206.42 --> 4212.719
there's more smarts in politics and well

4209.96 --> 4215.54
guess what all the woke politician

4212.719 --> 4218.0
[ __ ] the New World Order

4215.54 --> 4220.04
they're all making everything still more

4218.0 --> 4221.54
stupid and that has also been

4220.04 --> 4223.1
influencing a whole bunch of people that

4221.54 --> 4225.8
have been riding with them that are now

4223.1 --> 4228.26
effectively complete oblivious retards

4225.8 --> 4230.360000000001
that are very very easily going to get

4228.26 --> 4232.04
themselves killed

4230.36 --> 4233.839999999999
if that was

4232.04 --> 4237.5
on the list

4233.84 --> 4240.6990000000005
for them to do given to them rolled out

4237.5 --> 4240.699
by the propaganda

4240.98 --> 4246.799999999999
a lot of them have been getting killed

4243.699 --> 4249.08
because of the whole you know what

4246.8 --> 4251.42
medical experimentation

4249.08 --> 4252.92
and the numbers have been suppressed and

4251.42 --> 4255.679
there's a lot of news about that coming

4252.92 --> 4257.36
out it's like yeah it's very egregious a

4255.679 --> 4260.12
lot of people that have trusted these

4257.36 --> 4261.679
cartel parties which are by the way like

4260.12 --> 4262.88
a majority

4261.679 --> 4265.58
like

4262.88 --> 4267.26
they've corrupted the majority of these

4265.58 --> 4269.42
parties

4267.26 --> 4271.1
though the majority of the government is

4269.42 --> 4272.2390000000005
effectively corrupted

4271.1 --> 4275.84
but

4272.239 --> 4277.759999999999
the corruption is also causing a lot of

4275.84 --> 4280.34
good people

4277.76 --> 4281.96
that were part of these parties

4280.34 --> 4283.9400000000005
to leave

4281.96 --> 4286.179
they're like the parties themselves are

4283.94 --> 4289.04
like destabilizing and losing members

4286.179 --> 4291.8
but I don't it's just a cover because

4289.04 --> 4293.659
it's just a certain people that are in

4291.8 --> 4295.88
control there and they are doing these

4293.659 --> 4300.0199999999995
Maneuvers the parties are just there as

4295.88 --> 4303.08
a cover to make it seem democratic

4300.02 --> 4304.64
because there's people that protest in

4303.08 --> 4307.159
their party and they just don't give a

4304.64 --> 4308.900000000001
[ __ ] they don't give a [ __ ] if if the

4307.159 --> 4311.78
opposition protests they don't give a

4308.9 --> 4314.36
[ __ ] if the people protest and they

4311.78 --> 4317.3
don't give a [ __ ] if people in their own

4314.36 --> 4320.679
party protest okay

4317.3 --> 4323.06
it's a ruse it's a cover

4320.679 --> 4326.2390000000005
the whole party

4323.06 --> 4329.3
system for them is just the cover the

4326.239 --> 4332.12
blanket and the blanket of legitimacy

4329.3 --> 4335.2390000000005
because they are Marxist infiltrators

4332.12 --> 4337.699
and they are there being actively driven

4335.239 --> 4341.239
by dark Forces

4337.699 --> 4343.58
with an obsessive goal to wreck the

4341.239 --> 4345.5599999999995
country everything that's good about it

4343.58 --> 4347.96
it's production capability its

4345.56 --> 4351.14
intellectual capability

4347.96 --> 4354.32
it's stability

4351.14 --> 4357.320000000001
it's self-sufficiency

4354.32 --> 4360.0199999999995
it's food supply everything everything

4357.32 --> 4362.719
they want to wreck everything

4360.02 --> 4365.179
and they're doing their best to do it

4362.719 --> 4368.36
obsessively even though their own people

4365.179 --> 4371.179
in their own party disagree

4368.36 --> 4373.36
when they do I mean a lot of them are

4371.179 --> 4376.52
basically riding on financially

4373.36 --> 4378.5
investments in doing all that

4376.52 --> 4380.06
but even as you're like investing like

4378.5 --> 4382.159
oh I want to make money and they're like

4380.06 --> 4385.46
oh yeah the money that I'm making is

4382.159 --> 4387.679
actually destroying this

4385.46 --> 4389.659
hmm

4387.679 --> 4391.28
yeah some people might go along with

4389.659 --> 4393.199
that but if you're just getting more and

4391.28 --> 4395.12
more and more then eventually some

4393.199 --> 4397.639999999999
people are going to be like yeah I I

4395.12 --> 4400.099999999999
can't do this anymore

4397.64 --> 4401.780000000001
I'm I'm depressed now I'm [ __ ]

4400.1 --> 4403.46
miserable because

4401.78 --> 4405.199
yeah I got money but everything is

4403.46 --> 4406.52
getting torn down everything that I

4405.199 --> 4409.4
loved is just

4406.52 --> 4412.400000000001
people are miserable now

4409.4 --> 4414.739
that I that I used to be happy with

4412.4 --> 4417.44
so they that's happening in their

4414.739 --> 4420.08
parties they're losing members they're

4417.44 --> 4422.0599999999995
getting friction within it but they're

4420.08 --> 4423.92
still at the top they're all covered in

4422.06 --> 4427.64
Legally and they're just doing their

4423.92 --> 4428.9
thing because the entire party is just a

4427.64 --> 4431.179
cover

4428.9 --> 4432.799999999999
it's just a cover to make it seem

4431.179 --> 4434.96
Democratic and to make all these people

4432.8 --> 4437.360000000001
in the party feel like they're part of

4434.96 --> 4439.219
the party and they decide no they don't

4437.36 --> 4441.679
it's the people at the top of those

4439.219 --> 4443.719
parties that decide and nobody can do

4441.679 --> 4446.4800000000005
anything about it because they're not

4443.719 --> 4450.219
part of that club

4446.48 --> 4450.218999999999
of which they comprise

4452.54 --> 4457.94
they wouldn't want to be

4455.12 --> 4459.98
because they're very [ __ ] up and evil

4457.94 --> 4462.199
really

4459.98 --> 4465.639999999999
and Psychopathic they don't care about

4462.199 --> 4465.639999999999
feelings at all

4468.34 --> 4473.360000000001
so yeah that's roughly the situation

4470.84 --> 4475.1
here but people are catching on and I

4473.36 --> 4477.94
mean a lot of conspiracy thinking is

4475.1 --> 4477.9400000000005
kind of commonplace

4481.699 --> 4488.48
it is really understood like yeah yeah

4485.3 --> 4491.6
we're being infiltrated these people are

4488.48 --> 4494.659
infiltrators like people in general kind

4491.6 --> 4496.64
of know now unless they're like super on

4494.659 --> 4500.239
medication and they only watch like

4496.64 --> 4502.58
[ __ ] TV all day and they're just

4500.239 --> 4505.28
idiots

4502.58 --> 4506.719
but the regular people that go around

4505.28 --> 4509.3
like yeah

4506.719 --> 4511.58
they know they're like

4509.3 --> 4514.04
not even eager to talk but they know

4511.58 --> 4517.04
it's like it's known now people are

4514.04 --> 4519.5
actually no like even the people

4517.04 --> 4521.48
that get caught up in things

4519.5 --> 4524.36
and and if you bring it up some people

4521.48 --> 4526.459999999999
might get really triggered why because

4524.36 --> 4528.139999999999
they know it's true and it makes them

4526.46 --> 4529.699
really miserable and they don't want to

4528.14 --> 4532.6990000000005
hear about it

4529.699 --> 4534.44
so that can also happen over here if

4532.699 --> 4536.839999999999
you're really gonna get outspoken and

4534.44 --> 4541.159
loud about these types of things

4536.84 --> 4543.14
but people know so

4541.159 --> 4545.179
and that's kind of a difference with the

4543.14 --> 4547.46
United States that's also because the

4545.179 --> 4549.679
United States is just so freaking huge

4547.46 --> 4551.42
is that people just don't feel it's that

4549.679 --> 4554.36
close to them

4551.42 --> 4556.58
so they don't really realize like how

4554.36 --> 4558.08
bad it is still plenty of people in the

4556.58 --> 4560.98
United States that think well no yeah

4558.08 --> 4560.98
everything's just fine

4562.159 --> 4567.44
in the Netherlands no [ __ ] body

4565.52 --> 4571.52
things over everything's just fine

4567.44 --> 4572.839999999999
nobody everybody knows it's [ __ ] this

4571.52 --> 4575.719
and some people are like yeah it's

4572.84 --> 4578.42
[ __ ] but I'm making money here right

4575.719 --> 4580.76
but everybody knows it's [ __ ] that's

4578.42 --> 4583.54
the difference between the Netherlands

4580.76 --> 4583.54
and the United States

4584.179 --> 4586.36
foreign

4589.159 --> 4594.679
so I hope you like that speech

4592.28 --> 4596.86
in response to what I was saying hello

4594.679 --> 4602.679
Godzilla good to see you

4596.86 --> 4602.679
sheesh Mech duck what okay

4603.62 --> 4606.28
all right hello

4613.1 --> 4615.820000000001
what

4618.02 --> 4622.42
have to take down it what the [ __ ] why

4627.92 --> 4633.219
what the hell

4630.38 --> 4637.64
you have to take down your Greenhouse

4633.219 --> 4641.78
or how about make me

4637.64 --> 4644.06
wow you guys don't have [ __ ] guns

4641.78 --> 4646.04
I mean I at some point I'm a good idea

4644.06 --> 4647.38
like it yeah dude just

4646.04 --> 4650.9
I mean

4647.38 --> 4653.56
sure try your SWAT teams or whatever but

4650.9 --> 4653.5599999999995
[ __ ] you

4655.28 --> 4661.599999999999
how about I'm not gonna do any of that

4657.38 --> 4661.6
because none of your [ __ ] business

4664.64 --> 4667.64
foreign

4675.82 --> 4679.719
that's a different story but

4684.679 --> 4690.26
uh what's the difference between it

4687.98 --> 4693.0199999999995
being conspiracy theory and Truth six

4690.26 --> 4695.320000000001
months yeah it's a good one I've heard

4693.02 --> 4695.320000000001
it before

4699.32 --> 4707.86
although that's ramping up though I mean

4702.44 --> 4707.86
it's gonna be like one week eventually

4709.1 --> 4713.96
things are going to be

4710.92 --> 4715.28
looked through figure it out so quickly

4713.96 --> 4718.719
at some point

4715.28 --> 4718.719
that it's gonna be like

4718.82 --> 4723.0199999999995
crazy

4720.38 --> 4724.159000000001
like oh something happened oh no and

4723.02 --> 4727.280000000001
then it's like

4724.159 --> 4729.139999999999
oh wait okay everybody's like okay well

4727.28 --> 4730.88
here we have this well this is what

4729.14 --> 4733.219
could happen this is what it could have

4730.88 --> 4734.900000000001
been uh here's that and then and then

4733.219 --> 4736.76
here's the experts and then it's like

4734.9 --> 4738.5
okay two days later like yeah we know

4736.76 --> 4740.8
it's fake we definitely know here's the

4738.5 --> 4740.8
evidence

4740.86 --> 4746.12
so it's like yeah no we don't need

4743.96 --> 4748.4
because we all got reputable sources

4746.12 --> 4750.44
confirming this and

4748.4 --> 4752.36
yeah

4750.44 --> 4755.36
it's what do you mean conspiracy

4752.36 --> 4757.58
theories we have proof

4755.36 --> 4760.46
so at some point it's going to be so

4757.58 --> 4762.26
quickly figured out all these roses and

4760.46 --> 4765.38
[ __ ]

4762.26 --> 4767.659000000001
and when that happens then also like

4765.38 --> 4769.28
it's just gonna seem much more like a

4767.659 --> 4771.92
Puppet Theater because they're gonna

4769.28 --> 4773.78
still continue rolling it out like based

4771.92 --> 4776.84
on a more long-term schedule when things

4773.78 --> 4779.179
are solved so quickly it's just gonna

4776.84 --> 4781.400000000001
seem like a weird Puppet Theater that's

4779.179 --> 4782.84
like out of date it just keeps doing

4781.4 --> 4784.58
that

4782.84 --> 4786.5
this is going to happen eventually I

4784.58 --> 4787.88
predict that

4786.5 --> 4789.98
because things are going to be figured

4787.88 --> 4792.8
out so quickly that they just

4789.98 --> 4794.659
there's they the only thing they can do

4792.8 --> 4796.58
is just pretend

4794.659 --> 4799.639999999999
to the people that are not catching on

4796.58 --> 4801.44
like it still works that way

4799.64 --> 4804.02
but there will be very few of those

4801.44 --> 4806.599999999999
people left because those people would

4804.02 --> 4809.3
have mostly died because those people

4806.6 --> 4811.52
are subjected to execution policies

4809.3 --> 4813.679
secret covert

4811.52 --> 4816.620000000001
they get targeted

4813.679 --> 4818.84
with medical experimentation and such so

4816.62 --> 4821.96
over time more and more of those people

4818.84 --> 4824.4800000000005
for which the illusion will work will

4821.96 --> 4826.28
die off and then eventually there will

4824.48 --> 4828.259999999999
be nobody left

4826.28 --> 4831.08
and it will just be like a dead ghost

4828.26 --> 4835.3
acting out this slow acting everybody

4831.08 --> 4835.3
that's still alive is just not buying it

4835.4 --> 4840.5599999999995
so what will they do from that point

4838.159 --> 4844.099999999999
flee

4840.56 --> 4846.92
like suddenly shut off the ACT

4844.1 --> 4848.360000000001
and just disappear or something

4846.92 --> 4851.0
or

4848.36 --> 4853.4
suddenly break out in a Nazi Empire

4851.0 --> 4855.44
fashion and just like yeah we are now

4853.4 --> 4857.239
just going to execute anybody who

4855.44 --> 4860.54
opposes us

4857.239 --> 4862.218999999999
it's like we attain the right to just

4860.54 --> 4864.38
execute people

4862.219 --> 4867.02
like what were you gonna stop

4864.38 --> 4868.82
who's gonna stop it like that could be

4867.02 --> 4872.0
something that they're gonna go super

4868.82 --> 4873.62
tyrannical much more overtly but I mean

4872.0 --> 4876.88
that would also probably fail pretty

4873.62 --> 4876.88
quickly there is opposition

4878.179 --> 4883.82
out there

4879.86 --> 4885.88
it's not a uniform New World Order

4883.82 --> 4889.34
so

4885.88 --> 4893.14
the likelihood of this act that's

4889.34 --> 4893.14
rolling out like the whole

4893.32 --> 4899.9
Rothschild Rockefeller

4896.36 --> 4903.259999999999
bushes Biden

4899.9 --> 4905.719
thing and all their connections around

4903.26 --> 4908.3
the world and their operatives

4905.719 --> 4910.699
like that thing is gonna collapse

4908.3 --> 4914.8
very like very soon

4910.699 --> 4914.799999999999
within like a few years

4916.58 --> 4921.5
and wouldn't necessarily be the complete

4918.92 --> 4923.3
end of it because after that there's the

4921.5 --> 4925.76
other Generations that have probably

4923.3 --> 4927.860000000001
already adapted to that happening

4925.76 --> 4929.900000000001
because it was going to be inevitable

4927.86 --> 4932.42
everybody's seeing it coming and they

4929.9 --> 4933.92
will have to like they will reinvest all

4932.42 --> 4936.1990000000005
their resources that they stole

4933.92 --> 4938.12
effectively right because that's what's

4936.199 --> 4941.199
happening right now with Ukraine it's

4938.12 --> 4944.719
all stealing money from the public

4941.199 --> 4947.0
disappearing it into that black hole and

4944.719 --> 4950.719
that stuff is all getting reinvested

4947.0 --> 4952.28
around to reseed the new generations for

4950.719 --> 4955.46
the New World Order and try again

4952.28 --> 4957.62
because that's all they have left doing

4955.46 --> 4959.36
because they are going to lose the the

4957.62 --> 4962.0599999999995
thing in control right now those people

4959.36 --> 4964.9
it's going to collapse and that's never

4962.06 --> 4964.900000000001
gonna come back

4965.9 --> 4971.179
they are not gonna come back that that

4968.84 --> 4973.42
act those actors that generation that's

4971.179 --> 4973.42
over

4973.52 --> 4981.8
but there is attempts of creating new

4978.739 --> 4984.0199999999995
World Order groups

4981.8 --> 4987.76
things plans out there for the future

4984.02 --> 4990.9400000000005
and like taking more Monopoly over

4987.76 --> 4993.5
technological development

4990.94 --> 4996.199
keeping the medical industry alive

4993.5 --> 4999.32
corrupting it making it a Eugenics mind

4996.199 --> 5002.259999999999
control system more and more right

4999.32 --> 5004.9
all these systems

5002.26 --> 5008.5
they will keep developing that even

5004.9 --> 5012.28
though there's no uniform control

5008.5 --> 5013.9
they will just try to like all logs

5012.28 --> 5015.82
these Mario corporations will just still

5013.9 --> 5017.799999999999
be out there legally

5015.82 --> 5019.96
allowed to operate

5017.8 --> 5022.360000000001
but they will just get more and more

5019.96 --> 5025.179
evil and invasive and

5022.36 --> 5026.679
like try to just infiltrate things and

5025.179 --> 5030.28
ruin it and they would just keep

5026.679 --> 5034.14
destroying other companies

5030.28 --> 5034.139999999999
so yeah nothing really new

5035.86 --> 5040.679
right I mean devil never really goes

5038.5 --> 5040.679
away

5042.28 --> 5046.0199999999995
they just reinvents himself

5048.1 --> 5051.6990000000005
but this current generation doing this

5050.44 --> 5054.58
whole thing now

5051.699 --> 5056.5
all that power

5054.58 --> 5059.219
it's already been fading for a while and

5056.5 --> 5062.38
it's gonna end there's no way that can

5059.219 --> 5063.46
re-emerge from this diet then it's going

5062.38 --> 5065.38
through

5063.46 --> 5067.2390000000005
there's no possibility

5065.38 --> 5069.6990000000005
it's going to end for a while

5067.239 --> 5073.0
at the same time all that stolen money

5069.699 --> 5075.699
out there is going to be hidden Like

5073.0 --> 5078.04
Pirates burying their treasure

5075.699 --> 5082.0199999999995
and then whatever survives is gonna dig

5078.04 --> 5082.0199999999995
up the treasure again and start over

5082.42 --> 5086.46
that's what's happening that's my

5084.04 --> 5086.46
prediction

5086.92 --> 5090.659
hey steam traveler good to see you man

5108.76 --> 5111.3
foreign

5117.76 --> 5122.9800000000005
it's [ __ ] just I I don't know what

5120.76 --> 5127.179
what the situation is you seem to be

5122.98 --> 5129.699
outraging over it but uh yeah just don't

5127.179 --> 5133.42
let them close it

5129.699 --> 5135.82
just find it be a lawyer and then find

5133.42 --> 5138.159
out how much of a bureaucratic piece of

5135.82 --> 5140.62
[ __ ]

5138.159 --> 5142.659
it is

5140.62 --> 5145.48
and then stop it

5142.659 --> 5146.98
or oh we can't afford it and oh no

5145.48 --> 5149.08
everything's going to [ __ ] and then it's

5146.98 --> 5152.759999999999
going to go to [ __ ]

5149.08 --> 5152.76
so you pick

5159.28 --> 5161.82
right

5164.62 --> 5168.88
anyway it's gonna be a live show over at

5166.78 --> 5172.08
fpd

5168.88 --> 5172.08
it's in throughout the link

5186.52 --> 5189.52
foreign

5215.139 --> 5221.56
yeah right over knuckle oh maybe you

5219.04 --> 5224.58
guys could like contact each other and

5221.56 --> 5224.580000000001
figure it out

5225.04 --> 5230.8
I take it you're in yeah you were in

5227.199 --> 5230.799999999999
England right Cheech

5241.78 --> 5244.78
foreign

5255.04 --> 5257.76
all right

5258.82 --> 5262.44
right well Cheech

5262.719 --> 5267.1
what you could do

5265.12 --> 5268.9
if it's gonna get really if they're

5267.1 --> 5271.96
gonna really push it and like send

5268.9 --> 5274.9
officers over supposedly

5271.96 --> 5277.719
make a media item out of it just record

5274.9 --> 5279.58
it report it you'll find somebody

5277.719 --> 5283.38
that'll

5279.58 --> 5283.38
pick up on it for sure

5285.52 --> 5291.219
but you might want to find a good lawyer

5288.76 --> 5292.780000000001
but hey you might find a good lawyer buy

5291.219 --> 5295.2390000000005
basically

5292.78 --> 5296.259999999999
making an item about it and putting it

5295.239 --> 5300.239
online

5296.26 --> 5300.2390000000005
so that people know what's going on

5303.1 --> 5306.780000000001
just telling you your options

5313.6 --> 5319.2390000000005
good idea yeah excellent yeah I mean it

5316.3 --> 5321.42
that is that it that does work I've seen

5319.239 --> 5321.419999999999
it

5329.44 --> 5333.58
right it

5331.0 --> 5336.36
anyway good luck

5333.58 --> 5339.28
it's ridiculous I mean

5336.36 --> 5341.32
like what do you mean you have to stop

5339.28 --> 5343.54
the greenhouse in your own garden like

5341.32 --> 5344.82
who the [ __ ] are you man shut the [ __ ]

5343.54 --> 5348.9
up

5344.82 --> 5348.9
it's none of your goddamn business

5351.58 --> 5356.199
right if you don't have any illegal

5353.679 --> 5358.5
plants then it's none of their damn

5356.199 --> 5358.5
business

5359.139 --> 5361.92
right anyway

5382.659 --> 5385.839999999999
whoa

5384.46 --> 5390.52
oh

5385.84 --> 5390.52
what the hell okay

5396.1 --> 5400.139
oh [ __ ] where did that come from

5401.08 --> 5403.62
huh

5405.699 --> 5410.5199999999995
yeah I'm just checking the GTI thingy

5419.02 --> 5423.109
interesting

5420.08 --> 5423.109
[Music]

5429.659 --> 5434.32
there's something in the air there's

5431.86 --> 5437.199
some energy happening

5434.32 --> 5440.38
I like it keep it up

5437.199 --> 5443.138999999999
I will try to reinforce that energy

5440.38 --> 5445.92
to hold on for it as long as humanly

5443.139 --> 5445.92
possible

5445.96 --> 5450.36
because I could sure use more luck

5450.42 --> 5455.32
and money

5453.04 --> 5457.54
directly indirectly

5455.32 --> 5459.82
and yeah I could definitely use PayPal

5457.54 --> 5461.8
support so

5459.82 --> 5464.759999999999
guys

5461.8 --> 5464.76
please do so

5467.86 --> 5471.159
or

5469.0 --> 5473.699
maybe I need to talk about Flat Earth

5471.159 --> 5473.699
some more

5473.92 --> 5478.84
before I do that

5476.44 --> 5480.759999999999
before I can accomplish that maybe I'm

5478.84 --> 5481.900000000001
not just getting not so much support

5480.76 --> 5484.360000000001
because

5481.9 --> 5486.299999999999
I'm not yapping on about Flat Earth

5484.36 --> 5488.38
non-stop

5499.12 --> 5505.96
shows or two if yeah like where is what

5503.02 --> 5507.9400000000005

5505.96 --> 5510.699
title that you never talk about

5507.94 --> 5512.678999999999

5617.5 --> 5624.36
it's like yeah man I've been drowning

5620.02 --> 5624.360000000001
the damn Flat Earth for so long

5625.9 --> 5631.679
we gotta talk about other things than

5627.88 --> 5631.679
Flat Earth because it's like Flat Earth

5632.04 --> 5636.1
well the funny thing is I am a little

5634.6 --> 5638.26
bit like that

5636.1 --> 5641.219
but I'm definitely not sick of flatter

5638.26 --> 5641.219
it's just that

5641.92 --> 5645.58
I can't get myself to like talk about it

5644.38 --> 5649.2390000000005
all the time

5645.58 --> 5650.38
like well the guys offered fed really do

5649.239 --> 5652.718999999999
that

5650.38 --> 5655.6
I just can't find enough

5652.719 --> 5657.52
material to really do that I mean

5655.6 --> 5659.679
sometimes I like to get up close and

5657.52 --> 5662.139
like figure out like hey what the [ __ ]

5659.679 --> 5666.639
is the hell holographic Celestial light

5662.139 --> 5668.86
right what is that why or like how what

5666.639 --> 5671.02
is the realm can't find is there a

5668.86 --> 5672.94
looping thing is a flat top right is it

5671.02 --> 5675.84
just going through it

5672.94 --> 5675.839999999999
do that a bit

5676.06 --> 5681.88
but I mean yeah it's just all a bunch of

5679.6 --> 5685.4800000000005
like oh yeah rehashing speculation

5681.88 --> 5687.400000000001
because I don't have any capability of

5685.48 --> 5689.879999999999
actually confirming anything about it

5687.4 --> 5689.879999999999
physically

5690.52 --> 5696.040000000001
so it seems a bit pointless to just keep

5693.88 --> 5698.7390000000005
doing that every now and then it's like

5696.04 --> 5700.179
not making a point just doing that it's

5698.739 --> 5701.919999999999
just showing like oh yeah it could be

5700.179 --> 5705.58
this could be that

5701.92 --> 5707.56
with very serious considerations about

5705.58 --> 5708.699
the process

5707.56 --> 5711.9400000000005
but

5708.699 --> 5714.04
yeah I'm not physically testing it

5711.94 --> 5715.54
most of it although there was this new

5714.04 --> 5718.719
thing by the way

5715.54 --> 5721.48
the freaking thermosphere

5718.719 --> 5724.32
did I did bring that up right like two

5721.48 --> 5724.32
days ago or something

5725.739 --> 5733.718999999999
the QE insisted that the thermosphere

5731.139 --> 5735.1
is like things in the thermosphere get a

5733.719 --> 5737.8
thousand degrees

5735.1 --> 5740.8
based on what

5737.8 --> 5740.8
nothing

5741.28 --> 5748.12
oh wait some device that at ground level

5744.9 --> 5750.759999999999
sends Rays or

5748.12 --> 5754.199
radio weights or something and then can

5750.76 --> 5754.1990000000005
measure temperature with that

5754.42 --> 5758.34
and it

5756.34 --> 5760.84
it's data

5758.34 --> 5763.6
confirms that it's a thousand degrees

5760.84 --> 5766.92
Celsius up there and I'm like did

5763.6 --> 5766.92
anybody ever go there

5768.36 --> 5772.839999999999
interferometry right okay Adam making

5770.8 --> 5773.9800000000005
but did anybody actually go there and

5772.84 --> 5776.08
like hey

5773.98 --> 5778.659
let's have a physical object let's see

5776.08 --> 5780.699
how hot this object gets I don't think

5778.659 --> 5783.179
they ever done that I think it's all

5780.699 --> 5784.799999999999
just inferred

5783.179 --> 5788.08
inference

5784.8 --> 5790.54
inferometry right

5788.08 --> 5792.88
do we laughed at that hello by the way

5790.54 --> 5796.0
Adam making thanks for showed up

5792.88 --> 5797.86
but kiwi laughed in the Skype chat about

5796.0 --> 5800.44
that

5797.86 --> 5803.159
like oh what are you talking about it's

5800.44 --> 5803.159
solid proof

5803.98 --> 5808.839999999999
like uh no I think it's actually

5806.679 --> 5813.54
probably just some weird

5808.84 --> 5813.54
issue just like with p waves and S waves

5813.639 --> 5818.86
where it's just like yeah you can

5815.92 --> 5821.02
measure it up close oh that's relatively

5818.86 --> 5823.36
accurate oh how about deeper oh yeah

5821.02 --> 5826.96
well it gets a bit fuzzy wuzzy you have

5823.36 --> 5831.159
it's off so how about super deep so you

5826.96 --> 5833.139
can scan the chords like yeah yeah well

5831.159 --> 5834.9
every time we do yeah this thing's

5833.139 --> 5838.92
rolling out there but it's like

5834.9 --> 5838.92
absolutely wrong every time

5839.08 --> 5844.92
so why would you think that through some

5841.78 --> 5847.42
device that uses some kind of inference

5844.92 --> 5851.26
informatory why would you assume that

5847.42 --> 5853.84
you can just point at light

5851.26 --> 5855.46
or like at the sky

5853.84 --> 5857.92
and then

5855.46 --> 5859.42
measure the temperature there to be a

5857.92 --> 5861.52
thousand degrees it just seems

5859.42 --> 5864.28
absolutely [ __ ]

5861.52 --> 5866.26
it it really does seem [ __ ] that

5864.28 --> 5867.699
people just assume that it's like oh

5866.26 --> 5869.8
yeah it's a thousand degrees there it's

5867.699 --> 5872.699
like do you [ __ ] know how hot a

5869.8 --> 5872.6990000000005
thousand degrees is

5875.62 --> 5881.88
a thousand degrees melts Metals okay

5882.58 --> 5889.239
it's really insanely hot

5886.54 --> 5890.26
there's no [ __ ] way that there is a

5889.239 --> 5893.739
point

5890.26 --> 5896.62
above us where if you just hang around

5893.739 --> 5901.48
that you'll start melting because it's

5896.62 --> 5903.04
so [ __ ] hot there's no [ __ ] way no

5901.48 --> 5904.239
way

5903.04 --> 5906.639
yeah

5904.239 --> 5908.62
sure it might be a place where for some

5906.639 --> 5910.6
mysterious reason it's like oh yeah it's

5908.62 --> 5912.219
all very cold up there and then like oh

5910.6 --> 5913.84
wait it's a little less cold no that's

5912.219 --> 5915.46
weird oh it's getting cold again right

5913.84 --> 5918.04
yeah

5915.46 --> 5919.78
that's not a thousand degrees Celsius

5918.04 --> 5921.94
okay

5919.78 --> 5925.0199999999995
something going through that through a

5921.94 --> 5928.419999999999
thousand degrees Celsius what happens

5925.02 --> 5931.659000000001
falls down to the through the ground

5928.42 --> 5934.36
yeah because it the balloon popped and

5931.659 --> 5936.46
the thing that you use the satellite

5934.36 --> 5938.32
where it melted yeah that's what's gonna

5936.46 --> 5940.659
happen when you put it through a region

5938.32 --> 5943.48
that's a thousand degrees Celsius it's

5940.659 --> 5947.44
absolutely [ __ ] why do people

5943.48 --> 5949.299999999999
even Flat Earth is even QE still assume

5947.44 --> 5952.62
that that's real

5949.3 --> 5952.62
what the [ __ ] is that

5954.219 --> 5957.219
what's the melting point of gold and

5955.9 --> 5960.719
silver

5957.219 --> 5960.719
I don't remember by heart

5962.38 --> 5965.1
I thought it was

5965.81 --> 5968.879000000001
[Music]

5969.159 --> 5973.92
yeah silver is 961 degrees

5974.5 --> 5980.86
gold is a thousand sixty four degrees

5977.679 --> 5983.4400000000005
right very close to one another

5980.86 --> 5984.4
that's the pure version but yeah as I

5983.44 --> 5986.98
said

5984.4 --> 5989.32
a thousand degrees Celsius that's like

5986.98 --> 5993.0
it could melt gold how do you think

5989.32 --> 5993.0
circuitry is going to hold up

5993.88 --> 5997.92
okay it's ridiculous

6002.94 --> 6008.46
so what do you mean thermosphere

6005.659 --> 6012.12
thermosphere is a freaking nonsense it's

6008.46 --> 6014.76
just another freaking sphere another air

6012.12 --> 6018.659
layer in their imaginary globe world oh

6014.76 --> 6021.96
we got the ozone layer a layer of

6018.659 --> 6024.179
separated ozone that's heavier it's it's

6021.96 --> 6026.1
more dense gas

6024.179 --> 6027.4800000000005
then what's surrounding that in that

6026.1 --> 6029.6990000000005
region which is mostly going to be

6027.48 --> 6031.739
helium and hydrogen but it's going to

6029.699 --> 6034.5599999999995
sit there separately and be a shield

6031.739 --> 6036.78
against the Rays from that blah blah

6034.56 --> 6037.52
blah [ __ ] yeah oh and here we have

6036.78 --> 6041.179
the

6037.52 --> 6044.639
thermosphere it's a super dangerous part

6041.179 --> 6048.42
that's like underneath the ozone layer

6044.639 --> 6050.6990000000005
is it above it I don't know man and if

6048.42 --> 6052.56
things yeah things Rockets go through

6050.699 --> 6054.9
there and then it gets you need a heat

6052.56 --> 6055.8
shield no yes yes of course so there's

6054.9 --> 6058.32
things

6055.8 --> 6060.84
that move through it

6058.32 --> 6062.599999999999
become a thousand degrees so is there

6060.84 --> 6066.0
like a

6062.6 --> 6068.639
induction coil

6066.0 --> 6072.12
at that height that's just like you go

6068.639 --> 6075.3
through it you get fried you get like a

6072.12 --> 6077.099999999999
micro and you become a fat like what the

6075.3 --> 6080.04
f what the [ __ ]

6077.1 --> 6083.6990000000005
who the hell believes that [ __ ]

6080.04 --> 6085.56
a thermosphere and things in there get a

6083.699 --> 6088.32
thousand degrees but that's surrounding

6085.56 --> 6090.780000000001
it okay right

6088.32 --> 6094.32
so

6090.78 --> 6095.94
how the hell did you figure that out

6094.32 --> 6098.099999999999
like

6095.94 --> 6099.9
send the balloon up and then at some

6098.1 --> 6102.119000000001
point they hit the thermosphere and then

6099.9 --> 6105.239
they just melt and shrivel up and then

6102.119 --> 6108.9
they fall down like what what

6105.239 --> 6111.54
like it breaks my head what the [ __ ] is

6108.9 --> 6113.759999999999
a thermosphere why does anybody believe

6111.54 --> 6116.04
that's real and why do you believe

6113.76 --> 6118.7390000000005
there's an ozone layer of denser gas

6116.04 --> 6119.88
that sits in between less dense gas like

6118.739 --> 6121.678999999999
a layer

6119.88 --> 6125.34
of gas

6121.679 --> 6127.4400000000005
a gas layer in between other gas yeah

6125.34 --> 6129.78
gas doesn't layer it spreads out in all

6127.44 --> 6132.599999999999
directions it mix up an M6

6129.78 --> 6135.659
it's average density

6132.6 --> 6138.0
it's not gonna sit in a singular layer

6135.659 --> 6140.28
in the midst of less dense gas it's

6138.0 --> 6141.659
absolutely insane why people think

6140.28 --> 6144.239
that's possible

6141.659 --> 6146.82
why

6144.239 --> 6148.619
and QE of all people why the hell do you

6146.82 --> 6150.179
believe in the thermosphere it makes no

6148.619 --> 6153.139
sense

6150.179 --> 6153.139
I don't get it

6167.84 --> 6175.219
okay cheese McDuck what the [ __ ] that's

6171.48 --> 6175.218999999999
a really [ __ ] up story dude

6181.98 --> 6184.699
what

6190.98 --> 6196.379999999999
I've never heard of that could you send

6194.219 --> 6198.78
me like an email with some photo with

6196.38 --> 6201.179
that or something she

6198.78 --> 6203.04
Cheech I've never that's really bizarre

6201.179 --> 6208.58
so you guys are saying that there's

6203.04 --> 6208.58
actually like a giant oven above there

6209.6 --> 6214.08
that the thermosphere is not a sphere

6212.4 --> 6216.299999999999
but that there's actually like an

6214.08 --> 6220.08
incinerator layer and if you really go

6216.3 --> 6223.6990000000005
up there you become incinerated

6220.08 --> 6223.699
is that really up there

6224.219 --> 6228.06
yeah Apollo missions would have a

6226.739 --> 6230.82
problem yeah no [ __ ] with those

6228.06 --> 6234.84
temperatures like dude the hobo Fortress

6230.82 --> 6237.659
it would have shriveled up in a second

6234.84 --> 6240.179
I mean how do you think gold foil is

6237.659 --> 6242.759999999999
gonna handle going through a thousand

6240.179 --> 6244.32
degrees Yeah it's not like a solid

6242.76 --> 6249.02
plating

6244.32 --> 6249.0199999999995
it's foil how the [ __ ]

6254.159 --> 6257.48
the whole thing's insane

6259.98 --> 6266.699
it's radiation up there that's that's

6263.4 --> 6268.5599999999995
absolute [ __ ] and yeah Martin

6266.699 --> 6271.94
flattered reddish

6268.56 --> 6275.159000000001
brings out the worst conspiratorial

6271.94 --> 6278.879999999999
nonsense grafted grafted stories that

6275.159 --> 6281.879999999999
have ever come across so yeah Cheech

6278.88 --> 6283.9800000000005
I mean oh Martin letter of British said

6281.88 --> 6287.54
it yeah well that usually means it's

6283.98 --> 6287.54
completely made up or [ __ ]

6290.04 --> 6295.26
not that I don't like Martin I mean it's

6293.1 --> 6299.219
kind of fun to hang around sometimes but

6295.26 --> 6302.84
he talks absolute hard [ __ ]

6299.219 --> 6302.84
he makes up nonsense

6314.28 --> 6318.8
I didn't know that okay well yeah it's

6316.56 --> 6318.8
just

6320.219 --> 6324.4800000000005
he'll bring up things to tent later

6322.44 --> 6327.119
thoughts

6324.48 --> 6331.08
I mean dude hey you see if he's got some

6327.119 --> 6332.759999999999
sourcing right or if he just said it on

6331.08 --> 6335.159
his stream that doesn't mean anything if

6332.76 --> 6336.900000000001
he's got actual sourcing for that

6335.159 --> 6338.759999999999
it's like oh no no here's the actual

6336.9 --> 6341.099999999999
news article and

6338.76 --> 6343.320000000001
like that really happened then it's a

6341.1 --> 6345.360000000001
different matter

6343.32 --> 6348.179
but there's plenty of times where he

6345.36 --> 6350.099999999999
just makes up [ __ ]

6348.179 --> 6354.26
and then moves on never mentions it

6350.1 --> 6354.26
again he likes to mix up [ __ ] so

6360.42 --> 6364.1990000000005
but hey if you got some more sourcing

6362.52 --> 6366.06
for that story that will be very

6364.199 --> 6367.678999999999
interesting maybe there is a

6366.06 --> 6369.780000000001
thermosphere it's not going to be a

6367.679 --> 6371.639
thermal layer

6369.78 --> 6373.199
where it's just like yeah everything

6371.639 --> 6375.8
that goes in there it becomes

6373.199 --> 6375.799999999999
incinerated

6375.9 --> 6382.379999999999
but that doesn't really make any sense

6379.08 --> 6385.08
though with the gradiation of the gas

6382.38 --> 6388.02
that is here within the realm you see if

6385.08 --> 6390.78
there was a really hot layer up there

6388.02 --> 6393.3
that would literally then cause the gas

6390.78 --> 6398.42
within there to expand

6393.3 --> 6398.42
and that would ruin the gradation effect

6399.719 --> 6405.2390000000005
that is here that's that has built over

6402.84 --> 6406.9800000000005
time right because you need a cold

6405.239 --> 6409.5
element above

6406.98 --> 6412.08
and the hot the heat below if there's a

6409.5 --> 6415.02
thousand degree layer up there it's

6412.08 --> 6416.82
gonna it's gonna Warp

6415.02 --> 6420.7390000000005
the gradient

6416.82 --> 6420.739
of the gas pressure within the realm

6420.96 --> 6426.6
so I find it extremely unlikely that

6423.84 --> 6429.54
that's actually real

6426.6 --> 6432.3
but hey if you gotta got more leads

6429.54 --> 6435.36
actual research

6432.3 --> 6438.2390000000005
then yeah maybe I'll dig into that then

6435.36 --> 6440.839999999999
but on the surface it just seems like a

6438.239 --> 6440.839999999999
nonsense story

6444.9 --> 6451.219
Russian newspaper clipping

6447.96 --> 6451.219
was it in Russian

6452.58 --> 6456.199
Could you actually read it

6467.28 --> 6473.34
and like why why would they even do that

6469.619 --> 6476.099999999999
why would they need somebody in there to

6473.34 --> 6478.1990000000005
send it over in there

6476.1 --> 6481.320000000001
if the device

6478.199 --> 6483.239
itself would be able to pick up gigantic

6481.32 --> 6485.759999999999
amounts of heat why would you send a

6483.239 --> 6488.94
person in it

6485.76 --> 6493.280000000001
I mean don't you send a probe first

6488.94 --> 6493.28
you're gonna go into Uncharted Territory

6494.58 --> 6499.739
unless it's not regular heat it's just

6497.28 --> 6503.46
like a weird microwave heat that only

6499.739 --> 6505.919999999999
like blows up water or something

6503.46 --> 6507.6
right if it's just gigantic microwave

6505.92 --> 6509.04
like you're literally going in a

6507.6 --> 6511.9800000000005
microwave yeah that's going to boil the

6509.04 --> 6513.9
water so you're just gonna

6511.98 --> 6515.58
boil the water right and and other

6513.9 --> 6517.98
things might not be affected although

6515.58 --> 6519.78
yeah well all metals would also be

6517.98 --> 6521.638999999999
affected if you put metal in the

6519.78 --> 6523.5
microwave you know

6521.639 --> 6525.719
so it's just

6523.5 --> 6527.4
I don't see any logical reason why they

6525.719 --> 6529.86
would have done that in the first place

6527.4 --> 6533.0
it and that's what makes me think it's

6529.86 --> 6533.0
just a nonsense story

6534.98 --> 6539.82
they send dogs for well did they get

6537.6 --> 6543.139
roasted dogs back

6539.82 --> 6543.139
Ares 106.

6544.5 --> 6548.159
this is like oh yeah oh wow they

6546.119 --> 6550.799999999999
definitely roasted okay well now let's

6548.159 --> 6552.239
try it with a human being

6550.8 --> 6555.320000000001
but

6552.239 --> 6555.32
he's gonna roast

6555.36 --> 6558.9
yeah but we gotta try it right we tried

6557.52 --> 6561.3
the dogs first now we're gonna try

6558.9 --> 6563.9
humans like what

6561.3 --> 6567.2390000000005
talking about

6563.9 --> 6569.699
this is all getting really weird

6567.239 --> 6571.44
the dogs were fine but the human when

6569.699 --> 6573.9
they send it up the same height he got

6571.44 --> 6576.659
roasted did he

6573.9 --> 6579.0
what the [ __ ]

6576.659 --> 6581.4
as I don't think that those stories are

6579.0 --> 6583.199
compatible or I think Aries 106 I think

6581.4 --> 6585.5
that you're not talking about the same

6583.199 --> 6585.5
thing

6586.04 --> 6592.28
at all as what Cheech McDuck here was

6589.8 --> 6592.28
talking about

6606.84 --> 6612.26
not sure now okay

6609.42 --> 6612.26
that's all right

6614.04 --> 6618.0
I mean

6615.719 --> 6621.2390000000005
I figured out very quickly that it was

6618.0 --> 6623.46
talking nonsense on his shows

6621.239 --> 6625.08
but it's still kind of entertaining to

6623.46 --> 6627.42
hang around it's just like you're at the

6625.08 --> 6629.94
pub and somebody's just kind of making

6627.42 --> 6632.88
[ __ ] stories

6629.94 --> 6635.46
still very entertaining and he will

6632.88 --> 6637.619
still just shove things in your face

6635.46 --> 6639.42
that are curious but it's like yeah when

6637.619 --> 6641.46
I watch those things I don't listen to

6639.42 --> 6642.36
what Martin says I just look at it and

6641.46 --> 6644.88
then

6642.36 --> 6645.78
say what I see in it in the chat or

6644.88 --> 6649.619
something

6645.78 --> 6654.739
because Martin's opinions are

6649.619 --> 6654.739
not exactly uh high standard

6655.26 --> 6658.9400000000005
just like funny

6660.44 --> 6664.638999999999
Tavern commentary or something

6667.86 --> 6670.339999999999
whatever

6671.28 --> 6677.159
I mean I still I like Martin as a guy

6674.94 --> 6679.879999999999
but I'm not gonna listen to his [ __ ]

6677.159 --> 6679.879999999999
stories though

6687.13 --> 6693.0
[Music]

6689.82 --> 6695.04
crap is moving so fast in atmosphere

6693.0 --> 6697.56
yeah but the atmosphere is extremely low

6695.04 --> 6701.179
so it can't really be moving that fast

6697.56 --> 6701.179
and still create that friction

6704.48 --> 6710.339999999999
dude you could go like

6707.28 --> 6711.96
a hundred times the speed of sound if

6710.34 --> 6716.1
you just if you're just going through

6711.96 --> 6718.08
helium and hydrogen at a very thin

6716.1 --> 6720.4800000000005
very thinned out

6718.08 --> 6722.88
nothing's going to happen you're

6720.48 --> 6725.638999999999
literally going to reach Earth very

6722.88 --> 6728.1
quickly before you can even

6725.639 --> 6731.159000000001
build up enough friction to get that hot

6728.1 --> 6732.780000000001
the entire idea of oh re-entry we're

6731.159 --> 6737.879999999999
going through

6732.78 --> 6740.219
the heat is such unbelievable stupid

6737.88 --> 6745.04
[ __ ]

6740.219 --> 6745.04
it's so [ __ ] dumb it's unbelievable

6747.739 --> 6753.839999999999
that that never happens

6751.139 --> 6755.46
get it it never happens

6753.84 --> 6758.159000000001
ever

6755.46 --> 6761.1
the only reason why there is even a

6758.159 --> 6763.0199999999995
story like that to begin with is based

6761.1 --> 6765.4800000000005
on these weird

6763.02 --> 6769.320000000001
apparent meteor sightings right it's

6765.48 --> 6771.119
like oh it's the thing

6769.32 --> 6774.719
and it's like whoa what is that a meteor

6771.119 --> 6775.98
oh wow it it burned up in the atmosphere

6774.719 --> 6780.42
yeah

6775.98 --> 6783.419999999999
that's where that entire reasoning

6780.42 --> 6786.3
comes from it's all based on oh there is

6783.42 --> 6788.04
it a falling star it and then the story

6786.3 --> 6790.02
about how it's burning up that's where

6788.04 --> 6792.0
they get it from because there is no

6790.02 --> 6794.580000000001
actual thing

6792.0 --> 6797.4
that ever happens

6794.58 --> 6801.0599999999995
where you go through air so fast you

6797.4 --> 6803.659
burn up it's harsh [ __ ] of epic

6801.06 --> 6803.659000000001
proportions

6804.179 --> 6810.06
horseshit

6806.4 --> 6812.159
nothing ever does that nothing literally

6810.06 --> 6814.4400000000005
Burns

6812.159 --> 6817.92
like heat Burns

6814.44 --> 6820.138999999999
through friction through atmosphere no

6817.92 --> 6822.179
matter how thick you're even gonna make

6820.139 --> 6824.400000000001
that atmosphere right I mean if you have

6822.179 --> 6826.139
like extreme pressure and extreme speeds

6824.4 --> 6828.239
you could imagine like well maybe then a

6826.139 --> 6829.92
lot of Richter would well no it's not

6828.239 --> 6833.459999999999
gonna happen though because the Heat's

6829.92 --> 6835.38
gonna immediately just vent off it's

6833.46 --> 6837.179
gonna rub off on the gas and that's just

6835.38 --> 6839.88
gonna expand the [ __ ] away from you and

6837.179 --> 6841.679
it's not actually gonna heat you up that

6839.88 --> 6844.219
much

6841.679 --> 6844.219
never

6844.26 --> 6849.06
yeah the only way you're gonna actually

6846.3 --> 6853.1990000000005
get friction heat you know how that is

6849.06 --> 6856.92
it's not robbing something against gas

6853.199 --> 6860.759999999999
it's rubbing something against something

6856.92 --> 6862.679
else another solid thing yeah that's

6860.76 --> 6865.26
where the real friction comes from that

6862.679 --> 6868.4400000000005
creates real Heat

6865.26 --> 6872.219
that never happens by going through gas

6868.44 --> 6874.86
it's an idiotic notion idiotic of epic

6872.219 --> 6877.199
proportions and it's completely spread

6874.86 --> 6878.46
out in people's minds everybody's just

6877.199 --> 6881.099999999999
assuming it

6878.46 --> 6883.26
it's so nonsensical like

6881.1 --> 6886.1990000000005
this has gone even under the radar for a

6883.26 --> 6888.42
general flat earthers they just

6886.199 --> 6890.159
because it's all just about oh falling

6888.42 --> 6891.659
star oh look it's oh it's what's

6890.159 --> 6893.58
happening to that why did it go away

6891.659 --> 6895.379999999999
well it's because it's burning up in the

6893.58 --> 6898.0199999999995
atmosphere

6895.38 --> 6900.96
and that's where it all comes from that

6898.02 --> 6903.119000000001
entire nonsense speculation based on

6900.96 --> 6905.46
seeing a freaking falling star assuming

6903.119 --> 6907.08
it's burning up in the atmosphere and

6905.46 --> 6909.54
then saying oh well then there has to be

6907.08 --> 6911.28
some mechanism for things to burn up in

6909.54 --> 6914.04
the atmosphere because the meteors are

6911.28 --> 6917.159
doing that because we presuppose it so

6914.04 --> 6918.6
that means now that spaceships that

6917.159 --> 6920.28
re-enter the atmosphere just like

6918.6 --> 6923.280000000001
meteors they're gonna burn for a bit

6920.28 --> 6925.199
because that happens because we

6923.28 --> 6927.42
presuppose that that is what happens

6925.199 --> 6929.219
with meteors and that there are things

6927.42 --> 6931.9400000000005
that do that

6929.219 --> 6935.42
and so it's been grafted into the entire

6931.94 --> 6935.419999999999
space lore

6935.46 --> 6938.119
huh

6939.06 --> 6945.119000000001
foreign

6941.58 --> 6947.94
but I'm gonna round out the show

6945.119 --> 6950.839999999999
on Flat Earth on the subject of Flat

6947.94 --> 6950.839999999999
Earth how about that

6953.88 --> 6958.38
I want an extra title it

6956.219 --> 6960.92
because that was a good thing offense

6958.38 --> 6960.92
pants

6966.04 --> 6969.14
[Music]

6972.45 --> 6978.0
[Applause]

6980.13 --> 6990.829
[Music]

6991.44 --> 7000.638999999999
yeah igna ignition

6995.639 --> 7000.639
through atmospheric friction is nonsense

7004.34 --> 7008.679
there you go now I got it complete

7008.78 --> 7013.82
right so thanks everyone for coming I

7011.48 --> 7015.86
hope you like this show if you did then

Earth early bird number 1528

7052.88 --> 7057.679
on a Friday and I'm gonna join the Flat

7055.34 --> 7060.26
Earth debates over at Nathan Oakley 1980

7057.679 --> 7065.5
Channel this is already started up

7060.26 --> 7065.5
and until the next video keep it flat

7065.53 --> 7075.69
