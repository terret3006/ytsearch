171.159 --> 173.92
starting to come

176.519 --> 183.68

183.68 --> 190.4

more sunny tomorrow which is

238.72 --> 244.0
nice

240.879 --> 244.0
looking forward to that

245.519 --> 248.519
again

253.44 --> 256.639
[Music]

259.799 --> 263.15999999999997
right so

263.32 --> 269.8
yeah had

265.44 --> 272.24
really really curious dream last night

269.8 --> 272.24
kind of

279.199 --> 286.36
unique it was it was really curious I've

282.919 --> 286.35999999999996
never had a dream like this one

287.6 --> 295.44
before I dream like I was invited over

293.32 --> 297.8
at a

295.44 --> 300.56
factory from Elon

297.8 --> 302.56
Musk and Elon Musk was in the dream this

300.56 --> 304.199
is the first time ever I actually dreamt

302.56 --> 306.759
about that

304.199 --> 309.639
guy that was really

306.759 --> 312.40000000000003
weird but it got even

309.639 --> 315.199
weirder because like as it was going

312.4 --> 319.52
around and noticed like it wasn't really

315.199 --> 320.8
any real factory it was the idea of a

319.52 --> 323.71999999999997
factory and there were like all these

320.8 --> 326.639
moving things everywhere including on

323.72 --> 328.52000000000004
the floor which when you analyze it was

326.639 --> 330.639
like really dangerous and hazardous

328.52 --> 334.12
actually so it's definitely not a real

330.639 --> 335.84000000000003
factory it was the idea of

334.12 --> 340.319
it

335.84 --> 344.19899999999996
and I basically like started to to avoid

340.319 --> 347.91900000000004
these hazards going around there I

344.199 --> 351.039
started to float

347.919 --> 353.68
fly it's like to not get my feet caught

351.039 --> 355.759
up in all these moving things like

353.68 --> 358.8
moving plates that were happening and I

355.759 --> 360.24
was just walking around but like what

358.8 --> 362.0
there was this Danger that like your

360.24 --> 364.44
foot could get caught and crushed or

362.0 --> 366.599
whatever so I basically like retracted

364.44 --> 371.479
my feet and then hovered and then I

366.599 --> 371.479
realized like yeah I'm actually kind of

371.72 --> 380.639
flying and then I like told Elon Musk

375.4 --> 383.12
like hey look see I can just fly there

380.639 --> 386.0
something I can do like yeah people have

383.12 --> 387.639
all these magical abilities and all that

386.0 --> 390.4
and

387.639 --> 392.96000000000004
he like was just staring staring at me

390.4 --> 396.479
like what the

392.96 --> 399.52
hell and usually I don't even have like

396.479 --> 403.4
a a human response

399.52 --> 406.0
from things from other people in

403.4 --> 410.28
dreams and I just noticed

406.0 --> 412.72
that he seemed to get like baffled and a

410.28 --> 414.75899999999996
little bit afraid about

412.72 --> 418.199
it he got

414.759 --> 420.40000000000003
scared from just me being there and just

418.199 --> 423.36
flying out of nowhere didn't like know

420.4 --> 425.63899999999995
how to address it and could barely it

423.36 --> 430.319
was really

425.639 --> 432.639
curious really really strange that

430.319 --> 434.03900000000004
dream I mean it was weird enough that I

432.639 --> 439.199
actually

434.039 --> 442.36
dreamt with Elon Musk in the dream like

439.199 --> 445.72
what but then also like hey Elon I can

442.36 --> 448.52000000000004
actually fly see people have these

445.72 --> 453.12
dormant magical abilities

448.52 --> 455.039
that like you can just use and all that

453.12 --> 457.759
and then his like baffled response it

455.039 --> 460.36
wasn't like in denial about it he just

457.759 --> 463.36
like didn't know what to think about it

460.36 --> 463.36
and it made him really

463.56 --> 468.479
nervous it's one of the strangest dreams

466.4 --> 470.79999999999995
I've ever had I've never had a dream

468.479 --> 470.8
like

471.28 --> 477.67999999999995
this but here's the thing the weird

474.36 --> 480.24
thing was that also I woke up after that

477.68 --> 482.84000000000003
dream cuz I just became like really

480.24 --> 485.039
conscious about it what was going on and

482.84 --> 488.23999999999995
like really conscious about the flying

485.039 --> 491.479
and but I woke up like in a

488.24 --> 495.759
sweat which is very

491.479 --> 500.44
strange like never had that before

495.759 --> 503.759
either like in in a long time so

500.44 --> 503.759
yeah very

506.639 --> 516.12
odd so got that story to start out

511.32 --> 516.12
with like weird

525.12 --> 532.88
dream and I'm still like sitting on it

529.279 --> 532.88
like what was

535.64 --> 542.64
that why did I dream about Elon Musk

540.32 --> 542.6400000000001
so

557.64 --> 564.519
strange

560.24 --> 564.519
yeah anyway

565.48 --> 571.24
uh yeah today like with all that I

568.88 --> 574.6
didn't really like today's a different

571.24 --> 576.04
day and I don't know maybe I feel like

574.6 --> 579.9590000000001
there's

576.04 --> 582.12
the spring physiological transitioning

579.959 --> 584.68
like settled in it might be part of like

582.12 --> 588.32
why I woke up in a sweat and all that

584.68 --> 591.76
and if like feel my jaw again all of a

588.32 --> 593.0
sudden which is I guess it is the time

591.76 --> 595.959
halfway

593.0 --> 600.04
March it did sort of happen last year as

595.959 --> 602.16
well it's not too bothersome but I feel

600.04 --> 604.399
like suddenly the bacteria and

602.16 --> 606.8389999999999
everything have waken woken up and are

604.399 --> 610.48
like doing

606.839 --> 614.72
stuff but I feel overall pretty good

610.48 --> 614.72
very glad that I'm not smoking cannabis

616.6 --> 621.279
anymore CU that would probably not

619.12 --> 626.2
really help at

621.279 --> 626.2
all like last year was like quite a

626.44 --> 631.12
hassle around this time I got like

628.92 --> 633.24
really sick and it hurt and all that and

631.12 --> 636.36
and doesn't feel like that

633.24 --> 639.5600000000001
now so but yeah the spring has

636.36 --> 642.0
definitely arrived let me show you my

639.56 --> 643.03
rosemary plant which is like now

642.0 --> 646.1

right so yesterday what did I do I had

759.48 --> 765.399
a yeah yeah Owen Benjamin was there I

762.16 --> 768.399
had a phone call with my friend in

765.399 --> 771.72
who had some

768.399 --> 773.8
things like she's getting over

771.72 --> 777.519
relationship which is kind of tough on

773.8 --> 780.199
her and like needs to talk about it so

777.519 --> 781.92
I'm there for her as she has been for me

780.199 --> 783.68
like when I went through my whole Panic

781.92 --> 786.3199999999999
phase in the last

783.68 --> 790.56
month a you're good oh that's great to

786.32 --> 793.1600000000001
hear I'm very glad keep it up Spring is

790.56 --> 793.16
right around the

794.0 --> 797.0
corner

799.519 --> 804.839
uh oh

801.959 --> 807.6389999999999
Benjamin also was interesting a bit

804.839 --> 807.639
short but

808.12 --> 812.44
interesting

809.92 --> 815.4799999999999
I stayed up kind of late last night like

812.44 --> 818.32
past 3 even also because I had like a

815.48 --> 823.399
conversation with somebody on

818.32 --> 823.399
Skype went in a like a pretty deep

826.56 --> 831.7589999999999
dive so that might also have something

828.959 --> 833.68
to do with me having a weird dream and

831.759 --> 836.6
waking up sweaty or something I'm not

833.68 --> 839.3199999999999
used to like going to bed like that

836.6 --> 840.8000000000001
late so going to definitely try try to

839.32 --> 844.0
go to bed a little bit

840.8 --> 844.0
earlier this

844.56 --> 851.16
evening hopefully things will be just

849.0 --> 853.44
fine especially if tomorrow's going to

851.16 --> 856.279
be nice weather

853.44 --> 860.0400000000001
again

856.279 --> 866.72
uh Benjamin is like really going yeah he

860.04 --> 869.36
had that show with the supposed Muslim

866.72 --> 873.1600000000001
guy called Daniel or something on

869.36 --> 878.6800000000001
YouTube who was like really kind of

873.16 --> 878.68
dubious had like a lot of weird sjw

879.04 --> 885.8
style opinions and all that which is

882.44 --> 888.72
like dubious and a little bit suspect

885.8 --> 891.5999999999999
and Owen's like really like addressing

888.72 --> 895.279
that basically like hey there's these

891.6 --> 897.6800000000001
people that say they're Muslims and but

895.279 --> 900.6
they're like

897.68 --> 903.4799999999999
really like they don't really feel like

900.6 --> 906.44
they're like the right like the right

903.48 --> 908.759
way and so his show was like mostly

906.44 --> 911.24
about that

908.759 --> 914.88
yesterday interesting something to chew

911.24 --> 919.8
on hey borders boy good to see you

914.88 --> 919.8
again good today okay good to

924.24 --> 930.199
you yeah borders boy I checked out the

927.279 --> 932.759
thanks for the link

930.199 --> 935.7199999999999
that you sent me after the show it was

932.759 --> 937.6800000000001
pretty good I did find like a type of

935.72 --> 940.6
shoe there and then they're in the

937.68 --> 942.6389999999999
Netherlands as well that are like very

940.6 --> 944.5600000000001
close to the type of shoes that I have

942.639 --> 947.72
not exactly but

944.56 --> 949.88
like if I really need replacement they

947.72 --> 953.88
would do

949.88 --> 956.4399999999999
it so it's good to have like a a source

953.88 --> 959.639
where I could potentially get new

956.44 --> 964.839
shoes at some point once I can actually

959.639 --> 967.45
afford it which is not anytime soon but

964.839 --> 969.2790000000001
maybe later in the year or something who

967.45 --> 972.12
[Music]

969.279 --> 975.079
knows right it's just I'm glad that it

972.12 --> 978.759
something is still out

975.079 --> 982.7199999999999
there man I have a low voice today don't

978.759 --> 984.9590000000001
I wonder where that came from maybe also

982.72 --> 987.0790000000001
like bacterial

984.959 --> 990.92
transition I just feel like I went

987.079 --> 990.92
through this transformation this night

993.68 --> 997.56
and I'm hearing like some other friends

996.0 --> 1000.12
of

997.56 --> 1003.959
mine like they're suddenly getting colds

1000.12 --> 1006.72
and all that so I was already like oh

1003.959 --> 1009.7199999999999
okay it's coming and I'm not getting a

1006.72 --> 1014.12
cold but I am like noticing hey there's

1009.72 --> 1014.12
some stuff happening inside of

1016.279 --> 1021.8
me right also watch a video clutch

1019.6 --> 1024.799
posted the early word

1021.8 --> 1029.039
chat about

1024.799 --> 1029.039
Solitude very interesting little

1030.039 --> 1039.839
video I'd say very applicable to my

1035.679 --> 1039.8390000000002
life I'll share that with you

1040.48 --> 1047.84
guys from The Academy of ideas

1045.44 --> 1050.8400000000001
[Music]

1047.84 --> 1050.84
Channel

1057.44 --> 1062.559
all right so yeah that definitely

1059.919 --> 1062.5590000000002
applies to

1062.6 --> 1069.8799999999999
me so another person I applied the

1065.36 --> 1072.559
technique to which show remain

1069.88 --> 1076.72
unnamed and that also

1072.559 --> 1080.6399999999999
worked and had a discussion with the guy

1076.72 --> 1083.48
I know through Omen Benjamin on D

1080.64 --> 1083.48
about Dungeons and

1085.4 --> 1091.4
Dragons which made me kind of nostalgic

1088.4 --> 1095.4
back to like the whole group that I was

1091.4 --> 1099.3600000000001
with and how that like tragically broke

1095.4 --> 1102.159
up in 2020 I mean it really did it was a

1099.36 --> 1103.8799999999999
tragedy I hope they're even still alive

1102.159 --> 1104.919
this there might be chance that they're

1103.88 --> 1107.7600000000002
not

1104.919 --> 1111.2
because they were

1107.76 --> 1113.84
taking the Jabs as far as I know even

1111.2 --> 1116.76
though I like beg them not to do that

1113.84 --> 1120.9599999999998
literally beg them because I mean they

1116.76 --> 1123.96
were like pretty much my closest friends

1120.96 --> 1126.52
that I would meet on a weekly basis for

1123.96 --> 1126.52
5 years

1128.08 --> 1133.84
straight makes me again feel like oh man

1132.36 --> 1136.12
we

1133.84 --> 1139.559
just like the

1136.12 --> 1144.0
campaign ended in the middle

1139.559 --> 1148.039
of like a of like the Pinnacle of a

1144.0 --> 1151.64
unrolling of a a war

1148.039 --> 1154.919
situation like to explain

1151.64 --> 1157.3600000000001
it a lot of stuff had happened like a

1154.919 --> 1160.039
epic

1157.36 --> 1163.6
character came facing one of the players

1160.039 --> 1167.64
which was a like a long-standing plot

1163.6 --> 1169.6789999999999
point it literally exploded which like

1167.64 --> 1173.64
split the mountain something like a

1169.679 --> 1176.4
dramatic earthquake that made hammers

1173.64 --> 1178.919
Landing the great city of the dwarfs

1176.4 --> 1183.72
which is like old and kind of

1178.919 --> 1185.72
like getting Dusty a bit like break

1183.72 --> 1188.96
apart like it it

1185.72 --> 1191.96
basically like wrecked the dwarfen

1188.96 --> 1194.08
civilization there and then the dark

1191.96 --> 1197.3600000000001
elves which were like waiting for that

1194.08 --> 1200.1589999999999
to happen came falling in and just

1197.36 --> 1204.1589999999999
started to rush

1200.159 --> 1207.7600000000002
to try and like completely destroy the

1204.159 --> 1210.48
dwarfen civilization there and they came

1207.76 --> 1213.36
after it like the

1210.48 --> 1217.48
players heard about it took the signal

1213.36 --> 1219.799
and basically got in TR like noticed it

1217.48 --> 1222.88
like holy [Â __Â ] like the entire city is

1219.799 --> 1226.32
like just completely shifted like it

1222.88 --> 1228.3600000000001
didn't even look the way it did the Big

1226.32 --> 1230.1589999999999
Church of the dwarves like a really

1228.36 --> 1234.1589999999999
important important place was just

1230.159 --> 1238.5200000000002
completely gone it was completely

1234.159 --> 1240.7990000000002
destroyed nothing left very dramatic and

1238.52 --> 1244.24
they were like rushing to try to find

1240.799 --> 1247.72
and save the emperor before the before

1244.24 --> 1251.1200000000001
the Dr the dark elves would get to them

1247.72 --> 1253.919
meeting up with other Dwarven Soldier

1251.12 --> 1256.559
groups and then then it and then it

1253.919 --> 1259.6000000000001
halted like basically right before they

1256.559 --> 1261.52
got there which is like ah

1259.6 --> 1264.24
oh man that would have been so epic

1261.52 --> 1266.6
because I had this whole like

1264.24 --> 1269.039
interdimensional sort of like semi

1266.6 --> 1272.039
Divine situation that was going to

1269.039 --> 1276.1589999999999
happen and like it never happened such a

1272.039 --> 1279.0
tragedy for that story development and I

1276.159 --> 1280.64
had that was just basically the end of

1279.0 --> 1285.08
chapter

1280.64 --> 1287.2
one I had like 10 years worth of

1285.08 --> 1290.6399999999999
material

1287.2 --> 1293.559
left to continue with after and it just

1290.64 --> 1293.5590000000002
never got there

1295.12 --> 1303.76
and maybe I will try to like

1298.96 --> 1303.76
get try to get the players back together

1303.96 --> 1309.799
again but like none of them have really

1307.159 --> 1312.7990000000002
like returned phone calls and all

1309.799 --> 1312.799
that

1317.52 --> 1323.32
unfortunately hello moon rover and

1321.039 --> 1326.72
dupons level

1323.32 --> 1326.72
bear who are

1328.24 --> 1331.359
[Music]

1332.0 --> 1338.96
you okay account made

1334.84 --> 1343.1999999999998
today so do I know you from

1338.96 --> 1343.2
somewhere hello clutch good to see

1344.47 --> 1350.52
[Music]

1347.52 --> 1350.52
you

1365.12 --> 1369.7199999999998
you don't think so hello

1377.44 --> 1381.24
Richard I don't know

1384.0 --> 1390.48
clutch it like it wasn't the only issue

1386.88 --> 1392.24
though like they had they were kind of

1390.48 --> 1394.799
like

1392.24 --> 1399.24
sjw influenced in

1394.799 --> 1399.24
ways and I had already

1399.72 --> 1405.679
like showed my inner workings a bit and

1403.679 --> 1407.44
there was some friction concerning that

1405.679 --> 1409.96
as

1407.44 --> 1413.72
well

1409.96 --> 1416.44
and it it felt like the whole Co

1413.72 --> 1419.44
situation was kind of

1416.44 --> 1421.44
the the drop that made them decide to

1419.44 --> 1426.0
like discontinue or

1421.44 --> 1426.0
something they used it as an excuse I

1437.44 --> 1441.64
felt

1439.52 --> 1443.679
yeah whatever moon rover I don't need

1441.64 --> 1446.039
that I don't I'm not going to discuss

1443.679 --> 1449.8400000000001
that ah yeah yeah that will not be

1446.039 --> 1453.679
discussed on this show not in the chat

1449.84 --> 1456.799
ever ever again I'm just referencing it

1453.679 --> 1458.72
because of the time situation back then

1456.799 --> 1462.12
not going to make any claims or any

1458.72 --> 1462.1200000000001
references ever

1462.52 --> 1467.36
again and if somebody insists on doing

1465.32 --> 1471.76
that they will get

1467.36 --> 1474.36
banned yeah there's still now videos

1471.76 --> 1476.64
being taken down from me in the past

1474.36 --> 1480.6399999999999
because I brought these things up so it

1476.64 --> 1482.88
simply will never be discussed again on

1480.64 --> 1482.88
this

1484.24 --> 1488.96
channel you want to chat about it I'll

1486.679 --> 1490.24
talk about it over Skype or whatever

1488.96 --> 1493.039
that's

1490.24 --> 1494.64
cute but uh it will not be discussed on

1493.039 --> 1496.919
this channel and there's no more need

1494.64 --> 1500.2
anyway I mean it's all out in the open

1496.919 --> 1501.7990000000002
there's no more mysteries about it but

1500.2 --> 1506.44
there is a big

1501.799 --> 1506.44
Crackdown through social media

1506.88 --> 1514.159

1519.64 --> 1526.039
anybody that doesn't know about what was

1522.399 --> 1526.039
what and what it turned out to

1527.08 --> 1531.0
be so so there's no need in discussing

1529.6 --> 1533.84
it at

1531.0 --> 1536.84
all especially on my

1533.84 --> 1536.84

anything but I was not fight about

1681.64 --> 1686.279
it and I mean yeah

1686.32 --> 1690.84
there's what's going to happen sooner or

1688.88 --> 1694.5590000000002
later I

1690.84 --> 1697.72
mean floid is like drifting off into

1694.559 --> 1700.6399999999999
like Mordor so with all everything he's

1697.72 --> 1703.76
doing and some point Nathan was going to

1700.64 --> 1703.76
like address him over

1704.559 --> 1710.6789999999999
it and flat side was of course not not

1708.36 --> 1713.12
going to care about it so yeah I

1710.679 --> 1716.919
expected this to happen at some point

1713.12 --> 1716.9189999999999
actually happened a lot quicker than I

1721.88 --> 1726.279
expected okay clutch

1728.24 --> 1732.24
what there no need for

1733.399 --> 1736.399
that

1737.039 --> 1740.039
gross

1749.48 --> 1755.08
YouTube doing D and sketches I'm sure

1752.64 --> 1759.279
they do there's

1755.08 --> 1762.1589999999999
many DND related channels there's I

1759.279 --> 1765.039
found this group that even like

1762.159 --> 1769.0390000000002
does like Discord

1765.039 --> 1771.039
based uh D and D Adventure

1769.039 --> 1773.1589999999999
I'm a little hesitant to become part of

1771.039 --> 1775.32
that though but I am like looking at it

1773.159 --> 1777.7990000000002
at a distance and they're doing

1775.32 --> 1780.519
Pathfinder which is like

1777.799 --> 1784.2
N I have my own version of Dungeons and

1780.519 --> 1784.2
Dragons that I literally

1785.919 --> 1790.8400000000001
wrote called trolls and

1788.519 --> 1792.96
tyrants I mean I've brought that up on

1790.84 --> 1794.799
my show quite a few times it's also the

1792.96 --> 1800.039
system I've

1794.799 --> 1803.84
used for my own campaign

1800.039 --> 1807.559
and uh I don't know i' I'd love to like

1803.84 --> 1810.6399999999999
maybe at some point continue

1807.559 --> 1814.6
again with Dungeons and Dragons now

1810.64 --> 1818.1200000000001
especially because I got I'm sobered up

1814.6 --> 1820.36
I got Bas more time on my hands and I

1818.12 --> 1821.399
would be good to have like a face

1820.36 --> 1824.9599999999998
to-face

1821.399 --> 1824.9599999999998
friend group

1826.96 --> 1830.96
again

1828.799 --> 1833.519
it would be

1830.96 --> 1836.32
nice and by the way it was funny because

1833.519 --> 1840.039
that group was in I I did my face to

1836.32 --> 1840.039
face Dungeons and Dragons in

1842.12 --> 1845.12
English

1846.48 --> 1853.44
so I could also do it in Dutch but in

1849.32 --> 1853.4399999999998
English just like I'm used to

1856.919 --> 1859.919
that

1865.6 --> 1870.799
yo well debatable D it could have

1868.32 --> 1873.76
something to do that he doesn't trust

1870.799 --> 1878.679
nor really like

1873.76 --> 1878.679
you but maybe clutch is a little cranky

1886.919 --> 1889.919
today

1891.799 --> 1898.639
just try to take it easy I don't want

1894.44 --> 1898.6390000000001
any fights in my chat

1905.72 --> 1909.72
thanks hello dzak

1924.84 --> 1927.639
I got a Ty

1928.02 --> 1945.3899999999999
[Music]

1946.84 --> 1949.84
idea

1953.67 --> 1956.799
[Music]

1967.84 --> 1973.279
yeah let's start with that T it's it's

1969.96 --> 1975.76
silly but I mean it is the dream was

1973.279 --> 1979.36
silly so the title for now is I traed

1975.76 --> 1980.44
off Elon Musk and showed him I could fly

1979.36 --> 1984.76
that's kind of

1980.44 --> 1984.76
funny I'll see if I'll keep

1986.0 --> 1990.88
that did I learn to speak English at

1988.559 --> 1993.44
school no I learned

1990.88 --> 1995.72
English because of my own interest I

1993.44 --> 1997.559
basically started to learn English with

1995.72 --> 2001.72
from Saturday morning

1997.559 --> 2004.8799999999999
cartoons starting like when I was

2001.72 --> 2008.279
6 not seven

2004.88 --> 2010.279
probably it's just I watch this

2008.279 --> 2013.0
these cartoons Saturday

2010.279 --> 2016.72
morning and they were like awesome like

2013.0 --> 2019.08
Transformers G1 and all that and other

2016.72 --> 2022.24
stuff but they were all American they

2019.08 --> 2025.24
would just had the original American

2022.24 --> 2027.72
spoken soundtrack but with Dutch

2025.24 --> 2029.32
subtitles and so that was like oh I

2027.72 --> 2032.159
really want to learn

2029.32 --> 2034.72
this and it just motivated me like even

2032.159 --> 2038.8400000000001
before I had English in school to like

2034.72 --> 2041.96
try to like say like speak English try

2038.84 --> 2045.12
to get it right

2041.96 --> 2049.639
and and so I got a really Early Head

2045.12 --> 2053.159
Start with English very early and was

2049.639 --> 2055.44
very good at it as soon as we like had

2053.159 --> 2058.159
class everybody was

2055.44 --> 2059.7200000000003
like just like barely being able to

2058.159 --> 2062.9190000000003
pronounce things and with the Dutch

2059.72 --> 2066.0789999999997
accent and I would just like I'll just

2062.919 --> 2068.5989999999997
read it out and I'll like be fluid and

2066.079 --> 2070.96
have the accent even right

2068.599 --> 2072.96
so I just had a very Early Head Start I

2070.96 --> 2075.44
just always wanted to be able to speak

2072.96 --> 2075.44
very good

2077.159 --> 2082.2400000000002
English and we did not speak English at

2079.839 --> 2082.24
home at

2084.52 --> 2094.0
all my family was actually more about

2088.56 --> 2095.919
speaking I Dutch I quality

2094.0 --> 2099.0
Dutch

2095.919 --> 2101.48
so they work like they did train me a

2099.0 --> 2104.68
little bit about like pronunciation and

2101.48 --> 2106.8
articulation and all that but that was

2104.68 --> 2110.839
about

2106.8 --> 2113.2000000000003
Dutch Dutch accent can be quite interest

2110.839 --> 2116.839
I disagree I think it's extremely

2113.2 --> 2119.64
annoying but I know that foreigners are

2116.839 --> 2123.4
very Charmed by the Dutch

2119.64 --> 2126.64
accent I hate it I like every time I

2123.4 --> 2129.64
hear that I like I cringe over

2126.64 --> 2129.64
it

2144.93 --> 2152.719
[Music]

2153.2 --> 2157.839

2170.28 --> 2176.8390000000004
an I speak English perfectly including

2173.079 --> 2179.76
my accent thank you I do proud my pride

2176.839 --> 2184.7999999999997
myself for being able to do that and

2179.76 --> 2184.8
I've worked a lot to accomplish

2186.56 --> 2191.56
that

2188.8 --> 2194.7200000000003
arguably at this

2191.56 --> 2198.359
point in the last

2194.72 --> 2202.0
decade the ratio between how much

2198.359 --> 2206.0789999999997
English I've spoken and Dutch

2202.0 --> 2209.28
is roughly three quarters English and

2206.079 --> 2213.5600000000004
one quarter Dutch that's how much I've

2209.28 --> 2216.6400000000003
been speaking English because well most

2213.56 --> 2220.96
verbal contact I have has been online

2216.64 --> 2220.96
and that's all been English just all of

2222.319 --> 2226.68
it I mean when I go out there I don't

2224.88 --> 2228.76
really have a lot of elaborate

2226.68 --> 2232.359
conversations with Dutch people that I

2228.76 --> 2233.88
meet out there so it's just been I've

2232.359 --> 2237.7599999999998
been mostly talking

2233.88 --> 2237.76
English and I have had a lot of

2238.2 --> 2244.2
training

2239.76 --> 2247.6400000000003
like six to eight hours a

2244.2 --> 2250.72
day especially when I was still like in

2247.64 --> 2256.319
the Flat Earth of debates group

2250.72 --> 2260.359
because yeah it's just like English

2256.319 --> 2264.359
speaking an entire day like that like

2260.359 --> 2264.359
outside of the live shows and all

2269.2 --> 2273.52
that right and if that makes me Charming

2271.92 --> 2276.44
to the

2273.52 --> 2279.44
ladies that's

2276.44 --> 2279.44
cool

2298.28 --> 2303.3590000000004
I'm sure there's plenty of ladies that

2300.0 --> 2304.599
are like o that guy if only he wasn't a

2303.359 --> 2307.88
flat

2304.599 --> 2310.92
earther that makes it scary and weird

2307.88 --> 2310.92
and all these trolls

2311.119 --> 2317.52
and but nah I'm not going to blame Flat

2314.04 --> 2321.079
Earth for that I am beside

2317.52 --> 2323.0
my my verbal capabilities I am also just

2321.079 --> 2326.1600000000003
kind of a

2323.0 --> 2329.88
Hermit naturally I don't really like

2326.16 --> 2329.8799999999997
hanging around people a

2330.96 --> 2336.56
lot I like to have good one-on-one

2334.079 --> 2339.44
conversations but I don't like to hang

2336.56 --> 2339.44
around other people

2340.56 --> 2348.0789999999997
and it's been a very long time since I

2344.92 --> 2352.6800000000003
heard conversations between other

2348.079 --> 2352.6800000000003
people that wouldn't just start to bore

2355.52 --> 2362.56
me but yeah it's just I

2358.839 --> 2362.56
have high

2366.359 --> 2372.52
expectations mundane conversations just

2369.599 --> 2372.52
bore me a

2375.56 --> 2379.96
lot the only real

2378.119 --> 2382.88
Dutch

2379.96 --> 2386.44
elaborate Dutch that I've had is like

2382.88 --> 2386.44
with my conversations from my friend

2386.8 --> 2393.48
in you ever think of translating English

2389.72 --> 2395.9599999999996
to make money yeah I did I actually did

2393.48 --> 2398.04
a little project with that for a little

2395.96 --> 2400.4
bit but there was just lit

2398.04 --> 2403.56
zero zero

2400.4 --> 2407.52
response that was years ago it's just no

2403.56 --> 2408.59
response at all nothing not one

2407.52 --> 2409.8

2408.59 --> 2412.76
[Music]

2409.8 --> 2417.6400000000003
so whatever

2412.76 --> 2421.0
man yeah but uh don't you worry about

2417.64 --> 2424.56
how I make money

2421.0 --> 2427.56
yeah I don't need any suggestions

2424.56 --> 2430.72
whatsoever concerning that why what I

2427.56 --> 2435.44
need is a topic to talk

2430.72 --> 2436.5989999999997
about and that topic does not include me

2435.44 --> 2439.319
making

2436.599 --> 2443.04
money other than through donations that

2439.319 --> 2446.7599999999998
I get from followers of my Channel all

2443.04 --> 2446.7599999999998
right that's your last

2449.85 --> 2452.909
[Music]

2454.4 --> 2460.0
warning yeah

2456.24 --> 2460.0
whatever that's

2461.2 --> 2466.8799999999997
fine would I date a full on glob or

2464.0 --> 2466.88
woman

2466.96 --> 2473.0
no absolutely

2469.44 --> 2474.48
not cuz there's always other sides to

2473.0 --> 2479.119
that glober

2474.48 --> 2483.4
richness that I will not deal

2479.119 --> 2485.56
with like the globe religion never comes

2483.4 --> 2489.2400000000002
alone there's always other terrible

2485.56 --> 2489.24
things that come alongside it

2507.28 --> 2513.599
like what Global woman would like de

2511.16 --> 2519.24
like date me

2513.599 --> 2519.2400000000002
anyway A Healer glober no

2519.319 --> 2527.4
he's neutral he's very focused on his

2524.8 --> 2534.079
teachings and his lore rudol Steiner

2527.4 --> 2534.079
lore and that is it's neutral it's just

2534.24 --> 2541.0
neutral I did like confront him with it

2536.96 --> 2541.0
a couple of times and he found it very

2542.839 --> 2548.2799999999997
confusing cuz believe it or not in the

2546.2 --> 2550.68
spirit cosmology

2548.28 --> 2553.4
even of rudol Steiner and all the Healer

2550.68 --> 2557.7599999999998
stuff they do

2553.4 --> 2561.319
like in some of them call it

2557.76 --> 2563.7200000000003
planets like spiritually like not oh

2561.319 --> 2566.64
it's over there but it's just like in

2563.72 --> 2569.9199999999996
the spirit cosmology there are

2566.64 --> 2573.0
considered to be places that they would

2569.92 --> 2575.0
name planets and they even say that it

2573.0 --> 2578.079
is connected to the celestial lights but

2575.0 --> 2581.16
it is purely spiritual

2578.079 --> 2583.4
and it's kind of confusing like that so

2581.16 --> 2586.839
yeah my healer is not interested in that

2583.4 --> 2586.839
it's just not his

2588.88 --> 2597.119
CET but he has nothing against it

2593.88 --> 2599.559
though like nothing at all he's very

2597.119 --> 2602.76
neutral about it and he knows about just

2599.559 --> 2604.8390000000004
the sheer amount of devastating amount

2602.76 --> 2607.7200000000003
of misinformation that has been going

2604.839 --> 2609.99
around for centuries he is very well

2607.72 --> 2613.22
aware of

that Benjamin followers have a very

spiritual trait to

trying to pretend they're adults like

2828.0 --> 2836.52
stay is there somebody I can

2831.64 --> 2836.52
call because that would be quite insane

2840.839 --> 2848.599
duper like women don't do that

2845.28 --> 2850.96
ever especially to some guy like looks

2848.599 --> 2854.599

2913.24 --> 2920.839
yeah no but duper I mean the best you

2916.64 --> 2923.72
can expect is that somebody's

2920.839 --> 2926.24
like you're in the same store or

2923.72 --> 2928.68
something and then they might be like

2926.24 --> 2932.52
hey what are you looking for or whatever

2928.68 --> 2934.52
or like hi I've seen you here before

2932.52 --> 2936.88
like they might start a conversation and

2934.52 --> 2939.96
then eventually that might be like hey

2936.88 --> 2943.559
you doing something which is like would

2939.96 --> 2946.96
be pretty shocking to me but there's no

2943.559 --> 2949.96
woman out there ever that's just going

2946.96 --> 2952.88
to walk up to somebody in the street and

2949.96 --> 2956.2400000000002
ask them well can I be your girlfriend

2952.88 --> 2960.119
like that that's never

2956.24 --> 2962.4399999999996
happened except with girls that are like

2960.119 --> 2964.079
insane or on drugs or something like if

2962.44 --> 2966.96
they were

2964.079 --> 2968.7200000000003
on ecstasy or something they might do do

2966.96 --> 2970.76
that but that would be very apparent

2968.72 --> 2973.64
like uh they're on drugs or something

2970.76 --> 2975.44
and yeah it it doesn't happen they don't

2973.64 --> 2979.44
do that it doesn't work like that I know

2975.44 --> 2983.359
you're slightly autistic you admitted to

3450.799 --> 3455.119
quit because I shifted I don't even

3453.24 --> 3460.4399999999996
think it's like the

3455.119 --> 3462.119
shift happened because I quit I quit

3460.44 --> 3463.88
because the shift had happened and I

3462.119 --> 3467.0
just couldn't handle it anymore it

3463.88 --> 3468.2400000000002
didn't work the way it used to it didn't

3467.0 --> 3470.559
have

3468.24 --> 3473.0789999999997
the nice

3470.559 --> 3476.4
feelings it just induced panic attacks

3473.079 --> 3479.8390000000004
and that kind of thing all of a sudden

3476.4 --> 3483.64
even with minimum amounts so that's why

3479.839 --> 3487.2799999999997
I quit and which happens to also be very

3483.64 --> 3491.359
convenient considering the financial

3487.28 --> 3491.3590000000004
situation that I found myself

3500.24 --> 3506.68
in

3503.079 --> 3510.4
right but yeah whatever this is just the

3506.68 --> 3513.2
way it is I'm waking up earlier and hey

3510.4 --> 3516.88
sometimes I do actually need that time I

3513.2 --> 3520.0389999999998
do need that time to kind of wake up I'm

3516.88 --> 3524.4
just really I feel really lucky

3520.039 --> 3528.119
that I don't feel sickish in the

3524.4 --> 3531.4
morning dud I have had like some days

3528.119 --> 3536.52
where I wake up and I feel like just

3531.4 --> 3539.48
dread like this terrible feeling but

3536.52 --> 3542.359
I've had issues for a long

3539.48 --> 3547.119
time like as far as I can remember since

3542.359 --> 3551.319
my teens at least or if I woke up really

3547.119 --> 3555.2400000000002
early that I would just feel sick in my

3551.319 --> 3558.2
stomach a lot and that would last up

3555.24 --> 3560.7599999999998
until 12 or

3558.2 --> 3561.7599999999998
1:00 and I've had that even like in the

3560.76 --> 3564.079
last

3561.76 --> 3567.119
decade for some

3564.079 --> 3568.76
reason which is missed if Ying to me

3567.119 --> 3572.359
that seem to have

3568.76 --> 3572.3590000000004
disappeared so

3573.16 --> 3576.839
yeah all is what it

3578.119 --> 3584.88
is and in in a way like arguably that's

3581.799 --> 3586.88
good it's good because like being sick

3584.88 --> 3590.4
in the morning

3586.88 --> 3592.799
sucks it really does suck now I don't

3590.4 --> 3592.799
have that

3593.16 --> 3598.359
issue I couldn't even like technically

3596.039 --> 3601.7990000000004
eat some breakfast in the morning and

3598.359 --> 3601.799
that's does

3603.52 --> 3606.52
great

3609.319 --> 3615.92
so why are you asking why why are you

3612.24 --> 3618.2799999999997
just keeping asking like

3615.92 --> 3621.76
this why don't you just draw your own

3618.28 --> 3621.76
conclusion from everything I've

3624.96 --> 3627.96
said

3647.44 --> 3653.96
you can't just put it one onone you just

3650.039 --> 3657.88
can't got it what cannabis does to

3653.96 --> 3660.52
people differs from person to person

3657.88 --> 3664.2000000000003
from phase in their life to phase in

3660.52 --> 3666.0389999999998
their life there's not one universal

3664.2 --> 3668.319
system that you can just say oh it's

3666.039 --> 3670.3590000000004
always like this yeah it doesn't work

3668.319 --> 3674.599
like that so why don't you stop

3670.359 --> 3674.5989999999997
pestering me about it

3684.92 --> 3687.92
okay

3693.7 --> 3697.06
[Music]

3704.799 --> 3710.0
yeah there's plenty of people out there

3707.039 --> 3712.48
smoke weed all the time and you have

3710.0 --> 3714.839
none of these issues that I

3712.48 --> 3716.48
have

3714.839 --> 3718.88
none

3716.48 --> 3722.96
there's no Universal

3718.88 --> 3725.0
working it differs from person to person

3722.96 --> 3728.559
from phasing their life to phase in

3725.0 --> 3734.319
their life there's not one unified

3728.559 --> 3734.3190000000004
conclusion you can draw and that's

3734.88 --> 3741.48
that just have to figure it out for

3738.16 --> 3741.48
yourself or

3744.839 --> 3747.839
not

3750.16 --> 3752.52
that's

3754.52 --> 3759.0
right hey Ben Johnston good to see

around you

4033.72 --> 4040.48
see this is not

4036.76 --> 4043.88
the Hang place for people that don't

4040.48 --> 4045.52
have anything interesting in their lives

4043.88 --> 4048.96
this is a place where you come if you're

4045.52 --> 4050.359
you're curious if you have questions if

4048.96 --> 4053.079
you want to learn

4050.359 --> 4056.279
stuff that's what this channel is for

4053.079 --> 4058.0
not a hanging place for losers that have

4056.279 --> 4060.319
nothing else to do with their

4058.0 --> 4062.52
lives got

4060.319 --> 4065.88
it and if you have a problem with that

4062.52 --> 4065.88
I'll just kick you out I don't

4067.76 --> 4072.92
care yeah somebody's seen that I'm sure

4071.319 --> 4078.88
they did I've heard about it I haven't

4072.92 --> 4078.88
watched it I took note of it

4087.96 --> 4094.44
BL I mean in a way I was expecting

4092.279 --> 4097.56
something like that to happen at some

4094.44 --> 4101.92
point yeah I'm not the only one that is

4097.56 --> 4101.92
getting trolled here Nathan is as

4104.44 --> 4110.04
well and now he's kind of starting

4113.719 --> 4121.719
to pushing back right maybe because it's

4117.92 --> 4124.4400000000005
been going for months months and

4121.719 --> 4126.64
months and I'm always pushing back

4124.44 --> 4130.599999999999
against

4126.64 --> 4133.52
that and Nathan for some reason was

4130.6 --> 4135.88
recommended or whatever to like no no

4133.52 --> 4139.719
hold it off but I mean he must be

4135.88 --> 4142.64
feeling it like no no it's actually a

4139.719 --> 4143.56
slippery shitty slope that's just going

4142.64 --> 4146.159000000001
to get

4143.56 --> 4149.04
worse and he's getting dragged along

4146.159 --> 4152.0
with it as well and he doesn't want that

4149.04 --> 4156.359
but it's not just going to blow over and

4152.0 --> 4159.4
Nathan is taking notice of that so we'll

4156.359 --> 4161.59
see what else happens right there's

4159.4 --> 4163.799
other stuff too

4161.59 --> 4167.400000000001
[Music]

4163.799 --> 4170.319
happening people that have been nagging

4167.4 --> 4170.3189999999995
me in the

4170.6 --> 4179.04
background like there

4173.92 --> 4181.04
are revealing themselves and now turning

4179.04 --> 4183.159
against

4181.04 --> 4185.199
Nathan

4183.159 --> 4188.48
yeah I told

4185.199 --> 4190.759
them when I went back to

4188.48 --> 4194.32
apologize I told them they're they're

4190.759 --> 4196.0
just trying to divide us he didn't

4194.32 --> 4198.679
listen

4196.0 --> 4198.679
he's going to

4206.68 --> 4209.909000000001
[Music]

4222.239 --> 4228.48
listen internet drama yeah but this case

4225.08 --> 4229.44
in it's not just internet drama clutch

4228.48 --> 4232.44
it is

4229.44 --> 4232.44
the

4233.56 --> 4240.4800000000005
inevitable resolution it

4236.44 --> 4243.28
is fulfilling if you will this was going

4240.48 --> 4245.239
to happen it's just all happening a lot

4243.28 --> 4247.08
quicker than I anticipated I thought

4245.239 --> 4250.08
like this is probably going to go on for

4247.08 --> 4253.5199999999995
another half year but it seems that it's

4250.08 --> 4256.28
it's actually accelerating now and I

4253.52 --> 4261.6
don't have to do anything I'm just

4256.28 --> 4264.32
sitting back doing my show restoring a

4261.6 --> 4266.0
lot I'm restoring a lot I'm regenerating

4264.32 --> 4270.199
a

4266.0 --> 4273.44
lot I'm getting more

4270.199 --> 4276.44
clarity and in a way

4273.44 --> 4278.799999999999
clutch the reasons as to how that works

4276.44 --> 4282.28
is partly because of the

4278.8 --> 4283.92
video it's because of the Solitude the

4282.28 --> 4286.159
Solitude me

4283.92 --> 4289.56
retracting has

4286.159 --> 4290.96
really helped me to restore back to my

4289.56 --> 4293.679
full

4290.96 --> 4296.12
capacity I'm not even fully regenerated

4293.679 --> 4300.8
yet but I am already noticing I had a

4296.12 --> 4305.4
discussion yesterday also over Discord

4300.8 --> 4309.360000000001
about Quant mechanics and I explained it

4305.4 --> 4312.638999999999
in a way where I was astounded how well

4309.36 --> 4315.799999999999
I could actually explain it

4312.639 --> 4320.28
now like astounded like I never never

4315.8 --> 4320.28
expected I would have been that good at

4320.52 --> 4328.040000000001
it so my capacity is

4324.639 --> 4330.88
growing like

4328.04 --> 4333.88
substantially and it is because I have

4330.88 --> 4334.719
retracted it is because I've gone out of

4333.88 --> 4339.639
the

4334.719 --> 4344.159
hole where I was not directly by Nathan

4339.639 --> 4347.159000000001
but overall getting energy parasited

4344.159 --> 4347.159
upon

4352.12 --> 4359.2699999999995
[Music]

4360.4 --> 4363.719
no it's

4368.44 --> 4374.12
[Â __Â ] flat soid not a is not ace he's

4371.639 --> 4377.12
a troll baiting

4374.12 --> 4377.12
[Â __Â ]

4386.04 --> 4390.0
yeah Richard G get to

4390.48 --> 4396.08
you think Nathan wants to bring me back

4393.159 --> 4398.879999999999
after not yet

4396.08 --> 4401.5599999999995
duper there's more there's a lot more

4398.88 --> 4401.56
that needs to

4402.32 --> 4407.12
happen is going to have to figure it out

4404.8 --> 4407.12
because

4407.6 --> 4415.0
the problem is

4410.92 --> 4417.12
deep very deep and very

4415.0 --> 4419.48
widespread and he's going to have to

4417.12 --> 4420.48
figure it out all of it and he's going

4419.48 --> 4425.08
to have

4420.48 --> 4428.199
to take care of it and I'm not involved

4425.08 --> 4431.8
like I stepped out I stepped out for

4428.199 --> 4437.0
that to start happening I withdrew my

4431.8 --> 4439.0
blessing which really is a thing

4437.0 --> 4440.96
whether you believe in it or not it's

4439.0 --> 4443.719
palpable it's palpable to me it's

4440.96 --> 4448.28
palpable to them a lot is happened

4443.719 --> 4452.92
because of that including actual

4448.28 --> 4455.88
threats and now it has to resolve itself

4452.92 --> 4458.679
and it's up to Nathan whether how far

4455.88 --> 4458.679
he's going to take

4461.28 --> 4467.04
that he might find himself in a position

4464.56 --> 4467.04
where he's

4467.08 --> 4471.28
against all expectations of everybody

4469.28 --> 4473.12
out there even going to like retract

4471.28 --> 4476.4
himself from the internet you might not

4473.12 --> 4479.5599999999995
believe it but s it's the situation

4476.4 --> 4482.879999999999
overall is pretty damn serious I've been

4479.56 --> 4485.84
seeing it that it is pretty

4482.88 --> 4489.719
serious everybody else has just

4485.84 --> 4490.719
been underestimating it and it has to

4489.719 --> 4494.52
resolve

4490.719 --> 4496.8
itself it's like there's a sickness it

4494.52 --> 4499.2390000000005
has to be be fevered out and that fever

4496.8 --> 4500.04
is going to run up high and it's going

4499.239 --> 4502.44
to

4500.04 --> 4505.36
hurt and it's going to have to resolve

4502.44 --> 4508.799999999999
itself and then at some

4505.36 --> 4511.799999999999
point I hope it I really hope it

4508.8 --> 4514.8
cuz Nathan

4511.8 --> 4517.52
might get out of it and then we'll see

4514.8 --> 4520.56
and when he does he will know he will

4517.52 --> 4523.080000000001
regain certain senses that have been

4520.56 --> 4526.04
suppressed for a long long

4523.08 --> 4528.6
time they have they're

4526.04 --> 4531.679
subtle he's just been too busy and

4528.6 --> 4533.159000000001
occupied to even notice that or maybe he

4531.679 --> 4535.32
did notice it and he just didn't know

4533.159 --> 4539.08
what to do about it

4535.32 --> 4542.84
but the old Nathan May

4539.08 --> 4546.08
return but it's going to take a lot of

4542.84 --> 4550.0
effort and a lot of breaking through

4546.08 --> 4551.76
knots and like dedicated transformation

4550.0 --> 4553.92
and

4551.76 --> 4555.52
facing difficult

4553.92 --> 4558.159
situations

4555.52 --> 4562.159000000001
socially and

4558.159 --> 4562.159
so I'm just going to be

4563.88 --> 4568.12
here if Nathan comes back to me I will

4567.04 --> 4571.04
have

4568.12 --> 4573.76
demands and there will be no other way I

4571.04 --> 4578.239
will not return to

4573.76 --> 4578.2390000000005
him already done everything I

4581.28 --> 4588.12
could and until he's at the point where

4584.08 --> 4589.76
he realizes is that I have full right to

4588.12 --> 4592.28
make those

4589.76 --> 4594.2390000000005
demands there's no point you'll just

4592.28 --> 4596.92
have to sit through

4594.239 --> 4599.199
it and maybe he will never do it like

4596.92 --> 4600.8
maybe will stay apart maybe he will hold

4599.199 --> 4603.12
a grudge for everything that's happened

4600.8 --> 4605.159000000001
and then that's his prerogative I have

4603.12 --> 4609.159
no problem with

4605.159 --> 4610.638999999999
it I don't hate him I don't hate him for

4609.159 --> 4613.759999999999
everything that's

4610.639 --> 4615.96
happened I wish him well genuinely but

4613.76 --> 4619.04
he is in a tricky

4615.96 --> 4622.36
position and he will remain so until he

4619.04 --> 4622.36
works himself out of

4625.9 --> 4631.429999999999
[Music]

4635.26 --> 4640.360000000001
[Music]

4637.679 --> 4642.88
it hey what do you

4640.36 --> 4646.839999999999
mean you don't make demands on my

4642.88 --> 4646.84
Channel That's So gr and strength

4649.4 --> 4656.638999999999
right yeah know floid has no loyalties

4653.4 --> 4658.5599999999995
to the Flat Earth debates group and

4656.639 --> 4659.88
Nathan is starting to realize that that

4658.56 --> 4663.4400000000005
he

4659.88 --> 4666.12
is losing his virtual Authority he's

4663.44 --> 4667.44
losing his momentum he's faltering

4666.12 --> 4670.199
despite

4667.44 --> 4673.12
everything and now he's been facing

4670.199 --> 4676.96
himself with that and flatso's

4673.12 --> 4680.28
just using it because he flatso now

4676.96 --> 4681.88
thinks he's winning he's the troll King

4680.28 --> 4683.639
he wants to be the troll King there's a

4681.88 --> 4687.159000000001
troll rise

4683.639 --> 4689.36
everywhere giant piles of trolls right

4687.159 --> 4691.879999999999
fall of the wizard

4689.36 --> 4693.88
Council trolls come out of the Shadows I

4691.88 --> 4698.92
mean that title of my

4693.88 --> 4700.36
show was not just a random title it was

4698.92 --> 4703.88
a

4700.36 --> 4708.199
prediction was an esoteric prediction

4703.88 --> 4713.639
that is very very key to what is

4708.199 --> 4713.638999999999
happening was not some random set of

4715.44 --> 4723.96
words I remember that b of the wizard

4720.44 --> 4727.638999999999
Council barded this breaks out could

4723.96 --> 4729.44
have also said like the trolls break out

4727.639 --> 4731.04
it's not just ball tarded these trolls

4729.44 --> 4733.799999999999
are not

4731.04 --> 4736.84
bards they're anything and everything

4733.8 --> 4739.84
they're just nastiness nastiness on

4736.84 --> 4741.719
every level the nastiness in the Ballers

4739.84 --> 4744.4400000000005
and the nastiness in the flat earthers

4741.719 --> 4744.44
are coming

4745.719 --> 4751.76
together as I have tried to bring the

4749.199 --> 4755.5199999999995
good within Ballers and the good within

4751.76 --> 4755.52
flat earthers together on my

4757.199 --> 4764.159
channel nostr Arwin that's cute just

4761.76 --> 4765.320000000001
call me the Oracle that triggers the

4764.159 --> 4770.5599999999995
trolls a l

4765.32 --> 4771.96
lot and I don't care cuz I am and it's

4770.56 --> 4775.2390000000005
not

4771.96 --> 4777.159
unique but I do I just do that yeah and

4775.239 --> 4780.799999999999
there's plenty of people I made some

4777.159 --> 4783.04
very detailed predictions to in the

4780.8 --> 4789.08
background not

4783.04 --> 4793.6
public and they have viewed how I called

4789.08 --> 4795.5599999999995
things to incredible surreal detail and

4793.6 --> 4799.4400000000005
I will remain

4795.56 --> 4802.120000000001
so doing that cuz that is what I

4799.44 --> 4804.759999999999
do yeah that does trigger them I know it

4802.12 --> 4809.28
does a lot they can they can't stand it

4804.76 --> 4813.679
they hate it like it hurts them it hurts

4809.28 --> 4817.4
them that I say I'm I'm the Oracle or an

4813.679 --> 4818.4
oracle it hurts them they want me to say

4817.4 --> 4821.4
it's a

4818.4 --> 4823.839999999999
lie literally they want me to say that

4821.4 --> 4825.759999999999
it's a lie that I made it up I'm not

4823.84 --> 4827.92
going to

4825.76 --> 4830.6
I can predict

4827.92 --> 4832.84
things and there's nothing they can do

4830.6 --> 4832.84
about

4847.719 --> 4852.92
it two days ago he gave wrenches to

4850.639 --> 4857.2390000000005
everybody who showed up in his chat yeah

4852.92 --> 4860.52
duper because flat soid is now a troll

4882.4 --> 4886.5599999999995
prediction this screw you

4887.159 --> 4891.638999999999

don't make predictions that concern

4891.639 --> 4899.76
money or that you can parasite of yeah

4896.28 --> 4901.719
if I'd be able to do that I'd use it for

4899.76 --> 4904.1990000000005
me

4901.719 --> 4906.12
idiot think I'm just going to like oh

4906.12 --> 4912.32
just give it to you go [Â __Â ] yourself

4908.44 --> 4912.32
[Â __Â ] that's not how this

4913.12 --> 4919.04
works that's not not the frequency of

4915.96 --> 4922.0
the predictions that I make it's not the

4919.04 --> 4925.56
field of it you know I'm joking right

4922.0 --> 4925.56
yeah and it's a stupid lame

4925.8 --> 4933.719
joke just proves that you're not getting

4930.04 --> 4935.0
it your joke is not funny it's

4933.719 --> 4938.04
lame

4935.0 --> 4941.199
[Music]

4938.04 --> 4942.159
yeah you don't understand how predicting

4941.199 --> 4946.5199999999995
things

4942.159 --> 4946.5199999999995
work and your joke proves it

4951.159 --> 4955.719
do I bake really good cookies yeah

4952.96 --> 4955.719
that's a matrix

4955.84 --> 4959.88
reference no no I

4967.239 --> 4973.44
don't but I will be able to

4970.199 --> 4975.638999999999
tell somebody exactly what they need to

4973.44 --> 4977.08
hear

4975.639 --> 4980.719
in

4977.08 --> 4982.08
private I do do that part I don't bake

4980.719 --> 4985.28
cookies though I don't even have the

4982.08 --> 4988.92
oven to bake cookies I don't eat

4985.28 --> 4993.88
cookies I'm not really a cookie

4988.92 --> 4996.84
guy I am however an Illuminati cant guy

4993.88 --> 5001.2390000000005
and I definitely do put those in the

4996.84 --> 5001.2390000000005
oven and then eat them on my show

5003.44 --> 5006.44
Cheers

5008.8 --> 5011.939
[Music]

5027.12 --> 5031.36
a little bit of sun coming through

5029.04 --> 5031.36
that's

5033.44 --> 5036.44
nice

5047.41 --> 5050.639999999999
[Music]

5052.08 --> 5057.04
oh look who woke up

5054.04 --> 5057.04
there

5060.82 --> 5066.32
[Music]

5062.08 --> 5066.32
oh quick shooting there clutch

5085.03 --> 5088.099999999999
[Music]

5091.55 --> 5095.9800000000005
[Music]

5093.8 --> 5098.400000000001
h

5095.98 --> 5101.759999999999
[Music]

5098.4 --> 5104.759999999999
right but the funny funny thing about

5101.76 --> 5104.76
troll hards

5105.52 --> 5111.119000000001
is they

5107.32 --> 5113.46
always without a single

5111.119 --> 5116.0
exception end up eating their

5113.46 --> 5119.719
[Music]

5116.0 --> 5122.04
own and that's the real

5119.719 --> 5126.32
revenge that's the Revenge that you

5122.04 --> 5128.32
don't have to get involved with

5126.32 --> 5130.5199999999995
just like Satanist it's not that much of

5128.32 --> 5130.5199999999995
a

5133.4 --> 5140.159
difference satanists are always the ones

5136.04 --> 5140.159
that eventually end up getting

5143.04 --> 5147.36
sacrificed

5144.719 --> 5150.4800000000005
because Satan does not have mercy for

5147.36 --> 5150.48
his followers at

5153.239 --> 5159.599999999999
all

5155.88 --> 5162.0
now Satanism is literally pure evil

5159.6 --> 5165.0
trollish is

5162.0 --> 5165.0
pure

5168.88 --> 5174.36
chaos but it works the same in the

5175.119 --> 5182.32
end so anybody who putss at the top who

5179.52 --> 5187.6
tries the lead who tries to take the

5182.32 --> 5190.119
steering wheel they always fall it's

5187.6 --> 5193.0
unavoidable

5190.119 --> 5194.679
so whatever Flats soid think he's doing

5193.0 --> 5198.28
he's doing it to

5194.679 --> 5198.28
himself it can't

5200.76 --> 5206.56
last same goes for certain other

5203.92 --> 5210.0
individuals it can't

5206.56 --> 5213.0
last it's going to collapse in on

5210.0 --> 5213.0
themselves

5213.239 --> 5219.119
and

5215.56 --> 5219.119000000001
they have nobody to blame but

5225.92 --> 5233.52
themselves so I'm doing fine I'm good I

5229.96 --> 5236.08
was in a bit of a panic and paranoia in

5233.52 --> 5239.119000000001
the last month partially because I quit

5236.08 --> 5241.44
smoking partially because of just

5239.119 --> 5243.759999999999
triggered events triggered memory

5241.44 --> 5246.5199999999995
Amnesia suddenly being lifted and

5243.76 --> 5251.679
terrible memories coming back all

5246.52 --> 5255.52
that but since that happened I've grown

5251.679 --> 5258.32
so much stronger so much more confident

5255.52 --> 5262.0
that the moment where it started to hit

5258.32 --> 5262.0
and I lost my confidence in a

5262.6 --> 5268.84
way I've already and it's not even fully

5266.239 --> 5273.119
grown yet I've already gained more

5268.84 --> 5276.119000000001
confidence than I lost in that moment

5273.119 --> 5276.119
already

5277.76 --> 5281.96
I am stronger

5279.32 --> 5284.239
now and I know exactly where all of this

5281.96 --> 5284.2390000000005
is

5285.53 --> 5288.62
[Music]

5289.56 --> 5295.84
going and I

5292.04 --> 5299.36
know that unlike some other people I

5295.84 --> 5302.119000000001
will make it through I know I

5299.36 --> 5306.119
will it's no I have no more doubts about

5302.119 --> 5306.119
it I know I will

5327.679 --> 5333.2390000000005
is it that some have theories that

5330.48 --> 5335.799999999999
others don't no it's not about that Oro

5333.239 --> 5338.678999999999
it's not about the content it's purely

5335.8 --> 5342.76
about social behavior you know that

5338.679 --> 5346.4400000000005
thing that I've made like a prime issue

5342.76 --> 5346.4400000000005
on my channel for years

5347.88 --> 5353.679
now

5349.48 --> 5357.48
and others and their channels have not

5353.679 --> 5361.36
they didn't do that they did make the

5357.48 --> 5364.839999999999
arguments and claims of lying about them

5361.36 --> 5367.36
the prime factor in

5364.84 --> 5368.679
determining all these things like

5367.36 --> 5369.759999999999
whether you're part of the channel

5368.679 --> 5371.88
whether you're going to get banned or

5369.76 --> 5376.76
not and

5371.88 --> 5380.639
Etc I did it about the behavior and

5376.76 --> 5383.88
now the negligence to deal with that and

5380.639 --> 5386.08
the asymmetry in dealing with it is

5383.88 --> 5388.96
catching up with

5386.08 --> 5391.44
everybody everybody else that has

5388.96 --> 5393.84
basically not done

5391.44 --> 5397.599999999999
that it's all coming to a head there's

5393.84 --> 5400.159000000001
big Transformations happening out

5397.6 --> 5403.92
there like the landscape the social

5400.159 --> 5407.28
landscape is dramatically changing a lot

5403.92 --> 5410.32
of people are throwing off their cloaks

5407.28 --> 5411.8
and revealing who they really are who

5410.32 --> 5414.96
they have

5411.8 --> 5417.08
been because now they don't fear anymore

5414.96 --> 5419.44
that if they show themselves that

5417.08 --> 5422.5199999999995
they're going to be like excommunicated

5419.44 --> 5426.44
because the balance of power the balance

5422.52 --> 5429.88
of social power has shifted it is in

5426.44 --> 5432.839999999999
getting in flux and when the balance of

5429.88 --> 5436.4800000000005
social power goes in flux within a

5432.84 --> 5439.56
community of groups that's

5436.48 --> 5442.0
when people that hid in the darkness

5439.56 --> 5446.159000000001
throw off their cloaks and try to take

5442.0 --> 5448.639
the Reigns that's when troll Kings

5446.159 --> 5451.799999999999
emerge there have been troll Kings

5448.639 --> 5455.679
already attempts at it people taking

5451.8 --> 5456.76
their Reigns and and there's more of

5455.679 --> 5458.28
them

5456.76 --> 5461.679
now

5458.28 --> 5465.759999999999
but eventually the storm will

5461.679 --> 5471.6
settle and then the sun will come

5465.76 --> 5471.6
through and those trolls will turn to

5481.04 --> 5487.36
rock so there you go

5484.84 --> 5487.360000000001
there's my

5487.48 --> 5493.36
prediction it's very overgeneralized I

5493.62 --> 5498.36
[Music]

5495.92 --> 5501.4
know but it is what's happening and it

5498.36 --> 5501.4
will continue for a

5505.56 --> 5511.96
bit oh hello man

5508.679 --> 5515.28
goas can't hear me oh

5511.96 --> 5519.4800000000005
okay well you're missing out

5515.28 --> 5519.48
then I'm all esoteric

5520.48 --> 5527.119
today and I'm like

5523.88 --> 5527.119
loving the

5527.36 --> 5532.839999999999
multiple Lord of the Ring based

5530.679 --> 5536.6
esoteric

5532.84 --> 5538.8
comparisons I love it I'm seeing so much

5536.6 --> 5538.8
of

5542.84 --> 5545.84
it

5545.96 --> 5548.639
the last month where I had panic attacks

5547.92 --> 5552.2390000000005
and

5548.639 --> 5556.719
everything it really genuinely feels

5552.239 --> 5559.199
like I was Gandalf the Gray I got

5556.719 --> 5561.4800000000005
drugged down by a bell rock falling into

5559.199 --> 5564.96
the depths of the mount

5561.48 --> 5568.718999999999
Moria and I

5564.96 --> 5571.32
died I didn't even recognize myself but

5568.719 --> 5575.84
I feel reborn stronger than before I

5571.32 --> 5575.84
feel like I've become Gand of the white

5575.92 --> 5582.52

[Â __Â ]

5584.04 --> 5588.88
it's

5585.76 --> 5594.08
symbolic it's exactly what it feel felt

5588.88 --> 5598.32
like I mean that month of panics was one

5594.08 --> 5601.96
of the most terrible times that I've

5598.32 --> 5601.96
had arguably

5602.76 --> 5607.159000000001
ever

5604.719 --> 5609.44
and even when it was happening I held

5607.159 --> 5611.119
most of it back from you guys because

5609.44 --> 5614.969999999999
it's like you don't share that type of

5611.119 --> 5618.039
vulnerability really in public it's

5614.97 --> 5618.039000000001
[Music]

5620.8 --> 5626.76
dangerous they were treating you badly

5623.52 --> 5630.360000000001
for too long in that yeah I know Arena

5626.76 --> 5633.2390000000005
kumble and it's true that I technically

5630.36 --> 5635.719
don't really care what you think but I

5633.239 --> 5635.718999999999
agree

5637.76 --> 5643.2390000000005
me leaving there like I did was not out

5641.04 --> 5643.239
of

5643.92 --> 5648.76
nowhere it's because of what has been

5646.8 --> 5653.400000000001
going on and as you

5648.76 --> 5656.2390000000005
said how they used me in a

5653.4 --> 5658.28
way and it transitioned from use to

5656.239 --> 5662.718999999999
abuse

5658.28 --> 5665.719
and I couldn't continue that I had to

5662.719 --> 5665.719
retract

5666.4 --> 5672.4
I had

5667.88 --> 5674.400000000001
to the b rock was going after our group

5672.4 --> 5677.679
and we were all going to

5674.4 --> 5680.199
perish and while the rest then moved

5677.679 --> 5682.119
on they had to move on without me and I

5680.199 --> 5684.239
had to face the bell rock and I did and

5682.119 --> 5685.96
it was

5684.239 --> 5691.44
terrifying in

5685.96 --> 5694.719
ways and in a way I died and

5691.44 --> 5696.119
transformed and I'm back I haven't met

5694.719 --> 5700.08
up with the group

5696.119 --> 5700.08
yet but

5701.0 --> 5710.639
soon I will at some point I predict I

5706.88 --> 5710.639
will face King

5711.52 --> 5714.779
[Music]

5715.119 --> 5719.48
Alon and lift him from the curse that he

5718.08 --> 5722.639
has been

5719.48 --> 5725.638999999999
under you can take a guess who that

5722.639 --> 5725.639
is

5728.679 --> 5733.159
yeah who was a king who's been

5730.88 --> 5736.119
irresponsible to their own

5733.159 --> 5737.879999999999
people banished their

5736.119 --> 5740.639
own

5737.88 --> 5743.28
negligent who is that metaphorically you

5740.639 --> 5743.28
you can take a

5744.52 --> 5747.52
guess

5750.52 --> 5755.4400000000005
right all right anyway maybe not it do

5753.679 --> 5758.1990000000005
doesn't

5755.44 --> 5760.719
matter you don't need to

5758.199 --> 5764.0
guess there's a lot of things happening

5760.719 --> 5766.08
and they will at some point happen and

5764.0 --> 5768.84
hey maybe in this story King Alon will

5766.08 --> 5768.84
literally just

5771.6 --> 5777.4400000000005
die and then the riim will have to do

5775.08 --> 5777.44
without

5777.639 --> 5786.84
him and leave it to his

5941.599 --> 5949.719

Nathan might not be doing a live

one immediately right after it was so

6010.56 --> 6014.0
tasty so

6019.56 --> 6024.639
great all right anyway any everybody

6022.32 --> 6027.5199999999995
here everybody still here please don't

6024.639 --> 6031.0
forget to rogans up the

6038.28 --> 6044.119
great don't know why it says zero that

6041.36 --> 6044.119
makes no damn

have

have done that and that

because I didn't unban

6230.639 --> 6237.08
you so I take it there was a reason that

6233.84 --> 6242.88
you had the troll reveal themselves in

6237.08 --> 6246.599
order to do that so what do you want to

6242.88 --> 6246.599
say better I make it

6251.679 --> 6255.4
good yes Dell was

6262.04 --> 6265.04
banned

6268.119 --> 6273.799999999999
you don't know anything about my

6270.32 --> 6273.799999999999

6274.239 --> 6282.48
don't what is it then do do you just

6277.32 --> 6286.239
come showing up am I still invisible and

6282.48 --> 6286.239
you just keep saying that every

6308.239 --> 6314.44

6331.4 --> 6336.159

6342.04 --> 6346.48

couple of

people

6378.56 --> 6386.76
yeah no I'm not going to investigate any

6382.679 --> 6390.28
re [Â __Â ] claims that are logically INF

6386.76 --> 6392.679
falsifiable d I addressed it like a year

6390.28 --> 6394.599
ago you ignored it you've been obsessed

6392.679 --> 6396.52
with this stupid claim that you make

6394.599 --> 6398.719
ever since and I'm not here to entertain

6396.52 --> 6398.719
your

6399.56 --> 6405.8
idiocy there's no hatred except what you

6402.52 --> 6405.8
have with your stupid

6411.84 --> 6414.84
obsessions

6424.92 --> 6430.4400000000005
homor physical acceleration it's

6427.52 --> 6433.080000000001
relative density and relative density is

6430.44 --> 6435.5199999999995
the only thing that is real it's

6433.08 --> 6440.08
Universal it's up and

6435.52 --> 6440.080000000001
down and there's no other

6441.84 --> 6444.84
discussion

6445.52 --> 6449.92
I'm not ignorant to anything I don't

6447.28 --> 6451.88
make any claims you're shoving words in

6449.92 --> 6454.719
people's mouths as you do continually

6451.88 --> 6457.679
it's the only thing you do anymore I

6454.719 --> 6457.679
don't want to be part of

6460.84 --> 6465.56
that your claims are INF falsifiable

6463.88 --> 6467.0
they're based on presuppositions that

6465.56 --> 6469.52
can never be

6467.0 --> 6471.639
proven uh I'm not going to waste my time

6469.52 --> 6473.639
in bickering with you about it and

6471.639 --> 6476.04
whatever you think how people should

6473.639 --> 6478.599
look at that entire situation that

6476.04 --> 6482.08
literally cannot be falsified so it's

6478.599 --> 6486.639
your problem you stick it to your

6482.08 --> 6486.639
channel and now you can [Â __Â ] off

6501.76 --> 6504.76
bye

6514.0 --> 6519.8
is my chat stuck for a

6516.599 --> 6519.8
while oh

6524.719 --> 6529.4
well so there's nothing to say about it

6527.4 --> 6531.719
it's a [Â __Â ] waste of time I don't

6529.4 --> 6535.36
care about how he's going to presuppose

6531.719 --> 6538.4
anything accelerating downward is

6535.36 --> 6542.44
nonsense it's no claim that I have I do

6538.4 --> 6545.119
want relative density and it's a force

6542.44 --> 6546.0
this equilibrium up and down depending

6545.119 --> 6549.32
on the

6546.0 --> 6552.119
ratio and I don't care about any other

6549.32 --> 6552.119
considerations

6553.159 --> 6559.08
whatsoever it's a total waste of

6560.84 --> 6565.639
time but I'm sure is going to make more

6563.76 --> 6567.4400000000005
stupid videos doing the same thing over

6565.639 --> 6570.52
and over again as he's been doing for

6567.44 --> 6573.96
over a year I'm very surprised he's

6570.52 --> 6577.280000000001
still can keep it up because it's so

6573.96 --> 6577.28
tediously boring

6579.04 --> 6584.56
now

6581.4 --> 6587.839999999999
yeah keep sticking keep sticking to your

6584.56 --> 6589.679
stupid upward movement [Â __Â ] claims

6587.84 --> 6592.4400000000005
that you can't falsify

6589.679 --> 6595.119
and I don't care I'm not going to waste

6592.44 --> 6595.119
my time with

6595.44 --> 6601.759999999999
that I'm definitely not going to sit

6598.599 --> 6606.56
through [Â __Â ] Li about you know that

6601.76 --> 6606.56

6609.119 --> 6615.639

6612.8 --> 6618.04
than having to endure that garbage get

6615.639 --> 6618.04

out

6628.66 --> 6631.79
[Music]

6634.199 --> 6639.0
R seems like something that can be coded

6636.719 --> 6643.44
in video game with density variables and

6639.0 --> 6646.32
if St yes it technically could although

6643.44 --> 6649.4
then instead of having polygons you'd

6646.32 --> 6649.4
have to actually

6650.32 --> 6659.32
have 3D sub substances with

6655.159 --> 6661.638999999999
density programming and that is

6659.32 --> 6664.639
difficult I mean you could have like a

6661.639 --> 6668.119
rendering system that uses that duper

6664.639 --> 6670.599
but it would be way more heavy

6668.119 --> 6673.598999999999
on on the actual

6670.599 --> 6675.76
rendering because there's like a lot

6673.599 --> 6678.0
many more factors than

6675.76 --> 6681.159000000001
just

6678.0 --> 6683.56
polygons just triangles that have to be

6681.159 --> 6687.48
calculated how they're going to reflect

6683.56 --> 6690.679
things so it's way heavier but yes you

6687.48 --> 6693.759999999999
can very much simulate a physics

6690.679 --> 6696.0
engine that simulates relative density

6693.76 --> 6696.0
quite

6711.52 --> 6716.159000000001
accurately

6713.239 --> 6718.638999999999
and the direction of density

6716.159 --> 6722.119
influence yeah well that's very simple

6718.639 --> 6726.079
less dense go up more dense go down

6722.119 --> 6730.96
done it's a very simple

6726.079 --> 6730.96
zaxis Spectrum I mean very

6735.079 --> 6740.32
simple yeah there's no relativity

6739.04 --> 6743.96
involved at

6740.32 --> 6748.5199999999995
all the direction is not

6743.96 --> 6751.36
relative the relative is a reference to

6748.52 --> 6754.679
the ratio the

6751.36 --> 6756.839999999999
relation of density of object with

6754.679 --> 6758.599
density of medium that's what the

6756.84 --> 6761.88
relative stands

6758.599 --> 6767.96
for and it is quite

6761.88 --> 6767.96
pronouncedly up and down over the z-axis

6769.48 --> 6775.159
universally you have chosen a direction

6771.92 --> 6779.599
yeah well just is that way nothing to

6775.159 --> 6779.598999999999
really choose from it's just like

6780.36 --> 6786.199
that yeah I I didn't set the parameters

much more

6829.639 --> 6836.36

what yeah there

6852.679 --> 6861.36
is there's no up and down in

6856.44 --> 6864.36
heliocentric outer space which doesn't

6861.36 --> 6864.36
exist

6868.0 --> 6874.88
in the real world there is no outer

6870.76 --> 6877.079000000001
space and there is an up and a down that

6874.88 --> 6877.079
is

6880.88 --> 6884.719
universal Cardinal if you

6891.32 --> 6894.32
will

6913.639 --> 6919.92
can't believe Dell actually uttered I

6916.36 --> 6923.079
will just [Â __Â ] lie about you now [Â __Â ]

6919.92 --> 6927.52
you wow so you're just going to tell me

6923.079 --> 6930.92
you going to lie about me what a [Â __Â ]

6927.52 --> 6935.159000000001
[Â __Â ] you're now a self admitted liar I

6930.92 --> 6939.36
mean what kind of a idiot would even do

6935.159 --> 6942.719
that g take a screenshot about that

6939.36 --> 6942.719
is quite

6947.719 --> 6954.2390000000005
idiotic needs to be on

6951.239 --> 6954.239
record

6956.48 --> 6962.638999999999
there a formula for relative density

6959.079 --> 6962.639
maybe I don't really

6966.32 --> 6972.0
care I can describe it you'll have to do

6969.76 --> 6972.0
with

6981.239 --> 6984.239
that

7011.239 --> 7014.239
for

7027.76 --> 7030.909000000001
[Music]

7041.159 --> 7044.159
for

7047.8 --> 7054.4800000000005
[Â __Â ]

7050.159 --> 7054.48
sake that's not where I wanted

7056.239 --> 7059.759999999999
that there you

7064.44 --> 7071.119
go I just show it on screen for the

7068.079 --> 7075.96
record it kind of got hidden and all

7071.119 --> 7077.96
that but uh yeah this is pretty funny

7075.96 --> 7080.88
you

7077.96 --> 7082.52
know what kind of [Â __Â ] will openly

7080.88 --> 7085.88
tell you that he's going to lie about

7082.52 --> 7089.4400000000005
you what kind of a [Â __Â ] are

7085.88 --> 7089.4400000000005
you that's just

7091.0 --> 7094.52
ridiculous yeah so

7100.56 --> 7106.56
again take a good look

7103.199 --> 7106.5599999999995
look this is

7115.44 --> 7121.4
Dell yeah Dell is

7118.56 --> 7124.599
Ban I'm

7121.4 --> 7126.92
sorry but after that like who wouldn't

7124.599 --> 7126.92
ban

7131.04 --> 7134.04
him

7140.239 --> 7143.4
so did you all get

7153.76 --> 7161.04
that D the self admitted liar

7158.88 --> 7164.04
congratulations

7161.04 --> 7164.04
d

7174.88 --> 7189.7300000000005
[Music]

7191.04 --> 7194.04
a

7194.679 --> 7199.04
right anyway back to the

7199.28 --> 7206.759999999999
show or maybe the next group of trolls

7202.679 --> 7209.1990000000005
is going to show up it does agree no

7206.76 --> 7211.360000000001
because I don't want to waste my time on

7209.199 --> 7214.28
people that literally tell you they're

7211.36 --> 7214.28
going to lie about

7220.96 --> 7228.119
you

7223.32 --> 7231.239
wrong maybe but he's funny I'm no no

7228.119 --> 7231.239
he's just Sour

7234.04 --> 7240.079
Puss I don't know how he's funny at all

7237.8 --> 7242.639
it's just

7240.079 --> 7245.92
gross turning on for today yeah don't

7242.639 --> 7245.92
forget to Rogan it up

7250.92 --> 7253.92
guys

7270.44 --> 7273.799999999999
yeah duper I

7280.92 --> 7283.92
know

7310.84 --> 7315.8
for hey Ben Johnson are you still

7321.599 --> 7325.360000000001
here 34

7331.119 --> 7337.28
watching wouldn't argue with him face to

7334.28 --> 7337.28
face

7337.639 --> 7342.639
dude I wouldn't why would I go near that

7340.52 --> 7345.639
guy at this point he's just the

7342.639 --> 7345.639
hysterical

7349.48 --> 7355.598999999999
[Â __Â ] like he needs to stay away from

7352.199 --> 7355.598999999999
him or get a restraining

7370.84 --> 7373.84
order

7393.44 --> 7400.119
what was he like I don't

7396.4 --> 7402.839999999999
know he just said he was going to lie

7400.119 --> 7404.119
about me

7402.84 --> 7406.159000000001
I don't know what the hell he's going to

7404.119 --> 7407.598999999999
lie about me about but I mean what's the

7406.159 --> 7410.5599999999995
freaking

7407.599 --> 7412.360000000001
point like I don't care it's like oh

7410.56 --> 7415.719
he's going to lie about me oh well

7412.36 --> 7417.48
that's going to change everything then

7415.719 --> 7420.719
what

7417.48 --> 7420.718999999999
uh I'm

7422.0 --> 7427.679
sorry it's ridiculous and I don't want

7424.8 --> 7430.84
to have this whiny discussion with

7427.679 --> 7432.559
him about his stupid presupposing that

7430.84 --> 7434.4800000000005
the Earth is moving upward I I just

7432.559 --> 7437.320000000001
don't want to do it it's a waste of my

7434.48 --> 7437.32
time it's

7443.52 --> 7448.88
boring it's

7446.079 --> 7452.119
unfalsifiable can only be

7448.88 --> 7455.559
presupposed and it's pointless it's

7452.119 --> 7458.44
totally and utterly

7455.559 --> 7460.719
pointless okay bye debatable D hope you

7458.44 --> 7463.719
take care of your

7460.719 --> 7463.719
headache

7491.159 --> 7498.36
how good Earth even move upward I don't

7494.639 --> 7498.36
care to even argue

7499.559 --> 7505.88
that it could only move if there is a

7502.8 --> 7508.599
separate reference frame in which the

7505.88 --> 7511.159000000001
Earth as a realm enclosed would be

7508.599 --> 7513.88
existing and it's all quite the stretch

7511.159 --> 7516.679
and also like what would it then make up

7513.88 --> 7519.2390000000005
make it move upward right so it just

7516.679 --> 7522.36
makes everything

7519.239 --> 7524.44
worse it makes the whole

7522.36 --> 7525.36
conception of how the Earth would be

7524.44 --> 7527.879999999999
more

7525.36 --> 7529.96
convoluted more and more and more

7527.88 --> 7531.599
convoluted and there's no point to it

7529.96 --> 7533.559
you can't falsify it the only way you

7531.599 --> 7538.0
could

7533.559 --> 7539.8
ever come to theoretically prove that

7538.0 --> 7542.84
the Earth would be moving upward is if

7539.8 --> 7545.84
if you could somehow detach yourself

7542.84 --> 7545.84
from the reference

7545.88 --> 7554.92
frame and that can't happen

7550.4 --> 7558.239
obviously so so it's pointless it's a

7554.92 --> 7560.84
conception it's a conception that's that

7558.239 --> 7564.919999999999
I've heard before many times like

7560.84 --> 7567.8
decades ago the idea that an upward

7564.92 --> 7570.76
acceleration not movement acceleration

7567.8 --> 7573.92
would be the cause of basically relative

7570.76 --> 7577.04
density division density and

7573.92 --> 7580.8
buoyancy but it's presupposed you can't

7577.04 --> 7582.8
falsify it and letting something go in

7580.8 --> 7586.0
freefa doesn't

7582.8 --> 7586.0
prove the

7586.32 --> 7589.719
presupposition it just

7590.52 --> 7595.400000000001
doesn't only a Detachment from the

7593.079 --> 7597.759999999999
reference frame a separation of the

7595.4 --> 7600.759999999999
earth realm would come to prove it and

7597.76 --> 7602.360000000001
then yeah then what then you're gone and

7600.76 --> 7604.84
you can detach yourself if you could

7602.36 --> 7607.48
detach yourself that would mean that the

7604.84 --> 7609.32
containment of the realm would be open

7607.48 --> 7611.28
and then we couldn't have gas pressure

7609.32 --> 7616.4
so you can't detach yourself from the

7611.28 --> 7620.199
ref frame the whole premise is utterly

7616.4 --> 7622.879999999999
INF falsifiable it's pointless to

7620.199 --> 7625.96
consider it's another thought experiment

7622.88 --> 7629.719
it falls it's very close to the whole

7625.96 --> 7629.719
einsteinian relativity

7629.76 --> 7635.8
idea

7631.48 --> 7635.799999999999
unprovable a mathematical

7637.48 --> 7640.5199999999995
consideration I thought it was station

7639.32 --> 7642.119
yeah it is

7640.52 --> 7644.4400000000005
stationary

7642.119 --> 7644.44
that's

7645.52 --> 7651.320000000001
right and stationary isn't a claim

7649.559 --> 7654.559
there's nothing

7651.32 --> 7656.558999999999
happening there was a motion then you're

7654.559 --> 7658.52
having a claim of something happening

7656.559 --> 7661.119000000001
and that's just what it is and if you

7658.52 --> 7663.159000000001
don't want to recognize it then that's

7661.119 --> 7666.44
your

7663.159 --> 7666.44
problem not

7666.559 --> 7672.119000000001
mine and it obviously is Dell's problem

7669.76 --> 7674.559
he's been bickering about this one

7672.119 --> 7676.96
stupid little subject for over a year

7674.559 --> 7676.96
now

7677.04 --> 7683.199
and what shap does they he well he's

7680.32 --> 7683.199
technically a flat

7685.36 --> 7693.0
earther and he's now basically an upward

7688.8 --> 7693.0
moving flat earther

7697.8 --> 7703.4400000000005
specifically and he's just whining and

7700.4 --> 7703.44
attacking about it

7710.559 --> 7715.320000000001
Dell science is hilarious it's lame and

7713.559 --> 7717.04
doesn't abide by the scientific method

7715.32 --> 7719.96
the Dell

7717.04 --> 7722.0
is does not have a lot of grip on

7719.96 --> 7724.92
physics and the scientific

7722.0 --> 7728.719
method he almost did and then he all

7724.92 --> 7733.4400000000005
abandoned it just to go pursue his

7728.719 --> 7733.44
stupid upward motion idea

7734.48 --> 7739.839999999999
and you can like literally compare the

7736.4 --> 7742.28
quality of his talks now to let's say

7739.84 --> 7744.28
that of three years ago three years ago

7742.28 --> 7746.44
he was having pretty interesting

7744.28 --> 7751.96
realizations and explanations and now

7746.44 --> 7751.96
he's just a raving idiot

7758.119 --> 7765.839999999999
again you don't get what he's on about

7761.559 --> 7768.1990000000005
he wants to just be that guy he thinks

7765.84 --> 7770.4400000000005
that he has it right and he refuses to

7768.199 --> 7773.879999999999
submit that he's

7770.44 --> 7776.719
wrong that's it that's all there is for

7773.88 --> 7779.04
some people that's enough in their

7776.719 --> 7781.079
lives they think they got something

7779.04 --> 7785.0
unique and then they hold on to it

7781.079 --> 7788.84
forever even if it destroys

7785.0 --> 7790.32
everything I'm not I can't be bothered

7788.84 --> 7794.4800000000005
with

7790.32 --> 7797.4
it I'm definitely not going to spend

7794.48 --> 7798.5199999999995
like a lot of time bickering with him

7797.4 --> 7801.199
about

7798.52 --> 7803.360000000001
it especially after he declares he's

7801.199 --> 7804.199
going to lie about me now I mean what a

7803.36 --> 7807.639
[Â __Â ]

7804.199 --> 7810.48
idiot who the hell says that public

7807.639 --> 7810.4800000000005

hey Ken

7983.199 --> 7987.159
langy heard from you in a

7987.32 --> 7992.639
while would I want to know if Earth was

7989.76 --> 7992.639
in motion yeah it

8000.119 --> 8003.119
isn't

8016.159 --> 8020.199
if if there was something going on would

8019.04 --> 8023.199
I want

8020.199 --> 8023.199
to

8023.239 --> 8028.879999999999
uh yeah but it isn't though and we're

8026.719 --> 8032.04
definitely not going to make a claim it

8028.88 --> 8035.28
is langoy

8032.04 --> 8037.559
so yeah I'm not going to discuss

8035.28 --> 8040.759999999999
it Earth is

8037.559 --> 8043.76
stationary stationary isn't a claim

8040.76 --> 8043.76
that's where I'm going to leave

8050.639 --> 8055.4400000000005
it he was in chat yes Richard

8060.04 --> 8063.04
G

8068.04 --> 8074.44
seven to 10 deer daily

8071.44 --> 8074.44
what

8074.639 --> 8080.88
okay dang you missed it it didn't last

8077.88 --> 8081.84
very long it just suddenly came showing

8080.88 --> 8084.76
up

8081.84 --> 8086.559
and altogether it literally lasted 5

8084.76 --> 8089.320000000001
minutes before I had to kick him out

8086.559 --> 8093.04
because he was just ranting and whining

8089.32 --> 8093.04
about the usual

8095.4 --> 8105.598999999999
and he ended up telling me okay Arwin I

8100.079 --> 8110.04
will just [Â __Â ] lie about you now [Â __Â ]

8105.599 --> 8110.04
you I mean

8111.559 --> 8115.679
what like what's wrong with

8119.96 --> 8122.96
you

8124.44 --> 8130.678999999999
but I mean thanks for the

8127.199 --> 8130.678999999999
admission and all

8134.48 --> 8141.919999999999
that but I mean Richard G this world man

8138.84 --> 8144.360000000001
they're all going nuts all these flat

8141.92 --> 8148.639
earthers supposed flat earthers they're

8144.36 --> 8148.639
all going crazy man they go

8149.92 --> 8154.4800000000005
crazy I feel like I'm one of the few

8152.679 --> 8156.599
people that isn't actually going crazy

8154.48 --> 8161.119
I'm going through crazy things I'm going

8156.599 --> 8164.52
through painful things

8161.119 --> 8167.639
but I'm coming out of it better and

8164.52 --> 8170.88
stronger more clear

8167.639 --> 8170.88
minded than

8170.92 --> 8176.4
ever can't say the same thing for all of

8173.84 --> 8176.400000000001
these other

8177.76 --> 8181.599
people if we were moving upward we'd all

8180.719 --> 8182.559
be

8181.599 --> 8185.88
or

8182.559 --> 8190.4400000000005
whatever if we were ay if we

8185.88 --> 8193.8
were all Lego people then yeah

8190.44 --> 8195.029999999999
everything would be quite plastic I mean

8193.8 --> 8198.169
but we're not

8195.03 --> 8198.169
[Music]

8209.84 --> 8212.84
though

8239.84 --> 8242.84
e

8249.559 --> 8254.339
[Music]

8263.28 --> 8269.84
by the way seeing start like you're

8267.2 --> 8273.92
living on an airst

8269.84 --> 8278.0
strip so you're like you have an an

8273.92 --> 8281.559
airport right right where you live do

8278.0 --> 8283.88
actual planes take off and land there

8281.559 --> 8288.039999999999
sometimes this is a new one I didn't

8283.88 --> 8288.039999999999
know that you were like right at an

8294.479 --> 8300.559
airport do like private planes ever come

8297.439 --> 8302.08
to visit or like Drop resources or

8300.559 --> 8307.599
something

8302.08 --> 8307.599
something or do those get delivered with

8329.719 --> 8332.719
trucks

8338.08 --> 8342.439
anyway everybody that's here please

8340.28 --> 8344.2
don't forget to Rogan it up I mean it's

8342.439 --> 8347.519
a seems a little

8344.2 --> 8352.0
short on rogans is too bad I mean it's

8347.519 --> 8352.0
been a fun show but weird and

8359.719 --> 8362.719
chaotic

8362.84 --> 8368.639000000001
all the

8364.04 --> 8371.04
people are just in the

8368.639 --> 8373.24
chat I think it's kind of rude that you

8371.04 --> 8377.160000000002
hang around there yet you want rogans to

8373.24 --> 8377.16
show up like that's

8389.64 --> 8392.64
rude

8398.88 --> 8402.47

8480.08 --> 8484.8
three like I'm a glober but I hit that

8482.359 --> 8487.6
com yeah stepen J of course like why

8484.8 --> 8489.92
would you not do that just because

8487.6 --> 8489.92
you're a

8492.8 --> 8500.949999999999
glober I mean I expect plenty of people

8496.439 --> 8504.319
here that are globers to still like my

8500.95 --> 8504.319000000001
[Music]

8504.52 --> 8509.68
show what is the best evidence that has

8507.08 --> 8512.72
been presented to support Earth motion

8509.68 --> 8514.12
D's ball yeah he's just appealing to

8512.72 --> 8517.56
theory of

8514.12 --> 8520.68
relativity that's all he was doing

8517.56 --> 8524.0
like fed team like call it out like

8520.68 --> 8525.0
within a day of him starting to do that

8524.0 --> 8529.84
a

8525.0 --> 8532.56
day but he's still after like a year

8529.84 --> 8535.2
still rambling on about the same thing

8532.56 --> 8537.56
over and over again same thing over and

8535.2 --> 8540.6
over again every stream has appeared

8537.56 --> 8543.519999999999
there's only one subject he's been

8540.6 --> 8546.960000000001
talking about for a year every single

8543.52 --> 8549.24
stream he popped up this is stupid

8546.96 --> 8552.319
upward Rising earth oh bottle drop

8549.24 --> 8556.16
proves it blah blah blah it's the same

8552.319 --> 8556.16
[Â __Â ] over and over again it's very

8558.56 --> 8564.0
tedious Dell's flat smacking on the

8560.92 --> 8565.84
street yeah he's but he's just not doing

8564.0 --> 8569.439
it anyway he doesn't want to do that

8565.84 --> 8571.6
anymore he hates all the other flat

8569.439 --> 8575.6
earthers

8571.6 --> 8578.56
he does he hates them all so he doesn't

8575.6 --> 8580.439
do that anymore he thinks now that it's

8578.56 --> 8584.56
better to just like make it all

8580.439 --> 8584.56
disappear or something try to tear it

8594.0 --> 8598.88
down you only know this version of the

8599.439 --> 8607.880000000001
yeah but I mean richardy a lot of people

8604.24 --> 8609.68
like around 2015 to 17 there was a lot

8607.88 --> 8611.92
of good

8609.68 --> 8615.279
energy

8611.92 --> 8617.8
but yeah a lot of it has kind of like s

8615.279 --> 8617.800000000001
seeped

8620.12 --> 8626.399000000001
away and

8622.6 --> 8629.439
hey provably the world's become kind of

8626.399 --> 8633.278999999999
grim on all of

8629.439 --> 8636.800000000001
us so that probably has contributed to

8633.279 --> 8639.319000000001
the souring of the overall

8636.8 --> 8644.08
scene it certainly contributed to my

8639.319 --> 8644.08
rage win outbursts

8647.2 --> 8653.04
right d many demonstrations yeah he

8650.88 --> 8654.039999999999
threw many bottles out of the window

8653.04 --> 8656.720000000001
that's

8654.04 --> 8659.76
cool but I mean there's no point to it

8656.72 --> 8661.679999999998
though it's all just relativity it's

8659.76 --> 8663.12
completely pointless Ken langy it

8661.68 --> 8665.960000000001
doesn't prove

8663.12 --> 8667.12
anything only thing it proves is that if

8665.96 --> 8671.679999999998
you

8667.12 --> 8675.08
presuppose the scenario from a different

8671.68 --> 8677.359
perspective then you can make that claim

8675.08 --> 8680.359
that you can't prove because you're only

8677.359 --> 8683.399000000001
presupposing it and that's it that

8680.359 --> 8685.24
literally summarizes the entire ordeal

8683.399 --> 8686.56
that Dell's been harping on about for

8685.24 --> 8689.319
over a year

8686.56 --> 8691.76
now that is all it

8689.319 --> 8693.92
is

8691.76 --> 8698.399
I don't know why other people get caught

8693.92 --> 8701.6
up with it like you it's it's kind of

8698.399 --> 8704.599999999999
pitiful I mean aren't there more

8701.6 --> 8707.6
interesting things to to dig into than

8704.6 --> 8707.6
that

8709.6 --> 8716.08
can how can you not just be bored out of

8713.279 --> 8718.800000000001
your mind with that stupid

8716.08 --> 8721.24
subject over and over again there's

8718.8 --> 8724.64
nothing you're going to

8721.24 --> 8728.359
accomplish with it it will never be

8724.64 --> 8730.519999999999
proven everything I said is and will

8728.359 --> 8734.68
forever be true about

8730.52 --> 8738.16
it only thing you're doing is

8734.68 --> 8739.880000000001
presupposing a different scenario a

8738.16 --> 8743.399
different perspective on what's

8739.88 --> 8746.319
Happening you can't actually falsify it

8743.399 --> 8748.479
you're only presupposing something

8746.319 --> 8750.319
different that you can't prove because

8748.479 --> 8752.24
you're presupposing something that is a

8750.319 --> 8754.68
claim a claim of

8752.24 --> 8757.039999999999
motion yeah moving is something

8754.68 --> 8759.439
happening that makes it a claim

8757.04 --> 8761.479000000001
stationary is not something happening

8759.439 --> 8763.880000000001
which is not a

8761.479 --> 8767.56
claim it's

8763.88 --> 8767.56
over there's no

8779.24 --> 8782.24
recourse

8792.439 --> 8801.109
special pleading that's

8794.8 --> 8801.108999999999
[Music]

8809.24 --> 8812.24
right

8839.16 --> 8842.16
for

8861.68 --> 8864.84
o the

8862.68 --> 8868.359
sun

8864.84 --> 8868.359
woohoo look at

8869.12 --> 8875.399000000001
this

8871.88 --> 8875.399
Sun that's

8880.52 --> 8887.479000000001
great I can feel it I feel it scatter

8884.439 --> 8887.479000000001
onto me I love

8888.479 --> 8895.72
it not a lot but

8891.96 --> 8895.72
something more than I

8897.2 --> 8901.800000000001
expected the

8899.12 --> 8906.04
containers contained of

8901.8 --> 8909.438999999998
course uh yeah I mean it has to be

8906.04 --> 8909.439
contained otherwise we wouldn't be

8909.52 --> 8913.720000000001
breathing right contained one way or

8914.479 --> 8921.358999999999
another if you claim that there is more

8917.52 --> 8923.76
available space outside of the earth

8921.359 --> 8925.0
realm then the Earth realm still has to

8923.76 --> 8927.64
be

8925.0 --> 8929.479
contained it's like you can't escape a

8927.64 --> 8932.119999999999
form of containment it's literally

8929.479 --> 8934.8
impossible because there's stable air

8932.12 --> 8937.52
pressure it has to be contained there's

8934.8 --> 8940.96
no other choice it's a natural law that

8937.52 --> 8940.960000000001
cannot be avoided at any

8943.16 --> 8951.2
scale right there remains to be seen

8947.6 --> 8952.16
whether the containment that is here is

8951.2 --> 8955.76
a

8952.16 --> 8958.84
containment within another space which

8955.76 --> 8962.2
would also be contained CU just the

8958.84 --> 8965.439
sheer idea based on physics and natural

8962.2 --> 8967.08
law that there is infinite volume is

8965.439 --> 8971.12
total

8967.08 --> 8971.12
nonsense there cannot be infinite

8973.04 --> 8977.399000000001
volume logically there can't

8986.15 --> 8992.039999999999
[Music]

8989.04 --> 8992.04
be

8993.24 --> 8998.64
right glad you realize that Ken it's

8995.72 --> 9002.56
very important to know that that

8998.64 --> 9006.84
specific in the outer space idea is a

9002.56 --> 9008.319
big physics no no it's very good that

9006.84 --> 9012.479
you

9008.319 --> 9012.479
realize that we have to be

9018.96 --> 9024.099999999999
contained

9021.8 --> 9027.159
let's lift one another up not the

9024.1 --> 9027.159
[Music]

9028.16 --> 9032.6
Earth all right I'm doing my best to do

9033.92 --> 9039.76
that and I got all these interesting

9037.6 --> 9042.640000000001
things I can

9039.76 --> 9046.16
do like apply the

9042.64 --> 9047.439
technique so for example if I tell a

9046.16 --> 9050.8
really dark

9047.439 --> 9054.279
story about my paranoia or my visions

9050.8 --> 9058.278999999999
that are really dark to somebody

9054.279 --> 9060.52
now I I did that yesterday somebody and

9058.279 --> 9063.04
then afterward I was like oh my God it's

9060.52 --> 9066.560000000001
just talking about it too much like

9063.04 --> 9069.319000000001
brings it back it brings it back close I

9066.56 --> 9071.16
got a headache and I feel like oh no I

9069.319 --> 9074.319
feel like I'm going to fall back into

9071.16 --> 9076.68
that nightmare cuz that's kind of what

9074.319 --> 9079.92
happens right it's just like you bring

9076.68 --> 9083.16
up Trauma from your past you then talk

9079.92 --> 9085.04
talk about it in detail it like makes it

9083.16 --> 9088.6
close to you again like you're going to

9085.04 --> 9090.2
go through it again but because I now

9088.6 --> 9093.2
can apply the

9090.2 --> 9096.0
technique I can like

9093.2 --> 9098.960000000001
quickly dissolve that influence and I

9096.0 --> 9104.16
did so yesterday and I'm so like I feel

9098.96 --> 9106.16
so lucky I feel so lucky thank you God

9104.16 --> 9108.92
thank you God thank you Rudolph Steiner

9106.16 --> 9110.8
thank you my healer thank you that

9108.92 --> 9113.88
that's possible like can do that I can

9110.8 --> 9117.358999999999
like have an hour talk and bring up like

9113.88 --> 9120.199999999999
the darkest of Darkness that I faced and

9117.359 --> 9122.84
even feel it again in ways and like be

9120.2 --> 9126.16
almost sick about it and then at some

9122.84 --> 9128.84
point it's like okay now I'm stopping

9126.16 --> 9129.88
and I'm going to apply the technique and

9128.84 --> 9135.479
I do

9129.88 --> 9139.72
it and it's lifts and I'm free again I'm

9135.479 --> 9143.039999999999
like I'm out and I feel so lucky that I

9139.72 --> 9146.599999999999
can do that now in the past if I'd bring

9143.04 --> 9149.52
up dark experience or terrible

9146.6 --> 9153.52
things then if I brought that up I would

9149.52 --> 9157.640000000001
then dwell on that potentially for

9153.52 --> 9161.04
days just by bringing it back up now I

9157.64 --> 9165.08
can bring something up and bring it up

9161.04 --> 9167.560000000001
very far and then immediately undo its

9165.08 --> 9170.319
influence its negative influence that is

9167.56 --> 9172.8
there for bringing it up and could even

9170.319 --> 9174.439
do it with the other one cuz they're

9172.8 --> 9176.56
enduring the story they're like

9174.439 --> 9179.12
captivated but I mean it is going to

9176.56 --> 9181.76
like pull in on them in a dark way it's

9179.12 --> 9184.359
very scary some of the [Â __Â ] that I have

9181.76 --> 9187.279
to say about my

9184.359 --> 9189.6
past and so I could relieve them of it

9187.279 --> 9192.76
too so I can share information without

9189.6 --> 9198.16
leaving somebody with like the darkness

9192.76 --> 9201.399
eating on them and I'm so glad so

9198.16 --> 9203.72
thankful to God that that's possible

9201.399 --> 9208.64
thank you God thank you Creator thank

9203.72 --> 9214.08
you Jesus Christ thank you Rudolph

9208.64 --> 9216.68
Steiner thank you thank you thank you

9214.08 --> 9220.68
thank you I can do that and thank you

9216.68 --> 9224.16
that I can help others with that I am so

9220.68 --> 9224.16
incredibly thankful for

9228.72 --> 9231.72
that

9239.88 --> 9249.679999999998
[Music]

9258.72 --> 9261.72
a

9266.04 --> 9273.68
all right and I hope more people will

9270.359 --> 9276.24
join me and not just be like oh I don't

9273.68 --> 9277.880000000001
know what he's doing but it's all it's

9276.24 --> 9281.119999999999
of the

9277.88 --> 9284.358999999999
devil oh no he's not a trinitarian he

9281.12 --> 9288.04
doesn't follow our little riddle so that

9284.359 --> 9292.960000000001
means he goes to hell I hope people will

9288.04 --> 9292.960000000001
realize like uh no

9294.88 --> 9301.759999999998
no wasn't the whole point even in the

9297.76 --> 9303.16
Bible that you knew who was with the

9301.76 --> 9306.92
real

9303.16 --> 9306.92
God by how

9307.04 --> 9314.399000000001
effective their power

9309.72 --> 9316.56
was how effective God would help them am

9314.399 --> 9318.64
I not am I wrong about that can I ask

9316.56 --> 9321.84
you guys in the

9318.64 --> 9327.278999999999
chat wasn't that the whole point like

9321.84 --> 9329.68
our God is is real is the real God why

9327.279 --> 9332.76
because he does these Miracles and the

9329.68 --> 9335.68
healing and real things happening

9332.76 --> 9338.319
and predictions coming true isn't that

9335.68 --> 9340.6
like how you

9338.319 --> 9344.278999999999
recognize it's

9340.6 --> 9346.399000000001
real and in that sense I feel like by

9344.279 --> 9351.640000000001
something like the technique like yeah

9346.399 --> 9353.8
but it it really works it really works

9351.64 --> 9357.278999999999
so how could I then

9353.8 --> 9357.278999999999
be of the

9357.96 --> 9364.08
devil I've never heard of any kind of

9360.479 --> 9368.16
like satanic healing like

9364.08 --> 9368.16
that it's also

9372.24 --> 9379.0
bizarre it's bizarre to me that real

9376.279 --> 9381.84
Christians would think that I'm not a

9379.0 --> 9384.92
real Christian even though I apply a

9381.84 --> 9389.279
technique which is very close to prayer

9384.92 --> 9393.12
and in which I literally multiple times

9389.279 --> 9395.560000000001
invoke the name Jesus Christ I mean how

9393.12 --> 9399.52
could you then think I'm of the devil

9395.56 --> 9399.519999999999
like I don't understand that train of

9400.88 --> 9406.199999999999
thinking doesn't that name mean

9408.52 --> 9411.52
something

9417.279 --> 9423.2
I thought that was like the whole

9420.0 --> 9426.16
point that the name means something even

9423.2 --> 9429.52
to those that don't fully

9426.16 --> 9434.72
understand if you call Upon

9429.52 --> 9434.720000000001
Jesus Christ that the demons

9438.52 --> 9446.2
flee these things you shall do and More

9441.76 --> 9446.2
Jesus yes one of my favorite quotes

9458.8 --> 9465.08
also so I just hope that I'll get more

9461.84 --> 9467.960000000001
recognition that hey I am yeah I might

9465.08 --> 9471.16
not be a Bible scholar or whatever

9467.96 --> 9474.278999999999
always doing that every Sunday I'm not a

9471.16 --> 9477.119999999999
traditionalist in any sense not like Oh

9474.279 --> 9478.960000000001
I'm a traditionalist but I'm I disagree

9477.12 --> 9481.2
with these details and I'm going to do

9478.96 --> 9485.278999999999
it slightly like that no I'm

9481.2 --> 9487.84
just not a traditionalist at all I'm

9485.279 --> 9490.76
eclectic totally

9487.84 --> 9492.64
eclectic but I definitely recognize

9490.76 --> 9495.84
Jesus

9492.64 --> 9497.84
Christ in a very esoteric way that's why

9495.84 --> 9501.04
I call myself esoteric Christian

9497.84 --> 9504.439
eclectic esoteric Christian

9501.04 --> 9508.2
a follower of the path the middle path

9504.439 --> 9510.68
the narrow road it's all very esoteric

9508.2 --> 9512.359
and I take it extremely serious and I

9510.68 --> 9517.12
follow some of

9512.359 --> 9519.04
esoteric rules like God is truth Satan

9517.12 --> 9521.84
is

9519.04 --> 9525.080000000002
lies that's like very

9521.84 --> 9526.880000000001
prominent that that statement

9525.08 --> 9529.68
like

9526.88 --> 9531.319
overrules a lot of things in this this

9529.68 --> 9534.279
world for

9531.319 --> 9538.16
me a lot of

9534.279 --> 9541.359
claims it overrules it and that's how I

9538.16 --> 9544.399
do it and I just hope

9541.359 --> 9546.12
that more people will just be accepting

9544.399 --> 9550.64
of

9546.12 --> 9553.640000000001
it and just not think of me like I'm

9550.64 --> 9553.64
this

9553.8 --> 9561.358999999999
Antichrist Pretender or something cuz I

9558.359 --> 9561.359
mean

9563.08 --> 9567.72
with what I do I

9565.12 --> 9569.76
shouldn't like it it doesn't fall in

9567.72 --> 9572.96
line with what is said about the

9569.76 --> 9572.960000000001
Antichrist does

9573.76 --> 9578.76
it wasn't one of the things that about

9576.8 --> 9580.88
the Antichrist that he Master of the

9578.76 --> 9583.04
Bible and that he could that he would

9580.88 --> 9586.24
knew every part and that he would like a

9583.04 --> 9590.720000000001
lawyer be able to use it and twist

9586.24 --> 9594.76
it do I do that do I know everything

9590.72 --> 9599.278999999999
about it can I twist everything around I

9594.76 --> 9601.2
don't do that I follow my own form I

9599.279 --> 9603.960000000001
figure it out I'm eclectic so I'm

9601.2 --> 9608.240000000002
already like really not in

9603.96 --> 9610.919999999998
line with that idea that some people

9608.24 --> 9614.479
seem to sometimes have about

9610.92 --> 9618.92
me Christian people and I'm I just find

9614.479 --> 9622.599999999999
it tragic I mean it's not a huge burden

9618.92 --> 9626.319
it just means that it feels like they're

9622.6 --> 9629.56
weakened enough to have these illusion

9626.319 --> 9632.8
these delusions about

9629.56 --> 9636.88
me and I pity them for

9632.8 --> 9640.56
it that it doesn't actually threaten

9636.88 --> 9640.56
me I know what I'm

9645.2 --> 9651.960000000001
doing and I'm just very thankful to God

9648.16 --> 9653.92
that it just seemingly out of nowhere I

9651.96 --> 9655.679999999998
discovered the technique and I can apply

9653.92 --> 9659.960000000001
it I can apply it to

9655.68 --> 9662.359
people whose voice I've never heard

9659.96 --> 9664.72
whose face I've never

9662.359 --> 9667.960000000001
seen whose

9664.72 --> 9669.72
location I don't

9667.96 --> 9673.24
know

9669.72 --> 9676.92
yeah and it still

9673.24 --> 9682.16
works that's a miracle to

9676.92 --> 9686.279
me it's a miracle I feel like like I've

9682.16 --> 9688.439
got this glorious power just and it was

9686.279 --> 9690.319000000001
always there just for grabs all I needed

9688.439 --> 9693.880000000001
to do was

9690.319 --> 9697.84
just discard my own

9693.88 --> 9700.0
sin give up on the sin and just reach

9697.84 --> 9702.12
out and take it and it was always there

9700.0 --> 9706.0
and it just feel like this this world is

9702.12 --> 9709.92
so magical it's such a magical

9706.0 --> 9712.12
world and it in the real physical world

9709.92 --> 9714.72
it's not just in dreams I mean my dreams

9712.12 --> 9719.399000000001
are pretty magical I mean this morning I

9714.72 --> 9722.039999999999
had a dream that I went to an Elon Musk

9719.399 --> 9724.84
Factory and then I just started to fly

9722.04 --> 9728.640000000001
and like showed Elon Musk like hey I can

9724.84 --> 9731.24
fly and he got kind of like freaked out

9728.64 --> 9734.0
about it not skeptic but freaked out and

9731.24 --> 9736.199999999999
it's just like that's one of the most

9734.0 --> 9737.96
amazing things that I've ever dreamed

9736.2 --> 9741.640000000001
I've never dreamed of Elon Musk before

9737.96 --> 9746.0
but like to have him in that dream like

9741.64 --> 9748.72
really think about what was transpiring

9746.0 --> 9751.84
in the dream like that's a very unique

9748.72 --> 9754.599999999999
experience usually the people in my

9751.84 --> 9757.439
dreams that are just mostly I regard

9754.6 --> 9762.399000000001
them as simulations Similac that I've

9757.439 --> 9766.24
created They Don't Really Ponder upon

9762.399 --> 9770.278999999999
things I've never seen or never almost

9766.24 --> 9772.56
never seen anybody just like think

9770.279 --> 9775.12
in the

9772.56 --> 9778.439
dream so that was kind of like it makes

9775.12 --> 9781.479000000001
me think like did Elon Musk

9778.439 --> 9783.880000000001
actually like have this dream also or

9781.479 --> 9785.599999999999
something was this a conjoined dream

9783.88 --> 9787.039999999999
somehow did we connect up somehow I

9785.6 --> 9788.6
don't know he's probably not going to

9787.04 --> 9791.76
talk about it either

9788.6 --> 9795.479000000001
way but maybe that did actually maybe we

9791.76 --> 9795.479
like telepathically connected

9797.68 --> 9804.399
somehow I mean it's a bit of a stretch

9800.52 --> 9805.720000000001
though and the guy busy and like who am

9804.399 --> 9808.72
I you

9805.72 --> 9811.399
know to him if he'd actually remember

9808.72 --> 9814.399
that's just like yeah a weird wizard guy

9811.399 --> 9817.399
and I dreamed about him and that would

9814.399 --> 9820.92
probably be the extent of his of his

9817.399 --> 9824.08
care for it so but it really did stand

9820.92 --> 9826.92
out for me and that's why I thought I'm

9824.08 --> 9826.92
going to put it in the

9828.04 --> 9831.04
title

9835.84 --> 9840.16
tell yourself that others as a good

9837.439 --> 9840.16
night thing

9840.24 --> 9845.479
yeah is a show with that idea ien watch

9847.12 --> 9854.08
this connected Dreams yeah well Richard

9850.12 --> 9857.800000000001
G in the past I've

9854.08 --> 9861.68
had very distinct provable connected

9857.8 --> 9864.88
dreams so with the Jesuit guy he would

9861.68 --> 9867.279
basically connect up with me explain me

9864.88 --> 9869.278999999999
things that he refused to explain in the

9867.279 --> 9872.319000000001
real

9869.279 --> 9874.92
world it's how I in a very early stage

9872.319 --> 9878.0
in my life learned some stuff about flat

9874.92 --> 9881.04
earth when like in the late 90s when

9878.0 --> 9883.72
nobody was talking about it I learned

9881.04 --> 9886.359
some stuff through that type of dream

9883.72 --> 9889.64
connection and like the guy was

9886.359 --> 9893.359
consciously aware of it

9889.64 --> 9894.199999999999
would be like yeah yes I did tell you

9893.359 --> 9897.319
those

9894.2 --> 9902.960000000001
things in your

9897.319 --> 9907.64
dream so I know for a fact it's possible

9902.96 --> 9909.56
it's just that was like something that

9907.64 --> 9912.56
he knew

9909.56 --> 9915.039999999999
through weird occult knowledge or

9912.56 --> 9917.16
whatever weird cabala stuff I don't know

9915.04 --> 9919.080000000002
what the hell that was I don't know what

9917.16 --> 9919.92
the source of it was but it was like

9919.08 --> 9924.399
pretty

9919.92 --> 9927.04
scary he actively knew and did

9924.399 --> 9929.278999999999
that I don't think that that's what

9927.04 --> 9931.92
today was about it could have been an

9929.279 --> 9935.560000000001
accidental connection right you can

9931.92 --> 9939.64
potentially through interest through

9935.56 --> 9943.359
resonance this is my intuitive opinion

9939.64 --> 9943.358999999999
you could throw connection and

9943.56 --> 9949.56
resonance accidentally by happen stance

9947.76 --> 9953.2
dream connector

9949.56 --> 9956.519999999999
and then have the same dream over any

9953.2 --> 9959.68
distance that could be it it's like

9956.52 --> 9962.2
comparable to like how suddenly out of

9959.68 --> 9963.76
nowhere you just fall in love with the

9962.2 --> 9966.16
with another person even though you've

9963.76 --> 9968.16
met you've known them for a while

9966.16 --> 9971.039999999999
because suddenly you're like perfectly

9968.16 --> 9972.72
resonating in in a very deep way it's

9971.04 --> 9973.76
like a magic thing happens you have a

9972.72 --> 9976.519999999999
magical

9973.76 --> 9979.2
connection and that can potentially

9976.52 --> 9981.92
happen with different people even even

9979.2 --> 9983.399000000001
people you've never met face to face I

9981.92 --> 9986.72
don't

9983.399 --> 9989.76
know maybe it's because more recently

9986.72 --> 9992.24
I've just thought better of Elon

9989.76 --> 9996.12
Musk because there's been a lot of

9992.24 --> 9998.279
suspicions about him that's the creepy

9996.12 --> 10001.479000000001
stuff

9998.279 --> 10001.479000000001
but I

10003.04 --> 10011.319000000001
just I felt better about him in like the

10007.88 --> 10011.319
last few

10012.279 --> 10019.76
weeks I'm pretty sure there has been

10015.16 --> 10022.92
Darkness with him I mean he's rich and

10019.76 --> 10026.56
connected and there's no way to avoid

10022.92 --> 10028.72
that but there's also something good

10026.56 --> 10033.119999999999
about him and

10028.72 --> 10036.8
maybe maybe he felt that maybe he's

10033.12 --> 10039.08
aware of little old me in the nowhere

10036.8 --> 10044.0
corner on the internet and maybe he he

10039.08 --> 10046.8
sought to connect somehow maybe it was a

10044.0 --> 10049.92
test if someone is in your dream are you

10046.8 --> 10049.92
in theirs yes

10050.24 --> 10055.08
exactly well maybe the dreams if you're

10053.84 --> 10057.359
just

10055.08 --> 10060.68
resonating they just

10057.359 --> 10064.24
become locked in and

10060.68 --> 10067.12
then they are simultaneous they are

10064.24 --> 10070.84
parallel they're the same dream from

10067.12 --> 10070.84
different perspectives

10088.399 --> 10094.278999999999
see but in a way the environment if I'd

10092.12 --> 10096.800000000001
have to reason that one out seeking star

10094.279 --> 10099.640000000001
water the environment was like a

10096.8 --> 10104.56
supposed Elon Musk Factory

10099.64 --> 10109.039999999999
thing so it does feel like I came to

10104.56 --> 10112.6
him it was suggested to be his

10109.04 --> 10116.359
space like he owned that place in the

10112.6 --> 10118.92
dream so it seems like I was there to

10116.359 --> 10120.479000000001
visit and then I just started flying and

10118.92 --> 10121.16
like hey look at this yeah you could

10120.479 --> 10125.76
just

10121.16 --> 10125.76
fly but it was like his

10127.72 --> 10130.72
Factory

10133.72 --> 10139.519999999999
so if I'd have to choose I'd say that I

10136.359 --> 10139.52
may be entered his

10140.399 --> 10145.8
dream pretty sure that he's going to be

10142.88 --> 10150.278999999999
dreaming about his factories and all

10145.8 --> 10153.56
that cuz he is always doing that kind of

10150.279 --> 10155.04
thing and trying to work out what he's

10153.56 --> 10157.68
going to do how he's going to change

10155.04 --> 10160.76
things so that seems logical that he'd

10157.68 --> 10164.279
be dreaming about that kind of thing and

10160.76 --> 10165.800000000001
that I basically entered somehow by

10164.279 --> 10168.92
happen

10165.8 --> 10171.239
stance maybe because I had such a dark

10168.92 --> 10172.16
World conversation right before I went

10171.239 --> 10175.68
to

10172.16 --> 10178.119999999999
sleep I also because I like anticipated

10175.68 --> 10180.439
too like oh I'm going to probably dream

10178.12 --> 10183.439
something really intense thought it was

10180.439 --> 10185.960000000001
going to become a scary dream but then I

10183.439 --> 10185.960000000001
dream

10186.2 --> 10191.960000000001
this and despite it not being scar SC I

10189.52 --> 10195.6
still did wake up in a in a

10191.96 --> 10200.08
sweat which was also kind of weird not

10195.6 --> 10200.08
scary not in a panic it's just like

10200.279 --> 10203.68
whoa that was

10217.64 --> 10220.64
unexpected

10225.92 --> 10229.319
all right

10227.0 --> 10232.08
anyway hope you've all been enjoying the

10229.319 --> 10236.399
show I'm going to round out

10232.08 --> 10236.399
soon ah got 10 Rogan up

10237.04 --> 10241.720000000001
excellent glad you all

10239.239 --> 10243.6
enjoyed it's been kind of weird me

10241.72 --> 10246.199999999999
talking a lot about Elon Musk I mean

10243.6 --> 10247.640000000001
when do I talk about that guy that much

10246.2 --> 10251.279
you

10247.64 --> 10252.8
know and hey overall I really do kind of

10251.279 --> 10255.359
like

10252.8 --> 10260.84
Elon it's not

10255.359 --> 10265.04
perfect but it seems to me like his

10260.84 --> 10265.04
internal frequency is

10265.12 --> 10270.439
improving I'm taking notice of that I

10268.319 --> 10272.88
don't know if others agree to that I'm

10270.439 --> 10276.800000000001
taking notice of that I'm kind of

10272.88 --> 10280.199999999999
keeping track anyways I am kind of

10276.8 --> 10281.72
rooting for him because if he'd really

10280.2 --> 10285.12
climb out of the

10281.72 --> 10287.319
darkness that would be really good would

10285.12 --> 10289.68
be really good doesn't mean that he's

10287.319 --> 10292.479
going to end his rocket program and all

10289.68 --> 10296.960000000001
because that's just a thing that

10292.479 --> 10301.88
just adds to his overall popularity

10296.96 --> 10305.319
and like it's it's important for his

10301.88 --> 10307.519999999999
image so I get it it's like as a flat

10305.319 --> 10309.8
earther I forgive

10307.52 --> 10312.0
him

10309.8 --> 10314.519999999999
because it's like yeah I mean at least

10312.0 --> 10314.52
it's kind of

10314.64 --> 10321.76
entertaining I get it rocket launches

10318.239 --> 10321.76
makes a lot of people very

10322.399 --> 10327.8
excited it's just kind of sad the

10325.279 --> 10330.560000000001
realization that like it'll never

10327.8 --> 10333.599999999999
actually amount to anything

10330.56 --> 10336.119999999999
unless unless

10333.6 --> 10339.16
Elon knows the Earth is

10336.12 --> 10341.640000000001
flat but has ambitions

10339.16 --> 10345.0
to actually

10341.64 --> 10347.239
explore the thus far

10345.0 --> 10348.279
unreachable that would be fascinating

10347.239 --> 10351.8
wouldn't

10348.279 --> 10353.800000000001
it like we still don't know with

10351.8 --> 10358.479
absolute certainty how high it up it

10353.8 --> 10363.358999999999
goes maybe he wants to attempt to figure

10358.479 --> 10366.76
out a way how he could touch the top or

10363.359 --> 10369.92
establish permanently whether the top is

10366.76 --> 10372.6
where they think it is based on supposed

10369.92 --> 10375.359
radial signal

10372.6 --> 10378.720000000001
rebound maybe he just wants to actually

10375.359 --> 10381.84
test that wants to test more about the

10378.72 --> 10385.239
realm and who knows what what that could

10381.84 --> 10388.84
result into like maybe he

10385.239 --> 10391.0
is that the space ex like oh space

10388.84 --> 10394.239
exploration Mars that it's basically

10391.0 --> 10397.239
just a cover for

10394.239 --> 10399.6
genuine exploration and testing of the

10397.239 --> 10401.96
realm we're really in

10399.6 --> 10404.6
how would you

10401.96 --> 10407.8
know

10404.6 --> 10410.319
right so I'm willing to keep an open

10407.8 --> 10410.319
mind in

10422.16 --> 10425.8
that low ging

10427.439 --> 10430.439
wisdom

10447.279 --> 10453.239
okay there's no point in addressing it

10450.92 --> 10453.239
ging

10455.92 --> 10462.72
wisdom I

10459.12 --> 10465.0
simple I make no claim Earth is

10462.72 --> 10470.239
stationary I make no

10465.0 --> 10473.2
claim from that non claim it is very

10470.239 --> 10474.76
apparent and scientifically

10473.2 --> 10478.92
provable

10474.76 --> 10484.880000000001
that more dense thing go down less dense

10478.92 --> 10484.88
thing go up and so that's that it's

10487.319 --> 10490.319
over

10508.8 --> 10513.92
ftic Nev

10511.479 --> 10515.96
hello yeah you could think that all this

10513.92 --> 10520.319
stuff is cute it's just it doesn't

10515.96 --> 10520.319
amount to anything I mean

10523.68 --> 10528.0
whether they really believe it or not it

10525.88 --> 10531.438999999998
is technically

10528.0 --> 10532.96
misleading from this fact that

10531.439 --> 10536.399
stationary is not a

10532.96 --> 10540.438999999998
claim nothing happening isn't a claim

10536.399 --> 10543.92
and so we don't have to defend a nonaim

10540.439 --> 10545.76
scientifically argumentatively logically

10543.92 --> 10548.479
if you make a claim then you have to

10545.76 --> 10550.319
prove it and just presupposing it or

10548.479 --> 10552.399
looking at a situation that normally

10550.319 --> 10553.6
happens from a different vantage point

10552.399 --> 10557.239
with another

10553.6 --> 10560.68
presupposition is not proving

10557.239 --> 10562.399
it it's just like yeah the Earth is flat

10560.68 --> 10565.04
but I mean it's

10562.399 --> 10566.399
curved because of the celestial light

10565.04 --> 10568.92
angles and we're just going to

10566.399 --> 10571.64
presuppose that the Cur Earth is curved

10568.92 --> 10573.479
underneath well that's cute you could

10571.64 --> 10575.278999999999
think of it like that but it doesn't

10573.479 --> 10579.64
actually prove the Earth is curved

10575.279 --> 10583.239
underneath you see so it's the the same

10579.64 --> 10584.8
dilemma and it's a dead end it it

10583.239 --> 10587.319
doesn't amount to

10584.8 --> 10590.199999999999
anything except for children playing

10587.319 --> 10593.56
with bottles of water and eggs and

10590.2 --> 10593.560000000001
oranges as you

10603.0 --> 10608.399
say but I don't know some people just

10605.76 --> 10610.72
think a dead end is better than nothing

10608.399 --> 10612.84
it's better to just keep on walking into

10610.72 --> 10614.479
the same wall over and over again

10612.84 --> 10618.2
banging their head

10614.479 --> 10621.16
until until they can no

10618.2 --> 10623.6
longer and that's metaphorically what it

10621.16 --> 10627.119999999999
feels like to

10623.6 --> 10630.84
me that Dell is doing just that and I'm

10627.12 --> 10630.84
not going to waste my time and energy on

10632.08 --> 10637.16
it especially after he states that he is

10635.08 --> 10639.479
going to lie about me

10637.16 --> 10644.68
like

10639.479 --> 10644.679999999998
seriously who does that it's

10644.96 --> 10647.96
ridiculous

10667.12 --> 10670.12
right

10678.359 --> 10684.0
they trying to see the Common Ground

10680.319 --> 10685.96
okay okay gaining wisdom but I don't see

10684.0 --> 10692.12
what materialism has to do with it this

10685.96 --> 10692.119999999999
is all about philosophy and claim and

10692.359 --> 10698.880000000001
nonaim scientific method isn't

10696.16 --> 10701.08
materialistic scientific method

10698.88 --> 10705.08
includes

10701.08 --> 10705.08
information information is not

10705.8 --> 10713.72
Material so that statement is kind of

10710.64 --> 10717.599999999999
incorrect but I mean I understand that

10713.72 --> 10721.119999999999
it's generally difficult to

10717.6 --> 10723.52
grasp took me quite some

10721.12 --> 10725.399000000001
time but I'm confident that I've

10723.52 --> 10727.84
mastered it by

10725.399 --> 10731.278999999999
now I just know that whatever you're

10727.84 --> 10733.12
going to consider or look at how you

10731.279 --> 10736.800000000001
experience

10733.12 --> 10739.399000000001
things you could make anything about

10736.8 --> 10742.039999999999
what you experience relative and then

10739.399 --> 10744.72
consider it from a different presupposed

10742.04 --> 10747.279
vantage point of what is happening you

10744.72 --> 10749.358999999999
can do that you can presuppose oh what

10747.279 --> 10752.319000000001
if this is all because we're on an

10749.359 --> 10756.479000000001
upward Rising Earth you can do

10752.319 --> 10758.84
that but then you're resting on a

10756.479 --> 10760.64
presupposition of a claim of something

10758.84 --> 10763.279
happening and you're going to have to

10760.64 --> 10766.439
back that claim and you

10763.279 --> 10771.08
can't well if I just say Earth is

10766.439 --> 10773.52
stationary well then I claim a nothing

10771.08 --> 10775.64
happening and when you claim a nothing

10773.52 --> 10778.16
happening you don't have to back

10775.64 --> 10780.278999999999
it that's just logic that's just how

10778.16 --> 10784.52
that

10780.279 --> 10788.68
works so I have no evidence of Earth

10784.52 --> 10792.6
moving in any form whether it be rising

10788.68 --> 10795.359
or moving in any direction or spinning

10792.6 --> 10800.359
yeah no evidence for

10795.359 --> 10802.880000000001
that and so it's stationary and that's

10800.359 --> 10805.2
that if you want to prove it's not

10802.88 --> 10808.278999999999
stationary then you're going to have to

10805.2 --> 10810.76
back that claim with things other than a

10808.279 --> 10813.76
presupposition of it moving somehow and

10810.76 --> 10816.960000000001
not being able to actually falsify that

10813.76 --> 10820.92
so that's that that's where I rest my

10816.96 --> 10820.919999999998
case always

10828.399 --> 10835.64
have and and if you're interested in his

10832.08 --> 10837.64
ideas and his considerations then yeah

10835.64 --> 10839.92
well stick with them for as long as it

10837.64 --> 10842.64
interests you I mean I don't mind I'm

10839.92 --> 10844.359
not going to hit you for it but I'm

10842.64 --> 10845.519999999999
telling you now it's not going to amount

10844.359 --> 10848.479000000001
to

10845.52 --> 10852.880000000001
anything and I explain to you exactly

10848.479 --> 10854.92
why it's a dead end and I knew that at

10852.88 --> 10858.72
the very beginning of it that's why I

10854.92 --> 10861.8
did a show about it with it in the title

10858.72 --> 10864.08
addressing it's a dead

10861.8 --> 10866.84
end nothing has

10864.08 --> 10870.12
changed I well what has changed is that

10866.84 --> 10871.52
now I'm able to explain it even more

10870.12 --> 10873.880000000001
clearly and

10871.52 --> 10876.04
concisely that's really the only

10873.88 --> 10879.92
difference the vantage point of my

10876.04 --> 10879.92
argument hasn't changed

10885.279 --> 10892.08
right so I think I'm going to round out

10887.84 --> 10892.08
the show I've gone over three

10894.52 --> 10898.479000000001
hours looking forward to

10902.239 --> 10910.92
lunch spirituality be a dead end

10906.359 --> 10914.0
no but it's not not based in physics

10910.92 --> 10917.279
gaining wisdom but my show is not just

10914.0 --> 10919.2
exclusively about physics right you

10917.279 --> 10921.6
realize that that it's just two

10919.2 --> 10921.6
different

10923.04 --> 10929.399000000001
fields but no spirituality is definitely

10926.12 --> 10931.880000000001
not a de end absolutely not it's an

10929.399 --> 10934.92
inward

10931.88 --> 10937.278999999999
spiral that can go on

10934.92 --> 10941.92
eternally it's the only place where

10937.279 --> 10941.92
eternity can effectively be

10942.16 --> 10948.399
found not outward not in the physical

10945.239 --> 10951.76
world but inward in the spiritual

10948.399 --> 10954.88
world in the

10951.76 --> 10961.76
experience it's definitely not a dead

10954.88 --> 10961.759999999998
end it's the only lasting road to

10963.399 --> 10970.319
walk the only road you can keep walking

10966.16 --> 10970.319
you won't just end up by the dead

10972.88 --> 10978.519999999999
end

10974.56 --> 10982.039999999999
Inward and all major spiritual

10978.52 --> 10983.359
Traditions recognize that they all got

10982.04 --> 10986.239000000001
it

10983.359 --> 10989.68
right they got it right thousands of

10986.239 --> 10992.279
years ago and they got it right in this

10989.68 --> 10995.359
era that's how it works and that's what

10992.279 --> 10996.76
I'll be doing because I don't want to

10995.359 --> 10999.76
meet a dead

10996.76 --> 10999.76
end

11000.16 --> 11005.119999999999
I don't want

11001.399 --> 11008.599999999999
to do that I don't want to make a choice

11005.12 --> 11010.319000000001
and against better judgment go to a dead

11008.6 --> 11015.0
end I don't want to do

11010.319 --> 11015.0
that I'll pass on

11024.64 --> 11029.119999999999
that right but I mean spirituality is

11027.92 --> 11032.76
separate

11029.12 --> 11036.399000000001
from knowledge of the realm separate

11032.76 --> 11038.479
from Flat Earth and physics there two

11036.399 --> 11042.8
different

11038.479 --> 11044.84
things like the supposed two different

11042.8 --> 11047.319
activities in the two different parts of

11044.84 --> 11051.64
the brain they're both

11047.319 --> 11055.76
there you use them both but what they do

11051.64 --> 11055.76
is very different according

11055.88 --> 11059.72
to how that is regarded

11060.68 --> 11067.68
see so if I'm never going to like fall

11064.84 --> 11069.64
back on the spirituality to try to make

11067.68 --> 11073.279
a flat Earth

11069.64 --> 11073.278999999999
argument I wouldn't need

11076.04 --> 11083.04
to it's not of that field

11080.56 --> 11086.64
perspective what

11083.04 --> 11089.640000000001
perspective you mean Optics

11086.64 --> 11092.84
perspective because that is also physics

11089.64 --> 11095.479
Optics is physics and so perspective

11092.84 --> 11100.16
within Optics is also physics it's very

11095.479 --> 11100.16
much physical it's not

11116.64 --> 11119.64
spiritual

11122.399 --> 11126.559
marriage

11123.43 --> 11126.559000000001
[Music]

11129.88 --> 11137.759999999998
okay you can't really marry it I mean

11133.239 --> 11141.039999999999
the spiritual and the physical are

11137.76 --> 11143.399
incompatible the one and a

11141.04 --> 11146.640000000001
zero the yin and the

11143.399 --> 11148.519999999999
Yang they're not

11146.64 --> 11151.479
compatible

11148.52 --> 11153.84
when you mix them like oil and water

11151.479 --> 11157.0
they eventually separate again because

11153.84 --> 11160.72
they're not compatible they're not

11157.0 --> 11162.439
one now you need both oil and water in

11160.72 --> 11164.119999999999
your

11162.439 --> 11167.439
body

11164.12 --> 11171.6
right but they will never be

11167.439 --> 11174.880000000001
one the body two separates

11171.6 --> 11176.56
them and puts them in different places

11174.88 --> 11179.56
to do different

11176.56 --> 11179.56
things

11179.72 --> 11186.64
oil and water right and that's our

11183.279 --> 11191.439
regard physics and spirituality you need

11186.64 --> 11194.84
them both but they're not directly

11191.439 --> 11194.84
involved with each

11206.52 --> 11209.52
other

11224.8 --> 11230.16
right

11226.479 --> 11232.92
so I'm rounding out thanks for the

11230.16 --> 11234.68
uh conversation getting wisdom at the

11232.92 --> 11236.76
last moment was

11234.68 --> 11239.52
interesting hope everybody enjoyed the

show out there

11240.56 --> 11244.6
been several different

11244.64 --> 11248.96
subjects that really don't relate to one

11247.16 --> 11251.479
another but it's been interesting enough

11248.96 --> 11255.16
for me at least I thought the whole

11251.479 --> 11258.039999999999
dream was interesting I'm still thinking

11255.16 --> 11260.68
about it but I pretty much explain

11258.04 --> 11264.399000000001
everything there is to explain about

11260.68 --> 11266.52
it so thanks everyone for coming I hope
