that would be much appreciated

92.88 --> 101.84
so today the weather is

96.96 --> 101.83999999999999
hot and moist

107.36 --> 112.72
i might be taking my shirt off somewhere

110.399 --> 115.84
during the show because it's just really

112.72 --> 115.84
too hot

117.28 --> 122.07900000000001
it's not as blue it's a lot more moist

119.84 --> 124.71900000000001
up there in the air

122.079 --> 125.759
maybe it is though because of just the

124.719 --> 128.79999999999998
the trailing

125.759 --> 131.84
that has happened since yesterday

128.8 --> 136.16000000000003
it's weird but yeah

131.84 --> 136.16
clouded but it's it's actually warmer

140.84 --> 143.84
ugh

146.879 --> 153.51899999999998
all right i

150.0 --> 156.64
took a shower about an hour ago

153.519 --> 159.76
that was really necessary so it was just

156.64 --> 159.76
getting too sticky

160.48 --> 167.2
so i do feel freshened up hey and i'm

164.0 --> 167.2
almost on time

167.519 --> 172.72
hello tom parker first in chat good to

170.4 --> 172.72
see you

172.959 --> 182.48000000000002
it is wednesday

177.28 --> 182.48
the 9th of june 2021

186.879 --> 191.84
and things are good

194.72 --> 201.84
had a good night rest

198.319 --> 204.64
didn't manage to keep it not too late

201.84 --> 206.0
and also especially to wind down before

204.64 --> 209.67999999999998
i go to bed

206.0 --> 209.68
that's an important thing i've noticed

210.84 --> 216.879
eh

212.08 --> 216.87900000000002
no tom parker no

216.959 --> 230.31900000000002
cryptocurrency really

227.519 --> 231.12
okay i could answer some basic questions

230.319 --> 233.67999999999998
about it but

231.12 --> 241.84
i am anything but an expert especially

233.68 --> 241.84
to the intricacies

242.56 --> 246.159
it's basically just a

249.12 --> 256.16
like a digital form of fiat paper

252.84 --> 260.0
except there is

256.16 --> 260.88000000000005
just like every currency technically has

260.0 --> 263.919
its own

260.88 --> 264.32
specific type of code and mark and it's

263.919 --> 267.44
part

264.32 --> 269.44
of the digital code right

267.44 --> 270.56
but it also even depends on the type of

269.44 --> 272.8
cryptocurrencies

270.56 --> 274.479
like it's really just a new form of

272.8 --> 277.28000000000003
digital paper

274.479 --> 277.919
many ways and some cryptocurrencies have

277.28 --> 281.59999999999997
a lot of

277.919 --> 284.479
yeah or have more content more backing

281.6 --> 285.28000000000003
are taken more serious have a special

284.479 --> 288.15999999999997
unique

285.28 --> 290.96
limit that is technically possible like

288.16 --> 290.96000000000004
like bitcoin

291.36 --> 298.24
which makes them a virtual

295.44 --> 299.199
limited resource right so there's all

298.24 --> 302.56
kinds of like

299.199 --> 305.6
market value games involved

302.56 --> 310.0
in what the value of cryptocurrency

305.6 --> 315.12
it's but it's not the ultimate

310.0 --> 315.12
solution it's only really the next game

322.84 --> 328.08
and

325.759 --> 330.88
yeah and there's already a lot of hassle

328.08 --> 334.08
happening out there with it

330.88 --> 334.08
it seems like it is

335.199 --> 342.0
manipulable in the sense that markets

338.72 --> 345.03900000000004
it's not uh free of

342.0 --> 347.919
markets of market rig swings

345.039 --> 352.15999999999997
like what the the oligarchy does

347.919 --> 355.44
sometimes just

352.16 --> 358.88000000000005
basically rip something apart by over

355.44 --> 361.68
investing and selling and

358.88 --> 364.0
manipulating everything with it right so

361.68 --> 367.039
yeah cryptocurrency it's not

364.0 --> 369.919
it's not the ultimate win freedom

367.039 --> 372.479
thing that we can get rid of the bankers

369.919 --> 372.479
from but

373.52 --> 378.15999999999997
if there is enough of it like it's

378.319 --> 383.91900000000004
there is one potential

382.08 --> 386.4
that can come out of it though and that

383.919 --> 386.4
is that

386.479 --> 389.68
if the people really take it very

388.4 --> 391.35999999999996
seriously

389.68 --> 393.44
then they can basically use

391.36 --> 397.039
cryptocurrency

393.44 --> 398.319
as an easy convention to specifically

397.039 --> 402.8
and purposely

398.319 --> 405.68
bypass banks and the banks know this

402.8 --> 406.319
they're very scared of that because they

405.68 --> 409.12
are

406.319 --> 410.0
holding things together with their power

409.12 --> 413.199
and this thing

410.0 --> 416.4
will or could if people realize it

413.199 --> 418.96000000000004
and will do it eventually bypass some of

416.4 --> 418.96
their power

419.199 --> 422.96000000000004
create a convention that makes us able

422.479 --> 426.639
to

422.96 --> 428.56
completely bypass banks and they don't

426.639 --> 430.96000000000004
want that they're supposed to keep a

428.56 --> 430.96
finger

431.599 --> 438.0
in the bowl that's that's what they do

435.759 --> 440.319
they don't like to be excluded right

438.0 --> 443.36
that's why they're giving cryptocurrency

440.319 --> 448.319
in general a lot of hassle

443.36 --> 448.319
in all ways they can figure out

448.84 --> 451.84
right

455.039 --> 459.599
so really it's up to

460.88 --> 468.96
people with products with production

464.08 --> 472.479
with things that are have trade value

468.96 --> 476.23999999999995
to then use it with others and

472.479 --> 478.56
or at first right the thing is

476.24 --> 479.68
before we even get to that stage we're

478.56 --> 481.84
going to have to sit through

479.68 --> 484.16
everybody in the world pretty much

481.84 --> 486.23999999999995
through scammers

484.16 --> 488.47900000000004
we have to learn about how that works

486.24 --> 492.56
like when something

488.479 --> 495.75899999999996
is a scam and when it has proper backing

492.56 --> 498.96
and um

495.759 --> 502.40000000000003
checks and balances built into it

498.96 --> 504.56
right that has to all be revealed

502.4 --> 507.67999999999995
and now of course the the real crypto

504.56 --> 510.479
masters they already know all of this

507.68 --> 511.199
right but since it's being pushed on the

510.479 --> 513.919
wider

511.199 --> 516.479
public it's going to be important that

513.919 --> 519.4399999999999
everybody figures that out

516.479 --> 520.0
it's very careful don't think like oh if

519.44 --> 523.44
you go for

520.0 --> 526.88
crypto that means you win or something

523.44 --> 530.1600000000001
note you can't play crypto and win

526.88 --> 535.8389999999999
unless you invest

530.16 --> 535.8389999999999
skills and energy in it right

536.16 --> 540.64
just like the original idea with bitcoin

540.08 --> 543.12
like it

540.64 --> 545.12
it eats a lot of energy to generate a

543.12 --> 548.8
bitcoin to mine one

545.12 --> 552.24
right well to deal with it

548.8 --> 555.279
also requires skill and energy

552.24 --> 558.48
from the person right

555.279 --> 558.48
it's like a profession

558.56 --> 563.8389999999999
a profession requires dedication and

561.92 --> 566.56
energy and skill investment and

563.839 --> 567.7600000000001
and basically cryptocurrency is a new

566.56 --> 570.959
thing

567.76 --> 574.8389999999999
and it is so elaborate that you could

570.959 --> 576.399
basically classify it as a new

574.839 --> 579.44
profession

576.399 --> 582.64
because it requires attention focus

579.44 --> 586.32
and skill investment to to actually

582.64 --> 586.959
do good with it but at the same time

586.32 --> 590.1600000000001
yeah

586.959 --> 592.959
is that worth it on the long run

590.16 --> 596.24
how much will it hold up will the skill

592.959 --> 596.2399999999999
investment be worth it

597.6 --> 607.519
that's a tough one for a lot of people

604.48 --> 609.76
all right so as far as it goes with me

607.519 --> 610.8
i approach it like i do with almost

609.76 --> 615.2
everything

610.8 --> 617.4399999999999
it's just weird in my way

615.2 --> 619.0400000000001
i'm not really understanding it not

617.44 --> 623.12
digging too deep into it

619.04 --> 626.399
but i do read about it to hear about it

623.12 --> 629.68
and i'm building a model

626.399 --> 633.839
based on the cross-references and that's

629.68 --> 633.8389999999999
how i come to these conclusions

637.04 --> 641.519
all right so i'm typically somebody that

639.44 --> 643.519
pays attention to like okay you're a

641.519 --> 646.32
crypto enthusiast

643.519 --> 648.5600000000001
what are your symptoms like what is it

646.32 --> 648.5600000000001
like

649.44 --> 654.1600000000001
right like what are you preoccupied with

652.64 --> 656.959
what is your energy level

654.16 --> 659.1999999999999
what is your anxiety level how obsessive

656.959 --> 662.3199999999999
are you

659.2 --> 665.44
do you still have senses for

662.32 --> 666.9590000000001
other things right all these details so

665.44 --> 668.8800000000001
i'm just paying attention

666.959 --> 671.92
to what is that how is it going to

668.88 --> 674.48
manifest how will it typically manifest

671.92 --> 676.64
into somebody that gets into it and then

674.48 --> 677.839
i can basically model out personal

676.64 --> 681.12
changes

677.839 --> 684.32
roughly estimated

681.12 --> 687.04
like how will it typically change people

684.32 --> 689.12
is that good is that bad will that help

687.04 --> 690.64
them to skills that they might need in

689.12 --> 693.12
future events

690.64 --> 695.279
in other fields right that are to come

693.12 --> 699.04
because there will be more fields

695.279 --> 699.04
of things like this

700.0 --> 703.839
new technologies

704.24 --> 707.2
there's more to come

707.44 --> 712.639
anyway hello seeking star wars

715.12 --> 723.92
nathan r good servant good to see you

720.72 --> 725.6
so tom parker i hope that is a somewhat

723.92 --> 729.04
satisfactory answer

725.6 --> 732.72
to a question that i don't really like

729.04 --> 735.36
to talk too much about cryptocurrency

732.72 --> 738.24
it's a bit of a it like it still makes

735.36 --> 738.24
me a little nervous

741.279 --> 759.36
and there's just so much of it

745.12 --> 761.76
alright good good to hear tom parker

759.36 --> 763.04
all right yeah yeah geranism is going

761.76 --> 765.76
for crypto

763.04 --> 766.48
right and hey the symptoms right but

765.76 --> 769.4399999999999
he's

766.48 --> 769.76
he's a smart guy and he has skill range

769.44 --> 773.2790000000001
so

769.76 --> 774.8
yeah he could he could become really

773.279 --> 777.92
good at it

774.8 --> 779.76
certainly has the sensory and all that

777.92 --> 782.959
it's all a matter of if he maintains

779.76 --> 782.959
that it probably will

785.12 --> 788.399
and there's others too that have gone

787.6 --> 790.399
full crypto

788.399 --> 792.8
the problem is though and this is why i

790.399 --> 795.92
said mention it in the list

792.8 --> 798.399
obsessiveness right there's so

795.92 --> 799.279
much about crypto that is happening

798.399 --> 803.68
events

799.279 --> 808.639
new cryptos new rules figuring it out

803.68 --> 810.6389999999999
weird trade setup alterations

808.639 --> 812.399
like oh now you can trade this script oh

810.639 --> 813.04
now you can with that oh no there's a

812.399 --> 815.36
new

813.04 --> 817.1999999999999
it's constantly [ __ ] happening in the

815.36 --> 819.6800000000001
market with that

817.2 --> 820.32
and that's why people that deal with

819.68 --> 824.0
that talk

820.32 --> 828.32
that go for it become

824.0 --> 830.56
get into cryptocurrency they

828.32 --> 831.6
rarely even talk about other things

830.56 --> 834.56
anymore

831.6 --> 835.9200000000001
that's why i said obsession there is a

834.56 --> 837.68
lot to talk about but

835.92 --> 840.56
really i've just noticed that people

837.68 --> 840.56
that get into it

840.839 --> 846.1600000000001
really

842.16 --> 849.8389999999999
start to lose lose the extra space

846.16 --> 853.4399999999999
to just freely think about other things

849.839 --> 855.12
like i have i've noticed that so it is

853.44 --> 857.7600000000001
kind of a warning

855.12 --> 858.8
to the field anybody getting into it

857.76 --> 862.0
like

858.8 --> 865.199
pay attention to what you do

862.0 --> 868.16
don't really railroad yourself

865.199 --> 868.8
enormously in it don't become obsessed

868.16 --> 871.92
with it

868.8 --> 875.68
don't forget to uphold and maintain

871.92 --> 875.68
other things in your life as well

878.399 --> 886.639
you got 20 bucks worth of crypto

881.519 --> 886.639
okay that i got some myself

886.8 --> 898.7199999999999
basically just moving it around from

889.76 --> 904.3199999999999
through the gti was a giant hassle

898.72 --> 907.36
but yeah to me i'm treating crypto more

904.32 --> 911.1990000000001
more like a collector like

907.36 --> 915.12
uh collecting special games or

911.199 --> 916.88
cards you know because an actual trader

915.12 --> 920.48
it gives me a freaking headache

916.88 --> 922.48
and you really have to have like

920.48 --> 924.839
you have to have some gravel in you yeah

922.48 --> 927.76
you really got to be sharp on the

924.839 --> 930.639
numbers

927.76 --> 932.24
to to get ahead you really got to figure

930.639 --> 937.04
out how to do that

932.24 --> 939.44
and i don't like that i never have

937.04 --> 940.88
so i'm just using it like oh i could get

939.44 --> 942.639
this

940.88 --> 944.399
so i just get it and just see what

942.639 --> 948.399
happens but i i'm very

944.399 --> 951.92
passive overall with my crypto

948.399 --> 952.959
storage i'm not like always staring at

951.92 --> 954.4799999999999
the graph like oh

952.959 --> 956.2399999999999
is it going to go down am i going to buy

954.48 --> 959.36
it now or

956.24 --> 963.04
oh when i'm going to sell no i i don't

959.36 --> 963.04
like staring at that graph

963.839 --> 969.839
never have

973.12 --> 979.92
makes you very influenceable to

976.639 --> 982.399
to graph fantasies that media might also

979.92 --> 984.56
be fooling around with because of that

982.399 --> 989.36
you stare at graphs a lot

984.56 --> 989.3599999999999
makes you more vulnerable to suggestion

994.839 --> 998.0
uh

996.0 --> 999.519
he's changing his subject matter trying

998.0 --> 1002.72
to get promoted by you

999.519 --> 1002.72
what you think so

1008.639 --> 1015.519
well jaron is still a flat earther

1012.16 --> 1016.399
like maybe you you will call it a globe

1015.519 --> 1020.24
skeptic but

1016.399 --> 1021.92
look jaren come on like he's not gonna

1020.24 --> 1022.9590000000001
go back to the globe or anything there's

1021.92 --> 1025.12
no way

1022.959 --> 1027.039
but he might just try to avoid the

1025.12 --> 1030.3999999999999
subject

1027.039 --> 1030.72
and then get some foot in the door with

1030.4 --> 1035.76
his

1030.72 --> 1035.76
crypto developments yeah sure

1037.199 --> 1043.6000000000001
hey nathan oakley 1980 good to see you

1040.48 --> 1043.6
great show yesterday

1047.69 --> 1053.8400000000001
[Music]

1050.84 --> 1053.84
huh

1074.559 --> 1082.08
yeah yeah well he opened up

1078.88 --> 1083.2
crypto donations and had some mention of

1082.08 --> 1095.039
it

1083.2 --> 1100.16
for quite a while that's that's right

1095.039 --> 1100.16
still does shows with david weiss okay

1101.039 --> 1109.84
i wouldn't see why not

1130.559 --> 1137.84
get some juice

1139.7 --> 1145.42
[Music]

1156.4 --> 1165.8400000000001
rockfin only what

1187.2 --> 1193.3600000000001
you think the truth is important well

1190.16 --> 1197.1200000000001
yeah of course good servant

1193.36 --> 1200.7199999999998
but so does jaron i don't see

1197.12 --> 1200.7199999999998
what he's doing that

1200.96 --> 1207.8400000000001
would suggest that he didn't think it

1202.88 --> 1207.8400000000001
was important anymore

1208.4 --> 1212.48
yeah well a lot of them all worked for

1211.039 --> 1215.039
each other and [ __ ]

1212.48 --> 1215.039
you know they

1216.24 --> 1221.84
it's a free business why not

1225.12 --> 1235.84
just working together on projects

1256.64 --> 1266.159
ah man i'm cooking here

1263.12 --> 1268.3999999999999
maybe next half in a half an hour the

1266.159 --> 1269.2
sun won't be hitting this wall anymore

1268.4 --> 1277.8400000000001
god

1269.2 --> 1277.8400000000001
so hard

1288.84 --> 1291.84
ugh

1316.84 --> 1322.32
so

1319.36 --> 1324.559
oh yeah by the way talking about crypto

1322.32 --> 1327.12
i'd like to remind everybody that i do

1324.559 --> 1330.08
have a crypto wallet

1327.12 --> 1332.2399999999998
i it's reactivated i had to change it

1330.08 --> 1333.9189999999999
because the old wallets just completely

1332.24 --> 1336.24
useless

1333.919 --> 1338.0
i can't even withdraw anything from

1336.24 --> 1342.24
there

1338.0 --> 1346.88
unless i like pay like for 40 bucks

1342.24 --> 1350.08
it's ridiculous

1346.88 --> 1353.679
so but there are new

1350.08 --> 1353.6789999999999
crypto links in there

1354.72 --> 1361.6000000000001
let's see i haven't really checked up in

1358.48 --> 1365.76
a while

1361.6 --> 1365.76
see if i got something from somebody

1365.84 --> 1375.84
it is kind of fun

1376.72 --> 1389.84
no it seems pretty much wait is this the

1380.0 --> 1389.84
right one

1407.28 --> 1417.84
wait what

1428.84 --> 1431.84
hmm

1434.88 --> 1441.7600000000002
ah it's cloudy over there nathan hour

1438.48 --> 1443.52
okay that's nice well there's some

1441.76 --> 1444.0
clouds over here too but they're like

1443.52 --> 1450.24
really

1444.0 --> 1450.24
thin they're not gonna be blocking the

1456.84 --> 1459.84
sun

1473.84 --> 1479.84
hmm okay yes seeking star water but

1481.039 --> 1485.679
that temperature isn't that supposed to

1483.279 --> 1487.919
be the ground level temperature because

1485.679 --> 1489.44
temperatures like even in the summer can

1487.919 --> 1492.5590000000002
wildly differentiate

1489.44 --> 1492.559
depending on the height

1498.96 --> 1503.679
right so there could be i don't know it

1502.32 --> 1505.76
might be a little

1503.679 --> 1507.919
unusual circumstance but that there's

1505.76 --> 1511.44
just big clouds

1507.919 --> 1515.1200000000001
there's snow coming out of them the snow

1511.44 --> 1519.1200000000001
melts quickly after a certain

1515.12 --> 1521.1999999999998
length of dropping then turns to water

1519.12 --> 1522.6399999999999
that fall keeps falling and then

1521.2 --> 1525.2
eventually hits the

1522.64 --> 1527.679
the hot air front and then simply

1525.2 --> 1532.799
dissolves

1527.679 --> 1532.799
through that right

1533.039 --> 1536.72
it's all kinds of things possible

1537.279 --> 1540.72
it's all about the temperature layers

1539.76 --> 1542.64
that

1540.72 --> 1545.44
that's where most of the weirdness comes

1542.64 --> 1545.44
from in weather

1554.84 --> 1557.84
right

1558.96 --> 1562.159
hello tiny bumble

1563.12 --> 1566.4799999999998
wanna ask me a question sure i just

1565.279 --> 1571.84
talked about it this

1566.48 --> 1571.84
segment but fine go ahead

1601.76 --> 1607.12
okay so i guess cryptocurrencies back on

1606.24 --> 1610.159
the menu

1607.12 --> 1613.36
over at media world or something

1610.159 --> 1615.2
so many people are coming for for this

1613.36 --> 1616.799
let's browse around let's see if there's

1615.2 --> 1619.039
some special

1616.799 --> 1619.039
oh

1624.84 --> 1627.84
okay

1646.0 --> 1653.12
okay bumping into article about

1649.679 --> 1656.0800000000002
inflation right yet

1653.12 --> 1657.039
that's the thing you see all the

1656.08 --> 1659.6789999999999
governments

1657.039 --> 1659.679
everywhere

1662.72 --> 1667.1200000000001
and big the big corporate banks in our

1665.84 --> 1669.12
world bank

1667.12 --> 1671.1999999999998
they've all been printing so much money

1669.12 --> 1674.2399999999998
everywhere

1671.2 --> 1677.279
that fiat currency that

1674.24 --> 1678.0
for whatever it is worth like and hey

1677.279 --> 1680.159
there is

1678.0 --> 1681.12
fiat currencies can be a very great

1680.159 --> 1683.5200000000002
system

1681.12 --> 1684.1589999999999
if it is kept in balance right it's

1683.52 --> 1686.96
dealt with

1684.159 --> 1689.279
reasonably because it can grow out of

1686.96 --> 1690.3990000000001
hand and basically you get a zimbabwe

1689.279 --> 1694.08
situation

1690.399 --> 1697.52
well it's getting closer to that

1694.08 --> 1698.0
because the powers that be that use all

1697.52 --> 1701.36
that

1698.0 --> 1702.799
that get get to get a say over the

1701.36 --> 1706.0
printing

1702.799 --> 1708.84
they've been just abusing it

1706.0 --> 1710.159
at an increase as an at an expand

1708.84 --> 1713.12
exponentially

1710.159 --> 1713.1200000000001
increasing rate

1714.559 --> 1717.9189999999999
so yeah inflation's bound to hit and

1717.52 --> 1722.559
then

1717.919 --> 1722.5590000000002
people might think of okay let's go to

1722.84 --> 1725.84
cryptocurrency

1727.44 --> 1730.88
at least as a temporary protection right

1730.48 --> 1734.559
because

1730.88 --> 1736.5590000000002
inflation is like inevitable

1734.559 --> 1738.32
and this sort of thing happens you can't

1736.559 --> 1744.0
bypass that even within

1738.32 --> 1744.0
its own system cryptocurrencies could

1744.399 --> 1748.32
but it has its own dangers

1749.279 --> 1753.84
all right

1760.64 --> 1767.6000000000001
like the only real safe winning

1763.76 --> 1771.76
investment that you can make

1767.6 --> 1775.4399999999998
is things that are directly around you

1771.76 --> 1778.72
like a piece of land that you

1775.44 --> 1781.1200000000001
live at for real and a farm that you

1778.72 --> 1784.32
work on

1781.12 --> 1787.12
and a family that you live with

1784.32 --> 1788.96
and that you teach right those are the

1787.12 --> 1793.1999999999998
investments

1788.96 --> 1793.2
now those are zero inflation

1793.279 --> 1796.159
if you do it right

1800.32 --> 1804.399
huh check my wallet just gave me some

1802.88 --> 1808.72
bitcoin oh really

1804.399 --> 1811.76
okay thank you a you backup 40.

1808.72 --> 1811.76
i'll check it out that's

1811.84 --> 1823.84
interesting see hope i can find it

1824.64 --> 1837.8400000000001
ah come on

1840.0 --> 1843.36
where did you send it

1847.36 --> 1851.84
did give you the right code right

1853.2 --> 1855.3600000000001
see

1857.76 --> 1860.72
pc what

1861.919 --> 1869.2
oh god

1864.96 --> 1879.8400000000001
where is i forgot where i

1869.2 --> 1879.8400000000001
put it [ __ ]

1905.6 --> 1908.6399999999999
anyway yeah thank you dude i feel a

1907.36 --> 1911.6789999999999
little embarrassed because i

1908.64 --> 1915.6000000000001
i i don't know where

1911.679 --> 1920.72
where oh what's that on my desktop

1915.6 --> 1923.9189999999999
hold on i think i remember now

1920.72 --> 1923.919
where the hell is that thing

1928.72 --> 1935.84
what's this it

1938.159 --> 1963.8400000000001
yeah i think it is

1948.72 --> 1963.84
okay okay

1972.64 --> 1979.919
is this it this should be it

1976.159 --> 1979.919
sorry for taking so long

1980.72 --> 1983.84
yeah this should be it

1984.08 --> 1986.399
right

1989.44 --> 1992.3990000000001
0.2

1992.88 --> 1997.1200000000001
yeah that that is whoa that is a lot

1995.84 --> 1999.6789999999999
dude

1997.12 --> 1999.6789999999999
serious

2000.32 --> 2006.08
so i haven't received it yet though

2004.0 --> 2008.24
and they haven't had a notification i

2006.08 --> 2009.1999999999998
don't know if this takes some time

2008.24 --> 2013.1200000000001
before it

2009.2 --> 2013.1200000000001
before it is received

2016.159 --> 2022.64
how much is that

2019.76 --> 2022.64
is this for real

2024.48 --> 2033.3600000000001
or are you just trolling me people have

2027.679 --> 2037.519
trolled me with that before

2033.36 --> 2037.519
whoa what

2038.88 --> 2045.2
damn okay

2042.32 --> 2048.48
i could sure use that i guess if look

2045.2 --> 2052.639
even that amount though

2048.48 --> 2053.52
if i could actually literally translate

2052.639 --> 2055.44
that into

2053.52 --> 2056.879
money in some way that i could get

2055.44 --> 2059.119
physically into my hands

2056.879 --> 2060.0789999999997
i'd be surprised if it would really end

2059.119 --> 2063.44
up to that amount

2060.079 --> 2064.3990000000003
though right every time you try to get

2063.44 --> 2068.96
something out

2064.399 --> 2072.0
it always costs but anyway

2068.96 --> 2075.839
cool dude if this is real i do have to

2072.0 --> 2075.839
refresh or something

2078.56 --> 2089.839
how the hell is his wreck

2121.52 --> 2125.2
yeah agm that's fine

2129.599 --> 2132.6400000000003
i'll find some good purpose for it don't

2131.839 --> 2135.92
worry

2132.64 --> 2136.48
and hey even look gti the thing that i'm

2135.92 --> 2139.839
with

2136.48 --> 2143.119
it has a company store so

2139.839 --> 2145.2799999999997
and they deal with bitcoin right

2143.119 --> 2147.52
look technically if i got like a whole

2145.28 --> 2150.4
bunch of this bitcoin stuff

2147.52 --> 2150.4
i could literally

2150.56 --> 2159.2
like very cheaply rent a car

2154.32 --> 2162.88
through gti

2159.2 --> 2165.1189999999997
is not gta and gti

2162.88 --> 2167.119
but i don't know it's pretty cool dude

2165.119 --> 2168.4
but uh yeah i haven't really received

2167.119 --> 2173.839
anything yet i don't know

2168.4 --> 2173.839
how long the delay typically is on this

2175.04 --> 2179.52
right i'm not in a hurry at all like i

2176.96 --> 2182.96
must have a car

2179.52 --> 2185.52
though it would be nice again and for me

2182.96 --> 2186.48
i don't know my priorities is like

2185.52 --> 2189.7599999999998
getting some new

2186.48 --> 2189.76
shoes and [ __ ] right

2190.56 --> 2194.0789999999997
and i'm having my my leather jacket

2193.359 --> 2198.56
fixed

2194.079 --> 2198.5600000000004
too it's that's costly by the way

2198.839 --> 2202.7999999999997
right getting a new one would have

2201.28 --> 2205.0400000000004
probably been cheaper but

2202.8 --> 2207.52
the place where i got it i yeah i don't

2205.04 --> 2210.0
think it's open anymore

2207.52 --> 2212.4
although who knows maybe with the

2210.0 --> 2214.24
loosening up of the lockdown corona

2212.4 --> 2216.7200000000003
nonsense that maybe

2214.24 --> 2219.1189999999997
maybe it's already open again i should

2216.72 --> 2221.52
like check the internet

2219.119 --> 2221.52
for it

2224.72 --> 2232.8799999999997
buy a bike cars i already got a bike

2229.839 --> 2238.0
dude you think i'm gonna walk

2232.88 --> 2238.0
i'm dutch we got bikes

2240.839 --> 2245.2799999999997
everywhere

2242.8 --> 2245.28
anyway

2255.28 --> 2260.7200000000003
i really hope the address is right i

2258.4 --> 2262.88
really hope

2260.72 --> 2265.2799999999997
it is yeah it is six seconds yeah i

2262.88 --> 2265.28
don't know

2265.76 --> 2271.8390000000004
does anybody know how long the

2268.8 --> 2271.8390000000004
if there is a delay

2272.16 --> 2275.44
these sort of things because i haven't i

2274.64 --> 2285.839
don't see

2317.76 --> 2322.079
right and i am up with that

2319.28 --> 2324.48
i can do something with it i prefer

2322.079 --> 2327.3590000000004
paypal

2324.48 --> 2330.64
but uh yeah no it's not a big loss i'm

2327.359 --> 2330.64
still doing great right

2333.119 --> 2338.88
i've had like very generous donations

2336.32 --> 2338.88
last week

2339.44 --> 2342.88
last week uh last month

2342.96 --> 2347.76
was it again that guy that's awesome and

2346.16 --> 2351.52
even from you guys

2347.76 --> 2351.5200000000004
in the show in the last week as well

2352.32 --> 2355.839
i'm doing just fine

2358.32 --> 2361.839
and this time i'm trying to yeah not

2360.72 --> 2364.24
just

2361.839 --> 2364.96
run through it like oh finally i can

2364.24 --> 2368.16
breathe no

2364.96 --> 2371.28
no no no

2368.16 --> 2373.44
like i'm sick of poverty so i'm going to

2371.28 --> 2383.8390000000004
make the best of this

2373.44 --> 2383.839
for real

2394.839 --> 2397.839
hmm

2398.05 --> 2401.1490000000003
[Music]

2406.48 --> 2411.04
right but i'll bet by the way this that

2409.76 --> 2414.8
douchebag

2411.04 --> 2417.839
he would probably donate

2414.8 --> 2420.8
that sort of thing to like e

2417.839 --> 2420.7999999999997
girls and [ __ ]

2421.52 --> 2425.839
it's like no you're you're a guy

2426.8 --> 2430.96
no you're supposed to be a girl that's

2428.88 --> 2433.28
just all [ __ ]

2430.96 --> 2435.599
then you're gonna get my money one of

2433.28 --> 2435.599
those

2436.0 --> 2440.24
the meek will inherit the earth

2445.2 --> 2448.7999999999997
right but what does that even mean you

2447.599 --> 2453.839
know there's many

2448.8 --> 2453.8390000000004
different ways you can read that

2453.92 --> 2457.119
it's like the earth

2458.88 --> 2465.839
does that include the earthly

2463.119 --> 2466.8
is it basically saying the weak will

2465.839 --> 2469.44
inherent

2466.8 --> 2471.76
the earthly they will be dragged down

2469.44 --> 2471.76
into

2472.64 --> 2481.839
earthly seduction and power because

2475.599 --> 2481.839
that's true

2495.839 --> 2508.88
all right tony whitcomb yeah yeah

2498.48 --> 2511.119
yesterday was pretty good

2508.88 --> 2512.2400000000002
hey and i'm not the only one by the way

2511.119 --> 2516.079
holy [ __ ]

2512.24 --> 2519.2799999999997
own benjamin he did a piece

2516.079 --> 2522.88
like of rudolf steiner and he's found

2519.28 --> 2526.0
like a weird spot that i it that has

2522.88 --> 2529.599
like seriously i had blanked it

2526.0 --> 2530.8
out of my mind so much that as he laid

2529.599 --> 2534.2400000000002
that on the table

2530.8 --> 2538.4
it was like really shocking

2534.24 --> 2538.3999999999996
because i went to a waldorf school

2538.64 --> 2547.68
and i met people there that were

2543.04 --> 2550.8
well racist in that specific way

2547.68 --> 2553.52
like in a in a weird way

2550.8 --> 2554.6400000000003
in a weird righteous way it's very weird

2553.52 --> 2559.2
to even think that

2554.64 --> 2563.04
that's possible and

2559.2 --> 2565.4399999999996
i did learn a lot in that school but it

2563.04 --> 2567.359
also freaked me out in many ways

2565.44 --> 2569.599
and they did kind of make me feel like i

2567.359 --> 2572.56
was a half breed or something

2569.599 --> 2573.599
serious like they bullied me with that

2572.56 --> 2576.16
sometimes

2573.599 --> 2579.839
when i felt like really shitty and got

2576.16 --> 2579.839
all devious

2585.839 --> 2591.119
but it is a fascinating concept

2589.04 --> 2593.7599999999998
that wrote it's like really weird in

2591.119 --> 2595.92
between all of it that will steiner

2593.76 --> 2597.5200000000004
was hanging on to that i i have been

2595.92 --> 2599.52
puzzling out like

2597.52 --> 2601.599
in my mind in response to owen

2599.52 --> 2604.96
benjamin's stream about it

2601.599 --> 2608.48
like why and then the

2604.96 --> 2608.48
era of what it was

2609.68 --> 2615.2
and it is really like pre-hitlerian and

2612.8 --> 2616.079
owen benjamin also highlighted that like

2615.2 --> 2618.3999999999996
how hitler

2616.079 --> 2620.319
really was like the ultimate grabbler of

2618.4 --> 2621.6800000000003
the germans like the germans were doing

2620.319 --> 2623.839
great

2621.68 --> 2635.839
and then he had to come in and basically

2623.839 --> 2635.839
give it all a bad name and ruin it

2646.56 --> 2651.04
we all going through the mental

2648.24 --> 2651.04
idiocracy

2654.079 --> 2663.8390000000004
you mean the the the mental liberation

2657.52 --> 2663.839
the liberation from sanity yeah

2667.92 --> 2671.119
we're all being confronted with it you

2670.56 --> 2673.52
know

2671.119 --> 2675.28
all the people coming running up to you

2673.52 --> 2677.68
really happy

2675.28 --> 2679.28
oh i'm getting my vaccine yeah that that

2677.68 --> 2682.319
nightmare

2679.28 --> 2684.6400000000003
event that's probably happened to every

2682.319 --> 2686.319
single person you've ever spoken to by

2684.64 --> 2689.44
now

2686.319 --> 2692.16
everybody will have had somebody

2689.44 --> 2692.8
that would like come up to them with

2692.16 --> 2696.24
great

2692.8 --> 2698.88
friend based feelings and anticipation

2696.24 --> 2701.1189999999997
and tell them oh i'm gonna get my facts

2698.88 --> 2703.92
oh i'm so happy or i just got it

2701.119 --> 2707.28
yeah that shit's gonna happen to every

2703.92 --> 2719.44
single person you ever spoke to

2707.28 --> 2722.2400000000002
it's crazy

2719.44 --> 2723.92
the germans were not doing great why did

2722.24 --> 2733.839
he say that

2723.92 --> 2733.839
wait what who said what here we go again

2741.599 --> 2746.2400000000002
no but they were not great in the sense

2744.079 --> 2750.6400000000003
that they were prone to

2746.24 --> 2753.4399999999996
influence they were too

2750.64 --> 2753.44
too gullible

2754.24 --> 2759.04
and they had been basically traumatized

2757.68 --> 2761.359
programmed and [ __ ]

2759.04 --> 2763.2
right they were being ex before hitler

2761.359 --> 2768.4
came to power they were

2763.2 --> 2772.319
being subjected to heavy subversion

2768.4 --> 2776.4
and like forced porn and [ __ ] like even

2772.319 --> 2776.4
on kids and just terrible stuff

2776.48 --> 2784.319
sounds kind of familiar modern day right

2780.96 --> 2784.319
and so they were weakened

2785.04 --> 2789.68
but overall they had been very strong

2787.44 --> 2792.319
and resourceful

2789.68 --> 2792.319
right so

2794.88 --> 2798.7200000000003
right exactly the treaty of versailles

2797.44 --> 2801.599
on one hand and

2798.72 --> 2803.5989999999997
yeah and there was it's in a time when

2801.599 --> 2804.88
there was communist revolutions

2803.599 --> 2807.119
happening

2804.88 --> 2807.119
right

2808.24 --> 2812.0789999999997
and that's not just a country next to

2810.72 --> 2816.56
you like

2812.079 --> 2820.0
no that means people in start to

2816.56 --> 2822.88
like crawl into government

2820.0 --> 2824.48
and and subject the people to yeah to

2822.88 --> 2828.1600000000003
this in to the insanity

2824.48 --> 2831.2
to to demoralize them

2828.16 --> 2834.72
and mentally [ __ ] them and they're

2831.2 --> 2834.72
worth being subjected to that

2842.839 --> 2845.839
right

2858.72 --> 2864.24
right but what own benjamin emphasized

2860.96 --> 2868.96
and i really do agree with that

2864.24 --> 2873.2
is that hitler really kind of like

2868.96 --> 2876.88
took the glory of the german people

2873.2 --> 2881.4399999999996
that were rising out of it

2876.88 --> 2886.48
like he took credit for that

2881.44 --> 2889.04
he projected the glory onto himself

2886.48 --> 2892.0
right he tried to steal the credit and

2889.04 --> 2894.16
then he ruined a lot

2892.0 --> 2895.52
in many ways he basically started

2894.16 --> 2901.839
grappling

2895.52 --> 2901.839
the situation

2905.52 --> 2909.599
and yeah it's just really twisted the

2908.48 --> 2912.64
picture that's

2909.599 --> 2914.0
has eventually been woven out of it for

2912.64 --> 2917.52
the media

2914.0 --> 2920.72
because they really do kind of glorify

2917.52 --> 2921.839
hitler like they make him look in in a

2920.72 --> 2924.3999999999996
context

2921.839 --> 2926.839
where he is like oh he's the one that

2924.4 --> 2929.6800000000003
assembled all of that

2926.839 --> 2931.44
right they don't tell you

2929.68 --> 2933.839
exactly the background of the german

2931.44 --> 2933.839
people

2934.16 --> 2937.52
and that it's really them that got out

2936.16 --> 2939.68
of it and he

2937.52 --> 2941.68
kind of was more like a parasite in

2939.68 --> 2943.52
government hey well that should sound

2941.68 --> 2946.48
familiar because that happens throughout

2943.52 --> 2946.48
history all the time

2954.16 --> 2959.2
right and he used the momentum of the

2957.2 --> 2961.68
ascension

2959.2 --> 2963.7599999999998
of the german people who just got out of

2961.68 --> 2967.1189999999997
all the psychological

2963.76 --> 2970.1600000000003
attacks he used that

2967.119 --> 2973.839
momentum and then

2970.16 --> 2978.16
put rains on the german people

2973.839 --> 2978.16
like he you would tame an animal

2979.119 --> 2982.079
and they just took it

2982.96 --> 2998.16
and then yeah then [ __ ] really started

2985.44 --> 3002.079
to go down

2998.16 --> 3002.0789999999997
right and he was mad that's right

3004.24 --> 3009.5989999999997
there was no long-term balance there was

3007.92 --> 3013.2000000000003
no consideration for

3009.599 --> 3014.559
end results right he just wanted to win

3013.2 --> 3016.5589999999997
win win win win he

3014.559 --> 3017.8390000000004
he didn't even really think too much

3016.559 --> 3020.7200000000003
about

3017.839 --> 3022.4
everything that would come afterward the

3020.72 --> 3025.2799999999997
aftermath

3022.4 --> 3026.319
he didn't really care about it at all

3025.28 --> 3029.8390000000004
i've never seen

3026.319 --> 3030.48
him in a way that he showed that he

3029.839 --> 3034.4
actually

3030.48 --> 3038.72
cared he just

3034.4 --> 3038.7200000000003
was somebody that's like obsessed with

3038.839 --> 3041.839
winning

3046.079 --> 3051.28
what credit did hitler steal well

3052.0 --> 3055.76
credit steve well not literally credit

3054.8 --> 3059.52
stealing

3055.76 --> 3059.5200000000004
or maybe in a way he just

3062.48 --> 3067.119
he wasn't really part of the german

3065.76 --> 3071.28
revolution

3067.119 --> 3071.28
he wasn't even really a german

3071.52 --> 3083.839
right was an outsider

3092.88 --> 3096.2400000000002
and right when i say he stole the credit

3095.44 --> 3099.52
well that's

3096.24 --> 3102.64
in in afterward in history and how we

3099.52 --> 3105.92
get to see about him in in media now

3102.64 --> 3109.2799999999997
he has been kind of pedestal as like a

3105.92 --> 3112.88
terrible dangerous scary figure

3109.28 --> 3113.52
that that made the german people rose up

3112.88 --> 3116.079
in this

3113.52 --> 3117.119
autocratic madness that's kind of the

3116.079 --> 3120.8
image

3117.119 --> 3120.8
they give you like he did that

3121.599 --> 3127.6800000000003
but he was really practically more

3124.64 --> 3131.04
like a megalomaniacal grabbler

3127.68 --> 3131.9199999999996
that just used the ascension of the

3131.04 --> 3135.359
german people

3131.92 --> 3135.359
getting out of a tight spot

3136.8 --> 3142.48
right they don't put the image of him

3140.4 --> 3143.92
and everything in the history down like

3142.48 --> 3147.68
that

3143.92 --> 3148.2400000000002
in media right they don't want to tell

3147.68 --> 3151.2
you about

3148.24 --> 3153.2
gravelers in governments doing that they

3151.2 --> 3155.7599999999998
don't want to give you the idea that

3153.2 --> 3158.64
that's actually historical

3155.76 --> 3160.4
because history repeats itself and they

3158.64 --> 3163.7599999999998
don't want you to know about it

3160.4 --> 3167.2000000000003
because they do that now

3163.76 --> 3167.6800000000003
all over the place right it's even kind

3167.2 --> 3169.839
of

3167.68 --> 3171.68
blatantly obvious like certain

3169.839 --> 3173.599
governments like the people doing their

3171.68 --> 3174.319
what they do with the corona policy

3173.599 --> 3177.52
alone

3174.319 --> 3180.48
on lockdowns and just it's like yeah

3177.52 --> 3181.52
you're a freaking grappler it's like no

3180.48 --> 3186.16
mistake about it

3181.52 --> 3186.16
and you gotta be ignorant not to see it

3189.68 --> 3194.8799999999997
right and then hey if we if this just

3191.839 --> 3197.359
keeps on going on

3194.88 --> 3199.839
then maybe if these people are still in

3197.359 --> 3201.92
control of media then in 20 years it

3199.839 --> 3204.0789999999997
would be told like these

3201.92 --> 3205.599
grab their people upholding their corona

3204.079 --> 3208.1600000000003
narrative

3205.599 --> 3210.559
like they were all the front men and

3208.16 --> 3213.68
they were actually trying to

3210.559 --> 3218.0
warn the people of a catastrophe they

3213.68 --> 3218.0
did their best to keep it all together

3218.079 --> 3221.6800000000003
right they'll do the same thing over

3220.319 --> 3223.2799999999997
again

3221.68 --> 3224.96
they do the same thing they did with

3223.28 --> 3226.88
hitler not making

3224.96 --> 3229.44
these people into boogeyman bro they

3226.88 --> 3232.079
will won't do that maybe they'll pin

3229.44 --> 3233.04
like transhumanism on them or something

3232.079 --> 3236.079
it's

3233.04 --> 3239.119
but they will rearrange the things

3236.079 --> 3242.319
of the key players to make it look like

3239.119 --> 3245.28
they were the ones doing it that they

3242.319 --> 3247.04
were controlling the people making the

3245.28 --> 3249.8390000000004
people do things

3247.04 --> 3251.599
right that's the image that through

3249.839 --> 3254.88
media

3251.599 --> 3258.7200000000003
they want you to think they want you to

3254.88 --> 3258.7200000000003
think that they were always in control

3259.04 --> 3266.88
right it's part of the hypnotism

3262.16 --> 3270.8799999999997
long-term hypnotism through media

3266.88 --> 3270.88
this is how they want you to see history

3276.839 --> 3279.839
anyway

3284.799 --> 3293.839
all right

3318.839 --> 3321.839
hmm

3329.04 --> 3335.839
sun is no longer hitting the wall

3374.839 --> 3377.839
so

3389.92 --> 3394.319
right so yeah

3395.44 --> 3404.7200000000003
home benjamin definitely

3398.64 --> 3407.359
got me thinking with that show

3404.72 --> 3408.8799999999997
and yeah thinking way back because i

3407.359 --> 3410.5589999999997
went to a waltop school

3408.88 --> 3412.48
i didn't even know it was called a walt

3410.559 --> 3413.88
dorf so i just thought it was like no

3412.48 --> 3416.48
it's a

3413.88 --> 3416.88
anthroposophic school rudolf steiner

3416.48 --> 3418.4
base

3416.88 --> 3420.559
i didn't know they would call it

3418.4 --> 3424.319
waltarf's tools

3420.559 --> 3424.3190000000004
right so apparently that's what it's

3427.4 --> 3430.51
[Music]

3430.839 --> 3433.839
called

3450.319 --> 3461.839
all right

3475.76 --> 3481.28
right tony whitcomb well it can't take

3478.72 --> 3481.2799999999997
very long

3483.2 --> 3489.839
like it's there's gonna be a suggestion

3485.2 --> 3489.839
that it's just gonna keep on going

3490.0 --> 3494.319
but in reality they've already like kind

3492.48 --> 3496.96
of clamped it all up

3494.319 --> 3499.68
making the output overkill right so it's

3496.96 --> 3502.319
like the death blossom effect it's like

3499.68 --> 3504.0789999999997
the game is ending so they're rushing it

3502.319 --> 3506.319
out

3504.079 --> 3506.319
right

3508.96 --> 3520.0
no room was there a disgrace

3516.72 --> 3522.48
well it was grabbled of course in its

3520.0 --> 3522.48
own way

3523.359 --> 3527.2
and that's probably gonna happen again

3525.52 --> 3530.4
to some degree

3527.2 --> 3532.64
right we people

3530.4 --> 3534.0
that they will simply use everything

3532.64 --> 3536.16
that's happened right now

3534.0 --> 3538.48
more as a blackmailing tool keeping them

3536.16 --> 3540.72
alive for a specific function and others

3538.48 --> 3545.839
they are going to go down

3540.72 --> 3545.839
that's how it typically happens

3547.04 --> 3550.96
right so they got like this oh yeah

3548.96 --> 3552.96
you're actually a war criminal card but

3550.96 --> 3553.68
we'll keep it a secret as long as you do

3552.96 --> 3558.2400000000002
what we say

3553.68 --> 3560.0
right it's that's

3558.24 --> 3561.7599999999998
kind of what happened with the german

3560.0 --> 3565.76
scientists that went to

3561.76 --> 3568.1600000000003
uh to nasa

3565.76 --> 3573.8390000000004
and that's similar things are probably

3568.16 --> 3573.839
gonna happen again

3577.599 --> 3582.799
tony wickham

3585.599 --> 3590.0
just say tony wickham okay okay

3597.52 --> 3602.079
you want me to say tony wickham not

3599.76 --> 3605.28
whitcomb

3602.079 --> 3606.7200000000003
but that's how i read that so i don't

3605.28 --> 3609.6800000000003
know

3606.72 --> 3615.839
i don't know really how to pronounce it

3609.68 --> 3615.839
sure wickham that seems very familiar

3630.319 --> 3635.48
i'll try to remember it

3632.41 --> 3635.48
[Music]

3640.4 --> 3645.599
right but yeah good point erica

3643.68 --> 3646.799
apple revolution is what they want to

3645.599 --> 3649.44
order out of chaos

3646.799 --> 3649.44
it's a game

3650.0 --> 3654.4
well if corona [ __ ] happens

3654.839 --> 3661.44
stops it's simply

3658.4 --> 3662.079
a sign that we're done with this part of

3661.44 --> 3664.16
the game

3662.079 --> 3666.319
but it's just one part of the game it's

3664.16 --> 3670.0
just gonna move on

3666.319 --> 3670.5589999999997
to the next scene right and that next

3670.0 --> 3673.28
scene

3670.559 --> 3673.28
is gonna be

3674.16 --> 3681.2799999999997
yeah then it has been going for a while

3678.0 --> 3685.2
right first there was the

3681.28 --> 3688.7200000000003
economic war

3685.2 --> 3688.72
now propaganda war

3688.96 --> 3694.319
between america and china

3692.319 --> 3696.16
and it's going to go all over the world

3694.319 --> 3698.48
and everybody's going to be

3696.16 --> 3700.799
pulled and pushed to take a side and

3698.48 --> 3700.799
[ __ ]

3701.04 --> 3713.839
that's what i predict is gonna happen

3715.359 --> 3720.0
and i wonder if there's ever going to be

3717.2 --> 3722.8799999999997
any real hot war

3720.0 --> 3722.88
like yeah sure

3724.559 --> 3728.2400000000002
like not in a prolonged way that

3726.64 --> 3731.2799999999997
everything's gonna blow up

3728.24 --> 3735.52
i i predict against that

3731.28 --> 3735.52
and i think that's extremely unlikely

3737.599 --> 3742.079
it's not gonna blow up the world but it

3740.799 --> 3744.559
will be just like

3742.079 --> 3746.7200000000003
war time again and that you know and

3744.559 --> 3748.96
then when it happens

3746.72 --> 3750.9599999999996
all kinds of players around the world in

3748.96 --> 3754.7200000000003
their situations all start to make their

3750.96 --> 3756.64
moves right it always happens like that

3754.72 --> 3758.799
every party is going to make their move

3756.64 --> 3761.1189999999997
because yeah the others are going to be

3758.799 --> 3764.559
preoccupied so nobody's going to

3761.119 --> 3766.4
get right on their ass because everybody

3764.559 --> 3770.6400000000003
else out there is making their move

3766.4 --> 3770.64
right let's cut how it works

3772.4 --> 3775.6800000000003
so it's just going to be the next part

3773.92 --> 3777.52
of the game and then

3775.68 --> 3780.0789999999997
america is going to blame china and then

3777.52 --> 3782.4
china is going to blame america

3780.079 --> 3783.599
and then they're just going to be like

3782.4 --> 3788.1600000000003
media

3783.599 --> 3790.6800000000003
war between them endless stories endless

3788.16 --> 3793.2799999999997
accusations endless details

3790.68 --> 3795.7599999999998
declassifications blah blah blah and a

3793.28 --> 3799.44
lot of it is just going to be pure

3795.76 --> 3802.559
[ __ ] but it will eventually

3799.44 --> 3804.559
sound kind of convincing

3802.559 --> 3806.4
right that's what i this is my

3804.559 --> 3808.88
prediction i wonder how

3806.4 --> 3812.319
correct i am i might be completely off

3808.88 --> 3812.319
but i think that this will happen

3812.559 --> 3816.7200000000003
it's already happening a little

3817.359 --> 3823.0389999999998
but it will heat up and maybe some

3820.96 --> 3824.4
like grandstanding or something like

3823.039 --> 3826.4
they will send us

3824.4 --> 3827.839
a fleet of ships here and there to be

3826.4 --> 3830.2400000000002
just like we're here what you're going

3827.839 --> 3833.68
to do about it that that sort of thing

3830.24 --> 3836.16
making everybody nervous of course

3833.68 --> 3836.96
demonstrations of military equipment

3836.16 --> 3839.44
like ooh look

3836.96 --> 3842.7200000000003
what we can do we can shoot your rockets

3839.44 --> 3846.0
right out of the sky with these

3842.72 --> 3849.9199999999996
with this new missile defense system

3846.0 --> 3853.839
or something lasers

3849.92 --> 3853.839
right a lot of that

3857.68 --> 3867.359
so maybe more a cold war really hot

3861.44 --> 3870.16
on the media emphasis on media

3867.359 --> 3870.72
and probably a whole [ __ ] bag of false

3870.16 --> 3873.68
flags

3870.72 --> 3874.5589999999997
events like things that like literally

3873.68 --> 3880.799
don't happen

3874.559 --> 3884.6400000000003
at all oh my god this blew up

3880.799 --> 3887.2
and then it didn't actually blow up

3884.64 --> 3887.68
but it's classified like that's i don't

3887.2 --> 3890.0
know

3887.68 --> 3891.0389999999998
maybe that's one step too far it's just

3890.0 --> 3895.039
that

3891.039 --> 3896.96
dude all the same players are still

3895.039 --> 3899.119
going to be in the fields

3896.96 --> 3900.2400000000002
yeah a couple of big ones are going to

3899.119 --> 3903.92
be taken

3900.24 --> 3903.9199999999996
down with the corona [ __ ]

3904.0 --> 3907.92
when that goes down but still there's

3906.48 --> 3909.599
going to be all these players that

3907.92 --> 3910.96
have been doing all their things are

3909.599 --> 3912.88
still going to be in the field and they

3910.96 --> 3913.44
are going to find a new purpose for

3912.88 --> 3915.839
theirs

3913.44 --> 3917.839
for their application and there's going

3915.839 --> 3921.0389999999998
to be crisis actors again

3917.839 --> 3922.96
and everything that you're familiar with

3921.039 --> 3926.0
is going to be presented in a new

3922.96 --> 3929.039
context right

3926.0 --> 3929.039
that's my prediction

3930.88 --> 3935.6800000000003
yeah iran indeed iran is

3934.16 --> 3937.2799999999997
there's something going to happen

3935.68 --> 3939.68
eventually with that but that might take

3937.28 --> 3942.88
a long time

3939.68 --> 3942.8799999999997
north korea too

3944.559 --> 3951.8390000000004
first it's going to be china

3957.28 --> 3965.8390000000004
alien false flag isn't working

3966.0 --> 3971.92
well you know what cargo apple

3969.52 --> 3972.64
alien false flag in the workings or if

3971.92 --> 3974.96
you mean

3972.64 --> 3975.7599999999998
they're working out a good script book

3974.96 --> 3978.96
for it

3975.76 --> 3984.7200000000003
sure does that mean they are about to

3978.96 --> 3984.7200000000003
unfold it completely i don't think so

3984.96 --> 3992.64
i think that plans

3988.799 --> 3993.0389999999998
like massive events that are like stage

3992.64 --> 3996.24
play

3993.039 --> 3996.7200000000003
meant for the entire world that they

3996.24 --> 3999.839
only

3996.72 --> 4000.3999999999996
really unfold those and all the parties

3999.839 --> 4002.48
agree

4000.4 --> 4005.039
and work along with it kind of like they

4002.48 --> 4006.799
have with the iss

4005.039 --> 4010.1600000000003
right and then you have to stick to it

4006.799 --> 4013.52
even in war and everything

4010.16 --> 4014.5589999999997
so an alien invasion is not going to

4013.52 --> 4017.599
work if it's like

4014.559 --> 4017.8390000000004
only the u.s is going to do it because

4017.599 --> 4019.599
if

4017.839 --> 4021.92
china for example doesn't agree they're

4019.599 --> 4024.4
just gonna say oh look america no they

4021.92 --> 4028.4
they play foolie game

4024.4 --> 4031.6800000000003
on their stupid americans again

4028.4 --> 4033.76
however yeah like moon landing right

4031.68 --> 4036.0
they're just gonna go straight in like

4033.76 --> 4036.2400000000002
oh screw you huh you're trying to fool

4036.0 --> 4038.64
us

4036.24 --> 4040.3999999999996
breaking the entire spill so they can

4038.64 --> 4043.5989999999997
only really do

4040.4 --> 4044.64
something like that when everybody

4043.599 --> 4046.839
agrees

4044.64 --> 4048.24
when there has been that moment when you

4046.839 --> 4050.0789999999997
see

4048.24 --> 4052.3999999999996
presidents get together and all shake

4050.079 --> 4053.52
hands right that's the moment when you

4052.4 --> 4055.76
could consider okay

4053.52 --> 4056.72
they might do something like that

4055.76 --> 4058.96
because if

4056.72 --> 4061.4399999999996
there is like a serious conflict between

4058.96 --> 4064.0
parties and one doesn't work alone

4061.44 --> 4066.2400000000002
then they'll probably end up ruining the

4064.0 --> 4069.2
spell

4066.24 --> 4071.7599999999998
to to get even with their opponent their

4069.2 --> 4074.839
perceived opponent right see

4071.76 --> 4077.119
so think about that when you say these

4074.839 --> 4080.799
things alien false flag

4077.119 --> 4083.599
right alien false flag probably requires

4080.799 --> 4091.839
all governments to cooperate just like

4083.599 --> 4091.839
with the iss

4098.88 --> 4105.839
but ufos are kind of interesting though

4101.12 --> 4105.839
bkk dave

4106.159 --> 4112.239
they they are a lot of them are ufos

4110.4 --> 4113.839
you remember what that actually means an

4112.239 --> 4116.959999999999
unidentified flying

4113.839 --> 4118.44
object though the word object may be a

4116.96 --> 4120.4800000000005
little bit

4118.44 --> 4122.719
presuppositional you don't necessarily

4120.48 --> 4122.718999999999
know

4122.799 --> 4129.5199999999995
more like a ufp an identified flying

4126.799 --> 4129.5199999999995
phenomenon

4129.92 --> 4133.839
right because are they always objects

4135.44 --> 4139.919999999999
or could it be like uh yeah another

4138.48 --> 4143.759
celestial light

4139.92 --> 4145.92
thing that's just weird

4143.759 --> 4147.359
for some reason it might be spiking up

4145.92 --> 4149.52
again like oh now there's

4147.359 --> 4151.679
more of this gonna happen but hey there

4149.52 --> 4154.799000000001
might be actual flying objects

4151.679 --> 4158.2390000000005
i've seen like video footage of

4154.799 --> 4158.239
like metal spheres

4159.6 --> 4163.839
that there would be a proximity change

4162.0 --> 4164.719
to the camera like getting closer and

4163.839 --> 4167.5199999999995
you could even see

4164.719 --> 4168.4800000000005
like that's not a perfect sphere and

4167.52 --> 4172.839000000001
there's actually

4168.48 --> 4175.3589999999995
like you can see like a machine line or

4172.839 --> 4178.159
assemble a compartment

4175.359 --> 4180.319
like a little line a groove in it so

4178.159 --> 4183.599999999999
that seems like that's a physical object

4180.319 --> 4183.6
absolutely that was made

4183.759 --> 4188.48
probably military or something super

4186.719 --> 4192.88
deep state blah blah i don't know

4188.48 --> 4192.879999999999
you know so it there's curiosities

4193.12 --> 4199.84
it is interesting doesn't mean aliens

4196.48 --> 4202.5599999999995
it means high tech and weird

4199.84 --> 4203.84
celestial effects it's like high-tech

4202.56 --> 4208.719
and holographics

4203.84 --> 4208.719
pretty much that's what they are

4209.92 --> 4217.84
it's not visitors from another planet

4230.56 --> 4235.52
you wish you didn't believe ufos seen a

4233.199 --> 4235.5199999999995
few

4237.84 --> 4244.0
just consider what you saw

4241.6 --> 4244.64
think about it carefully don't get drawn

4244.0 --> 4247.679
into

4244.64 --> 4251.12
standard presuppositions

4247.679 --> 4251.52
right when you think a ufo don't think

4251.12 --> 4255.76
oh

4251.52 --> 4258.8
aliens in a tin can right

4255.76 --> 4260.159000000001
that's programming this that's

4258.8 --> 4262.719
suggestive programming

4260.159 --> 4263.92
that makes you start out thinking like

4262.719 --> 4267.04
that

4263.92 --> 4268.4
why are you assuming it has to be that

4267.04 --> 4270.239
why don't you just take it

4268.4 --> 4273.759999999999
scientifically and see hey this is

4270.239 --> 4275.759999999999
a phenomenon visual right so can we

4273.76 --> 4278.4800000000005
confirm things beyond visual

4275.76 --> 4279.84
well you might be depending on the

4278.48 --> 4282.4
phenomenon

4279.84 --> 4286.0
is it just a light up there or are you

4282.4 --> 4288.32
actually seeing

4286.0 --> 4290.48
light being blotted out sign of

4288.32 --> 4293.759999999999
physicality

4290.48 --> 4295.919999999999
right is there proximity changes

4293.76 --> 4297.280000000001
that you can see oh it's coming closer

4295.92 --> 4299.28
it's becoming angular

4297.28 --> 4301.599999999999
its angular size is bigger perspective

4299.28 --> 4303.199
so it is really a physical thing then

4301.6 --> 4305.76
right those are the things you got to

4303.199 --> 4308.48
look out for it's the same

4305.76 --> 4309.6
it's everything flat earth and

4308.48 --> 4310.879999999999
celestials

4309.6 --> 4314.08
it's the same thing you got to be

4310.88 --> 4316.96
scientific about it you got to be honest

4314.08 --> 4317.36
spot early presuppositions when they

4316.96 --> 4319.76
slip

4317.36 --> 4322.239
in and discard them and just give an

4319.76 --> 4322.2390000000005
honest

4326.84 --> 4329.84
analysis

4337.679 --> 4342.4
could ufos be coming from beyond the

4340.159 --> 4345.92
eyes wow

4342.4 --> 4348.4
uh no

4345.92 --> 4351.76
i don't think so i don't think they're

4348.4 --> 4355.12
coming from there might be

4351.76 --> 4356.08
ufo like crap there might be bells as i

4355.12 --> 4358.08
like to call the

4356.08 --> 4360.48
bell craft there might be some bell

4358.08 --> 4363.679
craft there

4360.48 --> 4364.48
but they're not coming over to here i

4363.679 --> 4369.36
think

4364.48 --> 4371.759999999999
like they just keep to themselves

4369.36 --> 4372.799999999999
now whatever is flying over here

4371.76 --> 4376.0
metallic-wise

4372.8 --> 4379.76
is probably secret government project

4376.0 --> 4382.159
testing technology mostly just like

4379.76 --> 4382.159000000001
drone

4382.84 --> 4385.84
based

4390.719 --> 4399.84
ah get out of here

4400.0 --> 4403.92
shouldn't we be able to see more land

4402.0 --> 4406.48
from that height

4403.92 --> 4406.4800000000005
what height

4408.32 --> 4412.88
right uh no no duff

4413.52 --> 4416.88
because you still have to look through

4416.32 --> 4420.4
all that

4416.88 --> 4422.56
air and so eventually

4420.4 --> 4423.92
the preponderance of it will simply make

4422.56 --> 4427.04
it impossible to see

4423.92 --> 4429.4400000000005
anything beyond a certain circle circle

4427.04 --> 4431.92
of view

4429.44 --> 4433.12
you don't have unlimited reach with your

4431.92 --> 4435.36
sight

4433.12 --> 4437.36
unless you would be literally looking

4435.36 --> 4443.12
through pressureless

4437.36 --> 4443.12
volume through vacuum and it's not there

4452.08 --> 4455.36
we do see more land well you see we'll

4454.64 --> 4459.4400000000005
you'll see

4455.36 --> 4460.0
some more because yeah higher up there's

4459.44 --> 4464.4
less

4460.0 --> 4464.4
air to look through horizontally

4465.199 --> 4471.36
so the circle view will widen up

4469.6 --> 4473.4400000000005
but at some point doesn't matter how

4471.36 --> 4483.839999999999
high up you go it's not going to grow

4473.44 --> 4483.839999999999
any bigger

4490.719 --> 4494.4
okay slow mo moon buggy

4495.28 --> 4503.199
it's not very revealing

4500.08 --> 4511.84
you had an amazing experience

4503.199 --> 4511.839999999999
and it was heavy okay

4542.8 --> 4547.6
high altitude balloon cam close to

4545.6 --> 4551.120000000001
antarctica would be interesting

4547.6 --> 4553.280000000001
well yeah bkk dave although you know

4551.12 --> 4555.5199999999995
how well we'll be able to handle that

4553.28 --> 4558.639999999999
sort of temperature

4555.52 --> 4558.64
that's an issue too

4558.96 --> 4565.76
right rubber

4562.08 --> 4567.44
even good rubber does get vulnerable to

4565.76 --> 4569.679
cold

4567.44 --> 4571.678999999999
it does it gets brittle right this is

4569.679 --> 4574.08
also the reason why balloons

4571.679 --> 4575.4400000000005
snap way up there it's because the

4574.08 --> 4581.28
pressure is increasing

4575.44 --> 4584.08
and it's getting colder

4581.28 --> 4585.759999999999
so eventually the the force from the

4584.08 --> 4590.88
pressure within

4585.76 --> 4590.88
versus the structural strength

4591.36 --> 4595.44
it becomes too much for the balloon and

4593.36 --> 4598.48
then it just breaks

4595.44 --> 4601.199
snaps so

4598.48 --> 4603.12
yeah in at antarctica it's going to be

4601.199 --> 4605.04
even colder so

4603.12 --> 4609.84
i don't know how high up the balloon

4605.04 --> 4609.84
would make it

4616.48 --> 4620.239
i don't know maybe there's no problem

4618.0 --> 4623.84
with it at all maybe it would just go up

4620.239 --> 4623.839999999999
very high i don't know

4645.679 --> 4653.04
right well you know what bkk

4649.12 --> 4655.5199999999995
dave who knows

4653.04 --> 4656.4
like that supposed first picture of

4655.52 --> 4659.4400000000005
earth right

4656.4 --> 4659.92
of antarctica it's a photograph well

4659.44 --> 4665.839999999999
maybe

4659.92 --> 4665.84
it was actually taken with the balloon

4668.56 --> 4679.84
maybe they did let it up at antarctica

4681.12 --> 4687.28
or at least yeah at that region at that

4685.04 --> 4687.28
lev

4690.56 --> 4693.92
is it long that i can always mix them on

4692.719 --> 4707.84
the longitude like

4693.92 --> 4707.84
latitude long long detude

4710.719 --> 4714.08
right latitude

4716.88 --> 4723.84
slatitude longitude is east to west

4720.56 --> 4723.84
latitude north to south

4732.84 --> 4736.88
right

4734.88 --> 4738.400000000001
made of late what's the same thing tiny

4736.88 --> 4742.64
womble

4738.4 --> 4745.679
it's rubber latex is also rubber

4742.64 --> 4750.4800000000005
it's flexible but when you cool it off

4745.679 --> 4755.28
or you ice it up it becomes brittle

4750.48 --> 4755.28
it loses its flexibility and breaks

4760.84 --> 4763.84
easily

4775.679 --> 4791.84
10 miles though

4797.199 --> 4805.839999999999
no naps i mean caps

4816.84 --> 4819.84
so

4828.48 --> 4833.839999999999
right sleeping warrior yeah it does

4851.76 --> 4856.96
but wasn't there like already

4853.76 --> 4856.96
photographs of this

4857.52 --> 4861.52
i remember seeing them go around i don't

4860.0 --> 4863.44
know if

4861.52 --> 4866.4800000000005
how real that was but weren't there

4863.44 --> 4869.28
photographs just like that

4866.48 --> 4869.28
from a balloon

4869.52 --> 4872.88
like into the super far distance and

4872.4 --> 4876.239
that

4872.88 --> 4878.08
yeah it's just on their land

4876.239 --> 4880.159
i remember seeing that photograph i

4878.08 --> 4882.8
should have

4880.159 --> 4886.839999999999
snapshotted it or something i might

4882.8 --> 4889.84
still have it in a pdf somewhere on my

4886.84 --> 4889.84
computer

4891.199 --> 4895.839999999999
i remember having seen a photograph like

4893.6 --> 4895.84
that

4900.719 --> 4906.159
wait wasn't that in the documentary

4906.639 --> 4911.1990000000005
of beelu remember i think it wasn't that

4910.719 --> 4913.84
one

4911.199 --> 4915.5199999999995
that they actually did because they were

4913.84 --> 4918.0
like a convex earth

4915.52 --> 4919.679
and they were all about the other puddle

4918.0 --> 4922.48
i think it was like separate

4919.679 --> 4923.679
and a weird interpretation of the

4922.48 --> 4927.678999999999
cosmogeny

4923.679 --> 4927.679
kind of flattered society but different

4928.32 --> 4936.4
but they had photographs

4931.36 --> 4936.4
apparently somebody went out to get them

4940.88 --> 4945.84
does anybody remember that

4948.08 --> 4959.84
tony i remember that you've seen it do

4951.04 --> 4959.84
you remember that

4970.84 --> 4973.84
okay

4987.76 --> 4993.679
well doc elta you know talking about the

4991.04 --> 4993.679
firmament

4994.0 --> 4998.08
where is it said that the firmament

4995.679 --> 4999.92
touches down

4998.08 --> 5002.239
right i know the firmament is referred

4999.92 --> 5004.88
to in the bible

5002.239 --> 5007.44
and there's many things like

5004.88 --> 5009.52
cosmogonical design elements that

5007.44 --> 5010.5599999999995
are being highlighted in many different

5009.52 --> 5012.88
spots

5010.56 --> 5015.1990000000005
never heard of this firmament touching

5012.88 --> 5017.4400000000005
down though

5015.199 --> 5020.159
right no it's just this thing that

5017.44 --> 5020.159
separates

5020.32 --> 5025.28
so as far as i'm concerned the firmament

5022.4 --> 5025.28
is a flat top

5026.08 --> 5029.12
there's no reference of any touchdown

5028.639 --> 5032.159000000001
point

5029.12 --> 5032.159
for the firmament

5036.239 --> 5039.44
do do you oh do you remember what yeah

5038.56 --> 5043.04
the

5039.44 --> 5046.879999999999
documentary with blue remember

5043.04 --> 5049.679
is it brazilian or argentinian

5046.88 --> 5049.679
argentinian

5051.52 --> 5054.719
where they had the convex earth and they

5054.239 --> 5058.08
also

5054.719 --> 5062.2390000000005
showed this high altitude picture

5058.08 --> 5062.239
that somebody there went and took

5062.88 --> 5069.679
of land into the far distance

5066.4 --> 5070.0
like beyond antarctica you remember

5069.679 --> 5072.56
seeing

5070.0 --> 5073.84
that because a lot of it was kind of

5072.56 --> 5076.88
silly

5073.84 --> 5078.639
but they had that picture in there right

5076.88 --> 5080.8
and i think that that's kind of like the

5078.639 --> 5082.32
trick you show something that's real and

5080.8 --> 5084.08
then you fill it in with a bunch of

5082.32 --> 5086.08
nonsense attention grabbiness and

5084.08 --> 5089.36
misleading things

5086.08 --> 5094.5599999999995
and then you can get away with it

5089.36 --> 5094.5599999999995
right but that picture i remember it

5097.36 --> 5101.12
the red eyed bush buddy yeah yeah

5107.12 --> 5109.44
right

5110.56 --> 5113.76
well it is silly but it is memorable

5113.04 --> 5116.96
though

5113.76 --> 5119.12
right so now because you remember the

5116.96 --> 5121.76
little red-eyed bush alien that told

5119.12 --> 5125.04
them the earth was convex

5121.76 --> 5125.6
on camera notice because you remember

5125.04 --> 5128.719
that

5125.6 --> 5132.159000000001
you might also be able to remember

5128.719 --> 5132.159
that photo they showed

5132.8 --> 5138.320000000001
in the film of the land beyond

5135.92 --> 5140.96
antarctica that led them to believe

5138.32 --> 5142.159
the earth is like toilet shaped or

5140.96 --> 5146.0
whatever

5142.159 --> 5155.839999999999
really weird but that picture they did

5146.0 --> 5155.84
show that

5162.159 --> 5169.12
there's a dome of some sort of ice

5166.08 --> 5172.96
sure well you could say that

5169.12 --> 5172.96
but where's the evidence for it you know

5173.199 --> 5176.719
just because you think it might be

5174.96 --> 5178.719
logical in your mind

5176.719 --> 5182.719
puzzling it together doesn't mean that

5178.719 --> 5187.12
it's actually there

5182.719 --> 5187.12
as far as i'm concerned there is no

5187.28 --> 5193.5199999999995
no wall it's all just looping

5191.36 --> 5197.839999999999
it's much more miraculous and bizarre

5193.52 --> 5197.84
and hard to imagine

5208.96 --> 5213.28
where's the evidence of the ferment it's

5210.639 --> 5213.28
in the bible

5214.239 --> 5225.839999999999
there's mansion

5236.96 --> 5243.199
yeah i got servant but air pressure

5240.32 --> 5245.199
don't know if the firmament is specific

5243.199 --> 5248.5599999999995
to that though

5245.199 --> 5251.199
but it will like if there is a flat top

5248.56 --> 5254.56
it will also be a determining factor for

5251.199 --> 5258.96
for the volume available for gas

5254.56 --> 5258.96
that's right there has to be containment

5259.28 --> 5263.36
and firmament doesn't literally address

5262.08 --> 5266.96
that

5263.36 --> 5269.92
but it's very hard not to basically

5266.96 --> 5272.8
assume that about it

5269.92 --> 5274.8
because we know through physics gas

5272.8 --> 5276.88
pressure requires a container so there

5274.8 --> 5280.0
has to be a containment somehow

5276.88 --> 5283.12
well firmament is described as something

5280.0 --> 5286.239
that it's very easy to imagine could be

5283.12 --> 5291.76
a container factor

5286.239 --> 5291.759999999999
right this is basically all logic based

5292.84 --> 5295.84
speculation

5299.92 --> 5304.0
if it is a flat top what holds it up

5306.84 --> 5311.360000000001
nothing

5308.239 --> 5313.04
it's holding itself up right it could be

5311.36 --> 5315.36
you could look at it in all kinds of

5313.04 --> 5315.36
ways

5315.84 --> 5323.28
what if the flat top is the bottom

5320.08 --> 5326.96
of our realm then what would need

5323.28 --> 5330.639
to hold it up if it is literally

5326.96 --> 5331.76
euclideanly set it's just going to be

5330.639 --> 5336.639
there

5331.76 --> 5339.84
that's how the space is divided

5336.639 --> 5340.4800000000005
right if it's the bottom of the entire

5339.84 --> 5343.84
realm

5340.48 --> 5347.28
all the material that's hanging over us

5343.84 --> 5351.4400000000005
then why would it come closer

5347.28 --> 5353.679
huh yeah it's a little speciality

5351.44 --> 5353.678999999999
and

5361.44 --> 5367.04
and maybe otherwise if it's not

5365.199 --> 5369.36
literally the bottom of the realm that's

5367.04 --> 5371.6
so hanging over us

5369.36 --> 5373.599999999999
then maybe there are pillars or there is

5371.6 --> 5377.6
a singular pillar

5373.6 --> 5380.639
like the legs on a table

5377.6 --> 5384.08
that are holding it up maybe there are

5380.639 --> 5384.08
touchdown points somewhere

5385.36 --> 5388.5599999999995
maybe these touchdown points aren't even

5388.0 --> 5392.8
within

5388.56 --> 5393.280000000001
available space maybe they are outside

5392.8 --> 5395.76
of

5393.28 --> 5396.719
the available loops that we are

5395.76 --> 5399.679
contained in

5396.719 --> 5402.2390000000005
right this is getting kind of science

5399.679 --> 5402.2390000000005
fictiony

5404.08 --> 5421.84
let me try to draw it out

5433.52 --> 5439.679
right so think about it like this

5436.88 --> 5441.52
one square over here i don't know how

5439.679 --> 5444.8
well you can see this i hope

5441.52 --> 5447.4400000000005
good enough let's see stupid

5444.8 --> 5450.4800000000005
youtube delay stop scrolling back my

5447.44 --> 5450.48
video a minute

5451.92 --> 5457.6
okay that's completely not visible that

5454.8 --> 5457.6
sucks uh

5458.32 --> 5463.84
let's just color it in already

5465.6 --> 5469.360000000001
let's make those lines thick so you can

5468.32 --> 5477.84
actually see it

5469.36 --> 5477.839999999999
oh christmas

5505.05 --> 5508.249
[Music]

5513.28 --> 5518.48
all right you should be able to see this

5516.32 --> 5519.92
right yeah you can finally see something

5518.48 --> 5523.36
that's just great

5519.92 --> 5526.159
okay so look at this thing

5523.36 --> 5526.88
now imagine the rectangular looping

5526.159 --> 5530.799999999999
available

5526.88 --> 5533.84
realm space is the central square

5530.8 --> 5536.88
or rectangle right so

5533.84 --> 5538.96
all the continents that we know the map

5536.88 --> 5540.159000000001
you should in your mind project that

5538.96 --> 5542.2390000000005
onto this

5540.159 --> 5544.5599999999995
and it loops east to west there's the

5542.239 --> 5544.5599999999995
black

5544.84 --> 5550.8
outline is not

5547.6 --> 5553.76
a container wall it's

5550.8 --> 5554.159000000001
simply to make it more visible to you

5553.76 --> 5556.96
that

5554.159 --> 5559.679
the outline though it actually loops in

5556.96 --> 5561.84
on itself so let's see

5559.679 --> 5561.84
this

5563.199 --> 5567.199
ends up in that that connects directly

5566.4 --> 5569.199
here

5567.199 --> 5571.12
right and who knows i'm currently

5569.199 --> 5573.199
assuming that counts for the north and

5571.12 --> 5575.92
the south as well

5573.199 --> 5578.638999999999
although yeah the loop might be open let

5575.92 --> 5578.639
me draw that

5587.44 --> 5590.96
maybe it's always open but i'm assuming

5589.92 --> 5594.2390000000005
that it might

5590.96 --> 5596.4
sometimes be open and then you get a

5594.239 --> 5599.44
portal as it were a connection

5596.4 --> 5602.0
just linear connection from one realm

5599.44 --> 5603.28
space to the other the gates open to the

5602.0 --> 5606.56
other realm

5603.28 --> 5607.599999999999
right so the circles with the crosses in

5606.56 --> 5611.4400000000005
them

5607.6 --> 5615.04
i'm assuming in this imagination in this

5611.44 --> 5617.678999999999
visualization stunt the realm

5615.04 --> 5618.56
that those might be the pillars

5617.679 --> 5621.52
upholding

5618.56 --> 5623.84
the roof which is literally looping in

5621.52 --> 5626.0
on itself right so

5623.84 --> 5627.6
it's a flat top that's on top of this

5626.0 --> 5630.639
all but there's no walls it

5627.6 --> 5631.4400000000005
loops it loops everywhere it loops

5630.639 --> 5635.1990000000005
everywhere

5631.44 --> 5638.719
and the top is everywhere

5635.199 --> 5641.678999999999
right well if something is holding it up

5638.719 --> 5644.0
if that would be a requirement then

5641.679 --> 5647.28
there might be pillars

5644.0 --> 5650.56
that are literally from the bottom of

5647.28 --> 5653.679
the realm to the top of the realm

5650.56 --> 5654.96
but those pillars might simply never be

5653.679 --> 5657.4400000000005
in reach

5654.96 --> 5658.2390000000005
they might be outside of the regular

5657.44 --> 5661.12
realm

5658.239 --> 5662.959999999999
loop segments you might at some point

5661.12 --> 5665.599999999999
some

5662.96 --> 5666.08
heavy interdimensional way be able to

5665.6 --> 5668.400000000001
reach

5666.08 --> 5671.679
there but i don't think you could reach

5668.4 --> 5673.679
them within the physical realm

5671.679 --> 5675.12
because why because if you could reach

5673.679 --> 5676.56
them in the physical realm then who

5675.12 --> 5679.679
knows what you could do with them

5676.56 --> 5682.8
and you might be able to completely

5679.679 --> 5684.719
topple the table

5682.8 --> 5686.56
right if you can only reach them in the

5684.719 --> 5687.52
spiritual dimension then there's nothing

5686.56 --> 5691.1990000000005
you can do

5687.52 --> 5691.1990000000005
physically to alter any of it

5694.8 --> 5701.84
right so i hope you appreciate that uh

5698.0 --> 5701.84
little visualization

5714.0 --> 5717.84
you can't imagine a rectangular map

5716.88 --> 5721.28
really

5717.84 --> 5724.639
you can't imagine a rectangular map

5721.28 --> 5728.639
iron 26 but

5724.639 --> 5743.4400000000005
they're out there

5728.639 --> 5746.08
like do i need to show you one

5743.44 --> 5748.879999999999
all right and by the way with showing

5746.08 --> 5751.36
that i'm not claiming per default

5748.88 --> 5752.4800000000005
that the realm is perfectly rectangular

5751.36 --> 5755.599999999999
there's a good chance

5752.48 --> 5756.239
it might be irregular looping making it

5755.6 --> 5760.639
weird

5756.239 --> 5760.638999999999
wobbly side wobbly shaped

5761.36 --> 5764.96
the spatial availability of metaphor

5763.84 --> 5768.96
material might be

5764.96 --> 5772.159
weirdly shaped irregular looping which

5768.96 --> 5774.8
is extremely confusing

5772.159 --> 5775.28
but yeah just for the convenience i'm

5774.8 --> 5778.56
just

5775.28 --> 5781.04
assuming it's just rectangular to make

5778.56 --> 5781.04
the point

5781.119 --> 5785.839999999999
uh let's see

5786.32 --> 5798.159
where's that map right

5789.36 --> 5801.36
this one should suffice

5798.159 --> 5804.719
there you go so

5801.36 --> 5807.759999999999
fit that into

5804.719 --> 5807.76
the square i made

5811.679 --> 5815.76
and imagine that the pillars that's

5814.32 --> 5818.5599999999995
upholding

5815.76 --> 5820.400000000001
what you would probably call a firmament

5818.56 --> 5825.360000000001
or the flat top

5820.4 --> 5825.36
pillars are literally physically outside

5825.6 --> 5841.84
of the realm space outside of its loop

5854.8 --> 5859.52
do i have a telegram group no not really

5863.84 --> 5883.84
bob's cami is the same in it really

5867.44 --> 5883.839999999999
since when is that

5890.8 --> 5896.719
did she make any references to me i

5894.32 --> 5898.719
sort of doubt it like it's okay though

5896.719 --> 5901.84
you know if she agrees with this

5898.719 --> 5903.76
i'd even be open to discussing it right

5901.84 --> 5907.52
it would be interesting for a change to

5903.76 --> 5907.52
have somebody else that's actually

5907.679 --> 5914.08
on to the idea that it might be looping

5911.04 --> 5924.159
i'd have a conversation with him like

5914.08 --> 5928.159
yeah if it's cami it's fine with me

5924.159 --> 5928.159
hey hello mel b styles hey

5928.88 --> 5933.76
long time thanks for the five dollar

5930.8 --> 5933.76
super chat donation

5934.08 --> 5939.84
she's been trying to finish it for years

5936.719 --> 5939.84
oh really

5973.76 --> 5980.400000000001
right but whatever man look dude

5977.92 --> 5981.92
somebody else might just literally come

5980.4 --> 5985.199
in last minute you know

5981.92 --> 5987.84
last minute and just claim like

5985.199 --> 5988.96
yeah i just came up with the rectangular

5987.84 --> 5991.6
looping map see

5988.96 --> 5992.88
this is my data this is that and never

5991.6 --> 5994.2390000000005
even mention me

5992.88 --> 5996.96
right even though i've been talking

5994.239 --> 6000.08
about this for almost six years now

5996.96 --> 6000.719
they'll just not mention me at all not

6000.08 --> 6004.159
give me

6000.719 --> 6006.4800000000005
any credit whatsoever right i'm kind of

6004.159 --> 6009.44
expecting this because i think that

6006.48 --> 6011.919999999999
a lot of people out there really really

6009.44 --> 6011.919999999999
hate me

6012.08 --> 6015.199
because i literally give no shits and

6014.48 --> 6018.48
i'm just

6015.199 --> 6020.96
jumping ahead in time 10 years and just

6018.48 --> 6023.839999999999
putting it like it's right now

6020.96 --> 6024.56
and i think that a lot of people that

6023.84 --> 6027.76
want to like

6024.56 --> 6031.360000000001
take credit for things that they really

6027.76 --> 6032.4800000000005
really hate me for that so yeah i expect

6031.36 --> 6034.5599999999995
not to be mentioned

6032.48 --> 6037.5199999999995
at all you know like nathan oakley

6034.56 --> 6038.4800000000005
mentions me for rio he actually gives me

6037.52 --> 6040.320000000001
credit

6038.48 --> 6043.199
john does too by the way and all of the

6040.32 --> 6046.239
guys there but out there

6043.199 --> 6048.5599999999995
nobody nobody's ever heard of me

6046.239 --> 6051.839999999999
even though i've been around on a daily

6048.56 --> 6051.84
basis for years

6056.32 --> 6065.84
i can't converse with kami and not elf

6060.96 --> 6068.2390000000005
well well i might be able to

6065.84 --> 6069.1990000000005
but she would have to realize that i am

6068.239 --> 6073.28
not

6069.199 --> 6076.239
going to play this safe space game

6073.28 --> 6076.8
will be absolutely direct and polite

6076.239 --> 6080.0
with

6076.8 --> 6083.6
will not roll over things like

6080.0 --> 6086.239
that no i'm not doing that

6083.6 --> 6087.92
but i will absolutely if i see something

6086.239 --> 6089.5199999999995
if i think about it and i think it's

6087.92 --> 6092.639
true i will say it

6089.52 --> 6092.96
even though the implication might be oh

6092.639 --> 6095.119
no

6092.96 --> 6096.88
i'm being discovered or no that's a bad

6095.119 --> 6097.839999999999
quality that we don't want people to

6096.88 --> 6101.679
think about yeah

6097.84 --> 6105.04
well that's too bad then right

6101.679 --> 6108.719
that's how i am i am technically open

6105.04 --> 6108.719
to have a conversation with cami

6108.88 --> 6115.52
but if she's going to play the bob game

6111.92 --> 6115.52
then i will confront her

6119.119 --> 6123.119
but other than that i have no problem

6120.719 --> 6123.119
with her

6128.239 --> 6132.959999999999
well maybe sleeping warrior probably at

6130.4 --> 6132.96
this point

6133.52 --> 6136.96
i i don't even know what they're doing

6135.52 --> 6139.92
out there you know

6136.96 --> 6142.4800000000005
i'm seeing ball buster or blow busters

6139.92 --> 6142.4800000000005
in ages

6143.92 --> 6148.2390000000005
sounds rough but i don't think we need

6146.159 --> 6151.36
it anymore

6148.239 --> 6151.919999999999
i think nathan's work and kiwi's work

6151.36 --> 6155.599999999999
and my

6151.92 --> 6157.1990000000005
work and the debate crew which are

6155.6 --> 6159.119000000001
really like maturing up

6157.199 --> 6160.5599999999995
doing doing more and more of their own

6159.119 --> 6163.839999999999
thing this is

6160.56 --> 6163.84
all we need

6164.159 --> 6167.599999999999
and a whole bunch of the old guards flat

6166.88 --> 6170.719
earthers

6167.6 --> 6171.92
that were very happy with the easy

6170.719 --> 6173.92
period

6171.92 --> 6175.84
you could just speculate whatever you

6173.92 --> 6176.639
want nobody was going to hold you to any

6175.84 --> 6178.719
standard

6176.639 --> 6180.56
i think that those are all just kind of

6178.719 --> 6182.159
like no we don't want to get all

6180.56 --> 6184.320000000001
academic

6182.159 --> 6186.799999999999
we don't like this we want to get back

6184.32 --> 6189.92
to the old way of doing it

6186.8 --> 6193.119000000001
and that's just not going to hold up and

6189.92 --> 6193.119
they probably know it

6193.52 --> 6205.84
because things are getting serious now

6212.08 --> 6219.84
you shouting out to yourself

6222.0 --> 6226.159
how many fe camps are there besides evie

6224.8 --> 6228.400000000001
oakley

6226.159 --> 6228.4
uh

6231.04 --> 6234.719
there's not really camps there's just

6233.44 --> 6237.119
hives there's just

6234.719 --> 6240.159
places where people like to hang around

6237.119 --> 6242.239
because they like how people

6240.159 --> 6243.759999999999
do things there or how much freedom they

6242.239 --> 6247.28
might have

6243.76 --> 6249.679
in a certain way

6247.28 --> 6251.84
i don't know of any other camps maybe

6249.679 --> 6251.84
the

6252.32 --> 6256.4
flat earth society could be considered a

6258.84 --> 6263.119000000001
camp

6260.32 --> 6265.28
and you might be able to consider some

6263.119 --> 6268.48
really serious controlled opposition

6265.28 --> 6271.28
fake flat earthers a camp

6268.48 --> 6273.04
that are probably there for the ballers

6271.28 --> 6274.0
you could consider them as a camp

6273.04 --> 6289.84
although i don't know how

6274.0 --> 6289.84
cohesive they are among one another

6295.84 --> 6300.0
selfie shoutouts are the way for no

6297.84 --> 6300.56
they're not sleeping warrior no they're

6300.0 --> 6304.239
not

6300.56 --> 6304.2390000000005
but yeah nathan does do that

6306.32 --> 6311.92
don't some things you don't want to take

6309.679 --> 6311.92
over

6312.48 --> 6331.839999999999
but he does it for professional reasons

6315.52 --> 6331.84
because he's constantly advertising

6343.119 --> 6346.08
equidistant nap

6348.48 --> 6351.759999999999
well it's still a projection though

6350.4 --> 6359.839999999999
carol

6351.76 --> 6359.84
that's the problem you know

6360.0 --> 6364.0
is nathan live today i think so he

6361.84 --> 6369.52
should be live

6364.0 --> 6373.84
yeah there is a uh he has an open panel

6369.52 --> 6373.84
so there will be flat earth debates

6386.239 --> 6401.839999999999
all right i'll be back in two minutes

6388.639 --> 6401.84
when i'm running at the show

6468.84 --> 6471.84
so

6483.44 --> 6485.839999999999
you

6510.84 --> 6513.84
hmm

6516.88 --> 6522.32
right so anything else

6520.08 --> 6527.84
you guys want me to address in the last

6522.32 --> 6527.84
five minutes

6540.08 --> 6543.44
i thought so iron 26 because i

6542.48 --> 6546.799999999999
remembered that

6543.44 --> 6550.08
i remember it too that cami at one point

6546.8 --> 6554.2390000000005
seemed to entertain it and i

6550.08 --> 6557.679
actually at that that was like before

6554.239 --> 6557.678999999999
went all sour with bob

6558.0 --> 6562.08
and at the time i thought that i could

6560.159 --> 6566.48
like connect up with her and

6562.08 --> 6569.36
we almost did in a way and then

6566.48 --> 6571.598999999999
she was just like yeah she stopped doing

6569.36 --> 6571.598999999999
that

6572.159 --> 6576.159
like the bridge was retracted all of a

6580.84 --> 6583.84
sudden

6609.599 --> 6613.28
how something could cause it to pac-man

6611.76 --> 6616.8
well yeah well that's

6613.28 --> 6616.8
special dynamics right

6617.679 --> 6624.2390000000005
how could it happen well if it's flat

6622.0 --> 6627.679
and you move over a straight line and

6624.239 --> 6631.199
end up in exactly the same spot

6627.679 --> 6632.96
then what else are you gonna do why

6631.199 --> 6636.0
like is it really important to figure

6632.96 --> 6638.08
out how that is physically possible

6636.0 --> 6639.119
or just is it more important to

6638.08 --> 6643.599
establish

6639.119 --> 6643.598999999999
what is actually going on right

6644.159 --> 6647.199
that's where i come in

6647.599 --> 6655.84
it's more to establish what is

6653.119 --> 6658.5599999999995
like i i don't even know where to begin

6655.84 --> 6661.679
like oh yeah how do you create a space

6658.56 --> 6663.04
looping in on itself well who knows man

6661.679 --> 6666.08
maybe there is like

6663.04 --> 6669.599
really freaky weird technology to do

6666.08 --> 6671.119
that to create like a wormhole space or

6669.599 --> 6675.599
something it's

6671.119 --> 6675.598999999999
freaky the idea is

6676.159 --> 6681.839999999999
probably not let's hope not

6683.92 --> 6687.76
maybe there is and if there is

6689.52 --> 6693.599
it's probably not really relevant to us

6693.76 --> 6709.84
as individuals

6711.92 --> 6716.56
fbi exploiting a weakness in bitcoin

6714.88 --> 6723.84
wallet

6716.56 --> 6723.84
huh okay

6758.239 --> 6765.839999999999
no way that happened

6779.599 --> 6784.639
what they got the btc back from an

6782.08 --> 6793.84
exchange if we are warrant

6784.639 --> 6793.84
what that's bizarre

6804.84 --> 6807.84
hmm

6812.32 --> 6818.239
right so yeah i'm gonna run out so i'm

6814.08 --> 6818.239
not gonna bring up bitcoin stuff again

6818.84 --> 6824.400000000001
