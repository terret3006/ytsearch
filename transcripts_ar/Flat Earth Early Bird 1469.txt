groceries after the show

140.7 --> 147.44
man this Camp is so it's you just can't

144.36 --> 147.44000000000003
do anything with it

147.78 --> 154.26
it's really only short range I mean

152.099 --> 156.54
you can barely even see the trees that

154.26 --> 158.22
are right over there

156.54 --> 161.519
it's just over

158.22 --> 164.879
ly bright but anyway the weather is

161.519 --> 166.86
kind of dry a little bit cloudy but

164.879 --> 170.28
there's almost no wind

166.86 --> 172.8
and in a way it's kind of pleasant

170.28 --> 175.34
kind of hope it's gonna stay dry when I

172.8 --> 175.34
go out later

177.84 --> 182.48
but yeah there's not much you can see of

180.18 --> 182.48000000000002
it

194.819 --> 200.0
all right

196.04 --> 200.0
and this thing is like

200.04 --> 204.14
more zoomed in than the other one

205.56 --> 208.28
I know

213.92 --> 219.48
come on

216.239 --> 221.959

the show yes that you're winning the

258.72 --> 264.96000000000004
chat yesterday I could be

261.479 --> 267.24
I mean yesterday's show was messy

264.96 --> 268.5
there we met I was not in a super great

267.24 --> 270.36
mood

268.5 --> 272.58
and then like when everything goes wrong

270.36 --> 274.62
I I just got really pissed off and

272.58 --> 278.24
started

274.62 --> 278.24
just hammering sucks

281.92 --> 285.04900000000004
[Music]

287.73 --> 294.199
[Music]

289.38 --> 294.199
yeah I can sharpen this thing up

295.259 --> 298.16
all right

303.18 --> 307.28000000000003
wait New Year's Eve is your sister's

306.06 --> 312.62
birthday

307.28 --> 312.61999999999995
okay that's a little inconvenient

312.96 --> 316.94
right

314.16 --> 316.94
happy birthday

320.18 --> 323.78000000000003
she couldn't help it

324.18 --> 326.90000000000003
huh

337.08 --> 344.65999999999997
right so oh most of you watching have

340.32 --> 344.65999999999997
like recovered now from the festivities

344.88 --> 349.44
I feel I do

347.34 --> 352.38
it's a pretty good dinner yesterday I

349.44 --> 354.9
made nasifu young high as I said I would

352.38 --> 356.039
and kind of overstuff myself with that a

354.9 --> 359.96
bit

356.039 --> 359.96
but I still slept great

361.979 --> 368.94
so I feel decently rested and

366.12 --> 372.3
still kind of full still

368.94 --> 374.639
but yeah it was good and that first meal

372.3 --> 376.88
it's always hard not to eat like huge

374.639 --> 378.539
amount

376.88 --> 380.52
[Music]

378.539 --> 382.82
it's been such a long time since I made

380.52 --> 382.82
that

383.039 --> 386.09999999999997
anyway

384.36 --> 390.62
uh

386.1 --> 390.62
yesterday overall was a bit quiet day

392.639 --> 395.639
foreign

406.22 --> 410.94000000000005
I mean there's a lot of Nutters out

408.78 --> 413.28
there in the world and yet Bob is also

410.94 --> 416.36
digging them up

413.28 --> 416.35999999999996
but my God

418.259 --> 426.72
some people out there are so bad

421.139 --> 430.139
are just so unbelievably bad it's insane

426.72 --> 432.78000000000003
they're completely off track

430.139 --> 435.18
like in all directions wildly like like

432.78 --> 438.479
a try train just

435.18 --> 439.86
on fire off the rails but it's just

438.479 --> 442.44
still going

439.86 --> 444.3
like the engine is still going

442.44 --> 447.12
there's a lot of crazy people out there

444.3 --> 449.639
I bet they love to project their

447.12 --> 452.88
Insanity onto people that aren't crazy

449.639 --> 455.52
like them and that still do abide by

452.88 --> 457.62
Logic

455.52 --> 459.9
uh

457.62 --> 461.48
right also Quantum conscious at a

459.9 --> 463.13899999999995
decently interesting video

461.48 --> 465.84000000000003
[Music]

463.139 --> 467.699
although it's all the same subject these

465.84 --> 470.78
days

467.699 --> 470.78000000000003
they're saying real

475.199 --> 482.819
uh yeah that was it

479.039 --> 485.039
I watched sixth day on Netflix after

482.819 --> 487.91900000000004
that was being shoved in my face for

485.039 --> 490.31899999999996
like half a year

487.919 --> 491.47999999999996
and I thought like ah watch it again and

490.319 --> 492.96000000000004
I didn't really remember

491.48 --> 495.18
[Music]

492.96 --> 498.44
may have seen it like

495.18 --> 498.44
a long time ago

498.96 --> 502.21999999999997
I don't know it's not

502.5 --> 507.72
really worth talking about that much it

505.74 --> 509.479
was all about cloning and oh look it's

507.72 --> 513.98
the future

509.479 --> 517.179
technology it's all so easy now right

513.98 --> 517.179
[Music]

518.219 --> 523.5600000000001
I mean we all have those fridges now

520.86 --> 526.86
where you can literally put

523.56 --> 529.56
your stuff in it and it'll tell you how

526.86 --> 532.26
full your milk is and you can Auto order

529.56 --> 534.66
it from the refrigerator

532.26 --> 537.06
I mean that's standard right that's

534.66 --> 540.56
standard now no

537.06 --> 540.56
but they did have like

541.94 --> 547.5
interesting typical ideas for future

544.8 --> 550.1999999999999
appliances

547.5 --> 552.42
but it was like a little over focused on

550.2 --> 555.48
that too I mean if you compare the movie

552.42 --> 558.18
to say Minority Report

555.48 --> 561.019
then Minority Report seems much more

558.18 --> 561.019
realistic

561.72 --> 567.4200000000001
because it also has conveniences but

563.94 --> 569.4590000000001
it's not so much in your face

567.42 --> 572.3389999999999
it's not like oh everybody's living in

569.459 --> 575.2199999999999
luxury now no not at all

572.339 --> 577.019
it's much more realistic that way

575.22 --> 578.76
right it's just like oh there's changes

577.019 --> 580.8
no but you don't really talk about them

578.76 --> 583.26
it's it's just happened

580.8 --> 587.9399999999999
anyway

583.26 --> 589.58
uh a flatter Sage good to see you

587.94 --> 595.0400000000001
foreign

589.58 --> 598.76
[Music]

595.04 --> 598.76
Armstrong Happy New Year

606.42 --> 608.899
all right

613.14 --> 619.56
any big plants for 2033

617.7 --> 623.6
uh

619.56 --> 623.5999999999999
you you're a decade early

624.98 --> 632.3100000000001
2023 your plans will not very specific

629.04 --> 633.8389999999999
plans I mean keep going

632.31 --> 636.8389999999999
[Music]

633.839 --> 640.2600000000001
and I'm kind of rooting for

636.839 --> 642.1800000000001
the wef situation in the Netherlands to

640.26 --> 644.76
end and that will look

642.18 --> 646.56
there's just not a lot of plans or

644.76 --> 650.399
there's not a lot of foundation right

646.56 --> 653.0999999999999
now on which I can like build like that

650.399 --> 656.279
because I think that the country might

653.1 --> 659.4590000000001
become slightly unstable soon

656.279 --> 661.4399999999999
which will also bring well rearrangement

659.459 --> 663.779
and New Opportunities and I might have

661.44 --> 665.6400000000001
to like completely reassess my situation

663.779 --> 668.04
here

665.64 --> 672.0
so we'll see

668.04 --> 676.1999999999999
the year to get a lady friend maybe

672.0 --> 679.8
I mean I 2022 I've been looking

676.2 --> 683.6400000000001
it's just not really

679.8 --> 685.8
felt like yeah man I'm gonna go for it

683.64 --> 689.279
it's just like yeah there's some

685.8 --> 693.42
interesting girls out there

689.279 --> 696.3
decently interesting but

693.42 --> 699.899
there's been no strong impulses from

696.3 --> 702.5999999999999
them towards me yet

699.899 --> 705.72
so we'll see you know I'm just gonna

702.6 --> 707.88
keep going on and doing what I do and

705.72 --> 710.7
I mean it's really gonna for me to be

707.88 --> 713.16
able to even engage in dating

710.7 --> 715.2
I'm gonna have to open up my social life

713.16 --> 716.959
again

715.2 --> 720.3000000000001
and that's gonna

716.959 --> 724.14
get some taking used to and it would be

720.3 --> 728.16
very handy if I meet a girl

724.14 --> 731.519
that has the talent and the spirit

728.16 --> 736.64
to be able to get that about me

731.519 --> 736.64
right so yeah who wants to date a hermit

738.48 --> 741.9
I mean not a lot of girls out there

740.279 --> 743.64
typically do

741.9 --> 745.68
[Music]

743.64 --> 748.68
they'll have to find me particularly

745.68 --> 748.68
interesting

749.16 --> 752.12
but we'll see

756.42 --> 760.5
dating scene I don't even know the

758.76 --> 764.36
dating scene in classical homie I've

760.5 --> 764.36
never been on the dating scene

765.48 --> 768.8000000000001
I've never done that

769.139 --> 773.94
what I have done in the past is just

771.54 --> 777.06
like okay I'm just going out and then

773.94 --> 779.94
when I'm out and I feel like it then I

777.06 --> 781.3199999999999
just kind of like started flirt with

779.94 --> 785.24
women

781.32 --> 785.24
that I find interesting in some way

785.399 --> 792.72
and if one of them bites then I yeah

789.24 --> 794.82
we'll see what happens took him home

792.72 --> 797.519
sometimes afterward I was very sorry

794.82 --> 802.2
about that but that's okay because I was

797.519 --> 804.72
not like oh I have to do things now

802.2 --> 807.9200000000001
so I don't know if that time's gonna

804.72 --> 811.019
come back because that was like between

807.92 --> 815.2199999999999
2000 six

811.019 --> 816.54
and ten mostly it was like the way I was

815.22 --> 819.12
going about

816.54 --> 822.139
before

819.12 --> 822.139
I met my ex

823.68 --> 828.06
it was not like a glorious time or

826.019 --> 830.7
anything I mean it's not like oh man I

828.06 --> 832.1389999999999
can't keep all these hot chicks off me

830.7 --> 834.839

832.139 --> 837.1800000000001
nice chicks though

834.839 --> 840.3000000000001
I mean I did like when I was going on

837.18 --> 842.579
just like a certain type of girls like a

840.3 --> 844.1999999999999
little chubby but cute would come up to

842.579 --> 846.42
me and like start hugging me and stuff

844.2 --> 849.48
and it's like yeah that's

846.42 --> 852.42
I still I like I like hugging so I don't

849.48 --> 855.26
mind I don't have to have the the sex

852.42 --> 855.26
necessarily

855.839 --> 861.5400000000001
I'm just I found overall My Life

859.68 --> 864.06
I'm really much more about the

861.54 --> 868.5
companionship than the sex even though

864.06 --> 871.88
yeah once that starts I am going to be

868.5 --> 871.88
very capable

872.339 --> 874.8800000000001
all right

875.7 --> 880.7
know what I'm doing

877.8 --> 880.6999999999999
most of the time

886.26 --> 888.8
anyway

889.92 --> 897.8199999999999
look let's go homeopath

892.92 --> 900.3
dating apps I don't even use that

897.82 --> 903.3000000000001
[Music]

900.3 --> 905.899
wow message is to inflate their ego yeah

903.3 --> 905.899
but that's

906.42 --> 911.88
like it makes me sick just thinking

909.3 --> 914.279
about that literally

911.88 --> 916.68
I'm not doing that I'm not gonna do that

914.279 --> 919.019
I don't want that yeah

916.68 --> 920.6389999999999
I don't need a bunch of chicks to tell

919.019 --> 923.4590000000001
me I'm so great

920.639 --> 927.38
to inflate my ego no my ego's already

923.459 --> 927.38
pretty inflated as it is

927.72 --> 930.44
naturally

941.39 --> 948.26
[Music]

944.82 --> 950.7600000000001
the thing is I kind of aim for women

948.26 --> 953.04
[Music]

950.76 --> 955.92
most of the time x was like kind of an

953.04 --> 957.36
exception to that I aim for women where

955.92 --> 959.04
I know

957.36 --> 962.04
that even

959.04 --> 965.16
if it would end

962.04 --> 968.16
that way would still be friends

965.16 --> 969.6
afterward I mean a lot of my exes call

968.16 --> 972.36
me up

969.6 --> 976.9200000000001
as friends and I kind of like that oh it

972.36 --> 978.899
sounds so weird well in a way it is like

976.92 --> 981.12
it's a bit nostalgic

978.899 --> 983.339
but I'm just very happy because they're

981.12 --> 986.04
like really nice women

983.339 --> 988.62
that have a lot of like interesting

986.04 --> 991.92
internal world and that like like my

988.62 --> 995.16
internal world so we share about that

991.92 --> 998.42
it's like yeah you're the only one I can

995.16 --> 998.42
talk to like that Arwin

998.82 --> 1002.6800000000001
you're the only one that gets those

1000.38 --> 1002.68
things

1002.839 --> 1006.5
so right

1008.06 --> 1012.0189999999999
those were usually the women that I'd

1010.16 --> 1014.8389999999999
stick around with because they could see

1012.019 --> 1017.12
that about them it's like

1014.839 --> 1018.8000000000001
they don't want to use me and then as

1017.12 --> 1021.199
soon as that's over that they just

1018.8 --> 1026.0
switch 180 degrees and now you're the

1021.199 --> 1030.04
enemy I hate that I hate that so bad

1026.0 --> 1030.04
and this is what my ex did too in a way

1030.74 --> 1034.52
and that was a nightmare

1032.6 --> 1036.4389999999999
even though she kind of held back but

1034.52 --> 1038.66
she just couldn't help it like that was

1036.439 --> 1040.52
the way she dealt with those things

1038.66 --> 1045.3190000000002
and I do not

1040.52 --> 1047.93
I refuse to go to hate MOG I refuse

1045.319 --> 1052.079
it hurts only it only hurts me more

1067.82 --> 1073.52
my ex from naimeha

1070.58 --> 1076.039
friend that I that I call that been

1073.52 --> 1079.039
calling for years right

1076.039 --> 1082.72
she introduced me to that man she was

1079.039 --> 1082.72
really into that sort of thing back then

1083.24 --> 1087.799
she probably still is she just now she's

1085.7 --> 1088.7
a mother so she doesn't really do that

1087.799 --> 1091.8799999999999
sort of

1088.7 --> 1094.5800000000002
scene anymore really

1091.88 --> 1096.0800000000002
but I know it

1094.58 --> 1099.9189999999999
it's good

1096.08 --> 1102.799
but look I'd rather listen to mind in a

1099.919 --> 1105.64
box that's more my corner of the

1102.799 --> 1105.6399999999999
electronic music

1107.12 --> 1113.2399999999998
I mean Infected Mushroom is really just

1109.28 --> 1115.28
trip music it's like get all high and or

1113.24 --> 1119.0
whatever mushrooms and

1115.28 --> 1121.52
it's like no no it's not my thing I

1119.0 --> 1123.919
don't like that

1121.52 --> 1126.85
I just like music that makes you really

1123.919 --> 1128.1200000000001
think and feel carefully

1126.85 --> 1132.02
[Music]

1128.12 --> 1134.62
that can be classical music as well

1132.02 --> 1134.62
I mean

1135.74 --> 1139.96
Hammer Smith is still amazing

1144.5 --> 1151.9
but so uh his mind in the Box uh

1148.94 --> 1155.299
what's the name again

1151.9 --> 1158.179
Between Worlds

1155.299 --> 1162.4
it's just a different field but both of

1158.179 --> 1162.4
them really make you think and feel

1162.799 --> 1166.78
one without words

1165.32 --> 1170.12
and the other

1166.78 --> 1172.58
also with words anyway yeah mine in the

1170.12 --> 1175.2199999999998
Box we'll check them out

1172.58 --> 1177.3799999999999
yeah do that dude I've been sharing that

1175.22 --> 1180.2
about them for years

1177.38 --> 1183.6200000000001
they've been my favorite like one of my

1180.2 --> 1185.9
more solid favorite bands since 2010. I

1183.62 --> 1190.539
saw them I saw the guy live it's it's

1185.9 --> 1190.539
like one guy that does all of that

1191.539 --> 1197.12
I saw him live in uh

1194.179 --> 1199.5800000000002
in wave Gothic trefen

1197.12 --> 1201.4399999999998
but his voice box broke that was kind of

1199.58 --> 1203.059
annoying but I did like see him perform

1201.44 --> 1205.5800000000002
live

1203.059 --> 1208.48
uh

1205.58 --> 1208.48
let's see

1216.26 --> 1221.75
right when you check it Aaron Armstrong

1219.1 --> 1225.269
check this song out particularly

1221.75 --> 1225.269
[Music]

1226.34 --> 1233.6
I think it is by far standing out

1230.24 --> 1237.98
the best song they've ever made arguably

1233.6 --> 1241.8799999999999
the best song in electronics ever made

1237.98 --> 1244.1
I'm I'm not joking

1241.88 --> 1246.0800000000002
I've never heard that song and thought

1244.1 --> 1250.039
like uh

1246.08 --> 1252.02
it's getting old never not once

1250.039 --> 1254.78
but I don't like played over and over

1252.02 --> 1257.0
again either but it even then it's just

1254.78 --> 1258.6
you just get tired

1257.0 --> 1261.83
anyway

1258.6 --> 1261.83
[Music]

1274.46 --> 1280.28
timelessness

1276.62 --> 1283.0
okay well there's a lot of like wavy

1280.28 --> 1283.0
type songs

1283.22 --> 1288.44
it's a lot of like very slow songs right

1285.86 --> 1291.3799999999999
it's just him just kind of singing

1288.44 --> 1293.1200000000001
telling about some things in his past or

1291.38 --> 1293.96
something that's like the theme a lot of

1293.12 --> 1297.6789999999999
it

1293.96 --> 1299.8400000000001
then really just a bunch of electronic

1297.679 --> 1302.0
sounds that are still pretty damn

1299.84 --> 1305.32
awesome and nostalgic remind me of the

1302.0 --> 1305.32
Amiga 1200 a lot

1308.179 --> 1312.8200000000002
the overall is overall work is pretty

1310.58 --> 1312.82
good

1312.98 --> 1318.08
there's not all of the songs are like

1315.559 --> 1319.46
brilliant but they are distinctly his

1318.08 --> 1322.58
style

1319.46 --> 1323.8400000000001
but there's a few songs like arguably

1322.58 --> 1326.299
like 20

1323.84 --> 1328.76
which I condense down to four which are

1326.299 --> 1330.32
like the ultimate masterpieces and I

1328.76 --> 1332.179
keep listing them

1330.32 --> 1334.3999999999999
there's a lot of the time I use it as a

1332.179 --> 1336.44
startup music before I start the show if

1334.4 --> 1340.1000000000001
I'm like too distracted by some stupid

1336.44 --> 1341.6200000000001

his own narrative

1348.559 --> 1354.22
it's a little mini psychological story

1351.74 --> 1354.22
about

1355.4 --> 1361.64
being stuck in Between Worlds which can

1358.7 --> 1364.3400000000001
be interpreted very widely

1361.64 --> 1366.8200000000002

1709.6 --> 1713.3799999999999
absolutely ridiculous

anything seeking water stairwell star

1721.34 --> 1726.1999999999998
water didn't either

1722.84 --> 1730.279
oh well but that volcano does seem to be

active like since 2021.

1759.14 --> 1763.419
what

1760.7 --> 1763.419
okay

1780.82 --> 1785.12
everything I'm finding is like from last

1783.799 --> 1791.32
year

1785.12 --> 1791.32
because apparently Tonga in 2022 blew up

1794.38 --> 1799.46
there's this article about how we just

1797.0 --> 1801.38
rearranged the ocean floor

1799.46 --> 1803.419
because it was spewing massive amounts

1801.38 --> 1806.14
of lava

1803.419 --> 1806.14
that's it

1815.659 --> 1820.279
from what I've heard volcanic eruptions

1817.7 --> 1821.3600000000001
cause what does that mean for letter

1820.279 --> 1824.919
Sage

1821.36 --> 1824.9189999999999
what the hell does that mean

1825.919 --> 1832.64
because I do know volcanic eruptions

1828.26 --> 1835.36
spew massive amounts of CO2 and

1832.64 --> 1835.3600000000001
uh

1835.52 --> 1840.76
carbon actual carbon into the air

1847.279 --> 1854.059
but like the whole climate change

1850.6 --> 1856.1
concept is based on the globe Earth

1854.059 --> 1858.86
mechanics

1856.1 --> 1862.299
do you understand that like the entire

1858.86 --> 1862.299
word of climate change

1865.399 --> 1870.9189999999999
there is no proof that

1868.12 --> 1873.86
volcanoes literally change the climate

1870.919 --> 1876.44
on the long run

1873.86 --> 1878.299
on the short run definitely especially

1876.44 --> 1881.0
because the blocking of the sun if

1878.299 --> 1883.1589999999999

what are you gonna do

1949.159 --> 1953.98
they're so locked in there they won't

1950.96 --> 1953.98
listen to anything anyway

1954.44 --> 1961.96
right they'll only listen if you tell

1957.08 --> 1961.96
them a story of imminent short-term Doom

1963.14 --> 1967.8200000000002
because that's what they're bound to

1965.48 --> 1969.38
they're addicted to that they need that

1967.82 --> 1972.5
as a crutch

1969.38 --> 1976.419
to no longer face the world and actually

1972.5 --> 1976.419
become part of it and build in it

1977.24 --> 1981.22
and they're not gonna let go it's an

1978.86 --> 1983.899
addiction so what are you gonna do

1981.22 --> 1987.799
change their mind oh yeah real oh yeah

1983.899 --> 1989.84
I'm gonna just change that that addict

1987.799 --> 1992.24
I'm just gonna change him like stop

1989.84 --> 1993.74
making him addicted yes yes that's how

1992.24 --> 1996.74
that works you can just do that with

1993.74 --> 1999.98
other people no no you can't you can

1996.74 --> 2002.74
never do that that doesn't ever work

1999.98 --> 2004.059
the thing that works is that they have

2002.74 --> 2006.82
to face it

2004.059 --> 2010.08
and realize they're wrong by their own

2006.82 --> 2010.08
volition and then stop

2011.799 --> 2016.0
and a lot of the times people in that

2014.08 --> 2019.12
position if you just try to push it on

2016.0 --> 2021.46
them they'll just brace against it even

2019.12 --> 2023.799

2044.62 --> 2049.5
it's a nonsense [ __ ] from Bill Gates

2054.639 --> 2061.679
yeah trapped entropy

it is kind of stupid yeah

2083.099 --> 2088.839
I like heat energy so just heat energy

2086.2 --> 2090.04
then so you're thinking the heat gets

2088.839 --> 2093.0
trapped

2090.04 --> 2093.0
somehow

2095.2 --> 2099.2799999999997
it doesn't though

cold days

2112.96 --> 2119.14
it was clear sky and then you had a

2116.92 --> 2122.079
really cold night because all the heat

2119.14 --> 2124.72
can escape because it's clear

2122.079 --> 2127.7200000000003
now when it was clouded it wasn't very

2124.72 --> 2129.22
warm but it wouldn't freeze because the

2127.72 --> 2132.339
heat wouldn't Escape because there's

2129.22 --> 2133.7799999999997
clouds keeping it in yeah clouds water

2132.339 --> 2136.18
vapor

2133.78 --> 2137.619
sorry well no it's not water droplets

2136.18 --> 2139.06
really otherwise it's not a cloud it's

2137.619 --> 2143.28
just water vapor

2139.06 --> 2143.2799999999997
but the water keeps it in that's known

2145.42 --> 2148.8
now how

2148.9 --> 2154.8
volcanic ash

2151.359 --> 2157.48
in the air is supposed to do that

2154.8 --> 2158.92
I don't know how is it supposed to do

2157.48 --> 2161.82
that I mean

2158.92 --> 2161.82
pretty sure

2163.42 --> 2168.339
it's

2164.98 --> 2170.64
it's not really gonna stop that it's not

2168.339 --> 2175.5
gonna physically trap they eat

2170.64 --> 2175.5
Underneath It Like Water clouds

2176.2 --> 2180.06
so I don't know what you're talking

2177.76 --> 2180.0600000000004
about

2180.88 --> 2188.619
right the main climate type of change

2185.56 --> 2192.7599999999998
that for for big volcanic eruptions tend

2188.619 --> 2195.099
to historically do is cover the uh the

2192.76 --> 2196.96
cloud yeah cover the sky with ashes so

2195.099 --> 2201.06
that barely any sunlight comes through

2196.96 --> 2204.16
for a while then things get cold

2201.06 --> 2207.339
plants suffer under it

2204.16 --> 2209.859
animals get kind of hysterical due to a

2207.339 --> 2212.38
sec lack of sunlight

2209.859 --> 2216.0
and humans do and that's kind of the

2212.38 --> 2216.0
influence it does go away again

2236.94 --> 2242.099
what are you blabbering about a Goomba

2239.8 --> 2242.099
virus

2243.48 --> 2247.54
entropy to space

2245.859 --> 2251.88
what what

2247.54 --> 2251.88
how is it giving off heat to space

2252.7 --> 2255.66
what the [ __ ]

2256.599 --> 2264.3590000000004
how is it supposed to give off its heat

2261.28 --> 2264.3590000000004
to vacuum

2267.28 --> 2273.6600000000003
it makes no sense of humu virus it makes

2269.8 --> 2273.6600000000003
no sense for many different angles

2280.839 --> 2285.5099999999998
radiation

2282.42 --> 2285.51
[Music]

2285.88 --> 2288.96
makes no sense

2289.24 --> 2294.0989999999997
if there's no air there then how is it

2291.579 --> 2300.0
going to transfer heat

2294.099 --> 2300.0
to it it makes no sense makes no sense

2315.24 --> 2319.74
okay in the globe model sure

2321.76 --> 2326.92
but makes absolutely no sense though

2324.28 --> 2330.099
because you need actual material to

2326.92 --> 2332.2000000000003
transfer heat vacuum doesn't have that

2330.099 --> 2334.98
so it wouldn't even matter if something

2332.2 --> 2334.98
radiates

2339.76 --> 2345.6400000000003
there's no heat transfer you need

2343.18 --> 2347.6189999999997
something else to heat up

2345.64 --> 2350.2799999999997
if there's nothing there then there's no

2347.619 --> 2350.28
heat transfer

2356.619 --> 2361.3
right

2358.0 --> 2364.68
now of course the heat is going to

2361.3 --> 2368.32
transfer from the lower

2364.68 --> 2370.48
levels of the surface

2368.32 --> 2373.2400000000002
the arrow over there to the higher

2370.48 --> 2375.099
levels which are naturally colder

2373.24 --> 2378.0
yeah but because there's something there

2375.099 --> 2378.0
to transfer to

2378.88 --> 2385.2000000000003
right and eventually somehow some way

2382.0 --> 2385.2
there might be some

2386.32 --> 2393.099
heat exchange with like the top

2389.74 --> 2395.3799999999997
which in my like technical opinion

2393.099 --> 2398.44
should be cold

2395.38 --> 2399.339
in order for the gradiation here on

2398.44 --> 2402.7000000000003
Earth

2399.339 --> 2405.64
within the available space and the gas

2402.7 --> 2409.24
is within the waves gradated that should

2405.64 --> 2412.06
it should be cold up there

2409.24 --> 2415.1189999999997
but on a globe model like what

2412.06 --> 2418.859
transferred to space how do you transfer

2415.119 --> 2418.859
heat to nothing

2419.56 --> 2424.9
makes no sense

2422.32 --> 2427.3590000000004
right that's

2424.9 --> 2430.32
did you

2427.359 --> 2430.3199999999997
foreign

2438.359 --> 2444.94
yeah I didn't even address the whole gas

2442.119 --> 2447.7200000000003
expanding into a vacuum part seeking

2444.94 --> 2447.7200000000003
style water I

2449.14 --> 2455.02
mean that's obvious yeah I can hammer in

2452.2 --> 2457.18
I can make him shut up Oakley style

2455.02 --> 2459.339
but I could also try to point out that

2457.18 --> 2460.72
even if you overlook that it still makes

2459.339 --> 2463.54
no sense

2460.72 --> 2466.0
right that's what I like to do go into

2463.54 --> 2469.06
their concept and then point out how

2466.0 --> 2470.14
from their perspective it still makes no

2469.06 --> 2473.46
sense

2470.14 --> 2473.46
that's what I like to do

2481.16 --> 2484.7999999999997
[Music]

2498.16 --> 2502.66
yeah I don't yeah you can do that at

2500.56 --> 2504.04
Google virus but it's not really

2502.66 --> 2506.98
relevant

2504.04 --> 2509.74
my point is you need

2506.98 --> 2512.14
material

2509.74 --> 2515.3799999999997
to transfer a heat

2512.14 --> 2517.48
to have that happen even with radiation

2515.38 --> 2522.28
I mean if there's nothing there to

2517.48 --> 2526.5
absorb it then there is no heat transfer

2522.28 --> 2526.5
it's just the radiation doing nothing

foreign

2551.5 --> 2554.71

don't take us

2561.76 --> 2566.8
um some dragging tour through all the

2564.52 --> 2569.079
nonsense and how about we just stick to

2566.8 --> 2571.3590000000004
what we were talking about

2569.079 --> 2574.3590000000004
supposed climate change how that works

2571.359 --> 2576.8199999999997
and then heat transfer to space how

2574.359 --> 2579.46
about we just stick to that and not move

2576.82 --> 2582.099
on oh why does the sun move in the

it's not this subject we're not talking

2584.02 --> 2590.2599999999998
about that why don't you not move away

2587.38 --> 2593.02
to another subject conveniently

2590.26 --> 2594.8190000000004
how about we stick to the subject

2593.02 --> 2597.72
heat transfer

2594.819 --> 2597.72
to space

2597.76 --> 2603.0400000000004
once you look that up

2599.94 --> 2606.9
specifically heat transfers

2603.04 --> 2606.9
heat transfer to space

scatter gunning him with other subjects

2631.3 --> 2636.819
you're just gonna force him to move away

2633.819 --> 2639.7
from the subject don't you get it

2636.819 --> 2641.319
you die you don't need to Virtue signal

that you know

2641.319 --> 2645.599
the ball model is [ __ ] I mean

2647.079 --> 2654.52
I have no control over it

2649.66 --> 2656.92
like a neurotic you have to do that or

2654.52 --> 2658.96
are you confident enough that pretty

2656.92 --> 2660.48
much everyone in the chat myself

2658.96 --> 2664.359
included

2660.48 --> 2666.76
knows about that you know that

2664.359 --> 2669.7799999999997
and you don't need to blurt it out every

2666.76 --> 2669.78
opportunity you get

2687.0 --> 2693.28
back through see a fascinating the

2690.339 --> 2695.92
living Taurus field okay

2693.28 --> 2699.6600000000003
okay seeking star water not entirely

2695.92 --> 2699.66
sure if that is literally what that is

2701.319 --> 2706.96
when I from what I understand it's

2703.24 --> 2709.54
mostly a slightly out of focus p900

2706.96 --> 2712.0
that causes that effect

2709.54 --> 2714.48
it's not that it's not the actual

2712.0 --> 2714.48
default

2717.4 --> 2720.7200000000003
it's a focus issue

2720.76 --> 2725.2000000000003
that's a very fascinating Focus issue I

2723.64 --> 2728.2
mean it's still kind of mysterious that

2725.2 --> 2731.02
it look looks a little bit like water

2728.2 --> 2733.48
when you do that that on its own is kind

2731.02 --> 2736.18
of mysterious but that is not literally

2733.48 --> 2737.619
what it is it's the camera slightly out

2736.18 --> 2739.7799999999997
of focus

2737.619 --> 2742.98
that's what that is

2739.78 --> 2742.98
you got to keep it real

popular myths are the worst

what you need is solid fact not popular

2760.96 --> 2764.56

2762.579 --> 2766.96
yeah you don't need to make it all

2764.56 --> 2770.14
mysterious to lure people in you just

2766.96 --> 2774.3
gotta be factual about it

2770.14 --> 2774.2999999999997
it's already mysterious Enough by itself

in that model yeah it's no evidence for

2819.16 --> 2821.8799999999997
that at all though

2831.04 --> 2836.319
I mean that what you're reading is based

2834.099 --> 2839.98
on the presupposition that the sun is a

2836.319 --> 2842.14
giant ball of gas burning in a vacuum at

2839.98 --> 2845.26
a massive distance

2842.14 --> 2847.1189999999997
and then transferring that heat all that

don't even know what the Sun is

2979.24 --> 2986.0789999999997
as far as I'm concerned the sun is a

2982.72 --> 2988.359
little hologram that is at the epicenter

2986.079 --> 2991.119
of the daylight Direction which is the

2988.359 --> 2994.18
real thing it's the daylight Direction

2991.119 --> 2998.5
it's a manifestation it manifests

2994.18 --> 2999.7599999999998
and then everything that it touches it's

2998.5 --> 3002.839
like

2999.76 --> 3002.8390000000004
oh yeah

3003.359 --> 3010.02
kind of like a holographic field

3006.119 --> 3013.1400000000003

3010.02 --> 3014.819

the etymology of something yeah I

3050.579 --> 3057.78
remember has not anything to do with the

actual argument of what is the Sun and

3057.78 --> 3063.78
what is sunlight has nothing to do with

3060.059 --> 3067.559
that yeah it was an etymological error

3063.78 --> 3069.119
you know what that means etymology

3067.559 --> 3072.3
yeah

3069.119 --> 3073.8
like the original root meaning of the

3073.8 --> 3081.42
yeah it wasn't a mechanical argument

3255.66 --> 3262.2599999999998
but as far as I'm concerned

3258.359 --> 3264.0
he doesn't transfer to non-material to a

3262.26 --> 3267.6800000000003
vacuum

3264.0 --> 3267.68
it just doesn't do that

3270.0 --> 3277.26
now material that is hot will probably

3274.079 --> 3281.3
more quickly spread out in the vacuum

3277.26 --> 3281.3
and then like average out

3281.94 --> 3286.2200000000003
but just heat transfer no

3286.68 --> 3290.52
because

3287.54 --> 3292.44
e-transfer is literally what heat is is

3290.52 --> 3295.2599999999998
material

3292.44 --> 3297.9
that is like resonating

3295.26 --> 3300.8390000000004
with heat it's vibrating that's how it's

3297.9 --> 3301.92
described and I think that that model is

3300.839 --> 3304.14
pretty

3301.92 --> 3305.94
accurate whether it's absolutely literal

3304.14 --> 3308.0989999999997
not as doesn't matter

3305.94 --> 3310.38
it is a good description it does seem to

3308.099 --> 3313.38
mechanically work out right but the

3310.38 --> 3317.54
whole point is is if there's no material

3313.38 --> 3317.54
then there's no heat transfer

3319.079 --> 3323.579
right material can only transfer its

3321.359 --> 3326.5789999999997
heat to other material

[Music]

3384.0 --> 3390.619
maybe an extreme heat situations I I

3387.18 --> 3390.6189999999997
don't know about that part

3397.02 --> 3402.24
but from what I from what I've learned

3399.9 --> 3404.94
it's like heat and radiation

3402.24 --> 3406.9799999999996
like over a distance

3404.94 --> 3410.28
it's like a field

3406.98 --> 3412.7400000000002
it's pretty much I don't think it has a

3410.28 --> 3415.1400000000003
speed of travel

3412.74 --> 3418.7599999999998
it's pretty much instantaneous it's like

3415.14 --> 3418.7599999999998
within reach it connects

3419.339 --> 3424.099
and then the heat energy is transferred

3421.68 --> 3424.0989999999997
that way

3425.099 --> 3429.839
but it doesn't like travel at a speed it

3427.859 --> 3430.98
doesn't take time before it arrives it's

3429.839 --> 3434.48
just there

3430.98 --> 3434.48
it's there or it's not there

3449.28 --> 3453.7400000000002
heat radiates medium that needed well

3454.02 --> 3462.42
not all heat radiates like that I mean

3459.119 --> 3465.78
if something is hot and it is perfectly

3462.42 --> 3467.46
isolated from all sides like in a box in

3465.78 --> 3471.2000000000003
a vacuum chamber

3467.46 --> 3471.2
it's not going to lose its heat

3471.42 --> 3475.38
because it it it's not transferring it

3474.42 --> 3478.319
can't

3475.38 --> 3482.099
yeah the entropy is halted like that

3478.319 --> 3484.02
right that's that wasn't the idea

3482.099 --> 3488.0
but that's only if there's like

3484.02 --> 3488.0
something physically obstructing

3488.28 --> 3492.559
well the material spreading out to it

3495.599 --> 3501.19
right it's not losing its heat or very

3498.18 --> 3504.3599999999997
little through radiation

3501.19 --> 3504.36
[Music]

3507.119 --> 3512.88
ah so in that sense yeah I guess that

3510.78 --> 3515.28
heat radiation does kind of transfer

3512.88 --> 3518.28
even through a vacuum but there still

3515.28 --> 3520.559
has to be material there

3518.28 --> 3524.8390000000004
to heat up

3520.559 --> 3524.8390000000004
on the other side of that vacuum

3532.5 --> 3534.92
right

3537.619 --> 3543.559
exactly yeah so Earth is an open system

3549.96 --> 3554.579
so yeah theoretically if you think that

3552.299 --> 3556.859
it's a little vacuum out there then from

3554.579 --> 3559.52
one thing to another with extreme heat

3556.859 --> 3559.52
radiation

3560.7 --> 3565.52
yeah I think that you could argue how

3563.76 --> 3568.619
that's possible

3565.52 --> 3571.44
theoretically except none of that entire

3568.619 --> 3573.96
setup is actually what's happening or

3571.44 --> 3576.2400000000002

3629.52 --> 3632.0
thank you

3633.96 --> 3642.14
does heat reflect off non-space no

3638.0 --> 3642.14
non-space doesn't reflect anything

3643.5 --> 3648.18
but if it's a field

3645.96 --> 3650.4
like light

3648.18 --> 3652.799
then I've already argued out there's two

3650.4 --> 3656.52
options about non-space the conceptual

3652.799 --> 3657.96
stuff that might actually be real

3656.52 --> 3660.18
right

3657.96 --> 3664.14
non-space

3660.18 --> 3665.7599999999998
either it allows Fields through in which

3664.14 --> 3668.7599999999998
case it could

3665.76 --> 3671.579
radiate yeah heat radiation might like

3668.76 --> 3673.5
go right through it

3671.579 --> 3676.02
and so would light

3673.5 --> 3679.92
or neither

3676.02 --> 3682.74
and it will simply not manifest any kind

3679.92 --> 3684.54
of light through it or heat radiation or

3682.74 --> 3686.9599999999996
anything

3684.54 --> 3693.1

Optical that's not gonna happen into

3710.22 --> 3715.3799999999997
non-space because you need material to

3712.74 --> 3717.4799999999996
transfer a heat like that but again like

3715.38 --> 3721.44
radiation Heat

3717.48 --> 3724.38
it might it might go through

3721.44 --> 3726.18
if sunlight or if any type of light will

3724.38 --> 3730.339
also go through non-space

4272.78 --> 4277.4
your fears

4274.46 --> 4280.88
that you're escaping obviously

4277.4 --> 4282.5
logically every single time by this

4280.88 --> 4285.62
troll Behavior

4282.5 --> 4289.9
it needs to stop it needs to be

4285.62 --> 4289.9
addressed and taken care of

4293.24 --> 4296.33

4296.38 --> 4299.38
thank you

4301.59 --> 4308.84
[Music]

4305.96 --> 4312.58
hey Tony Whitcomb what trolls I was

4308.84 --> 4312.58
talking about trolls earlier in chat

4313.699 --> 4317.44
they were just being disruptive

4322.1 --> 4325.319
[Music]

4330.8 --> 4333.400000000001
foreign

4357.66 --> 4363.199
[Music]

4359.719 --> 4365.179
okay it seems to stop raining again cool

4363.199 --> 4367.4
right so at least there isn't going to

4365.179 --> 4370.96
be a flat Earth debates live finally

4367.4 --> 4370.96
Nathan put out the link

4372.14 --> 4375.88
that's going to start in half an hour

4380.06 --> 4387.64
Flat Earth is 100 no no turret that's

4384.44 --> 4390.62
absolutely a really dumb

4387.64 --> 4394.34
transparent Bluff it's not true

4390.62 --> 4397.4
100 track record about precisions

4394.34 --> 4401.84
have you even looked out there

4397.4 --> 4404.36
I mean yes Flat Earth Debaters I'd say

4401.84 --> 4405.860000000001
pretty one of the best track records on

4404.36 --> 4409.099999999999
that yeah

4405.86 --> 4411.799999999999
but that's just one little group

4409.1 --> 4415.76
and that does not include the followers

4411.8 --> 4419.4800000000005
who still get a lot of [ __ ] wrong

4415.76 --> 4423.159000000001
and over like standard arguments that

4419.48 --> 4423.159
aren't really well thought through

4423.26 --> 4430.179
so no not a hundred percent track record

4428.0 --> 4430.179
thank you

4434.08 --> 4439.05
but better than globers I mean at least

4437.42 --> 4442.189
ours make logical sense

4439.05 --> 4442.189
[Music]

4448.88 --> 4452.38
and it's be no it isn't

4458.3 --> 4464.360000000001
or unless you're referring to specific

4461.179 --> 4466.88
like astrological events

4464.36 --> 4470.32
but yeah that those aren't technically

4466.88 --> 4470.32
all that difficult to predict

4473.0 --> 4476.8
giant discipline surrounding that

4482.38 --> 4489.32
letter is

4485.06 --> 4492.34
The Lies 100 no no dare not tarot

4489.32 --> 4495.139999999999
they're not a hundred percent right yeah

4492.34 --> 4498.82
blabbering flat earthers make a lot of

4495.14 --> 4501.320000000001
really stupid mistakes

4498.82 --> 4502.82
no they're wrong a lot because you just

4501.32 --> 4505.5199999999995
think oh

4502.82 --> 4507.799999999999
we're always right because the Earth is

4505.52 --> 4509.900000000001
like flat and not that ball so

4507.8 --> 4512.06
everything they say is always over

4509.9 --> 4516.44
generalization

4512.06 --> 4518.120000000001
leads to the worst set of Errors a

4516.44 --> 4521.0599999999995
person can make

4518.12 --> 4522.32
yeah and it happens a lot with flat

4521.06 --> 4525.8
earthers

4522.32 --> 4531.159
they blabber on like blabbermouth idiots

4525.8 --> 4531.159000000001
and they get a lot wrong they do

4531.199 --> 4535.659
more Bluster the more error

4538.64 --> 4543.26
if I've been able to straight no Stephen

4541.1 --> 4546.400000000001
you that doesn't work you can't

4543.26 --> 4546.400000000001
straighten out Brian

4547.159 --> 4554.12
either he slowly accepts it or forgets

4551.48 --> 4558.159
about it if you confront him about such

4554.12 --> 4558.159
things he will never admit to it

4562.94 --> 4568.339999999999
I mean he hasn't made look you could see

4566.12 --> 4571.219
it as that he's conceited because he

4568.34 --> 4574.159000000001
didn't make a presentation about it to

4571.219 --> 4577.1
counter me right like when he goes up

4574.159 --> 4578.96
against Bev and other idiots he makes a

4577.1 --> 4581.84
presentation to prove his point he

4578.96 --> 4584.719
didn't do that with me though

4581.84 --> 4587.900000000001
because it's wrong

4584.719 --> 4589.64
and he just doesn't want to admit it

4587.9 --> 4593.239
right and it doesn't even matter because

4589.64 --> 4596.659000000001
it's like what the globe claims right so

4593.239 --> 4598.879999999999
he doesn't really care all that much and

4596.659 --> 4603.28
neither does Nathan

4598.88 --> 4603.28
I care more about those types of things

4607.04 --> 4611.9
but Brian is just

4609.62 --> 4614.9
in a hunting mode and he's going after

4611.9 --> 4617.659
Bev so I'm just gonna let him do that

4614.9 --> 4620.179
and not start poking him

4617.659 --> 4622.639999999999
about this [ __ ]

4620.179 --> 4624.7390000000005
because I already made my point how he

4622.64 --> 4628.659000000001
was wrong I explained it on the Flat

4624.739 --> 4628.659
Earth debate very concisely

4628.76 --> 4634.280000000001
and people know I'm right about it

4632.36 --> 4636.44
I don't care

4634.28 --> 4638.659
I don't care if he wants to hold on to

4636.44 --> 4641.86
his mistake it's his freaking problem

4638.659 --> 4641.86
his track record

4643.76 --> 4647.2390000000005
and by the way that's another example

4645.679 --> 4651.14
turret

4647.239 --> 4653.12
yeah even on the Flat Earth debates yeah

4651.14 --> 4655.88
they get it wrong

4653.12 --> 4658.76
there's proof right here as an example

4655.88 --> 4664.159000000001
they get it wrong

4658.76 --> 4664.159000000001
see tarot not 100 correct

4666.08 --> 4671.239
they get things wrong and then they hold

4668.78 --> 4675.32
on to it still happens

4671.239 --> 4677.78
it happens to literally the best of us

4675.32 --> 4680.599999999999
and that's the best of us right that's

4677.78 --> 4682.88
not the general flat earthers out there

4680.6 --> 4685.400000000001
they get a lot more wrong

4682.88 --> 4687.14
and nobody even tells them they're wrong

4685.4 --> 4690.379999999999
except for Ballers and then they don't

4687.14 --> 4692.659000000001
listen so the Ballers can feel oh see I

4690.38 --> 4694.82
knew that Ballers were smarter because

4692.659 --> 4698.78
the flat earthers making an error and

4694.82 --> 4701.0
he's not even seeing it yes because they

4698.78 --> 4704.84
love to do that

4701.0 --> 4707.54
yeah to them that's like milking cows

4704.84 --> 4711.1990000000005
seeing a flatter make a mistake and not

4707.54 --> 4714.38
realize it they love that they literally

4711.199 --> 4717.94
squirt all over their clothes

4714.38 --> 4717.9400000000005
for that [ __ ] yeah

4718.4 --> 4721.639999999999
because flat earthers do get things

4720.5 --> 4723.8
wrong

4721.64 --> 4726.219
and it's really [ __ ] annoying when

4723.8 --> 4726.219
that happens

4731.239 --> 4736.759999999999
and then baller squared over it again

4734.3 --> 4738.7390000000005
because they feel like oh see there's

4736.76 --> 4740.42
we're Superior because they made

4738.739 --> 4742.58
mistakes

4740.42 --> 4744.9800000000005
overlooking that they make like a

4742.58 --> 4747.199
hundred thousand times more mistakes

4744.98 --> 4750.678999999999
continually

4747.199 --> 4752.839999999999
Miss like Cascade

4750.679 --> 4754.88
mistakes

4752.84 --> 4757.28
like one resting on top of another on

4754.88 --> 4760.04
top of another on top of another such

4757.28 --> 4761.98
elaborate mistakes that literally like

4760.04 --> 4766.82
even an expert will have trouble

4761.98 --> 4769.459999999999
dissecting how that error has cascaded

4766.82 --> 4772.099999999999
yeah that's how many mistakes Ballers

4769.46 --> 4774.7390000000005
make or they'll Overlook that and then

4772.1 --> 4776.120000000001
they'll squirt over when flat earthers

4774.739 --> 4778.5199999999995
say stupid things

4776.12 --> 4781.28
that they're incorrect about and I think

4778.52 --> 4783.080000000001
that they are superior again

4781.28 --> 4783.98
that's what Ballers do that's all they

4783.08 --> 4786.44
got

4783.98 --> 4788.659
but they keep doing it and if flat

4786.44 --> 4792.259999999999
earthers just are a bunch of

4788.659 --> 4795.199
overconfident blabber mouths that

4792.26 --> 4798.02
continually get things wrong and double

4795.199 --> 4799.879999999999
down on it because we're a flat Earth or

4798.02 --> 4801.38
we can't be wrong yeah then you're a

4799.88 --> 4804.679
[ __ ] [ __ ]

4801.38 --> 4806.8
and you are literally reinforcing

4804.679 --> 4809.96
encouraging

4806.8 --> 4814.76
boosting morale

4809.96 --> 4817.28
of the Ballers yeah you get it

4814.76 --> 4821.6
when you make an error as a flat earther

4817.28 --> 4823.58
in the face of a baller you boost their

4821.6 --> 4825.679
morale yeah

4823.58 --> 4828.5599999999995
oh you think doesn't mean anything yeah

4825.679 --> 4831.5
yeah yeah it does

4828.56 --> 4834.38
that's how they can still win they can't

4831.5 --> 4838.719
win the argument but they can win over

4834.38 --> 4844.179
Us by letting us become sloppy idiots

4838.719 --> 4844.179
that are undeservedly overconfident

4844.4 --> 4849.139999999999
and just because you think you're on the

4846.86 --> 4850.699
right side you can just say whatever you

4849.14 --> 4852.08
want and be right about it because the

4850.699 --> 4853.58
globe's always wrong yeah guess what

4852.08 --> 4857.9
you're going to look like a complete

4853.58 --> 4861.08
[ __ ] [ __ ] the exact type of [ __ ]

4857.9 --> 4863.12
that the Ballers like to portray flat

4861.08 --> 4866.12
earthers with you'll probably get more

4863.12 --> 4870.14
hits on YouTube that way yeah how

4866.12 --> 4872.3
because you're a [ __ ] scumbag making

4870.14 --> 4875.62
Flat Earth look bad

4872.3 --> 4875.62
that's why

4879.88 --> 4887.92
FTD is not full of Errors [ __ ]

named that I literally just is that the

extent of your knowledge

4919.76 --> 4924.38
you know about it because I just told

you so if I wouldn't have brought it up

4924.38 --> 4928.34
you wouldn't even know because you're

4926.36 --> 4932.739
that [ __ ] stupid

4928.34 --> 4932.7390000000005
you don't even know anything

4933.02 --> 4939.400000000001

4978.679 --> 4983.42
[ __ ] [ __ ]

4981.199 --> 4985.879999999999
it's [ __ ] tarot do you understand

4983.42 --> 4988.04
that that makes you look [ __ ] it

4985.88 --> 4991.52
makes you look like a 12 year old

4988.04 --> 4995.26
yeah because that's what 12 year olds do

4991.52 --> 4998.42
100 right you're 100 wrong

4995.26 --> 5000.360000000001
what you're gonna be the next Tate

4998.42 --> 5003.04
you want to be a [ __ ] like that

5000.36 --> 5005.38
overblowing everything to just make you

5003.04 --> 5008.14
look like an overconfident pompous

5005.38 --> 5011.02
[ __ ] because that is what that makes

5008.14 --> 5013.0
you look like Tarot I'm telling you this

5011.02 --> 5016.56
because I care about you

5013.0 --> 5016.56
it just makes you look stupid

5021.219 --> 5025.179
it doesn't matter if you're trying to

5023.38 --> 5027.4800000000005
address a global it makes you look

5025.179 --> 5027.4800000000005
stupid

5029.34 --> 5036.3
there is no 100 right 100 wrong that

5033.64 --> 5036.3
doesn't exist

5037.3 --> 5042.58
like this as soon as you say that as

5039.82 --> 5045.46
soon the second you say that

5042.58 --> 5046.78
the the one claimed to be 100 right will

5045.46 --> 5049.06
make an error

5046.78 --> 5051.58
and the second you say that the one

5049.06 --> 5053.080000000001
claimed to be 100 wrong will say

5051.58 --> 5056.32
something correct

5053.08 --> 5059.32
why because they can and because it's

5056.32 --> 5061.9
wrong because such a statement is always

5059.32 --> 5063.639999999999
wrong you understand

5061.9 --> 5066.099999999999
and now I'm doing it

5063.64 --> 5068.7390000000005
saying it's always wrong and thereby I

5066.1 --> 5072.0
might actually negate that statement

5068.739 --> 5072.0
but you get my point

5073.12 --> 5078.36
it doesn't work like that

5075.4 --> 5078.36
foreign

5087.88 --> 5090.78
lies

5094.179 --> 5099.58
why are you using the word lies

5097.179 --> 5102.58
stop we were talking about errors

5099.58 --> 5104.94
mistakes a lie has an own another layer

5102.58 --> 5104.94
to it

5111.94 --> 5115.36
right if somebody's just going by what

5114.1 --> 5117.46
they were taught

5115.36 --> 5120.659
and what they were taught is incorrect

5117.46 --> 5120.659
does that mean they're lying

5121.42 --> 5124.08
no

5128.38 --> 5134.1990000000005
no it is it's over exaggeration

5131.679 --> 5136.42
oversimplification

5134.199 --> 5139.54
is what simpletons do

5136.42 --> 5141.88
don't be a simpleton tear it don't over

5139.54 --> 5145.179
exaggerate

5141.88 --> 5148.0
don't over generalize don't

5145.179 --> 5150.76
turn it into ones and zeros it's stupid

5148.0 --> 5153.9
it's ineffective it'll make you lose

5150.76 --> 5153.900000000001
subtle oversight

5155.04 --> 5159.699
just don't do it

5157.3 --> 5162.34
it's no point doing that

5159.699 --> 5166.0199999999995
it's not gonna change whatever the

5162.34 --> 5166.02
Ballers are doing ever

5166.92 --> 5171.4
there's no point in having that attitude

5169.6 --> 5173.92
at all

5171.4 --> 5177.48
just making you look like you're young

5173.92 --> 5177.4800000000005
and you don't have control over yourself

5177.659 --> 5186.459

they're trying to dissect and over

5202.78 --> 5205.62
analyze no

5205.84 --> 5209.38
I'm over analyzing

5209.38 --> 5215.86
I analyze you I've been analyzing you

we talk

you show how you do things I'm trying to

5222.34 --> 5230.58
help you out by pointing out something

[Music]

5241.96 --> 5247.719
yeah but that's fine that's not what you

5245.86 --> 5249.639
were talking about though that's not the

5247.719 --> 5252.76
way you were talking

5249.639 --> 5255.88
that's just a logical thing yeah of

5267.88 --> 5274.06

5270.76 --> 5277.360000000001
Glovers too I mean there's been globers

5274.06 --> 5280.179
in this chat for a very long time

5277.36 --> 5282.46
that say good things and even have like

5280.179 --> 5283.54
good advice sometimes and then I'll take

5282.46 --> 5287.02
it

5283.54 --> 5291.12
so it's just not true

5287.02 --> 5291.120000000001
over generalization again

5291.699 --> 5298.239
I mean you might do that but that's you

5295.139 --> 5301.4800000000005
extremifying things for yourself

5298.239 --> 5303.699
creating that polarized Rift

5303.699 --> 5306.0599999999995

5380.5 --> 5385.44
realize that about him but he does

5382.36 --> 5385.44
actually get people

he has a talent for that anyway

you just want to do that do you you just

5448.9 --> 5454.0599999999995
want to be that 12 year old

talking in my chat though

5531.219 --> 5537.58
much on your side when it comes to Flat

5533.26 --> 5541.719
Earth I know I know what you mean

5537.58 --> 5544.239
but what I'm concerned about is just the

5541.719 --> 5546.4
way you're talking

5544.239 --> 5548.86
and what that points at

5546.4 --> 5552.04
as to how you're thinking that's the

5548.86 --> 5554.38
part I'm trying to address not whether

5552.04 --> 5555.94
you are technically correct in five

5554.38 --> 5557.92
arguments and he wasn't or something

5555.94 --> 5560.5599999999995
that's not what I don't care about that

5557.92 --> 5562.86
it's not about that

5560.56 --> 5565.54
I mean yes but they're full

5562.86 --> 5568.96
if there was any conversation between

5565.54 --> 5571.0
Ballers and flat earthers and I had not

5568.96 --> 5573.639
tuned in at all

5571.0 --> 5576.34
not heard a single word from either side

5573.639 --> 5578.679
yes of course I'm immediately gonna

5576.34 --> 5580.84
assume that the Ballers are talking

5578.679 --> 5584.159
[ __ ] and the flat earthers are doing

5580.84 --> 5584.159000000001
their best to try and correct it

5585.46 --> 5591.4
right in that sense yeah I'm a biased

5588.4 --> 5594.58
but that's bias based on experience but

5591.4 --> 5596.08
I'm not gonna do however say oh flat

5594.58 --> 5599.5
earthers are always a hundred percent

5596.08 --> 5602.26
right and Ballers are always 100 wrong

5599.5 --> 5604.0
because that is just stupid it's a

5602.26 --> 5607.12
stupid thing to say it doesn't matter

5604.0 --> 5609.1
why it's always a stupid thing to say

5607.12 --> 5611.62
you get it always

5609.1 --> 5614.139
always stupid to say that it doesn't

5611.62 --> 5617.0199999999995
matter how much it is right it's just

5614.139 --> 5619.67
stupid to say that always

5631.36 --> 5636.699
by the way rumpus used to do that too

5633.639 --> 5639.639
remember yeah you might not

5636.699 --> 5641.919999999999
made him look really stupid too

5639.639 --> 5643.2390000000005
it was hysterical

5641.92 --> 5646.36
to me

5643.239 --> 5648.459999999999
so think about it like that if rump is

5646.36 --> 5649.679
saying oh we're always 100 wrong you're

5648.46 --> 5652.0
always 100

out coming onto the Flat Earth debates

5657.04 --> 5662.32
like that yeah

5659.08 --> 5665.26
me the opposition thought that was

5662.32 --> 5668.0199999999995
hysterical it literally made me laugh

5665.26 --> 5671.34
out loud every every time he did that

5668.02 --> 5675.219
yeah so now think about it

5671.34 --> 5678.400000000001
you're saying that turret

5675.219 --> 5683.4
I think there's a decent chance that our

freaking adult dude

5808.96 --> 5814.679
you're an adult

now get a grip

don't backtrack

5863.56 --> 5868.719

you need to just take it to heart stop

5871.6 --> 5877.3
saying misquoting me that's not what I'm

5874.36 --> 5880.5599999999995
stop making excuses and just accept the

5877.3 --> 5880.56
analysis for what it is

5885.52 --> 5890.9800000000005
you made half the show about this

5889.12 --> 5893.0199999999995
oh I did too

5890.98 --> 5896.138999999999
is because you're constantly bracing

5893.02 --> 5898.360000000001
against it stop doing that it's true you

5896.139 --> 5899.92
did that you typically do that and I

5898.36 --> 5902.759999999999
tried to warn you about it and then

5899.92 --> 5905.56
you're complaining to me how I'm

5902.76 --> 5907.900000000001
misquoting you

5905.56 --> 5911.580000000001
like what the [ __ ] that's that's a straw

5907.9 --> 5911.58
man it's not about this

5916.96 --> 5920.7390000000005
it's a silly topic to argue yeah yes it

5919.84 --> 5923.92
is

5920.739 --> 5926.199
so just listen to what I meant

5923.92 --> 5930.1
yeah

5926.199 --> 5933.659
tenancy of over polarization you do that

5930.1 --> 5933.659000000001
it's not good for you though

5934.179 --> 5938.5
I know

5935.679 --> 5940.84
I used to be a little bit like that too

5938.5 --> 5943.96
not as much as you though God

5940.84 --> 5947.38
you're worse than that but it's part of

5943.96 --> 5950.86
who you are but still it's not good it's

5947.38 --> 5951.6990000000005
not good for the community when you do

5950.86 --> 5954.639
that

5951.699 --> 5957.219
it makes you look stupid as a flat

5954.639 --> 5959.02
earther even if your arguments are

5957.219 --> 5961.6
technically correct it still makes you

5959.02 --> 5963.280000000001
look stupid that was the point even

5961.6 --> 5966.04
others in the chat have been trying to

5963.28 --> 5968.219
communicate this as I have and you keep

5966.04 --> 5972.699
avoiding it

5968.219 --> 5977.86
evading it like a baller

5972.699 --> 5979.839999999999
being pushed to admit they were wrong

5977.86 --> 5982.299999999999
that's what you're doing right now

5979.84 --> 5984.34
turret

5982.3 --> 5986.92
although you seem to be kind of die

5984.34 --> 5989.32
letting it go a little but

5986.92 --> 5992.62
I mean seriously you gotta realize

5989.32 --> 5995.08
people are analyzing you too it's not

5992.62 --> 5996.639
just you analyzing other people they're

5995.08 --> 5998.199
seeing what you're doing and how you're

5996.639 --> 6001.400000000001
doing it

5998.199 --> 6001.4
you gotta present

6003.239 --> 6007.159
anyway I'm rounding out to show

6009.84 --> 6017.42
no tear it no you're wrong

6013.56 --> 6017.42
that's absolutely wrong

6022.98 --> 6027.12
yeah you can be technically correct

6025.26 --> 6030.84
that's really cool and all

6027.12 --> 6033.84
but if everybody thinks you're an idiot

6030.84 --> 6036.54
then how are you communicating the

6033.84 --> 6039.719
information how are you transferring the

6036.54 --> 6042.3
lesson you want

6039.719 --> 6044.94
so what the [ __ ] is the point of even

6042.3 --> 6047.820000000001
being correct if you're gonna say it in

6044.94 --> 6050.36
a way that nobody's gonna listen to

6047.82 --> 6050.36
see

6050.639 --> 6056.12
it doesn't work it's just your arrogance

6053.699 --> 6056.12
then

6065.88 --> 6073.1990000000005
right I spent a lot of effort

6069.26 --> 6076.92
refining my communication skills

6073.199 --> 6081.44
why because that's what's needed to

6076.92 --> 6081.4400000000005
bring across complicated messages

6081.84 --> 6087.54
because people brace against them not

6084.84 --> 6088.860000000001
you and you're doing it a little

6087.54 --> 6091.62
but

6088.86 --> 6093.12
others even worse like that are on the

6091.62 --> 6094.619
opponent's side

6093.12 --> 6097.98
right

6094.619 --> 6101.219
you need to get it right you need to see

6097.98 --> 6103.799999999999
this about yourself to not over polarize

6101.219 --> 6106.199
the situation because just because your

6103.8 --> 6108.06
feelings like it that way

6106.199 --> 6111.0
because it is that's what that is that's

6108.06 --> 6112.9800000000005
your feelings and I know it is tarot

6111.0 --> 6116.639
that's your feelings

6112.98 --> 6117.659
wanting it that way wanting it black and

6116.639 --> 6121.7390000000005
white

6117.659 --> 6124.199
Hero Devil that's how you want that's

6121.739 --> 6127.5599999999995
what that is that's that polarizing

6124.199 --> 6129.599999999999
effect every time you push that that is

6127.56 --> 6131.639
what is behind it I know it is because

6129.6 --> 6133.08
that's how it works it's how it worked

6131.639 --> 6136.08
with me too

6133.08 --> 6136.08
foreign

6139.37 --> 6146.639
[Music]

6143.6 --> 6148.3
at the show so I guess that's that's

6146.639 --> 6150.06
what this show is about

6148.3 --> 6153.54
[Music]

6150.06 --> 6156.54
no idea what the title is

6153.54 --> 6158.82
I mean I'm not gonna title it

6156.54 --> 6160.86
terabyte is not a hundred percent right

6158.82 --> 6162.0599999999995
and Ballers are not a hundred percent

6160.86 --> 6165.44
wrong

6162.06 --> 6165.4400000000005
that would be kind of silly

6170.4 --> 6174.9
right exactly fighter Sage that I'm so

6173.34 --> 6175.860000000001
glad that you guys are getting my point

6174.9 --> 6179.04
at least

6175.86 --> 6181.92
I mean Taryn is very Headstrong

6179.04 --> 6184.739
and I kind of like him for that too but

6181.92 --> 6187.5
it has risks

6184.739 --> 6191.04
over polarization is one of those risks

6187.5 --> 6193.44
and it's gonna end badly

6191.04 --> 6196.139
trust me it will

6193.44 --> 6199.44
you gotta let that go as much as you can

6196.139 --> 6201.42
anyway thanks everyone for coming it's

6199.44 --> 6202.879999999999
been kind of a Rowdy show but at least

6201.42 --> 6206.1
it was in a better mood than yesterday

6202.88 --> 6207.659000000001
that's blatantly obvious

6206.1 --> 6209.88
uh

6207.659 --> 6211.98

when going out for gross it's dry again

6240.06 --> 6244.080000000001

6241.38 --> 6246.42
so I'm gonna go quickly I'm gonna try to

6244.08 --> 6248.76
find a new webcam hopefully they'll work

6246.42 --> 6250.86
out otherwise I I think I could do with

6248.76 --> 6253.38
this kind of low frame rate shitty

6250.86 --> 6257.46
webcam for a while but yeah it's I can't

6253.38 --> 6259.7390000000005
really give weather reports with this

6257.46 --> 6261.9
so that's yeah

6259.739 --> 6264.839999999999
I hope I'll be able to find a good

6261.9 --> 6266.82
webcam right so anyway I'll be back
