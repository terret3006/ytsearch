so the weather today is

123.759 --> 129.119
kind of the same as yesterday clouded

126.32 --> 132.16
windy

129.119 --> 132.16
not rainy

132.64 --> 137.44
but yeah it's been like that all night

137.52 --> 140.84
kind of restless

144.0 --> 150.0
i had a lot of triples

145.92 --> 150.0
a lot of trouble sleeping this night

151.519 --> 155.12
and a lot of trouble getting up

155.44 --> 158.4
there was all kinds of

159.76 --> 165.28
working noises coming from downstairs

162.0 --> 169.2
again also so it's just i don't know

165.28 --> 169.2
i'm not in peak condition right now

173.28 --> 177.84
hello backs first in chat good to see

175.68 --> 177.84
you

179.44 --> 186.2
it is wednesday the 9th of june february

183.2 --> 186.2
2022

190.48 --> 192.879
all right

193.84 --> 198.959
i'm gonna see to it

195.68 --> 202.84
that tonight i don't go to bed too late

198.959 --> 202.84
because it kind of sucked

218.48 --> 224.92
likewise uh you had that same

221.68 --> 227.97
type of night

224.92 --> 227.97
[Music]

233.2 --> 237.51899999999998
it's like yeah what it kind of feels

235.439 --> 240.0
like it's like my regeneration process

237.519 --> 242.0
has only got like halfway or three at

240.0 --> 243.84
three quarters or something

242.0 --> 245.519
but i know that

243.84 --> 248.159
like probably at the end of the show

245.519 --> 250.64000000000001
i'll be like back at 100 usually goes

248.159 --> 250.64
that way

250.94 --> 253.879
[Music]

253.68 --> 253.87900000000002
all hmm

257.359 --> 261.0
oh logan's run

280.24 --> 283.24
okay

284.32 --> 288.96
oh okay

286.8 --> 292.08
yeah it is sometimes easy to

288.96 --> 292.08
misunderstand each other

293.68 --> 297.68
and i also forget that there's a bit of

295.44 --> 298.8
a delay

297.68 --> 301.44
for when

298.8 --> 302.96000000000004
yeah what i do here on camera and on on

301.44 --> 305.44
the mic actually

302.96 --> 308.59999999999997
comes in with a bit of delay

305.44 --> 308.6
on youtube

311.44 --> 316.32
anyway

313.919 --> 316.32
all right

316.72 --> 321.44000000000005
a great night okay well good to hear

320.0 --> 323.52
oh

321.44 --> 325.84
i was very entertained in the night as

323.52 --> 325.84
well

326.56 --> 329.6
watch the movie

330.24 --> 334.72
although yeah the movie was kind of dark

336.32 --> 339.8
was uh

345.44 --> 351.28
wow oh by the way hello nathan oakley

348.88 --> 353.759
good to see you

351.28 --> 356.71999999999997
man my voice

353.759 --> 356.72
that's so annoying

364.4 --> 371.12
all right

366.4 --> 374.12
uh was i saying yeah watch the movie

371.12 --> 374.12
can't

382.08 --> 385.28
what was it called again

392.639 --> 395.639
what

402.96 --> 406.56
oh yeah i was called knowing

406.88 --> 409.84
with um

410.96 --> 417.19899999999996
actor that i for some reason can't

413.199 --> 417.199
remember his name which is kind of silly

420.639 --> 427.40000000000003
oh

422.16 --> 427.40000000000003
just go figure it out on the long route

435.2 --> 438.31
[Music]

440.639 --> 443.639
um

450.88 --> 457.52
oh yeah nicholas cage that's the one

453.68 --> 457.52
that's from 2009 huh

460.479 --> 465.12
right this is it's a weird movie

463.12 --> 467.919
weird little movie i just bumped into it

465.12 --> 467.919
on netflix

469.199 --> 473.28000000000003
it's kind of hard to find something

470.96 --> 475.12
interesting on netflix

473.28 --> 476.15999999999997
something that i had not

475.12 --> 478.0
that like

476.16 --> 481.52000000000004
which i you have no clue what it's

478.0 --> 481.52
really going to be about too much

487.12 --> 493.039
hey gaining wisdom

489.44 --> 496.52
the big groot family

493.039 --> 496.52
lilia logs

517.279 --> 520.4399999999999
all right

523.519 --> 530.24
right but it was kind of like a

526.56 --> 530.2399999999999
very cryptic and dark

530.64 --> 535.8389999999999
like

532.839 --> 536.9590000000001
cassandra type like knowing the future

535.839 --> 539.12
and then

536.959 --> 540.16
not being able to change it and then

539.12 --> 542.8
also

540.16 --> 546.12
sort of aliens this is

542.8 --> 546.12
really weird

556.32 --> 560.88
all right in a way was kind of like look

558.64 --> 564.0
don't look up except less of a social

560.88 --> 567.36
commentary more of a dark story

564.0 --> 568.16
no meteor but a solar flare it's like

567.36 --> 570.399
yeah

568.16 --> 572.64
i'm doesn't really spoil much to say

570.399 --> 572.64
that

572.8 --> 577.8389999999999
but also aliens

574.72 --> 579.9200000000001
it's like a lot of the scenes

577.839 --> 581.7600000000001
it's yeah it's almost like i recognize

579.92 --> 584.16
don't look up which is kind of odd since

581.76 --> 586.56
this movie came from

584.16 --> 589.36
well long time ago

586.56 --> 591.8389999999999
over a decade

589.36 --> 591.839
i don't know

595.36 --> 600.32
but i thought it was kind of interesting

598.56 --> 602.399
it was like

600.32 --> 605.2
obviously a written

602.399 --> 609.04
sci-fi type story

605.2 --> 610.399
but it was kind of entertaining overall

609.04 --> 613.4399999999999
like that

610.399 --> 615.6
it's a bit of a thriller a bit of sci-fi

613.44 --> 618.1600000000001
and like this

615.6 --> 619.44
figuring out a doom puzzle pretty much

618.16 --> 622.8
anyway

619.44 --> 622.8000000000001
right so that's what i watched

623.2 --> 628.1600000000001
and

624.079 --> 628.16
of course videos and youtube

630.72 --> 637.0400000000001
oh yeah kiwi alive

633.279 --> 637.04
but yes just stuck to the chat

637.2 --> 641.2
i was mostly talking about food again

642.8 --> 649.04
people even giving their testimony about

645.279 --> 649.04
oh thank you for the food tip so

649.4 --> 652.429
[Music]

658.839 --> 663.839
right oh has had anybody already checked

662.24 --> 667.12
out

663.839 --> 670.5600000000001
debunking the flat kitchen video

667.12 --> 670.5600000000001
from refracted curvature

671.6 --> 676.32
you gotta check it out it's

673.36 --> 676.32
it's really funny

681.519 --> 685.0
here's the link

688.0 --> 691.0
um

707.6 --> 710.6
uh

716.8 --> 719.04
right

720.48 --> 723.36
oh yeah i also been watching some own

722.24 --> 725.6
benjamin

723.36 --> 725.6
he's

725.76 --> 729.76
he's gone on to the rogan

729.839 --> 734.8000000000001
he's found a new angle of approach for

732.48 --> 737.76
rogan he isn't white

734.8 --> 737.76
he's italian

738.639 --> 742.44
it's hilarious kinda

744.88 --> 750.16
in a funny but yet terrible video

747.92 --> 751.279
that he found somewhere of some stand-up

750.16 --> 753.6
chick

751.279 --> 754.48
that's then like literally bragging

753.6 --> 756.88
about

754.48 --> 759.12
getting the jabs and oh i'm so i'm still

756.88 --> 761.279
so unharmed and then right as she

759.12 --> 764.639
finishes up the joke she just passes out

761.279 --> 764.639
on stage it's just like

766.72 --> 769.72
damn

772.88 --> 777.0
i'll give you that one too

786.0 --> 792.519
right so anyway

788.24 --> 792.519
what have you all been up to

807.12 --> 810.32
right so yeah also since nathan oakley

809.2 --> 813.279
is in chat

810.32 --> 815.839
like the relay like prediction

813.279 --> 818.56
we have to be careful not to let victory

815.839 --> 818.5600000000001
defeat us

820.0 --> 826.0
right because i think that we have now

823.12 --> 828.5600000000001
definitely reached that point

826.0 --> 831.76
in the yeah figuring out

828.56 --> 831.76
flat earth and physics

832.639 --> 839.6800000000001
where like yeah we literally mastered

836.16 --> 841.8389999999999
the design pretty much we mastered

839.68 --> 843.3599999999999
like the machinations from the baller

841.839 --> 845.519
side and

843.36 --> 847.6
like we can now literally just start

845.519 --> 852.24
predicting exactly how they're going to

847.6 --> 854.639
build machinations about what and how

852.24 --> 856.48
right so that means basically absolute

854.639 --> 857.76
and total victory

856.48 --> 859.76
but

857.76 --> 860.88
what do you do

859.76 --> 863.4399999999999
with that

860.88 --> 865.4399999999999
after that

863.44 --> 869.519
because most time most of the time

865.44 --> 870.72
victory makes everybody too comfortable

869.519 --> 871.92
it

870.72 --> 873.9200000000001
causes

871.92 --> 876.4799999999999
people to not

873.92 --> 878.399
be as trained and sharp anymore because

876.48 --> 880.24
there's no more training because there's

878.399 --> 881.36
no more battle because you've won

880.24 --> 882.9590000000001
everything

881.36 --> 885.839
right it's like

882.959 --> 888.16
a great warrior king

885.839 --> 890.9590000000001
ascending to the throne and dealing with

888.16 --> 892.56
wars of his country and then all works

890.959 --> 894.959
it all works and he's just this

892.56 --> 896.959
magnificent glorious king and everybody

894.959 --> 899.4399999999999
worships him

896.959 --> 901.76
and then he gets fat and dies of a heart

899.44 --> 901.7600000000001
attack

902.24 --> 908.0790000000001
because literally they has no more

904.639 --> 910.639
enemies and he's just like what do i do

908.079 --> 912.399
people are just bringing me food because

910.639 --> 914.72
they worship me and

912.399 --> 914.72
yeah

915.519 --> 921.76
right don't let victory defeat you

919.04 --> 924.0
i think that's a valid prediction i'd

921.76 --> 926.88
like to hand out to

924.0 --> 927.68
nathan oakley and fed

926.88 --> 930.079
right

927.68 --> 932.959
because do not underestimate how much

930.079 --> 935.5999999999999
we've actually won

932.959 --> 937.5189999999999
right we already kind of won

935.6 --> 939.6
with the black swan

937.519 --> 941.519
and before that even a bit but with the

939.6 --> 943.839
black swan definitely that was like the

941.519 --> 945.44
first death blow that's when the tide

943.839 --> 948.48
totally changed

945.44 --> 948.48
and then the sexton

950.0 --> 955.36
sexton then

952.0 --> 957.36
yeah really showed how things work on a

955.36 --> 959.04
flat earth really

957.36 --> 960.72
practically

959.04 --> 962.8
and now

960.72 --> 963.759
in the final stages we're figuring out

962.8 --> 967.5999999999999
like

963.759 --> 970.9590000000001
the map projecting itself

967.6 --> 970.9590000000001
and like how it's done

971.839 --> 975.0400000000001
cartography

973.199 --> 977.199
right and there's just nothing left

975.04 --> 979.759
after that point there's like

977.199 --> 979.7589999999999
we've won

981.12 --> 986.5600000000001
the cherry is on top of the cake

983.839 --> 986.5600000000001
at this point

986.639 --> 989.6800000000001
so what do we do

989.92 --> 994.959
with the victory it's important to think

992.639 --> 994.9590000000001
about

995.04 --> 1001.4399999999999
right well my personal

997.759 --> 1002.72
goal would be to kind of like okay let's

1001.44 --> 1004.1600000000001
become

1002.72 --> 1005.519
scientists

1004.16 --> 1008.56
right let's

1005.519 --> 1011.6
let's test things that's why i'm like

1008.56 --> 1014.079
my pursuit is the light i'm pursuing the

1011.6 --> 1016.639
light and figuring out what is it

1014.079 --> 1018.959
and they have to show yesterday you guys

1016.639 --> 1022.16
nathan especially was all

1018.959 --> 1025.56
like oh this is all ridiculous and

1022.16 --> 1025.56
and even adam

1025.6 --> 1029.6
but

1026.4 --> 1032.4
yeah refracted curvature and me

1029.6 --> 1034.799
we have made up our minds to test this

1032.4 --> 1037.76
concept that i thought up

1034.799 --> 1039.6
like 30 years ago

1037.76 --> 1041.76
and figure out whether there is any

1039.6 --> 1044.24
legitimacy to it because if there is

1041.76 --> 1045.36
there's like a whole

1044.24 --> 1046.48
range

1045.36 --> 1049.12
of

1046.48 --> 1052.88
even conceptual exploration even of

1049.12 --> 1054.799
mathematical redefining reconfiguring of

1052.88 --> 1056.72
the nature of light so there is like

1054.799 --> 1058.96
more to be figured out

1056.72 --> 1061.6000000000001
but when it comes to flat earth yeah

1058.96 --> 1064.4
it's it's a done deal

1061.6 --> 1067.6789999999999
right so what you move on beyond that

1064.4 --> 1070.72
what do you explore

1067.679 --> 1072.88
i want to explore the light

1070.72 --> 1074.88
i'm very interested in the celestials

1072.88 --> 1077.6000000000001
that's a light based

1074.88 --> 1079.5200000000002
phenomenon

1077.6 --> 1082.32
and just the very

1079.52 --> 1083.36
nature of like what is the minimum of

1082.32 --> 1085.9189999999999
life

1083.36 --> 1088.559
so yeah i'm after the light that's my

1085.919 --> 1093.88
continuation project that's how i will

1088.559 --> 1093.8799999999999
attempt to not let victory defeat me

1097.28 --> 1099.52
right

1100.64 --> 1104.4
anyway let's get back to the chat

1105.44 --> 1110.72
can we now move on to germ theory oh god

1113.2 --> 1116.799
well yeah germ theory but

1118.32 --> 1122.72
that's something for the world

1120.4 --> 1124.799
right the problem is with germ theory

1122.72 --> 1126.799
and to test it out you have to actually

1124.799 --> 1129.44
use participants

1126.799 --> 1132.0
that makes it a lot more complicated

1129.44 --> 1134.8400000000001
like a lot more complicated judicially

1132.0 --> 1136.799
especially you know that

1134.84 --> 1139.799
so

1136.799 --> 1139.799
right

1150.4 --> 1155.76
the chapters there is somebody who jab

1152.799 --> 1158.08
without yes

1155.76 --> 1160.32
or rather that

1158.08 --> 1161.6789999999999
just figured out this is not

1160.32 --> 1163.6789999999999
this is not

1161.679 --> 1165.6000000000001
what the propaganda mainstream

1163.679 --> 1166.72
propaganda and the government say it is

1165.6 --> 1170.32
that

1166.72 --> 1173.72
that would be a job the truther i guess

1170.32 --> 1173.72
video logs

1188.559 --> 1192.96
fb is not

1190.08 --> 1194.1599999999999
until accepted by me what by smurf

1192.96 --> 1196.08
science

1194.16 --> 1198.0
professor phil bell

1196.08 --> 1200.0
uh no smurf sign's never going to

1198.0 --> 1202.08
relinquish its position

1200.0 --> 1204.4
that's the whole point that's why it's

1202.08 --> 1205.4399999999998
been doing what it's been doing because

1204.4 --> 1206.48
it's not

1205.44 --> 1208.48
willing

1206.48 --> 1210.48
nor will it ever

1208.48 --> 1212.559
maneuver to a position where it's just

1210.48 --> 1214.96
gonna

1212.559 --> 1214.96
give in

1217.84 --> 1224.3999999999999
it's not done no no we are done

1221.2 --> 1226.24
we're done we've completed the journey

1224.4 --> 1230.48
pretty much

1226.24 --> 1232.159
and yeah the baller earth the ball earth

1230.48 --> 1235.679
is never going to complete its journey

1232.159 --> 1238.3200000000002
because it refuses to be informed about

1235.679 --> 1241.2800000000002
reality

1238.32 --> 1244.0
so yeah the globe earth is never done

1241.28 --> 1246.08
the flat earth it's yeah there's still

1244.0 --> 1247.52
more details to be figured out right

1246.08 --> 1249.9189999999999
yeah the

1247.52 --> 1252.1589999999999
in the world exploration of what is what

1249.919 --> 1255.6000000000001
is actually the place what what are the

1252.159 --> 1257.919
parts that we don't know for sure

1255.6 --> 1261.039
right but that's basically a side note

1257.919 --> 1263.76
to the monumental victory of the

1261.039 --> 1268.679
absolute necessity of the earth being

1263.76 --> 1268.679
flat for the globe model to even work

1284.0 --> 1290.36
all right vaccinator upset we are not

1285.84 --> 1290.36
fast yeah it's a ponzi scheme effect

1291.44 --> 1295.52
or

1292.72 --> 1298.159
pyramid scheme like the vaccination the

1295.52 --> 1301.039
effect of it is is dealt with like a

1298.159 --> 1301.0390000000002
pyramid scheme

1302.559 --> 1308.72
see that see how that works it's exactly

1306.159 --> 1310.88
like a pyramid scheme like you have oh

1308.72 --> 1313.84
you're into it okay now you have to put

1310.88 --> 1313.8400000000001
others into it

1315.44 --> 1320.72
it's a basic pyramid scheme

1318.64 --> 1323.6000000000001
and everybody's just being told oh

1320.72 --> 1324.64
everybody has to be vaccinated everybody

1323.6 --> 1327.039
then

1324.64 --> 1331.88
yeah that's what people will do it's

1327.039 --> 1331.8799999999999
exactly like a basic pyramid scheme

1332.0 --> 1337.36
except it's huge

1334.24 --> 1339.1200000000001
it's world encompassing and mega corp

1337.36 --> 1341.84
operations are the one

1339.12 --> 1341.84
performing it

1344.96 --> 1347.8400000000001
what's the point

1348.08 --> 1351.12
what's the point the point is that we

1349.919 --> 1353.5200000000002
won

1351.12 --> 1355.12
it's not about how many people think the

1353.52 --> 1356.32
earth is flat yeah this is not a

1355.12 --> 1358.6399999999999
religion

1356.32 --> 1359.52
this is a matter of what is actually

1358.64 --> 1362.3200000000002
true

1359.52 --> 1364.8799999999999
not what everybody believes

1362.32 --> 1367.2
yeah even if we would at some point get

1364.88 --> 1369.44
people to believe

1367.2 --> 1371.44
a certain model or whatever

1369.44 --> 1372.88
it's completely useless

1371.44 --> 1375.52
you know why

1372.88 --> 1377.679
because they're not really all that

1375.52 --> 1378.72
interested on average they're just gonna

1377.679 --> 1381.919
either

1378.72 --> 1384.159
artistify it like make their own fantasy

1381.919 --> 1385.76
stuff out of it again

1384.159 --> 1390.4
they'll lose interest

1385.76 --> 1390.4
and just do other things again right

1392.48 --> 1396.64
it doesn't matter what people believe

1394.64 --> 1400.3200000000002
it's a matter of

1396.64 --> 1403.6000000000001
what do we know and how do we know it

1400.32 --> 1404.799
and how can we prove what we know

1403.6 --> 1406.7199999999998
and in that

1404.799 --> 1410.8799999999999
that specific

1406.72 --> 1413.52
game the flat earth has absolutely won

1410.88 --> 1416.0
it's not about how many people believe

1413.52 --> 1420.1589999999999
whether it is flatterable that's another

1416.0 --> 1424.0
matter that's just the psychological

1420.159 --> 1425.8400000000001
warfare situation in general waking up

1424.0 --> 1428.48
right that's the wake up process that's

1425.84 --> 1428.48
cultural

1428.88 --> 1431.8400000000001
that's not academic

1444.72 --> 1449.96
yeah hello classical homeopath

1446.96 --> 1449.96
indeed

1497.52 --> 1500.52
c

1508.159 --> 1513.7600000000002
numbers have been grown exponentially

1512.0 --> 1516.24
you may know flat earthers terror three

1513.76 --> 1516.24
or six

1525.919 --> 1531.039
all right what that is also because well

1528.64 --> 1533.2
society was a great tool to keep you

1531.039 --> 1534.8799999999999
busy and keep you distracted right

1533.2 --> 1537.2
there's always something to do or you

1534.88 --> 1539.1200000000001
walk outside and you

1537.2 --> 1540.8400000000001
walk into a bar and you have an

1539.12 --> 1544.0
adventure or you walk

1540.84 --> 1546.6399999999999
into casino you know like there was all

1544.0 --> 1549.12
this [ __ ] out there

1546.64 --> 1550.7990000000002
so for the normies it was like oh

1549.12 --> 1552.08
somebody tells you about flat earth you

1550.799 --> 1554.1589999999999
have like ah

1552.08 --> 1555.4399999999998
what the [ __ ] and then like okay let's

1554.159 --> 1558.72
go to the board

1555.44 --> 1561.3600000000001
let's get drunk and then just oh party

1558.72 --> 1563.1200000000001
meet a girl get interested and then just

1561.36 --> 1565.279
completely forget all about it right

1563.12 --> 1566.7199999999998
that's very easy that was kind of easy

1565.279 --> 1569.2
back in the day

1566.72 --> 1571.44
when society was still kind of

1569.2 --> 1573.679
functioning as a whole

1571.44 --> 1576.0800000000002
but since the lockdown he had

1573.679 --> 1577.52
people don't really have that kind of an

1576.08 --> 1580.0
escape

1577.52 --> 1582.8799999999999
opportunity like that anymore now the

1580.0 --> 1584.559
only escape was to lock down into their

1582.88 --> 1586.0
computer into their phones on the

1584.559 --> 1588.72
internet

1586.0 --> 1589.52
but yeah what fills it

1588.72 --> 1591.3600000000001
real

1589.52 --> 1594.0
dark shitty stuff

1591.36 --> 1596.9599999999998
real blands

1594.0 --> 1599.039
bland bland blends oh it's so funny i'm

1596.96 --> 1600.72
so popular stuff and

1599.039 --> 1604.24
flat earth things and like deep

1600.72 --> 1606.08
exploration deep figuring out of skills

1604.24 --> 1608.159
etc

1606.08 --> 1610.3999999999999
right

1608.159 --> 1613.5200000000002
so if that is the kind of the range to

1610.4 --> 1615.039
fall back on then on average yeah more

1613.52 --> 1617.2
people

1615.039 --> 1619.52
will end up

1617.2 --> 1622.24
learning learning skills learning also

1619.52 --> 1623.9189999999999
about flat earth it cuts some things and

1622.24 --> 1625.679
just like

1623.919 --> 1627.44
seeing

1625.679 --> 1630.88
the back and forth between ball

1627.44 --> 1633.6000000000001
believers and flat earthers

1630.88 --> 1636.0
right because they do that

1633.6 --> 1640.399
because there is no more easy quick

1636.0 --> 1643.12
escape and you forget all about it

1640.399 --> 1644.9599999999998
that has definitely caused more people

1643.12 --> 1647.4399999999998
to just

1644.96 --> 1650.3990000000001
like oh i can't really escape this

1647.44 --> 1652.0800000000002
anymore i'm just gonna now learn about

1650.399 --> 1654.9599999999998
this i guess

1652.08 --> 1659.1999999999998
it just happens

1654.96 --> 1661.44
and that's also about [ __ ] things

1659.2 --> 1663.76
not just flat earth right it could be

1661.44 --> 1666.64
down any rabbit hole trail

1663.76 --> 1670.08
could be like a more q anon type rabbit

1666.64 --> 1672.96
hole trail which is kind of yeah

1670.08 --> 1675.9189999999999
you know dubious in ways you could you

1672.96 --> 1679.679
could get yourself trapped there

1675.919 --> 1681.679
if you double down too much onto it

1679.679 --> 1684.679
although it does of course have some

1681.679 --> 1684.679
points

1696.72 --> 1701.039
hmm what are you talking about now still

1701.279 --> 1705.36
toxicity from many factors

1709.039 --> 1713.84
what what are you talking about getting

1711.44 --> 1713.8400000000001
wisdom

1722.399 --> 1729.36
the satellite industry is getting you

1724.88 --> 1732.3200000000002
mean more radio towers right

1729.36 --> 1734.559
more radiologics yeah professor field

1732.32 --> 1735.84
yeah the radiological industry is

1734.559 --> 1739.12
growing

1735.84 --> 1741.76
and it's having a very logical and

1739.12 --> 1744.7199999999998
expected and anticipated upon on an

1741.76 --> 1746.24
industrial scale

1744.72 --> 1749.279
responses

1746.24 --> 1752.48
in society both psychological as well as

1749.279 --> 1754.88
like cellular

1752.48 --> 1755.919
right because all that extra radiation

1754.88 --> 1757.8400000000001
certainly

1755.919 --> 1760.64
being everywhere has an overall

1757.84 --> 1762.399
influence on like the on the resonance

1760.64 --> 1765.64
of life

1762.399 --> 1765.6399999999999
it does

1768.0 --> 1772.08
you got to realize it's not just a bunch

1770.0 --> 1773.44
of things hanging up there doing

1772.08 --> 1774.96
something

1773.44 --> 1780.2
it's just these

1774.96 --> 1780.2
more radiological sources everywhere

1780.799 --> 1785.44
because people want their way underneath

1782.799 --> 1785.44
the internet

1789.76 --> 1793.36
because they're really [ __ ] stupid

1792.159 --> 1794.71
don't know what they're doing to

1793.36 --> 1797.789
themselves and nature

1794.71 --> 1797.789
[Music]

1804.88 --> 1808.96
these days several times a week all

1807.12 --> 1812.0
these rocket launches wow look at all

1808.96 --> 1812.0
that complete waste

1812.32 --> 1817.36
what a waste

1814.96 --> 1819.52
i mean a rocket launch can be kind of

1817.36 --> 1820.84
interesting in sort of a

1819.52 --> 1823.84
futurist

1820.84 --> 1825.12
sci-fi mindset

1823.84 --> 1827.039
right but

1825.12 --> 1829.52
to do that all the time is just a

1827.039 --> 1831.279
freaking waste

1829.52 --> 1833.2
like why

1831.279 --> 1836.399
why do you need to do that

1833.2 --> 1838.88
it's just wasted

1836.399 --> 1839.9189999999999
nothing actually is accomplished

1838.88 --> 1842.72
it's

1839.919 --> 1845.44
just a photo op that's it

1842.72 --> 1850.1200000000001
nothing actually happens because of it

1845.44 --> 1850.1200000000001
except a lot of fuel is wasted

1869.6 --> 1875.1999999999998
no they don't professor phil bill

1872.32 --> 1876.84
yeah the earth is not a ball orbit is a

1875.2 --> 1879.039
fictional

1876.84 --> 1882.08
concept when you think about it it's

1879.039 --> 1884.64
quite preposterous

1882.08 --> 1886.559
like you can never demonstrate anything

1884.64 --> 1887.44
like that

1886.559 --> 1890.84
right

1887.44 --> 1895.039
nothing nothing works like

1890.84 --> 1895.039
that it's just a concept

1895.36 --> 1898.8799999999999
there is no orbit

1900.32 --> 1904.48
there's no ball to orbit around

1904.559 --> 1909.6789999999999
and besides even the supposed satellites

1907.12 --> 1911.039
are just claimed to be geostationary

1909.679 --> 1913.6000000000001
hanging there

1911.039 --> 1915.76
so what freaking orbit

1913.6 --> 1918.0
like how can it even just hang there if

1915.76 --> 1921.279
it's not orbiting to

1918.0 --> 1923.76
to stabilize its trajectory which is a

1921.279 --> 1926.32
fictional concept on its own right

1923.76 --> 1929.12
like even within the freaking

1926.32 --> 1931.84
convention of the idea of it none of

1929.12 --> 1935.1999999999998
what's happening out there makes sense

1931.84 --> 1937.9189999999999
like a geostationary satellite makes no

1935.2 --> 1940.559
absolutely no sense just

1937.919 --> 1942.64
as a concept in general it's really like

1940.559 --> 1944.559
oh are they going to believe this

1942.64 --> 1945.8400000000001
yeah oh it's just it's just hanging

1944.559 --> 1948.399
there right

1945.84 --> 1950.9599999999998
because at first we had to make up an

1948.399 --> 1953.76
excuse as to how it could be

1950.96 --> 1955.039
falling eternally in a perfect circle

1953.76 --> 1956.64
around it

1955.039 --> 1958.08
right because otherwise yeah it fall it

1956.64 --> 1960.24
would just fall to the earth but now

1958.08 --> 1962.32
it's like oh but this one's just hanging

1960.24 --> 1964.159
there

1962.32 --> 1966.08
are they gonna notice this it's just

1964.159 --> 1967.1200000000001
hanging there oh

1966.08 --> 1969.4399999999998
yeah

1967.12 --> 1971.76
it's total nonsense

1969.44 --> 1975.279
it's not even backed up by some story of

1971.76 --> 1978.799
how that's possible it's just nonsense

1975.279 --> 1980.159
right this excuse for it geostationary

1978.799 --> 1981.9189999999999
satellites i mean

1980.159 --> 1983.6000000000001
to actually do something like that

1981.919 --> 1986.48
wouldn't even be that hard you just take

1983.6 --> 1990.48
a sat balloon

1986.48 --> 1993.3600000000001
it'll keep hanging there for a long time

1990.48 --> 1993.3600000000001
or zeppelin

1993.679 --> 1998.679
right could even fly off whatever

2004.95 --> 2009.289
[Music]

2010.0 --> 2016.0
you can see satellites oh yes of course

2013.919 --> 2019.0
you can

2016.0 --> 2019.0
sure

2020.32 --> 2024.24
can you zoom in on it can you actually

2022.399 --> 2026.2399999999998
see the features

2024.24 --> 2027.2
with your satellites

2026.24 --> 2028.799
yeah

2027.2 --> 2032.8400000000001
zoom in out there you see all these

2028.799 --> 2032.84
features of all these satellites

2033.44 --> 2037.919
oh no you don't don't you

2035.679 --> 2041.44
you just see like

2037.919 --> 2041.44
moving light blips

2043.2 --> 2046.559
right

2044.0 --> 2049.919
that's celestial it's a celestial light

2046.559 --> 2049.919
that's not actually

2050.0 --> 2055.24
a physical thing

2052.0 --> 2055.24
up there

2067.919 --> 2071.96
i can't believe that [ __ ]

2076.72 --> 2081.359
that makes absolutely no sense professor

2078.879 --> 2081.359
fieldwell

2081.599 --> 2084.48
they're orbiting

2084.879 --> 2090.7999999999997
the same speed as earth rotation

2088.639 --> 2090.8
that

2094.399 --> 2099.72
does

2095.919 --> 2099.72
that makes no sense

2102.16 --> 2105.7599999999998
how is earth rotation speed going to

2104.24 --> 2108.64
keep it up there

2105.76 --> 2110.88
exactly there that makes absolutely no

2108.64 --> 2113.1189999999997
sense

2110.88 --> 2116.48
that that's almost like suggesting that

2113.119 --> 2118.32
the centripetal force of earth spin

2116.48 --> 2119.68
at the distance is keeping it there or

2118.32 --> 2122.1600000000003
something

2119.68 --> 2125.44
like even though it's not attached to

2122.16 --> 2127.04
the earth like what the [ __ ] is going on

2125.44 --> 2131.56
professor fill bell

2127.04 --> 2131.56
if you actually thought about it

2134.64 --> 2142.24
how can an object not attach to earth

2138.4 --> 2144.8
up there move in lockstep with the earth

2142.24 --> 2147.04
rotating supposedly

2144.8 --> 2149.92
and then not fall down

2147.04 --> 2152.96
it's not attached

2149.92 --> 2156.079
it's not like on a rope being slung

2152.96 --> 2158.64
right and then it keeps its distance

2156.079 --> 2161.76
right no it's not attached

2158.64 --> 2161.7599999999998
it makes no sense

2165.52 --> 2171.68
oh look at the smiley face oh

2169.2 --> 2174.64
it's so stupid what i'm saying i'm only

2171.68 --> 2177.1189999999997
just testing the physical logic of the

2174.64 --> 2179.44
entire conception you know

2177.119 --> 2181.599
so stupid that i don't understand oh

2179.44 --> 2184.4
yeah well why don't you explain to me

2181.599 --> 2185.839
how it's actually up there when gravity

2184.4 --> 2188.079
supposedly

2185.839 --> 2189.68
even at that distance is still

2188.079 --> 2191.92
functional

2189.68 --> 2191.9199999999996
right

2193.119 --> 2197.76
that's the same gravity that supposedly

2195.04 --> 2200.4
keeps all the matter of earth into that

2197.76 --> 2202.7200000000003
ball shape

2200.4 --> 2202.7200000000003
right

2202.96 --> 2207.119
how

2204.4 --> 2209.119
is the satellite not crashing down if

2207.119 --> 2211.52
it's moving at the exact same speed as

2209.119 --> 2213.28
the supposed earth rotation and not

2211.52 --> 2215.28
being attached i mean if there was like

2213.28 --> 2216.8
a physical cable

2215.28 --> 2219.0400000000004
right

2216.8 --> 2221.119
and it would be slung around like a

2219.04 --> 2223.52
sling

2221.119 --> 2225.2000000000003
with the ear then i'd be like yeah okay

2223.52 --> 2227.2
right the centripetal force could kind

2225.2 --> 2229.1189999999997
of keep it at that distance with the

2227.2 --> 2231.68
earth rotation that it sort of makes

2229.119 --> 2233.76
sense sort of right there's no physical

2231.68 --> 2235.359
connection though

2233.76 --> 2237.119
so how the [ __ ]

2235.359 --> 2240.119
is it just staying there that makes no

2237.119 --> 2240.119
sense

2242.4 --> 2245.599
just

2243.359 --> 2248.88
a block of matter

2245.599 --> 2248.88
just floating there

2251.52 --> 2257.839
that makes no sense

2254.8 --> 2257.8390000000004
how is it staying there

2263.119 --> 2266.96
right gravity yeah i know i'm

2264.8 --> 2269.8390000000004
presupposing a lot but that's the thing

2266.96 --> 2271.92
you know it's what i like to do that

2269.839 --> 2274.0
yeah i know it's all [ __ ] but even

2271.92 --> 2276.4
if you dig into the mechanical

2274.0 --> 2278.4
conceptions of it right the framework of

2276.4 --> 2279.76
the conceptions which i'm very

2278.4 --> 2283.04
interested in

2279.76 --> 2286.2400000000002
that's kind of my science fiction hobby

2283.04 --> 2288.64
i believed it for a long time

2286.24 --> 2290.72
right but it makes no sense and even

2288.64 --> 2292.8799999999997
what i'm asking right now

2290.72 --> 2295.1189999999997
would be the same pesky questions i'd be

2292.88 --> 2296.8
asking 20 years ago

2295.119 --> 2298.7200000000003
when i still believed it's real because

2296.8 --> 2301.2000000000003
i was just trying to figure out like how

2298.72 --> 2303.7599999999998
is this supposed to work

2301.2 --> 2304.72
it doesn't make any sense

2303.76 --> 2306.7200000000003
it's

2304.72 --> 2308.64
it contradicts itself and then always

2306.72 --> 2310.3199999999997
people that would defend it all the

2308.64 --> 2312.0
people that were very studied and would

2310.32 --> 2315.04
always be like oh yeah you just don't

2312.0 --> 2315.04
understand right

2316.56 --> 2320.64
that's

2318.48 --> 2323.119
has been the story of my life i'm just

2320.64 --> 2324.24
now redoing it with the knowledge that i

2323.119 --> 2327.599
have

2324.24 --> 2330.5989999999997
from a more secure vantage point

2327.599 --> 2330.599
intellectually

2350.96 --> 2355.599
research orbital mechanics extremely

2353.68 --> 2358.3199999999997
well documented

2355.599 --> 2358.32
yes

2358.72 --> 2361.1189999999997
sure

2364.079 --> 2369.52
still makes no sense though

2366.64 --> 2372.16
then again yeah you're basically leading

2369.52 --> 2375.119
with the entire conception

2372.16 --> 2376.48
on cons on another conception called

2375.119 --> 2378.8
gravity

2376.48 --> 2380.96
that technically when you're in required

2378.8 --> 2382.48
to explain you don't even exactly know

2380.96 --> 2384.96
what it is i mean there's like

2382.48 --> 2387.359
descriptions of it mathematically

2384.96 --> 2390.88
there's things you may be assuming about

2387.359 --> 2391.7599999999998
it that aren't officially recognized

2390.88 --> 2394.079
so

2391.76 --> 2397.5200000000004
but still you have that within the

2394.079 --> 2400.4
entire conception of orbits

2397.52 --> 2402.96
right something that isn't even properly

2400.4 --> 2405.359
clearly defined in its in what it

2402.96 --> 2408.4
exactly is and does

2405.359 --> 2411.2
how you should use it in any models like

2408.4 --> 2414.079
that's not defined guys how to use

2411.2 --> 2416.56
gravity in models

2414.079 --> 2418.96
in heliocentric it's not

2416.56 --> 2420.56
defined

2418.96 --> 2423.04
you see

2420.56 --> 2425.92
you just say gravity

2423.04 --> 2428.4
it's not really defined like how is it

2425.92 --> 2428.4
doing that

2428.48 --> 2431.359
attraction over a distance

2430.64 --> 2434.0789999999997
but

2431.359 --> 2436.0
that's newtonian claim right that's a

2434.079 --> 2438.2400000000002
newtonian thing oh

2436.0 --> 2440.4
grabs it over a distance but he never

2438.24 --> 2443.52
claimed the hypothesis for it though he

2440.4 --> 2446.96
strictly said this is nonsense i don't

2443.52 --> 2449.599
stand behind this idea

2446.96 --> 2451.28
right einstein i think does never even

2449.599 --> 2453.44
claimed it like that

2451.28 --> 2455.599
he just approached it mathematically and

2453.44 --> 2458.48
then he could only calculate one body of

2455.599 --> 2461.04
attraction to everything else

2458.48 --> 2463.44
so he never even completed

2461.04 --> 2465.44
the conceptual process of how it's

2463.44 --> 2467.76
supposed to be working

2465.44 --> 2470.079
he just unleashed a bunch of math on the

2467.76 --> 2470.079
idea

2472.079 --> 2481.079
so how is gravity now supposed to then

2475.76 --> 2481.079
keep a satellite at a set distance

2483.28 --> 2488.079
without any strings attached

2485.839 --> 2490.24
because of gravity but how how is

2488.079 --> 2493.2000000000003
gravity doing that

2490.24 --> 2499.1189999999997
what is gravity doing in order to keep

2493.2 --> 2502.3999999999996
that satellite at a geostationary orbit

2499.119 --> 2504.48
it's just hanging there supposedly right

2502.4 --> 2506.48
even though yeah get closer oh it falls

2504.48 --> 2509.839
down oh but oh for that distance it

2506.48 --> 2509.839
doesn't fall down

2509.92 --> 2514.4
but i think it does because everything

2512.319 --> 2516.4
kind of falls like even technically the

2514.4 --> 2518.56
moon is claimed to be

2516.4 --> 2520.96
perpetually falling it's in orbit of

2518.56 --> 2522.88
earth it's always falling around it

2520.96 --> 2526.0
right so it's technically still being

2522.88 --> 2528.319
attracted to the earth

2526.0 --> 2530.96
but it yeah the

2528.319 --> 2533.04
centripetal force of the fall keeps it

2530.96 --> 2534.88
in its place sort of

2533.04 --> 2537.2
right well i'm pretty sure that

2534.88 --> 2538.8
satellites are a lot closer to the earth

2537.2 --> 2542.16
than the moon

2538.8 --> 2546.319
yeah a lot closer

2542.16 --> 2550.72
so how is gravity preventing

2546.319 --> 2553.2
those things from just crashing down

2550.72 --> 2555.2
right they're not particularly flying

2553.2 --> 2557.7599999999998
very fast they don't have a lot of

2555.2 --> 2559.04
centripetal force right

2557.76 --> 2561.28
because

2559.04 --> 2562.4
they assume centripetal force because

2561.28 --> 2564.4
they're not

2562.4 --> 2566.88
moving super fast if they're supposedly

2564.4 --> 2569.2000000000003
moving super fast then the centripetal

2566.88 --> 2570.88
force can keep it at a distance away

2569.2 --> 2573.4399999999996
from the earth right

2570.88 --> 2574.48
like the moon

2573.44 --> 2575.76
but

2574.48 --> 2578.4
which is weird by the way because the

2575.76 --> 2580.3190000000004
moon rotates even slower around the

2578.4 --> 2581.839
earth than the earth spins

2580.319 --> 2583.52
i think

2581.839 --> 2585.7599999999998
that's kind of weird

2583.52 --> 2587.92
in the model so even that's already

2585.76 --> 2590.3190000000004
probably let's not already get into that

2587.92 --> 2593.839
giant moon sized mess

2590.319 --> 2593.839
about the orbit of the moon right

2595.2 --> 2599.5989999999997
if you want to know about that just

2596.4 --> 2599.599
watch moon falling

2602.24 --> 2606.4799999999996
but right there's supposedly not enough

2603.92 --> 2608.56
centripetal force to keep that satellite

2606.48 --> 2610.4
at that distance because it's moving at

2608.56 --> 2613.04
the same

2610.4 --> 2615.92
rotation

2613.04 --> 2618.96
as the earth supposedly

2615.92 --> 2621.52
so how is that satellite then just kept

2618.96 --> 2624.56
at that distance

2621.52 --> 2627.04
it makes no sense like it doesn't really

2624.56 --> 2629.359
matter how you put it together

2627.04 --> 2631.119
how i put it together with the with

2629.359 --> 2633.119
really understanding the conceptions you

2631.119 --> 2635.599
know you just don't understand no or

2633.119 --> 2638.8
between yeah i do understand because i

2635.599 --> 2641.52
liked thinking about that a lot

2638.8 --> 2642.319
spend a lot of my youth wasting my time

2641.52 --> 2644.16
on

2642.319 --> 2646.319
thinking and dreaming about that sort of

2644.16 --> 2647.2799999999997
nonsense

2646.319 --> 2649.2
right

2647.28 --> 2652.079
in my mind

2649.2 --> 2654.96
but it doesn't make any sense though

2652.079 --> 2658.4
right it's almost like

2654.96 --> 2660.079
it's just said this is what it is

2658.4 --> 2661.52
these are the parameters this is what

2660.079 --> 2662.96
you must believe about but when you

2661.52 --> 2664.72
start to figure it out then you

2662.96 --> 2666.64
eventually kind of

2664.72 --> 2668.24
if you're honest with yourself you you

2666.64 --> 2670.319
run in a dead end

2668.24 --> 2672.56
and just have to like okay i just don't

2670.319 --> 2675.52
understand

2672.56 --> 2677.359
this is what everybody's gonna say

2675.52 --> 2680.0
right and they're pushed on the

2677.359 --> 2681.92
mechanical details like could you please

2680.0 --> 2683.76
model this out

2681.92 --> 2686.0
how that satellite supposed to be

2683.76 --> 2688.96
hanging there geostationary

2686.0 --> 2691.28
can you model that out please

2688.96 --> 2692.64
i don't think people can effectively do

2691.28 --> 2693.599
that

2692.64 --> 2695.2
right

2693.599 --> 2697.119
well they can do it but they will have

2695.2 --> 2699.5989999999997
to slip in certain things that aren't

2697.119 --> 2702.0
even officially accepted anymore

2699.599 --> 2704.319
like newtonian gravity

2702.0 --> 2705.839
right they have to start oh you yeah

2704.319 --> 2707.7599999999998
you're gonna use grab well you're gonna

2705.839 --> 2710.4
have to use a model for gravity right

2707.76 --> 2712.6400000000003
you can only really use utility and

2710.4 --> 2715.2000000000003
gravity even though it's not accepted

2712.64 --> 2717.52
and it's not even claimed anymore

2715.2 --> 2719.68
yeah so that's gonna happen then you're

2717.52 --> 2722.48
just gonna build a machination based on

2719.68 --> 2725.2
your own personal interpretation it must

2722.48 --> 2727.28
be like this

2725.2 --> 2730.2799999999997
even though it doesn't actually match

2727.28 --> 2730.28
anything

2739.04 --> 2741.839
oh my god

2745.52 --> 2752.16
they are moving

2747.599 --> 2752.1600000000003
11 times faster than fighter jets

2752.64 --> 2759.2
the geostationary satellites

2756.8 --> 2761.599
right yeah the difference is though that

2759.2 --> 2763.359
fighter jets are actually kept in the

2761.599 --> 2766.319
air by lift

2763.359 --> 2766.319
through their wings

2767.68 --> 2770.96
yeah

2768.8 --> 2773.599
i don't think satellites has

2770.96 --> 2774.64
lift through wings so it's very weird

2773.599 --> 2776.48
that you

2774.64 --> 2778.96
compare

2776.48 --> 2780.72
a geostationary satellite supposedly

2778.96 --> 2782.8
with a fighter jet

2780.72 --> 2784.72
right because they're completely two

2782.8 --> 2786.7200000000003
different devices

2784.72 --> 2788.56
right yeah fighter jet i get it it has

2786.72 --> 2790.8799999999997
lift it has wings

2788.56 --> 2793.119
it it gets those wings get a push from

2790.88 --> 2796.1600000000003
the air as it goes through it yeah

2793.119 --> 2798.7200000000003
the satellite doesn't have that

2796.16 --> 2801.7599999999998
so how is that working

2798.72 --> 2804.0789999999997
kind of a false comparison if you ask me

2801.76 --> 2805.92
just because they are claimed to build

2804.079 --> 2807.52
up speeds doesn't mean that they work

2805.92 --> 2809.76
the same the satellite doesn't have

2807.52 --> 2813.56
wings it doesn't have lift makes no

2809.76 --> 2813.5600000000004
sense to compare that

2825.839 --> 2831.2799999999997
okay you can [ __ ] off

2829.839 --> 2833.44
you're not even engaging in the

2831.28 --> 2836.6800000000003
conversation dick

2833.44 --> 2836.68
get out

2849.599 --> 2852.599
um

2860.64 --> 2866.5989999999997
who pays you

2862.8 --> 2866.599
who are you talking about

2875.599 --> 2878.96
oh god brynn

2880.079 --> 2884.079
yeah nobody pays them they just don't

2881.839 --> 2887.2799999999997
have a life

2884.079 --> 2889.8390000000004
their payment is

2887.28 --> 2891.119
being able to believe the globe earth

2889.839 --> 2892.16
another day

2891.119 --> 2894.96
that's

2892.16 --> 2894.96
that's their power

2895.359 --> 2900.5589999999997
that's what they do it for they don't

2898.24 --> 2904.9199999999996
they don't need payment i think they

2900.559 --> 2904.92
just do it because they have no life

2927.8 --> 2930.969
[Music]

2940.4 --> 2944.88
okay okay stone monkey thanks for that

2947.119 --> 2949.44
all right

2949.68 --> 2953.68
oh yeah by the way this is all pretty

2952.0 --> 2956.24
cool you know with all the centripetal

2953.68 --> 2957.2799999999997
force

2956.24 --> 2958.4799999999996
so

2957.28 --> 2959.8390000000004
if

2958.48 --> 2961.76
let's just

2959.839 --> 2963.839
say if right what if as the

2961.76 --> 2966.4
geostationary satellite has enough

2963.839 --> 2968.5589999999997
centripetal force to prevent it from

2966.4 --> 2972.079
falling down to the earth even though

2968.559 --> 2973.92
it's not physically connected

2972.079 --> 2977.28
so how

2973.92 --> 2978.559
how is the centrifugal force actually

2977.28 --> 2982.079
exerted

2978.559 --> 2984.88
yeah how is it exerted

2982.079 --> 2988.4
when it's not being transferred from the

2984.88 --> 2990.2400000000002
actual rotating object center

2988.4 --> 2993.28
right how does that even work can you

2990.24 --> 2995.7599999999998
demonstrate centripetal force being

2993.28 --> 2998.4
subjected to a rotating object that's

2995.76 --> 3000.559
not physically connected without using

2998.4 --> 3002.2400000000002
magnets

3000.559 --> 3003.8390000000004
by the way you couldn't even use magnets

3002.24 --> 3007.0789999999997
over distance with that so it doesn't

3003.839 --> 3007.0789999999997
even matter

3013.04 --> 3019.7599999999998
brenda reported me on bev's what

3017.52 --> 3023.48
i haven't even been to bev's

3019.76 --> 3023.48
what are you talking about

3045.92 --> 3049.48
okay good servant

3059.92 --> 3062.92
so

3081.119 --> 3087.599
okay jeff gassett fine so brenda

3083.76 --> 3089.5200000000004
reported me that's very cute

3087.599 --> 3093.6400000000003
i'm still here

3089.52 --> 3093.64
my shows are still here

3097.28 --> 3099.52
right

3099.68 --> 3104.0789999999997
even the wild wild west one it's still

3101.839 --> 3104.0789999999997
there

3104.96 --> 3108.319
it's right there

3106.4 --> 3111.04
so

3108.319 --> 3112.64
yeah

3111.04 --> 3115.52
i think it's safe to say that they're

3112.64 --> 3115.52
being ignored

3123.76 --> 3130.3190000000004
oh my god brenda you haven't debun you

3126.0 --> 3130.319
haven't won a single debate in your life

3131.04 --> 3135.8
you're kidding nobody but yourself

3188.48 --> 3192.839
right by the way i'd like to remind you

3190.559 --> 3196.48
if you appreciate what i'm

3192.839 --> 3200.16
doing please support me

3196.48 --> 3201.68
through the paypal that would be great

3200.16 --> 3203.359
still have to get through the rest of

3201.68 --> 3205.2799999999997
this month

3203.359 --> 3207.52
it's kind of worked out so far but

3205.28 --> 3209.44
yesterday i was almost broke so yeah if

3207.52 --> 3212.559
you appreciate what i'm doing i'm

3209.44 --> 3215.04
currently engaging with more ballers

3212.559 --> 3217.92
talking about orbits and it is giving me

3215.04 --> 3217.92
a bit of a headache

3219.359 --> 3223.2
because

3220.64 --> 3225.52
yeah they do what they do

3223.2 --> 3227.1189999999997
and if you support yeah if you'd like to

3225.52 --> 3229.839
support me

3227.119 --> 3231.92
this is endeavor this engagement

3229.839 --> 3233.2
then yeah please consider donating to my

3231.92 --> 3235.52
paypal

3233.2 --> 3239.5989999999997
and i also take donation from ballers

3235.52 --> 3241.68
right if you want to have just a

3239.599 --> 3243.52
a civil discussion

3241.68 --> 3245.9199999999996
that's actually civil in which you will

3243.52 --> 3248.8
not have an edge you will not be able to

3245.92 --> 3250.8
elbow your way in

3248.8 --> 3254.2400000000002
right that doesn't happen but it will

3250.8 --> 3255.8390000000004
still be as civil as i can keep it

3254.24 --> 3258.319
unless i blow up

3255.839 --> 3260.48
but yeah can't be help if that happens

3258.319 --> 3262.16
it happens don't think it's gonna happen

3260.48 --> 3264.48
today

3262.16 --> 3267.359
if you like that then please support me

3264.48 --> 3267.359
through the paypal

3268.64 --> 3271.04
right

3269.76 --> 3273.0400000000004
i don't

3271.04 --> 3274.96
ban people

3273.04 --> 3277.68
just because they think it's a ball or

3274.96 --> 3279.76
that they have neurotic responses where

3277.68 --> 3282.16
they have to keep saying that

3279.76 --> 3284.2400000000002
in the face of certain information

3282.16 --> 3286.8799999999997
don't ban them for that i just ban whiny

3284.24 --> 3288.5589999999997
[ __ ] that constantly whine about the

3286.88 --> 3289.76
format of how i'm doing thing and

3288.559 --> 3291.76
they're just

3289.76 --> 3293.599
only going to say oh you are with bands

3291.76 --> 3296.2400000000002
everybody bands everybody you bet oh

3293.599 --> 3298.96
look i'm banned oh oh look at that yeah

3296.24 --> 3300.9599999999996
get the [ __ ] out

3298.96 --> 3303.839
you're not even a baller you're just a

3300.96 --> 3306.839
whining troll

3303.839 --> 3306.839
right

3315.119 --> 3318.559
if you want to whine about something

3316.64 --> 3321.839
then whine about the ball

3318.559 --> 3321.8390000000004
and we'll figure it out

3325.52 --> 3331.04
the earth is probably no brenda

3328.24 --> 3332.0
you're probably delusional

3331.04 --> 3334.799
though

3332.0 --> 3336.96
i think a lot of people will testify to

3334.799 --> 3336.96
that

3345.76 --> 3349.8390000000004
the message retracted yeah

3354.079 --> 3358.559
you better

3356.48 --> 3361.119
because the earth is not probably a ball

3358.559 --> 3363.0400000000004
it's not a ball it's probably not a ball

3361.119 --> 3366.319
it's not a ball

3363.04 --> 3368.4
even if you presuppose all the [ __ ] that

3366.319 --> 3371.119
you're forced to presuppose even to get

3368.4 --> 3371.119
to that point

3371.2 --> 3376.319
then still it doesn't work

3374.079 --> 3380.4
even if you believe it all it still

3376.319 --> 3380.4
doesn't work when you actually test it

3385.76 --> 3389.28
oh

3386.64 --> 3391.92
so important

3389.28 --> 3393.6800000000003
you still misspelled it brilliant in a

3391.92 --> 3395.28
sentence where you did type out

3393.68 --> 3397.68
misspelled

3395.28 --> 3401.44
you still misspelled it

3397.68 --> 3405.319
that's that's genuine brilliance brenda

3401.44 --> 3405.319
you're a regular genius

3413.839 --> 3418.0789999999997
and it's not proof of the globe it's not

3416.079 --> 3420.079
a globe the globe model only works

3418.079 --> 3422.079
because the earth is flat

3420.079 --> 3424.7200000000003
because all the calculations all the

3422.079 --> 3426.2400000000002
mapping processes everything it's all

3424.72 --> 3428.5589999999997
based

3426.24 --> 3429.839
on a flat surface that's the only reason

3428.559 --> 3434.2400000000002
it works

3429.839 --> 3436.24
the earth wasn't flat if it was a globe

3434.24 --> 3438.319
it would be a lot harder to prove the

3436.24 --> 3440.5589999999997
earth's globe

3438.319 --> 3441.68
it is

3440.559 --> 3443.6800000000003
because

3441.68 --> 3445.44
well all these machinations wouldn't

3443.68 --> 3449.44
have been built

3445.44 --> 3449.44
it wouldn't have been as easy to build

3450.88 --> 3456.559
right it would be a lot more confusing

3452.88 --> 3461.079
if the earth actually was a globe

3456.559 --> 3461.079
map making would not be as easy

3483.68 --> 3490.9199999999996
that was autocorrect who the hell uses

3486.839 --> 3490.92
autocorrect oh my god

3561.44 --> 3567.7200000000003
what are you talking about good servants

3563.599 --> 3567.7200000000003
tar trek what

3613.599 --> 3616.48
oh maps are flat you just believe

3615.04 --> 3618.64
they're based on the globe well george

3616.48 --> 3620.079
sanford to be fair they are based on the

3618.64 --> 3622.8799999999997
globe

3620.079 --> 3626.0
not a globe earth though

3622.88 --> 3629.44
but a globe of the heavens

3626.0 --> 3631.839
the celestial globe that's

3629.44 --> 3634.2400000000002
what the maps the map projections are

3631.839 --> 3636.72
really based on

3634.24 --> 3640.0789999999997
they're based their globe projections

3636.72 --> 3643.4399999999996
based on the celestials

3640.079 --> 3646.2400000000002
not earth

3643.44 --> 3647.68
see the earth the the projection the

3646.24 --> 3651.319
earth map

3647.68 --> 3651.319
is secondary

3656.88 --> 3660.48
the anchor point is the celestial sphere

3658.96 --> 3663.28
the apparent

3660.48 --> 3664.559
celestial sphere assumed to be

3663.28 --> 3668.599
literal

3664.559 --> 3668.599
to be literally a sphere

3679.119 --> 3682.799
wrong you don't know what the [ __ ]

3680.88 --> 3685.52
you're talking about brenda you are one

3682.799 --> 3687.2
of the most ill-informed globers out

3685.52 --> 3690.48
there

3687.2 --> 3692.8799999999997
you spend so much time just droning

3690.48 --> 3696.72
your propaganda like a good little

3692.88 --> 3699.52
global marxist that you are

3696.72 --> 3701.68
you are not even fully informed on what

3699.52 --> 3703.92
the [ __ ] going on out there

3701.68 --> 3706.24
so when there's actual updates and

3703.92 --> 3709.2000000000003
information and insight you don't even

3706.24 --> 3711.04
pay attention to that

3709.2 --> 3713.2
yeah

3711.04 --> 3716.5589999999997
they are not based on globe earth they

3713.2 --> 3720.0789999999997
are based on globe sky

3716.559 --> 3725.2000000000003
and that's a fact it's in reversible

3720.079 --> 3728.2400000000002
irrefutable fact so based on celestial

3725.2 --> 3730.5589999999997
star apparent globe that's what they're

3728.24 --> 3732.5589999999997
based on

3730.559 --> 3735.92
their globe projections based on the

3732.559 --> 3737.28
celestial sphere the celestial sphere

3735.92 --> 3740.559
was a map

3737.28 --> 3742.7200000000003
before the earth globe map was ever

3740.559 --> 3745.2000000000003
created

3742.72 --> 3746.16
yeah that's why in the old exploration

3745.2 --> 3748.16
days

3746.16 --> 3750.3999999999996
they had like the globe with the

3748.16 --> 3752.72
constellations and the

3750.4 --> 3755.839
you know the signs and everything yeah

3752.72 --> 3758.319
the stars the globe of the stars it was

3755.839 --> 3760.96
there it was made first

3758.319 --> 3764.4
that was the first globe not globe earth

3760.96 --> 3764.4
that thing came much later

3764.559 --> 3767.799
get it

3774.0 --> 3777.0
so

3800.88 --> 3803.88
so

3824.72 --> 3827.72
hmm

3842.88 --> 3848.0
right

3843.92 --> 3848.0
i'm hearing a rooster there cry out

3848.48 --> 3853.839
while i'm reading global comments and

3850.48 --> 3853.839
thinking yeah that's very similar

3855.52 --> 3861.0389999999998
we should debates no thanks

3858.64 --> 3863.52
no thanks brenda

3861.039 --> 3867.3190000000004
i need complete waste of my time anyway

3863.52 --> 3867.319
i'll be back in two minutes

3879.119 --> 3882.119
hmm

3978.88 --> 3983.76
yeah that's right george sanford

3981.599 --> 3984.799
yeah many functioning maps before

3983.76 --> 3989.1600000000003
anybody

3984.799 --> 3989.16
thought up the globe that's right

4001.52 --> 4006.559
oh my god yes rufus or phil will did

4004.319 --> 4008.24
just say it's a globe and then that

4006.559 --> 4011.28
means it's a globe you don't have to

4008.24 --> 4011.2799999999997
actually prove it

4012.4 --> 4016.7200000000003
but it's only logical that in navigation

4014.88 --> 4019.039
manuals they tell you it's a globe

4016.72 --> 4021.0389999999998
because if they didn't it would become

4019.039 --> 4023.599
blatantly obvious that the earth is in

4021.039 --> 4023.599
the globe

4023.92 --> 4028.96
so of course they have to tell you

4027.52 --> 4030.85
because yeah

4028.96 --> 4032.079
people might suddenly

4030.85 --> 4034.799
[Music]

4032.079 --> 4036.4
unwittingly figure out it's not a globe

4034.799 --> 4039.359
so they have to tell you oh yeah yeah

4036.4 --> 4042.559
it's a globe though it's a globe really

4039.359 --> 4042.5589999999997
just think of it as a globe

4044.559 --> 4049.079
oh brenda shut up

4073.359 --> 4076.359
okay

4104.96 --> 4109.96
i'm getting really bored with this

4121.759 --> 4126.0
right yeah

4123.52 --> 4128.4800000000005
now i'm not in a uh

4126.0 --> 4130.56
still i have not recovered by the way

4128.48 --> 4133.678999999999
which is a surprise to me because it's

4130.56 --> 4136.319
now an hour later

4133.679 --> 4138.2390000000005
but apparently i i did not sleep well

4136.319 --> 4140.319
this night

4138.239 --> 4142.879999999999
i hope i'll be back to my old self

4140.319 --> 4142.88
tomorrow

4143.12 --> 4148.239

4144.88 --> 4148.2390000000005
