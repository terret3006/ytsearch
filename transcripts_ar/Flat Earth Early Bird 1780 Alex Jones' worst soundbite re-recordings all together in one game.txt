121.439 --> 127.6
it but I'm okay for now this

125.159 --> 130.64000000000001
weekend and that means I'll still need

127.6 --> 133.48
donations for after that so I'm

130.64 --> 136.83999999999997
basically never really fully okay it's

133.48 --> 140.44
just now it's doable enough to do

136.84 --> 142.4
shows at this moment right and thank you

140.44 --> 145.4
for the

142.4 --> 145.4
anonymous

146.68 --> 152.08
donation shows possible because of that

149.36 --> 154.519
and of course also because of Mojo in

152.08 --> 157.4
Illuminati cant

154.519 --> 159.20000000000002
support right the weather today is kind

157.4 --> 162.519
of sunny

159.2 --> 165.67999999999998
and little bit cloudy it's very similar

162.519 --> 165.68
to two days

168.08 --> 171.84
ago it's not a lot of

175.879 --> 186.39999999999998
wind so I estimate it's probably

180.72 --> 186.4
like 12 or 13° C

187.159 --> 196.959
this yeah but the lack of wind

191.36 --> 196.959
does help a bit against the cold

197.64 --> 205.04
right so hello everyone it's Friday the

201.4 --> 208.12
17th of November

205.04 --> 211.07999999999998
2023 starting a bit late I really was

208.12 --> 213.68
going to start on time like for

211.08 --> 215.08
real but then one of the roommates was

213.68 --> 218.28
in the

215.08 --> 220.12
shower so yeah I couldn't like do my

218.28 --> 222.239
hair and brush my teeth so I was

220.12 --> 224.28
basically just waiting on that and

222.239 --> 227.59900000000002
that's literally now the reason why I'm

224.28 --> 227.599
late otherwise I wouldn't have been

228.56 --> 233.439
late

230.28 --> 238.68
right anyway let's check the

233.439 --> 241.68

274.0 --> 279.12
again I don't know if that's the same as

276.32 --> 281.52
stalling though it's not stalling to me

279.12 --> 284.24
it's just that the image just freezes

281.52 --> 287.12
it's weird usually only does it at the

284.24 --> 290.12
beginning of the show for me it's not

287.12 --> 292.56

290.12 --> 295.08

uh yeah thanks to a Anonymous

522.399 --> 525.8
donor I am

527.37 --> 530.549
[Music]

530.88 --> 536.92
not

532.56 --> 536.92
right so yeah show can

538.2 --> 546.0
continue can talk with a whole bunch of

542.92 --> 547.16
things had a good dinner and all that so

546.0 --> 548.88
I feel pretty

547.16 --> 551.68
strengthened

548.88 --> 553.36
but there's like a cold going around

551.68 --> 557.8389999999999
like my healer

553.36 --> 560.88
cold is it yesterday no two days ago not

557.839 --> 561.7600000000001
sure somewhere between yesterday and two

560.88 --> 565.56
days

561.76 --> 567.64
ago but he had a cold too so there's

565.56 --> 570.399
just and

567.64 --> 572.92
logically getting sick or getting a cold

570.399 --> 577.32
in response to like negative situ

572.92 --> 579.519
negative conflicts being resolved makes

577.32 --> 580.7600000000001
sense everything that's going around in

579.519 --> 584.92
the

580.76 --> 587.76
world I've mostly been able to Avail all

584.92 --> 591.04
that but I'm just getting a bit more

587.76 --> 591.959
than more sniffy than average like in

591.04 --> 594.8389999999999
the

591.959 --> 597.88
last days so that's

594.839 --> 600.399
also why it was kind of welcome for me

597.88 --> 603.2
to just have a day off so it could

600.399 --> 603.2
really calm

604.079 --> 607.079
down

614.6 --> 622.8000000000001
huh he would say something like that in

619.36 --> 622.8000000000001
future based on

628.04 --> 631.04
what

637.76 --> 642.0
made a vid on

640.279 --> 644.05
Perry

642.0 --> 647.26
what who the hell is

644.05 --> 647.26
[Music]

647.32 --> 652.0400000000001
that I have no idea what you're talking

649.72 --> 652.0400000000001
about

658.04 --> 661.04
DED

672.3 --> 679.549
[Music]

687.959 --> 693.279
Perry

689.76 --> 695.9399999999999
Matthew Perry I don't know who that oh

693.279 --> 700.919
wait hold on the

695.94 --> 700.9190000000001
[Music]

702.68 --> 710.04
[ __ ] right that

706.44 --> 712.519
guy the guy that died okay now I get it

710.04 --> 715.8
oh we made a video about him well yeah

712.519 --> 719.71
that's down yeah Cher exactly yeah

715.8 --> 721.279
that's down R's Lane so yeah

719.71 --> 725.24
[Music]

721.279 --> 725.24
pretty logical prediction to make I'd

741.92 --> 745.12
say all

747.88 --> 753.85
right

750.68 --> 753.8499999999999
[Music]

755.68 --> 760.8
RV thinks all celebrities do fake death

758.56 --> 763.399
before they act it's

760.8 --> 766.24
hilarious like actors aren't really

763.399 --> 766.24
humans or

769.399 --> 774.11
something like what the hell is he

771.76 --> 777.8389999999999
basing that

774.11 --> 780.839
[Music]

777.839 --> 780.839
on

782.04 --> 790.0
like if seriously if all actors do that

786.0 --> 791.6
there would be like more people spotting

790.0 --> 794.519
dead

791.6 --> 797.44
actors and then getting ridiculed like

794.519 --> 799.519
oh like Elvis like the Elvis I've seen

797.44 --> 802.2790000000001
Elvis is like the only thing that's

799.519 --> 804.88
really as far as I know has been like

802.279 --> 807.48
going around for

804.88 --> 810.76
ages it's just crazy people that believe

807.48 --> 810.76
they see him or something

820.24 --> 827.48
but it's a magic calculator every

823.24 --> 831.03
celebrity name is 33 of course they

827.48 --> 834.12
are hey expeditious truth good to see

831.03 --> 834.12
[Music]

834.759 --> 843.7
you maybe if few have that's a stretch

838.0 --> 846.829
well look maybe oh God I wish I would go

843.7 --> 846.8290000000001
[Music]

848.04 --> 853.519
there the dark world may be like the

851.399 --> 856.68
actor's

853.519 --> 858.48
Heaven it's this completely crazy idea

856.68 --> 862.8
really but yeah they would have to all

858.48 --> 866.6
be involved in like aluc altic drugs and

862.8 --> 866.5999999999999
all that they might just as well

866.759 --> 874.399
be I mean that place is like a a giant

871.759 --> 876.44
Hol deck so what more would an actor

874.399 --> 879.6
want

876.44 --> 879.6
really you

880.16 --> 887.48
know Sun's entered Scorpio how do you

884.48 --> 887.48
feel

888.8 --> 895.279
what I'm a little preoccupied with my

892.6 --> 897.6800000000001
contemporary scenarios and all that in

895.279 --> 900.04
my life to really

897.68 --> 904.7589999999999
tell

900.04 --> 904.759
difference of celestial origin

910.759 --> 917.92
teret how should I be

914.0 --> 920.04
feeling I mean I've been applying

917.92 --> 922.36
techniques the technique and all that

920.04 --> 924.199
heavily I think that that really like

922.36 --> 927.92
has a massive

924.199 --> 930.68
influence very palpably to me like I can

927.92 --> 933.88
liter my feelings just become different

930.68 --> 936.519
and like this my

933.88 --> 938.959
senses like my physical touch senses

936.519 --> 942.759
like that kind of thing yeah massive

938.959 --> 944.279
changes and that's like every day I do

942.759 --> 949.16
that

944.279 --> 951.959
so I don't really feel the subtle

949.16 --> 954.56
changes I mean I might feel something

951.959 --> 956.0
coming right like oh there's something

954.56 --> 959.5999999999999
coming

956.0 --> 962.279
ahead but it's not like oh oh

959.6 --> 966.1990000000001
it's transitioned from this to that all

962.279 --> 970.68
of a sudden and then I feel that

966.199 --> 970.68
no it's all gradual

971.12 --> 977.079
anyway all these technical fault line

974.839 --> 979.48
these break lines between this

977.079 --> 982.5999999999999
astrological and that astr dude it's

979.48 --> 985.48
actually a spectrum

982.6 --> 987.12
okay it's just that these breake lines

985.48 --> 990.88
are

987.12 --> 990.88
like the per perfect

991.6 --> 994.6
5050

994.959 --> 997.959
really

1003.0 --> 1010.24
anyway they go to no no D it it's

1014.519 --> 1019.639
ridiculous hey slow mo moon buggy you

1017.44 --> 1022.5600000000001
woke up with crazy czy insights okay

1019.639 --> 1022.5600000000001
what kind of crazy

1047.4 --> 1050.4
insights

1051.96 --> 1054.96
[ __ ] sake D

1077.4 --> 1080.4
it

1089.159 --> 1095.96
I mean seriously you guys just speculate

1091.84 --> 1095.9599999999998
about complete hor [ __ ] way too

1096.24 --> 1101.96
much like what the hell is even the

1098.919 --> 1102.8400000000001
point like seriously what the [ __ ] is

1101.96 --> 1106.039
the

1102.84 --> 1109.12
point if certain actors or whatever

1106.039 --> 1114.0
would even retire to some remote Island

1109.12 --> 1114.0
like who gives a

1114.28 --> 1122.2
[ __ ] I don't I don't know why the

1118.64 --> 1126.96
conspir nuts like always have to bring

1122.2 --> 1126.96
that up I don't get it it's so

1137.32 --> 1140.32
inconsequential

1163.52 --> 1168.36
wrote this all the oh okay fair enough

1165.64 --> 1170.8400000000001
ter I mean yes RV overblows all of that

1168.36 --> 1170.84
but I mean

1171.44 --> 1178.28
that's like I'm not going to try to tell

1175.08 --> 1181.6
any of this to him okay I mean he's

1178.28 --> 1183.8799999999999
heard it and he's ignored it he just he

1181.6 --> 1185.559
just loves to do this stuff it's his

1183.88 --> 1190.24
thing I

1185.559 --> 1190.24
don't I think it's complete waste of

1191.0 --> 1197.08
time it's about as constructive as just

1194.24 --> 1197.08
playing video

1197.24 --> 1200.24
games

1200.559 --> 1205.84
which I Do by the way and it's not super

1203.159 --> 1205.8400000000001
constructive

1227.159 --> 1234.0800000000002
either

1229.32 --> 1237.12
what to be like him oretti what are you

1234.08 --> 1237.12

1280.159 --> 1287.0390000000002
great so yeah there's freaking drilling

1284.12 --> 1292.6
or whatever in the house

1287.039 --> 1292.6
and just the delightful sound

1293.68 --> 1299.2
[Music]

1295.08 --> 1302.1999999999998
of like those vibrator plates that

1299.2 --> 1306.44
put Stone tiles in

1302.2 --> 1306.44
place which are very freaking

1310.84 --> 1316.3
[Music]

1317.039 --> 1320.039
loud

1321.11 --> 1324.2099999999998
[Music]

1330.84 --> 1334.559
it sounds like they're Drilling in your

1335.159 --> 1338.159
house

1342.0 --> 1346.96
H freaky safe from an accident oh

1345.66 --> 1349.96
[Music]

1346.96 --> 1349.96
okay

1376.96 --> 1379.96
a

1388.4 --> 1394.76
my God it's like literally it's what is

1391.919 --> 1397.96
it 200 M that

1394.76 --> 1401.6
way and I can literally hear the sound

1397.96 --> 1403.8400000000001
just make the air in here vibrate I mean

1401.6 --> 1406.279
it's that's messed

1403.84 --> 1408.32
up don't even want to imagine what it

1406.279 --> 1411.08
would be like to have to handle that

1408.32 --> 1411.08
thing as a

1436.88 --> 1439.88
person

1445.679 --> 1452.24
okay

1447.96 --> 1455.2
teret so either just the average quality

1452.24 --> 1460.159
of your transport over there really

1455.2 --> 1462.44
sucks or you're over focusing right if

1460.159 --> 1464.7600000000002
you start to like really believe in

1462.44 --> 1467.159
astrology you can literally start

1464.76 --> 1468.6
summoning things happening where they

1467.159 --> 1472.159
wouldn't before

1468.6 --> 1472.1589999999999
because you're over focusing on

1473.799 --> 1480.08
it it's not about running out of luck

1476.44 --> 1480.0800000000002
it's because you're over focusing on

1480.48 --> 1486.72
it

1483.36 --> 1489.4799999999998
right I mean you found the

1486.72 --> 1493.3990000000001
hammer you you now really you're looking

1489.48 --> 1496.039
for nails to to bash down with it at

1493.399 --> 1498.6
some point you're GNA hit your toe with

1496.039 --> 1501.6
it or your or your thumb

1498.6 --> 1503.24
that's literally kind of like what it is

1501.6 --> 1504.8799999999999
so if you're over focusing and you're

1503.24 --> 1507.679
like oh getting all these signs you're

1504.88 --> 1509.0390000000002
reading and you're like zoning in on

1507.679 --> 1514.3600000000001
that

1509.039 --> 1516.559
spiritually then you manifest it you you

1514.36 --> 1518.9599999999998
actually manifest it where if you

1516.559 --> 1521.72
literally let it slip by didn't even

1518.96 --> 1525.0
take notice nothing would have

1521.72 --> 1526.679
happened yeah it's about the energy in

1525.0 --> 1529.679
the moment with your

1526.679 --> 1529.679
consciousness

1529.799 --> 1535.52
if you just jump on every single sign

1532.72 --> 1538.32
you get you're going to create those

1535.52 --> 1541.6399999999999
things because you're

1538.32 --> 1545.36
enthusiastically leaping towards them

1541.64 --> 1545.3600000000001
teret you're over

1551.399 --> 1556.52
focusing what's the chances of two

1553.6 --> 1559.6789999999999
mishaps happening back to back

1556.52 --> 1559.679
incredibly High

1560.08 --> 1564.76
in my

1562.24 --> 1567.64
opinion yeah this is not a stupid

1564.76 --> 1571.8799999999999
calculus game

1567.64 --> 1573.159
yeah mishaps actual mishaps in my

1571.88 --> 1575.679
personal

1573.159 --> 1578.6000000000001
experience they never come

1575.679 --> 1579.88
alone something goes wrong everything

1578.6 --> 1583.039
goes

1579.88 --> 1585.88
wrong that's why if I break something I

1583.039 --> 1590.559
get terrified because that usually means

1585.88 --> 1593.2
oh [ __ ] what are the other two things

1590.559 --> 1596.6
that are going to go wrong today because

1593.2 --> 1596.6000000000001
they do a lot of the

1597.919 --> 1604.96
time but then again if you over focus on

1601.2 --> 1607.559
it and you over realize then you also

1604.96 --> 1610.08
manifest but it it does go that way on

1607.559 --> 1613.8799999999999
average it's just when I get bad luck

1610.08 --> 1615.799
then I feel bad and then it more bad

1613.88 --> 1619.24
luck

1615.799 --> 1624.0
happens the only ER logical response to

1619.24 --> 1630.039
bad luck is to let all that connecting

1624.0 --> 1631.6
up with the moment go and just like oh

1630.039 --> 1635.399
something went

1631.6 --> 1638.279
wrong I need to be more focused on

1635.399 --> 1640.6399999999999
preventing

1638.279 --> 1643.279
mishaps and then take that really

1640.64 --> 1646.159
serious but not so serious like oh it's

1643.279 --> 1648.12
my mission but like internally only

1646.159 --> 1651.44
internally don't communicate about it at

1648.12 --> 1654.08
all it's just a pure personal internal

1651.44 --> 1657.919
Mission like

1654.08 --> 1661.039
Focus because lack of focus is really

1657.919 --> 1663.76
the thing that often creates the mishap

1661.039 --> 1668.32
when mishaps happen and that's why

1663.76 --> 1668.32
mishaps rarely come alone in my

1673.799 --> 1679.279
experience hello clutch good to see you

1678.12 --> 1681.279
[Music]

1679.279 --> 1683.919
where's everybody else did everybody

1681.279 --> 1686.919
with that didn't get their wrenches back

1683.919 --> 1686.919
just

1687.24 --> 1692.2
leave let me check the moderator list

1689.84 --> 1692.1999999999998
this is

1692.48 --> 1697.799
weird oh by the way I'm really going to

1694.72 --> 1701.159
try to get an an Illuminati cant again

1697.799 --> 1701.1589999999999
tomorrow for

1701.399 --> 1707.5189999999998
tomorrow Mojo I know you seem to really

1704.679 --> 1712.3200000000002
like me getting them cuz you PayPal

1707.519 --> 1712.32
donate specifically for Illuminati

1713.6 --> 1719.08
ciss and hey they're kind of expensive

1716.279 --> 1721.2
these days so I kind of appreciate it I

1719.08 --> 1724.8799999999999
probably wouldn't get them anymore if it

1721.2 --> 1727.88
wasn't for his specific

1724.88 --> 1727.88
support

1728.039 --> 1733.8799999999999
uh cuz I mean I'm not going to buy

1730.64 --> 1736.96
something else with it if you say in

1733.88 --> 1739.3990000000001
your donation like Illuminati cant

1736.96 --> 1739.3990000000001
support

1740.159 --> 1745.7600000000002
although if you're well these days if

1743.519 --> 1748.2
you'd say oh T coffee but I don't drink

1745.76 --> 1749.679
taric coffee during the show anymore

1748.2 --> 1753.2
it's too early for

1749.679 --> 1756.0
me I mean if let's just say I would at

1753.2 --> 1761.3600000000001
some point like do a night owl show

1756.0 --> 1764.48
again I could very well get an A uh a

1761.36 --> 1764.4799999999998
taric coffee during

1766.32 --> 1772.039
that

1768.12 --> 1776.039
and by the way I am really enjoying it

1772.039 --> 1778.559
even with the relative less food and all

1776.039 --> 1781.919
that I am enjoying the coffees they're

1778.559 --> 1785.9189999999999
not having a negative influence on me

1781.919 --> 1788.039
like haven't you like even my mood

1785.919 --> 1790.88
technically

1788.039 --> 1795.24
right in the past the coffee could like

1790.88 --> 1797.679
have really like me getting very

1795.24 --> 1799.48
angry because of it and if I had that

1797.679 --> 1801.0800000000002
kind of effect sometimes it doesn't seem

1799.48 --> 1803.039
to really be happening

1801.08 --> 1805.559
anymore it's

1803.039 --> 1810.32
like the

1805.559 --> 1812.279
way my body just responds to substances

1810.32 --> 1814.12
and all that seems like it's a bit

1812.279 --> 1816.559
different in

1814.12 --> 1817.6399999999999
ways but it's because of my spirits

1816.559 --> 1819.519
because of my

1817.64 --> 1824.6000000000001
attitude

1819.519 --> 1830.0
cuz some of you might know about it but

1824.6 --> 1832.84
it's like the way you compose yourself

1830.0 --> 1838.44
spiritually it's like your social

1832.84 --> 1838.4399999999998
spiritual attitude towards the world

1838.799 --> 1844.559
yourself and those you communicate

1841.84 --> 1848.039
with like can

1844.559 --> 1850.6789999999999
palpably influence the way you

1848.039 --> 1853.08
experience

1850.679 --> 1855.3200000000002
substances right and not just like oh

1853.08 --> 1858.519
the weed man you killed the buzz now I

1855.32 --> 1860.2
feel Downer not just like that no even

1858.519 --> 1863.08
like with

1860.2 --> 1865.159
coffee with alcohol is probably the most

1863.08 --> 1867.1999999999998
notable me

1865.159 --> 1869.96
yeah

1867.2 --> 1872.24
but like even things like coffee might

1869.96 --> 1874.96
just have a different influence on your

1872.24 --> 1878.76
body because your entire composure is

1874.96 --> 1881.8400000000001
has become different like

1878.76 --> 1885.039
less getting carried away with

1881.84 --> 1888.36
negativity and

1885.039 --> 1891.12
Obsession because I was it's typically

1888.36 --> 1894.32
in me to do that I and the weird thing

1891.12 --> 1897.1589999999999
is like that mechanism even though

1894.32 --> 1900.36
technically unhealthy I've really

1897.159 --> 1905.1200000000001
learned to like exploit

1900.36 --> 1908.9599999999998
it in a effective but unique way it's

1905.12 --> 1911.279
just that then you have to get out of

1908.96 --> 1913.799
it cuz there's better ways to doing

1911.279 --> 1917.679
things it's basically like

1913.799 --> 1923.36
a a defensive response that erect that

1917.679 --> 1923.3600000000001
scenario that's that effect it's like

1924.44 --> 1929.6390000000001
blocking and then yeah normal people

1927.159 --> 1934.2
might just like oh this is just not the

1929.639 --> 1937.32
right time they go wait for me it's like

1934.2 --> 1939.6000000000001
no I'm just going to analyze it in

1937.32 --> 1943.2
another

1939.6 --> 1945.08
way but then later it will fall off it's

1943.2 --> 1947.44
like the shield will fall off I will

1945.08 --> 1950.9189999999999
have familiarized people will familiar

1947.44 --> 1952.919
with me and then like the shield just

1950.919 --> 1955.159
drop and then it doesn't work anymore

1952.919 --> 1958.2
everything I learned in that specific

1955.159 --> 1961.44
trick that I do during that phase the

1958.2 --> 1965.519
mechanisms don't work anymore then after

1961.44 --> 1968.3600000000001
that is really temporary magic in a

1965.519 --> 1971.44
way temporary exploitation it's not

1968.36 --> 1974.4799999999998
really magic it's just exploitation in

1971.44 --> 1974.48
an unexpected

1974.679 --> 1980.6000000000001
way and that is very Magic IAL by the

1978.32 --> 1983.399
way to

1980.6 --> 1987.36
people because it's like you can just

1983.399 --> 1990.4799999999998
suddenly do something that nobody would

1987.36 --> 1993.32
expect that you can do in a

1990.48 --> 1994.72
moment anyway hope you're still

1993.32 --> 1997.8799999999999
following what I'm talking about it's

1994.72 --> 1997.88
getting kind of esoteric

2000.72 --> 2007.279
here right but even like as an example

2003.88 --> 2013.24
would be like rage win is is an attemp

2007.279 --> 2018.0
at exploit exploiting certain States cuz

2013.24 --> 2018.0
to be fair rwin is

2019.639 --> 2025.4799999999998
technically this is going to sound

2021.559 --> 2028.44
really weird but that entire process and

2025.48 --> 2029.44
how I throw it out is really kind of a

2028.44 --> 2031.519
nervous

2029.44 --> 2035.3990000000001
breakdown

2031.519 --> 2037.1200000000001
except it doesn't continue to break down

2035.399 --> 2038.2399999999998
it's like the start of it and then then

2037.12 --> 2040.6789999999999
I just

2038.24 --> 2042.76
like crank down the volume again

2040.679 --> 2047.1200000000001
eventually when I'm done when it's like

2042.76 --> 2051.96
when it's vibrated me enough to relieve

2047.12 --> 2051.96
me of the tension that's caused

2053.399 --> 2058.96
it but

2056.119 --> 2062.079
originally now I'm talking like teens or

2058.96 --> 2064.44
even before that what happened when I

2062.079 --> 2067.1000000000004
would now go Rin

2064.44 --> 2068.599
is ah

2067.1 --> 2071.679
[Music]

2068.599 --> 2074.119
Panic it's like everything goes full

2071.679 --> 2075.839
volume but you have no control over it

2074.119 --> 2077.8
that's how that started so it would just

2075.839 --> 2079.7999999999997
basically be like a panic attack would

2077.8 --> 2082.48
happen an

2079.8 --> 2084.8
angry I get angry and then it gets out

2082.48 --> 2087.119
of control then I I throw into panic

2084.8 --> 2090.679
because everything's gone wrong that's

2087.119 --> 2090.679
what would originally happen with

2091.09 --> 2097.119
[Music]

2093.359 --> 2099.48
it I think that in relation to that I

2097.119 --> 2103.6800000000003
kind of come a long

2099.48 --> 2103.68
way would you guys not say

2104.04 --> 2109.599
so it's like for controlling what

2107.599 --> 2111.4
originally was basically like a panic

2109.599 --> 2112.48
attack I think I'm doing pretty damn

2111.4 --> 2115.64
good with

2112.48 --> 2118.04
it I've actually like ah panic attack

2115.64 --> 2121.64
instead of like oh no I have panic

2118.04 --> 2124.56
attacks I'm so pitiful I actually like

2121.64 --> 2128.1189999999997
let's tame this [ __ ] demon let's just

2124.56 --> 2131.92
like put a rope around it and then like

2128.119 --> 2135.8
try a saddle and like and I'm like yeah

2131.92 --> 2139.079
rin's my freaking horse now I could have

2135.8 --> 2143.1600000000003
let it haunt me my entire life but now I

2139.079 --> 2147.119
tamed that Beast it's mine now it does

2143.16 --> 2149.3999999999996
as I say as I

2147.119 --> 2152.0
will and yeah I had to look like an

2149.4 --> 2155.56
idiot for it probably a whole bunch of

2152.0 --> 2157.76
my life and especially like what I do

2155.56 --> 2160.0789999999997
here like in ways it's sort of

2157.76 --> 2163.92
humiliating but I mean I've just made it

2160.079 --> 2167.04
my thing now it's my horse now it's not

2163.92 --> 2168.7200000000003
just oh look at Arn's going nuts again

2167.04 --> 2173.599
no

2168.72 --> 2173.5989999999997
no now this is my right now

2179.119 --> 2183.7200000000003
baby

2180.8 --> 2188.7200000000003

2183.72 --> 2188.72
anyway developing developing

2193.04 --> 2197.56
I've seen the late stream what what are

2195.4 --> 2199.599
you guys talking about you're talking

2197.56 --> 2202.319
about completely different things again

2199.599 --> 2204.92
aren't you you guys love to have like

2202.319 --> 2206.52
these brotherly conversations right when

2204.92 --> 2209.16
I'm about to roll out a whole bunch of

2206.52 --> 2210.839
esoteric things then you suddenly have

2209.16 --> 2212.72
like this brotherly moment where you

2210.839 --> 2215.359
have this intense

2212.72 --> 2216.8799999999997
conversation and then like I try to read

2215.359 --> 2219.24
it it's like what the hell you were

2216.88 --> 2223.04
having like you were not paying

2219.24 --> 2225.2
attention at all were you

2223.04 --> 2228.64
whatever I hope the

2225.2 --> 2231.319
Watchers enjoyed it right but what the

2228.64 --> 2234.52
hell were you talking

2231.319 --> 2236.24
about one year ago said you wouldn't do

2234.52 --> 2240.96
night

2236.24 --> 2243.56
owls yeah not as a standard definitely

2240.96 --> 2244.68
not Night Owl show is never going to be

2243.56 --> 2250.04
a Daily

2244.68 --> 2250.04
Show it's going to be a moment to moment

2251.76 --> 2257.48
show what is my method from

2254.28 --> 2259.88
transitioning from Rage win to

2257.48 --> 2264.359
rwin it's very

2259.88 --> 2264.359
complicated what it is is it's

2265.76 --> 2271.0400000000004
basically Making Peace it's just like

2271.359 --> 2277.5989999999997
accepting a big part of what helps rwi

2274.72 --> 2281.9199999999996
to calm down is to just having been able

2277.599 --> 2284.52
to manifest the opinion right I mean I

2281.92 --> 2284.52
have a lot

2284.88 --> 2291.52
of pretty heavy

2288.119 --> 2294.6400000000003
opinions and methods that I Proclaim

2291.52 --> 2296.319
like that I think I pretty hard I'm

2294.64 --> 2298.319
pretty hard with it I'm pretty harsh

2296.319 --> 2301.2799999999997
oldfashioned harsh actually on the

2298.319 --> 2305.16
inside and rage with like I've been all

2301.28 --> 2308.119
my life I'm being like just attacked

2305.16 --> 2310.68
socially not expressing that harshness

2308.119 --> 2312.76
on the inside but still like oh no

2310.68 --> 2314.24
everything's to hard to soft every

2312.76 --> 2317.119
everybody's all softening up all

2314.24 --> 2320.04
becoming [ __ ] idiotic it's like an

2317.119 --> 2323.1600000000003
assault and now I feel like I must

2320.04 --> 2325.72
Express this when I have rwi it's

2323.16 --> 2331.0789999999997
basically me just sharing my opinion as

2325.72 --> 2334.1189999999997
it is on the inside a lot it's like I'm

2331.079 --> 2338.28
really [ __ ] pissed off about things

2334.119 --> 2340.28
and I like all for really really hard me

2338.28 --> 2343.88
harsh

2340.28 --> 2347.2400000000002
methods like things that we would shock

2343.88 --> 2349.0
people now but actually like even in the

2347.24 --> 2352.1189999999997
20th centuries there were plenty of

2349.0 --> 2354.599
countries in Europe that would still

2352.119 --> 2356.6800000000003
have that strictness like among the

2354.599 --> 2359.0
police and all that it's like no we

2356.68 --> 2360.1189999999997
don't [ __ ] around here and it why are

2359.0 --> 2364.119
they so

2360.119 --> 2366.6400000000003
mean yeah because [ __ ] crazy rapist

2364.119 --> 2368.92
criminals and [ __ ] they were actually

2366.64 --> 2372.839
there you know they're still there but

2368.92 --> 2375.52
now police are a wastified and now all

2372.839 --> 2378.0789999999997
these [ __ ] actual demonic Maniacs

2375.52 --> 2381.7599999999998
that these really really strict harsh

2378.079 --> 2386.079
people kept at Bay are literally like

2381.76 --> 2386.079
looting and raping the

2386.119 --> 2392.0
countryside mostly through politics and

2389.28 --> 2394.8
all that and cor big Mega corporations

2392.0 --> 2398.92
and Banks

2394.8 --> 2403.88
right oh guess which groups got away

2398.92 --> 2406.7200000000003
like got rid of the the proud harsh

2403.88 --> 2411.2400000000002
old-fashioned

2406.72 --> 2414.7599999999998
strict culture yeah yeah those freaking

2411.24 --> 2417.4399999999996
disgusting Grapplers so

2414.76 --> 2421.079
yeah but I still have it in me and I

2417.44 --> 2421.079
even respected it back

2424.44 --> 2431.599
then it's it's just that like no no you

2428.16 --> 2433.319
just don't break the law you you're not

2431.599 --> 2436.079
actually supposed to do it I mean as a

2433.319 --> 2439.64
teen I had M was like you can't tell me

2436.079 --> 2441.96
what to do I do it I do it secret I'm

2439.64 --> 2446.72
naughty but I mean

2441.96 --> 2446.7200000000003
like you're actually not supposed to do

2447.48 --> 2453.68
it and if you do it in public then you

2450.56 --> 2456.52
like break a taboo which will

2453.68 --> 2459.7999999999997
normalize the bad activity which which

2456.52 --> 2461.64
will then pull at everybody in the

2459.8 --> 2463.48
neighborhood everybody that gets to hear

2461.64 --> 2466.04
about it gets to see it and they will

2463.48 --> 2469.359
all have this sudden switch of

2466.04 --> 2471.44
normalization which makes everything

2469.359 --> 2475.56
worse

2471.44 --> 2475.56
everything and that's why it's so

2476.24 --> 2482.52
important like no you don't [ __ ] around

2479.319 --> 2484.7599999999998
and do illegal [ __ ] in public to try to

2482.52 --> 2487.4
normalize because I don't take no rules

2484.76 --> 2489.0
yeah [ __ ] you in your no rules

2487.4 --> 2491.64
why do you think they're

2489.0 --> 2496.56
there if you normalize it everything

2491.64 --> 2496.56
turns to hell and it doesn't go

2497.44 --> 2505.16
back yeah Rebel in

2501.599 --> 2509.28
privacy with your I won't take no rules

2505.16 --> 2509.2799999999997
[ __ ] yeah do it in

2515.24 --> 2518.8799999999997
private hello Dr

2518.96 --> 2521.96
utar

2530.52 --> 2536.119
Crockett right but how do you control R

2533.599 --> 2536.119
wi

2539.319 --> 2547.68
uh a weird way is actually yeah I mean

2544.0 --> 2551.119
you can't do this if I don't trust you

2547.68 --> 2554.04
so let me relieve you of this oh is this

2551.119 --> 2556.52
a little trick I could do as an outsider

2554.04 --> 2561.359
no it only works if I actually trust you

2556.52 --> 2564.839
yeah but way is is it just like

2561.359 --> 2567.5989999999997
give me in the moment when I go R wi

2564.839 --> 2567.599
emotional

2568.359 --> 2573.44
recognition like that it hurts me and

2571.16 --> 2576.839
that that's why I'm so pissed off that

2573.44 --> 2579.52
I'm afraid of things getting worse

2576.839 --> 2583.16
that it hurts me that I really

2579.52 --> 2587.16
care that a lot of rwi comes forth from

2583.16 --> 2588.52
really really caring it's like I care so

2587.16 --> 2592.68
much

2588.52 --> 2594.92
I like I care about the people even when

2592.68 --> 2596.359
they're too [ __ ] to care for

2594.92 --> 2599.2000000000003
themselves about

2596.359 --> 2602.359
it and one way to kind of like achieve

2599.2 --> 2605.0789999999997
that is to just get really angry at him

2602.359 --> 2608.68
to try to snap him out of their

2605.079 --> 2608.6800000000003
delusional drunken

2613.88 --> 2619.319
dreams it's like get harsh get real even

2617.28 --> 2621.0
though it's not going to be literally

2619.319 --> 2623.72
the reality because everything's all

2621.0 --> 2625.8
become weird and convoluted out there

2623.72 --> 2629.2799999999997
and

2625.8 --> 2631.8
corrupted but on the inside it we can

2629.28 --> 2635.0
still be reminded like no that is

2631.8 --> 2635.0
actually the real

2635.079 --> 2639.76
response

2636.72 --> 2641.64
that exaggerated like harsh like

2639.76 --> 2643.4
shoulder Tosh shoulder like [ __ ] you

2641.64 --> 2645.4
we're not taking it we're going to bash

2643.4 --> 2649.1600000000003
your head in if you

2645.4 --> 2654.359
resist that's actually the real

2649.16 --> 2654.359
thing that we used to have

2654.44 --> 2662.079
proudly and Society has just like used

2657.8 --> 2665.119
social engineering to just strip it

2662.079 --> 2668.0
away like taking away the skin like

2665.119 --> 2668.0
skinning us

2668.319 --> 2672.319
taking away that

2669.92 --> 2675.599
protection natural protection and

2672.319 --> 2678.4
resilience that makes us harder to

2675.599 --> 2680.0
T it's just been stripped away from us

2678.4 --> 2682.359
but it's not going to be stripped away

2680.0 --> 2686.319
from this guy

2682.359 --> 2690.48
here cuz I will literally

2686.319 --> 2693.5589999999997
like be poor and

2690.48 --> 2694.68
completely out considered to be outside

2693.559 --> 2700.88
of

2694.68 --> 2700.8799999999997
society just to be able to retain the

2701.559 --> 2707.8
original strengths that are hidden

2705.0 --> 2709.8
within our Spirits I'm the keeper of

2707.8 --> 2712.599
that flame when everybody else

2709.8 --> 2712.599
surrenders the

2714.72 --> 2722.5989999999997
flame I keep it I don't surrender it

2718.64 --> 2724.8799999999997
like and I'll die keeping that

2722.599 --> 2726.6400000000003
flame maybe even

2724.88 --> 2728.2000000000003
prematurely

2726.64 --> 2731.319
but I will keep the

2728.2 --> 2733.4399999999996
flame I will keep that original Purity

2731.319 --> 2737.8
and honesty and just like I'm not

2733.44 --> 2744.76
adapting to this crap not adapting to

2737.8 --> 2744.76
any political Universal system of

2745.559 --> 2752.76
thinking it's like if the truth rolling

2750.119 --> 2757.88
out literally become

2752.76 --> 2757.88
systematic then I will start opposing it

2758.64 --> 2762.68
because everything that's just

2760.119 --> 2765.44
completely systematic like doesn't mean

2762.68 --> 2765.44
anything anymore

2765.68 --> 2772.68
anyway it's usually just like

2770.04 --> 2774.68
oh

2772.68 --> 2777.52
fed

2774.68 --> 2780.5989999999997
virtue towards people that have already

2777.52 --> 2780.599
learned that lesson

2782.48 --> 2788.04
anyway right when something is true has

2786.0 --> 2791.76
to be said immediately just like Dr

2788.04 --> 2794.0
Shiva says if it's afterward when it's

2791.76 --> 2796.96
already the damage is already done it's

2794.0 --> 2799.559
just veined virtue

2796.96 --> 2801.04
signaling like oh oh yeah we got to do

2799.559 --> 2802.96
the right thing yeah yeah you should

2801.04 --> 2805.0
have said that when it actually mattered

2802.96 --> 2807.88
when people could have actually you

2805.0 --> 2807.88
could have spared their

2811.079 --> 2817.0
lives

2812.88 --> 2819.2400000000002
Andra arra native what D what are you

week it's mostly on Fridays but I mean

3135.4 --> 3140.76
it's even been on

3136.72 --> 3143.04
Mondays so it's just like I don't know

3140.76 --> 3146.3590000000004
but I I pretty much bump into him like

3143.04 --> 3150.4
every week at infow Wars and during like

3146.359 --> 3150.4
the Alex Jones Show slot

3150.559 --> 3153.559
too

3153.88 --> 3162.04
uh God there's this video game ad thing

3158.68 --> 3166.0
going on I mean it's a pretty it's a

3162.04 --> 3169.359
clever campaign The Alex Jones video

3166.0 --> 3172.64
game but I mean oh my god do they

3169.359 --> 3174.44
overplay the ad like oh my God it's just

3172.64 --> 3175.839
after hearing that one day it already

3174.44 --> 3179.119
starts to make me

3175.839 --> 3179.119
nauseous it's

3179.16 --> 3186.68
like they like aimed that [ __ ] game

3182.2 --> 3189.24
at adiq and less it's

3186.68 --> 3192.319
terrible like what the

3189.24 --> 3195.24
[ __ ] it's like this is the game that's

3192.319 --> 3197.4
going to make a [ __ ] feel like they're

3195.24 --> 3199.799
smart or something is that is that what

3197.4 --> 3203.7200000000003
you're trying to do with what what the

3199.799 --> 3205.799
[ __ ] but whatever man it does seem like

3203.72 --> 3209.1189999999997
it's based on like a

3205.799 --> 3211.16
like really successful franchises like

3209.119 --> 3213.6800000000003
uh what is it like the old Super

3211.16 --> 3216.92
Nintendo Nintendo

3213.68 --> 3219.04
games Contra it's like a contra type

3216.92 --> 3222.839
game that's modified with a bunch of

3219.04 --> 3225.64
samples and themed around the globalist

3222.839 --> 3228.72
and but I mean

3225.64 --> 3232.4
God if I those sound samples that I

3228.72 --> 3234.839
heard in the ads are real like holy [ __ ]

3232.4 --> 3236.119
could have you done like a worse voice

3234.839 --> 3239.16
over

3236.119 --> 3241.799
Alex could you have possibly done the

3239.16 --> 3244.72
voice over any

3241.799 --> 3248.88
worse he made like everything like a

3244.72 --> 3251.2799999999997
Cheesy dumbass joke of himself but it's

3248.88 --> 3253.76
his voice like what the [ __ ] is the

3251.28 --> 3255.599
point you're

3253.76 --> 3258.76
like

3255.599 --> 3263.4
oversizing yourself it's not funny

3258.76 --> 3263.4
anymore Alex it's just [ __ ]

3264.079 --> 3267.079
[ __ ]

3268.119 --> 3274.48
like why couldn't you just actually use

3271.0 --> 3277.4
your original sound

3274.48 --> 3279.0
bites of like you going Super Saiyan

3277.4 --> 3281.28
would have been pretty awesome but

3279.0 --> 3283.64
actually the sound bite and yes you've

3281.28 --> 3287.0
overplayed that already by playing it

3283.64 --> 3290.16
every [ __ ] day on ads for like 10

3287.0 --> 3292.68
years yeah whatever you're already doing

3290.16 --> 3295.2
that anyway so why did why didn't you

3292.68 --> 3299.8799999999997
just use original sound bites for for

3295.2 --> 3301.52
the game instead of like really dumb and

3299.88 --> 3305.44
not

3301.52 --> 3308.28
genuine reaying it making it sound

3305.44 --> 3310.88
really disingenuous and stupid why the

3308.28 --> 3314.559
[ __ ] did he do

3310.88 --> 3314.559
that I don't get

3316.96 --> 3324.48
it I have to endure that [ __ ] and I mean

3321.64 --> 3326.5589999999997
if he hadn't done the sound bite so

3324.48 --> 3329.839
terribly I would have

3326.559 --> 3331.559
probably freaking bought the game I mean

3329.839 --> 3333.48
it seems like it's a pretty decently

3331.559 --> 3338.44
developed Contra type

3333.48 --> 3338.44
game but I mean the sound bites are

3339.88 --> 3344.799
atrocious and I'm complaining about it

3342.44 --> 3347.68
nobody here gives a [ __ ] I don't even

3344.799 --> 3347.68
know why I'm doing

3352.799 --> 3358.44
it cuz you guys are

3356.319 --> 3359.68
logically talking about something

3358.44 --> 3363.64
completely

3359.68 --> 3368.52
different or just not talking in

3363.64 --> 3371.7599999999998
chat but yeah that the Alex Jones video

3368.52 --> 3375.68
game seems like it's a pretty solid game

3371.76 --> 3378.88
but it has the worst conceivable sound

3375.68 --> 3380.0389999999998
bites that Alex Jones personally screwed

3378.88 --> 3384.039
up for

3380.039 --> 3387.7990000000004
you I mean it is the worst possible

3384.039 --> 3391.92
sound bites he could have done it's like

3387.799 --> 3395.24
so bad it will probably make you turn

3391.92 --> 3397.88
off the sound to play it because

3395.24 --> 3399.1189999999997
visually and gameplay wise it looks like

3397.88 --> 3402.799
it's pretty

3399.119 --> 3409.039
good looks kind of nice looks

3402.799 --> 3409.0389999999998
cool but holy [ __ ] those sound bites are

3410.92 --> 3417.96
[ __ ] I really hope there's an option

3413.68 --> 3421.5589999999997
menu in which you can turn those off or

3417.96 --> 3424.88
even better replace them with the actual

3421.559 --> 3424.88
original recorded

3425.16 --> 3431.7599999999998
sounds where he's act where Alex Jones

3427.839 --> 3436.24
is actually angry and Loud

3431.76 --> 3439.5200000000004
Like and not [ __ ] faking it like oh

3436.24 --> 3440.4799999999996
oh people want to hear that do they oh

3439.52 --> 3445.28
let

3440.48 --> 3448.079
me do it again except this time it's not

3445.28 --> 3452.039
I think I'm so popular by doing it and

3448.079 --> 3455.0
it makes it sound like super lame and

3452.039 --> 3459.28
disingenuous congratulation Alex you

3455.0 --> 3462.52
literally ruined your entire meme your

3459.28 --> 3467.8390000000004
your entire meme Legacy you literally

3462.52 --> 3472.0389999999998
like [ __ ] it up to death you literally

3467.839 --> 3474.4
[ __ ] your own memes to death by doing

3472.039 --> 3477.079
this and I'm really starting to wonder

3474.4 --> 3479.92
whether you did that on

3477.079 --> 3481.7200000000003
purpose it's like that was that the only

3479.92 --> 3485.28
condition you could get the money for it

3481.72 --> 3487.7599999999998
or something I mean I bet that Alex is

3485.28 --> 3490.2000000000003
getting swarmed by like big Mega backers

3487.76 --> 3492.039
that are just offering like tricky deals

3490.2 --> 3494.2
like oh we'll do business with you you

3492.039 --> 3496.559
just have to humiliate yourself in this

3494.2 --> 3499.2799999999997
and that way like is that actually

3496.559 --> 3501.48
happening because otherwise Alex is just

3499.28 --> 3503.52
like

3501.48 --> 3506.119
self-destructive if that wouldn't be the

3503.52 --> 3509.16
case if he's not just getting

3506.119 --> 3510.6400000000003
manipulated by Bankers like like doing

3509.16 --> 3513.5589999999997
sneaky

3510.64 --> 3515.0389999999998
bailouts like to prevent him from

3513.559 --> 3517.1600000000003
collapsing and they're just trying to

3515.039 --> 3519.3190000000004
[ __ ] him up make him [ __ ] himself up is

3517.16 --> 3521.5989999999997
that going on I like what the hell is

3519.319 --> 3521.599
going

3530.24 --> 3537.3999999999996
on I assumed it would be sale what

3534.119 --> 3539.96
platform is is it on it's a self it's a

3537.4 --> 3539.96
game you

3540.44 --> 3546.96
download and it's

3542.4 --> 3549.28
like two3 of the ads now on Alex Jones

3546.96 --> 3552.2400000000002
Channel and all that on every

3549.28 --> 3555.1600000000003
channel is just shoving that game and

3552.24 --> 3558.1189999999997
stupid ads about it in your face I mean

3555.16 --> 3560.5989999999997
it's the worst possible advertisement he

3558.119 --> 3565.599
could have ever thought

3560.599 --> 3568.799
of it's so dumb and tasteless

3565.599 --> 3568.799
it's just [ __ ]

3573.039 --> 3578.1600000000003
up and I really don't get it I mean the

3575.559 --> 3581.92
game could have been like if he just had

3578.16 --> 3584.839
the game and he just not used original

3581.92 --> 3586.64
sound bites and not his stupid

3584.839 --> 3589.64
[ __ ]

3586.64 --> 3589.64
self-conscious

3589.76 --> 3592.96
unenthusiastic

3591.44 --> 3596.96
lame

3592.96 --> 3599.96
remake of the sound B like never ever do

3596.96 --> 3603.2
that Alex I mean seriously bash your

3599.96 --> 3606.119
face against the wall at full force

3603.2 --> 3608.5589999999997
before you ever consider doing something

3606.119 --> 3608.559
like that

3609.48 --> 3619.119
again just take the original sound bites

3615.16 --> 3622.1189999999997
nobody cares about how lame you are

3619.119 --> 3622.119
now

3623.559 --> 3631.2000000000003
yeah it's a meme it was cool because of

3629.16 --> 3635.24
the real

3631.2 --> 3638.2
energy you redoing it not having the

3635.24 --> 3640.0389999999998
energy being super self-aware feeling

3638.2 --> 3642.68
that you're all a

3640.039 --> 3644.2000000000003
badass it's like the worst thing you

3642.68 --> 3648.2799999999997
could have ever

3644.2 --> 3648.2799999999997
done you [ __ ]

3653.52 --> 3660.16
idiot

3656.2 --> 3660.16
it could have been a like epic

3663.119 --> 3669.4
game just strip The Sound

3666.4 --> 3673.359
Library the [ __ ] samples just erase

3669.4 --> 3678.799
that crap and just put in the

3673.359 --> 3682.2799999999997
original sound bites from the original

3678.799 --> 3683.2
memes yeah the actual original recording

3682.28 --> 3687.6400000000003
just

3683.2 --> 3690.48
that of Alex just being like yeah the

3687.64 --> 3694.16
real thing I mean you guys at the ad

3690.48 --> 3696.64
Department in N forars use his those

3694.16 --> 3700.5989999999997
exact sound bites all over the place for

3696.64 --> 3703.52
your weird hybrid hybridized movie ads

3700.599 --> 3706.48
and some of them are even like kind of

3703.52 --> 3710.0389999999998
funny they have one now that's freaking

3706.48 --> 3713.52
hilarious from all these weird Star Wars

3710.039 --> 3715.6400000000003
sort of deep fake hybrid ads now we have

3713.52 --> 3719.16
one and at Jaba the

3715.64 --> 3722.0789999999997
Hut where in Star Wars uh

3719.16 --> 3724.359
6 where Luke Skywalkers gives a message

3722.079 --> 3727.6800000000003
to ja the hot but now instead of Luke

3724.359 --> 3729.64
Skywalker's message it's Alex Jones

3727.68 --> 3732.839
talking about being you this is what

3729.64 --> 3736.68
it's like this is what I

3732.839 --> 3738.92
am that was perfect I mean that's a

3736.68 --> 3740.799
really [ __ ] funny ad and every time I

3738.92 --> 3742.559
see it I have to giggle because it's

3740.799 --> 3745.92
actually really

3742.559 --> 3748.279
funny that's good you

3745.92 --> 3748.279
of the

3748.96 --> 3754.119
memes what they [ __ ] did with the

3751.2 --> 3757.68
sound bites in video game was a

3754.119 --> 3760.6400000000003
gigantic horror

3757.68 --> 3762.319
Fest it will not make me want to keep

3760.64 --> 3765.92
playing it will make me want to

3762.319 --> 3768.74
periodically throw up and how [ __ ]

3765.92 --> 3771.92
gross it

3768.74 --> 3776.359
[Music]

3771.92 --> 3776.359
is anyway

3776.799 --> 3783.119
I think you are pissed off at someone's

3779.24 --> 3785.0789999999997
voice over in some ad yeah no but I'm

3783.119 --> 3790.279
pissed off because of

3785.079 --> 3792.48
artistic reasons yeah it hurts my

3790.279 --> 3796.16
artist's

3792.48 --> 3796.16
soul that he did

3797.079 --> 3801.0
that and it's so

3803.279 --> 3806.279
unnecessary

3810.92 --> 3816.119
oh you got buffering

3813.279 --> 3817.72
drer so yeah it's just an artist beef I

3816.119 --> 3820.2000000000003
just think it's like why the [ __ ] would

3817.72 --> 3820.2
you do

3823.319 --> 3829.2
that so

3825.88 --> 3832.839
yeah oh I guess nobody cares oh well I

3829.2 --> 3835.0789999999997
[ __ ] care I care about it I care I

3832.839 --> 3837.4
watch that show

3835.079 --> 3840.3590000000004
and now that those [ __ ] ads with

3837.4 --> 3842.92
those terrible terrible sound bites keep

3840.359 --> 3846.68
slapping in my face it's like he's just

3842.92 --> 3850.839
trying to scare everybody away like go

3846.68 --> 3855.24
away Alex Jones just like go away let me

3850.839 --> 3857.7599999999998
die please before I humiliate myself

3855.24 --> 3857.7599999999998
even

3862.96 --> 3866.2
worse right

3880.319 --> 3885.92
right but the game itself seems just

3882.799 --> 3885.92
fine sort of a

3887.24 --> 3890.72
contra so

3893.16 --> 3900.799
see

3895.68 --> 3903.64
ah so yeah if Alex actually manages to

3900.799 --> 3907.4
figure this [ __ ] retardation that he

3903.64 --> 3910.5589999999997
Unleashed out and maybe we can even fix

3907.4 --> 3914.4
it I mean sound libraries in games are

3910.559 --> 3916.7200000000003
very fixable you can very easily replace

3914.4 --> 3916.7200000000003
all of

3918.0 --> 3922.799
it

3919.88 --> 3925.6800000000003
yeah and maybe Alex will actually make a

3922.799 --> 3927.839
little bit more effort this time

3925.68 --> 3930.0389999999998
but probably not you'll probably just

3927.839 --> 3933.92
leave it as is and

3930.039 --> 3938.3590000000004
then it will die out much quicker I mean

3933.92 --> 3941.2400000000002
it's a paid for game you can hear how

3938.359 --> 3944.92
unbelievably terrible the sound bites

3941.24 --> 3948.4399999999996
are of the game before you pay for

3944.92 --> 3951.2400000000002
it yeah good [ __ ]

3948.44 --> 3954.119
luck people don't want to play video

3951.24 --> 3957.2
games with horrendously terribly

3954.119 --> 3962.44
executed sound bites they don't want

3957.2 --> 3962.4399999999996
that it makes them feel cheap and

3963.68 --> 3966.8399999999997
[Music]

3976.799 --> 3981.44
[ __ ] all right anyway I hope you

3979.2 --> 3983.5989999999997
guys are appreciating the show even

3981.44 --> 3985.079
though I'm talking about Alex Jones

3983.599 --> 3989.96
stuff

3985.079 --> 3992.799
with my artist artists criticism because

3989.96 --> 3995.2400000000002
I'm just weird and I care about these

3992.799 --> 3999.799
things even though nobody else in the

3995.24 --> 3999.799
[ __ ] world cares about it I still

4003.52 --> 4007.559
do and that's just the way it

4007.72 --> 4012.799
is right but I could definitely start

4011.119 --> 4014.359
talking about something else it's just

4012.799 --> 4016.319
very hard to start talking about

4014.359 --> 4017.64
something else when something is still

4016.319 --> 4020.4
on your

4017.64 --> 4023.319
heart and I've been like actually really

4020.4 --> 4023.319
agitated over

4024.88 --> 4029.96
this it's not a good thing when you're

4027.52 --> 4033.799
like watching a show you watch for like

4029.96 --> 4036.64
20 years and then stly just start

4033.799 --> 4039.0
yelling at the ads there are a couple of

4036.64 --> 4042.1189999999997
ads that are so horrendous that I just

4039.0 --> 4042.119
start yelling at

4042.359 --> 4045.92
them cuz I hate

4052.64 --> 4059.96
now he's not in some ad it's a video

4055.92 --> 4063.0
game ad of a video game based on Alex

4059.96 --> 4065.839
Jones in Alex Jones video game which is

4063.0 --> 4067.319
like obviously based on the Contra video

4065.839 --> 4070.24
game

4067.319 --> 4072.7599999999998
franchise and it's all themed with Alex

4070.24 --> 4076.7599999999998
Jones against the globalists and he did

4072.76 --> 4076.76
sound bites for the game that are

4080.44 --> 4085.43
horrendous no I have not done any work

4083.2 --> 4088.5699999999997
on my video game

4085.43 --> 4088.5699999999997
[Music]

4091.88 --> 4096.279
development and I didn't plan to

4102.839 --> 4105.839
anyway

4112.159 --> 4116.04
Alex Jones is an ad in

4122.319 --> 4128.4800000000005
L don't understand why people are

4125.159 --> 4131.599999999999
interested in that game anyway

4128.48 --> 4134.12
uh well because it is a pretty decent

4131.6 --> 4136.400000000001
Contra game and Contra is like a pretty

4134.12 --> 4136.4
cool

4146.92 --> 4153.719
game and it supports the infow wars blah

4151.4 --> 4153.719

hello how you doing today fig fig out

4493.6 --> 4498.719
the Earth is flat

4495.96 --> 4500.52

4498.719 --> 4503.08
flat

4500.52 --> 4507.4400000000005
Earth pretty much anything you attempt

4503.08 --> 4507.44
to do in this world requires a flat

4519.36 --> 4525.199
Earth you are not a commi what

4525.32 --> 4530.159
all right yeah you're not a leftist

4552.199 --> 4557.08
again

4553.8 --> 4560.84
you were listening to the video

4557.08 --> 4563.08
game seconds ago it sounds funny it is

4560.84 --> 4567.04
kind of funny but it's just that Alex

4563.08 --> 4567.04
didn't use original sound

4568.44 --> 4573.36
bites it just re recorded it so it's

4572.08 --> 4576.5599999999995
like

4573.36 --> 4579.36
7076 will commence again like no that

4579.36 --> 4584.199
Pierce Morgan recording damn it don't do

4582.639 --> 4588.4800000000005

4588.48 --> 4593.759999999999
stupid and need everything in the gamees

4591.239 --> 4595.759999999999
done like that it's like oh my God why

4593.76 --> 4599.400000000001
did you just use the original sound bite

4595.76 --> 4601.56
that sounds so terrible now it sounds

4599.4 --> 4604.799999999999
lame and

4601.56 --> 4604.8
gross and

4612.08 --> 4615.08
gay

4620.239 --> 4624.0
they eat my ass is different sound it's

4622.44 --> 4625.96
all different

4624.0 --> 4629.56
sounding he

4625.96 --> 4632.56
re-recorded all of his

4629.56 --> 4636.88
[Music]

4632.56 --> 4636.88
memes and which just ruined

4639.239 --> 4646.44
it it's like a guy bragging about his

4642.52 --> 4651.400000000001
own me mes and in the process ruining

4646.44 --> 4651.4
those memes that's basically what it

4662.719 --> 4670.679
is guess who's back a do

4666.6 --> 4670.679
yeah duper is always welcome

4672.0 --> 4675.0
here

4678.84 --> 4684.0
glad that somebody here agrees with me

4681.239 --> 4687.5599999999995
about a detail of Alex

4684.0 --> 4690.0
Jones oh I'm not the only one that even

4687.56 --> 4691.6
thinks about that guy and know I don't

4690.0 --> 4694.719
think about him all day long it's just

4691.6 --> 4698.56
that Alex Jones did freaking wake me up

4694.719 --> 4701.92
like when I really desperately needed

4698.56 --> 4705.719
it like right when I was

4701.92 --> 4708.88
like pretty much at the bottom of the

4705.719 --> 4711.32
darkness is where it wanted to go I

4708.88 --> 4713.12
could have slipped in and really gone

4711.32 --> 4715.92
all the way

4713.12 --> 4717.96
down but Alex Jones like Snapped me out

4715.92 --> 4721.88
of it and showed me like no no no you

4717.96 --> 4724.88
can actually go the exact opposite way

4721.88 --> 4726.52
with it was like what you can do that

4724.88 --> 4728.56
but I thought that you can't that it's

4726.52 --> 4731.719
old fashion you're not supposed to do

4728.56 --> 4734.92
yeah you can [ __ ] do that it was all

4731.719 --> 4734.92
a ruse it was all just

4735.12 --> 4740.5199999999995
indoctrination this thanks to Alex he

4737.76 --> 4742.8
literally gave me that first societal

4740.52 --> 4745.92
snap out of

4742.8 --> 4747.96
it right and before that I had like been

4745.92 --> 4749.84
confronted with flat Earth and then like

4747.96 --> 4750.96
oh yeah yeah and then forgot about it I

4749.84 --> 4754.1990000000005
couldn't handle

4750.96 --> 4758.679
it but you could even say that because

4754.199 --> 4761.5599999999995
Alex Jones snapped me out of societal

4758.679 --> 4765.08
blanket comfort blanket like

4761.56 --> 4769.84
that I was also able to take it further

4765.08 --> 4769.84
and really let the Flat Earth sink

4772.32 --> 4779.159
in Alex Jones

4775.36 --> 4779.159
helped help me get

4791.84 --> 4797.04
there I give Alex credit for waking me

4795.0 --> 4801.639
up yeah exactly so we're in the same

4797.04 --> 4801.639
package he did wake me up he absolutely

4802.32 --> 4807.88
did I'll never forget man like first

4805.32 --> 4810.5599999999995
time I saw the movie terror storm like

4807.88 --> 4815.719
holy [ __ ] that's I didn't even know

4810.56 --> 4815.719
anything about 9/11 and it was like

4815.8 --> 4822.2390000000005
what wait what like this is a mo like a

4819.8 --> 4827.12
science fiction movie or something right

4822.239 --> 4827.12
like no no no it isn't

4828.32 --> 4836.88
what like it scared the [ __ ] out of

4832.32 --> 4836.88
me but I mean it needed to

4838.239 --> 4845.12
happen right and then end game I really

4842.04 --> 4846.84
kind of like moved in with the Infowars

4845.12 --> 4850.04
during end

4846.84 --> 4851.719
game and then peaked at The Obama

4850.04 --> 4854.719
Deception

4851.719 --> 4857.639
like I still remember like Alex Jones

4854.719 --> 4861.04
made The Obama Deception like

4857.639 --> 4863.4400000000005
before Obama even became president like

4861.04 --> 4865.5199999999995
that was amazing I still I'll never

4863.44 --> 4868.199
forget it around

4865.52 --> 4871.2390000000005
2008 it's also the year that like that

4868.199 --> 4874.28
giant uh gold crisis happened and I made

4871.239 --> 4877.08
a lot of money because of that well made

4874.28 --> 4880.679
a lot I basically invested some in gold

4877.08 --> 4880.679
and then it did shoot up

4881.04 --> 4887.28
dramatically I mean I love lost all that

4883.4 --> 4888.879999999999
profit in the me spent it not lost it I

4887.28 --> 4891.92
don't

4888.88 --> 4895.56
gamble but

4891.92 --> 4895.56
yeah those were good

4897.04 --> 4900.96
times it's also around the time of his

4899.56 --> 4903.4400000000005
Super Saiyan

4900.96 --> 4905.8
rant like when all those types of memes

4903.44 --> 4905.799999999999
started

4909.8 --> 4915.320000000001
up sounds pretty nasty being woke up by

4912.84 --> 4917.8
Alex Jones hey waking up is a nasty

4915.32 --> 4921.0
business yeah that's the point the

4917.8 --> 4924.679
dreams are all nice and cozy reality is

4921.0 --> 4924.679
freaking nasty that's the whole

4929.0 --> 4937.96
point Dr ugar you don't have to like him

4933.44 --> 4937.96
okay just respect

4941.159 --> 4947.96
him you know what I mean lumpy gas gets

4945.08 --> 4947.96
it

4948.52 --> 4953.6
okay I mean just respect him for what he

4951.44 --> 4955.0
originally did you don't have to respect

4953.6 --> 4959.52
him

4955.0 --> 4959.52
now it's kind of wasted at

4960.84 --> 4966.04
all or not wasted he keeps wasting it

4963.88 --> 4968.52
all it's like he keeps throw he keeps

4966.04 --> 4970.84
humiliating himself I think Alex is like

4968.52 --> 4973.120000000001
kind of neurotic with it he just can't

4970.84 --> 4975.84
help it he just keeps humiliating

4973.12 --> 4979.08
himself maybe he thinks that if he just

4975.84 --> 4981.96
keeps humiliating himself that he that

4979.08 --> 4985.48
people will give him money it's I don't

4981.96 --> 4985.4800000000005
know what the [ __ ] going on with

4989.159 --> 4997.0
him but I mean Alex has got some

4992.679 --> 5000.52
psychological issues recently it's it's

4997.0 --> 5004.48
palpable it could just be the winter dip

5000.52 --> 5004.4800000000005
thing typically

5009.8 --> 5015.56
yeah thanks I'm really thank you lumpy

5012.08 --> 5015.5599999999995
gas for standing with me on

5015.639 --> 5019.159000000001
this gives me a good feeling now I'm

5017.88 --> 5023.8
going to check your account if you're

5019.159 --> 5023.799999999999
actually the real one yeah you are thank

5024.239 --> 5029.44
God but thank you thank you for being

5026.84 --> 5033.12
there and sharing that with me they not

5029.44 --> 5035.638999999999
the only one like I get it man like my

5033.12 --> 5039.0
the title of my show is literally about

5035.639 --> 5041.32
how we screwing up right now okay it's

5039.0 --> 5041.32
just

5041.44 --> 5047.5199999999995
that if I hadn't bumped into him I I

5045.4 --> 5049.679
don't know what the hell I'd be right

5047.52 --> 5053.2390000000005
now where I'd

5049.679 --> 5053.2390000000005
be what I'd be

5054.96 --> 5061.4
doing in retrospect I might have

5057.6 --> 5063.88
actually had some halfway good life but

5061.4 --> 5066.12
I mean I would have probably gotten

5063.88 --> 5067.96
better chances of like getting married

5066.12 --> 5069.76
and all that but it would have still

5067.96 --> 5072.4800000000005
been like a

5069.76 --> 5075.320000000001
mess like if I hadn't bumped into Alex

5072.48 --> 5077.08
Jones I would have probably had betterer

5075.32 --> 5078.84
chance getting married quick having

5077.08 --> 5081.32
children and then they would have either

5078.84 --> 5083.6
become gay or died from

5081.32 --> 5086.599999999999
vaccines that would have happened if I

5083.6 --> 5089.320000000001
hadn't bumped into Alex Jones because I

5086.6 --> 5091.56
didn't know about vaccines that much I

5089.32 --> 5094.4
was recommended against it like from the

5091.56 --> 5097.679
family at the

5094.4 --> 5099.92
time but I never took it serious that

5097.679 --> 5102.96
much I just like followed the advice of

5099.92 --> 5106.2390000000005
my peers my

5102.96 --> 5109.32
family I wasn't really afraid but if it

5106.239 --> 5113.32
was for Alex Jones I would have probably

5109.32 --> 5116.799999999999
just been like a [ __ ] liberal

5113.32 --> 5116.799999999999
idiot with that

5117.28 --> 5123.0
[ __ ] I don't know if I've ever would

5120.239 --> 5127.4
have gotten like a a good water field

5123.0 --> 5131.719
that I've been using like 20 years

5127.4 --> 5135.839999999999
now not 15 plus

5131.719 --> 5138.719
years and all this stuff that has like

5135.84 --> 5141.84
re like provably

5138.719 --> 5143.719
improved the quality of my being and

5141.84 --> 5146.56
what I can

5143.719 --> 5150.119
achieve just by cleaning myself up like

5146.56 --> 5153.6
that I have I owe that to him I wouldn't

5150.119 --> 5154.839999999999
have gone and done that if it wasn't for

5153.6 --> 5159.119000000001
Alex

5154.84 --> 5159.119000000001
Jones if I hadn't bumped into

5160.52 --> 5166.159000000001
him by the way there's the weird part I

5163.6 --> 5168.719
bumped into him through a guy I knew

5166.159 --> 5171.879999999999
from the goldsmithing school who later

5168.719 --> 5174.36
by the way became a cop for a bit and I

5171.88 --> 5177.08
think he's now like a brewer but that's

5174.36 --> 5179.28
the guy who basically really recommended

5177.08 --> 5181.199
him to me for the first time and I had

5179.28 --> 5184.4
like no idea about any of

5181.199 --> 5186.599999999999
it cuz I was just a li liberal weenie

5184.4 --> 5189.239
that was still contemplating whether I

5186.6 --> 5190.719
was actually gay or not that's kind of

5189.239 --> 5194.5599999999995

5197.52 --> 5201.92

5203.6 --> 5213.39
