so whether today well right now there's

108.439 --> 115.15899999999999
a nice blue spot flying over but even a

112.64 --> 115.159
little bit of

116.399 --> 123.07900000000001
sun that just moved in because it's been

121.24 --> 126.83999999999999
raining

123.079 --> 126.83999999999999
nonstop since I woke

132.84 --> 138.8
up and pretty much all night and evening

136.44 --> 141.04
it was just raining Raining

138.8 --> 144.04000000000002
Raining really big

141.04 --> 145.519
clouds moving over but yeah with some

144.04 --> 150.04
blue spots in

145.519 --> 150.04
between like right there

155.519 --> 161.36
sure it's going to be raining again soon

158.319 --> 162.319
I kind of just hope it will maybe stop

161.36 --> 166.87900000000002
for a

162.319 --> 168.28
bit later when when I round out the show

166.879 --> 169.959
because I still need to go out for

168.28 --> 172.959
groceries

169.959 --> 172.959
later

175.159 --> 181.84
anyway it is Wednesday the 29th of May

179.159 --> 181.84
2020

189.08 --> 193.92000000000002
24 temperature 17Â°

196.72 --> 207.64
C 100% precipitation wow okay 70 7%

205.599 --> 210.39999999999998
humidity

207.64 --> 212.72
yeah I guess I have to like

210.4 --> 215.76000000000002
go out on my bicycle right when there's

212.72 --> 219.879
a blue spot

215.76 --> 223.599
overhead take my umbrella with me for

219.879 --> 227.0
certainty I mean it's not super stormy

223.599 --> 227.0
or anything so it should be

227.48 --> 230.48
doable

233.28 --> 241.72
right hello KP first in chat good to see

238.2 --> 241.72
you we're doing it

242.36 --> 247.43900000000002
live yeah we are I'm always doing it

252.959 --> 258.919
live if I bring an umbrella it might not

256.28 --> 261.919
ring well then I definitely bring an

258.919 --> 261.919
umbrella

275.28 --> 281.15999999999997
I mean I certainly will prefer over

277.68 --> 281.16
ringing an umbrella and it not

281.4 --> 287.75899999999996
raining or I mean I will prefer that

284.32 --> 290.199
over going without an umbrella and it

287.759 --> 292.12
raining so yeah definitely going to

290.199 --> 296.12
bring an umbrella

292.12 --> 296.12
then anyhow

305.24 --> 310.12
so hope everybody's doing okay out

310.919 --> 317.79999999999995
there I heard there's some crazy storms

314.08 --> 322.75899999999996
that were there yesterday in America

317.8 --> 324.6
again saw some storm footage like really

322.759 --> 327.68
Savage

324.6 --> 331.639
rainstorms with wind that is just like

327.68 --> 331.639
yeah almost ripping things apart but

331.72 --> 339.16
there no flying walls

335.039 --> 339.15999999999997
and and roofs just

343.24 --> 346.24
yet

347.88 --> 354.8
um right but yeah

351.44 --> 359.0
uh I thought yesterday show

354.8 --> 361.96000000000004
was intense it started out kind of funny

359.0 --> 364.479
with the whole Bigfoot thing and me of

361.96 --> 366.84
course in my weird way like taking it

364.479 --> 366.84
really

376.319 --> 380.12
serious I got some nice

382.0 --> 387.88
comments but yeah I thought yes it was a

384.319 --> 387.88
really great show

391.919 --> 399.28
and and basically me raising that

395.479 --> 402.199
question right like what are these

399.28 --> 403.75899999999996
ancient megal megalithic structures like

402.199 --> 406.96000000000004
what are

403.759 --> 409.44
they I've been thinking about it I

406.96 --> 411.68
watched Eric Dub's video from two days

409.44 --> 417.36
ago about the

411.68 --> 417.36
cathars that was pretty dry but

418.039 --> 423.599
interesting also ref referencing how

421.84 --> 425.56
macowski

423.599 --> 431.0
his

425.56 --> 431.0
research so Eric is keeping track of

431.8 --> 435.479
that but yeah

438.68 --> 444.16
like there is some kind of Paradigm with

441.599 --> 444.15999999999997
that stuff

446.319 --> 452.52000000000004
happening like the cathars and the

448.759 --> 454.91900000000004
gnostics and how they see God of this

452.52 --> 457.87899999999996
world actually being evil and all that

454.919 --> 461.31899999999996
and it's kind of tough to like fit it

457.879 --> 464.8
all like the structure of that kind of

461.319 --> 469.12
insight makes logical sense to a

464.8 --> 469.12
degree doesn't feel complete

470.84 --> 476.159
though and the way the cathars dealt

473.36 --> 476.159
with it

478.24 --> 483.12
seems like

480.759 --> 483.12
very

488.039 --> 491.599
impractical but yeah there's just a lot

490.159 --> 494.599
to think

491.599 --> 497.199
about and I'm thinking also about like

494.599 --> 499.96
in the face of that

497.199 --> 503.039
like the cathars would have definitely

499.96 --> 507.0
seen the ancient structures that could

503.039 --> 509.96
have been there put by God as well then

507.0 --> 514.399
being put there by the wrong God

509.96 --> 517.1999999999999
who who could arguably be seen as the

514.399 --> 519.0
devil so there's this

517.2 --> 521.32
weird

519.0 --> 523.88
perception

521.32 --> 527.48
dichotomy about the ancient structures

523.88 --> 530.12
that logically some might see them as

527.48 --> 532.9590000000001
being built by God as

530.12 --> 535.2
like they're like still part of the

532.959 --> 537.279
Garden of Eden there that they are

535.2 --> 541.44
what's

537.279 --> 541.4399999999999
left and man has torn it down

542.2 --> 547.8000000000001
because of the power of delusion they

545.279 --> 549.56
want everything to be forgotten they

547.8 --> 551.8389999999999
don't want to be reminded about that

549.56 --> 554.8
fact and so they can control people's

551.839 --> 556.8800000000001
minds and dictate what what they should

554.8 --> 558.88
believe where they come from

556.88 --> 562.56
Etc but then there's the other

558.88 --> 562.56
perspective the more cathar

563.48 --> 568.0
perspective that this entire world is

566.2 --> 571.5600000000001
basically a

568.0 --> 573.72
seduction based hell to keep you in here

571.56 --> 576.959
just a very Grim view

573.72 --> 579.8000000000001
really and then they're basically

576.959 --> 581.92
structures from the devil to keep you

579.8 --> 583.3599999999999
seduced to stay here because I mean

581.92 --> 586.76
these things are

583.36 --> 591.04
glorious they have this

586.76 --> 591.04
empowering capabilities and all

591.88 --> 597.4399999999999
that and then they would be like a

594.839 --> 602.44
pinnacle of Seduction to keep you here

597.44 --> 602.44
to want to know more to want to come

604.36 --> 610.44
back and so there is this dichotomy and

607.72 --> 614.24
it

610.44 --> 616.7600000000001
I I've started staring at it I can now

614.24 --> 616.76
explain

616.839 --> 624.0
it but I can't really figure it

620.959 --> 627.1199999999999
out I can't really

624.0 --> 630.36
tell I

627.12 --> 632.8
just the only thing is that in a way I

630.36 --> 632.8000000000001
kind of

633.68 --> 639.04
reject that form of looking at at things

636.639 --> 639.04
in the

639.519 --> 645.36
world like I kind of refuse to actually

642.639 --> 648.72
look at this world as being

645.36 --> 651.399
hell I'd much rather see it as a

648.72 --> 656.8000000000001
pandemonium something

651.399 --> 656.8
that heaven and hell are fighting over

662.519 --> 669.8
although I think that even that idea is

665.519 --> 673.6
really Catholic in origin I might be

669.8 --> 677.3199999999999
mistaken so maybe the Catholicism kind

673.6 --> 677.32
of got to me at a young

677.56 --> 684.5999999999999
age presented a view that just seemed

680.36 --> 684.6
the most reasonable to me

692.0 --> 697.32
but really as I've learned more I I'd

695.279 --> 700.92
really have to say that I'd prefer to

697.32 --> 702.1600000000001
think as these buildings as just part of

700.92 --> 706.279
the

702.16 --> 708.56
original creation process and thereby

706.279 --> 710.76
even potentially remnants of the Garden

708.56 --> 710.76
of

711.16 --> 718.0
Eden because everything about

714.76 --> 719.72
those about that architecture like

718.0 --> 721.16
everything about it is good good and

719.72 --> 726.8000000000001
positive and

721.16 --> 729.8389999999999
empowering it uses just knowledge

726.8 --> 732.92
like seemingly infinite knowledge of

729.839 --> 735.639
architecture and stone and

732.92 --> 739.399
electricity

735.639 --> 740.639
to empower people it empowers people it

739.399 --> 743.6
empowers

740.639 --> 746.279
life and devices like the pyramid

743.6 --> 749.36
hydroelectric

746.279 --> 753.6
generator as as that little video that I

749.36 --> 755.72
shared explains like that's a really

753.6 --> 760.12
positive thing that's a positive thing

755.72 --> 763.519
for life so how could you ever see that

760.12 --> 767.04
as an evil

763.519 --> 769.9590000000001
seduction when it's literally

767.04 --> 773.24
empowering living things isn't

769.959 --> 777.8
that what we

773.24 --> 777.8
seek while we're alive

779.56 --> 784.2399999999999
isn't even like God of Christianity

782.639 --> 787.72
supposed to be

784.24 --> 789.48
empowering you see and and through such

787.72 --> 792.399
resonance

789.48 --> 795.6800000000001
frequency approach it's like how could

792.399 --> 798.88
you ever see it as actually being of the

795.68 --> 800.3599999999999
devil when the devil seems to be tearing

798.88 --> 804.199
it

800.36 --> 806.48
down people that like clearly identify

804.199 --> 806.4799999999999
as

807.76 --> 815.04
deranged without feelings meal maniacal

811.6 --> 815.0400000000001
power hungry

831.959 --> 838.88
Etc all right so it's it's a complicated

835.12 --> 840.839
situation and it's like stumbled upon

838.88 --> 842.92
this realization about the ancient

840.839 --> 846.32
megalithic

842.92 --> 849.24
structures and then like the The Logical

846.32 --> 850.519
consequences and like the different ways

849.24 --> 854.519
of looking at

850.519 --> 854.519
it the gnostics and the

854.56 --> 860.68
cathars and

857.56 --> 863.5999999999999
regular typical Christianity which I

860.68 --> 867.199
mean it is arguably coming forth from

863.6 --> 869.639
anti what I call anti-christianity

867.199 --> 871.5999999999999
Christianity that is

869.639 --> 874.6800000000001
like

871.6 --> 880.12
blatantly going

874.68 --> 883.079
wrong but the roots of where that came

880.12 --> 886.88
from is all grounded in like very

883.079 --> 889.7199999999999
sensible pure type of looking at way way

886.88 --> 892.72
of looking at things so it's just really

889.72 --> 892.72
complicated

906.04 --> 912.0
right anyway hope that some other people

908.279 --> 912.0
might join the chat

930.48 --> 933.1990000000001
what do you

935.079 --> 939.5999999999999
think do you agree with the cathars and

938.319 --> 942.0
the

939.6 --> 945.0400000000001
gnostics would you then argue that the

942.0 --> 947.839
me megalithic structures are bit built

945.04 --> 951.04
by the God of this world that's

947.839 --> 954.5600000000001
actually like the gatekeeper of

951.04 --> 956.199
hell and are they there to seduce us to

954.56 --> 958.56
to to stay

956.199 --> 961.079
here is that the reason why they're

958.56 --> 962.959
there or would you believe with a more

961.079 --> 965.92
conventional

962.959 --> 967.319
perspective but thereby realizing that

965.92 --> 971.0
they could

967.319 --> 974.8389999999999
be like the original buildings designed

971.0 --> 978.72
by God stemming from the Garden of Eden

974.839 --> 983.0400000000001
period that might have

978.72 --> 986.0400000000001
yeah been carried through time and maybe

983.04 --> 986.04
maintained

992.48 --> 998.04
for a while and they're now like they're

994.68 --> 1000.6389999999999
getting assaulted maybe the

998.04 --> 1002.88
maintainers were there or are still

1000.639 --> 1005.9590000000001
there but then they seem to be at war

1002.88 --> 1008.8389999999999
with with the great

1005.959 --> 1013.04
evil that seems to want to torch these

1008.839 --> 1015.399
types of structures and just destroy

1013.04 --> 1019.16
them and that's been going on for a

1015.399 --> 1019.16
couple of hundred years

1022.88 --> 1029.039
hello moon rover am I religious no not

1027.039 --> 1032.36
really and it's a kind of a stupid

1029.039 --> 1035.28
pointless question in the face of the

1032.36 --> 1037.6789999999999
dichotomy that I put down and asked a

1035.28 --> 1037.6789999999999
question

1040.839 --> 1045.4389999999999
about Thursday vegan oh you watched the

1043.679 --> 1050.16
pyramid video and you thought it was

1045.439 --> 1052.96
ridiculous I'm sure you did numpty

1050.16 --> 1052.96
that's all

1061.12 --> 1067.3999999999999
fine I thought it was a great

1063.28 --> 1071.12
translation and elaboration of my

1067.4 --> 1073.52
conception of pyramids as hydroelectric

1071.12 --> 1076.36
generators I mean the hashtags been in

1073.52 --> 1080.36
my list for quite a while before that

1076.36 --> 1080.36
video even popped up

1091.14 --> 1099.43
[Music]

1111.72 --> 1119.039
right but yeah let's just say moon rover

1114.799 --> 1122.6
by the Wikipedia numpty [Â __Â ] standard

1119.039 --> 1125.96
version of what it means to be religious

1122.6 --> 1128.799
then yeah I do I am religious I do

1125.96 --> 1131.76
believe in a god higher

1128.799 --> 1135.039
power that's right that's what they say

1131.76 --> 1138.679
religious means which is like ridiculous

1135.039 --> 1138.679
definition really

1138.84 --> 1144.799
cuz atheists are religious too and bards

1141.799 --> 1144.799
are definitely

1144.84 --> 1149.039
religious doesn't have to do with a

1158.32 --> 1163.6
God not actually oh yes Thursday vegan

1162.28 --> 1166.559
I'm

1163.6 --> 1169.3999999999999
sure you just shove

1166.559 --> 1171.84
it shove it back under under water you

1169.4 --> 1175.2
push that bow back underwater you keep

1171.84 --> 1175.1999999999998
doing that

1187.74 --> 1190.92
[Music]

1211.28 --> 1218.0
all right so wonder if anybody's going

1213.64 --> 1218.0
to show up here except these Bard

1225.96 --> 1229.96
trolls okay

1231.64 --> 1234.3600000000001
you're out of

1241.4 --> 1247.679
here hey Mike sedun an actual person

1245.88 --> 1249.2
that knows how to communicate like a

1247.679 --> 1253.679
normal human

1249.2 --> 1253.679
being good to see you

1272.76 --> 1276.799
how's the weather over there

1297.6 --> 1302.559
all right I might start chowing down my

1303.32 --> 1309.48
Illuminati it's cooling

1306.4 --> 1313.4
off same as me oh

1309.48 --> 1313.4
okay rainy all the

1314.4 --> 1321.48
time yeah this mayze certainly has been

1318.679 --> 1325.76
unusually

1321.48 --> 1329.1200000000001
wet compared to like the last few

1325.76 --> 1331.24
years and like in the last decade over

1329.12 --> 1334.8799999999999
bro it's been

1331.24 --> 1338.48
like like a pre-summer like

1334.88 --> 1340.679
very sunny and warm and yeah it doesn't

1338.48 --> 1342.64
seem to be like that at all this year I

1340.679 --> 1349.64
mean it did warm up a

1342.64 --> 1349.64
bit but this constant rain [Â __Â ] man damn

1350.36 --> 1354.52
yeah maybe where you're at now it's

1352.64 --> 1357.1200000000001
raining over there but like it's been

1354.52 --> 1359.36
raining here like almost continue now

1357.12 --> 1362.6399999999999
not continually but a

1359.36 --> 1365.559
lot every day a little bit at least in

1362.64 --> 1365.5590000000002
the in the entire

1367.919 --> 1373.3200000000002
month I really hope June's going to be

1370.32 --> 1373.32
better

1383.0 --> 1389.0
all right I'm going to take a

1385.0 --> 1389.0
bite cheers

1409.39 --> 1412.709
[Music]

1424.52 --> 1429.12
big question okay sure

1448.48 --> 1453.32
what have you concern consider a big

1466.48 --> 1471.64
question we know burn the old buildings

1469.679 --> 1474.64
down and why

1471.64 --> 1474.64
right

1474.72 --> 1480.72
uh is that the question or is

1477.72 --> 1480.72
that

1492.24 --> 1499.919
what we know who we no we don't

1495.559 --> 1499.9189999999999
necessarily know but

1505.039 --> 1511.32
it's probably not going to be any group

1507.559 --> 1513.9189999999999
that's up to any good it's probably

1511.32 --> 1513.9189999999999
satanic

1518.159 --> 1522.48
related do I think God is watching

1521.24 --> 1524.64
everything you

1522.48 --> 1526.24
do

1524.64 --> 1530.3200000000002
uh

1526.24 --> 1530.32
yeah God is watching

1530.76 --> 1537.72
everyone but I mean not as you would

1534.84 --> 1539.799
think of God like a person I mean it's

1537.72 --> 1542.24
not a man that's just like remote

1539.799 --> 1545.24
viewing

1542.24 --> 1545.24
me

1545.36 --> 1552.559
like but I mean all of this is his

1549.24 --> 1552.559
design all of

1552.84 --> 1561.0
it like this is the roll out of his

1556.52 --> 1561.0
movie of his Matrix is

1569.32 --> 1577.1589999999999
experiment so yeah God sees everything

1572.48 --> 1577.159
that's right or not even seeing

1579.2 --> 1586.1200000000001
knowing so moon rover what's your bloody

1584.24 --> 1588.799
point with that

1586.12 --> 1591.2399999999998
[Â __Â ] before I kick you out because all

1588.799 --> 1593.559
you ever do is just ask whiny [Â __Â ]

1591.24 --> 1596.559
troll

1593.559 --> 1599.559
questions but but please make your

1596.559 --> 1599.559
point

1611.43 --> 1614.479
[Music]

1615.0 --> 1621.76
please who melted the older buildings

1619.32 --> 1624.2
uh yeah I I'm not buying into that at

1621.76 --> 1624.2
all Mike

1630.96 --> 1637.72
sidun there's no melting of buildings I

1634.559 --> 1639.6789999999999
I I don't buy into meltology at all like

1637.72 --> 1642.08
not even

1639.679 --> 1644.039
remotely I think it's kind of ridiculous

1642.08 --> 1647.84
that so many people are buying into that

1644.039 --> 1650.1589999999999
I mean it it just it's just a no just a

1647.84 --> 1650.1589999999999
no

1651.12 --> 1658.399
right there might be disasters that have

1655.399 --> 1658.399
happened

1660.36 --> 1667.1999999999998
like if it's if it's mostly Stone if

1664.32 --> 1669.799
there's what seems to be like

1667.2 --> 1672.919
melting well that's not going to be

1669.799 --> 1675.24
fire that would have had to been have

1672.919 --> 1679.64
been some kind

1675.24 --> 1683.519
of sound based dist stabilization like

1679.64 --> 1686.8400000000001
maybe heavy sound frequencies that would

1683.519 --> 1688.64
literally turn it into

1686.84 --> 1692.6789999999999
putty

1688.64 --> 1695.919
temporarily so like heavy

1692.679 --> 1698.88
sonic boom that's just never stopping

1695.919 --> 1700.8400000000001
that would like and just destabilize

1698.88 --> 1705.3200000000002
like

1700.84 --> 1705.32
basically I what has a name damn

1705.76 --> 1713.32
it I forgot what the name was for

1709.6 --> 1717.279
that but it it's yeah there could have

1713.32 --> 1717.279
been some kind of like

1718.279 --> 1724.559
supersonic event that happened that

1721.2 --> 1727.2
destabilized some

1724.559 --> 1729.399
structures but heat has absolutely

1727.2 --> 1732.8400000000001
nothing to do with it so to call it

1729.399 --> 1732.84
melted is like

1735.519 --> 1740.039
ridiculous I would say structurally

1741.64 --> 1747.3200000000002
form and also it's very plain and

1744.6 --> 1749.519
obvious that it not everything was hit

1747.32 --> 1749.519
by

1752.76 --> 1758.8799999999999
it so what could that be it could be

1756.679 --> 1761.88
potentially like Sonic

1758.88 --> 1763.64
weapons like who knows what happened in

1761.88 --> 1765.159
those ancient times when the structures

1763.64 --> 1767.76
were at their full

1765.159 --> 1769.7600000000002
bloom there could have been giant Wars

1767.76 --> 1772.2
between

1769.76 --> 1774.48
people that had all kinds of insane

1772.2 --> 1775.559
technology and like Sonic not just

1774.48 --> 1778.84
lightning

1775.559 --> 1781.84
weapons but also Sonic weapons like okay

1778.84 --> 1783.519
we're just going to take this giant

1781.84 --> 1786.9599999999998
Stone

1783.519 --> 1789.3990000000001
dish like thing and just like sound like

1786.96 --> 1791.919
have a very specific R I don't know man

1789.399 --> 1794.2399999999998
I'm just improvising just Sonic weapons

1791.919 --> 1794.24
and

1796.76 --> 1800.95
just and then suddenly like everything

1799.12 --> 1802.2399999999998
starts shaking and

1800.95 --> 1805.279
[Music]

1802.24 --> 1807.08
a just completely

1805.279 --> 1809.76
malform a

1807.08 --> 1812.039
structure then it collapses partially or

1809.76 --> 1815.44
it weakens and then people can break

1812.039 --> 1815.44
through the walls kind of

1816.44 --> 1822.64
thing I I mean that's probably the

1819.48 --> 1826.799
farthest extent to this whole

1822.64 --> 1831.76
mology but the universal idea of the

1826.799 --> 1834.76
mlist that like oh no the entire all the

1831.76 --> 1837.919
mountains they were all

1834.76 --> 1841.6
buildings and then they all just melted

1837.919 --> 1845.039
no just no the evidence speaks against

1841.6 --> 1848.8799999999999
it I mean if you actually check the

1845.039 --> 1848.8799999999999
Rocks it's just a

1854.039 --> 1862.72
no I mean if there is some kind of

1858.72 --> 1862.72
reshaping from an original

1862.84 --> 1869.76
state you have evidence for it it's just

1867.08 --> 1873.8799999999999
like if you have

1869.76 --> 1877.48
metal let's just say silver even with

1873.88 --> 1881.2
iron if you then hammer it or bend it in

1877.48 --> 1883.3990000000001
some way well guess what there is

1881.2 --> 1889.0800000000002
literally evidence in

1883.399 --> 1890.1999999999998
it that it was Bent by how the

1889.08 --> 1893.84
the

1890.2 --> 1896.159
metal yeah metal what do you call that

1893.84 --> 1898.76
granules like within it like how they

1896.159 --> 1901.279
are shaped like you can see that it was

1898.76 --> 1903.48
B you can literally like with the

1901.279 --> 1906.72
microscope check it

1903.48 --> 1909.1200000000001
out see where the tensions are and then

1906.72 --> 1911.559
back engineer exactly what the original

1909.12 --> 1911.559
shape

1914.72 --> 1922.6390000000001
was you can figure that out about things

1918.08 --> 1925.08
about metal and about rock too I mean

1922.639 --> 1927.08
you can see what it was originally and

1925.08 --> 1929.519
with mountains it's like no there's

1927.08 --> 1932.6789999999999
nothing

1929.519 --> 1933.84
been malformed like this is just the

1932.679 --> 1937.3200000000002
original

1933.84 --> 1940.399
state and thereby the idea of oh it was

1937.32 --> 1941.8799999999999
all just architecture it's just like no

1940.399 --> 1944.5189999999998
just

1941.88 --> 1949.8400000000001
no there would

1944.519 --> 1949.84
be more evidence like in

1950.48 --> 1954.279
everything like even if you're like

1952.679 --> 1956.159
going to like

1954.279 --> 1961.039
excavate or

1956.159 --> 1965.48
mine materials you'd literally bump into

1961.039 --> 1970.96
structures as you're mining all the

1965.48 --> 1970.96
time and I mean like total structures

1971.0 --> 1978.32
like and and we

1973.48 --> 1978.32
don't that's not how it's arranged

1983.679 --> 1989.3600000000001
right so I hope that answers your

1985.559 --> 1989.36
question which is a decent

1995.96 --> 2003.32
question right and I mean I think that

2000.48 --> 2006.6390000000001
there also have been

2003.32 --> 2009.76
like actual Fire based melting

2006.639 --> 2009.76
situations probably

2009.96 --> 2013.6000000000001
using what do you call

2014.0 --> 2020.2
that uh like

2017.24 --> 2023.159
solar reflectors to like create the

2020.2 --> 2026.679
solar death Rays they have probably been

2023.159 --> 2030.2
used also like with some castles that

2026.679 --> 2032.279
seem to have actually been like scorched

2030.2 --> 2035.039
and

2032.279 --> 2038.919
burnt but not to the scale where you

2035.039 --> 2042.039
could say like oh all the mountains

2038.919 --> 2045.1200000000001
no like

2042.039 --> 2048.359
locally solar death Rays have probably

2045.12 --> 2050.6389999999997
been used on a military industrial scale

2048.359 --> 2053.7599999999998
at some point probably the Phoenicians

2050.639 --> 2055.639
probably on giant flotillas that just

2053.76 --> 2057.3990000000003
had these things that would just like

2055.639 --> 2060.599
move it up to the coast wait till the

2057.399 --> 2060.5989999999997
sun comes out and just

2062.079 --> 2068.119
like basically

2064.399 --> 2070.879
just burn it all melt it all like all

2068.119 --> 2072.599
the Rocks just explode because that's

2070.879 --> 2075.639
what happens when you put a solar death

2072.599 --> 2079.599
rate on a rock it like it

2075.639 --> 2079.599
explodes except if it's like

2080.879 --> 2085.0789999999997
lava like there are some rocks that are

2083.159 --> 2087.079
just that can handle like infinite

2085.079 --> 2089.639
amount of heat and they just don't react

2087.079 --> 2092.76
at all but a lot of stone does it it

2089.639 --> 2094.96
will like explode

2092.76 --> 2098.0400000000004
shatter and there is evidence that that

2094.96 --> 2100.599
has happened and there's evidence of

2098.04 --> 2103.599
Sonic

2100.599 --> 2106.119
destabilization sound based Weaponry

2103.599 --> 2110.119
that probably like through vibration

2106.119 --> 2115.4
destabilized the the structure of rock

2110.119 --> 2115.4
materials which caused it to sort of

2118.079 --> 2121.079
melt

2122.68 --> 2128.359
locally and what else yeah and of course

2126.44 --> 2130.56
flooding just

2128.359 --> 2133.52
overall flooding but the flooding itself

2130.56 --> 2136.44
would have had very little impact on the

2133.52 --> 2136.44
old megalithic

2141.4 --> 2147.52
structures cuz they were

2143.76 --> 2149.88
built to be able to withstand that

2147.52 --> 2152.319
potentially they're just foundationally

2149.88 --> 2155.0
too strong it it didn't do

2152.319 --> 2158.0
anything except maybe bury them under

2155.0 --> 2158.0
mud

2159.48 --> 2165.56
but they like the flood did not like

2162.4 --> 2169.319
cause the Giants megalithic struck just

2165.56 --> 2172.4
to to basically topple or

2169.319 --> 2174.119
anything so even any kind of Mega

2172.4 --> 2176.48
torrent that would have happened when

2174.119 --> 2178.319
the water was rising or or

2176.48 --> 2181.4
dropping because there's going to be

2178.319 --> 2184.4
turbulence like even those did not like

2181.4 --> 2188.48
top all the megalithic structures or big

2184.4 --> 2188.48
huge statues or anything

2193.61 --> 2199.1600000000003
[Music]

2194.96 --> 2201.359
many mountains were once volcanoes oh

2199.16 --> 2201.359
yeah

2207.68 --> 2214.68
sure rocks and B yeah no sure

2220.64 --> 2227.1189999999997
mountains have had volcanic activities

2223.56 --> 2230.0
within them and since there does seem to

2227.119 --> 2230.0
be like land

2231.56 --> 2236.64
shifting continental drift is what they

2234.2 --> 2238.3999999999996
called it and I mean yeah you can think

2236.64 --> 2242.0789999999997
of the Earth as a model underneath it

2238.4 --> 2245.6800000000003
and to justify why it's drifting or

2242.079 --> 2248.3590000000004
whatever but there are things drifting

2245.68 --> 2251.0
somehow it's shifting I'd call it

2248.359 --> 2251.0
continental

2255.079 --> 2258.5600000000004
shift but

2259.2 --> 2266.48
uh it could like what how the volcanoes

2263.079 --> 2269.8
work that is kind of a mystery though I

2266.48 --> 2272.599
mean you could consider that volcanoes

2269.8 --> 2275.599
long-term activity could

2272.599 --> 2279.599
potentially help to shape mountains even

2275.599 --> 2282.48
deposit some typical Volcan Remnant

2279.599 --> 2284.56
materials inside of those mountains by

2282.48 --> 2287.2400000000002
just pushing it in

2284.56 --> 2290.839
there and

2287.24 --> 2294.2
then the whole thing might

2290.839 --> 2298.0789999999997
shift and then suddenly the

2294.2 --> 2300.4399999999996
volcanic ejection point is no longer

2298.079 --> 2302.88
under the mountain and then basically

2300.44 --> 2305.76
there's no more volcanic activity

2302.88 --> 2308.76
because I don't think that like volcanic

2305.76 --> 2308.76
activity

2313.24 --> 2318.4799999999996
is local in a way this sounds kind of

2315.76 --> 2320.8
weird by the way but I mean I think that

2318.48 --> 2323.599
volcanic activity is

2320.8 --> 2326.3590000000004
actually something that is

2323.599 --> 2329.0
more that is created

2326.359 --> 2331.2799999999997
differently I've argued like way back

2329.0 --> 2333.44
that volcanoes might be happening by

2331.28 --> 2339.44
some

2333.44 --> 2339.44
uh electrical process like in local

2339.48 --> 2343.68
induction

2341.28 --> 2346.2000000000003
somehow and if that is the case if there

2343.68 --> 2348.04
are just like induction points that just

2346.2 --> 2350.48
happen in the earth it's because of the

2348.04 --> 2352.72
overall electric

2350.48 --> 2354.44
situation well then if there's a

2352.72 --> 2357.56
continental

2354.44 --> 2361.079
shift then there is let's just say

2357.56 --> 2363.68
there's a point somewhere and there is

2361.079 --> 2366.119
this induction happening so there's

2363.68 --> 2368.52
regular volcanic activity that happens

2366.119 --> 2370.2400000000002
over that spot there's like mountains of

2368.52 --> 2374.16
volcano

2370.24 --> 2376.9199999999996
Etc well if that land then shifts

2374.16 --> 2379.7599999999998
because of continental shift the

2376.92 --> 2382.8
induction point doesn't move with it

2379.76 --> 2387.2400000000002
potentially the induction Point might be

2382.8 --> 2387.2400000000002
like the energy how they just

2387.68 --> 2393.52
arrange it might just happen in an in a

2390.8 --> 2395.599
literal position and not because of the

2393.52 --> 2398.16
circumstances of the materials that are

2395.599 --> 2400.6800000000003
shifting away so the point where

2398.16 --> 2403.48
volcanic activity might happen might

2400.68 --> 2406.24
stay in the exact same location as the

2403.48 --> 2409.04
land over time shifts

2406.24 --> 2412.68
away this could even explain several

2409.04 --> 2416.16
things like how a volcanic Ridge just

2412.68 --> 2417.96
happens right it's like oh volcano here

2416.16 --> 2420.56
starts a little island oh now the

2417.96 --> 2423.8
volcano later there and now there and

2420.56 --> 2425.7599999999998
now there could be because the point

2423.8 --> 2428.2000000000003
where the induction happens that causes

2425.76 --> 2429.44
the volcanic lava

2428.2 --> 2432.0
Heating and

2429.44 --> 2434.28
pressure might be staying at the same

2432.0 --> 2437.68
spot or who knows might even be shifting

2434.28 --> 2438.5600000000004
in a very specific pattern in ukan space

2437.68 --> 2441.04
I

2438.56 --> 2442.92
mean it's going to be a very specific

2441.04 --> 2445.2799999999997
solid pattern

2442.92 --> 2448.2400000000002
because you don't just have random

2445.28 --> 2452.3190000000004
volcanoes pop up everywhere see they

2448.24 --> 2452.319
seem to be following specific

2452.76 --> 2458.0400000000004
lines but if

2455.16 --> 2460.8799999999997
continents shift well the volan the

2458.04 --> 2462.4
volcano seem to be staying at the same

2460.88 --> 2466.48
ukian

2462.4 --> 2469.8
spot so that a volcano might

2466.48 --> 2472.44
emerge ukian wise at the same location

2469.8 --> 2475.4
as the land has shifted

2472.44 --> 2479.16
away with the original volcano that was

2475.4 --> 2485.2400000000002
right on top of the spot now have become

2479.16 --> 2485.24
inactive and moving away from the spot

2489.04 --> 2493.72
they start very deep yeah I'm

2492.16 --> 2498.24
sure

2493.72 --> 2499.839
so hope that answers that

2498.24 --> 2502.839
complicated

2499.839 --> 2502.839
geological

2504.56 --> 2508.599
question subduction

2516.24 --> 2520.16
what for

2573.2 --> 2578.72
Haw are a series of cocan yeah yeah

2580.559 --> 2586.119
but I

2582.24 --> 2590.7599999999998
mean do multiple volcanoes erupt at the

2586.119 --> 2590.76
same location at the same time

2609.4 --> 2614.359
or is it always one that erupts

2638.28 --> 2641.3590000000004
[Music]

2666.04 --> 2670.079
ah for

2710.23 --> 2713.2690000000002
[Music]

2718.44 --> 2723.64
15 separate volcano wow that's a lot

2728.44 --> 2733.079
but I asked a question though about

2730.92 --> 2737.92
their

2733.079 --> 2741.3590000000004
activity do they just randomly go

2737.92 --> 2741.359
off back and

2751.95 --> 2755.0499999999997
[Music]

2755.92 --> 2758.92
forth

2779.63 --> 2782.679
[Music]

2785.92 --> 2789.88
for for

2834.52 --> 2838.8
H

2836.559 --> 2842.44
okay that's interesting when we're over

2838.8 --> 2842.44
so yeah multiple at the same

2845.839 --> 2848.839
time

2875.839 --> 2879.7999999999997
for for

2908.48 --> 2914.96
oh okay yeah thanks moon rover for

2912.359 --> 2916.5589999999997
the halfway decent questions I

2914.96 --> 2919.4
appreciate

2916.559 --> 2923.7200000000003
that I really want like where is

2919.4 --> 2923.7200000000003
everybody at where my wrenches

2933.52 --> 2938.72
at been going for almost 50

2952.16 --> 2957.92
minutes oh Mike sedun got his coffee

2955.119 --> 2957.92
it's been 20

2965.72 --> 2969.68
minutes for

3001.0 --> 3007.079
okay so yeah apparently volcanoes was

3004.079 --> 3009.88
the conversation and gave an idea on how

3007.079 --> 3009.88
volcanoes

3011.92 --> 3018.28
might or rather a a

3015.72 --> 3023.3999999999996
question CU I don't know for sure but

3018.28 --> 3027.6800000000003
are volcanoes basically tied into the

3023.4 --> 3031.4
crust into the continent into the land

3027.68 --> 3035.8799999999997
itself like a a chemical storage that

3031.4 --> 3038.4
then migrates with the plate with the

3035.88 --> 3042.599
continent as it

3038.4 --> 3042.599
shifts or is it rather

3046.64 --> 3055.2
a a spatial phenomenon almost that just

3051.839 --> 3058.64
happens because of well

3055.2 --> 3060.52
electric webs

3058.64 --> 3062.799
webs yeah I don't even know how to how

3060.52 --> 3064.0
to how to explain this because of just

3062.799 --> 3067.0
how

3064.0 --> 3070.16
energy is happening in the

3067.0 --> 3073.559
realm and that however continent shift

3070.16 --> 3073.5589999999997
that like the points

3073.599 --> 3079.96
where the lava conditions are formed

3076.48 --> 3084.319
that it it stays in its ukian position

3079.96 --> 3088.48
while the land shifts like we don't know

3084.319 --> 3091.44
that it's an interesting

3088.48 --> 3094.119
thing to basically find

3091.44 --> 3096.559
out it would tell us a lot about the

3094.119 --> 3098.92
very yeah about the nature of the realm

3096.559 --> 3101.1600000000003
itself like like what these volcanoes

3098.92 --> 3103.6800000000003
are are

3101.16 --> 3107.1189999999997
these things that are happening because

3103.68 --> 3111.7599999999998
of the electrical nature of the realm

3107.119 --> 3115.079
that just volcanoes are

3111.76 --> 3117.6400000000003
created because of the electrical

3115.079 --> 3119.6800000000003
influence that they would always be a

3117.64 --> 3123.72
thing that happens in the

3119.68 --> 3127.3999999999996
realm or are they indeed

3123.72 --> 3129.64
like purely material based and just

3127.4 --> 3132.2400000000002
because of the circumstances of

3129.64 --> 3135.7599999999998
materials that are in a very specific

3132.24 --> 3139.3999999999996
spot they were just designed to be in

3135.76 --> 3141.96
there that caused them to be

3139.4 --> 3145.119
volcanic and then it would move with the

3141.96 --> 3148.52
continents cuz it's like part of the of

3145.119 --> 3148.52
the soil part of The Rock

3148.68 --> 3153.799
if the rock shifts then the Volcan the

3151.119 --> 3157.76
volcano shifts with

3153.799 --> 3162.96
it it would be good to to figure that

3157.76 --> 3162.96
out o Zep or

3169.52 --> 3173.28
wumble right so

3173.44 --> 3178.319
yeah but yeah that's has nothing to do

3176.64 --> 3181.7599999999998
of this have anything to do with the

3178.319 --> 3184.839
title so I did figure out an interesting

3181.76 --> 3187.76
title the Ancients used electricity to

3184.839 --> 3189.72
empower life we Ed it to emulate life I

3187.76 --> 3192.079
actually had a better name for it but it

3189.72 --> 3192.9199999999996
I could not make it fit in the title

3192.079 --> 3195.76
which

3192.92 --> 3198.4
sucks cuz the way I actually wanted to

3195.76 --> 3201.4
say it is the ancient used

3198.4 --> 3201.4
electricity

3203.2 --> 3207.64
to uh what is it

3208.24 --> 3211.24
yeah to

3209.319 --> 3214.079
stimulate right

3211.24 --> 3216.839
not ancient used electricity to

3214.079 --> 3221.88
stimulate life we use it

3216.839 --> 3225.7599999999998
to simulate life stimulate

3221.88 --> 3229.1600000000003
simulate is there's there's one t

3225.76 --> 3232.2000000000003
difference I thought that was like way

3229.16 --> 3234.0789999999997
more aesthetic but I couldn't make it

3232.2 --> 3237.04
fit in the title it's like nothing I

3234.079 --> 3238.52
could do so I couldn't fit in there so

3237.04 --> 3240.72
this is the way I'm going to have to say

3238.52 --> 3243.72
it and yeah too

3240.72 --> 3246.839
bad but yeah just think about

3243.72 --> 3248.9599999999996
it all this ancient

3246.839 --> 3253.7599999999998
architecture seems

3248.96 --> 3253.76
very Tesla knowledge

3254.4 --> 3259.92
oriented ancient stone technology was

3257.4 --> 3259.92
used

3260.92 --> 3268.359
to to gather electricity to do stuff

3264.44 --> 3268.359
with it that stimulates

3270.04 --> 3277.079
life right while we in the modern era we

3274.48 --> 3280.559
use electricity completely

3277.079 --> 3283.0
different we use it more like

3280.559 --> 3285.2000000000003
switchboards and

3283.0 --> 3288.24
computers but even like how it started

3285.2 --> 3291.5589999999997
out it's just all like switchboard type

3288.24 --> 3293.839
setup away from test that just like okay

3291.559 --> 3297.3190000000004
we're just draping a field everywhere

3293.839 --> 3299.359
which would have stimulated life

3297.319 --> 3303.359
but instead of stimulating the Life by

3299.359 --> 3303.359
spreading the electrical

3303.88 --> 3313.839
potential we trap it

3309.079 --> 3316.8390000000004
within microcosms that we create metal

3313.839 --> 3319.5589999999997
microcosms in which they end up

3316.839 --> 3324.599
simulating

3319.559 --> 3326.96
life so yeah we simulate life with

3324.599 --> 3329.92
electricity in this era

3326.96 --> 3333.4
computers like are there to like mimic

3329.92 --> 3336.28
people so that's we're using electricity

3333.4 --> 3339.2000000000003
to simulate life I mean this is just a

3336.28 --> 3342.88
real thing the ancient weren't using

3339.2 --> 3346.68
electricity in that way at all they were

3342.88 --> 3350.28
mainly using it to empower life

3346.68 --> 3350.2799999999997
to stimulate

3353.599 --> 3358.6800000000003
it such a different way of using

3366.24 --> 3374.0389999999998
it at 27 electricity yeah sure us I know

3371.2 --> 3378.799
that's what the official story

3374.039 --> 3378.7990000000004
tells that this absolute nonsense I

3379.079 --> 3388.119
mean ancient Egyptians used electricity

3384.119 --> 3388.119
too lamps

3392.039 --> 3396.4
they used the

3393.599 --> 3398.96
pyramids like a Tesla coil and then they

3396.4 --> 3400.96
had just lamps with batteries that could

3398.96 --> 3406.039
just be lit

3400.96 --> 3410.52
up all day long or all night

3406.039 --> 3414.1600000000003
long thanks to the Tesla

3410.52 --> 3416.92
like pyramid electric field

3414.16 --> 3420.0789999999997
generator so yeah this very cute that

3416.92 --> 3423.52
officially it was invented in

3420.079 --> 3423.52
18227 but

3423.92 --> 3431.48
uh it's been around for a much longer

3428.48 --> 3435.319
time they found ancient

3431.48 --> 3438.0
lamps there's depictions in heroglyph

3435.319 --> 3441.0
literally it's right

3438.0 --> 3445.119
there there's the bdad

3441.0 --> 3447.44
batteries official find Etc and I'm

3445.119 --> 3451.0
quite damn certain that they did find

3447.44 --> 3451.0
lamps and then they just like

3451.72 --> 3456.2799999999997
oh they did the same [Â __Â ] as they did

3454.52 --> 3458.64
with the Giants because it's like oh no

3456.28 --> 3462.48
we can't get too

3458.64 --> 3464.799
real can't get people too enthusiastic

3462.48 --> 3470.079
we can't move too far away from the

3464.799 --> 3470.079
official story of how we claim history

3472.16 --> 3477.799
happened and I think Egyptians having

3474.72 --> 3480.5989999999997
Tesla coil like electric lamps is kind

3477.799 --> 3482.799
of An Inconvenient history for the

3480.599 --> 3487.88
official history narrative and so they

3482.799 --> 3487.88
probably removed some something here and

3491.72 --> 3498.3999999999996
there oh the light bulb thingy yeah the

3495.079 --> 3498.4
light bulb thingy

3505.119 --> 3508.119
indeed

3535.039 --> 3539.079
for for

3579.039 --> 3582.039
ah

3595.39 --> 3598.44
[Music]

3600.92 --> 3604.4
all right

3627.68 --> 3630.96
okay so yeah that's it that's pretty

3629.92 --> 3634.079
much

3630.96 --> 3635.559
it I guess I can round out the show and

3634.079 --> 3637.799
flat earthers don't seem to be

3635.559 --> 3640.079
interested anymore in my show it's just

3637.799 --> 3643.079
a bunch of bards so thanks a lot

3640.079 --> 3643.079
everybody

3676.48 --> 3679.48
now

3697.799 --> 3702.64
Bard is yeah okay see you later Zep

3704.88 --> 3709.2000000000003
Tippy I mean I'm not complaining about

3707.319 --> 3711.839
your behavior today or anything I mean

3709.2 --> 3714.4399999999996
you all seem to be fine it's just that

3711.839 --> 3716.24
where the hell is my wrenches where

3714.44 --> 3717.7200000000003
where did Mike sedun Go said he was

3716.24 --> 3720.319
going to get some coffee that's like

3717.72 --> 3724.359
half an hour ago

3720.319 --> 3724.359
now over half an hour

3738.4 --> 3742.4
ago anyway

3748.48 --> 3755.52
right but

3751.359 --> 3757.7599999999998
uh yeah I'm thinking of electricity in

3755.52 --> 3760.559
more specific terms now and just

3757.76 --> 3762.48
realizing like yeah what modern

3760.559 --> 3766.0
electronic

3762.48 --> 3769.2
age I think

3766.0 --> 3772.799
Electronics specifically as a word

3769.2 --> 3775.96
is more yeah is properly

3772.799 --> 3777.64
specific that electronics are there to

3775.96 --> 3779.48
emulate

3777.64 --> 3782.52
life

3779.48 --> 3787.559
like basically leads to switchboards

3782.52 --> 3793.079
effect computers and those are

3787.559 --> 3794.76
like mental things yeah mental processes

3793.079 --> 3796.799
that are being

3794.76 --> 3801.4
simulated or

3796.799 --> 3801.4
emulated and that is the nature of

3801.44 --> 3806.92
electronics it emulates like living

3805.039 --> 3809.279
intelligence

3806.92 --> 3811.039
but like a robot Etc like and that's

3809.279 --> 3813.16
what it leads to like a complete

3811.039 --> 3816.2400000000002
simulation of a living being that is

3813.16 --> 3819.5989999999997
like a robot autonomous Etc you know

3816.24 --> 3822.799
like in Star Trek a holographic person

3819.599 --> 3825.2400000000002
or a

3822.799 --> 3827.72
Android it's all learning to be human

3825.24 --> 3830.72
like that's Electronics

3827.72 --> 3833.68
that's emulating simulating life that's

3830.72 --> 3837.16
the nature of that using electricity

3833.68 --> 3839.359
like that the same time there's other

3837.16 --> 3842.52
ways of using electricity which have

3839.359 --> 3844.319
been uncovered by Tesla and William

3842.52 --> 3846.599
Reich

3844.319 --> 3848.44
and all these

3846.599 --> 3852.1600000000003
other

3848.44 --> 3854.92
like not super well

3852.16 --> 3856.8799999999997
known people that have just figured that

3854.92 --> 3859.2400000000002
out about electricity how there's health

3856.88 --> 3861.6800000000003
benefits and that it like actually

3859.24 --> 3862.8799999999997
stimulates life that life itself has

3861.68 --> 3865.68
electrical

3862.88 --> 3868.52
fields and then that is a complete

3865.68 --> 3871.64
completely different approach of using

3868.52 --> 3874.0389999999998
electricity it it is the ancient way of

3871.64 --> 3876.16
using it that's how the ancient

3874.039 --> 3880.1600000000003
architecture seems to be

3876.16 --> 3882.68
functioning it stimulates

3880.16 --> 3886.279
life it empowers

3882.68 --> 3889.72
it gives off fields that are like

3886.279 --> 3889.72
healthy to be

3892.319 --> 3898.359
around and that's like a very distinct

3895.799 --> 3903.0
difference in like how to utilize

3898.359 --> 3905.279
electricity one is like field casting

3903.0 --> 3908.16
type of electricity it just spreads it

3905.279 --> 3910.799
around it just creates fields in which

3908.16 --> 3914.7599999999998
energy just resonates and can be

3910.799 --> 3916.68
absorbed and the other one engages it

3914.76 --> 3919.48
and like forces it to

3916.68 --> 3923.839
become

3919.48 --> 3927.68
microscopic and start

3923.839 --> 3930.5589999999997
simulating processes complex

3927.68 --> 3934.8799999999997
processes and it's such a distinctly

3930.559 --> 3934.88
different form of utilization of

3938.319 --> 3943.24
electricity and technically they could

3941.68 --> 3946.0789999999997
combine I

3943.24 --> 3949.68
mean you can have a

3946.079 --> 3952.44
computer that's just alive because there

3949.68 --> 3957.44
is a Tesla coil that's just casting

3952.44 --> 3960.039
energy and it can just use that

3957.44 --> 3960.039
to stay

3961.64 --> 3966.64
active I like really when you think

3964.359 --> 3969.52
about it it it's not it's technically

3966.64 --> 3972.68
just not too late to do

3969.52 --> 3975.319
that it's just that the corporate and

3972.68 --> 3977.48
power structure don't want that to

3975.319 --> 3980.5589999999997
happen just like the original

3977.48 --> 3984.4
Edison system was used because of the

3980.559 --> 3987.8390000000004
EXP Financial exploitation

3984.4 --> 3990.6800000000003
abilities but but it can still be like

3987.839 --> 3993.119
universally decided at some point like

3990.68 --> 3996.319
yeah we're going to like Drop That

3993.119 --> 3998.599
corporate [Â __Â ] and we are going to just

3996.319 --> 4002.119
create free

3998.599 --> 4003.4
energy by the state and just like erect

4002.119 --> 4006.0
Tesla

4003.4 --> 4008.64
coils that are just going to like have

4006.0 --> 4011.279
energy available up to a certain

4008.64 --> 4015.64
distance and that would probably

4011.279 --> 4017.559
be National lines

4015.64 --> 4021.96
right you don't

4017.559 --> 4027.039
want people beyond your borders just

4021.96 --> 4027.039
like ripping the energy because they

4031.52 --> 4036.319
could if you do that then yeah I mean

4034.76 --> 4038.76
you could even

4036.319 --> 4040.96
like you could still use all the

4038.76 --> 4043.88
electronics how they work now you just

4040.96 --> 4047.039
need like Wireless

4043.88 --> 4049.96
receivers for them to to receive energy

4047.039 --> 4053.76
not Wi-Fi signals but energy I wonder

4049.96 --> 4055.799
though if like Tesla energy energy

4053.76 --> 4060.7200000000003
Fields like that that could be absorbed

4055.799 --> 4063.48
in Power Electronics if that actually

4060.72 --> 4066.4399999999996
disrupts Wireless

4063.48 --> 4069.799
signals or overwrites it that it creates

4066.44 --> 4073.52
like its own Wireless signal that would

4069.799 --> 4077.44
disrupt the sub complicated signals that

4073.52 --> 4077.44
we use for wireless communication

4080.44 --> 4085.2400000000002
it seems logical that it would actually

4082.96 --> 4090.839
unless you specifically

4085.24 --> 4094.7599999999998
design them the wireless signals to not

4090.839 --> 4096.839
be in the way of the Tesla energy

4094.76 --> 4100.0
casting and then you could have them

4096.839 --> 4102.08
simultaneously but you need some

4100.0 --> 4105.88
adaptation because there's a good chance

4102.08 --> 4108.92
that a big Tesla coil is going to be

4105.88 --> 4111.679
like disrupting wireless communication

4108.92 --> 4111.679
with how it now

4112.279 --> 4117.319
works yeah no zapy

4118.759 --> 4123.56
no and you know what happens when you

4121.319 --> 4126.400000000001
suggest those types of things se you

4123.56 --> 4129.120000000001
should know better than

4126.4 --> 4132.799
that you said that you were leaving you

4129.12 --> 4132.799
should have stuck to that doing

4133.199 --> 4139.5199999999995
that yeah giving ballar wrenches is not

4136.64 --> 4139.52
going to fix the

4148.6 --> 4155.159000000001
situation right by the way share the

4150.92 --> 4155.159
show and don't forget to Rogan it

4164.359 --> 4168.359
up for

4204.199 --> 4207.199
h

4244.0 --> 4247.0
there

4255.719 --> 4260.719
no you're not going to get a wrench and

4258.12 --> 4263.64
if I hear you asking for a wrench one

4260.719 --> 4267.44
more time either of you I will ban

4263.64 --> 4267.4400000000005
you do you

4268.76 --> 4274.400000000001
understand there's no

4271.199 --> 4279.639999999999
point now or in the future where you are

4274.4 --> 4279.639999999999
going to get a wrench Especially You O

4314.239 --> 4318.199
for for

4371.42 --> 4376.1990000000005
[Music]

4373.96 --> 4378.4800000000005
all right I guess I'll just have to wait

4376.199 --> 4380.96
I'll just have to wait until somebody

4378.48 --> 4384.48
[Â __Â ] shows up for

4380.96 --> 4387.88
goddamn seriously what the [Â __Â ] is

4384.48 --> 4390.879999999999
this I've got great input where is

4387.88 --> 4390.88
everyone

4434.04 --> 4438.08
I for

4467.48 --> 4472.5199999999995
anybody anybody out there

4492.56 --> 4497.320000000001
anyone it's like what the [Â __Â ] is going

4495.08 --> 4500.0
going on it's like every time I get

4497.32 --> 4502.719
actual good focus and energy and nobody

4500.0 --> 4505.32
shows up what you only come showing up

4502.719 --> 4507.4800000000005
when I'm all flustered and wonky and I

4505.32 --> 4509.12
don't know what the [Â __Â ] to talk about

4507.48 --> 4511.799999999999
is that the moment where you all come

4509.12 --> 4514.32
rolling in and blah blah blah blah blah

4511.8 --> 4517.679
and now I'm actually on point and

4514.32 --> 4520.92
focused and no [Â __Â ] person shows up

4517.679 --> 4520.92
what the [Â __Â ] is

4523.96 --> 4527.96
this for

4563.159 --> 4569.5199999999995
who the [Â __Â ] are even the 2122 watching

4566.52 --> 4573.040000000001
like who are you who's watching why

4569.52 --> 4576.84
aren't you saying anything in my

4573.04 --> 4579.08
chat are you just staring at me oh look

4576.84 --> 4582.76
at that

4579.08 --> 4585.76
guy why don't you say something in the

4582.76 --> 4585.76
chat

4591.96 --> 4596.36
ask a

4593.679 --> 4598.639
question I mean I even let these bards

4596.36 --> 4602.599999999999
in the chat ask questions and I answer

4598.639 --> 4606.32
them and that's it now everybody just

4602.6 --> 4609.159000000001
stays out of here just

4606.32 --> 4611.92
nothing apparently my answers didn't do

4609.159 --> 4614.92
it for you or you just didn't understand

4611.92 --> 4614.92
it

4617.44 --> 4623.839999999999
or you're unwilling to accept it oh

4621.04 --> 4628.0
that's the same as what I said first but

4623.84 --> 4628.0
I mean seriously what the hell is

4643.84 --> 4647.88
this for

4686.12 --> 4690.5599999999995
what what the hell

4710.04 --> 4717.08
what the hell

4713.239 --> 4717.08
really wow fiber

4717.56 --> 4724.92
oats the music you you used is that's

4721.199 --> 4727.44
actually blocked I got this weird video

4724.92 --> 4731.88
copyright detail over

4727.44 --> 4731.879999999999
it what the [Â __Â ]

4736.88 --> 4740.159000000001
I guess I'm going to mute the

4742.159 --> 4747.48
song that's nice that that's an option

4775.08 --> 4783.5199999999995
W you can't even play some damn

4779.84 --> 4783.52
song this is

4786.36 --> 4792.36
just it's just YouTube is just terrible

4801.84 --> 4806.76
but at least it's good that I can edit

4803.96 --> 4810.56
it out of there like but what the [Â __Â ]

4806.76 --> 4810.56
is going on

4812.56 --> 4817.360000000001
guys like what is happening with my

4823.639 --> 4826.639
chat

4853.639 --> 4856.639
for

4883.56 --> 4886.56
for

4913.52 --> 4917.56
for for

4946.12 --> 4951.04
okay well I guess I'm going to just

4947.92 --> 4951.04
round out the show

4954.159 --> 4962.96
then cuz uh yeah this chat

4958.639 --> 4962.96
is it's like it's completely

4966.08 --> 4972.12
disabled yep nobody's there participants

4969.4 --> 4975.0
zero I'm the only

4972.12 --> 4977.8
participant so uh yeah I guess that was

4975.0 --> 4981.159
that I mean I thought it was a very

4977.8 --> 4983.400000000001
interesting show until turns out that

4981.159 --> 4987.159
only balarts like to hang around this

4983.4 --> 4988.36
chat and nobody else shows up at all so

4987.159 --> 4991.719
yeah I'm just going to round out the

4988.36 --> 4994.36
show then very short show very

4991.719 --> 4996.84
unexpected could have been great could

4994.36 --> 4999.48
have gone on for like four hours perhaps

4996.84 --> 5004.4800000000005
with this but yeah if nobody shows up

4999.48 --> 5004.48
then there's no show huh

5011.679 --> 5016.88
I bend everyone no I did not ban

5014.8 --> 5019.2390000000005
everyone there's plenty of people that

5016.88 --> 5021.76
got wrenches that are not banned and

5019.239 --> 5026.5199999999995
nobody showing

5021.76 --> 5028.320000000001
up yeah I don't need ball Tarts to keep

5026.52 --> 5030.679
showing up with their stupid socker

5028.32 --> 5034.12
account that's I don't want them to keep

5030.679 --> 5034.12
showing up

5048.56 --> 5052.639
but maybe I should just talk about Flat

5050.48 --> 5056.4
Earth somewh maybe that's the only thing

5052.639 --> 5059.2390000000005
that just gets these Flat Earth robots

5056.4 --> 5062.159
back in here did you know the Earth is

5059.239 --> 5065.04
flat measured flat calculated flat

5062.159 --> 5066.799999999999
navigated flat

5065.04 --> 5070.04
perceived as

5066.8 --> 5072.8
flat it's flat geometric orientation of

5070.04 --> 5075.679
the Earth surface is

5072.8 --> 5079.639
flat yeah topographically it might not

5075.679 --> 5083.08
be flat but the

5079.639 --> 5086.56
average geometry of the surface is

5083.08 --> 5086.5599999999995
Flat Earth is

5093.32 --> 5097.36
flat for

5141.239 --> 5144.239
yes

5177.719 --> 5184.52
right so I'm going to round out now

5181.8 --> 5186.56
bye yeah you don't show up well and you

5184.52 --> 5190.159000000001
don't get a [Â __Â ]

5186.56 --> 5192.639
show so thanks everyone for coming or

5190.159 --> 5195.0
not showing up and I guaranteeing

5192.639 --> 5197.84
there's a very very short show because

5195.0 --> 5200.159
of that completely

5197.84 --> 5202.76
unnecessarily because I could

5200.159 --> 5205.879999999999
technically keep going for another two

5202.76 --> 5208.119000000001
hours at least with the energy that I

5205.88 --> 5211.159000000001
got but apparently everybody's like oh

5208.119 --> 5213.0
no [Â __Â ] you Arwin [Â __Â ] you [Â __Â ] you and

5211.159 --> 5214.799999999999
your energy [Â __Â ] you and you're wanting

5213.0 --> 5216.96
to communicate with us

5214.8 --> 5222.159000000001
like we're just not going to show up at

5216.96 --> 5222.159
all not say a [Â __Â ] word not a goddamn

5222.6 --> 5225.749000000001
[Music]

5226.44 --> 5230.5199999999995
peep so uh

5232.679 --> 5239.119
yeah now I'm wondering like am I going

5236.239 --> 5240.839999999999
to show up tomorrow maybe I'm just not

5239.119 --> 5242.4
going to show up maybe just not show up

5240.84 --> 5245.4400000000005
not even say anything and just

5242.4 --> 5248.119
everybody's like hey wait isn't there

5245.44 --> 5251.32
supposed to be a flat Earth early bird

5248.119 --> 5255.28
show oh why didn't he show up yeah could

5251.32 --> 5255.28
it be because you didn't show

5256.52 --> 5262.76
up and just leave me out here with

5259.84 --> 5265.0
nobody in the chat nothing no

5262.76 --> 5268.92
communication yeah and there's no excuse

hour straight and no wrench like zero

5600.92 --> 5605.8

5603.88 --> 5607.8
[Â __Â ]

5605.8 --> 5610.08
intolerable I don't know what the hell

in the Skype chat nobody's there like

5612.52 --> 5615.280000000001
what the [Â __Â ]

5624.639 --> 5632.400000000001
man so yeah sorry to end this show in

5628.679 --> 5634.4800000000005
such a complaining grouchy way thought

5632.4 --> 5636.599999999999
it was great th for but I mean there's

5634.48 --> 5638.919999999999
nothing I can do with this like how can

5636.6 --> 5641.76
I recover from this with nobody showing

5638.92 --> 5644.119
up like if now people there was like now

5641.76 --> 5646.0
four people or five people including

5644.119 --> 5647.48
wrenches that suddenly rolled in and

5646.0 --> 5650.679
started like oh hey oh we're here we're

5647.48 --> 5653.799999999999
here then then I'd potentially recover

5650.679 --> 5656.679
from this mood and not round out before

5653.8 --> 5659.360000000001
even two hours have passed yeah but

5656.679 --> 5661.1990000000005
since that's not happening I'm rounding

5659.36 --> 5664.08
out

5661.199 --> 5667.119
now yeah so I'll see you tomorrow with

5664.08 --> 5670.159
flat Earth early bird number

5667.119 --> 5672.32
1963 probably not as inspired probably

5670.159 --> 5674.719
not even a

5672.32 --> 5676.679
title I have to figure it out from

5674.719 --> 5679.639
scratch again and deal with people just

5676.679 --> 5682.04
blabbering about

5679.639 --> 5683.88
nonsense yeah because apparently that's

5682.04 --> 5685.239
what you like in an early bird show

5683.88 --> 5688.4400000000005
that's when you show up when they're

5685.239 --> 5688.44
just blabbering about

5688.639 --> 5694.92
nonsense or when I'm in a not so focused

5691.84 --> 5697.159000000001
mood y all seem to be very entertained

5694.92 --> 5697.159
by

5699.28 --> 5708.239
