good this Sunday and having a nice

229.84 --> 234.599
weekend

231.13 --> 234.599
[Music]

243.959 --> 249.76
yesterday was a kind of an interesting

246.04 --> 254.07899999999998
day another Infowars bonus stream

249.76 --> 254.07899999999998
apparently they're still there but yeah

257.759 --> 263.199
some things had happened basically again

263.759 --> 267.8
and

265.44 --> 270.52
yeah so there's still going to be some

267.8 --> 273.08
Infowars streams in the

270.52 --> 275.56
next few weeks

273.08 --> 278.15999999999997
probably and then we'll see what happens

275.56 --> 278.16
after that

291.68 --> 300.479
point oh break bike broke down you're

295.96 --> 300.479
fixing it all right

307.56 --> 310.479
now I'm doing good

313.96 --> 318.4
too watching a bunch of infow

318.479 --> 323.039
wars that my friend from NE

328.24 --> 331.639
called uh

344.759 --> 351.40000000000003
the debate between Professor Dave and

347.56 --> 351.4
wit itss making its rounds

353.28 --> 358.08
everywhere certainly did get a lot of

355.6 --> 358.08000000000004
attention

358.24 --> 363.0
everywhere I I did not watch it because

360.919 --> 366.039
I mean it's Professor Dave so it's going

363.0 --> 366.039
to be incredibly

368.039 --> 378.639
tedious am I planning to go into name

373.4 --> 378.63899999999995
no no I'm not planning to go the

381.919 --> 390.88
no but uh my friend from might be coming

385.8 --> 393.199
to me somewhere next week or so

390.88 --> 396.199
kind of been had been planning that for

393.199 --> 398.599
a while now like we rarely meet face to

396.199 --> 398.599
face

399.319 --> 403.759
and but yeah

423.0 --> 426.36
yeah I thought a yesterday show was

424.56 --> 428.639
pretty damn

426.36 --> 431.84000000000003
good except

428.639 --> 434.039
perhaps last half hour and even even

431.84 --> 435.67999999999995
though that was still fine it was just

434.039 --> 440.15999999999997
it kind of ruined

435.68 --> 442.599
it Lucy level suddenly going basically

440.16 --> 442.59900000000005
going

443.12 --> 450.039
hostile that was kind of annoying and

447.72 --> 452.0
disappointing but uh yeah I mean the

450.039 --> 455.31899999999996
vast majority of yesterday's show was

452.0 --> 455.319
great very medical

461.12 --> 466.12
focus and I like it like when I'm have a

464.36 --> 469.0
show like that and I'm like really in

466.12 --> 472.28000000000003
the flow of it cuz there is a lot to

469.0 --> 475.879
discuss there and I thought I did

472.28 --> 477.919
great so yeah despite the kind of

475.879 --> 481.879
annoying ending I thought it was a great

477.919 --> 481.87899999999996
show yesterday really well well

486.96 --> 490.84
done it was yeah

498.479 --> 504.52
thanks been keeping up late again I keep

501.639 --> 506.96000000000004
doing it I keep doing it and I

504.52 --> 511.76
shouldn't then again the weather sucks

506.96 --> 513.8389999999999
so it's like yeah it's not much I'm

511.76 --> 516.3199999999999
missing this is kind of weird though

513.839 --> 517.9590000000001
because like in the earliest of morning

516.32 --> 520.7600000000001
there was a bit of

517.959 --> 523.279
sunshine like the early morning and then

520.76 --> 525.56
eventually it just gets clouded and

523.279 --> 527.08
starts raining again

525.56 --> 530.56
and

527.08 --> 533.399
yeah so I did get a bit of sunlight

530.56 --> 536.04
super early in the

533.399 --> 540.56
morning but

536.04 --> 542.519
uh yeah I'm I'm I'm fairly well rested

540.56 --> 546.2399999999999
think like having really good

542.519 --> 546.24
dinner does also

548.68 --> 555.68
help although I will have to go out

551.519 --> 555.68
through this weather to get more

563.64 --> 568.12
dinner all

565.72 --> 570.9200000000001
right anyway I don't know what I'm going

568.12 --> 575.0
to talk about today but

570.92 --> 577.4399999999999
I hope it's going to be just as great as

575.0 --> 580.079
yesterday right anyway I got some coffee

577.44 --> 580.0790000000001
here

581.33 --> 584.359
[Music]

584.8 --> 590.079
cheers and Illuminati cant last one for

588.24 --> 593.64
a

590.079 --> 595.7199999999999
while I mean I'm not it's Sunday so

593.64 --> 597.88
they're probably not going to have them

595.72 --> 601.12
right now at the store so I'm not

597.88 --> 603.64
counting on having Illuminati croissant

601.12 --> 604.9590000000001
tomorrow probably some they will

603.64 --> 609.519
probably still have some regular

604.959 --> 613.8389999999999
croissant so we'll see and yeah my

609.519 --> 613.839
Illuminati croissant support is running

615.32 --> 621.88
low so any support through the PayPal

618.92 --> 624.92
would be great not from you Optimus I

621.88 --> 624.92
know that doesn't work with

625.88 --> 629.88
you right

637.0 --> 643.2
so what shall I talk about today

650.35 --> 653.629
[Music]

672.76 --> 677.8389999999999
you're

674.44 --> 681.32
sure come you sure you're sure I'll come

677.839 --> 685.6
up with something I always do well sort

681.32 --> 686.6
of sometimes it just leads to lots of

685.6 --> 692.2
Silent

686.6 --> 692.2
pauses but I mean I do feel pretty good

706.04 --> 712.519
so I'll be using a wrench on my bike oh

709.519 --> 712.519
okay

719.639 --> 723.44
all right so I'm just going to be

721.44 --> 726.519
looking

723.44 --> 729.85
around some alternative news articles

726.519 --> 733.039
and maybe I'll find some find

729.85 --> 733.039
[Music]

744.24 --> 751.32
something right there was a big news

747.88 --> 756.24
thing on for Wars too and that is

751.32 --> 756.24
that yeah apparently like Saudi Arabia

756.959 --> 765.76
is I think the right word is oh my God

761.959 --> 770.0
what the hell D [ __ ] off I'm not going

765.76 --> 770.0
to bicker about your nonsense

770.92 --> 777.04
again you've made yourself into the the

774.079 --> 777.04
Crazy Town

777.959 --> 781.76
fool right

779.68 --> 783.8
but yeah Saudi Arabia has sort of like

781.76 --> 786.76
defaulted on the Petro

783.8 --> 788.959
dollar and they're not doing that

786.76 --> 793.199
anymore and they're siding with bricks

788.959 --> 796.3199999999999
which is like extremely influential that

793.199 --> 799.76
maneuver and it's like BR shock waves

796.32 --> 802.48
around and it's probably also like why

799.76 --> 805.48
Rothchild the Rothchild has taken up

802.48 --> 808.32
office in Saudi Arabia cuz they're

805.48 --> 810.399
making making a very big maneuver and it

808.32 --> 813.0400000000001
like spells bad news for the Petro

810.399 --> 816.04
dollar which is becoming ever more

813.04 --> 816.04
unstable this

817.04 --> 824.279
way so that was basically what was going

820.48 --> 824.279
on and is going

828.279 --> 834.079
on so yeah United States is going to get

831.519 --> 837.16
into financial trouble like there

834.079 --> 839.92
there's no way to avoid that at this

837.16 --> 842.36
point

839.92 --> 845.16
and if the Deep State all times it all

842.36 --> 848.1990000000001
just perfectly like the maximum

845.16 --> 851.16
consequence will hit exactly when Trump

848.199 --> 853.7589999999999
takes presidency back because it does

851.16 --> 857.759
seem like that's going to

853.759 --> 857.759
happen so they're just going to

860.16 --> 866.16
like drop the [ __ ] truck right on top of

863.519 --> 869.44
his head as soon as he becomes president

866.16 --> 869.4399999999999
pretty much

873.48 --> 878.9590000000001
it's an honest question yeah no it's not

875.8 --> 881.3599999999999
an honest question it's it's a [ __ ]

878.959 --> 884.4399999999999
question you're presupposing the Earth

881.36 --> 888.32
is moving up which is a

884.44 --> 890.24
claim yeah stationary is not a claim

888.32 --> 891.6800000000001
it's nothing that I need to prove

890.24 --> 897.8
because there's no

891.68 --> 901.4399999999999
phenomenon that I would need to prove so

897.8 --> 903.56
D you you're not honest you're you're

901.44 --> 905.8000000000001
the town's

903.56 --> 909.959
fool

905.8 --> 912.639
and I don't think it's like worthwhile

909.959 --> 914.68
entertaining your idiocy

912.639 --> 916.6800000000001
continually every time you feel like

914.68 --> 918.8389999999999
popping by doing the same thing over and

916.68 --> 921.88
over

918.839 --> 924.759
again so

921.88 --> 929.399
uh I mean if you have this compulsive

924.759 --> 931.36
need to express this pres presupposition

929.399 --> 933.399
based Theory you could do that on your

931.36 --> 936.8000000000001
own show I mean you do that on your own

933.399 --> 939.68
show you don't need me to bicker with

936.8 --> 942.3599999999999
you over it pointing out the same things

939.68 --> 946.199
over and over and over again yeah you

942.36 --> 946.1990000000001
don't need to come here and do

947.04 --> 952.04
that just do your own

949.44 --> 955.72
show and and do the same thing over and

952.04 --> 958.4399999999999
over again there all

955.72 --> 961.839
right oh it's another a presupposition

958.44 --> 964.12
is based on real world tests that

961.839 --> 966.2790000000001
presuppose that you're moving upward and

964.12 --> 970.16
that is what you're trying to

966.279 --> 972.399
prove yeah I know and I know you don't

970.16 --> 976.4399999999999
understand

972.399 --> 978.68
because you're kind of barded like that

976.44 --> 980.1600000000001
except ball tarded from a flat earther

978.68 --> 981.7199999999999
perspective yeah just because you're a

980.16 --> 984.24
flat earther doesn't mean you can't be

981.72 --> 987.279
ball tarded about whatever you think the

984.24 --> 989.5600000000001
Earth is and is doing because you

987.279 --> 991.16
obviously are

989.56 --> 995.3599999999999
you are being

991.16 --> 995.36
barded about your flat Earth

996.8 --> 1001.68
idea the presupposition is that you're

999.8 --> 1004.12
doing something and then

1001.68 --> 1007.12
presupposing that whatever is happening

1004.12 --> 1011.24
the way it is is because Earth is moving

1007.12 --> 1011.24
upward that's your presupposition

1020.72 --> 1025.679
pointy doesn't seize in

1023.64 --> 1029.039
freefall

1025.679 --> 1029.039
uh it's

1031.48 --> 1038.439
moving yeah buoyancy density work from a

1036.679 --> 1042.0
stationary

1038.439 --> 1043.439
position if it's moving because of the

1042.0 --> 1046.919
density and

1043.439 --> 1052.919
buoyancy it's moving it's in the middle

1046.919 --> 1052.919
of executing the density and buoyancy

1053.24 --> 1059.24
effect yeah whatever is happening with

1056.919 --> 1061.96
something that is moving well guess what

1059.24 --> 1064.44
density buoyancy no longer applies in

1061.96 --> 1069.0
that exact fashion because it is in the

1064.44 --> 1069.0
middle of doing it you

1069.44 --> 1073.919
dumbass how many times do I need to tell

1072.2 --> 1076.559
you

1073.919 --> 1079.6000000000001
this this specific thing that I have

1076.559 --> 1082.36
started telling you over two years ago

1079.6 --> 1086.52
when you first started rolling out and

1082.36 --> 1086.52
repeating this nonsense over and over

1093.36 --> 1099.6399999999999
again H Richard G by the way and Moxy

1097.24 --> 1099.64
Stone

1099.799 --> 1105.48
monkey

1102.08 --> 1109.4399999999998
yeah talk time don't talk don't tell me

1105.48 --> 1109.44
what to do Moxy

1111.28 --> 1119.32
yeah you're not my Jew manager that gets

1115.6 --> 1122.0
to tell me how how I conduct my my my

1119.32 --> 1122.0
show

1130.919 --> 1136.6000000000001
thanks no you you tried yeah you tried

1134.48 --> 1140.3600000000001
what you tried ramming your stupid

1136.6 --> 1142.799
presupposition forth I rebutted it and

1140.36 --> 1146.0
now you just give up yeah because

1142.799 --> 1146.0
there's nowhere to go

1151.44 --> 1158.159
D investigations I mean that you're just

1155.039 --> 1158.1589999999999
being mean Stone

1161.0 --> 1165.64
monkey I mean this is like some guy

1163.84 --> 1167.6
that's just going around like there's

1165.64 --> 1169.96
portals and there's there's portals

1167.6 --> 1172.9599999999998
everywhere and they

1169.96 --> 1174.64
and they cause portals cause sudden Moon

1172.96 --> 1176.96
swings I'm going to find the Portal and

1174.64 --> 1178.679
you're literally telling him yeah go

1176.96 --> 1181.039
ahead they just look around you're going

1178.679 --> 1182.799
to find those portals like that's what

1181.039 --> 1186.1589999999999
you're doing right now Stone monkey I

1182.799 --> 1189.72
mean you shouldn't encourage this

1186.159 --> 1189.72
Insanity that's been

1190.12 --> 1194.84
rebutted hello Jason mccormac

1202.64 --> 1208.5200000000002
oh yes D of course I mean suddenly not

1206.08 --> 1211.8799999999999
making sense out of anything that's said

1208.52 --> 1214.9189999999999
and just seeing chaos there is a sure

1211.88 --> 1216.96
solution to not catch on that you've

1214.919 --> 1219.1200000000001
been rebutted yeah you could just

1216.96 --> 1222.32
suddenly think of it as gibberish what

1219.12 --> 1225.0
I've said that way you can avoid

1222.32 --> 1227.6399999999999
understanding how you're wrong yeah it's

1225.0 --> 1230.28
a a great barded

1227.64 --> 1233.0800000000002
trait it's a great way to be able to

1230.28 --> 1235.19
move on without catching on so you you

1233.08 --> 1236.36
do

1235.19 --> 1240.039
[Music]

1236.36 --> 1242.9599999999998
that and keep lulling

1240.039 --> 1245.36
yeah yeah it's not familiar to me at all

1242.96 --> 1249.2
it's not like every [ __ ] baller does

1245.36 --> 1252.4799999999998
that every time I rebut their barded

1249.2 --> 1254.559
arguments yeah they do exactly that yeah

1252.48 --> 1257.559
you're no different than a Ballard

1254.559 --> 1257.559
congratulations

1266.08 --> 1270.799
no I'm not have D on the night all shut

1268.28 --> 1270.799
the hell up

1275.799 --> 1281.44
Moxy rip butting flat oh

1284.679 --> 1293.3600000000001
okay well you have fun with that Richard

1289.64 --> 1295.2
I I prefer not to waste my time with the

1293.36 --> 1297.76
same nonsense over and over again that's

1295.2 --> 1301.0
been addressed and rebutted but hey if

1297.76 --> 1303.279
you like that and you like that person

1301.0 --> 1305.88
not responding to the rebuttal and then

1303.279 --> 1308.799
engaging somebody else that's not

1305.88 --> 1311.96
entirely capable of actually properly

1308.799 --> 1314.84
rebutting it so that you can keep

1311.96 --> 1317.24
wrestling in the mud you find that

1314.84 --> 1320.52
entertaining then yeah by all means be

1317.24 --> 1320.52
entertained by that

1328.76 --> 1334.72
yes I will just be sitting here talking

1330.799 --> 1337.12
nonsense over and over again yes that's

1334.72 --> 1340.2
what I

1337.12 --> 1342.3999999999999
do I mean my show yesterday that's just

1340.2 --> 1344.919
nonsense talking over and over again

1342.4 --> 1347.279
about medical experimentation it's not

1344.919 --> 1349.2
super relevant or anything it's not

1347.279 --> 1352.52
actually addressing a

1349.2 --> 1355.6000000000001
cognitively broken Society that's been

1352.52 --> 1358.279
resting on a system that's basically not

1355.6 --> 1361.12
what it claims to

1358.279 --> 1363.279
be that's just repeating nonsense over

1361.12 --> 1365.6399999999999
and over again I mean that's what I do

1363.279 --> 1369.64
right it's not like I literally talk

1365.64 --> 1372.7990000000002
about the same subject over and over

1369.64 --> 1377.039
again every time I come on the internet

1372.799 --> 1379.48
that's been rebutted in detail like you

1377.039 --> 1382.4
right d

1379.48 --> 1385.6
so yeah you can think of everything

1382.4 --> 1385.6000000000001
whatever the hell you want

1387.36 --> 1393.9599999999998
man I don't comprehend actual physics

1390.6 --> 1393.9599999999998
yes yes of course I

1400.67 --> 1403.759
[Music]

1404.559 --> 1410.44
don't this topic wasn't covered yeah it

1407.76 --> 1410.44
was

1410.76 --> 1416.6
yeah it was covered at at fed two years

1417.64 --> 1423.039
ago guess who did that me I covered

1423.12 --> 1431.36
it and then they moved on they decided

1428.0 --> 1433.679
like yeah well you know what unlike Dell

1431.36 --> 1436.6399999999999
let's not make this the subject that we

1433.679 --> 1438.76
talk over and over and over and over and

1436.64 --> 1441.88
over again

1438.76 --> 1443.96
let's just treat it work it out and then

1441.88 --> 1445.7990000000002
round it out and that's what they did

1443.96 --> 1450.52
two years

1445.799 --> 1450.52
ago look who didn't move

1456.44 --> 1463.88
on Happy Father's Day oh yeah yeah

1460.12 --> 1463.8799999999999
congratulations everybody who's a

1464.24 --> 1470.0
dad which of course does not include me

1492.799 --> 1498.48
did I send Dad a card I don't send cards

1510.84 --> 1515.279
how does stationary have a

1520.76 --> 1529.8799999999999
vector well stationary is a state a

1525.32 --> 1529.8799999999999
state doesn't have a vector

1531.08 --> 1538.399
like stationary is just

1534.44 --> 1540.96
stationary any Vector do like passive

1538.399 --> 1543.32
replacement based Vector well it's just

1540.96 --> 1546.3600000000001
set the way it

1543.32 --> 1549.559
is it's called relative density it just

1546.36 --> 1552.4399999999998
has this Vector this vertical Vector up

1549.559 --> 1554.399
for the less dense down for the the more

1552.44 --> 1556.48
dense and that's just the way it is

1554.399 --> 1559.6789999999999
that's how it turned out to

1556.48 --> 1562.919
be when you test

1559.679 --> 1565.3600000000001
density and passive displacement due to

1562.919 --> 1567.6000000000001
relative density dise equilibrium that's

1565.36 --> 1571.84
what it turns out to

1567.6 --> 1574.399
be yeah it's the vertical Vector passive

1571.84 --> 1576.84
displacement up for the less dens down

1574.399 --> 1580.08
for the more dense and that's the way it

1576.84 --> 1584.84
is it's not due to anything it's

1580.08 --> 1588.399
not necessary to even claim a cause for

1584.84 --> 1591.9189999999999
any of it it's just established and

1588.399 --> 1594.2399999999998
measured and repeated to be that way and

1591.919 --> 1598.44
the reason why is completely

1594.24 --> 1599.64
irrelevant because density merely cares

1598.44 --> 1603.64
density

1599.64 --> 1604.919
Theory merely points out how things move

1603.64 --> 1608.039
and

1604.919 --> 1611.279
why they move up because they're less

1608.039 --> 1614.039
dense than the than the medium they're

1611.279 --> 1616.48
in they move down because they're more

1614.039 --> 1619.76
dense than the medium they're in and

1616.48 --> 1619.76
that's it

1620.559 --> 1625.2
that's that's the scientific inquiry

1623.08 --> 1629.48
that that's what it

1625.2 --> 1629.48
does no more information

1635.039 --> 1643.76
required relative density seizes

1639.0 --> 1646.679
when connected to Earth not you mean no

1643.76 --> 1649.64
no it does count it always counts it's

1646.679 --> 1653.64
just that if something is in

1649.64 --> 1656.76
motion well then it's literally in the

1653.64 --> 1659.72
middle of being affected by relative

1656.76 --> 1662.44
density dis equilibrium when something

1659.72 --> 1664.64
is affected by a force it's going to

1662.44 --> 1668.64
rearrange some

1664.64 --> 1670.64
things yeah something is moving down

1668.64 --> 1672.5590000000002
because of relative density

1670.64 --> 1676.279
disequilibrium because it's more dense

1672.559 --> 1679.039
than the medium it is in well whatever

1676.279 --> 1682.679
is flexibly

1679.039 --> 1685.44
present within the object it's going to

1682.679 --> 1688.159
rearrange

1685.44 --> 1692.0
itself yeah because it's in the middle

1688.159 --> 1695.44
of being displaced because it's the

1692.0 --> 1697.72
object as a whole is at this equilibrium

1695.44 --> 1699.919
with the medium it is in now whatever

1697.72 --> 1703.08
happens within the

1699.919 --> 1706.6000000000001
object is a side

1703.08 --> 1709.32
note cuz it's going to rearrange itself

1706.6 --> 1712.8799999999999
in opposition to any forces it's being

1709.32 --> 1715.36
subjected to so if it's Free Falling or

1712.88 --> 1716.919
usually it has to be slightly faster

1715.36 --> 1718.519
than Free Falling because there's

1716.919 --> 1719.96
friction that's going to hold back the

1718.519 --> 1724.1200000000001
true Free

1719.96 --> 1726.799
Fall well then whatever is in the object

1724.12 --> 1731.4799999999998
if it's able to move freely it's going

1726.799 --> 1734.48
to seem like it's in neutral

1731.48 --> 1737.559
suspension because the entire thing is

1734.48 --> 1738.76
moving downward and so relative density

1737.559 --> 1741.36
to the

1738.76 --> 1742.919
subm medium right because relative

1741.36 --> 1746.08
density

1742.919 --> 1748.88
Works anchored from a stationary

1746.08 --> 1750.519
perspective like it's still nothing is

1748.88 --> 1754.1200000000001
moving well that's where relative

1750.519 --> 1757.0
density works if an object is moving is

1754.12 --> 1759.1589999999999
engaging in being subjected to relative

1757.0 --> 1761.76
density disequilibrium well then

1759.159 --> 1764.2
whatever happens in that object as it is

1761.76 --> 1768.76
being subjected to relative density

1764.2 --> 1771.32
equilibrium is different from a state

1768.76 --> 1774.48
situation because it's being subjected

1771.32 --> 1777.0
to forces the force of relative density

1774.48 --> 1781.799
dis equilibrium tried to explain this

1777.0 --> 1784.08
only like 20 times in the last two years

1781.799 --> 1784.08
and I

1784.6 --> 1788.8799999999999
mean don't know what else to tell

1790.0 --> 1796.519
you still not explaining

1792.76 --> 1800.039
it okay Moxy you

1796.519 --> 1800.039
can [ __ ]

1801.679 --> 1806.44
off yes this this not even your damn

1804.159 --> 1809.3600000000001
argument you Ballard [ __ ] with you think

1806.44 --> 1812.679
you could just like create feuds among

1809.36 --> 1816.559
flat earthers for the fun of it [ __ ] you

1812.679 --> 1816.5590000000002
Moxy you don't believe in

1818.88 --> 1824.0390000000002
anything no Richard G I'm not going to

1821.399 --> 1826.32
invite Dell on a night all show I'm not

1824.039 --> 1829.32
going to waste my time with this hor

1826.32 --> 1829.32
[ __ ]

1834.279 --> 1839.2
I've addressed everything I've been

1836.44 --> 1842.24
perfectly consistent in my addressal of

1839.2 --> 1845.8400000000001
it as I have been in the past you can

1842.24 --> 1848.679
literally compare every single

1845.84 --> 1851.6
time there's been a recording of a

1848.679 --> 1855.72
conversation where I explain this and my

1851.6 --> 1858.6789999999999
explanations have been 100%

1855.72 --> 1861.159
consistent and correct

1858.679 --> 1861.159
from the

1866.08 --> 1872.32
start yes I'm being exposed I'm so

1869.76 --> 1874.6
exposed on my live show where I have

1872.32 --> 1876.639
complete control and I'm being super

1874.6 --> 1879.4399999999998
consistent in my rebuttal to a

1876.639 --> 1881.1589999999999
ridiculous claim of a flat earther that

1879.44 --> 1885.24
presupposes that the Earth is moving

1881.159 --> 1886.48
upward which causes the axis of the

1885.24 --> 1889.0
density

1886.48 --> 1892.08
distribution yeah

1889.0 --> 1895.12
I'm being exposed everybody I'm so

1892.08 --> 1897.8799999999999
exposed I feel so

1895.12 --> 1900.8799999999999
exposed

1897.88 --> 1903.6000000000001
no oh you can't manipulate me with your

1900.88 --> 1903.6000000000001
dumb horse

1908.72 --> 1914.88
[ __ ] all right I'm gonna take a bite out

1911.08 --> 1914.8799999999999
of this one cheers

1919.76 --> 1926.279
the force is demonstratively upward yeah

1923.12 --> 1926.279
if you presuppose

1932.12 --> 1936.32
that you know

1962.159 --> 1967.279
hello Lucas Williams whoever you are

1972.18 --> 1975.289
[Music]

1988.12 --> 1993.039
okay so is anybody else going to come in

1990.399 --> 1997.399
here because I'm not just going to

1993.039 --> 1999.08
let Dell just steamroll his horse [ __ ]

1997.399 --> 2002.4799999999998
all over my

1999.08 --> 2004.8799999999999
chat yeah I don't want Today Show to

2002.48 --> 2007.3990000000001
just be bickering with this [ __ ]

2004.88 --> 2012.44
[ __ ] who keeps reiterating his same

2007.399 --> 2012.4399999999998
stupid fallacious idea over and over

2013.32 --> 2020.399
again I don't like discussing things

2016.679 --> 2023.0800000000002
with people that don't listen to any

2020.399 --> 2027.7199999999998
rebuttal that can't even address

2023.08 --> 2027.72
anything I'm sick of it

2030.71 --> 2033.789
[Music]

2061.56 --> 2065.56
right I'll just keep eating this

2066.72 --> 2069.72
cheers

2078.5 --> 2081.63
[Music]

2096.64 --> 2100.68
for for

2161.599 --> 2167.28
I

2163.16 --> 2169.52
mean if anybody else wants to address

2167.28 --> 2172.3590000000004
the same hor [ __ ] that Dell keeps

2169.52 --> 2176.96
rolling out over and over again by all

2172.359 --> 2176.96
means you take over cuz I'm

2177.4 --> 2186.2400000000002
just I'm just tired of repeating

2181.839 --> 2189.56
myself I'm knowing that that there's not

2186.24 --> 2189.56
that he's not listening

2216.52 --> 2220.56
h for

2262.16 --> 2265.16
m

2303.24 --> 2308.4399999999996
okay did they just like get a stroke and

2305.52 --> 2310.88
die or something or is he like preparing

2308.44 --> 2310.88
his own

2311.56 --> 2318.04
hangout cuz he's not repeating his

2314.28 --> 2318.0400000000004
nonsense anymore in my chat

2320.8 --> 2324.2400000000002
now which is

2324.839 --> 2329.16
fine there no real point in it

2334.68 --> 2340.0789999999997
anyway damn it I went through that

2337.04 --> 2340.079
coffee way too

2356.04 --> 2362.319
quick all right anybody out

2358.76 --> 2366.6800000000003
there still don't forget the Rogan up

2362.319 --> 2366.68
the show and share it

2367.52 --> 2371.2
what the hell

2410.68 --> 2414.64
a Richie G glad to see you're still with

2417.68 --> 2423.319
us all right and hey guys I'm not trying

2420.599 --> 2427.4
to be mean to Dell it's just that his

2423.319 --> 2427.4
overall behavior is

2428.4 --> 2433.52
bullish bullheaded there's just no

2442.319 --> 2446.319
point and for those that have witnessed

2445.04 --> 2448.68
this kind of thing happening it's not

2446.319 --> 2450.92
the first time Dell just Wales in and

2448.68 --> 2454.04
just does this sort of thing in my show

2450.92 --> 2456.96
in my chat it's always the same thing

2454.04 --> 2459.839
and some of you may have like witnessed

2456.96 --> 2461.96
that a couple of times now and then you

2459.839 --> 2466.119
know like there's really nothing I can

2461.96 --> 2466.119
do you know

2517.079 --> 2522.4
all right so yeah if you wish

2520.319 --> 2525.2
to

2522.4 --> 2528.52
demonstrate a scientific

2525.2 --> 2530.1189999999997
claim that the realm is uh moving upward

2528.52 --> 2533.8
in order to cause

2530.119 --> 2535.119
the axis of the vertical displacement

2533.8 --> 2536.8390000000004
caused by relative density

2535.119 --> 2539.52
disequilibrium well then you're going to

2536.839 --> 2541.88
have to very manipulate that upward

2539.52 --> 2543.599
Motion in order to demonstrate whether

2541.88 --> 2548.48
that happens or

2543.599 --> 2550.319
not because just presupposing it

2548.48 --> 2553.48
and

2550.319 --> 2554.96
then having things move around yeah it

2553.48 --> 2556.8
doesn't demonstrate it because you're

2554.96 --> 2560.16
not varying and

2556.8 --> 2563.559
manipulated you're not varying and

2560.16 --> 2567.2799999999997
manipulating the cause of what you

2563.559 --> 2567.28
assume to be the

2568.119 --> 2573.8
effect you're not varying the

2571.28 --> 2577.6400000000003
presupposed upward Motion in order to

2573.8 --> 2577.6400000000003
demonstrate anything

2578.16 --> 2584.48
you're just assuming that that is

2581.04 --> 2587.079
happening and that whatever you do

2584.48 --> 2588.839
responds to that thing you're

2587.079 --> 2591.04
presupposing you're not very

2588.839 --> 2594.0
manipulating the

2591.04 --> 2595.64
situation that you claim in order to

2594.0 --> 2598.88
prove that it's

2595.64 --> 2602.319
there and you

2598.88 --> 2605.079
couldn't I mean I take it you kind of

2602.319 --> 2608.2
know that you as an experiment can't

2605.079 --> 2611.4
very manipulate the the claim to be

2608.2 --> 2615.839
upward motion of Earth now can

2611.4 --> 2618.839
you it's all a dead end it's all

2615.839 --> 2618.839
presupposed

2630.76 --> 2634.7200000000003
nonsense damn it I one more

2635.2 --> 2639.04
coffee I'll just wait for

2644.32 --> 2655.1600000000003
[Music]

2647.48 --> 2655.16
bit oh yeah sure yeah yeah yeah no

2679.0 --> 2682.0
h

2693.46 --> 2698.38
[Music]

2702.839 --> 2706.5589999999997
you don't have to prove a

2706.76 --> 2709.76
negative

2714.599 --> 2720.3590000000004
what what do you mean

2717.96 --> 2724.52
negative now stationary is not a

2720.359 --> 2727.5989999999997
negative it's literally another word for

2724.52 --> 2730.16
nothing nothing happening

2727.599 --> 2730.1600000000003
it's not a

2751.4 --> 2755.2000000000003
negative something isn't doing something

2754.28 --> 2758.48
yeah

2755.2 --> 2761.319
but that's literally denial of a claim

2758.48 --> 2763.88
that I'm not making somebody's making

2761.319 --> 2765.839
that something is doing something

2763.88 --> 2767.599
they're going to have to actually prove

2765.839 --> 2771.0789999999997
it by very

2767.599 --> 2774.6400000000003
manipulating the cause of the

2771.079 --> 2777.6800000000003
effect through demonstration which they

2774.64 --> 2780.04
can't I don't have to very manipulate

2777.68 --> 2782.5589999999997
anything in order to demonstrate that

2780.04 --> 2782.5589999999997
nothing is

2783.91 --> 2789.8799999999997
[Music]

2785.92 --> 2789.88
happening for

2803.37 --> 2806.739
[Music]

2845.24 --> 2848.839
okay let's get this out of the way

2848.88 --> 2851.119
all

2857.48 --> 2862.559
right right I mean Richard you just

2860.04 --> 2862.5589999999997
think about

2862.68 --> 2868.7599999999998
it if the claim is nothing is happening

2865.76 --> 2872.0400000000004
how am I going to how and what am I

2868.76 --> 2876.2000000000003
going to very manipulate in order to

2872.04 --> 2876.2
prove that nothing is happening

2883.92 --> 2889.5
yeah I

2885.88 --> 2892.599
mean this is basic logic

2889.5 --> 2892.599
[Music]

2929.68 --> 2933.9199999999996
the only way to verify any of this

2931.92 --> 2935.359
really is to be outside of the realm of

2933.92 --> 2938.48
you yeah that's

2935.359 --> 2941.119
right I know that's what I said two

2938.48 --> 2943.4
years ago yeah you have to actually

2941.119 --> 2946.359
detach yourself from the presupposed

2943.4 --> 2948.48
reference frame of the upwards moving

2946.359 --> 2953.4
Earth in order to establish that it is

2948.48 --> 2955.44
actually moving upward you can't do that

2953.4 --> 2957.2000000000003
logically because if you could then

2955.44 --> 2960.04
there wouldn't be any containment and

2957.2 --> 2964.799
there would be a realm outside of the

2960.04 --> 2968.079
realm of void in which somehow the realm

2964.799 --> 2970.48
is moving upwards in some ways

2968.079 --> 2972.3590000000004
magically it's all

2970.48 --> 2975.359
nonsense it's

2972.359 --> 2975.359
just

2976.16 --> 2980.96
hypothetical and undemonstrated

3026.68 --> 3029.68
e

3057.96 --> 3060.96
h

3115.799 --> 3122.92
oh cool more studies came in

3119.68 --> 3126.16
apparently vegan meat replacement

3122.92 --> 3128.96
products significantly increase the

3126.16 --> 3130.8799999999997
chances of cancer and heart

3128.96 --> 3134.799
disease or

3130.88 --> 3140.1600000000003
something but I mean yeah no surprise

3134.799 --> 3140.16
there it's not going to be good for you

3172.44 --> 3178.48
in other news troll [ __ ] retards

3176.839 --> 3180.88
think that

3178.48 --> 3185.92
they're doing

3180.88 --> 3191.079
something to me by sending money to

3185.92 --> 3194.839
Ukraine in my name like oh no oh wow you

3191.079 --> 3197.76
throw away money to some idiot scam

3194.839 --> 3201.0789999999997
artist for a pointless war and you think

3197.76 --> 3204.3190000000004
that that matters to me dude you can

3201.079 --> 3206.88
literally just stack your money up in a

3204.319 --> 3208.88
house and light it on fire and just burn

3206.88 --> 3212.359
yourself as far as I'm concerned like I

3208.88 --> 3212.359
don't give a [ __ ] what you

3214.359 --> 3217.799
do think that

3223.68 --> 3226.75
[Music]

3235.44 --> 3239.4
matters for

3290.2 --> 3296.48
right so yeah I guess that the besides

3293.68 --> 3298.2799999999997
the drop in of Dell here creating a ro

3296.48 --> 3299.64
CU there's not a lot of things happening

3298.28 --> 3304.2000000000003
in my

3299.64 --> 3307.64
show Richard G is also kind of done it

3304.2 --> 3310.359
seems with his attempt to tackle the

3307.64 --> 3313.8799999999997
situation and well he did actually come

3310.359 --> 3317.359
to the conclusion that where I rest and

3313.88 --> 3317.359
that's like yeah there's no

3318.359 --> 3323.839
point it's chasing a

3321.52 --> 3326.96
rainbow that was effectively like

3323.839 --> 3329.7599999999998
chasing a rainbow or an elusive dragon

3326.96 --> 3334.0
that they can never reach and like yeah

3329.76 --> 3336.7990000000004
yeah that's what I said two years ago

3334.0 --> 3341.28
literally and now two years later I

3336.799 --> 3341.28
still have to reiterate

3342.4 --> 3348.48
that makes Dell kind of ridiculous

3345.16 --> 3348.48
doesn't it

3375.079 --> 3378.079
one

3391.48 --> 3395.559
okay all right I think I will make

3393.64 --> 3399.5989999999997
another coffee or something and we'll

3395.559 --> 3399.599
see what happens be right

3415.24 --> 3418.24
back

3445.16 --> 3448.16
e

3475.119 --> 3478.119
for

3505.119 --> 3508.119
for

3535.039 --> 3538.039
e

3565.039 --> 3568.039
e

3595.039 --> 3599.0

3640.92 --> 3644.2000000000003
short [ __ ] show

3648.88 --> 3655.44
then yeah 1 hour in I think I'm probably

3653.68 --> 3657.9199999999996
going to round out somewhere in the next

3655.44 --> 3657.92
5 minutes

3659.96 --> 3666.2400000000002
cuz if the total amount of people

3662.68 --> 3670.5989999999997
commenting is two and then they stop

3666.24 --> 3672.4799999999996
showing up after an hour well yeah well

3670.599 --> 3675.28
then screw

3672.48 --> 3678.28
you I'll just have a super short show

3675.28 --> 3678.28
