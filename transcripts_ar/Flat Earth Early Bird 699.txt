132.8 --> 135.04000000000002
it's

135.76 --> 140.239
wow look at how fast those clouds are

137.84 --> 140.239
moving

140.56 --> 144.959
i see i'm holding still relatively you

142.8 --> 149.20000000000002
can literally see it moving

144.959 --> 152.48
compared to it see

149.2 --> 155.44
it's going that fast and

152.48 --> 156.0
yeah so if spots are blue then it's

155.44 --> 157.76
completely

156.0 --> 159.2
cloud covered again there doesn't seem

157.76 --> 161.28
to be any rain but there's a lot of

159.2 --> 164.48
moist in the air

161.28 --> 164.48
i don't know if you can see that

165.76 --> 174.48
but not cold not really that cold at all

170.64 --> 176.23899999999998

174.48 --> 178.48
i don't know what this weather is i

176.239 --> 181.59900000000002

178.48 --> 183.2
what kind of weather this is but it's

181.599 --> 185.83999999999997

flatter debates

333.28 --> 338.88
after show was very long again like

338.88 --> 342.71999999999997
hours

340.16 --> 344.24
and even after that we kept hanging

342.72 --> 347.91900000000004
around

344.24 --> 347.919
like chocolate and brian

373.52 --> 380.0
where some in yeah a lot of intro data

377.759 --> 383.6

very curious they gave a lot of intra

406.8 --> 409.84000000000003
data very detailed

410.56 --> 414.639
and yeah very curious what's going to

412.319 --> 414.639
happen

420.84 --> 425.75899999999996
right

423.759 --> 428.0
yeah that was pretty much it i just

425.759 --> 430.72
watched uh

428.0 --> 430.72
videos

431.36 --> 437.09000000000003
nothing really that stood out

434.72 --> 440.16
wait let me check

437.09 --> 440.15999999999997
[Music]

445.43 --> 448.61
[Music]

448.96 --> 453.039
right yeah they're pretty much there was

451.919 --> 455.44
a quantum

453.039 --> 456.88
eraser premiere but i didn't really

455.44 --> 459.44
catch that

456.88 --> 462.4
plenty of letters debate premieres

459.44 --> 465.599
caught most of them

462.4 --> 468.15999999999997
the own benjamin show

465.599 --> 470.56
uh other than that no not really

468.16 --> 470.56
anything

476.84 --> 481.28
noteworthy

479.039 --> 481.28
right

490.96 --> 507.84
a hannah koala

514.15 --> 518.8389999999999
[Music]

516.479 --> 521.839
hold on guys i'll be right back two

518.839 --> 521.839
minutes

639.279 --> 641.6
right

644.24 --> 647.839
yeah sorry about that

656.079 --> 661.8389999999999
right well yeah

666.959 --> 670.399
no not invisible cloak

672.839 --> 677.0400000000001
sheesh

674.72 --> 677.9200000000001
yeah as i said i was feeling a little

677.04 --> 679.8389999999999
bit like

677.92 --> 681.1999999999999
wheezy and weird and i could have

679.839 --> 685.519
probably held out but

681.2 --> 688.399
now i feel better so this is

685.519 --> 689.839
yeah that was uh the retrospect a good

688.399 --> 692.64
choice to make

689.839 --> 692.6400000000001
let's move on

700.0 --> 703.44
because being nauseated it kind of

701.92 --> 706.399
distracts me

703.44 --> 706.399
so yeah

714.839 --> 720.399
goody right so

717.12 --> 722.72
yeah any subjects guys want to talk

720.399 --> 722.72
about

728.88 --> 732.639
like in on the flat earth debates

730.639 --> 735.2
yesterday i really kind of ended up in a

732.639 --> 738.32
weird position i felt

735.2 --> 740.0790000000001
where yeah the uh some of the other

738.32 --> 743.2
people in the

740.079 --> 745.4399999999999
panel yeah they were going after bob

743.2 --> 748.32
from blow busters for well for his

745.44 --> 752.32
flawed assertions

748.32 --> 753.9200000000001
and i was the one actually telling them

752.32 --> 757.6
like come on

753.92 --> 761.5999999999999
just let it go just don't let it bother

757.6 --> 761.6
you as i said

762.8 --> 768.399
but yeah it kept on going i don't know

769.92 --> 773.1999999999999
i do understand though because i was

771.92 --> 776.0
like that myself

773.2 --> 778.639
first but now i don't know that's kind

776.0 --> 778.639
of changed

782.88 --> 786.56
earth is hanging in nothing according to

785.279 --> 791.6
god

786.56 --> 791.5999999999999
or i

795.519 --> 801.839
hanging in nothing how does that work

798.56 --> 801.8389999999999
where is it hanging from

809.839 --> 816.8800000000001
but yeah hey who knows you know

814.56 --> 819.5999999999999
hanging in nothing if the realm is a

816.88 --> 822.639
self-contained looping system

819.6 --> 825.519
then outside of the

822.639 --> 827.6
space in which physical things can exist

825.519 --> 829.76
there will not exist anything that could

827.6 --> 833.0400000000001
be considered a void

829.76 --> 835.4399999999999
now you could say

833.04 --> 836.24
that it's hanging in there but yeah

835.44 --> 839.839
there is no

836.24 --> 843.519
relation to anything else so it's just

839.839 --> 847.2790000000001
there that's it

843.519 --> 847.279
doesn't really mean it's a ball

847.519 --> 852.72
that is hanging in space and we're

849.199 --> 852.7199999999999
standing on the surface of that ball

854.839 --> 857.839
so

873.519 --> 878.48
right marco box yeah that's very cute

879.279 --> 889.76
all these astronomical sized lengths

884.32 --> 889.7600000000001
sizes distances and ages

890.32 --> 895.0400000000001
that's all very cute but there's no

892.079 --> 895.04
proof of any of it

896.839 --> 899.839
hmm

910.839 --> 927.839
um

912.079 --> 927.8389999999999
all right

929.44 --> 935.1990000000001
okay i don't remember that earth

932.639 --> 935.199
passenger

938.72 --> 947.1990000000001
oh hello uh

941.88 --> 947.199
aramistan stone eramistan

950.16 --> 953.199
yeah thanks for the compliment

952.399 --> 955.44
appreciate that

953.199 --> 958.88
i do my best i i have up and ups and

955.44 --> 958.8800000000001
downs and today i'm like

959.36 --> 962.5600000000001
i don't know what it is man

963.68 --> 967.68
it's weird because technically i guess i

965.44 --> 969.9200000000001
didn't have that much sleep

967.68 --> 971.12
they did i just got up really early and

969.92 --> 973.199
it wasn't like

971.12 --> 976.079
i had like this feeling like i was being

973.199 --> 976.079
pushed to get up

976.48 --> 980.839
but then after i got lunch now i'm

978.399 --> 982.24
feeling like oh i need time to recover

980.839 --> 984.639
it's

982.24 --> 984.639
whatever

988.88 --> 994.0
yeah by the way my jaw like the swelling

992.32 --> 996.9590000000001
is

994.0 --> 999.519
it it's not as prominent anymore so

996.959 --> 1002.2399999999999
maybe it's that

999.519 --> 1004.48
you know usually in the healing phases

1002.24 --> 1007.839
of issues with my body

1004.48 --> 1010.639
inflammations all that event yeah

1007.839 --> 1011.759
the last stage is are accompanied by

1010.639 --> 1013.199
nausea which is

1011.759 --> 1014.88
explainable because yeah there's

1013.199 --> 1017.5999999999999
suddenly a lot more

1014.88 --> 1018.8
junk going through my blood because

1017.6 --> 1020.5600000000001
that's where it goes

1018.8 --> 1022.0
and then it gets processed by the

1020.56 --> 1024.079
kidneys and the liver and all that

1022.0 --> 1027.919
mostly kidneys

1024.079 --> 1030.72
but yeah that does have like a

1027.919 --> 1032.72
short-term sort of chemical polluting

1030.72 --> 1034.319
influence so it feels like that and it

1032.72 --> 1038.0
does feel like that it feels

1034.319 --> 1042.319
yeah but i trust

1038.0 --> 1046.079
that that will eventually go away

1042.319 --> 1048.72
i estimate maybe two or three days

1046.079 --> 1049.28
that it'll be like new and it'll feel

1048.72 --> 1053.44
like

1049.28 --> 1058.48
there was never any issue there

1053.44 --> 1058.48
that's my current estimation but yeah

1058.96 --> 1062.64
i think by the time that the flat earth

1060.48 --> 1066.08
debates start i will probably be a

1062.64 --> 1069.2
little bit more active

1066.08 --> 1071.6
maybe you guys can keep get me going on

1069.2 --> 1071.6000000000001
something

1073.36 --> 1076.799
because that usually works

1076.88 --> 1080.5590000000002
chad has managed this yeah the last few

1079.28 --> 1082.72
months to always

1080.559 --> 1086.0
be able to insert something that gets me

1082.72 --> 1086.0
going on some rant

1086.559 --> 1095.84
or an explanation tour of a subject

1101.6 --> 1108.9599999999998
is a whole video of on board rockets

1105.44 --> 1112.72
on ward rockets uh

1108.96 --> 1115.2
no but it is

1112.72 --> 1115.2
tricked

1117.52 --> 1121.12
because i'm pretty sure that as part of

1119.919 --> 1123.679
setups they do

1121.12 --> 1126.4799999999998
send things up i don't think that the

1123.679 --> 1128.16
astronauts are really in them

1126.48 --> 1130.16
because it just doesn't balance out the

1128.16 --> 1131.039
way they've done it they've made it

1130.16 --> 1134.72
cheap using

1131.039 --> 1137.12
helium balloons and rocket combined

1134.72 --> 1138.48
so they do send up cameras at least to

1137.12 --> 1140.4799999999998
give the shots

1138.48 --> 1143.2
but then eventually they tend to

1140.48 --> 1143.2
transition

1143.52 --> 1149.76
into something else if they want to also

1146.88 --> 1150.3200000000002
show the thing just staying in orbit or

1149.76 --> 1153.52
doing

1150.32 --> 1154.6399999999999
interfacing with some other station or

1153.52 --> 1158.32
whatever

1154.64 --> 1161.2800000000002
and that's usually pure trickery

1158.32 --> 1162.3999999999999
from that point but when they send the

1161.28 --> 1165.44
thing up yeah they do

1162.4 --> 1169.039
stick cameras on it and it is showing

1165.44 --> 1172.48
what it is showing but they do typically

1169.039 --> 1173.2
aim for certain types of shots where the

1172.48 --> 1175.6
natural

1173.2 --> 1178.48
fish eye lens of the camera will show

1175.6 --> 1180.48
the earth as a globe and then when it

1178.48 --> 1182.0
reaches an angle where it doesn't really

1180.48 --> 1183.52
do that anymore that's when they cut

1182.0 --> 1186.559
away

1183.52 --> 1189.84
and usually turn to cgi

1186.559 --> 1194.559
because then they assume they are

1189.84 --> 1194.559
in orbit at that point sort of

1195.44 --> 1202.24
but yeah not all of it

1199.12 --> 1204.3999999999999
is just like yeah

1202.24 --> 1207.84
from the get-go cgi i do think that they

1204.4 --> 1210.799
do send cameras up with these

1207.84 --> 1213.28
yeah these helium balloon based rocket

1210.799 --> 1213.28
launches

1214.88 --> 1221.8400000000001
and then use that in the entire

1218.84 --> 1221.84
production

1230.48 --> 1236.88
oh look at that standard of denial

1234.0 --> 1236.88
denial of what

1237.44 --> 1240.96
are you saying i'm denying

1241.12 --> 1248.559
that there is a non-stop uninterrupted

1244.64 --> 1252.96
uncut video footage stream

1248.559 --> 1256.24
of a rocket launch from

1252.96 --> 1258.88
ground zero up to

1256.24 --> 1262.24
high earth orbit and then hanging there

1258.88 --> 1263.8400000000001
for hours on end in a non-stop shot am i

1262.24 --> 1267.36
denying that that exists

1263.84 --> 1270.32
that's correct because it doesn't exist

1267.36 --> 1272.24
i i've asked for it now if you can share

1270.32 --> 1275.52
some of that with me

1272.24 --> 1278.559
that uninterrupted footage

1275.52 --> 1282.07
then yeah maybe you might have some kind

1278.559 --> 1287.1299999999999
of a case of some kind so but

1282.07 --> 1287.1299999999999
[Music]

1294.57 --> 1297.8899999999999
[Music]

1316.84 --> 1319.84
so

1325.679 --> 1333.8400000000001
who's that agm

1339.83 --> 1347.84
[Music]

1342.08 --> 1347.84
you're correct

1363.679 --> 1371.2
right and also yeah there is

1367.679 --> 1374.48
there is just more even to it

1371.2 --> 1376.24
because yeah i have been thinking

1374.48 --> 1377.6
about it for a long time and even

1376.24 --> 1380.24
brought it up

1377.6 --> 1380.799
about what i basically said in response

1380.24 --> 1384.24
to that

1380.799 --> 1386.24
yeah that baller comment and chat

1384.24 --> 1388.799
how there is no single shot

1386.24 --> 1394.08
uninterrupted shot

1388.799 --> 1397.12
from ground to into space as it were

1394.08 --> 1400.48
well i've yeah i've thought about it

1397.12 --> 1401.52
at this point they can literally trick

1400.48 --> 1403.84
that

1401.52 --> 1404.799
they probably have been able to for some

1403.84 --> 1408.0
time

1404.799 --> 1410.48
but they're not doing it they

1408.0 --> 1413.28
they are i think they are deliberately

1410.48 --> 1413.28
not doing it

1414.48 --> 1419.039
and yeah it just makes me think more and

1418.4 --> 1421.2
more

1419.039 --> 1424.08
just looking at nasa overall and all

1421.2 --> 1428.0800000000002
their productions over the ages

1424.08 --> 1431.12
is that they were never meant to

1428.08 --> 1434.1589999999999
actually be proof

1431.12 --> 1436.3999999999999
scientifically at least of

1434.159 --> 1437.7600000000002
outer space and the heliocentric model

1436.4 --> 1440.24
and all that

1437.76 --> 1442.32
they were only there just to give

1440.24 --> 1445.279
sufficient

1442.32 --> 1447.36
dream footage in order for people to

1445.279 --> 1450.64
keep believing it i think that that is

1447.36 --> 1452.7199999999998
their only real function because

1450.64 --> 1454.7990000000002
otherwise they they should have done a

1452.72 --> 1458.08
better job

1454.799 --> 1461.039
at showing more hard to unravel

1458.08 --> 1461.84
proof as it were but they're not doing

1461.039 --> 1464.72
that

1461.84 --> 1466.9599999999998
and it just seems like they're not

1464.72 --> 1472.24
supposed to do that

1466.96 --> 1474.96
more and more the more i look at it

1472.24 --> 1474.96
over the years

1483.52 --> 1487.44
so maybe they only ever were this chain

1486.48 --> 1490.96
in the link

1487.44 --> 1491.8400000000001
they're they're there to give the people

1490.96 --> 1494.0
that don't

1491.84 --> 1496.32
they don't have any more curiosity

1494.0 --> 1499.679
towards the nature of reality to give

1496.32 --> 1501.9189999999999
them the dreams that they long for

1499.679 --> 1503.44
and to provide an opportunity for those

1501.919 --> 1506.48
that are curious

1503.44 --> 1509.679
and smart and inquisitive

1506.48 --> 1512.0
to find out that it is a dream be

1509.679 --> 1513.679
be personally challenged in their ego

1512.0 --> 1515.6
because of that

1513.679 --> 1518.24
oh and then potentially hopefully

1515.6 --> 1522.1589999999999
overcome it

1518.24 --> 1526.24
and send to the next tear as it were

1522.159 --> 1530.24
or descend into baller hood

1526.24 --> 1530.24
and become like a religious fanatic

1532.24 --> 1536.4
what do you guys think it just seems

1535.76 --> 1538.24
like there's

1536.4 --> 1539.76
they're doing exactly what they're

1538.24 --> 1541.6
supposed to be doing

1539.76 --> 1544.96
they're supposed to be ridiculous and

1541.6 --> 1547.6789999999999
maybe they've grown even more stupid

1544.96 --> 1549.76
not because the staff is getting worse

1547.679 --> 1552.48
or whatever

1549.76 --> 1554.48
the direction is just fooling up some

1552.48 --> 1557.3600000000001
mock-up no maybe they've done it

1554.48 --> 1557.84
on purpose because they're afraid that

1557.36 --> 1560.7199999999998
the

1557.84 --> 1561.12
average level of intelligence has just

1560.72 --> 1564.159
gone

1561.12 --> 1567.76
down so they have to make it more stupid

1564.159 --> 1571.8400000000001
or it'll fool too many people

1567.76 --> 1585.84
maybe that's the reason

1571.84 --> 1585.84
anybody ever thought about that

1588.43 --> 1592.489
[Music]

1607.679 --> 1613.8400000000001
right of course if an addict will go any

1610.96 --> 1613.8400000000001
lengths

1614.0 --> 1627.84
to reaffirm their religion

1617.12 --> 1627.84
or their point of view as you say yeah

1635.039 --> 1641.84
lights in the sky not new what

1646.08 --> 1650.559
the coffee is the best okey-dokey

1652.159 --> 1657.919
yeah one cup of coffee is enough for me

1655.84 --> 1659.36
and i did get some new coffee by the way

1657.919 --> 1669.8400000000001
because

1659.36 --> 1669.84
yeah oh man

1678.399 --> 1682.1589999999999
i think i might also be feeling a little

1680.399 --> 1685.039
bit weird because i basically

1682.159 --> 1687.0390000000002
had my dinner too late after 12 and

1685.039 --> 1689.6
that's usually not very good for my

1687.039 --> 1691.2
metabolism when i do that

1689.6 --> 1693.76
i think it has something to do with that

1691.2 --> 1697.679
as well because right after that i

1693.76 --> 1699.84
kind of felt like sick for a while

1697.679 --> 1700.72
not when i was sleeping but usually when

1699.84 --> 1703.9189999999999
i do that

1700.72 --> 1705.3600000000001
then the next morning it's like my

1703.919 --> 1708.72
metabolism

1705.36 --> 1712.799
rhythm goes off compared to

1708.72 --> 1715.1200000000001
what it should be during the sleep cycle

1712.799 --> 1716.799
yeah it basically comes down to you yeah

1715.12 --> 1719.9189999999999
you shouldn't eat

1716.799 --> 1720.32
large meals too shortly before you go to

1719.919 --> 1722.72
bed

1720.32 --> 1725.84
because it gets in the way of your

1722.72 --> 1725.84
sleeping cycle

1726.32 --> 1732.08
right by the way a lot of ladybugs

1729.919 --> 1738.64
crawling around

1732.08 --> 1740.8799999999999
it's funny a lot of them take a look at

1738.64 --> 1740.88
this

1746.48 --> 1750.48
oh god youtube is so slow

1751.44 --> 1754.64
right you can see it right there

1758.32 --> 1767.84
i'm just walking over the place

1774.0 --> 1781.84
it's a bit of an odd time by the way for

1776.08 --> 1781.84
ladybugs kind of odd

1783.08 --> 1786.1799999999998
[Music]

1788.0 --> 1796.08
bugs when i get into a warm home indeed

1791.52 --> 1798.799
yeah you know and my home is pretty much

1796.08 --> 1800.08
the outside door is usually open so i

1798.799 --> 1802.96
get a lot of

1800.08 --> 1804.77
yeah creatures taking refuge against the

1802.96 --> 1806.559
window

1804.77 --> 1808.559
[Music]

1806.559 --> 1809.6789999999999
fly is not welcome because they tend to

1808.559 --> 1811.6789999999999
get very annoying

1809.679 --> 1815.039
mosquitoes neither but there's all kinds

1811.679 --> 1815.039
of yeah creatures

1817.039 --> 1824.0
from crickets like the green

1820.399 --> 1826.799
type of crickets ladybugs and

1824.0 --> 1828.559
spiders are literally always welcome and

1826.799 --> 1830.559
there's yeah it's not a tropical region

1828.559 --> 1830.8799999999999
so they're not creepy [ __ ] up spiders

1830.559 --> 1833.12
but

1830.88 --> 1837.1200000000001
yeah spiders are great because they eat

1833.12 --> 1840.2399999999998
the mosquitoes and fly so i love them

1837.12 --> 1840.2399999999998
never remove them

1843.12 --> 1846.8799999999999
spiders in me got an understanding

1848.84 --> 1851.84
and

1852.0 --> 1856.559
right yeah i don't mind i'm not scared

1854.08 --> 1856.559
of bugs

1856.88 --> 1860.3200000000002
i used to be scared of bugs when i was a

1858.72 --> 1861.1200000000001
little kid i thought they were really

1860.32 --> 1865.84
freaky

1861.12 --> 1865.84
now not so much anymore

1869.36 --> 1873.039
and for me it's also funny to basically

1871.6 --> 1875.12
try to

1873.039 --> 1876.48
sensory interface with them using my

1875.12 --> 1878.559
intuition because they do

1876.48 --> 1880.64
have like their own little spirit it's

1878.559 --> 1884.24
just

1880.64 --> 1887.279
it's almost so it's almost computerized

1884.24 --> 1890.08
how simplistic it is

1887.279 --> 1890.96
like insects don't have issues with

1890.08 --> 1894.32
anything

1890.96 --> 1894.32
they don't have the senses

1894.64 --> 1900.96
they're just they're like robots

1897.84 --> 1906.799
but they do have

1900.96 --> 1909.2
a limited limited sort of consciousness

1906.799 --> 1910.6399999999999
like they feel the presence of other

1909.2 --> 1921.8400000000001
creatures

1910.64 --> 1921.8400000000001
and all that i find that interesting

1921.87 --> 1924.9799999999998
[Music]

1932.84 --> 1935.84
hmm

1946.84 --> 1949.84
so

1956.159 --> 1962.64
ah right yeah every man's uh

1959.519 --> 1965.2
a ramistan stone yes

1962.64 --> 1968.7990000000002
science fiction writer i have written

1965.2 --> 1968.799
very short pieces the thing is

1971.679 --> 1976.64
i'm not much of a like a book writer

1974.96 --> 1979.8400000000001
like that

1976.64 --> 1979.8400000000001
like i don't like

1981.279 --> 1986.399
i don't know i i like trying to convey

1984.399 --> 1989.5189999999998
things and structures and then laying it

1986.399 --> 1993.36
out nice but to write a story

1989.519 --> 1994.64
is very different i have a little bit

1993.36 --> 1997.6789999999999
more trouble with that

1994.64 --> 2000.64
to basically build a story for

1997.679 --> 2001.76
reading as it were like that and i've

2000.64 --> 2005.2
tried this

2001.76 --> 2007.279
back in the past too like even at school

2005.2 --> 2008.96
i had a time when it was yeah very

2007.279 --> 2011.279
rebellious and then as

2008.96 --> 2012.88
like very creative teacher said okay

2011.279 --> 2015.519
every time you're going to

2012.88 --> 2016.3200000000002
step out of line your punishment is you

2015.519 --> 2019.84
have to write

2016.32 --> 2019.84
two pages

2019.919 --> 2025.279
and then yeah i basically started using

2022.96 --> 2028.32
that to write like this weird time-based

2025.279 --> 2031.519
science fiction little book

2028.32 --> 2033.76
that was really stupid

2031.519 --> 2035.44
but it was literally the first time i

2033.76 --> 2038.399
actually tried to write a story

2035.44 --> 2038.72
man looking back it it's been pathetic

2038.399 --> 2041.1999999999998
this

2038.72 --> 2042.24
is i'm not not that good of a story

2041.2 --> 2044.799
writer i'm much

2042.24 --> 2044.799
more of a

2045.679 --> 2052.8
like like a planner like i like

2049.2 --> 2056.1589999999997
setups i like having oversight and

2052.8 --> 2058.7200000000003
seeing like hey there's this village

2056.159 --> 2062.079
it's in this place there is that there

2058.72 --> 2064.3199999999997
is that this is the societal situation

2062.079 --> 2066.079
and then just try to imagine okay

2064.32 --> 2067.76
what are they going to do what would be

2066.079 --> 2070.079
the most natural

2067.76 --> 2072.079
now that is some very different from

2070.079 --> 2072.7200000000003
typical story writing it's more like a

2072.079 --> 2075.9190000000003
scene

2072.72 --> 2076.72
setting type of thing and it's very

2075.919 --> 2078.6389999999997
useful in

2076.72 --> 2080.72
dungeons and dragons as a game master

2078.639 --> 2084.3990000000003
which i'm also

2080.72 --> 2086.7999999999997
because there it works great works great

2084.399 --> 2091.04
but um if i'm literally going to have to

2086.8 --> 2091.04
write the story beat the characters

2091.839 --> 2096.48
i don't know i've never managed to

2094.159 --> 2098.32
really successfully

2096.48 --> 2100.16
put something down that i thought hey

2098.32 --> 2104.7200000000003
this is actually a good story

2100.16 --> 2104.72
no quite disappointed actually

2105.92 --> 2113.04
yeah maybe it's because of my

2109.76 --> 2116.5600000000004
lessened social skills

2113.04 --> 2119.7599999999998
that i don't have as much

2116.56 --> 2122.88
feeling for what just goes naturally

2119.76 --> 2123.92
when socially interacting compared to

2122.88 --> 2125.92
most people

2123.92 --> 2127.359
i think that gets in the way of

2125.92 --> 2131.28
basically finding us

2127.359 --> 2133.2
a good standard approach that feels

2131.28 --> 2136.8
natural because i have trouble with that

2133.2 --> 2136.7999999999997
in face-to-face communication

2138.16 --> 2145.839
so that would explain it

2141.2 --> 2145.839
but i have written conceptual pieces

2168.56 --> 2175.68
right but this is the thing you know

2172.72 --> 2176.0789999999997
i've literally multiple people that i

2175.68 --> 2178.3999999999996
know

2176.079 --> 2180.6400000000003
including my ex by the way who was also

2178.4 --> 2183.28
writing a book

2180.64 --> 2184.0
for a very long time what i do is kind

2183.28 --> 2187.0400000000004
of like

2184.0 --> 2187.44
get involved and then think of basically

2187.04 --> 2189.68
think

2187.44 --> 2191.599
like what about this what about that i

2189.68 --> 2194.48
think this would be the general

2191.599 --> 2198.7200000000003
atmosphere in this type of scenario

2194.48 --> 2200.96
like i don't have to get concerned with

2198.72 --> 2201.839
how the story is going i'm simply

2200.96 --> 2204.64
looking at

2201.839 --> 2206.0
some part that another writer has

2204.64 --> 2209.359
basically put down

2206.0 --> 2211.44
or a player one of my players in

2209.359 --> 2212.56
my dnd game as a game master it's kind

2211.44 --> 2215.599
of the same

2212.56 --> 2218.24
but in this case it was my ex just

2215.599 --> 2219.2000000000003
sharing that and i looked into it and i

2218.24 --> 2222.4799999999996
basically

2219.2 --> 2224.56
gave my insights

2222.48 --> 2225.52
and afterwards she said she was very

2224.56 --> 2229.52
thankful for

2225.52 --> 2233.28
she was very she was she started writing

2229.52 --> 2236.88
con she's she basically adapted much

2233.28 --> 2236.88
of her original idea whoa

2237.119 --> 2247.92
whoa tomahawk helicopter what the [ __ ]

2243.119 --> 2247.92
military tunnel okay

2252.16 --> 2259.839
don't see that every day

2257.599 --> 2259.839
hmm

2266.0 --> 2273.119
but yeah that way somebody else

2270.48 --> 2275.119
is working on something as a story or

2273.119 --> 2278.88
basically making decisions

2275.119 --> 2281.76
me taking in what they've built

2278.88 --> 2282.7200000000003
and kind of polishing the details or

2281.76 --> 2285.3590000000004
seeing like hey

2282.72 --> 2287.2
this fits right in there wouldn't that

2285.359 --> 2290.16
be great to add on to it

2287.2 --> 2290.48
there you go you can have it i'm giving

2290.16 --> 2292.96
you

2290.48 --> 2293.92
this as an outsider for you as a story

2292.96 --> 2296.56
writer

2293.92 --> 2299.839
and i've done that sort of thing on

2296.56 --> 2299.839
multiple occasions

2301.119 --> 2304.6400000000003
and yeah some of these occasions i

2303.68 --> 2307.2
cannot

2304.64 --> 2308.56
literally confirm because i've also done

2307.2 --> 2312.0
this sort of thing

2308.56 --> 2314.24
when i was in a pretty yeah not

2312.0 --> 2315.839
too well aware of my surrounding

2314.24 --> 2318.64
situations

2315.839 --> 2319.119
like when i was high as [ __ ] i would

2318.64 --> 2322.24
also

2319.119 --> 2323.04
just do it i when i was like high and

2322.24 --> 2326.56
just like

2323.04 --> 2328.16
barely responsible i was auto

2326.56 --> 2330.48
like i'm not gonna do [ __ ] but i was

2328.16 --> 2331.1189999999997
basically acting like a rebellion

2330.48 --> 2334.2400000000002
teenager

2331.119 --> 2336.0
just being stoned out of their minds but

2334.24 --> 2336.64
i would still have my intellect and i

2336.0 --> 2338.72
would do

2336.64 --> 2340.0
this kind of what i'm doing now in a

2338.72 --> 2343.9199999999996
much more controlled fashion

2340.0 --> 2346.48
i would do this just the same in between

2343.92 --> 2348.32
so i've given people like a lot of

2346.48 --> 2350.2400000000002
different types of advice

2348.32 --> 2352.6400000000003
most of which i don't even remember

2350.24 --> 2352.64
anymore

2353.44 --> 2361.04
because i've that doing that

2356.8 --> 2364.079
gave me this weird unique feeling of

2361.04 --> 2368.4
of comfort like

2364.079 --> 2370.6400000000003
okay at least i'm not completely useless

2368.4 --> 2371.599
because i'm helping this person making

2370.64 --> 2377.5989999999997
what they're building

2371.599 --> 2377.599
better yeah and that's why i did that

2381.44 --> 2384.32
what is that

2388.4 --> 2390.96
okay

2395.28 --> 2398.48
all right yeah good call

2400.32 --> 2405.599
oh but it's just like what are you doing

2403.28 --> 2405.599
here

2407.28 --> 2416.6400000000003
i i literally have not mentioned

2410.96 --> 2416.64
the word a single time yet

2416.72 --> 2423.04
except in names of

2420.0 --> 2426.16
shows so what the [ __ ] are you

2423.04 --> 2426.16
complaining about man

2430.079 --> 2434.079
i can't believe you ever got high you

2431.92 --> 2434.8
seem so normal well it is because i got

2434.079 --> 2438.48
so high

2434.8 --> 2440.5600000000004
in my teens that now i don't get as high

2438.48 --> 2444.319
anymore

2440.56 --> 2447.359
but holy [ __ ] dude seriously like

2444.319 --> 2448.72
look i started started smoking when i

2447.359 --> 2452.319
was 15

2448.72 --> 2455.1189999999997
secretly some of my buddies

2452.319 --> 2456.319
later went completely straight off the

2455.119 --> 2459.6800000000003
path into

2456.319 --> 2461.839
creepy [ __ ] like the guy that originally

2459.68 --> 2465.44
started smoking that with

2461.839 --> 2466.319
like he went like started smoking crack

2465.44 --> 2469.359
and [ __ ]

2466.319 --> 2472.24
he got off it again but he went like

2469.359 --> 2473.7599999999998
deep into [ __ ] deep into psychological

2472.24 --> 2476.64
doodle and

2473.76 --> 2477.5200000000004
that was pretty freaky realizing that

2476.64 --> 2479.359
afterward

2477.52 --> 2481.7599999999998
because i didn't see him after that for

2479.359 --> 2484.88
a while and then that turned out to had

2481.76 --> 2487.92
happened all that 10 years later

2484.88 --> 2492.1600000000003
but back in the day man like

2487.92 --> 2495.28
up until i was pretty much like 19

2492.16 --> 2497.359
every single time i'd smoke a joint and

2495.28 --> 2499.599
and you know you have to realize those

2497.359 --> 2502.0
joints the weed back then was not as

2499.599 --> 2505.6800000000003
good and strong as it is now

2502.0 --> 2509.04
but holy [ __ ] dude it's like every time

2505.68 --> 2513.1189999999997
i smoke the joint it would be like

2509.04 --> 2513.119
just five hours

2513.92 --> 2520.64
dude exactly like this is

2518.56 --> 2522.48
yeah i'm looking at myself on the camera

2520.64 --> 2526.48
that's pretty much how that looks like

2522.48 --> 2531.28
dude or like having major munchie

2526.48 --> 2531.28
issues all that

2533.28 --> 2540.96
i'm kidding yeah really horny

2537.119 --> 2544.6400000000003
with my girlfriend but

2540.96 --> 2546.8
yeah after yeah after some time it just

2544.64 --> 2549.68
it doesn't make that much of an impact

2546.8 --> 2552.7200000000003
anymore it's like the wooziness kind of

2549.68 --> 2556.56
started to slow down

2552.72 --> 2559.2
but the other effects

2556.56 --> 2559.7599999999998
like the more i guess mind altering

2559.2 --> 2562.96
effects

2559.76 --> 2566.4
mind assisting effects for the

2562.96 --> 2568.48
division organ that part of the mind

2566.4 --> 2570.88
yeah that it hasn't really gone away

2568.48 --> 2575.2
that's only

2570.88 --> 2575.2000000000003
yeah sharpened up actually because of it

2577.359 --> 2582.88
because it was bred for thc why would

2580.72 --> 2582.8799999999997
you

2583.359 --> 2587.359
oh before it was bradford yeah yeah yeah

2586.079 --> 2589.52
right exactly

2587.359 --> 2592.0789999999997
because it had a lot more of just the

2589.52 --> 2594.72
other natural components

2592.079 --> 2595.6800000000003
because cannabis has so many different

2594.72 --> 2598.8799999999997
thingies in it

2595.68 --> 2598.8799999999997
it's crazy

2599.599 --> 2604.4
it's like the cbd and the thc but there

2602.4 --> 2608.56
is a whole

2604.4 --> 2611.76
batch of other unique organic compounds

2608.56 --> 2614.64
that combined with it all does all kinds

2611.76 --> 2617.76
of things and yeah

2614.64 --> 2620.16
it's now just being kind of like

2617.76 --> 2621.28
weaponized into more pure drug

2620.16 --> 2624.0789999999997
experience

2621.28 --> 2624.079
unfortunately

2626.0 --> 2631.359
but then again look that's mostly just

2629.2 --> 2633.9199999999996
the mainline weed sellers right

2631.359 --> 2635.839
because it sells that's just the easiest

2633.92 --> 2636.319
but of course cannabis development has

2635.839 --> 2638.0789999999997
gone in

2636.319 --> 2639.839
all directions there's so many things

2638.079 --> 2643.52
possible so many

2639.839 --> 2645.92
unique type of traits traits weeds

2643.52 --> 2645.92
all that

2646.72 --> 2652.319
but yeah what we all get shoved in our

2650.64 --> 2655.5989999999997
faces by the sellers

2652.319 --> 2658.7799999999997
is more standardized just

2655.599 --> 2660.2400000000002
thc rich cannabis

2658.78 --> 2662.48
[Music]

2660.24 --> 2663.9199999999996
because it makes you high and then you

2662.48 --> 2666.88
want to come back for more

2663.92 --> 2666.88
like that so

2668.48 --> 2673.359
the whole turbine profile gives the

2670.56 --> 2673.359
effect hmm

2673.92 --> 2677.839
all right

2681.44 --> 2685.68
yeah the old skunk was weird man

2686.0 --> 2691.839
but i've also had some bad trips on

2688.079 --> 2691.8390000000004
skunk too back in the 90s

2695.359 --> 2699.68
because that did happen back then you

2697.28 --> 2702.6400000000003
know back then i could literally just

2699.68 --> 2704.96
smoke too much and then basically go in

2702.64 --> 2708.0789999999997
a panic

2704.96 --> 2711.839
now that doesn't happen anymore i do

2708.079 --> 2715.04
get like hey my body is being

2711.839 --> 2719.04
set to the sort of potential panic

2715.04 --> 2721.839
position but it doesn't really

2719.04 --> 2723.7599999999998
snap anymore because i've got things so

2721.839 --> 2725.599
much better under control when i have

2723.76 --> 2729.599
these substances in me

2725.599 --> 2732.4
it doesn't fluster me as much anymore

2729.599 --> 2733.119
so hey if i smoke a really really big

2732.4 --> 2735.119
joint

2733.119 --> 2737.119
then yeah it might at first make a big

2735.119 --> 2738.319
impact but i'd experience it mostly as

2737.119 --> 2740.319
just getting

2738.319 --> 2742.0
knocked out getting really tired for

2740.319 --> 2743.44
just a short moment

2742.0 --> 2745.44
then after a while it's like i'm

2743.44 --> 2748.4
catching my breath again and

2745.44 --> 2751.2000000000003
i'm great it doesn't last hours and

2748.4 --> 2751.2000000000003
hours and hours

2753.68 --> 2757.1189999999997
and i'm glad of it you know there's

2755.599 --> 2759.2000000000003
there's this weird thing

2757.119 --> 2760.1600000000003
about cannabis and cannabis smoking for

2759.2 --> 2763.839
me

2760.16 --> 2766.0789999999997
when i'm smoking regularly

2763.839 --> 2766.88
it's it's really great it's fine the

2766.079 --> 2769.8390000000004
only

2766.88 --> 2770.48
downside to me ever really is the the

2769.839 --> 2774.96
the

2770.48 --> 2778.8
the money what it cost me but

2774.96 --> 2780.88
i can't alter it really how i do it

2778.8 --> 2782.5600000000004
because if i decide oh no no i'm not

2780.88 --> 2783.2000000000003
gonna do this anymore i'm just gonna

2782.56 --> 2786.16
smoke

2783.2 --> 2788.0789999999997
one joint every saturday or something

2786.16 --> 2791.839
like that you know and i use i i

2788.079 --> 2793.3590000000004
had done that for periods

2791.839 --> 2796.0789999999997
but i stopped doing that because i

2793.359 --> 2799.2799999999997
figured out every time i do that

2796.079 --> 2801.8390000000004
it's like the joint becomes too strong

2799.28 --> 2803.44
and i have too much into anticipation

2801.839 --> 2805.44
for that one moment

2803.44 --> 2807.839
and then it's almost not even worth it

2805.44 --> 2811.119
anymore i i would end up

2807.839 --> 2814.72
every time regretting smoking it

2811.119 --> 2818.7200000000003
so it's to me like either i smoke it

2814.72 --> 2823.7599999999998
regularly and then enjoy it a lot

2818.72 --> 2823.7599999999998
or i just don't i just don't anymore

2824.64 --> 2829.04
and then completely clear up and that

2827.2 --> 2832.7999999999997
works better for me

2829.04 --> 2832.8
to choose between those two

2836.8 --> 2841.92
right oh it's almost three o'clock

2839.599 --> 2841.92
already

2842.839 --> 2850.16
oh talking about cannabis today

2847.119 --> 2852.7200000000003
so it seems right

2850.16 --> 2855.7599999999998
