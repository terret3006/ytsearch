[Music]

167.44 --> 171.2
jack does of course and they're all very

170.08 --> 174.8
hot

171.2 --> 177.599
despite yeah sometimes there is a

174.8 --> 178.72
nice bit of shade as well but not right

177.599 --> 181.76
now

178.72 --> 185.76
now it's bright

181.76 --> 188.0
and yeah there was storm again yesterday

185.76 --> 190.0
a bit of rain even in the evening but it

188.0 --> 192.72
was nice and refreshing and as a result

190.0 --> 198.48
i did have a very good sleep

192.72 --> 202.56
it's very good

198.48 --> 207.28
so it's sunday

202.56 --> 207.28
uh i did make notes

208.48 --> 216.0
yeah yeah

212.08 --> 217.20000000000002
let's see yeah after the show yesterday

216.0 --> 221.2
uh

217.2 --> 224.64
i just hung around i like i have these

221.2 --> 227.51899999999998
uh you call that

224.64 --> 228.23899999999998
the half beers now with lemon juice like

227.519 --> 231.36
they

228.239 --> 234.31900000000002
basically put half lemon juice

231.36 --> 236.48000000000002
half beer so it's less alcohol and

234.319 --> 237.35999999999999
that's kind of really nice to drink in

236.48 --> 240.0
the afternoon

237.36 --> 240.72000000000003
it doesn't really make me drunk or

240.0 --> 242.56
anything

240.72 --> 244.159
but i think that like this the light

242.56 --> 247.84
alcohol and maybe yeah

244.159 --> 249.12
just all the fluids it does kind of help

247.84 --> 252.4
with the heat

249.12 --> 255.439
it's funny how that works so

252.4 --> 257.44
i've been enjoying that even yeah even

255.439 --> 261.68
before the evening

257.44 --> 261.68
and yeah big bear was live again

262.72 --> 266.639
yeah more on to grabblers and all that

267.12 --> 274.08
basically stating that he would take

270.32 --> 277.36
in real syrian refugees

274.08 --> 280.32
over new york grabblers any day

277.36 --> 281.199
and then expanded a lot upon that lots

280.32 --> 284.08
of letters too

281.199 --> 287.199
was great yeah and then pretty much as

284.08 --> 289.35999999999996
that ended uh ball busters went live

287.199 --> 291.6
and yeah i was the only ball buster

289.36 --> 293.44
besides

291.6 --> 295.759
kiwi that was on pretty much the whole

293.44 --> 296.56
show although like at the last minute

295.759 --> 300.639
nathan

296.56 --> 302.72
dropped in and

300.639 --> 305.6
but yeah it was a pretty good show and i

302.72 --> 305.6
thought that i was

305.68 --> 312.16
yeah it was good to be a part of it

310.16 --> 313.28000000000003
had a couple of good remarks in there

312.16 --> 315.759
and yeah it was a

313.28 --> 317.039
interesting show it was funny i said it

315.759 --> 320.32
even on the show

317.039 --> 324.0
like i had been hoping to get more

320.32 --> 326.56
uh like training about different types

324.0 --> 329.12
of arguments what they really mean

326.56 --> 330.96
and yeah this this kind of halfway

329.12 --> 332.8
helped with that

330.96 --> 334.96
to really get the structure of the

332.8 --> 338.08
scientific method and all the fallacies

334.96 --> 341.68
and all that

338.08 --> 344.639
did anyone use that link right anyway

341.68 --> 348.0
and after that i just i finished

344.639 --> 348.0
watching the mandalorian

348.08 --> 354.88
and yes was definitely interesting

352.16 --> 355.91900000000004
kind of sad to me see the old man alien

354.88 --> 359.52
die

355.919 --> 359.52
although it was like yeah

360.0 --> 366.08
like it was like in battle

363.12 --> 368.319
pretty much and also interesting kind of

366.08 --> 370.4
like how they

368.319 --> 372.47900000000004
during the series they kind of build up

370.4 --> 374.71999999999997
what society is like

372.479 --> 375.919
after the fall of the empire much more

374.72 --> 378.84000000000003
than

375.919 --> 380.96
the follow-up movies after star wars six

378.84 --> 383.52
did

380.96 --> 384.31899999999996
to really show like that just some of

383.52 --> 386.56
the old

384.319 --> 388.96000000000004
guard kind of still wanted it even

386.56 --> 390.639
though there was no centralized command

388.96 --> 393.19899999999996
and

390.639 --> 394.08
and with the mandalorians it it's yeah i

393.199 --> 397.759
find it interesting

394.08 --> 399.68
it it gives it contains a lot of star

397.759 --> 401.52000000000004
wars culture but i already gave hint at

399.68 --> 405.199
that

401.52 --> 406.24
and yeah i liked it kind of looking

405.199 --> 410.0
forward to

406.24 --> 412.639
finding the second season for download

410.0 --> 413.12
but i yeah i'm patient but man that

412.639 --> 416.16
series

413.12 --> 417.919
it's very short so you really

416.16 --> 420.08000000000004
yeah if you like it you're gonna rush

417.919 --> 423.12
through it really quickly

420.08 --> 426.0
probably within three hours or something

423.12 --> 427.12
just gonna if you really like star wars

426.0 --> 431.039
you're gonna watch it

427.12 --> 433.12
very quickly uh

431.039 --> 434.56
and yeah the music by the way is a bit

433.12 --> 437.759
weird i thought

434.56 --> 440.96
like it's still there the classical

437.759 --> 444.0
star wars music but they sometimes

440.96 --> 447.919
very subtly though not overkill uh

444.0 --> 449.759
blend in a little electronic and it's

447.919 --> 451.34
sometimes it fit really well and

449.759 --> 452.639
sometimes it's almost like

451.34 --> 456.71999999999997
[Music]

452.639 --> 459.12
i don't know about this but

456.72 --> 461.59900000000005
yeah at least it was kind of subtle how

459.12 --> 461.599
they did it

461.68 --> 466.96
it wasn't super flashy and attention

465.039 --> 469.26
grabby overall and i like that about the

466.96 --> 470.4
series

469.26 --> 472.479
[Music]

470.4 --> 474.87899999999996
right so that was that and then this

472.479 --> 474.87899999999996
morning

475.68 --> 481.919
this morning was hilarious yeah i on the

478.639 --> 481.919
watched spurs chemo

482.08 --> 486.96
pretty much was watching it

485.12 --> 489.039
right before this show started i think

486.96 --> 492.4
it's still going

489.039 --> 495.12
and nick was in chat again

492.4 --> 496.71999999999997
and nick was doubling down by what he

495.12 --> 499.12
said

496.72 --> 500.319
that boyle's law doesn't apply to the

499.12 --> 502.639
earth

500.319 --> 503.68
and it doesn't apply to the universe and

502.639 --> 506.72
then i kept

503.68 --> 508.56
just saying like are you really sure

506.72 --> 511.28000000000003
and then he went oh yeah yeah because

508.56 --> 515.2
the earth's atmosphere does not

511.28 --> 516.24
abide by the the necessary conditions to

515.2 --> 519.44
which boyle's law

516.24 --> 521.44
applies and then i'm like okay

519.44 --> 523.599
but you didn't say earth's atmosphere

521.44 --> 524.399
you said earth and we're talking about a

523.599 --> 528.32
law

524.399 --> 532.399
and laws have domains they have

528.32 --> 534.72
a domain to which they apply as a law

532.399 --> 536.16
and guess what the domain for boyle's

534.72 --> 538.64
law is

536.16 --> 541.04
how it's been established how any law is

538.64 --> 543.68
established it's on earth

541.04 --> 544.24
so yeah boyle's law does definitely

543.68 --> 547.04
apply

544.24 --> 548.0
to earth you know it might not apply

547.04 --> 551.279
directly to

548.0 --> 554.959
the atmosphere or the gases

551.279 --> 557.2
on earth but it applies to earth

554.959 --> 558.3199999999999
because earth is the domain the law

557.2 --> 561.36
applies to

558.32 --> 563.36
so he totally was wrong he realized it

561.36 --> 566.0
and then he backtracked and said

563.36 --> 567.519
no no i said atmosphere i'm pretty sure

566.0 --> 571.04
i said atmosphere and i said

567.519 --> 574.0
no no i screenshotted it

571.04 --> 576.3199999999999
you did not say atmosphere so that that

574.0 --> 578.08
was kind of funny

576.32 --> 579.7600000000001
you know it's pretty tough to make

578.08 --> 585.12
people like nick realize

579.76 --> 588.399
anything especially a mistake

585.12 --> 588.399
when it's really a mistake

588.8 --> 592.7199999999999
anyway we've been back and forth again

590.64 --> 595.68
chat at the super scheme i hang out for

592.72 --> 595.6800000000001
a while about that

596.72 --> 603.6
uh yeah and then i started the show

600.48 --> 605.2
so let's see who's in chat so far i see

603.6 --> 608.24
a good servant who's first

605.2 --> 612.32
he was also in that chat so he was there

608.24 --> 616.399
uh no curve michael jones

612.32 --> 620.5600000000001

628.0 --> 630.32
you know

631.839 --> 635.0400000000001
and then tell him it's live because i'm

633.519 --> 636.48
now going to be more dependent on that

635.04 --> 641.04
since

636.48 --> 641.04
yeah it doesn't work the way it used to

651.12 --> 661.839
hold on delete

666.0 --> 670.399
stupid it is like what

672.839 --> 679.36
huh okay

676.24 --> 682.24
right so now

679.36 --> 682.24
what is this

685.6 --> 689.519
youtube really doesn't know how it's

688.079 --> 693.12
working anymore

689.519 --> 694.8
this is so weird oh yeah by the way

693.12 --> 695.839
thank you good servant for putting the

694.8 --> 698.4799999999999
link out in the

695.839 --> 698.48
other chat

699.44 --> 705.36
i'm gonna delete that one try to delete

702.48 --> 705.36
it's not that easy

709.6 --> 717.839
where was it again how do you do that

714.839 --> 717.839
again

722.48 --> 727.519
all right add the dots delete

728.839 --> 735.9200000000001
yes

731.36 --> 735.92
okay so that one is gone

738.32 --> 742.399
and this one is still going i think

740.16 --> 742.399
right

742.839 --> 748.9590000000001
yeah so didn't accidentally

746.0 --> 748.959
delete the wrong one

749.76 --> 752.079
right

756.839 --> 763.7800000000001
just all right so anyway

761.92 --> 764.959
uh

763.78 --> 766.72
[Music]

764.959 --> 768.079
right i already went through all my

766.72 --> 771.2
notes oh wait i forgot

768.079 --> 774.56
my drinks of course is more

771.2 --> 777.2
orange juice with honey diluted with

774.56 --> 777.1999999999999
lots of water

784.839 --> 791.0400000000001
and just regular water

788.8 --> 794.399
and a tangerine and i got a foot bath

791.04 --> 794.399
too for emergencies

797.519 --> 803.839
why are we losing people

801.279 --> 804.48
it's just because normally because of

803.839 --> 806.639
the change

804.48 --> 808.9590000000001
normally i have my hangout open at least

806.639 --> 810.639
half an hour before and people can then

808.959 --> 812.7199999999999
leak and chat and you can see it on my

810.639 --> 814.24
front page now with the way it works

812.72 --> 816.88
it doesn't work like that anymore i

814.24 --> 820.399
can't start up the hangout through that

816.88 --> 820.399
method it just doesn't work

821.04 --> 824.3199999999999
so i just have to start it up from

823.04 --> 826.24
nothing

824.32 --> 828.399
and then hope that people will share the

826.24 --> 830.0790000000001
show and remind people because you can't

828.399 --> 831.92
even find it on my front page you now

830.079 --> 834.4799999999999
have to look in videos

831.92 --> 836.16
and then you will see it live can't see

834.48 --> 837.1990000000001
it on the front page anymore thanks

836.16 --> 843.8389999999999
youtube

837.199 --> 843.8389999999999
great thanks a lot

848.399 --> 851.6
right anyway

853.12 --> 857.839
any subject anyone wanted to talk about

861.36 --> 864.72
restrictions no it's not restrictions

863.44 --> 867.9200000000001
agm it's

864.72 --> 867.9200000000001
interface issues

869.12 --> 875.36
like the way everything is structured

872.8 --> 877.3599999999999
and they've been they basically deleted

875.36 --> 878.8000000000001
an old format that i've been using a

877.36 --> 880.72
very long time

878.8 --> 882.56
they're already kind of pushing it away

880.72 --> 884.639
but you could still utilize it i think

882.56 --> 887.3599999999999
you still can sort of but it's just

884.639 --> 887.36
confusing

892.399 --> 896.24
it's become very confusing trying to

895.12 --> 899.76
build a

896.24 --> 900.24
show on youtube to me i don't know other

899.76 --> 902.0
people

900.24 --> 903.6
might already know the new system and

902.0 --> 904.16
figure it out hey that's why i'm kind of

903.6 --> 907.1990000000001
asking

904.16 --> 912.3199999999999
if anyone would like to help me figure

907.199 --> 916.399
this out again yes

912.32 --> 916.399
starting 8012 it is frustrating

918.079 --> 923.4399999999999
oh yes martin tolberg i have seen that

921.519 --> 926.72
yeah i forgot to make a note about it

923.44 --> 931.2790000000001
but i did watch alex jones 2

926.72 --> 933.1990000000001
before big bear and i watched the uh

931.279 --> 934.56
the shadowgate documentary actually

933.199 --> 938.56
through mike adams

934.56 --> 941.4399999999999
and later uh through

938.56 --> 942.2399999999999
or a part of it i think no i don't think

941.44 --> 944.32
they showed it

942.24 --> 945.759
but i watched the thing through a

944.32 --> 949.36
article

945.759 --> 949.36
over at natural news

951.04 --> 957.36
it was staged i don't know

954.72 --> 958.1600000000001
i don't think so might have been

957.36 --> 961.12
arranged

958.16 --> 963.36
somehow there may be theatrical elements

961.12 --> 966.72
in some way about it

963.36 --> 969.04
but it's not literally staged

966.72 --> 971.44
i think these things are really

969.04 --> 973.68
happening to them

971.44 --> 973.6800000000001
but

975.839 --> 983.839
yeah it's always weird how it works

984.16 --> 988.48
i don't know it's kind of similar to the

986.72 --> 992.0
roger stone situation

988.48 --> 993.839
and they do equate it it is like

992.0 --> 997.12
political targeting because

993.839 --> 1000.5600000000001
these people are specific

997.12 --> 1003.279
yeah specifically championing

1000.56 --> 1004.079
in a certain way that is i guess very

1003.279 --> 1011.8389999999999
effective

1004.079 --> 1011.8389999999999
and that makes them more of a threat

1012.0 --> 1018.399
and i kind of like him despite issues

1015.92 --> 1020.3199999999999
i always thought millie was like really

1018.399 --> 1023.199
nice and kind of hot

1020.32 --> 1025.679
yeah the roger stone i don't know at

1023.199 --> 1028.8799999999999
first i didn't really like him

1025.679 --> 1031.679
but then yeah i kind of got to know him

1028.88 --> 1034.16
through alex jones on which he was a

1031.679 --> 1036.3190000000002
guest a lot especially early

1034.16 --> 1038.559
and yeah i don't know he's just he

1036.319 --> 1040.799
actually does really seem like a good

1038.559 --> 1044.079
guy

1040.799 --> 1048.079
the very strong will

1044.079 --> 1050.6399999999999
will of his own and i don't know

1048.079 --> 1053.84
my centuries do tell me that he actually

1050.64 --> 1053.8400000000001
is a decent guy

1055.919 --> 1059.8400000000001
so yeah i don't know i mentioned that

1058.16 --> 1064.4
before i think but

1059.84 --> 1064.3999999999999
yeah millie you know

1065.039 --> 1069.2
i don't think it's really faked and i

1066.72 --> 1071.2
hope that she does get out of this

1069.2 --> 1073.8400000000001
you know they have strong backing and

1071.2 --> 1076.0
all that they are provided for they know

1073.84 --> 1078.1599999999999
the judicial system how to work on it

1076.0 --> 1081.12
they got plenty of lawyers

1078.16 --> 1084.559
though it will always cost them but i do

1081.12 --> 1086.1599999999999
hope that this situation is rectified

1084.559 --> 1089.28
without anyone getting hurt and

1086.16 --> 1089.28
especially her children

1090.72 --> 1097.6000000000001
you know

1095.12 --> 1097.6
anyway

1099.84 --> 1107.12
no very shitty connections yeah duh

1104.24 --> 1111.679
but he's kind of admitted to that he was

1107.12 --> 1111.6789999999999
just a guy that did that sort of thing

1114.64 --> 1120.8400000000001
that doesn't make him like a

1117.84 --> 1122.799
like a double agent situation or

1120.84 --> 1137.84
anything

1122.799 --> 1137.84
you know

1138.64 --> 1144.72
okay michael jones hey if that is what

1141.919 --> 1144.72
you thought about

1146.32 --> 1149.6789999999999
but it is kind of interesting isn't it

1148.32 --> 1153.76
when you're confronted

1149.679 --> 1156.5590000000002
with basically physics lessons

1153.76 --> 1157.12
because in in many ways the flat earth

1156.559 --> 1160.24
debates

1157.12 --> 1163.28
is just physics class it really is

1160.24 --> 1164.24
it's pretty advanced physics class and

1163.28 --> 1166.48
yeah

1164.24 --> 1168.16
once you really start to get it you do

1166.48 --> 1172.88
see it in everything

1168.16 --> 1175.52
i do too yes it's everywhere

1172.88 --> 1175.5200000000002
it's nature

1176.24 --> 1180.24
and it's yeah design as well things that

1179.2 --> 1182.96
we make

1180.24 --> 1182.96
it applies

1190.84 --> 1194.9599999999998
hmm

1193.039 --> 1198.32
yeah hey amanda young by the way good to

1194.96 --> 1198.32
see you fine found it too

1201.11 --> 1206.3999999999999
[Music]

1203.36 --> 1209.52
right so but shadowgate i watched it

1206.4 --> 1213.679
it was actually really good

1209.52 --> 1216.4
and i don't know it it was

1213.679 --> 1217.3600000000001
assembled also in a tasteful way with a

1216.4 --> 1218.96
good pace

1217.36 --> 1220.799
it's difficult it's always been

1218.96 --> 1224.0
difficult for

1220.799 --> 1227.039
these types of conspiracy informative

1224.0 --> 1230.799
movies and i thought it was

1227.039 --> 1234.32
really well made very detailed

1230.799 --> 1236.24
but still yeah i got i basically watched

1234.32 --> 1238.3999999999999
it without dozing off or just

1236.24 --> 1240.159
cutting it off at some point no it was

1238.4 --> 1244.24
it was a good presentation

1240.159 --> 1245.7600000000002
and it was good to look through all of

1244.24 --> 1247.52
it again

1245.76 --> 1249.52
because a lot of these things i have

1247.52 --> 1252.799
basically through alex jones

1249.52 --> 1254.72
show have already been informed to i was

1252.799 --> 1257.679
watching while some of these things were

1254.72 --> 1262.0
happening live even

1257.679 --> 1264.5590000000002
so ah

1262.0 --> 1266.64
but yeah that movie might be worthwhile

1264.559 --> 1269.28
watching

1266.64 --> 1269.2800000000002
shadowgate

1272.08 --> 1278.48
maybe i'll just put the link of the

1275.36 --> 1282.1589999999999
natural news article

1278.48 --> 1282.159
i have to find it back first

1282.32 --> 1286.96
right there it is i'll put that out in

1286.08 --> 1290.29
chat

1286.96 --> 1293.44
because the video is on there

1290.29 --> 1293.44
[Music]

1299.6 --> 1319.4199999999998
if you want to check it out

1305.28 --> 1322.509
ah right

1319.42 --> 1322.509
[Music]

1324.799 --> 1333.84
so anything else guys

1345.12 --> 1349.52
arween versus neil degrasse tyson

1351.84 --> 1358.08
i think yeah well that could be very

1355.44 --> 1361.2
interesting of course

1358.08 --> 1365.039
but also because i probably would

1361.2 --> 1367.44
kind of be in the want to spare him

1365.039 --> 1368.1589999999999
you know i'm not like nathan thompson or

1367.44 --> 1370.4
anyone

1368.159 --> 1372.0
who just like or nathan oakley that is

1370.4 --> 1374.4
just going to

1372.0 --> 1376.48
get to the point and pretty much attack

1374.4 --> 1378.72
no i would kind of

1376.48 --> 1379.52
do it more in the dispersed chemo way

1378.72 --> 1382.4
but less

1379.52 --> 1383.2
thick on top as yeah you know he's

1382.4 --> 1387.2
always so

1383.2 --> 1389.76
upfront about that and kind of just

1387.2 --> 1391.76
sketch out the situation like where am i

1389.76 --> 1395.919
at where is neil at

1391.76 --> 1399.039
where i think he is at and then yeah

1395.919 --> 1402.48
talk about the dilemmas and like even

1399.039 --> 1404.4
i would even like think it might be

1402.48 --> 1406.08
interesting to just talk with him if

1404.4 --> 1408.64
he'd go for it like

1406.08 --> 1409.36
why do you think flat earth why do you

1408.64 --> 1412.4
think it's

1409.36 --> 1415.52
it's growing so much what is that from

1412.4 --> 1417.52
yeah because see it he probably has been

1415.52 --> 1418.559
asked some of these questions before by

1417.52 --> 1421.039
interviewers

1418.559 --> 1422.08
because he does to go around a lot i

1421.039 --> 1425.52
think

1422.08 --> 1428.08
but if i'd ask it

1425.52 --> 1430.24
i'd be a little bit more inquisitive but

1428.08 --> 1432.24
still subtle enough that he he'd not

1430.24 --> 1435.279
just try to bolt out of the

1432.24 --> 1435.279
out of the interview

1435.84 --> 1440.0
it's not growing oh no sure it's not

1440.559 --> 1446.72
of course second attempt it's very

1443.6 --> 1446.7199999999998
wishful thinking of you

1447.84 --> 1451.52
yeah it is growing it's growing

1449.2 --> 1453.6000000000001
everywhere it's getting mentioned

1451.52 --> 1456.799
everywhere

1453.6 --> 1459.12
it's getting mentioned even by people

1456.799 --> 1461.12
that are bringing it up because they see

1459.12 --> 1464.1589999999999
it as a problem because it's

1461.12 --> 1465.52
being so predominant like this is

1464.159 --> 1467.679
becoming a problem

1465.52 --> 1468.8799999999999
yeah it's it's everywhere it's being

1467.679 --> 1471.52
mentioned

1468.88 --> 1472.1200000000001
everybody knows there is flat earthers

1471.52 --> 1476.6399999999999
out there

1472.12 --> 1480.3999999999999
everybody so yes it is

1476.64 --> 1483.039
hey and in a time where nobody trusts

1480.4 --> 1486.0800000000002
media regular mainstream media and even

1483.039 --> 1487.679
police situations and society anymore

1486.08 --> 1491.6789999999999
and they don't want to get caught up

1487.679 --> 1493.8400000000001
into ridiculous satanic marxism

1491.679 --> 1496.24
well flat earth does suddenly seem to

1493.84 --> 1498.32
become much more of an option because it

1496.24 --> 1501.52
is

1498.32 --> 1504.08
really back to basic and just rely on

1501.52 --> 1506.32
yourself and your own exploration

1504.08 --> 1509.12
and there is so many people out there

1506.32 --> 1511.36
you know many people that

1509.12 --> 1513.4399999999998
take that step like that are

1511.36 --> 1515.36
disillusioned by society and that kind

1513.44 --> 1517.8400000000001
of try out flat earth

1515.36 --> 1519.84
well when they're just honest about it

1517.84 --> 1521.84
they're not super defensive like ballers

1519.84 --> 1523.36
just trying to get some kind of mistake

1521.84 --> 1525.1999999999998
out of a flat earther

1523.36 --> 1527.279
we notice that all of us most flat

1525.2 --> 1529.8400000000001
earthers notice that sometimes sweaters

1527.279 --> 1531.039
can be a bit ptsd and just start

1529.84 --> 1531.9189999999999
attacking because they think it's a

1531.039 --> 1535.12
baller

1531.919 --> 1537.5200000000002
but most veteran flat earthers they

1535.12 --> 1539.6789999999999
recognize this immediately and we

1537.52 --> 1542.0
embrace people without trying to

1539.679 --> 1545.039
manipulate them too much

1542.0 --> 1547.84
because it is tough and

1545.039 --> 1548.559
everybody that tries that out notices

1547.84 --> 1552.08
that

1548.559 --> 1552.08
like this is so different

1552.32 --> 1556.96
and that's very welcoming so yes flat

1555.039 --> 1559.44
earth i think it's

1556.96 --> 1561.8400000000001
exploding there's it's always going to

1559.44 --> 1564.0
be more flat earthers covertly that are

1561.84 --> 1564.8799999999999
not going to basically openly show their

1564.0 --> 1568.559
face and

1564.88 --> 1570.7990000000002
on the streets represent flat earth

1568.559 --> 1572.08
but there's going to be many more people

1570.799 --> 1574.24
that are just

1572.08 --> 1575.76
tapping into that because they know yeah

1574.24 --> 1578.88
this society is [ __ ]

1575.76 --> 1580.8799999999999
i must try this because it

1578.88 --> 1583.8400000000001
people are much more energetic there's

1580.88 --> 1588.0800000000002
more hope there is more

1583.84 --> 1591.12
new grounds you know most people i think

1588.08 --> 1593.6789999999999
don't even really care about

1591.12 --> 1594.4799999999998
really the outer space ideas or whether

1593.679 --> 1598.0
it's flat

1594.48 --> 1601.3600000000001
it's just they just want to live

1598.0 --> 1603.279
they just want a place where people live

1601.36 --> 1604.559
well and aren't good to one another and

1603.279 --> 1612.08
they're just

1604.559 --> 1615.12
obsessed with money and status and [ __ ]

1612.08 --> 1618.8799999999999
they want to be free really free not

1615.12 --> 1622.3999999999999
told what free is and then do that

1618.88 --> 1622.4
they want to get the real thing

1624.159 --> 1627.6000000000001
but yeah it takes a lot for a lot of

1626.88 --> 1630.64
people

1627.6 --> 1632.48
to get to that point and right now it's

1630.64 --> 1634.72
just the biggest pressure there's ever

1632.48 --> 1634.72
been

1635.84 --> 1640.1589999999999
because yeah through mainstream and

1638.88 --> 1642.96
politics

1640.159 --> 1644.48
the regular people are being almost

1642.96 --> 1648.48
openly

1644.48 --> 1650.48
or just openly psychologically attacked

1648.48 --> 1652.0
and yeah that's something that's never

1650.48 --> 1653.44
really happened like that before it's

1652.0 --> 1656.24
very distressing

1653.44 --> 1656.799
unnerving and destabilizing and so a lot

1656.24 --> 1660.08
of people

1656.799 --> 1662.8799999999999
will wake up and then start

1660.08 --> 1664.32
finding better grounds wherever it may

1662.88 --> 1666.0
be

1664.32 --> 1667.76
and if they find the same corruption

1666.0 --> 1669.12
everywhere then they're not gonna stick

1667.76 --> 1670.72
there

1669.12 --> 1672.2399999999998
because that was specifically what they

1670.72 --> 1674.88
were trying to get away from not

1672.24 --> 1677.279
just abandon that and try it again in

1674.88 --> 1682.7990000000002
the same way somewhere else

1677.279 --> 1685.2
no most people don't do that

1682.799 --> 1689.039
they want new grounds they want they

1685.2 --> 1689.039
want to get rid of the old [ __ ]

1690.0 --> 1696.399
like the systemic problems that are

1693.12 --> 1698.08
appearing that are being now enforced

1696.399 --> 1699.9189999999999
the problems their problems they're

1698.08 --> 1701.6
being enforced they're being forced upon

1699.919 --> 1703.76
everyone and everyone wants to escape

1701.6 --> 1705.9189999999999
from that how do you do that

1703.76 --> 1707.679
by basically retracting well what is a

1705.919 --> 1711.1200000000001
good way to retract

1707.679 --> 1714.24
well flat earth because flat earth seems

1711.12 --> 1715.1999999999998
in a public opinion to be encounter

1714.24 --> 1718.0
opposite of

1715.2 --> 1718.0
society

1722.24 --> 1725.52
it's not though it's not

1723.279 --> 1727.2
counter-opposite of society it's just

1725.52 --> 1731.2
counter-opposite of the

1727.2 --> 1733.8400000000001
top-down control mechanisms

1731.2 --> 1735.039
and the input the propaganda that comes

1733.84 --> 1737.9189999999999
top down

1735.039 --> 1739.039
within society that part is what we

1737.919 --> 1742.96
oppose

1739.039 --> 1746.72
not the people it's the people that

1742.96 --> 1753.8400000000001
reinforce those mistakes and those

1746.72 --> 1753.84
yeah those bad things anyway

1765.76 --> 1769.6
yeah yeah style in 80 12 definitely

1768.559 --> 1771.84
reasons for that

1769.6 --> 1772.799
mainly that it is flat that's the

1771.84 --> 1781.84
reasons why it

1772.799 --> 1781.84
looks so flat

1797.279 --> 1805.6
theorize well you can't bend the horizon

1803.12 --> 1806.8799999999999
you know terrestrial refraction suggests

1805.6 --> 1810.48
that the horizon

1806.88 --> 1811.7600000000002
is being loomed or displaced in relation

1810.48 --> 1813.919
to the supposed

1811.76 --> 1816.72
presupposed real horizon which would be

1813.919 --> 1820.48
the geometrical horizon

1816.72 --> 1823.3600000000001
the thing is though there is no effect

1820.48 --> 1824.559
ever discovered in nature or established

1823.36 --> 1828.08
through optics

1824.559 --> 1831.44
research that the horizon can ever be

1828.08 --> 1834.72
displaced in relation to

1831.44 --> 1836.64
itself to a physical horizon that

1834.72 --> 1838.799
that doesn't happen it never happens

1836.64 --> 1841.6000000000001
it's always the objects

1838.799 --> 1842.6399999999999
surrounding the horizon the effective

1841.6 --> 1845.84
horizon the

1842.64 --> 1848.8400000000001
real horizon that are

1845.84 --> 1851.039
this place the horizon itself does not

1848.84 --> 1854.32
displace

1851.039 --> 1855.12
it may appear at different apparent

1854.32 --> 1857.519
heights

1855.12 --> 1859.12
or closer by that kind of thing because

1857.519 --> 1862.559
yeah closer by will

1859.12 --> 1865.84
mean apparently lower as well

1862.559 --> 1865.84
you know because of perspective

1866.799 --> 1871.279
but the actual height of the horizon can

1869.84 --> 1873.6
never be visually

1871.279 --> 1874.96
displaced in relation well to itself

1873.6 --> 1878.08
that doesn't happen

1874.96 --> 1880.799
that's not that's never been registered

1878.08 --> 1883.6
within optics it's an impossibility only

1880.799 --> 1883.6
objects

1885.039 --> 1889.039
can actually be displaced in relation to

1888.48 --> 1892.0
the

1889.039 --> 1892.799
visual horizon to the actual horizon not

1892.0 --> 1896.0
the horizon

1892.799 --> 1898.6399999999999
itself it does not displace it may

1896.0 --> 1900.48
appear to migrate further into the

1898.64 --> 1902.48
distance or closer by

1900.48 --> 1904.72
due to the limit of sight with

1902.48 --> 1907.44
refraction

1904.72 --> 1908.24
and that's the optical slant effect you

1907.44 --> 1910.0800000000002
know i just

1908.24 --> 1912.64
showed it with the eyeball on the stick

1910.08 --> 1912.6399999999999
many times

1917.679 --> 1921.44
so yeah terrestrial refraction it's it's

1920.64 --> 1924.5590000000002
a myth

1921.44 --> 1925.039
optics doesn't work that way you know it

1924.559 --> 1928.08
may

1925.039 --> 1931.2
be very easy to apply in math

1928.08 --> 1932.8799999999999
or it's not really it's rather a back

1931.2 --> 1935.2
engineering strategy because

1932.88 --> 1937.519
there isn't even a singular formula for

1935.2 --> 1940.48
this terrestrial refraction

1937.519 --> 1942.159
except that it has r in it that's like

1940.48 --> 1943.519
the only thing that's been really

1942.159 --> 1946.3200000000002
established about it

1943.519 --> 1946.96
there's no real solid formula for it

1946.32 --> 1950.6399999999999
because

1946.96 --> 1950.64
it's a back engineering trick

1952.0 --> 1956.159
it always has been it's always taking

1955.36 --> 1959.36
the flat

1956.159 --> 1961.3600000000001
side the actual flat side the limited

1959.36 --> 1964.9599999999998
view and all that

1961.36 --> 1968.32
and then turn it

1964.96 --> 1972.32
into something else turn it into

1968.32 --> 1975.36
yeah try to justify why it's not

1972.32 --> 1977.2
exactly in the geometrically assumed

1975.36 --> 1980.32
position that it should be

1977.2 --> 1982.559
and that is terrestrial refraction it's

1980.32 --> 1986.399
a giant machination it's an excuse

1982.559 --> 1991.84
and it's not based in empirical evidence

1986.399 --> 1991.84
and research within optics so

2017.679 --> 2021.1200000000001
few people notice that it doesn't work

2020.08 --> 2022.799
on a ball

2021.12 --> 2024.2399999999998
well that's because they've been told

2022.799 --> 2026.6399999999999
that it always looks flat

2024.24 --> 2026.64
remember

2030.399 --> 2034.32
like you can't see the curvature on the

2033.279 --> 2038.559
beach ball

2034.32 --> 2038.559
remember that stuff is flat

2038.64 --> 2042.5590000000002
they're basically being told by the one

2040.88 --> 2044.48
of the high priests

2042.559 --> 2046.1589999999999
you can't see the curvature you could

2044.48 --> 2048.639
never see this curvature unless you're

2046.159 --> 2050.96
in a spaceship or something

2048.639 --> 2052.2400000000002
because it always looks flat doesn't

2050.96 --> 2054.96
give a reason

2052.24 --> 2057.7599999999998
for that i don't think he even mentions

2054.96 --> 2059.28
terrestrial refraction or refraction

2057.76 --> 2060.8
without the terrestrial because that's

2059.28 --> 2064.7200000000003
what they would mean

2060.8 --> 2066.7200000000003
but it is implied

2064.72 --> 2067.839
it's just not really it's just said no

2066.72 --> 2070.1589999999997
you don't see it so

2067.839 --> 2071.52
people will then be like okay well if

2070.159 --> 2074.0
you don't see it then i'm not

2071.52 --> 2076.399
just not gonna think about it why would

2074.0 --> 2078.079
you consider what you're seeing

2076.399 --> 2080.0789999999997
if you're already been told that you

2078.079 --> 2080.96
can't see the curvature anyway so you're

2080.079 --> 2083.76
just gonna see

2080.96 --> 2086.079
weird other things perhaps it might look

2083.76 --> 2086.079
flat

2086.839 --> 2093.04
see most of the

2089.76 --> 2094.32
baller religion priest top down directed

2093.04 --> 2098.48
towards the normies

2094.32 --> 2100.96
is really all about discouraging

2098.48 --> 2102.2400000000002
it's discouraging them to explore

2100.96 --> 2104.4
because it's useless

2102.24 --> 2106.16
it's like too tough it's all presented

2104.4 --> 2107.6800000000003
as such it's like no it's too tough to

2106.16 --> 2109.92
get proof for this

2107.68 --> 2111.7599999999998
you have to be a rocket scientist or a

2109.92 --> 2114.56
super mathematician and then you can

2111.76 --> 2117.0400000000004
calculate it and people are like uh

2114.56 --> 2118.16
okay well if i can't just test it out

2117.04 --> 2122.0
myself out there

2118.16 --> 2122.0
then i'll just not bother with it

2122.32 --> 2126.48
i think that's really why that is there

2127.2 --> 2133.2799999999997
no it's for the normies not

2130.4 --> 2135.119
for the globe or technicals they don't

2133.28 --> 2136.6400000000003
care about them they often even say like

2135.119 --> 2138.7200000000003
no we don't give a [ __ ] about neil

2136.64 --> 2140.0
degrasse tyson or nasa

2138.72 --> 2141.7599999999998
we don't care about what they say

2140.0 --> 2142.96
they're buffoons they got it all wrong

2141.76 --> 2146.32
or

2142.96 --> 2148.4
they're just stupid or they're liars and

2146.32 --> 2153.3590000000004
they're trying to ruin it for us or

2148.4 --> 2156.96
i don't know but the normies don't

2153.359 --> 2173.839
figure that out see

2156.96 --> 2173.839
they're just taking it superficially

2177.2 --> 2187.839
right so anything else

2203.52 --> 2214.48
yeah spinning a water ball sounds very

2205.68 --> 2216.3199999999997
refreshing when it's this hot

2214.48 --> 2218.16
but now i'm talking about actual water

2216.32 --> 2229.839
bowl so you know what happens the water

2218.16 --> 2229.839
flies right off it

2241.52 --> 2247.28
in rover pictures of mars people

2243.76 --> 2249.92
recently spotted aztec pyramids

2247.28 --> 2249.92
of course

2250.4 --> 2254.1600000000003
right well that's not really that much

2253.839 --> 2256.7999999999997
of

2254.16 --> 2260.3999999999996
that's not really that newsworthy martin

2256.8 --> 2263.2000000000003
tolbert that shit's been going down even

2260.4 --> 2264.8
like since the 90s remember the face on

2263.2 --> 2270.48
mars

2264.8 --> 2272.6400000000003
and like i remembered a computer game

2270.48 --> 2274.8
like cos called zach mccracken very

2272.64 --> 2278.0789999999997
early adventure game that i played on my

2274.8 --> 2283.28
commodore 64. on floppy disks

2278.079 --> 2286.7200000000003
but it also like had events on mars

2283.28 --> 2288.5600000000004
and there were like aliens and and giant

2286.72 --> 2291.5989999999997
pyramidal structures like

2288.56 --> 2293.839
egyptian style though mostly it was

2291.599 --> 2294.96
very fascinating for me to play at the

2293.839 --> 2298.4
time

2294.96 --> 2299.68
but that was early 90s so a computer

2298.4 --> 2303.52
game

2299.68 --> 2305.68
you know those ideas have always been

2303.52 --> 2305.68
there

2308.64 --> 2312.0
i don't know i think probably at some

2311.52 --> 2315.04
point they

2312.0 --> 2315.04
want to suggest

2315.2 --> 2320.8799999999997
within the alien creators idea

2318.8 --> 2322.6400000000003
and at ancient atlantis that at some

2320.88 --> 2324.0
point they probably want everyone to

2322.64 --> 2326.7999999999997
believe that

2324.0 --> 2329.119
the atlantean times or that empire times

2326.8 --> 2332.7200000000003
that it was interplanetary

2329.119 --> 2335.92
and that we had colonies on mars and

2332.72 --> 2337.9199999999996
and who knows where else you know

2335.92 --> 2339.119
they probably want us to believe that

2337.92 --> 2342.48
and that then it

2339.119 --> 2345.119
dude disaster happened and yeah

2342.48 --> 2346.8
it's everybody on mars died or it lost

2345.119 --> 2348.48
its atmosphere you know how that goes

2346.8 --> 2351.119
with storytelling

2348.48 --> 2352.079
but i bet you they want to go there

2351.119 --> 2355.359
because i guess

2352.079 --> 2358.48
it would make a pretty good story

2355.359 --> 2361.119
like almost historical and with planets

2358.48 --> 2361.119
in nonsense

2365.599 --> 2369.839
underwater pyramids yeah

2380.839 --> 2383.839
plenty

2385.76 --> 2389.44
i'm gonna dig into this tangerine

2393.28 --> 2397.28
right nearly everywhere well that's why

2396.16 --> 2400.72
i think

2397.28 --> 2400.7200000000003
that pyramids were actually

2402.0 --> 2410.24
uh yeah electro hydroelectric

2406.88 --> 2412.7200000000003
devices that pumped energy in the air

2410.24 --> 2413.5989999999997
in order for certain technologies to

2412.72 --> 2416.7999999999997
work and

2413.599 --> 2419.52
even biotechnology

2416.8 --> 2422.0
sort of that it would feed giants that

2419.52 --> 2424.16
it would allow them to basically

2422.0 --> 2427.28
persist without just engorging

2424.16 --> 2430.96
themselves constantly

2427.28 --> 2433.119
and starving because being huge

2430.96 --> 2434.96
is not very good on the metabolism

2433.119 --> 2437.28
unless you have like

2434.96 --> 2438.079
prana type feeding unless there's like

2437.28 --> 2440.5600000000004
electrical

2438.079 --> 2442.079
feeding happening and i think that the

2440.56 --> 2444.319
giants

2442.079 --> 2445.92
might have had that ability to sustain

2444.319 --> 2447.2799999999997
themselves like that

2445.92 --> 2449.2000000000003
and that that is the reason why the

2447.28 --> 2450.4
pyramids were there and that giants

2449.2 --> 2453.52
themselves also

2450.4 --> 2456.96
helped in the construction of them

2453.52 --> 2458.0
the transport that is why it went so

2456.96 --> 2459.839
quickly

2458.0 --> 2461.76
of course also because of the stone

2459.839 --> 2464.0789999999997
molding techniques

2461.76 --> 2467.8390000000004
like turning it into clay and then back

2464.079 --> 2467.8390000000004
into stone

2469.76 --> 2475.0400000000004
so yeah that's my theory about it and

2472.4 --> 2478.0
it's all on earth

2475.04 --> 2479.92
it's all within this realm and who knows

2478.0 --> 2482.0
if it even reached in the bordering

2479.92 --> 2485.119
realms

2482.0 --> 2487.2
who knows you know maybe at some point

2485.119 --> 2490.319
if we get if we really do get an

2487.2 --> 2492.839
opportunity to basically get to see

2490.319 --> 2494.16
the realms beyond their own within our

2492.839 --> 2499.2799999999997
lifetime

2494.16 --> 2502.0789999999997
we might just find more pyramids there

2499.28 --> 2503.6800000000003
and yeah a lot of nature kind of the

2502.079 --> 2506.96
idea

2503.68 --> 2508.0789999999997
of what we found in south america or

2506.96 --> 2511.2
what is set that

2508.079 --> 2512.5600000000004
was found like jungle with those

2511.2 --> 2515.68
pyramids in there

2512.56 --> 2518.7999999999997
that might be there too you know in the

2515.68 --> 2521.44
beyond the south pole region or the

2518.8 --> 2523.599
yeah the whatever region there still may

2521.44 --> 2526.56
be

2523.599 --> 2526.56
in the far north

2531.52 --> 2537.92
stone softening with acids no no no no

2534.88 --> 2539.839
i don't think so no no that wouldn't

2537.92 --> 2541.92
work

2539.839 --> 2543.92
you can't soften it all up that actually

2541.92 --> 2545.44
that's that's a that causes a chemical

2543.92 --> 2547.2000000000003
reaction

2545.44 --> 2549.839
you can't reverse that i'm pretty sure

2547.2 --> 2552.8799999999997
they used

2549.839 --> 2553.359
kind of sauna cymatics electrostatics

2552.88 --> 2557.28
thing

2553.359 --> 2557.2799999999997
you know it's even been speculated about

2557.599 --> 2565.839
about the horns remember

2568.079 --> 2579.8390000000004
what are you talking about good servant

2582.65 --> 2585.8
[Music]

2590.839 --> 2593.839
hmm

2596.56 --> 2601.44
old stones and how they were made right

2599.599 --> 2605.44
i think but i think that

2601.44 --> 2608.16
i have seen a lot of post atlantean

2605.44 --> 2610.079
early industry which is basically after

2608.16 --> 2612.319
atlantis fell

2610.079 --> 2613.8390000000004
what people still manage to gather

2612.319 --> 2616.88
together

2613.839 --> 2619.04
from what was left so those a lot of

2616.88 --> 2620.8
those ancient techniques like even sonic

2619.04 --> 2622.319
drilling and all that where you just use

2620.8 --> 2626.2400000000002
the

2622.319 --> 2626.24
smart very smart techniques

2627.28 --> 2630.7200000000003
like also stone breaking through ice and

2629.68 --> 2632.48
with the sonic

2630.72 --> 2634.3999999999996
all these things yeah those were

2632.48 --> 2637.04
invented very early but it was post

2634.4 --> 2638.56
atlantis because i think that

2637.04 --> 2641.04
the preponderance of all these

2638.56 --> 2642.88
megalithic structures

2641.04 --> 2646.64
that definitely wasn't built through

2642.88 --> 2649.2000000000003
these post-atlantean techniques

2646.64 --> 2651.2
you know although stone levitation might

2649.2 --> 2652.4399999999996
have simply been an atlantean era

2651.2 --> 2655.4399999999996
technique that was

2652.44 --> 2655.44
rediscovered

2655.839 --> 2659.2
like somebody that had the understanding

2658.88 --> 2663.28
of

2659.2 --> 2664.319
i don't know wizardry ancient cymatics

2663.28 --> 2666.88
and all that

2664.319 --> 2669.2
an apprentice somebody a builder might

2666.88 --> 2672.2400000000002
have survived and then

2669.2 --> 2673.2799999999997
just sporadically tried to build

2672.24 --> 2674.839
something here and there

2673.28 --> 2676.88
you know that may have definitely

2674.839 --> 2681.92
happened but not

2676.88 --> 2681.92
the majority of it pretty sure that

2684.0 --> 2691.839
that was before the flood

2697.359 --> 2703.5989999999997
are two drills well mystical

2700.8 --> 2704.96
those two drills i've watches even in

2703.599 --> 2706.88
the pyramid code

2704.96 --> 2709.76
which is partially a source of

2706.88 --> 2713.28
inspiration for my conception of this

2709.76 --> 2716.3190000000004
atlantic era they show

2713.28 --> 2720.0
that exactly that this the perfect

2716.319 --> 2720.96
drill holes well the maker of the

2720.0 --> 2724.16
documentary

2720.96 --> 2724.8
at least said that they figured out it

2724.16 --> 2727.92
was

2724.8 --> 2731.599
sonic drilling they basically used

2727.92 --> 2734.56
cymatics to get a perfect

2731.599 --> 2735.3590000000004
resonation with whatever they were using

2734.56 --> 2738.4
a rod is

2735.359 --> 2741.92
maybe a copper rod or something or

2738.4 --> 2742.8
steel i don't know and then used it to

2741.92 --> 2745.2000000000003
just

2742.8 --> 2746.88
let it naturally drill through it

2745.2 --> 2749.2799999999997
probably took quite a long time to do

2746.88 --> 2749.28
that too

2750.16 --> 2757.68
but they would basically be a using

2754.319 --> 2760.96
uh non-engine driven devices

2757.68 --> 2762.7999999999997
that all use natural cymatics and

2760.96 --> 2765.2
cycles you know just like the

2762.8 --> 2768.319
hydrostatic pumps

2765.2 --> 2771.04
that are just around the pyramids too

2768.319 --> 2771.92
like these devices if water was flowing

2771.04 --> 2774.88
in

2771.92 --> 2776.7200000000003
then automatic pumping would start to

2774.88 --> 2779.28
happen

2776.72 --> 2780.8799999999997
and that's exactly the atlantean

2779.28 --> 2783.92
technology it was all

2780.88 --> 2784.96
self-creating basically it did it would

2783.92 --> 2788.079
just keep going

2784.96 --> 2790.16
always it was fully automated without

2788.079 --> 2791.52
technology that had to be maintained as

2790.16 --> 2803.839
long as things didn't just

2791.52 --> 2803.839
completely shatter it would keep going

2813.28 --> 2818.7200000000003
welt plastics sonic vibration okay

2819.839 --> 2823.7599999999998
that must be friction melting then

2826.8 --> 2831.8390000000004
because you know vibration also causes

2829.04 --> 2831.839
heat

2832.24 --> 2835.1189999999997
if it's extreme

2835.52 --> 2838.72
because yeah that's what presumed heat

2837.68 --> 2840.8799999999997
even is it's the

2838.72 --> 2845.839
rapid shaking of the molecules remember

2840.88 --> 2847.76
that's what i was taught in school

2845.839 --> 2849.68
but friction definitely does cut it

2847.76 --> 2854.4
cause heat so

2849.68 --> 2854.3999999999996
maybe that's how they do it with plastic

2856.839 --> 2859.839
interesting

2870.839 --> 2873.839
hmm

2880.8 --> 2884.8
oh they're having a party outside

2884.96 --> 2889.68
i thank you good servant for the 99 cent

2887.359 --> 2894.24
super chat donation

2889.68 --> 2894.24
very enthusiastic looking smiley

2897.68 --> 2901.839
i always light a particle it's not

2904.24 --> 2910.0
but you can think of it as a particle

2907.28 --> 2911.599
you could probably use calculations that

2910.0 --> 2912.8
assume it is a particle and it would

2911.599 --> 2915.839
work out

2912.8 --> 2915.8390000000004
but it's not

2917.44 --> 2920.88
because a particle suggests

2922.24 --> 2929.5989999999997
a primary unit a minimum sized unit

2925.599 --> 2932.8
and it is not that

2929.599 --> 2936.079
i explained that many times before

2932.8 --> 2936.96
it's a b maybe it i you know beam is

2936.079 --> 2940.4
another way to

2936.96 --> 2942.7200000000003
visualize it technically

2940.4 --> 2944.88
it's not even that important the whole

2942.72 --> 2946.64
the whole cornerstone of my argument as

2944.88 --> 2949.04
to white light is not a particle is

2946.64 --> 2953.359
because particles

2949.04 --> 2957.839
basically by their conceptual nature

2953.359 --> 2957.839
demand a minimum unit

2959.2 --> 2962.96
now is it infinitely divisible beam if

2962.4 --> 2965.52
it was

2962.96 --> 2967.119
indivisible beam then it it might have

2965.52 --> 2970.0
just as well be a particle

2967.119 --> 2970.8
now it's infinitely divisible so that's

2970.0 --> 2974.0
the difference

2970.8 --> 2977.28
it can split apart indefinitely at

2974.0 --> 2979.359
some point though if it is split apart

2977.28 --> 2983.119
up beyond a certain threshold then

2979.359 --> 2986.64
materials will no longer be able to

2983.119 --> 2990.7200000000003
absorb enough of it in order to register

2986.64 --> 2990.72
that it is interacting with it

2996.839 --> 2999.839
right

3008.01 --> 3013.8390000000004
[Music]

3010.839 --> 3013.839
hmm

3025.52 --> 3032.88
right but it might just as well

3028.72 --> 3036.64
be considered an infinitely

3032.88 --> 3040.319
divisible blob of energy you know

3036.64 --> 3042.24
the beam for me is just yeah because

3040.319 --> 3043.359
it doesn't really matter anymore but it

3042.24 --> 3046.0789999999997
will assist

3043.359 --> 3046.72
in trying to figure out what it does

3046.079 --> 3049.28
it's just

3046.72 --> 3051.2799999999997
for the visualization because it might

3049.28 --> 3055.8390000000004
just as well be a little blob of energy

3051.28 --> 3055.8390000000004
that just goes so incredibly fast

3057.04 --> 3066.48
but light just it does split up like

3061.52 --> 3069.92
laser splits up you know how that works

3066.48 --> 3072.88
over the pond lasers they split up

3069.92 --> 3074.079
so oh were they all just stacked

3072.88 --> 3076.8
together

3074.079 --> 3077.44
particles and they're just going apart

3076.8 --> 3083.76
like that

3077.44 --> 3086.0
really is that it um

3083.76 --> 3088.1600000000003
i don't know if they were simply

3086.0 --> 3091.28
infinitely divisible

3088.16 --> 3094.48
beams going directed to

3091.28 --> 3097.76
this rough one direction and then

3094.48 --> 3101.52
refraction would simply automatically

3097.76 --> 3104.559
make them waver split apart

3101.52 --> 3106.72
or particles don't really like

3104.559 --> 3110.4
that idea of splitting apart they don't

3106.72 --> 3112.72
evenly split apart like that overall

3110.4 --> 3113.76
you know especially on a very long

3112.72 --> 3115.9199999999996
distance

3113.76 --> 3117.44
but light doesn't really have a problem

3115.92 --> 3121.04
with it it will just

3117.44 --> 3123.599
wave out just like that it will split up

3121.04 --> 3126.4
you even call it splitting up the amount

3123.599 --> 3129.28
of light intensity over

3126.4 --> 3130.7200000000003
over distance and like over how big it

3129.28 --> 3133.2000000000003
becomes it does become

3130.72 --> 3135.4399999999996
less but it's not like oh it suddenly

3133.2 --> 3137.4399999999996
gets holes in there or something

3135.44 --> 3139.119
no no no no that would be typically

3137.44 --> 3141.2000000000003
particle

3139.119 --> 3143.359
because the particle has to have an

3141.2 --> 3144.48
individual trajectory over that all that

3143.359 --> 3153.839
distance

3144.48 --> 3153.839
no no i don't think so

3159.2 --> 3165.04
right but as long as

3162.24 --> 3167.0699999999997
it's cleared up that my stance is not

3165.04 --> 3170.109
that light is a wave

3167.07 --> 3170.1090000000004
[Music]

3171.44 --> 3177.28
it may show wave-like attributes

3175.359 --> 3180.72
but it is in itself not a wave because

3177.28 --> 3185.2000000000003
it's a separate thing

3180.72 --> 3189.359
there's no medium for it required

3185.2 --> 3191.7599999999998
other than just the air

3189.359 --> 3194.319
and transparent things for it to travel

3191.76 --> 3195.92
through before it is absorbed because it

3194.319 --> 3199.04
always is in the end

3195.92 --> 3203.28
absorbed by the matter

3199.04 --> 3205.119
so the matter is the medium of light

3203.28 --> 3208.6400000000003
there's no other medium required like

3205.119 --> 3212.2400000000002
ether that kind of nonsense

3208.64 --> 3215.92
and yeah it's not a particle so that

3212.24 --> 3216.8799999999997
tells you also if you don't regard it as

3215.92 --> 3219.839
a particle that

3216.88 --> 3221.599
gets a lot of issues out of the way

3219.839 --> 3222.0789999999997
because you don't have to equate it with

3221.599 --> 3226.559
typical

3222.079 --> 3226.559
particle behavior which it does not show

3232.559 --> 3238.3190000000004
it's something else

3236.4 --> 3241.359
you know and hey if it is really

3238.319 --> 3243.359
something else if it just shows like woo

3241.359 --> 3245.2799999999997
it almost looks like a wave it has wave

3243.359 --> 3248.24
like things and

3245.28 --> 3249.2000000000003
and it's not really well yeah calling it

3248.24 --> 3254.0
a beam

3249.2 --> 3254.0
could very easily be the third pillar

3254.24 --> 3260.64
waves particles beams

3257.599 --> 3261.6800000000003
and then it is kind of like if you build

3260.64 --> 3264.24
it up that big

3261.68 --> 3265.04
as a third thing then it really shows

3264.24 --> 3267.68
like this is

3265.04 --> 3270.16
really a different thing than those

3267.68 --> 3270.16
other two

3270.48 --> 3274.559
see and i think it is

3274.96 --> 3281.04
[Music]

3276.48 --> 3281.04
doesn't mean that it is literally a beam

3281.28 --> 3289.76
it's just energy mostly but it does

3285.599 --> 3292.96
behave should reveal itself as a beam

3289.76 --> 3296.2400000000002
in ways normally

3292.96 --> 3298.4
if it's obstructed shadows

3296.24 --> 3300.0
things in the way a whole yeah it's

3298.4 --> 3303.76
still a beam

3300.0 --> 3307.839
from the point of spawning

3303.76 --> 3307.8390000000004
of the light of the origin

3308.88 --> 3314.0
naturally behaves like a beam if the

3312.079 --> 3315.3590000000004
surrounding if the atmosphere it is

3314.0 --> 3318.839
going through or

3315.359 --> 3321.839
the medium it's going through is

3318.839 --> 3321.839
homogeneous

3332.839 --> 3337.359
so

3334.079 --> 3337.3590000000004
don't don't do that

3341.76 --> 3349.8390000000004
that's not a good entrance buddy

3351.04 --> 3355.68
if you say anything but that i would

3353.52 --> 3356.16
just say hello welcome back but if you

3355.68 --> 3363.839
gonna

3356.16 --> 3363.839
start out like that no no

3374.839 --> 3379.52
hmm

3377.2 --> 3379.52
uh

3383.2 --> 3386.799
right so anything else

3389.119 --> 3392.4
let's not talk about food because i

3390.96 --> 3395.28
haven't launched yet

3392.4 --> 3395.28
i'm kind of hungry

3397.839 --> 3405.839
but that does sound nice again

3408.079 --> 3410.799
oh dear

3414.72 --> 3419.839
yeah that's okay

3424.88 --> 3431.04
but i shouldn't complain you know i had

3427.92 --> 3434.64
uh spaghetti for half a week

3431.04 --> 3434.64
that was really good as well

3441.44 --> 3445.119
yeah but i don't have a proper oven and

3443.92 --> 3446.96
for like

3445.119 --> 3450.079
meals like that you need like a real

3446.96 --> 3450.079
oven and not just a

3450.559 --> 3455.76
air air blowing oven anyway

3456.319 --> 3462.6
i really want one

3460.0 --> 3465.28
they are expensive

3462.6 --> 3468.0
[Music]

3465.28 --> 3468.0
to get a good one

3469.44 --> 3475.359
uh yeah i'm gonna say get a second hand

3472.48 --> 3476.88
i'm gonna need transport too but anyway

3475.359 --> 3479.359
it doesn't look like we're gonna have an

3476.88 --> 3489.839
oven anytime soon

3479.359 --> 3489.839
although i'd really like one

3493.76 --> 3503.8390000000004
slow cooker i don't know what that is

3511.39 --> 3517.839
[Music]

3512.559 --> 3517.8390000000004
dammit now you got me talking about food

3518.11 --> 3521.7090000000003
[Music]

3533.119 --> 3541.2000000000003
yeah maybe

3536.4 --> 3541.2000000000003
i i always avoided that sort of

3542.839 --> 3545.839
thing

3549.2 --> 3552.96
i've always been about pots and pans and

3551.92 --> 3559.839
gas

3552.96 --> 3559.839
gas cooking

3570.839 --> 3575.04
hmm it fit a pizza though you know

3573.68 --> 3587.839
that's one of the primary

3575.04 --> 3587.839
reasons i want an oven bag

3598.839 --> 3601.839
so

3606.559 --> 3612.2400000000002
anyway look if somebody thinks i really

3610.559 --> 3614.079
should get one of these then you can

3612.24 --> 3617.2
donate to my paypal for that

3614.079 --> 3619.3590000000004
specifically if you wanted to

3617.2 --> 3621.52
but yeah i would never pick one of those

3619.359 --> 3625.04
devices

3621.52 --> 3625.839
like using my own budget because i

3625.04 --> 3629.599
already

3625.839 --> 3631.599
yeah besides not having a regular oven

3629.599 --> 3635.04
i pretty much have everything i need i

3631.599 --> 3643.44
can make plenty of things and it's good

3635.04 --> 3647.359
i like my dinners

3643.44 --> 3647.359
all right you can't fit a pizza yeah

3653.599 --> 3660.96
do like specific

3657.119 --> 3671.839
one pizza do slow cookers

3660.96 --> 3671.839
specifically made for pizzas exist

3673.52 --> 3678.4
oh okay they do

3682.839 --> 3687.2
huh

3684.319 --> 3687.2
that's interesting

3688.319 --> 3701.7599999999998
that's very interesting

3698.4 --> 3703.6800000000003
and they're like 40 50 euro there's some

3701.76 --> 3704.96
really expensive ones there as well but

3703.68 --> 3707.2799999999997
that's

3704.96 --> 3707.28
hmm

3711.44 --> 3715.52
pizza oven's pretty cheap basic first

3716.16 --> 3720.3999999999996
right well the other only other real

3718.96 --> 3723.76
reason why i would have it

3720.4 --> 3726.079
would be for lasagna but yeah lasagna

3723.76 --> 3727.76
has a lot of cheese in it

3726.079 --> 3730.48
i don't think i'm gonna be eating a lot

3727.76 --> 3730.48
of lasagna

3732.319 --> 3737.599
so i don't know this might actually

3734.4 --> 3737.599
solve my situation

3739.599 --> 3741.839
hmm

3744.079 --> 3750.0
lasagna in one two can you fit a lasagna

3747.28 --> 3750.0
in a pizza

3752.839 --> 3755.839
cooker

3767.599 --> 3769.839
okay

3787.359 --> 3792.24
i don't think the shape will work out

3792.319 --> 3797.359
anyway uh this is really making me

3794.4 --> 3797.359
hungry it

3798.64 --> 3803.2799999999997
yeah and the problem is also that these

3801.039 --> 3806.4
types of cookers

3803.28 --> 3810.1600000000003
they do tend to take up space

3806.4 --> 3814.319
you know we don't have a lot of space

3810.16 --> 3814.319
left in the kitchen

3817.76 --> 3821.5200000000004
ah but it's been it's been a long time

3820.0 --> 3824.96
since i had pizza man

3821.52 --> 3828.079
i do miss it and i do make a good pizza

3824.96 --> 3831.44
it's a spelt bottom

3828.079 --> 3833.599
fresh basil on there and

3831.44 --> 3839.839
and i do it with no cheese and salami

3833.599 --> 3839.839
these days

3840.96 --> 3844.64
george sanford well because it's not his

3842.72 --> 3848.16
stove

3844.64 --> 3851.0389999999998
he only has a

3848.16 --> 3852.0
a cooler one of the coolers the rest

3851.039 --> 3854.96
it's all

3852.0 --> 3856.24
well it's all my mine i got a freezer

3854.96 --> 3859.119
it's mine i got a

3856.24 --> 3859.7599999999998
washing machine that's mine i got a uh

3859.119 --> 3863.6800000000003
my own

3859.76 --> 3866.1600000000003
cooler which is just for me alone

3863.68 --> 3867.68
and yeah whatever the rest does they do

3866.16 --> 3869.839
it either in the other cooler

3867.68 --> 3871.0389999999998
from the landlord or somewhere else i

3869.839 --> 3872.319
don't know maybe they have their own

3871.039 --> 3875.039
coolers on their room they all have

3872.319 --> 3875.0389999999998
plenty of room

3879.039 --> 3885.92
but yeah the oven is basically whoever

3883.2 --> 3885.9199999999996
provides it

3886.4 --> 3892.0
so it's like a microwave oven but the

3890.4 --> 3894.079
oven part is broken

3892.0 --> 3895.2
but the microwave still working in

3894.079 --> 3897.6800000000003
plenty of people

3895.2 --> 3899.9199999999996
students that have no problem with

3897.68 --> 3902.319
eating microwave heated meals

3899.92 --> 3902.319

refrigerators and coolers are are

because they're not so they're yeah not

4200.719 --> 4203.84
that complicated

4205.76 --> 4210.56
but with like those microwave oven boxes

4208.64 --> 4214.320000000001
it's a different matter

4210.56 --> 4216.56
those are not so easily repaired

4214.32 --> 4219.679
and they're not that expensive per

4216.56 --> 4219.679
default anyway

4228.84 --> 4231.84

uh anyway i don't know what this is this

4559.52 --> 4567.84

have

4578.48 --> 4582.959999999999

4880.719 --> 4882.88
what they're into and all that and yeah

4882.4 --> 4884.5599999999995
i

4882.88 --> 4886.2390000000005
can't say that i find that very

4884.56 --> 4889.04
comfortable

4886.239 --> 4890.159
but they're not taking a percentage of

4889.04 --> 4894.08
the transfers

4890.159 --> 4896.799999999999
that happens here in the super chats

4894.08 --> 4896.8
it happens

4897.28 --> 4904.96
with patreon but paypal

4901.28 --> 4904.96
it as far as i know it doesn't

4909.92 --> 4914.0
or maybe if you send it to somebody that

4912.719 --> 4916.56
you have to

4914.0 --> 4917.679
add on a little i don't know i've never

4916.56 --> 4921.4400000000005
done that before

4917.679 --> 4921.4400000000005
i've only been on the receiving end so

4928.84 --> 4931.84
far

4944.48 --> 4949.678999999999
right but anyway hey if anybody wants me
