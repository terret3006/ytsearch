85.32 --> 87.79899999999999
right

91.2 --> 95.22
clouded

93.18 --> 97.7
there's a bit of wind but not as strong

95.22 --> 97.7
as yesterday

97.86 --> 101.72
it did by the way clear up

102.6 --> 105.19999999999999
a lot

111.24 --> 116.399
so yeah it's pretty sunny it's kind of

114.479 --> 120.5
warm out there

116.399 --> 120.5
I had to give the plants a lot of water

121.2 --> 125.21900000000001
because they definitely dry out in this

123.06 --> 128.3
kind of heat

125.219 --> 130.85999999999999
right so yeah

128.3 --> 132.84
hot Summer's Day

130.86 --> 136.62
for the Netherlands anyway I think it's

132.84 --> 139.379
like 25 to or 20. it's like deep in the

136.62 --> 142.26
20s the temperature

139.379 --> 144.35999999999999
anyway hello us first in chat Dr utker

142.26 --> 150.35999999999999
good to see you

144.36 --> 150.36
it's Friday the 18th of August 2023

151.76 --> 154.94
[Music]

157.82 --> 164.0
[Music]

160.26 --> 164.0
24 degrees oh okay

164.099 --> 169.33999999999997
and they keep saying it's going to be 28

166.2 --> 169.33999999999997
but it isn't really

172.98 --> 178.7
all right

175.26 --> 178.7
anyway hello Richard G

185.239 --> 191.04
so yeah I'm in a pretty hectic situation

188.04 --> 193.2
right now financially

191.04 --> 195.239
because

193.2 --> 197.7
well

195.239 --> 200.09900000000002
I said I wouldn't come on yesterday if I

197.7 --> 203.35999999999999
didn't get any PayPal but

200.099 --> 203.35999999999999
I can't check it

204.659 --> 209.819
because it's the man it's insisting that

208.379 --> 212.64
I

209.819 --> 215.099
I did I confirm

212.64 --> 216.05999999999997
through my mobile phone and yeah guess

215.099 --> 219.06
what

216.06 --> 221.64000000000001
it's not you can't reach it

219.06 --> 223.799
so it's insisting every single time an

221.64 --> 226.67999999999998
idea basically can't get in my PayPal so

223.799 --> 229.37900000000002
I had to order a phone

226.68 --> 232.08
and then this morning I found out that

229.379 --> 234.06
apparently I didn't follow up on the

232.08 --> 238.09900000000002
order yesterday so it's gonna take even

234.06 --> 238.099
longer for [ __ ] sake

238.2 --> 244.01899999999998
but yeah by tomorrow I should be having

240.72 --> 246.9
a phone again that should work

244.019 --> 249.54
it's gonna cost me like yeah 60 Euros

246.9 --> 252.36
but yeah fortunately I don't have to

249.54 --> 254.879
like immediately pay that so I could do

252.36 --> 257.699
that at least

254.879 --> 260.21999999999997
and then I can check by tomorrow whether

257.699 --> 263.22
I did get a PayPal or not

260.22 --> 265.86
so by all means everybody please pile on

263.22 --> 269.88000000000005
I really I I mean I'm really in need of

265.86 --> 273.06
it I don't have anything to smoke

269.88 --> 276.0
but yeah I've been trying to work out

273.06 --> 281.3
like can I find a way to somehow borrow

276.0 --> 281.3
it from anybody roommates included and

281.34 --> 285.32
it's not looking really great thus far

287.16 --> 294.18
right I do have food however I didn't

290.04 --> 296.16
manage to buy food dinner

294.18 --> 298.979
and some

296.16 --> 301.86
bread and eggs

298.979 --> 303.78
for a bit so I I'm not literally gonna

301.86 --> 305.82
starve but

303.78 --> 308.34
although I basically only have dinner

305.82 --> 311.96
for one more day

308.34 --> 311.96
so I am in trouble here

314.08 --> 317.84
[Music]

315.3 --> 317.84000000000003
right

319.08 --> 324.65999999999997
also kept me up this night I went to bed

321.6 --> 327.06
way too late but didn't really seem to

324.66 --> 329.46000000000004
matter all that much I'm still here

327.06 --> 333.86
relatively on time

329.46 --> 337.13899999999995
right but yesterday yeah events Nathan

333.86 --> 341.94
uh did like a two hour show

337.139 --> 344.40000000000003
with Jaren and first he he did it live

341.94 --> 346.44
through members only stream and then he

344.4 --> 349.5
premiered it

346.44 --> 352.02
later in the night and was very late so

349.5 --> 354.24
yeah that was like from one to three

352.02 --> 357.479
o'clock in the night

354.24 --> 360.259
but still yeah it was fun in the chat

357.479 --> 360.25899999999996
doing that

364.02 --> 370.94
and jiren is just a disaster I mean he

367.44 --> 370.94
is a disaster

374.0 --> 381.06
with no doubt we're going to be talking

376.44 --> 381.06
about it on Flat Earth debates later

391.19 --> 394.269
[Music]

413.039 --> 417.9
all right so how are you guys doing I

415.08 --> 421.34
hope you're doing better than me

417.9 --> 421.34
wasn't surprising really

422.699 --> 428.72
no it wasn't it was it's just really

426.0 --> 428.72
disappointing

430.5 --> 433.259
together

431.74 --> 437.16
[Music]

433.259 --> 439.02000000000004
one of them Rage Quit no no Nathan just

437.16 --> 442.319
left after one point because all what

439.02 --> 443.69899999999996
Jaren was doing was at homing he was

442.319 --> 449.03900000000004
just

443.699 --> 452.039
ad homing ad homing projecting all hell

449.039 --> 455.34
and it was ridiculous and Nathan just

452.039 --> 457.56
like eventually got sick of just

455.34 --> 460.73999999999995
trying to explain the scientific method

457.56 --> 462.9
which jiren would continually just avoid

460.74 --> 465.78000000000003
understanding

462.9 --> 468.06
and you're yeah Nathan just got sick of

465.78 --> 470.15999999999997
it eventually like yeah I'm not here to

468.06 --> 472.62
just hear your ad homs all the time and

470.16 --> 475.02000000000004
whining about how I run my show while

472.62 --> 478.02
you rump a stutter all over me

475.02 --> 481.02
every single time I answer a question

478.02 --> 483.71999999999997
that you asked right so he was just sick

481.02 --> 486.539
of it eventually

483.72 --> 489.38000000000005
did not Rage Quit Nathan was like not

486.539 --> 489.38
angry at all

489.66 --> 494.0
was extremely mild tempered

496.44 --> 501.259
a terror 306 gamer guy

504.44 --> 509.0
you had fun or you watched it too

516.599 --> 523.26
but yeah no German didn't Rage Quit

520.2 --> 526.5
Nathan just left and then jiren

523.26 --> 528.66
proceeded to like ramble and whine and

526.5 --> 531.24
just curse

528.66 --> 532.74
for like an hour straight or roar I

531.24 --> 534.36
don't know how long it was but I heard

532.74 --> 536.64
from other guys they just kept on

534.36 --> 540.0
rambling after Nathan had left just

536.64 --> 543.8389999999999
non-stop at home Non-Stop

540.0 --> 546.8
like at home non-stop it was it was

543.839 --> 546.8000000000001
really pathetic

558.24 --> 564.66
no Nathan did not run away he just left

562.019 --> 565.74
because it was sick of just getting at

564.66 --> 567.6
home

565.74 --> 570.6
like while he was trying to have a

567.6 --> 573.0600000000001
discussion explaining it

570.6 --> 574.62
explaining the scientific method jiren

573.06 --> 577.3199999999999
just kept at-homing

574.62 --> 579.48
and and being Incorrect and eventually

577.32 --> 581.899
he just got sick of it

579.48 --> 586.22
anything got sick of it he did not run

581.899 --> 586.22
it just got sick of it and left

592.76 --> 597.74
couldn't stop laughing over what gamer

595.56 --> 597.7399999999999
guy

613.62 --> 618.54
so jiren was a glober yeah

616.32 --> 621.839
well we're kind of thinking that too

618.54 --> 624.06
because Jared seems to make like a hell

621.839 --> 626.94
of an effort to

624.06 --> 628.5
to basically try to negate all the Flat

626.94 --> 630.72
Earth debate

628.5 --> 633.62
discovered arguments

630.72 --> 633.62
so yeah

641.82 --> 645.9590000000001
right so yeah Jaren might have been

644.1 --> 649.38
schooled thoroughly but he didn't learn

645.959 --> 652.92
a thing out of it Derek not a thing

649.38 --> 654.18
it just waffle and complained on for

652.92 --> 657.4799999999999
like an hour

654.18 --> 660.2399999999999
afterward kind of like Dell does right

657.48 --> 662.7
it just ramble and Randall and rave

660.24 --> 665.22
until he's like got it out of his system

662.7 --> 667.1400000000001
and then he can forget all about all the

665.22 --> 671.5400000000001
humiliating things he just put himself

667.14 --> 671.54
through oh that's kind of what jiren did

673.86 --> 679.0790000000001
she now barely no it was mostly jiren's

677.1 --> 681.6
ego Nathan didn't

679.079 --> 684.38
let himself get caught up in that [ __ ]

681.6 --> 686.88
he was just trying to get his

684.38 --> 690.079
communication out without Jaren

686.88 --> 690.079
rumpusing him all the time

695.82 --> 701.3000000000001
yeah there's a lot that jiren didn't get

698.579 --> 701.3
in LSG

708.66 --> 711.68
that's right Oz

724.519 --> 729.0600000000001
okay I don't know what that means

727.5 --> 730.56
babe

729.06 --> 732.7399999999999
I don't know what the hell you're doing

730.56 --> 732.7399999999999
here

733.019 --> 736.44
but uh yeah jiren doesn't know a whole

735.48 --> 739.2
lot

736.44 --> 741.2600000000001
so whatever you just said there I doubt

739.2 --> 741.26
it

749.839 --> 752.839
foreign

754.579 --> 759.18
they're all unsubscribing Nathan they're

757.68 --> 762.5999999999999
all unsubscribing because you're being

759.18 --> 766.4399999999999
so mean yeah in the meantime you can't

762.6 --> 768.48
you simply cannot figure out

766.44 --> 770.1
the basic premise of the scientific

768.48 --> 773.279
method

770.1 --> 775.8000000000001
the General's just non-stop scatter gun

773.279 --> 779.12
projecting like all the way it was

775.8 --> 779.12
really miserable

779.16 --> 785.54
like

781.32 --> 785.5400000000001
watching that did make me miserable

790.5 --> 795.72
it was only doable because I could

792.839 --> 798.0600000000001
basically tell in the chat live how much

795.72 --> 800.339
of a [ __ ] wit he really is and that's

798.06 --> 802.38
the only May that only way to make it

800.339 --> 804.7790000000001
bearable having said through that what

802.38 --> 807.899
Jeremy was doing

804.779 --> 810.6
guy is just so [ __ ] obnoxious it's

807.899 --> 813.44
unbelievable

810.6 --> 813.44
foreign

815.959 --> 820.7399999999999
with what he did yesterday I am

818.459 --> 823.9799999999999
seriously starting to contemplate that

820.74 --> 826.44
maybe every person that has ever clashed

823.98 --> 829.26
with him like including

826.44 --> 831.72
Flat Earth [ __ ] Jake the [ __ ]

829.26 --> 835.62
that maybe

831.72 --> 837.839
they were probably right after all

835.62 --> 839.76
because I just assumed like a Jake is an

837.839 --> 840.7790000000001
[ __ ] he used drugs on the camera he's

839.76 --> 844.079
an idiot

840.779 --> 846.54
so he's probably just trolling Jaren but

844.079 --> 848.6999999999999
now that I've seen this I'm starting to

846.54 --> 852.959
realize well

848.7 --> 855.0600000000001
maybe maybe Jaron was just a repulsive

852.959 --> 858.42
piece of [ __ ]

855.06 --> 861.779
to him just like he is now

858.42 --> 866.06
so in that case yeah maybe maybe Jake

861.779 --> 866.06
the [ __ ] isn't that bad after all

867.66 --> 873.54
he is a super creep yeah but if you

870.779 --> 876.5
compare him to jiren I mean it's not

873.54 --> 876.5
that bad then

882.959 --> 888.0
wouldn't want to get on with Dave

885.959 --> 891.18
Anderson what the [ __ ] are you whining

888.0 --> 891.18
about Bev

891.38 --> 898.4399999999999
Darren had no good points zero

895.8 --> 901.399
and what the [ __ ] about that is supposed

898.44 --> 901.399
to be a good point

902.88 --> 909.3
what what is a good point about non-stop

906.12 --> 911.399
whining and complaining on how Nathan

909.3 --> 913.8599999999999
does his shows how he does his

911.399 --> 914.88
argumentation and how we treat other

913.86 --> 917.94
people

914.88 --> 919.86
when the actual dispute was about the

917.94 --> 921.7790000000001
scientific method

919.86 --> 925.1990000000001
Bev

921.779 --> 926.82
yeah Jaren did not have a good point

925.199 --> 930.12
at all

926.82 --> 933.48
he was just whining

930.12 --> 936.48
and complaining about the format

933.48 --> 939.3000000000001
just whining and complaining I know that

936.48 --> 941.519
to you that's perfectly normal

939.3 --> 944.279
yeah

941.519 --> 946.62
like for you that is the default you

944.279 --> 948.3
just do that well guess what it's not

946.62 --> 950.88
argumentation

948.3 --> 955.399
it's called at home and it's a [ __ ]

950.88 --> 955.399
waste of time it's not a good point

966.55 --> 968.959
[Music]

966.959 --> 968.959
um

969.86 --> 975.779
but it's very typical that you would

972.6 --> 978.24
come out and and start to try to put

975.779 --> 981.6
Darren in a good light after that that's

978.24 --> 984.0600000000001
very typical and noted Bev

981.6 --> 986.82
of course of course you are going to be

984.06 --> 991.3199999999999
in opposition to Nathan no matter what

986.82 --> 994.0790000000001
because you're just as scummy as jiren

991.32 --> 996.36
left you're just as scummy it may be

994.079 --> 998.16
worse but with you it's more out in the

996.36 --> 999.899
open people know that you're a

998.16 --> 1002.86
double-speaking liar

999.899 --> 1002.86
about things

1002.959 --> 1007.6389999999999
and that you never ever admit when

1005.66 --> 1010.759
you're wrong even when it's really

1007.639 --> 1012.32
blatantly obvious yeah

1010.759 --> 1016.1800000000001
so

1012.32 --> 1016.1800000000001
spare us your opinions

1019.459 --> 1022.88
why wouldn't Nathan want to be part of

1021.38 --> 1026.0
Dave's app

1022.88 --> 1028.819
because it's [ __ ] pointless and it's

1026.0 --> 1031.78
a disc reification

1028.819 --> 1031.78
that's why

1039.919 --> 1045.439
and besides Dave literally on record

1043.22 --> 1048.38
said like I don't listen to Nathan

1045.439 --> 1051.8600000000001
Oakley after having literally sent

1048.38 --> 1055.3400000000001
people over to Nathan to debate

1051.86 --> 1058.7199999999998
for his Bitcoin yeah so that's part of

1055.34 --> 1058.72
the reason why

1060.679 --> 1065.26
aren't we all on the same team no no

1062.78 --> 1065.26
we're not

1067.94 --> 1073.64
yeah I'm on the team

1070.16 --> 1077.24
that understands the scientific method

1073.64 --> 1078.5590000000002
and that knows what pseudoscience and

1077.24 --> 1084.08
what isn't

1078.559 --> 1085.94
Jaron is not on that side he's a muppet

1084.08 --> 1089.72
you think science doesn't prove anything

1085.94 --> 1093.26
he doubled down on it and literally had

1089.72 --> 1095.1200000000001
the the idiocy to suggest that things

1093.26 --> 1099.2
that are scientifically proven could

1095.12 --> 1102.32
change over time which is asinine

1099.2 --> 1106.299
it's really [ __ ] stupid

1102.32 --> 1106.299
yeah not on our team

1114.86 --> 1120.53
Bev is a clover no Bev is just a

1118.539 --> 1123.589
recalcitrant ass

1120.53 --> 1123.589
[Music]

1123.679 --> 1129.74
he's one of those guys that just just

1126.5 --> 1133.1
can't call the earth flat oh my God no

1129.74 --> 1136.58
no it has to be anything but flat

1133.1 --> 1139.78
so Bev is more like a glober that's or a

1136.58 --> 1139.78
flat earther that's just

1140.48 --> 1144.559
doesn't want to be a flatter so yeah

1142.4 --> 1146.72
he's kind of an anti-flatter

1144.559 --> 1149.36
that's still sort of pretending like

1146.72 --> 1151.039
being a flat earther unless push comes

1149.36 --> 1153.3799999999999
to shove and then suddenly is and he's

1151.039 --> 1155.9
just really really special

1153.38 --> 1159.64
definitely not flat yeah and you're

1155.9 --> 1159.64
definitely [ __ ]

1165.919 --> 1170.539

1168.02 --> 1172.94
with Beth about this [ __ ]

1170.539 --> 1174.919
yeah it's just the same recycled old

1172.94 --> 1176.78
nonsense he's spouting out and now he's

1174.919 --> 1179.44
choosing to spout that out in my chat

1176.78 --> 1179.44
for some reason

1190.64 --> 1194.96
there's no discussion obviously yeah

1192.919 --> 1197.6000000000001
there isn't any discussion that's right

1194.96 --> 1199.96

degree angle

1833.96 --> 1837.44
right

1835.36 --> 1840.6999999999998
using a

1837.44 --> 1843.8600000000001
a plane a flat Baseline the entire

1840.7 --> 1845.6000000000001
Cartesian coordinate system is based off

1843.86 --> 1847.58
a flat plane

1845.6 --> 1850.82
and the angles are taken off flat

1847.58 --> 1853.58
baselines we know we don't need you to

1850.82 --> 1856.34
keep posting parts of that page you're

2133.599 --> 2141.52
of that but I can say it yeah you in the

2176.26 --> 2179.4990000000003
[Music]

2179.8 --> 2182.7000000000003
okay

2200.56 --> 2206.38
yeah and hey I only have power here

2203.859 --> 2209.56
because it's my show

2206.38 --> 2210.46
and if you want to be in the chat on my

2209.56 --> 2213.82
show

2210.46 --> 2216.099
well then I have power over whether you

2213.82 --> 2219.06
are going to be part of the chat of my

2216.099 --> 2219.06
show you see

2219.579 --> 2224.7400000000002
so yeah I do have that power and you're

2221.98 --> 2227.38
here coming here just to get banned so I

2224.74 --> 2230.859
definitely have power over you because

2227.38 --> 2234.46
you're the one that insists that they

2230.859 --> 2235.54
want to break the rules of my show in my

2234.46 --> 2237.64
chat

2235.54 --> 2240.7599999999998
I do have power over you you're the one

2237.64 --> 2243.5789999999997
coming here you're trying to

2240.76 --> 2245.0200000000004
negate my power somehow and it doesn't

2243.579 --> 2247.6600000000003
work

2245.02 --> 2250.24
I will just kick you out because I have

2247.66 --> 2252.54
that power because it's my show and my

2250.24 --> 2252.54
chat

2252.64 --> 2260.46
and if you don't like that if you find

2254.98 --> 2260.46
that off-putting well then [ __ ] off then

2263.37 --> 2266.58
[Music]

2279.099 --> 2282.7200000000003
yeah that's right gamer guy

2294.099 --> 2300.7000000000003
I mean can you imagine the insanity of a

2297.46 --> 2303.099
world where literally everybody has the

2300.7 --> 2305.5
right to say whatever they want wherever

2303.099 --> 2306.6400000000003
they want without anybody being able to

2305.5 --> 2310.3
stop them

2306.64 --> 2311.7999999999997
can you imagine the the irredeemable

2310.3 --> 2314.02
chaos

2311.8 --> 2315.579
that will get for that will Spring forth

2314.02 --> 2318.04
from that

2315.579 --> 2320.1400000000003
like everybody like nobody could do

2318.04 --> 2321.64
anything without any everybody else

2320.14 --> 2324.66
ruining it

2321.64 --> 2324.66
that's crazy

2326.92 --> 2333.579
you'd you'd have a worldwide Marxist

2330.0 --> 2336.52
Revolution explosion like everybody

2333.579 --> 2337.8390000000004
would start ruining everybody else's

2336.52 --> 2341.02
stuff

2337.839 --> 2343.359
everybody else's Communications it's

2341.02 --> 2344.82
terrible yeah it doesn't work like that

2343.359 --> 2348.88
free speech

2344.82 --> 2351.6400000000003
is about the person doing the speaking

2348.88 --> 2355.0
like on a platform

2351.64 --> 2358.18
right or like oh I'm gonna go to a

2355.0 --> 2359.8
a speaking square like some Square where

2358.18 --> 2362.0789999999997
they have markets and all and there's a

2359.8 --> 2363.7000000000003
speech place there and so and then you

2362.079 --> 2365.619
go there and you do speech if somebody

2363.7 --> 2366.9399999999996
comes if police comes in like hey shut

2365.619 --> 2368.859
up you're talking about something and

2366.94 --> 2371.32
we're not allowing that yeah

2368.859 --> 2373.66
that's a violation of free speech why

2371.32 --> 2376.78
because it's the guy that took the

2373.66 --> 2379.2999999999997
initiative to start doing that in a

2376.78 --> 2382.3590000000004
place designated for it right just like

2379.3 --> 2385.0
YouTube is a place designated for people

2382.359 --> 2388.24
to get a YouTube account and then make

2385.0 --> 2390.88
videos and appear on the videos and have

2388.24 --> 2394.4199999999996
their free speech and say whatever their

2390.88 --> 2397.359
opinions are yeah that's the free speech

2394.42 --> 2399.579
now if that person then chooses to have

2397.359 --> 2400.48
other people involved like through a

2399.579 --> 2403.54
chat

2400.48 --> 2407.02
well those people in the chat are just

2403.54 --> 2409.7799999999997
lucky that they have the free chat it

2407.02 --> 2413.44
does not guarantee free speech

2409.78 --> 2415.5400000000004
yeah if they're gonna talk [ __ ] then the

2413.44 --> 2418.359
channel owner or the moderators have the

2415.54 --> 2421.92
right to kick you out you don't have

2418.359 --> 2421.92
free speech in chats

2422.5 --> 2427.44
you have free speech on your own

2424.9 --> 2427.44
platform

2428.56 --> 2432.4
right

2429.64 --> 2434.92
and my free speech to a degree is

2432.4 --> 2438.28
limited to even on my own platform here

2434.92 --> 2441.94
by YouTube rules I have to abide

2438.28 --> 2445.78
or they will kick me yeah so

2441.94 --> 2449.56
the only real pure free speech is on

2445.78 --> 2452.8590000000004
your own platform that you own and you

2449.56 --> 2455.02
moderate and you make all the rules

2452.859 --> 2457.96
like what Owen Benjamin does

2455.02 --> 2460.359
and he has the rules like yeah you can

2457.96 --> 2462.82
say these words here

2460.359 --> 2464.74
and we will literally not do anything

2462.82 --> 2466.78
not even give you a timeout not even

2464.74 --> 2469.5
give you a warning email you can just

2466.78 --> 2474.5400000000004
say that here

2469.5 --> 2474.54
definitively right that's free speech

2488.64 --> 2494.6189999999997
you will lose it okay get the [ __ ] out

2492.099 --> 2497.28
of here you're just a scumbag

2494.619 --> 2497.28
[ __ ] off

2499.119 --> 2502.56
you're just a scumbag

2504.7 --> 2511.0
first you go capsing and then

2507.94 --> 2513.52
you're threatening me

2511.0 --> 2516.66
you're literally threatening me for

2513.52 --> 2516.66
through innuendo

2517.119 --> 2522.1600000000003
what that might I'm gonna you're gonna

2519.46 --> 2525.099
strike me if I keep this up well get the

2522.16 --> 2527.8199999999997
[ __ ] out of here then scumbag you're not

2525.099 --> 2527.82
gonna do anything

2529.78 --> 2537.099
yeah once you go try go try yeah like

2534.099 --> 2539.02
all those other tries of people striking

2537.099 --> 2540.579
my channel because they don't like me

2539.02 --> 2543.28
yeah

2540.579 --> 2545.5
good [ __ ] luck with that

2543.28 --> 2547.2400000000002
yeah why don't you look at that show

2545.5 --> 2551.26
from two days ago

2547.24 --> 2553.8999999999996
yeah that didn't get a strike yeah

2551.26 --> 2557.0200000000004
he didn't get a strike they're not gonna

2553.9 --> 2560.38
give me a strike because some stupid ass

2557.02 --> 2563.02
chat troll with a bad attitude thinks

2560.38 --> 2564.099
that my free speech should be taken away

2563.02 --> 2566.64
yeah

2564.099 --> 2566.6400000000003
dick

2567.7 --> 2570.7
foreign

2577.3 --> 2585.3590000000004
that's right gamer guy so yeah I I'm not

2580.66 --> 2585.359
I'm gonna be careful to a certain degree

2585.579 --> 2588.4
right

2587.14 --> 2591.9
but I mean

2588.4 --> 2591.9
it's working just fine

2593.339 --> 2598.72
I

2595.119 --> 2602.44
gave myself a lot of freedom in what I

2598.72 --> 2606.22
talk about and it's working just fine

2602.44 --> 2609.46
because of a reason you see I figured

2606.22 --> 2612.1189999999997
out how this policy from YouTube is

2609.46 --> 2612.119
actually working

2612.78 --> 2619.9
I know what the Bots are scanning for in

2617.98 --> 2622.18
order to determine whether they're gonna

2619.9 --> 2625.3
take you down or not

2622.18 --> 2628.44
I know what is risky material and what

2625.3 --> 2632.7400000000002
are actually risky actions

2628.44 --> 2634.359
so that's why I mostly prevent playing

2632.74 --> 2637.9599999999996
videos

2634.359 --> 2641.7999999999997
on my channel because I would end up

2637.96 --> 2644.56
playing little video snaps of like

2641.8 --> 2646.8390000000004
alternative medical doctors that are

2644.56 --> 2649.18
like gonna talk about how certain

2646.839 --> 2651.16
medical experimentations were just

2649.18 --> 2654.46
completely

2651.16 --> 2657.7
like on there weren't a mistake they

2654.46 --> 2660.52
were a malevolent project like that's

2657.7 --> 2662.5
like yeah if I play videos of that you

2660.52 --> 2665.14
could bet your ass that YouTube's gonna

2662.5 --> 2668.079
like do something about it right and

2665.14 --> 2670.48
that's why I avoid that all the time

2668.079 --> 2672.94
and they only play things

2670.48 --> 2675.46
when I know there's absolutely no risk

2672.94 --> 2678.7000000000003
involved or like it's somebody's

2675.46 --> 2680.079
personal product that they want me to

2678.7 --> 2682.24
play on the show

2680.079 --> 2684.54
like a song they made right that's

2682.24 --> 2684.54
different

2685.06 --> 2690.2799999999997
and I know what I'm doing I know what I

2687.46 --> 2693.64
can say and I can criticize people

2690.28 --> 2696.2200000000003
I can criticize Jews even

2693.64 --> 2698.68
but I'm not gonna like personally like

2696.22 --> 2700.18
take an individual that identifies as a

2698.68 --> 2703.8999999999996
Jew and then start criticizing them

2700.18 --> 2705.8799999999997
endlessly I never do that

2703.9 --> 2707.619
do I

2705.88 --> 2710.5
no

2707.619 --> 2715.8
but I'll make jokes

2710.5 --> 2715.8
a little bit jokes about Jews sure

2716.98 --> 2722.68
right or other groups

2719.56 --> 2726.42
like I just do that

2722.68 --> 2726.4199999999996
like I reserve the right

2727.06 --> 2731.98
yeah and I will not push it too far and

2729.22 --> 2735.2799999999997
I'll definitely not allow people that

2731.98 --> 2737.079
are really obsessed with Jews negatively

2735.28 --> 2738.579
and I think that they're that they're

2737.079 --> 2740.5600000000004
like in control of everything they're

2738.579 --> 2741.88
doing all the yeah I'm not letting those

2740.56 --> 2745.619
people in

2741.88 --> 2745.619
because that's ridiculous

2745.72 --> 2753.0989999999997
I'm not like that but I will definitely

2748.78 --> 2757.42
make fun of their ways and their tactics

2753.099 --> 2758.6800000000003
yeah and YouTube is just fine with that

2757.42 --> 2762.04
yeah

2758.68 --> 2766.2599999999998
as long as I don't specifically start

2762.04 --> 2766.2599999999998
denying certain claimed events

2768.28 --> 2774.1600000000003
and I can just talk around it and just a

2772.54 --> 2775.72
new window

2774.16 --> 2779.3799999999997
how

2775.72 --> 2781.06
uh acclaimed event might not have

2779.38 --> 2784.26
happened right

2781.06 --> 2787.48
I won't actually say that

2784.26 --> 2789.46
but I can basically point at things that

2787.48 --> 2791.98
show with completely different picture

2789.46 --> 2797.64
of what was actually going on

2791.98 --> 2802.0
right without saying it I can do that

2797.64 --> 2805.7799999999997
I can be tactical with how I explain

2802.0 --> 2808.0
things because I'm very good at

2805.78 --> 2811.96
explaining things I'm very Dynamic and

2808.0 --> 2815.38
that Dynamic nature can help me to say

2811.96 --> 2816.819
things very clearly without saying them

2815.38 --> 2819.1800000000003
yeah

2816.819 --> 2823.7799999999997
and it's very simple

2819.18 --> 2824.68
algorithms and strike policies can't use

2823.78 --> 2828.76
that

2824.68 --> 2832.1189999999997
they can't strike you on innuendo they

2828.76 --> 2834.099
literally can't and the Bots can't pick

2832.119 --> 2836.38
up on it

2834.099 --> 2839.38
right

2836.38 --> 2840.94
so yeah innuendo it's a time and a place

2839.38 --> 2843.52
for everything

2840.94 --> 2845.14
don't be using the window for

2843.52 --> 2847.56
backstabbing

2845.14 --> 2850.359
use it for when there's actual

2847.56 --> 2852.22
censorship happening and you insist you

2850.359 --> 2855.16
want to say something about the subject

2852.22 --> 2857.6189999999997
that's censored but not get punished for

2855.16 --> 2860.02
it well then you'll have to talk around

2857.619 --> 2862.26
it and use innuendo

2860.02 --> 2865.339
and I can do that and I just did

2862.26 --> 2865.3390000000004
[Music]

2867.94 --> 2871.02
and I'm still here

2874.119 --> 2879.579
yeah oh that's too true as well Tory

2877.48 --> 2881.56
Lane

2879.579 --> 2883.96
right as long as you aren't calling for

2881.56 --> 2886.48
the harm of others right so yeah and

2883.96 --> 2890.319
that also can be

2886.48 --> 2892.18
addressed very or I can work with that

2890.319 --> 2895.48
as well because you see I don't

2892.18 --> 2898.1189999999997
literally threaten individuals

2895.48 --> 2899.7400000000002
I vent my hatred perhaps about

2898.119 --> 2903.52
individuals

2899.74 --> 2906.16
but every time I get all berserky and

2903.52 --> 2910.0
like vicious and [ __ ] you might have

2906.16 --> 2912.52
noticed that I never at the end of that

2910.0 --> 2915.94
put it in individual

2912.52 --> 2920.02
in the way of the target I never do

2915.94 --> 2923.859
I just say people who do this or who

2920.02 --> 2927.64
would do that that's who I'm gonna like

2923.859 --> 2930.22
do you know what to right I never say oh

2927.64 --> 2932.6189999999997
that person you did that I'm gonna get

2930.22 --> 2936.5789999999997
him no no no no no no no I'm just gonna

2932.619 --> 2939.4
say people who do this are gonna get it

2936.579 --> 2942.46
yeah that's how I say things

2939.4 --> 2947.56
and they can't do anything about that

2942.46 --> 2950.56
because I'm not targeting any individual

2947.56 --> 2950.56
see

2954.46 --> 2959.98
because you aren't really serious

2957.04 --> 2963.16
well maybe I am

2959.98 --> 2966.099
maybe I am really serious maybe I do

2963.16 --> 2968.14
really think that people that for

2966.099 --> 2970.3
insurance scams

2968.14 --> 2973.48
or because they're employees of

2970.3 --> 2976.8390000000004
BlackRock or whatever are part of a wef

2973.48 --> 2979.119
agenda would literally burn down an

2976.839 --> 2984.22
entire village with people and all

2979.119 --> 2986.319
yeah I would definitely put like impale

2984.22 --> 2988.18
them with a large stick and then set

2986.319 --> 2991.42
them on fire with their own gasoline

2988.18 --> 2994.839
yeah I would definitely be all for that

2991.42 --> 2997.0
yeah now in physical reality it's very

2994.839 --> 3000.359
unlikely I get to the point of actually

2997.0 --> 3003.72
physically doing that you see I'm a very

3000.359 --> 3006.72
sensitive person and despite my vicious

3003.72 --> 3009.839
mind I do not really have the stomach

3006.72 --> 3012.98
for actual gruesomeness

3009.839 --> 3012.98
in the real world

3013.079 --> 3017.94
but that doesn't mean that I don't mean

3015.42 --> 3020.04
it that I don't think that people that

3017.94 --> 3025.079
do those sort of things should meet a

3020.04 --> 3027.48
horrific end I definitely do mean that

3025.079 --> 3032.76
you see

3027.48 --> 3032.76
[Music]

3032.9 --> 3039.319
so yeah I am really serious but I'm also

3036.42 --> 3039.319
very careful

3046.5 --> 3051.9
my lash out is the overhype to highlight

3049.319 --> 3054.66
how much you think they deserve yes

3051.9 --> 3056.78
that's right gamer guy you seem to get

3054.66 --> 3056.7799999999997
it

3058.5 --> 3064.44
you're a smart girl

3061.38 --> 3068.599
by the way can I ask how old are you

3064.44 --> 3068.599
you still you do seem kind of young

3073.619 --> 3078.2400000000002
but I mean in a good way

3075.839 --> 3083.839
people that are young and already very

3078.24 --> 3083.839
smart are like the future so 18. wow

3084.839 --> 3089.48
are you married

3086.52 --> 3089.48
probably not

3089.94 --> 3095.28
and where do you live by the way is it

3092.4 --> 3097.5
in Europe or in the United States or

3095.28 --> 3099.7200000000003
but I mean I'm seeing you say a lot of

3097.5 --> 3102.54
good things you just play games fair

3099.72 --> 3107.04
enough I used to play games all night

3102.54 --> 3111.2
and day when I was a kid so like I

3107.04 --> 3111.2
didn't have a social life I just gamed

3115.319 --> 3120.319
okay

3117.54 --> 3120.319
am I back

3124.559 --> 3127.52
yeah I'm back

3128.4 --> 3132.3
all right yeah there was OBS just

3131.339 --> 3134.7599999999998
started

3132.3 --> 3137.579
not working for some weird reason it

3134.76 --> 3140.099
wasn't my internet this time anyway yeah

3137.579 --> 3141.9
gamer guy is definitely a girl that was

3140.099 --> 3144.9
established very quickly also when you

3141.9 --> 3149.819
go to their page

3144.9 --> 3151.7400000000002
like it's it literally says gamer girl I

3149.819 --> 3154.339
don't know why you

3151.74 --> 3154.339
whatever

3155.339 --> 3161.22
so the logo is actually girl gamer but

3158.819 --> 3164.64
the account is gamer guy I don't know

3161.22 --> 3166.319
but it's also the name is Leah so

3164.64 --> 3168.0
I don't know why you'd call yourself

3166.319 --> 3169.619
gamer guy why don't you just call

3168.0 --> 3171.66
yourself gamer girl

3169.619 --> 3173.28
or

3171.66 --> 3176.52
do you do

3173.28 --> 3179.52
you call yourself gamer guy to avoid a

3176.52 --> 3182.48
bunch of dirty perverts coming after you

3179.52 --> 3182.48
or something online

3182.819 --> 3187.46
I could imagine that to be a reason for

3185.339 --> 3187.46
that

3192.96 --> 3196.5
easy okay

3200.9 --> 3207.859
right but uh yeah Canada well thanks for

3204.78 --> 3207.8590000000004
sharing all that by the way

3212.099 --> 3217.8
it's already perfect realist no it's

3215.22 --> 3220.5589999999997
just that online

3217.8 --> 3222.7400000000002
I mean in the physical world gamer girls

3220.559 --> 3226.26
are kind of popular with the Nerds

3222.74 --> 3228.359
unless they're like really

3226.26 --> 3230.5200000000004
chauvinist or something because it's all

3228.359 --> 3233.46
the rage

3230.52 --> 3236.88
but online I mean

3233.46 --> 3239.2200000000003
there's gun like dude all the women here

3236.88 --> 3242.2200000000003
that are flat earthers online they all

3239.22 --> 3244.8799999999997
just got overrun with pervert emails and

3242.22 --> 3244.8799999999997
[ __ ] so

3263.579 --> 3267.559
yeah Bill Nye design today that's fine

3268.68 --> 3274.0789999999997
some girls aren't like into girly stuff

3271.8 --> 3276.6800000000003
Bill Nye the science Snyder that's just

3274.079 --> 3276.6800000000003
the way it is

3281.46 --> 3287.42
didn't I sing about it in Beth is not in

3284.94 --> 3287.42
this chapter

3287.48 --> 3292.079
he's not in there anymore I kicked him

3289.859 --> 3294.119
out because he kept whining

3292.079 --> 3297.319
about how the Earth is not flat because

3294.119 --> 3297.319
it's a [ __ ] [ __ ]

3305.04 --> 3307.94
wow

3308.96 --> 3316.2
ah yes yes

3311.9 --> 3320.76
smile is of course I'm lying I

3316.2 --> 3323.96
continually misrepresent the globe facts

3320.76 --> 3323.96
don't you know that

3325.61 --> 3328.719
[Music]

3341.94 --> 3348.2400000000002
what was that impression that was Mr

3345.059 --> 3352.0400000000004
Burns from The Simpsons

3348.24 --> 3352.04
don't you recognize him

3352.44 --> 3360.319
come on Smithers you're not that thick

3356.099 --> 3360.319
you recognize this voice don't you

3373.02 --> 3380.16
yes facts right

3377.22 --> 3384.0589999999997
perfect Globe facts

3380.16 --> 3387.0
like the fact that Black Swan and gas

3384.059 --> 3388.3190000000004
pressure doesn't exist without a

3387.0 --> 3391.2
container

3388.319 --> 3394.68
and that there is no proof of coryella's

3391.2 --> 3397.5789999999997
deviation yeah Globe facts sure

3394.68 --> 3397.5789999999997
sure they are

3398.16 --> 3401.66
can you do a homework no

3402.54 --> 3406.339
I don't have to voice for a homer

3417.96 --> 3422.2200000000003
it's like if I try to emulate Homer that

3420.059 --> 3426.7400000000002
would start hurting my my vocal cords

3422.22 --> 3426.74
because it's like it doesn't work

3427.5 --> 3430.5
foreign

3433.4 --> 3438.619
but I mean everybody can say that who

3436.2 --> 3438.6189999999997
cares

3442.11 --> 3445.2090000000003
[Music]

3446.099 --> 3448.1600000000003
um

3453.48 --> 3457.099
but that was just

3457.7 --> 3462.02
uh crooked thank you for that

3465.96 --> 3470.7200000000003
now if I want to do Jaren then I'm gonna

3468.0 --> 3470.72
just sit like

3473.16 --> 3479.819
yeah but but the science is my change

3476.7 --> 3482.3999999999996
you never really know

3479.819 --> 3484.98
yeah

3482.4 --> 3487.559
is that Jared enough for you

3484.98 --> 3490.26
all crouched up in the corner with his

3487.559 --> 3493.0400000000004
head hiding behind his logo as he at

homs Nathan

3495.68 --> 3504.8999999999996
lays lays more lays from you explain

3499.76 --> 3508.7400000000002
meteorites Tides synonym and no Lemma

3504.9 --> 3511.8
two-star rotation pulls you can't

3508.74 --> 3515.8799999999997
you just rant crap

3511.8 --> 3517.44
no sir no no actually that's not how it

3515.88 --> 3520.339
works

3517.44 --> 3520.339
I'm sorry

3529.319 --> 3534.96
two star rotations yeah yeah I can

3532.559 --> 3536.7000000000003
address their star rotations at Sean

3534.96 --> 3539.64
Hawkins

3536.7 --> 3542.339
I think this guy's Sean Hawkins

3539.64 --> 3545.4
because of the retardation level

3542.339 --> 3548.52
or Sean Hawkins adjacent

3545.4 --> 3550.319
but uh yeah yeah do you know about the

3548.52 --> 3553.5
star rotation

3550.319 --> 3554.819
why do the stars rotate in a different

3553.5 --> 3557.46
direction

3554.819 --> 3561.9
north of the equator compared to south

3557.46 --> 3564.42
of the Equator well it's very simple

3561.9 --> 3567.02
rotates that way right

3564.42 --> 3570.0
now

3567.02 --> 3575.94
you turn around

3570.0 --> 3575.94
and it rotates that way yes

3576.42 --> 3581.04
I know you're too stupid to realize that

3579.72 --> 3585.98
by yourself

3581.04 --> 3585.98
but that's how it works

3593.04 --> 3596.09
[Music]

3606.24 --> 3612.9799999999996
would wiggle his finger before grabbing

3609.72 --> 3615.35
a donut that's weird

3612.98 --> 3616.92
you're a fool

3615.35 --> 3620.64
[Music]

3616.92 --> 3624.1800000000003
okay I mean even the Mr Burns act is not

3620.64 --> 3626.7
making this more doable

3624.18 --> 3628.9199999999996
pulse touch oh okay oh if it's at home

3626.7 --> 3632.0989999999997
I'm just gonna kick you out bye

3628.92 --> 3634.5
it was fun imitating the icon that

3632.099 --> 3637.76
you're using

3634.5 --> 3637.76
while it lasted

3656.839 --> 3663.2599999999998
rotation appears to reverse no you dumb

3661.74 --> 3667.859
[ __ ]

3663.26 --> 3667.8590000000004
you turn around

3668.099 --> 3674.6400000000003
it's going the same way

3672.0 --> 3676.46
you dumbass

3674.64 --> 3679.859
yeah

3676.46 --> 3683.819
and look to the north this is rotating

3679.859 --> 3687.359
like that and then you look to the South

3683.819 --> 3690.48
and it's rotating like that not spinning

3687.359 --> 3695.42
in the other direction you just turned

3690.48 --> 3695.42
around 180 degrees you dumbass

3699.119 --> 3702.079
thank you

3700.799 --> 3705.92
yeah

3702.079 --> 3705.92
are you getting this yet

3711.66 --> 3715.3399999999997
[Music]

3719.16 --> 3724.5
but you have to look at the bar no no

3721.5 --> 3726.66
because the star gamer guy that's a

3724.5 --> 3729.0
newbie mistake but that's fine

3726.66 --> 3731.64
but yeah the Stars aren't actually

3729.0 --> 3733.799
surrounding the earth you see that's

3731.64 --> 3735.7799999999997
also an assumption that is part of the

3733.799 --> 3737.099
globe

3735.78 --> 3740.28
but

3737.099 --> 3743.1600000000003
the Stars aren't surrounding the Flat

3740.28 --> 3745.5
Earth they are visible within the

3743.16 --> 3748.3799999999997
confines of the realm

3745.5 --> 3750.0
that means you see stars

3748.38 --> 3752.7000000000003
above us

3750.0 --> 3755.64
and they appear like they're rotating

3752.7 --> 3757.6189999999997
and you could infer a suggestion like oh

3755.64 --> 3760.3799999999997
but where does it rotate into does it

3757.619 --> 3765.1800000000003
rotate underneath us well that's a fine

3760.38 --> 3766.44
idea but it's there is no actual proof

3765.18 --> 3769.319
that they do

3766.44 --> 3770.94
it's just an inferred suggestion that

3769.319 --> 3774.599
you could

3770.94 --> 3777.2400000000002
think about right but the Stars there's

3774.599 --> 3778.559
no stars ever been spotted underneath

3777.24 --> 3780.8999999999996
the Earth like

3778.559 --> 3782.4
when you go up really high on a mountain

3780.9 --> 3787.2000000000003
at night

3782.4 --> 3790.92
the Stars don't go down further

3787.2 --> 3793.5789999999997
right the stars are only visible above

3790.92 --> 3793.579
the horizon

3800.28 --> 3804.3590000000004
and there's no proof that they surround

3802.319 --> 3807.839
the Earth

3804.359 --> 3809.94
that's just a claim that's tied in with

3807.839 --> 3812.04
the globe cosmology

3809.94 --> 3815.28
that's where they suggest that the Earth

3812.04 --> 3817.14
is a ball underneath the stars that

3815.28 --> 3819.8590000000004
would surround them

3817.14 --> 3823.5
so the globe model has a physicality

3819.859 --> 3825.96
component to the Stars

3823.5 --> 3830.04
and claims the ball is a underneath it

3825.96 --> 3830.04
in between it rotating

3831.18 --> 3836.339
in between it the Earth is a ball

3833.88 --> 3838.319
rotating in between the universe that

3836.339 --> 3841.02
support supposedly standing still in

3838.319 --> 3843.54
relation to it not really though but

3841.02 --> 3846.059
optically that's what they suggest but

3843.54 --> 3848.52
the Stars aren't actually surrounding us

3846.059 --> 3851.3390000000004
we're not a ball in the middle of a

3848.52 --> 3854.22
gigantic Cosmos with stars that surround

3851.339 --> 3858.299
us in in between which we spin

3854.22 --> 3860.0989999999997
we're on a flat plane and there is a

3858.299 --> 3863.64
weird

3860.099 --> 3866.819
Apparition a Celestial Apparition out

3863.64 --> 3870.66
there and all the lights the Sun the

3866.819 --> 3874.079
moon the planets the Stars comets

3870.66 --> 3876.5989999999997
shooting stars all of them

3874.079 --> 3878.88
right meteors are an exception though

3876.599 --> 3880.92
because they actually there's physical

3878.88 --> 3884.04
tangible evidence for them it's really

3880.92 --> 3887.2400000000002
weird like smoke and sound

3884.04 --> 3890.22
when they actually get really close by

3887.24 --> 3892.68
and I've personally witnessed that right

3890.22 --> 3896.819
but the shooting stars up there it's all

3892.68 --> 3898.799
part of a Celestial light phenomenon and

3896.819 --> 3902.04
none of the celestial light phenomenon

3898.799 --> 3906.0
have actual positions

3902.04 --> 3908.52
or yeah there it isn't there like

3906.0 --> 3911.7
you can't follow any of the celestial

3908.52 --> 3913.859
lights and actually end up reaching the

3911.7 --> 3916.4399999999996
source of it

3913.859 --> 3918.0
it's always at a distance it's a

3916.44 --> 3920.52
holographic phenomenon this is the

3918.0 --> 3922.5
reason why I call them holographic

3920.52 --> 3924.96
because there's no evidence for an

3922.5 --> 3928.319
actual position within a Cartesian grid

3924.96 --> 3930.38
coordinate system of any of the

3928.319 --> 3934.02
celestials

3930.38 --> 3935.46
including that gigantic looking

3934.02 --> 3938.04
Sun

3935.46 --> 3941.52
which is pretty much the reason why life

3938.04 --> 3942.72
exists yeah it is not an object in a

3941.52 --> 3946.44
location

3942.72 --> 3948.5989999999997
is just an angle to it and the angle

3946.44 --> 3950.819
is what changes

3948.599 --> 3953.94
but it doesn't have a position we can't

3950.819 --> 3955.98
get there when you try to approach the

3953.94 --> 3958.559
sum through the air

3955.98 --> 3961.44
you're not gonna see the angular size of

3958.559 --> 3963.78
it and increase as you would when you

3961.44 --> 3965.52
approach a physical object right

3963.78 --> 3966.96
you look at a building in a distance

3965.52 --> 3969.42
right it's oh it's a look at that

3966.96 --> 3970.859
building over there then you go towards

3969.42 --> 3973.079
the building and guess what the building

3970.859 --> 3977.16
becomes bigger and bigger the angular

3973.079 --> 3979.1400000000003
size to The Observer increases because

3977.16 --> 3981.92
it's an object and you're approaching

3979.14 --> 3986.5789999999997
yes basic perspective well guess what

3981.92 --> 3989.119
that never happens with any of the

3986.579 --> 3992.78
celestial lights including the moon

3989.119 --> 3995.6400000000003
which is suggested to be the closest

3992.78 --> 3997.02
Celestial in the heliocentric model

3995.64 --> 3999.7799999999997
right they say it's right next to us

3997.02 --> 4002.24
well it isn't right next to us because

3999.78 --> 4005.48
then you would and

4002.24 --> 4007.8799999999997
move move towards the moon as it's in

4005.48 --> 4010.4
the sky with a drone or whatever

4007.88 --> 4012.619
and or a rocket even like send it

4010.4 --> 4015.2000000000003
straight to it which is straight towards

4012.619 --> 4017.539
it well guess what keep a camera on it

4015.2 --> 4020.0589999999997
while you're flying straight at it

4017.539 --> 4022.2200000000003
if it doesn't just bend away out of

4020.059 --> 4024.3190000000004
nowhere suddenly which is already a

4022.22 --> 4025.7599999999998
clear-cut indicator it's not actually a

4024.319 --> 4027.44
physical object in a physical location

4025.76 --> 4029.599
you're seeing

4027.44 --> 4031.94
on top of that

4029.599 --> 4034.94
the angular Size Doesn't decrease you

4031.94 --> 4037.52
just keep flying and it's it it stays

4034.94 --> 4039.68
the same size it just keeps staying the

4037.52 --> 4042.2599999999998
same size you can go any distance in the

4039.68 --> 4044.1189999999997
size the angular size will remain the

4042.26 --> 4047.2990000000004
same

4044.119 --> 4051.4
because it's not a physical object it's

4047.299 --> 4051.4
a Celestial hologram

4053.96 --> 4059.42
there is no actual location for any of

4057.2 --> 4061.3999999999996
the celestial lights it's a big mystery

4059.42 --> 4064.099
and it's not solvable

4061.4 --> 4067.94
this is one of God's design Mysteries

4064.099 --> 4071.299
and it's not resolvable

4067.94 --> 4074.059
because how can you ever prove anything

4071.299 --> 4077.319
physical about anything you can never

4074.059 --> 4077.3190000000004
physically reach

4077.48 --> 4083.48
thus my conclusion it's a hologram a

4081.14 --> 4088.0589999999997
hologram is the best thing I can think

4083.48 --> 4088.059
of to attempt to describe it as

4089.42 --> 4094.579
because there's definitely not any

4091.52 --> 4097.52
physical tangible evidence for it being

4094.579 --> 4100.400000000001
an object in a location

4097.52 --> 4102.92
other than hey there's light arriving

4100.4 --> 4105.5
yeah there's definitely light arising I

4102.92 --> 4110.0
know but where is it coming from it's

4105.5 --> 4114.679
not coming from that specific point in

4110.0 --> 4117.339
space where we think the Sun is

4114.679 --> 4121.219
because if you go towards that place

4117.339 --> 4124.58
from here you don't actually reach it

4121.219 --> 4127.699
you don't reach a place where oh I'm at

4124.58 --> 4129.92
the sun here it is it's really big no it

4127.699 --> 4132.0199999999995
isn't you're not gonna see an angular

4129.92 --> 4136.1
size increase when you try to approach

4132.02 --> 4138.56
it because it's a non-local hologram

4136.1 --> 4140.6
it's not an object

4138.56 --> 4142.46
Jesus Christ what the [ __ ] happening

4140.6 --> 4144.799
in the chat

4142.46 --> 4148.0
where are all the wrenches

4144.799 --> 4148.0
who are these people

4156.44 --> 4161.299
you don't employ the scientific method

4158.719 --> 4164.0
to prove a hologram did I ever

4161.299 --> 4165.62
claim science

4164.0 --> 4168.14
on this

4165.62 --> 4170.12
it's merely a description it's the best

4168.14 --> 4172.58
description that I got

4170.12 --> 4175.64
scientific method doesn't deal with what

4172.58 --> 4178.699
is anyway yeah I'm not going to be able

4175.64 --> 4180.9800000000005
to very manipulate what I think causes

4178.699 --> 4182.9
the celestial lights I'm not going to be

4180.98 --> 4185.839
able to turn them off I'm pretty damn

4182.9 --> 4187.58
sure about that so there is no science

4185.839 --> 4190.219
involved

4187.58 --> 4192.259
because in order for scientific method

4190.219 --> 4195.44
to be involved you have to have a

4192.259 --> 4198.92
phenomenon that you will be able to vary

4195.44 --> 4200.599999999999
and manipulate in order to prove what's

4198.92 --> 4203.66
causing the effect

4200.6 --> 4206.06
and I can't do that nobody can we can't

4203.66 --> 4208.46
very manipulate the celestial lights we

4206.06 --> 4211.719
can only let them

4208.46 --> 4211.719
follow their course

4212.179 --> 4219.26
We Can't Stop their course we can't

4215.6 --> 4221.4800000000005
speed up their course we can't decrease

4219.26 --> 4223.820000000001
or increase their output we can't

4221.48 --> 4226.699
influence anything about the celestial

4223.82 --> 4228.38
lights it's just there and it is the way

4226.699 --> 4230.0599999999995
it is there is nothing we can do about

4228.38 --> 4232.64
it

4230.06 --> 4234.320000000001
except maybe cover it up with clouds or

4232.64 --> 4235.6990000000005
something that's the the worst we could

4234.32 --> 4238.04
do

4235.699 --> 4238.82
but that's not very manipulating it's

4238.04 --> 4241.9
just

4238.82 --> 4241.9
covering it up

4242.12 --> 4245.12
anyway

4251.96 --> 4258.46
yeah no the sun is not maybe just really

4254.48 --> 4258.459999999999
far away there is no really far away

4258.86 --> 4265.28
there's no proof that actual distances

4261.86 --> 4267.98
exist like what is clean million miles

4265.28 --> 4270.62
there is no million miles the realm is

4267.98 --> 4272.78
not a million miles there is no such

4270.62 --> 4276.5599999999995
distance

4272.78 --> 4281.5
within the physical confine of the realm

4276.56 --> 4281.5
there is no space for a million miles

4290.739 --> 4297.04
time Q celador

4294.199 --> 4297.04
I

4297.679 --> 4302.06
I how big is the realm

4299.719 --> 4304.76
well

4302.06 --> 4307.52
a few thousand miles

4304.76 --> 4310.52
the known

4307.52 --> 4315.52
realm that is because there might be

4310.52 --> 4315.52
more realm segments North and South

4315.98 --> 4321.139999999999
that we simply don't have access to or

4318.98 --> 4323.0599999999995
there isn't that much space north and

4321.14 --> 4325.159000000001
south and it will be some kind of a

4323.06 --> 4326.719
barrier but there's no proof of this

4325.159 --> 4329.0599999999995
barrier just yet

4326.719 --> 4331.699
or at least where it is there's only

4329.06 --> 4334.04
proof that there has to be a limited

4331.699 --> 4336.199
amount of volume available for the gas

4334.04 --> 4338.9
to expand into or we wouldn't have gas

4336.199 --> 4340.879999999999
pressure but we don't know exactly how

4338.9 --> 4344.78
big those confines are

4340.88 --> 4347.6
we can estimate based on the known

4344.78 --> 4350.239
knowledge we have but that's not it's

4347.6 --> 4352.64
just a basic guess

4350.239 --> 4355.82
it's an estimation based on available

4352.64 --> 4358.659000000001
information it's definitely not

4355.82 --> 4358.659
definitive

4363.5 --> 4368.659
realm unknown realm is real smaller than

4366.26 --> 4370.6990000000005
is million miles

4368.659 --> 4374.299999999999
while you're talking about the sun right

4370.699 --> 4376.699
there's no million miles above us

4374.3 --> 4379.96
I guarantee you

4376.699 --> 4379.96
there's not that height

4387.58 --> 4392.0199999999995
that there is no distance like that

4393.26 --> 4399.679
how the hell do they know that well

4396.08 --> 4402.8
because of the nature of the gradient if

4399.679 --> 4404.42
there was a million miles of space above

4402.8 --> 4406.52
us

4404.42 --> 4410.6
right

4406.52 --> 4413.84
then the gradient of gas pressure that

4410.6 --> 4417.38
is here would be different

4413.84 --> 4420.76
it would be much more stretched and even

4417.38 --> 4420.76
out than it is

4422.06 --> 4427.360000000001
because a million miles is a lot of

4425.12 --> 4427.36
distance

4428.0 --> 4434.06
I think that the actual distance to the

4430.58 --> 4438.44
flat top wherever it exactly would be is

4434.06 --> 4441.52
rather like around between a hundred

4438.44 --> 4445.48
maybe yeah somewhere around a hundred

4441.52 --> 4445.4800000000005
thousand miles or something

4448.58 --> 4453.199
around there that's what I think is more

4450.86 --> 4455.719
likely that the actual distance to the

4453.199 --> 4458.5599999999995
container is above but yeah we can't

4455.719 --> 4461.84
actually get there to confirm it because

4458.56 --> 4464.659000000001
the pressure there is so low

4461.84 --> 4466.76
due to the temperature influx of coal

4464.659 --> 4468.5599999999995
that is above it has to be otherwise

4466.76 --> 4470.6
there's no logical reason why there is

4468.56 --> 4472.76
any gradient at all

4470.6 --> 4475.52
right only temperature influence are

4472.76 --> 4479.3
proven to directly cause

4475.52 --> 4481.580000000001
a container of gas to gradiate so there

4479.3 --> 4484.0
must be a cold influence and it is cold

4481.58 --> 4484.0
up there

4484.88 --> 4491.0
but yeah if it was just very vast

4488.54 --> 4494.96
distance then

4491.0 --> 4496.699
the gradient would stretch up in

4494.96 --> 4499.1
accordance

4496.699 --> 4501.678999999999
and the layer of gas pressure on Earth

4499.1 --> 4504.38
should then be much bigger

4501.679 --> 4506.84
like the real thick air which is at

4504.38 --> 4508.46
ground level it should be much much

4506.84 --> 4511.88
further than

4508.46 --> 4515.179
because more containment space means

4511.88 --> 4517.9400000000005
more gas buildup right because all that

4515.179 --> 4521.179
space is not going to be tolerated by

4517.94 --> 4523.339999999999
nature to remain unfilled

4521.179 --> 4525.32
that nature abhors a vacuum it's gonna

4523.34 --> 4527.360000000001
get filled so if there was that giant

4525.32 --> 4530.299999999999
amount of space above us then it would

4527.36 --> 4532.82
all be filled up with gas more gas

4530.3 --> 4534.860000000001
because it has to because that room is

4532.82 --> 4537.38
there and it's gonna fill it up

4534.86 --> 4540.799999999999
and then the gradient that we have of

4537.38 --> 4543.9800000000005
the gas pressure should be much more

4540.8 --> 4545.78
stretched than it is so I'm I'm gonna go

4543.98 --> 4547.959999999999
with there's not a million miles above

4545.78 --> 4547.96
us

4566.56 --> 4572.2390000000005
acros sticks to the ground

4569.78 --> 4574.34
no it's not for some reason it's because

4572.239 --> 4577.339999999999
of temperature influence

4574.34 --> 4580.28
because there's heat at ground level

4577.34 --> 4585.62
it's the air is much thicker

4580.28 --> 4588.5
well the cold measurable cold up there

4585.62 --> 4590.8
is gonna make it thinner that's what

4588.5 --> 4590.8
happens

4591.14 --> 4595.64
when you have temperature influences

4593.06 --> 4597.4400000000005
within a contained space that's what

4595.64 --> 4599.42
happens to the material the gas is

4597.44 --> 4602.239
within it it'll start to gradiate the

4599.42 --> 4604.34
cold part will be less pressure the hot

4602.239 --> 4606.699
part will be more pressure that's how it

4604.34 --> 4606.6990000000005
works

4607.04 --> 4611.06
yeah

4609.08 --> 4613.58
temperature increases when you no not

4611.06 --> 4617.42
really Johnny

4613.58 --> 4619.96
there is a point allegedly

4617.42 --> 4623.36
where the temperature

4619.96 --> 4627.26
decreases less

4623.36 --> 4630.199
it like the it there's a part where it's

4627.26 --> 4632.659000000001
slightly less cold than the rest so

4630.199 --> 4635.599999999999
there's like an irregularity

4632.659 --> 4636.739
a non-linearity to the gradient of the

4635.6 --> 4639.320000000001
temperature

4636.739 --> 4642.379999999999
within the gas pressure

4639.32 --> 4645.44
there's a weird wobble thing where it's

4642.38 --> 4646.64
slightly warmer but then it gets colder

4645.44 --> 4649.04
again too

4646.64 --> 4652.58
and that temperature that's slightly

4649.04 --> 4655.5199999999995
warmer is still freezing it's not

4652.58 --> 4659.62
actually warm it's just slightly less

4655.52 --> 4659.620000000001
cold than what surrounds it

4670.4 --> 4674.86
cold air is denser than hot air yeah I

4672.679 --> 4674.86
know

4675.86 --> 4682.04
so what happens the cold air above goes

4679.34 --> 4685.219
down because it's more dense

4682.04 --> 4688.719
in the hot air rises up

4685.219 --> 4688.719
that's how you get weather

4689.06 --> 4695.6
and that's why it's less dense less gas

4692.78 --> 4698.659
pressure up there because it's cold

4695.6 --> 4701.06
and the hot air at ground level pushing

4698.659 --> 4703.46
against everything trying to expand

4701.06 --> 4707.320000000001
building up more pressure

4703.46 --> 4707.32
exactly what's going on hey mandio

4720.46 --> 4727.46
stop being so whiny please Johnny don't

4723.98 --> 4727.459999999999
do that anyway

4728.3 --> 4735.1990000000005
guys are you still talking about

4731.84 --> 4737.78
between space and her Admiral

4735.199 --> 4739.879999999999
right yeah there's no space

4737.78 --> 4741.62
with the claimed amount of volume

4739.88 --> 4745.04
available

4741.62 --> 4746.78
within the heliocentric Universe the gas

4745.04 --> 4750.56
pressure

4746.78 --> 4753.139999999999
would try to even out and because the

4750.56 --> 4756.080000000001
volume is so insane

4753.14 --> 4758.12
there would literally be like no gas

4756.08 --> 4760.36
whatsoever left it will all try to

4758.12 --> 4762.98
spread out evenly within the available

4760.36 --> 4765.32
astronomically sized volume of like

4762.98 --> 4768.139999999999
infinite galaxies or whatever right

4765.32 --> 4770.84
there's no way

4768.14 --> 4774.8
there would be no gas pressure here

4770.84 --> 4777.92
if the Earth was a ball in outer space

4774.8 --> 4781.64
without a barrier to separate

4777.92 --> 4784.52
the atmosphere from outer space

4781.64 --> 4786.860000000001
the gas would spread out evenly

4784.52 --> 4790.580000000001
and thus there wouldn't be any gas on

4786.86 --> 4793.339999999999
Earth there only is gas on Earth that we

4790.58 --> 4796.94
are breathing because there is a limited

4793.34 --> 4801.219
volume available for the gas to expand

4796.94 --> 4801.219
into and pressurize

4802.219 --> 4805.219
foreign

4806.58 --> 4809.729
[Music]

4835.0 --> 4841.06
I doubt it

4837.14 --> 4841.06
I don't think the North Pole is a point

4841.219 --> 4845.12
I think it's a Direction

4843.08 --> 4848.96
just as the South Pole is a direction

4845.12 --> 4852.44
because I personally think that

4848.96 --> 4855.08
I mean I don't have definitive proof for

4852.44 --> 4857.0
it but I definitely know how to attain

4855.08 --> 4858.679
that proof and I think that the realm is

4857.0 --> 4860.179
not a disc

4858.679 --> 4862.82
it's not

4860.179 --> 4865.52
a Cartesian disk

4862.82 --> 4867.62
I think it's actually rectangular it's

4865.52 --> 4869.900000000001
more like a square and there's a loop

4867.62 --> 4873.26
between east and west

4869.9 --> 4875.0
and the proof for this would be that the

4873.26 --> 4878.659000000001
equator

4875.0 --> 4881.42
would be a Cartesian euclidean perfect

4878.659 --> 4884.54
straight line because if it is

4881.42 --> 4887.2390000000005
then it's not a disc then it's not a

4884.54 --> 4890.0
circle that is part of a disk

4887.239 --> 4891.5599999999995
and I do believe that the equator is

4890.0 --> 4893.48
actually a straight line yeah you can

4891.56 --> 4896.0
call that Pac-Man Earth all you like I

4893.48 --> 4899.718999999999
call it rectangular looping because

4896.0 --> 4902.48
Pac-Man is a stupid video game and it's

4899.719 --> 4905.0
not even a good example

4902.48 --> 4908.839999999999
being a much better example would be the

4905.0 --> 4912.08
The Matrix to train man station yeah

4908.84 --> 4914.659000000001
Neo is in the train man station

4912.08 --> 4916.94
he tries to get out he goes on the rails

4914.659 --> 4919.219
and then he runs and then he ends up in

4916.94 --> 4920.36
the same train station arriving from the

4919.219 --> 4923.179
other side

4920.36 --> 4927.46
that's a much better example to compare

4923.179 --> 4927.46
the rectangular looping Earth to

4928.64 --> 4936.38
it's just connected it's a continuum

4932.12 --> 4939.5
the realm is like a wormhole

4936.38 --> 4943.64
a self-contained space that Loops in on

4939.5 --> 4945.08
itself and there is no outside of the

4943.64 --> 4949.6990000000005
loop

4945.08 --> 4951.5599999999995
like physical reality and space does not

4949.699 --> 4954.62
exist

4951.56 --> 4956.6
outside of the loop

4954.62 --> 4958.64
that's the condition

4956.6 --> 4961.46
yeah you can't have something looping

4958.64 --> 4965.02
and then have stuff be Beyond The Loop

4961.46 --> 4965.02
because it's a continuum

4972.92 --> 4977.26
so but that's all rectangular looping

4975.08 --> 4977.26
model

4977.48 --> 4982.58
it's not the universal flattered

4980.12 --> 4984.86
argumentation it's just the model that

4982.58 --> 4987.5599999999995
I've been pursuing for a long time

4984.86 --> 4991.4
because I really think it is that

4987.56 --> 4995.120000000001
and it is potentially provable I just

4991.4 --> 4997.46
explain how what is the equator is it a

4995.12 --> 4998.719
circle or is it an arc or is it a

4997.46 --> 5002.199
straight line

4998.719 --> 5004.12
the answer to that will give definitive

5002.199 --> 5006.099999999999
in negation

5004.12 --> 5011.14
what the nature of the realm is like

5006.1 --> 5014.280000000001
what the orientation of the land masses

5011.14 --> 5018.219
and how the celestials work orientate

5014.28 --> 5020.38
within the available Realm

5018.219 --> 5022.6
it's very important to know what what

5020.38 --> 5024.52
the equator is is it a straight line is

5022.6 --> 5025.360000000001
it a circle or is it something in

5024.52 --> 5028.179
between

5025.36 --> 5031.9
because if it isn't a circle

5028.179 --> 5035.4400000000005
then the realm is not a disc and the

5031.9 --> 5039.639999999999
chances of a spiritual uh sorry a

5035.44 --> 5043.78
spatial non-linear situation like a loop

5039.64 --> 5046.659000000001
Continuum is unavoidable

5043.78 --> 5050.38
either the equator is a circle

5046.659 --> 5053.5
or we are not living in a place that is

5050.38 --> 5057.52
just potentially endless

5053.5 --> 5061.42
if the equator is not a circle then the

5057.52 --> 5065.280000000001
chances of us living in a continuum

5061.42 --> 5065.28
is 100 percent

5067.48 --> 5073.9
100 100 percent

5070.719 --> 5076.0
and it is physically testable within the

5073.9 --> 5078.219
realm whether that is the case or not

5076.0 --> 5081.4
yeah I'd like to see somebody else

5078.219 --> 5084.4
suggest a model that is physically

5081.4 --> 5085.78
provable to be wrong or Inc or right

5084.4 --> 5088.239
right

5085.78 --> 5090.639999999999
I'm the one that came up with that I'm

5088.239 --> 5094.0
the one that figured that out in 2016

5090.64 --> 5097.659000000001
already this falsifiability I figured

5094.0 --> 5097.659
that out in 2016.

5100.14 --> 5105.219
when people were just still not

5103.06 --> 5110.34
understanding and laughing at me for one

5105.219 --> 5113.4
looping oh you're crazy oh it's a disco

5110.34 --> 5116.5
magnetism it has to be disciplined

5113.4 --> 5119.139999999999
that's [ __ ] physicality assumption bias

5116.5 --> 5123.179
disc earthers

5119.14 --> 5123.179
I had to deal with that from the start

5123.52 --> 5126.96
hey Dan good to see you

5130.239 --> 5136.0599999999995
remember that on Sunday oh wow

5133.3 --> 5137.26
that's a long time ago in time Q seller

5136.06 --> 5139.900000000001
celador

5137.26 --> 5142.3
that's a long time ago

5139.9 --> 5145.44
that's like before flatter that's before

5142.3 --> 5145.4400000000005
flat of early bird

5148.8 --> 5154.26
I like Antonio subrancis map yeah

5155.679 --> 5158.82
but it's still disc

5160.9 --> 5167.339999999999
Mobius strip equator model

5164.02 --> 5167.34
yeah but it doesn't work

5168.96 --> 5177.4
sadugaki you see Mobius only works

5173.62 --> 5179.88
when there's a curve a concave curve and

5177.4 --> 5179.879999999999
there isn't

5182.38 --> 5187.179
if it's not curved then it's not a

5184.48 --> 5189.159
Mobius strip because then there would be

5187.179 --> 5191.5
no spin nothing

5189.159 --> 5194.379999999999
yeah a Mobius trip would have been the

5191.5 --> 5196.84
only potential concave model that would

5194.38 --> 5199.84
have would have halfway worked

5196.84 --> 5205.0
but guess what it's not concave there's

5199.84 --> 5206.5
no curvatures it's dead reckoning flat

5205.0 --> 5209.02
no curve

5206.5 --> 5212.58
so it's not a Mobius strip because it's

5209.02 --> 5212.580000000001
dead straight flat

5217.37 --> 5220.599999999999
[Music]

5219.04 --> 5223.179
unless we're on the outside yeah but

5220.6 --> 5225.820000000001
we're not and it wouldn't work like

5223.179 --> 5228.34
there is no outside on a Mobius strip

5225.82 --> 5231.82
right unless you think

5228.34 --> 5234.400000000001
there is the outer space heliocentric

5231.82 --> 5235.299999999999
Universe on the outside of the Mobius

5234.4 --> 5238.719
strip

5235.3 --> 5242.1990000000005
but then you'd have to deal with the

5238.719 --> 5245.08
natural law violating heliocentric Outer

5242.199 --> 5247.48
Space Universe which definitely isn't

5245.08 --> 5251.159
real cannot be real

5247.48 --> 5251.159
so not an option

5258.28 --> 5262.42
yeah straight line returns back on

5260.08 --> 5264.4
itself it's a continuum

5262.42 --> 5267.2390000000005
like the train man station from The

5264.4 --> 5267.239
Matrix 2.

5267.28 --> 5273.5199999999995
own contained space outside of it

5270.639 --> 5276.76
nothing exists

5273.52 --> 5279.46
like the train man station was not right

5276.76 --> 5283.179
next to the city Matrix

5279.46 --> 5287.639
it's its own continuum as it exists

5283.179 --> 5287.639
nothing else physically exists

5287.92 --> 5293.08
you'd have to

5289.6 --> 5295.4800000000005
go out of it and then into another

5293.08 --> 5297.639
continuum

5295.48 --> 5300.94
somehow in The Matrix that happens you

5297.639 --> 5303.219
download you upload right

5300.94 --> 5305.379999999999
and that's why that's more logically

5303.219 --> 5309.52
functional there

5305.38 --> 5311.56
but we're not uploaded like that we are

5309.52 --> 5314.8
actually physically physical beings

5311.56 --> 5318.820000000001
seated by Spirits within this Continuum

5314.8 --> 5320.62
there is no physical reality outside of

5318.82 --> 5323.62
the continuum

5320.62 --> 5324.88
there is only physical reality within

5323.62 --> 5327.4
the continuum

5324.88 --> 5329.679
there is nothing outside no space not

5327.4 --> 5332.08
available space no matter no energy

5329.679 --> 5335.679
nothing there's only

5332.08 --> 5338.08
the Continuum and the physical nature

5335.679 --> 5340.36
within it

5338.08 --> 5342.659
and our spirits of course which are not

5340.36 --> 5342.659
physical

5345.639 --> 5350.32
but arguably energy based so to a degree

5348.159 --> 5352.98
they are physical

5350.32 --> 5352.98
but yeah

5356.56 --> 5360.9400000000005
yeah right so man I've got such an

5358.659 --> 5362.5599999999995
active chat today

5360.94 --> 5365.739
this is great

5362.56 --> 5367.96
it's great to have you all here

5365.739 --> 5370.299999999999
I don't know all of you too well just

5367.96 --> 5373.38
yet but I really appreciate all this

5370.3 --> 5375.6990000000005
genuine curiosity

5373.38 --> 5379.32
and just wanted to say where the hell

5375.699 --> 5379.32
have you been these last few years

5383.08 --> 5389.8
does God reside within the realm no

5386.56 --> 5392.620000000001
he created it he's arguing arguably

5389.8 --> 5394.900000000001
keeping it together he's not a part of

5392.62 --> 5397.179
the realm nor is he physical

5394.9 --> 5398.94
in any way

5397.179 --> 5403.36
and

5398.94 --> 5405.4
I am strongly convinced that no man

5403.36 --> 5407.259999999999
shall be God there's no

5405.4 --> 5408.638999999999
entry

5407.26 --> 5411.2390000000005
no

5408.639 --> 5414.159000000001
unified personified

5411.239 --> 5416.62
isolated entity that's going to be God

5414.159 --> 5418.48
within the realm it's illogical

5416.62 --> 5421.3
he's literally keeping the realm

5418.48 --> 5424.659
together he's not going to be the

5421.3 --> 5427.360000000001
programmer that then literally becomes a

5424.659 --> 5429.96
game character within the program that's

5427.36 --> 5429.96
not gonna happen

5438.34 --> 5442.900000000001
what

5439.42 --> 5446.139
is the equator East West yes

5442.9 --> 5448.08
that's how it's defined like the equator

5446.139 --> 5451.84
is

5448.08 --> 5453.88
exactly in the middle of east to west

5451.84 --> 5455.92
Celestial motion

5453.88 --> 5458.7390000000005
it's where the sun is at his height

5455.92 --> 5461.139
highest on average

5458.739 --> 5463.239
that's the equator it's a Celestial

5461.139 --> 5465.28
derived

5463.239 --> 5468.099999999999
Place basically

5465.28 --> 5470.94
a line that celestially derived from the

5468.1 --> 5470.9400000000005
Sun positions

5472.179 --> 5478.84
over the Earth

5475.06 --> 5482.639
and it is diff like East and West are

5478.84 --> 5482.639
defined by it basically

5482.92 --> 5487.3
right

5484.9 --> 5490.12
Equator was from east to west and it's

5487.3 --> 5492.28
exactly in the middle of it all

5490.12 --> 5493.78
where the sun is at its highest on

5492.28 --> 5496.3
average

5493.78 --> 5499.0
that's where the equator is

5496.3 --> 5501.34
and I don't know what it is like is it a

5499.0 --> 5504.1
straight line is it a circle what is it

5501.34 --> 5506.32
really I still don't know there's all

5504.1 --> 5509.26
these suggestions and there's no actual

5506.32 --> 5511.299999999999
measured evidence it's really confusing

5509.26 --> 5513.219
actually that there's no measured

5511.3 --> 5515.320000000001
evidence like why isn't there any

5513.219 --> 5517.54
measured evidence only these Mac

5515.32 --> 5520.78
projections but guess what map

5517.54 --> 5522.639
projections Ben thinks you can make a

5520.78 --> 5524.98
straight you can have a straight map

5522.639 --> 5527.56
projection and then bend it into that

5524.98 --> 5530.138999999999
circle thing but does that make the

5527.56 --> 5532.120000000001
equator an actual Circle or isn't it

5530.139 --> 5534.82
which one is it you don't know because

5532.12 --> 5537.159
it's a projection and projection warps

5534.82 --> 5540.5199999999995
things

5537.159 --> 5544.42
you can show things in a projection

5540.52 --> 5549.040000000001
as they are not really in reality you

5544.42 --> 5552.9
see projection warps the things

5549.04 --> 5552.9
because of the nature of the projection

5563.26 --> 5566.679
yeah that's right gamer guy married

5565.239 --> 5569.218999999999
Super Mario could never meet the

5566.679 --> 5569.219
developer

5573.46 --> 5580.36
right the developer is simply God to

5577.06 --> 5583.84
Mario it's like yeah he created me

5580.36 --> 5586.0
I'm not gonna expect to actually

5583.84 --> 5588.1
see him

5586.0 --> 5591.04
within his Incarnation although Mario

5588.1 --> 5593.7390000000005
might if he has the faculties within the

5591.04 --> 5594.94
program might believe that he might one

5593.739 --> 5598.839999999999
day

5594.94 --> 5600.58
die and then meet his maker

5598.84 --> 5603.360000000001
you can be in heaven together with the

5600.58 --> 5603.36
Miyamoto

5603.52 --> 5610.7390000000005
right but I mean that's just yeah

5607.54 --> 5610.739
I think you get it

5622.36 --> 5630.299999999999
was Skyping neutering that's uh that's

5626.139 --> 5630.3
Nathan throwing out a Google Plus link

5635.34 --> 5641.4400000000005
right man the time has flown today was a

5639.52 --> 5642.639
great show though even though I'm really

5641.44 --> 5645.339999999999
