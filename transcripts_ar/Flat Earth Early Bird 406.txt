111.05 --> 114.8
lot so thank you so much Julie Bennett

113.27 --> 117.44
for being basically the primary

114.8 --> 122.84
contributor there's also others of

117.44 --> 124.369
course alright so yeah sorry for being a

122.84 --> 129.049
little bit late I got stuck upon

124.369 --> 133.78
watching the the the B stream from

129.049 --> 141.85
yesterday oh yeah from in the evening

133.78 --> 145.22
Karen be going over yeah Mike Adams this

141.85 --> 150.68
baller Schilling on Infowars which yeah

145.22 --> 152.72
he is like going way over the top he has

150.68 --> 156.98000000000002
been for some time I followed him and I

152.72 --> 160.85
I thought it was kind of painful like in

156.98 --> 167.73899999999998
on one hand I I kind of do like how he

160.85 --> 169.91
thinks but yeah he's he's not properly

167.739 --> 173.06
setting the framework as in

169.91 --> 176.269
presuppositional so he is basically just

173.06 --> 179.45
declaring things out right and yeah

176.269 --> 184.489
deluding his audience doing it and

179.45 --> 188.83999999999997
that's very sad but I do like his ideas

184.489 --> 191.959
like I like his constructive mind

188.84 --> 195.23
concerning globe machinations Isis

191.959 --> 199.189
sorry because I think of these things

195.23 --> 202.54899999999998
myself and I kind of thought that some

199.189 --> 209.03
of his ideas were very smart and found

202.549 --> 218.9
it but smart but yeah I get it it is it

209.03 --> 220.969
is globe shilling absolutely about

218.9 --> 223.639
anyway if you're a default baller and

220.969 --> 227.299
you want to get healthy then go over to

223.639 --> 229.87900000000002
natural news.com because that guy

227.299 --> 233.45000000000002
certainly has some real globe space safe

229.879 --> 236.56
space in Gurgaon and you can yeah I

233.45 --> 241.31
still think most of his health

236.56 --> 244.79
information is very useful in it's not

241.31 --> 248.45
super consistent in the sense that yeah

244.79 --> 252.16899999999998
he just puts down research data on a

248.45 --> 254.599
certain level and it's a good level it's

252.169 --> 257.329
a good range of information I've always

254.599 --> 261.979
found it very helpful like over the last

257.329 --> 266.93
20 years or something but he is just a

261.979 --> 269.479
total globe like fanatically so for flat

266.93 --> 276.409
earthers is gonna be quite annoying at

269.479 --> 277.13
times do I have the list of housekeeping

276.409 --> 280.01
questions

277.13 --> 282.86
Earvin Johnson well I don't need a list

280.01 --> 285.21999999999997
I know it by heart now it's not that

282.86 --> 285.22
difficult

287.85 --> 294.22
first there's the evidence of earth

290.08 --> 301.0
curvature then there see suppose

294.22 --> 305.22
evidence of axial rotation viable

301.0 --> 308.22
hypothesis concerning astronomy

305.22 --> 308.22
astrophysics

309.18 --> 319.36
yeah and that and there's the evidence

313.81 --> 323.58
for gravity scientific evidence for

319.36 --> 323.58000000000004
gravity gas pressure without a container

323.94 --> 337.45
distance to the Sun oh yeah and the

330.7 --> 339.96999999999997
evidence of the r-value of course so

337.45 --> 348.01
yeah that that should be it as far as I

339.97 --> 350.31
remember all this did I miss one Avignon

348.01 --> 350.31
sense

358.33 --> 364.029
what seriously PTSD what

373.12 --> 377.8
yeah sorry I can't help you with that

378.67 --> 383.96000000000004
look if you've truly been a longtime

382.01 --> 390.74
listener then you should know that I do

383.96 --> 392.51
that constantly so yeah I'm not gonna

390.74 --> 395.06
mute my mic every time I take a sip of

392.51 --> 403.15999999999997
tea it's unfortunately just a part of

395.06 --> 407.26
what I do I try not to be as noisy as I

403.16 --> 407.26000000000005
can but yeah sorry

410.57 --> 413.8
[Music]

416.34 --> 421.95
oh really well how have you managed to

418.89 --> 427.28999999999996
sit through my show then for so long

421.95 --> 428.03999999999996
because I sip tea constantly it's even

427.29 --> 429.96000000000004
like a Mema

428.04 --> 432.03000000000003
how could you bear to listen to my show

429.96 --> 435.81
because I constantly do that so that

432.03 --> 439.77
seems kind of odd that you would tell me

435.81 --> 444.09
this now after before revealing to be a

439.77 --> 446.47999999999996
longtime listener find this very odd to

444.09 --> 446.47999999999996
say the least

456.1 --> 463.379
[Music]

465.98 --> 472.79
yeah because I know there's look I'm not

470.24 --> 481.22
saying that you're not a real person I

472.79 --> 484.34000000000003
don't know I don't know if that's real

481.22 --> 488.66
then I'm sorry to hear that but yeah I

484.34 --> 491.81
am being targeted by certain types of

488.66 --> 494.78000000000003
individuals that create fake people

491.81 --> 499.1
towards me specifically to try and see

494.78 --> 502.72999999999996
if they can make me force make me force

499.1 --> 505.76000000000005
to change some of my habits anything any

502.73 --> 508.93
little detail they want to see that

505.76 --> 513.65
there is some way to make me change

508.93 --> 520.07
except by my own choice to make to see

513.65 --> 522.05
me micro [ __ ] and I can feel this and I

520.07 --> 524.09
don't even know sometimes sometimes I

522.05 --> 527.7199999999999
mistake this behavior in people so I

524.09 --> 529.61
don't know whether it is them or it is

527.72 --> 533.0
just something that happens to catch

529.61 --> 536.9
people but I've become quite paranoid at

533.0 --> 540.89
it so yeah it's a general thing I do not

536.9 --> 544.4599999999999
change my behavior I don't

540.89 --> 549.68
I only change it if I see that like this

544.46 --> 552.2800000000001
is something that I do is like bad on

549.68 --> 552.28
the long run

558.38 --> 566.06
all right I'm sorry Karen like it that

562.58 --> 568.49
could be real but yeah if I'm gonna get

566.06 --> 570.41
a lot of people just saying oh you got

568.49 --> 572.84
to stop doing this because I'll go

570.41 --> 575.9599999999999
insane or something then yeah that's

572.84 --> 577.94
exactly what will keep on coming until

575.96 --> 581.1700000000001
there's nothing left I can do and I've

577.94 --> 584.74
turned into a media of robot trying to

581.17 --> 587.42
protect everybody safe space see I

584.74 --> 596.23
understand what's going on on the wide

587.42 --> 599.9599999999999
run and yeah I feel very comfortable

596.23 --> 603.22
just having my tea drinking it not

599.96 --> 605.96
muting because also my mute button is

603.22 --> 608.6600000000001
can be quite the hassle it's not as

605.96 --> 611.09
reliable as I want it to be and it's

608.66 --> 615.65
happened many times that I thought i

611.09 --> 616.01
unmuted and then for a long period you

615.65 --> 620.12
know

616.01 --> 625.46
I suddenly I'm talking nobody's hearing

620.12 --> 626.93
me so I'm sorry but yeah our weddings

625.46 --> 630.1600000000001
going to be drinking tea I'm gonna take

626.93 --> 630.16
a sip right now so

633.84 --> 638.87
I usually only slurp a little when it's

636.24 --> 638.87
kind of too hot

645.17 --> 651.029
you don't have two caps that towards

648.69 --> 654.95
good good servant look I I'm not saying

651.029 --> 657.06
that she is fake I'm just saying that

654.95 --> 663.8290000000001
whether it is real or not

657.06 --> 666.959
I can't abide to that I'm sorry it's

663.829 --> 669.4499999999999
it's little too much so don't get all

666.959 --> 672.329
harsh on Karen Cox you know don't don't

669.45 --> 678.269
let my paranoia rub off on you I'm just

672.329 --> 680.37
putting down why the decision it's

678.269 --> 681.54
pretty weird though I didn't know like

680.37 --> 683.64
never heard of that

681.54 --> 690.39
people getting PTSD trigger from

683.64 --> 693.779
slurping that's quite bizarre how would

690.39 --> 698.25
that happen how would that what's

693.779 --> 700.019
typical slurping like I don't know I can

698.25 --> 703.38
imagine that that will work is if you

700.019 --> 706.62
had it you'd be like severely bullied or

703.38 --> 708.47
tortured by a specific individual like

706.62 --> 711.269
personally and you couldn't get away

708.47 --> 714.1800000000001
like you were in the same room and they

711.269 --> 717.529
would be slurping tea in the tense

714.18 --> 720.06
moments to kind of like make it into a

717.529 --> 722.329
Pavlovian reaction that's the only way I

720.06 --> 725.88
can imagine that people could have PTSD

722.329 --> 729.529
reactions to slurping but it might just

725.88 --> 731.9399999999999
be I don't know maybe it's even the

729.529 --> 734.3389999999999
association of water or something odd I

731.94 --> 736.82
don't know PTSD can work in warth way

734.339 --> 736.82
sometime

738.73 --> 746.1800000000001
yeah Karen Cox yeah I'm sorry if it's

742.91 --> 747.41
really real I'm sorry that I can't adapt

746.18 --> 754.0699999999999
to that it's too much

747.41 --> 758.51
you know I drink tea and I really do

754.07 --> 762.61
kind of need to drink stuff also because

758.51 --> 765.08
it keeps me keeps me going

762.61 --> 769.88
I've always been a tea drinker all my

765.08 --> 772.76
life and then I switched from the darker

769.88 --> 775.15
teas usually Earl Grey I love that the

772.76 --> 777.92
entire family my brother loves Earl Grey

775.15 --> 781.1899999999999
but that I figured out that black tea is

777.92 --> 786.92
not super healthy so I switched to green

781.19 --> 789.73
tea instead yeah done that all

786.92 --> 789.7299999999999
throughout my life

797.62 --> 804.8
epileptic fits man that's creepy well

801.86 --> 808.19
Karen [ __ ] eye IRA if you have any kind

804.8 --> 815.15
of epileptic affect I'd recommend you

808.19 --> 819.59
use CBD oil just if you have any kind of

815.15 --> 822.47
app epilepsy regard while however that

819.59 --> 825.83
comes to being if you're using CBD oil

822.47 --> 830.12
and doesn't have any tea it doesn't have

825.83 --> 834.7700000000001
to have THC in it then yeah that would

830.12 --> 841.34
probably completely negate the epileptic

834.77 --> 843.65
effects the epileptic responses for very

841.34 --> 848.1800000000001
dramatic results from that so maybe that

843.65 --> 853.0699999999999
is a solution it's I would think it's

848.18 --> 855.7299999999999
worth a try at least although I'd

853.07 --> 859.37
probably if you're in the medical

855.73 --> 861.47
profession I would ask like the

859.37 --> 867.5600000000001
superiors or whatever like is this okay

861.47 --> 869.27
is this can I do this without giving

867.56 --> 871.0699999999999
into some kind of trouble because they

869.27 --> 873.68
might see it as a drug or something so

871.07 --> 876.5
be careful with that I don't know how

873.68 --> 878.5999999999999
strict the medical profession approach

876.5 --> 886.82
is that kind of thing these days I have

878.6 --> 892.1
no idea but anyway mmm man a lot of

886.82 --> 894.2600000000001
people in chat yeah I've been hearing

892.1 --> 897.01
that Australia some pretty bad forest

894.26 --> 897.01
fires right now

904.21 --> 910.96
yes Karen Cox I I yeah I'm not a doctor

908.26 --> 913.66
like not I don't have a degree I

910.96 --> 919.99
consider myself my own doctor what I

913.66 --> 921.8199999999999
would actually recommend it but do be

919.99 --> 923.89
careful I don't know if you're on to

921.82 --> 928.45
other types of medication or

923.89 --> 931.72
pharmaceuticals because yeah other

928.45 --> 934.51
things may give some kind of side

931.72 --> 937.57
response you don't know but as a

934.51 --> 941.38
self-standing product for taking kind of

937.57 --> 944.1400000000001
CBD oil is it's quite safe and reliable

941.38 --> 946.5889999999999
so I would definitely recommend trying

944.14 --> 946.5889999999999
it out

947.55 --> 956.68
now I've not seen The Witcher on Netflix

950.8 --> 960.2199999999999
I don't care - very annoyed I hate the

956.68 --> 963.6099999999999
game I hate the character he's just

960.22 --> 966.899
freaking annoying Brodie little gamma

963.61 --> 966.899
[ __ ] I hate him

973.63 --> 980.42
and by the way the same goes for a lot

977.45 --> 984.7700000000001
of typical gaming characters that have

980.42 --> 987.61
come about I can't stand him they're

984.77 --> 987.61
super annoying

1002.829 --> 1010.5999999999999
yeah my show is all over the place I

1005.75 --> 1010.6
know that can be sometime

1018.77 --> 1023.97
yes they didn't have any alcohol right

1021.27 --> 1025.25
away and in retrospect that felt really

1023.97 --> 1030.54
good

1025.25 --> 1040.02
I'm gonna leave it alone all right yeah

1030.54 --> 1041.37
at least I think I'll try I've been

1040.02 --> 1043.05
saying it for a long time but it's

1041.37 --> 1045.9199999999998
sometimes difficult to step away from

1043.05 --> 1045.9199999999998
habit wise

1051.87 --> 1058.62
all right yeah mark colored well it all

1056.94 --> 1061.38
depends on what you're gonna use it for

1058.62 --> 1063.7099999999998
I just kind of use Netflix to watch old

1061.38 --> 1067.38
familiar series that I like and

1063.71 --> 1070.08
sometimes try out new stuff but it

1067.38 --> 1071.909
doesn't stick the older stuff sticks

1070.08 --> 1074.6899999999998
much better because the new stuff is

1071.909 --> 1079.74
just too polluted too annoying

1074.69 --> 1082.8600000000001
like even the good things and so very

1079.74 --> 1085.6490000000001
beautiful and very heavy stuff and

1082.86 --> 1087.83
intense but it's also just out of whack

1085.649 --> 1092.279
everything all the characters are all

1087.83 --> 1099.59
shitty in some way or just not as good

1092.279 --> 1103.35
as they could have been and I don't like

1099.59 --> 1105.57
watching new series very hesitant to try

1103.35 --> 1107.85
out new stuff at first when I joined

1105.57 --> 1110.85
Netflix I was kind of like okay I'm just

1107.85 --> 1112.7099999999998
gonna dig around what level of sci-fi is

1110.85 --> 1116.07
out there but it's more like trying to

1112.71 --> 1118.6200000000001
get a feel for what's around in certain

1116.07 --> 1123.27
places rather that I was genuinely

1118.62 --> 1125.61
interested in like oh this is a great

1123.27 --> 1127.74
new series because yeah most of them

1125.61 --> 1131.37
were kind of cool look at that's it it's

1127.74 --> 1133.6200000000001
all like that's kind of cool oh this

1131.37 --> 1140.039
moment was cool that moment was kind of

1133.62 --> 1142.4699999999998
cool but yeah after you get through

1140.039 --> 1145.83
through a few of these series things

1142.47 --> 1148.44
start to because they start to look kind

1145.83 --> 1153.96
of bland because a lot is very much the

1148.44 --> 1157.169
same on the same level now there's so

1153.96 --> 1159.299
much out there that because of this

1157.169 --> 1161.7
there's a lot that I'm missing but I'm

1159.299 --> 1165.95
just not willing to sift through all of

1161.7 --> 1165.95
it because of all the pollution

1169.66 --> 1176.47
synthetic CVD was a and I don't

1172.4 --> 1176.47
recommend synthetics a CBD

1187.68 --> 1193.2
all right yeah tiny one but I did see

1189.9 --> 1197.7800000000002
stranger things and yeah I do find it

1193.2 --> 1204.21
very very cool I like the atmosphere

1197.78 --> 1211.95
it's just it's what's it's like Stephen

1204.21 --> 1215.13
King style done properly and yeah for

1211.95 --> 1218.82
all the the the weird little gravel

1215.13 --> 1222.0900000000001
details that are in there like I still

1218.82 --> 1225.24
yeah that type some of those movies and

1222.09 --> 1229.05
series they had that style does appeal

1225.24 --> 1232.19
to me good and you know why because when

1229.05 --> 1237.44
I was real young kid I had a lot of

1232.19 --> 1241.38
fantastical experiences and so that just

1237.44 --> 1243.8700000000001
yeah it works well that kind of thing

1241.38 --> 1247.2
and especially yeah did a whole dark

1243.87 --> 1250.59
world situation that was just like oh

1247.2 --> 1256.68
yeah even my experience were not like

1250.59 --> 1260.55
that but it's like the the weirdness the

1256.68 --> 1263.73
freakiness of the dark world there it

1260.55 --> 1265.62
was more symbolic because in my

1263.73 --> 1267.51
experience it was just purely that

1265.62 --> 1272.1
feeling but didn't things didn't

1267.51 --> 1275.7
physically look like that see it was

1272.1 --> 1277.83
much more covered up but the feelings

1275.7 --> 1281.45
were all there so that's yeah I like

1277.83 --> 1281.4499999999998
that series it's very interesting

1287.42 --> 1290.66
[Music]

1291.8 --> 1298.48

now I might be doubling is a lot of chat

1380.43 --> 1386.75
activity after that that's why you

1384.42 --> 1391.5900000000001
should do this at the start of the show

1386.75 --> 1401.87

1518.309 --> 1523.559
senator woods it's gonna be a long day

1521.23 --> 1523.559
why

1534.19 --> 1537.339
[Music]

1542.62 --> 1545.4289999999999
hmm

1569.63 --> 1572.44
really

1612.71 --> 1624.69
anyway yeah getting a little lost here

1615.869 --> 1628.08
in chat we subjects so is there anything

1624.69 --> 1630.6490000000001
you guys want me to discuss we got any

1628.08 --> 1630.649
questions

1653.52 --> 1659.67
what a weird thing to say Karen Cox you

1658.05 --> 1662.34
like Game of Thrones but you would have

1659.67 --> 1664.429
preferred a PG version well isn't that

1662.34 --> 1668.1899999999998
wasn't that the whole point of the thing

1664.429 --> 1672.41
about everything being like brutally

1668.19 --> 1679.92
honest and brutally real ruthless oh

1672.41 --> 1682.44
that's not PG what do you think it's

1679.92 --> 1684.15
just like all the sex scenes or whatever

1682.44 --> 1686.04
could be taken out that it would be

1684.15 --> 1689.27
suitable for children to watch I don't

1686.04 --> 1696.72
think so not even with their parents

1689.27 --> 1700.41
it's brutal it's way too harsh it's

1696.72 --> 1702.99
definitely an adult series now of course

1700.41 --> 1704.8200000000002
Oh kids like oh my god that means that I

1702.99 --> 1707.01
have to watch it and get it because

1704.82 --> 1710.76
otherwise I'm not an adult yeah that's

1707.01 --> 1712.14
just freaking great but that kids are

1710.76 --> 1715.17
always gonna be that stupid

1712.14 --> 1718.6100000000001
but things but they'll figure it out

1715.17 --> 1721.26
like the first time like this great

1718.61 --> 1723.54
egregious injustice [ __ ] starts to

1721.26 --> 1725.67
happen and people first people start to

1723.54 --> 1729.08
die that you really love yeah then I'll

1725.67 --> 1732.39
think twice about continue watching I

1729.08 --> 1735.57
did I thought like that sucked so much I

1732.39 --> 1739.5500000000002
just [ __ ] this series it took me like

1735.57 --> 1739.55
a month before I started watching again

1741.85 --> 1749.3799999999999
yeah yeah don't forget about that people

1746.74 --> 1751.96
yeah the later parts are like you get

1749.38 --> 1756.25
used to it and it's more grandiose and

1751.96 --> 1766.289
interesting and but yeah it don't forget

1756.25 --> 1766.289
about the first parts yeah

1791.01 --> 1797.929
Wow are you having this back and forth

1794.669 --> 1797.929
about this nonsense

1824.81 --> 1829.72
hmm okay Marco that's a good question

1827.69 --> 1833.48
how bad is the fluoride in the water it

1829.72 --> 1835.13
is it able to be counted are the effects

1833.48 --> 1838.16
permanent or do they go away if you

1835.13 --> 1841.16
abstain from drinking it yeah those are

1838.16 --> 1844.8200000000002
all good questions detailed questions

1841.16 --> 1846.5900000000001
yeah fluoridation water is very bad it's

1844.82 --> 1849.1699999999998
universally bad because it is

1846.59 --> 1853.49
technically a rat poison and it it is a

1849.17 --> 1856.52
detriment to everything to all life even

1853.49 --> 1858.59
in micro dosages because yeah that's

1856.52 --> 1861.05
gonna end up in the freakin ocean that

1858.59 --> 1862.97
poison is eventually going to end up in

1861.05 --> 1867.23
the groundwater or in the river in the

1862.97 --> 1869.69
ocean it's just bad always be against

1867.23 --> 1873.6200000000001
water fluoridation always no matter what

1869.69 --> 1878.45
there's no justifiable reason except for

1873.62 --> 1882.6499999999999
demo site or just weakening the public

1878.45 --> 1886.82
or at some public to do that but yeah

1882.65 --> 1888.41
what what are the effects it's the next

1886.82 --> 1891.29
question yeah is it able to be caught

1888.41 --> 1893.3300000000002
yeah you can counter it you can ensure

1891.29 --> 1896.33
that the county or whatever is in

1893.33 --> 1898.4299999999998
control of the water system that comes

1896.33 --> 1902.33
out of your tap or whatever that they

1898.43 --> 1904.19
absolutely do not do it get it out

1902.33 --> 1907.79
inform them inform them of what it

1904.19 --> 1910.22
actually is and make sure that any

1907.79 --> 1912.98
corruption that allows that to persist

1910.22 --> 1914.8
despite everyone wanting it to get out

1912.98 --> 1917.33
of it that all gets tackled

1914.8 --> 1919.6699999999998
yeah it's problematic in some regions

1917.33 --> 1921.56
but I've heard that a lot of counties in

1919.67 --> 1923.66
the United States they had fluoridated

1921.56 --> 1925.9099999999999
water and then public became aware of it

1923.66 --> 1930.53
and really forced it out so there is

1925.91 --> 1932.63
some good changes as for the effects yes

1930.53 --> 1938.12
it there are some serious effects it's

1932.63 --> 1942.92
very bad for your organs overall gives

1938.12 --> 1946.1299999999999
bone problems and the one of the the

1942.92 --> 1947.99
more fascinating interesting side

1946.13 --> 1950.8400000000001
effects is that it can suffice the

1947.99 --> 1955.19
pineal gland over time and that makes

1950.84 --> 1958.01
you unable to connect like it it

1955.19 --> 1958.46
literally dims the the ethereal the

1958.01 --> 1962.15
subtle

1958.46 --> 1966.4
senses the intuitional senses numbs you

1962.15 --> 1966.4
down effectively when it is calcified

1970.78 --> 1976.21
but yet that can be undone if you just

1975.41 --> 1978.8600000000001
stop it

1976.21 --> 1982.19
like don't you slowly that the

1978.86 --> 1984.6699999999998
toothpaste either that doesn't help the

1982.19 --> 1987.53
combination especially doesn't help but

1984.67 --> 1992.42
taking fluoride will aggravate any type

1987.53 --> 1996.3799999999999
of other things you take it is like a

1992.42 --> 1998.8700000000001
toxic enhancer overall so if you take

1996.38 --> 2002.74
pharmaceuticals on top of that yeah bad

1998.87 --> 2005.52
bad news but yeah you can get rid of it

2002.74 --> 2010.06
it once you stop the source of it and

2005.52 --> 2013.15
then you can it it usually takes some

2010.06 --> 2014.8
time you need to counteract the best way

2013.15 --> 2019.15
to counteract the poison is to get

2014.8 --> 2021.97
iodine rich substances so that can be

2019.15 --> 2024.16
just basic help iodine it'll do some

2021.97 --> 2028.05
good but yeah the best way is to get

2024.16 --> 2031.1200000000001
pure iodine and that rapidly D calcifies

2028.05 --> 2034.84
the pineal gland and you'll notice your

2031.12 --> 2039.4299999999998
sense is getting woken up well I have

2034.84 --> 2042.61
when I started taking that stuff it

2039.43 --> 2045.97
really works so you can definitely

2042.61 --> 2049.87
counteract it I hope that answers the

2045.97 --> 2056.05
question does it cost your term memory

2049.87 --> 2061.96
loss well if your pineal gland is very

2056.05 --> 2069.1200000000003
calcified then that might be a side

2061.96 --> 2069.12
effect like unstable memory I don't know

2071.849 --> 2074.849
right

2075.98 --> 2081.839
I'll be careful though if you are

2078.419 --> 2083.609
definitely calcified like that if you

2081.839 --> 2085.44
have been subjected to fluoride and

2083.609 --> 2087.8089999999997
you're going to take iodine the first

2085.44 --> 2090.659
few times it's gonna have a dramatic

2087.809 --> 2095.0690000000004
impact you might become like sick and

2090.659 --> 2099.4500000000003
start to like your body will start to

2095.069 --> 2102.0299999999997
eject all kinds of disgusting stuff it

2099.45 --> 2105.39
may be very freaky at first if you yeah

2102.03 --> 2108.059
if you're but if you're if it wasn't

2105.39 --> 2110.0989999999997
that bad and you already had regular

2108.059 --> 2112.349
intakes of iodine through your regular

2110.099 --> 2114.54
food or whatever then it may not be that

2112.349 --> 2118.1400000000003
dramatic but there's always like the

2114.54 --> 2120.54
first few days or the first week that

2118.14 --> 2122.49
you ever try it it's gonna have it's

2120.54 --> 2124.71
likely to have somewhat of a dramatic

2122.49 --> 2128.4599999999996
effect not dangerous but still dramatic

2124.71 --> 2130.7400000000002
you may become kind of sick from it but

2128.46 --> 2133.65
after that and then that goes away and

2130.74 --> 2138.74
yeah as long as you stay keep away from

2133.65 --> 2141.9300000000003
fluoridated stuff things will be fine

2138.74 --> 2144.2099999999996
and you don't yeah you don't necessarily

2141.93 --> 2148.3999999999996
even need to take iodine on a regular

2144.21 --> 2154.7
basis may help you some but you don't

2148.4 --> 2154.7000000000003
necessary so I hope that helps

2160.31 --> 2167.15
but I personally used nascent iodine

2163.4 --> 2170.6600000000003
which is like a special process where

2167.15 --> 2173.63
it's the pure iodine crystal ref purely

2170.66 --> 2176.42
refined iodine crystal from industrial

2173.63 --> 2182.36
sources from oil industry refinery

2176.42 --> 2186.9700000000003
I think dig it up and then they dissolve

2182.36 --> 2191.1200000000003
it in some kind of coconut oil like

2186.97 --> 2193.31
thing and it works really well because

2191.12 --> 2198.79
iodine pure iodine and usually

2193.31 --> 2203.33
evaporates by itself it's very fluid

2198.79 --> 2205.94
doesn't like to stay solid but it yeah

2203.33 --> 2208.97
when you dissolve it like that it stays

2205.94 --> 2214.46
pretty it stays as it is and it is very

2208.97 --> 2216.7999999999997
absorbable by the body originally I

2214.46 --> 2221.6
think that like Alex Jones had the first

2216.8 --> 2223.1000000000004
product that was like that x2 that's the

2221.6 --> 2225.08
one I use and he was like one of the

2223.1 --> 2226.73
first maybe in the world to present this

2225.08 --> 2229.1
product but I've heard that there is

2226.73 --> 2231.23
competition around so there's other

2229.1 --> 2236.0299999999997
nascent iodine source if you want to

2231.23 --> 2238.73
avoid Alex Jones no matter what yeah

2236.03 --> 2240.53
with all the the baller propaganda

2238.73 --> 2245.41
they're now pumping out on a more

2240.53 --> 2245.4100000000003
regular basis I kind of totally get that

2268.52 --> 2273.22
hey Crockett family farms ooh

2300.54 --> 2306.27
what kind of tea do by doing you know

2303.66 --> 2310.04
kinds of people with popping by yet

2306.27 --> 2310.04
green tea is green tea

2325.64 --> 2340.6099999999997
no that's [ __ ] is there some kind of

2334.49 --> 2347.18
funny attempt my genuine model potential

2340.61 --> 2351.58
option of the flat globe the moon is to

2347.18 --> 2354.5899999999997
join balloon it's not really appreciated

2351.58 --> 2357.77
because yeah the earth can turn out to

2354.59 --> 2362.33
be a flat globe where all the perfectly

2357.77 --> 2365.99
geometrical flat surfaces interconnect

2362.33 --> 2367.34
because of realm speciality because of

2365.99 --> 2371.6
the nature of the loop would

2367.34 --> 2373.9700000000003
interconnect perfectly to form a globe

2371.6 --> 2378.2599999999998
even though it's all flat and that would

2373.97 --> 2382.8799999999997
be the flat globe that's it could be

2378.26 --> 2387.26
that yeah hey I said it in my very first

2382.88 --> 2392.3
live stream on YouTube ever that that is

2387.26 --> 2396.1600000000003
indeed an option but that doesn't make

2392.3 --> 2396.1600000000003
the moon a balloon that's ridiculous

2397.64 --> 2400.7999999999997
[Music]

2407.58 --> 2417.7599999999998
how do I handle it well you get used to

2412.66 --> 2421.1189999999997
it Karen Cox and you had the the trick

2417.76 --> 2424.1800000000003
for me has always been to not completely

2421.119 --> 2427.0
cut off all my feelings to make it

2424.18 --> 2432.0099999999998
impossible for them to reach me because

2427.0 --> 2434.89
then I might also not pick up on some

2432.01 --> 2436.51
more subtle things that real people in

2434.89 --> 2439.0899999999997
my chat that are not trying to just

2436.51 --> 2441.73
disrupt me are putting out subtleties

2439.09 --> 2444.2200000000003
about them that I remember it's like

2441.73 --> 2447.4
almost remembering a person-to-person

2444.22 --> 2451.23
interaction that way so if I close down

2447.4 --> 2454.27
my senses entirely yeah I will not be as

2451.23 --> 2459.4
annoyed by the Chosin anymore but then

2454.27 --> 2462.1
it won't be able to do what I can do so

2459.4 --> 2465.01
yeah and they know that because I do

2462.1 --> 2468.25
still do report a response somewhat the

2465.01 --> 2470.4700000000003
trolling but yeah at the same time I

2468.25 --> 2473.56
take it as a challenge that they do it

2470.47 --> 2476.83
because they are sparring with me

2473.56 --> 2481.359
psychologically so I'm approaching this

2476.83 --> 2483.13
almost as a sport and then when they go

2481.359 --> 2485.56
too far then they know it and then

2483.13 --> 2489.76
they're banned so they're always just

2485.56 --> 2493.41
trying to see where the where the fine

2489.76 --> 2498.369
chiseled line of rules and morals are

2493.41 --> 2500.73
concerning me very robotically that's

2498.369 --> 2500.73
what they do

2502.18 --> 2516.64
I got no choice in that one no I think I

2512.619 --> 2520.329
do because there is ways to completely

2516.64 --> 2524.4
get rid of trolls and that is in a

2520.329 --> 2527.619
certain pattern of adaptation but yeah

2524.4 --> 2528.549
if I do that I'd become more a

2527.619 --> 2532.1800000000003
generalized

2528.549 --> 2536.079
media person and that's exactly what I

2532.18 --> 2542.91
don't want I want to build in my own way

2536.079 --> 2542.9100000000003
with as much of the real me as possible

2546.329 --> 2551.98
because that is where a lot of my

2548.5 --> 2559.359
strength lies in developed a lot of

2551.98 --> 2561.339
strength I'm genuinely being me every

2559.359 --> 2564.609
time actually I didn't do it I would

2561.339 --> 2567.779
falter I would lose my my confidence so

2564.609 --> 2570.73
yeah for me it's not really a choice

2567.779 --> 2577.809
and yes and rewards can be very fun to

2570.73 --> 2579.25
just to ban people like I sometimes just

2577.809 --> 2582.4300000000003
ban people without even mentioning

2579.25 --> 2584.47
because they're like subtle trolls there

2582.43 --> 2587.589
they are trolls but they're like trying

2584.47 --> 2589.299
to suck up at first yeah I know that I

2587.589 --> 2591.7599999999998
know exactly what it is you can't

2589.299 --> 2597.369
freaking trick me just I know that [ __ ]

2591.76 --> 2599.38
very quickly so now I won't even mention

2597.369 --> 2602.2200000000003
it but if somebody's just dropping by to

2599.38 --> 2605.349
make some kind of annoying gamma remark

2602.22 --> 2607.3599999999997
then it can be very fun to just ban them

2605.349 --> 2610.5190000000002
more publicly

2607.36 --> 2610.5190000000002
[Music]

2611.26 --> 2614.6800000000003
I don't mean to ban them unless they

2613.51 --> 2617.32
deserve yeah absolutely

2614.68 --> 2621.91
I prefer timeouts as a as a baseline

2617.32 --> 2623.92
approach but sometimes somebody just

2621.91 --> 2626.14
goes over the line in a certain way then

2623.92 --> 2627.82
then I'll just ban them because that

2626.14 --> 2629.71
already know okay that's not gonna

2627.82 --> 2632.4700000000003
anything coming out and that's not gonna

2629.71 --> 2635.43
be any better so there's no use in

2632.47 --> 2635.43
keeping them around

2645.27 --> 2652.92
talkie hm right

2658.04 --> 2668.13
yeah they are a bunch of snakes in the

2660.33 --> 2674.1
grass indeed it's like this they're very

2668.13 --> 2676.32
basic but that's superfluous personally

2674.1 --> 2680.79
not very useful thing that they do they

2676.32 --> 2683.04
are doing it on a pretty high level so

2680.79 --> 2686.52
they spend a lot of focus and energy on

2683.04 --> 2688.88
on doing it well as where I'm having an

2686.52 --> 2688.88
effect

hey you know what in an evening type of

2752.92 --> 2757.569
setup show no there's gonna be a lot

2754.719 --> 2762.509
more trollish people around sure I could

2757.569 --> 2767.319
have like oh yeah what is it

2762.509 --> 2769.809
therapy hour with Arwen so ballers can

2767.319 --> 2771.519
come over especially the trolls and just

2769.809 --> 2773.559
share their pain like how did they get

2771.519 --> 2776.0789999999997
there how did they become like this

2773.559 --> 2778.599
what do they feel about it they think

2776.079 --> 2781.8390000000004
they can ever get out of that and and

2778.599 --> 2782.529
actually build a proper social life that

2781.839 --> 2784.839
kind of thing

2782.529 --> 2787.989
I don't know but for the in the morning

2784.839 --> 2791.92
now it's too much too much just let

2787.989 --> 2793.599
actual trolls get wreak havoc that's not

2791.92 --> 2794.2490000000003
something you want to wake up to in the

2793.599 --> 2801.67
morning

2794.249 --> 2804.519
well I wouldn't yeah that Spurs chemos

2801.67 --> 2808.029
job but he's too much of a suck-up he's

2804.519 --> 2811.9889999999996
trying to be too popular an effective

2808.029 --> 2813.969
psychology isn't a nice guy or a girl

2811.989 --> 2818.199
that's only the ones that just want to

2813.969 --> 2820.4790000000003
keep you linked up to keep you coming

2818.199 --> 2825.369
back to pay them well I'm not gonna do

2820.479 --> 2827.799
it like that as a what I do the

2825.369 --> 2830.4100000000003
psychology part I do it really to be

2827.799 --> 2832.239
effective and that's going to be pretty

2830.41 --> 2833.229
direct sometimes I use my own

2832.239 --> 2836.579
methodology

2833.229 --> 2839.89
I'm not abiding by any psycho

2836.579 --> 2842.65
therapeutical standards at it but I am

2839.89 --> 2847.859
well aware of some what dangers lie

2842.65 --> 2853.4790000000003
hidden within the psyche so I'm not just

2847.859 --> 2856.199
completely reckless and that just shows

2853.479 --> 2856.1989999999996
