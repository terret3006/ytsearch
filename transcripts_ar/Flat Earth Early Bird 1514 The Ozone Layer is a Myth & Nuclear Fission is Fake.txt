8.05 --> 37.879999999999995
[Music]

61.46 --> 66.38

and yeah I can still definitely use the

97.079 --> 99.259
support

100.32 --> 108.119
right so yeah the weather today is

104.6 --> 111.0
kind of Stormy and Restless

108.119 --> 115.079
it's full on clouded

111.0 --> 117.36
and yeah there's a constant wind blowing

115.079 --> 121.1
birds are just

117.36 --> 121.1
bouncing around in the sky

124.28 --> 132.84
it's not really been raining or just

127.74 --> 135.0
very short moments mostly in the night

132.84 --> 137.64000000000001
and then when it stops I guess that all

135.0 --> 140.72
the wind just makes it makes it

137.64 --> 140.72
evaporate quickly

141.36 --> 143.959
right

145.16 --> 149.0
not super interesting

150.48 --> 153.379
they're Restless

153.84 --> 159.9
right

156.3 --> 161.87900000000002
hey LSG first in chat good to see you

159.9 --> 164.22
are you doing

161.879 --> 167.39999999999998
huh

164.22 --> 171.42
the chat is on top

167.4 --> 173.4
for a change again in the screen I don't

171.42 --> 176.45899999999997
know why it does that sometimes and

173.4 --> 178.87900000000002
other times it doesn't

176.459 --> 178.879
uh

180.18 --> 186.18
it is Friday the 17th of February 2023

186.3 --> 190.739
ah

189.03 --> 193.08
[Music]

190.739 --> 197.3
I'm gonna try to take it easy I mean

193.08 --> 197.3
yesterday was a bit of a grinding day

197.519 --> 203.459
it was interesting though but

201.72 --> 206.099
it's just that

203.459 --> 208.14000000000001
yeah the live show over at fed got cut

206.099 --> 210.23899999999998
off

208.14 --> 213.54
very early when it went live that was

210.239 --> 218.4
weird but then Nathan started back up

213.54 --> 219.959
and then we had like a five hour live

218.4 --> 223.5
stream

219.959 --> 227.04
that was just insane

223.5 --> 228.54
it was so long that like I got a bit of

227.04 --> 231.659
a headache

228.54 --> 234.17999999999998
of it eventually but also because it was

231.659 --> 236.879
just humble Age Again

234.18 --> 238.86
and just kept on going and going in the

236.879 --> 242.879
same freaking points again and I was

238.86 --> 247.87900000000002
just like I'm I was going nuts

242.879 --> 247.879
it's just like please just make him stop

252.9 --> 258.23900000000003
but still overall and like I had that

256.5 --> 260.639
agitation the rest of the guys didn't

258.239 --> 262.69899999999996
seem to have it that much Adam Meek in a

260.639 --> 262.699
bit

264.06 --> 267.979
and they were analyzing it

270.3 --> 273.72
there was just something really weird

272.04 --> 278.04
about him

273.72 --> 283.28000000000003
and yeah I spotted that pretty early and

278.04 --> 283.28000000000003
he's just holding tight to his act

284.16 --> 288.41900000000004
but it

285.66 --> 290.58000000000004
when I was out yeah eventually I kind of

288.419 --> 292.32
like just let it go and just went

290.58 --> 294.35999999999996
getting dinner

292.32 --> 296.28
and then when I came back apparently he

294.36 --> 298.08000000000004
had left and

296.28 --> 299.63899999999995
everybody was convinced that he had

298.08 --> 302.82
given off like

299.639 --> 304.919
certain mannerisms that revealed that he

302.82 --> 307.68
was just playing with everybody like a

304.919 --> 311.96
troll so I missed that part

307.68 --> 311.96
but I mean I'm not surprised

313.199 --> 318.3
something really eerie about him I mean

315.36 --> 321.6
I spent one time I spent

318.3 --> 325.5
an hour at least you were there right

321.6 --> 327.72
I spent like an hour one-on-one without

325.5 --> 330.08
anybody interrupting me even not even

327.72 --> 330.08000000000004
him

330.139 --> 336.539
perfectly clearly explaining

333.72 --> 339.41900000000004
the dilemma with the wave function

336.539 --> 342.18
perfectly like you couldn't be more

339.419 --> 344.58
clear about it like I cannot conceive of

342.18 --> 348.06
anybody ever being able to explain it

344.58 --> 350.69899999999996
more clearly than that

348.06 --> 353.46
and it's just like it's

350.699 --> 354.66
just swiped it off it just like it never

353.46 --> 358.46
happened

354.66 --> 358.46000000000004
none of that ever happened to him

359.4 --> 364.25899999999996
and that also feels like very personally

362.16 --> 367.259
insulting like that because yeah I gave

364.259 --> 370.199
him the best explanation ever

367.259 --> 373.5
and he's just like forgotten it or he's

370.199 --> 375.72
ignoring it it's terrible

373.5 --> 379.94
anyway

375.72 --> 379.94000000000005
so yeah that was all pretty intense

381.5 --> 385.919
[Music]

383.4 --> 387.84
you could you could probably consider it

385.919 --> 391.03999999999996
as like psychological warfare a bit

387.84 --> 393.29999999999995
because that is in a way what it was

391.04 --> 395.34000000000003
[Music]

393.3 --> 396.90000000000003
and it felt a lot like he was trying to

395.34 --> 399.59999999999997
entrap everybody

396.9 --> 401.88
get them in a weird corner

399.6 --> 404.72
and he wouldn't do it with me

401.88 --> 404.71999999999997
by the way

405.12 --> 409.02
because I'm like oh oh you want to talk

407.28 --> 410.88
about that sub you want to talk about G

409.02 --> 411.9
I know stuff about that I'll talk about

410.88 --> 415.68
it

411.9 --> 419.17999999999995
what no no he wanted it from QE Super

415.68 --> 419.18
Fan of QE supposedly

422.28 --> 426.67999999999995
it was it's just all weird anyway

432.0 --> 437.96
hate watching

434.28 --> 437.96
anybody else out there

444.24 --> 448.259
so yeah that's what's

446.34 --> 451.08
that was what I was doing most of the

448.259 --> 454.199
time I mean we even missed the other

451.08 --> 456.3
streams typically like Jim Bob and flat

454.199 --> 461.06
Zoid

456.3 --> 461.06
big because it was just going

461.34 --> 467.17999999999995
let's see a bit of kiwi had another

463.919 --> 470.269
treatment session but it was very late

467.18 --> 470.269
[Music]

471.06 --> 475.28000000000003
so I only saw a little bit of that

477.66 --> 484.97900000000004
some some weirdo guy

481.259 --> 487.56
like a bit of a soy boy looking guy it

484.979 --> 491.479
was just endlessly blabbering on with

487.56 --> 495.36
mctoon and the guy was like really

491.479 --> 497.88
terrible at explaining it things it was

495.36 --> 499.86
just very hard to even follow

497.88 --> 502.34
sometimes what he was even referenced

499.86 --> 502.34000000000003
it's like

502.44 --> 508.08
it's only because I'm pretty smart that

505.62 --> 511.379
I could even understand what he was

508.08 --> 512.279
trying to convey but if you're not that

511.379 --> 514.44
smart

512.279 --> 516.779
then you have absolutely no clue what

514.44 --> 520.32
the hell he's talking about

516.779 --> 522.24
and he just went on and on and on never

520.32 --> 526.099
stopped

522.24 --> 526.099
that was QE live

526.62 --> 531.68
uh

528.839 --> 531.6800000000001
the doctor

532.04 --> 535.279
ridiculous guy

535.44 --> 539.82
although he might be really good at

537.48 --> 542.339
programming or something but I mean just

539.82 --> 544.2
I was like just put that guy behind the

542.339 --> 547.6800000000001
keyboard and make him shut the [ __ ] up

544.2 --> 550.62
because he's probably pretty

547.68 --> 553.5
smart and effective but I mean he's

550.62 --> 555.899
terrible at explaining and he's a globe

553.5 --> 558.18
delusional idiot

555.899 --> 560.22
who's very ill-informed about those

558.18 --> 562.92
things yet thinks he's no he knows

560.22 --> 566.279
everything about it anyway typical

562.92 --> 568.459
a Wells Reese flutter Sage good to see

566.279 --> 568.459
you

573.42 --> 578.4799999999999
talking about nonsense

576.24 --> 578.48
foreign

584.839 --> 591.6
that's yeah oh that's their non-space

588.24 --> 595.86
yeah no that's not my non-square that's

591.6 --> 599.9590000000001
space time non-space nonsense okay

595.86 --> 599.9590000000001
that's Einstein and non-space

600.18 --> 604.92
you could say it's based on the that

603.3 --> 606.779
that mechanism

604.92 --> 611.06
that's not the non-space that I've

606.779 --> 611.06
talked about my non-space is literally

611.82 --> 617.6400000000001
like a position in euclidean space where

615.0 --> 620.459
no matter can exist

617.64 --> 623.18
but it's set it's a very of a very

620.459 --> 623.18
different nature

624.12 --> 628.1
yo

625.32 --> 628.1
apparent what

629.16 --> 634.26
yeah whatever I mean flat earthers out

631.98 --> 636.899
there they talk about all kinds of [ __ ]

634.26 --> 639.24
too and they make up a bunch of [ __ ]

636.899 --> 641.279
and they're not consistent and they

639.24 --> 644.279
don't understand what they're lending

641.279 --> 646.019
from like oh yeah you do don't even

644.279 --> 647.64
realize oh you're riding on space-time

646.019 --> 649.32
mechanic yeah it's very popular out

647.64 --> 650.8199999999999
there a lot of vernacular goes around

649.32 --> 652.6800000000001
using that yeah

650.82 --> 655.86
but as a flat Earth you should know

652.68 --> 659.459
better than that because it's based off

655.86 --> 662.94
a complete nonsense fictional medium

659.459 --> 666.0
and there's no point to it

662.94 --> 667.9200000000001
right but yeah that's not stopping some

666.0 --> 671.959
Flat Earth is out there from making up

667.92 --> 671.959
[ __ ] that involves that sort of thing

678.2 --> 682.339
model

679.74 --> 682.339
really

683.399 --> 688.92
okay is that from like a flatter Society

686.64 --> 691.079
thing or something what are you talking

688.92 --> 694.519
about Ralph's Reese I this is all

691.079 --> 694.519
getting very confusing now

704.82 --> 707.82
search

718.38 --> 722.88
okay

720.67 --> 725.42
[Music]

722.88 --> 725.42
foreign

743.18 --> 746.8389999999999
like old footage

749.459 --> 755.8199999999999
I got one from bullfro bull frog films

753.959 --> 758.2399999999999
channel is the is that what you're

755.82 --> 758.24
talking about

760.079 --> 764.0
25 minutes oh

765.54 --> 771.5999999999999
do you have a link for it I could give

768.6 --> 773.9590000000001
you a wrench so you could post it

771.6 --> 773.9590000000001
okay

774.24 --> 777.32
both okay

780.3 --> 785.3
oh don't

781.98 --> 785.3000000000001
for eight auto play

794.339 --> 797.0600000000001
bro

798.12 --> 801.44
what the

802.32 --> 807.899
where is it he has a lot of freaking

805.56 --> 811.8199999999999
videos Man

807.899 --> 811.82
I'm not like seeing it

818.519 --> 823.04
I think okay I'll give you a wrench for

820.8 --> 823.04
a bit

823.44 --> 825.86
okay

831.5 --> 839.559
[Music]

840.42 --> 846.54
but I mean seriously the looping in the

844.079 --> 849.56
90s what

846.54 --> 849.56
this is uh

852.06 --> 858.1999999999999
what the hell is that

854.519 --> 858.2
that's not a YouTube video

858.48 --> 861.019
okay

873.18 --> 877.9799999999999
so I take it there it's just a bunch of

876.42 --> 879.66
guys talking

877.98 --> 882.48
and some

879.66 --> 886.139
bad drawings and footage of Antarctica

882.48 --> 889.139
there's no actual modeling going on

886.139 --> 891.5
so they're describing the loop or what

889.139 --> 895.639
is this

891.5 --> 895.639
airships that's cool

907.92 --> 913.579
okay

909.779 --> 913.579
20 minutes in

926.699 --> 929.699
laughs

930.48 --> 933.48
what

941.699 --> 947.16
okay I just see some guy moving a plate

944.699 --> 949.92
up and down is he talking about

947.16 --> 953.2199999999999
gravity there or something

949.92 --> 955.199
now footage of a globe

953.22 --> 958.88
yeah I'm not because I'm not playing any

955.199 --> 958.88
sound on this I don't know what it is

965.18 --> 970.3199999999999
okay so whatever if they're saying

967.98 --> 973.019
looping or something then I'm not gonna

970.32 --> 974.7600000000001
if it's just saying it that's cool and

973.019 --> 978.24
all but

974.76 --> 981.48
seems like flatter Society

978.24 --> 984.839
well I mean

981.48 --> 987.9590000000001
they mix in footage of like fisheye lens

984.839 --> 990.3000000000001
globe and all that so yeah it does seem

987.959 --> 993.959
like these are not like this is not a

990.3 --> 996.56
dedicated flattered video or anything

993.959 --> 996.56
uh

1001.06 --> 1005.4399999999999
compares to mine all right

1005.54 --> 1009.8199999999999
all right yeah I'm sure I'll check it

1007.639 --> 1009.82
out

1014.72 --> 1022.4590000000001
what no you want an Oculus okay LSG

1020.0 --> 1026.12
that's weird

1022.459 --> 1030.28
foreign be careful with that

1026.12 --> 1030.28
don't get sucked up in the metaverse

1036.679 --> 1040.179
yeah sure I'll take a look

1041.0 --> 1046.059
this just you caught me off guard with

1042.98 --> 1046.059
this like what

1046.22 --> 1051.74
I mean I've seen

1049.22 --> 1054.919
weirder older video I might have seen

1051.74 --> 1057.799
this video even like when I was young

1054.919 --> 1059.539
I mean I would have been 10 so maybe I

1057.799 --> 1062.299
was like

1059.539 --> 1066.32
11 or 12 when I saw this I could have

1062.299 --> 1069.32
seen this when I was young that video

1066.32 --> 1071.6789999999999
that you just linked me to like on the

1069.32 --> 1071.6789999999999
television

1072.16 --> 1078.679
because or on a like a videotape

1075.86 --> 1080.1789999999999
probably because

1078.679 --> 1083.66
I don't know

1080.179 --> 1084.919
I was very interested and my parents did

1083.66 --> 1087.64
like

1084.919 --> 1091.1000000000001
were kind of interested in these sort of

1087.64 --> 1095.2
Curiosities about the Earth as well

1091.1 --> 1095.1999999999998
and yeah I might have seen it

1096.14 --> 1101.179
don't particularly remember it maybe if

1098.72 --> 1104.44
I hear it hear them talking that I'll

1101.179 --> 1104.44
actually remember it better

1111.74 --> 1116.84
right but to be fair you know the whole

1114.5 --> 1119.299
looping idea

1116.84 --> 1120.4399999999998
a looping rectangular is basically a

1119.299 --> 1124.6399999999999
model

1120.44 --> 1127.5800000000002
right but what the real key aspect of my

1124.64 --> 1130.039
idea about how the Earth is

1127.58 --> 1132.08
what what's really the key factor is

1130.039 --> 1134.12
well what how I started out and that is

1132.08 --> 1136.8799999999999
that I I have the suspicion that space

1134.12 --> 1138.4399999999998
is not entirely linear

1136.88 --> 1141.44
right

1138.44 --> 1144.26
because yeah you can look at the disk

1141.44 --> 1146.8400000000001
model and then it's like oh yeah what do

1144.26 --> 1148.94
you mean Loop right it's just orientated

1146.84 --> 1151.8799999999999
differently yeah but then things don't

1148.94 --> 1154.3400000000001
exactly fit

1151.88 --> 1157.7
just like on a globe

1154.34 --> 1160.28
like the scale is not consistent

1157.7 --> 1164.539
in that model and neither on the globe

1160.28 --> 1167.72
so like why why is it so freaking hard

1164.539 --> 1170.66
to get some kind of as is projection

1167.72 --> 1174.26
that where everything is to scale why

1170.66 --> 1175.5800000000002
why is this so incredibly difficult

1174.26 --> 1178.1
well

1175.58 --> 1181.52
maybe it's because space is not entirely

1178.1 --> 1185.24
linear so it's just like impossible to

1181.52 --> 1188.059
represent it as is because the how space

1185.24 --> 1188.96
interconnects is just irregular in some

1188.059 --> 1191.539
way

1188.96 --> 1195.02
so it's like you can't actually show it

1191.539 --> 1198.08
as is all flat because it is all flat it

1195.02 --> 1201.08
is all on the same level type of flat

1198.08 --> 1203.299
but when you try to present it in some

1201.08 --> 1206.86
projection it's like everything is off

1203.299 --> 1210.26
it why why

1206.86 --> 1213.08
it's so frustrating and surreal right

1210.26 --> 1215.84
well my conclusion very early

1213.08 --> 1217.82
before I started to move even on the

1215.84 --> 1219.28
rectangular looping model that I got

1217.82 --> 1223.28
from

1219.28 --> 1225.3799999999999
flat energy was renamed like Square

1223.28 --> 1226.7
Earth cosmology Channel

1225.38 --> 1228.6200000000001
right

1226.7 --> 1231.26
before that was just like yeah maybe

1228.62 --> 1234.799
space is just not linear but when I

1231.26 --> 1238.58
tried to communicate that back in 2016

1234.799 --> 1242.0
I people were just like wow you sound

1238.58 --> 1243.62
kind of crazy like you sounds like Peach

1242.0 --> 1245.96
a or something that's what people were

1243.62 --> 1247.28
saying back then about it when I

1245.96 --> 1249.679
mentioned that

1247.28 --> 1252.74
so that's when I just like okay then

1249.679 --> 1254.7800000000002
I'll just find a model when I shove a

1252.74 --> 1257.84
model in people's face

1254.78 --> 1260.1789999999999
for some reason then they will be more

1257.84 --> 1262.82
likely to listen

1260.179 --> 1264.38
then if I'm just trying to say space is

1262.82 --> 1266.4189999999999
not linear

1264.38 --> 1269.1200000000001
right and hey in my flat Earth talk

1266.419 --> 1270.7990000000002
shows I talk a lot about this

1269.12 --> 1272.6599999999999
if you watch back those shows and

1270.799 --> 1274.6399999999999
they're still right there

1272.66 --> 1276.6200000000001
years ago

1274.64 --> 1280.9
you'll see that I'm bringing that up

1276.62 --> 1280.8999999999999
spatial non-linearity a lot

1282.559 --> 1287.539
but if you can still see the chats from

1285.08 --> 1291.5
back then also you'll figure out that

1287.539 --> 1294.26
people were like uh okay

1291.5 --> 1298.28
they didn't understand it I like nobody

1294.26 --> 1300.02
barely anybody would even even try to

1298.28 --> 1302.059
hear me out they were just like okay

1300.02 --> 1303.3799999999999
he's just talking about really weird

1302.059 --> 1305.6
stuff

1303.38 --> 1308.74
keep going keep talking about really

1305.6 --> 1308.74
weird stuff Arwin

1311.36 --> 1314.9189999999999
let me get back to you guys

1315.62 --> 1319.299
oh you're getting into chemistry

1322.039 --> 1327.46
process of learning orbitals what

1327.679 --> 1332.2
what do you mean

1329.179 --> 1332.2
let her Sage

1336.08 --> 1341.1399999999999
I mean orbits are not exactly part of

1338.84 --> 1343.82
chemistry I mean that's like theoretical

1341.14 --> 1346.46
micro chemistry right that's like trying

1343.82 --> 1347.8999999999999
to figure out like what's phys like what

1346.46 --> 1350.1200000000001
are the

1347.9 --> 1352.76
the electrons and the protons and

1350.12 --> 1354.9189999999999
neutrons and how does the electron work

1352.76 --> 1357.14
and then there's the theoretical orbit

1354.919 --> 1360.8600000000001
of it right

1357.14 --> 1363.3200000000002
but that's pure conception

1360.86 --> 1365.299
and yeah that's out there too I mean

1363.32 --> 1367.34
some people are really into it same

1365.299 --> 1369.26
people that of course are really into

1367.34 --> 1371.24
the globe right

1369.26 --> 1373.8799999999999
but I mean that's not actually the

1371.24 --> 1375.74
chemistry chemistry is just learning

1373.88 --> 1378.3200000000002
like what happens with this and that

1375.74 --> 1382.28
what is it transform into and this and

1378.32 --> 1385.28
that and like how do you organize your

1382.28 --> 1387.6789999999999
oversight over what is what that is the

1385.28 --> 1391.3999999999999
chemistry I went through that

1387.679 --> 1393.02
a bit with like some online class that's

1391.4 --> 1396.0800000000002
in Dutch by the way

1393.02 --> 1396.86
years ago I still have it in my browser

1396.08 --> 1400.1789999999999
list

1396.86 --> 1400.1789999999999
and it got pretty far

1400.76 --> 1407.12
and it did really freshen me up because

1404.6 --> 1409.3999999999999
I never I like didn't graduate on

1407.12 --> 1410.7199999999998
chemistry I did I had chemistry like any

1409.4 --> 1412.3400000000001
earlier

1410.72 --> 1414.02
uh

1412.34 --> 1417.52
classes

1414.02 --> 1420.3799999999999
the years before but I yeah I didn't

1417.52 --> 1423.08
particularly well it wasn't really good

1420.38 --> 1426.0200000000002
at it because it was like all about just

1423.08 --> 1427.1
remembering and it wasn't all that great

1426.02 --> 1429.6399999999999
at it

1427.1 --> 1429.6399999999999
right

1432.22 --> 1437.539
also because yeah I was uh so I'm

1435.26 --> 1438.98
getting a bit here and there right but I

1437.539 --> 1441.2
didn't have any problems with that with

1438.98 --> 1443.24
math because for math for me was not

1441.2 --> 1445.4
about remembering at all it was just

1443.24 --> 1448.159
about

1445.4 --> 1450.2
like puzzling the patterns understanding

1448.159 --> 1453.2600000000002
and remembering patterns and remembering

1450.2 --> 1456.74
patterns I've never had issues with

1453.26 --> 1459.74
but like memorizing

1456.74 --> 1461.059
just information where you don't exactly

1459.74 --> 1462.74
know yet

1461.059 --> 1466.1
how it interconnects with everything

1462.74 --> 1469.46
else I've been I'm terrible at that

1466.1 --> 1471.98
I first need to understand and oversee

1469.46 --> 1475.3600000000001
it and then it just permanently

1471.98 --> 1475.3600000000001
integrates with my system

1475.7 --> 1481.48
then I just get the understanding I know

1478.7 --> 1484.28
the pattern of what to do

1481.48 --> 1485.6
and that's it it's a different type of

1484.28 --> 1489.559
memory

1485.6 --> 1491.84
I've never been like just learn facts

1489.559 --> 1493.28
and then you have you're like a database

1491.84 --> 1495.3799999999999
and you can look it up inside yourself

1493.28 --> 1498.559
I've never been like that

1495.38 --> 1502.22
it's terrible at it

1498.559 --> 1504.62
electron orbitals I knew it see

1502.22 --> 1507.159
yeah but that is basically theoretical

1504.62 --> 1507.1589999999999
chemistry

1510.86 --> 1517.24
right just like theoretical physics I

1513.74 --> 1517.24
mean it is kind of

1517.58 --> 1521.9189999999999
it is more theoretical physics actually

1522.32 --> 1525.28
flutter Sage

1534.34 --> 1539.98
so you've been looking into theoretical

1537.02 --> 1539.98
physics at you

1540.14 --> 1543.14
foreign

1573.1 --> 1577.12
I don't know what that means

1599.919 --> 1605.1200000000001
like why are you expecting me to oh

1602.9 --> 1607.76
there's a letter there and and you think

1605.12 --> 1611.059
that I get that

1607.76 --> 1612.5
hello it's Arwen here you know how this

1611.059 --> 1614.6
works

1612.5 --> 1616.94
if you're gonna Describe You're gonna

1614.6 --> 1619.8799999999999
have to spell it out

1616.94 --> 1623.74
yeah a bunch of letters or equations

1619.88 --> 1623.74
doesn't mean anything to me

1641.48 --> 1645.22
come on flutter Sage

1660.46 --> 1665.44
right great uh yeah

1665.779 --> 1668.799
let's see

1673.7 --> 1677.539
I was listening to Fox day on D live

1676.22 --> 1680.659
yesterday

1677.539 --> 1682.52
it was pretty interesting some message

1680.659 --> 1685.9
like

1682.52 --> 1685.9
just stop talking

1687.5 --> 1692.659
like

1688.7 --> 1696.46
don't just keep on blabbering endlessly

1692.659 --> 1696.46
I thought it was pretty sensible

1697.279 --> 1701.72
it was I guess so it was in the

1700.159 --> 1706.279
chemistry course

1701.72 --> 1708.32
right well they might add that on I mean

1706.279 --> 1710.86
it's basically a bit of theoretical

1708.32 --> 1710.86
physics

1710.96 --> 1718.64
to model some micro or sub chemistry

1716.0 --> 1723.1
because this is not really relevant at

1718.64 --> 1723.1000000000001
all to actual chemist knowledge

1725.48 --> 1732.6200000000001
yeah

1727.84 --> 1735.279
Atomic orbit it's potential yeah

1732.62 --> 1735.279
it is

1741.26 --> 1747.5
I mean an actual chemist that I mean

1745.64 --> 1749.48
an actual chemist would definitely know

1747.5 --> 1750.799
that I mean if you asked Adam Meek and

1749.48 --> 1753.02
he would know

1750.799 --> 1757.12
that that sort of thing

1753.02 --> 1757.12
right he understands that very well

1757.58 --> 1762.22
but I also even as a non-chemist

1762.5 --> 1769.159
I've learned to distinguish that as well

1765.34 --> 1773.08
that's that even came up with my uh my

1769.159 --> 1773.0800000000002
show with says Moretz remember

1774.38 --> 1779.24
about the difference forms like the

1777.74 --> 1781.58
different

1779.24 --> 1786.22
conceptions of mass

1781.58 --> 1789.3799999999999
like atomic mass as a as a chemistry

1786.22 --> 1791.3600000000001
notification and mass as a physics

1789.38 --> 1793.659
notification how they were radically

1791.36 --> 1793.6589999999999
different

1796.1 --> 1798.1
um

1799.82 --> 1802.6
bro

1804.559 --> 1809.96
that's so you're literally saying

1807.2 --> 1812.8990000000001
something that you don't know what it is

1809.96 --> 1815.299
that's a bit ridiculous flatter Sage I

1812.899 --> 1817.6999999999998
mean if you're gonna use shorts on like

1815.299 --> 1819.44
oh this is what that means but you don't

1817.7 --> 1822.64
know what it even means I mean come on

1819.44 --> 1822.64
why are you saying it then

1825.679 --> 1830.299
uh

1828.14 --> 1832.8200000000002
not much huge use trying to explain

1830.299 --> 1836.679
something when you don't understand it

1832.82 --> 1836.6789999999999
anyway never mind

1847.46 --> 1852.44
but uh yeah what kind of chemistry are

1849.98 --> 1857.38
you getting into are you just

1852.44 --> 1857.38
for what is it job related or

1857.96 --> 1861.58
or she's just out of curiosity

1877.33 --> 1880.54
[Music]

1880.7 --> 1884.559
and how are you two minutes behind

1884.72 --> 1887.6200000000001
how is that working

1891.08 --> 1897.08
I mean the response time is very quick

1894.44 --> 1900.98
I specifically set my

1897.08 --> 1903.5
this uh my OBS settings in a way

1900.98 --> 1905.059
oh wait YouTube settings in a way that's

1903.5 --> 1906.98
extremely quick

1905.059 --> 1908.779
because hey this is all about the

1906.98 --> 1912.5
interactions not like all the video

1908.779 --> 1916.0
quality is so important oh

1912.5 --> 1916.0
I mean yeah I don't wanna

1916.76 --> 1924.02
I I didn't want don't want like a 240

1920.299 --> 1926.6589999999999
type of video or whatever but

1924.02 --> 1929.0
I mean it is about the live interaction

1926.659 --> 1932.679
so I don't and why are you two minutes

1929.0 --> 1932.679
behind what's going on

1933.679 --> 1937.6000000000001
is your internet just slow or something

1940.7 --> 1945.82
I don't seem to have any leg issues

1943.1 --> 1945.82
myself here

1948.86 --> 1954.34
I'm roughly one second behind in the

1952.159 --> 1954.3400000000001
video

1956.96 --> 1965.0
no wait two two seconds anyway uh

1961.779 --> 1968.08
let's get back to a conversation that's

1965.0 --> 1968.08
worth talking about

1975.44 --> 1980.48
was there something you wanted to

1977.96 --> 1982.88
communicate about

1980.48 --> 1986.0
what you learned about chemistry or

1982.88 --> 1988.659
about this orbitals or whatever was

1986.0 --> 1991.279
there anything because I might have like

1988.659 --> 1993.2600000000002
sidetracked you

1991.279 --> 1994.7
because I wanted more clarity but what

1993.26 --> 1997.0
were you trying to communicate about

1994.7 --> 1997.0
that

2000.58 --> 2006.76
what if your phone it pauses the text

2003.76 --> 2008.26
when talk ugh

2006.76 --> 2011.94
why

2008.26 --> 2011.94
that's super inconvenient

2026.5 --> 2032.44
wow does it

2029.38 --> 2035.8200000000002
like does it always work like that

2032.44 --> 2035.8200000000002
that's terrible

2036.1 --> 2042.899
what a stupid system

2039.34 --> 2042.899
why can't you just have it play

2046.5 --> 2052.26
[Music]

2052.72 --> 2057.7
okay all right let us say you're right

2055.3 --> 2061.8990000000003
so you just have to Fresh it up for it

2057.7 --> 2066.24
for the job okay makes sense

2061.899 --> 2066.24
you want to start doing experiments oh

2079.2 --> 2084.48
just be very careful with the liquid

2081.879 --> 2084.48
oxygen

2092.48 --> 2095.57
[Music]

2117.88 --> 2120.42
together

2121.839 --> 2128.619
now it's not Java

2125.74 --> 2133.02
wait did you

2128.619 --> 2133.02
is it no or now

2135.359 --> 2142.619
so it's not job related I misread that

2140.14 --> 2142.6189999999997
did

2146.079 --> 2148.6800000000003
okay

2149.38 --> 2154.92
so you just wanted to get into chemistry

2152.32 --> 2154.92
I guess again

2156.16 --> 2160.66
I see what you missed out on

2158.619 --> 2163.359
but that's funny in a way that was the

2160.66 --> 2165.52
reason too for me

2163.359 --> 2167.3199999999997
to get back into chemistry and I even

2165.52 --> 2170.14
thought at the time like maybe I could

2167.32 --> 2172.7200000000003
teach this I mean I think I could be

2170.14 --> 2176.2599999999998
basic chemistry teacher

2172.72 --> 2179.56
definitely physics

2176.26 --> 2181.8390000000004
I mean even with all the [ __ ] I like

2179.56 --> 2185.5
oh you have to teach Newtonian mechanics

2181.839 --> 2187.48
okay or I can actually do that really

2185.5 --> 2191.92
well

2187.48 --> 2197.2
and even as I'm teaching it to them

2191.92 --> 2200.079
like give references as to like

2197.2 --> 2202.18
like the historical importance of this

2200.079 --> 2204.52
that it's a way of thinking I could even

2202.18 --> 2207.94
get I could basically help them with the

2204.52 --> 2212.4
psychology on top of it very easily

2207.94 --> 2212.4
so yeah I can be a teacher like that

2213.22 --> 2216.8799999999997
and that's part of the reason why I got

2215.14 --> 2220.7
into it back then because I thought like

2216.88 --> 2223.83
yeah maybe I can get a job with that

2220.7 --> 2223.83
[Music]

2224.079 --> 2229.619
or okay that's what why

2232.119 --> 2238.109
and what do you think that's funny

2234.76 --> 2238.1090000000004

2320.76 --> 2326.44
sorry I got a bit distracted it's just

2323.74 --> 2328.1189999999997
an article that wasn't exactly what I

2326.44 --> 2331.7400000000002
was expecting

2328.119 --> 2331.7400000000002
it's interesting yeah

2334.18 --> 2339.839
doing a series of intro vids to my ideas

2341.859 --> 2344.04
foreign

2356.04 --> 2362.04
it's just totally not my style at all to

2359.68 --> 2362.04
do that

2363.22 --> 2367.24
but I've had episodes and where it's

2365.619 --> 2368.619
just like okay now we're gonna talk

2367.24 --> 2370.9599999999996
about this

2368.619 --> 2373.0
and then I'm gonna like if people are

2370.96 --> 2376.54
really curious about it I will explain

2373.0 --> 2379.18
everything about this subject and then

2376.54 --> 2381.7599999999998
often that subject's gonna be in the

2379.18 --> 2383.6189999999997
show title so you can look it up

2381.76 --> 2385.96
that's how I do it

2383.619 --> 2388.6600000000003
I'm not like oh I'm going to make a

2385.96 --> 2390.52
snippet set of videos and make that like

2388.66 --> 2392.74
a default because they're gonna wear on

2390.52 --> 2394.96
me

2392.74 --> 2397.54
I mean my understanding of my

2394.96 --> 2402.119
conceptions are expanding

2397.54 --> 2402.119
there's further development

2409.24 --> 2412.8999999999996
but I mean for example let's just say I

2411.88 --> 2416.2000000000003
start

2412.9 --> 2419.6800000000003
over again like on some other platform

2416.2 --> 2422.859
and like this thing is all screwed up or

2419.68 --> 2425.98
it's all been banned and deleted

2422.859 --> 2427.42
well then yeah I would definitely

2425.98 --> 2430.119
make

2427.42 --> 2431.92
a quick set of conceptions to basically

2430.119 --> 2433.599
put down

2431.92 --> 2436.42
what I'm about

2433.599 --> 2438.4
before I start to re-engage

2436.42 --> 2440.8
that would be a logical thing to do in

2438.4 --> 2443.56
such a circumstance but yeah there's no

2440.8 --> 2445.48
real need for it I mean I'm right here

2443.56 --> 2447.4
I'm live

2445.48 --> 2451.42
I've got

2447.4 --> 2456.78
a huge set of shows behind me

2451.42 --> 2456.78
that I can point to sometimes specifics

2457.24 --> 2463.18
and if you've just followed me then yeah

2459.82 --> 2465.1600000000003
if you just keep watching stuff

2463.18 --> 2468.96
my shows

2465.16 --> 2468.96
then eventually you will know

2471.46 --> 2474.94
and if that's not enough yeah then

2473.02 --> 2478.8
you're gonna have to show up in my chat

2474.94 --> 2478.8
and then we'll do it live

2488.16 --> 2495.46
yeah yeah roughly three to four thousand

2492.46 --> 2497.2
hours to catch up on the I know

2495.46 --> 2499.3
it's a bit much

2497.2 --> 2502.8999999999996
but I mean it's not even like every show

2499.3 --> 2504.1600000000003
is super interesting or anything

2502.9 --> 2506.92
but

2504.16 --> 2509.2
you can definitely browse through titles

2506.92 --> 2511.2400000000002
I mean you can just scroll through all

2509.2 --> 2512.98
those titles and see if something stands

2511.24 --> 2515.0789999999997
out

2512.98 --> 2516.579
or remind you of something or it's like

2515.079 --> 2519.599
the energy is

2516.579 --> 2519.599
you know like

2534.06 --> 2538.56
all right someone here

2539.32 --> 2543.0
ah okay

2546.94 --> 2551.98
yeah my OBS was disconnecting for some

2550.599 --> 2554.92
reason

2551.98 --> 2556.2400000000002
I managed to figure that out quick

2554.92 --> 2559.119
enough

2556.24 --> 2559.5699999999997
so that I wouldn't have interrupted the

2559.119 --> 2562.8
Stream

2559.57 --> 2562.8
[Music]

2576.82 --> 2582.579
okay flatter Sage that sounds pretty

2579.22 --> 2584.1
messed up maybe uh maybe you shouldn't

2582.579 --> 2587.32
be making that stuff

2584.1 --> 2587.3199999999997
[Music]

2590.97 --> 2594.2
[Music]

2594.4 --> 2598.42
I mean what are you gonna do with it

2596.5 --> 2601.38
anyway

2598.42 --> 2601.38
sedate people

2609.22 --> 2614.859
I mean it could be I mean they used to

2611.8 --> 2617.44
use it to knock people out remember like

2614.859 --> 2620.859
before

2617.44 --> 2623.2000000000003
like others sedations for operations

2620.859 --> 2625.66
right it's just yeah you can knock

2623.2 --> 2627.04
someone that's what it was also used for

2625.66 --> 2630.5789999999997
in

2627.04 --> 2633.42
like yeah the earlier years or the

2630.579 --> 2633.42
earlier centuries

2637.72 --> 2642.22
but yeah it is risky though

2640.06 --> 2644.64
like somebody can actually die from that

2642.22 --> 2644.64
as well

2645.819 --> 2648.9
if it's too much

2649.42 --> 2654.76
and if you have it too often then it's

2651.52 --> 2658.079
really damn brain damaging so

2654.76 --> 2658.079
yeah uh

2672.819 --> 2677.98
oh you see this first things to when

2675.3 --> 2679.6600000000003
doing this yeah no I mean chemistry is

2677.98 --> 2684.54
really easy

2679.66 --> 2684.54
it is you just have to know how to do it

2686.38 --> 2691.859
[Music]

2687.819 --> 2691.859
but it can also get messy

2699.16 --> 2701.8799999999997
right

2709.77 --> 2712.92
[Music]

2717.64 --> 2722.02
right now the greatest issue with

2719.8 --> 2724.54
chemistry is always the purity of the

2722.02 --> 2728.14
components that you're using it's always

2724.54 --> 2730.18
going to end up being an issue

2728.14 --> 2733.2999999999997
because if you just don't have good

2730.18 --> 2734.7999999999997
components then there's going to be

2733.3 --> 2737.2000000000003
issues

2734.8 --> 2739.3
and sometimes those issues can be really

2737.2 --> 2742.18
bad

2739.3 --> 2744.6400000000003
super toxic or something

2742.18 --> 2746.44
and then whatever you're making is just

2744.64 --> 2750.1189999999997
not safe or

2746.44 --> 2750.119
not healthy at all

2750.7 --> 2753.7
anyway

2765.119 --> 2771.04
I'm watching this for buying chemicals

2768.04 --> 2771.04
nah

2771.28 --> 2778.3590000000004
I don't think you you get put on a watch

2775.24 --> 2782.04
list very easily only when you buy very

2778.359 --> 2782.04
specific type of chemicals

2782.619 --> 2789.099
that are like more commonly known for

2786.76 --> 2790.3590000000004
being used in explosives and all that

2789.099 --> 2791.7000000000003
right

2790.359 --> 2794.859
or something that you can make

2791.7 --> 2798.0989999999997
nitroglycerine with like oh for yeah

2794.859 --> 2803.2
components that are typically associated

2798.099 --> 2808.26
with the fabrication of drugs

2803.2 --> 2808.2599999999998
or explosives so

2816.81 --> 2822.4
[Music]

2820.119 --> 2824.319
but I mean there are Tech there's even

2822.4 --> 2827.02
like lists for that out there is like

2824.319 --> 2829.42
okay these are the components that

2827.02 --> 2831.7
you're not gonna get easily

2829.42 --> 2835.1800000000003
and some you might need like special

2831.7 --> 2837.359
permission government permission for

2835.18 --> 2837.359
that

2838.72 --> 2842.9199999999996
and they would they need like they need

2841.3 --> 2844.3
to know what you're going to use it for

2842.92 --> 2846.96
ETC and

2844.3 --> 2846.96
yeah

2853.84 --> 2857.1690000000003
[Music]

2863.98 --> 2868.54
tonight if you've been having problems

2865.96 --> 2870.94
sleeping bro

2868.54 --> 2873.579
if you're having trouble sleeping you

2870.94 --> 2877.0
that's not the way to go

2873.579 --> 2879.54
I mean it's like narcosis

2877.0 --> 2879.54
that's

2879.7 --> 2884.3799999999997
like knocking yourself out with a club

2881.98 --> 2886.18
because you can't sleep I mean this is

2884.38 --> 2890.1600000000003
not a good thing to do that that's not

2886.18 --> 2890.16
there's other things you can do

2890.68 --> 2897.7799999999997
there's all kinds of herbal things out

2894.339 --> 2897.7799999999997
there that work really well

2900.339 --> 2905.319
if you're having trouble sleeping I I

2902.74 --> 2907.839
wouldn't just get into chemistry to

2905.319 --> 2910.74
solve it there is stuff out there that

2907.839 --> 2910.74
works really well

2911.859 --> 2916.7999999999997
but you're not just gonna make it as a

2913.839 --> 2916.7999999999997
no Vice chemist

2923.2 --> 2929.74
you've been making quality

2926.22 --> 2934.02
substances is expensive because you need

2929.74 --> 2934.02
expensive equipment to do it right

2938.49 --> 2943.6189999999997
[Music]

2940.74 --> 2946.839
I mean if you're really having like

2943.619 --> 2949.54
long-term sleep issues there are certain

2946.839 --> 2952.1
supplements that I could point you at of

2949.54 --> 2954.099
the various degrees of strength

2952.1 --> 2956.6189999999997
[Music]

2954.099 --> 2958.96
that I would try out before actually

2956.619 --> 2962.6400000000003
like trying to fabricate your own

2958.96 --> 2962.64
concoction if you know what I mean

2970.12 --> 2973.17
[Music]

2975.599 --> 2979.599
benzoyl dehyde

2980.619 --> 2983.94
I have no idea

2984.04 --> 2988.75
I mean ask Adam Adam he knows that I

2987.88 --> 2990.1600000000003
don't

2988.75 --> 2992.4

3001.7 --> 3007.0989999999997
I don't know it doesn't ring a bell even

I don't know what it is

3013.11 --> 3016.329
[Music]

3030.9 --> 3035.099
yeah that's the yellow Jordan

3036.48 --> 3040.579
thanks for the list yeah

3041.359 --> 3044.9
melatonin especially

3050.88 --> 3056.94
but there's like mixtures of these kinds

3053.94 --> 3061.079
of things like yeah

3056.94 --> 3064.079
Alex Jones Store the infowar store right

3061.079 --> 3067.7400000000002
has really good like a whole variety of

3064.079 --> 3070.619
sleeping eight products

3067.74 --> 3073.4399999999996
and I did like even if you just read the

3070.619 --> 3076.7400000000002
ingredients like what George Georgie

3073.44 --> 3079.76
just was listing like there is those

3076.74 --> 3079.7599999999998
things are in there

3082.5 --> 3086.119
I I just try that

3091.26 --> 3097.1600000000003
I mean it's not like insanely expensive

3094.44 --> 3097.16
even I think

3099.3 --> 3103.88
platter Sage so yeah I mean

3114.24 --> 3119.4599999999996
maybe you are highly object to ever

3116.64 --> 3122.42
buying anything from the infowar store I

3119.46 --> 3122.42
I mean I get it

3123.059 --> 3132.6800000000003
I just know that his products

3127.28 --> 3132.6800000000003
really tend to be very very good

3133.559 --> 3139.02
I've never needed sleep aid before

3135.66 --> 3140.5789999999997
myself so but I mean I've seen all the

3139.02 --> 3142.319
different type of sleep aid products

3140.579 --> 3145.5
that he has had

3142.319 --> 3147.96
because he's Alex Jones himself has

3145.5 --> 3149.4
sleeping issues which is not surprising

3147.96 --> 3153.14
at all really

3149.4 --> 3153.14
if you know how he lives

3154.02 --> 3158.46
so he's even had great the great

3156.24 --> 3160.6189999999997
products just for himself and others

3158.46 --> 3163.5
that also have those issues

3160.619 --> 3165.7200000000003
and they do work

3163.5 --> 3168.3
and then kind of like they wear off

3165.72 --> 3170.9399999999996
after a while and then you can just

3168.3 --> 3173.819
switch to another formula and then it

3170.94 --> 3176.099
works and you can even rotate between

3173.819 --> 3177.839
different formulas and then they keep

3176.099 --> 3179.76
working

3177.839 --> 3181.74
that's what Alex Jones has been doing

3179.76 --> 3183.96
anyway or at least that's what he said

3181.74 --> 3186.859
he had been doing when he was at very

3183.96 --> 3186.859

what

3222.24 --> 3227.4599999999996
I mean players do you have an actual

3225.3 --> 3230.3590000000004
laboratory or are you just like doing

3227.46 --> 3230.359
this in your garage

3258.5 --> 3267.2
sound should be the same yeah Georgia

3262.92 --> 3267.2000000000003
I mean did I say it wrong what

3288.66 --> 3291.66
okay

3292.46 --> 3301.099
all right anyways 17 watching wow

3321.78 --> 3328.8190000000004
melatonin yeah for me too I mean I when

3324.839 --> 3328.819
I had sleeping issues in my teens

3329.819 --> 3334.079
yeah melatonin

3331.74 --> 3336.9799999999996
that's what my parents gave me for that

3334.079 --> 3336.98
and it did work

3341.339 --> 3346.88
But like after my teens or

3348.78 --> 3356.2400000000002
yeah I think like around like when I was

3351.48 --> 3356.2400000000002
17 or 18 then I didn't need it anymore

3370.619 --> 3374.599

3493.92 --> 3498.38
oh did I say hello to Thor Casey

3501.54 --> 3504.5
hmm

3509.94 --> 3514.8
yeah yeah okay sorry Casey but yeah the

3513.54 --> 3516.54
risks

3514.8 --> 3518.819
another Tony's you don't want to use too

3516.54 --> 3520.74
much because you want body won't produce

3518.819 --> 3523.68
it enough anymore

3520.74 --> 3526.6189999999997
that's pretty much for any type of

3523.68 --> 3528.799
substance that you're gonna take like

3526.619 --> 3528.799
that

3529.2 --> 3533.46
that emulate

3531.299 --> 3535.5
substances that are normally produced by

3533.46 --> 3538.38
the body yeah if you just ingest that

3535.5 --> 3540.74
externally then your body's not gonna do

3538.38 --> 3540.7400000000002
it anymore

3540.96 --> 3546.599
it's also part of the reason why I

3543.24 --> 3549.359
stopped taking vitamin D3

3546.599 --> 3551.339
because your body does actually produce

3549.359 --> 3554.4
that

3551.339 --> 3557.7599999999998
when you're in the sunlight so if you

3554.4 --> 3559.38
use that and you start leaning on it

3557.76 --> 3562.92
like forever

3559.38 --> 3566.119
then you disrupt your body's ability to

3562.92 --> 3566.119
actually make it itself

3567.119 --> 3573.1890000000003
part of the reason I don't take it

3581.94 --> 3588.5
all right Nature Boy

all is well yeah I'm fine

3589.02 --> 3594.0
it's the best Restless weather outside

3591.0 --> 3596.24
but I'm fine and a bit exhausted from

3594.0 --> 3596.24
yesterday

3596.7 --> 3600.24
because the Flat Earth debate just went

3598.619 --> 3603.859
on endlessly

3600.24 --> 3603.859
it just never stopped

3608.339 --> 3613.2
I mean seriously I mean the flatter

3610.68 --> 3615.5589999999997
debates should be starting up in an hour

3613.2 --> 3615.5589999999997
or so

3615.9 --> 3620.28
if I'm getting on there and humble H is

3617.94 --> 3621.96
gonna come back and do that [ __ ] again

3620.28 --> 3623.94
I'm out

3621.96 --> 3625.98
I'm not gonna I'm just gonna do other

3623.94 --> 3628.44
stuff then

3625.98 --> 3631.92
because I I'm not gonna sit through that

3628.44 --> 3633.5
again if you give physically gives me a

3631.92 --> 3635.299
headache

3633.5 --> 3640.4
thank you

3635.299 --> 3640.4
anyway hey jedo good to see you

3653.04 --> 3657.66
oh 22 watching rights

3659.22 --> 3664.22
it gives me a headache yeah this humble

3661.079 --> 3664.2200000000003
age guy who's been

3664.92 --> 3669.619
getting on the Flat Earth debates

3666.78 --> 3669.619
through Discord

3670.98 --> 3676.799
there's a whole this it's a long-term

3673.619 --> 3678.7200000000003
issue because I he keeps on asking the

3676.799 --> 3680.7
same [ __ ] over and over and over and

3678.72 --> 3684.0
over again

3680.7 --> 3686.7
even though about that subject he's been

3684.0 --> 3691.04
given probably a preponderance of like

3686.7 --> 3694.4399999999996
six or seven full attention hours of

3691.04 --> 3698.22
explaining every single detail about it

3694.44 --> 3700.26
but the stupid wave function collapse I

3698.22 --> 3703.6189999999997
personally gave him an hour of

3700.26 --> 3706.559
one-on-one time to explain it and he

3703.619 --> 3709.859
seems to just have completely let it

3706.559 --> 3712.98
pass him by he just doesn't care

3709.859 --> 3714.0589999999997
and I am like personally aggravated over

3712.98 --> 3717.619
that

3714.059 --> 3717.619
he just ignores it

3722.16 --> 3725.16
uh

3728.02 --> 3731.17
[Music]

3733.98 --> 3739.76
do you know what he wants to ask what

3736.2 --> 3739.7599999999998
what what does he

3740.059 --> 3744.7200000000003
did ammo ever explain this point at all

3743.04 --> 3746.7
no

3744.72 --> 3748.98
his point is

3746.7 --> 3752.52
he believes

3748.98 --> 3754.7400000000002
that the wave function is literally a

3752.52 --> 3756.839
thing

3754.74 --> 3760.2599999999998
and not a description he seems to just

3756.839 --> 3764.359
refuse to accept that

3760.26 --> 3764.3590000000004
in physics there are things

3764.64 --> 3770.0
and things happening

3767.52 --> 3774.359
things being done

3770.0 --> 3778.619
and descriptions and those descriptions

3774.359 --> 3781.68
might involve math and he refuses to

3778.619 --> 3784.5
keep them apart he thinks because

3781.68 --> 3787.6189999999997
it's called The Knowing the witch path

3784.5 --> 3789.96
or the the wave function collapse that

3787.619 --> 3792.1800000000003
it is literally a wave function so that

3789.96 --> 3795.299
math is part of physics and he's just

3792.18 --> 3796.859
not letting it go and it's [ __ ]

3795.299 --> 3798.599
aggravating

3796.859 --> 3801.2599999999998
excuse my French

3798.599 --> 3801.26
ah

3814.319 --> 3816.5
thank you

3821.839 --> 3826.98
don't don't get all mysterious jado just

3825.359 --> 3829.319
say it then

3826.98 --> 3831.98
oh you know what you yeah

3829.319 --> 3831.98
what

3834.0 --> 3838.14
what is it then if you know what he's

3836.339 --> 3840.119
actually about

3838.14 --> 3844.5
because

3840.119 --> 3847.6800000000003
there's no I I've used my empathy a lot

3844.5 --> 3851.299
to try to figure out his motivation

3847.68 --> 3851.299
it doesn't have a point

3851.579 --> 3857.1600000000003
he's just being nitpicky and weird and

3855.299 --> 3860.7
warped about it and he's not letting go

3857.16 --> 3862.8799999999997
there is no point he doesn't have a

3860.7 --> 3862.8799999999997
point

3867.39 --> 3870.489
[Music]

3872.94 --> 3875.7200000000003
I know

3879.72 --> 3885.48
so he's into quantum mechanics who is

3881.819 --> 3888.14
mostly into Quantum eraser apparently

3885.48 --> 3888.14
you know

3890.04 --> 3894.599
been watching his presentations about

3892.5 --> 3896.22
quantum mechanics

3894.599 --> 3898.799
and

3896.22 --> 3901.5
he's not really looking into it other

3898.799 --> 3904.68
than that I think

3901.5 --> 3907.38
he's not proven to US during any of the

3904.68 --> 3910.859
conversations hours and hours of them by

3907.38 --> 3913.079
now all together he's never actually

3910.859 --> 3916.68
proven to

3913.079 --> 3918.6600000000003
have actually done research like through

3916.68 --> 3920.339
the vernacular of like oh yeah he's been

3918.66 --> 3922.44
reading this stuff actually about

3920.339 --> 3924.96
quantum mechanics in order to give us

3922.44 --> 3926.76
feedback about that and prove that he's

3924.96 --> 3930.359
done that no he hasn't

3926.76 --> 3933.119
the only thing he's done I think from

3930.359 --> 3935.46
what I can deduce using my senses my

3933.119 --> 3938.6600000000003
empathy is that he's just watched

3935.46 --> 3938.66
Quantum eraser videos

3938.819 --> 3945.119
and that's all he's riding on

3942.42 --> 3950.839
he doesn't understand [ __ ]

3945.119 --> 3950.839
he is not as smart as he seems at all

3959.579 --> 3967.38
he's careful his modest humble

3964.319 --> 3968.66

he isn't

[Music]

3975.18 --> 3978.29
[Music]

3978.359 --> 3983.72
I'm not talking about Quantum eraser I'm

3980.52 --> 3983.72
talking about humble age

3983.94 --> 3987.26
metal slugs

3987.9 --> 3993.6600000000003
Quantum eraser does know a lot

3990.9 --> 3996.299
he has a very good memory

3993.66 --> 3998.3999999999996
much much better than mine

3996.299 --> 4000.98
but my memory functions very differently

3998.4 --> 4004.039
I have a much higher pattern recognition

4000.98 --> 4006.52
I mean unfathomably higher than Quantum

4004.039 --> 4006.5200000000004
eraser

4006.7 --> 4013.7599999999998
yeah and even though he's not that bad

4010.46 --> 4016.16
but he is a much he's a much more

4013.76 --> 4019.8190000000004
studied man like he has read all those

4016.16 --> 4022.64
books and he remembers everything about

4019.819 --> 4025.7599999999998
having read those books okay that's the

4022.64 --> 4027.92
big difference Quantum eraser is not

4025.76 --> 4031.2200000000003
freaking dumb

4027.92 --> 4032.839
he is emotionally uncontrollable and

4031.22 --> 4036.3799999999997
unstable

4032.839 --> 4038.92
but his memory works just great better

4036.38 --> 4038.92
than mine

4040.4 --> 4048.44
and he does actually understand it

4044.9 --> 4052.2200000000003
and he critically thinks

4048.44 --> 4055.099
with himself has thought a lot about

4052.22 --> 4056.5389999999998
what he has learned and the the material

4055.099 --> 4059.1800000000003
that he knows

4056.539 --> 4063.2000000000003
so he's act he's mastered what he's

4059.18 --> 4066.319
known what he knows but that Mastery is

4063.2 --> 4067.819
really just that field and the

4066.319 --> 4070.2799999999997
preponderance of the material he's

4067.819 --> 4071.9
learned so it's kind of academic about

4070.28 --> 4075.8190000000004
it

4071.9 --> 4075.819
right I'm not academic like that

4078.26 --> 4083.6800000000003
I'm just about pattern recognition and

4081.079 --> 4083.6800000000003
communication

4088.04 --> 4091.67
[Music]

4094.34 --> 4097.55
[Music]

4103.04 --> 4107.839
if you guys always being creative Grand

4105.199 --> 4110.239
level so we assume containment why is it

4107.839 --> 4112.96
is pressure consistent and not

4110.239 --> 4112.959999999999
increasing

4114.44 --> 4122.12
well because it's also absorbed at

4118.88 --> 4123.62
ground level yeah let's see

4122.12 --> 4125.9
the most

4123.62 --> 4128.9
uh

4125.9 --> 4128.9
transformation

4129.799 --> 4137.42
of gas and from gas into liquid so it

4135.259 --> 4140.6
happens at ground level

4137.42 --> 4143.319
so yeah it is the gas creation happens

4140.6 --> 4145.819
at ground level but gas

4143.319 --> 4147.7390000000005
uncreation like transformation into

4145.819 --> 4151.580000000001
something else also happens at ground

4147.739 --> 4153.678999999999
level right there's no transformation

4151.58 --> 4156.14
happening way up there

4153.679 --> 4157.819
whatever is up there is just sitting up

4156.14 --> 4159.319
there

4157.819 --> 4161.900000000001
mostly

4159.319 --> 4163.9400000000005
unless there's some weird electrical

4161.9 --> 4164.9
process Way Out Of Reach or something

4163.94 --> 4166.759
but

4164.9 --> 4168.679
on average there's very little reaction

4166.759 --> 4170.719
because it's just gas sitting there in

4168.679 --> 4174.02
an expanded State well at the ground

4170.719 --> 4176.4800000000005
level gas is being created

4174.02 --> 4179.42
where there was no gas before eh but

4176.48 --> 4182.678999999999
it's also being absorbed and transformed

4179.42 --> 4182.679
into non-gas so

4186.14 --> 4195.1
kind of a okay one big pundit

4191.48 --> 4195.099999999999
kind of an entry is that

4207.739 --> 4214.959999999999
yeah I mean why the [ __ ] would I brush

4211.28 --> 4214.96
my eyebrows I'm not a [ __ ]

4216.7 --> 4219.96
[Music]

4237.95 --> 4241.16
[Music]

4249.34 --> 4256.149
hey steamy traveler good to see you

4253.05 --> 4256.149
[Music]

4266.0 --> 4268.06
[ __ ]

4271.4 --> 4278.08
right so I hope I answered the question

4274.64 --> 4278.08
of your dilemma LSG

4281.179 --> 4287.86
now we're not talking about that's just

4283.34 --> 4287.860000000001
one big pond with a really awkward entry

4296.16 --> 4299.199
[Music]

4300.02 --> 4305.42
but yeah metal slugs Master yeah

4302.9 --> 4307.839999999999
gas creation pretty much only happens at

4305.42 --> 4307.84
ground level

4310.04 --> 4314.08
creation mind you I mean there's gas up

4312.38 --> 4319.78
there it's just not

4314.08 --> 4319.78
creating it's not forming up there

4321.8 --> 4324.820000000001
it's just sitting there

4324.98 --> 4329.959999999999
and eventually you could say like every

4327.199 --> 4332.12
piece of gas eventually finds every part

4329.96 --> 4335.26
of the container

4332.12 --> 4335.26
or at least theoretically

4336.5 --> 4342.88
and it will have a chance to be

4340.159 --> 4342.879999999999
reabsorbed

4343.159 --> 4350.799999999999
but all that reabsorption and emission

4346.719 --> 4350.8
all happens at ground level

4350.86 --> 4357.86
where also the heat is

4354.5 --> 4360.8
and heat is required for transformation

4357.86 --> 4362.42
naturally

4360.8 --> 4364.159000000001
right

4362.42 --> 4366.4400000000005
if it's all Frozen there's no

4364.159 --> 4370.96
transformation happening

4366.44 --> 4370.96
it's just ice sitting there usually

4372.02 --> 4374.620000000001
right

4375.08 --> 4381.62
there's no gas is happening when it's

4377.78 --> 4384.259999999999
all Frozen so heat heat allows

4381.62 --> 4387.5199999999995
emission and reabsorption of gas and

4384.26 --> 4387.52
that all happens at ground level

4390.08 --> 4395.6
dude what the [ __ ] is going on why are

4392.719 --> 4398.86
you joking about my appearance guys

4395.6 --> 4398.860000000001
what's gotten into you

4400.159 --> 4404.719
are you getting all trollish on me

4402.86 --> 4408.5199999999995
I'm trying to have a good conversation

4404.719 --> 4408.52
here with interesting subjects

4409.64 --> 4414.280000000001
why are you going all troll on me I

4411.8 --> 4414.28
don't like this

4422.86 --> 4429.58
is the pressure consistent if we have

4425.42 --> 4429.58
gas pressure gradient yes

4438.08 --> 4443.96
right

4440.179 --> 4446.3
if you have an aquarium with a amount of

4443.96 --> 4448.28
gas pressure in there and you put a hot

4446.3 --> 4451.219
a heat element on one side and a cold

4448.28 --> 4453.0199999999995
element on the other side in that same

4451.219 --> 4456.38
singular pressure

4453.02 --> 4458.900000000001
the gas is going to gradiate between

4456.38 --> 4460.04
the Heat and the coal element it just

4458.9 --> 4462.259999999999
does

4460.04 --> 4464.92
still the same pressure it's just

4462.26 --> 4468.4400000000005
there's other influences on top of it

4464.92 --> 4472.36
that will cause it to gradiate

4468.44 --> 4472.36
this just happens it just does

4487.84 --> 4491.78
see that's what happens thanks a lot

4490.34 --> 4494.4800000000005
guys

4491.78 --> 4497.54
thanks a lot for just sitting here in my

4494.48 --> 4499.94
show and being bored in chat

4497.54 --> 4502.12
now you summon trolls thanks a [ __ ]

4499.94 --> 4502.12
lot

4524.08 --> 4527.32
gas pressure

4529.64 --> 4534.219
less at ground level and there's no

4531.679 --> 4534.219
vegetation

4535.219 --> 4537.82
no

4542.48 --> 4545.739
not necessarily

4546.5 --> 4551.659
well look the thing is if there is

4549.32 --> 4554.42
vegetation then usually there's more

4551.659 --> 4556.759999999999
heat absorbed

4554.42 --> 4560.4800000000005
so it's cooler when there's vegetation

4556.76 --> 4563.2390000000005
compared to well an open desert

4560.48 --> 4565.639999999999
so in that sense yeah the just the raw

4563.239 --> 4568.879999999999
heat and none of it being cooled off

4565.64 --> 4570.860000000001
because there's no vegetation will cause

4568.88 --> 4573.28
the air to be thinner there because it's

4570.86 --> 4573.28
hotter

4580.34 --> 4585.66
I think

4582.8 --> 4588.899
more pressured but thinner

4585.66 --> 4588.898999999999
[Music]

4625.94 --> 4630.759999999999
so are you seeing creation

4627.38 --> 4630.76
transformation or both

4631.1 --> 4636.14
well

4632.56 --> 4638.3
created at ground level well it's not

4636.14 --> 4639.62
just appearing out at nothing in that

4638.3 --> 4643.06
sense so yeah it's going to be

4639.62 --> 4643.0599999999995
transformation of course

4662.36 --> 4667.699
bro one big Point are you on drugs or

4666.02 --> 4669.26
something what the [ __ ] up with you

4667.699 --> 4671.48
man

4669.26 --> 4674.5
what are you just incoherently

4671.48 --> 4674.5
blabbering about

4681.88 --> 4685.079
[Music]

4689.03 --> 4693.679
[Music]

4690.8 --> 4694.53
oh thanks thanks a lot for showing up

4693.679 --> 4696.14
high

4694.53 --> 4699.86
[Music]

4696.14 --> 4700.610000000001
in my early bird classroom Workshop show

4699.86 --> 4702.139999999999
thanks a lot

4700.61 --> 4705.21
[Music]

4702.14 --> 4706.780000000001
yeah just keep in the background okay

4705.21 --> 4711.02
[Music]

4706.78 --> 4713.5599999999995
I don't need nonsense in my chat thank

4711.02 --> 4713.56
you very much

4713.88 --> 4717.05
[Music]

4738.62 --> 4741.94
yeah you don't need anything

4772.4 --> 4779.36
more weird

4775.52 --> 4782.780000000001
original lighter Sage okay

4779.36 --> 4783.679
but no the ozone gases there is no ozone

4782.78 --> 4785.84
layer

4783.679 --> 4787.52
I do not believe it at all it's it's

4785.84 --> 4790.46
just a complete

4787.52 --> 4791.42
nonsense fabrication there is no ozone

4790.46 --> 4794.179
layer

4791.42 --> 4797.84
that doesn't exist it's no logical

4794.179 --> 4799.159
reason for there to be ozone at that

4797.84 --> 4802.400000000001
height at all

4799.159 --> 4805.219
this be separated like that

4802.4 --> 4807.799999999999
because gas doesn't separate in layers

4805.219 --> 4810.62
and besides ozone

4807.8 --> 4814.46
is much denser

4810.62 --> 4816.5599999999995
than where that would allegedly be the

4814.46 --> 4820.219
ozone layer okay because that's like

4816.56 --> 4823.820000000001
helium hydrogen territory ozone is

4820.219 --> 4827.42
literally three oxygen atoms that's much

4823.82 --> 4830.36
denser it's not gonna form together

4827.42 --> 4831.679
there that makes absolutely no sense

4830.36 --> 4834.199
[Music]

4831.679 --> 4837.5
there is no ozone layer

4834.199 --> 4839.178999999999
there's ozone at ground level like when

4837.5 --> 4841.159
lightning storms happen that's when

4839.179 --> 4844.82
ozone forms

4841.159 --> 4847.46
a lot typically as well you smell it

4844.82 --> 4849.92
they're during rainstorms

4847.46 --> 4851.36
then you smell it like it smells like a

4849.92 --> 4854.54
bit of ozone

4851.36 --> 4859.219
yeah at ground level

4854.54 --> 4862.82
among the other dense gases not way up

4859.219 --> 4865.76
there among the super low density gases

4862.82 --> 4867.62
that makes no sense at all

4865.76 --> 4869.659000000001
it's not gonna sit there

4867.62 --> 4872.14
how did it even get there none of it

4869.659 --> 4872.139999999999
makes sense

4880.1 --> 4885.1
[Music]

4882.58 --> 4888.94
yeah maybe we should just

4885.1 --> 4888.9400000000005
put that in title

4897.86 --> 4904.28
it's complete horse [ __ ]

4901.219 --> 4907.159
every supposed piece of data about it is

4904.28 --> 4909.92
complete horseshit

4907.159 --> 4912.32
oh no look at all the radiation in this

4909.92 --> 4916.219
location because of the ocean layer all

4912.32 --> 4919.639999999999
made up horse [ __ ] complete and utter

4916.219 --> 4923.26
fabrication there is no thing like that

4919.64 --> 4923.26
it's ridiculous

4925.46 --> 4927.64
thank you

4939.44 --> 4942.86
no audio for you yeah that's your

4941.36 --> 4945.219
problem because there's definitely audio

4942.86 --> 4945.219
here

4947.47 --> 4954.14
[Music]

4958.28 --> 4967.4
it's not just oxygen steamy Traveler

4962.36 --> 4969.5599999999995
it's a molecule right oxygen is an atom

4967.4 --> 4972.86
like a singular thing right and a

4969.56 --> 4977.84
typically chemically binds itself as O2

4972.86 --> 4981.38
that's how oxygen separately goes around

4977.84 --> 4983.84
O2 that's a molecule that's two oxygen

4981.38 --> 4985.0
atoms right that's how it typically goes

4983.84 --> 4988.159000000001
around

4985.0 --> 4990.739
but then there's ozone

4988.159 --> 4993.92
ozone is O3

4990.739 --> 4996.919999999999
it's a different molecule

4993.92 --> 4998.659
it's still oxygen atoms but it's a

4996.92 --> 5001.06
different molecule it does different

4998.659 --> 5003.96
things had different properties

5001.06 --> 5003.96
that's the difference

5007.179 --> 5011.46
it smells different has a different

5008.679 --> 5011.46
influence

5013.06 --> 5016.7390000000005
ozone's very interesting actually

5021.94 --> 5027.159
a friend of mine used to make ozone

5024.52 --> 5028.360000000001
cream it would have like an ozone

5027.159 --> 5030.82
generator

5028.36 --> 5033.9
that would literally like blow ozone

5030.82 --> 5033.9
through olive oil

5033.94 --> 5040.9
and then it would get all like

5037.42 --> 5043.06
syrupy like a cream eventually it was

5040.9 --> 5046.48
very funny and that stuff smelled

5043.06 --> 5048.280000000001
incredibly like ozone and that was it

5046.48 --> 5051.099999999999
had healing properties

5048.28 --> 5053.5
you could like put that stuff on a

5051.1 --> 5055.96
on a Band-Aid and just

5053.5 --> 5059.76
would work really well for healing

5055.96 --> 5059.76
that's what he used it for ozone

5061.78 --> 5067.3
and yeah my air filter which hasn't

5064.54 --> 5070.5
worked for years now also had an ozone

5067.3 --> 5070.5
generator in it

5071.38 --> 5074.9400000000005
because I do like ozone

5076.6 --> 5081.6
right and then it kills smells exactly

5083.21 --> 5086.409
[Music]

5091.42 --> 5096.159
it wasn't like especially when I I still

5093.76 --> 5102.58
had my cat that was really useful to

5096.159 --> 5105.219
have like that because yeah cat smell

5102.58 --> 5107.5
or like oh the cat like pisses on the

5105.219 --> 5109.84
carpet and I don't notice and then [ __ ]

5107.5 --> 5112.3
just smells like that but I don't really

5109.84 --> 5113.1990000000005
notice that much because I I will notice

5112.3 --> 5115.2390000000005
a bit

5113.199 --> 5119.199
but other people that aren't used to it

5115.239 --> 5122.86
will it will stink much more to them

5119.199 --> 5125.879999999999
so having that around really helped it

5122.86 --> 5125.88
really helped

5126.34 --> 5132.400000000001
so yeah ozone very useful but it's not

5130.0 --> 5135.4
just oxygen

5132.4 --> 5138.4
it's another molecule comprised of

5135.4 --> 5138.4
oxygen

5143.199 --> 5145.919999999999
foreign

5147.33 --> 5150.439
[Music]

5152.56 --> 5157.5
what are you doing here you're acting

5155.199 --> 5157.5
weird

5175.56 --> 5179.029
[Music]

5185.69 --> 5188.849999999999
[Music]

5205.42 --> 5212.92
liquid ozone is magnetic yeah

5209.8 --> 5216.09
but oxygen is magnetic also

5212.92 --> 5216.09
[Music]

5217.38 --> 5221.28
that's weird isn't it

5221.62 --> 5225.0599999999995
solid oxygen

5225.159 --> 5230.759999999999
is magnetic like

5228.04 --> 5230.76
it's weird

5244.6 --> 5250.1990000000005
okay because for some reason well oxygen

5247.179 --> 5250.1990000000005
is is like

5250.9 --> 5254.739
yeah

5252.52 --> 5256.860000000001
it's like metallic but it is in the

5254.739 --> 5256.86
metal

5258.1 --> 5261.3
it's just weird

5262.3 --> 5266.92
a lot of chemistry things are really

5264.58 --> 5269.92
weird and by the way

5266.92 --> 5271.3
so many things that are just like oh did

5269.92 --> 5272.62
you know this did you know that did you

5271.3 --> 5274.78
know this you could spend like a

5272.62 --> 5276.58
lifetime just trying to summarize did

5274.78 --> 5279.82
you know this about this material and

5276.58 --> 5282.6
that about that and that never ends

5279.82 --> 5282.599999999999

5304.239 --> 5308.5
why are you guys being so freaking weird

5306.699 --> 5311.32
in the chat

5308.5 --> 5313.84
starting to piss me off

5311.32 --> 5316.179
why are you all acting

5313.84 --> 5319.0
like you're just goofing around in a

5316.179 --> 5322.4400000000005
coffee shop or something

5319.0 --> 5322.44
[ __ ] is going on here

5334.239 --> 5338.5599999999995
did I learn a lot about chemistry during

5336.46 --> 5342.12
goldsmithing apprenticeship

5338.56 --> 5342.120000000001
no not really

5344.139 --> 5349.56
I learned a lot about well the

5346.239 --> 5349.5599999999995
properties of metal though

5362.58 --> 5369.719
what's wrong I just this where is clear

5366.4 --> 5369.719
why are you bickering

5383.92 --> 5391.659
yeah nukes are fake that's right doesn't

5387.159 --> 5394.659
exist big bombs exist nukes don't yeah

5391.659 --> 5396.46
dirty bombs also exist you know [ __ ]

5394.659 --> 5401.4
everything up

5396.46 --> 5401.4
with poison okay so yeah there it is

5402.4 --> 5408.339999999999
nukes don't exist yeah volcanoes do

5405.4 --> 5410.799999999999
exist it's just like what the [ __ ] are

5408.34 --> 5413.860000000001
they though

5410.8 --> 5416.08
and why is it there why does that keep

5413.86 --> 5418.9
happening in those places what's

5416.08 --> 5422.0199999999995
actually hating that lava

5418.9 --> 5423.94
and why only there yeah that's the big

5422.02 --> 5425.9400000000005
mystery

5423.94 --> 5429.659
yeah nukes don't exist you didn't know

5425.94 --> 5429.659
Nature Boy serious

5438.52 --> 5444.719
yeah they are volcanoes are a mystery

5440.98 --> 5444.718999999999
they're very freaking weird

5450.58 --> 5453.58
foreign

5458.159 --> 5466.599999999999
stop bickering about that please

5462.659 --> 5469.839999999999
atmosphere in a physics discussion

5466.6 --> 5472.54
context is an issue now if you're just

5469.84 --> 5475.6
having a colloquial conversation with

5472.54 --> 5479.08
somebody not physics related then yeah

5475.6 --> 5482.02
using the word atmosphere is fine

5479.08 --> 5484.48
because atmosphere has more than just it

5482.02 --> 5487.659000000001
is more than just a description of a

5484.48 --> 5491.799999999999
sphere-shaped error it's also about the

5487.659 --> 5495.4
feelings in in your location the

5491.8 --> 5497.5
atmosphere in this group right it's

5495.4 --> 5500.62
there's more applications than just

5497.5 --> 5503.639
physics for the word so please stop

5500.62 --> 5503.639
complaining about it

5525.46 --> 5528.58
foreign

5526.719 --> 5531.219
but seriously

5528.58 --> 5535.139
Nature Boy you'd never

5531.219 --> 5535.139
bumped into that ever

5537.76 --> 5543.1
because that's been like part of Flat

5540.46 --> 5546.54
Earth for a while for a long time since

5543.1 --> 5546.54
2015 pretty much

5558.159 --> 5564.879999999999
huh you never heard that before wow okay

5561.94 --> 5568.62
well there's there's plenty of videos

5564.88 --> 5568.62
about it if you want to look into it

5568.659 --> 5574.78
I'd start with like an Eric Dubai video

5571.96 --> 5577.78
he's made because he has really concise

5574.78 --> 5581.679
well-explained videos about items

5577.78 --> 5583.42
including how nukes are fake so you

5581.679 --> 5585.639
might want to start there before you go

5583.42 --> 5586.54
into people's wild speculations and all

5585.639 --> 5588.28
that

5586.54 --> 5589.96
[Music]

5588.28 --> 5592.84
only been on the scene for about a year

5589.96 --> 5596.46
okay well yeah there's a lot Nature Boy

5592.84 --> 5596.46
there's a lot of things

5596.86 --> 5600.9
there's a lot of fake things in this

5598.719 --> 5600.9
world

5605.739 --> 5611.28
books is one of them

5607.36 --> 5611.28
they are a political tool

5613.42 --> 5618.42
that's why it never happens is nuclear

5615.46 --> 5618.42
energy fake no

5619.48 --> 5623.86
nuclear energy is not fake

5621.94 --> 5627.28
but

5623.86 --> 5630.46
it's been graveled they have perpetuated

5627.28 --> 5632.32
a massive lie concerning how it really

5630.46 --> 5634.2390000000005
works and and the dangers of it

5632.32 --> 5637.12
especially because nuclear energy is

5634.239 --> 5640.799999999999
actually extremely safe

5637.12 --> 5644.5599999999995
and I mean extremely safe why because

5640.8 --> 5648.1
radioactivity isn't even the deal

5644.56 --> 5651.400000000001
the big deal that they say it is

5648.1 --> 5653.5
that's been heavily exaggerated

5651.4 --> 5656.32
now of course there are

5653.5 --> 5660.88
other issues like for example the

5656.32 --> 5664.36
substance plutonium is very poisonous

5660.88 --> 5667.2390000000005
right so people can can succumb just to

5664.36 --> 5670.0
the poisonous nature of some of these

5667.239 --> 5672.638999999999
radioactive materials

5670.0 --> 5676.48
but radioactivity itself

5672.639 --> 5677.86
has been like highly demonized

5676.48 --> 5680.259999999999
and

5677.86 --> 5683.139
there's like that we're talking about

5680.26 --> 5686.320000000001
specific nuclear radiation right

5683.139 --> 5688.78
well there's other forms of radiation

5686.32 --> 5690.28
too that are extrude that can be very

5688.78 --> 5691.96
harmful

5690.28 --> 5694.12
right

5691.96 --> 5696.46
but yeah

5694.12 --> 5699.099999999999
I mean basic uranium and all that and

5696.46 --> 5702.2390000000005
power plants it's so freaking safe like

5699.1 --> 5702.2390000000005
nothing's gonna happen

5705.639 --> 5709.6
and that's

5707.02 --> 5711.34
because it's so incredibly safe and

5709.6 --> 5713.860000000001
efficient and durable

5711.34 --> 5716.1990000000005
that's why this fear story is

5713.86 --> 5718.12
surrounding it right

5716.199 --> 5721.12
so that

5718.12 --> 5722.739
the Empire has an excuse to basically go

5721.12 --> 5725.199
and attack it

5722.739 --> 5729.4
to take it out to take out those power

5725.199 --> 5731.0199999999995
plants because they would relieve the

5729.4 --> 5733.599999999999
entire region

5731.02 --> 5736.360000000001
of energy shortage

5733.6 --> 5737.9800000000005
with barely any consequences and then

5736.36 --> 5740.759999999999
they just spin about oh but it could

5737.98 --> 5744.699
make a nuclear weapons with that

5740.76 --> 5748.3
it's all [ __ ] entire nuke industry

5744.699 --> 5750.4
is a 100 Bluff everything

5748.3 --> 5753.719
it's all Bluff

5750.4 --> 5753.719
they don't do anything

5754.3 --> 5759.58
if actual missiles are gonna fire

5756.76 --> 5762.46
they're just going to be missiles with

5759.58 --> 5763.96
big bombs perhaps there is no nuclear

5762.46 --> 5767.679
bombs

5763.96 --> 5770.26
it's all been a bluff an elaborate

5767.679 --> 5772.659
project of Mind Control starting with

5770.26 --> 5775.0
Oppenheimer and in that period when that

5772.659 --> 5776.339999999999
first started happening and was rolled

5775.0 --> 5779.02
out

5776.34 --> 5781.84
scientists at the time that would

5779.02 --> 5784.3
basically refute the notion that it's

5781.84 --> 5786.04
possible and all that and people that

5784.3 --> 5789.6990000000005
would go to the media and try to spread

5786.04 --> 5793.06
they were assassinated

5789.699 --> 5796.12
and it's known it's publicly known that

5793.06 --> 5798.04
that happened people that opposed the

5796.12 --> 5800.0199999999995
nuke narrative when they roll out with

5798.04 --> 5804.5199999999995
Oppenheimer and the destroyer of worlds

5800.02 --> 5804.52
those people were assassinated

5806.5 --> 5812.86
for speaking out against it because it

5810.46 --> 5815.5
was a mind control operation

5812.86 --> 5817.239
nothing actually did happen and there

5815.5 --> 5821.139
were plenty of people that just knew

5817.239 --> 5823.12
that they knew that from their own in

5821.139 --> 5824.9800000000005
the field testing and experience with

5823.12 --> 5827.5
physics and chemistry which is new like

5824.98 --> 5829.419999999999
this is a lie

5827.5 --> 5831.88
this is [ __ ]

5829.42 --> 5833.8
and if they spoke out about it they got

5831.88 --> 5838.5
assassinated

5833.8 --> 5838.5
okay that happened on record

5839.8 --> 5844.42
because it's all fake

5842.02 --> 5846.52
nukes are fake it's always been a mind

5844.42 --> 5850.4800000000005
control fear operation

5846.52 --> 5852.280000000001
a political strategical tool

5850.48 --> 5854.379999999999
because people don't know it's fake

5852.28 --> 5855.94
they're fearing that it's all gonna blow

5854.38 --> 5858.639
up

5855.94 --> 5861.5199999999995
we have to stop this or we're all gonna

5858.639 --> 5865.6
get blown up right it's pure fear porn

5861.52 --> 5869.1
just for the machine war machines

5865.6 --> 5869.1
keep on grabbing

5870.34 --> 5875.32
keep on playing

5873.219 --> 5878.26
oh and if you're part of the nuke Club

5875.32 --> 5880.12
oh you're allowed to use [ __ ] nukes

5878.26 --> 5881.679
narratives and have nuclear bombs and

5880.12 --> 5885.34
then that's going to be

5881.679 --> 5888.34
part of this the virtual strategy of

5885.34 --> 5890.62
nukes because it's all war games the

5888.34 --> 5893.139
whole nuke thing is war games it's

5890.62 --> 5896.5599999999995
ironic that there's a movie called war

5893.139 --> 5899.86
games about some guy hacking into the

5896.56 --> 5902.860000000001
Pentagon computer somehow and initiating

5899.86 --> 5904.299999999999
the war games

5902.86 --> 5907.54
right

5904.3 --> 5911.139
it's all fake they show it there in that

5907.54 --> 5913.12
movie In Plain Sight nothing happens

5911.139 --> 5914.5
they can't tell the different whether

5913.12 --> 5916.84
difference whether something is

5914.5 --> 5918.82
happening or not because nothing can

5916.84 --> 5923.62
happen it doesn't exist

5918.82 --> 5926.259999999999
there are no freaking nuclear missiles

5923.62 --> 5929.26
like at all

5926.26 --> 5931.96
there's ballistic missiles that just can

5929.26 --> 5934.719
blow something up

5931.96 --> 5935.92
but there's no nuclear bombs that will

5934.719 --> 5939.0
ravage

5935.92 --> 5939.0
the landscape

5939.04 --> 5943.78
or bring a nuclear winter it's all made

5943.0 --> 5946.92
up

5943.78 --> 5946.92
science fiction

5947.08 --> 5951.88
right nuclear bombs

5949.42 --> 5955.2390000000005
was the first real big science fiction

5951.88 --> 5957.52
move before the moon landing yeah came

5955.239 --> 5960.04
before that

5957.52 --> 5962.040000000001
the moon landing is so outrageous that

5960.04 --> 5964.06
that basically draws all the attention

5962.04 --> 5966.04
and people

5964.06 --> 5968.1990000000005
will be more inclined to figure out like

5966.04 --> 5969.84
yeah the moon landing seems this is a

5968.199 --> 5973.78
weird [ __ ] that's not that's not right

5969.84 --> 5975.6990000000005
but people don't have that response to

5973.78 --> 5978.82
nuclear bombs

5975.699 --> 5982.54
being fake they're just like

5978.82 --> 5986.219
what now I mean it's so real I mean just

5982.54 --> 5986.219
looks real and like what

5986.92 --> 5992.58
it's

5988.3 --> 5992.58
less overt triggery

5996.94 --> 6003.98
babushka's never let Chernobyl that's

5999.159 --> 6003.98
right because Fallout is nonsense

6007.38 --> 6013.02
right as long as the material ex

6009.8 --> 6018.679
excreted excreted during a scenario like

6013.02 --> 6018.679
a meltan isn't like plutonium dust

6019.08 --> 6024.62
like thick amounts of it then everything

6022.08 --> 6024.62
is all right

6028.199 --> 6033.0
right and any gases that might form yeah

6031.26 --> 6034.56
I don't know what happens to those

6033.0 --> 6036.42
really I mean

6034.56 --> 6038.88
they're set to just go up and then

6036.42 --> 6041.46
people kind of forget about it

6038.88 --> 6043.5
I mean is it really dramatically

6041.46 --> 6046.56
influencing things I don't know but

6043.5 --> 6050.0
Chernobyl itself is just it's crushing

6046.56 --> 6050.0
it's doing great

6051.179 --> 6055.9400000000005
and Fukushima by the way is also just

6053.699 --> 6055.94
fine

6057.0 --> 6060.78
do you realize that

6059.46 --> 6063.36
like

6060.78 --> 6066.5
fishermen are just still fishing in that

6063.36 --> 6066.5
in that region

6067.92 --> 6073.92
yeah there's no mega

6070.679 --> 6076.679
cancer situation happening in Japan all

6073.92 --> 6080.82
of a sudden in the East Coast

6076.679 --> 6083.6990000000005
because it's all made up horseshit

6080.82 --> 6088.5
you know what those elements are

6083.699 --> 6093.239
just blocks of material that exude Heat

6088.5 --> 6097.34
it's just hot yeah in that sense even

6093.239 --> 6097.339999999999
The Simpsons intro right

6099.0 --> 6106.139
with the with the bad guy with Homer

6102.679 --> 6108.54
literally just going around with the bar

6106.139 --> 6112.76
of Pluto yeah supposed radioactive

6108.54 --> 6112.76
material in his pocket because

6113.1 --> 6118.9800000000005
it's a joke it's just material that

6116.4 --> 6121.44
radiates heat and that's how they use it

6118.98 --> 6123.839999999999
and then eventually it kind of like

6121.44 --> 6125.638999999999
stops or transforms in slightly

6123.84 --> 6127.88
different material that apparently does

6125.639 --> 6127.88
happen

6128.219 --> 6134.52
and yeah then eventually I I I'm not a

6132.36 --> 6136.86
nuclear physicist as in I don't know the

6134.52 --> 6139.619000000001
details of that entire mechanism the

6136.86 --> 6142.86
physics of it and the material changes

6139.619 --> 6146.219
that supposedly happen

6142.86 --> 6149.28
but yeah plutonium is poisonous and that

6146.219 --> 6151.7390000000005
is also apparently what it kind of turns

6149.28 --> 6154.199
into eventually right and that poisonous

6151.739 --> 6157.339999999999
factor is the issue

6154.199 --> 6157.339999999999
that is the problem

6158.4 --> 6165.32
because it is extremely poisonous

6160.46 --> 6165.32
plutonia is really savagely poisonous

6166.32 --> 6169.04
I think

6170.1 --> 6175.02
maybe it's not even that terrible I mean

6172.92 --> 6177.119
there it's not like like

6175.02 --> 6180.119000000001
acute cyanide poisoning or something

6177.119 --> 6182.639
it's but it is like very it is still

6180.119 --> 6185.699
considered poisonous definitely

6182.639 --> 6189.679
why while uranium

6185.699 --> 6189.678999999999
really isn't all that poisonous

6191.219 --> 6196.02
unless I don't know yeah maybe like the

6194.04 --> 6198.48
depleted uranium thing

6196.02 --> 6201.6
that is really toxic

6198.48 --> 6205.08
why because well it will be literally

6201.6 --> 6208.679
plutonium shards exploding

6205.08 --> 6211.26
so there's like plutonium or uranium

6208.679 --> 6213.2390000000005
dust then spreading and that might give

6211.26 --> 6214.92
issues especially if it's in freaking

6213.239 --> 6219.619
War scenarios which are already

6214.92 --> 6219.619
traumatic on top of that right

6220.38 --> 6224.6
but

6222.48 --> 6227.5199999999995
yeah

6224.6 --> 6230.04
the whole radioactivity and nuclear

6227.52 --> 6232.139
bombs it's been blown out of proportions

6230.04 --> 6234.78
as a mind control scheme

6232.139 --> 6238.4400000000005
political

6234.78 --> 6243.0599999999995
it's part of the Beast system

6238.44 --> 6246.178999999999
it's part of the priest War

6243.06 --> 6249.84
right of those that are into that scam

6246.179 --> 6252.179
of pretending like nukes exist

6249.84 --> 6254.58
they're in with each other with it even

6252.179 --> 6258.6
though they might literally be enemies

6254.58 --> 6260.5199999999995
they will uphold that story because of

6258.6 --> 6263.1
what they do and they wouldn't know what

6260.52 --> 6267.6
to do if they stopped rolling with the

6263.1 --> 6271.04
story they've invested in it literally

6267.6 --> 6271.04
there's money invested

6271.26 --> 6277.4400000000005
in upholding that story and making

6273.54 --> 6279.36
people believe that it's real

6277.44 --> 6282.78
so there is like it is a Mind Control

6279.36 --> 6284.159
Function for for big geopolitical

6282.78 --> 6286.739
scenarios

6284.159 --> 6289.92
but there's no actual bombs

6286.739 --> 6292.0199999999995
if a real war really breaks out there's

6289.92 --> 6296.1
never going to be nukes being launched

6292.02 --> 6298.4400000000005
it will always come down to artillery

6296.1 --> 6301.56
just ballistic missiles blowing up

6298.44 --> 6303.9
buildings and things like tanks and

6301.56 --> 6306.780000000001
maybe aircraft carriers jet strike

6303.9 --> 6311.599999999999
there's always going to be that

6306.78 --> 6311.599999999999
because nukes don't exist yeah

6319.26 --> 6324.4400000000005
and be glad be glad they don't exist

6329.04 --> 6333.96
5G directed weapons real or fake yeah

6332.58 --> 6336.48
they're real

6333.96 --> 6340.5
but they're not being used like that at

6336.48 --> 6344.339999999999
least not the G 5G Towers but they have

6340.5 --> 6344.34
that capability yes

6346.5 --> 6351.54
and maybe in some regions in certain

6348.96 --> 6354.6
times they suddenly do like turn on it

6351.54 --> 6357.179
as a weapon but you'll freaking notice

6354.6 --> 6358.139
and maybe they have done that here and

6357.179 --> 6361.4
there

6358.139 --> 6361.400000000001
but not in general

6364.679 --> 6369.4800000000005
it's not like it's always on or anything

6367.159 --> 6371.5199999999995
it's just like

6369.48 --> 6376.04
they're just devices and they have this

6371.52 --> 6376.040000000001
option that you can do that with it

6377.52 --> 6381.719
right but at the same time there's

6379.199 --> 6385.04
similar Technologies well are used in

6381.719 --> 6385.04
the directed energy weapons

6394.5 --> 6398.76
thank you

6396.239 --> 6401.419999999999
do you deny nukes could ever exist at

6398.76 --> 6401.42
all yes

6403.139 --> 6408.119
they can't it's a myth it's based on a

6406.139 --> 6410.159000000001
myth yeah

6408.119 --> 6412.5599999999995
like it's like

6410.159 --> 6415.5
a myth of a super chemical reaction

6412.56 --> 6417.2390000000005
right chemical reaction explosion it

6415.5 --> 6420.179
Cascade boom boom boom boom boom boom

6417.239 --> 6422.5199999999995
and then it all just explodes or

6420.179 --> 6427.02
detonates even if it goes by a shock

6422.52 --> 6430.639
wave and then they invented the nuclear

6427.02 --> 6430.639
fission explosion

6431.04 --> 6437.5199999999995
where instead of the molecules cascading

6435.179 --> 6441.26
reacting with each other creating all

6437.52 --> 6443.52
that energy it's the the the

6441.26 --> 6446.34
subatomic things

6443.52 --> 6449.159000000001
breaking other atoms apart into more

6446.34 --> 6451.619000000001
subatomic things and then cascading on a

6449.159 --> 6454.0199999999995
super super super duper chemical

6451.619 --> 6456.9
reaction that's basically what Atomic

6454.02 --> 6459.84
fission is supposed to be it's the super

6456.9 --> 6461.879999999999
chemical reaction it's all made up

6459.84 --> 6464.1
it doesn't happen

6461.88 --> 6467.76
there is no critical mass

6464.1 --> 6470.659000000001
for material like plutonium or uranium

6467.76 --> 6474.360000000001
you put it together and then

6470.659 --> 6477.0199999999995
that's [ __ ] it's completely

6474.36 --> 6477.0199999999995
made up

6477.6 --> 6482.820000000001
completely made up

6480.179 --> 6485.04
doesn't happen

6482.82 --> 6487.86
the worst thing that will happen is that

6485.04 --> 6490.199
it just kind of overheats each other

6487.86 --> 6492.299999999999
like bars or whatever and then it might

6490.199 --> 6495.239
go melting and then yeah that's kind of

6492.3 --> 6497.58
in it's like what do you do with that

6495.239 --> 6501.178999999999
problematic

6497.58 --> 6504.36
it might even be toxic is not going to

6501.179 --> 6506.4
give a fission explosion that doesn't

6504.36 --> 6508.44
exist right and even like the explosion

6506.4 --> 6509.94
that we saw at Fukushima when that

6508.44 --> 6512.58
happened

6509.94 --> 6517.678999999999
that wasn't a nuclear explosion that was

6512.58 --> 6519.719
a hydrogen explosion yeah because

6517.679 --> 6523.4400000000005
this stuff

6519.719 --> 6525.96
can actually split apart water and then

6523.44 --> 6530.759999999999
it will turn it into hydrogen and oxygen

6525.96 --> 6534.42
which yeah are extremely explosive so

6530.76 --> 6535.9800000000005
that explosion is just hydrogen oxygen

6534.42 --> 6538.76
buildup

6535.98 --> 6538.759999999999
and

6544.98 --> 6551.36
are you guys still with me

6547.5 --> 6551.36
freaking internet disconnected again

6552.48 --> 6556.638999999999
ah yeah right where was I

6568.26 --> 6570.860000000001
foreign

6575.78 --> 6580.619
did you get about that but Fukushima

6578.639 --> 6583.52
that explosion was a hydrogen explosion

6580.619 --> 6583.5199999999995
that happens

6584.88 --> 6590.639
right that's probably by the way also

6587.52 --> 6592.26
what happened at Chernobyl

6590.639 --> 6594.179
there's going to be explosion like that

6592.26 --> 6598.26
it's going to be a hydrogen explosion

6594.179 --> 6601.02
not a nuclear explosion

6598.26 --> 6603.56
not a fission reaction because that

6601.02 --> 6603.56
doesn't happen

6609.36 --> 6614.759999999999
right anyway man time has flown

6613.199 --> 6616.799999999999
I'm gonna take a two minute break and

6614.76 --> 6619.159000000001
then I'm gonna run out of the show be

6616.8 --> 6619.159000000001
right back

6654.719 --> 6657.32
foreign

6716.639 --> 6724.46
yeah hope you guys have enjoyed the show

6720.179 --> 6724.46
so far because I'm gonna round it out

6726.9 --> 6731.4
all right should I put nukes also in the

6729.179 --> 6734.9
subject

6731.4 --> 6734.9
did talk about that

6735.78 --> 6738.5599999999995
uh

6743.6 --> 6746.9890000000005
[Music]

6748.79 --> 6752.069
[Applause]

6757.99 --> 6763.8
[Music]

6760.619 --> 6766.139
right yeah put that in there

6763.8 --> 6767.820000000001
goes on layer myth and nuclear fission

6766.139 --> 6771.42
is fake

6767.82 --> 6774.44
here we go it fits

6771.42 --> 6774.4400000000005
right so yeah

6774.9 --> 6777.5599999999995
is it

6782.52 --> 6786.9800000000005
Nature Boy I I hope you uh

6787.92 --> 6792.84
I was able to inform you about I'm glad

6790.08 --> 6795.0
I'm able to inform you about it hope you

6792.84 --> 6797.400000000001
were paying attention

6795.0 --> 6802.5
I laid down pretty much the rough

6797.4 --> 6805.638999999999
outlining of of yeah of the fake nukes

6802.5 --> 6805.639
hope that helped

6810.84 --> 6815.76
me yeah well you should have watched the

6813.659 --> 6818.099999999999
show when I was talking about that then

6815.76 --> 6820.38
not in the last minute when I'm gonna

6818.1 --> 6822.900000000001
rhyme out

6820.38 --> 6826.38
uh

6822.9 --> 6831.199
hey Blue Marble science hello

6826.38 --> 6831.1990000000005
you enjoyed the show okay good at you

6833.34 --> 6841.38
no Eric Dubai not Eric debates

6837.5 --> 6844.44
it's Eric Dubai Dubai

6841.38 --> 6846.619
is it a channel I'll link you up with

6844.44 --> 6846.619
him

6846.73 --> 6853.8099999999995
[Music]

6858.139 --> 6863.54
Eric right here here's his channel

6864.36 --> 6871.139
he's like a first he's a first wave flat

6867.719 --> 6875.159
earther so he was on it dude I've had

6871.139 --> 6879.3
Visions about him in like 2011.

6875.159 --> 6880.619
what the [ __ ] I he's a pretty prominent

6879.3 --> 6882.719
role

6880.619 --> 6884.82
in the flatter scene

6882.719 --> 6886.9800000000005
and he's went through a whole different

6884.82 --> 6889.38
all kinds of phases and all that so it's

6886.98 --> 6891.659
interesting right anyway

6889.38 --> 6893.639

early bird number 1515 on a Saturday so

6949.679 --> 6953.34
it will be 2 p.m Amsterdam time and I

6952.08 --> 6955.26
will of course join the Flat Earth

6953.34 --> 6956.3
debates over at Nathan Oakley 1980

6955.26 --> 6959.219
Channel

6956.3 --> 6962.04
which should start up any minute now

6959.219 --> 6966.52
