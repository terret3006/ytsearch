right whether today is

86.52 --> 92.46
well not rainy but it is stormy

90.18 --> 95.22000000000001
so

92.46 --> 97.74
yeah lots of clouds

95.22 --> 100.02
a couple of spots of Blue Sky in between

97.74 --> 102.96
there but mostly just clouds and they're

100.02 --> 107.72
rushing by and

102.96 --> 107.72
winds blowing hard not so much rain but

109.079 --> 114.91999999999999
still very moist out there

111.96 --> 114.91999999999999
Restless

114.96 --> 119.899
I'm feeling it ah freaking camera

138.36 --> 144.78
trees down there almost starting to

141.54 --> 147.98
Blossom but it's not there yet

144.78 --> 147.98
taking its time

163.08 --> 167.59900000000002
hello Matthew Hall first in chat

167.879 --> 171.5
JD welcome

172.98 --> 178.98
it is Thursday the 7th of April 2022.

181.08 --> 183.86
hey

192.36 --> 194.84
all right

196.08 --> 200.70000000000002
I think I feel a little better than

197.819 --> 202.98
yesterday but I still have like weird

200.7 --> 206.54
cramps probably

202.98 --> 206.54
because of the restlessness

207.48 --> 212.159
I hope my show will be just better than

209.94 --> 215.7
yesterday because yesterday it just

212.159 --> 217.98
couldn't focus really not really

215.7 --> 220.7
hello Jeff gasshead

217.98 --> 220.7
see you

238.98 --> 244.319
right

240.78 --> 247.379
like to remind everybody that

244.319 --> 248.64
this is like the tougher Financial time

247.379 --> 252.26
of the month

248.64 --> 252.26
I could really use the support

252.959 --> 255.92000000000002
if you can

257.029 --> 261.0
[Music]

259.979 --> 262.68
right

261.0 --> 264.979
so yeah what have been you doing

262.68 --> 264.979
yesterday

265.86 --> 269.54
uh Flat Earth debate

270.66 --> 276.18
it's pretty cool

273.18 --> 276.18
uh

278.16 --> 282.02000000000004
yeah I missed me made by Jim Bob

284.04 --> 289.74
and yeah I'm watching Therma Romeo Novi

288.0 --> 293.36
again

289.74 --> 293.36
just going through it quickly

297.9 --> 306.0
I really like that series it's just so

302.88 --> 307.44
it's in so many ways just so incredibly

306.0 --> 310.08
honest

307.44 --> 313.5
and I like that about it

310.08 --> 316.44
and I like the main character

313.5 --> 320.16
who's like

316.44 --> 323.46
very high sense of honor and like in the

320.16 --> 326.52000000000004
Roman Empire format but just like really

323.46 --> 328.5
tight and I like that I really like that

326.52 --> 331.56
about the character

328.5 --> 332.23
and that he's so fiery and inspired it's

331.56 --> 338.519
just

332.23 --> 338.519
[Music]

340.919 --> 346.979
besides there's not really much else

344.34 --> 350.539
out there on Netflix

346.979 --> 350.539
this is really worth my time

351.24 --> 354.44
hello geoshifter

354.9 --> 361.19899999999996
right also

357.96 --> 365.29999999999995
some very odd Dark World memories

361.199 --> 365.3
concerning that have returned to me

365.94 --> 369.78
it's just

367.259 --> 372.47900000000004
I'm still trying to place when

369.78 --> 375.65999999999997
but I've been this sounds weird again

372.479 --> 376.86
very irwinian probably maybe you guys I

375.66 --> 379.74
don't know some of you guys might think

376.86 --> 381.6
I'd be making this up but I'm not trust

379.74 --> 384.36
me I'm not

381.6 --> 385.91900000000004
but I think that

384.36 --> 388.139
way back

385.919 --> 391.139
like perhaps

388.139 --> 391.139
97

391.38 --> 399.68
maybe later

393.72 --> 399.68
I experienced this series like

399.72 --> 406.38000000000005
except it was real life so it wasn't

403.38 --> 409.979
like cartoon and

406.38 --> 412.68
I was Lucius there

409.979 --> 415.699
and I didn't know basically what was

412.68 --> 419.88
going on but I bet I went through

415.699 --> 423.06
that show sort of partially

419.88 --> 426.06
and I still distinctly remember

423.06 --> 428.759
just being weirded out by

426.06 --> 430.86
like like these really old Japanese

428.759 --> 432.599
people

430.86 --> 435.47900000000004
and

432.599 --> 437.039
I was a bit paranoid which is so funny

435.479 --> 439.86
because

437.039 --> 442.74
Lucius in the series is also kind of

439.86 --> 444.06
paranoid every time he just wakes up

442.74 --> 447.419
from like

444.06 --> 449.34
or awakens in his dream in his dream

447.419 --> 451.139
time

449.34 --> 453.419
thing

451.139 --> 455.639
and gets a little paranoid and I kind of

453.419 --> 457.79999999999995
felt like that too it's so weird but

455.639 --> 459.72
they showed me that

457.8 --> 461.22
they showed me

459.72 --> 464.699
that

461.22 --> 467.52000000000004
and I think that yeah

464.699 --> 469.379
it's just so incredibly odd having those

467.52 --> 471.24
types of memories

469.379 --> 474.36
but also

471.24 --> 477.539
in many ways it was kind of pointless

474.36 --> 479.52000000000004
like going through that experience in

477.539 --> 482.28
itself was kind of pointless and

479.52 --> 486.18
distracting but it's really bizarre to

482.28 --> 487.85999999999996
then afterward like decades later

486.18 --> 491.34000000000003
realize like

487.86 --> 494.039
I literally experienced

491.34 --> 498.479
that cartoon character through their

494.039 --> 502.639
eyes without realizing it in a real

498.479 --> 502.639
like a real represented

502.8 --> 510.18
visual like the Holo deck not anime but

506.879 --> 511.379
real world but it was that it's so

510.18 --> 513.9590000000001
bizarre

511.379 --> 515.58
in this part of the reason also I I

513.959 --> 518.18
wanted to re-watch it because of that

515.58 --> 518.1800000000001
realization

518.659 --> 523.64
but again it is kind of pointless so

527.58 --> 532.0400000000001
low flutter Sage slo-mo moon buggy

536.64 --> 541.5
because yeah

538.38 --> 543.3
like how the character there's several

541.5 --> 545.16
scenes that I literally experience

543.3 --> 548.16
including that one where you get like

545.16 --> 550.4399999999999
gets like poisoned by the sake of rotten

548.16 --> 553.74
sake

550.44 --> 555.4200000000001
and he's like oh he's secretly an agent

553.74 --> 558.3
trying to poison me well guess what

555.42 --> 562.16
that's exactly what I thought when I

558.3 --> 562.16
went through that experience it's

562.2 --> 568.6800000000001
20 years ago it's so weird

565.68 --> 571.56
it's a weird remembering right and it's

568.68 --> 574.38
not a Deja Vu it can't be a Deja Vu

571.56 --> 578.399
because Deja vu's aren't

574.38 --> 581.3389999999999
like real actor like representation of

578.399 --> 582.36
cartoon experiences if you know what I

581.339 --> 584.9590000000001
mean

582.36 --> 584.9590000000001
huh

589.74 --> 593.94
right

590.94 --> 596.1600000000001
but since I'm having these types of

593.94 --> 599.8800000000001
weird flashbacks through my Dark World

596.16 --> 603.779
Vision I am often wondering

599.88 --> 606.42
when did like the makers of the things

603.779 --> 607.92
including this series when did they come

606.42 --> 610.1999999999999
up

607.92 --> 614.04
with the concept

610.2 --> 616.32
could it be that at the time I basically

614.04 --> 619.14
in the spirit Realm

616.32 --> 622.8000000000001
caught on to their idea

619.14 --> 625.38
and then like experienced it as if it as

622.8 --> 628.9799999999999
if it was me

625.38 --> 631.56
is that how I got all these ideas in the

628.98 --> 634.62
past about things that would manifest in

631.56 --> 637.0189999999999
the future because yeah when it comes to

634.62 --> 639.54
like media production when something

637.019 --> 642.86
comes out is like way after it was

639.54 --> 642.86
originally conceived of

643.079 --> 650.3599999999999
so I'm just wondering like

645.779 --> 654.6
when did like the writer of terma Romeo

650.36 --> 656.839
romane no way when did he come up with

654.6 --> 656.839
that

658.26 --> 665.0
yeah these are the type of weird little

661.079 --> 665.0
background things that I wonder

665.579 --> 670.8199999999999
just to try to figure out what the hell

668.399 --> 670.82
happened

670.92 --> 675.54
what is the Dark World Vision what is

674.64 --> 677.6999999999999
that

675.54 --> 682.3389999999999
I mean I wasn't like given an

677.7 --> 682.339
instruction manual when I got into that

683.579 --> 686.18
ah

686.76 --> 689.42
anyway

700.44 --> 705.5600000000001
right so yeah that's just a little weird

702.839 --> 705.5600000000001
thing that I'm

707.459 --> 710.18
thinking about

715.98 --> 723.86
right and by the way that that

719.639 --> 723.86
anime series is not the only one

724.32 --> 730.5600000000001
right but it is like one of the most

726.92 --> 732.5999999999999
remarkable but since it is basically a

730.56 --> 735.42
cartoon and I experienced it with real

732.6 --> 736.86
life actors now that's something you

735.42 --> 739.62
just can't

736.86 --> 742.2
just like say like oh it's just a Deja

739.62 --> 743.94
Vu you just thought it like no no no I

742.2 --> 745.62
literally experienced it in another

743.94 --> 749.399
format

745.62 --> 752.76
there's no logical explanation for that

749.399 --> 755.1
with like oh it's psychological there's

752.76 --> 757.2
just no way

755.1 --> 761.1800000000001
anyway hello

757.2 --> 761.1800000000001
Nathan Oakley 1980 good to see you

768.779 --> 776.22
yeah also I realized something about

771.959 --> 778.8
my weird comedy influence apparently

776.22 --> 780.9590000000001
the guys think I'm really funny when I'm

778.8 --> 783.12
not trying to make a joke but when I do

780.959 --> 785.459
try to make a joke

783.12 --> 788.66
then they don't think it's funny it's

785.459 --> 788.66
weird how that works

788.94 --> 793.7
I guess I just have to stop trying and

791.16 --> 793.6999999999999
I'll be funny

795.779 --> 799.279
okay fine

799.56 --> 804.3599999999999
I had this problem by the way even when

801.779 --> 806.1
I was much younger because people had in

804.36 --> 809.04
my teens even recommend like have you

806.1 --> 811.98
thought of becoming a comedian or like a

809.04 --> 814.62
stand-up comedian

811.98 --> 817.2
and

814.62 --> 818.579
I never saw that like I don't know how

817.2 --> 821.1600000000001
to do that because

818.579 --> 823.199
when I'm like trying to be funny it just

821.16 --> 825.48
doesn't work

823.199 --> 828.5999999999999
it's not something that's only recently

825.48 --> 831.74
that's in the past too it's like

828.6 --> 831.74
then it doesn't work

837.959 --> 842.7199999999999
no thanks geoshift there's already

839.76 --> 846.68
plenty of people out there doing that

842.72 --> 846.6800000000001
metaphorically speaking

852.959 --> 855.6199999999999
all right

861.24 --> 866.48
Yes dear shifter I know you're very

863.519 --> 866.48
easily amused

868.36 --> 871.48
[Music]

876.06 --> 879.92
yes you're Belgium I know

879.959 --> 882.079
thank you

889.079 --> 891.92
ah

905.22 --> 909.019
no you didn't Ethan Oakley

916.62 --> 922.68
most of us are not here for comedy

919.86 --> 924.779
now some of the trolls like to say they

922.68 --> 929.66
are here for the comedy

924.779 --> 929.66
but they always end up being the joke so

934.92 --> 941.04
man wind oh that's a nice piece of bit

938.94 --> 942.4200000000001
of sun there

941.04 --> 944.0999999999999
oh look

942.42 --> 945.899
[ __ ] sake

944.1 --> 949.339
look at how

945.899 --> 949.339
blue that sky is

949.74 --> 953.12
in between there beautiful

965.699 --> 967.88
foreign

980.94 --> 985.0790000000001
yeah no Chemtrails today too much wind

983.22 --> 987.3000000000001
well there might be but you just won't

985.079 --> 990.5999999999999
even spot it they'll just blow away they

987.3 --> 993.8389999999999
still do Camp trails and all our trails

990.6 --> 996.3000000000001
not necessarily chem but they they just

993.839 --> 998.48
do Trails anyway but then they just blow

996.3 --> 998.4799999999999
off

1000.86 --> 1005.12
I've seen Chemtrails being sprayed

1002.72 --> 1007.279
plenty of trails being sprayed plenty of

1005.12 --> 1009.259
times when it was very windy and they

1007.279 --> 1011.18
would just like kind of migrate and then

1009.259 --> 1014.44
spread out and then they're

1011.18 --> 1014.4399999999999
gone they still do it

1019.1 --> 1023.5400000000001
if it's on the schedule because I really

1021.56 --> 1026.059
think that the whole trailing thing is

1023.54 --> 1028.28
all schedule based They Don't Really

1026.059 --> 1029.12
adapt it to whatever the weather is of

1028.28 --> 1031.8799999999999
the day

1029.12 --> 1035.3799999999999
I just have this schedule thing that's

1031.88 --> 1035.38
what it really seems like to me

1044.6 --> 1049.76
I don't want to watch David Weiss's

1047.0 --> 1053.78
interview yesterday no

1049.76 --> 1056.96
it was posted in Skype and some of the

1053.78 --> 1058.52
guys watched it I couldn't bear it

1056.96 --> 1061.88
like just

1058.52 --> 1064.4
the first few seconds the face of that

1061.88 --> 1066.679
guy was enough to make me just like uh

1064.4 --> 1071.26
get away

1066.679 --> 1071.26
get away from me you freak

1071.84 --> 1076.24
yeah apparently with Professor Dave yeah

1081.38 --> 1087.98
only it attacks I'm not surprised I

1084.799 --> 1090.62
didn't even look into it

1087.98 --> 1093.74
it's just the entire vibe from that

1090.62 --> 1096.02
stream was terrible

1093.74 --> 1097.22
I already felt it like the first few

1096.02 --> 1099.74
seconds

1097.22 --> 1101.6000000000001
like this is terrible this is going to

1099.74 --> 1105.4
be terrible I'm not going to subject

1101.6 --> 1105.3999999999999
myself to this mental torture

1122.9 --> 1125.919
a Wrath

1129.86 --> 1135.02
hmm

1132.1 --> 1136.76
Chemtrails stopped you say well I hadn't

1135.02 --> 1139.82
really experienced that at all

1136.76 --> 1142.4
chemtrails I don't even like calling it

1139.82 --> 1144.2
I like calling them Trails because of

1142.4 --> 1146.96
the chem part we don't know what they're

1144.2 --> 1151.64
spraying literally nobody at this point

1146.96 --> 1153.14
actually knows right the chem is only a

1151.64 --> 1155.8400000000001
reference to

1153.14 --> 1158.3600000000001
analysis that was done at a very early

1155.84 --> 1161.78
stage when there was

1158.36 --> 1164.24
like provably Chemtrails where they

1161.78 --> 1166.039
literally sprayed chemicals and if it's

1164.24 --> 1168.679
been admitted even

1166.039 --> 1172.179
that they've done that I don't think it

1168.679 --> 1172.179
is standardized though

1174.679 --> 1178.7
I wonder if that has anything to do with

1176.419 --> 1181.2800000000002
reduced air traffic perhaps

1178.7 --> 1183.559
I'm just saying there was still planes

1181.28 --> 1185.72
out there that left drills I've seen

1183.559 --> 1189.62
plenty in the last two years

1185.72 --> 1193.88
as by the way my show literally reports

1189.62 --> 1195.6789999999999
because I show it every time

1193.88 --> 1197.9
[Music]

1195.679 --> 1199.94
so you could literally just go back in

1197.9 --> 1205.299
the shows of the last two years last

1199.94 --> 1205.299
like 600 700 episodes and see

1206.0 --> 1210.52
like yeah there were still trails

1212.96 --> 1219.26
uh also Rasta hat who was living in

1216.26 --> 1222.799
California had plenty of reports where

1219.26 --> 1225.4
it was all trailed to [ __ ]

1222.799 --> 1225.4
so

1229.7 --> 1233.3600000000001
where are you at by the way slow mo moon

1232.4 --> 1234.96
buggy

1233.36 --> 1236.7199999999998
what part

1234.96 --> 1240.46
[Music]

1236.72 --> 1240.46
the United States I take it

1257.299 --> 1261.039
ah okay

1261.5 --> 1267.46
it's not in your town

1264.44 --> 1270.38
right well look

1267.46 --> 1276.3400000000001
Chemtrails don't really get sprayed per

1270.38 --> 1276.3400000000001
Town usually they just cover regions or

1276.62 --> 1281.4799999999998
like they usually are just aimed at

1279.44 --> 1283.7
bigger city regions

1281.48 --> 1286.46
so if your town

1283.7 --> 1290.98
is kind of close to a bigger city you're

1286.46 --> 1290.98
just gonna get that as well

1292.22 --> 1298.82
but it's mostly the more

1294.5 --> 1301.299
population dense areas they get like the

1298.82 --> 1301.299
full treatment

1304.82 --> 1309.08
foreign

1306.08 --> 1309.08

[Music]

1319.61 --> 1322.6999999999998
[Music]

1324.32 --> 1331.059
what are you talking about one for the

1326.6 --> 1331.059
unit what fellow tribalist

1337.46 --> 1343.3600000000001
you mean Dave

1339.38 --> 1343.3600000000001
is he supposedly a Jew

1347.179 --> 1351.3400000000001
can he be more specific one for the unit

1365.84 --> 1371.539
oh all right

1368.9 --> 1372.919
oh yeah that's pretty pathetic then

1371.539 --> 1376.22
from Dave

1372.919 --> 1378.2
but I don't care look I don't care dude

1376.22 --> 1379.28
if he wants to make himself look like an

1378.2 --> 1381.74
idiot

1379.28 --> 1384.32
because of some fellow tribes men that

1381.74 --> 1387.98
he perceives to have in him that's his

1384.32 --> 1390.4399999999998
freaking problem I don't give a [ __ ]

1387.98 --> 1393.1
a failure is a failure I don't care what

1390.44 --> 1393.1000000000001
you did it for

1407.48 --> 1414.02
it like technically I think it like if

1410.72 --> 1416.0
it was if Dave was just at homing

1414.02 --> 1420.1399999999999
from the get-go

1416.0 --> 1425.799
then David should have just left said

1420.14 --> 1425.7990000000002
like okay I'm not here for this [ __ ]

1425.9 --> 1431.0
claim your apparent Victory because of

1428.6 --> 1434.08
your [ __ ] and I'm out of here that's

1431.0 --> 1434.08
what I would have done

1444.14 --> 1449.2990000000002
to be fair I would have just never gone

1446.659 --> 1450.38
on that like all those channels those

1449.299 --> 1452.4189999999999
people

1450.38 --> 1456.74
there's nothing we can get out of it

1452.419 --> 1460.8200000000002
just let them die just let them rot and

1456.74 --> 1463.7
spiral down further into insanity

1460.82 --> 1466.82
and double think and just let them die

1463.7 --> 1469.7
just don't get involved don't touch it

1466.82 --> 1473.62
don't go there don't try to correct it

1469.7 --> 1473.6200000000001
just let them die

1475.82 --> 1479.96
you're gonna get bored lose their mind

1478.46 --> 1482.6000000000001
and then they're gonna get themselves

1479.96 --> 1485.539
killed because they're [ __ ] insane

1482.6 --> 1486.9189999999999
and stupid and deluded so just let them

1485.539 --> 1488.299
do that

1486.919 --> 1491.0590000000002
don't

1488.299 --> 1492.5
don't start stirring up anti-flat Earth

1491.059 --> 1494.6
is like that

1492.5 --> 1495.919
unless they're like literally coming for

1494.6 --> 1499.6399999999999
you directly

1495.919 --> 1502.7
but yeah what do you do you don't go on

1499.64 --> 1505.46
their [ __ ] little platforms

1502.7 --> 1507.98
because this is what happens

1505.46 --> 1511.46
right so unless

1507.98 --> 1513.2
somebody pay David Wise like five

1511.46 --> 1515.9
thousand dollars

1513.2 --> 1519.4
I don't see any reason why he should

1515.9 --> 1519.4
have gone on there at all

1519.559 --> 1523.69
at all

see that's what they're doing they're

1605.0 --> 1609.62
taking the bad part of every system and

1607.94 --> 1613.539
then they fused it

1609.62 --> 1617.0
it is the ultimate political form of

1613.539 --> 1620.419
torturing everybody in your country to

1617.0 --> 1624.08
death slowly it's an implosion

1620.419 --> 1626.0
government it's the worst of all sides

1624.08 --> 1629.96
that's what they do

1626.0 --> 1632.86
right the only solution is to

1629.96 --> 1632.8600000000001
kill them

2141.88 --> 2146.619
at least

2143.619 --> 2149.56
if you [ __ ] these people up

2146.619 --> 2150.88
prevent that from ever happening again

2149.56 --> 2152.7999999999997
like

2150.88 --> 2154.119
filming at all

2152.8 --> 2157.599
yeah

2154.119 --> 2160.96
writing new documents also

2157.599 --> 2164.02
to basically make the second and a half

2160.96 --> 2167.14
amendment to clarify what it is

2164.02 --> 2169.24
literally for instead of just like oh no

2167.14 --> 2172.2999999999997
you could still interpret like oh we

2169.24 --> 2175.18
don't have to do anything no no just

2172.3 --> 2178.98
like no if leaders become demonically

2175.18 --> 2178.98
corrupt you kill them

2184.96 --> 2190.0
and then I'd come

2187.0 --> 2192.22
gonna use

2190.0 --> 2196.42
the intelligence and the Secret Service

2192.22 --> 2199.54
to trace down people like Mr soccer

2196.42 --> 2202.599
count man-made God what kind of piece of

2199.54 --> 2203.98
[ __ ] would call himself that yeah I

2202.599 --> 2207.839
trace you

2203.98 --> 2207.839
and then you get on The Blacklist

2208.48 --> 2212.079
and we'll see what's gonna happen with

2210.82 --> 2213.88
that

2212.079 --> 2216.76
right

2213.88 --> 2219.46
I'd probably implement the full

2216.76 --> 2222.4
communist power [ __ ] and just make it

2219.46 --> 2224.92
impossible for you to even interface on

2222.4 --> 2228.2200000000003
any form of Internet ever again

2224.92 --> 2232.9
so you can literally never

2228.22 --> 2234.9399999999996
ever say a single word in the digital

2232.9 --> 2237.2200000000003
realm ever again

2234.94 --> 2239.38
[ __ ]

2237.22 --> 2242.56
how about that

2239.38 --> 2247.3
yeah instead of political censorship oh

2242.56 --> 2249.5789999999997
he said the Batman words that's right

2247.3 --> 2251.7400000000002
now according to this political thing

2249.579 --> 2253.6600000000003
that's unrolling you can't do that so

2251.74 --> 2256.5989999999997
we're gonna burn them from the Twitter

2253.66 --> 2261.06
and YouTube blah blah blah blah yeah

2256.599 --> 2264.88
yeah I'd use that to go after the trolls

2261.06 --> 2269.339
yeah that's what I use it for go after

2264.88 --> 2269.339
the trolls and [ __ ] them up

2270.16 --> 2277.48
let's see how the behavior then starts

2274.72 --> 2279.8799999999997
to evolve from that point on yeah if

2277.48 --> 2281.26
you're not all demonically Unleashed

2279.88 --> 2285.46
[ __ ]

2281.26 --> 2290.5600000000004
governed by a bunch of beetles

2285.46 --> 2295.0
and insane gender dysphoric freaks yeah

2290.56 --> 2297.64
how about some real rules and strictness

2295.0 --> 2300.099
let's see what that does to you

2297.64 --> 2301.7799999999997
I think everybody by this time could

2300.099 --> 2303.04
really use that

2301.78 --> 2304.42
right

2303.04 --> 2307.0
I mean

2304.42 --> 2311.6800000000003
not for long and you're literally going

2307.0 --> 2315.82
to be erecting statues of Hitler

2311.68 --> 2319.3199999999997
just to have an inkling of a memory of

2315.82 --> 2323.32
what it is to be a strong

2319.32 --> 2326.38
hardcore guy to have some kind of

2323.32 --> 2329.56
figment of the imagination left of what

2326.38 --> 2332.26
it is to be a halfway dignified human

2329.56 --> 2335.7
being right everything else is going to

2332.26 --> 2339.1600000000003
be erased till there's nothing but gay

2335.7 --> 2342.0989999999997
nothing but gay right you do nothing now

2339.16 --> 2345.64
it's gonna be nothing but gay nothing

2342.099 --> 2349.3590000000004
but pedo you will never see an image of

2345.64 --> 2351.339
a child again in a non-sexual way the

2349.359 --> 2356.64
rest of your life

2351.339 --> 2356.64
you understand you [ __ ] scum

2365.73 --> 2370.5
[Music]

2367.18 --> 2370.5
hello one photo unit

2372.339 --> 2374.88
sorry

2378.339 --> 2384.7599999999998
I had something packed in there

2381.94 --> 2387.94
I was watching [ __ ] you

2384.76 --> 2390.5200000000004
and on Owens channels like they uploaded

2387.94 --> 2394.7200000000003
the ugh some

2390.52 --> 2397.8
readout of the protocols of Zion God

2394.72 --> 2401.74
damn it what

2397.8 --> 2404.02
that's so vile I think it's probably the

2401.74 --> 2405.7599999999998
fuel why I'm so unbelievably pissed off

2404.02 --> 2410.5
right now

2405.76 --> 2413.26
like so vile so vile I

2410.5 --> 2415.54
yeah they're right they're right there

2413.26 --> 2417.7000000000003
they're right there right there the

2415.54 --> 2420.06
target group yeah that's right that's I

2417.7 --> 2420.06
said it

2421.599 --> 2427.54
and just these [ __ ] little stop

2424.24 --> 2430.319
sentences in there like oh we're doing

2427.54 --> 2433.72
it for the greater good oh yeah we're

2430.319 --> 2437.2
systematically becoming robotically evil

2433.72 --> 2439.5
and mind controlling without Mercy

2437.2 --> 2442.96
were they greater good

2439.5 --> 2446.819
right right that's not [ __ ] double

2442.96 --> 2450.359
speak at all you [ __ ] freak

2446.819 --> 2450.359
God damn it

2452.52 --> 2455.7599999999998
sweating here

2460.359 --> 2463.2
ah

2464.42 --> 2468.17
[Music]

2469.119 --> 2476.2200000000003
oh thank You Bad Karma thank you oh yeah

2473.859 --> 2476.22
yeah yeah

2476.68 --> 2481.359
I mean

2478.3 --> 2485.079
you know all about that right I'm not

2481.359 --> 2490.9
disciplined at all I'm not virtuous I

2485.079 --> 2495.099
mean virtuous is doing useless [ __ ]

2490.9 --> 2497.319
so you think according to a bunch of

2495.099 --> 2501.88
[ __ ] priests

2497.319 --> 2504.52
oh you've fulfilled the obligations even

2501.88 --> 2505.7200000000003
though effectively it doesn't even do

2504.52 --> 2508.78
[ __ ]

2505.72 --> 2510.9399999999996
barely right I've been thinking about

2508.78 --> 2513.94
this carefully and this is the one thing

2510.94 --> 2517.06
that agitates me even more because that

2513.94 --> 2519.339
[ __ ] part these Protocols of Zions

2517.06 --> 2522.16
are actually right in they're actually

2519.339 --> 2524.2599999999998
correct about some things and that's so

2522.16 --> 2525.52
aggravating

2524.26 --> 2527.579
right

2525.52 --> 2530.619
there's a lot of Christians out there

2527.579 --> 2534.28
they're just systematically think that

2530.619 --> 2536.8
they can just roll into a program and

2534.28 --> 2539.76
that that's doing their good deed they

2536.8 --> 2541.8390000000004
don't know what the [ __ ] they're doing

2539.76 --> 2543.3390000000004
helping out

2541.839 --> 2545.7999999999997
people

2543.339 --> 2548.619
that have gotten themselves to that

2545.8 --> 2551.26
point where they're just broken and

2548.619 --> 2554.28
useless oh and you wanna you wanna help

2551.26 --> 2557.3190000000004
those poor people out that if just

2554.28 --> 2559.0600000000004
disintegrated for what how is that gonna

2557.319 --> 2562.18
build things up

2559.06 --> 2564.4
yeah it may it may feel a little good oh

2562.18 --> 2566.2599999999998
so it's such a nice person what is it

2564.4 --> 2568.6600000000003
actually doing

2566.26 --> 2570.88
what is it actually helping with I mean

2568.66 --> 2573.94
yeah you don't want them to just like

2570.88 --> 2576.1600000000003
die hungry in a straight corner right

2573.94 --> 2578.619
absolutely that's logical

2576.16 --> 2581.7599999999998
but there's just

2578.619 --> 2581.76
hundreds of years

2583.48 --> 2588.579
a bit to what end and the people they're

2586.839 --> 2592.839
helping

2588.579 --> 2592.8390000000004
they become megalomaniacore

2595.0 --> 2601.48
they think I got slaves

2599.2 --> 2605.74
literally

2601.48 --> 2609.16
the people that are being helped

2605.74 --> 2612.2799999999997
they're freaks

2609.16 --> 2615.7
they're Freaks and they abuse it they

2612.28 --> 2618.3390000000004
abuse it what good is being a good

2615.7 --> 2620.319
Christian you're helping this hoping

2618.339 --> 2623.319
that when

2620.319 --> 2627.0
how is it helping how is it helping the

2623.319 --> 2630.04
how is it changing the situation is this

2627.0 --> 2632.56
oh just give it to them right feeding

2630.04 --> 2635.319
the poor and I'm not saying that you

2632.56 --> 2637.48
again don't let people starve to death

2635.319 --> 2639.52
it's just really bad

2637.48 --> 2643.72
right if you can

2639.52 --> 2645.7
but just doing that and just oh just oh

2643.72 --> 2647.6189999999997
if you just read the Bible and you've

2645.7 --> 2650.98
replaced every critical thought you ever

2647.619 --> 2653.98
had with just that book and do as we

2650.98 --> 2657.52
tell you that it means right

2653.98 --> 2660.28
how is that helping how is any of that

2657.52 --> 2661.72
[ __ ] helping the situation it's not

2660.28 --> 2664.5400000000004
getting better

2661.72 --> 2667.72
it doesn't get better like that it's all

2664.54 --> 2671.2
a bunch of fake [ __ ] wannabe

2667.72 --> 2674.14
Christian virtue signaling [ __ ]

2671.2 --> 2677.14
and I'm sick of it

2674.14 --> 2681.7
I'm sick of having to face that

2677.14 --> 2684.04
and I'm literally weaning myself off the

2681.7 --> 2685.96
guilt that I experience when I face

2684.04 --> 2689.2
people that do that

2685.96 --> 2693.4
because of the realization that it's

2689.2 --> 2695.9199999999996
completely useless I mean the only thing

2693.4 --> 2698.079
it's actually useful for is for the

2695.92 --> 2699.52
individual themselves that they get a

2698.079 --> 2702.099
chance to like learn more about

2699.52 --> 2705.88
psychology and like how to manage people

2702.099 --> 2707.8590000000004
right for their own practical skill yeah

2705.88 --> 2712.06
but for society

2707.859 --> 2713.5789999999997
I mean is the amount of people that are

2712.06 --> 2717.22
getting old

2713.579 --> 2721.6600000000003
deranged and have serious mental issues

2717.22 --> 2724.1189999999997
and a drug addiction all that [ __ ]

2721.66 --> 2726.5789999999997
is it getting any less

2724.119 --> 2731.339
with all these nice people helping them

2726.579 --> 2731.3390000000004
out so are they becoming any less now

2731.44 --> 2737.339
or is it just

2733.319 --> 2741.579
more deranged people

2737.339 --> 2744.52
yes more deranged people oh it was so

2741.579 --> 2747.579
helpful you were so helpful you were so

2744.52 --> 2750.46
nice and good you you did as your priest

2747.579 --> 2753.04
told you now you good boy now you can go

2750.46 --> 2755.7
to heaven as the entire world grows

2753.04 --> 2759.339
worth worse because everything you did

2755.7 --> 2763.06
didn't actually help the situation it

2759.339 --> 2766.2999999999997
only helped you feel safe because now

2763.06 --> 2770.74
when you did it the priest told you now

2766.3 --> 2773.7400000000002
we can go to heaven oh yes

2770.74 --> 2773.74
yes

2779.2 --> 2782.16
ah

2788.859 --> 2794.98
Maybe

2790.3 --> 2797.5600000000004
maybe if you're just extra tolerant as a

2794.98 --> 2800.7400000000002
Christian extra tolerant of gays may

2797.56 --> 2803.44
maybe then God will be happy because you

2800.74 --> 2806.4399999999996
were so nice to the demonically

2803.44 --> 2809.02
possessed deranged people that typically

2806.44 --> 2810.839
get rage fits in how they want to

2809.02 --> 2812.74
destroy the world

2810.839 --> 2816.22
yes

2812.74 --> 2818.9399999999996
just be nice to the gays

2816.22 --> 2818.9399999999996
huh

2820.72 --> 2826.8999999999996
I mean it's not like it's just at a

2823.54 --> 2831.2799999999997
dead-on rule in there

2826.9 --> 2834.579
no no we got to be nice why because the

2831.28 --> 2839.3190000000004
people in the community told us that

2834.579 --> 2844.0
that's how we should interpret it yes

2839.319 --> 2847.18
that'll be so useful it'll be so good

2844.0 --> 2849.4
you feel nice and warm and fuzzy yeah

2847.18 --> 2852.04
you know there's another

2849.4 --> 2854.26
category of people out there

2852.04 --> 2856.66
that do things because it makes them

2854.26 --> 2858.28
feel nice and warm and fuzzy you know

2856.66 --> 2861.04
who they are

2858.28 --> 2864.8190000000004
facts

2861.04 --> 2867.52
they feel nice and warm and fuzzy being

2864.819 --> 2869.5
facts and being like a little kid oh

2867.52 --> 2872.14
look at the bright colors and oh we

2869.5 --> 2875.14
could just prance around you yeah it

2872.14 --> 2877.24
makes them feel warm and fuzzy too yes

2875.14 --> 2880.859
yes

2877.24 --> 2884.2599999999998
does it help anything doing that

2880.859 --> 2888.18
no no it doesn't

2884.26 --> 2893.44
they eventually get more bitter

2888.18 --> 2895.839
demonically possessed viable crazy even

2893.44 --> 2899.859
like suicidal and [ __ ] yeah that all

2895.839 --> 2902.46
comes eventually so what do you think

2899.859 --> 2905.68
that your

2902.46 --> 2908.92
mechanism being a church in

2905.68 --> 2913.8999999999996
doing as your priest tells you to do how

2908.92 --> 2918.339
is that any better than just being a gay

2913.9 --> 2921.48
as a religious atheist gay how are you

2918.339 --> 2921.48
any better than them

2935.859 --> 2939.42
yeah I know

2945.099 --> 2948.819
kind of person would fly into rage with

2947.319 --> 2951.22
somebody

2948.819 --> 2954.4
who doesn't take [ __ ]

2951.22 --> 2957.5789999999997
and says things that other people don't

2954.4 --> 2959.02
even hear anymore because they erased it

2957.579 --> 2961.42
because they thought oh that's so

2959.02 --> 2965.079
old-fashioned I mean we should do as the

2961.42 --> 2967.119
devil tells us and forget about our past

2965.079 --> 2971.6800000000003
forget about the lessons of our past

2967.119 --> 2975.099
don't get angry it's just progress

2971.68 --> 2976.839
it's just progress progress straight

2975.099 --> 2980.4
into hell

2976.839 --> 2984.46
yes I mean why would anybody get angry

2980.4 --> 2987.3
over that what

2984.46 --> 2987.3
why

2988.18 --> 2995.14
I mean just be happy we're all gonna go

2991.0 --> 2998.559
to hell just be happy and compliant and

2995.14 --> 3000.7799999999997
yeah look forward to things getting

2998.559 --> 3003.1800000000003
worse and worse and like to the point

3000.78 --> 3004.92
where you're literally gonna see with

3003.18 --> 3006.4199999999996
your own eyes

3004.92 --> 3008.94
kids

3006.42 --> 3010.7400000000002
they're literally like being their

3008.94 --> 3013.319
throats being cut right in front of your

3010.74 --> 3016.5
face on the street and them not getting

3013.319 --> 3018.599
arrested and them receiving Applause for

3016.5 --> 3020.88
that yeah are you looking forward to

3018.599 --> 3024.119
that you're looking forward to that

3020.88 --> 3027.059
because if you are then I don't see why

3024.119 --> 3030.0
you should have any rage fits right

3027.059 --> 3031.6800000000003
I mean isn't that just a nice thing to

3030.0 --> 3034.5
look forward to

3031.68 --> 3038.48
isn't that just brilliant I mean there's

3034.5 --> 3038.48
no need to be angry about anything

3041.94 --> 3044.839
tells you just

3044.88 --> 3051.78
be a nice and gay and don't talk about

3048.26 --> 3053.2200000000003
bad things that give other people bad

3051.78 --> 3056.0400000000004
feeling

3053.22 --> 3060.0589999999997
I mean that's great advice isn't it look

3056.04 --> 3063.9
at how evolved Society is now thanks to

3060.059 --> 3065.76
that look at how beautiful and advanced

3063.9 --> 3068.52
and intellectual

3065.76 --> 3071.78
everything has become thanks to those

3068.52 --> 3071.78
policies yes

3075.48 --> 3078.2
ah

3090.859 --> 3096.02
okay I'm gonna turn off sarcasm mode now

3097.2 --> 3103.98
before I can't stop anymore like Randy

3100.68 --> 3103.98
Marsh intercastable

3104.339 --> 3108.92
sorry

3106.38 --> 3108.92
I just

3134.819 --> 3139.5589999999997
I'm sure there are way more interesting

3137.04 --> 3145.14
people in Hell than in heaven oh Bad

3139.559 --> 3148.559
Karma so only one way to find out huh

3145.14 --> 3151.2599999999998
I should go try it out

3148.559 --> 3153.9
it'll be interesting

3151.26 --> 3156.059
Eternal suffering right

3153.9 --> 3158.52
Eternal suffering but at least there

3156.059 --> 3163.2000000000003
will be some interesting people around

3158.52 --> 3168.319
you to maybe distract you a little oh

3163.2 --> 3168.319
that's great man that's so worth it dude

3171.119 --> 3176.52
not that I actually even believe that

3174.48 --> 3178.68
entire premise I don't think there is a

3176.52 --> 3180.66
hell you can end up Eternal with eternal

3178.68 --> 3185.66
pain I think there isn't Abyss though

3180.66 --> 3185.66
where you literally just this disappear

3187.859 --> 3193.619
I think the only real torturous

3190.859 --> 3196.68
experience we get is actually during

3193.619 --> 3198.599
life and during the Judgment of our life

3196.68 --> 3201.54
in reflection to it

3198.599 --> 3203.6400000000003
that's where we experience hell

3201.54 --> 3206.16
what we associate with that I don't

3203.64 --> 3208.5589999999997
think there is a afterlife hell where

3206.16 --> 3212.66
you're literally it yeah drenched in

3208.559 --> 3212.6600000000003
that unless yeah you've become like

3213.78 --> 3219.599
just beyond

3216.14 --> 3223.2799999999997
recognizable as human anymore but then

3219.599 --> 3223.28
even then it like

3223.319 --> 3228.359
there is energy interaction and

3225.42 --> 3230.94
suffering it can't be eternal

3228.359 --> 3233.2799999999997
yeah this is philosophical reasoning I

3230.94 --> 3235.559
don't think it can be there can be the

3233.28 --> 3237.7200000000003
abyss and you just

3235.559 --> 3240.48
you go in there and you never come back

3237.72 --> 3242.7599999999998
and nobody even knows what's there you

3240.48 --> 3245.04
shouldn't want to know it's just gone

3242.76 --> 3247.079
they're not gonna reincarnate

3245.04 --> 3249.9
they're not in heaven

3247.079 --> 3252.559
who gives a [ __ ] let them

3249.9 --> 3252.559
just

3252.78 --> 3259.7000000000003
let happen to them in the abyss what

3255.66 --> 3259.7
happens in the abyss I don't give a [ __ ]

3261.34 --> 3264.489
[Music]

3272.64 --> 3278.52
but I personally I have a

3276.059 --> 3279.96
a religious belief it is a personal

3278.52 --> 3282.66
religion

3279.96 --> 3286.319
however the religious belief that

3282.66 --> 3289.0789999999997
this rage and this willingness to step

3286.319 --> 3292.2
outside of all normality and Convention

3289.079 --> 3294.6600000000003
and become absolutely brutal I think it

3292.2 --> 3299.22
is probably the key

3294.66 --> 3301.44
to the survival of the human race

3299.22 --> 3304.339
within the realm of the living I think

3301.44 --> 3304.339
it is the key

3305.4 --> 3309.6600000000003
because

3306.66 --> 3312.42
everything indicates that the opposite

3309.66 --> 3314.7599999999998
makes it worse

3312.42 --> 3320.04
right

3314.76 --> 3322.46
so in a weird way doing such things is

3320.04 --> 3325.68
almost almost

3322.46 --> 3326.94
resembling like the satanic effect where

3325.68 --> 3328.6189999999997
you'd have to

3326.94 --> 3330.42
deal with the devil and then you can do

3328.619 --> 3332.819
whatever the [ __ ] you want for a short

3330.42 --> 3336.9
time and then you go to hell like [ __ ]

3332.819 --> 3339.18
right you become absolutely exposed

3336.9 --> 3342.0
for the devil you are

3339.18 --> 3344.52
through your actions in that time

3342.0 --> 3347.46
well I think that this is kind of the

3344.52 --> 3350.7599999999998
same element but exactly the opposite

3347.46 --> 3352.14
where you basically have you can open up

3350.76 --> 3354.48
that can

3352.14 --> 3357.18
and act upon it and then you have a

3354.48 --> 3358.92
short time to basically

3357.18 --> 3362.819
manifest

3358.92 --> 3365.76
a a fortress through even through the

3362.819 --> 3369.359
brutality against the Beast

3365.76 --> 3371.78
but it's you have to be quick because as

3369.359 --> 3371.7799999999997
soon as

3372.079 --> 3377.6400000000003
it stops growing it stabilizes then the

3375.299 --> 3381.119
darkness immediately and crouches out on

3377.64 --> 3384.5989999999997
it and will attempt to utterly destroy

3381.119 --> 3387.7200000000003
and erase it because even anybody doing

3384.599 --> 3390.119
that successfully is an atrocity in the

3387.72 --> 3392.9399999999996
memory of the Beast and they will try to

3390.119 --> 3396.299
erase it so that people can never catch

3392.94 --> 3399.9
on to that that might actually work

3396.299 --> 3401.46
right but it's the opposite

3399.9 --> 3403.559
of like

3401.46 --> 3406.559
deal with the devil it's more like a

3403.559 --> 3410.119
deal with God but it does absolutely

3406.559 --> 3410.119
require sacrifice

3411.24 --> 3416.52
you will not after that point be able to

3414.059 --> 3419.8190000000004
just sink back in

3416.52 --> 3421.74
I mean you might be able to act like you

3419.819 --> 3424.38
are doing that but your internal

3421.74 --> 3427.14
workings will not be able to tolerate it

3424.38 --> 3430.2200000000003
you will literally tear yourself apart

3427.14 --> 3430.22
if you try

3432.42 --> 3440.42
so once you go for that it's yeah

3436.319 --> 3443.66
there's no way back it's just like do it

3440.42 --> 3443.66
or die

3444.78 --> 3450.48
see more on form compared to yes

3448.44 --> 3453.299
well logical conclusion the weird thing

3450.48 --> 3455.64
is yesterday I too basically had this

3453.299 --> 3457.92
rage in me

3455.64 --> 3460.3799999999997
a lot of the times actually even

3457.92 --> 3463.98
throughout the years when I do feel sick

3460.38 --> 3468.0
and like uh not very talkative it is

3463.98 --> 3470.059
actually rage that causes that

3468.0 --> 3473.64
but

3470.059 --> 3476.2200000000003
yeah why keep it inside is because I

3473.64 --> 3478.14
can't express it effect because I'm not

3476.22 --> 3480.1189999999997
strong enough I don't have the energy to

3478.14 --> 3484.3799999999997
actually create the transformation

3480.119 --> 3489.119
process to do this today I did have that

3484.38 --> 3491.819
and now all these crafts are gone

3489.119 --> 3493.44
because I was actually able to transform

3491.819 --> 3497.7799999999997
it now

3493.44 --> 3497.78
yesterday I was just I couldn't do it

3499.38 --> 3503.94
right I have to be

3501.42 --> 3507.839
willing to face

3503.94 --> 3511.559
the words that come out of my mouth

3507.839 --> 3515.16
because it is it yeah

3511.559 --> 3518.8190000000004
in a energy sense it is scary

3515.16 --> 3521.22
to basically express yourself like this

3518.819 --> 3522.48
and to come out for pretty hardcore

3521.22 --> 3525.72
opinions

3522.48 --> 3529.02
it is unnerving you see so you have to

3525.72 --> 3530.2799999999997
be strong and brave enable to be able to

3529.02 --> 3532.02
do that

3530.28 --> 3536.599
and if I'm not

3532.02 --> 3536.599
then I'll just kind of tire out

3537.299 --> 3545.4
but there's the issue this what a lot of

3541.02 --> 3548.16
people might think is crazy that's in me

3545.4 --> 3551.28
it's been in me pretty much my entire

3548.16 --> 3554.18
life first expressing itself like as a

3551.28 --> 3554.1800000000003
pre-teen kid

3555.599 --> 3559.619
and it almost never came out because the

3557.7 --> 3562.4399999999996
couple of times that it did I scared

3559.619 --> 3565.6800000000003
people so much that they would just

3562.44 --> 3569.76
never bother me again

3565.68 --> 3571.74
right it didn't work at school though

3569.76 --> 3573.5400000000004
because it's a different Dynamic it's a

3571.74 --> 3575.8799999999997
it's a group dynamic where you're in

3573.54 --> 3578.339
then so it doesn't work like that but on

3575.88 --> 3581.04
an individual basis

3578.339 --> 3584.64
it's like yay that seems like a nice kid

3581.04 --> 3587.579
a bit introvert let's push him around

3584.64 --> 3590.2799999999997
well guess what's gonna happen

3587.579 --> 3592.7400000000002
if I don't have any accountability like

3590.28 --> 3594.8390000000004
to the rest of the class

3592.74 --> 3597.299
like and there's just a random kid

3594.839 --> 3599.94
coming after me I'm [ __ ] him up

3597.299 --> 3601.5
and I'm gonna scare the [ __ ] out of them

3599.94 --> 3604.079
too

3601.5 --> 3607.02
right I'm gonna show them

3604.079 --> 3609.599
fear tactics that are adult level that's

3607.02 --> 3612.54
what I did as a pre-teen kid even

3609.599 --> 3615.38
scared the [ __ ] out of them right and

3612.54 --> 3615.38
really mean it

3616.319 --> 3621.42
because that's in me I have that power

3620.099 --> 3624.98
it is

3621.42 --> 3624.98
part of my spirit

3631.5 --> 3635.94
police screwed certain types of people

3633.72 --> 3638.3999999999996
yeah yeah I'd not make a good police

3635.94 --> 3639.9
officer because police officers have to

3638.4 --> 3642.599
be like

3639.9 --> 3644.28
spiritually armored like they can they

3642.599 --> 3646.7000000000003
must be able to handle pretty much

3644.28 --> 3646.7000000000003
everything

3646.859 --> 3653.359
right because they're gonna be facing a

3649.559 --> 3653.3590000000004
lot of people that are losing it

3653.64 --> 3660.839
or not a lot in some regions they will

3656.78 --> 3661.98
like thick city regions perhaps but in

3660.839 --> 3664.68
general

3661.98 --> 3667.02
discipline is the most important part so

3664.68 --> 3669.5989999999997
I'd never be like that

3667.02 --> 3672.799
nor would I be a soldier I'm more much

3669.599 --> 3672.799
more of just like a

3674.88 --> 3680.2400000000002
I could be like a war based motivational

3677.7 --> 3680.24
speaker

3681.48 --> 3686.7
I mean

3683.16 --> 3689.7599999999998
give me a flag one that I can support in

3686.7 --> 3693.5989999999997
a situation and I'll freaking row those

3689.76 --> 3696.42
soldiers up to to go get him oh yeah I

3693.599 --> 3699.1400000000003
can do that for sure

3696.42 --> 3699.14
you know

3708.66 --> 3717.44
but yeah when it comes to like actually

3711.839 --> 3717.44
being a executive of order

3718.98 --> 3724.339
through physical actions I don't think

3720.96 --> 3724.339
I'd be very good for that

3725.64 --> 3732.5389999999998
on the other hand I I could absolutely

3728.339 --> 3734.88
also be be a support in that like people

3732.539 --> 3737.7000000000003
that do do that they have frustrations

3734.88 --> 3740.039
they need to like figure out what's

3737.7 --> 3740.819
happened and the psychology I can help

3740.039 --> 3744.38
them

3740.819 --> 3747.48
right sure support right moral support

3744.38 --> 3749.4
psychological support

3747.48 --> 3753.44
battle cries

3749.4 --> 3753.44
that's the sort of thing that I can do

3757.14 --> 3762.14
I need to shave the sides of my Tash to

3759.839 --> 3762.14
do that

3762.24 --> 3768.4399999999996
nah

3763.619 --> 3768.44
it's that's so 19th century dude

3771.78 --> 3776.7000000000003
no I'm going for the the Chinese wizard

3775.02 --> 3779.099
mustache

3776.7 --> 3782.1189999999997
oh

3779.099 --> 3782.119
that's what I want

3786.97 --> 3793.2599999999998
[Music]

3789.059 --> 3797.3590000000004
Rhino police worldwide wear combat boots

3793.26 --> 3797.3590000000004
because they work better

3802.5 --> 3808.14
because yeah they you when you get

3806.22 --> 3809.5989999999997
stepped on your toes you don't break

3808.14 --> 3815.52
your toes

3809.599 --> 3818.099
and because they don't wear out quickly

3815.52 --> 3821.359
I don't know

3818.099 --> 3821.3590000000004
I like combat boots

3821.46 --> 3828.0
I really don't like sneakers I like

3824.579 --> 3830.88
really don't like them actually

3828.0 --> 3834.26
if women wear sneakers I find that

3830.88 --> 3834.26
extremely unattractive

3837.14 --> 3841.46
especially if it's freaking Nike

3841.619 --> 3844.46
ugh

3872.52 --> 3880.859
man I can't actually believe that I

3876.839 --> 3880.859
I said a couple this

3880.98 --> 3885.119
that was crazy

3882.72 --> 3887.9399999999996
before you know it you'll be erecting

3885.119 --> 3891.1800000000003
statues of Hitler just to have some kind

3887.94 --> 3894.059
of memory of what it is like to be

3891.18 --> 3896.339
strong and hard

3894.059 --> 3899.539
that that was like one of the craziest

3896.339 --> 3902.52
things I might have ever said

3899.539 --> 3903.96
oh but I think you guys got the point of

3902.52 --> 3907.339
it

3903.96 --> 3912.119
right because when things get bad enough

3907.339 --> 3914.52
you will look back somewhat favorably to

3912.119 --> 3916.7400000000002
the the [ __ ] up dictators in the past

3914.52 --> 3919.98
like even Stalin you know is like oh

3916.74 --> 3921.5989999999997
silent move right but dude in the face

3919.98 --> 3922.68
of all this

3921.599 --> 3925.079
like

3922.68 --> 3926.0389999999998
the more time passes the more style will

3925.079 --> 3928.6800000000003
be like

3926.039 --> 3930.3590000000004
hmm yeah

3928.68 --> 3934.14
might be

3930.359 --> 3936.96
maybe he wasn't that bad right

3934.14 --> 3938.5789999999997
I mean that is what's going to happen

3936.96 --> 3940.859
more and more

3938.579 --> 3942.539
right that's basically the I probably

3940.859 --> 3946.7599999999998
should have used Stalin as example

3942.539 --> 3946.76
Hitler is kind of like he was yeah

3948.119 --> 3953.059
it's no good he was too graveled

3953.76 --> 3957.619
maybe style is a better example

3968.039 --> 3970.099
um

3971.039 --> 3978.48
how long has he been president uh

3975.059 --> 3981.3590000000004
not all the time land Linux

3978.48 --> 3984.48
but he has a team yeah

3981.359 --> 3987.24
yeah that's not a dictator though

3984.48 --> 3991.319
is just as much a dictator as any

3987.24 --> 3994.3799999999997
political party right is it illegal

3991.319 --> 3997.2599999999998
for a political party to be in power for

3994.38 --> 3998.6400000000003
half a decade is that illegal

3997.26 --> 4000.619
no

3998.64 --> 4003.799
yeah

4000.619 --> 4006.2000000000003
so yeah you may call Putin addicted Yeah

4003.799 --> 4008.599
by that sense I can call this supposed

4006.2 --> 4011.72
[ __ ] up president over here in the net

4008.599 --> 4014.6600000000003
I can call him a dictator yeah I can

4011.72 --> 4017.72
damn well call him a dictator yeah

4014.66 --> 4021.3799999999997
I mean he has been in power very long

4017.72 --> 4022.52
even when he wasn't supposed to be

4021.38 --> 4025.579
right

4022.52 --> 4027.2
Putin is not literally precedent for

4025.579 --> 4030.02
decades on end

4027.2 --> 4031.46
he's part of a system of a group of

4030.02 --> 4034.64
people

4031.46 --> 4036.44
and they switch right that's legal

4034.64 --> 4038.48
that's not a dictator if you're going to

4036.44 --> 4041.079
call that a dictator then everything is

4038.48 --> 4041.079
a dictator

4045.98 --> 4052.16
if I was under Scott and true this show

4048.74 --> 4055.339
wouldn't be oh really dude how the [ __ ]

4052.16 --> 4058.52
do you know Bad Karma

4055.339 --> 4061.0389999999998
maybe Stalin would be my biggest fan

4058.52 --> 4063.7
maybe he would actually email me and ask

4061.039 --> 4063.7000000000003
me like hey

4063.799 --> 4067.7
as a favor

4065.48 --> 4068.72
just point at the group I will kill them

4067.7 --> 4071.839
for you

4068.72 --> 4074.1189999999997
right who the [ __ ] knows how do you know

4071.839 --> 4076.46
Stalin wouldn't allow people like me

4074.119 --> 4079.96
doing what I do

4076.46 --> 4079.96
how the [ __ ] do you know

4091.05 --> 4094.4790000000003
[Music]

4104.839 --> 4108.859

4107.48 --> 4111.139999999999
longer dude

4108.859 --> 4113.779
I don't care as far as I'm concerned

4111.14 --> 4116.56
Putin can literally be crowned King and

4113.779 --> 4116.56
I'd accept it

4121.699 --> 4128.0
like I don't care I don't care I don't

4125.12 --> 4130.58
care I don't care I don't care

4128.0 --> 4133.279
let him be king

4130.58 --> 4136.04
the thing is he's better he's better

4133.279 --> 4138.56

4169.64 --> 4173.900000000001

4171.679 --> 4177.259
thoughts as flatters

4173.9 --> 4180.44
well why is that toxic

4177.259 --> 4182.359
are we literally trying to fool people

4180.44 --> 4185.3589999999995

4189.02 --> 4193.279
you don't even know what the [ __ ] you're

4190.88 --> 4195.5

this conceptual

4255.14 --> 4262.9400000000005
seen unto me [ __ ]

4259.88 --> 4266.6
Stalin would shoot you through the head

4262.94 --> 4267.799999999999
because you're a lying deluded piece of

4266.6 --> 4269.6

when people do that

4298.04 --> 4303.76
anything political is pure evil like

4301.52 --> 4303.76

4405.739 --> 4411.08
karma is such a [ __ ]

get the bulletin really I would no no he

4414.56 --> 4419.06
wouldn't Stalin would immediately

4417.26 --> 4422.96
probably give me an alternative like

okay you can work for me or die

now bring on your space ideas

4426.02 --> 4428.860000000001

4431.179 --> 4435.04
and be happy to oblige

4437.42 --> 4443.8
yeah because I'm not just a stupid [ __ ]

4441.32 --> 4447.46

spreading the Flat Earth

4448.699 --> 4453.44
not saying that all like Flat Earth

4450.8 --> 4455.659000000001
activists are dicks

4453.44 --> 4458.96
but a lot of them are just as annoying

4455.659 --> 4460.28
as just churchians

4458.96 --> 4461.78
that don't know what the [ __ ] they're

4460.28 --> 4464.48
talking about

4461.78 --> 4466.46

spread but the Earth is flat they don't

4466.46 --> 4470.36
really understand the arguments not

4468.14 --> 4471.4400000000005
really it's just the surface stuff as

4470.36 --> 4473.98
usual

4471.44 --> 4473.98

scumbag that doesn't even do anything

5007.48 --> 5012.699
unless they get triggered yeah that's a

5011.44 --> 5017.739
piece of [ __ ]

5012.699 --> 5022.659

5017.739 --> 5026.32

5115.179 --> 5118.4400000000005

5119.139 --> 5124.54

5124.54 --> 5130.38

5154.42 --> 5160.4800000000005
it's it has you written all over it

5158.159 --> 5163.259999999999
it is something you would come up with

5160.48 --> 5163.259999999999
but it's beautiful

5180.71 --> 5183.819
[Music]

5185.199 --> 5187.799999999999
hmm

5195.1 --> 5200.46

5197.08 --> 5200.46
you think about the title is that good

5201.04 --> 5205.32
or is it over is it too much

5207.87 --> 5212.329
[Music]

5214.9 --> 5218.94
I bet it's gonna get a lot of clicks

5216.76 --> 5218.9400000000005
though

5219.639 --> 5224.26
there's a lot of people that I don't

5221.8 --> 5226.4400000000005
know Rachel and makes them squirt or

5224.26 --> 5226.4400000000005
something

5228.639 --> 5231.659000000001
I mean it's meant to

5232.9 --> 5239.82
it's not like I'm

5234.82 --> 5239.82
I'm just trying to hold back no

5252.4 --> 5256.9
you missed the rachman part well that's

5254.38 --> 5258.1
like the entire show Terence it's pretty

5256.9 --> 5260.62
much

5258.1 --> 5262.96
it's starting from like the first five

5260.62 --> 5265.5
minutes on

5262.96 --> 5265.5
uh

5273.88 --> 5278.04
I'm certainly gotta get a lot of

5275.98 --> 5282.29
comments today

5278.04 --> 5283.719
he should be locked up in a minute

5282.29 --> 5286.96
[Music]

5283.719 --> 5288.4
yeah it's just the person believes he

5286.96 --> 5291.12
lives on a globe

5288.4 --> 5291.12
of course

5296.679 --> 5300.78
kill win no no no

5304.42 --> 5307.62
no that wouldn't be funny

5308.139 --> 5314.28
and raid you in Against the Machine

5311.679 --> 5314.28
that's

5314.739 --> 5321.419999999999
actually not a bad title Linux I might

5318.639 --> 5321.42
save that one

5324.46 --> 5329.44
I'm gonna remember that that's that's

5326.8 --> 5331.6
really clever and it's something that I

5329.44 --> 5333.839999999999
would come up with too if you hadn't

5331.6 --> 5333.84
first

5340.12 --> 5345.099999999999
right I'll I'll save it for later

5343.179 --> 5349.5
I mean this is not the last time I'm

5345.1 --> 5349.5
gonna get pissed off on the internet

5351.1 --> 5354.52
um

5352.42 --> 5357.1
man the next time though I'm gonna get

5354.52 --> 5360.400000000001
some blueberries too

5357.1 --> 5361.179
these are really hitting the spot

5360.4 --> 5365.159
um

5361.179 --> 5365.159
look I'm almost entirely through it

5366.76 --> 5369.76
hmm

5372.04 --> 5377.26
yeah thank you guys

5374.5 --> 5380.34
I mean you guys are the best audience

5377.26 --> 5380.34
okay guys and girls

5384.94 --> 5387.94
dingleberries

5388.179 --> 5393.659
gobble up to all the Dingle Bears Here

5390.28 --> 5393.659
Comes Your Globe earth oh

5402.37 --> 5405.3
[Music]

5403.3 --> 5405.3
um

5417.34 --> 5421.02
munching down Globes

5427.3 --> 5430.96
although Globes are not as nutritious as

5429.639 --> 5433.38
this

5430.96 --> 5436.179
because these are actual

5433.38 --> 5438.719
empirically provable real things now

5436.179 --> 5438.719
aren't they

5439.9 --> 5445.48
club's just a concept you're not gonna

5441.94 --> 5447.54
get a lot of nutrition out of that

5445.48 --> 5447.54
um

5475.0 --> 5477.76
all right yeah yards yeah that's gonna

5476.86 --> 5480.58
happen

5477.76 --> 5481.84
dude it's the same over here

5480.58 --> 5484.239
like

5481.84 --> 5486.96
all my roommates are kind of in that

5484.239 --> 5486.959999999999
position too

5487.48 --> 5494.5599999999995
and I fear that they've all taken it

5491.98 --> 5496.419999999999
but they're not like constantly like oh

5494.56 --> 5500.580000000001
let's get the new one

5496.42 --> 5500.58
I certainly hope not anyway

5512.38 --> 5514.4400000000005
um

5541.9 --> 5544.799999999999
foreign

5557.739 --> 5560.5199999999995
wow

5567.36 --> 5573.82
yeah church that was not surprising

5570.04 --> 5577.6
they're all gonna die dude I called it

5573.82 --> 5580.42
and you may remind people about how I

5577.6 --> 5582.76
called it very early

5580.42 --> 5585.34
dare I say earlier even than Owen

5582.76 --> 5586.900000000001
Benjamin ooh like he's the ultimate

5585.34 --> 5588.400000000001
Arbiter of that but

5586.9 --> 5590.199
I know

5588.4 --> 5591.04
but I absolutely call they're all gonna

5590.199 --> 5593.138999999999
die

5591.04 --> 5595.659
and I wouldn't even like those oh no I'm

5593.139 --> 5599.6990000000005
gonna retract that oh it might have over

5595.659 --> 5599.699
exaggerated yeah no no no

5600.1 --> 5603.2390000000005
they're all gonna die

5606.82 --> 5611.199
now of course everybody's gonna die

5608.86 --> 5615.159
eventually but they will all die

5611.199 --> 5615.159
prematurely guaranteed

5615.639 --> 5621.159000000001
and yeah

5617.62 --> 5623.26
when I turn out to be right you can tell

5621.159 --> 5625.42
your children and your grandchildren

5623.26 --> 5627.84
that Arwin was absolutely right about

5625.42 --> 5627.84
that

5642.76 --> 5647.02
Placebo shouts right but then you can

5644.92 --> 5649.4800000000005
prove right

5647.02 --> 5652.1990000000005
I mean if not the standard substances

5649.48 --> 5652.199
are in there

5652.36 --> 5657.099999999999
the graphene oxide and just all that

5655.9 --> 5659.32
garbage

5657.1 --> 5661.3
yeah if you don't have any signs that

5659.32 --> 5663.159
you got the shot then you probably got a

5661.3 --> 5665.860000000001
placebo

5663.159 --> 5667.839999999999
and you're really freaking lucky

5665.86 --> 5670.839999999999
really lucky

5667.84 --> 5673.659000000001
all right but even if you got tests

5670.84 --> 5674.92
you're already taking poison

5673.659 --> 5677.92
really

5674.92 --> 5680.26
yeah remember those [ __ ] swabs you

5677.92 --> 5687.6990000000005
have to put almost like in your brain

5680.26 --> 5690.6990000000005
[ __ ] up yeah they have poison on them

5687.699 --> 5690.699
admittedly

5692.44 --> 5698.32
right so if you're gonna like take a

5695.26 --> 5699.46
test every week for a year

5698.32 --> 5701.38
dude

5699.46 --> 5703.78
you're gonna be pretty much in the same

5701.38 --> 5705.46
package

5703.78 --> 5708.58
because you're gonna have constant

5705.46 --> 5711.219
poisoning influences a really bad

5708.58 --> 5712.719
substance too like that stuff that they

5711.219 --> 5714.3
use for that

5712.719 --> 5717.78
terrible

5714.3 --> 5717.78
really toxic

5725.92 --> 5730.179
wow well done PGA C Net that's really

5728.86 --> 5733.179
impressive

5730.179 --> 5735.9400000000005
I've worn a couple of masks but it's

5733.179 --> 5738.219
because like the coffee shop where I get

5735.94 --> 5742.839999999999
my cannabis

5738.219 --> 5747.1
the guys kind of yeah is it is a Jew

5742.84 --> 5748.96
and like he just was like no you have to

5747.1 --> 5750.76
wear a mask pretty much no matter what I

5748.96 --> 5752.26
don't care if you have a card and it's

5750.76 --> 5753.639
like yeah I made you what are you gonna

5752.26 --> 5756.400000000001
do sue me

5753.639 --> 5758.619
that was his attitude kind of annoying

5756.4 --> 5761.5599999999995
but

5758.619 --> 5762.759999999999
now at least when I look him in the eyes

5761.56 --> 5765.46
right now

5762.76 --> 5767.860000000001
he knows I was right and he's

5765.46 --> 5769.9
embarrassed about it so I'm I'm kind of

5767.86 --> 5772.86
happy it's the only place I wore a mask

5769.9 --> 5777.239
I never wore a mask in the supermarket

5772.86 --> 5777.239
once not once

5780.04 --> 5785.86
only in that place because like he was

5783.28 --> 5788.38
just squirting over it

5785.86 --> 5790.9
and I really wanted to get that weed

5788.38 --> 5794.04
because he does have pretty high quality

5790.9 --> 5794.04
weed in that coffee shop

5795.04 --> 5799.54
know the guys I know like I know

5797.38 --> 5801.32
everybody that works there

5799.54 --> 5804.42
they all know me

5801.32 --> 5804.42
[Music]

5805.3 --> 5809.4400000000005
but anyway there's no more masks here

5807.219 --> 5812.139
I'm very glad of that now can actually

5809.44 --> 5816.759999999999
see what people look like again

5812.139 --> 5820.06
and there are so many especially

5816.76 --> 5822.280000000001
teens and post teens like in their 20s

5820.06 --> 5824.679
that have like facial problems because

5822.28 --> 5826.96
of the masks serious

5824.679 --> 5828.159
I'm really noticing it's like they have

5826.96 --> 5831.1
like

5828.159 --> 5833.0199999999995
skin issues exactly where the mask is

5831.1 --> 5835.2390000000005
not the other spots

5833.02 --> 5837.639
exactly where the mask is I'm seeing it

5835.239 --> 5840.4
all over the place

5837.639 --> 5842.26
although it is slightly receding now

5840.4 --> 5844.86
already since there is no more mask

5842.26 --> 5844.860000000001
mandate

5856.36 --> 5862.36
oh nice there at 306 okay well you were

5859.9 --> 5864.759999999999
kind of Lucky then because if you get

5862.36 --> 5866.86
the wrong security guard they might just

5864.76 --> 5868.96
like take you down and arrest you or

5866.86 --> 5872.04
something or try

5868.96 --> 5872.04
but good on you

5872.44 --> 5878.4
I was lucky enough to have very early on

5875.56 --> 5878.400000000001
thanks to my dad

5878.98 --> 5882.119
I had the medical card

5882.96 --> 5888.34
which I didn't work on the on the Jew

5885.639 --> 5892.4400000000005
guy in the coffee shop who owns it but

5888.34 --> 5892.4400000000005
it works on everything else though

5900.699 --> 5904.919999999999
hmm

5902.02 --> 5904.92
where is it

5906.639 --> 5910.9800000000005
oh I think I'm taking it out of the bag

5908.8 --> 5910.9800000000005
already

5911.26 --> 5915.34
all right there it is

5912.82 --> 5917.44
right this is because this is like

5915.34 --> 5919.42
official this is from the government

5917.44 --> 5921.82
this is downloaded from the government

5919.42 --> 5923.32
site with the link to the government

5921.82 --> 5925.42
site

5923.32 --> 5928.0
and yeah if you show this

5925.42 --> 5930.219
over here in the Netherlands they can't

5928.0 --> 5933.159
even ask you as soon as you show this

5930.219 --> 5935.139
they cannot inquire anything else and

5933.159 --> 5937.9
they have to let you in

5935.139 --> 5940.1990000000005
so I use that on a couple of like Mega

5937.9 --> 5940.199
stores

5940.3 --> 5944.320000000001
where they literally had people like in

5942.46 --> 5948.06
front of the store like oh you have to

5944.32 --> 5948.0599999999995
wear a mask like no no I don't

5948.4 --> 5952.42
right but you might not have been lucky

5950.08 --> 5955.0599999999995
enough to get access to such a thing I

5952.42 --> 5958.679
don't know if that is even in India if

5955.06 --> 5958.679
they have such options available

5965.98 --> 5968.58
hmm

5974.5 --> 5979.619
kicked a few Mass squares of my property

5993.46 --> 5999.1
oh that's hilarious at least G

5996.4 --> 6002.36
I think like a deaf person

5999.1 --> 6002.360000000001
well to be fair

6003.9 --> 6008.58
I sometimes have a bit trouble like it's

6006.3 --> 6011.46
I'm not deaf I have very good ears but I

6008.58 --> 6014.94
have very good ears for like music

6011.46 --> 6018.84
but if somebody doesn't like speak very

6014.94 --> 6020.339999999999
well pronounced then I cannot yeah

6018.84 --> 6022.4400000000005
there's times like when I have a little

6020.34 --> 6023.9400000000005
bit of focus trouble then I just like I

6022.44 --> 6025.58
can't make out what somebody's saying

6023.94 --> 6028.678999999999
even if they're just talking to my face

6025.58 --> 6031.199
and when I'm like that yeah masks are

6028.679 --> 6032.58
like make it a lot worse so I've had

6031.199 --> 6035.04
plenty of time for people who are

6032.58 --> 6037.199
wearing masks and it's like I can't hear

6035.04 --> 6039.239
you there's somebody else talking to me

6037.199 --> 6040.44
right next to me I can't hear you can

6039.239 --> 6043.619
you say it again

6040.44 --> 6047.159
still can't hear it can you say it again

6043.619 --> 6049.199
and that's been kind of annoying

6047.159 --> 6051.32
but they just wouldn't take their masks

6049.199 --> 6051.32
off

6055.5 --> 6058.82
yeah it's

6059.239 --> 6063.0199999999995
pointless what a world

6063.06 --> 6067.1990000000005
with masks it's like they can never come

6065.82 --> 6069.96
back guys

6067.199 --> 6071.46
like never

6069.96 --> 6073.7390000000005
the mask

6071.46 --> 6076.32
like like it's been unrolled for

6073.739 --> 6079.099999999999
supposed medical purpose they can never

6076.32 --> 6079.099999999999
come back

6079.38 --> 6083.78
yeah

6081.36 --> 6087.0599999999995
I mean

6083.78 --> 6090.0199999999995
bloodletting is medically more effective

6087.06 --> 6093.0
than wearing masks

6090.02 --> 6094.92
who knows maybe there is maybe even like

6093.0 --> 6096.48
there is something medical about it that

6094.92 --> 6098.159
I don't understand it's always seemed

6096.48 --> 6099.959999999999
like bloodletting is the one thing from

6098.159 --> 6101.219
the past that doesn't actually do any

6099.96 --> 6103.92
good

6101.219 --> 6106.08
unlike steak oil and all that and

6103.92 --> 6110.4
leeches

6106.08 --> 6113.4
but masks are just completely useless

6110.4 --> 6114.839999999999
for everything but one thing and that is

6113.4 --> 6118.5
slavery

6114.84 --> 6120.3
it's only one purpose slavery

6118.5 --> 6122.699
that's the only thing it's good for

6120.3 --> 6124.08
there is no medical purpose for it

6122.699 --> 6126.178999999999
whatsoever

6124.08 --> 6128.1
unless you're a surgeon working with

6126.179 --> 6131.04
open wounds

6128.1 --> 6135.6
that's it and then you gotta like take

6131.04 --> 6138.139
it off pretty quick after throw it away

6135.6 --> 6138.139
right

6138.179 --> 6143.9400000000005
that's about that's like the only

6140.159 --> 6146.638999999999
medical use for like a mask like that

6143.94 --> 6148.5
is Forest surgeon when they're working

6146.639 --> 6150.6
on an open wound that's it that's like

6148.5 --> 6154.639
the only place ever

6150.6 --> 6154.639
there's no other function for it

6163.739 --> 6168.54
and it's been figured out it's it's

6166.32 --> 6171.54
knowledge now right there's literal

6168.54 --> 6173.76
research teams that have worked on

6171.54 --> 6177.42
researching that and this is the

6173.76 --> 6181.6990000000005
conclusion it is completely useless

6177.42 --> 6184.7390000000005
medically there's absolutely zero use

6181.699 --> 6187.28
for wearing masks medically for the

6184.739 --> 6191.879999999999
general public for anything

6187.28 --> 6194.28
anything yeah so there is no logical

6191.88 --> 6196.32
reason why anybody should ever allow

6194.28 --> 6198.599999999999
something like that to happen ever again

6196.32 --> 6199.92
for any reason

6198.6 --> 6202.9800000000005
it is

6199.92 --> 6206.04
pretty much Revolt Worthy

6202.98 --> 6208.32
it is on the same level as oh yeah we're

6206.04 --> 6211.8
just gonna take your guns like oh you've

6208.32 --> 6215.099999999999
got to wear a mask and no no [ __ ] you

6211.8 --> 6217.92
[ __ ] you

6215.1 --> 6220.92
like choke on your [ __ ] masks there

6217.92 --> 6222.6
is no logical reason for anybody to ever

6220.92 --> 6226.639
do that again

6222.6 --> 6226.639
unless you're a surgeon in open surgery

6229.38 --> 6232.639
all right anyway

6234.179 --> 6237.179
insulation

6237.54 --> 6240.199
okay

6248.4 --> 6253.4
I don't know why you would but

6250.86 --> 6253.4
right

6261.719 --> 6269.36
anyway I'm gonna round out this show

6265.92 --> 6269.36
it's been pretty intense

6270.0 --> 6275.4
very ragy

6271.98 --> 6277.739
I still think that Sunday show and last

6275.4 --> 6280.739
Sunday was still a lot better it wasn't

6277.739 --> 6282.36
ragey but it was very focused and I love

6280.739 --> 6284.759999999999
it when I really

6282.36 --> 6287.46
get a grip on like these esoterics

6284.76 --> 6289.56
especially like religion and philosophy

6287.46 --> 6291.54
life after death how it works Spirit

6289.56 --> 6293.6990000000005
mechanic I love it when I get in the

6291.54 --> 6295.739
flow of that but it's just not something

6293.699 --> 6297.48
I can do daily

6295.739 --> 6299.879999999999
comes and goes

6297.48 --> 6302.099999999999
so I still like that episode better

6299.88 --> 6303.900000000001
if you haven't seen it really watch it I

6302.1 --> 6306.56
think it's probably the best show I've

6303.9 --> 6306.5599999999995
had this year

6307.98 --> 6312.48
but yeah this show today was probably

6310.679 --> 6314.82
very entertaining

6312.48 --> 6318.54
for some and

6314.82 --> 6320.639
hopefully heartfelt to others

6318.54 --> 6323.88
that are staring at the distance and

6320.639 --> 6323.88
like hmm

6324.119 --> 6328.259999999999
I don't really like that but he might

6326.52 --> 6330.2390000000005
have a point

6328.26 --> 6332.9400000000005
which worries me

6330.239 --> 6335.638999999999
I hope that's the effect that's what I'm

6332.94 --> 6339.119
trying to accomplish here

6335.639 --> 6340.86
not like oh Cookie Arwin no no no no I'm

6339.119 --> 6342.0
talking about things I was talking about

6340.86 --> 6344.099999999999
things

6342.0 --> 6346.32
that are very relevant

6344.1 --> 6348.719
and that are like

6346.32 --> 6351.119
they've been scrubbed out of the general

6348.719 --> 6353.4
Public's Minds through the conditioning

6351.119 --> 6355.799999999999
through the Communist conditioning

6353.4 --> 6357.0199999999995
and we need it back we need it back if

6355.8 --> 6361.679
we wanna

6357.02 --> 6363.780000000001
crawl out of this ever worse growing

6361.679 --> 6367.08
hell

6363.78 --> 6368.34
physical world help that we're finding

6367.08 --> 6370.5599999999995
ourselves in

6368.34 --> 6374.119000000001
we're going to need it back

6370.56 --> 6374.119000000001
so think about that carefully

6374.159 --> 6380.04
anyway thanks everyone for coming I hope

6377.28 --> 6383.34
you like this show if you didn't you're

6380.04 --> 6384.96
probably a squirty squirt boy and I

6383.34 --> 6386.82
don't really care because yeah down

6384.96 --> 6389.88
folks don't even show anymore these days
