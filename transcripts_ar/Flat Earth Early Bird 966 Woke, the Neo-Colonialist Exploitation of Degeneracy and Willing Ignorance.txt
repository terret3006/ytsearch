now i know i didn't know like

239.519 --> 243.20000000000002
how to place it how to pinpoint it in

241.68 --> 247.28
some kind of geography

243.2 --> 247.28
in order to figure out

248.4 --> 257.36
the the vowel sound so

254.879 --> 257.36
all right

262.88 --> 267.04
have i been doing well i've not been

gaming that game again

267.04 --> 271.199

268.72 --> 275.28000000000003
like no no

271.199 --> 275.28000000000003
five hours straight is enough for now

276.4 --> 283.84
north east scotland wow

284.88 --> 290.32
so are you at like the heavily

287.199 --> 290.32
mountainous area

290.4 --> 297.84
let me check

299.759 --> 302.08000000000004
hmm

304.96 --> 311.84
wait no the east is actually

308.479 --> 311.84
the less mountainous area

312.88 --> 316.0
it's the west that's

316.88 --> 322.96
all norwegian like mountain is right

320.72 --> 322.96000000000004
uh

326.24 --> 329.44
how classy of you

336.08 --> 340.56
right so you close to aberdeen

340.96 --> 347.68
like at the tippy top

344.72 --> 353.84000000000003
at thurso and wick this is what i'm

347.68 --> 353.84000000000003
bumping into on the map

358.479 --> 361.039
elgin

364.84 --> 381.84
frasenberg

366.8 --> 381.84000000000003
let me find that

388.8 --> 393.199
hmm is it a really small place because

391.36 --> 396.47900000000004
it

393.199 --> 396.479
doesn't really pop up

397.039 --> 409.84
first glance

412.88 --> 423.84
oh wow yes i did wow that is like

416.0 --> 423.84
literally the most

423.919 --> 428.0
yeah it's the the one of the most

426.0 --> 431.759
eastern

428.0 --> 431.759
four villages in scotland

431.919 --> 439.84
even more east than aberdeen okay

435.599 --> 451.84

470.96 --> 476.71999999999997
naturally fluent scottish because

473.36 --> 476.72
what what they do

476.8 --> 481.36
with with the language it's kind of

478.879 --> 481.36
alien

483.919 --> 494.79999999999995
to me hey good servant

492.72 --> 495.759
you need to learn some stuff about

494.8 --> 498.96000000000004
science or

495.759 --> 507.28000000000003
politics or psychology flat earth

498.96 --> 511.039
or jab uh okay

507.28 --> 511.039
oh i've talked about that a lot

518.56 --> 522.159
right anyway reverting back to

520.24 --> 523.039
yesterday's show i was very happy about

522.159 --> 527.36
it

523.039 --> 527.36
did get some really nice feedback as

532.839 --> 535.839
well

537.76 --> 549.8389999999999
hey that's your dusty writer

556.48 --> 561.2
yeah bully cat's good servant wasn't

558.32 --> 564.399
talking to you he was talking to me

561.2 --> 567.44
pretty sure that he doesn't go

564.399 --> 570.0
to your channel to learn about

567.44 --> 570.0
science

571.92 --> 591.8389999999999
hey style in 80 12. it's been a while

575.76 --> 591.8389999999999
good to see you again in chat

596.56 --> 619.8389999999999
really bolly cats do you good servant

604.399 --> 619.839
hey dean wright good to see you

652.56 --> 661.8389999999999
what he is okay

663.68 --> 669.3599999999999
okay well let me reassess you then

667.68 --> 669.68
because i kind of thought that you were

669.36 --> 675.2
like

669.68 --> 677.8389999999999
a conspiracy cat sock or something

675.2 --> 678.9590000000001
serious i just thought like oh you're

677.839 --> 680.72
just a

678.959 --> 683.68
conspiracy i didn't know you were

680.72 --> 686.839
actually a genuine

683.68 --> 688.079
person with the channel i'll check it

686.839 --> 692.72
out

688.079 --> 697.1999999999999
holy [ __ ] 32k subscribers

692.72 --> 697.2
damn i had no idea wait

698.0 --> 703.839
but you are conspiracy cats

710.24 --> 717.839
he has faith okay okay right so

713.92 --> 717.8389999999999
okay scratch all that

721.12 --> 725.839
you have more than one channel all right

728.839 --> 731.839
hello

738.8 --> 744.7199999999999
okay now i see it i i basically didn't

742.24 --> 747.92
read good servant's message in in the

744.72 --> 751.0400000000001
correct context now i see

747.92 --> 751.04
okay that's weird

752.62 --> 755.769
[Music]

756.839 --> 759.7600000000001
ah

758.0 --> 761.04
thought you were being apologetic to him

759.76 --> 764.079
but you were actually

761.04 --> 768.959
describing something more specific

764.079 --> 768.959
i didn't see it it's odd

770.839 --> 773.839
anyway

791.519 --> 802.639
hello agm

800.48 --> 803.519
yeah by the way all this stormy weather

802.639 --> 806.5600000000001
is having its

803.519 --> 806.5600000000001
influence on me

807.2 --> 811.0400000000001
so physically i feel a little wobbly but

809.6 --> 814.24
not like sick or anything

811.04 --> 818.7199999999999
it is just like

814.24 --> 818.72
yeah this weather change

819.04 --> 825.199
will be great if there could be just

822.8 --> 826.639
a bit more of that summer time with some

825.199 --> 829.8389999999999
good sun

826.639 --> 829.839
i do miss it

845.04 --> 848.3199999999999
what do i think the bible says about the

847.839 --> 853.7600000000001
earth

848.32 --> 853.7600000000001
shape well at no point does it signify

854.079 --> 862.079
that there is a geometric

857.44 --> 864.48
shape of any sorts right

862.079 --> 866.16
what i like the first and foremost thing

864.48 --> 868.88
i get from the bible

866.16 --> 870.24
the idea that there is a geometric shape

868.88 --> 874.48
assigned

870.24 --> 876.8
to the earth that part is completely out

874.48 --> 880.9590000000001
of the door there is no

876.8 --> 880.959
geometric shape assigned to the earth

881.76 --> 888.16
it is quite frequently though described

885.04 --> 891.76
as very flat and extremely

888.16 --> 894.959
far observations and all that all the

891.76 --> 898.48
typical indicators

894.959 --> 902.56
basically cross referencing what we

898.48 --> 907.519
could sort of experience in ways

902.56 --> 910.88
if we would come to the same

907.519 --> 912.48
viewing angles and unique spiritual

910.88 --> 915.92
scenarios that some of the

912.48 --> 915.9200000000001
bible characters go through

916.8 --> 920.24
right so it might be a little difficult

919.92 --> 923.519
to

920.24 --> 924.32
imagine that you could or would anybody

923.519 --> 926.9590000000001
would

924.32 --> 928.72
anymore go through such experience in

926.959 --> 931.8389999999999
order to see the earth like

928.72 --> 935.279
that but the way it is described

931.839 --> 938.8800000000001
is specific enough

935.279 --> 942.0
right so any geometric shape

938.88 --> 945.36
that the heliocentric religion

942.0 --> 948.399
assigns to the earth there

945.36 --> 948.8000000000001
there doesn't there's no sign of any of

948.399 --> 952.24
that

948.8 --> 957.199
in the bible not even

952.24 --> 959.36
like any kind of necessity to fill it in

957.199 --> 961.519
right there's just the aspects there's

959.36 --> 964.8000000000001
aspects described there's experience

961.519 --> 967.44
described but there's there is no

964.8 --> 968.3199999999999
need within it to even assign some kind

967.44 --> 973.12
of geom

968.32 --> 973.12
geometry to the place

977.839 --> 981.1990000000001
so the bible should never be used in

979.6 --> 984.0790000000001
effie

981.199 --> 984.56
well that depends on what you're going

984.079 --> 989.4399999999999
to

984.56 --> 989.4399999999999
try to attempt to communicate

990.639 --> 995.6
i mean it is extremely old book and

993.519 --> 999.6
these descriptions

995.6 --> 999.6
within them are very distinct

1000.959 --> 1005.5999999999999
right now if somebody says the earth is

1003.519 --> 1009.68
flat because the bible says

1005.6 --> 1012.8000000000001
so that's a bit of a stretch and that

1009.68 --> 1014.56
yeah that's not a very satisfactory

1012.8 --> 1017.7589999999999
argument in general but hey

1014.56 --> 1021.3599999999999
two people that have less grip on the

1017.759 --> 1023.44
the mechanical details of everything

1021.36 --> 1025.679
how physics work and all that yeah that

1023.44 --> 1027.839
may be sufficient grip for them

1025.679 --> 1031.52
personally

1027.839 --> 1033.36
to hold on to it because it's definitely

1031.52 --> 1034.8799999999999
not described as a globe within the

1033.36 --> 1039.6789999999999
bible

1034.88 --> 1042.7990000000002
right now there are corrupted

1039.679 --> 1045.679
priests of all sorts that like to

1042.799 --> 1047.12
say oh no but we still have to hold on

1045.679 --> 1049.8400000000001
to science

1047.12 --> 1052.0
it's a globe and the bible's talking

1049.84 --> 1055.6
about other things or they constantly

1052.0 --> 1055.6
try to make excuses for that

1055.919 --> 1061.6000000000001
but that's people inserting those

1059.12 --> 1061.6
stories

1061.84 --> 1065.6
inserting those connections when without

1064.64 --> 1069.3600000000001
injecting

1065.6 --> 1071.6789999999999
that opinion and those explanations

1069.36 --> 1072.8799999999999
people would never be able to come to

1071.679 --> 1075.1200000000001
those conclusions

1072.88 --> 1077.5200000000002
just reading the bible and that's how

1075.12 --> 1077.52
you know

1077.76 --> 1083.52
it's all priestly [ __ ] tagging along

1089.2 --> 1095.8400000000001
anyway hello dutch sailor

1108.799 --> 1115.12
what okay tom parker first

then i would but maybe i should do that

1275.28 --> 1281.71

1466.799 --> 1473.84
i really never did

1485.039 --> 1487.84
chapter two

1494.72 --> 1497.52
thingy eight

1498.84 --> 1501.84
what

1518.64 --> 1521.279
located

1526.84 --> 1530.8799999999999
nope

1528.08 --> 1531.6789999999999
that doesn't seem to be anything like

1530.88 --> 1543.8400000000001
what you guys

1531.679 --> 1543.8400000000001
and there's no pillars in there

1548.159 --> 1557.8400000000001
or is there like another part where

1550.159 --> 1557.8400000000001
there is another samuels or something

1558.48 --> 1571.84
no probably not

1610.84 --> 1627.84
hmm

1613.039 --> 1627.84
it starts off with the poor well

1664.48 --> 1669.84
are we reading the same bible as

1702.559 --> 1706.24
this is no this is just a waste of my

1705.919 --> 1710.88
time

1706.24 --> 1713.039
i'm sorry guys

1710.88 --> 1715.6000000000001
it's a waste of my time this is a waste

1713.039 --> 1719.679
of a freaking live show

1715.6 --> 1724.1589999999999
no this is why i don't

1719.679 --> 1739.8400000000001
typically like the bible because

1724.159 --> 1739.8400000000001
i can never find [ __ ] in it ever

1755.2 --> 1761.039
okay okay i guess thanks tom

1763.52 --> 1767.52
the throne of glory the pillars of the

1766.24 --> 1770.64
earth

1767.52 --> 1771.279
are the lords he hath set the world upon

1770.64 --> 1774.5590000000002
them

1771.279 --> 1774.559
well that doesn't really

1776.32 --> 1784.8799999999999
say a lot about it though except that

1780.64 --> 1788.3200000000002
something that suggests a foundation

1784.88 --> 1791.1200000000001
i mean has anybody ever seen the pillar

1788.32 --> 1792.48
the pillars i mean it's look from an

1791.12 --> 1797.1999999999998
architect's point of view

1792.48 --> 1797.2
yeah sure makes sense but

1798.559 --> 1802.8799999999999
i think practically it's about as

1800.48 --> 1805.039
elusive as the molten iron core

1802.88 --> 1806.8400000000001
although it's pretty certain that we'll

1805.039 --> 1809.76
never find that

1806.84 --> 1813.1999999999998
ever

1809.76 --> 1816.799
but yeah

1813.2 --> 1816.799
yeah the pillars of the earth is another

1820.84 --> 1823.84
mystery

1883.12 --> 1886.8799999999999
right yeah a baldy cats it's so funny

1886.24 --> 1890.96
you know

1886.88 --> 1892.24
as ballers ask but that means they all

1890.96 --> 1894.88
have to lie

1892.24 --> 1896.96
why is there a cover-up why is everybody

1894.88 --> 1900.7990000000002
in the cover-up

1896.96 --> 1903.279
well that's because

1900.799 --> 1904.1589999999999
of the nature of the mystery religion

1903.279 --> 1907.679
which it is

1904.159 --> 1910.24
and that is everybody that participates

1907.679 --> 1913.1200000000001
is engaged in the cover-up you know

1910.24 --> 1917.039
where the cover-up starts

1913.12 --> 1920.799
yourself you

1917.039 --> 1924.08
engage in the cover-up

1920.799 --> 1927.9189999999999
as you basically

1924.08 --> 1931.9189999999999
discard information that countermands

1927.919 --> 1934.96
your religious convictions so yes

1931.919 --> 1938.24
literally everybody

1934.96 --> 1949.8400000000001
is engaged in the cover-up that is

1938.24 --> 1949.84
technically correct

1998.96 --> 2003.279
how come it's possible they all work

2001.279 --> 2005.12
together for centuries to maintain the

2003.279 --> 2009.039
secret

2005.12 --> 2011.5189999999998
uh because you don't have to keep it a

2009.039 --> 2011.519
secret

2012.0 --> 2016.64
for the outside it's not like oh my god

2013.919 --> 2017.76
we cannot let the world catch on to that

2016.64 --> 2021.279
it's a lie

2017.76 --> 2025.44
no you simply

2021.279 --> 2025.44
decide it's the truth

2029.2 --> 2035.679
so the people back then knew

2032.559 --> 2037.76
it was lies it was wizardry it was just

2035.679 --> 2040.96
machination nonsense

2037.76 --> 2040.96
nobody believed it

2041.36 --> 2047.039
yeah so it was there is no secret

2044.399 --> 2048.159
to keep the only true secret that is

2047.039 --> 2052.96
kept

2048.159 --> 2055.52
is by the believer to themselves

2052.96 --> 2057.839
that's where the secrecy comes in not to

2055.52 --> 2060.159
the outside world everybody can see

2057.839 --> 2063.919
exactly what they're doing what you're

2060.159 --> 2067.04
doing what the ballers are doing

2063.919 --> 2067.679
when they engage in discussions and

2067.04 --> 2070.079
debates

2067.679 --> 2072.839
everybody can see that it's only the

2070.079 --> 2074.32
people that are

2072.839 --> 2077.359
along

2074.32 --> 2080.639
with the ride in that

2077.359 --> 2083.5989999999997
mystery religion that don't see

2080.639 --> 2085.599
it for what it is that's where the

2083.599 --> 2088.639
secret is kept

2085.599 --> 2091.679
to themselves and all those who

2088.639 --> 2094.8
participate in these actions

2091.679 --> 2097.359
will not see it because that is

2094.8 --> 2098.88
the mystery religion it's what you hide

2097.359 --> 2102.0789999999997
for yourself

2098.88 --> 2102.96
from yourself and everybody that

2102.079 --> 2108.0
participates

2102.96 --> 2110.2400000000002
will all join in

2108.0 --> 2113.359
and they will not see how it is

2110.24 --> 2115.5989999999997
blatantly wrong what they believe in

2113.359 --> 2116.7999999999997
and they will band together to defend it

2115.599 --> 2119.44
because they don't

2116.8 --> 2120.6400000000003
see it because they're all engaged in

2119.44 --> 2124.96
the action of

2120.64 --> 2126.7999999999997
not seeing it that's the religion

2124.96 --> 2129.44
that's why it's a mystery religion the

2126.8 --> 2130.88
religion is to keep a mystery to

2129.44 --> 2135.119
yourself

2130.88 --> 2135.119
to be willingly ignorant

2135.599 --> 2140.8
to let certain information not penetrate

2138.56 --> 2145.839
your consciousness in order for you to

2140.8 --> 2145.8390000000004
move on

2156.839 --> 2159.839
do

2166.24 --> 2172.3199999999997
no they don't want oh yes yes people are

2169.76 --> 2175.8390000000004
afraid of it

2172.32 --> 2178.2400000000002
they're afraid of the truth you know why

2175.839 --> 2180.4
because when you speak the truth you get

2178.24 --> 2183.2799999999997
attacked

2180.4 --> 2184.1600000000003
from all sides by the people who do not

2183.28 --> 2188.0
want

2184.16 --> 2190.8799999999997
others to hear the truth

2188.0 --> 2191.599
because they want everybody to take part

2190.88 --> 2194.56
into

2191.599 --> 2195.6800000000003
the mystery religion which requires

2194.56 --> 2199.119
people

2195.68 --> 2202.7999999999997
to get used to lies and not

2199.119 --> 2205.599
learn how to dig their way out

2202.8 --> 2206.5600000000004
by being confronted with truth and

2205.599 --> 2209.44
that's why

2206.56 --> 2210.24
entire countries don't come out as flat

2209.44 --> 2213.28
earth

2210.24 --> 2214.72
yeah that's why because of the

2213.28 --> 2229.8390000000004
retribution

2214.72 --> 2229.839
not because it's not true

2263.2 --> 2268.3199999999997
right but also

2266.24 --> 2270.0
go along to get along right but if you

2268.32 --> 2272.48
are taught your entire life

2270.0 --> 2274.88
that speaking the truth literally ends

2272.48 --> 2274.88
up in

2275.04 --> 2283.68
in punishment like unjustified like

2280.04 --> 2288.96
injustice based punishment

2283.68 --> 2288.96
punishment based on perceived feelings

2289.52 --> 2296.48
right not on logic or

2292.72 --> 2298.0789999999997
law well if you get confronted with that

2296.48 --> 2300.72
your entire life no matter

2298.079 --> 2302.7200000000003
where you go you get punished for

2300.72 --> 2304.24
speaking the truth well eventually most

2302.72 --> 2306.0789999999997
people will stop

2304.24 --> 2307.68
caring about the truth they don't want

2306.079 --> 2310.1600000000003
to hear about it anymore

2307.68 --> 2311.1189999999997
because every time they just get

2310.16 --> 2315.68
punished if they

2311.119 --> 2317.92
let it seed in themselves

2315.68 --> 2319.7599999999998
and that's how you get stuck and go

2317.92 --> 2321.6800000000003
along to get along it's like they stop

2319.76 --> 2323.8390000000004
caring because they're just sick of

2321.68 --> 2324.96
getting punished every time they attempt

2323.839 --> 2327.839
to

2324.96 --> 2327.839
speak the truth

2355.44 --> 2359.52
the why is a mind reading question no

2357.52 --> 2362.32
not necessarily thomas

2359.52 --> 2363.44
eight nine five five i mean there is of

2362.32 --> 2365.599
course the personal

2363.44 --> 2367.28
in the moment reason but there's also a

2365.599 --> 2370.56
design reason

2367.28 --> 2374.32
right they're part of a playbook obvious

2370.56 --> 2378.56
playbook that's even written down

2374.32 --> 2378.56
in other directions

2378.64 --> 2382.0
in politics like it is done like

2380.8 --> 2385.23
playbooks are out

2382.0 --> 2386.8
there and people that are in the

2385.23 --> 2389.28
[Music]

2386.8 --> 2391.28
on the front lines of this heliocentric

2389.28 --> 2392.5600000000004
mystery religion that tell us the

2391.28 --> 2395.52
stories that we

2392.56 --> 2397.119
look up to and memorize because we think

2395.52 --> 2400.64
there's an authority to it

2397.119 --> 2400.6400000000003
because it comes from these people

2400.88 --> 2405.2000000000003
they might have their own personal

2402.8 --> 2410.1600000000003
opinions about it about the lore

2405.2 --> 2413.04
about their actions about the people

2410.16 --> 2415.1189999999997
but that is insignificant in the face of

2413.04 --> 2417.2799999999997
the function

2415.119 --> 2418.8
that they perform and they do get

2417.28 --> 2422.8390000000004
provided for

2418.8 --> 2424.079
because these people are never poor ass

2422.839 --> 2427.119
people

2424.079 --> 2429.119
always have been paid for it

2427.119 --> 2432.0
and they continue to do that usually the

2429.119 --> 2432.0
rest of their life

2436.64 --> 2442.16
they get put in a playbook and the

2439.68 --> 2444.96
effect of that playbook

2442.16 --> 2445.839
is outside of their personal motivation

2444.96 --> 2447.92
it's just like

2445.839 --> 2449.44
somebody just has to do it it's like a

2447.92 --> 2451.04
corporate task

2449.44 --> 2453.92
like it doesn't matter what you think

2451.04 --> 2456.079
about it why you want to do it

2453.92 --> 2458.4
somebody has to do it and has to stick

2456.079 --> 2461.119
to certain parameters

2458.4 --> 2464.7200000000003
and that's why they get paid a lot

2461.119 --> 2467.119
throughout their life to do that

2464.72 --> 2468.3999999999996
it's like obviously neil degrasse tyson

2467.119 --> 2471.76
is one of these people

2468.4 --> 2474.4
and but yeah one of the more well-known

2471.76 --> 2478.7200000000003
ones but there are so many out there

2474.4 --> 2478.7200000000003
write a book oh goody yeah yeah

2478.839 --> 2483.92
no

2481.599 --> 2495.839
no i'll just talk about it in the moment

2483.92 --> 2495.839
i'll just explain it every single time

2497.44 --> 2509.839
you could write a book about it i'm not

2499.44 --> 2509.839
stopping you

2518.56 --> 2522.16
they cannot necessarily deserve well

2520.88 --> 2526.1600000000003
thomas eight nine

2522.16 --> 2529.359
five five look these spin doctors

2526.16 --> 2533.1189999999997
especially the ones in the past right

2529.359 --> 2533.119
like mid 20th century

2533.52 --> 2536.72
up to late 20th century when that was

2535.839 --> 2539.7599999999998
being done

2536.72 --> 2541.68
before the internet i bet that some of

2539.76 --> 2544.88
them

2541.68 --> 2547.44
got so deeply entrenched in the dream

2544.88 --> 2550.4
that they were handing out to the people

2547.44 --> 2551.04
that they would believe it themselves

2550.4 --> 2553.52
and that

2551.04 --> 2555.839
people at occasion might have to snap

2553.52 --> 2557.28
them out of the dream that they woven

2555.839 --> 2560.72
for everybody

2557.28 --> 2560.7200000000003
because they get stuck in it

2563.599 --> 2570.56
right nowadays that's almost impossible

2567.119 --> 2571.52
with the internet because there are just

2570.56 --> 2574.7999999999997
people

2571.52 --> 2576.24
that are going you it's not you can't

2574.8 --> 2579.2000000000003
stay asleep for too

2576.24 --> 2580.319
long and still be exposed to the outside

2579.2 --> 2584.3999999999996
world

2580.319 --> 2587.7599999999998
you will be confronted now in this age

2584.4 --> 2590.56
that wasn't around like that

2587.76 --> 2591.44
20th century not like that yeah there

2590.56 --> 2594.0789999999997
were some like

2591.44 --> 2594.7200000000003
conspiracy theorists individuals that

2594.079 --> 2597.599
might like

2594.72 --> 2600.9599999999996
pop up and suddenly ask very

2597.599 --> 2604.4
uncomfortable questions

2600.96 --> 2606.88
but there isn't there was never a

2604.4 --> 2607.44
a constant mob on the internet that

2606.88 --> 2610.319
would

2607.44 --> 2613.52
quickly figure out your lies and just

2610.319 --> 2613.52
hold it in front of you

2614.4 --> 2617.92
that didn't exist back then and because

2616.88 --> 2620.7200000000003
of that

2617.92 --> 2622.7200000000003
the dream weavers the spin doctors that

2620.72 --> 2624.72
would tell the heliocentric stories that

2622.72 --> 2626.3999999999996
everybody would end up looking up to and

2624.72 --> 2630.319
try to emulate

2626.4 --> 2632.48
they will probably they were probably

2630.319 --> 2634.4
getting stuck in their own dream

2632.48 --> 2637.68
actually believing that they were

2634.4 --> 2637.6800000000003
talking about reality

2638.72 --> 2645.359
and sometimes the the engineer

2642.0 --> 2648.96
part of the designers of every lucky

2645.359 --> 2650.4
jesuits or something mechanical people

2648.96 --> 2654.16
would have to remind them like

2650.4 --> 2656.64
uh that's very nice but don't forget

2654.16 --> 2658.64
we're actually creating machinations

2656.64 --> 2660.56
here it's not real and that could shock

2658.64 --> 2662.0
such an individual in the moment because

2660.56 --> 2666.0789999999997
they actually just got

2662.0 --> 2666.079
comfortable believing it for real

2666.96 --> 2671.28
in sort of a weird way i was stuck into

2670.56 --> 2675.599
this

2671.28 --> 2678.6400000000003
and purely by my own volition

2675.599 --> 2679.6800000000003
and that's where i derived my balwin

2678.64 --> 2682.56
character from

2679.68 --> 2684.3999999999996
because i was like that i would believe

2682.56 --> 2688.16
in heliocentrism

2684.4 --> 2689.359
even even got it as far the suspense of

2688.16 --> 2691.92
disbelief as

2689.359 --> 2692.48
knowing learning like we are building it

2691.92 --> 2695.6800000000003
we are

2692.48 --> 2698.079
building this story and then still

2695.68 --> 2699.04
as i would help construct the

2698.079 --> 2702.48
machinations

2699.04 --> 2703.68
believe it was real right i was very

2702.48 --> 2707.599
deep into it

2703.68 --> 2710.48
back then it's just that

2707.599 --> 2712.48
the results that my early attempts to

2710.48 --> 2714.0
like work together with people and like

2712.48 --> 2717.119
help enlighten them about the

2714.0 --> 2720.72
constructions of the globe machinations

2717.119 --> 2722.8
i figured out that it it's not a viable

2720.72 --> 2724.0
course for my life it's not a viable

2722.8 --> 2728.8
thing i could do

2724.0 --> 2728.8
it would corrupt me it wasn't

2729.68 --> 2737.04
the dream that guided me was idealist

2733.44 --> 2740.079
and unrealistic in the process of

2737.04 --> 2742.16
building it in the suspense of this

2740.079 --> 2745.28
disbelief and that was where i

2742.16 --> 2747.68
really got the big psionic

2745.28 --> 2749.3590000000004
backlash when i snapped out of that and

2747.68 --> 2752.64
that's when i felt like

2749.359 --> 2754.56
this society is so [ __ ] it's like even

2752.64 --> 2757.68
with the best of intentions

2754.56 --> 2761.68
even with the best of self manipulations

2757.68 --> 2764.8799999999997
you can't end up in a good place

2761.68 --> 2764.8799999999997
engaging with this

2772.4 --> 2780.88
from within their system actively

2776.4 --> 2783.28
upholding the lies because as i would

2780.88 --> 2785.28
keep myself in suspense of disbelief i

2783.28 --> 2790.2400000000002
would still be a striver

2785.28 --> 2793.6800000000003
for truth and good morale and all that

2790.24 --> 2794.0789999999997
while the system in itself neurotically

2793.68 --> 2796.56
made

2794.079 --> 2797.3590000000004
everybody tear that down and tear each

2796.56 --> 2800.7999999999997
other down

2797.359 --> 2803.2
in it to be to for

2800.8 --> 2804.6400000000003
move towards more subservience and

2803.2 --> 2806.96
helplessness

2804.64 --> 2808.0
in the face of the beast system that's

2806.96 --> 2810.2400000000002
where it would

2808.0 --> 2811.68
drive you towards and i couldn't handle

2810.24 --> 2814.9599999999996
that

2811.68 --> 2814.96
that was unacceptable

2815.04 --> 2818.56
i thought at a point that i could

2816.48 --> 2819.92
actually kind of like get in there and

2818.56 --> 2823.599
then basically

2819.92 --> 2826.48
transform everyone and everything even

2823.599 --> 2828.1600000000003
i had that much courage and belief in

2826.48 --> 2831.88
myself and in my strengths like

2828.16 --> 2835.7599999999998
yeah i get in there and actually just

2831.88 --> 2835.76
completely transform

2836.64 --> 2840.96
the liberal system but i didn't know

2839.44 --> 2844.559
what it was

2840.96 --> 2846.079
yet and when confronted by people about

2844.559 --> 2848.559
what it was

2846.079 --> 2850.079
i fell for the trick like they are just

2848.559 --> 2853.44
afraid of it

2850.079 --> 2856.8
they are making it up

2853.44 --> 2860.0
that it's this bad only too much

2856.8 --> 2862.559
later figure out by my own much more

2860.0 --> 2863.119
close range testing like yeah holy [ __ ]

2862.559 --> 2866.4
they were

2863.119 --> 2870.839
so right about everything i wish i

2866.4 --> 2873.839
i had been able to let this sink in

2870.839 --> 2873.839
earlier

2909.28 --> 2915.8390000000004
there's one piece of advice to the youth

2911.2 --> 2915.839
what would it be okay

2916.559 --> 2921.3590000000004
never blindly follow advice ever

2923.52 --> 2928.72
like you can listen to it you can listen

2926.24 --> 2931.5989999999997
to somebody's story

2928.72 --> 2933.7599999999998
but never just assimilate it with

2931.599 --> 2934.8
without realizing this is coming from

2933.76 --> 2938.2400000000002
people

2934.8 --> 2941.6800000000003
there might be tricks inserted in it

2938.24 --> 2943.839
that i'm not able to see yet you must

2941.68 --> 2945.359
realize that it's very likely that

2943.839 --> 2948.5589999999997
whatever you're going to be

2945.359 --> 2948.5589999999997
hearing reading

2949.119 --> 2956.319
seeing is going to have influences

2954.079 --> 2958.0
that are not good for you and thus you

2956.319 --> 2962.24
need

2958.0 --> 2965.68
to never accept things blindly

2962.24 --> 2965.68
that you hear from other people

2966.88 --> 2972.4
except i guess well that

2970.16 --> 2975.1189999999997
has some very mixed results of course in

2972.4 --> 2976.8
what type of family you grow up in

2975.119 --> 2978.2400000000002
except from your parents when you're

2976.8 --> 2980.2400000000002
very very little

2978.24 --> 2981.4399999999996
then you must and then your parents must

2980.24 --> 2984.5589999999997
do it right

2981.44 --> 2987.839
otherwise it will malform their psyche

2984.559 --> 2987.8390000000004
for the rest of their lives

2990.079 --> 2993.8390000000004
but as soon as you get like the teenage

2992.48 --> 2996.16
rebellion thing

2993.839 --> 2999.04
learn to critically think it's the first

2996.16 --> 3002.0789999999997
it's the only truly valuable skill

2999.04 --> 3003.44
that will help you throughout your

3002.079 --> 3006.079
personal evolution

3003.44 --> 3007.2000000000003
in your life it's the most valuable

3006.079 --> 3010.4
skill you can attain

3007.2 --> 3014.0
and it is the most sought after

3010.4 --> 3017.359
in order to destroy it and enslave you

3014.0 --> 3019.359
by the bee system critical thinking is

3017.359 --> 3021.92
the first thing they want to go

3019.359 --> 3022.7999999999997
and as soon as they part of the beast

3021.92 --> 3025.44
system

3022.8 --> 3026.8
that's going after you figures out that

3025.44 --> 3029.92
it doesn't work

3026.8 --> 3030.319
they'll step away they'll literally let

3029.92 --> 3041.839
go

3030.319 --> 3041.839
when they know they can't manipulate you

3053.839 --> 3060.24
a lot of people out there

3056.88 --> 3063.599
just see corrupting

3060.24 --> 3063.5989999999997
people's morality

3063.68 --> 3069.5989999999997
as a business action

3066.88 --> 3071.28
not to even like oh catch their souls no

3069.599 --> 3074.52
it's because of the

3071.28 --> 3078.079
bizarre practical

3074.52 --> 3081.52
exploitive mechanisms that have pretty

3078.079 --> 3085.28
much been discovered by

3081.52 --> 3089.68
centuries of grabler research on how to

3085.28 --> 3091.52
exploit corruption how to somehow make a

3089.68 --> 3096.48
profit of somebody

3091.52 --> 3099.52
going to [ __ ] in every conceivable way

3096.48 --> 3101.76
so a lot of people are getting corrupted

3099.52 --> 3104.8
out there thinking it's all personal

3101.76 --> 3107.599
when the people doing it sometimes

3104.8 --> 3108.319
care so little that it's nothing but a

3107.599 --> 3111.76
business

3108.319 --> 3117.04
investment to them to corrupt you yeah

3111.76 --> 3117.0400000000004
it's that impersonal it's that cold

3122.559 --> 3125.8390000000004
it's just business

3132.319 --> 3138.079
right and hey now i'm feeding back to

3134.8 --> 3140.8
the title of the show

3138.079 --> 3141.92
it is partly a neocolonialist

3140.8 --> 3146.6400000000003
colonialist

3141.92 --> 3151.839
strategy to exploit

3146.64 --> 3155.7599999999998
the degenerating willing ignorant

3151.839 --> 3159.599
it's just business colonialism

3155.76 --> 3159.599
was just business

3160.24 --> 3165.359
don't think about the morality don't

3162.8 --> 3167.44
think about the genocide the trauma you

3165.359 --> 3169.52
do know just think about how can we

3167.44 --> 3170.88
exploit this to gain more riches and

3169.52 --> 3174.64
control

3170.88 --> 3174.6400000000003
that's what colonialism really was

3174.72 --> 3185.839
and that's what it is now except now

3180.4 --> 3189.839
it's not as overt it goes through media

3185.839 --> 3189.839
through cultural programming

3189.92 --> 3196.64
and that's why it's neocolonialism

3193.52 --> 3209.839
and woke is the neocolonial

3196.64 --> 3209.839
disease that is festering

3211.76 --> 3214.88
ah i love how i i'll tie that in

3214.0 --> 3223.839
together

3214.88 --> 3223.839
in the end awesome

3242.88 --> 3248.7200000000003
they weren't blinkers not thinkers oh i

3245.76 --> 3265.8390000000004
like that one dean right that's

3248.72 --> 3265.839
that's very poetic

3290.839 --> 3293.839
back

3298.079 --> 3300.48
all right

3304.559 --> 3307.8390000000004
i'll be back in two minutes

3388.839 --> 3391.839
so

3402.839 --> 3405.839
dude

3406.799 --> 3419.839
the [ __ ]

3444.839 --> 3450.0789999999997
okay

3447.68 --> 3452.5589999999997
why would you bring that up dutch sailor

3450.079 --> 3452.559
serious

3456.48 --> 3460.72
like why would you go there like it

3459.68 --> 3463.2
doesn't matter

3460.72 --> 3464.48
whether it's cgi or whether it's no it

3463.2 --> 3466.72
doesn't matter if it's real of course

3464.48 --> 3466.72
but

3468.96 --> 3476.16
it's all messed up all of it

3474.319 --> 3478.88
the best thing we can do is literally

3476.16 --> 3478.8799999999997
erase it

3479.359 --> 3489.839
from our consciousness

3513.04 --> 3518.72
what the [ __ ] i write as i write this

3514.96 --> 3518.7200000000003
out what the hell kind of a comment is

3528.839 --> 3531.839
that

3548.559 --> 3553.2000000000003
they could easily fake space oh really

3551.28 --> 3559.8390000000004
matthew hall

3553.2 --> 3559.839
they could easily do that

3559.92 --> 3566.4
where is it then where's the non-stop

3562.88 --> 3566.4
cgi version

3567.92 --> 3573.92
of rising up from ground level

3571.68 --> 3575.52
and then going out of the atmosphere and

3573.92 --> 3578.079
seeing that planet in this

3575.52 --> 3579.28
where's the non-stop footage if it's so

3578.079 --> 3582.799
easy with all this

3579.28 --> 3586.1600000000003
crisp cgi then why isn't there

3582.799 --> 3588.4
any such footage why aren't like people

3586.16 --> 3590.3999999999996
in their basement in their own spare

3588.4 --> 3593.44
time doing that

3590.4 --> 3595.52
because it worked

3593.44 --> 3598.16
why aren't they doing that could it be

3595.52 --> 3601.119
because it doesn't work

3598.16 --> 3603.44
it doesn't matter how good the cgi is

3601.119 --> 3606.559
they can't truly make

3603.44 --> 3609.68
believable footage

3606.559 --> 3610.3190000000004
that fills the gaps because no matter

3609.68 --> 3615.44
how much

3610.319 --> 3618.96
you crisp clear make it look

3615.44 --> 3622.319
seamless it will

3618.96 --> 3622.319
just not be believed

3625.28 --> 3630.2400000000002
right it you can only believe it if you

3627.839 --> 3643.839
want to believe it and you don't

3630.24 --> 3643.839
you don't pay attention

3670.72 --> 3675.52
right matthew yeah well moon landing

3672.799 --> 3676.64
footage they watched a movie on the

3675.52 --> 3679.2
telly

3676.64 --> 3680.72
and they thought it was real and they

3679.2 --> 3685.839
don't want to relinquish that it

3680.72 --> 3685.839
might have been just a movie

3689.28 --> 3695.599
well great cgi

3693.28 --> 3699.8390000000004
wouldn't make it better or more

3695.599 --> 3699.839
convincing though

3700.64 --> 3706.16
like part of the convincingness of the

3703.119 --> 3709.52
magician trickery with the heliocentric

3706.16 --> 3711.68
cgi it

3709.52 --> 3714.88
also is psychological and has to do with

3711.68 --> 3718.0
the spirit of the times

3714.88 --> 3721.92
where are people's minds at will

3718.0 --> 3724.0
they be looking for some kind of escape

3721.92 --> 3727.28
from their dailies

3724.0 --> 3729.28
daily situations and then be like oh wow

3727.28 --> 3731.76
look at that

3729.28 --> 3732.559
and they get captivated more easily

3731.76 --> 3734.7990000000004
right

3732.559 --> 3735.76
a lot of it really has more to do with

3734.799 --> 3740.0
psychology

3735.76 --> 3744.1600000000003
and timing than it does with oh

3740.0 --> 3755.839
is it perfectly convincing when you like

3744.16 --> 3755.839
put it under the loop

3756.799 --> 3761.599
who filmed them leaving i heard that

3759.44 --> 3763.76
many times

3761.599 --> 3764.96
i heard many times ballers respond like

3763.76 --> 3768.7990000000004
oh it's just a

3764.96 --> 3770.0
automated camera that they left in some

3768.799 --> 3773.359
kind of a leave behind

3770.0 --> 3776.4
pod thing and it was live

3773.359 --> 3779.52
radio transmitting the stream towards

3776.4 --> 3781.52
the capsule where they recorded it

3779.52 --> 3784.16
and then took it back with them that's

3781.52 --> 3784.16
what they say

3785.28 --> 3788.48
now the more surprising part would be is

3787.52 --> 3791.68
that it is such

3788.48 --> 3794.48
seamless footage since radio

3791.68 --> 3794.48
transmission

3794.96 --> 3802.799
in like between two moving objects

3800.64 --> 3805.359
in that age would not have been all

3802.799 --> 3805.359
seamless

3808.839 --> 3811.839
right

3812.0 --> 3816.4
remote control is a thing yeah but

3813.839 --> 3820.0
remote video

3816.4 --> 3823.28
information streaming

3820.0 --> 3827.28
that's a little bit more of a bandwidth

3823.28 --> 3829.119
issue and at the time that technology

3827.28 --> 3832.88
wasn't all that developed

3829.119 --> 3835.44
yet so yeah a remote control

3832.88 --> 3838.079
that was easy to do you know why because

3835.44 --> 3842.559
it's like a basic transmitter

3838.079 --> 3846.6400000000003
that has like three signals or something

3842.559 --> 3850.0
and it yeah that's easy to get across it

3846.64 --> 3851.68
it's you don't have to purify the signal

3850.0 --> 3854.72
too much it's very easy

3851.68 --> 3857.839
information to relay yeah actual v

3854.72 --> 3859.9199999999996
full video streaming

3857.839 --> 3861.2799999999997
which we all take for granted nowadays

3859.92 --> 3865.039
because the technology has

3861.28 --> 3867.44
just perfected the transmission of this

3865.039 --> 3871.44
sort of information

3867.44 --> 3874.7200000000003
but that didn't exist in the 60s

3871.44 --> 3874.7200000000003
it was pretty tough

3876.4 --> 3881.039
like they could have done it but would

3878.079 --> 3882.7200000000003
have to have like really massive radio

3881.039 --> 3884.7990000000004
transmitters

3882.72 --> 3887.52
right well i'm pretty sure that the

3884.799 --> 3890.4
camera thing they left behind

3887.52 --> 3892.0
did not have a massive radio transmitter

3890.4 --> 3895.839
that they just left behind

3892.0 --> 3895.839
just to get that shot

3907.44 --> 3915.28
yeah so yeah remote control

3910.96 --> 3918.7200000000003
basic remote control yeah that's pretty

3915.28 --> 3921.92
doable in the 60s with the electronics

3918.72 --> 3922.799
level that they were at is pretty doable

3921.92 --> 3927.039
video

3922.799 --> 3927.0389999999998
information transmission though

3927.839 --> 3934.24
that wasn't that easy had a lot of

3931.359 --> 3935.92
like signal loss problems and like oh

3934.24 --> 3938.0
yeah because of the amount of

3935.92 --> 3941.52
information transmitted they needed more

3938.0 --> 3942.88
power etc etc but much more complicated

3941.52 --> 3947.92
to do back then it wasn't

3942.88 --> 3950.96
undoable it was doable it was possible

3947.92 --> 3954.319
but like with that moonlander thing

3950.96 --> 3957.2
and the camera they left behind

3954.319 --> 3957.92
i think that's way too small for the

3957.2 --> 3965.839
time

3957.92 --> 3965.839
that they couldn't they couldn't work

3984.96 --> 3988.7200000000003
didn't the president take a phone call

3986.559 --> 3988.7200000000003
from

3990.839 --> 3995.52
supposedly

3992.799 --> 3995.52
allegedly

3999.52 --> 4002.64
yeah that was so silly

4003.68 --> 4008.16
all right just imagine the amount of

4006.4 --> 4012.96
power

4008.16 --> 4012.96
required to bridge such a distance

4013.44 --> 4018.88
how much energy required to insert into

4017.359 --> 4021.839
a signal tower

4018.88 --> 4021.839
to do that

4025.039 --> 4029.3590000000004
like forget about the moonlander like

4027.2 --> 4033.1189999999997
they should have just like sent this

4029.359 --> 4036.24
giant billowing radio tower and then

4033.119 --> 4039.039
maybe it might have been possible

4036.24 --> 4040.319
right to actually have a live signal

4039.039 --> 4049.8390000000004
call

4040.319 --> 4049.839
at such a theoretical distance

4056.72 --> 4060.0
like why wouldn't they do that anyway

4059.68 --> 4062.96
like

4060.0 --> 4063.76
send a rocket with a giant radio tower

4062.96 --> 4068.2400000000002
like the rocket

4063.76 --> 4070.3190000000004
is basically a giant radio tower

4068.24 --> 4072.8799999999997
that is being rocket propelled and then

4070.319 --> 4075.52
just send it straight to the moon

4072.88 --> 4076.079
not even soft landing just make it

4075.52 --> 4079.68
literally

4076.079 --> 4082.2400000000002
just crash penetrate like a bullet so

4079.68 --> 4086.96
the tower is like firmly embedded just

4082.24 --> 4087.7599999999998
bang in there and you have a giant radio

4086.96 --> 4090.799
tower

4087.76 --> 4093.5200000000004
like why didn't they just do that

4090.799 --> 4093.92
oh yeah what because maybe people could

4093.52 --> 4096.48
then

4093.92 --> 4098.96
actually expect to have radio signals

4096.48 --> 4100.718999999999
being sent back from the moon

4098.96 --> 4102.4
so that's probably why they didn't do

4100.719 --> 4104.4800000000005
that even though theoretically that

4102.4 --> 4106.719
would have been a great idea

4104.48 --> 4107.5199999999995
if the earth was actually a globe and

4106.719 --> 4111.679
the moon was

4107.52 --> 4111.679
actually a physical body

4111.759 --> 4115.12
floating around the presupposed sphere

4114.159 --> 4117.3589999999995
earth

4115.12 --> 4119.839
yeah then it would have been a great

4117.359 --> 4119.839
idea

4121.35 --> 4124.4490000000005
[Music]

4128.45 --> 4131.95
[Music]

4172.839 --> 4175.839
so

4181.759 --> 4184.799
i'm hungry

4185.04 --> 4189.2789999999995
i may actually have an illuminati

4187.679 --> 4192.159
croissant

4189.279 --> 4192.719
i got one in the cooler i think i'm

4192.159 --> 4194.96
gonna

4192.719 --> 4196.56
heat it up and eat it still at the end

4194.96 --> 4201.12
of the live show

4196.56 --> 4201.120000000001
i think i gave out a good

4201.6 --> 4217.84
information to think about already today

4205.28 --> 4217.84
i'll be back

4298.84 --> 4301.84
um

4329.44 --> 4338.159
hmm okay agmo i think that that

4333.92 --> 4341.1990000000005
seed is not literal seed

4338.159 --> 4343.5199999999995
as in procreation seed

4341.199 --> 4346.0
i think that has more to do with like

4343.52 --> 4346.0
spirit

4347.76 --> 4352.08
spirit seed whatever anyway

4352.88 --> 4358.08
did you get the mail to her home address

4355.6 --> 4362.400000000001
no i haven't received any

4358.08 --> 4362.4
letter from you yet dutch sailor

4369.52 --> 4373.1990000000005
did you put did you put the money like

4372.8 --> 4377.12
in

4373.199 --> 4378.799999999999
a card you have to do that otherwise

4377.12 --> 4381.36
people can just see

4378.8 --> 4381.360000000001
its money

4383.28 --> 4389.28
okay right well then it just hasn't

4385.92 --> 4389.28
arrived yet i don't know why

4392.32 --> 4399.84
anyway thanks ahead of time i hope

4395.44 --> 4399.839999999999
it'll get here

4429.28 --> 4435.12
i heard a theory that satan was trying

4431.76 --> 4435.12
to corrupt the bloodlines

4436.56 --> 4441.84
well that makes sense yeah

4443.28 --> 4447.12
isn't satan always trying to do that

4445.84 --> 4450.719
isn't this spirit

4447.12 --> 4455.84
of obsession control and corruption

4450.719 --> 4455.84
always trying to do that

4457.199 --> 4460.879999999999
well whether it is about a specific

4459.92 --> 4463.1990000000005
messiah

4460.88 --> 4464.56
that is pro that arise through

4463.199 --> 4468.08
procreation

4464.56 --> 4471.1990000000005
or whether it be literally a spirit

4468.08 --> 4471.679
of the messiah and jesus christ coming

4471.199 --> 4475.04
back

4471.679 --> 4477.1990000000005
through us right whether you're talking

4475.04 --> 4480.719
about a literal birth

4477.199 --> 4483.839999999999
or a spiritual birth in many people

4480.719 --> 4497.84
yes satan is always trying to stop that

4483.84 --> 4497.84
that's correct

4498.64 --> 4503.52
all right well satan has corrupted the

4500.48 --> 4507.36
bloodlines well who's to say

4503.52 --> 4508.159000000001
that the bloodlines that there is even a

4507.36 --> 4511.599999999999
specific

4508.159 --> 4517.12
genetics that is relevant

4511.6 --> 4517.120000000001
to it how do you know for certain

4519.12 --> 4524.08
or maybe it simply has to be a surviving

4522.48 --> 4526.799999999999
lineage pretty much no matter

4524.08 --> 4528.719
what and who knows what'll happen then

4526.8 --> 4532.2390000000005
maybe at some point

4528.719 --> 4534.8
one will be born in there or in multiple

4532.239 --> 4537.759999999999
bloodlines

4534.8 --> 4539.84
that will suddenly just be like

4537.76 --> 4543.04
completely purified

4539.84 --> 4546.400000000001
from everything and they'll

4543.04 --> 4549.76
literally just like totally

4546.4 --> 4551.839999999999
reject everything that's been built up

4549.76 --> 4553.52
by these bloodlines up until that point

4551.84 --> 4556.400000000001
all the corruption

4553.52 --> 4558.320000000001
and and literally just transform [ __ ]

4556.4 --> 4559.92
who knows that might happen i'm not

4558.32 --> 4562.799999999999
saying it is happening

4559.92 --> 4562.8
or will happen

4563.44 --> 4570.879999999999
but i do not see it as something that

4567.6 --> 4573.04
the design could not bring forth

4570.88 --> 4576.08
i think that's definitely a possibility

4573.04 --> 4576.08
that it could happen

4577.6 --> 4581.84
our internet was lagging i didn't see

4579.44 --> 4581.839999999999
that

4615.6 --> 4620.08
so let me charge the bat that's sure

4620.239 --> 4627.12
but there's no like electric

4623.28 --> 4629.759999999999
socket down here at the base of the

4627.12 --> 4629.76
building though

4631.84 --> 4636.8
although there is like a car charging

4635.12 --> 4638.88
station

4636.8 --> 4640.320000000001
at the building but i don't know if that

4638.88 --> 4651.84
works on your electric

4640.32 --> 4651.84
fear on your electric bike though

4676.84 --> 4679.84
hmm

4690.84 --> 4693.84
do

4708.56 --> 4711.92
what voltage and frequency is the

4711.199 --> 4716.159
electricity

4711.92 --> 4716.159
uh again

4718.48 --> 4721.839999999999
[ __ ] i forgot

4725.28 --> 4735.84
i'm not an electrician i forgot i didn't

4728.64 --> 4735.84
know that

4736.0 --> 4749.84
i think it's a different system from the

4738.0 --> 4749.84
united states

4760.84 --> 4763.84
right

4769.44 --> 4777.839999999999
50 hertz is it

4785.12 --> 4793.36
let's see if this works oh goody

4788.719 --> 4793.36
no i don't want to buy [ __ ]

4802.84 --> 4805.84
uh

4806.88 --> 4812.0
this is okay i'm gonna have to trust you

4811.199 --> 4814.96
guys because

4812.0 --> 4815.44
google is only giving me oh you could

4814.96 --> 4817.36
buy

4815.44 --> 4818.799999999999
electric i don't want to freaking buy it

4817.36 --> 4833.839999999999
i just want to know

4818.8 --> 4833.84
what it is this doesn't seem to work

4864.48 --> 4867.599999999999
right okay now yeah i had to say

4866.96 --> 4871.679
electric

4867.6 --> 4873.76
socket and actually say voltage

4871.679 --> 4875.4400000000005
and then now i'm actually getting a

4873.76 --> 4878.56
readout so yeah it says

4875.44 --> 4882.159
120 volts in north america

4878.56 --> 4887.6
and 220 240

4882.159 --> 4891.44
in europe that's extremely low voltage

4887.6 --> 4903.84
why the higher the voltage

4891.44 --> 4903.839999999999
the less of a loss over distance

4913.199 --> 4919.839999999999
now steamy traveler was referring to the

4916.719 --> 4919.84
the united states

4920.0 --> 4931.84
george sanford

4938.679 --> 4943.92
240 volts no i'm talking about 120 i'm

4942.56 --> 4947.04
talking about

4943.92 --> 4950.4800000000005
north america

4947.04 --> 4954.239
electrics says 120

4950.48 --> 4958.08
volts i find that very low

4954.239 --> 4972.32
compared to european 20 to

4958.08 --> 4987.84
40 volts

4972.32 --> 4987.84
all right

5019.679 --> 5033.36
oh it's still hot hot hot

5029.76 --> 5043.84
ah damn

5033.36 --> 5043.839999999999
yeah still very hot

5082.84 --> 5086.719
okay georgia are you saying that they

5086.08 --> 5090.08
just

5086.719 --> 5091.679
transform it at the light socket so they

5090.08 --> 5095.04
put transformers in

5091.679 --> 5096.0
everywhere instead of leaving the

5095.04 --> 5100.159
transformers

5096.0 --> 5100.159
at the machines

5100.4 --> 5104.96
that actually tap into the electricity

5110.88 --> 5116.4800000000005
oh adam oh he just

5114.0 --> 5119.04
upgraded my title oh that looks title

5116.48 --> 5119.04
card looks

5121.33 --> 5124.43
[Applause]

5124.84 --> 5127.84
amazing

5139.12 --> 5155.84
i'm definitely going to use that

5163.12 --> 5166.08
so this works

5166.48 --> 5169.759999999999
i find a little confusing to change

5168.48 --> 5171.678999999999
title cards

5169.76 --> 5173.12
while i'm still streaming let's see if

5171.679 --> 5183.84
ah yeah yeah

5173.12 --> 5183.84
here i go

5194.84 --> 5197.84
kaboom

5199.679 --> 5201.92
uh

5203.84 --> 5211.4400000000005
okay did that work

5208.0 --> 5215.6
i think page

5211.44 --> 5215.599999999999
crashed for some reason yeah it did work

5222.84 --> 5227.6
awesome

5225.199 --> 5229.599999999999
yeah i took the the lighter colored

5227.6 --> 5230.96
version because with the black letters

5229.6 --> 5235.679
you just couldn't read it at

5230.96 --> 5235.679
all adam good stuff thanks for doing

5236.84 --> 5239.84
that

5250.84 --> 5253.84
um

5273.679 --> 5277.28
okay well this is so very informative

5276.48 --> 5280.799999999999
about the whole

5277.28 --> 5285.679
voltage situation in electric sockets

5280.8 --> 5285.679
however i'm not an electro engineer

5286.96 --> 5292.159
so i don't think i'll ever really

5290.0 --> 5294.239
be able to give you some kind of real

5292.159 --> 5297.04
practical advice on that

5294.239 --> 5300.718999999999
like i i mean if i'd have like a house i

5297.04 --> 5303.92
was responsible for it yeah sure i would

5300.719 --> 5306.2390000000005
make sure i my electric situation would

5303.92 --> 5308.56
be good enough i do like pay attention

5306.239 --> 5310.799999999999
to it

5308.56 --> 5310.8
but

5313.28 --> 5320.32
yeah i'm not a particular fan of high

5316.96 --> 5320.32
voltage electricity

5320.88 --> 5325.6
i have been like shocked because of that

5323.28 --> 5325.599999999999
[ __ ]

5328.0 --> 5331.36
short circuit equipment and all that i

5330.719 --> 5336.2
really

5331.36 --> 5339.339999999999
really don't like it

5336.2 --> 5339.34
[Music]

5348.84 --> 5351.84
what

5352.159 --> 5365.839999999999

oh goody iron 26

5418.84 --> 5423.1990000000005
hmm

5421.52 --> 5426.8
oh by the way clutch now that you're

5423.199 --> 5435.839999999999
here did you check out

5426.8 --> 5435.84
my panda conspiracy entry

5461.679 --> 5465.76
i gave you a tip the other day about it

5469.12 --> 5472.96
not the vault it's the emperor in paris

5471.52 --> 5476.4800000000005
yeah yeah

5472.96 --> 5478.96
well that's why in general i

5476.48 --> 5482.718999999999
i kind of early on learned that it like

5478.96 --> 5482.719
higher voltage is just better

5485.6 --> 5491.84
higher voltage less amperes

5494.8 --> 5501.360000000001
i forgot it again

5498.32 --> 5505.84
you literally asked in chat and i

5501.36 --> 5505.839999999999
gave you the answer at the time

5506.32 --> 5510.08
right it's it's the show with the really

5509.04 --> 5515.04
atrocious

5510.08 --> 5518.719
picture warning do not overcook

5515.04 --> 5522.56
episode 959

5518.719 --> 5522.56
i'll link you up in chat

5524.88 --> 5531.04
there's a link in the comment section

5528.56 --> 5532.0
that's not there's a link in the comment

5531.04 --> 5535.36
section

5532.0 --> 5539.84
of that show that specifically

5535.36 --> 5543.679
times when i start talking about it

5539.84 --> 5543.679
so you don't have to watch the entire

5544.84 --> 5547.84
thing

5551.679 --> 5555.12
or actually i could literally just

5553.52 --> 5561.84
directly link you

5555.12 --> 5561.84
to that that would be even better

5572.0 --> 5579.76
there you go that's the one

5577.199 --> 5579.759999999999
this one

5585.6 --> 5589.1990000000005
i haven't seen anything in about a week

5587.12 --> 5591.5199999999995
oh right that that

5589.199 --> 5592.4
would make sense yeah if you yeah you

5591.52 --> 5594.4800000000005
already said

5592.4 --> 5595.92
you didn't have any internet so yeah i

5594.48 --> 5598.32
shouldn't be expecting you to have

5595.92 --> 5603.84
watched that

5598.32 --> 5603.84
all right

5627.76 --> 5631.84

100

5653.28 --> 5661.36
sure though but x320 was hanging in chat

5658.56 --> 5664.320000000001
over at the flat earth debate yesterday

5661.36 --> 5667.759999999999
and he basically said he's a baller

5664.32 --> 5667.759999999999
i didn't even realize that

5670.639 --> 5674.639
he's been not very overt about it in my

5673.12 --> 5687.84
chat but apparently he

5674.639 --> 5687.84
is a baller weird

5715.6 --> 5718.719
yeah i know you're a baller daffy duck

5717.92 --> 5729.84
you've made that

5718.719 --> 5729.84
blatantly obvious

5746.88 --> 5757.84
chew a little louder sorry

5769.76 --> 5771.84
you

5777.73 --> 5780.839999999999
[Music]

5792.88 --> 5799.84
sound bites right

5823.119 --> 5826.96
if you want real sound bites of me

5825.04 --> 5829.76
eating then

5826.96 --> 5832.159
go to the first hundred early bird shows

5829.76 --> 5834.56

5834.56 --> 5839.1990000000005
single show

5837.119 --> 5840.159
and yes i had a lot of complaints about

5839.199 --> 5843.28
it

5840.159 --> 5855.839999999999
and i didn't give a [ __ ] because i had

5843.28 --> 5855.84
to fill the show somehow

5880.639 --> 5885.119
okay well it seems like we got a couple

5883.04 --> 5887.44
of electricians in chat

5885.119 --> 5889.679
i'll just let you chat away there's very

5887.44 --> 5892.799999999999
little i can add to that so

5889.679 --> 5894.159
i'm fine with it by the way but i am

5892.8 --> 5899.119000000001
feeling a bit like a

5894.159 --> 5899.119
fifth wheel in my own show now but all

5908.84 --> 5911.84
right

5922.84 --> 5925.84
so

5983.679 --> 5986.0
right

5991.52 --> 5996.96
nothing wrong with pretending to be a

5993.76 --> 5996.96
marine biologist

6006.84 --> 6009.84

6034.84 --> 6037.84
