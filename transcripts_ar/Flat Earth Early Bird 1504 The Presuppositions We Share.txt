and it's beautiful weather so it's kind

122.46 --> 126.439
of nice nice little surprise

129.119 --> 136.319
Richard birds are chirping out there and

133.56 --> 138.9
flying around

136.319 --> 142.73899999999998
and it's just beautiful sunny

138.9 --> 145.08
no wind almost no wind that's like a

142.739 --> 149.18
real bonus

145.08 --> 149.18
so it's really nice outside actually

152.4 --> 156.56
this this delightful fresh air

156.66 --> 159.07999999999998
great

163.56 --> 168.18
yeah

164.959 --> 170.16
hello logical observations first in chat

168.18 --> 174.72
good to see you

170.16 --> 177.2
happy birthday you remember to thank you

174.72 --> 177.2
right

182.459 --> 188.78
yeah I feel pretty good

185.459 --> 188.78
went to bed in time

190.739 --> 196.14000000000001
yeah

193.14 --> 200.599
overall nice day yesterday

196.14 --> 200.599
low Awakening Soul deer

201.18 --> 203.959
good morning

208.44 --> 211.44
ah

212.58 --> 219.06
it is Monday the 6th of February 2023

220.379 --> 225.84
let's check the temperature

222.9 --> 227.81900000000002
probably around 10.

225.84 --> 229.98
oh wait eight degrees

227.819 --> 231.78
okay

229.98 --> 235.44
wow

231.78 --> 237.659
it says it's raining

235.44 --> 239.819
but it's not

237.659 --> 241.62
at all

239.819 --> 245.0
let me take a look outside if you see

241.62 --> 245.0
any big clouds in the distance

258.26 --> 262.139
nope

259.979 --> 265.38
wow

262.139 --> 268.199
that is complete [ __ ]

265.38 --> 270.54
I mean there's no big clouds anywhere in

268.199 --> 274.86
all directions

270.54 --> 277.02000000000004
so that makes absolutely no sense

274.86 --> 279.36
it's a good thing that I keep track of

277.02 --> 281.94
my own weather report

279.36 --> 284.12
based on what is actually visibly out

281.94 --> 284.12
there

289.8 --> 296.419
because this is like the current reading

293.34 --> 296.419
makes no sense

298.199 --> 302.479
anyway that got all dark again

304.919 --> 310.21999999999997
does happen a bit with the daylight in

307.8 --> 310.22
the background

310.68 --> 315.32
not you not see hello

321.479 --> 326.84
huh

323.16 --> 326.84000000000003
open the new people in here

331.5 --> 336.419
how are you doing

332.88 --> 338.88
how did where'd you come from

336.419 --> 342.68
let me guess you came from Dahan because

338.88 --> 342.68
I like to hang around in that chat

348.3 --> 351.38
or somewhere else

354.84 --> 358.85999999999996
because I know logical observations I

356.759 --> 362.16
know is from

358.86 --> 363.6
seen him around like on FTD chats too so

362.16 --> 366.91900000000004
but

363.6 --> 366.91900000000004
you too I don't know

371.039 --> 374.3
I feed yesterday

382.259 --> 386.78000000000003
well

383.819 --> 386.78000000000003
was it though

389.88 --> 394.38
I don't think so

391.56 --> 397.34
now there was a lot of trolls over at

394.38 --> 397.34
flat swords though

404.4 --> 408.12
it was like a whole bunch of hassle in

406.259 --> 412.1
there and I was part of that

408.12 --> 412.1
basically chat rioting

412.74 --> 417.78000000000003
just this whining person just he had a

415.919 --> 420.5
membership but he just wouldn't stop

417.78 --> 420.5
complaining

421.979 --> 426.9
just winding winding whining

424.62 --> 428.34000000000003
and people kept timing him out but every

426.9 --> 430.56
time he would come back with another

428.34 --> 434.34
complaint like for like half an hour

430.56 --> 436.259
straight that guy's not entirely

434.34 --> 439.25899999999996
normal in the head

436.259 --> 440.88
to do that is absolutely

439.259 --> 442.259
ridiculous

440.88 --> 446.12
anyway

442.259 --> 446.12
hey flutter Sage good to see you

446.24 --> 449.94
[Music]

447.36 --> 451.26
it's not in the chat too okay

449.94 --> 454.56
right

451.26 --> 457.8
[Music]

454.56 --> 460.34
thanks for telling me now I know

457.8 --> 460.34000000000003
foreign

461.46 --> 465.68
yeah good show yesterday yeah I thought

463.44 --> 465.68
so

466.02 --> 470.58
but I think that all my shows have been

467.94 --> 472.94
getting better since since I stopped

470.58 --> 472.94
drinking

474.36 --> 481.5
and it's weird because it's like I get

478.8 --> 484.56
more things I pick up on them but what

481.5 --> 487.08
I'm doing that I'm getting critical of

484.56 --> 489.06
but if I actually watch back no I am

487.08 --> 491.28
doing better

489.06 --> 493.74
it's weird like I feel like I'm doing

491.28 --> 495.599
worse but I'm actually doing better like

493.74 --> 498.259
that's kind of what this is

495.599 --> 498.259
it's weird

499.319 --> 506.52000000000004
but anyway I'm still in the middle of re

501.8 --> 509.78000000000003
adjusting attuning to what this is like

506.52 --> 509.78
anyway right

518.94 --> 521.9590000000001
let's see

526.44 --> 530.7
um

527.519 --> 533.48
yeah besides flat so it wasn't a lot of

530.7 --> 533.48
stuff happening

543.0 --> 546.0
uh

552.48 --> 557.7
well yeah that was like that's just

555.44 --> 559.5
everybody's whining about freaking

557.7 --> 561.9590000000001
balloons man

559.5 --> 568.64
ah

561.959 --> 568.64
so balloons is the talk of the weak like

568.92 --> 572.3
just stop it

577.339 --> 585.3800000000001
Biden shut down the balloon or something

581.279 --> 585.38
it like who cares

597.66 --> 602.06
right flutter said yeah yeah good and

599.88 --> 602.06
you

612.72 --> 618.5
well the thing is I do have to say I did

615.06 --> 618.5
really enjoy a lot of it

619.92 --> 625.0799999999999
but at some point like yeah it just

622.62 --> 627.3
didn't work anymore and so

625.08 --> 628.9200000000001
like I'm not dumb enough to just try and

627.3 --> 632.5999999999999
hold on to something that I'm not even

628.92 --> 632.5999999999999
getting anymore out of it right

639.36 --> 642.62
hello George Sanford

661.16 --> 666.8
oh [ __ ] that's your girlfriend because

663.959 --> 666.8
of that damn

669.06 --> 676.92
well thankfully I haven't lost any real

672.899 --> 679.8
like love interests because of alcohol

676.92 --> 681.959
dude because when I'm with like a girl I

679.8 --> 686.459
don't want a drink

681.959 --> 689.0999999999999
I'm freaking high on the girl

686.459 --> 691.3199999999999
I'm not even joking like I don't want

689.1 --> 694.8000000000001
drinks

691.32 --> 698.1
I mean maybe if I don't know them yet

694.8 --> 701.3389999999999
just to call my nerves

698.1 --> 703.5
like if I'm like at a party or something

701.339 --> 706.0400000000001
yeah it makes it a lot easier to let it

703.5 --> 709.079
just impulsively just go for it right

706.04 --> 709.86
but once I know them I don't want to

709.079 --> 710.77
drink

709.86 --> 713.7
no way

710.77 --> 717.56
[Music]

713.7 --> 717.5600000000001
I want all my senses available

718.68 --> 721.76
right I mean

723.48 --> 727.9200000000001
I have like had experiences where I like

725.94 --> 730.44
smoked a joint like my girlfriend like

727.92 --> 733.62
because I had before I had girlfriends

730.44 --> 737.399
before my ex yeah okay

733.62 --> 741.079
and my first girlfriend was a cannabis

737.399 --> 741.079
smoker second one

741.12 --> 744.5
third one wasn't really

745.26 --> 749.519
and then I had a whole bunch of like

747.18 --> 750.899
sporadic girlfriends and

749.519 --> 753.44
but

750.899 --> 756.3
like even that with that it's like

753.44 --> 758.22
smoking cannabis it's really not when I

756.3 --> 759.7199999999999
had the best times the best times I've

758.22 --> 762.72
had with girls

759.72 --> 765.9590000000001
is just me

762.72 --> 768.6600000000001
being completely me and I'm just I get

765.959 --> 770.9399999999999
like so much energy

768.66 --> 774.98
like I don't want I don't need some kind

770.94 --> 774.98
of drug I just don't need anything else

776.519 --> 781.1
I had that with my ex for like two years

778.74 --> 781.1
straight

781.38 --> 786.779
but then she kind of started to hook off

784.019 --> 788.1
she I guess losing interest and then

786.779 --> 790.62
yeah

788.1 --> 792.1800000000001
then it get everything gets compromised

790.62 --> 794.779
and it doesn't work anymore all of a

792.18 --> 794.779
sudden so

795.49 --> 798.879
[Music]

799.8 --> 803.9399999999999
well I'm not really actively looking or

802.62 --> 805.26
anything

803.94 --> 809.1800000000001
I'm just

805.26 --> 812.639
I mean I still want to eventually

809.18 --> 814.16
eventually maybe not to do this in

812.639 --> 818.04
future

814.16 --> 820.3199999999999
find a good woman yeah

818.04 --> 822.3
but I have to be good too because that

820.32 --> 824.12
is part of the problem it kind of went

822.3 --> 827.459
wrong with my ex even though it wasn't

824.12 --> 829.68
exclusively the issue because

827.459 --> 831.18
if it would have been then I would have

829.68 --> 833.279
probably overcome it

831.18 --> 835.62
but there were other there were problems

833.279 --> 838.019
of incompatibility and like she like

835.62 --> 841.7
real me didn't want children and that's

838.019 --> 841.7
kind of a deal breaker for me

844.82 --> 848.899
because then I'd be stuck

849.6 --> 853.38
and then I'd start to resent her for

852.54 --> 856.48
that anyway

853.38 --> 856.48
[Music]

856.92 --> 863.0999999999999
but I still loved her a lot

860.36 --> 864.899
but that changes everything that changes

863.1 --> 867.0790000000001
the amount of power I have available to

864.899 --> 867.079
me

881.76 --> 888.86
right and beside yeah beside that she

884.699 --> 888.8599999999999
also like weird impulsively

889.92 --> 895.3199999999999
bad feminist pickup habits not like

893.04 --> 897.8389999999999
whining or anything but just like she

895.32 --> 900.6600000000001
tried to really manipulate me and like

897.839 --> 903.1800000000001
suddenly break me at times

900.66 --> 905.519
like a trick

903.18 --> 907.8599999999999
and that was really shocking to me like

905.519 --> 910.26
because she was like almost Psychopathic

907.86 --> 912.1800000000001
about it didn't really see I wonder if

910.26 --> 916.16
she consciously even realized what she

912.18 --> 916.16
was doing then at certain times

916.98 --> 920.76
I really don't know with her she was

918.72 --> 923.639
really smart but sometimes she could be

920.76 --> 925.38
like possessed and then

923.639 --> 929.36
she didn't understand literally she

925.38 --> 929.36
couldn't like explain what she was doing

929.82 --> 935.7600000000001
it's really weird

932.42 --> 939.0
interesting though but I mean

935.76 --> 941.639
not very stable maybe that is the reason

939.0 --> 943.8
why she she refused to be a mother

941.639 --> 947.76
because she had that ability of just

943.8 --> 949.3199999999999
suddenly turning wild almost demonic

947.76 --> 951.0
and she had maybe she didn't have

949.32 --> 953.0400000000001
control of it it wasn't really even a

951.0 --> 955.62
conversation but because it didn't like

953.04 --> 957.5999999999999
continually happen or anything

955.62 --> 960.48
right It's just sometimes so all of a

957.6 --> 962.4590000000001
sudden and yeah that that could be very

960.48 --> 963.899
dangerous trade to have if you have your

962.459 --> 967.459
own children

963.899 --> 967.459
so maybe that was I don't know

967.92 --> 975.06
this is all weird speculation I

972.18 --> 977.519
shouldn't even talk about it

975.06 --> 979.7399999999999
there were issues and that also caused

977.519 --> 982.74
me to drop my energy levels and then I

979.74 --> 985.6800000000001
couldn't be

982.74 --> 988.44
a lover like like a really loving

985.68 --> 990.3599999999999
everything that I do and

988.44 --> 993.6
like really wanting to take care of her

990.36 --> 996.54
it didn't work anymore then

993.6 --> 998.4590000000001
I still kind of did it but it was almost

996.54 --> 1002.259
more like a duty now

998.459 --> 1005.8389999999999
I was I guess trying to emulate

1002.259 --> 1008.48
emulate marriage it was really yeah

1005.839 --> 1011.48
in that sense I was like kind of going

1008.48 --> 1014.32
crazy because I was just not accepting

1011.48 --> 1014.32
the situation

1015.62 --> 1021.259
why am I whining about

1017.66 --> 1023.3
uh ex-relationship during my birthday I

1021.259 --> 1024.26
shouldn't be doing that that's a waste

1023.3 --> 1026.74
of time

1024.26 --> 1026.74
oh

1027.74 --> 1029.74
um

1030.98 --> 1035.8600000000001
but yeah I've never lost like a

1032.9 --> 1035.8600000000001
girlfriend to drinking

1036.559 --> 1038.799
foreign

1040.179 --> 1047.0
guys well know them I know them through

1044.5 --> 1049.46
lady friends and girlfriends

1047.0 --> 1051.62
ex-girlfriends in this case

1049.46 --> 1053.96
there's a lot of guys

1051.62 --> 1056.6599999999999
that have alcohol issues

1053.96 --> 1059.1200000000001
and they absolutely break relationship

1056.66 --> 1061.64
duration did breaks apart because of

1059.12 --> 1063.799
that so I definitely understand how that

1061.64 --> 1066.38
can work

1063.799 --> 1068.059
get a lot of spiritual metadata through

1066.38 --> 1069.2600000000002
that so I can even though I've never met

1068.059 --> 1073.96
the person don't know what they look

1069.26 --> 1073.96
like I can exactly figure it out

1075.2 --> 1077.799
anyway

1079.22 --> 1085.0
to hold the line

1081.82 --> 1085.0
all right

1090.89 --> 1095.7800000000002
[Applause]

1092.38 --> 1098.0590000000002
all right by the way

1095.78 --> 1100.28
anybody's like tuning in that's a girl

1098.059 --> 1102.86
and it's like hey oh he's a badger oh

1100.28 --> 1104.66
yeah I might try something

1102.86 --> 1108.08
yeah you don't have to worry just

1104.66 --> 1110.179
because I really talk about details in

1108.08 --> 1111.74
my life and interactions

1110.179 --> 1114.98
like

1111.74 --> 1117.6200000000001
I'm not gonna if I'd ever like get into

1114.98 --> 1119.24
a relationship and still do the show

1117.62 --> 1120.799
while I was still doing the show like

1119.24 --> 1124.64
I'm not gonna like

1120.799 --> 1127.82
gush and talk everything about you

1124.64 --> 1130.16
in details I'll keep everything kind of

1127.82 --> 1133.039
meta so that I I won't

1130.16 --> 1134.66
basically reveal anything personal I

1133.039 --> 1137.24
don't do that

1134.66 --> 1139.1000000000001
in general like I I still don't do that

1137.24 --> 1141.559
with people that I haven't even seen

1139.1 --> 1144.34
like in 20 years

1141.559 --> 1144.34
so

1146.299 --> 1151.299
I like spill my guts about everything

1148.94 --> 1155.6200000000001
that is like me

1151.299 --> 1155.62
not the people I'm close to

1159.32 --> 1164.36
a club Ruckus good to see you

1162.02 --> 1165.86
I don't remember now rum can taste

1164.36 --> 1168.62
really nice

1165.86 --> 1171.5
good memories of that

1168.62 --> 1174.4599999999998
but yeah not

1171.5 --> 1174.46
not doing that

1175.28 --> 1180.52
but I really do like the taste of some

1177.919 --> 1180.5200000000002
good rums

1188.9 --> 1193.22
it's kind of funny because my My

1191.299 --> 1196.48
grandmother used to be a bit of a rum

1193.22 --> 1196.48
Drinker when she was older

1199.94 --> 1203.919
it's only once a week is that okay

1203.96 --> 1209.24
right well I'm not trying any alcohol

1206.6 --> 1211.58
things anytime soon

1209.24 --> 1213.919
I mean I had said for myself like yeah I

1211.58 --> 1217.76
can take a beer once a week and I'm just

1213.919 --> 1220.64
like I'm not doing it I'm just I'm just

1217.76 --> 1222.919
choosing not to so I'm not

1220.64 --> 1225.039
not gonna try anything else now all of a

1222.919 --> 1225.039
sudden

1230.539 --> 1238.12
but hey if you're enjoying that and you

1232.4 --> 1238.1200000000001
got that all under control then why not

1241.22 --> 1243.7
anyway

1245.179 --> 1247.419
foreign

1270.86 --> 1274.4189999999999
part two all right

1277.7 --> 1283.1000000000001
right yeah I get that clap rockers

1280.1 --> 1284.6599999999999
because for me rum has not really been

1283.1 --> 1286.6999999999998
for the alcohol

1284.66 --> 1288.94
it was always like oh it just tastes so

1286.7 --> 1288.94
nice

1294.679 --> 1299.179
I mean when I do drink for the ALCO it's

1297.62 --> 1302.9599999999998
definitely beer

1299.179 --> 1305.3600000000001
definitely like because anything else

1302.96 --> 1307.4
when I like start to really drink

1305.36 --> 1311.8999999999999
quantities for the alcohol

1307.4 --> 1312.98
like that's just terrible for my system

1311.9 --> 1316.3400000000001
like

1312.98 --> 1318.88
even when it was like a team it was like

1316.34 --> 1318.8799999999999
just

1320.059 --> 1325.34
I never got much fun out of it but a lot

1322.64 --> 1328.419
of terrible times

1325.34 --> 1331.4599999999998
I did get out of it

1328.419 --> 1332.659
when with beer I never really had that

1331.46 --> 1335.299
issue

1332.659 --> 1337.2800000000002
I've never like got well I had like

1335.299 --> 1342.22
hangovers

1337.28 --> 1342.22
but never like really serious situations

1342.919 --> 1345.919
foreign

1346.16 --> 1349.299
[Music]

1354.08 --> 1360.76
I've gotten me more serious situations

1356.299 --> 1360.76
because of like absent and [ __ ]

1360.799 --> 1367.179
never touching that [ __ ] again

1363.44 --> 1367.179
oh so done with that

1367.95 --> 1371.15
[Music]

1385.46 --> 1390.8600000000001
I never ever want to wake up you know

1388.28 --> 1393.32
from a drink again now that's what

1390.86 --> 1396.58
everybody says that does still drink but

1393.32 --> 1396.58
I get it yeah

1399.5 --> 1403.22
foreign

1401.02 --> 1406.76
policy for a long time that's why I

1403.22 --> 1409.1000000000001
stuck to three beers and kind of yeah

1406.76 --> 1412.76
that kept everything in check

1409.1 --> 1416.6789999999999
but just not drinking entirely

1412.76 --> 1416.679
makes it a lot better even

1419.299 --> 1425.179
it's such a weird contrast with in the

1422.419 --> 1427.7800000000002
past because in the past if I'd be sober

1425.179 --> 1429.98
I'd be constantly burdening myself

1427.78 --> 1433.24
psychosomatically I would literally

1429.98 --> 1433.24
stress myself out

1433.34 --> 1439.22
there's all kinds of things

1435.38 --> 1441.5590000000002
but now I've worked so long consciously

1439.22 --> 1443.9
even though I have been like under

1441.559 --> 1445.82
cannabis and drinking beer sometimes

1443.9 --> 1447.38
those things

1445.82 --> 1450.5
I've just

1447.38 --> 1453.14
I work different I don't ballast myself

1450.5 --> 1456.52
as much psychosomatically I've learned

1453.14 --> 1456.5200000000002
to kind of stop doing that

1457.1 --> 1461.6589999999999
so now being sober suddenly Works a

1460.159 --> 1463.0390000000002
whole lot better

1461.659 --> 1466.8400000000001
laughs

1463.039 --> 1466.84
like it really does

1468.14 --> 1474.0200000000002
right but

1470.72 --> 1476.299
I mean why do people start drinking like

1474.02 --> 1478.34
like almost like alcoholics it's really

1476.299 --> 1480.32
to just deal with situations where they

1478.34 --> 1483.08
just can't deal with it so it really

1480.32 --> 1485.299
like they it's too punishing then they

1483.08 --> 1488.86
do that until it kind of like

1485.299 --> 1488.86
stops being so intense

1488.9 --> 1494.1200000000001
and then you should quit

1491.419 --> 1496.96
and some people then don't they stay

1494.12 --> 1496.9599999999998
stuck into that

1498.559 --> 1502.6399999999999
but if you do yeah then it's kind of

1500.72 --> 1504.44
like yeah you used it almost as a

1502.64 --> 1506.72
medicine as a suppression medicine like

1504.44 --> 1510.94
you have some joy and

1506.72 --> 1510.94
like you don't carry as much weight

1512.96 --> 1516.799
and yeah you might get a little sick you

1514.94 --> 1519.98
might function it just slightly less

1516.799 --> 1521.96
well overall but

1519.98 --> 1524.24
most people could still probably get

1521.96 --> 1525.38
around with that easily and then after a

1524.24 --> 1527.48
while

1525.38 --> 1532.1000000000001
like the the punishment from the inside

1527.48 --> 1535.1
kind of dies down and then you can stop

1532.1 --> 1539.059
you could stop and then it'd be a whole

1535.1 --> 1541.3999999999999
lot more pleasant to be sober again

1539.059 --> 1543.62
right and for me

1541.4 --> 1546.26
I think that I kind of started beer

1543.62 --> 1549.4399999999998
because it was just though because of

1546.26 --> 1552.7
all the gamma rage I think out there

1549.44 --> 1557.3600000000001
because of trolls because of friction

1552.7 --> 1559.0
among flat earthers friction with me and

1557.36 --> 1561.799
the guys

1559.0 --> 1564.559
just just so much friction everywhere

1561.799 --> 1566.72
and the alcohol just made it like

1564.559 --> 1569.059
like yeah I don't give a [ __ ] like let

1566.72 --> 1571.159
it all happen man like I'm okay with it

1569.059 --> 1572.6589999999999
that's part of the reason why I guess I

1571.159 --> 1575.0800000000002
kind of started drinking on a daily

1572.659 --> 1575.0800000000002
basis

1576.14 --> 1582.26
because I could just I overall even when

1579.08 --> 1584.9189999999999
I'm sober I just be more impulsive and

1582.26 --> 1584.919
care less

1586.4 --> 1592.419
like be less burdened about it

1589.46 --> 1592.419
by myself

1592.94 --> 1595.0
um

1597.32 --> 1604.299
hey two wolf 77

1600.559 --> 1604.299
thanks for your birthday

1605.12 --> 1608.1399999999999
uh Cleary

1612.93 --> 1616.4
[Music]

1626.02 --> 1630.46
hmm that's weird letters eight

1631.34 --> 1634.9599999999998
you feel like you had no control

1636.44 --> 1641.6200000000001
that's so weird because with me it does

1638.539 --> 1641.62
exactly the opposite

1657.26 --> 1662.36
even though it it does the opposite I

1660.08 --> 1664.1589999999999
mean you are not more in control when

1662.36 --> 1667.1
you're drunk but

1664.159 --> 1669.919
for me it's just like yeah

1667.1 --> 1672.62
well maybe you're talking about drunk

1669.919 --> 1674.96
like I haven't really been drunk like

1672.62 --> 1678.34
since

1674.96 --> 1678.3400000000001
since in my 20s

1678.74 --> 1685.0
like really like a lot of it like a lot

1681.919 --> 1688.279
of beer and then really get like

1685.0 --> 1691.9
dude like

1688.279 --> 1691.9
I haven't had that in a long time

1698.539 --> 1702.919
but I don't care about that I don't

1701.0 --> 1704.779
think that's interesting whenever that

1702.919 --> 1707.659
happened

1704.779 --> 1710.9
this I'd be very enjoying it but also

1707.659 --> 1712.94
like get this weird intuitive signal in

1710.9 --> 1715.52
my head like really is like something

1712.94 --> 1716.779
that even though I was drunk then I'd

1715.52 --> 1719.48
feel like

1716.779 --> 1722.36
this is going to make me stupid like

1719.48 --> 1724.94
this is like I can feel like this is

1722.36 --> 1727.76
damaging

1724.94 --> 1729.74
my abilities like this is gonna leave

1727.76 --> 1731.72
damage like even though it's slightly

1729.74 --> 1734.539
but it's just still that warning signal

1731.72 --> 1737.779
like something is like slowly starting

1734.539 --> 1740.12
to crumble at the surface like that a

1737.779 --> 1743.12
very ominous feeling so I ne like I

1740.12 --> 1746.059
always avoid it being drunk to me like

1743.12 --> 1748.76
actually being drunk not just a bit

1746.059 --> 1750.98
tipsy a couple of beers but actually

1748.76 --> 1754.94
really drunk always felt like that is

1750.98 --> 1757.46
like an act of self-destruction

1754.94 --> 1760.159
and people that are really drunk

1757.46 --> 1762.32
alcoholics that I've seen were really

1760.159 --> 1765.38
self-destructive

1762.32 --> 1767.9189999999999
so that made a lot of sense overall

1765.38 --> 1767.919
right

1768.02 --> 1772.779
and I never really did that

1773.84 --> 1777.58
I'd accidentally get drunk

1777.679 --> 1782.299
because I got too enthusiastic drank too

1780.14 --> 1784.88
much too quick right

1782.299 --> 1786.62
but never like oh I'm gonna drink myself

1784.88 --> 1790.88
into Oblivion

1786.62 --> 1794.6789999999999
because life sucks and I sucker like

1790.88 --> 1794.679
that never never

1796.88 --> 1801.919
although I did kind of try to do

1799.159 --> 1803.659
escapism when I felt terrible

1801.919 --> 1807.5
using cannabis

1803.659 --> 1810.679
which was not really all that wise

1807.5 --> 1815.08
because it also made me kind of spiral

1810.679 --> 1815.0800000000002
sometimes into sort of like anxiety

1816.74 --> 1821.6
right what I should have done is just

1819.32 --> 1824.6589999999999
freaking do [ __ ]

1821.6 --> 1826.8799999999999
and like force myself through the

1824.659 --> 1829.5390000000002
feelings just internal feelings of

1826.88 --> 1829.5390000000002
humiliation

1833.6 --> 1839.24
but like at that time I was just I had a

1837.08 --> 1843.559
lot of like now I'm talking like early

1839.24 --> 1846.26
20s late teens was very

1843.559 --> 1848.12
I had a lot of automated defenses them

1846.26 --> 1850.52
psychologically that I have no control

1848.12 --> 1852.02
over that were only had one goal all of

1850.52 --> 1854.6589999999999
them and it is to

1852.02 --> 1857.6
make people basically stop trying to

1854.659 --> 1860.779
change me or

1857.6 --> 1863.24
tell me what to do

1860.779 --> 1866.179
and I had no control over those impulses

1863.24 --> 1868.1
whatsoever I did not have like I wasn't

1866.179 --> 1871.279
like building an argument it was just

1868.1 --> 1874.1589999999999
like reflexes like no no no no no

1871.279 --> 1875.659
not doing that no

1874.159 --> 1878.179
I don't want that

1875.659 --> 1882.5
a lot of no's

1878.179 --> 1885.14
and that's yeah that's the thing that I

1882.5 --> 1888.02
really regret in my life

1885.14 --> 1890.1200000000001
like that's like probably the overall

1888.02 --> 1890.96
number one is that during that time I

1890.12 --> 1894.5
didn't

1890.96 --> 1897.44
just like Ram through it and like no

1894.5 --> 1899.24
you're just gonna get some stupid job

1897.44 --> 1902.3600000000001
feel really humiliated then you're gonna

1899.24 --> 1905.24
contain all those feelings and not break

1902.36 --> 1908.4799999999998
it apart and you're just gonna [ __ ]

1905.24 --> 1910.58
do it you're just gonna do it and then

1908.48 --> 1912.919
you're a drone and then you can like go

1910.58 --> 1914.1789999999999
wild in your imagination about being a

1912.919 --> 1915.919
[ __ ] drone but it doesn't matter

1914.179 --> 1919.279
because you're gonna just [ __ ] do it

1915.919 --> 1923.0
and you can't let your imagination ruin

1919.279 --> 1925.58
it again I wish I freaking just did that

1923.0 --> 1929.059
and had people that would actually get

1925.58 --> 1932.96
that about me how tough it was and push

1929.059 --> 1936.44
me a bit in a positive way I didn't have

1932.96 --> 1940.0
that everybody in my family was kind of

1936.44 --> 1940.0
like you're the loser

1940.039 --> 1947.0
even though they tried to hide that and

1942.559 --> 1950.08
it's really [ __ ] messed up to be

1947.0 --> 1950.08
around that

1953.02 --> 1958.6399999999999
patronizing everybody was patronizing my

1956.84 --> 1960.86
mother was patronizing

1958.64 --> 1962.24
my brother was patronizing they still

1960.86 --> 1966.2199999999998
meant well

1962.24 --> 1966.22
but they were patronizing

1966.32 --> 1973.22
because I didn't just

1969.799 --> 1976.82
do it I didn't just get this impulse I

1973.22 --> 1980.539
need work I need work I didn't have that

1976.82 --> 1982.1
my work was trying to be creative but I

1980.539 --> 1985.64
was kind of slow

1982.1 --> 1988.1
I didn't realize like you basically have

1985.64 --> 1990.26
to be a freaking slave about whatever

1988.1 --> 1993.08
you're gonna do and

1990.26 --> 1995.48
do it Overkill

1993.08 --> 1998.24
that's the only way to do it I like I

1995.48 --> 2001.6
didn't get that I just couldn't feel it

1998.24 --> 2003.279
it's like it was alien to me all of that

2001.6 --> 2005.1399999999999
the only way to do it is to just

2003.279 --> 2007.6
freaking force it

2005.14 --> 2011.5800000000002
force it until something breaks and then

2007.6 --> 2011.58
as you're broken you still continue

2015.94 --> 2022.539
I've seen other people do that and I

2018.46 --> 2025.8600000000001
would always feel like a deep deep

2022.539 --> 2025.86
sense and Shane

2026.26 --> 2031.26
that I hadn't actually done that in my

2029.14 --> 2031.26
life

2031.779 --> 2037.919
it's literally like I'm seeing them

2033.46 --> 2037.919
Ascend in a way that I didn't

2040.419 --> 2045.7
right and I just nobody respected me for

2043.6 --> 2048.22
that and I guess that still trolls out

2045.7 --> 2051.76
there still are trying to poke me with

2048.22 --> 2054.339
that I guess indirectly said oh where'd

2051.76 --> 2058.5
you get a job yeah yeah because that's

2054.339 --> 2058.5
just so freaking easy for me Isn't it

2060.28 --> 2066.3990000000003
it's not stressful at all and doesn't

2062.74 --> 2070.1189999999997
like completely rear like throw total

2066.399 --> 2072.8199999999997
chaos in my mind and my life that I've

2070.119 --> 2075.4190000000003
really used a lot that well keep myself

2072.82 --> 2075.4190000000003
stable

2085.48 --> 2090.72
hello flatten the Curve

2087.76 --> 2090.7200000000003
that's weird

2092.74 --> 2098.74
I said the [ __ ] are you talking about I

2095.919 --> 2100.7799999999997
don't talk about crack that's disgusting

2098.74 --> 2103.54
why the [ __ ] are you bringing hard drugs

2100.78 --> 2105.28
in my chat get the [ __ ] out

2103.54 --> 2108.0
don't do that Clary I don't like that

2105.28 --> 2108.0
it's not funny

2112.119 --> 2116.52
Nathan may think that's funny I don't

2113.859 --> 2116.52
think that's funny

2118.359 --> 2124.9
start a business I don't even know how

2121.54 --> 2128.079
that works at all I mean I know it like

2124.9 --> 2131.079
it's it's ethereal wise

2128.079 --> 2131.079
theoretically

2134.16 --> 2137.39
[Music]

2140.56 --> 2145.839
I mean the only way I could do that [ __ ]

2143.619 --> 2147.099
and this has always been the issue is if

2145.839 --> 2150.599
I had

2147.099 --> 2150.599
it's in the

2151.359 --> 2158.0789999999997
the old-fashioned craft way you have the

2154.54 --> 2160.72
master and the student that's the way

2158.079 --> 2162.04
the way like and I can be pretty quick

2160.72 --> 2164.3799999999997
with it

2162.04 --> 2166.72
but

2164.38 --> 2169.6800000000003
just starting something out and nothing

2166.72 --> 2169.68
like I

2174.099 --> 2177.48
I just don't get that

2193.48 --> 2199.14
you have to be able to walk what

2196.599 --> 2199.1400000000003
okay

2206.92 --> 2211.0
no for me

2208.48 --> 2213.64
would be nice to have some clothes

2211.0 --> 2217.32
because this is also an issue like my

2213.64 --> 2217.3199999999997
clothes are literally tattered

2218.26 --> 2225.94
and I can't just replace it like I don't

2222.82 --> 2227.56
have the money for that so if I get

2225.94 --> 2230.079
something then I'd go would complete

2227.56 --> 2232.359
well yeah oh how important yeah I could

2230.079 --> 2236.02
completely destroy my image literally

2232.359 --> 2238.119
destroy my image I wouldn't know

2236.02 --> 2241.5
how to

2238.119 --> 2241.5
be anymore

2244.48 --> 2251.619
I would yeah I just wouldn't know

2247.66 --> 2254.2599999999998
I wouldn't know like what to make of how

2251.619 --> 2257.8
people look at me even if I'd completely

2254.26 --> 2259.98
change around my clothing situation and

2257.8 --> 2259.98
everything

2262.06 --> 2267.72
no I own a laundromat huh

2265.18 --> 2267.72
okay

2280.42 --> 2284.4
but how does that even work then

2292.24 --> 2295.02
I mean

2297.579 --> 2301.92
are there Banks involved right

2304.0 --> 2306.42
because

2312.52 --> 2318.22
yeah I don't know how they'd respond

2315.82 --> 2320.44
I'm very outspoken about a whole bunch

2318.22 --> 2322.1189999999997
of things and I feel like if I even try

2320.44 --> 2324.16
to start anything I'm just going to be

2322.119 --> 2327.579
instantly squashed

2324.16 --> 2330.8799999999997
because they literally just want me to

2327.579 --> 2333.4
basically be poor and die

2330.88 --> 2338.099
hopefully kill myself that's probably

2333.4 --> 2338.099
what they want because I am so fanatical

2338.44 --> 2346.9
against the Universal Mind control that

2342.46 --> 2346.9
a lot of Bankers actually uphold

2347.14 --> 2352.2999999999997
so

2348.22 --> 2354.64
like would it even well yeah maybe just

2352.3 --> 2357.2200000000003
I should just try

2354.64 --> 2359.5789999999997
just to see if they do that that's a

2357.22 --> 2359.5789999999997
good point

2361.24 --> 2367.359
right

2362.92 --> 2370.9
if just then I would have to not

2367.359 --> 2373.2999999999997
invest everything I got

2370.9 --> 2375.7000000000003
with debt and all just to try out

2373.3 --> 2378.04
something because then if they'd squish

2375.7 --> 2380.98
me I'd be absolutely [ __ ] and I would

2378.04 --> 2384.579
probably kill myself

2380.98 --> 2387.22
because the thing happened exactly that

2384.579 --> 2391.6800000000003
I always feared would happen then

2387.22 --> 2391.68
right I don't know I this is

2398.98 --> 2404.02
just way

2401.859 --> 2406.74
too hectic at this point

2404.02 --> 2406.74
I mean

2407.32 --> 2412.599
being on this show doing my flat Earth

2411.04 --> 2415.119
early bird show

2412.599 --> 2417.6400000000003
doing just media research psychology

2415.119 --> 2420.46
research

2417.64 --> 2423.5989999999997
right that is really kind of what I do

2420.46 --> 2423.599
I'm good at that

2425.44 --> 2430.92
what I have been doing I'm good at it I

2428.44 --> 2430.92
know I am

2451.48 --> 2458.099
a steamy Traveler

2454.18 --> 2458.0989999999997
oh this close that close yeah

2459.7 --> 2466.96
it's just this sounds stupid

2464.079 --> 2470.7400000000002
but I've literally always had this issue

2466.96 --> 2473.7400000000002
always it never changed but

2470.74 --> 2476.0789999999997
on average if I'm gonna

2473.74 --> 2479.3799999999997
trying to find clothing I need a woman

2476.079 --> 2481.2400000000002
with me like I really need that doesn't

2479.38 --> 2483.88
have to be my girlfriend

2481.24 --> 2488.52
it just it doesn't work

2483.88 --> 2488.52
I get so flustered and Confused

2490.42 --> 2496.96
like unless I know exactly what I'm

2493.599 --> 2501.76
looking for and I know it's there then

2496.96 --> 2505.7200000000003
then like getting finding clothes works

2501.76 --> 2508.6600000000003
but like trying to find something not

2505.72 --> 2511.1189999999997
knowing exactly like I can't do that I

2508.66 --> 2514.2999999999997
need a woman with me

2511.119 --> 2516.76
they're good at that usually

2514.3 --> 2518.02
like really good at it and they save me

2516.76 --> 2521.079
a lot of time

2518.02 --> 2524.14
and humiliation and they got like well

2521.079 --> 2526.3
another pair of eyes that can see what

2524.14 --> 2528.16
it actually looks like on me from a

2526.3 --> 2531.119
woman's perspective so

2528.16 --> 2531.1189999999997
like yeah

2540.16 --> 2544.56
try your hand it's script writing

2549.04 --> 2553.32
that sounds extremely vague

2558.339 --> 2564.46
I mean I am kind of studying movies

2562.359 --> 2566.44
I mean I have been and I'm trying to

2564.46 --> 2567.64
take it more serious to really figure

2566.44 --> 2571.54
out like

2567.64 --> 2572.98
what is it that makes it it right and

2571.54 --> 2576.099
I've already discovered like how

2572.98 --> 2577.06
important music is but also it's just so

2576.099 --> 2579.94
much

2577.06 --> 2583.859
that I I really don't completely

2579.94 --> 2583.859
understand yet about movie making

2584.26 --> 2589.3
like and I'm enjoying it but I don't

2587.079 --> 2593.46
understand it and I'm kind of like it's

2589.3 --> 2593.46
just taking a long freaking time

2595.66 --> 2599.2799999999997
but like stories

2599.8 --> 2604.38
stories I can very much work with

2606.04 --> 2610.42
right but I'm not like yeah I'm just

2608.44 --> 2611.319
gonna make UPS out something out of

2610.42 --> 2614.079
nothing

2611.319 --> 2617.52
like I just write a script no I'm like

2614.079 --> 2617.52
if somebody has an idea

2617.74 --> 2623.3999999999996
then I'm great at like helping out with

2621.16 --> 2623.3999999999996
that

2626.14 --> 2632.2
like to like give just like modification

2629.74 --> 2636.2799999999997
suggestions with like fractal Insight

2632.2 --> 2639.1189999999997
behind it like yeah that's something

2636.28 --> 2639.119
I'm good at

2650.38 --> 2654.48
music is the key to form your conscious

2657.099 --> 2661.96
well if it's in a movie

2659.26 --> 2664.48
because you that's the funny thing about

2661.96 --> 2667.42
it jado

2664.48 --> 2671.8
you're watching the movie

2667.42 --> 2673.48
the sound is not your main focus like if

2671.8 --> 2675.94
you were like listening to a classical

2673.48 --> 2679.0
piece you basically go in some kind of

2675.94 --> 2682.18
stair and then you listen to the

2679.0 --> 2684.579
instruments right or what's happening

2682.18 --> 2686.14
like that and maybe an imagination that

2684.579 --> 2687.88
they conjure up

2686.14 --> 2691.359
that's the difference but if you're

2687.88 --> 2693.819
watching a movie you're watching what's

2691.359 --> 2696.52
taking place following the story based

2693.819 --> 2698.44
on the visuals and the music becomes

2696.52 --> 2701.2
secondary

2698.44 --> 2704.68
to your direct to your attention you see

2701.2 --> 2707.68
and so that way because it's not the

2704.68 --> 2712.2999999999997
primary thing you're focusing on it is

2707.68 --> 2714.52
much more directly influential over your

2712.3 --> 2717.819
feelings

2714.52 --> 2719.68
because your Consciousness isn't focused

2717.819 --> 2721.18
on the music and that's like the trick

2719.68 --> 2724.359
of it

2721.18 --> 2727.1189999999997
it's really like basic stage magician

2724.359 --> 2729.88
trick in that sense right

2727.119 --> 2732.099
it's there it's the main thing but it's

2729.88 --> 2734.26
not grabbing your attention in the

2732.099 --> 2736.06
meantime The Magician's doing this while

2734.26 --> 2738.94
you're being influenced by this over

2736.06 --> 2741.4
there that's kind of not so much in your

2738.94 --> 2744.099
attention that's the trick of music

2741.4 --> 2747.9
influence in movies

2744.099 --> 2747.9
I understand how it works

2748.48 --> 2754.599
but I'm not like a guy who's who would

2751.599 --> 2758.8
be good at doing it himself who would

2754.599 --> 2762.52
actually assemble the music to do that

2758.8 --> 2767.8
but I get it and I'd be

2762.52 --> 2770.98
like happy to give suggestions on like

2767.8 --> 2773.5
how to guide the feelings

2770.98 --> 2776.8
of like a scene or like how to express

2773.5 --> 2779.38
it but I wouldn't then be the editor who

2776.8 --> 2781.48
actually assembles that music to

2779.38 --> 2785.56
accomplish that effect

2781.48 --> 2788.319
I'm not I'm very not good at using or

2785.56 --> 2790.48
being creative myself with music to

2788.319 --> 2793.42
influence people I am just like a

2790.48 --> 2796.38
sorcerer I like not a sorcerer a source

2793.42 --> 2796.38
I just

2796.78 --> 2802.48
I picked the the the pieces that like

2800.26 --> 2805.1800000000003
are the most impressive to me and I kind

2802.48 --> 2808.0
of collect them like gems that's what

2805.18 --> 2810.8799999999997
I've always done with music

2808.0 --> 2812.68
and I study them over and over again

2810.88 --> 2816.099
and study them in different states of

2812.68 --> 2818.2
mind and like that's what I do more an

2816.099 --> 2820.6600000000003
analyst

2818.2 --> 2823.06
I've never like been eager to like oh

2820.66 --> 2825.0989999999997
let's try some music oh let's see what

2823.06 --> 2826.66
you feel like I don't play music on my

2825.099 --> 2828.099
show there's only one song and that's

2826.66 --> 2830.0989999999997
the intro song

2828.099 --> 2834.1600000000003
right

2830.099 --> 2835.6600000000003
or if somebody made a song like LSG and

2834.16 --> 2837.2799999999997
then I play it because they requested

2835.66 --> 2840.3999999999996
because they made it themselves and

2837.28 --> 2844.38
that's different or chocolates rap

2840.4 --> 2844.38
right chocolate saying

2845.859 --> 2847.92
um

2851.26 --> 2858.2200000000003
can give money to a direct druggy

2854.56 --> 2862.14
homeless if he asked you to what

2858.22 --> 2862.14
me no

2862.48 --> 2866.28
I don't I can't afford that

2867.819 --> 2872.619
but in the past like

2870.64 --> 2873.819
there's been like druggies that would

2872.619 --> 2876.1600000000003
ask me

2873.819 --> 2878.18
for money or something and I'd like give

2876.16 --> 2879.94
them a pre-rolled joint

2878.18 --> 2881.9199999999996
[Music]

2879.94 --> 2885.4
I've done that in the past

2881.92 --> 2887.38
and they always accepted that

2885.4 --> 2890.38
maybe because they could sell it or

2887.38 --> 2893.7000000000003
something but I mean it's my own rolling

2890.38 --> 2893.7000000000003
I did that sort of thing

2903.94 --> 2907.9
and there's some homeless here that in

2906.22 --> 2910.8999999999996
times when I'm really doing well which

2907.9 --> 2913.54
hasn't been there for a while but still

2910.9 --> 2915.88
sometimes like

2913.54 --> 2919.06
well since I lived here pretty much up

2915.88 --> 2919.06
until 2000

2919.18 --> 2925.8999999999996
2019 uh 20.

2922.599 --> 2929.56
I have sometimes just given some change

2925.9 --> 2931.359
to certain homeless people that hang

2929.56 --> 2933.52
around

2931.359 --> 2934.18
like the supermarket that I typically go

2933.52 --> 2936.66
to

2934.18 --> 2936.66
but

2938.74 --> 2944.3999999999996
I mean yeah I don't

2941.44 --> 2944.4
why bring that out

2960.579 --> 2966.2200000000003
I don't get it blue pill Evolution I

2963.88 --> 2969.339
don't understand what this writing a

2966.22 --> 2972.64
good script is you're gonna have to

2969.339 --> 2974.98
not here in the chat but like on a Skype

2972.64 --> 2976.42
call or something really explain that to

2974.98 --> 2979.54
me how that works

2976.42 --> 2981.1800000000003
I don't want that here in my show thank

2979.54 --> 2982.7799999999997
you

2981.18 --> 2985.18
don't

2982.78 --> 2987.2200000000003
there's no point

2985.18 --> 2989.2
but yeah maybe I could try something

2987.22 --> 2991.66
like that if once I really understand

2989.2 --> 2993.0989999999997
what that is actually yeah what that's

2991.66 --> 2994.72
like

2993.099 --> 2997.26
they'll have to give me like an example

2994.72 --> 2997.2599999999998
and all that

3002.16 --> 3005.1189999999997
let's save the cat

3005.579 --> 3008.3590000000004
okay

3009.0 --> 3012.68
can I find that online

3018.42 --> 3021.42
screenwriting

3031.14 --> 3033.859
okay

3044.04 --> 3047.04
foreign

3049.52 --> 3053.24
place okay

3059.24 --> 3064.3799999999997
okay it looks interesting it's not super

3061.92 --> 3066.839
expensive or anything but

3064.38 --> 3069.839
unless somebody can find like a PDF of

3066.839 --> 3073.52
that online I'm not gonna be getting

3069.839 --> 3073.52
that anytime soon I mean

3073.68 --> 3075.859
foreign

3081.72 --> 3088.02
maybe if I had some money like I don't

3084.72 --> 3089.9399999999996
know birthday money perhaps something

3088.02 --> 3092.42
I don't know

3089.94 --> 3092.42
yeah

3096.44 --> 3104.18
if you donate 20 euros to me I could

3100.44 --> 3104.18
literally just order it right now

3112.14 --> 3115.14
foreign

3117.42 --> 3124.4
it might be interesting to look into

3120.18 --> 3124.3999999999996
if it's really a good book as you say

3126.119 --> 3131.78
15 years right so it's been fireproof

3129.24 --> 3131.7799999999997
and that's good

3137.579 --> 3143.1600000000003
okay series it's a series what

3140.37 --> 3145.7599999999998
[Music]

3143.16 --> 3145.7599999999998
foreign

3161.7 --> 3166.74
sent me

3163.319 --> 3169.52
32 euros and then I can get a hardcover

3166.74 --> 3169.52
version of it

3199.38 --> 3204.42
but you don't need the hardcover

3202.5 --> 3208.339
okay

3204.42 --> 3208.339
well then I'll still meet 20 euros

3227.16 --> 3232.22
don't feel oblate what yeah kind of

3235.26 --> 3238.88
right anyway thanks

3259.319 --> 3264.54
thank you

3261.319 --> 3266.2799999999997
I think that it's probably well I'm not

3264.54 --> 3267.18
entirely sure what that book's going to

3266.28 --> 3270.0
be like

3267.18 --> 3273.0
but it could be really good

3270.0 --> 3275.64
if I'm actually gonna like get skills

3273.0 --> 3278.64
and like expert knowledge on well

3275.64 --> 3282.2999999999997
screenplay about out of it if it's like

3278.64 --> 3284.7599999999998
a sort of instructional book a bit

3282.3 --> 3287.48
that would be great

3284.76 --> 3287.48
is it

3297.14 --> 3303.74
it's all about structure

3301.079 --> 3303.7400000000002
cool

3307.98 --> 3313.02
can't recommend okay fine

3311.22 --> 3316.64
you're all important I'm gonna get that

3313.02 --> 3316.64
book I'm gonna check it out and

3317.83 --> 3321.0
[Music]

3326.4 --> 3330.02
interesting again how

3330.3 --> 3337.4
like this show is just nothing to do

3333.0 --> 3337.4
with this up with the title I gave it

3339.18 --> 3344.0989999999997
this is another generalized the

3341.76 --> 3344.88
statement the critical positions we

3344.099 --> 3348.1400000000003
share

3344.88 --> 3348.1400000000003
although it is something

3359.819 --> 3362.359
ah

3363.24 --> 3366.02
thank you

3366.059 --> 3370.8590000000004
thank you blue build Evolution for the

3368.28 --> 3374.42
PayPal donation

3370.859 --> 3374.42
so much you appreciate it

3382.079 --> 3386.119
and I guess I'm gonna order that book

3388.2 --> 3394.98
right something just

3392.819 --> 3399.42
I don't know man I got I I really got

3394.98 --> 3402.18
the springs in me like springtime

3399.42 --> 3404.9
I'm just like I want I want to break out

3402.18 --> 3404.8999999999996
of this [ __ ]

3405.78 --> 3408.98
what the

3440.579 --> 3443.1800000000003
what

3444.359 --> 3447.14
a

3450.78 --> 3454.0400000000004
and it's done

3457.26 --> 3461.5400000000004
right just get stuff going I mean

3463.5 --> 3469.819
in the past I've been like I'm going

3466.319 --> 3469.819
about things the wrong way

3470.04 --> 3475.02
this works better

3472.14 --> 3476.339
right I mean there's like

3475.02 --> 3479.4
I need

3476.339 --> 3482.7
well some extra maintenance support for

3479.4 --> 3486.48
my life situation that is one thing but

3482.7 --> 3489.8999999999996
like if I just only focus on that and

3486.48 --> 3492.359
never like any try like get stuff that

3489.9 --> 3494.04
could help my development then how am I

3492.359 --> 3495.96
ever gonna get out of it I need to

3494.04 --> 3497.4
change that so this would be a great

3495.96 --> 3499.559
thing to do it's just something that oh

3497.4 --> 3502.859
you guys think it really helped me

3499.559 --> 3505.26
well then help me get that and don't say

3502.859 --> 3508.98
oh you don't have to no just say it like

3505.26 --> 3512.46
I'm giving you this buy this book with

3508.98 --> 3516.72
it just don't be oh you don't know say

3512.46 --> 3519.66
it say that don't be freaking modest you

3516.72 --> 3522.9599999999996
just say no get this book with it don't

3519.66 --> 3524.819
say oh you don't have to no say you have

3522.96 --> 3529.04
to

3524.819 --> 3529.04
and then things actually happen

3531.119 --> 3536.2200000000003
yeah

3532.5 --> 3538.619
if you send me money and say do this

3536.22 --> 3541.2
then I will do it

3538.619 --> 3544.26
and I wouldn't even care about like oh

3541.2 --> 3546.1189999999997
but I actually wanted to eat today well

3544.26 --> 3548.94
guess what too bad because you gave me

3546.119 --> 3550.92
the money specifically to get that

3548.94 --> 3552.66
and then I will unless of course it's

3550.92 --> 3555.2400000000002
like something

3552.66 --> 3557.64
sarcastic or whatever like oh get the

3555.24 --> 3559.9199999999996
words with this yeah then I'm just not

3557.64 --> 3562.799
gonna do that of course

3559.92 --> 3565.339
I'm not an idiot

3562.799 --> 3565.339
but

3572.04 --> 3579.48
there's departments at Studios that what

3576.839 --> 3582.98
will I Market my scripts I have

3579.48 --> 3582.98
absolutely no idea

3593.819 --> 3598.98
but I mean if I'm gonna be like this

3596.839 --> 3602.04
doing that

3598.98 --> 3603.599
then I know if a friend who would

3602.04 --> 3605.7599999999998
probably know a little bit more because

3603.599 --> 3607.02
she's like really she actually wants to

3605.76 --> 3610.1600000000003
make movies

3607.02 --> 3610.16
so that's kind of funny

3610.44 --> 3615.66
if I could be a screen playing writer we

3613.68 --> 3616.5589999999997
might even like work together at some

3615.66 --> 3621.3799999999997
point

3616.559 --> 3621.38
if that's viable I don't I'm not sure

3628.099 --> 3633.1800000000003
okay blue pill evolution

3631.26 --> 3636.119
well then next time don't give me a

3633.18 --> 3640.0989999999997
potentially great idea

3636.119 --> 3640.099
ah sorry I'm just being weird about it

3645.54 --> 3648.72
arrows and why is the story structure

3647.64 --> 3651.54
yeah

3648.72 --> 3654.299
well probably then if it's really the

3651.54 --> 3658.74
house and wise then

3654.299 --> 3661.92
reading it will be like yeah duh to me

3658.74 --> 3663.299
but still good to have

3661.92 --> 3665.88
and

3663.299 --> 3668.4
if it's a really good book and I and and

3665.88 --> 3669.78
I nothing I could learn from it

3668.4 --> 3672.7200000000003
then I could

3669.78 --> 3675.44
even like give it to somebody else who

3672.72 --> 3675.4399999999996
could learn from it

3679.26 --> 3683.8190000000004
I think you could write a great movie

3680.88 --> 3686.7000000000003
well I've attempted sort of but it was

3683.819 --> 3690.299
more like a rough assembly of like

3686.7 --> 3692.3999999999996
things as they would roll out

3690.299 --> 3694.46
I still have that stuff I could

3692.4 --> 3698.76
potentially

3694.46 --> 3701.119
use this screenwriting thing on my old

3698.76 --> 3701.119
stuff

3701.16 --> 3705.0589999999997
that I still have the whole

3703.619 --> 3711.059
like

3705.059 --> 3714.48
time based story from like 2016

3711.059 --> 3716.3390000000004
I still have a much older like Matrix

3714.48 --> 3719.46
movie

3716.339 --> 3721.2
for no not this one or it could be the

3719.46 --> 3723.42
fifth one I mean you could stick that on

3721.2 --> 3726.359
when whenever you want

3723.42 --> 3728.94
but effectively although yeah I

3726.359 --> 3731.52
but I could just do that try that it

3728.94 --> 3734.18
would have something to do for me

3731.52 --> 3734.18
creatively

3735.299 --> 3741.78
selling store adventure story ideas

3738.78 --> 3741.78
right

3742.2 --> 3746.18
because they never have enough of those

3750.9 --> 3754.7400000000002
no and I don't don't want to do that

3753.18 --> 3757.2799999999997
like

3754.74 --> 3757.2799999999997
no

3758.339 --> 3763.98
if I'd want to make a story about a

3761.52 --> 3766.859
freaking in the video game then it's my

3763.98 --> 3769.2
freaking video game that I make on the

3766.859 --> 3772.92
market like with my company I like I'm

3769.2 --> 3775.859
not gonna give my great ideas to those

3772.92 --> 3778.7400000000002
shitty parasitic companies out there

3775.859 --> 3781.2
and effectively like just make everybody

3778.74 --> 3784.04
miserable with their policies

3781.2 --> 3784.04
no thanks

3784.68 --> 3789.4199999999996
though yeah maybe there are some out

3786.599 --> 3792.26
there that are kind of cool

3789.42 --> 3792.26
I don't know

3793.319 --> 3798.18
but I mean if I could at least attempt

3795.72 --> 3800.04
to make something that is competent then

3798.18 --> 3802.98
I can always figure out what to do with

3800.04 --> 3805.38
it whether I just do nothing with it

3802.98 --> 3808.76
sell it

3805.38 --> 3808.76
or make something with it

3809.579 --> 3813.96
who knows

3812.28 --> 3816.799
I mean I've had some pretty

3813.96 --> 3820.38
revolutionary micro Visions about movies

3816.799 --> 3823.5
that could be made

3820.38 --> 3825.6800000000003
but I just didn't have enough grasp on

3823.5 --> 3825.68
it

3827.88 --> 3832.799
I'm just gonna do something with it okay

3829.98 --> 3834.72
I'm just gonna [ __ ] do something and

3832.799 --> 3837.299
get something done

3834.72 --> 3840.72
instead of just only

3837.299 --> 3843.42
watching Media stuff analyzing it

3840.72 --> 3845.5789999999997
talk about the latest thing and how it

3843.42 --> 3848.64
is [ __ ] and just only do that

3845.579 --> 3849.96
because I'm so freaking sick of just

3848.64 --> 3853.52
doing that

3849.96 --> 3853.52
I need to do something more

3859.5 --> 3865.5
or I'm going to my spirit's gonna go

3861.9 --> 3868.38
extinguished it's just gonna go out I

3865.5 --> 3870.72
need to do something I need to like

3868.38 --> 3872.94
break a new ground of some kind for

3870.72 --> 3875.22
myself I need to do it and I'm gonna do

3872.94 --> 3877.7400000000002
it I I literally ordered the book and

3875.22 --> 3879.9599999999996
I'm gonna [ __ ] do it

3877.74 --> 3883.2599999999998
even if it requires me to freaking hit

3879.96 --> 3886.2200000000003
myself in the face again

3883.26 --> 3888.5
because I'm [ __ ] gonna [ __ ] do it

3886.22 --> 3893.4199999999996
nothing's gonna stop me

3888.5 --> 3893.42
especially me is not gonna stop me

3893.819 --> 3898.339
right this is what I wanted is what I'm

3895.92 --> 3898.339
gonna do

3905.76 --> 3911.099
the point was making money

3908.52 --> 3913.02
that's [ __ ]

3911.099 --> 3914.4
if the point is making money then how

3913.02 --> 3916.319
the hell are you going to find good

3914.4 --> 3919.26
Scripts

3916.319 --> 3921.96
like gonna make that no it has to

3919.26 --> 3924.059
actually mean something otherwise it

3921.96 --> 3929.04
isn't a good script and then it's always

3924.059 --> 3931.26
going to be way more worth it if that oh

3929.04 --> 3933.7799999999997
God

3931.26 --> 3935.42
dude if you're just we're making scripts

3933.78 --> 3939.7200000000003
for money

3935.42 --> 3942.78
just freaking ask chat GPT

3939.72 --> 3945.24
you know how freaking easy that is no

3942.78 --> 3946.98
you you it's got to be revolutionary but

3945.24 --> 3948.7799999999997
if it's going to be revolutionary then

3946.98 --> 3950.339
how who is going to buy it and what the

3948.78 --> 3952.38
[ __ ] are they gonna do with it they're

3950.339 --> 3955.2
probably gonna rape it

3952.38 --> 3957.9
and trademark it or something

3955.2 --> 3961.3799999999997
and then you can't use your brilliant

3957.9 --> 3963.98
ideas anymore that's the [ __ ] that is

3961.38 --> 3963.98
out there too

3964.28 --> 3967.409
[Music]

3971.7 --> 3979.9199999999996
inability to find a job no

3975.9 --> 3983.1600000000003
the inability is just

3979.92 --> 3985.7400000000002
not being able to maintain it that's

3983.16 --> 3989.2799999999997
been the issue I mean

3985.74 --> 3991.68
I could find jobs sure I could

3989.28 --> 3995.3590000000004
problem is is that I'll be surrounded by

3991.68 --> 3995.359
people that have all been broken

3995.7 --> 4001.18
that have absolutely no more care to

3998.52 --> 4001.18
learn anything

4001.28 --> 4005.0
or that are really caught up in the

4003.559 --> 4007.579
machine

4005.0 --> 4009.68
with the latest thing and [ __ ] and I'll

4007.579 --> 4012.7400000000002
feel absolutely [ __ ] miserable and

4009.68 --> 4015.14
then get depressed and then stop

4012.74 --> 4018.02
that's been the issue in the past not

4015.14 --> 4019.94
that I oh I can't find a job or I can't

4018.02 --> 4023.18
do it do I could do pretty much anything

4019.94 --> 4027.2200000000003
unless it's like it just requires a big

4023.18 --> 4027.22
muscly guy which I am not

4038.78 --> 4044.599
but if I'm gonna like be more like I'm

4041.66 --> 4047.0
gonna do it yeah then script writing

4044.599 --> 4049.2200000000003
let's do it first let's do it first

4047.0 --> 4052.4
let's see what I can do with it

4049.22 --> 4053.4199999999996
and why would I just have to sell my

4052.4 --> 4056.14
talent

4053.42 --> 4056.14
like that

4056.48 --> 4062.539
so that other people can claim it and

4059.18 --> 4065.0589999999997
then literally just sell my mental

4062.539 --> 4068.42
Heritage that wouldn't be mine anymore

4065.059 --> 4070.039
it's a terrible idea

4068.42 --> 4071.079
to me

4070.039 --> 4075.38
really

4071.079 --> 4077.059
unless I could like find a method and if

4075.38 --> 4080.2400000000002
I can be very effective without

4077.059 --> 4084.98
literally like locking out my own

4080.24 --> 4086.4799999999996
Brilliance out of my own range then I'd

4084.98 --> 4089.68
love it

4086.48 --> 4089.68
sure I'll do it

4089.96 --> 4094.52
I'm not entirely sure how this works yet

4092.24 --> 4096.62
I'm not entirely sure at all I'm not

4094.52 --> 4099.62
even entirely sure like what the

4096.62 --> 4101.179
screenplay really is is so I'm just

4099.62 --> 4103.2789999999995
gonna read the book

4101.179 --> 4106.64
and I'm gonna figure it out so please

4103.279 --> 4108.4400000000005
let's just hold on further speculation

4106.64 --> 4110.96
about it

4108.44 --> 4112.4
I because I I don't have anything I

4110.96 --> 4114.859
don't really even know what it is

4112.4 --> 4117.0199999999995
actually

4114.859 --> 4119.0
I mean I have a rough idea about it but

4117.02 --> 4121.400000000001
I can't place it

4119.0 --> 4124.339
so let's just see what that book

4121.4 --> 4127.9
is going to teach me

4124.339 --> 4127.9
and then I'll get back to you

4133.46 --> 4138.259
yeah and maybe I'll start like just

4135.859 --> 4139.58
writing I'll just start like writing

4138.259 --> 4141.62
scripts

4139.58 --> 4143.359
maybe like script maybe I'm just gonna

4141.62 --> 4145.339
freaking copy a thing and make it my

4143.359 --> 4147.799
specialty so that I can literally just

4145.339 --> 4150.5599999999995
on the spot just write any kind of

4147.799 --> 4153.56
script structure instantaneously

4150.56 --> 4158.06
I think I could if I get into that

4153.56 --> 4160.9400000000005
I could get really incredibly good at it

4158.06 --> 4164.179
I kind of know I can because I am about

4160.94 --> 4167.7789999999995
structure everything I do is about

4164.179 --> 4171.319
structure in in my mind

4167.779 --> 4176.4800000000005
is literally the the fractal implication

4171.319 --> 4176.4800000000005
of things is literally structure

4179.66 --> 4183.199
anyway

4181.46 --> 4185.4800000000005
so yeah I'm

4183.199 --> 4189.16
gonna go on some Adventure or something

4185.48 --> 4189.16
with this and we'll see

4190.64 --> 4196.84
it's gonna be there in

4192.859 --> 4196.84
is it by Wednesday I think

4199.88 --> 4204.1
right so let's move on for a bit

4205.82 --> 4210.34
still got another 50 minutes to go

4217.76 --> 4222.14
all right

4219.62 --> 4224.42
and you know what if I'm not going to

4222.14 --> 4227.179
become some professional script writer

4224.42 --> 4232.219
out of it I will sure as hell

4227.179 --> 4234.56
make a better game master using it

4232.219 --> 4238.76
because I've had some issues

4234.56 --> 4242.120000000001
with game mastering where I'd make it so

4238.76 --> 4245.12
living so like a simulation that's

4242.12 --> 4246.739
happening like in which the players are

4245.12 --> 4249.199
that

4246.739 --> 4252.0199999999995
Things become like too real

4249.199 --> 4253.5199999999995
and then I get stuck like I get stuck

4252.02 --> 4255.92
because

4253.52 --> 4260.96
I'm just trying to make everything

4255.92 --> 4262.76
realistic and then lose like I lose the

4260.96 --> 4266.06
the

4262.76 --> 4268.88
storyline becomes slightly incohesive

4266.06 --> 4270.860000000001
and I improvise my way around it but I

4268.88 --> 4274.34
mean maybe this book could even just

4270.86 --> 4276.799999999999
help with that so that ahead of time I

4274.34 --> 4279.8
can already know how things will roll

4276.8 --> 4282.8
out like so I have a script structure in

4279.8 --> 4286.4800000000005
mind to guide me as a game master

4282.8 --> 4286.4800000000005
I think it could even help for that

4287.5 --> 4292.239
hey Amanda young thank you

4300.5 --> 4306.1

4302.84 --> 4306.1

how old am I now 43.

4589.88 --> 4592.06
foreign

4597.56 --> 4601.179
that's hilarious Lynn Lennox

4608.719 --> 4612.9800000000005
well it's not a rotation I mean the

4610.58 --> 4615.94
earth rotation is a day supposedly in

4612.98 --> 4615.94
heliocentrism

4616.28 --> 4621.04
but it's a circle around the Sun

4625.04 --> 4628.179
that's a year

4629.54 --> 4635.78
but it's not a rotation it's just a path

4632.84 --> 4637.219
in heliocentrism that is we 50 tomorrow

4635.78 --> 4638.659
really

4637.219 --> 4642.159
okay

4638.659 --> 4642.159
well happy birthday already

4648.76 --> 4657.1
I can't believe that you're actually 50.

4652.94 --> 4657.099999999999
they look way younger than that

4682.159 --> 4687.219
if you take care of yourself yeah I know

4695.36 --> 4698.92
but still I mean

4703.76 --> 4711.280000000001
there are 365 times 43. oh you're

4708.26 --> 4711.280000000001
forgetting the leap years

4728.78 --> 4734.0
so like

4731.659 --> 4736.04
add another 13

4734.0 --> 4739.0
to that

4736.04 --> 4739.0
13 days

4743.54 --> 4748.82
wait is it every four years every four

4746.719 --> 4750.86
years isn't it

4748.82 --> 4754.88
yeah so add another

4750.86 --> 4754.88
11 days whatever

4755.239 --> 4758.199
wow thanks

4768.02 --> 4772.76
ah nice blue pill devolution

4771.199 --> 4775.339999999999
well I can

4772.76 --> 4777.08
I don't look very old and I can seem

4775.34 --> 4779.3
very young

4777.08 --> 4782.239
through my enthusiasm and all that so

4779.3 --> 4785.12
yeah people often still think that I'm

4782.239 --> 4788.178999999999
like 30 or something or even younger

4785.12 --> 4790.159
especially when I get all energetic

4788.179 --> 4793.34
but when I don't get all energetic

4790.159 --> 4796.04
people still think like I'm in my 30s

4793.34 --> 4798.38
but when I get like really energetic

4796.04 --> 4800.48
then people even say like oh you're like

4798.38 --> 4802.46
20 something

4800.48 --> 4805.879999999999
because of the energy

4802.46 --> 4808.1
I do have youthful energy to me when I

4805.88 --> 4811.12
actually get really expressive

4808.1 --> 4811.120000000001
and energetic

4819.52 --> 4824.620000000001
discussion with neighbor letter is

4821.96 --> 4826.88
starting off about the moon

4824.62 --> 4829.699
physicality assumption

4826.88 --> 4832.96
oh that's a challenging one that's

4829.699 --> 4835.759999999999
that's a very big challenge

4832.96 --> 4838.76
that's going to be like with people it's

4835.76 --> 4841.4800000000005
going to be like what what not physical

4838.76 --> 4841.4800000000005
what

4844.46 --> 4850.88
he believed he believes other people can

4848.12 --> 4853.88
lie except scientists

4850.88 --> 4853.88
wow

4854.659 --> 4857.659
wow

4864.86 --> 4869.9
and I mean

4866.78 --> 4872.38
does he also believe that doctors Can Do

4869.9 --> 4872.379999999999
no harm

4873.56 --> 4879.1990000000005
removed him hypocratic oath right yeah

4876.56 --> 4881.0
and some of them don't take it and some

4879.199 --> 4883.639999999999
of them don't give a [ __ ]

4881.0 --> 4885.62
just like some scientists are just in it

4883.64 --> 4889.2390000000005
for the money and they'll put up

4885.62 --> 4889.239
whatever [ __ ] story

4890.659 --> 4896.379999999999
that the person paying them wants them

4894.02 --> 4896.38
to bring

4900.92 --> 4904.06
but yeah anyway

4913.76 --> 4916.6
well you tried

4921.86 --> 4926.5
attitude is big it makes you seem

4923.78 --> 4926.5
younger yeah

4926.9 --> 4930.739
it's kind of funny because when I was

4929.06 --> 4933.26
actually younger I didn't have that

4930.739 --> 4938.0199999999995
attitude I was very timid I was scared

4933.26 --> 4938.02
easily felt fragile a lot

4941.36 --> 4945.98
I would still be energetic but it would

4943.219 --> 4948.88
also be like easily like oh

4945.98 --> 4948.879999999999
a quick hide

4949.76 --> 4952.4800000000005
uh

4954.08 --> 4959.12
unless I was high on sugar or something

4956.48 --> 4962.86
and then I wouldn't hide

4959.12 --> 4962.86
I get over courageous

4965.48 --> 4969.62
you'd look

4967.28 --> 4971.8
younger without the Tash yeah I'm sure I

4969.62 --> 4976.0
would

4971.8 --> 4976.0
why did I like my mustache

4986.36 --> 4992.32
you know that I've never ever had a

4988.82 --> 4992.32
mustache before I grew it here

4992.36 --> 4998.38
those years ago 2000

4995.239 --> 4998.379999999999
2019 was it

5000.58 --> 5006.1
or 18. I'm not sure when I started it

5003.159 --> 5009.04
but I never had one before that and I'm

5006.1 --> 5010.659000000001
liking it I mean it's not like oh wow

5009.04 --> 5012.46
I've got the ultimate Tash or anything

5010.659 --> 5013.78
but I'm still like yeah I kind of like

5012.46 --> 5016.2390000000005
it

5013.78 --> 5017.32
it's funny how it just makes me look

5016.239 --> 5020.28
different

5017.32 --> 5020.28
even to myself

5022.179 --> 5029.64
full-fledged Normie oh dear

5025.42 --> 5029.64
oh dear oh dear oh dear

5044.5 --> 5049.12
just look into everything you're told

5046.96 --> 5053.4
right it's the best you can do and

5049.12 --> 5053.4
they're not going to though probably

5057.219 --> 5061.54
because normies really don't that's why

5059.62 --> 5064.8
they are normies because they don't

5061.54 --> 5064.8
actually look into everything

5066.82 --> 5071.679
like the moment they actually start

5068.86 --> 5073.54
doing that they stop being ignore me and

5071.679 --> 5075.58
then their abnormally life becomes

5073.54 --> 5078.78
ruined and then they turn into

5075.58 --> 5078.78
conspiracy theorists

5089.32 --> 5095.5599999999995
and then they probably live longer if

5092.26 --> 5097.6
they can overcome the early stress

5095.56 --> 5101.1
anxiety phase

5097.6 --> 5101.1
of the Awakening of that

5120.699 --> 5123.699
anyway

5124.42 --> 5127.86
I mean at least you're tried

5138.659 --> 5143.5
but anyway yeah Lennox look the test is

5142.06 --> 5145.719
also

5143.5 --> 5148.36
it is kind of a I do it for social

5145.719 --> 5150.34
status effect not because I get that

5148.36 --> 5153.28
officially but

5150.34 --> 5156.34
since I wear Tash there's no more like

5153.28 --> 5160.179
guys that are like calling me young men

5156.34 --> 5162.1
right because that's kind of annoying

5160.179 --> 5164.4400000000005
because there's like men out there that

5162.1 --> 5168.900000000001
are like bigger or they have like

5164.44 --> 5168.9
they're just more manly in ways

5169.3 --> 5173.860000000001
or like older men and they really think

5172.06 --> 5175.659000000001
of me as a young man even though I'm

5173.86 --> 5178.12
like yeah but I'm not that young really

5175.659 --> 5179.98
anymore I mean that was cute when I was

5178.12 --> 5183.42
20 it was still kind of cute when it was

5179.98 --> 5183.419999999999
30 but now it's like uh

5184.12 --> 5192.36
I'm actually a lot wiser

5187.659 --> 5192.36
than how young I look right

5227.139 --> 5232.78
right but yeah let us say it's Bluefield

5230.08 --> 5233.86
Evolution I've had those moments

5232.78 --> 5236.139
like

5233.86 --> 5239.44
I did that sort of thing with well my

5236.139 --> 5243.04
Gamers from my d d group

5239.44 --> 5244.599999999999
I've tried to awaken them in multiple

5243.04 --> 5247.719
occasions

5244.6 --> 5248.860000000001
like one of the guys who often gave me a

5247.719 --> 5251.139
lift

5248.86 --> 5253.36
was

5251.139 --> 5257.5
pretty cool with it

5253.36 --> 5260.139
was a like a nurse man but he is like

5257.5 --> 5262.679
really nice and

5260.139 --> 5264.88
he wouldn't have any kind of like

5262.679 --> 5267.58
psychological responses or anything

5264.88 --> 5269.32
against Flat Earth so he fully knew that

5267.58 --> 5271.42
I was into that

5269.32 --> 5274.179
and he would just let me talk and not

5271.42 --> 5276.1
get interrupted or anything

5274.179 --> 5277.6
asked a couple of questions but he just

5276.1 --> 5279.400000000001
didn't really want to dig into it

5277.6 --> 5282.820000000001
personally too much

5279.4 --> 5285.5199999999995
other Gamers were like no no twitchable

5282.82 --> 5288.639
it's a ball they would literally go like

5285.52 --> 5290.7390000000005
white eyes as a ball they lit do that

5288.639 --> 5292.4800000000005
it's so weird

5290.739 --> 5295.9
when you bring it up they're like no

5292.48 --> 5299.159
it's a ball like that like what the [ __ ]

5295.9 --> 5299.159
is up with that guy

5305.62 --> 5308.159
right

5308.58 --> 5316.0
yeah some people just get really weird

5313.42 --> 5319.56
with flat Earth the guy was just a real

5316.0 --> 5322.36
big fan of balls the Spheres I guess

5319.56 --> 5325.6
like even in my d game there were like

5322.36 --> 5327.48
these magical spheres things that were

5325.6 --> 5329.8
like artifacts

5327.48 --> 5331.0
mystery and they'd turn out to be like

5329.8 --> 5333.76
keys

5331.0 --> 5336.58
to like extra Dimensional Doors

5333.76 --> 5338.320000000001
and he loved that he was like oh yeah

5336.58 --> 5340.42
the beautiful sphere how does it look

5338.32 --> 5344.679
like is there anything special about it

5340.42 --> 5347.679
like like okay that guy's really into

5344.679 --> 5347.679
heliocentrism

5350.2 --> 5354.34
[Music]

5352.239 --> 5356.98
that was weird

5354.34 --> 5359.9800000000005
you would never get patronizing though

5356.98 --> 5361.239
it was like not in his character it's

5359.98 --> 5364.36
Swedish

5361.239 --> 5366.218999999999
it's like not patronizing ever

5364.36 --> 5369.099999999999
you just wouldn't do that

5366.219 --> 5372.219
only like in character as part of an act

5369.1 --> 5373.620000000001
but never in person ever was very nice

5372.219 --> 5375.76
guy

5373.62 --> 5378.179
yeah he's still out there I saw him

5375.76 --> 5378.179
recently

5386.02 --> 5390.6990000000005
you know wide-eyed Ballers yeah but it's

5388.179 --> 5392.02
really it's so weird it's like you're

5390.699 --> 5394.48
having a conversation you're like yeah

5392.02 --> 5396.88
but if you really look into the data you

5394.48 --> 5401.5199999999995
know there's the Horizon and he was like

5396.88 --> 5403.5
no it's a ball it's a ball

5401.52 --> 5407.679
okay

5403.5 --> 5410.4
okie dokie I'll stop talking about this

5407.679 --> 5410.4
now I guess

5421.0 --> 5425.46
but he had a really bizarre reaction to

5423.34 --> 5425.46
it

5426.64 --> 5433.02
[Music]

5433.06 --> 5436.900000000001
all right

5434.739 --> 5439.299999999999
I'm a great storyteller

5436.9 --> 5441.5199999999995
maybe sometimes

5439.3 --> 5445.4400000000005
when I'm trying to convey weird things

5441.52 --> 5445.4400000000005
that happened in my experience yeah

5445.6 --> 5450.3
but there was this was just so funny

5451.54 --> 5456.1
although in that moment it wasn't kind

5453.699 --> 5458.08
of frustrating because I was really I

5456.1 --> 5460.719
really hope that I could just get the

5458.08 --> 5464.62
entire group to be flat Earth so I could

5460.719 --> 5467.32
graft it in the D and D more and make it

5464.62 --> 5470.8
part make I wanted to make them curious

5467.32 --> 5473.679
to exploration

5470.8 --> 5475.96
I I want I even had an idea of like

5473.679 --> 5478.42
planting a dichotomy where there would

5475.96 --> 5481.36
be a ball earth religion in the game

5478.42 --> 5485.62
that was being unrolled

5481.36 --> 5488.259999999999
while it was actually flat and well in

5485.62 --> 5491.32
the game that same guy I just mentioned

5488.26 --> 5494.56
there was a wide-eyed it's a ball like

5491.32 --> 5497.259999999999
he in the game his character was a Bard

5494.56 --> 5501.719
a Bard halfling who was convinced the

5497.26 --> 5501.719
Earth was a ball he insisted on that

5502.179 --> 5508.9
it's like it's a weird situation

5505.06 --> 5510.52
sometimes with with the gamers out there

5508.9 --> 5512.62
but

5510.52 --> 5515.8
yeah I mean

5512.62 --> 5518.26
then the whole covet [ __ ] broke out and

5515.8 --> 5521.860000000001
they and they go oh we're gonna do so

5518.26 --> 5523.6
like oh we we have to uh we can't do the

5521.86 --> 5525.82
game anymore because we have to stay

5523.6 --> 5529.42
indoors or we write risk

5525.82 --> 5532.179
gang Kobe literally it's like

5529.42 --> 5534.4
wow

5532.179 --> 5535.4800000000005
so that's the end of the group then I

5534.4 --> 5537.82
guess

5535.48 --> 5540.159
[ __ ]

5537.82 --> 5543.5199999999995
that's years ago now

5540.159 --> 5546.599999999999
I'm really like yeah

5543.52 --> 5546.6
I kind of miss him

5550.12 --> 5553.48
but maybe there's also been just a

5552.04 --> 5555.659
little bit too much friction here and

5553.48 --> 5555.659
there

5556.12 --> 5561.82
I mean I like I tried to warn them even

5558.82 --> 5564.58
about like yeah

5561.82 --> 5566.08
that thing that they say everybody's

5564.58 --> 5568.78
gotta take

5566.08 --> 5571.659
that's freaking lethal it's gonna

5568.78 --> 5575.199
literally mutilate you

5571.659 --> 5577.299999999999
potentially kill you you please don't do

5575.199 --> 5579.339999999999
it literally like

5577.3 --> 5581.92
looking them in the eyes and literally

5579.34 --> 5583.84
like please I beg of you don't do that

5581.92 --> 5587.1990000000005
please

5583.84 --> 5591.06
very urgently and I think that that

5587.199 --> 5591.0599999999995
really kind of freaked them out

5593.04 --> 5599.44
they really didn't believe me and so I

5597.219 --> 5602.9800000000005
have a suspicion that one of them might

5599.44 --> 5605.62
be dead now because of it

5602.98 --> 5608.678999999999
I'm not sure though

5605.62 --> 5612.0599999999995
because she so she was really like yeah

5608.679 --> 5612.06
I'm gonna take it I'm Gonna Take It

5620.62 --> 5625.179
I've tried streaming games yeah

5625.239 --> 5630.759999999999
yeah I could do that but that's boring

5628.0 --> 5634.08
that's literally boring

5630.76 --> 5634.08
I don't want that

5653.92 --> 5660.9400000000005
I mean I'd just be playing old games

5659.02 --> 5662.92
and I don't know if it would be super

5660.94 --> 5666.299999999999
amusing even

5662.92 --> 5666.3
to watch that

5683.26 --> 5686.820000000001
what about the satellite

5701.08 --> 5706.3
hmm condemnation without investigation

5704.26 --> 5710.159000000001
is indoctrination

5706.3 --> 5710.159000000001
it's an interesting one yeah

5711.88 --> 5717.4800000000005
that would make a great t-shirt for like

5714.28 --> 5717.48
at protests too

5720.28 --> 5725.759999999999
seriously since that's that would make a

5722.679 --> 5725.76
great protest t-shirt

5735.9 --> 5741.339999999999
and how do you know it was Chinese

5738.28 --> 5744.599999999999
because the China government officially

5741.34 --> 5744.6
claimed it to be

5751.36 --> 5757.54
but maybe they took on the blame

5754.96 --> 5759.94
right I mean it could literally just be

5757.54 --> 5763.719
a us set balloon

5759.94 --> 5765.879999999999
that has a an altitude uh like heater

5763.719 --> 5769.12
because they use heaters to keep the

5765.88 --> 5771.1
balloon up there at times and maybe it

5769.12 --> 5773.38
malfunctioned so it just started to

5771.1 --> 5776.139
drift more and more down

5773.38 --> 5778.3
it could be a us balloon and they're

5776.139 --> 5780.219
just saying it's Chinese

5778.3 --> 5781.4800000000005
because maybe they want to start a

5780.219 --> 5783.34
poking game

5781.48 --> 5785.199
right because maybe they want to start

5783.34 --> 5788.62
World War III

5785.199 --> 5790.36
because world wars only happen when all

5788.62 --> 5792.82
parties agree to it and then start

5790.36 --> 5795.5199999999995
building a narrative of how the war

5792.82 --> 5798.28
starts that's actually how a world war

5795.52 --> 5800.1990000000005
starts is when both parties agree that

5798.28 --> 5803.739
they should start building a narrative

5800.199 --> 5805.82
on how the world war starts yeah

5803.739 --> 5807.159
so it could be that

5805.82 --> 5811.78
[Music]

5807.159 --> 5814.44
or it's just a useless distraction while

5811.78 --> 5814.44
yeah

5814.6 --> 5821.6990000000005
well just [ __ ] goes wrong and

5818.98 --> 5821.699
I don't know

5823.9 --> 5829.239
a false flag yeah but that seeking star

5827.08 --> 5831.5199999999995
what that makes no sense because China

5829.239 --> 5834.04
is not denying its their balloon they

5831.52 --> 5836.8
claim it is their balloon

5834.04 --> 5840.82
makes no sense like a false flag isn't a

5836.8 --> 5844.78
false flag when the party that is

5840.82 --> 5846.88
faked to be the cause of the event says

5844.78 --> 5850.739
we are the cause of the event that it is

5846.88 --> 5850.7390000000005
not a false flag that makes no sense

5854.199 --> 5857.199
foreign

5862.42 --> 5866.82
would be a false flag if China says what

5864.94 --> 5868.78
the hell are you talking about that

5866.82 --> 5870.82
your balloon

5868.78 --> 5872.62
and then [ __ ] happens yeah then it would

5870.82 --> 5874.599999999999
be a false flag but they literally said

5872.62 --> 5876.94
no it's our balloon

5874.6 --> 5880.360000000001
sorry about that

5876.94 --> 5882.82
oh why did you shoot on a balloon oh

5880.36 --> 5886.92
right I mean can't be a false flag then

5882.82 --> 5886.92
because they literally claim it's theirs

5887.44 --> 5891.699
thank you

5888.28 --> 5893.199
the whole point of a false flag event is

5891.699 --> 5895.839999999999
that

5893.199 --> 5897.5199999999995
like you do it yourself and then claim

5895.84 --> 5899.08
it's the opponent the opponent is not

5897.52 --> 5901.06
gonna go along with it because they know

5899.08 --> 5902.92
it's not them

5901.06 --> 5904.659000000001
they do go along with it well then it

5902.92 --> 5908.46
can't be a false flag

5904.659 --> 5908.46
then it's just a conspiracy

5909.219 --> 5915.9
or a useless event that's being way over

5912.1 --> 5915.900000000001
hyped it could be that too

5918.219 --> 5920.4
foreign

5921.28 --> 5926.639
what's that accent

5923.8 --> 5926.639
what do you mean

5929.5 --> 5934.5
what are you talking about let's go

5931.96 --> 5934.5
homeopath

5940.54 --> 5943.9
but I hope you guys are all enjoying the

5942.699 --> 5948.219
show

5943.9 --> 5948.219
maybe I should have a title revisit

5948.699 --> 5954.9
because I'm literally not talking about

5951.48 --> 5954.9
presuppositions at all

5955.36 --> 5959.92
oh the Chinese accent

5957.94 --> 5963.159
it's a little racist I don't give a [ __ ]

5959.92 --> 5966.34
I have Chinese blood I can be Chinese I

5963.159 --> 5969.58
can be Chinese racist because I Chinese

5966.34 --> 5972.219
I mean it's just 1 16th but

5969.58 --> 5975.1
screw that

5972.219 --> 5979.8
I can be Chinese when I want

5975.1 --> 5979.8
I might we be Chinese when we want okay

5984.76 --> 5986.88
okay

6004.86 --> 6009.299999999999
besides there's a lot of Chinese when

6007.26 --> 6011.219
they speak English they actually do talk

6009.3 --> 6014.96
like that I'm not trying to make them

6011.219 --> 6014.96
look silly even when I do that

6016.44 --> 6021.48
thank you

6017.58 --> 6024.679
it's talking like an is talking like an

6021.48 --> 6024.678999999999
Englishman racist

6025.5 --> 6030.36
why are you culturally appropriating my

6028.44 --> 6033.259999999999
accent sir

6030.36 --> 6035.94
like but isn't that what you wanted

6033.26 --> 6038.88
isn't that the foundation of the British

6035.94 --> 6041.299999999999
Empire is to actually spread the British

6038.88 --> 6041.3
culture

6064.92 --> 6070.1990000000005
right but I mean I've nothing against

6068.219 --> 6073.139
Chinese people

6070.199 --> 6075.36
I think that like actual well-spoken

6073.139 --> 6076.8
Chinese is really fascinating sounding

6075.36 --> 6078.92
it's so

6076.8 --> 6081.3
New York yeah

6078.92 --> 6083.4
they can't do it properly it's just that

6081.3 --> 6085.320000000001
they have this weird sound Play It's

6083.4 --> 6087.0
really fascinating to me just how

6085.32 --> 6089.28
Chinese people

6087.0 --> 6092.04
speak when they really

6089.28 --> 6095.82
like do High Chinese it's really

6092.04 --> 6098.159
interesting and like musical I was

6095.82 --> 6101.28
how are you only won 16's age another

6098.159 --> 6104.759999999999
one six no I'm mixed I'm not just China

6101.28 --> 6108.98
I'm Indonesian Chinese

6104.76 --> 6108.9800000000005
and German and Dutch and Belgium

6109.8 --> 6113.219
and maybe some other things that are not

6111.719 --> 6116.06
really registered

6113.219 --> 6116.06
I'm not sure

6118.02 --> 6124.92
but I'm like at 1 8

6120.719 --> 6127.7390000000005
Indonesian 1 16 Chinese I mean I come

6124.92 --> 6131.96
from a long line a generation of weird

6127.739 --> 6131.959999999999
cross breeding I don't know why

6134.06 --> 6137.820000000001
I don't know why

6136.08 --> 6140.82
but they all seem to have been doing

6137.82 --> 6143.94
that like even my grandfather wasn't

6140.82 --> 6145.139
just a pure blood or well like pure

6143.94 --> 6148.379999999999
blood

6145.139 --> 6150.36
a pure one

6148.38 --> 6153.84
root

6150.36 --> 6156.92
he was like German

6153.84 --> 6156.92
and Chinese

6157.139 --> 6166.26
and then my grandmother with him was

6160.679 --> 6170.0
actually for Indonesian and like new

6166.26 --> 6170.0
it's all kinds of weird [ __ ]

6175.739 --> 6178.638999999999
why did I

6182.82 --> 6188.82
no wait no other way around

6187.02 --> 6192.119000000001
oh God

6188.82 --> 6195.599999999999
it's it's all over the place but it's

6192.119 --> 6197.339999999999
roughly just German

6195.6 --> 6199.320000000001
like the Belgium is more from my

6197.34 --> 6202.52
mother's side I think but I'm not

6199.32 --> 6206.28
entirely sure but it's like German

6202.52 --> 6209.119000000001
Indonesian Belgium but still very much

6206.28 --> 6209.119
mostly Dutch

6214.5 --> 6218.48
so I'm a hybrid yeah quite a bit

6221.82 --> 6229.759999999999
you could say I'm like

6225.08 --> 6229.76
a fourth generation

6230.96 --> 6238.08
European or Germanic

6235.08 --> 6238.08
Indo

6240.0 --> 6244.56
because yeah I mean the Netherlands

6242.34 --> 6247.619000000001
Germany it's it's really kind of the

6244.56 --> 6250.619000000001
same gene group in many ways

6247.619 --> 6254.119
so that's kind of what I am

6250.619 --> 6254.119
yeah I don't know

6277.139 --> 6282.56
all right and I think that my

6279.179 --> 6286.56
grandfather was actually three quarters

6282.56 --> 6289.4400000000005
Indonesian and quarter Chinese

6286.56 --> 6293.0
my grandmother was

6289.44 --> 6293.0
Dutch with

6295.199 --> 6300.36
dude I'd have to ask my dad again

6298.08 --> 6302.46
I I

6300.36 --> 6304.44
know roughly where it's coming from but

6302.46 --> 6307.679
I can't just like oh this person is that

6304.44 --> 6310.259999999999
percentage that I should have there is a

6307.679 --> 6312.179
lineage that has been lineage research

6310.26 --> 6314.76
done though from especially from that

6312.179 --> 6316.92
side of the family so

6314.76 --> 6319.38
the information is known I just don't

6316.92 --> 6321.7390000000005
know it by heart I'm just nowhere

6319.38 --> 6321.7390000000005
roughly

6324.06 --> 6329.84
but all the

6326.34 --> 6333.3
German Indonesian and

6329.84 --> 6335.84
Chinese is all coming from my dad's side

6333.3 --> 6335.84
of the family

6336.0 --> 6341.82
the Dutch and the Belgium and arguably

6338.76 --> 6343.92
some Jew here and there or something

6341.82 --> 6346.94
or like

6343.92 --> 6346.9400000000005
from my mother's side

6347.219 --> 6351.679
now when you grow no no negro

6355.619 --> 6362.159
I'm very much not negro not even

6358.619 --> 6364.199
remotely not Italian right because the

6362.159 --> 6366.36
south of that is very mixed in none of

6364.199 --> 6369.0
that

6366.36 --> 6371.96
it's really Chinese it's more yeah an

6369.0 --> 6371.96
Asian European

6380.58 --> 6385.8
interesting family tree you have yeah

6382.98 --> 6387.839999999999
relatively I mean they're people in my

6385.8 --> 6389.219
family are pretty interesting cool

6387.84 --> 6391.4400000000005
people

6389.219 --> 6394.32
some of them have issues but we don't

6391.44 --> 6395.879999999999
have like real serious degenerates that

6394.32 --> 6399.96
are like

6395.88 --> 6401.82
like criminals or anti-socials

6399.96 --> 6404.219
I mean they might be like rough around

6401.82 --> 6406.98
the edges a bit or like not easy with

6404.219 --> 6409.5
social interaction but none of them are

6406.98 --> 6411.239
like real criminals

6409.5 --> 6413.34
or

6411.239 --> 6417.599999999999
like

6413.34 --> 6420.619000000001
gay even I don't think we have any gays

6417.6 --> 6420.619000000001
on my dad's side

6423.719 --> 6428.159
which is like a real Relief by the way

6425.639 --> 6431.06
that that's like it like give me more of

6428.159 --> 6431.0599999999995
those genes thanks

6436.38 --> 6441.6
[ __ ]

6438.42 --> 6443.82
bootstrap filter what the hell is that I

6441.6 --> 6446.719
don't know what that means dude

6443.82 --> 6446.719
Leah Brown

6463.56 --> 6469.679
is a pirate

6466.26 --> 6471.659000000001
well my dad's never been a pirate

6469.679 --> 6474.84
although he had a time where he did

6471.659 --> 6476.099999999999
really like knives and [ __ ]

6474.84 --> 6479.28
but

6476.1 --> 6480.780000000001
that's like Indonesian too typical

6479.28 --> 6482.759999999999
I guess

6480.78 --> 6484.739
or maybe Germanic there's probably in

6482.76 --> 6486.96
Germans that like that [ __ ] too and

6484.739 --> 6489.299999999999
knives on the wall and all that he was

6486.96 --> 6490.92
into that a bit

6489.3 --> 6494.06
but

6490.92 --> 6497.76
I mean he's definitely no pirate he's

6494.06 --> 6499.38
very much not criminal like he doesn't

6497.76 --> 6502.139
even have

6499.38 --> 6504.92
the impulse to like be dominant in any

6502.139 --> 6504.92
way like that

6511.199 --> 6516.54
he is pretty talented at keeping women

6513.96 --> 6520.04
entertained though that is one

6516.54 --> 6520.04
particular Talent he does have

6520.86 --> 6526.5599999999995
and meant too but women is like really

6523.619 --> 6529.88
good at entertaining them

6526.56 --> 6529.88
just has this thing

6531.659 --> 6535.4
he's very gracious with him

6546.719 --> 6551.719
lots of pirates were Welsh okay

6554.58 --> 6560.34
Pirates of the Caribbean

6556.8 --> 6562.52
that's funny like one of uh my dad's

6560.34 --> 6566.76
Brothers is actually married to somebody

6562.52 --> 6569.780000000001
it's like a real a real black lady from

6566.76 --> 6569.780000000001
the Caribbean I think

6571.26 --> 6575.54
or could it also be from uh

6575.94 --> 6581.54
The Colony from Suriname I'm not sure

6578.4 --> 6581.54
either one of those

6583.8 --> 6588.139
what's just that one brother

6592.32 --> 6595.639
it's all white

6595.699 --> 6598.82
all right

6605.76 --> 6610.820000000001
you look like a Orlando Bloom yeah I've

6607.98 --> 6610.82
heard that one before

6627.179 --> 6632.0
okay funny letter Sage

6635.34 --> 6639.0
ah

6636.9 --> 6640.679
flatten the curve that's so [ __ ] up

6639.0 --> 6643.44
when that happens

6640.679 --> 6645.9
you're like oh yeah that's some just

6643.44 --> 6648.599999999999
trashing shooting of zombies and then

6645.9 --> 6651.9
it's freaking gaming oh God

6648.6 --> 6654.08
of course of course was it on Netflix or

6651.9 --> 6654.08
something

6655.44 --> 6660.719
because they really like to do that

6658.56 --> 6662.88
they even have a system for that did you

6660.719 --> 6665.78
know that

6662.88 --> 6665.78
typically

6665.94 --> 6671.159
oh okay

6668.639 --> 6673.54
that's not related to the uh

6671.159 --> 6676.739
the show you're watching

6673.54 --> 6676.739
[Music]

6684.3 --> 6691.1
don't Pirates have a code it's more like

6686.4 --> 6691.099999999999
guidelines really I like that one too

6700.199 --> 6704.879999999999
thank you

6702.0 --> 6706.739
The Last of Us oh yeah I'm definitely

6704.88 --> 6709.32
not gonna watch that

6706.739 --> 6712.159
dude there's so much crap

6709.32 --> 6712.159
on Netflix

6713.04 --> 6720.179
and they always have like

6715.86 --> 6723.0
a thing where in the third Act

6720.179 --> 6726.119
they throw gay at you

6723.0 --> 6729.0
it's like all these series or the third

6726.119 --> 6732.42
act no it's not the ACT it's like in the

6729.0 --> 6735.0
series you have like series from 8 to 12

6732.42 --> 6737.04
episodes or something and it's always at

6735.0 --> 6739.8
the fourth show

6737.04 --> 6742.38
for some reason where they really do

6739.8 --> 6744.78
something really [ __ ] disgusting gay

6742.38 --> 6746.219
in the open like open gay sex and [ __ ]

6744.78 --> 6749.699
like

6746.219 --> 6751.679
and kissing they do it all these series

6749.699 --> 6753.54
and they think it's like oh this is

6751.679 --> 6758.06
awesome and then it's like oh yeah and

6753.54 --> 6763.219
then the fourth episode oh gay

6758.06 --> 6763.219
every [ __ ] time that fourth episode

6768.06 --> 6772.02
just

6769.26 --> 6773.639
just watch it right you watch yourself

6772.02 --> 6775.38
every time you're gonna break a Netflix

6773.639 --> 6778.38
series open

6775.38 --> 6780.6
just be wary like yeah the first three

6778.38 --> 6784.619
episodes might be really good

6780.6 --> 6786.360000000001
and then expect some serious gay [ __ ] to

6784.619 --> 6787.679
be thrown at you

6786.36 --> 6789.659
cause

6787.679 --> 6792.679
they do that a lot

6789.659 --> 6792.679
with the new series

6799.08 --> 6803.82
adaptations right

6801.54 --> 6807.679
I don't care

6803.82 --> 6807.679
I'm not interested in that at all

6808.86 --> 6815.96
I'm more interested in old stuff

6812.46 --> 6815.96
actually had a freaking point

6832.199 --> 6835.219
oh my God

6836.82 --> 6839.82
ah

6841.92 --> 6847.4400000000005
that's almost too much information Lea

6844.739 --> 6849.36
Brown that's so [ __ ] gross I don't

6847.44 --> 6852.259999999999
I kind of want to forget that you just

6849.36 --> 6852.259999999999
said that thanks

6852.42 --> 6855.38
right but

6855.78 --> 6862.38
it's does what they do

6858.719 --> 6863.94
freaking gay [ __ ] usually series oh and

6862.38 --> 6865.8
then the fourth episode in oh guess

6863.94 --> 6868.739
what's gonna happen

6865.8 --> 6872.84
guess what's gonna happen

6868.739 --> 6872.839999999999
something really really gay

6873.06 --> 6876.96
just check it out just start paying

6875.699 --> 6881.04
attention like oh you're gonna check

6876.96 --> 6883.44
something out like remember this

6881.04 --> 6885.36
I'm not the first one to say this I

6883.44 --> 6888.0
actually kind of got this through Owen

6885.36 --> 6890.099999999999
Benjamin well I did actually figure it

6888.0 --> 6892.619
out kind of myself but he right kind of

6890.1 --> 6895.38
pointed at it like yeah this is really a

6892.619 --> 6897.659
thing so it is really a thing fourth

6895.38 --> 6900.179
episode the Netflix series are usually

6897.659 --> 6902.94
really freaking gay

6900.179 --> 6904.08
so check that out see if that's actually

6902.94 --> 6906.96
true

6904.08 --> 6909.6
and then if it is true well then you can

6906.96 --> 6911.58
basically prepare yourself and not be oh

6909.6 --> 6914.96
my God it's gay again yeah because

6911.58 --> 6914.96
probably it's the fourth episode

6916.98 --> 6922.678999999999
so pay attention

6919.8 --> 6925.56
let's see if that it really is the way

6922.679 --> 6927.54
it works that is a consistent thing they

6925.56 --> 6930.119000000001
do

6927.54 --> 6932.659
and then get back at me with it

6930.119 --> 6932.659
right

6932.76 --> 6938.88
yeah Nature Boy piss off don't do that I

6937.139 --> 6942.06

6964.38 --> 6969.119
Benjamin's input
