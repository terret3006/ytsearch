83.84 --> 86.72
appreciate it

85.119 --> 89.52
thank you very much it's like a big vote

86.72 --> 92.88
of confidence so

89.52 --> 95.52
right let's see the weather today is

92.88 --> 96.96
quite beautiful although i thought it

95.52 --> 99.6
was going to be a little

96.96 --> 102.0
cold but then the sun came through it's

99.6 --> 103.83999999999999
been very windy all day

102.0 --> 105.84
and yeah i think there's probably been

103.84 --> 109.36
some chemtrails earlier

105.84 --> 111.28
from the looks of it but the wind has

109.36 --> 114.399
already dispersed it a lot

111.28 --> 115.6
and that's just all these big clouds

114.399 --> 118.0
hanging around

115.6 --> 120.479
in between well clear skies somewhat

118.0 --> 120.479
covered up

120.799 --> 129.84
and despite that still very sunny

124.64 --> 129.84
very much middle of summer

130.479 --> 134.72000000000003
but the wind is just constantly blowing

134.8 --> 141.04000000000002
right so

137.92 --> 142.72
let's see who's in chat for that i got a

141.04 --> 146.07999999999998
green tea with me

142.72 --> 148.959
and grapefruit juice i really thought

146.08 --> 148.959
that was a good idea

150.959 --> 159.2
ah not too cold

155.36 --> 161.20000000000002
that's the best way uh

159.2 --> 163.11999999999998
right so yeah everybody was a bit late i

161.2 --> 165.04
don't know why but good servant was

163.12 --> 167.12
first

165.04 --> 170.4
and then everybody came leaking in five

167.12 --> 174.08
minutes before

170.4 --> 184.959
bandit over mccool peter harrington

174.08 --> 187.84
roger here we go again

184.959 --> 187.84
robin stanley

188.319 --> 195.44
tom parker yeah good to see you all

192.239 --> 199.84
i missed anyone right yeah

195.44 --> 199.84
it's tuesday

202.239 --> 207.36
ah yeah

205.599 --> 209.76
well here we go again if you have a big

207.36 --> 211.12
sunflower it's getting really big

209.76 --> 214.07999999999998
then you have to make sure it's

211.12 --> 219.12
supported because yeah they do blow down

214.08 --> 219.12
that's right sorry to hear that

224.84 --> 230.48
anyway had a very

227.12 --> 231.20000000000002
late night last night stayed up mostly

230.48 --> 233.2
due to

231.2 --> 241.599
gaming i was just i don't know i was in

233.2 --> 245.2
a gaming mood

241.599 --> 247.76
right yeah yesterday's flutter's debate

245.2 --> 247.76
was good

248.48 --> 250.72
uh

251.599 --> 256.0
yeah i'm having a lot of fun these days

254.4 --> 258.959
basically entering

256.0 --> 260.799
an argument as a baller it's like it's

258.959 --> 263.04
kind of weird because

260.799 --> 265.28
like a half a year ago even i would do

263.04 --> 265.28000000000003
that

265.6 --> 270.16
and then people would get a little bit

267.199 --> 272.0
confused because i guess that

270.16 --> 273.84000000000003
my arguments were pretty clear and

272.0 --> 276.639
that's like confusing

273.84 --> 277.67999999999995
but now they really get what i'm doing

276.639 --> 279.84000000000003
and yeah

277.68 --> 281.04
i'm having fun in the flat earth debates

279.84 --> 283.19899999999996
these days because of that

281.04 --> 284.88
because i could just say like okay i'm

283.199 --> 288.0
going to approach it like a baller now

284.88 --> 289.36
like a baller like me like how i used to

288.0 --> 292.639
be a baller

289.36 --> 292.639
and it's fun doing that

297.36 --> 301.52000000000004
but yeah it was pretty intense day

299.28 --> 302.79999999999995
overall uh after flattered debate i

301.52 --> 306.15999999999997
called my healer

302.8 --> 307.44
because i didn't need that because of

306.16 --> 310.47900000000004
the what has happened

307.44 --> 313.199
like well before that

310.479 --> 314.08
a lot of there was a lot of like dark

313.199 --> 317.44
influence

314.08 --> 320.71999999999997
bubbling up and trying to get

317.44 --> 322.479
to me through others it's typically how

320.72 --> 324.0
it happens it's like there's a call of

322.479 --> 326.32
iron and suddenly

324.0 --> 327.68
that call arrives in different people

326.32 --> 329.59999999999997
that are kind of like

327.68 --> 332.639
already slightly connected to me and

329.6 --> 335.52000000000004
they get drawn to me

332.639 --> 336.32
and that's what happens literally it's

335.52 --> 339.28
literally

336.32 --> 340.32
what happens there's people out there

339.28 --> 342.71999999999997
some of them i've met

340.32 --> 344.15999999999997
they have arimon in them and it's not

342.72 --> 346.639
coming out

344.16 --> 349.759
and yes so a lot of the time they're

346.639 --> 351.36
just doing whatever

349.759 --> 353.6
and then suddenly the call comes and

351.36 --> 356.56
then they get all nutty

353.6 --> 358.40000000000003
and trollish or whatever and they try to

356.56 --> 361.199
get to people

358.4 --> 361.52
and in this case me because the call i

361.199 --> 366.24
guess

361.52 --> 368.479
came from inside of me was not good

366.24 --> 368.479
uh

369.44 --> 373.68
or yeah i was vulnerable to it so i

371.44 --> 375.759
called my healer and he cleared that up

373.68 --> 377.919
and he had even a compliment for me that

375.759 --> 381.12
was very interesting because i had

377.919 --> 384.0
so much stuff

381.12 --> 385.84000000000003
yeah it's hard to explain like things

384.0 --> 387.84
ethereal connections it's

385.84 --> 389.039
it's again it's hard to explain it's

387.84 --> 390.84999999999997
like consequences

389.039 --> 392.15999999999997
junk

390.85 --> 395.44
[Music]

392.16 --> 398.40000000000003
even like false suggestion

395.44 --> 399.199
feeling remnants that are not mine that

398.4 --> 401.44
are literally

399.199 --> 403.28000000000003
piled on by these entities it because

401.44 --> 406.319
they are technically

403.28 --> 408.31899999999996
entities through others it's

406.319 --> 409.36
it's yeah it's get it gets a little

408.319 --> 412.56
ethereal

409.36 --> 415.759
it even gets a little ethereal to me but

412.56 --> 416.16
yeah the man is really good at what he

415.759 --> 418.40000000000003
does

416.16 --> 419.36
he's been doing it for most of his life

418.4 --> 422.79999999999995
and

419.36 --> 426.08000000000004
yeah i i trust him because i have felt

422.8 --> 429.28000000000003
the results and he

426.08 --> 430.08
knows perfectly how to basically latch

429.28 --> 432.79999999999995
onto

430.08 --> 434.96
my ethereal intuition that i kind of try

432.8 --> 437.52000000000004
to use on my show and everything

434.96 --> 439.19899999999996
he can latch on we can almost

437.52 --> 442.71999999999997
telepathically interface

439.199 --> 446.0
we still need words to support to nudge

442.72 --> 447.91900000000004
but we very quickly get of one another

446.0 --> 450.24
what we're talking about even if with

447.919 --> 454.15999999999997
half sentences

450.24 --> 458.0
very quickly and yeah he's explained

454.16 --> 460.08000000000004
how it works and he's cleared it up

458.0 --> 464.56
with permission of god by the way of

460.08 --> 466.639
christ is always in the name of christ

464.56 --> 467.68
through the methodology of rodol steiner

466.639 --> 470.72
and all that

467.68 --> 474.479
and yeah that that did a lot of good

470.72 --> 474.47900000000004
that helped me a lot cleared me up

476.639 --> 482.639
all right and yeah

479.84 --> 484.479
after that pretty much yeah what most

482.639 --> 486.479
would consider like my bad luck stroke

484.479 --> 488.31899999999996
it kind of turned around

486.479 --> 490.15999999999997
because i had other little weird things

488.319 --> 492.319
that i hadn't even mentioned

490.16 --> 493.36
like i had a wine bottle and when i took

492.319 --> 496.08000000000004
it out of the bag

493.36 --> 498.319
the the neck just broke off just like

496.08 --> 500.479
that apparently bumped it

498.319 --> 502.72
too hard at something at some point but

500.479 --> 505.52
that's never happened before it's like

502.72 --> 507.36
very weird to it really does feel like

505.52 --> 509.44
bad luck and i managed to save most of

507.36 --> 511.599
it by pouring it over into an old bottle

509.44 --> 513.68
that i cleaned up

511.599 --> 516.959
but that was just off and there were

513.68 --> 516.959
other things tied into it

517.279 --> 521.599
maybe i did mention this yesterday i

518.959 --> 523.279
don't remember

521.599 --> 524.72
i should remember because i didn't watch

523.279 --> 527.6
it back entirely

524.72 --> 529.839
right anyway uh yeah own benjamin was

527.6 --> 533.44
live again

529.839 --> 536.8000000000001
that was interesting oh after that point

533.44 --> 536.8000000000001
i kind of stopped making notes

537.12 --> 539.44
uh

543.519 --> 548.24
no wait there was other stuff what was

546.839 --> 550.8000000000001
it

548.24 --> 552.48
there was something else that i watched

550.8 --> 554.56
there were a whole bunch of videos i

552.48 --> 556.9590000000001
don't understand why i forgot making

554.56 --> 560.8389999999999
notes about it

556.959 --> 564.0799999999999
maybe it was because of the release

560.839 --> 566.0
from from the aramanian influences that

564.08 --> 567.12
i just felt so free that i kind of

566.0 --> 570.48
forgot about

567.12 --> 573.6
yeah my earthly plans of making notes

570.48 --> 574.48
that's probably it uh but i still did a

573.6 --> 576.64
lot because i

574.48 --> 580.08
pretty much stayed up until four o'clock

576.64 --> 584.24
which is just crazy for my doing

580.08 --> 584.24
and gamed in all kinds of directions

584.959 --> 587.1999999999999
uh

588.32 --> 591.6800000000001
it was kind of fun because i i had back

590.88 --> 594.08
some joy

591.68 --> 596.8
over these games and that's always good

594.08 --> 596.8000000000001
to experience

597.12 --> 600.24
hey julia pavin

601.04 --> 604.64
this time of unusually aggressive

602.8 --> 606.8
attacks by evil be vigilant brothers and

604.64 --> 610.88
sisters yes robin stanley

606.8 --> 613.1999999999999
yeah and again it was private but i want

610.88 --> 616.56
to apologize for what happened yesterday

613.2 --> 619.279
after the show because i didn't

616.56 --> 620.8
i didn't break anything on the show but

619.279 --> 624.399
some things that happened i don't know

620.8 --> 629.279
how many people caught on to that

624.399 --> 631.12
and i was really pissed off

629.279 --> 633.279
glad i didn't pour that out on the show

631.12 --> 636.72
but kind of robin stanley got the full

633.279 --> 638.32
blow of it and that's it wasn't hers it

636.72 --> 640.9590000000001
wasn't

638.32 --> 641.44
it wasn't anyone's really i don't know

640.959 --> 644.16
else

641.44 --> 646.9590000000001
how else to really deal with it though i

644.16 --> 649.04
did already apologize

646.959 --> 650.079
because yeah sometimes when it boils up

649.04 --> 654.64
it can get just

650.079 --> 657.12
really freaking nasty and it's like

654.64 --> 658.72
yeah it's it's kind of useless even

657.12 --> 661.68
getting into it it's not like

658.72 --> 663.44
wild rage it's just this tyrannical

661.68 --> 666.8
justice type of rage that's

663.44 --> 669.44
completely over overboard and it's not

666.8 --> 669.4399999999999
good either

670.24 --> 674.8
it's just yeah

673.279 --> 678.8
i really need to learn how to deal with

674.8 --> 678.8
that better i get it away

679.76 --> 683.36
i'm glad it was me yeah i know robin

681.68 --> 686.079
stanley i know you're

683.36 --> 688.5600000000001
most people you understand it it's still

686.079 --> 691.04
though you know karmically

688.56 --> 691.5999999999999
i shouldn't have done that despite

691.04 --> 696.56
everything

691.6 --> 699.0400000000001
anyway hey eagle playing anchor

696.56 --> 699.8389999999999
but yes there's some really freaky [ __ ]

699.04 --> 703.519
happening

699.839 --> 707.2790000000001
out there man and it's getting to people

703.519 --> 710.72
like all these freaking freaky blm

707.279 --> 711.76
shootings and [ __ ] and there was this

710.72 --> 715.2
one occasion

711.76 --> 717.279
where it just like it

715.2 --> 719.279
it kind of distracted me away from the

717.279 --> 720.88
previous rich i also shared that but

719.279 --> 722.16
yeah i'm not going to get into it too

720.88 --> 725.279
deep i'm not even going to show that

722.16 --> 728.48
video but it was this guy

725.279 --> 730.48
of blm group and they yeah he was even

728.48 --> 733.839
like wearing a pretty big

730.48 --> 737.519
machine gun or whatever that is a

733.839 --> 740.32
not a handgun and yeah they were all

737.519 --> 742.48
just marching and [ __ ]

740.32 --> 744.399
and then a car yeah they were the

742.48 --> 746.48
blockades were apparently removed from

744.399 --> 747.2
that location so the car could just go

746.48 --> 748.639
there

747.2 --> 751.36
and he wanted to get through and then

748.639 --> 753.519
they kind of rushed it and i think

751.36 --> 754.88
i couldn't see it but it said that they

753.519 --> 757.2
some of them even

754.88 --> 759.12
fired shots at the cars which is

757.2 --> 761.36
completely insane

759.12 --> 762.5600000000001
but yeah inside the guy was well

761.36 --> 765.76
prepared and he just

762.56 --> 768.8
shot him like

765.76 --> 773.12
fatally and it's just

768.8 --> 777.279
so messed up because the guy was clearly

773.12 --> 781.44
insane like

777.279 --> 783.04
not yeah in like so far delusion he

781.44 --> 785.6
literally didn't know what

783.04 --> 786.16
how things worked anymore for real he

785.6 --> 788.24
was so

786.16 --> 790.7199999999999
sunk into that but he was there yeah it

788.24 --> 794.72
was very upsetting

790.72 --> 797.279
but like that the insane insane tragedy

794.72 --> 798.72
is when you look and i kind of did that

797.279 --> 802.8
by accident i guess

798.72 --> 806.24
just looked into the guy this photo and

802.8 --> 806.88
it is a huge tragedy and i'll explain a

806.24 --> 811.12
bit why

806.88 --> 814.16
the guy was the sole caretaker

811.12 --> 817.36
and yeah the

814.16 --> 820.079
the husband of a parapleg

817.36 --> 821.839
i don't even know how to say it properly

820.079 --> 825.92
paraplegic

821.839 --> 825.9200000000001
a woman that had no arms and legs

826.32 --> 835.0400000000001
who was by the way there too and

829.92 --> 835.04
yeah because of his completely insane

835.44 --> 838.5600000000001
actions he got himself killed and now

837.68 --> 840.959
that

838.56 --> 842.56
freaking person without arms and legs

840.959 --> 843.3599999999999
doesn't have a husband and caretaker

842.56 --> 846.6389999999999
anymore like

843.36 --> 848.399
ah and then yeah all the other people

846.639 --> 851.76
were like oh my god oh my god

848.399 --> 853.519
yeah no [ __ ] no [ __ ] why did you allow

851.76 --> 856.0
that guy to do that

853.519 --> 856.88
now he's freaking dead and now that

856.0 --> 860.16
person is

856.88 --> 861.8389999999999
just gonna go through a hell that he

860.16 --> 864.0
can't describe

861.839 --> 864.0
like

865.839 --> 870.5600000000001
it's it's really bitter because in one

868.16 --> 874.0
hand yeah these

870.56 --> 875.68
they kind of i can't escape it that i do

874.0 --> 879.6
think that they somewhat

875.68 --> 881.8389999999999
deserve it it's just like

879.6 --> 884.0
i don't understand how these people can

881.839 --> 887.1990000000001
be in these positions and allow

884.0 --> 888.24
this to happen to themselves by their

887.199 --> 891.92
own stupidity

888.24 --> 892.639
by their own very ill thought through

891.92 --> 896.0
actions

892.639 --> 896.0
i don't understand

896.56 --> 903.5999999999999
it's very bitter to me

900.88 --> 905.519
now if it was just freaking bastard

903.6 --> 908.8000000000001
thugs you know

905.519 --> 909.44
that nobody cared about anyway that word

908.8 --> 912.3199999999999
that were

909.44 --> 912.72
alone or whatever yeah it's different

912.32 --> 916.32
but

912.72 --> 916.32
this is just insane

917.04 --> 920.959
yeah he was someone's son of course i

919.519 --> 923.279
know

920.959 --> 927.8389999999999
of course everybody's somebody's son or

923.279 --> 927.8389999999999
daughter but

927.92 --> 932.7199999999999
yeah and that one that was just one of

930.32 --> 934.9590000000001
the things and it was pretty [ __ ] up

932.72 --> 938.399
but there were probably even other

934.959 --> 939.92
situations that i even didn't look into

938.399 --> 942.24
after that point because i think there

939.92 --> 946.7199999999999
were like a bunch of that

942.24 --> 949.04
that were like

946.72 --> 949.0400000000001
ugh

949.839 --> 957.12
i think like a like baby got shot or so

953.36 --> 957.12
it's so disgusting all that [ __ ]

957.68 --> 962.919
just ugh

959.77 --> 962.919
[Music]

963.839 --> 967.759
it's odd it's not what i expected it to

966.639 --> 970.0790000000001
be

967.759 --> 971.279
it's really like a bunch of puppets that

970.079 --> 974.959
are all in hell

971.279 --> 977.68
and they're just stuck in this

974.959 --> 978.16
collective mind control directive and

977.68 --> 984.079
they

978.16 --> 984.079
they can't get out but it's like like

984.24 --> 988.16
i do they even really want to do that or

987.36 --> 991.04
are they just

988.16 --> 992.16
driven to this and they don't know what

991.04 --> 994.0
else to do

992.16 --> 997.8389999999999
and they're just completely insane like

994.0 --> 997.839
that no

1000.88 --> 1003.68
right anyway

1004.72 --> 1007.759
yeah you all probably have seen your own

1006.8 --> 1011.5999999999999
fair share of

1007.759 --> 1013.6
these disgusting situations and all that

1011.6 --> 1016.399
their instincts are being exploited yeah

1013.6 --> 1018.88
that that seems to be the case

1016.399 --> 1020.0
it's like the mechanisms that are in the

1018.88 --> 1024.559
in the human being

1020.0 --> 1027.679
psyche switching switches

1024.559 --> 1030.079
like positions you take into in response

1027.679 --> 1030.799
to things it's like it's all been mapped

1030.079 --> 1034.3999999999999
out

1030.799 --> 1037.28
the complete works of how people respond

1034.4 --> 1037.6000000000001
and then a social engineering blueprint

1037.28 --> 1039.839
of

1037.6 --> 1041.6789999999999
instructions for every level where you

1039.839 --> 1044.6399999999999
go to has been presented

1041.679 --> 1045.8390000000002
and these people are stuck in that you

1044.64 --> 1047.8390000000002
can't get out

1045.839 --> 1049.039
their mind can't get out because

1047.839 --> 1052.1599999999999
everywhere they go

1049.039 --> 1055.52
they it's accounted for every there's

1052.16 --> 1067.8400000000001
every corner it's turn

1055.52 --> 1067.84
this is hell

1068.32 --> 1071.52
anyway yeah years of social planning

1071.2 --> 1075.679
well

1071.52 --> 1075.679
it's been designed for the century

1078.84 --> 1083.4399999999998
probably

1081.52 --> 1084.96
yeah yeah in the netherlands there's a

1083.44 --> 1088.0800000000002
lot of uh

1084.96 --> 1088.08
a lot of backlash

1091.84 --> 1096.3999999999999
like there's not even that many people

1093.52 --> 1098.799
here wearing masks and there's just

1096.4 --> 1099.6000000000001
the outrage is growing and pouring over

1098.799 --> 1102.559
the whole

1099.6 --> 1105.9189999999999
way the government is dealing with this

1102.559 --> 1109.84
the insane expenditures and all that

1105.919 --> 1109.8400000000001
and they're in trouble

1112.0 --> 1118.16
i i'm kind of glad about it they should

1115.12 --> 1118.1599999999999
be in trouble for that

1121.2 --> 1125.679
all right also i've been hearing more

1123.44 --> 1126.4
echoing echoing it's funny because i

1125.679 --> 1129.3600000000001
addressed it

1126.4 --> 1129.8400000000001
right away but alex jones is echoing

1129.36 --> 1132.799
yeah

1129.84 --> 1134.24
he's now kind of like literally yeah i

1132.799 --> 1135.2
watch a bit of alex johnson do it

1134.24 --> 1139.039
sometimes it

1135.2 --> 1141.2
uh was it the sunday show that i watched

1139.039 --> 1143.44
was it yesterday i don't remember i

1141.2 --> 1146.0800000000002
don't think i watched it yesterday live

1143.44 --> 1147.679
it was probably still the sunday show

1146.08 --> 1150.0
but he was addressing

1147.679 --> 1151.679
for yeah this was odd he was addressing

1150.0 --> 1155.44
the missing of his toothpaste and

1151.679 --> 1158.88
apparently he's now replacing it with a

1155.44 --> 1161.52
was it an active carbon type

1158.88 --> 1163.2800000000002
like he's not doing it anymore because

1161.52 --> 1166.559
any kind of backtracked on it this

1163.28 --> 1168.08
hilarious to me like anyway who cares

1166.559 --> 1168.8799999999999
you know among you but he was trying to

1168.08 --> 1172.3999999999999
backtrack

1168.88 --> 1173.3600000000001
like say yeah it was mistakenly assumed

1172.4 --> 1177.679
that i said it

1173.36 --> 1180.24
it helped against the kuronu

1177.679 --> 1182.16
and yeah i literally was there when he

1180.24 --> 1185.2
said that life he did get all

1182.16 --> 1187.3600000000001
uh okay it's too much money opportunity

1185.2 --> 1189.28
he just couldn't let it go and he had to

1187.36 --> 1192.6399999999999
[ __ ] say it because he's a

1189.28 --> 1193.6
money grubbing doubling down [ __ ] when

1192.64 --> 1196.0800000000002
it comes to that

1193.6 --> 1197.84
he is in love with money he can't help

1196.08 --> 1199.6789999999999
it he's trying not to be but he can't

1197.84 --> 1201.9189999999999
help but these moments he can't

1199.679 --> 1204.0
help but grab it he has to do it every

1201.919 --> 1207.039
time it's his curse

1204.0 --> 1208.32
it's his curse it's a curse right but he

1207.039 --> 1209.6
said it and he

1208.32 --> 1211.84
immediately probably knew the

1209.6 --> 1214.559
consequences and yeah a person had

1211.84 --> 1217.6789999999999
organized something and tried to sue him

1214.559 --> 1220.32
over it and he had to retract it

1217.679 --> 1221.3600000000001
the product it's and it was probably his

1220.32 --> 1224.559
best product

1221.36 --> 1226.8799999999999
ever yeah alex you did that with your

1224.559 --> 1229.9189999999999
[ __ ] greed

1226.88 --> 1233.0390000000002
you destroyed your best product

1229.919 --> 1236.3200000000002
ever i

1233.039 --> 1239.679
i called it like that it's the best

1236.32 --> 1242.96
toothpaste that was ever made yeah

1239.679 --> 1245.52
and now you you got now a because of

1242.96 --> 1248.72
some social justice where you freak

1245.52 --> 1251.52
you can't you

1248.72 --> 1253.679
you can't sell the best product ever

1251.52 --> 1255.12
congratulations buddy

1253.679 --> 1257.3600000000001
you might want to do something about

1255.12 --> 1257.36
that

1259.36 --> 1263.52
right but that happened and he was

1262.48 --> 1266.64
doubling down

1263.52 --> 1270.8799999999999
and i think he's right i even

1266.64 --> 1274.0800000000002
suggested that it very early this year

1270.88 --> 1278.24
that 5g probably causes these

1274.08 --> 1282.72
flu-like symptoms that will be directly

1278.24 --> 1286.88
correlating with the corona situation

1282.72 --> 1287.44
yeah there's more strong indications of

1286.88 --> 1289.919
this

1287.44 --> 1292.0800000000002
coming out and he called it and i call

1289.919 --> 1292.0800000000002
it

1292.96 --> 1298.559
very early so yeah

1296.4 --> 1300.88
you know that's kind of the reason why i

1298.559 --> 1303.6789999999999
still keep tabs it's not like i

1300.88 --> 1304.0
enjoy watching most of his show a lot of

1303.679 --> 1307.8400000000001
it is

1304.0 --> 1309.12
like really baseline alex jones level

1307.84 --> 1314.1589999999999
stuff and

1309.12 --> 1316.9599999999998
left right anti-muslims all that

1314.159 --> 1320.159
protective of jews as many ways as

1316.96 --> 1323.2
possible you know how it works how his

1320.159 --> 1323.2
narrative works

1324.159 --> 1330.64
but still yeah he's had a history and i

1327.2 --> 1330.64
followed that history and it's

1331.6 --> 1337.4399999999998
he's still trying to be truthful

1334.64 --> 1338.5590000000002
people don't really understand that he

1337.44 --> 1340.48
couldn't probably

1338.559 --> 1342.6399999999999
he would crash if he stopped doing that

1340.48 --> 1345.039
but he is very much

1342.64 --> 1349.2800000000002
there's a lot of other [ __ ] and

1345.039 --> 1349.28
narrative building and plans in that

1349.52 --> 1355.039
anyway that happened too i didn't even

1352.24 --> 1355.039
make a note of that

1359.84 --> 1375.84
uh anything else

1387.12 --> 1393.76
right anyway yeah that was just uh

1391.44 --> 1395.44
because i am seriously pissed off that

1393.76 --> 1398.32
he retracted that product

1395.44 --> 1398.3200000000002
i really am

1401.2 --> 1405.28
i'm pissed off at myself that i didn't

1403.2 --> 1406.96
order more than three tubes the last

1405.28 --> 1408.32
time i did it i should have just ordered

1406.96 --> 1410.48
20

1408.32 --> 1417.84
but i didn't know that he was gonna stop

1410.48 --> 1417.84
doing yeah producing it

1419.84 --> 1426.3999999999999
he should just try to re like literally

1423.039 --> 1428.8799999999999
make the same product and reformulate it

1426.4 --> 1430.159
in a yeah and he's doing now the new

1428.88 --> 1433.679
type

1430.159 --> 1433.679
but it's not going to be the same

1433.919 --> 1440.159
anyway toothpaste

1436.96 --> 1441.919
yay because now i'm basically just

1440.159 --> 1443.8400000000001
improvising with other brands of

1441.919 --> 1445.039
toothpaste and i'm not really liking

1443.84 --> 1447.6
them all too well

1445.039 --> 1449.679
so i'm really eager to find a better one

1447.6 --> 1450.32
i prefer one that has colloidal silver

1449.679 --> 1453.3600000000001
in it and

1450.32 --> 1456.559
iodine and yeah and tea tree oil and

1453.36 --> 1459.6
that's exactly what his toothpaste had

1456.559 --> 1462.8799999999999
and there is none of that out there

1459.6 --> 1462.8799999999999
now anyway

1470.84 --> 1473.84
uh

1477.44 --> 1480.88
hi yeah i'm having a lot of good

1479.679 --> 1483.919
feedback from

1480.88 --> 1483.919
dejan these days

1484.32 --> 1488.72
he's not on a lot speaking but he's very

1487.84 --> 1491.36
active in

1488.72 --> 1493.76
in chats and all that it's good to hear

1491.36 --> 1493.76
from him

1494.88 --> 1498.72
apparently his he brought up an idea

1498.32 --> 1502.72
that's

1498.72 --> 1506.0
kind of funny it's conceptual because i

1502.72 --> 1508.4
suggested on the debates yesterday

1506.0 --> 1510.4
that as kind of from a baller

1508.4 --> 1512.88
perspective that maybe

1510.4 --> 1513.44
entropy yeah the gas pressure expansion

1512.88 --> 1516.88
simply

1513.44 --> 1519.8400000000001
changes at a certain height that

1516.88 --> 1520.88
the function of gas changes or entropy

1519.84 --> 1524.08
itself changes

1520.88 --> 1525.5200000000002
and then asian kind of took that mind

1524.08 --> 1527.9189999999999
experiment of mine

1525.52 --> 1528.8799999999999
which is like yeah it's trying to

1527.919 --> 1530.96
basically

1528.88 --> 1532.88
discontort natural law suggesting that

1530.96 --> 1534.24
it might not be natural law at some

1532.88 --> 1538.0800000000002
point

1534.24 --> 1538.08
without any direct evidence for it

1538.32 --> 1544.48
but he took it on to the idea that

1541.039 --> 1548.8799999999999
entropy itself might be the container

1544.48 --> 1548.88
that's just yeah surreal

1549.2 --> 1557.8400000000001
beijing he's a great guy

1552.88 --> 1557.8400000000001
very smart

1558.799 --> 1563.679
yeah yeah over my golf i of i'm my

1562.0 --> 1565.039
toothpaste of course is not gonna

1563.679 --> 1567.76
contain fluoride and there's still

1565.039 --> 1567.76
plenty of that

1569.12 --> 1576.3999999999999
uh i'm never

1572.4 --> 1576.4
touching fluorite [ __ ] again

1580.96 --> 1585.44
but there's more toothpastes even out

1583.52 --> 1587.12
there that i'm

1585.44 --> 1588.96
that i'm gonna try but i'm not gonna

1587.12 --> 1590.559
like buy a whole bunch of them and then

1588.96 --> 1592.96
try them one out and

1590.559 --> 1594.96
i really need to know what it does over

1592.96 --> 1599.2
time so when i

1594.96 --> 1602.799
i just take one type and then i use it

1599.2 --> 1606.63
every day for a month and then see what

1602.799 --> 1609.279
what changes if it is doing any good

1606.63 --> 1611.1200000000001
[Music]

1609.279 --> 1612.88
and one of the weirder conclusions is

1611.12 --> 1614.559
that one of the toothpastes that i'm

1612.88 --> 1616.64
using right now would seem to be

1614.559 --> 1619.12
originating from denmark

1616.64 --> 1619.679
and yeah it has tea tree oil in it but

1619.12 --> 1622.2399999999998
this cut

1619.679 --> 1622.799
despite that it's pretty damn disgusting

1622.24 --> 1627.44
it's like

1622.799 --> 1630.559
really disgusting feels like i'm

1627.44 --> 1632.0
like tooth brushing with

1630.559 --> 1634.6399999999999
paint or something it's really

1632.0 --> 1637.44
disgusting but

1634.64 --> 1638.64
it does seem to work very well that's

1637.44 --> 1640.24
the surprise it's like

1638.64 --> 1642.48
almost a disappointment it's like ah

1640.24 --> 1646.08
come on why does this one have to work

1642.48 --> 1646.08
so well it's really disgusting

1647.039 --> 1650.24
but yeah anyway

1650.559 --> 1654.08
i'm afraid that i'm gonna have to stick

1652.24 --> 1657.2
to that one

1654.08 --> 1660.6399999999999
even though i don't like it

1657.2 --> 1660.64
until i can find a better one

1661.76 --> 1665.2
hey guns i've never run rmp

1665.679 --> 1669.8400000000001
the mandy young

1672.72 --> 1677.76
all right so let's not talk about

1674.88 --> 1677.7600000000002
toothpaste again

1680.48 --> 1686.32
anything flat earth related somebody has

1682.72 --> 1686.32
any questions about

1687.44 --> 1697.8400000000001
any of my conceptions

1717.76 --> 1721.12
what do i think the comet is i think the

1719.919 --> 1724.72
comet is a light

1721.12 --> 1727.36
is it like a temporary celestial light

1724.72 --> 1727.3600000000001
phenomena

1734.799 --> 1738.72
although yeah i'm not a hundred percent

1737.36 --> 1741.039
entirely sure

1738.72 --> 1744.3990000000001
like can i have some direct input about

1741.039 --> 1748.08
it because i haven't double checked this

1744.399 --> 1752.08
but does it actually

1748.08 --> 1753.279
rotate to 15 degrees per hour

1752.08 --> 1756.6399999999999
like the rest of the globe of the

1753.279 --> 1759.6
heavens is it stuck to the backdrop

1756.64 --> 1760.24
or does it really keep hanging in the

1759.6 --> 1764.7199999999998
same

1760.24 --> 1781.84
angular location constantly how is that

1764.72 --> 1781.84
can anybody inform me about that

1782.72 --> 1787.1200000000001
yeah tom parker it's definitely not a

1784.88 --> 1788.96
rock

1787.12 --> 1790.6399999999999
i'm just wondering what type of light

1788.96 --> 1793.8400000000001
phenomena it is it could be an

1790.64 --> 1796.159
electric phenomena you know if

1793.84 --> 1797.279
it's not moving with the globe of the

1796.159 --> 1801.3600000000001
heavens like every

1797.279 --> 1803.679
like the stars then and it's like

1801.36 --> 1806.24
literally hanging in the same angular

1803.679 --> 1809.2
location all day and night

1806.24 --> 1809.76
from beginning to end then it might be

1809.2 --> 1812.72
like a

1809.76 --> 1813.84
plasma electrical phenomena that is like

1812.72 --> 1816.24
interacting

1813.84 --> 1819.039
at a local in a local way in the

1816.24 --> 1819.039
physical realm

1819.919 --> 1824.159
but kind of like affecting the celestial

1823.6 --> 1827.52
light

1824.159 --> 1829.919
system see

1827.52 --> 1832.0
like a plasmic distortion let's go

1829.919 --> 1836.3200000000002
techno but like a plasmic distortion

1832.0 --> 1838.24
in the celestial holographic system

1836.32 --> 1840.32
there you go that's what i think a comet

1838.24 --> 1840.32
is

1841.2 --> 1844.799
but it only depends on if it is actually

1843.76 --> 1847.919
rotating

1844.799 --> 1850.8799999999999
with the celestial sphere or if it isn't

1847.919 --> 1851.44
so anybody that could inform me about

1850.88 --> 1854.159
that

1851.44 --> 1865.8400000000001
that would be great i'm addressing

1854.159 --> 1865.8400000000001
people in chat now

1866.16 --> 1872.77
[Music]

1868.72 --> 1876.279
what guiding stone am i a guiding stone

1872.77 --> 1876.279
[Music]

1876.72 --> 1880.799
is that another way of saying that i

1878.559 --> 1880.799
rock

1890.84 --> 1893.84
anyway

1902.0 --> 1906.0
maybe if i hadn't banned so much ballers

1904.48 --> 1909.44
i'd probably get an answer from them

1906.0 --> 1911.36
now but yeah that wouldn't be worth

1909.44 --> 1912.72
having to endure all their whining

1911.36 --> 1916.32
constantly

1912.72 --> 1921.039
so i had hoped that some of you would

1916.32 --> 1924.399
have a direct answer for this

1921.039 --> 1928.24
does the comet sighting rotate with

1924.399 --> 1931.36
the celestial sphere 15 degrees per hour

1928.24 --> 1933.1200000000001
or does it stay in angular exact

1931.36 --> 1935.84
location

1933.12 --> 1935.84
at all time

1946.84 --> 1949.84
what

1950.48 --> 1952.72
uh

1956.159 --> 1961.0390000000002
no i'm pretty sure you didn't answer

1958.48 --> 1963.84
that just a confused dude

1961.039 --> 1963.84
pretty sure you didn't

1964.72 --> 1970.88
it just said it's it's a rock

1968.159 --> 1971.519
or ice or whatever you didn't answer i'm

1970.88 --> 1974.64
asking an

1971.519 --> 1974.64
angular question

1974.72 --> 1977.919
it's a sighting right so is that

1976.799 --> 1981.12
sighting

1977.919 --> 1984.5590000000002
rotating with the stars

1981.12 --> 1986.399
exactly 15 degrees per hour

1984.559 --> 1989.44
is it like a piece like a little

1986.399 --> 1993.039
painting on that celestial sphere

1989.44 --> 1995.8400000000001
or is it standing still

1993.039 --> 1997.44
and staying in exact angular position

1995.84 --> 2001.4399999999998
all day and night for as long as you can

1997.44 --> 2001.44
see it can somebody please answer my

2002.84 --> 2005.84
question

2015.519 --> 2018.88
maybe i can rephrase it a little bit

2017.679 --> 2022.3200000000002
more easy

2018.88 --> 2025.7600000000002
does it move does the comet

2022.32 --> 2027.039
move one moment you look at it it's

2025.76 --> 2029.2
there

2027.039 --> 2030.08
two hours later you look at it hey it's

2029.2 --> 2033.8400000000001
there

2030.08 --> 2033.84
is that the case

2036.12 --> 2039.29
[Music]

2047.12 --> 2053.52
the question is does a commit

2050.639 --> 2054.639
the comet that is cited i've seen it

2053.52 --> 2057.52
with my eyes

2054.639 --> 2058.3990000000003
couldn't pick it up with the p900 does

2057.52 --> 2061.52
it

2058.399 --> 2064.96
rotate with the stars

2061.52 --> 2068.399
the 15 degrees per hour or

2064.96 --> 2071.679
does it not rotate with the stars

2068.399 --> 2072.399
does it stay in the exact same angular

2071.679 --> 2074.56
position

2072.399 --> 2077.2799999999997
in relation to the observer as long as

2074.56 --> 2079.7599999999998
they don't change their position

2077.28 --> 2081.679
all the time does it stay in its place

2079.76 --> 2089.8390000000004
visually

2081.679 --> 2089.839
come on people

2095.599 --> 2102.56
all right well thanks guns of nephron at

2097.76 --> 2104.8
least you're trying to answer it

2102.56 --> 2104.7999999999997
god

2108.96 --> 2113.2
can you guys please stop spamming about

2111.52 --> 2116.4
freaking orbits and

2113.2 --> 2118.0789999999997
rocks or ice moving it's not the

2116.4 --> 2121.44
question i'm asking

2118.079 --> 2123.8390000000004
celestial angular questions

2121.44 --> 2123.839
you know

2127.839 --> 2133.68
not asking you to share your

2130.68 --> 2133.68
presuppositions

2136.95 --> 2141.0
[Music]

2143.76 --> 2150.0
well eyes wide shut thank you thank you

2147.68 --> 2152.48
see there's people out there that

2150.0 --> 2155.2
actually know how to answer a question

2152.48 --> 2156.96
or at least input some relevant data

2155.2 --> 2158.0789999999997
they understand why i even asked the

2156.96 --> 2161.359
question

2158.079 --> 2161.8390000000004
thank you right so he says he's seen a

2161.359 --> 2164.64
comet

2161.839 --> 2166.56
20 years ago and it didn't rotate with

2164.64 --> 2167.7599999999998
the stars it stayed in place well there

2166.56 --> 2172.0789999999997
you go

2167.76 --> 2174.48
so that gives some more legitimacy to my

2172.079 --> 2175.28
supposed technobabble explanation that a

2174.48 --> 2178.72
comet might

2175.28 --> 2182.2400000000002
actually be a

2178.72 --> 2185.4399999999996
plasmic phenomena that interacts

2182.24 --> 2188.0789999999997
with the holographic system of the globe

2185.44 --> 2188.079
of the heavens

2189.119 --> 2201.839
i guess i have a title for my show now

2206.0 --> 2208.32
right

2210.16 --> 2214.16
independent from the stars okay well

2213.52 --> 2216.8
it's still

2214.16 --> 2217.359
important to know if it is moving

2216.8 --> 2221.2000000000003
because

2217.359 --> 2225.2
it could be designated onto the level

2221.2 --> 2228.3999999999996
of planetary celestial

2225.2 --> 2231.359
phenomena because planets move too

2228.4 --> 2232.8
in a very specific pathway or maybe the

2231.359 --> 2235.839
comet

2232.8 --> 2239.28
also has like a planetary pathway

2235.839 --> 2242.64
on the celestial sphere

2239.28 --> 2245.119
maybe it's like slower

2242.64 --> 2247.2799999999997
than the celestial sphere itself i don't

2245.119 --> 2247.28
know

2251.04 --> 2256.4
if that were the case then it is

2252.8 --> 2258.88
probably not a plasmic phenomena

2256.4 --> 2260.96
because in order for it to literally be

2258.88 --> 2264.1600000000003
a physical phenomena here

2260.96 --> 2265.119
physically in the realm it would kind of

2264.16 --> 2267.68
have to stay

2265.119 --> 2267.6800000000003
in place

2269.599 --> 2273.76
like angular play the angular position

2272.96 --> 2276.7200000000003
wouldn't

2273.76 --> 2278.2400000000002
have to be absolutely constant and then

2276.72 --> 2280.7999999999997
yeah you could

2278.24 --> 2280.7999999999997
start to

2281.44 --> 2287.28
figure out calculate presume

2284.64 --> 2290.16
more solidly that it is exactly in a

2287.28 --> 2290.1600000000003
literal position

2293.359 --> 2297.119
that it might be like a plasmic

2295.28 --> 2300.2400000000002
phenomena that

2297.119 --> 2313.839
that yeah interacts

2300.24 --> 2313.839
whoa why was my video so behind weird

2314.48 --> 2319.119
weird youtube is stalling for me i don't

2317.28 --> 2321.2000000000003
know you probably don't are not noticing

2319.119 --> 2321.2000000000003
it

2323.76 --> 2328.0
but yeah if if it is literally moving

2326.48 --> 2330.16
with the celestial sphere like the

2328.0 --> 2332.72
planet then it's probably not a plasma

2330.16 --> 2332.72
phenomena

2335.359 --> 2340.44
then it's probably just as holographic

2338.0 --> 2342.88
as everything else

2340.44 --> 2346.16
[Music]

2342.88 --> 2346.1600000000003
from the celestial sphere

2348.88 --> 2352.1600000000003
you know uh compare it to for example

2351.839 --> 2355.599
the

2352.16 --> 2359.04
the northern lights those are

2355.599 --> 2361.52
or even identified as plasmic phenomena

2359.04 --> 2364.16
and they have angular positions you can

2361.52 --> 2366.4
approach them they become bigger to you

2364.16 --> 2367.2
go away they can become smaller go over

2366.4 --> 2370.48
the horizon

2367.2 --> 2375.68
they disappear out of sight

2370.48 --> 2378.96
eventually so those are local things

2375.68 --> 2382.72
so based on that idea i theorized

2378.96 --> 2385.119
that if a comet siding would always be

2382.72 --> 2386.9599999999996
in exact the same angular location not

2385.119 --> 2388.8
rotate in any sort of way with the

2386.96 --> 2391.2
celestial sphere but stay in exact

2388.8 --> 2393.119
angular position

2391.2 --> 2394.839
as long as the observer does not change

2393.119 --> 2398.48
their position

2394.839 --> 2398.88
that it might be a local phenomena as

2398.48 --> 2401.44
well

2398.88 --> 2403.28
similar to northern lights but yeah if

2401.44 --> 2408.56
it if there are comets at

2403.28 --> 2410.8
all rotating angular wise

2408.56 --> 2412.16
in relation to the observer over time

2410.8 --> 2425.8390000000004
then yeah that

2412.16 --> 2425.839
concept becomes a lot slimmer

2432.8 --> 2439.8390000000004
shooting luminary

2443.68 --> 2450.56
right well you know shooting stars to me

2448.319 --> 2452.0
especially the celestial ones that only

2450.56 --> 2454.0
are up there not the ones that

2452.0 --> 2455.119
come down here that is just really

2454.0 --> 2466.88
freaking weird to me

2455.119 --> 2469.119
i don't get that

2466.88 --> 2469.119
it's

2471.04 --> 2475.359
yeah now my fantasy is just showing me

2473.28 --> 2479.119
all kinds of weird things now

2475.359 --> 2480.96
i'm trying to imagine that it may be

2479.119 --> 2482.1600000000003
me to your rights the ones that actually

2480.96 --> 2485.04
have a proximity that

2482.16 --> 2485.68
come really close leave remnants maybe

2485.04 --> 2489.599
they're not

2485.68 --> 2490.0789999999997
like pieces that have broken off maybe

2489.599 --> 2492.839
those

2490.079 --> 2494.6400000000003
are literally materials that have just

2492.839 --> 2498.24
gathered

2494.64 --> 2502.319
stayed up there stayed afloat in wind

2498.24 --> 2502.319
situations and that somehow they

2502.8 --> 2507.2000000000003
changed you know maybe it's like

2505.44 --> 2510.319
transmuted

2507.2 --> 2511.9199999999996
material up there that just for some

2510.319 --> 2515.2799999999997
reason naturally like

2511.92 --> 2516.0
almost like hill gathers in lower much

2515.28 --> 2518.2400000000002
lower in

2516.0 --> 2520.8
clouds and then a hailstone comes down

2518.24 --> 2522.24
right well maybe meteors are kind of a

2520.8 --> 2525.52
similar process

2522.24 --> 2527.839
at a much higher level and it's just a

2525.52 --> 2528.319
really bizarre phenomena that material

2527.839 --> 2530.4
that

2528.319 --> 2532.079
normally just stays afloat extremely

2530.4 --> 2534.2400000000002
high would

2532.079 --> 2536.1600000000003
i know for some electrical reasons start

2534.24 --> 2539.04
to collect and then

2536.16 --> 2540.56
literally gather and become like a rock

2539.04 --> 2543.52
and start to fall down because the

2540.56 --> 2546.96
density situation

2543.52 --> 2551.839
yeah yeah yeah yeah [ __ ]

2546.96 --> 2551.839
off [ __ ]

2556.24 --> 2560.3999999999996
yeah if anybody sees anything

2560.88 --> 2565.6800000000003
like that that little that specific

2564.72 --> 2569.52
globe with the grid

2565.68 --> 2572.319
right instant ban instant

2569.52 --> 2572.319
i don't care

2574.4 --> 2580.079
anyway it's just an idea no maybe it

2578.24 --> 2580.64
could be like this incredible type of

2580.079 --> 2582.4
hail

2580.64 --> 2584.72
and it may be it's probably a lot more

2582.4 --> 2586.8
rare that it even happens

2584.72 --> 2588.24
but yeah the electrical situation up

2586.8 --> 2591.599
there

2588.24 --> 2592.24
who knows what it is like and we know

2591.599 --> 2595.2000000000003
that

2592.24 --> 2596.24
extreme electricity does have a tendency

2595.2 --> 2607.839
to really

2596.24 --> 2607.839
change material around so

2613.44 --> 2617.76
no just to confuse dude no

2618.079 --> 2624.2400000000002
there is no rocks floating out there

2622.24 --> 2634.64
relative density doesn't end there's no

2624.24 --> 2638.0
proof of that

2634.64 --> 2641.04
if there are things that are as dense as

2638.0 --> 2644.16
as the ground you walk on

2641.04 --> 2646.72
it cannot be up there

2644.16 --> 2648.24
because yeah it's going to be definitely

2646.72 --> 2650.48
surrounded by it

2648.24 --> 2652.0789999999997
by the air or whatever is left of it

2650.48 --> 2654.0
very thin air

2652.079 --> 2655.52
that's gonna be a lot less dense it's

2654.0 --> 2658.56
gonna come down

2655.52 --> 2661.2
it's very little stopping it

2658.56 --> 2662.0
because yeah that effect the relative

2661.2 --> 2664.64
density

2662.0 --> 2665.44
displacement due to this equilibrium it

2664.64 --> 2669.2
doesn't

2665.44 --> 2672.2400000000002
end doesn't even decrease

2669.2 --> 2675.359
there's no floating there's no falling

2672.24 --> 2676.3999999999996
with less speed it there's no proof of

2675.359 --> 2680.4
this

2676.4 --> 2683.52
the only emulations that even been

2680.4 --> 2686.56
try to emulate zero g is

2683.52 --> 2691.839
through a diving plane because there is

2686.56 --> 2691.839
no position where that actually happens

2692.079 --> 2697.04
there are none electrona 3

2701.119 --> 2706.48
either they form through some kind of

2704.04 --> 2707.7599999999998
transmutation and then start to gain

2706.48 --> 2713.04
mass

2707.76 --> 2716.8
gain density and fall or well yeah

2713.04 --> 2718.56
who knows could fall

2716.8 --> 2720.6400000000003
yeah some would suggest it's breaking

2718.56 --> 2723.7599999999998
off the the wall of the cave

2720.64 --> 2723.7599999999998
that we are actually in

2724.319 --> 2728.96
or who knows maybe it's even freaking

2726.8 --> 2732.4
weirder maybe there's literally just

2728.96 --> 2734.88
god's to your gun

2732.4 --> 2734.88
up there

2736.8 --> 2742.7200000000003
yeah if you want to go with full

2740.56 --> 2743.92
full designers perspective again maybe

2742.72 --> 2746.16
it's just has

2743.92 --> 2749.839
yeah a special it has a special purpose

2746.16 --> 2749.839
he just has a freaking meteor gun

2750.0 --> 2754.72
and we just don't understand why

2753.04 --> 2757.89
why he would do that

2754.72 --> 2757.89
[Music]

2758.56 --> 2761.839
oh [ __ ]

2761.92 --> 2766.16
maybe to shoot down uh people that have

2765.359 --> 2768.88
managed to

2766.16 --> 2770.3999999999996
get past the the first shield maybe it's

2768.88 --> 2771.92
just gonna point the meteor gun at them

2770.4 --> 2776.7200000000003
and just like oh oh really

2771.92 --> 2779.76
oh there you go splat

2776.72 --> 2788.3999999999996
it is who knows

2779.76 --> 2790.4
it's the next level dudes yeah now

2788.4 --> 2792.8
there's no proof of this ice

2790.4 --> 2794.079
there's no proof whatsoever there's no

2792.8 --> 2798.319
water that comes

2794.079 --> 2803.119
from it there's no proof that

2798.319 --> 2807.7599999999998
comets in any way cause some kind of

2803.119 --> 2807.76
increase of water or even hydrogen

2811.68 --> 2817.359
ah electrona3 really that's

2815.119 --> 2818.8
that's fascinating i didn't even know

2817.359 --> 2822.48
that

2818.8 --> 2825.28
yeah i i basically just

2822.48 --> 2826.72
described that didn't i just throws me

2825.28 --> 2829.599
to rights or he just has

2826.72 --> 2832.3999999999996
a you know i'm basically assuming that

2829.599 --> 2832.4
god is like

2833.68 --> 2838.16
i don't think he's like this big giant

2835.839 --> 2838.72
thing that constantly is warping the

2838.16 --> 2840.64
physical

2838.72 --> 2842.3999999999996
normal reality in order to do what he

2840.64 --> 2846.72
does i think he's just

2842.4 --> 2850.0
the most incredible designer

2846.72 --> 2851.4399999999996
like a million times better than anybody

2850.0 --> 2854.24
could ever conceive

2851.44 --> 2854.2400000000002
i think that is

2855.44 --> 2858.559
probably a little more logical that it

2858.079 --> 2861.3590000000004
just

2858.559 --> 2863.119
has this device and it's all just

2861.359 --> 2866.16
perfectly mechanically

2863.119 --> 2869.28
arranged and pre-designed in on levels

2866.16 --> 2870.7999999999997
with using this the the rocks effect and

2869.28 --> 2873.28
the natural

2870.8 --> 2874.96
shape and the flow of electricity and

2873.28 --> 2878.0
effects we've probably never even heard

2874.96 --> 2878.0
of i don't know man

2879.2 --> 2882.96
he has it all figured out because he is

2881.359 --> 2886.0
the designer

2882.96 --> 2889.04
of the material realm itself

2886.0 --> 2890.559
of the very concept of matter so yeah

2889.04 --> 2893.839
he's going to be able to

2890.559 --> 2898.1600000000003
design some pretty amazing things

2893.839 --> 2898.16
and the realm is included in that

2898.72 --> 2915.839
and whatever challenges await those who

2901.28 --> 2915.8390000000004
wish to understand more

2926.839 --> 2929.839
so

2954.839 --> 2957.839
well

2968.839 --> 2971.839
okay

2973.28 --> 2976.88
uh iron fe

2975.63 --> 2979.119
[Music]

2976.88 --> 2982.319
it's a complicated question i i can't

2979.119 --> 2984.1600000000003
even be sure at this point

2982.319 --> 2987.44
with the ideas of falling stars and

2984.16 --> 2990.24
meteorites if they're the same phenomena

2987.44 --> 2991.599
phenomenon i don't know they could be

2990.24 --> 2993.839
very different i think that

2991.599 --> 2995.839
like shooting stars on average are

2993.839 --> 2997.359
celestial phenomena they really

2995.839 --> 2998.88
they're bright but they stay out of

2997.359 --> 3001.839
sight so it seems more like a

2998.88 --> 3001.839
holographic thing

3003.119 --> 3011.359
compared to yeah meteorites that really

3008.319 --> 3014.48
have proximity signs and like

3011.359 --> 3016.96
leave [ __ ] and are audible

3014.48 --> 3019.119
that you actually hear it and all that

3016.96 --> 3019.119
so

3020.48 --> 3025.44
i think they're different things and

3023.04 --> 3027.2799999999997
with shooting stars yeah it could go up

3025.44 --> 3028.88
because it's a celestial phenomenon it

3027.28 --> 3031.28
doesn't matter it's

3028.88 --> 3032.559
it's on the globe of the heavens

3031.28 --> 3034.559
projection

3032.559 --> 3041.8390000000004
system so it can go any direction

3034.559 --> 3041.8390000000004
whatever [ __ ] hell it wants

3070.559 --> 3077.2000000000003
ah i forgot what to name my show

3075.599 --> 3078.6400000000003
but anyway i'm bringing all kinds of

3077.2 --> 3080.48
subjects up besides

3078.64 --> 3083.2799999999997
toothpaste i'm definitely not gonna call

3080.48 --> 3086.16
this early bird toothpaste

3083.28 --> 3087.8390000000004
i know i've talked a lot about that some

3086.16 --> 3091.04
interesting things but

3087.839 --> 3097.839
yeah i got five more minutes then i'm

3091.04 --> 3097.839
gonna round out the show

3105.28 --> 3112.0
yeah where's this guy by the way

3108.8 --> 3113.44
missing him i want to give me the paypal

3112.0 --> 3116.0
donation

3113.44 --> 3125.839
martin tolbert haven't seen him in today

3116.0 --> 3125.839
maybe he's too busy

3129.84 --> 3134.2400000000002
[Music]

3132.0 --> 3135.68
yeah electronic three that's really

3134.24 --> 3138.0
interesting even though

3135.68 --> 3141.1189999999997
yeah nobody's ever been alive in order

3138.0 --> 3141.119
to witness that

3143.76 --> 3153.8390000000004
yeah right amanda young it's all right

3148.079 --> 3153.8390000000004
that was pretty good show right

3164.839 --> 3167.839
so

3168.96 --> 3176.48
all right so meet your rights

3172.96 --> 3179.839
comments falling stars what is it all

3176.48 --> 3181.92
are they yeah for to me

3179.839 --> 3184.5589999999997
there's just the two-tier approach one

3181.92 --> 3187.119
is okay i'm gonna have to explain it

3184.559 --> 3189.0400000000004
as part of the holographic celestial

3187.119 --> 3191.359
globe

3189.04 --> 3194.64
does it abide by those rule does it have

3191.359 --> 3198.48
proximity issues

3194.64 --> 3203.2
always angular and all that

3198.48 --> 3205.599
or is it a terrestrial phenomena is it

3203.2 --> 3206.319
actually a physical thing and a location

3205.599 --> 3209.599
and there is

3206.319 --> 3211.599
and there is proximity proof

3209.599 --> 3214.559
that's always for me the distinction and

3211.599 --> 3216.559
yeah with comets

3214.559 --> 3218.7200000000003
it seems very much like a celestial

3216.559 --> 3222.3190000000004
phenomena

3218.72 --> 3225.52
phenomenon uh

3222.319 --> 3228.96
with falling stars it's definitely

3225.52 --> 3232.0
celestial but with meteors

3228.96 --> 3235.119
and they're very much similar to

3232.0 --> 3238.24
yeah to falling stars they

3235.119 --> 3242.559
seem to be physical

3238.24 --> 3245.2
in some way they really are terrestrial

3242.559 --> 3246.88
that's weird that's very mysterious

3245.2 --> 3249.359
because yeah where is that physical

3246.88 --> 3252.6400000000003
object coming from in a realm

3249.359 --> 3255.44
where we got relative density where is

3252.64 --> 3255.44
that coming from

3256.16 --> 3263.52
it seems to be coming from up so

3260.559 --> 3266.0
yeah there's two possible ways or oh

3263.52 --> 3269.2
yeah either it is coming from up there

3266.0 --> 3270.8
in some way either it's gradually formed

3269.2 --> 3272.16
spontaneously formed through

3270.8 --> 3274.7200000000003
transmutation or whatever

3272.16 --> 3277.04
or it's breaking off or it has been it's

3274.72 --> 3280.72
an alternative launched

3277.04 --> 3280.72
from the ground somewhere else

3281.52 --> 3292.24
but that's weird like how

3284.96 --> 3294.4
why from where

3292.24 --> 3296.3999999999996
so that yeah those are the possibilities

3294.4 --> 3300.0
for why an actual physical thing

3296.4 --> 3302.0
a terrestrial phenomenon

3300.0 --> 3303.76
what would be the possibilities with

3302.0 --> 3305.92
that and i by the way did a

3303.76 --> 3307.8390000000004
flat earth talks episode about this as

3305.92 --> 3310.079
well it's very funny how my

3307.839 --> 3313.2
argumentation for all of this has stayed

3310.079 --> 3315.119
very much the same in three and four

3313.2 --> 3318.24
years

3315.119 --> 3323.119
i'm pretty impressed with

3318.24 --> 3323.1189999999997
how i've held together and

3325.359 --> 3331.44
yeah i was able to put all this down

3328.16 --> 3334.5589999999997
much more based on suspicions

3331.44 --> 3337.52
and it turned out that it really

3334.559 --> 3338.88
had grip you know there's very this is

3337.52 --> 3340.72
really weird to me but there's

3338.88 --> 3342.2400000000002
i'm gonna run out to show soon but it's

3340.72 --> 3344.9599999999996
very weird to me that

3342.24 --> 3345.9199999999996
with all the flatter talks that i did

3344.96 --> 3352.079
there were just

3345.92 --> 3355.44
very few cosmogonical related subjects

3352.079 --> 3356.4
that i've been been able to be ashamed

3355.44 --> 3359.44
about and

3356.4 --> 3363.2000000000003
that are completely discarded it's

3359.44 --> 3364.0
very very little it's like everything

3363.2 --> 3366.799
that i did

3364.0 --> 3369.119
three four years ago it kind of still

3366.799 --> 3370.96
stands yes i didn't explain it as well i

3369.119 --> 3374.7200000000003
was a little bit more clumsy

3370.96 --> 3375.119
my vernacular wasn't as refined as it is

3374.72 --> 3378.24
now

3375.119 --> 3381.839
i was less confident but the

3378.24 --> 3383.52
the idea you can definitely hear

3381.839 --> 3385.04
most of the things that i talk about it

3383.52 --> 3388.799
in it

3385.04 --> 3393.04
and yeah i i'm like looking at like whoa

3388.799 --> 3396.16
that is like uncanny how did that happen

3393.04 --> 3398.64
anyway uh

3396.16 --> 3400.72
thanks everyone for coming i hope you

3398.64 --> 3402.48
liked the show i thought it was great

3400.72 --> 3404.0789999999997
