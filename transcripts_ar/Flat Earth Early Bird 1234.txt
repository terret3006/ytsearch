as usual

124.5 --> 129.169
in this time of the month anyway

127.86 --> 132.22899999999998
weather today is

129.169 --> 132.229
[Music]

132.239 --> 135.239
cloudy

135.66 --> 141.06
cloudy it's more like hazy it's just

139.44 --> 143.3
there's some light coming through there

141.06 --> 143.3
but

143.7 --> 148.01999999999998
you can't really even make out where the

145.92 --> 151.099
sun exactly is

148.02 --> 151.09900000000002
behind all this

151.2 --> 155.42
so there seems to be a lot of moist in

153.12 --> 155.42000000000002
the air

155.64 --> 159.2
but hasn't been raining

165.36 --> 169.28
it's still kind of warm though

170.459 --> 173.66
check the temperature

178.14 --> 184.07999999999998
hello Matthew Hall first in chat Neil

180.78 --> 185.76
deGrasse Tyson lies pjc net good to see

184.08 --> 187.26000000000002
you all

185.76 --> 192.89999999999998
it is

187.26 --> 192.89999999999998
Thursday the 5th of May 2022.

206.7 --> 209.23899999999998
ah

209.879 --> 215.28
yeah

211.68 --> 217.799
I'm very very well rested

215.28 --> 221.18
cleaning up

217.799 --> 221.18
almost really necessary

226.019 --> 232.439
yeah I keep forgetting sometimes I tend

229.019 --> 235.439
to like minimize things like showering

232.439 --> 238.07999999999998
like specifically to stay away from the

235.439 --> 241.26
habit of doing that every single day

238.08 --> 242.81900000000002
because it's just not good for my lymph

241.26 --> 245.599
system I guess

242.819 --> 245.599
and

246.0 --> 252.36
sometimes when I'm in like physical

248.459 --> 254.4
recovery from ailments my jaw situation

252.36 --> 257.48
all that I forget like yeah you actually

254.4 --> 257.48
need to shower more

257.54 --> 264.0
it's more than usual because your body's

261.419 --> 266.58
gonna throw out a lot of

264.0 --> 269.16
stuff

266.58 --> 271.979
and it yeah it's it's much better to

269.16 --> 274.58000000000004
just shower that out

271.979 --> 274.58
anyway

283.56 --> 289.8
pretty well rested a bit hungry did not

286.62 --> 293.36
get like a song or anything before this

289.8 --> 293.36
nor went out for groceries

298.979 --> 301.979
hmm

306.84 --> 312.17999999999995
right

308.4 --> 315.13899999999995
so yesterday's Flat Earth debate

312.18 --> 315.139
it's pretty good

315.6 --> 320.1
it's more rolling on the same subject it

318.24 --> 322.56
and

320.1 --> 324.53900000000004
more people coming in

322.56 --> 329.36
coming back for more

324.539 --> 329.36
so ether is on the menu it seems

332.4 --> 338.75899999999996
but yeah there's plenty to keep

334.68 --> 341.46
discussing about with that

338.759 --> 345.38
uh

341.46 --> 345.38
all right what else

349.199 --> 354.44
made by Jim Bob again

351.36 --> 354.44
always good stuff

363.06 --> 369.18
and I do realize that one of these days

365.22 --> 370.74
I'm just gonna have to get on this show

369.18 --> 372.96
just like that

370.74 --> 375.36
I've noticed that I'm I'm being nervous

372.96 --> 376.79999999999995
about it because it is kind of late to

375.36 --> 379.5
me and

376.8 --> 382.08
like during that time yeah I've had a

379.5 --> 385.56
few beers and all that

382.08 --> 388.28
so I won't be as like as pristine as I

385.56 --> 391.38
am here right on the show right now

388.28 --> 394.13899999999995
comparatively and that's the thing that

391.38 --> 398.15999999999997
makes me nervous right but

394.139 --> 400.62
I know I could trust you involved

398.16 --> 403.259
but he is a good guy he's not like gonna

400.62 --> 405.78000000000003
shame me or anything you might want to

403.259 --> 407.28000000000003
remind me like something like hey would

405.78 --> 410.71999999999997
you want to do more with your life right

407.28 --> 410.71999999999997
but that's to be expected

411.24 --> 416.099
that's actually a good thing

413.94 --> 418.68
uh but yeah

416.099 --> 423.02
I should just get on there

418.68 --> 423.02
sometime just just to try it out and

423.66 --> 427.22
I've been wanting to for a while

431.039 --> 435.919
to my put out a new song

433.259 --> 435.91900000000004
you did

440.039 --> 442.94
he

445.5 --> 452.46
I know he's been trying to play like

448.38 --> 454.62
some clip from with Ben Shapiro on there

452.46 --> 456.62
a cartoon of him but he couldn't get the

454.62 --> 459.84000000000003
volume to work

456.62 --> 461.46
other than that I haven't seen any new

459.84 --> 464.78
song

461.46 --> 464.78
not yesterday anyway

477.419 --> 479.96
hmm

481.8 --> 485.0
any club Ruckus

501.94 --> 505.62
[Music]

503.58 --> 508.5
right

505.62 --> 510.72
anyway I've been thinking a lot

508.5 --> 513.24
dream walking thinking

510.72 --> 515.94
a lot about just

513.24 --> 518.339
like what people do with their online

515.94 --> 519.899
activities what you guys are sort of

518.339 --> 522.1800000000001
doing

519.899 --> 523.68
using my show like I'm trying to figure

522.18 --> 526.5
it out

523.68 --> 529.8
uh but I do think that

526.5 --> 532.08
for example me now starting to call my

529.8 --> 534.68
chat a workshop I think that's really

532.08 --> 534.6800000000001
effective

535.56 --> 539.6999999999999
like

537.06 --> 543.26
that is really like

539.7 --> 543.26
yes like the the

544.5 --> 549.3
energy

546.54 --> 552.18
related to the energy that

549.3 --> 554.399
that's what it's supposed to be right

552.18 --> 556.3199999999999
and you guys all know like through the

554.399 --> 558.24
mechanism through my interactions like

556.32 --> 562.08
hey yeah yeah

558.24 --> 563.64
like you have to like spark the Kindle

562.08 --> 566.4590000000001
that's there and then the Fire gets

563.64 --> 568.3199999999999
going and then I get going

566.459 --> 569.5799999999999
right

568.32 --> 572.1
and

569.58 --> 574.38
yeah

572.1 --> 576.4200000000001
when you look at those types of

574.38 --> 578.82
interaction mechanics well that is

576.42 --> 581.54
typically what does what happened in

578.82 --> 581.5400000000001
workshops

583.38 --> 589.279
right so it's just constant esoteric

586.44 --> 589.2790000000001
comparing

589.38 --> 596.6
of just words with situations that

592.56 --> 596.5999999999999
people can associate with literally

597.12 --> 604.079
right own Benjamin has done this

600.0 --> 605.1
very refinedly I wonder if at the at the

604.079 --> 607.38
first

605.1 --> 609.48
like he really had a plan for it or

607.38 --> 612.66
whether it just kind he stumbled upon it

609.48 --> 615.74
and he just made it

612.66 --> 618.36
it just built it

615.74 --> 620.339
spontaneously and it worked out great I

618.36 --> 623.399
don't I don't know if he like really had

620.339 --> 626.6600000000001
a plan ahead of time that he was then

623.399 --> 626.66
enrolling I'm not sure

626.76 --> 632.12
he does talk about it so it doesn't seem

629.279 --> 632.12
like it it's so

632.279 --> 638.3389999999999
like a bear community

635.579 --> 639.2399999999999
relating just to like building your

638.339 --> 642.0
thing

639.24 --> 644.88
building your skill

642.0 --> 647.519
and then providing Services providing

644.88 --> 650.9399999999999
food and making like a community out of

647.519 --> 654.66
enthusiasm for that setup

650.94 --> 658.1600000000001
and then associating that with bears

654.66 --> 658.16
like that's

658.8 --> 664.1999999999999
like the names and the associations do

662.16 --> 666.0
matter

664.2 --> 668.339
right

666.0 --> 673.2
it's interesting to me

668.339 --> 676.74
oh that works the the names you give

673.2 --> 679.38
your community or activities

676.74 --> 680.22
that with those communities that you

679.38 --> 682.68
like

680.22 --> 686.6
give them proper format you give them a

682.68 --> 686.5999999999999
proper name that will

687.66 --> 693.48
Inspire and derive those that engage

690.48 --> 695.88
towards the right frequency Associated

693.48 --> 698.76
typically associated with that

695.88 --> 702.779
it's like the right name will tell

698.76 --> 706.019
people what to do on an intuitive level

702.779 --> 708.72
especially if you're like in the flow

706.019 --> 710.639
it's interesting to me that look I

708.72 --> 714.24
constantly am puzzling in my head it's

710.639 --> 715.98
like oh Arwin is just oh smoking and

714.24 --> 720.6
drinking and watching

715.98 --> 722.4590000000001
videos all night or all evening and just

720.6 --> 726.899
walking around like oh he's wasting his

722.459 --> 728.5999999999999
time yeah well I actually use that time

726.899 --> 732.54
for like

728.6 --> 735.839
complicated processing of this types of

732.54 --> 740.06
thing right figuring everything out

735.839 --> 740.0600000000001
takes a lot of rendering time

740.58 --> 745.44
[Music]

742.8 --> 748.5
there's it's a couple of bad at bad

745.44 --> 750.86
associations over yeah of course those

748.5 --> 750.86
two

751.98 --> 754.5790000000001
what

755.72 --> 762.94
all right I almost forgot

759.77 --> 762.9399999999999
[Music]

767.579 --> 772.5
yeah there was a funny situation

770.279 --> 777.2
yesterday on fvd I almost forgot that

772.5 --> 777.2
the rasta had just reminded me and Skype

777.839 --> 783.1800000000001
that

779.579 --> 786.12
Alex Steen got on the show and he

783.18 --> 788.0999999999999
trolled and I recognized his voice in

786.12 --> 789.6
the way he was talking like that's Alex

788.1 --> 792.48
Steen isn't it

789.6 --> 794.88
but he never like said yes

792.48 --> 798.24
so then we thought I thought maybe it's

794.88 --> 801.86
somebody it like imitating him

798.24 --> 801.86
but it was just him

801.959 --> 808.16
and I was first to recognize it though

804.12 --> 808.16
like that's Alex Stevens

809.459 --> 814.6199999999999
yeah don't know if anybody picked up on

811.56 --> 818.66
that or if it wasn't like the after show

814.62 --> 818.66
then you'll see it soon enough

819.48 --> 821.6
um

824.38 --> 827.519
[Music]

830.88 --> 832.88
um

840.3 --> 844.0999999999999
hello terminal 2.

844.38 --> 847.519
ladder Sage

860.19 --> 864.4290000000001
[Music]

867.24 --> 875.339
Alex definitely been crushing it lately

870.779 --> 880.62
yeah well the guy has incredible energy

875.339 --> 884.2790000000001
like manic energy and he's really

880.62 --> 886.4590000000001
is really saddling it up he's like using

884.279 --> 886.459
it

887.519 --> 892.44
so yeah crushing it

889.74 --> 895.019
very well I was kind of nervous at first

892.44 --> 896.6990000000001
like okay isn't he gonna like grow out

895.019 --> 898.32
of control

896.699 --> 901.079
but

898.32 --> 903.86
the way he grows out of control seems to

901.079 --> 903.8599999999999
be under control

904.199 --> 911.18
it has a very refined system

907.62 --> 911.18
and it is hilarious

932.92 --> 936.74
[Music]

934.259 --> 936.74
hmm

938.04 --> 942.36
right so yeah that also happened I

940.38 --> 945.199
almost forgot about that

942.36 --> 945.1990000000001
uh

946.199 --> 952.8599999999999
right

948.54 --> 956.7199999999999
watch the own Benjamin from yesterday

952.86 --> 956.72
only a small part of it

957.24 --> 960.139
and that's about it

961.44 --> 965.6
right so I'm pretty much open

965.759 --> 970.1
for discussion in all kinds of

967.86 --> 970.1
directions

972.24 --> 976.0790000000001
Flat Earth mechanics

978.68 --> 985.459
historical aspects trying to figure out

982.079 --> 985.459
what really happened in the past

989.399 --> 996.54
or Community gossip if you guys want to

993.48 --> 999.899
talk about that and that's fine

996.54 --> 1002.48
as long as it doesn't just get too gross

999.899 --> 1004.579
huh

1002.48 --> 1006.1990000000001
what happened the anti-flatter there's

1004.579 --> 1008.5999999999999
been up to

1006.199 --> 1013.04
more stupid double speak thing and

1008.6 --> 1017.0
denial and gaslighting at homs

1013.04 --> 1019.7199999999999
so yeah that kind of summarizes all that

1017.0 --> 1019.72
uh

1020.779 --> 1029.299
oh that's right yeah there's political

1024.679 --> 1032.5
and United States I think it's

1029.299 --> 1032.5
it's interesting

1032.6 --> 1037.6399999999999
but

1034.28 --> 1042.079
yeah it's already kind of apparent like

1037.64 --> 1044.0590000000002
people like that are super promotional

1042.079 --> 1046.1599999999999
are effectively already revealing

1044.059 --> 1048.459
exactly what they do and it's just like

1046.16 --> 1048.459
okay

1048.5 --> 1053.12
there will be this liberal fanatical

1050.72 --> 1055.34
funded system where anybody that wants

1053.12 --> 1056.6
an abortion will just get like a free

1055.34 --> 1059.1789999999999
flight

1056.6 --> 1061.82
and get it all for free

1059.179 --> 1065.299
it's like abortion socialism that that

1061.82 --> 1067.9399999999998
seems to be like what the

1065.299 --> 1070.4
the counter side to that to that

1067.94 --> 1072.559
situation with the overthrowing of the

1070.4 --> 1076.0
Court's decision

1072.559 --> 1076.0
based on the testimony

1077.48 --> 1083.24
Roe versus Wade

1080.6 --> 1086.12
yeah they seem to be saying that now so

1083.24 --> 1088.28
like it's not gonna go away guys just by

1086.12 --> 1091.9399999999998
making it illegal doesn't make these

1088.28 --> 1095.26
demons stop getting more demonic

1091.94 --> 1095.26
got to realize that

1095.6 --> 1100.059
anyway

1097.28 --> 1100.059
uh-huh

1100.1 --> 1104.6599999999999
but yeah a whole bunch of people that

1102.02 --> 1107.95
are like super pro-life and I'm not even

1104.66 --> 1109.52
shaming that I really am not

1107.95 --> 1111.98
[Music]

1109.52 --> 1115.1
I like I like to in general stay

1111.98 --> 1118.88
completely out of it because it's like

1115.1 --> 1121.6399999999999
it's so polarizing the entire situation

1118.88 --> 1124.1000000000001
I used to be when I was much younger

1121.64 --> 1127.5800000000002
like sort of like

1124.1 --> 1129.9189999999999
yeah I don't want to like ruin people's

1127.58 --> 1131.1789999999999
lives

1129.919 --> 1134.66
right

1131.179 --> 1136.7
if they if they don't

1134.66 --> 1138.5
think or like they don't want a child

1136.7 --> 1141.02
then they don't right it was just being

1138.5 --> 1143.96
very pragmatic but basic and not

1141.02 --> 1147.2
realizing even like the Interdynamics of

1143.96 --> 1149.96
how people work and that

1147.2 --> 1151.5800000000002
actually getting the child anyway might

1149.96 --> 1153.98
really change your life for the better

1151.58 --> 1157.58
like it might turn your mind around

1153.98 --> 1160.9
right all these things I was very

1157.58 --> 1160.8999999999999
funny informed about

1165.2 --> 1170.059
so these days it's like yeah I am

1168.2 --> 1174.14
pro-life but

1170.059 --> 1175.6399999999999
I only it's for me like I decide to be

1174.14 --> 1178.3400000000001
like that

1175.64 --> 1181.46
I've even like settled like yeah maybe

1178.34 --> 1183.559
sex just it shouldn't be even the

1181.46 --> 1185.6000000000001
priority like that

1183.559 --> 1189.9189999999999
like

1185.6 --> 1192.8799999999999
building trust and connection and just

1189.919 --> 1195.8600000000001
finding ways to

1192.88 --> 1197.9
invigorate bring out more energy with

1195.86 --> 1199.2199999999998
each other is like more important and

1197.9 --> 1201.2
then

1199.22 --> 1203.3600000000001
like because then if you get to that

1201.2 --> 1206.48
point then

1203.36 --> 1209.1789999999999
getting children will be like a good

1206.48 --> 1210.799
idea then you have the foundation and

1209.179 --> 1212.299
then why would you even consider

1210.799 --> 1214.46
abortion because it's not a hopeless

1212.299 --> 1215.6589999999999
situation that certainly arrived out of

1214.46 --> 1218.539
nowhere because you just went into

1215.659 --> 1220.5800000000002
square right didn't actually think about

1218.539 --> 1223.299
building up

1220.58 --> 1223.299
so

1226.82 --> 1232.84
right but yeah those people that are

1229.76 --> 1236.32
like super pro version again

1232.84 --> 1236.32
that's like

1239.84 --> 1243.799
gross

1241.46 --> 1246.2
sick

1243.799 --> 1247.76
that's just insane those people are

1246.2 --> 1249.88
crazy

1247.76 --> 1252.98
like

1249.88 --> 1255.0800000000002
arguably dangerous

1252.98 --> 1256.76
I mean they literally want to kill

1255.08 --> 1259.8799999999999
babies

1256.76 --> 1262.039
I mean isn't that harm to another

1259.88 --> 1265.1000000000001
you know

1262.039 --> 1267.08
I mean the way they're dealing it doing

1265.1 --> 1269.84
it and they're pushing it it's not

1267.08 --> 1272.12
really about like oh I I want to

1269.84 --> 1273.98
maintain the life that I was having

1272.12 --> 1276.02
before I suddenly got pregnant it's like

1273.98 --> 1277.82
no it's not even about that anymore to

1276.02 --> 1280.6399999999999
them right

1277.82 --> 1283.1
that the the Cornerstone option which

1280.64 --> 1284.659
requires the freedom the old liberal

1283.1 --> 1286.52
approach they don't give a [ __ ] about

1284.659 --> 1288.919
that anymore no they

1286.52 --> 1292.6399999999999
just wanted

1288.919 --> 1293.659
let their Madness and bloodlust Feast

1292.64 --> 1295.8200000000002
now

1293.659 --> 1298.7
crazy

1295.82 --> 1300.86
like that has it's not even about really

1298.7 --> 1303.44
abortion anymore it's just about these

1300.86 --> 1306.1399999999999
people hijacking abortion

1303.44 --> 1309.26
defeat their bloodlust

1306.14 --> 1311.8600000000001
God forbid maybe literal

1309.26 --> 1311.86
ugh

1324.26 --> 1328.24
Bill Hicks bro life lessons

1328.4 --> 1334.5800000000002
how about rape victims here see yeah but

1331.64 --> 1337.7
but logical conclusion when you ask what

1334.58 --> 1341.0
about rape victims now you're actually

1337.7 --> 1343.88
talking about real situation and whether

1341.0 --> 1346.1
abortion should be criminalized right

1343.88 --> 1349.22
because what if we just had a

1346.1 --> 1353.1399999999999
decriminalization policy for abortion

1349.22 --> 1353.14
instead of full legalization

1354.02 --> 1360.62
because then it can't be exploited by

1357.799 --> 1364.22
Commerce in any way

1360.62 --> 1367.4599999999998
and arguably not by politics either

1364.22 --> 1368.84
because it's technically not legal see I

1367.46 --> 1371.48
don't know maybe this is too

1368.84 --> 1373.3999999999999
revolutionary or something or or it

1371.48 --> 1375.799
doesn't work I don't know I it I just

1373.4 --> 1378.3400000000001
came up with that

1375.799 --> 1378.34
but

1378.74 --> 1384.14
right murdering a baby doesn't fix the

1380.96 --> 1388.52
rape that is also technically true

1384.14 --> 1392.0
but yeah the problem is not even like oh

1388.52 --> 1393.9189999999999
allowed not allowed it's about

1392.0 --> 1396.74
the people

1393.919 --> 1399.14
to which it actually applies

1396.74 --> 1403.88
and a lot of people that are like

1399.14 --> 1408.3200000000002
pro-abortion they don't care about

1403.88 --> 1412.3400000000001
your right to abort they want

1408.32 --> 1414.62
they want like the murder part

1412.34 --> 1419.08
and they might have not started out like

1414.62 --> 1419.08
that but they became like that

1419.84 --> 1424.76
they emphasized that and now yeah you

1422.179 --> 1426.76
could say they've become that

1424.76 --> 1431.14
it's a terrible

1426.76 --> 1431.14
metamorphosis of the spirit

1432.44 --> 1436.46
right I think that's a much bigger

1434.9 --> 1439.22
problem than

1436.46 --> 1441.02
like the r the endless political

1439.22 --> 1445.1000000000001
controversy of

1441.02 --> 1447.799
pro-life Pro Choice seriously

1445.1 --> 1450.08
because like because even oh they now

1447.799 --> 1453.08
it's illegal oh that means it goes away

1450.08 --> 1456.02
no no it doesn't

1453.08 --> 1459.34
it just moves the problem

1456.02 --> 1459.34
to another area

1459.62 --> 1462.1
right

1462.32 --> 1468.4399999999998
that's why in general I I prioritize to

1466.22 --> 1471.98
stay away from the subject but yeah it

1468.44 --> 1473.659
is currently going around it's gonna be

1471.98 --> 1476.74
on a lot of people's minds so I might

1473.659 --> 1476.74
just as well address it

1477.62 --> 1481.84
hey rest ahead good to see you by the

1479.72 --> 1481.84
way

1487.039 --> 1491.5
wow yeah Matthew Hall yeah it's amazing

1495.559 --> 1501.82
right

1497.14 --> 1501.8200000000002
it's all about the decision and

1502.34 --> 1507.32
like let's just say like how many people

1505.46 --> 1509.9
do you know about

1507.32 --> 1512.48
that didn't have an abortion because

1509.9 --> 1515.539
they were raped or something and then

1512.48 --> 1517.88
they're like my life is now [ __ ]

1515.539 --> 1519.86
and it has been for a long time right

1517.88 --> 1522.2
how many people like that do you

1519.86 --> 1524.84
actually know that actually

1522.2 --> 1528.0800000000002
didn't get an abortion and then they're

1524.84 --> 1531.9189999999999
like my life is screwed now

1528.08 --> 1533.8999999999999
like maybe the first week of panic said

1531.919 --> 1538.4
you but like after they had the kid

1533.9 --> 1539.659
right let's just say two three five ten

1538.4 --> 1542.299
years later

1539.659 --> 1544.1000000000001
how how many of those people do you know

1542.299 --> 1547.6399999999999
that are like yeah my life was screwed

1544.1 --> 1549.08
over if only abortion was legalized how

1547.64 --> 1550.1000000000001
many do you actually know of those

1549.08 --> 1553.76
people

1550.1 --> 1557.8999999999999
I've never met a single one

1553.76 --> 1561.26
That Couldn't like present that

1557.9 --> 1563.9
it's like once they like become a mother

1561.26 --> 1565.24
they all become pro-life naturally

1563.9 --> 1568.5800000000002
because

1565.24 --> 1571.46
they figured it out

1568.58 --> 1574.58
they figure it out like the reward like

1571.46 --> 1577.22
the reward to like your spirit of just

1574.58 --> 1579.559
doing that going for it or just getting

1577.22 --> 1582.1000000000001
the child

1579.559 --> 1582.1
right

1588.62 --> 1593.299
right there's plenty of stories of women

1591.26 --> 1596.12
having abortions and then end up having

1593.299 --> 1598.52
regrets there's plenty of those

1596.12 --> 1600.559
how about the other way around

1598.52 --> 1602.539
how many of those people do you know

1600.559 --> 1603.98
that actually did get the kids and then

1602.539 --> 1608.6589999999999
have regrets

1603.98 --> 1611.1200000000001
that weren't just an unbearable whiny

1608.659 --> 1613.72
blabbler

1611.12 --> 1616.039
all their lives even before right

1613.72 --> 1617.96
because yeah there's gonna be people

1616.039 --> 1619.7
that will always complain about whatever

1617.96 --> 1621.679
they've been through no matter what it

1619.7 --> 1625.159
is of course

1621.679 --> 1627.14
but beside those people

1625.159 --> 1629.179
and when you're just normal people do

1627.14 --> 1631.039
you know that did get the kid even

1629.179 --> 1634.22
though they they thought they wanted an

1631.039 --> 1638.62
abortion and then afterward they regret

1634.22 --> 1638.6200000000001
it how many of those do you know

1641.0 --> 1644.14
I don't know any

1651.62 --> 1658.6589999999999
huh okay Neil deGrasse Tyson lies heavy

1655.7 --> 1658.659
heavy sorry

1661.279 --> 1665.32
that's

1662.6 --> 1665.32
poof

1666.919 --> 1669.46
right

1670.039 --> 1673.12
well I

1674.36 --> 1678.5
I don't think I ever like caused an

1676.58 --> 1681.08
abortion

1678.5 --> 1684.799
like all the girls were always like on

1681.08 --> 1687.46
the pill or something or I used condoms

1684.799 --> 1687.46
so

1688.76 --> 1694.48
it's weird because I almost like regret

1691.279 --> 1694.48
that like I wish

1695.539 --> 1702.22
it's just too

1697.36 --> 1702.2199999999998
preoccupied with my own inner world

1706.94 --> 1712.46
but yeah there were definitely some of

1708.86 --> 1714.26
my exes where I'm like I wish I would

1712.46 --> 1717.3400000000001
have been able to like

1714.26 --> 1717.34
convince them

1717.679 --> 1722.299
right because when I really love a woman

1720.08 --> 1724.46
then I absolutely this natural then I

1722.299 --> 1726.1399999999999
want children with them I want to lock

1724.46 --> 1730.539
in

1726.14 --> 1730.539
want to die with my ex too but yeah

1731.12 --> 1734.62
it doesn't happen a lot

1735.2 --> 1737.919
it

1738.98 --> 1744.58
you think the world could use more

1741.2 --> 1744.5800000000002
arwins you do really

1744.74 --> 1748.24
could use more guys

1748.46 --> 1751.419
like me

1751.7 --> 1755.1200000000001
I mean

1753.2 --> 1758.0
what would that do

1755.12 --> 1759.9799999999998
it's not like weird like our wins are

1758.0 --> 1763.64
like the most

1759.98 --> 1765.82
outfully productive type of humans or

1763.64 --> 1765.8200000000002
something

1767.299 --> 1773.12
most of my activities really take place

1770.419 --> 1776.179
in in the mind

1773.12 --> 1778.4599999999998
in my own mind and other people's minds

1776.179 --> 1780.26
it's just that I've I'm noticing like

1778.46 --> 1784.22
yeah that's actually important that's

1780.26 --> 1786.559
why I'm sort of a Layman psychologist

1784.22 --> 1788.3600000000001
because of the realization like yeah if

1786.559 --> 1790.46
you only focus on the physical world

1788.36 --> 1793.039
things then

1790.46 --> 1795.559
who's take who's got control of that

1793.039 --> 1796.82
mind right

1795.559 --> 1800.299
so

1796.82 --> 1804.3799999999999
if we can fix people's minds as I fixed

1800.299 --> 1807.399
my own in many ways throughout my life

1804.38 --> 1810.74
then maybe that can be a productivity

1807.399 --> 1812.779
would it help to have a lot of our wins

1810.74 --> 1815.559
around

1812.779 --> 1815.559
I don't know

1821.179 --> 1825.8200000000002
I think we'd all be very annoyed with

1823.399 --> 1825.82
one another

1826.279 --> 1835.24
because it's like oh my God not another

1828.559 --> 1835.24
one of you of me oh [ __ ] oh Jesus right

1836.899 --> 1841.4189999999999
I don't know I don't know what I'm

1839.0 --> 1841.419
talking about

1842.96 --> 1846.22
playing into it

1847.039 --> 1853.12
figure of speech a joke from somebody uh

1853.58 --> 1857.74
our winds annoyed yeah you bet yeah

1858.559 --> 1865.519
I mean especially when I'm being me

1862.22 --> 1869.8600000000001
I mean when I'm like doing my show I

1865.519 --> 1869.86
have a certain position like I'm

1870.74 --> 1876.019
I'm in a certain role it's very very

1873.62 --> 1876.799
doable I like myself when I watch my

1876.019 --> 1879.14
show

1876.799 --> 1881.4189999999999
when I listen to myself sometimes on the

1879.14 --> 1883.1000000000001
Flat Earth debate I I'm have a different

1881.419 --> 1887.2990000000002
role

1883.1 --> 1889.6399999999999
I much more of like the kid in class

1887.299 --> 1892.399
and yeah that gets kind of annoying even

1889.64 --> 1895.64
to me when I listen back and I make good

1892.399 --> 1898.12
points it's just like oh my God here he

1895.64 --> 1898.1200000000001
goes again

1899.12 --> 1904.279
right

1901.7 --> 1907.82
and I bet some people have that when I

1904.279 --> 1909.86
do like some sort of a Ballwin thing

1907.82 --> 1911.24
because it is an Impulse it is being

1909.86 --> 1913.82
cheeky

1911.24 --> 1918.08
right but I all do it for learning

1913.82 --> 1920.779
purposes for studying learning purposes

1918.08 --> 1922.039
but it still can be annoying to see even

1920.779 --> 1924.32
for me

1922.039 --> 1926.799
when I'm watching it back

1924.32 --> 1926.799
right

1934.58 --> 1936.76
foreign

1946.24 --> 1950.059
yeah

1947.779 --> 1953.24
yeah nearly rest I'm just really happy

1950.059 --> 1955.72
for you that you have a daughter

1953.24 --> 1955.72
right

1956.179 --> 1962.8400000000001
it's like the minor thing that happened

1959.36 --> 1965.36
where you asked for an abortion

1962.84 --> 1968.36
or you have a daughter to make that up

1965.36 --> 1971.299
with not like you should like panic over

1968.36 --> 1973.4799999999998
it but it's like Jeff the daughter you

1971.299 --> 1973.48
can

1973.64 --> 1978.2
every time you you feel like oh [ __ ] I

1976.399 --> 1980.6589999999999
did that it's like but you got a

1978.2 --> 1982.039
daughter you can make it up right now if

1980.659 --> 1984.3990000000001
you want it

1982.039 --> 1984.399
right

1986.539 --> 1992.019
so it just yeah I'm happy for you

1994.159 --> 2001.019
must be frustrating for me Arwin what

1997.58 --> 2001.019
but what must be

2007.84 --> 2012.22
right and and by the way Neil deGrasse

2010.059 --> 2014.74
ties lies I've had

2012.22 --> 2019.8990000000001
comparable situations

2014.74 --> 2021.82
I mean when I was younger I was like

2019.899 --> 2025.1789999999999
very

2021.82 --> 2027.279
like unsympathetic and cold about like

2025.179 --> 2029.3200000000002
the whole thing of abortion like I

2027.279 --> 2032.98
didn't really

2029.32 --> 2037.32
even think of it as like this super

2032.98 --> 2037.32
impactful thing like I didn't

2037.539 --> 2043.26
like I

2039.76 --> 2043.26
I guess that yeah

2044.2 --> 2051.46
what never happened in relation to me or

2047.019 --> 2054.399
somebody that I know or that I knew

2051.46 --> 2056.139
and so I was kind of Reckless with it

2054.399 --> 2057.7
that if somebody talked about him like

2056.139 --> 2060.3990000000003
yeah well what's the problem just get an

2057.7 --> 2064.5989999999997
abortion it's done and I was like to

2060.399 --> 2067.359
sloppy right it's it's very typical

2064.599 --> 2070.26
a young mind's thinking I guess

2067.359 --> 2073.72
I do feel guilty about that like how

2070.26 --> 2075.639
just like it's casual and not like oh

2073.72 --> 2077.859
just kill it and just be dark about it

2075.639 --> 2080.379
but just like no it doesn't matter like

2077.859 --> 2082.06
not realizing how much impact that

2080.379 --> 2084.5789999999997
really does have

2082.06 --> 2086.98
you'll get guilty about that sometimes

2084.579 --> 2089.52
because I was like that in my teens

2086.98 --> 2089.52
especially

2091.96 --> 2098.44
I guess it's when like the the impulses

2095.619 --> 2101.079
of wanting to be a father

2098.44 --> 2103.2400000000002
which came a bit later I think they kind

2101.079 --> 2105.579
of started to enter when it was 20.

2103.24 --> 2108.7599999999998
really that's when I really got those

2105.579 --> 2113.3390000000004
feelings and started to notice it

2108.76 --> 2113.3390000000004
when I like started to realize like yeah

2113.74 --> 2118.6189999999997
maybe I should take all this a little

2115.72 --> 2118.6189999999997
bit more serious

2122.14 --> 2124.56
anyway

2127.54 --> 2130.68
what's that break back

2131.92 --> 2137.6800000000003
right so yeah aren't your fish any

2135.18 --> 2140.0989999999997
clarification exactly what you're

2137.68 --> 2140.0989999999997
talking about

2143.68 --> 2149.2799999999997
claiming gas pressure without

2145.48 --> 2149.28
containment drink back oh dear

2157.079 --> 2162.3
I'll bet you you use the container

2165.46 --> 2169.14
always Jim Bob video

2175.0 --> 2181.0
all right yeah I remember now yeah yeah

2177.82 --> 2182.98
it's so weird I I was there

2181.0 --> 2185.32
I was there I've been chatting in

2182.98 --> 2189.66
comment section

2185.32 --> 2189.6600000000003
let's just slipped my mind yeah that guy

2195.28 --> 2203.44
magnet it went completely ape [ __ ]

2200.02 --> 2204.94
like have you have you guys like seen my

2203.44 --> 2207.9
comments in the

2204.94 --> 2207.9
in the chat

2208.839 --> 2215.38
because I was definitely trying to guide

2211.42 --> 2217.359
Jim Bob like with condensed Flat Earth

2215.38 --> 2221.2200000000003
debate lore

2217.359 --> 2221.22
right I was doing my thing

2222.46 --> 2228.0
in the chat

2224.2 --> 2228.0
I hope Jim Bob was reading it

2228.16 --> 2231.2999999999997
he probably was

2236.619 --> 2241.8
ah okay art your fists show no

2239.2 --> 2241.7999999999997
clarification

2242.8 --> 2246.94
that's it

2244.42 --> 2251.4
must be frustrating

2246.94 --> 2251.4
I don't know what what fine

2253.9 --> 2260.88
magnets inside the container yeah

2257.04 --> 2260.88
it's ridiculous

2269.32 --> 2276.54
I mean obviously the guy hasn't done

2272.74 --> 2279.339
actual like physics tests

2276.54 --> 2282.339
concerning gas pressure Dynamics and

2279.339 --> 2284.02
turbulence like obviously he he didn't

2282.339 --> 2285.82
actually know what he was talking about

2284.02 --> 2287.56
and he was just

2285.82 --> 2290.5
trying

2287.56 --> 2292.42
to puzzle it out based on heliocentric

2290.5 --> 2294.4
presuppositions

2292.42 --> 2296.7400000000002
so what he was doing it that's what

2294.4 --> 2298.9
people do

2296.74 --> 2300.8199999999997
and they're all believers and I think he

2298.9 --> 2304.2000000000003
was a ball believer I don't think he was

2300.82 --> 2304.2000000000003
an anti-flat earther really

2323.5 --> 2326.5
mm-hmm

2343.06 --> 2347.38
all right it's hilarious

2345.82 --> 2349.839
I mean

2347.38 --> 2351.579
there's still some maneuvering room for

2349.839 --> 2353.619
Baldwin even to do a whole bunch of

2351.579 --> 2356.44
things but at this point like I feel

2353.619 --> 2359.7400000000002
like I'm not gonna do that anymore I've

2356.44 --> 2362.38
already suggested a couple of things

2359.74 --> 2367.1189999999997
it's just

2362.38 --> 2370.0
the world's not ready for the true ball

2367.119 --> 2372.2200000000003
Earth model that does account for gas

2370.0 --> 2375.4
pressure and

2372.22 --> 2378.339
like that yeah I would even like go as

2375.4 --> 2381.099
far as to basically figure out

2378.339 --> 2384.04
what space-time bending gravity actually

2381.099 --> 2387.88
is and does in the Physical Realm

2384.04 --> 2391.0
of course it would all be a reification

2387.88 --> 2392.2000000000003
but at this point what does it matter

2391.0 --> 2395.16
right

2392.2 --> 2398.3199999999997
I can make it believable

2395.16 --> 2401.7599999999998
right but they'll have none of that over

2398.32 --> 2401.76
at the Flat Earth debate of course

2402.16 --> 2406.56
like Nathan doesn't like it when I do

2404.319 --> 2406.56
that

2406.78 --> 2413.0400000000004
I'm not even sure if I like it when I do

2409.0 --> 2413.04
that it's just that I can

2416.92 --> 2421.5
how do I catch prey

2421.54 --> 2426.18
are you an English person archerfish

2432.819 --> 2435.839
seem to

2437.44 --> 2444.0
have some

2440.28 --> 2444.0
communication issues

2453.48 --> 2459.94
atmospheric pressure is not a problem

2456.819 --> 2462.88
yeah it is you know why because gas

2459.94 --> 2465.2200000000003
takes the shape of its container

2462.88 --> 2467.92
it doesn't naturally

2465.22 --> 2470.2
take the shape of a sphere unless

2467.92 --> 2472.9
there's a physical container that is

2470.2 --> 2476.3999999999996
sphere shaped

2472.9 --> 2476.4
on which it can press

2479.079 --> 2484.96
huh

2481.54 --> 2487.3
so atmosphere is a presupposition

2484.96 --> 2489.88
the presupposition being that the Earth

2487.3 --> 2494.7000000000003
is a sphere and that the gas accumulates

2489.88 --> 2498.839
around it in spherical fashion

2494.7 --> 2498.839
so it is a problem

2503.52 --> 2508.3
uh we're seeking star water when you

2506.5 --> 2511.68
need her to

2508.3 --> 2511.6800000000003
do the darp alert

2515.2 --> 2520.06
[Music]

2523.69 --> 2530.04
[Music]

2526.54 --> 2530.04
ah there you are

2546.79 --> 2549.96
[Music]

2553.54 --> 2557.44
[Music]

2554.98 --> 2559.78
it's weird you know it's like

2557.44 --> 2561.4
letters the early bird show chat is like

2559.78 --> 2565.42
my workshop

2561.4 --> 2568.7200000000003
and sometimes like the fauna just comes

2565.42 --> 2571.0
walking in right the natural fauna

2568.72 --> 2573.0989999999997
spiritual fauna

2571.0 --> 2574.96
of what we deal with the subjects that

2573.099 --> 2577.839
we deal with and then the fauna that's

2574.96 --> 2580.42
just like doesn't have any grip on what

2577.839 --> 2582.46
we're actually doing

2580.42 --> 2585.16
like just comes walking in the in the

2582.46 --> 2588.76
workshop it's like like uh

2585.16 --> 2590.98
now don't don't attack the Dare

2588.76 --> 2594.5200000000004
something that came walking in just like

2590.98 --> 2596.56
Let It sniff around and

2594.52 --> 2598.18
the don't be aggressive it'll go away

2596.56 --> 2600.94
again

2598.18 --> 2603.5789999999997
right who knows it might

2600.94 --> 2604.66
become like domesticated and before you

2603.579 --> 2606.6400000000003
know it

2604.66 --> 2607.98
you got a reindeer working in the

2606.64 --> 2611.04
workshop

2607.98 --> 2611.04
you know

2628.42 --> 2635.14
the what what's my thoughts on the claim

2631.9 --> 2637.8
of 4.5 billion Earth

2635.14 --> 2637.7999999999997
what

2637.9 --> 2643.359
build

2639.579 --> 2646.42
billion Earth what years

2643.359 --> 2650.2599999999998
year old

2646.42 --> 2654.339
Earth using radiometric dating

2650.26 --> 2656.2000000000003
I think it's all mathematical garbage

2654.339 --> 2659.2
I mean what are they basing that on

2656.2 --> 2659.2
ridiculous

2659.38 --> 2663.94
that just

2661.96 --> 2667.0
using a

2663.94 --> 2669.4
A system that kind of sizes up like oh

2667.0 --> 2671.44
this is the changes on the short run and

2669.4 --> 2674.6800000000003
this is how we think

2671.44 --> 2676.2400000000002
it has worked up until the date so they

2674.68 --> 2678.64
basically gave you a readout of

2676.24 --> 2680.14
something that is kind of tangible and

2678.64 --> 2682.9
then

2680.14 --> 2685.42
they like speculate the rest of the

2682.9 --> 2687.579
graph right it's what they do with the

2685.42 --> 2689.619
supposed gas pressure gradient as well

2687.579 --> 2691.42
it's what they've done

2689.619 --> 2692.8
like there is a gas pressure gradient

2691.42 --> 2696.54
and then they just say look oh after

2692.8 --> 2696.54
that after that point it just gets

2696.64 --> 2703.48
it so they just take a real graph and

2699.88 --> 2705.819
then they just fantasize the rest of it

2703.48 --> 2708.4
that's what they've done

2705.819 --> 2710.8
with the age of the Earth and when they

2708.4 --> 2714.1800000000003
do carbon dating and radiometric dating

2710.8 --> 2714.1800000000003
they all do that

2715.72 --> 2721.18
they just

2717.94 --> 2723.7000000000003
get readouts and then they kind of put

2721.18 --> 2725.9199999999996
it on the graph and if there is no graph

2723.7 --> 2729.5989999999997
available then kind of it must kind of

2725.92 --> 2729.599
seem like it's cohesive

2730.24 --> 2733.319
that's how they work

2739.78 --> 2746.5600000000004
dating process degeneration of minerals

2743.079 --> 2749.38
there's no point zero

2746.56 --> 2751.619
that's that's hilarious so you can start

2749.38 --> 2751.619
water

2763.3 --> 2770.32
right

2764.72 --> 2770.3199999999997
[Music]

2778.54 --> 2782.7599999999998
the minerals do evaporate yeah

2782.859 --> 2786.7799999999997
minerals do all kinds of things

2791.92 --> 2796.98
[Music]

2793.48 --> 2796.98
minerals dissolve

2809.68 --> 2814.319
hmm

2810.94 --> 2814.319
ah Jeff gashead

2823.29 --> 2829.18
[Music]

2825.94 --> 2831.94
right so yeah Daniel Rebels every time

2829.18 --> 2835.359
when you hear those types of things

2831.94 --> 2836.7400000000002
that's Wizards bragging about

2835.359 --> 2840.819
their

2836.74 --> 2843.5989999999997
yeah about their balls and how much they

2840.819 --> 2847.18
dare to claim they know about it right

2843.599 --> 2849.099
it's wizard bragging oh we oh look we

2847.18 --> 2852.04
found this technology we know it's that

2849.099 --> 2853.54
old oh exactly like our model said oh

2852.04 --> 2855.64
really

2853.54 --> 2858.52
could it be that you just

2855.64 --> 2860.5589999999997
wizard tricked something

2858.52 --> 2864.099
and then like

2860.559 --> 2866.2000000000003
fidget like the added data onto the

2864.099 --> 2868.839
graph that you can't actually know and

2866.2 --> 2872.2599999999998
then oh it just magically happens to

2868.839 --> 2873.339
turn exactly into what your belief says

2872.26 --> 2875.26
oh

2873.339 --> 2878.92
okay

2875.26 --> 2881.44
all right heliocentric wizard you know

2878.92 --> 2883.3
everything even though that's not really

2881.44 --> 2884.44
possible like that

2883.3 --> 2886.3
right

2884.44 --> 2889.02
it's just

2886.3 --> 2889.02
human

2889.54 --> 2894.94
Bluff about oh we know everything we're

2892.72 --> 2896.6189999999997
the smartest because we have numbers for

2894.94 --> 2899.559
everything that's Way Beyond your reach

2896.619 --> 2901.839
we know everything that's billions and

2899.559 --> 2904.119
billions of miles away

2901.839 --> 2905.5589999999997
we can tell you the composition of the

2904.119 --> 2907.839
planet here and there even though

2905.559 --> 2910.48
nobody's ever been there physically

2907.839 --> 2913.48
and tell you exactly how old it is

2910.48 --> 2915.339
millions of years ago that's how old

2913.48 --> 2919.9
this is look

2915.339 --> 2922.18
we did this little gadget gadget thing

2919.9 --> 2923.319
it's all a bluff they don't actually

2922.18 --> 2927.3999999999996
know that

2923.319 --> 2929.98
they're just trying to calculate things

2927.4 --> 2933.9
and then make it fit their religious

2929.98 --> 2937.059
model which makes a lot of astronomical

2933.9 --> 2939.88
extremity claims it's like the oh we

2937.059 --> 2943.1800000000003
know it all model

2939.88 --> 2946.119
you don't know it all and it doesn't

2943.18 --> 2950.5789999999997
prove it it just makes all these claims

2946.119 --> 2950.579
about the extremities that it knows

2960.04 --> 2963.7599999999998
like the whole thing is basically a gas

2962.26 --> 2966.7000000000003
lighting

2963.76 --> 2969.28
religion about how we're smarter because

2966.7 --> 2973.0
we know so much

2969.28 --> 2974.6800000000003
so you gotta trust us even though they

2973.0 --> 2979.359
literally made up

2974.68 --> 2981.7
most of what they present as evidence

2979.359 --> 2983.2
for their superiority it's just made up

2981.7 --> 2985.72
[ __ ]

2983.2 --> 2988.5989999999997
and yeah it might be explicable through

2985.72 --> 2992.02
math it might fit some formula yeah it

2988.599 --> 2995.319
seems logical but seem

2992.02 --> 2997.96
s logical doesn't actually

2995.319 --> 3001.38
prove it though

2997.96 --> 3004.559
and complications of why

3001.38 --> 3008.1600000000003
things that seem logical aren't proof

3004.559 --> 3011.059
aren't exactly emphasized in the

3008.16 --> 3016.02
discipline of those that dabble into

3011.059 --> 3018.8
heliocentric religion Now isn't it huh

3016.02 --> 3018.8
ah

3038.94 --> 3043.28
an a level in geology oh really

3046.2 --> 3051.839
what kind of field work have you done

3048.319 --> 3055.579
logical conclusion

3051.839 --> 3055.5789999999997
Mr a level geology

3055.98 --> 3065.66
what what gave me a small summary

3061.38 --> 3069.119
of your giant in the field geology

3065.66 --> 3071.52
tests and accomplishments

3069.119 --> 3074.94
and if you're done

3071.52 --> 3078.18
or was it the geology kite that just

3074.94 --> 3081.68
kind of just look in this book

3078.18 --> 3081.68
it's in that sort of geology

3084.42 --> 3087.6800000000003
logical conclusion

3096.78 --> 3101.7000000000003
I do not know what it is

3099.9 --> 3103.859
I'm now

3101.7 --> 3109.02
that's not relevant that's a red herring

3103.859 --> 3112.7999999999997
I'm just asking you you claim to be

3109.02 --> 3115.619
prominent somehow with geology so I'm

3112.8 --> 3118.079
asking you okay

3115.619 --> 3121.44
so

3118.079 --> 3125.88
what have you done in the field

3121.44 --> 3130.14
how many of these conceptions have you

3125.88 --> 3134.1600000000003
physically tested to confirm it

3130.14 --> 3136.5
did you get actually empirical or did

3134.16 --> 3139.2599999999998
you stay purely with the theoretical

3136.5 --> 3141.3
speculation in the books logical

3139.26 --> 3143.94
conclusion that's my question it's a

3141.3 --> 3148.1400000000003
direct question

3143.94 --> 3151.88
appealing to my knowledge about words is

3148.14 --> 3151.8799999999997
not a proper answer to that question

3173.42 --> 3178.559
empirical regarding what you know what

3176.579 --> 3181.6800000000003
empiricism is

3178.559 --> 3184.76
it's when you actually do things in the

3181.68 --> 3184.7599999999998
physical real world

3184.859 --> 3191.7
yeah outside of theory conception books

3189.18 --> 3194.94
computer screens

3191.7 --> 3198.4199999999996
that's what I'm talking about

3194.94 --> 3201.42
and The prominent thing that was just

3198.42 --> 3203.4
a generalized approach an a level that

3201.42 --> 3206.099
sounds an a that sounds like in

3203.4 --> 3208.619
education language sounds like a good

3206.099 --> 3211.8
prominent thing I'm sorry

3208.619 --> 3213.96
I'm sorry if I got it slightly wrong the

3211.8 --> 3215.579
question still stands though yeah you

3213.96 --> 3218.54
said oh you're

3215.579 --> 3218.54
geology

3218.819 --> 3223.859
you pin some pride on yourself for that

3221.16 --> 3225.72
so I'm inquiring what's your field work

3223.859 --> 3228.359
what did you actually do in the physical

3225.72 --> 3231.0
world what did you actually test with

3228.359 --> 3233.7
the geology in the physical world with

3231.0 --> 3239.119
physical actions

3233.7 --> 3239.1189999999997
not pieces of paper computer screens

3247.68 --> 3252.1189999999997
right

3250.02 --> 3256.559
did you ever

3252.119 --> 3258.3
test anything about claims about geology

3256.559 --> 3261.96
like oh

3258.3 --> 3265.619
go into a very deep mind somewhere like

3261.96 --> 3267.96
really deep and then just test how

3265.619 --> 3270.42
the walls the material in the wall is

3267.96 --> 3271.7400000000002
different something like that yeah I

3270.42 --> 3273.9
barely know what I'm talking about

3271.74 --> 3277.2
really because I know how extensive

3273.9 --> 3279.48
geology is I just know there is a lot of

3277.2 --> 3282.66
field work

3279.48 --> 3284.78
it can and should be done to start

3282.66 --> 3287.7599999999998
really

3284.78 --> 3289.92
confirming more than just surface

3287.76 --> 3293.46
confirmation like oh oh yeah this is

3289.92 --> 3296.28
good enough but like really figuring out

3293.46 --> 3298.079
all these ideas and theories that go

3296.28 --> 3302.2400000000002
around in geology

3298.079 --> 3302.2400000000002
right that's a that's what I'm asking

3303.599 --> 3309.42
what did you do in the field concerning

3306.96 --> 3312.9
geology field work

3309.42 --> 3316.88
right the empirical part the actual

3312.9 --> 3316.88
testing of conceptions

3327.42 --> 3331.52
lost connection there oh great

3334.319 --> 3340.46
spend like over five minutes now trying

3337.02 --> 3340.46
to explain that so

3340.559 --> 3343.94
just scroll back

3344.16 --> 3347.16
listen

3360.26 --> 3367.0400000000004
a weak studying on an island in Scotland

3368.579 --> 3373.92
so you went to a special boy School you

3371.76 --> 3377.579
learned about geology

3373.92 --> 3379.319
I mean did they at least show you like a

3377.579 --> 3380.94
crystal or something

3379.319 --> 3382.859
anything

3380.94 --> 3387.0
real

3382.859 --> 3388.98
or was it just all theoretical

3387.0 --> 3391.619
that's the whole point like how can you

3388.98 --> 3395.48
call yourself a geologist if you only

3391.619 --> 3395.48
just looked in books

3396.059 --> 3398.78
it's ridiculous

3411.839 --> 3414.839
foreign

3421.2 --> 3426.96
I was really interested in geology in my

3423.9 --> 3429.42
life I actually went to like

3426.96 --> 3433.44
Minds

3429.42 --> 3435.92
to dig stuff out of the wall myself

3433.44 --> 3438.7200000000003
in like coal

3435.92 --> 3442.94
and chalk

3438.72 --> 3446.64
and I dug up fossils like even like

3442.94 --> 3449.96
crystals and stuff amazing I loved I

3446.64 --> 3449.96
loved the field part

3450.42 --> 3458.7200000000003
muscle Hunter I love that

3453.72 --> 3458.72
like it's so exciting to me to do that

3467.94 --> 3472.319
right and I was really interested like

3470.04 --> 3475.68
what is this

3472.319 --> 3477.96
how like looking just at the structure

3475.68 --> 3480.72
of of the rock or the Mind something

3477.96 --> 3483.54
that was scooped out it just reveals so

3480.72 --> 3487.4599999999996
much like how did it form like that

3483.54 --> 3487.46
like it would have been

3488.16 --> 3493.2
perhaps more liquid at some point and

3490.859 --> 3494.7799999999997
then it just starts to crystallize how

3493.2 --> 3498.66
does it crystallize the weight

3494.78 --> 3502.94
crystallizes naturally to me reveals

3498.66 --> 3502.94
like how like what happened

3505.5 --> 3510.72
and it just endlessly inspiring to me

3508.2 --> 3514.0789999999997
all that right

3510.72 --> 3517.319
but not just looking in my book geology

3514.079 --> 3518.88
oh look at the molten iron core it's so

3517.319 --> 3521.4
amazing

3518.88 --> 3524.04
look at how this is supposed to be

3521.4 --> 3525.9
working at the meteorology part right

3524.04 --> 3528.359
that part I did really like and it's

3525.9 --> 3530.2200000000003
like yeah you just look outside and try

3528.359 --> 3532.5
to compare the clouds and you learn a

3530.22 --> 3534.359
lot with meteorology which is adjacent

3532.5 --> 3537.059
with geology

3534.359 --> 3540.0589999999997
I did appreciate geology school it's

3537.059 --> 3541.799
just that the actual field work

3540.059 --> 3544.5
makes it real

3541.799 --> 3548.059
that's when in my opinion you can really

3544.5 --> 3548.059
start to call yourself a geologist

3548.28 --> 3555.8390000000004
or like an expert

3551.579 --> 3559.02
if it's just a bunch of books and

3555.839 --> 3561.48
I'm sorry it's nothing

3559.02 --> 3563.9
everybody gets to learn about that

3561.48 --> 3563.9
nonsense

3582.42 --> 3588.359
you have a qualification and you seem to

3584.7 --> 3592.2599999999998
think I'm being antagonistic no

3588.359 --> 3596.52
I just seemed like you were boasting a

3592.26 --> 3599.88
bit and I well basically try to help you

3596.52 --> 3602.24
get a little bit more down to earth pun

3599.88 --> 3602.2400000000002
intended

3603.599 --> 3606.2000000000003
so

3606.48 --> 3609.14
it's okay

3613.319 --> 3616.92
sorry if I rolled on a little long it's

3615.359 --> 3619.7
also because some other people in the

3616.92 --> 3619.7000000000003
chat are just

3620.52 --> 3626.54
ah

3623.359 --> 3626.54
derping out

3637.68 --> 3640.8799999999997
okay dude

3640.98 --> 3644.18
I'm sorry but

3645.54 --> 3650.22
I don't know if you're a troll or a

3648.059 --> 3653.5400000000004
little kid but you don't know how to

3650.22 --> 3653.54
properly communicate

3657.54 --> 3661.16
it's just nonsense

3663.359 --> 3669.119
I mean not forbidding you from

3666.96 --> 3671.04
tuning in

3669.119 --> 3673.319
you know but you're just blabbering

3671.04 --> 3676.2
nonsense it's it's not even really

3673.319 --> 3678.24
subject related

3676.2 --> 3680.3999999999996
I mean if you're gonna try to joke

3678.24 --> 3682.799
around then at least

3680.4 --> 3685.38
adapt the jokes to what's actually being

3682.799 --> 3689.839
talked about right

3685.38 --> 3689.839
you're just waffling about nonsense

3690.57 --> 3693.82
[Music]

3700.98 --> 3707.9
that's not an at-home just an insult

3704.94 --> 3707.9
uh

3714.299 --> 3719.22
no that isn't at home

3716.94 --> 3722.46
you dummy

3719.22 --> 3725.22
you don't seem to know too far what an

3722.46 --> 3728.42
ad hom is

3725.22 --> 3732.5989999999997
yeah an insult

3728.42 --> 3736.4
at the person it's deflecting

3732.599 --> 3738.839
the argumentation or the subject away

3736.4 --> 3742.2000000000003
from the debate

3738.839 --> 3744.42
subject at hand towards the person and

3742.2 --> 3748.0789999999997
aspects about them

3744.42 --> 3751.14
it is what at home is it's not just an

3748.079 --> 3755.2400000000002
insult that's the point

3751.14 --> 3755.24
at the man at home

3756.9 --> 3761.76
it wasn't an at-home we weren't having

3758.88 --> 3765.059
debate well I think Neil deGrasse Tyson

3761.76 --> 3768.119
lies feels differently about that I it

3765.059 --> 3771.1400000000003
seems like he kind of was engaging in a

3768.119 --> 3771.1400000000003
debate with you about something

3774.9 --> 3778.619
but even

3776.46 --> 3781.02
if that is not the case and you don't

3778.619 --> 3783.7200000000003
want to engage in a debate

3781.02 --> 3786.78
the analysis of an at-home in his

3783.72 --> 3789.24
example that he gave to you is correct

3786.78 --> 3791.8190000000004
to say no that's just an insult it's not

3789.24 --> 3792.8999999999996
an at-home it's just incorrect it is an

3791.819 --> 3796.2
at-home

3792.9 --> 3799.5
like even in common banter that's still

3796.2 --> 3802.799
an at-home it's just not the way that

3799.5 --> 3805.559
people really call it in general but

3802.799 --> 3807.48
technically it is an at-home so you're

3805.559 --> 3809.76
just incorrect

3807.48 --> 3812.119
that might be a little bit pedantic at

3809.76 --> 3812.119
this point

3823.38 --> 3827.52
hmm

3824.64 --> 3828.5989999999997
amazing geologists yeah sure seeking

3827.52 --> 3831.68
star water

3828.599 --> 3831.6800000000003
Sure Link it up

3834.42 --> 3840.92
Neil deGrasse Tyson

3836.819 --> 3840.92
is an ad helmet so yeah it is

3847.92 --> 3854.2400000000002
that's that's very observative observant

3850.74 --> 3854.24
of you Aries 106.

3854.4 --> 3857.61
[Music]

3860.3 --> 3863.559
[Music]

3873.19 --> 3876.289
[Music]

3877.2 --> 3884.7599999999998
he just no two for hello

3881.4 --> 3889.26
like are you on some drugs or something

3884.76 --> 3891.599
for my do you not no dude

3889.26 --> 3895.0200000000004
he was asking you

3891.599 --> 3898.7000000000003
is this an Anthem in his example was

3895.02 --> 3898.7
calling you a homo yeah

3899.52 --> 3905.299
that's a question he was asking is that

3902.579 --> 3905.299
an at-home

3906.18 --> 3913.02
you're the drug user here okay

3911.099 --> 3916.5
okay then

3913.02 --> 3919.2
well my drugs that I use

3916.5 --> 3921.66
don't degrade my faculties that I'm

3919.2 --> 3924.2
actually extremely Sharp

3921.66 --> 3924.2
yeah

3924.359 --> 3931.5589999999997
I asked about yours because you don't

3928.38 --> 3933.6600000000003
seem to be extremely Sharp

3931.559 --> 3936.42
I was wondering like hey are you like

3933.66 --> 3940.0389999999998
just on something that you're just not

3936.42 --> 3940.039
really paying attention too much

3943.819 --> 3952.2
yeah that's what I said you dimwit

3948.96 --> 3954.44
that's literally what I said it's a

3952.2 --> 3954.4399999999996
question

3958.98 --> 3963.78
like hello is English your first

3961.44 --> 3966.599
language are you Chinese or something

3963.78 --> 3969.3190000000004
like do you understand how language

3966.599 --> 3969.319
works

3969.96 --> 3976.2
what you're saying no he said this and

3973.68 --> 3979.52
that is that an at-home

3976.2 --> 3979.52
that's a question

3981.0 --> 3988.14
yeah is that an that's a question

3985.859 --> 3991.44
he might have not put a question mark in

3988.14 --> 3995.22
there or something that's just sloppy

3991.44 --> 4001.299
typing it's definitely a question

3995.22 --> 4001.299
what else is the point of saying that

4009.319 --> 4014.599
statement of oh oh okay so you are a

4012.859 --> 4016.96
home of that you're gay you're openly

4014.599 --> 4016.96
gay

4017.48 --> 4020.619
that's gross

4026.42 --> 4032.7200000000003
so yeah let's make it all about you now

4029.839 --> 4033.92
so it can move away from the fact that

4032.72 --> 4036.0789999999997
you don't know what the [ __ ] you're

4033.92 --> 4038.359
talking about

4036.079 --> 4041.299

4038.359 --> 4043.819
oh oh oh at home Mina okay learn how to

4041.299 --> 4045.74
use English okay well [ __ ] off then

4072.5 --> 4075.579
hey Godzilla

4081.92 --> 4087.339
using rage squirter ever

4084.5 --> 4087.339
uh

4089.9 --> 4094.3
I don't know if he even knew what he was

4092.0 --> 4096.259
doing here

4094.3 --> 4101.02
[Music]

4096.259 --> 4101.02
no you don't metal slugs cockatiel

4120.62 --> 4125.8589999999995
right anyway so I've got some orange

4123.14 --> 4125.859
juice here

4131.9 --> 4134.9
ah

4152.12 --> 4157.0599999999995
it's true for with no R is to do for it

4158.48 --> 4164.8589999999995
I don't know it didn't seem to me like

4161.299 --> 4164.859
the guy had any kind of point

4171.56 --> 4174.819
it's just whining

4177.38 --> 4182.4800000000005
constantly whining oh why did

4180.44 --> 4185.239
what do you think like he isn't even

4182.48 --> 4187.2789999999995
actually addressing anything he's just

4185.239 --> 4189.58
whining about what other people are

4187.279 --> 4192.4400000000005
saying and trying to

4189.58 --> 4196.159
gamma them into submission that they're

4192.44 --> 4196.159
wrong or something it's

4196.4 --> 4203.299999999999
surprised I didn't ban him earlier

4199.159 --> 4203.299999999999
must have been too occupied

4208.219 --> 4212.14
oh okay board is more

4224.659 --> 4228.639999999999
double Derby I get it now

4260.78 --> 4265.96
term used in the USA why though

4266.84 --> 4273.1
but sure

4268.64 --> 4273.1
I guess it's a USA thing to say

4275.36 --> 4280.759999999999
yes soccer counts I know

4278.54 --> 4283.159
somebody got stepped on their dick again

4280.76 --> 4286.54
but yeah that's why they

4283.159 --> 4286.54
come here I guess

4287.48 --> 4291.86
I mean they know what's gonna happen

4290.12 --> 4295.46
it's not like I've ever been

4291.86 --> 4297.92
inconsistent with how I deal with that

4295.46 --> 4300.1
sort of behavior

4297.92 --> 4300.1
foreign

4302.8 --> 4309.6990000000005
like at this the first few hundred shows

4306.92 --> 4309.6990000000005
you know

4310.159 --> 4314.199
but like at least like the last

4314.32 --> 4320.659
200 and more way more probably I've been

4318.26 --> 4322.6990000000005
like very consistent

4320.659 --> 4326.44
and how I deal with that so yeah you

4322.699 --> 4326.44
should know what to expect

4338.9 --> 4342.44
yeah he was definitely triggered he

4340.82 --> 4344.0
stole your picture name too Daniel

4342.44 --> 4346.659
Robles

4344.0 --> 4346.659
is

4347.49 --> 4355.8589999999995
[Music]

4366.679 --> 4369.46
what

4379.82 --> 4385.42
I don't get it

4381.56 --> 4385.42
talk about clutch

4386.84 --> 4390.400000000001
spelled what oh

4392.3 --> 4395.1990000000005
he sucks

4404.48 --> 4412.12
oh ah okay goody

4409.159 --> 4412.12
uh

4414.38 --> 4420.86
hilarious yeah no not really though it's

4417.739 --> 4424.419999999999
not really talk for this floor no that's

4420.86 --> 4424.42
muddy talk come on

4429.92 --> 4434.719
ah damage you're trying to hide your

4432.5 --> 4436.34
smutty talk now so that I don't pick up

4434.719 --> 4439.159
on it you can still do your secret

4436.34 --> 4442.159000000001
smarty talk aren't you guys

4439.159 --> 4444.3099999999995
a bunch of old Boomers

4442.159 --> 4453.599999999999
I met

4444.31 --> 4453.6
[Music]

4468.02 --> 4472.88
sockets

4469.45 --> 4472.88
[Music]

4478.699 --> 4484.239
yeah no I'm fine with it it's just that

4480.86 --> 4484.239
I find it very distracting

4484.52 --> 4487.06
uh

4487.4 --> 4492.62
if you want to sneak that in and hide it

4490.1 --> 4495.4400000000005
that's fine as long as you like don't do

4492.62 --> 4499.4
what like Terror 306 did like two days

4495.44 --> 4501.379999999999
ago and just like overtly gross right

4499.4 --> 4502.94
that's what I don't want to see in my

4501.38 --> 4505.159000000001
chat

4502.94 --> 4506.719
if you want to be a bit sneaky about it

4505.159 --> 4510.139999999999
sure fine

4506.719 --> 4512.659
I mean who might like I can't prevent

4510.14 --> 4514.6990000000005
that from happening really

4512.659 --> 4518.259999999999
as long as it's not just in everybody's

4514.699 --> 4518.259999999999
faces overtly

4518.9 --> 4521.5599999999995
ah

4531.5 --> 4538.82
right so yeah I still gotta show to keep

4534.739 --> 4541.9
going even without sock trolls

4538.82 --> 4541.9
to talk about

4542.48 --> 4546.799999999999
what are we talking about I had geology

4544.34 --> 4550.76
right

4546.8 --> 4554.02
field testing it all came up

4550.76 --> 4554.02
because of that question

4560.239 --> 4566.36
about the Earth being supposedly 4.5

4562.76 --> 4569.5
billion years old and radiometric dating

4566.36 --> 4569.5
that's why that started

4572.54 --> 4576.88
right

4574.699 --> 4576.879999999999
right

4578.6 --> 4584.7390000000005
how old is the earth and how would we be

4582.02 --> 4584.7390000000005
able to tell

4586.48 --> 4592.48
that's a very

4588.92 --> 4592.4800000000005
very tough question

4592.58 --> 4597.32
it really is tough

4594.92 --> 4600.4400000000005
I've thought about it many times

4597.32 --> 4603.799999999999
because even things like oh look how

4600.44 --> 4606.62
much it's weathered right the weather

4603.8 --> 4609.9800000000005
over time like

4606.62 --> 4612.199
sand blows past it it scratches stuff

4609.98 --> 4615.678999999999
off and then just like a rough

4612.199 --> 4620.48
estimation of how long it would take to

4615.679 --> 4624.14
scratch off this much of the design

4620.48 --> 4626.299999999999
but even that is still

4624.14 --> 4629.3
kind of wet finger work

4626.3 --> 4632.3
because does that account for old like

4629.3 --> 4635.42
the situation changes

4632.3 --> 4638.6
like the entire climate shifting which

4635.42 --> 4641.42
is natural not man-made just naturally

4638.6 --> 4643.6990000000005
happens just like oh oh now it's not

4641.42 --> 4645.92
that type of weather anymore

4643.699 --> 4650.199
now it's suddenly raining all the time

4645.92 --> 4650.1990000000005
or it's like constant winds

4650.719 --> 4655.719
right

4652.58 --> 4659.0
like entire regions the weather does

4655.719 --> 4660.62
potentially go through pretty dramatic

4659.0 --> 4662.96
changes

4660.62 --> 4665.78
in time spans that are not like

4662.96 --> 4668.179
thousands of years apart

4665.78 --> 4671.98
things change so how are you gonna size

4668.179 --> 4671.9800000000005
up the real weathering you see

4672.38 --> 4677.12
that's the like one of the first

4674.54 --> 4679.46
problems in just systematically thinking

4677.12 --> 4681.0199999999995
about and trying to size up age just

4679.46 --> 4683.42
from weathering is like there's already

4681.02 --> 4686.84
a problem right there

4683.42 --> 4689.96
that's almost insurmountable

4686.84 --> 4691.46
you can't really properly give a linear

4689.96 --> 4693.679
system

4691.46 --> 4695.2390000000005
because you don't know everything that's

4693.679 --> 4698.12
happened

4695.239 --> 4700.839999999999
that influences how much weathering

4698.12 --> 4700.84
there even is

4707.3 --> 4710.179
right

4708.44 --> 4711.98
and that's

4710.179 --> 4714.9800000000005
and that's just one way of trying to

4711.98 --> 4717.5
date things objects mostly in buildings

4714.98 --> 4720.259999999999
architecture

4717.5 --> 4723.58
but then all the other influences it's

4720.26 --> 4723.58
just like oh come on man

4725.9 --> 4729.139999999999
right yeah you have manuscripts of

4728.0 --> 4732.56
course

4729.14 --> 4735.14
there's text there's information

4732.56 --> 4739.42
super old or some of it

4735.14 --> 4739.42
but even there it's like

4741.739 --> 4748.759999999999
at some point you are going to settle

4745.46 --> 4752.36
for a coherent picture

4748.76 --> 4754.96
that you want like absolutely be able to

4752.36 --> 4754.96
confirm

4757.76 --> 4762.860000000001
now where are the like Mandela effects

4761.179 --> 4764.96
influences or when are they going to

4762.86 --> 4766.699
arrive within that when is it

4764.96 --> 4769.699
the weird stuff gonna happen because

4766.699 --> 4771.879999999999
weird stuff does happen when you start

4769.699 --> 4774.86
to believe in things that you can't

4771.88 --> 4777.9400000000005
fully confirm

4774.86 --> 4777.94
happens to you

4781.04 --> 4787.82
right but yeah there is still plenty of

4784.52 --> 4791.360000000001
records of things happening

4787.82 --> 4794.12
and with dates

4791.36 --> 4796.58
and you can at least cross-reference all

4794.12 --> 4799.58
of it you can basically put it all on a

4796.58 --> 4802.58
giant pile connect all the lines and

4799.58 --> 4807.1
then just say like yeah stuff happened

4802.58 --> 4807.1
for this long this cohesively

4807.26 --> 4813.4400000000005
with event descriptions weather

4809.96 --> 4817.04
descriptions all that right all added on

4813.44 --> 4819.259999999999
top of it hopefully to clarify even more

4817.04 --> 4821.96
right

4819.26 --> 4824.84
and that's it it's like when the his

4821.96 --> 4827.179
yeah historical Scripts

4824.84 --> 4829.46
findings run out

4827.179 --> 4831.56
after that point

4829.46 --> 4834.199
just nothing

4831.56 --> 4835.6990000000005
you can do

4834.199 --> 4839.719
nothing

4835.699 --> 4843.759999999999
nothing to be absolutely certain

4839.719 --> 4843.76
of an exact timeline

4845.48 --> 4851.199
oldest rocks are g- old what

4853.219 --> 4856.699
eternity is difficult depend but it is

4854.9 --> 4859.659
impossible but in the Physical Realm

4856.699 --> 4859.659
it's just like

4864.62 --> 4871.099999999999
it is virtually impossible

4868.58 --> 4873.46
to really know with absolute certainty

4871.1 --> 4873.46
but

4873.92 --> 4880.34
we can do a whole bunch of modeling

4877.159 --> 4882.799999999999
and there is more and more and more and

4880.34 --> 4887.0
more information to cross-reference with

4882.8 --> 4889.9400000000005
to refine that I've already engaged in

4887.0 --> 4892.639
thinking very widely about like what has

4889.94 --> 4894.678999999999
happened really and big things and just

4892.639 --> 4897.92
not being constrained by anything

4894.679 --> 4900.86
anybody else says about it right that's

4897.92 --> 4902.42
how I came to the the history of the

4900.86 --> 4904.94
world

4902.42 --> 4907.76
series

4904.94 --> 4909.739
and that's way back Flat Earth talks

4907.76 --> 4912.4400000000005
remember that

4909.739 --> 4915.86
history of the world in three parts

4912.44 --> 4918.08
or maybe four and I thought three

4915.86 --> 4921.86
where I start to describe like

4918.08 --> 4924.739
based on including the flood

4921.86 --> 4928.12
but other elements as well

4924.739 --> 4931.58
try to figure out like a

4928.12 --> 4934.58
consecutive order of how things happen

4931.58 --> 4936.38
without being super specific about how

4934.58 --> 4940.4
much time they take but just a

4936.38 --> 4940.400000000001
consecutive order of

4940.96 --> 4946.4
historical changes that would have

4943.76 --> 4948.8
applied to everything and there's still

4946.4 --> 4951.92
room for improvement even within what I

4948.8 --> 4954.92
put down there back then

4951.92 --> 4957.5
right but that's modeling it's a it's a

4954.92 --> 4962.06
model when I do that

4957.5 --> 4964.1
like I can't palpably prove things about

4962.06 --> 4966.02
that

4964.1 --> 4968.780000000001
right

4966.02 --> 4971.080000000001
like the problem is like even with the

4968.78 --> 4971.08
flood

4973.28 --> 4979.219
like

4974.739 --> 4981.678999999999
exactly what it was how it was

4979.219 --> 4984.34
there's descriptions right there's

4981.679 --> 4987.04
descriptions there is

4984.34 --> 4991.46
suspicions like even from within

4987.04 --> 4994.88
geological circles like how

4991.46 --> 4998.2390000000005
things have settled how fossils end up

4994.88 --> 5000.219
like trees petrified upside down in the

4998.239 --> 5003.759999999999
middle of the dirt

5000.219 --> 5006.639
those are signs like yeah

5003.76 --> 5009.179
it was probably in a torrent and then it

5006.639 --> 5009.179
settled

5009.34 --> 5014.56
or

5011.52 --> 5016.900000000001
liquefaction but yeah then how do the

5014.56 --> 5018.400000000001
trees end up upside down I mean that

5016.9 --> 5020.259999999999
must have been one hell of a

5018.4 --> 5022.0
liquefaction event

5020.26 --> 5023.62
and it doesn't really make sense with

5022.0 --> 5026.44
the the design of the rest of the

5023.62 --> 5028.48
landscape etc etc so some kind of a

5026.44 --> 5029.5599999999995
flood can widely be deduced to have

5028.48 --> 5032.739
happen

5029.56 --> 5034.360000000001
many different aspects separate

5032.739 --> 5038.0199999999995
of

5034.36 --> 5039.5199999999995
written record references

5038.02 --> 5043.120000000001
right

5039.52 --> 5046.659000000001
see how freaking difficult it is though

5043.12 --> 5049.38
to really get empirical

5046.659 --> 5049.379999999999
these things

5049.78 --> 5053.679
would actually figure out what really

5051.82 --> 5056.08
happened what's the remnant of that

5053.679 --> 5058.8
what's the what remains behind that

5056.08 --> 5058.8
proves that

5059.199 --> 5065.678999999999
right also yeah because there's been

5061.8 --> 5069.820000000001
organizations unfortunately going around

5065.679 --> 5073.2390000000005
with an objective to try and erase that

5069.82 --> 5074.44
Knowledge from us to keep us ignorant on

5073.239 --> 5076.419999999999
purpose

5074.44 --> 5078.4
to withhold

5076.42 --> 5081.04
the connections

5078.4 --> 5083.5599999999995
with our most ancient Roots even through

5081.04 --> 5085.84
this farad world so they erase things

5083.56 --> 5087.46
they destroy it they mutilate it they

5085.84 --> 5090.219
put a cover story they built something

5087.46 --> 5092.86
else on top of it

5090.219 --> 5098.38
they erase things

5092.86 --> 5100.839999999999
very tactically it is super painful

5098.38 --> 5103.06
if you really figure out like how

5100.84 --> 5105.58
effective they are in doing that and

5103.06 --> 5110.679
that we don't have a grip on that at all

5105.58 --> 5114.159
because they do and they pay a very very

5110.679 --> 5116.139
high spiritual price for that

5114.159 --> 5119.98
I mean I personally cannot imagine

5116.139 --> 5121.54
anything more satanic than destroying

5119.98 --> 5125.099999999999
knowledge itself

5121.54 --> 5125.1
on purpose tactically

5130.9 --> 5135.339999999999
Bible chronically is four thousand years

5133.36 --> 5138.239
right well that's

5135.34 --> 5138.2390000000005
reasonable

5139.0 --> 5143.86
right there's no conclusive evidence to

5141.4 --> 5146.699
me that the Earth is literally 4 000

5143.86 --> 5146.699
years old though

5146.8 --> 5152.7390000000005
because

5149.08 --> 5155.679
what if they just made that

5152.739 --> 5159.04
made it start there what why why would

5155.679 --> 5161.5
you say that it is the absolute start

5159.04 --> 5163.3
it's their empirical evidence for that 4

5161.5 --> 5165.699
000 years old other than the historical

5163.3 --> 5168.179
records

5165.699 --> 5168.178999999999
right

5168.58 --> 5171.9
that's the issue again

5174.159 --> 5180.4
right what if there was entire human

5177.34 --> 5181.900000000001
civilization or like proto-humans are

5180.4 --> 5184.719
different

5181.9 --> 5187.36
before that that we're just there having

5184.719 --> 5190.199
their own civilizations and things that

5187.36 --> 5190.199
preceded us

5191.08 --> 5194.8
that we just

5192.639 --> 5197.9800000000005
don't even realize it could have been

5194.8 --> 5201.1
there it's all just weathered away or

5197.98 --> 5204.099999999999
buried or recycled

5201.1 --> 5204.1
reused

5204.699 --> 5209.739
so there is no real trace of it might

5207.88 --> 5212.679
there might be weird things that we just

5209.739 --> 5215.199
see as myth that could at some point as

5212.679 --> 5219.52
freakish as they seem and it's as funny

5215.199 --> 5223.12
as they become have been absolutely real

5219.52 --> 5225.639
how do you know with certainty

5223.12 --> 5226.719
what you have to have a scientist tell

5225.639 --> 5228.219
you whether that would have been

5226.719 --> 5230.44
possible or not

5228.219 --> 5232.06
really how do you know that they would

5230.44 --> 5234.04
really know that

5232.06 --> 5236.88
based on the knowledge that they have

5234.04 --> 5236.88
available to them

5237.219 --> 5239.699
right

5240.159 --> 5244.179
so yeah

5242.08 --> 5245.92
four thousand eight thousand what is it

5244.179 --> 5248.28
again how many thousands four thousand

5245.92 --> 5248.28
years old

5249.04 --> 5254.8
seven thousand right well what if it's

5253.0 --> 5257.38
basically

5254.8 --> 5259.78
500 000 years old

5257.38 --> 5262.3
and everything before that

5259.78 --> 5265.179
was it seven thousand

5262.3 --> 5268.679
it's just lost it's like there's no way

5265.179 --> 5268.679
to attain any of that

5270.1 --> 5274.4800000000005
it's been recycled everything's just

5272.62 --> 5277.5
recycled

5274.48 --> 5277.5
there's nothing left

5277.84 --> 5282.96
right how do you know

5280.36 --> 5282.96
I know

5283.06 --> 5288.04
right so unless you can anchor some very

5285.219 --> 5290.56
specific oh Jesus

5288.04 --> 5293.219
freaking headache

5290.56 --> 5293.219
Pacific

5295.48 --> 5301.959999999999
empirical evidence that would prove 7000

5299.199 --> 5304.379999999999
years then how could you be absolutely

5301.96 --> 5304.38
certain

5313.96 --> 5319.7390000000005
hmm

5315.28 --> 5319.739
I'm gonna take a bit of a breather

5321.639 --> 5324.179
oh

5424.179 --> 5426.9
yes

5431.139 --> 5435.0
weird headache I'm nowhere

5437.92 --> 5441.36
might be from the Hunger

5444.159 --> 5449.44
I mean I I'm I'm being really focused

5446.56 --> 5451.4800000000005
now so it literally might be like sugar

5449.44 --> 5453.94
shortage or something

5451.48 --> 5455.919999999999
I think I'm gonna

5453.94 --> 5458.799999999999
some grapefruit juice maybe that'll help

5455.92 --> 5461.8
be right back

5458.8 --> 5461.8
foreign

5549.94 --> 5552.48
okay

5554.62 --> 5557.219
you

5561.04 --> 5563.58
foreign

5579.219 --> 5584.58
what did God do before creating his

5581.739 --> 5584.58
realm I don't know

5592.96 --> 5596.26
does he have any other Realms to take

5594.94 --> 5598.0599999999995
care of

5596.26 --> 5602.860000000001
I doubt it

5598.06 --> 5606.1
or maybe there are a separated segments

5602.86 --> 5608.799999999999
that were once one right so what is this

5606.1 --> 5610.719
realm the realm

5608.8 --> 5613.9800000000005
was it one

5610.719 --> 5613.9800000000005
was it split up

5615.34 --> 5621.28
but yeah the design

5618.58 --> 5624.159
if any other separated Realms is gonna

5621.28 --> 5626.92
be of the same signature so effectively

5624.159 --> 5628.48
the same designer

5626.92 --> 5631.06
but

5628.48 --> 5632.5
they will all have originated from the

5631.06 --> 5637.360000000001
same route

5632.5 --> 5640.0
same route design so as if one

5637.36 --> 5643.0199999999995
even if there are other Realms separated

5640.0 --> 5643.02
from us out there

5643.239 --> 5650.339999999999
or they would simply not be compatible

5645.88 --> 5650.34
and then not ever relevant to us

5673.56 --> 5676.7390000000005
[ __ ] hell

5691.84 --> 5698.32
what is that

5694.6 --> 5700.780000000001
am I okay yeah no

5698.32 --> 5704.34
getting these freaking headache bursts

5700.78 --> 5704.34
it's really annoying

5709.0 --> 5714.42
it might be like sinus infection related

5711.88 --> 5714.42
or something

5716.139 --> 5724.86
fully out of the woods just yet

5720.42 --> 5724.86
but it's mostly just a nuisance

5742.36 --> 5748.9
this certainly does help

5745.78 --> 5751.719
I love being able to completely displace

5748.9 --> 5755.199
tension like that if I'm I mean yeah my

5751.719 --> 5758.08
arm's gonna get very tense

5755.199 --> 5760.119
but like as long as I do that I

5758.08 --> 5762.159
literally will not have births of

5760.119 --> 5763.78
headache

5762.159 --> 5767.28
so

5763.78 --> 5767.28
maybe seems kind of weird

5771.82 --> 5777.4
I hope the juice helps

5774.28 --> 5780.0599999999995
yeah I'm gonna try that

5777.4 --> 5780.0599999999995
foreign

5783.78 --> 5788.46
ERS boy dude I'm still like

5790.239 --> 5794.759999999999
I mean I had a pretty bad infection

5795.1 --> 5798.780000000001
what is it now a month ago

5799.54 --> 5805.239
and like I also noticed that as that was

5803.26 --> 5806.56
going that it was kind of trying to

5805.239 --> 5809.259999999999
spread around

5806.56 --> 5810.639
so I already said I think it's now a

5809.26 --> 5814.0
week ago

5810.639 --> 5816.2390000000005
like I'm probably gonna get sick at some

5814.0 --> 5816.239
point

5817.9 --> 5821.739
like maybe get a sinus infection or

5820.0 --> 5823.36
something right and that hasn't really

5821.739 --> 5825.459999999999
happened like I've been expecting like

5823.36 --> 5828.159
when am I gonna get like

5825.46 --> 5829.78
sort of a flu

5828.159 --> 5832.78
but

5829.78 --> 5835.0
it seems like there is sort of that

5832.78 --> 5838.42
impulse but I'm not really getting sick

5835.0 --> 5841.3
so I'm I'm still really healthy

5838.42 --> 5843.88
but there is side effects

5841.3 --> 5847.56
it's just aftermath

5843.88 --> 5847.56
chemical juice yuck

5855.32 --> 5858.389999999999
[Music]

5865.84 --> 5868.5
wow

5879.0 --> 5883.179
might be

5880.9 --> 5886.0199999999995
look guys it's

5883.179 --> 5886.02
letting go

5887.02 --> 5890.52
I'm trying to let it go

5891.46 --> 5896.1
right I don't have like a toothache or

5893.98 --> 5896.099999999999
anything

5900.82 --> 5905.0199999999995
exposed nerve yeah well that's just

5902.92 --> 5908.139
gonna [ __ ] you that's yeah no [ __ ]

5905.02 --> 5911.56
you're gonna get a headache then duh

5908.139 --> 5915.96
that's not what this is no I I'm I can't

5911.56 --> 5915.96
eat I can chew fully no problem

5925.92 --> 5932.76
Tooth Fairy what

5928.48 --> 5932.759999999999
two for eight oh that's funny Wrath

5943.3 --> 5948.4800000000005
it might be because I just didn't have

5945.52 --> 5948.4800000000005
like any breakfast

5962.02 --> 5964.92
foreign

5992.08 --> 5996.48
hmm it might actually be helping

6039.5 --> 6044.48
what wrath excuse me

6047.28 --> 6050.46
[Music]

6050.54 --> 6055.28
that may be a little bit of a stretch

6053.04 --> 6055.28
there

6120.6 --> 6123.26
right

6159.06 --> 6162.9800000000005
yes clutch I've heard that too

6163.32 --> 6166.219
indeed

6168.36 --> 6173.699
and I have a suspicion that Jesus also

6171.3 --> 6176.2390000000005
met up with other ascended masters when

6173.699 --> 6176.239
he did that

6181.32 --> 6184.34
in India

6223.199 --> 6225.799999999999
foreign

6260.219 --> 6263.219
Traveler

6282.36 --> 6285.139
hmm

6302.46 --> 6305.84
okay interesting

6327.0 --> 6329.659
hmm

6333.239 --> 6337.86
okay that's a very interesting link

6335.34 --> 6340.04
there Stephen Travelers thank you for

6337.86 --> 6340.04
that

6350.159 --> 6353.119
hmm

6371.58 --> 6375.679
but yeah that's a funny idea

6376.02 --> 6382.320000000001
I mean could probably be done in general

6380.58 --> 6384.9
now that I'm thinking but I might have

6382.32 --> 6386.639
like I've already I read it as a bit an

6384.9 --> 6388.799999999999
idea that isn't actually in there

6386.639 --> 6390.96
happens all the time it just think like

6388.8 --> 6393.42
oh yeah of course it's that no wait it

6390.96 --> 6394.7390000000005
isn't that I made that up it's a really

6393.42 --> 6397.08
good idea

6394.739 --> 6400.159
or maybe or maybe not

6397.08 --> 6400.159
just saying that

6400.32 --> 6405.119
personal memory yeah

6402.6 --> 6407.1
well that that's a thing

6405.119 --> 6411.179
I'm also thinking that yeah you could

6407.1 --> 6412.860000000001
probably like even cast clay or Rock

6411.179 --> 6417.08
or stone

6412.86 --> 6417.08
and then potentially insert

6417.239 --> 6420.659
natural

6418.8 --> 6423.900000000001
perfume in it

6420.659 --> 6426.119
like in the Stone

6423.9 --> 6428.58
and then do it in a certain way that it

6426.119 --> 6431.839999999999
like you can't wash it out like it's

6428.58 --> 6431.84
gonna always smell of it

6432.179 --> 6438.619
I'm just thinking about that like that

6434.58 --> 6438.619
that should be technically possible

6441.0 --> 6446.639
I don't know why I came up with that but

6443.34 --> 6448.88
that's what I came up with is as I read

6446.639 --> 6448.88
that

6449.82 --> 6453.84
I mean that would be pretty interesting

6451.92 --> 6456.08
if you could make like a statue or

6453.84 --> 6456.08
something

6456.119 --> 6461.04
and it would always smell in a certain

6458.4 --> 6463.619
way it would like always forever as long

6461.04 --> 6464.94
as they're like even if like a part of

6463.619 --> 6468.5
it broke off

6464.94 --> 6468.5
then you'd smell it even more

6468.78 --> 6474.0599999999995
because yeah some of it is freshly

6471.78 --> 6476.159
exposed it would be all throughout the

6474.06 --> 6479.219
entire grain of the Stone

6476.159 --> 6481.879999999999
the cast stone right

6479.219 --> 6481.88
hmm

6551.76 --> 6554.360000000001
hmm

6563.46 --> 6567.84
okay I'm just letting you guys talk now

6565.98 --> 6570.839999999999
it's just

6567.84 --> 6574.6990000000005
so very interesting I don't feel like I

6570.84 --> 6574.6990000000005
really have anything specific to add

6583.0 --> 6586.619
[Music]

6589.139 --> 6596.84
but yeah there's many parallel Jesus

6593.159 --> 6596.839999999999
stories in other religions too

6597.06 --> 6599.96
absolutely

6619.92 --> 6626.0
is update onto the yes yeah the Link's

6623.52 --> 6626.0
already out

6626.159 --> 6630.138999999999
I think I'm going to round out the show

6630.3 --> 6633.679
it's been interesting

6635.4 --> 6640.44
but yeah the the that headache thing did

6638.52 --> 6642.96
kind of disrupt the last part of my show

6640.44 --> 6645.44
now I just

6642.96 --> 6645.44
no

I think it is gone though but that

6648.659 --> 6653.48

6651.06 --> 6653.4800000000005
focus

6653.57 --> 6656.759999999999

right but I'm rounding out the show guys

6701.4 --> 6707.54
it's a bit early but

6705.06 --> 6707.54
yes

6710.34 --> 6715.4400000000005
it's a pretty good show but I don't

6711.9 --> 6718.44
really remember like the headache really

6715.44 --> 6718.44
disrupted

6718.679 --> 6726.3
I have to watch it back

6721.619 --> 6727.92
a lot of like archeology talk and and

6726.3 --> 6729.719
was it again

6727.92 --> 6733.1990000000005
geology

6729.719 --> 6735.36
about the field work versus Theory which

6733.199 --> 6736.379999999999
is a good thing to think about to ponder

6735.36 --> 6738.239
upon

6736.38 --> 6741.0
and there's a lot of people that learn

6738.239 --> 6743.339999999999
about geology how many of them actually

6741.0 --> 6747.739
do field work

6743.34 --> 6747.7390000000005
very few I can tell you that

6747.86 --> 6752.759999999999
Mouse is just like oh this is what the

6750.239 --> 6754.619
book says yeah that's your geology learn

6752.76 --> 6757.56
what the book says

6754.619 --> 6761.699
not actually doing field work or

6757.56 --> 6764.34
empiricism testing what the book says

6761.699 --> 6766.98
right and that's a problem it's a

6764.34 --> 6768.84
