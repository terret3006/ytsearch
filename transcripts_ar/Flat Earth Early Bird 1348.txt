120.56 --> 126.799
clear blue sky part just yet it's been

123.2 --> 129.2
very cloudy and even some bigger clouds

126.799 --> 132.239
i haven't felt any rain so far but that

129.2 --> 132.23899999999998
could still change

133.12 --> 138.239
also a lot less wind

136.239 --> 141.239
so it's yeah a very different day from

138.239 --> 141.239
yesterday

142.8 --> 145.84
it's kind of chilly

146.08 --> 152.12
not really that bad i think

148.4 --> 152.12
let me check the temperature

157.12 --> 163.20000000000002
hello psych bear first in chat

160.16 --> 163.2
we're very quick there

167.12 --> 173.87900000000002
it is

168.64 --> 173.879
monday the 29th of august 2022

182.959 --> 187.12
it's still 21 degrees apparently

192.959 --> 199.12
it doesn't really feel like that but

196.64 --> 202.79999999999998
oh well

199.12 --> 202.8
i'm still here in my shirt so

207.44 --> 211.2
how was my weekend

210.08 --> 213.84
yeah

211.2 --> 213.83999999999997
uh

216.64 --> 220.879
the shows were extremely intense

221.12 --> 226.0
in a good way

223.28 --> 228.239
i mean i watched both shows back from

226.0 --> 230.48
this weekend and they were

228.239 --> 232.799
good

230.48 --> 235.439
and have been good for a while

232.799 --> 238.239
but yeah other than that wasn't all that

235.439 --> 241.28
much out there

238.239 --> 245.92000000000002
stream wise

241.28 --> 245.92
like even nathan streams just like

248.319 --> 254.67999999999998
very few

250.959 --> 254.68
keep missing him

256.799 --> 260.88
all right because every time i ended my

258.479 --> 262.479
show like that the premiere that nathan

260.88 --> 265.12
would do typically in that time slot

262.479 --> 268.12
would already be over so

265.12 --> 268.12
uh

281.6 --> 286.40000000000003
i uh watching a snippet

284.479 --> 289.52
roman stream own benjamin apparently

286.4 --> 289.52
still did yesterday

292.56 --> 299.04
i watched just a bit of that

297.04 --> 300.72
so he seems like he's like

299.04 --> 302.639
it's funny because i talk about

300.72 --> 304.72
dreamwalking and all that

302.639 --> 306.32
but guess what he's talking about it

304.72 --> 308.0
sorta too now

306.32 --> 310.479
he's even trying to lay down the

308.0 --> 312.24
esoteric method of

310.479 --> 314.639
what i've been doing and that is just to

312.24 --> 316.639
have everything be spontaneous and to

314.639 --> 318.96000000000004
basically let your powers arrive from

316.639 --> 320.88
god spontaneously and he you literally

318.96 --> 322.96
had a whole segment just laying that out

320.88 --> 326.88
and it's just like yeah yeah you get it

322.96 --> 330.08
that that's that's how that works

326.88 --> 330.08
it's pretty amazing

330.16 --> 332.88000000000005
so yeah

333.6 --> 337.6
i'm kind of looking forward to owen

335.44 --> 340.08
benjamin like this week

337.6 --> 344.88
because it seems like he's like

340.08 --> 344.88
really charged and compacted the battery

344.96 --> 350.0
and he's expanding on the whole trump

347.28 --> 352.71999999999997
911 thing

350.0 --> 354.16
and it's it's kind of scary in a way for

352.72 --> 355.6
me it's

354.16 --> 357.68
maybe it's because i just don't want to

355.6 --> 360.47900000000004
see it

357.68 --> 363.52
but he's showing it anyway

360.479 --> 366.68
anyway hello elise g good to see you pj

363.52 --> 366.68
c net

378.0 --> 387.6
what are you talking about pj cena

382.08 --> 387.59999999999997
4.1 billion firework show what the hell

388.479 --> 390.8
where

391.84 --> 394.4
that's

392.84 --> 396.08
insane

394.4 --> 399.039
like what are they gonna do like send an

396.08 --> 399.75899999999996
entire ufo of fireworks just in the sky

399.039 --> 402.639
and

399.759 --> 402.639
like what

405.12 --> 410.08
oh

406.16 --> 410.08000000000004
a rocket [ __ ] oh okay

410.8 --> 413.599
hello rick back

414.16 --> 417.36

415.36 --> 419.36
not even thinking that oh yeah of course

417.36 --> 421.28000000000003
that's that's gonna be some speech

419.36 --> 423.599

421.28 --> 425.75899999999996
fireworks i'm not like holy [ __ ] that's

423.599 --> 427.44
gonna be one hell of a firework show

425.759 --> 429.36
then

427.44 --> 430.96
but yeah if it's just some stupid rocket

429.36 --> 432.56
launch it's always gonna be extremely

430.96 --> 436.039
overpriced

432.56 --> 436.039
that makes sense

454.88 --> 458.56
oh god

456.639 --> 463.0
a little frustrated today

458.56 --> 463.0
bumping into some annoying news

464.0 --> 471.199
there's like a new great reset action

468.4 --> 473.84
we're literally in the netherlands

471.199 --> 475.84000000000003
according to this number 100

473.84 --> 477.35999999999996
in 18

475.84 --> 479.52
counties here

477.36 --> 480.879
cities

479.52 --> 483.84
are like

480.879 --> 485.59900000000005
going to erect a special great reset

483.84 --> 486.96
flag and i'm like

485.599 --> 488.71999999999997
[ __ ]

486.96 --> 490.63899999999995
you

488.72 --> 495.44000000000005
and it's a freaking ugly thing it's like

490.639 --> 495.44
a corporation flag it's so disgusting

495.599 --> 500.08
i can't believe that this is happening

502.56 --> 509.199
i mean look at that thing jesus

506.16 --> 512.5600000000001
i'm gonna present it just

509.199 --> 512.5600000000001
so disgusting

516.719 --> 520.5600000000001
i mean

517.76 --> 523.12
like that thing is so freaking ugly like

520.56 --> 524.8
even the german stasi government

523.12 --> 528.16
wouldn't approve something that [ __ ]

524.8 --> 528.16
ugly it's monstrous

529.76 --> 532.0
just

532.399 --> 535.839
just look at that

536.24 --> 538.88
jesus

541.279 --> 546.959
i mean it's it's one hell of an

544.399 --> 551.72
accomplishment to have your flag be even

546.959 --> 551.7199999999999
uglier than the lgbt flag

562.16 --> 565.279
so anyway

571.04 --> 576.519
hey slow mo moon buggy

573.12 --> 576.519
good to see you

600.959 --> 606.0
looks like a monopoly boy right i know

603.6 --> 609.0
right gadget inspector totally

606.0 --> 609.0
ridiculous

634.64 --> 636.959
hmm

638.56 --> 644.0
right so yeah i feel something coming

641.839 --> 646.72
it's the end of summer

644.0 --> 649.2
we've already heard like rumors way

646.72 --> 651.36
ahead of time that they want to lock

649.2 --> 654.32
down for some stupid new disease or

651.36 --> 654.32
whatever again

654.56 --> 660.4799999999999
probably in september and now this it

657.68 --> 662.4799999999999
just feels like we're gonna get like a

660.48 --> 664.64
double whammy

662.48 --> 668.0
of disgusting

664.64 --> 670.3199999999999
satanic world economic forum propaganda

668.0 --> 673.12
this coming period we're gonna see like

670.32 --> 675.2
another level like we didn't even wanna

673.12 --> 677.04
know it could get worse well guess what

675.2 --> 679.36
you're gonna know anyway

677.04 --> 682.16
here it comes it's gonna be so [ __ ]

679.36 --> 685.36
shitty you're literally

682.16 --> 686.64
like gonna have like very serious issues

685.36 --> 689.519
just not

686.64 --> 693.04
piling on these scumbags and just

689.519 --> 696.16
scratching their [ __ ] faces off

693.04 --> 698.64
because it's gonna be so unbelievably

696.16 --> 702.36
[ __ ] up and ugly

698.64 --> 702.36
what they're gonna do

704.56 --> 710.959
so yeah maybe the great clawing will

707.36 --> 714.0
also commence i highly doubt it though

710.959 --> 714.8389999999999
i mean humanity has not seen nearly

714.0 --> 718.959
enough

714.839 --> 718.9590000000001
suffering to let that happen

725.839 --> 728.72
hey susie s

727.279 --> 732.079
boynich

728.72 --> 734.0
the dutch will rise i hope so i hope so

732.079 --> 738.6389999999999
voynich

734.0 --> 738.639
i mean i am like in a mood now where

741.2 --> 744.5600000000001
dude

742.399 --> 746.56
it's

744.56 --> 750.6389999999999
if i would have been like 20 years

746.56 --> 753.1199999999999
younger i would be like so

750.639 --> 755.12
bad out there

753.12 --> 756.48
i would probably do a whole bunch of

755.12 --> 759.2
[ __ ]

756.48 --> 761.519
like

759.2 --> 765.6800000000001
against this sort of thing like i'm not

761.519 --> 765.68
doing that now it's just like now

766.32 --> 771.839
but i would be like okay let's just

769.68 --> 773.92
go around on like my scooter or

771.839 --> 774.8000000000001
something and

773.92 --> 777.04
and

774.8 --> 779.3599999999999
like see where we can find those flags

777.04 --> 781.5999999999999
and then light them on fire and just

779.36 --> 784.0
like burn all those flags

781.6 --> 788.0790000000001
and who knows maybe i i would have been

784.0 --> 790.079
doing that with the lgbt flags too

788.079 --> 791.519
just go around and just like oh there we

790.079 --> 792.6389999999999
got one

791.519 --> 796.9590000000001
bye

792.639 --> 797.839
just [ __ ] you burn it go away

796.959 --> 799.68
and

797.839 --> 802.0790000000001
run off

799.68 --> 802.079
next

805.839 --> 810.399
so a little left to lose now yeah right

807.839 --> 811.44
well i am kind of waiting to the moment

810.399 --> 813.68
where

811.44 --> 816.0790000000001
we can just basically all of us all the

813.68 --> 817.92
dutch people can just really look at one

816.079 --> 819.68
another and like

817.92 --> 822.7199999999999
i'm going to do something now that's

819.68 --> 826.3199999999999
really illegal and like probably

822.72 --> 828.72
assault maybe even sort of murder

826.32 --> 832.0790000000001
potentially could come out of it

828.72 --> 834.8000000000001
are you guys okay with that now or am i

832.079 --> 838.4799999999999
gonna get it afterward

834.8 --> 841.12
because i'm not gonna like yeah attack

838.48 --> 844.399
this thing

841.12 --> 847.12
if nobody's gonna thank me for it

844.399 --> 850.0
right so i'm kind of like looking like

847.12 --> 851.36
okay okay there's a lot of a lot of

850.0 --> 853.44
anger

851.36 --> 855.839
online and all that

853.44 --> 858.24
but i'm not seeing it yet in the in the

855.839 --> 860.24
physical world

858.24 --> 862.72
that you're still most of the time just

860.24 --> 866.48
having their mask

862.72 --> 866.48
they can still safely uphold it

867.92 --> 873.4399999999999
right and you know when the time is

870.72 --> 875.44
there when the dutch will not be able to

873.44 --> 877.839
uphold that mask anymore and they will

875.44 --> 879.2790000000001
be just like this must end now this must

877.839 --> 880.639
end now

879.279 --> 882.48
so

880.639 --> 885.6
upside down flags

882.48 --> 888.32
yeah okay sure

885.6 --> 888.32
if you got one

888.639 --> 891.839
but

889.44 --> 894.0790000000001
is that really accomplishing anything

891.839 --> 894.0790000000001
though

895.44 --> 900.0400000000001
i'm not sure anymore maybe this is just

897.839 --> 903.6
like a

900.04 --> 905.519
tic-tac-toe game or something

903.6 --> 907.839
that just has to be

905.519 --> 911.12
kept i

907.839 --> 914.0790000000001
i like the dutch situation just puzzles

911.12 --> 915.68
me really badly it it feels so

914.079 --> 917.92
counterintuitive

915.68 --> 922.56
to me everything about it

917.92 --> 922.56
just it seems like it's endless nene

923.04 --> 927.3199999999999
and i'm not good at that at all

929.68 --> 933.8389999999999
it's just a sign better sign than others

931.92 --> 936.16
yeah i agree

933.839 --> 939.48
dutch aren't heroes

936.16 --> 939.48
no weird

941.04 --> 944.88
i

942.639 --> 948.5600000000001
i guess that if you gotta really pin it

944.88 --> 951.68
down it's it's tradesmen

948.56 --> 954.8
so we adapt we adapt to like whatever

951.68 --> 955.92
situation no matter how hectic

954.8 --> 958.88
to then

955.92 --> 961.92
master it and then thrive out of it

958.88 --> 963.92
right that's what is so typically dutch

961.92 --> 965.36
only now it's

963.92 --> 967.759
like these

965.36 --> 969.839
skills we've built

967.759 --> 972.0790000000001
over the generations and through our

969.839 --> 974.32
national identity

972.079 --> 976.079
have been identified by the opponent and

974.32 --> 978.0790000000001
where it just feels like we're

976.079 --> 983.0
constantly being played like we're

978.079 --> 983.0
almost being juggled by our impulses

983.68 --> 989.8389999999999
and that's why i'm basically doing

986.56 --> 991.92
something impulsively that is extremely

989.839 --> 995.839
the opposite of typically dutch and just

991.92 --> 998.079
saying like no go at them right

995.839 --> 1000.639
like brutalize it

998.079 --> 1002.4799999999999
because that is very not dutch

1000.639 --> 1005.12
to do that

1002.48 --> 1010.12
but it or at least that's what it's

1005.12 --> 1010.12
become it's become not dutch

1012.0 --> 1018.399
but i know for a fact that deep inside

1015.36 --> 1020.8000000000001
at the roots of it all it is there it is

1018.399 --> 1023.04
very dutch to just like

1020.8 --> 1025.52
as a as like a spiritual collective like

1023.04 --> 1027.199
realize this is [ __ ] we got to take

1025.52 --> 1028.959
care of this right now and then

1027.199 --> 1030.319
everybody does it

1028.959 --> 1032.64
immediately

1030.319 --> 1035.9189999999999
even if before it all seemed like it was

1032.64 --> 1035.919
going to go great and all that

1036.0 --> 1041.28
there is that potential only how do you

1038.559 --> 1042.959
reach that switch moment how the hell

1041.28 --> 1046.3999999999999
are we going to reach it when we've been

1042.959 --> 1049.799
like conditioned not the trigger

1046.4 --> 1049.799
for decades

1052.08 --> 1057.84
right only trigger on the stupid sjw

1056.0 --> 1060.559
communist

1057.84 --> 1063.12
gravel media agenda that's what they've

1060.559 --> 1064.08
tried to condition us on hasn't really

1063.12 --> 1066.7199999999998
worked

1064.08 --> 1068.559
but we've been de-conditioned to have

1066.72 --> 1071.3600000000001
visceral responses

1068.559 --> 1075.72
in general because of social media

1071.36 --> 1075.7199999999998
persecution and other stuff

1080.88 --> 1086.24
i'm obviously a freemason oh cool

1083.12 --> 1088.2399999999998
stephanie graffiti cool uh could you

1086.24 --> 1089.679
tell me which lodge

1088.24 --> 1091.76
i'm a part of

1089.679 --> 1095.2
where i'm registered

1091.76 --> 1097.84
as a freemason that would be great

1095.2 --> 1097.8400000000001
stephanie

1100.48 --> 1106.08
i have no memory of ever having built a

1103.039 --> 1106.08
wall for free

1106.48 --> 1111.919
although i would probably do it

1109.44 --> 1113.6000000000001
but hey yeah you could call me that as

1111.919 --> 1116.5590000000002
much as you like

1113.6 --> 1116.559
what's your evidence

1120.0 --> 1126.52
you know what a freemason is stephanie

1122.24 --> 1126.52
graffiti do you know

1139.12 --> 1143.28
or are you just a suck

1147.28 --> 1151.76
or didn't you

1149.12 --> 1153.76
didn't you expect that the guy actually

1151.76 --> 1156.16
having a live show in which you are in

1153.76 --> 1158.799
the chat would read what you say and

1156.16 --> 1161.1200000000001
then immediately respond to it and

1158.799 --> 1162.96
inquire did you not expect that

1161.12 --> 1165.28
you think this is just

1162.96 --> 1166.96
some random guy

1165.28 --> 1169.44
online

1166.96 --> 1172.72
that just lets people blabber

1169.44 --> 1174.72
incessantly in my chat and without even

1172.72 --> 1175.76
giving it a glimpse you think i'm that

1174.72 --> 1179.32
guy

1175.76 --> 1179.32
no no i'm not

1182.08 --> 1186.8799999999999
a mason chiseled her jawline

1185.039 --> 1189.8799999999999
i don't know i don't know if that's even

1186.88 --> 1189.88
her

1196.32 --> 1202.24
this

1198.4 --> 1202.24
okay singed man that's hilarious

1202.64 --> 1207.76
you get a wrench by the way

1205.679 --> 1211.52
i know you are

1207.76 --> 1214.32
but uh yeah you don't actually get stuff

1211.52 --> 1216.32
just for free because you're a freemason

1214.32 --> 1221.84
it's not like

1216.32 --> 1221.84
a socialism guild as far as i know

1224.96 --> 1229.1200000000001
i mean the special handshake and [ __ ] i

1227.039 --> 1230.799
mean that might be kind of useful i

1229.12 --> 1232.3999999999999
guess

1230.799 --> 1234.6399999999999
if you're like

1232.4 --> 1235.44
in a foreign country and you've been

1234.64 --> 1237.679
like

1235.44 --> 1239.8400000000001
accused of a crime because you've right

1237.679 --> 1243.3600000000001
now been caught in an accident and you

1239.84 --> 1245.6789999999999
might have to show up in court and then

1243.36 --> 1245.6789999999999
then

1246.24 --> 1249.679
you know like having the handshake it

1248.559 --> 1250.8799999999999
might

1249.679 --> 1252.799
be useful

1250.88 --> 1255.0390000000002
they probably already know though

1252.799 --> 1256.96
because you see the handshake and all

1255.039 --> 1258.799
that special i don't even know how it

1256.96 --> 1260.4
works really

1258.799 --> 1261.6
i don't know exactly about the

1260.4 --> 1264.0
handshakes

1261.6 --> 1266.32
don't care never need to use because

1264.0 --> 1270.4
this is the internet age

1266.32 --> 1272.8799999999999
people like judges now just look you up

1270.4 --> 1274.96
you don't need to communicate anymore

1272.88 --> 1276.72
that oh i'm a free person because i do

1274.96 --> 1280.0
the special handshake because you're

1276.72 --> 1282.799
just registered at a lodge so they just

1280.0 --> 1283.679
google your name and then oh oh yeah oh

1282.799 --> 1285.679
hey

1283.679 --> 1287.44
he's in there

1285.679 --> 1291.8400000000001
right it's not

1287.44 --> 1291.8400000000001
it's not like 300 years ago anymore

1294.4 --> 1300.0800000000002
so yeah singed man

1297.039 --> 1300.08
hilarious but

1300.4 --> 1306.72
unfortunately special handshakes don't

1302.88 --> 1306.72
get you a free meal and [ __ ]

1307.679 --> 1313.44
although maybe there are like club

1311.2 --> 1315.44
freemason meetings

1313.44 --> 1317.3600000000001
where you do like get a free lunch or

1315.44 --> 1319.6000000000001
something

1317.36 --> 1322.8799999999999
but i mean that's gonna come out of your

1319.6 --> 1322.8799999999999
membership fee then

1324.96 --> 1330.159
i think there is like a membership fee

1327.919 --> 1333.44
like i don't think they even let you in

1330.159 --> 1336.96
unless you have like a a career

1333.44 --> 1336.96
with a stable paid job

1338.159 --> 1341.0390000000002
i'm not sure though i've never even

1339.84 --> 1344.0
tried

1341.039 --> 1345.44
i'm just not interested

1344.0 --> 1348.08
i think

1345.44 --> 1350.0800000000002
they're kind of archaic and i feel like

1348.08 --> 1352.48
i've already assimilated most knowledge

1350.08 --> 1354.32
that i even tried to keep a secret

1352.48 --> 1356.32
anyway

1354.32 --> 1359.4399999999998
right and that's why i kind of like oh

1356.32 --> 1362.6399999999999
yeah yeah no i know i clean the 33 it's

1359.44 --> 1364.64
mine 33 is mine

1362.64 --> 1365.76
i claim it

1364.64 --> 1367.76
yeah

1365.76 --> 1368.559
i'm not gonna have

1367.76 --> 1370.4
them

1368.559 --> 1371.76
claim that

1370.4 --> 1373.679
and then it's theirs and then

1371.76 --> 1375.52
everybody's afraid of it

1373.679 --> 1377.2800000000002
no no i'm literally

1375.52 --> 1378.24
going to just like

1377.28 --> 1381.12
nope

1378.24 --> 1385.0
i see what that is

1381.12 --> 1385.0
and i'm taking it

1385.98 --> 1390.799
[Music]

1388.24 --> 1394.6
definitely have to pay dues as a mason

1390.799 --> 1394.6
right i thought so

1404.88 --> 1410.2
masons hate you

1406.72 --> 1410.2
how do you know

1429.679 --> 1433.6000000000001
well i know dude okay

1433.679 --> 1440.799
wow i'm glad you you're able to define

1437.76 --> 1443.76
other people's feelings about you

1440.799 --> 1447.039
without actually being able to identify

1443.76 --> 1447.039
individuals at it

1448.08 --> 1452.8799999999999
that's great man you just know that's so

1450.64 --> 1452.88
cool

1453.84 --> 1457.84
i mean do you know any freemasons have

1455.679 --> 1461.039
they ever

1457.84 --> 1461.039
given you any like

1461.76 --> 1469.039
vibes like oh there's this [ __ ]

1464.799 --> 1472.0
voynich guy we hate him ever or did you

1469.039 --> 1475.2
just have stupid online trolls that are

1472.0 --> 1477.12
you oh we are freemasons we hate you

1475.2 --> 1480.1200000000001
you believed that did you

1477.12 --> 1480.12
really

1492.0 --> 1497.76
churches police officials

1495.52 --> 1498.84
hate any truth uh

1497.76 --> 1500.4
no

1498.84 --> 1503.52
what

1500.4 --> 1503.52
hate truth

1503.84 --> 1506.799
what

1504.64 --> 1506.7990000000002
no

1507.039 --> 1509.36
it's just

1508.159 --> 1512.48
voynich

1509.36 --> 1516.1589999999999
those functionaries typically

1512.48 --> 1518.64
are not able to do anything with it it's

1516.159 --> 1520.72
not that they hate it it's just that

1518.64 --> 1523.8400000000001
within their function they don't have

1520.72 --> 1525.76
much use for that they tend to ignore it

1523.84 --> 1527.9189999999999
not because they hate it they might get

1525.76 --> 1530.559
annoyed by it because they just can't do

1527.919 --> 1530.5590000000002
anything with it

1530.96 --> 1534.799
i don't hate the truth

1539.919 --> 1544.72
strange assumption there

1542.64 --> 1548.44
low flatter sage

1544.72 --> 1548.44
and terminoid two

1563.2 --> 1567.6000000000001
yeah the hands of skin color tell me oh

1565.2 --> 1571.559
you just found out that's it's been like

1567.6 --> 1571.559
that for over a year

1596.88 --> 1602.8400000000001
oh okay

1599.84 --> 1602.84
hilarious

1623.039 --> 1626.2
all right

1629.279 --> 1632.279
uh

1645.36 --> 1651.12
right so yeah i don't want to get all

1647.36 --> 1651.12
mopey over these people

1652.32 --> 1658.32
so yeah don't get dragged into that i'm

1655.679 --> 1660.159
not mo being mopey it's just like trying

1658.32 --> 1662.6399999999999
to give a warning like i think there's

1660.159 --> 1666.0
gonna be a new rollout of more intense

1662.64 --> 1666.0
psychological warfare

1666.48 --> 1671.3600000000001
and i think we're seeing the starts of

1668.48 --> 1673.919
that already gave an example

1671.36 --> 1675.84
that's it that that's not your starting

1673.919 --> 1678.0800000000002
sign to be

1675.84 --> 1679.279
no oh i'm gonna be

1678.08 --> 1682.32
hate me

1679.279 --> 1685.76
that's not your start sign to just go

1682.32 --> 1687.6789999999999
inward spiraling and be miserable okay

1685.76 --> 1691.679
voynich

1687.679 --> 1693.44
because that's completely useless

1691.679 --> 1697.52
you can't hand

1693.44 --> 1700.8400000000001
them a greater victory than doing that

1697.52 --> 1700.84
so don't

1716.799 --> 1721.679
right oh you ah flatter sage oh you just

1719.44 --> 1724.8400000000001
picked up on that right isn't it isn't

1721.679 --> 1724.8400000000001
it fascinating

1725.2 --> 1728.799
i think i'm really on to something with

1727.039 --> 1731.52
that

1728.799 --> 1734.76
but there isn't really that much to even

1731.52 --> 1734.76
talk about

1738.559 --> 1742.559
right it's

1739.84 --> 1746.36
summarized it can all be said in like

1742.559 --> 1746.36
three or four sentences

1758.799 --> 1763.12
right but apparently you never suspected

1761.52 --> 1765.279
that he might have been replaced that it

1763.12 --> 1768.8799999999999
might not be the same person well i've

1765.279 --> 1770.96
oh i'm an empath so i have very refined

1768.88 --> 1775.3600000000001
senses when it comes to that those kinds

1770.96 --> 1779.559
of things especially through expression

1775.36 --> 1779.559
from people and yeah

1781.279 --> 1785.2
i mean just

1782.96 --> 1787.44
even the way they talked

1785.2 --> 1789.8400000000001
and was recorded early hitler late

1787.44 --> 1792.64
hitcher it's just they talk different

1789.84 --> 1795.84
it's not the same subtlety

1792.64 --> 1795.8400000000001
it's not the same person

1798.32 --> 1803.279
it seems like the later hitler is just a

1801.2 --> 1806.48
larp of himself

1803.279 --> 1808.559
he's just larping like hitler he doesn't

1806.48 --> 1811.6
have the full range

1808.559 --> 1811.6
of abilities

1819.76 --> 1824.96
yeah me telling you about yeah i'm just

1822.159 --> 1826.96
saying voynich

1824.96 --> 1828.88
i'm just trying to warn you

1826.96 --> 1831.2
you're gonna say officials hate any

1828.88 --> 1834.24
truth and no they hate me

1831.2 --> 1837.1200000000001
that is kind of downworld spiral it is

1834.24 --> 1839.2
shouldn't be focusing on that

1837.12 --> 1842.08
you shouldn't even be trying to imagine

1839.2 --> 1843.52
that they do hate you

1842.08 --> 1845.6789999999999
right

1843.52 --> 1848.32
if they do then let them

1845.679 --> 1849.3600000000001
let that let them be drained by their

1848.32 --> 1853.52
hatred

1849.36 --> 1853.52
don't let it drain you why would you

1857.12 --> 1860.4799999999998
hey

1858.64 --> 1863.96
hey thank you susie s for becoming an

1860.48 --> 1863.96
arcane archer

1868.799 --> 1871.799
hmm

1888.96 --> 1893.279
it looks like he's in shape and has less

1891.039 --> 1893.279
hair

1905.279 --> 1907.84
hmm

1917.12 --> 1921.84
okay leg yeah that sounds tough man

1928.88 --> 1935.1200000000001
it was very independent so what has

1932.88 --> 1938.0
truly change is it like his motor

1935.12 --> 1938.8799999999999
motoric skills are still like hampering

1938.0 --> 1942.399
or

1938.88 --> 1942.3990000000001
does he have focus issues

1942.559 --> 1945.76
i mean

1943.519 --> 1947.039
if he just really work at it he could

1945.76 --> 1950.399
still get

1947.039 --> 1952.96
yeah well maybe get back right the only

1950.399 --> 1955.9599999999998
way to retain skills is to train them

1952.96 --> 1955.96
anyway

1967.6 --> 1972.36
but yeah that does sound very tough man

1985.76 --> 1990.2
oh wow really pj cena

1990.559 --> 1996.48
really i didn't even know that

1992.88 --> 2000.519
or maybe i've seen that one

1996.48 --> 2000.519
that is so bizarre

2010.32 --> 2016.84
i just found the join button on the pc

2012.72 --> 2016.84
okay susie yes that's cool

2030.48 --> 2035.1200000000001
gets headaches when he has

2032.72 --> 2037.44
to think about stuff too yeah but what

2035.12 --> 2039.279
what is that thinking about stuff too

2037.44 --> 2041.44
hard

2039.279 --> 2041.44
so

2042.24 --> 2046.96
maybe he has to figure out a way to

2044.64 --> 2049.679
think about stuff shorter and more

2046.96 --> 2049.679
effectively

2050.24 --> 2054.0
i mean if just like

2052.079 --> 2056.32
thinking and like trying to push it

2054.0 --> 2058.159
through well that probably just doesn't

2056.32 --> 2059.76
work anymore

2058.159 --> 2062.639
no wonder right

2059.76 --> 2062.639
you get a headache

2062.96 --> 2067.919
you know what i a couple of

2064.879 --> 2069.679
tricks that i learned is to just never

2067.919 --> 2072.6389999999997
actively think

2069.679 --> 2075.119
just let it happen when it happens

2072.639 --> 2076.879
never try to force

2075.119 --> 2079.839
the thought

2076.879 --> 2079.839
let it just happen

2080.159 --> 2085.2000000000003
and since i've learned to do that my

2082.639 --> 2089.52
thinking has become much smoother much

2085.2 --> 2091.6789999999996
more refined and much higher grade

2089.52 --> 2093.119
all i had to do is stop trying to force

2091.679 --> 2095.839
it

2093.119 --> 2100.8
right just let it happen every time

2095.839 --> 2102.32
just let it be what it is separate of my

2100.8 --> 2105.28
mind

2102.32 --> 2107.04
no it's just the thing it's just how it

2105.28 --> 2110.4
works it's not

2107.04 --> 2112.88
mine it's not mine to command

2110.4 --> 2116.4
i have a responsibility for it i am the

2112.88 --> 2117.28
keeper of it but it isn't mine and

2116.4 --> 2120.56
that's

2117.28 --> 2120.5600000000004
helped me a great deal

2129.44 --> 2134.96
right yeah well if he's got trouble with

2131.839 --> 2137.96
his arm yeah it might i don't know

2134.96 --> 2137.96
tough

2154.48 --> 2160.0
yeah gadgets that's super cool man yeah

2157.44 --> 2162.32
yeah drugs and all that does change you

2160.0 --> 2164.079
does it also change

2162.32 --> 2168.119
your skeleton

2164.079 --> 2168.119
from male to female

2174.72 --> 2181.1189999999997
and besides i think that hitler was

2176.8 --> 2183.599
actually really careful with drugs

2181.119 --> 2185.04
his entire life i mean he's been through

2183.599 --> 2187.52
war and [ __ ]

2185.04 --> 2190.72
he wasn't just like a dying

2187.52 --> 2193.119
veteran junkie at all he was always been

2190.72 --> 2197.2
very careful i think

2193.119 --> 2200.48
until he was switched out with the new

2197.2 --> 2204.16
lesbian hitler

2200.48 --> 2205.68
and when they put that woman on the

2204.16 --> 2207.92
drugs and all that

2205.68 --> 2209.2
they she could not handle it at all and

2207.92 --> 2211.2000000000003
just went

2209.2 --> 2212.8799999999997
completely junky

2211.2 --> 2215.2
so i think that that was probably

2212.88 --> 2217.6800000000003
simultaneously i mean seriously when

2215.2 --> 2220.24
hitler stepped away i really think that

2217.68 --> 2223.44
is the main switch when they just made

2220.24 --> 2225.4399999999996
everything turn into a nightmare

2223.44 --> 2227.599
they just made suddenly introducing

2225.44 --> 2230.079
terrible drugs making people addicted

2227.599 --> 2232.2400000000002
suddenly just introducing

2230.079 --> 2232.2400000000002
like

2232.8 --> 2237.2000000000003
no longer like oh

2234.68 --> 2238.56
superiority and victim consciousness

2237.2 --> 2240.8799999999997
over

2238.56 --> 2243.119
just like national spirit and that kind

2240.88 --> 2246.2400000000002
guy i think that that is when the

2243.119 --> 2247.76
massive amount of when all the poison

2246.24 --> 2250.56
all at once

2247.76 --> 2252.079
was just rolled out after that moment

2250.56 --> 2254.24
when hitler was

2252.079 --> 2257.76
ejected was

2254.24 --> 2259.52
retired to argentina and replaced

2257.76 --> 2263.44
i think that is really the moment when

2259.52 --> 2263.44
they just rolled all of it out

2263.52 --> 2266.52
anyway

2278.88 --> 2281.88
what

2284.48 --> 2289.119
okay so

2286.079 --> 2290.0
that's weird it's not terrible but he's

2289.119 --> 2293.6800000000003
lost

2290.0 --> 2296.16
at least his arm can still move then

2293.68 --> 2297.359
it's just that he he seems to have lost

2296.16 --> 2300.7999999999997
temp

2297.359 --> 2300.7999999999997
conscious control over it

2301.28 --> 2306.6400000000003
but at least it can move i mean

2304.24 --> 2309.359
that's good that means that potentially

2306.64 --> 2311.5989999999997
he could get it under control again

2309.359 --> 2313.92
i mean if he could just never move it

2311.599 --> 2315.3590000000004
then you're screwed because then yeah

2313.92 --> 2317.76
then it's probably completely

2315.359 --> 2320.56
disconnected

2317.76 --> 2322.6400000000003
so yeah look recovery

2320.56 --> 2326.839
from a serious stroke can be

2322.64 --> 2326.839
extremely trying

2331.68 --> 2336.3199999999997
i mean especially if there is a lot of

2334.4 --> 2338.7200000000003
success rate

2336.32 --> 2341.76
possible if there's room for growth and

2338.72 --> 2344.0789999999997
improvement you don't get it just that

2341.76 --> 2345.599
easy it's going to be very tough it

2344.079 --> 2347.3590000000004
always is

2345.599 --> 2350.0
without the toughness there is no

2347.359 --> 2350.0
recovery

2351.359 --> 2358.16
right and a lot of it is psychological

2354.48 --> 2358.16
it is like consciously

2358.24 --> 2363.52
snap being re-snapped into your body

2361.28 --> 2365.76
getting close again to your weaknesses

2363.52 --> 2367.119
and your age and just like and now you

2365.76 --> 2370.0
gotta do it

2367.119 --> 2372.1600000000003
you've got to be fully determined again

2370.0 --> 2373.92
when before when everything just goes

2372.16 --> 2375.839
automatically you don't really have to

2373.92 --> 2380.119
be that conscious

2375.839 --> 2380.119
so it's going to be very trying

2384.72 --> 2387.5989999999997
seeing that yeah

2389.52 --> 2393.52
medical devices around

2391.44 --> 2396.8
well it's up to him

2393.52 --> 2400.4
it's all up to him i mean

2396.8 --> 2401.6800000000003
in his mind it could be forever

2400.4 --> 2403.76
he could be

2401.68 --> 2405.9199999999996
getting desperate and trying to imagine

2403.76 --> 2407.76
how this is going to be his end

2405.92 --> 2410.7200000000003
or he could be like

2407.76 --> 2412.48
try to get sharp stay real and realize

2410.72 --> 2415.2799999999997
now this is all temporary it's going to

2412.48 --> 2415.28
be very tough

2417.119 --> 2422.1600000000003
if you just don't despair that's the

2419.76 --> 2425.44
most important part do not give in to

2422.16 --> 2427.7599999999998
despair not even internally

2425.44 --> 2430.0
and then you might just be able to get

2427.76 --> 2432.3190000000004
out of it and and have your strength

2430.0 --> 2432.319
again

2432.96 --> 2437.8
anyway

2434.16 --> 2437.7999999999997
it's gonna be tough

2461.839 --> 2464.56
what the [ __ ]

2465.119 --> 2470.1600000000003
oh my god no not mike tyson

2468.64 --> 2473.68
he didn't

2470.16 --> 2473.68
just [ __ ] idiot

2474.079 --> 2477.96
[ __ ] idiot

2480.72 --> 2485.1189999999997
can't believe

2482.079 --> 2488.8390000000004
that he actually did that what a god

2485.119 --> 2488.839
damn idiot

2499.44 --> 2502.96
my dad watches for okay

2503.119 --> 2506.2000000000003
all right

2510.0 --> 2514.96
right

2511.44 --> 2517.599
but just remember the key

2514.96 --> 2519.44
it's going to be very tough to recover

2517.599 --> 2521.04
from that

2519.44 --> 2522.7200000000003
you're going to need your full

2521.04 --> 2524.72
consciousness it's going to be like a

2522.72 --> 2526.56
test like you're really young again

2524.72 --> 2530.56
except now you're old

2526.56 --> 2535.119
you got to do it you got to do it

2530.56 --> 2535.119
and you cannot allow yourself to despair

2535.2 --> 2540.7999999999997
to do that if you let weakness in

2538.16 --> 2543.52
through that process it's not gonna heal

2540.8 --> 2545.28
if you throw off this fair

2543.52 --> 2547.52
it can

2545.28 --> 2549.3590000000004
and you can even get like a little bit

2547.52 --> 2552.64
of your your

2549.359 --> 2554.88
youth spirit back

2552.64 --> 2556.64
anyway

2554.88 --> 2557.6800000000003
but it's gonna be a

2556.64 --> 2560.68
very

2557.68 --> 2560.68
trying

2577.68 --> 2582.839
oh god really cinch man oh gross

2600.96 --> 2603.96
hmm

2628.48 --> 2632.48
that you'd inspect what are you talking

2630.24 --> 2632.4799999999996
about

2633.68 --> 2636.68
what

2655.44 --> 2661.04
what did mike do i don't know somebody

2657.44 --> 2665.599
in chat said that he actually had like a

2661.04 --> 2665.599
a really bad reaction to taking a jab

2666.64 --> 2672.56
i don't know if that is actually true

2668.64 --> 2674.56
but i i'm gonna take their word on it

2672.56 --> 2677.56
that's true then yeah that's extremely

2674.56 --> 2677.56
disappointing

2677.76 --> 2683.96
you said it

2679.599 --> 2683.96
a lot of things being said

2696.56 --> 2702.24
what was it

2699.119 --> 2705.839
yeah matthew hall said that

2702.24 --> 2705.839
like four minutes ago

2735.52 --> 2739.0
just yeah

2768.319 --> 2775.119
yeah

2769.28 --> 2779.2000000000003
it's similar look pgcnet guys i really

2775.119 --> 2781.599
do not understand why the [ __ ]

2779.2 --> 2784.24
these people do that i mean

2781.599 --> 2787.3590000000004
are you suicidal

2784.24 --> 2788.3999999999996
i mean are you literally suicidal and

2787.359 --> 2790.24
you're like

2788.4 --> 2792.96
i'm gonna take this shot because

2790.24 --> 2795.4399999999996
everybody tells me i should and the tv

2792.96 --> 2798.7200000000003
and everything tells me i should even if

2795.44 --> 2801.599
it kills me i'm gonna just do that

2798.72 --> 2803.839
like why the [ __ ] would you do that why

2801.599 --> 2806.0
don't you then just instead pick up a

2803.839 --> 2809.359
gun and blast your own [ __ ] brains

2806.0 --> 2813.44
out like why the [ __ ] would you give

2809.359 --> 2817.839
money to satan the ultimate evil the

2813.44 --> 2819.119
ultimate overtly uncloaked evil

2817.839 --> 2822.319
money

2819.119 --> 2826.079
to potentially kill yourself under the

2822.319 --> 2828.64
guise of a complete misleading story

2826.079 --> 2832.6400000000003
that doesn't even have any foundation

2828.64 --> 2834.24
whatsoever why the [ __ ] would you do

2832.64 --> 2836.48
that now

2834.24 --> 2839.7599999999998
then why don't you just [ __ ] kill

2836.48 --> 2841.119
yourself instead just do that then you

2839.76 --> 2843.599
[ __ ]

2841.119 --> 2845.119
you can't handle the [ __ ] reality

2843.599 --> 2846.7200000000003
then just do

2845.119 --> 2850.559
that

2846.72 --> 2853.04
don't get the [ __ ] shot you're

2850.559 --> 2856.559
literally contributing to the

2853.04 --> 2862.68
psychological slaughter of humanity you

2856.559 --> 2862.6800000000003
satanic [ __ ] slave idiot

2882.28 --> 2888.8
i can't believe that freaking mike tyson

2886.72 --> 2891.4399999999996
of all would do that

2888.8 --> 2893.599
i can't believe he's that [ __ ]

2891.44 --> 2897.319
[ __ ]

2893.599 --> 2897.319
i mean just

2904.0 --> 2909.44
yeah voynich

2906.64 --> 2911.44
shut the [ __ ] up voynich i'm gonna kick

2909.44 --> 2912.2400000000002
you out you get it

2911.44 --> 2914.4
yeah

2912.24 --> 2916.8799999999997
i have the

2914.4 --> 2919.119
right to do this

2916.88 --> 2920.48
on my show

2919.119 --> 2921.839
and you

2920.48 --> 2922.8
in chat

2921.839 --> 2924.24
do

2922.8 --> 2926.48
not

2924.24 --> 2930.24
do you understand

2926.48 --> 2932.72
you have no equal right

2930.24 --> 2934.8799999999997
to what i do

2932.72 --> 2938.7999999999997
on my live show

2934.88 --> 2942.6400000000003
in the chat and if you can't handle that

2938.8 --> 2948.1600000000003
for any conceivable reason then you need

2942.64 --> 2952.04
to [ __ ] off or shut the [ __ ] up

2948.16 --> 2952.04
do you hear me voynich

2956.96 --> 2959.96
um

2979.359 --> 2985.2799999999997
i choose to [ __ ] blow up then i will

2982.4 --> 2988.2400000000002
blow up

2985.28 --> 2988.2400000000002
because i have a point

2988.88 --> 2995.52
yeah and i'm not

2991.52 --> 2996.839
rolling towards despair it's outrage

2995.52 --> 2998.48
it's freaking

2996.839 --> 3000.319
outrage

2998.48 --> 3002.0
yeah

3000.319 --> 3003.92
with a purpose

3002.0 --> 3006.16
with a target

3003.92 --> 3008.8
with an end result that

3006.16 --> 3011.2799999999997
in my view is constructive despite the

3008.8 --> 3014.1600000000003
intensity yeah that's not the same thing

3011.28 --> 3014.1600000000003
as moping

3015.599 --> 3020.079
yeah yeah that's [ __ ] useless and i

3017.839 --> 3022.48
do not tolerate it yeah if somebody's

3020.079 --> 3025.52
like that in my chat i point it out and

3022.48 --> 3027.92
you're gonna correct it

3025.52 --> 3031.28
and if you then proceed to complain

3027.92 --> 3033.119
about how i get pissed off and very loud

3031.28 --> 3035.599
on my own show

3033.119 --> 3039.2000000000003
towards another person who i think did

3035.599 --> 3041.44
something incredibly monstrously stupid

3039.2 --> 3043.359
then you have a problem

3041.44 --> 3046.16
because you do not have the right to

3043.359 --> 3048.5589999999997
complain about that

3046.16 --> 3051.04
you have the right however to tap out

3048.559 --> 3053.0400000000004
and [ __ ] off if you don't like it that's

3051.04 --> 3055.839
your right

3053.04 --> 3055.839
you understand

3075.92 --> 3079.04
now you get it good

3080.64 --> 3086.2799999999997
adapt or leave

3082.8 --> 3086.28
no more attitude

3103.359 --> 3108.5589999999997
okay you're gone now get the [ __ ] out

3106.4 --> 3110.96
you compulsive

3108.559 --> 3113.119
idiot

3110.96 --> 3116.16
so that's the reason i banned you the

3113.119 --> 3117.839
first time too this guy cannot shut the

3116.16 --> 3120.64
[ __ ] up

3117.839 --> 3120.64
no he has to do it

3122.079 --> 3126.6400000000003
so he's going to stand in the corner for

3123.92 --> 3126.64
15 minutes

3126.72 --> 3131.68
gamma gamma [ __ ]

3129.599 --> 3133.92
gamma [ __ ]

3131.68 --> 3136.839
[ __ ]

3133.92 --> 3140.96
no control over your

3136.839 --> 3145.52
impulses petty social maneuvering

3140.96 --> 3151.16
of a preteen that does not have control

3145.52 --> 3151.16
over themselves and now you're banned

3180.88 --> 3183.839
yeah

3181.839 --> 3186.24
because if you don't like it you think

3183.839 --> 3191.119
it's unfair you feel i'm being treated

3186.24 --> 3193.5989999999997
unfairly hurt then you [ __ ] step away

3191.119 --> 3197.599
you step away

3193.599 --> 3200.7200000000003
you shut the [ __ ] up and you step away

3197.599 --> 3202.8
you let it slip you let it cool off and

3200.72 --> 3204.0789999999997
then you continue back to business

3202.8 --> 3206.319
because if you then just start in the

3204.079 --> 3206.319
corner

3207.04 --> 3211.68
yeah guess what's gonna happen

3208.96 --> 3214.0
you you think you can just do that like

3211.68 --> 3215.839
no i can still just do that i could just

3214.0 --> 3218.319
still be

3215.839 --> 3220.72
in the corner it just nobody's gonna see

3218.319 --> 3223.2799999999997
it except i'm doing it in plain sight

3220.72 --> 3227.2799999999997
because you're insane when you do that

3223.28 --> 3229.3590000000004
insane rambling gamma huh yeah yeah so

3227.28 --> 3230.6400000000003
if you do that here you're gonna get

3229.359 --> 3232.7999999999997
kicked out

3230.64 --> 3235.2799999999997
so don't do that here

3232.8 --> 3238.4
if you can't handle what i'm doing

3235.28 --> 3241.92
you feel unfairly treated

3238.4 --> 3244.0
shut the [ __ ] up for a few moments step

3241.92 --> 3247.2000000000003
away if you can't handle it

3244.0 --> 3247.2
get back to business

3250.48 --> 3256.319
this is not random this is not wild

3254.16 --> 3259.04
it is wild in a way

3256.319 --> 3261.68
but i'm not doing this like a feral

3259.04 --> 3264.319
person that's just randomly throwing

3261.68 --> 3266.24
things no i'm doing this with a very

3264.319 --> 3268.4
specific structure here

3266.24 --> 3270.8799999999997
with order

3268.4 --> 3274.7200000000003
and i will not have

3270.88 --> 3279.559
people in my chat full out of line i

3274.72 --> 3279.5589999999997
will not accept it

3290.48 --> 3294.48
yeah i know rick beck

3292.4 --> 3296.2400000000002
and it's annoying because

3294.48 --> 3298.319
there's things about voynich that i

3296.24 --> 3301.52
actually like

3298.319 --> 3304.4
and then he just can't help himself

3301.52 --> 3306.64
i i don't is this a [ __ ] dutch thing

3304.4 --> 3308.64
dutch sailor had that too it's like a

3306.64 --> 3310.96
lot of dutch people out there they just

3308.64 --> 3313.839
can't handle me they all turn into

3310.96 --> 3316.0
whimpering stuttering gammas for some

3313.839 --> 3318.319
reason in the face of me

3316.0 --> 3321.28
why i don't get it why do you always

3318.319 --> 3322.48
have to turn into stuttering whimpering

3321.28 --> 3324.2400000000002
gammas

3322.48 --> 3327.92
stop being a [ __ ]

3324.24 --> 3329.359
stand up straight chin up

3327.92 --> 3331.04
silence

3329.359 --> 3333.04
pay attention

3331.04 --> 3335.359
stop whimpering

3333.04 --> 3338.079
stop mumbling

3335.359 --> 3341.0789999999997
stand straight up pay attention

3338.079 --> 3341.079
silence

3360.559 --> 3364.96
all right by the way i've never even

3362.96 --> 3368.559
talked to anybody like that straight to

3364.96 --> 3368.559
their face i don't go there

3372.079 --> 3377.2000000000003
i do that in a sub level so i don't say

3375.359 --> 3381.119
these things then literally

3377.2 --> 3381.1189999999997
i just infer them

3382.64 --> 3386.96
i just show them okay you're not doing

3384.64 --> 3390.0789999999997
good right now oh oh this is really

3386.96 --> 3392.48
awesome you seem to be

3390.079 --> 3395.44
seeing it you're getting it oh now

3392.48 --> 3395.44
you're not getting it

3395.52 --> 3400.88
encourage discourage

3398.16 --> 3401.839
that's what i do person in yeah face to

3400.88 --> 3404.079
face

3401.839 --> 3406.64
i don't literally go drilling somebody

3404.079 --> 3407.799
like a drill sergeant

3406.64 --> 3411.52
but that is

3407.799 --> 3413.2
metaphorically spiritually arguably

3411.52 --> 3415.7599999999998
what i do do

3413.2 --> 3417.68
over here

3415.76 --> 3420.079
because this is the internet

3417.68 --> 3422.16
and this is a live stream

3420.079 --> 3424.88
and i have to

3422.16 --> 3427.839
show you something so i'm showing you my

3424.88 --> 3430.0
internal workings expressed

3427.839 --> 3432.0789999999997
into

3430.0 --> 3434.48
live communication

3432.079 --> 3436.6400000000003
in a way you could almost say

3434.48 --> 3440.559
i'm writing a story

3436.64 --> 3440.5589999999997
like a movie or a cartoon

3441.92 --> 3447.119
except it's

3443.44 --> 3449.119
it's all life it's like being all made

3447.119 --> 3451.599
life right in front of you instead of

3449.119 --> 3454.319
like in a studio with like

3451.599 --> 3458.04
years and years of time

3454.319 --> 3458.04
preparing it all

3460.319 --> 3463.319
anyways

3478.16 --> 3481.319
all right

3499.2 --> 3502.2
uh

3504.0 --> 3508.72
yes susie i don't know how they're

3505.839 --> 3510.48
surviving i cannot imagine what it would

3508.72 --> 3511.5989999999997
be like to not

3510.48 --> 3515.799
know

3511.599 --> 3515.799
that there is a creator designer

3516.16 --> 3522.0789999999997
i mean i've always known even when i was

3519.68 --> 3525.2799999999997
basically solipsist

3522.079 --> 3528.559
i mean you can't be totally solipsist

3525.28 --> 3530.559
because there's always still god

3528.559 --> 3533.2000000000003
it's like no matter where i went no

3530.559 --> 3536.4
matter how atheistic no matter how even

3533.2 --> 3539.359
like demonic and like anti-human

3536.4 --> 3541.839
i would simulate it's just you can never

3539.359 --> 3545.119
get rid of god because he is there i

3541.839 --> 3546.4
don't understand how people can just not

3545.119 --> 3548.48
see it

3546.4 --> 3551.76
because i've always seen it

3548.48 --> 3553.359
from the very first moment i awoke

3551.76 --> 3556.4
in this world

3553.359 --> 3559.119
just always it's always there i've just

3556.4 --> 3561.44
it's taken a while before i could

3559.119 --> 3564.4
properly translate

3561.44 --> 3564.4
my perceptions

3568.319 --> 3573.839
do you think they will fake engineer pro

3571.119 --> 3573.839
no

3582.24 --> 3586.839
i mean why why would they do that

3586.88 --> 3590.1600000000003
i mean why would they need to do that i

3588.64 --> 3591.5989999999997
mean if they're gonna fake blow

3590.16 --> 3594.0
something up that means they're gonna

3591.599 --> 3597.839
have to fake blow something up if they

3594.0 --> 3600.72
just do everything as supposedly said

3597.839 --> 3603.359
then they don't even have to do anything

3600.72 --> 3606.64
they can just cgi some stupid little

3603.359 --> 3606.64
rocket very cheaply

3607.119 --> 3610.96
and then show you all the photoshopped

3609.04 --> 3612.319
images that they want you to believe

3610.96 --> 3613.599
came out of there

3612.319 --> 3615.52
that's it

3613.599 --> 3617.28
i mean why would they blow something up

3615.52 --> 3620.64
that means they would actually have to

3617.28 --> 3620.6400000000003
physically do something

3621.76 --> 3629.44
i mean they're not going to be able to

3623.76 --> 3630.48
like make a rocket blow up seem real

3629.44 --> 3632.799
that's

3630.48 --> 3636.559
like i don't

3632.799 --> 3636.559
it would always be spotted

3636.72 --> 3642.799
i mean having a rocket or something fly

3640.0 --> 3647.28
is one thing to do that in cgi but to

3642.799 --> 3649.68
like an explosion is something else

3647.28 --> 3652.799
i mean in the movies they can make it

3649.68 --> 3655.5989999999997
seem pretty damn real but then when you

3652.799 --> 3657.72
compare it to a real thing that really

3655.599 --> 3661.599
happened and was caught on camera you

3657.72 --> 3664.9599999999996
immediately see like oh [ __ ] no this

3661.599 --> 3667.599
this is the real explosion you just

3664.96 --> 3670.2400000000002
because they can't simulate they just

3667.599 --> 3672.079
can't do it they can simulate something

3670.24 --> 3674.16
and you will believe like oh that's an

3672.079 --> 3676.7200000000003
explosion but

3674.16 --> 3678.5589999999997
it's nothing like a real explosion in

3676.72 --> 3681.4399999999996
the real physical world being filmed

3678.559 --> 3685.28
it's so different

3681.44 --> 3687.359
it's just not the same thing

3685.28 --> 3689.3590000000004
and you would see that but if you just

3687.359 --> 3691.44
let everything go according to plan then

3689.359 --> 3694.0789999999997
you can just cgi at all you don't even

3691.44 --> 3696.839
have to build a freaking model to fake

3694.079 --> 3700.7200000000003
it i mean that's the ultimate money

3696.839 --> 3700.72
savings they could have like

3700.799 --> 3706.72
what is it

3702.44 --> 3711.319
89.9 billion profit

3706.72 --> 3711.319
instead of 80 billion profit

3713.839 --> 3718.0789999999997
i'd say yeah why blow it up

3716.72 --> 3720.72
i mean

3718.079 --> 3723.119
was it again the challenger blew up well

3720.72 --> 3725.7599999999998
they it blew up for a political reason

3723.119 --> 3727.76
because they wanted the space program to

3725.76 --> 3730.079
be discontinued

3727.76 --> 3731.92
they wanted it to stop that's why they

3730.079 --> 3735.119
blew it up right

3731.92 --> 3738.079
that's like a literal reason a driver a

3735.119 --> 3740.799
driving influence to the public why they

3738.079 --> 3742.079
did it why would they do that now

3740.799 --> 3745.28
do they want

3742.079 --> 3747.28
it to discontinue all this really no i

3745.28 --> 3750.559
think quite the opposite

3747.28 --> 3753.52
they want to dig into fake space

3750.559 --> 3756.4
simulation with huge money influx more

3753.52 --> 3759.28
than ever before because people are more

3756.4 --> 3762.4
[ __ ] on average now

3759.28 --> 3764.1600000000003
and there's just huge amount of money

3762.4 --> 3766.96
going around

3764.16 --> 3768.64
to waste so i don't think they want to

3766.96 --> 3771.839
blow it up i don't think they want to

3768.64 --> 3773.359
blow any rocket up

3771.839 --> 3776.4
because they definitely don't want to

3773.359 --> 3776.4
discontinue it

3776.72 --> 3783.839
that's what i think

3779.359 --> 3783.839
hey robin stanley good to see you again

3802.72 --> 3808.16
oh really did you see it

3805.119 --> 3809.119
countdown crack okay well that might

3808.16 --> 3811.1189999999997
happen

3809.119 --> 3814.0
i mean that's just like a stalling

3811.119 --> 3816.319
tactic right i mean they

3814.0 --> 3817.76
launch just not going through with it oh

3816.319 --> 3820.319
there's something wrong we have to do it

3817.76 --> 3823.2000000000003
again yeah that that's routine business

3820.319 --> 3826.4
that used to happen all the time

3823.2 --> 3827.9199999999996
during the supposed space race it's like

3826.4 --> 3829.839
oh double check oh [ __ ] there's

3827.92 --> 3831.039
something wrong oh we have to we have to

3829.839 --> 3832.799
abort

3831.039 --> 3834.88
and figure out what's wrong and then

3832.799 --> 3837.88
like a month later or something they try

3834.88 --> 3837.88
again

3843.119 --> 3848.6400000000003
yes injured it always cuts

3845.68 --> 3853.1189999999997
there is no continual footage

3848.64 --> 3854.96
from ground into space there is no

3853.119 --> 3856.1600000000003
footage

3854.96 --> 3858.64
and

3856.16 --> 3860.8799999999997
that's a real tragedy for globe earth

3858.64 --> 3863.92
believers because i mean it would only

3860.88 --> 3864.96
take just one real

3863.92 --> 3867.119
video

3864.96 --> 3870.0
that was actually live film there's

3867.119 --> 3873.359
probably not photoshop

3870.0 --> 3875.599
off the ground up to deep space

3873.359 --> 3877.92
where you would literally see the ball

3875.599 --> 3880.6400000000003
earth in the distance

3877.92 --> 3882.0
but there is no shot they haven't even

3880.64 --> 3885.0389999999998
attempted

3882.0 --> 3888.0
to see gi such a thing

3885.039 --> 3889.5200000000004
like there is no movie or no star trek

3888.0 --> 3890.88
episode

3889.52 --> 3892.4
no space

3890.88 --> 3894.48
thing

3892.4 --> 3896.96
in movie world

3894.48 --> 3899.92
where they do that they haven't done

3896.96 --> 3902.48
that a single time

3899.92 --> 3904.88
even though they could have done that

3902.48 --> 3908.4
admittedly with cgi because of course

3904.88 --> 3910.4
people know that movies are fake

3908.4 --> 3913.119
i've done it they haven't done it why

3910.4 --> 3915.599
would they not do it probably because if

3913.119 --> 3917.44
they tried it and they showed it to you

3915.599 --> 3920.319
even if you were a globe believer you

3917.44 --> 3922.96
would be so shocked about how incredibly

3920.319 --> 3925.599
fake it looked that you would literally

3922.96 --> 3927.68
just get an aneurysm or just snap out of

3925.599 --> 3930.6400000000003
the globe belief immediately realize

3927.68 --> 3932.8799999999997
like this is so wrong

3930.64 --> 3937.799
it's not a globe

3932.88 --> 3937.799
it might be that shocking if you saw it

3944.799 --> 3949.0389999999998
right it is really hard to make cgi look

3946.72 --> 3951.2
real that's why the best cgi is always

3949.039 --> 3952.48
used sparingly in movies

3951.2 --> 3955.1189999999997
right

3952.48 --> 3958.2400000000002
you do practical effects

3955.119 --> 3960.319
and then you you put a little cgi just a

3958.24 --> 3961.839
half a second or a couple of seconds in

3960.319 --> 3965.839
between

3961.839 --> 3968.48
to fill it out but not to be the center

3965.839 --> 3970.16
of attention right if cgi becomes the

3968.48 --> 3971.839
center of attention which well with a

3970.16 --> 3973.52
rocket launch and all that would it

3971.839 --> 3976.64
would be

3973.52 --> 3979.839
well then it's much tougher

3976.64 --> 3982.8799999999997
if you have cgi on the side right on the

3979.839 --> 3986.0
side where you're not actually looking

3982.88 --> 3988.1600000000003
then it doesn't matter super much as to

3986.0 --> 3990.319
what is actually happening there because

3988.16 --> 3992.24
your attention won't be so focused on it

3990.319 --> 3993.2799999999997
to see like oh wait this doesn't look

3992.24 --> 3996.319
real

3993.28 --> 3999.44
right that's the right way to apply it

3996.319 --> 4004.079
that's why in movies the best movies

3999.44 --> 4004.079
are the ones where cgi is used sparingly

4004.72 --> 4009.9199999999996
like those make the best impressions

4007.92 --> 4011.76
and then you can actually like look it

4009.92 --> 4013.359
and look at again and just like try to

4011.76 --> 4016.0
spot the cgi and it will be kind of

4013.359 --> 4017.44
tough even to do that then

4016.0 --> 4018.799
because they've gotten really good at

4017.44 --> 4020.559
that

4018.799 --> 4024.319
that form of application but if you're

4020.559 --> 4027.039
going to make a pure cgi spectacle

4024.319 --> 4029.52
and then claim it's real

4027.039 --> 4032.8390000000004
much more difficult especially when it

4029.52 --> 4034.48
concerns explosions because explosion is

4032.839 --> 4035.52
just

4034.48 --> 4037.119
it is

4035.52 --> 4040.799
it's something else

4037.119 --> 4043.119
something like really visceral and

4040.799 --> 4044.88
you can't cgi that

4043.119 --> 4047.88
you'll you'll be able to tell it's not

4044.88 --> 4047.88
real

4052.24 --> 4057.1189999999997
all right and maybe that's good enough i

4054.079 --> 4059.28
mean in a drawing disaster movie and

4057.119 --> 4061.119
something really big blows up i mean

4059.28 --> 4063.119
you're still gonna be like excited for

4061.119 --> 4065.2000000000003
in the movie and all that you know it's

4063.119 --> 4066.96
fake and you're not going to be like oh

4065.2 --> 4068.64
is that real is that real explosion does

4066.96 --> 4070.64
that look real no because you're not

4068.64 --> 4073.0389999999998
anticipating it to be real because

4070.64 --> 4074.96
you're in a movie in a movie with

4073.039 --> 4077.8390000000004
explosions so you're anticipating oh

4074.96 --> 4078.96
yeah blow up yeah boom oh fireball whoo

4077.839 --> 4081.0389999999998
cool

4078.96 --> 4082.799
auction yay

4081.039 --> 4085.2000000000003
but you're not looking

4082.799 --> 4087.44
like oh is it real does it actually look

4085.2 --> 4089.5989999999997
like that no no

4087.44 --> 4092.4
if you're gonna fake something though

4089.599 --> 4094.96
like a rocket explosion

4092.4 --> 4097.52
yeah that's claimed to be real so people

4094.96 --> 4098.799
then are gonna actually look at it and

4097.52 --> 4100.159000000001
be like

4098.799 --> 4102.239
hmm

4100.159 --> 4103.839
did that really blow up

4102.239 --> 4106.639999999999
there's something really weird about

4103.839 --> 4108.64
what i just looked at

4106.64 --> 4111.4400000000005
because they're not anticipating it to

4108.64 --> 4114.64
be a movie with fakery and

4111.44 --> 4114.639999999999
it's supposed to be real

4116.239 --> 4119.239
anyway

4123.359 --> 4130.400000000001
right so i don't anticipate

4125.6 --> 4130.400000000001
like space projects blowing up any

4130.839 --> 4135.44
rockets i mean how many times has that

4133.44 --> 4137.5199999999995
even happened i mean there's been a

4135.44 --> 4141.759
rocket accident right where they like

4137.52 --> 4141.759
blow up just on the platform and [ __ ]

4143.199 --> 4146.96
but as far as i know like the challenger

4145.44 --> 4149.04
was the only

4146.96 --> 4150.4800000000005
rocket where actual astronauts got

4149.04 --> 4152.08
killed

4150.48 --> 4154.48
and it was actually a rocket and

4152.08 --> 4157.12
everything in this supposed shuttle that

4154.48 --> 4161.639999999999
blew up in mid-air

4157.12 --> 4161.64
it's the only one i've ever seen

4183.839 --> 4188.839
oh it's a test launch oh goody

4190.08 --> 4195.679
see your explosions are easy yeah but

4192.0 --> 4195.679
you will be able to tell it's fake

4197.44 --> 4202.48
i know cgi explosion yes you you could

4200.159 --> 4204.719
live like apps on your phone where you

4202.48 --> 4207.599999999999
can just like oh here boom

4204.719 --> 4209.52
oh what type of explosion do you want

4207.6 --> 4212.56
a detonation

4209.52 --> 4215.679
a gas explosion or a nuke yes i know

4212.56 --> 4216.96
there's cgi apps for all that [ __ ]

4215.679 --> 4220.56
yeah

4216.96 --> 4224.2390000000005
that doesn't make it look real

4220.56 --> 4227.4400000000005
you will still be able to tell it's cgi

4224.239 --> 4230.879999999999
because a real actual explosion being

4227.44 --> 4231.839999999999
filmed from the real world those are

4230.88 --> 4234.32
just

4231.84 --> 4234.32
unique

4234.96 --> 4241.36
you can tell like that's a real one

4238.8 --> 4244.159000000001
all that shit's just missing

4241.36 --> 4248.0
from cgi

4244.159 --> 4251.0
just there to represent the explosion it

4248.0 --> 4251.0
isn't

4276.159 --> 4281.759999999999
spacex has been caught doing cgi yeah

4279.199 --> 4281.759999999999
a lot of them

4281.92 --> 4286.52
spacex and blue origin

4286.88 --> 4293.52
yeah definitely

4289.199 --> 4293.5199999999995
but not explosion cgi

4298.96 --> 4302.4
their ceo told us

4302.88 --> 4305.28
diddy

4305.36 --> 4308.36
okay

4325.92 --> 4331.679
something is real is actually cgi can

4328.239 --> 4331.678999999999
you cite the time changer

4332.4 --> 4336.08
he tweeted it hilarious

4337.84 --> 4342.8
yeah i believe elon would probably do

4340.08 --> 4344.8
that

4342.8 --> 4347.12
right but it's also kind of blatantly

4344.8 --> 4349.679
obvious there hill to the chef i mean

4347.12 --> 4349.679
serious

4352.64 --> 4359.84
you don't care about musk or twitter

4356.08 --> 4359.84
can you be more specific that's

4360.0 --> 4364.239
he was

4362.239 --> 4366.718999999999
and if you don't care about that so it

4364.239 --> 4368.799999999999
doesn't matter then

4366.719 --> 4370.88
so then it's not admitted so if it's

4368.8 --> 4372.8
elon musk or it's on twitter then it's

4370.88 --> 4377.8
not an admission you say hell to the

4372.8 --> 4377.8
chef it's a very weird standard

4386.32 --> 4392.0
right besides it's blatantly obvious

4388.32 --> 4396.96
they use cgi with this stupid re-landing

4392.0 --> 4396.96
rocket i mean that is all cgi

4397.36 --> 4403.159
there's no way

4399.6 --> 4403.159000000001
that that's real

4414.32 --> 4418.96
oh you don't care means i'm not aware of

4417.12 --> 4420.719
what was said well maybe the next time

4418.96 --> 4422.88
you should just say i'm not aware of

4420.719 --> 4425.92
what was said instead of i don't care

4422.88 --> 4427.84
because those things absolutely don't

4425.92 --> 4429.84
mean the same thing they are not even

4427.84 --> 4433.159000000001
close to synonymous

4429.84 --> 4433.159000000001
that's okay

4451.36 --> 4458.04
just stop digging whole heal to the chef

4454.88 --> 4458.04
just stop

4475.6 --> 4480.8
yeah okay matthew but everybody laughed

4478.0 --> 4480.8
after that i mean

4481.52 --> 4486.320000000001
you know it's real because

4483.76 --> 4489.92
because it looks so fake is now like one

4486.32 --> 4489.92
of his famous sayings

4490.96 --> 4494.4
i mean it is

4493.199 --> 4497.44
i mean

4494.4 --> 4499.28
anybody in the world right now

4497.44 --> 4501.44
anybody i mean like

4499.28 --> 4504.159
any one of the seven billion people or

4501.44 --> 4506.32
however the [ __ ] there are

4504.159 --> 4509.879999999999
how many i don't know

4506.32 --> 4509.88
just ask them

4510.08 --> 4516.5599999999995
me one quote from elon musk

4513.92 --> 4516.56
that you know

4518.48 --> 4523.599999999999
well of all the people that have

4520.8 --> 4525.76
actually heard who that is right they

4523.6 --> 4529.679
actually know about elon probably

4525.76 --> 4532.56
through the tv or something or the new

4529.679 --> 4534.64
television or

4532.56 --> 4535.92
or through internet

4534.64 --> 4541.4400000000005
they're all

4535.92 --> 4544.08
gonna say probably like 95 plus

4541.44 --> 4547.36
you know it's real because it looks so

4544.08 --> 4548.5599999999995
fake because that is now his most famous

4547.36 --> 4551.12
quote

4548.56 --> 4553.84
it is it like everybody knows he said

4551.12 --> 4553.84
that

4557.199 --> 4562.799999999999
i mean do you know anything else

4560.32 --> 4565.12
that he said that's actually interesting

4562.8 --> 4569.1990000000005
and like really worth quoting

4565.12 --> 4570.88
no i just know it looks so real

4569.199 --> 4573.919999999999
you know it's real because it looks so

4570.88 --> 4576.719
fake that is like the thing he said and

4573.92 --> 4579.04
everybody now knows it

4576.719 --> 4580.64
i mean nobody knows whatever the [ __ ] he

4579.04 --> 4582.239
said other than that because most of the

4580.64 --> 4584.320000000001
time it's just

4582.239 --> 4587.599999999999
it's just not interesting

4584.32 --> 4591.88
and he talks it's just not interesting

4587.6 --> 4591.88
and he said that that was interesting

4595.36 --> 4601.5199999999995
i don't know about that bjc net i don't

4597.44 --> 4601.5199999999995
know if glovers actually believe it

4603.28 --> 4607.36
i think that even the general public is

4605.52 --> 4609.6
just like

4607.36 --> 4612.239
okay

4609.6 --> 4615.360000000001
right

4612.239 --> 4616.639999999999
i don't know why he's doing that

4615.36 --> 4619.639999999999
but

4616.64 --> 4619.64
whatever

4625.92 --> 4629.4800000000005
yeah what's that

4637.44 --> 4644.44
oh it's much easier to do this

4640.32 --> 4644.44
cgi that way huh

4651.6 --> 4657.56
wow

4653.6 --> 4657.56
that is pretty amazing

4673.92 --> 4678.28
i mean that's pretty remarkable

4678.48 --> 4683.04
i mean if he's seeing things like that

4680.32 --> 4685.44
is he just like in plain sight telling

4683.04 --> 4688.64
you this is all a magician's trick

4685.44 --> 4688.639999999999
is he just saying that

4699.52 --> 4704.2390000000005
we have it's photoshop because it has to

4701.84 --> 4705.1990000000005
be yeah but that was not elon that was

4704.239 --> 4706.718999999999
the

4705.199 --> 4710.0
well

4706.719 --> 4714.4800000000005
the guy that like edited

4710.0 --> 4714.48
the photos of earth and all that

4715.12 --> 4718.36
for nasa

4738.4 --> 4741.12
wow

4739.6 --> 4742.64
shadows are deliberately done

4741.12 --> 4745.12
incorrectly

4742.64 --> 4746.84
to let the researchers know it's cj did

4745.12 --> 4752.08
he actually say

4746.84 --> 4754.4800000000005
that or is that your inference

4752.08 --> 4754.48
tara

4760.84 --> 4769.04
306. wow holy [ __ ] he actually said that

4765.84 --> 4769.04
that is crazy

4770.08 --> 4773.08
wow

4782.8 --> 4787.28
yeah hell to the chef could you please

4784.56 --> 4790.4800000000005
stop being a whiny complainy pants or do

4787.28 --> 4792.239
you want to be a voice number two with

4790.48 --> 4795.239
this stream this is getting on my nerves

4792.239 --> 4795.239
man

4814.08 --> 4817.6
asking for hard evidence he just gave

4816.32 --> 4819.84
you a link

4817.6 --> 4821.76
healed to the chef

4819.84 --> 4824.719
i clicked the link

4821.76 --> 4824.719
he said it

4824.8 --> 4829.679
him saying it

4826.4 --> 4830.5599999999995
is evidence that's called an admission

4829.679 --> 4835.36
yeah

4830.56 --> 4838.2390000000005
the guy is a multi-billionaire

4835.36 --> 4841.599999999999
do you understand that that's not

4838.239 --> 4844.4
josh around the corner who makes

4841.6 --> 4847.120000000001
like 20 000 a year okay this is a

4844.4 --> 4848.5599999999995
multi-billion

4847.12 --> 4850.32
saying that

4848.56 --> 4853.92
you understand

4850.32 --> 4855.12
he can't afford to just make random

4853.92 --> 4859.28
jokes

4855.12 --> 4862.239
unless he's doing wizardry with it

4859.28 --> 4864.159
that's how it works

4862.239 --> 4868.0
multi-billionaires

4864.159 --> 4871.239
don't just make random stupid jokes

4868.0 --> 4871.239
like that

4879.44 --> 4884.4
maybe he was just telling you the truth

4881.52 --> 4887.679
in plain sight to be done with it

4884.4 --> 4889.839999999999
to just like yeah this okay this is fake

4887.679 --> 4891.4400000000005
but hey if you want to believe it i'm

4889.84 --> 4894.32
not gonna bother you with it all day

4891.44 --> 4895.28
just know that it's fake

4894.32 --> 4897.599999999999
right

4895.28 --> 4900.4
wizard

4897.6 --> 4900.400000000001
that's what it is

4900.8 --> 4906.400000000001
that's kind of his thing yeah wizardry

4902.96 --> 4906.4
is kind of his thing i know

4907.6 --> 4913.52
yeah now you may think oh that's just

4910.08 --> 4916.639
stupid jokes he's just being sarcastic

4913.52 --> 4919.360000000001
or he's just literally saying it right

4916.639 --> 4922.719
in plain sight as an admission

4919.36 --> 4926.5199999999995
under cover of you can think of it as a

4922.719 --> 4926.52
sarcastic joke

4941.92 --> 4946.08
okay to take a timeout if you're like

4944.56 --> 4948.4800000000005
that again tomorrow i'm going to kick

4946.08 --> 4948.48
you out

4952.0 --> 4959.84
hey chocolate's saying

4955.04 --> 4959.84
i haven't seen you in here in years

4972.719 --> 4977.199
yeah we were talking about elon musk and

4975.36 --> 4979.599999999999
apparently someone in the chat just

4977.199 --> 4981.839999999999
thinks oh he's just joking it's not an

4979.6 --> 4983.52
admission in plain sight

4981.84 --> 4984.8
that he's actually tricking you and

4983.52 --> 4988.080000000001
faking it

4984.8 --> 4991.84
no no he is just sarcastically joking

4988.08 --> 4993.679
that's not an admission he's using cgi

4991.84 --> 4995.1990000000005
even though he literally said oh yeah

4993.679 --> 4997.52
yeah we do that

4995.199 --> 5001.12
for the cgi

4997.52 --> 5002.8
because it makes it easier

5001.12 --> 5005.12
um

5002.8 --> 5006.96
no it's just a joke he's always making

5005.12 --> 5009.92
those jokes yeah that's called he's

5006.96 --> 5010.8
always doing admissions as a wizardry

5009.92 --> 5012.2390000000005
trick

5010.8 --> 5014.56
to basically

5012.239 --> 5016.638999999999
anybody that's really smart to inform

5014.56 --> 5019.4400000000005
them like hey just for the record this

5016.639 --> 5021.28
is a trick this is a magic trick

5019.44 --> 5023.839999999999
don't be fooled

5021.28 --> 5027.679
oh you want to be full okay by all means

5023.84 --> 5031.6
this is all real yeah that's what that

5027.679 --> 5033.52
is it's a mechanism they do it it's a

5031.6 --> 5035.1990000000005
mechanism

5033.52 --> 5037.76
so it in

5035.199 --> 5039.5199999999995
new zealand style

5037.76 --> 5043.4800000000005
mechanism

5039.52 --> 5043.4800000000005
but yeah that's what they do

5044.239 --> 5049.919999999999
yeah he's actually south african so

5047.679 --> 5052.96
why would he admit it

5049.92 --> 5055.4400000000005
because you have to

5052.96 --> 5057.36
you have to

5055.44 --> 5058.5599999999995
otherwise

5057.36 --> 5061.12
you become

5058.56 --> 5061.120000000001
liable

5062.4 --> 5066.638999999999
do you know that

5064.159 --> 5071.0
do you know that you have to actually do

5066.639 --> 5071.0
that or you become liable

5076.4 --> 5081.759999999999
right if he doesn't tell

5078.88 --> 5084.88
his investors everybody that's following

5081.76 --> 5087.4400000000005
hey oh yeah this is actually fake

5084.88 --> 5090.400000000001
it doesn't do that then some paying

5087.44 --> 5092.719
customer that invested a million or

5090.4 --> 5094.08
millions or however much

5092.719 --> 5095.76
can then go

5094.08 --> 5097.36
afterward like

5095.76 --> 5100.2390000000005
uh

5097.36 --> 5102.639
i was never told this is fake

5100.239 --> 5104.879999999999
i'm gonna sue you now i want my money

5102.639 --> 5107.04
back and i'm gonna get everybody else

5104.88 --> 5108.08
that paid here

5107.04 --> 5109.76
with me

5108.08 --> 5111.6
so they're all gonna ask their money

5109.76 --> 5113.6
back

5111.6 --> 5115.84
yeah well

5113.6 --> 5118.96
he can't do that

5115.84 --> 5121.28
if he was tall oh oh yeah it's actually

5118.96 --> 5121.28
fake

5121.6 --> 5125.04
yeah

5122.719 --> 5126.8
that's the point

5125.04 --> 5128.4
that's the

5126.8 --> 5131.04
point

5128.4 --> 5132.799999999999
of doing that

5131.04 --> 5135.44
you don't do that

5132.8 --> 5137.1990000000005
just because you think it's amusing and

5135.44 --> 5141.839999999999
it's your thing

5137.199 --> 5141.839999999999
no there's a reason to do that

5142.88 --> 5147.679
launch call off

5145.04 --> 5150.88
i called it

5147.679 --> 5154.52
i mean they cancel launches all the time

5150.88 --> 5154.52
it happens continually

5161.04 --> 5166.32
religion too

5162.639 --> 5171.12
yeah but it it's mostly legal it's legal

5166.32 --> 5171.12
you see they do it for a legal reason

5210.4 --> 5214.48
oh yeah yeah that's right yeah legi had

pretty

badass i think i may have already shared

5225.36 --> 5230.839999999999
that with the guys like when you made it

5227.679 --> 5230.84
at least

5250.08 --> 5253.08

the live stream on my live stream okay

5946.56 --> 5951.92
bunch of fantasies i mean

5948.96 --> 5953.84
there are people out there that are so

5951.92 --> 5956.0
so fantastical in their minds that

5953.84 --> 5957.1990000000005
they're just like oh somebody says

5956.0 --> 5959.92

5960.08 --> 5963.44
there are people like that that are just

5962.159 --> 5966.0
completely

5963.44 --> 5968.239
fantastical and fluid and everything can

5966.0 --> 5970.48
be true you just have to say it and it's

5968.239 --> 5970.48
true

5972.719 --> 5979.119
i added a little bit of that tendency

5975.52 --> 5979.119000000001
myself when i was much younger

5979.52 --> 5983.52
i would just get high on my own fantasy

that person just said it was real

5987.6 --> 5991.360000000001
i mean they could be lying they could

5988.96 --> 5993.679
have just made it up but what if i just

5991.36 --> 5995.839999999999
imagine that it was super serious and

5993.679 --> 5998.0
it's absolutely real

5995.84 --> 6001.119000000001
well then suddenly you got this in giant

5998.0 --> 6004.159
fantastical framework in your mind

6001.119 --> 6004.159
of how that's real

6004.4 --> 6010.239
and that's really you can hold on to

6006.239 --> 6010.239
that weird stuff for a very long time

6010.48 --> 6014.32
so i know about that

6012.56 --> 6018.2390000000005
there are people out there that do that

6014.32 --> 6020.4
and that do not have a lot of faculties

6018.239 --> 6024.0
so they are just like kind of floating

6020.4 --> 6025.599999999999
around like fishies in dreamland

6024.0 --> 6028.8
because everything is fluid everything

6025.6 --> 6032.639
is real whatever said it's real

6028.8 --> 6032.639
yeah i don't do that anymore though

6034.8 --> 6039.92
everybody wants to be a science fiction

6037.28 --> 6039.92
celebrity

6045.52 --> 6050.56
well to be fair

6047.36 --> 6054.639
i kind of want that too a little bit

6050.56 --> 6054.639
but not with this [ __ ] system

6055.119 --> 6059.119
i want to start from the ground up

6057.04 --> 6062.4
literally

6059.119 --> 6065.36
i just want the cosmogeny of how i

6062.4 --> 6068.0
figure things out with possibility of

6065.36 --> 6069.92
multiple realm segments and loop

6068.0 --> 6070.96
continuums and

6069.92 --> 6074.32
opening

6070.96 --> 6078.0
loops to other realm segments

6074.32 --> 6079.92
that's my science fiction realm

6078.0 --> 6080.88
and i would love to be the celebrity of

6079.92 --> 6083.119
that

6080.88 --> 6086.2390000000005
because i hope that it one day it will

6083.119 --> 6088.159
actually just go off and become popular

6086.239 --> 6092.119
and maybe even compete with the

6088.159 --> 6092.119
fictional space galaxy

6092.159 --> 6096.96
yeah that thing is completely [ __ ]

6094.4 --> 6099.839999999999
fake because the earth isn't a ball

6096.96 --> 6102.32
but the earth is flat and my

6099.84 --> 6104.84
science fiction cosmogeny

6102.32 --> 6106.5599999999995
conceptions are well flat earth

6104.84 --> 6109.56
compatible

6106.56 --> 6109.56
so

6123.04 --> 6125.76
inside there

6132.239 --> 6135.239
okay

6151.92 --> 6154.719
ridiculous

6159.52 --> 6164.400000000001
right

6160.8 --> 6164.400000000001
i'm gonna round out the show though

6165.119 --> 6169.36
it's been

6166.56 --> 6169.360000000001
pretty intense

6170.48 --> 6172.799999999999
uh

6174.0 --> 6177.84
talked about a whole bunch of things

6180.32 --> 6184.08
i should figure out a good title for

6182.0 --> 6186.4
this i mean yesterday's show was just

6184.08 --> 6188.159
completely untenable to figure out the

6186.4 --> 6191.839999999999
title for that

6188.159 --> 6191.839999999999
and even then i succeeded

6194.08 --> 6198.719
right

6195.84 --> 6201.28
human metadata

6198.719 --> 6203.199
and the human ai oh wait that by the way

6201.28 --> 6205.84
that was from two days ago i came up

6203.199 --> 6205.839999999999
with that

6206.44 --> 6212.719
1346 prove me wrong icarus that was the

6209.679 --> 6215.76
name then perfect name perfect

6212.719 --> 6218.4800000000005
i mean that episode is really important

6215.76 --> 6221.6
it's really important to me because that

6218.48 --> 6222.799999999999
is where i literally make a stand

6221.6 --> 6226.320000000001
for

6222.8 --> 6228.4800000000005
my conception within the realm

6226.32 --> 6232.36
prove me wrong icarus and i get really

6228.48 --> 6232.36
passionate about it too

6233.92 --> 6236.2390000000005
right

6237.52 --> 6241.280000000001
so yeah any suggestions would be cool

6239.84 --> 6243.84
for today's show

6241.28 --> 6246.48
make it actually serious just look at

6243.84 --> 6248.32
the titles of previous shows it has to

6246.48 --> 6250.879999999999
kind of fit with that so don't make it

6248.32 --> 6252.96
some hypey nonsense title that you know

6250.88 --> 6255.4400000000005
i would never take

6252.96 --> 6256.96
a real suggestion would be great

6255.44 --> 6258.719
if you if you

6256.96 --> 6261.52
think of it

6258.719 --> 6263.76
right but i am gonna round out now so

6261.52 --> 6265.679
thanks everyone for coming i hope you

6263.76 --> 6269.280000000001
liked this show i thought it was great

6265.679 --> 6271.119
despite yeah banning two people

6269.28 --> 6273.199
but it was just there was something

6271.119 --> 6276.48
gamma in the air and i had to deal with

6273.199 --> 6279.04
it can not tolerate that or everybody

6276.48 --> 6280.08
gets infected with it with the spirit of

6279.04 --> 6282.8
that

6280.08 --> 6284.639
right so anyway if you like this show
