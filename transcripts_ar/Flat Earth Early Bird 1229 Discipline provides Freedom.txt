[Music]

50.96 --> 55.64
good morning welcome to Flat Earth early

54.42 --> 59.039
bird number

55.64 --> 60.719
1229 I'm your host Arwin and before I

59.039 --> 63.120000000000005
start the show please don't forget to

60.719 --> 65.46000000000001
share it on any platform you deem fit

63.12 --> 67.14
and if you haven't already subscribe to

65.46 --> 70.02

72.0 --> 76.56
weekdays and 2 p.m Amsterdam time in the

74.1 --> 78.96
weekend please also do support me

76.56 --> 80.52
through the PayPal patreon Super Chat

78.96 --> 84.0
and the membership system join button

80.52 --> 86.39999999999999
that'll be much appreciated

84.0 --> 89.0
can always use it

86.4 --> 89.0
so

90.479 --> 95.64
hmm

91.979 --> 98.17999999999999
weather today is yeah clouded

95.64 --> 98.18
again

99.54 --> 103.28
it's pretty much the same as it was

101.04 --> 103.28
yesterday

111.0 --> 114.86
it's a little less windy

115.619 --> 118.439
but yeah

117.36 --> 121.02
just

118.439 --> 121.979
not so sunny today and neither was

121.02 --> 125.15899999999999
yesterday

121.979 --> 127.619
although it did clear up a little bit

125.159 --> 131.459
during the evening yesterday so maybe

127.619 --> 134.12
it'll do the same today we'll see

131.459 --> 134.12
right now

134.22 --> 138.8
excuse me

135.66 --> 138.79999999999998
fully clouded

139.92 --> 143.39999999999998
birds are seem to be very active out

142.68 --> 146.12
there

143.4 --> 146.12
right now

146.76 --> 150.01999999999998
hello jacked off

150.66 --> 153.26
what's up

155.76 --> 159.739
he knows he's being watched

166.8 --> 169.4
right

170.28 --> 172.94
huh

181.44 --> 190.22
hello pjc net first in chat brand M

185.12 --> 190.22
Terry 306 good to see you

190.62 --> 194.3
yes I'm starting a bit late

195.42 --> 201.17999999999998
but yeah it's Saturday and I don't know

199.08 --> 203.87900000000002
if I was gonna rush it

201.18 --> 206.78
I might just started being a bit cramped

203.879 --> 210.739
again I was yeah I

206.78 --> 210.739
am having a lot of energy

211.019 --> 215.64000000000001
uh-huh

213.72 --> 218.18
it's just a lot of inspiring things

215.64 --> 218.17999999999998
going on

219.48 --> 224.04
right but yeah when it's that much

221.94 --> 225.54
energy sometimes

224.04 --> 228.72
the

225.54 --> 229.85999999999999
I gotta get a bit off center

228.72 --> 233.04
uh

229.86 --> 236.519
anyway I'm here now

233.04 --> 239.959
like 45 minutes later so but

236.519 --> 239.959
I don't know I could just keep going

244.799 --> 247.28
right

247.439 --> 253.099
So Yesterday

249.26 --> 253.099
yesterday's show was pretty good

253.56 --> 260.78000000000003
I'm really getting it

255.54 --> 260.78
I like how I'm getting a better grip

263.759 --> 270.90000000000003
on like how to interact including like

267.0 --> 274.259
with situations that might

270.9 --> 278.65999999999997
pull my anger out

274.259 --> 278.66
so yeah just gonna keep going

279.36 --> 284.1
it's what you call a bank holiday

281.52 --> 287.29999999999995
weekend in the UK it's Monday it's

284.1 --> 287.3
public holiday oh okay

294.3 --> 298.62
there's a bank holiday during

300.9 --> 304.38
first Monday of May okay I didn't know

303.0 --> 307.16
that I didn't know that was a

304.38 --> 307.15999999999997
reoccurring thing

310.259 --> 315.06
there used to be like a queen's day here

313.38 --> 316.259
in the Netherlands but then they moved

315.06 --> 319.5
it

316.259 --> 321.96000000000004
and turns into turned into King's Day

319.5 --> 324.12
after yeah

321.96 --> 326.71999999999997
we got a King instead of a queen here in

324.12 --> 326.72
the Netherlands

328.259 --> 333.18
but they also yeah moved to date so but

331.139 --> 334.32
yeah I don't know it's not much really

333.18 --> 337.5
happening

334.32 --> 340.68
right now during these days here

337.5 --> 343.68
they used to be like markets like more

340.68 --> 345.90000000000003
like a big Market everywhere and like a

343.68 --> 349.259
black market like

345.9 --> 351.78
everybody basically becomes tax exempt

349.259 --> 355.199
and yeah typically Dutch people then

351.78 --> 358.25899999999996
just like get their stuff out their old

355.199 --> 360.6
stuff put it on a blanket sit there

358.259 --> 364.16
on the street that's what that's queen

360.6 --> 364.16
that used to be Queen's Day

365.06 --> 372.62
I think that's still sort of going on

367.86 --> 372.62
with King's day or but yeah I'm not sure

372.96 --> 377.15999999999997
I'm not very participating in that sort

375.3 --> 379.44
of thing I mean it's kind of fun if you

377.16 --> 381.62
have somebody to like walk the markets

379.44 --> 381.62
with

381.96 --> 389.35999999999996
but yeah I don't

385.979 --> 389.35999999999996
hello Mike zedunich

396.0 --> 399.419
Neil deGrasse Tyson lies did I say hello

398.58 --> 401.46
yet

399.419 --> 404.64
anyway I've said it now

401.46 --> 404.64
[Music]

405.24 --> 408.90000000000003
uh

406.62 --> 410.699
right so yeah yesterday's flatters

408.9 --> 412.56
debate

410.699 --> 417.3
was pretty

412.56 --> 420.72
good and intense the after show was also

417.3 --> 421.979
it was more a continuation of what was

420.72 --> 424.819
happening

421.979 --> 424.81899999999996
day before

425.28 --> 433.73999999999995
the more uh yeah ethereans trying to

430.5 --> 436.08
prove ether is real and just not letting

433.74 --> 439.62
it go

436.08 --> 441.78
but yeah it's that's a debate to have

439.62 --> 443.099
and I thought Nathan was doing really

441.78 --> 445.61999999999995
well with it

443.099 --> 446.759
against the yeah these guys that were

445.62 --> 449.46
just

446.759 --> 452.639
doubling down

449.46 --> 454.38
on just multiple it was like space-time

452.639 --> 455.88
bending right

454.38 --> 458.699
ether

455.88 --> 461.4
is like space-time bending

458.699 --> 464.879
so people have learned oh this is how

461.4 --> 467.69899999999996
you describe gravity right oh look at

464.879 --> 470.34000000000003
bowling ball on a

467.699 --> 472.62
on a piece of cloth and oh elastic and

470.34 --> 475.5
oh yeah that's right so there's all

472.62 --> 478.319
these descriptions of space-time bending

475.5 --> 480.72
but nobody knows what it actually is

478.319 --> 483.84000000000003
it's all just metaphorical descriptions

480.72 --> 486.78000000000003
it doesn't ever pin down

483.84 --> 489.539
like what is the substance of it really

486.78 --> 493.13899999999995
it's only descriptions and it seems like

489.539 --> 494.46
ether light-based ether

493.139 --> 497.34000000000003
is

494.46 --> 499.919
having the same problem everybody's just

497.34 --> 501.9
describing how it should be there and

499.919 --> 505.19899999999996
like

501.9 --> 506.94
can't really pinpoint down right

505.199 --> 509.759
and really they can't really pin it down

506.94 --> 513.319
it always comes down to basically its

509.759 --> 513.319
light it's just light that's it

513.539 --> 520.26
has to be there supposedly

516.959 --> 523.68
so yeah that's going on

520.26 --> 526.019
we'll see if that continues like yeah in

523.68 --> 528.5
the next week

526.019 --> 528.5
Monday

528.72 --> 533.399
but yeah there's a lot of people that

531.0 --> 535.86
are stuck to this well kind of

533.399 --> 537.0
aberration right it's an aberration like

535.86 --> 539.88
gravity

537.0 --> 542.22
especially the the space-time bending

539.88 --> 544.56
part of that and how people

542.22 --> 547.08
deal with that it's very similar to that

544.56 --> 550.0189999999999
so yeah

547.08 --> 552.6600000000001
either light ether

550.019 --> 554.76
is an aberration

552.66 --> 558.4399999999999
and there's a lot of flat earthers that

554.76 --> 558.4399999999999
are falling into that trap

558.899 --> 563.3
little borders boy Matthew Hall

584.04 --> 588.0799999999999
oh right there was that

590.459 --> 594.68
I'm only certain there was some Jim Bob

597.42 --> 602.0999999999999
right

600.0 --> 605.66
he was talking about all kinds of weird

602.1 --> 605.66
things with guests

608.279 --> 611.88
if only it wasn't for the time slot

610.74 --> 615.3
because

611.88 --> 617.3389999999999
like I'd love to be on the energy level

615.3 --> 620.04
that I'm at now

617.339 --> 622.2
and like get on a show right get on Jim

620.04 --> 625.079
Bob and have a talk with him but he does

622.2 --> 626.22
it in a time slot where I I'm not like

625.079 --> 629.0999999999999
that

626.22 --> 632.22
I mean I'm like that on the surface

629.1 --> 634.9200000000001
right I can still be super active in

632.22 --> 636.12
chat even more so than I would at a time

634.92 --> 639.42
like this

636.12 --> 640.86
but to actually like on camera interact

639.42 --> 643.26
and communicate

640.86 --> 644.519
that's very tough for me during that

643.26 --> 648.3
time

644.519 --> 649.98
which to me is like between

648.3 --> 653.4799999999999
nine

649.98 --> 653.48
and 12 P.M

659.22 --> 666.12
so we'll see what happens

661.98 --> 667.9200000000001
maybe one day I will get on there or

666.12 --> 672.0
we'll see

667.92 --> 673.5
John Hawkins video of me yeah this is

672.0 --> 676.019
yeah that happened

673.5 --> 679.04
Sean Hawkins is I don't know man he's

676.019 --> 679.04
like this weird

680.339 --> 684.48
I really get the feeling like he wants

682.68 --> 687.4399999999999
to be a student of mine but he just

684.48 --> 687.44
doesn't get anything

689.82 --> 694.339
I'm really kind of sorry for him at this

692.16 --> 694.3389999999999
point

697.32 --> 699.5600000000001
okay

705.48 --> 709.2
don't know why YouTube would recommend

707.64 --> 712.6999999999999
me that video

709.2 --> 712.7
I don't know either man

717.839 --> 723.9590000000001
but I but yeah

721.68 --> 726.959
Maybe

723.959 --> 729.959
Sean Hawkins through how he is is like

726.959 --> 731.88
an unwitting Advertiser for me and I

729.959 --> 734.459
don't even know about it it's just like

731.88 --> 735.8389999999999
how the system arranges for people to

734.459 --> 738.4799999999999
connect up

735.839 --> 741.0
Sean Hawkins gets in the view of

738.48 --> 743.279
everybody is a complete idiot

741.0 --> 745.8
but he gets in the view of everybody he

743.279 --> 749.04
plays my videos

745.8 --> 751.019
well that way people might get to see

749.04 --> 753.06
Snippets of my videos that aren't

751.019 --> 754.98
actually terrible Sean Hawkins just

753.06 --> 757.5
seems to think they are for some reason

754.98 --> 759.8000000000001
that eludes a lot of people including

757.5 --> 759.8
myself

761.76 --> 768.74
and then people get to see that piece of

764.7 --> 768.74
me and be like hey who is that guy

770.94 --> 773.899
right so

774.06 --> 780.06
maybe this is like the algorithm's

776.579 --> 783.5999999999999
sneaky way to kind of spread my word

780.06 --> 786.959
without letting the controllers know the

783.6 --> 790.0790000000001
interfaces because not just I'm

786.959 --> 792.68
attributing secret intelligence and

790.079 --> 792.68
agenda

795.839 --> 802.44
it's just that it the the natural are

800.399 --> 806.18
seemingly natural chemistry of what's

802.44 --> 806.1800000000001
going on can be so weird at times

806.279 --> 812.279
because what Sean Hawkins puts out of me

808.86 --> 814.76
is it's just never really a detriment to

812.279 --> 814.76
what I do

816.18 --> 823.38
like from many perspectives right that's

819.42 --> 825.42
what I try to achieve fractal input like

823.38 --> 828.0
no matter what I do

825.42 --> 830.399
I expect people of all kinds of levels

828.0 --> 832.56
of understanding and being informed like

830.399 --> 836.1
they could just be new they could be a

832.56 --> 838.7399999999999
long time follower I'm trying to act in

836.1 --> 842.639
a way that accounts for all of that so

838.74 --> 845.72
to me virtually it's like when I talk

842.639 --> 848.76
I see all those

845.72 --> 851.22
designations as personifications like

848.76 --> 853.3199999999999
they were in the room with me like the

851.22 --> 854.94
the person whoever that might be I don't

853.32 --> 856.8000000000001
even necessarily have to know they are

854.94 --> 859.44
that's been following me for a long time

856.8 --> 861.779
and that gets me on a deeper level the

859.44 --> 864.0600000000001
person that's been following me for a

861.779 --> 866.16
long time but doesn't really get it the

864.06 --> 868.0189999999999
person is being following me for a very

866.16 --> 870.18
short time that's like really into me

868.019 --> 872.579
and got a feel for me they don't

870.18 --> 874.3199999999999
necessarily completely get me yet the

872.579 --> 877.26
person that got into the room just now

874.32 --> 878.6990000000001
and is like completely off

877.26 --> 881.9399999999999
like how

878.699 --> 885.9799999999999
all of these effects are that right

881.94 --> 885.98
there to me as I do everything

886.68 --> 891.2399999999999
consciously

888.72 --> 893.339
and that's part of how I

891.24 --> 898.639
keep myself

893.339 --> 898.639
on track with fractal thinking

901.44 --> 908.0400000000001
right anyway thank you and cool Ben

904.82 --> 911.1
we're the 10 pound Super Chat donation

908.04 --> 915.899
that's appreciated welcome

911.1 --> 918.9590000000001
I see you hang around the FED a lot

915.899 --> 921.42
so you must have got up pretty early or

918.959 --> 923.399
you're still up very late

921.42 --> 925.199
I take it

923.399 --> 928.5
I don't know I don't know where you're

925.199 --> 931.3199999999999
from actually might be England

928.5 --> 934.22
anyway welcome

931.32 --> 934.22
hello JD

944.36 --> 949.8000000000001
why don't I permanently remove these

947.22 --> 953.4590000000001
Tarts well turret 306

949.8 --> 955.9799999999999
it's because of the rules

953.459 --> 957.8389999999999
like the rules that I've set

955.98 --> 960.6
for this show right

957.839 --> 962.639
yes on an Impulse I'd like to just ban

960.6 --> 966.139
these guys but

962.639 --> 966.139
I have to recognize

966.48 --> 970.44
that

967.92 --> 972.3
if they have some good qualities in

970.44 --> 974.94
between it all

972.3 --> 978.62
that like I have to like give them a

974.94 --> 978.62
break up to a certain level right

979.62 --> 985.279
so if somebody is gonna come in and is

982.68 --> 988.1389999999999
just acting like a deviant or

985.279 --> 990.24
belligerent and they're not showing

988.139 --> 993.3
signs that they're actually even being

990.24 --> 995.279
creative at it then I will ban them

993.3 --> 996.779
because then they're not productive and

995.279 --> 999.959
they're probably not even productive to

996.779 --> 1001.759
themselves they're just squirty just

999.959 --> 1005.06
wasting the energy

1001.759 --> 1007.519
not learning from it but

1005.06 --> 1010.04
if they have like qualities and they

1007.519 --> 1011.72
don't like politically abuse them for

1010.04 --> 1014.7199999999999
their own ego

1011.72 --> 1016.72
right like they're they're reasonable or

1014.72 --> 1020.5400000000001
they have a great Insight on people

1016.72 --> 1022.1
naturally then I want those people to

1020.54 --> 1024.079
stay around

1022.1 --> 1027.679
because everybody makes mistakes

1024.079 --> 1030.1399999999999
including like being on the wrong side

1027.679 --> 1030.919
of an argument and wanting to hold on to

1030.14 --> 1034.22
that

1030.919 --> 1036.439
I was that I was that baller that

1034.22 --> 1038.299
Ballwin

1036.439 --> 1041.9
I was that

1038.299 --> 1045.199
I just as Baldwin was very restrained

1041.9 --> 1047.48
like back then I heard of flatter this a

1045.199 --> 1049.94
couple of times

1047.48 --> 1051.44
it's weird because in a way they kind of

1049.94 --> 1054.559
scared me

1051.44 --> 1056.179
not because of arguments because of how

1054.559 --> 1058.16
much friction there would have been

1056.179 --> 1061.16
their pressure social pressure something

1058.16 --> 1063.3200000000002
I was not very fond of

1061.16 --> 1066.919
when I was younger at all

1063.32 --> 1071.32
was more sensitive than I was even now

1066.919 --> 1071.3200000000002
so I avoided that

1072.5 --> 1079.82
right becoming a flat earther on YouTube

1076.34 --> 1080.8999999999999
was really kind of like Crossing that

1079.82 --> 1083.539
bridge

1080.9 --> 1086.0590000000002
that I've avoided for a long time

1083.539 --> 1088.46
like even as a baller because I would

1086.059 --> 1090.08
never like go out and like oh this

1088.46 --> 1091.22
stupid flat earthers because that would

1090.08 --> 1093.3799999999999
make me

1091.22 --> 1095.539
like even a thought about that when I

1093.38 --> 1098.0
was still a baller even a thought about

1095.539 --> 1101.0
that would make me it was like this

1098.0 --> 1103.22
weird mysterious dread in the background

1101.0 --> 1105.08
like there's something going on here

1103.22 --> 1106.64
that you don't understand but you're

1105.08 --> 1110.32
gonna feel it

1106.64 --> 1110.3200000000002
so I would never do that

1111.44 --> 1116.179
and eventually that led to a weird kind

1114.44 --> 1118.52
of meta View

1116.179 --> 1119.9
that was disconnected from My overall

1118.52 --> 1123.1399999999999
being

1119.9 --> 1125.9
where I'd be like I think you flat

1123.14 --> 1128.179
earthers are actually right you're just

1125.9 --> 1130.16
not in control

1128.179 --> 1133.66
of like

1130.16 --> 1137.3600000000001
the oversight you don't have a proper

1133.66 --> 1140.299
mechanism Foundation to build it up a

1137.36 --> 1142.76
lot of Flat Earth is done right I I'm

1140.299 --> 1144.5
very lucky to know a few now that do do

1142.76 --> 1147.5
that

1144.5 --> 1149.48
but yeah way back nothing right the Flat

1147.5 --> 1151.88
Earth is that I do knew that were kind

1149.48 --> 1156.02
of coming out they were hippies most of

1151.88 --> 1158.6000000000001
them they didn't really very woozy they

1156.02 --> 1163.0
wouldn't like be have discipline to

1158.6 --> 1163.0
provide like tangible proof and things

1164.9 --> 1169.22
right

1166.94 --> 1171.74
but I it was like

1169.22 --> 1173.96
they would tell me things and it would

1171.74 --> 1177.38
like really on a fractal level already

1173.96 --> 1180.2
sink into me when I wasn't yet ready to

1177.38 --> 1183.44
bur to carry that burden psychologically

1180.2 --> 1186.38
right so I would like lift out of my

1183.44 --> 1188.9
person spiritually get in like this

1186.38 --> 1190.7
higher position that's very unpersonal

1188.9 --> 1192.5590000000002
and just realize

1190.7 --> 1196.64
you're right

1192.559 --> 1199.3999999999999
but I cannot accept this right now

1196.64 --> 1201.5
I will not Grill you over that but I

1199.4 --> 1205.419
think you're right you just can't

1201.5 --> 1205.419
properly explain why

1206.72 --> 1212.96
like I I had those types of moments

1210.799 --> 1215.299
a lot

1212.96 --> 1217.88
overall and would always be like very

1215.299 --> 1221.62
mystified by that afterward like whoa

1217.88 --> 1221.6200000000001
what was that is that really me

1223.22 --> 1230.059
that I could just step outside of my own

1227.2 --> 1230.8400000000001
personal world view and just kind of

1230.059 --> 1233.48
like

1230.84 --> 1237.6999999999998
recognize

1233.48 --> 1237.7
the implications of raw data

1238.159 --> 1242.5
so it's very fascinating

1240.08 --> 1242.5
right

1243.26 --> 1249.8799999999999
and that was way back now I'm like

1246.74 --> 1249.88
it's all connected

1250.82 --> 1255.2
it's no longer even that mysterious I

1253.159 --> 1257.72
can't basically describe in detail now

1255.2 --> 1260.539
what is happening

1257.72 --> 1262.82
when I did that and when I do it because

1260.539 --> 1266.179
I still do that right now I do it like

1262.82 --> 1269.2
cons it's like a a trait it's a thing I

1266.179 --> 1269.2
have that I can do

1273.679 --> 1278.659
sometimes right it's not a on command

1276.5 --> 1281.86
thing the energy has to be there then I

1278.659 --> 1281.8600000000001
have the option to do it

1284.299 --> 1286.78
anyway

1292.52 --> 1297.32
um people crying about me Banning their

1294.98 --> 1299.659
soccer guns

1297.32 --> 1304.24
yeah including

1299.659 --> 1304.24
sock account called soccercon yeah yeah

1308.24 --> 1311.14
it's just

1311.84 --> 1316.76
like what I know it's really funny

1314.48 --> 1319.94
especially to you guys right

1316.76 --> 1322.1589999999999
I'm just like puzzled by it like

1319.94 --> 1324.02
what are outside people gonna think

1322.159 --> 1326.179
about that and that's so weird right

1324.02 --> 1329.539
there's guys

1326.179 --> 1332.0590000000002
like he's always Banning myself and then

1329.539 --> 1334.46
like you can even see that like they're

1332.059 --> 1338.26
called soccer gown

1334.46 --> 1338.26
so it's like what is that

1339.08 --> 1344.059
like what will people think about that

1341.84 --> 1346.58
situation will they just think like holy

1344.059 --> 1349.22
[ __ ] like these people that are stalking

1346.58 --> 1351.6789999999999
this guy are really insane

1349.22 --> 1354.38
or will they get actually flustered as

1351.679 --> 1355.7
to like there's something really weird

1354.38 --> 1358.88
going on

1355.7 --> 1361.46
and get all paranoid perhaps maybe think

1358.88 --> 1363.98
that I am in control of these guys do

1361.46 --> 1366.52
like making them do that or something

1363.98 --> 1366.52
right

1366.919 --> 1371.659
and yeah

1368.659 --> 1374.0
I do have moments where I basically get

1371.659 --> 1376.159
like okay you think you can take me well

1374.0 --> 1378.919
just do it then right make your videos

1376.159 --> 1380.8400000000001
like yeah oh you think you can correct

1378.919 --> 1383.96
the r win codes

1380.84 --> 1387.26
make your little videos then

1383.96 --> 1389.48
see if you're actually doing it I mean

1387.26 --> 1391.52
just taking a snippet

1389.48 --> 1395.48
off something I said at some point

1391.52 --> 1398.36
doesn't make a point by itself

1395.48 --> 1403.179
except for the point that I'm making

1398.36 --> 1403.1789999999999
that well you might misunderstand

1408.02 --> 1414.86
what do I mean by fractal thinking you

1411.38 --> 1417.88
heard me heard the phrase whoa okay

1414.86 --> 1417.8799999999999
now you ask

1419.419 --> 1422.2
that took some time

1425.299 --> 1430.94
all right yeah I'll explain it to you

1427.82 --> 1433.9399999999998
well fractal thinking

1430.94 --> 1433.94
foreign

1438.74 --> 1446.179
where you try to get realistic about

1442.279 --> 1450.02
what the consequences are

1446.179 --> 1453.38
of what you're saying like how will that

1450.02 --> 1455.84
inspire people and with people it's not

1453.38 --> 1457.8200000000002
just the people that you want to even

1455.84 --> 1460.279
like get close to you necessarily right

1457.82 --> 1462.02
the people that you want to attract

1460.279 --> 1463.76
because that's going to be naturally

1462.02 --> 1465.559
where your focus is going to be for a

1463.76 --> 1467.6
lot of people that's natural to have

1465.559 --> 1470.299
that focus on them like the ones you

1467.6 --> 1472.34
want right

1470.299 --> 1475.1589999999999
fractal thinking

1472.34 --> 1478.24
side steps that

1475.159 --> 1478.24
and aims

1478.279 --> 1484.94
to basically as you're speaking get a

1481.7 --> 1488.72
live oversight over like everything that

1484.94 --> 1491.419
could potentially come from it like just

1488.72 --> 1493.039
imagine all the ways the information is

1491.419 --> 1495.5590000000002
going to come across

1493.039 --> 1499.8799999999999
right later on

1495.559 --> 1501.1399999999999
put into a weird context

1499.88 --> 1507.0200000000002
or

1501.14 --> 1510.8600000000001
what if it's like a first pulse

1507.02 --> 1514.1589999999999
of a like a a natural impulse that's

1510.86 --> 1515.779
going around that's keeping repeating

1514.159 --> 1518.5390000000002
itself and then

1515.779 --> 1521.6
I might be very early about it I might

1518.539 --> 1523.64
literally be on up digging up a seed

1521.6 --> 1527.779
that's going to be a thing in the future

1523.64 --> 1531.679
right so all these potentials to have

1527.779 --> 1534.86
them all in mind

1531.679 --> 1536.24
as you basically speak

1534.86 --> 1539.4799999999998
so that

1536.24 --> 1542.059
you well in a way avoid

1539.48 --> 1545.24
being contemporary

1542.059 --> 1547.82
like hyper specific about something in a

1545.24 --> 1550.34
moment or an object right

1547.82 --> 1551.8999999999999
within like temporary how are you

1550.34 --> 1553.6999999999998
thinking right now what do you care

1551.9 --> 1558.6200000000001
about now priorities

1553.7 --> 1561.8600000000001
and instead try to deliver

1558.62 --> 1564.799
thinking and reasoning that will stand

1561.86 --> 1567.9799999999998
the test of time and that will apply to

1564.799 --> 1569.539
more than just what you contemporarily

1567.98 --> 1570.74
like

1569.539 --> 1575.679
right

1570.74 --> 1575.679
that all is involved in fractal thinking

1576.02 --> 1581.539
it's really about having an oversight

1578.72 --> 1584.059
about how all things work naturally and

1581.539 --> 1586.8799999999999
yeah you can't literally have like the

1584.059 --> 1590.0
complete reasoning patterns of people in

1586.88 --> 1592.5800000000002
their minds and like yeah billions of

1590.0 --> 1594.679
them like you can't have that there's no

1592.58 --> 1597.86
room for that it's like a billion voices

1594.679 --> 1600.44
A Billion Lives and Impressions and [ __ ]

1597.86 --> 1603.1399999999999
that's not reasonable

1600.44 --> 1606.919
but if you understand the patterns

1603.14 --> 1609.6200000000001
within it then you can reduce it to a

1606.919 --> 1613.1200000000001
simplified skeletal structure of it

1609.62 --> 1617.059
and then suddenly everything can compact

1613.12 --> 1619.3999999999999
in into a spectrum

1617.059 --> 1622.46
so highly

1619.4 --> 1624.679
esoteric what I'm talking about like

1622.46 --> 1627.559
visualization mechanics and how your

1624.679 --> 1630.26
instinct eventually deals with that I've

1627.559 --> 1633.74
analyzed it to no end and I describe it

1630.26 --> 1635.419
I'm describing it right now so that

1633.74 --> 1639.02
fractal thinking

1635.419 --> 1641.419
and fractal speaking especially

1639.02 --> 1644.059
fractal thinking is the part where you

1641.419 --> 1645.919
realize how things will connect how

1644.059 --> 1649.8799999999999
people develop how people change their

1645.919 --> 1652.88
minds how moods change how people see

1649.88 --> 1656.0
how being preoccupied or obsessed about

1652.88 --> 1658.7600000000002
something changes the way they see and

1656.0 --> 1662.32
then cross reflect what you're gonna say

1658.76 --> 1662.32
having all that in mind

1662.539 --> 1670.1589999999999
to like see all these types of listeners

1666.2 --> 1671.419
throughout time listening to you live in

1670.159 --> 1674.6000000000001
that moment

1671.419 --> 1677.179
except they might see it or experience

1674.6 --> 1678.98
that actual moment and the result of it

1677.179 --> 1682.419
within their own time frame because

1678.98 --> 1682.419
they're watching afterward

1684.32 --> 1689.4189999999999
yeah

1685.76 --> 1692.0
that's fractal thinking and with fractal

1689.419 --> 1696.5200000000002
speaking as a result will it always

1692.0 --> 1696.52
apply there will be more

1696.74 --> 1700.96
meta

1698.299 --> 1704.059
things in it too right because

1700.96 --> 1705.919
fractal thinking you're you want to

1704.059 --> 1707.899
describe structures that will apply

1705.919 --> 1710.2990000000002
always so you're gonna get meta because

1707.899 --> 1713.6589999999999
as soon as you get hyperspecific

1710.299 --> 1715.8799999999999
so to name names or name objects

1713.659 --> 1719.2990000000002
specifically

1715.88 --> 1720.8600000000001
then that distracts away that like pins

1719.299 --> 1723.5
it down

1720.86 --> 1726.02
makes it contemporary because then

1723.5 --> 1730.72
everything's gonna rest on those

1726.02 --> 1730.72
contemporary elements about it yeah

1731.36 --> 1736.039
so I can describe

1733.7 --> 1738.799
something that I've experienced

1736.039 --> 1742.48
and then tell it in a way

1738.799 --> 1745.279
where it's very easy for others watching

1742.48 --> 1746.84
to compare it to something that they

1745.279 --> 1750.559
might have experienced right there right

1746.84 --> 1753.1999999999998
then or just a bit ago or it might

1750.559 --> 1755.4189999999999
happen the day after and it's like yeah

1753.2 --> 1756.38
you can like whoa this is exactly like

1755.419 --> 1758.0
that

1756.38 --> 1760.3990000000001
right

1758.0 --> 1763.34
all I have to do is not get hyper

1760.399 --> 1765.86
specific not make the description like

1763.34 --> 1767.299
all about me and my experience in the

1765.86 --> 1769.039
moment

1767.299 --> 1772.94
but instead

1769.039 --> 1776.059
see the useful processes that could

1772.94 --> 1779.1200000000001
naturally come out of a situation like

1776.059 --> 1781.279
that and then just describe a situation

1779.12 --> 1785.12
like that

1781.279 --> 1789.08
based on the actual experience and that

1785.12 --> 1791.779
way people can like cross reflect on it

1789.08 --> 1794.36
a lot more and like immediately compare

1791.779 --> 1796.76
it without much distraction with the

1794.36 --> 1798.6789999999999
situation in their life

1796.76 --> 1800.899
I hope

1798.679 --> 1805.419
that explains

1800.899 --> 1805.4189999999999
fractal thinking to you borders why

1805.46 --> 1809.14
I know it's quite intense

1812.46 --> 1815.609
[Music]

1817.279 --> 1821.299
I thought your fractal thinking was

1819.2 --> 1822.8600000000001
thinking that looks chaotic but is in

1821.299 --> 1825.98
fact structured well

1822.86 --> 1830.1789999999999
that's from a Consciousness perspective

1825.98 --> 1833.3600000000001
JD correct right but that's the general

1830.179 --> 1836.72
nature of understanding in itself

1833.36 --> 1840.62
right chaos

1836.72 --> 1843.799
is order that you do not have the

1840.62 --> 1846.559
stamina to grasp in that moment

1843.799 --> 1849.02
but over time you might look back on it

1846.559 --> 1852.799
and then suddenly it does turn out to

1849.02 --> 1855.559
have structure it isn't actually chaotic

1852.799 --> 1858.9189999999999
right well that is a piece of wisdom

1855.559 --> 1861.82
that is included in the discipline of

1858.919 --> 1861.8200000000002
fractal thinking

1864.86 --> 1869.36
like if you hear something it doesn't

1866.779 --> 1872.38
make sense to you with how you think in

1869.36 --> 1876.34
that moment don't just discard it

1872.38 --> 1880.94
realize you might not be

1876.34 --> 1883.34
resonating enough yet if you may choose

1880.94 --> 1886.8990000000001
to or you may not choose not to

1883.34 --> 1886.899
to fully understand it

1890.11 --> 1893.1799999999998
[Music]

1895.34 --> 1899.48
rectal knowing

1897.32 --> 1901.9399999999998
well knowing is fractal

1899.48 --> 1903.559
it's not but knowing is not like a

1901.94 --> 1906.559
discipline knowing is just knowing

1903.559 --> 1908.539
thinking is what you do with it is what

1906.559 --> 1910.039
you do with your attention

1908.539 --> 1912.26
in your mind

1910.039 --> 1914.899
that's disciplines that's something you

1912.26 --> 1916.76
can actually do and train knowing is

1914.899 --> 1920.4799999999998
knowing

1916.76 --> 1923.36
knowing is just like carrying away

1920.48 --> 1926.24
it's you either take it and then you

1923.36 --> 1929.1399999999999
deal with it or you don't take it

1926.24 --> 1929.14
you hold it off

1932.72 --> 1935.32
yes

1941.31 --> 1945.71
[Music]

1945.919 --> 1950.3200000000002
ah

1947.779 --> 1950.32
right

1953.779 --> 1958.779
so reporter's boy did can I have some

1956.419 --> 1958.779
feedback

1962.779 --> 1970.36
fractal is knowledge

1966.2 --> 1970.3600000000001
not no not necessarily

1970.399 --> 1975.399
knowledge is fractal but fractal is a

1972.98 --> 1979.58
knowledge we see a fractal is a pattern

1975.399 --> 1981.1399999999999
knowledge is a field

1979.58 --> 1982.76
knowledge

1981.14 --> 1985.22
is

1982.76 --> 1988.8799999999999
fractal in the sense that there's always

1985.22 --> 1990.679
more and it is it's built like a pattern

1988.88 --> 1992.72
like a fractal

1990.679 --> 1995.48
right now if you know like with the

1992.72 --> 1997.519
Mendel brought like there's always more

1995.48 --> 2001.679
it's going to be built on the previous

1997.519 --> 2001.679
pattern that part that you can see

2004.539 --> 2009.7
then you have some insight on the nature

2008.08 --> 2012.1589999999999
of knowledge

2009.7 --> 2014.38
it is fractal but it doesn't mean that

2012.159 --> 2015.5800000000002
fractal

2014.38 --> 2019.919
like

2015.58 --> 2019.9189999999999
the word fractal is knowledge no

2029.5 --> 2035.62
mindfulness it is yes borders why it is

2032.62 --> 2035.62
mindfulness

2036.159 --> 2038.88
doesn't

2039.22 --> 2043.659
it's more superficial in a way

2040.899 --> 2046.5
mindfulness is about attention and

2043.659 --> 2050.56
consequences though so yeah mindfulness

2046.5 --> 2052.839
is like adjacent to fractal thinking but

2050.56 --> 2056.679
fractal thinking

2052.839 --> 2059.639
is less focused even on

2056.679 --> 2061.2000000000003
social interactions

2059.639 --> 2064.7200000000003
contemporary

2061.2 --> 2066.399
complications like managing social

2064.72 --> 2068.3199999999997
interactions which is what mindfulness

2066.399 --> 2071.2
really is about and personal

2068.32 --> 2073.4190000000003
introspection of course

2071.2 --> 2076.1189999999997
practical thinking is more about the

2073.419 --> 2079.839
substance of knowledge development

2076.119 --> 2082.599
and how people learn throughout their

2079.839 --> 2085.7799999999997
life how that actually works and builds

2082.599 --> 2090.0
so it's more focused not on the social

2085.78 --> 2090.0
interactions but on the Mind itself

2092.619 --> 2095.8790000000004
at least it is for me

2100.92 --> 2108.1800000000003
paramatra paramatma I don't know that

2103.96 --> 2108.18
word what does that mean there are 306

2113.619 --> 2118.0
right but it's funny because what is why

2116.079 --> 2121.78
that you mentioned mindfulness

2118.0 --> 2124.78
I I say that when I'm going to basically

2121.78 --> 2127.3590000000004
like let for example the last time I

2124.78 --> 2130.2400000000002
went to the doctor and I basically I was

2127.359 --> 2132.94
new there I laid it down like yeah I'm

2130.24 --> 2136.7799999999997
very spiritual and sensitive

2132.94 --> 2139.119
and I'm like trained in mindfulness I

2136.78 --> 2142.6600000000003
use that because I know

2139.119 --> 2144.76
mindfulness is a very widely taught

2142.66 --> 2147.7599999999998
thing now here especially in the

2144.76 --> 2151.2400000000002
Netherlands like people

2147.76 --> 2154.3590000000004
a lot of people have learned that

2151.24 --> 2156.5789999999997
so it's an easy reference for me even

2154.359 --> 2158.2
though I haven't literally done it I

2156.579 --> 2160.96
know what it's about

2158.2 --> 2164.0789999999997
I know what it does and I am doing it

2160.96 --> 2167.579
myself I've done it before I noticed

2164.079 --> 2167.579
that mindfulness was out there

2167.619 --> 2172.48
but it's been kind of like encouraging

2169.839 --> 2175.7799999999997
because it's like oh that's good I can

2172.48 --> 2178.359
really use people out there and have

2175.78 --> 2181.7400000000002
mindfulness trading because they will be

2178.359 --> 2181.74
able to deal with me better

2183.52 --> 2186.3
ah

2189.64 --> 2192.1189999999997
right

2193.06 --> 2196.02
Google it

2197.32 --> 2201.339
mindfulness was such a gift

2200.2 --> 2203.9399999999996
um

2201.339 --> 2203.94
yeah

2204.099 --> 2209.5
I mean but mindful it's not

2207.22 --> 2211.24
it's not perfect though there there are

2209.5 --> 2213.46
still

2211.24 --> 2216.7
like it's basically a set of disciplines

2213.46 --> 2219.46
derived from all kinds of things

2216.7 --> 2223.14
but there's there's like still people

2219.46 --> 2223.14
that can technically abuse it

2223.66 --> 2228.46
like luciferians know all about

2226.78 --> 2232.619
mindfulness

2228.46 --> 2232.619
they do because it's so effective

2240.64 --> 2243.1189999999997
right

2243.4 --> 2248.56
but yeah

2245.14 --> 2253.0
it is like really a great a great

2248.56 --> 2255.099
opportunity for people to basically get

2253.0 --> 2257.56
a grip

2255.099 --> 2259.839
at least on social interactions and

2257.56 --> 2261.5789999999997
that's good because we need that in a

2259.839 --> 2263.56
world of chaos

2261.579 --> 2266.7400000000002
where we're constantly getting bombarded

2263.56 --> 2269.98
by hysteria and the arrangement the

2266.74 --> 2272.56
range for thinking mindfulness is a good

2269.98 --> 2275.859
discipline to have it's good against

2272.56 --> 2277.66
that it helps you deal with that too

2275.859 --> 2280.359
because there is going to be an

2277.66 --> 2282.2799999999997
increasing amount of Hysteria coming out

2280.359 --> 2285.94
of all this and mindfulness will be very

2282.28 --> 2288.5400000000004
useful to have when you face that

2285.94 --> 2288.54
anyway

2297.56 --> 2302.2
[Music]

2299.26 --> 2304.96
it's overall positive yes it is

2302.2 --> 2307.2999999999997
it also helps to deal with like anxiety

2304.96 --> 2308.32
and all kinds of things if you have that

2307.3 --> 2310.78
issue

2308.32 --> 2312.4
it's very useful

2310.78 --> 2316.0
but

2312.4 --> 2318.52
it can also make you isolate yourself in

2316.0 --> 2319.96
blissfulness

2318.52 --> 2323.2
right

2319.96 --> 2327.2400000000002
people can use it to basically trap

2323.2 --> 2327.24
themselves into ignorance

2327.579 --> 2331.7200000000003
right it's power and what is what is you

2330.46 --> 2334.7200000000003
what are you going to do with that power

2331.72 --> 2336.7
is your ego Gonna Take It

2334.72 --> 2340.4199999999996
and then basically

2336.7 --> 2341.859
like oh I just don't wanna deal with all

2340.42 --> 2344.2000000000003
those things

2341.859 --> 2347.3199999999997
so I'm going to erase it for my mind

2344.2 --> 2350.02
sort of like what sjws do when they're

2347.32 --> 2353.1400000000003
like oh these things that I hate I don't

2350.02 --> 2355.54
want them to exist anymore

2353.14 --> 2356.74
we need our safe space

2355.54 --> 2359.079
yeah

2356.74 --> 2362.3999999999996
it can lead to that too

2359.079 --> 2362.4
if you're not careful

2367.01 --> 2374.719
[Music]

2374.8 --> 2380.92
right

2376.73 --> 2384.359
[Music]

2380.92 --> 2384.359
that's just delusional

2388.359 --> 2394.839
a lot of people coming online waking up

2391.54 --> 2397.599
are they right back I think a lot of

2394.839 --> 2399.82
people are just kind of roaming around a

2397.599 --> 2401.7400000000002
bit bored on the internet and they just

2399.82 --> 2404.44
want a good story time right they just

2401.74 --> 2405.52
won the story time

2404.44 --> 2406.78
it's like

2405.52 --> 2409.3
remember

2406.78 --> 2412.42
50 years ago

2409.3 --> 2414.3390000000004
well I wasn't there 50 years ago but I

2412.42 --> 2415.66
can imagine I still when I was alive it

2414.339 --> 2417.7599999999998
was still a thing it's just like

2415.66 --> 2419.74
storytelling time

2417.76 --> 2423.46
when you go to bed

2419.74 --> 2426.3999999999996
and your mom maybe your dad likes reads

2423.46 --> 2429.78
from like a book maybe fairy tales or

2426.4 --> 2432.46
I don't know science fiction whatever

2429.78 --> 2434.7400000000002
happened with you

2432.46 --> 2439.54
and

2434.74 --> 2441.7
like oh the dreams man like my mom

2439.54 --> 2442.96
read to me when I was quite Young on The

2441.7 --> 2444.9399999999996
Hobbit

2442.96 --> 2447.339
when I was like really young and I

2444.94 --> 2449.5
didn't really understand it but it was

2447.339 --> 2451.9
barely listening but what I heard was

2449.5 --> 2455.2
like I was just experiencing a movie

2451.9 --> 2458.38
around me from her reading that story

2455.2 --> 2460.839
like I got so inspired by it it's just

2458.38 --> 2462.6400000000003
like I would just dream dream I would be

2460.839 --> 2467.2599999999998
stuck in that dream

2462.64 --> 2470.319
for a long time the next day still and

2467.26 --> 2472.7200000000003
so inspired right that's basically what

2470.319 --> 2476.38
people want on the internet a lot they

2472.72 --> 2478.24
just want the good story time

2476.38 --> 2480.339
they just want to kind of get back into

2478.24 --> 2483.3999999999996
oh the dream

2480.339 --> 2485.92
because that felt good they get

2483.4 --> 2487.2400000000002
nostalgic in a way perhaps

2485.92 --> 2490.54
they wouldn't want to get it back

2487.24 --> 2492.5989999999997
because the world is getting so grim and

2490.54 --> 2495.22
desensitized and

2492.599 --> 2498.28
deranged and then you wanted more and

2495.22 --> 2501.4599999999996
you won good story time right but

2498.28 --> 2505.3
if you just want good story time

2501.46 --> 2507.64
you're also going to avoid

2505.3 --> 2510.099
that you're going to avoid the things

2507.64 --> 2514.2
you don't like

2510.099 --> 2514.2000000000003
and that could be even confrontation

2514.42 --> 2521.2200000000003
confrontation with the things you don't

2516.7 --> 2521.22
like ignore them I don't know so

2522.52 --> 2528.819
yeah a lot of people eventually end up

2525.04 --> 2532.24
just watching some conspiracy video of

2528.819 --> 2535.359
some kind or maybe fear porn related

2532.24 --> 2538.1189999999997
conspiracy video and they'll just let it

2535.359 --> 2540.339
all in they'll let them like make them

2538.119 --> 2541.359
believe it in the moment they just allow

2540.339 --> 2544.0
that

2541.359 --> 2545.859
and then those videos might even like

2544.0 --> 2547.3
change their directive in ways

2545.859 --> 2550.48
temporarily

2547.3 --> 2552.78
even though they really don't even have

2550.48 --> 2554.619
foundational

2552.78 --> 2557.3190000000004
insights

2554.619 --> 2559.119
it's like a hype it's over hyped it's

2557.319 --> 2561.46
more entertainment it's like

2559.119 --> 2564.579
infotainment like things that could

2561.46 --> 2566.92
potentially be and then assumed to be

2564.579 --> 2569.94
and then pushed with the emotional

2566.92 --> 2569.94
reaction of that

2570.22 --> 2576.7599999999998
and

2572.38 --> 2579.819
yeah to find actual people out there

2576.76 --> 2582.46
even that watch the internet and videos

2579.819 --> 2584.02
even into conspiracy to find one of

2582.46 --> 2586.7200000000003
those that are

2584.02 --> 2589.3
like taking it serious and they're

2586.72 --> 2594.7
realized like yeah some of this is

2589.3 --> 2596.44
[ __ ] here's how you can tell right

2594.7 --> 2598.0
where are those people where are the

2596.44 --> 2599.619
people you're just gonna bump into in

2598.0 --> 2601.9
the street might like oh what do you

2599.619 --> 2604.9
think about this that'll tell you yeah I

2601.9 --> 2607.9
figured out a way how to tell

2604.9 --> 2610.859
and that they're right

2607.9 --> 2610.859
where's that

2611.98 --> 2617.619
where's people sharing their how to

2615.099 --> 2621.339
figure it out skills

2617.619 --> 2624.119
I mean I try to do this all the time as

2621.339 --> 2624.119
much as I can

2627.94 --> 2632.92
this is almost all I do it's just

2630.7 --> 2634.5989999999997
explain exactly how I'm figuring it out

2632.92 --> 2636.579
the patterns the structures that I'm

2634.599 --> 2638.27
seeing

2636.579 --> 2641.429
foreign

2638.27 --> 2641.429
[Music]

2642.78 --> 2648.52
unfortunately just a great majority

2646.48 --> 2651.339
they might even have hints of wanting to

2648.52 --> 2654.119
be informed but the majority just wants

2651.339 --> 2656.319
to be entertained or like a kid

2654.119 --> 2658.2400000000002
Fantastical story time and they want to

2656.319 --> 2660.7
dream about it not really doing anything

2658.24 --> 2662.859
with it maybe or maybe they're like even

2660.7 --> 2664.359
doing art with it right

2662.859 --> 2666.88
who would blame him

2664.359 --> 2671.14
if just weird stories or whatever

2666.88 --> 2674.079
inspire you to paint something

2671.14 --> 2676.72
then just do that

2674.079 --> 2679.48
But realize that

2676.72 --> 2683.339
unless you actually start figuring out

2679.48 --> 2683.339
what is real how can you tell

2683.44 --> 2689.56
you're delivered to just chaos

2687.4 --> 2692.38
the things that you don't understand

2689.56 --> 2695.0789999999997
that you're taking for granted

2692.38 --> 2697.3
and it's gonna be off it's gonna make

2695.079 --> 2699.4
you make mistakes if it it really

2697.3 --> 2699.86
becomes important that's what's going to

2699.4 --> 2701.26
happen

2699.86 --> 2703.92
[Music]

2701.26 --> 2703.92
anyway

2705.05 --> 2708.2490000000003
[Music]

2712.66 --> 2717.8599999999997
[Music]

2720.839 --> 2724.98
nde channels what is that

2730.3 --> 2736.38
what's an nde Channel

2733.54 --> 2736.38
right back

2745.06 --> 2749.7599999999998
oh okay right your death experience

2750.28 --> 2755.44
right well let's break back let's just

2753.819 --> 2759.94
establish

2755.44 --> 2763.56
near-death experiences exist

2759.94 --> 2763.56
they're remarkable

2763.839 --> 2769.7799999999997
does that help you with anything though

2766.54 --> 2772.72
like what practical skills

2769.78 --> 2774.579
can you get out of

2772.72 --> 2775.8999999999996
knowing everything about near-death

2774.579 --> 2779.619
experiences

2775.9 --> 2782.98
like no one right that is oh somebody

2779.619 --> 2786.4
just almost died and they had this dream

2782.98 --> 2789.4
and you can see it in their eyes and

2786.4 --> 2790.599
it might be nervous about it might want

2789.4 --> 2793.54
to forget it

2790.599 --> 2796.3
well you realizing what it could be

2793.54 --> 2799.66
could help you to actually encourage

2796.3 --> 2802.0
them and give them Comfort like it's

2799.66 --> 2805.96
okay I I understand these things I've

2802.0 --> 2808.54
studied that tell me about it

2805.96 --> 2810.4
then you can

2808.54 --> 2813.04
help people

2810.4 --> 2814.1800000000003
connect to those experiences if they've

2813.04 --> 2815.98
had them

2814.18 --> 2817.54
right that's what you can get out of and

2815.98 --> 2818.98
that's about it

2817.54 --> 2821.14
because what are you gonna do you're

2818.98 --> 2823.9
going to seek out near-death experiences

2821.14 --> 2824.64
right oh I know you know there's a

2823.9 --> 2827.44
certain

2824.64 --> 2829.42
eugenicist group that would love people

2827.44 --> 2832.18
to do that and that's probably why

2829.42 --> 2836.079
near-death experiences are just like a

2832.18 --> 2838.7799999999997
mainstream subject like aliens

2836.079 --> 2840.28
in the alternative sector

2838.78 --> 2843.579
right

2840.28 --> 2845.44
because they love the things that people

2843.579 --> 2847.8390000000004
that don't completely know what they're

2845.44 --> 2851.079
doing and get into that that they can

2847.839 --> 2852.7599999999998
get like seriously trapped that's the

2851.079 --> 2854.98
things they love that's the things they

2852.76 --> 2858.42
push forward to the to the front line

2854.98 --> 2858.42
the eugenicist

2858.52 --> 2862.72
right if it's

2860.98 --> 2865.839
not

2862.72 --> 2869.14
ambiguous in a spiritual way

2865.839 --> 2871.599
in some way if it doesn't pose a risk in

2869.14 --> 2874.66
some way that could slip through then

2871.599 --> 2878.46
they don't like those subjects to be

2874.66 --> 2878.46
front line in the attention

2879.64 --> 2882.8799999999997
yeah

2880.839 --> 2886.72
and the funny thing is this is so

2882.88 --> 2889.3
systematic this is so fractively applied

2886.72 --> 2891.66
that you can literally at this point

2889.3 --> 2894.3390000000004
like point at people their success level

2891.66 --> 2898.24
and then like

2894.339 --> 2901.359
measure out a counter opposite

2898.24 --> 2903.819
level of danger it's like oh they're

2901.359 --> 2906.4
that successful well then you have to

2903.819 --> 2909.819
recognize that they're this amount of

2906.4 --> 2912.46
danger or evil hidden behind it or it

2909.819 --> 2914.5
just wouldn't have been allowed to be

2912.46 --> 2917.079
that successful

2914.5 --> 2919.72
you can even apply that to like super

2917.079 --> 2922.2400000000002
rich people and everything

2919.72 --> 2925.4399999999996
right and people already do that they

2922.24 --> 2925.4399999999996
just don't really know

2926.38 --> 2931.1800000000003
how to

2928.42 --> 2934.1800000000003
really Pin It Down

2931.18 --> 2936.7599999999998
but there is this effect going on it and

2934.18 --> 2939.7
I think it has to do also with Envy it's

2936.76 --> 2941.44
the Envy of power people that have power

2939.7 --> 2943.8999999999996
have a lot of money or whatever grip

2941.44 --> 2947.26
they get envious to those that attain

2943.9 --> 2949.78
that power without sacrifices

2947.26 --> 2952.599
that just naturally get it from God and

2949.78 --> 2955.7200000000003
claim it they get jealous they attack

2952.599 --> 2960.4
them for that it's like you don't have

2955.72 --> 2962.6189999999997
you didn't sacrifice enough on the altar

2960.4 --> 2965.619
that kind of attitude

2962.619 --> 2969.2200000000003
really I've seen that happen I've seen

2965.619 --> 2970.3
people do that to me try to do that to

2969.22 --> 2973.54
me

2970.3 --> 2975.52
because I was like seething with power

2973.54 --> 2979.2
at moments and I just showed it to them

2975.52 --> 2979.2
I was like I am here

2979.48 --> 2983.559
and they would be like you're not

2981.339 --> 2985.66
allowed to do that

2983.559 --> 2987.7000000000003
and didn't make any sense and it was

2985.66 --> 2991.42
just jealousy

2987.7 --> 2992.74
and the Habit like ritualizing that

2991.42 --> 2995.819
jealousy

2992.74 --> 2995.819
that's what they've done

2996.94 --> 3005.18
it's like the thing to do

3000.48 --> 3005.18
to like the people in the Beast sister

3008.04 --> 3012.599
which power did I have the same that I

3010.38 --> 3016.1400000000003
do now

3012.599 --> 3018.6600000000003
the power to see the power to see unlike

3016.14 --> 3022.5
microscopic level to have like a full

3018.66 --> 3024.839
scope fractal View and control over it

3022.5 --> 3028.559
and especially control over how to

3024.839 --> 3030.9
explain it even to those that do not or

3028.559 --> 3032.94
would not typically have that level of

3030.9 --> 3035.839
grasp onto it yeah

3032.94 --> 3035.839
that power

3036.18 --> 3041.4199999999996
power of revealing divining Oracle

3050.04 --> 3055.16
and it is conditional it requires

3057.72 --> 3062.8799999999997
living in a certain way not doing

3060.119 --> 3066.319
certain things with your spirit for me

3062.88 --> 3068.6400000000003
it is required like

3066.319 --> 3072.119
decompartmentalization of my inner mind

3068.64 --> 3074.96
with my public

3072.119 --> 3074.96
interaction

3075.359 --> 3081.96
like I don't allow myself

3078.66 --> 3084.98
to think things that I would not be able

3081.96 --> 3084.98
to justify

3088.44 --> 3093.2400000000002
very tough because for a lot of people

3090.42 --> 3096.119
it's their secret space that's the last

3093.24 --> 3099.359
place where you can just squirt right

3096.119 --> 3103.02
yeah well guess what if you want to

3099.359 --> 3104.0989999999997
attune to absolute truth and be able to

3103.02 --> 3106.7599999999998
like

3104.099 --> 3109.2000000000003
Divine things pure you have to

3106.76 --> 3110.579
decompartmentalize it and it's like yeah

3109.2 --> 3114.1189999999997
you just

3110.579 --> 3116.76
you just never do it wrong ever in your

3114.119 --> 3118.619
dreams in your imagination in your

3116.76 --> 3120.42
physical interactions

3118.619 --> 3124.02
always

3120.42 --> 3126.1800000000003
walk there never deviate never really

3124.02 --> 3130.2
and if you do

3126.18 --> 3134.94
then with understanding and a plan and

3130.2 --> 3137.22
knowledge and like acceptance of what

3134.94 --> 3139.079
the consequences will be or will

3137.22 --> 3142.02
potentially be

3139.079 --> 3145.8590000000004
just being real at all time

3142.02 --> 3148.8
never stepping away from being that real

3145.859 --> 3152.359
not even in my imagination always being

3148.8 --> 3152.3590000000004
that that's what it takes

3159.0 --> 3164.78
right it's not like I have to like shut

3161.04 --> 3168.48
down my imagination at all it actually

3164.78 --> 3171.3
completely gives me my imagination

3168.48 --> 3173.339
it gives me so much flexibility with my

3171.3 --> 3176.7000000000003
imagination because now

3173.339 --> 3179.7799999999997
it's been properly based

3176.7 --> 3179.7799999999997
when I imagine

3180.599 --> 3186.48
and I explain things it has a it has a

3183.78 --> 3188.94
proper containment

3186.48 --> 3191.76
because of the rules and the discipline

3188.94 --> 3194.94
and it actually gives me effectively

3191.76 --> 3196.98
more freedom and control over it

3194.94 --> 3198.51
yeah

3196.98 --> 3200.22
right

3198.51 --> 3203.4
[Music]

3200.22 --> 3206.7599999999998
and that's that's like the

3203.4 --> 3207.78
great mystery maybe Mysteries to run for

3206.76 --> 3213.7400000000002
it

3207.78 --> 3213.7400000000002
it's like an ironic mechanism that

3213.839 --> 3220.819
discipline

3216.0 --> 3220.819
actually provides freedom

3221.7 --> 3226.74
it's the only thing that actually

3224.579 --> 3230.28
provides freedom

3226.74 --> 3233.7
right and that's like directly you could

3230.28 --> 3234.8390000000004
directly connect that to like yeah you

3233.7 --> 3237.48
have to

3234.839 --> 3239.72
fight for your right you have to defend

3237.48 --> 3241.92
them

3239.72 --> 3244.68
that is

3241.92 --> 3246.54
what really gives it to you

3244.68 --> 3249.1189999999997
discipline

3246.54 --> 3251.579
discipline Freedom that's the real

3249.119 --> 3253.319
freedom freedom is not oh you could do

3251.579 --> 3255.059
whatever the [ __ ] you want without no

3253.319 --> 3258.359
consequences

3255.059 --> 3262.2000000000003
that's false Freedom that's

3258.359 --> 3264.48
freedom to not be connected

3262.2 --> 3267.6099999999997
right you could say that's luciferian

3264.48 --> 3268.859
Freedom while wildness deviancy

3267.61 --> 3271.98
[Music]

3268.859 --> 3274.98
freedom to be deviant

3271.98 --> 3274.98
defiance

3275.819 --> 3283.5
but the actual Freedom like the ability

3279.42 --> 3285.6800000000003
range options right Freedom real freedom

3283.5 --> 3287.48
is options

3285.68 --> 3290.3999999999996
discipline

3287.48 --> 3293.94
provides options

3290.4 --> 3295.619
options are true freedom

3293.94 --> 3297.0
discipline

3295.619 --> 3300.78
is

3297.0 --> 3300.78
creates freedom

3301.859 --> 3306.319
see it's that basic

3308.48 --> 3315.02
because it is that basic even people

3312.059 --> 3315.02
that are not

3315.26 --> 3320.4
Giants in reasoning or have like this

3318.42 --> 3323.819
Fantastical vernacular

3320.4 --> 3326.28
can still hold on to that discipline

3323.819 --> 3328.319
because it's so simple

3326.28 --> 3330.42
if the mechanic's so simple you don't

3328.319 --> 3332.46
have to be a genius to hold on to that

3330.42 --> 3336.299
and get it

3332.46 --> 3339.9
right it's simple it's effective

3336.299 --> 3343.099
it works works when you're simple it

3339.9 --> 3343.099
works when you're complicated

3351.27 --> 3354.429
[Music]

3378.599 --> 3383.599
you never had a out of body expert okay

3380.819 --> 3383.599
right back well

3387.18 --> 3390.44
how are your dreams

3394.26 --> 3401.46
right you look if an out-of-body

3397.619 --> 3404.88
experience is necessary this is like

3401.46 --> 3407.04
fate speak in a way this is a woozy if

3404.88 --> 3410.599
it's necessary then it'll happen to you

3407.04 --> 3410.599
don't seek it out

3411.599 --> 3416.88
right learn what you can from it but

3414.24 --> 3419.819
don't don't seek that sort of thing out

3416.88 --> 3421.079
like what's the point

3419.819 --> 3424.2599999999998
right

3421.079 --> 3427.98
think about it like this

3424.26 --> 3430.76
is it good to have your spirit detached

3427.98 --> 3430.76
from your body

3431.64 --> 3437.52
because for example my healer

3434.579 --> 3439.6800000000003
like it's number one

3437.52 --> 3442.799
lesson every time is

3439.68 --> 3446.3999999999996
be in your body

3442.799 --> 3449.579
yeah that's how you stay well that's how

3446.4 --> 3451.559
your body functions properly that's how

3449.579 --> 3453.599
you stay Earth that's how you're here to

3451.559 --> 3456.9
do what you're supposed to do

3453.599 --> 3459.48
so out of Body Experience

3456.9 --> 3462.359
you know fundamentally is the exact

3459.48 --> 3464.54
opposite of that right

3462.359 --> 3467.5989999999997
is that something you really want to

3464.54 --> 3470.04
experience I mean if it's gonna happen

3467.599 --> 3471.54
then yeah then you'll have some

3470.04 --> 3473.94
knowledge about it and then you have

3471.54 --> 3477.119
something to reflect upon afterward or

3473.94 --> 3479.579
during even though it depends right

3477.119 --> 3481.26
but just because you know about it does

3479.579 --> 3484.02
not mean that you should allow yourself

3481.26 --> 3485.099
to kind of obsess over it and seek it

3484.02 --> 3487.68
out

3485.099 --> 3489.96
don't do that

3487.68 --> 3491.64
right just because you have some kind of

3489.96 --> 3494.96
power within knowledge doesn't mean that

3491.64 --> 3494.96
you have to then use it

3497.04 --> 3500.22
right

3498.119 --> 3502.079
if it happens then you know something

3500.22 --> 3503.64
about it

3502.079 --> 3507.799
but don't

3503.64 --> 3507.799
seek that out that's just creepy

3510.26 --> 3515.8390000000004
I don't know I don't use it from the

3513.54 --> 3515.839
grave

3517.26 --> 3520.46
I don't recommend it

3527.04 --> 3531.599
I mean I've had

3528.96 --> 3534.119
a hallucinogenic experience that were

3531.599 --> 3537.059
well as closest out of body if you could

3534.119 --> 3540.42
ever imagine right but I was not like oh

3537.059 --> 3542.8190000000004
I'm looking at my body lying there

3540.42 --> 3544.079
in the physical world that's never

3542.819 --> 3547.079
happened

3544.079 --> 3551.3390000000004
but I have been like through

3547.079 --> 3554.04
totally surreal and very cohesive

3551.339 --> 3557.46
but chaotic

3554.04 --> 3559.68
I would yeah like experience where the

3557.46 --> 3562.26
dream is basically I'm out of my body

3559.68 --> 3564.18
it's like a Holodeck

3562.26 --> 3567.619
and everything is but there's other

3564.18 --> 3570.7799999999997
things there and there are like

3567.619 --> 3573.9
compartmentalized parts of my own being

3570.78 --> 3574.8590000000004
separate from the experiencer of that

3573.9 --> 3580.14
moment

3574.859 --> 3583.2599999999998
so it's like I am one of four parts of

3580.14 --> 3585.0589999999997
myself in that experience separate and

3583.26 --> 3587.2200000000003
three other things

3585.059 --> 3589.88
are also me

3587.22 --> 3595.5
but

3589.88 --> 3597.78
I'm not from their perspective

3595.5 --> 3599.76
they didn't even have my face

3597.78 --> 3602.52
they looked like some somebody else

3599.76 --> 3605.0
which is very weird and confusing it

3602.52 --> 3605.0
sometimes

3605.07 --> 3607.559
[Music]

3606.48 --> 3609.2400000000002
so

3607.559 --> 3611.3390000000004
don't

3609.24 --> 3614.299
yeah don't get into

3611.339 --> 3614.299
things that

3614.4 --> 3618.44
that might just cause trouble for you

3630.839 --> 3635.7799999999997
oh our body experience no doubt in your

3633.059 --> 3635.78
death oh right right

3640.74 --> 3647.839
to limit myself like suggesting it's

3643.079 --> 3647.8390000000004
because it is right back it is

3649.92 --> 3657.14
it's risky it's risky to have your

3653.339 --> 3657.14
spirit detached from your body

3658.079 --> 3664.1400000000003
right you might not be vulnerable to

3661.02 --> 3668.46
like physical harm in a direct sense

3664.14 --> 3673.0789999999997
but your spirit can also attain harm

3668.46 --> 3675.5
and that can reflect upon your Waking

3673.079 --> 3675.5
Life

3680.22 --> 3683.66
it's very tricky

3696.61 --> 3699.989
[Music]

3701.4 --> 3705.42
ah

3702.599 --> 3710.059
right yep psych bear Jesus can you

3705.42 --> 3710.059
imagine that like being on like

3710.22 --> 3717.1189999999997
like LSD or something bad that that

3713.64 --> 3719.0989999999997
they're not like look outside like Out

3717.119 --> 3720.9
of Body Experience type thing but like

3719.099 --> 3723.1800000000003
still in the real world but just heavily

3720.9 --> 3727.46
tripping and then like getting on a

3723.18 --> 3727.46
Ouija board that just like ah dude

3727.559 --> 3730.3390000000004
uh

3730.559 --> 3737.48
that seems like a very bad combination

3734.35 --> 3737.48
[Music]

3744.0 --> 3748.03
normal is not a thing anymore but it was

3747.24 --> 3751.4889999999996
never a thing

3748.03 --> 3751.489
[Music]

3755.599 --> 3760.7400000000002
I mean normal is

3759.119 --> 3763.559
a convention

3760.74 --> 3766.339
and it is contemporary it's always

3763.559 --> 3766.3390000000004
contemporary

3768.359 --> 3774.0
but yeah it is root normal is rooted in

3772.619 --> 3778.079
a balance

3774.0 --> 3780.72
and Necessities right and so

3778.079 --> 3783.319
my camera just freeze

3780.72 --> 3783.319
yep

3789.359 --> 3792.2
all right

3792.35 --> 3798.24
[Music]

3795.0 --> 3802.03
is there anything more powerful than my

3798.24 --> 3805.3489999999997
awareness that exists

3802.03 --> 3805.349
[Music]

3806.819 --> 3811.4
that's a

3808.319 --> 3811.4
tricky question

3813.72 --> 3820.2599999999998
I mean I like in my dark world time it's

3817.02 --> 3823.16
not like I did my best to like check out

3820.26 --> 3823.1600000000003
every Power

3826.5 --> 3832.26
I don't know

3829.26 --> 3837.079
I think there's things out there more

3832.26 --> 3837.079
powerful than me in ways

3837.359 --> 3843.7799999999997
but in what I do

3840.9 --> 3847.7000000000003
the disciplines that I follow

3843.78 --> 3847.7000000000003
I've yet to meet my match

3847.859 --> 3853.68
and there's people very close to it

3850.68 --> 3857.5989999999997
still that like in ways

3853.68 --> 3857.5989999999997
that I resonate with so much

3858.24 --> 3864.6189999999997
and that they inspire me right but it

3860.88 --> 3864.619
might not be mutual I don't know

3871.38 --> 3874.319
that's why you see it as limiting

3873.24 --> 3877.7
yourself

3874.319 --> 3877.7
no yeah but

3880.44 --> 3887.78
look I have a lot break back dude I have

3883.799 --> 3890.64
a lot of damage like spiritual

3887.78 --> 3893.039
feedback damage that I'm still dealing

3890.64 --> 3896.0989999999997
with with crazy things that I've

3893.039 --> 3899.059
experienced like even 20 years ago and

3896.099 --> 3899.059
around that time

3900.96 --> 3906.059
that's why I'm saying like be careful

3903.66 --> 3908.8799999999997
with this is like the damage you get is

3906.059 --> 3910.619
like it literally can change your entire

3908.88 --> 3912.6600000000003
being

3910.619 --> 3916.02
like whatever you could have potentially

3912.66 --> 3919.339
achieved might be gone forever and

3916.02 --> 3919.339
you're just a different person

3919.5 --> 3925.859
that does not have that

3922.26 --> 3925.8590000000004
fate anymore

3925.98 --> 3931.88
okay

3927.539 --> 3931.88
don't mess with the program

3932.4 --> 3937.799
unless like there is an imminent Doom

3935.819 --> 3940.079
and that's kind of the problem that I

3937.799 --> 3942.299
had that's even what the the idea of an

3940.079 --> 3944.6400000000003
imminent Doom that I have been feeling

3942.299 --> 3946.799
in response to just the world but it

3944.64 --> 3950.24
might just be my oversensitivity and not

3946.799 --> 3950.24
me not getting it

3950.94 --> 3955.859
but that imminent Doom sensation is the

3954.059 --> 3959.6400000000003
thing that kind of pulled me into it

3955.859 --> 3962.0389999999998
like I was like I have to

3959.64 --> 3965.46
defend the world

3962.039 --> 3967.44
like all of it and the spirit realm I

3965.46 --> 3969.539
have like there's this thing going

3967.44 --> 3970.859
happening like I really think like I

3969.539 --> 3973.8590000000004
have to prevent the end of the world

3970.859 --> 3976.619
that's basically it right and it was

3973.859 --> 3979.14
really serious

3976.619 --> 3982.079
and I like felt the preliminaries of

3979.14 --> 3985.14
that even like as a very young kid

3982.079 --> 3989.8390000000004
it's like I have to do this thing and

3985.14 --> 3989.839
nobody will get it or almost nobody

3992.099 --> 3995.299
like a destiny

3997.44 --> 4006.099
and people have that I told beside my

4001.16 --> 4006.0989999999997
parents they have like scoffed at that

4007.46 --> 4011.2400000000002
scoffed at me and say like no that's all

4009.68 --> 4012.9199999999996
[ __ ] you don't have a destiny there

4011.24 --> 4014.5389999999998
is no Destiny there's no this there's no

4012.92 --> 4018.039
that

4014.539 --> 4018.039
and I've just been holding on

4019.039 --> 4024.88
but it has also made me do some very

4022.099 --> 4024.88
stupid things

4027.68 --> 4032.96
like

4029.799 --> 4036.68
initiating and doing things when I did

4032.96 --> 4038.299
when I I knew I didn't truly fully

4036.68 --> 4040.16
understand everything that I was

4038.299 --> 4043.0
promoting

4040.16 --> 4043.0
that part

4051.2 --> 4053.74
anyway

4071.78 --> 4078.799
okay

4074.68 --> 4081.0789999999997
XXX I don't get it exactly

4078.799 --> 4083.18
but yeah Karma

4081.079 --> 4086.48
right

4083.18 --> 4090.14
look karma is just a basic conception

4086.48 --> 4092.18
that is very easily easily for people to

4090.14 --> 4094.2799999999997
just relate to like life interaction

4092.18 --> 4095.7799999999997
social interactions

4094.28 --> 4098.779
right

4095.78 --> 4100.759
but when it comes to spiritual travel

4098.779 --> 4103.88
you could say inter-dimensional

4100.759 --> 4106.48
activities out of body experiences hella

4103.88 --> 4106.4800000000005
synergetics

4106.819 --> 4111.1
like the weight is more

4124.219 --> 4131.359
where is Effie going Effie is going

4127.52 --> 4134.859
nowhere it's right here it's stationary

4131.359 --> 4134.859
and it's here to stay

4135.14 --> 4139.9400000000005
we've won

4137.839 --> 4142.58
right but yeah

4139.94 --> 4146.96
because we've won

4142.58 --> 4149.719
uh yeah it's like eventually the

4146.96 --> 4151.1
the fresh passion of like oh we

4149.719 --> 4153.799
discovered this

4151.1 --> 4156.02
it will kind of run out and the trolls

4153.799 --> 4158.659
will keep whining and pushing still

4156.02 --> 4160.819
right it's very tough to hold out it's

4158.659 --> 4162.62
like being in a in a fortress in

4160.819 --> 4164.54
pandemonium

4162.62 --> 4167.0
and it's never going to stop but the

4164.54 --> 4168.799
energy will like keep decreasing unless

4167.0 --> 4170.96
new people get into it

4168.799 --> 4172.759
and they will then have fresh energy to

4170.96 --> 4175.52
kind of reinvigorate everybody else

4172.759 --> 4178.339
that's in the Fortress

4175.52 --> 4181.339000000001
but like the demon hordes

4178.339 --> 4183.199
in this case metaphorically the ballers

4181.339 --> 4184.8189999999995
they will keep coming

4183.199 --> 4186.44
and they're getting like some of them

4184.819 --> 4187.55
are getting worse they're anti-flat

4186.44 --> 4190.709
earthers are worse even

4187.55 --> 4190.709
[Music]

4195.86 --> 4202.299999999999
we need to push what do you mean we need

4199.1 --> 4202.3
to push push what

4202.4 --> 4208.46
what push retardation onto the field

4205.34 --> 4211.76
what you have to spill forth your

4208.46 --> 4213.44
your impulsivity you just have to do

4211.76 --> 4215.96
something oh really you have to do

4213.44 --> 4218.139999999999
something when you don't actually have a

4215.96 --> 4218.14
plan

4218.3 --> 4222.28
because you want to do something with it

4222.62 --> 4228.0199999999995
well why don't you instead

4225.62 --> 4231.14
work Inward and

4228.02 --> 4234.4400000000005
figure things out even more

4231.14 --> 4236.719
sharpen up sharpen up onto knowing what

4234.44 --> 4238.94
is real what is not real sharpen up on

4236.719 --> 4241.64
your sensories figure out propaganda

4238.94 --> 4245.0199999999995
figure out social engineering figure out

4241.64 --> 4245.02
how people response

4246.44 --> 4251.36
why don't you push there

4249.08 --> 4255.64
instead of just wanting to be another

4251.36 --> 4255.639999999999
blabbermouth getting into people's faces

4260.36 --> 4263.42
right

4262.1 --> 4266.780000000001
because

4263.42 --> 4268.82
if you're just able to explain Flat

4266.78 --> 4271.759999999999
Earth on different levels

4268.82 --> 4274.88
then if somebody is willing to learn

4271.76 --> 4278.3
about it then you can oblige

4274.88 --> 4280.400000000001
in this on the spot if necessary yeah if

4278.3 --> 4282.679
you're gonna go out and just get in

4280.4 --> 4285.199
people's faces that didn't necessarily

4282.679 --> 4288.92
want to learn about that

4285.199 --> 4291.08
that's not good it's just gonna yeah

4288.92 --> 4293.2390000000005
create Bad Seed they're not gonna

4291.08 --> 4295.46
appreciate it and even if you were right

4293.239 --> 4298.94
even if you were explaining it elegantly

4295.46 --> 4300.38
if the feeling's off if the will is not

4298.94 --> 4304.339999999999
right

4300.38 --> 4307.9400000000005
then they will not learn it

4304.34 --> 4310.76
because they will be distracted by the

4307.94 --> 4313.28
offness of the feelings the the weird

4310.76 --> 4316.6990000000005
hostility

4313.28 --> 4319.94
so just introspective learn more learn

4316.699 --> 4321.799999999999
about people more right Flat Earth we

4319.94 --> 4325.159
know about Flat Earth now

4321.8 --> 4327.62
we know a lot about it

4325.159 --> 4330.5599999999995
and we know what we don't know about it

4327.62 --> 4333.14
and people insisted to keep building on

4330.56 --> 4334.9400000000005
those air castles

4333.14 --> 4336.679
that's their own problem it's their own

4334.94 --> 4339.379999999999

4336.679 --> 4341.0
right you don't need to do that it

4339.38 --> 4344.42
doesn't help

4341.0 --> 4347.06
doesn't lead to eventually getting a

4344.42 --> 4349.659
grip on it making it real that's not

4347.06 --> 4349.659000000001
going to happen

4351.199 --> 4355.04
but

4352.76 --> 4358.1
you can learn about people

4355.04 --> 4359.179
and then yeah you want everybody to get

4358.1 --> 4362.96
Flat Earth

4359.179 --> 4366.38
well then you have to get people first

4362.96 --> 4367.94
when you get people then you can learn

4366.38 --> 4371.9800000000005
how

4367.94 --> 4374.36
to more effectively transform people

4371.98 --> 4377.799999999999
that don't know about Flat Earth to

4374.36 --> 4377.799999999999
people that know about Flat Earth

4380.9 --> 4387.739
right and not just give it a push

4384.94 --> 4390.0199999999995
letters letters oh everybody heard Flat

4387.739 --> 4391.459999999999
Earth and then uh goes away again and

4390.02 --> 4394.6
everybody has like yeah that's flatter

4391.46 --> 4394.6
there's a kind of retardant

4394.76 --> 4398.06
yeah

4396.199 --> 4400.82
because they just sound stupid and loud

4398.06 --> 4402.38
and don't seem to really understand what

4400.82 --> 4405.82
they're talking about

4402.38 --> 4405.82
that's what you don't want

4409.28 --> 4412.0599999999995
anyways

4412.88 --> 4415.88
foreign

4419.4 --> 4423.96
[Music]

4425.44 --> 4429.699
snacks that's hilarious

4434.179 --> 4437.9
right

4435.32 --> 4440.0599999999995
it well it is kind of an interesting you

4437.9 --> 4441.139999999999
could have like Flat Earth pizzas and

4440.06 --> 4443.1990000000005
like have

4441.14 --> 4447.860000000001
I guess a

4443.199 --> 4450.379999999999
disc Flat Earth map projection unlike

4447.86 --> 4453.679
the bottom of the pizza box

4450.38 --> 4456.26
and as you eat the pizza you get to see

4453.679 --> 4459.08
the Flat Earth picture right that that

4456.26 --> 4461.7390000000005
sort of sure you could do that

4459.08 --> 4461.739
why not

4462.199 --> 4466.339999999999
I mean that would basically fall under

4464.48 --> 4468.199
art

4466.34 --> 4470.9800000000005
right

4468.199 --> 4470.98
and

4471.86 --> 4475.0599999999995
I mean don't yeah

4475.58 --> 4480.32
don't necessarily have the words flatter

4477.86 --> 4482.659
they're just half the picture and then

4480.32 --> 4484.88
I'd say like yeah sure you could

4482.659 --> 4488.12
literally just put that under

4484.88 --> 4490.34
unsuspecting people's noses

4488.12 --> 4492.08
but if you're going to like say flatter

4490.34 --> 4494.659000000001
Flat Earth and really consciously

4492.08 --> 4497.739
confront somebody with flat Earth

4494.659 --> 4497.739
that's very different

4498.62 --> 4503.96
right that's like flat smacking

4501.739 --> 4506.44
terrible name that really is flat

4503.96 --> 4506.44
smacking

4515.78 --> 4524.84
but yeah why not you know pizza box

4520.76 --> 4527.06
have a print or like a sticker of a flat

4524.84 --> 4529.04
Earth Map not with the words Flat Earth

4527.06 --> 4531.9800000000005
on it just the picture

4529.04 --> 4534.56
have it on the bottom of a pizza box

4531.98 --> 4535.639999999999
as the people pick the pizza pieces out

4534.56 --> 4538.6990000000005
of it

4535.64 --> 4542.4400000000005
that they see like hey what's that

4538.699 --> 4542.44
right there you go

4544.88 --> 4550.2390000000005
nuts art approach right that's just the

4547.82 --> 4550.239
imagery

4550.58 --> 4556.48
without Fe peeps I have pineapple of

4553.1 --> 4556.4800000000005
course if you order that

4560.36 --> 4566.839999999999
right but it's just it would just be

4562.88 --> 4568.76
regular pizza right or if if I had a

4566.84 --> 4572.54
grip on it if I had control I'd say

4568.76 --> 4576.08
organic pizza or something right but

4572.54 --> 4579.92
it's not about the pizza it's just about

4576.08 --> 4582.98
you have a picture of a flat Earth map

4579.92 --> 4585.1990000000005
on the box that's it that's the thing

4582.98 --> 4587.36
that's like the difference it's just

4585.199 --> 4590.36
that it's that simple

4587.36 --> 4591.92
right nobody has to even know about Flat

4590.36 --> 4595.699
Earth necessarily

4591.92 --> 4598.64
that works makes the pizzas

4595.699 --> 4600.678999999999
right nobody has to talk about it it's

4598.64 --> 4603.52
just a sticker it could be that simple

4600.679 --> 4603.52
in operation

4612.28 --> 4618.46
Flat Earth fortune cookies

4615.08 --> 4618.46
oh goody is

4619.659 --> 4623.139999999999
oh [ __ ]

4623.3 --> 4628.52
that's actually really funny

4625.76 --> 4630.26
letters fortune cookies

4628.52 --> 4632.96
it's gonna trigger a whole bunch of

4630.26 --> 4637.159000000001
people of course since the origin of

4632.96 --> 4637.159
that thing but

4637.76 --> 4643.360000000001
yeah

4639.08 --> 4643.36
just short sentences I mean

4643.46 --> 4648.02
it's a really funny place to basically

4645.8 --> 4651.38
put

4648.02 --> 4653.540000000001
just typical Flat Earth comments like or

4651.38 --> 4655.04
flat smack Associated comments it's just

4653.54 --> 4656.88
smartly written

4655.04 --> 4659.97
on those fortune cookies

4656.88 --> 4659.97
[Music]

4664.94 --> 4669.82
it's like flat smacking fortune cookies

4669.92 --> 4677.0
but but don't make it savonier Style

4674.179 --> 4680.3
can you can't handle the truth I like

4677.0 --> 4682.64
you don't want a piece of paper out of a

4680.3 --> 4684.8
fortune cake cookie that says you can't

4682.64 --> 4687.9800000000005
handle the truth

4684.8 --> 4692.5
right that's

4687.98 --> 4692.5
yeah that would just be kind of annoying

4711.64 --> 4715.96
all right Alicia interesting

4717.08 --> 4721.88
yep

4718.94 --> 4724.5199999999995
they give you that crazy look right at

4721.88 --> 4726.88
first because why they're probably

4724.52 --> 4729.8
expecting you to start blabbing

4726.88 --> 4731.900000000001
blabbering like a complete

4729.8 --> 4734.719
like degenerate [ __ ] or something

4731.9 --> 4736.58
because there are those videos uh like

4734.719 --> 4738.679
have you ever have you guys ever like

4736.58 --> 4739.76
watched around not flat Earth debate

4738.679 --> 4742.04
related

4739.76 --> 4744.4400000000005
there's like channels out there that are

4742.04 --> 4746.9
like oh yeah we're going to have a flat

4744.44 --> 4749.96
earther on today and they literally have

4746.9 --> 4752.659
a guy that's just acting like he's

4749.96 --> 4753.7390000000005
[ __ ] like he isn't even I could see

4752.659 --> 4756.62
that like

4753.739 --> 4759.379999999999
and just be like oh the kind of they act

4756.62 --> 4762.26
like a drugged out [ __ ] and they like

4759.38 --> 4765.86
give arguments

4762.26 --> 4768.5
that aren't even like closely up to date

4765.86 --> 4772.04
that like what an informed letter

4768.5 --> 4774.219
there's would say like in 2015 is what

4772.04 --> 4778.64
they're gonna talk about like completely

4774.219 --> 4781.34
ridiculous like worse than PJ level and

4778.64 --> 4782.96
Peach head by the way sorry BJ BJ these

4781.34 --> 4786.02
days is a lot better

4782.96 --> 4788.659
but just like talking complete

4786.02 --> 4791.3
dumb nonsense

4788.659 --> 4793.099999999999
there's that out there so people that

4791.3 --> 4794.78
might be like oh flutter it's still a

4793.1 --> 4797.120000000001
thing and they're just never seen it

4794.78 --> 4799.699
before they might click oh what's gonna

4797.12 --> 4802.04
happen they will probably typically see

4799.699 --> 4804.32
some video of like oh this guy oh we got

4802.04 --> 4808.4
a flat earther on today and then it's a

4804.32 --> 4810.799999999999
complete actor [ __ ] that says no

4808.4 --> 4813.44
arguments that make any sense about Flat

4810.8 --> 4815.42
Earth right so of course the first

4813.44 --> 4816.919999999999
reaction from a lot of people when you

4815.42 --> 4820.159
start about talking about Flat Earth

4816.92 --> 4822.5
will be like oh [ __ ] is this gonna be

4820.159 --> 4825.44
one of those cookie retards do I have a

4822.5 --> 4827.42
like a movie style conspiracy theorist

4825.44 --> 4829.699
on my hand that's a natural reaction

4827.42 --> 4831.7390000000005
because of all that right

4829.699 --> 4834.799999999999
if you then

4831.739 --> 4838.218999999999
instead start to talk really precisely

4834.8 --> 4840.02
and eloquently like with frequency and

4838.219 --> 4844.2390000000005
energy levels like

4840.02 --> 4848.360000000001
classic BBC presenter like really good

4844.239 --> 4851.78
vernacular good way of using your voice

4848.36 --> 4854.839999999999
and your tone very sharp

4851.78 --> 4857.239
right all that good energy then that

4854.84 --> 4859.76
will absolutely turn around they will go

4857.239 --> 4860.9
from oh [ __ ] because they're expecting a

4859.76 --> 4864.02
[ __ ]

4860.9 --> 4866.179
to like holy [ __ ] what did I get myself

4864.02 --> 4868.580000000001
into

4866.179 --> 4870.4400000000005
like people then sometimes get the

4868.58 --> 4873.139
feeling like did I just walk into

4870.44 --> 4875.239
another Universe did a parallel

4873.139 --> 4877.219
Dimension just open and like because

4875.239 --> 4879.5
everything about this sounds real but

4877.219 --> 4882.9800000000005
that's absolutely nothing I ever

4879.5 --> 4885.02
expected and I might feel like

4882.98 --> 4887.959999999999
okay

4885.02 --> 4890.06
like a bit nervous and [ __ ] right that's

4887.96 --> 4893.179
what's gonna happen then if you actually

4890.06 --> 4895.34
explain it sophisticated and not like

4893.179 --> 4899.2390000000005
what they would expect

4895.34 --> 4901.400000000001
some actor supposed flatter talking like

4899.239 --> 4904.459999999999
a complete [ __ ] that's what most

4901.4 --> 4906.62
people would expect when they like

4904.46 --> 4908.78
barely heard about it

4906.62 --> 4910.82
because that's the videos that will pop

4908.78 --> 4913.5199999999995
up when you search and you're like

4910.82 --> 4915.94
completely unexpected and unsuspecting

4913.52 --> 4915.9400000000005
newbie

4917.06 --> 4921.219
right so that's the face

4923.6 --> 4928.6
your face is ugly so the what the hell

4938.42 --> 4942.88
yes pgcnet gets it

4957.139 --> 4959.8
what

4984.5 --> 4987.04
foreign

4991.94 --> 4997.78
dude who are you why are you talking

4995.179 --> 4997.78
Dutch

5034.659 --> 5037.62
okay

5038.08 --> 5041.34
oh goody

5043.3 --> 5049.0
don't bend I will listen dude I'm just

5046.42 --> 5052.659
trying to figure out who you are I it's

5049.0 --> 5055.239
not like I'm like oh XXX that's

5052.659 --> 5059.0199999999995
I know what that also stands for I don't

5055.239 --> 5061.839999999999
I don't like it yeah I feel like you

5059.02 --> 5064.540000000001
might just be a troll again

5061.84 --> 5066.78
or some guy that just can't help but do

5064.54 --> 5066.78
that

5070.12 --> 5076.179
like why why don't you just use a name

5074.26 --> 5078.96
why does it have to reference to

5076.179 --> 5078.96
something like that

5080.86 --> 5085.12
yeah

5082.12 --> 5087.099999999999
derp alert potentially but he is like at

5085.12 --> 5089.5
least just saying normal things it's

5087.1 --> 5093.06
just like why do you have to pick a name

5089.5 --> 5093.06
like that again why

5103.179 --> 5107.58
what the best movie ever what do you

5105.46 --> 5107.58
mean

5128.199 --> 5133.199
best movie ever

5130.42 --> 5136.92
excuse me right back

5133.199 --> 5136.919999999999
I disagree

5138.82 --> 5143.0199999999995
and I freaking saw that thing in movie

5141.219 --> 5146.02
theaters

5143.02 --> 5149.860000000001
I thought it sucked

5146.02 --> 5150.88
like it it sucked I didn't like it at

5149.86 --> 5153.4
all

5150.88 --> 5158.28
I thought it was gross

5153.4 --> 5158.28
a moral and like just

5170.32 --> 5175.5599999999995
you did like Vin Diesel yeah but you're

5173.32 --> 5179.28
a woman so

5175.56 --> 5179.280000000001
just kidding

5182.8 --> 5186.84
yeah but

5184.36 --> 5186.839999999999
no

5194.5 --> 5199.3
yes yeah I'm slow-mo movie I know Matt

5197.44 --> 5202.659
from Quantum conscious did a reveal

5199.3 --> 5205.719
about it and it was interesting I agree

5202.659 --> 5208.0599999999995
but I also watched the movie a long time

5205.719 --> 5210.88
ago live

5208.06 --> 5213.52
and I just really thought it sucked like

5210.88 --> 5216.04
it made me sick you understand like it

5213.52 --> 5218.620000000001
made me sick in my stomach

5216.04 --> 5220.92
sitting through that like that's not a

5218.62 --> 5220.92
good thing

5222.28 --> 5225.96
like I did not have like afterward like

5224.739 --> 5229.12
yeah

5225.96 --> 5232.2390000000005
no it just made me sick when it was over

5229.12 --> 5234.599999999999
I was glad it was over okay that's not a

5232.239 --> 5234.599999999999
good sign

5248.139 --> 5250.8
foreign

5252.58 --> 5255.58
probably

5261.49 --> 5266.3189999999995
[Music]

5284.08 --> 5286.32
foreign

5290.46 --> 5295.9
306 I I think not I think RV probably

5293.62 --> 5297.34
has a very compartmentalized type of

5295.9 --> 5298.719
life

5297.34 --> 5301.0
I mean

5298.719 --> 5303.639
there's a great likelihood with the way

5301.0 --> 5306.3
he's been composing himself

5303.639 --> 5310.179
that he doesn't want people to actually

5306.3 --> 5312.76
recognize his internet Persona in the

5310.179 --> 5314.86
real world if you know what I mean yeah

5312.76 --> 5317.679
why he's never shown a picture of

5314.86 --> 5322.0
himself as a good reason

5317.679 --> 5325.06
because he is a complete savanye and he

5322.0 --> 5327.76
attacks everybody unreasonably so he

5325.06 --> 5331.0
probably wouldn't in the real world like

5327.76 --> 5333.280000000001
act like that to people because then he

5331.0 --> 5335.76
would become identified and then he has

5333.28 --> 5335.759999999999
a problem

5340.3 --> 5346.12
because I bet he's not made a great deal

5343.719 --> 5348.639
a great amount of friends

5346.12 --> 5351.46
I mean followers sure but like people

5463.6 --> 5469.8
will just ban you just by default

Steven's cat is a spy in the shell

5501.58 --> 5508.54
uh

5504.159 --> 5511.239
well yeah cats are spies definitely

5508.54 --> 5513.04
but they basically only Shield to their

5511.239 --> 5515.459999999999
provider so

5513.04 --> 5515.46
right

5527.56 --> 5531.42
consider changing my background

5532.12 --> 5537.88
sure but I like my background Miguel

5534.88 --> 5537.88
Barbosa

5544.6 --> 5548.139
but I have thought of like slightly

5546.76 --> 5549.58
modifying

5548.139 --> 5552.04
like

5549.58 --> 5554.98
the

5552.04 --> 5557.739
the design a bit

5554.98 --> 5559.99
maybe get myself a little bit more hand

5557.739 --> 5566.41
space you know what I mean

5559.99 --> 5566.41
[Music]

5574.48 --> 5583.5
yeah because about 40 of like the actual

webcam view is cut off

5583.96 --> 5590.219
from screen so

5586.78 --> 5590.219
I kind of want it back

5590.739 --> 5596.699

5635.02 --> 5642.219
to explain what he thought a shill is

5638.5 --> 5644.5
anybody ever like

5642.219 --> 5648.96
on record

5644.5 --> 5648.96
asked him that and that he explained it

5649.6 --> 5652.9800000000005
and if he did did he explain it

5651.88 --> 5656.09
correctly

[Music]

5681.88 --> 5686.82
we don't care he defines people chivalry

5687.159 --> 5693.4
yeah I that's interesting that you'd say

5689.739 --> 5694.659
that it kind of does doesn't he

5693.4 --> 5697.42
right

5694.659 --> 5700.679
but he'll it's like

5697.42 --> 5700.679
he'll judge people

5700.78 --> 5707.139
purely on on basically the rose colored

5704.679 --> 5709.8
Darkly that he's looking through at them

5707.139 --> 5709.8
at the time

5710.08 --> 5715.42
it's like hyper impulsive

5713.98 --> 5718.839999999999
and it's like

5715.42 --> 5720.88
yeah to me that seems like a basically a

5718.84 --> 5723.400000000001
soft psychotic trait where you don't

5720.88 --> 5725.08
actually realize

5723.4 --> 5727.179
what you're doing

5725.08 --> 5729.28
because you're so driven by your

5727.179 --> 5731.26
feelings

5729.28 --> 5734.0199999999995
that you're just that you're basically

5731.26 --> 5736.900000000001
your feelings are abusing your intellect

5734.02 --> 5739.179
of whatever range you have with that

5736.9 --> 5741.759999999999
or whatever you're doing

5739.179 --> 5743.9800000000005
he seems like that type that just does

5741.76 --> 5746.159000000001
not really have impulse control like

5743.98 --> 5746.159
that

5748.06 --> 5753.1
and that is like a soft psychotic trait

5750.88 --> 5755.46
because you literally don't know what

5753.1 --> 5755.46
you're doing

5755.739 --> 5759.58
their emotions are going to Blind you

5758.139 --> 5764.139
for that

5759.58 --> 5766.0
so people are going to be stuck to the

5764.139 --> 5768.88
the grills

5766.0 --> 5771.54
of your feelings

5768.88 --> 5775.26

5783.159 --> 5787.839999999999
taken too far with paranoia well he just

5786.04 --> 5790.86
courted himself

5787.84 --> 5793.78
right and then yeah you can just like oh

5790.86 --> 5796.54
everybody's after me oh yeah that's

5793.78 --> 5798.28
basically making yourself crazy to

5796.54 --> 5801.159
prevent

5798.28 --> 5804.48
letting it sink in how much you're

5801.159 --> 5808.299999999999
actually being publicly humiliated yeah

5804.48 --> 5810.339999999999
paranoia has a great mask you can put

5808.3 --> 5812.9800000000005
over that to fool yourself like

5810.34 --> 5815.02
everybody's attacking me no you just got

5812.98 --> 5817.178999999999
[ __ ] humiliated you don't have

5815.02 --> 5819.159000000001
control over yourself and you're not

5817.179 --> 5821.86
willing to admit it so you're going to

5819.159 --> 5824.339999999999
be other after me yeah that's weakness

5821.86 --> 5827.32
that's literally you deluding yourself

5824.34 --> 5829.0
to get through the moment

5827.32 --> 5832.44
that's okay

5829.0 --> 5832.44
a lot of people have that

5845.199 --> 5851.32
right but he is playing a packing game

5848.26 --> 5853.2390000000005
socially and it's stupid it's always

5851.32 --> 5855.78
like who's the next in the pecking order

5853.239 --> 5855.78
right

5856.48 --> 5859.678999999999
I don't like that

5860.8 --> 5867.4800000000005
I'm not a chicken I'm more like a

5864.34 --> 5867.4800000000005
a goose guy

5868.0 --> 5872.32
or a swan if you will

5871.06 --> 5875.02
yeah

5872.32 --> 5877.38
more Goose because they like the hanging

5875.02 --> 5877.38
groups

5877.54 --> 5882.28
and they don't take [ __ ]

5879.82 --> 5884.32
like you don't walk

5882.28 --> 5886.0599999999995
towards a goose and they're gonna go to

5884.32 --> 5888.099999999999
the side they're gonna be like oh really

5886.06 --> 5891.280000000001
oh really

5888.1 --> 5895.659000000001
no you walk around me or I might give

5891.28 --> 5895.659
you a smack with my beak oh

5904.06 --> 5908.26
yeah that I'm not about pecking order

5906.04 --> 5911.92
and geese aren't about pecking order

5908.26 --> 5914.58
they're just they're flocks

5911.92 --> 5914.58
they don't

5914.8 --> 5919.06
act like chicken stressed out chickens

5917.139 --> 5922.36
because stressed out chickens I I

5919.06 --> 5923.619000000001
believe I've never really close studied

5922.36 --> 5925.96
it

5923.619 --> 5927.88
from what I've heard chickens especially

5925.96 --> 5929.679
when they're not doing great they really

5927.88 --> 5931.96
start to have like pecking order things

5929.679 --> 5934.119
and if you have like multiple

5931.96 --> 5939.06
roosters

5934.119 --> 5939.0599999999995
then that becomes even more

5952.96 --> 5959.02
always want ah slow-mo moon buggy is so

5957.46 --> 5962.5
lucky

5959.02 --> 5965.92
uh I because I do actually want to hug

5962.5 --> 5969.3
the geese they're so cute it's just that

5965.92 --> 5969.3
they don't really like that

5969.82 --> 5976.44
you actually had one that would allow

5971.98 --> 5976.44
people to hug that's so amazing

5982.659 --> 5989.99
that is genuinely adorable

5996.46 --> 5998.46

6008.58 --> 6014.34
now does he remember him talking to

6011.52 --> 6016.7390000000005
Alice Joseph so yeah yeah yeah

6014.34 --> 6019.26
I remember it

6016.739 --> 6023.0
I remember it

6019.26 --> 6023.0
that's so hysterical

6025.679 --> 6030.54
yeah

6027.0 --> 6033.119
but I think I genuinely think based on

6030.54 --> 6036.9
everything that's happened it's it's not

6033.119 --> 6040.739
even like oh no that means evil not

6036.9 --> 6043.5
I think that RV kind of is a shield like

6040.739 --> 6046.5
the actual technical show I think he is

6043.5 --> 6049.5
probably like

6046.5 --> 6051.659
information placement in the conspiracy

6049.5 --> 6055.619
sector he might very well be connected

6051.659 --> 6057.299999999999
to like Freemason people or something

6055.619 --> 6061.32
right

6057.3 --> 6063.719
and he's just he's not allowing himself

6061.32 --> 6066.38
to even realize that that's what he's

6063.719 --> 6066.38
actually doing

6067.139 --> 6072.679
right so instead he just projects it

6069.719 --> 6072.679
onto everybody else

6073.679 --> 6078.3
is astral projection a real thing

6076.98 --> 6080.099999999999
sure

6078.3 --> 6081.2390000000005
that's not the projection that I was

6080.1 --> 6084.92
talking about though I'm talking about

6081.239 --> 6084.919999999999
psychological projection now

6091.44 --> 6093.98
huh

6100.32 --> 6104.58
check the phone if one finds a bug or

6102.719 --> 6106.7390000000005
something they all come over to invest

6104.58 --> 6108.0
yeah yeah yeah they do they're curious

6106.739 --> 6110.28
aren't they

6108.0 --> 6111.78
like oh what's happening oh something

6110.28 --> 6116.119
new

6111.78 --> 6116.119
like chickens are all about the gossip

6162.36 --> 6168.839999999999
right but in a way it's weird because

6165.659 --> 6171.299999999999
I'm starting to entertain the thought

6168.84 --> 6174.08
that maybe

6171.3 --> 6176.639
like the entire

6174.08 --> 6179.4
media Legacy

6176.639 --> 6180.6
supposed right wing it's all getting so

6179.4 --> 6183.719
fuzzy

6180.6 --> 6186.0
but that they're all kind of chills

6183.719 --> 6188.04
and that's not even necessarily a bad

6186.0 --> 6192.619
thing it's just like a modus operandi

6188.04 --> 6192.619
it's like how do they do their thing

6193.199 --> 6198.419999999999
it's just like no it's it's business

6195.36 --> 6200.219
it's information business and sometimes

6198.42 --> 6202.02
they pull things in that they're kind of

6200.219 --> 6204.659
off

6202.02 --> 6207.9800000000005
to keep it fresh

6204.659 --> 6207.98
and they make mistakes

6209.28 --> 6215.82
and they're still like reinforcing like

6212.82 --> 6218.82
Beast convictions like bad things right

6215.82 --> 6223.139
oh there's all this supposed right wing

6218.82 --> 6224.219
is it's all super super pro gay for

6223.139 --> 6227.1
example

6224.219 --> 6229.8
yeah oh no it's not super pro gay

6227.1 --> 6231.780000000001
because they're not shoving [ __ ] in

6229.8 --> 6234.06
your face or so

6231.78 --> 6238.88
except

6234.06 --> 6241.619000000001
it does do that indirectly and is like

6238.88 --> 6243.96
hyper apology oh we're not against this

6241.619 --> 6245.04
oh look we have a gay oh look we have

6243.96 --> 6248.82
this

6245.04 --> 6251.34
we have that we're all so fine with it

6248.82 --> 6254.0
right that is just like yeah they're

6251.34 --> 6254.0
super gay

6254.34 --> 6258.06
most of them like all these icons

6256.679 --> 6260.88
supposedly

6258.06 --> 6264.3
resonating with the right wing

6260.88 --> 6267.26
supposedly right why are they all so

6264.3 --> 6267.26
freaking gay

6272.04 --> 6274.88
why

6281.34 --> 6287.6990000000005
is this like a forced conversion to just

6284.88 --> 6289.9800000000005
like ah look at these insane Maniacs

6287.699 --> 6292.739
they're super gay

6289.98 --> 6295.138999999999
oh okay we're the good side though we're

6292.739 --> 6298.379999999999
against all those crazy Maniacs we're

6295.139 --> 6301.08
only moderately gay and you will be too

6298.38 --> 6303.4800000000005
right you have no choice but to become

6301.08 --> 6306.54
gay is is that what's going on is this

6303.48 --> 6308.82
like a gay Revolution is this like

6306.54 --> 6310.86
everybody is becoming gay it's

6308.82 --> 6314.58
normalized now it's like everybody has

6310.86 --> 6318.42
to have some kind of a gay trade somehow

6314.58 --> 6321.54
or you won't get money you won't get

6318.42 --> 6323.52
there they don't allow it it's like you

6321.54 --> 6326.159
have to be gay

6323.52 --> 6327.719
you don't have to even admit it you have

6326.159 --> 6329.638999999999
to somehow

6327.719 --> 6331.56
prove

6329.639 --> 6335.3
that you're gay

6331.56 --> 6335.3
or you won't get in

6339.9 --> 6345.08
it's

6341.58 --> 6349.08
I cannot express

6345.08 --> 6352.4
how incredibly gross I think that that

6349.08 --> 6352.4
entire situation is

6354.06 --> 6359.820000000001
it's so gross I'm almost like hey let's

6356.34 --> 6361.92
let's actually revive the left

6359.82 --> 6364.44
and actually make a real left which

6361.92 --> 6367.8
would be neutral

6364.44 --> 6371.239
and just say like yeah how about no gay

6367.8 --> 6371.2390000000005
like at all

6372.78 --> 6379.739
yeah put it back in the closet

6376.199 --> 6383.839999999999
and lock it we don't want it keep the

6379.739 --> 6383.839999999999
freaking gay to yourself yeah

6385.02 --> 6390.540000000001
how about that like have a liberal

6388.56 --> 6394.619000000001
perspective

6390.54 --> 6396.78
from the 50s

6394.619 --> 6399.299999999999
that was what liberals were saying in

6396.78 --> 6401.159
the 50s I think

6399.3 --> 6403.139
right

6401.159 --> 6405.719
well that's a pretty good stance to have

6403.139 --> 6408.3
right now she's like yeah

6405.719 --> 6411.119
no public not in public not in

6408.3 --> 6413.400000000001
advertisements not in anything not in

6411.119 --> 6416.699
books not in schools

6413.4 --> 6419.699
yeah you want that [ __ ]

6416.699 --> 6423.5
you're gonna have to seek it out and

6419.699 --> 6423.5
you're gonna have to keep it private

6424.679 --> 6429.86
now that's a stance that I could get

6427.44 --> 6429.86
behind

6432.6 --> 6439.139
careful you get banned from Rock yeah

6434.82 --> 6442.639
but rockfin is gay I don't want rockfin

6439.139 --> 6445.56
I halfway considered at some point like

6442.639 --> 6447.96
maybe I should look into if it's worth

6445.56 --> 6451.320000000001
getting into this then

6447.96 --> 6453.179
oh and Benjamin happened and that's

6451.32 --> 6454.44
immediately where everything fell into

6453.179 --> 6456.719
place and they're like yeah they're

6454.44 --> 6459.419999999999
freaking gay that's why it felt so off

6456.719 --> 6462.3
they're gay as [ __ ]

6459.42 --> 6463.56
I'm not going to have a Channel or

6462.3 --> 6467.219
rockfin

6463.56 --> 6471.719
because I am openly homophobic

6467.219 --> 6474.7390000000005
and I can actually build that argument

6471.719 --> 6474.7390000000005
about why

6475.52 --> 6484.5
not that I like it's not like I want to

6480.199 --> 6486.178999999999
erodicate or homosexual no no I'll just

6484.5 --> 6490.08
let the world do that when the time

6486.179 --> 6493.139
comes okay I don't want that I just want

6490.08 --> 6495.42
them to leave me alone and everybody I

6493.139 --> 6497.82
want gay people to just leave everybody

6495.42 --> 6500.159
alone with their gayness

6497.82 --> 6502.38
keep it to yourself

6500.159 --> 6504.599999999999
and then I really want mine if you just

6502.38 --> 6507.659000000001
kept it to yourself I'd be a very happy

6504.6 --> 6511.1990000000005
person and I'd be like yeah I like that

6507.659 --> 6513.48
guys our gays are great because we don't

6511.199 --> 6516.299999999999
even know they're gay

6513.48 --> 6518.58
or if we do they're not acting gay

6516.3 --> 6522.54
they're like really awesome people or

6518.58 --> 6524.58
Dependable creative and we don't have to

6522.54 --> 6525.96
know about the dirty little things they

6524.58 --> 6527.699
do in their bedroom

6525.96 --> 6530.28
because they don't tell us they don't

6527.699 --> 6533.219
push it in our face and I'm like yeah we

6530.28 --> 6535.259999999999
love these [ __ ] gays they know how to

6533.219 --> 6537.179
keep it secret that's what we want

6535.26 --> 6540.6
that's epic yeah

6537.179 --> 6543.78
we don't want to talk about how epic

6540.6 --> 6546.54
gays are all day though

6543.78 --> 6549.0599999999995
but if it comes up yeah sure I'll be

6546.54 --> 6551.34
like yeah our gays are epic because we

6549.06 --> 6554.42
don't know they're gay

6551.34 --> 6554.42
and that's great

6560.4 --> 6566.759999999999
that's right

6561.96 --> 6570.56
Putin was right and he is still right

6566.76 --> 6570.56
and he is going to win this war

6575.96 --> 6579.109
[Music]

I mean it's your freaking choice

6723.199 --> 6731.419999999999
goodness runs naturally in most animals

6727.32 --> 6731.42
that they don't have gay Prides though

6733.08 --> 6735.679
right

6736.139 --> 6744.3
and besides yeah I don't give a [ __ ] I

6741.0 --> 6747.06
don't give a [ __ ] what animals do

6744.3 --> 6750.4800000000005
when it comes to that yeah

6747.06 --> 6752.639
I mean animals also some eat their

6750.48 --> 6754.919999999999
babies does that mean that it's like oh

6752.639 --> 6758.42
well if animals eat their babies I mean

6754.92 --> 6762.92
yeah it's all natural right oh

6758.42 --> 6762.92
no I don't give a [ __ ]

6773.159 --> 6775.82
foreign

6777.43 --> 6780.629
[Music]

6797.06 --> 6804.4400000000005
oh nasty nasty yeah well get the [ __ ]

6801.96 --> 6804.44
out then

6804.78 --> 6806.96
foreign

6813.78 --> 6820.32
or I'm not sorry it's that's

6816.84 --> 6822.78
yeah bad habit

6820.32 --> 6825.44
that's what I am this is how I am this

6822.78 --> 6825.44
is my rules

6825.48 --> 6832.44
if you don't like it get the [ __ ] out

6828.78 --> 6836.699
if you go go watch your gay pride videos

6832.44 --> 6839.82
or whatever I don't give a [ __ ]

6836.699 --> 6842.5199999999995
don't care for your opinion flag the

6839.82 --> 6844.98
[ __ ] out of me because I do this all the

6842.52 --> 6846.179
time and I'm very Unapologetic about it

6844.98 --> 6851.28
yeah

6846.179 --> 6855.84
I have a very strong opinion about gay

6851.28 --> 6858.0199999999995
and I will express it unabated do you

6855.84 --> 6858.02
understand

6863.28 --> 6870.0
yeah and and there's even details to

6866.34 --> 6873.2390000000005
this if you care but you don't

6870.0 --> 6877.02
right because for example I have less

6873.239 --> 6881.119
problems with people that are trans

6877.02 --> 6881.119000000001
than people that are overtly gay

6882.36 --> 6887.4
because to me it's about the sexuality

6885.3 --> 6890.9400000000005
of it

6887.4 --> 6893.28
right that's what is what grosses me out

6890.94 --> 6896.4
so much

6893.28 --> 6899.159
with actual gays well a lot of trans

6896.4 --> 6901.46
people aren't necessarily like sexual

6899.159 --> 6904.32
deviants I mean

6901.46 --> 6906.119
there's some out there that are like not

6904.32 --> 6908.34
even making effort they're just like oh

6906.119 --> 6909.54
they just put up makeup and still with

6908.34 --> 6912.54
their beard and they still have to feed

6909.54 --> 6915.3
us like I'm a woman now yeah that's

6912.54 --> 6921.0
that's not to me a trans person that's

6915.3 --> 6924.599
just a deranged groomer gross person

6921.0 --> 6926.4
I I would not respect I would not be

6924.599 --> 6930.42
able to like communicate with them but

6926.4 --> 6933.42
I've met actual trans people

6930.42 --> 6936.179
that were like that kind of were like

6933.42 --> 6937.7390000000005
that they weren't really sexual and it

6936.179 --> 6941.159
could communicate with them it could

6937.739 --> 6943.138999999999
even like get

6941.159 --> 6947.339999999999
their persona

6943.139 --> 6951.96
it's okay right it's like Brenda is

6947.34 --> 6954.179
trans very trans probably very ugly I

6951.96 --> 6957.3
don't care I have no problem with that

6954.179 --> 6958.619
whatsoever I had a re I had a like

6957.3 --> 6961.7390000000005
early

6958.619 --> 6966.0
what is it 70s operation

6961.739 --> 6970.32
trans friend for years that I called

6966.0 --> 6971.639
with because why because you formally he

6970.32 --> 6974.94
she

6971.639 --> 6977.219
a librarian knows a lot they had a lot

6974.94 --> 6979.259999999999
of books read a lot of philosophy was

6977.219 --> 6983.46
great having conversations with her and

6979.26 --> 6983.46
have absolutely no problem seeing

6983.52 --> 6990.3
her as a her

6986.4 --> 6993.598999999999
right and she wasn't sexual at all

6990.3 --> 6995.76
and I wasn't attracted I have met her in

6993.599 --> 6997.8
person went to parties the gothic

6995.76 --> 6998.9400000000005
parties and [ __ ] great it was a great

6997.8 --> 7002.06
friend

6998.94 --> 7006.339999999999
until basically

7002.06 --> 7006.34
and that happened like two years ago now

7006.44 --> 7014.299999999999
she became intolerant of my latterth

7009.739 --> 7018.879999999999
convictions and turned into a violent

7014.3 --> 7018.88
verbally violent anti-flat earther

7019.099 --> 7025.82
she would basically reflect

7022.9 --> 7027.86
responses from other people probably

7025.82 --> 7030.08
teachers and all that

7027.86 --> 7033.199
and she just like absolutely

7030.08 --> 7035.54
unacceptable and and then suddenly when

7033.199 --> 7037.098999999999
that happened also my other opinion

7035.54 --> 7039.8
suddenly she wouldn't be able to

7037.099 --> 7043.54
tolerate them anymore now either

7039.8 --> 7047.2390000000005
like what you're Pro Putin how dare you

7043.54 --> 7049.159
he went after homosexuals right

7047.239 --> 7051.799999999999
I'm like yeah yeah I know that's kind of

7049.159 --> 7054.44
your group isn't it yeah

7051.8 --> 7056.179
but I have these opinions and I will

7054.44 --> 7058.4
absolutely not hold against that

7056.179 --> 7061.099
personally to you

7058.4 --> 7064.48
but I'm not going to apologize and I

7061.099 --> 7067.03
will absolutely no matter the cost

7064.48 --> 7068.299999999999
retract my position

7067.03 --> 7069.5599999999995
[Music]

7068.3 --> 7073.28
and

7069.56 --> 7075.080000000001
then she was insulted and that didn't

7073.28 --> 7077.96
change

7075.08 --> 7080.78
like I just left it for a bit then tried

7077.96 --> 7083.4800000000005
to like text her back after what is it

7080.78 --> 7085.219
months and she was like no I I don't

7083.48 --> 7087.5
have anything to talk about with you

7085.219 --> 7090.619
anymore and even adult that person I've

7087.5 --> 7093.56
been communicating for like

7090.619 --> 7096.08
thousands of hours

7093.56 --> 7099.02
on a high level and still that happened

7096.08 --> 7101.3
I'm very sorry about that as in like

7099.02 --> 7103.159000000001
yeah I kind of like it was we had good

7101.3 --> 7104.78
times and it was very interesting it was

7103.159 --> 7107.98
very stimulating

7104.78 --> 7107.98
person to know

7108.02 --> 7113.179
but that happens

7110.54 --> 7116.9
right I have no problem with trans

7113.179 --> 7119.42
people unless they're just gays

7116.9 --> 7121.759999999999
that are always trying to they're just

7119.42 --> 7124.219
obsessed with gay sex and [ __ ] right

7121.76 --> 7128.56
then I have a problem with it I have a

7124.219 --> 7128.56
problem with that the sexual part

7131.06 --> 7133.84
that's it

7134.0 --> 7140.0
I have no problem with lesbians by the

7136.4 --> 7142.4
way although I don't like it when only

7140.0 --> 7143.9
women available are lesbians then it

7142.4 --> 7146.119
gets annoying

7143.9 --> 7147.259999999999
minutes

7146.119 --> 7148.82
but

7147.26 --> 7150.02
yeah

7148.82 --> 7152.0599999999995
so

7150.02 --> 7155.659000000001
very specific

7152.06 --> 7160.9400000000005
Brenda is trans you'll call it called it

7155.659 --> 7163.54
a her well why wouldn't you call her her

7160.94 --> 7163.54
I mean

7164.54 --> 7168.92
why not

7167.0 --> 7171.619
you're probably never even gonna see a

7168.92 --> 7174.58
picture of her that used to be him

7171.619 --> 7174.58
doesn't matter

7175.159 --> 7179.78
right are you come do you just want to

7177.56 --> 7181.46
disrupt that image constantly say no

7179.78 --> 7183.32
you're not a her you're not a herd

7181.46 --> 7185.84
that's just going to just annoy her it's

7183.32 --> 7189.82
not gonna yield a conversation

7185.84 --> 7189.82
you see so why would you do that

7195.38 --> 7201.08
trying to understand your view but I

7197.96 --> 7203.78
guess I'm not just not getting it

7201.08 --> 7206.679
all right Rick back well it's a bit of a

7203.78 --> 7206.679
sophisticated position

7209.3 --> 7213.8
it's just that

7211.699 --> 7216.44
I've grown up

7213.8 --> 7218.0
liberal

7216.44 --> 7219.86
with

7218.0 --> 7223.58
gay people

7219.86 --> 7226.759999999999
too like half my friends of my parents

7223.58 --> 7229.159
that came over were kind of gay one of

7226.76 --> 7232.219
those guys being gay

7229.159 --> 7233.25
is really awesome I think he was in love

7232.219 --> 7235.46
with me though

7233.25 --> 7238.46
[Music]

7235.46 --> 7241.639
not when I was like

7238.46 --> 7243.199
no Peto [ __ ] like that

7241.639 --> 7246.1990000000005
but

7243.199 --> 7249.32
yeah I've had gay people and as long as

7246.199 --> 7252.678999999999
they were just not trying to pick me up

7249.32 --> 7255.44
or manipulate me or do something gross

7252.679 --> 7258.139
to keep the gay to themselves I would

7255.44 --> 7262.4
think they're awesome

7258.139 --> 7266.02
right it's the homosexuality that is

7262.4 --> 7266.0199999999995
really the problem for me

7266.06 --> 7270.4400000000005
and of course there's like pragmatic

7268.52 --> 7272.719
issues that I have

7270.44 --> 7275.9
right pragmatic as you could call it

7272.719 --> 7278.179
political I don't want children to be

7275.9 --> 7281.86
indoctrinated with it

7278.179 --> 7284.78
right there's this very clear

7281.86 --> 7287.299999999999
border which should not be crossed and

7284.78 --> 7288.5599999999995
it has been crossed

7287.3 --> 7290.84
right

7288.56 --> 7294.56
like I don't think that children should

7290.84 --> 7298.54
even ever know it exists

7294.56 --> 7298.54
until they're like 12 or something

7299.3 --> 7305.06
right before that they should not even

7301.28 --> 7308.9
be ever having to face things like trans

7305.06 --> 7311.599
and gay pride and [ __ ] ever

7308.9 --> 7314.78
but hey after 12 I think like yeah

7311.599 --> 7317.0
that's okay to start

7314.78 --> 7318.86
confronting that right maybe they have

7317.0 --> 7321.139
some who knows

7318.86 --> 7323.239
right

7321.139 --> 7326.36
but not

7323.239 --> 7328.339999999999
little kids don't freaking do that

7326.36 --> 7332.0599999999995
little kids thing and like teach them

7328.34 --> 7335.3
about anal sex and that's so wrong it's

7332.06 --> 7337.719
like I hate that

7335.3 --> 7337.719
not

7341.9 --> 7345.159
it's just so wrong

7368.679 --> 7376.159
ew psych bear that's so gross

7373.219 --> 7379.54
to describe it like that

7376.159 --> 7379.54
yeah anyway

7385.159 --> 7389.54
that's right flutter says yeah that's my

7387.56 --> 7393.139
stance too

7389.54 --> 7395.06
right and it's also for my own safety in

7393.139 --> 7397.639
ways because

7395.06 --> 7401.119000000001
I'm kind of a hug person this sounds

7397.639 --> 7405.82
weird I really like that it it's because

7401.119 --> 7405.82
of my empathy that it does a lot for me

7406.94 --> 7412.94
I'm a hug person

7409.219 --> 7414.56
if well if it if it gets to hug a gay

7412.94 --> 7417.32
and then there's something like oh oh

7414.56 --> 7421.159000000001
you like it that's a nightmare to me

7417.32 --> 7423.799999999999
that's a nightmare to me okay

7421.159 --> 7425.839999999999
that I like want to hug somebody because

7423.8 --> 7428.96
I just like oh

7425.84 --> 7430.099
I love you bro and if they then took it

7428.96 --> 7432.32
sexually

7430.099 --> 7434.659000000001
and like made a pass on me or like cut

7432.32 --> 7436.099
my ad that is a nightmare to me okay

7434.659 --> 7438.32
that's

7436.099 --> 7440.360000000001
a terrible thing

7438.32 --> 7443.92
if that happened to me I would be like

7440.36 --> 7443.92
via I would feel violated

7444.26 --> 7446.7390000000005
right

7447.26 --> 7452.06
I want to live in a world where you

7449.239 --> 7456.28
could like hug a guy and then they that

7452.06 --> 7456.280000000001
they would never make a move on you

7456.86 --> 7460.659
that's the world that I want to live in

7465.32 --> 7470.48
but yeah I don't know if that's the

7468.079 --> 7471.5599999999995
world this is all turning into at this

7470.48 --> 7475.178999999999
point

7471.56 --> 7475.179
it seems like it isn't

7487.159 --> 7491.739
yeah flatter set it is super gross

7492.199 --> 7496.5199999999995
when they when they do that it is super

7494.3 --> 7499.52
gross it's just like somebody just

7496.52 --> 7502.88
playing porn on their mobile on speaker

7499.52 --> 7506.02
in public right it's super gross

[Music]

7507.56 --> 7509.7390000000005
foreign

7512.619 --> 7517.339999999999
like that in public like I think it's

7515.659 --> 7519.5
even gross when

7517.34 --> 7521.9800000000005
when it's heterosexual

7519.5 --> 7521.98
yeah

7534.86 --> 7539.139999999999
right and it's not because I don't like

7536.9 --> 7540.379999999999
sex by the way

7539.14 --> 7542.96
[Music]

7540.38 --> 7545.78
I'm just kind of like it more of a

7542.96 --> 7548.8
caveman person I just like

7545.78 --> 7548.8
not talking

7549.199 --> 7555.638999999999
like like we'll just do the

7552.02 --> 7555.639
communication telepathically

7557.3 --> 7562.04
I don't like sex talk

7560.06 --> 7565.119000000001
I don't like it

7562.04 --> 7565.119
grosses me out

7569.9 --> 7576.079
I mean unless yeah unless under very

7573.199 --> 7578.719
specific conditions if it is like woman

7576.079 --> 7580.219
talks dirty to you kind of to seduce you

7578.719 --> 7582.56
in the moment because you're kind of

7580.219 --> 7584.54
already having sex or whatever yeah okay

7582.56 --> 7586.820000000001
that's like

7584.54 --> 7590.36
that's where it starts to border like

7586.82 --> 7593.599
okay maybe it's that's okay right but

7590.36 --> 7595.04
if it's like just in public that's just

7593.599 --> 7598.119000000001
like what the [ __ ]

7595.04 --> 7598.119
that's so wrong

7603.02 --> 7609.1990000000005
you could almost say that basically

7604.94 --> 7612.259999999999
sexual talk is almost

7609.199 --> 7615.0199999999995
like having sex

7612.26 --> 7617.119000000001
it's kind of intimate so why would you

7615.02 --> 7620.3
do that in public like you can't

7617.119 --> 7622.759999999999
officially it's illegal to have sex in

7620.3 --> 7625.159000000001
public right somebody sees that they

7622.76 --> 7627.02
call the police you get arrested most

7625.159 --> 7629.48
countries

7627.02 --> 7631.9400000000005
right so why would you then be able to

7629.48 --> 7635.54
do something that is very much sexual

7631.94 --> 7637.94
that you would normally do in private

7635.54 --> 7639.619
seduce somebody with sexual toxic why

7637.94 --> 7642.138999999999
would you be allowed to do that in

7639.619 --> 7645.5199999999995
public then right that's kind of my

7642.139 --> 7645.52
point of view on that

7651.38 --> 7657.04
thanks for the compliment

7653.54 --> 7657.04
that's not my thing

7657.739 --> 7663.079
well if somebody is just like if a gay

7660.199 --> 7664.879999999999
would just happen to be making a move on

7663.079 --> 7667.639
me

7664.88 --> 7669.26
uh yeah sure I'd say that right I'm not

7667.639 --> 7671.119
going to be like hey get the [ __ ] off of

7669.26 --> 7672.8
me you homo or something I'm not like

7671.119 --> 7675.44
that

7672.8 --> 7677.599
it's still gonna gross me out I'm still

7675.44 --> 7679.759999999999
gonna have like issues with that

7677.599 --> 7681.9400000000005
afterward if that happened even though I

7679.76 --> 7681.9400000000005
can

7681.98 --> 7687.86
be very respectful

7684.44 --> 7690.5
in my dick declining it right

7687.86 --> 7693.5599999999995
it's still gonna gross me out afterwards

7690.5 --> 7695.54
like oh my God instead of just like

7693.56 --> 7697.46
remembering the moment where we were

7695.54 --> 7700.639
talking about the subject or whatever

7697.46 --> 7702.7390000000005
I'll remember like oh my God that's the

7700.639 --> 7705.679
time where that guy tried to make a move

7702.739 --> 7708.919999999999
on me it's gonna erase everything else

7705.679 --> 7712.099
because it really grosses me out even if

7708.92 --> 7714.139
I can keep my composure and be very

7712.099 --> 7717.82
polite in the moment it's still gonna

7714.139 --> 7717.82
ruin my day

7718.579 --> 7721.119
right

7723.24 --> 7726.59
[Music]

7728.599 --> 7733.719
first trans I saw was in The Hangover

7731.119 --> 7733.719
was

7740.659 --> 7745.339999999999
first trans I saw wasn't that really

7742.88 --> 7747.4400000000005
trans more like a transvestite

7745.34 --> 7749.78
I saw wasn't that

7747.44 --> 7752.0
crazy movie

7749.78 --> 7754.159
terrible news

7752.0 --> 7756.94
again

7754.159 --> 7756.94
uh

7758.599 --> 7762.159000000001
I don't even remember the name

7764.719 --> 7769.82
I think overall I've met more actual

7767.719 --> 7772.34
trans people face to face than I've

7769.82 --> 7775.659
bumped into them in movies

7772.34 --> 7775.659000000001
which is kind of weird

7782.239 --> 7787.579
right but it's it's it's all kind of

7784.88 --> 7790.76
weird and convoluted because

7787.579 --> 7792.98
trans really is like a reinvention in

7790.76 --> 7795.02
ways where they just weird it up even

7792.98 --> 7798.5599999999995
more because

7795.02 --> 7800.3
I mean guys dressed up like women and

7798.56 --> 7805.099
all that

7800.3 --> 7806.78
that's that's just a transvestite

7805.099 --> 7809.54
right

7806.78 --> 7813.139
or short a [ __ ]

7809.54 --> 7815.659
now it's like oh that's a trance or

7813.139 --> 7818.36
something but they can still they don't

7815.659 --> 7821.119
have to have their operation but they're

7818.36 --> 7823.699
still a trance that all makes no sense

7821.119 --> 7826.28
because hey if you're just dressed up

7823.699 --> 7827.78
like a woman or whatever with makeup and

7826.28 --> 7829.28
you're a guy and you still have your

7827.78 --> 7832.579
penis

7829.28 --> 7836.239
that's not trans that's not a woman

7832.579 --> 7838.639
that's a transvestite it makes no sense

7836.239 --> 7841.82
that it's something else than just a

7838.639 --> 7844.76
transvestite you see it makes no sense

7841.82 --> 7847.759999999999
and that's why all of it is become also

7844.76 --> 7851.5
convoluted and chaos

7847.76 --> 7851.5
it doesn't make any sense anymore

7863.659 --> 7866.259999999999
foreign

7872.599 --> 7880.78
gay person could never ruin my day short

7875.42 --> 7880.78
of physical violence okay good on you

7890.599 --> 7894.32
I guess it depends on the person you

7893.06 --> 7898.719
know

7894.32 --> 7898.719
and how much respect they have for you

7901.28 --> 7907.94
but yeah I I find that that sort of

7904.4 --> 7910.159
thing ruins my day it I'm yeah I keep

7907.94 --> 7914.36
saying I'm sorry but I'm I'm really not

7910.159 --> 7917.119
it's my natural system it's just if a

7914.36 --> 7918.619
group or whatever and I'm I'm going

7917.119 --> 7921.0199999999995
there for the group and it turns out

7918.619 --> 7926.0599999999995
that like almost half of them are like

7921.02 --> 7927.8
overtly gay I'm just going to leave

7926.06 --> 7930.7390000000005
that's what I do

7927.8 --> 7934.099
everybody's gay then that means they're

7930.739 --> 7937.0599999999995
all gonna be gay in whatever we do I

7934.099 --> 7937.06
don't want to do that

7939.44 --> 7946.04
yeah it's like for example d d groups

7943.52 --> 7948.8
dungeon dragons groups

7946.04 --> 7950.9
we had this thing before even the Flat

7948.8 --> 7953.06
Earth early bird show and all that where

7950.9 --> 7956.719
we came together and had several groups

7953.06 --> 7958.88
we did it through meetup.com

7956.719 --> 7961.699
and what a pretty big group we had like

7958.88 --> 7963.38
a hundreds of people at the end

7961.699 --> 7965.0599999999995
they're they've all kind of separated

7963.38 --> 7967.219
off and went on Facebook or whatever

7965.06 --> 7968.659000000001
they went their own ways but we had

7967.219 --> 7970.699
meetups where there would be like a

7968.659 --> 7972.679
hundred people sometimes

7970.699 --> 7975.739
right well

7972.679 --> 7978.1990000000005
some of them were kind of gay they kept

7975.739 --> 7979.82
it to themselves it was awesome like I

7978.199 --> 7981.739
knew they were keeping it to themselves

7979.82 --> 7983.48
like I could see it about them like that

7981.739 --> 7986.178999999999
guy's probably gay but he's keeping it

7983.48 --> 7988.098999999999
to himself so that's awesome

7986.179 --> 7990.92
right

7988.099 --> 7992.719
what if like those groups actually would

7990.92 --> 7994.9
be like oh it turns out that half of

7992.719 --> 7999.56
them were just like ah

7994.9 --> 8003.0599999999995
I'd be like oh my god get me out of here

7999.56 --> 8006.34
I don't want to be

8003.06 --> 8008.320000000001
mind-melding with people like that

8006.34 --> 8010.78
because then if they're in a majority

8008.32 --> 8012.82
then they think oh that means we can do

8010.78 --> 8015.699
the gay thing now

8012.82 --> 8019.599
right I don't want to adapt to that

8015.699 --> 8021.4
so thank God in my experiences like

8019.599 --> 8024.219
those years back with dungeon dragon

8021.4 --> 8026.5599999999995
groups that never happened

8024.219 --> 8031.719
right

8026.56 --> 8033.099
but we weirdly had more like just trans

8031.719 --> 8036.159
people

8033.099 --> 8039.04
like women that were

8036.159 --> 8041.44
becoming a man or men that were actually

8039.04 --> 8044.679
women

8041.44 --> 8047.86
with like you're pretty young

8044.679 --> 8050.4400000000005
right we had some of that but like they

8047.86 --> 8051.579
weren't sexual or anything so it was not

8050.44 --> 8054.4
disruptive

8051.579 --> 8056.44
I guess it was great it's almost so not

8054.4 --> 8060.638999999999
disruptive that it really helped the

8056.44 --> 8062.619
focus even better on the mind which is

8060.639 --> 8065.32
what you do when you play Dungeons and

8062.619 --> 8066.759999999999
Dragons tabletop

8065.32 --> 8069.219
right

8066.76 --> 8070.84
there's people constantly being sexual

8069.219 --> 8072.82
or like

8070.84 --> 8076.0
seductive or thinking about that

8072.82 --> 8077.739
constantly it's going to disrupt the

8076.0 --> 8080.02
flow

8077.739 --> 8083.379999999999
of the process of the dream that you're

8080.02 --> 8086.159000000001
sharing when you play the game

8083.38 --> 8086.159000000001
right anyway

8096.84 --> 8105.52
Prejudice ultimately just hurt you

8100.78 --> 8108.28
no I'm I'm I don't see it as prejudice

8105.52 --> 8111.84
this is my choice

8108.28 --> 8111.84
it's my personal preference

8114.94 --> 8120.638999999999
I'm homophobic

8117.34 --> 8122.079
and I'm going to stick up

8120.639 --> 8124.86
for that

8122.079 --> 8124.86
and that's it

8148.48 --> 8153.699
that's right

8151.0 --> 8155.679
tolerance but with them controlling

8153.699 --> 8158.678999999999
their behavior right it's a two-way

8155.679 --> 8158.679
respect

8164.739 --> 8169.0199999999995
now homophobic is not about

8169.06 --> 8175.4800000000005
in this case it's not literally a phobia

8171.88 --> 8177.9400000000005
I'm not afraid of them it's just that I

8175.48 --> 8179.28
find them extremely disruptive to my

8177.94 --> 8183.699
sensories

8179.28 --> 8185.079
invasive so on an instinctual level you

8183.699 --> 8188.138999999999
could say yeah

8185.079 --> 8191.619
it could become phobia

8188.139 --> 8193.059
like actual phobia if I was if yeah

8191.619 --> 8197.199999999999
I don't know I don't even want to

8193.059 --> 8197.199999999999
imagine that yuck but

8200.62 --> 8205.960000000001
I just know it's not good for me

8203.8 --> 8208.66
and I don't want it

8205.96 --> 8211.438999999998
and I don't want it to be normal

8208.66 --> 8211.439
that's it

8213.28 --> 8217.74
the term by itself is BS

8219.639 --> 8226.119999999999
well the original meaning of how it was

8223.54 --> 8229.660000000002
used with homophobia yeah is [ __ ]

8226.12 --> 8233.58
it's sjw talk I get it right

8229.66 --> 8233.58
it's an incorrect assessment

8234.46 --> 8237.039999999999
but

8235.479 --> 8241.0
as a word

8237.04 --> 8243.880000000001
people do get it that people that aren't

8241.0 --> 8245.859
just like overt accusers and all that

8243.88 --> 8248.018999999998
they still get it like yeah this guy

8245.859 --> 8250.54
just really doesn't like gays

8248.019 --> 8251.74
just it makes him uncomfortable

8250.54 --> 8253.12
right

8251.74 --> 8255.46
now that

8253.12 --> 8259.719000000001
that would be

8255.46 --> 8262.3
probably called homophobia

8259.719 --> 8265.199999999999
even though it's not technically phobia

8262.3 --> 8265.199999999999
right

8265.42 --> 8270.819
but yeah it is the best word that will

8268.359 --> 8273.519
be understood

8270.819 --> 8275.319
till you find a better word for it but

8273.519 --> 8277.319
yeah these words already spread around

8275.319 --> 8280.24
like wildfire

8277.319 --> 8282.099
through incorrect application and

8280.24 --> 8285.16
political persecution

8282.099 --> 8286.54
right that also means that the word has

8285.16 --> 8288.76
been out there that people will

8286.54 --> 8291.580000000002
recognize it and that what people will

8288.76 --> 8293.74
reflect upon it and try the size of what

8291.58 --> 8296.16
is this like what are these people

8293.74 --> 8296.16
really

8296.979 --> 8302.26
right so it will give the word and how

8300.34 --> 8304.960000000001
it's been applied and that spread around

8302.26 --> 8306.639000000001
will give a platform for understanding

8304.96 --> 8309.219
when I use it

8306.639 --> 8310.789999999999
fractal thinking

8309.219 --> 8314.639
see

8310.79 --> 8314.639000000001
[Music]

8316.96 --> 8322.899
yeah but it's okay that that picture is

8320.26 --> 8325.92
painted in their minds Godzilla it is

8322.899 --> 8328.358999999999
okay yeah because

8325.92 --> 8331.42
homophobics supposedly

8328.359 --> 8334.899000000001
allegedly have been persecuted and

8331.42 --> 8337.84
shamed and bullied a lot I've kind of

8334.899 --> 8340.96
managed to stay clear from that

8337.84 --> 8344.62
but it's only because I was from that

8340.96 --> 8347.139
contemporary moment lucky enough

8344.62 --> 8350.859
to grind and grow up in between gays so

8347.139 --> 8352.719
that I was able to handle that and not

8350.859 --> 8356.139000000001
be

8352.719 --> 8358.119999999999
like having more aggressive aggression

8356.139 --> 8359.319
situations because of that I've avoided

8358.12 --> 8361.92
that

8359.319 --> 8361.92
right

8367.24 --> 8372.939
so I want that picture to be painted

8369.76 --> 8374.679
because it is it happened that happened

8372.939 --> 8377.139000000001
yeah

8374.679 --> 8379.0
people that didn't want gays they don't

8377.139 --> 8380.858999999999
like them or even like really hate them

8379.0 --> 8381.88
and they don't recommend that but it

8380.859 --> 8385.42
happens

8381.88 --> 8387.96
they were persecuted shamed socially

8385.42 --> 8387.960000000001
like

8388.24 --> 8391.5
they weren't left alone

8396.28 --> 8401.319000000001
right I want people to be reminded about

8399.22 --> 8404.319
that that happened

8401.319 --> 8406.0
that in the mass hysteria programming it

8404.319 --> 8408.18
happened and a lot of people went with

8406.0 --> 8408.18
it

8408.819 --> 8413.199999999999
they'd pile on they did it themselves to

8411.7 --> 8416.220000000001
others

8413.2 --> 8416.220000000001
and it's terrible

8416.38 --> 8423.599999999999
like that's a personal

8419.1 --> 8423.6
atrocity to me that that happened

8423.64 --> 8428.8
it's it's almost to me personally like

8426.58 --> 8431.74
what a rollerblading incident would be

8428.8 --> 8435.759999999998
to a Jew

8431.74 --> 8439.72
right not probably not that dramatic but

8435.76 --> 8441.64
yeah it I take that like I hate that

8439.72 --> 8443.74
that happened like that was a personal

8441.64 --> 8445.599999999999
atrocity to me

8443.74 --> 8447.399
seeing that that was happening

8445.6 --> 8451.359
everywhere

8447.399 --> 8454.42
like you're not allowed to not lie gays

8451.359 --> 8456.7
that is a personal atrocity to me that

8454.42 --> 8458.8
that unfolded and I still remember when

8456.7 --> 8463.08
that happened it was around that [ __ ]

8458.8 --> 8465.759999999998
Obama that piece of [ __ ] Hitler

8463.08 --> 8470.46
blackface Hitler Obama

8465.76 --> 8470.460000000001
that's who who triggered that [ __ ]

8474.44 --> 8484.049
[Music]

8485.2 --> 8490.08
these are allowed to be married now and

8487.12 --> 8490.08
adopt kids yeah

8492.16 --> 8497.38
odd and risky

8495.399 --> 8500.68
I mean

8497.38 --> 8503.858999999999
I guess they're like passive gays or

8500.68 --> 8505.359
whatever not super over overtly sexual

8503.859 --> 8508.18
and gross

8505.359 --> 8511.6
or insane then I'd be like yeah okay

8508.18 --> 8514.720000000001
well as long as like there's checkups

8511.6 --> 8516.52
and all that and proper checkup with the

8514.72 --> 8520.0
child

8516.52 --> 8522.460000000001
and their psyche then maybe sort of

8520.0 --> 8524.8
under partial supervision but yeah then

8522.46 --> 8527.16
again like everybody could probably use

8524.8 --> 8527.16
that

8528.28 --> 8531.300000000001
a bit of help

8531.52 --> 8534.18
but

8541.18 --> 8547.18
it's just that the whole gay marriage

8543.34 --> 8550.26
thing is to me that doesn't really even

8547.18 --> 8550.26
hold that much weight

8551.62 --> 8556.6
I mean what is it really maybe you could

8554.56 --> 8558.939
say it's a tech scam or something right

8556.6 --> 8561.939
because it's like the marriage thing

8558.939 --> 8564.28
does have like taxation implications and

8561.939 --> 8566.02
all those types of thingies

8564.28 --> 8567.880000000001
so yeah

8566.02 --> 8570.58
but and

8567.88 --> 8573.938999999998
yeah to just like oh

8570.58 --> 8577.3
like push all these little kids towards

8573.939 --> 8581.28
gay couples for them to adopt is not

8577.3 --> 8581.279999999999
really a good idea either

8583.18 --> 8587.52
like especially to like push that

8587.8 --> 8591.099999999999
redundant

8589.42 --> 8594.399
gay marriage seems redundant well it's

8591.1 --> 8596.56
like a ritual and it is about like it is

8594.399 --> 8599.56
also about tax status and all that right

8596.56 --> 8602.22
you have to remember that

8599.56 --> 8602.22
foreign

8606.16 --> 8612.359
I don't like it

8608.859 --> 8612.359
I think it's embarrassing

8612.52 --> 8615.899000000001
but yeah

8619.66 --> 8625.96
I mean if a gay couple

8622.84 --> 8628.78
could be really decent parents that did

8625.96 --> 8631.479
everything really well

8628.78 --> 8634.18
and it really cared about their kid and

8631.479 --> 8637.539999999999
them raising them right and not just

8634.18 --> 8639.58
super pro gay or whatever so that they

8637.54 --> 8642.28
don't turn into deranged little demons

8639.58 --> 8646.319
that don't have any borders

8642.28 --> 8646.319000000001
right then I'm like yeah sure

8646.54 --> 8654.34
I mean I get it that people might object

8650.26 --> 8656.439
to that but I mean that's doable as long

8654.34 --> 8659.2
as they're actually good parents

8656.439 --> 8661.68
right and they can prove that

8659.2 --> 8661.68
but

8661.72 --> 8664.319
yeah

8664.54 --> 8670.0
technically yeah marriage is about in a

8667.66 --> 8673.359
man and a woman it's that basic

8670.0 --> 8678.52
and it is for procreation marriage is

8673.359 --> 8680.92
like a contract with God meant for

8678.52 --> 8683.800000000001
procreation

8680.92 --> 8685.72
and that can't effectively happen with

8683.8 --> 8690.66
homosexuals

8685.72 --> 8690.66
they can adopt right that's about it

8692.68 --> 8695.52
so yeah

8696.52 --> 8700.08
the kid would never have a mother

8702.04 --> 8709.359
you don't know it all depends right I

8705.7 --> 8712.26
mean a lot of gay couples have mothers

8709.359 --> 8712.26
still

8712.6 --> 8716.74
so there will probably be some female

8715.24 --> 8720.22
influences

8716.74 --> 8724.539999999999
some point it's not like Yay couples are

8720.22 --> 8727.599999999999
like like oh no we only hang with men

8724.54 --> 8730.060000000001
we never never face a woman no that

8727.6 --> 8732.58
doesn't exist so there will always be

8730.06 --> 8736.8
women involved

8732.58 --> 8736.8
adoption is not procreation yeah I agree

8739.42 --> 8746.88
I don't know man look I don't want I

8743.74 --> 8746.88
there's nothing

8747.0 --> 8753.1
productive I can add to that thing of

8750.46 --> 8757.179999999998
gay marriage just please don't ask me

8753.1 --> 8760.439
about it I I wanna sort of stay neutral

8757.18 --> 8760.439
in that because it's just like

8761.38 --> 8766.06
just don't do that to me okay don't do

8764.2 --> 8768.66
that to me

8766.06 --> 8768.66
please

8784.54 --> 8789.460000000001
right especially males that grow up with

8787.359 --> 8792.220000000001
no mother tend to not yeah well guess

8789.46 --> 8794.56
what they're adopted that means they

8792.22 --> 8796.42
don't have parents you see

8794.56 --> 8798.88
so

8796.42 --> 8801.7
are they gonna fare better not being

8798.88 --> 8805.619999999999
adopted by a gay couple

8801.7 --> 8805.62
this is a serious question right

8805.899 --> 8810.779999999999
it all is so convoluted

8820.3 --> 8826.179999999998
right so yeah I generally agree with you

8823.96 --> 8828.938999999998
guys it's just that I don't want to

8826.18 --> 8834.399
really take a position against like yeah

8828.939 --> 8837.54
oh no never you will never have gay

8834.399 --> 8837.539999999999
marriage never

8839.38 --> 8845.938999999998
please

8840.88 --> 8845.938999999998
please just leave me alone about it okay

8849.0 --> 8853.479
homophobic I don't want the sexuality in

8851.92 --> 8859.18
my face

8853.479 --> 8864.96
so don't force me then to think about

8859.18 --> 8864.960000000001
everything involving gays all the time

8869.319 --> 8872.1
I understand

8877.49 --> 8880.68
[Music]

8887.319 --> 8891.22
if I didn't grow up with a mom I would

8889.6 --> 8893.460000000001
have been an evil son of a [ __ ] I'm

8891.22 --> 8893.46
sure

8893.979 --> 8900.84
I have no idea if I survive my teens if

8897.7 --> 8900.84
I didn't grow up with the mother

8901.06 --> 8905.58
but I don't know I have nothing to

8902.979 --> 8905.58
compare it with

8920.14 --> 8926.34
great

8922.12 --> 8926.34
so yeah guys it's just

8928.24 --> 8932.939

9125.88 --> 9131.899
blabbering without a point yeah [ __ ] off

then

9148.02 --> 9152.7
walks into drama or you literally just

9150.72 --> 9157.019999999999
came walking in

9152.7 --> 9160.92
I've been overall very tolerant today

9157.02 --> 9163.5
but this ass face which I already gave

9160.92 --> 9165.979
him a notice like hey yeah I don't like

9163.5 --> 9165.979
your name

9166.38 --> 9171.479
and it seemed like they were gonna have

9168.78 --> 9172.560000000001
like a halfway normal conversation with

9171.479 --> 9176.279999999999
me

9172.56 --> 9177.539999999999
but then they end up like oh you're all

9176.28 --> 9179.640000000001
alone

9177.54 --> 9182.580000000002
you're the only one that thinks that

9179.64 --> 9184.46
Arwin just be human

9182.58 --> 9186.96
like yeah

9184.46 --> 9189.3
okay then

9186.96 --> 9192.119999999999
what does that mean are you suggesting

9189.3 --> 9194.22
that I'm not because that is kind of

9192.12 --> 9196.560000000001
what that implies when you say it like

9194.22 --> 9199.679999999998
that huh

9196.56 --> 9201.899
so does that mean oh

9199.68 --> 9204.720000000001
are winds wrong

9201.899 --> 9207.18
is that what that means

9204.72 --> 9210.358999999999
but he wouldn't say so he's like oh I'm

9207.18 --> 9213.74

9231.0 --> 9236.66
human on this show today very human

9249.85 --> 9252.969000000001
[Music]

9258.479 --> 9262.74

9260.64 --> 9265.58
confusing

9262.74 --> 9265.58
break back

9273.7 --> 9279.18
[Music]

9276.42 --> 9283.22
sometimes I wish I wasn't human

9279.18 --> 9283.220000000001
but I can't help it I am

9288.18 --> 9291.439
you woman

9292.08 --> 9294.74
LOL

9311.52 --> 9317.12
hmm

9313.14 --> 9320.479
be part of that yeah could be

9317.12 --> 9320.479000000001
xvhk green

9321.359 --> 9325.92
part of the herd that's my what it might

9323.22 --> 9328.5
be meaning I don't know it was just

9325.92 --> 9331.02
getting half

9328.5 --> 9332.88
like not paying attention anymore just

9331.02 --> 9335.16
like starting to blabber like it was

9332.88 --> 9337.759999999998
drunk or something so

9335.16 --> 9337.76
right

9338.28 --> 9345.0
if you just start literally degenerating

9341.88 --> 9347.42
visibly in my chat then I will just kick

9345.0 --> 9347.42
you out

9349.74 --> 9353.539999999999
was XXX trolling

9354.66 --> 9358.1
I don't know if he was

9360.479 --> 9365.039999999999
but he was certainly not behaving

9363.72 --> 9368.599999999999
properly

9365.04 --> 9368.6
and respectfully so

9374.58 --> 9379.439
he was trolling okay if you say so I

9377.399 --> 9382.22
don't really care if he was he's gone

9379.439 --> 9382.220000000001
now so

9387.66 --> 9391.58
to get some dinner or something

9392.399 --> 9401.479
ever had an early bird show this late

9396.24 --> 9401.479
I mean it's 22 past five here

9405.0 --> 9410.399
he could have just said I support Flat

9407.819 --> 9412.8
Earth and it will all have been fine no

9410.399 --> 9417.5
no it wouldn't

9412.8 --> 9417.5
yeah I ban flat earthers too

9417.96 --> 9424.16
you know how I ban people right in this

9420.96 --> 9424.16
chat or maybe you don't

9424.68 --> 9432.0
but I ban People based on their attitude

9428.1 --> 9434.24
their behavior and their willingness to

9432.0 --> 9434.24
learn

9434.28 --> 9440.460000000001
but I basically ban People based on

9437.34 --> 9443.1
their behavioral quality not on their

9440.46 --> 9446.58
philosophical convictions unless those

9443.1 --> 9450.24
philosophical convictions are overtly

9446.58 --> 9454.14
evil satanic and doublethink

9450.24 --> 9459.199999999999
because of the influence that will have

9454.14 --> 9459.199999999999
if you'd accept it into your circle

9461.16 --> 9466.5
so yeah there are there are ballers here

9464.28 --> 9469.979000000001
too right the issue though however on

9466.5 --> 9473.04
jet in general is on average

9469.979 --> 9476.819
welders will have more typical

9473.04 --> 9479.899000000001
ball issue related misbehavior but I'm

9476.819 --> 9479.899
expecting that right

9480.84 --> 9484.5
that's okay you need to learn to deal

9482.819 --> 9488.3
with that too

9484.5 --> 9488.3
from a bowler side perspective

9488.58 --> 9495.06
right so people can have misbehaviors if

9491.7 --> 9496.02
it's a natural thing that they face in

9495.06 --> 9497.939
the moment

9496.02 --> 9499.800000000001
and all kinds of people can have their

9497.939 --> 9502.02
time for it like I'm sick of this guy

9499.8 --> 9503.34
like Arwen I hate you today or whatever

9502.02 --> 9504.78
right

9503.34 --> 9506.76
it's okay

9504.78 --> 9508.62
doesn't mean that if we've been talking

9506.76 --> 9510.479
for like a year

9508.62 --> 9512.28
and having all kinds of good moments

9510.479 --> 9513.779999999999
that I'll just just because you had a

9512.28 --> 9515.76
really shitty day that I'm just gonna

9513.78 --> 9518.819000000001
kick you out and never talk to you again

9515.76 --> 9521.460000000001
no I might be like okay today you're

9518.819 --> 9523.019999999999
like on your period or something it's a

9521.46 --> 9525.24
figure of speech and then like okay I'm

9523.02 --> 9526.439
ban you I'll unban you tomorrow and see

9525.24 --> 9528.42
hope that you're going to be better

9526.439 --> 9530.64
that's happened that's happened a couple

9528.42 --> 9533.58
of times to a couple of people

9530.64 --> 9534.899
like ajam well by the way I rarely see

9533.58 --> 9537.12
him now but

9534.899 --> 9539.34
he used to hang around my chat all the

9537.12 --> 9541.92
time and then he got into

9539.34 --> 9544.979
moods

9541.92 --> 9547.319
that were like really bad moods and he

9544.979 --> 9548.76
just never shut up he'd never stop he

9547.319 --> 9551.16
would just be complaining he complain he

9548.76 --> 9553.68
complaining and very annoying well I

9551.16 --> 9555.84
knew that and I helped him to know that

9553.68 --> 9557.460000000001
about himself too and find a balance

9555.84 --> 9559.8
with it and I find him a lot more

9557.46 --> 9564.08
tolerable now

9559.8 --> 9564.08
then the first year that I knew him

9569.939 --> 9576.800000000001
oh my God at y'all

9573.66 --> 9576.8
oh dear God

9577.14 --> 9582.14
yeah it's metaphorical though not little

9582.66 --> 9588.8
I know people claim the most insane

9585.06 --> 9588.8
things it's the arranged

9593.22 --> 9599.599999999999
I'd ignore the trolls if it were me it

9597.24 --> 9602.64
seems they enjoy trolling and

9599.6 --> 9604.5
playing into your hands if you address

9602.64 --> 9605.84
them

9604.5 --> 9610.34
what

9605.84 --> 9613.62
I'm playing into their hands oh really

9610.34 --> 9616.460000000001
yes I'm playing into the Troll's hands

9613.62 --> 9620.279
it's not like I will absolutely Master

9616.46 --> 9622.199999999999
whatever they're trying to achieve right

9620.279 --> 9624.0
it's not like I crawl inside of their

9622.2 --> 9628.08
head and even like figure out how they

9624.0 --> 9630.42
came to that that point of doing that

9628.08 --> 9633.18
that I'm using

9630.42 --> 9637.56
their arrogance to basically lift the

9633.18 --> 9641.819
veil and divine them directly as I can

9637.56 --> 9646.08
but I mean I'm playing into their hands

9641.819 --> 9648.319
if I address them or I literally use

9646.08 --> 9651.359
them pull them in a freaking

9648.319 --> 9654.24
metaphorically sacrifice them on the

9651.359 --> 9657.779
altar right there and right then

9654.24 --> 9659.1
yeah now that's what I actually do

9657.779 --> 9662.220000000001
yeah

9659.1 --> 9665.220000000001
I'm not playing into their hands I'm

9662.22 --> 9669.899
using them

9665.22 --> 9673.08
they keep coming back keep coming back I

9669.899 --> 9677.699999999999
know you do yeah yeah you're not using

9673.08 --> 9682.7
me I'm sacrificing you on my altar yeah

9677.7 --> 9682.7
so keep coming back keep doing that

9687.65 --> 9690.809
[Music]

9699.12 --> 9704.399000000001
you seemed triggered and the Very

9701.46 --> 9706.319
thought of them well yesterday

9704.399 --> 9708.18
I was not feeling all that great

9706.319 --> 9710.399
remember I was always gonna almost gonna

9708.18 --> 9713.1
quit the show after like

9710.399 --> 9715.38
20 minutes because I felt kind of like

9713.1 --> 9716.939
tense then a troll came in

9715.38 --> 9719.819
and guess what

9716.939 --> 9722.1
they were to pull him in sacrifice him

9719.819 --> 9725.34
on the altar right there right then and

9722.1 --> 9728.1
guess what I felt restored immediately

9725.34 --> 9729.54
and I did a great show afterward

9728.1 --> 9731.52
full show

9729.54 --> 9734.060000000001
yeah

9731.52 --> 9734.060000000001
so

9734.58 --> 9740.22
get back to differ

9736.319 --> 9740.22
an open mind hmm

9749.04 --> 9752.0
laughs

9766.2 --> 9773.54
so yeah an open mind you need to stop

9769.26 --> 9773.54
telling me what I need to be doing

9774.06 --> 9779.939
and you need to stop thinking like be

9777.72 --> 9783.56
being triggered

9779.939 --> 9783.56
is even an issue here

9784.74 --> 9787.1
foreign

9790.2 --> 9794.640000000001
it gives me some energy I can do

9792.899 --> 9796.26
something with that and I do do

9794.64 --> 9799.92
something with that

9796.26 --> 9802.56
right if I can't use it properly

9799.92 --> 9804.6
yeah then I'll say like okay I've had

9802.56 --> 9807.0
enough of this now get the [ __ ] out

9804.6 --> 9808.859
trolls and I'll just kick them out yeah

9807.0 --> 9810.18
they'll come back but they always come

9808.859 --> 9813.979000000001
back yeah

9810.18 --> 9813.979000000001
they've always come back

9814.02 --> 9821.34
because I have a point

9817.859 --> 9824.220000000001
I have a level

9821.34 --> 9826.8
certain level frequency

9824.22 --> 9829.438999999998
an energy that's kind of bright and they

9826.8 --> 9831.358999999999
will always come back they will always

9829.439 --> 9833.76
come back they will do it every time

9831.359 --> 9837.779
doesn't matter whether I talk to them or

9833.76 --> 9840.359
not I've had a period okay an open mind

9837.779 --> 9843.300000000001
for for quite a while where I was

9840.359 --> 9844.56
literally trying to never talk to them

9843.3 --> 9847.14
ever

9844.56 --> 9849.72
and just ban whatever came along right

9847.14 --> 9850.858999999999
and just never try to address that they

9849.72 --> 9852.84
were even there

9850.859 --> 9855.12
guess what they did they started

9852.84 --> 9856.979
spamming me and then I literally didn't

9855.12 --> 9859.08
have a functioning chat anymore it

9856.979 --> 9862.76
doesn't work

9859.08 --> 9862.76
it doesn't work

9864.42 --> 9869.06
have to deal with them

9872.939 --> 9876.74
they're there to be dealt with

9879.24 --> 9885.199999999999
just be good at it just be good at

9882.18 --> 9885.2
dealing with the trolls

9886.979 --> 9891.119999999999
if they're coming for you then there's a

9889.859 --> 9893.7
reason

9891.12 --> 9896.279
they've potentially spotted a weakness

9893.7 --> 9898.92
or they've

9896.279 --> 9899.819000000001
grown into a dream where they think that

9898.92 --> 9902.939
they're

9899.819 --> 9905.819
better now right it's all these in

9902.939 --> 9909.24
pieces of information about what's going

9905.819 --> 9911.939
on on average that you can lend

9909.24 --> 9916.08
from troll Behavior

9911.939 --> 9917.7
yeah to me they're like a

9916.08 --> 9920.46
a readout

9917.7 --> 9923.04
like that's a readout

9920.46 --> 9924.839999999998
a state of mind that reflects as to

9923.04 --> 9927.18
what's going on out there even though

9924.84 --> 9929.279
it's just a small part of it it's still

9927.18 --> 9931.68
a part that's going to have fractal

9929.279 --> 9933.060000000001
resonation points with other people that

9931.68 --> 9937.56
are not involved in that specific

9933.06 --> 9940.859
situation and thus any person in a state

9937.56 --> 9945.66
of mind doing something is

9940.859 --> 9947.52
like a micro reflection of a crystal of

9945.66 --> 9950.58
what's going on in The Wider scale and

9947.52 --> 9952.02
that's how I Divine people

9950.58 --> 9954.92
anything

9952.02 --> 9954.92
any person

9958.08 --> 9962.479
they feed on fear right and they don't

9960.0 --> 9962.479
fear them

9965.22 --> 9968.42
like I really don't

9970.5 --> 9978.14
right that's if I fear them

9973.68 --> 9978.14
that's where they really start to feed

9981.779 --> 9986.399000000001
ignoring them is not an option for yeah

9984.54 --> 9988.68
well trying to ignore them is not going

9986.399 --> 9991.68
to make them go away in open mind

9988.68 --> 9994.2
hey hey how long have you had a live

9991.68 --> 9998.720000000001
show every day

9994.2 --> 10002.42
huh five years do you do you have

9998.72 --> 10006.519999999999
1229 episode of live shows

10002.42 --> 10006.52
to reflect upon and make that judgment

10007.7 --> 10014.54
yeah ignoring them isn't an option it

10011.24 --> 10017.18
isn't in reality

10014.54 --> 10019.76
because they always do come back

10017.18 --> 10022.939
yeah it's not an option the only way to

10019.76 --> 10026.0
do that is to close the chat

10022.939 --> 10029.24
close the chat yeah guess what I'm not

10026.0 --> 10031.939
gonna do that because that's my workshop

10029.24 --> 10034.88
the chat is my workshop

10031.939 --> 10038.18
trolls wandering in is something that's

10034.88 --> 10041.42
always going to happen can't stop it

10038.18 --> 10043.76
not going to close my workshop on the

10041.42 --> 10045.02
chance that a typical troll is going to

10043.76 --> 10047.42
walk in

10045.02 --> 10049.16
I gotta keep it open just gotta need to

10047.42 --> 10051.460000000001
deal with the trolls when they come in

10049.16 --> 10051.46
right

10052.16 --> 10054.819
that's it

10056.16 --> 10061.67
[Music]

10064.35 --> 10067.419
[Music]

10070.819 --> 10075.5
it's your first time on YouTube never

10073.1 --> 10078.08
had a live stream right okay

10075.5 --> 10081.38
or in that case

10078.08 --> 10082.58
I guess you're trying to give me good

10081.38 --> 10085.16
advice

10082.58 --> 10088.039999999999
but

10085.16 --> 10089.96
do you honestly have something to base

10088.04 --> 10093.02
that advice of

10089.96 --> 10095.479
unpractical experience in order to make

10093.02 --> 10098.720000000001
that judgment call that that would work

10095.479 --> 10101.0
you see I just gave you elaborate

10098.72 --> 10104.24
counter argumentation based on my

10101.0 --> 10107.0
practical experience of 1229 episodes

10104.24 --> 10108.68
and more right and a flatter talk show

10107.0 --> 10109.939
before this

10108.68 --> 10113.68
so

10109.939 --> 10113.68
unfortunately it doesn't work

10114.14 --> 10119.899
right there's only two ways you can get

10116.54 --> 10121.580000000002
rid of trolls that's you fully adapt to

10119.899 --> 10124.34
the Beast vernacular

10121.58 --> 10127.039999999999
you basically become

10124.34 --> 10129.5
the devil in order to stop them doing

10127.04 --> 10132.800000000001
that so they'll be see you as just

10129.5 --> 10134.96
another thing they'll become Spellbound

10132.8 --> 10136.22
and they'll stop it

10134.96 --> 10138.679999999998
or

10136.22 --> 10143.26
you fight them

10138.68 --> 10143.26
and you learn how to do that really well

10144.979 --> 10151.399
and then you don't change and then you

10147.5 --> 10153.8
make it a challenge to not change

10151.399 --> 10156.74
with the expectancy and the anticipation

10153.8 --> 10158.3
of the trolls coming and being ready to

10156.74 --> 10160.64
deal with it

10158.3 --> 10163.519999999999
right it's a side effect the trolls

10160.64 --> 10166.519999999999
coming is a natural side effect of the

10163.52 --> 10168.7
Beast system and people not adapting to

10166.52 --> 10168.7
it

10175.819 --> 10181.278999999999
it's blocking you really the answer yeah

10178.16 --> 10185.0
yeah it is you see you asking that

10181.279 --> 10188.08
question is immediately grounds to ban

10185.0 --> 10188.08
you you see

10189.319 --> 10195.439
because I wasn't going to demand you

10192.62 --> 10198.140000000001
but now that you already suggested that

10195.439 --> 10200.779
you will be banned means that you are a

10198.14 --> 10204.8
troll that's only here

10200.779 --> 10207.74
to get another oh I got banned by Arwin

10204.8 --> 10209.899
sticker right I mean you collect those

10207.74 --> 10211.399
stickers don't you but you have your

10209.899 --> 10214.34
whole room

10211.399 --> 10216.979
I'm sorry your whole basement

10214.34 --> 10221.08
filled up with stickers that say I got

10216.979 --> 10221.08
banned by Arwin I bet you collect that

10231.26 --> 10234.859
he lost the plot yeah right whatever

10233.42 --> 10237.319
they're going to say they're losing the

10234.859 --> 10239.720000000001
plot they're not they don't know what

10237.319 --> 10242.06
the [ __ ] they're doing

10239.72 --> 10244.039999999999
I have no grip on themselves and they

10242.06 --> 10247.039999999999
can't handle it they can't handle that

10244.04 --> 10250.7
there's a guy here that opposes so much

10247.04 --> 10252.92
that's in control that is actually in

10250.7 --> 10256.58
control of himself in control of the

10252.92 --> 10260.42
situation and in control of you

10256.58 --> 10263.3
if you show up in my chat to a degree

10260.42 --> 10266.68
yeah they can't handle it

10263.3 --> 10269.539999999999
they're not growing they're not growing

10266.68 --> 10273.460000000001
towards a position where they can handle

10269.54 --> 10273.460000000001
it and that's their freaking problem

10274.819 --> 10280.22
does YouTube let you see how many trolls

10277.04 --> 10282.939
you've banned yes there is a list it's a

10280.22 --> 10282.938999999998
very big list

10310.7 --> 10316.390000000001
according to chat rules akumu should be

10314.06 --> 10319.6
banned daily why

10316.39 --> 10319.599999999999
[Music]

10329.359 --> 10334.1
right is it because of no it doesn't it

10332.66 --> 10336.619999999999
doesn't have a wrench he doesn't abuse

10334.1 --> 10338.300000000001
he doesn't ask for a wrench as a

10336.62 --> 10340.460000000001
supposed newcomer

10338.3 --> 10343.759999999998
and

10340.46 --> 10345.919999999998
right he isn't a Heckler not following

10343.76 --> 10348.319
the show he does follow the show right

10345.92 --> 10350.479
the heckler's not following the show is

10348.319 --> 10353.66
for people that are specifically going

10350.479 --> 10356.06
after people in my chat and not

10353.66 --> 10357.68
listening to what I say right they're

10356.06 --> 10359.66
not actually here for the show they're

10357.68 --> 10361.16
just there to harass people and chat

10359.66 --> 10363.74
specifically

10361.16 --> 10366.2
that's where that rule is for

10363.74 --> 10369.26
does that happen

10366.2 --> 10373.220000000001
right I don't see how akumo virus is

10369.26 --> 10376.0
directly violating the chat directive

10373.22 --> 10376.0
for my show

10379.46 --> 10384.699999999999
yes he argues the same point but that's

10381.56 --> 10384.699999999999
because he's a [ __ ]

10385.52 --> 10390.74
and he is polite by tactic indeed right

10388.34 --> 10392.06
now of course if he's gonna just Spam or

10390.74 --> 10394.52
whatever

10392.06 --> 10396.859
and at some if it's like really in the

10394.52 --> 10400.76
way then I will ban him but it will just

10396.859 --> 10402.979000000001
also unman him afterward because he is

10400.76 --> 10404.899
not gonna go away guys you have to

10402.979 --> 10407.599999999999
realize akumu virus

10404.899 --> 10410.539999999999
you're gonna see a kumu virus in a year

10407.6 --> 10412.939
from now in two years from now

10410.54 --> 10416.84
I mean who knows maybe he's not even a

10412.939 --> 10419.479000000001
person anymore maybe he's just a CGI

10416.84 --> 10421.76
hologram scan

10419.479 --> 10423.74
and he's actually dead and he uploaded

10421.76 --> 10425.6
himself and it's just there and it just

10423.74 --> 10426.979
keeps coming back and he's always going

10425.6 --> 10429.439
to come back

10426.979 --> 10430.599999999999
with voice and all I don't know probably

10429.439 --> 10435.04
not

10430.6 --> 10435.04
I'm just saying he's not gonna go away

10438.8 --> 10443.358999999999
right

10440.6 --> 10445.1
it's like complaining about that crazy

10443.359 --> 10448.220000000001
smelly

10445.1 --> 10450.5
guy that's always hanging in the street

10448.22 --> 10452.778999999999
in that Village right they're not gonna

10450.5 --> 10456.26
go away what you're gonna kill them or

10452.779 --> 10459.640000000001
something I said that egregious or you

10456.26 --> 10459.64
could just learn a deal with him

10460.399 --> 10464.84
right

10462.56 --> 10466.76
just learn to deal with him it's very

10464.84 --> 10469.34
annoying but there's always going to be

10466.76 --> 10471.319
something annoying it's always gonna pop

10469.34 --> 10473.899
up if you get rid of something that's

10471.319 --> 10477.019999999999
annoying something else that's annoying

10473.899 --> 10478.76
is going to take its place and that's a

10477.02 --> 10481.899000000001
natural fact

10478.76 --> 10481.899
always happens

10486.08 --> 10492.02
to suck every year slowly yeah yeah he

10489.68 --> 10494.300000000001
is kind of a weirdo energy vampire at

10492.02 --> 10497.800000000001
times I agree damn it

10494.3 --> 10497.8
he is a bit creepy guy

10510.74 --> 10514.22
all right anyway I think I'm going to

10512.3 --> 10518.38
round out the show guys it's been a very

10514.22 --> 10518.38
long show almost three hours

10519.5 --> 10523.479
but it gotta end it sometime

10526.7 --> 10531.2
right so yeah

10529.1 --> 10533.380000000001
this show was certainly all over the

10531.2 --> 10533.380000000001
place

10534.92 --> 10540.08
and I mean all over the place

10537.979 --> 10542.72
but yeah I hope you all thought it was

10540.08 --> 10545.6
interesting I did get to into some

10542.72 --> 10547.22
detail about my personal convictions and

10545.6 --> 10549.5
why

10547.22 --> 10552.74
also lots of spirit mechanics talk

10549.5 --> 10555.279
especially the first half

10552.74 --> 10555.279
so

10555.319 --> 10558.819
thanks everyone for coming

10566.479 --> 10572.06
now that's not what I said agent Smith

10569.24 --> 10573.68
that's not what I said at all

10572.06 --> 10575.0
it's not to get rid of something

10573.68 --> 10576.68
annoying something else that was

10575.0 --> 10580.7
annoying has to take it that's not what

10576.68 --> 10582.859
I said what I said is if you get rid of

10580.7 --> 10586.04
something annoying

10582.859 --> 10588.62
if you get rid of it not to get rid of

10586.04 --> 10590.060000000001
it if you get rid of something annoying

10588.62 --> 10592.220000000001
something else is going to take its

10590.06 --> 10595.34
place it's not oh let's put something

10592.22 --> 10596.899
annoying there to replace the other

10595.34 --> 10598.779
annoying thing

10596.899 --> 10601.099999999999
I mean

10598.779 --> 10604.34
technically that might be possible

10601.1 --> 10608.24
that's not what I said though

10604.34 --> 10610.939
I'm just saying if you want to eliminate

10608.24 --> 10613.58
something annoying from your con from

10610.939 --> 10616.220000000001
your focus forever you have to take into

10613.58 --> 10618.319
account it's always going to be replaced

10616.22 --> 10620.92
because that naturally happens that's

10618.319 --> 10620.92
what I said

10624.08 --> 10629.6
right so thanks everyone for coming I

10627.38 --> 10631.699999999999
