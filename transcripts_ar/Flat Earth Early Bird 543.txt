weather is just wow it is warm very warm

80.979 --> 88.479
outside it's a little moist too but it's

85.42 --> 90.52
just predominantly warm it's an

88.479 --> 95.71
interesting type of clouds out there

90.52 --> 100.119
look at that doesn't necessarily see

95.71 --> 102.49
chemtrail a shallow look at that that's

100.119 --> 106.569
a really high altitude plane over there

102.49 --> 108.52
and it is leaving a strike but it's kind

106.569 --> 113.46900000000001
of covered up by the fluffy little

108.52 --> 119.32
clouds up there so I don't know it's

113.469 --> 124.44999999999999
just really warm yesterday also as the

119.32 --> 130.509
day progressed it it became warmer and

124.45 --> 133.5
it's been like that all right a really

130.509 --> 133.5
warm Oh

136.92 --> 152.17
so ah I got green tea with me that's it

145.86 --> 155.11
let's see who isn't Jack alright a man

152.17 --> 162.39
they almost first good servant Robin

155.11 --> 162.39000000000001
Stanley over Mukul Yabba Missouri bear

164.52 --> 179.56
right good to see you all on this

172.93 --> 181.54000000000002
Tuesday yeah it might be a little bit

179.56 --> 185.47
slower than usual because it was very

181.54 --> 190.26999999999998
very late night for me eh just I don't

185.47 --> 192.60999999999999
know why just a right and I do know not

190.27 --> 198.49
I still don't know why I just wasn't

192.61 --> 200.5
that tired for some reason it might be

198.49 --> 202.45000000000002
because of the the warmth contrast

200.5 --> 204.94
because when it gets really warm during

202.45 --> 207.01
the day then in the evening that worth

204.94 --> 209.77
kind of lasts and then at some point it

207.01 --> 213.84
hits a really really nice temperature

209.77 --> 216.58
it's like the ideal temperature and that

213.84 --> 221.5
makes me want to keep up longer I don't

216.58 --> 223.9
know what it is but yeah because that I

221.5 --> 227.47
also managed to get this the second Owen

223.9 --> 229.95000000000002
Benjamin stream and that was just great

227.47 --> 229.95
stuff

235.19 --> 249.9
yeah great also this morning was a very

244.83 --> 254.04000000000002
pleasantly surprised dad yeah I finally

249.9 --> 258.42
got the money so I'm having a little

254.04 --> 261.989
baby dragon moment feeling incredibly

258.42 --> 264.63
rich but I know that's mostly just

261.989 --> 273.9
virtual it's all been designated pretty

264.63 --> 275.31
much but yeah now looking for a certain

273.9 --> 279.81
type of products that have been waiting

275.31 --> 282.72
for a very long time and I'm gonna

279.81 --> 286.23
carefully work on that not spend it all

282.72 --> 287.91
at once but at least I'm gonna get the

286.23 --> 294.06
air filter and it's still in the big

287.91 --> 299.04
discount so yeah once I managed to get

294.06 --> 302.99
that arranged then I'll finally have

299.04 --> 307.41
some fresh air here can't wait for that

302.99 --> 311.13
really looking forward to it also I

307.41 --> 315.48
noticed that like the what is it the the

311.13 --> 319.08
quail egg powder extract thingy was also

315.48 --> 320.39000000000004
on sale so I'm gonna try one of those

319.08 --> 323.94
too you know because

320.39 --> 327.0
yeah I think that I do definitely have

323.94 --> 330.71
at least light hay fever symptoms and

327.0 --> 334.26
that should work against that very well

330.71 --> 337.77
so so are the stories at least oh god

334.26 --> 340.17
it's so go the stories so I'm eager to

337.77 --> 343.32
kind of try that out because I I get

340.17 --> 346.86
sniffles a lot like spontaneous sneezes

343.32 --> 350.3
out to nowhere it's kind of annoying

346.86 --> 350.3
especially now

355.56 --> 362.849
hmm all right so let's see what you guys

360.219 --> 362.849
are talking about

381.279 --> 390.879
okay Missouri Bear Missouri bear says he

386.769 --> 394.799
has a Bible that's unaffected by Mandela

390.879 --> 394.79900000000004
effect that's very interesting

408.91 --> 413.78000000000003
another one that's completely - gravel

411.59 --> 416.02
so you have like a really old Bible you

413.78 --> 416.02
say

422.83 --> 432.19
hmm right indeed that was my question -

428.259 --> 438.599
Robin Stanley you your first who is the

432.19 --> 438.599
publisher that kind of man matters

495.21 --> 498.21
okay

498.58 --> 502.60999999999996
all right

500.6 --> 507.5
Thomas Nelson I don't know who that is

502.61 --> 510.26
but it is kind of interesting now the

507.5 --> 516.14
yeah with the Mandela effect and like

510.26 --> 519.71
the irregularities the two basically

516.14 --> 523.01
trace back with the books especially the

519.71 --> 527.1700000000001
ones that aren't changed or see yeah as

523.01 --> 530.36
you claim to see

527.17 --> 532.67
yeah who who those people are and like

530.36 --> 535.28
were they like completely independently

532.67 --> 540.62
doing that not connected to any kind of

535.28 --> 543.17
organization because that would bring

540.62 --> 545.33
yeah bring you closer to figuring out

543.17 --> 549.43
like what what the Mandela effect really

545.33 --> 553.0300000000001
is we're like how where it's coming from

549.43 --> 553.03
what's doing that

590.69 --> 602.75
man it's really hot here by the way it's

598.769 --> 602.75
almost shirtless levels of hot

612.329 --> 616.069
a red priestly

619.46 --> 625.3000000000001
Voynich AGM

642.33 --> 647.5500000000001
alright by the way I think I'm just

644.07 --> 649.9200000000001
gonna hm has been through Jim Jones in

647.55 --> 652.3199999999999
my chat and I don't know what he thinks

649.92 --> 656.4599999999999
about that I do see him his other

652.32 --> 660.1800000000001
account know about chats but yeah he's

656.46 --> 663.9300000000001
been very well behaved and I think I

660.18 --> 668.28
think he found a new balance so I kind

663.93 --> 675.4699999999999
of feel like unblocking him with his

668.28 --> 675.47
original whatever he feels about that

678.02 --> 687.51
but you know if he can keep this up of

680.73 --> 689.36
course turn over a new leaf new page

687.51 --> 693.03
mm-hm

689.36 --> 699.33
right anyway yes and I have to figure

693.03 --> 705.18
out like how to do that now because the

699.33 --> 707.6
new system right now I'll find it yeah

705.18 --> 707.5999999999999
see

709.69 --> 714.97
I know where to find I'm just being

711.7 --> 720.6600000000001
cranky about it I don't like having

714.97 --> 720.6600000000001
things procedures changed on me

746.64 --> 749.88
come on

768.42 --> 772.65
sorry for the long silences

787.66 --> 791.9399999999999
oh god it's too many

800.66 --> 803.93
come on

810.59 --> 817.0400000000001
it's gonna take some time sorry for the

814.14 --> 817.04
slow start today

820.2 --> 829.589
oh yeah oh great oh that's that's just

825.389 --> 831.42
brilliant search system it is like his

829.589 --> 836.36
name is actually highlighted but it

831.42 --> 836.36
didn't jump to it that's just brilliant

839.87 --> 847.7090000000001
right anyway I got your ATM account

844.949 --> 855.389
unblocked finally so if you want you can

847.709 --> 861.9899999999999
switch back and keep it up anyway let's

855.389 --> 864.12
continue the show I didn't know man I

861.99 --> 867.5600000000001
feel I'm really in like a type of

864.12 --> 870.269
sunbathing type mood I wish I had like a

867.56 --> 874.13
stretcher or whatever I'd put it under

870.269 --> 874.13
Ruth and just sunbathe there for a while

875.57 --> 881.61
but yeah I would have to have a like

879.24 --> 883.769
thing to lay on because the rocks are

881.61 --> 886.019
way too warm now and just a towel or

883.769 --> 897.48
something is not gonna help it's way too

886.019 --> 904.97
hot unlock right to hand oh come on he's

897.48 --> 911.029
not there no God okay sure I'll try it

904.97 --> 913.769
try to find him also then although I

911.029 --> 919.11
really don't get why you want that so

913.769 --> 922.16
much I don't know what it's just too

919.11 --> 922.16
much Sivan hey

932.84 --> 937.7
and you know in order to deal with me

935.96 --> 942.6800000000001
you got to be able to handle criticism

937.7 --> 945.32
that's real it's just a must it's a

942.68 --> 958.81
demand and it's kind of a demand that I

945.32 --> 958.8100000000001
uphold myself to as well let's see okay

959.74 --> 970.15
well that didn't take long to figure out

966.11 --> 970.15
that he's not in there

982.49 --> 990.5600000000001
yeah and he's not in my blocked system

985.25 --> 997.34
either with Google you know so I don't

990.56 --> 1001.77
get how that how that is he's just not

997.34 --> 1004.57
in my blocked list in my chat he isn't

1001.77 --> 1005.9499999999999
and he's not blocked by me either sorry

1004.57 --> 1009.94
I just don't know what's keeping him

1005.95 --> 1017.7
blocked I just don't know I don't know

1009.94 --> 1017.7
maybe might be blocked right away what

1027.05 --> 1032.29
okay have a okay okay JLo

1034.12 --> 1043.03
but yeah I'm should move on to talking

1039.29 --> 1046.52
about subjects I agree

1043.03 --> 1050.1499999999999
but yeah I'm just so chill out I'm kind

1046.52 --> 1052.4
of like yeah not even an hour ago I just

1050.15 --> 1055.91
figured I have this money so it's just

1052.4 --> 1067.1000000000001
kind of sinking in and it makes me a

1055.91 --> 1068.72
little numb maybe Google permanently

1067.1 --> 1070.85
blocked him from everybody no that's

1068.72 --> 1077.78
that wouldn't make any sense a good

1070.85 --> 1085.52
servant now because you can still see

1077.78 --> 1087.56
him so oh I seem to be in a good karma

1085.52 --> 1089.93
today well I don't think that's a

1087.56 --> 1097.37
technical correct statement if you're

1089.93 --> 1098.9
going to draw the word Carmen I don't

1097.37 --> 1100.76
know it it all feels natural

1098.9 --> 1102.77
I don't feel something unnatural sappy I

1100.76 --> 1105.74
feel like a lot of things seems to have

1102.77 --> 1108.71
moved on an interesting thing I figured

1105.74 --> 1116.09
out also is that yeah come on the roof a

1108.71 --> 1119.66
lot and the little jackdaw babies that

1116.09 --> 1123.11
are in the chimney nest have been here

1119.66 --> 1126.5600000000002
like it seems like well at least one of

1123.11 --> 1129.6499999999999
them I don't know if there's it could be

1126.56 --> 1132.4099999999999
that I think there were at least two but

1129.65 --> 1134.69
I'm only hearing one now so I think that

1132.41 --> 1138.74
probably might have been some natural

1134.69 --> 1140.39
selection going on but yeah the the

1138.74 --> 1143.63
squeaking baby suddenly stopped

1140.39 --> 1146.72
squeaking he now has a jackdaw voice so

1143.63 --> 1150.5600000000002
I think that over this Naheed I didn't I

1146.72 --> 1153.08
barely heard him yesterday I think it's

1150.56 --> 1154.73
him I'm just assuming it to him I don't

1153.08 --> 1156.6999999999998
know I'm just being sexist or whatever

1154.73 --> 1161.75
but

1156.7 --> 1165.6200000000001
yeah this quick changed into a a jackdaw

1161.75 --> 1176.66
yeah very so it's is super cute to hear

1165.62 --> 1179.12
so I noticed that this morning yeah and

1176.66 --> 1180.799
it was kind of funny because they had

1179.12 --> 1181.25
the parents were just sitting there on

1180.799 --> 1184.52
tops

1181.25 --> 1188.84
staring at it and they were like trying

1184.52 --> 1193.0
to I think I may have actually heard the

1188.84 --> 1196.4289999999999
first jack - no sound from that little

1193.0 --> 1198.11
baby when the parents were present like

1196.429 --> 1200.24
I didn't even I probably didn't even

1198.11 --> 1204.35
realize because they were like staring

1200.24 --> 1207.41
at it like what is this and then like

1204.35 --> 1212.12
after middle of it just they suddenly

1207.41 --> 1216.5900000000001
like they went off like frantic it was

1212.12 --> 1218.9599999999998
it was very funny to see that now I'm

1216.59 --> 1220.73
just realizing you like wow this might

1218.96 --> 1232.04
have been like the first time it spoke

1220.73 --> 1234.26
up with a its with its voice how could a

1232.04 --> 1237.47
state channel as a dad trying different

1234.26 --> 1240.16
birds nest okay well I don't have a

1237.47 --> 1244.429
camera on it

1240.16 --> 1248.179
urban birding I don't know I guess I am

1244.429 --> 1250.0700000000002
kind of like a bird man I don't know how

1248.179 --> 1252.23
it came to that well I mean it probably

1250.07 --> 1254.8999999999999
has something to do with that it's a

1252.23 --> 1259.25
roof and they're like active on the roof

1254.9 --> 1261.38
a lot so it's just very interesting it's

1259.25 --> 1263.63
just a unique opportunity that arrived

1261.38 --> 1267.6200000000001
with me being here I never expected that

1263.63 --> 1269.8090000000002
I've never lived like on a on the top

1267.62 --> 1274.3899999999999
floor on the roof level floor of an

1269.809 --> 1278.32
apartment building before like this so

1274.39 --> 1278.3200000000002
I'd never realized that

1278.75 --> 1286.23
hmm before I was more like a cat guy I'm

1284.159 --> 1289.47
still kind of a cat guy I'm still

1286.23 --> 1291.1200000000001
staring from from the rooftops two cats

1289.47 --> 1294.21
just prowling around there's a lot of

1291.12 --> 1297.03
cat fighting going on a lot but it's

1294.21 --> 1299.549
just territorial yeah

1297.03 --> 1302.07
pushing around not really any severe

1299.549 --> 1307.3799999999999
fighting there's no there's no savage

1302.07 --> 1308.73
gets a lot of young young cats that I've

1307.38 --> 1311.13
seen growing over the last two years

1308.73 --> 1313.08
that were like really young and just

1311.13 --> 1319.5590000000002
sneaking around they've turned a little

1313.08 --> 1322.1999999999998
bit more more hormonal and yeah it's

1319.559 --> 1325.71
just walking around I don't get too

1322.2 --> 1327.69
close to me and just constantly like you

1325.71 --> 1329.64
can just see them doubt like whether

1327.69 --> 1331.3500000000001
they really wanna engage but they're

1329.64 --> 1332.49
also afraid and they want to get in

1331.35 --> 1334.8899999999999
they're afraid and they're constantly

1332.49 --> 1338.61
being pushed back and forth between that

1334.89 --> 1348.8400000000001
it's like this silly dance that can last

1338.61 --> 1351.6299999999999
a very long time it's funny I say

1348.84 --> 1357.51
neither I prefer a woman yeah looking

1351.63 --> 1362.3700000000001
down to a lot of women also in a way I'm

1357.51 --> 1365.309
really trying to figure out like what

1362.37 --> 1370.4699999999998
what type of woman am I really looking

1365.309 --> 1372.299
for and not to get drawn into things

1370.47 --> 1374.6100000000001
that I have been looking for in the past

1372.299 --> 1377.6689999999999
that probably don't lead to a good

1374.61 --> 1380.07
situation because I think that I

1377.669 --> 1382.5900000000001
probably died probably not the only one

1380.07 --> 1385.559
that's like drawn to type that aren't

1382.59 --> 1391.289
very good for me but that just like

1385.559 --> 1394.08
charm me so so much although there are

1391.289 --> 1398.1589999999999
types out there that charm me a lot and

1394.08 --> 1400.23
that aren't bad for me but yeah it's

1398.159 --> 1405.2800000000002
very rare for those types to not be

1400.23 --> 1409.48
taken and because those are the keepers

1405.28 --> 1411.61
yeah all right

1409.48 --> 1417.01
the trick is just to get a life and then

1411.61 --> 1418.57
and then find the opportunity the real

1417.01 --> 1422.95
problem for me is is that I'm so

1418.57 --> 1424.6599999999999
solitary so that it's not easy for

1422.95 --> 1427.18
people to bump into me like that they

1424.66 --> 1429.6100000000001
really have to seek me out and that's

1427.18 --> 1431.41
kind of an [ __ ] it's like a task for

1429.61 --> 1436.84
a lot of people yeah it sounds really

1431.41 --> 1439.38
like [ __ ] you know but yeah if you if

1436.84 --> 1442.54
there's something about me that really

1439.38 --> 1449.68
compels you then yeah I'm a very loyal

1442.54 --> 1452.23
friend and that's just how I seem to

1449.68 --> 1454.5700000000002
work but it would be much more

1452.23 --> 1458.53
convenient for me if I actually had a

1454.57 --> 1460.6299999999999
bar just going around life where I have

1458.53 --> 1463.72
the chance to bump into a lot of people

1460.63 --> 1466.0900000000001
while I am doing things and I realized

1463.72 --> 1468.58
this this is how I've met by acts too

1466.09 --> 1472.2099999999998
and now that that's just from going out

1468.58 --> 1474.6699999999998
regularly it's because I was just going

1472.21 --> 1478.71
out regularly at a place and then at one

1474.67 --> 1483.0700000000002
time I was just in a very special mood I

1478.71 --> 1485.02
felt really confident I was like wow I'm

1483.07 --> 1487.03
getting out of the [ __ ] for the first

1485.02 --> 1490.72
time I'm really gonna go for it and then

1487.03 --> 1495.1
I met her there and it's just completely

1490.72 --> 1496.96
blew me away but in a silent way very

1495.1 --> 1499.4199999999998
much in the inside because I had all the

1496.96 --> 1502.51
energy I didn't destabilize it didn't

1499.42 --> 1504.64
break down from the awe of it which

1502.51 --> 1508.72
sometimes happens I can get a bit

1504.64 --> 1511.95
overwhelmed but I didn't and it just

1508.72 --> 1519.22
worked because I just took it easy

1511.95 --> 1523.0
because I could but yeah it still

1519.22 --> 1526.6000000000001
mystifies me that moment like how did

1523.0 --> 1530.68
that work how did it get to that because

1526.6 --> 1533.83
I rarely I've been to be even before

1530.68 --> 1536.2
that I've been dwelling a lot like oh I

1533.83 --> 1537.54
want a girlfriend I want something I was

1536.2 --> 1539.67
really kind of looking

1537.54 --> 1541.44
even though I knew I shouldn't because

1539.67 --> 1543.14
it doesn't really work but it just

1541.44 --> 1548.97
couldn't help it I was like really

1543.14 --> 1552.8400000000001
longing to be with somebody and he

1548.97 --> 1557.09
didn't work all of most of the times and

1552.84 --> 1559.86
fooling around a bit but yeah did I

1557.09 --> 1563.31
guess I was just a like an overly

1559.86 --> 1565.62
romantic at the time and yeah it was

1563.31 --> 1568.3999999999999
something I had to go through I I don't

1565.62 --> 1568.3999999999999
do that anymore

1569.87 --> 1575.55
because it doesn't really make you happy

1572.25 --> 1578.22
just makes you feel more alone but more

1575.55 --> 1584.8799999999999
isolated when you when you try really

1578.22 --> 1587.97
hard and it's not working hmm so the

1584.88 --> 1589.8600000000001
trick is to figure out a life where you

1587.97 --> 1591.78
deal with people and not be alone and

1589.86 --> 1595.11
not feel alone and become stronger

1591.78 --> 1599.67
crushing it so Benjamin says and then

1595.11 --> 1600.99
yes the types wills that resonate they

1599.67 --> 1603.78
yeah you will

1600.99 --> 1607.23
just people will just step up to you and

1603.78 --> 1611.04
and they kind of know where you are

1607.23 --> 1614.25
and there's the opportunities and then

1611.04 --> 1616.44
figuring it out on that level like how

1614.25 --> 1617.94
does it actually work when you function

1616.44 --> 1622.26
on that level because that's very

1617.94 --> 1624.21
different it's another world socially to

1622.26 --> 1627.48
it just everything works different on

1624.21 --> 1630.51
that level when you're really crushing

1627.48 --> 1633.75
it as when you're just muttering a

1630.51 --> 1636.96
little when you drag down by yourself a

1633.75 --> 1641.88
lot it's it's a different world things

1636.96 --> 1645.24
worked and it's it's old can be surreal

1641.88 --> 1647.3400000000001
and for me it was even unnerving like

1645.24 --> 1650.3700000000001
really unnerving it made me nervous

1647.34 --> 1653.6399999999999
it's like nothing not none of this makes

1650.37 --> 1657.4799999999998
sense like all my machinations of like

1653.64 --> 1659.97
like these justifications as to how

1657.48 --> 1662.52
everything functioned in order to me fit

1659.97 --> 1666.09
to feel some kind of virtual justice

1662.52 --> 1669.06
none of that made any sense anymore just

1666.09 --> 1671.809
it was all everything was so easy that

1669.06 --> 1674.49
it was just nonsense now

1671.809 --> 1679.4089999999999
that's one of the most distinct things I

1674.49 --> 1682.6490000000001
remember from that from that switch and

1679.409 --> 1686.519
that's why I usually don't like to

1682.649 --> 1690.4799999999998
switch suddenly I come on this abrupt

1686.519 --> 1693.299
change you know that happens a lot with

1690.48 --> 1697.259
me often ie or has happened I'm

1693.299 --> 1699.75
everything now for me is to do it

1697.259 --> 1705.289
gradually so I can take get used to it

1699.75 --> 1705.289
and really go there to stay there

1707.269 --> 1715.379
and it's a big puzzle for me it doesn't

1713.159 --> 1717.96
I don't know it just doesn't come some

1715.379 --> 1726.83
supernatural that's super it doesn't

1717.96 --> 1733.909
come naturally or it used to but yeah I

1726.83 --> 1733.9089999999999
venerable to conflict or I used to be

1751.46 --> 1758.409
what are you guys talking about but

1754.51 --> 1758.4089999999999
Shawn throwing it or what

1778.27 --> 1786.29
and sexual activities for making

1780.68 --> 1788.72
children well I have a of course because

1786.29 --> 1792.59
I Marwan and I'm I always have to

1788.72 --> 1795.19
freaking get in find some kind of middle

1792.59 --> 1802.55
way in between like I think that

1795.19 --> 1805.25
sexuality is indeed eventually made to

1802.55 --> 1806.09
produce children of course but there's

1805.25 --> 1809.15
more to it

1806.09 --> 1812.51
you know like mm things like sex

1809.15 --> 1815.5400000000002
addiction are bad because why because of

1812.51 --> 1818.93
what it does to you because it it keeps

1815.54 --> 1822.46
you tied to a very narrow thing like all

1818.93 --> 1826.8500000000001
obsessions are connections right and

1822.46 --> 1829.94
it's for a lot of people very easy to

1826.85 --> 1833.98
catch on if you get into that I am one

1829.94 --> 1838.72
of those people have to realize that but

1833.98 --> 1842.96
if you can be responsible with it and

1838.72 --> 1847.58
use moments like then yeah it becomes

1842.96 --> 1851.51
like a yeah a very positive influence

1847.58 --> 1853.6399999999999
like you could call it sex magic oh dear

1851.51 --> 1857.12
I said it right and that's not that

1853.64 --> 1861.8600000000001
should not be dark [ __ ] that should not

1857.12 --> 1865.2399999999998
be like breaking and corrupting and that

1861.86 --> 1868.1599999999999
[ __ ] it should be a spiritual

1865.24 --> 1872.84
conjunction and it should be there with

1868.16 --> 1876.3200000000002
love like I I could never have sex with

1872.84 --> 1882.32
somebody without being able to love them

1876.32 --> 1884.3
in some way you know I can't this

1882.32 --> 1887.72
absolutely I could never have sex with

1884.3 --> 1891.97
somebody that I wouldn't love that or

1887.72 --> 1891.97
that wouldn't want that

1893.97 --> 1901.3600000000001
but yeah that doesn't mean that you just

1897.73 --> 1904.33
should never have sex and only have sex

1901.36 --> 1907.36
when you're really like going to attempt

1904.33 --> 1909.82
to make a baby necessarily I don't agree

1907.36 --> 1912.1599999999999
to that you know there is love there is

1909.82 --> 1917.2
a lot of magic there and it's a bonding

1912.16 --> 1919.8400000000001
effect too there's so much that good

1917.2 --> 1924.52
that can come from from it as long as

1919.84 --> 1927.85
you let it be secondary to the spiritual

1924.52 --> 1932.86
process and not primary if the sex

1927.85 --> 1936.6899999999998
itself becomes so much about just yes

1932.86 --> 1939.25
squirting then eventually the physical

1936.69 --> 1941.5
process and basically the hormonal

1939.25 --> 1943.78
released the drugs that come with that

1941.5 --> 1946.57
they become the focus because the

1943.78 --> 1948.94
spiritual side effects will wear off the

1946.57 --> 1951.85
magic of it will truly wear off and then

1948.94 --> 1955.3
you degrade then you start to degrade to

1951.85 --> 1958.36
sex addiction because it wears you out

1955.3 --> 1961.84
it drains you see that's the difference

1958.36 --> 1963.52
but if you can't control it if you can

1961.84 --> 1967.23
just be responsible if you can both

1963.52 --> 1971.31
realize it then you could have sex every

1967.23 --> 1974.92
now and then and some days maybe a lot

1971.31 --> 1978.1299999999999
depending it's a testing process too you

1974.92 --> 1980.71
just got to figure out like are we are

1978.13 --> 1984.8200000000002
we losing it because of what we're doing

1980.71 --> 1988.24
are we losing our energy should we doing

1984.82 --> 1991.72
something else instead of this you know

1988.24 --> 1993.7
you gotta keep testing it you gotta keep

1991.72 --> 1995.73
testing it always especially if it's

1993.7 --> 2003.0800000000002
just if it's fantastic

1995.73 --> 2003.08
with each other anyway

2004.05 --> 2012.37
that's just yeah just let it be natural

2006.88 --> 2014.94
and let the frequency be the primary

2012.37 --> 2014.9399999999998
concern

2021.419 --> 2028.919
once you start using toys and stuff I

2024.149 --> 2038.5189999999998
don't know Voynich in a way you're

2028.919 --> 2042.239
you're probably right it's not something

2038.519 --> 2044.909
that I would encourage but I don't know

2042.239 --> 2048.2400000000002
sometimes it could be interest it really

2044.909 --> 2049.9500000000003
all depends and what few are you gonna

2048.24 --> 2052.589
get out of it with the person that does

2049.95 --> 2058.0789999999997
that and do they do it really because

2052.589 --> 2060.96
they're totally addicted because yeah

2058.079 --> 2065.19
some people I don't even want to get

2060.96 --> 2067.289
into it it's just that really it all

2065.19 --> 2070.98
depends on the person some people can

2067.289 --> 2078.5
just use all kinds of things and still

2070.98 --> 2078.5
not be sex addicts that's all I'm saying

2079.639 --> 2083.4190000000003
next topic right

2092.76 --> 2097.15
yeah surprise surprise I got a lot of

2095.65 --> 2098.07
money and suddenly it's talking about

2097.15 --> 2114.57
sex

2098.07 --> 2119.59
hmm don't have that much money anyway

2114.57 --> 2121.81
anyway hey Karen B you showed up on an

2119.59 --> 2124.17
interesting day oh you came in right at

2121.81 --> 2129.67
the right moment did you

2124.17 --> 2132.36
next topic drugs really what about it

2129.67 --> 2136.81
it's pretty much the same thing you know

2132.36 --> 2141.4
sex and drugs and potentially music as

2136.81 --> 2146.98
well they can all be addictive like I

2141.4 --> 2149.17
have music addictions as well but I've

2146.98 --> 2151.6
just been very careful with it and

2149.17 --> 2157.03
because it never gets entangled to it

2151.6 --> 2160.8399999999997
like unrest because of money because

2157.03 --> 2163.09
music is free for me it's absolutely

2160.84 --> 2166.27
it's become free I've spent plenty of

2163.09 --> 2169.06
money on music but it's now just free

2166.27 --> 2172.36
with YouTube you know and I've got so

2169.06 --> 2174.0099999999998
many beautiful songs now and I but I

2172.36 --> 2176.65
have to be careful with it because if it

2174.01 --> 2180.1600000000003
just put on that music like hours on end

2176.65 --> 2184.86
I'll just so completely I'll lose my

2180.16 --> 2189.16
mind because it's so impressive to me

2184.86 --> 2192.82
it's really like a magic potion so it's

2189.16 --> 2195.73
yeah sex drugs and rock and roll they

2192.82 --> 2201.94
say it's all it can all be very

2195.73 --> 2205.8
addictive for me at least I guess I'm a

2201.94 --> 2205.8
sex drugs and rock and roll kind of guy

2206.16 --> 2214.2599999999998
although I had not recorded just because

2209.41 --> 2214.2599999999998
of the same music

2216.839 --> 2229.479
I'm more into a melodic trance type

2222.069 --> 2234.069
things and folk and classic and but all

2229.479 --> 2243.459
very specific and often melodic melody

2234.069 --> 2245.5589999999997
is everything yes x-direction

2243.459 --> 2247.019
rock'n'roll was created by toughest talk

2245.559 --> 2251.289
yeah

2247.019 --> 2254.859
not surprised well I'm a little to have

2251.289 --> 2262.509
a stock plant because I've been racing

2254.859 --> 2264.489
that [ __ ] like yeah my mother was all

2262.509 --> 2268.529
about yeah she's a music teacher and

2264.489 --> 2271.66
hippie and also a bit of botanist I

2268.529 --> 2276.91
really appreciated that part especially

2271.66 --> 2279.069
and yeah they were my parents were kind

2276.91 --> 2284.3799999999997
of sexually liberal they were not

2279.069 --> 2287.589
secretive about it and so yeah they've

2284.38 --> 2293.529
been just drenched in that you know

2287.589 --> 2297.999
liberal but still yeah not like liberal

2293.529 --> 2307.029
not modern-day liberal but still yeah

2297.999 --> 2312.7889999999998
the few steps before that so yeah it's

2307.029 --> 2318.9
it's been ingrained in me in a way and I

2312.789 --> 2321.3390000000004
can deal with it and I guess that also

2318.9 --> 2323.949
unfortunately will typically draw me

2321.339 --> 2328.8089999999997
towards people that are on the bad

2323.949 --> 2329.199
spectrum of that maybe but you know what

2328.809 --> 2331.719
that is

2329.199 --> 2333.88
it's weird because it nan this kind of

2331.719 --> 2335.92
[ __ ] has happened to me before when it

2333.88 --> 2338.079
then start to do what I started I get

2335.92 --> 2339.759
this calling like I want to pull them

2338.079 --> 2345.7290000000003
out I want to pull them out of the

2339.759 --> 2347.85
darkness it's a it's a very dangerous

2345.729 --> 2353.43
impulse

2347.85 --> 2353.43
sometimes got me into a lot of trouble

2353.55 --> 2359.17
my mother plays very good Street that's

2356.71 --> 2363.79
not my mother playing that now that's

2359.17 --> 2369.91
that's a man that's a man baby no my

2363.79 --> 2378.1
mother composed that on the piano by the

2369.91 --> 2379.18
way my mother was a composer and the

2378.1 --> 2382.18
music teacher

2379.18 --> 2388.75
like she wrote a book he wrote book

2382.18 --> 2391.4199999999996
theoretics it's very very well-respected

2388.75 --> 2393.61
she gave everything to that probably her

2391.42 --> 2397.05
life because she it stressed her out so

2393.61 --> 2400.48
bad and she just go for it anyway and

2397.05 --> 2402.94
unfortunately we also got the full win

2400.48 --> 2406.0
of the stress of that over at the family

2402.94 --> 2409.15
sometimes up to totally unreasonable

2406.0 --> 2411.91
levels but we kind of like endured it

2409.15 --> 2418.869
because it's like she's she was doing

2411.91 --> 2420.94
something big trying to upholding things

2418.869 --> 2423.1000000000004
that are like really effective and that

2420.94 --> 2425.65
they was doing a lot of good it seemed

2423.1 --> 2427.47
to at least but it was more than she

2425.65 --> 2430.51
could handle

2427.47 --> 2433.6299999999997
so she was like teetering we all had to

2430.51 --> 2443.4
like help her prevent exploding from the

2433.63 --> 2443.4
stress it's crazy now I'm talking 90s

2461.039 --> 2464.039
morality

2482.67 --> 2488.75
okay talking about music I see right

2533.65 --> 2540.34
yeah singing I like singing too but I'm

2536.83 --> 2545.95
very shy if I sing I want it to be so

2540.34 --> 2547.6000000000004
perfect that people just cannot be I'd

2545.95 --> 2549.73
like to sing along with things I don't

2547.6 --> 2553.45
like to sing alone standing it just

2549.73 --> 2555.88
makes me very very nervous and I think

2553.45 --> 2558.52
that I'm halfway decent in certain type

2555.88 --> 2561.0
of situations but I'd like to see if

2558.52 --> 2564.87
there's like songs and there is like a

2561.0 --> 2567.31
melody or usually a bassline that's

2564.87 --> 2575.92
perfect in my vocal range that I get

2567.31 --> 2584.2
then I'll sing along with it or up and

2575.92 --> 2585.79
I'll do it perfectly because if I

2584.2 --> 2589.1499999999996
wouldn't do it perfectly I would not

2585.79 --> 2594.22
dare to screw up the song you know with

2589.15 --> 2596.32
my verbal whatever yeah and I think I'm

2594.22 --> 2601.93
getting a more getting more bass in my

2596.32 --> 2606.76
voice it's interesting like I used to

2601.93 --> 2608.3199999999997
like want to be able to get out of good

2606.76 --> 2613.09
bass mmm

2608.32 --> 2615.76
like that tone but it would be rough on

2613.09 --> 2620.1400000000003
my vocals but it seems like it's kind of

2615.76 --> 2622.9300000000003
shifting so I guess that had the older I

2620.14 --> 2626.02
get the more bass I will get in my voice

2622.93 --> 2628.44
I can't I have to say I kind of like

2626.02 --> 2628.44
that

2631.7 --> 2648.819
oh dear its mr. squared about dude

2673.0 --> 2682.45
uh hmm interesting dank that's

2678.28 --> 2685.75
interesting you feel bad for Greta

2682.45 --> 2688.0899999999997
senior on a sailing laughs vagabond to

2685.75 --> 2690.82
youtube she's literally just a little

2688.09 --> 2698.44
kid being forced into her stance I don't

2690.82 --> 2700.4500000000003
think so I don't think so I think she

2698.44 --> 2705.1
really wants this I think this is like

2700.45 --> 2708.93
she's in a dream and she's just kind of

2705.1 --> 2708.93
like stuck in that dream too

2709.65 --> 2716.56
and it's with how dare you

2713.82 --> 2719.76
it's where to because she's getting a

2716.56 --> 2723.25
bit older and like you can really see

2719.76 --> 2727.57
what she's gonna be like what type of

2723.25 --> 2732.78
like how her build is gonna turn out is

2727.57 --> 2735.4300000000003
she such a Greta it's incredible like

2732.78 --> 2738.73
yeah she is Greta

2735.43 --> 2743.8799999999997
but before Greta Thornburg was a thing

2738.73 --> 2748.33
there was a concept like a Greta or yeah

2743.88 --> 2751.42
there's like types that then get names

2748.33 --> 2753.45
and yeah it's I guess it's all the rage

2751.42 --> 2753.4500000000003
now

2755.49 --> 2764.0499999999997
but Greta is like the ultimate Greta I

2758.86 --> 2765.88
don't know if that makes any sense it's

2764.05 --> 2772.6000000000004
almost like she's the culmination of

2765.88 --> 2773.37
that that folklore stereotype it's so

2772.6 --> 2777.0099999999998
weird

2773.37 --> 2778.42
is it an even folklore I don't know

2777.01 --> 2785.2000000000003
maybe I'm just being really confused

2778.42 --> 2788.65
right now backstory and Greta's family

2785.2 --> 2793.5299999999997
yeah it's no good it's very gravelled

2788.65 --> 2793.53
family ultra-liberal

2802.02 --> 2806.71
yeah that's not gonna be good for you

2804.369 --> 2807.54
when you're you know just think of it

2806.71 --> 2811.569
like this

2807.54 --> 2814.089
you it's not even their evil and they

2811.569 --> 2817.5099999999998
are after the arson just think about it

2814.089 --> 2819.19
if both your parents are actors what

2817.51 --> 2822.099
kind of a relationship are going to they

2819.19 --> 2824.7400000000002
gonna have with one another especially

2822.099 --> 2829.8
if they're like really good actors you

2824.74 --> 2834.2099999999996
know they're like really into that then

2829.8 --> 2837.73
do they have that because of escapism

2834.21 --> 2839.8
like they might be like a family of very

2837.73 --> 2844.78
strong dreamers that have used their

2839.8 --> 2847.42
Dreaming Ness to act but then that means

2844.78 --> 2849.94
they're all constantly probably in stock

2847.42 --> 2852.52
of Luc's of denial and none of they

2849.94 --> 2854.9500000000003
can't help each other with that so they

2852.52 --> 2856.15
get dragged down because of like they're

2854.95 --> 2861.0299999999997
all in denial

2856.15 --> 2865.69
constantly it's like the whole family

2861.03 --> 2868.5690000000004
they don't because of their escapism and

2865.69 --> 2871.27
yeah doubling down on that with acting

2868.569 --> 2872.95
they all get stuck in their escapist

2871.27 --> 2874.96
mode and then they get dragged into

2872.95 --> 2877.21
things and they they don't have the

2874.96 --> 2881.44
cohesion probably anymore among one

2877.21 --> 2883.69
another like it's become too easy to act

2881.44 --> 2886.059
your way out of a social situation in

2883.69 --> 2889.869
the face of one another and they'll

2886.059 --> 2891.88
probably start to like make like okay

2889.869 --> 2895.3900000000003
I'm not gonna bother you if you're not

2891.88 --> 2897.849
gonna bother me type of deals right

2895.39 --> 2901.109
which you absolutely shouldn't do with

2897.849 --> 2905.77
your kids especially or with your spouse

2901.109 --> 2908.799
or maybe you sometimes you should but

2905.77 --> 2911.349
not in these like overlooking each

2908.799 --> 2913.48
other's flaws and [ __ ] when you should

2911.349 --> 2915.6600000000003
really be working on it type of that

2913.48 --> 2918.46
that you shouldn't do that in my opinion

2915.66 --> 2922.1189999999997
but they probably will now I'm I'm

2918.46 --> 2924.4
dividing this I'm dividing this based on

2922.119 --> 2925.9
the presupposition that they are actors

2924.4 --> 2927.28
and that they're probably like her

2925.9 --> 2931.23
dreamers

2927.28 --> 2934.3900000000003
I have looked at Greta and she really

2931.23 --> 2939.87
believes what she says because she's a

2934.39 --> 2943.81
real dreamer and she's a bit nutty and

2939.87 --> 2946.75
so I'm going by that data that sensory

2943.81 --> 2950.47
data and I'm trying to reconstruct based

2946.75 --> 2952.9
going off the what people said in chat

2950.47 --> 2956.7099999999996
that her family is a family of actors

2952.9 --> 2958.81
and then just trying to construct what's

2956.71 --> 2963.16
probably going on there and what got

2958.81 --> 2973.18
them to this position see great Iceman

2963.16 --> 2977.98
of the virus but yeah I'm completely

2973.18 --> 2980.56
defining it you know maybe maybe they

2977.98 --> 2983.62
did get maybe the her parents are much

2980.56 --> 2986.47
stronger in character and they might

2983.62 --> 2990.13
just be very politically zealous just

2986.47 --> 2991.8399999999997
very dedicated liberals that could be

2990.13 --> 2993.9700000000003
the case too they could just be

2991.84 --> 2997.36
completely brainwashed social justice

2993.97 --> 2999.8799999999997
warriors and yeah once you go as a

2997.36 --> 3003.9
family to that once you adopt that

2999.88 --> 3005.4
system as your family based standard you

3003.9 --> 3013.35
got a problem that's never going to be

3005.4 --> 3015.59
solved until the family breaks so that

3013.35 --> 3019.74
could also be the case that that's

3015.59 --> 3023.25
dominating much for more than any type

3019.74 --> 3027.72
of personal subtle situation concerning

3023.25 --> 3030.86
their character so yeah that that's my

3027.72 --> 3030.8599999999997
definition for the day

3046.279 --> 3054.809
right yeah it was kind of creepy

3052.859 --> 3058.8289999999997
my mother was kind of dragged into

3054.809 --> 3064.3190000000004
social justice as well at some point and

3058.829 --> 3068.73
I recognized it in her and like what it

3064.319 --> 3071.099
was doing and I really basically told

3068.73 --> 3074.789
like really dominantly totally like you

3071.099 --> 3076.799
must stop this this is you have no idea

3074.789 --> 3079.71
what you're engaging in it's very

3076.799 --> 3083.22
dangerous and my brother agreed like

3079.71 --> 3084.93
thankfully my brother agreed with like I

3083.22 --> 3087.8999999999996
was in a well enough position even

3084.93 --> 3092.819
though I was like a liberal myself but I

3087.9 --> 3095.4900000000002
tried like no I'm gonna restore it that

3092.819 --> 3099.779
was my idea in a way like ah there's

3095.49 --> 3104.8799999999997
social justice is bad there must be some

3099.779 --> 3107.4
way to restore this but my mother was

3104.88 --> 3109.94
getting into that like in the 90s even

3107.4 --> 3112.88
when it wasn't even all that widespread

3109.94 --> 3119.9700000000003
when it wasn't being popularized yet or

3112.88 --> 3126.329
integrated into school programs well but

3119.97 --> 3131.24
yeah once one social justice works its

3126.329 --> 3134.6600000000003
way into family culture it's [ __ ]

3131.24 --> 3134.66
absolutely [ __ ]

3167.34 --> 3173.4
bottom line Greta wanted her mommy to

3169.68 --> 3184.02
come home make her dinner that's that's

3173.4 --> 3186.7200000000003
adorable it's it's true it's true I did

3184.02 --> 3189.54
that's a big you are so on target with

3186.72 --> 3193.23
that Missouri bear because you can see

3189.54 --> 3194.88
it too in her eyes sometimes like in the

3193.23 --> 3198.81
in-between moments that she's basically

3194.88 --> 3207.81
like waiting for when when can I finally

3198.81 --> 3211.5499999999997
come home like yeah you really caught up

3207.81 --> 3214.0499999999997
on something there it made me remember

3211.55 --> 3216.6800000000003
from seeing just footage of her

3214.05 --> 3224.8500000000004
especially when she's not speaking that

3216.68 --> 3235.5299999999997
she's like like feeling alone like she

3224.85 --> 3239.42
longs for the love of her parents if I

3235.53 --> 3239.42
do this can I come home wow that's

3239.98 --> 3254.57
yeah it also depends on who she is as a

3251.42 --> 3256.82
person you know I think that she's being

3254.57 --> 3262.07
put down as this really adventurous type

3256.82 --> 3264.26
but is she or is she since like where

3262.07 --> 3266.57
does she live and all that maybe she's

3264.26 --> 3270.26
not really that and in fact it's maybe

3266.57 --> 3272.1800000000003
she just thinks she's an adventurous

3270.26 --> 3274.7900000000004
type because she's really young but

3272.18 --> 3281.93
maybe she's really like what do you call

3274.79 --> 3287.18
it a stay at home bird type of guy type

3281.93 --> 3289.94
of girl because yeah of course as her

3287.18 --> 3292.97
character in the media that the face the

3289.94 --> 3294.68
media represent you're in go all over

3292.97 --> 3297.83
the world but maybe she doesn't really

3294.68 --> 3299.66
like it after all she's just thought she

3297.83 --> 3301.91
liked it and now she's just going along

3299.66 --> 3307.1
because of like oh she wants the fame

3301.91 --> 3308.93
and the money and but maybe she is

3307.1 --> 3313.8399999999997
constantly just thinking like I wish I

3308.93 --> 3318.2799999999997
was just home at my at my bed and just

3313.84 --> 3318.28
like that I didn't know

3324.51 --> 3331.1800000000003
right and she has depression issues but

3327.25 --> 3337.11
that's probably just I don't know I did

3331.18 --> 3344.91
it's probably not because off it's very

3337.11 --> 3348.67
common in yeah in the northern regions

3344.91 --> 3350.95
so that's on top of that and that that

3348.67 --> 3357.76
type of depression typically wants you

3350.95 --> 3360.7599999999998
to be just home just safe and not a lot

3357.76 --> 3365.86
of issues around you that type of

3360.76 --> 3367.63
depression I think and if you can't get

3365.86 --> 3375.1600000000003
that then you can turn into like a

3367.63 --> 3377.59
raging maniac so maybe he's shown some

3375.16 --> 3379.5099999999998
of that I don't know died except just

3377.59 --> 3383.8900000000003
purely speculating you know I haven't

3379.51 --> 3388.9500000000003
even thought why would I follow her

3383.89 --> 3393.96
that's like almost creepy it's like it's

3388.95 --> 3393.96
it's basically just a media stunt

3401.249 --> 3409.049
but in in a way I do find it kind of

3404.589 --> 3412.599
fascinating but just yeah as a situation

3409.049 --> 3417.9
to figure it out what's going on there

3412.599 --> 3417.9
behind the camera and in the media front

3433.01 --> 3438.55
I wouldn't defend Greta if I was the

3435.26 --> 3438.55
best lawyer in the world really

3447.27 --> 3456.24
well it depends defender for what you

3450.99 --> 3459.0499999999997
know it would depend what she got

3456.24 --> 3459.0499999999997
herself into

3477.74 --> 3490.4599999999996
really how what what okay now I'm not

3488.48 --> 3493.31
even trying to slap you around or

3490.46 --> 3500.93
something with this what what do you

3493.31 --> 3504.32
mean exactly are you talking about like

3500.93 --> 3506.93
how she is performing as a person taking

3504.32 --> 3509.53
away of what the effective thing is

3506.93 --> 3513.5299999999997
she's doing just like how she's

3509.53 --> 3515.8100000000004
upholding herself or are you actually

3513.53 --> 3523.63
agreeing with the Greta Thornburg agenda

3515.81 --> 3523.63
that's now what kind of freaked me out

3525.339 --> 3531.79
putting climate on the Jo my god oh my

3529.25 --> 3531.79
god really

3534.49 --> 3539.9599999999996
but how is the climate being put on the

3537.77 --> 3543.8
agenda exactly because I think there's

3539.96 --> 3546.95
just a whole lot of nonsense that's

3543.8 --> 3550.01
being inserted into the environmentalism

3546.95 --> 3554.359
situation because all this all this

3550.01 --> 3558.2000000000003
climate change nonsense is not helping

3554.359 --> 3563.45
it's not helping anything it's not

3558.2 --> 3567.339
helping in the environment at all no it

3563.45 --> 3571.48
would be much better if we just relay

3567.339 --> 3573.58
the climate or what is it the

3571.48 --> 3577.88
environmentalism to focus more on

3573.58 --> 3583.69
getting pollution out out of industry

3577.88 --> 3587.7200000000003
out of the environments in every way and

3583.69 --> 3590.4500000000003
like also just figure out how to perfect

3587.72 --> 3592.3999999999996
recycling like how can we neutralize

3590.45 --> 3595.609
certain oxygen toxins suppose

3592.4 --> 3598.88
potentially that like otherwise would

3595.609 --> 3601.339
have to be stored and are dangerous like

3598.88 --> 3605.98
this is should be real environmentalism

3601.339 --> 3609.74
is just neutralizing poison in every way

3605.98 --> 3611.15
that should be environmentalism make

3609.74 --> 3616.25
nature thrive

3611.15 --> 3620.63
again get the crap the craps not even

3616.25 --> 3625.52
but get the the chemicals out of the

3620.63 --> 3629.02
rivers somehow and then yeah the more

3625.52 --> 3631.61
you do that the more food you got and

3629.02 --> 3633.5
the more cleared up people will be the

3631.61 --> 3636.26
more sensible people will become the

3633.5 --> 3639.58
less distracted by nonsense people will

3636.26 --> 3644.8300000000004
become and that will just create harmony

3639.58 --> 3644.83
between people in nature naturally

3646.48 --> 3655.94
things will stabilize I think because

3653.39 --> 3660.62
the real like population booms really

3655.94 --> 3663.68
are a reaction to its yeah it's like a

3660.62 --> 3669.22
bloom just like trees something or

3663.68 --> 3669.22
plants bloom when they get very damaged

3669.31 --> 3675.17
because it's like yeah they have to like

3673.19 --> 3678.71
there there is a threat to their

3675.17 --> 3681.2000000000003
existence so they have to like multiply

3678.71 --> 3685.13
they have to go towards multiplication

3681.2 --> 3689.24
because there is now a threat and that's

3685.13 --> 3692.51
really what population booms are they're

3689.24 --> 3695.18
our response to imbalance so an attack

3692.51 --> 3697.88
could be environmental attacked you know

3695.18 --> 3701.39
it's just a sudden terrible [ __ ] going

3697.88 --> 3702.77
on then they're sitting through and then

3701.39 --> 3704.5699999999997
as soon as there's an opportunity it's

3702.77 --> 3707.74
kind of population boom because of all

3704.57 --> 3712.19
the deaths and all that's what happens

3707.74 --> 3715.64
so if you smooth out the environment get

3712.19 --> 3719.06
all the poison out get that level of

3715.64 --> 3721.67
burden away people clear up become more

3719.06 --> 3725.48
sensible wisdom will integrate much

3721.67 --> 3728.9
better lies will be dispelled much

3725.48 --> 3737.41
easier by everyone and balance will form

3728.9 --> 3739.67
people real one two just yet do it right

3737.41 --> 3743.859
naturally because it's better for them

3739.67 --> 3747.799
and for everyone it'll be harmony

3743.859 --> 3751.97
it's possible I know maybe I'm being a

3747.799 --> 3754.94
bit idealistic here maybe this is my

3751.97 --> 3757.3689999999997
environmental dream of paradise take all

3754.94 --> 3760.579
the poison away but on the other hand

3757.369 --> 3764.7400000000002
even if I see it like an ideology dream

3760.579 --> 3768.799
like that it's gonna be an ongoing job

3764.74 --> 3770.9599999999996
until the end of time because every time

3768.799 --> 3773.089
something new is being used or being

3770.96 --> 3776.079
figured out and new materials are being

3773.089 --> 3779.299
there's always new environmental

3776.079 --> 3783.289
consequences that have to then be taken

3779.299 --> 3789.2
into account and worked on that's kind

3783.289 --> 3794.42
of yeah part of my personal dream for

3789.2 --> 3796.73
the world I guess anyway I'm gonna round

3794.42 --> 3798.7400000000002
out the show it was a great show I think

3796.73 --> 3800.9900000000002

3798.74 --> 3803.74
