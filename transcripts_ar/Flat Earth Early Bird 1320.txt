152.8 --> 158.31900000000002
warm

154.239 --> 158.31900000000002

160.879 --> 167.28

237.76 --> 240.76
so

244.0 --> 247.84
a pretty late night last night i was

246.4 --> 251.59900000000002
really restless

247.84 --> 251.599
still feel it a bit but just

253.28 --> 256.64
i was really restless

257.359 --> 259.68

259.84 --> 264.0
but yeah i still managed to sleep very

261.759 --> 264.0
well

266.24 --> 271.759
and yeah flat side made it

269.199 --> 273.84000000000003

the gofundme all together

276.24 --> 282.72
for his new computer that's cool

280.0 --> 284.4
i hope he gets like the whole processor

282.72 --> 285.84000000000003
thing in order that he was talking about

284.4 --> 288.0
though

285.84 --> 290.0
because yeah

288.0 --> 292.32
you do really need that

290.0 --> 295.32
anyway

292.32 --> 295.32
uh

298.4 --> 305.35999999999996
all right but i stayed up till like four

302.479 --> 307.59999999999997
just like way too late for me

305.36 --> 307.6
but

308.32 --> 312.44
yeah the fed

310.96 --> 315.12
premiere

312.44 --> 316.71999999999997
1689 it was just really it was a good

315.12 --> 319.199
stream

316.72 --> 322.08000000000004
and it was nathan streamed that

319.199 --> 322.08
extremely late

322.72 --> 330.0
that's sit now

325.44 --> 330.0
like starting at two o'clock at night

330.8 --> 334.32
and it was a pretty long

332.96 --> 336.23999999999995
show as well

334.32 --> 337.68
didn't yeah i had to step away

336.24 --> 339.759
eventually i'm not gonna like keep

337.68 --> 342.8
watching until five o'clock

339.759 --> 344.47900000000004
right also yeah ball busters live

342.8 --> 346.08
that was fun

344.479 --> 348.08
had very little to do with the

346.08 --> 350.08
scientific method actually

348.08 --> 351.59999999999997
but we all we were just having a

350.08 --> 355.28
community

351.6 --> 356.8
related and psychology conversation and

355.28 --> 358.23999999999995
yeah was

356.8 --> 361.039
we're all in good spirit it was good to

358.24 --> 361.039
be on the panel

361.919 --> 366.479
you know i mostly hung hung back in the

364.319 --> 367.68
background

366.479 --> 370.08
i thought it was a really good ball

367.68 --> 373.12
buster show

370.08 --> 373.12
in high spirits

373.68 --> 376.68
uh

386.479 --> 391.52
hey mike's image

388.63 --> 393.28
[Music]

391.52 --> 395.039
all right so i think i'll be stretching

393.28 --> 396.71999999999997
a lot because i think yeah with this

395.039 --> 399.44
moist

396.72 --> 402.639
and all that i don't know

399.44 --> 402.639
having like some weird

402.72 --> 408.40000000000003
cramping up of certain muscles

405.52 --> 410.4
in like the last three days

408.4 --> 412.23999999999995
i mean there's always a little but just

410.4 --> 414.23999999999995
last three days it's been just a

412.24 --> 416.56
nuisance

414.24 --> 418.639
and like thinking about like oh what

416.56 --> 420.88
would it be like if i like went to some

418.639 --> 422.96000000000004
masseuse or something

420.88 --> 425.759
would they be able to actually help me

422.96 --> 427.44
out here because i am a pretty decent

425.759 --> 430.0
masseur myself

427.44 --> 432.24
and i can effectively use one half of my

430.0 --> 433.599
body to massage the other half it works

432.24 --> 436.96000000000004
really well

433.599 --> 438.639
and it's like a special trick

436.96 --> 440.96
yeah

438.639 --> 443.52
i have to like compartmentalize some

440.96 --> 446.479
energies in the body to do that i can do

443.52 --> 449.35999999999996
that i trained that

446.479 --> 451.12
i'm like extremely self-sufficient this

449.36 --> 453.199
is

451.12 --> 455.199
maybe a little bit too self-sufficient

453.199 --> 456.8
so it's like yeah oh wow i'm so good at

455.199 --> 458.8
being a hermit

456.8 --> 462.319
unfortunately though that means i'm

458.8 --> 466.56
really good at being a hermit

462.319 --> 466.56
you know what i mean uh

468.96 --> 475.12
i'm not technically i have a daily show

473.44 --> 477.28
i'm not really even that much of a

475.12 --> 479.28000000000003
hermit it's just that

477.28 --> 481.84
i've got a lot of skills that can make

479.28 --> 483.35999999999996
me survive very eloquently like even if

481.84 --> 485.19899999999996
i'm like

483.36 --> 487.759
everybody for some reason turns their

485.199 --> 487.759
back on me

489.12 --> 494.639
yeah but that

491.039 --> 497.039
does not effectively count for this show

494.639 --> 499.36
because this show like i can't afford

497.039 --> 501.52
for you guys to turn your back on me of

499.36 --> 504.639
course

501.52 --> 504.639
because i need funding

505.68 --> 508.0
i'm not gonna

506.96 --> 510.71999999999997
[ __ ]

508.0 --> 510.72
because of that

510.879 --> 516.32
principle first

512.88 --> 519.32
honesty truth and like honest criticism

516.32 --> 519.32
correction

520.959 --> 524.959
and that's what you guys also like me

523.2 --> 527.12
for i hope

524.959 --> 529.5189999999999
and not just

527.12 --> 531.68
my sharp analysis in certain moments and

529.519 --> 535.48
my rage win

531.68 --> 535.4799999999999
passion in others

535.6 --> 539.519
anyway i don't know what i'm talking

537.279 --> 539.519
about

543.2 --> 549.08
you saw me on nathan's and was gonna

545.2 --> 549.08
tell me to go to bed yeah

551.839 --> 554.24
i did

556.56 --> 562.56
i was just restless and i i like i was

559.36 --> 564.48
just like wanna it's like that sort of

562.56 --> 566.7199999999999
restlessness that a lot of people would

564.48 --> 568.16
take as a starting signal like i want to

566.72 --> 571.0400000000001
go out

568.16 --> 572.48
just dance somewhere with people around

571.04 --> 574.3199999999999
when they're like that kind of restless

572.48 --> 577.12
i was that kind of restless and i kind

574.32 --> 580.0
of used the fpd premiere

577.12 --> 583.24
that later just like

580.0 --> 583.24
do stuff

593.279 --> 599.64
at first i thought it was a crime

595.519 --> 599.64
investigation show huh

605.2 --> 609.76
well

606.0 --> 611.76
it almost is becoming like that isn't it

609.76 --> 614.16
in a way with the anti-flat earth that's

611.76 --> 616.48
really funny that you call it that a

614.16 --> 620.48
crime investigation show

616.48 --> 623.44
ball busters fighting intellectual crime

620.48 --> 623.44
around the plane

624.399 --> 632.0
or around the globe but that would be

627.68 --> 635.0
a weird double speed twist

632.0 --> 635.0
hmm

641.41 --> 644.4499999999999
[Music]

654.72 --> 658.6
within the realm right

663.44 --> 667.12
it is kind of funny though because

665.839 --> 670.0
sometimes

667.12 --> 672.079
it does almost feel a bit like me and

670.0 --> 675.519
nathan and the guys

672.079 --> 678.399
like wear a pack of dogs

675.519 --> 680.5600000000001
and we're like being trained to be like

678.399 --> 682.16
police dogs and

680.56 --> 683.76
and to sniff out

682.16 --> 685.6
fallacies and

683.76 --> 688.16
double speak and all that

685.6 --> 690.24
right it it really does feel in so many

688.16 --> 693.519
ways like we are almost like

690.24 --> 693.519
police dogs or something

693.6 --> 698.16
the constant discipline and just the

695.839 --> 700.1600000000001
high tension snappiness and

698.16 --> 701.36
but still like taking things very

700.16 --> 704.4699999999999
serious

701.36 --> 705.6800000000001
that's police dog like

704.47 --> 708.399
[Music]

705.68 --> 708.399
it's funny

709.68 --> 714.4799999999999
hey splatter sage good to see you pjc

712.16 --> 714.48
net

724.24 --> 729.32
anyway i'm gonna try to take it a bit

725.92 --> 729.3199999999999
easy today

730.32 --> 732.5600000000001
well

733.12 --> 736.0
i don't know if i'm gonna succeed at

734.639 --> 739.48
that but

736.0 --> 739.48
i'm gonna try

755.519 --> 761.2
oh by the way

757.44 --> 762.8800000000001
this probably slipped by a lot of people

761.2 --> 765.2
because there was just a lot of stuff

762.88 --> 768.56
going down did anybody see like that

765.2 --> 773.839
video jim bob uploaded

768.56 --> 773.8389999999999
like roughly 16 hours ago hilarious

774.0 --> 776.959
hilarious

777.2 --> 782.1600000000001
just how does he pick up on these like

779.6 --> 784.8000000000001
where does he find these people

782.16 --> 786.48
how does he get there

784.8 --> 788.7199999999999
it's

786.48 --> 791.36
pretty amazing so yeah check it out it's

788.72 --> 794.5600000000001
a very short video

791.36 --> 797.6
uh one minute 70 seconds

794.56 --> 801.6389999999999
but it's amazing trust me watch it all

797.6 --> 801.639
the way through it's amazing

805.82 --> 809.6
[Music]

806.959 --> 812.0
like weird at fed we're not the only

809.6 --> 815.0400000000001
ones that are just dealing with complete

812.0 --> 818.32
delusional numpties

815.04 --> 818.3199999999999
it's so funny

819.199 --> 822.399
do i need any money to do the show today

821.519 --> 826.5600000000001
yeah

822.399 --> 826.56
yeah technically yes always

827.12 --> 832.639
i would definitely appreciate

830.48 --> 835.44
the paypal support although yesterday

832.639 --> 837.12
also in ball buster's chat somebody did

835.44 --> 839.12
also send me

837.12 --> 842.16
a paypal donation

839.12 --> 845.279
and i really appreciated that

842.16 --> 847.199
it's it's that's like really

845.279 --> 849.519
like almost weird but i'm really happy

847.199 --> 851.68
about it to like be in other places and

849.519 --> 854.72
then have people walk up to me like hey

851.68 --> 856.6389999999999
i want to donate that's like oh really

854.72 --> 858.32
that's awesome

856.639 --> 860.0790000000001
i really appreciate that

858.32 --> 864.0
what was his name again it wasn't

860.079 --> 864.0
somebody i like really knew or anything

864.079 --> 867.8389999999999
that's awesome

865.92 --> 870.16
i'm so happy that people out there that

867.839 --> 873.2790000000001
i've never even heard of like are really

870.16 --> 875.4399999999999
appreciating me and wanting to donate

873.279 --> 878.079
that's just

875.44 --> 879.7600000000001
exhilarating

878.079 --> 881.8389999999999
and gives me hope

879.76 --> 884.72
because yeah things are getting more

881.839 --> 887.0400000000001
expensive

884.72 --> 887.0400000000001
to me

888.72 --> 892.639
yes pgc knit i noticed i watched the

890.88 --> 894.56
part of that

892.639 --> 896.88
flat side it was very restless as well

894.56 --> 900.399
apparently

896.88 --> 900.399
streaming in the middle of the night

907.6 --> 913.44
right but it's like his celebratory

910.48 --> 914.88
stream that it succeeded and how quick

913.44 --> 919.1990000000001
was that

914.88 --> 919.199
i went how many it took less than a week

919.279 --> 923.279
half a week

920.959 --> 925.3599999999999
so yeah it's awesome i'm really happy

923.279 --> 927.12
for him i hope it does work out and it's

925.36 --> 929.92
not going to be going to turn into a

927.12 --> 929.92
mock-up because

931.44 --> 934.32
you know

932.32 --> 937.839
he's only going to be really there once

934.32 --> 940.24
he has an assembled working computer

937.839 --> 942.1600000000001
he's not there yet i really hope he

940.24 --> 943.92
knows what he's doing

942.16 --> 945.4399999999999
i mean computers can be tricky

943.92 --> 948.079
especially if you're going to try to

945.44 --> 950.24
assemble them from secondhand parts it's

948.079 --> 952.6389999999999
really difficult

950.24 --> 957.12
things don't always turn out to be very

952.639 --> 957.12
compatible there's you have to do like

957.6 --> 962.0790000000001
like meta research you have to go like

959.68 --> 964.8
tweakers and net of dotnet and try to

962.079 --> 967.4399999999999
see if you can con find

964.8 --> 969.68
like research about compatibility of the

967.44 --> 970.72
very specific systems you want to click

969.68 --> 972.56
together

970.72 --> 974.48
like you you kind of got to do that

972.56 --> 976.959
because otherwise it's like oh yeah this

974.48 --> 978.9590000000001
should oh this works perfectly click and

976.959 --> 980.6389999999999
then it's like

978.959 --> 982.6389999999999
and it just can't work

980.639 --> 984.16
and you don't know why

982.639 --> 986.639
it's really yeah

984.16 --> 989.759
building a pc can be tricky

986.639 --> 991.759
i'm always extremely careful and like

989.759 --> 993.6800000000001
even like with this motherboard that i

991.759 --> 995.839
had to replace

993.68 --> 999.279
i was like

995.839 --> 1002.0790000000001
like really nervous because i did not

999.279 --> 1003.8389999999999
have the luxury to pick

1002.079 --> 1006.079
and it was really like is this gonna

1003.839 --> 1007.839
work oh [ __ ] i hope this is gonna work

1006.079 --> 1010.7199999999999
it could turn like it could have been

1007.839 --> 1012.72
like i turn it on and then just like it

1010.72 --> 1016.639
fries the entire thing fried that could

1012.72 --> 1016.639
have happened you never really know

1017.36 --> 1022.24
for sure

1018.88 --> 1022.24
but i got really lucky

1022.72 --> 1028.24
eh

1025.6 --> 1030.1599999999999
my mouse computer computer my stuff that

1028.24 --> 1032.64
sucks

1030.16 --> 1036.64
you gotta clean it up though

1032.64 --> 1040.7990000000002
i mean if you clean your mouse properly

1036.64 --> 1040.7990000000002
you can do a very long time with it

1043.199 --> 1048.24
block of cheese as a mouse but that's

1045.679 --> 1051.5590000000002
just terrible

1048.24 --> 1051.559
hello cleary

1058.4 --> 1061.44
it will assemble the highest form of

1060.24 --> 1063.1200000000001
scientific

1061.44 --> 1066.1200000000001
you're in a bit of goofy mood today

1063.12 --> 1066.12
elise

1066.24 --> 1068.72
it's fine

1069.76 --> 1074.16
it's pretty old gotta buy new okay

1073.12 --> 1077.6
right

1074.16 --> 1077.6000000000001
yeah eventually they just

1077.919 --> 1081.64
it just wears out

1082.24 --> 1087.2
i prefer the types of mouse mice

1085.36 --> 1090.08
do you even call it that

1087.2 --> 1092.64
mice like this style

1090.08 --> 1095.28
where it's slightly asymmetrical

1092.64 --> 1097.679
and you have a laser

1095.28 --> 1099.2
laser director you got to keep that

1097.679 --> 1101.44
clean very carefully make sure it

1099.2 --> 1102.88
doesn't get cluttered

1101.44 --> 1105.039
and

1102.88 --> 1106.88
i had to actually this sounds weird i

1105.039 --> 1110.48
had i use

1106.88 --> 1114.24
an envelopes as a mouse pad because i've

1110.48 --> 1115.28
used it on this table so much

1114.24 --> 1117.84
that

1115.28 --> 1120.8799999999999
like it's literally like scratch micro

1117.84 --> 1123.36
scratch the surface and now it just

1120.88 --> 1125.5200000000002
it doesn't pick it up anymore

1123.36 --> 1127.28
really weird and technically it

1125.52 --> 1130.48
functions great and the buttons have

1127.28 --> 1133.2
been absolutely not jamming which so

1130.48 --> 1135.1200000000001
happy about so they use like the best

1133.2 --> 1137.8400000000001
type of clicky

1135.12 --> 1137.84
stuff for it

1138.16 --> 1141.679
that's usually where a mouse starts to

1140.4 --> 1144.0
[ __ ] up

1141.679 --> 1146.0800000000002
or at least they used to like around 10

1144.0 --> 1148.0
years ago and they might have literally

1146.08 --> 1150.799
upgraded

1148.0 --> 1153.039
standardized because yeah everybody

1150.799 --> 1154.559
hates it when their mouse just stops

1153.039 --> 1156.16
clicking

1154.559 --> 1158.3999999999999
then you can

1156.16 --> 1160.16
you know how that went

1158.4 --> 1161.6000000000001
but it hasn't happened to my mouse in a

1160.16 --> 1165.76
long time

1161.6 --> 1167.52
it does get cluttered a bit anyway

1165.76 --> 1170.64
exactly the moment i was opening

1167.52 --> 1170.6399999999999
photoshop to make it

1172.72 --> 1175.72
really

1181.44 --> 1184.44
wow

1196.4 --> 1201.3600000000001
and mice

1198.799 --> 1203.84
i think it's a high-end mouse but it's

1201.36 --> 1207.039
hilarious to actually

1203.84 --> 1210.3999999999999
see yeah

1207.039 --> 1212.72
now i i grew up with double click i mean

1210.4 --> 1214.799
single click that's such you're you must

1212.72 --> 1217.52
be you must have grown up like an apple

1214.799 --> 1219.36
guy then because apple always never had

1217.52 --> 1221.44
they never did that

1219.36 --> 1223.76
it was really the pc that did the double

1221.44 --> 1223.76
click

1225.44 --> 1229.76
and even amiga did it too by the way

1230.24 --> 1237.44
wait did they have a mouse on the media

1235.12 --> 1238.9599999999998
no i didn't ha

1237.44 --> 1241.1200000000001
yeah

1238.96 --> 1245.0
i almost forgot amiga didn't even use

1241.12 --> 1245.0
that he didn't need it

1248.08 --> 1254.96
you're working work in a computer shop

1250.4 --> 1256.5590000000002
oh yes of course i could would no

1254.96 --> 1258.4
no no dude

1256.559 --> 1259.84
the things that i know

1258.4 --> 1262.96
are basically

1259.84 --> 1264.9599999999998
like more historical archive material

1262.96 --> 1267.679
that's not gonna help in an actual

1264.96 --> 1269.2
computer shop because the computer shops

1267.679 --> 1271.919
are gonna have to deal with people that

1269.2 --> 1274.0
always want the new [ __ ] and all that

1271.919 --> 1276.159
or want something really complex and

1274.0 --> 1280.0
niche repaired

1276.159 --> 1282.48
that's not where i would be very good at

1280.0 --> 1286.159
especially like with the newest [ __ ] no

1282.48 --> 1286.159
i know about the old [ __ ]

1286.48 --> 1293.1200000000001
you could work in a library oh yes oh

1289.679 --> 1295.6000000000001
yeah hey hey maybe i could

1293.12 --> 1298.6399999999999
work on youtube

1295.6 --> 1301.6
with a daily show

1298.64 --> 1301.6000000000001
how about that

1303.44 --> 1307.1200000000001
right

1304.4 --> 1309.76
how about please stop trying to give me

1307.12 --> 1312.08
suggestions on what type of job to get

1309.76 --> 1315.559
other than doing this

1312.08 --> 1315.559
how about that

1319.84 --> 1322.48
oh jess

1322.72 --> 1326.76
is jeff here not yet

1334.159 --> 1337.6000000000001
that's right pjc net

1342.72 --> 1347.919
and the funny thing is because i know

1344.64 --> 1349.44
that so much tech guys end up really

1347.919 --> 1352.48
liking me

1349.44 --> 1355.1200000000001
because when i have computer problems i

1352.48 --> 1357.6
i get stressed out but i then don't

1355.12 --> 1359.76
blame the guy

1357.6 --> 1362.1589999999999
like a lot of people do

1359.76 --> 1364.1589999999999
i'm like i really get it and i like

1362.159 --> 1367.0390000000002
respect them

1364.159 --> 1369.44
as engineers

1367.039 --> 1372.48
and i have like reference material from

1369.44 --> 1374.72
my past to check out how sharp they

1372.48 --> 1377.1200000000001
really are i do like give them a little

1374.72 --> 1378.72
test i like start a little technical

1377.12 --> 1380.9599999999998
conversation

1378.72 --> 1380.96
like

1381.2 --> 1387.2
right to test them to see

1384.64 --> 1389.5200000000002
if they get flustered or if they like

1387.2 --> 1392.24
really actually know their [ __ ] and have

1389.52 --> 1393.44
like in in depth answers and the funny

1392.24 --> 1396.159
thing is

1393.44 --> 1398.24
i won't even really know what that is

1396.159 --> 1400.8400000000001
that they answer with but i will be able

1398.24 --> 1404.559
to tell if it's actually

1400.84 --> 1406.6399999999999
based in personal research based on

1404.559 --> 1409.039
their energy

1406.64 --> 1411.039
not on what they're saying but based on

1409.039 --> 1413.76
their energy it's what i do

1411.039 --> 1413.76
it's what i do

1415.2 --> 1417.8400000000001
but yeah

1423.52 --> 1430.12
something that tastes better

1426.64 --> 1430.1200000000001
oh god

1433.84 --> 1437.36
yeah dude

1436.159 --> 1439.6000000000001
just

1437.36 --> 1441.9189999999999
i don't want to do this today i was

1439.6 --> 1445.039
having a great show i don't need you

1441.919 --> 1447.2
guys to start nagging me

1445.039 --> 1449.039
i i'm not even in the mood to get pissed

1447.2 --> 1452.559
off over it i'm just gonna

1449.039 --> 1452.559
just swipe you to the side

1453.2 --> 1456.679
oh my god

1461.44 --> 1466.52
that's the hustle treating you same as

1463.52 --> 1466.52
always

1472.4 --> 1476.88
okay yeah yeah you don't

1475.12 --> 1478.7199999999998
do that

1476.88 --> 1480.72
don't say something

1478.72 --> 1482.64
and then remove it again and have that

1480.72 --> 1486.76
be the only thing you said yeah if you

1482.64 --> 1486.76
do that i will ban you

1508.08 --> 1513.8799999999999
hey

1510.0 --> 1513.88
talking about oh yeah computers

1520.08 --> 1524.32
right also by the way isn't it just

1522.64 --> 1526.72
weird like

1524.32 --> 1529.84
remember all those times that my mic or

1526.72 --> 1529.84
i mean that my

1530.0 --> 1534.799
my webcam like freezes up

1532.4 --> 1538.0
and then sometimes it does it like three

1534.799 --> 1540.24
four times in a row in one show

1538.0 --> 1542.32
and other times it just doesn't do it at

1540.24 --> 1543.84
all

1542.32 --> 1546.72
and like

1543.84 --> 1549.12
it just makes absolutely no logical

1546.72 --> 1551.6000000000001
consistent sense other than there is a

1549.12 --> 1554.9599999999998
spirit that is like

1551.6 --> 1556.9599999999998
pushing the energy one way or the other

1554.96 --> 1558.32
externally

1556.96 --> 1561.039
and and that

1558.32 --> 1563.039
is by the way pretty default i mean that

1561.039 --> 1566.559
option is always there that something

1563.039 --> 1568.4
external can just meddle in your affairs

1566.559 --> 1569.6789999999999
and push things to go one way or the

1568.4 --> 1572.24
other

1569.679 --> 1575.8400000000001
i'm just really noticing

1572.24 --> 1575.84
its presence a lot

1576.96 --> 1582.52
a lot more

1578.4 --> 1582.52
than say 10 years ago

1584.96 --> 1589.679
what

1587.039 --> 1592.96
your new cat killed your pet rat

1589.679 --> 1594.48
why what but

1592.96 --> 1596.64
why the hell

1594.48 --> 1599.84
i is that a joke

1596.64 --> 1599.8400000000001
not really funny

1606.799 --> 1614.279
what like why would you

1609.44 --> 1614.279
get a new cat if you have a pet rats

1631.919 --> 1634.64
okay jared

1639.44 --> 1645.3600000000001
i know right pjc that's what i'm talking

1642.159 --> 1648.72
about it makes absolutely no sense

1645.36 --> 1651.6
so it just feels like some like

1648.72 --> 1652.84
something is messing with the potential

1651.6 --> 1656.6399999999999
balance

1652.84 --> 1659.279
right i mean i'm i'm basically just

1656.64 --> 1662.7990000000002
acid yeah the

1659.279 --> 1662.799
ethereal talking almost

1662.88 --> 1667.3600000000001
almost ether like talking but i'm not

1664.96 --> 1669.279
invoking any light paste ether nonsense

1667.36 --> 1671.36
but it's just like the potential that's

1669.279 --> 1672.88
around for things to happen one way or

1671.36 --> 1675.52
the other

1672.88 --> 1678.3990000000001
like with thread breaks

1675.52 --> 1680.24
it's like on the edge and it's like

1678.399 --> 1682.08
goes over the edge

1680.24 --> 1684.559
it doesn't go over the edge and it's

1682.08 --> 1685.4399999999998
like you never really know where it gets

1684.559 --> 1687.6
you could

1685.44 --> 1690.0
think of it as if it is almost in the

1687.6 --> 1692.799
quantum flux state it's like

1690.0 --> 1694.159
you don't really sure and when it's like

1692.799 --> 1695.9189999999999
that

1694.159 --> 1698.64
then suddenly thirdly

1695.919 --> 1699.3600000000001
outside influences and i'm talking about

1698.64 --> 1702.0
like

1699.36 --> 1702.0
outside

1702.32 --> 1708.08
physically incarnated

1704.72 --> 1710.559
something external can just like push it

1708.08 --> 1712.08
one way or the other and it always like

1710.559 --> 1715.279
responds

1712.08 --> 1716.799
to energies and feelings it's freaky

1715.279 --> 1719.679
feels like like

1716.799 --> 1721.679
like little imps are just suddenly

1719.679 --> 1723.8400000000001
sitting on your equipment

1721.679 --> 1726.159
and doing it in direct response to what

1723.84 --> 1726.1589999999999
you do

1729.52 --> 1733.279
it's so weird how that

1731.44 --> 1735.6000000000001
like how that works

1733.279 --> 1735.6
anyway

1737.12 --> 1742.4399999999998
ah you weren't joking oh man

1750.88 --> 1753.8400000000001
um

1754.08 --> 1758.36
how the hell didn't get in the cage

1763.96 --> 1767.079
[Music]

1771.279 --> 1776.08
yeah that's a good call at least she

1773.279 --> 1779.64
like fb laser face really you need to

1776.08 --> 1779.6399999999999
[ __ ] off dude

1793.279 --> 1797.88
hey jeff gassett there he is

1847.679 --> 1850.679
um

1853.36 --> 1860.399
i think we got uh

1856.64 --> 1860.3990000000001
we got troll stalkers today

1861.2 --> 1866.32
don't know why they insist on doing this

1869.6 --> 1874.7199999999998
my grandkids watching me what

1872.48 --> 1874.72
okay

1876.72 --> 1879.72
hello

1902.48 --> 1907.84
bridging generation gap i hope i have no

1905.12 --> 1907.84
idea

1909.12 --> 1914.08
i i really don't know like what kids

1912.799 --> 1917.84
think of me

1914.08 --> 1917.84
the way i present myself because

1918.08 --> 1923.1999999999998
it's

1918.84 --> 1926.32
like i have much i have like when i know

1923.2 --> 1929.6000000000001
that i'm like facing kids i'm just so i

1926.32 --> 1929.6
hold back so much

1932.559 --> 1939.08
that's why i specifically try to aim the

1935.12 --> 1939.08
show for 12 plus

1957.919 --> 1962.3990000000001
what tools to recognize that thing that

1960.159 --> 1964.48
doesn't have a phenomenon

1962.399 --> 1966.799
bill well that's

1964.48 --> 1970.24
i mean your statement there is not even

1966.799 --> 1970.24
that unreasonable but

1971.279 --> 1978.399
look the entire thing is about

1974.84 --> 1978.399
non-manifested things

1978.72 --> 1985.76
if that is like the the foundational

1982.88 --> 1985.7600000000002
description

1986.0 --> 1992.88
then it's pointless to ever assume that

1989.12 --> 1995.76
in the future there might be a way to

1992.88 --> 1998.7990000000002
develop something

1995.76 --> 2002.84
to prove it because it's about the

1998.799 --> 2005.9189999999999
unmanifest like it that would be

2002.84 --> 2009.519
self-contradictory it's or something

2005.919 --> 2009.519
it's just illogical

2011.279 --> 2015.44
you can't prove anything that's not

2013.44 --> 2016.64
manifested

2015.44 --> 2019.8400000000001
that's like

2016.64 --> 2019.8400000000001
kind of fundamental

2027.76 --> 2032.399
rough language sometimes d

2029.919 --> 2034.72
yeah but rough language doesn't mean 80

2032.399 --> 2034.7199999999998
plus

2035.76 --> 2040.48
18 plus effectively means

2039.279 --> 2042.72
like

2040.48 --> 2044.72
sexual talk

2042.72 --> 2046.559
and i don't want that

2044.72 --> 2048.56
i mean i could

2046.559 --> 2050.24
do that

2048.56 --> 2052.24
but i don't want that

2050.24 --> 2053.839
like it's not good for me it doesn't

2052.24 --> 2056.1589999999997
make me happier

2053.839 --> 2059.2
i don't think it's

2056.159 --> 2062.0
a good thing to do especially for what i

2059.2 --> 2063.4399999999996
have in mind doing and that is focusing

2062.0 --> 2066.32
more on

2063.44 --> 2070.679
intellectual spiritual things sexuality

2066.32 --> 2070.679
is only a distraction to that

2074.27 --> 2077.5
[Music]

2078.399 --> 2084.3199999999997
all right and deep topics that is

2080.399 --> 2084.3199999999997
perfectly fine for 12 year olds

2085.2 --> 2087.5989999999997
and

2086.24 --> 2090.4799999999996
like even

2087.599 --> 2092.32
if they'd not be ready for it or in the

2090.48 --> 2095.2
mood for it then they'll

2092.32 --> 2097.679
not be like super shocked

2095.2 --> 2097.6789999999996
anyway

2099.28 --> 2104.4
i mean if you like overwhelm a like a

2102.24 --> 2105.5989999999997
little kid that's like six or eight with

2104.4 --> 2107.88
like

2105.599 --> 2110.0
really heavy stories about like

2107.88 --> 2112.6400000000003
psychopaths and how their mind

2110.0 --> 2115.76
controlling everybody with lies

2112.64 --> 2118.0
and like show examples right yeah

2115.76 --> 2119.8390000000004
like they're not gonna be ready for that

2118.0 --> 2122.64
they're gonna like really

2119.839 --> 2125.04
be shocked probably

2122.64 --> 2127.2
unless they like built up to that and

2125.04 --> 2128.839
they sought it out themselves really

2127.2 --> 2131.52
early so for some

2128.839 --> 2135.599
reason but

2131.52 --> 2137.599
when you're 12 plus on average it's like

2135.599 --> 2139.599
even if you don't want to deal with that

2137.599 --> 2142.079
it's not gonna be that much of a

2139.599 --> 2144.7200000000003
terrible shock it's like when you are

2142.079 --> 2147.44
starting to get ready to be a man

2144.72 --> 2147.4399999999996
or a woman

2148.88 --> 2152.32
or something else

2152.88 --> 2156.1600000000003
no not really you can't really be

2154.56 --> 2160.16
something else but that's

2156.16 --> 2160.16
what some people also do

2163.76 --> 2168.96
so no i don't think that my rough

2166.079 --> 2170.4
language and even my

2168.96 --> 2174.4
rage win

2170.4 --> 2174.4
has anything to do with 18 plus

2182.079 --> 2187.5600000000004
i don't think so

2183.44 --> 2187.56
i think that's 12 plus

2193.68 --> 2198.0
right it's

2195.2 --> 2199.1189999999997
like there is a categorization system

2198.0 --> 2201.04
with this

2199.119 --> 2203.119
even in movies even though it's like

2201.04 --> 2206.24
gone all over the place

2203.119 --> 2210.88
there's but there is specific reasoning

2206.24 --> 2210.8799999999997
behind the original settings of that

2212.8 --> 2217.119
like

2213.599 --> 2220.56
yeah the whole pg thing in pg-13 which

2217.119 --> 2221.92
is kind of like 12 plus

2220.56 --> 2224.0
or

2221.92 --> 2226.88
and then you have 18

2224.0 --> 2228.48
it's like all these factors like sex

2226.88 --> 2229.44
18 plus

2228.48 --> 2231.44
like

2229.44 --> 2234.7200000000003
extreme violence

2231.44 --> 2235.599
like really and gore and [ __ ] is like 16

2234.72 --> 2239.04
plus

2235.599 --> 2241.28
and like very serious subjects

2239.04 --> 2241.2799999999997
like

2241.52 --> 2247.52
struggles and even like fighting

2244.8 --> 2247.52
12 plus

2253.44 --> 2257.839
i don't know it it just makes sense to

2255.68 --> 2257.839
me

2261.68 --> 2265.52
anyway i don't know what i'm talking

2263.28 --> 2265.52
about

2265.92 --> 2271.079
all right yes yeah

2267.52 --> 2271.079
appreciate it

2277.44 --> 2282.0
right but there is another side though

2279.68 --> 2283.68
to having really young people like on

2282.0 --> 2287.92
the floor like

2283.68 --> 2287.9199999999996
presumably jess here says he's 13.

2288.72 --> 2293.52
youngsters can act very youngster-ish

2291.52 --> 2294.88
they're the ones that typically let

2293.52 --> 2297.7599999999998
themselves

2294.88 --> 2300.1600000000003
go too much

2297.76 --> 2303.2000000000003
they're the first to squirt they get too

2300.16 --> 2305.1189999999997
enthusiastic hey and i used to be 12 and

2303.2 --> 2306.3999999999996
13 as well so i know everything about

2305.119 --> 2310.2400000000002
that

2306.4 --> 2310.2400000000002
but it can be a bit disruptive

2310.88 --> 2315.599
i mean even when you're older like tara

2313.359 --> 2316.72
three or six can be very much like a

2315.599 --> 2319.04
youngster

2316.72 --> 2322.0
like it's a good young spirit

2319.04 --> 2322.0
it's good to have that

2324.48 --> 2329.119
and with some really young people they

2327.68 --> 2331.2
have that

2329.119 --> 2333.6800000000003
and then as they grow older it dies out

2331.2 --> 2334.96
and they wisen up or it doesn't really

2333.68 --> 2337.9199999999996
die out

2334.96 --> 2339.119
and then they either learn to deal with

2337.92 --> 2341.599
having it

2339.119 --> 2343.44
successfully or they kind of mock up

2341.599 --> 2346.88
their lives

2343.44 --> 2346.88
and become anti-social

2347.28 --> 2353.4
i'd like to think i've figured out a

2349.68 --> 2353.3999999999996
middle road there

2353.47 --> 2356.68
[Music]

2359.18 --> 2366.5099999999998
[Music]

2367.599 --> 2371.599
yeah no 90 degrees on the ball

2372.079 --> 2379.28
yeah you can do celestial navigation

2375.359 --> 2382.48
on a curved service that's right

2379.28 --> 2384.88
currently registered procedures that you

2382.48 --> 2388.88
have to follow step by step to do

2384.88 --> 2389.6800000000003
celestial navigation in the field

2388.88 --> 2392.0
does

2389.68 --> 2394.24
not include

2392.0 --> 2397.04
like

2394.24 --> 2400.4799999999996
navigating or orientating on a spherical

2397.04 --> 2402.079
surface no it it utilizes even to the

2400.48 --> 2403.52
mathematical

2402.079 --> 2406.1600000000003
perfection

2403.52 --> 2408.52
of flat plane

2406.16 --> 2412.0
and all these

2408.52 --> 2413.92
imaginary add-on procedures that all the

2412.0 --> 2416.16
anti-flat earthers had come up with in

2413.92 --> 2418.0
like the last year

2416.16 --> 2421.68
on how you're actually doing it on the

2418.0 --> 2423.52
ball it's all nonsense it's all dangle

2421.68 --> 2425.839
dingleberry

2423.52 --> 2425.839
math

2426.319 --> 2430.64
all the original

2429.04 --> 2433.359
navigation

2430.64 --> 2435.7599999999998
procedures all work off black planes all

2433.359 --> 2437.2799999999997
of it in all languages

2435.76 --> 2438.96
in all countries

2437.28 --> 2441.52
in all ages

2438.96 --> 2443.359
because the earth is flat and that's the

2441.52 --> 2444.88
you have to

2443.359 --> 2448.48
use

2444.88 --> 2451.599
the geometry of the flat earth

2448.48 --> 2455.359
to navigate or those procedures that we

2451.599 --> 2455.3590000000004
all use would not work

2465.52 --> 2468.56
what's going on here

2475.28 --> 2480.5600000000004
oh hey cavapo

2477.44 --> 2482.88
inventor of the periodic table

2480.56 --> 2484.56
believed in ether

2482.88 --> 2486.88
cool

2484.56 --> 2488.7999999999997
well they can all believe in it if they

2486.88 --> 2494.52
like

2488.8 --> 2494.52
i mean i believe in electrical ether

2494.72 --> 2499.5989999999997
i believe there is like

2497.119 --> 2500.88
untapped electricity in the air that's

2499.599 --> 2503.04
basically

2500.88 --> 2505.2000000000003
the description that's all

2503.04 --> 2506.48
like i don't even need to go further

2505.2 --> 2509.04
than that it's just like yeah there's

2506.48 --> 2511.44
electricity in there it makes sense for

2509.04 --> 2513.68
manifestation of the non-local

2511.44 --> 2515.2000000000003
holographic celestials

2513.68 --> 2519.44
i mean the energy would have to come

2515.2 --> 2519.4399999999996
from somewhere in the physical realm

2519.68 --> 2524.48
to fulfill the cycle but

2523.52 --> 2528.079
like

2524.48 --> 2529.599
all the other like ken wheeler spiraling

2528.079 --> 2532.1600000000003
add-ons

2529.599 --> 2535.1600000000003
it's all nonsense like you don't need

2532.16 --> 2535.16
that

2536.24 --> 2541.68
he's just tying it all into one big soup

2539.04 --> 2544.319
it's like making ether soup i mean how

2541.68 --> 2546.7999999999997
many different ethers are there did you

2544.319 --> 2548.88
know that there is like four or five

2546.8 --> 2551.04
different ethers i summed it up like

2548.88 --> 2552.6400000000003
what is it now two months ago on a show

2551.04 --> 2553.68
one time

2552.64 --> 2556.48
i mean there's all these different

2553.68 --> 2558.3999999999996
ethers and it seems like ken wheeler

2556.48 --> 2560.0
through his

2558.4 --> 2564.1600000000003
system his

2560.0 --> 2568.16
continual spider he's wheeling around

2564.16 --> 2572.0789999999997
it all just blends into one

2568.16 --> 2572.0789999999997
roughly correlating soup

2572.4 --> 2578.56
that's what he's doing so he i think he

2574.48 --> 2582.72
is effectively reifying

2578.56 --> 2584.7599999999998
the electric ether which i think exists

2582.72 --> 2588.0789999999997
with the light ether which is a

2584.76 --> 2589.2000000000003
presuppositional misconception

2588.079 --> 2592.2400000000002
and

2589.2 --> 2595.839
who knows what else

2592.24 --> 2599.04
right but for example his idea

2595.839 --> 2602.0789999999997
his concept which is seems to be mostly

2599.04 --> 2603.359
correlating to the electric ether about

2602.079 --> 2605.92
like how

2603.359 --> 2607.7599999999998
magnetism and electricity are like two

2605.92 --> 2609.76
sides of the same coin and there's

2607.76 --> 2613.44
always either i think that that is a

2609.76 --> 2613.44
very valuable insight

2613.68 --> 2619.44
so i thought that the first time i ever

2615.76 --> 2622.3190000000004
saw that right that but it's just that

2619.44 --> 2623.92
just that only that just that one thing

2622.319 --> 2626.319
i just mentioned

2623.92 --> 2628.88
that's it that's like valuable that's

2626.319 --> 2631.68
like wow it's so simple oh

2628.88 --> 2633.6800000000003
but then always everybody that deals in

2631.68 --> 2635.96
ken wheeler soup

2633.68 --> 2638.72
always oh and this and that in a

2635.96 --> 2640.319
perpetuation and

2638.72 --> 2642.0789999999997
it just never stops

2640.319 --> 2644.72
when it's just

2642.079 --> 2647.8390000000004
a really simple thing really and then

2644.72 --> 2649.7599999999998
just this endless conjecture wheeling

2647.839 --> 2652.319
around

2649.76 --> 2653.8390000000004
it's pointless

2652.319 --> 2657.0
hello by the way nathan oakley good to

2653.839 --> 2657.0
see you

2666.56 --> 2669.359
take it easy

2674.8 --> 2678.96
all right yeah now this is professor

2677.28 --> 2681.2000000000003
phil wells just going a bit on the

2678.96 --> 2682.88
recycling tour with what he's saying now

2681.2 --> 2685.2
so the airlines

2682.88 --> 2688.6400000000003
and shipping companies are navigating on

2685.2 --> 2693.4399999999996
a flat pla flat earth with what map

2688.64 --> 2695.1189999999997
well yes with the map that you stay

2693.44 --> 2697.76
and this might even be echoed by

2695.119 --> 2700.56
wikipedia and all that the same

2697.76 --> 2704.4
groups that say that coriolis effect is

2700.56 --> 2705.7599999999998
an actual deviation yeah that the same

2704.4 --> 2708.319
sources

2705.76 --> 2710.3190000000004
yeah will also say oh this the end look

2708.319 --> 2714.079
at this map yeah this map

2710.319 --> 2717.7599999999998
is based off of ball earth

2714.079 --> 2718.88
and that is factually incorrect

2717.76 --> 2721.3590000000004
a

2718.88 --> 2724.2400000000002
it's a displacement it's actually based

2721.359 --> 2726.0
on a celestial sphere

2724.24 --> 2727.68
right centered around the celestial

2726.0 --> 2731.359
sphere

2727.68 --> 2734.0789999999997
under which a projection was made

2731.359 --> 2736.88
of the earth using the flat maps

2734.079 --> 2740.319
underneath folded into a ball

2736.88 --> 2743.04
and that was then unfolded into

2740.319 --> 2744.319
i think it was the mercator project of

2743.04 --> 2746.24
the

2744.319 --> 2749.2799999999997
indicator projection or one of the

2746.24 --> 2751.2799999999997
others but ballers and anti-flat

2749.28 --> 2753.28
earthers but mostly ballers keep saying

2751.28 --> 2755.0400000000004
oh that's based on a

2753.28 --> 2757.8390000000004
on a ball this map is based on the ball

2755.04 --> 2759.599
well it's just not true

2757.839 --> 2762.319
if you actually figure out how

2759.599 --> 2765.2000000000003
cartography works

2762.319 --> 2767.52
how it's all based on the celestial

2765.2 --> 2769.5989999999997
orientations

2767.52 --> 2774.24
versus the terrain

2769.599 --> 2777.839
and then put into a combined projection

2774.24 --> 2778.72
it's not based off a globe

2777.839 --> 2782.4
that's

2778.72 --> 2784.319
like a little trick they did in between

2782.4 --> 2787.359
it

2784.319 --> 2789.04
right it so you could say yeah

2787.359 --> 2792.24
it's based

2789.04 --> 2794.319
it's a flat map based off a globe

2792.24 --> 2796.8799999999997
projection

2794.319 --> 2799.119
based off of flat map

2796.88 --> 2802.4
that's actually what it is

2799.119 --> 2803.92
when when people like phil b say that

2802.4 --> 2804.8
and i know this

2803.92 --> 2808.0
i mean

2804.8 --> 2810.4
this is a little trixie that they do

2808.0 --> 2811.92
that's been doing that for a long time i

2810.4 --> 2813.76
recognize it

2811.92 --> 2817.6800000000003
i learned a lot

2813.76 --> 2819.76
now i know oh when they say oh

2817.68 --> 2822.64
oh look at the navigators they're using

2819.76 --> 2825.44
this map oh when i google it

2822.64 --> 2827.5989999999997
wikipedia says that that globe

2825.44 --> 2830.4
is based or that

2827.599 --> 2832.0
that flat map is based off a globe

2830.4 --> 2832.7200000000003
projection

2832.0 --> 2833.92
pro

2832.72 --> 2835.68
pro

2833.92 --> 2836.88
projection

2835.68 --> 2839.5989999999997
yeah

2836.88 --> 2840.96
not of a globe terrain no a pro

2839.599 --> 2843.44
projection

2840.96 --> 2844.88
it's based off a projection yeah that's

2843.44 --> 2848.079
right

2844.88 --> 2850.2400000000002
a projection a map projection

2848.079 --> 2852.88
but what it's kind of left out is that

2850.24 --> 2854.64
yeah in order to do that

2852.88 --> 2857.04
you're gonna have to start measuring

2854.64 --> 2859.2
things in the world and

2857.04 --> 2863.68
yeah the data

2859.2 --> 2865.68
used in order to establish the globe pro

2863.68 --> 2868.16
projection

2865.68 --> 2869.839
was actually a flat

2868.16 --> 2870.839
plain

2869.839 --> 2875.2
based

2870.839 --> 2876.96
projection yeah the globe projection

2875.2 --> 2881.5989999999997
is constructed

2876.96 --> 2881.599
based on a flat projection

2881.76 --> 2886.119
they leave that little part out

2887.52 --> 2891.28
would you like to address that professor

2889.839 --> 2893.839
feel well

2891.28 --> 2897.559
you don't have to i'm i'm making the

2893.839 --> 2897.5589999999997
statement regardless

2900.41 --> 2903.56
[Music]

2905.89 --> 2912.52
[Music]

2909.52 --> 2912.52
now

2914.16 --> 2919.1189999999997
the flat earth mercator was constructed

2916.8 --> 2919.119
from

2919.359 --> 2922.7999999999997
wait

2920.319 --> 2925.119
it's no point make yeah

2922.8 --> 2927.3590000000004
from there it doesn't matter it's one

2925.119 --> 2929.04
projection made based on another

2927.359 --> 2930.319
projection

2929.04 --> 2932.5589999999997
i'm just saying

2930.319 --> 2934.4
it has to be based off of black

2932.559 --> 2936.2400000000002
projection

2934.4 --> 2939.44
because that is

2936.24 --> 2941.5989999999997
how you collect the data to do it that's

2939.44 --> 2943.52
how you collect the celestial angular

2941.599 --> 2946.079
data

2943.52 --> 2949.7599999999998
and cross-reference it with the terrain

2946.079 --> 2951.44
you use the horizon you use 90 degrees

2949.76 --> 2954.6400000000003
that's how you make it

2951.44 --> 2958.96
so i don't know if they literally have

2954.64 --> 2961.2799999999997
an official original map that they used

2958.96 --> 2962.8
as a source to try to construct the

2961.28 --> 2966.079
globe projection

2962.8 --> 2968.48
but they would have had to

2966.079 --> 2971.3590000000004
it's no choice they couldn't have just

2968.48 --> 2973.839
created a glow projection from

2971.359 --> 2976.88
just data and nothing

2973.839 --> 2978.88
because they can't just gather it

2976.88 --> 2980.8
from nothing they have to gather the

2978.88 --> 2983.359
actual map data

2980.8 --> 2985.52
they have to gather the topography

2983.359 --> 2987.44
that data and the angular data of the

2985.52 --> 2989.28
celestials they have to gather that well

2987.44 --> 2991.92
how do you do that well you do it on a

2989.28 --> 2993.3590000000004
flat plane using 90 degrees with the

2991.92 --> 2995.6800000000003
horizon

2993.359 --> 2999.48
that's how you do it it's the only way

2995.68 --> 2999.48
to gather that data

3002.16 --> 3007.7599999999998
that's right nathan

3004.48 --> 3007.76
i've been paying attention

3010.559 --> 3014.48
i'm up to date with the flat earth

3012.079 --> 3014.48
debate

3019.04 --> 3024.72
so who has the original flat projection

3021.92 --> 3026.96
well if it's i think it's if it is

3024.72 --> 3029.52
anywhere it's going to be in the vatican

3026.96 --> 3029.52
library

3029.599 --> 3033.92
maybe secret maybe not even a secret

3032.8 --> 3037.28
just

3033.92 --> 3040.48
i mean they were the guys you do realize

3037.28 --> 3043.52
that professor phil well i mean

3040.48 --> 3045.599
the the jesuits were the astronomers

3043.52 --> 3048.079
were the cartographers they were the

3045.599 --> 3048.079
guys

3048.72 --> 3053.359
they effectively monopolized that in a

3051.04 --> 3055.599
way industrialized it they sent their

3053.359 --> 3060.0
jesuits around the world for these

3055.599 --> 3061.599
purposes gathering data map data

3060.0 --> 3063.839
bringing maps

3061.599 --> 3066.96
bringing ink bringing

3063.839 --> 3071.2799999999997
telescopes with them

3066.96 --> 3071.28
everywhere everywhere in the world

3072.079 --> 3076.8
so if there is this original map

3075.04 --> 3079.04
that they was constructed with all the

3076.8 --> 3081.44
data they gathered

3079.04 --> 3084.319
it's going to be in the vatican because

3081.44 --> 3086.7200000000003
those were the guys that were doing that

3084.319 --> 3088.72
they were practically the source of a

3086.72 --> 3090.7999999999997
lot of cartography

3088.72 --> 3093.68
so

3090.8 --> 3093.6800000000003
primary source

3094.0 --> 3098.4
that they were the ones effectively to

3096.0 --> 3102.24
industrialize it where before it was

3098.4 --> 3102.2400000000002
just a couple of people

3102.72 --> 3106.8799999999997
and they all had their own weird issues

3104.72 --> 3108.7999999999997
and lack of knowledge right we know the

3106.88 --> 3111.359
all these super old maps well you can

3108.8 --> 3114.76
immediately spot the issues is that the

3111.359 --> 3114.7599999999998
lack of knowledge

3130.4 --> 3135.6800000000003
really professor you're gonna just do

3132.4 --> 3137.44
the same routine again to nathan

3135.68 --> 3139.2
god

3137.44 --> 3141.359
hey you seeking star wars good to see

3139.2 --> 3141.359
you

3151.2 --> 3156.96
i don't know about that seek like

3153.28 --> 3159.119
venetians were phoenicians

3156.96 --> 3162.559
like cartographers

3159.119 --> 3162.559
i'm not sure about that

3163.92 --> 3169.599
i mean venetians the phoenicians could

3167.2 --> 3171.68
be i mean

3169.599 --> 3173.76
they were into a lot of different things

3171.68 --> 3176.0
but they were definitely into the power

3173.76 --> 3178.8
of knowledge with anything they could

3176.0 --> 3181.599
get their hands on

3178.8 --> 3183.92
but venetians i don't know about that

3181.599 --> 3187.839
i think phoenicians were just more into

3183.92 --> 3187.839
like squirting and banking and

3188.4 --> 3192.88
being all

3189.52 --> 3192.88
luciferian and [ __ ]

3192.96 --> 3198.4
then again

3194.48 --> 3201.28
i don't know everything about venetia

3198.4 --> 3201.28
old phoenicia

3206.319 --> 3212.8
what am i sipping on just green tea rick

3209.28 --> 3212.8
back just green tea

3219.599 --> 3224.0
ah

3220.96 --> 3224.0
what's that cleary

3225.92 --> 3230.2400000000002
uh

3227.839 --> 3230.24
wow

3230.4 --> 3233.52
that's their logo

3233.839 --> 3236.839
that's

3238.0 --> 3240.559
i don't know

3241.359 --> 3247.359
demonic certainly incredibly fantastic

3244.64 --> 3250.48
what dragon really

3247.359 --> 3252.88
a green dragon on a ball earth [ __ ]

3250.48 --> 3252.88
sake

3254.4 --> 3257.04
that's just

3258.48 --> 3264.559
that's just too much

3260.079 --> 3267.28
okay that is a very interesting link

3264.559 --> 3267.28
thank you for that

3277.28 --> 3281.76
hey robert is that really you

3285.2 --> 3289.0789999999997
yeah i think it is

3300.4 --> 3303.4
uh

3317.52 --> 3320.52
uh

3320.799 --> 3324.48
yeah

3322.16 --> 3326.72
i don't yeah phil bill i don't think

3324.48 --> 3326.72
that

3327.599 --> 3332.839
nathan is very interested

3330.319 --> 3335.839
in having it back and forth with you

3332.839 --> 3338.16
constantly about that stupid question

3335.839 --> 3340.0
that i already elaborately answered to

3338.16 --> 3341.839
you

3340.0 --> 3344.96
you seem to have forgotten all the

3341.839 --> 3345.839
details about it and just proceeded to

3344.96 --> 3347.92
ask

3345.839 --> 3349.92
the same question to another person

3347.92 --> 3352.48
nathan in this case i i don't know why

3349.92 --> 3354.7200000000003
you do that though because

3352.48 --> 3356.16
didn't somebody already elaborately give

3354.72 --> 3358.3999999999996
you an answer

3356.16 --> 3359.839
the show host

3358.4 --> 3362.559
me

3359.839 --> 3364.96
that's gonna be audible

3362.559 --> 3367.52
while you are in the chat

3364.96 --> 3369.52
asking that question that the the actual

3367.52 --> 3371.52
show host just answered and now you're

3369.52 --> 3373.04
gonna ask that question again to another

3371.52 --> 3374.72
person

3373.04 --> 3375.68
why would you do that

3374.72 --> 3377.839
philby

3375.68 --> 3377.839
why

3389.37 --> 3392.54
[Music]

3399.2 --> 3405.72
right yeah rob i didn't recognize the

3401.52 --> 3405.72
picture but that is you i guess

3406.88 --> 3411.2400000000002
oh god

3408.24 --> 3411.24
really

3419.62 --> 3422.7999999999997
[Music]

3431.359 --> 3435.5989999999997
but this i don't know if it's that

3433.2 --> 3435.5989999999997
seeking

3436.0 --> 3438.48
i mean

3440.24 --> 3446.2799999999997
it could turn into that

3443.28 --> 3446.28
maybe

3446.48 --> 3451.839
it's certainly playing into dementia but

3449.359 --> 3451.839
i just

3452.72 --> 3456.5589999999997
i'm just trying to figure out why he's

3454.48 --> 3460.0
doing it

3456.559 --> 3462.079
like if he's asking a question

3460.0 --> 3465.2
and somebody literally gives you a very

3462.079 --> 3465.2000000000003
detailed answer

3465.839 --> 3471.839
then why would you immediately just ask

3468.24 --> 3475.04
the same question again to somebody else

3471.839 --> 3479.0789999999997
unless you were not actually ready to

3475.04 --> 3479.079
have the question answered

3489.119 --> 3493.799
okay take it easy guys

3502.079 --> 3504.319
what

3506.16 --> 3510.72
okay george sanford i don't know

3508.72 --> 3513.72
there's all kinds of weird scams going

3510.72 --> 3513.72
on

3517.68 --> 3522.0
yeah

3518.88 --> 3526.1600000000003
like for example there's actual

3522.0 --> 3526.16
i can't believe that that's still out

3528.839 --> 3533.52
there there's like

3530.96 --> 3536.4
collecting things in

3533.52 --> 3539.839
big supermarkets

3536.4 --> 3539.839
i saw recently like oh

3539.92 --> 3546.16
like cancer research

3543.359 --> 3548.48
oh we need money for cancer research and

3546.16 --> 3549.92
they literally like showed a picture of

3548.48 --> 3552.799
like

3549.92 --> 3554.64
like a 3d

3552.799 --> 3557.359
visual not an actual photograph of

3554.64 --> 3559.92
anybody like with like ooh

3557.359 --> 3563.68
red like in their face and i'm like oh

3559.92 --> 3568.319
really really you need research

3563.68 --> 3572.5589999999997
as to why that's happening do you

3568.319 --> 3574.48
oh yes we need money to find out why

3572.559 --> 3577.44
that's happening

3574.48 --> 3580.2400000000002
oh it's not like blatantly obvious

3577.44 --> 3581.68
what's causing those things

3580.24 --> 3584.72
like

3581.68 --> 3587.68
number one cause of like brain cancer

3584.72 --> 3590.319
and [ __ ] is freaking mobile phones

3587.68 --> 3591.1189999999997
putting him in your face

3590.319 --> 3593.839
yeah

3591.119 --> 3597.2000000000003
that's that was kind of figured out even

3593.839 --> 3599.68
in the late 90s

3597.2 --> 3602.72
i mean come on

3599.68 --> 3604.48
and uh yeah i mean

3602.72 --> 3607.2
why would you need to

3604.48 --> 3609.04
you don't need any more of that

3607.2 --> 3611.839
i'm serious i mean

3609.04 --> 3614.0
it's kind of apparent as to why that's

3611.839 --> 3615.359
happening why those white people are

3614.0 --> 3618.4
getting cancer

3615.359 --> 3620.96
oh oh surprise surprise

3618.4 --> 3624.64
it's not the things that are mainly

3620.96 --> 3626.64
advertised as supposedly the cause

3624.64 --> 3628.319
no those things are actually kind of

3626.64 --> 3630.5589999999997
like shoved than the carpet that are

3628.319 --> 3632.4
actually the cause because

3630.559 --> 3635.8390000000004
well they just

3632.4 --> 3635.839
don't really care

3640.24 --> 3644.64
so those i think are absolute frauds as

3642.799 --> 3647.52
well

3644.64 --> 3647.52
like any of those

3647.68 --> 3652.0
supposed foundations oh we're doing

3650.799 --> 3653.7599999999998
oh we're doing

3652.0 --> 3657.28
research

3653.76 --> 3660.1600000000003
on this like oh really

3657.28 --> 3662.799
research are you

3660.16 --> 3665.68
or you're just kind of like

3662.799 --> 3667.92
sipping seeping off the desperation and

3665.68 --> 3669.5989999999997
ignorance of people that literally don't

3667.92 --> 3671.839
know what the [ __ ] is going on in the

3669.599 --> 3675.04
world

3671.839 --> 3677.52
by asking money to research something

3675.04 --> 3679.839
that is like kind of blatantly obvious

3677.52 --> 3681.28
as to what's causing all that

3679.839 --> 3685.839
yes

3681.28 --> 3685.8390000000004
it's not a scam at all

3686.16 --> 3691.2
raising money for court fees

3689.04 --> 3694.64
ugh

3691.2 --> 3694.64
talking about alex jones now

3697.04 --> 3701.7599999999998
darpa whistleblower who are you talking

3698.799 --> 3701.7599999999998
about territ what

3706.319 --> 3710.5589999999997
you're glad you gave up smoking okay

3708.4 --> 3714.1600000000003
well good for you i don't think that

3710.559 --> 3718.3190000000004
smoking is the cause of cancer

3714.16 --> 3718.319
like not the actual tobacco

3719.52 --> 3721.839
huh

3722.72 --> 3727.359
i mean some of the oldest men in the

3726.079 --> 3729.119
world

3727.359 --> 3730.5589999999997
are smokers

3729.119 --> 3733.839
ah ah

3730.559 --> 3735.8390000000004
yeah because you don't just get cancer

3733.839 --> 3739.2
from smoking

3735.839 --> 3741.839
you get it from the crap they put in

3739.2 --> 3741.839
there

3742.4 --> 3750.319
and from stress habits also

3746.24 --> 3754.0
partying oh yeah oh you smoke yeah oh

3750.319 --> 3757.119
oh wait it's not just smoking is it it's

3754.0 --> 3759.76
also drinking really shitty alcohol with

3757.119 --> 3762.7200000000003
like terrible sugar in it and

3759.76 --> 3764.96
eating crap food on top of that with all

3762.72 --> 3765.9199999999996
kinds of chemicals in there

3764.96 --> 3769.52
and

3765.92 --> 3771.28
just having terrible social behavior

3769.52 --> 3772.72
and nobody correcting it so you're not

3771.28 --> 3776.1600000000003
even noticing it

3772.72 --> 3779.839
all that compounding together yeah

3776.16 --> 3782.48
yeah that can definitely then be all

3779.839 --> 3784.5589999999997
shoved into the into the shoes of

3782.48 --> 3786.16
smoking it's oh it's the smoking that

3784.559 --> 3790.3190000000004
did oh yes

3786.16 --> 3793.799
yes or it's all of it together

3790.319 --> 3793.799
how about that

3798.88 --> 3801.2000000000003
dude

3806.64 --> 3811.0389999999998
yeah george hose

3808.96 --> 3813.599
what the [ __ ] are you even basing that

3811.039 --> 3813.599
[ __ ] on

3815.92 --> 3822.799
live seven years less than what

3819.039 --> 3824.88
then people that get killed because they

3822.799 --> 3828.319
become subject

3824.88 --> 3832.2400000000002
to medical experimentation and

3828.319 --> 3835.2799999999997
basically covert occult euthanasia

3832.24 --> 3839.4799999999996
no i don't think that smokers live seven

3835.28 --> 3839.48
years less on average

3853.68 --> 3856.64
yeah [ __ ] off

3860.559 --> 3866.0
yeah my mother also dart so you can go

3863.359 --> 3867.839
[ __ ] yourself i can say whatever the

3866.0 --> 3868.72
[ __ ] i want

3867.839 --> 3872.0789999999997
yeah

3868.72 --> 3872.0789999999997
i can talk about that

3877.2 --> 3882.24
and i didn't say that all cancer is

3879.839 --> 3884.319
caused by mobile technology

3882.24 --> 3887.7599999999998
i use that as an example because that

3884.319 --> 3890.64
was literally the visual

3887.76 --> 3892.559
that they put

3890.64 --> 3895.2
at the

3892.559 --> 3897.76
at the collection spot

3895.2 --> 3899.68
it's like oh cancer research and

3897.76 --> 3902.96
literally ahead

3899.68 --> 3905.44
with like oh it's it's there oh really

3902.96 --> 3909.039
why would it be there

3905.44 --> 3911.76
oh such a mystery i mean it's not like

3909.039 --> 3914.119
literally all modern phones of like the

3911.76 --> 3916.96
last 10 years all have

3914.119 --> 3920.48
explicit warnings in the instruction

3916.96 --> 3924.559
manual to keep the phone an arm's length

3920.48 --> 3927.68
away from your head at all times i mean

3924.559 --> 3930.7200000000003
why why are you getting that oh you have

3927.68 --> 3933.2799999999997
to pay this money to research why that's

3930.72 --> 3937.7599999999998
happening oh yes

3933.28 --> 3940.96
yeah yeah it doesn't have anything to do

3937.76 --> 3943.96
with whatever your dad died off

3940.96 --> 3943.96
okay

3954.24 --> 3957.68
right and yeah you can

3957.76 --> 3963.5200000000004
also get cancer in many other ways

3961.44 --> 3964.96
it's not that hard to get it all you

3963.52 --> 3967.44
have to do is just

3964.96 --> 3970.16
abuse yourself and ignore the damage and

3967.44 --> 3974.68
keep going

3970.16 --> 3974.68
eventually you will get it yeah

3984.16 --> 3988.24
wow okay that is insane professor phil

3987.119 --> 3990.88
bell

3988.24 --> 3994.319
i don't know why you would like buy a

3990.88 --> 3996.19
cigarette anyway just like

3994.319 --> 3997.839
uh grow your own

3996.19 --> 3999.52
[Music]

3997.839 --> 4000.5589999999997
fresh

3999.52 --> 4003.599
fresh

4000.559 --> 4005.76
organic tobacco leaves

4003.599 --> 4008.1600000000003
i mean

4005.76 --> 4009.039
why the hell would you pay

4008.16 --> 4011.5989999999997
over

4009.039 --> 4013.44
what did you say over a dollar for a

4011.599 --> 4016.0
single cigarette

4013.44 --> 4019.44
when you can just like

4016.0 --> 4021.599
practically grow your own for free

4019.44 --> 4024.64
and you're in australia dude it's not

4021.599 --> 4028.96
like oh yeah it's always raining uh it's

4024.64 --> 4028.96
australia that's like optimal

4033.119 --> 4036.7200000000003
dude [ __ ] off

4035.52 --> 4039.119
yeah

4036.72 --> 4043.0389999999998
you don't get to scream

4039.119 --> 4043.039
like a pig in my chat

4043.359 --> 4048.16
get banned and then reappear

4046.559 --> 4050.3190000000004
with another sock account and just

4048.16 --> 4054.24
continue the conversation like you

4050.319 --> 4057.799
didn't scream like a maniac pig in my

4054.24 --> 4057.799
chat dart

4073.2 --> 4076.2
wow

4078.799 --> 4081.68
yeah that's not

4080.4 --> 4083.359
cheap either

4081.68 --> 4086.359
robert

4083.359 --> 4086.359
and

4090.4 --> 4094.079
it's illegal

4092.24 --> 4096.3189999999995
are you sure about that

4094.079 --> 4098.319
are you sure it's not just illegal to

4096.319 --> 4100.319
sell it

4098.319 --> 4102.56
are you sure about that professor phil

4100.319 --> 4102.56
bill

4102.88 --> 4107.6
like how can a plant just growing a

4105.52 --> 4110.719
plant be illegal

4107.6 --> 4115.120000000001
i mean if it would selling it i'd say

4110.719 --> 4117.679
yeah yeah you could definitely make

4115.12 --> 4118.5599999999995
commerce based laws to say to prohibit

4117.679 --> 4121.1990000000005
that

4118.56 --> 4125.04
right or with licensing another but just

4121.199 --> 4128.719
growing your own that's ridiculous

4125.04 --> 4128.719
why the hell would that be illegal

4128.96 --> 4133.839
that's

4129.92 --> 4133.839
really [ __ ] up

4162.4 --> 4165.3589999999995
wow

4163.359 --> 4167.52
well that is just [ __ ] up professor

4165.359 --> 4172.0
filbell that is [ __ ] up

4167.52 --> 4175.120000000001
your government is absolutely [ __ ] up

4172.0 --> 4178.239
is parasitic then because what the hell

4175.12 --> 4180.159
australia is like ideal

4178.239 --> 4182.3189999999995
for growing a whole whole range of

4180.159 --> 4186.3589999999995
plants why the [ __ ] would they just make

4182.319 --> 4186.359
that illegal like that

4192.52 --> 4195.6990000000005
[Music]

4204.159 --> 4207.12
and like who the hell would check that

4206.0 --> 4208.96
anyway

4207.12 --> 4211.84
i mean yeah if you're going to like make

4208.96 --> 4213.92
a plantation yeah i get it right that's

4211.84 --> 4216.0
for sales

4213.92 --> 4218.4800000000005
you're going to get a license but jake

4216.0 --> 4220.8
you have a garden whenever a bunch of

4218.48 --> 4222.4
lattice and radishes or whatever you're

4220.8 --> 4224.4800000000005
gonna grow

4222.4 --> 4226.4
like okay if you have like a cannabis

4224.48 --> 4228.159
plant it's yeah of course it's illegal

4226.4 --> 4230.639999999999
there i would get it like the police

4228.159 --> 4232.5599999999995
would spot that be like dude big

4230.64 --> 4234.8
freaking fine maybe jail time i don't

4232.56 --> 4237.76
know how it works but just like a

4234.8 --> 4240.400000000001
tobacco plant like would that even be

4237.76 --> 4242.8
generally recognized it just looks like

4240.4 --> 4243.759999999999
some typical weed or something

4242.8 --> 4245.360000000001
i mean

4243.76 --> 4248.2390000000005
what the [ __ ]

4245.36 --> 4250.48
can't be serious

4248.239 --> 4254.239
because they want the tax

4250.48 --> 4254.239
yeah but that makes no sense

4254.8 --> 4260.719
they want the tax

4257.12 --> 4263.44
it has to be for selling

4260.719 --> 4266.96
not growing

4263.44 --> 4268.799999999999
you that makes no it makes no

4266.96 --> 4271.04
legal sense

4268.8 --> 4274.4800000000005
to have a tax on literally growing a

4271.04 --> 4276.88
plant if you want the tax

4274.48 --> 4279.919999999999
selling the plant or product from the

4276.88 --> 4281.12
plan yeah i get that that's a commercial

4279.92 --> 4283.92
tax

4281.12 --> 4286.64
that's kind of like normal

4283.92 --> 4290.2390000000005
but to literally just grow the plant

4286.64 --> 4293.12
attacks that is just idiotic

4290.239 --> 4298.08
that's slavery

4293.12 --> 4298.08
that that is like a form of slavery

4298.32 --> 4302.719
that's not just commercial

4300.88 --> 4306.28
taxes

4302.719 --> 4306.28
it's really bizarre

4308.91 --> 4312.2789999999995
[Music]

4325.679 --> 4331.4400000000005
right but dude i want to grow my own

4328.239 --> 4333.36
tobacco plants if i could i would that's

4331.44 --> 4335.599999999999
the better together with cannabis

4333.36 --> 4336.96
because that is actually legal you can

4335.6 --> 4338.4800000000005
have a couple of plants here in the

4336.96 --> 4340.4800000000005
netherlands if you just keep it for

4338.48 --> 4341.44
yourself

4340.48 --> 4344.08
right

4341.44 --> 4346.879999999999
don't bother anybody with it

4344.08 --> 4350.719
because it can smell potentially

4346.88 --> 4352.88
that's that's actually legalized here

4350.719 --> 4352.88
but

4353.6 --> 4357.84
yeah

4355.76 --> 4359.84
like why not

4357.84 --> 4361.84
tobacco

4359.84 --> 4364.64
if i could get the conditions right in

4361.84 --> 4365.76
temperatures i would absolutely try it

4364.64 --> 4370.360000000001
at least

4365.76 --> 4370.360000000001
to grow it one time here

4373.679 --> 4378.719
yeah the disturbing pictures i know yes

4376.56 --> 4380.64
and that is actually more detrimental

4378.719 --> 4382.64
than the smoking

4380.64 --> 4383.6
because it's just

4382.64 --> 4386.719
like

4383.6 --> 4389.360000000001
conditioning they're just pavlovia

4386.719 --> 4391.76
pavlovian conditioning you

4389.36 --> 4393.839999999999
it does disgusting pictures to just

4391.76 --> 4397.12
imagine how you're gonna meet this

4393.84 --> 4399.6
terrible end and literally just

4397.12 --> 4402.159
indoctrinating you continue this so

4399.6 --> 4403.1990000000005
you're doomed look at the horror

4402.159 --> 4406.4
it's

4403.199 --> 4408.159
inhumane i think it is thoroughly

4406.4 --> 4411.36
inhumane

4408.159 --> 4414.239
and that actually causes psychological

4411.36 --> 4415.12
and medical damage

4414.239 --> 4417.678999999999
right

4415.12 --> 4420.0
because of the psychosomatics constantly

4417.679 --> 4423.1990000000005
imprinting you with that well if you

4420.0 --> 4426.719
don't even realize that it's not real

4423.199 --> 4429.28
you might just get indoctrinated and

4426.719 --> 4432.32
then manifest it

4429.28 --> 4434.4
and they know this it's a psychological

4432.32 --> 4436.799999999999
if you constantly tell somebody they're

4434.4 --> 4438.719
ill in a very specific way there's a

4436.8 --> 4441.04
chance that they're going to grow to

4438.719 --> 4442.32
believe it at some point and that's what

4441.04 --> 4444.159
that is

4442.32 --> 4446.799999999999
it's psychomedical

4444.159 --> 4446.799999999999
assault

4447.6 --> 4453.52
and i think it should be forbidden in my

4450.96 --> 4456.56
in my opinion that should be absolutely

4453.52 --> 4459.040000000001
made illegal to do that to be forced

4456.56 --> 4462.4800000000005
onto products like that

4459.04 --> 4462.48
should be made illegal

4465.199 --> 4469.839999999999
it's not a good cause

4467.6 --> 4470.96
and getting rid of tobacco is not a good

4469.84 --> 4474.56
thing

4470.96 --> 4474.56
tobacco is not bad

4476.56 --> 4481.4400000000005
it's all been hijacked i think that

4479.52 --> 4483.6
tobacco is probably one of the most

4481.44 --> 4485.839999999999
medicinal plants that

4483.6 --> 4488.96
humanity ever came across

4485.84 --> 4491.12
that's why an entire industry like took

4488.96 --> 4493.84
control of it like rubber barons and

4491.12 --> 4496.64
have been trying to destroy their own

4493.84 --> 4499.4400000000005
industry ever since

4496.64 --> 4502.08
are just poisoning it they're just

4499.44 --> 4504.48
using a great product and then just

4502.08 --> 4506.96
putting poison it then oh look people

4504.48 --> 4509.36
are getting cancer and dying oh we're

4506.96 --> 4511.04
gonna spend a giant lobby to try to hide

4509.36 --> 4513.679
that

4511.04 --> 4516.88
wow everybody gets conditioned and

4513.679 --> 4519.679
reified through the liberal side about

4516.88 --> 4522.8
how tobacco's causing no it was always

4519.679 --> 4525.92
the [ __ ] poisonous [ __ ] they put in

4522.8 --> 4528.96
there it was never the tobacco it was

4525.92 --> 4532.08
always the poison the [ __ ]

4528.96 --> 4535.36
industrialist shoved in there

4532.08 --> 4537.36
yeah you don't get any of that stuff

4535.36 --> 4539.92
from clean

4537.36 --> 4543.759999999999
organically grown

4539.92 --> 4545.04
grown tobacco plants you don't get any

4543.76 --> 4548.4800000000005
of it

4545.04 --> 4551.6
you get it from the specific industrial

4548.48 --> 4554.799999999999
poisons added to the tobacco

4551.6 --> 4558.2390000000005
that was always the cause of it

4554.8 --> 4559.679
always from the start yeah

4558.239 --> 4562.799999999999
cancer

4559.679 --> 4564.64
like what [ __ ] cancer

4562.8 --> 4567.360000000001
you know how long

4564.64 --> 4570.719
how long people have even been smoking

4567.36 --> 4572.48
tobacco in the world yeah

4570.719 --> 4573.4
how long

4572.48 --> 4576.599999999999
like

4573.4 --> 4578.32
300 years

4576.6 --> 4579.4400000000005
300

4578.32 --> 4581.84
years

4579.44 --> 4581.839999999999
yeah

4582.08 --> 4588.32
when did cancer become a problem

4585.36 --> 4590.96
yeah there's statistics of this yeah

4588.32 --> 4594.4
officially recognized statistics yeah

4590.96 --> 4598.04
when did the cancer really get bad

4594.4 --> 4601.199
oh oh wait it wasn't

4598.04 --> 4602.0
300 years ago

4601.199 --> 4604.639999999999
oh

4602.0 --> 4606.84
oh it was like somewhere in the 20th

4604.64 --> 4612.12
century

4606.84 --> 4614.76
250 years later after tobacco had been

4612.12 --> 4617.84
worldwide adopted

4614.76 --> 4620.88
internationally a staple

4617.84 --> 4622.96
for businessmen everywhere

4620.88 --> 4624.400000000001
a common product that everybody was

4622.96 --> 4628.719
using and

4624.4 --> 4632.159
cancer was extremely rare you say

4628.719 --> 4635.28
all that time it only really popped up

4632.159 --> 4637.92
in the 20th century 250

4635.28 --> 4640.719
years later after it had been

4637.92 --> 4644.4
standardized and you still think that it

4640.719 --> 4646.719
is the cause of cancer tobacco

4644.4 --> 4649.36
really

4646.719 --> 4653.199
sounds like you're not really putting

4649.36 --> 4653.199
the data together then

4665.199 --> 4669.44
people died 300 years ago yeah you know

4667.36 --> 4670.88
what the main cause was

4669.44 --> 4673.199
famine

4670.88 --> 4673.1990000000005
war

4676.239 --> 4682.32
that was the main cause of death

4678.719 --> 4684.96
cancer cancer was unheard of

4682.32 --> 4687.679
literally it's like medical history it's

4684.96 --> 4689.52
like yeah certainly the cancer epidemic

4687.679 --> 4691.4
like somewhere in the 20th century yeah

4689.52 --> 4695.120000000001
yeah yeah not

4691.4 --> 4699.599999999999
250 years before that when everybody was

4695.12 --> 4699.599999999999
smoking nobody died of cancer

4700.32 --> 4704.639999999999
because it wasn't

4702.32 --> 4707.92
[ __ ] it wasn't

4704.64 --> 4712.2390000000005
rubber baroned yet and turned into

4707.92 --> 4715.1990000000005
poison sticks to kill people off

4712.239 --> 4718.32
it wasn't that yet that happened in the

4715.199 --> 4718.32
20th century

4718.4 --> 4722.32
that's when certainly all these people

4720.56 --> 4724.719
started to get lung cancer it's not

4722.32 --> 4728.88
because of the tobacco that people have

4724.719 --> 4732.8
been using for 300 years

4728.88 --> 4734.56
it's because of the industrialists

4732.8 --> 4736.159000000001
and what they did

4734.56 --> 4737.92
with modern

4736.159 --> 4739.04
cigarettes

4737.92 --> 4739.84
that's

4739.04 --> 4741.6
what

4739.84 --> 4742.96
caused the

4741.6 --> 4747.360000000001
cancer

4742.96 --> 4749.92
not tobacco that had been widely used

4747.36 --> 4752.88
for 250 years

4749.92 --> 4755.12
in which all that time cancer was an

4752.88 --> 4757.36
extreme oddity

4755.12 --> 4759.76
extreme

4757.36 --> 4762.88
it wouldn't happen like that

4759.76 --> 4765.92
it never happened that would be bizarre

4762.88 --> 4771.64
yeah that all started happening after

4765.92 --> 4771.64
big tobacco poisoned their own product

4781.44 --> 4785.839999999999
yeah

4782.8 --> 4789.4400000000005
it's all there to make you think

4785.84 --> 4792.0
cigarettes black tobacco bad

4789.44 --> 4794.879999999999
combination causes cancer

4792.0 --> 4797.679
look all the research

4794.88 --> 4800.64
the tv they all say it

4797.679 --> 4803.52
yes yes of course it's not a satanic

4800.64 --> 4806.320000000001
ruse to flip it inside out and

4803.52 --> 4810.96
like have entire industries just create

4806.32 --> 4814.0
poisonous [ __ ] out of it then have them

4810.96 --> 4816.0
lobby forever claiming how tobacco

4814.0 --> 4818.4
doesn't cause it which is technically

4816.0 --> 4820.8
right it's their product that causes the

4818.4 --> 4823.759999999999
cancer not the tobacco yeah

4820.8 --> 4827.04
and now tobacco bad

4823.76 --> 4829.04
good tobacco get your cancer yeah

4827.04 --> 4830.32
because they all say it

4829.04 --> 4833.5199999999995
i mean

4830.32 --> 4835.44
we've only been using tobacco for like

4833.52 --> 4839.120000000001
300 years

4835.44 --> 4842.96
and in the last 50 we getting cancer so

4839.12 --> 4846.0
it must have been tobacco all that time

4842.96 --> 4847.52
that caused the cancer starting 50 years

4846.0 --> 4850.76
ago

4847.52 --> 4850.76
you know

4876.0 --> 4882.04

5018.0 --> 5023.36
my rage episode 1317 has like insane

5021.52 --> 5026.2390000000005
amount of views i bet there's like an

5023.36 --> 5028.96
entire colony of trolls just

5026.239 --> 5031.599999999999
having an entire squirt orgies over that

5028.96 --> 5034.4
episode and they should ah

5031.6 --> 5034.400000000001
they shouldn't but

5034.96 --> 5037.84
they would anyway

5038.639 --> 5043.36
it has like

5040.6 --> 5045.679
575 views

5043.36 --> 5048.159
in two days

5045.679 --> 5049.84
i think i got some attention there

5048.159 --> 5053.12
it's probably part of the reason why

5049.84 --> 5055.28
there's more trolls in the chat now

5053.12 --> 5057.199
they all realize that their life is

5055.28 --> 5061.36
completely pointless and they're just

5057.199 --> 5061.36
raging against the dying of the light

5065.84 --> 5072.719
as i snuff it away from them

5070.4 --> 5076.96
like smacking flies

5072.719 --> 5076.96
that just refuse to stop bugging me

5077.44 --> 5083.719
come towards me

5079.6 --> 5083.719
and eventually i will

5085.199 --> 5088.638999999999
take this and then

5089.6 --> 5093.159000000001
that's gonna happen

5107.92 --> 5112.8
what do you call fly without wings i

5109.6 --> 5117.92
don't know an x fly

5112.8 --> 5117.92
used to used to fly a walk no

5118.08 --> 5120.48
terrible

5123.36 --> 5127.0
hey steamy traveler

5136.8 --> 5142.52
just a southern backwoods accent

5139.42 --> 5142.52
[Music]

5149.92 --> 5154.159
right by the way when i do that and i'm

5151.92 --> 5156.159
talking like a

5154.159 --> 5158.08
a dumbass or whatever

5156.159 --> 5159.92
i don't mean that if you just have that

5158.08 --> 5162.719
accent that you're always stupid i would

5159.92 --> 5164.8
never imply that you'd be surprised

5162.719 --> 5166.719
i think that a lot of americans actually

5164.8 --> 5168.400000000001
have like this weird trickery with their

5166.719 --> 5170.4
voice where they just can

5168.4 --> 5171.92
through their accents seem more stupid

5170.4 --> 5173.599999999999
than they are to get

5171.92 --> 5176.2390000000005
like a

5173.6 --> 5179.120000000001
business advantage or something

5176.239 --> 5182.4
like it's weird americans are like

5179.12 --> 5185.92
weirder than they seem

5182.4 --> 5185.92
and smarter than they seem

5186.0 --> 5189.36
but yeah their

5187.6 --> 5192.2390000000005
unbelievable stubbornness and

5189.36 --> 5193.36
pigheadedness often like compensates for

5192.239 --> 5196.36
that

5193.36 --> 5196.36
smartness

5196.4 --> 5199.599999999999
to neutralize it

5206.4 --> 5211.04
more trolls means i'm being effective

5209.6 --> 5212.08
maybe

5211.04 --> 5214.88
maybe

5212.08 --> 5218.12
it means i'm getting to them

5214.88 --> 5218.12
for sure

5230.08 --> 5234.0
okay elise is she gonna keep throwing

5232.159 --> 5237.32
out these terrible jokes then i'm gonna

5234.0 --> 5237.32
have to reciprocate

5237.74 --> 5240.8589999999995
[Music]

5289.84 --> 5292.719
okay

5291.28 --> 5295.679
yeah

5292.719 --> 5297.199
i guess it suddenly just cut out it

5295.679 --> 5301.56
didn't even show me

5297.199 --> 5301.5599999999995
anything or no whatever

5324.159 --> 5328.799999999999
so take it nobody got the joke everybody

5326.639 --> 5331.4400000000005
was all conveniently distracted by me

5328.8 --> 5331.4400000000005
getting mute

5333.04 --> 5336.04
uh

5369.76 --> 5375.400000000001
i didn't say the joke i wrote it down in

5372.4 --> 5375.4
chat

5381.199 --> 5384.48
i mean it would be too confusing if i

5383.199 --> 5385.36
just said it

5384.48 --> 5387.04
it's

5385.36 --> 5388.48
it's not really even for this [ __ ] it's

5387.04 --> 5390.0
more like a

5388.48 --> 5391.678999999999
yeah

5390.0 --> 5393.76
if i would hang around in owen

5391.679 --> 5395.84
benjamin's chat that's when i would just

5393.76 --> 5401.4800000000005
say that

5395.84 --> 5401.4800000000005
because it's a joke down his lane

5435.6 --> 5442.04
so you get it elise

5438.56 --> 5442.04
get it or not

5452.32 --> 5455.88
ah good

5462.8 --> 5467.76
i love it i love it when it works it's

5465.6 --> 5467.76
like

5468.239 --> 5472.799999999999
because of the phonetics of it right the

5471.04 --> 5475.76
end is nigh

5472.8 --> 5478.400000000001
and just a little twist

5475.76 --> 5481.88
and suddenly yeah there's a whole new

5478.4 --> 5481.879999999999
layer of meanings

5491.28 --> 5497.36
how are things currently going with the

5493.52 --> 5497.360000000001
dutch farmer situation uh

5498.32 --> 5504.199
i haven't really noticed anything

5500.08 --> 5504.199
radically different happening

5510.239 --> 5514.48
it seems like

5512.0 --> 5516.0
the dutch farmers are getting a lot of

5514.48 --> 5518.32
support

5516.0 --> 5521.6
all over the place

5518.32 --> 5523.84
like even from within politics

5521.6 --> 5526.2390000000005
like the dutch are getting it but there

5523.84 --> 5528.400000000001
seems i think that they're trying

5526.239 --> 5529.839999999999
they're just trying

5528.4 --> 5532.08
they want

5529.84 --> 5535.1990000000005
they want south holland which is a

5532.08 --> 5537.679
province they want it it has the

5535.199 --> 5539.36
arguably the biggest cities

5537.679 --> 5540.4800000000005
besides amsterdam which is in north

5539.36 --> 5542.4
holland

5540.48 --> 5544.839999999999
and i think that they want to turn south

5542.4 --> 5547.839999999999
holland into like a

5544.84 --> 5550.32
giant city-state

5547.84 --> 5552.719
and because they've just

5550.32 --> 5555.44
they're gonna do it anyway there they're

5552.719 --> 5557.12
still gonna like kick out the farmers

5555.44 --> 5560.799999999999
and i don't know

5557.12 --> 5564.88
how far this is gonna go

5560.8 --> 5564.88
but it seems like everywhere else

5565.28 --> 5572.4
the new world order is not succeeding

5569.76 --> 5574.719
but i had a

5572.4 --> 5577.199
some messaging that in south holland

5574.719 --> 5579.44
they might be

5577.199 --> 5581.759999999999
able to still do it

5579.44 --> 5586.159
and i don't i don't find that acceptable

5581.76 --> 5587.92
by the way it's like no never nowhere

5586.159 --> 5588.96
because

5587.92 --> 5592.08
every

5588.96 --> 5594.56
little little tiny little victory that

5592.08 --> 5597.5199999999995
they get in this agenda

5594.56 --> 5600.080000000001
for every farmer that is kicked out

5597.52 --> 5602.639
wherever it is in the country that

5600.08 --> 5605.199
literally is going to be replaced

5602.639 --> 5608.159000000001
by migrant influx

5605.199 --> 5610.96
literally officially on the agenda

5608.159 --> 5612.719
officially on the agenda

5610.96 --> 5617.4
inacceptable

5612.719 --> 5617.4
we'll have no more of this [ __ ]

5617.76 --> 5622.719
no more

5619.84 --> 5625.679
we already got enough of that

5622.719 --> 5625.679
we're dealing with it

5629.679 --> 5636.159
it is inacceptable and they gotta go

5633.6 --> 5639.360000000001
i want globalism out of the netherlands

5636.159 --> 5642.638999999999

alleged bigots

than to be globalist [ __ ] and have us

5742.639 --> 5746.159000000001
overrun

5743.84 --> 5748.2390000000005

5754.08 --> 5760.08
yeah let's not acceptable

5757.199 --> 5762.96
that's not acceptable

5760.08 --> 5765.04
i mean outsiders are welcome if they're

5762.96 --> 5767.199
ready to adapt if they actually want to

5765.04 --> 5769.36
be here

5767.199 --> 5770.48
not just

5769.36 --> 5771.44

or rob of us

5779.44 --> 5783.04
yeah

5780.4 --> 5785.04
those people can literally be shot in

the [ __ ] head on the side of the

street as far as i'm concerned

5787.28 --> 5791.5199999999995
they have no right to live

5793.76 --> 5798.400000000001
come and visit a country that's not your

native born country

5798.4 --> 5804.239
you better [ __ ] behave or you have

5801.04 --> 5807.6
the right to be shot dead

5804.239 --> 5810.48
that's my opinion you shouldn't civilize

5807.6 --> 5812.4800000000005
it we should be like [ __ ] you demons you

5810.48 --> 5814.718999999999
have no right of speech you don't even

5812.48 --> 5815.839999999999
know what sensibility or morality is

5814.719 --> 5818.08
anymore

5815.84 --> 5819.6
you're a bunch of squirting gaslighting

5818.08 --> 5823.639

not freaking industrially weaponized

5855.92 --> 5861.92
migrant influxes

5858.719 --> 5864.4800000000005
they can [ __ ] off

5861.92 --> 5866.32
go back to your country fix your [ __ ]

5864.48 --> 5870.0
country why don't you actually fight for

5866.32 --> 5872.48
your birth country instead of fleeing to

5870.0 --> 5875.44
other places and just be satanic's

5872.48 --> 5878.48
abusing scumbags

5875.44 --> 5880.839999999999
protected by literal demons that are

5878.48 --> 5883.678999999999
publicly known to be

5880.84 --> 5886.639
demons yeah oh you're taking cover under

5883.679 --> 5887.84
their organizations using their money

5886.639 --> 5890.88
to just be

5887.84 --> 5893.1990000000005
disgusting monsters in other regions

5890.88 --> 5895.1990000000005
that are not your own

5893.199 --> 5896.96
yeah well you don't have a right to live

5895.199 --> 5899.5199999999995
then why don't you go back to your

5896.96 --> 5902.4
[ __ ] country and actually stick up

5899.52 --> 5903.4400000000005
for your own people

5902.4 --> 5906.799999999999
but you go

5903.44 --> 5909.04
use your strength and your fighting lust

5906.8 --> 5912.2390000000005
there

5909.04 --> 5916.56
to maybe get your country back under the

5912.239 --> 5918.959999999999
control of you your people

5916.56 --> 5919.92
instead of just ruining it for other

5918.96 --> 5921.119
people

5919.92 --> 5922.0
out there

5921.119 --> 5924.4

western organizations that are [ __ ]

5926.239 --> 5930.239

5932.719 --> 5937.76
mostly the [ __ ] globalists that are

5935.119 --> 5939.92
literally ruining it for you

5937.76 --> 5942.2390000000005
and they're ruining it for us so you

5939.92 --> 5944.4800000000005
think it's then okay it's a solution to

5942.239 --> 5946.5599999999995
just oh they're ruining it for us so

5944.48 --> 5950.0
we're going to protect that project that

5946.56 --> 5953.119000000001
on the other victims of that same group

5950.0 --> 5955.52
and punish them for what

5953.119 --> 5958.159
the same people that punish already did

5955.52 --> 5961.52
that to them also did to us yeah that's

5958.159 --> 5964.839999999999

5964.84 --> 5969.1990000000005
pathetic slavish than that

5972.159 --> 5977.599999999999
i mean what's more pathetic than one

5974.159 --> 5980.159
slave basically bullying another slave

5977.6 --> 5982.639
of the same slave master for what the

5980.159 --> 5988.759999999999
slave master did to him

5982.639 --> 5988.76
what can be more pathetic than that

6003.679 --> 6009.84
right anyway

6005.6 --> 6009.84
you guys keep on squirting in chat

6026.239 --> 6029.239

[Music]

6088.96 --> 6092.679
okay right back

6093.199 --> 6100.32
take it easy but that also that the chat

6096.639 --> 6100.32
is a bit trollish today so

6107.119 --> 6111.44
what

6109.119 --> 6114.639
some of history is a lie mostly

6111.44 --> 6117.5199999999995
unintentional no no

6114.639 --> 6118.56
that's exactly the opposite

6117.52 --> 6121.6
the [ __ ]

6118.56 --> 6124.0
no most of history is a lie and it is

6121.6 --> 6125.84
all intentional

6124.0 --> 6129.199
i mean

6125.84 --> 6134.52
the erasing and replacing of history is

6129.199 --> 6134.5199999999995
like an important part of business

6134.56 --> 6141.360000000001
it's dave it's business as usual

6138.4 --> 6143.04
false history is business

6141.36 --> 6146.239
literally

6143.04 --> 6149.44
the history is what people reflect on

6146.239 --> 6151.839999999999
for their own identity and self-worth

6149.44 --> 6156.879999999999
and national identity

6151.84 --> 6156.88
to fake it is part of business

6160.639 --> 6165.6
bad archaeology dude

6163.6 --> 6167.119000000001
bad archaeology

6165.6 --> 6170.4800000000005
uh

6167.119 --> 6172.96
yeah how about archaeology is kind of

6170.48 --> 6175.28
like a faking industry

6172.96 --> 6177.28
a lot of it

6175.28 --> 6179.36
not all of it

6177.28 --> 6182.32
some people actually think they're doing

6179.36 --> 6184.799999999999
archaeology and that it means something

6182.32 --> 6187.759999999999
but yeah originally

6184.8 --> 6189.679
archaeology was kind of like a giant

6187.76 --> 6190.400000000001
money scam

6189.679 --> 6194.88
to

6190.4 --> 6194.879999999999
fake and create in workshops

6195.52 --> 6199.76
skeletons of an alleged race of

6197.92 --> 6202.88
creatures that never actually existed

6199.76 --> 6205.679
that has become part of the vernacular

6202.88 --> 6208.0
of atheist cosmology

6205.679 --> 6212.04
that's what a lot of archaeology was

6208.0 --> 6212.04
actually born from

6218.96 --> 6224.88
no not badly performed

6221.28 --> 6230.84
straight on fraud

6224.88 --> 6234.4800000000005
knowing intentional planned and paid for

6230.84 --> 6234.4800000000005
fraud yeah

6240.0 --> 6244.84
there's nothing unintentional about it

6243.199 --> 6248.638999999999
nor was it

6244.84 --> 6254.360000000001
sloppiness no it was blatant

6248.639 --> 6254.36
pre-planned paid for covered up fraud

6267.08 --> 6270.48
[Music]

6268.88 --> 6271.4400000000005
any proof of fraud

6270.48 --> 6273.04
yeah

6271.44 --> 6275.119
dinosaur bones

6273.04 --> 6276.8
are not real they're actually comprised

6275.119 --> 6279.119
of chicken bones that are made in

6276.8 --> 6281.76
workshops

6279.119 --> 6282.719
it was a thriving industry what they did

6281.76 --> 6285.52
is

6282.719 --> 6287.44
could do it for all kinds of reasons

6285.52 --> 6290.320000000001
they would make an event

6287.44 --> 6293.36
would set up media everything then an

6290.32 --> 6295.199
archaeologist would go to some spot

6293.36 --> 6297.44
corner it off

6295.199 --> 6300.0
then workshop

6297.44 --> 6301.36
made all these bones allegedly they

6300.0 --> 6303.119
would be placed

6301.36 --> 6305.599999999999
then there would be a photo op of the

6303.119 --> 6309.199
discovery

6305.6 --> 6311.6
then oh look all investors and news and

6309.199 --> 6314.48
oh like a museum would get

6311.6 --> 6316.08
lots of funding lots of investors again

6314.48 --> 6318.159
because it was also popular and there

6316.08 --> 6321.44
were a lot of nouveau riche that had a

6318.159 --> 6324.96
lot of money to waste was a giant

6321.44 --> 6324.96
money grabbing scam

6327.199 --> 6332.159
no not giant chicken bones ground up

6330.08 --> 6334.8
chicken bones

6332.159 --> 6336.08
chicken bones were like

6334.8 --> 6339.92
crushed

6336.08 --> 6341.119
made into a fine dust and then cast

6339.92 --> 6344.159
into

6341.119 --> 6346.96
whatever shape they needed and they by

6344.159 --> 6349.44
the way would also utilize things like

6346.96 --> 6352.96
whale skeleton parts

6349.44 --> 6352.96
and others on record

6356.0 --> 6359.8
that's what really happened

6361.199 --> 6364.32
keep lulling it up

6369.28 --> 6375.199
right now of course things like uh

6372.719 --> 6377.6
monument building archaeology that's

6375.199 --> 6377.599999999999
different

6379.119 --> 6383.199
but that doesn't even exist all that

6381.679 --> 6388.2390000000005
long i mean

6383.199 --> 6388.239
dinosaur archaeology really came first

6388.719 --> 6393.44
before that ruins were just ruins there

6391.6 --> 6395.52
wasn't really interest like oh we should

6393.44 --> 6399.5599999999995
dig up this ancient [ __ ]

6395.52 --> 6399.56
now that kind of came later

6400.4 --> 6405.04
first there was the dinosaur hype

6403.199 --> 6406.5599999999995
that really put

6405.04 --> 6408.8
archaeology

6406.56 --> 6410.4800000000005
made it into a a

6408.8 --> 6413.360000000001
institute

6410.48 --> 6416.5599999999995
based in secularism that's what put it

6413.36 --> 6418.5599999999995
on the map that giant fraud project

6416.56 --> 6420.8
where they used the nouveau reach to get

6418.56 --> 6423.280000000001

6420.8 --> 6428.1990000000005
fictional remnants of a fictional race

6423.28 --> 6428.199
that is part of the secular cosmology

6430.97 --> 6435.1990000000005
[Music]

6432.4 --> 6437.199
repurpose giant bones no

6435.199 --> 6438.4
no

6437.199 --> 6440.48
no

6438.4 --> 6442.879999999999
they actually completely did try to

6440.48 --> 6445.36
destroy every form of ev they really

6442.88 --> 6447.92
wanted to erase it forever

6445.36 --> 6450.96
smithsonian institute they would never

6447.92 --> 6454.719
recycle giant bones because what if you

6450.96 --> 6458.32
actually then because of that

6454.719 --> 6461.6
retain proof by accident of the giants

6458.32 --> 6464.159
now maybe somewhere in some basement or

6461.6 --> 6467.84
in the vatican library whatever they got

6464.159 --> 6467.839999999999
actual giant skeletons

6468.56 --> 6473.280000000001
but they don't recycle them for

6470.56 --> 6473.280000000001
dinosaurs

6480.48 --> 6485.839999999999
and even like things like using

6483.6 --> 6489.52
bones from whales

6485.84 --> 6490.719
was really only done in like the first

6489.52 --> 6492.719
phase

6490.719 --> 6495.679
of doing all that

6492.719 --> 6496.88
later they just used all ground up bones

6495.679 --> 6499.92
because

6496.88 --> 6500.96
like bones are recognizable that's the

6499.92 --> 6503.28
problem

6500.96 --> 6504.4
somebody that actually knows skeletons a

6503.28 --> 6507.199
lot

6504.4 --> 6508.879999999999
will just be able to look at the bone

6507.199 --> 6512.0
and be like

6508.88 --> 6514.159000000001
that looks exactly like like a bone of

6512.0 --> 6516.08
this and that animal

6514.159 --> 6518.0
it will be recognized at some point so

6516.08 --> 6520.159
they just stopped doing that because

6518.0 --> 6522.639
people would catch on so they all

6520.159 --> 6526.799999999999
grounded it up just grounded up bones

6522.639 --> 6528.96
and then cast it from scratch

6526.8 --> 6531.28
but at the start especially they did

6528.96 --> 6533.28
just kind of like improvise

6531.28 --> 6535.119
because people have no idea what's

6533.28 --> 6537.599999999999
happening they didn't know anything

6535.119 --> 6537.599999999999
about that

6539.76 --> 6544.2390000000005
were there giant versions of animals in

6541.92 --> 6545.92
the past

6544.239 --> 6551.08
absolutely

6545.92 --> 6551.08
oh how giant i don't know

6555.199 --> 6559.199
but yeah

6556.719 --> 6561.52
i'm fairly certain there were really

6559.199 --> 6564.0
big animals of every type we know back

6561.52 --> 6564.0
in the past

6564.32 --> 6568.28
everything would have been bigger

6570.0 --> 6574.4
conditions were better i think

6571.52 --> 6577.679
everything is big bigger i think that

6574.4 --> 6579.04
it's part of the life entropy cycle

6577.679 --> 6582.56
creation

6579.04 --> 6583.92
that everything really started out as

6582.56 --> 6586.4800000000005
gigantic

6583.92 --> 6588.56
titanic and it all just

6586.48 --> 6591.5599999999995
grew smaller over time and it's still

6588.56 --> 6591.56
going

6604.08 --> 6608.04
oh dear dear

6614.4 --> 6619.36
flat earth narrative

6616.88 --> 6623.4400000000005
yeah no [ __ ] dude jarvis

6619.36 --> 6625.839999999999
but the standardized rhetoric from 2015

6623.44 --> 6628.96
about the ladder at what it supposedly

6625.84 --> 6631.1990000000005
is it's a disc surrounded by an ice wall

6628.96 --> 6633.84
and the north pole is a point in the

6631.199 --> 6634.96
center yeah all that [ __ ]

6633.84 --> 6636.96
it's all

6634.96 --> 6639.119
that's just

6636.96 --> 6641.92
basic rhetoric

6639.119 --> 6644.32
from the early flat earth

6641.92 --> 6647.88
it assumes a lot

6644.32 --> 6647.88
that is not proven

6661.119 --> 6666.159
the biggest creature to ever live is

6663.04 --> 6668.4
alive today

6666.159 --> 6668.4
no

6668.8 --> 6671.119000000001
no

6678.48 --> 6682.959999999999
the blue whale yeah

6680.88 --> 6685.36
no there were definitely bigger

6682.96 --> 6688.0
creatures

6685.36 --> 6691.28
but good point the blue whale is just

6688.0 --> 6692.84
insanely large really even for this age

6691.28 --> 6696.719
it

6692.84 --> 6699.719
is it's a giant lar tub

6696.719 --> 6699.719
unbelievable

6726.32 --> 6728.639
right

6731.28 --> 6736.4
but yeah blue whales are not exactly

6733.36 --> 6738.4
dynamic huge creatures or anything

6736.4 --> 6740.719
i mean

6738.4 --> 6743.36
like just getting them out of the water

6740.719 --> 6746.4
just kills them i mean that's not a very

6743.36 --> 6746.4
dynamic creature

6747.44 --> 6751.678999999999
and there were a lot more dynamic

6749.44 --> 6754.08
creatures that were a lot bigger in the

6751.679 --> 6754.08
past

6762.96 --> 6768.0
the wheel is up to the size of 33

6765.52 --> 6770.320000000001
elephants really

6768.0 --> 6772.56
really

6770.32 --> 6774.96
well that's like the red that must be an

6772.56 --> 6778.0
old one then

6774.96 --> 6779.679
i mean they do grow like just insanely

6778.0 --> 6782.32
large but

6779.679 --> 6784.88
33 elephants or are you just

6782.32 --> 6789.239
putting that 33 number in there

6784.88 --> 6789.2390000000005
for fun steamy traveler

6810.4 --> 6814.719
okay

6811.92 --> 6814.719
thank you for that

6819.639 --> 6823.84
approximately

6821.44 --> 6826.879999999999
oh the weight

6823.84 --> 6829.119000000001
yeah i thought yeah that's

6826.88 --> 6831.84
33 times the weight

6829.119 --> 6834.4
not the volume

6831.84 --> 6836.159000000001
because an elephant is like much more

6834.4 --> 6840.879999999999
heavy they're like

6836.159 --> 6844.159
dude it's all bone it's really compacted

6840.88 --> 6847.1990000000005
like i bet that an elephant's density

6844.159 --> 6849.36
the average scoop of piece of elephant

6847.199 --> 6852.799999999999
bone and everything included is probably

6849.36 --> 6856.5599999999995
like three times as heavy as a as the

6852.8 --> 6862.119000000001
same volume of whale

6856.56 --> 6862.119000000001
i mean fat is not very heavy really

6865.52 --> 6870.400000000001
right but when it comes to the weight

6867.92 --> 6870.4
yeah

6873.04 --> 6876.239
wait

6873.92 --> 6878.8
the volume

6876.239 --> 6881.839999999999
right ah

6878.8 --> 6884.159000000001
mixing it up again hey ciao cat good to

6881.84 --> 6884.159000000001
see you

6885.92 --> 6889.28
you wanna plucked paula show in a super

6888.0 --> 6891.84
chat

6889.28 --> 6891.84
okay

6893.679 --> 6896.92
i guess

6928.32 --> 6933.32
okay pgcnet you got some other data

6940.56 --> 6945.119000000001
where do i go to research the real flat

6943.28 --> 6946.96
earth

6945.119 --> 6950.4
you and nathan won't even agree on one

6946.96 --> 6950.4
concept what are you talking about

6956.719 --> 6960.96
i think we do actually agree it's just

6959.28 --> 6963.5199999999995
that i am

6960.96 --> 6966.08
taking my research

6963.52 --> 6967.92
a few steps further while nathan is kind

6966.08 --> 6970.88
of a minimalist

6967.92 --> 6972.08
he's he's just trying to keep his shorts

6970.88 --> 6974.8
sharp

6972.08 --> 6977.76
that's his way of doing things

6974.8 --> 6980.0
like i am like no i'm gonna fill it in

6977.76 --> 6982.159000000001
i'm going to fill it in until i get it

6980.0 --> 6984.4
right i'm just a puzzler i'm just going

6982.159 --> 6984.4
there

6984.719 --> 6990.56
but nathan definitely respects my

6987.199 --> 6992.96
insights he just doesn't like it

6990.56 --> 6994.719
when i just easily row it or roll it out

6992.96 --> 6997.52
on his show

6994.719 --> 6999.76
with the chance that people might reify

6997.52 --> 7002.56
it as if i claimed it is it is

6999.76 --> 7004.719
scientific fact or something right

7002.56 --> 7004.719
so

7008.719 --> 7014.84
if you want to research the right flat

7010.88 --> 7018.719
earth ideas then go and visit my

7014.84 --> 7020.56
channel i mean i talk about it

7018.719 --> 7022.4800000000005
look if you're gonna ask questions i'm

7020.56 --> 7024.400000000001
gonna answer the questions

7022.48 --> 7026.879999999999
i'm gonna answer pretty much every

7024.4 --> 7028.638999999999
detail of anything right

7026.88 --> 7030.4800000000005
i'm gonna lay down where i think you

7028.639 --> 7032.96
might be wrong where

7030.48 --> 7035.36
your view is probably derived from a

7032.96 --> 7039.36
very specific model and the percentage

7035.36 --> 7043.32
of likelihood of that etc etc right all

7039.36 --> 7043.32
you gotta do is ask

7050.8 --> 7054.4800000000005
ah thank you for that stephen yeah you

7052.96 --> 7055.84
could say it like that i'm more bold

7054.48 --> 7059.638999999999
with my thoughts nathan is more

7055.84 --> 7059.639
conservative right

7077.76 --> 7081.679
that's hilarious tara 306 although that

7081.04 --> 7084.0
is

7081.679 --> 7087.119
that sounds like a complete spoof and

7084.0 --> 7088.239
absolutely not true it is still really

7087.119 --> 7090.639
funny

7088.239 --> 7094.48
uh yeah by the way thank you ciao yoon

7090.639 --> 7094.4800000000005
cat for the super chat donation and the

7094.96 --> 7102.4800000000005
i'll do the channel shout out

7098.239 --> 7104.879999999999
live in three hours levels up channel

7102.48 --> 7107.598999999999
the apocrypha

7104.88 --> 7109.92
the septuagint

7107.599 --> 7111.360000000001
and the canon of the bible

7109.92 --> 7112.84
all right

7111.36 --> 7116.48
with the

7112.84 --> 7120.08
link right so yeah if you want to

7116.48 --> 7122.5599999999995
do some bible study stream

7120.08 --> 7126.159
go over at paula's channel to be honest

7122.56 --> 7126.159000000001
i don't really go there because

7126.32 --> 7129.759999999999
i have an opinion and

7128.96 --> 7131.92
i

7129.76 --> 7135.599
what i do is something that

7131.92 --> 7138.8
paula just refuses to accept

7135.599 --> 7141.1990000000005
so i rub her the wrong way

7138.8 --> 7143.84
i think i'm still bad at her so but

7141.199 --> 7143.839999999999
whatever

7147.679 --> 7152.8
what are the wrong flat earth ideas well

7149.84 --> 7154.88
a wrong flat earth idea would be

7152.8 --> 7156.56
jarvis are you paying attention am i

7154.88 --> 7159.52
getting your attention

7156.56 --> 7160.639
the wrong flat earth idea would be

7159.52 --> 7161.84
to say

7160.639 --> 7164.639
look

7161.84 --> 7167.4400000000005
we got the map it's a disc surrounded by

7164.639 --> 7170.159000000001
an isil this is literally what it is

7167.44 --> 7171.759999999999
this is the model right if you say oh

7170.159 --> 7173.839999999999
look this map

7171.76 --> 7174.96
circle projection with an ice wall

7173.84 --> 7175.92
outside

7174.96 --> 7178.96
that's

7175.92 --> 7181.599
the model now that's a wrong flat earth

7178.96 --> 7183.04
idea because it's a reification the map

7181.599 --> 7186.2390000000005
is not the terrain the map is a

7183.04 --> 7187.76
projection there's complications

7186.239 --> 7189.678999999999
with the projection

7187.76 --> 7192.719
all the projections because of the

7189.679 --> 7194.159
nature of how it would made

7192.719 --> 7195.84
based off

7194.159 --> 7197.598999999999
celestial

7195.84 --> 7200.96
angles

7197.599 --> 7203.28
in a in a virtual sphere or demisphere

7200.96 --> 7205.04
in combination with the flat plane

7203.28 --> 7207.119
there's complications because of that in

7205.04 --> 7210.32
the projection

7207.119 --> 7213.119
right so this disk map you get to see so

7210.32 --> 7216.719
many times that flat earthers with their

7213.119 --> 7220.0
dumb ideas reify into the terrain

7216.719 --> 7221.28
it has scale issues you see the terrain

7220.0 --> 7223.119
all the map

7221.28 --> 7226.639
all the lands

7223.119 --> 7230.4
not the scale on one side of the disc

7226.639 --> 7232.88
things are stretch compact on the inside

7230.4 --> 7235.04
it's like too small

7232.88 --> 7237.119
like it's not the scale

7235.04 --> 7239.199
it doesn't actually fit it's not a

7237.119 --> 7242.5599999999995
euclidean

7239.199 --> 7245.119
to scale representation of the terrain

7242.56 --> 7247.280000000001
so there you go that would be a wrong

7245.119 --> 7249.199
flat earth idea it's a very common

7247.28 --> 7252.48
misconception though why is it a

7249.199 --> 7254.799999999999
misconception because of the nature of

7252.48 --> 7258.239
the duality

7254.8 --> 7260.400000000001
between flat earthers and globers

7258.239 --> 7262.5599999999995
when they say oh look it's the disc the

7260.4 --> 7264.96
lights above the disc why they do that

7262.56 --> 7266.84
and why they rush it and refine is to

7264.96 --> 7269.599
give an exact

7266.84 --> 7272.56
counter argument against what the

7269.599 --> 7274.639
globers would say that's why they say it

7272.56 --> 7277.4400000000005
it is said not as a

7274.639 --> 7280.88
accurate statement but as a counter

7277.44 --> 7283.28
argument to the globe cosmology right so

7280.88 --> 7286.400000000001
that's like a typical problem for

7283.28 --> 7289.119
standard flat earthers is they end up

7286.4 --> 7292.799999999999
just throwing counter arguments against

7289.119 --> 7294.4
the globe but in the process reifying

7292.8 --> 7297.84
a lot of things

7294.4 --> 7297.839999999999
that are just inaccurate

7298.239 --> 7302.638999999999
yeah get the [ __ ] out [ __ ]

7303.04 --> 7307.119
so i hope

7304.48 --> 7308.638999999999
that answers your question jarvis

7307.119 --> 7310.48
i hope you're paying attention i'm

7308.639 --> 7313.04
spending a lot of time here explaining

7310.48 --> 7313.04
this to you

7314.55 --> 7318.02
[Music]

7320.0 --> 7327.199
some feedback would be nice jarvis

7324.01 --> 7327.1990000000005
[Music]

7336.17 --> 7342.76
[Music]

7339.76 --> 7342.76
so

7356.0 --> 7360.48
is enough about it known yet to make

7358.239 --> 7364.159
conclusions absolutely there's

7360.48 --> 7367.159
definitely conclusions to be made

7364.159 --> 7367.159
right

7367.199 --> 7371.919999999999
we can't

7369.119 --> 7374.48
get full conclusion

7371.92 --> 7376.8
right because we don't have all the data

7374.48 --> 7378.718999999999
there is a lot of data and there's a lot

7376.8 --> 7380.4800000000005
of conclusions you could draw through

7378.719 --> 7383.599
logical inference

7380.48 --> 7383.598999999999
that's part of what i do

7385.28 --> 7388.719
what are you talking about right back

7390.08 --> 7394.32
no i

7391.119 --> 7396.5599999999995
he is trolling i don't see it doesn't

7394.32 --> 7398.4
seem like it i mean

7396.56 --> 7400.2390000000005
he could be a troll

7398.4 --> 7402.638999999999
underneath it all but everything he's

7400.239 --> 7404.718999999999
said so far does seem just like honest

7402.639 --> 7406.719
inquiry so

7404.719 --> 7409.719
he's asking a question i'm answering the

7406.719 --> 7409.719
question

7413.199 --> 7419.5599999999995
so yeah you might be a bit premature

7415.28 --> 7419.5599999999995
there in your conclusion rig back

7422.48 --> 7426.0
i mean

7423.52 --> 7428.4800000000005
yeah you might be getting an impulse

7426.0 --> 7429.28
like oh he's gonna turn into a troll

7428.48 --> 7431.5199999999995
right

7429.28 --> 7435.44
and yeah you might be right it's just it

7431.52 --> 7435.4400000000005
doesn't have any point to bring that up

7435.679 --> 7440.719
so to just say oh he's trolling yeah

7438.159 --> 7443.598999999999
that that might be something that will

7440.719 --> 7444.88
turn out to be it's just there's no

7443.599 --> 7447.28
function in

7444.88 --> 7450.079
bringing it up now

7447.28 --> 7453.679
because he's not actually doing it now

7450.079 --> 7453.679
i've been premature before

7453.76 --> 7456.159000000001
sure

7460.48 --> 7466.159
right so jarvis yeah

7462.8 --> 7466.159000000001
i gave you an example

7468.4 --> 7473.119
then that's just one example

7471.52 --> 7475.599
right there's more examples there's

7473.119 --> 7477.44
examples of fictional potential

7475.599 --> 7479.599
reification

7477.44 --> 7483.36
right for example when somebody would

7479.599 --> 7483.360000000001
say there's a giant water

7483.52 --> 7487.92
tornado thing

7485.119 --> 7490.32
at the center point of the north

7487.92 --> 7493.28
and when you go in there you end up in

7490.32 --> 7495.28
another realm you end up in the subterra

7493.28 --> 7497.5199999999995
in shale where there's no sun and

7495.28 --> 7499.759999999999
there's the smoky thing right

7497.52 --> 7500.56
we kind of know this story right it's

7499.76 --> 7503.280000000001
been

7500.56 --> 7503.280000000001
written about

7503.96 --> 7508.8
absolutely no proof that any of that is

7507.52 --> 7511.119000000001
literal

7508.8 --> 7514.2390000000005
that or that it's literally still there

7511.119 --> 7516.96
or that it is available within reach

7514.239 --> 7518.718999999999
right it might be outside of the loop it

7516.96 --> 7521.52
might literally not just not be

7518.719 --> 7523.28
connected to our realm space anymore we

7521.52 --> 7524.8
don't know that we don't know any of

7523.28 --> 7526.48
that

7524.8 --> 7528.88
you see

7526.48 --> 7530.5599999999995
so if somebody's just gonna roll out a

7528.88 --> 7532.159000000001
story like that

7530.56 --> 7534.4800000000005
because it's been written about like

7532.159 --> 7536.0
that's already proven

7534.48 --> 7537.44
then

7536.0 --> 7539.76
that's just

7537.44 --> 7542.079
yeah that's bad reification it is the

7539.76 --> 7545.04
perpetuation of myth

7542.079 --> 7547.36
and yeah there might dude there might be

7545.04 --> 7549.5199999999995
something to it right it's very

7547.36 --> 7551.199
interesting who knows maybe one day or

7549.52 --> 7552.96
something like that will be discovered

7551.199 --> 7554.879999999999
it will everybody will see it and like

7552.96 --> 7556.159
what what

7554.88 --> 7558.719
who knows

7556.159 --> 7560.4
but right now two already stated like

7558.719 --> 7562.4800000000005
that is a pure

7560.4 --> 7565.679
architectural fact

7562.48 --> 7565.678999999999
is kind of pointless

7566.88 --> 7573.04
because you really don't know

7569.599 --> 7577.1990000000005
you should only draw conclusions as to

7573.04 --> 7579.599
the data that is within reach

7577.199 --> 7581.839999999999
right if you're gonna conjure up things

7579.599 --> 7584.0
that have no hint

7581.84 --> 7586.8
of them existing except

7584.0 --> 7589.76
through vague remote inference there's

7586.8 --> 7592.159000000001
no point in in just reifying it

7589.76 --> 7594.56
conjuring it up like this is real

7592.159 --> 7596.799999999999
you don't know that you absolutely don't

7594.56 --> 7600.079000000001
know it might be real

7596.8 --> 7602.8
but there is no direct hint

7600.079 --> 7604.48
except for remote inference it's

7602.8 --> 7607.119000000001
pointless to do that

7604.48 --> 7609.44
right i try not to do that

7607.119 --> 7611.759999999999
even though i am dealing with it a lot

7609.44 --> 7613.598999999999
within my looping model conception

7611.76 --> 7615.679
because yeah my looping model

7613.599 --> 7617.599
conceptions yeah there's potential

7615.679 --> 7619.92
entire realms or

7617.599 --> 7621.119000000001
sections that are like disconnected to

7619.92 --> 7623.4400000000005
our space and that might be

7621.119 --> 7625.759999999999
reinconnected there's absolutely no

7623.44 --> 7628.4
direct evidence for this that that is

7625.76 --> 7629.84
actually even happened at any point

7628.4 --> 7632.239
except for

7629.84 --> 7634.56
looking at the maps like where did the

7632.239 --> 7636.638999999999
island with the four rivers go

7634.56 --> 7637.679
why are there maps of that where did it

7636.639 --> 7641.1990000000005
go

7637.679 --> 7643.84
well the looping model system

7641.199 --> 7647.36
has a potential

7643.84 --> 7649.28
answer for what could have happened

7647.36 --> 7651.759999999999
in order for that to have been there on

7649.28 --> 7654.239
the map and now not be there anymore

7651.76 --> 7658.639
right i've at least have options that

7654.239 --> 7662.32
could attempt to answer such questions

7658.639 --> 7665.4400000000005
but i can't state it as absolute fact

7662.32 --> 7667.92
i can't state that there even is

7665.44 --> 7671.44
a loop

7667.92 --> 7674.2390000000005
i have a very strong suspicion there is

7671.44 --> 7676.719
i can't make to be fair i can't at this

7674.239 --> 7678.879999999999
point even make sense of reality anymore

7676.719 --> 7681.92
if there wouldn't be a loop yeah it's

7678.88 --> 7684.88
gone to that point it really has

7681.92 --> 7688.719
there's no freaking dough

7684.88 --> 7691.599
the the the top has to be flat it

7688.719 --> 7691.599
i cannot

7691.84 --> 7696.400000000001
reshape it in my mind in a way that just

7695.199 --> 7698.239
can't hold

7696.4 --> 7701.119
that can hold ground

7698.239 --> 7703.598999999999
it has to be a flat top there is just no

7701.119 --> 7706.48
other choice architecturally

7703.599 --> 7708.0
in my broad view on this subject

7706.48 --> 7709.678999999999
right

7708.0 --> 7712.079
so

7709.679 --> 7714.4
it would almost have to be looping but

7712.079 --> 7716.0
just because it would turn out to be

7714.4 --> 7719.199
looping doesn't mean that i can

7716.0 --> 7722.96
automatically add on all these looping

7719.199 --> 7726.079
adjacent conceptions as if they're real

7722.96 --> 7728.56
if they're absolutely proven right i

7726.079 --> 7731.239
shouldn't do that i should always keep

7728.56 --> 7734.639
them on the side as

7731.239 --> 7736.32
potential things that might be true

7734.639 --> 7738.400000000001
who knows

7736.32 --> 7740.0
something to imagine about something to

7738.4 --> 7743.28
think about

7740.0 --> 7744.48
something to potentially explore

7743.28 --> 7747.28
but not

7744.48 --> 7750.239
proven fact it's very important to

7747.28 --> 7750.239
distinguish that

7750.32 --> 7755.04
between

7752.0 --> 7756.56
actual empirically proven fact and

7755.04 --> 7758.8
potential

7756.56 --> 7761.52
outcomes

7758.8 --> 7763.52
so let's keep them very strictly apart

7761.52 --> 7765.360000000001
and yeah not a lot of flat earthers do

7763.52 --> 7767.360000000001
that a lot of flat earth is just easier

7765.36 --> 7768.719
to know just whoa i've heard of this

7767.36 --> 7770.96
concept i think that's real so you're

7768.719 --> 7773.36
just going to roll it in like it's real

7770.96 --> 7775.04
talk about it like it's proven that gets

7773.36 --> 7777.44
absolute fact well you're making a

7775.04 --> 7779.92
mistake you're reifying

7777.44 --> 7783.5599999999995
when you do that

7779.92 --> 7783.56
hello rob l

7786.0 --> 7789.76
what the hell are you guys talking about

7790.239 --> 7795.28
none of you seem to be talking about

7792.0 --> 7799.159
anything remotely i'm talking about

7795.28 --> 7799.159
what do you talk about feds

7809.119 --> 7812.119
whatever

7819.199 --> 7823.759999999999
i'm able to speculate without jumping to

7821.28 --> 7826.5599999999995
conclusions that's right jarvis there's

7823.76 --> 7828.2390000000005
one conclusion i will definitely

7826.56 --> 7829.92
make though i don't have to jump to it

7828.239 --> 7834.638999999999
it's right there and that is that the

7829.92 --> 7838.159
earth is absolutely probably fact flat

7834.639 --> 7840.88
it is flat is the one trait that is

7838.159 --> 7841.638999999999
absolutely indisputable

7840.88 --> 7845.52
it's

7841.639 --> 7847.52
indisputably true that the earth is flat

7845.52 --> 7850.079000000001
now just because of that geometric

7847.52 --> 7852.96
orientation of the earth's surface

7850.079 --> 7854.96
being very provably flat straight in

7852.96 --> 7856.8
your face doesn't mean that we know

7854.96 --> 7858.32
everything about the realm and how it

7856.8 --> 7859.599
works

7858.32 --> 7861.36
no

7859.599 --> 7863.599
we don't we have ideas we have

7861.36 --> 7866.96
reflections but we don't but the one

7863.599 --> 7870.4400000000005
thing we absolutely know with

7866.96 --> 7873.679
100 certainty

7870.44 --> 7877.119
demonstrable fact is that the earth is

7873.679 --> 7879.92
flat that part we absolutely know and

7877.119 --> 7879.92
can prove

7880.079 --> 7884.239
to any length like wherever you go

7883.119 --> 7886.88
however you're going to do it's going to

7884.239 --> 7889.839999999999
prove the earth is flat the only way to

7886.88 --> 7892.56
try to disprove it is to migrate away in

7889.84 --> 7894.56
your mind into thought experiments and

7892.56 --> 7897.04
geometric considerations and that's what

7894.56 --> 7898.719
all anti-flat earthers do by default and

7897.04 --> 7901.95
they don't even realize that that is

7898.719 --> 7907.999
exactly what they do

7901.95 --> 7907.999
[Music]

7915.04 --> 7917.36
ah

7922.32 --> 7926.639
yeah it's been a good show

7924.239 --> 7928.959999999999
over two hours already

7926.639 --> 7928.96
nice

7930.719 --> 7934.719
i don't think i even really used curse

7933.04 --> 7936.96
words cussing

7934.719 --> 7938.84
or anything today is

7936.96 --> 7943.92
barely

7938.84 --> 7946.079
nice i like that i really like i do it

7943.92 --> 7948.2390000000005
and even when i do it i do it well and i

7946.079 --> 7950.239
do it with power it's like if i'm gonna

7948.239 --> 7951.04
go there then i'm gonna go and add it

7950.239 --> 7952.32
right

7951.04 --> 7956.0
it's just i

7952.32 --> 7958.48
i'm trying to not go there anymore

7956.0 --> 7962.639
i think i made my point i showed what i

7958.48 --> 7962.638999999999
got but i got to kind of stop doing it

7963.199 --> 7966.32
right

7964.159 --> 7968.96
and there's a way to express vengeance

7966.32 --> 7972.32
and anger and all that

7968.96 --> 7973.599
interestingly even without

7972.32 --> 7975.599
cursing

7973.599 --> 7977.28
or using cuss words

7975.599 --> 7978.96
but it's tricky

7977.28 --> 7981.84
so i'm it's going to be a work in

7978.96 --> 7984.96
progress might take me a few more years

7981.84 --> 7986.639
before i perfect it

7984.96 --> 7989.04
because that passion is never gonna go

7986.639 --> 7990.32
away right i'm never gonna let that go

7989.04 --> 7993.04
but

7990.32 --> 7995.04
when things like get

7993.04 --> 7996.4
a little bit too energetic

7995.04 --> 7999.679
it's kind of

7996.4 --> 8000.799999999999
hard not to drop into cussing mode

7999.679 --> 8002.56
at times

8000.8 --> 8004.88
it just kind of happens and everybody

8002.56 --> 8007.4400000000005
gets that it's just

8004.88 --> 8008.4800000000005
i wish there was a way to do it without

8007.44 --> 8010.638999999999
that

8008.48 --> 8012.239
and and still not

8010.639 --> 8015.04
ruin the moment

8012.239 --> 8017.36
and still be honest so i'm gonna work on

8015.04 --> 8017.36
that

8020.159 --> 8024.079
yeah thank you steamy traveler

8022.4 --> 8025.92
and hey that doesn't mean that there is

8024.079 --> 8028.48
good there is definitely going to be

8025.92 --> 8029.679
more shows where i go ballistic it's

8028.48 --> 8032.0
going to happen

8029.679 --> 8033.76
and i i prefer if you wouldn't complain

8032.0 --> 8035.44
about it when it happens because it's

8033.76 --> 8036.8
going to happen if it's going to happen

8035.44 --> 8038.799999999999
it's going to happen

8036.8 --> 8040.4800000000005
just saying on the long run i'm trying

8038.8 --> 8041.52
to

8040.48 --> 8044.0
work

8041.52 --> 8047.360000000001
my way through it all in a way that

8044.0 --> 8051.52
i can still express the passion without

8047.36 --> 8051.5199999999995
ruining the vernacular as it were

8051.599 --> 8053.84
