membership system join button

86.32 --> 93.6
they'll be much appreciated so

90.079 --> 97.03999999999999
whether today is beautiful

93.6 --> 100.479
quite a couple of trails perhaps

97.04 --> 102.32000000000001
but still it's just a little hazy out

100.479 --> 105.119
there not really clouded and there's

102.32 --> 107.36
plenty of sun coming through

105.119 --> 107.36
see

113.28 --> 119.84
and it's really nice and mild outside

116.88 --> 119.83999999999999
even kind of dry

124.24 --> 128.879
so i'm definitely gonna enjoy going out

127.52 --> 132.72
for groceries

128.879 --> 132.72
later after the show

133.28 --> 136.4
it's beautiful weather

136.72 --> 139.68
all right so

140.319 --> 148.07999999999998
it's friday the 19th

144.08 --> 148.08
february 2021

151.92 --> 155.83999999999997
that flat fellow is first in chat and

154.72 --> 159.28
brand

155.84 --> 159.28
is there good to see you

160.48 --> 162.72
so

168.84 --> 171.84
uh

173.04 --> 177.67999999999998
right so yeah yesterday didn't go to bed

176.72 --> 180.8
too late

177.68 --> 183.04000000000002
and as a result i feel really well

180.8 --> 185.12
arrested because i

183.04 --> 187.35999999999999
really made effort to go to bed even

185.12 --> 190.48000000000002
before two o'clock

187.36 --> 191.92000000000002
oh i'm special but i'm gonna continue

190.48 --> 195.04
this because i just feel

191.92 --> 196.64
so much healthier it almost feels like

195.04 --> 198.79999999999998
there's certain

196.64 --> 199.92
typical cycles that accompany with

198.8 --> 202.0
sleeping

199.92 --> 203.83999999999997
that have triggered because of this and

202.0 --> 207.12
i feel rested in ways that i

203.84 --> 209.36
really haven't been in like at least two

207.12 --> 211.68
weeks

209.36 --> 215.12
because going to bed late really does

211.68 --> 215.12
make things different for me

215.2 --> 220.72
so i'm gonna try to keep this up

218.4 --> 226.87900000000002
don't know if i'll succeed at it but i'm

220.72 --> 230.159
gonna keep it in mind

226.879 --> 233.04
yesterday was pretty odd day

230.159 --> 233.04
a couple of ways

234.799 --> 240.72
yeah the flat earth debate was pretty

238.84 --> 243.84
intense

240.72 --> 245.12
there was rumpus and akuma virus getting

243.84 --> 248.159
in

245.12 --> 251.28
and they were both defending this weird

248.159 --> 252.0
it's more like a semantics argument most

251.28 --> 254.319
of you

252.0 --> 255.519
it did already happen in the first or in

254.319 --> 259.59999999999997
the

255.519 --> 261.6
in the live show about how supposedly

259.6 --> 263.84000000000003
things that move upward

261.6 --> 267.36
accelerate down at the same time it's

263.84 --> 271.67999999999995
just it's basically a semantics argument

267.36 --> 275.759
and it's quite stupid because

271.68 --> 279.52
yeah acceleration in a direction

275.759 --> 280.84000000000003
described is only really in a direction

279.52 --> 283.84
that it is

280.84 --> 286.23999999999995
moving that it is moving

283.84 --> 287.35999999999996
so it can't really accelerate in another

286.24 --> 290.479
direction

287.36 --> 292.8
then it would be called decelerating and

290.479 --> 294.479
then rumpus even recognized this when i

292.8 --> 296.56
described that

294.479 --> 298.71999999999997
but then he proceeded to continue to

296.56 --> 301.6
argue for that it was accelerating

298.72 --> 305.36
downward as it is going up anyway

301.6 --> 307.68
it was really bizarre that he would just

305.36 --> 310.24
agree and even call me intelligent and

307.68 --> 313.36
again yeah it's so funny

310.24 --> 314.639
when i do that rumpus usually does give

313.36 --> 316.88
a

314.639 --> 317.759
lit sort of a legitimate comment out of

316.88 --> 320.71999999999997
nowhere and then

317.759 --> 321.68
proceeds to continue double speaking

320.72 --> 325.12
about it again

321.68 --> 327.44
contradicting that and they just

325.12 --> 328.479
kept on for hours the after show was

327.44 --> 331.919
incredibly long

328.479 --> 331.919
last like one and a half hour

334.8 --> 339.36
right hello michael o'rourke good to see

336.96 --> 353.84
you

339.36 --> 353.84000000000003
got green tea with me

362.08 --> 367.84
let's see

371.84 --> 375.52
after that yeah pretty much

375.6 --> 382.24
what's south park game the

379.52 --> 383.84
proceeded with bullish gate 3 and again

382.24 --> 385.759
oh i discovered by the way

383.84 --> 387.11999999999995
the little detail about the game like

385.759 --> 390.16
who cares oh

387.12 --> 390.72
i play it so i care that they put the

390.16 --> 393.6
stupid

390.72 --> 395.12
level cap on level four so i was

393.6 --> 397.199
wondering like yeah why am i not

395.12 --> 397.68
leveling up anymore i've done so much

397.199 --> 400.8
well

397.68 --> 402.40000000000003
that's why so now i know

400.8 --> 404.24
it's really annoying because you have to

402.4 --> 405.44
reach level five to get level three

404.24 --> 409.039
spells available

405.44 --> 412.4
so i'm just very stuck

409.039 --> 412.4
and makes it a little harder

414.96 --> 421.35999999999996
but yeah

418.4 --> 422.15999999999997
it's still i've been roaming through the

421.36 --> 424.96000000000004
underdark

422.16 --> 426.8
level in the game and it's been very

424.96 --> 429.039
interesting and i really like the design

426.8 --> 430.319
they put some very fascinating stories

429.039 --> 434.08
in there

430.319 --> 436.24
with my konits mushroom people

434.08 --> 437.599
and they put down some really serious

436.24 --> 440.319
culture in it

437.599 --> 441.199
and i like that i and i really

440.319 --> 444.08000000000004
appreciate that

441.199 --> 445.28000000000003
it's like my cognites in the underdog

444.08 --> 448.08
are a really

445.28 --> 449.599
fun little species to fool around with i

448.08 --> 452.56
did so myself

449.599 --> 455.039
in my own dnd campaign and it's like

452.56 --> 456.56
everybody was like yay my konits oh

455.039 --> 459.36
they're so cute

456.56 --> 459.84
because i chose those specific mushroom

459.36 --> 463.44
people

459.84 --> 464.08
to be cute these mushroom people were a

463.44 --> 468.24
little bit more

464.08 --> 472.08
freaky my cone it's in in baldur's gate

468.24 --> 473.759
but still yeah they were micronets

472.08 --> 476.15999999999997
i don't know if that means anything to

473.759 --> 477.599
anybody if you know d and d then you

476.16 --> 480.40000000000003
probably have heard of mike

477.599 --> 482.87899999999996
it's but they were in there it was very

480.4 --> 482.87899999999996
amusing

486.879 --> 490.47900000000004
oh look somebody's complaining pants

489.52 --> 493.75899999999996
again

490.479 --> 497.44
plenty of time to play games right

493.759 --> 501.759
because i have this job

497.44 --> 506.0
this job right here this is my job

501.759 --> 509.84000000000003
my job is to have a place available

506.0 --> 514.159
where people can complain in my chat

509.84 --> 516.4789999999999
about things i say and about things i do

514.159 --> 517.279
especially when they claim i have no job

516.479 --> 521.839
even though this

517.279 --> 521.8389999999999
is the job

523.039 --> 535.8389999999999
i get paid for this yeah

527.12 --> 535.839
by google i get an income

536.959 --> 544.7199999999999
right you got a problem with that

541.279 --> 546.88
you're here in chat telling me

544.72 --> 548.399
and the fact that you are here in chat

546.88 --> 552.24
telling me

548.399 --> 557.68
is possible because i am

552.24 --> 557.6800000000001
executing this job this is my job

557.839 --> 560.8000000000001
hallelujah

561.12 --> 565.44
well thanks to this loser that you've

564.24 --> 567.6
declared me

565.44 --> 576.399
it is possible for you to come in my

567.6 --> 579.6
chat and tell me

576.399 --> 584.24
you didn't have to do that

579.6 --> 584.24
michael o'rourke i was addressing him

589.2 --> 593.279
right because these people have

590.959 --> 596.399
grievances

593.279 --> 598.48
and they need to share those grievances

596.399 --> 600.399
because what else are they going to do

598.48 --> 602.9590000000001
you know they have all these things that

600.399 --> 606.8
i said that they say that i don't have

602.959 --> 606.8
yet they seem pretty damn miserable

610.079 --> 613.519
so they have to share it in my chat

612.88 --> 617.2
that's

613.519 --> 617.6
possible because this is my job and i do

617.2 --> 621.6800000000001
this

617.6 --> 624.64
every day right

621.68 --> 625.4399999999999
it might not be a very financially

624.64 --> 627.8389999999999
secure

625.44 --> 629.44
job in a sense that i kept get paid so

627.839 --> 630.5600000000001
much that i don't have to live on

629.44 --> 632.8000000000001
welfare anymore

630.56 --> 633.76
i would like it to get to that point

632.8 --> 637.12
right

633.76 --> 640.72
but it doesn't seem like my employee

637.12 --> 643.6
my employer the one that's giving me

640.72 --> 645.76
this job google is really

643.6 --> 647.279
all up for that for me getting uh

645.76 --> 650.8
promoted as it were

647.279 --> 653.12
among the viewer ranks

650.8 --> 654.0
they don't really appreciate me that

653.12 --> 656.0
much

654.0 --> 657.12
they appreciate me enough to keep me

656.0 --> 660.24
around

657.12 --> 662.8
and entertain people like this that have

660.24 --> 665.04
personal grievances over that some

662.8 --> 668.3199999999999
people on the internet

665.04 --> 669.1999999999999
just might not have a cookie cutter paid

668.32 --> 672.0
job

669.2 --> 672.9590000000001
and instead are doing some lesser paid

672.0 --> 675.519
job

672.959 --> 676.8
like this like providing a platform on

675.519 --> 679.279
the internet

676.8 --> 681.519
in which you can live communicate with

679.279 --> 684.399
the show host

681.519 --> 686.839
vent your grievances potentially or ask

684.399 --> 689.839
questions

686.839 --> 689.839
right

696.5 --> 699.69
[Music]

701.04 --> 704.399
right no i totally get it guys look you

703.44 --> 707.519
have a wrench

704.399 --> 709.49
you see a troll you want to time him out

707.519 --> 712.629
totally get it

709.49 --> 712.629
[Music]

713.36 --> 718.5600000000001
but in reality that's only going to

715.6 --> 718.5600000000001
encourage them more

725.12 --> 729.44
yeah i know tiny one way it is a cheap

727.12 --> 729.44
shot

729.519 --> 732.8
it's not like the first time that's

731.04 --> 735.279
happened like people complain

732.8 --> 736.16
all the time about that and even

735.279 --> 738.48
complain

736.16 --> 740.24
to people that don't live on welfare and

738.48 --> 744.88
then still they say

740.24 --> 746.5600000000001
oh you're so you're such a shitty job

744.88 --> 748.399
you have a shitty job or you had a

746.56 --> 752.3199999999999
shitty job you're only this

748.399 --> 755.44
shitty so they'll use whatever you know

752.32 --> 758.24
and hey if you're really if technically

755.44 --> 760.0790000000001
you would be very famous and rich and

758.24 --> 762.24
all these things and then you would do

760.079 --> 762.8
this then they would tell you how dare

762.24 --> 766.8
you

762.8 --> 769.68
abuse your position and all the wealth

766.8 --> 771.4399999999999
you you've gathered thanks to the globe

769.68 --> 773.76
and how dare you then promote

771.44 --> 775.2790000000001
the opposite right so it doesn't really

773.76 --> 779.2
matter what position you

775.279 --> 782.72
are whether you're a complete bum

779.2 --> 786.1600000000001
or somewhere yeah super rich

782.72 --> 788.5600000000001
or in between the ballers out there that

786.16 --> 792.16
the heavily conditioned people

788.56 --> 792.16
they don't really care

792.56 --> 797.92
they just don't like that you talk about

795.839 --> 798.8000000000001
flat earth and they'll find whatever

797.92 --> 800.56
they can

798.8 --> 802.0
to try to attack you with it to

800.56 --> 806.079
discourage you

802.0 --> 806.079
doesn't really matter where you stand

808.32 --> 813.279
and that's why i tried to just let them

811.6 --> 815.36
vent their grievances to get it off

813.279 --> 817.279
their chest

815.36 --> 818.72
because maybe afterward after they got

817.279 --> 820.8
it off their chest and they

818.72 --> 822.0
weren't immediately poked and then went

820.8 --> 823.92
into full throw mode

822.0 --> 826.0
well maybe then afterward they they got

823.92 --> 828.16
a little bit of intellectual room for a

826.0 --> 831.76
few seconds

828.16 --> 834.88
they might actually switch rails into a

831.76 --> 834.88
more productive

834.959 --> 841.8389999999999
modus modus operandi right

838.8 --> 844.399
i'm very i'm very optimistic that way in

841.839 --> 844.399
that sense

849.199 --> 851.519
okay

853.68 --> 857.8389999999999
i think a jet just light over

862.97 --> 866.099
[Music]

871.04 --> 874.959
yeah i heard about it i haven't actually

872.959 --> 876.6389999999999
seen anything yet

874.959 --> 877.92
i kind of forgot about it you know

876.639 --> 878.48
there's so many of these things

877.92 --> 881.68
happening

878.48 --> 885.839
supposedly and it all turns out to be

881.68 --> 885.8389999999999
garbage every single time

885.92 --> 890.639
but if anybody has the sort of the raw

889.279 --> 892.8
footage

890.639 --> 894.0
they know where i can find that they can

892.8 --> 899.8389999999999
put that in the chat

894.0 --> 899.839
and i'll check it out

906.399 --> 914.399
or maybe i'll probably

910.0 --> 917.279
like jaron usually does friday hangouts

914.399 --> 920.16
later so i think i'll probably just

917.279 --> 922.959
check his show out

920.16 --> 927.8389999999999
he's typically on to the such events

922.959 --> 927.8389999999999
with footage and all that

950.72 --> 957.089
right anyway

953.96 --> 957.089
[Music]

963.19 --> 966.349
[Music]

973.6 --> 981.12
ah thank you ryan everton

977.04 --> 981.12
is that the link

981.36 --> 984.9590000000001
five hours oh my god

986.8 --> 991.519
it looks like it's mostly just people

988.639 --> 991.519
talking about it

992.399 --> 997.839
i don't see any actual

998.0 --> 1000.56
landing

1005.39 --> 1008.71
[Music]

1008.839 --> 1013.36
footage

1010.399 --> 1015.36
it seems more like an assembly of the

1013.36 --> 1025.839
device

1015.36 --> 1025.839
oh wait what's this and some cgi

1029.28 --> 1035.9189999999999
right but thanks anyway

1032.559 --> 1039.52
so i flicked through that four hours

1035.919 --> 1042.5590000000002
with a little the little scroll view

1039.52 --> 1042.8799999999999
but i don't see any persistent footage

1042.559 --> 1044.8799999999999
that

1042.88 --> 1046.64
would be associated with the actual

1044.88 --> 1048.3190000000002
launch or anything there's a couple of

1046.64 --> 1050.88
cgi

1048.319 --> 1052.24
parts and there's a lot of assembly

1050.88 --> 1056.4
footage

1052.24 --> 1056.4
how they are assembling all that stuff

1058.08 --> 1062.799
oh god yeah and there and there is cgi

1060.96 --> 1067.8400000000001
of what it's supposed to be doing

1062.799 --> 1067.84
though that is in there

1070.4 --> 1072.88
that's it

1079.12 --> 1082.799
hey and the cgi is pretty good

1087.2 --> 1095.8400000000001
it's cgi though

1117.679 --> 1121.76
of course there's no footage of the

1119.36 --> 1126.4799999999998
actual descent for good reasons

1121.76 --> 1128.72
really dr ganzo why

1126.48 --> 1130.559
what is it too difficult to just have a

1128.72 --> 1134.0
camera

1130.559 --> 1136.72
on on the the thing

1134.0 --> 1137.12
on the lander on on anything during the

1136.72 --> 1139.039
trip

1137.12 --> 1141.9189999999999
and as it is approaching mars and then

1139.039 --> 1141.919
during the landing

1144.96 --> 1150.88
can't compute therefore cj what are you

1148.88 --> 1153.6000000000001
talking about indifference

1150.88 --> 1155.679
i was referring to the link that ryan

1153.6 --> 1158.8799999999999
eartherton gave me which is from

1155.679 --> 1161.6000000000001
nasa supposedly

1158.88 --> 1163.44
but the only thing that's shown in there

1161.6 --> 1166.559
is talking heads

1163.44 --> 1169.76
people talking about it some footage of

1166.559 --> 1174.0
assembly of the device here on earth

1169.76 --> 1175.679
and then cgi of the process

1174.0 --> 1177.52
of the supposed landing and all that how

1175.679 --> 1180.16
that's supposed to be going but that is

1177.52 --> 1182.8799999999999
blatantly obvious cgi is there's just

1180.16 --> 1186.0
still cameras

1182.88 --> 1188.16
in the middle of the air taking perfect

1186.0 --> 1191.12
footage that makes no sense also there's

1188.16 --> 1194.96
some cgi glitches in there so

1191.12 --> 1197.84
i hope you do realize

1194.96 --> 1200.16
in the fonts that it is actually cgi in

1197.84 --> 1200.1599999999999
there

1203.52 --> 1211.76
they don't do video data size too big

1206.88 --> 1215.0390000000002
what what are you blabbering about

1211.76 --> 1218.0
data size to what do you mean data

1215.039 --> 1218.0
size too big

1219.12 --> 1222.799
what kind of a nonsense is that

1223.28 --> 1234.32
my launch wasn't cgi well the launch

1225.44 --> 1236.4
wasn't in that video

1234.32 --> 1238.1589999999999
right but i'm sure you've seen some

1236.4 --> 1241.679
rocket or whatever

1238.159 --> 1243.7600000000002
take off than moving an arc out of sight

1241.679 --> 1244.799
right supposedly going over the curve

1243.76 --> 1249.28
i'm sure they should

1244.799 --> 1262.72
show that one

1249.28 --> 1264.3999999999999
but it's not in the video

1262.72 --> 1266.08
that's made perfectly clear well i

1264.4 --> 1267.1200000000001
didn't watch the video i was just

1266.08 --> 1271.039
pointing out

1267.12 --> 1271.039
by scrolling through it right

1275.6 --> 1279.9189999999999
the launch was a year ago

1288.84 --> 1291.84
really

1302.84 --> 1306.3999999999999
um

1304.159 --> 1306.4
right

1307.679 --> 1312.24
but i yeah i guess to you baller

1310.08 --> 1315.84
believers now it's it's sufficient

1312.24 --> 1315.84
if you just get good cgi

1316.32 --> 1323.52
it's sufficient

1319.84 --> 1326.32
you don't need to see actual footage

1323.52 --> 1327.039
of the process too much complications

1326.32 --> 1330.08
right

1327.039 --> 1333.84
the data is too big it's too difficult

1330.08 --> 1333.84
yeah yeah sure

1345.76 --> 1351.36
yeah george sanford i think uh

1352.159 --> 1355.919
i don't think they really care anymore

1356.08 --> 1361.84
they they just want to enjoy the make

1358.64 --> 1361.8400000000001
believe little ritual

1363.2 --> 1368.559
and yeah make up excuses as to why

1366.24 --> 1375.84
things are the way they are represented

1368.559 --> 1375.84
right that's that's what they do

1376.11 --> 1379.3
[Music]

1381.71 --> 1384.829
[Music]

1386.84 --> 1389.84
so

1392.64 --> 1397.1200000000001
yeah yeah dr gonzo it is really cute

1394.96 --> 1402.0
it's really cute

1397.12 --> 1405.12
that you're willing to settle for cgi

1402.0 --> 1408.4
not just actual life

1405.12 --> 1409.6789999999999
taken footage recorded footage because

1408.4 --> 1417.8400000000001
of data

1409.679 --> 1417.8400000000001
that part is really cute

1424.88 --> 1428.5590000000002
too big for a live stream to work so

1427.44 --> 1431.919
what about

1428.559 --> 1436.0
just sending the live

1431.919 --> 1438.48
recorded footage in a package

1436.0 --> 1439.36
you know then it doesn't have to be live

1438.48 --> 1441.3600000000001
streamed

1439.36 --> 1443.52
it doesn't have to be oh exactly the

1441.36 --> 1447.12
second it comes in represented

1443.52 --> 1449.12
can just be data transferred

1447.12 --> 1451.039
like a package it can take a little

1449.12 --> 1453.76
longer there might be some

1451.039 --> 1455.679
things going wrong with the transference

1453.76 --> 1457.6
and then oh look this data package

1455.679 --> 1460.64
didn't arrive perfectly

1457.6 --> 1462.3999999999999
crc check right okay so send that

1460.64 --> 1465.279
package of data again right

1462.4 --> 1467.039
it's called information transferring

1465.279 --> 1467.84
right whether it's wireless or through a

1467.039 --> 1471.039
wire that's

1467.84 --> 1474.24
kind of like how the internet works

1471.039 --> 1477.36
with data package

1474.24 --> 1478.32
checking systems right so it doesn't

1477.36 --> 1480.559
have to be

1478.32 --> 1481.6789999999999
live stream data they could have just

1480.559 --> 1484.6399999999999
recorded it

1481.679 --> 1486.159
put it in a data file and then

1484.64 --> 1489.2
transferred that data

1486.159 --> 1490.96
file wirelessly and hey oh

1489.2 --> 1492.72
some trouble transferring it well you

1490.96 --> 1494.799
just take a little longer until

1492.72 --> 1496.0
every part of the data package is

1494.799 --> 1498.8799999999999
transferred

1496.0 --> 1499.2
perfectly right might take a little time

1498.88 --> 1501.1200000000001
but

1499.2 --> 1502.799
hey they had a year's time right

1501.12 --> 1505.84
supposedly

1502.799 --> 1508.24
going there so

1505.84 --> 1509.36
i don't see the problem you know nobody

1508.24 --> 1514.72
said it had to be

1509.36 --> 1517.9189999999999
all live streamed

1514.72 --> 1521.84
could just record the stream

1517.919 --> 1524.88
on on the supposed rocket going there

1521.84 --> 1527.6
and then after it's created

1524.88 --> 1529.1200000000001
the data file out of it should be

1527.6 --> 1533.279
automated

1529.12 --> 1536.3999999999999
then they send the data file

1533.279 --> 1538.48
wirelessly doesn't have to be live

1536.4 --> 1540.48
streamed there should be no problem with

1538.48 --> 1543.84
the size of the file

1540.48 --> 1543.84
at all

1551.12 --> 1557.84
oh believe it anyway well how would you

1553.44 --> 1557.8400000000001
know if if it's not there

1558.24 --> 1564.4
you know how would you know any france

1566.72 --> 1570.0
so yeah if there would be some live

1568.96 --> 1573.1200000000001
footage revealed

1570.0 --> 1575.6
about it yeah we will dive onto it

1573.12 --> 1578.32
and analyze it it's because yeah that's

1575.6 --> 1580.6399999999999
what we like to do

1578.32 --> 1580.6399999999999
right

1581.919 --> 1585.8400000000001
there isn't any though

1621.52 --> 1627.84
and you will shout cgi regardless now

1628.24 --> 1632.0
we will probably shout oh there's

1630.559 --> 1635.44
trickery going on

1632.0 --> 1638.4
and then figure out how but doesn't have

1635.44 --> 1638.4
to be cgi

1639.279 --> 1644.88
now if they would actually use cgi

1642.64 --> 1646.159
and then try to pretend some of that is

1644.88 --> 1649.5200000000002
real

1646.159 --> 1655.8400000000001
physical recording then we'd probably

1649.52 --> 1655.84
notice eventually and point it out

1664.08 --> 1667.36
yes dr gonzo well isn't it isn't it

1666.72 --> 1669.84
crazy

1667.36 --> 1671.6789999999999
how big that market is for people that

1669.84 --> 1673.52
want to be convinced the earth is a ball

1671.679 --> 1676.0
and that you can fly off in outer space

1673.52 --> 1679.84
and then they can imagine their

1676.0 --> 1683.039
sci-fi future how their kids and their

1679.84 --> 1685.279
grandkids might one day go to space

1683.039 --> 1687.44
and then all the adventures in space

1685.279 --> 1687.919
with the aliens potentially one day

1687.44 --> 1691.919
coming

1687.919 --> 1694.3990000000001
and mining mining on the rings of saturn

1691.919 --> 1697.2
or wherever big diamonds and all these

1694.399 --> 1698.559
endless amounts of resources very

1697.2 --> 1710.72
appealing

1698.559 --> 1714.08
to heliocentric fantasists

1710.72 --> 1715.039
so yeah you you think it's strange dr

1714.08 --> 1717.84
gonzo

1715.039 --> 1718.24
i think it's really normal because there

1717.84 --> 1721.12
is

1718.24 --> 1722.88
a huge market for it the investment the

1721.12 --> 1725.76
psychological

1722.88 --> 1727.919
investment that has been made in the

1725.76 --> 1731.44
world out there through schools through

1727.919 --> 1732.3990000000001
media especially media now is just so

1731.44 --> 1735.6000000000001
vast

1732.399 --> 1738.0
that yes the market the want

1735.6 --> 1739.52
for it for the confirmation of the

1738.0 --> 1742.08
teachings

1739.52 --> 1743.679
is high because there's been a lot of

1742.08 --> 1746.32
investment

1743.679 --> 1748.0
so people want that to be enforced

1746.32 --> 1751.279
otherwise

1748.0 --> 1754.24
everything they've been taught

1751.279 --> 1754.72
becomes useless they don't want to feel

1754.24 --> 1757.6
that

1754.72 --> 1759.1200000000001
so they want reinforcement of the

1757.6 --> 1761.84
conditioning

1759.12 --> 1761.84
of the beliefs

1763.52 --> 1768.399
so yeah they given new beliefs and now

1765.919 --> 1770.3990000000001
they are effectively

1768.399 --> 1771.84
holding you hostage with your own

1770.399 --> 1774.2399999999998
beliefs

1771.84 --> 1776.32
by being the arbiter of those beliefs

1774.24 --> 1780.159
the creator of it

1776.32 --> 1780.72
and they can either deprive you and

1780.159 --> 1784.64
bring you

1780.72 --> 1786.64
all despair or just broken stuff or they

1784.64 --> 1787.44
can give you all kinds of hope and just

1786.64 --> 1790.24
tell you it's all

1787.44 --> 1794.0800000000002
cool and just show you a really good

1790.24 --> 1797.1200000000001
potential cgi of how it would be like

1794.08 --> 1800.0
they can do whatever they want with it

1797.12 --> 1800.0
with the believers

1804.64 --> 1809.3600000000001
all goat them in whatever direction

1806.72 --> 1814.32
whatever money pot they need to

1809.36 --> 1814.32
get filled up and you'll do it

1816.48 --> 1823.84
you'll do it just out of peer pressure

1831.48 --> 1834.869
[Music]

1839.88 --> 1843.779
[Music]

1848.84 --> 1851.84
so

1862.64 --> 1867.519
hatred the large hadron colliders

1864.72 --> 1870.96
quickly switch to another subject

1867.519 --> 1873.279
i guess i guess that's fine is it the

1870.96 --> 1879.1200000000001
most expensive project

1873.279 --> 1882.48
is it well i think that originally

1879.12 --> 1884.559
they really did build it to try and

1882.48 --> 1886.559
answer get some certain questions

1884.559 --> 1888.72
answered right in the search for what is

1886.559 --> 1892.48
the smallest particle

1888.72 --> 1896.159
so i think that originally

1892.48 --> 1898.96
might have been extremely expensive

1896.159 --> 1899.279
but it was probably built originally for

1898.96 --> 1901.919
a

1899.279 --> 1902.799
real purpose to really figure out

1901.919 --> 1905.2
something

1902.799 --> 1906.96
then they did it and then they figured

1905.2 --> 1908.72
out wait this is a complete waste of

1906.96 --> 1910.3990000000001
time

1908.72 --> 1911.84
you know we get is a bunch of squiggly

1910.399 --> 1915.76
lines

1911.84 --> 1918.8799999999999
a bunch of lines on a yeah cgi line

1915.76 --> 1921.12
representations and then you have to

1918.88 --> 1922.0
read the bones and then see what it

1921.12 --> 1924.399
means

1922.0 --> 1926.24
subject it to all kinds of mathematical

1924.399 --> 1930.4799999999998
patterns and systems and see

1926.24 --> 1933.76
how you could interpret it right

1930.48 --> 1934.0
so the original thing was probably built

1933.76 --> 1937.679
for

1934.0 --> 1940.64
genuine reasons but then

1937.679 --> 1941.3600000000001
basically a [ __ ] story came rolling

1940.64 --> 1944.48
out of it

1941.36 --> 1947.36
and now they're using it for well

1944.48 --> 1949.279
science divination of the micro world in

1947.36 --> 1954.399
ways

1949.279 --> 1954.399
and theoretics physical theoretics

1954.72 --> 1961.2
theoretical physics so

1958.08 --> 1965.279
that's what it's used for now

1961.2 --> 1966.159
but they didn't know those things before

1965.279 --> 1977.84
they built it

1966.159 --> 1977.8400000000001
they had suspicions

1988.84 --> 1991.84
so

2002.84 --> 2005.84
so

2007.12 --> 2010.1589999999999
what what do you mean aaron brown space

2009.679 --> 2012.0800000000002
feels

2010.159 --> 2014.3990000000001
devoid that modern culture created by

2012.08 --> 2016.48
removing nationalism

2014.399 --> 2018.559
if there wasn't a final frontier in

2016.48 --> 2019.84
space to aim for we'd have to face

2018.559 --> 2024.32
reality here

2019.84 --> 2026.559
people don't like it good point

2024.32 --> 2028.399
well it is kind of it always reminds me

2026.559 --> 2030.8799999999999
of what reagan said

2028.399 --> 2032.08
i think it was reagan that if there was

2030.88 --> 2035.3600000000001
some outside

2032.08 --> 2036.32
threat that all everybody on earth would

2035.36 --> 2037.84
unite

2036.32 --> 2039.4399999999998
against the common enemy and we'd

2037.84 --> 2042.48
finally be one right

2039.44 --> 2044.799
yeah that idea that's right

2042.48 --> 2047.1200000000001
that's also what the alias-centric

2044.799 --> 2049.28
cosmology is being used for and the very

2047.12 --> 2051.359
introduction of the concept of physical

2049.28 --> 2054.639
aliens

2051.359 --> 2055.679
since the 20th century it's all part of

2054.639 --> 2058.079
that

2055.679 --> 2060.079
to draw away from nationalism so it is

2058.079 --> 2062.96
really the replacement for it's a good

2060.079 --> 2062.96
it's a good point

2065.919 --> 2071.679
so from a yeah shift from defending your

2068.879 --> 2074.96
nation against other nations that spirit

2071.679 --> 2079.2000000000003
to defending the world the glow

2074.96 --> 2081.44
against the outside of the globe

2079.2 --> 2083.839
right and the idea is i think it is

2081.44 --> 2086.48
pretty cool it's a cool idea

2083.839 --> 2088.159
if it was real if there was an outside

2086.48 --> 2103.839
of the earth like that

2088.159 --> 2103.839
but there really isn't

2104.56 --> 2110.64
is it too much hard work to cover up

2107.52 --> 2113.28
flat earth no not really

2110.64 --> 2114.3199999999997
it's actually quite easy to cover it up

2113.28 --> 2117.8390000000004
all you have to

2114.32 --> 2121.76
do is teach people how to cover it up

2117.839 --> 2125.599
for themselves you're living proof of it

2121.76 --> 2128.96
you're doing it right now is you

2125.599 --> 2131.92
defending the globe costing

2128.96 --> 2133.68
them a lot of effort and money i don't

2131.92 --> 2134.7200000000003
think so you're doing it right here

2133.68 --> 2138.3999999999996
right now

2134.72 --> 2142.48
for free because you want to

2138.4 --> 2143.76
that's where you've ended up doing this

2142.48 --> 2145.76
that's exactly what they've been

2143.76 --> 2148.079
counting on it's not costing them

2145.76 --> 2148.96
a lot of hard work to cover up flat

2148.079 --> 2155.04
earth you're

2148.96 --> 2155.04
doing it for them by covering it up for

2156.839 --> 2159.839
yourself

2161.14 --> 2164.2999999999997
[Music]

2185.2 --> 2190.96
cleans the spiritual world religions and

2189.119 --> 2195.839
claims of the spiritual world

2190.96 --> 2195.839
now no

2197.359 --> 2202.48
now the spiritual world is there we're

2199.839 --> 2202.48
part of it

2202.88 --> 2207.52
now what religion does is suggest

2205.68 --> 2212.24
certain

2207.52 --> 2216.079
prophecies and logical order

2212.24 --> 2217.04
and then suggests on how to compose

2216.079 --> 2219.3590000000004
yourself

2217.04 --> 2220.8
in the knowledge and all that how to

2219.359 --> 2222.4
deal with it from

2220.8 --> 2224.079
the perspective of the religion that's

2222.4 --> 2227.52
what religion does

2224.079 --> 2232.32
right it's not there to create

2227.52 --> 2232.32
the spiritual world right

2232.4 --> 2235.599
it only does so from the perspective of

2235.04 --> 2238.96
people

2235.599 --> 2242.6400000000003
that categorically deny anything beyond

2238.96 --> 2245.04
the physical materialists

2242.64 --> 2246.16
they're the ones that say religion

2245.04 --> 2248.64
creates it

2246.16 --> 2251.52
because they have completely

2248.64 --> 2255.839
disconnected or never had the senses

2251.52 --> 2256.48
to pick up any of it because it is there

2255.839 --> 2259.68
it's just

2256.48 --> 2262.0
you don't know what to do with it

2259.68 --> 2263.2799999999997
so you ignore it and then you spend a

2262.0 --> 2266.4
lot of time

2263.28 --> 2268.079
figuring out reasons as to why it's not

2266.4 --> 2271.44
there

2268.079 --> 2274.7200000000003
right it's another form of religion it's

2271.44 --> 2274.7200000000003
a religion of denial

2275.4 --> 2278.489
[Music]

2280.32 --> 2284.6400000000003
yeah that's right i'm just going to say

2282.16 --> 2286.7999999999997
it's there that's right

2284.64 --> 2289.52
i have a lot of experience with it i

2286.8 --> 2291.8390000000004
talk about it i reference it

2289.52 --> 2295.599
i lay it out in every detail every

2291.839 --> 2295.599
experience relating to that

2296.16 --> 2301.92
even explain my suspicion as to what the

2299.44 --> 2305.44
experience was in the

2301.92 --> 2308.16
where it came from all that

2305.44 --> 2309.2000000000003
yeah i experience it it's there it's not

2308.16 --> 2311.359
just something i

2309.2 --> 2312.72
literally make up on the spot it's

2311.359 --> 2316.16
something that is

2312.72 --> 2319.68
actively there throughout my life

2316.16 --> 2322.0
and i learn to approach it

2319.68 --> 2324.0789999999997
and then be able to explain it in a way

2322.0 --> 2325.76
that it kind of can make sense to other

2324.079 --> 2326.88
people and they might recognize the

2325.76 --> 2329.5200000000004
elements

2326.88 --> 2331.599
right if you don't have the recognition

2329.52 --> 2333.28
of those elements then yeah you're

2331.599 --> 2335.119
it's just not going to mean anything to

2333.28 --> 2336.2400000000002
you and then anything could seem like a

2335.119 --> 2337.839
made-up story

2336.24 --> 2340.8799999999997
because you don't have the senses to

2337.839 --> 2343.44
figure out

2340.88 --> 2344.4
factors that you could cross-reference

2343.44 --> 2347.839
with your own

2344.4 --> 2355.839
personal experiences because you don't

2347.839 --> 2355.839
have the senses apparently

2357.52 --> 2364.48
yeah but you see you can't physically

2360.64 --> 2364.48
prove the spiritual world

2365.44 --> 2372.56
you can only point out the mechanics

2369.92 --> 2373.2000000000003
of things that are happening that aren't

2372.56 --> 2376.4
explained

2373.2 --> 2379.2799999999997
through physics and for example even

2376.4 --> 2380.839
well physics does kind of address it

2379.28 --> 2383.599
indirectly through

2380.839 --> 2385.44
information which is supernatural within

2383.599 --> 2388.56
physics

2385.44 --> 2391.119
right so if there is such a thing

2388.56 --> 2392.7999999999997
and there is so much that can't be

2391.119 --> 2394.88
explained just directly through

2392.8 --> 2397.119
physics but there are clearly

2394.88 --> 2400.4
non-physical things

2397.119 --> 2401.92
in existence demonstrably

2400.4 --> 2403.92
they want to have to would have to

2401.92 --> 2411.839
conclude that there is more

2403.92 --> 2411.839
going on

2412.95 --> 2417.16
[Music]

2422.64 --> 2429.2799999999997
i mean for example if you can explain

2426.48 --> 2431.2
how let's just say a dog certain types

2429.28 --> 2434.6400000000003
of dogs

2431.2 --> 2437.7599999999998
will start barking when you

2434.64 --> 2438.0
get home but if somebody else comes at

2437.76 --> 2442.079
the

2438.0 --> 2444.4
door they wouldn't do that

2442.079 --> 2445.6800000000003
they only do it with you because even

2444.4 --> 2447.6800000000003
though they can't hear you

2445.68 --> 2450.24
they can't see you probably can't smell

2447.68 --> 2451.7599999999998
you although maybe a little bit

2450.24 --> 2454.8799999999997
but that's difficult because they'll

2451.76 --> 2457.119
smell you even behind closed doors

2454.88 --> 2467.52
they will know it is you so explain that

2457.119 --> 2469.44
through physics then

2467.52 --> 2471.359
right and that's common that's a common

2469.44 --> 2473.52
thing people

2471.359 --> 2474.72
testify to that sort of thing happening

2473.52 --> 2477.68
all the time

2474.72 --> 2477.68
it's just there

2478.8 --> 2483.599
the dog doesn't have to see you doesn't

2481.76 --> 2484.3190000000004
have to smell you doesn't have to hear

2483.599 --> 2487.6800000000003
you

2484.319 --> 2492.4
they will pick up on you

2487.68 --> 2494.24
approaching at a relatively big distance

2492.4 --> 2496.8
they will yeah at a distance they will

2494.24 --> 2500.64
know ah they're coming

2496.8 --> 2509.8390000000004
so explain that through physics

2500.64 --> 2511.5989999999997
go ahead

2509.839 --> 2515.04
or you could just talk about some more

2511.599 --> 2515.04
about sphere maths you know

2515.44 --> 2522.0
sure i guess that's more

2518.64 --> 2525.1189999999997
your field but i just

2522.0 --> 2527.359
yeah i wanted to tell you that you just

2525.119 --> 2531.04
said that

2527.359 --> 2533.92
the spiritual realm is it's not real

2531.04 --> 2536.079
in a way or can't be proven even though

2533.92 --> 2540.2400000000002
i just gave you an example that you

2536.079 --> 2540.2400000000002
can't really explain through physics

2545.68 --> 2552.16
right i can explain it through

2548.72 --> 2555.04
spiritual mechanics though i can

2552.16 --> 2555.52
they pick it up dogs have a special

2555.04 --> 2559.119
sense

2555.52 --> 2563.119
they pick up when somebody's coming

2559.119 --> 2565.839
right and the funny thing is some humans

2563.119 --> 2565.839
have it too

2566.319 --> 2571.2799999999997
well not in the same way for example

2568.88 --> 2573.28
somebody is approaching

2571.28 --> 2574.7200000000003
i can pick it up too and i've had it

2573.28 --> 2578.6400000000003
even with my friend

2574.72 --> 2580.3999999999996
that i phone with that we would think

2578.64 --> 2580.96
about each other in the same time that

2580.4 --> 2584.96
it's like

2580.96 --> 2585.52
okay it's really odd it's just i'm doing

2584.96 --> 2588.48
my thing

2585.52 --> 2590.079
whatever it is whatever i feel and then

2588.48 --> 2592.319
suddenly it's like

2590.079 --> 2594.1600000000003
somebody's ringing me up spiritually

2592.319 --> 2597.04
it's like uh

2594.16 --> 2598.0
i think she wants to tell me something

2597.04 --> 2600.48
and guess what

2598.0 --> 2601.44
just a few minutes later the phone rings

2600.48 --> 2607.599
and it's her

2601.44 --> 2621.839
yeah explain that through physics

2607.599 --> 2621.839
why won't you huh

2622.0 --> 2628.24
oh really so how about my smell

2626.16 --> 2631.44
how about my smell of somebody on the

2628.24 --> 2631.4399999999996
other side of the country

2632.16 --> 2637.04
that i feel they're gonna call me up and

2634.96 --> 2638.319
then they call me up how about that one

2637.04 --> 2640.0
tiny womble

2638.319 --> 2641.7599999999998
i don't think that has anything to do

2640.0 --> 2642.8
with the smell and i already addressed

2641.76 --> 2647.2000000000003
it that your

2642.8 --> 2647.2000000000003
dog smell underestimate sure

2647.28 --> 2650.5600000000004
still behind closed doors you know and

2649.119 --> 2663.839
it's still like the person is

2650.56 --> 2663.839
in a car and all that so

2666.72 --> 2671.1189999999997
so you assume spirit how is it a

2669.04 --> 2674.24
coincidence

2671.119 --> 2676.48
how the hell is it a coincidence that

2674.24 --> 2678.0789999999997
what i just described that literally i'm

2676.48 --> 2681.2
just doing my own thing and then

2678.079 --> 2685.2000000000003
suddenly i get the feeling like as

2681.2 --> 2687.2
if somebody is like i am in engaging

2685.2 --> 2688.7999999999997
in a telephone conversation without it

2687.2 --> 2691.839
physically happening

2688.8 --> 2692.4
and then like it reminds me like oh this

2691.839 --> 2695.7599999999998
person

2692.4 --> 2695.76
and then they call me up so

2696.079 --> 2707.599
how is that coincidence in any form

2704.48 --> 2711.28
how can i tell when that happens

2707.599 --> 2711.28
that it is going to happen

2715.359 --> 2718.64
you don't just randomly think of

2718.0 --> 2721.28
something

2718.64 --> 2723.2799999999997
is going to happen and then it happens

2721.28 --> 2726.0
there's no physical explanation you can

2723.28 --> 2728.079
attribute

2726.0 --> 2730.24
that to randomness because it is

2728.079 --> 2732.5600000000004
literally something that happens out of

2730.24 --> 2734.9599999999996
absolutely nothing

2732.56 --> 2735.599
it's not like oh you had you do

2734.96 --> 2738.64
something you

2735.599 --> 2739.6800000000003
throw a dice and then it's this that or

2738.64 --> 2742.16
that or that and then

2739.68 --> 2742.72
and you know this is coming out of that

2742.16 --> 2744.56
thing that

2742.72 --> 2746.56
is absolutely certain to come because

2744.56 --> 2748.48
you are going gonna throw the dice right

2746.56 --> 2749.599
this is different this is no i'm not

2748.48 --> 2753.2
thinking about it

2749.599 --> 2755.839
and then suddenly that happens right

2753.2 --> 2758.72
out of nowhere you can't attribute that

2755.839 --> 2758.72
to randomness

2758.88 --> 2761.839
let's stay real here

2769.28 --> 2775.2000000000003
is a coincidence it's a coincidence you

2771.839 --> 2777.68
keep yelling dr gonzo it's a coincidence

2775.2 --> 2780.0789999999997
it's a coincidence yeah life is so

2777.68 --> 2784.0789999999997
filled with coincidences

2780.079 --> 2787.44
it's like like nothing ever

2784.079 --> 2788.8
just happens because there is something

2787.44 --> 2792.7200000000003
there it's all just

2788.8 --> 2795.92
random and incidents and yeah

2792.72 --> 2799.1189999999997
well you know coincidence

2795.92 --> 2801.52
accident random these are all

2799.119 --> 2803.839
things that are generally attributed to

2801.52 --> 2807.7599999999998
chaos and i know this one thing

2803.839 --> 2811.52
about chaos through wisdom that is

2807.76 --> 2816.6400000000003
chaos is order

2811.52 --> 2821.28
that you can't see yeah

2816.64 --> 2824.319
there is no chaos chaos is

2821.28 --> 2826.8
lack of cohesion by the

2824.319 --> 2828.839
information recipient they can't make

2826.8 --> 2830.6400000000003
sense out of it and then it becomes

2828.839 --> 2832.96
chaos

2830.64 --> 2834.56
when you don't understand something it

2832.96 --> 2836.079
is chaotic to you

2834.56 --> 2839.2
you can't assimilate it because you

2836.079 --> 2841.2000000000003
can't figure out it's chaotic

2839.2 --> 2842.72
there's things about it that just won't

2841.2 --> 2846.3999999999996
fit right

2842.72 --> 2848.3999999999996
it's chaos chaos is simply the inability

2846.4 --> 2852.319
to figure out the order

2848.4 --> 2853.2000000000003
within it there are no coincidences

2852.319 --> 2856.839
that's right

2853.2 --> 2858.24
technically there aren't seeking star

2856.839 --> 2861.92
wars

2858.24 --> 2861.9199999999996
now you can still socially

2862.72 --> 2868.5589999999997
think of coincidences and make that kind

2866.079 --> 2871.76
of a part of your composure

2868.559 --> 2873.52
and then it's fine but in my opinion

2871.76 --> 2877.119
technically there aren't really any

2873.52 --> 2877.119
coincidences not really

2883.28 --> 2886.4
yeah well thank you dr gonzo for

2885.28 --> 2890.88
confirming that

2886.4 --> 2890.88
thank you thank you for literally

2890.96 --> 2901.839
confirming what i just said

2907.34 --> 2914.42
[Music]

2916.81 --> 2919.86
[Music]

2921.76 --> 2929.8390000000004
but thinking that you could feel when

2923.839 --> 2929.839
someone yeah it's just a coincidence

2934.72 --> 2938.8799999999997
it's just a coincidence oh just random

2938.24 --> 2941.04
you know

2938.88 --> 2942.079
what about all those time i think of it

2941.04 --> 2944.48
and they don't call

2942.079 --> 2946.8
oh you mean those times that never

2944.48 --> 2946.8
happen

2949.44 --> 2952.7200000000003
you know why because i can distinguish

2951.839 --> 2955.2799999999997
when

2952.72 --> 2956.0789999999997
sometimes i think of like oh i wanna

2955.28 --> 2959.52
call

2956.079 --> 2963.3590000000004
but that's a different type of feeling

2959.52 --> 2966.88
and it comes from within me so then

2963.359 --> 2968.7999999999997
the sensation is literally a response to

2966.88 --> 2970.559
myself

2968.8 --> 2972.6400000000003
it's not the same type of spiritual

2970.559 --> 2974.6400000000003
experience now what i'm referring to is

2972.64 --> 2977.52
when you're completely

2974.64 --> 2979.68
engaged in something else it's like i'm

2977.52 --> 2980.0
watching a video i'm in a chat somewhere

2979.68 --> 2983.04
and

2980.0 --> 2985.839
not thinking about that person and then

2983.04 --> 2985.839
suddenly

2987.599 --> 2999.839
i feel a presence spiritually

2991.52 --> 2999.839
it distracts me and then they call up

3001.92 --> 3005.599
i've studied this sort of thing to no

3003.92 --> 3012.5
end okay

3005.599 --> 3015.65
i study my spiritual experiences

3012.5 --> 3015.65
[Music]

3022.45 --> 3027.839
[Music]

3024.839 --> 3027.839
hmm

3035.04 --> 3042.88
is subjective feeling physical no

3038.8 --> 3044.4
no did i say it's physical

3042.88 --> 3046.319
why are you saying it's physical i'm

3044.4 --> 3048.48
saying spiritual

3046.319 --> 3050.4
falls rather within the supernatural and

3048.48 --> 3054.88
the information category

3050.4 --> 3058.1600000000003
within physics right

3054.88 --> 3060.0
but it's not a lot you can do with the

3058.16 --> 3060.64
supernatural within physics you can

3060.0 --> 3063.599
recognize

3060.64 --> 3065.04
it's there figure out which part is

3063.599 --> 3068.319
supernatural which part

3065.04 --> 3071.359
is physical you can't really

3068.319 --> 3083.839
perform physics on

3071.359 --> 3083.839
things like information

3096.96 --> 3104.559
subjective can be scientific no

3100.24 --> 3107.7599999999998
no not in physics subjective

3104.559 --> 3111.52
no no science

3107.76 --> 3125.8390000000004
is objective it's not subjective

3111.52 --> 3125.839
vowel and canon

3134.0 --> 3138.96
what i

3137.119 --> 3141.28
what are you talking about stone monkey

3138.96 --> 3141.28
3d

3143.599 --> 3153.839
james randy challenge never heard of it

3162.96 --> 3167.28
we can absolutely detect human thought

3165.68 --> 3169.44
processes

3167.28 --> 3171.0400000000004
right but the thought processes aren't

3169.44 --> 3175.44
the thoughts though

3171.04 --> 3179.119
they're just activity that accompanies

3175.44 --> 3183.76
the thoughts because the thoughts

3179.119 --> 3183.76
themselves you know

3185.76 --> 3192.48
technology i i think at least

3189.599 --> 3192.96
publicly it's not progress as far as

3192.48 --> 3195.839
that

3192.96 --> 3198.64
literal thought patterns can be

3195.839 --> 3202.48
externally analyzed

3198.64 --> 3202.48
or yeah might be wrong

3204.8 --> 3209.8390000000004
it's not being utilized as far as i know

3210.64 --> 3214.0
but it's still the patterns it's still

3212.559 --> 3217.119
patterns of energy

3214.0 --> 3223.839
and activity it's not

3217.119 --> 3223.839
the information itself

3224.8 --> 3228.48
hey hello steamy traveler by the way

3227.52 --> 3232.4
yeah lots of people

3228.48 --> 3235.839
got leaking it got into the chat

3232.4 --> 3236.1600000000003
wow i'm engaging in ballers with ballers

3235.839 --> 3238.48
and

3236.16 --> 3239.92
yeah don't keep perfect track of who's

3238.48 --> 3251.839
in there in the chat but my chat's

3239.92 --> 3251.839
pretty active right now

3254.48 --> 3259.2
proof of paranormal or supernatural

3256.64 --> 3264.7999999999997
ability could win you

3259.2 --> 3266.5589999999997
one million dollars oh really

3264.8 --> 3268.7200000000003
but there has been proofs of

3266.559 --> 3269.44
supernatural abilities literally been

3268.72 --> 3272.72
tested

3269.44 --> 3274.4
like officially in in a experimental

3272.72 --> 3277.4399999999996
setup

3274.4 --> 3280.1600000000003
where they would test physiological

3277.44 --> 3280.16
responses

3281.359 --> 3285.119
like mother and child or two people in

3284.4 --> 3287.92
love

3285.119 --> 3290.1600000000003
not in the same room remember and then

3287.92 --> 3292.2400000000002
one is being subjected to certain types

3290.16 --> 3295.04
of things that would typically induce

3292.24 --> 3298.319
certain sensations

3295.04 --> 3301.68
and the other one not in the same room

3298.319 --> 3302.5589999999997
not hearing any of it not seeing any of

3301.68 --> 3307.04
it

3302.559 --> 3310.88
would get a physiological response so

3307.04 --> 3313.68
that's official how about that one stone

3310.88 --> 3313.6800000000003
monkey 3d

3313.76 --> 3318.2400000000002
now you might not call this supernatural

3316.48 --> 3321.119
because yeah that's normal that always

3318.24 --> 3323.839
happens oh but what is it though

3321.119 --> 3324.96
pretty sure it is a supernatural ability

3323.839 --> 3329.359
that is

3324.96 --> 3329.359
natural it's part of life

3332.88 --> 3335.839
so how about that one

3347.62 --> 3350.77
[Music]

3353.03 --> 3356.2490000000003
[Music]

3380.72 --> 3391.839
proof of telepathy what

3392.799 --> 3395.92
i think i know what you mean i don't

3394.64 --> 3398.16
know if you would

3395.92 --> 3401.119
if that could be called telepathy though

3398.16 --> 3401.1189999999997
it is rather that

3401.76 --> 3405.8390000000004
like more physiological

3406.559 --> 3415.28
it's not really like reasoning thoughts

3409.599 --> 3417.44
virtual it's more like physiological

3415.28 --> 3419.8390000000004
responses could be communicated over

3417.44 --> 3419.839
distance

3420.4 --> 3427.92
as far as i remember seeking star water

3423.92 --> 3427.92
so is that actually telepathy

3428.24 --> 3433.359
i think it's more in the direction of

3430.839 --> 3447.839
empathy

3433.359 --> 3447.839
over distance though it's pretty weird

3452.0 --> 3461.839
right yes dr gonzo i know that i know

3463.04 --> 3475.839
it's weird how that works out

3476.079 --> 3479.8390000000004
language is impossible without telepathy

3478.72 --> 3489.839
i'm

3479.839 --> 3489.839
one why do you say that

3499.839 --> 3506.16
i i kind of disagree with that part

3504.0 --> 3508.4
you don't have to spiritually connect in

3506.16 --> 3510.24
order to communicate

3508.4 --> 3513.44
although it does help because the spirit

3510.24 --> 3516.72
typically helps you with the esoterics

3513.44 --> 3519.2000000000003
is it's like empathy you you get into

3516.72 --> 3521.68
the other one mechanically and try to

3519.2 --> 3524.319
figure out

3521.68 --> 3526.5589999999997
where it's coming from so it does help

3524.319 --> 3526.5589999999997
you

3528.96 --> 3545.839
but that's not literal telepathy

3553.52 --> 3557.68
yeah dr gonzo look i don't know exactly

3556.079 --> 3559.76
how that was tested

3557.68 --> 3560.72
but i don't think it's universal that

3559.76 --> 3562.7990000000004
computers can

3560.72 --> 3564.64
always predict exactly where you're

3562.799 --> 3567.52
going

3564.64 --> 3570.48
i think that in our decision making

3567.52 --> 3574.079
process and how we go about

3570.48 --> 3577.04
it's like before things come to our

3574.079 --> 3579.44
actual consciousness land there so that

3577.04 --> 3582.72
we become aware of it there are pre

3579.44 --> 3585.68
signs to it so it's kind of like

3582.72 --> 3586.3999999999996
your subconscious decides before you

3585.68 --> 3588.48
decide

3586.4 --> 3589.44
and then it rolls out certain things and

3588.48 --> 3591.599
then it hits your

3589.44 --> 3592.48
your actual awareness right and

3591.599 --> 3596.88
computers

3592.48 --> 3598.88
can know how can figure that process out

3596.88 --> 3600.6400000000003
they've managed to analyze how that

3598.88 --> 3604.799
works and then they can predict

3600.64 --> 3604.799
before your very consciousness

3605.839 --> 3611.52
but that doesn't mean that you suddenly

3608.079 --> 3611.52
don't have a choice anymore

3613.04 --> 3620.079
you know computer can't predict

3617.04 --> 3622.88
the choices a person will make

3620.079 --> 3625.3590000000004
unless they're just an auto piloting

3622.88 --> 3627.76
numpty

3625.359 --> 3630.48
and they just always persistently pick

3627.76 --> 3632.6400000000003
in a very specific pattern

3630.48 --> 3633.92
like they're not very elaborate and

3632.64 --> 3643.839
complicated

3633.92 --> 3643.839
in their conscious and in their identity

3660.85 --> 3664.1
[Music]

3664.72 --> 3668.8799999999997
uh george sanford oh but that's

3666.64 --> 3672.0789999999997
different

3668.88 --> 3672.079
that's literally the

3672.24 --> 3677.68
well the resonance it's the the

3674.559 --> 3677.6800000000003
frequencies the

3677.839 --> 3682.16
yeah the subsonic oscillations whatever

3680.48 --> 3684.48
that exactly is

3682.16 --> 3685.5989999999997
it's just the presence of certain types

3684.48 --> 3687.599
of feelings

3685.599 --> 3689.44
even though if even if you don't say

3687.599 --> 3692.96
anything the spirit

3689.44 --> 3699.839
radiates it out and that affects

3692.96 --> 3699.839
others around it

3714.72 --> 3719.1189999999997
right that's just the the influence of

3717.359 --> 3721.52
matter

3719.119 --> 3722.4
matter is influence especially matter

3721.52 --> 3727.839
that involves

3722.4 --> 3727.839
life and rice is life of course

3730.079 --> 3735.52
so especially organic matter

3733.2 --> 3737.52
whether it has a consciousness or not is

3735.52 --> 3741.839
influenced

3737.52 --> 3741.839
by the spirit

3743.92 --> 3747.76
hey arochimaru

3748.16 --> 3755.839
have i read about edgar

3751.44 --> 3755.839
cayce no never heard of it

3757.76 --> 3769.8390000000004
what is that

3782.079 --> 3784.4
huh

3794.839 --> 3797.839
wow

3804.48 --> 3813.76
holy [ __ ]

3811.359 --> 3813.7599999999998
dude

3814.4 --> 3818.88
that's pretty incredible i didn't know

3817.44 --> 3823.039
never heard of that guy but

3818.88 --> 3825.839
yeah sounds kind of familiar

3823.039 --> 3825.8390000000004
holy [ __ ]

3826.319 --> 3833.839
that's 1910

3829.359 --> 3833.839
that's so typical it's like a peak

3836.839 --> 3839.839
tertaria

3844.96 --> 3853.839
fascinating how did you pick up on that

3848.4 --> 3853.839
steamy traveler

3873.29 --> 3876.7799999999997
[Music]

3881.92 --> 3885.76
okay that that's kind of funny basic but

3885.2 --> 3887.359
funny

3885.76 --> 3889.92
what's the difference between a hippo

3887.359 --> 3891.839
and a zippo one's heavy and the other is

3889.92 --> 3895.839
a little lighter yeah yeah yeah

3891.839 --> 3895.839
that's a good one

3908.48 --> 3911.359
oh it's casey

3911.599 --> 3914.7200000000003
why didn't he why wasn't his name just

3913.68 --> 3917.9199999999996
casey why it

3914.72 --> 3923.839
has to be with a y and c e

3917.92 --> 3923.839
it's just confusing

3936.96 --> 3943.119
that's so funny biographer gave him the

3940.88 --> 3946.2400000000002
name the sleeping prophet

3943.119 --> 3947.839
it's so bizarre because that reminds me

3946.24 --> 3949.839
of

3947.839 --> 3951.68
the indie game where there is also a

3949.839 --> 3953.92
sleeping prophet who happens to be an

3951.68 --> 3956.8799999999997
angel

3953.92 --> 3960.16
waiting in hell for his true love yeah

3956.88 --> 3960.1600000000003
it's in never winter nights

3961.44 --> 3968.16
but yeah this is pretty astounding

3964.799 --> 3968.16
like even the subjects

3968.4 --> 3974.0
and he would say he channeled it from

3970.96 --> 3974.0
his higher self

3976.88 --> 3980.88
well in ways that's kind of what i'm

3980.16 --> 3983.5989999999997
doing

3980.88 --> 3984.96
except i don't i haven't really

3983.599 --> 3988.1600000000003
separated them

3984.96 --> 3989.28
as much i've really tried to kind of

3988.16 --> 3992.319
entangle

3989.28 --> 3995.039
directly with my higher self it's more

3992.319 --> 3997.359
it's not somebody i step to like a

3995.039 --> 3999.5200000000004
throne who is above my regular self it's

3997.359 --> 4003.5989999999997
more like we're partners

3999.52 --> 4007.839
except he has his own idea about what's

4003.599 --> 4007.839
best for me

4010.96 --> 4015.119
i was in the press a lot back in day

4016.72 --> 4021.839
i can't imagine what my life would be

4018.72 --> 4021.839
like if i was in the press

4022.0 --> 4024.48
like that

4033.44 --> 4037.119
i think that my life would be very

4046.839 --> 4049.839
different

4072.96 --> 4076.88
i have to hear that was that for jumping

4075.52 --> 4082.24
on the hype train about

4076.88 --> 4082.2400000000002
casey what about it i'm not on any hype

4088.839 --> 4091.839
train

4130.839 --> 4133.839
so

4159.679 --> 4161.839
well

4166.4 --> 4171.5199999999995
dude i gotta read some of this [ __ ] like

4169.359 --> 4173.279
this guy talks about a lot of things

4171.52 --> 4176.400000000001
that i like to talk about

4173.279 --> 4180.719
exactly filled it all in for these

4176.4 --> 4180.719
things fascinating

4183.6 --> 4189.839
what on youtube

4190.319 --> 4203.84
foundation archives huh

4204.56 --> 4207.76
i'm gonna ask my healer about this guy

4206.719 --> 4210.2390000000005
he should probably

4207.76 --> 4213.360000000001
have heard of him really curious as to

4210.239 --> 4213.36
what he thinks about that

4214.56 --> 4219.1990000000005
this is really interesting thanks for

4216.56 --> 4219.1990000000005
bringing that up

4226.32 --> 4232.639999999999
yes dr gonzo it is a thing

4230.48 --> 4234.4
don't give a [ __ ] if people believe in

4232.64 --> 4235.92
it or not you know people believe in a

4234.4 --> 4239.599999999999
freaking globe even though

4235.92 --> 4240.159
every aspect about it is pointed out as

4239.6 --> 4242.0
false

4240.159 --> 4243.599999999999
people believe it anyway so if people

4242.0 --> 4246.239
can believe in a globe

4243.6 --> 4248.719
you'll bet ya people believe in

4246.239 --> 4259.839999999999
clairvoyance and all kinds of things

4248.719 --> 4259.84
that's right

4262.64 --> 4267.04
why not ask wikipedia about marsh rovers

4265.44 --> 4269.759999999999
if you readily believe it

4267.04 --> 4272.0
no i don't readily believe it you don't

4269.76 --> 4275.76
seem to understand what believing really

4272.0 --> 4278.8
entails like that right so i know

4275.76 --> 4281.679
the mars rover is not on mars even

4278.8 --> 4283.76
though wikipedia might be telling me to

4281.679 --> 4286.0
because in order for that to happen

4283.76 --> 4288.8
there would have to be an outer space

4286.0 --> 4291.199
vacuum to go through to reach this

4288.8 --> 4293.84
supposed other body

4291.199 --> 4295.839999999999
physical body out there and that can't

4293.84 --> 4300.56
be

4295.84 --> 4304.4800000000005
because we're breathing it's impossible

4300.56 --> 4307.679
it's a very basic logical

4304.48 --> 4311.28
consequence so

4307.679 --> 4314.159
yeah you know wikipedia could be

4311.28 --> 4318.239
telling me that i don't know they found

4314.159 --> 4321.04
a unicorn genetic sample and they're now

4318.239 --> 4323.04
like cloning it or whatever kind of like

4321.04 --> 4324.32
the jurassic park story and with

4323.04 --> 4328.8
unicorns

4324.32 --> 4329.679
would you believe that like if there was

4328.8 --> 4332.719
like a

4329.679 --> 4334.0
unicorn actually bred would you just

4332.719 --> 4335.84
take it for granted

4334.0 --> 4338.0
even if you could see it yourself

4335.84 --> 4342.32
wouldn't you walk up to that horn

4338.0 --> 4344.719
and test if that was actually fixed

4342.32 --> 4346.719
maybe get a genetic sample even if even

4344.719 --> 4349.04
it is just a horse that has been

4346.719 --> 4353.76
genetically modified slightly

4349.04 --> 4356.96
like would you just believe that right

4353.76 --> 4358.08
because whether you believe something or

4356.96 --> 4361.44
not

4358.08 --> 4362.64
should be connected to the wider body of

4361.44 --> 4366.159
knowledge that you've

4362.64 --> 4369.1990000000005
gathered and then you test

4366.159 --> 4371.839999999999
for natural consequences is this even

4369.199 --> 4371.839999999999
possible

4372.32 --> 4375.599999999999
could it be possible

4376.8 --> 4380.4800000000005
and you cross reference with everything

4378.64 --> 4382.08
you've learned and then you can basic

4380.48 --> 4385.199
draw a basic conclusion like

4382.08 --> 4388.32
no this could never be possible

4385.199 --> 4391.28
or this could be a setup or

4388.32 --> 4393.5199999999995
hey that might actually be possible

4391.28 --> 4393.5199999999995
right

4394.64 --> 4399.52
that it's called critical

4397.76 --> 4400.8
cross-referencing with everything you've

4399.52 --> 4406.320000000001
learned

4400.8 --> 4406.320000000001
it should be plenty in this information

4410.84 --> 4413.84
age

4418.239 --> 4422.32
yeah dr kansa keep chanting for me keep

4421.36 --> 4424.96
chanting

4422.32 --> 4426.48
we're still breathing but we went to

4424.96 --> 4429.52
mars anyway even though that's

4426.48 --> 4431.28
physically impossible

4429.52 --> 4432.96
because you can't travel through a

4431.28 --> 4436.5599999999995
vacuum

4432.96 --> 4436.56
and still breathe here on earth

4438.32 --> 4443.04
that's right critical thinking good

4439.92 --> 4447.76
point you can't send something up there

4443.04 --> 4450.0
into a vacuum an endless vacuum mind you

4447.76 --> 4451.679
to another body of which you have no

4450.0 --> 4455.12
proof is a physical body it's just a

4451.679 --> 4457.52
light in the sky

4455.12 --> 4458.64
none of that could all be simultaneously

4457.52 --> 4461.84
real and you

4458.64 --> 4461.84
here on earth breathing

4463.36 --> 4471.04
it's physically impossible physically

4467.44 --> 4473.839999999999
not psychically you know psychologically

4471.04 --> 4475.84
everything is possible

4473.84 --> 4477.360000000001
subjectively in your mind and anything

4475.84 --> 4479.360000000001
could be possible if you

4477.36 --> 4480.96
allow it to believe if you allow

4479.36 --> 4485.28
yourself to believe it

4480.96 --> 4485.28
but physically it's not possible

4485.36 --> 4489.679
it's not an endless vacuum though yeah

4486.96 --> 4490.0
but it is vacuous enough and especially

4489.679 --> 4493.1990000000005
the

4490.0 --> 4495.28
sheer volume the endless volume and that

4493.199 --> 4499.199
lower pressure combined with earth

4495.28 --> 4502.08
being an open system would cause all

4499.199 --> 4503.678999999999
that air we're breathing right here to

4502.08 --> 4506.5599999999995
evacuate

4503.679 --> 4507.12
that may not be to a perfect vacuum

4506.56 --> 4509.84
level

4507.12 --> 4511.5199999999995
but it would certainly be damn well low

4509.84 --> 4513.28
enough that none of us could breathe

4511.52 --> 4516.080000000001
anymore

4513.28 --> 4517.599999999999
yeah doesn't matter whether it is a

4516.08 --> 4520.64
perfect vacuum

4517.6 --> 4525.04
or not what matters is that it's an

4520.64 --> 4528.2390000000005
endless volume versus an open system of

4525.04 --> 4530.8
earth the gas would spread out

4528.239 --> 4532.32
endlessly and then potentially form a

4530.8 --> 4534.0
gradient if it could ever reach an

4532.32 --> 4534.88
equilibrium with a container which it

4534.0 --> 4536.88
can't because the

4534.88 --> 4538.400000000001
containers said to have an endless

4536.88 --> 4540.8
volume

4538.4 --> 4542.239
right so it doesn't matter if it's

4540.8 --> 4545.04
slightly

4542.239 --> 4546.48
less low than what you conceive is a

4545.04 --> 4549.84
vacuum

4546.48 --> 4551.44
it's low enough and the volume is said

4549.84 --> 4554.8
to be endless

4551.44 --> 4555.44
yeah that means gas pressure would

4554.8 --> 4558.08
expand

4555.44 --> 4560.239
in that volume form a gradient with

4558.08 --> 4563.679
whatever

4560.239 --> 4564.159
is left spread out right that gradient

4563.679 --> 4567.1990000000005
would not

4564.159 --> 4570.639999999999
end up with this level of pressure here

4567.199 --> 4570.639999999999
on earth so that we could breathe

4571.679 --> 4575.28
yeah true miracle we are still alive

4573.679 --> 4576.08
that's right you know what that true

4575.28 --> 4578.08
miracle is

4576.08 --> 4580.8
the true miracle is that you freaking

4578.08 --> 4582.96
believe the heliocentric model

4580.8 --> 4584.56
and despite all logical consequences

4582.96 --> 4586.4
still believe

4584.56 --> 4589.360000000001
that we're in an open system yet

4586.4 --> 4592.639999999999
breathing versus outer space

4589.36 --> 4595.04
that's the miracle what's the container

4592.64 --> 4597.6
the container is the thing that is

4595.04 --> 4601.5199999999995
containing the gas pressure

4597.6 --> 4603.84
yeah it's what limits the volume

4601.52 --> 4606.2390000000005
for the gas pressure to expand into and

4603.84 --> 4609.6
then secondarily form a gradient

4606.239 --> 4610.879999999999
that's the container dr gonzo

4609.6 --> 4612.8
providing with the better model where

4610.88 --> 4613.4400000000005
you can stick your [ __ ] model up your

4612.8 --> 4616.4800000000005
ass

4613.44 --> 4617.5199999999995
[ __ ] but you just listen to natural

4616.48 --> 4621.599999999999
consequences

4617.52 --> 4624.080000000001
[ __ ] dr gunzo [ __ ]

4621.6 --> 4624.8
yeah model stick the [ __ ] model up

4624.08 --> 4626.5599999999995
your ass

4624.8 --> 4630.08
why don't you deal with physical reality

4626.56 --> 4630.080000000001
for a second yeah

4630.239 --> 4636.48
you're breathing which means

4633.36 --> 4638.159
the gas pressure is contained earth as

4636.48 --> 4641.919999999999
an open system versus an

4638.159 --> 4644.4
endless outer space vacuum volume

4641.92 --> 4646.4
that's not going to happen that can't

4644.4 --> 4648.4
happen gas pressure will expand in all

4646.4 --> 4651.36
directions to fill that volume

4648.4 --> 4652.08
and will leave us with very little gas

4651.36 --> 4653.839999999999
to breathe

4652.08 --> 4655.36
none at all actually because the volume

4653.84 --> 4658.08
is endless right

4655.36 --> 4659.92
endless volume that means the gas could

4658.08 --> 4661.84
never find an equilibrium within the

4659.92 --> 4663.36
container because the container has an

4661.84 --> 4664.96
endless volume

4663.36 --> 4666.799999999999
which means it's never going to settle

4664.96 --> 4669.52
to some kind of gradient which means

4666.8 --> 4672.56
we're never going to be breathing

4669.52 --> 4674.8
yeah yeah i

4672.56 --> 4676.64
am showing my true colors here i'm

4674.8 --> 4678.0
getting a little impatient with people

4676.64 --> 4681.4400000000005
doubling down

4678.0 --> 4681.44
to the worst degree

4683.92 --> 4687.28
what's the harsh tone all of a sudden

4685.52 --> 4690.88
well you just literally

4687.28 --> 4692.639999999999
ignored the entire setup and just said

4690.88 --> 4694.8
oh it's a miracle

4692.64 --> 4696.400000000001
it's a miracle we're breathing yeah in

4694.8 --> 4699.76
your freaking

4696.4 --> 4701.12
model which is broken as [ __ ] yeah it is

4699.76 --> 4702.56
a miracle

4701.12 --> 4704.96
you know what the miracle is the

4702.56 --> 4706.56
miracles that you still believe it

4704.96 --> 4709.04
because everything about it is

4706.56 --> 4711.4400000000005
physically impossible

4709.04 --> 4712.239
everything about it is physically

4711.44 --> 4715.599999999999
impossible

4712.239 --> 4716.0
yet you miraculously still believe it's

4715.6 --> 4718.88
true

4716.0 --> 4721.52
because you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] dr gonzo

4718.88 --> 4726.88
and i'm sick of it

4721.52 --> 4730.0
you don't need no [ __ ] photos to know

4726.88 --> 4735.84
that your model idea of the universe

4730.0 --> 4735.84
is not real because you're breathing

4743.75 --> 4746.81
[Music]

4750.81 --> 4754.319
[Music]

4755.04 --> 4759.84
george sanford it doesn't matter whether

4757.28 --> 4762.96
gravity is a force or not

4759.84 --> 4767.12
there is no force sufficient

4762.96 --> 4770.8
to keep gas pressure stuck to a ball

4767.12 --> 4773.44
versus an endless volume container

4770.8 --> 4775.04
there is no force you know why because

4773.44 --> 4777.44
the amount of force

4775.04 --> 4780.719
with which gas pressure expands within

4777.44 --> 4784.799999999999
the available volume of the container

4780.719 --> 4786.64
is as strong as the available volume of

4784.8 --> 4790.4800000000005
the container

4786.64 --> 4791.6
right so in order for gas to stick to a

4790.48 --> 4794.799999999999
ball

4791.6 --> 4796.96
thanks to a force versus a volume

4794.8 --> 4799.4400000000005
of a an endless amount of volume of a

4796.96 --> 4803.44
container that it all resides in

4799.44 --> 4805.599999999999
the force that that gas would have to be

4803.44 --> 4808.719
subjected to in order to keep it

4805.6 --> 4809.679
on the ball versus the endless volume

4808.719 --> 4813.12
out there

4809.679 --> 4816.0
would have to be infinite

4813.12 --> 4816.32
you understand infinite volume you want

4816.0 --> 4819.199
gas

4816.32 --> 4819.5199999999995
to stick to a ball in an infinite volume

4819.199 --> 4823.28
well

4819.52 --> 4827.4400000000005
then you require an infinite force

4823.28 --> 4831.599999999999
yeah you get it infinite force infinite

4827.44 --> 4832.5599999999995
power this gravity that you imagine is a

4831.6 --> 4835.1990000000005
force

4832.56 --> 4837.360000000001
would have to be so strong it would have

4835.199 --> 4841.839999999999
effectively have to be

4837.36 --> 4845.12
as strong as a black hole or actually

4841.84 --> 4848.4800000000005
endless amount stronger like a black

4845.12 --> 4852.4
hole is not strong

4848.48 --> 4855.44
enough to keep gas pressure sticking

4852.4 --> 4858.879999999999
to any vicinity about it versus

4855.44 --> 4860.32
the outer space volume yeah because the

4858.88 --> 4863.28
volume is

4860.32 --> 4863.679
infinite no force can keep it there

4863.28 --> 4866.239
because

4863.679 --> 4868.2390000000005
no force in the physical universe even

4866.239 --> 4872.5599999999995
theoretically according to your model

4868.239 --> 4875.2699999999995
no force is infinite you get it

4872.56 --> 4880.29
you get it you dumbass

4875.27 --> 4880.290000000001
[Music]

4880.4 --> 4883.759999999999
so even if you think that gravity was a

4883.04 --> 4886.48
force

4883.76 --> 4888.0
it can never be strong enough to keep

4886.48 --> 4891.839999999999
the gas pressure

4888.0 --> 4894.639
on the ball versus the infinite volume

4891.84 --> 4896.32
it would have to counter the force off

4894.639 --> 4903.84
of the gas pressure expansion

4896.32 --> 4903.84
you get it yet

4904.159 --> 4908.239
get the [ __ ] out of here i'm done with

4906.08 --> 4908.239
you

4909.44 --> 4917.839999999999
[ __ ] off

4928.4 --> 4932.96
so you're next on the table andy franson

4931.12 --> 4934.239
you want to say something stupid and get

4932.96 --> 4937.199
banned too

4934.239 --> 4937.199
you want to get out of here

4938.159 --> 4941.199
because you all just need to learn to

4940.719 --> 4944.32
shut

4941.199 --> 4948.0
the [ __ ] up whenever you're

4944.32 --> 4951.759999999999
wrong and stop asserting your god

4948.0 --> 4954.4
damn religious [ __ ] beliefs

4951.76 --> 4955.12
about how things can happen when they

4954.4 --> 4958.5599999999995
can't

4955.12 --> 4961.599999999999
according to physics you need to stop

4958.56 --> 4963.84
blurting out your religious puke

4961.6 --> 4965.1990000000005
every time that happens just need to

4963.84 --> 4968.88
learn to shut

4965.199 --> 4968.879999999999
the [ __ ] up

4968.96 --> 4973.84
stop being a goddamn [ __ ]

4974.0 --> 4979.84
if it can't work that means it can't

4977.52 --> 4979.84
work

4980.96 --> 4987.84
get real

4992.0 --> 4998.4
[Music]

4994.239 --> 5002.08
it is the greatest honor conceivable

4998.4 --> 5005.36
is the greatest honor conceivable

5002.08 --> 5008.719
to recognize when you're wrong

5005.36 --> 5011.92
and then correct it correct

5008.719 --> 5015.84
it utilizing

5011.92 --> 5015.84
the new information

5016.04 --> 5019.44
cross-referencing it with everything

5018.96 --> 5022.4800000000005
you've

5019.44 --> 5024.239
ever learned

5022.48 --> 5026.959999999999
yeah it's called correcting yourself

5024.239 --> 5029.04
it's the greatest honor possible

5026.96 --> 5030.159
for a person especially if they know a

5029.04 --> 5033.36
lot

5030.159 --> 5036.159
to correct themselves

5033.36 --> 5037.04
when they have figured out thanks to

5036.159 --> 5039.12
themselves

5037.04 --> 5040.84
or somebody else pointing it out that

5039.12 --> 5043.92
they're wrong

5040.84 --> 5045.28
yeah so why don't you take some of that

5043.92 --> 5047.6
why don't you just concede you're

5045.28 --> 5050.48
freaking wrong about your globe

5047.6 --> 5052.4800000000005
it can't be i gave you a very elaborate

5050.48 --> 5055.12
explanation

5052.48 --> 5056.08
why you can't be breathing in your model

5055.12 --> 5058.639
it's impossible

5056.08 --> 5059.84
it doesn't matter how you see things

5058.639 --> 5063.04
every level on

5059.84 --> 5064.88
every conceivable level presuppositional

5063.04 --> 5065.5199999999995
deep presuppositional that it's all

5064.88 --> 5068.400000000001
possible

5065.52 --> 5070.639
in the way you think it is then it still

5068.4 --> 5074.239
doesn't work nothing

5070.639 --> 5078.159000000001
about the globe model works not a single

5074.239 --> 5078.638999999999
[ __ ] thing nothing nothing about it

5078.159 --> 5081.92
works

5078.639 --> 5085.04
it's the most broken model

5081.92 --> 5086.56
humanity has ever conceived don't you

5085.04 --> 5089.28
freaking get it yet

5086.56 --> 5090.8
everything about it is wrong on every

5089.28 --> 5094.48
corner

5090.8 --> 5097.360000000001
every corner diving into it

5094.48 --> 5098.5599999999995
it's wrong believing it within it you'll

5097.36 --> 5101.199
find mistakes

5098.56 --> 5103.8
not believing it you'll see exactly how

5101.199 --> 5107.28
bad it is

5103.8 --> 5110.4800000000005
everything about the heliocentric model

5107.28 --> 5114.639
is wrong every god damn

5110.48 --> 5116.879999999999
thing about it is wrong everything

5114.639 --> 5117.84
there's not a single [ __ ] thing in

5116.88 --> 5120.88
the entire

5117.84 --> 5122.56
setup that is correct everything is

5120.88 --> 5124.2390000000005
wrong everything is based on false

5122.56 --> 5127.52
assumption everything is based

5124.239 --> 5130.32
on false presuppositions every god damn

5127.52 --> 5130.320000000001
thing about it

5130.8 --> 5134.159000000001
and i'll give a [ __ ] who disagrees with

5133.52 --> 5137.4400000000005
me

5134.159 --> 5141.04
it's wrong it's provably wrong

5137.44 --> 5143.44
provably wrong every freaking

5141.04 --> 5145.12
step of the way and if you don't think

5143.44 --> 5155.759999999999
so you're a goddamn

5145.12 --> 5157.76
religious zealot [ __ ]

5155.76 --> 5169.84
[Music]

5157.76 --> 5169.84
be right back in two minutes

5265.28 --> 5269.36
yeah guns have never owned r p good see

5268.48 --> 5272.718999999999
you

5269.36 --> 5275.12
well it's worse though it's is worse

5272.719 --> 5276.88
than just the whole cosmological and

5275.12 --> 5279.5199999999995
heliocentric systems are based on

5276.88 --> 5284.8
unbelievable math formulas and equations

5279.52 --> 5288.4800000000005
yeah it's worse

5284.8 --> 5292.0
even the freaking math formulas

5288.48 --> 5293.199
and equations are broken within their

5292.0 --> 5297.12
fields

5293.199 --> 5299.759999999999
respectively yeah they can't even get

5297.12 --> 5303.36
the gravity correct

5299.76 --> 5303.679
for mercury in our solar system which is

5303.36 --> 5306.239
like

5303.679 --> 5308.4800000000005
really supposedly close by in order for

5306.239 --> 5309.199
us to see it visual and moving around

5308.48 --> 5312.32
and all that

5309.199 --> 5316.48
yeah so even in

5312.32 --> 5319.759999999999
their math even there it's broken

5316.48 --> 5323.12
every conceivable aspect

5319.76 --> 5326.0
of the heliocentric model is broken

5323.12 --> 5326.8
the only place it could ever possibly

5326.0 --> 5329.76
work

5326.8 --> 5331.679
is in the imagination of people because

5329.76 --> 5336.96
they wouldn't look too deep into it

5331.679 --> 5340.96
yeah visualizing it yeah that works out

5336.96 --> 5342.719
proving it absolutely impossible

5340.96 --> 5345.6
everything about it is broken there's

5342.719 --> 5349.199
not one thing about it that is complete

5345.6 --> 5349.1990000000005
everything is broken

5349.76 --> 5352.8
everything about it it's the most broken

5352.159 --> 5365.839999999999
model

5352.8 --> 5365.84
humanity has ever conceived

5376.84 --> 5379.84
so

5381.44 --> 5387.199
right human progression

5387.679 --> 5393.4400000000005
human progression yeah if anything the

5389.84 --> 5396.719
whole thing is a giant human regression

5393.44 --> 5398.719
it's like this giant debt like national

5396.719 --> 5400.159
debt building up and then saying oh look

5398.719 --> 5402.56
at how much that we have

5400.159 --> 5403.759999999999
is so much activity so much yeah it's

5402.56 --> 5407.1990000000005
all debt

5403.76 --> 5410.96
it's all that

5407.199 --> 5414.239
all negative it's all [ __ ] all wrong

5410.96 --> 5418.88
everything about it is wrong yet you you

5414.239 --> 5420.959999999999
pridefully display it in your stupidity

5418.88 --> 5424.2390000000005
like it is a positive because you're

5420.96 --> 5426.88
living in a reversed world

5424.239 --> 5428.239
you're living with your mind with your

5426.88 --> 5430.08
spirit in a world

5428.239 --> 5432.0
where you think something that is

5430.08 --> 5434.32
absolutely impossible in every

5432.0 --> 5436.96
conceivable mechanical way

5434.32 --> 5437.679
you believe that that is the reality and

5436.96 --> 5439.84
any

5437.679 --> 5440.8
anything common sense pointing out that

5439.84 --> 5443.360000000001
it isn't

5440.8 --> 5448.2390000000005
that's the wrong thing yeah you're

5443.36 --> 5450.08
living in the reversed world here

5448.239 --> 5452.718999999999
so it makes sense that everything is

5450.08 --> 5453.6
switched around 180 degrees logically to

5452.719 --> 5456.639
you

5453.6 --> 5457.679
logic is not logic illogical things are

5456.639 --> 5463.84
logical

5457.679 --> 5463.84
according to to you

5468.33 --> 5471.43
[Music]

5474.48 --> 5482.08
i don't give a [ __ ] i might unblock him

5477.92 --> 5486.8
later i was just really sick of dr gonzo

5482.08 --> 5486.8
you know just keep on blurting [ __ ]

5489.76 --> 5493.52
you know tiny wumble at least at times

5493.199 --> 5497.199
will

5493.52 --> 5499.120000000001
simply admit the flaws

5497.199 --> 5501.5199999999995
you know it's very important if you're a

5499.12 --> 5504.48
baller you need

5501.52 --> 5505.92
you need some recognition for the flaws

5504.48 --> 5510.5599999999995
right

5505.92 --> 5514.159
that there is flaws and that that's bad

5510.56 --> 5517.04
right some humility

5514.159 --> 5519.839999999999
just just a little is okay and dr gonzo

5517.04 --> 5519.84
didn't have any

5525.28 --> 5533.84
what's that george sanford

5534.719 --> 5539.28
oh why you should not trust today's

5537.76 --> 5544.8
cosmology

5539.28 --> 5544.8
huh that's your video

5544.84 --> 5548.0
cool

5546.639 --> 5551.92
i didn't know you even ever had a

5548.0 --> 5551.92

5553.76 --> 5557.52
thanks for the link that's a good link

5556.96 --> 5560.2390000000005
too

5557.52 --> 5561.84
yeah i guess people in chat subscribe to

5560.239 --> 5564.718999999999
george sanford i didn't even know he had

5561.84 --> 5564.719
an active channel

5567.84 --> 5571.28
it's almost 50 subscribers so subscribe

5570.32 --> 5572.88
to him now

5571.28 --> 5575.84
he's a pretty cool guy he's been around

5572.88 --> 5575.84
for a while

5600.84 --> 5605.97
do

5602.83 --> 5605.97
[Music]

5607.679 --> 5611.12
okay now i'm not even knowing whether

5614.84 --> 5617.84
i'm

5624.56 --> 5631.84
they're gonna miss him though i already

5627.76 --> 5631.84
told you i'm gonna unblock him probably

5631.97 --> 5635.029
[Music]

5640.8 --> 5645.84
i just had no i could have just timed

5643.12 --> 5645.84
him out

5646.08 --> 5650.8
yeah next time i'll not i was just kind

5648.8 --> 5651.52
of building up in my momentum and then

5650.8 --> 5654.639
if somebody

5651.52 --> 5659.84
just still stops doing the same [ __ ] i

5654.639 --> 5659.84
can get a little pissed off

5678.719 --> 5684.84
ah george sanford has 50 subscribers now

5681.96 --> 5687.84

5684.84 --> 5687.84
cool

5698.84 --> 5701.84
ah

5712.84 --> 5715.84
um

5726.84 --> 5729.84
so

5740.84 --> 5745.76
hmm

5743.84 --> 5747.28
you don't want subs well don't worry i'm

5745.76 --> 5749.4400000000005
not gonna have a

5747.28 --> 5751.84
marathon for you but if you're gonna

5749.44 --> 5753.36
have some interesting clips

5751.84 --> 5755.1990000000005
then at least it'll be worth it it's

5753.36 --> 5757.44
just like tara 306

5755.199 --> 5760.159
he's not right here or he's not here

5757.44 --> 5762.879999999999
right now i think

5760.159 --> 5764.159
d2 makes like videos like that although

5762.88 --> 5767.92
i think he's got a

5764.159 --> 5770.719
uh he had a strike last time because he

5767.92 --> 5773.4400000000005
uploaded a video with copyrighted

5770.719 --> 5785.84
material i think

5773.44 --> 5785.839999999999
so be careful with that

5807.199 --> 5811.119
what question tiny wumbo are you going

5809.679 --> 5812.88
to ask a question

5811.119 --> 5814.88
i scrolled back you didn't ask any

5812.88 --> 5817.6
question so

5814.88 --> 5827.84
why don't you ask me if you can ask your

5817.6 --> 5827.84
question and just ask your question

5852.84 --> 5856.2390000000005
hmm

5854.0 --> 5856.239
uh

5866.84 --> 5869.84
really

5872.56 --> 5883.84
are you sure i don't know what a qtf

5876.08 --> 5883.84
exactly is by the way

5906.8 --> 5914.320000000001
the linear distance from tropic of

5911.04 --> 5918.56
what linear distance what distance

5914.32 --> 5922.84
distance you say to two stars

5918.56 --> 5924.88
how did you get to that distance how did

5922.84 --> 5939.84
you measure that

5924.88 --> 5939.84
distance tiny mumble

5964.56 --> 5969.6
yeah up having i've been quite ranting

5967.679 --> 5972.56
uh i got a little pissed off with dr

5969.6 --> 5972.56
gonzo earlier

5972.639 --> 5980.639
i shouldn't call people goddamn retards

5975.199 --> 5982.159
even when i'm really pissed off

5980.639 --> 5985.76
or at least they didn't say anything

5982.159 --> 5985.759999999999
worse than that it's just that

5986.4 --> 5990.4
i don't know man i don't know how else

5988.32 --> 5991.679
to express myself when i get really

5990.4 --> 5994.239
pissed off

5991.679 --> 5997.119
at somebody for being stupid it just

5994.239 --> 5997.119
makes me wanna like

5997.52 --> 6002.2390000000005
stop trying to fool yourself

6003.92 --> 6011.92
but we're dealing with ballers

6008.239 --> 6014.718999999999
so yeah if i'm at the helm acting

6011.92 --> 6016.719
communicating i will keep my patience

6014.719 --> 6019.44
for a very long time i think i did

6016.719 --> 6021.679
right i did pretty much keep very calm

6019.44 --> 6025.759999999999
composure for at least the first

6021.679 --> 6027.36
hour and 15 minutes but after a while

6025.76 --> 6029.119000000001
when they keep on doubling down the

6027.36 --> 6030.96
cognitive dissonance responses

6029.119 --> 6032.96
eventually it just starts to get

6030.96 --> 6035.52
annoying and then eventually i get

6032.96 --> 6038.96
pissed off

6035.52 --> 6042.320000000001
right started out with a lot of patience

6038.96 --> 6045.119
but eventually it does run out

6042.32 --> 6047.119
and hey having a live show for two hours

6045.119 --> 6051.5199999999995
with ballers constantly there it's

6047.119 --> 6054.159
it's yeah it's a lot of time

6051.52 --> 6054.159000000001
to lose your

6063.199 --> 6067.36
i'm not patience about stars that's not

6065.28 --> 6070.159
the tropic of cancer

6067.36 --> 6071.679
oh really so what is the tropic what is

6070.159 --> 6076.4
the tropic of cancer

6071.679 --> 6076.4
isn't that a constellation of stars

6076.84 --> 6079.84
right

6079.92 --> 6088.639
so stars right a group of stars

6084.88 --> 6093.84
so you say it there is a distance to it

6088.639 --> 6093.84
do you tiny momo

6100.159 --> 6107.36
no okay no

6104.8 --> 6110.0
you you just accidentally set there was

6107.36 --> 6110.0
a distance

6110.48 --> 6114.32
right because there is no distance it's

6113.04 --> 6116.0
just lights

6114.32 --> 6120.0
there's no proof that there's any

6116.0 --> 6123.119
location to any of the lights

6120.0 --> 6124.32
just an apparition nothing to do with

6123.119 --> 6127.679
stars oh really so

6124.32 --> 6131.36
what are those terminologies then like

6127.679 --> 6134.96
tropic of cancer and capricorn

6131.36 --> 6135.44
explain to me what that is what is that

6134.96 --> 6138.4800000000005
then

6135.44 --> 6141.04
right what when you look up the tropic

6138.48 --> 6149.839999999999
of cancer or capricorn

6141.04 --> 6149.84
what does it say it is

6166.48 --> 6170.5599999999995
tropic is not a group of stars okay so

6169.28 --> 6173.92
what what is it then

6170.56 --> 6177.84
indifference you tell me you tell me

6173.92 --> 6177.84
what is it

6193.36 --> 6205.199
care king that's

6196.719 --> 6209.04
not english

6205.199 --> 6209.04
what what are you talking about voynich

6213.72 --> 6216.93
[Music]

6217.76 --> 6220.159000000001
hello

6229.76 --> 6234.88
dude what the guns have never wrote what

6232.48 --> 6238.0599999999995
are you doing

6234.88 --> 6238.06
[Music]

6245.36 --> 6247.839999999999
right so

6248.96 --> 6255.92
he said it's

6252.56 --> 6257.52
the northern or southern orbit of the

6255.92 --> 6259.679
sun

6257.52 --> 6261.280000000001
yeah i thought you were mistaken there

6259.679 --> 6262.719
even though he does deserve it but i'd

6261.28 --> 6264.239
like to keep him around

6262.719 --> 6265.92
it's no problem don't worry about it

6264.239 --> 6270.08
guns will never run

6265.92 --> 6273.76
so as the orbit

6270.08 --> 6277.28
of the sun so what is the sun according

6273.76 --> 6277.280000000001
to the heliocentric model

6278.239 --> 6281.28
isn't it a star

6282.32 --> 6288.799999999999
so a distance

6285.36 --> 6292.48
to it would be a distance to the star so

6288.8 --> 6293.679
how exactly was i wrong several people

6292.48 --> 6295.36
in my channel say yo

6293.679 --> 6297.04
let's know something else and start

6295.36 --> 6298.799999999999
talking in dutch and

6297.04 --> 6301.199
well i'm pretty sure there's it's still

6298.8 --> 6302.96
a distance to a star

6301.199 --> 6304.879999999999
even though it's not apparently about

6302.96 --> 6307.119
the constellation out there it is about

6304.88 --> 6317.84
the pathway of the sun

6307.119 --> 6317.839999999999
it's a reference to that it seems

6319.92 --> 6323.36
don't know what tropics are okay oh let

6322.239 --> 6330.259999999999
me look it up then

6323.36 --> 6333.398999999999
if i don't know what tropics are

6330.26 --> 6333.399
[Music]

6334.56 --> 6340.4800000000005
right so the tropics is a region

6338.4 --> 6341.839999999999
right i knew that the tropical regions

6340.48 --> 6346.0
right

6341.84 --> 6359.84
but when you talk about the tropic

6346.0 --> 6359.84
of cancer what does that mean

6363.679 --> 6377.679
hold on

6373.6 --> 6380.320000000001
okay so i think i got the field wrong

6377.679 --> 6380.32
then i guess

6380.8 --> 6384.96
it's not about the constellation i think

6383.679 --> 6387.679
it is derived

6384.96 --> 6389.28
though from it that's why it uses those

6387.679 --> 6392.8
names

6389.28 --> 6395.5199999999995
because yeah i'm pretty sure that cancer

6392.8 --> 6397.04
refers to the constellation which is

6395.52 --> 6399.119000000001
called cancer

6397.04 --> 6402.159
so it is still indirectly involved but

6399.119 --> 6402.159
apparently it's a

6403.44 --> 6410.32
referred to as a line on the earth

6406.8 --> 6415.84
which angular wise relates

6410.32 --> 6415.84
to the constellations i guess

6421.44 --> 6428.48
right so it's a sort of a mercator line

6424.96 --> 6433.679
on the earth

6428.48 --> 6433.678999999999
that relates to the constellation

6438.96 --> 6443.84
did we get that misunderstanding out of

6440.8 --> 6443.84
the way now

6445.36 --> 6450.4
right so a distance a distance somewhere

6453.52 --> 6457.280000000001
so we're talking about the literal

6455.84 --> 6460.719
distance

6457.28 --> 6461.5199999999995
to a virtual line on the earth's surface

6460.719 --> 6465.36
then i guess

6461.52 --> 6465.360000000001
okay well that wouldn't be entirely

6468.84 --> 6471.84
impossible

6477.28 --> 6485.84
don't spam

6493.52 --> 6499.84
hey you had a making by the way

6502.159 --> 6507.5199999999995
all right oh my mistake i misinterpreted

6504.56 --> 6509.76
i thought you were talking about

6507.52 --> 6511.76
the constellations out there i recognize

6509.76 --> 6513.92
the word but apparently if you say

6511.76 --> 6516.8
atropic

6513.92 --> 6517.28
a tropic is apparently very specific to

6516.8 --> 6520.88
a

6517.28 --> 6523.04
line on the earth that relates

6520.88 --> 6524.96
to the angular positions of the heavenly

6523.04 --> 6528.32
bodies i guess

6524.96 --> 6530.2390000000005
so i got it wrong see see i got it wrong

6528.32 --> 6533.28
i made a mistake

6530.239 --> 6533.28
and i corrected it

6533.36 --> 6541.839999999999
yeah it's the greatest honor to correct

6535.84 --> 6541.84
a mistake

6542.96 --> 6546.96
although i don't think that the mistake

6545.28 --> 6550.0
that i made is really that

6546.96 --> 6552.88
unbelievable since english is not my

6550.0 --> 6552.88
first language

6553.599 --> 6557.599
and i didn't i wasn't aware that this

6555.599 --> 6560.8
was a thing

6557.599 --> 6562.56
like a technical thing

6560.8 --> 6564.639
i must have missed it because i'm pretty

6562.56 --> 6566.56
sure that people like adam and all that

6564.639 --> 6568.56
has been talking about that over the

6566.56 --> 6571.119000000001
debates in the last

6568.56 --> 6573.599
three years and apparently i didn't

6571.119 --> 6576.88
catch on to that that

6573.599 --> 6577.84
what that actually meant because it

6576.88 --> 6580.719
happened sometimes

6577.84 --> 6582.639
yeah people talk about things and i

6580.719 --> 6584.32
don't necessarily understand what it

6582.639 --> 6588.4800000000005
means

6584.32 --> 6591.28
but i i get an interpretation

6588.48 --> 6592.638999999999
and that interpretation might just fit

6591.28 --> 6595.92
well enough

6592.639 --> 6597.92
within the mash of the explanation to me

6595.92 --> 6600.4
so then i'll never inquire because i

6597.92 --> 6602.719
thought i got it right

6600.4 --> 6604.638999999999
but now it turns out that i had a

6602.719 --> 6607.04
mistake

6604.639 --> 6608.4800000000005
in there i didn't know that a tropic was

6607.04 --> 6612.4
actually a

6608.48 --> 6614.159
a derived line location line on earth i

6612.4 --> 6625.839999999999
didn't know that

6614.159 --> 6625.839999999999
good to know that

6629.47 --> 6632.659000000001
[Music]

6641.92 --> 6645.84
yeah dude finish i've never even heard

6644.56 --> 6649.679
of that word

6645.84 --> 6650.159000000001
in dutch get it i've never heard of that

6649.679 --> 6652.8
word

6650.159 --> 6654.879999999999
ever in dutch never heard of it never

6652.8 --> 6658.639
heard anybody say that word

6654.88 --> 6667.84
voynich so yeah you can keep saying that

6658.639 --> 6667.84
i've never heard it before

6670.719 --> 6673.76
just never brought up

6678.88 --> 6682.159000000001
with me it's always about regions and

6681.199 --> 6685.36
all that

6682.159 --> 6686.08
tropic the tropical region well that's

6685.36 --> 6689.839999999999
the only

6686.08 --> 6692.4
way that i knew about the tropic

6689.84 --> 6693.1990000000005
the utilization of the work tropic even

6692.4 --> 6695.839999999999
right

6693.199 --> 6695.839999999999
that's it

6696.48 --> 6701.44
then again i've never been like a master

6698.96 --> 6704.0
geologist

6701.44 --> 6704.799999999999
never assimilated every single aspect of

6704.0 --> 6706.639
it because

6704.8 --> 6708.159000000001
it wasn't all that interesting it was

6706.639 --> 6710.4800000000005
much more interested in what was

6708.159 --> 6712.48
happening outside of the earth in outer

6710.48 --> 6723.839999999999
space yeah yeah

6712.48 --> 6723.839999999999
how ironic in retrospect

6727.199 --> 6731.199
no george sanford that's not spelled

6734.84 --> 6737.84
wrong

6738.159 --> 6741.92
if we need to just put it down in a

6740.639 --> 6746.4800000000005
singular form you

6741.92 --> 6746.4800000000005
you put it down in multiple form

6747.92 --> 6751.84
there's another word for that in english

6758.88 --> 6765.04
when it comes to spelling terminologies

6762.639 --> 6768.0
i know a lot more spelling terminologies

6765.04 --> 6770.48
in dutch than i do in english

6768.0 --> 6772.48
that's kind of weird isn't it i know how

6770.48 --> 6775.919999999999
to say the terminologies

6772.48 --> 6779.28
involving spelling in dutch

6775.92 --> 6783.679
i don't really know them all that well

6779.28 --> 6783.679
in english right plural that's it

6784.32 --> 6790.0
yeah just i never got i never

6787.679 --> 6790.8
learned it that hard i learned it i

6790.0 --> 6794.32
really had to

6790.8 --> 6795.52
ram it through with dutch really hard

6794.32 --> 6798.08
because i was hard

6795.52 --> 6800.320000000001
learn it with language i was really hard

6798.08 --> 6804.32
learning when i was younger

6800.32 --> 6804.32
i didn't get it it wouldn't fit

6805.28 --> 6813.599
but i guess through heavy heavy training

6809.84 --> 6815.679
i've become a lot better at it at least

6813.599 --> 6817.92
but it didn't have a lot of room in my

6815.679 --> 6819.679
mind for it when i was younger

6817.92 --> 6822.4
i was just waiting for telepathy to

6819.679 --> 6822.4
become a thing

6825.92 --> 6829.4400000000005
anyway i'm rounding out the show so

6827.84 --> 6831.679
