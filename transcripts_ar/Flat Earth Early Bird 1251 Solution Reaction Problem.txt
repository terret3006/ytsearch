Trails but

144.18 --> 148.4
not too much or it's blowing away

148.62 --> 153.42000000000002
seems so maybe there's a lot of wind

150.54 --> 155.34
high up because it seems so very spread

153.42 --> 159.07999999999998
apart

155.34 --> 159.08
what originally was a trail

159.959 --> 164.7
but yeah other than that it's actually

162.18 --> 168.54000000000002
kind of weird still not entirely still

164.7 --> 169.98
but there's just not very big gusts

168.54 --> 172.5
of it

169.98 --> 175.5
and it's really nice and sunny and warm

172.5 --> 179.159
not a lot of clouds couple

175.5 --> 182.239

179.159 --> 182.239
check temperature

183.599 --> 190.67999999999998

206.76 --> 211.2
territorial

208.56 --> 214.5
jackdaws are building a new nest in the

211.2 --> 217.33999999999997

279.54 --> 285.66
okay you've been snooping okay fine I

282.6 --> 287.34000000000003
don't really care who it was right they

285.66 --> 289.86
were both in on it and Sean is

287.34 --> 292.02
constantly just blabbering his mouth off

289.86 --> 295.38
yeah I did it and then no it wasn't me

292.02 --> 298.75899999999996
but I did it but it wasn't me it's just

295.38 --> 298.759
just ugh

301.62 --> 307.139
okay you don't have to retract that

303.479 --> 309.84
message Matthew Hall it's all fine

307.139 --> 312.36
I'm just like I don't really care that

309.84 --> 315.479
much like who's done that like they're

312.36 --> 317.52000000000004
both seem they both seem to be in on it

315.479 --> 319.86
and even if you're just gonna take the

317.52 --> 322.039
credit for it whether that's a lie or

319.86 --> 322.039
not

323.039 --> 328.21999999999997
yeah I will basically take care of you

329.9 --> 335.82

[Music]

335.82 --> 341.88

339.479 --> 344.94
couldn't remember your password oh yeah

341.88 --> 347.58
sorry about that

344.94 --> 349.68
you could still just view my stream at

347.58 --> 352.56
least

349.68 --> 354.90000000000003
oh by the way I also figured out

352.56 --> 357.9
I kind of overlooked it how to download

354.9 --> 360.06
it so I did actually download like the

357.9 --> 364.02
last four streams

360.06 --> 365.88
the ones before that I lost but yeah I

364.02 --> 367.85999999999996
don't know I wasn't too remarkably good

365.88 --> 370.02
or anything

367.86 --> 371.759
but the last few streams like the last

370.02 --> 375.06
four streams on d-life have been very

371.759 --> 378.97900000000004
good and I intend to keep that

375.06 --> 378.979
frequency momentum going

382.5 --> 386.039
right

383.759 --> 390.72
now like

386.039 --> 393.9
avoid getting angry a bit more

390.72 --> 396.74

426.22 --> 429.66
[Music]

428.06 --> 431.88
foreign

429.66 --> 436.79900000000004
I think you can

431.88 --> 436.799
[Music]

449.819 --> 453.47900000000004
a bunch of running little children out

451.74 --> 456.3
there having fun

453.479 --> 458.639
going in the playground of course it is

456.3 --> 460.68
really popular it's a popular playground

458.639 --> 463.38
for the kids

460.68 --> 465.479
hopefully somewhere this summer

463.38 --> 467.4
my friend from Nightmare is Gonna Come

465.479 --> 469.139
Over

467.4 --> 471.0
we'll be talked over the phone and she

469.139 --> 472.979
said she would and like take her

471.0 --> 475.379
boyfriend with her and her kid and then

472.979 --> 477.539
like we go to the playground

475.379 --> 480.74
maybe have some lunch or something

477.539 --> 480.74
I'm looking forward to that

482.94 --> 486.199
hey seeking star water

503.099 --> 507.02
right so yeah a lot has happened

508.86 --> 511.759
out there

513.18 --> 520.019
I don't know if anybody saw

516.419 --> 523.14
ball busters I was there live I kind of

520.019 --> 525.899
was able to do a thing

523.14 --> 527.06
that was like in context of the

525.899 --> 529.019
presentation

527.06 --> 532.7399999999999
concerning time

529.019 --> 534.899
named as a supernatural thing

532.74 --> 537.1800000000001
and I basically made a little discussion

534.899 --> 539.82
out of it and yeah people went with that

537.18 --> 541.62
like and it was great it was a it was a

539.82 --> 543.9590000000001
good show overall

541.62 --> 546.3
yeah also a bit of a numpty did come in

543.959 --> 548.6999999999999
after that point

546.3 --> 551.04
and that did like radically change

548.7 --> 554.0400000000001
around the mood

551.04 --> 556.26
but eventually we overcame that as well

554.04 --> 559.38
and was a great show it was really good

556.26 --> 562.4399999999999
to be back on bobbusters

559.38 --> 566.12
ah you just finished it

562.44 --> 566.12
all right Canada what do you think

571.8 --> 577.3199999999999
I mean I even like in the Heat of the

573.899 --> 579.66
Moment just gave the guy a very fair

577.32 --> 581.399
moment to be able to reflect like yeah

579.66 --> 584.1
what are you doing here

581.399 --> 587.459
like not even with like a a negative

584.1 --> 589.6800000000001
like oh you're such an idiot

587.459 --> 591.05
just like hey hello what are you doing

589.68 --> 592.1999999999999
here you don't want to explain

591.05 --> 594.06
[Music]

592.2 --> 597.5
you don't want to admit you're in the

594.06 --> 597.5
discussion what are you doing here

598.68 --> 604.2199999999999
anyway

600.959 --> 604.2199999999999
I thought it was a good show

604.8 --> 612.42
[Music]

607.32 --> 614.9590000000001
yeah no yeah literally no argument not

612.42 --> 614.959
yeah

615.24 --> 621.9590000000001
and just like no I'm not gonna tell you

617.899 --> 625.2
uh okay well then we can't really have a

621.959 --> 628.3389999999999
good solid conversation now can we

625.2 --> 628.339
why are you here

629.579 --> 634.3199999999999
yeah he was just there to not get banned

631.8 --> 636.8389999999999
for chat skanking but my God so he was

634.32 --> 639.36
basically just

636.839 --> 641.7600000000001
a chat Scag

639.36 --> 644.22
I mean pretty brave for a chat skank to

641.76 --> 646.26
come on but he basically was just a chat

644.22 --> 648.779
skank and that's weird that he didn't

646.26 --> 651.0
like have any things that he was holding

648.779 --> 652.86
back as a chat Scag no he was actually

651.0 --> 655.92
just that didn't even want to have a

652.86 --> 658.14
conversation it's just nagging

655.92 --> 661.62
but brave enough to actually come on

658.14 --> 665.1
live apparently he really cares for his

661.62 --> 667.32
checked skanking rights enough to expose

665.1 --> 670.14
himself

667.32 --> 672.36
right that's really weird by the way

670.14 --> 674.42
when you think about that

672.36 --> 674.42
um

675.12 --> 678.839
because he wants to keep cats ganking

677.279 --> 682.42
right

678.839 --> 685.5300000000001
these people are weird man

682.42 --> 685.53
[Music]

687.18 --> 689.8389999999999
ah

692.22 --> 697.86
hello Randall Cochran

695.399 --> 699.0
a map from I've never heard of the heart

697.86 --> 701.88
map

699.0 --> 705.38
s multiple okay

701.88 --> 705.38
is that a new release or

711.66 --> 716.16
or did you just happen to come across it

714.18 --> 718.519
recently

716.16 --> 718.519
anyway

723.0 --> 728.1
how can that be your job how is Chad

726.06 --> 731.279
skanking a job I mean I'd like to see

728.1 --> 735.24
that job application somewhere

731.279 --> 738.06
I mean is chat skanking actually a job

735.24 --> 740.279
that is really weird

738.06 --> 742.579
even just the idea is really weird kind

740.279 --> 742.579
of bear

743.88 --> 750.1
anyway

746.13 --> 750.1
[Music]

752.22 --> 756.8000000000001
right so

754.68 --> 759.4799999999999
goody

756.8 --> 762.5
Bill's not banned maybe he's gonna pop

759.48 --> 762.5
in the chat as well

763.56 --> 768.7399999999999
oh God seeking star water really have to

766.38 --> 768.74
do that

769.92 --> 772.6999999999999
I have

774.42 --> 779.399
I've heard there's things there they're

776.399 --> 781.5
trying to Ram things through

779.399 --> 783.839
but I don't think they

781.5 --> 786.139
I think they're like overplaying their

783.839 --> 786.139
hand

787.38 --> 793.32
I think it's going to like become really

790.26 --> 796.079
illusory in a lot of ways it already was

793.32 --> 798.24
but I think that like in the face of

796.079 --> 800.76
failure they're not going to discontinue

798.24 --> 803.5790000000001
the rollout of the plan like they don't

800.76 --> 806.22
even have resistance but because they do

803.579 --> 809.16
have resistance against it and it's

806.22 --> 812.94
growing they're going to basically make

809.16 --> 814.92
a phantom operation out of parts of it

812.94 --> 816.3000000000001
and just displaying like yeah we're

814.92 --> 818.88
rolling it out oh look here's it's

816.3 --> 819.899
happening but actually nothing really is

818.88 --> 822.48
happening

819.899 --> 825.0
they're just waiting until they could do

822.48 --> 826.6800000000001
something but it's not working right I

825.0 --> 830.36
think there's going to be a lot of weird

826.68 --> 830.3599999999999
[ __ ] coming out

830.459 --> 835.1389999999999
like that and a very suggested like it's

833.1 --> 836.6990000000001
happening but actually nothing is

835.139 --> 841.019
happening but it's sort of like a Next

836.699 --> 843.42
Level crisis act integration it's no

841.019 --> 846.24
longer events it's just like the whole

843.42 --> 847.86
plan might become virtual

846.24 --> 849.0600000000001
because they're getting so much

847.86 --> 851.22
resistance

849.06 --> 855.6199999999999
just like that Village

851.22 --> 859.6800000000001
where they're having this this Gathering

855.62 --> 862.86
was it the Switzerland they basically

859.68 --> 866.04
build entire fake Villages like a movie

862.86 --> 868.0790000000001
set it's completely fake and that's very

866.04 --> 870.42
telling I've seen that sort of thing

868.079 --> 873.3599999999999
before that they do that but I think

870.42 --> 874.74
that it will be you know what it gave me

873.36 --> 878.399
the feeling of

874.74 --> 880.5
a real strong sensation

878.399 --> 882.66
remember how

880.5 --> 885.54
there used to be like things about North

882.66 --> 888.06
Korea that like journalists were sent

885.54 --> 890.639
and that they were basically LED on a

888.06 --> 893.66
path that just seemed like they were

890.639 --> 895.92
shown Carnival attractions like complete

893.66 --> 898.139
make-believe acting of like giant

895.92 --> 901.199
amounts of people and like fake places

898.139 --> 905.04
where people were happy and it was like

901.199 --> 906.06
completely fake just to uphold that

905.04 --> 908.76
picture

906.06 --> 912.0
right and that was meant for Outsiders

908.76 --> 915.42
but what if that's actually what is

912.0 --> 917.399
happening not for Outsiders but for the

915.42 --> 921.5999999999999
Insiders

917.399 --> 923.94
they're making it like you're part of

921.6 --> 926.279
the victory crew look at how much we

923.94 --> 927.48
have it under control but it's it's

926.279 --> 930.0
props

927.48 --> 931.98
it's fake it's like an act for the

930.0 --> 933.36
participants

931.98 --> 936.779
have you

933.36 --> 939.0
did you get that sense

936.779 --> 942.0
I'm kind of whispering because I'm just

939.0 --> 945.259
like whoa

942.0 --> 945.259
Can you feel it

945.959 --> 951.1199999999999
do you see what I mean

948.54 --> 953.48
with the comparison

951.12 --> 956.94
the the North Korea Outsider treatment

953.48 --> 961.019
but inside out it's actually for the

956.94 --> 965.82
Insiders partaking in this project

961.019 --> 967.68
to conceal for them how little control

965.82 --> 968.759
there actually is and that it's not

967.68 --> 973.2199999999999
really working

968.759 --> 973.22
what do you think guys let me know

973.38 --> 978.3
let me know

975.18 --> 980.16
about my idea here in the comparison

978.3 --> 982.7589999999999
there's some there's weird [ __ ] gonna

980.16 --> 982.759
happen guys

985.519 --> 991.74
yeah butt monkey pox for sure

990.6 --> 994.259
but

991.74 --> 998.1
like it's not gonna happen

994.259 --> 1000.38
maybe do yeah it's gonna be just the

998.1 --> 1002.12
same kind of [ __ ] nothing's really

1000.38 --> 1004.16
happening maybe a couple of weird

1002.12 --> 1006.32
isolated incidents and it's going to be

1004.16 --> 1008.18
very like why how did that come to be

1006.32 --> 1011.5400000000001
well it's not because any in fact that

1008.18 --> 1012.68
like that's immediately off the table

1011.54 --> 1016.04
right

1012.68 --> 1018.68
in like just like with

1016.04 --> 1021.5
the alleged disease

1018.68 --> 1023.899
of the last two years

1021.5 --> 1027.799
it's like yeah some peoples only get

1023.899 --> 1031.959
this really like oh lung problems

1027.799 --> 1031.959
but infected no

1032.059 --> 1036.62
there's no connection

1033.799 --> 1039.74
it just seems to happen right so maybe

1036.62 --> 1042.9189999999999
there will be people that just seemingly

1039.74 --> 1045.439
out of nowhere get these weird pox

1042.919 --> 1048.14
but then again there's already been so

1045.439 --> 1050.78
many people vaccinated with experimental

1048.14 --> 1053.96
stuff right

1050.78 --> 1057.1399999999999
that I kind of like

1053.96 --> 1060.38
at this point gamble it's a gamble but I

1057.14 --> 1063.8600000000001
think it's a good gamble that

1060.38 --> 1065.6000000000001
like it is primarily gonna come from

1063.86 --> 1068.4799999999998
people that are vaccinated so it's

1065.6 --> 1071.12
probably purely vaccine origin but it is

1068.48 --> 1073.46
a gamble I don't know this for sure yet

1071.12 --> 1075.4399999999998
but it seems a very logical gamble to

1073.46 --> 1078.6200000000001
make

1075.44 --> 1080.3600000000001
right it's a strong suspicion I'm

1078.62 --> 1082.52
probably not the only one

1080.36 --> 1086.1789999999999
because I just

1082.52 --> 1088.76
like unless you're like gonna eat

1086.179 --> 1092.0590000000002
kind of diseased monkeys or something or

1088.76 --> 1093.5
hang around or like God knows

1092.059 --> 1096.44
like

1093.5 --> 1098.38
get sexual or something I don't even

1096.44 --> 1102.2
want to know what some people might do

1098.38 --> 1104.9
right yeah that sort of [ __ ] Battleship

1102.2 --> 1107.96
I'm sure that's gonna give it to you

1104.9 --> 1111.0800000000002
if yeah but other than that

1107.96 --> 1113.6000000000001
like it's not just gonna go oh it's

1111.08 --> 1116.059
spreading around these people are

1113.6 --> 1117.5
infecting that's [ __ ] I just don't

1116.059 --> 1120.44
believe that I don't think that's

1117.5 --> 1124.52
possible I've never seen any

1120.44 --> 1128.0
like legitimate scientific evidence that

1124.52 --> 1129.799
that idea is anything other than just a

1128.0 --> 1132.559
science fiction model

1129.799 --> 1133.76
never seen any legitimate proof

1132.559 --> 1135.98
right

1133.76 --> 1138.64
so that's it

1135.98 --> 1138.64
foreign

1158.02 --> 1163.58
yeah psych bear well trying to get ahead

1161.539 --> 1167.14
of well just look at my title right

1163.58 --> 1167.1399999999999
solution reaction problem

1169.94 --> 1175.46
they literally created they don't wait

1172.52 --> 1178.16
for a problem to occur to react and then

1175.46 --> 1179.96
create a solution and take over no

1178.16 --> 1182.48
they conjure up

1179.96 --> 1184.3400000000001
something that's not there and try to

1182.48 --> 1185.3600000000001
give a solution for a problem that's not

1184.34 --> 1189.08
there

1185.36 --> 1191.799
that's they wait for the people to react

1189.08 --> 1194.84
fall for it and then the people that do

1191.799 --> 1197.48
become that problem

1194.84 --> 1200.6599999999999
that was claimed to be there but wasn't

1197.48 --> 1202.88
it was created see solution reaction

1200.66 --> 1206.299
problem

1202.88 --> 1209.72
it seems to be this new strategy of this

1206.299 --> 1212.0
madman to do that

1209.72 --> 1214.9
through illusion

1212.0 --> 1214.9
and Power

1221.6 --> 1227.059
people should still resist the tree of

1223.7 --> 1230.559
course BJC net absolutely the whole

1227.059 --> 1234.08
thing they should be just denounced

1230.559 --> 1236.1789999999999
worldwide by everybody just like we

1234.08 --> 1239.1789999999999
don't recognize you as a legitimate

1236.179 --> 1239.179
organization

1240.799 --> 1244.72
they should be denounced everywhere

1258.88 --> 1263.74
okay tell monoi too what

1268.039 --> 1274.1
Vapor okay really so terminology you

1272.059 --> 1276.32
think that there is some astrological

1274.1 --> 1278.4189999999999
related Magic

1276.32 --> 1281.6
that might occur

1278.419 --> 1284.7800000000002
or have occurred that would cause that

1281.6 --> 1286.48
to happen like a magical enchantment

1284.78 --> 1290.799
from

1286.48 --> 1290.799
Babylonian times or something that's

1291.02 --> 1296.36
or did I understand you wrong

1293.48 --> 1299.0
I mean I'm not excluding that but it's

1296.36 --> 1302.24
like I don't like yeah I can't really

1299.0 --> 1305.96
build a proper framework for to attempt

1302.24 --> 1307.94
to legitimize such train of thought it's

1305.96 --> 1309.679
a little bit too

1307.94 --> 1312.3400000000001
remote

1309.679 --> 1312.3400000000001
ah

1313.4 --> 1317.659
in the astrological case it would be

1315.38 --> 1320.24
totally fake well

1317.659 --> 1322.4
Terminal 2 I don't think that like the

1320.24 --> 1325.1200000000001
entire model that they suggest is even

1322.4 --> 1327.159
possible but

1325.12 --> 1330.26
influences right

1327.159 --> 1333.38
influences in the cycles and potential

1330.26 --> 1335.48
astrological influences might be like a

1333.38 --> 1337.94
thing that tips

1335.48 --> 1339.82
something inside

1337.94 --> 1344.3600000000001
to basically

1339.82 --> 1347.059
do it if it is like on the menu waiting

1344.36 --> 1349.52
list in your body right

1347.059 --> 1352.82
so maybe they've been able to sort of

1349.52 --> 1355.22
predict it and they just expect it to

1352.82 --> 1359.559
happen not because of an infection but

1355.22 --> 1359.559
because of some astrological situation

1360.08 --> 1365.36
sort of predicted

1362.059 --> 1367.46
and they're just like preempting it with

1365.36 --> 1370.6399999999999
their science fiction medical model

1367.46 --> 1373.4
trying to abuse the Astro potential

1370.64 --> 1375.5590000000002
astrological effect

1373.4 --> 1378.26
right

1375.559 --> 1380.539
it's a concept but

1378.26 --> 1383.799
there might be I've been hearing a lot

1380.539 --> 1390.3799999999999
of things also about this weird

1383.799 --> 1394.22
Celestial lineup of Mars and Jupiter and

1390.38 --> 1396.5590000000002
weird partial solar eclipse

1394.22 --> 1399.14
that have with the devil horns at the

1396.559 --> 1402.9189999999999
ocean at the Horizon really just weird

1399.14 --> 1405.38
Celestial things so maybe there's

1402.919 --> 1407.2990000000002
something or maybe it is all Pure

1405.38 --> 1409.5800000000002
Fantasy hype and they're just trying to

1407.299 --> 1410.72
up the pressure for people to basically

1409.58 --> 1412.76
blow up

1410.72 --> 1415.52
right up the pressure till they just

1412.76 --> 1417.5
lose it it could be that could be purely

1415.52 --> 1419.539
psychological and that there's nothing

1417.5 --> 1423.38
real about it absolutely nothing other

1419.539 --> 1426.559
than what might be coming from jabbies

1423.38 --> 1428.6000000000001
or there may be a potential Celestial

1426.559 --> 1431.4189999999999
phenomena where they think it might

1428.6 --> 1432.9189999999999
happen with certain people in certain

1431.419 --> 1435.74
conditions that they might have even

1432.919 --> 1439.8200000000002
like played towards that

1435.74 --> 1442.58
with ingredients in jabies

1439.82 --> 1445.299
who knows this is all highly speculative

1442.58 --> 1445.299
at this point

1446.299 --> 1449.02
uh

1457.46 --> 1465.14
astrology influences

1460.34 --> 1467.48
makes no sense to me well I like on a

1465.14 --> 1469.46
from a physics perspective like

1467.48 --> 1472.279
situation yeah I don't really get that

1469.46 --> 1474.74
either but I do know that like even moon

1472.279 --> 1478.36
cycles just have like pretty dramatic

1474.74 --> 1478.36
influences on their metabolism

1479.059 --> 1483.86
and

1481.1 --> 1486.3799999999999
that's like pretty solid

1483.86 --> 1489.08
so if that exists

1486.38 --> 1493.1000000000001
then yeah there might be other

1489.08 --> 1498.279
influences out there that are rarer

1493.1 --> 1498.279
right I am not too sure about it

1501.799 --> 1505.1
there might be a whole bunch of things

1503.299 --> 1508.4
that are just made up even by the

1505.1 --> 1510.6399999999999
Ancients or there might be something to

1508.4 --> 1510.64
them

1511.279 --> 1518.02
I've never really like

1514.059 --> 1521.0
specialized in like trying to remember

1518.02 --> 1524.5
influences of typical celestial events I

1521.0 --> 1527.539
just know a couple of things like the

1524.5 --> 1529.24
Association of comets appearing with

1527.539 --> 1532.779
like

1529.24 --> 1536.6
disastrous events like war or like

1532.779 --> 1538.88
natural catastrophe

1536.6 --> 1542.539
that's like an association that's just

1538.88 --> 1545.5390000000002
there I is it absolutely true well it

1542.539 --> 1547.34
might but why

1545.539 --> 1549.5
well

1547.34 --> 1552.1399999999999
maybe there is an influence that just

1549.5 --> 1555.08
like gives you a certain like changes

1552.14 --> 1557.38
the way input comes into your mind and

1555.08 --> 1560.24
people just get certain types of ideas

1557.38 --> 1562.8200000000002
that in whatever they're doing might

1560.24 --> 1565.22
typically result in everybody just like

1562.82 --> 1568.34
suddenly really get being sick of it and

1565.22 --> 1570.6200000000001
like we're gonna go to war right now

1568.34 --> 1571.76
out of nowhere almost oh who knows who

1570.62 --> 1574.34
knows man

1571.76 --> 1577.7
I don't know it's just

1574.34 --> 1579.9399999999998
a concept it's out there

1577.7 --> 1583.5800000000002
and there's just one

1579.94 --> 1585.559
Celestial influence that is and could be

1583.58 --> 1588.279
a mythology or there could be something

1585.559 --> 1588.279
real to it

1591.02 --> 1595.52
right

1593.179 --> 1598.1000000000001
but yeah a lot of it could be purely

1595.52 --> 1601.22
made up just to kind of have a storybook

1598.1 --> 1603.6789999999999
about the celestials and then just like

1601.22 --> 1605.72
play on the people's trust of the

1603.679 --> 1608.44
priesthood about it

1605.72 --> 1610.76
so they basically make these

1608.44 --> 1612.26
Association and if this lines up that

1610.76 --> 1614.24
means this and that and then everybody

1612.26 --> 1616.039
just believes it

1614.24 --> 1619.22
and then whatever influence it might

1616.039 --> 1621.919
have might become even secondary to the

1619.22 --> 1623.659
just the belief in the priesthood

1621.919 --> 1627.44
telling them this is how it will go

1623.659 --> 1630.7
right mind is a very

1627.44 --> 1630.7
Dynamic thing

1643.72 --> 1648.159
yeah pipe organs can be

1649.58 --> 1655.6999999999998
quite impactful on your sensories that's

1653.6 --> 1659.12
right

1655.7 --> 1661.3400000000001
like pipe organs can yeah they can

1659.12 --> 1663.559
frighten me if somebody's like playing

1661.34 --> 1665.72
something really dark on them and it's a

1663.559 --> 1667.34
big one then I would like I want to run

1665.72 --> 1671.1200000000001
out of that church

1667.34 --> 1674.059
because it's so dominant it is like so

1671.12 --> 1676.6999999999998
penetrates your system that sound from a

1674.059 --> 1679.1589999999999
big pipe organ so it really has to be

1676.7 --> 1680.6000000000001
just a good song played by somebody that

1679.159 --> 1684.14
is good natured

1680.6 --> 1687.08
or I'll feel like bad vibes like being

1684.14 --> 1689.2990000000002
forced upon me I've experienced that and

1687.08 --> 1690.799
literally I would be like I want to get

1689.299 --> 1694.1
out of here

1690.799 --> 1696.44
like really like help don't stop me I

1694.1 --> 1699.2199999999998
gotta get out of here right now this is

1696.44 --> 1699.22
something painful

1699.44 --> 1702.039
it's weird

1702.679 --> 1706.52
and I never have something like that

1704.6 --> 1708.26
like with a piano

1706.52 --> 1710.62
because it's just not it's different

1708.26 --> 1713.48
it's not that

1710.62 --> 1716.539
visceral it doesn't resonate like with

1713.48 --> 1717.799
your chest or anything too much it's

1716.539 --> 1719.419
more

1717.799 --> 1722.26
in your head

1719.419 --> 1722.26
with the piano

1722.84 --> 1726.74
for me in any way

1725.659 --> 1728.8400000000001
uh

1726.74 --> 1731.419
probably also because of the tone range

1728.84 --> 1733.1
piano is a lot higher tone

1731.419 --> 1735.76
on average

1733.1 --> 1735.76
uh

1736.64 --> 1742.8990000000001
they exactly when to hold the concepts

1739.94 --> 1742.8990000000001
for equipment

1746.539 --> 1750.919
I don't really understand your point

1748.82 --> 1753.52
here George Sanford about what you're

1750.919 --> 1753.5200000000002
describing

1754.58 --> 1760.6999999999998
they did a sort of events

1757.58 --> 1764.6
during a special time and then it made

1760.7 --> 1767.539
extra impact and people left crying and

1764.6 --> 1770.1399999999999
like having mental breaks

1767.539 --> 1770.14
okay

1770.779 --> 1776.26
it all depends on what were they playing

1772.88 --> 1776.2600000000002
on that pipe organ man

1780.26 --> 1785.84
but yeah it's it's like this dude if

1782.779 --> 1788.419
there is like a a strong full moon and

1785.84 --> 1789.4399999999998
it's like really clear at Sky right in

1788.419 --> 1791.8400000000001
the night

1789.44 --> 1795.0800000000002
well if you're gonna Gather in a church

1791.84 --> 1798.559

1795.08 --> 1801.74
a vampire on a really big church organ

1798.559 --> 1804.32
you're gonna be freaked out dude

1801.74 --> 1806.96
unless you're like completely numb

1804.32 --> 1808.82
naturally you're like you watch too much

1806.96 --> 1811.039
terrible things and you just nothing

1808.82 --> 1813.08
touches you anymore if you're a normal

1811.039 --> 1815.059
person you're gonna be freaked out if

1813.08 --> 1817.899
you're in a church during a full moon at

1815.059 --> 1822.1399999999999

1838.46 --> 1844.1000000000001
this is just really

1840.38 --> 1846.2600000000002
heavy right Wagner is so heavy

1844.1 --> 1850.6399999999999
it's a thing what I like about him but

1846.26 --> 1852.86
it also it can be depressing sometimes

1850.64 --> 1855.14
it's like I'd like Wagner but I wouldn't

1852.86 --> 1859.059
want to like listen to all of his music

1855.14 --> 1859.0590000000002
like hours and hours

1861.62 --> 1865.8799999999999
uh

1863.96 --> 1868.159
but I like his style

1865.88 --> 1870.3200000000002
and I like like when other classical

1868.159 --> 1873.22
music like even in video games kind of

1870.32 --> 1875.779
emulated style then I'm like yeah

1873.22 --> 1877.88
do it this is awesome

1875.779 --> 1880.34
just not too much and

1877.88 --> 1884.0590000000002

anyway it's all good

1913.159 --> 1917.179
I would appreciate it but don't have to

1916.22 --> 1919.84
do it

1917.179 --> 1919.8400000000001
uh

1940.7 --> 1945.039
the influence and do droplets

1946.22 --> 1952.22
that seems really

1949.22 --> 1952.22
Whimsy

1952.46 --> 1957.38
and I don't know was there any

1954.62 --> 1960.279
like fruitful result or was it just a

1957.38 --> 1960.279
bunch of meta talk

1975.32 --> 1980.46
foreign

1977.28 --> 1980.46
[Music]

1986.45 --> 1989.529
[Music]

2021.7 --> 2023.7
um

2033.1 --> 2041.279
what's a hermeticist well somebody that

2037.299 --> 2044.8799999999999
dabbles in and studies hermeticism

2041.279 --> 2044.88
I mean come on

2046.419 --> 2049.419
foreign

2053.619 --> 2060.28
that sounds like an oldie

2057.28 --> 2063.28
DBL

2060.28 --> 2063.28
DVR

2065.919 --> 2070.359
you can copy the disconnected post for

2067.96 --> 2071.44
you to you for free that's awesome or

2070.359 --> 2073.7799999999997
Tony

2071.44 --> 2075.879
what you could potentially do if you

2073.78 --> 2077.139
have like the capability like with a

2075.879 --> 2079.96
computer and all

2077.139 --> 2082.599
you could basically

2079.96 --> 2086.639
like

2082.599 --> 2086.639
turn it into an image

2086.74 --> 2093.1589999999997
right or even extract it into an mp4

2090.28 --> 2095.7400000000002
file like the main video of it I don't

2093.159 --> 2099.6400000000003
like need to move like the

2095.74 --> 2103.1189999999997
movie title card and all that right and

2099.64 --> 2106.1189999999997
then just send me the file

2103.119 --> 2108.94
or put it on a USB stick and send me

2106.119 --> 2110.079
that that would be easier than like a CD

2108.94 --> 2113.099
I think

2110.079 --> 2113.099
whatever you want

2115.599 --> 2120.119
uh hey Adam meakin good to see you

2150.579 --> 2155.04
right

2152.8 --> 2157.3
foreign

2155.04 --> 2161.079
travel if you don't know what that is

2157.3 --> 2163.78
and you want to dig into that

2161.079 --> 2166.9
I uploaded a video Once

2163.78 --> 2172.02
I think I did did I upload it

2166.9 --> 2172.02
or did I just link to it let me check

2172.54 --> 2179.32
sort by oldest yeah I did upload it it's

2176.44 --> 2182.339
like the first video I ever uploaded

2179.32 --> 2182.339
five years ago

2182.68 --> 2190.2599999999998
almost a four hour video of the kibalian

2186.579 --> 2190.26
of Hermes trim Augustus

2190.839 --> 2199.599
to my guess this right so that's

2195.579 --> 2202.5
pretty much sums it up it all right it's

2199.599 --> 2202.5
his main work

2203.14 --> 2208.359
so check that out

2205.48 --> 2211.44
or I could just link you to it

2208.359 --> 2211.44
it's even easier

2211.72 --> 2216.0989999999997
but yeah

2213.099 --> 2219.7000000000003
it's very impressed to come across it

2216.099 --> 2222.28
I am not fully subscribed to every part

2219.7 --> 2224.859
of it I'm not religious about his work

2222.28 --> 2227.8590000000004
but it's definitely

2224.859 --> 2231.46
systematic in a way that is very

2227.859 --> 2233.8199999999997
compatible to how I order information in

2231.46 --> 2233.82
my mind

2233.92 --> 2238.48
and how I regard the world

2236.32 --> 2241.8590000000004
like especially like the Living spirit

2238.48 --> 2241.859
element of it all

2243.7 --> 2248.859
and I think I've been expressing that

2245.859 --> 2251.7999999999997
and describing it very

2248.859 --> 2253.96
elaborately on my shows

2251.8 --> 2256.1800000000003
hey Godzilla

2253.96 --> 2260.099
good to see you back

2256.18 --> 2260.0989999999997
member for nine months awesome

2260.859 --> 2265.56
thank you

2262.3 --> 2265.5600000000004
thank you for the Super Chat

2269.56 --> 2275.92
is a short one are you serious

2272.68 --> 2279.359
the four hours is short one okay

2275.92 --> 2279.359
long enough for me though

2285.04 --> 2291.54
I mean after a while it does really

2286.78 --> 2291.5400000000004
become boring it just does

2291.64 --> 2296.44
it's very steady but eventually like I

2294.52 --> 2299.38
understand the pattern and he's just

2296.44 --> 2301.42
being too elaborate about too systematic

2299.38 --> 2304.06
like

2301.42 --> 2308.04
you yeah

2304.06 --> 2308.04
over focused I would say

2312.76 --> 2315.1800000000003
anyway

2318.4 --> 2325.26
August

2320.22 --> 2325.2599999999998
2016 will be six years ago soon yeah

2326.38 --> 2332.04
can't believe I've been over half a

2328.48 --> 2332.04
century here on this channel

2332.98 --> 2336.46
I don't think I would have ever imagined

2335.44 --> 2340.0
that

2336.46 --> 2341.8
before I was basically like I got it I

2340.0 --> 2344.5
gotta do shows

2341.8 --> 2346.7200000000003
I gotta tell people my ideas

2344.5 --> 2348.579
before I lose them

2346.72 --> 2350.5
that's what I thought

2348.579 --> 2352.7200000000003
and maybe it would have happened if I

2350.5 --> 2354.7
wouldn't have actually engaged in doing

2352.72 --> 2355.839
this then those ideas might have just

2354.7 --> 2358.06
like

2355.839 --> 2359.44
started loot me I would my frequency

2358.06 --> 2362.32
would

2359.44 --> 2364.18
start disconnecting even from Dark World

2362.32 --> 2366.46
memories and all that

2364.18 --> 2368.7999999999997
which did come about when I actually

2366.46 --> 2370.54
engaged

2368.8 --> 2373.5
but I didn't do that I actually did

2370.54 --> 2373.5
engage and

2376.599 --> 2380.44
I'm happy I did

2379.0 --> 2382.9
despite

2380.44 --> 2385.38
everything

2382.9 --> 2385.38
yeah

2388.359 --> 2395.339
oh did it say half a century

2391.54 --> 2395.339
I meant half a decade yeah

2403.3 --> 2409.2400000000002
what was the strike about does it change

2405.64 --> 2413.14
the future of the show not really

2409.24 --> 2416.2
but I do understand the problem though

2413.14 --> 2419.819
I was basically getting too angry

2416.2 --> 2422.98
and somebody basically tricked me into

2419.819 --> 2425.98
addressing a certain subject while I was

2422.98 --> 2428.8
angry and that basically gave them like

2425.98 --> 2432.46
a ratting out

2428.8 --> 2433.9
foreign clip

2432.46 --> 2436.839
and yeah

2433.9 --> 2439.0
they bought it right so all I have to do

2436.839 --> 2441.88
is basically ensure that if I'm gonna

2439.0 --> 2445.26
get angry that I'll not start talking

2441.88 --> 2445.26
about certain subjects

2447.819 --> 2453.22
and immediately kick out anybody that

2450.64 --> 2455.5
that tries to pull that out of the

2453.22 --> 2458.9199999999996
closet

2455.5 --> 2461.339
to lure me into that subject right and

2458.92 --> 2461.339
that's all

2461.5 --> 2467.14
did someone report yeah

2464.619 --> 2469.119
dude I've been bragging about it

2467.14 --> 2472.48
they're like really proud that they did

2469.119 --> 2476.98
that total scumbags

2472.48 --> 2476.98
like stazi psychos

2480.7 --> 2485.2799999999997
that's it's an insult in the stassi

2483.04 --> 2485.2799999999997
really

2488.859 --> 2494.7599999999998
they're much worse than that

2492.22 --> 2494.7599999999998
foreign

2499.96 --> 2503.7
you'll figure it out when it happens

2514.47 --> 2517.6499999999996
[Music]

2520.96 --> 2527.4
yeah

2522.64 --> 2527.4
but they basically try to entrap me

2532.96 --> 2539.26
see there you go they're all proud of it

2535.72 --> 2541.0
they're all proud to be sniveling evil

2539.26 --> 2543.0400000000004
scumbags

2541.0 --> 2546.819
they're okay with it

2543.04 --> 2548.98
because they've just polarized what I am

2546.819 --> 2551.92
what I do what I believe in what I talk

2548.98 --> 2555.22
about versus their convictions without

2551.92 --> 2558.2200000000003
any dynamic or growth Prospect and they

2555.22 --> 2563.16
just don't care anymore whether they're

2558.22 --> 2563.16
actually the baddies they don't care

2565.06 --> 2574.359
right in their bids to attack evil they

2570.52 --> 2576.94
have blatantly become much worse than

2574.359 --> 2579.54
the evil they envisioned to attack much

2576.94 --> 2579.54
much worse

2581.38 --> 2585.339
they thought they attacked an enemy and

2584.079 --> 2588.46
they thought they did the right thing

2585.339 --> 2591.64
and then they turned into demons

2588.46 --> 2593.5
when they refused to step away from the

2591.64 --> 2595.5989999999997
mistake

2593.5 --> 2600.24
so that's their fate now

2595.599 --> 2600.2400000000002
you're deranged and demonic now

2601.359 --> 2606.88
hope you realize that and that everybody

2603.579 --> 2609.7000000000003
can see that about you right separate

2606.88 --> 2611.619
from whether they agree with my

2609.7 --> 2614.2
philosophical position or yours

2611.619 --> 2618.96
everybody can see that and they will be

2614.2 --> 2618.96
able to see that in the future still

2619.42 --> 2624.839
yeah and then measure it all up way

2624.9 --> 2630.04
value and conviction

2628.06 --> 2632.22
and yeah it's not going to look good for

2630.04 --> 2632.22
you

2632.619 --> 2637.06
I'll be fine

2634.18 --> 2639.0989999999997
because I I back my arguments I back my

2637.06 --> 2640.66
statements I back my philosophies I back

2639.099 --> 2644.38
everything I do

2640.66 --> 2647.02
and I'm even willing to apologize when I

2644.38 --> 2649.7200000000003
figured out that I'm wrong about

2647.02 --> 2652.68
an angle of approach in something or

2649.72 --> 2652.68
an interaction

2659.079 --> 2665.6400000000003
you don't seem to have that luxury

2661.18 --> 2665.64
trolls so yeah I'm pity you

2677.44 --> 2681.28
some kind of glance yeah yeah kind of

2680.26 --> 2684.579
bear

2681.28 --> 2687.579
dude did you see them like on

2684.579 --> 2690.6400000000003
you would have had to be there alive but

2687.579 --> 2693.819
yesterday in ball busters like the chat

2690.64 --> 2695.2599999999998
was swarming with soccer cards like in

2693.819 --> 2697.66
an hour's time

2695.26 --> 2701.1400000000003
I was Banning like

2697.66 --> 2703.06
20 or 40 or something different soccer

2701.14 --> 2705.22
counts of people that were just like

2703.06 --> 2707.619
we're gonna get you I'm gonna get your

2705.22 --> 2710.2599999999998
show banned you're disgusting this that

2707.619 --> 2713.44
like they just would not they were just

2710.26 --> 2715.9
spamming sock accounts

2713.44 --> 2719.619
really really angry

2715.9 --> 2721.78
so angry they were literally like

2719.619 --> 2724.2000000000003
I'm not even gonna describe that's too

2721.78 --> 2724.2000000000003
gross

2725.8 --> 2732.3
like it was almost getting like sexual

2728.319 --> 2732.3
and violent really gross

2733.24 --> 2739.1189999999997
right but I I bend every one of them so

2735.88 --> 2742.2400000000002
in the replay you can't see there there

2739.119 --> 2745.119
and I basically adapted even just my

2742.24 --> 2748.839
conversation because I just really

2745.119 --> 2754.0
didn't care that they were doing that

2748.839 --> 2757.599
just removed it and left oh a bit small

2754.0 --> 2759.94
but still just a good conversation

2757.599 --> 2760.78
so you'll never even know they were

2759.94 --> 2763.06
there

2760.78 --> 2765.2200000000003
right now that's good moderation when

2763.06 --> 2767.2599999999998
you never even figure out that there

2765.22 --> 2770.4489999999996
were trolls in there

2767.26 --> 2770.449
[Music]

2774.16 --> 2778.42
right because that's the that's the the

2776.8 --> 2781.1800000000003
biggest victory

2778.42 --> 2782.5
if you can just remove the trolls when

2781.18 --> 2785.7999999999997
they appear

2782.5 --> 2789.4
and not leave any trace of them

2785.8 --> 2791.98
in your own memory really except for oh

2789.4 --> 2792.819
it happens but no substantial memory of

2791.98 --> 2797.02
it

2792.819 --> 2799.24
no Trace within the video for people to

2797.02 --> 2801.04
bump into right so that's why you don't

2799.24 --> 2802.1189999999997
address them because then oh yeah it's

2801.04 --> 2805.06
there

2802.119 --> 2807.4
it literally somebody else not getting

2805.06 --> 2810.4
banned addressing the troll yeah now it

2807.4 --> 2814.14
is a there is a trace see because you

2810.4 --> 2814.14
had to say something

2814.599 --> 2819.2200000000003
if you literally ignore them like the

2817.66 --> 2822.04
Amish would

2819.22 --> 2824.2
right just like no I'm just not going to

2822.04 --> 2827.74
recognize you're there

2824.2 --> 2830.2599999999998
and then it will turn out later that

2827.74 --> 2832.839
they weren't ever there they're just

2830.26 --> 2834.8190000000004
gone nobody even talks like there was

2832.839 --> 2838.9
somebody trolling

2834.819 --> 2841.18
and it's all good no Trace complete wipe

2838.9 --> 2844.2400000000002
of the negative influence because nobody

2841.18 --> 2848.2599999999998
addressed it see

2844.24 --> 2851.5
well that is a strategical approach

2848.26 --> 2854.3190000000004
it's one that I want to

2851.5 --> 2856.78
emphasize more I want to try that out

2854.319 --> 2859.96
including with you guys to help you

2856.78 --> 2861.88
train in that like how to really deal

2859.96 --> 2864.28
with trolls I mean

2861.88 --> 2866.38
you can have like in a certain mood back

2864.28 --> 2868.3590000000004
and forth right although I don't like

2866.38 --> 2871.98
that in my chat too much

2868.359 --> 2871.98
especially if it gets gross

2872.14 --> 2876.22
but

2873.88 --> 2877.96
yeah when they're just in the way or or

2876.22 --> 2880.9599999999996
they're just like oh no this guy's gonna

2877.96 --> 2883.54
ruin my mood don't let them literally

2880.96 --> 2884.98
just don't connect like they're not

2883.54 --> 2886.66
there

2884.98 --> 2888.64
really there

2886.66 --> 2892.02
and when they're removed

2888.64 --> 2892.02
they will not be there

2892.059 --> 2899.6800000000003
and afterward then it's will nobody will

2896.5 --> 2902.92
know that they were there so why

2899.68 --> 2905.859
give it away that they were there

2902.92 --> 2907.9
by addressing it while they're there

2905.859 --> 2910.48
right now of course if you're gonna say

2907.9 --> 2912.52
oh numpty alert that's General that's

2910.48 --> 2915.579
like in general

2912.52 --> 2916.839
then it's like oh somebody probably came

2915.579 --> 2919.3
in

2916.839 --> 2921.5789999999997
but of course they're gone right but

2919.3 --> 2924.099
you're not addressing the troll that way

2921.579 --> 2926.94
you're just giving an empty alert so

2924.099 --> 2926.94
that works perfect

2927.339 --> 2929.94
all right

2930.64 --> 2937.7799999999997
so yeah let's do this just

2934.0 --> 2939.83
let's just get Amish on these trolls

2937.78 --> 2945.01
they don't exist

2939.83 --> 2945.0099999999998
[Music]

2948.14 --> 2952.839
[Music]

2950.38 --> 2955.059
they remove any comments questioning the

2952.839 --> 2957.4
CDI yeah well George Sanford it's their

2955.059 --> 2959.8590000000004
freaking channel the entire point of it

2957.4 --> 2961.3
is to create an illusion if people want

2959.859 --> 2963.5789999999997
to believe it

2961.3 --> 2965.6800000000003
it's not the place you're not gonna go

2963.579 --> 2968.92
to a magician's Act

2965.68 --> 2970.8999999999996
to while the guy is doing a magician's

2968.92 --> 2974.319
act which is where what people come for

2970.9 --> 2976.42
and pay him for start ruining the ACT

2974.319 --> 2978.2799999999997
while he's do you don't do that you get

2976.42 --> 2980.079
kicked out of course you get kicked out

2978.28 --> 2981.7000000000003
might even get arrested or something

2980.079 --> 2984.04
right

2981.7 --> 2987.339
duh

2984.04 --> 2989.92
but yeah if people go to those NASA

2987.339 --> 2992.4
streams they're coming for that

2989.92 --> 2992.4
right

2993.4 --> 2999.28
now if they have senses and good

2997.119 --> 3002.2200000000003
parenting that will teach them to

2999.28 --> 3004.92
question things to get Socratic then

3002.22 --> 3008.04
they will figure it out right

3004.92 --> 3009.96
but if you're gonna barge in like a

3008.04 --> 3011.7599999999998
Heckler and just start ruining The

3009.96 --> 3013.14
Magicians act yeah why are you

3011.76 --> 3016.26
complaining that you're getting kicked

3013.14 --> 3018.54
out I mean that's what it's there for

3016.26 --> 3020.4
it's not a debating Channel or like with

3018.54 --> 3022.079
anti-flat authors that want the flat

3020.4 --> 3023.94
earthers in so everybody can get all

3022.079 --> 3027.3590000000004
gamma rage on you and all that right

3023.94 --> 3031.079
well they're inviting you there

3027.359 --> 3034.2599999999998
NASA live streams aren't they are not

3031.079 --> 3037.319
open for debate it's an act

3034.26 --> 3040.98
that's how it's formatted they're not

3037.319 --> 3044.02
there to interact with flat earthers

3040.98 --> 3047.239
understand just realize that

3044.02 --> 3047.239
[Music]

3047.579 --> 3050.3
uh

3051.66 --> 3056.7
unless it's like an open question and

3054.0 --> 3059.16
answer thing or something right

3056.7 --> 3061.98
could you imagine like a YouTube live

3059.16 --> 3065.8799999999997
stream with like ISS people where

3061.98 --> 3068.7
they're gonna ask questions in the chat

3065.88 --> 3070.859
when it's actually live and you can see

3068.7 --> 3074.24
that that they're reading the chat oh

3070.859 --> 3077.0989999999997
man I know that would be like

3074.24 --> 3079.2599999999998
so much of a seduction to get in there

3077.099 --> 3080.46
as a flat earther and be like hey

3079.26 --> 3082.7400000000002
uh

3080.46 --> 3085.44
your strings are showing or something

3082.74 --> 3087.66
right you'd have to do that almost if it

3085.44 --> 3089.88
was actually live but yeah I've never

3087.66 --> 3094.0989999999997
seen an actual live stream with people

3089.88 --> 3094.099
on the ISS like that

3095.76 --> 3100.28
I think they do that just in private

3097.92 --> 3100.28
events

3106.22 --> 3110.54
SpaceX live streams are the most

3112.8 --> 3118.5
okay I guess so

3116.4 --> 3120.48
I just think it's all really boring

3118.5 --> 3122.7
actually

3120.48 --> 3124.98
but maybe that's also because there is

3122.7 --> 3126.8999999999996
no backed up excitement for something

3124.98 --> 3128.579
real that's happening because I know

3126.9 --> 3131.119
it's

3128.579 --> 3131.119
fake

3132.9 --> 3136.6800000000003
so

3134.339 --> 3138.9
the build up thing doesn't really work

3136.68 --> 3140.64
then if you think something really is

3138.9 --> 3142.5
going to happen then sitting through

3140.64 --> 3144.2999999999997
kind of the boring padding and all that

3142.5 --> 3145.92
yeah that might be worth it but if you

3144.3 --> 3147.78
know it's fake

3145.92 --> 3150.599
then it's just gonna be boring and

3147.78 --> 3153.2000000000003
padding so yeah

3150.599 --> 3153.2000000000003
you know

3162.3 --> 3166.319
people spam in NASA live chat all the

3165.54 --> 3168.54
time

3166.319 --> 3171.0
yeah but that's okay because that's just

3168.54 --> 3173.7
the general degeneration of social

3171.0 --> 3175.5
behavior on the internet as long as

3173.7 --> 3178.14
they're misbehaving but they don't

3175.5 --> 3180.66
realize that space is fake then they're

3178.14 --> 3183.9
fine with it but if you're gonna

3180.66 --> 3186.18
get all spammy and trolley as a flatter

3183.9 --> 3188.4
then they have a problem because they

3186.18 --> 3191.94
don't mind if you're deranged as long as

3188.4 --> 3195.26
you don't try to ruin the magic act see

3191.94 --> 3195.26
that's what it's all about

3197.76 --> 3202.079
although if you're gonna get really

3199.619 --> 3204.44
gross then they might do something about

3202.079 --> 3204.44
that

3205.319 --> 3207.5
foreign

3213.14 --> 3216.98
306 what did you expect

3217.44 --> 3224.9
I used to see hundred of flat earthers

3219.599 --> 3224.9
well that's probably in the early years

3225.119 --> 3230.94
like 2015 to 17 and I think that they're

3229.5 --> 3233.339
just like

3230.94 --> 3235.319
catching on that they basically have to

3233.339 --> 3238.4
do something to prevent people from

3235.319 --> 3238.4
ruining their act

3238.619 --> 3246.48
I mean Banning flat earthers from

3242.359 --> 3249.42
live space events

3246.48 --> 3251.339
like only seems logical if you actually

3249.42 --> 3254.2400000000002
want to have some kind of successful

3251.339 --> 3254.24
magicians Act

3254.77 --> 3260.46
[Music]

3257.04 --> 3262.2599999999998
right they've just been sloppy at first

3260.46 --> 3264.2400000000002
so maybe they're now actually starting

3262.26 --> 3269.059
to make an effort to really get a

3264.24 --> 3269.0589999999997
cohesive image back or the belief

3273.839 --> 3280.38
uh what

3276.3 --> 3283.2000000000003
bubbles floating up someone that's it

3280.38 --> 3286.76
okay Tony that's special

3283.2 --> 3286.7599999999998
those are interesting moments

3291.42 --> 3295.14
they just got afraid of me and dropped

3293.4 --> 3298.26
yeah

3295.14 --> 3300.24
oh turret you can be quite

3298.26 --> 3302.4
robust

3300.24 --> 3306.6189999999997
in your commentary

3302.4 --> 3306.619
right so yeah

3306.78 --> 3311.8190000000004
if you're going to be like that

3309.0 --> 3313.68
I'd be afraid too if I was a space

3311.819 --> 3316.2799999999997
magician trying to convince everybody

3313.68 --> 3316.2799999999997
it's real

3323.6 --> 3326.79
[Music]

3333.599 --> 3338.46
and I think they do also like trace your

3336.359 --> 3341.22
channel and all that right they do look

3338.46 --> 3343.619
like there's there I'm pretty sure they

3341.22 --> 3345.4199999999996
do have moderators that do actually just

3343.619 --> 3346.559
check channels that are active

3345.42 --> 3349.7000000000003
commenting

3346.559 --> 3352.1400000000003
especially if they mention risque

3349.7 --> 3354.799
subjects they'll just check hey is this

3352.14 --> 3354.799
a flat earther

3363.85 --> 3367.0699999999997
[Music]

3367.92 --> 3373.76
yeah but turret look once they ban your

3370.319 --> 3373.7599999999998
channel they don't unban it

3375.0 --> 3380.04
[Music]

3378.24 --> 3382.7599999999998
came back on with the different clip

3380.04 --> 3382.7599999999998
very blurry

3383.46 --> 3388.68
like damn it bubbles are showing quickly

3385.859 --> 3390.119
lower the resolution

3388.68 --> 3392.2799999999997
yeah

3390.119 --> 3394.819
yeah that's that's a special moment Tony

3392.28 --> 3394.8190000000004
with him

3417.839 --> 3420.5
huh

3429.18 --> 3433.319
oh really

3430.74 --> 3436.52
where's that from I don't know

3433.319 --> 3436.52
Beth Dutton

3441.66 --> 3444.44
who is that

3461.52 --> 3466.4
the TV show Yellowstone okay

3466.44 --> 3471.599
I don't know if I've ever watched that I

3469.2 --> 3474.1189999999997
have heard of it I don't think I really

3471.599 --> 3477.619
bumped into it on Netflix

3474.119 --> 3477.619
or something I don't know

3490.92 --> 3494.76
yeah I'm still watching Blake 7 by the

3493.619 --> 3497.339
way

3494.76 --> 3501.5400000000004
and there's some really really

3497.339 --> 3504.9
remarkable details in there like

3501.54 --> 3508.319
that are like shocking to me now

3504.9 --> 3510.6600000000003
that like that's just a part of the show

3508.319 --> 3512.099
like did you know that they have like

3510.66 --> 3516.54
the

3512.099 --> 3516.54
what's that what they call it um no

3518.819 --> 3521.48
call it again

3525.599 --> 3531.599
what is basically the Empire but they

3527.76 --> 3531.599
don't call it that uh

3533.46 --> 3538.14
it's not like starfleeters ah damn it I

3536.46 --> 3539.819
don't remember what they call it it's

3538.14 --> 3543.18
basically the empire

3539.819 --> 3546.9
it is kind of Star Wars like

3543.18 --> 3549.0
but yeah Blake seven style and they have

3546.9 --> 3552.599
like special soldiers that they

3549.0 --> 3555.54
basically turn into vampires

3552.599 --> 3559.2000000000003
mutants

3555.54 --> 3562.079
the Federation that was it right

3559.2 --> 3565.46
like they have mutants and they're they

3562.079 --> 3568.44
all seem to be girls which is weird

3565.46 --> 3570.2400000000002
they're all women those mutants they

3568.44 --> 3573.059
have like special Helmet or something

3570.24 --> 3575.7599999999998
but whatever but they basically suggest

3573.059 --> 3578.46
like these are modified humans and they

3575.76 --> 3580.619
become like vampiric dependent but as

3578.46 --> 3582.119
long as they have red blood cells they

3580.619 --> 3584.46
can become

3582.119 --> 3586.92
they don't age and they get like

3584.46 --> 3589.5
vampire-like Powers very strong

3586.92 --> 3591.66
and they they're not affected by cold

3589.5 --> 3594.18
and all that really like a vampire but

3591.66 --> 3596.7599999999998
they can run out of the juice and then

3594.18 --> 3600.44
they become really weak

3596.76 --> 3600.44
like that's freaky man

3600.54 --> 3604.7
that's freaking that's the 80s

3605.04 --> 3613.68
and that's like a standard thing

3608.88 --> 3613.6800000000003
of the Federation there wow

3614.76 --> 3619.3190000000004
just pretty shocking with like some

3617.64 --> 3621.5989999999997
developments that we are getting

3619.319 --> 3623.46
confronted with in current age at least

3621.599 --> 3625.799
through conspiracy theorizing and all

3623.46 --> 3628.319
that like holy [ __ ]

3625.799 --> 3630.9
sounds like day Walkers no they're

3628.319 --> 3635.0589999999997
modified genetically modified humans

3630.9 --> 3635.059
that like become vampires

3636.48 --> 3641.94
also the Federation makes a big habit of

3639.54 --> 3645.66
just erasing people's minds and

3641.94 --> 3647.339
reprogramming them just full-on MK Ultra

3645.66 --> 3649.5
but heavier

3647.339 --> 3652.319
and that's even like the starting plot

3649.5 --> 3654.9
with Lake seven like he didn't know he

3652.319 --> 3657.66
was even like a rebellious leader once

3654.9 --> 3661.28
because they completely erased his mind

3657.66 --> 3661.2799999999997
that's all the the pilot episode

3662.22 --> 3668.64
yeah surveillance like the intro of

3664.98 --> 3670.799
Blake 7 like tells the entire story and

3668.64 --> 3672.54
the music is so freaking catchy that

3670.799 --> 3674.88
sometimes it's like a nightmare that

3672.54 --> 3677.7
they can't get it out of my head

3674.88 --> 3680.6400000000003
they basically show it it's like

3677.7 --> 3684.8999999999996
a soldier with a mask on

3680.64 --> 3689.9
like very very much mass covered

3684.9 --> 3689.9
surveillance camera mind control

3690.18 --> 3695.46
and space stuff

3693.18 --> 3698.16
that's like those are the things you get

3695.46 --> 3700.579
to see in the intro and it tells you

3698.16 --> 3700.5789999999997
everything

3702.9 --> 3705.559
huh

3708.78 --> 3713.099
yeah drug pacification too that's like

3711.119 --> 3714.9
standardized it's like oh yeah let's

3713.099 --> 3717.599
just spray them

3714.9 --> 3719.4
with this amount of suppressants they're

3717.599 --> 3722.339
just like yeah that's just standard

3719.4 --> 3724.98
policy there holy [ __ ]

3722.339 --> 3727.2
so it is extremely dystopic really

3724.98 --> 3729.9
because of the normalization of all

3727.2 --> 3734.839
these applications they're they're like

3729.9 --> 3734.839
they're being full-on Nazi about it

3735.9 --> 3742.02
and it's all very reminiscent of an

3738.66 --> 3745.2
attitude that we're seeing right now

3742.02 --> 3747.5389999999998
in certain groups of people that think

3745.2 --> 3750.8999999999996
they're taking over the world it is so

3747.539 --> 3753.7200000000003
similar it's uncanny in ways

3750.9 --> 3756.539
and it you don't find it like that in

3753.72 --> 3758.8799999999997
any other series not like that like they

3756.539 --> 3762.26
really made effort to have this cohesive

3758.88 --> 3762.26
image of what it's like

3765.839 --> 3771.359
there was a real Vision behind the

3768.119 --> 3773.339
series it's just that it was operated

3771.359 --> 3775.799
like a soap opera

3773.339 --> 3778.38
but there was a very cohesive vision of

3775.799 --> 3781.52
what that universe is like and how

3778.38 --> 3781.52
people do things

3783.54 --> 3787.02
[Music]

3785.039 --> 3789.48
yeah

3787.02 --> 3791.46
exactly the ordinary citizens of the

3789.48 --> 3793.2
Federation don't realize how corrupt it

3791.46 --> 3796.2200000000003
is exactly

3793.2 --> 3796.22
that's like

3796.74 --> 3803.22
it is really powerful in a science

3801.0 --> 3805.98
fiction setting

3803.22 --> 3808.6189999999997
I mean it looks super dated the acting

3805.98 --> 3810.66
is sometimes really good sometimes it's

3808.619 --> 3814.1400000000003
like okay

3810.66 --> 3818.7599999999998
the fighting scenes is laugh out loud

3814.14 --> 3821.64
ridiculous it's like oh

3818.76 --> 3823.6800000000003
like really stupid like kitty [ __ ] but

3821.64 --> 3825.9
it's it's funny and it doesn't matter

3823.68 --> 3827.0989999999997
they're not Fighters they're all soap

3825.9 --> 3829.5
actors

3827.099 --> 3832.26
they're not doing battle they're not

3829.5 --> 3834.72
doing any Maneuvers it's all really the

3832.26 --> 3837.3190000000004
fighting scenes are just silly

3834.72 --> 3837.319
but

3837.42 --> 3843.42
other than those things the story is

3840.72 --> 3845.3999999999996
like holy [ __ ]

3843.42 --> 3848.76
really

3845.4 --> 3852.02
really remarkable how much Vision they

3848.76 --> 3852.0200000000004
had for the future

3852.48 --> 3855.079
ah

3858.42 --> 3863.46
I remember when Tim peaky was in the

3862.079 --> 3866.6400000000003
background in front of a green screen

3863.46 --> 3868.5
what no I don't remember that sorry I

3866.64 --> 3870.5389999999998
don't know who that is is that part of

3868.5 --> 3874.52
the show I don't think so

3870.539 --> 3874.5200000000004
they don't really even use green screen

3876.839 --> 3882.18
it's all sets and Outdoors

3880.079 --> 3884.539
they really love like Refinery

3882.18 --> 3887.3999999999996
industrial buildings

3884.539 --> 3889.88
and then they make you imagine it's like

3887.4 --> 3894.42
a space station or something brilliant

3889.88 --> 3896.52
brilliant so cheap so effective

3894.42 --> 3898.64
I'm still talking about Blake 7 by the

3896.52 --> 3898.64
way

3905.52 --> 3910.02
never heard of this show

3907.559 --> 3912.2400000000002
yeah well you can't really find the

3910.02 --> 3914.9
whole thing on YouTube but you can find

3912.24 --> 3914.8999999999996
the pilot

3916.079 --> 3921.48
and you will laugh at certain some parts

3919.2 --> 3923.339
of the special effects you oh you will

3921.48 --> 3924.48
be clutch you will laugh your freaking

3923.339 --> 3927.72
ass off

3924.48 --> 3932.94
but the story itself is like immediately

3927.72 --> 3935.2799999999997
like really like bang it is like

3932.94 --> 3938.46
Star Wars The Empire Strikes Back The

3935.28 --> 3940.26
Heavy moments fully except it is not

3938.46 --> 3944.7
yeah

3940.26 --> 3948.599
the scenario is like that heavy but

3944.7 --> 3951.72
it is like not as Fantastical actors

3948.599 --> 3954.7200000000003
although yeah with what they make did

3951.72 --> 3958.02
they make do right and the props are

3954.72 --> 3960.5989999999997
really cheap quickly made but the story

3958.02 --> 3963.5
itself is like really heavy especially

3960.599 --> 3963.5
in the first episode

3963.66 --> 3966.3799999999997
yes

3966.9 --> 3973.14
right but yeah if you if you want to

3969.539 --> 3977.119
watch that I was able to find a good

3973.14 --> 3977.1189999999997
source that downloaded from

3978.9 --> 3983.1600000000003
through torrent

3980.76 --> 3985.1400000000003
I still have it I got it pretty much

3983.16 --> 3987.839
entirely downloaded so I could

3985.14 --> 3989.64
potentially but I'm not gonna do it in

3987.839 --> 3992.16
this chat I could give you like the

3989.64 --> 3994.68
torrent link

3992.16 --> 3996.48
so you could download it that way

3994.68 --> 3998.7599999999998
because you're not gonna find all the

3996.48 --> 4001.099
episodes on YouTube when I tried there

3998.76 --> 4003.079
was a whole bunch of like Idiot Live

4001.099 --> 4004.6400000000003
streamers that just had the title of

4003.079 --> 4009.319
that show didn't make any sense had

4004.64 --> 4011.859
nothing to do with it very very elusive

4009.319 --> 4011.859
so

4012.92 --> 4016.299
oh Seth willenberg

4019.4 --> 4022.0
okay

4033.859 --> 4039.2599999999998
I'm not sure Tony would go I do remember

4036.2 --> 4041.1189999999997
there was this moment when I was on

4039.26 --> 4044.9
camera where you would see like a really

4041.119 --> 4047.359
weird a ball just moving like this

4044.9 --> 4048.98
with like a weird Grid in the background

4047.359 --> 4051.4
I I don't know if that's what you're

4048.98 --> 4051.4
talking about

4052.52 --> 4055.96
I'm not sure anyway

4056.119 --> 4060.88
cool send that to me uh yeah in Skype

4058.7 --> 4060.8799999999997
right

4063.2 --> 4066.0389999999998
okay

4069.38 --> 4077.119
to get this

4072.44 --> 4082.66
copy magnet your yeah that's it

4077.119 --> 4082.6600000000003
okay can you speak up in chat

4093.37 --> 4099.269
[Music]

4113.299 --> 4116.62
and I'm back

4118.94 --> 4121.239
foreign

4133.37 --> 4136.43
[Music]

4159.259 --> 4161.799
foreign

4168.98 --> 4172.659
if you've never seen Blake 7 before

4171.38 --> 4176.42
think

4172.659 --> 4177.92
of like Buck Rogers

4176.42 --> 4180.859
but

4177.92 --> 4183.38
not [ __ ] because Buck Rogers was

4180.859 --> 4185.779
absolutely [ __ ]

4183.38 --> 4187.9400000000005
I'm sorry it was entertaining but it was

4185.779 --> 4191.540000000001
really dumb in ways and like it wasn't

4187.94 --> 4194.12
very intellectually stimulating at all

4191.54 --> 4197.36
only people that seemed intelligent were

4194.12 --> 4200.48
just weirdo eugenicist futurists was

4197.36 --> 4203.12
dumb Blake 7 is quite the opposite it's

4200.48 --> 4205.94
very serious gritty

4203.12 --> 4207.14
bit gamma here and there

4205.94 --> 4210.08
but

4207.14 --> 4212.06
like it's all very serious and it looks

4210.08 --> 4215.0599999999995
it's British it's very British there's

4212.06 --> 4217.659000000001
everybody has like their own very they

4215.06 --> 4222.080000000001
put a lot of effort in speaking English

4217.659 --> 4225.0199999999995
with their in their way and that's like

4222.08 --> 4226.76
amusing that part alone is just cool

4225.02 --> 4229.1
it's interesting and they develop it

4226.76 --> 4231.26
they get better at it over time at first

4229.1 --> 4233.06
it's like a bit clunky they get really

4231.26 --> 4236.02
good at it

4233.06 --> 4236.02
ah

4236.54 --> 4240.38
love me some bug Ridge when it was like

4238.34 --> 4242.54
three well yeah well as if you're a

4240.38 --> 4244.6990000000005
super little kid then Buck Rogers is

4242.54 --> 4246.5
great because it doesn't matter it's

4244.699 --> 4247.94
completely [ __ ] because you're a

4246.5 --> 4250.64
super little kid

4247.94 --> 4252.379999999999
right well this series is definitely not

4250.64 --> 4254.900000000001
for little kids

4252.38 --> 4257.3
I'd say

4254.9 --> 4260.36
like 12 years and older at least there's

4257.3 --> 4262.88
a lot of violence it gets very scary

4260.36 --> 4265.58
like it actually gets scary

4262.88 --> 4268.46
like I wouldn't want to show that to any

4265.58 --> 4271.0
kid even with parents being there

4268.46 --> 4271.0
right

4272.36 --> 4277.4
like I think that they allowed me to

4274.699 --> 4279.86
watch when I was like eight and nine but

4277.4 --> 4282.5599999999995
most of it I I got really excited like

4279.86 --> 4285.86
if it were Star Wars or something but I

4282.56 --> 4289.96
just didn't get the grittiness I didn't

4285.86 --> 4289.96
get the harshness of it at all

4290.06 --> 4293.3
it was much later than I said that I

4292.4 --> 4296.0
really

4293.3 --> 4298.360000000001
started to understand like the value of

4296.0 --> 4298.36
the story

4300.98 --> 4305.48
right

4302.6 --> 4306.9800000000005
so so if you like bug Rogers you're

4305.48 --> 4309.32
probably going to be very interested in

4306.98 --> 4313.699
watching this series the storyline is

4309.32 --> 4317.0
much much better and it is a very big

4313.699 --> 4319.659
developing storyline basically

4317.0 --> 4319.659
it is

4321.26 --> 4326.360000000001
although not as great as the developing

4323.78 --> 4329.0
storyline of like Babylon 5 which is

4326.36 --> 4331.58
like epic that storyline is

4329.0 --> 4334.34
a giant Epic

4331.58 --> 4336.98
this one

4334.34 --> 4338.659000000001
it's not that big but it is really

4336.98 --> 4340.28
interesting

4338.659 --> 4341.719
the things that happen and the

4340.28 --> 4342.7699999999995
characters

4341.719 --> 4345.979
anyway

4342.77 --> 4345.979
[Music]

4351.08 --> 4355.719
it's British that's why you never seen

4352.82 --> 4355.719
it ah right

4358.4 --> 4363.759999999999
oh have fun with that might take some

4361.28 --> 4366.5599999999995
getting used to

4363.76 --> 4370.6
especially the sets which look really

4366.56 --> 4370.6
cheap and it doesn't get better

4374.6 --> 4379.280000000001
but if you get in the story then the

4376.4 --> 4381.759999999999
sets just don't don't matter anymore

4379.28 --> 4381.759999999999
anyway

4390.24 --> 4393.3
[Music]

4411.44 --> 4419.98
oh exciting we've never heard of that

4414.62 --> 4419.98
Aaron Schwartz well maybe the name but

4443.42 --> 4446.5
don't do that

4447.44 --> 4450.44
foreign

4488.6 --> 4491.320000000001
thank you

4508.83 --> 4511.93
[Music]

4523.28 --> 4526.33
[Music]

4529.04 --> 4532.36
yeah sorry about that

4534.08 --> 4537.64
it's communicating with clutch

4538.0 --> 4541.36
on Skype

4551.86 --> 4557.48
downloading digital text and education

4555.02 --> 4559.719
yeah that's really odd turning weight

4557.48 --> 4559.718999999999
gun

4563.0 --> 4570.38
he was doing seminars oh oh okay Tony

4568.04 --> 4572.84
but then

4570.38 --> 4574.9400000000005
there's a different issue you see if

4572.84 --> 4577.82
you're doing seminars

4574.94 --> 4580.299999999999
and well obviously making money well

4577.82 --> 4583.94
then he is basically using people

4580.3 --> 4587.12
people's work that they downloaded and

4583.94 --> 4590.419999999999
making money off it that is

4587.12 --> 4592.28
the standard for an actual copyright

4590.42 --> 4594.02
violation

4592.28 --> 4596.96
right

4594.02 --> 4599.360000000001
if he was making money off it then he

4596.96 --> 4601.78
should have paid

4599.36 --> 4605.259999999999
the sources he should have actually

4601.78 --> 4605.259999999999
officially bought it

4608.02 --> 4612.38
26. oh

4609.92 --> 4615.02
that sucks

4612.38 --> 4618.7390000000005
right so that's the problem look if he

4615.02 --> 4621.860000000001
just downloaded it all and not make

4618.739 --> 4623.78
money with it

4621.86 --> 4625.639999999999
then they would have probably left him

4623.78 --> 4626.719
alone but if you're gonna make a

4625.64 --> 4629.900000000001
business

4626.719 --> 4631.34
I just out of work that isn't that you

4629.9 --> 4634.82
didn't pay for

4631.34 --> 4636.8
then they're gonna come after you

4634.82 --> 4638.9
what he wasn't earning anything but

4636.8 --> 4641.84
doing seminars what he was doing

4638.9 --> 4644.86
seminars for free

4641.84 --> 4644.860000000001
how does that work

4662.6 --> 4666.56
okay well doesn't sound logical to me at

4665.42 --> 4669.38
all

4666.56 --> 4672.400000000001
it sounds like it could completely be

4669.38 --> 4672.400000000001
made up I'm sorry

4673.64 --> 4677.9800000000005
I mean that just makes no sense at all

4691.62 --> 4694.8
[Music]

4702.92 --> 4707.8
right

4705.62 --> 4707.8
foreign

4710.719 --> 4716.2390000000005
now as a potential alternative what the

4714.32 --> 4718.34
kid could have done and this is of

4716.239 --> 4721.28
course all afterward talk

4718.34 --> 4723.62
right if we downloaded all that stuff

4721.28 --> 4727.04
then he could have simply

4723.62 --> 4729.38
not used it raw but write his own book

4727.04 --> 4731.78
where he literally would have to like

4729.38 --> 4735.679
translate everything

4731.78 --> 4738.0199999999995
to like his system that isn't obviously

4735.679 --> 4739.82
lent from the original work and then he

4738.02 --> 4742.46
would be able to come out with his book

4739.82 --> 4744.08
even try the sources maybe pay here and

4742.46 --> 4746.9
there it's just that's how it works

4744.08 --> 4750.5
that's how you could actually do it

4746.9 --> 4752.78
if you're blatantly gonna rip off like

4750.5 --> 4756.46
use inspiration that you haven't paid

4752.78 --> 4756.46
for to make a product

4756.62 --> 4760.58
even if you're gonna give it away for

4758.48 --> 4763.58
free to other people right unless you

4760.58 --> 4766.699
keep it completely private

4763.58 --> 4770.12
the Beast will come after you it just

4766.699 --> 4773.178999999999
will and it has nothing to do with

4770.12 --> 4774.5599999999995
that's unfair or something no it's just

4773.179 --> 4779.06
how it works

4774.56 --> 4781.820000000001
people have paid the system

4779.06 --> 4782.719
right to have those copyrights for their

4781.82 --> 4786.62
work

4782.719 --> 4788.659
and that's like very basic contracts and

4786.62 --> 4791.179
that's just how it is

4788.659 --> 4792.799999999999
if you're gonna use it make a profit or

4791.179 --> 4795.26
like give it away for free they're gonna

4792.8 --> 4798.1
come after you

4795.26 --> 4798.1
they just will

4799.699 --> 4803.9
unfortunately right with some things

4802.04 --> 4806.42
it's unfortunately

4803.9 --> 4809.299999999999
because I think personally that

4806.42 --> 4812.36
like having movies

4809.3 --> 4815.0
and all that videos available like

4812.36 --> 4817.339999999999
entertainment movies and videos

4815.0 --> 4819.86
to have that available for free is

4817.34 --> 4822.1990000000005
actually better for business

4819.86 --> 4824.12
because a lot more people will get to

4822.199 --> 4827.719
know it and if it's good

4824.12 --> 4830.0599999999995
then it will spread much quicker and

4827.719 --> 4833.12
grow much bigger in popularity which

4830.06 --> 4835.6990000000005
will it also attract more people that

4833.12 --> 4837.679
are just very willing to pay for it

4835.699 --> 4840.08
right

4837.679 --> 4844.54
but that's different from

4840.08 --> 4847.4
like educational work and like mechanics

4844.54 --> 4851.0199999999995
patented systems right that's very

4847.4 --> 4851.0199999999995
different when it's just entertainment

4866.54 --> 4872.239
what

4868.1 --> 4875.56
ghost writers wow that's sick

4872.239 --> 4875.5599999999995
that's a monstrous

4890.36 --> 4894.98
if you're just gonna ghost right that's

4892.699 --> 4897.5599999999995
just basically

4894.98 --> 4899.78
money laundering but with

4897.56 --> 4902.2390000000005
with information it's information

4899.78 --> 4904.159
laundering that's really terrible I mean

4902.239 --> 4905.839999999999
if you're gonna build your own thing out

4904.159 --> 4907.58
of something else

4905.84 --> 4909.5
you know then you're making something

4907.58 --> 4914.179
new but if you're literally just gonna

4909.5 --> 4918.159
basically copy it and avoid sir like to

4914.179 --> 4921.7390000000005
copy it as as as exactly as possible

4918.159 --> 4924.82
avoiding judicial things that's that's

4921.739 --> 4924.82
just stealing

4933.62 --> 4936.099999999999
anyway

4949.88 --> 4955.3
it's like bear don't bring that up

4953.12 --> 4955.3
foreign

4969.03 --> 4972.2
[Music]

4982.12 --> 4988.34
s like that there's like a blatant

4985.88 --> 4992.56
suggestion

4988.34 --> 4992.56
even if you didn't mean it like that

4999.44 --> 5005.099999999999
the kid was writing computer code six

5001.9 --> 5005.099999999999
okay sure

5006.4 --> 5012.099999999999
right so he was probably just overly

5009.34 --> 5014.92
burdened with talent and it got to him

5012.1 --> 5017.1990000000005
because yeah if somebody is too good and

5014.92 --> 5020.34
basically cracking a lot of the

5017.199 --> 5024.94
mechanics of the system

5020.34 --> 5027.28
then they're taking power

5024.94 --> 5028.659
without any checks and balances

5027.28 --> 5032.259999999999
blackmail

5028.659 --> 5034.659
yeah if you literally just take their

5032.26 --> 5036.639
power through shared Talent they're

5034.659 --> 5039.94
probably gonna kill you

5036.639 --> 5043.139
that's right if it becomes too blatant

5039.94 --> 5043.138999999999
that's how it works

5052.48 --> 5055.379999999999
foreign

5058.08 --> 5065.299
[Music]

5099.88 --> 5103.26
okay well bring it up

5105.1 --> 5110.639
foreign

5107.46 --> 5110.639
to something

5110.8 --> 5116.159000000001
merely reflecting upon subjects brought

5113.56 --> 5116.159000000001
up by the chat

5119.86 --> 5123.599999999999
so with the name like that

5124.48 --> 5130.919999999999
probably a troll we'll see so yeah show

5128.26 --> 5130.92
me what you got

5141.82 --> 5145.92
yes seeking star water so did I

5186.639 --> 5191.4400000000005
oh okay

5189.04 --> 5193.42
it's my opinion Gene editing because

5191.44 --> 5196.239
it's something you've delved into and

5193.42 --> 5197.62
have interest in no

5196.239 --> 5201.48
not really

5197.62 --> 5201.48
I think it's a terrible idea

5205.659 --> 5211.54
I think people that think you can just

5208.36 --> 5212.98
go edit jeans they have no idea what the

5211.54 --> 5217.8
hell they're doing

5212.98 --> 5217.799999999999
they don't know the long-term effects

5219.82 --> 5224.0199999999995
right you only get to see the effects

5222.219 --> 5226.12
like in a couple of generations you

5224.02 --> 5227.26
don't get to see the full picture over a

5226.12 --> 5229.719
thousand years

5227.26 --> 5231.06
although you might get hints at it my

5229.719 --> 5234.76
personal

5231.06 --> 5238.3
approach like the the axioms you could

5234.76 --> 5239.7390000000005
say that I think are there concerning it

5238.3 --> 5242.4400000000005
is that

5239.739 --> 5245.82
any attempt to meddle with genetics is

5242.44 --> 5247.48
eventually going to stack up a

5245.82 --> 5251.38
accumulate

5247.48 --> 5256.239
into an end result of

5251.38 --> 5258.04
gradual sterilization and gradual mental

5256.239 --> 5262.48
derangement

5258.04 --> 5266.08
and probably primarily psychopathy

5262.48 --> 5269.5
that's what I think that it will lead to

5266.08 --> 5273.1
whether it might yield seemingly good

5269.5 --> 5275.139
results at first right

5273.1 --> 5277.900000000001
if you'd actually like completely

5275.139 --> 5281.679
changed that if you'd allow the changing

5277.9 --> 5284.32
of human genetics to then procreate and

5281.679 --> 5286.78
Abate it you don't know what the end

5284.32 --> 5288.639
result will be or hey maybe some people

5286.78 --> 5290.259999999999
out there do know it and they do it

5288.639 --> 5293.8
anyway

5290.26 --> 5296.26
and I think that it will always lead to

5293.8 --> 5299.62
sterilization

5296.26 --> 5303.159000000001
like the inability to procreate and to

5299.62 --> 5306.099999999999
deranged mental Behavior

5303.159 --> 5309.0599999999995
or aberrant mental Behavior we will

5306.1 --> 5309.06
probably start like that

5314.44 --> 5319.62
possible no

5316.42 --> 5319.62
I don't know who you are

5320.679 --> 5326.5
I'm not just going to be like hey hello

5322.78 --> 5328.599999999999
guy that I've never seen before and just

5326.5 --> 5331.84
noticed five minutes ago yeah I'll

5328.6 --> 5334.0
invite you live on my show uh no no

5331.84 --> 5339.360000000001
thank you

5334.0 --> 5339.36
but you can lay out your ideas in chat

5341.44 --> 5344.46
plenty of room

5361.9 --> 5365.44
what are you talking about sleeping star

5363.88 --> 5368.9400000000005
water

5365.44 --> 5368.94
a little Cleary by the way

5391.6 --> 5398.38
oh okay to add a DNA strands Criminal

5395.679 --> 5401.38
well

5398.38 --> 5403.3
it's really criminal if it's illegal

5401.38 --> 5406.56
is it illegal

5403.3 --> 5406.56
I don't know if it is

5406.78 --> 5410.28
in my opinion it should be

5411.1 --> 5416.08
I mean

5412.78 --> 5418.36
in ways like perfected cross breeding

5416.08 --> 5420.82
and all that is already

5418.36 --> 5423.759999999999
in in areas where it's kind of pushing

5420.82 --> 5426.5199999999995
things right like through cross breeding

5423.76 --> 5428.5
which is like natural selection based

5426.52 --> 5430.96
engineering

5428.5 --> 5432.699
there's like breeds of dogs out there

5430.96 --> 5434.9800000000005
that are just like what the hell are you

5432.699 --> 5438.4
doing with this creature

5434.98 --> 5442.78
like they don't live very long they're

5438.4 --> 5445.12
often mentally deranged hey yeah

5442.78 --> 5450.34
what did you expect that's what happens

5445.12 --> 5452.26
even with regular cross breeding right

5450.34 --> 5454.84
but

5452.26 --> 5458.400000000001
yeah if you're gonna like literally just

5454.84 --> 5462.04
change genetics in ways then

5458.4 --> 5465.94
you we don't understand genetics okay

5462.04 --> 5468.46
like the the fractal complications

5465.94 --> 5470.08
long-term results is like we shouldn't

5468.46 --> 5472.78
be meddling with it because yeah there

5470.08 --> 5475.0599999999995
might be on the surface certain things

5472.78 --> 5476.98
that might be like oh yeah this seems to

5475.06 --> 5478.179
now work more efficient like in that

5476.98 --> 5480.759999999999
case but

5478.179 --> 5484.26
how do you know that's all you're

5480.76 --> 5484.26
changing you don't know

5485.62 --> 5491.199
there's epigenetics and there is just

5488.139 --> 5493.3
like the effect of changing genetics

5491.199 --> 5498.12
that in itself I think is being

5493.3 --> 5498.12
underestimated of what it actually does

5498.4 --> 5506.04
just changing it like that may have like

5501.88 --> 5506.04
a long-term bad consequences

5506.139 --> 5512.5
like sterility right and I mean with the

5510.1 --> 5515.38
leadership out there right now it's not

5512.5 --> 5518.199
like oh oh no we can't unleash genetic

5515.38 --> 5523.179
modification on the people they might

5518.199 --> 5526.239
get sterile oh no oh they're so so

5523.179 --> 5528.84
concerned with that I mean that's a real

5526.239 --> 5532.599999999999
disaster to them if that would happen

5528.84 --> 5535.12
uh no they'd absolutely love it because

5532.6 --> 5539.38
they're demonic eugenesis that won

5535.12 --> 5541.36
everybody's sterile and dead so yeah

5539.38 --> 5544.56
there might be these influences and

5541.36 --> 5544.5599999999995
they're not even telling people

5552.76 --> 5559.1990000000005
no I'm not gonna have you on my show I

5556.3 --> 5559.1990000000005
don't know who you are

5561.73 --> 5565.959999999999
[Music]

5562.84 --> 5568.6
and you can precisely explain what

5565.96 --> 5570.84
you're saying in the chat just take your

5568.6 --> 5570.84
time

5577.54 --> 5584.76
I'm doing it I'm saying it you can say

5580.719 --> 5584.76
it too you can say your things there too

5585.04 --> 5590.58
you've conversed with me before on this

5587.02 --> 5590.580000000001
yeah that whatever

5591.1 --> 5593.88
it's my show

5601.42 --> 5608.26
should do something about my dead ends

5605.139 --> 5610.3
excuse me I don't need advice thank you

5608.26 --> 5614.320000000001
very much I do take care of my hair I've

5610.3 --> 5616.3
had long hair more than half my life

5614.32 --> 5618.759999999999
is still there

5616.3 --> 5620.02
I think I know best how to deal with my

5618.76 --> 5621.9400000000005
hair

5620.02 --> 5624.52
okay and I do

5621.94 --> 5626.799999999999
take care of the Dead ends too

5624.52 --> 5628.96
I just don't do it like all the time

5626.8 --> 5631.3
because get guess what happens when you

5628.96 --> 5633.219
do that yeah

5631.3 --> 5635.860000000001
it just gets shorter and shorter hair

5633.219 --> 5638.28
right I take great care of my hair

5635.86 --> 5638.28
thanks

5640.12 --> 5642.78
foreign

5655.6 --> 5661.3
right

5657.46 --> 5664.719
but yeah it's very simple

5661.3 --> 5667.12
Fashion Corner oh dear

5664.719 --> 5669.28
getting kind of gay

5667.12 --> 5672.82
enough

5669.28 --> 5674.92
but like yeah this it's basic system you

5672.82 --> 5675.88
want to some for some reason get on my

5674.92 --> 5677.62
show

5675.88 --> 5681.34
then

5677.62 --> 5684.219
contact me on Skype we can chat

5681.34 --> 5686.860000000001
and then if you really want to be on

5684.219 --> 5689.26
live with me on my show

5686.86 --> 5691.0599999999995
we're gonna have to do a Skype call face

5689.26 --> 5694.619000000001
to face

5691.06 --> 5697.679
before I will consider that

5694.619 --> 5701.799999999999
I'm not gonna have like a virgin

5697.679 --> 5704.82
appearance face to face on my live show

5701.8 --> 5704.820000000001
I don't do that

5704.98 --> 5708.839999999999
not on this specific show

5711.04 --> 5715.239
right some other people out there might

5712.96 --> 5717.88
do that like Jim Bob he likes like yeah

5715.239 --> 5720.099999999999
whoever like you've been as a psychopath

5717.88 --> 5722.32
or a smart person or just a deranged

5720.1 --> 5724.2390000000005
person he'll just like face them live in

5722.32 --> 5728.679
the moment and be perfect about okay

5724.239 --> 5732.04
goody I'm not Jim Bob though

5728.679 --> 5735.3
so I don't do it like that and that's

5732.04 --> 5735.3
just the way I do it

5735.46 --> 5737.88
okay

5747.1 --> 5753.1
right yeah that also right

5750.34 --> 5755.92
that yeah because if somebody's gonna

5753.1 --> 5758.08

5763.84 --> 5767.9400000000005
that they're holding that back

5768.4 --> 5774.159
they will not be able to act

5770.98 --> 5776.199
convincingly holding it back in order to

5774.159 --> 5779.5599999999995
do that afterward

5776.199 --> 5781.299999999999
I will know that they're doing that that

5779.56 --> 5785.679
they're planning to do that I will

5781.3 --> 5788.320000000001
detect it with my senses

5785.679 --> 5792.2390000000005
and I'm not wrong

5788.32 --> 5792.239

5942.699 --> 5946.08
those things it was interesting

5949.119 --> 5953.04
it was like an interesting experiment

5963.76 --> 5969.58
okay Seth wildenberg

5966.04 --> 5971.679

5969.58 --> 5973.659

you can call it

5992.199 --> 5995.94
poor gnomes

6099.239 --> 6105.44
usually when I get like that

I add

6106.8 --> 6113.42
this smiley

6108.96 --> 6113.42
the signal that I am kind of joking

6171.06 --> 6175.080000000001
you're in that subtle amount of

microwave all day long and you can't

she do super bad things if you

6222.719 --> 6228.3
like have toxic influences like if you

6225.96 --> 6231.6
abused parts of your body

6228.3 --> 6232.92
or you like have toxic waste enter your

6231.6 --> 6236.219

6242.4 --> 6246.54
it's not

6243.9 --> 6250.82
like that it has nothing to do

6246.54 --> 6254.76
with some infectious Micro Entity

6250.82 --> 6256.139
that is colloquially called a virus

6254.76 --> 6258.719
right

6256.139 --> 6263.46
nothing to do with it whatsoever

6258.719 --> 6267.8
just a a situation caused by toxic

6263.46 --> 6267.8
environment and abuse

6270.0 --> 6274.5
and this whole

6272.04 --> 6277.1
monkey butt ox

6274.5 --> 6277.1
I

6278.219 --> 6282.9
like

6280.02 --> 6285.540000000001
I just don't think it's gonna happen

6282.9 --> 6287.879999999999
at all

6285.54 --> 6291.0
except for a few people that already

6287.88 --> 6292.86
have completely screwed up systems

6291.0 --> 6295.02
right from

6292.86 --> 6297.54
from Jabs and all that

6295.02 --> 6300.06
and they might lit like that's what I

6297.54 --> 6301.5
said earlier I think that it might be in

6300.06 --> 6303.96
there

6301.5 --> 6306.42
because their system is all screwed up

6303.96 --> 6309.179
and they have Fades and all that

6306.42 --> 6311.0
that it is in there and then they might

6309.179 --> 6313.679
get it and it might even be like

6311.0 --> 6315.78
radiologically triggered or something I

6313.679 --> 6317.46
don't know just speculation I don't know

6315.78 --> 6320.04
if that's actually how it'll happen or

6317.46 --> 6321.6
it is just naturally incubates and then

6320.04 --> 6324.06
suddenly comes out

6321.6 --> 6326.639
might have been timed I don't know

6324.06 --> 6327.860000000001
but I I definitely don't think it's

6326.639 --> 6332.78
gonna be

6327.86 --> 6332.78
contagious beyond the vexed

6333.84 --> 6336.5
at all

6338.699 --> 6342.98
I am not worried in the slightest

6384.659 --> 6391.138999999999
right yeah

6387.78 --> 6394.139
and what you said too

6391.139 --> 6396.4800000000005
George Sanford it might be just a purely

6394.139 --> 6398.639
hypothetical event and everybody's just

6396.48 --> 6402.178999999999
anticipating that it's real

6398.639 --> 6405.26
but literally nothing might ever happen

6402.179 --> 6408.96
like literally zero cases and anybody

6405.26 --> 6411.54
they might literally roll out just

6408.96 --> 6414.0
crisis act cases where it's just pure

6411.54 --> 6416.699
makeup and and everything about it is

6414.0 --> 6418.8
just not real it might be like that

6416.699 --> 6421.98
I don't know

6418.8 --> 6424.76
I haven't heard of any like

6421.98 --> 6424.759999999999
cases

6425.159 --> 6429.199
like in the Western World at all

6433.56 --> 6439.139
right in the meantime yeah like Tony

6436.08 --> 6442.08
whitcombs is saying uh the amount of

6439.139 --> 6445.1990000000005
side effects and damage and deaths

6442.08 --> 6448.8
caused by the previous session of

6445.199 --> 6451.138999999999
jabbing is like it's still going there's

6448.8 --> 6453.3
still people like literally just

6451.139 --> 6456.84
dropping dead at sport contests

6453.3 --> 6459.0
literally every time now every time I

6456.84 --> 6461.219
hear oh there was this oh guess what

6459.0 --> 6463.8
somebody died again during it oh yeah

6461.219 --> 6466.38
yeah that's like yeah that's that's what

6463.8 --> 6470.28
happens now apparently

6466.38 --> 6473.2390000000005
right so damage is already done

6470.28 --> 6473.239
most of it

6473.34 --> 6475.9400000000005
so

6478.26 --> 6488.06
ew Godzilla that's so so dark

6483.9 --> 6488.0599999999995
that's really freaking gross

6499.4 --> 6507.0
The New Normal no it's not normal it's

6503.639 --> 6509.58
child sacrifice and people did it

6507.0 --> 6512.4
they did it to their own kids they

6509.58 --> 6514.38
literally murdered them and they didn't

6512.4 --> 6516.179
even realize it

6514.38 --> 6519.0
or maybe they did maybe they're just so

6516.179 --> 6522.9
fanatical they'll do whatever

6519.0 --> 6525.84
to please the system or something

6522.9 --> 6529.619
but it's absolutely absurd every parent

6525.84 --> 6532.32
that has ever had their kid jab with

6529.619 --> 6535.5599999999995
this stuff that rolled out in the last

6532.32 --> 6538.0199999999995
two years they should all be deprived of

6535.56 --> 6540.0
the right to bear children they should

6538.02 --> 6542.540000000001
just not be allowed to have children in

6540.0 --> 6542.54
my opinion

6542.58 --> 6547.639
it's just an opinion but yeah I really

6545.58 --> 6551.04
do think so I think that it's a sign of

6547.639 --> 6552.36
severe mental incompetence and the

6551.04 --> 6555.239
arrangement

6552.36 --> 6557.598999999999
that you allowed your kid to be jacked

6555.239 --> 6557.598999999999
like that

6570.659 --> 6572.839999999999
foreign

6579.86 --> 6586.86
and by the way the same goes for parents

6583.679 --> 6589.38
that even at home

6586.86 --> 6591.839999999999
Force everybody to wear masks

6589.38 --> 6594.4800000000005
because then if they're little kids

6591.84 --> 6597.719
right if they're like under 10 because

6594.48 --> 6599.0599999999995
then they're literally creating a

6597.719 --> 6602.34
permanent

6599.06 --> 6604.56
mental handicap for your kid

6602.34 --> 6607.860000000001
some of them might literally never learn

6604.56 --> 6609.84
to properly talk because of that

6607.86 --> 6610.98
this is

6609.84 --> 6615.719
that's

6610.98 --> 6618.178999999999
child abuse I'm sorry it is child abuse

6615.719 --> 6620.159
you're literally giving your kid a

6618.179 --> 6621.719
handicap that they probably will never

6620.159 --> 6625.619
overcome

6621.719 --> 6627.3
that's called child abuse

6625.619 --> 6630.36
provable

6627.3 --> 6633.08

6654.0 --> 6657.9
go to events and yeah they have to you

6656.159 --> 6659.759999999999
have to wear masks

6657.9 --> 6661.92
right now you match your kid up I get it

6659.76 --> 6665.34
that's sick

6661.92 --> 6668.4
as long as they at least like at home

6665.34 --> 6672.06
can just be normal people can be able to

6668.4 --> 6674.339999999999
read your lips as you communicate right

6672.06 --> 6676.9800000000005

6674.34 --> 6679.679
you force kids and you yourself wear

6676.98 --> 6684.178999999999
masks and when they're very young that's

6679.679 --> 6687.599
palpable provable child abuse there's

6684.179 --> 6691.7390000000005
absolutely no logical reason to do to do

6687.599 --> 6693.719

6691.739 --> 6695.759999999999
to do that

in spirit right and it's palpable

6967.619 --> 6972.78
it's not like just goofing around

6969.719 --> 6975.9
wasting your time not listening you're

6972.78 --> 6978.0599999999995
all actually tuning in into what I talk

6975.9 --> 6981.259999999999
about and into each other

6978.06 --> 6981.26
like a gathering

6986.94 --> 6991.5
and that's when things really get

6988.619 --> 6994.259999999999
rolling that's when real ideas pop up

6991.5 --> 6996.54
that's when your memory

6994.26 --> 6999.3
works the best when you're all

6996.54 --> 7000.86
interfacing like that and building

6999.3 --> 7004.400000000001
at least building in your mind building

7000.86 --> 7005.839999999999
ideas comparing things applying Socratic

7004.4 --> 7008.36
method

7005.84 --> 7010.52
that's when your faculties really start

7008.36 --> 7012.86
to work

7010.52 --> 7015.5
right

7012.86 --> 7017.839999999999
and yeah the same counts for me yeah if

7015.5 --> 7021.8
I'm just on my own

7017.84 --> 7024.7390000000005
I don't really think that elaborately

7021.8 --> 7027.26
I feel more I have more space to feel

7024.739 --> 7029.36
right and then later my thinking can be

7027.26 --> 7032.2390000000005
guided by those feelings

7029.36 --> 7035.0
right it's alone I can't attune very

7032.239 --> 7038.598999999999
well where I go with my frequency

7035.0 --> 7041.48
but the real intellectual rollouts

7038.599 --> 7043.34
happen when I interact with somebody

7041.48 --> 7047.0
else

7043.34 --> 7050.119000000001
because then it's like because there is

7047.0 --> 7052.4
an insurance to me that it will not be

7050.119 --> 7054.0199999999995
wasted when I do it

7052.4 --> 7057.32
I adapt

7054.02 --> 7060.4400000000005
my rollout to the inquiry to the level

7057.32 --> 7063.08
of the person that is inquiring and

7060.44 --> 7066.199
that's just how it works

7063.08 --> 7069.619
and so if somebody's really sharp

7066.199 --> 7072.4
in nature has a lot of depth then I will

7069.619 --> 7075.199
like be able to like

7072.4 --> 7078.219
attune to that level

7075.199 --> 7078.219
just like that

7079.04 --> 7082.54
it's a special ability

7092.96 --> 7099.199
and it's also by the way a case of just

7097.219 --> 7103.219
owning it

7099.199 --> 7105.5
just saying like yeah I can adapt to any

7103.219 --> 7107.719
person's level

7105.5 --> 7109.94
even if they're like really deeply

7107.719 --> 7111.9800000000005
studied or even if they think that

7109.94 --> 7114.138999999999
they're all that and it might be all

7111.98 --> 7116.718999999999
that they might have great ability and

7114.139 --> 7117.92
quality and products production and

7116.719 --> 7121.76
everything

7117.92 --> 7123.7390000000005
but I claim it I stated and I love to be

7121.76 --> 7126.38
tested that

7123.739 --> 7128.9
I do understand

7126.38 --> 7130.52
not too much everything I come across

7128.9 --> 7132.259999999999
unless it is

7130.52 --> 7135.38
very technical

7132.26 --> 7137.4800000000005
and I can't connect it because it's like

7135.38 --> 7139.34
too remote and connected really because

7137.48 --> 7140.78
I don't really understand like what is

7139.34 --> 7144.38
really the point

7140.78 --> 7147.199
if it's like too technical

7144.38 --> 7149.900000000001
to specialists

7147.199 --> 7152.299999999999
like if I would bump into other people

7149.9 --> 7154.759999999999
that are like both engineers and they're

7152.3 --> 7156.7390000000005
really deep in their fields and they're

7154.76 --> 7158.96
like discussing I like Engineers among

7156.739 --> 7160.759999999999
one another then I might have a bit of

7158.96 --> 7162.92
trouble like following because they're

7160.76 --> 7165.320000000001
like Specialists talking and that's a

7162.92 --> 7166.639
different way of communicating I am not

7165.32 --> 7169.099
a specialist

7166.639 --> 7172.639
but if a person would be willing to kind

7169.099 --> 7176.4800000000005
of entertain me

7172.639 --> 7180.400000000001
with that help me understand then I can

7176.48 --> 7183.04
actually with some help with people

7180.4 --> 7187.159
basically giving me the green light

7183.04 --> 7189.92
integrate like if I were and then I will

7187.159 --> 7193.839999999999
start to get it

7189.92 --> 7193.84
but it requires acceptance

7194.0 --> 7199.76
requires acceptance by other people

7197.3 --> 7202.099
to give me the benefit of the doubt that

7199.76 --> 7205.280000000001
I can adapt

7202.099 --> 7209.26
that they and that I'm allowed by their

7205.28 --> 7209.259999999999
egos to be on the same level

7210.199 --> 7215.48
right that I'm not there as competition

7212.96 --> 7217.34
to like oh look I'm just as good as you

7215.48 --> 7219.5
now I'm gonna kick you down because I

7217.34 --> 7221.7390000000005
want to be the better one I never do

7219.5 --> 7221.739
that

7222.56 --> 7227.780000000001
and I hope people rely on that fact that

7226.28 --> 7230.96
I never do that

7227.78 --> 7232.94
because that will help them to allow me

7230.96 --> 7235.4
to interface

7232.94 --> 7239.54
so I can get to that level

7235.4 --> 7241.699
like it's not my information it's not my

7239.54 --> 7244.34
knowledge it's God's knowledge and we're

7241.699 --> 7246.5599999999995
all sharing that's how I see it and

7244.34 --> 7250.0
that's also what allowed me to basically

7246.56 --> 7250.0
take the limiter off

7252.679 --> 7258.5
as in all information is mine and it's

7256.28 --> 7262.58
everybody else's as well

7258.5 --> 7265.639
but can they be responsible with it

7262.58 --> 7268.58
right I mean I could like for a person

7265.639 --> 7271.159000000001
that might have like great potential but

7268.58 --> 7273.44
be like morally deranged yeah I could

7271.159 --> 7276.138999999999
lift them out and show them like the

7273.44 --> 7277.5199999999995
Perfection of their mechanics but

7276.139 --> 7280.46
they're morally to range so what are

7277.52 --> 7283.76
they going to do with it well it's more

7280.46 --> 7286.4
likely to expect that they're probably

7283.76 --> 7288.7390000000005
going to abuse it in some way and not do

7286.4 --> 7290.48
the right thing with it so should I be

7288.739 --> 7291.678999999999
informing them then

7290.48 --> 7293.839999999999
no

7291.679 --> 7297.1990000000005
that's why I don't if I don't trust a

7293.84 --> 7299.659000000001
person to be correct with the

7297.199 --> 7302.178999999999
information that I could provide that

7299.659 --> 7306.219
I'm just not gonna give it to them in a

7302.179 --> 7306.219
way that they can abuse

7319.42 --> 7322.78
virus yeah

7349.52 --> 7354.320000000001
okay I don't know about that one

7351.139 --> 7357.6990000000005
Godzilla a bit of an over generalization

7354.32 --> 7357.699
next yeah

7358.219 --> 7365.119
but yeah look if you're declared in

7361.58 --> 7369.38
media if you've given the role of expert

7365.119 --> 7372.38
in the media is completely separate from

7369.38 --> 7375.92
actual expertise in a field by a person

7372.38 --> 7378.139
okay it's very different one does not

7375.92 --> 7381.139
match the other at all

7378.139 --> 7383.4800000000005
I mean in media it can be just a front

7381.139 --> 7385.099
just an excuse

7383.48 --> 7387.32
to convince

7385.099 --> 7389.78
right and then they're not actually an

7387.32 --> 7392.179
expert they're just following a script

7389.78 --> 7395.179
but yeah in the field that doesn't work

7392.179 --> 7397.46
at all if you're not an expert in what

7395.179 --> 7399.1990000000005
you do then yeah it'll just not work

7397.46 --> 7400.88
what you're doing and people will

7399.199 --> 7402.199
recognize that you're fumbling you're

7400.88 --> 7403.58
not good at it

7402.199 --> 7405.799999999999
right

7403.58 --> 7408.619
so

7405.8 --> 7411.88
it all depends what type of expert we're

7408.619 --> 7411.88
talking about Godzilla

7415.34 --> 7420.9800000000005
right or TV experts read a book a real

7418.58 --> 7423.82
expert writes the book

7420.98 --> 7423.82
indeed

7433.76 --> 7438.860000000001
export implies one of those experience

7435.94 --> 7442.28
experimented no no not necessarily but

7438.86 --> 7444.5599999999995
was field tested the concepts

7442.28 --> 7446.9
who knows from

7444.56 --> 7450.079000000001
applied experiences that's not

7446.9 --> 7451.4
necessarily experimentation

7450.079 --> 7453.259999999999
I mean it's not excluding

7451.4 --> 7455.179
experimentation but that's not a

7453.26 --> 7456.579000000001
necessity

7455.179 --> 7459.02
foreign

7456.579 --> 7461.599
it's experience

7459.02 --> 7464.3
knowing what happens know what everybody

7461.599 --> 7467.42
will bump into as they

7464.3 --> 7470.0
focus on that field that's what makes

7467.42 --> 7472.719
real expertise somebody who's seen the

7470.0 --> 7472.719
things happening

7478.099 --> 7480.76
hey what

7487.099 --> 7491.92
right pgfc net

7489.139 --> 7491.92
thank you

7493.699 --> 7500.598999999999
it is my backup Channel basically if

7497.599 --> 7503.360000000001
something goes wrong with the YouTube

7500.599 --> 7506.4400000000005
I don't anticipate it going wrong

7503.36 --> 7506.44
anytime soon though

7519.56 --> 7525.38
ah Godzilla not yeah I'm just being

7523.099 --> 7528.32
nitpicky I know what you mean I don't

7525.38 --> 7530.4800000000005
think that in the an expert has to fail

7528.32 --> 7532.82
before they succeed

7530.48 --> 7534.799999999999
they just have to redo it and if they

7532.82 --> 7537.86
succeed at first yeah then it's very

7534.8 --> 7540.26
tempting to think that you mastered it

7537.86 --> 7542.78
well try again and see if you still

7540.26 --> 7544.46
succeed now if you constantly keep

7542.78 --> 7547.04
succeeding

7544.46 --> 7549.8
then you could say yeah I'm a naturally

7547.04 --> 7552.26
talented expert at it because I can't

7549.8 --> 7553.400000000001
seem to feel this

7552.26 --> 7556.96
right

7553.4 --> 7561.079
so failure isn't a universal

7556.96 --> 7563.96
necessity for success but if you're not

7561.079 --> 7568.5199999999995
a natural Talent added from the get-go

7563.96 --> 7570.76
then it is essential to proceed your

7568.52 --> 7570.76
skill

7571.099 --> 7576.079
and hey failure can yield a lot of

7574.82 --> 7578.9
learning

7576.079 --> 7580.639
in general so it's not really it doesn't

7578.9 --> 7585.28
really matter it's just that it's not

7580.639 --> 7585.28
the antecedent for Success you see of

7589.699 --> 7594.138999999999
redo saying the first attempt is yeah

7592.159 --> 7595.5199999999995
but even if the first attempt is a

7594.139 --> 7599.2390000000005
success

7595.52 --> 7602.2390000000005
then you should still try again

7599.239 --> 7603.619
see if it's going to be success again

7602.239 --> 7606.079
right

7603.619 --> 7609.619
repetition

7606.079 --> 7612.139
is really the biggest factor with

7609.619 --> 7614.9
empiricism to not just try something

7612.139 --> 7615.86
once but to keep trying it and see if it

7614.9 --> 7618.879999999999
keeps

7615.86 --> 7618.88
staying the same

7619.4 --> 7623.0
to make sure if you get everything all

7621.26 --> 7625.52
right

7623.0 --> 7627.739
and then if something different happens

7625.52 --> 7629.360000000001
why did it happen differently is it

7627.739 --> 7632.119
because you

7629.36 --> 7635.42
oversaw that might be a little change

7632.119 --> 7638.119
that you did overlooked right of what

7635.42 --> 7641.599
you did with the setup right that's all

7638.119 --> 7644.96
about it that it's about the repetition

7641.599 --> 7646.52
that's when it really becomes clear as

7644.96 --> 7648.44
to how it works

7646.52 --> 7651.38
you don't necessarily have to fail for

7648.44 --> 7653.78
that but failure will always yield

7651.38 --> 7656.56
learning

7653.78 --> 7656.5599999999995
regardless

7695.3 --> 7701.659000000001
it will be the biggest challenge

7698.3 --> 7704.0
Well yeah if we are surrounded by people

7701.659 --> 7706.579
that are literally destroying their own

7704.0 --> 7709.46
ability and that are palpably becoming

7706.579 --> 7711.679
more [ __ ] culturally culturally

7709.46 --> 7714.5
regenerated then your ego will

7711.679 --> 7717.139
absolutely challenge you

7714.5 --> 7719.84
because you're gonna feel like I'm

7717.139 --> 7721.76
better than them or if you then keep

7719.84 --> 7725.2390000000005
acting onto that

7721.76 --> 7728.179
and actually deprive them of a human

7725.239 --> 7730.638999999999
nature Underneath It All

7728.179 --> 7732.5
start to treat them like they are like

7730.639 --> 7735.26
cattle literally and they're not human

7732.5 --> 7737.239
Underneath It All that's when it becomes

7735.26 --> 7740.9800000000005
problematic because that's where you

7737.239 --> 7740.98
literally engage in sin

7741.739 --> 7747.259999999999
whether you realize it or not

7744.26 --> 7749.96
doesn't mean that you can't treat dumb

7747.26 --> 7752.599
people like dumb people but if you think

7749.96 --> 7755.3
that they're not really human anymore

7752.599 --> 7756.8
and that they just deserve to perish and

7755.3 --> 7760.820000000001
you don't care

7756.8 --> 7763.099
then that's like one step too far

7760.82 --> 7766.159
should realize that all deranged people

7763.099 --> 7769.400000000001
in effectively have become the range

7766.159 --> 7771.92
because of two factors one their choice

7769.4 --> 7775.46
which might be led by fear or weakness

7771.92 --> 7779.36
resulting in not progressing

7775.46 --> 7782.2390000000005
the other part is that because the world

7779.36 --> 7786.079
is like that has been made like that

7782.239 --> 7788.54
if the world hadn't been made like that

7786.079 --> 7790.34
to constantly seduce you to become

7788.54 --> 7792.8
stupid

7790.34 --> 7794.599
then it's very likely that those people

7792.8 --> 7795.92
wouldn't

7794.599 --> 7798.079
have

7795.92 --> 7798.9800000000005
failed in their choices and become

7798.079 --> 7800.9
stupid

7798.98 --> 7802.759999999999
they might still have their faculties

7800.9 --> 7805.098999999999
because it hadn't been taken from them

7802.76 --> 7808.639
because they hadn't been forced into a

7805.099 --> 7811.2390000000005
choice and then failed you see

7808.639 --> 7813.92
you have to realize that above all

7811.239 --> 7815.839999999999
there's the choice of the person and the

7813.92 --> 7817.6990000000005
choice might be weak but it's also

7815.84 --> 7820.400000000001
because of the conditions of the world

7817.699 --> 7822.44
that they were kind of forced into that

7820.4 --> 7824.839999999999
you got to be honest about it not just

7822.44 --> 7827.48
say oh there were always going to perish

7824.84 --> 7830.4800000000005
no they yeah they might always gonna

7827.48 --> 7833.299999999999
perish because of the conditions

7830.48 --> 7835.699
but it's the conditions it's not like if

7833.3 --> 7838.34
they were if you would just leave them

7835.699 --> 7840.739
right leave them alone not force all

7838.34 --> 7845.06
this [ __ ] top down in psychological and

7840.739 --> 7847.159
through media then you have no lead

7845.06 --> 7850.579000000001
to conclude that they would have always

7847.159 --> 7854.138999999999
ended up as deranged as that you see

7850.579 --> 7856.88
only then when you realize that can you

7854.139 --> 7861.34
truly be fair

7856.88 --> 7861.34
in dealing with others in this situation

7868.219 --> 7871.84
I hope you guys are following me

7872.3 --> 7878.719
I think I'm gonna run out to show though

7874.099 --> 7882.639
and going for over two hours 10 minutes

7878.719 --> 7882.639

7894.26 --> 7898.179
giving you the link to my show there

7899.84 --> 7903.860000000001
or at least

7901.52 --> 7906.1990000000005
yeah told you to look up my channel I

7903.86 --> 7908.119
don't have a wrench over gymbox I

7906.199 --> 7909.5
remember so it's good to see you in my

7908.119 --> 7912.098999999999
chat live

7909.5 --> 7912.099
welcome

7930.92 --> 7934.52
anyway

7932.3 --> 7938.4800000000005
I am rounding out

7934.52 --> 7941.06
so thanks everyone for coming I hope you

7938.48 --> 7943.28
like this show it's been my first show

7941.06 --> 7945.139
back on YouTube

7943.28 --> 7947.239
for a week

7945.139 --> 7949.400000000001
I'm back

7947.239 --> 7951.799999999999
it went really well I thought I thought

7949.4 --> 7953.78
there was a great show very fluid lots

7951.8 --> 7955.46
of conversations I was able to get a

7953.78 --> 7958.5199999999995
grip pretty well

7955.46 --> 7960.679
hope my explanations were sufficient

7958.52 --> 7963.679
and clear enough sometimes I noticed

7960.679 --> 7965.659
that I'm so into it that I kind of

7963.679 --> 7967.76
almost skipped details in my

7965.659 --> 7970.219
explanations and then if you're not

7967.76 --> 7972.8
super tuned in you kind of miss out

7970.219 --> 7974.54
so I'm gonna try to pay more attention

7972.8 --> 7976.6990000000005
to always make sure that the

7974.54 --> 7978.679
explanations are fully rolled out when I

7976.699 --> 7981.44
address something otherwise you just

7978.679 --> 7983.119
might lose track of what I'm actually

7981.44 --> 7983.96
talking about and I don't want that to

7983.119 --> 7987.139
happen

7983.96 --> 7991.099
that would be sloppy of me right

7987.139 --> 7994.579
anyway if you like this show then please

7991.099 --> 7996.5
don't forget to rogans it up and if you

7994.579 --> 7998.599
haven't already subscribe to my channel

7996.5 --> 8000.34

8013.06 --> 8018.88

8015.82 --> 8022.299999999999
PayPal that would be great it'll keep

8018.88 --> 8024.88
the local Arwin fed here and keep my

8022.3 --> 8026.92
mind of financial stress and all that

8024.88 --> 8030.76
which just gets in the way of my quality

8026.92 --> 8032.8
