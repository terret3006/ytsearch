84.71 --> 96.88999999999999

like the real summer part is pretty much

96.89 --> 104.45
over that's what it feels like

98.63 --> 107.38
oh well it's been a great summer so yeah

104.45 --> 107.38000000000001
let's see was in chat

112.1 --> 122.86999999999999

to yesterday was quite a blast I don't

142.19 --> 154.01
know if she kept track of the year of

146.03 --> 156.95
the globe no globe tour thumb I was yeah

154.01 --> 158.92999999999998
I was pretty much following it up to the

156.95 --> 160.92999999999998
end and I think yeah I was part of the

158.93 --> 163.76000000000002
last hangout as well was great

160.93 --> 168.14000000000001
good cuz Skype conversation with four

163.76 --> 172.54
people including Martin Lathika and was

168.14 --> 177.70899999999997
great fun at a blast I was kind of drunk

172.54 --> 182.51
not really bad I hope what it was just a

177.709 --> 186.32
lot of fun and after that waited for a

182.51 --> 188.57
bit and then Jerry nism started but then

186.32 --> 190.76
I thought yeah man I've had such a heavy

188.57 --> 194.81
day I kind of need to take a rest and

190.76 --> 196.519
then I woke up at 3 o'clock at night

194.81 --> 200.959
it's like oh [ __ ]

196.519 --> 202.97
I guess I really need an arrest so then

200.959 --> 207.23
yeah my night was a bit weird because of

202.97 --> 215.65
that a yellow Ragnar Stefan Alderson and

207.23 --> 215.64999999999998
flat side the mind of many okay

227.689 --> 234.75
so yeah have you guys follow followed

230.9 --> 235.59
hmm and the rest of the shows it's

234.75 --> 237.989
pretty interesting

235.59 --> 240.84
I got Tamera coffee by the way and tea I

237.989 --> 245.18
had an Illuminati cause some before this

240.84 --> 247.56
but again I try to try to save it but

245.18 --> 252.54000000000002
waiting half an hour and that was just

247.56 --> 254.849
too much I can't seem to keep the

252.54 --> 257.699
Illuminati croissants away from my mouth

254.849 --> 263.15999999999997
long enough for them to eat them on the

257.699 --> 265.229
show anymore unless I arrive like five

263.16 --> 268.53000000000003
minutes before and the weird thing is

265.229 --> 272.55
today I kind of tried that because when

268.53 --> 274.73999999999995
it was 15 past 1:00 I thought yeah I'm

272.55 --> 278.039
gonna get some groceries stuff right now

274.74 --> 278.82
and then I'll just be just in time for

278.039 --> 282.65
the show

278.82 --> 285.63
but I did it so quickly that I got back

282.65 --> 290.15999999999997
with half an hour to spare was I can't

285.63 --> 293.13
believe I managed that but I don't know

290.16 --> 295.11
I've been on just some slight our weenie

293.13 --> 299.13
in detail and it's not really that

295.11 --> 301.32
interesting what I I don't know I give

299.13 --> 305.96999999999997
it two and three days ago I had like a

301.32 --> 307.71
really heavy sort of like a muscle ache

305.97 --> 310.09900000000005
and I couldn't really place where it was

307.71 --> 313.43
coming from why my muscles were so tired

310.099 --> 318.12
hadn't done anything out of the ordinary

313.43 --> 319.889
but yesterday that kind of changed I

318.12 --> 323.58
don't know what it was but suddenly I

319.889 --> 325.65000000000003
got it was released and every time I got

323.58 --> 328.08
on the bicycle and even today I'm just

325.65 --> 331.82
sprinting half of the time because I'm

328.08 --> 334.56
just enjoying it so much and really have

331.82 --> 338.0
want to feel like flexing everything and

334.56 --> 339.99
just putting in some strength and yeah

338.0 --> 343.889
it's weird how that just suddenly

339.99 --> 345.28000000000003
changes but then again I think that I

343.889 --> 347.889
may have been

345.28 --> 352.98999999999995
[Music]

347.889 --> 358.22
SiC I guess without having real serious

352.99 --> 360.95
symptoms it is you know most people I

358.22 --> 364.99
guess have typical jobs and everything

360.95 --> 367.669
exposure to a lot of social situations

364.99 --> 370.13
they eventually then get sick and then

367.669 --> 372.32
they just kind of break down and start

370.13 --> 374.78
coughing and all that [ __ ] and they

372.32 --> 376.82
maybe even get a fever and that's the

374.78 --> 380.63
way they get sick well I don't really

376.82 --> 383.87
get sick like that at all anymore but it

380.63 --> 385.82
seems that sometimes there is still some

383.87 --> 389.63
things that need to be cleaned up so

385.82 --> 391.90999999999997
it's like I'm a little sick there's some

389.63 --> 393.35
metabolic processes that are being

391.91 --> 396.71000000000004
initiated and it's kind of mysterious

393.35 --> 398.84000000000003
because it's like okay if you kind of

396.71 --> 402.56
sick but I'm not really sick what's

398.84 --> 405.28999999999996
going on and then it's just I just take

402.56 --> 410.39
it as okay I'm not feeling super great

405.29 --> 414.68
for a few days right but I don't really

410.39 --> 418.39
get sick at all I haven't been like

414.68 --> 418.39
seriously sick in a long time

421.4 --> 424.59999999999997
[Music]

439.349 --> 444.919
oh yeah caffeine late at night is not

442.139 --> 448.499
handy it's not good for you

444.919 --> 455.06899999999996
although weirdly enough you can actually

448.499 --> 457.28900000000004
use coffee to get to sleep it's weird

455.069 --> 460.16900000000004
like when you're really tired and you do

457.289 --> 461.639
drink coffee you do but it can't if you

460.169 --> 465.389
put sugar in it then it actually

461.639 --> 468.629
backfires badly but you can drink like

465.389 --> 471.569
pure coffee when you're really tired and

468.629 --> 477.719
then it will actually enhance the

471.569 --> 481.319
tiredness but it's not the best way to

477.719 --> 485.24899999999997
go about trying to get to sleep because

481.319 --> 487.91900000000004
yeah you people typically condition

485.249 --> 489.629
themselves to associate coffee just

487.919 --> 492.889
mentally with waking up so it's not

489.629 --> 496.309
really gonna work out all that well

492.889 --> 496.309
probably if you tried

498.82 --> 503.02
I had I think it's a trick that I

501.07 --> 508.62
learned from my grandmother weirdly

503.02 --> 510.60999999999996
enough she said that I don't know it's

508.62 --> 513.46
from a long time ago

510.61 --> 515.35
I don't really tried I barely drink any

513.46 --> 526.87
coffee anymore you know two cups of

515.35 --> 532.96
coffee and that's just enough no I'm

526.87 --> 535.35
back a gem a matrix media also good to

532.96 --> 535.35
see you

549.64 --> 555.17
so yeah still waiting for any feedback

552.47 --> 560.57
from yesterday I thought it was a really

555.17 --> 569.92
fun and well going episode hello ace

560.57 --> 569.9200000000001
MacLeod the one it's nice and fluid and

570.46 --> 579.26
Adam has Adam ikan has been helping out

573.62 --> 583.63
like throughout old throughout all the

579.26 --> 586.34
the whole train for the tour tone and

583.63 --> 588.38
that this video is made and everything

586.34 --> 594.35
and it was just fun a lot of fun

588.38 --> 596.84
yesterday I wonder how far they will get

594.35 --> 600.08
them I kind of when I saw the whole map

596.84 --> 603.26
thing it is it was kind of like Oh for

600.08 --> 609.3100000000001
real it's like a huge project it seemed

603.26 --> 612.62
like the over sized version like for

609.31 --> 616.3699999999999
like the maximum possible options as

612.62 --> 618.74
well and I want to yeah they might need

616.37 --> 620.8100000000001
to size it down a little but who knows

618.74 --> 624.02
they'll just we'll see where they're

620.81 --> 626.0
gonna go I think they discussed it

624.02 --> 630.29
already that right I have to size it

626.0 --> 633.02
down a little but I'm pretty confident

630.29 --> 635.3299999999999
they'll at least get to Amsterdam that

633.02 --> 638.4689999999999
would be very cool

635.33 --> 638.469
[Music]

665.35 --> 675.4200000000001
all right well let earth fantasy you can

669.49 --> 675.42
stick to whatever imagination you like

677.79 --> 683.05
because I'm pretty sure that's just

680.32 --> 685.3000000000001
plenty of proof or rather there's no

683.05 --> 688.27
proof that you are on that ball you can

685.3 --> 691.54
of course fantasize sticking to it your

688.27 --> 693.55
imagination yeah

691.54 --> 697.36
even though flat-earthers in general

693.55 --> 701.76
don't uniformly have a model a

697.36 --> 704.77
confirmable model in any sense that

701.76 --> 709.24
doesn't mean that we don't have a lot of

704.77 --> 713.43
this proof for the ball by basically

709.24 --> 715.75
overturning all these standard

713.43 --> 717.76
assumption based foundations that have

715.75 --> 719.89
been conditioned into everyone the first

717.76 --> 720.85
approach of everyone when you start to

719.89 --> 723.46
question the ball

720.85 --> 726.22
what about boats going over the horizon

723.46 --> 729.6700000000001
what about the star rotations but all

726.22 --> 732.88
that all the the preliminary responses

729.67 --> 738.4
and we've overturned each and every one

732.88 --> 739.99
of them persistently and that's what's

738.4 --> 740.3199999999999
the Flat Earth debates has been all

739.99 --> 744.63
about

740.32 --> 747.4300000000001
that's the it's prime focus so yeah

744.63 --> 752.86
sorry about the lack of Flat Earth

747.43 --> 755.1099999999999
evidence okay silly but yeah you're the

752.86 --> 760.24
one that's actually gonna trust to a

755.11 --> 762.25
fantasy for which there is just a lot of

760.24 --> 766.26
counter evidence so it's not even a lack

762.25 --> 766.26
of evidence it's just counter evidence

769.53 --> 779.28
we fished out the machinations and

772.08 --> 782.2800000000001
machinations are constructed lies known

779.28 --> 784.74
to be lies constructed to fool into

782.28 --> 787.56
believing a certain thing machinations

784.74 --> 789.96
and the end the globe model and all

787.56 --> 791.42
these systems that prove it's a globe

789.96 --> 794.52
are full of them

791.42 --> 803.9
totally riddled it's the very foundation

794.52 --> 803.9
of the entire thing good luck with that

808.42 --> 811.52
[Music]

817.04 --> 819.73
all right

820.47 --> 827.6
well you go playing anchor and peanuts

824.82 --> 827.6
Clark - what are we

832.259 --> 835.22
yeah

836.519 --> 842.68
okay flatter fancy you can stop spamming

839.829 --> 845.319
now or I'm gonna time you laugh because

842.68 --> 846.9989999999999
yeah you're filling up half the chat and

845.319 --> 849.449
you're not saying a lot you're just

846.999 --> 849.4490000000001
being annoying

850.019 --> 857.35
so I refuse to outright assume you were

855.309 --> 861.279
going to be a troll but if you keep on

857.35 --> 867.91
going like this I will treat you as one

861.279 --> 869.98
so yeah I can't help that your fantasy

867.91 --> 872.529
makes so much more sense to you despite

869.98 --> 875.91
all the arguments we just drew a throw

872.529 --> 881.23
at you yeah

875.91 --> 884.41
good bye Kevin now I'll just skip

881.23 --> 888.779
straight to the end because when you

884.41 --> 888.779
threw out that kind of shitty remark

891.569 --> 897.87
that's yeah just to show you right there

908.0 --> 915.949
yeah it's really annoying by the way

910.579 --> 918.199
when new people get in and they feel

915.949 --> 922.1289999999999
like a troll they act like a troll but

918.199 --> 924.29
you gotta give him a chance because they

922.129 --> 926.9300000000001
might just turn out to be a kind of

924.29 --> 931.189
deluded general person acting like a

926.93 --> 942.189
troll but unfortunately most of the time

931.189 --> 942.189
it's just a freakin troll what is that

945.45 --> 957.59
who did you hide I didn't even see that

947.88 --> 964.37
one a CC hashtag F four six seven six

957.59 --> 964.37
where's that what did you do

975.69 --> 978.32
weird

980.49 --> 986.49
well it didn't even register I didn't

983.34 --> 988.32
see any kind of notification that that

986.49 --> 990.45
account was there so I wonder how you

988.32 --> 1007.19
managed to block that if I can't even

990.45 --> 1009.32
see it hey let's see you right yeah I

1007.19 --> 1015.2600000000001
did it would have been cool to have you

1009.32 --> 1017.5100000000001
over but hey I had I had Jason on Jason

1015.26 --> 1021.74
des burry for most of the Hangout so

1017.51 --> 1024.1
yeah it was a good one I thought so at

1021.74 --> 1024.1
least

1041.51 --> 1049.02
right yeah hey about that Dave Johnson a

1046.279 --> 1052.049
lot of people may have questions about

1049.02 --> 1055.799
what I think and they want me to expand

1052.049 --> 1057.929
upon my thoughts and I I do that if you

1055.799 --> 1060.0
might have noticed that I I try to do

1057.929 --> 1063.8400000000001
that even with simple questions and I

1060.0 --> 1066.63
expand upon it as far as possible as as

1063.84 --> 1070.02
far as sensible but then when you get

1066.63 --> 1072.96
things all these is gamma remarks like

1070.02 --> 1076.049
are you afraid are you afraid of what

1072.96 --> 1078.059
anything then you know it's that

1076.049 --> 1081.48
person's not here to learn anything he's

1078.059 --> 1084.75
just there to be really shitty and waste

1081.48 --> 1086.76
my time just like this guy who I don't

1084.75 --> 1091.61
even have to read because I know exactly

1086.76 --> 1091.61
who that is and yeah

1093.91 --> 1102.16
ah hey thanks Chris Trish Blythe for the

1098.61 --> 1105.4599999999998

1107.68 --> 1112.1100000000001
wrenches for handing out wrenches so far

1112.47 --> 1120.8500000000001
although I did give some people wrenches

1118.66 --> 1132.0900000000001

still not friends I don't see how that

1348.429 --> 1353.289
could work and just say bluntly stop

1352.119 --> 1355.149
being a dick and I'll stop being a dick

1353.289 --> 1357.759
back and then you be fine now but he's

1355.149 --> 1359.049
not going to be well he's just trying to

1357.759 --> 1362.259
build this channel isn't in he's using

1359.049 --> 1364.989
you as a as a contentious point yeah as

1362.259 --> 1367.299
a pedestal yeah yeah yeah yeah well I

1364.989 --> 1369.429
don't like to be used as pedestals I

1367.299 --> 1372.759
know it's a compliment though isn't it

1369.429 --> 1377.3490000000002
really I don't consider it as one I just

1372.759 --> 1382.029
consider it as a betrayal I know I can

1377.349 --> 1383.049
see your point to you what he's just

1382.029 --> 1384.399
trying to grow his channel is mean

1383.049 --> 1387.039
you're on the receiving end of it right

1384.399 --> 1389.4689999999998
and he's doing it into in predatory

1387.039 --> 1392.579
fashion and I don't like that I wouldn't

1389.469 --> 1396.519
do that I like to build up people like

1392.579 --> 1398.709
to help mock not start throwing out

1396.519 --> 1404.429
trolling and getting disruptive with

1398.709 --> 1405.549
people for no good reason it's just no

1404.429 --> 1408.8200000000002
sorry

1405.549 --> 1414.219
yeah yeah all right he doesn't need to

1408.82 --> 1415.539
do that to do it anyway he feels he's

1414.219 --> 1417.759
got this thing going on where he wants

1415.539 --> 1419.139
to be he liked Issa and he wanted to be

1417.759 --> 1421.179
friends with everybody on the ball that

1419.139 --> 1423.0089999999998
side and their terrorist sympathizer

1421.179 --> 1425.019
that's that's the risk that he's

1423.009 --> 1428.289
gambling he's gonna be seen as being a

1425.019 --> 1431.2
terrorist sympathizer well it's

1428.289 --> 1433.749
ridiculous why would he why would anyone

1431.2 --> 1437.559
do that at this point when you can do

1433.749 --> 1442.239
exactly what I do and just try to build

1437.559 --> 1444.339
a mutual respectful understanding right

1442.239 --> 1446.799
that's what I do I got ballers in my

1444.339 --> 1448.749
chat I I think you get on Jose's and

1446.799 --> 1451.089
have civil conversations sometimes you

1448.749 --> 1452.769
know to be honest I think he aspires to

1451.089 --> 1454.6589999999999
be Nathan or awesome you know if

1452.769 --> 1458.369
somebody can earn a living on

1454.659 --> 1464.1290000000001
Internet I think that's his aspiration

1458.369 --> 1468.369
why he has yes he's drowning in money

1464.129 --> 1469.9289999999999
seriously who wanted yeah look whatever

1468.369 --> 1472.599
everything that got dumped on his

1469.929 --> 1476.679
channel just recently a nanny has a

1472.599 --> 1478.989
great job work for the rest of his life

1476.679 --> 1482.169
if he wants to why would he want to do

1478.989 --> 1484.72
this look easiest comments and choices

1482.169 --> 1486.789
remember when Ramsey hated that I hang I

1484.72 --> 1489.609
hang with borders ie the rest of the

1486.789 --> 1491.259
world oh yeah there was a time when

1489.609 --> 1493.09
Ramsey said burn everybody off his

1491.259 --> 1494.47
channel on site he's fun more people on

1493.09 --> 1496.269
this site than any and now he wants them

1494.47 --> 1497.529
to be friends he's just trying to build

1496.269 --> 1500.889
this channel he doesn't want to admit it

1497.529 --> 1503.47
that's what it is all right well I'd

1500.889 --> 1505.809
like to build my channel also but I'm

1503.47 --> 1507.8790000000001
not gonna build it on a muddy foundation

1505.809 --> 1511.599
I'm not gonna build on a swamp so I'm

1507.879 --> 1514.1789999999999
just gonna route the trolls and yeah

1511.599 --> 1517.45
keep on weeding the garden until there's

1514.179 --> 1520.659
just a lot of nice people in there

1517.45 --> 1524.229
instead of just trolls pushing stuff

1520.659 --> 1527.5900000000001
away and I don't need any proof of

1524.229 --> 1530.1390000000001
legitimacy by the level of trolling I

1527.59 --> 1531.22
get you know that's kind of a thing in

1530.139 --> 1533.859
the debates

1531.22 --> 1536.8890000000001
Nathan started that like okay just

1533.859 --> 1539.32
letting the chat show how sick these

1536.889 --> 1542.59
people really are and from his

1539.32 --> 1545.32
perspective that really works I don't

1542.59 --> 1548.799
need to do that that's not what I'm

1545.32 --> 1556.349
trying to achieve here I'm trying to and

1548.799 --> 1562.84
achieve a room of trust and learning and

1556.349 --> 1565.149
you see just enlightenment general in

1562.84 --> 1567.4889999999998
general that's what I'm trying and these

1565.149 --> 1571.2389999999998
trolls do exactly the opposite there's

1567.489 --> 1574.419
no way I'll get them on my side it's no

1571.239 --> 1577.239
way and they keep on trying harder and

1574.419 --> 1579.5800000000002
harder I'm really surprised with the

1577.239 --> 1582.6390000000001
level of stalking that some of these

1579.58 --> 1584.769
trolls go through on a daily basis and

1582.639 --> 1586.4599999999998
it seems here on my channel more than

1584.769 --> 1589.669
anywhere else come

1586.46 --> 1592.309
- the amount of subscribers I have it's

1589.669 --> 1594.499
just ridiculous and every time I go on

1592.309 --> 1598.1589999999999
some other channel on Nathan's or on

1594.499 --> 1601.279
Jose's and it just even say something or

1598.159 --> 1604.8690000000001
type a word it's it's 15 minutes of

1601.279 --> 1607.429
troll spam shouting my name it's insane

1604.869 --> 1608.6
just keeps on going yeah by the way

1607.429 --> 1611.69
thanks again

1608.6 --> 1615.6789999999999
Trish Blythe for the 1499 Australian

1611.69 --> 1618.3790000000001
super chat donation you will build it

1615.679 --> 1621.6490000000001
Arwen stay true to yourself thank you

1618.379 --> 1625.789
thank you III will I will do my best I

1621.649 --> 1627.59
will stay true to myself because what

1625.789 --> 1630.71
else do I have left if I don't

1627.59 --> 1632.749
it's what I'm trying to do shout outs a

1630.71 --> 1635.3600000000001
face or face I'm not sure he pronounced

1632.749 --> 1637.369
it he says Bronte like Riley has been

1635.36 --> 1640.07
fully compromised and he did admit to

1637.369 --> 1641.4189999999999
that I'm not sure winces and he and he

1640.07 --> 1644.1789999999999
did admit to that I'm not sure if he's

1641.419 --> 1646.789
admitting to me or runty how have you

1644.179 --> 1648.1390000000001
been compromised I have no idea I'd love

1646.789 --> 1653.45
to know where he gets that perception

1648.139 --> 1656.299
from hmm if you could elaborate a little

1653.45 --> 1659.8300000000002
bit faith on who you think admitted it

1656.299 --> 1662.119
and why you think that I was compromised

1659.83 --> 1664.369
it might be true it might be remembering

1662.119 --> 1665.72
somewhere historic well I'm just

1664.369 --> 1669.6789999999999
interested to know his perception of

1665.72 --> 1675.679
what he's referring to now I don't know

1669.679 --> 1677.8890000000001
face is kind of a he is like a bad troll

1675.679 --> 1680.3300000000002
he's been being really annoying I

1677.889 --> 1685.0089999999998
blocked him a some time ago and I

1680.33 --> 1688.249
unblocked him and just immediately he's

1685.009 --> 1692.119
just trolling again the phase is a

1688.249 --> 1696.289
person I'm pretty pretty certain 100%

1692.119 --> 1701.869
that he has no life or a very miserable

1696.289 --> 1704.72
one anyway yeah you know I've had my own

1701.869 --> 1707.389
run-ins with ranty in the past even here

1704.72 --> 1710.33
on my own channel and I spoke out my

1707.389 --> 1713.269
concerns at the time and these type of

1710.33 --> 1718.07
issues keep on building so there is in

1713.269 --> 1720.169
my opinion II makes decision without

1718.07 --> 1724.789
yeah without basing

1720.169 --> 1726.95
without having a sensible system to

1724.789 --> 1730.399
conduct these decisions that he's making

1726.95 --> 1732.5900000000001
so he's he's wild grow thing and that's

1730.399 --> 1734.7199999999998
not healthy and that's just a personal

1732.59 --> 1736.82
decision and he of course thinks it's

1734.72 --> 1739.519
ridiculous for somebody like me to say

1736.82 --> 1741.529
that who is such a slow-growth that I'm

1739.519 --> 1744.889
just visibly not accomplishing a lot

1741.529 --> 1748.249
except for getting known and talking

1744.889 --> 1751.07
better-quality but he's just like yeah

1748.249 --> 1753.019
he's making money using that and that's

1751.07 --> 1755.6
why I think he's trusting to be like

1753.019 --> 1756.98
that oh thank you by the way Amanda

1755.6 --> 1759.049
young for the five dollar super chair

1756.98 --> 1761.21
donation good morning our we'll keep up

1759.049 --> 1761.899
the great work thank you thank you for

1761.21 --> 1764.1190000000001
your support

1761.899 --> 1766.2489999999998
super curve actually brings up a valid

1764.119 --> 1768.529
point he says Arwen so this is all for

1766.249 --> 1770.179
money then it's all just an act question

1768.529 --> 1772.999
mark that means that you can't change

1770.179 --> 1776.239
your minds that works both ways how all

1772.999 --> 1777.6490000000001
this works both ways I mean let's be

1776.239 --> 1779.1490000000001
honest all of the ballers are all

1777.649 --> 1780.859
monetized right and they're all riding

1779.149 --> 1783.379
the wave that is but the bias and

1780.859 --> 1785.48
promotion of ballers and the baller

1783.379 --> 1787.07
trolls as well and they're all riding

1785.48 --> 1788.809
that wave so they're clearly never gonna

1787.07 --> 1790.879
change the mind are they and we all know

1788.809 --> 1793.369
that gravity or curvature axial rotation

1790.879 --> 1795.98
evidence doesn't exist so it works both

1793.369 --> 1798.47
ways super good right oh and Fyodor

1795.98 --> 1799.94
Dostoevsky is one of my favorite ballers

1798.47 --> 1801.8890000000001
in chat that's why I gave him a wrench

1799.94 --> 1805.22
because he eat ask smart questions

1801.889 --> 1809.809
sometimes our day terms Owen Benjamin

1805.22 --> 1813.049
uses fast growth slow growth no no that

1809.809 --> 1815.4189999999999
was literally the description I'm giving

1813.049 --> 1818.049
it you know I do adapt some of his

1815.419 --> 1820.429
terminologies because they are really

1818.049 --> 1822.59
hitting the right snare hitting the

1820.429 --> 1825.259
right frequency often and a lot of

1822.59 --> 1828.139
people are taking it I'm noticing it

1825.259 --> 1829.7
from a lot of people are taking notice

1828.139 --> 1833.33
of met Owen Benjamin in the flat earth

1829.7 --> 1836.3890000000001
and are kind of copying certain words

1833.33 --> 1838.519
and that's good because they're good

1836.389 --> 1841.4289999999999
words that with a good understanding oh

1838.519 --> 1847.269
and Benjamin explains things very deeply

1841.429 --> 1847.269
and I appreciate his contributions

1848.38 --> 1858.19
and I love it when he starts hammering

1850.99 --> 1860.41
on the moon issue rightly so peanuts

1858.19 --> 1864.22
Clark says Anthony wise Nathan's panel

1860.41 --> 1866.6200000000001
so afraid of new information I don't

1864.22 --> 1868.299
know why you get that perception but

1866.62 --> 1870.25
it's not new information that they're

1868.299 --> 1871.84
seeking it's new evidence

1870.25 --> 1874.57
the problem with information is

1871.84 --> 1876.34
informations got to be computed so if

1874.57 --> 1877.6599999999999
there's new information out there let's

1876.34 --> 1879.37
not have the information let's have the

1877.66 --> 1881.65
evidence that allowed the information to

1879.37 --> 1884.4089999999999
exist so that we can discuss that

1881.65 --> 1886.99
evidence because information is is the

1884.409 --> 1890.98
consequence of evidence so I don't think

1886.99 --> 1893.35
that information is afraid of being

1890.98 --> 1895.03
considered by anyone's panel but I

1893.35 --> 1897.4189999999999
haven't seen any credible information

1895.03 --> 1899.799
coming from the bolas and if there is

1897.419 --> 1901.75
that I don't think Nathan's panel is

1899.799 --> 1908.049
afraid of it at all peanuts from honest

1901.75 --> 1912.309
I just I just look at what is happening

1908.049 --> 1915.039
every time it's very simple if there are

1912.309 --> 1918.27
questions being asked are they getting

1915.039 --> 1920.71
answers especially yes/no questions or

1918.27 --> 1923.9089999999999
are they getting red herrings and then

1920.71 --> 1925.33
you know where things are at and

1923.909 --> 1928.2700000000002
flat-earthers

1925.33 --> 1930.6999999999998
we answer questions pretty directly

1928.27 --> 1933.6399999999999
every time we can I especially love it

1930.7 --> 1936.07
when like for example rumpus tries to

1933.64 --> 1939.3700000000001
put some elaborate thing like on a

1936.07 --> 1941.62
careful scale on the edge trice and what

1939.37 --> 1944.4699999999998
do you think yes or no like I couldn't

1941.62 --> 1947.62
say yes and I just say yes because I

1944.47 --> 1950.679
already know it's a trap what else oh no

1947.62 --> 1955.6
just I have more grip on the issue so I

1950.679 --> 1956.289
just say yes and just just answer the

1955.6 --> 1958.99
question

1956.289 --> 1961.48
just answer the question stop with the

1958.99 --> 1963.28
red herrings that's it and that's so

1961.48 --> 1965.74
funny with spur schema too because

1963.28 --> 1967.78
that's just how you know he's going the

1965.74 --> 1970.08
wrong direction because he can answer

1967.78 --> 1976.09
questions anymore

1970.08 --> 1977.6789999999999
please turn into a Okemo rumpus yeah so

1976.09 --> 1979.1789999999999
he's got a seat planted in somewhere and

1977.679 --> 1981.2800000000002
I don't really understand now anyway so

1979.179 --> 1983.14
from this card

1981.28 --> 1984.76
tempe says all of the ball this question

1983.14 --> 1988.51
mark you know we don't support ballers

1984.76 --> 1990.31
making money off off flat earth right no

1988.51 --> 1991.66
one should make money off this I agree

1990.31 --> 1992.8899999999999
no none of us should not none of the

1991.66 --> 1994.45
ballers should not on the fire thighs

1992.89 --> 1996.73
should because it should be a topic of

1994.45 --> 1998.26
interest right but at the end of the day

1996.73 --> 2000.57
there are people that do put a lot of

1998.26 --> 2002.91
time and money and effort into it on

2000.57 --> 2005.73
both sides and if they do do create if

2002.91 --> 2007.5
they do create content and media I mean

2005.73 --> 2010.2
let's be honest if Jaron didn't exist

2007.5 --> 2011.73
and globe boosters didn't exist most of

2010.2 --> 2013.1100000000001
us wouldn't exist because most of us

2011.73 --> 2015.75
have all got some kind of like

2013.11 --> 2018.12
Allegiance in some way towards people

2015.75 --> 2021.36
that create pro flatteners content is

2018.12 --> 2023.79
that I like to watch it see I'm gonna

2021.36 --> 2025.6499999999999
think I'll come back all right

2023.79 --> 2030.05
I don't know why but Nathan just went

2025.65 --> 2035.01
live think he's starting extra early

2030.05 --> 2045.96
weird well I'm just gonna keep on going

2035.01 --> 2049.59
for now anyway let's keep trying to get

2045.96 --> 2051.54
back to the subject yeah yeah so and

2049.59 --> 2052.77
then super keV says bolos would change

2051.54 --> 2055.62
their mind if you have evidence to

2052.77 --> 2057.54
support your claims but you do not super

2055.62 --> 2058.7999999999997
Cove is not a scientist and you do have

2057.54 --> 2061.23
new discoveries you need to discover

2058.8 --> 2065.94
gravity you know but hold on support for

2061.23 --> 2067.53
what claims yeah that's that's if they

2065.94 --> 2070.2000000000003
say that every time you care don't

2067.53 --> 2071.9700000000003
support for you what what claim we're

2070.2 --> 2074.7599999999998
not making the claims

2071.97 --> 2078.27
we're actually disclaiming things that's

2074.76 --> 2079.9500000000003
the prime direction the problem is I'll

2078.27 --> 2081.99
pick on Dawn Treader as it as an example

2079.95 --> 2083.4289999999996
recently um he came on with the

2081.99 --> 2086.49
perception that the star seemed to

2083.429 --> 2088.9500000000003
rotate in the opposing direction on the

2086.49 --> 2091.08
ball earth Wow as I explained on the on

2088.95 --> 2092.9089999999997
the flat plane and I'm like well me and

2091.08 --> 2094.95
chocolate tried to disseminate this into

2092.909 --> 2096.75
his basics chocolate said do you agree

2094.95 --> 2099.02
that all the stars rise due east and set

2096.75 --> 2102.27
G West and he said yes yeah then I said

2099.02 --> 2104.25
nice so that I said do you agree that

2102.27 --> 2106.38
when you look when you look in North in

2104.25 --> 2108.39
the north to look south in the South

2106.38 --> 2110.31
I've got to change your orientation and

2108.39 --> 2111.69
it's that change of orientation changes

2110.31 --> 2113.1
what you perceive is a change in

2111.69 --> 2114.75
direction but it's not actually a change

2113.1 --> 2115.14
in direction and he admitted it he said

2114.75 --> 2116.91
yeah

2115.14 --> 2118.5
and the naiton tried to point out that

2116.91 --> 2120.54
well you can I can't hold the same

2118.5 --> 2122.16
position is what you previously did

2120.54 --> 2123.81
which was that the stars don't go in the

2122.16 --> 2125.3399999999997
same direction on a flat plane because

2123.81 --> 2127.77
they do all the stars do the same thing

2125.34 --> 2129.78
and Dawn could not get his head round it

2127.77 --> 2131.46
or did get his head round it and just

2129.78 --> 2134.07
denied it anyway and pretended to be

2131.46 --> 2135.66
dumb but either way he's an example of

2134.07 --> 2137.1000000000004
where ballers will not change their mind

2135.66 --> 2139.3799999999997
if you have evidence to support our

2137.1 --> 2141.15
claims which other his perception wasn't

2139.38 --> 2143.28
fallacious and we demonstrated for why

2141.15 --> 2145.02
rather he didn't understand it or he did

2143.28 --> 2146.88
understand that it was plain dumb but

2145.02 --> 2148.38
that's an example where balls will not

2146.88 --> 2149.61
change their mind even when presented

2148.38 --> 2151.59
with the facts that are contrary to

2149.61 --> 2152.1
their position rompers I'll never change

2151.59 --> 2155.67
his mind

2152.1 --> 2160.14
ever right Oh indeed well he's there all

2155.67 --> 2161.61
the real ball debaters have been pushing

2160.14 --> 2164.0099999999998
against us they've all trained

2161.61 --> 2167.19
themselves to literally just not let

2164.01 --> 2171.1800000000003
that information arrive I'm pretty

2167.19 --> 2172.86
convinced that they try to claim like

2171.18 --> 2175.41
they don't know like the political

2172.86 --> 2177.54
decision like I don't know that even

2175.41 --> 2180.48
though you're telling it me right now I

2177.54 --> 2183.57
will not allow myself to let it

2180.48 --> 2186.03
cognitively sink in because it I know

2183.57 --> 2187.8900000000003
it's never gonna work out with what I'm

2186.03 --> 2190.65
trying to achieve here I think that is a

2187.89 --> 2193.3199999999997
wider tactic psychological tactic that

2190.65 --> 2194.4900000000002
they apply it's like an artificial

2193.32 --> 2197.67
ignorance

2194.49 --> 2199.6189999999997
I love Wiggles this question so what do

2197.67 --> 2201.81
flat earthers have left at this point to

2199.619 --> 2202.619
buck up their side Wiggles darling it's

2201.81 --> 2204.72
the other way around

2202.619 --> 2207.03
what do ball worth is up to back up

2204.72 --> 2209.64
their side you haven't demonstrated that

2207.03 --> 2212.0400000000004
you can even consistently define gravity

2209.64 --> 2213.359
let alone prove it you haven't got any

2212.04 --> 2215.609
evidence to prove that there's an axis

2213.359 --> 2217.38
of rotation on the earth only in the sky

2215.609 --> 2218.97
and you haven't got any evidence to

2217.38 --> 2221.73
prove demonstrable or measurable

2218.97 --> 2223.5
repeatable curvature anyway so what is

2221.73 --> 2224.85
it the ball earth has have left at this

2223.5 --> 2231.16
point to back up their side and the

2224.85 --> 2234.4
answer is pseudoscience yep

2231.16 --> 2240.97
mmm by the way maybe itza might join us

2234.4 --> 2245.11
let's see if he's there is he still here

2240.97 --> 2246.9399999999996
in chat because I stopped we go says we

2245.11 --> 2249.82
have star trails or focus pendant to

2246.94 --> 2251.92
show rotation rotation of watts

2249.82 --> 2253.75
you don't wiggle to us just a nonsense

2251.92 --> 2255.85
spurious claim that you know is

2253.75 --> 2259.12
fallacious it's a rotation of a disco

2255.85 --> 2263.38
ball that's what it's a rotation of its

2259.12 --> 2265.18
lights but why does what this is I have

2263.38 --> 2267.58
to go back to to back up this side

2265.18 --> 2269.5
honestly what Flyers have left to back

2267.58 --> 2272.02
up their side is pointing out that you

2269.5 --> 2274.99
guys are using pseudoscience to prove

2272.02 --> 2277.12
your claim and that is the problem we

2274.99 --> 2279.43
have no money no resources no equipment

2277.12 --> 2281.0499999999997
no machinery no no nothing to

2279.43 --> 2282.6099999999997
demonstrate that the earth fought well

2281.05 --> 2285.52
if you gave us the tools and the

2282.61 --> 2287.4700000000003
machinery and the equipment we could but

2285.52 --> 2288.7599999999998
we don't have that money so what do you

2287.47 --> 2290.98
expect us to be able to do you keep

2288.76 --> 2292.3
asking us for a model or a map how can

2290.98 --> 2294.73
we do that when we don't have any money

2292.3 --> 2296.32
or people we just point out that you

2294.73 --> 2297.91
guys can't prove your claims but all

2296.32 --> 2299.17
hold each other's willies as you tell

2297.91 --> 2304.24
everybody that you can prove everything

2299.17 --> 2307.75
can't can't prove any of it well you can

2304.24 --> 2311.08
prove the orientation of the of the land

2307.75 --> 2313.75
and even ocean bottom surface you can

2311.08 --> 2316.9
definitely just by putting rulers next

2313.75 --> 2318.85
to it effectively and then just show how

2316.9 --> 2321.52
it is divided whether that make any

2318.85 --> 2324.8199999999997
geometrical sense or not is another

2321.52 --> 2330.84
matter but you can definitely put the

2324.82 --> 2332.92
pieces of the land together and without

2330.84 --> 2336.9700000000003
reshaping things you know without

2332.92 --> 2340.75
scaling things back or up you know what

2336.97 --> 2342.4599999999996
they do with the projection map so that

2340.75 --> 2344.76
is something I think we need to do and

2342.46 --> 2348.9700000000003
get the total orientation of it all

2344.76 --> 2353.98
worked out like for example definitively

2348.97 --> 2357.52
work out is the equator ok the equator

2353.98 --> 2359.44
line as it is presumed and it is

2357.52 --> 2362.95
technically not a physical line it but

2359.44 --> 2364.59
it is like are the points at which the

2362.95 --> 2367.1699999999996
solar maximum

2364.59 --> 2368.7000000000003
is achieve how do you call it yeah the

2367.17 --> 2373.86
equator line is basically where the

2368.7 --> 2378.75
solar maximum is in the region if that

2373.86 --> 2379.29
line as yeah how that works if it is

2378.75 --> 2381.81
straight

2379.29 --> 2384.15
is it a straight line or is it a circle

2381.81 --> 2387.84
that is such an important question to

2384.15 --> 2389.25
answer and nobody's really dealt with it

2387.84 --> 2391.32
yet it's just been a bunch of

2389.25 --> 2393.24
back-and-forth claims with airplane

2391.32 --> 2396.77
travel times and that kind of nonsense

2393.24 --> 2399.5699999999997
and they clearly with some things are

2396.77 --> 2402.93
well playing hand at hand with weird

2399.57 --> 2406.26
scams so they're not the most reliable

2402.93 --> 2411.4199999999996
source to figure that one out in my

2406.26 --> 2413.6400000000003
opinion just then let's remind the ball

2411.42 --> 2415.35
is in chat now Marco lads message court

2413.64 --> 2418.3199999999997
case proved that they cannot prove its

2415.35 --> 2419.58
aglow so Zen Garcia for our challenge to

2418.32 --> 2421.8300000000004
any baller that could demonstrate

2419.58 --> 2424.08
recordable measurable repeatable

2421.83 --> 2425.4
curvature of the earth so I think I

2424.08 --> 2426.6
can't remember the value I think it may

2425.4 --> 2428.25
have been ten thousand dollars it might

2426.6 --> 2430.5
might not anybody put up a substantial

2428.25 --> 2432.78
amount of money ball earth who claimed

2430.5 --> 2434.76
it demonstrated why he was claiming it

2432.78 --> 2436.6800000000003
and saying Garcia said no you're not

2434.76 --> 2438.75
measuring the curvature you're measuring

2436.68 --> 2441.45
it based on deduced logic and that's not

2438.75 --> 2443.82
acceptable right and I should go

2441.45 --> 2445.2599999999998
presupposition yeah yeah ended up going

2443.82 --> 2447.0
to court because the other guy said that

2445.26 --> 2448.65
I'm entitled to the money and Zheng

2447.0 --> 2450.27
Garcia said you're measured curvature

2448.65 --> 2452.34
you've deduced it from calculations

2450.27 --> 2454.47
through a model and that's not measuring

2452.34 --> 2456.09
curvature and the judge agreed the judge

2454.47 --> 2458.04
said you haven't measured curvature

2456.09 --> 2460.3500000000004
you can't put money so whether it goes

2458.04 --> 2462.33
to appeal or not you know well that's if

2460.35 --> 2464.0099999999998
ball does can't demonstrate curvature

2462.33 --> 2465.99
then we could all make loads of money

2464.01 --> 2467.3700000000003
out of this and I think maybe we should

2465.99 --> 2469.7099999999996
consider doing exactly that by using

2467.37 --> 2471.54
Zheng Garcia as the benchmark to show

2469.71 --> 2472.83
that well if one guy couldn't measure it

2471.54 --> 2474.33
over this bridge that he was measuring

2472.83 --> 2475.44
then none of the non of these are going

2474.33 --> 2477.5099999999998
to be able to measure too much

2475.44 --> 2479.16
demonstrate measurable curvature which

2477.51 --> 2480.63
is our points you guys just think these

2479.16 --> 2481.95
are words these are not words we're

2480.63 --> 2483.6600000000003
trying to get you guys to demonstrate

2481.95 --> 2485.52
that you can prove there is curvature

2483.66 --> 2487.3799999999997
axial rotation gravity and we know you

2485.52 --> 2491.28
can't do you haven't defined gravity let

2487.38 --> 2494.19
alone demonstrates it thank you again

2491.28 --> 2497.07
for the Trish Blythe people said that

2494.19 --> 2500.01
it's pronounced life I don't know I

2497.07 --> 2501.6600000000003
my interpreters belief but thanks again

2500.01 --> 2504.9300000000003
for is it life

2501.66 --> 2506.1
yeah Blythe ad says Blythe okay fishbowl

2504.93 --> 2507.48
and the other the other thing is when

2506.1 --> 2509.43
you do two super chunks on channels that

2507.48 --> 2510.96
you watch and super chats are like walk

2509.43 --> 2512.19
them all in the sense that you just piss

2510.96 --> 2515.57
off all the ball is because they don't

2512.19 --> 2518.27
like money coming in right that's yeah

2515.57 --> 2521.6400000000003
well that's the fun thing about it

2518.27 --> 2523.29
unfortunately for me it's the least

2521.64 --> 2525.42
efficient yeah

2523.29 --> 2528.12
wait to receive contributions because

2525.42 --> 2530.16
it's officially registered and the

2528.12 --> 2532.56
social welfare it basically takes it all

2530.16 --> 2536.5499999999997
out again that's the only downside but

2532.56 --> 2542.52
it's for the visuals I like it and it's

2536.55 --> 2544.5600000000004
fine yeah but thanks again for the super

2542.52 --> 2547.38
chat donation and yeah thanks for the

2544.56 --> 2549.57
wrench well I think you you deserve it

2547.38 --> 2551.1
by now you've contributed so much and

2549.57 --> 2552.9900000000002
why not and it kind of could use an

2551.1 --> 2555.87
extra wrench right now I can't stall

2552.99 --> 2560.1299999999997
these trolls that just keep on sock

2555.87 --> 2561.8399999999997
spawning yeah you let trolls worry too

2560.13 --> 2563.79
much dude the way you should flip it the

2561.84 --> 2566.1600000000003
other way around I know on the 100's and

2563.79 --> 2567.69
say well like sense of the trolls on the

2566.16 --> 2569.67
other hand they make me feel more

2567.69 --> 2571.7400000000002
special than what I actually am I'm a

2569.67 --> 2574.02
normal glocal they make me feel special

2571.74 --> 2575.4599999999996
so I like link or anything just using

2574.02 --> 2577.05
all the outcomes because I just remind

2575.46 --> 2578.85
myself are much better than them that I

2577.05 --> 2581.2200000000003
am because they demonstrate how bad

2578.85 --> 2584.64
these boil the trolls actually are right

2581.22 --> 2587.97
well I would agree normally but I'm not

2584.64 --> 2589.71
looking for reasons to compare myself to

2587.97 --> 2592.35
others to make me feel good about myself

2589.71 --> 2594.27
I'd rather just be able to focus on good

2592.35 --> 2596.7
subjects that people learn things from

2594.27 --> 2600.15
and that's why I really want them out of

2596.7 --> 2602.3999999999996
the way because they do distract me they

2600.15 --> 2606.57
take me out of my momentum when I have

2602.4 --> 2607.89
good thoughts what can you be my

2606.57 --> 2610.4100000000003
previous comments about the Kola

2607.89 --> 2615.8399999999997
super-deep borehole I went oh right

2610.41 --> 2619.46
where was that I did see that who said

2615.84 --> 2619.46
that Trish

2620.96 --> 2629.54
oh yeah look into the Kola borehole hmm

2627.559 --> 2631.9100000000003
lots of information in a book written by

2629.54 --> 2638.119
John Fletcher and do some Richard

2631.91 --> 2644.54
research what you will find at blow fe

2638.119 --> 2646.369
wide open oh really huh borehole the

2644.54 --> 2648.44
pole did he find like an underground

2646.369 --> 2653.9900000000002
cave or something that's fascinating

2648.44 --> 2656.15
it's always fascinating okay super curve

2653.99 --> 2658.1299999999997
says sleeping warrior so you're part of

2656.15 --> 2661.339
flyer to feel better about yourself

2658.13 --> 2662.7200000000003
mayor of The Truman Show no I don't know

2661.339 --> 2664.94
how he can possibly come to that

2662.72 --> 2667.5499999999997
conclusion based on what I said I said

2664.94 --> 2669.38
don't bother sensor in the trolls cuz

2667.55 --> 2671.0
they make me feel good that doesn't mean

2669.38 --> 2673.94
that I'm here to be feeling good about

2671.0 --> 2675.92
the trolls it's all it's an illogical

2673.94 --> 2680.65
statement to make one autumn [ __ ] you

2675.92 --> 2683.2400000000002
claimed scientist you are ridiculous

2680.65 --> 2688.7000000000003
you're given even giving you time just

2683.24 --> 2690.069
by addressing user bad mood yeah here

2688.7 --> 2693.02
right that's exactly how I feel

2690.069 --> 2694.7
so it's Nathan live right now yeah he is

2693.02 --> 2703.19
he went live pretty early and don't know

2694.7 --> 2714.109
why he was gonna go out oh super-deep

2703.19 --> 2719.54
borehole on science golf your gateway to

2714.109 --> 2726.23
u.s. federal science wow that sounds so

2719.54 --> 2728.299
wrong they call themselves a gateway huh

2726.23 --> 2730.76
here's a question for you it's aimed at

2728.299 --> 2733.49
me ball ask at you spare room music says

2730.76 --> 2739.94
can you define what a troll is are we

2733.49 --> 2744.0989999999997
what a troll a troll is basically a kind

2739.94 --> 2748.64
of social behavior in which a person

2744.099 --> 2750.829
uses their anonymity to find some kind

2748.64 --> 2753.95
of creative freedom for themselves and

2750.829 --> 2758.809
then use that to nag

2753.95 --> 2761.39
or try to break yeah break the whatever

2758.809 --> 2764.0890000000004
train of thoughts they have try to just

2761.39 --> 2768.7599999999998
tear them down tear people down with

2764.089 --> 2773.049
outrageous and ridiculous claims just

2768.76 --> 2775.309
well it's it's presumed that it is to

2773.049 --> 2778.339
get the bright light out of the way so

2775.309 --> 2779.96
it doesn't stand out how miserable you

2778.339 --> 2782.5099999999998
actually are that's really the bottom

2779.96 --> 2785.15
line troll there's an easy definition

2782.51 --> 2788.2400000000002
somebody with no SOB's no no serves no

2785.15 --> 2789.92
content just like an empty channel that

2788.24 --> 2791.839
presents themselves initially on the

2789.92 --> 2794.7200000000003
face of it to be just someone disagree

2791.839 --> 2797.119
and basically they're not really people

2794.72 --> 2800.48
that just face it but oh but hold on

2797.119 --> 2803.3900000000003
that's their that's it that's a trick if

2800.48 --> 2806.2400000000002
you assume that because many of these

2803.39 --> 2807.5589999999997
socks that obviously have no identity

2806.24 --> 2810.319
and that's what they're hiding mind

2807.559 --> 2812.2000000000003
there could be people with real internet

2810.319 --> 2815.18
accounts they usually tend to be that

2812.2 --> 2818.18
but you never really find out until you

2815.18 --> 2819.8289999999997
figure out a trolling style associated

2818.18 --> 2822.14
with a certain individual and their

2819.829 --> 2825.559
interactions that may lead to them you

2822.14 --> 2830.0589999999997
doing that but most trolls are just

2825.559 --> 2832.7900000000004
people on the internet that do have

2830.059 --> 2837.53
accounts it's not always complete now

2832.79 --> 2840.5589999999997
lifers so wiggle says I was going to

2837.53 --> 2842.75
give Nathan a $30 year 30 u.s. dollar

2840.559 --> 2844.6400000000003
challenge to pass a simple test on the

2842.75 --> 2846.859
stuff he claims to know about trick on

2844.64 --> 2848.39
physics etc well why don't you do that

2846.859 --> 2850.79
Wiggles rather than weasel it the way he

2848.39 --> 2852.89
did last time he tried challenge it just

2850.79 --> 2853.549
say Nathan I'll give you $30 if you pass

2852.89 --> 2855.41
this test

2853.549 --> 2857.329
don't don't no we're there any more

2855.41 --> 2859.3089999999997
complicated that that's what you did

2857.329 --> 2861.4700000000003
wrong last time just tell him I'll give

2859.309 --> 2864.8190000000004
you $30 if you take this test and pass

2861.47 --> 2864.819
it that simple

2865.759 --> 2872.339
all right okay so the super deep Cola

2869.519 --> 2876.8999999999996
super-deep borehole I'm looking at it on

2872.339 --> 2880.019
Wikipedia it is that that that giant are

2876.9 --> 2882.9
the very small tunnel in Russia that is

2880.019 --> 2887.97
firstly the deepest hole so somebody

2882.9 --> 2889.98
wrote a book about that so Trish Vlad

2887.97 --> 2893.91
says that she's got an empty channel but

2889.98 --> 2895.289
you do have a subs so most of the troll

2893.91 --> 2897.48
accounts have less than three soaps

2895.289 --> 2901.369
I have a call points of five he got less

2897.48 --> 2905.309
than five then I consider you a troll I

2901.369 --> 2911.4900000000002
just treat people by how they are you

2905.309 --> 2913.38
know I remember one guy who it was a

2911.49 --> 2914.999
troll account and I looked on he had I

2913.38 --> 2917.099
think he had no subs I said come back

2914.999 --> 2920.18
when you got 20 subs ten minutes later

2917.099 --> 2920.1800000000003
he came back with 26

2920.42 --> 2925.4990000000003
well yeah it's look if you're a sock

2923.279 --> 2927.809
master you know how to make giant

2925.499 --> 2931.999
amounts of troll socks like this one

2927.809 --> 2935.46
point five fold guy and the other one

2931.999 --> 2937.98
yeah it's not that hard to basically

2935.46 --> 2940.2
then just make 20 sock accounts just to

2937.98 --> 2944.46
subscribe to one sock account to give

2940.2 --> 2946.999
them 20 subscribers so super curve says

2944.46 --> 2949.829
subs don't make you correct I agree or

2946.999 --> 2950.6699999999996
make your view any more legitimate I

2949.829 --> 2953.099
disagree

2950.67 --> 2954.42
if you have no subs then you are you

2953.099 --> 2956.94
don't have a valid voice to be

2954.42 --> 2958.71
questioning anything in my view okay

2956.94 --> 2960.539
I'll entertain if it's more than five

2958.71 --> 2962.2200000000003
yeah let's have an example let's see how

2960.539 --> 2964.5890000000004
many super curbs go he must have some

2962.22 --> 2967.7099999999996
cuz he's been around a while super curve

2964.589 --> 2969.089
has two subs so even getting your name

2967.71 --> 2970.619
mentioned you should be doing laps

2969.089 --> 2973.019
around the victory pitch that you're

2970.619 --> 2976.349
getting the attention that you crave in

2973.019 --> 2979.109
reality you just control look look at

2976.349 --> 2981.96
face faces trying to get it he really

2979.109 --> 2984.9
does try it's just never really working

2981.96 --> 2987.21
yeah he says no but look he's really

2984.9 --> 2987.9
trying to be smart he says subs don't

2987.21 --> 2990.7200000000003
mean anything

2987.9 --> 2992.73
always has Arwen has one point 4 K

2990.72 --> 2995.4599999999996
subscribers and look at the metrics of

2992.73 --> 2999.39
on this video right now you know why

2995.46 --> 3002.21
that is because my show is very

2999.39 --> 3004.7
in the United States so that means that

3002.21 --> 3007.25
the majority of my subscribers which are

3004.7 --> 3009.4399999999996
American by the way they're just not

3007.25 --> 3012.59
awake yet and they watch my video later

3009.44 --> 3015.5
on in the day so for my channel I

3012.59 --> 3017.63
apparently don't have as much live

3015.5 --> 3021.35
viewers as people that actually just

3017.63 --> 3024.08
view my videos afterwards so and as for

3021.35 --> 3027.74
all the votes downward I got a lot of

3024.08 --> 3030.31
sock a lot of sock votes down every

3027.74 --> 3034.0099999999998
single time it's ridiculous

3030.31 --> 3038.33
sometimes it more than I get total life

3034.01 --> 3040.2400000000002
viewers so I just leave it there just to

3038.33 --> 3042.89
show that it still goes on

3040.24 --> 3045.2599999999998
there's many flat earth channels I've

3042.89 --> 3047.2999999999997
not that I've seen that have more

3045.26 --> 3050.2400000000002
subscribes to me that just have turned

3047.3 --> 3055.4900000000002
it off they turn it off specifically

3050.24 --> 3058.5499999999997
because of that nonsense because there's

3055.49 --> 3060.2299999999996
just a group of people out there I don't

3058.55 --> 3063.53
know how many of them they are but

3060.23 --> 3066.92
they're probably a lot more than we know

3063.53 --> 3069.0400000000004
not as much as we are made to think but

3066.92 --> 3075.38
definitely more than we could imagine

3069.04 --> 3077.0299999999997
that are just trying to just burden the

3075.38 --> 3080.54
Flat Earth and now they're doing it like

3077.03 --> 3082.6400000000003
this just massive down votes before

3080.54 --> 3084.41
anything has even happened and they do

3082.64 --> 3085.19
it every time they've been doing it on

3084.41 --> 3088.7799999999997
the Flat Earth

3085.19 --> 3090.68
early-bird show from the start almost

3088.78 --> 3093.4700000000003
every single Flat Earth

3090.68 --> 3100.46
early-bird show I had has huge amount of

3093.47 --> 3101.99
down votes so you know I don't mind I'm

3100.46 --> 3104.17
just fascinated that it keeps on

3101.99 --> 3104.1699999999996
happening

3104.32 --> 3110.5
so somebody asking about whimpers being

3107.17 --> 3112.3
suman's to rub the court of Bronte are

3110.5 --> 3118.0
you familiar with what runs his current

3112.3 --> 3119.38
position is are we on what what he's

3118.0 --> 3121.21
trying to do because of the way bumpers

3119.38 --> 3122.8
behaves and he won't ever answer

3121.21 --> 3124.84
straight questions right always

3122.8 --> 3127.03
obfuscates points never get a straight

3124.84 --> 3130.15
answer out of him well I've managed to

3127.03 --> 3131.5600000000004
do it well runs he's trying to stop him

3130.15 --> 3133.42
from doing that and he said like like

3131.56 --> 3135.4
this if the only way to do it is to

3133.42 --> 3137.56
force you with a meat bomb to stay

3135.4 --> 3139.36
silent for three four five ten minutes

3137.56 --> 3140.44
while someone makes the point that's

3139.36 --> 3141.82
what we're gonna have to do it's always

3140.44 --> 3144.4
changed it to a more of a courtroom

3141.82 --> 3147.73
style literally to stop rompers from one

3144.4 --> 3150.52
person because he can't shop so modest

3147.73 --> 3151.9900000000002
on now is he's actually said and you can

3150.52 --> 3153.85
summons anybody want and I just thought

3151.99 --> 3155.4399999999996
okay are someone's office and let's get

3153.85 --> 3156.7599999999998
rompers on a really narrow a really

3155.44 --> 3159.43
narrow point that you really can't

3156.76 --> 3162.19
respond to without contradicting science

3159.43 --> 3164.74
and so I challenged in must the other

3162.19 --> 3165.76
day on the trivanti show and it'll be up

3164.74 --> 3167.5899999999997
in in it I think it's nine o'clock

3165.76 --> 3170.05
tonight which will be 10 o'clock for you

3167.59 --> 3172.81
now and I've got British summer time ten

3170.05 --> 3175.51
o'clock for you and then right it's an

3172.81 --> 3178.5099999999998
arrow point bumpers claims that scales

3175.51 --> 3180.88
are a force measuring device well if

3178.51 --> 3184.7200000000003
that's true then he's in contradiction

3180.88 --> 3186.25
with current science we wiggle his work

3184.72 --> 3187.99
wiggle his way out of it but when he

3186.25 --> 3190.03
gets the opportunity to not when I'm

3187.99 --> 3191.41
making my point so I will get my point

3190.03 --> 3192.7900000000004
across tonight and I will make it

3191.41 --> 3194.6499999999996
concise and it will demonstrate that

3192.79 --> 3196.66
Wampus is cornered so high the scales

3194.65 --> 3199.1800000000003
he's not either scale or not a force

3196.66 --> 3201.3999999999996
measuring device tall or rompers is

3199.18 --> 3204.52
gonna have to either debunk Einstein

3201.4 --> 3205.6600000000003
admit that mass is a force or there's

3204.52 --> 3207.67
another one I can't remember what it is

3205.66 --> 3209.3799999999997
now but he's gonna get his bombs back

3207.67 --> 3210.67
so check out runty show later on it's

3209.38 --> 3215.4300000000003
gonna be down a quad british lot more

3210.67 --> 3217.66
time all right cool okay fine yep I

3215.43 --> 3220.93
don't even know why you would try that

3217.66 --> 3222.8199999999997
kind of thing with Rufus really it's

3220.93 --> 3224.5299999999997
whoa I think what we're trying to do is

3222.82 --> 3226.3
also we illustrate that these borders

3224.53 --> 3228.07
when they get cornered they will not ask

3226.3 --> 3229.4500000000003
well they will never ever admit that

3228.07 --> 3231.04
they might be wrong they will just

3229.45 --> 3233.2
always get my Bren differences I think

3231.04 --> 3235.55
people that have been following the

3233.2 --> 3238.46
debates and the scene kind of

3235.55 --> 3241.4
know that by now rhombus does it every

3238.46 --> 3243.26
single time but maybe for newcomers here

3241.4 --> 3245.42
we go so look at look at Wiggles in

3243.26 --> 3247.3100000000004
shock Wiegel says what does he say he

3245.42 --> 3248.92
says scales do measure force and scales

3247.31 --> 3252.86
won't work on the moon for example

3248.92 --> 3254.7200000000003
Wiggles have you tried it out Rufus was

3252.86 --> 3256.58
correct about that will Wiggles in about

3254.72 --> 3259.49
eight hours or six hours from now

3256.58 --> 3261.29
whatever it is you will watch on the

3259.49 --> 3263.24
bronze YZ channel you'll see rhombus get

3261.29 --> 3264.43
in this is that hundred to him it's

3263.24 --> 3266.9599999999996
glorious

3264.43 --> 3269.0299999999997
wiggle you're a [ __ ] well well

3266.96 --> 3273.02
technically you know I've argued that

3269.03 --> 3274.9100000000003
scales do measure a force there's not

3273.02 --> 3277.4
the force of gravity though it's just

3274.91 --> 3280.19
the remember that for relative density

3277.4 --> 3282.52
disequilibrium in a stock position when

3280.19 --> 3285.23
that happens it that disequilibrium

3282.52 --> 3286.91
translate into localized pressure and

3285.23 --> 3289.82
that's what the scale measures

3286.91 --> 3291.08
I agree but rumpus claims the rumpus

3289.82 --> 3292.9100000000003
makes an another claim which is

3291.08 --> 3294.5299999999997
contradictory he says that mass is not a

3292.91 --> 3297.2
force weight is a force

3294.53 --> 3298.3700000000003
well if weights not the only difference

3297.2 --> 3300.77
between mass and weight is the

3298.37 --> 3302.2999999999997
calculation of little G right and little

3300.77 --> 3304.13
G is the acceleration due to Earth's

3302.3 --> 3305.96
gravity well Einstein said the earth

3304.13 --> 3308.06
didn't have a gravitational force

3305.96 --> 3311.36
he said gravity was the effect of the

3308.06 --> 3313.19
carriages space-time so Newton's no

3311.36 --> 3315.3700000000003
you're mixing up Newton with Einstein

3313.19 --> 3315.37
now

3315.4 --> 3318.9500000000003
what did I say that

3317.09 --> 3323.36
now we started out saying Newton and

3318.95 --> 3326.5099999999998
then went into Einstein claim I get it

3323.36 --> 3328.94
Newton thought it was mass attracting

3326.51 --> 3332.36
mass but he never claimed the hypothesis

3328.94 --> 3334.55
on officially on paper you can look it

3332.36 --> 3337.79
up on Google if you like and then

3334.55 --> 3340.19
Einstein and his whole controller team

3337.79 --> 3343.49
came in to change the landscape and then

3340.19 --> 3347.18
claimed that he had found the elusive

3343.49 --> 3351.2599999999998
cause of gravity with ineffectual medium

3347.18 --> 3353.39
and then that was just accepted for no

3351.26 --> 3355.4
good reason really and there was a lot

3353.39 --> 3357.3199999999997
of protest against it from the science

3355.4 --> 3359.21
community as well it's they don't like

3357.32 --> 3362.27
to talk about that in mainstream science

3359.21 --> 3364.28
but there was huge official protests

3362.27 --> 3367.34
almost on the same level as for example

3364.28 --> 3369.0600000000004
architects against 911 that kind of

3367.34 --> 3371.52
thing that happened back in the

3369.06 --> 3375.09
among the scientists in response to sigh

3371.52 --> 3378.17
two designs landscape and the education

3375.09 --> 3382.71
landscape being changed by Einstein a

3378.17 --> 3385.23
lot of feedback on that that yeah

3382.71 --> 3388.56
mainstream science doesn't really like

3385.23 --> 3390.54
to talk about a lot mainstream science

3388.56 --> 3392.82
is usually mainstream pseudoscience on

3390.54 --> 3396.62
healing the big arguments that's why I'm

3392.82 --> 3396.6200000000003
doing the fingers every time I say that

3397.79 --> 3404.97
indeed so yeah I was gonna round out the

3402.75 --> 3408.09
shell and they're gonna let everybody

3404.97 --> 3411.2099999999996
over to Nathan's indeed so it is

3408.09 --> 3420.84
thanks for being here Randy no worries

3411.21 --> 3425.85
was good at the debates alright so that

3420.84 --> 3429.78
was fun so thanks everyone for coming I

3425.85 --> 3431.8199999999997
hope you liked this video if you did

3429.78 --> 3433.2000000000003
please don't forget to upload it and if

3431.82 --> 3434.73
you haven't already subscribed to my

3433.2 --> 3435.99
channel hit the bell notification so you

3434.73 --> 3438.0
know when I'm going live which is

3435.99 --> 3440.64
normally 2:00 p.m. Amsterdam time every

3438.0 --> 3442.11
day also please keep on supporting my

3440.64 --> 3444.75
channel through the Super chats and

3442.11 --> 3449.01
thank you everyone that's donated today

3444.75 --> 3450.72
Trish Blythe and Amanda you always glad

3449.01 --> 3455.67
have you around

3450.72 --> 3456.9599999999996
hashtag meifa indeed I'm gonna join the

3455.67 --> 3459.92
Flat Earth debates that have already

3456.96 --> 3462.3
been live for almost 30 minutes now and

3459.92 --> 3468.87
I will be back tomorrow with flattered

3462.3 --> 3470.3
the earlybird number 280 so yeah until

3468.87 --> 3474.8399999999997
the next video

3470.3 --> 3476.67
keep it flat and I have no idea when

3474.84 --> 3478.79
mark Sargent is going to be joining my

3476.67 --> 3482.16
show if ever it would be kind of cool

3478.79 --> 3485.79
but I don't think I have the proper time

3482.16 --> 3487.95
slot for that for him way too early for

3485.79 --> 3489.69
him but who knows in the future it will

3487.95 --> 3493.8799999999997
be kind of fun to have him anyway until

3489.69 --> 3523.92
the next video keep it flat

3493.88 --> 3523.92
