stormy

116.159 --> 122.32000000000001
not too wet so far yesterday there was

119.04 --> 122.32000000000001
some rain here and there but

122.88 --> 126.479
it's kind of like a restless day

127.6 --> 133.92
clouds are going pretty fast up there

130.64 --> 135.92
there are some blue spots

133.92 --> 143.83999999999997
but yeah i haven't seen much direct

135.92 --> 143.83999999999997
sunlight so far

149.04 --> 153.04
right so

153.12 --> 159.20000000000002
it's sunday that 23rd of may 2021

see you brand

163.519 --> 171.84
m good to see you how are you all doing

166.56 --> 171.84
on this sunday

182.84 --> 188.8
right

185.12 --> 188.8
so got green tea

190.0 --> 194.0
and i got a gusto energy drink that i

192.879 --> 196.959
seem to have

194.0 --> 198.4
have lost i had lost it in my

196.959 --> 201.2
refrigerator so i

198.4 --> 203.36
just noticed like hey wait there's a

201.2 --> 204.95899999999997
gusto energy drink there when did i buy

203.36 --> 207.59900000000002
that

204.959 --> 210.31900000000002
so that was nice surprise i think i

207.599 --> 213.83999999999997
bought it like two days ago

210.319 --> 213.83999999999997
i forgot about it saturday

214.0 --> 227.36
right so youtube's playing

217.519 --> 231.519
around again which is very frustrating

227.36 --> 231.519
gotta check out what this error actually

238.84 --> 244.159
means

241.12 --> 246.239
i don't know but yeah

244.159 --> 248.879
like yesterday youtube is just doing

246.239 --> 248.879
this weird

249.2 --> 255.67999999999998
blinking again on my side and it's super

252.84 --> 259.519
distracting

255.68 --> 269.84000000000003
so i am kind of frustrated with this

259.519 --> 269.84000000000003
anyway hello james mason good to see you

277.6 --> 285.199
right but at least it seems like

281.44 --> 287.84
nothing of that stays behind

285.199 --> 290.40000000000003
on the recording and i don't think that

287.84 --> 293.919
you guys see it so it's just on my side

290.4 --> 297.44
very weird and it makes no sense

293.919 --> 299.52
because i tried watching the youtube

297.44 --> 301.12
on other browsers and it does the same

299.52 --> 311.84
thing everywhere it makes

301.12 --> 311.84000000000003
no damn sense whatsoever

314.56 --> 325.84
for a good measure i'll just demonstrate

316.4 --> 325.84
it again

329.28 --> 339.84
all right

342.639 --> 350.84000000000003
see hey

346.0 --> 352.96
here we go again good morning or good

350.84 --> 357.67999999999995
afternoon

352.96 --> 361.44
right so that's not annoying at all

357.68 --> 367.44
yeah it is anyway i'll try not to let it

361.44 --> 371.28
distract me

367.44 --> 371.28
at least the chat isn't blinking

374.08 --> 378.08
maybe we should just do a pop-out chat

379.6 --> 382.72
and leave it to that

392.84 --> 395.84
what

395.919 --> 398.24
all right

399.09 --> 402.279
[Music]

403.36 --> 408.72
yeah new technical challenge on a

405.52 --> 411.12
monthly basis

408.72 --> 413.91900000000004
every time for no apparent reason but

411.12 --> 413.919
yeah i'll live

414.319 --> 421.44
so i

418.08 --> 423.919
didn't make notes but i think i remember

421.44 --> 423.919
most of it

425.21 --> 430.31899999999996
[Music]

426.56 --> 430.319
let me just double check

435.52 --> 442.08
right yeah no owned benjamin yesterday

440.24 --> 446.479
but

442.08 --> 446.479
martin litka flatter day night

448.0 --> 451.84
that was a lot of fun

452.08 --> 458.15999999999997
it gets very silly sometimes

455.199 --> 458.16
it takes up this

459.12 --> 464.319
borderline sexual what not sometimes

462.4 --> 466.23999999999995
it's kind of over

464.319 --> 467.759
content i don't know he just plays

466.24 --> 471.84000000000003
around with that [ __ ]

467.759 --> 471.84000000000003
it seems that youtube is okay with it

472.879 --> 477.84000000000003
it's funny to see like the older naughty

475.52 --> 480.31899999999996
stuff

477.84 --> 484.56
for the mindset of that time and

480.319 --> 484.56
contrast to now but yeah other than that

485.199 --> 488.639
it's just fun hanging around with martin

486.96 --> 492.0
luther in chat

488.639 --> 495.039
on saturday it almost feels a little

492.0 --> 495.039
bit like going out

495.199 --> 498.24
and i think that's his intention but

497.039 --> 507.84
anyway

498.24 --> 507.84000000000003
that was that

509.28 --> 515.5989999999999
right oh yeah uh somebody yesterday

512.56 --> 521.8389999999999
a lot of people handed me out links

515.599 --> 521.839
hey george sanford just

524.08 --> 528.399
uploaded a video i think i just got the

532.839 --> 538.8000000000001
notification

534.48 --> 538.8000000000001
okay 15 minute video

541.04 --> 545.92
i like his guest very pretty yeah yeah

542.959 --> 545.92
that girl oof

553.2 --> 563.839
very interesting girl

569.279 --> 572.88
uh yeah def i could definitely state

571.279 --> 576.08
that girls like that

572.88 --> 579.68
lie within my type range

576.08 --> 579.6800000000001
as to what i find attractive

581.04 --> 585.279
and she's very smart and sharp and

586.08 --> 590.48
like militantly awakened and that's

588.399 --> 591.519
something that i find quite attractive

590.48 --> 593.519
in a woman

591.519 --> 595.04
like when they're not just trying to

593.519 --> 598.16
virtual signal

595.04 --> 602.079
they're actually they have that fire

598.16 --> 606.399
yeah gives me the shivers in a good way

602.079 --> 606.399
so yeah that was very amusing

611.12 --> 616.24
hello george sanford by the way uh

614.32 --> 617.36
yeah but yesterday i got a whole bunch

616.24 --> 620.5600000000001
of links from people

617.36 --> 623.04
and one of them was a dutch

620.56 --> 623.04
video

623.68 --> 629.1999999999999
should let me just look in my history to

627.76 --> 633.04
see the exact

629.2 --> 635.839
name again

633.04 --> 635.8389999999999
what's it called

645.12 --> 650.32
right yeah yeah adam curry on the jensen

648.0 --> 650.32
show

651.279 --> 654.399
that's funny adam curry man like even

654.0 --> 658.16
like

654.399 --> 662.079
what is it ten years ago

658.16 --> 662.079
that guy was doing stuff and

662.48 --> 666.88
it's funny to see that he's still going

664.32 --> 669.2
at it but yeah they did mention flat

666.88 --> 672.56
earth and were kind of

669.2 --> 676.8000000000001
defensive of their globe but

672.56 --> 679.04
at least i got the sense that they were

676.8 --> 681.76
giving some recognition at least to

679.04 --> 684.7199999999999
superficial arguments now

681.76 --> 686.72
i didn't get the the sense that they had

684.72 --> 689.12
actually looked into something like flat

686.72 --> 692.64
earth debates or ball busters

689.12 --> 694.9590000000001
from that video but it at least

692.64 --> 697.4399999999999
seemed like they were actually

694.959 --> 699.4399999999999
open-minded still from a baller position

697.44 --> 701.839
vantage point

699.44 --> 705.12
but it was it was interesting to see

701.839 --> 705.12
what they had to say about it

705.36 --> 712.0
and it didn't just start

709.2 --> 712.9590000000001
outright attacking flat earth because

712.0 --> 716.0
they

712.959 --> 719.4399999999999
didn't agree to it without any real

716.0 --> 721.68
arguments by the way but yeah that was

719.44 --> 725.6
interesting to see

721.68 --> 727.279
in the netherlands and among these

725.6 --> 728.0
people that have been going at it for a

727.279 --> 731.8389999999999
while that

728.0 --> 731.839
they're still

732.32 --> 736.48
bringing it up that was interesting

742.839 --> 745.839
anyway

747.36 --> 751.12
hello good servant good to see you

754.72 --> 758.0
right but anyway yeah the adam curry

757.519 --> 760.72
thing

758.0 --> 764.24
it was all dutch although adam curry

760.72 --> 764.24
just typically has a hand of

764.32 --> 769.7600000000001
constantly resorting back to english

767.839 --> 773.36
american

769.76 --> 774.639
so it's really it really shows how long

773.36 --> 777.2
he's been living there

774.639 --> 778.88
apparently i got reminded he's living in

777.2 --> 780.72
texas i think

778.88 --> 783.12
for a while and that's really rubbing

780.72 --> 788.24
off on him

783.12 --> 788.24
huh ah yeah good servant three more days

789.44 --> 794.8000000000001
that's good to know yeah i bet you're

792.24 --> 794.8
excited

798.88 --> 801.8389999999999
huh

810.16 --> 816.3199999999999
who is in texas adam curry is just a

813.279 --> 819.04
media guy that was

816.32 --> 819.9200000000001
in the netherlands he was kind of like

819.04 --> 822.399
mainstream

819.92 --> 825.12
and then he went conspiracy theorist in

822.399 --> 825.12
his own way

826.88 --> 829.8389999999999
like

831.279 --> 835.76
yeah so and he's like he was really

834.399 --> 837.839
early with this [ __ ]

835.76 --> 840.399
for in the netherlands like it's pretty

837.839 --> 842.8800000000001
much in the recent few years that

840.399 --> 844.399
conspiracy theory has really been

842.88 --> 847.76
developed and

844.399 --> 849.839
further researched and just people doing

847.76 --> 853.8389999999999
their thing within it in the netherlands

849.839 --> 853.839
but he was very early with it

854.16 --> 857.8389999999999
on media right

859.279 --> 863.519
it's a very rough comparison but you

861.36 --> 866.32
could almost compare it

863.519 --> 866.9590000000001
to owen benjamin being first in

866.32 --> 870.0790000000001
hollywood

866.959 --> 873.8389999999999
getting all the eyes popularity

870.079 --> 877.12
and then he goes to the big bear route

873.839 --> 878.0
path right adam curry did that in his

877.12 --> 882.48
own way

878.0 --> 885.279
being really in media in the netherlands

882.48 --> 885.9200000000001
and then he kind of like started to

885.279 --> 890.48
stray

885.92 --> 895.4399999999999
and not go with pc

890.48 --> 899.6
and all that when it came up

895.44 --> 904.24
and then later he moved to texas

899.6 --> 904.24
right anyway

908.959 --> 912.4799999999999
yeah you might be interested in watching

911.04 --> 915.519
it but it is all

912.48 --> 917.36
in dutch

915.519 --> 920.32
anyway dutch sailor brought forth this

917.36 --> 920.32
link yesterday

922.8 --> 929.519
does make me also kind of like

927.12 --> 930.399
do dutch people know i exist do they

929.519 --> 933.68
care

930.399 --> 936.959
like are they is anybody like outside of

933.68 --> 940.079
like this cluster really

936.959 --> 941.92
and maybe some agencies or whatever

940.079 --> 944.16
outside of this cluster of people are

941.92 --> 946.7199999999999
they looking into my channel and what i

944.16 --> 946.7199999999999
have to say

947.12 --> 950.72
because i get the idea that in the

948.88 --> 954.48
netherlands people don't really dig

950.72 --> 958.0
that deep into flat earth

954.48 --> 961.12
so i wonder if i'm being avoided

958.0 --> 961.12
this is kind of a shame

962.0 --> 966.32
i would really like to talk more about

965.6 --> 969.0400000000001
it

966.32 --> 983.839
even in dutch i can do it and i want to

969.04 --> 983.8389999999999
kind of train that as well

994.839 --> 998.48
right

996.16 --> 998.48
this

1000.88 --> 1011.8389999999999
all right

1013.44 --> 1018.8800000000001
okay i don't know what's up with you but

1015.6 --> 1018.88
i'm gonna take your wrench

1022.959 --> 1026.079
don't know why i gave it to you in the

1024.319 --> 1039.839
first place you keep

1026.079 --> 1039.839
acting weird it's crazy yet

1055.12 --> 1059.36
unwillingness to make a paradigm shift

1060.32 --> 1063.6789999999999
i guess so good servant

1064.84 --> 1067.84
but

1068.88 --> 1075.0390000000002
if they got the right mindset though

1072.24 --> 1075.679
then they wouldn't even necessarily have

1075.039 --> 1078.8799999999999
to do

1075.679 --> 1082.5590000000002
that like i did that

1078.88 --> 1084.88
when i was younger is basically

1082.559 --> 1086.3999999999999
you suspend your disbelief and you just

1084.88 --> 1089.3600000000001
try to

1086.4 --> 1092.3200000000002
think outside of your normal box even

1089.36 --> 1094.9599999999998
like outside of your comfort zone

1092.32 --> 1096.3999999999999
and you just try to make cohesive sense

1094.96 --> 1098.72
of it

1096.4 --> 1099.76
from the vantage point perspective that

1098.72 --> 1101.679
you're engaging with

1099.76 --> 1103.6
right that's how i got to kind of know

1101.679 --> 1105.76
some things about flat earth and some

1103.6 --> 1109.12
things that

1105.76 --> 1112.16
are brought forth as arguments

1109.12 --> 1114.9599999999998
much earlier in my life

1112.16 --> 1115.44
but i i didn't really believe it though

1114.96 --> 1117.919
like

1115.44 --> 1119.1200000000001
it would not be sufficient to snap me

1117.919 --> 1122.24
out of the dream

1119.12 --> 1123.28
but wouldn't damage me in some way

1122.24 --> 1126.72
either

1123.28 --> 1129.84
if you just basically start to

1126.72 --> 1130.72
consider it's like okay consider these

1129.84 --> 1133.6
things

1130.72 --> 1134.32
it's like when you talk to somebody that

1133.6 --> 1136.24
obviously

1134.32 --> 1137.4399999999998
likes to stick to the ball but they're

1136.24 --> 1140.559
still open-minded

1137.44 --> 1143.679
about having a conversation

1140.559 --> 1147.2
then don't just make don't get

1143.679 --> 1149.679
obsessed with breaking their ball

1147.2 --> 1151.52
view arguments or the things that

1149.679 --> 1154.72
causing them to hold on

1151.52 --> 1156.0
don't do that right we get used to that

1154.72 --> 1159.6000000000001
sort of thing here

1156.0 --> 1161.28
because of ballers that do that to us

1159.6 --> 1163.28
and then we kind of have to in a

1161.28 --> 1166.559
defensive

1163.28 --> 1168.559
response do that back

1166.559 --> 1169.9189999999999
and we get used to that but for

1168.559 --> 1172.559
outsiders

1169.919 --> 1173.679
it's very difficult to then deal with us

1172.559 --> 1177.6789999999999
and the way that we

1173.679 --> 1180.72
compose ourselves because

1177.679 --> 1180.72
they don't really

1180.88 --> 1185.44
they don't really want to fight they

1183.679 --> 1187.8400000000001
don't want

1185.44 --> 1189.8400000000001
they don't want to sacrifice their

1187.84 --> 1191.1999999999998
position and what they're dreaming about

1189.84 --> 1194.559
and everything

1191.2 --> 1197.679
just to learn something new right

1194.559 --> 1200.16
so don't try to force them to do that

1197.679 --> 1202.0800000000002
and i'm talking about outsiders not

1200.16 --> 1206.48
really hardcore ballers and all that

1202.08 --> 1209.84
because that's a whole different

1206.48 --> 1209.84
different range of people

1210.08 --> 1213.84
anyway

1211.2 --> 1216.64
[Music]

1213.84 --> 1218.6399999999999
and yeah i can do that i because of my

1216.64 --> 1222.0800000000002
personal experience

1218.64 --> 1223.1200000000001
even i can help people do that it's what

1222.08 --> 1226.8799999999999
i've been trying

1223.12 --> 1229.52
even like with the rectangular looping

1226.88 --> 1231.44
model conceptions right because that's

1229.52 --> 1232.72
already kind of outside of the normal

1231.44 --> 1235.28
range of

1232.72 --> 1236.32
what flat earthers typically think about

1235.28 --> 1239.2
so i have to

1236.32 --> 1240.559
not just you're wrong it's not a disc oh

1239.2 --> 1243.039
you're stupid

1240.559 --> 1243.9189999999999
why don't you think about it more

1243.039 --> 1245.84
looping

1243.919 --> 1247.2800000000002
right no that doesn't work so you have

1245.84 --> 1251.76
to just

1247.28 --> 1255.36
make them carefully consider the gaps

1251.76 --> 1257.6
and what they're actually presupposing

1255.36 --> 1259.36
when they think about the disc and why

1257.6 --> 1259.9189999999999
are they latching on to that right you

1259.36 --> 1261.76
have to

1259.919 --> 1264.64
approach it completely different in

1261.76 --> 1267.84
order to even make them able to consider

1264.64 --> 1267.8400000000001
what you're gonna tell them

1270.88 --> 1273.2800000000002
anyway

1274.32 --> 1278.31
but yeah i would be very very interested

1277.44 --> 1280.0
to

1278.31 --> 1283.6
[Music]

1280.0 --> 1285.12
talk about flat earth like even the

1283.6 --> 1287.28
psychology of it

1285.12 --> 1289.28
but yeah of course especially the the

1287.28 --> 1290.72
cosmogeny

1289.28 --> 1293.76
and the things that we're taking for

1290.72 --> 1297.919
granted and cross-referencing it with

1293.76 --> 1297.919
science development history

1299.2 --> 1303.28
and just physics in general i'd love to

1302.4 --> 1305.52
do that

1303.28 --> 1308.32
and i think i can do it in dutch i might

1305.52 --> 1310.32
have to resort to

1308.32 --> 1314.08
using a lot of english because that's

1310.32 --> 1317.84
how i learned it and then afterwards

1314.08 --> 1319.6
tried to translate that directly to

1317.84 --> 1321.36
because a lot of these things that i

1319.6 --> 1322.08
would be saying would be the first time

1321.36 --> 1325.4399999999998
i'd even

1322.08 --> 1328.08
get to saying that in dutch because i

1325.44 --> 1328.64
yeah outside of this show it's very rare

1328.08 --> 1332.1589999999999
that i

1328.64 --> 1347.8400000000001
try to dip into that high level

1332.159 --> 1347.8400000000001
thinking and i always do it in english

1352.88 --> 1355.1200000000001
right

1356.24 --> 1361.679
so yeah anybody's watching or hey

1359.679 --> 1363.2800000000002
i always say share the show on any

1361.679 --> 1366.5590000000002
platform you deem fit

1363.28 --> 1366.559
well that includes

1367.2 --> 1370.32
like some of these people like hey did

1369.6 --> 1372.24
you know

1370.32 --> 1374.08
there's this dutch flat earther doing an

1372.24 --> 1375.6
english show every day and he's a

1374.08 --> 1378.72
cosmogenist like

1375.6 --> 1381.1999999999998
i wouldn't mind right i don't really

1378.72 --> 1383.039
try to advertise myself to directly

1381.2 --> 1384.72
contact people that i don't really know

1383.039 --> 1386.24
too much about and it makes me really

1384.72 --> 1388.159
nervous

1386.24 --> 1390.96
if you get the feeling like they would

1388.159 --> 1394.0800000000002
be interested

1390.96 --> 1397.919
then i don't mind if you email or

1394.08 --> 1400.96
message my channel link

1397.919 --> 1403.919
or specific show that you think might be

1400.96 --> 1405.3600000000001
good for those people to see right

1403.919 --> 1408.48
doesn't always just have to be

1405.36 --> 1412.4799999999998
shared a live show but hey share videos

1408.48 --> 1412.48
that you think like this explains things

1412.72 --> 1417.84
right in contrast to other typical

1415.6 --> 1417.84
videos

1419.919 --> 1426.7990000000002
you think in english

1423.039 --> 1430.08
no i don't really think in language

1426.799 --> 1432.48
anymore i think

1430.08 --> 1432.48
i just

1435.2 --> 1443.279
but i am very good at

1438.559 --> 1445.039
quickly switching to english

1443.279 --> 1446.559
it's it's like i don't even think the

1445.039 --> 1449.279
language anymore like

1446.559 --> 1451.039
that's just done automatically it just

1449.279 --> 1453.4
rolls out

1451.039 --> 1455.44
i focus consciously more like on my

1453.4 --> 1458.72
pronunciation

1455.44 --> 1460.159
and sentence fluidity

1458.72 --> 1462.559
and all that right i have a bit of

1460.159 --> 1464.72
trouble with my sentence fluidity

1462.559 --> 1466.32
and everybody's noticed this especially

1464.72 --> 1469.2
when i think deep then

1466.32 --> 1471.279
sometimes leave these awkward long

1469.2 --> 1472.72
pauses and people think oh arwen's done

1471.279 --> 1474.32
talking when i'm in the middle of

1472.72 --> 1476.64
trying to formulate something and then

1474.32 --> 1479.2
he start talking yeah

1476.64 --> 1481.279
i have more trouble with that than

1479.2 --> 1487.8400000000001
actually thinking about the words

1481.279 --> 1487.84
because this is just second nature to me

1491.84 --> 1497.9189999999999
so yeah i think english and

1495.2 --> 1499.44
and dutch is just two different types of

1497.919 --> 1503.1200000000001
patterns

1499.44 --> 1504.72
and they fit they feel fit

1503.12 --> 1506.799
pretty easily next to one another

1504.72 --> 1510.76
there's no real big

1506.799 --> 1512.84
complications no heavy

1510.76 --> 1515.2
compartmentalizations between the two

1512.84 --> 1518.559
languages

1515.2 --> 1522.24
so it's not that difficult to just

1518.559 --> 1522.24
switch quickly on the spot

1522.48 --> 1526.88
i can literally do that i am one of

1524.32 --> 1529.36
those people not that i am going to do

1526.88 --> 1530.4
it but there's been people in the past

1529.36 --> 1533.84
that tried that too

1530.4 --> 1536.24
that can literally just talk dutch

1533.84 --> 1536.8799999999999
and then immediately after like switch

1536.24 --> 1540.0
and

1536.88 --> 1540.48
and explain what was said quickly in

1540.0 --> 1542.96
english

1540.48 --> 1543.919
or the other way around like i can

1542.96 --> 1546.64
actually do that

1543.919 --> 1547.2
i'm very much dual linguist in that but

1546.64 --> 1550.7990000000002
it's just

1547.2 --> 1551.679
only english i've never been been a real

1550.799 --> 1555.76
master at

1551.679 --> 1556.0
other languages i have other skills that

1555.76 --> 1559.039
i

1556.0 --> 1560.32
apply to other languages and that's like

1559.039 --> 1561.919
how to

1560.32 --> 1565.2
figure out what somebody's saying

1561.919 --> 1570.64
without actually understanding

1565.2 --> 1573.8400000000001
the syntax but just going on intensity

1570.64 --> 1574.7990000000002
so it's like how to how to superficially

1573.84 --> 1577.84
figure out

1574.799 --> 1578.24
where somebody stands right like do they

1577.84 --> 1580.9599999999998
need

1578.24 --> 1581.76
something are they trying to explain

1580.96 --> 1584.48
something to you

1581.76 --> 1585.44
right those markers that's what i've

1584.48 --> 1587.44
gotten good at

1585.44 --> 1589.44
with other languages to kind of figure

1587.44 --> 1591.6000000000001
out like what are they like what do they

1589.44 --> 1594.4
do

1591.6 --> 1596.559
so more like the cultural influences

1594.4 --> 1598.3200000000002
instead of the direct syntax

1596.559 --> 1599.6
although hey if i get exposed to a

1598.32 --> 1601.6
certain syntax

1599.6 --> 1602.6399999999999
eventually i will start to recognize

1601.6 --> 1605.52
patterns and then i

1602.64 --> 1607.2
might ask like oh i always hear this

1605.52 --> 1611.12
what does that specifically mean

1607.2 --> 1614.799
and then slowly

1611.12 --> 1617.52
i can graft in more literal

1614.799 --> 1619.44
language understanding it's how i

1617.52 --> 1620.32
learned english originally it's just

1619.44 --> 1622.159
that

1620.32 --> 1624.559
besides english have never been really

1622.159 --> 1627.679
exposed for longer times

1624.559 --> 1629.9189999999999
to other languages and because of just

1627.679 --> 1632.159
a lot of people understanding english on

1629.919 --> 1634.0800000000002
several levels

1632.159 --> 1635.44
instead of learning the other language i

1634.08 --> 1638.32
usually end up

1635.44 --> 1641.279
bridging it with my english that's what

1638.32 --> 1644.559
happened in spain even

1641.279 --> 1645.2
so yeah just for me it's just english

1644.559 --> 1647.76
and dutch

1645.2 --> 1648.72
that's what is really fluid with me in

1647.76 --> 1652.399
other languages

1648.72 --> 1654.159
i approach that differently but i do

1652.399 --> 1657.76
know that i am

1654.159 --> 1658.48
dynamic and i could technically even at

1657.76 --> 1660.72
this age

1658.48 --> 1662.08
still learn other languages if i was

1660.72 --> 1664.96
like really

1662.08 --> 1664.96
stuck in that

1666.96 --> 1670.0
it's just that i've been mostly stuck to

1669.12 --> 1672.0
english

1670.0 --> 1674.559
everything i'm really interested in is

1672.0 --> 1674.559
usually

1680.84 --> 1683.84
english

1684.08 --> 1687.1999999999998
one world languages will be facilitated

1686.88 --> 1697.2
by

1687.2 --> 1701.039
what what does that even mean

1697.2 --> 1701.039
hello joseph369

1703.039 --> 1707.12
learning spanish would be helpful right

1704.96 --> 1707.1200000000001
but

1707.279 --> 1712.159
the only real way to learn it is to be

1709.52 --> 1712.1589999999999
among them

1714.799 --> 1718.6399999999999
and then they would have to have some

1717.84 --> 1722.1589999999999
patience

1718.64 --> 1725.279
with your not able to speak

1722.159 --> 1727.44
yeah and then and then there would be a

1725.279 --> 1729.039
lot of incentive from the inside from

1727.44 --> 1732.0800000000002
the spirit to actually

1729.039 --> 1735.36
start figuring it out right because it's

1732.08 --> 1735.36
really necessity

1737.2 --> 1740.559
that makes you learn it unless you're

1739.84 --> 1743.84
just

1740.559 --> 1753.44
super good at figuring out languages

1743.84 --> 1756.24
if you have that special talent

1753.44 --> 1758.24
logan's run hello my english thinking

1756.24 --> 1758.88
and especially typing is faster than

1758.24 --> 1762.0
most

1758.88 --> 1763.6000000000001
who are english over here the weather is

1762.0 --> 1765.44
fabulous thank you logan tron i

1763.6 --> 1781.279
appreciate that

1765.44 --> 1784.559
i do my best

1781.279 --> 1785.279
you know what i what i'm really curious

1784.559 --> 1788.48
about

1785.279 --> 1791.84
more is the actual

1788.48 --> 1795.2
energy origins or the spiritual origins

1791.84 --> 1797.52
of languages because because i'm

1795.2 --> 1798.72
always drenched in the in the english

1797.52 --> 1801.9189999999999
language

1798.72 --> 1806.0
from several directions like

1801.919 --> 1809.76
like actual british or american

1806.0 --> 1811.52
or australian or like even things like

1809.76 --> 1815.12
scottish

1811.52 --> 1818.6399999999999
irish like there are

1815.12 --> 1823.039
sayings and ways of saying things

1818.64 --> 1826.72
that are kind of not

1823.039 --> 1827.279
like it's it's mysterious where it comes

1826.72 --> 1831.44
from

1827.279 --> 1835.44
and sometimes i put things down in a way

1831.44 --> 1838.799
that i don't understand it's like

1835.44 --> 1842.24
i know what i'm saying right now is like

1838.799 --> 1846.0
a way of saying it that's typical

1842.24 --> 1846.3990000000001
to to that region like this is what they

1846.0 --> 1848.72
say

1846.399 --> 1850.7199999999998
and everybody understands what you mean

1848.72 --> 1853.279
when you say it but when you actually

1850.72 --> 1856.559
look at what it is saying

1853.279 --> 1858.48
then it becomes weird because i often

1856.559 --> 1859.44
end up not really understanding with

1858.48 --> 1862.159
those very

1859.44 --> 1863.679
specific ways of saying things what it

1862.159 --> 1866.3990000000001
actually means

1863.679 --> 1867.3600000000001
but i do still understand what it means

1866.399 --> 1871.84
it's just

1867.36 --> 1871.84
ah it's like this weird

1872.48 --> 1879.84
aberration in or like old

1875.76 --> 1879.84
old slang or something

1879.919 --> 1884.3200000000002
but sometimes i just pick up and i just

1882.159 --> 1885.3600000000001
put things down in a way and i know like

1884.32 --> 1888.48
this is correct

1885.36 --> 1888.9599999999998
i've seen other people say this or heard

1888.48 --> 1891.679
it

1888.96 --> 1892.08
say that heard them say it and i know

1891.679 --> 1895.919
that

1892.08 --> 1896.399
that works but then i look at it and i'm

1895.919 --> 1899.279
like

1896.399 --> 1901.4399999999998
but what does it actually mean like why

1899.279 --> 1904.64
is it arranged in that form

1901.44 --> 1906.799
it's weird but it works right

1904.64 --> 1908.72
and i love that [ __ ] especially when it

1906.799 --> 1912.399
just comes rolling out of me

1908.72 --> 1915.84
and then i'm like what what is that

1912.399 --> 1917.6789999999999
i know it comes from that language but

1915.84 --> 1919.279
and i picked up on it but i don't

1917.679 --> 1922.799
actually

1919.279 --> 1926.159
fully understand what it really meant

1922.799 --> 1928.559
i just understand like

1926.159 --> 1930.7990000000002
how you would interpret that and how it

1928.559 --> 1932.84
works out

1930.799 --> 1935.84
language is a really weird thing

1932.84 --> 1935.84
sometimes

1936.72 --> 1942.08
i can't really think of a direct example

1940.64 --> 1949.8400000000001
for it by the way at

1942.08 --> 1949.84
this moment but i have these moments

1953.84 --> 1958.8799999999999
because i in a way i've just prioritized

1962.0 --> 1966.96
general interpretation understanding

1964.88 --> 1970.7990000000002
consensus

1966.96 --> 1970.799
of language over

1971.039 --> 1975.679
yeah over like making it efficiently

1974.399 --> 1977.84
correct

1975.679 --> 1977.8400000000001
right

1979.279 --> 1986.88
making it all grammatical oh god

1982.48 --> 1986.88
i think there's like some arabian

1988.84 --> 1992.72
weddings

1990.08 --> 1993.6
they were playing that music very loud

1992.72 --> 1997.44
this morning

1993.6 --> 2005.84
and now there's a line of cars honking

1997.44 --> 2005.8400000000001
coming by

2016.399 --> 2033.84
a journal for posterity

2020.0 --> 2033.84
but that's another word posterity

2049.839 --> 2053.7599999999998
all right anyway if road rage know

2053.919 --> 2061.839
just the line of cars in a row honking

2065.839 --> 2070.0789999999997
anyway let me look at the chat what are

2067.599 --> 2070.079
you saying

2072.839 --> 2075.839
hmm

2080.96 --> 2089.77
can i share a link fv related yeah sure

2083.919 --> 2097.7599999999998
tara 306.

2089.77 --> 2097.7599999999998
[Music]

2100.839 --> 2117.839
um

2102.8 --> 2117.8390000000004
oh yum

2141.04 --> 2145.839
ai translation

2146.8 --> 2152.1600000000003
okay joseph369 so you mean basically

2149.92 --> 2153.76
like a universal translator

2152.16 --> 2155.359
well there's not really going to be a

2153.76 --> 2157.2000000000003
separate language then there's just

2155.359 --> 2160.7999999999997
going to be

2157.2 --> 2160.7999999999997
quick translation everywhere

2167.52 --> 2171.04
by the way when you do that and you

2169.44 --> 2174.7200000000003
leave it to ai

2171.04 --> 2178.24
then subtle translations like subtle

2174.72 --> 2179.04
cultural elements for example are likely

2178.24 --> 2181.2
to be lost

2179.04 --> 2182.16
in translation right that's the

2181.2 --> 2185.52
difference as

2182.16 --> 2188.56
when you get a person translator

2185.52 --> 2192.16
it's like a real interpreter

2188.56 --> 2192.88
right interpreters are much better than

2192.16 --> 2195.92
an ai

2192.88 --> 2198.2400000000002
auto translator because interpreters may

2195.92 --> 2200.0
also recognize through the cross

2198.24 --> 2203.68
reference the exposure to the language

2200.0 --> 2206.72
in the culture certain types of

2203.68 --> 2208.48
extra information being given with what

2206.72 --> 2210.3199999999997
is said

2208.48 --> 2215.599
rather than just make a literal

2210.32 --> 2217.839
translation right

2215.599 --> 2221.04
like a good interpreter that really

2217.839 --> 2224.32
understands the culture of the language

2221.04 --> 2227.52
is very valuable compared to

2224.32 --> 2228.1600000000003
auto translating systems because they

2227.52 --> 2232.48
understand

2228.16 --> 2236.7999999999997
also like the implications and they may

2232.48 --> 2238.96
use that knowledge to relay

2236.8 --> 2240.2400000000002
that part of the information in what

2238.96 --> 2244.8
they're gonna

2240.24 --> 2244.7999999999997
translate it to to the recipient

2251.28 --> 2271.8390000000004
google news okay what is that

2255.68 --> 2271.839
let me check it out

2282.839 --> 2285.839
okay

2286.48 --> 2288.72
oh

2289.92 --> 2297.119
hmm all right so

2294.88 --> 2299.359
this article you posted territ is

2297.119 --> 2302.6400000000003
basically

2299.359 --> 2305.359
in a rather unique moment the

2302.64 --> 2306.0
the skies cleared up to a level that you

2305.359 --> 2313.839
could see

2306.0 --> 2313.839
incredibly far that's roughly it right

2314.96 --> 2320.56
that is very far how far is that

2318.0 --> 2320.56
technically

2322.88 --> 2330.7200000000003
200 kilometers

2327.04 --> 2331.92
so you could literally see from one

2330.72 --> 2335.9199999999996
mountain to another

2331.92 --> 2341.839
200 kilometers in between them

2335.92 --> 2341.839
that's quite a distance

2344.8 --> 2348.079
i bet there's no mentioning of earth

2346.8 --> 2349.42
curve in this article

2348.079 --> 2351.119
right

2349.42 --> 2355.839
[Music]

2351.119 --> 2355.839
i would avoid it

2357.68 --> 2369.839
awesome interesting thank you for

2359.52 --> 2369.839
sharing that there 306.

2380.88 --> 2384.96
yeah terror 306 the article doesn't

2383.2 --> 2385.52
mention that flat earth yeah of course

2384.96 --> 2389.04
because

2385.52 --> 2392.56
that way it's just data and it'll

2389.04 --> 2396.0
actually outlive all the

2392.56 --> 2398.0
nonsense right

2396.0 --> 2399.92
it's not going to get targeted because

2398.0 --> 2402.96
of flat earth or

2399.92 --> 2406.56
at some point because globe lies

2402.96 --> 2408.0
right so it's actually very wise of the

2406.56 --> 2410.319
article writer to just

2408.0 --> 2412.0
leave it to the observation and just

2410.319 --> 2415.44
like just leave it to

2412.0 --> 2419.28
the data just like here's the data right

2415.44 --> 2419.28
there's nothing wrong when it's data

2419.359 --> 2423.2799999999997
like what are they gonna take it down

2421.04 --> 2425.52
for for being data

2423.28 --> 2426.3190000000004
it has no opinion it's just sharing the

2425.52 --> 2430.56
data that's

2426.319 --> 2432.96
that's good it'll actually survive

2430.56 --> 2432.96
like that

2436.24 --> 2439.839
hey getting wisdom good to see you

2442.24 --> 2445.9199999999996
what is the link i can't have it on my

2444.4 --> 2449.599
3d

2445.92 --> 2449.599
he posted it in chat

2450.0 --> 2455.52
logan's run

2453.839 --> 2467.839
if you can't link it i can't help you

2455.52 --> 2467.839
with that sorry

2487.04 --> 2492.839
but what's it about it's an observation

2490.079 --> 2496.8
between two mountains

2492.839 --> 2499.52
india and china

2496.8 --> 2501.04
between two mountains of 200 kilometers

2499.52 --> 2504.16
in between

2501.04 --> 2504.56
and it's a rare sight apparently usually

2504.16 --> 2508.0789999999997
it's

2504.56 --> 2509.2
too moist so you don't get to see the

2508.079 --> 2512.0
other mountains

2509.2 --> 2512.8799999999997
but it was a rare clear day so that

2512.0 --> 2515.92
there was

2512.88 --> 2518.079
photographs from one mountain

2515.92 --> 2519.119
seeing the other that's what the article

2518.079 --> 2523.8390000000004
is about

2519.119 --> 2523.839
logan's run

2558.93 --> 2561.94
[Music]

2562.839 --> 2565.839
so

2571.92 --> 2581.28
right hey clutch bear

2579.359 --> 2582.4
oh notice how in the article it says the

2581.28 --> 2588.4
lockdown help this

2582.4 --> 2590.96
uh well clutchbear you know

2588.4 --> 2593.2000000000003
if it's technically correct it's correct

2590.96 --> 2595.839
right

2593.2 --> 2597.52
because if the lockdown for whatever

2595.839 --> 2602.319
damage is doing

2597.52 --> 2605.359
it causes it temporarily yeah

2602.319 --> 2606.72
a clearing up of the skies because of

2605.359 --> 2608.7999999999997
lower industry

2606.72 --> 2610.3999999999996
yes it's of course it's not going to be

2608.8 --> 2613.119
good for the people

2610.4 --> 2615.2000000000003
but it did technically provide that

2613.119 --> 2617.52
picture opportunity

2615.2 --> 2620.0
so if it's true it's true as long as

2617.52 --> 2622.48
it's not going to like praise

2620.0 --> 2624.4
the lock down too much as long as it's

2622.48 --> 2625.2
just established like yeah it's probably

2624.4 --> 2627.44
caused by that

2625.2 --> 2635.839
then what's the problem if it's true

2627.44 --> 2635.839
it's true

2646.839 --> 2649.839
well

2655.92 --> 2662.7200000000003
ah right stallion 8012 thank you

2660.16 --> 2663.2799999999997
i'm doing great i like i am doing great

2662.72 --> 2665.2799999999997
i

2663.28 --> 2667.44
paid off the debts that were like

2665.28 --> 2670.6400000000003
nagging me

2667.44 --> 2670.64
with minimal damage

2671.119 --> 2673.44
uh

2674.24 --> 2677.4399999999996
and yeah i feel like i'm in a recovery

2676.48 --> 2680.56
period right now

2677.44 --> 2680.56
so i'm eating well

2683.2 --> 2687.68
thinking more about girls than usual

2685.28 --> 2690.8
surprise surprise

2687.68 --> 2694.8799999999997
like the experiment in

2690.8 --> 2697.04
in south park what happens when you

2694.88 --> 2698.96
have just a regular monkey in a cage and

2697.04 --> 2700.56
then you give the monkey a really big

2698.96 --> 2702.319
pile of cash and then suddenly the

2700.56 --> 2704.0
monkey goes all nuts and starts to have

2702.319 --> 2706.56
sex with all the women right

2704.0 --> 2708.48
that episode maybe that's absolutely

2706.56 --> 2712.0789999999997
that

2708.48 --> 2714.079
but i'm not gonna kid myself like

2712.079 --> 2717.52
just because there's like a temporary

2714.079 --> 2719.8390000000004
recovery doesn't mean that i'm now

2717.52 --> 2722.079
that i have the room to go all nuts like

2719.839 --> 2724.88
that and i don't really want to i

2722.079 --> 2724.88
would shouldn't

2727.839 --> 2733.839
but i'm thinking more about women though

2738.64 --> 2742.8799999999997
and especially like yeah what should my

2741.119 --> 2746.88
composure be you know and that's

2742.88 --> 2749.839
been always been a tricky question cause

2746.88 --> 2752.119
in ways i really don't get how women or

2749.839 --> 2755.119
a lot of them

2752.119 --> 2755.119
prioritize

2755.359 --> 2760.319
like what they seek in others i i really

2758.319 --> 2763.04
don't get it sometimes

2760.319 --> 2765.839
like it totally blows my mind when i see

2763.04 --> 2765.839
sometimes like

2766.0 --> 2768.88
what they pick

2771.52 --> 2775.839
right so i'm puzzling about that a

2774.319 --> 2778.4
little

2775.839 --> 2780.16
but at the same time like i'm also just

2778.4 --> 2784.319
kind of dreaming into the distance like

2780.16 --> 2784.319
yeah i gotta find somebody that's just

2784.4 --> 2790.319
that could actually recognize the peak

2788.0 --> 2793.76
like the special skills i have and could

2790.319 --> 2797.04
do something with that or next to that

2793.76 --> 2800.6400000000003
so in a ways i really need a partner but

2797.04 --> 2803.2
that's weird like yeah oh oh a wizard

2800.64 --> 2804.96
like a good wizard oh let's just find a

2803.2 --> 2805.52
partner right there plenty of fish in

2804.96 --> 2809.04
the sea

2805.52 --> 2809.04
well i'm not looking for fish

2809.44 --> 2816.48
i'm looking for another wizard

2813.28 --> 2818.96
in her own way

2816.48 --> 2820.2400000000002
and those are tough to find and a lot of

2818.96 --> 2823.359
them

2820.24 --> 2823.359
have a lot of damage

2824.96 --> 2831.359
or they're like kind of evil or

2828.64 --> 2834.7999999999997
yeah the damage can cause you to be evil

2831.359 --> 2836.64
or to completely separate

2834.8 --> 2838.6400000000003
from the notion that you could ever have

2836.64 --> 2840.8799999999997
a real true bond

2838.64 --> 2842.48
and with the telepathy that comes with

2840.88 --> 2845.119
it right

2842.48 --> 2845.76
so i do get it but yeah it's not just

2845.119 --> 2847.6800000000003
like oh

2845.76 --> 2851.5200000000004
plenty of fish well i'm not looking for

2847.68 --> 2851.52
a fish unfortunately

2854.0 --> 2861.76
hey tony whitcomb

2858.16 --> 2866.16
yeah i'm doing great i'm doing all fine

2861.76 --> 2866.1600000000003
what about mermaids no

2869.52 --> 2875.04
yeah the thing is i don't really like

2872.079 --> 2875.04
the smell of fish

2878.559 --> 2884.8390000000004
right and mermaids they're since they're

2881.599 --> 2887.839
half fish they're probably gonna smell a

2884.839 --> 2887.839
fish

2898.079 --> 2902.0
make them laugh and feel safe be

2899.92 --> 2905.359
yourself well

2902.0 --> 2907.92
first i have to feel safe

2905.359 --> 2908.5589999999997
in order to be myself and then i will

2907.92 --> 2910.88
probably

2908.559 --> 2912.559
end up making them laugh like i am

2910.88 --> 2915.839
accidentally comed

2912.559 --> 2918.0
comedic right that's my thing is

2915.839 --> 2920.7999999999997
that doesn't work the other way like i'm

2918.0 --> 2923.68
not an active comedian like that

2920.8 --> 2925.8390000000004
but apparently apparently people say i'm

2923.68 --> 2930.0
funny

2925.839 --> 2932.48
it's just that i it's kind of part of my

2930.0 --> 2932.48
character

2934.48 --> 2941.119
it's not something i can really control

2937.68 --> 2945.1189999999997
i can play with it sometimes

2941.119 --> 2945.119
they don't have real control over it

2946.4 --> 2957.839
and i like to leave it spontaneous

2949.92 --> 2957.839
hey amanda young good to see you

2959.76 --> 2964.4
right but i've i've realized also like

2966.88 --> 2973.04
with any girl that i would be interested

2970.079 --> 2975.3590000000004
in the first thing i would ask and i and

2973.04 --> 2978.16
i kind of weirded out by the realization

2975.359 --> 2984.24
that this has become so important now

2978.16 --> 2988.7999999999997
so i would ask are you vaccinated

2984.24 --> 2988.7999999999997
yes oh okay

2989.2 --> 2992.319
we might be friends

2992.64 --> 2997.5989999999997
it's the truth i i'm not gonna i'm not

2995.92 --> 3000.559
gonna do

2997.599 --> 3001.3590000000004
a girl if they are like corona

3000.559 --> 3004.559
vaccinated

3001.359 --> 3007.5989999999997
and if they weren't and i'd be

3004.559 --> 3011.76
hard-pressed to ask them like will

3007.599 --> 3012.0
i hope you like really don't even want

3011.76 --> 3014.0
to

3012.0 --> 3016.559
and are going to avoid it pretty much at

3014.0 --> 3016.559
all cost

3019.599 --> 3027.839
out here it's going to be tough

3023.119 --> 3027.839
tough to find right

3037.76 --> 3042.0
right because there's gonna be probably

3040.24 --> 3044.8799999999997
plenty of girls that are just like yeah

3042.0 --> 3047.92
sure it's all free will do anything

3044.88 --> 3055.4700000000003
but at meantime they are like yeah

3047.92 --> 3057.359
getting vaccinated so that's

3055.47 --> 3059.5989999999997
[Music]

3057.359 --> 3062.0
and i feel a bit stupid even because i

3059.599 --> 3065.04
basically let it

3062.0 --> 3067.2
cause a division for myself

3065.04 --> 3069.44
but i should probably take that serious

3067.2 --> 3071.4399999999996
because if i'm gonna engage with a woman

3069.44 --> 3073.28
it's a great likelihood that i want to

3071.44 --> 3076.559
have children with them and if they're

3073.28 --> 3080.48
vaccinated i'm not gonna do that

3076.559 --> 3081.119
right i didn't do it and i need to find

3080.48 --> 3083.44
somebody

3081.119 --> 3086.4
that also didn't do it and that would

3083.44 --> 3086.4
like to have children

3086.96 --> 3089.2
but

3090.24 --> 3097.359
it'll still just have to work so

3093.68 --> 3101.359
yeah it's not unfortunately

3097.359 --> 3101.359
not many fishes for me out there

3108.079 --> 3112.4
hey amanda jung thank you for the super

3110.079 --> 3116.2400000000002
chat donation

3112.4 --> 3118.88
best flat earther am i the best thanks

3116.24 --> 3125.839
i appreciate the vote of confidence i do

3118.88 --> 3125.839
my best

3132.64 --> 3142.7999999999997
all right vaccine for the vague virus

3138.079 --> 3142.8
it's not even a vaccine it's just a

3143.52 --> 3146.4
like a wild

3146.64 --> 3153.5989999999997
genetic modification based

3150.16 --> 3157.7599999999998
medical experiment under the cover of

3153.599 --> 3160.0
a vaccine against a virus

3157.76 --> 3161.28
right so there is no virus there is no

3160.0 --> 3164.079
vaccine

3161.28 --> 3166.559
and it annoys me endlessly that still

3164.079 --> 3169.76
within media sources it's still

3166.559 --> 3171.599
kind of like yeah but but there is a

3169.76 --> 3175.0400000000004
virus

3171.599 --> 3179.52
no stop saying oh it's all

3175.04 --> 3182.88
fake but there is a virus no there isn't

3179.52 --> 3185.92
stop it it's all fake

3182.88 --> 3189.2000000000003
there is no virus that doesn't exist

3185.92 --> 3192.88
it's a faulty conception there's no

3189.2 --> 3196.319
actual medical proof that viruses

3192.88 --> 3197.04
according to the model associated with

3196.319 --> 3199.52
viruses

3197.04 --> 3201.7599999999998
actually exists yeah you can have

3199.52 --> 3203.7599999999998
conditions and yeah there are exosomes

3201.76 --> 3207.3590000000004
in your body and they do stuff

3203.76 --> 3210.88
it's part of your body it doesn't invade

3207.359 --> 3213.5989999999997
all of that is pure nonsense it's all

3210.88 --> 3214.96
lies there's no proof that that works

3213.599 --> 3218.319
with any of it

3214.96 --> 3224.2400000000002
any of the viruses it's

3218.319 --> 3224.24
it's really pretty extreme it is

3224.72 --> 3231.839
a very big element that's

3228.16 --> 3234.96
falsely borrowed itself into

3231.839 --> 3236.48
culture to think that that's real it's

3234.96 --> 3239.04
been indoctrinated

3236.48 --> 3239.8
into us to think that that's real just

3239.04 --> 3243.2
like

3239.8 --> 3243.92
astrophysics has been conceived purely

3243.2 --> 3247.359
to make us

3243.92 --> 3250.8
imagine how their universe

3247.359 --> 3252.7999999999997
model has some legitimacy

3250.8 --> 3254.4
it's kind of the same thing except the

3252.8 --> 3257.52
implications for the

3254.4 --> 3260.64
medical fiction of viruses

3257.52 --> 3264.24
is extremely dire and is being used to

3260.64 --> 3268.48
engineer deadly setups for people

3264.24 --> 3268.4799999999996
and and mind control them right now so

3269.04 --> 3272.48
germ theory is not a scientific yes it

3270.88 --> 3276.7200000000003
is moth ice

3272.48 --> 3279.76
yes it is germ theory is scientific

3276.72 --> 3283.1189999999997
it's about germs germs bacteria

3279.76 --> 3286.1600000000003
bacteria real things viruses

3283.119 --> 3289.76
not real things faulty

3286.16 --> 3293.839
model non-living matter generated

3289.76 --> 3293.8390000000004
in the body with a specific function

3296.96 --> 3304.16
oh hey thank you mandio so

3300.16 --> 3304.8799999999997
no germ theory is absolutely scientific

3304.16 --> 3308.799
theory

3304.88 --> 3311.839
it is it's just that

3308.799 --> 3314.64
it's experiment based

3311.839 --> 3315.2
it's just very confined because there

3314.64 --> 3318.319
are

3315.2 --> 3320.319
a lot of influences that are very

3318.319 --> 3323.359
difficult to isolate that weren't

3320.319 --> 3326.88
discovered yet at that time

3323.359 --> 3329.839
not in a scientific way they have been

3326.88 --> 3332.2400000000002
in the meantime they weren't back then

3329.839 --> 3336.0
right the terrain theory

3332.24 --> 3338.9599999999996
is very viable and scientific

3336.0 --> 3340.16
too it is scientific you can actually

3338.96 --> 3342.7200000000003
test that

3340.16 --> 3342.72
medically

3343.68 --> 3347.5989999999997
right but just because one theory has a

3346.72 --> 3351.839
different approach

3347.599 --> 3351.839
doesn't nullify the other one

3356.799 --> 3360.96
germ theory says germs make us ill it's

3359.359 --> 3364.64
not proven yes it is

3360.96 --> 3367.2
mouth is yes it is that's incorrect

3364.64 --> 3369.2
germs theory says germs make us ill well

3367.2 --> 3372.24
they do

3369.2 --> 3373.359
but it's not germs in general it's so it

3372.24 --> 3376.4799999999996
was even then

3373.359 --> 3379.04
specific germs right and

3376.48 --> 3379.92
under certain conditions and if your

3379.04 --> 3383.2
body is

3379.92 --> 3385.28
very strong if you're

3383.2 --> 3387.2
full of vitamin c and all that and

3385.28 --> 3390.6400000000003
you're just very healthy then

3387.2 --> 3394.72
those germs who would absolutely

3390.64 --> 3396.72
infect you they don't have a chance

3394.72 --> 3398.48
they don't survive and this is what

3396.72 --> 3400.64
terrain theory

3398.48 --> 3401.839
explains how that works how your

3400.64 --> 3403.839
condition

3401.839 --> 3406.0789999999997
and your and the influence from your

3403.839 --> 3408.88
environment on the condition

3406.079 --> 3409.8390000000004
is it is a very important factor

3408.88 --> 3412.799
basically to

3409.839 --> 3414.24
how germ theory works because it does

3412.799 --> 3418.4
work bacteria can

3414.24 --> 3421.9199999999996
absolutely be hostile right it's

3418.4 --> 3425.119
it's a society of microorganisms

3421.92 --> 3428.559
and if you're not balanced well if your

3425.119 --> 3432.0
your your flora

3428.559 --> 3434.96
is not up to date is not

3432.0 --> 3435.68
working well there's problems that then

3434.96 --> 3437.92
you're

3435.68 --> 3438.96
effectively as they say your immunity

3437.92 --> 3441.44
goes down

3438.96 --> 3442.96
and then you do become susceptible to

3441.44 --> 3446.2400000000002
infection it's just a fact

3442.96 --> 3447.359
it's a medical fact scientific so germ

3446.24 --> 3451.04
theory definitely

3447.359 --> 3452.64
does work it's just that there are other

3451.04 --> 3454.5589999999997
factors as well

3452.64 --> 3456.24
right and germ theory doesn't prove

3454.559 --> 3459.599
viruses at all

3456.24 --> 3462.8799999999997
viruses are a conception based

3459.599 --> 3466.079
on germ theory but it's

3462.88 --> 3470.319
fictional that's not actually real

3466.079 --> 3471.6800000000003
but germs bacteria specifically bacteria

3470.319 --> 3474.88
of different types

3471.68 --> 3475.2799999999997
and larger organisms parasites they are

3474.88 --> 3478.0
real

3475.28 --> 3481.3590000000004
and they definitely do what they've been

3478.0 --> 3481.359
medically proven to do

3481.52 --> 3483.68
so

3484.72 --> 3491.68
yeah don't mistake

3489.119 --> 3494.0
don't make that mistake germ theory is

3491.68 --> 3494.0
real

3498.64 --> 3504.799
explain the flora oh by the way yeah

3500.96 --> 3504.799
thank you amanda young for the paypal

3509.76 --> 3516.88
well the flora are the bacteria

3512.799 --> 3519.839
in your body that your body cultivates

3516.88 --> 3522.0
and uses for optimal functioning because

3519.839 --> 3524.0789999999997
there's a lot of different bacteria in

3522.0 --> 3529.92
your body

3524.079 --> 3531.6800000000003
that are there on that are cherished

3529.92 --> 3535.119
they're like

3531.68 --> 3537.44
like how a farmer has animals right

3535.119 --> 3538.559
all these animals in the wild can do

3537.44 --> 3540.319
damage

3538.559 --> 3541.6800000000003
they can [ __ ] all over the place they

3540.319 --> 3545.2
can rough things up

3541.68 --> 3548.3999999999996
whatever can attack you but

3545.2 --> 3551.04
inside of the farm in you

3548.4 --> 3552.96
they are tamed they are functioning they

3551.04 --> 3556.4
are actually providing benefit

3552.96 --> 3561.359
they give you milk as the comparison

3556.4 --> 3564.079
for example all that right good bacteria

3561.359 --> 3564.72
right but even good bacteria can become

3564.079 --> 3567.28
bad

3564.72 --> 3569.04
because bacteria a lot of them they

3567.28 --> 3571.2000000000003
develop they adapt

3569.04 --> 3573.119
to their environment their own little

3571.2 --> 3575.5989999999997
terrain theory

3573.119 --> 3576.1600000000003
right terrain theory applies to bacteria

3575.599 --> 3579.599
so

3576.16 --> 3581.2
bacteria can become incredibly hostile

3579.599 --> 3583.44
when subjected to a poisonous

3581.2 --> 3584.24
environment and then when they adapt to

3583.44 --> 3586.64
that

3584.24 --> 3587.9199999999996
if they're like reintroduced then

3586.64 --> 3591.1189999999997
suddenly they become

3587.92 --> 3592.799
very dangerous to your body

3591.119 --> 3595.04
right they become invaders when

3592.799 --> 3597.68
originally they might have been

3595.04 --> 3598.319
like gut bacteria that were good for you

3597.68 --> 3601.68
like

3598.319 --> 3604.5589999999997
that's because of terrain theory

3601.68 --> 3606.96
that yeah that they adapt and can become

3604.559 --> 3606.96
different

3607.28 --> 3612.96
right but yes

3610.64 --> 3614.24
your body has a lot of bacteria on your

3612.96 --> 3616.16
skin in your guts

3614.24 --> 3618.3999999999996
and they're essential they're critical

3616.16 --> 3622.0
to

3618.4 --> 3625.28
your body's defense even to

3622.0 --> 3628.319
considerably promote healing

3625.28 --> 3631.6800000000003
right some of the bacteria on your skin

3628.319 --> 3632.319
they attack other bacteria that might

3631.68 --> 3635.44
attack

3632.319 --> 3638.5589999999997
your flesh that's what yeah

3635.44 --> 3640.48
it's it's incredible

3638.559 --> 3642.88
and that's also why you shouldn't

3640.48 --> 3643.92
constantly squirt freaking alcohol on

3642.88 --> 3646.1600000000003
your hands

3643.92 --> 3647.2000000000003
because it will help against your virus

3646.16 --> 3651.2799999999997
it doesn't

3647.2 --> 3653.9199999999996
like even theoretically it doesn't right

3651.28 --> 3655.599
the alcohol doesn't help against that

3653.92 --> 3657.44
part it doesn't do anything with it

3655.599 --> 3661.2000000000003
right it should supposedly

3657.44 --> 3663.359
kill bad bacteria right against that it

3661.2 --> 3665.2799999999997
does work but it's bacteria it's a it's

3663.359 --> 3668.839
supposed to be a virus it

3665.28 --> 3671.0400000000004
alco doesn't even work like that it's

3668.839 --> 3673.7599999999998
ridiculous

3671.04 --> 3675.52
and what it does do however is if you

3673.76 --> 3675.92
constantly squirt that [ __ ] on your

3675.52 --> 3679.28
hands

3675.92 --> 3682.079
it's going to damage those good bacteria

3679.28 --> 3684.799
that assist you in keeping the bad

3682.079 --> 3687.92
bacteria out right

3684.799 --> 3689.44
so don't do that like when you squirt

3687.92 --> 3690.96
alcohol in your hands

3689.44 --> 3692.88
you better have a good reason for it

3690.96 --> 3695.92
like you just did some

3692.88 --> 3697.2000000000003
really dirty [ __ ] with that like literal

3695.92 --> 3700.559
[ __ ] or whatever

3697.2 --> 3703.359
you know clean out the stables yeah

3700.559 --> 3705.92
after that you might want to hash wash

3703.359 --> 3708.48
with soap and maybe even alcohol

3705.92 --> 3710.2400000000002
because there is potentially a lot of

3708.48 --> 3712.799
the hostile bacteria

3710.24 --> 3715.2799999999997
present and that's when you do want to

3712.799 --> 3717.599
squirt it with alcohol right

3715.28 --> 3718.6400000000003
when there's actual bacteria infection

3717.599 --> 3722.079
risk

3718.64 --> 3726.48
but if you're just going about

3722.079 --> 3729.599
shopping or whatever touching doors or

3726.48 --> 3731.839
shopping carts it's ridiculous

3729.599 --> 3734.319
every time you do that you literally

3731.839 --> 3737.68
make yourself more vulnerable

3734.319 --> 3739.7599999999998
to bacteria that might be going around

3737.68 --> 3741.52
that normally you could easily handle

3739.76 --> 3742.1600000000003
but if you constantly squirt alcohol in

3741.52 --> 3745.52
your hands

3742.16 --> 3749.1189999999997
then suddenly you do become susceptible

3745.52 --> 3750.48
because of terrain theory because of the

3749.119 --> 3753.599
influences

3750.48 --> 3757.119
of the terrain see

3753.599 --> 3760.2400000000002
so germ theory

3757.119 --> 3764.1600000000003
terrain theory they're two

3760.24 --> 3768.3999999999996
hands on a body both

3764.16 --> 3772.799
exist both are viable and they

3768.4 --> 3775.2000000000003
overlap when you really think about it

3772.799 --> 3776.96
one does not exclude the other one does

3775.2 --> 3780.0
not replace the other they're just

3776.96 --> 3780.0
both there

3781.039 --> 3783.8390000000004
right

3788.48 --> 3792.0
right the more we sanitize the weaker we

3790.24 --> 3794.24
get and that's not just for

3792.0 --> 3795.68
squirting on your hands with alcohol

3794.24 --> 3798.9599999999996
it's also for

3795.68 --> 3800.48
showering like if you shower every day

3798.96 --> 3803.039
or twice a day

3800.48 --> 3803.599
that's not gonna be good for your body

3803.039 --> 3806.0
your

3803.599 --> 3808.079
flora on your skin that's your defense

3806.0 --> 3810.4
system is gonna have a hard time

3808.079 --> 3812.88
constantly recovering from that

3810.4 --> 3816.2400000000002
and might actually adapt to the cleaning

3812.88 --> 3816.2400000000002
toxins making them

3816.559 --> 3823.28
well more aggressive

3820.96 --> 3825.359
right you can literally damage your

3823.28 --> 3827.039
flora of your skin if you just wash it

3825.359 --> 3829.2799999999997
too much

3827.039 --> 3831.039
also every time you do that you shower

3829.28 --> 3834.2400000000002
and you take soap and all that

3831.039 --> 3836.2400000000002
you also with it drain the fat

3834.24 --> 3838.64
from your skin and fat is a very

3836.24 --> 3839.68
important component to your skin

3838.64 --> 3843.1189999999997
survival for

3839.68 --> 3845.44
all kinds of conditions right

3843.119 --> 3847.119
so if you constantly wash yourself

3845.44 --> 3848.88
shower twice a day

3847.119 --> 3851.119
your body is going to have a hard time

3848.88 --> 3854.0
replenishing those fats

3851.119 --> 3855.52
it's gonna work have to work harder you

3854.0 --> 3860.96
yeah

3855.52 --> 3863.599
so i don't shower on a daily basis

3860.96 --> 3864.2400000000002
i do wash my feet though because there's

3863.599 --> 3866.559
still

3864.24 --> 3868.9599999999996
the need for the body besides the

3866.559 --> 3870.559
kidneys to get rid of certain types of

3868.96 --> 3874.559
toxins

3870.559 --> 3877.92
and i learned that if you wash your feet

3874.559 --> 3881.52
every day then your body will

3877.92 --> 3883.28
take that as okay that spot is washed

3881.52 --> 3885.92
every day like that

3883.28 --> 3887.119
that's where we're gonna dump the toxins

3885.92 --> 3890.319
because that way

3887.119 --> 3893.6800000000003
we can do some of that toxin dumping

3890.319 --> 3894.5589999999997
over there right so if i don't wash my

3893.68 --> 3897.5989999999997
feet

3894.559 --> 3900.079
a day or two days it's gonna get weird

3897.599 --> 3902.079
like it's gonna get stinky and i'm gonna

3900.079 --> 3904.799
feel unwell

3902.079 --> 3907.6800000000003
but it's because i conditioned my body

3904.799 --> 3909.359
to basically

3907.68 --> 3910.8799999999997
know that it's going to be washed in a

3909.359 --> 3915.92
very specific place

3910.88 --> 3919.039
so it starts to dump the toxins there

3915.92 --> 3923.52
right i yeah i

3919.039 --> 3926.559
learned this 15 years ago or more

3923.52 --> 3926.559
i figured this out

3930.799 --> 3936.4
no no hair down now i am actually gonna

3933.599 --> 3939.76
take a shower later today

3936.4 --> 3941.52
because it's just too fat it'll look

3939.76 --> 3944.88
really stupid

3941.52 --> 3946.079
or sloppy dirty so i'm just gonna do it

3944.88 --> 3951.839
this show like this

3946.079 --> 3951.8390000000004
it's just fine

3959.76 --> 3965.8390000000004
chrome first is [ __ ] iron 26 it's

3963.039 --> 3965.8390000000004
all [ __ ]

3983.119 --> 3993.839
all right

4004.839 --> 4010.48
oh

4006.96 --> 4021.119
seems like we've got a jackdaw

4010.48 --> 4024.48
territorial struggle over there

4021.119 --> 4026.1600000000003
oh he did mention washing feet several

4024.48 --> 4029.92
times in the world oh that's good

4026.16 --> 4029.92
servant bro

4030.24 --> 4036.4799999999996
i'm embarrassed to say i didn't even

4031.839 --> 4039.92
know that that's amazing

4036.48 --> 4041.039
i had no idea back then or maybe it kind

4039.92 --> 4044.88
of slipped by

4041.039 --> 4047.119
and i took it but it didn't even like

4044.88 --> 4048.7200000000003
relate it to jesus back then it's just

4047.119 --> 4051.76
amazing

4048.72 --> 4054.16
i i do that i learned that a long time

4051.76 --> 4054.1600000000003
ago

4054.24 --> 4057.52
it's like okay

4057.599 --> 4062.96
take away the chemicals from deodorants

4060.559 --> 4066.4
i don't use those

4062.96 --> 4069.599
be careful with like the soaps

4066.4 --> 4072.7200000000003
and all that

4069.599 --> 4076.1600000000003
then i went eating organic

4072.72 --> 4079.9199999999996
quickly after and that's

4076.16 --> 4085.0389999999998
really transformed me in many ways

4079.92 --> 4087.52
i still had a lot of psychological

4085.039 --> 4088.1600000000003
damage control and maintenance to

4087.52 --> 4089.92
perform

4088.16 --> 4091.92
which has taken me pretty much two

4089.92 --> 4095.76
decades

4091.92 --> 4098.319
but my physical health i was quick

4095.76 --> 4099.12
to get there to get it to get it take it

4098.319 --> 4101.6
serious

4099.12 --> 4103.679
to really take control outside of what

4101.6 --> 4119.1990000000005
any freaking doctor would say

4103.679 --> 4123.04
that started like 20 years ago

4119.199 --> 4123.04
you wash this apostles feed

4131.679 --> 4137.12
well it i've had my feet washed

4134.799 --> 4139.5199999999995
like by my ex-girlfriend and it is

4137.12 --> 4147.839
pretty amazing experience

4139.52 --> 4147.839000000001
really it's very sensitive

4158.839 --> 4161.839
anyway

4175.92 --> 4189.839
huh all right moth eyes

4179.199 --> 4189.839
well yeah

4191.44 --> 4195.04
instructed them to wash each other's

4193.359 --> 4197.679
feet that's

4195.04 --> 4197.679
wow okay

4198.8 --> 4203.84
that's very intimate though

4225.28 --> 4229.599999999999
contested three times a week jesus moth

4228.159 --> 4233.28
eyes

4229.6 --> 4245.84
that sucks you really have to go along

4233.28 --> 4245.84
with that crap

4256.84 --> 4259.84
huh

4271.12 --> 4274.719
well gaining wisdom you know it's very

4273.36 --> 4279.12
tricky

4274.719 --> 4282.56
because of the true nature of

4279.12 --> 4285.599999999999
like the virus condition right

4282.56 --> 4286.4800000000005
like like when people say oh the virus

4285.6 --> 4288.56
is gonna

4286.48 --> 4290.0
infect you and say no no it's not a

4288.56 --> 4292.56
virus that infects you

4290.0 --> 4293.92
it's a condition like covet is a

4292.56 --> 4297.280000000001
condition

4293.92 --> 4299.1990000000005
your body can enter and it's not because

4297.28 --> 4302.32
of infection it's because of

4299.199 --> 4303.36
well terrain theory influences that you

4302.32 --> 4306.4
might

4303.36 --> 4306.4
get that condition

4310.159 --> 4315.679
so yeah if there's antiviral soaps

4313.52 --> 4318.080000000001
that could actually mean something else

4315.679 --> 4321.28
that could mean okay this soap

4318.08 --> 4324.4
what it does is typically

4321.28 --> 4328.8
cause a balance in your body

4324.4 --> 4332.5599999999995
in order to not go to the virus

4328.8 --> 4335.4400000000005
the exosomes to that condition to avoid

4332.56 --> 4335.84
that condition from happening right it

4335.44 --> 4338.5599999999995
could

4335.84 --> 4338.56
mean that

4340.4 --> 4344.48
and then yeah then it's like oh well if

4342.4 --> 4347.28
it actually does that

4344.48 --> 4349.36
well then it can talk about viruses that

4347.28 --> 4349.84
it kills that's nonsense but if it'll

4349.36 --> 4352.88
actually

4349.84 --> 4355.12
help prevent like

4352.88 --> 4357.52
a covert condition or any type of

4355.12 --> 4360.159
condition associated with virus

4357.52 --> 4360.56
well then it's still doing its job it's

4360.159 --> 4364.159
just

4360.56 --> 4371.84
using a faulty model to sell itself

4364.159 --> 4371.839999999999
right it's really tricky like that

4382.84 --> 4385.84
do

4396.84 --> 4399.84
uh

4410.84 --> 4413.84
oh

4422.32 --> 4427.84
i don't know lfd either what is that

4467.679 --> 4469.84
right

4476.48 --> 4480.239
like a pregnancy test oh really

4480.84 --> 4483.84
okay

4487.199 --> 4493.759999999999
that's so ridiculous though right it's

4490.239 --> 4496.799999999999
it it's just like overkill

4493.76 --> 4497.679
drug testing right you have to use piss

4496.8 --> 4500.4800000000005
as well

4497.679 --> 4501.84
it's like it's just the same [ __ ] again

4500.48 --> 4506.0
just making you

4501.84 --> 4508.400000000001
do these tests overkill

4506.0 --> 4510.08
because i with cert i remember that at

4508.4 --> 4512.719
certain periods in america

4510.08 --> 4515.28
especially that you like had to do a

4512.719 --> 4517.44
freaking drug test like

4515.28 --> 4519.759999999999
every few days or something with certain

4517.44 --> 4519.759999999999
jobs

4522.56 --> 4526.56
i i got it from the tv though so i don't

4526.159 --> 4528.96
know

4526.56 --> 4530.719
how true that really was how universal

4528.96 --> 4533.199
that was

4530.719 --> 4535.679
but it just sounds like the same thing

4533.199 --> 4538.08
like oh you have to take this test

4535.679 --> 4539.28
this is oh my god imagine that it might

4538.08 --> 4541.04
be

4539.28 --> 4542.88
that you might have that thing or

4541.04 --> 4545.92
something one time and

4542.88 --> 4548.96
yeah first back then

4545.92 --> 4551.6
drug tests overkill like

4548.96 --> 4553.04
could you imagine that you might have

4551.6 --> 4555.679
sniffed

4553.04 --> 4557.6
some puff of marijuana once or something

4555.679 --> 4561.6
oh my god

4557.6 --> 4566.400000000001
you're fired or and now it's like oh

4561.6 --> 4570.159000000001
covet tests all the time

4566.4 --> 4570.159
how much difference is there really

4571.679 --> 4581.84
it's just control freak processes

4592.84 --> 4595.84
hmm

4604.64 --> 4608.0
now that's very wise moth eyes because

4606.48 --> 4611.36
there's probably some things wrong

4608.0 --> 4613.28
with the swabs i've saw that there's

4611.36 --> 4616.0
just weird stuff going on with the

4613.28 --> 4620.4
materials of that

4616.0 --> 4623.04
oh seeking star wars paypal oh

4620.4 --> 4624.0
i was going gonna round out the show but

4623.04 --> 4636.64
definitely gonna

4624.0 --> 4641.679
check that out

4636.64 --> 4641.679
whoa thank you very much

4641.92 --> 4651.84
wow that's that's quite some

4646.48 --> 4651.839999999999
thank you very much seeking star water

4657.04 --> 4660.48
i thank you a lot

4662.719 --> 4667.84
it's more about creating cases yeah

4668.239 --> 4675.04
man thank you all thank all of you guys

4671.12 --> 4675.04
for all the support this is so awesome

4676.08 --> 4679.92
first a huge paypal donation from will

4679.28 --> 4683.599999999999
williams

4679.92 --> 4685.84
and now still i'm getting from you guys

4683.6 --> 4688.0
i really appreciate it's

4685.84 --> 4688.0
like

4690.0 --> 4693.84
good times

4696.159 --> 4700.879999999999
thank you so much for the vote of

4698.159 --> 4703.04
confidence and the support

4700.88 --> 4704.88
and thanks for all the activity today

4703.04 --> 4706.56
guys you've been very active in chat i

4704.88 --> 4708.719
really appreciate that

4706.56 --> 4710.64
i hope you like the subjects i talked

4708.719 --> 4712.32
about

4710.64 --> 4714.2390000000005
maybe brought some clarity here and

4712.32 --> 4715.679
there because yeah everything is so

4714.239 --> 4717.839999999999
convoluted with

4715.679 --> 4719.04
what's being pumped out there in media

4717.84 --> 4722.96
world

4719.04 --> 4724.719
and even by people in reflection of what

4722.96 --> 4727.84
happens with media world right

4724.719 --> 4732.56
it all becomes kind of chaotic

4727.84 --> 4735.92
so i really am doing my best to kind of

4732.56 --> 4739.1990000000005
glance at that figure out

4735.92 --> 4741.4400000000005
what's going on why they do it and then

4739.199 --> 4744.4
try to find a proper balance to

4741.44 --> 4748.719
stabilize

4744.4 --> 4750.96
just how you can look at it

4748.719 --> 4753.28
and i hope i brought some clarity today

4750.96 --> 4756.88
again by bringing up the

4753.28 --> 4760.5599999999995
yeah the the balance between

4756.88 --> 4764.2390000000005
germ theory and terrain theory that both

4760.56 --> 4767.679
are scientific and they absolutely

4764.239 --> 4769.44
go hand in hand like two hands of the

4767.679 --> 4771.92
same body

4769.44 --> 4774.639999999999
to really consider that and also like

4771.92 --> 4777.4400000000005
you should consider that because

4774.64 --> 4778.2390000000005
in medical world in like especially the

4777.44 --> 4781.5199999999995
micro

4778.239 --> 4782.959999999999
biology cosmology things are never that

4781.52 --> 4786.080000000001
simple

4782.96 --> 4787.679
right so you can't just say oh it's this

4786.08 --> 4789.44
and then everything is going to be

4787.679 --> 4791.4400000000005
formulated through that train of

4789.44 --> 4792.48
thinking and those structures no that's

4791.44 --> 4794.96
going to be wrong

4792.48 --> 4797.759999999999
because microbiology is just very

4794.96 --> 4797.76
complicated

4798.08 --> 4803.5199999999995
and it takes a lot of work to really get

4801.84 --> 4806.2390000000005
a good understanding

4803.52 --> 4807.040000000001
because it's yeah it's like it's own

4806.239 --> 4811.04
micro

4807.04 --> 4814.96
cosmos every person every organism

4811.04 --> 4817.36
is like a giant country

4814.96 --> 4818.0
filled of activity and processes and

4817.36 --> 4821.28
it's really

4818.0 --> 4824.719
complicated and and detailed

4821.28 --> 4828.639
with lots of procedures all built in

4824.719 --> 4832.2390000000005
the design by god

4828.639 --> 4834.56
anyway i'm rounding out the show

4832.239 --> 4836.879999999999
looping arwen yeah yeah well that's the

4834.56 --> 4839.92
realm potentially

4836.88 --> 4842.159000000001
right can't guarantee the earth is

4839.92 --> 4845.12
rectangular looping

4842.159 --> 4846.48
but i certainly do see it as a viable

4845.12 --> 4848.96
possibility

4846.48 --> 4851.28
in the face of all the information that

4848.96 --> 4854.639
has been gathered so far

4851.28 --> 4855.759999999999
anyway thanks everyone for coming i hope
