6.35 --> 36.42
[Music]

39.31 --> 46.489000000000004
good morning welcome to flatter the

43.22 --> 47.81
earlybird number 260 I'm your host

46.489 --> 49.73
Arwen and before we start the show

47.81 --> 52.43
please don't forget to share it on any

49.73 --> 53.809
platform you deem fit also if you

52.43 --> 55.46
haven't already subscribed to my channel

53.809 --> 57.019999999999996
and hit the bell notification so you

55.46 --> 59.15
know when I'm going live which is

57.02 --> 62.480000000000004
normally 2:00 p.m. Amsterdam time and

59.15 --> 64.42999999999999
every day so please also support me

62.48 --> 67.96
through the super chats especially

64.43 --> 72.71000000000001
PayPal and also patreon and my GoFundMe

67.96 --> 74.47999999999999
much obliged good to see you all so the

72.71 --> 79.00999999999999
weather today is different I got a

74.48 --> 82.4
t-shirt on for starters and there's been

79.01 --> 86.9
some rain it's still kind of warm though

82.4 --> 91.49000000000001
very moist but not as warm as previous

86.9 --> 95.42
few days and yeah just when I went out

91.49 --> 98.75
for shopping I just managed to avoid

95.42 --> 102.71000000000001
going through a giant bucket of water

98.75 --> 105.41
being dropped down basically so there's

102.71 --> 109.91
some heavy rain going on as well big

105.41 --> 113.0
grey clouds here there but I'd still

109.91 --> 117.64999999999999
it's still nice so today I got with me

113.0 --> 122.33
Tamara coffee and actual Illuminati

117.65 --> 124.19000000000001
Castle some other goodies but I'm not

122.33 --> 127.88
sure if I'm going to eat it I got a I

124.19 --> 132.23
got a chocolate brownie and still piece

127.88 --> 135.26
of Sandwich left over and I got tea for

132.23 --> 142.60999999999999
a change because I really felt like it I

135.26 --> 147.73899999999998
really need some tea so today with me I

142.61 --> 150.8
will probably be joined by the Flat

147.739 --> 152.84
Earth debate team as you call them and

150.8 --> 157.22
if they're still hanging uh they seem to

152.84 --> 160.61
end it call that's too bad well I'll

157.22 --> 165.319
just roughly call them up again yeah

160.61 --> 167.79000000000002
that was me Nathan ran tea and

165.319 --> 171.14999999999998
Riley we're on a Skype call a little bit

167.79 --> 175.41
earlier talking about some plans for the

171.15 --> 179.519
future and while they were supposed to

175.41 --> 181.56
come on after like 10 to 2 15 20 minutes

179.519 --> 182.97
maybe but they hung up on the call so

181.56 --> 186.63
I'll just call them back when I feel

182.97 --> 196.29
like it but first let's just do go

186.63 --> 200.269
through the day and the chat so yeah I

196.29 --> 205.5
started up the the Hangout pretty late

200.269 --> 209.04000000000002
ten minutes before but at least Obama

205.5 --> 214.98
calls their righteous force I am Jason

209.04 --> 218.64
McCormack Amanda young oh yeah right

214.98 --> 228.08999999999997
yeah Jason no Mathias the walking

218.64 --> 231.01899999999998
witness I use youth michael roark I

228.09 --> 234.66
killed the hope good to see you

231.019 --> 237.06
so yeah yesterday debates were were a

234.66 --> 240.06
blast I was very active all throughout

237.06 --> 244.35
and was interesting first it was spruce

240.06 --> 247.35
chemo yeah well you know how that goes

244.35 --> 249.269
and eventually I started to go all

247.35 --> 252.12
Crowley in the background because I just

249.269 --> 254.37
couldn't see the guys was just he was

252.12 --> 257.519
just gonna brand that hill so I

254.37 --> 261.06
literally sniped him out after a long

257.519 --> 263.61
time and we proceeded to have a

261.06 --> 266.82
fantastic hangout after that

263.61 --> 270.3
Adam II can join we had this really good

266.82 --> 277.5
discussion I really liked it and from it

270.3 --> 281.93
came plans for a balloon test like a

277.5 --> 285.15
very wide broad spectrum analysis test

281.93 --> 288.78000000000003
temperature pressure electrostatic

285.15 --> 290.789
tension view very important needs to be

288.78 --> 294.05999999999995
a good camera on there to see if there

290.789 --> 296.76
is an apparent Sun visible at that

294.06 --> 299.1
height all these things an end and of

296.76 --> 304.02
course my special valve

299.1 --> 307.08000000000004
for the balloon when it hits the the

304.02 --> 308.90999999999997
slightly higher temperature zone and

307.08 --> 312.93
risks to yet

308.91 --> 317.55
explode because because of the the too

312.93 --> 319.89
rapid volume increase so put a valve on

317.55 --> 322.35
it and can go further potentially so

319.89 --> 325.14
yeah all these plants all these design

322.35 --> 328.56
plans for a very advanced balloon launch

325.14 --> 330.81
are now established and whether that's

328.56 --> 333.15
going to come to some kind of practical

330.81 --> 337.31
result I don't know but the idea is here

333.15 --> 340.97999999999996
and maybe this will take a another

337.31 --> 342.81
concerted effort with a GoFundMe with a

340.98 --> 344.40000000000003
wider group to get this done because I

342.81 --> 347.37
really want to check this out

344.4 --> 350.25
I really want to know this data and I

347.37 --> 358.22
think everybody does so that was great

350.25 --> 367.11
great debates yesterday and a good time

358.22 --> 372.32000000000005
had some wine just like a ham and Owen

367.11 --> 376.74
Benjamin was great also so yesterday was

372.32 --> 379.94
pretty much watching video all day until

376.74 --> 379.94
the night

385.06 --> 393.19
all right Maya lift a veil had another

388.24 --> 400.3
interesting piece mixed piece also about

393.19 --> 406.6
geoengineering and I was shocked to hear

400.3 --> 409.03000000000003
that apparently chemtrails don't yeah

406.6 --> 414.43
they they now use a different substance

409.03 --> 416.91999999999996
apparently no they uses different

414.43 --> 430.11
substance it was said they were what was

416.92 --> 430.11
it again I typed it out in in Skype yep

430.14 --> 437.58
yes if you look at the video at off you

435.76 --> 442.12
know I'll just put out the link here

437.58 --> 444.96999999999997
panel if you check out his video roughly

442.12 --> 446.8
after one hour and nine minutes he

444.97 --> 450.43
starts to talk about geoengineering and

446.8 --> 452.89
it's really good I really recommend that

450.43 --> 456.19
you watch this it's not too long it's

452.89 --> 463.63
maybe twenty minutes at most this is

456.19 --> 467.02
interesting stuff because yeah it's

463.63 --> 468.94
about geoengineering project from the

467.02 --> 474.21999999999997
Harvard University of Cambridge I think

468.94 --> 476.89
a geoengineering project where they will

474.22 --> 479.62
use not barium salts in aluminium

476.89 --> 484.5
dioxide or anything no they will use

479.62 --> 488.23
release cars calcium carbonate particles

484.5 --> 495.48
from a steerable balloon 20 kilometers

488.23 --> 495.48
above so that's what they're gonna do

498.05 --> 504.229
it yeah I find it fascinating look I've

501.24 --> 507.139
said it many times before I'm not

504.229 --> 511.19
universally against the concept of

507.139 --> 513.269
climate management weather management

511.19 --> 515.3389999999999
through but you have sort of

513.269 --> 517.649
geoengineering but yeah geoengineering

515.339 --> 523.62
almost automatically implies completely

517.649 --> 525.66
changing the entire climate it's and

523.62 --> 527.279
then yeah a universal change you're

525.66 --> 529.35
trying to achieve but that's something

527.279 --> 531.509
we shouldn't do but a bit of climate

529.35 --> 532.62
control that I don't see any problem

531.509 --> 536.49
just as long as you don't poison

532.62 --> 546.839
everything as you do it so anyway that

536.49 --> 549.449
was interesting what else yeah new earth

546.839 --> 552.2090000000001
had a new video and got about more stone

549.449 --> 555.449
marks it's weird I really want to

552.209 --> 558.649
sometimes about these stone marks but

555.449 --> 563.7589999999999
yeah it's not a lot of progress really

558.649 --> 566.43
oh yeah Owen Benjamin had an Eric Dubay

563.759 --> 570.9490000000001
savanna a video from Eric Dubay

566.43 --> 570.949
followers it was really funny

575.26 --> 581.51
all right that's pretty much it I think

578.44 --> 584.639
so yeah had a good time

581.51 --> 584.639
[Music]

588.05 --> 591.2099999999999
[Music]

594.8 --> 604.02
well yeah unsold at 667 you may be on to

598.62 --> 606.41
something there look I think that his

604.02 --> 608.67
life streams with his chat are a great

606.41 --> 615.51
soundboard it's like a little

608.67 --> 617.43
preliminary testing I think that's kind

615.51 --> 620.9399999999999
of part of what he's doing so he's

617.43 --> 623.4599999999999
literally just producing then putting it

620.94 --> 625.6500000000001
out raw with this public and see how

623.46 --> 628.5400000000001
they all respond what the overall effect

625.65 --> 630.14
is and then later on can just

628.54 --> 632.52
[Music]

630.14 --> 634.58
remembering all the responses with the

632.52 --> 640.98
timings and all that and try to figure

634.58 --> 644.5200000000001
something out like a yeah a big comedy

640.98 --> 646.65
play with that or a play a stand-up

644.52 --> 649.8299999999999
routine that's just how he does it

646.65 --> 654.63
and it makes perfect sense to me

649.83 --> 659.1500000000001
you know what yeah he has a test

654.63 --> 661.95
audience for free hello by the way Rasta

659.15 --> 666.12
you say the garlic shooting is sketchy

661.95 --> 669.72
as hell okay if you say so be

666.12 --> 679.32
interesting to know why I haven't seen

669.72 --> 683.61
much about it all be wizards by playing

679.32 --> 689.12
anti wizard cult what are you talking

683.61 --> 689.12
about what you talking about Rasta

697.899 --> 703.91
yeah methey is the walking witness

700.369 --> 708.1700000000001
apparently somewhere in the u.s. there

703.91 --> 710.439
was a garlic festival like a like a

708.17 --> 713.0889999999999
Renaissance Fair type thing but

710.439 --> 715.569
surrounding garlic apparently it's like

713.089 --> 721.1890000000001
a food festival and apparently somebody

715.569 --> 725.329
went nuts with a gun and that's the

721.189 --> 726.4699999999999
garlic shooting it didn't it happened

725.329 --> 730.3589999999999
just a few days ago

726.47 --> 730.359
barely hearing anything about it

745.51 --> 750.16
yeah my first impulse in response to

747.76 --> 751.36
that is that the vampires who are pissed

750.16 --> 758.9399999999999
off

751.36 --> 761.41
[Music]

758.94 --> 763.6300000000001
hmm all right I get it

761.41 --> 766.75
Owen B performs a wizardry by playing

763.63 --> 771.48
anti wizardry Oh auntie wizardry it's

766.75 --> 776.35
dispelling the truth dispels illusions

771.48 --> 778.9
and illusions Mesmer trickery that is

776.35 --> 781.12
what Owen calls wizardry I think it's a

778.9 --> 783.91
bit over generalized I call it Mesmer

781.12 --> 788.65
but I get it wizardry is more widely

783.91 --> 792.31
understood and but ant I wish it's just

788.65 --> 802.63
dispelling it with with logos and yeah

792.31 --> 809.4699999999999
that's what he does oh really control

802.63 --> 812.17
that explain that to me explain but by

809.47 --> 815.77
those standards everything is controlled

812.17 --> 820.41
opposition it would simply be controlled

815.77 --> 820.41
from the outside I don't know

823.89 --> 826.43
it's

827.6 --> 836.779
Owen Benjamin is just not controlled he

833.029 --> 840.62
you could pretty much say that he has

836.779 --> 841.87
oppositional defiance disorder really

840.62 --> 846.38
strongly

841.87 --> 854.569
that's just immediately gonna go yeah do

846.38 --> 856.55
exactly the opposite so if you notice

854.569 --> 860.0889999999999
the open script button doesn't seem to

856.55 --> 860.75
work any videos anymore is it just me I

860.089 --> 869.5400000000001
don't know

860.75 --> 875.029
open script I never really checked that

869.54 --> 879.529
out yeah Matthias the walking witness

875.029 --> 882.079
maybe you can present some evidence for

879.529 --> 886.3389999999999
your claim of control opposition so

882.079 --> 888.7299999999999
showcase how Owen Benjamin is controlled

886.339 --> 892.7600000000001
that his opposition is pretty obvious so

888.73 --> 895.269
show me the control prove it to me prove

892.76 --> 895.269
your claim

901.19 --> 907.12
what what thing did he do that suggest

904.79 --> 918.3389999999999
to you that he was controlled that he's

907.12 --> 918.339
playing into the hands of an agenda go

925.59 --> 934.08
sorry unsalted 6x have you got to be

930.91 --> 938.52
[ __ ] me seriously

934.08 --> 938.5200000000001
you didn't even watch it did you

944.529 --> 951.969
now no meth eyes the walking witness

947.889 --> 955.929
no I didn't claim that I set by that

951.969 --> 960.3090000000001
standard everything is controlled

955.929 --> 965.169
that's not my claim I'm saying that if

960.309 --> 968.1089999999999
you claim that then everything must be

965.169 --> 971.619
controlled because Owen Benjamin I can't

968.109 --> 974.349
find any element I feel like I am more

971.619 --> 978.969
controlled than he is okay and I am NOT

974.349 --> 980.4390000000001
controlled by anyone but myself so yeah

978.969 --> 982.989
that's what I meant

980.439 --> 984.129
that's not doublespeak if you think

982.989 --> 998.229
that's doublespeak then you're not

984.129 --> 1001.349
paying attention right yeah and so that

998.229 --> 1002.909
six six seven yeah I have watched it as

1001.349 --> 1004.7990000000001
well I haven't watched Eric Dubay

1002.909 --> 1007.499
rebuttals because I really can't stand

1004.799 --> 1011.909
the guy that much I like some of his

1007.499 --> 1014.369
videos but yeah I find the concept of

1011.909 --> 1017.22
stephania very fitting as with some

1014.369 --> 1021.659
other individuals that I directly called

1017.22 --> 1025.169
that to their face pretty much because

1021.659 --> 1027.179
yeah it's it's the form that's what

1025.169 --> 1029.689
makes it as a fan yay if you don't get

1027.179 --> 1032.3090000000002
that then you're not paying attention

1029.689 --> 1036.059
because Owen Benjamin is pointing at

1032.309 --> 1038.879
something that has not been defined yet

1036.059 --> 1047.129
it's there though it's pointing at

1038.879 --> 1049.9189999999999
something new yes that's that's correct

1047.129 --> 1052.799
the enemy can we are and if you if you

1049.919 --> 1057.2
don't then you get stuck and then you

1052.799 --> 1057.2
crumble it's as simple as that

1061.029 --> 1067.82
now I totally disagree and salt at 667

1065.289 --> 1071.33
so funny--i is not a misrepresentation

1067.82 --> 1073.8799999999999
and Eric does absolutely act like that

1071.33 --> 1080.149
and he has been for a very long time

1073.88 --> 1085.7600000000002
from the start and he embraces the

1080.149 --> 1087.86
behavior of his cult-like followers he

1085.76 --> 1089.929
could stop them from doing that he could

1087.86 --> 1091.6589999999999
tell them look this is bad this is not

1089.929 --> 1095.24
good stop doing that

1091.659 --> 1100.49
doesn't know I think he likes it I think

1095.24 --> 1104.69
he likes people using his name his ego

1100.49 --> 1107.69
to to try to crush others and that's

1104.69 --> 1111.799
just what it is I haven't seen anything

1107.69 --> 1117.71
that contradicts that I think that Eric

1111.799 --> 1122.96
Dubay he's not all terrible but he just

1117.71 --> 1129.14
has very blatant issues in the social

1122.96 --> 1132.94
sector and you can't ignore that because

1129.14 --> 1136.76
that that makes his followers that

1132.94 --> 1141.02
determines the atmosphere of his

1136.76 --> 1144.59
following you can't ignore that so no it

1141.02 --> 1148.1299999999999
is absolutely on target and it's not

1144.59 --> 1151.1
always that stereotypically bad but it

1148.13 --> 1154.0100000000002
is sometimes and that's something to

1151.1 --> 1157.1899999999998
keep in mind okay you gotta understand

1154.01 --> 1159.62
that when Benjamin does how he does it

1157.19 --> 1164.809
with his jokes like that near stole my

1159.62 --> 1166.899
bike or we never went through like the

1164.809 --> 1171.8899999999999
all the types they're over

1166.899 --> 1174.59
generalizations so you'll never find an

1171.89 --> 1177.169
individual exactly like that but you'll

1174.59 --> 1182.23
find individuals with elements like that

1177.169 --> 1182.23
and the same goes for a savonia because

1184.51 --> 1190.03
look it's not like Owen Benjamin sorry

1188.169 --> 1192.8200000000002
it's not like Eric Dubay is the only

1190.03 --> 1197.44
Sivan yay out there the world is freakin

1192.82 --> 1200.049
full of them it just happens to be this

1197.44 --> 1205.0
the individual that inspired him

1200.049 --> 1209.11
directly to create that caricature get

1205.0 --> 1211.66
it that's comedy it's it's building

1209.11 --> 1213.79
something it's never a perfect

1211.66 --> 1218.97
representation of reality and if you're

1213.79 --> 1218.97
caught up in that then just nitpicking

1229.13 --> 1232.409
[Music]

1234.42 --> 1240.45
oh I get you there hmm

1238.68 --> 1244.77
I don't always think Owen Benjamin is

1240.45 --> 1248.76
funny but that doesn't mean that he's

1244.77 --> 1250.8
never funny I think look any comedian

1248.76 --> 1253.98
will have ups and downs that's just how

1250.8 --> 1257.1
it works and he's improvising a lot he's

1253.98 --> 1260.49
trying new stuff out that's extremely

1257.1 --> 1264.1799999999998
difficult okay to do that you can't just

1260.49 --> 1266.04
the O's not good enough so one thing

1264.18 --> 1270.98
that's not funny and then it's all [ __ ]

1266.04 --> 1270.98
no that's ridiculous can can be serious

1275.03 --> 1287.04
but man look I've been very honest

1282.44 --> 1289.2
glorify Owen Benjamin to be represented

1287.04 --> 1293.21
better than he is but I do recognize

1289.2 --> 1297.06
that he is doing something valuable and

1293.21 --> 1300.69
I can feel it I can look I look at

1297.06 --> 1302.97
frequencies look at the path and I think

1300.69 --> 1305.25
that for the individual he is and the

1302.97 --> 1308.52
energies he deals with the Karma and all

1305.25 --> 1313.74
that he's doing great he's doing great

1308.52 --> 1315.45
kid so just if you can't accept that

1313.74 --> 1318.26
that's your problem

1315.45 --> 1318.26
really it is

1322.33 --> 1325.53
[Music]

1336.63 --> 1343.41
yeah but but that's that's where it

1340.47 --> 1347.46
becomes [ __ ] and Owen Benjamin even

1343.41 --> 1350.49
addressed this unsalted because people

1347.46 --> 1352.8600000000001
are not being turned away Eric Dubay is

1350.49 --> 1357.36
only gain subscribers that's the whole

1352.86 --> 1362.49
issue stupid it's wrong what you're

1357.36 --> 1364.6499999999999
saying is wrong it's not true so get

1362.49 --> 1369.39
over it it's just not true

1364.65 --> 1372.63
that's not how it works and it's not

1369.39 --> 1375.8400000000001
like Owen Benjamin is trying to kill him

1372.63 --> 1379.74
or you know like really attacking him

1375.84 --> 1382.6699999999998
like he's a insidious small hat or

1379.74 --> 1386.94
something you know he's not doing that

1382.67 --> 1388.77
he does make fun of his elements things

1386.94 --> 1395.64
that happen surrounding him so that's

1388.77 --> 1398.27
just it oh well if I haven't watched a

1395.64 --> 1401.93
record bottle because oh my god if Eric

1398.27 --> 1405.3
then yeah they'll explain everything and

1401.93 --> 1411.96
yeah I already feel that that's just

1405.3 --> 1414.21
[ __ ] really but you know for the

1411.96 --> 1417.21
heck of it I will watch Eric dubas

1414.21 --> 1419.16
rebuttal okay I think I already did it

1417.21 --> 1425.6100000000001
and I turn it off after like two minutes

1419.16 --> 1427.74
because it's just it's so whiny yeah I

1425.61 --> 1429.4799999999998
just said I probably already watched it

1427.74 --> 1433.04
and turn it off because I couldn't stand

1429.48 --> 1433.04
watching it so

1443.56 --> 1449.29
yeah I said I did say that and then I

1446.98 --> 1452.47
remembered that I probably did watch it

1449.29 --> 1456.07
at the time because sometimes when I say

1452.47 --> 1457.6000000000001
something well I might be incorrect and

1456.07 --> 1460.72
then as soon as I realized that I'll

1457.6 --> 1463.7199999999998
correct it just like I didn't know so

1460.72 --> 1465.4
I'm not sure but I think I saw it I'm

1463.72 --> 1468.19
pretty sure I haven't watched the whole

1465.4 --> 1475.21
thing that's what I'm pretty sure about

1468.19 --> 1476.44
so hey link it up whatever but I'm

1475.21 --> 1484.75
getting kind of sick of this

1476.44 --> 1487.98
conversation Eric Dubay fans then maybe

1484.75 --> 1492.07
you should just piss off really actually

1487.98 --> 1494.85
if you're going to get all that stepped

1492.07 --> 1498.51
on the toes about that that that really

1494.85 --> 1498.51
doesn't help

1504.67 --> 1507.3300000000002
weird

1508.51 --> 1511.67
[Music]

1519.52 --> 1522.809
sure it does

1531.639 --> 1538.1789999999999
lols okay anyway I'm gonna try calling

1535.909 --> 1538.179
the guys

1544.66 --> 1550.21
all right so well you know what let's

1548.02 --> 1552.6399999999999
just resolve this [ __ ] because I'm

1550.21 --> 1554.74
really sick of it now really like

1552.64 --> 1557.0800000000002
feeling like lashing out and blocking a

1554.74 --> 1558.79
whole bunch of people by now so let's

1557.08 --> 1562.24
just get it out of the way okay you're

1558.79 --> 1565.09
saying he exposed Owen Benjamin wizard

1562.24 --> 1567.97
so put it down in Chet you got two

1565.09 --> 1570.78
hundred characters to do it put it there

1567.97 --> 1573.76
I want to see a concrete example

1570.78 --> 1576.25
translated in text of what Owen Benjamin

1573.76 --> 1579.67
did that is wizardry and I want it now

1576.25 --> 1580.35
and if I'm hearing anything else other

1579.67 --> 1584.0800000000002
than that

1580.35 --> 1585.87
concerning Eric Dubay then I'm just

1584.08 --> 1591.49
going to time you out maybe block you

1585.87 --> 1598.6
okay so please put it there or stop

1591.49 --> 1599.08
talking about it and I'm gonna enjoy

1598.6 --> 1602.07
this

1599.08 --> 1602.07
call sign

1605.21 --> 1609.14
[Music]

1612.8 --> 1616.0
[Music]

1624.71 --> 1632.47
a really Jason Carmack

1635.47 --> 1644.95
that's wizardry no that's a trick that's

1639.7 --> 1649.47
not wizardry wizardry is about

1644.95 --> 1653.98
programming is about mind-control about

1649.47 --> 1657.1290000000001
pushing people's lesser conscience into

1653.98 --> 1661.169
a specific direction that's wizardry so

1657.129 --> 1661.1689999999999
please give me the example

1681.23 --> 1687.25
hmm

1683.91 --> 1690.69
okay yes I've heard something about that

1687.25 --> 1693.25
thank you that's not wizardry by the way

1690.69 --> 1695.5900000000001
but I heard something like that and I

1693.25 --> 1697.87
expected it you know Owen actually

1695.59 --> 1699.6999999999998
explained that and what we have whatever

1697.87 --> 1705.309
you think about that he did that and he

1699.7 --> 1707.71
did do that I totally agree okay but I

1705.309 --> 1711.49
also explained that he just didn't feel

1707.71 --> 1714.07
right because of all the fans that were

1711.49 --> 1716.71
literally barging him and trying to

1714.07 --> 1720.6399999999999
manipulate him even before this was

1716.71 --> 1723.33
gonna happen and he just chose to go

1720.64 --> 1723.3300000000002
another direction

1738.17 --> 1740.8600000000001
yep

1748.46 --> 1756.7
right yeah eat it that absolutely I know

1753.83 --> 1760.84
I'm not gonna have illusions about that

1756.7 --> 1764.059
but still that's not wizardry

1760.84 --> 1765.6789999999999
that's simply being kind of an

1764.059 --> 1767.9289999999999
unpredictable character and I can

1765.679 --> 1771.1100000000001
probably explain not that it really

1767.929 --> 1774.049
matters it's just my explanation I could

1771.11 --> 1778.4799999999998
probably explain why he had that just a

1774.049 --> 1784.129
personal allergy I for two sometimes

1778.48 --> 1787.1
like even if you watch people do

1784.129 --> 1789.889
interacting with others it's very very

1787.1 --> 1791.84
different when you start to live

1789.889 --> 1795.309
interact with them it's a whole new

1791.84 --> 1800.029
feeling maybe he felt it and was just

1795.309 --> 1802.309
disgusted even though there was no real

1800.029 --> 1806.149
interaction to back up the feeling yet

1802.309 --> 1808.19
and then he just said okay screw it I'm

1806.149 --> 1809.9289999999999
not gonna deal with this guy because I'm

1808.19 --> 1814.1000000000001
already sick of him and he hasn't even

1809.929 --> 1816.259
said anything yet yeah that seems pretty

1814.1 --> 1820.869
much like what Owen Benjamin would do

1816.259 --> 1820.869
absolutely very rushed

1833.04 --> 1840.69
oh really so what did he say and salt it

1836.96 --> 1844.46
if Owen lied about Eric so what did he

1840.69 --> 1844.46
lie about can you be more specific

1854.0 --> 1859.67
no you didn't you just said this is what

1857.87 --> 1860.6599999999999
happened this is what happened and I

1859.67 --> 1862.76
said yeah sure

1860.66 --> 1869.14
I totally buy that so what did Owen

1862.76 --> 1869.14
Benjamin say about that that was a lie I

1869.98 --> 1875.1200000000001
don't give a [ __ ] about his rebuttal I

1872.54 --> 1877.69
want to hear what Owen Benjamin said

1875.12 --> 1881.08
that was a lie

1877.69 --> 1881.0800000000002
last chance

1929.58 --> 1942.869
he said that Eric was all screaming in

1933.149 --> 1946.9399999999998
jet hmm so this wasn't about the actual

1942.869 --> 1946.9399999999998
meeting was it

1955.77 --> 1962.09
it was about something that he saw about

1959.7 --> 1966.98
Eric's behavior somewhere else wasn't it

1962.09 --> 1966.98
it's not about the actual meeting was it

1967.52 --> 1975.1399999999999
hmm never acted that way because Eric

1970.86 --> 1982.4599999999998
Dubay is never misbehaved in chat I

1975.14 --> 1982.46
think it's time for you to go goodbye

1984.41 --> 1991.4
I'm sick of the slandering [ __ ] if

1988.02 --> 1995.04
you're gonna put an accusation lied

1991.4 --> 1998.7900000000002
Wizardry you better damn well put the

1995.04 --> 2001.97
exact thing that that entails with the

1998.79 --> 2005.33
accusation okay because I'm sick of

2001.97 --> 2012.8600000000001
these loose accusations I'm sick of it

2005.33 --> 2015.32
you're not gonna do that here okay leave

2012.86 --> 2020.7199999999998
that for Jose's check and for the

2015.32 --> 2022.04
debates spew your filth over there okay

2020.72 --> 2025.8500000000001
I'm sick of it

2022.04 --> 2029.47
I can't believe I allow this to continue

2025.85 --> 2029.4699999999998
on for over 15 minutes

2034.66 --> 2066.25
you know yeah that's not so that's not

2040.07 --> 2072.52
do that yep through over-mighty

2066.25 --> 2072.52
brilliant okay are you right back

2111.09 --> 2116.27
[Music]

2113.03 --> 2119.42
yeah you know you know why I'm also kind

2116.27 --> 2121.55
of pissed about people actually trying

2119.42 --> 2124.7000000000003
to burn Owen Benjamin in the face of

2121.55 --> 2127.7000000000003
Eric Dubay because Eric Dubay is a

2124.7 --> 2133.37
disgusting person he's behaved to me

2127.7 --> 2135.56
like a disgusting person vile not to the

2133.37 --> 2138.5299999999997
level as right to hand let himself do

2135.56 --> 2142.4
but he was pretty damn disgusting and he

2138.53 --> 2149.09
called me like a Jew lover boy and that

2142.4 --> 2151.79
kind of just sylvania er just this chill

2149.09 --> 2154.78
in this category that is what freaking

2151.79 --> 2157.97
Eric Dubay did okay Eric Dubay almost

2154.78 --> 2161.3900000000003
single-handedly introduced a freakin

2157.97 --> 2166.85
shill meme okay to the flatter that's

2161.39 --> 2173.06
him [ __ ] Eric Dubay okay see the

2166.85 --> 2176.21
issue here yeah how long ago did that

2173.06 --> 2178.5499999999997
happen well probably around three years

2176.21 --> 2180.17
ago when I was just starting out and

2178.55 --> 2187.4
getting involved in chats and made

2180.17 --> 2190.94
comments yeah he did that did that in

2187.4 --> 2194.48
Skype yes and he did that in comments

2190.94 --> 2197.3
but he's very careful he's a sneaky sick

2194.48 --> 2200.75
bastard because he knows he's like

2197.3 --> 2202.94
always trying to cover his tracks tries

2200.75 --> 2206.27
to bring in messages and make sure it's

2202.94 --> 2210.68
not recorded some he's a sneaky bastard

2206.27 --> 2213.71
he's a savant a sicko I don't like him

2210.68 --> 2216.29
I don't like anything about him and he

2213.71 --> 2219.55
talks like a [ __ ]

2216.29 --> 2219.55
[Music]

2223.2 --> 2238.279
[Music]

2230.14 --> 2242.259
so good to get that out so yeah I'm

2238.279 --> 2242.259
totally with Owen Benjamin on this one

2244.449 --> 2250.819
that's right kitty cat and he does it

2247.039 --> 2251.809
all the time and he's been doing it from

2250.819 --> 2255.4
the start

2251.809 --> 2259.599
guess we started out with mark sergeant

2255.4 --> 2263.7490000000003
Patricia steer and of course Nathan and

2259.599 --> 2267.8590000000004
Reilly and everyone everyone but Eric

2263.749 --> 2271.3689999999997
Dubay is a shill okay everyone except

2267.859 --> 2283.939
the people that really grovel to him

2271.369 --> 2293.029
really badly so no no I will I will not

2283.939 --> 2296.1789999999996
rest that although I just yeah I don't

2293.029 --> 2298.959
what is weird about seeing saying pide

2296.179 --> 2298.9590000000003
Pinus

2312.9 --> 2318.059
no Ben Adams Eric Dubay was not the one

2316.2 --> 2321.39
that started it all and neither was mark

2318.059 --> 2324.2690000000002
Sargent Flat Earth has been going on for

2321.39 --> 2329.3289999999997
a long time Eric Dubay was just the

2324.269 --> 2335.22
first to claim his mark with his ego and

2329.329 --> 2337.4700000000003
mark Sargent really started up d the

2335.22 --> 2340.2889999999998
enthusiastic social media spreading

2337.47 --> 2342.99
thing about it he really tried to spread

2340.289 --> 2347.9700000000003
it out in a very open format to try and

2342.99 --> 2350.8489999999997
touch the the more general public with

2347.97 --> 2354.0589999999997
it and that's just something he did he

2350.849 --> 2356.4900000000002
didn't introduce Flat Earth ok Flat

2354.059 --> 2361.349
Earth has been going on forever that's

2356.49 --> 2363.1189999999997
been like studio recordings from the 60s

2361.349 --> 2365.2490000000003
talking about Flat Earth related

2363.119 --> 2369.1400000000003
subjects that are still videos around ok

2365.249 --> 2372.72
Flat Earth is been out there forever

2369.14 --> 2375.96
so mark Sargent nor Eric Dubay started

2372.72 --> 2379.68
Flat Earth but they did create a pretty

2375.96 --> 2383.94
big wave especially mark sardine I think

2379.68 --> 2387.0589999999997
really did but Eric Dubay yeah in his

2383.94 --> 2391.2490000000003
own way also but yeah he definitely

2387.059 --> 2393.9
bread the whole stephania thing into it

2391.249 --> 2394.6189999999997
aggravated ego behavior among

2393.9 --> 2397.079
flat-earthers

2394.619 --> 2399.71
the great deal with his presence I'm

2397.079 --> 2399.71
sure of it

2402.65 --> 2409.4
yeah I kind of agree with that skeptic

2405.41 --> 2416.109
9:31 but I've been saying that for a

2409.4 --> 2420.289
long time it's just no use

2416.109 --> 2423.499
people are just gonna block me with with

2420.289 --> 2425.6600000000003
yeah she oh oh you are against Eric

2423.499 --> 2427.99
Dubay then you must be shield just like

2425.66 --> 2435.6499999999996
he always says about everyone

2427.99 --> 2440.2589999999996
it's the sivanna doctrine it's the

2435.65 --> 2442.849
unspoken Savannah doctrine people do it

2440.259 --> 2446.14
it's routed in the sort of Stockholm

2442.849 --> 2446.1400000000003
Syndrome behavior

2457.61 --> 2464.58
all right mark Collard well a Sivan yay

2461.18 --> 2467.1299999999997
I got it from Owen Benjamin but he got

2464.58 --> 2471.59
it from somebody else I don't even think

2467.13 --> 2474.51
it was flattering related just a type of

2471.59 --> 2476.58
attention whiny person on the internet

2474.51 --> 2479.3700000000003
trying to make a cult for themselves and

2476.58 --> 2481.35
somebody figure that out made a very

2479.37 --> 2483.7799999999997
funny video about it then Owen Benjamin

2481.35 --> 2487.2
showed it got all sarvagna hyped about

2483.78 --> 2489.3
it and then eventually pointed at Eric

2487.2 --> 2493.98
Dubay and his followers roughly that's

2489.3 --> 2496.11
how that started but originally it's

2493.98 --> 2499.41
just a meme from some random guy on the

2496.11 --> 2501.8700000000003
internet yeah that's how the best memes

2499.41 --> 2505.95
always start from some random guy on the

2501.87 --> 2509.33
Internet mmm thanks why do we arrest

2505.95 --> 2513.5099999999998
ahead I do my best

2509.33 --> 2518.34
had some things to get off my chest also

2513.51 --> 2521.1000000000004
I've been finally after months now I've

2518.34 --> 2523.92
finally been able to contact my healer

2521.1 --> 2526.2599999999998
again who's been on vacation and had

2523.92 --> 2528.89
this telephone just turned off you

2526.26 --> 2532.1400000000003
needed a break like I'm not the only guy

2528.89 --> 2535.23
actually requiring his attention so yeah

2532.14 --> 2536.58
I can imagine he'd need a long break but

2535.23 --> 2539.67
it was really good seeing him in again

2536.58 --> 2544.62
and he cleaned me out in a good way not

2539.67 --> 2547.2000000000003
financially and I feel a lot stronger

2544.62 --> 2548.97
and that sickness that I mentioned

2547.2 --> 2553.85
yesterday that I sometimes have that

2548.97 --> 2557.37
weird almost morning sickness thing well

2553.85 --> 2561.45
we figured it out and it had to do with

2557.37 --> 2564.1099999999997
earthing issues that was expressing well

2561.45 --> 2568.3199999999997
let's just say in spiritual approach

2564.11 --> 2571.17
comes down to my spirit has a lot of

2568.32 --> 2578.34
trouble remaining in my body because of

2571.17 --> 2581.25
my curiosity and personal issues I have

2578.34 --> 2583.4100000000003
with the world so then my spirit tries

2581.25 --> 2587.98
to yeah even though my consciousness is

2583.41 --> 2590.92
here my spirit just tries to go away

2587.98 --> 2593.59
and that then causes attention in my

2590.92 --> 2595.4500000000003
stomach where at the same time my spirit

2593.59 --> 2597.31
or my conscience is trying to force my

2595.45 --> 2598.8399999999997
spirit back into my body this sounds

2597.31 --> 2600.82
really weird probably for the most of

2598.84 --> 2604.6000000000004
you it kind of does to me too but it

2600.82 --> 2606.8700000000003
works it's like a technical language in

2604.6 --> 2609.97
a way and it really works what he does

2606.87 --> 2611.02
so I'm just going with it then it does

2609.97 --> 2613.12
kind of make sense

2611.02 --> 2617.8
but it is it takes some getting used to

2613.12 --> 2620.4
it is really a little very vague if

2617.8 --> 2625.6000000000004
you're not used to it so I get that but

2620.4 --> 2628.09
he helped me basically undo that and the

2625.6 --> 2629.83
sickness went away it's like such a

2628.09 --> 2634.86
relief because it's been sitting there

2629.83 --> 2638.38
for over a month every morning so yeah

2634.86 --> 2640.6
it's just I feel a lot better a lot

2638.38 --> 2642.67
stronger and I have more conviction so

2640.6 --> 2645.31
that's probably what you guys just saw

2642.67 --> 2650.35
for me I have a lot more conviction and

2645.31 --> 2653.47
I also had a great compliments from from

2650.35 --> 2656.89
my healer that despite of all the

2653.47 --> 2660.73
typical issue that I seemed very strong

2656.89 --> 2663.31
and more more attuned to the Spirit of

2660.73 --> 2668.71
Christ he said and I'm yeah so I had it

2663.31 --> 2671.44
I feel great I feel strong and I'm I'm

2668.71 --> 2673.8
relieved because I do now realize that

2671.44 --> 2676.75
yeah I am doing okay

2673.8 --> 2679.51
feeling [ __ ] really makes you draw

2676.75 --> 2681.7
everything you do into doubt that's like

2679.51 --> 2683.59
a problem if you just don't feel well it

2681.7 --> 2686.02
makes you draw everything you do into

2683.59 --> 2690.73
doubt just naturally now that that's

2686.02 --> 2692.7
gone I see clearly now like wait no no

2690.73 --> 2695.26
it was fine it was actually pretty good

2692.7 --> 2697.96
can't really find moments where it's

2695.26 --> 2703.3
like oh terrible I shouldn't done that

2697.96 --> 2706.3
no no went fine I've compared to say the

2703.3 --> 2709.8700000000003
first hundred episodes of the early bird

2706.3 --> 2713.26
show I was pretty crazy at times and

2709.87 --> 2715.24
went over-the-top overboard like certain

2713.26 --> 2718.0
bursts of negative energy came out

2715.24 --> 2718.5899999999997
really badly and that hasn't really

2718.0 --> 2723.03
happened

2718.59 --> 2726.57
now for the last few hundred I think

2723.03 --> 2732.9300000000003
when you guys agree my energy management

2726.57 --> 2736.86
seems better anyway I'm gonna try to

2732.93 --> 2739.83
call the guys again not by the way I

2736.86 --> 2741.09
probably shouldn't do that because the

2739.83 --> 2746.1
debates are about to start in ten

2741.09 --> 2753.7200000000003
minutes that's cozy no way no way Jose

2746.1 --> 2755.91
oh by the way another thing yeah a bit

2753.72 --> 2760.83
of an announcement not for myself but

2755.91 --> 2763.3199999999997
I've heard through a special chat that

2760.83 --> 2766.86
the Amsterdam conference may be in

2763.32 --> 2768.8700000000003
trouble because it is said that there's

2766.86 --> 2771.57
yeah it seems like there's not enough

2768.87 --> 2774.5099999999998
people actually going there and it might

2771.57 --> 2777.1800000000003
risk being cancelled so I want to tell

2774.51 --> 2778.8300000000004
everyone out there please if you have

2777.18 --> 2779.27
considered going there and buying a

2778.83 --> 2783.2999999999997
ticket

2779.27 --> 2785.84
don't wait buy it quickly because

2783.3 --> 2789.15
otherwise it might just be cancelled and

2785.84 --> 2791.94
this is the one that I'm gonna go to so

2789.15 --> 2793.86
if you want to meet Arwen better buy the

2791.94 --> 2797.34
ticket go to the conference on Saturday

2793.86 --> 2800.85
I'm going on Saturday so please make

2797.34 --> 2802.17
sure that it's not gonna it's yeah it's

2800.85 --> 2804.24
not gonna be canceled I would be

2802.17 --> 2806.7000000000003
seriously disappointed because I really

2804.24 --> 2808.08
do want to meet flat other flat earthers

2806.7 --> 2812.9399999999996
and especially people I have known from

2808.08 --> 2814.56
YouTube in person and just I'm looking

2812.94 --> 2821.6
forward to that so I don't want it

2814.56 --> 2821.6
canceled yeah

2824.119 --> 2828.17
just couldn't help yourself could you

2832.339 --> 2840.45
am I going to present there I I haven't

2835.829 --> 2841.579
been asked asked to do that I've offered

2840.45 --> 2845.3689999999997
it

2841.579 --> 2850.38
I've told Gary like I am

2845.369 --> 2852.509
I represent my my cosmogenic concepts

2850.38 --> 2854.549
the general picture of the unknown and

2852.509 --> 2858.299
what it could be an angle like that or

2854.549 --> 2861.739
present a specific rectangular looping

2858.299 --> 2866.579
model absolutely do that

2861.739 --> 2869.5190000000002
so whatever I'm ready basically to

2866.579 --> 2870.1800000000003
improvise whatever is needed of me I can

2869.519 --> 2873.9199999999996
do it all

2870.18 --> 2873.9199999999996
I'm very confident about that

2874.68 --> 2877.85
[Music]

2887.94 --> 2899.01
and it's right at a rectangular looping

2894.18 --> 2902.3689999999997
model is absolutely a relevant model it

2899.01 --> 2904.7400000000002
is actually a model that has probably

2902.369 --> 2907.71
more viability than any other flat earth

2904.74 --> 2912.299
model especially considering the knowns

2907.71 --> 2915.45
the known data and the honesty about the

2912.299 --> 2919.02
known data for example the firmament

2915.45 --> 2923.5389999999998
there is no clue whatsoever that the

2919.02 --> 2926.339
firmament is how is a dome there is no

2923.539 --> 2930.15
verbal reference in the Bible whatsoever

2926.339 --> 2933.72
it's only there to split the waters from

2930.15 --> 2936.599
the water to sit there to do all these

2933.72 --> 2939.589
things there is no indication or even a

2936.599 --> 2943.829
clue that it actually touches the earth

2939.589 --> 2946.049
in any location when you take that into

2943.829 --> 2950.869
account suddenly a concept of a pretty

2946.049 --> 2955.02
surreal rectangular looping earth with

2950.869 --> 2957.029
similar Tory elements and non actual

2955.02 --> 2961.65
location heavenly bodies suddenly

2957.029 --> 2968.549
becomes a lot more reasonable and that's

2961.65 --> 2971.2200000000003
why I buy over time I keep keeping them

2968.549 --> 2973.95
it's not that promote really it's still

2971.22 --> 2977.22
a very good option and there's all these

2973.95 --> 2979.109
interesting clues to find out that

2977.22 --> 2985.47
normally the ballers would use as a win

2979.109 --> 2988.109
okay so for example oh let's just see if

2985.47 --> 2991.77
the Equator is indeed a circle as the

2988.109 --> 2994.859
flat earthers discours say so let's go

2991.77 --> 2998.25
over the equator line according to the

2994.859 --> 3001.94
celestial layout and follow it and see

2998.25 --> 3004.52
if you deviate in any direction and if

3001.94 --> 3006.349
it doesn't happen well then it must be a

3004.52 --> 3009.65
globe because we're going in a straight

3006.349 --> 3013.4500000000003
line around the circle over there over

3009.65 --> 3017.75
the horizon curve bla bla that well no

3013.45 --> 3020.8089999999997
but hey in a rectangular looping model

3017.75 --> 3021.83
if you're if the equator is a perfectly

3020.809 --> 3025.01
straight line and

3021.83 --> 3025.43
end up in the same place yeah that could

3025.01 --> 3027.6800000000003
work

3025.43 --> 3029.72
absolutely it's actually a necessity for

3027.68 --> 3039.02
the rectangular looping earth to be able

3029.72 --> 3043.2099999999996
to be what it is and I've been making

3039.02 --> 3046.36
that argument for three years

3043.21 --> 3049.07
never got a lot of support for it but

3046.36 --> 3051.56
did get some recognition from Flat Earth

3049.07 --> 3054.1400000000003
us really appreciated that they leave at

3051.56 --> 3060.23
least gave some recognition but that is

3054.14 --> 3067.3399999999997
a big thing is the equator a straight

3060.23 --> 3069.7
line or is it a circle geometrically so

3067.34 --> 3072.6800000000003
that that's something that can be tested

3069.7 --> 3079.97
and should be tested it's not easy

3072.68 --> 3084.7999999999997
though unless you have a jet plane under

3079.97 --> 3087.35
your full control and permission and all

3084.8 --> 3089.77
that yeah it's not gonna happen anytime

3087.35 --> 3089.77
easy

3093.69 --> 3101.46
yeah saucy London I think that's that

3096.119 --> 3107.759
should sound about correct it's not for

3101.46 --> 3112.039
bums it is quite a and yeah it's quite

3107.759 --> 3114.75
an event and it's Amsterdam so it's

3112.039 --> 3117.7690000000002
Amsterdam is pretty expensive overall

3114.75 --> 3117.769
it's not in the middle of nowhere

3141.329 --> 3149.23
yeah

3143.83 --> 3151.6
oh you did oh cool oh thank you I killed

3149.23 --> 3157.0
a hope I hope I hope to see you there

3151.6 --> 3159.52
that will be awesome who's who's there

3157.0 --> 3162.79
else who else is there I think that mark

3159.52 --> 3169.63
Sargent would be coming there people

3162.79 --> 3172.15
like again allegedly Dave I think a

3169.63 --> 3174.37
typical crowd it's not really fast

3172.15 --> 3175.96
I think Patricia would would have come

3174.37 --> 3177.46
originally as well but yeah you know

3175.96 --> 3180.31
what happened with that that's kind of a

3177.46 --> 3183.0
disappointment I'd have to look over the

3180.31 --> 3183.0
schedule Oh

3184.9 --> 3191.94
oh thank you : Turner for the 10-pound

3187.93 --> 3191.94
Supachai donation much appreciated ah

3194.16 --> 3201.43
yeah sure hey we're gonna be in

3197.32 --> 3203.29
Amsterdam oh I I'm also going to meet up

3201.43 --> 3205.5699999999997
with Dan Winfield a guy that kind of

3203.29 --> 3206.58
known for a time through the flat earth

3205.57 --> 3212.05
scene

3206.58 --> 3215.2599999999998
and we were planning to afterward go out

3212.05 --> 3217.03
for the night and yeah I have a couple

3215.26 --> 3221.26
of joints here in there whatever see

3217.03 --> 3222.82
what what we're gonna do and after that

3221.26 --> 3235.09
I'm just gonna take the train back home

3222.82 --> 3238.51
to Utrecht play some D in the the thing

3235.09 --> 3242.23
about playing B in D is it takes a lot

3238.51 --> 3244.3
of work to do for even for the player so

3242.23 --> 3248.04
it's not a game you just like oh let's

3244.3 --> 3251.7400000000002
turn it on let's get going no way

3248.04 --> 3256.21
usually takes several hours before you

3251.74 --> 3258.52
can even begin to start playing just

3256.21 --> 3262.68
making characters and working out all

3258.52 --> 3268.83
the details and D&D is quite a big hobby

3262.68 --> 3268.83
so I'm not gonna be playing D&D
