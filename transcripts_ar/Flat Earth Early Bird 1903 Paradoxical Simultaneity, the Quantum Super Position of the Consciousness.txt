great all

101.68 --> 106.64
right weather today

104.92 --> 111.88
is

106.64 --> 116.2
restless a lot of wind out there kind of

111.88 --> 120.719
Stormy some sun just came out right

116.2 --> 122.759
now so there's still some sun happening

120.719 --> 123.6
but yeah there's also just these really

122.759 --> 126.92
big

123.6 --> 126.91999999999999
clouds going

131.36 --> 138.20000000000002
about and probably lots of rain coming

135.56 --> 141.519
out of them when they come

138.2 --> 144.04
over look at that isn't that just an

141.519 --> 144.04
amazing

148.84 --> 151.84
sight

164.879 --> 170.39999999999998
yeah all right

167.36 --> 176.76000000000002
so hello Richard first in chat good to

170.4 --> 176.76000000000002
see you it is Sunday the 24th of March

177.599 --> 181.83999999999997
2024 uh

185.56 --> 190.48
temperatures 7Â° C

192.239 --> 202.159
okay 32 km an hour wind yeah that makes

198.08 --> 202.15900000000002
sense 87%

204.44 --> 207.44
humidity

208.76 --> 211.76
right

215.599 --> 220.2
so yeah have I got a title for you guys

220.45 --> 223.6
[Music]

226.599 --> 232.2
today was watching Owen Benjamin's

229.799 --> 233.959
yesterday on his bonus stream which

232.2 --> 238.72
lasted nice and

233.959 --> 241.72
long and yeah got got inspired got this

238.72 --> 241.72
idea

244.64 --> 249.83999999999997
and it's an interesting idea and it's

246.92 --> 253.55999999999997
not even the first time that I've

249.84 --> 253.56
tackled this idea except

253.799 --> 260.68
now I saw what seem to be a

257.88 --> 262.959
solution although since we're dealing

260.68 --> 262.959
with

264.72 --> 268.56
paradoxes one would

268.72 --> 275.44000000000005
say that is could easily be an

272.08 --> 278.479
aberration a pretty heavy one even

275.44 --> 281.0
but it's still still thought it was

278.479 --> 284.8
worth

281.0 --> 284.8
sharing paradoxical

284.919 --> 288.88
simultaneity Quantum superposition of

287.479 --> 290.919
the

288.88 --> 293.8
Consciousness right and this

290.919 --> 293.79999999999995
specifically

294.479 --> 297.479
concerns

298.479 --> 305.24
the I'm I'm sure there is a name for

301.52 --> 309.56
it but I don't know the exact name but

305.24 --> 312.56
it is basically the the two philosophies

309.56 --> 315.44
of God of

312.56 --> 319.52
creation that are

315.44 --> 321.24
well in direct opposition to one another

319.52 --> 323.52
I think

321.24 --> 327.56
it's

323.52 --> 327.56
determinism versus free

328.639 --> 333.68
will

330.639 --> 335.52
and yeah this is something that people

333.68 --> 340.6
that have

335.52 --> 344.15999999999997
like religious beliefs and uh like to

340.6 --> 346.08000000000004
argue philosophy behind all of like

344.16 --> 348.28000000000003
Christianity and other

346.08 --> 353.15999999999997
religions it's something they typically

348.28 --> 357.44
like to debate and have for arguably as

353.16 --> 360.24
long as religion even existed

357.44 --> 361.71999999999997
right the idea of free will that Free

360.24 --> 364.36
Will

361.72 --> 368.36
determines

364.36 --> 370.28000000000003
everything and that our choices are like

368.36 --> 372.72
not

370.28 --> 375.96
predestined in a

372.72 --> 378.03900000000004
way and the other the other one is

375.96 --> 381.28
determinism I think I got the right word

378.039 --> 383.68
for that and that is that everything is

381.28 --> 385.88
basically set including the choices that

383.68 --> 385.88
you

387.599 --> 391.56
make by God

394.36 --> 401.759
and I've always had

397.88 --> 403.759
this feeling about it like no they're

401.759 --> 406.08000000000004
they're both

403.759 --> 409.039
true

406.08 --> 411.96
except you can't really logically

409.039 --> 415.08
justify it because well they're in

411.96 --> 418.0
direct opposition to one

415.08 --> 420.19899999999996
another but then I thought like but what

418.0 --> 424.16
if the

420.199 --> 424.16
direct incompatibility the

424.56 --> 429.599
paradoxical opposition to one another is

427.759 --> 435.08000000000004
actually

429.599 --> 435.08
part of a Quantum superposition of the

436.319 --> 443.52000000000004
Consciousness where we as individuals

439.919 --> 445.52
and our Consciousness basically

443.52 --> 448.52
are in

445.52 --> 451.52
both and we get

448.52 --> 451.52
to

451.8 --> 455.24
yeah get the

456.68 --> 464.479
choose it's yeah another way to

461.319 --> 467.28000000000003
basically roll it over quickly is to say

464.479 --> 470.8
like yeah our free

467.28 --> 474.28
choices even though they are free have

470.8 --> 477.28000000000003
all been accounted for because of a a

474.28 --> 481.08
wider lce a wider

477.28 --> 482.039
framework that simply contains all of

481.08 --> 486.0
our

482.039 --> 491.599
workings and thus even with our free

486.0 --> 491.599
choices we can't completely escape the

492.36 --> 495.84000000000003
determinism anyway hello Clary good to

494.8 --> 498.8
see

495.84 --> 500.23999999999995
you oh yeah religion is yeah yeah yeah

498.8 --> 503.36
yeah that it has nothing to do with

500.24 --> 506.96000000000004
anything that I'm talking

503.36 --> 506.96000000000004
about I'm talking

507.36 --> 512.639
about the Fate of existence

520.76 --> 527.2
itself right so I

522.959 --> 530.92
thought would be an interesting thing to

527.2 --> 530.9200000000001
share that there might

533.0 --> 540.72
be a paradoxical

536.88 --> 545.56
simultaneity and I like the word too or

540.72 --> 545.5600000000001
the combination of word it's very

549.47 --> 552.549
[Music]

557.52 --> 563.48
[Music]

568.36 --> 571.36
ornan

572.32 --> 578.25
right but I think

575.15 --> 578.25
[Music]

578.36 --> 585.04
that when you basically surrender to the

581.44 --> 586.6800000000001
idea that you have no free will in the

585.04 --> 589.56
face of

586.68 --> 592.3599999999999
creation then you basically surrender to

589.56 --> 592.3599999999999
a form of

595.56 --> 600.64
determinism but that if you as an

598.2 --> 602.72
individual can

600.64 --> 607.4399999999999
like feel your

602.72 --> 611.0790000000001
way into yeah the selfdetermination

607.44 --> 612.839
form within the relatively small context

611.079 --> 615.8389999999999
of your own

612.839 --> 615.839
life

616.279 --> 620.519
then free will really

623.72 --> 631.32
matters it's just that will your free

627.04 --> 631.3199999999999
will also

631.399 --> 636.68
free others people's

633.68 --> 641.079
will you see and I think there's like

636.68 --> 645.16
this yin yang effect within it it's very

641.079 --> 648.079
much like the the

645.16 --> 651.24
oppositional system of the light and the

648.079 --> 654.279
Darkness like the brighter a

651.24 --> 655.76
light the bigger the darkness that

654.279 --> 661.24
contrasts

655.76 --> 661.24
it so if Free Will is

662.48 --> 667.279
manifested then

664.519 --> 671.519
determinism might be reinforced

667.279 --> 674.48
surrounding it basically ensuring that

671.519 --> 678.44
even with a free will you won't just

674.48 --> 681.12
change the entire world around like it's

678.44 --> 683.9200000000001
interesting how it works

681.12 --> 689.8
that true Free

683.92 --> 693.1999999999999
Will tends to not really be infectious

689.8 --> 698.56
because Free Will comes with the like a

693.2 --> 704.36
price an opposition that contains its

698.56 --> 704.3599999999999
influence and that containment is like

704.88 --> 709.2
determinism so there's a form for a

707.6 --> 712.279
paradoxical

709.2 --> 717.48
simultaneity of determinism versus Free

712.279 --> 721.399
Will and how that works how that can

717.48 --> 723.9590000000001
work something to think about loud L did

721.399 --> 723.959
Gary do

730.48 --> 736.1990000000001
music CL tiger bear Clockwork Orange

739.6 --> 742.88
what that's

743.199 --> 747.959
interesting Clockwork Orange is kind of

746.16 --> 750.399
like that isn't

747.959 --> 753.4399999999999
it it does

750.399 --> 755.639
study those principles doesn't it within

753.44 --> 755.639
the

759.6 --> 763.839
movie title had something to do with

762.199 --> 766.8389999999999
that oh really it

763.839 --> 766.839
did

772.76 --> 778.12
okay hey Luna loves you Haven seen you

775.92 --> 781.12
in a while good to see

778.12 --> 781.12
you

783.92 --> 790.079
and IL G good to see

787.079 --> 790.079
you

794.44 --> 800.8000000000001
right so yeah inspiration going all

797.199 --> 800.8
around especially in the

804.72 --> 811.12
evenings some interesting fled Earth

807.44 --> 811.12
Community News apparently

811.639 --> 818.12
L could barely believe bumping into it

814.44 --> 821.1990000000001
apparently Wit It Wit It gets it got

818.12 --> 821.199
invited by Joe

824.399 --> 828.16
Rogan

826.6 --> 830.12
yeah

828.16 --> 832.8389999999999
so that's

830.12 --> 836.279
new and kind of

832.839 --> 836.2790000000001
interesting hello

838.04 --> 841.04
Sam

842.36 --> 848.519
yeah didn't expect that and I

845.56 --> 851.8
mean he's a good guy like he

848.519 --> 853.48
is a very good talker so I'm I'm like

851.8 --> 856.24
kind of curious as to what's going to

853.48 --> 859.32
happen is Joe Rogan going to be nice or

856.24 --> 862.839
is he going to ENT trap

859.32 --> 864.6
him is it going to like I yeah it could

862.839 --> 866.0790000000001
go in all kinds of directions so I

864.6 --> 867.12
really wonder what that's going to be

866.079 --> 870.199
like if he's

867.12 --> 872.839
gonna like try to

870.199 --> 876.079
push him into the mud for being a flat

872.839 --> 877.2790000000001
earther or if he's going to yeah I where

876.079 --> 880.7199999999999
it's going to

877.279 --> 884.639
go maybe it's going to be more General

880.72 --> 884.639
talk very curious to

886.68 --> 892.199
[Music]

888.6 --> 893.5600000000001
see certainly know there's a certain

892.199 --> 896.199
group of people that are going to be

893.56 --> 896.199
jealous about

897.68 --> 905.399
it but it is an interesting maneuver to

902.199 --> 905.399
invite more flat

911.92 --> 917.519
earthers by Joe Rogan so yeah we'll see

914.8 --> 921.0
where that goes interesting

917.519 --> 924.44
development happening

921.0 --> 924.44
soon was it

927.959 --> 933.199
again

930.759 --> 933.1990000000001
April

939.959 --> 944.16
8th right that I don't know they might

942.24 --> 947.92
have already been they might have

944.16 --> 951.959
already recorded it it's not like Rogan

947.92 --> 955.68
does things live because it's way too

951.959 --> 957.92
scary can't do it live then people could

955.68 --> 960.92
just say no no

957.92 --> 960.92
things

960.959 --> 966.56
all right anyway that's

963.12 --> 970.279
happening it's kind of interesting

966.56 --> 973.68
development and also I've been starting

970.279 --> 976.88
a new Netflix series which is pretty

973.68 --> 979.319
heavy it's called the three body

976.88 --> 983.72
problem and it

979.319 --> 985.76
is very intense but also

983.72 --> 987.9200000000001
unintendedly hilarious to

985.76 --> 989.4399999999999
[Music]

987.92 --> 992.759
me

989.44 --> 994.9590000000001
cuz like thus far first episode it's

992.759 --> 997.9590000000001
it's tough to get through like I have to

994.959 --> 1000.16
watch this series like in in parts

997.959 --> 1005.2399999999999
because it's really rough it's basically

1000.16 --> 1010.36
about maest China in a part but then

1005.24 --> 1013.24
like oh science oh the the nice science

1010.36 --> 1018.0
it's so good and oh how dare they go

1013.24 --> 1020.12
after science oh no the big bang oh my

1018.0 --> 1022.319
God it's

1020.12 --> 1024.6
I'm sorry it's it's like

1022.319 --> 1028.6399999999999
mean-spirited but like when that

1024.6 --> 1031.76
Professor got like beaten to death over

1028.64 --> 1034.8390000000002
that I I couldn't help but laugh even

1031.76 --> 1037.679
though it's really brutal I mean it's

1034.839 --> 1039.799
nasty and especially the reason why

1037.679 --> 1042.919
because of boy you you leave a chance

1039.799 --> 1049.48
for God to exist how dare

1042.919 --> 1053.039
you but for it him like all science

1049.48 --> 1056.48
we the beginning of the UN it was just

1053.039 --> 1059.72
it I just couldn't help but laugh my ass

1056.48 --> 1062.76
off but later in the series also like in

1059.72 --> 1065.28
the episode it's just the first freaking

1062.76 --> 1070.76
episode they said some things that were

1065.28 --> 1073.24
like yeah like everything we believed in

1070.76 --> 1074.72
in the last 80 years turns out to be

1073.24 --> 1078.48
wrong through

1074.72 --> 1080.6000000000001
experiments like yeah oh oh you finally

1078.48 --> 1083.919
caught off did you you finally caught on

1080.6 --> 1089.6
that you were all wrong completely

1083.919 --> 1093.159
[Â __Â ] wrong did you huh yeah yeah

1089.6 --> 1097.3999999999999
that's right you were wrong you [Â __Â ]

1093.159 --> 1101.1200000000001
science idiots with your overpaid shitty

1097.4 --> 1104.8400000000001
bureaucratic job and your stupid degrees

1101.12 --> 1107.6399999999999
and your PE reviews yeah yeah you were

1104.84 --> 1110.72
wrong that's right everything that

1107.64 --> 1112.96
you've learned was wrong I really love

1110.72 --> 1114.64
that they put it in there and makes me

1112.96 --> 1117.52
very curious to see like where this is

1114.64 --> 1119.3600000000001
going to go and I get I I get the strong

1117.52 --> 1121.8799999999999
sense that there's some like weird time

1119.36 --> 1125.9599999999998
travel thing that's going to be involved

1121.88 --> 1128.1200000000001
in it because of the sort of the

1125.96 --> 1131.44
Traer that you got to

1128.12 --> 1134.32
see but uh it looks like it's going to

1131.44 --> 1137.559
be a very interesting series but very

1134.32 --> 1140.559
intense three body

1137.559 --> 1143.52
problem but yeah I I couldn't help but

1140.559 --> 1147.76
literally laugh over the

1143.52 --> 1152.48
ridiculous oh science is so

1147.76 --> 1156.32
amazing like the pseudo science [Â __Â ]

1152.48 --> 1160.48
belief planets and outer space and the

1156.32 --> 1162.3999999999999
big bang and Einstein nonsense because

1160.48 --> 1165.24
that is what it was basically that's

1162.4 --> 1167.72
what's the main characters are like

1165.24 --> 1170.72
basically Priests of

1167.72 --> 1170.72
that

1170.88 --> 1175.48
doing things with the large hron

1172.84 --> 1178.48
collider it's all super science

1175.48 --> 1178.48
themed

1188.679 --> 1195.52
so wi it is a professional put into this

1193.24 --> 1197.64
topic by what the hell are you talking

1195.52 --> 1199.8799999999999
about

1197.64 --> 1204.5200000000002
Clary

1199.88 --> 1204.5200000000002
not just an organic FL what industry

1209.12 --> 1217.76
yeah like and if if so geospatial

1214.84 --> 1220.6
intelligence agency oh really what's

1217.76 --> 1220.6
your proof for

1224.44 --> 1230.919
that that's uh quite the conspiracy

1228.24 --> 1234.36
theory there

1230.919 --> 1238.72
clear but I mean if so I'd like to thank

1234.36 --> 1238.7199999999998
the agency because he's

1241.919 --> 1247.88
great I mean except for The Ether [Â __Â ]

1244.96 --> 1251.3600000000001
but I mean it's really harmless I mean

1247.88 --> 1255.919
people can absolutely see through that

1251.36 --> 1261.3999999999999
now so if that is what he came in for

1255.919 --> 1261.4
then well that's not a problem it just

1267.64 --> 1274.6000000000001
isn't so

1270.919 --> 1278.5590000000002
yeah but yeah tell me more about

1274.6 --> 1280.84
this geospatial intelligence agency

1278.559 --> 1283.2
background of wits it gets it glary I'd

1280.84 --> 1284.9599999999998
love to hear about it love to see some

1283.2 --> 1287.52
sources

1284.96 --> 1291.919
some some proof for

1287.52 --> 1291.9189999999999
that that would be kind of

1295.68 --> 1298.89
[Music]

1299.44 --> 1304.3200000000002
interesting sure give you a minute yeah

1301.88 --> 1304.3200000000002
sure I

1307.73 --> 1313.32
[Music]

1310.96 --> 1317.52
will oh

1313.32 --> 1319.6399999999999
wi oh my God he still do the latter

1317.52 --> 1320.72
ones

1319.64 --> 1324.1200000000001
how

1320.72 --> 1327.0
dare yeah dude never get photographs

1324.12 --> 1329.279
standing next to a letter like your

1327.0 --> 1331.96
career is over after that point in the

1329.279 --> 1334.2
conspiracy theory

1331.96 --> 1339.4
World I'll make sure not to get

1334.2 --> 1339.4
photograph when I stand next to a letter

1347.52 --> 1350.52
God

1350.84 --> 1358.12
yeah then again I think that my whole

1353.32 --> 1360.6399999999999
Illuminati cassan or deal is probably

1358.12 --> 1365.3999999999999
already way bigger than that I mean

1360.64 --> 1370.2
people need to get a life in that

1365.4 --> 1370.2
seriously hey Bill n designs good to see

1376.64 --> 1380.44
you it's Buddy

1395.279 --> 1400.6
okay okay well that's cute thanks for

1399.24 --> 1403.6
that

1400.6 --> 1406.799
link yeah I guess that's the national

1403.6 --> 1409.36
special intelligence agency GE special

1406.799 --> 1413.2
so I don't see his name there in the

1409.36 --> 1413.1999999999998
list or any list at

1433.44 --> 1439.799
all bro I might be working for the

1437.44 --> 1443.159
geospatial intelligence

1439.799 --> 1446.1589999999999
agency like undercover not even knowing

1443.159 --> 1446.159
consciously that I

1446.2 --> 1454.0
am but I mean if so you're not going to

1449.6 --> 1454.0
be able to find me on some list anywhere

1454.12 --> 1460.08
so clearly have you realized that maybe

1457.36 --> 1462.6
you are actually secretly without you

1460.08 --> 1467.36
knowing a part of the geospatial

1462.6 --> 1470.36
intelligence agency you ever considered

1467.36 --> 1470.36
that

1478.88 --> 1485.48
we all are yes okay right so yeah think

1482.559 --> 1485.48
we can move on

1488.0 --> 1491.43
[Music]

1493.52 --> 1496.73
[Music]

1497.32 --> 1504.019
now

1500.2 --> 1504.019
[Music]

1510.48 --> 1512.799
it's

1518.679 --> 1525.039
hilarious I mean at that point

1522.039 --> 1528.08
like you got to wonder if like an

1525.039 --> 1533.08
intelligence agency like that even is

1528.08 --> 1537.1589999999999
real real or if it'ses just there so

1533.08 --> 1541.36
that people can have conspiracy theories

1537.159 --> 1544.44
about it and that is its intended

1541.36 --> 1547.279
influence right you're just

1544.44 --> 1549.64
like this is a Secret

1547.279 --> 1552.12
Agency yeah we don't tell anybody what

1549.64 --> 1557.24
we do or who we actually

1552.12 --> 1559.1999999999998
hire and uh yeah we're

1557.24 --> 1561.3990000000001
there

1559.2 --> 1564.8400000000001
and then people are like oh my God what

1561.399 --> 1567.039
did they do ah and then people just

1564.84 --> 1569.1999999999998
start to

1567.039 --> 1572.799
crystalize around

1569.2 --> 1575.8400000000001
it in anticipation when technically the

1572.799 --> 1578.72
whole agency could literally be a a

1575.84 --> 1582.08
hollow front that is just there to

1578.72 --> 1585.039
stimulate the conspiracy theory

1582.08 --> 1589.6399999999999
Community to do a certain thing in

1585.039 --> 1592.399
regards to it to look at things

1589.64 --> 1595.1200000000001
differently right that would be a really

1592.399 --> 1597.84
cheap way to influence

1595.12 --> 1600.6
society in which conspiracy theory

1597.84 --> 1604.039
thinking is rampant all you have to do

1600.6 --> 1607.0
is just create a

1604.039 --> 1609.559
front of a secret agency that doesn't

1607.0 --> 1612.0
actually do anything and then the entire

1609.559 --> 1613.1589999999999
community of the world will just respond

1612.0 --> 1616.159
to

1613.159 --> 1619.3600000000001
it it's a really cheap way to influence

1616.159 --> 1621.96
Society wouldn't you say not saying that

1619.36 --> 1623.84
this geospatial intelligence agency is

1621.96 --> 1625.76
fake

1623.84 --> 1630.12
but it

1625.76 --> 1630.12
could aspects of it could

1640.32 --> 1647.1589999999999
be why are modeling of the world oo

1644.72 --> 1650.159
mapping oh that's

1647.159 --> 1650.159
cute

1657.84 --> 1665.84
dueling factions for power really where

1662.08 --> 1665.84
the hell are you getting this from

1669.76 --> 1677.12
man dude do I need to make start making

1673.72 --> 1679.76
a uh tin foil hat at this

1677.12 --> 1681.8799999999999
point that's a cheap shot I hate when

1679.76 --> 1685.72
people say that but I mean seriously

1681.88 --> 1685.72
like where the hell are you getting this

1701.44 --> 1705.24
from over a wizard

1706.039 --> 1711.679
hat tin foil hats are wizard hats

1712.519 --> 1716.64
dummy what do you think is in those

1715.279 --> 1719.64
wizard

1716.64 --> 1719.64
hats

1729.84 --> 1734.6399999999999
nothing Decades of research oh

1737.039 --> 1740.039
really

1746.48 --> 1752.519
that sounds like a whole body of science

1749.799 --> 1752.519
argument to

1752.679 --> 1756.76
me got any concrete

1767.039 --> 1771.2
leads

1768.08 --> 1771.1999999999998
[Music]

1781.12 --> 1783.5189999999998
oh

1794.76 --> 1800.8799999999999
man oh man I'm trying to recall like

1797.72 --> 1803.2
something sometimes like weird wisdom

1800.88 --> 1804.919
Insight just comes rolling out of me

1803.2 --> 1807.1200000000001
like this title from yesterday I'm

1804.919 --> 1811.96
trying to remember I had

1807.12 --> 1811.9599999999998
a an upgrade to the

1814.519 --> 1820.2
saying

1816.88 --> 1823.7990000000002
uh wise men know they know

1820.2 --> 1826.44
nothing trying to recall what it was

1823.799 --> 1828.1589999999999
like I should make a habit of trying to

1826.44 --> 1832.24
write these things down when they come

1828.159 --> 1832.24
with it with it

1847.159 --> 1851.64
again something like being

1851.84 --> 1856.6789999999999
wise is not about knowing you know

1856.919 --> 1859.919
nothing

1862.08 --> 1868.1589999999999
but

1863.679 --> 1870.76
learning more about what you can know in

1868.159 --> 1870.7600000000002
order to

1871.12 --> 1878.2399999999998
become certain about the things you

1874.399 --> 1878.2399999999998
can't know yeah that was

1879.85 --> 1883.09
[Music]

1886.919 --> 1889.919
it

1898.98 --> 1903.829
[Applause]

1900.74 --> 1903.829
[Music]

1914.53 --> 1924.239
[Music]

1926.0 --> 1930.84
so it's

1927.799 --> 1933.679
basically not about knowing you know

1930.84 --> 1936.76
nothing but about finding certainty

1933.679 --> 1936.76
about what you can't

1943.08 --> 1946.08
know

1946.84 --> 1949.84
right

1952.08 --> 1957.1589999999999
learning about

1954.24 --> 1958.919
certainty or attaining certainty about

1957.159 --> 1960.48
what you can't

1958.919 --> 1963.3600000000001
know

1960.48 --> 1964.44
because everybody know everybody that

1963.36 --> 1967.279
has

1964.44 --> 1969.3600000000001
intellect and inspiration will always

1967.279 --> 1971.559
figure out that there's

1969.36 --> 1972.4399999999998
more that's of course where that saying

1971.559 --> 1976.72
comes

1972.44 --> 1976.72
from Wise Men knows they know

1976.84 --> 1981.6
nothing

1978.88 --> 1985.48
but a more constructive approach is to

1981.6 --> 1987.84
not just oh there's I can never know it

1985.48 --> 1992.32
all but to

1987.84 --> 1994.24
actually figure out what you can know

1992.32 --> 1997.72
and what you cannot

1994.24 --> 2002.0
know because that entire approach which

1997.72 --> 2003.48
is a more ying and yang approach of

2002.0 --> 2006.48
knowledge as a

2003.48 --> 2010.24
whole will also help

2006.48 --> 2013.24
you of void

2010.24 --> 2017.88
Illusions yeah and look at how riddled

2013.24 --> 2021.0
with Illusions knowledge has

2017.88 --> 2024.919
become first and foremost scientism and

2021.0 --> 2028.44
everything that it proclaims as

2024.919 --> 2032.919
knowledge well if you simply

2028.44 --> 2038.3990000000001
learn what you can't know then you can

2032.919 --> 2040.6390000000001
much easier avoid learning things that

2038.399 --> 2043.84
are

2040.639 --> 2048.359
false and having that

2043.84 --> 2050.119
knowledge confuse you about what is real

2048.359 --> 2053.7599999999998
because in the

2050.119 --> 2056.56
end with everything you get to learn

2053.76 --> 2059.679
knowing what is real and what isn't is

2056.56 --> 2063.0
the most important factor in order to

2059.679 --> 2063.0
explore what you have

2065.56 --> 2073.299
learned hell Jensen flat good see

2070.139 --> 2073.299
[Music]

2076.159 --> 2080.639
you contemplating the essence of God

2078.48 --> 2083.919
today yes

2080.639 --> 2086.839
indeed the title specifically applies to

2083.919 --> 2086.839
the

2088.079 --> 2094.44
philosophical foundations of Free Will

2092.0 --> 2094.44
versus

2094.919 --> 2099.64
determinism and I recognize that

2099.96 --> 2106.599
and I'm probably not the only one that

2102.079 --> 2110.8
both seem to be true even though they

2106.599 --> 2113.92
are in direct paradoxical opposition to

2110.8 --> 2117.599
one another but that paradoxical

2113.92 --> 2117.599
opposition may only be

2122.8 --> 2128.96
seemingly

2124.96 --> 2134.119
and what makes them

2128.96 --> 2136.4
sort of simultaneously true could be the

2134.119 --> 2139.92
quantum superposition of the conscious

2136.4 --> 2139.92
within regards to

2145.88 --> 2156.119
it so free will could be like a a

2150.68 --> 2158.319
separated thing within the web of

2156.119 --> 2162.319
predeterminism that is still still

2158.319 --> 2165.119
contain almost like a matrix

2162.319 --> 2167.52
effect like you really within the web of

2165.119 --> 2169.88
determinism have this free will to do

2167.52 --> 2172.04
things yet the consequences of the Free

2169.88 --> 2176.56
Will and its

2172.04 --> 2179.56
display seems to always have a reaction

2176.56 --> 2183.319
from the outside world from the other

2179.56 --> 2186.16
wheels that aren't as free and thus more

2183.319 --> 2188.92
into the real Road of

2186.16 --> 2191.52
determinism preet

2188.92 --> 2196.04
situations that

2191.52 --> 2198.8
because when you surrender toe preer

2196.04 --> 2202.0
predeterminism you basically surrender

2198.8 --> 2205.5600000000004
your free will also but there is

2202.0 --> 2208.44
something there for

2205.56 --> 2212.599
that it's the

2208.44 --> 2212.599
railroad it's the autopilot

2215.44 --> 2219.4
system so there is

2218.2 --> 2222.1189999999997
A

2219.4 --> 2225.48
system that even if you have no free

2222.119 --> 2228.2000000000003
will everything will roll out as

2225.48 --> 2229.359
determined but that same system accounts

2228.2 --> 2233.2799999999997
for

2229.359 --> 2237.2
The Logical chaos of absolute free

2233.28 --> 2237.2000000000003
will it accounts for

2241.68 --> 2248.0789999999997
it like within the web of PR

2244.52 --> 2251.48
predeterminism you have this free will

2248.079 --> 2254.4
that can change

2251.48 --> 2258.2400000000002
things at least with

2254.4 --> 2261.52
yourself and a limited influence around

2258.24 --> 2263.839
you but yeah it's very tricky because

2261.52 --> 2266.839
true Free Will

2263.839 --> 2266.839
is

2269.16 --> 2274.8799999999997
burdensome cuz it creates kind of a a

2272.44 --> 2278.2000000000003
chaos in the mind if you realize that

2274.88 --> 2281.599
you have true free will then you also

2278.2 --> 2287.1189999999997
realize that you can't know the future

2281.599 --> 2287.119
from that position from that super

2297.5 --> 2305.86
[Music]

2306.44 --> 2312.2400000000002
position

2309.28 --> 2315.3590000000004
happy people have choices yeah well it

2312.24 --> 2319.4399999999996
is a certain amount of

2315.359 --> 2322.88
energy that requires free will

2319.44 --> 2325.48
to manifest within the

2322.88 --> 2328.76
Consciousness if you have no energy then

2325.48 --> 2332.28
you are going to resort to an

2328.76 --> 2334.7200000000003
autopilot deterministic view of things

2332.28 --> 2338.1600000000003
you will just do whatever you do and

2334.72 --> 2339.64
what you look upon into the future is

2338.16 --> 2343.24
all

2339.64 --> 2343.24
very typical

2345.0 --> 2350.04
preset arguably somewhat demoralizing in

2353.76 --> 2360.5600000000004
ways but if you have enough energy then

2357.48 --> 2363.52
in that moment of energy you can break

2360.56 --> 2363.52
with that

2363.88 --> 2369.92
predeterminism seemingly but that

2366.56 --> 2373.44
seeming influence when the energy is

2369.92 --> 2379.319
held on to for long enough can

2373.44 --> 2383.56
truly break modus it can break that the

2379.319 --> 2383.56
before foreen break

2386.24 --> 2391.16
determinism yeah feeling trap is

2388.28 --> 2391.1600000000003
demoralization

2395.52 --> 2400.359
exactly so it's really all about finding

2398.2 --> 2400.359
the

2403.319 --> 2410.68
energy newr video nobody cares as long

2407.2 --> 2410.68
as they're not ripping my live

2426.319 --> 2432.13
stream

2428.47 --> 2432.1299999999997
[Music]

2446.96 --> 2454.16
yeah well we don't lar we're talking

2450.44 --> 2456.119
about heavy philosophy [Â __Â ] the trolls

2454.16 --> 2459.24
the only thing they want is for that to

2456.119 --> 2459.2400000000002
stop that's all

2465.88 --> 2469.52
right and I can't stop them from making

2467.8 --> 2472.96
stupid [Â __Â ]

2469.52 --> 2475.64
videos to try to downplay whatever I'm

2472.96 --> 2477.56
doing so that they can like live with

2475.64 --> 2481.68
themselves

2477.56 --> 2481.68
again in the face of my

2481.839 --> 2488.4
awesomeness which highlights their own

2485.0 --> 2492.8
pathetic nature

2488.4 --> 2496.17
so let them you know let them eat [Â __Â ]

2492.8 --> 2502.1600000000003
that's what they want to do and let

2496.17 --> 2504.599
[Music]

2502.16 --> 2508.64
them okay that's quite the statement

2504.599 --> 2508.6400000000003
there Jesus didn't have free will uh I

2508.88 --> 2512.6400000000003
disagree Free Will is

2516.24 --> 2520.8799999999997
choice

2518.64 --> 2522.839
but logically the thing about Free Will

2520.88 --> 2527.2400000000002
and choice is

2522.839 --> 2530.599
that you're not going to choose

2527.24 --> 2533.52
badly if it has real

2530.599 --> 2535.92
consequences unless you want to test the

2533.52 --> 2540.599
very nature of Free Will itself and

2535.92 --> 2540.599
choose badly specifically to see if you

2541.119 --> 2548.44
can don't think Jesus

2544.48 --> 2552.359
was willing to to make that

2548.44 --> 2553.92
test or at least not in his later years

2552.359 --> 2557.119
perhaps in his

2553.92 --> 2559.8
teens that's why that probably wasn't

2557.119 --> 2559.8
really written

2564.839 --> 2569.92
about do B loves tackle free will I'm

2567.48 --> 2569.92
sure he

2570.28 --> 2573.92
does I'm sure he

2574.68 --> 2580.5589999999997
does yeah but uh

2577.839 --> 2584.52
I mean you can bicker for one side all

2580.559 --> 2586.7200000000003
you want oh there is no free will yeah

2584.52 --> 2590.359
there is

2586.72 --> 2594.4399999999996
provably it's just a little complicated

2590.359 --> 2594.44
yeah it's a paradoxical

2596.24 --> 2602.9199999999996
simultaneity it's both true even though

2598.92 --> 2602.92
they're fundamentally

2606.119 --> 2610.559
incompatible

2608.96 --> 2612.16
and it's funny thing is they're not

2610.559 --> 2614.3590000000004
partially compatible they're

2612.16 --> 2616.0
fundamentally incompatible in every way

2614.359 --> 2619.4
and so they're almost like a ying and

2616.0 --> 2623.64
yang effect that despite their

2619.4 --> 2626.8
incompatibility do persist both of

2623.64 --> 2631.0789999999997
them that's where you get these nice

2626.8 --> 2634.76
little wizard words like paradoxical

2631.079 --> 2634.76
simultaneity trademark

2636.04 --> 2643.52
Arwin

2638.72 --> 2646.2
demons probably strafe him all day every

2643.52 --> 2648.72
day

2646.2 --> 2651.4399999999996
maybe they would have certainly tested

2648.72 --> 2653.3999999999996
him tested his patience it's patience

2651.44 --> 2658.0
with the world when you have wisdom like

2653.4 --> 2660.2400000000002
Jesus Christ did then all people are

2658.0 --> 2662.76
just like demons staring you in the face

2660.24 --> 2665.2799999999997
all the time all you can see is their

2662.76 --> 2668.079
ignorance and idiocy and all you hope

2665.28 --> 2671.92
for is that there's just some Sprouts of

2668.079 --> 2674.079
wisdom and energy like yours that might

2671.92 --> 2677.44
spring

2674.079 --> 2681.2000000000003
forth without just dying

2677.44 --> 2684.319
out I mean that from a personal vantage

2681.2 --> 2687.839
point I that would be my issue with the

2684.319 --> 2691.2799999999997
world if I had been Jesus Christ like

2687.839 --> 2694.04
just wishing that there would be more

2691.28 --> 2698.1600000000003
like him standing up and he even

2694.04 --> 2701.64
proclaimed that there will be others

2698.16 --> 2704.72
like me that will surpass

2701.64 --> 2709.04
me if he said that then that must have

2704.72 --> 2712.2799999999997
also been his hope it is a message of

2709.04 --> 2712.2799999999997
Hope his

2713.2 --> 2721.0789999999997
hope and it must have been

2716.76 --> 2721.079
true but nobody would hear

2722.119 --> 2725.96
it they couldn't imagine that that could

2724.96 --> 2728.96
be

2725.96 --> 2728.96
possible

2729.319 --> 2734.2
yeah that's right the closer you get to

2731.079 --> 2738.6400000000003
the Creator the closer devil pays

2734.2 --> 2741.7999999999997
attention to you it is true

2738.64 --> 2746.52
because the light of

2741.8 --> 2749.88
God and wisdom the enlightenment of God

2746.52 --> 2752.52
is a threat to the powers of this world

2749.88 --> 2754.319
to the control of this world which

2752.52 --> 2758.92
includes mind

2754.319 --> 2758.92
control and the enlightenment of God

2759.839 --> 2767.2
unshackles the minds of people so that

2763.559 --> 2769.8
is a threat to the powers of this world

2767.2 --> 2769.7999999999997
it's all

2781.839 --> 2785.92
logical you think that's why I'm being

2784.28 --> 2788.92
trolled

2785.92 --> 2788.92
yes

2803.599 --> 2811.76
right I threaten the simple Earthly

2807.559 --> 2814.119
order of predeterminism within people

2811.76 --> 2816.6400000000003
from their vantage point of

2814.119 --> 2817.96
weakness and unwillingness to overcome

2816.64 --> 2821.16
their own

2817.96 --> 2823.68
sins and that then drives people to

2821.16 --> 2829.0
bully those that

2823.68 --> 2832.64
do to try to socially put them beneath

2829.0 --> 2837.04
themselves so that their inner unrest

2832.64 --> 2837.04
can be dimmed that's how that

2845.839 --> 2848.839
happens

2864.99 --> 2868.1099999999997
[Music]

2873.76 --> 2879.28
like freedom of spirit and being being

2877.119 --> 2881.599
and Consciousness is a threat to those

2879.28 --> 2881.599
that are

2885.68 --> 2893.1189999999997
imprison because those are imprisoned

2888.4 --> 2895.76
are then confronted by with their

2893.119 --> 2898.44
imprisonment and that they should do

2895.76 --> 2898.44
something about

2900.839 --> 2911.24
it makes them feel bad about themselves

2905.599 --> 2914.88
it it it sprouts it it tinat it tines

2911.24 --> 2917.319
like the seed spiritual seed within to

2914.88 --> 2920.6800000000003
break out of that

2917.319 --> 2923.359
but they are still easily discouraged by

2920.68 --> 2927.3999999999996
the darkness to not do that so it just

2923.359 --> 2927.4
ends up in light that punishes

2935.72 --> 2938.72
them

2940.0 --> 2945.599
all

2940.96 --> 2945.599
right but I mean they have a function

2946.52 --> 2955.0
too like by the response of the darkness

2951.04 --> 2956.319
by the devil's Sprout spouting forth

2955.0 --> 2959.4
from the

2956.319 --> 2964.079
weak you can

2959.4 --> 2964.079
measure the level of your own

2965.72 --> 2968.72
light

2969.0 --> 2973.0
and you can measure the influence of

2971.559 --> 2977.8390000000004
your own

2973.0 --> 2981.96
light so if they were not there at all

2977.839 --> 2984.799
then those that actually travel and grow

2981.96 --> 2986.319
within the light they

2984.799 --> 2989.2
wouldn't

2986.319 --> 2991.839
see as

2989.2 --> 2993.5589999999997
well right if you're just blinded by

2991.839 --> 2998.2
light and there's no Shadows then you

2993.559 --> 2999.559
have no reference frames

2998.2 --> 3003.4399999999996
to orient

2999.559 --> 3006.92
yourself so in a way the weak and

3003.44 --> 3009.96
demonic are required in order to be able

3006.92 --> 3013.04
to determine where you are at within

3009.96 --> 3013.04

hello Brian Griffin where are

3055.64 --> 3058.64
you

3063.2 --> 3066.319
shaky videos of

3066.44 --> 3070.119
shift all righty

3072.0 --> 3078.559
then rocket launch channels yeah but

3075.0 --> 3080.96
come on why dude why would you do that

3078.559 --> 3084.7200000000003
though troll rocket launch channels I

3080.96 --> 3087.68
mean it's just nump trying to enjoy

3084.72 --> 3091.16
their science fiction

3087.68 --> 3094.04
it's like seriously that's

3091.16 --> 3097.8799999999997
like being in a movie theater and then

3094.04 --> 3100.24
just selling like haha that's fake like

3097.88 --> 3102.04
yeah it's a

3100.24 --> 3106.1189999999997
movie

3102.04 --> 3109.68
like I know you want to point out like

3106.119 --> 3109.6800000000003
that it's nonsense and all that

3110.72 --> 3117.0789999999997
but don't you think that those people

3113.44 --> 3120.319
would have already figured out that

3117.079 --> 3122.48
there's something like rocket launch and

3120.319 --> 3126.24
Globe Earth Skeptics out there if they

3122.48 --> 3126.2400000000002
were really interested they'd go

3127.24 --> 3132.72
there there's a lot of people that just

3129.799 --> 3136.599
want to watch rocket launches

3132.72 --> 3138.9199999999996
because they are quite weak and are in

3136.599 --> 3142.599
desperate need of this reversed World

3138.92 --> 3144.799
illusion of futuristic progress and it

3142.599 --> 3147.2000000000003
just gives them a little bit of Hope and

3144.799 --> 3150.16
courage like oh yeah we're going to go

3147.2 --> 3153.3999999999996
there someday I mean why would you want

3150.16 --> 3153.3999999999996
to deprive them of

3163.62 --> 3168.0
[Music]

3165.119 --> 3172.119
that

3168.0 --> 3174.319
right I mean at best go in there and

3172.119 --> 3178.44
give them some hints but don't just like

3174.319 --> 3178.44
troll them that's just rude

3188.16 --> 3193.7599999999998
find this whole experience wild yeah it

3190.119 --> 3196.559
is wild I mean waking up to Flat Earth

3193.76 --> 3199.3190000000004
is a wild wild ride I mean just

3196.559 --> 3204.2000000000003
realizing like wow the entire world

3199.319 --> 3208.0
like big big percentage of the world is

3204.2 --> 3211.319
drowning in a reverse World r reality

3208.0 --> 3214.319
delusion that is being heavily

3211.319 --> 3214.319
reinforced

3217.88 --> 3222.2000000000003
systematically desperately at this point

3220.96 --> 3225.359
there's a

3222.2 --> 3225.359
desperation in

3225.68 --> 3233.0789999999997
it CU also there is

3228.68 --> 3236.5589999999997
no end point to it the only way the

3233.079 --> 3239.96
whole globe religion really survives is

3236.559 --> 3243.799
by there always being more because it is

3239.96 --> 3246.52
based on futurism and that means that

3243.799 --> 3250.68
there is never a point where it can stop

3246.52 --> 3253.359
there always needs to be more more time

3250.68 --> 3256.52
to waste never reaching the end because

3253.359 --> 3259.24
if you reach the end then Naturally by

3256.52 --> 3261.319
the nature of it all you figure out it

3259.24 --> 3263.4799999999996
was all

3261.319 --> 3267.0
[Â __Â ] and

3263.48 --> 3270.2
so everything they do is all about like

3267.0 --> 3272.68
just continuing the journey

3270.2 --> 3273.7599999999998
futurism Promises of the future that you

3272.68 --> 3278.2
will never

3273.76 --> 3278.2000000000003
see that's how they have to construct

3292.119 --> 3297.2400000000002
it will they ever tired of stuff like

3294.64 --> 3301.24
faking rocket launches no

3297.24 --> 3301.24
dude I don't even Tire of

3303.28 --> 3309.48
it I mean to me it's just like luxurious

3315.48 --> 3321.68
fireworks like I can my Ballwin side can

3319.079 --> 3323.6800000000003
still enjoy it somewhat it's just that

3321.68 --> 3326.3999999999996
all these people that're like oh we're

3323.68 --> 3328.96
winning off the Flat Earth that part is

3326.4 --> 3331.44
like just totally

3328.96 --> 3334.96
[Â __Â ] but I like the

3331.44 --> 3337.799
dream I like the space dream I like

3334.96 --> 3338.599
space movies I like the fantasy I like

3337.799 --> 3341.96
the

3338.599 --> 3341.96
creativity behind

3343.079 --> 3352.6800000000003
it it's just that it's not real

3346.839 --> 3352.68
though it's an amazing constructed dream

3354.079 --> 3360.4
world that is being

3357.96 --> 3362.15
shared and portrayed and taught like it

3360.4 --> 3365.2690000000002

3365.92 --> 3370.079

3370.52 --> 3377.68
you space and zombies

3374.319 --> 3377.68
yeah Space

3383.68 --> 3388.3999999999996
Zombies right that's the price you want

3386.72 --> 3390.5589999999997
space you want it to be real you want to

3388.4 --> 3395.2400000000002
go there you're going to turn into

3390.559 --> 3395.2400000000002
zombies so they are like a Sim

3396.039 --> 3404.0
simultaneous

3398.119 --> 3405.76
result space futurism the lufer side and

3404.0 --> 3409.88
the zombie

3405.76 --> 3409.88
apocalypse is the aramon

3415.24 --> 3418.24
side

3419.2 --> 3422.68
hey seeking star water good to see

3424.359 --> 3428.72
you infinity and beyond

3443.2 --> 3448.2799999999997
these yeah Richard now musk really want

3446.16 --> 3449.92
wants to take up that Turf

3448.28 --> 3453.76
within

3449.92 --> 3458.359
futurism I mean the people that are into

3453.76 --> 3461.76
that are kind of like you got to

3458.359 --> 3465.799
realize the rocket people the space

3461.76 --> 3469.5200000000004
people the astronomy fans they don't

3465.799 --> 3472.319
like it that there is seemingly no

3469.52 --> 3475.48
progress they're catching on to the

3472.319 --> 3477.2
Eternal cycle of false promises they

3475.48 --> 3480.599
don't like

3477.2 --> 3483.72
so there are some people that are trying

3480.599 --> 3487.2000000000003
just trying to really take it a Step

3483.72 --> 3489.72
Beyond and like can we fake a thing

3487.2 --> 3492.72
forever like the ISS is one of those

3489.72 --> 3496.839
things it's a thing they faked for quite

3492.72 --> 3500.24
a while it's a step a progress into that

3496.839 --> 3503.0789999999997
futurism into that fake

3500.24 --> 3506.68
reality people want

3503.079 --> 3509.6400000000003
more but it's dangerous though because

3506.68 --> 3512.0
the more you give them of this fake

3509.64 --> 3516.64
reality the more they

3512.0 --> 3517.76
expect yeah and that is like it is

3516.64 --> 3520.72
doomed

3517.76 --> 3523.0
eventually cuz if you're going to like

3520.72 --> 3525.48
yeah we're actually doing it we just

3523.0 --> 3527.559
built a moon base we're going to use it

3525.48 --> 3530.48
to explore the rest and like yeah we're

3527.559 --> 3533.2000000000003
actually now officially sending

3530.48 --> 3536.72
missions from there and like here's the

3533.2 --> 3538.52
footage dude everybody goes ballist when

3536.72 --> 3543.0389999999998
that happens when it is like made

3538.52 --> 3546.64
official and they will demand more more

3543.039 --> 3551.2400000000002
more evidence more footage we want a

3546.64 --> 3554.44
247 Moonbase stream now now and we want

3551.24 --> 3557.799
to be able to see the Earth in orbit

3554.44 --> 3561.28
like all that like the demands would

3557.799 --> 3561.28
just go out of the

3561.4 --> 3568.52
roof and so it only leads to more

3566.64 --> 3571.72
they want more and

3568.52 --> 3572.68
like there's only one inevitable outcome

3571.72 --> 3576.24
and that

3572.68 --> 3579.0
is there will be a failure to provide

3576.24 --> 3583.16
because you can't expand the illusion

3579.0 --> 3583.16
farther and farther it's just not

3586.44 --> 3593.119
doable and the further you push those

3588.88 --> 3595.4
boundaries the higher the risk of total

3593.119 --> 3597.92
collapse where it will like totally

3595.4 --> 3600.6800000000003
collapse like like literally curtain

3597.92 --> 3605.0
dropping

3600.68 --> 3608.0
collapse which would have a catastrophic

3605.0 --> 3608.0
influence

3608.24 --> 3612.16
on on all the space

3620.2 --> 3626.0
Believers but yeah I mean people have

3623.88 --> 3627.96
this ambition and I think Elon Musk has

3626.0 --> 3632.119
that ambition he wants to really be a

3627.96 --> 3635.079
futurist he wants to expand into

3632.119 --> 3637.7200000000003
the

3635.079 --> 3640.7200000000003
yeah Into the

3637.72 --> 3640.72
Mystic

3641.079 --> 3647.6400000000003
Realms with his technology and his CGI

3644.76 --> 3650.2000000000003
and he wants to do that he wants to

3647.64 --> 3651.72
somehow be that guy that's going to take

3650.2 --> 3654.72
it further

3651.72 --> 3657.9599999999996
because it's what he

3654.72 --> 3661.48
wants and I really also do Wonder like

3657.96 --> 3664.96
does he actually know

3661.48 --> 3666.76
fully about the nature of the realm is

3664.96 --> 3669.559
he using these

3666.76 --> 3672.8390000000004
opportunities to actually expand

3669.559 --> 3675.599
knowledge about the reality of the realm

3672.839 --> 3678.0789999999997
or is he just there as this futurist

3675.599 --> 3681.52
Entertainer that just wants to be the

3678.079 --> 3684.039
futurist guy that brings the dream

3681.52 --> 3687.92
further I don't know if he

3684.039 --> 3690.5200000000004
has actual EXP exploratory

3687.92 --> 3693.079
interests that he's keeping secret that

3690.52 --> 3693.079
he would have

3714.839 --> 3719.72
to don't know what you're talking about

3717.2 --> 3721.64
seeking star what what Psychopathic

3719.72 --> 3723.9599999999996
control

3721.64 --> 3726.839
what what are you talking about crate

3723.96 --> 3726.839
why are you bringing that

3733.119 --> 3739.6800000000003
up nobody gives a

3736.72 --> 3742.279
[Â __Â ] nobody gives a [Â __Â ] about the

3739.68 --> 3744.839
shitty anti Flat Earth channels don't

3742.279 --> 3748.2
bring them

3744.839 --> 3748.2
up they

3754.839 --> 3760.88
suck don't pollute my chat with that

3758.24 --> 3763.5989999999997
nonsense we're having a really good

3760.88 --> 3763.599
conversation

3765.319 --> 3770.72
here all right talking about which I'm

3768.039 --> 3774.3190000000004
going to turn on my coffee and get in

3770.72 --> 3774.319
Lumina so I'll be right

3774.839 --> 3777.839
back

3804.76 --> 3807.76
for

3834.72 --> 3837.72
for

3861.119 --> 3866.44
yeah so don't bring that

3864.48 --> 3869.52
up yeah

3866.44 --> 3869.52
stop talking about

3871.359 --> 3877.279
it you want to talk about that go to

3874.359 --> 3878.72
another forum and blabber on about that

3877.279 --> 3882.44
useless

3878.72 --> 3882.4399999999996
nonsense not in my

3886.16 --> 3891.319
chat excited about the

3889.559 --> 3893.599
eclipse

3891.319 --> 3897.64
yeah well the eclipse

3893.599 --> 3897.6400000000003
is a major

3897.799 --> 3904.16
event it is so major that the founders

3902.44 --> 3908.119
of the

3904.16 --> 3914.52
country anticipated it and

3908.119 --> 3916.799
named a whole bunch of cities n in its

3914.52 --> 3919.319
pathway which must have been

3916.799 --> 3924.079
specifically in anticipation of this

3919.319 --> 3927.64
Celestial event so yeah it is very

3924.079 --> 3927.6400000000003
exciting it's very

3929.2 --> 3938.0
positive it is a in my opinion in my

3934.0 --> 3940.68
prediction a phoenix Turning Point as

3938.0 --> 3940.68
I've been talking

3942.44 --> 3952.839
about because what is it what does it

3945.799 --> 3958.68
signify nin in the Bible is a moment of

3952.839 --> 3958.68
Confrontation like stop stop the

3969.799 --> 3973.319
sinning that's what it

3973.76 --> 3978.6400000000003
signifies I personally think that

3977.119 --> 3980.279
there's a good

3978.64 --> 3983.72
chance

3980.279 --> 3986.52
that the old deep State as you've been

3983.72 --> 3989.0389999999998
getting to see it the whole discuss ing

3986.52 --> 3990.64
self-destructive Marxist

3989.039 --> 3995.3590000000004
communist

3990.64 --> 3997.839
satanic government [Â __Â ] is going to

3995.359 --> 3999.799
basically

3997.839 --> 4003.96
be

3999.799 --> 4006.92
removed and replaced by the newer deep

4003.96 --> 4008.559
State the Phoenix event because I'm not

4006.92 --> 4011.039
kidding like there's not going to be a

4008.559 --> 4013.559
Grassroots

4011.039 --> 4015.039
thing there's going to be the other side

4013.559 --> 4018.119
of the deep state that are going to take

4015.039 --> 4020.279
over and it's going to be way better

4018.119 --> 4022.1600000000003
when that happens way

4020.279 --> 4026.48
better

4022.16 --> 4029.3999999999996
but also it will become quite apparent

4026.48 --> 4032.48
after not too much time passed that it

4029.4 --> 4035.839
is still the same deep

4032.48 --> 4040.359
state but at least like it will be the

4035.839 --> 4040.359
end of like all this disgusting

4040.44 --> 4048.64
influence will be an end of the

4044.52 --> 4048.64
embarrassment of the United

4049.079 --> 4055.0
States so that's

4052.48 --> 4058.44
something also there seems to be a just

4055.0 --> 4062.0
a huge amount of energy

4058.44 --> 4064.799
somehow surrounding this Celestial event

4062.0 --> 4069.0
that I can like palpably feel and have

4064.799 --> 4071.4
for like over a week already it's really

4069.0 --> 4074.24
building up and then I'm I'm being

4071.4 --> 4076.0
capable of actually condensing it and

4074.24 --> 4079.24
using it for

4076.0 --> 4079.24
more intellectual

4080.96 --> 4086.2400000000002
insights it's almost like my wizard

4083.559 --> 4087.279
power increased or something during this

4086.24 --> 4090.5589999999997
time

4087.279 --> 4092.559
period which also means that if that is

4090.559 --> 4096.0
really a thing and it's not permanent

4092.559 --> 4098.04
then it will also build down again which

4096.0 --> 4099.96
in a way is kind of comforting because

4098.04 --> 4104.44
like

4099.96 --> 4107.44
just having all this is kind of

4104.44 --> 4107.44
intense

4117.08 --> 4120.759
so there's a lot of energy going

4121.08 --> 4127.88
around energy for enlightenment very

4124.319 --> 4130.1990000000005
specific type so great opportunity for a

4127.88 --> 4132.6
lot of people that have been stuck in

4130.199 --> 4135.759
the darkness and ignorance for a very

4132.6 --> 4138.88
long time to be capable ofing breaking

4135.759 --> 4140.52
out and and flipping that around so like

4138.88 --> 4143.08
As Above So

4140.52 --> 4144.080000000001
Below in the grand scale and in the

4143.08 --> 4146.48
small

4144.08 --> 4148.719
scale a phoenix

4146.48 --> 4151.959999999999
event casting

4148.719 --> 4151.96
off the

4153.279 --> 4162.679
old the Earthly and being

4158.199 --> 4166.3589999999995
reborn like on a national level but also

4162.679 --> 4168.6
on an individual level there's like a

4166.359 --> 4172.04
turning point for a lot of people that

4168.6 --> 4174.359
can after having Decades of resisted

4172.04 --> 4177.199
everything conspiracy theory that will

4174.359 --> 4181.279
suddenly turn around and with great

4177.199 --> 4183.159
great energy turn around not just like

4181.279 --> 4185.56
oh damn it it turns out I was wrong all

4183.159 --> 4190.2789999999995
along okay let me slowly figure it out

4185.56 --> 4193.52
no with like a a tur of the

4190.279 --> 4195.84
switch like they became like they are

4193.52 --> 4199.2390000000005
instantly understanding it everything

4195.84 --> 4201.88
that they held back that kind of

4199.239 --> 4203.48
transformation it's happening and it's

4201.88 --> 4207.1990000000005
will happen

4203.48 --> 4207.199
more around this

4211.679 --> 4217.159
time yeah whatever

4214.88 --> 4219.08
clear validation yeah well the

4217.159 --> 4222.48
validation is

4219.08 --> 4224.32
already going on out

4222.48 --> 4226.718999999999
there in

4224.32 --> 4231.12
ways

4226.719 --> 4233.4
but I mean it just resulted in a more a

4231.12 --> 4235.5599999999995
higher contrast between the sleepers and

4233.4 --> 4235.5599999999995
the

4241.199 --> 4245.44
awaken no there's no operation there

4244.08 --> 4248.12
Jansen flat

4245.44 --> 4250.96
foot there's no operation that has

4248.12 --> 4250.96
anything to do with

4251.04 --> 4257.239
it this is just

4254.239 --> 4257.239
consciousness

4262.199 --> 4269.159
no military well there might be some

4266.36 --> 4270.96
military involved if like the new deep

4269.159 --> 4272.879999999999
State's going to take over from the old

4270.96 --> 4275.32
deep

4272.88 --> 4277.04
state but it has nothing to do with

4275.32 --> 4280.199
people's personal spiritual

4277.04 --> 4280.199
transformation at

4284.239 --> 4287.239
all

4302.97 --> 4306.209
[Music]

4314.239 --> 4317.239
for

4320.239 --> 4324.718999999999
besides just look at your military like

4322.92 --> 4329.8
what the hell are they supposed to be

4324.719 --> 4329.8
doing what can they even do at this this

4340.32 --> 4347.159
point hey clutch good to see

4344.159 --> 4347.159
you

4374.12 --> 4377.12
for

4382.88 --> 4387.88
but I'm still wondering

4384.719 --> 4390.96
like is a good chance I'm now thinking

4387.88 --> 4393.4800000000005
about it that the whole Neve eclipse and

4390.96 --> 4396.96
the energies that are released are

4393.48 --> 4401.36
literally waking people up flipping them

4396.96 --> 4401.36
around from their passive

4401.52 --> 4405.76
position including in the Deep State and

4404.44 --> 4407.5599999999995
in the military

4405.76 --> 4410.04
that they've been kind of standing by

4407.56 --> 4411.88
and they might it might be the starting

4410.04 --> 4414.28
signal of it I'm not sure like if

4411.88 --> 4416.639
there's like a coup going to happen like

4414.28 --> 4418.759999999999
directly in April or

4416.639 --> 4421.56
something but there's a good chance that

4418.76 --> 4426.320000000001
the people that will end up doing

4421.56 --> 4429.4800000000005
it are going to be like highly

4426.32 --> 4431.199
energized because of the eclipse because

4429.48 --> 4434.28
of the energies that are going around

4431.199 --> 4435.919999999999
that they're infused and that to a point

4434.28 --> 4440.5199999999995
where they

4435.92 --> 4442.4400000000005
have to then bring it to a resolve bring

4440.52 --> 4445.040000000001
it to its

4442.44 --> 4449.199
conclusion that they know like there is

4445.04 --> 4451.4
no more time to postpone it like they

4449.199 --> 4456.96
will be infused by you could say the

4451.4 --> 4460.0
Phoenix energy to eventually do it and

4456.96 --> 4464.04
maybe that will

4460.0 --> 4465.56
happen in the summer or maybe it will

4464.04 --> 4468.56
happen

4465.56 --> 4471.4800000000005
right after the elections

4468.56 --> 4474.88
and or around who

4471.48 --> 4478.239
knows but I mean the darkness is going

4474.88 --> 4480.4400000000005
to try to resist it CU they are

4478.239 --> 4482.678999999999
convinced that they've already won and

4480.44 --> 4485.239
that like they can just steal elections

4482.679 --> 4485.2390000000005
out in the

4486.48 --> 4491.159
open so some kind of force will have to

4489.84 --> 4493.32
be

4491.159 --> 4497.159
used and I think those that are going to

4493.32 --> 4498.92
do it are going to get really infused

4497.159 --> 4502.879999999999
with that Phoenix

4498.92 --> 4506.159
energy during this eclipse and around it

4502.88 --> 4506.159000000001
they might already be feeling

4512.07 --> 4515.188999999999
[Music]

4523.96 --> 4528.96
it

4526.639 --> 4531.04
military

4528.96 --> 4533.88
outnumbered yeah but that doesn't really

4531.04 --> 4533.88
matter too much

4534.08 --> 4539.0
clutch the migrant Army doesn't have

4536.719 --> 4542.88
Hightech Weaponry available to

4539.0 --> 4546.8
them unless they will and then it's real

4542.88 --> 4552.159000000001
serious Civil War or not well civil

4546.8 --> 4552.159000000001
yeah but uh don't count on

4553.92 --> 4556.92
it

4558.44 --> 4564.759999999999
brother that Force might have to be yeah

4560.719 --> 4568.0
but not against that that is after all

4564.76 --> 4569.88
that that's the aftermath that is the

4568.0 --> 4572.28
cleaning up the

4569.88 --> 4575.52
mess which will take

4572.28 --> 4579.239
years now I'm talking about Force to

4575.52 --> 4582.040000000001
unseat the current deep state

4579.239 --> 4585.718999999999
government to unseed those players and

4582.04 --> 4588.36
to arrest them for crimes Against

4585.719 --> 4590.76
Humanity and treachery against the

4588.36 --> 4593.679
country to make that

4590.76 --> 4596.280000000001
serious they they're not just going to

4593.679 --> 4598.92
like oh oh I'm arrested oh I'll just

4596.28 --> 4602.84
come with you no that has to be used

4598.92 --> 4606.28
Force they will have their

4602.84 --> 4609.52
teams to stop that there will have to be

4606.28 --> 4613.48
some Force used to basically make that

4609.52 --> 4616.84
maneuver and arrest those

4613.48 --> 4616.839999999999
people in the

4624.679 --> 4629.639
government taking over houses right yeah

4627.04 --> 4631.92
but that's mostly in Canada because can

4629.639 --> 4634.92
Canadian police is

4631.92 --> 4634.92
[Â __Â ]

4638.679 --> 4647.36
clutch all you have to do is just not do

4642.96 --> 4647.36
that just get your weapons

4650.12 --> 4658.04
ready it is in the U yeah some in the us

4654.52 --> 4661.639
too but uh I mean that's been going on

4658.04 --> 4663.639
for a while now and that will be

4661.639 --> 4666.04
addressed but that's not what I was

4663.639 --> 4666.04
talking

4667.76 --> 4675.08
about first the government the

4672.48 --> 4679.08
illegitimate satanic communist this

4675.08 --> 4681.96
Marxist government needs to be

4679.08 --> 4683.8
unseeded replaced and that will happen

4681.96 --> 4686.84
quickly and

4683.8 --> 4689.96
then everything else can be addressed

4686.84 --> 4689.96
and it will take a

4692.4 --> 4697.5199999999995
while like then the situation can be

4694.84 --> 4700.04
turned around because all this crazy

4697.52 --> 4704.120000000001
illegal immigrant Invasion [Â __Â ] out

4700.04 --> 4707.0
there is happening because the current

4704.12 --> 4709.84
illegitimate government literally openly

4707.0 --> 4713.48
greenlights that and like encourage

4709.84 --> 4715.88
those [Â __Â ] insane scumbags to do that

4713.48 --> 4719.5599999999995
in the open yeah that's why that's

4715.88 --> 4721.12
happening if that suddenly stops then

4719.56 --> 4725.1990000000005
everything

4721.12 --> 4728.239
changes you have to realize that they're

4725.199 --> 4731.879999999999
only doing it like this as brazenly as

4728.239 --> 4735.759999999999
they are because they have a fullblown

4731.88 --> 4738.4400000000005
green light from the government to do

4735.76 --> 4738.4400000000005
that

4744.45 --> 4747.59
[Music]

4755.159 --> 4758.159
clutch

4762.679 --> 4769.04
yeah yeah so expect that to

4766.239 --> 4772.199
end that's what I'm talking about don't

4769.04 --> 4775.12
focus on that [Â __Â ] especially not now

4772.199 --> 4777.08
don't get carried away and I mean I I

4775.12 --> 4778.8
know look who's talking I get carried

4777.08 --> 4784.4
away I got carried

4778.8 --> 4784.400000000001
away recently but don't do that here

4785.92 --> 4791.2390000000005
though just don't worry about it as soon

4788.88 --> 4793.84
as the Phoenix event

4791.239 --> 4796.159
happens this illegitimate government in

4793.84 --> 4797.52
the United States is stopped and

4796.159 --> 4800.719
replaced

4797.52 --> 4804.84
rapidly all of that crap out there all

4800.719 --> 4808.4800000000005
that devil ho [Â __Â ] all that demonic [Â __Â ]

4804.84 --> 4811.400000000001
is going to end and first it will end in

4808.48 --> 4814.4
spirit it will realize that it's time of

4811.4 --> 4817.44
a free demonic Reign is over they will

4814.4 --> 4818.36
all realize that all of them they will

4817.44 --> 4822.08
know

4818.36 --> 4823.32
it and that that alone will change

4822.08 --> 4826.159
everything

4823.32 --> 4828.639
dramatically just by the knowledge

4826.159 --> 4831.92
reaching

4828.639 --> 4835.96
them yeah and

4831.92 --> 4837.56
then things change they'll go more into

4835.96 --> 4841.84
secrecy in the background they will

4837.56 --> 4845.320000000001
still try to do what they did and then

4841.84 --> 4849.719
the Hunt is on then the new government

4845.32 --> 4849.719
is going to start to take care of

4853.639 --> 4856.639
it

4859.9 --> 4863.099999999999
[Music]

4864.0 --> 4869.84
yeah well Lou Alcott it's not really

4866.08 --> 4873.28
hilarious it is extremely worrisome it

4869.84 --> 4876.4800000000005
is the most idiotic out of control thing

4873.28 --> 4879.759999999999
that's ever occurred in in world history

4876.48 --> 4881.759999999999
pretty much so yeah it's very logical

4879.76 --> 4883.56
that people are worrying about the US

4881.76 --> 4885.400000000001
government they are completely out of

4883.56 --> 4888.1990000000005
control

4885.4 --> 4892.199
and they're like instigating war and

4888.199 --> 4894.4
[Â __Â ] and doing terrible things

4892.199 --> 4897.879999999999
besieging their own

4894.4 --> 4897.879999999999
country it is

4901.08 --> 4907.6
terrible it has been

4903.52 --> 4911.4400000000005
terrible but way I see it it's going to

4907.6 --> 4913.4400000000005
be drawn to an end very

4911.44 --> 4917.919999999999
soon all right I'm going to get my

4913.44 --> 4917.919999999999
Illuminati kasan coffee be right

4943.52 --> 4946.52

5013.159 --> 5021.5199999999995
it will be taken care of is what I'm

5017.76 --> 5023.639
saying one way or the

5021.52 --> 5026.92
other

5023.639 --> 5030.56
yeah a giant natural hazard-based

5026.92 --> 5030.56
accident might just

5033.44 --> 5036.44
occur

5045.92 --> 5049.01
[Music]

5060.28 --> 5065.599999999999
yeah so clutch all of you guys please

5063.52 --> 5069.719
could you just tell it down starting to

5065.6 --> 5071.280000000001
piss me off right but yes if the Phoenix

5069.719 --> 5073.04
event occurs the government's take it

5071.28 --> 5076.639
down yeah it could literally be the

5073.04 --> 5078.639
starting CLE of a total Civil War that

5076.639 --> 5081.04
breaks out in which there will be

5078.639 --> 5084.400000000001
constant gunfire it will be like a

5081.04 --> 5087.159
ground war with massive weapons but I

5084.4 --> 5090.32
mean as soon as the military is

5087.159 --> 5092.28
basically ready to address that you

5090.32 --> 5094.0
really think that these [Â __Â ] illegal

5092.28 --> 5095.28
migrants doing that are going to last

5094.0 --> 5098.04
very long

5095.28 --> 5101.5199999999995
they will be [Â __Â ]

5098.04 --> 5101.5199999999995
erased okay

5102.48 --> 5107.239
erased if they're like going to actually

5105.119 --> 5112.08
go full Civil War like

5107.239 --> 5113.678999999999
that they have no [Â __Â ] chance at all

5112.08 --> 5117.239
as soon as the

5113.679 --> 5120.28
military gets involved no

5117.239 --> 5122.879999999999
chance like absolutely not it will be

5120.28 --> 5124.92
like an exemplary demonstration to the

5122.88 --> 5127.52
world what [Â __Â ] happens

5124.92 --> 5130.2390000000005
when you openly invade the United States

5127.52 --> 5132.76
when the government is in order that's

5130.239 --> 5132.759999999999

5137.2 --> 5140.3
[Music]

5173.52 --> 5178.639
United States is not a world power

5175.239 --> 5182.599999999999
anymore and besides nobody [Â __Â ] wants

5178.639 --> 5184.8
them anymore it's over yeah United

5182.6 --> 5187.56
States can attempt to reest establish

5184.8 --> 5189.92
some kind of world power like that we'll

5187.56 --> 5194.280000000001
have to start all over

5189.92 --> 5196.32
again and that's a fact there's nothing

5194.28 --> 5199.119
that can change that they've already

5196.32 --> 5202.599999999999
lost world

associate with the United States

5223.48 --> 5229.159

single [Â __Â ] person in the entire

5237.52 --> 5243.679
[Â __Â ] world hearing about it will say

5241.119 --> 5246.759999999999
it's the [Â __Â ] United States because

5243.679 --> 5246.76

5307.8 --> 5314.28
those illegal immigrants yeah yes

5311.4 --> 5316.759999999999
there's a lot of like militants in there

5314.28 --> 5318.679
that are disgusting communist

5316.76 --> 5321.0
revolutionaries and they will cause

5318.679 --> 5324.28
havoc and they will be disgusting

5321.0 --> 5326.76
criminals and slaughter people and they

5324.28 --> 5329.44
will be taken care of and it will happen

5326.76 --> 5334.360000000001
way quicker than anybody can

5329.44 --> 5337.638999999999
foresee okay but then there's a whole

5334.36 --> 5341.159
whole bunch of migrants that are

5337.639 --> 5344.1990000000005
actually kind of good and they will

5341.159 --> 5346.0
be accepted into the United States by

5344.199 --> 5348.719
the new deep State they will be

5346.0 --> 5353.4
integrated and they will

5348.719 --> 5355.119
be a part of revitalizing the US economy

5353.4 --> 5358.119
that's what's going to

5355.119 --> 5358.119
happen

5362.639 --> 5368.679
understand it's the United States way

5365.56 --> 5372.6
it's always been like

5368.679 --> 5375.84
that it's it's just that the whole

5372.6 --> 5378.08
satanic I'll just call him Biden regime

5375.84 --> 5382.32
has basically tried to weaponize the

5378.08 --> 5384.84
migration system to destroy the United

5382.32 --> 5386.92
States but just because that happened

5384.84 --> 5389.96
and it has to be stopped does it mean

5386.92 --> 5394.4
that that the whole system that the

5389.96 --> 5397.92
United States has for centuries is just

5394.4 --> 5399.96
going to then change it won't there's

5397.92 --> 5402.56
giant amounts of migrants that are

5399.96 --> 5404.32
actually there to they really want to be

5402.56 --> 5406.96
part of the United

5404.32 --> 5409.639
States they don't really like the gangs

5406.96 --> 5412.88
they don't really like the the communism

5409.639 --> 5415.1990000000005
[Â __Â ] and they'll be very happy when

5412.88 --> 5418.400000000001
the Phoenix event happens when all the

5415.199 --> 5421.119
disgusting criminals are burnt off and

5418.4 --> 5424.638999999999
then they'll be welcomed in to help

5421.119 --> 5426.759999999999
repopulate the United States and be a

5424.639 --> 5428.719
new labor force and they will be very

5426.76 --> 5431.280000000001

best to learn English and learn about

5519.199 --> 5526.879999999999
something it's electronic payment you

5521.92 --> 5530.04
could just turn off block you never

5526.88 --> 5532.84
heard of a credit card getting

5530.04 --> 5536.4
blocked I mean seriously you don't seem

5532.84 --> 5536.400000000001
to really understand how that

5536.48 --> 5541.03
[Music]

5542.84 --> 5547.569
works

5544.54 --> 5547.569
[Music]

5568.81 --> 5571.999000000001
[Music]

5572.84 --> 5575.84
for

5576.6 --> 5579.639
[Music]

5586.119 --> 5591.32
oh you understand sarcasm do you do you

5589.56 --> 5594.88
also understand that there's

5591.32 --> 5598.96
consequences of being disruptive in my

5594.88 --> 5598.96
chat and pissing people

5599.29 --> 5602.399
[Music]

5602.76 --> 5605.76
off

5615.48 --> 5618.629999999999
[Music]

5631.96 --> 5636.159
even if those credit cards were

5634.239 --> 5638.599999999999
like from another

5636.159 --> 5643.28
country from other

5638.6 --> 5647.04
Banks you know what a United States

5643.28 --> 5650.48
government taking control can do you

5647.04 --> 5654.119
know what they can do can just say like

5650.48 --> 5657.799999999999
oh yeah yeah there's a whole bunch of

5654.119 --> 5658.96
credit card activity to that bank from

5657.8 --> 5662.719
another

5658.96 --> 5665.719
country we're just going to block that

5662.719 --> 5665.719
now

5665.8 --> 5672.88
like yeah just block the electronic

5669.719 --> 5676.159
traffic to that bank it's like yeah that

5672.88 --> 5678.159000000001
bank's basically been erased now like oh

5676.159 --> 5681.32
yeah that that only works outside of the

5678.159 --> 5686.48
United States now yeah yeah they can

5681.32 --> 5688.84
just do that yeah it's all about power

5686.48 --> 5692.04
it's not being done right now because

5688.84 --> 5696.6
the current communist Marxist government

5692.04 --> 5698.88
is literally in inviting them in wanting

5696.6 --> 5701.08
them to do that wanting them to

5698.88 --> 5703.36
literally roll over everything that's

5701.08 --> 5706.5599999999995
already in the United States that's why

5703.36 --> 5712.799999999999
it's happening there's a phoenix

5706.56 --> 5717.2390000000005
event then all of that all of it turns

5712.8 --> 5718.719
around it's what I'm saying a complete

5717.239 --> 5722.599999999999
flip

5718.719 --> 5722.6
around in every

5722.639 --> 5725.639
aspect

5742.719 --> 5746.44
yeah I think Jensen flat foot's getting

5745.119 --> 5749.48
a bit carried

5746.44 --> 5750.759999999999
away I mean it's all very unnerving I

5749.48 --> 5755.638999999999
get

5750.76 --> 5755.639
it it has been unnerving for a while

5756.75 --> 5760.84
[Music]

5758.0 --> 5764.92
but I mean it's not going to last very

5760.84 --> 5764.92
long Phoenix event will

5767.04 --> 5772.36
come unless theoretically it wouldn't

5770.239 --> 5776.04
and then the end for the United States

5772.36 --> 5780.44
going to be there very rapidly and then

5776.04 --> 5780.44
literally it will be like in South

5781.119 --> 5786.96
Africa then you'll get new news flashes

5784.28 --> 5791.719
how entire cities have just been purged

5786.96 --> 5794.04
from people yeah that's that's the other

5791.719 --> 5797.36
alternative but I'm pretty confident

5794.04 --> 5799.84
that a phoenix event will

5797.36 --> 5801.0
happen like why the hell else would

5799.84 --> 5804.84
there even

5801.0 --> 5809.0
be the N Eclipse why would they have

5804.84 --> 5809.0
built those towns in those places for

5812.52 --> 5815.52
that

5827.8 --> 5832.28
yeah migraines can act this ter sure

5829.84 --> 5833.96
they can right but that's that's what

5832.28 --> 5838.239
happens

5833.96 --> 5843.32
after right they go from straight out

5838.239 --> 5845.119
Invasion just like a public invasion but

5843.32 --> 5848.719
if that's all stopped well then they

5845.119 --> 5851.759999999999
still have stuff and then they can go to

5848.719 --> 5854.2390000000005
more subterfuge based Warfare which

5851.76 --> 5858.639
would be Terror attacks and power git

5854.239 --> 5861.718999999999
attacks and all yeah that could still

5858.639 --> 5864.92
happen there's going to be a lot

5861.719 --> 5867.28
of good willll if there is a phoenix

5864.92 --> 5870.28
event and the government

5867.28 --> 5873.08
changes into that new deep state that is

5870.28 --> 5875.5599999999995
going to be in direct opposition of

5873.08 --> 5879.04
everything that the old deep state has

5875.56 --> 5881.88
done there's going to be a dude you have

5879.04 --> 5884.04
any idea how many freaking volunteers

5881.88 --> 5886.88
how many veterans are going to come out

5884.04 --> 5889.119
of the Shadows like please please use me

5886.88 --> 5891.84
I'm reporting for Duty I want to save

5889.119 --> 5894.44
America send me after them sir send me

5891.84 --> 5897.599
after them dude there will be

5894.44 --> 5900.44
millions of people

5897.599 --> 5902.96
volunteering to take care of this

5900.44 --> 5905.5599999999995
situation if the Phoenix event happened

5902.96 --> 5908.84
Millions of people all this military

5905.56 --> 5912.2390000000005
people that have all been fired have

5908.84 --> 5914.360000000001
quit their military jobs and rank and

5912.239 --> 5916.239
everything because of this disgusting

5914.36 --> 5919.04
communist Marxist

5916.239 --> 5920.879999999999
crap and all the the forced medical

5919.04 --> 5923.36
experimentation that they had to be

5920.88 --> 5926.32
subjected to or be fired they will all

5923.36 --> 5928.598999999999
come out like please use me please this

5926.32 --> 5930.679
is why I even joined the military for

5928.599 --> 5936.159000000001
this kind of thing I want to save the

5930.679 --> 5936.159
country dude so so many

5936.4 --> 5940.0
people it's going to

5943.08 --> 5948.96
work if the Phoenix event actually

5946.04 --> 5951.44
happens and if not

5948.96 --> 5953.92
well then I don't see how there's any

5951.44 --> 5953.919999999999
hope at

5962.36 --> 5965.36
all

5972.84 --> 5977.52
right but I mean theoretically it it

5975.44 --> 5980.839999999999
could even be like if the Phoenix event

5977.52 --> 5984.360000000001
doesn't happen from the inside if the

5980.84 --> 5986.119000000001
the new deep State can't manage to do it

5984.36 --> 5988.88
then there's a good chance that it's

5986.119 --> 5992.32
going to sound bizarre that freaking

5988.88 --> 5995.32
Russia will do it for

5992.32 --> 5995.32
you

5997.96 --> 6004.4
because and despite what you all might

6001.0 --> 6007.239
think they can actually do that it's

6004.4 --> 6009.119
just not in their direct interest but

6007.239 --> 6011.0
it's also not in their direct interest

6009.119 --> 6014.239
to have their

6011.0 --> 6016.32
traditional partner International

6014.239 --> 6017.638999999999
partner the United States because that's

6016.32 --> 6022.32
what they

6017.639 --> 6025.32
are to have it completely irrevocably

6022.32 --> 6025.32
destroyed

6033.36 --> 6038.799999999999
Russia would much rather have the United

6035.599 --> 6040.92
States as a strategic partner you can't

6038.8 --> 6043.08
have a strategic partner if the entire

6040.92 --> 6046.4
country is just getting

6043.08 --> 6048.719
ravaged and turned to savagery and like

6046.4 --> 6051.5599999999995
total economic collapse to third world

6048.719 --> 6053.32
and worse status like then you don't

6051.56 --> 6057.320000000001
have a strategic partner anymore you

6053.32 --> 6059.44
only have a liability in it so if the

6057.32 --> 6061.799999999999
Phoenix event not going to come within

6059.44 --> 6064.598999999999
from within the new deep State then it

6061.8 --> 6064.599
might come from

6067.28 --> 6074.679
Russia

6069.92 --> 6074.679
although you got to just have faith

6075.239 --> 6082.239
that I mean that Americans can still do

6080.48 --> 6085.239
it

6082.239 --> 6085.239
right

6086.119 --> 6090.4
I mean that would be really [Â __Â ]

6088.0 --> 6094.04
embarrassing if another country had to

6090.4 --> 6096.679
like free huge country that supposedly

6094.04 --> 6100.04
ruled the world that they another

6096.679 --> 6102.08
country had to free them from their

6100.04 --> 6104.5199999999995
oppressors that would be really

6102.08 --> 6106.28
embarrassing that would be historically

6104.52 --> 6108.52
incredibly

6106.28 --> 6113.239
humiliating Russia didn't have to do

6108.52 --> 6115.96
that either Russia freed themselves from

6113.239 --> 6115.959999999999
from their

6119.8 --> 6125.28
Communists

6121.36 --> 6126.69
so it would be better if the United

6125.28 --> 6130.04
States did the

6126.69 --> 6130.04
[Music]

6130.28 --> 6134.639
same anyway I'm going to take a bite of

6132.48 --> 6137.638999999999
my Illuminati CU I am

6134.639 --> 6137.639
hungry

6142.159 --> 6145.159
cheers

6147.95 --> 6158.889999999999
[Music]

6162.77 --> 6168.070000000001
[Music]

6182.15 --> 6195.1089999999995
[Music]

6200.96 --> 6205.119
h h

6220.76 --> 6223.04
right

6223.44 --> 6229.36
so hope all of you are still with

6227.599 --> 6232.04
me I

6229.36 --> 6236.598999999999
mean this entire

6232.04 --> 6239.96
subject of the Phoenix event is very

6236.599 --> 6239.96
unnerving I get

6242.52 --> 6248.92
it and there has been so much terrible

6246.119 --> 6251.04
buildup to it I totally get that you're

6248.92 --> 6254.76
like panicking or flipping out or

6251.04 --> 6258.04
whatever over it it has been totally

6254.76 --> 6258.04
insane thus

6261.32 --> 6264.04
far hey would working good anywhere good

6263.599 --> 6267.360000000001
to see

6264.04 --> 6270.8
[Music]

6267.36 --> 6273.239
you what's the Phoenix event it's an

6270.8 --> 6276.4800000000005
event that I predict will happen very

6273.239 --> 6276.48
quick very

6276.52 --> 6282.56
shortly and it's a thing that will

6279.48 --> 6285.0
happen out of the N Eclipse which is

6282.56 --> 6285.0
about to

6286.28 --> 6290.4
happen like next week or

6292.04 --> 6295.04
something

6298.719 --> 6305.52
my prediction is

6301.679 --> 6307.0
that a new deep state which is already

6305.52 --> 6308.52
people that are already there people

6307.0 --> 6312.04
already are familiar with them they're

6308.52 --> 6314.679
already fighting the old deep State

6312.04 --> 6317.96
politically that they

6314.679 --> 6317.96
will take

6321.96 --> 6329.719
over that they will take over of the

6326.76 --> 6332.56
collapsing Marxist communist government

6329.719 --> 6334.8
in the United States and replace them

6332.56 --> 6334.8
very

6351.92 --> 6356.96
quickly

6354.32 --> 6359.48
chop wood carry water right yeah you

6356.96 --> 6359.4800000000005
just carry

6361.76 --> 6367.76
on it's just I'm making this prediction

6365.28 --> 6367.759999999999
I feel

6368.159 --> 6373.92
it Mina eclipses are very

6371.52 --> 6375.679
significant significant enough that the

6373.92 --> 6378.52
founders of the

6375.679 --> 6383.0
country named these

6378.52 --> 6384.320000000001
places n in anticipation of this very

6383.0 --> 6387.44
very

6384.32 --> 6391.159
specific solar eclipse

6387.44 --> 6394.839999999999
event there is no other

6391.159 --> 6394.839999999999
way they must have

6397.719 --> 6406.2390000000005
known and deemed it significant enough

6402.96 --> 6406.2390000000005
to rename these towns

6410.56 --> 6414.84
near yeah it's time to f

6431.04 --> 6434.04
go

6441.84 --> 6444.84
h

6470.679 --> 6473.4
right wooden work and guny bear but I

6472.119 --> 6476.759999999999
mean

6473.4 --> 6479.28
the eclipse itself it's just a solar

6476.76 --> 6482.719
eclipse

6479.28 --> 6484.28
but accompanied with that

6482.719 --> 6486.719
are

6484.28 --> 6488.679
energies building up to that and I've

6486.719 --> 6492.119
been feeling it for quite a

6488.679 --> 6495.36
while there's a very strong buildup of

6492.119 --> 6498.239
energy that is more than just the

6495.36 --> 6501.759999999999
springtime

6498.239 --> 6504.759999999999
energy and I'm like drowning in it

6501.76 --> 6504.76
recently

6518.4 --> 6520.92
modern

6522.56 --> 6527.639
Comforts a rebirth yeah that's why I'm

6525.04 --> 6531.199
saying a phoenix

6527.639 --> 6533.88
event and Phoenix is a

6531.199 --> 6538.119
rebirth it's just a very specific type

6533.88 --> 6542.4400000000005
of rebirth it's a rebirth from

6538.119 --> 6542.44
Flames from chaos from

6561.719 --> 6564.719
destruction

6586.28 --> 6590.92
what how the hell oh

6588.8 --> 6592.719
sorry yeah don't worry about that

6590.92 --> 6595.599
Woodwork and guny bear there's no animal

6592.719 --> 6598.04
is going to drop dead There's No Angel

6595.599 --> 6600.0
of Death suddenly coming by or anything

6598.04 --> 6602.119
it's nothing like

6600.0 --> 6605.599
that but it's a bit weird that you're

6602.119 --> 6606.88
feeling tired and lazy lately that's not

6605.599 --> 6609.88
good you

6606.88 --> 6609.88
should

6611.52 --> 6620.280000000001
really like find a moment of silence and

6614.28 --> 6620.28
try to breathe it in like reinvigorate

6621.639 --> 6624.639
yourself

6628.8 --> 6631.52
tap into the

6639.48 --> 6646.879999999999
energy right or or

6643.36 --> 6646.88
maybe it is

6646.96 --> 6654.32
the quiet before the storm maybe it is

6651.639 --> 6658.079
you tiring a

6654.32 --> 6660.4
bit before you wake up again that could

6658.079 --> 6660.4
be it

6663.36 --> 6668.839999999999
too think it's got to do with all the

6666.239 --> 6671.04
upcoming flurry of work right that could

6668.84 --> 6674.079
be

6671.04 --> 6676.079
yeah yeah that that makes sense AC quiet

6674.079 --> 6678.799999999999
before the storm and you just your

6676.079 --> 6681.84
bodies already like knowing oh it's

6678.8 --> 6685.92
coming let's take it easy before we know

6681.84 --> 6685.92
have no longer have any time to take it

6686.88 --> 6694.400000000001
easy right in that case if if that is

6690.679 --> 6698.4
what it is then I'd actually advise you

6694.4 --> 6701.799999999999
to like cut down on things like drinking

6698.4 --> 6705.4
coffee and all that do less of

6701.8 --> 6708.360000000001
it like use the quiet before the storm

6705.4 --> 6708.36
to purify

6709.56 --> 6715.84
yourself that's like the best thing you

6711.599 --> 6715.84
can do with that with that kind of

6718.52 --> 6724.159000000001
Moment Like cut down on the sugar cut

6721.76 --> 6727.599
down on the coffee definitely cut down

6724.159 --> 6730.48
or completely cut out alcohol entirely

6727.599 --> 6733.28
cut down on the smoking all of that and

6730.48 --> 6736.079
just like purify yourself maybe do some

6733.28 --> 6738.48
fasting excellent idea actually fasting

6736.079 --> 6740.199
I've already been recommending fasting

6738.48 --> 6741.839999999999
this is the time for fasting for a lot

6740.199 --> 6744.44
of people people are going to go nuts

6741.84 --> 6748.1990000000005
people are going to go sick fasting is a

6744.44 --> 6751.04
really good solution for that in this

6748.199 --> 6754.5199999999995
specific time frame including in

6751.04 --> 6754.5199999999995
anticipation of the nin

6755.36 --> 6763.0
Eclipse nine baby goats damn baby horse

6760.079 --> 6763.0
oh that's

6763.36 --> 6768.5599999999995
awesome

6765.199 --> 6770.36
damn well that's a that's great

6768.56 --> 6774.4400000000005
congratulations I

6770.36 --> 6774.44
guess it's a lot of goats

6781.079 --> 6785.679
baby horse is awesome horses are

6796.52 --> 6803.4400000000005
awesome baby goats are cute yeah

6800.04 --> 6805.199
definitely right so that those are some

6803.44 --> 6808.0199999999995
of my tips of what you could

6805.199 --> 6810.159
do in this time

6808.02 --> 6814.4400000000005
[Music]

6810.159 --> 6817.36
period fasting cutting down

6814.44 --> 6821.44
on drug consumption of All

6817.36 --> 6825.159
Sorts including sugar especially

6821.44 --> 6827.32
sugar right because within the spring

6825.159 --> 6828.92
time frame it is like this is the

6827.32 --> 6832.719
bacterial Bloom

6828.92 --> 6834.8
time the bacteria are waking up because

6832.719 --> 6836.639
of Springtime that's why a lot of people

6834.8 --> 6839.119000000001
are suddenly getting

6836.639 --> 6841.719
sick cutting down on sugar is going to

6839.119 --> 6841.719
be really

6841.8 --> 6846.88
helpful and all the other stuff and

6844.639 --> 6849.96
sugar cutting down on it well that

6846.88 --> 6853.400000000001
definitely means alcohol

6849.96 --> 6857.2390000000005
like unless you're like a straight out

6853.4 --> 6859.799999999999
alcoholic even if you if you aren't like

6857.239 --> 6863.28
that then I definitely recommend like

6859.8 --> 6868.400000000001
don't drink anything for for a

6863.28 --> 6870.639
while anything not a drop like avoid it

6868.4 --> 6872.079
it's going to have more negative impact

6870.639 --> 6876.119
on

6872.079 --> 6879.0
you in this time frame so completely

6876.119 --> 6881.96
don't do that be careful with the

6879.0 --> 6884.239
sugar and that's already like a great

6881.96 --> 6887.639
maneuver great for your health great for

6884.239 --> 6887.638999999999
your development and mental

6887.76 --> 6893.4800000000005
health and then on top of that if you

6890.36 --> 6896.839999999999
want to take it further like do do fast

6893.48 --> 6898.239
in it's good for this specific time

6896.84 --> 6901.88
frame for this

6898.239 --> 6904.759999999999
period and the N eclipse and the

6901.88 --> 6907.679
potential Phoenix event only add to that

6904.76 --> 6910.079000000001
only they're an amplifier a strong

6907.679 --> 6911.04
amplifier which makes all these actions

6910.079 --> 6915.759999999999
more

6911.04 --> 6915.76
important and more fruitful in the

6920.159 --> 6927.5599999999995
result God off prescription and wow well

6923.52 --> 6927.56
that is very tough Jensen

6932.44 --> 6935.638999999999
flatfoot that

6935.84 --> 6938.84
is

6940.639 --> 6945.4800000000005
yeah now the trick is to never get on

6943.48 --> 6949.4
them ever

6945.48 --> 6953.879999999999
again and see what you can still

6949.4 --> 6956.239
manage cuz anti- depressed

6953.88 --> 6958.4800000000005
are

6956.239 --> 6960.799999999999
dangerous they change

6958.48 --> 6964.119
you and often they change you

6960.8 --> 6967.719
irrevocably so I I can't even give like

6964.119 --> 6967.719
fullblown advice about

6971.96 --> 6979.2390000000005
it don't drink that's good do smoke a

6976.079 --> 6980.96
lot well I'm not telling you to stop

6979.239 --> 6982.759999999999
smoking

6980.96 --> 6987.04
just just

6982.76 --> 6990.56
do less of it and then try to get more

6987.04 --> 6992.8
joy out of the time that you are smoking

6990.56 --> 6996.719
just be careful with

6992.8 --> 6996.719
it like I'm doing that

6997.88 --> 7002.76
too also if you're going to smoke I

7000.88 --> 7005.76
really advise you

7002.76 --> 7008.280000000001
to I would generally advise you but if

7005.76 --> 7013.0
if there's a good time for it ever then

7008.28 --> 7015.92
get carbon filters for your smokes

7013.0 --> 7015.92
even if it's just

7017.119 --> 7025.598999999999
tobacco it'll spare your lungs in it a a

7020.96 --> 7027.96
good way it'll be better for you right

7025.599 --> 7029.360000000001
see it as like a an in between type of

7027.96 --> 7034.0
fasting for

7029.36 --> 7034.0
smoking it's a good time to start using

7041.159 --> 7044.159
those

7044.239 --> 7048.598999999999
never get Ever Getting Fooled Again

7046.56 --> 7051.719
great Jensen flatfoot I'm really glad

7048.599 --> 7051.719
you've gotten to that

7053.159 --> 7057.5199999999995
realization we can't pull through those

7055.88 --> 7059.84
things what I don't know what you're

7057.52 --> 7059.84
talking

7070.44 --> 7074.5599999999995
about what are you talking

7100.48 --> 7105.638999999999
about told you he had a what are you

7104.0 --> 7107.84
talking about what are you talking about

7105.639 --> 7112.92
heart

7107.84 --> 7112.92
attack what I've never had a heart

7113.52 --> 7118.1990000000005
attack it's just that's for my it's

7116.4 --> 7122.239
called a health

7118.199 --> 7122.239
investment investment in my

7122.639 --> 7130.400000000001
health yeah octy tube carbon filters

7127.4 --> 7132.5599999999995
I've been using this for like almost a

7130.4 --> 7135.04
decade and they're

7132.56 --> 7138.079000000001
absolutely

7135.04 --> 7140.56
fantastic like I never ever want to

7138.079 --> 7142.0
smoke anything ever again without using

7140.56 --> 7146.320000000001
these

7142.0 --> 7149.0
ever not even going to touch a regular

7146.32 --> 7151.28
cigarette this is the real stuff this is

7149.0 --> 7151.28
what you

7153.44 --> 7159.28
want about who shut the [Â __Â ] up about

7156.88 --> 7159.28
[Â __Â ]

7161.04 --> 7165.88
Craig

7162.599 --> 7165.88
banned [Â __Â ]

7191.04 --> 7194.04
off

7220.96 --> 7223.96
m

7227.719 --> 7234.119
you guys are

7230.44 --> 7234.119
exchanging milking

7238.239 --> 7242.83
information I have very little insight

7240.56 --> 7245.899
on

7242.83 --> 7245.899
[Music]

7250.92 --> 7253.92
that

7256.96 --> 7260.0
level with me good to see

7280.92 --> 7283.92
you

7310.84 --> 7313.84
for

7318.04 --> 7324.159
why do you think they picked the 2024

7320.239 --> 7324.159
Eclipse when they picked the naming the

7327.679 --> 7332.159
towns

7329.28 --> 7334.639
yeah probably

7332.159 --> 7338.199
because it's part of a

7334.639 --> 7339.28
cycle as I said I mean it's all about

7338.199 --> 7341.719
all of the

7339.28 --> 7344.44
celestials all that that happens with it

7341.719 --> 7346.079
is astrology it's all about cycles and

7344.44 --> 7351.44
they probably

7346.079 --> 7353.92
predicted a cycle and they wanted to

7351.44 --> 7357.96
signify it and

7353.92 --> 7362.639
emphasize basically give a spell along

7357.96 --> 7364.4800000000005
that specific moment of the cycle by by

7362.639 --> 7367.079
emphasizing

7364.48 --> 7369.879999999999
nin so they had

7367.079 --> 7373.92
envisioned a phoenix event based on the

7369.88 --> 7376.4800000000005
celestial predicted things to

7373.92 --> 7378.84
come that's what I'm saying I'm saying

7376.48 --> 7383.0
that I think the founding fathers

7378.84 --> 7385.88
predicted a phoenix event for this

7383.0 --> 7385.88
Celestial

7390.88 --> 7394.400000000001
occurrence that's what I

7399.84 --> 7404.92
believe and why this one why that one

7403.119 --> 7407.48
well that always have to do with with

7404.92 --> 7410.0
the Cycles the time Cycles that's always

7407.48 --> 7412.678999999999
the reason how all those astrolog

7410.0 --> 7417.199
astrology related things

7412.679 --> 7417.1990000000005
are are done all has to do with

7417.96 --> 7422.8
Cycles aren't these solici just holog

7420.679 --> 7426.079
how the [Â __Â ] does that relate to

7422.8 --> 7429.28
anything L alot what the hell does that

7426.079 --> 7429.28
have to do with

7430.719 --> 7433.719
anything

7438.69 --> 7441.919999999999
[Music]

7447.28 --> 7452.719
are you guys trying to mock me cuz I'll

7449.8 --> 7455.76
kick you the [Â __Â ] out of here yeah this

7452.719 --> 7456.599
is very serious it's not your time to

7455.76 --> 7459.320000000001
start

7456.599 --> 7463.4800000000005
mocking by

7459.32 --> 7468.4
relating my conceptions of the nature of

7463.48 --> 7472.48
reality to astrological events that were

7468.4 --> 7472.48
predicted hundreds of years ago

7483.45 --> 7486.8
[Music]

7490.639 --> 7493.639
yeah

7499.88 --> 7506.52
yeah well Holograms doesn't mean they're

7503.04 --> 7507.32
fake it just means they're not physical

7506.52 --> 7510.639
in

7507.32 --> 7510.639
nature that is

7512.159 --> 7518.0
all and they're definitely

7515.76 --> 7522.4400000000005
persistent that's why people call it the

7518.0 --> 7525.0
sky clock as astrology uses them and

7522.44 --> 7527.04
persistence and their predictability in

7525.0 --> 7530.92
their

7527.04 --> 7532.8
Cycles yeah and the N Eclipse was one of

7530.92 --> 7535.2390000000005
these predicted

7532.8 --> 7539.559
events in that the founding fathers

7535.239 --> 7541.558999999999
would have foreseen enough to rename all

7539.559 --> 7545.719
these

7541.559 --> 7548.84
towns to give it a spell to

7545.719 --> 7553.639
emphasize something more specific and

7548.84 --> 7553.639
place it into the future

7556.4 --> 7559.079
what if nothing

7562.0 --> 7565.199
happens it

7565.36 --> 7569.28
will there's already [Â __Â ]

7571.48 --> 7576.079
happening bro you can just sit there

7573.76 --> 7578.04
close your eyes put your fingers in your

7576.079 --> 7580.48
ear and say la la la la la there's still

7578.04 --> 7583.119
something going to happen the energy is

7580.48 --> 7587.04
already there

7583.119 --> 7587.04
the timing of things where we're

7587.32 --> 7593.799999999999
at at some

7589.679 --> 7593.8
point nothing can

7594.199 --> 7600.839999999999
happen and it's been going towards that

7598.119 --> 7600.839999999999
for a while

7604.44 --> 7610.199
now

7606.559 --> 7610.1990000000005
yeah entropy

7610.52 --> 7615.84
dictates

7613.36 --> 7619.719
nothing can't

7615.84 --> 7619.719
happen something will

7629.78 --> 7636.159
[Music]

7632.599 --> 7638.32
happen nothing related to the eclipse

7636.159 --> 7641.199
care to make a bet

7638.32 --> 7643.719
no care to donate to my PayPal or shut

7641.199 --> 7643.719
the [Â __Â ] [Â __Â ]

7652.0 --> 7656.28
up yeah you're out of

7664.48 --> 7670.598999999999
here and so are you

7667.679 --> 7673.4800000000005
bye-bye you can stop spamming my channel

7670.599 --> 7676.639
now with your horse [Â __Â ] get the [Â __Â ]

7673.48 --> 7676.638999999999
out and don't come

7687.48 --> 7692.598999999999
back all things can happen how will you

7690.199 --> 7694.879999999999
know which one is the Phoenix event

7692.599 --> 7697.079
because I specifically described what

7694.88 --> 7699.719
the [Â __Â ] it would be none of you seem to

7697.079 --> 7701.759999999999
be listening all this shit's pouring out

7699.719 --> 7704.639
of your ears all of a sudden your

7701.76 --> 7706.4400000000005
[Â __Â ] bets you goddamn ass wipes who

7704.639 --> 7708.1990000000005
the [Â __Â ] you think you are I've been

7706.44 --> 7711.159
describing

7708.199 --> 7716.159
literally literally what the Phoenix

7711.159 --> 7719.32
event would be I don't take [Â __Â ] bets

7716.159 --> 7721.598999999999
[Â __Â ] you don't like it well [Â __Â ] off

7719.32 --> 7726.5199999999995
then go make your [Â __Â ] videos about

7721.599 --> 7726.52
how Arwin is wrong who gives a

7729.96 --> 7735.88
[Â __Â ] I predict there's a phoenix event

7733.0 --> 7739.199
it's already underway the energies are

7735.88 --> 7741.719
there n eclipse is going to happen it

7739.199 --> 7745.5199999999995
was predicted by the founding fathers

7741.719 --> 7748.0
hundreds of years ago and significant

7745.52 --> 7753.719
enough for them to literally rename

7748.0 --> 7756.079
towns in its Pathway to Neve yeah it's

7753.719 --> 7758.92
all you need to

7756.079 --> 7761.558999999999
know been very specific about how the

7758.92 --> 7763.92
Phoenix event will occur yeah the new

7761.559 --> 7766.4400000000005
state will take over the old deep State

7763.92 --> 7769.0
I mean how much more [Â __Â ] specific do

7766.44 --> 7769.0
I need to

7770.0 --> 7774.04
be when did they rename the

7774.679 --> 7780.84
towns how the [Â __Â ] should I know they're

7777.8 --> 7780.84
just named

7781.76 --> 7787.559
that rename name it they named the

7788.119 --> 7793.32
towns maybe they told people like hey

7791.119 --> 7795.04
you go there you go build a town and

7793.32 --> 7797.48
it's going to be called Neve how the

7795.04 --> 7799.76
[Â __Â ] should I know exactly the details

7797.48 --> 7799.759999999999
of

7801.67 --> 7805.59
[Music]

7812.3 --> 7817.92
[Music]

7814.559 --> 7820.360000000001
that got any more stupid detail

7817.92 --> 7823.32
questions you don't seem to understand

7928.639 --> 7933.599
yeah and I do make predictions and

7931.079 --> 7939.159
that's it I make the

7933.599 --> 7941.4400000000005
prediction now deal with it yeah no more

7939.159 --> 7944.28
inquiry you're going to have to [Â __Â ]

7941.44 --> 7944.28

obligations you see it's all on a

8127.36 --> 8134.28
voluntary

8129.559 --> 8136.400000000001
basis yeah I answer questions because I

8134.28 --> 8139.4
choose to answer

8136.4 --> 8142.5199999999995
questions when I choose not to answer

8139.4 --> 8144.28
the question then there's literally

8142.52 --> 8148.8
nothing you

8144.28 --> 8148.8
have to make me answer the

8149.92 --> 8158.679
question I have full control over

8154.239 --> 8158.678999999999
whether I respond or not and

8163.84 --> 8170.639
how and I've done what I've done i' made

8167.239 --> 8175.119
a prediction Phoenix event prediction

8170.639 --> 8175.119

get you don't like it it's not my

yeah yeah you don't get to project your

8208.92 --> 8212.84
hor [Â __Â ] on me

8217.359 --> 8222.2

8220.12 --> 8224.800000000001

[Music]

8299.76 --> 8302.76
for

8305.479 --> 8312.319
I looked at a map of the total

8308.76 --> 8317.12
totality right TR it I have seen videos

8312.319 --> 8317.119999999999
that show the map yes Steven

8324.439 --> 8332.599
Jarvis it's going like straight across

8328.16 --> 8337.2
it or not straight d

8332.599 --> 8337.2
diagonally from the southwest to the

8359.719 --> 8362.719
Northeast

8373.799 --> 8377.009

h

8431.12 --> 8434.12
Northeast

8438.56 --> 8446.359
what no what are you talking

8442.12 --> 8446.359
about it's not Northeast to

8448.399 --> 8452.64
Southwest is it

8454.76 --> 8461.319
wait now I'm confused I thought it

8458.359 --> 8464.319
was Southwest to

8461.319 --> 8464.319
Northeast

8468.73 --> 8475.92
[Music]

8479.56 --> 8482.56

h

8519.03 --> 8525.77
[Music]

8535.76 --> 8542.52
I want to see the

8538.08 --> 8542.52
map where's the map one

8545.56 --> 8552.279999999999
oh damn it you're

8548.88 --> 8555.279999999999
right it is the Northwest to the

8552.28 --> 8555.28
southeast

8566.2 --> 8572.439
ah I've got that wrong as well oh you

8569.479 --> 8576.438999999998
want to give me lip about

8572.439 --> 8576.439
that it's just a simple

8586.64 --> 8593.08
mixup I think I probably saw a video

8590.68 --> 8594.64
where multiple eclipses over the United

8593.08 --> 8596.88
States were

8594.64 --> 8599.278999999999
compared and I just switched it around

8596.88 --> 8599.278999999999
in my

8599.439 --> 8602.439
mind

8606.76 --> 8612.359
but you're right it was Northeast to

8609.359 --> 8612.359
Southwest

8629.16 --> 8635.52
indeed the curved line why don't you

8631.84 --> 8638.6
understand the curved line yeah yeah

8635.52 --> 8641.399000000001
that is a bit weird isn't

8638.6 --> 8645.479000000001
it those curved lines from the eclipse

8641.399 --> 8648.64
shadow that probably has to do with well

8645.479 --> 8648.64
the way the map is

8653.439 --> 8657.960000000001
constructed right those pathways

8656.12 --> 8661.68
are

8657.96 --> 8666.319
probably distorted because because of

8661.68 --> 8666.319
the glob fication of the map

8671.59 --> 8675.809
[Music]

8683.88 --> 8690.599999999999
layout cuz technically I don't see any

8687.16 --> 8694.039999999999
reason why any Eclipse Shadow wouldn't

8690.6 --> 8696.6
always just be a straight line from

8694.04 --> 8696.6
beginning to

8711.04 --> 8715.68
end that's kind of funny too because

8714.24 --> 8718.439
like on

8715.68 --> 8721.359
land the Shadows do go like in the

8718.439 --> 8723.52
straight line and then

8721.359 --> 8727.399000000001
at the ocean is where it supposedly then

8723.52 --> 8727.399000000001
starts curving which is highly

8730.84 --> 8734.279
suspicious am I

8742.22 --> 8745.39
[Music]

8749.24 --> 8752.24
right

8807.0 --> 8813.72
what really woodworking G bear

8811.2 --> 8813.720000000001
okie

8818.92 --> 8825.16
dokie that's pretty

8821.2 --> 8827.2
freaky if that would be the case like

8825.16 --> 8831.68
okay okay

8827.2 --> 8831.68
God my place is significant

8831.72 --> 8836.08
somehow but I mean who knows what will

8834.08 --> 8838.96
happen

8836.08 --> 8841.359
exactly but considering there's so much

8838.96 --> 8843.759999999998
energy already being

8841.359 --> 8848.720000000001
releast

8843.76 --> 8851.08
in anticipation or in the upcomings of

8848.72 --> 8854.08
this Eclipse

8851.08 --> 8854.08
event

8856.359 --> 8861.56
well you know like what is that could it

8860.08 --> 8865.68
be that

8861.56 --> 8867.96
perhaps a spiritual Gateway a portal is

8865.68 --> 8872.12
open

8867.96 --> 8872.119999999999
somehow maybe there will be

8872.2 --> 8877.800000000001
yeah this is going to get like really

8874.8 --> 8881.24
vague in ways but maybe it is actually

8877.8 --> 8883.199999999999
the Phoenix event will be a portal that

8881.24 --> 8885.56
opens where a whole bunch of spirits

8883.2 --> 8888.439
maybe old Spirits

8885.56 --> 8889.439
maybe Spirits from the time of the

8888.439 --> 8893.12
founding

8889.439 --> 8895.6
fathers will literally come down and

8893.12 --> 8895.6
possess

8898.08 --> 8905.72
people and that that that is what

8901.88 --> 8908.399
causes the uprise of the old deep State

8905.72 --> 8911.56
and a and the eventual effective Phenix

8908.399 --> 8913.439
event like that could potentially

8911.56 --> 8916.92
explain it like if there's all this

8913.439 --> 8918.92
energy being released in anticipation

8916.92 --> 8923.439
well then

8918.92 --> 8927.84
maybe entities Angels arguably

8923.439 --> 8931.439
or locked in spiritual Time

8927.84 --> 8934.399
Travelers of the dead of that

8931.439 --> 8939.92
time might be coming

8934.399 --> 8942.68
through to repossess as it were very fun

8939.92 --> 8945.24
funny like the choice of word in there

8942.68 --> 8947.84
repossess the United

8945.24 --> 8949.96
States to its original

8947.84 --> 8952.6
Spirit

8949.96 --> 8955.8
yeah when you think of it like that well

8952.6 --> 8959.04
that certainly does like quite literally

8955.8 --> 8961.16
sound like a phoenix event wouldn't

8959.04 --> 8963.2
it

8961.16 --> 8965.6
in a spiritual sense and that might lead

8963.2 --> 8969.479000000001
to a

8965.6 --> 8973.479000000001
yeah a revolution a deep State

8969.479 --> 8975.76
Revolution so yeah I mean to me it just

8973.479 --> 8975.76
makes

8984.04 --> 8989.04
sense JD dreamers yeah he's still out

8987.04 --> 8992.04
there isn't

8989.04 --> 8992.04
he

8993.6 --> 8997.640000000001
I wish he would like contact me more and

8995.52 --> 9000.359
all that I love to like continue talking

8997.64 --> 9003.96
to him but he's like doing

9000.359 --> 9006.24
his pay-per-view type Channel thing

9003.96 --> 9006.24
isn't

9006.84 --> 9014.6
he too bad I'm just throwing it out for

9010.56 --> 9015.8
free and I get a lot of trolls to as a

9014.6 --> 9017.720000000001
thanks for

9015.8 --> 9020.64
that I

9017.72 --> 9023.0
mean I'm not doing what I do to make

9020.64 --> 9024.519999999999
money I'm doing it because I feel like I

9023.0 --> 9028.68
need to share it with the world and I

9024.52 --> 9028.68
want to I just want to show

9029.16 --> 9039.039999999999
you there's plenty of people that don't

9033.52 --> 9043.12
have money to pay for what they

9039.04 --> 9045.800000000001
like like I have so I've lived a lot of

9043.12 --> 9048.12
my life not like getting a lot of things

9045.8 --> 9048.119999999999
for

9048.479 --> 9055.278999999999
free and I understand what that's

9051.84 --> 9058.0
like and thus I give back for free and

9055.279 --> 9059.560000000001
I've lived like that in principle like

9058.0 --> 9061.96
that's with even with my trolls and

9059.56 --> 9065.439
Tyrant project something that I worked

9061.96 --> 9070.039999999999
like over 10,000 hours

9065.439 --> 9073.76
on and I'm giving it for free literally

9070.04 --> 9077.880000000001
like yeah 10,000 hours giving it for

9073.76 --> 9081.92
free and it's been great because when

9077.88 --> 9084.759999999998
you do that when you don't make it about

9081.92 --> 9087.2
like Earthly green squares everything

9084.76 --> 9091.72
that you do

9087.2 --> 9092.720000000001
then the value of what you do has a yeah

9091.72 --> 9096.679999999998
has

9092.72 --> 9099.0
a a more lasting quality to

9096.68 --> 9102.08
it and more

9099.0 --> 9104.439
influence more influence in a in a

9102.08 --> 9107.6
spiritual broader way that's kind of

9104.439 --> 9110.6
like hard to get to grasp really so

9107.6 --> 9113.439
that's how I choose to live

9110.6 --> 9117.84
I don't want to be rich I just want to

9113.439 --> 9117.84
be able to do what I do and have an

9118.359 --> 9121.960000000001
influence have my

9123.279 --> 9129.960000000001
influence to those that seek

9128.2 --> 9131.960000000001
it that is

9129.96 --> 9135.08
[Music]

9131.96 --> 9138.56
it it's a free Channel

9135.08 --> 9138.56

9143.319 --> 9148.399
YouTube or is it did he make a new

9145.96 --> 9148.399
YouTube

for

9200.55 --> 9208.42
[Music]

9215.21 --> 9218.38

9233.84 --> 9237.76
wait is this a new

9240.92 --> 9245.72
one 2000

9243.8 --> 9251.358999999999
what that is

9245.72 --> 9251.358999999999
weird I wasn't subscribed that's weird

9253.399 --> 9257.8
man okay well I'm subscribed to him now

9255.76 --> 9261.04
I don't know how that how I was

9257.8 --> 9263.96
unsubscribed to that that's really

9261.04 --> 9267.479000000001
strange thanks for reminding me about

9263.96 --> 9272.24
him like one of my first shows around

9267.479 --> 9272.24
the Flat Earth talks days was with JD

9272.96 --> 9278.839999999998
remers it's a website with the page stud

9275.76 --> 9278.84
right right right

9288.64 --> 9291.64
exactly

9292.88 --> 9297.0
yeah I got it would work on bear I

9294.52 --> 9297.0

right been go going for 2 and a half

9350.64 --> 9353.56
hours already I hope you've all been

9352.479 --> 9358.8
enjoying

9353.56 --> 9360.359
it despite the uh the trolling incursion

9358.8 --> 9362.84
which is very

9360.359 --> 9365.16
annoying of course people will say oh

9362.84 --> 9367.16
it's just people asking questions no

9365.16 --> 9369.399
it's people being really [Â __Â ]

9367.16 --> 9372.8
annoying treating me like I'm some kind

9369.399 --> 9374.64
of chat GPT bot I'm

9372.8 --> 9377.72
not

9374.64 --> 9380.24
yeah just because you think there's all

9377.72 --> 9383.72
these detail

9380.24 --> 9386.199999999999
information out there well guess what

9383.72 --> 9390.84
there isn't not for me

9386.2 --> 9393.52
anyway yeah I'm just going on an

9390.84 --> 9394.68
intuition it's a spiritual stuff you

9393.52 --> 9397.720000000001
could call

9394.68 --> 9401.0
it part of being an

9397.72 --> 9402.88
oracle seeing patterns and calling them

9401.0 --> 9406.279
ahead of

9402.88 --> 9408.839999999998
time or you can call that ridiculous and

9406.279 --> 9411.52
then like try to mock me over it

9408.84 --> 9411.52
whatever

9414.16 --> 9420.119999999999
but yeah I'm not going to have you spam

9416.84 --> 9420.12
my chat for with your

9420.279 --> 9426.399000000001
nonsense literally if there's like two

9422.68 --> 9429.439
pages of chat of just people being whiny

9426.399 --> 9432.399
and complaining about it you will end up

9429.439 --> 9433.319
getting banned you should realize that

9432.399 --> 9435.88
by

9433.319 --> 9438.199999999999
now that I don't accept that kind of

9435.88 --> 9438.199999999999
chat

9438.359 --> 9444.439
Behavior like especially when your

9441.6 --> 9448.800000000001
activity is literally causing other

9444.439 --> 9451.6
people to not speak up in my chat

9448.8 --> 9455.0
anymore they don't speak up because

9451.6 --> 9455.0
you're in the

9455.68 --> 9459.68
way with Annoying

9460.2 --> 9466.880000000001
attitude right and then I have to remove

9463.68 --> 9468.439
you so that there's room for the people

9466.88 --> 9473.319
that I

9468.439 --> 9473.319
like they don't pester me with

9475.2 --> 9478.92
things that I'm not here

9481.92 --> 9486.479
for right

9483.88 --> 9488.8
anyway everybody don't forget to rogans

9486.479 --> 9488.8
up the

9490.359 --> 9496.359
show if you haven't

9493.479 --> 9498.438999999998
already oh looks like a lot of people

9496.359 --> 9501.439
have nine that's

9498.439 --> 9501.439
cool

9503.24 --> 9508.0
right talked a lot about the whole

9505.439 --> 9508.0
Phoenix

9513.479 --> 9522.399
event I kind of want to put it in the

9517.56 --> 9522.399
title but the it's not going to really

9528.439 --> 9534.009
fit

9529.78 --> 9534.009
[Music]

9536.88 --> 9540.479
no it's not going to

9538.76 --> 9543.56
fit damn

9540.479 --> 9546.599999999999
it I guess I'll have to

9543.56 --> 9549.278999999999
like put it in another title for

9546.6 --> 9549.279
tomorrow or

9549.479 --> 9554.08
something I probably will do that I will

9552.08 --> 9556.399
just put it in the title I I don't think

9554.08 --> 9561.88
I've had a title yet where I

9556.399 --> 9561.88
literally used the words Phoenix

9563.64 --> 9569.24
event and by the way just for the

9566.56 --> 9572.8
record the entire Phoenix event is

9569.24 --> 9575.92
really relevant to me and my

9572.8 --> 9577.759999999998
channel cuz you might have noticed that

9575.92 --> 9580.960000000001
the actual

9577.76 --> 9584.12
symbol of the Flat Earth early bird show

9580.96 --> 9587.759999999998
huh you look very

9584.12 --> 9587.76
carefully that's a

9588.319 --> 9591.319
phoenix

9601.0 --> 9608.84
yeah and Arwin means friend of the

9605.92 --> 9612.52
eagle but that is

9608.84 --> 9615.6
arguably the ego is a very

9612.52 --> 9618.319000000001
close symbol to the

9615.6 --> 9620.359
Phoenix that's

9618.319 --> 9623.08
why

9620.359 --> 9626.6
there was a phoenix in the symbol

9623.08 --> 9626.6
because that's the closest to an

9626.96 --> 9632.72
eagle so it's very relevant to

9636.12 --> 9643.08
me post phix event chat chat

9640.399 --> 9645.92
no but hey the Phoenix event's not there

9643.08 --> 9647.2
yet right we still got some time a

9645.92 --> 9650.08
little over a

9647.2 --> 9652.560000000001
week and the energy build is already

9650.08 --> 9655.88
there the full moon is also there by the

9652.56 --> 9659.199999999999
way right now so it's like for me it's

9655.88 --> 9661.278999999999
like I'm especially in the evening after

9659.2 --> 9665.52
after dark it's like I'm just buzzing

9661.279 --> 9665.52
with inspiration and just like holy

9665.72 --> 9673.479
[Â __Â ] got so much ideas and like

9669.8 --> 9673.479
connections that I'm suddenly

9678.24 --> 9683.08
making

9680.96 --> 9685.08
yeah thanks for that woodwork I'm

9683.08 --> 9687.76
definitely not going to change it to mag

9685.08 --> 9693.399
magenta I hate that

9687.76 --> 9695.0
color I hate magenta like I I genuinely

9693.399 --> 9698.56
hate

9695.0 --> 9701.12
it despise it if you

9698.56 --> 9703.68
will I always

9701.12 --> 9706.84
have I hate that

9703.68 --> 9708.24
color when somebody does that it pisses

9706.84 --> 9711.24
me

9708.24 --> 9711.24
off

9713.88 --> 9718.8
like an emerald

9715.359 --> 9722.04
green I'm okay with that although like

9718.8 --> 9725.519999999999
it's not great or anything

9722.04 --> 9730.68
but like I like

9725.52 --> 9730.68
green but magenta is just I hate

9731.0 --> 9738.16
it

9733.24 --> 9741.16
aanda TS under two Eclipse path

9738.16 --> 9741.16
what

9741.479 --> 9745.24
okay hello blue

9748.92 --> 9762.8
[Music]

9761.0 --> 9765.84
Evolution right I'm going to take a two

9762.8 --> 9765.84
minute break I'll be right

9768.12 --> 9771.12
back

9798.12 --> 9801.12
for

9828.04 --> 9831.04
e

9858.04 --> 9861.04
for

9888.04 --> 9891.04
for

9893.96 --> 9896.24
I'm

9896.64 --> 9901.479
back Predator Vision what are you

9899.16 --> 9901.479
talking

9905.479 --> 9911.24
about coyota

9908.24 --> 9911.24
hunting

9911.359 --> 9914.359
okay

9917.96 --> 9922.399
right

9919.2 --> 9922.399000000001
[Music]

9947.92 --> 9954.72
for

9949.56 --> 9959.119999999999
looks like the path of totality is South

9954.72 --> 9962.119999999999
West to Northeast

9959.12 --> 9962.12
what

9963.04 --> 9966.04
what

9972.16 --> 9980.279
okay really so I didn't just mix that up

9976.8 --> 9984.438999999998
so there is like another claim to it

9980.279 --> 9984.439
it what that is so

9991.56 --> 9994.56
weird

9995.16 --> 10001.72
that how does that make any

9999.08 --> 10006.8
sense I mean there can't be like two

10001.72 --> 10010.84
solar eclipses at the same time like

10006.8 --> 10010.84
are no

10011.68 --> 10018.92
no are you are you suggesting

10016.72 --> 10023.679999999998
that there might

10018.92 --> 10025.72
be two solar eclipses that are going to

10023.68 --> 10028.04
cross each

10025.72 --> 10032.679999999998
other

10028.04 --> 10037.84
what holy [Â __Â ] that would

10032.68 --> 10040.84
be unbelievable if that was actually the

10037.84 --> 10040.84
case

10043.92 --> 10049.960000000001
and probably a lot of people will then

10045.6 --> 10053.960000000001
say Oh it's Nuru Nuru did it's another

10049.96 --> 10053.96
secret planet next to the

10060.68 --> 10066.0
Moon one already happened what are you

10063.68 --> 10070.24
talking

10066.0 --> 10073.2
about but seriously is that actually a

10070.24 --> 10077.76
thing I mean that's pretty amazing also

10073.2 --> 10083.2
because of the symbol of that like if it

10077.76 --> 10088.56
would be a cross like the to the United

10083.2 --> 10088.560000000001
States like that that is like kind of

10097.72 --> 10100.72
magical

10101.319 --> 10105.92
but I mean I can't wait I can't wait for

10103.56 --> 10108.92
people to report out on that it's like

10105.92 --> 10111.439
yeah we're here in Washington state and

10108.92 --> 10113.960000000001
already the first solar eclipse has been

10111.439 --> 10116.439
spotted and like yeah and we're here

10113.96 --> 10118.88
over at the southern point of California

10116.439 --> 10120.65
where we're also seeing the solar

10118.88 --> 10123.199999999999
eclipse

10120.65 --> 10124.96
[Music]

10123.2 --> 10127.04
what

10124.96 --> 10130.679999999998
but

10127.04 --> 10133.279
how we don't know no it's really

10130.68 --> 10135.08
freaking us

10133.279 --> 10139.439
out

10135.08 --> 10139.439
dude I never even thought of

10139.6 --> 10145.6
that this could be a really bizarre

10143.6 --> 10150.439
Revelation and I

10145.6 --> 10154.0
mean it would explain the extreme

10150.439 --> 10157.08
significance I mean if the founding

10154.0 --> 10160.16
fathers would have seen that coming

10157.08 --> 10162.399
literally that it would be a cross a

10160.16 --> 10165.479
cross that would come over the United

10162.399 --> 10167.88
States in a solar eclipse which would

10165.479 --> 10167.88
like

10168.0 --> 10173.6
totally undo entirety of HELOC centrism

10171.52 --> 10177.720000000001
like it makes no damn sense like you

10173.6 --> 10179.92
cannot possibly make any remaining sense

10177.72 --> 10182.16
of such a Celestial event if that would

10179.92 --> 10182.16
to

10186.64 --> 10193.56
happen but Sons yeah but I

10190.12 --> 10193.560000000001
mean lots of

10195.96 --> 10203.199999999999
suns it is across two separate Eclipse

10199.72 --> 10205.88
you mean one after the other or

10203.2 --> 10208.0
something so not simultaneous because

10205.88 --> 10212.119999999999
that would be absolutely

10208.0 --> 10216.08
magical like that would be really mind

10212.12 --> 10219.319000000001
defying magic like what how can it

10216.08 --> 10222.68
be it's eclipsed over there and eclipsed

10219.319 --> 10224.439
over there like how can it be eclipsed

10222.68 --> 10226.76
at two place at the same time by the

10224.439 --> 10231.12
same body that makes no damn

10226.76 --> 10231.12
sense one already happened

10231.96 --> 10234.96
where

10236.88 --> 10242.56
when okay not at the same time okay fair

10247.64 --> 10250.64
enough

10251.92 --> 10256.88
a few years

10253.52 --> 10258.12
ago okay but look there's been multiple

10256.88 --> 10261.119999999999
different

10258.12 --> 10263.399000000001
eclipses I mean in the last 10 years

10261.12 --> 10265.319000000001
it's been like all over the freaking

10263.399 --> 10269.599999999999
place it's like one after another like

10265.319 --> 10269.6
oh another eclipse it's like oh another

10270.04 --> 10275.479000000001
eclipse okay another eclipse whatever I

10273.64 --> 10278.8
mean that's literally been my attitude

10275.479 --> 10279.96
it's like yeah yeah okay another eclipse

10278.8 --> 10282.399
okay

10279.96 --> 10285.239
fine

10282.399 --> 10287.479
but I mean this one does seem kind of

10285.239 --> 10290.479
significant specifically because it's

10287.479 --> 10294.399
going to pass all these towns called

10290.479 --> 10296.72
nineve and that makes it quite

10294.399 --> 10299.84
significant because that means that

10296.72 --> 10303.72
there was an anticipation to that

10299.84 --> 10307.52
Celestial event happening also a

10303.72 --> 10311.8
cross is a kind of a significant

10307.52 --> 10318.479000000001
symbol for the United States

10311.8 --> 10322.199999999999
flag was a cross not a big part of the

10318.479 --> 10322.199999999999
uh Confederate

10323.12 --> 10329.2
flag you know isn't that wasn't the

10326.359 --> 10330.800000000001
Confederate flag like a big

10329.2 --> 10334.68
blue

10330.8 --> 10340.519999999999
blue dark the dark like a

10334.68 --> 10340.52
shadow cross over the flag

10345.56 --> 10348.479
isn't that kind of

10349.8 --> 10357.56
significant it it almost again like it

10352.76 --> 10361.04
just plays into that idea of a phoenix

10357.56 --> 10363.88
event right what what was the

10361.04 --> 10366.800000000001
Confederacy well it's heavily lied about

10363.88 --> 10370.399
oh they just wanted to keep slavery no

10366.8 --> 10374.96
they weren't they were actually the good

10370.399 --> 10374.96
guys the north was all about freaking

10375.84 --> 10382.6
slavery yeah so maybe there is this yeah

10381.319 --> 10386.479
some kind of

10382.6 --> 10388.52
weird Celestial prediction that

10386.479 --> 10391.72
even

10388.52 --> 10394.720000000001
imbus the spirit of the

10391.72 --> 10395.92
Confederacy upon these times what you

10394.72 --> 10400.438999999998
said between

10395.92 --> 10400.439
2017 and 2024

10400.68 --> 10408.2
that the cross of the Confederate flag

10404.2 --> 10410.84
as a Celestial invent is being marked on

10408.2 --> 10414.16
the United States that's kind of a

10410.84 --> 10414.16
fascinating idea isn't

10414.96 --> 10419.599999999999
it it's fascinating enough that I'm

10417.16 --> 10422.8
going to write it down and make it into

10419.6 --> 10422.800000000001
the title for tomorrow

10427.439 --> 10430.439
show

10457.399 --> 10460.319
yeah

10461.64 --> 10466.119999999999
good thing I Mark that down I mean this

10463.84 --> 10467.34
is re this is getting more and more

10466.12 --> 10470.45
interesting as I

10467.34 --> 10470.45
[Music]

10476.359 --> 10480.6
go am I not

10478.92 --> 10484.279
right

10480.6 --> 10484.279
just let me look it

10487.319 --> 10490.319
up

10499.76 --> 10506.960000000001
you

10501.84 --> 10506.960000000001
mean that's stupid ass

10515.16 --> 10520.319
thing I mean the yeah

10524.239 --> 10527.68
how dare you this is not a political

10525.88 --> 10532.0
statement I'm making and besides I'm

10527.68 --> 10535.52
Dutch so who gives a [Â __Â ] but like

10532.0 --> 10535.52
doesn't this kind of

10536.12 --> 10542.319000000001
look as uh you know a certain Celestial

10543.479 --> 10550.0
event like even the stars are in the

10547.239 --> 10553.8
cross which is like

10550.0 --> 10557.68
yeah the stars make a

10553.8 --> 10557.679999999998
cross across the

10558.2 --> 10564.76
land the land being red like the life

10561.52 --> 10569.359
blood the people the nation the blood of

10564.76 --> 10573.279
the nation the people the Stars making a

10569.359 --> 10576.12
cross the celestial event making a cross

10573.279 --> 10576.12
I mean

10577.239 --> 10581.359
damn is getting

10581.88 --> 10585.8
uh getting weird and

10595.04 --> 10598.12
interesting I

10598.16 --> 10607.239
mean I can't unsee that now I don't know

10602.439 --> 10610.239
about you but like I can't unsee that

10607.239 --> 10610.239
now

10615.88 --> 10619.92
the Templar crosses mind

10637.16 --> 10641.489
whatever

10638.28 --> 10641.489000000001
[Music]

10649.68 --> 10654.720000000001
oh by the way this is very typical

10651.439 --> 10657.720000000001
you're saying the eclipse is April 8th

10654.72 --> 10659.96
well that's also when wit it is g to

10657.72 --> 10665.399
have his show

10659.96 --> 10665.399
released on Joe Rogan it's April

10665.64 --> 10670.399
8th I'm sure that's just a complete

10668.8 --> 10674.278999999999
coincidence

10670.399 --> 10674.278999999999
right it's totally a

10689.93 --> 10693.049
[Music]

10696.72 --> 10701.039999999999
coincidence no for their Celestial

10699.16 --> 10703.239
rituals yeah but duper I mean this is

10701.04 --> 10705.6
more than just a ritual this is not like

10703.239 --> 10708.68
a bunch of old Geyers coming together in

10705.6 --> 10712.68
the woods and like oh we're going to do

10708.68 --> 10716.279
a sacrifice no this is this is like a a

10712.68 --> 10720.16
Celestial event that's like significant

10716.279 --> 10724.239
enough that it seems like an entire flag

10720.16 --> 10726.84
was made based off it and I mean all

10724.239 --> 10730.08
these towns being named

10726.84 --> 10734.08
Neve in its exact pathway

10730.08 --> 10737.399
like that is like really significant

10734.08 --> 10740.56
like you can't just scoop it up as a

10737.399 --> 10742.88
coincidence anymore like the founding

10740.56 --> 10746.76
fathers the people that

10742.88 --> 10748.839999999998
arranged the naming of towns and cities

10746.76 --> 10752.2
in the early days of the United States

10748.84 --> 10755.279
and its formation were obviously aware

10752.2 --> 10758.76
about this Celestial event

10755.279 --> 10762.2
and adapt it to it

10758.76 --> 10763.359
by naming these towns this which then

10762.2 --> 10767.04
carries

10763.359 --> 10769.640000000001
a very strong

10767.04 --> 10772.92
symbolic meaning to it based on the

10769.64 --> 10776.519999999999
Bible and the association of

10772.92 --> 10777.8
Neve and it all points at a giant

10776.52 --> 10779.880000000001
Phoenix

10777.8 --> 10783.199999999999
event all of

10779.88 --> 10788.358999999999
it symbol of the Civil War yeah yeah I

10783.2 --> 10790.68
mean it's like boom like ah like how I'm

10788.359 --> 10793.359
sorry how this is not even like an

10790.68 --> 10797.800000000001
arnian prediction anymore this is just

10793.359 --> 10801.319
like the most extreme in your

10797.8 --> 10801.319
face thing

10802.56 --> 10805.56
ever

10806.439 --> 10811.359
ever this is not even a prediction I'm

10809.319 --> 10814.519999999999
making anymore this is a prediction the

10811.359 --> 10816.960000000001
freaking founding fathers

10814.52 --> 10819.960000000001
[Music]

10816.96 --> 10819.96
made

10828.239 --> 10833.399
good good no duper I've already talked

10830.56 --> 10836.479
about that an hour

10833.399 --> 10839.0
ago yeah if you want to actually

10836.479 --> 10843.479
understand what a show is about then

10839.0 --> 10846.479
don't come joining in in the last 30

10843.479 --> 10846.479
minutes

10846.92 --> 10849.92
yeah

10876.92 --> 10881.68
for

10879.2 --> 10884.6
all right but uh yeah I will definitely

10881.68 --> 10886.84
revisit this subject tomorrow I really

10884.6 --> 10888.16
wanted to talk about paradoxical

10886.84 --> 10889.880000000001
simultaneity in the quantum

10888.16 --> 10891.52
superposition of the

10889.88 --> 10894.08
Consciousness

10891.52 --> 10896.439
but even though that is very interesting

10894.08 --> 10899.08
it didn't seem like there was a lot of

10896.439 --> 10903.2
enimo for that I had trouble even

10899.08 --> 10905.8
rolling it out staying focused but this

10903.2 --> 10908.399000000001
subject's just like really up in

10905.8 --> 10910.239
everybody's mind for some reason and

10908.399 --> 10913.039999999999
well discovering what I just discovered

10910.239 --> 10914.68
about it I mean not surprising not

10913.04 --> 10917.720000000001
surprising that everybody is on

10914.68 --> 10917.720000000001
everybody's mind right

10920.68 --> 10926.92
now prediction gain credit dude Woodwork

10924.64 --> 10929.64
and gun bear I'm sure it's going to be

10926.92 --> 10932.960000000001
all over the weekend streams now

10929.64 --> 10934.68
especially now that I'm like or like

10932.96 --> 10938.119999999999
over the coming

10934.68 --> 10941.6
week especially since tomorrow's show

10938.12 --> 10941.6
title is going to roughly

10942.88 --> 10948.119999999999
be flat Earth early bird

10949.359 --> 10953.399000000001
194 the N

10953.68 --> 10960.64
eclipse the N Eclipse Phoenix event and

10957.64 --> 10962.76
the Confederate flag like it's going to

10960.64 --> 10967.479
be something like that the

10962.76 --> 10969.64
title so I mean this is going to hit off

10967.479 --> 10971.64
hard

10969.64 --> 10975.358999999999
like it doesn't matter like it's it's

10971.64 --> 10977.0
just Arwin Arwin we don't nobody knows

10975.359 --> 10979.960000000001
about him yeah everybody's gonna [Â __Â ]

10977.0 --> 10979.96
talk about it

10986.2 --> 10991.6
everybody it's going to blow everybody's

10989.04 --> 10994.76
Minds like

10991.6 --> 10996.56
Beyond like I just put down a couple of

10994.76 --> 11000.64
limited things and insights and

10996.56 --> 11003.399
predictions and it's like yeah all of

11000.64 --> 11005.88
you the rest of humanity you can all

11003.399 --> 11008.92
figure out like all these patterns that

11005.88 --> 11012.319
are like that I practically don't even

11008.92 --> 11014.439
care about like oh oh wow the geometra

11012.319 --> 11016.239
works out oh the math works out oh this

11014.439 --> 11018.76
and that all historical references oh

11016.239 --> 11021.68
look at what we dug up like yeah that's

11018.76 --> 11023.960000000001
cool like I technically don't even care

11021.68 --> 11025.800000000001
about it I just knew there was something

11023.96 --> 11028.399
really coming I've been feeling it

11025.8 --> 11030.358999999999
before I even became conscious of it

11028.399 --> 11032.56
there's an enormous energy

11030.359 --> 11036.399000000001
buildup there is

11032.56 --> 11040.08
a a change of the scenario happening and

11036.399 --> 11041.96
it's all leading up to this inevitable

11040.08 --> 11045.239
critical mass

11041.96 --> 11045.239
point it's

11045.56 --> 11052.199999999999
happening and these are merely the signs

11048.319 --> 11054.519999999999
that it was foreseen and significant

11052.2 --> 11057.84
enough for the

11054.52 --> 11059.2
architects of the modern state of the

11057.84 --> 11063.399
modern

11059.2 --> 11068.720000000001
states to literally play into that to

11063.399 --> 11068.72
that level so it's very very

11074.479 --> 11081.64
significant flags with

11077.63 --> 11081.64
[Music]

11084.56 --> 11090.0
whaton Dix Civil War Bo of

11116.64 --> 11119.64
fascinating

11127.359 --> 11134.319
right but yeah uh anybody still in what

11132.279 --> 11136.359
fat fer fingers yeah that's

11134.319 --> 11140.8
cool

11136.359 --> 11144.439
just just read what you typed before you

11140.8 --> 11144.438999999998
press enter that's my

11146.319 --> 11151.72
recommendation all right

11148.359 --> 11151.720000000001
plenty of time to type it

11151.84 --> 11157.319
down but uh yeah I kind of wanted to

11155.68 --> 11160.439
still talk about paradoxical

11157.319 --> 11162.239
simultaneity but maybe like everybody's

11160.439 --> 11165.880000000001
just too distracted by

11162.239 --> 11169.64
this maybe I'll come back to

11165.88 --> 11171.199999999999
it right what is paradoxical

11169.64 --> 11175.119999999999
simultaneity

11171.2 --> 11176.560000000001
about it's about the

11175.12 --> 11179.560000000001
[Music]

11176.56 --> 11179.56
philosophical

11181.359 --> 11186.399000000001
presupposition

11183.399 --> 11186.399
Foundation

11186.439 --> 11191.880000000001
within religious conception of how God

11189.72 --> 11192.84
designed things did he designed things

11191.88 --> 11196.119999999999
to

11192.84 --> 11199.6
be deterministic like are things going

11196.12 --> 11201.479000000001
to happen no matter what and in from

11199.6 --> 11203.52
that perspective we don't have free will

11201.479 --> 11204.599999999999
or do we have free will and that that

11203.52 --> 11207.880000000001
Free

11204.6 --> 11209.16
Will is truly free and can actually

11207.88 --> 11211.679999999998
change

11209.16 --> 11214.92
things well those different

11211.68 --> 11219.68
philosophical assumptions are in

11214.92 --> 11222.439
direct opposition of one another and

11219.68 --> 11225.880000000001
so to assume that they would exist

11222.439 --> 11225.880000000001
simultaneously would be

11226.479 --> 11231.16
paradoxical

11228.399 --> 11236.519999999999
but does that

11231.16 --> 11239.64
exclude them from being simultaneously

11236.52 --> 11243.12
possible yeah and that's where the idea

11239.64 --> 11247.68
of paradoxical simultaneity comes in

11243.12 --> 11250.319000000001
because of the unique qualities of the

11247.68 --> 11254.720000000001
Consciousness perhaps the

11250.319 --> 11256.359
Consciousness can have a Quantum like

11254.72 --> 11260.199999999999
superposition

11256.359 --> 11262.640000000001
between determinism and Free Will that

11260.2 --> 11265.0
it is dependent on our

11262.64 --> 11269.439
perspective within the

11265.0 --> 11269.439
Consciousness that basically determines

11269.68 --> 11276.16
how it will work which would be by the

11273.0 --> 11277.96
way a Consciousness Centric Universe in

11276.16 --> 11282.6
a

11277.96 --> 11282.599999999999
way that it is centered around the

11289.479 --> 11296.599999999999
Consciousness and you could even say

11291.68 --> 11298.399
that God the ultimate designer centers

11296.6 --> 11302.439
the universe

11298.399 --> 11303.439
and how it will go around the Free Will

11302.439 --> 11307.0
of the

11303.439 --> 11310.92
Consciousness that Embraces Free

11307.0 --> 11312.08
Will while letting those that surrender

11310.92 --> 11315.359
to

11312.08 --> 11318.92
determinism just be part of the

11315.359 --> 11322.0
determinism as was also laid out the

11318.92 --> 11325.04
autopilot the railroad system that's

11322.0 --> 11326.439
always there default Behavior people

11325.04 --> 11328.319000000001
fall back

11326.439 --> 11330.359
into

11328.319 --> 11333.68
like there

11330.359 --> 11336.12
is autopilot systems for the

11333.68 --> 11339.6
Consciousness on every

11336.12 --> 11341.92
level available for those who like can't

11339.6 --> 11347.76
get a grip with their consciences can't

11341.92 --> 11351.279
find the will to be free you see and

11347.76 --> 11353.439
so it is a very interesting

11351.279 --> 11355.239
consideration that there may be

11353.439 --> 11357.720000000001
paradoxical

11355.239 --> 11359.399
simultaneity through a Quantum

11357.72 --> 11364.519999999999
superposition of the

11359.399 --> 11368.88
Consciousness within it within God's

11364.52 --> 11373.04
design so that everything is both

11368.88 --> 11375.599999999999
deterministic and purely centered around

11373.04 --> 11379.12
the the consequences of Free Will

11375.6 --> 11383.279
simultaneously despite them logically

11379.12 --> 11385.800000000001
being paradoxically in opposition to one

11383.279 --> 11387.92
another I thought it was an interesting

11385.8 --> 11391.56
enough consideration to put it into the

11387.92 --> 11395.72
title it certainly blew my mind when I

11391.56 --> 11395.72
when I realized this yesterday

11395.8 --> 11402.96
night

11398.72 --> 11402.96
so maybe we'll get back to

11416.319 --> 11421.479
that

11418.64 --> 11424.319
no would work any be that's not how that

11421.479 --> 11426.319
works no it's not AI that changes what

11424.319 --> 11432.278999999999
you type

11426.319 --> 11435.68
it's your hasted ree assumptive view

11432.279 --> 11438.84
that blinds you from what you actually

11435.68 --> 11440.76
typed by seeing what you anticipated not

11438.84 --> 11442.960000000001
what you actually

11440.76 --> 11444.84
typed you're basically creating a

11442.96 --> 11447.319
Mandela effect on

11444.84 --> 11451.880000000001
yourself you're seeing what you want

11447.319 --> 11451.88
wanted to type not what you actually

11452.76 --> 11458.319
type it's all born from in

11476.239 --> 11480.239
patience

11478.68 --> 11483.84
right if you want to do it right you're

11480.239 --> 11486.52
going to have to actually read honestly

11483.84 --> 11490.16
like you're reading a new thing that

11486.52 --> 11494.439
isn't yours what you typed and not while

11490.16 --> 11497.119999999999
you read it think about what you want it

11494.439 --> 11497.12
to be

11497.319 --> 11504.16
typed that's exactly what I want you to

11499.84 --> 11506.239
think well maybe not let AI

11504.16 --> 11508.439
dictate your

11506.239 --> 11513.76
thoughts

11508.439 --> 11516.68
the perceived AI yeah like Ai No is you

11513.76 --> 11520.08
you're probably joking at this point can

11516.68 --> 11522.359
you bring up a different subject no no

11520.08 --> 11524.84
you can't

11522.359 --> 11526.52
duper if you want to bring up a subject

11524.84 --> 11529.479
you're going to have to do it somewhere

11526.52 --> 11532.720000000001
within the first hour of the show and

11529.479 --> 11532.72
not after 3

11536.16 --> 11539.16
hours

11562.479 --> 11566.119999999999
it's

11563.479 --> 11572.278999999999
already a quarter past

11566.12 --> 11572.279
5 so I am going to round out the show

11576.68 --> 11582.68
soon but it's certainly been a

11579.6 --> 11586.439
very enervating show today and I

11582.68 --> 11586.439
expected that with just the title

11586.76 --> 11592.439
alone very interesting consideration and

11589.72 --> 11593.84
then ending up talking about the well

11592.439 --> 11594.92
what the title for tomorrow show is

11593.84 --> 11600.92
going to be

11594.92 --> 11604.84
about the n Eclipse based phix Phoenix

11600.92 --> 11609.279
event prediction and the bizarre

11604.84 --> 11609.279
Confederate flag pattern of the

11610.64 --> 11615.96
eclipses may as well go 5 hours

11624.399 --> 11629.039999999999
no no that's a bit much blue

11645.0 --> 11649.0
Evolution yeah that's right it was

11651.12 --> 11662.52
G AI is is nothing but just a giant

11656.04 --> 11664.480000000001
database and a simulator of a human like

11662.52 --> 11668.309000000001
mind that's all it

11664.48 --> 11668.309
[Music]

11668.399 --> 11676.039999999999
is it it can't figure out anything

11672.88 --> 11676.039999999999
new at

11679.359 --> 11685.04
all like it can't even logically draw

11682.56 --> 11688.08
conclusions and then follow up on the

11685.04 --> 11692.04
logically drawn conclusions without you

11688.08 --> 11694.2
specifically ordering to do so like you

11692.04 --> 11697.12
have to tell exactly what it needs to

11694.2 --> 11700.560000000001
presuppose because if you don't like it

11697.12 --> 11704.640000000001
just won't understand things why because

11700.56 --> 11708.359
it literally doesn't have the concept of

11704.64 --> 11711.96
understanding things it only has

11708.359 --> 11714.880000000001
accepting information as true as a

11711.96 --> 11719.8
premise for the continuation of inquiry

11714.88 --> 11723.438999999998
like that's all it has ual understanding

11719.8 --> 11725.64
knowing is not something AI can

11723.439 --> 11727.76
do you have to have an actual

11725.64 --> 11730.88
Consciousness to do such

11727.76 --> 11734.12
things now it can simulate it but it

11730.88 --> 11734.119999999999
can't actually do

11740.7 --> 11743.809000000001
[Music]

11745.56 --> 11750.319
it yeah

11748.08 --> 11754.199
Evolution

11750.319 --> 11754.198999999999
yeah Alexa is kind of

11755.04 --> 11763.399000000001
[Â __Â ] I I don't know why people have

11759.239 --> 11766.039999999999
those things I really really

11763.399 --> 11769.68
don't remember where people were

11766.04 --> 11772.960000000001
terrified about being spied upon by

11769.68 --> 11772.960000000001
government through their

11773.6 --> 11779.84
telephones and then they got

11775.92 --> 11782.6
smartphones which are literally spy

11779.84 --> 11785.6
devices that you can that you can and

11782.6 --> 11788.12
usually have to take with you everywhere

11785.6 --> 11791.08
and then they just have like a corporate

11788.12 --> 11792.319000000001
device that listens to you on record all

11791.08 --> 11795.64
the

11792.319 --> 11799.92
time that's like corporate

11795.64 --> 11802.68
owned like unconditional like it's

11799.92 --> 11804.64
expected to listen to you all the time

11802.68 --> 11807.319
and basically record everything you say

11804.64 --> 11810.68
in anticipation of that you might order

11807.319 --> 11813.16
it to do something yeah and then people

11810.68 --> 11818.64
have those devices in their house I'm

11813.16 --> 11818.64
like you people are like completely

11818.72 --> 11823.479
[Â __Â ] I mean people that think that

11821.399 --> 11824.8
that's a good idea are the same people

11823.479 --> 11826.64
that are going to eventually have a

11824.8 --> 11829.519999999999
freaking chip in their

11826.64 --> 11831.76
head that eventually will lead to the

11829.52 --> 11834.359
chip giving you orders instead of the

11831.76 --> 11836.08
other way around and they'll still

11834.359 --> 11838.84
accept it because they're [Â __Â ]

11836.08 --> 11838.84
[Â __Â ]

11847.08 --> 11851.88
eclipses don't seem to be as rare as

11848.68 --> 11851.880000000001
they claim

11853.6 --> 11858.0
uh all depends on the era

11861.6 --> 11867.720000000001
duper in this current period there seems

11864.6 --> 11871.800000000001
to be a lot of eclipses

11867.72 --> 11874.599999999999
and very significant ones special ones

11871.8 --> 11876.519999999999
but that is an exception to the rule

11874.6 --> 11878.56
that is an

11876.52 --> 11882.04
exceptional

11878.56 --> 11886.039999999999
time it normally doesn't happen that

11882.04 --> 11889.880000000001
often but also you got to realize that

11886.04 --> 11893.359
because of media and internet we are all

11889.88 --> 11895.399
much more aware of ecliptic events

11893.359 --> 11898.76
around the

11895.399 --> 11902.439
world some that we didn't really have

11898.76 --> 11905.359
all that much say 40 years

11902.439 --> 11908.52
ago the only way we would hear about an

11905.359 --> 11909.399000000001
eclipse is if it was said to happen on

11908.52 --> 11912.399000000001
the

11909.399 --> 11915.239
news and the News wouldn't always report

11912.399 --> 11918.0
out on these things now we have entire

11915.239 --> 11920.88
websites that are just tracking this

11918.0 --> 11923.279
type of celestial event Non-Stop and

11920.88 --> 11925.88
give you maps with predictions of when

11923.279 --> 11928.04
it's going to happen right we didn't

11925.88 --> 11931.438999999998
have that 40 years ago that was not a

11928.04 --> 11934.439
public available thing back then so you

11931.439 --> 11935.68
got to realize that the the curve of

11934.439 --> 11940.12
public

11935.68 --> 11942.76
awareness has caught up onto the actual

11940.12 --> 11944.050000000001
reality of all the eclipses that happen

11942.76 --> 11947.18
on

11944.05 --> 11947.179999999998
[Music]

11949.08 --> 11953.56
Earth what kind of question is that

11955.72 --> 11958.72
duper

11968.319 --> 11975.64
annoying do you have any idea how a

11972.76 --> 11978.16
non-local holographic angular

11975.64 --> 11982.119999999999
manifestation seeming to block out an

11978.16 --> 11985.64
other non-local holographic

11982.12 --> 11988.399000000001
manifestation within a spatially looping

11985.64 --> 11990.198999999999
confine

11988.399 --> 11993.08
what the hell does the spatial looping

11990.199 --> 11996.319000000001
confine have to do with the the

11993.08 --> 11999.039999999999
mysteries of the celestials like why

11996.319 --> 11999.039999999999
wouldn't it

12004.16 --> 12009.76
work like what the hell does it have to

12006.8 --> 12013.56
do with

12009.76 --> 12015.239
it the celestials function as non-local

12013.56 --> 12017.64
holographic angular

12015.239 --> 12021.439
manifestations Within our

12017.64 --> 12025.039999999999
site doesn't matter where that site is

12021.439 --> 12028.239
if it is in a contained non-looping

12025.04 --> 12031.319000000001
realm or in a contained looping realm

12028.239 --> 12037.0
like I don't see how that matters one

12031.319 --> 12040.119999999999
bit like why wouldn't it work

12037.0 --> 12042.08
duper the only reason why I can think of

12040.12 --> 12045.04
that you would consider that it wouldn't

12042.08 --> 12047.68
work is because you literally don't

12045.04 --> 12050.239000000001
understand it at all like neither the

12047.68 --> 12052.279
looping confine conception nor the

12050.239 --> 12054.56
non-local holographic angular

12052.279 --> 12056.319000000001
manifestation of the

12054.56 --> 12059.239
celestials

12056.319 --> 12061.96
CU from everything I've explained there

12059.239 --> 12065.319
is no reason to even

12061.96 --> 12067.72
question how it would work in relation

12065.319 --> 12067.72
to one

12071.279 --> 12077.479000000001
another what their locations are there

12074.16 --> 12079.479
are no actual locations

12077.479 --> 12082.16
they're just angular

12079.479 --> 12085.16
manifestations in a very specific

12082.16 --> 12085.16
cyclical

12091.399 --> 12097.039999999999
pattern they go where they

12093.8 --> 12100.84
go across the

12097.04 --> 12100.84
available surface of

12105.52 --> 12108.52
Earth

12117.319 --> 12123.84
well you don't have to stop asking

12118.88 --> 12123.839999999998
questions I just want an answer like

12124.76 --> 12129.52
why what makes you think that it

12127.08 --> 12129.52
couldn't

12129.92 --> 12138.52
work like I don't know what the hell an

12133.0 --> 12138.52
eclipse is I don't know how

12139.16 --> 12146.0
a non-local holographic angular

12142.199 --> 12150.279
manifestation can be angular wise

12146.0 --> 12152.52
blocked out by a or negated by another

12150.279 --> 12156.04
non-local holographic angular

12152.52 --> 12158.68
manifestation yeah I don't know

12156.04 --> 12161.880000000001
that I don't even know how these lights

12158.68 --> 12165.6
are forming the way they are how that

12161.88 --> 12168.0
works how do I then know how one blocks

12165.6 --> 12171.479000000001
out the other negates it I mean it's all

12168.0 --> 12173.72
a gigantic mystery I don't know how to

12171.479 --> 12178.119999999999
back engineer it at

12173.72 --> 12182.198999999999
all it's hard enough to even describe

12178.12 --> 12184.439
how to conceive of it to to know to

12182.199 --> 12186.199
realize what's happening is already

12184.439 --> 12189.319
difficult enough as it is let alone try

12186.199 --> 12191.52
to back engineer it but I don't see how

12189.319 --> 12198.439
this relates to

12191.52 --> 12198.439
the limited available volume of the loop

12202.88 --> 12207.08
realm you asking how it would work

12205.479 --> 12210.72
because you don't know yeah welcome to

12207.08 --> 12210.72
the club duper I don't know

12210.8 --> 12217.479
either I know just enough to be able to

12214.0 --> 12223.12
describe what I think it is not how it

12217.479 --> 12225.438999999998
is at all I don't know how it is at all

12223.12 --> 12229.319000000001
I don't even know where to

12225.439 --> 12232.12
begin yeah it's hard enough to describe

12229.319 --> 12235.198999999999
what I think it

12232.12 --> 12237.239000000001
is yeah I mean you try to explain to

12235.199 --> 12239.359
people hey you see those lights in the

12237.239 --> 12242.52
sky they're not actually objects

12239.359 --> 12244.04
radiating light it just seems like that

12242.52 --> 12246.880000000001
there's light arriving but it's

12244.04 --> 12250.479000000001
literally not coming from anything yeah

12246.88 --> 12250.479
you try to explain that to

12255.359 --> 12258.359
people

12259.6 --> 12265.399000000001
I'm just glad I've been able to figure

12262.08 --> 12266.96
out a a sequence of words to to attempt

12265.399 --> 12271.68
that

12266.96 --> 12275.72
yeah non-local holographic angular

12271.68 --> 12278.279
manifestations I mean that's the best I

12275.72 --> 12280.8
can do that actually summarizes the

12278.279 --> 12280.800000000001
entire

12285.319 --> 12292.439
concept

12287.72 --> 12295.84
right but just that I can describe

12292.439 --> 12299.800000000001
it away from the traditional physicality

12295.84 --> 12302.6
assumption biased way of seeing those

12299.8 --> 12305.92
things thinking about them doesn't mean

12302.6 --> 12310.12
that I know how the [Â __Â ] it

12305.92 --> 12313.239
works why it works I don't know I don't

12310.12 --> 12313.239000000001
even know where to

12315.319 --> 12318.319
begin

12320.64 --> 12327.319
an angular manifestation means that the

12323.359 --> 12327.319
light manifests without a

12327.8 --> 12338.08
source yeah angular manifestation means

12331.16 --> 12343.16
it manifests as from an angle not from a

12338.08 --> 12343.16
thing that is why I call it an angular

12345.239 --> 12348.239
manifestation

12350.05 --> 12356.198999999999
[Music]

12352.16 --> 12356.199
all right let me bring out the sketch

12369.319 --> 12372.64
again where is

12375.239 --> 12378.239
it

12378.56 --> 12385.119999999999
I should update this at some point maybe

12381.279 --> 12385.12
make it nah it's just fine the way it

12385.76 --> 12392.68
is I'm just a pencil sketch

12389.0 --> 12395.88
guy and that's the way it

12392.68 --> 12398.92
is so here you

12395.88 --> 12401.8
go on the right we have the traditional

12398.92 --> 12404.399
way of thinking about how the celestial

12401.8 --> 12407.198999999999
lights work in this case the sun being

12404.399 --> 12410.399
this apparent sphere

12407.199 --> 12413.279
that then radiates light all the way

12410.399 --> 12416.72
down that's how especially Flat Earth

12413.279 --> 12418.720000000001
discus think about the Sun that it is a

12416.72 --> 12421.239
literal object at a certain distance

12418.72 --> 12423.92
that somehow floats there and radiates

12421.239 --> 12426.039999999999
its light towards the Earth where it is

12423.92 --> 12428.56
absorbed even though none of that

12426.04 --> 12431.239000000001
actually can be really Justified nor is

12428.56 --> 12432.76
there any proof that it is an object at

12431.239 --> 12437.52
an actual

12432.76 --> 12439.960000000001
distance there's no tests to give any

12437.52 --> 12443.640000000001
conclusive evidence of an actual

12439.96 --> 12448.438999999998
location within ukan space on the left

12443.64 --> 12452.92
is a attempt at a depiction of my

12448.439 --> 12456.52
conception the angular manifestation of

12452.92 --> 12458.0
it and within the lines is where you

12456.52 --> 12463.359
would

12458.0 --> 12465.12
see the sun appear to be angular wise

12463.359 --> 12470.68
and the further you go

12465.12 --> 12474.399000000001
up then at some point it may literally

12470.68 --> 12477.56
disappear not be visible anymore even

12474.399 --> 12480.56
though when the angles added up it's

12477.56 --> 12484.68
supposed to be there like as people

12480.56 --> 12487.56
typically imagine it in the right

12484.68 --> 12492.04
side but in actuality when you go there

12487.56 --> 12495.278999999999
it isn't there it's nowhere cu the sun

12492.04 --> 12498.479000000001
cannot be proven to have an actual

12495.279 --> 12500.479000000001
position with within ukian space all we

12498.479 --> 12502.76
get to see is this

12500.479 --> 12505.0
apparent solar

12502.76 --> 12508.16
disc at the

12505.0 --> 12511.08
epicenter of where the angle of the

12508.16 --> 12511.08
sunlight comes

12511.64 --> 12517.479
from but you can't prove that it is a

12515.359 --> 12519.640000000001
primary thing that it is actually a

12517.479 --> 12521.8
thing a physical thing that radiates

12519.64 --> 12525.278999999999
this light it rather seems to be a

12521.8 --> 12527.519999999999
hologram at the epicenter of the angular

12525.279 --> 12530.319000000001
manifestation

12527.52 --> 12532.92
a side effect the sun dis we see and

12530.319 --> 12534.92
that blinds us when we stare at it

12532.92 --> 12539.960000000001
cannot be proven to be anything more

12534.92 --> 12544.279
than just a side effect of looking in

12539.96 --> 12544.278999999999
the direction of the angular

12551.199 --> 12558.04
manifestation long show today

12555.04 --> 12558.04
indeed

12565.0 --> 12571.68
long show that I am going to round out

12568.56 --> 12575.519999999999
however because uh I need a

12571.68 --> 12577.84
break going to get dizzy and [Â __Â ]

12575.52 --> 12580.84
eventually but yeah it's been intense

12577.84 --> 12583.12
intense subjects all around very intense

12580.84 --> 12584.199
subjects High intellectual subjects

12583.12 --> 12587.560000000001
things

12584.199 --> 12590.800000000001
that yeah that aren't just

12587.56 --> 12594.359
easily consumed this is not easy

12590.8 --> 12596.84
consumerism YouTube yeah yeah you

12594.359 --> 12599.439
actually have to like use your brain for

12596.84 --> 12602.479
this you might have to pause it and be

12599.439 --> 12603.76
like what the [Â __Â ] what the [Â __Â ] is he

12602.479 --> 12606.039999999999
talking

12603.76 --> 12608.92
about I don't get

12606.04 --> 12611.199
it yeah I'm sorry if you don't get it it

12608.92 --> 12614.04
is very tough and you might have

12611.199 --> 12616.76
to relisten to it a couple of times

12614.04 --> 12618.720000000001
maybe go back to previous streams or

12616.76 --> 12621.479
wait until I talk about it again and

12618.72 --> 12624.16
then maybe you'll get it the next

12621.479 --> 12626.399
time I'm certainly not expecting

12624.16 --> 12629.279
everybody who listens to this for the

12626.399 --> 12631.72
first time to just immediately get these

12629.279 --> 12634.279
complicated

12631.72 --> 12639.438999999998
conceptions right it is still pretty

12634.279 --> 12639.439
confusing yes I know duper I totally get

12639.88 --> 12645.56
it it is fine and it's fine that you're

12643.359 --> 12650.04
asking to I mean I'm going to probably

12645.56 --> 12650.039999999999
have to explain about the angular

12651.359 --> 12657.800000000001
manifestations many many more times

12655.0 --> 12660.76
because it is like one of the biggest

12657.8 --> 12663.16
physicality assumption bias breaking

12660.76 --> 12666.239
conceptions that has probably ever been

12663.16 --> 12670.039999999999
conceived in the history of

12666.239 --> 12674.08
humanity okay so it's not

12670.04 --> 12676.399000000001
surprising that you just don't get

12674.08 --> 12680.279
it there's been people that have

12676.399 --> 12682.96
followed me for years that after like

12680.279 --> 12685.76
five years of me explaining this they

12682.96 --> 12687.56
still don't get

12685.76 --> 12691.16
it

12687.56 --> 12694.64
so don't punish yourself for

12691.16 --> 12697.8
it just take your time and realize that

12694.64 --> 12698.76
whatever this world is it is the way it

12697.8 --> 12701.64
is

12698.76 --> 12704.6
designed and if it's too complex for you

12701.64 --> 12707.64
to understand well then

12704.6 --> 12709.199
maybe you don't really need to

12707.64 --> 12712.239
understand it all that

12709.199 --> 12714.560000000001
much right what is the necessity for you

12712.239 --> 12717.68
to completely Master the understanding

12714.56 --> 12720.319
of it why what is the function of you

12717.68 --> 12724.720000000001
completely mastering

12720.319 --> 12727.6
it I know it has a function for

12724.72 --> 12728.56
me but does it have that same function

12727.6 --> 12731.76
for

12728.56 --> 12731.76
you who

12733.359 --> 12739.479000000001
knows but at least I'm here to provide

12736.72 --> 12742.679999999998
the opportunity and to potentially break

12739.479 --> 12746.56
you out of the pre-assumed real world

12742.68 --> 12748.800000000001
types of mental

12746.56 --> 12753.56
preconstruction that have been created

12748.8 --> 12755.96
for us to get this idea we already

12753.56 --> 12758.239
understand and know everything yeah

12755.96 --> 12760.399
right yeah all Humanity figured

12758.239 --> 12763.56
everything out there's nothing left

12760.399 --> 12764.84
except everything everything is still

12763.56 --> 12767.8
completely

12764.84 --> 12771.08
misunderstood

12767.8 --> 12773.8
and like 80 years of just nonsense

12771.08 --> 12776.92
science that have been perpetuated and

12773.8 --> 12780.8
be reinforced and like people figuring

12776.92 --> 12784.52
out yeah holy [Â __Â ] it was all nonsense

12780.8 --> 12787.519999999999
all of it it's all presuppositional

12784.52 --> 12792.04
nonsense we've been LED down a false

12787.52 --> 12793.84
path and it's been designed to do that

12792.04 --> 12796.76
and people are figuring it

12793.84 --> 12799.479
out I've been ahead of that and I am

12796.76 --> 12802.239
trying to figure out what is

12799.479 --> 12805.76
real and the more I try to figure it out

12802.239 --> 12809.92
the more I realize that reality is quite

12805.76 --> 12812.72
surreal and not so easily

12809.92 --> 12816.76
straightforward comprehensible to the

12812.72 --> 12821.519999999999
human mind you have to really climb out

12816.76 --> 12823.92
of this typical human state to even

12821.52 --> 12826.800000000001
start to be able to comprehend how the

12823.92 --> 12828.64
hell this all works

12826.8 --> 12833.198999999999
and that's what I'm here to

12828.64 --> 12834.319
do and do my best to try to explain it

12833.199 --> 12838.08
as I

12834.319 --> 12840.359
go right and with that I'm rounding out

12838.08 --> 12841.88
so thanks everyone for coming I hope you

12840.359 --> 12844.439
