79.62 --> 86.36
[Music]

81.159 --> 88.84
sucks it's big gray soup all Dre as hell

86.36 --> 91.84
it's like raining

88.84 --> 91.84
continually

92.399 --> 96.04
kind of missed the dry weather

99.24 --> 103.15899999999999
yesterday so

103.479 --> 107.28
yeah one of those

108.079 --> 115.83999999999999
days it's not super cold

112.24 --> 118.83999999999999
though it's probably still like six or

115.84 --> 124.159
10 in between

118.84 --> 126.92
that right anyway it is Tuesday the 19th

124.159 --> 126.92
of December

132.2 --> 136.879
2023 temperature 8°

148.76 --> 153.67999999999998
right so thought let's start on time for

152.599 --> 157.2
a

153.68 --> 157.20000000000002
change how about

157.48 --> 161.879
that although that probably means a

159.84 --> 166.36
little bunch of people are not really

161.879 --> 166.35999999999999
going to be there the first half hour or

166.879 --> 171.84
so five watching that's

178.76 --> 181.76
something

183.319 --> 189.23899999999998
Paul Cook was supposed to show up for a

186.56 --> 192.2
stream but that should have started I

189.239 --> 195.159
don't know how long yeah should have

192.2 --> 198.28
started an hour ago but still not shown

195.159 --> 198.28
up so that was

198.36 --> 201.36
weird

201.879 --> 208.67999999999998
uh maybe he's

204.64 --> 211.67999999999998
having some morning issues like I

208.68 --> 211.68
am

214.72 --> 219.68
H hey Tommy first in chat good to see

220.0 --> 223.76
you how are you doing

238.68 --> 244.84
today

241.519 --> 244.84
what can I talk

251.56 --> 258.239
about I almost like kind of want to talk

254.159 --> 258.239
about Europe and what's going on here

262.24 --> 268.40000000000003
but it's hard to describe it properly

265.199 --> 268.40000000000003
hey LSG good to see

268.6 --> 271.6
you

277.639 --> 283.919
yeah I got Illuminati C on

280.8 --> 286.16
downstairs it's probably warmer there

283.919 --> 289.09
than it is here so I'm just kind of like

286.16 --> 291.03900000000004
leaving it there until I want to get

289.09 --> 295.11999999999995
[Music]

291.039 --> 295.95
it did I see the volcano in ic no what

295.12 --> 298.56
it erupted

295.95 --> 301.56
[Music]

298.56 --> 301.56
again

315.199 --> 318.88
oh

316.039 --> 321.199
wow what an

318.88 --> 322.6
imagery but we're going to see a lot of

321.199 --> 327.199
that on

322.6 --> 327.199
Infowars they always love to use volcano

328.479 --> 331.479
imagery

332.639 --> 340.96000000000004
jeez oh that looks

336.68 --> 345.84000000000003
astounding just a field of lava just

340.96 --> 345.84
marching over land this crazy

347.0 --> 350.0
sight

358.479 --> 362.08
huh

360.12 --> 366.039
I'll show some why

362.08 --> 366.039
not just the

371.68 --> 377.24
images some of the

375.08 --> 379.84
imagery

377.24 --> 381.599
right I mean anybody can do this

379.84 --> 384.599
themselves

381.599 --> 384.599
but

385.36 --> 391.36
damn it's pretty spectacular this is

388.8 --> 394.36
also yeah this must be really up

391.36 --> 394.36
close

394.44 --> 399.039
pictures but I mean this does look

409.84 --> 412.84
spectacular

413.08 --> 418.71999999999997
right although this one it it mostly

415.919 --> 420.31899999999996
seems to be like a lava eruption and not

418.72 --> 424.08000000000004
like an

420.319 --> 427.16
explosion like remember the 2010 volcano

424.08 --> 429.35999999999996
I think it was 2010 somewhere over there

427.16 --> 433.08000000000004
it was this one that was so that had

429.36 --> 436.56
this massive explosion and then like all

433.08 --> 439.919
airplanes had to shut down for days

436.56 --> 443.28000000000003
because of the smoke was so extreme that

439.919 --> 446.28
one it it doesn't seem to be like that

443.28 --> 446.28
one

447.919 --> 453.12
right otherwise i' probably have heard

450.56 --> 453.12
more about

453.8 --> 459.319
it

456.17 --> 459.319
[Music]

459.56 --> 464.639
h Hello verum

462.44 --> 467.8
inquiry I'm just going to call you

464.639 --> 469.56
inquiry because that word is not you

467.8 --> 473.24
can't pronounce that without breaking

469.56 --> 473.24
your jaw

474.36 --> 477.36
uh

477.56 --> 481.319
oh okay

499.639 --> 504.159
oh man it was a bit of a rough night was

502.159 --> 510.28
late I'm kind

504.159 --> 512.399
of surprised I even got up this in time

510.28 --> 516.959
cuz om Benjamin did his stream like two

512.399 --> 516.959
hours later than normal which is oh my

517.399 --> 521.68
God like please don't do that

523.0 --> 528.56
again was a great stream though so I did

525.72 --> 531.44
actually sit through the entire thing

528.56 --> 534.8389999999999
but yeah then it got

531.44 --> 534.839
late but I'm

538.2 --> 541.2
here

548.6 --> 556.0790000000001
right also apparently like

551.44 --> 558.72
yeah Sunday was kind of a messy stream

556.079 --> 562.04
it always is when that subject comes up

558.72 --> 562.0400000000001
every time like people go

563.56 --> 569.88
ballistic but yeah there was this like

567.079 --> 571.959
Adam also came in Adam mein

569.88 --> 573.4399999999999
and like in a really unexpected moment

571.959 --> 576.2399999999999
and he

573.44 --> 578.839
just like really caught me at a bad time

576.24 --> 582.2
and I kind of

578.839 --> 584.8000000000001
like I think I talked [ __ ] I don't even

582.2 --> 587.88
technically remember that moment because

584.8 --> 591.279
I was just kind of getting stressed out

587.88 --> 593.32
from just losing control over my chat as

591.279 --> 594.399
everybody was just going insane and I'm

593.32 --> 598.12
losing

594.399 --> 602.72
oversight but uh yeah we talked about

598.12 --> 605.839
it and it's it's just it's exactly what

602.72 --> 610.0790000000001
I typically would

605.839 --> 612.519
expect that he was agreeing it's just

610.079 --> 615.3599999999999
like yeah just the details of it yeah

612.519 --> 618.16
yeah I know

615.36 --> 622.24
that's I know the

618.16 --> 624.8389999999999
details it's just really tough to

622.24 --> 627.24
explain but the thing he was concerned

624.839 --> 629.8000000000001
about that I was doing wrong is like no

627.24 --> 633.8
I wasn't doing that wrong I I totally

629.8 --> 635.8389999999999
wasn't it's just every time oh gas

633.8 --> 639.16
doesn't have weights comes up like

635.839 --> 639.1600000000001
everybody just goes

639.639 --> 648.88
insane in a way it's weird it's almost

643.959 --> 652.2299999999999
like it's a flat Earth within Flat Earth

648.88 --> 653.399
it's not technically within within

652.23 --> 656.24
[Music]

653.399 --> 659.6
physics you enjoyed Sunday it was good

656.24 --> 661.5600000000001
learning yeah no it is

659.6 --> 664.5600000000001
except for the nut

661.56 --> 664.56
jobs

666.079 --> 672.04
right but it it like this what happened

669.76 --> 675.12
Sunday that's like the fourth or fifth

672.04 --> 677.48
time on this channel and every time it

675.12 --> 680.2
comes up this this crazy [ __ ] starts

677.48 --> 682.399
happening everybody like I I just have

680.2 --> 684.6
to get ready with the banhammer because

682.399 --> 688.12
people get as triggered about it it

684.6 --> 690.9590000000001
seems as like as bringing Flat Earth

688.12 --> 690.9590000000001
used to be in

691.56 --> 698.1199999999999
2016 it just like super activates

696.16 --> 703.36
people but they tend to just

698.12 --> 703.36
misunderstand it because it is very

703.72 --> 706.72
convoluted

712.279 --> 718.24
right there's not many other subjects

715.399 --> 720.959
that that like give that kind of

718.24 --> 720.9590000000001
response

723.04 --> 730.04
maybe the the moon signal rebounds idea

727.079 --> 733.4799999999999
that one was very triggering too but I

730.04 --> 733.48
mean not as much as

734.12 --> 741.519
this saying gas has no

737.199 --> 743.5999999999999
Mass really but it just registered and

741.519 --> 746.48
yeah it's not the same thing

743.6 --> 747.72
though you know what is mass what what

746.48 --> 750.36
is

747.72 --> 753.36
weight and when you ask that question

750.36 --> 757.32
somebody can't just give a singular

753.36 --> 760.839
answer unless they're already talking

757.32 --> 763.5600000000001
about something in which that mass or

760.839 --> 767.72
weight has a very specific technical

763.56 --> 769.76
context and in that case they would have

767.72 --> 773.9200000000001
to know

769.76 --> 775.36
exactly what Mass what weight was

773.92 --> 776.8
otherwise they would they would

775.36 --> 779.24
basically not understand what they're

776.8 --> 782.04
talking about they're going to to Talk

779.24 --> 782.04
technical

785.079 --> 790.88
see but if they don't then yeah asking

789.079 --> 792.8
somebody what is mass what is weight

790.88 --> 796.92
well then they would have to conjure a

792.8 --> 796.92
context for it in order to

797.32 --> 800.32
pick

803.48 --> 810.1990000000001
right but of course like I bring forth a

807.279 --> 813.88
subject then people make judgments about

810.199 --> 816.8
that and so when I ask then what is mass

813.88 --> 819.88
what is weight I basically ask it in

816.8 --> 823.4799999999999
context to the setup that I

819.88 --> 826.0
described for my demonstration my

823.48 --> 826.0
virtual

826.68 --> 831.16
demonstration but people don't really

828.839 --> 834.1600000000001
know weight and

831.16 --> 837.04
mass like if I ask all of you in the

834.16 --> 841.6
chat all of you all two of

837.04 --> 848.48
you like please please give

841.6 --> 848.48
me three different definitions of

853.279 --> 857.279
weight like are you going to be able to

856.079 --> 861.399
do

857.279 --> 861.399
that to actually say

865.839 --> 870.6800000000001
that I know Adam mein would

871.32 --> 876.9200000000001
and probably like

873.24 --> 882.8
uh refracted curvature John

876.92 --> 882.8
could Quantum eraser would could but he

886.24 --> 893.16
wouldn't I think Nathan Oakley could

890.36 --> 896.8000000000001
too can any of

893.16 --> 898.7199999999999
you Tommy after Sunday after everything

896.8 --> 903.639
that I explained could you give me the

898.72 --> 903.639
the three different definitions of

905.0 --> 912.839
weight doesn't have to be formul

907.519 --> 912.839
formulas or math or anything just rough

922.32 --> 927.12
description if anybody else listening

925.199 --> 930.5999999999999
hears this and it's like oh I can do

927.12 --> 930.6
that yeah then you can

930.839 --> 934.24
give your version

934.48 --> 938.6
too if you show up in the

945.279 --> 952.16
chat you think you could at

948.079 --> 952.16
Le okay we try

956.959 --> 962.56
it make for good title too by the way

959.68 --> 962.56
I'll put it in

969.26 --> 975.4
[Music]

976.759 --> 980.639
there I'll see where that

987.519 --> 990.519
goes

992.65 --> 999.3489999999999
[Music]

1010.36 --> 1015.6
come on somebody give an attempt I don't

1012.079 --> 1015.5999999999999
want to always just spoil

1017.48 --> 1022.44
everything

1020.04 --> 1027.839
you think about everything that has been

1022.44 --> 1027.839
discussed that I've explained about

1030.12 --> 1036.0
weight I mean I I could literally

1032.88 --> 1039.64
summarize it in one sentence in the

1036.0 --> 1043.28
chat the three

1039.64 --> 1047.4
weights now not the definition of

1043.28 --> 1050.24
weight smartass

1047.4 --> 1052.039
it

1050.24 --> 1054.76
[Music]

1052.039 --> 1054.76
not of

1056.44 --> 1062.24
postponing yes wait that's right wait

1059.96 --> 1062.24
not

1062.96 --> 1066.8400000000001
wait I mean it's in the

1066.99 --> 1075.69
[Music]

1077.4 --> 1080.4
title

1085.24 --> 1090.72
yeah I'm going to get my elatic I'll be

1087.559 --> 1094.799
right back like

1090.72 --> 1094.799
Einstein something

1095.84 --> 1098.84
what

1101.96 --> 1107.0
no what El what does electric have to do

1105.36 --> 1109.9189999999999
with

1107.0 --> 1113.12
weights I'm not talking about Feast of

1109.919 --> 1116.5200000000002
nonsense interpretation as what causes

1113.12 --> 1116.52
weight I'm talking about

1137.32 --> 1140.32
weight

1167.24 --> 1172.24
down

1169.84 --> 1175.039
all right so cheers look at how

1172.24 --> 1175.039
beautiful this thing

1175.84 --> 1178.84
is

1181.12 --> 1185.3999999999999
amazing I don't know I always F find

1183.799 --> 1187.96
there's something aesthetic about

1185.4 --> 1192.3200000000002
Illuminati

1187.96 --> 1192.32
croissance it just reminds me of a

1192.36 --> 1198.9599999999998
pyramid I mean if you kind of like look

1195.72 --> 1201.76
at it and have maximum imag ination like

1198.96 --> 1204.96
a little child then you could kind of

1201.76 --> 1210.1589999999999
think of it as looking like the

1204.96 --> 1210.159
pyramids Giza or something I don't

1211.039 --> 1214.679
know maybe I'm

1214.72 --> 1223.28
just a little bit isolated and starting

1218.36 --> 1223.28
to imprint my imagination on

1223.52 --> 1229.96
everything before you know it I'll start

1226.12 --> 1232.4799999999998
to draw a a face on a football and call

1229.96 --> 1232.48

1232.64 --> 1239.2800000000002
friend Super Chat me before I I go that

1236.12 --> 1241.4799999999998
far and with super chat I mean send me a

1239.28 --> 1244.6
PayPal don't actually Super Chat is not

1241.48 --> 1245.76
on and I don't get anything out of it if

1244.6 --> 1247.32
it were

1245.76 --> 1249.76
on

1247.32 --> 1250.9189999999999
anyway three definitions of weight come

1249.76 --> 1255.32
on

1250.919 --> 1259.039
guys you don't have to like have the

1255.32 --> 1263.12
perfect description the perfect word

1259.039 --> 1265.0
just the three describe it describe the

1263.12 --> 1268.9189999999999
three definitions of

1265.0 --> 1268.919
weight the the three

1272.52 --> 1278.44
versions and as far as I'm concerned

1275.279 --> 1280.48
like weight technically isn't even a

1278.44 --> 1284.159
part of like

1280.48 --> 1286.3600000000001
Einstein gravity or anything so that

1284.159 --> 1288.8400000000001
doesn't count like it doesn't even

1286.36 --> 1292.7199999999998
address it Newton did address

1288.84 --> 1297.36
it yeah and so that technically does

1292.72 --> 1301.72
count as one right the Newtonian weight

1297.36 --> 1305.4399999999998
is assumed to be the the inertia or the

1301.72 --> 1309.6000000000001
the mass that is being subjected to this

1305.44 --> 1311.96
elusive but everpresent force of gravity

1309.6 --> 1316.1589999999999
for which there never was a hypothesis

1311.96 --> 1318.919
claims by the person who thought it up

1316.159 --> 1321.5200000000002
Newton but that is technically a

1318.919 --> 1325.5590000000002
definition of

1321.52 --> 1328.12
weight it is the one that's nonsense and

1325.559 --> 1332.6399999999999
officially disclaimed but it's still

1328.12 --> 1335.7199999999998
thought of a lot formula is hard to get

1332.64 --> 1338.3600000000001
out of people's system because it is

1335.72 --> 1340.6000000000001
still being taught in schools at a young

1338.36 --> 1344.3999999999999
age and when you do that yeah it's going

1340.6 --> 1347.1999999999998
to be tough to get out what people learn

1344.4 --> 1348.799
young they have a lot of trouble

1347.2 --> 1351.159
actually

1348.799 --> 1354.48
unlearning it's very tough to unlearn

1351.159 --> 1354.48
what you learned when you were

1356.6 --> 1363.36
young that's why you should never teach

1359.44 --> 1363.3600000000001
children things that are technically

1370.88 --> 1377.4
wrong right unless you teach them and

1375.2 --> 1380.48
while you teach them you teach them how

1377.4 --> 1383.44
it is out dated and why and if that's

1380.48 --> 1385.76
too complicated then they're too young

1383.44 --> 1385.76
for

1386.44 --> 1391.0800000000002
that but you shouldn't teach them

1388.88 --> 1393.919
something that's wrong because you

1391.08 --> 1396.32
because it's too complicated for you to

1393.919 --> 1398.72
teach them how it is

1396.32 --> 1403.0
wrong doesn't mean you should just teach

1398.72 --> 1406.6000000000001
them as if it were right that's bad in

1403.0 --> 1408.6
my opinion anyway but anyway that's one

1406.6 --> 1412.32
version of gravity

1408.6 --> 1412.32
so what are the other two come on

1416.21 --> 1420.009
[Music]

1430.6 --> 1436.9599999999998
guys yeah nobody cares flatland balard

1434.76 --> 1438.919
I'm not asking you for your balard

1436.96 --> 1441.96
opinion about new ton and gravity and

1438.919 --> 1444.76
how great it is asking for the

1441.96 --> 1444.76
definitions of

1466.799 --> 1469.799
weight

1474.279 --> 1478.919
force of pressure exerted on

1479.72 --> 1487.039
no but that's that's not hyper

1492.88 --> 1497.7600000000002
nonspecific hello Richard G by the way

1495.2 --> 1500.799
no no I'm talking about more specific

1497.76 --> 1504.24
specifically the

1500.799 --> 1510.1589999999999
three versions of

1504.24 --> 1512.919
weight not the thing that that they all

1510.159 --> 1514.5590000000002
share I mean that's that's rough what

1512.919 --> 1516.679
you said is like yeah that's what they

1514.559 --> 1518.799
all share that's the the common trait

1516.679 --> 1522.159
they kind of all share I mean that's not

1518.799 --> 1522.1589999999999
what differentiates

1526.679 --> 1529.679
them

1533.6 --> 1537.1589999999999
you almost kind of tricked us

1539.799 --> 1548.1589999999999
there come on get Newtonian weight what

1544.0 --> 1548.159
are the other two come on

1553.15 --> 1556.38
[Music]

1556.679 --> 1559.679
guys

1561.64 --> 1567.2
and no you can't Google this the only

1565.24 --> 1569.159
way you could look this up is if you

1567.2 --> 1572.1200000000001
actually watched back my streams in

1569.159 --> 1572.1200000000001
which I talk about

1574.279 --> 1577.279
this

1578.72 --> 1584.1200000000001
no yeah that's the that's the new tonian

1581.919 --> 1585.5200000000002
version flat land thanks yeah there's

1584.12 --> 1589.6
two other

1585.52 --> 1589.6
versions that are very relevant

1612.679 --> 1618.0800000000002
no it does not have anything to do with

1614.72 --> 1621.72
SpaceTime I already said that Richard G

1618.08 --> 1624.52
I know you probably just came in but I

1621.72 --> 1626.96
mean dude if I was in the chat I would

1624.52 --> 1629.0
have already written

1626.96 --> 1633.3990000000001
it

1629.0 --> 1637.12
like perfectly down come on man come on

1633.399 --> 1639.399
guys do any of you pay

1637.12 --> 1642.6
attention I mean I've talked about this

1639.399 --> 1642.6
for like five

1646.52 --> 1649.52
times

1649.679 --> 1657.2
I told you not to Google it when you

1652.48 --> 1657.2
Google it you only get neonian horse

1659.0 --> 1667.72
crap I'm asking you based on what you

1663.72 --> 1672.96
learned watching my show when I talked

1667.72 --> 1672.96
about this five times over the last few

1676.519 --> 1679.519
years

1688.159 --> 1694.1200000000001
you can literally summarize the three

1690.519 --> 1698.279
versions with like One Singular word

1694.12 --> 1698.279
each it's not that

1699.48 --> 1705.3990000000001
difficult but I mean you're all getting

1702.12 --> 1706.4399999999998
these just so you know you are all

1705.399 --> 1708.039
getting

1706.44 --> 1711.559
these

1708.039 --> 1715.559
I'm sorry I like you but you

1711.559 --> 1719.039
suck you do you do suck you suck as

1715.559 --> 1721.96
students this is like a really easy

1719.039 --> 1724.96
test comparative like the subject's hard

1721.96 --> 1729.1200000000001
the test is really easy this is like the

1724.96 --> 1732.279
the most rudimentary grasp of the entire

1729.12 --> 1733.799
subject not the complicated details and

1732.279 --> 1736.24
and like oh how what's the difference

1733.799 --> 1738.039
how do you know no not that part just

1736.24 --> 1741.76
the absolute

1738.039 --> 1744.919
rudimentary basis for the entire subject

1741.76 --> 1750.039
are the three types which you can each

1744.919 --> 1752.3990000000001
summarize with One Singular word do it

1750.039 --> 1752.399
or

1764.96 --> 1769.32
[Music]

1766.32 --> 1769.32
suck

1776.64 --> 1784.2
and no you can't look this up anywhere

1778.64 --> 1784.2
you can't Google this you have to

1784.72 --> 1789.6000000000001
understand it's hard to not just

1787.039 --> 1789.6
remember the

1791.48 --> 1794.48
yelling

1795.519 --> 1799.32
wow yeah

1799.919 --> 1805.3600000000001
well maybe I'll just talk about it again

1802.24 --> 1808.279
and not get angry not even ban anybody

1805.36 --> 1811.559
and just let you all just puke it out in

1808.279 --> 1813.919
my chat and then you'll have trouble

1811.559 --> 1818.039
remembering because you were bickering

1813.919 --> 1818.039
with somebody else not because I was

1822.84 --> 1829.72
yelling not directly talking about you

1826.2 --> 1829.72
El I don't even know if you were

1831.76 --> 1835.64
there not here for that

1841.799 --> 1845.72
[ __ ] do you want to

1856.24 --> 1862.039
understand cuz I'm here to explain all

1859.76 --> 1864.24
these complicated things like that's

1862.039 --> 1867.559
kind of what I do I don't do it every

1864.24 --> 1871.679
day because I'd freaking get a

1867.559 --> 1874.48
meltdown too regular too

1871.679 --> 1877.519
regularly cuz everybody just keeps

1874.48 --> 1880.519
piling on and all that crap just I don't

1877.519 --> 1883.96
know man i' I'd literally have to be

1880.519 --> 1886.3990000000001
paid more like a lot more so that I

1883.96 --> 1888.799
could actually have some money to spend

1886.399 --> 1890.8799999999999
on like TR to fight off the medical

1888.799 --> 1893.559
issues that are going to build up if I

1890.88 --> 1897.6390000000001
actually did that every single

1893.559 --> 1901.16
day yeah but I don't get the finances so

1897.639 --> 1903.399
I'm definitely not going to risk

1901.16 --> 1906.76
[Music]

1903.399 --> 1910.9189999999999
that but I'd expect by now that people

1906.76 --> 1916.1589999999999
would at least be able to summarize with

1910.919 --> 1919.159
singular words the three versions of

1916.159 --> 1919.159
weight

1925.559 --> 1930.72
otherwise my conclusion is that none of

1927.76 --> 1933.12
you actually give a [ __ ] about my

1930.72 --> 1936.1200000000001
explanations at all that's my

1933.12 --> 1936.12
alternative

1938.12 --> 1942.399
conclusion and then I'm just like I'm

1940.559 --> 1944.519
just techn babbling I mean you could

1942.399 --> 1946.08
just as well be listening to witz it

1944.519 --> 1949.24
then

1946.08 --> 1951.519
right I mean what's stopping you from

1949.24 --> 1954.559
just listening to Wit It enjoying all

1951.519 --> 1958.08
that all you have to do is not think

1954.559 --> 1961.72
about Nathan explaining exactly why it's

1958.08 --> 1963.6789999999999
nonsense then what he talks about right

1961.72 --> 1965.88
CU if you don't have a reminder about

1963.679 --> 1967.72
that you can just comfortably listen to

1965.88 --> 1970.6000000000001
the Techno Babble and it'll sound

1967.72 --> 1972.679
amazing will be great to sit through are

1970.6 --> 1975.279
you going to learn anything from

1972.679 --> 1979.1200000000001
that well just as much as you apparently

1975.279 --> 1981.96
learn from me when I explain my non-

1979.12 --> 1984.32
technobabble things and like keep

1981.96 --> 1986.3990000000001
re-explaining it and re-explaining it

1984.32 --> 1990.12
and re-explaining it and re-explaining

1986.399 --> 1994.7199999999998
it I'd expect you to understand and

1990.12 --> 1994.7199999999998
remember the details at some

2005.96 --> 2011.8400000000001
point not everything you don't have to

2009.039 --> 2016.0
memorize every damn thing I've ever

2011.84 --> 2018.1999999999998
said but you have to get it how about

2016.0 --> 2020.08
you just get

2018.2 --> 2025.88
it that's

2020.08 --> 2025.8799999999999
something that will make it worth it at

2027.279 --> 2032.559
least three definitions of weight come

2029.88 --> 2035.96
on let's go one is already on the table

2032.559 --> 2038.799
Newtonian what are the other

2035.96 --> 2042.519
two or are you going to tell me I

2038.799 --> 2045.679
literally wasted all those

2042.519 --> 2047.88
hours and all that frustration trying to

2045.679 --> 2051.44
explain it over and over and over and

2047.88 --> 2056.76
over again for a CO combination of like

2051.44 --> 2056.76
10 hours or something was it all for

2065.879 --> 2068.879
nothing

2089.639 --> 2095.639
relative density this equilibrium

2092.56 --> 2097.56
that's fair enough it's not an answer

2095.639 --> 2099.4
though because that that's relative

2097.56 --> 2101.16
density dis equilibrium that's the

2099.4 --> 2104.44
actual thing the

2101.16 --> 2108.7599999999998
actual passive displacement

2104.44 --> 2112.7200000000003
Force it's not weight I mean

2108.76 --> 2115.2000000000003
technically it is weight but it's not

2112.72 --> 2119.3999999999996
like one of the versions of

2115.2 --> 2122.7999999999997
weight it's the actual thing that

2119.4 --> 2127.6800000000003
happens but there are three ways in

2122.8 --> 2130.48
which weight are used I want to know

2127.68 --> 2131.839
which three ways one's already on the

2130.48 --> 2134.44
table it's

2131.839 --> 2138.32
Newtonian what are the other

2134.44 --> 2143.04
two what are the other two ways in which

2138.32 --> 2145.52
you are familiar have heard of or use

2143.04 --> 2148.839
wait come on

2145.52 --> 2148.839
people wake

2155.8 --> 2158.8
up

2159.28 --> 2163.88
this is about the word about the use

2161.76 --> 2166.88
this is not about physics what is real

2163.88 --> 2169.7200000000003
what is not real this is about weight

2166.88 --> 2172.44
the word waight where have you come

2169.72 --> 2175.7999999999997
across that how do you use it how is it

2172.44 --> 2179.8
used what are the three versions of

2175.8 --> 2182.96
weight come on not what is real this is

2179.8 --> 2182.96
not what that's about this

2184.319 --> 2191.2799999999997
is naming name it what are the three

2189.28 --> 2194.52
definitions of weight what are they

2191.28 --> 2198.1600000000003
you're not going to be able to Google

2194.52 --> 2201.16
this but you will know if you actually

2198.16 --> 2204.839
listened to my streams where I talk

2201.16 --> 2208.56
about gas not having mask gas not having

2204.839 --> 2208.56
weight My Stream

2213.16 --> 2218.68
Sunday come

2215.68 --> 2218.68
on

2223.89 --> 2226.949
[Music]

2228.4 --> 2232.28
I'm not going to tell you I'm not going

2231.079 --> 2236.1600000000003
to tell

2232.28 --> 2239.5600000000004
you for weeks if necessary until

2236.16 --> 2243.319
somebody can gather their brain cells

2239.56 --> 2243.319
and answer the damn

2245.599 --> 2248.599
question

2274.92 --> 2278.599
buoyancy is not weight

2288.76 --> 2294.5200000000004
so is anybody going to make attempt or

2290.4 --> 2298.599
is everybody just going to name things

2294.52 --> 2303.52
that blatantly are not wait and do not

2298.599 --> 2305.52
have the word wait in them keep keep

2303.52 --> 2309.0
mentioning all these words that

2305.52 --> 2311.28
literally are not weight in an attempt

2309.0 --> 2314.64
to mention the three definitions of

2311.28 --> 2314.6400000000003
weight keep keep it

2314.76 --> 2321.6400000000003
up maybe just

2317.2 --> 2324.3999999999996
like go gas solid liquids if you think

2321.64 --> 2328.56
that's an answer no the three versions

2324.4 --> 2331.319
of weight not other things weight what

2328.56 --> 2334.24
are they three different

2331.319 --> 2335.52
weights things that have the word weight

2334.24 --> 2339.9599999999996
in

2335.52 --> 2343.56
them not other things weight related not

2339.96 --> 2346.52
other things okay is that

2343.56 --> 2351.599
clear not what causes it not what's

2346.52 --> 2356.04
happening not physics the use of the

2351.599 --> 2358.2000000000003
word how is it used how do we use weight

2356.04 --> 2361.839
there's three different versions of it

2358.2 --> 2365.68
that are not compatible and that I've

2361.839 --> 2367.16
been trying to explain for years now

2365.68 --> 2370.319
what are they

2367.16 --> 2373.48
we got neonian weight that's number one

2370.319 --> 2378.079
what are the other two how do you use

2373.48 --> 2378.079
weight where do you find the word

2379.88 --> 2386.48
wait no not it's nice try steamy

2383.839 --> 2386.48
traveler but

2387.319 --> 2392.04
that's that's act those have the word

2389.96 --> 2394.2400000000002
weight in it so fair

2392.04 --> 2397.119
enough but that wasn't actually the

2394.24 --> 2400.56
answer I'm looking for

2397.119 --> 2403.599
what is that what is what you just

2400.56 --> 2407.2799999999997
described air weight water weight what

2403.599 --> 2409.6400000000003
are they what is that steamy

2407.28 --> 2412.6400000000003
traveler how would that

2409.64 --> 2412.64
be

2419.8 --> 2427.38
described you're almost there actually

2423.16 --> 2429.04
thank you for doing your best

2427.38 --> 2431.2400000000002
[Music]

2429.04 --> 2433.839
but now air weight water weight I mean

2431.24 --> 2434.7599999999998
they're the same process just with

2433.839 --> 2437.44
different

2434.76 --> 2439.28
standards what what does that mean that

2437.44 --> 2442.68
weight that's hilarious at

2439.28 --> 2442.6800000000003
is almost

2443.76 --> 2449.6800000000003
there what is

2446.56 --> 2451.68
that what is air weight right what is

2449.68 --> 2453.5989999999997
water weight do air weight and water

2451.68 --> 2455.319
weight have anything to do with

2453.599 --> 2460.7200000000003
Newtonian

2455.319 --> 2464.16
mechanics no they do not what is it what

2460.72 --> 2464.16
is it when you do

2466.359 --> 2469.7999999999997
that both of

2485.24 --> 2488.24
them

2489.079 --> 2493.28
you guys are not going to find the word

2490.839 --> 2497.56
you're close enough Fair it's called

2493.28 --> 2500.88
conventional weight the convention of

2497.56 --> 2500.88
weight the

2501.68 --> 2508.2
metrics the me the convention of weight

2505.599 --> 2510.839
where you can literally like add things

2508.2 --> 2512.68
and like Define it with numbers that's

2510.839 --> 2517.7999999999997
the convention of

2512.68 --> 2521.48
weight yeah it's not physics related

2517.8 --> 2523.6800000000003
it's just what people do weighing stuff

2521.48 --> 2526.359
they use conventional

2523.68 --> 2529.8799999999997
weight yeah they don't use Newtonian

2526.359 --> 2529.88
mechanics when they do

2530.359 --> 2535.52
that they take a scale then they measure

2533.68 --> 2539.16
the

2535.52 --> 2540.92
pressure and that is translated into a

2539.16 --> 2544.1189999999997
numerical

2540.92 --> 2546.52
value it's the a Convention of weight

2544.119 --> 2549.119
right and the convention the normal

2546.52 --> 2551.0
weight convention is in air indeed and

2549.119 --> 2554.8
that's why you were halfway there steamy

2551.0 --> 2556.76
traveler right so there you go you got

2554.8 --> 2560.2000000000003
Newtonian

2556.76 --> 2563.6400000000003
weight you got conventional

2560.2 --> 2565.8799999999997
weight or you could even say colloquial

2563.64 --> 2570.44
weight because that's basically what it

2565.88 --> 2573.079
is it's the Practical used weight so

2570.44 --> 2575.64
it's not really defined it's just like

2573.079 --> 2576.88
how much pressure is this totally

2575.64 --> 2579.5989999999997
exerted

2576.88 --> 2583.4
and that is translated into a numerical

2579.599 --> 2585.7200000000003
value within the convention of weight

2583.4 --> 2587.76
yeah yeah air weight is conventional

2585.72 --> 2589.9599999999996
weight right but the others are

2587.76 --> 2594.0
basically the same thing they just are

2589.96 --> 2597.4
different slides they're different

2594.0 --> 2600.4
conventional ledgers you could say of

2597.4 --> 2603.44
the same conventional

2600.4 --> 2605.079
system it's the colloquial use of it

2603.44 --> 2607.839
you're going to use it

2605.079 --> 2610.6800000000003
colloquially right and things way

2607.839 --> 2614.359
differently in water as they do in air

2610.68 --> 2617.96
but how those numerical values are put

2614.359 --> 2620.64
down like the exact pressure result is

2617.96 --> 2623.76
technically the

2620.64 --> 2626.44
same so that numerical

2623.76 --> 2628.76
value is technically that's the amount

2626.44 --> 2630.52
of pressure it just becomes different

2628.76 --> 2632.119
when you weigh something in

2630.52 --> 2634.64
water

2632.119 --> 2636.92
right that's why it's the conventional

2634.64 --> 2639.96
weight now what's the third one guys

2636.92 --> 2642.319
come on the third weight what is the

2639.96 --> 2642.319
third

2644.96 --> 2650.839
weight I'll give you a

2647.839 --> 2650.839
hint

2656.359 --> 2660.16
chemistry I'm going to eat my

2665.0 --> 2669.28
Illuminati

2667.119 --> 2674.44
and turn on my

2669.28 --> 2677.48
coffee and you guys can spend this time

2674.44 --> 2677.48
guessing the third

2694.96 --> 2697.96
weight

2724.88 --> 2727.88
okay

2732.359 --> 2735.04
ah there you

2735.839 --> 2742.5589999999997
go waiting for dinner to be ready

2739.319 --> 2746.92
what what do you mean

2742.559 --> 2746.92
it's what do you mean dinner it's in the

2747.76 --> 2751.48
morning for you

2752.8 --> 2757.88
right or are you visiting Asia

2761.079 --> 2765.48
it's very funny thing yeah but okay you

2763.44 --> 2768.2000000000003
got it molecular weight there you go

2765.48 --> 2768.2
that's the third

2768.4 --> 2777.599
weight now none of you dare forget this

2774.48 --> 2779.48
okay I have to like almost humiliate you

2777.599 --> 2782.92
to get your attention like I don't want

2779.48 --> 2787.48
you to forget this you got to

2782.92 --> 2790.52
remember they're all completely

2787.48 --> 2793.4
different neonian

2790.52 --> 2797.16
weight conventional

2793.4 --> 2800.1600000000003
weight molecular weight

2797.16 --> 2800.16
completely

2801.119 --> 2805.52
different like totally

2812.04 --> 2816.96
different how do you we a molecule yeah

2815.319 --> 2820.48
that's the question question steamy

2816.96 --> 2824.599
traveler that's the whole thing well the

2820.48 --> 2824.599
trickiest part about it is

2825.48 --> 2830.359
that molecules have different

2830.8 --> 2839.2400000000002
states and the conventional

2834.76 --> 2842.119
weight of everything every material in

2839.24 --> 2844.72
in different states is

2842.119 --> 2849.119
different that alone like

2844.72 --> 2853.8799999999997
completely like annihilates the idea

2849.119 --> 2857.0
that molecular weight is related to

2853.88 --> 2863.52
Conventional weight it can't be because

2857.0 --> 2867.28
a molecule doesn't have a set amount of

2863.52 --> 2869.68
weight in any way because it can have

2867.28 --> 2869.6800000000003
different

2870.04 --> 2877.72
states and in a gaseous state it

2873.319 --> 2877.72
technically doesn't even have weight

2878.0 --> 2886.079
it might under conditions like if you

2881.16 --> 2888.839
pressurize gas in a tanker then because

2886.079 --> 2891.2000000000003
of the disequilibrium because it's more

2888.839 --> 2893.88
dense than the air that surrounds it

2891.2 --> 2896.319
it's going to weigh a little more it's

2893.88 --> 2898.559
going to register a little bit of

2896.319 --> 2901.92
conventional weight but that's very

2898.559 --> 2905.2000000000003
minute it's not going to be

2901.92 --> 2908.4
proportional to any molecular weight

2905.2 --> 2912.52
it's just going to be some

2908.4 --> 2915.88
weight but that amount the numerical

2912.52 --> 2919.839
value of that exact amount of excess

2915.88 --> 2923.079
weight is not going to like be

2919.839 --> 2926.0
useful to for example determine what

2923.079 --> 2931.2400000000002
kind of gas was put in

2926.0 --> 2931.24
there because you can't weigh

2932.24 --> 2941.4399999999996
gas it like it does it's it

2937.119 --> 2945.2000000000003
Elusive and so molecular weight you one

2941.44 --> 2946.88
can only conclude that it it has

2945.2 --> 2951.1189999999997
been

2946.88 --> 2953.48
measured by basically solidifying the

2951.119 --> 2957.119
materials or liquefying I don't know I

2953.48 --> 2960.2400000000002
think solidifying they solid solidify it

2957.119 --> 2962.2400000000002
and then they basically figure out its

2960.24 --> 2965.5989999999997
exact

2962.24 --> 2967.64
density and then calculate the weight

2965.599 --> 2970.76
based on

2967.64 --> 2973.2
that but you can't do that like if it's

2970.76 --> 2974.7990000000004
in a gaseous state so there are probably

2973.2 --> 2976.839
some

2974.799 --> 2979.839
materials

2976.839 --> 2980.96
which for like for example I can imagine

2979.839 --> 2984.68
that

2980.96 --> 2987.2400000000002
hydrogen can only be weighed in a liquid

2984.68 --> 2988.24
form because they can't get it to a

2987.24 --> 2990.5589999999997
solid

2988.24 --> 2994.52
state I don't know if that's true but

2990.559 --> 2997.52
maybe it is but I've never heard of like

2994.52 --> 2997.52
solid

2999.04 --> 3004.88
hydrogen right but I

3002.28 --> 3008.799
mean the point is is

3004.88 --> 3012.48
that they can't determine any kind of

3008.799 --> 3015.28
weight with a material in its gaseous

3012.48 --> 3018.48
state so they'd have to like cool it

3015.28 --> 3022.799
down pressurize it until it

3018.48 --> 3024.44
becomes liquid or solid and then they

3022.799 --> 3026.24
can have like a

3024.44 --> 3029.48
stable

3026.24 --> 3029.4799999999996
weight reading of

3030.799 --> 3036.44
it yeah molecular weight molecular MK

3034.0 --> 3039.839
yeah it's all the same

3036.44 --> 3039.839
Earthling it's the

3053.599 --> 3057.44
same right

3058.88 --> 3068.44
so if you pressurize gas in a gas

3064.2 --> 3068.4399999999996
tank and the gas tank is on the

3068.48 --> 3075.2400000000002
scale it's going to

3071.96 --> 3078.0
register extra weight on the

3075.24 --> 3079.64
scale but that amount of extra weight is

3078.0 --> 3084.24
not going to be

3079.64 --> 3087.359
proportional to the molecular weight of

3084.24 --> 3087.359
the material

3089.52 --> 3098.4
why because it's in there in a gaseous

3094.599 --> 3101.839
State and if that might cause some

3098.4 --> 3105.559
disequilibrium for the object the tanker

3101.839 --> 3108.839
and the gas combined versus the

3105.559 --> 3112.96
medium but it's not going to give a

3108.839 --> 3116.96
stable linear weight reading that is

3112.96 --> 3119.319
proportional to that material

3116.96 --> 3122.28
like as in the molecular weight or the

3119.319 --> 3123.44
molecular mass see and that's how it's

3122.28 --> 3125.4
completely

3123.44 --> 3128.76
different and people have a lot of

3125.4 --> 3128.76
trouble just keeping this

3130.64 --> 3137.16
straight that's why it's important to

3133.24 --> 3139.319
distinguish between the three different

3137.16 --> 3142.1189999999997
definitions of weight it's very

3139.319 --> 3147.2799999999997
important to keep them apart otherwise

3142.119 --> 3147.28
you get all tangled up in this mess

3150.079 --> 3157.88
can you get molecular weight more easily

3152.24 --> 3157.8799999999997
in a vacuum chamber no absolutely the

3167.119 --> 3176.48
opposite the vacuum doesn't assists

3171.76 --> 3180.119
with making material more solid or

3176.48 --> 3183.48
liquid it does the opposite low pressure

3180.119 --> 3185.2000000000003
actually causes material to transform

3183.48 --> 3188.839
the other way

3185.2 --> 3192.359
around so no vacuum definitely does not

3188.839 --> 3192.359
help with molecular

3195.44 --> 3200.96
weight what helps is being able to get

3198.599 --> 3203.7200000000003
control over the state over of a

3200.96 --> 3205.92
material in

3203.72 --> 3209.2799999999997
order to

3205.92 --> 3210.88
get a perfect ratio comparison to

3209.28 --> 3213.4
compare the

3210.88 --> 3215.359
weights right but it has to be stable it

3213.4 --> 3218.0
can't be in a gaseous State because then

3215.359 --> 3220.319
can expand and be compressed and every

3218.0 --> 3224.48
it's a

3220.319 --> 3227.44
mess it has to be stable liquid solid

3224.48 --> 3232.319
and then you can use the

3227.44 --> 3232.319
ratio system and compare it to something

3234.16 --> 3237.16
else

3245.599 --> 3251.839
that's what kind of hor [ __ ] is that

3248.839 --> 3251.839
Earth

3252.28 --> 3257.76
unbelievable where do you get that

3254.28 --> 3257.76
science fiction nonsense

3263.52 --> 3269.28
from what you're going to ionize a

3266.96 --> 3271.68
particle so you're going to heavily

3269.28 --> 3275.96
influence a particle send it

3271.68 --> 3278.72
somewhere and then with a magnetic

3275.96 --> 3282.92
field you

3278.72 --> 3285.04
find the mass of that particle that you

3282.92 --> 3287.88
so heavily

3285.04 --> 3290.88
influenced

3287.88 --> 3290.88
how

3291.88 --> 3296.04
[Music]

3293.48 --> 3297.96
dude this is not very good science

3296.04 --> 3300.2799999999997
fiction Earthling it makes no damn sense

3297.96 --> 3300.28
what you're

3307.58 --> 3310.63
[Music]

3324.0 --> 3327.0
saying

3329.4 --> 3334.039
besides what you're talking about that

3331.119 --> 3334.039
sounds more like

3334.2 --> 3339.839
inertia like making a thing move and

3337.0 --> 3339.839
then if it's going to

3348.16 --> 3355.64
bend interesting though so can you

3354.0 --> 3359.319
ionize

3355.64 --> 3359.319
non-magnetic particles

3361.2 --> 3368.68
then can you just ionize any type of

3365.079 --> 3371.3590000000004
material to make it become subjected to

3368.68 --> 3371.359
a magnetic

3373.559 --> 3378.2000000000003
field without a vacuum particles will

3376.28 --> 3381.3590000000004
travel yeah so it's all completely

3378.2 --> 3381.359
useless yes I

3383.92 --> 3391.16
know you don't need any of

3388.52 --> 3394.799
that pretty damn sure that's not how

3391.16 --> 3398.1189999999997
they established like atomic weight or

3394.799 --> 3398.119
atomic mass that

3399.319 --> 3402.64
way sounds

3413.88 --> 3416.88
ridiculous

3417.68 --> 3422.8799999999997
I mean seriously like how are you going

3420.599 --> 3426.96
to take like

3422.88 --> 3430.599
a like a this particle like what state

3426.96 --> 3433.16
is this particle even in like this idea

3430.599 --> 3435.76
that you're describing ionizing a

3433.16 --> 3437.68
particle bending it oh really so what if

3435.76 --> 3440.5200000000004
the particle is actually actually in a

3437.68 --> 3442.0789999999997
liquid state can you do it then or is

3440.52 --> 3444.92
that simply going to mean it's

3442.079 --> 3446.96
immediately going to dissipate as soon

3444.92 --> 3450.76
as it's subjected to the lower pressure

3446.96 --> 3452.64
of the vacuum chamber just going to so

3450.76 --> 3456.6400000000003
what do you mean deflection sounds like

3452.64 --> 3460.96
this only works with solid very sta

3456.64 --> 3462.7599999999998
solid material Earth thing so not the

3460.96 --> 3465.7200000000003
entire

3462.76 --> 3467.92
plora of chemical compounds that exist

3465.72 --> 3467.9199999999996
in

3470.319 --> 3477.079
nature cyron motion yeah he Ste yeah

3474.839 --> 3480.2799999999997
yeah Terry 306 good to see you steam

3477.079 --> 3480.28
trailer was there already of

3486.119 --> 3489.2200000000003
course I'm going to get my coffee be

3488.72 --> 3492.35

[Music]

3503.72 --> 3506.72
back

3565.97 --> 3569.799
[Music]

3567.319 --> 3569.799
and I'm

3574.68 --> 3579.9199999999996
back oh yeah by the way special thanks

3577.359 --> 3581.96
to YouTube for not freaking freezing all

3579.92 --> 3586.6800000000003
the damn

3581.96 --> 3589.28
time actually just showing it as is not

3586.68 --> 3591.24
having video stalling all of that

3589.28 --> 3593.76
nonsense like the last

3591.24 --> 3596.64
week very glad that's not happening

3593.76 --> 3596.6400000000003
today

3601.839 --> 3606.599
yeah okay Earth thing that's really cool

3603.839 --> 3609.68
now please keep your science fiction

3606.599 --> 3612.1600000000003
nonsense experiment

3609.68 --> 3613.64
experimentation out of my chat and keep

3612.16 --> 3615.839
it

3613.64 --> 3618.24
relevant I would need to know about your

3615.839 --> 3618.24
techno

Babel

3625.39 --> 3630.8799999999997
[Music]

3627.599 --> 3635.799
yeah we're talking about the Practical

3630.88 --> 3635.799
actual known used form of

3638.359 --> 3646.359
weight yeah nobody uses a cyclotron and

3642.359 --> 3649.119
nobody uses a vacuum chamber to weigh

3646.359 --> 3649.119
things

3649.68 --> 3653.0789999999997
yeah that's

3653.52 --> 3656.52
nonsense

3657.559 --> 3662.6800000000003
I mean there is vacuum weight as a

3660.4 --> 3663.799
convention but I mean that's technically

3662.68 --> 3667.7599999999998
not really

3663.799 --> 3671.4
used it's a theoretical convention one

3667.76 --> 3673.2000000000003
that's literally never used because why

3671.4 --> 3676.2000000000003
because it's extremely

3673.2 --> 3679.0
impractical and nobody ever needs to it

3676.2 --> 3683.319
was like yeah it's there in case we need

3679.0 --> 3686.44
to have a weight definition in space

3683.319 --> 3686.44
yeah that's cute

3687.76 --> 3694.849
nature poures a vacuum it's never

3691.76 --> 3694.849
[Music]

3697.53 --> 3702.599
[Music]

3698.88 --> 3702.599
natural keep going

3713.44 --> 3716.44
chers

3720.48 --> 3726.599
really scientists observe the influence

3722.92 --> 3726.599
on gravity of antimatter oh

3729.119 --> 3736.2000000000003
really

3731.48 --> 3736.2
so an unexpected new

3736.359 --> 3743.359
influence um does that mean that like

3741.559 --> 3747.279
the laboratory blew

3743.359 --> 3749.88
up I mean if antimatter suddenly has

3747.279 --> 3755.279
like an unexpected influence I mean

3749.88 --> 3755.279
that's like boom

3760.92 --> 3767.76
right right or is it all just nonsense I

3764.88 --> 3773.2400000000002
mean what the [ __ ] is this supposed

3767.76 --> 3773.2400000000002
antimatter it sounds like Star Trek hor

3773.359 --> 3776.359
[ __ ]

3777.52 --> 3781.7599999999998
I mean I'd like to see some actual

3779.4 --> 3784.44
evidence that it exists that's not a

3781.76 --> 3787.3590000000004
bunch of paper with [ __ ]

3784.44 --> 3790.48
math how about some actual evidence that

3787.359 --> 3794.92
it exists like a demonstration like hey

3790.48 --> 3797.7400000000002
this this is a thing it does something

3794.92 --> 3800.84
there's a before and an

3797.74 --> 3800.8399999999997
[Music]

3801.0 --> 3805.039
after instead of blah blah blah blah

3803.119 --> 3808.6400000000003
blah oh this and that oh we needing this

3805.039 --> 3810.92
oh yeah yeah that's cute now what's the

3808.64 --> 3813.52
demonstration prove to me that actually

3810.92 --> 3813.52
something is

3823.88 --> 3831.96
there I mean if antimatter is antimatter

3827.4 --> 3835.6800000000003
and it does what antimatter does then

3831.96 --> 3838.2
demonstrate it

3835.68 --> 3840.16
take the

3838.2 --> 3843.1189999999997
antimatter and

3840.16 --> 3848.3999999999996
then combine it with matter and have it

3843.119 --> 3850.44
all zoomed in and time sliced and up so

3848.4 --> 3852.96
that you can see that there something

3850.44 --> 3855.839
happening and somebody could actually

3852.96 --> 3858.44
like like have some kind of

3855.839 --> 3861.92
demonstration of like yeah antimatter

3858.44 --> 3864.2400000000002
actually is a thing see here see the

3861.92 --> 3867.2400000000002
matter reacting with the antimatter

3864.24 --> 3870.0789999999997
having a perfect neutralization with the

3867.24 --> 3873.4399999999996
unleashing of energy and this is the

3870.079 --> 3877.279
actual proof of it wouldn't that just be

3873.44 --> 3880.7200000000003
amazing actual proof for techno Babble

3877.279 --> 3882.92
horse [ __ ] from the top down for which

3880.72 --> 3884.8799999999997
you all pay billions wouldn't that be

3882.92 --> 3886.64
great if you actually had a real

3884.88 --> 3889.88
demonstration of these things instead of

3886.64 --> 3889.8799999999997
just a bunch of horseshit

3891.279 --> 3896.16
math you

3893.16 --> 3896.16
know

3897.27 --> 3900.44
[Music]

[Music]

3919.44 --> 3924.7200000000003
Newtonian gravity isn't what theoretical

3922.079 --> 3926.4
astrophysic role with today yeah because

3924.72 --> 3928.4399999999996
they just don't make any damn sense

3926.4 --> 3931.76
anymore and they they've

3928.44 --> 3934.44
gotten the plate they're they're

3931.76 --> 3937.0
just they're not really connected to

3934.44 --> 3938.7200000000003
anything real anymore they're just

3937.0 --> 3941.72
making it up as they

3938.72 --> 3941.72
go

3941.74 --> 3946.0389999999998
[Music]

3943.039 --> 3946.039
recombining

3946.4 --> 3954.359
right but I mean it there in the

3950.559 --> 3957.4
meantime Newtonian gravity is still

3954.359 --> 3960.799
avoidably involved whether there is a

3957.4 --> 3964.44
claim for it to be physics or not to be

3960.799 --> 3967.88
real or not is kind of irrelevant to the

3964.44 --> 3970.599
fact that Newtonian gravity is

3967.88 --> 3971.839
employed has been employed and Still

3970.599 --> 3977.559
Remains

3971.839 --> 3977.5589999999997
employed within the model of the solar

3979.079 --> 3985.96
system you know why because there is

3982.24 --> 3989.279
literally nothing

3985.96 --> 3992.64
else that has been conceived

3989.279 --> 3996.839
of that could replace

3992.64 --> 3998.72
it that's why they have nothing else to

3996.839 --> 4001.4
replace it

3998.72 --> 4003.4399999999996
with you know why because Einstein

4001.4 --> 4007.64
Gravity the supposed replacement it

4003.44 --> 4012.48
doesn't do anything it literally doesn't

4007.64 --> 4015.72
do anything you can't take stuff and

4012.48 --> 4019.48
then use Einstein and gravity to

4015.72 --> 4022.72
calculate how like how it is going to

4019.48 --> 4026.92
work because Einstein gravity

4022.72 --> 4031.9199999999996
technically doesn't do anything it

4026.92 --> 4035.2400000000002
only helps you describe

4031.92 --> 4036.76
things see it's not an acting Force it's

4035.24 --> 4039.7599999999998
more a

4036.76 --> 4039.76
descriptive

4040.76 --> 4047.119
thing so Einstein gravity literally can

4044.92 --> 4049.16
create the solar system it can't do

4047.119 --> 4052.319
anything the only thing Einstein

4049.16 --> 4054.7599999999998
gravity's even done in relation to the

4052.319 --> 4058.48
solar system

4054.76 --> 4060.4
is do some mathematical

4058.48 --> 4066.72
modifications on

4060.4 --> 4070.0
Mercury to get it to to prevent it from

4066.72 --> 4073.319
continually collapsing into the sun very

4070.0 --> 4077.119
quickly as is what EXA is what happens

4073.319 --> 4079.4
exactly that with the Newtonian model of

4077.119 --> 4082.079
the solar system it all works except

4079.4 --> 4087.119
Mercury always dies very quickly that

4082.079 --> 4090.2000000000003
was always the problem well they solved

4087.119 --> 4092.48
it with a cosmetic change of Einstein

4090.2 --> 4095.96
gravity that now supposed to explain why

4092.48 --> 4099.0
that doesn't happen that is it right but

4095.96 --> 4102.839
there is despite there being no claims

4099.0 --> 4105.239
for Newtonian gravity officially no no

4102.839 --> 4108.759
hypothesis it not being officially

4105.239 --> 4111.3589999999995
recognized anymore it's the only thing

4108.759 --> 4114.08
that exists

4111.359 --> 4118.52
currently that is

4114.08 --> 4119.839
usable to build this Solar System model

4118.52 --> 4125.279
like

4119.839 --> 4128.159
he had that thing it worked for that he

4125.279 --> 4131.1990000000005
could get it to fit except

4128.159 --> 4135.239
Mercury yeah there is no other thing

4131.199 --> 4138.48
that does that there's liter nothing no

4135.239 --> 4141.3589999999995
other mechanism that has taken its place

4138.48 --> 4144.3589999999995
in describing this

4141.359 --> 4144.359
heliocentric

4146.719 --> 4153.12
system of our solar

4149.199 --> 4155.5599999999995
system right so Newton is like outdated

4153.12 --> 4158.199
it's no longer claimed but they can't

4155.56 --> 4161.04
let it go because it's the only building

4158.199 --> 4162.4
block they have to create the solar

4161.04 --> 4164.2789999999995
system as it's

4162.4 --> 4166.5199999999995
working here's

4164.279 --> 4168.88
if you literally scrap Newton like a

4166.52 --> 4171.6
Mandela effect like out of existence

4168.88 --> 4174.04
it's like solar system

4171.6 --> 4176.64
yeah it literally wouldn't work there's

4174.04 --> 4178.5199999999995
nothing then then they wouldn't have

4176.64 --> 4180.319
anything to demonstrate it's just like

4178.52 --> 4182.6
yeah it's just lights going around each

4180.319 --> 4184.88
other and their

4182.6 --> 4187.759
bodies yeah yeah they just seem to move

4184.88 --> 4190.08
like that they wouldn't have like o this

4187.759 --> 4193.04
is how it's balancing and Mak sense with

4190.08 --> 4196.8
the gravity of Newton right because

4193.04 --> 4200.159
that's how the solar system was made to

4196.8 --> 4204.12
work like that and it kind of worked and

4200.159 --> 4207.0
it's like the only thing that kind of

4204.12 --> 4209.239
work even though it's not used anymore

4207.0 --> 4210.56
it's like it's outdated but they don't

4209.239 --> 4215.0
have anything

4210.56 --> 4217.679
else can you imagine that how crazy is

4215.0 --> 4220.52
that they're like dependent on an

4217.679 --> 4225.56
outdated

4220.52 --> 4228.96
toy for like a key component of their

4225.56 --> 4231.6
faith they can't discard it because

4228.96 --> 4233.92
there's nothing else to replace it

4231.6 --> 4233.92
that's

4237.719 --> 4244.64
amazing 5,000 x

4241.08 --> 4244.64
planets of course

4248.43 --> 4253.76
[Music]

4250.36 --> 4256.0
there hey D Rons good see you hope

4253.76 --> 4259.320000000001
you're all enjoying the show going to

4256.0 --> 4259.32
continue my Illuminati

4280.08 --> 4287.41
s oh J you have no idea how bad it is

4284.2 --> 4287.41
[Music]

4288.52 --> 4293.96
like if seriously if this all this money

4291.88 --> 4296.36
scam heliocentric nonsense keeps

4293.96 --> 4299.28
continuing there's going to be like

4296.36 --> 4302.239
entire research

4299.28 --> 4303.84
foundations that are literally going to

4302.239 --> 4309.678999999999
say

4303.84 --> 4312.56
like we are dedicated to discovering

4309.679 --> 4315.6
gravity okay

4312.56 --> 4317.88
literally that's that's what I said yeah

4315.6 --> 4323.56
discovering

4317.88 --> 4326.159000000001
it like they will never stop trying to

4323.56 --> 4327.96
figure out what gravity

4326.159 --> 4331.28
is

4327.96 --> 4332.2390000000005
never could be 200 years later and

4331.28 --> 4337.239
they'll

4332.239 --> 4340.239
still try to figure out what gravity

4337.239 --> 4340.239
is

4342.48 --> 4345.48
seriously

4372.44 --> 4375.44
C

4375.56 --> 4380.2390000000005
what no duper no you're messing

4383.52 --> 4391.56
up things in Newtonian mechanics things

4386.96 --> 4391.56
don't get Gravity by

4392.0 --> 4399.28
moving the force subject is

4395.639 --> 4403.2390000000005
subjected to the

4399.28 --> 4405.5599999999995
material and that's causing it to move

4403.239 --> 4407.799999999999
that that's how it's set not the other

4405.56 --> 4407.8
way

4432.36 --> 4435.36
around

4475.04 --> 4478.639
oh I was muted thanks for telling

4486.93 --> 4491.529
[Music]

4492.28 --> 4495.28
me

4499.07 --> 4506.04
[Music]

4520.96 --> 4526.199
hopefully they are working on figuring

4523.56 --> 4528.080000000001
out why gravity affects some things and

4526.199 --> 4530.719
not

4528.08 --> 4533.84
others well I

4530.719 --> 4536.4800000000005
mean according to NASA even like gravity

4533.84 --> 4536.4800000000005
is all really

4537.159 --> 4542.159
unpredictable like you can have pockets

4539.239 --> 4546.48
of gravity did have I mean this is kind

4542.159 --> 4549.719
of like nonsense on the side even for

4546.48 --> 4552.678999999999
them but they have been messing around

4549.719 --> 4554.36
like in on the ISS right where they're

4552.679 --> 4556.08
like yeah

4554.36 --> 4558.32
sometimes we have objects that are just

4556.08 --> 4561.5599999999995
floating around but other times there's

4558.32 --> 4564.32
an object like this C that just finds a

4561.56 --> 4566.679
pocket of gravity and then they just

4564.32 --> 4569.5599999999995
drop it to the ground and it's

4566.679 --> 4572.04
like they're going there they're really

4569.56 --> 4572.04
going

4575.159 --> 4580.48
there so yeah gravity is probably just

4578.56 --> 4583.1990000000005
an elusive mystery that they're just

4580.48 --> 4586.919999999999
going to keep on shoving in everybody's

4583.199 --> 4590.759999999999
face forever so wherever technological

4586.92 --> 4592.28
development is going to take us they're

4590.76 --> 4595.04
going to name it

4592.28 --> 4597.48
gravity whatever it is right whatever

4595.04 --> 4599.12
it's going to be some new thing and

4597.48 --> 4601.599999999999
they're just going to call it like

4599.12 --> 4603.5199999999995
quantum gravity tunnel blah blah blah

4601.6 --> 4606.159000000001
they have to put the freaking word

4603.52 --> 4606.159000000001
gravity in

4607.4 --> 4613.879999999999
there if I could bet money on this kind

4610.56 --> 4617.120000000001
of thing I would cuz I know no they will

4613.88 --> 4619.52
they do they always do this they have

4617.12 --> 4622.5599999999995
always done this they have done this in

4619.52 --> 4627.92
the last 100

4622.56 --> 4627.92
years I'm starting to like see a pattern

4631.639 --> 4639.8
there for indoctrination purposes only I

4635.719 --> 4639.8
that's amazing Richard thank you for

4639.89 --> 4645.0
[Music]

4642.0 --> 4645.0
that

4672.0 --> 4675.0
B

4712.76 --> 4718.400000000001
[ __ ]

4714.0 --> 4721.159
hell so yeah we don't need a University

4718.4 --> 4723.48
degree to get indoctrinated with a whole

4721.159 --> 4727.159
bunch of Superfluous

4723.48 --> 4729.799999999999
nonsense when you can just figure it

4727.159 --> 4730.759999999999
out you can figure out that gravity is

4729.8 --> 4735.0
hor

4730.76 --> 4737.12
[ __ ] it's a science fiction theme it's

4735.0 --> 4740.88
not even a thing it's a

4737.12 --> 4744.92
theme yeah specific gravity quantum

4740.88 --> 4747.56
gravity gravity gravitational waves it's

4744.92 --> 4751.36
all a

4747.56 --> 4753.4800000000005
theme none of it relates to a singular

4751.36 --> 4759.839999999999
thing gravity doesn't

4753.48 --> 4759.839999999999
exist it's a science fiction

4761.84 --> 4764.84
theme

4775.28 --> 4783.04
man bit of a runny nose today

4778.96 --> 4783.04
annoying I'm going to put that in the

4783.25 --> 4786.34
[Music]

4791.84 --> 4794.84
title

4800.42 --> 4803.47
[Music]

4809.9 --> 4813.0599999999995
[Applause]

4813.27 --> 4816.469
[Music]

4816.6 --> 4824.76
yeah definitely putting that in the

4819.44 --> 4824.759999999999
title today's a very productive day

4862.84 --> 4866.8
H okay

4864.56 --> 4871.360000000001
teret that's interesting that people

4866.8 --> 4871.360000000001
think that's fake finally figuring it

4879.0 --> 4884.08
out and I mean it's all pretty pointless

4881.56 --> 4888.4800000000005
too I mean it is like a bunch of

4884.08 --> 4891.239
clowning dude if I had control and I

4888.48 --> 4896.04
don't I'd like

4891.239 --> 4900.839999999999
completely organized like the ISS events

4896.04 --> 4904.12
completely different no more [ __ ] no

4900.84 --> 4907.04
more stupid CGI nonsense yeah leave it

4904.12 --> 4907.04
to the actual

4907.12 --> 4914.639
movies just leave it to the movies

4911.639 --> 4914.639
man

4919.0 --> 4923.08
if they want to do the ISS right you got

4921.96 --> 4928.88
to

4923.08 --> 4928.88
make it secondary in a

4929.36 --> 4936.32
way right I mean you don't have to do

4933.199 --> 4939.678999999999
like a twirly Trill or have some stupid

4936.32 --> 4942.199
water bubbles floating around to try to

4939.679 --> 4946.08
convince people that it's space all you

4942.199 --> 4947.799999999999
need to do is just hang there and it

4946.08 --> 4949.84
would be pretty cool if it was a little

4947.8 --> 4952.92
bit more Dynamic and you could actually

4949.84 --> 4955.360000000001
like float from side to side and all

4952.92 --> 4957.76
that like if you could like push if you

4955.36 --> 4960.28
could get like a suspension wire system

4957.76 --> 4961.76
going on where instead yeah it would be

4960.28 --> 4963.36
difficult with multiple people or with

4961.76 --> 4966.04
one individual where they could

4963.36 --> 4969.839999999999
literally like push themselves off the

4966.04 --> 4973.48
side and the bottom of the ISS if they

4969.84 --> 4976.08
could do that that would be like a

4973.48 --> 4978.599999999999
thousand times more convincing than the

4976.08 --> 4980.639
hor [ __ ] games that they play

4978.6 --> 4984.8
now

4980.639 --> 4984.8
seriously I could organize

4985.56 --> 4990.639
that but they don't care otherwise they

4988.28 --> 4992.88
would have already done that like 30

4990.639 --> 4992.88
years

4998.43 --> 5003.2390000000005
[Music]

4999.84 --> 5005.04
ago yes terrett I know I know they still

5003.239 --> 5009.0
use the

5005.04 --> 5012.5199999999995
formula but they don't have a

5009.0 --> 5016.44
justification for using that

5012.52 --> 5019.76
formula see teret it's like yeah we're

5016.44 --> 5023.199
going to give you the Newtonian G like

5019.76 --> 5023.1990000000005
yeah but there's no claim for

5026.44 --> 5034.44
that yeah yeah we know stutter stutter

5030.84 --> 5035.96
you don't know why yeah

5034.44 --> 5038.638999999999
because there's nothing

5035.96 --> 5042.44
else there's no claim for it being

5038.639 --> 5044.639
scientific though it's not used but it's

5042.44 --> 5048.0
still used you know they still use it

5044.639 --> 5051.4800000000005
but just like don't talk about it they

5048.0 --> 5053.88
don't want to know how their toy that

5051.48 --> 5056.48
they the only way they can play their

5053.88 --> 5058.36
game is using the old toy even though

5056.48 --> 5061.32
they're not supposed to use it anymore

5058.36 --> 5063.0
but they don't know how to do it without

5061.32 --> 5066.4
it right so

5063.0 --> 5066.4
it's very embarrassing for

5068.4 --> 5074.199
them like yeah we still use Newtonian

5071.48 --> 5077.5199999999995
mechanics to calculate the gravity

5074.199 --> 5081.04
amount of weight you have on other

5077.52 --> 5083.159000000001
planets like yeah but there's no

5081.04 --> 5085.76
hypothesis for

5083.159 --> 5088.759999999999
gravitation you never claimed

5085.76 --> 5091.0
it it's it's officially

5088.76 --> 5092.96
disclaimed why are you still using

5091.0 --> 5096.199
Newtonian mechanics to calculate

5092.96 --> 5096.199
people's weight on other

5097.679 --> 5101.4800000000005
planets you know how that

5115.45 --> 5119.34
[Music]

5121.28 --> 5124.28
goes

5133.159 --> 5138.879999999999
the next one is going to be what are you

5135.84 --> 5138.88
talking about

5151.28 --> 5154.28
Tommy

5171.76 --> 5178.56
they can change anything as and they

5175.36 --> 5178.5599999999995
yeah but ter I

5181.199 --> 5186.599999999999
mean they're going to unroll a new

5183.76 --> 5187.76
project yeah it I mean why the hell

5186.6 --> 5190.1990000000005
would they

5187.76 --> 5193.04
even at this point why they would they

5190.199 --> 5196.0
even use

5193.04 --> 5197.6
humans right I mean they're probably

5196.0 --> 5199.719
just waiting to the point where they

5197.6 --> 5202.6
could literally scan

5199.719 --> 5204.4800000000005
people and then make CGI models out of

5202.6 --> 5208.04
them so accurately you wouldn't be able

5204.48 --> 5210.839999999999
to tell that it's CGI they get to that

5208.04 --> 5213.4
stage then making any kind of space

5210.84 --> 5215.96
[ __ ] is going to be very

5213.4 --> 5219.839999999999
easy cuzz then they could just live

5215.96 --> 5223.4
render it all no glitches of like all

5219.84 --> 5225.52
overlapping the actual actual video with

5223.4 --> 5229.199
CGI which is going to be messy is going

5225.52 --> 5231.8
to give the glitch nonsense [ __ ] right

5229.199 --> 5233.44
practical errors it's more difficult if

5231.8 --> 5237.1990000000005
it's all

5233.44 --> 5241.08
CGI it's much easier right and that'll

5237.199 --> 5241.08
be much closer to like movie

5241.119 --> 5245.719
quality ever been to dis yes I've been

5243.6 --> 5248.52
to Discord and not to Tik Tok Tik Tok

5245.719 --> 5248.52
can go screw

5253.32 --> 5257.84
itself I like to hang around Rumble a

5258.46 --> 5262.92
[Music]

5260.36 --> 5266.679
bit don't particularly like to hang

5262.92 --> 5269.639
around Discord but I mean it is a place

5266.679 --> 5271.92
where there are flat earthers

5269.639 --> 5274.119
around and it's like the way to get on

5271.92 --> 5274.119
both

5278.56 --> 5282.679
Busters no one brought up the dialectric

5280.96 --> 5286.119
downward by yeah of course they didn't

5282.679 --> 5286.119
fiber outs because it's

5287.199 --> 5290.879999999999
nonsense it's not really

5296.44 --> 5300.04
relevant hello by the

5301.04 --> 5304.04
way

5320.56 --> 5323.84
what it your fired

5331.0 --> 5334.0
what

5338.08 --> 5340.96
I'm not following

5360.92 --> 5363.92
here

5364.8 --> 5371.4800000000005
why not Tik Tok because it's because I'm

5368.36 --> 5371.48
European it's all

5371.6 --> 5377.4400000000005
[ __ ] it's just a bunch of shorts anyway

5374.56 --> 5379.719
I mean

5377.44 --> 5382.199
really I don't want

5379.719 --> 5384.44
to what am I going to do there like I'm

5382.199 --> 5386.678999999999
a flat earther flat earthers can go

5384.44 --> 5389.919999999999
screw themselves in China

5386.679 --> 5394.679
to right who owns

5389.92 --> 5394.679
it what the hell would I want with Tik

5396.84 --> 5403.76
Tok right the only reason anybody ever

5401.08 --> 5406.44
here even brings up oh maybe this

5403.76 --> 5409.2390000000005
platform oh maybe there you could get

5406.44 --> 5412.759999999999
famous you won't be cracked down oh

5409.239 --> 5414.4
really no every platform that is popular

5412.76 --> 5416.360000000001
in any way you're going to be cracked

5414.4 --> 5419.08
down algorithmically for being a flat

5416.36 --> 5422.839999999999
earther that's a

5419.08 --> 5425.6
fact you would have to have like a

5422.84 --> 5431.32
social media platform that is

5425.6 --> 5431.320000000001
specific to Flat earthers to not have

5433.119 --> 5437.599999999999
that so yeah wherever am I like oh on

5436.119 --> 5438.759999999999
YouTube they're cracking down here yeah

5437.6 --> 5440.119000000001
what if I'm going to go to rumble

5438.76 --> 5441.4800000000005
they're going to do exactly the same

5440.119 --> 5442.92
thing if I'm going to go to Tik Tok

5441.48 --> 5446.718999999999
they're going to do exactly the same

5442.92 --> 5448.88
thing if I'm going to go to any other

5446.719 --> 5450.84
place they're going to do exactly the

5448.88 --> 5455.36
same

5450.84 --> 5459.1990000000005
thing cuz they don't like flat earthers

5455.36 --> 5461.119
unless they are blatantly

5459.199 --> 5462.919999999999
[ __ ] then you'll get all the

5461.119 --> 5465.119
attention right because that's the thing

5462.92 --> 5468.0
that they want everybody to

5465.119 --> 5471.799999999999
see right they don't want to

5468.0 --> 5472.88
see regular dumbass people that are into

5471.8 --> 5477.84
this

5472.88 --> 5480.4400000000005
system behold competent flat earthers

5477.84 --> 5482.2390000000005
they just don't want to have them see

5480.44 --> 5483.879999999999
anything flat earth related but if

5482.239 --> 5486.759999999999
they're going to see anything Flat Earth

5483.88 --> 5490.04
lat let it be some stupid

5486.76 --> 5493.0
loudmouthed barely comprehensible [ __ ]

5490.04 --> 5496.0
that gets over excited and

5493.0 --> 5499.119
doesn't like intellectually amount to

5496.0 --> 5502.44
anything or even have a good point and

5499.119 --> 5505.48
then they'll show that right that's why

5502.44 --> 5507.159
those [ __ ] flat earthers get popular

5505.48 --> 5510.44
because they're [ __ ] and when

5507.159 --> 5512.4
they're [ __ ] that's when it's okay

5510.44 --> 5514.799999999999
to show it to

5512.4 --> 5516.799999999999
everybody so that everybody can have

5514.8 --> 5518.96
that conditioning like oh Flat Earth oh

5516.8 --> 5521.320000000001
yeah [ __ ] oh yeah yeah yeah makes

5518.96 --> 5523.199
sense yeah that's what that's there for

5521.32 --> 5525.48
that's why you get

5523.199 --> 5526.839999999999
popular yeah that's why you get popular

5525.48 --> 5528.799999999999
as a flat earther because you're a

5526.84 --> 5532.56
[ __ ]

5528.8 --> 5532.56
[ __ ] that's when you get

5534.76 --> 5541.76
promoted cuz they want everyone to see

5538.4 --> 5544.159
that retardation and specifically as

5541.76 --> 5549.400000000001
associated with flat Earth so if you're

5544.159 --> 5552.199
a [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] antisocial

5549.4 --> 5554.159
scumbag that's just talking [ __ ] as long

5552.199 --> 5556.119
as you say Flat Earth in between you'll

5554.159 --> 5559.679
get the spotlight

5556.119 --> 5562.32
man you'll like you could be like

5559.679 --> 5566.1990000000005
literal 60 IQ you will get that

5562.32 --> 5566.199
Spotlight you will get millions of

5566.28 --> 5572.96
subscribers because you're a like

5569.679 --> 5577.08
horrendous person and you're into Flat

5572.96 --> 5581.8
Earth and so everybody in the world that

5577.08 --> 5584.96
owns a social media wants their crowd of

5581.8 --> 5589.28
indoctrinated people to see that so that

5584.96 --> 5593.119
they will associate flat earther with

5589.28 --> 5597.639
like white trash or black trash whatever

5593.119 --> 5599.5199999999995
trashy incompetent [ __ ] human that's

5597.639 --> 5601.88
the association they want with flat

5599.52 --> 5605.56
Earth that's why those flat earthers at

5601.88 --> 5608.2390000000005
the top of the line they score big yeah

5605.56 --> 5611.0
not because they're good it's because

5608.239 --> 5611.0
they're

5614.84 --> 5621.0
rarded and it's

5617.96 --> 5625.28
everywhere it is everywhere on the

5621.0 --> 5628.719
internet there is no exception only like

5625.28 --> 5630.5599999999995
micro platforms of individuals that are

5628.719 --> 5632.639
not part of a big

5630.56 --> 5635.4800000000005
system

5632.639 --> 5635.4800000000005
that's where it's not

5642.04 --> 5651.28
happening yes I know teret I know it's

5646.32 --> 5656.28
the full function yeah those retards get

5651.28 --> 5658.92
rich just so the elite could help

5656.28 --> 5660.639
demotivate the masses from getting into

5658.92 --> 5663.84
Flat Earth because they just don't want

5660.639 --> 5668.679
to be seen as a person that is that

5663.84 --> 5668.679
[ __ ] that's exactly what's

5672.679 --> 5677.32
happening yeah that's right slowo moon

5674.96 --> 5680.44
buggy true Earth

5677.32 --> 5682.759999999999
absolutely that's why it's called free

5680.44 --> 5685.599999999999
range controlled

5682.76 --> 5687.4400000000005
opposition feista nonsense it's free

5685.6 --> 5690.280000000001
range it's a controll

5687.44 --> 5695.119
opposition but it's

5690.28 --> 5699.5599999999995
Grassroots the people themselves rise to

5695.119 --> 5701.92
meet the market need of a controlled

5699.56 --> 5704.84
opposition right they get

5701.92 --> 5707.04
paid for fulfilling that

5704.84 --> 5711.04
role

5707.04 --> 5713.84
automatically free range controlled

5711.04 --> 5715.199
opposition Feast the nonsense that's

5713.84 --> 5717.08
what they do with us that's what they do

5715.199 --> 5719.4
with flat earthers all you have to do is

5717.08 --> 5722.08
be trendy be

5719.4 --> 5723.5599999999995
[ __ ] be relat

5722.08 --> 5727.04
with absolute

5723.56 --> 5729.52
morons and you'll get all the super

5727.04 --> 5732.159
chats and all the subs and the views in

5729.52 --> 5735.400000000001
the world you get them

5732.159 --> 5737.36
all cuz that's what they want all those

5735.4 --> 5742.08
people to

5737.36 --> 5742.08
see people that are

5742.119 --> 5745.92
[ __ ] and into Flat

5750.4 --> 5753.4
Earth

5753.679 --> 5758.92
right especially if they can line them

5755.52 --> 5762.96
up with like a really smooth goodlook

5758.92 --> 5766.32
well spoken like super well spoken

5762.96 --> 5769.04
culturally enriched like with the Deep

5766.32 --> 5772.0
knowledge background well way of

5769.04 --> 5774.44
speaking like a baller right next to it

5772.0 --> 5777.04
who won't even get into the arguments

5774.44 --> 5780.5199999999995
but will just be really sensible in

5777.04 --> 5782.639
comparison right that's even better a

5780.52 --> 5785.159000000001
baller that's just like a guy that

5782.639 --> 5787.28
really doesn't is not that defensive as

5785.159 --> 5790.32
the ball he just super reasonable and

5787.28 --> 5792.92
handsome and well spoken just having a

5790.32 --> 5795.04
conversation with a [ __ ] [ __ ] Flat

5792.92 --> 5798.119
Earth that just can't stop cursing for

5795.04 --> 5799.76
no damn reason is like blatantly like on

5798.119 --> 5802.239
meth or

5799.76 --> 5805.320000000001
something and just talk about conspiracy

5802.239 --> 5807.4
of the ball man talk like a complete

5805.32 --> 5809.88
idiot and just have that reasonable guy

5807.4 --> 5812.48
sit there like yeah but don't worry so

5809.88 --> 5814.0
much about it man

5812.48 --> 5818.718999999999
like

5814.0 --> 5821.719
yeah billion views billion

5818.719 --> 5821.719
billion

5822.08 --> 5829.04
views

5824.76 --> 5829.04
yeah you know that's what they

5833.54 --> 5836.6
[Music]

5840.199 --> 5844.159
want

5842.48 --> 5846.36
who was speaking like wit no it's the

5844.159 --> 5850.28
other way around wit it talks like Ken

5846.36 --> 5853.28
wheeler Ken wheeler invented it

5850.28 --> 5856.199
terrett Ken wheeler invented that

5853.28 --> 5858.5599999999995
specific form of technobo it's called

5856.199 --> 5862.04
the wheelie for a reason yeah it's

5858.56 --> 5865.360000000001
somebody doing a wheelie think of

5862.04 --> 5868.56
like a guy on a bike on the back of his

5865.36 --> 5871.0
wheel right doing a wheelie it's a trick

5868.56 --> 5873.320000000001
it's something to Captivate you it draws

5871.0 --> 5875.76
the attention doing a wheelie yeah it

5873.32 --> 5879.28
had absolute fractal implications when I

5875.76 --> 5881.400000000001
called it that doing a wheelie but

5879.28 --> 5884.36
that's what it is it's a scatter gunning

5881.4 --> 5886.4
wheel of techno Babble one thing after

5884.36 --> 5888.759999999999
another it seems to fit it seems to fit

5886.4 --> 5891.08
it seems to fit it seems to fit yet you

5888.76 --> 5893.96
never reach the end you just go around

5891.08 --> 5898.239
in a wheel in a

5893.96 --> 5901.44
wheelie can wheeler invented

5898.239 --> 5903.04
that he's the one that built that

5901.44 --> 5904.799999999999
discipline where you can just have one

5903.04 --> 5906.8
stepping stone after the other the other

5904.8 --> 5907.84
the other you can just keep going and

5906.8 --> 5912.679
keep

5907.84 --> 5916.2390000000005
going that's what Ken wheeler taught

5912.679 --> 5918.4800000000005
everybody is what he taught

5916.239 --> 5920.48
to Bob

5918.48 --> 5924.119
noell what wit

5920.48 --> 5926.5599999999995
it drained himself in like a lot like

5924.119 --> 5929.0
wit's like really taught himself the

5926.56 --> 5932.56
wheelie like he's mastered it he knows

5929.0 --> 5935.76
how to do it you can argue that Whit

5932.56 --> 5937.719
knows how to perform a wheelie better

5935.76 --> 5940.280000000001
than Ken wheeler at this

5937.719 --> 5943.44
point but I mean Ken wheeler did invent

5940.28 --> 5943.44
it it's his

5944.36 --> 5947.92
trick it's his

5949.679 --> 5956.4800000000005
method super [ __ ] audience yeah sure

5954.159 --> 5956.48
I don't

5957.04 --> 5966.08
know that's the crowd I'm referring to

5960.76 --> 5966.08
te Bist eat them up their tsunami

5966.96 --> 5971.52
gravies yeah I guess there's like a big

5969.4 --> 5975.44
market for techn Babble for people that

5971.52 --> 5978.080000000001
are [ __ ] but reasonably

5975.44 --> 5979.08
knowledgeable with words that want to

5978.08 --> 5982.199
feel

5979.08 --> 5984.639
smart despite them being provably

5982.199 --> 5987.638999999999
[ __ ] by their own

5984.639 --> 5987.639
actions

5990.04 --> 5993.04
yeah

5995.56 --> 5998.2390000000005
this for is

5998.56 --> 6004.159000000001
tto

6000.32 --> 6006.239
what did did he are those tattoos

6004.159 --> 6008.5199999999995
actually the formulas of his nonsense

6006.239 --> 6012.0
are you sure about that cuz he's like

6008.52 --> 6015.0
full of like freaky occultic

6012.0 --> 6018.0
symbols I didn't know he also had like

6015.0 --> 6020.719
formulas of his own nonsense that's

6018.0 --> 6022.92
crazy Jesus could you imagine like

6020.719 --> 6025.04
making up a theory and then tattooing it

6022.92 --> 6030.56
on your own

6025.04 --> 6034.96
damn that's like me like tattooing this

6030.56 --> 6036.679
symbol on my chest or something or my

6034.96 --> 6038.2390000000005
back I mean it would be pretty cool but

6036.679 --> 6041.2390000000005
it's like yeah I made it now I'm going

6038.239 --> 6043.48
to tattoo that but to do that with your

6041.239 --> 6047.159
ideas like

6043.48 --> 6049.08
damn like you have to be really certain

6047.159 --> 6052.92
you're

6049.08 --> 6052.92
right oh my God

6053.8 --> 6058.1990000000005
Canadian Mikey Smith I never heard of

6055.76 --> 6058.1990000000005
him

6061.48 --> 6067.879999999999
steamy telescope manufacturer Expos

6064.32 --> 6067.88
their images

6069.0 --> 6075.159
okay I haven't heard of

6072.52 --> 6076.88
him do you have like a channel link or

6075.159 --> 6082.629999999999
something might be interesting to take a

6076.88 --> 6086.439
look at or pass on to Fed

6082.63 --> 6086.439
[Music]

6094.41 --> 6097.6089999999995
[Music]

6100.85 --> 6103.9890000000005
[Music]

6108.56 --> 6112.84
[Music]

6109.84 --> 6112.84
Maybe

6117.54 --> 6120.569
[Music]

6135.88 --> 6142.76
[Music]

6139.76 --> 6142.76
e

6169.76 --> 6172.76
ah

6192.73 --> 6195.8099999999995
[Music]

6199.679 --> 6202.679
for

6214.719 --> 6219.4
so can we go through the three

6216.599 --> 6221.2390000000005
definitions of weight again before we

6219.4 --> 6223.879999999999
end the

6221.239 --> 6227.28
show I'd like to see that you actually

6223.88 --> 6232.159000000001
all remembered it now so if I bring it

6227.28 --> 6235.84
up again and I ask the question

6232.159 --> 6237.679
that people will actually be capable of

6235.84 --> 6239.84
giving the

6237.679 --> 6242.0
answer oh by the way I think I pissed

6239.84 --> 6242.0
off

6242.56 --> 6247.639
LSG at the beginning of the show sorry

6245.119 --> 6247.639
about that

6250.4 --> 6256.04
dude because I call called everybody an

6253.239 --> 6257.159
idiot and but he was there in the chat

6256.04 --> 6259.599
at the

6257.159 --> 6261.799999999999
time it wasn't meant

6259.599 --> 6263.96
personal

6261.8 --> 6265.119000000001
but like I mean I really want everybody

6263.96 --> 6268.32
to get it

6265.119 --> 6270.639
though ah it you yeah you got it that

6268.32 --> 6270.639
there you

6271.0 --> 6277.96
go perfect Newtonian conventional

6274.679 --> 6280.96
molecular you got it

6277.96 --> 6280.96
dude

6289.56 --> 6296.4800000000005
A+ right and so important to keep those

6293.119 --> 6299.119
three separate like Newtonian

6296.48 --> 6302.959999999999
conventional molecular just look at the

6299.119 --> 6305.159
words look at how they're all

6302.96 --> 6309.04
completely

6305.159 --> 6312.4
different they're like sort of the same

6309.04 --> 6314.96
idea roughly but practically they're

6312.4 --> 6317.598999999999
completely different and it's so

6314.96 --> 6320.199
important to keep that in mind every

6317.599 --> 6321.32
time you hear the word wait it's like

6320.199 --> 6323.48
wait

6321.32 --> 6327.159
whenever you hear the word wait you have

6323.48 --> 6330.0
to wait and think what kind of weight

6327.159 --> 6330.0
are we talking

6331.159 --> 6337.44
about so whenever you hear the word wait

6335.159 --> 6340.36
wait and ask the question what kind of

6337.44 --> 6340.36
weight are we talking

6342.599 --> 6346.719
about you're all good I glad to

6349.48 --> 6352.48
hear

6355.6 --> 6359.679
[Music]

6358.04 --> 6362.04
all right so today's turned out to be

6359.679 --> 6362.04
pretty good

6364.239 --> 6367.239
show

6379.4 --> 6382.4
this

6388.87 --> 6394.039
[Music]

6396.679 --> 6400.4
all right so yeah in a way I hope you

6398.96 --> 6403.2390000000005
guys remember it because it's going to

6400.4 --> 6405.4
be part of that exam that exam that's

6403.239 --> 6407.959999999999
not going to be

6405.4 --> 6412.119
official and you could have like a

6407.96 --> 6416.4800000000005
surprise quiz on this at any moment of

6412.119 --> 6418.759999999999
any of this during your entire life it

6416.48 --> 6420.799999999999
will never get

6418.76 --> 6424.08
you a

6420.8 --> 6427.719
job but it will potentially get you

6424.08 --> 6430.599
respect from people that like really

6427.719 --> 6430.599
seek out

6431.199 --> 6436.759999999999
competence so it should be good for that

6434.159 --> 6439.32
right because I mean what's more

6436.76 --> 6441.88
reliable than real

6439.32 --> 6444.159
competence I mean if somebody just wants

6441.88 --> 6446.28
a follower somebody that'll gravel to

6444.159 --> 6447.719
them then they don't care about that

6446.28 --> 6449.199
they don't care about competence if

6447.719 --> 6451.4800000000005
you're just seeking for somebody to

6449.199 --> 6454.199
grovel at you you're looking for

6451.48 --> 6456.159
somebody that can build something that

6454.199 --> 6459.28
can fix something that can improvise

6456.159 --> 6461.4
that can creative you want competence

6459.28 --> 6463.92
you want somebody that will get it right

6461.4 --> 6469.32
no matter what anybody

6463.92 --> 6473.4
says and I'm hoping to help you

6469.32 --> 6476.44
in getting that a little bit farther

6473.4 --> 6479.48
that's what I'm hoping for to help you

6476.44 --> 6479.48
all assist with

6480.96 --> 6486.159
that to give you that

6483.84 --> 6490.119000000001
edge I mean you'll probably already have

6486.159 --> 6492.44
it but I just want you to like like have

6490.119 --> 6492.44
it

6492.719 --> 6498.08
extra have it a bit more trained have it

6495.44 --> 6498.08
a bit more

6499.239 --> 6502.239
sharpened

6506.28 --> 6512.5599999999995
CU I like competence and I hate

6510.159 --> 6514.4
incompetence and yeah well you can if

6512.56 --> 6517.56
you hate incompetence you can like hunt

6514.4 --> 6520.92
it down in the world or you could just

6517.56 --> 6523.679
try to make people or help them become

6520.92 --> 6527.92
more competent

6523.679 --> 6530.679
right think that God and Jesus both

6527.92 --> 6533.84
would agree that trying to help people

6530.679 --> 6538.159
become competent it's a better Pursuit

6533.84 --> 6538.159000000001
than just hunting down incompetent

6538.52 --> 6544.159000000001
people because people can dilapidate and

6541.639 --> 6547.2390000000005
degrade all by themselves they don't

6544.159 --> 6550.48
need any help for that yeah but to

6547.239 --> 6553.36
become better that's very difficult and

6550.48 --> 6555.638999999999
you actually always will need other

6553.36 --> 6559.119
people even if you do most of it

6555.639 --> 6561.76
yourself you can never truly do it

6559.119 --> 6565.239
alone because you need other people to

6561.76 --> 6568.679
reflect on right you can't see what

6565.239 --> 6572.48
really is unless there's somebody else

6568.679 --> 6576.639
to see it for you cuz you can't see

6572.48 --> 6576.638999999999
yourself like other people can see

6576.84 --> 6582.0
you and you need that you need it for

6580.119 --> 6584.44
self-improvement that ironically you

6582.0 --> 6587.48
need other people for

6584.44 --> 6590.4
self-improvement right dilapidation you

6587.48 --> 6593.44
could do all by yourself don't need

6590.4 --> 6596.239
anybody for that to

6593.44 --> 6601.0
improve you're going to need other

6596.239 --> 6601.0
people you're going to need Community

6612.08 --> 6617.76
Trust wish there were more people out

6614.36 --> 6617.759999999999
there doing yeah I

6619.04 --> 6625.679
know

6621.32 --> 6628.759999999999
I wish most P most people would be doing

6625.679 --> 6630.28
that but hey if you want the world to be

6628.76 --> 6633.679
a better

6630.28 --> 6637.44
place then start with

6633.679 --> 6640.04
yourself be the better thing you want to

6637.44 --> 6640.04
see in the

6640.28 --> 6646.079
world and then lead by example other

6643.92 --> 6648.56
people are looking out there for

6646.079 --> 6650.5599999999995
something better and they don't know

6648.56 --> 6653.56
they they don't have the inspiration so

6650.56 --> 6657.639
if you put it down you might get others

6653.56 --> 6660.400000000001
that inspiration that they need to do

6657.639 --> 6661.88
that and that's what I'm trying whenever

6660.4 --> 6666.199
I

6661.88 --> 6668.679
can is molecular weight same as atomic

6666.199 --> 6668.678999999999
weight

6668.88 --> 6675.1990000000005
yeah it's Atomic

6671.8 --> 6678.719
molecular it's not yeah so this it's Bas

6675.199 --> 6680.919999999999
it's about isolated particle it's you

6678.719 --> 6683.04
could call it particle

6680.92 --> 6685.4
weight because that's what it's about

6683.04 --> 6687.639
it's about the idea of an individual

6685.4 --> 6690.44
atom or

6687.639 --> 6692.28
molecule that's where it differentiates

6690.44 --> 6695.159
from the

6692.28 --> 6698.5199999999995
mes of colloquial weight which is just

6695.159 --> 6700.119
like prance of material how much

6698.52 --> 6703.719
pressure does it

6700.119 --> 6707.4
cause colloquial weight molecular weight

6703.719 --> 6711.84
is like a ratio it's a number based on

6707.4 --> 6715.32
comparing it to another thing

6711.84 --> 6715.32
thing ratio

6721.32 --> 6727.719
based but yes I mean technically

6723.96 --> 6730.8
molecular weight atomic weight atomic

6727.719 --> 6735.079
mass they're all the same thing it's

6730.8 --> 6735.079000000001
just different words for the same

6738.88 --> 6741.88
thing

6746.56 --> 6755.04
right well bares 106 you're

6751.079 --> 6755.04
late I was about to round

6758.27 --> 6761.369000000001
[Music]

6766.48 --> 6772.919999999999
out would you say a person way is it say

6770.119 --> 6772.92
as a c

6773.199 --> 6781.199
what what if atoms don't

6776.28 --> 6781.199
exist well then chemistry doesn't exist

6783.639 --> 6788.679
either I mean it's not really relevant

6786.44 --> 6791.96
whether atoms exist I'm pretty sure they

6788.679 --> 6793.079
do but I mean it's just a model and it's

6791.96 --> 6796.0
the most

6793.079 --> 6798.079
reliable repeatable model that's ever

6796.0 --> 6800.96
been used and that's why they used it

6798.079 --> 6803.32
for chemistry

6800.96 --> 6805.92
so in my opinion it's not really

6803.32 --> 6807.04
relevant whether atoms actually exist as

6805.92 --> 6809.8
they are

6807.04 --> 6813.239
conceived they fulfill the

6809.8 --> 6816.320000000001
job like no other

6813.239 --> 6819.239
model and yeah maybe it can never be

6816.32 --> 6822.199
truly falsified whether it is exactly as

6819.239 --> 6827.44
the model suggests atoms

6822.199 --> 6830.159
are the ratios of the system that how it

6827.44 --> 6833.36
works that's absolutely foolproof it

6830.159 --> 6835.759999999999
works there's no holes in there

6833.36 --> 6837.5199999999995
everything is accounted for there might

6835.76 --> 6839.159000000001
be some weird little aberration here and

6837.52 --> 6840.8
there like oh where's this in this

6839.159 --> 6842.32
reaction like some of the weight goes

6840.8 --> 6844.1990000000005
missing how is that POS like what's

6842.32 --> 6846.079
happening it's like is there material

6844.199 --> 6849.199
disappearing there's some Mysteries here

6846.079 --> 6853.079
and there but I mean it's it's

6849.199 --> 6854.598999999999
microscopic compared to the completion

6853.079 --> 6857.719
of the entire

6854.599 --> 6861.0
model it's so detailed so elaborate it's

6857.719 --> 6865.76
so repeatable it works

6861.0 --> 6868.56
great so who cares at that point like if

6865.76 --> 6871.360000000001
atoms are exactly what the model suggest

6868.56 --> 6875.0
they are it's not really relevant I mean

6871.36 --> 6877.96
you're not going to get in there and and

6875.0 --> 6879.56
look at a molecule or the inside of mole

6877.96 --> 6882.119
it's never going to happen it's always

6879.56 --> 6883.8
going to be conceptual it's never going

6882.119 --> 6886.04
to be

6883.8 --> 6888.599
non-conceptual so what can you do you

6886.04 --> 6891.8
know if it works it works if you can

6888.599 --> 6893.599
never falsify it well too bad if it

6891.8 --> 6895.119000000001
works it works right at some point it

6893.599 --> 6897.4800000000005
doesn't matter anymore whether you can

6895.119 --> 6900.92
falsify it as long as it

6897.48 --> 6903.119
works it only starts to matter when you

6900.92 --> 6906.04
use it

6903.119 --> 6908.28
working as a reification for a model

6906.04 --> 6912.8
that you can't prove if you then

6908.28 --> 6916.8
prioritize the model and use the thing

6912.8 --> 6916.8
in which it is assumed to be

6916.92 --> 6921.96
happening to turn it around now the way

6919.32 --> 6924.719
yeah then you're kind of like messing it

6921.96 --> 6927.28
up you're false you can't prove it you

6924.719 --> 6931.119
can't prove atomic model exactly is the

6927.28 --> 6932.96
way that is but the way it works it does

6931.119 --> 6935.88
work like

6932.96 --> 6938.92
that so the system is

6935.88 --> 6942.639
reliable and whether atoms are exactly

6938.92 --> 6944.84
the way the model says is kind of

6942.639 --> 6946.52
irrelevant in relation to the

6944.84 --> 6949.2390000000005
functionality of it

6946.52 --> 6950.159000000001
all right anyway I'm rounding out the

6949.239 --> 6952.799999999999
show

6950.159 --> 6954.799999999999
so thanks everyone for coming I hope you

6952.8 --> 6957.28
like this show if you did then please

6968.719 --> 6973.0
please also do support me through the

6971.04 --> 6974.8
PayPal and the patreon that would be

6973.0 --> 6977.52

the support so please keep it coming

6977.52 --> 6981.4400000000005
right I'll be back tomorrow with flatter

6979.639 --> 6983.719
early bir number

6981.44 --> 6985.04
1811 on the Wednesday and I'm going to

6983.719 --> 6986.8
join the Flat Earth debates over at

6985.04 --> 6989.119
Nathan Oakley 980 Channel which would

6986.8 --> 6991.639
start up any second now hope to see you

6989.119 --> 6995.079
there in the chat and until the next

6991.639 --> 6995.079
video keep it
