125.84 --> 132.56
cold not

128.64 --> 135.07999999999998
windy barely any clouds and the sun is

132.56 --> 135.08
out and

135.68 --> 140.4
bright but it is pretty cold outside I

139.12 --> 144.36
bet it's

140.4 --> 144.36
like close to0

148.76 --> 155.16
Celsius

150.44 --> 155.16
Rosemary plan doesn't care just

158.239 --> 162.28
fine right so beautiful

166.08 --> 172.08
day this Friday the 1st of December

175.91 --> 180.44
[Music]

178.76 --> 183.519
2023

180.44 --> 185.159
temperature 2 de yep 2 degre Celsius I

183.519 --> 187.92000000000002
thought something like

185.159 --> 190.04
that looks like it's going to be that

187.92 --> 194.64
the rest of the week too if

190.04 --> 194.64
I can believe the weather prediction

195.44 --> 200.879
here and around freezing at night yeah

198.239 --> 204.36
I've noticed

200.879 --> 206.72
that but hey if if that also means these

204.36 --> 208.68
nice and bright clear mornings then

206.72 --> 211.68
maybe it's not that

208.68 --> 211.68
bad

219.0 --> 224.159
right so sorry for starting a bit late

221.76 --> 227.48
again although there's nobody here yet

224.159 --> 227.48
so maybe I'm not the only

235.92 --> 240.76
one like when it's this cold it's really

239.159 --> 245.319
tough to get out of bed because it's

240.76 --> 247.239
like hm I'm in bed it's nice and warm

245.319 --> 249.79899999999998
most of the time like I still have to be

247.239 --> 253.28
careful if

249.799 --> 255.4
I yeah like stretch your leg or anything

253.28 --> 259.959
it's still going to be

255.4 --> 262.4
cold yeah you know it it's just cold and

259.959 --> 265.44
then it's like oh get out of bed in

262.4 --> 267.52
freezing temperature almost naked and

265.44 --> 268.6
then quickly get clothes on that are not

267.52 --> 270.24
warm at

268.6 --> 273.12
all

270.24 --> 273.12
it's like a bit of a

273.56 --> 280.96
leap but I mean warm up quick enough

277.6 --> 283.08000000000004
just like quickly prepare for the show

280.96 --> 285.15999999999997
move around do stuff and it'll warm up

283.08 --> 288.75899999999996
no problem

285.16 --> 291.28000000000003
but it's just this first step bit

288.759 --> 294.47900000000004
tough also like

291.28 --> 297.4
from where I sleep I like can't see what

294.479 --> 301.56
time it is so I have to maneuver out of

297.4 --> 301.56
bed even to check the time that's a bit

302.8 --> 307.36
unfortunate right so today is going to

305.24 --> 308.84000000000003
be a relatively short show but I mean

307.36 --> 311.84000000000003
it's weekend

308.84 --> 311.84
tomorrow

311.919 --> 318.52
so an hour later standard and wow what

316.12 --> 321.24
the hell's up with these

318.52 --> 324.24
ads I'm getting ads every five minutes

321.24 --> 328.319
now the

324.24 --> 330.16
[ __ ] uh what was I

328.319 --> 333.44
saying yeah

330.16 --> 336.03900000000004
tomorrow and the day after of course

333.44 --> 338.52
weekend show and I will do much longer

336.039 --> 338.52
shows

344.84 --> 347.84
then

349.319 --> 352.40000000000003
right in the

350.71 --> 357.63899999999995
[Music]

352.4 --> 357.63899999999995
meantime I got an Illuminati

358.479 --> 363.31899999999996
cant

360.6 --> 365.84000000000003
just always kind of a joy when it's this

363.319 --> 369.91900000000004
cold it's like extra

365.84 --> 375.0
fuel it does warm me up a

369.919 --> 378.12
bit and I got it a coffee ready to brew

375.0 --> 381.44
stand Standing By downstairs as well I

378.12 --> 381.44
might take that a bit earlier

385.08 --> 390.84
too I'm just wondering when is somebody

387.72 --> 393.52000000000004
going to show up 12 watching already

390.84 --> 395.71999999999997
hello

393.52 --> 398.44
everybody right I had an interesting

395.72 --> 398.44000000000005
dream last

399.08 --> 404.24
night and it's a continu it's almost

402.4 --> 405.28
like the previous stream except it's

404.24 --> 409.08
getting more

405.28 --> 411.84
elaborate I think it's really

409.08 --> 416.44
funny like I think in my dreams I'm like

411.84 --> 420.96
having like a highway construction

416.44 --> 425.12
project like really there're certain uh

420.96 --> 425.12
highways that are

427.12 --> 435.199
uh like the road that's directly south

431.16 --> 438.96000000000004
of utra that goes east to

435.199 --> 441.199
west like moves into like a split off

438.96 --> 443.84
where it gets to de

441.199 --> 445.96000000000004
de and other places and there's like

443.84 --> 448.599
real highways where like the the road

445.96 --> 451.44
literally comes off the ground and like

448.599 --> 453.919
makes curve and others too like a real

451.44 --> 458.16
Highway thing right and something like

453.919 --> 460.52
that I was being I was part of like

458.16 --> 462.879
constructing or

460.52 --> 466.71999999999997
planning I wasn't like doing manual

462.879 --> 470.56
labor in there I was just standing there

466.72 --> 470.56
with just checking

471.12 --> 475.56
everything and it seems like a highway

473.4 --> 478.28
project and it was so funny now because

475.56 --> 480.44
I didn't even think about it it's like

478.28 --> 483.19899999999996
oh yeah Highway 9 I'm actually

480.44 --> 486.28
constructing Highway 90 in my

483.199 --> 490.039
dreams maybe at some

486.28 --> 491.87899999999996
point like refracted curvature John or

490.039 --> 494.71999999999997
Nathan is going to

491.879 --> 497.52000000000004
like make an appearance in the dream

494.72 --> 500.03900000000004
like driving by high speed on the other

497.52 --> 503.31899999999996
lane that's fully constructed you're

500.039 --> 503.31899999999996
going to need a flat Earth for

505.039 --> 512.84
that right but I like constructive

507.36 --> 512.84
dreams though building dreams they are

514.36 --> 517.36
great

527.839 --> 537.399
H okay maybe I should be

532.0 --> 537.399
checking my mod list where the hell is

538.2 --> 541.2
everybody

555.399 --> 559.399

568.12 --> 571.12
ordinary

H oh yeah anybody watch that's part of

592.64 --> 596.079

626.12 --> 635.6
late like it was up past 4 because of

631.56 --> 637.5189999999999
that got a foot of snow few days ago wow

656.399 --> 662.36
mean according to the prediction it's

659.2 --> 664.6800000000001
been moving it forward for like a week

662.36 --> 667.639
or more like oh it's good to snow but

664.68 --> 669.8389999999999
they keep moving it it's like they move

667.639 --> 672.279
it down the week it's like oh it's next

672.279 --> 677.8389999999999
it's next week yeah

675.24 --> 680.639
okay so maybe there will be some snow

677.839 --> 680.639
here that would be kind of

682.2 --> 686.76
funny crazy warm here as

687.959 --> 695.279
well right yeah it's unexpectedly warm

691.48 --> 695.279

734.639 --> 741.44
spring break it's an Autumn break it's

738.12 --> 744.72
unexpected hot weather at the end of

741.44 --> 748.5600000000001
autumn instead of at the end

744.72 --> 749.76

759.78 --> 765.159
[Music]

break

771.12 --> 778.079
March all

774.199 --> 779.4799999999999
right uh yeah the timing is not right

778.079 --> 782.2399999999999
for that

779.48 --> 788.0790000000001
it's at the beginning of of

782.24 --> 788.0790000000001
spring okay well it's the end of autumn

794.48 --> 800.5600000000001
break up past 400 a.m. I'd be like a

797.639 --> 804.5600000000001
zombie if I tried that yeah

800.56 --> 806.3199999999999
Tommy I get a bit like a zombie too but

804.56 --> 810.76
I don't don't feel sick or anything I

806.32 --> 810.7600000000001
had my sleep was great

813.32 --> 818.1990000000001
it's just I'm a bit late because of that

815.519 --> 820.76
and I'm sorry about

818.199 --> 824.16
that but I mean it was funny I mean he

820.76 --> 827.76
was like qy was and like just going

824.16 --> 830.68
completely Bel listing like playing like

827.76 --> 832.8
half a second it's like yeah I got a

830.68 --> 835.2399999999999
rant of like five

832.8 --> 839.399
minutes and it's like oh okay let's

835.24 --> 842.32
let's just do it again half a second oh

839.399 --> 847.0
he said it again immediately like half a

842.32 --> 849.839
second it's I mean it's hilarious to see

847.0 --> 852.519
that I know he does that every single

849.839 --> 856.0
time so it's like playing five minutes

852.519 --> 856.0
takes like a two

857.639 --> 860.639
hours

861.32 --> 867.1990000000001
H watching me with the lights out and

864.04 --> 867.199
headphones on oh

867.68 --> 873.7199999999999
okay

870.24 --> 873.72
make sure your eyes don't get too

873.88 --> 879.8389999999999
tired light from a screen is not exactly

876.92 --> 882.639
the best type of light for your eyes if

879.839 --> 885.2790000000001
that's the only light

882.639 --> 887.639
source I personally never watch a screen

885.279 --> 887.639
in the

890.92 --> 895.519
dark not anymore I used to do it when I

893.24 --> 899.36
was a kid because I was crazy and I

895.519 --> 901.44
would like get sick of it physically

899.36 --> 904.16
but

901.44 --> 906.399
uh I always want an extra light it's

904.16 --> 911.16
also for me important to have like a

906.399 --> 914.48
white wall behind the monitor that I'm

911.16 --> 915.88
watching cuz that also is all already a

914.48 --> 919.0790000000001
bit of light

915.88 --> 921.519
contrast just from the reflections of

919.079 --> 921.519
the white

922.04 --> 925.68
wall hey Tera

925.88 --> 930.6
306 good to see you

956.36 --> 960.6
oh uh ter you're very

962.319 --> 968.16
inspired I mean I don't mind as long as

966.04 --> 970.399
it's not about

968.16 --> 973.36
Cricket like when you really fill the

970.399 --> 975.36
chat up with Cricket that that's a bit

973.36 --> 977.6
annoying but I mean if it's like

975.36 --> 981.88
astrology again or something like that's

977.6 --> 981.88
fine you're very interesting with

984.36 --> 990.519
that I didn't exactly have like a

987.0 --> 990.519
subject at the go

992.6 --> 997.9200000000001
except for the dream about what I think

995.319 --> 997.92
is Highway

1001.279 --> 1007.959
90 that is being

1004.519 --> 1007.9590000000001
constructed in my

1017.48 --> 1020.48
dreams

1024.52 --> 1029.24
yeah don't worry teret just calm

1035.199 --> 1038.199
down

1040.959 --> 1045.64
like I don't know if you notice but like

1043.319 --> 1050.24
every time you went on about astrology

1045.64 --> 1054.5590000000002
like I'm not objecting like I'm very

1050.24 --> 1054.559
interested and I'm also interested

1054.799 --> 1063.8799999999999
in Hindu you could say mythology or like

1060.0 --> 1066.48
old teachings and like like what you

1063.88 --> 1070.16
said yeserday about Khali and spirit and

1066.48 --> 1073.08
all that being in in tune with my sign

1070.16 --> 1073.0800000000002
like that blew my

1077.4 --> 1080.4
mind

1087.919 --> 1093.1200000000001
as the woodoo kind of crazy conspiracy

1090.6 --> 1096.6399999999999
screw them

1093.12 --> 1099.559
teret screw them they just don't

1096.64 --> 1101.919
understand they just don't understand

1099.559 --> 1101.9189999999999
your

1102.72 --> 1109.559
sophistication no it's just astrology

1107.32 --> 1113.32
it's

1109.559 --> 1113.32
but you're you seem to be very good at

1118.2 --> 1125.2
it all and like oh con crazy conspiracy

1122.2 --> 1125.2
hello Arwin

1125.84 --> 1133.24
here I mean is it crazier than all my

1129.36 --> 1133.24
Dark World references and all

1134.6 --> 1140.48
that that my exploration of the other

1137.96 --> 1142.48
dimension dimensional State of

1140.48 --> 1144.799
Consciousness I mean I think that's a

1142.48 --> 1147.799
lot fuzzier actually than what you do

1144.799 --> 1152.1589999999999
because you're actually

1147.799 --> 1156.28
basing it on things that like can be

1152.159 --> 1158.7600000000002
mapped and like repeat it like somebody

1156.28 --> 1162.1589999999999
else can take the chart and come to the

1158.76 --> 1162.1589999999999
same conclusion

1167.24 --> 1170.24
so

1178.679 --> 1184.1200000000001
got one of those neighbors from hell oh

1181.4 --> 1186.64
God goes nuts every now and then jumps

1184.12 --> 1186.6399999999999
throw

1187.2 --> 1193.88
back yards

1189.52 --> 1193.8799999999999
oh smash Windows

1196.799 --> 1204.24
D wow so that that guy's like full on

1201.64 --> 1204.24
crazy

1204.32 --> 1210.4399999999998
paranoid that's me yeah I mean yeah I

1208.36 --> 1214.0
guess neighbor from but I mean that

1210.44 --> 1217.159
person probably just like

1214.0 --> 1219.84
needs medical

1217.159 --> 1221.7600000000002
assistance yeah it sounds like could be

1219.84 --> 1225.559
somebody that's like just having

1221.76 --> 1225.559
Overkill PTSD or

1227.159 --> 1230.159
something

1231.2 --> 1235.039
but I mean it's terrible to have that

1233.08 --> 1236.72
those as NE my dad used to have one of

1235.039 --> 1238.679
those in the flat

1236.72 --> 1241.0
apartment and he would like get

1238.679 --> 1244.24
depressed and then like to the edge of

1241.0 --> 1247.48
suicidal and then to counter it the only

1244.24 --> 1252.4
way he knew to like move past that was

1247.48 --> 1255.0
to put the music on at the absolute

1252.4 --> 1257.52
maximum that would be enough for me to

1255.0 --> 1259.36
like if I'd stand there I go deaf very

1257.52 --> 1260.96
quickly and and he would just do that

1259.36 --> 1263.76
and then like the entire [ __ ]

1260.96 --> 1263.76
building could hear

1268.679 --> 1273.679
it was very

1271.36 --> 1275.8799999999999
annoying also because like he wouldn't

1273.679 --> 1279.279
open the door if you rang because you

1275.88 --> 1281.2
could he couldn't hear his own B his own

1279.279 --> 1283.36
Bell

1281.2 --> 1285.76
ridiculous

1283.36 --> 1288.6789999999999
uh like the police had to come in a

1285.76 --> 1291.4
couple of occasions even with that

1288.679 --> 1291.4
we thought he was

1293.679 --> 1298.44
dead that he put it on and like got a

1296.64 --> 1302.0
heart attack cuz it

1298.44 --> 1305.799
just didn't come to the door after like

1302.0 --> 1309.6
an hour of people trying to get in Get

1305.799 --> 1312.4
Him to make it stop

1309.6 --> 1315.12
anyway at least he didn't like throw in

1312.4 --> 1315.1200000000001
Windows or

1317.039 --> 1320.039
something

1323.72 --> 1330.039
oh power line accents terrible yeah

1325.919 --> 1330.039
that's terrifying went

1330.08 --> 1334.52
crazy yeah some

1337.91 --> 1341.1190000000001
[Music]

1346.96 --> 1352.2
do

1348.88 --> 1352.2
all right so teret you're

1352.48 --> 1358.84
just you're the

1355.84 --> 1358.84
conspiracy

1373.28 --> 1379.2
[Music]

1376.36 --> 1381.7199999999998
astrologer don't don't play down your

1379.2 --> 1383.48
own skills man I mean they are what they

1381.72 --> 1386.1200000000001
are whether you're going to get

1383.48 --> 1388.0
recognition for them is one thing but

1386.12 --> 1392.4799999999998
they are what they

1388.0 --> 1392.48
are don't downplay that for

1405.279 --> 1410.88
yourself it's a gate way yeah I never

1408.0 --> 1412.84
really got that teret this whole Gateway

1410.88 --> 1415.8400000000001
with stars

1412.84 --> 1418.52
thing like what do you mean it gets kind

1415.84 --> 1421.36
of weird and fuzzy

1418.52 --> 1424.6
there like I'm interpreting as like oh

1421.36 --> 1427.8799999999999
your spirit can travel to the spiritual

1424.6 --> 1429.7199999999998
regions or something because it's not

1427.88 --> 1432.7990000000002
actually a physical

1429.72 --> 1434.72
place but like astrology people like

1432.799 --> 1437.08
don't get that a lot of the time because

1434.72 --> 1439.24
they don't know about Flat Earth it's

1437.08 --> 1441.84
really confusing like even my healer has

1439.24 --> 1441.84
issues with

1442.84 --> 1451.76
that because it does seem to like be a

1445.919 --> 1451.76
thing like all the the planet of these

1455.12 --> 1460.52
spirits but I mean I guess they're

1459.08 --> 1464.32
designated

1460.52 --> 1466.799
planets in the spirit realm that's how

1464.32 --> 1469.84
people see it so that is how it

1466.799 --> 1472.679
manifests but I really see it as like

1469.84 --> 1475.0
it's just this giant endless room of

1472.679 --> 1477.76
frequencies and wherever energy can

1475.0 --> 1479.84
twist itself to and it's like what

1477.76 --> 1482.36
frequency within

1479.84 --> 1484.6399999999999
the virtual

1482.36 --> 1487.0
cube of all

1484.64 --> 1489.1200000000001
possibilities like where is it that's

1487.0 --> 1492.48
rather how I see it like they rest in a

1489.12 --> 1496.7199999999998
certain frequency it's not a

1492.48 --> 1499.76
place it's a balance of energy that's

1496.72 --> 1499.76
where they hang

1512.44 --> 1517.799
anyway so there are these weird

1514.799 --> 1522.48
communication issues with like how

1517.799 --> 1522.48
astrology expresses things it is very

1524.399 --> 1528.7199999999998
confusing almost as confusing as like oh

1527.399 --> 1532.1999999999998
the

1528.72 --> 1534.52
particle wave duality of light that has

1532.2 --> 1537.64
a speed but

1534.52 --> 1539.72
it's but it's also a

1537.64 --> 1542.3600000000001
wave that sort of

1539.72 --> 1545.24
nonsense I mean that's also really

1542.36 --> 1548.7199999999998
confusing I think that astrology for all

1545.24 --> 1550.159
its legitimacy like has been subjected

1548.72 --> 1554.72
probably

1550.159 --> 1558.3600000000001
to Jesuit meddling it's like oh when you

1554.72 --> 1561.3990000000001
describe these ethereal regions you just

1558.36 --> 1564.32
call it planets I really think that

1561.399 --> 1567.84
those freaking Jesuits way back just

1564.32 --> 1567.84
went around and basically

1568.24 --> 1572.84
rewrote the

1570.08 --> 1575.36
expressions of how to regard these

1572.84 --> 1579.1999999999998
ethereal

1575.36 --> 1582.24
things so that astrology Community just

1579.2 --> 1584.2
tends to like designate it as planets

1582.24 --> 1586.6
and it's like colloquial and everything

1584.2 --> 1589.6000000000001
I think the Jesuits did

1586.6 --> 1589.6
that

1590.76 --> 1596.08
as part of when they went around like

1593.159 --> 1596.0800000000002
meddling with all the

1613.08 --> 1619.6
religions what what are you talking

1616.6 --> 1619.6
about

1626.2 --> 1629.279
since you've been watching my show

1627.88 --> 1630.8400000000001
you've been getting some real mad

1629.279 --> 1632.679
recommendation oh I don't want to hear

1630.84 --> 1637.4399999999998
about that Tom

1632.679 --> 1637.44
me I get really weird recommendations

1639.159 --> 1645.3200000000002
too like sometimes like YouTube gets in

1642.159 --> 1645.3200000000002
a weird mood or

1646.52 --> 1652.52
something

1648.24 --> 1655.88
but also like exploring around in

1652.52 --> 1658.08
Rumble cuz that I'm I'm relatively new

1655.88 --> 1658.0800000000002
to

1660.44 --> 1666.0800000000002
rumble I got all kinds of stuff on there

1664.399 --> 1669.039
all they're actually they even like

1666.08 --> 1672.399
there's just the Alex Jones Show there I

1669.039 --> 1674.2
mean normally I watch it on band. video

1672.399 --> 1676.5189999999998
but there's no chat but on Rumble there

1674.2 --> 1678.88
is a chat but I mean it's filled with

1676.519 --> 1682.64
complete credit

1678.88 --> 1685.48
though like just really angry super

1682.64 --> 1689.519
polarizing like attack him attack like

1685.48 --> 1689.519
dude what the [ __ ] is wrong with

1689.6 --> 1693.12
you crazy

1693.96 --> 1698.919
people but yeah Rumble has all kinds of

1701.84 --> 1706.9189999999999
channels makes me feel like I would love

1705.0 --> 1709.919
to like eventually start streaming to

1706.919 --> 1712.88
rumble too I I definitely choose it as

1709.919 --> 1715.5590000000002
another streaming

1712.88 --> 1719.6000000000001
option cuz it does look good and it's

1715.559 --> 1719.6
fluid and it has very little

1721.44 --> 1728.93
issues I'd say it's a bit more stable

1725.32 --> 1730.9189999999999
than YouTube although YouTube has great

1728.93 --> 1733.6000000000001
[Music]

1730.919 --> 1736.3990000000001
functions YouTube also just has weird

1733.6 --> 1740.4399999999998
times where it's just getting freaky and

1736.399 --> 1745.1589999999999
glitchy I haven't seen that with Rumble

1740.44 --> 1745.159
yet what's Rumble ET

1745.279 --> 1749.919
what you don't know Rumble is a

1747.799 --> 1754.6
streaming platform like

1749.919 --> 1754.6000000000001
YouTube you don't know that Tommy

1755.88 --> 1762.44
what yeah everyone banned from YouTube

1758.44 --> 1765.919
is in Rumble chat I bet well I haven't

1762.44 --> 1769.88
come across like the scummy ass wipes

1765.919 --> 1771.72
that stop me yet though I really

1769.88 --> 1773.7990000000002
expected like oh yeah I'm going to go to

1771.72 --> 1776.799
rumble and they're right there going to

1773.799 --> 1779.48
be in my face again w't they but

1776.799 --> 1779.48
apparently they

1780.399 --> 1785.32
don't I haven't bumped into any

1783.679 --> 1788.919
familiar

1785.32 --> 1790.519
dickwad from YouTube that I remember

1788.919 --> 1792.6000000000001
over there yet and I've been like

1790.519 --> 1796.1200000000001
chatting all over the place like o

1792.6 --> 1799.32
Benjamin chat Alex Jones chat other

1796.12 --> 1799.32
streamers chats

1803.039 --> 1809.44
cuz sometimes it's just like for example

1806.399 --> 1812.1999999999998
a trump speech is like it's just funny

1809.44 --> 1815.0800000000002
to me I there's this funny energy to it

1812.2 --> 1817.48
and yeah problems whatever it's just

1815.08 --> 1819.6789999999999
sometimes I don't [ __ ] care okay

1817.48 --> 1823.919
sometimes I just want to have a bit of

1819.679 --> 1826.64
fun and then just just like chat

1823.919 --> 1829.88
around just to like see how everybody's

1826.64 --> 1832.43
responding to that to me resonating with

1829.88 --> 1835.6190000000001
the energy or

1832.43 --> 1835.6190000000001
[Music]

1840.399 --> 1845.279
something right but there's plenty of

1842.399 --> 1848.1589999999999
streamers on Rumble uh not all of them

1845.279 --> 1850.44
are good but there's some real Crushers

1848.159 --> 1850.44
on

1854.72 --> 1861.279
there but I mean they also have like

1857.279 --> 1861.279
like liberal trash

1861.36 --> 1866.1589999999999
too anyway I'm going to dig into this ah

1864.679 --> 1869.799
Illuminati or something for it's

1866.159 --> 1869.7990000000002
completely cold

1877.19 --> 1880.3690000000001
[Music]

1881.2 --> 1886.159
cheers you know what and I want my

1884.6 --> 1888.32
coffee damn

1886.159 --> 1891.96
it

1888.32 --> 1891.96
I'm going to get a

1916.159 --> 1919.159
coffee

1933.24 --> 1936.76
right so

1937.32 --> 1942.6789999999999
yeah the issue

1939.799 --> 1947.2
is thus far I've only really been able

1942.679 --> 1950.48
to use OBS Studio to stream to one plat

1947.2 --> 1953.3600000000001
form at the same time while I

1950.48 --> 1955.039
know that it is possible to stream to

1953.36 --> 1957.279
multiple

1955.039 --> 1959.799
platforms I just basically haven't been

1957.279 --> 1961.96
able to work it

1959.799 --> 1964.6
out I think you might like need a

1961.96 --> 1964.6000000000001
splitter

1965.48 --> 1971.6
program that literally sends it toward

1969.2 --> 1974.159
towards multiple

1971.6 --> 1976.32
platforms I I don't even know for sure

1974.159 --> 1979.0390000000002
if my computer can handle that kind of

1976.32 --> 1979.039
program

1979.96 --> 1982.159
it

1982.399 --> 1986.399
should but yeah I haven't really been

1984.799 --> 1988.48
able to work it out like I'm going to

1986.399 --> 1990.6789999999999
need some serious technical assistance

1988.48 --> 1993.159
with that somebody who knows how to set

1990.679 --> 1993.159
that up

1994.679 --> 1998.2
properly cuz

1998.279 --> 2001.279
like

2005.96 --> 2010.0
yeah

2008.08 --> 2011.799
it was like the same with audio banana I

2010.0 --> 2014.32
couldn't get it to work just couldn't

2011.799 --> 2017.96
get it to work oh follow these

2014.32 --> 2020.8799999999999
instructions yeah and then do that yeah

2017.96 --> 2025.1200000000001
that option's not

2020.88 --> 2027.24
there so now yeah can't continue

2025.12 --> 2029.039
following instructions anymore because

2027.24 --> 2031.44
yeah they made me do something that

2029.039 --> 2035.32
literally isn't

2031.44 --> 2035.3200000000002
there so got

2035.96 --> 2038.96
stuck

2041.44 --> 2045.88
anyway I'm fine with streaming to one

2046.08 --> 2053.04
platform but I would like to see like

2049.639 --> 2054.839
what how I would be received and Rumble

2053.04 --> 2058.919
what would happen with the

2054.839 --> 2062.0
chat I just kind of want to

2058.919 --> 2064.0
see if there really is like a clamp on

2062.0 --> 2067.2
me from YouTube because I'm a flat

2064.0 --> 2071.04
earther and I get angry or whatever well

2067.2 --> 2074.04
homophobic and anti-semitic or

2071.04 --> 2074.04
racist

2090.96 --> 2095.7200000000003
whatever Tin Tin oh

2095.879 --> 2098.879
God

2099.64 --> 2107.1189999999997
I used to like Tintin as a

2102.2 --> 2107.1189999999997
kid but my God is it [ __ ]

2107.8 --> 2115.32
dumb I mean it's kind of interesting but

2111.52 --> 2120.04
like the total interactions is really

2115.32 --> 2120.04
really dumb and

2125.8 --> 2129.2000000000003
annoying

2127.4 --> 2133.28
cuz there is like a series of that a

2129.2 --> 2135.2799999999997
cartoon series animated series I

2133.28 --> 2136.3590000000004
actually tried watching that on Netflix

2135.28 --> 2139.6400000000003
I got

2136.359 --> 2142.2
like half an hour into it and then was

2139.64 --> 2145.56
like I just I'm not going to [ __ ]

2142.2 --> 2147.72
subject myself to that anymore it's so

2145.56 --> 2150.16
lame and

2147.72 --> 2152.359
dumb like all my memories are like yeah

2150.16 --> 2155.2
all tinted oh that's awesome and he went

2152.359 --> 2157.56
into that rocket or something one time

2155.2 --> 2160.359
right but dude

2157.56 --> 2162.48
grown up it's like holy [ __ ] this is

2160.359 --> 2165.4
[ __ ]

2162.48 --> 2167.92
dumb how the hell did it ever work on me

2165.4 --> 2167.92
I don't get

2168.599 --> 2173.7200000000003
it but I mean like my parents were

2171.52 --> 2176.24
apparently infatuated with it too as

2173.72 --> 2181.7599999999998
kids and all yeah

2176.24 --> 2181.7599999999998
so it's weird asteris and

2183.72 --> 2188.72
oix I mean asteris and oblix is kind of

2186.4 --> 2188.7200000000003
fun

2190.68 --> 2197.24
it's a bit dumb but I

2193.28 --> 2201.7200000000003
mean it's sort of makes sense and it's

2197.24 --> 2201.72
funny it's actually funny and not

2207.92 --> 2215.6800000000003
lame and I mean [ __ ] the Romans

2212.64 --> 2218.68
right by that alone it's kind of

2215.68 --> 2218.68
fun

2232.44 --> 2236.48
is I'm going to get my

2241.2 --> 2248.5989999999997
coffee the next movie you're talking

2244.48 --> 2248.599
about the liveaction movie right

2250.24 --> 2254.8799999999997
I didn't really like the like liveaction

2252.44 --> 2257.2400000000002
movie too

2254.88 --> 2261.6800000000003
much I like the comic

2257.24 --> 2261.68
strips and I think there was a cartoon

2262.88 --> 2270.839
too I don't know but the movies were all

2267.68 --> 2272.48
right they're not I just when I was a

2270.839 --> 2275.0
kid I like the

2272.48 --> 2277.4
cartoon drawings and all that better I

2275.0 --> 2278.8
like that more

2277.4 --> 2281.869
life action was

2278.8 --> 2281.869
[Music]

2285.119 --> 2293.6800000000003
like hey Dan good to see

2288.119 --> 2293.6800000000003

2305.52 --> 2308.52
coffee

2335.52 --> 2338.52
for

2358.119 --> 2364.319
right but I mean it's because Asis and

2361.839 --> 2367.92
Obelix right the

2364.319 --> 2372.04
movie every time I saw that that it only

2367.92 --> 2372.04
made me want to watch like Life of

2372.079 --> 2376.7200000000003
Brian

2374.119 --> 2379.52
seriously cuz that's like actually

2376.72 --> 2381.04
really funny and like more serious

2379.52 --> 2383.72
acting in a way even though it's

2381.04 --> 2383.72
completely

2391.86 --> 2394.969
[Music]

2395.4 --> 2398.4
silly

2398.52 --> 2405.48
so yeah I'm like a I don't like I was a

2402.64 --> 2406.93
I don't like ASX and oix the movie

2405.48 --> 2408.64
guy

2406.93 --> 2413.44
[Music]

2408.64 --> 2417.92
but it I like it has aged better than

2413.44 --> 2417.92
some other things I'll give you

2425.359 --> 2429.52
that

2427.79 --> 2432.88
[Music]

2429.52 --> 2435.359
also just like the setup the story setup

2432.88 --> 2437.6800000000003
for asteris and oblix is actually just

2435.359 --> 2437.68
kind of

2438.56 --> 2443.68
fun and like everybody that's been to

2441.119 --> 2445.6800000000003
school will have some reference like oh

2443.68 --> 2448.72
it's the Romans and the galliens and

2445.68 --> 2451.68
like I had I learned about that in

2448.72 --> 2454.56
history so that kind of make asteris and

2451.68 --> 2456.52
oblix more fun and like if your

2454.56 --> 2459.92
teacher's like really into it he might

2456.52 --> 2459.92
even bring up asteris and

2461.52 --> 2464.7599999999998
ovix in

2467.2 --> 2470.2
school

2478.16 --> 2481.16
anyway

2485.24 --> 2492.8799999999997
what the tined movie oh wait there's a

2489.76 --> 2495.76
an animated movie I was talking about a

2492.88 --> 2497.48
series I didn't know there was like a

2495.76 --> 2500.48
animated

2497.48 --> 2500.48
movie

2501.28 --> 2504.5600000000004
really from

2511.359 --> 2514.359
when

2515.24 --> 2518.24
h

2525.28 --> 2528.52
from what year was that

2531.0 --> 2535.039
[Music]

2536.72 --> 2545.16
DED are you g to make me Google

2540.2 --> 2549.5589999999997
it 2015 oh wow that's late

2545.16 --> 2552.319
okay I had no idea there was such a

2549.559 --> 2554.559
thing I was referencing to like a a

2552.319 --> 2556.92
series that's probably like from the 80s

2554.559 --> 2559.88
or 90s or something and that's freaking

2556.92 --> 2559.88
mortifyingly

2563.599 --> 2566.96
boring but

2570.48 --> 2578.4
oh right I haven't bumped into that one

2573.44 --> 2578.4
yet maybe I will now that it's being

2580.96 --> 2583.96
discussed

2584.25 --> 2587.429
[Music]

2592.359 --> 2597.2
H let me continue this for it's all

2605.079 --> 2608.079
cold

2632.72 --> 2638.0789999999997
[Music]

2635.079 --> 2638.079
for

2641.359 --> 2644.88
H yeah good to see you by the way slow M

2643.88 --> 2648.599
moon

2644.88 --> 2648.599
buggy slipped in

2656.8 --> 2661.92
there RAM for multiple platform I don't

2663.72 --> 2669.48
know I mean with the whole multi

2667.0 --> 2673.04
streaming there's people that literally

2669.48 --> 2676.119
stream and and keep track of like three

2673.04 --> 2679.839
different live chats at the same time so

2676.119 --> 2683.76
it is not re it's possible to do it live

2679.839 --> 2683.7599999999998
while you're while the video is

2684.92 --> 2690.319
recording I just don't exactly know how

2687.24 --> 2690.319
to get it to work like

2694.96 --> 2697.96
that

2699.76 --> 2706.76
man this Illuminati C and the turmeric

2703.079 --> 2706.76
coffee both are really hitting the

2724.88 --> 2727.88
spot

2738.839 --> 2745.359
right so yeah we still got a little over

2742.48 --> 2745.359
a half hour

2748.359 --> 2753.0789999999997
left I wish I could like dig back into

2751.319 --> 2754.88
Flat Earth talking about Flat Earth

2753.079 --> 2758.7200000000003
there's like a lot of things that I have

2754.88 --> 2761.839
said in the past and lay down

2758.72 --> 2766.0
and sometimes I wish like more people

2761.839 --> 2770.2
that were actually curious about Flat

2766.0 --> 2770.2
Earth would come to me and ask

2771.96 --> 2776.96
questions and people have done that and

2774.559 --> 2780.28
I think I've really provided when they

2776.96 --> 2782.68
did I just wish it was more like I don't

2780.28 --> 2785.44
mind doing that

2782.68 --> 2787.7999999999997
like every two days or something or

2785.44 --> 2787.8
every day

2788.359 --> 2796.16
I mean yeah the guys here you

2792.52 --> 2800.28
know that's not no news to

2796.16 --> 2803.7999999999997
you but it's like I have an ability to

2800.28 --> 2808.0
explain these things especially to new

2803.8 --> 2813.079
people to make really complicated things

2808.0 --> 2817.8
presented in a way that it is

2813.079 --> 2817.8
doable like I know how to do that

2818.839 --> 2823.7999999999997
and I wish like more newbies would

2821.319 --> 2826.52
basically show up and and like find The

2823.8 --> 2830.559
Bravery to just kind of ask questions

2826.52 --> 2830.559
about it and like don't worry about it

2835.119 --> 2841.559
like if you're like going to get it

2838.16 --> 2844.2
wrong and you're a newbie like you have

2841.559 --> 2846.0400000000004
absolutely nothing to worry about

2844.2 --> 2849.1189999999997
because there's a lot of weird things

2846.04 --> 2851.5589999999997
going around information

2849.119 --> 2854.6400000000003
wise on what to

2851.559 --> 2858.8390000000004
assume about how the Flat Earth is or

2854.64 --> 2858.839
other things or even the

2859.24 --> 2865.839
ball so it's like I'd expect any

2863.44 --> 2868.559
newcomer to like get a few things wrong

2865.839 --> 2871.2799999999997
like that's an expectation it would be

2868.559 --> 2873.8
weirder if they got it all

2871.28 --> 2877.2400000000002
right that's like more suspicious

2873.8 --> 2879.96
actually if I don't know you

2877.24 --> 2883.319
you get it all exactly right that's like

2879.96 --> 2883.319
are you stalking

2885.28 --> 2891.7200000000003
me no probably just following

2888.559 --> 2893.28
but I just love to talk be able to talk

2891.72 --> 2897.2
about Flat Earth

2893.28 --> 2899.6800000000003
more although I do actually do that like

2897.2 --> 2903.4399999999996
on Flat Earth

2899.68 --> 2903.44
debates when I get to

2904.64 --> 2907.64
talk

2914.2 --> 2918.64
it's just for a show that's called Flat

2916.319 --> 2921.72
Earth early bird I'd wish there was a

2918.64 --> 2925.48
little bit more of the Flat

2921.72 --> 2925.48
Earth in there

2934.16 --> 2939.0
sometimes but yeah doesn't work if

2936.44 --> 2941.92
there's no people that really want to

2939.0 --> 2944.28
hear me out about those

2941.92 --> 2947.44
things right maybe people are getting

2944.28 --> 2950.3590000000004
like saturated with flat earth like yeah

2947.44 --> 2952.359
we we we get it know it's this and that

2950.359 --> 2954.48
but here's the thing you might be

2952.359 --> 2958.52
saturated out there with what you've

2954.48 --> 2961.2
seen video wise about Flat Earth but are

2958.52 --> 2962.799
you actually

2961.2 --> 2965.64
saturated

2962.799 --> 2968.4
because your Curiosity has been

2965.64 --> 2971.92
fulfilled or because basically the leads

2968.4 --> 2975.0
kind of got watered down and died on you

2971.92 --> 2978.559
like left you in

2975.0 --> 2980.96
Wonder but like it's just bogged down

2978.559 --> 2983.3590000000004
because that is what some Flat Earth

2980.96 --> 2984.48
just do is like oh flut flut and then

2983.359 --> 2988.0
they kind of

2984.48 --> 2990.599
like don't really help you that much

2988.0 --> 2992.2
understand it better rather send you on

2990.599 --> 2995.2000000000003
some kind of hippie

2992.2 --> 2998.72
spiritual direction or whatever that

2995.2 --> 2998.72
doesn't really help you prove it's

3004.96 --> 3013.359
flat so yeah you might think you know

3009.799 --> 3013.359
things about Flat Earth out

3013.44 --> 3020.839
there but are you sure that what you

3017.28 --> 3023.48
know is the real

3020.839 --> 3026.24
thing there's a lot of like wild

3023.48 --> 3029.119
speculation that's happened

3026.24 --> 3032.319
among flat earthers online for years

3029.119 --> 3034.2400000000002
wild wild speculations and yeah there's

3032.319 --> 3036.079
like good arguments going to go around

3034.24 --> 3038.319
like rumors and then people like figure

3036.079 --> 3040.6400000000003
it out like oh yeah yeah Flat Earth

3038.319 --> 3043.04
debates really do have good

3040.64 --> 3045.799
points but then there's also the anti

3043.04 --> 3048.64
flatter Debaters crowd that specifically

3045.799 --> 3050.559
avoid any kind of talking point that we

3048.64 --> 3052.92
have

3050.559 --> 3056.1600000000003
almost and there's plenty of those out

3052.92 --> 3059.2000000000003
there as well so you don't really know

3056.16 --> 3061.2
if what you know

3059.2 --> 3063.96
works until

3061.2 --> 3067.9199999999996
you put it

3063.96 --> 3067.92
down put that cookie

3078.4 --> 3082.92

3132.119 --> 3137.52
don't really match together in a way

3139.12 --> 3142.15
[Music]

hippies you say

3221.04 --> 3227.839
hey I kind of love it

me another me doing that I'd also say

3234.16 --> 3237.16
hey

3237.92 --> 3241.0
but I'm the one saying

3247.44 --> 3253.88
it holy [ __ ] talking about hippie dippy

3250.599 --> 3259.6400000000003
people so you can start there's like

3253.88 --> 3259.6400000000003
this hiy woman I think it's like the

3259.96 --> 3264.44
sister like in six feet under that

3262.52 --> 3267.44
series that apparently is like one of

3264.44 --> 3271.119
the the number two gay series of all

3267.44 --> 3273.799
times apparently I didn't know that not

3271.119 --> 3275.04
too surprised the writing is overall

3273.799 --> 3279.64
pretty damn

3275.04 --> 3281.72
good it's like it's not

3279.64 --> 3285.7599999999998
just gay

3281.72 --> 3289.2799999999997
good sis gender bad no it's sort of

3285.76 --> 3291.28
balanced but oh let's move on anyway

3289.28 --> 3295.4
like the sister of the mother of the

3291.28 --> 3298.2400000000002
house is like this this raging being

3295.4 --> 3300.799

and Greg was a hippie dippy stereotype

3304.559 --> 3311.559
holy [ __ ] this

3307.839 --> 3314.44
person I mean convincing but like one of

3311.559 --> 3316.7200000000003
those that's like really like sort of

3314.44 --> 3316.7200000000003
like

3316.87 --> 3323.799
[Music]

3319.72 --> 3323.799

3330.16 --> 3334.48
of the hippie type think it's weird

3336.599 --> 3340.079
man so

3340.92 --> 3346.28
yeah I am kind of fascinated with hippie

3344.0 --> 3348.48
characters in like series and all that

3346.28 --> 3348.48
and

3354.0 --> 3357.0
movies

3366.839 --> 3371.68
like even what's a god I always forget

3369.52 --> 3371.68
the

3373.4 --> 3378.799
name the girl was always on with the

3375.88 --> 3378.799
guitar in

3379.599 --> 3384.6800000000003
friends she was also like a super hippie

3382.48 --> 3386.039
really funny interesting character by

3384.68 --> 3388.52
the way

3386.039 --> 3391.6800000000003
like the only likable thing pretty much

3388.52 --> 3391.68
in the entire damn

3393.16 --> 3399.3999999999996
Series

3395.48 --> 3399.4
yeah Phoebe that's

3399.44 --> 3406.76
right I mean that's a freaking hilarious

3402.799 --> 3406.7599999999998
character really original

3407.599 --> 3412.3590000000004
too like you know that's actually what

3410.48 --> 3416.88
she's

3412.359 --> 3416.88
like a lot of it

3419.2 --> 3426.16
very intelligent absolutely seeking like

3422.559 --> 3429.48
really and but I can tell you can tell

3426.16 --> 3434.1189999999997
that like her her comedy and her

3429.48 --> 3434.119
internal how that works is very

3435.0 --> 3440.52
serious it's not some vague madeup

3438.039 --> 3445.7200000000003
horeshit that like she's pretending to

3440.52 --> 3447.799
be no that's those are real things she's

3445.72 --> 3451.9599999999996
talking

3447.799 --> 3455.52
about very smart girl woman

3451.96 --> 3455.52
sorry older than

3457.16 --> 3464.16
me right and that playing the dits is

3460.559 --> 3464.1600000000003
like that's just

3464.48 --> 3473.0
like she would just play dumb

3469.16 --> 3475.16
like like how some women can play dumb

3473.0 --> 3478.44
and basically become more attract active

3475.16 --> 3481.64
to a guy that way she kind of did that

3478.44 --> 3483.44
trick sometimes literally in the series

3481.64 --> 3487.48
and she would even like play around with

3483.44 --> 3491.52
oh I'm so dumb oh and then like mm I got

3487.48 --> 3493.4
him right so it's like it's just like

3491.52 --> 3496.4
yeah it's a more interesting character

3493.4 --> 3496.4
than all the rest of

3496.799 --> 3501.079
them wise full archetype

3503.72 --> 3506.72
yeah

3511.92 --> 3516.88
anyway another hippie character that I

3514.52 --> 3516.88
really

3519.079 --> 3524.079
like and by the way talking about hippie

3521.48 --> 3526.079
characters that I really liked like in

3524.079 --> 3528.28
Dharma and Greg I

3526.079 --> 3531.44
liked

3528.28 --> 3533.3190000000004
dad I like dma's Dad I thought he was

3531.44 --> 3537.7200000000003
freaking

3533.319 --> 3537.72
awesome and he had his issues but I

3538.28 --> 3543.76
mean yeah he wasn't probably the

3541.359 --> 3547.68
strongest of dads I mean he did let like

3543.76 --> 3547.6800000000003
Mom walk all over him and all

3548.88 --> 3555.839
that but I mean I did very much relate

3551.799 --> 3559.0389999999998
to that thing I mean my dad and my mom

3555.839 --> 3561.839
had issues at home too like basically my

3559.039 --> 3563.6800000000003
mom was walking all over my dad and he

3561.839 --> 3565.2799999999997
couldn't really deal with that too so

3563.68 --> 3569.2799999999997
that was like

3565.28 --> 3569.28
huh you guys too

3575.359 --> 3580.5589999999997
huh anyway I don't know how the hell the

3578.839 --> 3584.2

3871.48 --> 3875.4
anybody but there's some people there

3873.4 --> 3878.359

3875.4 --> 3880.64
times and you agitate them

3878.359 --> 3882.7599999999998
duper you should really learn to deal

3880.64 --> 3885.0
with that yeah if you notice that people

3882.76 --> 3890.1600000000003
are agitated by you you shouldn't like

3885.0 --> 3893.16
just show up in their in their face like

3890.16 --> 3895.0389999999998
that

3893.16 --> 3897.44

chat a while ago let's be

4031.92 --> 4037.44

4034.119 --> 4037.44
you're like

4038.039 --> 4045.3190000000004
nefarious but Flat Earth debate has its

4042.0 --> 4047.48
own moderators that don't work by my

4045.319 --> 4051.119
code or

4047.48 --> 4054.2400000000002
standards and so they don't like you

4051.119 --> 4056.44
