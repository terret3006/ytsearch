good morning

39.2 --> 42.96

they'll be much appreciated

66.56 --> 73.04
so finally managed to start

70.4 --> 74.88000000000001
on time i thought it started just a few

73.04 --> 77.92
minutes early to compensate for the

74.88 --> 77.92
previous few days

78.24 --> 84.96
uh right the weather today again is

81.68 --> 88.08000000000001
well different it's wind still

84.96 --> 89.439
pretty much well pretty much like

88.08 --> 94.479
yesterday evening it was

89.439 --> 96.79899999999999
eerily wind still it was cold

94.479 --> 98.24
and very very winds that was weird

96.799 --> 100.96000000000001
because you could literally hear

98.24 --> 101.439
sounds from a distance just minor sounds

100.96 --> 104.72
people

101.439 --> 106.24
walking on on tiles and [ __ ]

104.72 --> 107.84
could hear that in the distance because

106.24 --> 110.88
it was that wind still

107.84 --> 114.32000000000001
right now not that wind still

110.88 --> 117.19999999999999
and it's yeah cloudy not thick clouds

114.32 --> 121.27999999999999
it's just covered up

117.2 --> 124.0
and it's cold and it's a little water

121.28 --> 126.24
cold maybe

124.0 --> 127.36
maybe some extra moist in the air hold

126.24 --> 130.879
on let me

127.36 --> 132.239
untangle this stupid wire tangled for

130.879 --> 135.44
days now

132.239 --> 135.44
all right there you go

136.64 --> 140.64
so i got green tea with me

144.08 --> 148.0
let's see who's in chat okay good

146.8 --> 151.44
servant who's first

148.0 --> 157.84
agm oprah moko good to see you

151.44 --> 157.84
so far it's monday again

161.28 --> 168.08
yeah and

164.56 --> 169.92000000000002
i got some paypal funds in just in time

168.08 --> 172.64000000000001
because yesterday i was pretty much

169.92 --> 176.48
broke after i done groceries

172.64 --> 178.79999999999998
i found out so yeah things have been

176.48 --> 181.2
connecting smoothly thanks for all the

178.8 --> 181.20000000000002
support

181.28 --> 188.4
please please keep it coming

184.64 --> 191.83999999999997
um right

188.4 --> 195.28
so yesterday was it very late

191.84 --> 195.28
not super late

196.159 --> 200.07999999999998
but yeah there was a lot of stuff going

197.92 --> 200.07999999999998
on

200.159 --> 208.319
right i started off very late

204.319 --> 209.2
felt very like a weird even mistaked it

208.319 --> 212.95899999999997
for being

209.2 --> 215.35999999999999
in weekday and all thought that yeah

212.959 --> 216.4
didn't realize it was sunday so like

215.36 --> 218.15900000000002
yesterday it was a

216.4 --> 220.48000000000002
it was pretty good conversation i think

218.159 --> 224.239
with a good servant

220.48 --> 225.67999999999998
but i was yeah he basically rescued me

224.239 --> 227.84
otherwise i would have been probably

225.68 --> 229.84
flustered the entire show

227.84 --> 231.20000000000002
so thank you for that again good servant

229.84 --> 233.439
it was great to have you on

231.2 --> 235.439
again to have a guest on again i don't

233.439 --> 237.12
know

235.439 --> 238.72
why i don't do that more often it's

237.12 --> 241.76
pretty good

238.72 --> 245.92
but yeah after that the flat earth

241.76 --> 248.239
debate premiered and this time it was

245.92 --> 250.159
the conflict show so i thought it was

248.239 --> 253.68
gonna stream on saturday but nathan

250.159 --> 256.0
i guess switched them around and

253.68 --> 258.079
it was good to hear that back i was a

256.0 --> 262.32
lot more audible than i thought

258.079 --> 266.479
i didn't i wasn't sure if

262.32 --> 266.479
i was audible

266.72 --> 273.04
but most of my points i was despite

270.72 --> 275.84000000000003
the rest also butting it i was in chat

273.04 --> 278.16
and it was very audible

275.84 --> 279.11999999999995
because yeah i was pissed off in that

278.16 --> 281.28000000000003
situation

279.12 --> 282.32
that i basically that people were still

281.28 --> 285.52
kidding around when

282.32 --> 289.44
i was living giving clear signals that

285.52 --> 291.44
hold on your i got the feeling you're

289.44 --> 291.84
attacking my personal integrity because

291.44 --> 295.6
this

291.84 --> 297.44
is a serious remark about the

295.6 --> 299.12
yeah the orientation of the earth and

297.44 --> 303.36
all that and the potential for

299.12 --> 306.4
looping and it's not scientific

303.36 --> 311.68
maybe but it's as good as it gets it

306.4 --> 315.35999999999996
it falls in the same direction as

311.68 --> 318.16
says it obviously and observably flat

315.36 --> 318.96000000000004
well if that is evidence other than

318.16 --> 323.03900000000004
signs then

318.96 --> 326.23999999999995
my evidence i'm seeking it in the same

323.039 --> 328.08
field on the same level and hey it is

326.24 --> 330.24
falsifiable not scientifically

328.08 --> 333.28
falsifiable but it is

330.24 --> 334.24
once we figure out the orientation of

333.28 --> 336.88
each

334.24 --> 338.639
landmass and ocean bottom in relation to

336.88 --> 341.919
all the others

338.639 --> 344.32
and we cross reference it with the

341.919 --> 344.96
apparent equator because it's all about

344.32 --> 347.36
referencing

344.96 --> 348.32
the land masses and the ocean bottoms

347.36 --> 351.199
with each other

348.32 --> 352.08
that's the primary and then as a

351.199 --> 354.96000000000004
secondary

352.08 --> 357.35999999999996
on top of that we use the apparent

354.96 --> 357.84
celestial orientation the equator line

357.36 --> 359.36
right

357.84 --> 361.44
because it's nothing about that is

359.36 --> 364.24
literal but we use that

361.44 --> 366.319
as a guide to figure out what the

364.24 --> 369.44
equator line really is

366.319 --> 373.03900000000004
how does this apparent celestial sphere

369.44 --> 373.6
move over our earth how is it orientated

373.039 --> 375.36
really

373.6 --> 378.08000000000004
once we figure out once we cross

375.36 --> 381.28000000000003
reference all the

378.08 --> 383.039
yeah all the locations and that was my

381.28 --> 384.55999999999995
entire point

383.039 --> 386.24
but they didn't want to hear it because

384.56 --> 388.56
nathan just insisted

386.24 --> 390.16
that i was tying it into the celestial

388.56 --> 392.24
positions like i was trying to

390.16 --> 395.44
pre-suppose some kind of shape with it

392.24 --> 397.6
see like the ballers do and it wasn't

395.44 --> 399.039
and it was very upfront about that so

397.6 --> 402.0
yeah

399.039 --> 402.71999999999997
here it is here's my response hearing it

402.0 --> 405.759
back

402.72 --> 405.759
as i said i would

407.039 --> 414.4
right all of you got that you did

410.88 --> 414.4
good let's move on

418.16 --> 421.36
all right other than that was a pretty

420.639 --> 423.52
good show

421.36 --> 425.68
and even when it came off on afterward

423.52 --> 431.12
it was it was good

425.68 --> 433.36
uh yeah bible literally also went live

431.12 --> 435.12
it was good to be in there it's it's

433.36 --> 436.88
really fascinating

435.12 --> 439.52
i should have made more notes no more

436.88 --> 442.319
detail notes but

439.52 --> 443.44
i don't know didn't last that long and

442.319 --> 446.319
like bible literally

443.44 --> 447.599
always has such it's weird because in

446.319 --> 451.759
ways i get the feeling

447.599 --> 456.0
she does get esoteric it's like she is

451.759 --> 459.68
very careful with with her senses

456.0 --> 462.0
on top of all the exoteric puzzling of

459.68 --> 463.36
the the literal writings and all that

462.0 --> 467.12
and the word meaning

463.36 --> 469.599
so yeah it's always good to hear her

467.12 --> 472.24
and even though she has very she is kind

469.599 --> 473.44
of opinionated in certain ways she's

472.24 --> 476.479
very careful with but it's

473.44 --> 479.28
inevitable you always it just happens

476.479 --> 481.75899999999996
it happens i am opinionated in my own

479.28 --> 484.31899999999996
way as well

481.759 --> 485.44
right but it's very interesting to

484.319 --> 488.72
listen

485.44 --> 489.52
to some things she has to say especially

488.72 --> 492.96000000000004
here because

489.52 --> 496.15999999999997
it basically was telling me yeah

492.96 --> 499.19899999999996
it's all very nice when things are

496.16 --> 501.91900000000004
said and done based on scripture but

499.199 --> 503.91900000000004
if you don't understand the essence of

501.919 --> 506.4
it

503.919 --> 508.0
then it's going to be a mock-up and

506.4 --> 511.039
you're not gonna get

508.0 --> 513.44
what is basically thought you were

511.039 --> 515.1999999999999
because you're not doing it right that's

513.44 --> 516.8800000000001
what i got out of it and that made me

515.2 --> 519.839
just say yeah yeah

516.88 --> 522.0
esoterism for the win because that's

519.839 --> 524.32
really what it comes down to

522.0 --> 525.44
it's comes down to that you just have to

524.32 --> 527.2
get it

525.44 --> 528.5600000000001
and if you don't get it you got a

527.2 --> 531.36
problem

528.56 --> 532.0799999999999
if you don't learn how to get it then

531.36 --> 536.32
you will

532.08 --> 539.6800000000001
retain that problem and it will form you

536.32 --> 541.7600000000001
right so yeah it was pretty pretty good

539.68 --> 544.2399999999999
stuff

541.76 --> 545.6
and also of course every time i see that

544.24 --> 547.76
such things it's always

545.6 --> 549.519
a mirror right back to me because i have

547.76 --> 554.3199999999999
problems i've had

549.519 --> 554.32
long-term problems with society and

554.56 --> 560.0
like social social attitude issues

557.839 --> 561.0400000000001
and yeah that has shaped me and i

560.0 --> 563.44
realized that and i'm

561.04 --> 566.3199999999999
always trying to figure out like is

563.44 --> 568.32
there a way for me to get

566.32 --> 570.08
to the other side of the fence where the

568.32 --> 572.48
grass is greener is there even a

570.08 --> 573.279
possibility left for me am i supposed to

572.48 --> 575.04
do that

573.279 --> 576.72
am i supposed to try to break out of

575.04 --> 580.24
this when i've

576.72 --> 580.8000000000001
basically settled with it and kind of

580.24 --> 583.839
have

580.8 --> 586.7199999999999
used the unique traits of the position

583.839 --> 588.24
in order to kind of perfect what i do it

586.72 --> 591.279
is true i've

588.24 --> 594.0
always learned to use every mistake as

591.279 --> 598.32
an opportunity every

594.0 --> 601.519
defeat as a new

598.32 --> 601.519
opportunity as well

601.92 --> 605.92
like even personal defeat with my own

604.399 --> 609.44
challenges for example

605.92 --> 614.16
because i have had just massive defeats

609.44 --> 617.2790000000001
massive defeats ego crushing situations

614.16 --> 619.36
i don't care to share and others would

617.279 --> 619.8389999999999
probably not even feel it to that extent

619.36 --> 623.12
but i

619.839 --> 626.72
did because oh my god i take things so

623.12 --> 628.399
freaking seriously it's insane

626.72 --> 630.1600000000001
it's just this comes with the

628.399 --> 633.68
sensitivity

630.16 --> 637.1999999999999
anyway that was good stuff uh

633.68 --> 638.0
after that also during after i don't

637.2 --> 641.6800000000001
know

638.0 --> 643.839
like glow busters that was a good

641.68 --> 646.7199999999999
episode this time

643.839 --> 648.48
followed it through the live not not

646.72 --> 651.6
throughout the entire thing but

648.48 --> 653.36
big chunk of it uh

651.6 --> 655.12
and after that i just start kind of

653.36 --> 657.36
watching silly movies

655.12 --> 659.04
so the videos that i have many times

657.36 --> 660.8000000000001
before and it was interesting again

659.04 --> 662.24
because despite the videos being kind of

660.8 --> 664.4799999999999
silly

662.24 --> 666.48
it fascinates me that really no matter

664.48 --> 669.6800000000001
what if there is some kind of creativity

666.48 --> 669.6800000000001
going on with people

669.839 --> 673.7600000000001
if you watch it again after like long

673.12 --> 676.48
period

673.76 --> 677.04
it's fascinating as a process because

676.48 --> 679.36
sadly

677.04 --> 680.48
to me watching these videos that i've

679.36 --> 683.2
watched throughout

680.48 --> 683.6
many different times like also when i

683.2 --> 685.519
was

683.6 --> 686.72
really depressed or when i was really

685.519 --> 688.399
lost

686.72 --> 690.32
would watch these videos have a certain

688.399 --> 692.16
response now i'm watching it i'm not

690.32 --> 694.5600000000001
like that

692.16 --> 695.68
it's more like i'm kind of bored and

694.56 --> 697.5189999999999
restless a bit

695.68 --> 699.68
but i can't figure out what to do

697.519 --> 702.32
creatively so i kind of like

699.68 --> 704.56
yeah waste my time a little but it's fun

702.32 --> 706.1600000000001
to watch this stuff and then suddenly as

704.56 --> 708.4799999999999
i watch it

706.16 --> 709.1999999999999
it's like i'm watching those other times

708.48 --> 711.6800000000001
as well

709.2 --> 713.44
it's like i'm looking out through time

711.68 --> 715.3599999999999
through these videos through every time

713.44 --> 717.6800000000001
i've watched them

715.36 --> 718.5600000000001
and i have this spectrum of me watching

717.68 --> 722.6389999999999
it it's

718.56 --> 726.079
yeah trippy does doesn't it sound trippy

722.639 --> 727.04
but yeah it's it's not like

726.079 --> 730.56
hallucination

727.04 --> 732.3199999999999
indeed it's but it yeah see everything

730.56 --> 732.959
it doesn't matter what you do you can

732.32 --> 736.1600000000001
always

732.959 --> 738.16
find something even at first when it

736.16 --> 740.3199999999999
seems completely

738.16 --> 742.3199999999999
a waste of time eventually you can

740.32 --> 745.6800000000001
figure out

742.32 --> 748.1600000000001
why what that moment meant in the

745.68 --> 749.519
larger scheme of things and for example

748.16 --> 755.12
why it couldn't have been

749.519 --> 759.2
any other way that sort of thing

755.12 --> 760.9590000000001
or like if that hadn't happened then

759.2 --> 762.48
certain things right after that might

760.959 --> 765.4399999999999
not have happened leading to

762.48 --> 767.519
where i am now i've often wondered like

765.44 --> 769.36
what would have happened if

767.519 --> 771.36
things were if i made a lot of different

769.36 --> 773.76
decisions again i kind of addressed this

771.36 --> 775.6800000000001
yesterday too

773.76 --> 776.8
and i would have never come to that

775.68 --> 779.8389999999999
point i would have been too

776.8 --> 782.639
busy to ever even get into the flat

779.839 --> 782.639
earth on youtube

783.2 --> 787.279
and i would never be able to get over

785.2 --> 788.88
that threshold because i was too

787.279 --> 792.639
comfortable having a life

788.88 --> 794.88
basically um yeah with

792.639 --> 796.24
wife and kids for example i just wanted

794.88 --> 799.4399999999999
that it really

796.24 --> 800.639
makes me think that there could have

799.44 --> 802.72
been

800.639 --> 803.92
like an unfolding of my life that it

802.72 --> 806.88
would have led to me

803.92 --> 806.88
not doing this

807.12 --> 815.839
it it was it's almost unlikely that i've

811.2 --> 815.839
even ended up in this position

822.66 --> 825.7199999999999
[Music]

828.52 --> 834.24
[Music]

831.04 --> 836.0
yeah i have 10 of the same but for the

834.24 --> 840.16
record this is not a shirt

836.0 --> 843.839
it's a sweater that's three stop motion

840.16 --> 843.8389999999999
hello by the way patricia dockery

848.27 --> 851.39
[Music]

851.519 --> 858.639
tom parker

856.399 --> 858.639
right

861.12 --> 865.839
so yeah that was pretty much it for what

864.24 --> 869.76
i did yesterday

865.839 --> 869.7600000000001
15 minutes roughly

883.199 --> 886.7199999999999
no no i don't

889.76 --> 894.24
are you going to keep asking me that

891.44 --> 896.1600000000001
because if you keep asking

894.24 --> 898.32
i will eventually ban you it's very

896.16 --> 899.68
annoying when people ask me to do things

898.32 --> 902.8000000000001
that i don't really

899.68 --> 904.6389999999999
want to or plan to do if you keep asking

902.8 --> 907.92
me that [ __ ] i'm gonna ban you

904.639 --> 907.92
because it's very annoying

908.0 --> 914.399
and so goes for the other non-relay

912.24 --> 915.519
to any of the subjects i deal with

914.399 --> 918.72
questions

915.519 --> 921.76
that you keep repeating in the last week

918.72 --> 925.279
i have three stop motion

921.76 --> 927.88
i appreciate the super chats but i don't

925.279 --> 931.199
appreciate the repetition of

927.88 --> 934.639
non-subject questions

931.199 --> 937.279
yeah we are cool but

934.639 --> 938.0790000000001
that doesn't mean that i can't be

937.279 --> 941.8389999999999
annoyed

938.079 --> 941.8389999999999
by certain traits

946.8 --> 953.3599999999999
this is not just some hanging group

950.72 --> 955.36
right irwin's place is not just for any

953.36 --> 956.9590000000001
random guys to just start hanging around

955.36 --> 959.6
and and basically

956.959 --> 961.04
acts out of boredom that's not what this

959.6 --> 963.759
place is about

961.04 --> 966.959
this is about thinking this is about

963.759 --> 969.1990000000001
technical subjects

966.959 --> 971.279
if you're not interested in that and you

969.199 --> 973.199
keep asking questions that have nothing

971.279 --> 976.959
to do with any of that

973.199 --> 976.959
then you are in the way

978.959 --> 997.8389999999999
all right here we go again

982.88 --> 997.8389999999999
you're doing it again

1003.12 --> 1010.9590000000001
all right good servant shouldn't do that

1006.88 --> 1014.399
when i'm addressing somebody tom parker

1010.959 --> 1014.399
yeah i don't care if you have to

1019.36 --> 1025.839
first and last warning next time at your

1022.839 --> 1025.839
wrench

1030.24 --> 1032.88
it yeah

1033.28 --> 1037.76
i was trying to kind of carefully

1035.679 --> 1041.2800000000002
discipline them and if you then step

1037.76 --> 1041.28
in like that you'll ruin it

1047.439 --> 1052.0800000000002
right but i do agree with the sentiment

1049.76 --> 1054.24
here i i do find it very annoying

1052.08 --> 1056.72
the the type of questions is just not

1054.24 --> 1061.1200000000001
related to anything

1056.72 --> 1064.48
like i i don't care for you to have a

1061.12 --> 1067.9189999999999
layout of all my physical actions

1064.48 --> 1071.1200000000001
in this world i'm not gonna tell you

1067.919 --> 1073.3600000000001
my life chart okay buddy it's none of

1071.12 --> 1076.9599999999998
your [ __ ] business

1073.36 --> 1079.4399999999998
i tell enough about what i do

1076.96 --> 1082.559
okay i'm already putting my life out

1079.44 --> 1082.559
there pretty much

1083.36 --> 1090.1599999999999
right my name my address

1087.6 --> 1091.039
most yeah most of the relevant history

1090.16 --> 1094.0800000000002
is pretty much

1091.039 --> 1097.12
public and i've shared many details

1094.08 --> 1100.8799999999999
about just my life what it's like

1097.12 --> 1103.52
but i focus on things

1100.88 --> 1104.0
that i think are relevant because just

1103.52 --> 1106.96
with

1104.0 --> 1108.72
the silly videos i'm not gonna yeah even

1106.96 --> 1111.2
though i really

1108.72 --> 1113.6000000000001
like the guy that does that [ __ ] has

1111.2 --> 1117.2
nothing to do with this really

1113.6 --> 1120.48
and it feels out of place it's

1117.2 --> 1124.0
so yeah i i might watch weird [ __ ]

1120.48 --> 1124.4
sometimes not not really non-logos but

1124.0 --> 1128.48
just

1124.4 --> 1132.0
kind of like very goofy or

1128.48 --> 1134.88
whatever maybe even like

1132.0 --> 1136.4
with creepy humor because i used to like

1134.88 --> 1138.0
that a lot

1136.4 --> 1140.0
up to a certain level not just

1138.0 --> 1142.4
disgusting but just creepy

1140.0 --> 1145.039
like weird and like overly frustrated

1142.4 --> 1146.799
humor i like that

1145.039 --> 1148.84
and this guy's really created it but it

1146.799 --> 1152.08
doesn't mean that i'm gonna bring it

1148.84 --> 1154.48
up and then talk about that no no i want

1152.08 --> 1156.1599999999999
to bring up subjects that i think

1154.48 --> 1157.919
have the right frequency and that you

1156.16 --> 1160.64
can learn something from

1157.919 --> 1161.6000000000001
and then i relay kind of what i learned

1160.64 --> 1164.88
from it

1161.6 --> 1165.52
and how and then i hope it rubs off on

1164.88 --> 1169.679
people

1165.52 --> 1173.039
if they think like hey i like that

1169.679 --> 1175.919
maybe i will do that that's

1173.039 --> 1178.4
that's the gist of it that's the basics

1175.919 --> 1180.0
that's how i'm trying to be persistently

1178.4 --> 1184.48
good

1180.0 --> 1184.48
it's not easy you know

1184.559 --> 1189.9189999999999
it's being myself but every part

1187.919 --> 1190.96
at least i'm trying to do something good

1189.919 --> 1193.44
with it

1190.96 --> 1194.96
because i'm not literally gonna

1193.44 --> 1199.1200000000001
basically give you

1194.96 --> 1201.8400000000001
my most haunting realizations

1199.12 --> 1203.84
like for my dark world that literally

1201.84 --> 1204.559
terrify the [ __ ] out of me something i'm

1203.84 --> 1207.1999999999998
not gonna

1204.559 --> 1208.3999999999999
give that here because what are you

1207.2 --> 1212.48
gonna do with that

1208.4 --> 1214.4
get all paranoid and scared shitless yay

1212.48 --> 1215.52
how useful no that's not gonna

1214.4 --> 1220.5590000000002
contribute anything

1215.52 --> 1220.8799999999999
see i have a mission here mission is to

1220.559 --> 1224.0
do

1220.88 --> 1226.3200000000002
good and to help the ascension in in the

1224.0 --> 1226.32
light

1227.2 --> 1230.48
because we need more of that the world

1229.44 --> 1234.96
is

1230.48 --> 1238.0
in my opinion seems to be falling apart

1234.96 --> 1242.159
and we need champions

1238.0 --> 1244.72
champions of the light desperately

1242.159 --> 1245.919
and there are many but we're still kind

1244.72 --> 1248.24
of timid we're still

1245.919 --> 1250.0
intimidated the ones that are out there

1248.24 --> 1252.0
and

1250.0 --> 1254.559
getting to that point where you can

1252.0 --> 1256.32
really break out and physically start to

1254.559 --> 1258.8799999999999
interact and build and stuff

1256.32 --> 1260.84
it's very it's for me very tough to move

1258.88 --> 1265.0390000000002
beyond just the verbal

1260.84 --> 1266.8799999999999
actions and i'm not the only one

1265.039 --> 1268.96
but i gotta start somewhere and i'm

1266.88 --> 1270.64
starting where my talent is blah blah

1268.96 --> 1272.559
blah blah blah blah blah just like in

1270.64 --> 1274.64
the past and in the past it was like oh

1272.559 --> 1275.76
god irwin can you please just shut up

1274.64 --> 1278.96
for a second

1275.76 --> 1280.64
to your crazy ideas and now

1278.96 --> 1282.4
i'm using that blah blah blah blah blah

1280.64 --> 1285.1200000000001
blah training

1282.4 --> 1286.5590000000002
to be fluent to be more focused in my

1285.12 --> 1290.08
mind in how i speak

1286.559 --> 1293.28
how i do things in techniques in

1290.08 --> 1296.0
history you know anything see so my

1293.28 --> 1297.84
annoying trade in the past turned out to

1296.0 --> 1300.48
be connected to quite some

1297.84 --> 1302.9599999999998
growing space in my head and now i've

1300.48 --> 1302.96
become

1303.039 --> 1309.28
uh yeah something else

1306.24 --> 1310.4
instead of blabler maybe bit more of a

1309.28 --> 1312.96
wizard

1310.4 --> 1314.0800000000002
might i try to be a wizard of the light

1312.96 --> 1317.52
you know

1314.08 --> 1320.0
although i do get goofy sometimes but

1317.52 --> 1322.0
people get really confused or

1320.0 --> 1324.08
misunderstand or scared

1322.0 --> 1325.76
i will immediately snap out of it and

1324.08 --> 1327.9189999999999
try to

1325.76 --> 1329.2
set mistakes right misunderstandings

1327.919 --> 1332.24
right

1329.2 --> 1336.64
i'm not devious

1332.24 --> 1336.64
so yeah this is what i am

1341.919 --> 1347.679
yeah yes tiny bombo that's correct but

1343.919 --> 1350.96
the thing is with trolls

1347.679 --> 1354.24
often they don't really go away

1350.96 --> 1358.64
so if you just start to mute them

1354.24 --> 1361.84
when they still have halfway decent

1358.64 --> 1365.039
frequencies halfway then they're

1361.84 --> 1367.6789999999999
usually either just gonna go away and

1365.039 --> 1369.84
not have a good impression and resonate

1367.679 --> 1371.6000000000001
that off to the outside world or

1369.84 --> 1373.28
because you just rejected them when they

1371.6 --> 1376.8799999999999
still had halfway things

1373.28 --> 1378.3999999999999
to actually share or they turn into fall

1376.88 --> 1378.88
trolls and then you got that on their

1378.4 --> 1381.919
hands and

1378.88 --> 1382.48
stupid socks and all that so that's why

1381.919 --> 1384.5590000000002
i

1382.48 --> 1386.96
take a new approach in relation to the

1384.559 --> 1390.24
past when i did just ram them out

1386.96 --> 1392.48
and it was a lot of fun and i still will

1390.24 --> 1392.88
with the absolute squirted trolls which

1392.48 --> 1395.84
i

1392.88 --> 1396.96
recognize you know because they don't

1395.84 --> 1399.4399999999998
have halfway

1396.96 --> 1400.4
decent frequencies but if i do it with

1399.44 --> 1402.88
everyone

1400.4 --> 1405.2
then the amount of nasty trolls will

1402.88 --> 1407.7600000000002
only increase over time so i'm basically

1405.2 --> 1407.76
trying to

1408.48 --> 1417.84
get the troll problem under control

1412.32 --> 1417.84
under control yeah

1428.0 --> 1432.159
mission immersible fallout what

1440.72 --> 1448.64
all right see so it just goes to show

1444.72 --> 1451.2
nothing i do is without thought

1448.64 --> 1451.76
and the thinking kind of subconsciously

1451.2 --> 1455.279
even

1451.76 --> 1457.6
goes ahead of my actions because

1455.279 --> 1459.679
my time-based experience seems to be

1457.6 --> 1461.76
kind of compartmentalized

1459.679 --> 1463.679
it's very handy especially when i'm on

1461.76 --> 1465.279
the road in a car behind the steering

1463.679 --> 1467.3600000000001
wheel because i literally see

1465.279 --> 1469.6
[ __ ] coming ahead of time and then can

1467.36 --> 1473.6
adapt to it that's why i

1469.6 --> 1477.039
never ever have gotten into an accident

1473.6 --> 1477.039
have avoided many

1481.279 --> 1500.48
how old am i i'm 40 currently

1484.96 --> 1503.919
manual avilis

1500.48 --> 1508.96
all right cheers with a beer

1503.919 --> 1508.96
you from the uh from australia

1511.279 --> 1517.36
because yeah

1514.4 --> 1518.48
the other regions is usually a little uh

1517.36 --> 1529.279
early to

1518.48 --> 1531.919
start with a beer

1529.279 --> 1533.67
oh not drinking atomizers all right well

1531.919 --> 1538.009
cheers

1533.67 --> 1538.009
[Music]

1541.2 --> 1546.0800000000002
how you reach flow state well yeah

1543.52 --> 1548.0
patricia dockery that is how you do it

1546.08 --> 1549.84
it's basically surrendering the

1548.0 --> 1554.48
conscious control

1549.84 --> 1557.4399999999998
of parts of your mechanism letting them

1554.48 --> 1558.64
move out of your conscious side it is

1557.44 --> 1561.6000000000001
yeah as i called it i

1558.64 --> 1562.159
called that out a few days ago on the

1561.6 --> 1565.279
show

1562.159 --> 1566.88
well then again because i used to have

1565.279 --> 1570.799
that problem my consciousness

1566.88 --> 1573.679
wanted me to consciously do everything

1570.799 --> 1574.24
that only made it fail it was a big

1573.679 --> 1576.64
problem

1574.24 --> 1577.84
for me throughout my youth made me feel

1576.64 --> 1581.2
like a failure because i could

1577.84 --> 1585.12
constantly conceive of how to do things

1581.2 --> 1588.96
but then i wasn't able to actually do it

1585.12 --> 1591.12
made me feel incredibly useless

1588.96 --> 1593.6000000000001
and like i was being tortured by my

1591.12 --> 1596.559
fantasy

1593.6 --> 1597.52
terrible but i've learned to basically

1596.559 --> 1601.36
yeah let go

1597.52 --> 1602.72
letting go is such a huge issue for my

1601.36 --> 1605.76
consciousness

1602.72 --> 1606.88
for my that specific part because it's

1605.76 --> 1610.0
very

1606.88 --> 1611.279
it's my consciousness is intense and i

1610.0 --> 1613.919
use it to basically

1611.279 --> 1614.32
yeah don't don't take it creepy but i

1613.919 --> 1616.3200000000002
can

1614.32 --> 1617.84
use it to literally just gaze in

1616.32 --> 1621.36
people's

1617.84 --> 1625.6789999999999
frequencies and minds even i can just

1621.36 --> 1628.08
quickly take a look and figure out

1625.679 --> 1629.6000000000001
roughly who they are and now of course

1628.08 --> 1630.08
there's a lot of people that have this

1629.6 --> 1633.4399999999998
skill

1630.08 --> 1635.6789999999999
and they use it automated well i haven't

1633.44 --> 1638.48
gotten to that part yet

1635.679 --> 1641.76
right right because i'm not fully

1638.48 --> 1646.0
engaged yet i'm still kind of socially

1641.76 --> 1649.279
awkward but because of that

1646.0 --> 1652.48
i develop this ability

1649.279 --> 1653.84
to from a distant stare in people it's

1652.48 --> 1657.679
because i'm

1653.84 --> 1659.84
not automating it because i'm not really

1657.679 --> 1661.52
socially capable like that anymore i

1659.84 --> 1663.36
think although i've considered

1661.52 --> 1665.279
just i said in the start of the show i

1663.36 --> 1668.08
might be able to at some point but

1665.279 --> 1669.919
can i should i go over that fence where

1668.08 --> 1672.96
the grass is greener on the other side

1669.919 --> 1674.3990000000001
should i i don't know but because i

1672.96 --> 1677.919
didn't

1674.399 --> 1682.0
suddenly my let's just

1677.919 --> 1684.159
continue this symbology my collar senses

1682.0 --> 1685.6
of that green grass on the other side

1684.159 --> 1688.48
have amplified

1685.6 --> 1690.32
greatly so now i can see exactly how

1688.48 --> 1691.039
green that grass is on the other side

1690.32 --> 1694.8799999999999
see

1691.039 --> 1694.8799999999999
that's technically what's happened to me

1694.96 --> 1700.48
see so with that inability

1698.399 --> 1703.84
another sense has kind of developed you

1700.48 --> 1706.32
could very well compare this to people

1703.84 --> 1707.76
that are blinded especially young or

1706.32 --> 1710.399
that are born blind

1707.76 --> 1711.2
they develop their sensories in another

1710.399 --> 1714.7199999999998
way

1711.2 --> 1717.8400000000001
because they're blinded well i'm sort of

1714.72 --> 1719.76
socially slightly blinded or short

1717.84 --> 1721.52
socially short-sighted let's just call

1719.76 --> 1725.6
it that socially i'm socially

1721.52 --> 1728.799
short-sighted i'm not that good

1725.6 --> 1733.9189999999999
but because that i have

1728.799 --> 1733.9189999999999
amazing social analytics skills instead

1736.84 --> 1739.84
see

1740.44 --> 1743.92
[Music]

1744.08 --> 1748.72
so yeah maybe you people out there

1746.72 --> 1750.799
everyone and people in chat too maybe

1748.72 --> 1752.88
you can figure out look i have

1750.799 --> 1754.559
issues i have certain things i can't do

1752.88 --> 1757.1200000000001
very frustrated about it

1754.559 --> 1758.72
it's just how things that happen

1757.12 --> 1762.6399999999999
accidents or anything or

1758.72 --> 1765.44
trauma and now i'm like this so

1762.64 --> 1766.159
can you figure out what kind of the

1765.44 --> 1769.279
benefit

1766.159 --> 1769.8400000000001
is of being like that versus when you

1769.279 --> 1772.159
wouldn't

1769.84 --> 1773.4399999999998
have been like that can you figure out

1772.159 --> 1777.1200000000001
what special skill

1773.44 --> 1780.3200000000002
came on top of

1777.12 --> 1781.52
the flaws you had can you figure that

1780.32 --> 1784.72
out

1781.52 --> 1789.6
if you can then maybe two

1784.72 --> 1792.32
you too can find peace with your flaws

1789.6 --> 1793.12
because of the skills you've realized

1792.32 --> 1796.399
it's kind of

1793.12 --> 1798.2399999999998
the reward of god you might consider it

1796.399 --> 1799.76
like maybe you can figure out what this

1798.24 --> 1802.0
exact

1799.76 --> 1803.76
because it is exact in you in your

1802.0 --> 1807.039
dealings what

1803.76 --> 1808.0
special skill have you within your range

1807.039 --> 1810.72
or have you already

1808.0 --> 1811.6
started developing or have you developed

1810.72 --> 1823.1200000000001
because

1811.6 --> 1826.559
of your flaws realize this

1823.12 --> 1826.559
cbt what is that

1828.4 --> 1831.529
[Music]

1833.2 --> 1836.24
yes patricia dockery brilliant

1835.36 --> 1839.12
frustration

1836.24 --> 1841.36
and anxiety act like exit ramps that's

1839.12 --> 1842.9599999999998
exactly what they do they give you the

1841.36 --> 1847.12
way out

1842.96 --> 1850.559
just get out they you want to get out

1847.12 --> 1853.6789999999999
and then yeah you surrender

1850.559 --> 1855.2
you surrender to the situation to your

1853.679 --> 1858.3200000000002
inability

1855.2 --> 1858.32
to fix it

1861.279 --> 1865.44
if you give into it and that can be

1864.24 --> 1867.6
through squirting

1865.44 --> 1869.279
losing your focus losing your energy if

1867.6 --> 1871.039
you're ever acting out or

1869.279 --> 1872.399
literally squirting you know porn and

1871.039 --> 1875.6
[ __ ]

1872.399 --> 1878.4799999999998
like owen benjamin says and that

1875.6 --> 1880.7199999999998
causes you to lose further grip over the

1878.48 --> 1884.72
situation and kind of forget about it

1880.72 --> 1884.72
so yes that's exactly what that is

1889.49 --> 1894.32
[Music]

1890.96 --> 1897.919
cognitive behavioral therapy all right

1894.32 --> 1897.9189999999999
ambo interesting

1898.08 --> 1905.519
well for me this is this is a lot

1901.84 --> 1909.039
of yeah these are the mechanics

1905.519 --> 1911.279
my consciousness deals with with

1909.039 --> 1912.8799999999999
constantly or a lot of the time

1911.279 --> 1915.039
especially when i'm very much in the

1912.88 --> 1918.64
mood for it it's not always

1915.039 --> 1921.039
now i'm seem to be very much in there

1918.64 --> 1922.5590000000002
and the funny thing is i've never read

1921.039 --> 1926.08
any books of this stuff

1922.559 --> 1927.6789999999999
ever i literally figured all of this out

1926.08 --> 1930.32
from scratch

1927.679 --> 1932.3990000000001
now i've had heard things i've had

1930.32 --> 1933.279
things explained to me for example about

1932.399 --> 1934.8799999999999
this sort of thing

1933.279 --> 1936.64
people would say you know this and this

1934.88 --> 1937.0390000000002
technique you do this you do that you do

1936.64 --> 1940.5590000000002
that

1937.039 --> 1942.799
and i'm like okay i think i get what's

1940.559 --> 1945.2
going on here

1942.799 --> 1945.9189999999999
but i've never literally said oh my god

1945.2 --> 1948.3990000000001
that is it

1945.919 --> 1950.96
i am going to memorize this because i

1948.399 --> 1954.32
don't memorize things like that

1950.96 --> 1955.2
if it sticks it sticks that's my persist

1954.32 --> 1958.6399999999999
i don't

1955.2 --> 1962.0800000000002
etch things into my mind i need

1958.64 --> 1965.44
that space to be fluid

1962.08 --> 1967.76
so i've basically just used

1965.44 --> 1968.88
the essence of a lot of things and then

1967.76 --> 1972.08
constructed it

1968.88 --> 1974.8400000000001
bottom up from my own

1972.08 --> 1976.8799999999999
essence from my own heart from my own

1974.84 --> 1978.6399999999999
consciousness wherever that's coming

1976.88 --> 1981.8400000000001
from

1978.64 --> 1984.72
from god hopefully so that's

1981.84 --> 1986.6399999999999
how i've learned a lot i think so yeah

1984.72 --> 1987.84
i'm not surprised if a lot of things

1986.64 --> 1989.919
that i'm just saying

1987.84 --> 1991.1999999999998
reflects in other people's minds on

1989.919 --> 1992.96
things they've read

1991.2 --> 1994.96
because like yeah it is kind of like

1992.96 --> 2004.159
that but i've never read those books

1994.96 --> 2008.159
i promise you weird isn't it

2004.159 --> 2008.159
low zinc can also cause problems

2009.44 --> 2019.8400000000001
sure well i have zinc

2013.44 --> 2019.8400000000001
i have seeking supplements

2024.159 --> 2028.0900000000001
i learned from flaws giving advice to

2026.399 --> 2029.4399999999998
people is condensating

2028.09 --> 2033.76
[Music]

2029.44 --> 2036.0800000000002
i don't have this 160 iq

2033.76 --> 2038.24
in fact apparently middling tend to

2036.08 --> 2039.6
fantasize about being extremely gifted

2038.24 --> 2043.84
people are selfish

2039.6 --> 2043.84
and planets aren't flat

2044.84 --> 2047.84
okay

2048.159 --> 2051.44
that's okay

2053.679 --> 2057.359
you fantasize about being extremely

2056.0 --> 2059.119
gifted

2057.359 --> 2062.3199999999997
well have you ever considered

2059.119 --> 2066.32
fantasizing about

2062.32 --> 2068.0
gifts that you could actually attain

2066.32 --> 2070.32
have you ever fantasized about that

2068.0 --> 2072.079
because oh yeah i fantasized about a lot

2070.32 --> 2075.52
of things

2072.079 --> 2079.599
dude you have any idea how much i would

2075.52 --> 2079.599
like to be able to physically fly

2080.48 --> 2083.919
to attain that ability because i've

2082.32 --> 2086.48
dreamt exactly

2083.919 --> 2087.2799999999997
how that works i can like i know how to

2086.48 --> 2090.879
steer it

2087.28 --> 2093.3590000000004
i'm like a flying master

2090.879 --> 2095.44
in my dreams when that arrives it

2093.359 --> 2097.359
doesn't really do that a lot anymore

2095.44 --> 2099.44
when it does i'm so good at i can

2097.359 --> 2100.64
literally just stick myself to the

2099.44 --> 2103.92
ceiling

2100.64 --> 2106.8799999999997
or like hover a few inches over

2103.92 --> 2108.7200000000003
the streets that can do the most weird

2106.88 --> 2109.52
maneuvers you can think yeah i want to

2108.72 --> 2112.0789999999997
do that

2109.52 --> 2113.599
but guess what it's not really

2112.079 --> 2116.4
attainable my own

2113.599 --> 2118.56
physical ability and i've just realized

2116.4 --> 2122.4
that that yeah you can fantasize

2118.56 --> 2125.599
about having super powers but

2122.4 --> 2128.64
why would you when you could potentially

2125.599 --> 2130.48
get seeming superpowers that

2128.64 --> 2132.0
are actually within a reach why don't

2130.48 --> 2133.76
you fantasize about that that's what

2132.0 --> 2137.52
i've been doing and guess what

2133.76 --> 2139.0
i got freaking amazing stuff

2137.52 --> 2142.079
available to me

2139.0 --> 2145.44
[Laughter]

2142.079 --> 2147.119
so that's what i've done because just

2145.44 --> 2149.28
fantasizing about things you can never

2147.119 --> 2151.92
get

2149.28 --> 2159.8390000000004
makes you sad it makes you feel like

2151.92 --> 2159.839
you're not competent

2163.92 --> 2167.359
time to clean up the house i live and

2166.16 --> 2170.64
purchase

2167.359 --> 2173.839
all right nice oh what

2170.64 --> 2173.839
oh thanks

2174.8 --> 2177.119

2188.8 --> 2191.28
sorry

2192.079 --> 2196.5600000000004
am i being condescending i'm just giving

2194.48 --> 2199.119
out general advice and since you

2196.56 --> 2200.4
kind of answered the thing the

2199.119 --> 2202.4
suggestion

2200.4 --> 2203.6800000000003
i was just responding in a generalized

2202.4 --> 2207.44
way i have

2203.68 --> 2207.44
i didn't mean to be condescending

2209.119 --> 2213.52
no because yeah but the hasten slowly is

2211.2 --> 2216.56
a pretty interesting commenter so

2213.52 --> 2218.64

2216.56 --> 2229.839
got to him in a wrong way i didn't mean

know because the [ __ ] has happened to me

2277.44 --> 2280.0
in the past

2280.17 --> 2284.88

2342.4 --> 2347.04
laughed my ass off

2343.599 --> 2349.3590000000004
over a video that's like super

2347.04 --> 2350.079
unknown and super niche nobody's ever

2349.359 --> 2352.0
heard of that

2350.079 --> 2353.119
about the channel that i basically

2352.0 --> 2356.64
explained about early

2353.119 --> 2359.44
silly videos there's a reviewer

2356.64 --> 2361.359
that i don't even share the name of that

2359.44 --> 2362.7200000000003
i don't share links of and i watched

2361.359 --> 2366.48
that video yesterday

2362.72 --> 2369.5989999999997
of a director called lamell who's like

2366.48 --> 2372.96
hilarious and [ __ ] insane right so

2369.599 --> 2376.56
this is just like what the [ __ ]

2372.96 --> 2380.48
what the [ __ ] why is this name appearing

2376.56 --> 2380.48
in my chat that's just too weird man

2380.88 --> 2384.48
but anyway he apologized for saying

2383.28 --> 2387.28
gravity is not a force

2384.48 --> 2389.76
that is hilarious and absolutely

2387.28 --> 2396.2400000000002
[ __ ]

2389.76 --> 2398.7200000000003
you know yes really

2396.24 --> 2400.72
so that you why are you called lamel

2398.72 --> 2404.0789999999997
forever

2400.72 --> 2411.839
it's too weird why how did you came to

2404.079 --> 2411.8390000000004
that name

2416.4 --> 2425.839
someone is spamming no how did you come

2419.04 --> 2425.839
to that name

2426.48 --> 2429.28
where did you get it

2431.52 --> 2439.839
i want to know

2450.839 --> 2453.839
really

2454.88 --> 2459.599
right okay okay

2459.76 --> 2465.28
that's that's uncanny

2463.04 --> 2467.359
because i've never even heard that name

2465.28 --> 2470.079
before anywhere

2467.359 --> 2472.72
besides that freaking director never

2470.079 --> 2474.7200000000003
heard that name anywhere ever before

2472.72 --> 2476.8799999999997
and watched that video yesterday and now

2474.72 --> 2481.839
you appear in my chat

2476.88 --> 2481.839
like who did that

2484.319 --> 2495.839
director of really stupid horror movies

2487.599 --> 2495.839
in the 80s

2498.96 --> 2502.48
it's it's so niche

2502.56 --> 2508.0
yeah lamell yeah it i know it

2505.599 --> 2510.2400000000002
it's not relevant i'm just freaked out

2508.0 --> 2512.64
by just the synchronicity here like what

2510.24 --> 2512.64
the [ __ ]

2514.96 --> 2518.8
how did you find this channel email yeah

2516.96 --> 2521.68
that's a good question how

2518.8 --> 2522.0
are seems like the ai might be keeping

2521.68 --> 2524.64
track

2522.0 --> 2526.24
and just playing around saying like oh

2524.64 --> 2529.92
he watched a video with

2526.24 --> 2531.2
la mao oh let's see is there any lamel

2529.92 --> 2537.839
out there

2531.2 --> 2537.839
let's point him to my channel what

2540.16 --> 2551.839
but yeah how did you find this channel

2544.0 --> 2551.839
yeah you're real that's that's okay

2556.24 --> 2559.7599999999998
yeah synchronicities might not have an

2558.48 --> 2565.68
explanation that

2559.76 --> 2568.48
doesn't mean that i can investigate

2565.68 --> 2568.48
hey miss kang

2573.04 --> 2580.48
i watch you nathan's okay

2576.24 --> 2583.04
so just today you decided to pop over

2580.48 --> 2584.72
okay all right well at least it's not

2583.04 --> 2586.96
that a random uh

2584.72 --> 2589.04
thing it's just the time it's still

2586.96 --> 2593.839
weird weird enough for me

2589.04 --> 2593.839
but anyway let's move on

2598.96 --> 2604.319
yeah when you watch things you get a lot

2601.76 --> 2606.96
more suggested that's right

2604.319 --> 2609.44
you're not your first time here really i

2606.96 --> 2613.04
must have been very busy talking and

2609.44 --> 2615.2000000000003
look overlooked you anyway this is weird

2613.04 --> 2617.599
maybe your name just didn't stand out to

2615.2 --> 2621.839
me it's only now

2617.599 --> 2621.839
because i watched it

2624.48 --> 2637.119
right anyway yeah welcome to the stream

2634.0 --> 2640.16
oh by the way if you watched nathan's

2637.119 --> 2649.839
did you watch yesterday's restream in

2640.16 --> 2649.839
the premiere

2650.72 --> 2663.839
all right watch the part where nathan

2654.64 --> 2663.839
tried to straw man me

2666.96 --> 2670.8
right forever conscious research channel

2669.76 --> 2677.8390000000004
okey dokey

2670.8 --> 2677.8390000000004
all right never mind then

2682.48 --> 2688.839
maybe you watch was he here yesterday

2685.76 --> 2690.48
that's that's interesting ambo i like

2688.839 --> 2693.92
that

2690.48 --> 2697.599
but on the other hand i didn't specif

2693.92 --> 2699.599
didn't specifically click on that video

2697.599 --> 2700.8
because of the name i didn't search it

2699.599 --> 2703.92
up right

2700.8 --> 2704.6400000000003
i just scrolled through the list like he

2703.92 --> 2707.52
has like

2704.64 --> 2708.56
five years of weekly silly videos it's

2707.52 --> 2711.7599999999998
incredible

2708.56 --> 2714.7999999999997
incredible man that guy and i

2711.76 --> 2716.8
just i'm so yeah and he's pretty

2714.8 --> 2719.8390000000004
hardcore because he even does it like in

2716.8 --> 2719.8390000000004
the middle of moving

2720.96 --> 2725.2
but yeah i just happened to watch that

2722.88 --> 2727.599
because i remember it was so incredibly

2725.2 --> 2727.5989999999997
silly

2728.319 --> 2732.0
and then i watched it again and then

2730.24 --> 2734.72
really shocked shocked about

2732.0 --> 2736.0
how silly it actually is it's just

2734.72 --> 2738.0789999999997
unbelievably dumb

2736.0 --> 2740.319
and silly but just so dumb and silly

2738.079 --> 2744.88
it's it's funny again

2740.319 --> 2749.52
but anyway straw menu on what

2744.88 --> 2753.76
i'm not a youtuber no not you nathan

2749.52 --> 2756.319
with uh yeah it kind of resolved

2753.76 --> 2758.96
and but yeah i talked about it at the

2756.319 --> 2761.2
beginning of this show

2758.96 --> 2762.56
so like pretty much at this at the

2761.2 --> 2764.96
straight start so

2762.56 --> 2766.72
you can watch that back if you want i'm

2764.96 --> 2769.119
not going to repeat all of it

2766.72 --> 2771.839
i've only got 15 more minutes for the

2769.119 --> 2771.839
rest of the show

2773.44 --> 2775.839
uh

2780.48 --> 2783.52
right anyway

2785.04 --> 2789.839
anything else

2791.839 --> 2799.96
anything you guys wanted me to address

2796.4 --> 2801.44
gravity is a conspiracy theory

2799.96 --> 2804.319
[Music]

2801.44 --> 2804.96
not a way for the man to keep you down

2804.319 --> 2809.2799999999997
okay

2804.96 --> 2814.56
well sort of it's

2809.28 --> 2814.5600000000004
an aberration in my technical opinion

2814.72 --> 2819.52
and it is an oversimplification and a

2816.88 --> 2825.359
cover and thereby a reification

2819.52 --> 2825.359
also so yeah it's kind of

2826.64 --> 2830.7999999999997
it's like a priesthood knowledge cover

2829.68 --> 2833.44
it's a spell

2830.8 --> 2835.119
to satisfy the masses it's easy to latch

2833.44 --> 2837.28
onto they will be satisfied they will

2835.119 --> 2840.7200000000003
not inquire further

2837.28 --> 2843.6800000000003
that's it it's a priest

2840.72 --> 2846.16
story system in this case it's in the

2843.68 --> 2848.24
mechanics their priesthood their priest

2846.16 --> 2849.92
wizardry lies in the mechanics

2848.24 --> 2851.7599999999998
explanation

2849.92 --> 2853.54
see that's where they did their tricks

2851.76 --> 2856.0
that's their

2853.54 --> 2858.8
[Music]

2856.0 --> 2859.68
yeah their spell their they're yeah

2858.8 --> 2862.96
religious

2859.68 --> 2865.2
scription for the public

2862.96 --> 2865.2
see

2868.4 --> 2873.28
to control the information you have to

2870.72 --> 2876.24
obscure it and then replace it

2873.28 --> 2878.7200000000003
by something that'll lead people to

2876.24 --> 2880.8799999999997
believe it's real enough

2878.72 --> 2883.2
but if they inquire further to a dead

2880.88 --> 2883.2000000000003
end

2883.359 --> 2886.64
and the further inquiry should generally

2886.319 --> 2890.64
be

2886.64 --> 2901.839
avoided using peer pressure

2890.64 --> 2901.839
that's the system

2902.88 --> 2905.92
what is gravity

2906.0 --> 2909.04
gravity is a reification fallacy

2907.839 --> 2911.359
replacement for

2909.04 --> 2912.839
relative density because relative

2911.359 --> 2916.319
density is

2912.839 --> 2919.44
absolutely provable and repeatable

2916.319 --> 2919.44
scientific fact

2919.71 --> 2922.869
[Music]

2924.079 --> 2927.8390000000004
but yeah because of the mechanics of

2925.92 --> 2930.2000000000003
gravity

2927.839 --> 2931.599
can when drawing in other

2930.2 --> 2933.1189999999997
presuppositions

2931.599 --> 2934.88
like the earth being a sphere and there

2933.119 --> 2937.119
being an outer space vacuum and the

2934.88 --> 2939.839
lights being literal

2937.119 --> 2940.8
physical bodies well then the gravity

2939.839 --> 2943.7599999999998
assumption

2940.8 --> 2945.6800000000003
can help you explain the dynamics and

2943.76 --> 2947.3590000000004
the mechanics of how that's all supposed

2945.68 --> 2951.2799999999997
to hang together

2947.359 --> 2953.7599999999998
that's why they did that that's why they

2951.28 --> 2956.2400000000002
where they lent it from relative density

2953.76 --> 2960.0
to basically

2956.24 --> 2962.0
yeah turn it into a fundamental force

2960.0 --> 2964.24
literally in this case a fundamental

2962.0 --> 2965.76
force well literally or not literally

2964.24 --> 2969.2
anymore through einstein but

2965.76 --> 2972.3190000000004
yeah technically

2969.2 --> 2973.4399999999996
symbolically a force that keeps it all

2972.319 --> 2976.8
together

2973.44 --> 2980.64
that's what it is that's why it's there

2976.8 --> 2982.8
fortunately it's still super super messy

2980.64 --> 2984.24
so they had to invent like dark matter

2982.8 --> 2987.44
and all that

2984.24 --> 2990.9599999999996
to basically even it out

2987.44 --> 2999.839
because it's all just very messy

2990.96 --> 2999.839
the whole conception

3010.559 --> 3014.3190000000004
all right and paul but there's also

3013.28 --> 3017.52
people that are

3014.319 --> 3020.079
well sort of fat but that have no

3017.52 --> 3021.28
trouble at all because they have the

3020.079 --> 3024.319
correlating

3021.28 --> 3025.44
sufficient amount of muscle and

3024.319 --> 3028.24
integrity

3025.44 --> 3029.839
of their bone structure you know because

3028.24 --> 3033.359
you can be kind of fat that doesn't mean

3029.839 --> 3033.359
you have to be unhealthy fat

3035.68 --> 3039.7599999999998
it all depends on what you have in your

3037.599 --> 3040.4
body you can even build up a little fat

3039.76 --> 3043.28
and still

3040.4 --> 3044.7200000000003
just have no problem whatsoever it might

3043.28 --> 3047.2000000000003
even help you a little against the cold

3044.72 --> 3048.9599999999996
but if you have too much then eventually

3047.2 --> 3051.359
just the percentage of fat in your

3048.96 --> 3053.92
system will cause

3051.359 --> 3055.04
like yeah stacking influence on your

3053.92 --> 3057.52
hormonal system

3055.04 --> 3058.88
so that will eventually if you get too

3057.52 --> 3063.28
fat it will distort

3058.88 --> 3063.28
everything it will break up the balance

3066.839 --> 3069.839
right

3072.559 --> 3077.119
relative density is an effect not an

3074.72 --> 3080.7999999999997
effect

3077.119 --> 3084.6400000000003
well relative density is a description

3080.8 --> 3088.2400000000002
for the process the effect

3084.64 --> 3090.7999999999997
is the

3088.24 --> 3092.0789999999997
vertical displacement upwards and

3090.8 --> 3095.44
downwards of

3092.079 --> 3097.2000000000003
material when there's no other

3095.44 --> 3100.88
influences

3097.2 --> 3104.0
versus the medium that's the effect

3100.88 --> 3106.079
the cause is the relative density

3104.0 --> 3109.119
disequilibrium it is

3106.079 --> 3110.2400000000002
the differential between the object and

3109.119 --> 3112.7200000000003
the medium

3110.24 --> 3114.0
being different and how they are

3112.72 --> 3117.7599999999998
different will also

3114.0 --> 3119.599
direct the direction of it

3117.76 --> 3121.92
of the object versus the medium because

3119.599 --> 3123.52
the medium is assumed to not be

3121.92 --> 3126.0
displacing

3123.52 --> 3128.0
because if it is it will yeah introduce

3126.0 --> 3130.0
other forces that will cause

3128.0 --> 3131.359
other influences and distort the process

3130.0 --> 3134.96
just like how a

3131.359 --> 3138.319
diving plane remember the vomit comet

3134.96 --> 3139.92
zero g right that effectively

3138.319 --> 3142.0
tends to cause that because there's

3139.92 --> 3144.8
another force

3142.0 --> 3145.52
being thrown on top of the relative

3144.8 --> 3148.1600000000003
density

3145.52 --> 3149.68
displacement tendency canceling it out

3148.16 --> 3152.5589999999997
also the the air

3149.68 --> 3154.64
in such a plane is moving with the whole

3152.559 --> 3156.559
medium with the object and everything so

3154.64 --> 3159.7599999999998
there's no

3156.559 --> 3161.2000000000003
effective displacement but that's

3159.76 --> 3162.96
because there's another force being

3161.2 --> 3164.5589999999997
introduced and that's not natural that

3162.96 --> 3165.04
doesn't happen here on earth the earth

3164.559 --> 3168.1600000000003
isn't

3165.04 --> 3168.16
displacing like that

3170.8 --> 3174.1600000000003
so i hope that explains it

3179.44 --> 3181.839
effect

3182.559 --> 3189.119
is the vertical

3185.839 --> 3193.2799999999997
pressure and displacement and the cause

3189.119 --> 3196.1600000000003
is the disequilibrium

3193.28 --> 3209.8390000000004
of the differential between the object

3196.16 --> 3209.839
and the medium

3211.92 --> 3215.76
thoughts and exploration yeah that

3213.76 --> 3218.559
sounds really interesting but it

3215.76 --> 3218.559
takes money

3221.599 --> 3225.3590000000004
you know maybe eventually

3225.839 --> 3233.839
right now it's not for me although i

3229.28 --> 3236.88
i absolutely have my thoughts about it

3233.839 --> 3238.72
you know what would we encounter how

3236.88 --> 3241.119
how would you approach this but yeah

3238.72 --> 3243.68
that's poof that's

3241.119 --> 3244.48
that's a giant subject on its own i'm

3243.68 --> 3246.0
not really

3244.48 --> 3248.319
in the mood to think about that right

3246.0 --> 3250.24
now because it's not beforehand

3248.319 --> 3253.599
and i don't know anyone out there that

3250.24 --> 3253.5989999999997
is planning this

3254.0 --> 3257.359
among flat earthers at least

3260.96 --> 3267.839
affect this cause or effect

3264.559 --> 3271.8390000000004
the cause of the effect the effect

3267.839 --> 3276.24
is the is the vertical displacement

3271.839 --> 3280.319
and pressure caused by the object

3276.24 --> 3284.16
whatever it is right

3280.319 --> 3284.48
the cause is the disequilibrium between

3284.16 --> 3287.1189999999997
the

3284.48 --> 3288.64
object and the medium this equilibrium

3287.119 --> 3290.2400000000002
of the density

3288.64 --> 3293.2799999999997
which you can translate into a

3290.24 --> 3297.1189999999997
differential number

3293.28 --> 3301.119
the number is anything other than

3297.119 --> 3307.839
one there will be displacement or

3301.119 --> 3307.839
pressure by the object

3318.839 --> 3321.839
hmm

3324.24 --> 3328.799
maybe i can translate it in rough math

3326.72 --> 3330.0789999999997
in chat i never do this but i don't know

3328.799 --> 3334.21
it just came to me

3330.079 --> 3340.75
it's not that hard even right so

3334.21 --> 3340.75
[Music]

3342.82 --> 3348.52
[Music]

3349.28 --> 3363.8390000000004
all right

3371.68 --> 3377.839
see is that mathematical enough for you

3385.04 --> 3391.839
yeah and you can turn the division the

3387.2 --> 3391.839
other way around just as well

3417.68 --> 3419.839
hmm

3435.28 --> 3438.3190000000004
right anything else

3440.319 --> 3443.52
oh yeah one thing i could say by the way

3443.119 --> 3447.04
about

3443.52 --> 3450.64
exploration i'm thinking zeppelins

3447.04 --> 3453.44
i think zeppelins will do great

3450.64 --> 3453.44
do excellent

3458.96 --> 3465.76
a zeppelin's maybe like a

3462.0 --> 3467.68
a a cruise like a cruiser

3465.76 --> 3470.079
where it could potentially land or

3467.68 --> 3470.0789999999997
something

3470.24 --> 3475.4399999999996
now maybe a refueling cruiser

3473.359 --> 3478.0
just take a zeppelin have a refueling

3475.44 --> 3478.0
cruiser

3479.599 --> 3483.2000000000003
and yeah that would do great

3485.599 --> 3489.2000000000003
maybe you could even combine it get get

3487.68 --> 3491.2
really crazy

3489.2 --> 3492.8799999999997
maybe you could literally take a boat

3491.2 --> 3496.319
and then

3492.88 --> 3497.92
have a zeppelin mechanism that basically

3496.319 --> 3501.839
could be

3497.92 --> 3506.2400000000002
blown up like it just has this zeppelin

3501.839 --> 3508.16
thing in it that could unfold and then

3506.24 --> 3510.3999999999996
a lot of gas tanks to fill it up so it

3508.16 --> 3512.96
could literally utilize like a big

3510.4 --> 3514.48
boat and then at some point it could

3512.96 --> 3517.839
lift off

3514.48 --> 3517.839
but yeah that's

3518.88 --> 3522.6400000000003
that will take quite a feat of

3520.64 --> 3525.839
engineering i bet

3522.64 --> 3528.4
it's not going to be cheap but hey

3525.839 --> 3531.839
you want exploration why not do it the

3528.4 --> 3531.839
right way you know

3544.96 --> 3549.2
a zeppelin for exploration emblem

3552.96 --> 3560.88
you can make your own hydrogen well

3556.88 --> 3563.839
let's not use hydrogen for zeppelins

3560.88 --> 3566.4
you know that doesn't seem like all that

3563.839 --> 3568.24
great an idea

3566.4 --> 3570.2400000000002
but you probably are gonna have to knock

3568.24 --> 3573.839
with nasa for that

3570.24 --> 3575.2
because they got all the helium

3573.839 --> 3578.24
well you're gonna probably need their

3575.2 --> 3578.24
permission anyway

3578.799 --> 3583.2
yeah sounds kind of a bummer right if

3581.92 --> 3585.2000000000003
it's ever gonna happen

3583.2 --> 3586.799
whatever they do they're gonna have to

3585.2 --> 3589.9199999999996
have from give permission

3586.799 --> 3591.35
or yeah be made

3589.92 --> 3593.76
to get permission i don't know

3591.35 --> 3595.92
[Music]

3593.76 --> 3597.92
hydrogen has more lift yeah it also has

3595.92 --> 3600.839
a lot more explosive power

3597.92 --> 3602.0
huh huh you know including with

3600.839 --> 3605.2799999999997
electrostatics

3602.0 --> 3608.799
and all that oh look

3605.28 --> 3612.559
we're encountering an un familiar

3608.799 --> 3615.7599999999998
magnetic phenomena oops

3612.559 --> 3619.52
it's not sensitive to like

3615.76 --> 3622.1600000000003
yeah radiation yeah projection weapons

3619.52 --> 3622.96
like military seems to be having right

3622.16 --> 3626.5589999999997
now

3622.96 --> 3629.37
you know at all now let's just use a

3626.559 --> 3633.1000000000004
non-flame non-flammable gas right

3629.37 --> 3633.1
[Laughter]

3637.59 --> 3642.319
[Music]

3639.2 --> 3646.24
yeah getting high is yeah look

3642.319 --> 3647.7599999999998
you're not gonna explore up there

3646.24 --> 3649.9199999999996
you know that would be another project i

3647.76 --> 3652.1600000000003
thought you were talking exploration of

3649.92 --> 3655.44
like the antarctica

3652.16 --> 3657.839
north wherever maybe that i would go for

3655.44 --> 3657.839
a zeppelin

3660.0 --> 3674.96
yeah hydrogen go boom boom indeed

3671.119 --> 3674.96
yeah you remember the hidden berg

3684.319 --> 3689.2
right anyway i'm rounding out the show

3687.44 --> 3691.2000000000003
thanks everyone for coming i thought it

3689.2 --> 3693.04
was a great show today

3691.2 --> 3694.8799999999997
