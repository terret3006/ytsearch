81.75 --> 89.22
barely see it there see this is looking

85.86 --> 89.79
through a window huh because there's an

89.22 --> 93.26
edge

89.79 --> 97.19000000000001
it's that clean yeah but it's yeah it's

93.26 --> 100.79
quite nice but three hours ago

97.19 --> 106.08
there was a huge cloud coming by and

100.79 --> 107.4
with quite a few buckets of rain but

106.08 --> 111.25999999999999
then flew over again

125.55 --> 133.84
usually a GM gets in first or very

129.01 --> 135.57
quickly stone monkey 3d lumberjack good

133.84 --> 143.59
to see you Obama cool

135.57 --> 154.89999999999998
Jason McCormick yeah so today I got with

143.59 --> 158.38
me just Tamera coffee and tea I am a

154.9 --> 165.04000000000002
kind of a bit tired maybe because I was

158.38 --> 169.03
up pretty late kept up just keep

165.04 --> 171.73
watching things and trying to make some

169.03 --> 177.51
sense of what Alex Jones was trying to

171.73 --> 181.08999999999997
put down with his World War 4 claim and

177.51 --> 187.81
it was kind of interesting but it seemed

181.09 --> 190.3
a little over exaggerated but yeah there

187.81 --> 197.76
are things moving there's like switches

190.3 --> 200.56
going around in the political world and

197.76 --> 203.10999999999999
well yeah if you just follow the regular

200.56 --> 205.42000000000002
media you'd be up for a total clown show

203.11 --> 212.08
because it's become so insane and

205.42 --> 213.42999999999998
surreal the mainstream it's hard to keep

212.08 --> 216.43
your mind together

213.43 --> 218.89000000000001
I can barely imagine what it would be

216.43 --> 220.9
like if you really didn't know it was

218.89 --> 224.67
just all nonsense

220.9 --> 224.67000000000002
or the most of it what they do

229.94 --> 236.01
yeah also been looking in some more

232.74 --> 243.81
Feynman lectures although pretty shortly

236.01 --> 246.35999999999999
before the show mostly been taking it

243.81 --> 249.18
easy today it's one of the first days

246.36 --> 251.01000000000002
since a long time that I'm not feeling

249.18 --> 255.51000000000002
that sick I didn't even need any clay

251.01 --> 259.43
today might have helped that I had it

255.51 --> 262.71
just a freshly prepared dinner for

259.43 --> 265.62
myself which took a lot a lot of work to

262.71 --> 268.89
do but that first meal is always the

265.62 --> 271.73
most nutritious for me when I make a

268.89 --> 275.25
batch like that I made chili for myself

271.73 --> 277.70000000000005
so lots lots of vegetables in there lots

275.25 --> 277.7
of herbs

289.7 --> 293.9
what ya doing okay

300.15 --> 311.19
yesterday got a little weird in the

305.82 --> 315.5
premier rant he was all it was like

311.19 --> 315.5
stalking me almost it was just freaky

325.81 --> 334.45
I'm not even gonna spend another second

328.39 --> 334.69
on that I'm just I'm just creeped out by

334.45 --> 344.65
it

334.69 --> 348.99
oh right yeah loan IE now you got some

344.65 --> 348.98999999999995
explaining to do after yesterday

356.34 --> 366.17999999999995
I got a a message a comment from a spoke

362.07 --> 369.21
loud that he's yeah looking into his

366.18 --> 372.389
lawyer is on to it up to this weird

369.21 --> 374.7
slandering attempt that started out

372.389 --> 376.919
yesterday for some reason especially in

374.7 --> 379.58
my chat and you were part of that in

376.919 --> 379.58
lone hyena

395.51 --> 398.08
yeah

412.65 --> 415.89
[Music]

421.76 --> 429.05
or really John Watson I didn't know that

424.72 --> 434.51000000000005
no idea what Randy has been doing before

429.05 --> 437.26
Flat Earth he shared a little about it

434.51 --> 437.26
but not too much

463.43 --> 467.69
yeah it feels kind of weird you know the

466.49 --> 471.41
whole situation

467.69 --> 474.5
let's just talk about yeah where I'm at

471.41 --> 477.16900000000004
in the scene with the debates and

474.5 --> 480.56
everything that's going on because I'm

477.169 --> 483.94899999999996
in a really weird position here and at

480.56 --> 488.09
this point I think that Anthony Reilly

483.949 --> 490.639
is probably like the only guy that I'm

488.09 --> 495.53
now desperately holding on to as being

490.639 --> 499.87
an actual reliable person that is

495.53 --> 502.46
persistently like himself because

499.87 --> 507.5
everybody's just switching around on me

502.46 --> 514.01
and while Nathan kind of did that before

507.5 --> 516.65
also apologized and he's just he's

514.01 --> 520.729
treating me fair enough

516.65 --> 525.709
could be better but I'm fine with that

520.729 --> 528.0500000000001
and well John I just don't like John

525.709 --> 532.55
let's just say it like that I think he's

528.05 --> 535.43
kind of a dick I personally dislike the

532.55 --> 538.91
way he handles himself in the face of

535.43 --> 542.15
other people and I really am NOT that

538.91 --> 546.05
overly interested in his hate opinions

542.15 --> 552.74
which he does seem to be but other than

546.05 --> 555.4399999999999
that he's kind of treating me fair and

552.74 --> 558.02
allowing me to have my criticism about

555.44 --> 562.85
him without being a total sivan yay

558.02 --> 563.5699999999999
towards me about it so yeah I thought oh

562.85 --> 566.72
my god

563.57 --> 570.08
you know John is gonna be it's gonna go

566.72 --> 574.07
out of control and I'm gonna be facing

570.08 --> 576.11
him and now with all this craziness and

574.07 --> 579.95
people getting going their own ways all

576.11 --> 586.9300000000001
of a sudden I find myself now at John's

579.95 --> 586.9300000000001
side while I kind of yeah

587.489 --> 595.9590000000001
once I had despised him but it's not

591.159 --> 600.849
like my favorite guy is weird because he

595.959 --> 607.079
still at least has integrity even though

600.849 --> 607.0790000000001
there are issues because in his own way

607.439 --> 612.879
he isn't not perfect in his oversight in

610.479 --> 615.6990000000001
things and sometimes I managed to sneak

612.879 --> 620.289
in some questions and there echoed and

615.699 --> 624.579
then he teeters with how you'll respond

620.289 --> 627.22
to it because much of what he worked on

624.579 --> 630.0989999999999
to solidifying it did the absolute

627.22 --> 633.009
knowing of all things is probably been

630.099 --> 634.869
outdated in certain regions so he seems

633.009 --> 637.359
to be faltering and how to approach it

634.869 --> 639.399
he doesn't really know so then he kind

637.359 --> 642.909
of red herrings it sometimes a bit and

639.399 --> 645.549
that is suspicious but I'm pretty sure

642.909 --> 649.239
that is probably the reason why because

645.549 --> 650.799
he's he's a guy he learned a lot but

649.239 --> 653.159
that doesn't mean he knows everything

650.799 --> 658.559
even though that is part of his image

653.159 --> 667.079
supposedly social why's that he upholds

658.559 --> 671.139
so but still among many he is still a

667.079 --> 677.5889999999999
more reliable guy than most others I

671.139 --> 684.189
don't think John's gonna flip-flop in

677.589 --> 686.729
his social attitude anytime soon like

684.189 --> 686.7289999999999
some others

687.12 --> 699.19
no I've never seen his face and I've

689.83 --> 702.46
also complained about that but in this

699.19 --> 706.6
case I'm simply going by what he brings

702.46 --> 712.75
to the table the the lessons that he

706.6 --> 715.48
gave us had the flaws that he has within

712.75 --> 718.23
them within his teachings because it's

715.48 --> 718.23
not perfect

723.13 --> 732.43
right but yeah at this point I'm not

728.49 --> 734.2
gonna risk things to keep in my friend

732.43 --> 736.93
or anything because I don't really know

734.2 --> 739.9000000000001
who he is other than his voice that's

736.93 --> 743.1099999999999
true and I have some doubts about things

739.9 --> 743.6999999999999
that he tells about himself but it's no

743.11 --> 748.0600000000001
use

743.7 --> 749.96
getting into that without going to a

748.06 --> 753.0189999999999
little hostile you know

749.96 --> 753.019
[Music]

762.13 --> 764.699
huh

767.28 --> 776.04
okay PJ fine well obviously the guy

771.75 --> 780.09
wants his anonymity and that could be

776.04 --> 782.4
because he's very afraid to be a target

780.09 --> 785.1
because he was warned that that would

782.4 --> 786.66
happen from his position if he do some

785.1 --> 792.95
if he did engaged with something like

786.66 --> 795.93
this if he really is who he says he is

792.95 --> 798.11
and those new people that he says he

795.93 --> 798.1099999999999
knows

804.72 --> 811.49
yes exactly thank you for backing me in

807.84 --> 811.49
that ego plane and Anchor

818.46 --> 824.64
but yeah as it goes as the rules are as

823.2 --> 828.9300000000001
long as you've really can't see

824.64 --> 831.6
somebody's face you can only go by what

828.93 --> 836.9699999999999
you can go by and you shouldn't put your

831.6 --> 841.08
full trust in in somebody that that's

836.97 --> 845.4590000000001
not completely open and traceable as it

841.08 --> 847.4100000000001
were but yeah to then automatically

845.459 --> 851.899
scoff them away like they are completely

847.41 --> 854.9399999999999
worthless that is just dumb as well

851.899 --> 860.55
again over generalization making it easy

854.94 --> 863.2790000000001
on yourself like it's like trimming your

860.55 --> 867.51
sources that's kind of dumb

863.279 --> 871.98
I never trim my sources I simply size up

867.51 --> 874.38
the energy value and the pollution value

871.98 --> 876.8100000000001
of them of entangling myself with them

874.38 --> 882.81
putting my attention on them that's how

876.81 --> 885.66
I size up sources how much poison are

882.81 --> 888.779
you receiving out of it do you know the

885.66 --> 891.75
poison can you defend against it and how

888.779 --> 894.57
much energy how much new information or

891.75 --> 898.23
a good inspiration that could be

894.57 --> 901.5
recycled for creative purposes or we

898.23 --> 904.86
have whatever I'm doing and that's the

901.5 --> 907.529
energy value j-john don't just say oh my

904.86 --> 909.63
god this person may have a certain issue

907.529 --> 912.39
with something he might not have been

909.63 --> 914.79
honest about and then you say oh my god

912.39 --> 916.3199999999999
he lied that means that I just gotta

914.79 --> 918.5699999999999
throw it all away

916.32 --> 925.0790000000001
can never think about it again because

918.57 --> 926.2090000000001
he lied only mentally deranged people do

925.079 --> 929.4799999999999
that

926.209 --> 929.4799999999999
just saying

931.28 --> 936.53
but you gotta keep it in mind though

933.63 --> 940.92
it's just yeah I gotta keep record and

936.53 --> 943.64
you got to bite the poison if you want

940.92 --> 943.64
to sit through it

954.52 --> 961.3299999999999
yeah Oh John Watson that is also true

958.17 --> 966.93
that's even admittedly true and who

961.33 --> 970.9200000000001
knows maybe John does have like a tasked

966.93 --> 973.8389999999999
but that's the funny thing about it look

970.92 --> 977.11
even in operators if we're talking about

973.839 --> 980.08
for example military or CIA influence on

977.11 --> 984.07
media and they have vast influences they

980.08 --> 984.5200000000001
do a lot of source for wedding as it

984.07 --> 990.69
were

984.52 --> 994.959
so if John was some kind of agent or a a

990.69 --> 997.33
control factor for flatter debates for

994.959 --> 999.76
this scene for the science he here well

997.33 --> 1002.7900000000001
what is he effectively doing you could

999.76 --> 1008.459
say well he's keeping her holding

1002.79 --> 1011.01
secrets well not really because he does

1008.459 --> 1013.2299999999999
encourage people to educate to really

1011.01 --> 1017.3389999999999
learn the tough stuff and to figure it

1013.23 --> 1020.839
out and I'm being very criticizing and

1017.339 --> 1026.429
he still takes me seriously yeah he is

1020.839 --> 1030.329
having a bit of an attitude sometimes so

1026.429 --> 1034.2900000000002
I think that if anything he was placed

1030.329 --> 1038.339
among us to kind of keep us on the track

1034.29 --> 1043.23
and not going the way of dispersed chemo

1038.339 --> 1047.1
as it were into complete crazy sensory

1043.23 --> 1051.3
denialism and solipsism because John

1047.1 --> 1054.7199999999998
definitely does oppose all that and for

1051.3 --> 1059.6699999999998
whatever flaws within the details of his

1054.72 --> 1064.53
reasoning or personal life philosophy he

1059.67 --> 1068.13
does uphold pretty logos based things

1064.53 --> 1072.1499999999999
he's not he's not like a weirdo that has

1068.13 --> 1075.66
very strange ideas well it's unless you

1072.15 --> 1078.7800000000002
consider Flat Earth or creation or the

1075.66 --> 1081.059
Creator a weird thing but yeah that

1078.78 --> 1083.19
that's a side issue in this case he

1081.059 --> 1088.82
doesn't have any lives let's just say

1083.19 --> 1088.8200000000002
issues like for example PJ just clear

1089.809 --> 1096.99
obsessions towards strange things that

1093.57 --> 1101.279
just become typically of him because of

1096.99 --> 1103.59
the obsession you know what I mean John

1101.279 --> 1105.539
doesn't do that except for the the clown

1103.59 --> 1114.6
and the crayon munching you know that

1105.539 --> 1117.539
his the memes so yeah I thought if John

1114.6 --> 1119.76
was some kind of agent then I think he's

1117.539 --> 1123.179
an agent of stabilization then he's an

1119.76 --> 1126.27
agent of maybe a bit of a stick behind

1123.179 --> 1129.1490000000001
the door like hey guys stop [ __ ]

1126.27 --> 1135.87
around and actually developed something

1129.149 --> 1139.77
real because it needs to be it needs to

1135.87 --> 1144.059
hit the rest of the world cuz there's

1139.77 --> 1146.37
plans for beyond flatter the

1144.059 --> 1150.48
classifications maybe or maybe some

1146.37 --> 1158.4289999999999
people have plans maybe the the room is

1150.48 --> 1160.76
divided or yeah the room the military I

1158.429 --> 1160.76
don't know

1162.909 --> 1172.5390000000002
oh come on you don't have to do that

1170.129 --> 1174.4889999999998
please if you're going to type something

1172.539 --> 1177.7
just leave it out there don't delete

1174.489 --> 1184.8690000000001
that please unless you were going to

1177.7 --> 1187.3790000000001
corrected I appreciates everyone's input

1184.869 --> 1187.379
about this

1203.52 --> 1211.48
right yeah ego playing an anchor you are

1207.309 --> 1213.61
correct you are correct technically but

1211.48 --> 1216.58
there are some issues with it there's a

1213.61 --> 1221.9399999999998
downside namely if he doesn't put his

1216.58 --> 1227.35
face there and is just the open

1221.94 --> 1230.65
character then we can't really use him

1227.35 --> 1233.6789999999999
so much to lean on like look this guy

1230.65 --> 1236.679
with this we everybody knows he has all

1233.679 --> 1238.75
these official you don't get that with

1236.679 --> 1243.25
the that's the problem of the anonymity

1238.75 --> 1245.049
so if he were completely open I don't

1243.25 --> 1247.48
know what risks he would be taking if he

1245.049 --> 1252.61
even has the option to do that but I

1247.48 --> 1257.34
think that would help his colleagues

1252.61 --> 1259.9289999999999
more he would be better to lean upon but

1257.34 --> 1265.27
easier to point out for certain

1259.929 --> 1268.6000000000001
arguments references I don't know we'll

1265.27 --> 1276.8799999999999
just see what happens it's not really

1268.6 --> 1279.299
all that relevant yeah hello Adam Egan

1276.88 --> 1279.2990000000002
by the way

1291.11 --> 1304.4599999999998
yep bill G totally agree but alright but

1302.04 --> 1309.0
I don't think that being a foul-mouthed

1304.46 --> 1311.76
person doesn't really make you a not

1309.0 --> 1315.11
Christian necessarily it's just a show

1311.76 --> 1317.61
of weakness of character that's all

1315.11 --> 1322.1399999999999
because he's not literally gonna do it

1317.61 --> 1326.6699999999998
it's just a petty threat if you know

1322.14 --> 1328.7700000000002
what I mean if somebody says that you're

1326.67 --> 1333.69
not literally gonna believe he's gonna

1328.77 --> 1336.3899999999999
be doing that right maybe if they'd say

1333.69 --> 1338.94
it face to face I I'd feel a little bit

1336.39 --> 1343.5500000000002
more threatened but who's gonna take

1338.94 --> 1346.64
that serious a remark like that you know

1343.55 --> 1349.6399999999999
it's clearly just an expression of

1346.64 --> 1349.64
frustration

1356.03 --> 1363.94
and a yeah attempt at into social

1359.9 --> 1363.94
intimidation that that's also obvious

1374.9 --> 1382.66
why are you talking about you know and a

1379.82 --> 1386.32
bear not all priests or Pio's come on

1382.66 --> 1386.3200000000002
don't do that

1418.08 --> 1421.259
all right

1430.97 --> 1433.97
just

1437.659 --> 1443.13
Irie I'm really displeased with this

1440.37 --> 1445.9189999999999
meme persisting err okay really

1443.13 --> 1450.8990000000001
displeased and now there's a lot of

1445.919 --> 1454.46
issues certain groups of organized

1450.899 --> 1459.6899999999998
religion being pedo protectors yes

1454.46 --> 1461.929
absolutely but to say all priests okay

1459.69 --> 1468.1390000000001
that's just an insult I consider myself

1461.929 --> 1477.5700000000002
basically a priest in in my own religion

1468.139 --> 1480.09
and the priest is just a function and if

1477.57 --> 1485.1
that's in a church it's a hierarchy as

1480.09 --> 1488.549
well that simply means that there is

1485.1 --> 1491.809
just a unbalance in the entire system

1488.549 --> 1494.46
there's no cohesion so the powers are

1491.809 --> 1497.34
gaining the ability and the momentum to

1494.46 --> 1500.269
abuse that power it really has nothing

1497.34 --> 1507.779
to do with the function it's just a

1500.269 --> 1511.049
clear sign of overall corruption and and

1507.779 --> 1514.95
nothing being done about it and that

1511.049 --> 1518.4189999999999
kind of [ __ ] can probably set in in a

1514.95 --> 1521.519
lot of places if it gets the opportunity

1518.419 --> 1522.99
that's what corruption is I don't think

1521.519 --> 1526.5
it really has anything to do with

1522.99 --> 1530.539
necessity necessarily necessarily with

1526.5 --> 1530.539
religion organized religion even

1568.79 --> 1575.59
huh well PJ quite far

1575.65 --> 1582.5
quite quite far two years with a

1578.87 --> 1584.78
staggering amount of information not

1582.5 --> 1586.04
only were a lot of vision memories

1584.78 --> 1588.8899999999999
revealed to me

1586.04 --> 1591.35
they were also cleared up I figured out

1588.89 --> 1593.5400000000002
sub structure of what of all the

1591.35 --> 1596.4499999999998
experience that I went through even

1593.54 --> 1599.78
managed to divide several different

1596.45 --> 1603.05
types of well vision experiences that I

1599.78 --> 1608.21
then in the aftermath experience right

1603.05 --> 1610.49
through one another and I learned a lot

1608.21 --> 1614.6000000000001
about that about how to interpret what's

1610.49 --> 1619.04
coming what's happening about my

1614.6 --> 1620.9199999999998
personal inner doubts and conflict

1619.04 --> 1623.75
shion's

1620.92 --> 1626.45
know a lot about it I learned a lot also

1623.75 --> 1629.33
technically I learned so much I've depth

1626.45 --> 1639.68
in the last two years my god I've

1629.33 --> 1643.73
managed to get my my technical language

1639.68 --> 1645.74
is greatly improved and refined I was

1643.73 --> 1647.81
very colloquial in my approach

1645.74 --> 1650.02
originally when I approached all this

1647.81 --> 1654.59
higher I have always been I always

1650.02 --> 1658.55
wanted to do it my own way even though

1654.59 --> 1660.7099999999998
it's kind of clumsy in retrospect and I

1658.55 --> 1664.52
just learned to abandon that approach

1660.71 --> 1667.97
and really get the details get a new

1664.52 --> 1670.66
depth of approach and it worked out

1667.97 --> 1674.69
great and now as a result I'm actually

1670.66 --> 1677.3000000000002
learning quantum mechanics as in really

1674.69 --> 1680.75
figuring it out what it is in a way that

1677.3 --> 1683.54
I can relay it and not just say I think

1680.75 --> 1689.36
it's [ __ ] or there's something wrong

1683.54 --> 1692.74
but point at what so yeah lots of

1689.36 --> 1692.74
progress in the last two years

1693.96 --> 1699.46
and even character development as well

1697.359 --> 1702.33
my whole energy management has greatly

1699.46 --> 1708.3400000000001
improved my whole self confidence is

1702.33 --> 1714.1589999999999
skyrocketed and that's the funny thing

1708.34 --> 1716.139
it's I always talked about the swing of

1714.159 --> 1718.8400000000001
the pendulum right I was like goes up

1716.139 --> 1722.019
and goes down goes up well it has been

1718.84 --> 1726.279
going up and down but then the downturns

1722.019 --> 1729.729
have become less but the up turns don't

1726.279 --> 1733.029
seem to be taking a break in a similar

1729.729 --> 1735.159
fashion so the whole thing seems to be

1733.029 --> 1739.72
gradually moving up I wonder how long

1735.159 --> 1747.3400000000001
that'll keep up before my body breaks

1739.72 --> 1751.169
under all the energy but I seem to be

1747.34 --> 1751.1689999999999
doing fine so far

1762.68 --> 1774.47
no no John Watson that is no you you

1771.2 --> 1777.68
know what that was right the whole

1774.47 --> 1780.83
burning of the steak it was a it was a

1777.68 --> 1784.55
typical move to erase knowledge it was a

1780.83 --> 1789.35
power grab move from the theocracy very

1784.55 --> 1793.1499999999999
obviously so a power grab to consolidate

1789.35 --> 1796.04
on all the medical knowledge in order to

1793.15 --> 1799.16
erase it and then scratch it all from

1796.04 --> 1802.28
new with new medical discoveries oh look

1799.16 --> 1805.3400000000001
it's all new that is what which

1802.28 --> 1809.98
persecutions really are about erasing

1805.34 --> 1813.05
knowledge and it has nothing to do

1809.98 --> 1818.09
perdy fault with organized religion it

1813.05 --> 1820.85
has to do with with conquest within

1818.09 --> 1822.58
religion when religion has a conquest

1820.85 --> 1826.34
attitude or where there is a cake

1822.58 --> 1833.24
theocracy power base that is ambitious

1826.34 --> 1840.59
and wants to grab more but that's not

1833.24 --> 1843.08
and the problem was is that people take

1840.59 --> 1846.26
over the habits of their controllers if

1843.08 --> 1848.75
they see wow they are burning these

1846.26 --> 1850.8799999999999
women that we kind of respect it because

1848.75 --> 1852.83
they were very good with words they were

1850.88 --> 1855.2900000000002
very seductive and then they see and

1852.83 --> 1857.24
burning and they think yeah they had

1855.29 --> 1860.36
power over me so we're gonna burn them

1857.24 --> 1865.84
now and then that becomes like a giant

1860.36 --> 1869.84
stupid reflex echo and every time then

1865.84 --> 1872.06
when men would get really intimidated by

1869.84 --> 1875.0
the charms or the intelligence of a

1872.06 --> 1877.34
woman then they could throw back on that

1875.0 --> 1880.57
primitive behavior because the elites

1877.34 --> 1880.57
normalized it

1884.28 --> 1890.62
but it's really the cultural

1886.45 --> 1893.47
normalization the act and repeat echo

1890.62 --> 1897.3899999999999
that is it that is what that is it's not

1893.47 --> 1897.39
the standard default okay

1905.049 --> 1907.679
Hey

1918.11 --> 1926.059
it's Sheriff I don't know how you do it

1921.289 --> 1928.7
BJ it's just that the timing and the way

1926.059 --> 1931.82
you will ramble on and just drag other

1928.7 --> 1936.44
stuff into it every time in the same way

1931.82 --> 1940.22
it really nauseates me man just can't

1936.44 --> 1945.1100000000001
you just stay on a singular subject and

1940.22 --> 1947.99
not try to force everything to become

1945.11 --> 1951.01
about what you're dealing with at the

1947.99 --> 1951.01
time can you do that

1969.659 --> 1973.6490000000001
and yeah getting rid of that

1976.68 --> 1984.71
whoo yeah man time is not hurrying up

1990.82 --> 1999.76
right exactly I know I'm corrected it

1994.42 --> 2002.94
and we can see it even now and you could

1999.76 --> 2005.1
say it's religious behavior if you think

2002.94 --> 2007.65
of religion as like an indoctrination

2005.1 --> 2010.6399999999999
mindset like a spell to delude people

2007.65 --> 2017.22
and then drive them set them on a path

2010.64 --> 2020.7900000000002
because this nutty behavior is now not

2017.22 --> 2026.1000000000001
directed by a religion but by a more

2020.79 --> 2031.8899999999999
occult power a power cult and their

2026.1 --> 2034.6499999999999
media is now pushing people to to

2031.89 --> 2039.8700000000001
normalize into indecent behavior and

2034.65 --> 2045.8100000000002
even outright savage assaults

2039.87 --> 2047.9099999999999
for political reasons so at that it is

2045.81 --> 2052.7999999999997
really the same mechanism of the witch

2047.91 --> 2055.59
burning it's just purely politically

2052.8 --> 2058.8
driven shamelessly demonically

2055.59 --> 2062.48
politically driven instead of made

2058.8 --> 2065.13
excuses for for some religious doctrine

2062.48 --> 2067.919
that's the difference and it's being

2065.13 --> 2069.98
pushed by media same lessly demonic in

2067.919 --> 2072.39
your face to everyone and everybody

2069.98 --> 2075.36
unfortunately also is now getting used

2072.39 --> 2078.3599999999997
to demonic behavior where 20 years ago

2075.36 --> 2082.8900000000003
we would see demonic behavior in some

2078.36 --> 2086.7000000000003
dystopian sci-fi media whatever and we'd

2082.89 --> 2089.73
be like oh that makes me kind of

2086.7 --> 2093.06
uncomfortable now that's the freakin

2089.73 --> 2095.419
default and you know it you know that

2093.06 --> 2100.5
what you're looking at right now was

2095.419 --> 2105.12
creepy 20 30 40 years ago in sci-fi when

2100.5 --> 2107.28
we got the same the same intention being

2105.12 --> 2109.74
portrayed there as a dystopian

2107.28 --> 2113.46
mind-control future that's the attitude

2109.74 --> 2118.74
we got right now it's here right now

2113.46 --> 2123.41
staring you in the face and even people

2118.74 --> 2127.359
by their own voluntary nature

2123.41 --> 2130.67
for profit or fame or whatever

2127.359 --> 2136.91
ego-driven and therefore adopt these

2130.67 --> 2142.15
behaviors and these tricks because it's

2136.91 --> 2146.569
normalized it's out in the open so not

2142.15 --> 2150.559
religiously driven but culturally driven

2146.569 --> 2154.16
through normalization actively instead

2150.559 --> 2158.9300000000003
of an echo of a certain giant event made

2154.16 --> 2161.5389999999998
a huge impact it's gradually foretold

2158.93 --> 2164.95
from the soapboxes of modern day through

2161.539 --> 2171.98
the black screens instead of people on

2164.95 --> 2174.5789999999997
pedestals reading it out for you that's

2171.98 --> 2174.579
the difference

2179.32 --> 2182.51
[Music]

2188.83 --> 2195.65
[Music]

2192.36 --> 2195.65
hello for that side

2269.569 --> 2282.049
any good teams rule yes just looking at

2274.159 --> 2285.199
chat for a moment here ha yeah flat soit

2282.049 --> 2289.219
plenty thought of studying other

2285.199 --> 2293.239
languages but it's not my thing you know

2289.219 --> 2295.159
I think that continuing studying the

2293.239 --> 2297.889
English like English language and even

2295.159 --> 2300.049
the Dutch language is going to be a

2297.889 --> 2308.799
lifetime adventure and good enough for

2300.049 --> 2311.659
me but to be fair I do like for example

2308.799 --> 2315.499
sizing up like listening to a language

2311.659 --> 2319.539
or reading a piece in a language and

2315.499 --> 2319.5389999999998
then figuring out what language it is

2321.13 --> 2326.989
I've become kind of okay at that to

2324.529 --> 2328.88
recognize the language just by looking

2326.989 --> 2333.439
at it even though I can't technically

2328.88 --> 2336.38
read it or not good enough because for

2333.439 --> 2340.249
example I can read German pretty

2336.38 --> 2342.7290000000003
decently it's very close to Dutch in

2340.249 --> 2342.729
many ways

2354.77 --> 2358.96
but is the best sounding language

2364.09 --> 2372.9900000000002
that's really a matter of opinion a lot

2368.77 --> 2372.99
of languages can sound incredible

2384.829 --> 2394.469
it's really a matter of how well-spoken

2390.029 --> 2398.249
a person is because all the languages

2394.469 --> 2401.88
all have their original strengths roots

2398.249 --> 2403.769
their their spirit within them and if

2401.88 --> 2406.489
yeah if you're just gonna have a regular

2403.769 --> 2409.529
guy or girl from the street that's just

2406.489 --> 2412.039
whatever they're gonna be muffling and

2409.529 --> 2416.099
not really articulating and just

2412.039 --> 2421.369
whatever you know but if you have a very

2416.099 --> 2425.88
controlled well-spoken proper speaker

2421.369 --> 2432.059
then suddenly a lot about the language

2425.88 --> 2435.6600000000003
comes to life and that is for that

2432.059 --> 2438.9790000000003
counts for all the languages languages

2435.66 --> 2438.979
you wouldn't expect it from

2464.82 --> 2467.969
[Music]

2473.769 --> 2477.4889999999996
I'm almost out of tea

2481.24 --> 2485.72

2487.97 --> 2490.6299999999997

lots of rumors going around and issues

2671.43 --> 2694.3199999999997
with ranty and John and all over the

2677.49 --> 2699.47
place I've seen you in run me over here

2694.32 --> 2702.1200000000003
disagreements I wouldn't call it that I

2699.47 --> 2703.98
don't think we're really agreeing or

2702.12 --> 2708.71
disagreeing on anything he's just

2703.98 --> 2708.71
decided to start attacking my character

2715.7 --> 2726.48
I know he kind of wants me to go after

2724.38 --> 2728.4
him you know he's literally trying to

2726.48 --> 2735.78
poke me just like right to hand was

2728.4 --> 2739.44
doing in the same way but I'm just I'm

2735.78 --> 2745.88
still numb down from just that yeah the

2739.44 --> 2745.88
betrayal the character betrayal

2750.11 --> 2759.56
I think we can lose sight sometimes when

2757.22 --> 2762.14
we're trying to win an argument but he's

2759.56 --> 2765.29
getting really weird about it yesterday

2762.14 --> 2769.52
in chair god I'm gonna be such an rumor

2765.29 --> 2772.0099999999998
Nancy right now yesterday in chat yeah

2769.52 --> 2774.2
he went on and this is like after the

2772.01 --> 2778.4
show the premiere show and it went on in

2774.2 --> 2782.7799999999997
chat and he was trying to say things

2778.4 --> 2785.42
like yeah I contributed so much I'm even

2782.78 --> 2790.42
helping Nathan to uphold his website and

2785.42 --> 2793.94
it just felt like he was trying to like

2790.42 --> 2797.9300000000003
put his flag in everything like I own

2793.94 --> 2800.9900000000002
this this is because of me and it's just

2797.93 --> 2805.85
so awkward after everything we've been

2800.99 --> 2813.95
through to see him do this like why is

2805.85 --> 2820.61
that really necessary I try to stay

2813.95 --> 2822.46
clear of it may you know it sir granddad

2820.61 --> 2825.56
always say if you ain't got nice to say

2822.46 --> 2828.71
then why why not just get your naff shop

2825.56 --> 2833.69
sometimes discretion is the better part

2828.71 --> 2836.7200000000003
of valor my friend right yeah you're

2833.69 --> 2838.73
right it's just very hard for me to just

2836.72 --> 2840.77
completely ignore it like it was for

2838.73 --> 2842.75
example P Mars going nuts you know

2840.77 --> 2846.29
because that's like oh yeah he goes nuts

2842.75 --> 2849.41
whatever you just blow up blocks that's

2846.29 --> 2852.56
it but this is Randy you know I had so

2849.41 --> 2857.6
many conversations with him even offline

2852.56 --> 2862.34
and it just hurts so I'm almost just

2857.6 --> 2866.48
doing this going through it just to help

2862.34 --> 2868.8500000000004
myself get over it and oh as a practical

2866.48 --> 2872.17
honest defense against his personal

2868.85 --> 2879.86
attacks to show that I really do care I

2872.17 --> 2883.9300000000003
don't know it's justified anyone well I

2879.86 --> 2883.9300000000003
have to justify myself to me

2883.99 --> 2895.1
what's yourself that's always important

2886.76 --> 2895.82
right so that's what I'm doing oh here

2895.1 --> 2905.24
they go again

2895.82 --> 2906.44
oh please oh ankles girliest Tim Osmond

2905.24 --> 2913.31
it's all I wanna know

2906.44 --> 2915.89
yep what side of their line causes

2913.31 --> 2919.64
girliest in-laws moans I have an oxbow

2915.89 --> 2922.3399999999997
no I've never seen Tim Osmonds not girly

2919.64 --> 2924.77
feet checking checking in with Alex just

2922.34 --> 2931.67
just to get my shout all right I got

2924.77 --> 2934.67
pretty big feet not long but they're

2931.67 --> 2938.41
really wide my feet are way hmm you're

2934.67 --> 2938.41
gonna start calling them analogies out

2938.44 --> 2947.23
and this is good

2940.33 --> 2947.23
wider feet means better balance and

2947.59 --> 2956.15
longer feet could potentially mean

2952.12 --> 2958.6099999999997
longer jump or a schlong hopping

2956.15 --> 2961.55
distance now it's bring it means it

2958.61 --> 2963.92
effectively means bigger hopping

2961.55 --> 2973.7000000000003
distance when you walk or really try to

2963.92 --> 2975.32
sprint sports athletics anyway yeah glad

2973.7 --> 2977.66
to see yourself enjoying there I'm

2975.32 --> 2979.5800000000004
really jealous I feel like taking off my

2977.66 --> 2989.93
shoes and just walking into that water

2979.58 --> 2993.89
there lucky bastard yeah it's the last

2989.93 --> 2995.48
hour before a head backs over I'll

2993.89 --> 3001.35
probably sign off but I just want to say

2995.48 --> 3001.35
one thing that's good look to John yeah

3001.47 --> 3010.0899999999997
he gets a lot of [ __ ] but no nosy spot

3006.82 --> 3013.21
and I think it'd be as a lot of stuff

3010.09 --> 3015.6400000000003
that we can put personalities aside

3013.21 --> 3019.48
this is a common we're all a lot more

3015.64 --> 3023.92
powerful right well I wouldn't put it

3019.48 --> 3026.95
aside I just take it with it I see John

3023.92 --> 3030.61
as two points really good information

3026.95 --> 3031.8399999999997
and inside one point annoying character

3030.61 --> 3033.61
you're gonna have to deal with and

3031.84 --> 3037.7200000000003
that's just how I see it and that's

3033.61 --> 3040.0
still very much worth subscribing to in

3037.72 --> 3042.64
my opinion so I've subscribed to his

3040.0 --> 3046.33
channel and I hope that he does also at

3042.64 --> 3052.96
least pass the thousand mark so I could

3046.33 --> 3055.15
just provide for himself a little should

3052.96 --> 3057.25
be a focus channel and I just want to

3055.15 --> 3061.27
wish him all the best then I look

3057.25 --> 3065.8
forward to watching it's over yeah me

3061.27 --> 3074.83
too I'm sure could be a we might even

3065.8 --> 3077.11
get an invite always like guys always

3074.83 --> 3080.02
love you pal have a good'n I'll catch it

3077.11 --> 3081.34
we you and I on the mainland god bless

3080.02 --> 3083.83
everyone I'll see y'all soon yeah

3081.34 --> 3087.94
alright thanks for popping by and yeah

3083.83 --> 3093.41
enjoy your time there forget my awesome

3087.94 --> 3100.57
not safe alright hey thanks for coming

3093.41 --> 3100.5699999999997
[Music]

3106.55 --> 3116.96
what yeah yeah quantum eraser does have

3114.05 --> 3119.1200000000003
a new channel I guess so I do recommend

3116.96 --> 3123.98
you subscribe to him I subscribe to him

3119.12 --> 3127.31
because you know it's weird for him to

3123.98 --> 3130.28
be dependent on Nathan purely all the

3127.31 --> 3133.2799999999997
controversy so it's good if he just had

3130.28 --> 3141.0800000000004
his own base for his information at

3133.28 --> 3152.42
least so let me find that that channel

3141.08 --> 3156.7999999999997
is and yet if you can just subscribe to

3152.42 --> 3164.06
him and just yeah give him a chance

3156.8 --> 3170.96
Oh how's my volume what's wrong oh it's

3164.06 --> 3173.02
very low again oh there yeah it reset

3170.96 --> 3179.93
that's just great

3173.02 --> 3184.52
okay better yeah yeah the volume

3179.93 --> 3187.79
automatically reset because that's what

3184.52 --> 3189.53
I always wonder of course that's just I

3187.79 --> 3192.7599999999998
can't help it but I reset it back to

3189.53 --> 3192.76
what they already know

3203.04 --> 3205.73
god

3227.44 --> 3233.16
yeah yeah was nice to have had him over

3230.49 --> 3236.1699999999996
it was good to have a nice look

3233.16 --> 3238.48
especially in at the beach I'm so

3236.17 --> 3241.349
jealous jealous I haven't been to any

3238.48 --> 3245.89
kind of beach like that in ages

3241.349 --> 3252.509
and I really have always enjoyed the

3245.89 --> 3257.71
beach a lot be really good to get back

3252.509 --> 3259.41
to some kind of beach someday as long as

3257.71 --> 3263.619
I'm still alive

3259.41 --> 3267.299
yeah IV I'm doing fine but I speak all

3263.619 --> 3270.099
English here that's just how it goes

3267.299 --> 3272.529
hey if you after the show or anything

3270.099 --> 3276.0
want to have a conversation in Dutch on

3272.529 --> 3276.0
skype no problem

3281.77 --> 3285.28
lycée beach

3315.09 --> 3317.78
all right

3317.92 --> 3324.13
Oh magnets pull that that does kind of

3320.71 --> 3327.76
make sense because he did mention every

3324.13 --> 3330.82
time and made quite a lot of work of

3327.76 --> 3335.6800000000003
sharing it that every trip he took

3330.82 --> 3338.4700000000003
always cost him money so I guess that it

3335.68 --> 3340.81
just sees it more profitable to do what

3338.47 --> 3348.91
he's doing now instead of using all that

3340.81 --> 3351.72
stuff no but hey I'll gladly fill up the

3348.91 --> 3355.72
vacuum for you got for you guys

3351.72 --> 3358.1499999999996
metaphorically speaking of course but I

3355.72 --> 3360.31
still way I would need some camera for

3358.15 --> 3363.37
that at least

3360.31 --> 3366.7599999999998
for starters so if you want me to go get

3363.37 --> 3369.6099999999997
out there and get some nice footage that

3366.76 --> 3372.57
helped me with my GoFundMe it's in the

3369.61 --> 3372.57
description box below

3373.2 --> 3378.0
yeah ranty is still in there by the way

3395.03 --> 3403.51
well spare room music person why do you

3400.43 --> 3403.5099999999998
think I'm doing it

3416.66 --> 3424.16
because for example yesterday I

3420.52 --> 3429.65
explained it in like a five to ten

3424.16 --> 3433.19
minute talk exactly why I do this so

3429.65 --> 3439.04
it's just weird that you would pop up

3433.19 --> 3442.55
first time and say that yeah I already

3439.04 --> 3444.82
explained it so I wonder why do you

3442.55 --> 3444.82
think

3459.64 --> 3462.739
[Music]

3463.71 --> 3475.319
yeah conspiracy cats you know you could

3466.92 --> 3478.41
just take my offer of keeping you get it

3475.319 --> 3482.2799999999997
getting you unbanned every time and not

3478.41 --> 3484.109
just pop up just to get banned again in

3482.28 --> 3488.3
a way you know will happen why are you

3484.109 --> 3488.2999999999997
doing that such a waste of time for you

3490.16 --> 3499.02
you know it's kind of wouldn't you say

3494.609 --> 3500.8489999999997
that hey I got unbanned why I'm just as

3499.02 --> 3503.28
much as a dick as all the other trolls

3500.849 --> 3507.17

3551.799 --> 3555.93
completely useless tool

3576.38 --> 3579.01
yeah

3579.7 --> 3584.7999999999997
you know sometimes when you give

3581.95 --> 3589.1499999999996
somebody a finger they can actually work

3584.8 --> 3591.01
with it but others when you give them a

3589.15 --> 3594.1
finger they take your whole hand and

3591.01 --> 3598.59
then [ __ ] in it and it seems like

3594.1 --> 3598.5899999999997
conspiracy cats falls into that category

3615.789 --> 3622.179
