[Music]

35.86 --> 43.1
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

39.29 --> 44.75
early-bird number 265 I'm your host

43.1 --> 46.550000000000004
Arwen and before we start the show

44.75 --> 48.8
please don't forget to share it on any

46.55 --> 50.209999999999994
platform you deem fit and also if you

48.8 --> 51.949
haven't already subscribed to my channel

50.21 --> 53.269
and hit the bell notifications so you

51.949 --> 55.879
know when I'm going live which is

53.269 --> 56.12
normally 2:00 p.m. Amsterdam time every

55.879 --> 58.489
day

56.12 --> 61.28
also please support me through the Super

58.489 --> 62.05
chats PayPal especially while you still

61.28 --> 66.979
can

62.05 --> 71.72
patreon and my GoFundMe much obliged so

66.979 --> 74.15
yeah today it's pretty hot yeah it's not

71.72 --> 78.189
as hot as it was say a week ago but

74.15 --> 84.17
still it's warm enough and I thought

78.189 --> 87.08
yeah outside it's not super hot sitting

84.17 --> 89.06
in the shadow but the t-shirt on is very

87.08 --> 92.17999999999999
doable but the inside it's kind of warm

89.06 --> 96.92
so I just thought ok I'm just gonna do

92.18 --> 100.54
this without a shirt because it's warm

96.92 --> 103.54
still seeing some chemtrails up there

100.54 --> 103.54
unfortunately

105.84 --> 113.10000000000001
but at least it's not so so eerily still

110.659 --> 117.799
there at least there's a lot of wind now

113.1 --> 127.19999999999999
and it's nice so it's a nice summer day

117.799 --> 131.03900000000002
August is looking kind of good so let's

127.2 --> 136.89000000000001
see who is in chat

131.039 --> 140.48899999999998
I got Tamara coffee by the way and I got

136.89 --> 144.83999999999997
tea although I haven't poured any I got

140.489 --> 147.68
an apple we and still leftover sandwich

144.84 --> 151.64000000000001
don't know when I'm gonna eat that and

147.68 --> 153.59900000000002
again I had clay this time I had clay

151.64 --> 156.0
this stuff again

153.599 --> 163.10999999999999
pretty much right before and I'm gonna

156.0 --> 166.26
do it again because it's just weird you

163.11 --> 172.16000000000003
know I'm fine for a long long period of

166.26 --> 175.019
time and then suddenly I get nauseated

172.16 --> 178.079
like a morning sickness it doesn't go

175.019 --> 183.62
away then I remember oh wait clay let's

178.079 --> 183.62
try that and it just works really well

185.989 --> 192.31900000000002
it's kind of funny that I'm just eating

189.0 --> 192.319
dirt basically

195.57 --> 202.89
so yeah it looks like really murky water

202.92 --> 215.14
fortunately it doesn't have that typical

205.17 --> 217.32999999999998
disgusting taste of murky water yeah but

215.14 --> 220.92
it can get a little crackly between the

217.33 --> 220.92000000000002
teeth from this stuff

228.54 --> 239.349
yeah best to just flush it all down and

233.469 --> 245.319
not start chewing on that are you just

239.349 --> 248.85899999999998
you might damage your amalgam mmm so now

245.319 --> 251.33999999999997
let's see who is in chat so AGM was

248.859 --> 258.19
there earlier we had a long

251.34 --> 267.16
back-and-forth stone monkey 3d hey some

258.19 --> 272.71
cloud mind warped low Zep tepi

267.16 --> 278.139
and that one guy killed a hope oprah

272.71 --> 279.96999999999997
Mukul reckoner Stephon Alderson yeah

278.139 --> 287.139
stop with traffic in my rest I had of

279.97 --> 289.24
course good morning Amanda you know no I

287.139 --> 295.78000000000003
don't flush that down with whiskeys have

289.24 --> 298.0
to happy definitely not this is filtered

295.78 --> 302.67999999999995
water it's lovely

298.0 --> 306.729
filtered purified and energetically

302.68 --> 309.40000000000003
enhanced and no not gonna who drinks

306.729 --> 311.82
alcohol in the early morning anyway with

309.4 --> 311.82
this heat

321.029 --> 329.709
are already having doubts with about the

323.769 --> 333.209
coffee but I just wanted coffee mmm yeah

329.709 --> 336.999
I've been as I said I would

333.209 --> 340.92900000000003
restarting my studies in the Feynman

336.999 --> 343.959
lectures went through several pages I'm

340.929 --> 346.20899999999995
pretty astounded that I managed to look

343.959 --> 349.269
through two and a half chapters this

346.209 --> 351.729
morning alone but that is because well

349.269 --> 354.189
most of it was just so technical and

351.729 --> 357.429
mathematical that I could just skip most

354.189 --> 361.749
of it just try to get the gist of what

357.429 --> 363.75899999999996
he was trying to do eventually get lost

361.749 --> 366.879
because he gets into it way too much

363.759 --> 372.209
detail and like mathematical issues that

366.879 --> 372.209
I just don't really care about that much

372.419 --> 382.68899999999996
what it was interesting yeah there are

379.239 --> 388.82899999999995
relativistic effects of radiation that's

382.689 --> 388.829
where I'm reading right now for this

390.68 --> 399.22
oh yeah electromagnetic radiation read

396.949 --> 399.22
through that

405.46 --> 415.27
oh yeah geometric optics I thought that

409.12 --> 420.28000000000003
was very fascinating there was some just

415.27 --> 427.53999999999996
some very conceptual thing he it was so

420.28 --> 432.4
mathematical that the way he approaches

427.54 --> 435.49
it it just opens up a more real approach

432.4 --> 440.02
to the issues with optics in general and

435.49 --> 443.26
also with just how light is it is so

440.02 --> 444.84
incredibly complex to be fair even

443.26 --> 449.5
though I got a good feel for it I don't

444.84 --> 455.08
completely understand it but I can feel

449.5 --> 458.29
there's some important key keys here and

455.08 --> 461.22999999999996
that as I progress I will probably at

458.29 --> 464.07
some point loop back to this look at it

461.23 --> 469.38
again with new information and suddenly

464.07 --> 469.38
have things fall into place even better

469.53 --> 478.33
but it seems a very sensible tangible

474.07 --> 483.28
more tangible approach to optics with a

478.33 --> 485.68
lot of math though but it's fascinating

483.28 --> 488.26
and it also all the effects that

485.68 --> 491.17
fraction and what I get the feeling off

488.26 --> 494.56
in general and yeah I guess that is most

491.17 --> 500.5
of the first chapter is that it is just

494.56 --> 502.87
describing all the effects and well

500.5 --> 505.15
we've as flat-earthers we've come across

502.87 --> 510.19
all these effects like diffraction and

505.15 --> 512.01
interference and through light but they

510.19 --> 516.58
are also relevant in all the other

512.01 --> 522.36
things like radio and the rest of the

516.58 --> 522.36
spectrum apparently even radiation

525.43 --> 531.92
and I have the feeling and the idea the

529.82 --> 534.11
feedback from him that they really

531.92 --> 537.9699999999999
experimented with it and did figure it

534.11 --> 541.25
out although there is no direct example

537.97 --> 543.77
about that I just get the feeling that

541.25 --> 546.79
this guy has probably spent a huge

543.77 --> 549.23
amount of time just in a big laboratory

546.79 --> 550.9399999999999
experimenting with all kinds of setups

549.23 --> 555.11
and just keep on going and going and

550.94 --> 560.8100000000001
going and trying everything out because

555.11 --> 564.08
that is how he talks but it's really

560.81 --> 569.93
tough because he does overall keep it a

564.08 --> 574.13
lot in the explanation situation without

569.93 --> 576.2299999999999
really feeding back a lot to physical

574.13 --> 579.47
experiments although he does does it

576.23 --> 586.25
sometimes when explaining in the

579.47 --> 590.87
beginning huh it's just so wide it's so

586.25 --> 596.54
big I can't properly size it down to

590.87 --> 599.089
explain it I feel it's so big but I'm

596.54 --> 601.61
learning a lot and it does really feel

599.089 --> 604.4000000000001
like I'm going back to school it's

601.61 --> 609.19
interesting just like Oh a school book

604.4 --> 609.1899999999999
okay this is actually interesting and

609.67 --> 614.8299999999999
and the funny thing is I can take my

612.8 --> 614.8299999999999
time

617.59 --> 623.96
but I'm learning more and I do feel that

621.28 --> 626.0
this is gonna take quite a lot of time

623.96 --> 629.33
but at the end I'm pretty sure that I'll

626.0 --> 632.51
have an overall better grasp on the

629.33 --> 635.51
effects and what they really are things

632.51 --> 638.0
like that fraction and not just have

635.51 --> 640.97
reference points like oh yeah this is

638.0 --> 645.22
that effects describing it in a specific

640.97 --> 648.26
situation but truly physically optically

645.22 --> 652.64
understand better what that actually is

648.26 --> 655.9399999999999
and that would be good I need it because

652.64 --> 658.34
my overall optics knowledge has hasn't

655.94 --> 661.22
been super great and my intuition works

658.34 --> 662.6800000000001
fine I've good eyes and all that pay

661.22 --> 667.0400000000001
attention

662.68 --> 671.87
but the technicals behind it have eluded

667.04 --> 676.8499999999999
me so far at least but maybe this is a

671.87 --> 683.36
good chance to take stomp it all in here

676.85 --> 686.26
again now now that my brain has ripened

683.36 --> 686.26
a little more

687.75 --> 690.889
[Music]

693.02 --> 702.439
what the okay

696.92 --> 704.269
I'm talking about sausages right so

702.439 --> 706.389
let's see what you guys are talking

704.269 --> 706.389
about

710.78 --> 713.5899999999999
oh yeah

721.67 --> 727.0699999999999
I was by the way as a side thing for my

725.329 --> 735.56
family I was kind of shocked today to

727.07 --> 739.5400000000001
learn that apparently was it yeah two

735.56 --> 743.81
days ago one of my stepmothers dogs died

739.54 --> 746.269
and I really knew that creature so I was

743.81 --> 752.75
really shocked because I had a special

746.269 --> 762.7090000000001
bond with it but yeah that was

752.75 --> 768.56
unexpected for me like it got a very

762.709 --> 771.1099999999999
serious like a lung infection where it

768.56 --> 773.93
just filled up with fluid and yeah they

771.11 --> 775.79
had to put her down because would have

773.93 --> 778.6099999999999
been an agonizing death and couldn't be

775.79 --> 781.13
stopped and the creature was panicking

778.61 --> 783.94
over it eventually as well yeah that's

781.13 --> 783.9399999999999
really sad story

787.54 --> 793.9699999999999
it reminds me a bit of way back when my

791.87 --> 797.18
mother was still alive and I had kind of

793.97 --> 799.339
at that time it was my first attempt to

797.18 --> 801.68
basically really move out of home

799.339 --> 803.2090000000001
because I was just pissed off with my

801.68 --> 806.0889999999999
mother because she was treating me like

803.209 --> 810.9799999999999
my dad not leaving me alone and it moved

806.089 --> 814.7900000000001
out I did move out to my dad but didn't

810.98 --> 816.89
really know how to I just had to get

814.79 --> 819.05
away for a moment but then afterward I

816.89 --> 822.41
got back and then it turned out that one

819.05 --> 825.079
of my favorite cats from the family from

822.41 --> 828.05
those families of cat had died too had

825.079 --> 831.019
just gotten sick all of a sudden and

828.05 --> 833.66
it's yeah well I was a lot closer even

831.019 --> 836.44
with that creature really sad about that

833.66 --> 838.91
it's such a shock when you just find out

836.44 --> 842.3800000000001
you're not around for a moment and then

838.91 --> 842.38
suddenly the creatures are gone

845.779 --> 851.03
yeah

848.6 --> 852.71
I had some really interesting after work

851.03 --> 854.63
stories though like there's always

852.71 --> 859.6700000000001
things going on with spirits and

854.63 --> 863.9
everything and for some reason the way

859.67 --> 867.64
my stepmother has her dogs as kind of a

863.9 --> 871.61
bond with their dogs they even sort of

867.64 --> 874.46
well communicate with their or interact

871.61 --> 878.71
with their deceased spirits and guide

874.46 --> 881.6600000000001
them to the two beyond and they have

878.71 --> 890.12
well quite detailed accounts of this

881.66 --> 892.37
it's it's quite surreal wait but there's

890.12 --> 902.9
absolutely nothing nefarious about it I

892.37 --> 906.62
can assure you that anyway there's no

902.9 --> 909.26
restless spirit left she was with peace

906.62 --> 912.5
that had happened apparently was a bit

909.26 --> 917.02
Restless outside of her body you could

912.5 --> 920.0
say if you're gonna go with this I do

917.02 --> 928.87
it's weird to hear it some hear somebody

920.0 --> 933.79
else say it but I I accepted all right

928.87 --> 938.77
I guess with these dogs they don't they

933.79 --> 942.67
don't get that old so I think they're

938.77 --> 947.55
not so clingy to their physical life as

942.67 --> 947.55
much as regular humans tend to be

956.11 --> 963.85
anyway sorry about that bit of a sad

958.79 --> 968.02
news oh and oh happy birthday Jason

963.85 --> 968.02
on a more happy note

975.06 --> 977.75
all right

978.73 --> 981.33
yeah

984.09 --> 987.77
while I'm still 39

995.97 --> 1000.19
just like Owen Benjamin by the way

1016.03 --> 1024.31
right so I was on josé's again yesterday

1020.26 --> 1027.819
and even though it didn't go as smooth

1024.31 --> 1030.8799999999999
as as the day before I still got a

1027.819 --> 1038.579
decent conversation out of it here and

1030.88 --> 1038.5790000000002
there and ya know what's kind of good

1059.97 --> 1062.72
hmm

1067.68 --> 1076.76
settin iliyan shadow what is that low

1074.43 --> 1076.76
clean

1085.26 --> 1089.02
hmm

1087.24 --> 1092.18
interesting

1089.02 --> 1092.18
[Music]

1128.98 --> 1135.82
hmm oh by the way thanks thanks

1132.4 --> 1139.3600000000001
mind-warped what is going on

1135.82 --> 1144.37
where are the debates what happened I

1139.36 --> 1146.7299999999998
only see these restream things is it

1144.37 --> 1146.7299999999998
ended

1153.47 --> 1160.22
no no it's not because right now I am

1157.94 --> 1163.909
seeing a hangout link from Nathan

1160.22 --> 1167.57
mastery jet so I guess the Flat Earth

1163.909 --> 1171.19
debates are gonna be back on it's really

1167.57 --> 1171.1899999999998
early to throw out the link by the way

1180.34 --> 1183.34
cool

1188.75 --> 1191.68
hmm

1200.96 --> 1207.5900000000001
mm-hmm yeah gleam yeah that's the funny

1204.78 --> 1210.57
thing about Globus when things seemed

1207.59 --> 1213.33
geometrically inconsistent they just

1210.57 --> 1214.83
presume that it both has to be a globe

1213.33 --> 1216.72
and that what you're seeing should be

1214.83 --> 1220.05
possible on a globe so they just find

1216.72 --> 1222.15
some kind of cockamamie excuse is how

1220.05 --> 1229.95
everything warps around in order for

1222.15 --> 1232.02
that to be like that on a globe so

1229.95 --> 1234.03
they'll always find some kind of weird

1232.02 --> 1238.41
explanation of how it's supposed to work

1234.03 --> 1244.77
and they will literally suggest surreal

1238.41 --> 1250.5
things being normal in order to make it

1244.77 --> 1254.4
happen they'll lean on the mega

1250.5 --> 1257.66
exception to be the standard what's

1254.4 --> 1257.66
there that's what they always do

1269.43 --> 1274.29
now that's but that's that's really

1272.49 --> 1281.1
funny is that happy that you say that

1274.29 --> 1285.54
because we don't really need any reasons

1281.1 --> 1289.8799999999999
for things disappearing bottom up we

1285.54 --> 1294.93
just need to figure out or perhaps

1289.88 --> 1299.73
declare it a law of it happening no

1294.93 --> 1302.94
matter the contour or the geometry of

1299.73 --> 1305.43
the object you're looking over so

1302.94 --> 1309.6000000000001
including flat and when you conclude

1305.43 --> 1312.9
that concealment naturally is a part of

1309.6 --> 1316.83
optics when you look over a surface of

1312.9 --> 1319.8000000000002
any type into the distance at a certain

1316.83 --> 1322.3799999999999
proximity to that surface then you will

1319.8 --> 1326.82
see that consumer and that always

1322.38 --> 1330.15
happens and because you can figure out

1326.82 --> 1333.21
that it always happens like always it

1330.15 --> 1335.5500000000002
will happen inevitably if the viewer is

1333.21 --> 1338.07
low enough to the surface it always

1335.55 --> 1340.8899999999999
happens so you could say this is natural

1338.07 --> 1345.03
this is a natural law it doesn't matter

1340.89 --> 1347.1000000000001
what causes it even though you can well

1345.03 --> 1350.58
very manipulate for example to hide in a

1347.1 --> 1356.54
figure out hey it migrates as an effect

1350.58 --> 1363.6899999999998
as an optical effect but

1356.54 --> 1366.99
it is there so - then sidestep all that

1363.69 --> 1371.97
and say but that consume when this

1366.99 --> 1374.3700000000001
curvature look it looks like curvature

1371.97 --> 1378.179
if you just imagine it that it that that

1374.37 --> 1381.9899999999998
it's that well that's really nice but

1378.179 --> 1385.2900000000002
that effect happens with everything it

1381.99 --> 1388.2
happens when you look past a very

1385.29 --> 1391.35
straight floor for a very long time it

1388.2 --> 1395.79
happens when you look past a tall very

1391.35 --> 1397.59
straight building it happens concealment

1395.79 --> 1403.98
happens so to claim that that is

1397.59 --> 1407.6399999999999
curvature seems to be a a willful

1403.98 --> 1410.94
illusion to accept that that that is

1407.64 --> 1413.0700000000002
curvature when it happens uniformly just

1410.94 --> 1417.42
it just happens doesn't really matter

1413.07 --> 1419.82
why it happens it happens happens no

1417.42 --> 1424.23
matter the geometry of the thing you're

1419.82 --> 1426.54
looking over if the distance is enough

1424.23 --> 1430.71
and the observer height is low enough to

1426.54 --> 1432.42
the surface then it happens so ah thank

1430.71 --> 1434.7
you by the way Amanda young for the five

1432.42 --> 1438.66
dollar super jet donation Aquarius are

1434.7 --> 1440.9
the best oh so they can also be the

1438.66 --> 1440.9
worst

1451.92 --> 1454.6100000000001
now

1456.7 --> 1464.8590000000002
now it's consuming and it happens it

1462.159 --> 1468.1290000000001
doesn't matter you're trying to say the

1464.859 --> 1470.23
cause it's refraction an effect an

1468.129 --> 1472.869
optical effect or curvature a

1470.23 --> 1475.419
geometrical effect you're suggesting the

1472.869 --> 1479.32
cause what I'm saying is no the effect

1475.419 --> 1482.5590000000002
happens always happens whether you look

1479.32 --> 1485.259
over a flat surface or over a slightly

1482.559 --> 1488.1689999999999
curved surface it happens and there's a

1485.259 --> 1490.1490000000001
very direct provable relation and

1488.169 --> 1494.499
empirically provable relation with that

1490.149 --> 1497.619
observer Heights and we're within view

1494.499 --> 1500.1390000000001
at what apparent distance the

1497.619 --> 1504.6689999999999
concealment effect starts to set in it's

1500.139 --> 1507.85
measurable so to claim a cause for that

1504.669 --> 1512.409
being something specific it it becomes

1507.85 --> 1516.4289999999999
irrelevant because it always happens so

1512.409 --> 1522.1290000000001
how would you disprove a theory like

1516.429 --> 1526.21
that like right so the theory would be

1522.129 --> 1528.58
okay the horizon that cutoff points that

1526.21 --> 1531.539
consume n't is because it is a curve

1528.58 --> 1535.869
you're looking past and it cuts it off

1531.539 --> 1540.009
right so what if I don't say but look

1535.869 --> 1542.9499999999998
this is flat like the salt flats look

1540.009 --> 1545.6490000000001
the same effect happens kind of at the

1542.95 --> 1546.72
same distance this is confirmed flat how

1545.649 --> 1552.4889999999998
do you explain that

1546.72 --> 1556.499
so it works either what you can you can

1552.489 --> 1556.499
it you can disprove it

1559.09 --> 1565.9499999999998
it's not really a theory yet it's not

1561.43 --> 1570.7
scientific to even claim that but also

1565.95 --> 1573.13
yeah it is it's useless it the

1570.7 --> 1576.91
concealment effect happens no matter

1573.13 --> 1578.89
what you look over the observer Heights

1576.91 --> 1580.93
in proximity to the surface you're

1578.89 --> 1584.41
looking over is low enough and the

1580.93 --> 1586.6000000000001
distance of you looking past is long

1584.41 --> 1588.78
enough the effect will happen no matter

1586.6 --> 1588.78
what

1605.93 --> 1609.3700000000001
number that doesn't happen

1612.82 --> 1621.12
you can see very far but the thing is

1615.76 --> 1625.9
about that how far you can see the

1621.12 --> 1629.1599999999999
concealment rate is linear first yeah

1625.9 --> 1632.0800000000002
how much is concealed in literal height

1629.16 --> 1634.42
versus the distance of to the observer

1632.08 --> 1637.0
its linear so the further away you go

1634.42 --> 1641.92
the more is concealed and a linear rate

1637.0 --> 1643.48
and so even if under certain weather

1641.92 --> 1648.49
conditions for example you could see

1643.48 --> 1650.5
extremely unusually far when you look at

1648.49 --> 1652.18
for example an island that normally

1650.5 --> 1654.61
wouldn't be seen because the air clarity

1652.18 --> 1657.64
wouldn't allow it then you'd still not

1654.61 --> 1661.99
see the beaches you'd still just see the

1657.64 --> 1666.0700000000002
top of the hills there because it is

1661.99 --> 1670.18
still very far away and the consumer

1666.07 --> 1672.58
rate is linear so you'll never see even

1670.18 --> 1674.8
if you happen to see something of that

1672.58 --> 1677.02
very far distance thing because their

1674.8 --> 1681.43
clarity is suddenly clear enough you'll

1677.02 --> 1683.74
still not see much of the bottom even

1681.43 --> 1685.96
though for example you're looking past

1683.74 --> 1688.63
another islands that's much closer by

1685.96 --> 1692.71
that is always visible you will see most

1688.63 --> 1694.5100000000002
of the beaches on that part but the one

1692.71 --> 1696.58
much further away you'll never see that

1694.51 --> 1699.43
because it is so much further away and

1696.58 --> 1702.4199999999998
the concealment rate builds up linearly

1699.43 --> 1702.42
over distance

1714.74 --> 1717.34
it

1725.23 --> 1731.03
now Delphis Spacely I have no idea where

1728.63 --> 1733.16
you're getting that idea from that the

1731.03 --> 1737.3899999999999
top of the ship shoots shrink at the

1733.16 --> 1741.8000000000002
same rate as the bottom no now it

1737.39 --> 1744.0200000000002
becomes concealed and as it goes further

1741.8 --> 1748.1
away it also becomes smaller due to

1744.02 --> 1753.49
perspective by the way but no it

1748.1 --> 1755.1499999999999
shouldn't the concealment is bottom up

1753.49 --> 1758.21
that's just it

1755.15 --> 1764.1200000000001
that's how it works that's how it

1758.21 --> 1767.6000000000001
appears to manifest or bottom up if

1764.12 --> 1769.61
you'd look say pass the bottom of a

1767.6 --> 1773.57
bridge reaching very far then it'd be

1769.61 --> 1775.79
top down any concealment when looking

1773.57 --> 1777.53
past the bridge underneath it then it

1775.79 --> 1781.04
will be top down and if you're looking

1777.53 --> 1784.34
past the side of something then it will

1781.04 --> 1788.33
be side now yeah from the right side it

1784.34 --> 1795.02
would be right up it depends on the

1788.33 --> 1797.09
orientation of the viewer but the

1795.02 --> 1800.57
concealment will always come from the

1797.09 --> 1803.6299999999999
direction of the plane you're looking

1800.57 --> 1806.33
past of the object you're looking past

1803.63 --> 1809.5700000000002
that is where the concealment rate will

1806.33 --> 1812.57
start that is where things will this

1809.57 --> 1816.9099999999999
will be concealed that are to the side

1812.57 --> 1816.9099999999999
of it or on top of it or against it

1838.97 --> 1844.07
all right back and forth I see

1854.62 --> 1861.35
right Zep tepi well you look a lot of

1858.409 --> 1863.8400000000001
flat earthers are just trying things out

1861.35 --> 1867.1999999999998
they get a huge box of Lego's

1863.84 --> 1869.4499999999998
and to make a complete picture with that

1867.2 --> 1871.52
entire box of Lego's is very difficult

1869.45 --> 1873.1100000000001
so a lot of flat earthers are just

1871.52 --> 1876.2
building with things that they think

1873.11 --> 1879.9089999999999
they get and then sometimes they take

1876.2 --> 1882.559
wrong arguments and then they're not

1879.909 --> 1884.029
informed in detail about that yet

1882.559 --> 1888.02
because they haven't gotten there or

1884.029 --> 1890.24
they just can't get it to stick so yeah

1888.02 --> 1893.33
there are individuals all trying to make

1890.24 --> 1895.76
sense of it by their own skills and

1893.33 --> 1898.34
standards and talents so it's not

1895.76 --> 1901.58
surprising that they that's not all

1898.34 --> 1904.07
uniform okay we don't have like a book

1901.58 --> 1906.649
that we all learn that we all base our

1904.07 --> 1909.1399999999999
information on no we are all figuring it

1906.649 --> 1911.4399999999998
out as we go that's what we have been

1909.14 --> 1911.44
doing

1920.53 --> 1924.27
are you talking about white bear

1930.059 --> 1933.649
that's a strange thing to say

1944.21 --> 1951.32
oh yeah by the way talking about laws

1948.019 --> 1956.44
and laws within the context of science

1951.32 --> 1959.269
because Feynman he talks a lot about

1956.44 --> 1962.44
about all kinds of difference of laws

1959.269 --> 1965.84
and even says look this here thing

1962.44 --> 1968.72
breaks that law proves that it's not

1965.84 --> 1973.249
possible blah blah blah mathematics so

1968.72 --> 1977.269
much yeah stuff and so I'm just

1973.249 --> 1983.169
wondering if what is what are these laws

1977.269 --> 1986.029
even I wonder sometimes if we've

1983.169 --> 1989.69
misunderstood it a little because there

1986.029 --> 1991.549
seem to be laws in various position and

1989.69 --> 1996.409
they all have this function of okay this

1991.549 --> 1999.889
just seems to work like this it's almost

1996.409 --> 2003.159
impossible or simply impossible to

1999.889 --> 2005.9189999999999
disprove it so that's going to be an

2003.159 --> 2009.009
anchor and that's even how the law of

2005.919 --> 2013.3300000000002
gravitation was originally accepted but

2009.009 --> 2018.1490000000001
it's only within the setting of the

2013.33 --> 2021.34
things that it deals with within that

2018.149 --> 2025.6589999999999
within that sandbox within that specific

2021.34 --> 2028.629
region it's it's a bit confusing to me

2025.659 --> 2031.95
because there seemed to be all kinds of

2028.629 --> 2031.9499999999998
laws all over the place

2036.25 --> 2043.45
and it just makes me feel like the way

2040.45 --> 2045.73
that I've accepted it kind of works I

2043.45 --> 2050.169
think that John's explanations have been

2045.73 --> 2052.81
very fitting but I still need to look a

2050.169 --> 2054.609
bit further because there's there's

2052.81 --> 2058.389
something I'm missing there's something

2054.609 --> 2060.5789999999997
more there is another angle to this

2058.389 --> 2063.429
concept of laws that I'm not fully

2060.579 --> 2065.44
getting yet that I'm still did a little

2063.429 --> 2073.06
bit fuzzy about and so I'm gonna keep

2065.44 --> 2075.609
digging and figure this out what what

2073.06 --> 2078.27
are laws in science

2075.609 --> 2078.27
really

2085.06 --> 2092.32
and also it would be good to see any

2089.52 --> 2096.79
historical references as to how these

2092.32 --> 2099.82
laws were established like literally who

2096.79 --> 2102.94
came up with it and how did they argue

2099.82 --> 2105.54
it and how was it then agreed upon I

2102.94 --> 2109.11
want to know these things that's very

2105.54 --> 2111.93
important that's the ground works for

2109.11 --> 2115.6200000000003
giant piles of information it's

2111.93 --> 2115.62
important these details

2127.82 --> 2134.57
djay Flat Earth I think what you're

2131.4 --> 2139.4300000000003
talking about is probably not scientific

2134.57 --> 2139.4300000000003
isn't that just a statistical thing

2160.48 --> 2165.92
look white bear you're missing the point

2163.25 --> 2169.82
you that's so funny you completely

2165.92 --> 2172.46
missed out on the point the ball earth

2169.82 --> 2175.81
suggests there's a reason for consuming

2172.46 --> 2176.9900000000002
but that's a false reason because

2175.81 --> 2182.69
concealment

2176.99 --> 2188.14
happens no matter what if the conditions

2182.69 --> 2188.14
are met why don't you get this

2206.57 --> 2214.76
and by the way yeah I'm not making up

2210.68 --> 2217.22
laws I'm simply establishing things like

2214.76 --> 2224.71
come the effect of concealment and that

2217.22 --> 2224.7099999999996
it always is there and pretty sure it is

2225.34 --> 2230.42
yes and we have tested it

2228.5 --> 2233.36
oh I personally haven't because I have

2230.42 --> 2236.0
camera that's worth nothing but I

2233.36 --> 2237.26
remember on the debates Nathan did some

2236.0 --> 2240.2
filming himself

2237.26 --> 2242.2400000000002
remember the football field and other

2240.2 --> 2244.73
people on the debates also met her on

2242.24 --> 2248.0899999999997
movies Travis made some movies Jose made

2244.73 --> 2250.91
there were so many tests to figure out

2248.09 --> 2253.03
this concealment and the Mirage in

2250.91 --> 2258.2799999999997
affectional well that's a big part of it

2253.03 --> 2261.92
so yes there's a lot of evidence that

2258.28 --> 2264.65
concealment happens even if you look

2261.92 --> 2268.67
over a confirmed flat surface it just

2264.65 --> 2271.82
happens if the proximity of the observer

2268.67 --> 2274.79
is low enough to the surface you're

2271.82 --> 2278.3900000000003
looking over and the distance is far

2274.79 --> 2280.99
away enough concealment will happen it's

2278.39 --> 2280.99
as simple as that

2289.12 --> 2292.65
no no he didn't

2297.41 --> 2304.5099999999998
no no no he didn't time for you to go

2307.58 --> 2310.719
[Music]

2325.5 --> 2335.46
no it wasn't Daniel and besides it

2333.329 --> 2337.76
wasn't even one test he did like three

2335.46 --> 2337.76
things

2347.71 --> 2350.809
[Music]

2353.19 --> 2357.78
any more false accusations

2392.279 --> 2400.979
no now actually I remember that Sept

2395.439 --> 2403.899
happy when Randy did it twice one time

2400.979 --> 2407.589
there was indeed consuming and the other

2403.899 --> 2411.0989999999997
time there wasn't I think it was because

2407.589 --> 2413.739
there was a lot of heat or it or it

2411.099 --> 2415.809
lacked so yeah temperature does

2413.739 --> 2421.179
definitely influence and hey if the

2415.809 --> 2425.0190000000002
distance is not long enough and you

2421.179 --> 2427.659
might not get it consuming depending on

2425.019 --> 2430.9289999999996
the overall conditions it's guaranteed

2427.659 --> 2433.929
though that if the distance is a little

2430.929 --> 2437.0190000000002
bigger or just generally fast enough or

2433.929 --> 2445.89
if the observer goes low enough there

2437.019 --> 2445.89
will be consuming now because you know

2446.489 --> 2450.149
piece of Apple

2481.99 --> 2485.0699999999997
[Music]

2487.75 --> 2490.75
yeah

2491.81 --> 2498.54
well look this entire discussion is just

2495.45 --> 2501.24
completely pointless because I don't

2498.54 --> 2502.92
have the ability to give you any

2501.24 --> 2507.1189999999997
physical proof for this because I don't

2502.92 --> 2510.78
have a camera if I had I could I could

2507.119 --> 2515.4900000000002
do it right here the streets in a

2510.78 --> 2519.69
hallway in the staircase do it all over

2515.49 --> 2522.81
the place show you how concealment

2519.69 --> 2523.56
always manifests when you look past a

2522.81 --> 2525.54
flat surface

2523.56 --> 2529.5
if the proximity of the observer is

2525.54 --> 2532.5
close enough to that surface I'd love to

2529.5 --> 2534.24
do it but until then I can only forward

2532.5 --> 2536.82
you example of other people and then

2534.24 --> 2539.97
here you all you bow lowers wine and

2536.82 --> 2544.29
complaining yes no really to me thank ya

2539.97 --> 2546.45
cuz it can't be it can't be it has to be

2544.29 --> 2552.72
faulty it has to not be there it has to

2546.45 --> 2556.2
all be not there somehow so you can have

2552.72 --> 2559.08
your freakin curve of a ball you want to

2556.2 --> 2561.83
be looking at when you look in the

2559.08 --> 2565.5299999999997
distant isn't it that's it isn't it

2561.83 --> 2569.609
because it has to be that girl it just

2565.53 --> 2571.9100000000003
has to be or there's no reason for a

2569.609 --> 2571.91
living

2578.95 --> 2585.3999999999996
get me the camera and you can complain

2581.74 --> 2588.0
and whine to me all day about how I

2585.4 --> 2591.069
didn't do it right and now I've been

2588.0 --> 2593.559
tricking everyone and I did everything

2591.069 --> 2595.21
wrong I didn't prove consumed and even

2593.559 --> 2598.75
though everything I did did prove

2595.21 --> 2601.18
concealment but yeah if you want to get

2598.75 --> 2603.609
to that stage you're gonna have to help

2601.18 --> 2608.2799999999997
me out by donating to my girl fund me

2603.609 --> 2608.2799999999997
and then I can do that and I will

2636.63 --> 2644.9500000000003
yeah it's because you're disagreeing

2642.07 --> 2655.84
without an argument white bear that's

2644.95 --> 2660.6
why and because it's always the same

2655.84 --> 2663.76
[ __ ] the word tests them live

2660.6 --> 2667.0899999999997
on-the-spot several times and just the

2663.76 --> 2669.1000000000004
ballers always whining every one of them

2667.09 --> 2672.46
even the guys that are actually kind of

2669.1 --> 2678.04
respect now they have to whine that it's

2672.46 --> 2681.01
all faulty it's not real because if they

2678.04 --> 2683.38
let it in if there is a possibility that

2681.01 --> 2685.69
when they look into the distance and

2683.38 --> 2687.58
it's not the freaking edge of a curve

2685.69 --> 2690.1
they're looking past then there's no

2687.58 --> 2692.7599999999998
more reason for living apparently for

2690.1 --> 2692.7599999999998
these people

2703.21 --> 2706.7400000000002
yeah Daniel

2725.96 --> 2730.01
maybe I'm just getting to the point

2727.9 --> 2732.89
because this is the only point that

2730.01 --> 2736.46
there's left really when you deal with

2732.89 --> 2739.67
people that are religiously incapable of

2736.46 --> 2745.48
accepting an argument religiously

2739.67 --> 2748.13
incapable then I get really angry and

2745.48 --> 2750.41
you got to be happy at this point or not

2748.13 --> 2752.4500000000003
or you go to think whatever you like

2750.41 --> 2756.14
that I'm not just outright banning you

2752.45 --> 2758.359
all including you Daniel because it

2756.14 --> 2762.3799999999997
really pisses me off you're this

2758.359 --> 2764.72
freaking indoctrinated it hurts because

2762.38 --> 2767.42
I also know that you do have good sides

2764.72 --> 2770.75
and you're creative and all that but no

2767.42 --> 2773.329
no this point right here no there's no

2770.75 --> 2780.109
flexibility there you have no control

2773.329 --> 2784.059
over that at all it's set it's set how

2780.109 --> 2784.0589999999997
you have to respond you have no choice

2785.27 --> 2788.32
[Music]

2794.67 --> 2806.65
hmm oh that's a tough one day I if you

2803.859 --> 2812.25
mean respect a hundred percent then I'd

2806.65 --> 2816.78
have to disappointingly say zero but

2812.25 --> 2821.65
there is just a percentage of tenability

2816.78 --> 2823.96
how much is it possible to actually have

2821.65 --> 2826.589
an active or creative conversation with

2823.96 --> 2831.099
somebody versus their neurotic side and

2826.589 --> 2835.45
trumpeting and trolling and then just

2831.099 --> 2838.869
weigh it off that's and if you're lucky

2835.45 --> 2841.66
then that that baller is actually taking

2838.869 --> 2843.73
it very serious that they need to get a

2841.66 --> 2847.93
grip over themselves and everyone does

2843.73 --> 2850.9900000000002
and then I'll have more respect for them

2847.93 --> 2853.1189999999997
as long as they do that tips keep

2850.99 --> 2855.49
sticking to that and that is also why I

2853.119 --> 2859.329
kind of like josé's because I do try to

2855.49 --> 2862.0
input that and they do accept it and I

2859.329 --> 2866.799
do feel that they're really doing that

2862.0 --> 2868.69
then it's not just oh yeah and just ruin

2866.799 --> 2870.52
it no that's good

2868.69 --> 2872.98
that gives me some respect for them even

2870.52 --> 2875.799
though they are very indoctrinated and

2872.98 --> 2882.01
very very overconfident with certain

2875.799 --> 2888.0099999999998
things but yeah so it's always a it's a

2882.01 --> 2891.9700000000003
it's always going to be a mix now you

2888.01 --> 2900.119
know what there's one baller that I do

2891.97 --> 2904.1189999999997
really fully acts respect and that is my

2900.119 --> 2911.279
librarian friend who is definitely a

2904.119 --> 2913.9300000000003
baller but can absolutely accept my

2911.279 --> 2916.779
doubts my train of thought even my

2913.93 --> 2920.319
reconstruction of science who can come

2916.779 --> 2922.359
with me in that so yes but that's pretty

2920.319 --> 2924.43
much the only person that I know is

2922.359 --> 2926.64
really a baller instead tries to stay a

2924.43 --> 2929.489
baller

2926.64 --> 2932.549
that I really respect because it's just

2929.489 --> 2934.7690000000002
really tough mostly I just end up

2932.549 --> 2938.749
avoiding the subject if I want to be

2934.769 --> 2938.749
able to deal with those individuals

2941.54 --> 2944.65
[Music]

2971.81 --> 2977.74
all right

2974.48 --> 2977.7400000000002
of course they are Daniel

3007.99 --> 3017.18
the obvious requirements well the office

3013.009 --> 3022.73
requirements are very simple you have a

3017.18 --> 3024.799
surface to look over and well if you can

3022.73 --> 3028.4900000000002
absolutely confirm it as flat that's

3024.799 --> 3031.549
nice but really doesn't matter at all at

3028.49 --> 3035.3289999999997
all as long as you know it is a surface

3031.549 --> 3038.63
and it is pretty persistent whatever

3035.329 --> 3040.819
shape it is and then you need a camera

3038.63 --> 3045.4100000000003
and you need to be sure that it is

3040.819 --> 3051.65
perfectly straight that you can place it

3045.41 --> 3054.799
in a level way perfectly and then you

3051.65 --> 3057.38
test it height versus the concealment

3054.799 --> 3060.519
effect if there is any that you'd expect

3057.38 --> 3064.4300000000003
there to be some as long as the

3060.519 --> 3067.7299999999996
proximity to the to the surface is close

3064.43 --> 3069.9199999999996
enough versus the distance so there will

3067.73 --> 3071.75
always be a point where if you raise the

3069.92 --> 3072.44
camera high up enough there will be no

3071.75 --> 3074.75
concealment

3072.44 --> 3077.96
Oh surprise surprise but then again if

3074.75 --> 3080.569
you move it back down there will almost

3077.96 --> 3083.41
always be a point when there will be

3080.569 --> 3083.41
concealment

3087.47 --> 3095.839
I already am is it cause I is flat I

3092.75 --> 3098.839
have a GoFundMe for a p900 I think it's

3095.839 --> 3103.21
still no there's a p1000 but I want to

3098.839 --> 3103.21
be 900 because the p1000 is just too big

3117.88 --> 3127.58
yeah looking forward to it myself white

3121.28 --> 3128.69
bear so yeah if anybody else wants me to

3127.58 --> 3131.71
yeah

3128.69 --> 3134.53
be able to do that spend some time

3131.71 --> 3139.79
filming stuff doing some optical

3134.53 --> 3142.88
experiments you know what to do support

3139.79 --> 3145.58
me through my GoFundMe now you can find

3142.88 --> 3151.73
it in the description box of my youtube

3145.58 --> 3156.52
there's a direct link just click it send

3151.73 --> 3160.25
whatever you got there and I will get it

3156.52 --> 3164.12
below yeah it's still set to the p1000

3160.25 --> 3170.29
with a relatively high price I I'm gonna

3164.12 --> 3170.29
have to did I update it let me see

3175.789 --> 3190.029
okay sit still now it's still set to the

3179.839 --> 3190.029
old price I got a fix that anyway

3205.049 --> 3210.779
I have no idea what you're talking about

3207.269 --> 3215.0989999999997
Daniel but please drop stop trying to

3210.779 --> 3217.349
put opinions or ideas of what I'm

3215.099 --> 3221.219
supposed to be doing right now it out

3217.349 --> 3226.9790000000003
there about what I'm doing because I'm

3221.219 --> 3229.0190000000002
just not that interested and if it is

3226.979 --> 3233.39
really special sure I'll take a look at

3229.019 --> 3236.8799999999997
again because I probably did that's fine

3233.39 --> 3240.029
but I'm not dismissing anything I am

3236.88 --> 3244.0190000000002
simply saying there will be concealment

3240.029 --> 3248.009
the observer heights is close enough to

3244.019 --> 3250.3089999999997
the surface you're looking over that's

3248.009 --> 3250.309
it

3271.22 --> 3276.7599999999998
no and it's not obstruction I'm talking

3275.18 --> 3279.2
about concealment

3276.76 --> 3281.3900000000003
now talking about physical things

3279.2 --> 3284.66
obstructing other things in the distance

3281.39 --> 3287.359
like the tidal bulge which is something

3284.66 --> 3289.79
that ranty figured out that that's there

3287.359 --> 3292.75
that that's actually there officially

3289.79 --> 3296.74
that's obstruction now I'm talking about

3292.75 --> 3300.02
concealment which is optical um

3296.74 --> 3304.04
something just disappears out of sight

3300.02 --> 3308.359
it's removed from sight naturally due to

3304.04 --> 3311.96
the nature of sight itself and I'm not

3308.359 --> 3316.73
trying to mechanically unravel the cause

3311.96 --> 3318.619
you love to always always that freaking

3316.73 --> 3322.72
cause now I'm just establishing that it

3318.619 --> 3322.7200000000003
always happens that's what I do

3334.39 --> 3338.35
I don't know mark color I think a lot of

3336.91 --> 3342.58
people are probably listening in the

3338.35 --> 3345.22
distance and sometimes checking in it's

3342.58 --> 3350.2599999999998
not like I'm continually talking having

3345.22 --> 3353.6499999999996
a proper conversation to just listen to

3350.26 --> 3355.96
so I do expect people or maybe trying to

3353.65 --> 3358.15
ask some questions here and there and or

3355.96 --> 3362.73
are literally following what you guys

3358.15 --> 3362.73
are talking about guys and gals

3383.05 --> 3392.82
you're not listening again it's like I

3386.86 --> 3395.8
keep on saying proximity height distance

3392.82 --> 3398.71
remember the height of the viewer versus

3395.8 --> 3401.71
distance so yeah I already said if the

3398.71 --> 3403.93
observer height is too high in relation

3401.71 --> 3406.0
to the distance of the surface you're

3403.93 --> 3412.02
looking over consume one's not gonna

3406.0 --> 3416.08
manifest distance has to be long enough

3412.02 --> 3422.8
for ya with the observer height combined

3416.08 --> 3425.3199999999997
in order for that to manifest so yeah if

3422.8 --> 3429.369
he did certain videos and it didn't work

3425.32 --> 3432.46
well then did he have the camera

3429.369 --> 3435.8500000000004
literally in the floor and he didn't

3432.46 --> 3440.85
manifest probably not it was probably

3435.85 --> 3440.85
some height above it well there you go

3442.44 --> 3449.23
so you're being chaired y-yeah you're

3446.14 --> 3451.9
cherry-picking here just saying no it

3449.23 --> 3455.2
didn't happen and you're not putting the

3451.9 --> 3460.23
system together of why it wouldn't be

3455.2 --> 3460.23
happening or what it is

3465.73 --> 3475.91
400 meters okay I'd love to see that

3475.22 --> 3478.64
again

3475.91 --> 3482.17
and I'll be the judge of how high that

3478.64 --> 3488.21
is I won't be able to make it out a

3482.17 --> 3494.86
hundred meters that's that's not super

3488.21 --> 3494.86
far right

3513.88 --> 3519.31
that's fine conspiracy cats are not

3516.16 --> 3521.3199999999997
claiming that I'm not claiming a cause

3519.31 --> 3525.5499999999997
I'm simply establishing that it does

3521.32 --> 3528.5800000000004
happen when the conditions are met which

3525.55 --> 3533.05
is a relational condition again observer

3528.58 --> 3539.16
height versus the distance of the

3533.05 --> 3539.1600000000003
surface you're looking over that's it

3549.94 --> 3552.69
you know

3556.079 --> 3562.759
well that's too bad for you then Daniel

3558.719 --> 3562.759
if you don't like it then [ __ ] off

3569.24 --> 3573.9199999999996
go complain about it to somebody else

3584.09 --> 3593.15
no anymore

3609.16 --> 3611.94
good

3614.84 --> 3629.42
oh no it's great I love it especially

3626.14 --> 3632.71
people that complain about it I love it

3629.42 --> 3636.79
there's nothing more satisfying than

3632.71 --> 3642.76
banning people that are whining about

3636.79 --> 3642.7599999999998
banning people love it so bring it on

3670.57 --> 3675.4300000000003
Whitebear have you considered that

3673.24 --> 3677.9399999999996
comment like that may get you banned at

3675.43 --> 3677.94
this point

3689.49 --> 3693.74
I just want to know before I ban you

3708.32 --> 3711.01
nope

3711.2 --> 3715.81
okay well I'm gonna ban you anyway

3719.21 --> 3729.26
oh oh thank you
