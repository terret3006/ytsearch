92.0 --> 101.84

93.28 --> 101.84
it's pretty nice and clear weather

fill that up with some hot water for my

168.84 --> 171.84
tea

176.4 --> 180.31900000000002
and it's hot again

178.17 --> 184.07999999999998
[Music]

180.319 --> 187.04
all right so

184.08 --> 187.04000000000002
it's wednesday

191.12 --> 195.20000000000002
not in the best of moods just

196.84 --> 201.44
big

199.28 --> 201.44
just

205.84 --> 209.519
i've got a lot of dissatisfaction to

208.239 --> 212.48000000000002
deal with

209.519 --> 227.84
especially in relation to the world what

212.48 --> 227.83999999999997
am i i'm supposed to be doing in it

232.72 --> 237.28
right let's not leave a pause after that

234.64 --> 239.599
for too long

237.28 --> 241.28
it's just that i don't know man i got a

239.599 --> 244.159
lot of problems with

241.28 --> 244.159
my instincts

244.64 --> 249.92
because in ways i'm not really handling

247.92 --> 252.79899999999998
all of this well

249.92 --> 255.76
like what's been happening especially in

252.799 --> 260.959
the last few weeks

255.76 --> 260.959
but even last year and

266.08 --> 269.919
just it everything is pushing to a

268.24 --> 273.199
breaking point

269.919 --> 275.52
and and even that breaking point is no

273.199 --> 276.8
promise of release it's just a breaking

275.52 --> 280.32
point

276.8 --> 280.32
and i'm just really

281.6 --> 285.759
getting stressed out about it sometimes

287.04 --> 290.72
it's like what am i going to do with all

289.36 --> 293.6
this with

290.72 --> 294.88000000000005
who i am i've been going through

293.6 --> 296.88
everything

294.88 --> 298.15999999999997
because it just gives me the feeling a

296.88 --> 300.4
sensation which is

298.16 --> 301.199
very demoralizing that it is literally

300.4 --> 304.479
all

301.199 --> 307.44
has been for nothing that it like if

304.479 --> 309.52
everything just turns to [ __ ] then it

307.44 --> 311.28
doesn't really matter

309.52 --> 312.96
doesn't even matter what i'm doing here

311.28 --> 315.84
because eventually

312.96 --> 317.75899999999996
the entire process of learning at all

315.84 --> 325.84
and wanting to know

317.759 --> 325.84000000000003
will just go away

331.36 --> 341.12
mark smiley look implants in vaccines

336.479 --> 343.75899999999996
just don't take it and as far as i know

341.12 --> 345.6
far as it's looking right now nobody's

343.759 --> 346.88
actually going to be forcing anyone

345.6 --> 347.759
they're just going to be mind

346.88 --> 349.6
controlling you

347.759 --> 352.16
into giving you an impression there is

349.6 --> 355.6
no other choice

352.16 --> 358.639
it's like oh either you lose everything

355.6 --> 361.36
or make make you believe you will lose

358.639 --> 364.08
everything or take the vaccine well

361.36 --> 365.039
don't believe it because if you really

364.08 --> 366.56
have to take it

365.039 --> 369.36
and there's nothing in the world that

366.56 --> 371.759
can stop it well then everything is just

369.36 --> 373.039
[ __ ] then it's just the end and

371.759 --> 375.44
there's nothing really

373.039 --> 376.639
you're gonna do about it anyway what

375.44 --> 378.84
more protesting

376.639 --> 380.479
well that's just made more and more

378.84 --> 383.919
impossible and

380.479 --> 386.71999999999997
hasn't really changed anything last time

383.919 --> 388.88
protesting actually changed anything

386.72 --> 391.52000000000004
was the time basically when the people

388.88 --> 395.36
currently in power got in power

391.52 --> 399.919
they just used the protest as a as a hop

395.36 --> 403.039
stool to get in their power positions

399.919 --> 409.84
that they are not relinquishing

403.039 --> 409.84
it's all [ __ ]

417.38 --> 420.519
[Music]

420.84 --> 423.84
do

428.639 --> 433.039
mark smiler i've been talking about that

430.72 --> 434.72
[ __ ] three years ago i don't know why

433.039 --> 439.919
you're whining about that

434.72 --> 439.91900000000004
like it's some new information it's not

442.479 --> 448.56
vaccines are bad we know i'm an

444.96 --> 451.84
anti-vaxxer i have been for a long time

448.56 --> 451.84
so this is not new

458.08 --> 463.19899999999996
what you think my show is just a

460.639 --> 466.319
speaking point where i just oh

463.199 --> 466.879
let me get the couple of lines that i

466.319 --> 470.08000000000004
need to

466.879 --> 471.759
output for the day according to the

470.08 --> 474.56
program

471.759 --> 476.879
because i am just a speaking point i'm

474.56 --> 479.599
just here to echo a certain level of

476.879 --> 480.24
narrative for people to tag on to and

479.599 --> 482.4
then

480.24 --> 483.28000000000003
be part of the system that way you think

482.4 --> 488.15999999999997
that

483.28 --> 491.19899999999996
that is what i am sometimes i wonder

488.16 --> 492.24
though am i i'm not really reading from

491.199 --> 495.759
a script

492.24 --> 498.319
i'm literally just doing everything live

495.759 --> 500.0
and i do make notes about what i did and

498.319 --> 502.0
that's about it

500.0 --> 503.44
i don't have a narrative script it's

502.0 --> 506.319
just sometimes

503.44 --> 508.4
a subject is very tannable to me and

506.319 --> 510.47900000000004
then i bring it forward hoping to

508.4 --> 512.8
improve upon it a little because i think

510.479 --> 516.64
it's natural and i think it's

512.8 --> 516.64
good and that's about it

519.36 --> 524.48
you got more i don't need more evidence

522.479 --> 529.0400000000001
mark smiley

524.48 --> 529.04
i don't need it anymore i already know

531.839 --> 534.8800000000001
i don't want to do presentations about

534.0 --> 536.8
that

534.88 --> 538.16
that shit's only gonna get my channel

536.8 --> 540.959
off air

538.16 --> 542.399
is that what you want yeah it's gonna be

540.959 --> 545.5189999999999
very easy for me to

542.399 --> 548.32
subtly break out get real and get like

545.519 --> 550.16
really in your face and start playing

548.32 --> 551.44
forbidden videos yeah and then i'll get

550.16 --> 554.3199999999999
my channel banned too

551.44 --> 555.9200000000001
oh that's gonna make me so happy that's

554.32 --> 558.9590000000001
just great because then i'm

555.92 --> 560.7199999999999
important too right and then people

558.959 --> 562.64
start taking notice because i finally

560.72 --> 564.32
get banned and then

562.64 --> 565.68
yeah and then i don't have the channel

564.32 --> 569.6
anymore and then

565.68 --> 572.64
people can't look up my stuff

569.6 --> 574.48
from in the past to confirm that what

572.64 --> 578.399
i'm talking about is actually

574.48 --> 581.04
like in a linear build up naturally or

578.399 --> 581.04
derived

582.08 --> 594.399
and then what

591.12 --> 594.399
i i just

597.04 --> 605.8389999999999
to make a phone call send an email

600.08 --> 605.839
what with what to do what mark smiley

606.32 --> 619.839
where the hell is everybody else

672.839 --> 675.839
uh

680.079 --> 684.3199999999999
yeah i get it mark smiler you done some

683.519 --> 686.72
research

684.32 --> 689.279
you got a document and you think it's

686.72 --> 690.8000000000001
very special

689.279 --> 693.76
it's not going to bring any new

690.8 --> 693.76
information though

698.88 --> 704.399
the peg you

702.48 --> 706.0
oh i'll just have to trust you well

704.399 --> 709.279
maybe

706.0 --> 710.16
i just have to ban you and start

709.279 --> 712.88
completely

710.16 --> 714.399
ignoring you because you're not making

712.88 --> 716.24
any point and the only thing you're

714.399 --> 719.04
trying to do is just

716.24 --> 721.6
get me on this breadcrumb path not

719.04 --> 723.92
leading anywhere

721.6 --> 730.399
nothing you said has been leading

723.92 --> 732.4799999999999
anywhere and i'm sick of it and you're

730.399 --> 734.24
filling my chat and i don't want you to

732.48 --> 736.24
feel my chat and i don't want you to

734.24 --> 738.32
feel my comment section either

736.24 --> 740.24
don't you just go away and do your own

738.32 --> 743.2
freaking videos how about that

740.24 --> 744.16
make your own damn videos if it's so

743.2 --> 759.839
important

744.16 --> 759.8389999999999
and stop nagging me with them

761.6 --> 766.639
but but he has information yeah i don't

770.839 --> 773.839
care

775.76 --> 782.88
i don't need some stupid little cube

778.88 --> 783.279
brewer who is the secret information

782.88 --> 787.8389999999999
just

783.279 --> 787.8389999999999
[ __ ] off

790.639 --> 794.5600000000001
hello by the way the random explorer

796.72 --> 801.839
right so yeah my mood not too great

819.199 --> 823.8389999999999
he's just trying to squirt i don't know

821.6 --> 826.839
what he's doing

823.839 --> 828.48
i think a whole lot of people are just

826.839 --> 831.839
completely

828.48 --> 831.839
demoralized i think

832.0 --> 835.199
i think that the way things have been

834.16 --> 838.3199999999999
arranged

835.199 --> 841.92
to happen and unfold i think it has a

838.32 --> 843.36
massive record level demoralization

841.92 --> 847.92
effect

843.36 --> 849.92
because everybody is just you yeah

847.92 --> 851.4399999999999
it's just made apparent even clear we

849.92 --> 853.36
are all being played

851.44 --> 855.839
we're all being played and there is not

853.36 --> 859.44
a [ __ ] thing we can do about it

855.839 --> 862.48
nothing it's just all a slow road

859.44 --> 864.1600000000001
to death there's nothing we can [ __ ]

862.48 --> 867.44
do about it it's not gonna change

864.16 --> 869.279
it's only gonna get worse

867.44 --> 870.5600000000001
and there's nothing that's gonna make

869.279 --> 873.4399999999999
them stop it

870.56 --> 875.279
from making it worse it's just gonna get

873.44 --> 877.9200000000001
worse there's not a [ __ ] thing i can

875.279 --> 877.92
do about it

879.36 --> 884.8000000000001
and i i don't want to pretend i don't

882.959 --> 887.8389999999999
want to pretend like i can do something

884.8 --> 887.8389999999999
about this [ __ ]

895.36 --> 900.0
it's it's just over america is a [ __ ]

898.56 --> 902.6389999999999
communist country

900.0 --> 902.639
it's over

903.36 --> 906.88
and everything else is now in going to

905.92 --> 909.5999999999999
in step

906.88 --> 911.76
in step lockstep with it and all the

909.6 --> 912.0
disgusting elements of the united states

911.76 --> 916.399
is

912.0 --> 919.36
going to once again command and enflare

916.399 --> 921.279
all the other [ __ ] liberal countries

919.36 --> 924.48
that are just gonna look for the next

921.279 --> 927.8389999999999
[ __ ] target to destroy because that's

924.48 --> 927.839
what it does

928.0 --> 931.199
and it's going to keep on going and

930.16 --> 934.639
going and going

931.199 --> 935.12
until every [ __ ] human being is

934.639 --> 938.16
either

935.12 --> 940.079
dead sterile

938.16 --> 942.24
or just out of their [ __ ] mind

940.079 --> 944.56
demonic self-destructive

942.24 --> 948.0
and they're not gonna stop i i'm very

944.56 --> 951.7589999999999
pessimistic at this moment

948.0 --> 954.16
because yeah what you're gonna do

951.759 --> 955.6
ignore it ignore everything just build

954.16 --> 957.36
something great

955.6 --> 959.44
ignoring everything even though you're

957.36 --> 961.519
constantly being slapped in the face

959.44 --> 963.2790000000001
no matter where you look even if you

961.519 --> 965.36
keep your eyes closed it's still gonna

963.279 --> 967.12
slap you in the face there's no escaping

965.36 --> 968.399
there's no escaping from your freaking

967.12 --> 971.839
dreams

968.399 --> 973.839
there's no st escaping anywhere

971.839 --> 975.6800000000001
you can't even escape in the lies

973.839 --> 978.48
anymore

975.68 --> 978.959
or well probably some people could but

978.48 --> 980.88
yet

978.959 --> 982.8
those lies are a part of it so if you

980.88 --> 985.68
try to escape you become a part of it

982.8 --> 987.4399999999999
and you make it worse

985.68 --> 989.68
and then eventually it'll twist your

987.44 --> 992.1600000000001
mind up so bad

989.68 --> 993.5999999999999
that you are just one of that you're

992.16 --> 995.519
just

993.6 --> 996.88
just like the freaking antifa out of

995.519 --> 1001.279
control

996.88 --> 1003.519
rage and they just rage it out

1001.279 --> 1005.199
do whatever they need as a virtual win

1003.519 --> 1007.279
they don't want to even

1005.199 --> 1008.4799999999999
these people don't actually even want to

1007.279 --> 1011.12
know

1008.48 --> 1011.6
what they are championing because when

1011.12 --> 1014.8
they

1011.6 --> 1018.48
figure it out they just think

1014.8 --> 1018.959
like this like um well at least i'll get

1018.48 --> 1022.0790000000001
what i

1018.959 --> 1022.079
deserve in the end

1025.039 --> 1028.0
that's what happens

1028.4 --> 1036.4
these people are so far away

1032.48 --> 1038.079
in the darkness that they want you to

1036.4 --> 1041.199
take them out of their misery because

1038.079 --> 1041.1989999999998
they can't anymore

1045.199 --> 1048.799
but even the entire plan is just worked

1047.439 --> 1052.48
around that to just

1048.799 --> 1054.48
make them into auto martyrs

1052.48 --> 1056.16
for the media to start squirting over

1054.48 --> 1059.52
and make things even worse so

1056.16 --> 1060.3200000000002
every [ __ ] little or big move you

1059.52 --> 1063.36
make

1060.32 --> 1064.3999999999999
against this communist world government

1063.36 --> 1066.559
system

1064.4 --> 1069.919
is only going to make it worse every

1066.559 --> 1073.039
single [ __ ] thing you can imagine

1069.919 --> 1074.88
there's nothing you could do and i don't

1073.039 --> 1076.96
even want to be saying this but i

1074.88 --> 1080.16
literally honestly don't know

1076.96 --> 1082.32
any more ways through and i've looked

1080.16 --> 1084.559
and i've looked i've looked my entire

1082.32 --> 1084.559
life

1086.08 --> 1090.72
the only way through is to not have

1089.12 --> 1094.3999999999999
empathy

1090.72 --> 1097.039
just literally let it all go to hell

1094.4 --> 1098.0
and somehow maintain some kind of logo

1097.039 --> 1099.6
structure

1098.0 --> 1101.919
even in the way you're acting even

1099.6 --> 1104.799
though every [ __ ] thing out there

1101.919 --> 1107.3600000000001
every person is getting infected with

1104.799 --> 1110.16
bad behavior gay behavior

1107.36 --> 1111.4399999999998
thinking in just twisted ways

1110.16 --> 1113.8400000000001
normalizing lies

1111.44 --> 1116.24
every [ __ ] thing out there is going

1113.84 --> 1117.6
to be infected by it and every person

1116.24 --> 1120.4
you know

1117.6 --> 1122.3999999999999
that is even trying is infected by it

1120.4 --> 1125.039
and getting infected by it is not

1122.4 --> 1125.6000000000001
a [ __ ] thing you could do to stop it

1125.039 --> 1130.64
and i'm

1125.6 --> 1130.6399999999999
really depressed about it right now

1133.84 --> 1139.76
i'm not even depressed it's not like i

1135.919 --> 1139.76
don't have energy it's just compressed

1140.64 --> 1143.5200000000002
and i don't know

1145.6 --> 1148.24
what to do

1148.72 --> 1152.72
except get ridiculous unify things in

1152.08 --> 1155.76
ways

1152.72 --> 1157.679
things refuse to be unified

1155.76 --> 1158.96
because everyone and everything would

1157.679 --> 1161.44
rather just

1158.96 --> 1164.16
quickly burn something up quickly

1161.44 --> 1165.44
sacrifice something that is trying so

1164.16 --> 1168.72
that you'll have a few

1165.44 --> 1172.4
less seconds of realizing you are

1168.72 --> 1172.88
absolutely [ __ ] everybody's just going

1172.4 --> 1176.3200000000002
to

1172.88 --> 1178.3200000000002
start targeting the only people that can

1176.32 --> 1178.6399999999999
actually do anything about it because

1178.32 --> 1181.9189999999999
just

1178.64 --> 1184.5590000000002
at some point the mere thought

1181.919 --> 1186.4
of hope just makes you realize how

1184.559 --> 1192.0
useless and worthless

1186.4 --> 1194.16
you are for not doing the same thing

1192.0 --> 1196.64
yeah that's going to be the general

1194.16 --> 1196.64
attitude

1202.4 --> 1205.52
and i don't feel like i'm helping at

1204.24 --> 1207.84
anything right now

1205.52 --> 1211.76
it i hope i'm not just making people

1207.84 --> 1211.76
absolutely miserable saying these things

1211.919 --> 1215.8400000000001
it's just at some point i just don't

1213.76 --> 1216.8799999999999
know what the [ __ ] do you even imagine

1215.84 --> 1220.32
anymore

1216.88 --> 1224.3200000000002
i don't even know where yeah

1220.32 --> 1226.48
this this this virtual play of trying to

1224.32 --> 1228.96
back engineer everything and trying to

1226.48 --> 1229.84
find some sensible road and give it out

1228.96 --> 1232.799
as an idea

1229.84 --> 1234.08
as an example oh yeah this very noble

1232.799 --> 1239.12
quest of mine

1234.08 --> 1239.12
yeah it's not doing anything anymore

1240.0 --> 1243.679
i don't know a way through it's all

1242.64 --> 1249.8400000000001
[ __ ]

1243.679 --> 1249.8400000000001
really savagely [ __ ]

1254.43 --> 1259.079
[Music]

1259.6 --> 1265.6
and then yeah sure there's there's

1261.919 --> 1269.2800000000002
little candle flames of goodness and

1265.6 --> 1272.32
unwavering spirit here and there yeah

1269.28 --> 1276.08
it's mostly feeding of naivety though

1272.32 --> 1278.8799999999999
of actual another a lie of hope which is

1276.08 --> 1280.96
just as bad because if you're going to

1278.88 --> 1283.8400000000001
erase pieces of reality

1280.96 --> 1285.76
and just to stay moral just to keep your

1283.84 --> 1288.08
moral up

1285.76 --> 1290.24
yeah guess what it's just a matter of

1288.08 --> 1291.6789999999999
time before that [ __ ] is chipped away

1290.24 --> 1294.24
too

1291.679 --> 1296.0
and then people are holding on to you

1294.24 --> 1297.84
for having that

1296.0 --> 1299.679
for being one of the last having that

1297.84 --> 1303.52
even though you really don't have

1299.679 --> 1306.0800000000002
any legitimate reason to be moral

1303.52 --> 1307.76
at that what to be have good moral good

1306.08 --> 1310.96
spirits

1307.76 --> 1319.84
so where is this going

1310.96 --> 1319.8400000000001
how how can this be stopped

1332.559 --> 1335.36
what the [ __ ]

1343.36 --> 1348.7199999999998
hello get it out what the [ __ ] seeking

1346.08 --> 1348.72
star wars

1351.52 --> 1355.36
is there anything funny about what i

1358.84 --> 1361.84
said

1363.13 --> 1375.44
[Music]

1395.84 --> 1402.08
i'm it's [ __ ] but

1398.88 --> 1404.42
you are not really i'm not [ __ ]

1402.08 --> 1407.559
tell me tell me how

1404.42 --> 1407.559
[Music]

1409.36 --> 1412.7199999999998
do you think i can really just normalize

1411.6 --> 1415.12
for myself

1412.72 --> 1416.96
the things that are happening out there

1415.12 --> 1418.8799999999999
it's like no i can't there's nothing you

1416.96 --> 1421.76
can do about you're just going to have

1418.88 --> 1422.7990000000002
to see as the spirit is slowly drained a

1421.76 --> 1425.919
little more from

1422.799 --> 1427.279
everyone and everything that they

1425.919 --> 1430.0
spiritually just

1427.279 --> 1431.76
struggle to survive to find some kind of

1430.0 --> 1434.159
new cohesion

1431.76 --> 1437.2
after being forced to relinquish another

1434.159 --> 1437.2
part of your spirit

1441.36 --> 1444.9599999999998
until everybody finds the new position

1443.6 --> 1447.12
that they can survive

1444.96 --> 1448.0
at and then they're just going to attack

1447.12 --> 1452.3999999999999
anybody that

1448.0 --> 1452.4
hasn't been able to adapt to it

1453.36 --> 1456.4799999999998
because now they're the bad man you have

1455.12 --> 1460.32
to adapt see

1456.48 --> 1463.1200000000001
everything forces you to go down into it

1460.32 --> 1465.84
down that path into absolute destruction

1463.12 --> 1465.84
everything

1471.52 --> 1477.12
how far are you willing to adapt

1474.64 --> 1478.88
until there's literally nothing left of

1477.12 --> 1480.7199999999998
you and you don't even recognize

1478.88 --> 1484.3200000000002
yourself anymore

1480.72 --> 1487.84
how many people are already there

1484.32 --> 1487.84
think a fast amount of people

1487.919 --> 1491.6000000000001
think a whole fast amount of people are

1490.08 --> 1494.8799999999999
so badly corrupted

1491.6 --> 1495.76
into it that they spend a lot of their

1494.88 --> 1498.4
dream time

1495.76 --> 1500.24
just pretending like they haven't when

1498.4 --> 1502.64
they have

1500.24 --> 1503.52
so they just pretend like this ideal

1502.64 --> 1505.44
self

1503.52 --> 1507.039
image of themselves that they think they

1505.44 --> 1510.64
are while they are just

1507.039 --> 1514.08
full-on grabbled

1510.64 --> 1529.8400000000001
politicized demonic over the

1514.08 --> 1529.84
edge wrong

1532.4 --> 1537.039
okay so you can start water don't worry

1534.08 --> 1543.84
about it i i'm just being

1537.039 --> 1543.84
i'm just in a really shitty mood now

1546.32 --> 1551.4399999999998
and i'm not talking even about freaking

1549.039 --> 1557.84
globe heads

1551.44 --> 1561.1200000000001
it's just another consolidation prize

1557.84 --> 1564.08
oh look at these people that can't even

1561.12 --> 1566.1589999999999
that keep on holding on to the globe yay

1564.08 --> 1568.6399999999999
we're ahead of them

1566.159 --> 1569.2
and and yeah in the background scheme of

1568.64 --> 1572.88
things

1569.2 --> 1575.679
no it's just a stupid little distraction

1572.88 --> 1577.1200000000001
in the grand scheme of things because if

1575.679 --> 1585.6000000000001
it actually mattered

1577.12 --> 1588.7199999999998
more would have been done

1585.6 --> 1593.279
like actual measures but i think that

1588.72 --> 1595.44
just through programming through media

1593.279 --> 1598.64
the the right or the wrong type of

1595.44 --> 1599.8400000000001
people have just been collected riled up

1598.64 --> 1602.72
conditioned

1599.84 --> 1606.1589999999999
so that they choose to go after the flat

1602.72 --> 1606.159
earthers because it's painful

1607.039 --> 1611.279
nobody is ordering anything

1611.52 --> 1615.6
and that's why they're not really doing

1613.679 --> 1617.6000000000001
a lot against us

1615.6 --> 1619.6
because people are just willing to go

1617.6 --> 1623.4399999999998
against us themselves

1619.6 --> 1625.36
and it doesn't even have to be ordered

1623.44 --> 1628.0
flat earth is at this point don't even

1625.36 --> 1630.4799999999998
have to be declared enemies

1628.0 --> 1632.799
or like terrorists or anything it's just

1630.48 --> 1640.64
people will go at it naturally

1632.799 --> 1643.9189999999999
at this point

1640.64 --> 1655.8400000000001
or that at this point it it's been

1643.919 --> 1655.8400000000001
like that for a long time

1656.72 --> 1661.279
hello by the way geoshifter good to see

1841.279 --> 1847.6
didn't completely break your head with

1843.279 --> 1847.6

1848.88 --> 1851.8400000000001
man

1864.72 --> 1869.279
yeah that sucks dude damn

1870.24 --> 1875.6
like any idea why it happened like you

1872.72 --> 1879.039
like the last few days you were really

1875.6 --> 1880.7199999999998
like we had the call over skype

1879.039 --> 1882.72
and you seem to have like a lot of

1880.72 --> 1885.44
stress issues

1882.72 --> 1886.559
so i hope that hasn't caused you to get

1885.44 --> 1888.0800000000002
distracted

1886.559 --> 1889.84
in order for that to happen because

1888.08 --> 1890.799
that's typically how it happens with me

1889.84 --> 1893.279
when i get

1890.799 --> 1895.2
like really nervously stressed out about

1893.279 --> 1897.36
something

1895.2 --> 1898.96
then i get distracted like in traffic

1897.36 --> 1901.279
situations and that is when

1898.96 --> 1903.44
something could happen that's when it's

1901.279 --> 1906.0
gotten the closest with me to

1903.44 --> 1907.44
potentially get into an accident even

1906.0 --> 1907.76
though it's never happened and i have

1907.44 --> 1911.519
like

1907.76 --> 1914.0
last second reflexes just work

1911.519 --> 1914.0
thank god

1916.24 --> 1923.279
it was a bit like that was it

1920.159 --> 1923.6000000000001
two or three days ago right wait no was

1923.279 --> 1926.399
when

1923.6 --> 1928.559
with the rainbow with the big rainbow

1926.399 --> 1929.6789999999999
because it was very distracting and i

1928.559 --> 1932.8799999999999
almost like

1929.679 --> 1936.64
yeah drove straight into a car because i

1932.88 --> 1936.64
was staring at it at the wrong moment

1938.32 --> 1943.4399999999998
but yeah nothing happened thank god

1944.0 --> 1949.84
just went flying four meters jesus

1963.279 --> 1977.84
well dude i hope you get better soon

1990.15 --> 1993.3590000000002
[Music]

2011.2 --> 2019.8400000000001
okay your phone is bent

2014.559 --> 2019.84
and it still works huh

2044.84 --> 2047.84
uh

2065.2 --> 2075.839
hey matthew mitchell

2078.57 --> 2083.28
[Music]

2085.969 --> 2103.839
[Music]

2089.04 --> 2103.839
right wow that's certainly distracted

2108.72 --> 2112.0789999999997
great show yesterday you enjoyed it i'm

2110.64 --> 2114.16
glad you enjoyed it

2112.079 --> 2116.48
i tried to watch a part back of it but i

2114.16 --> 2119.04
never got far

2116.48 --> 2119.04
oh yeah

2119.839 --> 2123.92
man i just discovered yesterday that

2122.24 --> 2126.24
owen benjamin got

2123.92 --> 2127.52
well not totally banned but just like

2126.24 --> 2145.359
had a 30-day

2127.52 --> 2148.64
timeout from d-life what the [ __ ]

2145.359 --> 2148.64
have they said why

2151.92 --> 2158.7200000000003
i don't know exactly it it might be

2155.76 --> 2159.119
i don't know i really don't know why it

2158.72 --> 2162.3199999999997
could

2159.119 --> 2165.359
relate to like that he's his chat

2162.32 --> 2166.6400000000003
was informed before he was yeah it's not

2165.359 --> 2169.2
about that

2166.64 --> 2170.24
i think it could be because he said that

2169.2 --> 2173.2
like

2170.24 --> 2175.2
the woman in the situation like at the

2173.2 --> 2176.24
capitol starving and all that who got

2175.2 --> 2178.72
killed

2176.24 --> 2181.04
said that that is that he didn't get

2178.72 --> 2182.72
that she didn't get killed it was fake

2181.04 --> 2184.96
and getting very blatant about it and

2182.72 --> 2188.72
that might be

2184.96 --> 2190.96
a reason enough it's it's a typical type

2188.72 --> 2193.5989999999997
of excuse when you do that sort of thing

2190.96 --> 2195.28
you deny something it was real

2193.599 --> 2197.839
when somebody got killed that's when

2195.28 --> 2200.88
they typically like to take you down

2197.839 --> 2202.88
and he did that and i thought like okay

2200.88 --> 2205.04
well make a joke out of it but he like

2202.88 --> 2208.4
really said like no it's fake and

2205.04 --> 2212.0
she's like dude why do you

2208.4 --> 2215.119
really know no you don't i don't think

2212.0 --> 2217.44
any of us really really know

2215.119 --> 2219.119
unless somebody just spotted her just

2217.44 --> 2221.599
walking around somewhere else

2219.119 --> 2223.76
you know that sort of thing and i don't

2221.599 --> 2226.96
think anybody has

2223.76 --> 2228.48
so that would be i don't know i could

2226.96 --> 2231.599
imagine that that it could have been the

2228.48 --> 2231.599
reason that they did that

2232.8 --> 2239.52
or maybe it was just time to

2236.079 --> 2244.5600000000004
that release another demoralizing uh

2239.52 --> 2246.32
censorship wave and they just took him

2244.56 --> 2249.2
because they felt they could so it could

2246.32 --> 2257.839
be all kinds of reasons why exactly

2249.2 --> 2257.839
he got that 30-day timeout

2263.04 --> 2270.72
what my last 50 dollars

2266.16 --> 2274.72
gonna go down my sorrows now oh

2270.72 --> 2274.72
oh really that

2276.079 --> 2280.2400000000002
could you use it for something else yeah

2278.079 --> 2281.52
hello nathan oakley 1980 by the way and

2280.24 --> 2285.839
roger

2281.52 --> 2285.839
iron 26

2287.92 --> 2291.599
he should be back yeah well how is he

2289.76 --> 2299.8390000000004
going to do that

2291.599 --> 2299.839
like where is he going to stream now

2313.76 --> 2329.76
uh bus tickles right

2326.4 --> 2331.2000000000003
but yeah that that's not exactly right

2329.76 --> 2333.44
after it happened if you know what i

2331.2 --> 2333.4399999999996
mean

2334.48 --> 2338.32
look i think that for example people

2336.32 --> 2341.44
that would now start to

2338.32 --> 2346.079
theorize or just make a statement that

2341.44 --> 2348.64
for example john f kennedy

2346.079 --> 2350.2400000000002
isn't really dead they're not gonna get

2348.64 --> 2352.64
banned

2350.24 --> 2354.9599999999996
you know because it's so long ago they

2352.64 --> 2357.1189999999997
do this specifically only after it

2354.96 --> 2359.2
supposedly just happened and then when

2357.119 --> 2359.6800000000003
you say it's fake it's fake that's when

2359.2 --> 2361.359
they

2359.68 --> 2362.7999999999997
typically take you down that's something

2361.359 --> 2365.52
that i've noticed i don't know

2362.8 --> 2366.1600000000003
might be wrong might work differently

2365.52 --> 2370.72
but

2366.16 --> 2370.72
i've deduced that pattern at least

2371.599 --> 2375.92
and even with my own channel because

2373.839 --> 2377.52
some of my videos got removed and it was

2375.92 --> 2380.8
typically when i said

2377.52 --> 2383.839
this supposed murderous act might

2380.8 --> 2383.8390000000004
be fake

2384.32 --> 2388.56
some terrorist thing and because it was

2387.839 --> 2391.92
literally

2388.56 --> 2395.119
in the moment it just happened

2391.92 --> 2398.16
and that's when they start targeting you

2395.119 --> 2399.44
if you say it way later like months

2398.16 --> 2403.2799999999997
later

2399.44 --> 2403.28
they don't really seem to care that much

2408.72 --> 2414.16
yeah the ones that do the banning that

2410.88 --> 2414.1600000000003
is that order that

2419.92 --> 2423.6800000000003
right yeah i heard that too really work

2421.76 --> 2427.599
show roxanne

2423.68 --> 2427.5989999999997
and she did get on uh

2427.68 --> 2433.2
on mark sergeant's channel

2430.8 --> 2434.0
like i i listened to that before the

2433.2 --> 2437.52
show

2434.0 --> 2442.56
before this show part of it so roxanne

2437.52 --> 2446.88
really woke roxanne was on mark sergeant

2442.56 --> 2446.88
yeah with the mark sergeant and roxanne

2448.72 --> 2453.839
but yeah

2460.88 --> 2465.44
what exactly do you mean doing it on web

2463.68 --> 2469.5989999999997
page

2465.44 --> 2469.599
now what what do you mean work realist

2474.319 --> 2478.96
oh roger you just got in who got banned

2477.2 --> 2480.3999999999996
from what well owen benjamin got a

2478.96 --> 2483.44
30-day time

2480.4 --> 2485.839
timeout from d-life and

2483.44 --> 2488.44
really woke roxanne i also met her

2485.839 --> 2491.44
during the amsterdam conference in

2488.44 --> 2491.44
2019

2491.52 --> 2495.839
her channel got deleted apparently

2496.16 --> 2501.5989999999997
yeah d live okay because there is no

2499.44 --> 2505.04
platform out there

2501.599 --> 2508.88
that is not the little [ __ ] of big

2505.04 --> 2511.119
media there's none out of there

2508.88 --> 2512.56
like if some kind of alternative

2511.119 --> 2515.359
platform will have

2512.56 --> 2518.16
some success they will either be just

2515.359 --> 2521.68
cyber attack to death

2518.16 --> 2525.04
or they will be sued until they comply

2521.68 --> 2528.0789999999997
with whatever big tech wants

2525.04 --> 2531.92
because there is a technocracy they

2528.079 --> 2534.88
have full autocratic

2531.92 --> 2535.44
ownership of media they are the media

2534.88 --> 2538.0
guild

2535.44 --> 2538.8
they determine what is allowed in

2538.0 --> 2541.599
reality

2538.8 --> 2543.44
through their money and their pressure

2541.599 --> 2545.92
political pressure everything

2543.44 --> 2548.2400000000002
they determine and it doesn't matter if

2545.92 --> 2551.119
you start your own platform they will

2548.24 --> 2553.1189999999997
just get to that platform

2551.119 --> 2554.1600000000003
and break it down until the that

2553.119 --> 2557.52
platform either

2554.16 --> 2559.92
rejects the assailant the one opposing

2557.52 --> 2564.96
big tech

2559.92 --> 2567.599
or until it's destroyed

2564.96 --> 2567.599
and that's it

2569.44 --> 2574.16
because yeah you can start at some kind

2572.24 --> 2576.0789999999997
of media platform that's really cool

2574.16 --> 2579.839
yeah it is possible

2576.079 --> 2579.8390000000004
but they can still destroy it

2581.28 --> 2584.7200000000003
because they are a monopoly power these

2584.24 --> 2586.9599999999996
people

2584.72 --> 2588.0789999999997
are in control of a monopoly power

2586.96 --> 2591.2
system

2588.079 --> 2594.5600000000004
a media guild it's a guild

2591.2 --> 2598.48
it's guilt power conspired

2594.56 --> 2598.48
control a guild

2598.96 --> 2602.64
and they have full control over it yeah

2601.04 --> 2604.88
you can have your own

2602.64 --> 2606.16
little room little thing that you

2604.88 --> 2611.6800000000003
communicate with

2606.16 --> 2614.72
but if you're going to harbor assailants

2611.68 --> 2618.16
that are in the target area of

2614.72 --> 2620.9599999999996
big tech of the guild of media guild

2618.16 --> 2621.52
then they're just going to come after

2620.96 --> 2623.76
where

2621.52 --> 2625.04
the yeah the platform wherever that

2623.76 --> 2628.1600000000003
person's gonna harbor

2625.04 --> 2630.0
and destroy it or have them eject

2628.16 --> 2633.2799999999997
the assailant and that's just how it

2630.0 --> 2636.079
works there is no place you can hide

2633.28 --> 2636.079
not really

2639.599 --> 2644.2400000000002
because it's a guild and they've taken

2641.68 --> 2644.24
control

2646.4 --> 2652.7200000000003
they own media literally

2649.68 --> 2655.5989999999997
own it they determine

2652.72 --> 2655.5989999999997
what you're gonna do

2655.839 --> 2660.319
and you can either just follow their

2657.76 --> 2662.5600000000004
[ __ ] up demonic rules

2660.319 --> 2663.7599999999998
of lies and political correctness and

2662.56 --> 2667.839
just

2663.76 --> 2667.8390000000004
i don't know be the worst

2668.56 --> 2672.72
or you can not go along with it get

2671.599 --> 2675.119
ejected

2672.72 --> 2676.0
and then if you're going to try to get

2675.119 --> 2678.0
some alternative

2676.0 --> 2679.119
thing going then they're going to attack

2678.0 --> 2682.16
you

2679.119 --> 2686.1600000000003
instead instead of just kicking you out

2682.16 --> 2686.16
so that's what's what's going on right

2688.839 --> 2696.429
now

2691.78 --> 2696.429
[Music]

2713.119 --> 2716.1600000000003
good hackers would you not take ease no

2715.68 --> 2720.0
no no

2716.16 --> 2720.72
but the thing is like they're just gonna

2720.0 --> 2723.359
make

2720.72 --> 2724.56
things even worse like unless there is

2723.359 --> 2728.88
like a

2724.56 --> 2732.319
really big time united front

2728.88 --> 2735.2000000000003
level assault in some way virtual

2732.319 --> 2736.56
assault technicals or whatever however

2735.2 --> 2739.839
some kind of sabotage

2736.56 --> 2742.0789999999997
anything to really take it down who's

2739.839 --> 2746.319
gonna do that at this point

2742.079 --> 2749.76
everything everyone's already caught up

2746.319 --> 2751.92
in the web in being part

2749.76 --> 2754.5600000000004
of it in some way because there's

2751.92 --> 2757.6800000000003
nothing else left

2754.56 --> 2761.119
so who's gonna do all that

2757.68 --> 2762.72
you know maybe maybe 20 years ago

2761.119 --> 2764.4
something like that could have happened

2762.72 --> 2765.52
now i just don't see it happening

2764.4 --> 2769.92
anymore

2765.52 --> 2773.52
because they've won you understand

2769.92 --> 2775.359
they've won all this idea like oh

2773.52 --> 2778.16
they're so desperate now

2775.359 --> 2779.44
that it's because they've won and now

2778.16 --> 2782.319
they're just really nervous

2779.44 --> 2783.119
as they take the throne over all of us

2782.319 --> 2787.2799999999997
they're nervous

2783.119 --> 2790.6400000000003
because yeah typical emperor positions

2787.28 --> 2792.8
are very dangerous positions to be at

2790.64 --> 2794.319
because there's going to be other things

2792.8 --> 2797.52
that want to take those

2794.319 --> 2802.24
reigns over from you whoever you are

2797.52 --> 2805.28
there at the top

2802.24 --> 2808.3999999999996
but just from a public angle there's

2805.28 --> 2811.599
really nothing we can do about it

2808.4 --> 2815.44
they own us now they own the media

2811.599 --> 2818.1600000000003
that we use and we cannot

2815.44 --> 2820.64
do anything about it we don't have any

2818.16 --> 2820.64
rights

2822.64 --> 2826.319
that we can enforce there's nothing we

2824.88 --> 2828.4
can do

2826.319 --> 2831.839
they can just do whatever the [ __ ] they

2828.4 --> 2831.839
want with us

2832.079 --> 2835.28
and what are you gonna do gonna go on

2833.52 --> 2836.319
another platform well guess what that

2835.28 --> 2838.96
other platform

2836.319 --> 2840.72
is going to get the same thing it's all

2838.96 --> 2842.559
the same thing eventually it's all the

2840.72 --> 2845.5989999999997
same thing every alternative

2842.559 --> 2847.8390000000004
will turn exactly into the same thing

2845.599 --> 2849.76
that it originally started out escaping

2847.839 --> 2853.52
from everything

2849.76 --> 2853.5200000000004
everything you understand

2856.839 --> 2859.839
everything

2862.72 --> 2866.16
yeah isn't that cool vote with your

2864.88 --> 2869.28
dollar in your currency

2866.16 --> 2871.44
i used to remember that

2869.28 --> 2872.4
when it was like yeah yeah well if you

2871.44 --> 2876.559
can only in

2872.4 --> 2881.599
politics choose for two arms of the same

2876.559 --> 2883.44
body it's a false dichotomy choice

2881.599 --> 2886.1600000000003
and would you just void with your dollar

2883.44 --> 2888.64
well guess what

2886.16 --> 2890.48
it's become the same thing there is

2888.64 --> 2893.7599999999998
nothing left

2890.48 --> 2897.44
for you to choose

2893.76 --> 2897.44
you see it's lost

2899.44 --> 2904.8
who are you going to choose what the

2901.76 --> 2906.8
things that are going go away anyway

2904.8 --> 2908.6400000000003
that are not even responding to you

2906.8 --> 2911.52
wanting them to be there they're just

2908.64 --> 2911.52
going to go away

2912.48 --> 2917.04
no you don't have a choice it's over

2917.119 --> 2921.76
we are living in the new world order

2919.599 --> 2923.04
right now and there's nothing you can do

2921.76 --> 2926.88
to stop it anymore

2923.04 --> 2930.24
nothing left what what are you gonna do

2926.88 --> 2933.119
after all this yeah most people

2930.24 --> 2934.16
are just going to spend their time

2933.119 --> 2937.2000000000003
imagining

2934.16 --> 2938.72
how they're going to overcome it yeah

2937.2 --> 2942.0
that's what's going to happen right now

2938.72 --> 2944.16
a lot of people are just going to

2942.0 --> 2946.24
make giant stories over like how there

2944.16 --> 2948.16
is some kind of hope to overcome it and

2946.24 --> 2950.4799999999996
that's never going to end it's just

2948.16 --> 2952.96
endless amounts of false hope

2950.48 --> 2954.72
somehow secretly going to overcome it

2952.96 --> 2958.2400000000002
it's not going to happen

2954.72 --> 2958.8799999999997
it's not gonna happen 1984 is what's

2958.24 --> 2960.64
happening

2958.88 --> 2963.28
and it's gonna get worse it's gonna get

2960.64 --> 2966.24
worse than in the [ __ ] movie

2963.28 --> 2968.1600000000003
until it's a torturous hell beyond

2966.24 --> 2972.0
everyone's imagination

2968.16 --> 2976.3999999999996
and people are just going to just die

2972.0 --> 2976.4
one way or the other suicide or just

2977.68 --> 2983.2799999999997
whatever just crashing something

2981.599 --> 2985.119
who knows who they're gonna take with

2983.28 --> 2986.48
them because at some point everybody's

2985.119 --> 2988.559
just gonna be the enemy because

2986.48 --> 2989.44
everybody else also let it happen just

2988.559 --> 2992.8
like you

2989.44 --> 2995.76
so everything is the enemy in the end

2992.8 --> 2998.6400000000003
yeah it's all [ __ ] i'm really

2995.76 --> 3001.6800000000003
pessimistic right now

2998.64 --> 3005.44
and i don't like that i am like this

3001.68 --> 3005.44
and i don't want this message to

3005.599 --> 3008.559
to depress you

3008.72 --> 3012.24
it's just that i don't really see a

3010.8 --> 3015.8390000000004
[ __ ] way through it anymore

3012.24 --> 3018.0789999999997
and i i refuse to start up some

3015.839 --> 3018.88
stupid little illusion that there's some

3018.079 --> 3022.0
way through

3018.88 --> 3025.52
there is not the only way through

3022.0 --> 3026.0
is just having the ability to not let it

3025.52 --> 3028.88
phase you

3026.0 --> 3030.559
in any way and don't let it in if that

3028.88 --> 3033.28
is even possible it's like

3030.559 --> 3034.8
it's just a calculated risk like how far

3033.28 --> 3038.88
can you come without

3034.8 --> 3041.28
before you inevitably absolutely corrupt

3038.88 --> 3042.559
and died or whatever or just lose

3041.28 --> 3055.8390000000004
whatever you are

3042.559 --> 3055.8390000000004
how far can you carry it through

3058.74 --> 3062.66
[Music]

3066.88 --> 3070.7200000000003
now see all the sunlight behind me so

3069.28 --> 3083.76
very nice

3070.72 --> 3085.839
very very nice

3083.76 --> 3088.4
you know that i also felt like this 20

3085.839 --> 3088.4
years ago

3090.0 --> 3095.599
not exactly the same experience but then

3093.599 --> 3097.119
eventually i kind of calmed down and

3095.599 --> 3099.44
some kind of stupid

3097.119 --> 3101.04
idea that there was some way through

3099.44 --> 3103.28
caught me again

3101.04 --> 3105.119
and that's really when i when i'm yeah

3103.28 --> 3108.7200000000003
learn about alex jones

3105.119 --> 3110.7200000000003
alex jones was for me the first escape

3108.72 --> 3112.5589999999997
idea that there was some kind of way

3110.72 --> 3115.9199999999996
through it

3112.559 --> 3117.2000000000003
it's not and there will be new people

3115.92 --> 3120.64
and new things

3117.2 --> 3121.2799999999997
that'll suggest that some new angle to

3120.64 --> 3124.319
it

3121.28 --> 3127.92
it's all [ __ ] all of it

3124.319 --> 3127.92
there is no way through

3128.96 --> 3132.8
because the only thing that can stop it

3131.04 --> 3134.72
cannot happen

3132.8 --> 3136.6400000000003
because everything is in the counter

3134.72 --> 3138.0
opposite position for that to happen so

3136.64 --> 3141.1189999999997
there is no way through it's

3138.0 --> 3142.88
a death spiral it's a death spiral and

3141.119 --> 3145.2000000000003
nobody can

3142.88 --> 3146.319
even maneuver themselves anymore in

3145.2 --> 3149.5989999999997
order to prevent it

3146.319 --> 3152.4
it's just all going to die everything

3149.599 --> 3153.2000000000003
everyone every beautiful thing that

3152.4 --> 3155.839
you've known

3153.2 --> 3155.839
everything

3158.48 --> 3162.559
so i'm just trying to now

3162.64 --> 3168.5589999999997
learn how i can accept it

3166.16 --> 3169.68
and survive through it for as long as i

3168.559 --> 3172.96
can

3169.68 --> 3176.24
because not

3172.96 --> 3179.28
refusing to allow it to happen

3176.24 --> 3182.7999999999997
is not yielding anything

3179.28 --> 3184.88
productive to me it's just wasting my

3182.8 --> 3187.04
energy just keeping me stuck and i don't

3184.88 --> 3187.359
want to do it anymore i don't want to

3187.04 --> 3189.7599999999998
have

3187.359 --> 3190.96
[ __ ] false hope anymore i don't want

3189.76 --> 3194.559
it

3190.96 --> 3198.079
i'm done with this [ __ ] [ __ ] world

3194.559 --> 3201.599
and these disgusting people that are

3198.079 --> 3203.2000000000003
nothing nothing but power only

3201.599 --> 3205.119
power it's the only thing they are

3203.2 --> 3208.3999999999996
they're not even human anymore

3205.119 --> 3209.92
it's just how to stay on top of that big

3208.4 --> 3213.04
tension field

3209.92 --> 3216.079
that is there to absolutely feed

3213.04 --> 3218.4
disintegrate destroy and erase

3216.079 --> 3220.079
everything and that's the only [ __ ]

3218.4 --> 3223.6800000000003
thing these people care of

3220.079 --> 3226.1600000000003
is only power nothing else

3223.68 --> 3228.319
nothing else and nothing can stop it

3226.16 --> 3230.7999999999997
there is nothing to stop it

3228.319 --> 3231.839
it's not gonna stop until everything is

3230.8 --> 3236.0
destroyed

3231.839 --> 3238.64
and it's gonna take

3236.0 --> 3241.04
oh it's not gonna be quick because that

3238.64 --> 3244.4
wouldn't be torturous enough

3241.04 --> 3247.2
but it's going to be quick enough that

3244.4 --> 3248.0
everybody can never forget that it's

3247.2 --> 3250.16
going on

3248.0 --> 3252.64
so it will be quick enough so that it

3250.16 --> 3254.5589999999997
cannot be escaped from mentally for

3252.64 --> 3256.319
people that they will forever be

3254.559 --> 3258.559
confronted

3256.319 --> 3259.92
that they can never escape that the

3258.559 --> 3262.48
world and humanity

3259.92 --> 3263.28
is in a downworld death spiral that they

3262.48 --> 3265.839
can never

3263.28 --> 3265.8390000000004
escape from

3273.55 --> 3284.1600000000003
[Music]

3281.28 --> 3285.8
because who who's gonna defy it look

3284.16 --> 3288.979
what what the [ __ ] are you gonna do

3285.8 --> 3288.9790000000003
[Music]

3289.119 --> 3295.2000000000003
nobody's gonna stop it they might stop

3292.559 --> 3296.88
their local situation and rise up and

3295.2 --> 3298.72
then oppose it and then they have to

3296.88 --> 3300.48
defend that the rest of their lives and

3298.72 --> 3302.9599999999996
go through all the hell

3300.48 --> 3304.319
just to have a little place that's kind

3302.96 --> 3307.92
of countering it

3304.319 --> 3310.24
right hell for the rest of their lives

3307.92 --> 3310.96
just as for a little opposition look at

3310.24 --> 3314.16
all the

3310.96 --> 3316.799
massive sacrifices they would have to do

3314.16 --> 3319.68
just to do that and that's it because

3316.799 --> 3322.64
they're not going to stop the system

3319.68 --> 3324.16
nobody is going to stop the system do

3322.64 --> 3327.44
you understand

3324.16 --> 3330.799
nobody not an organization not an

3327.44 --> 3332.319
individual nothing nobody is going to

3330.799 --> 3334.799
stop the system

3332.319 --> 3337.04
they're not doing it nobody's doing it

3334.799 --> 3339.92
nobody is going to do it

3337.04 --> 3342.16
yet there is so much need for it so much

3339.92 --> 3342.88
longing for something or somebody to

3342.16 --> 3345.1189999999997
rise up

3342.88 --> 3346.2400000000002
to stop the system that there is a big

3345.119 --> 3349.52
market

3346.24 --> 3352.319
a big market for people

3349.52 --> 3354.24
that want that so that there's plenty of

3352.319 --> 3355.119
people that will give you that false

3354.24 --> 3357.5989999999997
hope

3355.119 --> 3359.44
feed off your desperate need for

3357.599 --> 3361.28
something to stop it

3359.44 --> 3363.359
for something to stop the torture and

3361.28 --> 3365.6800000000003
you will be very motivated to keep

3363.359 --> 3367.68
feeding those people that'll just give

3365.68 --> 3369.359
you that little bit of illusion that

3367.68 --> 3371.5989999999997
something is going to stop it

3369.359 --> 3373.5989999999997
until it breaks up and it doesn't work

3371.599 --> 3374.1600000000003
anymore and then the next thing will pop

3373.599 --> 3377.3590000000004
up

3374.16 --> 3380.319
yeah forever it's never

3377.359 --> 3382.16
going to end do you understand never

3380.319 --> 3386.48
nobody is stopping it

3382.16 --> 3389.359
nothing is stopping it nobody can

3386.48 --> 3390.72
it's all illusion [ __ ] feeding off

3389.359 --> 3394.5589999999997
the desperation

3390.72 --> 3396.3999999999996
of the permanently dying enslaved

3394.559 --> 3398.88
that's what it is that's what's left

3396.4 --> 3401.52
right now do you understand

3398.88 --> 3403.28
that's the only thing there is nothing

3401.52 --> 3406.0
is going to stop it

3403.28 --> 3407.3590000000004
it's getting worse and worse and worse

3406.0 --> 3409.599
yeah well guess what that

3407.359 --> 3411.44
getting worse cycle unfortunately is not

3409.599 --> 3412.6400000000003
going to lead to these people totally

3411.44 --> 3413.28
getting out of control killing

3412.64 --> 3416.72
themselves

3413.28 --> 3419.2000000000003
now they're not doing that no they just

3416.72 --> 3420.64
up the pressure more for everybody else

3419.2 --> 3423.68
it's even the reason why they're

3420.64 --> 3426.48
revealing themselves for [ __ ] demons

3423.68 --> 3428.24
for actual demonic behavior it's why

3426.48 --> 3431.28
they like to flounder it

3428.24 --> 3433.52
because it ups the pressure with people

3431.28 --> 3435.2000000000003
it makes them more desperate so then

3433.52 --> 3438.079
they through other channels

3435.2 --> 3440.0
can attain more control through their

3438.079 --> 3442.079
desperation

3440.0 --> 3444.079
by giving them false hope that they

3442.079 --> 3446.799
somehow are going to be stopped

3444.079 --> 3448.0
they are not nothing nobody is going to

3446.799 --> 3451.28
stop it

3448.0 --> 3453.92
nobody yeah

3451.28 --> 3455.52
so come in christians tell me how christ

3453.92 --> 3458.7200000000003
is going to come and stop it

3455.52 --> 3461.2
yeah and how many hundreds of years what

3458.72 --> 3463.359
will be left of humanity

3461.2 --> 3465.2799999999997
by the time christ is gonna come and

3463.359 --> 3467.68
stop it

3465.28 --> 3470.799
whatever's left of humanity won't even

3467.68 --> 3473.04
remember what it is to be human

3470.799 --> 3474.319
in order to give off some kind of

3473.04 --> 3476.5589999999997
example like any

3474.319 --> 3478.24
children whatever is even going to be

3476.559 --> 3481.92
possible if there's even going to be

3478.24 --> 3483.7599999999998
fertility left or from some laboratory

3481.92 --> 3485.76
where it's stored or whatever

3483.76 --> 3487.3590000000004
they're going to have to figure it all

3485.76 --> 3489.76
out from scratch because

3487.359 --> 3490.64
everything that humanity is everything

3489.76 --> 3493.3590000000004
we obtained

3490.64 --> 3493.7599999999998
is all being eroded erased until there

3493.359 --> 3499.2799999999997
is

3493.76 --> 3499.28
nothing left but corporate shell slaves

3500.24 --> 3503.68
isn't going to be no culture left

3502.24 --> 3507.68
nothing nothing but

3503.68 --> 3507.68
pure hell slavery

3508.799 --> 3513.599
so yeah christ how long is that gonna

3510.88 --> 3514.799
take for you to supposedly come back and

3513.599 --> 3517.92
stop this

3514.799 --> 3520.319
right i don't think it is

3517.92 --> 3521.119
oh should be yeah the bible says it

3520.319 --> 3523.839
would

3521.119 --> 3524.88
that's really cute well is it even going

3523.839 --> 3527.2799999999997
to be worth it

3524.88 --> 3530.559
or is he just christ just going to

3527.28 --> 3534.079
arrive to a giant hell pit

3530.559 --> 3537.8390000000004
who's gonna even want him to save him

3534.079 --> 3541.3590000000004
and save them at that point when every

3537.839 --> 3544.319
hope they've ever known was false hope

3541.359 --> 3544.88
just to make them kill themselves who is

3544.319 --> 3547.839
going to

3544.88 --> 3548.88
even accept christ as a savior when he

3547.839 --> 3551.839
comes back

3548.88 --> 3553.2000000000003
when every hope these individuals in

3551.839 --> 3555.599
that time

3553.2 --> 3557.4399999999996
who have known will have been false hope

3555.599 --> 3560.559
just to destroy them

3557.44 --> 3563.599
who's then going to embrace christ even

3560.559 --> 3563.599
if they believed him

3563.68 --> 3570.3999999999996
right see how that works see how

3567.04 --> 3575.44
[ __ ] i feel right now what real

3570.4 --> 3575.44
[ __ ] pessimism is like yeah

3581.839 --> 3587.839
no dark is before the dawn yeah yeah

3584.839 --> 3587.839
yeah

3588.88 --> 3592.559
do i have faith in anything

3594.319 --> 3597.2
what does that mean

3598.88 --> 3602.319
faith that things are gonna be all right

3601.44 --> 3605.2000000000003
no

3602.319 --> 3605.7599999999998
no i don't but i'll bet that at some

3605.2 --> 3608.8799999999997
point

3605.76 --> 3611.599
the story will be turned around

3608.88 --> 3613.359
right because media just does that [ __ ]

3611.599 --> 3615.76
they'll just make it go away

3613.359 --> 3616.4
because the obstacle why they brought it

3615.76 --> 3619.599
forth

3616.4 --> 3621.6800000000003
has been removed like any

3619.599 --> 3622.6400000000003
potential thing that could have ever

3621.68 --> 3626.3999999999996
changed

3622.64 --> 3630.0789999999997
all of it has been surgically removed

3626.4 --> 3631.76
so now it's okay again now people can be

3630.079 --> 3633.119
brought back to the false hope again

3631.76 --> 3634.7990000000004
that everything is all right which is

3633.119 --> 3637.92
what the media does

3634.799 --> 3640.16
every single time they absolutely

3637.92 --> 3641.92
annihilated some kind of opposition

3640.16 --> 3643.2
then everything then everybody gets a

3641.92 --> 3645.04
relief

3643.2 --> 3646.72
because that's how it is they punish

3645.04 --> 3649.7599999999998
everyone

3646.72 --> 3651.68
if one figure rises up

3649.76 --> 3653.0400000000004
then they punish everyone that's what

3651.68 --> 3656.48
they do because they are

3653.04 --> 3659.92
merciless demons and they're

3656.48 --> 3663.52
hell-bound literally hell-bound

3659.92 --> 3668.16
by this system of absolute uniform

3663.52 --> 3671.839
peer pressure demonic mind control

3668.16 --> 3671.839
that's what they do

3679.33 --> 3682.699
[Music]

3685.76 --> 3689.599
well what grill is the [ __ ] thing is it

3688.079 --> 3692.88
was always that

3689.599 --> 3692.88
it was always hell

3694.16 --> 3698.0
it's just that we have this weird little

3697.52 --> 3701.2
thing in

3698.0 --> 3701.2
us called hope

3702.559 --> 3708.1600000000003
and that hope is very easy to attain

3708.72 --> 3715.1189999999997
as long as we don't know how [ __ ]

3711.839 --> 3715.119
reality really is

3716.88 --> 3719.28
you see

3721.119 --> 3726.559
and the people that are in control are

3723.2 --> 3729.9199999999996
that [ __ ] but they're all

3726.559 --> 3732.559
they're bred to endure torture

3729.92 --> 3733.599
you understand they are bred

3732.559 --> 3737.6800000000003
specifically

3733.599 --> 3740.079
to endure torture in order to hold out

3737.68 --> 3741.5989999999997
in that torturous position where they

3740.079 --> 3745.6800000000003
torture everybody else

3741.599 --> 3748.96
that's what they've been bred for

3745.68 --> 3751.5989999999997
that ability to endure torture in order

3748.96 --> 3755.119
to sustain torture on others

3751.599 --> 3757.839
you understand that's the hellscape

3755.119 --> 3759.44
that's the cause of the hellscape and

3757.839 --> 3761.359
that's why i've said long ago

3759.44 --> 3764.079
it's impossible it's an impossible

3761.359 --> 3766.319
mission and it's not even a

3764.079 --> 3768.6400000000003
seeming it is an impossible it can never

3766.319 --> 3772.319
happen i don't see it happening

3768.64 --> 3775.359
the only way i can stop it is just

3772.319 --> 3776.72
annihilate all of them these people

3775.359 --> 3779.44
these controllers just

3776.72 --> 3781.359
remove the system break the system just

3779.44 --> 3784.799
absolutely surgically remove

3781.359 --> 3786.799
everything but as soon as you do that

3784.799 --> 3788.16
they're just going to blow up the world

3786.799 --> 3791.0389999999998
just like that

3788.16 --> 3794.3999999999996
because they know that that is the only

3791.039 --> 3794.4
way that is going to stop it

3794.96 --> 3798.2400000000002
and that's why they've done it's all

3797.28 --> 3801.6800000000003
maximum

3798.24 --> 3802.319
power nothing else it's only power you

3801.68 --> 3806.24
understand

3802.319 --> 3808.079
only power in every form

3806.24 --> 3809.4399999999996
that drives these people and they don't

3808.079 --> 3812.48
give about anything

3809.44 --> 3814.16
anything they don't care whether the

3812.48 --> 3817.52
entire world

3814.16 --> 3821.0389999999998
dies instantly or whether it has

3817.52 --> 3824.88
a like an internally slow torture cycle

3821.039 --> 3828.1600000000003
they don't care they don't care

3824.88 --> 3831.28
not really only power

3828.16 --> 3834.0
and the only way to stop this [ __ ] is by

3831.28 --> 3836.1600000000003
surgically removing all of that all of

3834.0 --> 3836.16
it

3836.319 --> 3839.68
and the end the secret organization but

3838.96 --> 3843.839
that's

3839.68 --> 3847.2799999999997
like a world altering re-arranging thing

3843.839 --> 3848.5589999999997
and the only groups that have ever been

3847.28 --> 3850.96
able to do

3848.559 --> 3852.1600000000003
that sort of thing on a vast skill in

3850.96 --> 3856.0
which it is required

3852.16 --> 3856.0
are the ones in control

3862.559 --> 3881.8390000000004
and nobody can ever rise up to that

3865.52 --> 3881.839
power again

3917.28 --> 3925.2000000000003
right so they're just there forever

3922.079 --> 3927.039
that's it they're all there

3925.2 --> 3929.2799999999997
it's gonna keep on going nothing's gonna

3927.039 --> 3931.039
stop it because these people are not

3929.28 --> 3933.599
going to remove themselves

3931.039 --> 3936.96
they're not gonna step away they're

3933.599 --> 3940.0
gonna do it i don't see them do it

3936.96 --> 3940.0
i want them to

3943.039 --> 3946.1600000000003
they're not going to do it

3949.039 --> 3952.88
because they have been bred to live a

3951.92 --> 3956.16
slow

3952.88 --> 3959.359
torturous life

3956.16 --> 3961.2799999999997
and that's it makes them want it they

3959.359 --> 3965.839
want all of it they would just want it

3961.28 --> 3965.8390000000004
they don't care

3970.61 --> 3973.86
[Music]

4010.319 --> 4017.839
yeah matthew mitchell

4013.839 --> 4019.92
that's well that's basic advice

4017.839 --> 4022.64
don't take those tickets don't take the

4019.92 --> 4026.16
loans and don't mask up and all that

4022.64 --> 4026.96
yeah but you know that's still assuming

4026.16 --> 4029.68
that

4026.96 --> 4030.16
we have a choice that we have rights

4029.68 --> 4034.0
when

4030.16 --> 4036.0789999999997
it's only just make-believe

4034.0 --> 4037.28
we don't do what they say they're just

4036.079 --> 4040.96
going to make

4037.28 --> 4043.3590000000004
us do something else instead there's no

4040.96 --> 4044.88
turning back it will not go away again

4043.359 --> 4046.0
it's only going to get worse do you

4044.88 --> 4049.039
understand

4046.0 --> 4050.64
there's no other direction that's going

4049.039 --> 4053.8390000000004
to be taken

4050.64 --> 4056.72
it's only going to get worse

4053.839 --> 4058.24
so it in the grand scape of things yeah

4056.72 --> 4060.0789999999997
you're sure you can

4058.24 --> 4061.4399999999996
make certain decisions about how to deal

4060.079 --> 4063.039
with the situation

4061.44 --> 4066.2400000000002
and then everything changes and it's

4063.039 --> 4068.48
completely irrelevant

4066.24 --> 4070.24
and you're just going to face a next

4068.48 --> 4073.28
level of corrupting

4070.24 --> 4075.4399999999996
confronting situations and then watch as

4073.28 --> 4078.7200000000003
a whole bunch of people are going to

4075.44 --> 4080.88
take it again and then

4078.72 --> 4083.0389999999998
you resist that and then it's going to

4080.88 --> 4084.0
stop and then some other situation again

4083.039 --> 4087.44
and then more

4084.0 --> 4090.799
and then more it's never going to

4087.44 --> 4094.0
stop ever you understand never

4090.799 --> 4096.64
going to stop it's going to go

4094.0 --> 4097.44
the rest of your life for however long

4096.64 --> 4105.839
that is

4097.44 --> 4105.839
it's never going to stop

4108.08 --> 4111.6
it's never ending torture

4112.719 --> 4118.88
and there is no purpose to it it's just

4116.319 --> 4121.1990000000005
a power system that is completely stuck

4118.88 --> 4124.2390000000005
and rigid

4121.199 --> 4125.5199999999995
and super dynamic in its application of

4124.239 --> 4128.3189999999995
control

4125.52 --> 4129.4400000000005
but the structure itself is absolutely

4128.319 --> 4133.759
rigid and

4129.44 --> 4136.96
just unchangeable

4133.759 --> 4136.96
and it's not going to stop

4145.279 --> 4148.400000000001
if if there was something that could be

4147.92 --> 4152.2390000000005
done

4148.4 --> 4154.639999999999
somehow to stop it i would think of it

4152.239 --> 4154.639999999999
i hope

4155.759 --> 4163.679
but yeah unless it's just

4159.52 --> 4165.120000000001
full-blown suicide bomber level and just

4163.679 --> 4168.2390000000005
like okay

4165.12 --> 4170.159
everybody just keep

4168.239 --> 4171.678999999999
running and just as soon as you get to

4170.159 --> 4173.2789999999995
them just blow it up it just doesn't

4171.679 --> 4174.64
matter anymore because we're all dead

4173.279 --> 4177.279
anyway

4174.64 --> 4178.319
when is that gonna happen right no it's

4177.279 --> 4181.4400000000005
never gonna happen

4178.319 --> 4185.679
no never gonna happen nothing

4181.44 --> 4185.678999999999
will ever change it nothing

4186.96 --> 4203.84
it's not gonna stop ever

4225.52 --> 4232.56
so was was does breath

4229.36 --> 4234.88
death bring them well

4232.56 --> 4234.88
end

4242.0 --> 4245.6
or reincarnation and then you're gonna

4243.76 --> 4247.6
go back in the same [ __ ]

4245.6 --> 4248.88
or from some other angle and then you

4247.6 --> 4251.76
will

4248.88 --> 4253.12
re-experience hope all over again and

4251.76 --> 4255.360000000001
you will believe it

4253.12 --> 4257.199
and then it's all the shits over and

4255.36 --> 4260.719
over again yeah yeah yeah

4257.199 --> 4264.159
yeah it's never gonna stop

4260.719 --> 4266.719
but it's okay because through

4264.159 --> 4269.28
reincarnation if you believe that then

4266.719 --> 4269.28
you can

4269.44 --> 4273.759999999999
well it's like this you whenever you die

4272.08 --> 4275.28
if you believe in reincarnation you take

4273.76 --> 4279.679
the blue pill again

4275.28 --> 4282.32
every time so yeah

4279.679 --> 4284.0
it's really it makes me dirty even

4282.32 --> 4284.639999999999
letting it roll out of my mind but yeah

4284.0 --> 4288.48
there's

4284.64 --> 4291.679
hope in death yeah yeah

4288.48 --> 4295.12
see it see eternal torture

4291.679 --> 4298.84
this is hell we are in hell

4295.12 --> 4301.84
the mechanism is all there it's all

4298.84 --> 4301.84
[ __ ]

4314.9 --> 4325.169
[Music]

4336.239 --> 4342.159
yeah what am i gonna do about it

4340.0 --> 4343.44
well there's only one thing i can do

4342.159 --> 4346.719
about it

4343.44 --> 4348.32
i wish i could have done it a long time

4346.719 --> 4350.96
ago

4348.32 --> 4351.44
but yeah it's an integral part of my

4350.96 --> 4354.88
being

4351.44 --> 4357.678999999999
and the learning curves therein

4354.88 --> 4358.8
and that is i have to stop caring i have

4357.679 --> 4362.159
to somehow

4358.8 --> 4363.52
have sensitivity and have to learn to

4362.159 --> 4366.799999999999
not care anymore

4363.52 --> 4367.84
like literally not care like yes i am in

4366.8 --> 4371.12
hell

4367.84 --> 4372.159000000001
like un unspeakable undescribable

4371.12 --> 4375.04
torture

4372.159 --> 4375.759999999999
on many levels in the small in the big

4375.04 --> 4379.44
slow

4375.76 --> 4380.719
quick is all around me and i have to

4379.44 --> 4384.159
just

4380.719 --> 4386.4
not care because i well right now it's

4384.159 --> 4388.639999999999
very hard to unsee

4386.4 --> 4391.04
and in a way i don't want to unsee i

4388.64 --> 4394.719
don't want to

4391.04 --> 4396.08
fall back into the same mistake again

4394.719 --> 4398.2390000000005
then i'm going to have some kind of

4396.08 --> 4400.239
false hope for the world

4398.239 --> 4402.639999999999
because it is all [ __ ] and i'm just

4400.239 --> 4404.718999999999
seeing it as it is right now

4402.64 --> 4407.12
and i look at that many times and then i

4404.719 --> 4409.28
hold on to some stupid little thing that

4407.12 --> 4412.5599999999995
suggests that it's going to be all over

4409.28 --> 4416.4
finally all this all that no

4412.56 --> 4420.400000000001
i'm done with it i'm done with [ __ ]

4416.4 --> 4422.239
hope concerning the [ __ ] world

4420.4 --> 4424.159
and the only way that i can see through

4422.239 --> 4427.12
it is to literally just

4424.159 --> 4427.679
not care anymore like doesn't mean that

4427.12 --> 4431.92
i can't

4427.679 --> 4431.92
try to help you know

4432.8 --> 4437.04
because if everybody's just completely

4435.04 --> 4439.28
demoralized

4437.04 --> 4441.0
then you don't have anything it's not

4439.28 --> 4444.5599999999995
that's not helping

4441.0 --> 4444.56
demoralization doesn't help

4448.8 --> 4455.84
yeah look look who's talking here

4451.92 --> 4455.84
i dude

4462.48 --> 4466.639999999999
but maybe if i just stop caring then it

4465.6 --> 4471.04
wouldn't be

4466.64 --> 4471.04
pulling at me so much

4471.44 --> 4475.759999999999
i could maybe just get on with my life

4478.56 --> 4484.400000000001
have more room in my life for actually

4482.48 --> 4486.639999999999
doing something that i know is

4484.4 --> 4488.96
constructive

4486.64 --> 4490.8
like even trying those things would be

4488.96 --> 4492.4800000000005
constructive even if it doesn't lead to

4490.8 --> 4494.88
anything

4492.48 --> 4496.159
so i have to stop caring like really

4494.88 --> 4499.4400000000005
like cremation

4496.159 --> 4500.879999999999
of care level yeah yeah i know trigger

4499.44 --> 4503.36
trigger trick or trick or trigger

4500.88 --> 4504.0
yeah like really stop caring because

4503.36 --> 4506.799999999999
it's all

4504.0 --> 4507.199
[ __ ] and nothing is gonna stop it so

4506.8 --> 4510.400000000001
it's

4507.199 --> 4513.36
just torture it's just torture

4510.4 --> 4514.639999999999
i don't want to care anymore it's just

4513.36 --> 4517.44

like is this useful is it useful just

5885.119 --> 5889.44
for expression of what i'm really

5887.04 --> 5889.44
feeling

5891.52 --> 5897.679
maybe just because of that i don't know

5895.76 --> 5900.08
it just feel really [ __ ] at this

5897.679 --> 5900.08
moment

5901.679 --> 5907.6
also yeah weird

5904.96 --> 5909.28
apparently good like the guy that's been

5907.6 --> 5912.8
sending me super chats

5909.28 --> 5916.239
that's good servant like

5912.8 --> 5917.360000000001
paypal so not used to like drop nickels

5916.239 --> 5919.44
in the chat

5917.36 --> 5922.88
but now he's sending me paypal it's

5919.44 --> 5922.879999999999
really kind of weirding me out

5923.6 --> 5928.56
like dude why are you doing that you're

5926.08 --> 5928.5599999999995
banned

5930.0 --> 5939.84
like why are you doing that it's just

5932.48 --> 5939.839999999999
weirding me out

5942.239 --> 5946.08
i'm real not phony okay well thanks

5945.199 --> 5949.199
dimitrov i

5946.08 --> 5950.0
appreciate that i just i feel so [ __ ]

5949.199 --> 5953.839999999999
miserable

5950.0 --> 5953.84
right now

5957.6 --> 5962.88
and it's getting really weird inside my

5959.76 --> 5962.88
head too because

5962.96 --> 5967.44
i want to get out of it i even feel

5965.6 --> 5970.96
opportunities to get out of it

5967.44 --> 5971.44
but i don't want it to be that way

5970.96 --> 5975.28
because

5971.44 --> 5980.4
it would just be conjuring up naivety

5975.28 --> 5983.199
forgetting and letting the natural hope

5980.4 --> 5984.5599999999995
baseless hope spring up once again

5983.199 --> 5987.04
because it works with me

5984.56 --> 5987.679
remember it's like when things get too

5987.04 --> 5990.88
shitty

5987.679 --> 5994.08
amnesia sets in and then it just

5990.88 --> 5997.52
happens all over again in a new cycle

5994.08 --> 5999.679
and i'm sick of it i'm sick

5997.52 --> 6000.639
of that process i don't want it to

5999.679 --> 6004.8
happen like that

6000.639 --> 6008.719
i don't want my system

6004.8 --> 6009.6
to just fool me again just so that i can

6008.719 --> 6012.719
get

6009.6 --> 6016.159000000001
survive through this i

6012.719 --> 6019.36
i don't want this anymore

6016.159 --> 6021.759999999999
i don't want the freaking hope

6019.36 --> 6024.4
i don't want false hope i don't want

6021.76 --> 6024.400000000001
[ __ ]

6027.36 --> 6034.88
i want to just be able to survive

6030.4 --> 6037.759999999999
without it and then

6034.88 --> 6040.08
find the real energy in the real things

6037.76 --> 6051.84
i don't want any more false hope

6040.08 --> 6051.84
i don't want anymore

6063.199 --> 6079.839999999999
all right see you later iron 26.

6081.28 --> 6087.119
perfect utopia there is no such thing

6084.48 --> 6088.4
it's exactly the opposite dutch sailor

6087.119 --> 6091.599999999999
it's exactly

6088.4 --> 6093.44
the opposite there is no perfect utopia

6091.6 --> 6095.92
that doesn't exist it's a really

6093.44 --> 6097.678999999999
superficial dumb concept

6095.92 --> 6099.52
that only naive people could ever

6097.679 --> 6102.4800000000005
believe become real

6099.52 --> 6104.2390000000005
because it can't but it can be the exact

6102.48 --> 6104.879999999999
opposite though and that's kind of where

6104.239 --> 6107.678999999999
we're at

6104.88 --> 6110.32
that's where it's going it's not going

6107.679 --> 6114.08
into any kind of utopic direction it's

6110.32 --> 6114.08
only going to hell

6119.04 --> 6124.32
could serve in his band you didn't know

6120.88 --> 6124.32
that that's months ago

6128.239 --> 6134.32
yeah he got all weird

6131.28 --> 6136.8
and he basically like yeah

6134.32 --> 6138.08
betrayed my trust and our friendship

6136.8 --> 6141.1990000000005
over a skype

6138.08 --> 6142.0
recorded me in very vulnerable moments

6141.199 --> 6146.08
without even

6142.0 --> 6146.08
saying that he was recording it

6146.88 --> 6153.36
and then i don't know apparently though

6151.04 --> 6155.199
he has not shared it with anyone and

6153.36 --> 6157.759999999999
apparently somebody else has

6155.199 --> 6159.36
fooled me tricked me into believing that

6157.76 --> 6161.4400000000005
that happened

6159.36 --> 6163.28
so that was weird and i really flipped

6161.44 --> 6165.839999999999
out on him over it

6163.28 --> 6166.96
but apparently he didn't do that but he

6165.84 --> 6170.8
was getting

6166.96 --> 6173.199
really weird like really

6170.8 --> 6175.28
psychotically weird with it and thought

6173.199 --> 6178.799999999999
that he was on some kind of a weird

6175.28 --> 6182.08
christ secret mission [ __ ]

6178.8 --> 6185.119000000001
like his own kind of little cue

6182.08 --> 6187.28
inward spiral [ __ ] really weird so he

6185.119 --> 6190.799999999999
went on the tony starner show

6187.28 --> 6194.88
complete savage scumbag

6190.8 --> 6197.4400000000005
and yeah try to go

6194.88 --> 6198.08
after evil people it's just another q

6197.44 --> 6201.5199999999995
scam

6198.08 --> 6204.48
[ __ ] right because

6201.52 --> 6206.159000000001
nothing is going to take the miserable

6204.48 --> 6208.159
[ __ ] psychopaths

6206.159 --> 6210.239
that have their power positions out of

6208.159 --> 6211.36
it nothing is going to do that people

6210.239 --> 6214.718999999999
are just going to

6211.36 --> 6216.839999999999
know it and allow it to happen

6214.719 --> 6218.56
because that's how the [ __ ] world

6216.84 --> 6221.92
works

6218.56 --> 6225.1990000000005
the biggest turrets go to the top

6221.92 --> 6228.96
and nobody's going to stop it except

6225.199 --> 6232.879999999999
other big turds yeah

6228.96 --> 6234.96
it's a big game you're the subject

6232.88 --> 6237.28
in the game and there's nothing you

6234.96 --> 6240.2390000000005
could [ __ ] do about it

6237.28 --> 6242.88
but there's plenty of market for hope

6240.239 --> 6244.799999999999
plenty of market for hope all the slaves

6242.88 --> 6247.1990000000005
need a good hope story

6244.8 --> 6248.08
to get around in their [ __ ] slave

6247.199 --> 6250.638999999999
life

6248.08 --> 6253.28
yeah so everybody gets caught up in

6250.639 --> 6256.4800000000005
these stupid little hope schemes

6253.28 --> 6259.679
doing something about miserable people

6256.48 --> 6263.04
yeah no it's all

6259.679 --> 6265.679
[ __ ] all of it and good servant fell

6263.04 --> 6268.719
for it and he kind of crawled out of it

6265.679 --> 6271.28
because he has gone against tony

6268.719 --> 6272.96
tony got after me and then good servant

6271.28 --> 6274.88
defended me against that apparently i

6272.96 --> 6276.56
haven't seen it but he told me so in the

6274.88 --> 6279.92
email

6276.56 --> 6281.679
so he's regretting it good and now he

6279.92 --> 6283.84
wants to have his own show he always

6281.679 --> 6284.88
it was always about him wanting to have

6283.84 --> 6288.159000000001
his own show

6284.88 --> 6291.1990000000005
kind of like me and he wanted it with me

6288.159 --> 6293.119
first and then i said yeah no thanks

6291.199 --> 6294.32
because i don't want to be in a show

6293.119 --> 6299.839999999999
with him constantly

6294.32 --> 6299.84
absolutely not it's just not gonna

6300.84 --> 6306.56
happen

6303.199 --> 6308.239
and yeah i still banned him because i

6306.56 --> 6311.360000000001
can't trust him

6308.239 --> 6314.4
i just he's like he can

6311.36 --> 6317.839999999999
get insane like in a way that's just

6314.4 --> 6321.28
makes him unreliable

6317.84 --> 6322.96
so i don't want him in my chat

6321.28 --> 6325.28
as part of the show but he's still

6322.96 --> 6327.76
paypaling me

6325.28 --> 6329.199
i feel guilty or whatever i just nothing

6327.76 --> 6331.52
i could do about it

6329.199 --> 6334.159
it's weirding me out i will accept it

6331.52 --> 6336.400000000001
because i do need it

6334.159 --> 6338.719
yeah what am i gonna do just send it

6336.4 --> 6342.48

6338.719 --> 6342.4800000000005
what do you think should i send it back

6342.88 --> 6346.2390000000005
just to make a point

6346.639 --> 6350.159000000001
what do you think in chat

6350.8 --> 6359.84
i'm gonna you know 10 minutes the show

6354.4 --> 6359.839999999999

6440.84 --> 6443.84
so

6454.84 --> 6457.84
ah

6468.84 --> 6471.84
so

6472.239 --> 6478.799999999999
maybe keep it you need it

6475.84 --> 6479.84
yeah it's true i do need it thanks for

6478.8 --> 6484.400000000001
responding guys

6479.84 --> 6486.08
when i was gone

6484.4 --> 6488.08
it's just that it's weirding me out a

6486.08 --> 6490.0
little it it really weirded me out when

6488.08 --> 6493.679
he was still doing it

6490.0 --> 6495.6
well because just because he's helping

6493.679 --> 6498.0
me out doesn't mean i'm going to give

6495.6 --> 6499.280000000001
him some kind of platform connection

6498.0 --> 6500.88
whatever he's going to do is going to

6499.28 --> 6502.4
have to do it on my own i don't want

6500.88 --> 6505.679
that

6502.4 --> 6508.32
so if he's like kind of like sort of

6505.679 --> 6513.1990000000005
bribing me to connect

6508.32 --> 6515.92
i don't want that

6513.199 --> 6515.919999999999
i i don't

6517.76 --> 6520.96
it's too much has happened

6524.0 --> 6528.719
what are you talking about dutch sailor

6530.08 --> 6536.159
where is oh flat earth hey dude is that

6532.8 --> 6536.159000000001
the real flat earth poker

6538.08 --> 6542.8
no it's not your stupid sock account

6541.04 --> 6546.56
pretender

6542.8 --> 6546.56
get the [ __ ] out you piece of [ __ ]

6551.28 --> 6554.8
school shoe what the hell is wrong with

6553.599 --> 6557.4400000000005
you

6554.8 --> 6560.8
like what the [ __ ] is wrong with you man

6557.44 --> 6560.799999999999
you [ __ ] psycho

6562.0 --> 6569.119
like what is that even where in the plan

6565.44 --> 6574.08
is that gonna do anything

6569.119 --> 6574.08
like it doesn't make any damn sense

6578.639 --> 6583.84
yeah it's just some [ __ ] troll piece

6581.199 --> 6583.839999999999
of [ __ ]

6583.92 --> 6588.0
now don't dude he's taking on somebody

6587.199 --> 6591.119
else's name

6588.0 --> 6591.599
just saying so don't call him that that

6591.119 --> 6594.96
name

6591.599 --> 6596.2390000000005
is of a youtuber of a flat earther

6594.96 --> 6598.639
youtuber

6596.239 --> 6599.44
that he's taken that name specifically

6598.639 --> 6603.4400000000005
to get you

6599.44 --> 6605.04
all to respond to him using that name

6603.44 --> 6608.159
that's the trick

6605.04 --> 6611.679
see that's the trick

6608.159 --> 6613.92
so just when somebody like that pops up

6611.679 --> 6615.52
and they have a name of an established

6613.92 --> 6618.08
person and they're saying something that

6615.52 --> 6622.159000000001
that person obviously wouldn't say

6618.08 --> 6625.199
i ban it and you don't respond

6622.159 --> 6628.08
don't respond

6625.199 --> 6630.719
the fake out socks ever don't mention

6628.08 --> 6630.719
their names

6631.599 --> 6638.8
see because it's a part of their trick

6634.88 --> 6640.56
you didn't know okay that's fine

6638.8 --> 6644.400000000001
that's fine i'm just warning you because

6640.56 --> 6647.52
flattered folker is a guy on youtube

6644.4 --> 6650.799999999999
that i know i don't know him personally

6647.52 --> 6653.679
but i have been in his chat

6650.8 --> 6655.04
and all that he kind of does the same

6653.679 --> 6658.2390000000005
thing

6655.04 --> 6658.8
just start recording usually go hanging

6658.239 --> 6660.638999999999
around

6658.8 --> 6662.56
sometimes going to supermarkets and just

6660.639 --> 6666.0
blabbers on sometimes about flatter

6662.56 --> 6667.76
sometimes about corona whatever

6666.0 --> 6669.92
personally i don't think it's super

6667.76 --> 6673.87
interesting

6669.92 --> 6676.899
but yeah he's there

6673.87 --> 6676.899
[Music]

6677.679 --> 6682.32
never heard of him all right well he's

6680.4 --> 6685.839999999999
out there

6682.32 --> 6685.84
i think he still has a channel

6686.639 --> 6694.159000000001
let me see if he's still in my list

6690.96 --> 6697.44
yeah see

6694.159 --> 6698.4
i'll even link you up see if you like

6697.44 --> 6701.919999999999
anything about it

6698.4 --> 6706.0
if you want some more general talk

6701.92 --> 6708.8
then yeah you might like this guy

6706.0 --> 6710.8
but this link that i just put that's the

6708.8 --> 6712.639
real flat earth [ __ ] that's what the

6710.8 --> 6717.52
sock account was trying to

6712.639 --> 6717.52
provoke and you talking bad about him

6720.84 --> 6723.84
see

6727.119 --> 6732.88
and flat earth folker would never ever

6730.4 --> 6737.839999999999
say anything to that degree never do

6732.88 --> 6737.84
that not even as a joke

6750.8 --> 6756.639
and though yeah flatter focus does have

6753.52 --> 6759.280000000001
some trollish mood sometimes

6756.639 --> 6761.52
he can be like in irresponsible type

6759.28 --> 6764.96
behavior type modes

6761.52 --> 6766.96
but never really nasty you see that's

6764.96 --> 6769.199
the difference

6766.96 --> 6772.2390000000005
it's even kind of tough describing like

6769.199 --> 6779.839999999999
the balance of that sort of thing

6772.239 --> 6779.839999999999
but i'm trying

6792.239 --> 6795.598999999999
well matthew mitchell just thought he

6794.719 --> 6799.119
was gay

6795.599 --> 6803.360000000001
well the troll that did that absolutely

6799.119 --> 6803.36
was a gamma so he probably is gay

6804.84 --> 6810.400000000001
yeah what are my plans for tonight i

6807.679 --> 6810.4
don't have any

6813.679 --> 6817.599
i'm still considering whether i should

6815.52 --> 6821.76
skip on my newspaper rounds because it's

6817.599 --> 6824.88
just this disgusting headline

6821.76 --> 6827.4400000000005
about taking corona vaccines it's just

6824.88 --> 6835.84
i i think i'm just gonna flick it all in

6827.44 --> 6835.839999999999
the paper bin

6836.8 --> 6841.599
just severely repulsed by that i don't

6839.92 --> 6849.84
want to be part of spreading that sort

6841.599 --> 6849.84
of [ __ ]

6856.88 --> 6865.1990000000005
right i'm gonna run out the show though

6860.48 --> 6865.199
it's been uh quite a pessimistic show

6867.52 --> 6871.1990000000005
i do feel a little better but

6871.44 --> 6875.5199999999995
yeah this [ __ ] has been brewing for some

6873.679 --> 6878.88
time and i'm just

6875.52 --> 6881.360000000001
really done with the all the

6878.88 --> 6882.0
freaking [ __ ] and hope stories out

6881.36 --> 6891.839999999999
there i'm

6882.0 --> 6891.84
really done with it

6894.4 --> 6900.719
so yeah i hope you can forgive

6897.92 --> 6902.4800000000005
my attitude it's never really good to be

6900.719 --> 6904.32
like that

6902.48 --> 6907.199
even though i did highlight a couple of

6904.32 --> 6910.719
things that are very much there

6907.199 --> 6913.28
like the structure of it and i can

6910.719 --> 6915.599
seem to only be able to really address

6913.28 --> 6916.0
it from this perspective because if you

6915.599 --> 6919.76
have

6916.0 --> 6924.48
hope then that hope erases

6919.76 --> 6924.4800000000005
it it erases it from your site

6930.0 --> 6933.52
and then you just don't bring it up you

6932.239 --> 6936.718999999999
don't bring up these

6933.52 --> 6939.360000000001
inevitable nastiness that is

6936.719 --> 6941.36
just there just under the carpet and you

6939.36 --> 6943.44
can't get it away

6941.36 --> 6945.199
you can only lay that carpet over it you

6943.44 --> 6945.598999999999
can't get it away it's not going to go

6945.199 --> 6948.4
away

6945.599 --> 6949.679
ever you can just imagine that it is not

6948.4 --> 6951.5199999999995
there

6949.679 --> 6953.36
or it's not that bad or something's

6951.52 --> 6954.2390000000005
gonna happen to stop it but it's not

6953.36 --> 6957.199
going away

6954.239 --> 6958.959999999999
it's just there it always was there it's

6957.199 --> 6961.598999999999
always gonna [ __ ] be there

6958.96 --> 6964.0
it's just gonna get worse that's yeah

6961.599 --> 6966.719
that's the best you could hope for

6964.0 --> 6967.44
that is only gonna get worse and

6966.719 --> 6970.4800000000005
hopefully

6967.44 --> 6971.678999999999
not too quickly yeah that's the best you

6970.48 --> 6974.32
can hope for

6971.679 --> 6974.8
that is realistic that it doesn't get

6974.32 --> 6979.5199999999995
too

6974.8 --> 6979.52
bad too quickly right

6980.88 --> 6988.56
hopefully how ironic hopefully

6985.44 --> 6991.839999999999
i'll be in a better mood tomorrow like

6988.56 --> 6992.639
yeah i doubt it at this point but who

6991.84 --> 6995.52
knows

6992.639 --> 6996.719
i i just i really need some serious new

6995.52 --> 7000.159000000001
projects or as

6996.719 --> 7003.84
something to dig into something big that

7000.159 --> 7003.839999999999
i can actually work on that

7004.56 --> 7009.119000000001
it's a little bit more gratifying than

7006.639 --> 7012.56
just stewing here and realizing how much

7009.119 --> 7012.5599999999995
has gone to [ __ ] out there
