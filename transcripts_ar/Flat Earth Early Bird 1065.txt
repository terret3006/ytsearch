[Music]

94.799 --> 99.36000000000001
yeah it's kind of a

97.04 --> 102.399
gray

99.36 --> 104.0
not too dark but still gray soup

102.399 --> 106.799
up there

104.0 --> 108.64
can't really make out any cloud shapes

106.799 --> 111.28
in this

108.64 --> 114.6
uh it's not been raining so it's been

111.28 --> 114.6
pretty dry

116.56 --> 119.28
and

117.6 --> 122.32
no

119.28 --> 122.32000000000001
not too much wind

122.799 --> 129.03900000000002
it's still pretty cold though

125.759 --> 132.319
at least while they had not by mountain

129.039 --> 132.319
standards but it's yeah

132.72 --> 137.12
it's getting close to winter

135.28 --> 139.36
let me check the temperature

137.12 --> 143.48000000000002
oh hello by the way pj crew shank first

139.36 --> 143.48000000000002
in chat good to see you

146.72 --> 150.879
right it's 11 degrees celsius here

155.68 --> 157.84
right

158.48 --> 160.959
anyway

162.64 --> 166.23899999999998
it is tuesday the 9th

165.36 --> 170.04000000000002
of

166.239 --> 170.04
november 2021

175.12 --> 178.239
yesterday

176.4 --> 180.64000000000001
short show

178.239 --> 182.8
i think it was still entertaining and

180.64 --> 186.64
yeah i was really preoccupied with the

182.8 --> 189.44
guy being over we were very talkative

186.64 --> 191.51899999999998
and yeah that guy has some like well he

189.44 --> 193.519
has his own kind of sort of dark world

191.519 --> 195.84
experiences

193.519 --> 198.0
and well he's uh he's been busy for a

195.84 --> 199.92000000000002
while trying to map it all out to really

198.0 --> 202.239
get it cleared up what that really is

199.92 --> 204.0
not get too carried away be more

202.239 --> 205.84
analytical and

204.0 --> 208.0
i think that i've effectively been

205.84 --> 209.599
helping him with that

208.0 --> 211.2
as now

209.599 --> 214.07999999999998
it's also of course because of his own

211.2 --> 217.11999999999998
dedication it's the most important part

214.08 --> 218.72
he's just a lot more clear now less

217.12 --> 222.239
diffused and

218.72 --> 225.2
had some really great conversations

222.239 --> 229.68
and i pretty laid down

225.2 --> 231.92
pretty much in lay down in front of his

229.68 --> 234.959
in front of him

231.92 --> 236.48
very deep stuff that i still deal with

234.959 --> 238.48
just to see like

236.48 --> 241.84
if he

238.48 --> 245.2
like if it if he'd get it

241.84 --> 246.879
and yeah the guy has some

245.2 --> 249.599
hidden well i don't even know if it's

246.879 --> 252.319
hidden but he has wisdom

249.599 --> 252.319
he has like

252.64 --> 257.759
deeper insights too and it really comes

255.12 --> 258.56
out when he's much more clear-headed

257.759 --> 262.32
so

258.56 --> 262.32
yeah it was enervating

263.52 --> 268.4
and yeah also got me really distracted

265.84 --> 270.0
from the flat earth debate but i wasn't

268.4 --> 272.23999999999995
going to be able to get in between there

270.0 --> 274.24
anyway because nathan was just

272.24 --> 277.759
chewing down

274.24 --> 279.04
on that guy man was it feeding time oh

277.759 --> 282.04
[ __ ]

279.04 --> 282.04
ah

282.72 --> 287.36
and so i did cut we were listening to

284.4 --> 288.71999999999997
that a little bit too it was just like

287.36 --> 291.36
others

288.72 --> 293.04
trying to get in again and i knew like

291.36 --> 294.88
oh god come on guys you should know

293.04 --> 297.84000000000003
about it you're not gonna get in between

294.88 --> 297.84
that

298.0 --> 301.6
anyway

300.08 --> 304.71999999999997
yesterday was a

301.6 --> 304.72
innovating day for me

309.199 --> 315.56
i got some troll under soccer con

312.16 --> 315.56
johnny m

324.88 --> 327.199
what

328.32 --> 334.68
i have no idea what you're talking about

330.08 --> 334.68
pj crew shank i johnny m

338.8 --> 343.039
why is he saying that i don't know the

340.88 --> 346.8
context of what you're talking about

343.039 --> 346.8
anyway hello guided inspector

351.12 --> 353.84000000000003
right

374.4 --> 379.28
what else was going down yesterday

376.96 --> 381.68
because yeah i did kind of leave in the

379.28 --> 384.23999999999995
late afternoon

381.68 --> 384.24
and then

387.28 --> 393.4
oh yeah i met you from australia went

389.039 --> 393.4
live i think i missed them again

397.759 --> 400.8
keep on doing that

401.44 --> 405.919
right

402.4 --> 408.71999999999997
i did catch made by jim bob

405.919 --> 412.84
but he had a very short show he does a

408.72 --> 412.84000000000003
lot of like really short shows

422.56 --> 426.479
all right so what was i doing yesterday

424.8 --> 429.36
evening

426.479 --> 429.35999999999996
playing a game

433.36 --> 437.12
there's another way of

434.8 --> 439.55
figuring that out just watching my

437.12 --> 442.769
browser history

439.55 --> 442.769
[Music]

460.639 --> 463.639
huh

464.96 --> 468.4
anyway i didn't really go to bed that

466.639 --> 470.24
late i think that might have something

468.4 --> 472.479
to do with it

470.24 --> 472.479
uh

474.24 --> 479.84000000000003
in brandon's comment section

477.12 --> 479.84000000000003
brandon

481.12 --> 487.44
okay

483.039 --> 487.44
yeah has he gone live streaming again

487.52 --> 492.479
or is it just like old video comment

490.479 --> 494.96
sections

492.479 --> 497.28
because yeah trolls typically like to

494.96 --> 499.12
pile onto that like once you stop

497.28 --> 501.52
streaming then they suddenly pile on

499.12 --> 502.72
that last episode

501.52 --> 504.96
because they know people are

502.72 --> 508.0
instinctively gonna check those last

504.96 --> 509.599
episodes to see is like why they aren't

508.0 --> 511.919
live streaming

509.599 --> 515.4399999999999
then they get in your face like ah

511.919 --> 515.4399999999999
so all this nonsense

518.0 --> 521.0
right

523.289 --> 528.56
[Music]

525.04 --> 531.76
yeah tom it was called i never i dude i

528.56 --> 533.76
hadn't didn't have the volume loud up

531.76 --> 536.08
so i didn't even really properly hear

533.76 --> 537.8389999999999
this guy tom's voice

536.08 --> 539.839
because

537.839 --> 543.2790000000001
yeah we were having conversation if you

539.839 --> 547.2790000000001
then have nathan say well being nathan

543.279 --> 548.64
very loud that's super distracting

547.279 --> 550.64
so

548.64 --> 553.36
yeah but i'm gonna have a blast watching

550.64 --> 553.36
that one back

554.959 --> 558.7199999999999
really curious as to the details of what

557.04 --> 561.279
was actually really happening it was

558.72 --> 563.6
about the scientific method

561.279 --> 565.279
that much i did get out of it

563.6 --> 568.8000000000001
so he was trying to

565.279 --> 568.8
yeah losing the concept

569.279 --> 572.279
anyway

582.8 --> 588.24
where's everybody is it just you two

586.16 --> 591.24
not that i mind you two are great in my

588.24 --> 591.24
chat

594.959 --> 598.959
maybe something slipped through let me

596.8 --> 603.24
switch to live chat

598.959 --> 603.2399999999999
instead of top chat

608.0 --> 610.32
right

610.399 --> 614.64
oh yeah and this morning anyway

612.88 --> 617.64
before the show i was watching own

614.64 --> 617.64
benjamin

619.6 --> 624.72
good stuff

620.959 --> 624.7199999999999
i got roughly halfway

630.079 --> 634.3199999999999
talking about like the metaverse and

632.32 --> 635.44
like

634.32 --> 638.1600000000001
how they're trying to move the

635.44 --> 638.1600000000001
consciousness

640.56 --> 642.88
what

644.8 --> 652.12
oh really

646.959 --> 652.1199999999999
oh really chris ray what's my dad's name

666.48 --> 670.76
hello by the way stone monkey

674.32 --> 680.36
what's my dad's name chris derriere

677.12 --> 680.36
come on

695.279 --> 699.12
ah come on pj crew shank you're giving

697.36 --> 701.519
him too much honor

699.12 --> 704.0
that's not being an [ __ ] that's just

701.519 --> 705.92
bluffing like a 12 year old

704.0 --> 708.16
that's like one of the dumbest bluffs

705.92 --> 712.399
i've ever heard

708.16 --> 717.24
like he knows my dad oh right

712.399 --> 717.24
right so yeah what's his name

729.2 --> 734.0
right flaticorf music it is silliness

732.32 --> 734.88
it's like that's not an insult that's

734.0 --> 736.079
just

734.88 --> 739.92
really

736.079 --> 742.8
silly it's kind of funny right

739.92 --> 745.1999999999999
because it's so weak

742.8 --> 747.8389999999999
i mean if he suddenly brought out my

745.2 --> 749.6
dad's name then he might be a bit of a

747.839 --> 752.0
more of a troll

749.6 --> 756.399
and that would be creepy but

752.0 --> 758.32
it sounded like just like a 12 year old

756.399 --> 761.36
just blurting something out to try to

758.32 --> 761.36
seem dominant it's

768.16 --> 773.24
hello cps

769.76 --> 773.24
classical homeopath

779.279 --> 783.36
funnies always act like that i don't

781.2 --> 783.36
know

785.519 --> 791.76
maybe if they feel kind of weakened

789.44 --> 792.8000000000001
but they're still not ready to lay down

791.76 --> 794.56
their

792.8 --> 796.8
religious battle

794.56 --> 799.68
which they should periodically is

796.8 --> 801.68
healthier for you

799.68 --> 802.4799999999999
right you got to be

801.68 --> 805.3599999999999
just

802.48 --> 807.6800000000001
a person in the world too

805.36 --> 812.399
not just only

807.68 --> 812.399
anti-flat earther that's very unhealthy

813.44 --> 816.72
you'll get caught up in the ancestral

815.279 --> 819.72
winds

816.72 --> 819.72
anyway

834.24 --> 839.519
was saying he's a controlled op

836.88 --> 839.519
and chill

839.839 --> 846.399
is meant to be on our side what

844.079 --> 848.7199999999999
wait

846.399 --> 848.72
what

849.68 --> 854.279
isn't that like a double negative what

857.839 --> 862.0790000000001
so he basically said

859.92 --> 864.7199999999999
that i was really on

862.079 --> 865.76
the baller side i was an infiltrant for

864.72 --> 867.839
them

865.76 --> 871.279
that's fascinating

867.839 --> 875.1990000000001
oh if i am

871.279 --> 875.199
then that fact has been lost

876.079 --> 879.3599999999999
and withheld from me by my own

878.0 --> 882.16
subconscious

879.36 --> 882.16
maybe i am

883.519 --> 886.32
but i'm not consciously in the know of

885.6 --> 887.6
it

886.32 --> 890.1600000000001
anymore

887.6 --> 890.16
if ever

891.36 --> 896.32
maybe i secretly want to be that

894.0 --> 898.24
it's just that i'm on the

896.32 --> 900.88
i'm not in a position where i could

898.24 --> 902.0
actually realize that or maybe i can

900.88 --> 903.92
virtually

902.0 --> 906.32
yeah i know it's not making it more

903.92 --> 906.3199999999999
simple

907.12 --> 910.24
oh

908.0 --> 910.24
boo

911.279 --> 914.959
damn it

912.639 --> 916.24
brandon is controlled up

914.959 --> 918.0
how though

916.24 --> 922.16
how

918.0 --> 922.16
i think he's actually improved

922.32 --> 926.639
his sensibility and his like judgment

924.639 --> 928.9590000000001
skills and his managing skills like in

926.639 --> 932.48
the group of the show

928.959 --> 932.4799999999999
over the over the year

934.24 --> 939.199
right he's not keeping the bad things

937.04 --> 941.279
bad or making them worse he's he's

939.199 --> 943.5999999999999
actually improved the quality of the

941.279 --> 945.4399999999999
show overall

943.6 --> 948.5600000000001
so yeah that

945.44 --> 953.24
that wouldn't technically pan out

948.56 --> 953.2399999999999
if he was some kind of controlled up

956.48 --> 960.32
right a controlled up wouldn't be on the

959.12 --> 963.36
edge

960.32 --> 966.1600000000001
of like flat earth developments

963.36 --> 969.839
and keep growing with that

966.16 --> 969.8389999999999
but they can't do that

970.639 --> 977.759
they're always stuck behind us

973.92 --> 977.759
the anti-flat earth is just mimicking

981.44 --> 984.48
let's go brandon

983.279 --> 986.959
right

984.48 --> 989.759
now taking a break no

986.959 --> 992.2399999999999
it's been already told

989.759 --> 993.759
that he's he just got a new job and that

992.24 --> 994.72
job

993.759 --> 997.36
kind of

994.72 --> 999.6800000000001
gotten right on the normal time slot

997.36 --> 1002.639
when he would do his show

999.68 --> 1002.6389999999999
that was the issue

1005.92 --> 1010.759
jeremy is running his discord what

1015.04 --> 1021.399
brandon is the next

1017.04 --> 1021.399
brandon the next ranty

1026.079 --> 1029.9189999999999
no

1027.36 --> 1029.9189999999999
just no

1030.72 --> 1034.72
i would be very shocked if he suddenly

1033.679 --> 1037.3600000000001
like

1034.72 --> 1039.839
made a serious corner turn and said like

1037.36 --> 1039.839
yeah

1040.64 --> 1045.199
i'm retracting that i think it's flat

1045.6 --> 1051.12
it might be a globe after wow

1047.839 --> 1053.9189999999999
now brandon dude he's already displayed

1051.12 --> 1055.6789999999999
intrical insight on an intuitive level

1053.919 --> 1059.5200000000002
even about

1055.679 --> 1063.1200000000001
the realm and the arguments just like

1059.52 --> 1064.799
beyond by the way where ranty came like

1063.12 --> 1067.28
ranty

1064.799 --> 1069.44
broke off like in the middle of that

1067.28 --> 1071.9189999999999
development phase

1069.44 --> 1073.28
he intellectually broke off

1071.919 --> 1076.0
so he

1073.28 --> 1077.76
he got stuck right in between brandon

1076.0 --> 1080.64
went all the way

1077.76 --> 1082.799
there's no way back and like you just

1080.64 --> 1084.24
get you get touched

1082.799 --> 1087.12
by god

1084.24 --> 1088.48
in a way with the information it cannot

1087.12 --> 1090.3999999999999
be untouched

1088.48 --> 1094.16
so there's no way

1090.4 --> 1098.0
that he's actually secretly a baller

1094.16 --> 1098.0
or like ranty no

1099.12 --> 1103.1999999999998
there's no guarantee that he won't like

1101.12 --> 1105.28
switch for some other reason but that

1103.2 --> 1107.2
would be like a real shock that would be

1105.28 --> 1110.6399999999999
like holy [ __ ]

1107.2 --> 1113.039
he was like his life has been like

1110.64 --> 1116.0
totally clamped down and maybe some

1113.039 --> 1117.76
secret financial situation

1116.0 --> 1122.039
something really terrible and he had or

1117.76 --> 1122.039
he felt he had to do it

1123.76 --> 1128.799
but yeah that would be like

1126.96 --> 1130.16
that would really be shocking i i doubt

1128.799 --> 1132.16
that's gonna happen

1130.16 --> 1134.64
totally doubt it

1132.16 --> 1137.3600000000001
but he's not like randy

1134.64 --> 1139.919
because he gets it he gets the arguments

1137.36 --> 1139.9189999999999
much more

1140.16 --> 1143.16
anyway

1170.72 --> 1175.919
that's a beautiful way to express okay

1174.16 --> 1178.64
i thought it was just kind of like on

1175.919 --> 1180.24
target

1178.64 --> 1182.48
this is brandon's a very different

1180.24 --> 1184.24
person from randy very different

1182.48 --> 1187.64
very different type of character

1184.24 --> 1187.64
different energy

1193.12 --> 1195.36
yeah

1195.919 --> 1201.44
isn't it kind of funny though that

1197.919 --> 1205.0
ballers aren't saying that about me

1201.44 --> 1205.0
isn't it funny

1206.159 --> 1211.2800000000002
i mean i haven't

1207.76 --> 1213.84
bumped into any ballers that said that

1211.28 --> 1216.48
i mean i think some flat earthers

1213.84 --> 1219.039
out there might think that dude the bow

1216.48 --> 1220.96
and which one is the real one

1219.039 --> 1221.84
right

1220.96 --> 1223.679
well

1221.84 --> 1225.6
to be fair that's kind of like a

1223.679 --> 1227.6000000000001
legitimate question

1225.6 --> 1229.76
for them

1227.6 --> 1231.6789999999999
because i do play around with it

1229.76 --> 1234.32
like

1231.679 --> 1235.6000000000001
i get like that's normal to start asking

1234.32 --> 1239.84
that question

1235.6 --> 1239.84
i sometimes ask that question to myself

1240.88 --> 1244.4
i'm partially joking but

1246.4 --> 1249.76
yeah i don't see any ballers out there

1248.4 --> 1251.8400000000001
saying like oh

1249.76 --> 1254.4
irwin is secretly a

1251.84 --> 1254.3999999999999
baller and

1255.039 --> 1259.679
just pretending to be a flat earther

1257.2 --> 1262.72
maybe because

1259.679 --> 1264.0800000000002
they really think i'm that so they don't

1262.72 --> 1266.4
want to

1264.08 --> 1268.8799999999999
like they don't want to

1266.4 --> 1271.6000000000001
blow my cover

1268.88 --> 1271.6000000000001
in plain

1274.84 --> 1279.12
sight getting a little sillier

1289.28 --> 1292.8799999999999
all right

1291.039 --> 1296.48
i mean i've had like

1292.88 --> 1298.72
minor gamma chat comments

1296.48 --> 1301.1200000000001
but that's been happening even before i

1298.72 --> 1303.1200000000001
started doing ballwin stuff

1301.12 --> 1304.799
and that's like the typical it's a

1303.12 --> 1306.4799999999998
typical troll frequency and they just

1304.799 --> 1308.559
said like all right you can't be serious

1306.48 --> 1311.52
now you then it's more like a

1308.559 --> 1313.28
gaslighting attempt

1311.52 --> 1315.28
i get that

1313.28 --> 1317.36
it's always in my presence but i don't

1315.28 --> 1321.28
hear like any gossip about arwen

1317.36 --> 1321.28
secretly being a baller or anything

1321.6 --> 1324.799
yeah whatever

1328.159 --> 1332.5200000000002
why would you pretend to be a fe

1339.919 --> 1344.0800000000002
oh that would depend on the context you

1341.84 --> 1344.08
know

1344.64 --> 1349.6000000000001
maybe you're trying to achieve something

1346.559 --> 1352.559
maybe you have an agenda an agenda

1349.6 --> 1352.559
of some kind

1356.32 --> 1359.6
like let's just

1357.84 --> 1362.0
get a little complicated here do

1359.6 --> 1366.559
something like a what-if situation

1362.0 --> 1366.559
so what if i was actually a baller

1366.64 --> 1370.64
that realized that the ball is a

1368.72 --> 1371.84
religion

1370.64 --> 1373.919
wanted to

1371.84 --> 1376.48
actually champion that religion then

1373.919 --> 1380.5590000000002
realized there was the truth would come

1376.48 --> 1380.559
out and that would destroy everything

1381.52 --> 1385.12
and that's why i had to become a flat

1383.919 --> 1388.0
earther

1385.12 --> 1390.799
actually basically lose the luxury of

1388.0 --> 1393.2
the pure suspense of disbelief

1390.799 --> 1396.48
to be able to save it

1393.2 --> 1396.48
for other generations

1399.44 --> 1402.919
think about it

1405.36 --> 1410.9599999999998
arguably that is psychologically what

1408.48 --> 1412.799
did really happen to me now once you

1410.96 --> 1414.159
actually become a flat earther the

1412.799 --> 1415.76
problem is

1414.159 --> 1417.919
everything changes

1415.76 --> 1420.48
so the original motivations you might

1417.919 --> 1420.48
have had

1420.96 --> 1424.4
work differently

1422.799 --> 1426.6399999999999
when you become a flat earther because

1424.4 --> 1428.24
you it just works differently you don't

1426.64 --> 1431.2
see things this

1428.24 --> 1435.2
things don't look the same

1431.2 --> 1435.2
energy doesn't feel the same

1436.32 --> 1440.32
but

1437.76 --> 1440.32
in a way

1440.559 --> 1444.6399999999999
i still

1442.799 --> 1447.52
want to honor that mission and that's

1444.64 --> 1450.7990000000002
how i devised

1447.52 --> 1453.9189999999999
the my visionary plan

1450.799 --> 1456.48
for a dual cosmogonical society

1453.919 --> 1459.039
of which the elements already exist it's

1456.48 --> 1462.159
just that

1459.039 --> 1464.64
the intentions that are feeding

1462.159 --> 1466.0
it which come from persons

1464.64 --> 1468.5590000000002
from people

1466.0 --> 1470.84
like the polarization in that is still

1468.559 --> 1474.3999999999999
rife and

1470.84 --> 1476.72
it's it's not going to help so

1474.4 --> 1479.3600000000001
the way to accomplish my vision is to

1476.72 --> 1480.88
completely depolarize

1479.36 --> 1483.9189999999999
the situation

1480.88 --> 1486.48
and revert it back

1483.919 --> 1488.3200000000002
from some religious battle to a

1486.48 --> 1492.08
philosophical

1488.32 --> 1492.08
struggle and debate

1492.72 --> 1496.96
and where people have more control over

1495.12 --> 1499.12
their faculties

1496.96 --> 1501.3600000000001
and have more trust in themselves so

1499.12 --> 1502.9599999999998
that they like myself

1501.36 --> 1505.6
will be able

1502.96 --> 1507.279
to switch

1505.6 --> 1510.1589999999999
and do what i do

1507.279 --> 1513.64
to a certain degree

1510.159 --> 1513.64
and be philosophers

1518.559 --> 1524.48
the concept anyone who believes the

1520.64 --> 1526.4
radius of earth is beyond absurd

1524.48 --> 1529.76
well if you're going to analyze it

1526.4 --> 1532.4
mechanically old horse redbound yeah

1529.76 --> 1532.4
absolutely

1532.64 --> 1535.76
but

1533.919 --> 1539.279
when it comes to like can the

1535.76 --> 1542.48
consciousness accept it as a concept

1539.279 --> 1545.36
it's not that hard in rel in relation

1542.48 --> 1546.799
unless you really hold on to mechanical

1545.36 --> 1548.24
thinking

1546.799 --> 1550.72
then yeah

1548.24 --> 1553.039
then it just you can't make it fit right

1550.72 --> 1555.2
it's the most fallacious concept

1553.039 --> 1557.2
humanity has ever devised

1555.2 --> 1560.48
but it's not about being correct it's

1557.2 --> 1563.76
about is your mind able

1560.48 --> 1563.76
to accept it

1564.48 --> 1568.52
how does that work why

1572.64 --> 1576.159
it's a dream

1574.64 --> 1578.64
and it is

1576.159 --> 1580.88
has the nature of a dream

1578.64 --> 1583.5200000000002
how do dreams work why do dreams

1580.88 --> 1585.44
represent themselves to you

1583.52 --> 1588.08
as they do

1585.44 --> 1591.2
there's mechanisms in there too

1588.08 --> 1592.48
you might be surprised like

1591.2 --> 1593.679
how

1592.48 --> 1598.6
the ball

1593.679 --> 1598.6000000000001
is kind of constructed like a dream

1608.039 --> 1614.8799999999999
philosophically absurd as well

1611.2 --> 1620.2
right well absurdities are

1614.88 --> 1620.2
much easier to adopt in philosophy

1626.4 --> 1631.76
right

1628.559 --> 1633.76
fellas philosophy is much more prone to

1631.76 --> 1636.1589999999999
absurdities than

1633.76 --> 1639.2
mechanical physical reality

1636.159 --> 1642.44
which is extremely rigid

1639.2 --> 1642.44
and inflexible

1657.919 --> 1660.5590000000002
all right things just work the way they

1659.84 --> 1662.559
do

1660.559 --> 1664.559
that doesn't change in your mind

1662.559 --> 1666.6399999999999
anything can change

1664.559 --> 1669.6399999999999
if you allow it

1666.64 --> 1669.64
anyway

1673.12 --> 1678.32
who is this sean

1676.399 --> 1683.32
gasser

1678.32 --> 1683.32
sometimes go on about what

1690.32 --> 1693.2
hello at place

1692.24 --> 1695.76
are you

1693.2 --> 1697.679
referring to sean hawkins who is kind of

1695.76 --> 1700.24
obsessing over me with his stupid little

1697.679 --> 1704.279
videos about me

1700.24 --> 1704.279
i don't know what you're talking about

1713.76 --> 1717.64
stockholm system

1746.0 --> 1749.76
no gadget inspector

1748.0 --> 1751.44
well i know what you mean but that's

1749.76 --> 1752.399
technically probably not what would

1751.44 --> 1755.3600000000001
happen

1752.399 --> 1758.6399999999999
let's just say that physical reality the

1755.36 --> 1760.6399999999999
matrix recrystallizes somehow

1758.64 --> 1763.039
and earth turns out to be a ball and

1760.64 --> 1764.7990000000002
even so like that would just mean like

1763.039 --> 1767.44
holy [ __ ]

1764.799 --> 1770.08
we have to completely

1767.44 --> 1772.3990000000001
retailer physics

1770.08 --> 1775.6
but with empiricism right you can't just

1772.399 --> 1776.6399999999999
like oh yeah the model the model of the

1775.6 --> 1778.559
ball

1776.64 --> 1781.039
it's virtue all of that is virtual it's

1778.559 --> 1783.6
mathematical right but if actual

1781.039 --> 1785.12
physical reality turned out to

1783.6 --> 1788.7199999999998
basically

1785.12 --> 1788.7199999999998
yeah be like that

1788.96 --> 1793.919
similar then we'd actually have to start

1791.76 --> 1796.32
measuring [ __ ] up and like figure out

1793.919 --> 1797.8400000000001
like how is this freaking gas sticking

1796.32 --> 1801.039
to this ball

1797.84 --> 1803.039
like everything we learn about physics

1801.039 --> 1805.919
make that impossible

1803.039 --> 1807.52
so we have to then actually using

1805.919 --> 1809.3600000000001
empiricism

1807.52 --> 1811.9189999999999
figure out physics

1809.36 --> 1813.52
in this bizarre

1811.919 --> 1815.5200000000002
ball

1813.52 --> 1818.24
with which gas is sticking to in the

1815.52 --> 1820.1589999999999
outer space universe

1818.24 --> 1822.48
reality

1820.159 --> 1824.7990000000002
right it's not just like oh oh

1822.48 --> 1826.72
it turns out to be well okay i'm just

1824.799 --> 1828.32
letting this go no no it would be like

1826.72 --> 1830.48
holy [ __ ]

1828.32 --> 1834.1589999999999
why was that wrong

1830.48 --> 1836.08
we have to redo it and not like oh erase

1834.159 --> 1838.7990000000002
it and let's start over again but like

1836.08 --> 1840.72
test every segment and then like

1838.799 --> 1842.08
actually physically test it out there

1840.72 --> 1844.559
and all that right

1842.08 --> 1847.1999999999998
that's what you want to be doing

1844.559 --> 1849.2
but yeah the thing is reality physical

1847.2 --> 1851.679
reality and these established facts

1849.2 --> 1853.8400000000001
don't actually just change

1851.679 --> 1856.0
overnight

1853.84 --> 1858.399
this isn't a matrix

1856.0 --> 1860.399
like that that's just like oh it's been

1858.399 --> 1864.32
fulfilled now

1860.399 --> 1867.279
the architect does the new version

1864.32 --> 1869.2
everything is dearest and re-rest right

1867.279 --> 1872.399
that's

1869.2 --> 1874.3990000000001
not exactly how the physics mechanics

1872.399 --> 1876.4799999999998
work because they're rigid they don't

1874.399 --> 1879.4399999999998
change other things might change or

1876.48 --> 1881.039
spirits might change

1879.44 --> 1883.039
even our

1881.039 --> 1884.559
time perception might change like all

1883.039 --> 1888.8799999999999
kinds of things through the spirit can

1884.559 --> 1888.8799999999999
change the physical mechanics though

1889.039 --> 1893.84
they don't

1890.84 --> 1896.72
change has never been witnessed

1893.84 --> 1899.039
like a certain complete change of the

1896.72 --> 1901.2
physics has never been witnessed ever

1899.039 --> 1904.1589999999999
never been recorded in any form never

1901.2 --> 1907.1200000000001
any kind of event new things happen that

1904.159 --> 1909.2
were misunderstood

1907.12 --> 1913.4399999999998
but things that always worked the way

1909.2 --> 1915.519
they did never just suddenly changed

1913.44 --> 1918.0
right unless

1915.519 --> 1920.88
i don't know biology might be involved

1918.0 --> 1924.72
but the non-biology physical reality

1920.88 --> 1927.2
never just changed there is no

1924.72 --> 1928.88
trace of any of that

1927.2 --> 1931.44
and that's why

1928.88 --> 1934.5590000000002
the physics community and science actual

1931.44 --> 1938.3200000000002
science has relied so much also upon

1934.559 --> 1940.8799999999999
the stability of natural laws

1938.32 --> 1942.799
because it never changed

1940.88 --> 1945.44
you see

1942.799 --> 1945.44
so yeah

1946.399 --> 1949.7199999999998
what's that

1961.76 --> 1964.8799999999999
oh it's him again

1965.6 --> 1969.36
yeah yeah i really don't like

1971.84 --> 1979.519
yeah socially inept goblinoid fanatics

1977.2 --> 1982.799
that obsess

1979.519 --> 1986.159
so yeah i get a little rough on you

1982.799 --> 1986.1589999999999
that's right cult stomper

1988.48 --> 1992.32
yeah yeah yeah bring out the quote

1998.159 --> 2002.7990000000002
my photo photographs and like try to

2000.72 --> 2005.519
find the silliest moments you can i want

2002.799 --> 2008.559
a published letter back

2005.519 --> 2011.84
high quality paper book

2008.559 --> 2011.84
with all my quotes

2012.799 --> 2017.76
and real photographs i i demand you make

2015.84 --> 2020.08
that

2017.76 --> 2022.08
and you send it to every

2020.08 --> 2023.279
anti-flat earther and baller and

2022.08 --> 2024.6399999999999
newcomer

2023.279 --> 2026.64
through the mail

2024.64 --> 2027.76
called stomper do it

2026.64 --> 2030.159
do it

2027.76 --> 2030.1589999999999
do it

2030.72 --> 2033.84
you know you wanna

2037.279 --> 2041.36
i mean maybe that will ruin my

2039.519 --> 2045.08
reputation

2041.36 --> 2045.08
maybe that will help

2046.72 --> 2050.079
red worthy effort

2052.56 --> 2055.2799999999997
what are you doing

2057.599 --> 2063.44
stop deleting the messages i'm having a

2059.919 --> 2063.44
conversation with the troll

2067.359 --> 2074.3199999999997
my obvious psychosis oh really how

2071.919 --> 2077.359
i'm just going to analyze the [ __ ] out

2074.32 --> 2078.3990000000003
of everything you say

2077.359 --> 2081.5989999999997
to

2078.399 --> 2082.399
make it plain and obvious that

2081.599 --> 2084.639
like

2082.399 --> 2088.3199999999997
you're not really inserting anything

2084.639 --> 2090.32
that i haven't like already heard at

2088.32 --> 2093.119
least a hundred times

2090.32 --> 2095.9190000000003
and i'm able to adapt to like in less

2093.119 --> 2095.9190000000003
than a second

2096.879 --> 2100.16
you're not doing anything

2101.28 --> 2105.8390000000004
i mean maybe if you publish that book

2106.079 --> 2109.92
then maybe you'll get my attention

2111.68 --> 2115.3199999999997
i don't have a reputation

2118.4 --> 2121.04
i don't know

2121.52 --> 2125.119
hey

2123.839 --> 2127.68
clutch

2125.119 --> 2131.04
i'm gonna retract wrenches here if you

2127.68 --> 2133.7599999999998
don't stop it all of you i'm gonna undo

2131.04 --> 2136.96
all your wrenches if you don't

2133.76 --> 2140.92
stay the [ __ ] out of my chat with that

2136.96 --> 2140.92
[ __ ] okay people

2148.72 --> 2153.9199999999996
yeah i know they're delusional

2151.119 --> 2153.92
but they're there

2154.8 --> 2158.2400000000002
don't

2155.92 --> 2161.119
don't interrupt

2158.24 --> 2163.2
my handling of the trolls right you

2161.119 --> 2165.839
don't interrupt nathan when he's feeding

2163.2 --> 2168.3199999999997
on an anti-flat earther in the discord

2165.839 --> 2172.0
you don't start deleting messages with

2168.32 --> 2174.079
trolls i'm having conversations with

2172.0 --> 2176.079
even though they're not listening

2174.079 --> 2177.44
the thing is they can't talk through me

2176.079 --> 2182.3590000000004
you see

2177.44 --> 2182.359
and i have an extra edge here

2191.68 --> 2196.72
it's just so like you're that creepy

2194.16 --> 2198.3199999999997
virgin in his mom's room

2196.72 --> 2199.7599999999998
what

2198.32 --> 2201.3590000000004
you mean

2199.76 --> 2202.7200000000003
my mom

2201.359 --> 2203.7599999999998
that died

2202.72 --> 2206.8799999999997
16

2203.76 --> 2206.88
15 years ago

2207.119 --> 2209.359
hmm

2210.4 --> 2215.6800000000003
no clue what i'm talking about instantly

2212.64 --> 2217.68
blocking anybody who disagrees except

2215.68 --> 2221.1189999999997
i'm actually

2217.68 --> 2225.52
lashing out against my

2221.119 --> 2225.52
followers that are very loyal to me

2226.4 --> 2231.839
and telling them not to do that

2229.52 --> 2235.28
see that's why i don't want those

2231.839 --> 2235.2799999999997
messages deleted because

2236.48 --> 2242.079
like that'll only make them feel like

2239.52 --> 2244.16
they have any sort of power here that

2242.079 --> 2246.6400000000003
they can make predictions

2244.16 --> 2248.48
because they're counting on base

2246.64 --> 2251.2799999999997
behavior

2248.48 --> 2252.32
if you just ascend like two levels above

2251.28 --> 2254.4
that

2252.32 --> 2257.04
then they have no grip whatsoever and

2254.4 --> 2259.04
you can without any effort

2257.04 --> 2262.4
dispel

2259.04 --> 2263.52
every single detail of what they feel

2262.4 --> 2265.6800000000003
and say

2263.52 --> 2268.32
and make them look like and feel like

2265.68 --> 2269.2
complete asses which they really are you

2268.32 --> 2270.6400000000003
see

2269.2 --> 2272.72
so don't

2270.64 --> 2276.16
don't delete it it's only when they like

2272.72 --> 2278.48
really start mass spamming or something

2276.16 --> 2281.68
oh god yeah that's something else dude

2278.48 --> 2281.68
you get the [ __ ] out here

2283.28 --> 2285.8390000000004
don't do that

2293.839 --> 2300.0
yeah you can go after me

2297.119 --> 2301.119
you don't go after people in my chat

2300.0 --> 2304.079
like that

2301.119 --> 2304.079
yeah you bastard

2307.76 --> 2312.2000000000003
that's not how this show works

2317.2 --> 2321.1189999999997
right

2319.2 --> 2324.48
although that one question got any

2321.119 --> 2327.359
evidence for the magical pancake earth

2324.48 --> 2329.68
with physics defying dome

2327.359 --> 2331.44
poofed into existence by an invisible

2329.68 --> 2334.0
wizard

2331.44 --> 2335.52
that's a straw man question that you

2334.0 --> 2338.72
know it's a straw man question and

2335.52 --> 2341.359
nathan's like addressed that and spent

2338.72 --> 2343.4399999999996
probably over a hundred hours all

2341.359 --> 2345.68
combined

2343.44 --> 2348.64
in just the last year

2345.68 --> 2350.72
addressing how that is an unbelievable

2348.64 --> 2352.839
stupid strawman

2350.72 --> 2356.72
to which nathan never even

2352.839 --> 2359.119
hinted that he stood behind that exact

2356.72 --> 2359.1189999999997
model

2360.8 --> 2366.119
who is the gay wizard

2362.8 --> 2366.119
i don't know

2370.079 --> 2373.079
oh

2386.96 --> 2390.88
all right well yeah what we're gonna

2388.72 --> 2393.1189999999997
call him an old gay wizard

2390.88 --> 2395.28
it's kind of silly

2393.119 --> 2398.0
i mean

2395.28 --> 2400.48
that's those are all very typical

2398.0 --> 2402.56
human-based traits

2400.48 --> 2406.4
very sure that uh

2402.56 --> 2406.4
the designer of all of this

2406.48 --> 2413.28
he might be able to laugh at it too

2408.319 --> 2413.2799999999997
especially because the stupidity of it

2413.44 --> 2419.2400000000002
of assigning those human traits to the

2416.24 --> 2419.24
designer

2442.079 --> 2446.4
hello andrew by the way an llp

2444.64 --> 2449.4
old house rod bound

2446.4 --> 2449.4
crockett

2458.4 --> 2463.52
i mean mentioning your mom is awful well

2461.68 --> 2466.16
maybe

2463.52 --> 2468.88
maybe it is awful

2466.16 --> 2471.92
it's not awful to me

2468.88 --> 2475.28
because like that statement is so

2471.92 --> 2476.4
stereotyping and so far off my actual

2475.28 --> 2478.0
reality

2476.4 --> 2480.96
that it's just funny because it just

2478.0 --> 2484.079
goes to show how easily they fall for

2480.96 --> 2487.599
that stereotyping description

2484.079 --> 2490.5600000000004
which is a sign of weakness it's a sign

2487.599 --> 2492.7200000000003
that you don't actually have a grip over

2490.56 --> 2493.599
who somebody you're trying to ridicule

2492.72 --> 2495.7599999999998
is

2493.599 --> 2497.119
it's cheap it's a cheap

2495.76 --> 2499.5200000000004
move

2497.119 --> 2502.56
and not necessarily a low blow

2499.52 --> 2502.56
it's just cheap

2504.48 --> 2509.76
because it shows you have very little

2506.64 --> 2513.0789999999997
creative insight and yeah oversight over

2509.76 --> 2513.079
your target

2525.76 --> 2529.119
ballers have faith in gravity yeah i'm

2527.44 --> 2530.7200000000003
sure they do but they don't know what it

2529.119 --> 2532.56
is though

2530.72 --> 2534.16
but i guess that makes sense

2532.56 --> 2537.839
to them

2534.16 --> 2537.839
hello james mason by the way

2552.96 --> 2558.359
you are not allowed to hit below the van

2555.04 --> 2558.359
allen valve

2567.359 --> 2571.359
i get you but they are still i know

2572.0 --> 2579.839
but censorship is not the solution it's

2575.44 --> 2579.839
only going to polarize them further

2582.0 --> 2587.359
to undo the vile aspect you gotta let it

2584.72 --> 2589.7599999999998
you gotta kind of like see it as if they

2587.359 --> 2591.68
are just trying to vent their stress

2589.76 --> 2594.3190000000004
their pain

2591.68 --> 2597.9199999999996
the pettier it is

2594.319 --> 2597.92
the more it must be hurting

2598.72 --> 2605.04
what makes it stop hurting well a

2601.28 --> 2606.7200000000003
solution to that situation the energy

2605.04 --> 2608.72
understanding

2606.72 --> 2610.24
is the key to that

2608.72 --> 2612.0
self-understanding how do you get

2610.24 --> 2614.16
through to somebody that polarizes

2612.0 --> 2615.839
themselves against you

2614.16 --> 2618.0
by

2615.839 --> 2619.52
not accepting

2618.0 --> 2621.119
that they are

2619.52 --> 2622.88
what they think they are that they are

2621.119 --> 2625.119
my enemy

2622.88 --> 2627.92
and then you depolarize them you

2625.119 --> 2631.04
just treat them like okay boy

2627.92 --> 2632.96
now you think you're a hot shot but

2631.04 --> 2635.52
when you get older

2632.96 --> 2639.599
and wiser you realize that this sort of

2635.52 --> 2639.599
behavior is unnecessary

2642.079 --> 2646.2400000000002
and it's not as bad as it feels right

2644.4 --> 2649.2400000000002
now

2646.24 --> 2649.24
depolarization

2651.119 --> 2654.1600000000003
gonna need r for that

2666.72 --> 2669.72
so

2688.72 --> 2691.72
what

2691.839 --> 2697.92
okay inspector

2694.72 --> 2697.9199999999996
no i didn't see that

2698.16 --> 2703.5989999999997
but yeah i'm not surprised that they put

2700.24 --> 2706.3999999999996
us in the lit it wasn't they can't be in

2703.599 --> 2708.4
like an exclusive flat earther blame

2706.4 --> 2710.8
but they probably have like a whole list

2708.4 --> 2712.48
of things that they marcus these are the

2710.8 --> 2716.04
causes and flat earthers might have been

2712.48 --> 2716.04
among them yeah

2719.359 --> 2723.4
all right yeah post link

2754.319 --> 2758.599
hmm hey jason brown

2768.72 --> 2771.72
hmm

2789.04 --> 2792.839
okay i'll take a look

2802.079 --> 2806.2400000000002
wait that's a government guy

2806.48 --> 2809.88
are you sure

2816.72 --> 2820.8799999999997
savior

2818.72 --> 2823.1189999999997
back here

2820.88 --> 2825.92
is health

2823.119 --> 2825.92
do you want some what

2827.119 --> 2829.28
but

2829.599 --> 2835.599
what happened to like the [ __ ] guy

2833.44 --> 2838.56
i thought that was somebody did

2835.599 --> 2842.28
did they get fired or something

2838.56 --> 2842.2799999999997
what's going on

2852.559 --> 2856.88
or was that another country huh

2857.44 --> 2862.0
do you think it's possible that the moon

2859.52 --> 2862.0
is a map

2869.599 --> 2873.88
maybe

2870.8 --> 2875.76
but if it is it seems to be like a

2873.88 --> 2877.6800000000003
systematically

2875.76 --> 2879.28
disrupted map

2877.68 --> 2881.7599999999998
it's distorted

2879.28 --> 2884.0
might have been like what we see

2881.76 --> 2888.2400000000002
if you twist it here and there then it

2884.0 --> 2889.839
can sort of yeah fit

2888.24 --> 2894.5589999999997
but

2889.839 --> 2894.5589999999997
it's obviously distorted like warped

2894.64 --> 2900.64
like looking through a warped mirror in

2897.2 --> 2901.5989999999997
a hall of mirrors

2900.64 --> 2904.5589999999997
so

2901.599 --> 2908.119
it's not a very precise map for sure if

2904.559 --> 2908.119
it is a map

2921.119 --> 2929.2400000000002
van halen isn't van halen

2924.079 --> 2929.2400000000002
without david lee roth what

2929.68 --> 2935.1189999999997
is it what

2931.76 --> 2935.119
i don't know what you're talking about

2938.24 --> 2943.319
anyway

2939.359 --> 2943.319
i'll be back in two minutes

2962.48 --> 2965.48
so

3034.24 --> 3037.24
ta-da

3040.96 --> 3046.28
what steamy traveler

3043.28 --> 3046.28
hello

3068.079 --> 3077.3590000000004
if it is a map then wow well look blue

3071.599 --> 3079.2000000000003
4j or or is it blue y for f whatever

3077.359 --> 3081.119
if it is a map wow well yeah there's

3079.2 --> 3084.0
only one way to really find out and it

3081.119 --> 3087.52
is to try and

3084.0 --> 3088.48
confirm the other land masses on the map

3087.52 --> 3089.599
then

3088.48 --> 3092.079
right

3089.599 --> 3096.6400000000003
and if what we find

3092.079 --> 3099.04
pans out to be similarly distorted

3096.64 --> 3100.0789999999997
then yeah then it is kind of a distorted

3099.04 --> 3103.52
map

3100.079 --> 3106.319
but yeah we there is no confirmation

3103.52 --> 3109.2
of the other land masses that

3106.319 --> 3111.7599999999998
seem to appear on the moon map

3109.2 --> 3114.319
so yeah it's still

3111.76 --> 3116.8
it's still fuzzy at best just don't know

3114.319 --> 3116.8
for sure

3121.76 --> 3127.28
we don't know like what it represents

3125.04 --> 3130.4
like maybe it

3127.28 --> 3134.559
okay let's get a little weird here

3130.4 --> 3134.559
let's put another scoop on top of that

3135.119 --> 3140.7200000000003
what if the moon

3137.599 --> 3142.079
is reflecting

3140.72 --> 3144.5589999999997
several

3142.079 --> 3146.48
realm segments

3144.559 --> 3149.8390000000004
but kind of fusing them even though

3146.48 --> 3153.119
they're looping wise not interconnected

3149.839 --> 3155.52
so maybe it's like a like a distorted

3153.119 --> 3157.44
mirror that actually

3155.52 --> 3159.839
mirror

3157.44 --> 3164.2400000000002
that reflects

3159.839 --> 3165.2799999999997
beyond space itself beyond physical

3164.24 --> 3167.2799999999997
volume

3165.28 --> 3170.96
because it is holographic in nature so

3167.28 --> 3170.96
maybe that makes that possible

3171.68 --> 3176.0789999999997
right so maybe you're seeing like the

3173.92 --> 3180.319
reflection of four different realm

3176.079 --> 3181.599
segments or something or three

3180.319 --> 3184.48
warped

3181.599 --> 3186.4
like warped together

3184.48 --> 3188.96
which makes it even confusing more

3186.4 --> 3190.319
confusing because they don't actually

3188.96 --> 3196.319
intersect

3190.319 --> 3196.319
in reality they're loop-wise cut off ah

3198.0 --> 3201.72
it's your mind gravy

3208.4 --> 3212.8
plausible and possible plausible i don't

3211.04 --> 3213.68
know possible

3212.8 --> 3217.04
yeah

3213.68 --> 3217.04
technically i think it is

3217.2 --> 3220.0789999999997
but

3217.92 --> 3222.7200000000003
dude there are so many

3220.079 --> 3225.04
potential possibilities

3222.72 --> 3227.68
as to what's out there and how it's out

3225.04 --> 3230.4
there and i've tried to dig through

3227.68 --> 3232.48
every thing i've ever thought of

3230.4 --> 3235.48
up about it so

3232.48 --> 3235.48
yeah

3236.0 --> 3239.2
i'm sure i'm gonna think of even more

3238.319 --> 3240.64
things

3239.2 --> 3242.24
although i don't know if it's really

3240.64 --> 3244.48
gonna

3242.24 --> 3246.8799999999997
top

3244.48 --> 3249.88
everything else that i thought about so

3246.88 --> 3249.88
far

3268.0 --> 3273.119
all right yeah get it inspected dude

3270.0 --> 3275.839
that that's little tiny wumble cps is

3273.119 --> 3275.839
tiny wumble

3276.559 --> 3283.6800000000003
and he said that like he done it at the

3279.359 --> 3283.68
start he done that last year

3284.24 --> 3289.839
i think

3286.4 --> 3292.2400000000002
no wait no was this may he said he was

3289.839 --> 3293.92
gonna do it then he did it and i don't

3292.24 --> 3295.04
know man i don't even know if that's

3293.92 --> 3297.76
even true

3295.04 --> 3301.7599999999998
if that's real

3297.76 --> 3301.76
maybe he's getting a placebo

3302.16 --> 3307.68
because he still seems to be around

3305.359 --> 3309.92
so i don't know about that

3307.68 --> 3309.9199999999996
dude

3312.24 --> 3318.319
to help protect other people that's

3314.079 --> 3321.8390000000004
[ __ ] cbs that's full blown [ __ ]

3318.319 --> 3321.839
it doesn't protect other people

3322.24 --> 3326.04
that's a rumor

3324.079 --> 3328.88
that has no

3326.04 --> 3330.64
confirmed foundation

3328.88 --> 3333.839
even in the claim

3330.64 --> 3337.2
no that's a rumor that's spread around

3333.839 --> 3338.48
has never been confirmed never been

3337.2 --> 3341.839
confirmed

3338.48 --> 3345.44
never been confirmed by them

3341.839 --> 3347.359
never been confirmed by them

3345.44 --> 3350.079
the saying

3347.359 --> 3353.359
popular saying it helps protect other

3350.079 --> 3356.48
people is a rumor

3353.359 --> 3358.24
it's never been confirmed it's actually

3356.48 --> 3360.559
been disclaimed by a whole bunch of

3358.24 --> 3362.4799999999996
people in governments

3360.559 --> 3364.799
and the medical system

3362.48 --> 3367.68
and the ones that actually devise the

3364.799 --> 3370.0
very technology it uses

3367.68 --> 3370.0
yeah

3370.16 --> 3375.0
you might want to let go of that rumor

3398.88 --> 3401.88
do

3407.92 --> 3412.64
hey good morning

3410.0 --> 3412.64
service day

3416.799 --> 3421.7599999999998
by the way i hope you guys now have the

3418.88 --> 3426.079
confirmation that that icon

3421.76 --> 3426.079
service day uses is actually him

3431.52 --> 3437.319
because you saw him yesterday

3434.079 --> 3437.319
on camera

3446.72 --> 3452.8799999999997
oh jeff daughtery

3448.799 --> 3452.88
deleted all his youtube videos right

3454.48 --> 3458.839
what he didn't even download them and

3456.4 --> 3460.48
then re-upload them that's a

3458.839 --> 3463.119
shame

3460.48 --> 3465.2
i have downloaded all my

3463.119 --> 3467.44
flatter talks

3465.2 --> 3470.0
and a lot of the early bird shows at the

3467.44 --> 3471.599
beginning but it's just too much like i

3470.0 --> 3474.319
don't have the

3471.599 --> 3476.559
the patience

3474.319 --> 3479.68
to store all that [ __ ] i don't i barely

3476.559 --> 3479.6800000000003
have the oversight

3479.92 --> 3482.079
and

3483.04 --> 3487.04
but i have all my flat earth talks and i

3484.799 --> 3489.839
think that that is like probably the

3487.04 --> 3491.839
most important because that's where like

3489.839 --> 3493.52
the original seeds

3491.839 --> 3497.119
came from

3493.52 --> 3500.079
and it's so long ago and it's still so

3497.119 --> 3501.76
to the point it's incredible

3500.079 --> 3504.0
how relevant

3501.76 --> 3505.44
the flatter talks are to still

3504.0 --> 3509.04
everything that's

3505.44 --> 3509.04
that is being developed right now

3510.16 --> 3516.5589999999997
so yeah i got all those on my computer

3512.64 --> 3518.4
and on a dvd burned so even if you blow

3516.559 --> 3519.92
up my computer with some

3518.4 --> 3521.119
freaky secret

3519.92 --> 3524.96
[ __ ]

3521.119 --> 3524.96
i i will still have them

3526.4 --> 3531.839
anyway

3528.0 --> 3531.839
hello to what was all

3544.319 --> 3549.2
covet is a bio weapon victim what

3550.559 --> 3554.6400000000003
no no

3552.64 --> 3556.5589999999997
c

3554.64 --> 3557.68
is a condition

3556.559 --> 3561.119
it's

3557.68 --> 3563.44
part of our natural physique you're born

3561.119 --> 3566.48
with the elements that come afloat

3563.44 --> 3566.48
during that condition

3566.559 --> 3568.799
and

3569.2 --> 3573.839
that's what it is it's not even

3571.2 --> 3574.72
infectious it's not an infectious entity

3573.839 --> 3576.96
thing

3574.72 --> 3578.64
something that spreads on the wind

3576.96 --> 3580.96
nothing like that

3578.64 --> 3583.52
everybody has it in them

3580.96 --> 3585.44
always it's body inherent it's part of

3583.52 --> 3588.4
basically our

3585.44 --> 3588.4
metabolism

3589.68 --> 3596.24
and when you go through that it

3592.64 --> 3597.04
it's like a clean up process that's what

3596.24 --> 3598.5589999999997
the

3597.04 --> 3600.4
exosomes

3598.559 --> 3602.559
and even bacteria

3600.4 --> 3604.319
effectively do

3602.559 --> 3606.48
in your body

3604.319 --> 3611.119
because they are the cleaning crew

3606.48 --> 3614.2400000000002
your purge [ __ ] that's that's the sea

3611.119 --> 3616.079
it's a state you go into that transition

3614.24 --> 3617.359
a metabolic overall suddenly works

3616.079 --> 3619.6800000000003
differently you get

3617.359 --> 3622.0
byproduct side product in your body

3619.68 --> 3624.72
toxins being ex yeah

3622.0 --> 3628.48
exerted you get sick you get poisoned

3624.72 --> 3631.04
from that sort of and then

3628.48 --> 3634.799
these elements come about in your body

3631.04 --> 3639.119
to clean that up it's natural

3634.799 --> 3642.4
it's part of the biology itself

3639.119 --> 3645.28
right and you can't do anything to make

3642.4 --> 3648.2400000000002
that go away because you need it

3645.28 --> 3650.079
you need it to survive

3648.24 --> 3652.0789999999997
right

3650.079 --> 3653.2000000000003
it's like yeah what happens if you

3652.079 --> 3656.6400000000003
suddenly

3653.2 --> 3658.5589999999997
kill off all the garbage man garbage

3656.64 --> 3661.5989999999997
starts piling up

3658.559 --> 3663.599
it's gonna stink gonna rot and like wild

3661.599 --> 3665.92
animals are gonna tear them open and

3663.599 --> 3667.599
it's gonna be a hell

3665.92 --> 3669.119
everybody's gonna get sick from all the

3667.599 --> 3672.0
fumes and [ __ ]

3669.119 --> 3675.119
right well that's kind of what the v

3672.0 --> 3678.319
is doing it's actually

3675.119 --> 3680.799
in the pretense of being able to get rid

3678.319 --> 3684.0
of that mechanism and and every like

3680.799 --> 3686.24
what comes afloat during that process

3684.0 --> 3688.48
to make that stop to counter it or to

3686.24 --> 3690.16
replace it it actually

3688.48 --> 3693.04
completely

3690.16 --> 3695.5989999999997
makes it impossible for the garbage men

3693.04 --> 3697.599
to do their work

3695.599 --> 3699.599
it's like a bouncer in front of the

3697.599 --> 3700.7200000000003
building and they don't let the garbage

3699.599 --> 3703.04
man in

3700.72 --> 3705.359
so they could do their job so they can

3703.04 --> 3708.839
get to the trucks right that's what the

3705.359 --> 3708.839
v is doing

3717.76 --> 3722.7200000000003
how ironic right was it in new york

3721.92 --> 3724.319
where

3722.72 --> 3726.72
something like that is happening right

3724.319 --> 3731.0389999999998
now and like garbage is piling up there

3726.72 --> 3733.0389999999998
because some stupid mayor or something

3731.039 --> 3736.1600000000003
suddenly like forced them out to get

3733.039 --> 3738.88
fees isn't that just ironic

3736.16 --> 3741.5989999999997
terrible by the way i really hope that

3738.88 --> 3743.599
stops i don't want like everybody to get

3741.599 --> 3745.44
the plague over there because freaking

3743.599 --> 3747.2000000000003
garbage starts piling up but you can't

3745.44 --> 3748.7200000000003
force the garbage man to take that that

3747.2 --> 3751.5989999999997
is

3748.72 --> 3754.5589999999997
really brutal because garbage men

3751.599 --> 3756.88
need their immune system more than

3754.559 --> 3759.76
anybody they're constantly exposed to

3756.88 --> 3762.6400000000003
garbage and all kinds of weird [ __ ]

3759.76 --> 3765.92
they they you can't do it to them like

3762.64 --> 3765.92
they will perish

3766.4 --> 3769.839
and they probably know that

3781.52 --> 3783.839
anyway

3799.359 --> 3804.0789999999997
right ben white yeah well that that's

3801.359 --> 3807.119
effectively what is happening right so

3804.079 --> 3808.8390000000004
remember before

3807.119 --> 3811.839
you're

3808.839 --> 3812.72
2020 yeah you had the flu season and

3811.839 --> 3813.7599999999998
people

3812.72 --> 3815.5989999999997
did

3813.76 --> 3817.92
like

3815.599 --> 3819.6800000000003
because it got pretty serious and people

3817.92 --> 3821.6800000000003
went to the hospital

3819.68 --> 3823.5989999999997
for that sometimes

3821.68 --> 3826.72
they wouldn't get some creepy protocol

3823.599 --> 3828.96
to just kill them right so yeah then

3826.72 --> 3830.72
hospitals were kind of filled

3828.96 --> 3833.68
and then they got over it again and then

3830.72 --> 3836.9599999999996
flea flu season ends

3833.68 --> 3839.839
well now it's different

3836.96 --> 3839.839
because now

3840.72 --> 3844.64
people in yeah

3843.44 --> 3846.7200000000003
had the v

3844.64 --> 3848.64
and they get sick and then they get

3846.72 --> 3851.4399999999996
really sick and if they're unlucky

3848.64 --> 3853.2
they're gonna get the protocol and like

3851.44 --> 3854.319
die so

3853.2 --> 3856.64
yeah

3854.319 --> 3859.2799999999997
i'd prefer like the old flu season

3856.64 --> 3860.48
situation where people wouldn't just all

3859.28 --> 3862.799
die

3860.48 --> 3866.64
and go through horrible procedures and

3862.799 --> 3869.119
be slaughtered like that

3866.64 --> 3872.839
because that is of the v like it just

3869.119 --> 3872.839
adds up like that

3882.88 --> 3886.7200000000003
right because it doesn't stop you from

3885.039 --> 3890.0
getting it it just

3886.72 --> 3892.8799999999997
stops your immune system from being able

3890.0 --> 3895.76
to naturally deal with it

3892.88 --> 3898.48
that's what the v's do

3895.76 --> 3902.6400000000003
like their entire premise of the actions

3898.48 --> 3903.359
that they supposedly take on your body

3902.64 --> 3905.839
is

3903.359 --> 3908.0789999999997
based on misconception

3905.839 --> 3910.24
like yeah the model according to those

3908.079 --> 3912.319
presuppositions may mechanically work

3910.24 --> 3916.799
out like that

3912.319 --> 3916.799
but the entire premise is delusional

3917.359 --> 3922.64
and the end result in reality is

3920.319 --> 3926.16
devastating

3922.64 --> 3926.16
there's like syndromes now

3926.319 --> 3929.92
named after

3927.92 --> 3931.359
what typically happens to you like

3929.92 --> 3933.76
medical

3931.359 --> 3933.7599999999998
names

3934.48 --> 3937.359
i can't think of them at the top of my

3936.16 --> 3940.5589999999997
head but that's what happened that's

3937.359 --> 3940.5589999999997
what the v's do to you

3941.52 --> 3945.52
because the entire idea behind what

3944.319 --> 3947.92
they're supposed to do how they're

3945.52 --> 3949.44
supposed to manipulate you

3947.92 --> 3952.96
on a micro

3949.44 --> 3956.079
biological level to counter the

3952.96 --> 3957.44
infection is based on a faulty premise

3956.079 --> 3958.4
yes

3957.44 --> 3960.48
what

3958.4 --> 3962.2400000000002
it happens

3960.48 --> 3964.72
what is claimed in there

3962.24 --> 3966.319
it's just that there is no practical use

3964.72 --> 3970.24
for that because the entire thing is

3966.319 --> 3970.24
based on a false model premise

3971.359 --> 3973.52
and

3972.24 --> 3975.52
yeah

3973.52 --> 3978.079
i'm pretty sure that even like the

3975.52 --> 3980.72
designer of the technology has just flat

3978.079 --> 3983.119
out stated that

3980.72 --> 3987.1189999999997
like things get that crazy out there

3983.119 --> 3989.28
like the people that design these things

3987.119 --> 3990.6400000000003
i don't think they ever consciously

3989.28 --> 3993.44
meant

3990.64 --> 3995.7599999999998
all that technology to be applied like

3993.44 --> 3995.76
this

3999.28 --> 4003.52
it's almost like if they had truly known

4001.44 --> 4005.76
what would have been done with it they

4003.52 --> 4009.28
might have actually

4005.76 --> 4011.3590000000004
laid down the development work

4009.28 --> 4013.039
not sure about maybe maybe they did know

4011.359 --> 4014.96
and the money was they just didn't know

4013.039 --> 4017.76
how how to

4014.96 --> 4019.2
they just couldn't res they had to do it

4017.76 --> 4021.6800000000003
because of money reasons because they

4019.2 --> 4023.52
wanted things in life etc

4021.68 --> 4025.2799999999997
and now they're just like [ __ ] okay well

4023.52 --> 4028.079
we did it

4025.28 --> 4031.2000000000003
but now the freaking crazy people

4028.079 --> 4034.2000000000003
are abusing it for their eugenics plans

4031.2 --> 4034.2
[ __ ]

4052.4 --> 4057.359
if your immune system is destroyed you

4054.64 --> 4058.5589999999997
will get less infections

4057.359 --> 4061.359
well no

4058.559 --> 4064.799
it's just that your body will not

4061.359 --> 4067.2
noticeably respond it won't activate but

4064.799 --> 4068.799
that usually means that the infection is

4067.2 --> 4070.5589999999997
just going to reach

4068.799 --> 4072.4
to

4070.559 --> 4075.28
the danger zones

4072.4 --> 4077.28
and then potentially kill you like

4075.28 --> 4079.119
suddenly your organs just start failing

4077.28 --> 4082.1600000000003
or something that's what happens when

4079.119 --> 4084.559
your immune system doesn't work

4082.16 --> 4087.2799999999997
right oh i'm not getting the responses

4084.559 --> 4089.119
oh yeah it must be good no no actually

4087.28 --> 4090.88
that means they just went straight

4089.119 --> 4093.039
through the wall

4090.88 --> 4095.039
and they're now occupying the buildings

4093.039 --> 4096.319
inside and basically holding everybody

4095.039 --> 4098.4800000000005
in there hostage and they're going to

4096.319 --> 4101.839000000001
execute them all at some point

4098.48 --> 4104.08
oh there's no boom boom there's no

4101.839 --> 4105.839
because they just went through the wall

4104.08 --> 4107.92
they're inside now

4105.839 --> 4109.5199999999995
right it's silent that's not a good sign

4107.92 --> 4112.08
that means they're inside now they're

4109.52 --> 4115.040000000001
going to execute everybody right

4112.08 --> 4117.5199999999995
as a metaphor that's what that means you

4115.04 --> 4121.64
want your body to have the response that

4117.52 --> 4121.64
means the defense is working

4136.719 --> 4141.759
on the other hand if you're like really

4138.96 --> 4144.319
thriving you're like high

4141.759 --> 4146.799
strength focus energy like your body is

4144.319 --> 4149.92
in optimal condition then

4146.799 --> 4152.48
a non-response might simply mean that

4149.92 --> 4155.679
there is no cleanup necessary because

4152.48 --> 4158.4
everything is just perfect and then

4155.679 --> 4160.4
no infection happens at all there is

4158.4 --> 4161.3589999999995
just no infection

4160.4 --> 4164.3189999999995
right

4161.359 --> 4167.64
but if you're not like that

4164.319 --> 4167.64
you have destabilizations

4167.679 --> 4171.279
you're off your system is off it's

4169.679 --> 4172.96
damaged somehow

4171.279 --> 4175.52
or the hormones are wrong there's

4172.96 --> 4176.719
something wrong then if you don't get

4175.52 --> 4178.159000000001
any

4176.719 --> 4181.12
kind of sign

4178.159 --> 4181.12
then it's dangerous

4181.6 --> 4185.88
it yeah it gets a little complicated

4188.48 --> 4191.3589999999995
right but

4189.44 --> 4193.12
to know the difference also means

4191.359 --> 4196.08
because if you're in optimal conditions

4193.12 --> 4198.64
that effectively also typically means

4196.08 --> 4201.199
that wounds will heal quicker

4198.64 --> 4203.84
you have less scarring right

4201.199 --> 4207.36
so that's why yeah infections during

4203.84 --> 4210.0
wounds you get a wound it's serious

4207.36 --> 4213.599999999999
and then it doesn't heal up properly

4210.0 --> 4213.6
now you know you got a problem

4213.84 --> 4216.8
right

4214.64 --> 4219.280000000001
that means trouble

4216.8 --> 4221.360000000001
that means your system's not handling

4219.28 --> 4223.679
it's not healing up that means it's not

4221.36 --> 4224.719
getting to that phase where it can do

4223.679 --> 4227.12
that

4224.719 --> 4228.4
that means

4227.12 --> 4231.04
potential

4228.4 --> 4233.12
infection risks and like if that carries

4231.04 --> 4234.64
on then you even get gangrene in that

4233.12 --> 4236.08
sort of horror

4234.64 --> 4238.56
right

4236.08 --> 4242.159
like open wounds that don't heal

4238.56 --> 4245.280000000001
gangrene you're [ __ ]

4242.159 --> 4247.28
unless you got a lot of silver something

4245.28 --> 4248.96
and then even still it's super risky

4247.28 --> 4252.639999999999
dude people

4248.96 --> 4254.8
like in old wars had like limbs

4252.64 --> 4258.04
sawed off because of [ __ ] gangrene

4254.8 --> 4258.04
it's horrific

4260.719 --> 4264.4800000000005
ugh

4262.8 --> 4268.28
anyway let's not talk about that too

4264.48 --> 4268.28
much it's disgusting

4272.719 --> 4277.6
what's the best type of physical

4274.719 --> 4277.6
exercise

4282.159 --> 4284.4
that

4284.8 --> 4288.96
yeah

4286.719 --> 4288.96
well

4289.36 --> 4294.5599999999995
i'm not really like physical exercise

4291.84 --> 4297.76
routine kind of guy

4294.56 --> 4299.120000000001
but what i do is whenever i just do

4297.76 --> 4301.76
something

4299.12 --> 4305.04
i never like slander i never like oh i

4301.76 --> 4305.04
don't wanna for me

4305.36 --> 4310.0
focus

4307.36 --> 4315.04
and like discipline in maintaining your

4310.0 --> 4316.96
motivations is the most important part

4315.04 --> 4318.48
because if you're just i don't want it

4316.96 --> 4320.719
but i'm going to do it because of the

4318.48 --> 4321.44
routine then what's it going to do to

4320.719 --> 4322.96
you

4321.44 --> 4324.639999999999
like when you do something that you

4322.96 --> 4327.199
really don't want that's actually kind

4324.64 --> 4329.679
of strainful in your system

4327.199 --> 4331.839999999999
but what i do is just okay

4329.679 --> 4334.08
i have to constantly walk well not

4331.84 --> 4335.6
constantly but daily walk

4334.08 --> 4337.76
up and down

4335.6 --> 4340.56
a flight of stairs

4337.76 --> 4342.4800000000005
so whenever i do i do it energetically

4340.56 --> 4344.719
never like oh my god i don't want to

4342.48 --> 4347.12
walk up these stairs

4344.719 --> 4349.92
i never allow myself to get like that i

4347.12 --> 4351.84
just like no just do it like

4349.92 --> 4353.52
almost fantasize like it's part of a

4351.84 --> 4355.4400000000005
military training or something right

4353.52 --> 4356.719
it's like just take it serious take the

4355.44 --> 4358.799999999999
challenge

4356.719 --> 4361.679
i kind of blow it up in my mind a little

4358.8 --> 4364.0
to just make it into a sort of a sports

4361.679 --> 4366.719
situation for myself and the same thing

4364.0 --> 4368.84
goes for when i go out on my bike

4366.719 --> 4370.88
to get groceries

4368.84 --> 4373.04
typically i

4370.88 --> 4374.2390000000005
i make it almost like into a racing

4373.04 --> 4376.0
circuit

4374.239 --> 4378.718999999999
like

4376.0 --> 4381.04
how can i like

4378.719 --> 4382.64
time things perfectly pay a lot of

4381.04 --> 4385.5199999999995
attention to the traffic around just the

4382.64 --> 4388.2390000000005
dynamics of how things flow i really get

4385.52 --> 4390.400000000001
into like higher mindset

4388.239 --> 4390.4
to

4391.12 --> 4396.0
on an intuitive level explore my

4392.88 --> 4398.56
surroundings so i can almost do like the

4396.0 --> 4400.719
the indian big city thing

4398.56 --> 4402.96
where you can just

4400.719 --> 4405.28
have you ever seen like traffic

4402.96 --> 4408.2390000000005
locations in india where it's really

4405.28 --> 4410.48
crowded it's crazy it's crazy and it's

4408.239 --> 4413.44
amazing that it's not just a giant

4410.48 --> 4416.159
pileup of cars and bikes and [ __ ]

4413.44 --> 4418.0
in an accident that almost never happens

4416.159 --> 4420.639999999999
because they're in the flow and i try to

4418.0 --> 4422.08
do that thing so i can literally slip

4420.64 --> 4424.2390000000005
through everything without any

4422.08 --> 4426.719
obstruction without any problems

4424.239 --> 4428.32
to cause anybody and so again i put

4426.719 --> 4429.92
energy into it

4428.32 --> 4432.4
and i put paste into it and they were

4429.92 --> 4434.2390000000005
like oh i don't want it but i gotta get

4432.4 --> 4437.679
there no it's like no

4434.239 --> 4439.12
you just put energy in it you just do it

4437.679 --> 4441.36
that works

4439.12 --> 4444.48
that works for me really well because of

4441.36 --> 4446.96
that i'm decently fit

4444.48 --> 4449.599999999999
i never like really grind to a halt

4446.96 --> 4449.6
physically

4450.08 --> 4453.5199999999995
and

4451.679 --> 4455.679
keeps me going

4453.52 --> 4458.56
so just do something

4455.679 --> 4461.28
active so whatever whatever it is you

4458.56 --> 4463.1990000000005
can do your daily activities

4461.28 --> 4465.12
more actively

4463.199 --> 4467.199
or you could i don't know

4465.12 --> 4469.36
find the sport

4467.199 --> 4471.36
or maybe you like doing push-ups or

4469.36 --> 4473.92
something or you like dealing with

4471.36 --> 4475.44
weights and sometimes it comes and goes

4473.92 --> 4477.4400000000005
sometimes you're just like oh now i want

4475.44 --> 4479.919999999999
to do weights like i typically have that

4477.44 --> 4481.678999999999
during springtime then i get like i want

4479.92 --> 4483.4400000000005
to do weights

4481.679 --> 4485.28
it helps during the springtime but the

4483.44 --> 4487.839999999999
rest of the year is like no

4485.28 --> 4487.84
not really

4491.04 --> 4495.04
right so just

4492.96 --> 4497.44
whatever works for you

4495.04 --> 4499.04
but you gotta look you gotta kind of

4497.44 --> 4502.0
figure out just

4499.04 --> 4502.0
try things out

4508.32 --> 4514.239
do i ever swim

4510.64 --> 4514.2390000000005
i used to a lot

4514.88 --> 4517.12
but

4518.239 --> 4522.4
i don't do that anymore too much also

4520.48 --> 4525.839999999999
because yeah all pools

4522.4 --> 4525.839999999999
have like chlorine in them

4526.48 --> 4531.759999999999
and i don't like that i don't like the

4529.28 --> 4533.84
smell of it it

4531.76 --> 4535.679
i mean as a kid it didn't really bother

4533.84 --> 4538.679
me too much

4535.679 --> 4538.679
but

4539.679 --> 4544.88
it's just i feel kind of weird afterward

4542.32 --> 4546.4
every time now

4544.88 --> 4550.159000000001
well the last time i've even been in the

4546.4 --> 4550.159
pool was like over 10 years ago

4550.56 --> 4557.76
but even then it kind of felt weird

4553.199 --> 4557.759999999999
i do really like salt water though

4560.56 --> 4564.88
so yeah

4562.64 --> 4566.400000000001
if i ever get to like oceans in the

4564.88 --> 4568.4800000000005
summer

4566.4 --> 4572.5599999999995
a nice beach yeah i'd love to go in

4568.48 --> 4576.239
there as long as there's no jellyfish

4572.56 --> 4576.2390000000005
and uh it's not too cold

4576.719 --> 4581.52
and there's like salt water pools

4578.8 --> 4583.6
sometimes that's awesome like that is

4581.52 --> 4586.080000000001
actually good for my skin

4583.6 --> 4588.400000000001
that makes me feel better afterward

4586.08 --> 4591.04
but there's not a lot of those

4588.4 --> 4593.28
if they go like spas and such they have

4591.04 --> 4595.84
salt water pools usually

4593.28 --> 4595.84
anyway

4596.0 --> 4599.12
but yeah swimming

4599.52 --> 4604.080000000001
it usually comes down to full body

4602.0 --> 4606.0
exercise

4604.08 --> 4608.08
you not near the sea

4606.0 --> 4611.76
well maybe by american standards i'm

4608.08 --> 4611.76
pretty close to the sea but no

4611.92 --> 4615.6
the beach is not right next door

4620.88 --> 4627.52
and besides the dutch sea is

4624.8 --> 4631.4400000000005
it's always freaking cold

4627.52 --> 4631.4400000000005
and there's like a lot of dirty foam

4635.199 --> 4640.96
i don't know i'm not too much of a fan

4637.92 --> 4642.88
of the the dutch sea

4640.96 --> 4646.56
i like like the uh

4642.88 --> 4649.52
mediterranean sea a lot more

4646.56 --> 4652.4800000000005
for good memories of going to spain

4649.52 --> 4656.320000000001
at the east coast and then in the summer

4652.48 --> 4656.32
in the sea there that's like a delight

4659.84 --> 4665.360000000001
england is satanic oh subtle aries it's

4663.04 --> 4667.58
not over generalization at all

4665.36 --> 4670.63
at all

4667.58 --> 4670.63
[Music]

4670.96 --> 4676.52
like how

4672.64 --> 4676.52
what does that even mean

4684.08 --> 4688.239
the phone comes from english toilets

4686.239 --> 4690.0
maybe gadget inspector but it probably

4688.239 --> 4690.799999999999
also comes from

4690.0 --> 4692.48
just

4690.8 --> 4693.679
the dutch

4692.48 --> 4695.678999999999
stuff

4693.679 --> 4697.28
rivers

4695.679 --> 4699.92
garbage from the rivers and by the way

4697.28 --> 4702.0
those rivers some of them

4699.92 --> 4706.4400000000005
go through a whole bunch of regions like

4702.0 --> 4706.44
from germany and from france

4708.719 --> 4713.52
i'm just like the coast and being at the

4711.28 --> 4715.44
coast in the netherlands can be

4713.52 --> 4719.8
interesting and refreshing

4715.44 --> 4719.799999999999
but like swimming in the ocean

4722.32 --> 4726.799999999999
not big fan of that i mean i'm not

4724.88 --> 4730.08
saying that i'll never do it or i'm

4726.8 --> 4732.56
scared of it i have gone into the ocean

4730.08 --> 4735.84
last time's been like

4732.56 --> 4735.84
15 years ago

4737.28 --> 4742.36
but

4738.159 --> 4742.36
not a big fan of that there

4751.76 --> 4756.2390000000005
oh english royalty oh yeah yeah

4758.48 --> 4763.839999999999
right but that's not the country though

4760.96 --> 4763.84
you know

4769.44 --> 4774.48
you don't want to swallow see what ee

4772.32 --> 4777.48
no no i don't even want to think about

4774.48 --> 4777.48
that

4810.88 --> 4813.88
so

4820.88 --> 4823.88
right

4833.84 --> 4838.4800000000005
training in the velodrome to improve

4836.0 --> 4840.48
grocery time no

4838.48 --> 4843.199
no way old

4840.48 --> 4845.12
it's not necessary my entire route is

4843.199 --> 4848.08
already optimized

4845.12 --> 4850.0
and when i got extra energy then i go

4848.08 --> 4850.96
really fast

4850.0 --> 4852.96
and

4850.96 --> 4855.04
but i always make sure to just have a

4852.96 --> 4856.88
minimum pace

4855.04 --> 4858.8
which is always faster than everybody

4856.88 --> 4863.4400000000005
else

4858.8 --> 4863.4400000000005
except maybe like sporty sprinters

4863.52 --> 4867.92
i i don't like like those

4866.239 --> 4872.44
fake bikes

4867.92 --> 4872.4400000000005
i i don't like those things

4892.239 --> 4895.239
what

4902.239 --> 4905.678999999999
cvs

4903.679 --> 4909.639
no you're being

4905.679 --> 4909.639
delusional right now

4925.679 --> 4928.679
so

4944.8 --> 4947.92
no

4946.0 --> 4950.08
this ridiculous statement you can't

4947.92 --> 4951.84
seriously believe that

4950.08 --> 4954.0
maybe you're afraid and you feel

4951.84 --> 4956.8
obligated to say that

4954.0 --> 4959.6
the queen worships jesus

4956.8 --> 4963.28
there's no way

4959.6 --> 4965.280000000001
i mean she'll use him

4963.28 --> 4967.759999999999
as a cover

4965.28 --> 4973.32
i don't think that the queen of england

4967.76 --> 4973.320000000001
worships anything else besides power

5001.6 --> 5005.76
dude

5002.639 --> 5007.36
hello cps what freaking world do you

5005.76 --> 5010.400000000001
live in man

5007.36 --> 5012.4
like dude you're you're like in your 50s

5010.4 --> 5014.159
right this is idiotic you can't

5012.4 --> 5016.239
seriously be saying this are you

5014.159 --> 5018.638999999999
demented

5016.239 --> 5020.879999999999
the queen has no power in the uk alright

5018.639 --> 5023.4400000000005
do you know what freaking world you're

5020.88 --> 5023.4400000000005
living in

5023.92 --> 5026.96
like she has

5025.76 --> 5029.04
basically

5026.96 --> 5033.679
full monarch powers

5029.04 --> 5036.48
she could do anything at a whim anything

5033.679 --> 5038.2390000000005
no limits

5036.48 --> 5040.879999999999
i think she's potentially can even

5038.239 --> 5042.879999999999
legally just murder somebody in plain

5040.88 --> 5044.0
sight

5042.88 --> 5045.76
although that

5044.0 --> 5047.76
would of course everything she does does

5045.76 --> 5050.320000000001
have consequences

5047.76 --> 5052.56
popularity consequences mostly all that

5050.32 --> 5055.5599999999995
but no you'd be surprised how

5052.56 --> 5055.56
unbelievably

5056.0 --> 5060.0
power what how much power she legally

5059.12 --> 5063.199
has

5060.0 --> 5063.199
you're so wrong

5066.88 --> 5072.32
she doesn't run the con oh is that power

5069.36 --> 5072.32
running the country

5076.159 --> 5081.839999999999
dude she can literally fire the entire

5078.8 --> 5084.0
cabinet at a whim and just assign

5081.84 --> 5086.159000000001
replacements

5084.0 --> 5087.679
you think that's

5086.159 --> 5090.679
hello

5087.679 --> 5090.679
hello

5100.08 --> 5104.8
no she can't that is wrong you're

5102.0 --> 5111.28
[ __ ] cbs

5104.8 --> 5111.28
yes she can and she has she freaking ass

5111.76 --> 5114.96
are you demented

5116.0 --> 5120.88
legal power and she uses it yes

5120.0 --> 5123.04
when

5120.88 --> 5125.4400000000005
what was it was it like 10 years ago or

5123.04 --> 5125.44
something

5125.6 --> 5130.56
i mean it's not super rare or even it's

5129.52 --> 5133.76
dude

5130.56 --> 5134.8
the queen even just has legal monarch

5133.76 --> 5137.1990000000005
powers

5134.8 --> 5138.96
over freaking canada and australia and

5137.199 --> 5140.96
all that

5138.96 --> 5145.76
it's complicated

5140.96 --> 5145.76
it's very complicated but she does

5150.32 --> 5153.96
didn't she like

5154.8 --> 5160.320000000001
like legally veto

5157.36 --> 5163.92
a president or something in

5160.32 --> 5166.5599999999995
in canada like 10 years ago

5163.92 --> 5168.88
i remember there was an item back then

5166.56 --> 5171.76
like that's crazy like how can she just

5168.88 --> 5174.32
negate elections in another country well

5171.76 --> 5177.56
she can

5174.32 --> 5177.5599999999995
it's crazy

5192.48 --> 5196.879999999999
i can't believe you don't know this [ __ ]

5194.239 --> 5199.44
you should know that

5196.88 --> 5201.679
like don't mess

5199.44 --> 5203.199
don't don't mess with that it's

5201.679 --> 5204.8
dangerous

5203.199 --> 5206.879999999999
like unless you really know what you're

5204.8 --> 5211.2390000000005
doing unless you

5206.88 --> 5211.2390000000005
well yeah really know what you're doing

5263.76 --> 5267.76
oh the queen can feature on behalf of

5266.0 --> 5272.36
the government oh you mean the

5267.76 --> 5272.360000000001
government that she assigns

5285.04 --> 5289.44
hey cps

5287.04 --> 5290.719
can you do some historical digging for

5289.44 --> 5293.04
me right

5290.719 --> 5294.88
try to find a moment in the history of

5293.04 --> 5296.159
england

5294.88 --> 5297.76
where

5296.159 --> 5299.759999999999
the parliament

5297.76 --> 5300.56
any parliament

5299.76 --> 5301.92
could

5300.56 --> 5305.52
veto

5301.92 --> 5307.12
a decision the queen made about anything

5305.52 --> 5310.159000000001
like veto it

5307.12 --> 5311.599999999999
not get hurt to like

5310.159 --> 5313.679
give it up

5311.6 --> 5316.400000000001
and work along

5313.679 --> 5317.6
right not like

5316.4 --> 5319.599999999999
no queen

5317.6 --> 5322.56
i know you're insisting on doing this

5319.6 --> 5325.120000000001
right now but you're not allowed

5322.56 --> 5328.320000000001
the government has decided

5325.12 --> 5332.4
show me a single

5328.32 --> 5332.4
example in history where that happened

5333.6 --> 5336.76
all right

5339.6 --> 5344.400000000001
the netherlands is also more yeah

5342.159 --> 5347.04
dude i don't know exactly how it the

5344.4 --> 5351.239
netherlands is not this it's not

5347.04 --> 5351.239
exactly the same

5352.159 --> 5354.48
it's

5354.96 --> 5359.199
i i

5357.04 --> 5363.0
i don't know exactly how it works

5359.199 --> 5363.0
it's not like that

5366.08 --> 5369.08
so

5385.52 --> 5388.88
all right

5386.88 --> 5390.88
defending the queen in internet chats

5388.88 --> 5392.719
but i don't even understand am i

5390.88 --> 5395.36
attacking her

5392.719 --> 5398.639
am i saying yeah this is wrong no i'm

5395.36 --> 5401.36
just trying to point out how i see

5398.639 --> 5405.4800000000005
how i've conceived that it works

5401.36 --> 5405.48
i'm not attacking the queen

5406.0 --> 5410.96
i'm not gonna say oh she's all perfect

5408.08 --> 5413.36
but i'm not attacking

5410.96 --> 5414.719
i'm just trying to point out how things

5413.36 --> 5418.12
really are

5414.719 --> 5418.12
that's it

5433.28 --> 5436.48
wrong oh really

5439.44 --> 5446.44
i'm getting inspector i would like to

5441.36 --> 5446.44
know historical examples about that

5449.44 --> 5453.12
i've

5450.8 --> 5455.28
on the top of my mind i can't think of

5453.12 --> 5457.84
details but i think that's probably

5455.28 --> 5460.48
happened a few times yeah

5457.84 --> 5463.4800000000005
cps watch the royals on netflix maybe he

5460.48 --> 5463.48
has

5465.36 --> 5470.4
it's inbred no come on no there's no

5468.159 --> 5473.839999999999
need

5470.4 --> 5475.679
this is not about her character

5473.84 --> 5477.1990000000005
this is about legal

5475.679 --> 5480.56
power

5477.199 --> 5480.5599999999995
and getting real with it

5480.639 --> 5484.52
like what is going on

5505.12 --> 5511.199
well there you go george sandra thank

5506.88 --> 5513.04
you for reminding us yeah that's right

5511.199 --> 5516.638999999999
and

5513.04 --> 5516.639
that's not ceremonial

5517.199 --> 5522.32
right that's not a ceremony people may

5520.159 --> 5526.0
feel like it's a ceremony but it's not

5522.32 --> 5527.29
actually a ceremony it's a critical

5526.0 --> 5529.6
legal approval

5527.29 --> 5531.679
[Laughter]

5529.6 --> 5532.719
because she has power

5531.679 --> 5536.04
legally

5532.719 --> 5536.04
it's real

5552.56 --> 5560.04
the key word is must oh my god

5556.639 --> 5560.04
this is pathetic

5568.0 --> 5575.76
yeah must yeah yeah yeah must in this

5571.28 --> 5578.96
case means legal obligation not

5575.76 --> 5580.320000000001
uh the queen must do it

5578.96 --> 5582.8
as in

5580.32 --> 5586.719
others are obligating her no it's like a

5582.8 --> 5588.96
legal necessity that's what that means

5586.719 --> 5592.159
and legal necessity means

5588.96 --> 5594.159
the person doing that is a key factor in

5592.159 --> 5596.159
the procedures and that means that if

5594.159 --> 5599.759999999999
they don't do it

5596.159 --> 5599.759999999999
it becomes nullified

5610.32 --> 5613.44
if people went against the government

5612.08 --> 5614.88
the people would start

5613.44 --> 5616.799999999999
well yes

5614.88 --> 5618.96
yes

5616.8 --> 5621.28
that is potentially possible that's why

5618.96 --> 5623.92
i said like yeah technically she can get

5621.28 --> 5626.239
away with idiot crazy things

5623.92 --> 5627.6
monstrous things but

5626.239 --> 5631.28
yeah if

5627.6 --> 5633.6
the people are just too fed up

5631.28 --> 5635.04
like if that completely breaks the

5633.6 --> 5636.400000000001
spirit

5635.04 --> 5638.96
of the people

5636.4 --> 5640.32
then yeah she also risks

5638.96 --> 5643.04
a revolt

5640.32 --> 5644.5599999999995
right that's oh that is the true

5643.04 --> 5646.88
counterweight

5644.56 --> 5648.88
but yeah at the same time she has

5646.88 --> 5650.32
people are just completely mind

5648.88 --> 5652.88
controlled to

5650.32 --> 5654.5599999999995
pacified and all that

5652.88 --> 5655.92
so

5654.56 --> 5658.8
but it is

5655.92 --> 5661.4400000000005
tech like if she could technically

5658.8 --> 5664.719
mechanically go too far and even snap

5661.44 --> 5666.0
them out of that level of mind control

5664.719 --> 5668.719
like

5666.0 --> 5670.96
let's just say something that

5668.719 --> 5673.44
pretty good that never happens but let's

5670.96 --> 5676.639
just say like the queen one day just

5673.44 --> 5679.5199999999995
completely goes ape [ __ ]

5676.639 --> 5682.08
takes like a sword and starts hacking

5679.52 --> 5684.2390000000005
off people in the street

5682.08 --> 5685.44
like completely berserk

5684.239 --> 5687.839999999999
just like

5685.44 --> 5692.48
kill like 50 people

5687.84 --> 5693.360000000001
or like even the crazy situation right

5692.48 --> 5696.08
yeah

5693.36 --> 5697.5199999999995
that's gonna break the spirit so bad and

5696.08 --> 5700.159
she's gonna be declared insane

5697.52 --> 5703.679
everybody's gonna be like yeah that is

5700.159 --> 5706.0
that is out of control it's over now

5703.679 --> 5706.0
right

5706.88 --> 5714.52
and that would then

5709.199 --> 5714.5199999999995
basically get her dethroned for sure

5714.56 --> 5720.8
but the legal mechanism

5717.92 --> 5722.2390000000005
is purely dependent on that collective

5720.8 --> 5725.52
counter

5722.239 --> 5728.32
of like everybody that would have to be

5725.52 --> 5731.92
non-divided and unified under that

5728.32 --> 5733.92
counter or it wouldn't work

5731.92 --> 5736.159
it's complicated

5733.92 --> 5736.159
right

5739.119 --> 5745.759999999999
but legally yeah the queen can legally

5742.08 --> 5745.76
just get away with almost anything

5746.56 --> 5751.6
but yeah it the the populace will be the

5750.0 --> 5754.08
counterweight in that

5751.6 --> 5755.84
as far as they can

5754.08 --> 5758.159
remain

5755.84 --> 5762.4800000000005
undivided

5758.159 --> 5762.48
when when such moments come to pass

5762.8 --> 5768.76
anyway

5764.96 --> 5768.76
i'll be back in two minutes

5780.8 --> 5783.8
me

5855.92 --> 5858.92
ugh

5868.88 --> 5874.639
dude don't bring up my swords after what

5871.44 --> 5876.96
i just said that's terrible

5874.639 --> 5876.96
uh

5878.0 --> 5881.4
but yeah

5891.76 --> 5896.96
i was trying just trying to give it like

5893.92 --> 5898.639
a really over-the-top outrageous

5896.96 --> 5900.8
situation

5898.639 --> 5902.88
which you can halfway visualize in your

5900.8 --> 5904.88
mind probably because of hollywood

5902.88 --> 5906.400000000001
movies and all that

5904.88 --> 5908.4800000000005
right

5906.4 --> 5910.48
but yeah would be ridiculous if anything

5908.48 --> 5914.48
like that ever happened like she would

5910.48 --> 5914.48
have to be like on some freaky

5914.76 --> 5920.639
megalomaniacal bloodthirsty drug like

5918.32 --> 5923.04
let's just say an overdose on

5920.639 --> 5925.4400000000005
adrenachrome or something ridiculous

5923.04 --> 5927.44
like that i don't even know if it does

5925.44 --> 5929.839999999999
that but

5927.44 --> 5929.839999999999
whatever

5930.88 --> 5934.8
i'm prepared for zombie apocalypse

5946.96 --> 5951.44
i'll just use my turn undead priestly

5950.239 --> 5954.32
ability

5951.44 --> 5954.32
if it comes to that

5959.28 --> 5967.84
just say a few words to make them snap

5963.119 --> 5967.839999999999
in on themselves and they just die

5974.4 --> 5979.5599999999995
like zombies are very vulnerable guys

5985.92 --> 5992.119
that's right turning that the dnd

5988.159 --> 5992.119
ability that's right

6006.4 --> 6009.4
ah

6012.719 --> 6017.8
hey if galatero can do it so can i

6036.88 --> 6042.8
do i believe in ghosts

6040.8 --> 6045.04
believe

6042.8 --> 6047.92
that depends on what the belief about

6045.04 --> 6049.76
them are i know what ghosts are i know

6047.92 --> 6052.2390000000005
all the different forms in which

6049.76 --> 6055.52
apparitions and spirits can manifest and

6052.239 --> 6055.5199999999995
be experienced yeah

6056.32 --> 6060.32
it's not a matter of belief it's not a

6058.239 --> 6062.5599999999995
rumor that i heard that i believe in

6060.32 --> 6065.84
i've literally witnessed things

6062.56 --> 6065.84
on different levels i've done

6066.0 --> 6073.04
explorations i've done personal

6069.119 --> 6077.28
research i've witnessed freaky things

6073.04 --> 6077.28
i've studied creepy things

6077.36 --> 6081.0
like 20 years ago a lot

6079.84 --> 6083.6
i've

6081.0 --> 6087.84
exercised people

6083.6 --> 6087.84
i've exercised houses

6088.0 --> 6090.32
yeah

6090.719 --> 6095.159
i was really into that back then

6109.04 --> 6113.5199999999995
gotta be a shotgun or chainsaw you

6114.88 --> 6122.08
chainsaws are so [ __ ] messy dude like

6119.52 --> 6125.040000000001
chainsaw i wouldn't use that

6122.08 --> 6126.0
like you're gonna be like

6125.04 --> 6129.639
just

6126.0 --> 6129.639
covered in gore

6134.32 --> 6139.84
i think like a a good sharp katana

6136.719 --> 6142.96
against now like movie zombies would be

6139.84 --> 6142.96
much more effective

6144.0 --> 6149.32
because then you don't get all covered

6146.0 --> 6149.32
in goo

6157.199 --> 6160.719
and you don't run out of ammo

6161.6 --> 6165.2390000000005
you don't have to reload

6182.48 --> 6186.08
how did we get to this subject that's

6184.4 --> 6189.08
just crazy

6186.08 --> 6189.08
uh

6192.56 --> 6196.639
was there any follow-up to that steamy

6194.32 --> 6198.96
traveler was there anything specific

6196.639 --> 6200.88
you wanted me to address i mean i've

6198.96 --> 6202.88
talked about those types of things for a

6200.88 --> 6205.36
while you know the

6202.88 --> 6208.96
ghost of my mother that i saw before she

6205.36 --> 6208.96
before i knew she had died and

6211.679 --> 6215.679
and hey especially when i'm really

6213.76 --> 6219.280000000001
restless

6215.679 --> 6221.679
like weird things happen

6219.28 --> 6223.92
i've had a lot of like nighttime weird

6221.679 --> 6226.4
experiences where just

6223.92 --> 6228.8
it's like entities just start

6226.4 --> 6231.799999999999
trying to manifest and all that in my

6228.8 --> 6231.8
vicinity

6245.92 --> 6249.84
also i believe that

6248.159 --> 6252.08
the sightings

6249.84 --> 6254.08
this is now the

6252.08 --> 6256.8
even the early research community and

6254.08 --> 6259.76
the ghosts and apparitions like ooh

6256.8 --> 6262.159000000001
orbs orbs yeah i think that orbs are

6259.76 --> 6262.159000000001
actually

6262.88 --> 6268.8
pure energy life forms

6266.32 --> 6271.84
i think that they are like micro spirits

6268.8 --> 6275.04
i think that some of them might even be

6271.84 --> 6277.6
astral travelers in some way but then

6275.04 --> 6278.96
yeah they're not just gonna float around

6277.6 --> 6280.0
but like

6278.96 --> 6281.84
spirit

6280.0 --> 6283.52
entities that have pure energy

6281.84 --> 6286.400000000001
manifestation

6283.52 --> 6287.679
and they are attracted to like certain

6286.4 --> 6290.4
types of energy and that's where you

6287.679 --> 6292.08
start to spot them more and more

6290.4 --> 6293.0
in relation to other locations that have

6292.08 --> 6295.28
been like

6293.0 --> 6296.719
electromagnetically neutralized

6295.28 --> 6298.32
depolarized

6296.719 --> 6300.719
right

6298.32 --> 6303.719
so but i think that they are like

6300.719 --> 6305.679
amoeba they're like cellular

6303.719 --> 6307.52
microorganisms that are actually much

6305.679 --> 6310.0
bigger

6307.52 --> 6311.360000000001
but they're not cells they're just

6310.0 --> 6313.04
like

6311.36 --> 6313.759999999999
like a cell

6313.04 --> 6315.44
but

6313.76 --> 6317.6
energy

6315.44 --> 6319.36
it's weird

6317.6 --> 6321.92
right so

6319.36 --> 6321.92
there's that

6323.36 --> 6327.5199999999995
rods there's rods but i'm not even like

6326.0 --> 6328.96
sure what that is

6327.52 --> 6330.639
like

6328.96 --> 6332.96
those tubes

6330.639 --> 6335.28
there's that that's that's a really odd

6332.96 --> 6336.8
one i don't know what that is

6335.28 --> 6338.48
i don't know for sure i think that

6336.8 --> 6341.119000000001
sometimes that it's something extra

6338.48 --> 6341.119
dimensional

6341.76 --> 6348.4800000000005
it doesn't seem like a life form

6346.08 --> 6351.119
like the orbs do

6348.48 --> 6353.119
it doesn't seem like cellular

6351.119 --> 6354.88
natural spirit life it seems like

6353.119 --> 6356.48
something i don't know what they are

6354.88 --> 6358.56
it's weird

6356.48 --> 6360.32
i don't know why they sometimes start to

6358.56 --> 6362.56
show up

6360.32 --> 6366.0
i don't know what they are

6362.56 --> 6368.639
but they don't feel like a organism like

6366.0 --> 6368.639
orbs do

6370.719 --> 6377.119
but maybe i'm wrong maybe they are like

6373.36 --> 6377.119
another form of spiritual

6377.76 --> 6382.719
entity like more like insectoid or

6380.32 --> 6382.719
something

6385.119 --> 6389.599999999999
dude

6386.48 --> 6391.199
i think that life exists beyond physical

6389.6 --> 6393.280000000001
matter

6391.199 --> 6395.678999999999
i think there are literally energy life

6393.28 --> 6398.719
forms that are just energy

6395.679 --> 6402.56
and that have cohesion

6398.719 --> 6404.8
despite not having a physical

6402.56 --> 6407.6
body like they don't have a physical

6404.8 --> 6411.119000000001
throne but they are like their own

6407.6 --> 6411.119000000001
energy naturally forming

6411.679 --> 6414.679
anyway

6426.56 --> 6432.159000000001
right yeah the camera

6429.76 --> 6435.280000000001
like the ghosts of dead people doing

6432.159 --> 6436.96
[ __ ] with like on camera that stuff is

6435.28 --> 6440.4
weird man

6436.96 --> 6440.4
but i think that that is

6440.84 --> 6446.0
also

6442.48 --> 6448.5599999999995
some of them potentially real

6446.0 --> 6449.76
but they are like spirits of the dead

6448.56 --> 6452.639
that then

6449.76 --> 6454.88
manifest either in an echo and then it

6452.639 --> 6458.32
would probably be

6454.88 --> 6460.88
location bound it's like an echo an echo

6458.32 --> 6463.199
of a person they have

6460.88 --> 6464.56
engrained their being

6463.199 --> 6466.48
during life

6464.56 --> 6468.4800000000005
there in some way

6466.48 --> 6470.718999999999
or maybe they never even physically were

6468.48 --> 6472.718999999999
there but they just had the the place in

6470.719 --> 6475.28
their mind engrained connected for some

6472.719 --> 6477.76
reason they their energy ties in with

6475.28 --> 6480.719
that and then after they die

6477.76 --> 6484.88
an echo of their spirit manifestation

6480.719 --> 6486.88
keeps returning there like a movie tape

6484.88 --> 6488.8
getting played over and over again i

6486.88 --> 6489.84
think that this is pretty accurately

6488.8 --> 6492.08
even

6489.84 --> 6495.04
displayed like in movies about that sort

6492.08 --> 6496.0
of thing scythe like spooky movies

6495.04 --> 6499.199
because

6496.0 --> 6503.44
that's kind of like how it works

6499.199 --> 6503.44
like and i've seen those type of things

6503.92 --> 6508.88
it does seem though that like the the

6506.48 --> 6512.0
manifestation of them typically is

6508.88 --> 6513.92
accompanied by the drawing in of outside

6512.0 --> 6515.44
energy so if you're in the presence of

6513.92 --> 6517.52
something like that happen you're

6515.44 --> 6520.638999999999
probably going to feel it like something

6517.52 --> 6523.040000000001
is sucking a bit of your energy

6520.639 --> 6524.8
you might feel suddenly like really cold

6523.04 --> 6526.719
like the air gets cold there's all kinds

6524.8 --> 6530.56
of ways but

6526.719 --> 6534.56
i don't think that like literal

6530.56 --> 6535.6
person alike manifestations ghostly

6534.56 --> 6536.56
are

6535.6 --> 6537.92
like

6536.56 --> 6540.639
spirit

6537.92 --> 6544.639
creatures i think they are more like

6540.639 --> 6546.96
echoes it's like an echo of the spirit

6544.639 --> 6548.639
absorbed in the area

6546.96 --> 6549.84
and it's like a

6548.639 --> 6552.400000000001
like a

6549.84 --> 6554.32
left behind movie reel on a spiritual

6552.4 --> 6556.638999999999
level that you can tap into you give it

6554.32 --> 6558.4
a bit of energy it starts telling its

6556.639 --> 6561.679
story

6558.4 --> 6561.679
that's what i think about that

6564.88 --> 6571.4400000000005
do you think some ghost videos are cgi

6567.52 --> 6573.360000000001
and not real yeah some of them

6571.44 --> 6576.638999999999
i mean there's massive grappling going

6573.36 --> 6576.639
on there for a long time

6579.599 --> 6583.4400000000005
but

6580.96 --> 6585.36
yeah i i'm not relying

6583.44 --> 6588.5599999999995
on videos

6585.36 --> 6592.199
for my ghost research

6588.56 --> 6592.1990000000005
i don't need to

6596.0 --> 6599.599
if that was all i ever had then i would

6598.56 --> 6602.88
have never

6599.599 --> 6602.88
i would have lost interest

6605.44 --> 6608.719
right but i'm gonna round out the show

6606.96 --> 6611.119
guys it's been great

6608.719 --> 6613.84

6615.599 --> 6619.360000000001

worrying that's

6669.52 --> 6673.599
