95.68 --> 101.119
yeah very cloudy

there is wind and the clouds up there

hasn't been any rain

105.84 --> 111.84
so far in the day

109.04 --> 115.64
but there was in the night

111.84 --> 115.64
it's very moist

122.159 --> 125.92
but yeah it's not super cold

127.2 --> 130.879
but maybe that's just the moist

137.04 --> 142.239
hello jeff gassett first in chat

139.76 --> 146.07999999999998
good to see you

142.239 --> 147.58
it is wednesday the 6th of april

146.08 --> 149.12
2022.

147.58 --> 151.36
[Music]

149.12 --> 151.36
oh

152.239 --> 155.12
cam freeze

155.599 --> 160.64
out of nowhere

157.92 --> 160.64
and i'm back

167.2 --> 171.83999999999997
hello matthew hall good to see you

180.56 --> 184.2
get some light

192.879 --> 197.12
oh man

195.2 --> 199.11999999999998
i'm a little flustered

197.12 --> 200.64000000000001
that's because i listened back some old

199.12 --> 203.92000000000002
music

200.64 --> 207.27999999999997
that i used to listen to a lot

203.92 --> 211.879
and it yeah that stuff really

207.28 --> 211.879
yeah gets me dreaming hard

214.799 --> 218.87900000000002
mind in a box

216.48 --> 220.79899999999998
because owen benjamin had a stream

218.879 --> 222.79899999999998
yesterday and i always only started

220.799 --> 225.04000000000002
watching it today

222.799 --> 227.519
but then he started playing this house

225.04 --> 229.04
music and i was like

227.519 --> 231.20000000000002
no

229.04 --> 233.67999999999998
no that's

231.2 --> 233.67999999999998
the worst

234.4 --> 240.08
so then yeah said was basically

237.439 --> 242.319
commenting and beat

240.08 --> 243.28
no big bear that's terrible

242.319 --> 244.39999999999998
i

243.28 --> 246.48
whatever

244.4 --> 248.08
here's mine in the box and then like my

246.48 --> 253.23899999999998
favorite songs and then i started

248.08 --> 253.239
listening back to them and now i'm all

254.56 --> 259.919
i'm a bit shocked this isn't like what

256.4 --> 259.919
that music can even do to you

264.32 --> 270.0
it kind of disrupted my my startup

266.72 --> 273.759
routine in a way or rather it like

270.0 --> 273.759
gave it an unexpected kick

278.24 --> 283.32
hey

279.919 --> 283.32
where is everybody

289.199 --> 293.759
right so i'm just dreaming about that

292.08 --> 296.0
and about well

293.759 --> 298.96000000000004
i was listening mostly to it like when i

296.0 --> 302.56
was with my ex-girlfriend

298.96 --> 303.35999999999996
and also makes me realize like

302.56 --> 307.759
i

303.36 --> 307.759
i think i use that music to literally

308.4 --> 314.96
escape it with like next to my

312.08 --> 314.96
girlfriend even

317.68 --> 320.8
probably because

321.199 --> 327.12
i really couldn't actually handle

324.96 --> 330.71999999999997
like being with her

327.12 --> 333.6
and like the the realizations of that

330.72 --> 336.08000000000004
so i used it to escape it in a bit and

333.6 --> 339.08000000000004
it is great music and it is in the style

336.08 --> 339.08
and

340.96 --> 346.71999999999997
this just makes me wonder like what if i

343.12 --> 348.16
hadn't listened to that music at all

346.72 --> 349.29
there would have been other music but

348.16 --> 352.72
still

349.29 --> 352.72
[Music]

357.36 --> 361.91900000000004
hey

358.96 --> 365.479
i had blocked ears once and began to

361.919 --> 365.479
like pop music

366.96 --> 372.88
yeah no what they roll out now is so

370.08 --> 372.88
atrocious

373.759 --> 378.24
in this age

375.44 --> 380.88
this period of time it's just

378.24 --> 382.479
really terrible

380.88 --> 385.68
and then when i listened to some of

382.479 --> 389.199
these songs back from mine in the box

385.68 --> 392.759
it there's a song in there that's

389.199 --> 392.759
almost like

394.16 --> 398.319
prophetic

395.36 --> 401.52000000000004
in a way a lot of it is kind of like

398.319 --> 403.91900000000004
introvert prophetic it is pretty amazing

401.52 --> 409.0
mind in the body it really is

403.919 --> 409.0
not just melodically but also the text

410.479 --> 415.919
but it was basically talking about like

412.639 --> 420.319
hey where are all the people

415.919 --> 424.15999999999997
why why isn't there like what happened

420.319 --> 424.16
basically what happened to the parties

427.68 --> 432.40000000000003
and i never really understood at in that

430.56 --> 433.36
time like what it was talking about but

432.4 --> 436.15999999999997
now

433.36 --> 438.96000000000004
i realized like oh it could very well be

436.16 --> 442.0
that this guy knew about like the the

438.96 --> 442.0
lockdown is coming

442.88 --> 447.68
and this song was a little bit about

445.44 --> 450.16
that

447.68 --> 454.72
but could then also just be seen as

450.16 --> 454.72
psychological introvert so yeah

454.8 --> 457.599
very smart

461.68 --> 465.599
but it was such a different age man to

464.24 --> 468.0
me

465.599 --> 470.87899999999996
like 10 years ago it was so different

468.0 --> 472.8
like the entire world was different

470.879 --> 474.56
like the energies that were going around

472.8 --> 479.24
and how people dealt with them it was

474.56 --> 479.24
all different from what it has become

497.759 --> 502.40000000000003
anyway so yeah i'm just

500.8 --> 504.40000000000003
thinking about that

502.4 --> 506.31899999999996
i'd love to be able to play some music

504.4 --> 507.19899999999996
but i know

506.319 --> 509.199
that

507.199 --> 510.56
yeah that's probably going to give me

509.199 --> 513.519
like

510.56 --> 516.839
either a strike or just demonetization

513.519 --> 516.839
from the video

534.64 --> 538.72
all right so yeah what have you guys

536.16 --> 538.7199999999999
been up to

540.399 --> 544.08
yesterday's flat earth debate was pretty

542.24 --> 545.2
good

544.08 --> 549.8000000000001
although i

545.2 --> 549.8000000000001
missed a big chunk of it

564.56 --> 569.7199999999999
made by jim bob another great stream

576.8 --> 581.24
what else was i doing yesterday

595.76 --> 598.08
hmm

598.48 --> 604.04
yeah listening to my inbox has fuzzied

600.64 --> 604.04
it up a bit

613.519 --> 616.8
i do know that i didn't go to bed very

615.44 --> 619.839
late

616.8 --> 619.8389999999999
i had a good rest

622.72 --> 627.36
although i do

624.24 --> 627.36
these days i guess

628.079 --> 631.76
i'm a nostalgic i wake up nostalgic a

630.88 --> 635.519
lot

631.76 --> 635.519
like i'm with my ex-girlfriend again

637.12 --> 643.279
it's like i'm always trying to

639.12 --> 643.279
in my dreams trying to puzzle out

644.839 --> 648.399
like yeah

650.48 --> 654.9590000000001
how could it potentially

653.6 --> 658.0790000000001
through

654.959 --> 661.5189999999999
my social skill interaction dynamics how

658.079 --> 664.2399999999999
could it have eventually led to

661.519 --> 666.48
where i originally envisioned it all to

664.24 --> 666.48
go

667.2 --> 672.1600000000001
like with her as my wife etc but yeah

670.16 --> 672.8389999999999
it's like a puzzle that can never truly

672.16 --> 675.1999999999999
be

672.839 --> 677.7600000000001
solved but

675.2 --> 680.88
i sort of consciously know that but in

677.76 --> 680.88
my dreams a lot

683.04 --> 688.279
i do like pick up the puzzle again

690.88 --> 693.2
hmm

700.88 --> 706.48
hey seeking star wars

703.2 --> 709.9590000000001
tv shows good last few weeks

706.48 --> 709.9590000000001
don't know why

712.08 --> 715.279
[Music]

716.56 --> 719.5189999999999
because of the energy the energy in the

718.72 --> 721.76
air

719.519 --> 721.76
right

722.24 --> 727.04
energy that feeds our inspiration and

724.959 --> 731.0
our drive

727.04 --> 731.0
i'd say that's the reason

731.2 --> 737.2
and also because of the i guess the

733.519 --> 739.68
psychological warfare makes it necessary

737.2 --> 741.76
it's like we have to be great in order

739.68 --> 745.04
to

741.76 --> 748.399
give people an option to step away from

745.04 --> 748.399
all that insanity

749.6 --> 754.62
and if you're just weak and uninspired

752.16 --> 757.749
it doesn't work

754.62 --> 757.749
[Music]

759.92 --> 765.04
right in a way

762.16 --> 766.959
we are like

765.04 --> 768.8
uh

766.959 --> 771.1999999999999
a counter-intelligence in this

768.8 --> 773.04
psychological warfare situation we're

771.2 --> 776.8000000000001
all in

773.04 --> 779.5999999999999
trolls having meltdowns yes that too

776.8 --> 781.92
but that's been going on for a while

779.6 --> 784.32
but as we grow stronger and more

781.92 --> 786.88
energetic so do they because they get

784.32 --> 790.0790000000001
triggered right our level of energy

786.88 --> 790.959
trigger triggers their level of energy

790.079 --> 794.88
you see

790.959 --> 794.88
that's how it's always worked by the way

796.079 --> 800.16
right there's nothing

797.76 --> 801.76
like a flat earther

800.16 --> 804.56
that's like

801.76 --> 806.959
sharp and witty

804.56 --> 809.279
getting in between a group of ballers to

806.959 --> 812.4799999999999
absolutely rile them up and make them

809.279 --> 814.639
dream a lot

812.48 --> 817.12
nothing does that like a flat earther

814.639 --> 819.519
jumping in

817.12 --> 821.68
and the same goes for when they come to

819.519 --> 821.68
us

827.68 --> 833.199
so yeah it's not really the trolls

830.88 --> 835.68
that give us our energy it's us that

833.199 --> 840.3599999999999
gives them their energy

835.68 --> 840.3599999999999
you got to realize that that's the order

855.12 --> 861.9590000000001
all right anyway i got a gusto

858.24 --> 861.9590000000001
it's a green tea

865.56 --> 868.63
[Music]

885.15 --> 888.299
[Music]

894.0 --> 898.16
ah

895.13 --> 899.92
[Music]

898.16 --> 903.04
right so yeah i definitely came to the

899.92 --> 908.24
conclusion that i peaked sunday

903.04 --> 908.24
that show was really exceptionally good

909.04 --> 915.68
but after that it's kind of like yeah

912.8 --> 916.959
it's back down the hill i'm noticing

915.68 --> 920.4799999999999
it's just

916.959 --> 923.04
it was so focused in that thing

920.48 --> 924.16
unexpectedly

923.04 --> 926.48
and now

924.16 --> 929.92
it's just more

926.48 --> 929.9200000000001
general eyewitness

930.67 --> 933.78
[Music]

934.639 --> 939.199
i love the way i destroyed the trolls

936.32 --> 939.1990000000001
from their insides

941.44 --> 945.2790000000001
right well i just

944.32 --> 947.36
you know

945.279 --> 949.36
it's basically psychologically back

947.36 --> 952.0790000000001
engineering like why are they doing it

949.36 --> 955.279
but do it like doing that process not

952.079 --> 957.8389999999999
from uh you're a little man

955.279 --> 959.279
but actually getting in their skin and

957.839 --> 961.12
then

959.279 --> 963.279
just like yeah

961.12 --> 965.36
that's logical

963.279 --> 967.279
just i'm not even assuming that they're

965.36 --> 968.48
evil they're just not in control of

967.279 --> 971.04
themselves

968.48 --> 974.0
but the way that then works and that

971.04 --> 976.16
proceeds is very systematic and

974.0 --> 979.12
predictable actually

976.16 --> 982.16
but you have to bypass when you do that

979.12 --> 984.079
process in your mind you have to bypass

982.16 --> 986.48
yourself

984.079 --> 987.4399999999999
and realize that they too are just a

986.48 --> 989.839
person

987.44 --> 990.72
they're just not really in control

989.839 --> 993.2790000000001
right

990.72 --> 995.839
because if you let your own ego into

993.279 --> 997.68
that process then it becomes polarized

995.839 --> 999.2790000000001
and then it's like looking down and then

997.68 --> 1001.5999999999999
you don't get the picture accurately

999.279 --> 1004.32
because you're basing the picture

1001.6 --> 1007.279
on the relation between you and your

1004.32 --> 1010.72
position and theirs

1007.279 --> 1013.68
so what i do is i basically dissolve

1010.72 --> 1014.639
myself in the moment then sneak inside

1013.68 --> 1017.4399999999999
of them

1014.639 --> 1021.48
and then tell them exactly

1017.44 --> 1021.48
what they're doing and why

1027.439 --> 1031.919
and i've gotten

1029.36 --> 1034.7199999999998
very proficient at it

1031.919 --> 1034.72
over the years

1036.559 --> 1041.439
i mean i've always used to do that sort

1038.64 --> 1042.959
of thing but i just kept it inside

1041.439 --> 1045.6000000000001
usually because

1042.959 --> 1047.439
the very realization of the process

1045.6 --> 1049.4399999999998
would make me too enthusiastic to

1047.439 --> 1051.8400000000001
properly control my

1049.44 --> 1053.8400000000001
my speech i would start to like stutter

1051.84 --> 1056.32
from enthusiasm

1053.84 --> 1057.6
like 10 years ago 20 years ago in that

google search that area 51 scientist

1310.24 --> 1315.28
from independence day and google

1312.799 --> 1317.52
immediately gave me exactly the right

1315.28 --> 1319.36
result that was like

1317.52 --> 1321.679
really

1319.36 --> 1321.6789999999999
okay

1322.64 --> 1326.72
i thought i i would have to dig a little

1324.96 --> 1328.64
further but it

1326.72 --> 1331.52
it apparently

1328.64 --> 1333.6000000000001
was very willing to show me straight to

1331.52 --> 1335.18

1670.32 --> 1676.08
maybe it'll pop up

1672.0 --> 1678.08
at netflix when they flick through that

1676.08 --> 1680.0
there's not a lot in there that is

1678.08 --> 1682.399
really interesting like oh yeah there's

1680.0 --> 1684.559
like 30 things that are

1682.399 --> 1686.7199999999998
like 50 things that are always staring

1684.559 --> 1691.799
in my face and i'm like yeah i know i

1686.72 --> 1691.799
never want to watch you thanks

i don't know who that is

1932 okay

1725.679 --> 1730.0
cool i guess i don't know i haven't seen

1728.159 --> 1734.3600000000001
the the first one

1730.0 --> 1734.36
or i might have but i've forgotten

1737.96 --> 1741.039
[Music]

1742.08 --> 1745.08

1754.32 --> 1757.32
so

1780.28 --> 1783.43
[Music]

1790.96 --> 1793.96
okay

1796.72 --> 1801.52
well

1797.919 --> 1803.1200000000001
i did a search on yellowstone

1801.52 --> 1805.76
like in

1803.12 --> 1809.7199999999998
netflix but it it didn't help there's no

1805.76 --> 1809.72
yellowstone there so

1812.32 --> 1818.84
it's kind of disappointing

1814.24 --> 1818.84
i might have to download it

1824.799 --> 1829.039
hulu

1825.76 --> 1829.039
i don't even know what that is

1830.0 --> 1836.52
all right

1832.399 --> 1836.52
is it a series or a movie

1848.77 --> 1851.789
[Music]

1866.08 --> 1869.36
2000 no wait

1870.399 --> 1873.9189999999999
american yellowstone

1874.76 --> 1880.399
2018 is that the one

1879.2 --> 1883.679
series

1880.399 --> 1883.6789999999999
hmm that can't be it

1883.84 --> 1888.039
there's no series on here

1896.72 --> 1902.72
or if there is then it's just one little

1899.039 --> 1905.72
episode so that doesn't really help

1902.72 --> 1905.72
yeah

1906.0 --> 1911.36
all right

1907.679 --> 1911.3600000000001
might have to try sometime later

1914.399 --> 1920.1999999999998
okay well in that case i probably

1916.399 --> 1920.1999999999998
haven't watched it

1926.48 --> 1930.48
i mean if it's like 20 years old i could

1928.559 --> 1932.84
have seen it like on television at some

1930.48 --> 1936.48
point or whatever

1932.84 --> 1939.84
but yeah if it's like

1936.48 --> 1942.159
10 years old or less then the only way i

1939.84 --> 1945.36
could have even seen it is by watching

1942.159 --> 1948.3600000000001
it on netflix or downloading it

1945.36 --> 1948.36
so

1952.88 --> 1957.64
hey reflex curvature good to see you

1976.799 --> 1979.12
hmm

1981.36 --> 1984.399
spike tv

1986.72 --> 1990.3600000000001
yeah that's not helping

1998.32 --> 2004.799
you think anymore on the whiteboard

2002.48 --> 2007.2
yeah i don't have it

2004.799 --> 2007.2
also

2007.76 --> 2012.399
yeah if it would be a physical

2009.76 --> 2012.399
whiteboard

2017.519 --> 2021.519
like with the amount of screen

2019.679 --> 2023.3600000000001
availability here

2021.519 --> 2025.44
in the show

2023.36 --> 2027.6789999999999
it'd probably be better if it was like a

2025.44 --> 2029.8400000000001
very small white board so i could

2027.679 --> 2030.8400000000001
literally just draw something on it and

2029.84 --> 2034.0
show

2030.84 --> 2037.9189999999999
it it's what i kind of do now with paper

2034.0 --> 2037.919
but it would be better visible

2039.679 --> 2043.3600000000001
but i could do that

2041.679 --> 2044.72
like if it's just a very small

2043.36 --> 2047.84
whiteboard it shouldn't even be

2044.72 --> 2047.84
expensive or anything

2049.359 --> 2054.48
actually there might be a whiteboard in

2051.679 --> 2054.48
this house

2054.8 --> 2058.8390000000004
no wait no that was thrown away it was

2057.599 --> 2061.599
kind of broken

2058.839 --> 2065.2799999999997
anyway right

2061.599 --> 2068.0
but yeah it could do that

2065.28 --> 2069.679
it would be hilarious wow hilarious

2068.0 --> 2070.72
maybe depends on what i'm gonna do with

2069.679 --> 2074.839
it right

2070.72 --> 2074.839
but it would be kind of useful

2077.2 --> 2081.359
sometimes

2078.48 --> 2083.919
most of the time now i just kind of

2081.359 --> 2085.839
use my hands to visually try to describe

2083.919 --> 2089.52
things but then even when i watch back

2085.839 --> 2093.2
i'm noticing like wait

2089.52 --> 2096.599
like half of it is outside of the camera

2093.2 --> 2096.5989999999997
even so

2111.04 --> 2114.88
which makes me think also that

2113.839 --> 2119.359
maybe

2114.88 --> 2121.359
maybe i should re-tool the setup again

2119.359 --> 2122.72
because like yeah when i'm just sitting

2121.359 --> 2124.96
here like this

2122.72 --> 2128.0
yeah it looks nice and symmetrical and

2124.96 --> 2130.88
all that but when i want to be using my

2128.0 --> 2133.92
hands to be descriptive then it actually

2130.88 --> 2133.92
isn't all that great

2142.96 --> 2150.32
i've been trying to work around it

2146.079 --> 2150.32
but yeah maybe there will be another

2151.839 --> 2156.88
retooling

2154.079 --> 2158.96
of the interface of this show

2156.88 --> 2163.44
so that it can have more

2158.96 --> 2163.44
hand maneuvering room on screen

2167.599 --> 2171.52
all right hearing themselves contradict

2169.76 --> 2175.0400000000004
their position they have affirmed in

2171.52 --> 2175.04
writing his press yeah yeah sure

2176.079 --> 2180.32
well yeah even if like a troll comes in

2178.32 --> 2182.32
here or something

2180.32 --> 2184.7200000000003
and starts saying stupid things then i

2182.32 --> 2186.8
could literally just write it down

2184.72 --> 2190.0789999999997
most of the time though i can just point

2186.8 --> 2191.6800000000003
at the chat right i'm already kind of

2190.079 --> 2193.76
teaching everybody the discipline

2191.68 --> 2195.839
despite the wrenches to just leave them

2193.76 --> 2198.4
alone

2195.839 --> 2201.04
to leave the comments there

2198.4 --> 2203.6800000000003
even if they're really idiotic and just

2201.04 --> 2203.68
ad homie

2204.8 --> 2208.1600000000003
but

2205.52 --> 2209.839
a troll board

2208.16 --> 2212.7999999999997
right it's just an

2209.839 --> 2214.56
just a little white board and a pencil

2212.8 --> 2217.3590000000004
could be kind of you it's kind of a good

2214.56 --> 2217.359
idea actually

2219.28 --> 2224.5600000000004
so i will be keeping an eye out for that

2222.48 --> 2226.4
out there

2224.56 --> 2229.599
i mean the store where typically buy my

2226.4 --> 2231.76
tobacco also has like writing equipment

2229.599 --> 2234.96
and pens of all sorts

2231.76 --> 2237.28
paper so they might have it oh

2234.96 --> 2239.52
yeah i'll browse around for a bit maybe

2237.28 --> 2239.52
ask

2240.0 --> 2245.92
and if they don't have it then i'm very

2242.079 --> 2245.92
certain that there is like a real

2246.56 --> 2251.839
paper and art

2248.88 --> 2252.8
store and they were are certain to have

2251.839 --> 2257.4
it

2252.8 --> 2257.4
it's more like in the middle of the city

2266.24 --> 2271.72
have an eloquent shorthand what do you

2268.72 --> 2271.72
mean

2274.79 --> 2277.949
[Music]

2296.839 --> 2301.92
yeah okay that is hilarious that flat

2300.079 --> 2304.079
fellow but i'm afraid that's like too

2301.92 --> 2307.839
difficult

2304.079 --> 2310.32
like if we made a recorded video sketch

2307.839 --> 2313.68
then you could add that on

2310.32 --> 2314.56
for comedic effect but to have that live

2313.68 --> 2316.7999999999997
yeah

2314.56 --> 2316.7999999999997
no

2319.28 --> 2323.6800000000003
although technically you know if we're

2324.96 --> 2329.52
and we are very prepared

2327.28 --> 2332.079
with like counter arguments and know

2329.52 --> 2334.88
what the trolls will ask then we can you

2332.079 --> 2335.92
can just like you have can have a sound

2334.88 --> 2338.2400000000002
board

2335.92 --> 2341.52
right with buttons with sounds coming

2338.24 --> 2343.4399999999996
out of it very typical radio

2341.52 --> 2345.92
it can be very annoying too and

2343.44 --> 2348.96
attention grabby but you could do that

2345.92 --> 2351.6800000000003
the same technically with like visual

2348.96 --> 2354.0
animation you press a button and some

2351.68 --> 2356.3999999999996
specific visual animation happens on

2354.0 --> 2356.4
screen

2360.0 --> 2363.76
and yeah if you have then a switchboard

2362.079 --> 2366.4
with like

2363.76 --> 2368.6400000000003
yeah you could require some preparation

2366.4 --> 2370.96
a switchboard

2368.64 --> 2373.5989999999997
like with typical troll remarks and then

2370.96 --> 2376.8
a good response to it and then just like

2373.599 --> 2378.0
oh he's saying this one click

2376.8 --> 2382.04
yeah

2378.0 --> 2382.04
that is technically possible

2382.48 --> 2386.03
it would require a lot of preparation

2384.56 --> 2390.64
work though

2386.03 --> 2392.0
[Music]

2390.64 --> 2393.68
and

2392.0 --> 2395.52
it would probably run out of

2393.68 --> 2397.839
effectiveness

2395.52 --> 2399.52
eventually it's not gonna be like funny

2397.839 --> 2401.92
forever you know

2399.52 --> 2405.599
like that's why like switchboards with

2401.92 --> 2408.2400000000002
like funny noises and [ __ ] i hate that

2405.599 --> 2410.319
it's literally funny like maybe once and

2408.24 --> 2413.2799999999997
after that point it's like oh

2410.319 --> 2415.119
to me right maybe there's some radio

2413.28 --> 2417.52
boomers out there that just love that

2415.119 --> 2418.44
[ __ ] funny sounds and they can't get

2417.52 --> 2419.599
enough of it

2418.44 --> 2421.68
[Music]

2419.599 --> 2424.56
i'm not saying you're stupid i'm just

2421.68 --> 2426.56
saying i don't think that's entertaining

2424.56 --> 2429.52
at all

2426.56 --> 2429.52
just distracting

2430.72 --> 2435.48
please do it you'd go viral no i

2432.48 --> 2435.48
wouldn't

2444.96 --> 2448.48
but i mean hey

2446.319 --> 2450.56
if somebody like refracted curvature

2448.48 --> 2452.72
wants to actually

2450.56 --> 2456.24
make a matrix

2452.72 --> 2458.0789999999997
for typical troll remarks and responses

2456.24 --> 2460.319
that would cover like the full spectrum

2458.079 --> 2462.48
if he wants to do that and i know he can

2460.319 --> 2465.839
he's very smart and he'd probably think

2462.48 --> 2468.319
it's very entertaining to do that

2465.839 --> 2469.7599999999998
then i'd at least take a look at it

2468.319 --> 2471.68
and then maybe

2469.76 --> 2474.6400000000003
if it's like okay this one is actually

2471.68 --> 2478.16
really good then

2474.64 --> 2481.5989999999997
i would like ask adam meekin like hey

2478.16 --> 2483.2799999999997
i had this crazy idea

2481.599 --> 2485.76
john made it

2483.28 --> 2489.0400000000004
like a switchboard with like visual

2485.76 --> 2489.0400000000004
troll responses

2489.599 --> 2494.6400000000003
or a spectrum of troll responses and

2491.92 --> 2496.88
then like

2494.64 --> 2499.44
like what would be the perfect response

2496.88 --> 2501.52
and then can we animate that

2499.44 --> 2503.599
and how can you implement that in obs

2501.52 --> 2508.319
very easily

2503.599 --> 2510.8
or bypass obs perhaps even

2508.319 --> 2510.8
i don't know

2512.44 --> 2518.319
[Music]

2514.48 --> 2520.72
yeah audio clips would be more

2518.319 --> 2523.119
typical but i don't want to do that i

2520.72 --> 2525.5989999999997
don't want to be that guy you know it's

2523.119 --> 2529.599
just i just want to be me here and the

2525.599 --> 2529.599
natural sounds from outside

2533.28 --> 2540.28
i mean i don't even play music

2536.72 --> 2540.2799999999997
during my show

2563.599 --> 2565.839
um

2568.35 --> 2571.409
[Music]

2581.68 --> 2586.1189999999997
okay

2583.119 --> 2586.119
what

2596.56 --> 2601.24
i think we got a derp alert here

2608.48 --> 2614.16
right also i don't know like how

2610.8 --> 2616.0
somebody being into somebody's wearing a

2614.16 --> 2618.3999999999996
suit how that can make you lose

2616.0 --> 2622.079
credibility really i mean it will make

2618.4 --> 2623.6800000000003
you look silly for sure right

2622.079 --> 2627.2000000000003
does that have to do with like

2623.68 --> 2627.2
intellectual credibility

2627.92 --> 2630.8
serious like

2631.28 --> 2636.4
i'm not a super big fan of miggy

2635.599 --> 2637.839
but

2636.4 --> 2640.079
to me it's poi i'm not going to be

2637.839 --> 2643.359
savagne towards him

2640.079 --> 2644.1600000000003
but like oh no he likes he really was

2643.359 --> 2646.48
thought

2644.16 --> 2648.3999999999996
nathan thompson's duck suit was really

2646.48 --> 2651.2
cool or funny like

2648.4 --> 2652.8
oh oh god oh now he's not credible

2651.2 --> 2656.5989999999997
anymore what

2652.8 --> 2656.599
how does that even work

2662.72 --> 2667.359
is there a judgment it was obviously a

2665.44 --> 2668.319
hoax

2667.359 --> 2670.0789999999997
what you

2668.319 --> 2674.16
are you saying that miggy thought it was

2670.079 --> 2677.1600000000003
like really cool activism or something

2674.16 --> 2677.16
uh

2681.92 --> 2687.359
like a hoax

2683.52 --> 2690.72
so he thought it was real then

2687.359 --> 2694.319
was that even brought up

2690.72 --> 2694.319
you're not being very clear here

2698.72 --> 2704.2
he was excited about an experiment

2701.2 --> 2704.2
really

2706.72 --> 2712.56
and was he excited about it because of

2710.4 --> 2714.88
the actual experiment or because of the

2712.56 --> 2716.319
media stunt that was apparently taking

2714.88 --> 2719.04
place

2716.319 --> 2721.92
right there's two factors to that

2719.04 --> 2723.92
one is the like oh this is

2721.92 --> 2725.6800000000003
this will reach a wider public or this

2723.92 --> 2726.88
will grab the attention and then the

2725.68 --> 2729.2799999999997
other is

2726.88 --> 2730.319
okay this is actually a good piece of

2729.28 --> 2733.7200000000003
data

2730.319 --> 2733.72
that they're creating

2736.8 --> 2742.48
so

2738.16 --> 2742.48
which part was he hung up on more

2744.24 --> 2749.0
paradigm [ __ ] okay and that sounds silly

2772.64 --> 2775.839
all right well yeah

2776.16 --> 2780.72
oh maybe he had a weak moment then

2779.04 --> 2782.48
just didn't really think about it or

2780.72 --> 2785.04
maybe he was already getting sick of it

2782.48 --> 2785.04
all right

2786.48 --> 2790.96
i mean

2787.68 --> 2793.839
dealing with trolls concerning all this

2790.96 --> 2796.2400000000002
is really draining

2793.839 --> 2798.96
and when you get drained

2796.24 --> 2802.16
things become chaotic you lose oversight

2798.96 --> 2804.319
you might not catch on to something

2802.16 --> 2804.319
so

2805.04 --> 2809.44
yeah it doesn't really

2807.2 --> 2810.56
make any difference though when it comes

2809.44 --> 2813.68
to

2810.56 --> 2817.359
like physical argumentation

2813.68 --> 2817.359
concerning flat earth and globe

2825.76 --> 2830.3190000000004
all right

2827.04 --> 2832.4
yeah well maybe he did give up on that

2830.319 --> 2834.88
formula indeed because

2832.4 --> 2837.6800000000003
there's not really a lot of fe proof you

2834.88 --> 2840.559
need to be looking for at this point

2837.68 --> 2843.1189999999997
right the real challenge is trying to

2840.559 --> 2845.8390000000004
find globe proof now that is a real

2843.119 --> 2845.839
challenge

2847.599 --> 2851.44
and yeah not everybody that gets into

2850.24 --> 2854.16
flat earth

2851.44 --> 2855.68
and even seeks the attention is going to

2854.16 --> 2858.319
stay there

2855.68 --> 2861.1189999999997
because they kind of get sick of certain

2858.319 --> 2862.24
type of people that keep nagging and

2861.119 --> 2863.839
nagging

2862.24 --> 2865.52
and ad-humming

2863.839 --> 2868.48
all the time

2865.52 --> 2870.4
yeah some people are just not suckers

2868.48 --> 2872.72
for punishment

2870.4 --> 2875.28
they don't want a prospect of like oh

2872.72 --> 2877.359
yay whatever i do

2875.28 --> 2879.0400000000004
however good i am or however bad i am

2877.359 --> 2881.7599999999998
there's always going to be people that

2879.04 --> 2884.24
are going to try to nag me to death yeah

2881.76 --> 2886.2400000000002
some people out there

2884.24 --> 2887.2799999999997
kind of give up because of that over

2886.24 --> 2890.3999999999996
time

2887.28 --> 2892.3190000000004
you know i don't blame him

2890.4 --> 2894.96
being in an overt

2892.319 --> 2896.8
online flat earther is very punishing

2894.96 --> 2898.839
because you get to deal with like the

2896.8 --> 2903.04
worst

2898.839 --> 2903.04
elements of society

2903.44 --> 2908.16
or yeah psychologically at least

2907.04 --> 2910.4
so

2908.16 --> 2911.2799999999997
right and nobody stops them

2910.4 --> 2914.4
right

2911.28 --> 2917.3590000000004
like look at out there like oh general

2914.4 --> 2919.839
people bullies they get all the flack

2917.359 --> 2921.52
and like oh how dare you send that tweet

2919.839 --> 2923.7599999999998
right you're banned

2921.52 --> 2925.119
you had the wrong opinion well with us

2923.76 --> 2927.599
like

2925.119 --> 2928.96
people can say whatever nasty [ __ ] they

2927.599 --> 2932.4
want

2928.96 --> 2932.4
and nobody gives a [ __ ]

2933.44 --> 2939.04
that's not a flat earther like because

2936.48 --> 2941.28
in the general public's eye that really

2939.04 --> 2944.079
doesn't like flat earth it's like

2941.28 --> 2946.88
we don't understand that we

2944.079 --> 2949.04
we can't say that

2946.88 --> 2952.559
you can't go too far

2949.04 --> 2952.5589999999997
that's what happens a lot of the time

2953.599 --> 2958.4
so we get to deal with like just waves

2956.24 --> 2960.319
of nastiness and you can always expect

2958.4 --> 2961.76
it to come back well for some people out

2960.319 --> 2963.92
there

2961.76 --> 2966.3190000000004
once that really starts to sink in like

2963.92 --> 2968.48
no it's actually really not going away

2966.319 --> 2971.2
these people will be out there always

2968.48 --> 2973.359
doing that no matter what happens yeah

2971.2 --> 2977.72
some people then give up

2973.359 --> 2977.72
and they move on to something else

2984.24 --> 2989.52
nice try

2986.8 --> 2989.52
nice try

2992.24 --> 2997.2
that's not a rebuttal it's not an answer

2994.96 --> 2998.8
to the question either

2997.2 --> 3001.2799999999997
seem to have a little problem here with

2998.8 --> 3004.88
the actual mechanics

3001.28 --> 3004.88
that are currently at hand

3005.76 --> 3012.13
how do you use a sextant

3008.96 --> 3015.469
on a curve how does that work

3012.13 --> 3015.469
[Music]

3028.319 --> 3033.52
a level has nothing to do with the shape

3030.64 --> 3033.52
of the ground what

3036.24 --> 3041.839
really then why then why are plumb bobs

3039.2 --> 3041.839
used

3049.28 --> 3053.76
isn't it always just the orientation in

3051.599 --> 3056.079
relation to the ground one position the

3053.76 --> 3058.7200000000003
other position

3056.079 --> 3060.319
and yeah the thing about plums is they

3058.72 --> 3062.9599999999996
always point

3060.319 --> 3064.079
in the same direction in relation to one

3062.96 --> 3066.4
another

3064.079 --> 3068.559
all the same directions one universal

3066.4 --> 3071.599
axis

3068.559 --> 3071.599
and then everywhere

3075.359 --> 3080.5589999999997
oh come on this is basic stuff yeah yeah

3077.92 --> 3083.8
yeah numpty yes

3080.559 --> 3083.8
we know

3097.44 --> 3101.599
level means different things in

3098.96 --> 3104.319
different contexts so what about

3101.599 --> 3105.44
in the geometric context

3104.319 --> 3108.92
huh

3105.44 --> 3108.92
what about that

3116.72 --> 3122.2
yes they are seeking star wars yes they

3119.2 --> 3122.2
are

[Music]

3126.72 --> 3132.0789999999997
what the [ __ ] is a geometric context

3129.839 --> 3135.2
hello

3132.079 --> 3136.8390000000004
you know what geometric means

3135.2 --> 3140.72
you know what context

3136.839 --> 3141.92
mean can't you put the words together

3140.72 --> 3144.72
basic

3141.92 --> 3147.28
communication here

3144.72 --> 3149.04
seem to be having some trouble there

3147.28 --> 3151.119
you just said oh look there's so many

3149.04 --> 3154.48
different

3151.119 --> 3157.2000000000003
meanings to level yeah i know

3154.48 --> 3158.48
that's why i asked how about a geometric

3157.2 --> 3161.2799999999997
context

3158.48 --> 3163.599
what is that yeah it's in the context of

3161.28 --> 3166.559
geometry level in the context of

3163.599 --> 3169.04
geometry be more specific are you

3166.559 --> 3169.0400000000004
kidding me

3170.24 --> 3173.68
right geometry

now what is level in relation to

3182.64 --> 3185.359
geometry

3186.96 --> 3193.48
yeah it's kind of synonymous to

3190.48 --> 3193.48
flat

3215.52 --> 3220.8
give me an accent i just did

3218.48 --> 3223.2
are you having like five minutes delay

3220.8 --> 3225.04
here or you're just not paying attention

3223.2 --> 3227.2799999999997
are you asking the questions because you

3225.04 --> 3228.96
literally just blanked out exactly the

3227.28 --> 3230.7200000000003
response that i gave

3228.96 --> 3231.92
to that question that you hadn't even

3230.72 --> 3235.04
asked yet

3231.92 --> 3237.839
what's going on here dude

3235.04 --> 3237.839
are you on drugs

3247.119 --> 3253.04

3249.44 --> 3253.04
blatant projection here

3260.64 --> 3267.7599999999998

3263.839 --> 3271.44
subject it's a very specific

3267.76 --> 3271.44
field you idiot

3271.839 --> 3276.72
like what the hell is wrong with you

3275.119 --> 3280.319
look at all you get the [ __ ] out of here

3276.72 --> 3280.319
dude shut the [ __ ] up

3281.119 --> 3283.92
it's pathetic

3284.48 --> 3290.88
you don't seem to be understanding the

3286.88 --> 3293.839
basic rudimentary functions of words and

3290.88 --> 3298.6800000000003

3293.839 --> 3298.68
i think you need to lay off those drugs

3318.72 --> 3322.8799999999997
yeah no it's full-on projection

3320.799 --> 3324.24
everything it is rejection

3322.88 --> 3326.0
that

3324.24 --> 3328.799
thing

3326.0 --> 3328.799
is satanic

3330.079 --> 3334.96
he literally got on drugs

3332.48 --> 3337.119
took this account

3334.96 --> 3340.64
and then started calling us weak and

3337.119 --> 3342.48
ridiculous it's 100 percent projecting

3340.64 --> 3345.5989999999997
everything about it everything he said

3342.48 --> 3347.28
was a giant projection

3345.599 --> 3352.2000000000003
it's a person that

3347.28 --> 3352.2000000000003
is not in control of his own faculties

3363.359 --> 3368.96
yeah i know refracted because i know

it's ridiculous

3368.96 --> 3372.68
i mean come on

3386.64 --> 3392.24
he scored at his last perhaps not i just

3388.72 --> 3394.3999999999996
timed him out i'm not gonna just ban him

3392.24 --> 3398.16
but yeah he needs to just take five

3394.4 --> 3400.2400000000002
minutes and squirt it off somewhere

3398.16 --> 3402.64
and then maybe get back to his faculties

3400.24 --> 3405.04
if he has any

3402.64 --> 3410.4
so that he can once again understand

3405.04 --> 3410.4
that geometry is a very specific field

3413.04 --> 3417.96
like come on dude come on

3428.4 --> 3432.64
can make you feel insane when there's so

3430.24 --> 3435.9199999999996
many people like him out there

3432.64 --> 3439.1189999999997
well it's lost people right when you're

3435.92 --> 3441.119
that lost in in rudimentary things a

3439.119 --> 3443.44
rudimentary understanding and oversight

3441.119 --> 3443.44
then

3443.76 --> 3448.1600000000003
it doesn't make me feel insane there out

3445.76 --> 3451.2000000000003
there it's just

3448.16 --> 3451.2
makes me worried

3452.4 --> 3457.599
right i've always known that the general

3455.68 --> 3460.64
public a lot of them are kind of weak

3457.599 --> 3462.799
and just managing to get by thanks to

3460.64 --> 3466.96
the help of others

3462.799 --> 3466.96
where their faculties are short

3467.52 --> 3471.04
but yeah

3469.52 --> 3472.319
they always kind of kept it to

3471.04 --> 3475.52
themselves

3472.319 --> 3476.4
most of the time or they would just

3475.52 --> 3478.319
be

3476.4 --> 3480.48
put in their place very quickly and then

3478.319 --> 3482.88
they actually accept it that's how i

3480.48 --> 3486.16
remember the world was kind of like

3482.88 --> 3488.88
right it seems now that instead

3486.16 --> 3490.64
nobody holds anybody accountable or it

3488.88 --> 3493.2000000000003
just doesn't work anymore and people

3490.64 --> 3494.8799999999997
just like go with the complete mental

3493.2 --> 3498.799
derangement

3494.88 --> 3501.599
they just let themselves go into it

3498.799 --> 3504.079
they don't reject it anymore

3501.599 --> 3507.28
this that's messed up it doesn't make me

3504.079 --> 3509.44
feel insane it makes me feel worried

3507.28 --> 3509.44
and

3512.24 --> 3517.2
yeah it's like

3513.76 --> 3520.079
can you please put that terrible

3517.2 --> 3521.9199999999996
way of going about back in the box

3520.079 --> 3524.4
just put it back

3521.92 --> 3525.92
and lock it and don't do it again it's

3524.4 --> 3529.48
not good for you it's not good for

3525.92 --> 3529.48
anyone anything

3532.079 --> 3536.799
like winning an apparent argument in a

3535.2 --> 3540.3999999999996
moment

3536.799 --> 3545.839
is not a good motivation

3540.4 --> 3545.839
right to sacrifice everything to

3547.119 --> 3551.44
it's not important to win it's important

3549.52 --> 3553.28
that you get things right that's the

3551.44 --> 3555.68
only thing that's really important in

3553.28 --> 3555.6800000000003
the end

3556.0 --> 3559.359
and if you make a mistake that you

3557.599 --> 3560.799
understand the mistake that you correct

3559.359 --> 3562.72
the mistake

3560.799 --> 3564.799
and that you then integrate that

3562.72 --> 3568.16
understanding and that learning process

3564.799 --> 3568.16
into your subconscious

3568.64 --> 3572.24
so that you'll recognize that mistake

3570.4 --> 3574.319
when others make it and then you can

3572.24 --> 3576.8799999999997
help them

3574.319 --> 3578.72
understand that mistake like you did and

3576.88 --> 3581.839
overcome it

3578.72 --> 3581.839
that's the way to go about

3582.559 --> 3588.2400000000002
don't just continue on

3585.359 --> 3591.359
when you're blatantly getting lost like

3588.24 --> 3593.9199999999996
if you don't get the rudimentary things

3591.359 --> 3596.24
correct anymore in an argument that's

3593.92 --> 3598.4
when you should stop that's like

3596.24 --> 3601.359
if you get banged on the head with a

3598.4 --> 3603.359
club and you're like all dizzy

3601.359 --> 3605.68
you don't just keep going like nothing

3603.359 --> 3605.68
happened

3606.799 --> 3612.079
you need to take a break and recover

3609.92 --> 3615.839
and then perhaps

3612.079 --> 3615.8390000000004
change your course of action

3621.119 --> 3624.119
anyway

3630.48 --> 3635.169
let's see if he gets back

3632.05 --> 3635.1690000000003
[Music]

3638.96 --> 3643.2
he should be out of his timeout now

3640.96 --> 3646.68
maybe he moved on

3643.2 --> 3646.68
back to discord

3655.44 --> 3662.21
[Music]

3665.44 --> 3669.799
thinks it's a plumbing tool

3670.64 --> 3673.75
[Music]

3677.04 --> 3681.2799999999997
it's hilarious by the way because i

3679.44 --> 3683.599
didn't know what a plum bob was like

3681.28 --> 3686.079
three years ago i just never heard that

3683.599 --> 3686.88
english word

3686.079 --> 3688.88
right

3686.88 --> 3690.559
so the first time i heard it i thought

3688.88 --> 3693.04
it had to do like something with

3690.559 --> 3696.88
plumbing tools i didn't inquire on it

3693.04 --> 3696.88
though i just listened a little longer

3696.96 --> 3704.0
until i figured out kind of what it is

3699.52 --> 3704.0
it's just a weight on a string

3705.839 --> 3709.359
but yeah

3707.44 --> 3713.2000000000003
a plump

3709.359 --> 3715.839
it does also remind me of plumbing

3713.2 --> 3718.0
on the surface it's

3715.839 --> 3721.0
very easy to figure out that it isn't

3718.0 --> 3721.0
though

3730.72 --> 3733.52
right so

3731.839 --> 3736.5589999999997
it seems

3733.52 --> 3738.48
like he's not returning

3736.559 --> 3741.7200000000003
he could but he's not

3738.48 --> 3741.72
oh well

3745.27 --> 3748.36
[Music]

3752.41 --> 3755.5099999999998
[Music]

3756.49 --> 3760.0099999999998
[Applause]

3792.24 --> 3795.3999999999996
thank you

3826.64 --> 3830.799
anyway

3827.839 --> 3830.799
just looking around

3830.88 --> 3838.0
it's an old name for lead okay

3833.92 --> 3841.16
they used to call it a led

3838.0 --> 3841.16
all right

3851.96 --> 3855.07
[Music]

3869.28 --> 3872.28
hmm

3880.559 --> 3883.6800000000003
oh look who's back

3885.92 --> 3892.16
oh

3887.039 --> 3892.1600000000003
he does know latin are you 12 years old

3893.039 --> 3898.559
because most people don't typically know

3896.319 --> 3903.319
that unless they're in the middle of

3898.559 --> 3903.3190000000004
school where they are studying latin

3919.76 --> 3923.039
[Music]

3958.72 --> 3963.0389999999998
yeah refracted well do they really say

3961.28 --> 3965.76
that though

3963.039 --> 3967.5200000000004
i mean they try might suggest that

3965.76 --> 3969.8390000000004
during an argument when they're stuck

3967.52 --> 3969.839
again

3974.16 --> 3977.359
right

3976.24 --> 3979.2799999999997
but

3977.359 --> 3982.0
yeah i mean the

3979.28 --> 3983.92
the navigation manuals on how to use a

3982.0 --> 3985.52
sextant are very clear and

3983.92 --> 3986.799
straightforward

3985.52 --> 3989.28
that's why

3986.799 --> 3993.079
10th man likes to collect those manuals

3989.28 --> 3993.079
like all of them

3994.559 --> 3999.039
like everything that you can pretty much

3996.48 --> 4001.359
find about sexton's 10th man has at this

3999.039 --> 4002.7200000000003
point

4001.359 --> 4006.64
and

4002.72 --> 4008.9599999999996
you really need to use it physically

4006.64 --> 4013.0389999999998
to know how it works or can you become

4008.96 --> 4015.28
an expert by reading the manual

4013.039 --> 4020.28
you tell me

4015.28 --> 4020.28
i've never used a sexton physically

4028.64 --> 4032.64
all right but yeah astrophysicists

4030.0 --> 4035.039
haven't done anything

4032.64 --> 4037.7599999999998
i mean astrophysicist these days don't

4035.039 --> 4039.28
even do anything

4037.76 --> 4041.8390000000004
on paper it's just

4039.28 --> 4043.599
computer stuff and they just have prefab

4041.839 --> 4046.24
program [ __ ]

4043.599 --> 4048.319
with which they do things it's it's such

4046.24 --> 4052.4399999999996
a waste of time they don't do anything

4048.319 --> 4052.44
they just assume everything

4064.319 --> 4067.319
wow

4082.559 --> 4087.559
ages palmer

4084.079 --> 4087.559
good to see you

4113.04 --> 4119.799
what what are you talking about youtube

4115.52 --> 4119.799000000001
i don't understand what you're saying

4121.14 --> 4124.2390000000005
[Music]

4126.48 --> 4130.44
a flip flat

4151.199 --> 4154.199
hmm

4170.109 --> 4173.179
[Music]

4195.92 --> 4200.4800000000005
they're pretending yeah youtube well

4198.08 --> 4203.12
that's ridiculous

4200.48 --> 4204.799999999999
if that's what they're doing really

4203.12 --> 4206.8
then they're doing it because they don't

4204.8 --> 4208.64
understand and they're basically like

4206.8 --> 4211.8
it's mystical to them and they think it

4208.64 --> 4211.8
is magical

4216.0 --> 4222.32
but only somebody that doesn't actually

4218.48 --> 4224.5599999999995
know how to use a sextant would think

4222.32 --> 4227.12
or could think

4224.56 --> 4230.4800000000005
that you might attain some

4227.12 --> 4231.44
higher knowledge of the sky when you use

4230.48 --> 4235.12
it

4231.44 --> 4237.04
now of course there is

4235.12 --> 4238.88
the higher knowledge is the realization

4237.04 --> 4240.96
that the earth is flat because it has to

4238.88 --> 4242.56
be flat or the entire tool wouldn't be

4240.96 --> 4245.52
working right

4242.56 --> 4246.719
but they refuse to see the details of

4245.52 --> 4249.719
that

4246.719 --> 4249.719
part

4281.199 --> 4287.839999999999
that's right taking star wars sexton is

4283.679 --> 4287.84
a triangulation device indeed

4288.0 --> 4292.719
and you still need a map

4290.239 --> 4295.759999999999
of the celestials

4292.719 --> 4297.04
you still need a cross reference

4295.76 --> 4298.719
right

4297.04 --> 4302.4
because just because you can see the

4298.719 --> 4305.12
angles doesn't mean that you can then

4302.4 --> 4307.36
only knowing the angles

4305.12 --> 4310.08
yeah find your way you have to actually

4307.36 --> 4312.88
know where the stars are in relation to

4310.08 --> 4315.679
the position on the map

4312.88 --> 4318.4800000000005
so you need that map

4315.679 --> 4321.4800000000005
to cross-reference your angular data

4318.48 --> 4321.48
with

4336.96 --> 4340.679
right back in two minutes

4447.6 --> 4450.6
um

4454.56 --> 4458.56
dude

4455.36 --> 4458.5599999999995
some fresh air here

4459.76 --> 4465.159000000001
oh it's raining again

4461.679 --> 4465.159
that makes sense

4505.52 --> 4508.64
hey stopping traffic i'm arrested good

4507.52 --> 4511.84
to see you

4508.64 --> 4511.84
how are you doing

4513.92 --> 4518.52
are you settling in in texas yet

4520.5 --> 4523.59
[Music]

4531.6 --> 4534.6
hmm

4561.6 --> 4564.6
hmm

4607.52 --> 4610.52
huh

4644.64 --> 4646.96
all right

4648.0 --> 4652.08
yeah

4648.88 --> 4654.56
i'm not in the best conditions today

4652.08 --> 4656.08
it's been kind of moving down for a

4654.56 --> 4657.84
while

4656.08 --> 4659.84
i think i might be getting sick or

4657.84 --> 4660.8
something

4659.84 --> 4662.719
from

4660.8 --> 4664.719
what probably correlates with the

4662.719 --> 4667.44
weather

4664.719 --> 4667.44
know what it is

4671.04 --> 4675.36
so yeah maybe

4672.64 --> 4675.360000000001
at some point

4675.6 --> 4680.159000000001
tomorrow or the day after maybe the

4677.44 --> 4683.599999999999
weekend i might just feel in a condition

4680.159 --> 4685.199
where i'm just gonna kind of like

4683.6 --> 4687.76
hang around

4685.199 --> 4691.5599999999995
my bed all day long

4687.76 --> 4691.56
this is gonna get worse

4692.08 --> 4697.84
i have i got for headaches too

4695.76 --> 4702.04
it's not really bad now yesterday

4697.84 --> 4702.04
evening i had like headache

4706.719 --> 4712.08
this is looking my jaw is acting a bit

4709.12 --> 4714.96
weird it's not terrible but it's like

4712.08 --> 4716.96
getting wobbly

4714.96 --> 4718.8
feeling so i might be getting sick or

4716.96 --> 4720.56
something and i don't know i haven't

4718.8 --> 4723.52
been really sick

4720.56 --> 4728.2390000000005
like actually like flew like sick in a

4723.52 --> 4728.2390000000005
long time so i wouldn't mind necessarily

4728.32 --> 4734.12
it's just not very nice when it's like

4730.32 --> 4734.12
approaching that time

4737.6 --> 4741.280000000001
all right but i'll just try to keep on

4739.28 --> 4742.639999999999
going and doing my shows but yeah

4741.28 --> 4746.239
they're

4742.64 --> 4746.2390000000005
not going to be super fluid

4746.64 --> 4750.4800000000005
i'll try to get back to a to a peak

4749.52 --> 4754.1990000000005
again

4750.48 --> 4754.199
as soon as i can

4768.32 --> 4771.92
oh really matthew youtube

4772.08 --> 4777.84
right it was all evening

4774.56 --> 4777.84
very annoying

4779.28 --> 4785.44
a bit of spring weather

4781.84 --> 4785.4400000000005
make me feel better yeah wealth

4786.159 --> 4790.5599999999995
i think that a couple of really nice

4788.239 --> 4793.36
clear sunny days yeah would absolutely

4790.56 --> 4793.360000000001
help for sure

4794.88 --> 4799.52
but yeah there's that's not on the menu

4796.8 --> 4802.96
right now so

4799.52 --> 4802.96
i have to just pull through this

4803.199 --> 4808.4
maybe maybe i should try to take some

4805.76 --> 4808.400000000001
vitamin d

4809.44 --> 4812.4
maybe that would help

4814.56 --> 4818.6
i think i might try that

4818.719 --> 4826.0
i haven't taken it in quite a while

4821.84 --> 4829.719
it has been great weather so yeah

4826.0 --> 4829.719
no plenty of sun

4837.44 --> 4840.44
so

4860.239 --> 4864.718999999999
yeah i'm glad you guys are keeping very

4862.8 --> 4866.8
close track to the

4864.719 --> 4868.88
mechanical arguments

4866.8 --> 4872.639
because in my head it's not really

4868.88 --> 4872.639
working out all that great right now

4872.96 --> 4880.56
i was gonna like to jump in

4876.8 --> 4880.56
then i got kind of nauseated

4885.04 --> 4888.56
but i see you guys can just easily

4887.199 --> 4892.04
handle it

4888.56 --> 4892.04
in my chat

4906.48 --> 4911.199
yeah i feel very lucky to basically be

4908.96 --> 4914.639
surrounded by plenty of people that are

4911.199 --> 4914.638999999999
very very good at math

4914.8 --> 4919.4400000000005
i'm not super good at it

4917.199 --> 4921.199
i get it i understand math like i

4919.44 --> 4922.799999999999
understand programming

4921.199 --> 4925.678999999999
i'm not a programmer i don't know

4922.8 --> 4927.6
actually how to do that but

4925.679 --> 4929.28
with like proper guidance of a

4927.6 --> 4931.04
programmer that would be extremely

4929.28 --> 4932.96
patient

4931.04 --> 4933.76
and i would have to be very inspired i

4932.96 --> 4936.8
could

4933.76 --> 4938.88
like quickly attain that level probably

4936.8 --> 4940.56
couldn't hold on to it though that's the

4938.88 --> 4943.28
big difference like a program is a

4940.56 --> 4944.96
program because they can always do that

4943.28 --> 4946.719
is second nature to them

4944.96 --> 4947.76
it's not going to become second nature

4946.719 --> 4950.719
to me

4947.76 --> 4953.360000000001
but i do understand what it is

4950.719 --> 4956.0
and in the same i understand what math

4953.36 --> 4958.0
is and geometry and how it works and why

4956.0 --> 4961.199
it works it's just that i'm not very

4958.0 --> 4964.0
good at formulas or

4961.199 --> 4964.0
that sort of thing

4966.4 --> 4971.9
i'm just all about pattern recognition

4968.56 --> 4974.96
and i do everything with that

4971.9 --> 4974.96
[Music]

4983.28 --> 4988.639
see ya what

4984.88 --> 4992.28
oh you're gonna go on nathan's panel

4988.639 --> 4992.28
it's already open

5008.96 --> 5011.96
hmm

5014.48 --> 5016.799999999999
okay

5018.08 --> 5022.8
well i was good enough at math in school

5021.36 --> 5026.239
in the sense that

5022.8 --> 5028.719
i did make the exam

5026.239 --> 5032.239
but i did it all on pattern recognition

5028.719 --> 5034.639
i basically cheated the entire purpose

5032.239 --> 5037.28
of like you have to understand it by

5034.639 --> 5037.28
just like

5037.52 --> 5042.400000000001
knowing

5038.8 --> 5045.360000000001
what patterns to expect

5042.4 --> 5047.599999999999
and that's how i actually got through it

5045.36 --> 5049.679
not by understanding it like

5047.6 --> 5051.6
technically i still don't understand

5049.679 --> 5052.96
like

5051.6 --> 5054.639
sign

5052.96 --> 5057.84
sin cosin

5054.639 --> 5057.84
that that

5058.0 --> 5062.4
i still have trouble fix putting that in

5060.08 --> 5064.88
my head even though that had to be like

5062.4 --> 5069.799999999999
standard knowledge for the exam

5064.88 --> 5069.8
and i got through it purely on intuition

5072.88 --> 5075.92
always baffled me

5078.88 --> 5084.1990000000005
but yeah i did also get art in school

5085.92 --> 5091.4800000000005
and i yeah spend a lot of energy on that

5088.48 --> 5091.48
too

5123.44 --> 5126.44
right

5128.96 --> 5132.2390000000005
so anyway i think i might be rounding

5130.88 --> 5134.639
out the show a little

5132.239 --> 5134.638999999999
early

5138.639 --> 5144.1990000000005
i did start pretty good

5140.56 --> 5144.1990000000005
pretty well on time

5167.36 --> 5171.92
hope i feel thanks

5169.28 --> 5174.92
i will it's just i think it's just the

5171.92 --> 5174.92
weather

5202.32 --> 5205.32
okay

5226.08 --> 5229.44
or maybe

5227.28 --> 5230.96
maybe it's could also be because of the

5229.44 --> 5233.839999999999
gusto drinks

5230.96 --> 5233.84
i'm realizing

5233.92 --> 5238.4
i mean i'm not used to drinking them as

5236.32 --> 5240.239
much as i do

5238.4 --> 5242.5599999999995
i've been drinking them like almost

5240.239 --> 5242.5599999999995
every

5242.719 --> 5245.36
every time

5244.639 --> 5248.159000000001
for

5245.36 --> 5250.639
over a week so

5248.159 --> 5252.96
maybe if i just stop doing that and just

5250.639 --> 5254.159000000001
stick to t

5252.96 --> 5255.28
i should

5254.159 --> 5258.159
test it

5255.28 --> 5258.159
as a variable

5261.05 --> 5264.159000000001
[Music]

5264.239 --> 5268.08
is there even sugar in there

5271.679 --> 5276.4
yeah there is technically also sugar in

5274.159 --> 5276.4
there

5277.6 --> 5281.0
or is it

5290.4 --> 5295.469999999999
i'm not sure it is kind of sweet

5293.28 --> 5296.719
i like it though

5295.47 --> 5298.719
[Music]

5296.719 --> 5302.6
but maybe it's just not really good for

5298.719 --> 5302.6
this type of weather either

5320.84 --> 5324.88
hmm right yeah logical conclusion yeah

5323.76 --> 5327.04
for me too

5324.88 --> 5329.76
for some reason

5327.04 --> 5332.08
just kind of tiresome

5329.76 --> 5332.08
weird

5333.36 --> 5338.639
the water contrast with before before

5336.639 --> 5341.04
this when the weather was better it was

5338.639 --> 5344.04
quite a stark contrast the experience of

5341.04 --> 5344.04
it

5350.48 --> 5356.919999999999
but i am looking forward to like

5352.88 --> 5356.92
beautiful summer weather

5392.639 --> 5395.639
um

5407.28 --> 5410.8
right so yeah i'm gonna run out the show

5409.52 --> 5415.96
guys

5410.8 --> 5415.96
i'm not being super energetic i am sorry

5420.56 --> 5424.639
but yeah it was always worth the shot

5422.159 --> 5425.839999999999
you know because it's happened plenty of

5424.639 --> 5427.679
times that i

5425.84 --> 5430.159000000001
start a show and i kind of feel like

5427.679 --> 5432.2390000000005
tired and bit disoriented but then like

5430.159 --> 5434.96
after half an hour or at least an hour i

5432.239 --> 5436.638999999999
get really full into it

5434.96 --> 5440.52
for some reason it doesn't really seem

5436.639 --> 5440.52
to be working right now

5449.12 --> 5453.5199999999995
oh thank you bobby stills yeah me too i

5451.679 --> 5455.84
hope

5453.52 --> 5457.1990000000005
and yeah for you too logical conclusion

5455.84 --> 5459.6
and all of you out there that are

5457.199 --> 5461.678999999999
feeling like weird

5459.6 --> 5464.719
influenced by the weather it'll get

5461.679 --> 5467.1990000000005
better eventually but

5464.719 --> 5467.199
it should

5467.36 --> 5472.32
alright so thanks everyone for coming

5470.56 --> 5474.159000000001
i hope you like this show even though

5472.32 --> 5475.28
might have been a bit slow

5474.159 --> 5477.28
or maybe

5475.28 --> 5478.8
it's the interaction with the chat that

5477.28 --> 5480.32
wasn't

5478.8 --> 5482.320000000001
