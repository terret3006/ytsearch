425.16 --> 433.24
man but my sleep is pretty rough like it

429.919 --> 433.24

God still loves you yeah of course he

467.24 --> 472.96000000000004

470.72 --> 477.03900000000004
rough morning but I mean somebody wants

472.96 --> 477.039
your pting that's awesome

482.96 --> 489.649
right so keep me updated about

486.42 --> 489.649
[Music]

497.919 --> 501.68
that all right so yeah

501.96 --> 511.28
yesterday watched back my show with Mark

506.479 --> 513.919
sergeant and it was great I mean

511.28 --> 516.159
that was a fun listen like I'd listen to

513.919 --> 516.159
that

516.399 --> 522.68
again it's just

519.519 --> 524.8
great although yeah one downside is that

522.68 --> 527.92
the viewing numbers are not like

524.8 --> 530.4799999999999
skyrocketing but I think it's because

527.92 --> 533.7199999999999
Mark Sergeant basically

530.48 --> 536.839
uploaded the the audio on his channel

533.72 --> 541.0400000000001
that one's getting plenty of

536.839 --> 543.399
views but for some reason

541.04 --> 546.76
my show is not getting like tons of

543.399 --> 550.56
views but it will probably still run

546.76 --> 550.56
up over the coming

551.959 --> 556.7199999999999
time I mean the views are decent

557.04 --> 561.959
287 but I mean compared to David Weiss

560.12 --> 565.04
it's at 8

561.959 --> 569.1199999999999
1.8k but I think it's because David just

565.04 --> 571.279
like keeps linking up my video for my

569.12 --> 573.76
channel Channel like he's he didn't

571.279 --> 577.4399999999999
upload it on his own channel I

573.76 --> 579.399
think so I I get people forwarded to

577.44 --> 583.32
that show and that's how I'm getting all

579.399 --> 583.32
these views that's what I suspect

592.2 --> 596.2
anyway right

596.77 --> 604.519
[Music]

609.92 --> 613.8389999999999
all right so I have no idea what I'm

611.279 --> 617.88
going to talk about

613.839 --> 617.8800000000001
today still trying to wake

621.6 --> 630.0400000000001
up yeah watch

624.8 --> 630.04
the info War Sunday stream

630.75 --> 633.83
[Music]

635.279 --> 637.88
that's about

640.76 --> 648.3199999999999
it actually wanted to watch the they

644.279 --> 652.12
live truth video had something

648.32 --> 654.6
about the fauland

652.12 --> 657.399
islands gateway to

654.6 --> 658.9590000000001
Antarctica which is kind of interesting

657.399 --> 661.24
I have no idea what that's going to be

658.959 --> 661.2399999999999
about

666.04 --> 671.279
I thought I was going to be partially

668.76 --> 673.48
about like there is a suspicion out

671.279 --> 677.68
there that

673.48 --> 680.6
there's not directly below Antarctica or

677.68 --> 684.8
below uh Argentina but

680.6 --> 688.24
that to the west of it that there might

684.8 --> 692.1999999999999
be another hidden island in the

688.24 --> 696.72
Pacific or maybe even a small

692.2 --> 696.72
continent that's like being kept off the

698.399 --> 703.44
map cuz I think there really is

700.639 --> 706.2
something there like when I've heard

703.44 --> 709.0
that just it felt

706.2 --> 714.36
like there probably

709.0 --> 717.24
is a hidden continent somewhere in the

714.36 --> 720.24
Pacific like somewhere west of South

717.24 --> 720.24
America

726.92 --> 731.16
and I'm kind of eager to hear more

729.36 --> 733.5600000000001
research about that

731.16 --> 735.88
too mean this is it's a really

733.56 --> 739.16
interesting thing dude I've been saying

735.88 --> 741.68
it like years ago even like yeah the

739.16 --> 745.12
Pacific is so

741.68 --> 748.76
big it it wouldn't be too hard

745.12 --> 749.8
to since there's not a lot of flight

748.76 --> 751.48
paths

749.8 --> 753.68
that are typically going to lead over

751.48 --> 757.44
the Pacific it's not going to be too

753.68 --> 761.279
hard to actually have if they're happens

757.44 --> 765.24
to be like a big island continent there

761.279 --> 765.24
to just completely leave it off the

770.639 --> 776.79
map is it just wonder wonder if that's

773.639 --> 779.809
going to happen

776.79 --> 779.809
[Music]

782.48 --> 786.72
yes Lucy level yeah that

786.839 --> 793.5600000000001
hello but yeah I think that that's

790.24 --> 796.519
probably what the uh video from they

793.56 --> 796.5189999999999
live truth is

807.16 --> 814.079
about 6 a.m. yeah good luck with that

810.44 --> 814.0790000000001
Moxy that that's not going to

826.88 --> 833.279
happen go

829.279 --> 833.279
gy no

838.31 --> 841.5
[Music]

845.56 --> 850.92
best part of the day no no I'm not going

847.639 --> 850.92
to give that a try at

853.32 --> 859.839
all no just going to bed a bit earlier

856.8 --> 859.8389999999999
would probably do

860.72 --> 867.72
it but I mean like after 12 it's like

864.36 --> 873.6
just really seducing to stay

867.72 --> 875.9200000000001
up temp is all nice and lots of

873.6 --> 879.8000000000001
stuff is

875.92 --> 883.079
on America's waking up and everything

879.8 --> 886.199
and so I just kind of need

883.079 --> 890.68
to resist that Temptation and just not

886.199 --> 890.68
go to bed so late that that would

898.04 --> 902.0
suffice for

938.48 --> 944.48
right also like on Netflix I'm I'm kind

941.639 --> 948.72
of like watching the Voyager Star Trek

944.48 --> 953.04
series again it's a it's a good

948.72 --> 959.8000000000001
series I'm just reanalyzing

953.04 --> 959.8
it and it is it is such a funny format

970.839 --> 975.9200000000001
right but yeah I'm just going to keep

973.16 --> 978.8389999999999
watching and and and eventually I will

975.92 --> 982.04
get back with an analysis about it like

978.839 --> 986.639
how is it how is it

982.04 --> 986.639
different what made it work

995.6 --> 1000.72
and just yeah again I noticed this

997.68 --> 1004.56
before but a lot again is that there's

1000.72 --> 1009.279
just so many like spiritual things that

1004.56 --> 1012.0
are kind of integrated into the lore of

1009.279 --> 1014.959
it what they're all doing especially

1012.0 --> 1020.0
like with chot and his

1014.959 --> 1023.1199999999999
Spirit traditions and all that

1020.0 --> 1023.12
[Music]

1027.4 --> 1032.64
and I bet that like a lot of Star Trek

1029.76 --> 1034.319
people kind of objected to all of that

1032.64 --> 1037.6000000000001
at the time because they were like H

1034.319 --> 1041.12
spiritual stuff is all nonsense and but

1037.6 --> 1041.12
they take it very serious

1046.799 --> 1051.799
here and that's kind of different from

1049.52 --> 1054.72
other Star Trek I mean it really is

1051.799 --> 1059.16
different like I don't remember ever

1054.72 --> 1062.0
having really seen other Star Treks that

1059.16 --> 1065.64
were like

1062.0 --> 1068.52
so spiritually educated like that and

1065.64 --> 1070.88
like had just conceptions of outer body

1068.52 --> 1074.96
experiences and afterlife and all that

1070.88 --> 1074.96
and it's all filled up with

1076.4 --> 1081.76
it and they give it proper for

1083.559 --> 1091.039
respect right anyway watching that again

1088.32 --> 1094.6
and yeah it's a good series I mean I

1091.039 --> 1097.24
have like the original special edition

1094.6 --> 1100.4399999999998
collection of the entire series for a

1097.24 --> 1103.159
reason cuz it was very infatuated when

1100.44 --> 1103.159
with it when I was

1106.32 --> 1113.0
younger and still kind of am I mean the

1109.4 --> 1113.0
characters in it are all very

1116.36 --> 1121.08
likable to me at least right

1130.039 --> 1135.64
anyway oh yeah oh of course yes Moxy

1133.679 --> 1137.76
that's very cute yeah if you completely

1135.64 --> 1140.72
change around your Rhythm yeah it's only

1137.76 --> 1144.559
the first month you're going to be

1140.72 --> 1146.48
sick and totally disrupted and have jet

1144.559 --> 1148.52
lag basically and then everything will

1146.48 --> 1151.3600000000001
be normal yeah that's that's really cute

1148.52 --> 1154.9189999999999
but I'm not going to do that

1151.36 --> 1154.9189999999999
though if you don't

1162.559 --> 1169.3999999999999
mind I mean good on you if you do that

1166.039 --> 1173.44
it does sound more healthy but uh

1169.4 --> 1173.44
you didn't say sick yeah no I said

1174.08 --> 1182.3999999999999
sick because that's probably what I feel

1178.88 --> 1183.96
like yeah 6:00 a.m. has never been a

1182.4 --> 1189.44
good time for me to get

1183.96 --> 1195.64
up and even when I had my weird like

1189.44 --> 1198.3200000000002
20 28 hour Rhythm for for

1195.64 --> 1201.2800000000002
months like yeah I'd get up then it

1198.32 --> 1203.4399999999998
certain points at 6:00 in the morning

1201.28 --> 1204.2
but I mean it still wouldn't feel good

1203.44 --> 1208.4
about

1204.2 --> 1208.4
it usually just feel

1210.76 --> 1217.64
tense and sweaty and all that and then

1213.64 --> 1220.3600000000001
eventually I just start becoming sleepy

1217.64 --> 1224.2800000000002
again it's just like

1220.36 --> 1227.4399999999998
no I tend to rest the

1224.28 --> 1230.2
best like in the morning that's just the

1227.44 --> 1232.76
way I work

1230.2 --> 1236.44
4 a.m. yoga

1232.76 --> 1236.44
Jesus okay wers

1242.48 --> 1249.559
boy

1244.52 --> 1249.559
right whatever does it for you

1252.17 --> 1255.219
[Music]

1285.24 --> 1288.24
ah

1289.039 --> 1294.679
right I'm wondering also though

1291.24 --> 1296.88
if if my sleeping issues might have some

1294.679 --> 1298.159
relation to just the amount of coffee

1296.88 --> 1300.6000000000001
that I'm drinking because I'm drinking

1298.159 --> 1302.72
more cof coffee than I usually

1300.6 --> 1305.9599999999998
do have been for a while because I've

1302.72 --> 1305.96
just been enjoying it so

1306.48 --> 1311.44
much like not having all the negative

1309.4 --> 1315.6000000000001
side effects to it as I'm kind of used

1311.44 --> 1317.52
to although I'm I'm kind of sure that

1315.6 --> 1321.4399999999998
eventually that stuff will come back and

1317.52 --> 1321.44
then I'll just have to cut myself off

1322.76 --> 1327.44
again

1324.52 --> 1329.8799999999999
man can't believe I'm still sweating

1327.44 --> 1334.1200000000001
even though I'm just in a

1329.88 --> 1334.1200000000001
t-shirt could be the coffee by the

1336.88 --> 1342.8400000000001
way what do you think about the solar

1340.12 --> 1346.039
flares and the

1342.84 --> 1348.1999999999998
auroras hey GEOS

1346.039 --> 1350.52
shifter good to see you man how you

1348.2 --> 1350.52
doing

1355.159 --> 1359.6000000000001
but yeah I mean borders boy what do I

1357.08 --> 1362.1589999999999
think about solar flares and the auroras

1359.6 --> 1365.1589999999999
well I talked about

1362.159 --> 1365.159
that

1368.24 --> 1375.1200000000001
yesterday or rather no uh Saturday I had

1372.559 --> 1378.48
a show where was pretty much talking

1375.12 --> 1378.4799999999998
about that

1380.0 --> 1383.52
about supposed solar

1384.0 --> 1387.6
flares like that's a

1389.36 --> 1396.7199999999998
claim but yeah rather the the sunspot

1393.679 --> 1399.679
activity and then

1396.72 --> 1401.64
correlating electromagnetic activity

1399.679 --> 1406.48
that tends

1401.64 --> 1406.48
to follow up on that kind of

1407.24 --> 1413.88
thing in including the Aurora Borealis

1411.48 --> 1417.32
expansion yeah still didn't see any by

woman about

1874.519 --> 1877.88
water what was

1878.32 --> 1883.799

1891.919 --> 1897.919
let's see if I can find it yeah blood

doesn't lie that

1898.08 --> 1903.8799999999999
video who's Mikey I don't know some

1902.12 --> 1906.4799999999998
supposed flat

1903.88 --> 1908.48
earther that also does live streams he

1906.48 --> 1911.44

1908.48 --> 1915.72
me a while ago but I mean he never got

1911.44 --> 1919.0
back to me so I don't

1915.72 --> 1923.24
know but he like reached out to me after

1919.0 --> 1923.24

for for

2027.679 --> 2030.679
h

2039.519 --> 2047.89
Mikey Smith yeah could

2041.58 --> 2047.8899999999999
[Music]

2051.399 --> 2057.04
be dude I even have like CC Chris

2057.119 --> 2062.0
over although he's kind of used to doing

2059.72 --> 2064.6389999999997
very short stream so I wonder if he'll

2062.0 --> 2067.359
like actually do a longer

2064.639 --> 2070.96
stream but I mean I've been following

2067.359 --> 2075.2
that guy guy for like a very long time

2070.96 --> 2075.2
he arguably has even more trolls than I

2096.44 --> 2099.64
do huh

2122.68 --> 2125.68
off

2129.28 --> 2131.8
Daniel

2135.839 --> 2143.04
Brett I would lose it with

2139.04 --> 2143.04
him I don't know why

2146.68 --> 2151.9199999999996
though but yeah I don't really see why

2149.079 --> 2151.92
i' have that guy

2152.119 --> 2157.359
on hello voy good to see you

2163.71 --> 2166.8
[Music]

2175.319 --> 2180.52
bit of a hot hat well yeah I can be a

2178.52 --> 2183.92
bit of a hot hat it's more like do you

2180.52 --> 2183.92
have an actual point to

2185.04 --> 2192.319
anything I've never seen Daniel Pratt

2188.839 --> 2195.88
actually make interesting

2192.319 --> 2198.88
structurally compelling Arguments for

2195.88 --> 2198.88
anything

2202.72 --> 2207.839
so I mean maybe you could tell me why I

2205.599 --> 2211.6400000000003
would have him on like what what would

2207.839 --> 2211.64
we be talking about

2218.76 --> 2224.7200000000003
some of the early videos from Daniel

2221.96 --> 2226.96
okay what were they about did they have

2224.72 --> 2226.9599999999996
a

2236.359 --> 2243.96
point yeah exactly GEOS shif so yeah

2239.64 --> 2243.96
there's no point in having him on

2260.24 --> 2264.68
yeah so not a good idea then

2276.69 --> 2282.88
[Music]

2305.48 --> 2308.48
ah

2326.2 --> 2331.4399999999996
all right yeah sorry guys if I seem a

2328.079 --> 2336.2000000000003
little slow just getting cooked here it

2331.44 --> 2336.2000000000003
is quite warm and moist

2354.96 --> 2359.0
but I'm getting there I'm I'm starting

2356.8 --> 2362.2400000000002
to wake up thanks to the coffee and all

2359.0 --> 2363.04
that and love to have discussion as soon

2362.24 --> 2368.52
as

2363.04 --> 2368.52
there's a good subject to dive into

2390.0 --> 2397.16
most of them said you okay well I bet

2393.839 --> 2398.88
there's a lot of flat earther YouTubers

2397.16 --> 2401.16
that are that don't really know what

2398.88 --> 2403.359
they're talking about too much they just

2401.16 --> 2405.839
kind of want to talk about it and just

2403.359 --> 2405.839
see what

2411.96 --> 2417.76
happens and hey in a way I'm kind of up

2414.48 --> 2417.76
for that as well but I

2420.079 --> 2425.96
mean Hello ik keaster guy

2437.76 --> 2443.0400000000004
explain why Flat Earth lost all momentum

2440.839 --> 2445.68
it well it didn't really lose all

2443.04 --> 2448.88
momentum it's just

2445.68 --> 2452.359
that the shock value of It kind of gone

2448.88 --> 2456.7200000000003
because people are aware now that it

2452.359 --> 2459.04
is a thing GE shifter I mean just check

2456.72 --> 2461.64
out my night owl show with the mark

2459.04 --> 2465.96
Sergeant we talked about this

2461.64 --> 2465.96
too it's just that everything's kind of

2472.63 --> 2478.17
[Music]

2476.16 --> 2481.3289999999997
changed huh

2478.17 --> 2481.329
[Music]

2495.87 --> 2501.52
[Music]

2498.56 --> 2501.52
censored and

2504.319 --> 2510.2
hidden well yeah git I mean if you're

2507.24 --> 2512.8799999999997
just going to like search for Flat Earth

2510.2 --> 2515.7599999999998
then you won't have like flat

2512.88 --> 2518.44
earthers pop up on the first

2515.76 --> 2519.76
page right you got to know them through

2518.44 --> 2522.88
other

2519.76 --> 2524.0
people it's like just figure out who's

2522.88 --> 2527.28
out

2524.0 --> 2531.28
there and then go directly to them so it

2527.28 --> 2531.28
is all basically word of mouth

2539.319 --> 2544.44
again right because like YouTube and

2542.599 --> 2546.599
Google they're only going to shove anti

2544.44 --> 2547.839
flat earthers in your face if you search

2546.599 --> 2550.04
on flat

2547.839 --> 2552.48
Earth

2550.04 --> 2556.88
so yeah you got to just kind of know

2552.48 --> 2556.88
they're out there and find

2573.4 --> 2582.6800000000003
them easy to find no no that's not it at

2577.92 --> 2582.6800000000003
all Moxy it's exactly the

2582.88 --> 2588.1600000000003
opposite yeah it's not easy to find and

2586.0 --> 2590.2
there is plenty of interest there just

2588.16 --> 2593.44
it's not easy to

2590.2 --> 2595.96
find yeah they

2593.44 --> 2600.559
gated the search

2595.96 --> 2600.559
results it's been going on for

2602.24 --> 2611.24
years yeah so you you can take that back

2606.16 --> 2611.24
yeah it's not easy to find and there is

2615.8 --> 2620.079
interest you found us all yeah I'm sure

2618.44 --> 2624.48
you

2620.079 --> 2627.4
did but Moxy you were all well aware of

2624.48 --> 2631.72
our existence way before they started

2627.4 --> 2636.96
gating the flat earthers on YouTube

2631.72 --> 2636.9599999999996
so that's baloney yeah you're baloney

2639.52 --> 2645.28
yeah Ju Just Give It Up yeah there is

2642.2 --> 2648.48
interest to Flat Earth plenty from other

2645.28 --> 2652.2400000000002
flat earthers alone yeah and they're not

2648.48 --> 2657.119
easy to find yeah they were easy to find

2652.24 --> 2660.839
5 years ago six years ago they're not

2657.119 --> 2665.28
anymore so you can stop fooling yourself

2660.839 --> 2665.2799999999997
now because you ain't fooling us

2675.48 --> 2681.28
more like 10 years ago

2678.24 --> 2684.52
yeah no but I mean the real gatekeeping

2681.28 --> 2684.52
started like around

2684.559 --> 2687.559
200

2690.88 --> 2699.2400000000002
17 18 19 somewhere over

2695.68 --> 2703.24
there n yeah

2699.24 --> 2703.24
yeah Moxy

2739.52 --> 2744.079
yeah now a clutch I

2741.64 --> 2746.2799999999997
mean that doesn't work like that you

2744.079 --> 2749.559
can't

2746.28 --> 2751.0
just negate Flat Earth with arguments

2749.559 --> 2755.88
that's the whole

2751.0 --> 2755.88
point like it never works

2758.92 --> 2761.6800000000003
you have to

2763.4 --> 2769.119
effectively bribe a flat

2766.319 --> 2771.5589999999997
earther to allow you

2769.119 --> 2775.8
to seem to

2771.559 --> 2775.8
win as a baller you

2776.079 --> 2782.079
do cuz if you let the flat earther just

2779.04 --> 2784.4
make a full case like there's nothing

2782.079 --> 2786.76
left there's nothing left but just

2784.4 --> 2790.359
scatter gunning and having a tantrum for

2786.76 --> 2790.3590000000004
B and that's what they end up

2792.119 --> 2799.0
doing all right it looks bad looks bad

2795.16 --> 2801.72
for the Ballers and that's why it's more

2799.0 --> 2804.8
effective statistically to just like

2801.72 --> 2807.68
just put it all in the background just

2804.8 --> 2811.88
make people not find it unless they're

2807.68 --> 2811.8799999999997
specifically looking for it

2824.0 --> 2828.96
yeah [Â __Â ]

2825.44 --> 2831.28
sey that's absolute [Â __Â ] yeah the

2828.96 --> 2833.92
censorship medical censorship that

2831.28 --> 2839.8390000000004
happened

2833.92 --> 2839.839
after after the Flat Earth

2853.359 --> 2858.22
how many flat earthers would you gu be

2855.48 --> 2859.359
out there uh well when it comes to

2858.22 --> 2861.359
[Music]

2859.359 --> 2864.7999999999997
streamers

2861.359 --> 2867.0
hundreds but they're not necessarily all

2864.8 --> 2868.52
very interesting but there are hundreds

2867.0 --> 2871.319
out

2868.52 --> 2875.119
there just in their own little camps

2871.319 --> 2875.119
doing their own thing

2885.24 --> 2891.68
let no have to know there are plenty

2889.16 --> 2891.68
speaking

2892.44 --> 2897.52
out it's just way more than we're let on

2896.04 --> 2901.839
I

2897.52 --> 2901.839
mean even like 5 years

2901.92 --> 2908.04
ago Mark Sergeant would like talk about

2904.72 --> 2910.7599999999998
it that there is like tons of them and

2908.04 --> 2913.2799999999997
they just never heard of anybody

2910.76 --> 2916.119
else like they just sit in their own

2913.28 --> 2918.0
Camp do their own thing and they're just

2916.119 --> 2919.7200000000003
not even aware that there's other

2918.0 --> 2922.2
channels out there that have been doing

2919.72 --> 2922.2
it for

2923.359 --> 2928.4
years there will still be people out

2925.96 --> 2931.799
there that will have been doing flat

2928.4 --> 2937.2400000000002
earth related streams for like eight

2931.799 --> 2937.24
years that we have never even heard

2937.599 --> 2943.76
like things like the Flat Earth debate

2939.48 --> 2943.76
or the or my Channel

2944.799 --> 2950.24
or or all these other things they just

2947.559 --> 2952.88
completely separately do their thing and

2950.24 --> 2956.24
they might vaguely hear know about

2952.88 --> 2960.6600000000003
certain people bigger

2956.24 --> 2963.8599999999997
channels but they don't know the rest

2960.66 --> 2963.8599999999997
[Music]

2972.799 --> 2976.599
small group compared to people

2974.839 --> 2979.0789999999997
understand but not talk about

2976.599 --> 2982.0
it yeah I mean

2979.079 --> 2983.52
General people that understand about

2982.0 --> 2985.04
Flat Earth and not are going to not

2983.52 --> 2987.28
going to talk about yeah we don't know

2985.04 --> 2991.2799999999997
exactly how big that number is but it's

2987.28 --> 2991.28
going to be pretty vast

2997.44 --> 3004.599
Glover channels covering flat

3000.319 --> 3004.599
Earth what the hell are you talking

3010.76 --> 3014.4
about hey blue pill

3015.319 --> 3018.68
Evolution hell

3022.119 --> 3030.4
jug videos it's saying before they got

3025.72 --> 3034.64
purged yeah but I mean the whole medical

3030.4 --> 3037.359
Purge like tons and

3034.64 --> 3040.44
tons of flat earthers that were doing

3037.359 --> 3043.64
regular videos about

3040.44 --> 3045.2000000000003
it they were hopping on board and just

3043.64 --> 3047.839
like oh we're going to talk about the

3045.2 --> 3049.9199999999996
medical stuff now and yeah they got

3047.839 --> 3052.48
kicked

3049.92 --> 3056.7200000000003
out because they all latched onto it

3052.48 --> 3056.72
it's it was almost like a trap

3057.2 --> 3062.7599999999998
and a lot of them took

3059.2 --> 3066.319
debate huge amounts of people like a

3062.76 --> 3066.3190000000004
majority that's just what

3068.4 --> 3072.96
happened right because they were like oh

3070.599 --> 3076.2000000000003
the new subject this is all the hot new

3072.96 --> 3077.76
thing and so yeah and then they do that

3076.2 --> 3079.7599999999998
and then they get kicked off and then

3077.76 --> 3082.7990000000004
they end up complaining about oh I got

3079.76 --> 3082.7990000000004
censored like

3082.92 --> 3089.559
yeah what the hell did you

3177.119 --> 3183.2000000000003
around and he's covered pretty high

3179.68 --> 3183.2

3316.76 --> 3321.92
sensoring I don't think so Z Happ be

3319.64 --> 3327.359
that shadow sensoring thing is happening

3321.92 --> 3327.359
on all the platforms all of it

3332.68 --> 3339.1189999999997
only like the very very young new ones

3335.839 --> 3341.799
that don't have that then certain people

3339.119 --> 3344.92
basically start to exponentially explode

3341.799 --> 3347.68
on them and then it gets

3344.92 --> 3350.4
transformed it gets subjected to by the

3347.68 --> 3353.839
same type of algorithm that then gate

3350.4 --> 3358.1600000000003
keeps everything exactly like all other

3746.44 --> 3751.279
bolar troll and I don't even know why I

3748.96 --> 3755.319
have him around other than that he's

3751.279 --> 3757.96
been kind of moderately well behaved

3755.319 --> 3762.839
recently but uh I mean it looks like

3757.96 --> 3765.92
he's going to make a another go for

3762.839 --> 3768.7599999999998
trollish with this

3765.92 --> 3772.4
[Â __Â ] so keep it up Moxy and I will just

whatever

3806.0 --> 3810.16
it's all

3807.4 --> 3814.0
gross talking like that is gross that's

3810.16 --> 3817.2
I guess I just don't see that

3814.0 --> 3821.68
anymore CU I'm not like a pervert that

3817.2 --> 3821.68
just only thinks about sex all the

3824.359 --> 3830.7599999999998
time the jokes are not my strong point

3827.279 --> 3837.72
oh no no they're not your strong point

3830.76 --> 3837.7200000000003
Moxy your jokes are gross and lame bad

3838.0 --> 3843.559
timed and

3839.92 --> 3847.2400000000002
usually following up something you said

3843.559 --> 3849.0
that was utterly wrong where you don't

3847.24 --> 3851.799
give recognition to your wrong and then

3849.0 --> 3855.039
you try to move on try to distract

3851.799 --> 3859.64
everybody with a really lame

3855.039 --> 3859.6400000000003
joke yeah it doesn't

3862.0 --> 3867.72
work so why didn't you start pointing at

3864.96 --> 3867.7200000000003
yourself there

3878.58 --> 3881.659
[Music]

3885.59 --> 3888.699
[Music]

3894.64 --> 3898.68
yeah for

3905.1 --> 3913.949
[Music]

3953.52 --> 3961.2
how about that Flat Earth

3957.0 --> 3961.2
yeah yeah yeah no definitely

3973.16 --> 3977.359
flat outer space is

3981.839 --> 3987.72
fake gas would expand in all directions

3985.039 --> 3989.48
in order to fill the available volume

3987.72 --> 3993.279
with

3989.48 --> 3993.279
unprecedented explosive

3994.96 --> 4001.68
force yeah that explosive force being

3998.72 --> 4005.48
proportional to the available

4001.68 --> 4007.3999999999996
volume in which the gas can

4005.48 --> 4011.4
expand and

4007.4 --> 4011.4
so definitely no outer

4013.079 --> 4018.279
space no evidence of Earth

4016.039 --> 4020.7200000000003
actually being

4018.279 --> 4022.72
spherical other than presuppose it's

4020.72 --> 4025.2
spherical and that's the reason why you

4022.72 --> 4028.68
see the stars and the planets and

4025.2 --> 4028.68
everything around

4030.319 --> 4037.92
you right that that's all there is

4034.48 --> 4040.44
really for the

4037.92 --> 4044.4
ball just miss understand what you're

4040.44 --> 4047.48
seeing don't be honest about it apply

4044.4 --> 4049.4
maximum physical assumption bias and

4047.48 --> 4052.52
then just assume

4049.4 --> 4055.559
that you have to be right and that's why

4052.52 --> 4055.559
things are the way they

4061.52 --> 4067.44
are just assume it's a globe and that's

4064.119 --> 4067.44
how it works

4089.599 --> 4093.92
how was that think I wasn't wrong well

4091.68 --> 4097.44
I'm not talking about that particular

4093.92 --> 4099.4
case Moxy and good on you good on you

4097.44 --> 4102.3189999999995
for actually just being able to admit

4099.4 --> 4106.759
that you're wrong right there's no

4102.319 --> 4106.759
direct risk for your own religion

4106.92 --> 4112.4400000000005
right that's brave enough that you that

4109.279 --> 4114.56
you're still willing to just admit that

4112.44 --> 4117.199
you might be wrong about social matters

4114.56 --> 4119.799
about something about a person it's very

4117.199 --> 4123.839
brave of you I know doesn't work like

4119.799 --> 4126.839
that when it comes to your Globe Faith

4123.839 --> 4126.839
argumentation

4134.44 --> 4138.4

definitely will keep doing that then

4172.239 --> 4175.239
Moxy

4189.92 --> 4194.4400000000005
definitely all right anyhow hope you're

4192.44 --> 4197.24
all enjoying the show if you are don't

4194.44 --> 4200.58

oh yeah sure you can zap tappy

4288.159 --> 4295.5599999999995
yeah you're not fooling

4291.679 --> 4297.49
anybody like nobody you're a Ballard you

4295.56 --> 4298.84
have been for years there's

4297.49 --> 4301.719
[Music]

4298.84 --> 4304.76
no there's nothing that could change

4301.719 --> 4307.719
that at this point

4304.76 --> 4311.04
nothing yeah keep telling yourself that

4307.719 --> 4312.04
oh you only need one evidence oh yes of

4311.04 --> 4317.159
course

4312.04 --> 4320.639
except I don't know natural law

4317.159 --> 4324.159
black one observations all that I mean

4320.639 --> 4327.400000000001
you're very content to just hold on to

4324.159 --> 4328.839999999999
provable mathematical based machinations

4327.4 --> 4330.5599999999995
that presuppose the Earth being

4328.84 --> 4333.2390000000005
spherical ignore

4330.56 --> 4335.719
perspective all those things you're just

4333.239 --> 4338.599999999999
very eager to hold on to that but you

4335.719 --> 4341.88
need evidence that it's flat though

4338.6 --> 4344.04
right yes sure you do yeah you're not

4341.88 --> 4345.88
fooling anybody you might be fooling

4344.04 --> 4348.88
yourself

4345.88 --> 4348.88
but you're not fooling

4350.719 --> 4358.84
us yeah there is no Edge and there's no

4355.8 --> 4361.12
evidence that a d might be touching down

4358.84 --> 4365.08
to

4361.12 --> 4365.08
earth yeah and it wouldn't need

4366.8 --> 4373.88
to all that there needs to be is an

4369.88 --> 4373.88
available volume

4380.199 --> 4383.589999999999
yes blue pill Evolution you know all

4382.4 --> 4386.789
about how that

4383.59 --> 4386.789
[Music]

4387.4 --> 4393.4
works holographic assumption bias that's

4390.719 --> 4393.4
absolute

4398.719 --> 4404.6
nonsense there's no holographic

4401.28 --> 4405.759999999999
assumption bias that's a really stupid

4404.6 --> 4409.84
madeup

4405.76 --> 4412.6
childish thing to say yeah not based on

4409.84 --> 4415.52
psychology at

4412.6 --> 4418.04
all that nobody has a holographic

4415.52 --> 4421.679
assumption bias people assume things are

4418.04 --> 4424.04
physical when they see it that's real

4421.679 --> 4426.159
that's the actual traceable internal

4424.04 --> 4427.719
processes that can be communicated yeah

4426.159 --> 4432.599999999999
people don't assume when they see

4427.719 --> 4437.0
something it's a hologram so that's just

4432.6 --> 4440.1990000000005
[Â __Â ] just like oh oh it's not good

4437.0 --> 4443.96
for the ball so we're going to just like

4440.199 --> 4443.96
try to flip around whatever you

4444.0 --> 4450.199
say and then just accuse you of the same

4448.08 --> 4454.04
thing even though that doesn't actually

4450.199 --> 4456.04
contextually make any goddamn sense yeah

4454.04 --> 4459.04
don't try your stupid little tricks on

4456.04 --> 4459.04
me

4466.639 --> 4471.159000000001
took you to space to see for yourself

4469.199 --> 4475.839999999999
yeah you never experienced that nobody

4471.159 --> 4478.48
has ever experienced that nobody so yeah

4475.84 --> 4481.4400000000005
hey look if they just put you in a

4478.48 --> 4485.638999999999
teleporter and teleport you to that

4481.44 --> 4488.759999999999
secret base on Mars right or on the moon

4485.639 --> 4492.159000000001
of Saturn then you'll see that it's all

4488.76 --> 4495.4800000000005
real yeah yeah except that doesn't exist

4492.159 --> 4497.759999999999
though yeah so maybe conjure up more

4495.48 --> 4499.839999999999
hypothetical situations that are

4497.76 --> 4503.0
definitely not

4499.84 --> 4506.2390000000005
real to to back your point on like yeah

4503.0 --> 4508.76
we only need this hypothetical situation

4506.239 --> 4512.239
that's never happened except in movies

4508.76 --> 4515.0
to prove that it's real yeah yeah we

4512.239 --> 4517.04
know we know you need your science

4515.0 --> 4518.48
fiction to be real to prove that it's

4517.04 --> 4522.88
real we

4518.48 --> 4526.959999999999
know it's not real though you don't have

4522.88 --> 4526.96
such evidence nobody does

4541.159 --> 4546.28
shift I tried to make a teleporter one

4543.679 --> 4549.96
time and put my garage on

4546.28 --> 4554.759999999999
fire that's lucky that it didn't

4549.96 --> 4554.76
just blow it all up

4580.679 --> 4590.08
what wildfires already in Canada again

4585.6 --> 4590.08
but I thought it it had just stopped

4601.84 --> 4609.28
raining doesn't huge wildfires actually

4605.84 --> 4609.28
require a drought

4609.88 --> 4614.400000000001
period I don't get it

4626.28 --> 4631.92
what would convince you of it being a

4628.239 --> 4636.44
globe nothing it isn't a

4631.92 --> 4638.719
globe evidence for a globe that's actual

4636.44 --> 4641.4
evidence would convince me that it's a

4638.719 --> 4643.52
globe that evidence doesn't exist yeah

4641.4 --> 4648.04
you won't be able to find

4643.52 --> 4648.040000000001
it and won't be able to name

4648.159 --> 4653.599999999999
it cuz it doesn't

4651.159 --> 4657.239
exist yeah it's plenty of things we

4653.6 --> 4658.320000000001
could make up what it would be like and

4657.239 --> 4660.4
it's

4658.32 --> 4664.759999999999
not Earth is

4660.4 --> 4664.759999999999
flat contained

4673.84 --> 4679.04
stationary oh I'm In Too Deep yeah I'm

4676.36 --> 4683.28
too deep into actual

4679.04 --> 4685.96
evidence that's right I'm too deep into

4683.28 --> 4688.84
logical physics based

4685.96 --> 4690.88
argumentation I know I'm I'm In Too Deep

4688.84 --> 4694.400000000001
of the knowledge of what is real and

4690.88 --> 4696.88
what isn't yeah you can't convince me of

4694.4 --> 4700.719
a nonsensical science fiction reality

4696.88 --> 4700.719
anymore that's right

4731.6 --> 4734.6
h

4748.44 --> 4753.879999999999
yeah that sucks clutch but I mean that's

4750.639 --> 4757.159000000001
like really strangely early

4753.88 --> 4762.2390000000005
though like how is it all even

4757.159 --> 4766.719
burning when like it's the dry season

4762.239 --> 4766.718999999999

4907.04 --> 4911.199
just the the dead wood lying around

4909.639 --> 4914.0
already that that's going to dry up

4911.199 --> 4916.28
relatively quick I get it I don't see

4914.0 --> 4918.4
though why people aren't just collecting

4916.28 --> 4920.599999999999
it

4918.4 --> 4922.08
though like oh the government's going to

4920.6 --> 4924.88
lay it around

4922.08 --> 4927.719
what's what's stopping people from just

4924.88 --> 4930.679
like getting a

4927.719 --> 4933.44
cart and just go in the forest and just

4930.679 --> 4937.8
collect tons of that dry wood that they

4933.44 --> 4937.799999999999
can then use for themselves

4949.76 --> 4952.92
can't take

4955.84 --> 4959.2390000000005
what what the

4966.12 --> 4972.84
hell yeah so BL yes spell check just

4970.48 --> 4976.919999999999
don't do

4972.84 --> 4976.92
that don't don't call me

4977.84 --> 4985.679
Arvin yeah just turn your spell check

4980.639 --> 4985.679
off then it's very annoying don't do

4987.36 --> 4994.88
that same in EU that's total

4991.76 --> 4998.719
nonsense like who the hell even

4994.88 --> 4998.719
like cares about

4999.4 --> 5005.0
that like if I needed some dead dry wood

5003.84 --> 5006.88
I would l

5005.0 --> 5009.76
just go and get it like who the hell's

5006.88 --> 5011.92
going to stop me I mean if I did it on

5009.76 --> 5015.2390000000005
an industrial scale that that would be

5011.92 --> 5017.679
one thing but I mean nobody cares if you

5015.239 --> 5021.759999999999
just go out and you collect a bunch of

5017.679 --> 5021.76
dead wood that's just lying on the

5033.44 --> 5046.169

5094.84 --> 5098.360000000001
even going to

5096.239 --> 5100.239
last I mean if you're part of

5098.36 --> 5102.48
conservation and you're just doing that

5100.239 --> 5104.119
to people while not properly managing

5102.48 --> 5106.119
the land like how long is it going to

5104.119 --> 5108.28
take before you're just going to find

5106.119 --> 5111.04
yourself having been shot by a

5108.28 --> 5113.08
sniper like oh you're conserving the

5111.04 --> 5116.36
land are

5113.08 --> 5119.0
you sounds like you're partially

5116.36 --> 5121.799999999999
responsible for all these wildfires that

5119.0 --> 5124.36
are happening because of your

5121.8 --> 5126.400000000001
negligence oh oh you were ordered to be

5124.36 --> 5127.299999999999
negligent well yeah you shouldn't be

5126.4 --> 5130.339
taking those

5127.3 --> 5130.339

5159.159 --> 5162.839999999999

evil and it needs to

mismanagement under penalty of

5302.36 --> 5309.36
incarceration and all that and have he

5304.56 --> 5312.92
finds that's not funny it's [Â __Â ] evil

5309.36 --> 5314.679
it cannot be justified logically it is

5312.92 --> 5317.639
pure

5314.679 --> 5320.639
besiegement Siege evil that's what it is

5317.639 --> 5322.6
and it would require like pretty severe

5320.639 --> 5326.32
punishment to rectify

5322.6 --> 5328.320000000001
that towards the ones that are putting

5326.32 --> 5330.08
it like that that are setting these

5328.32 --> 5332.759999999999
parameters that are setting these rules

5330.08 --> 5336.04
they need to be

5332.76 --> 5336.04
incarcerated at

5343.84 --> 5350.52
minimum yeah systematic purposeful

5347.88 --> 5354.52
mismanagement is not funny it's

5350.52 --> 5354.52
incredibly evil

5369.239 --> 5375.04
talking about stuff from forest

5372.32 --> 5377.48
yeah it's not only there though but I

5375.04 --> 5380.84
mean it is apparently there as well

5377.48 --> 5380.839999999999
that's incredibly

5393.04 --> 5397.0
evil for

5427.8 --> 5431.6
all right GE shifter thanks for being

5434.639 --> 5439.4800000000005
here good to see you again have a nice

5449.0 --> 5454.36
day all right don't forget the Rogan it

5451.36 --> 5454.36
up

5456.8 --> 5461.719
oh have I seen more terrible news out

5459.6 --> 5464.56
there yeah I heard more terrible news

5461.719 --> 5467.56
out there how about not escalating this

5464.56 --> 5467.56
crap

5509.679 --> 5514.88
a pro protest dud I don't know what the

5512.96 --> 5517.32
[Â __Â ] you're talking about but everything

5514.88 --> 5521.08
in Germany is absolutely horrendous it's

5517.32 --> 5523.44
like one of the most evil Communist

5521.08 --> 5526.5199999999995
governments that the world has ever seen

5523.44 --> 5530.0
I mean the level of

5526.52 --> 5535.2390000000005
evil of the German government is like

5530.0 --> 5538.92
way way worse than Nazi Germany like

5535.239 --> 5538.919999999999
several factors

5540.88 --> 5548.6
worse it is totally evil

5545.679 --> 5552.6
Psychopathic and like they don't have

5548.6 --> 5555.6
any sense of values about

5552.6 --> 5560.56
anything everything they say is a lie

5555.6 --> 5560.56
it's like just nonsense

5562.119 --> 5567.92
context yeah oh conservation of nature

5565.0 --> 5571.4
but destroy all of that nature for some

5567.92 --> 5575.56
stupid pointless short-term goal

5571.4 --> 5578.44
though yeah they're prioritizing like oh

5575.56 --> 5580.6
we need environmentally friendly power

5578.44 --> 5583.5599999999995
generation even though it's absolutely

5580.6 --> 5585.84
provably not environmentally friendly at

5583.56 --> 5588.639
all but because they have to do it

5585.84 --> 5591.8
they'll destroy like very precious

5588.639 --> 5595.0
ancient unrestorable

5591.8 --> 5598.04
nature just to achieve a

5595.0 --> 5600.239
stupid durable energy that's not even

5598.04 --> 5603.76
really durable and they'll do that yeah

5600.239 --> 5606.5199999999995
that that's this world now it's anti-v

5603.76 --> 5609.84
environmentalism

5606.52 --> 5612.639
environmentalism and it's unbelievably

5609.84 --> 5615.96
evil and those people that do that just

5612.639 --> 5615.96
need to be [Â __Â ]

5619.239 --> 5623.4
tortured with hot iron

5623.6 --> 5628.320000000001
pokers and Cattle prods

5649.84 --> 5656.88
a bit medieval hey they're Neo

5654.159 --> 5659.879999999999
feudal yeah when you're Neo feudal when

5656.88 --> 5661.4800000000005
you're that antihuman that anti

5659.88 --> 5665.679
everything that's

5661.48 --> 5669.119
good then there needs to be a Savage

5665.679 --> 5670.4800000000005
Savage level punishment for that that is

5669.119 --> 5673.88
so

5670.48 --> 5675.799999999999
horrendous that nobody would even think

5673.88 --> 5677.8
of trying to pull something like that

5675.8 --> 5680.8
ever

5677.8 --> 5680.8
again

5682.56 --> 5688.84
yeah cuz their treachery isn't just

5685.679 --> 5691.56
towards one group it's a treachery to

5688.84 --> 5693.119000000001
everything it's a treachery to mankind

5691.56 --> 5695.159000000001
it's a treachery to Nature it's a

5693.119 --> 5698.0
treachery to God it's a treachery to

5695.159 --> 5699.879999999999
truth it's a treachery to logic it is a

5698.0 --> 5703.6
full spectrum

5699.88 --> 5706.6
treachery and it requires maximum

5703.6 --> 5706.6
conceivable

5707.199 --> 5713.239
punishment maximum conceivable

5710.239 --> 5713.239
punishment

5745.92 --> 5749.719
yeah I don't know what the [Â __Â ]

5747.239 --> 5752.119
debatable D is talking

5749.719 --> 5754.52
about it just sounds like you're just

5752.119 --> 5757.0
trying to shove all the this stuff in my

5754.52 --> 5760.52
feet like I want to do all this stuff

5757.0 --> 5764.76
like I I want to I'm such a sadist I

5760.52 --> 5767.84
just want to do no no no it is necessary

5764.76 --> 5773.679
I don't want to do

5767.84 --> 5773.679
that but there needs to be a proper

5775.84 --> 5780.400000000001
deterrent there needs to be something

5778.119 --> 5782.88
that snaps these people that think they

5780.4 --> 5786.719
can get away with this to snap them out

5782.88 --> 5786.719
of it that's what needs to

5806.44 --> 5810.48
happen what would be a good alternative

5809.679 --> 5813.84
to

5810.48 --> 5817.638999999999
governments uh government how about a

5813.84 --> 5821.92
government that just does what they say

5817.639 --> 5828.4400000000005
they do and do it effectively and make

5821.92 --> 5828.4400000000005
sure that as many people are pleased as

5829.88 --> 5835.04
possible yeah how about governments just

5832.6 --> 5837.320000000001
do their job and stop acting like a

5835.04 --> 5841.199
freaking

5837.32 --> 5844.199
Empire stop acting like humans are

5841.199 --> 5844.199
cattle

5859.639 --> 5863.28
oh you think I don't give a [Â __Â ] what

5861.76 --> 5866.280000000001
you think saw

5863.28 --> 5866.28
blade

5869.0 --> 5873.08
yeah I mean you can't even turn off your

5871.4 --> 5876.08
spell correction why would I care what

5873.08 --> 5876.08
you have to say about

5881.599 --> 5890.96
it yeah and this is about a proper

5887.719 --> 5895.08
suited Tinker Tailor punishment for

5890.96 --> 5895.08
people that do these

5895.84 --> 5904.599
things that plan these obvious

5900.48 --> 5907.119
evils and use lies as a context for

5904.599 --> 5908.08
those evils yeah there needs to be a

5907.119 --> 5910.839999999999
fitting

5908.08 --> 5913.28
punishment can't just like oh regular

5910.84 --> 5916.04
rules and oh they get a bit of a fine no

5913.28 --> 5919.199
no they need to like really feel

5916.04 --> 5923.44
it they need to get a proper punishment

5919.199 --> 5923.44
for what they've been doing

5941.48 --> 5945.799999999999
yeah if you're in any position of power

5944.76 --> 5948.4400000000005
or

5945.8 --> 5952.1990000000005
management and you're an anti-human

5948.44 --> 5957.598999999999
sadist then you should be

5952.199 --> 5957.598999999999
punished to a maximum

5959.08 --> 5964.199
degree right otherwise if you don't do

5962.32 --> 5965.96
that if you just get away with it well

5964.199 --> 5968.919999999999
guess what's going to happen more people

5965.96 --> 5970.96
that are like hm I want to abuse power

5968.92 --> 5974.119
like that I want to be in complete and

5970.96 --> 5975.92
utter control and just lie and do

5974.119 --> 5978.5599999999995
exactly the opposite of what what they

5975.92 --> 5980.84
said and get away with it I want to do

5978.56 --> 5984.679
that too a whole new generations of

5980.84 --> 5989.599
people will just line up and do exactly

5984.679 --> 5992.08
that unless you savagely punish those

5989.599 --> 5992.08
kinds of

5992.159 --> 5998.839999999999
actions yeah that's the bloody reality

5996.56 --> 5998.84
about

5999.119 --> 6004.36
it yeah the more you let criminals get

6001.84 --> 6005.96
away with it well the more criminals

6004.36 --> 6011.44
you're going to

6005.96 --> 6011.44
get yeah that's the

6012.92 --> 6016.679
reality you need a

6022.32 --> 6028.45
deterrent for

6025.36 --> 6028.45

6104.48 --> 6108.36
so now we got a title

6120.44 --> 6123.119
I don't

6125.48 --> 6131.119
yeah yeah wanting retribution like I

6128.88 --> 6134.400000000001
just want it to

6131.119 --> 6137.4
stop I want people that could

6134.4 --> 6139.879999999999
potentially like doing that [Â __Â ] to

6137.4 --> 6143.598999999999
other people from within government I

6139.88 --> 6145.96
want that that impulse that arises in

6143.599 --> 6147.76
them to become like that I want it to be

6145.96 --> 6151.56
snuffed

6147.76 --> 6155.119000000001
out before they can turn into such a

6151.56 --> 6157.56
person and then because of that deserve

6155.119 --> 6160.28
that punishment yeah I just want that

6157.56 --> 6162.639
cycle to stop in order to stop that

6160.28 --> 6164.239
cycle you got to take the people that

6162.639 --> 6166.84
are at the

6164.239 --> 6169.638999999999
point of making that sort of thing

6166.84 --> 6171.76
happen and encouraging others to join

6169.639 --> 6175.639
them in doing that kind of thing they

6171.76 --> 6178.76
need to be Savage Bally

6175.639 --> 6180.639
punished and so that everybody can see

6178.76 --> 6184.96
that what's happened to them so

6180.639 --> 6184.96
everybody can Zone in on their

6186.599 --> 6192.28
pain yeah so that everybody knows like

6189.28 --> 6196.92
oh oh oh you want to try something like

6192.28 --> 6200.639
that yeah it's it's more than just oh

6196.92 --> 6202.92
you get hung for treason oh yeah well

6200.639 --> 6204.52
that's not good enough that's not good

6202.92 --> 6208.599
enough

6204.52 --> 6210.360000000001
enough yeah cuz they'll probably take it

6208.599 --> 6213.32
and think like well as long as I can

6210.36 --> 6215.48
just postpone that moment I can just

6213.32 --> 6218.32
like get away with so

6215.48 --> 6222.48
much so just

6218.32 --> 6222.48
death is not enough of a

6228.4 --> 6233.719
deterrent yeah Devils that possess

6232.08 --> 6239.239
people

6233.719 --> 6239.2390000000005
don't care if those they possess

6247.36 --> 6255.598999999999
die but if you make it really incredibly

6252.44 --> 6258.48
painful and let it be seen by others

6255.599 --> 6260.4400000000005
make it public yeah I mean why do you

6258.48 --> 6263.159
think in medieval times they did that

6260.44 --> 6265.44
kind of stuff publicly

6263.159 --> 6269.239
and not in some basement they did it

6265.44 --> 6272.44
publicly to set an example so that

6269.239 --> 6274.36
people who had similar ideas just

6272.44 --> 6276.48
happening naturally and them like oh

6274.36 --> 6280.239
yeah we could do this that they could

6276.48 --> 6283.0
see like what actually happens when you

6280.239 --> 6286.0
give into that devil spirit that could

6283.0 --> 6290.04
eventually take you

6286.0 --> 6292.599
over yeah so that when it hasn't fully

6290.04 --> 6296.84
taken you over you and your Human Side

6292.599 --> 6296.84
could still be like ah I don't want

6298.08 --> 6304.119
that like I'll just stick to trying to

6301.28 --> 6307.28
be a good human it's it's

6304.119 --> 6309.08
tougher but I mean at least it won't end

6307.28 --> 6312.48
up like

6309.08 --> 6315.48
that right it makes it not worth the

6312.48 --> 6315.48
risk

6322.47 --> 6325.56
[Music]

6350.599 --> 6354.92
it's the only language they understand

6357.32 --> 6363.36
right because all the other methods J

6359.76 --> 6363.360000000001
all the other language is

6365.08 --> 6368.08
just

6369.679 --> 6376.2390000000005
yeah it's

6371.92 --> 6376.2390000000005
just part of tactics

6376.32 --> 6380.719
and like they're they don't

6381.56 --> 6387.8
care people that'll choose

6384.48 --> 6390.4
to like absolute power over others and

6387.8 --> 6393.96
that will like lie and deceive

6390.4 --> 6397.199
and be all Marxist flip around

6393.96 --> 6399.56
everything like they don't care like

6397.199 --> 6402.36
voting striking it's all just the means

6399.56 --> 6405.679
to an end to them anyway like doesn't do

6402.36 --> 6408.639
anything they don't care about

6405.679 --> 6411.56
masses mass of people with opinions they

6408.639 --> 6416.28
don't give a [Â __Â ] about

6411.56 --> 6419.4400000000005
that only care for that they can get

6416.28 --> 6422.639
away with maximum evil that's all they

6419.44 --> 6422.638999999999
care about

6424.679 --> 6431.119
so Savage punishment could be an actual

6428.88 --> 6433.28
deterrent it's like yeah this is what

6431.119 --> 6437.119
actually happens like you can't actually

6433.28 --> 6440.759999999999
get away you don't just go to jail after

6437.119 --> 6444.88
a a long long

6440.76 --> 6448.56
time now you actually get really a

6444.88 --> 6448.56
painful very painful

6449.48 --> 6454.119
end that's a better deterrent

6475.0 --> 6480.599
you're embarrassment Steven Jarvis you

6477.92 --> 6483.1990000000005
could actually say something like that

6480.599 --> 6483.1990000000005
it's just

6484.119 --> 6490.08
[Â __Â ] youve seen a

6487.44 --> 6492.879999999999
movie and in the movies a globe and

6490.08 --> 6496.36
that's an argument is it Steven

6492.88 --> 6498.679
Jarvis pathetic look at what's coming

6496.36 --> 6501.199
out of

6498.679 --> 6503.28
here if that was meant as some kind of a

6501.199 --> 6505.199
joke it's a pathetic joke

6503.28 --> 6507.5199999999995
and it's a pathetic point of view it's a

6505.199 --> 6510.0
pathetic argument for a glober to make

6507.52 --> 6511.639
under any circumstances no matter who

6510.0 --> 6516.159
you're talking

6511.639 --> 6519.1990000000005
to right even if a person seems to be in

6516.159 --> 6521.679
inspired by a science fiction

6519.199 --> 6524.199
franchise it doesn't really matter in

6521.679 --> 6528.08
the face of what you just said there

6524.199 --> 6528.08
absolutely pathetic

6540.35 --> 6545.320000000001
[Music]

6543.119 --> 6548.639
I mean if you're a Ballard and you catch

6545.32 --> 6549.759999999999
yourself publicly appealing to a science

6548.639 --> 6552.2390000000005
fiction

6549.76 --> 6554.96
movie as

6552.239 --> 6556.919999999999
proof there's something seriously wrong

6554.96 --> 6561.52
with

6556.92 --> 6561.52
you you got a problem

6577.4 --> 6583.799999999999
someone said yeah and your rebuttal is

6580.159 --> 6585.4
to bring up a science fiction movie

6583.8 --> 6589.88
Steven

6585.4 --> 6589.879999999999
Jarvis that's pathetic

6633.119 --> 6635.44
hello

6635.47 --> 6638.669
[Music]

6642.76 --> 6651.4800000000005
dupons it's his fault what for having a

6647.48 --> 6651.48
name no

6657.8 --> 6663.599
and besides he's right nobody has ever

6660.0 --> 6666.52
seen the ball Earth with their own

6663.599 --> 6670.360000000001
eyes cuz it's not a

6666.52 --> 6671.4400000000005
ball yeah every time you got to see some

6670.36 --> 6673.32
kind of a

6671.44 --> 6676.879999999999
ball in

6673.32 --> 6683.199
a picture not a

6676.88 --> 6687.88
photo it photoshoop cuz it has to be

6683.199 --> 6691.36
cuz you can't get a photograph of ball

6687.88 --> 6694.84
Earth because Earth is not a

6691.36 --> 6697.88
ball so you can't get a photograph of

6694.84 --> 6697.88
Earth as a

6700.76 --> 6710.52
ball you have to photoshop it into a

6705.76 --> 6714.52
ball to make it look like a

6710.52 --> 6714.52
ball cuz it's not a ball

6714.92 --> 6720.4
you can only take photographs from

6718.119 --> 6723.28
within the

6720.4 --> 6727.119
realm and you'll just

6723.28 --> 6727.119
see the ground

6728.52 --> 6733.4400000000005
everywhere that's what you get to see

6748.0 --> 6752.32
though don't talk [Â __Â ]

6753.4 --> 6761.879999999999
Moxy what about photos of half of

6757.679 --> 6761.88
it what the [Â __Â ] does that even

6765.88 --> 6773.159000000001
mean it would still just be a photo no

6769.32 --> 6776.92
photos are evidence

6773.159 --> 6779.04
Optimus Prime but they don't have photos

6776.92 --> 6784.4400000000005
there are no

6779.04 --> 6787.48
photos there's no photos of ball

6784.44 --> 6789.04
Earth there's only

6787.48 --> 6792.959999999999
pictures

6789.04 --> 6796.719
assembled edited

6792.96 --> 6800.159
pictures based off photographic material

6796.719 --> 6801.84
but not presented as is yeah that's why

6800.159 --> 6803.0
it's not a photograph anymore it's

6801.84 --> 6805.4800000000005
altered

6803.0 --> 6808.679
th it cannot be classified a photograph

6805.48 --> 6813.44
it has to be classified a

6808.679 --> 6816.4800000000005
picture because it's not the

6813.44 --> 6818.759999999999
original photograph as is had to be

6816.48 --> 6821.48
worked on in order to make it look the

6818.76 --> 6821.4800000000005
way that it's

6821.65 --> 6824.799999999999
[Music]

6830.04 --> 6836.639
presented you can see all of this

6832.56 --> 6839.079000000001
surface it's total

6836.639 --> 6842.159000000001
nonsense nobody's claiming you should

6839.079 --> 6845.88
Steven Jarvis says seems like your your

6842.159 --> 6845.879999999999
screws are getting a little loose in

6849.96 --> 6855.639
there it just doesn't appear to us

6853.76 --> 6857.96
visually like a ball you have to

6855.639 --> 6861.28
photoshop it into making it look like a

6857.96 --> 6864.28
ball somehow cuz it naturally doesn't do

6861.28 --> 6864.28
that

6884.88 --> 6892.88
uh s blade

6888.04 --> 6892.88
nothing what the hell can you do

6898.84 --> 6903.400000000001
like I don't know if you know this you

6901.8 --> 6905.56
probably didn't reason it out because

6903.4 --> 6909.199
you're just being a like kind of a

6905.56 --> 6912.52
backstabber here yeah saw

6909.199 --> 6914.839999999999
blade so I don't see you uh hanging

6912.52 --> 6918.2390000000005
around here for

6914.84 --> 6920.28
long but uh yeah actually

6918.239 --> 6924.839999999999
institutionalizing

6920.28 --> 6927.5199999999995
people costs more money money yeah so if

6924.84 --> 6929.159000000001
you're like complaining about people's

6927.52 --> 6932.2390000000005
productivity

6929.159 --> 6934.759999999999
oh just institutionalize yeah yeah that

6932.239 --> 6937.959999999999
actually costs

6934.76 --> 6941.56
more so the best solution is to do

6937.96 --> 6943.44
nothing perhaps provide them with

6941.56 --> 6946.119000000001
opportunity and that's the best you

6943.44 --> 6946.119
could do out of

6950.079 --> 6954.079
it right

6954.119 --> 6956.239
I

6958.48 --> 6963.36
mean they're not a drain on hardworking

6963.44 --> 6968.839999999999
people what is a drain on hardworking

6966.119 --> 6972.96
people is if you get in the way of them

6968.84 --> 6975.679
if you harass others actively or if you

6972.96 --> 6981.2390000000005
do provable criminal

6975.679 --> 6984.4400000000005
actions cuz that does damage costs money

6981.239 --> 6986.5199999999995
repairs Etc that kind of thing yeah

6984.44 --> 6989.32
that's going to be a problem people that

6986.52 --> 6991.92
are just like not really well integrated

6989.32 --> 6995.199
with society that don't want to be part

6991.92 --> 6997.32
of some shitty job system yeah they're

6995.199 --> 7000.879999999999
not much of a burden

6997.32 --> 7004.199
really I mean it's not

7000.88 --> 7007.56
great but you can't you can't even

7004.199 --> 7010.119
remotely compare that to actually

7007.56 --> 7013.159000000001
violent criminal

7010.119 --> 7015.92
people that's a problem violent criminal

7013.159 --> 7020.638999999999
people that are like unpredictable and

7015.92 --> 7022.4
just do incredible damage on a whim like

7020.639 --> 7026.719
that's actually a

7022.4 --> 7026.719
problem people that refuse to

7027.199 --> 7031.678999999999
work that's not really that much of a

7033.679 --> 7039.079
problem I mean it'd be better if they

7036.44 --> 7043.32
would but the way everything works it

7039.079 --> 7043.32
doesn't really matter at all

7044.679 --> 7048.52
yeah I know clutch I see what he's doing

7046.8 --> 7051.400000000001
too and that's why I'm getting real with

7048.52 --> 7051.400000000001

Optimus uh I don't think they're here to

7249.28 --> 7254.92
really get your respect

7252.04 --> 7258.28
you make a good point though but they're

7254.92 --> 7258.28
not there they're

7258.36 --> 7263.799999999999
look these are ballers they're neutral

7261.239 --> 7265.199
until you test their ball faith and then

7263.8 --> 7268.56
they just

7265.199 --> 7270.5599999999995
get nonsensical ridiculing and

7268.56 --> 7273.4400000000005
misinterpreting and like they get

7270.56 --> 7275.76
everything wrong on purpose that's what

7273.44 --> 7279.678999999999
part of that strategy it's called

7275.76 --> 7282.76
confusion so in confusion so that we

7279.679 --> 7286.56
will be deterred in our inquiry and just

7282.76 --> 7287.599
move on so that they don't have to

7286.56 --> 7291.04
remain

7287.599 --> 7294.119000000001
confronted with the problems that test

7291.04 --> 7297.4
their religious Faith to which they have

7294.119 --> 7301.079
no proper answer yeah that's why they do

7297.4 --> 7305.759999999999
this they know exactly how this

7301.079 --> 7308.88
works I've lived through it for a decade

7305.76 --> 7312.320000000001
I know exactly how this works nobody's

7308.88 --> 7314.599
going to tell me that I'm wrong or taken

7312.32 --> 7317.04
or anything about this I know exactly

7314.599 --> 7317.04
what this

7323.639 --> 7330.28
is do they really not realize that their

7326.8 --> 7330.28
tactics don't work on us

7330.56 --> 7338.119000000001
no no they don't realize it doesn't work

7333.119 --> 7341.639
on us because they're doing it to for

7338.119 --> 7341.639
themselves really

7342.119 --> 7346.759999999999
right if they're distracted they're no

7344.639 --> 7349.0
longer confronted with their

7346.76 --> 7351.76
demolishment of their

7349.0 --> 7353.92
faith now we don't fall for it but we

7351.76 --> 7356.719
might get agitated oh that's not their

7353.92 --> 7360.28
problem because at least the attention

7356.719 --> 7361.36
will be drawn away from the demolishment

7360.28 --> 7363.5599999999995
of their

7361.36 --> 7367.5199999999995
faith and that's really the only thing

7363.56 --> 7367.52
they care about in the moment

7372.079 --> 7377.5599999999995
right they prioritize being maneuvered

7375.48 --> 7380.0
away from the demolishment of their

7377.56 --> 7383.159000000001
faith with their focus and

7380.0 --> 7386.719
attention over whatever result what

7383.159 --> 7386.719
they're saying is going to

7390.56 --> 7395.119000000001
have so very short term you

7396.84 --> 7402.599
see they meant Leo yeah provably blue

7401.4 --> 7405.119
evolution

7402.599 --> 7408.400000000001
you can catalog

7405.119 --> 7412.119
it the mental illness can be

7408.4 --> 7414.119
cataloged to a degree where you can very

7412.119 --> 7415.88
accurately predict exactly what

7414.119 --> 7418.159
somebody's going to do in response to

7415.88 --> 7420.56
certain

7418.159 --> 7423.5599999999995
things just like what I'm doing right

7420.56 --> 7423.56
now

7427.67 --> 7431.209
[Music]

7460.36 --> 7464.199
do I know you by the way Optimus Prime I

7463.0 --> 7468.239
mean you're

7464.199 --> 7472.239
relatively young account four days old

7468.239 --> 7472.239
actually Dutch that's

7484.719 --> 7492.4800000000005
interesting like are you anybody that I

7487.159 --> 7492.48
I used to know you've been around

7499.159 --> 7506.96
well by your name I can already deduce

7503.119 --> 7511.839999999999
that you are a little bit into Dutch

7506.96 --> 7514.4800000000005
politics because the [Â __Â ] is a definite

7511.84 --> 7518.28
indicator about

7514.48 --> 7521.598999999999
that been at my home if you oh wait you

7518.28 --> 7521.599
Dutch sailor

7530.04 --> 7532.84
this a new

7535.92 --> 7543.88
account AG well all

7538.96 --> 7543.88
right okay yeah welcome back didn't know

7548.119 --> 7553.159
that right yeah good to have you back

7553.599 --> 7561.96
hope you're doing all

7556.04 --> 7561.96
right how's the uh the metal recycling

7562.639 --> 7570.84
business think you'll leave you to the

7565.8 --> 7574.4800000000005
Wolves uh I mean we had a bit of a run

7570.84 --> 7577.559
in some uh

7574.48 --> 7582.839999999999
conflictions but uh it's good to see you

7577.559 --> 7582.84
back never been better okay awesome

7587.719 --> 7591.679
yeah I'm doing pretty well as well I

7589.159 --> 7596.119
mean there's a lot of changes that has

7591.679 --> 7596.119
happened since we kind of lost

7596.159 --> 7600.199
contact yeah it is Dutch sailor

7606.04 --> 7611.679
indeed cool down forgive a lot yeah

7609.76 --> 7615.559
that's kind of what I was hoping for I

7611.679 --> 7619.119
mean I've been like very harsh to a lot

7615.559 --> 7621.92
of people but it was really the overall

7619.119 --> 7624.558999999999
circumstances that were like generally

7621.92 --> 7626.4800000000005
out of control and not just because I

7624.559 --> 7628.679
was out of control but because like I

7626.48 --> 7632.239
just couldn't deal

7628.679 --> 7636.4
with just all this pushiness from all

7632.239 --> 7638.4
sides so yeah radical changes in my

7636.4 --> 7643.5199999999995
overall setup not part of Flat Earth

7638.4 --> 7643.5199999999995
debates anymore and that palpably helped

7645.52 --> 7650.4800000000005
and now I can just generally work on my

7654.199 --> 7660.598999999999
attitude to prevent a necessary

7658.199 --> 7663.44
friction which was really just a side

7660.599 --> 7667.0
effect of the overall tension that was

7663.44 --> 7667.0
on me because of

7667.96 --> 7672.28
everything Dutch that makes me your

7670.159 --> 7674.92
brother okay I appreciate that and I

7672.28 --> 7678.28
agree I mean I do I do definitely care

7674.92 --> 7678.28
for the Dutch people as well

7682.88 --> 7687.28
and we're in a tough spot right now in

7685.96 --> 7691.8

7687.28 --> 7691.8
Netherlands hey Gary Fe

7704.04 --> 7710.559

7716.36 --> 7720.839999999999

so much well I really appre app I mean

8031.88 --> 8035.76
yeah do my mail

8035.96 --> 8043.639
absolutely that's that's awesome or

8038.84 --> 8043.639
PayPal but I mean I do actually take

8048.199 --> 8053.239
mail and if you're willing to send me

8050.8 --> 8054.719
money over the mail I mean it is a bit

8053.239 --> 8056.44
of a risk you never really know what's

8054.719 --> 8059.079
going to happen especially if it's large

8056.44 --> 8061.32
amounts but I've never really had a

8059.079 --> 8064.5199999999995
problem with that

8061.32 --> 8068.32
that it's gone missing or anything thus

8064.52 --> 8072.559
far so yeah I do take

8068.32 --> 8072.558999999999
mail and yeah any support is

8078.36 --> 8084.199
great don't have yeah yeah you told me

8081.28 --> 8087.48
right never use

8084.199 --> 8087.48
it I get

8089.0 --> 8093.8
it all right no but if you want to visit

8091.639 --> 8096.159000000001
me again and that would be just that

8093.8 --> 8096.159000000001
would be

8116.44 --> 8121.44
cool don't trust those guys I don't

8119.76 --> 8124.599
think it has anything to do with trust

8121.44 --> 8128.36
just with available

8124.599 --> 8132.32
options right I mean trust those guys do

8128.36 --> 8132.32
I trust the owners of

8135.719 --> 8140.92
PayPal I'm just really glad that they're

8138.52 --> 8144.400000000001
allowing me to do what I do and that

8140.92 --> 8148.719
they're not like cutting me off despite

8144.4 --> 8151.199
my I guess relatively extreme

8148.719 --> 8153.119
opinions it's just that I don't

8151.199 --> 8156.558999999999
typically stick

8153.119 --> 8158.799999999999
to specific political jargon like I'm

8156.559 --> 8159.92
not being part of a political movement

8158.8 --> 8162.079000000001
in that

8159.92 --> 8164.0
sense and I think that that's why

8162.079 --> 8166.199
they're probably leaving me alone I'm

8164.0 --> 8166.199
not

8167.559 --> 8174.360000000001
sure I'm just happy that they're willing

8170.52 --> 8176.52
to help me stay AF flat survive this

8174.36 --> 8180.5199999999995
because like I would literally would

8176.52 --> 8181.599
know how to survive without having

8180.52 --> 8184.360000000001
PayPal

8181.599 --> 8187.559
to get extra income like

8184.36 --> 8189.96
that for food which is exactly what I

8187.559 --> 8189.96
use it

8197.8 --> 8205.358999999999
for hilers yeah hilers is is scary but I

8202.24 --> 8209.88
mean that's literally media

8205.359 --> 8209.880000000001
Dutch media Central

8211.319 --> 8217.199999999999
PO is brought To Us by Elon no it isn't

8214.76 --> 8217.2
that's

8218.399 --> 8227.319
nonsense it's just a dumb rumor Gary

8222.439 --> 8232.16
F Elon didn't bring PayPal at

8227.319 --> 8235.76
all he was an owner for it of it for a

8232.16 --> 8238.399
very short time didn't create it was

8235.76 --> 8238.399
already

8239.12 --> 8243.559000000001
there it's nothing to do with

8245.8 --> 8254.358999999999
him if you hate him so much well why are

8248.88 --> 8257.92
you spreading rumors of of his supposed

8254.359 --> 8261.92
exploits then which he

8257.92 --> 8261.92
didn't yeah

8274.719 --> 8278.8
I mean you are literally being an

8276.96 --> 8282.639
example of what Mark Sergeant was

8278.8 --> 8285.24
talking about on the night

8282.639 --> 8289.16
show about how people are just

8285.24 --> 8294.399
worshiping him by making claims about

8289.16 --> 8294.399
how he invented all this stuff and he

8294.76 --> 8303.359
didn't just bought into it and then

8299.28 --> 8303.359
afterward claim credit for

8305.559 --> 8312.88
it that's absolute nonsense Gary

8309.2 --> 8312.880000000001
absolute nonsense

8339.319 --> 8346.519
still own shares who

8342.16 --> 8348.359
cares dude shares oh oh dude every

8346.519 --> 8350.479
[Â __Â ] thing out there is owned by

8348.359 --> 8354.24
Black Rock

8350.479 --> 8356.639
yeah everything you do is going to make

8354.24 --> 8360.119999999999
money end up in the pockets of

8356.639 --> 8365.438999999998
unbelievably disgusting people yeah

8360.12 --> 8365.439
everything anything you use

8365.599 --> 8374.92
anything anything like including buying

8369.76 --> 8377.439
a [Â __Â ] pencil like anything yeah so

8374.92 --> 8380.16
oh no if you do this it'll help that who

8377.439 --> 8383.76
gives a [Â __Â ] yeah everything is [Â __Â ]

8380.16 --> 8383.76
owned by Black

8384.88 --> 8390.16
Rock one way or the other somebody

8388.559 --> 8392.92
that's really nasty is going to be

8390.16 --> 8396.479
making money of it it's completely

8392.92 --> 8396.479
pointless to think about these

8407.0 --> 8410.78
[Music]

8415.76 --> 8421.359
things

8417.56 --> 8424.519999999999
confinity oh wow so he renamed it

8421.359 --> 8424.52
whoopy [Â __Â ]

8440.16 --> 8445.399
new PayPal doesn't make money it does a

8443.24 --> 8448.399
little bit these days

8445.399 --> 8448.399
Optimus

8448.8 --> 8455.16
unfortunately but I mean it's still very

8452.52 --> 8457.68
doable it's it's a

8455.16 --> 8461.319
better percentage than like what

8457.68 --> 8461.319
freaking YouTube gives

8463.88 --> 8472.358999999999
you YouTube literally takes 60 freaking

8469.319 --> 8475.72
per. okay

8472.359 --> 8480.720000000001
60% I mean that's just insane like

8475.72 --> 8480.72
PayPal just takes a tiny cut

8481.8 --> 8490.399
so yeah I'll take Paypal over

8487.12 --> 8490.399000000001
YouTube any

8490.76 --> 8496.800000000001
day yeah 60% really yeah that's exactly

8494.479 --> 8500.679999999998
what they take

8496.8 --> 8504.8
yeah it's been like that for a while and

8500.68 --> 8507.52
every freaking Super Chat in YouTube

8504.8 --> 8510.96
yeah that means 60% goes to

8507.52 --> 8513.76
them and the rest you can keep that's

8510.96 --> 8513.759999999998
exactly what that

8517.72 --> 8525.8
means oh dude that's terrible yes say

8522.96 --> 8528.72
really that's terrible that's outrageous

8525.8 --> 8531.8
yeah why the hell do you think that I

8528.72 --> 8534.519999999999
turned super chats

8531.8 --> 8537.64
off years

8534.52 --> 8541.359
ago because I thought it was absolutely

8537.64 --> 8541.358999999999
horrendous too

8543.76 --> 8548.12
yeah and I still kept monetized for like

8545.88 --> 8550.16
the ad money but that was like barely

8548.12 --> 8554.68
anything anyway and then they

8550.16 --> 8557.439
demonetized me oh no oh no now I can't

8554.68 --> 8558.76
give 60% of all the things that come

8557.439 --> 8562.399
into

8558.76 --> 8565.08
you oh oh

8562.399 --> 8566.24
no I'm going to try to remonetized

8565.08 --> 8569.72
though in

8566.24 --> 8572.119999999999
June but uh it's just for the ad income

8569.72 --> 8573.72
that's it

8572.12 --> 8576.160000000002
right in the

8573.72 --> 8578.319
meantime I could always use support

8576.16 --> 8580.92
through the

8578.319 --> 8583.8
PayPal so please do support me through

8580.92 --> 8585.88
the PayPal or become part of the patreon

8583.8 --> 8587.0
like plunder 23 did recently I'm very

8585.88 --> 8590.358999999999
happy about

8587.0 --> 8593.24
that I always love to see other patreon

8590.359 --> 8595.92
members they're kind of rare to

8593.24 --> 8599.56
me I don't think I've ever had more

8595.92 --> 8601.6
patreon supporters at at one time than

8599.56 --> 8604.479
like

8601.6 --> 8606.439
six which is kind of

8604.479 --> 8609.88
pathetic I mean if you see other

8606.439 --> 8611.24
people's patreon list is like 20 to 50

8609.88 --> 8614.479
to 100

8611.24 --> 8618.0
people so I could always use more of

8614.479 --> 8620.64
that I mean if I had like 20 patreon

8618.0 --> 8624.2
supporters that would give me like five

8620.64 --> 8627.479
to 10 bucks every month that would be

8624.2 --> 8631.76
very very helpful it would like palpably

8627.479 --> 8631.76
change my overall situation

8646.6 --> 8651.720000000001
didn't you have to Dat Back yeah because

8648.84 --> 8655.72
I have to report it yeah that's on top

8651.72 --> 8655.72
of that set tap I didn't even address

8658.56 --> 8663.08
that right but I mean it's still good

8660.72 --> 8663.08
for my

8667.08 --> 8673.319
stats and also like the timing of it is

8669.92 --> 8673.319
kind of convenient because

8675.72 --> 8681.64
like like the money from YouTube tends

8678.52 --> 8684.68
to come in like halfway the month then

8681.64 --> 8688.88
it's eventually detracted from welfare

8684.68 --> 8691.08
check but it is kind of a nice little

8688.88 --> 8692.92
chunk of money ahead

8691.08 --> 8695.479
of the main

8692.92 --> 8701.0
bit but yeah technically I don't really

8695.479 --> 8701.0
keep anything from it but oh well

8723.0 --> 8728.359
for the one off videos that you upload

8726.399 --> 8730.199999999999
that don't get to me what I don't know

8728.359 --> 8733.12
what the hell you're talking about Gary

8730.2 --> 8733.12
I don't have such

8739.279 --> 8746.319000000001
videos put the other half on Pat yeah

8742.6 --> 8746.319
how about no

8752.279 --> 8756.279
yeah I mean I could do all kinds of

8753.84 --> 8758.880000000001
other things oh I could go to rock Fin

8756.279 --> 8761.2
and just make it completely

8758.88 --> 8763.92
pay-per-view all that [Â __Â ] yeah I could

8761.2 --> 8767.560000000001
do that but I'm not going to because I'm

8763.92 --> 8767.56
going to be public

8783.88 --> 8788.679999999998
let them watch channel

8786.359 --> 8790.92
247 uh no that doesn't really work

8788.68 --> 8793.439
Optimus Prime I appreciate that though

8790.92 --> 8795.56
but I mean I think that the electric

8793.439 --> 8797.76
cost for doing that alone would not

8795.56 --> 8799.08
outweigh the benefits that I'd get out

8797.76 --> 8802.56
of

8799.08 --> 8804.68
it and besides my channel isn't

8802.56 --> 8806.96
monetized currently so it'll literally

8804.68 --> 8806.960000000001
do

8808.279 --> 8813.12
nothing you're better off like using

8810.92 --> 8816.319
those computers to try to mine Bitcoin

8813.12 --> 8816.319000000001
or something

8851.24 --> 8855.0
H okay

8855.6 --> 8861.08
cool yeah by the way I'm still using

8858.76 --> 8863.359
your monitor by the way and it's

8861.08 --> 8865.479
performing but it is kind of glitching

8863.359 --> 8867.08
out on me

8865.479 --> 8870.199999999999
sometimes

8867.08 --> 8872.6
so I'm actually here to at some point

8870.2 --> 8875.92
get a new

8872.6 --> 8880.6
monitor I don't know if you happen to

8875.92 --> 8881.399
have one laying around that's like 1080P

8880.6 --> 8883.960000000001
or

8881.399 --> 8886.0
something I mean maybe you do maybe you

8883.96 --> 8889.479
don't I mean I could go on with this

8886.0 --> 8889.479
thing probably for more

8891.24 --> 8895.8
years but it is starting to get a bit

8897.52 --> 8905.16
old 1 meter wide Fork no no I don't

8902.04 --> 8905.160000000002
don't want that

8920.52 --> 8924.359
no AP

8928.64 --> 8932.68
okay all right

8930.8 --> 8936.039999999999
Well yeah debatably if it's actually I

8932.68 --> 8940.479000000001
could really use it I

8936.04 --> 8943.0
think just I don't know I recommend not

8940.479 --> 8947.56
sending it over the mail because they

8943.0 --> 8947.56
tend to break when you do that

8970.399 --> 8974.92
yeah that's right no no patreons don't

8972.92 --> 8977.439
get anything special it's not the

8974.92 --> 8980.479
special boy club if you pay me money you

8977.439 --> 8983.16
get the special VIP video or whatever no

8980.479 --> 8983.16
I don't do

8983.8 --> 8988.479
that I don't have that kind of nonsense

8986.64 --> 8990.599999999999
I don't do

8988.479 --> 8993.199999999999
that I'm not

8990.6 --> 8996.359
I'm not interested in

8993.2 --> 9000.279
cultivating special boy

8996.359 --> 9003.68
videos for special boys like I don't do

9000.279 --> 9006.960000000001
that I just

9003.68 --> 9008.64
don't I have an overall performance of

9006.96 --> 9011.278999999999
what I do how I

9008.64 --> 9015.599999999999
develop and I try to just cont

9011.279 --> 9018.2
contribute and I'm

9015.6 --> 9020.800000000001
yeah if you like what I do and if you

9018.2 --> 9023.439
want to help me improve my situ and my

9020.8 --> 9026.759999999998
performance than just general support

9023.439 --> 9026.76
that's that's how it

9039.359 --> 9046.56
works huh all right Optimus yeah thanks

9043.84 --> 9050.24
definitely keep an eye out for like a

9046.56 --> 9051.84
thp monitor or 12

9050.24 --> 9053.52
like

9051.84 --> 9057.0
1,200

9053.52 --> 9059.16
P the size bigger I don't know these

9057.0 --> 9064.76
days there's like like what even is the

9059.16 --> 9067.399
standard I mean 1, 80P is like basic

9064.76 --> 9071.16
default now or

9067.399 --> 9075.119999999999
something so I I just can't keep track

9071.16 --> 9076.96
of 4K monitors and all that [Â __Â ] but I

9075.12 --> 9079.800000000001
definitely don't need that kind of high

9076.96 --> 9082.679999999998
resolution at all it'll just be more of

9079.8 --> 9082.679999999998
a an electrical

9087.08 --> 9091.76
drain what I mostly want is a monitor

9089.96 --> 9094.679999999998
that doesn't

9091.76 --> 9096.52
glitch and that kind of lasts that

9094.68 --> 9099.399
that's the most important and I want it

9096.52 --> 9104.16
to be straight no freaking curved

9099.399 --> 9104.16
freaking monitors I hate those things

9115.399 --> 9123.439
No Deal okay gy well then just [Â __Â ] off

[Music]

9262.76 --> 9266.72
youtubing isn't the job yeah it

9274.76 --> 9279.960000000001
is right hey if you want to be a cheap

9277.279 --> 9282.12
skate well that's just going to make me

9279.96 --> 9287.08
get that little bit closer to just

9282.12 --> 9287.08
deciding to kick you out again zap tappy

9290.59 --> 9293.719000000001
[Music]

9297.2 --> 9302.92
for the 50th time yeah yeah for the 50th

9300.56 --> 9305.119999999999
time that's

9302.92 --> 9307.24
right I mean I don't know if you

9305.12 --> 9309.800000000001
remember I don't even know if you

9307.24 --> 9313.64
remember your own activity theyve had

9309.8 --> 9313.64
you banned for like two years

9313.96 --> 9321.119999999999
straight yeah I don't know if you mind

9317.319 --> 9326.439
but it's just very effort to just have

9321.12 --> 9326.439
you banned again for another 5 years

9329.12 --> 9334.160000000002
yeah uh no and I won't unban you because

9332.16 --> 9336.92
the Chat is dead that's never why I

9334.16 --> 9340.2
unban people I don't unban people

9336.92 --> 9341.960000000001
because the Chat is dead I unban them

9340.2 --> 9344.279
because I think yeah enough time has

9341.96 --> 9347.438999999998
passed I'll give you another chance and

9344.279 --> 9350.68
maybe you'll be better than last

9347.439 --> 9352.960000000001
time that's why I unban people

9350.68 --> 9356.24
not because oh there not enough people

9352.96 --> 9359.759999999998
in the chat yeah [Â __Â ] the chat you

9356.24 --> 9359.76
really think I'm going to unban

9360.6 --> 9365.720000000001
scumbags because I don't have enough

9362.88 --> 9368.479
people commenting in the chat what you

9365.72 --> 9371.76
you think that nobody commenting in the

9368.479 --> 9375.319
chat the solution to that is to like get

9371.76 --> 9377.960000000001
people that are pieces of [Â __Â ] just so I

9375.319 --> 9381.56
could have a conversation no no no

9377.96 --> 9381.56
that's not why I unban people

9381.68 --> 9385.6
I un ban them to give them another

9387.56 --> 9394.8
chance does akumu still come around here

9391.56 --> 9394.8

9399.96 --> 9404.119999999999
the hell he's doing maybe he's just

9401.439 --> 9406.12
moving on to other

9404.12 --> 9409.12
communities maybe it's just having a

9406.12 --> 9409.12
break

10070.76 --> 10075.399
what uh I don't know about that Nathan

10082.2 --> 10088.399000000001
Yamaha I don't know if the military

10084.439 --> 10091.92
industral complex really involves itself

10088.399 --> 10095.358999999999
with social media Flat

10091.92 --> 10098.960000000001
Earth gatekeeping kind of thing I'm not

10095.359 --> 10098.960000000001
sure if they do

10103.439 --> 10105.720000000001
they

10105.88 --> 10113.08
might but I mean it's it's

10108.92 --> 10116.319
just general mind control like govern

10113.08 --> 10118.399
mind government I think it's more in

10116.319 --> 10120.64
down their Lane because it's in

10118.399 --> 10124.039999999999
specifically in government's interest

10120.64 --> 10127.16
that the state propaganda narratives are

10124.04 --> 10130.359
believed and Flat Earth counters those

10127.16 --> 10131.68
State narratives

10130.359 --> 10134.319
so I don't know if the military

10131.68 --> 10137.56
industrial complex has any interest in

10134.319 --> 10137.56
it whatsoever

10175.279 --> 10180.880000000001

just a problem when some people see it a

10418.04 --> 10424.399000000001
jty joke as a cue to suddenly start

10420.88 --> 10426.519999999999
spouting disgusting references non-stop

10424.399 --> 10428.84
yeah that's the part where it's not

10426.52 --> 10431.12
funny

10428.84 --> 10434.12
cuz I think of dirty jokes

10431.12 --> 10435.479000000001
sometimes especially when they're like

10434.12 --> 10438.76
word

10435.479 --> 10441.319
jokes I think of that [Â __Â ] too but I

10438.76 --> 10443.880000000001
just don't like to like make it an item

10441.319 --> 10446.399
because then disgusting perverts were

10443.88 --> 10448.239
suddenly take it as a cue to turn

10446.399 --> 10454.199999999999
everything into like some kind of a sex

10448.239 --> 10458.88
club or something yeah and I hate

got and then it's like yeah [Â __Â ]

10570.279 --> 10574.84
governments are evil and like there's

10572.479 --> 10576.479
some really disgusting satanic people

10574.84 --> 10579.2
and they need to be

10576.479 --> 10580.519999999999
tortured that's going to be subject for

10579.2 --> 10584.04
another day so that's what you're going

10580.52 --> 10585.720000000001

interesting things oh yeah [Â __Â ]

10588.68 --> 10595.279
evil requires s Savage punishment yeah

10592.359 --> 10597.960000000001
that that's just going to keep

10595.279 --> 10600.560000000001
returning for as long as it needs to be

10597.96 --> 10602.358999999999
returning for as long as it's actually

10600.56 --> 10605.359
happening out

10602.359 --> 10605.359
there

10605.399 --> 10609.56
anyway a you checked out the mark

10607.439 --> 10612.56
Sergeant show

10609.56 --> 10614.84
yeah yeah no I was very happy about that

10612.56 --> 10616.92
I I listened to it too yesterday evening

10614.84 --> 10619.2
and it was a blast like it was fun to

10616.92 --> 10619.2
listen

10620.479 --> 10626.08
to I'm very satisfied with like the

10623.479 --> 10629.358999999999
amount that I actually talked I really

10626.08 --> 10629.359
gave him a lot of

10629.479 --> 10636.519999999999
room and I had no trouble focusing

10633.399 --> 10639.76
whatsoever so I I thought I did great I

10636.52 --> 10642.6
was really nervous for that for that

10639.76 --> 10645.68
show before it it actually

10642.6 --> 10648.0
started and and at the end I like Ram

10645.68 --> 10650.64
along was like a fanboy which kind of

10648.0 --> 10653.96
shows like how

10650.64 --> 10656.599999999999
much tension I had over it I mean I've

10653.96 --> 10659.96
anticipated doing a show like this for

10656.6 --> 10659.960000000001
10 years

10669.76 --> 10678.279
misunderstand oh yes sure M oh yes we

10674.08 --> 10682.88
misunderstand oh yes oh our flat Earths

10678.279 --> 10685.880000000001
oh we just misunderstand it oh yeah yeah

10682.88 --> 10688.759999999998
no we don't we totally [Â __Â ]

10685.88 --> 10691.08
understand exactly how all that works

10688.76 --> 10693.880000000001
what the difference is pressure on the

10691.08 --> 10698.479
inside pressure on the outside yeah no

10693.88 --> 10703.92
we don't misunderstand any of that Moxy

10698.479 --> 10703.92
keep projecting that hor [Â __Â ] onto US

10704.03 --> 10707.2
[Music]

10734.64 --> 10741.16
yes have to be civil yeah it's not

10737.72 --> 10743.358999999999
exactly civil though zap tappy it's just

10741.16 --> 10746.6
Mark brought it

10743.359 --> 10749.479000000001
up I don't know why I mean oh it's all

10746.6 --> 10751.399000000001
the thing now oh David why like I don't

10749.479 --> 10753.679999999998
know why the hell they're like putting

10751.399 --> 10755.278999999999
that all that on such an incredible

10753.68 --> 10759.6
prominence when it really doesn't

10755.279 --> 10762.560000000001
deserve that level of prominence at all

10759.6 --> 10765.279
but uh yeah an argument like yeah you

10762.56 --> 10769.72
can't as a flat earther bring your aame

10765.279 --> 10773.640000000001
and dispel bow arguments in every tidy

10769.72 --> 10777.56
little corner or you'll

10773.64 --> 10781.16
embarrass the show host and and the

10777.56 --> 10783.6
director that don't want Flat Earth to

10781.16 --> 10785.88
win in the

10783.6 --> 10788.479000000001
argument because you already know that

10785.88 --> 10791.839999999998
about these shows and so you have to

10788.479 --> 10791.84
hold back if you want an

10793.92 --> 10800.279
invite and that's just how it is it's

10796.68 --> 10803.6
not about oh we have to behave ourselves

10800.279 --> 10804.6
more civil no you just can't bring your

10803.6 --> 10807.399000000001
A

10804.6 --> 10809.56
game because otherwise the opponent is

10807.399 --> 10813.0
going to be like cornered and

10809.56 --> 10815.16
embarrassed and start to behave like six

10813.0 --> 10819.0
year-old

10815.16 --> 10821.64
tantrum tantrum kids and that's bad and

10819.0 --> 10827.16
then you'll never be invited back it

10821.64 --> 10827.16
will disrupt the regular flow of the

10829.279 --> 10834.800000000001
show and yeah it'll wake up a lot of

10831.76 --> 10838.2
people to Flat Earth and we'll set a lot

10834.8 --> 10840.08
of bad blood with the show host there

10838.2 --> 10841.960000000001
that obviously wouldn't be a flat

10840.08 --> 10844.08
earther otherwise they wouldn't have a

10841.96 --> 10846.839999999998
big show like that so yeah that's how

10844.08 --> 10851.08
that works has nothing to do with having

10846.84 --> 10853.56
to behave civil it's about not bringing

10851.08 --> 10856.2
your full plora of

10853.56 --> 10857.519999999999
arguments not bringing your aame that's

10856.2 --> 10859.2
what that conversation with Mark

10857.52 --> 10862.2
Sergeant was

10859.2 --> 10862.2
about

10863.279 --> 10869.84
why yeah because we don't per default

10867.2 --> 10873.359
not act civil

10869.84 --> 10876.0
yeah like immediately pointing at the

10873.359 --> 10879.2
groundworks of a baller's

10876.0 --> 10883.239
argumentation is not

10879.2 --> 10886.04
uncivil it's to the point it's straight

10883.239 --> 10890.199999999999
to the core to the

10886.04 --> 10894.359
point yeah pointing out foundational

10890.2 --> 10897.2
flaws on the spot as you go in a

10894.359 --> 10899.68
comprehensible way to Outsiders yeah and

10897.2 --> 10900.960000000001
then you lose all your footing as a

10899.68 --> 10903.239
globe

10900.96 --> 10906.72
argument which is personally

10903.239 --> 10908.84
embarrassing and like a strain on your

10906.72 --> 10910.64
ego

10908.84 --> 10914.16
which is

10910.64 --> 10917.119999999999
involved yeah that's what that is not

10914.16 --> 10919.56
being unil yeah that's not what that was

10917.12 --> 10922.560000000001

amicable and just like talking about the

10961.16 --> 10965.479
good

10962.64 --> 10969.84
stuff about the interesting stuff what

10965.479 --> 10969.84
made Flat Earth so damn interesting

10982.88 --> 10988.239
we will find ways to not get triggered

10985.359 --> 10988.239
through intellectual

10991.399 --> 10997.16
dishonesty was a really good show yeah

10993.64 --> 11000.278999999999

10997.16 --> 11002.6
I wish it would get more views I mean I

11000.279 --> 11005.479000000001
really hope you guys will share it like

11002.6 --> 11009.92
I mean it is kind of the video

11005.479 --> 11012.56
that is more newbie efficient so if it's

11009.92 --> 11014.92
like hey you didn't hear much about Flat

11012.56 --> 11017.119999999999
Earth well then don't shove the early

11014.92 --> 11020.2
bird show in their face that that might

11017.12 --> 11022.04
be very tough for them to deal with but

11020.2 --> 11025.0
definitely

11022.04 --> 11027.319000000001
shove the Knight owl show number 10 with

11025.0 --> 11028.239
Mark Sant in their face like that would

11027.319 --> 11032.119999999999
be great

11028.239 --> 11032.119999999999
that would be a good vantage

11042.8 --> 11050.56
point it was very amicable no cursing or

11047.0 --> 11052.96
anything and just a good

11050.56 --> 11056.64
