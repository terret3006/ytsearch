of by

361.6 --> 367.84000000000003

378.24 --> 381.759
of like

379.52 --> 384.79999999999995
that stuff's been pushed in my face from

381.759 --> 384.8
different directions

387.36 --> 391.72
with this guy's video this morning

392.83 --> 396.209
[Music]

398.639 --> 403.639
anyhow

400.319 --> 403.639
low backs

talking about owen going on jim brewer

413.68 --> 418.919

415.199 --> 418.91900000000004
i had two videos

422.24 --> 429.599
like with the with this brewer guy

425.52 --> 432.08
and then later on rebunked something

429.599 --> 433.919
now the brewer guy was like super hyper

432.08 --> 435.52
active like that's a guy that could just

433.919 --> 438.56
never shut up

435.52 --> 440.88
and he's ex he's super expressive

438.56 --> 443.199
it's kind of funny

440.88 --> 445.199
but yeah definitely hyperactive the

443.199 --> 447.039
other guy from rebunk was much more

445.199 --> 451.84000000000003
passive

447.039 --> 451.84
just let owen do most of the talking

460.479 --> 463.479
right

472.56 --> 479.16
register is transferring to the ground

475.12 --> 479.16
what are you talking about bex

484.4 --> 489.44
watch briar and eddie bravo yeah i can

487.28 --> 490.84
imagine those two combined would be

489.44 --> 495.52
quite

490.84 --> 495.52
a like hyperactive show

498.72 --> 502.8
kiss means

500.4 --> 506.44
okay max i don't know what you're

502.8 --> 506.44
talking about though

516.159 --> 519.389
[Music]

523.839 --> 527.2
right by the way i got an illuminati

525.68 --> 530.7199999999999
croissant

527.2 --> 530.72
but i don't know when i'm gonna eat it

532.959 --> 537.92
probably somewhere at the end of the

534.8 --> 537.92
show or right after

538.0 --> 544.519
or half way whatever

541.12 --> 544.519
i'll get hungry

554.16 --> 557.6
okay max

555.68 --> 560.0799999999999
right well that's a cute

557.6 --> 562.08
word game i don't know what

560.08 --> 564.24
are you talking about anything specific

562.08 --> 564.24
or

564.56 --> 570.8
is it just a general realization of the

568.08 --> 574.2
etymology of the words

570.8 --> 574.1999999999999
i get it

582.88 --> 589.76
well registering is technically like

587.04 --> 593.12
yeah transferring

589.76 --> 595.279
authority you could say in a way you are

593.12 --> 598.16
like you never register just randomly

595.279 --> 601.36
you register with like an organization

598.16 --> 604.36
or or a leader or something

601.36 --> 604.36
so

606.72 --> 613.44
if you register

609.36 --> 613.44
the live system

613.519 --> 618.279
i take it you mean belief system

618.64 --> 623.12
canon law i don't know what you mean

620.72 --> 623.12
with that

624.8 --> 629.04
okay

625.76 --> 629.04
max i'm hi

629.76 --> 635.959
you're see you seem a little bit

632.079 --> 635.959
distracted here

646.8 --> 649.68
tfh

648.56 --> 652.0
team

649.68 --> 654.16
what is that

652.0 --> 659.16
a turret

654.16 --> 659.16
what did i say about those shorts huh

665.68 --> 670.56
oh okay pgcnet

667.68 --> 670.56
all right good luck

672.959 --> 678.079
tinfoil hat podcast right was that so

675.76 --> 678.079
hard

678.16 --> 681.68
i mean

679.68 --> 685.2399999999999
it's only ten letters

681.68 --> 685.2399999999999
instead of three

696.24 --> 701.72
right yeah see you later pgcnet good

698.72 --> 701.72
luck

719.08 --> 722.379
[Music]

727.92 --> 732.88
there's a connection between stand-up

730.079 --> 734.6389999999999
comedians and conspiracies

732.88 --> 737.12
uh

734.639 --> 739.12
well there is now

737.12 --> 741.04
i think that they're always like kind of

739.12 --> 743.68
on the edge of

741.04 --> 746.7199999999999
dabbling on that even in the past

743.68 --> 748.959
but now it's all the new way

746.72 --> 748.9590000000001
right

750.8 --> 754.959
because there is a lot of conspiracy

752.48 --> 759.279
going on

754.959 --> 761.4399999999999
and still a lot of taboo so yeah comedy

759.279 --> 764.48
is a really appealing way for people to

761.44 --> 764.48
learn something about it

765.76 --> 769.639
without getting all intimidated

777.519 --> 782.8
so that connection is mostly

780.56 --> 782.8
just

782.88 --> 788.56
founded in pragmatism i i'd say tara 306

802.72 --> 808.6800000000001
start holding your hand over what what

805.04 --> 808.68
are you talking about

820.72 --> 825.12
the house industry oh wow okay tara

823.279 --> 827.4399999999999
you've been looking into my astrology

825.12 --> 827.44
stuff

827.76 --> 834.079
i have no idea

830.639 --> 834.0790000000001
what you're talking about really

834.48 --> 840.0
i'm not well familiar with like popular

837.839 --> 845.0400000000001
go around

840.0 --> 845.04
astrology related classification systems

845.199 --> 851.8
i mean i know like the the 12 signs and

847.92 --> 851.8
that's pretty much it

856.72 --> 860.32
and i don't even know them all by heart

858.639 --> 862.48
i can't just name them all in a row i

860.32 --> 862.48
just

864.32 --> 868.72
i know there's twelve

866.639 --> 871.6800000000001
and if i'd get to see the symbols i'd

868.72 --> 874.5600000000001
recognize them

871.68 --> 875.5999999999999
i roughly know where each sign is in the

874.56 --> 878.079
year

875.6 --> 878.0790000000001
roughly

881.97 --> 886.5600000000001
[Music]

883.199 --> 886.56
learning astrology

887.92 --> 893.8389999999999
okay well characteristics learning a lot

890.56 --> 895.5189999999999
right so you learned a lot about it

893.839 --> 896.5600000000001
what is it that you actually learned

895.519 --> 898.72
that

896.56 --> 899.68
is like

898.72 --> 901.6
well

899.68 --> 904.3199999999999
blatantly true

901.6 --> 904.32
and usable

904.88 --> 908.32
like what are things that you're still

906.72 --> 911.0400000000001
holding on to

908.32 --> 912.88
that you got from the astrology

911.04 --> 915.68
that you're like wow this this really

912.88 --> 917.67
made my life better

915.68 --> 920.88
tear it

917.67 --> 920.88
[Music]

927.279 --> 932.0
or is it really just another elaborate

930.0 --> 934.48
busying therapy

932.0 --> 935.519
just trying to categorize metaphysical

934.48 --> 937.36
things

935.519 --> 941.399
like

937.36 --> 941.399
what are you getting out of it

944.639 --> 950.44
ah

946.16 --> 950.4399999999999
got a derpcon three

963.839 --> 969.0
even children learn basics of okay

965.68 --> 969.0
that's interesting

982.48 --> 986.16
it's like learning the room or rules of

984.48 --> 988.72
the game

986.16 --> 988.7199999999999
perhaps

990.32 --> 995.0400000000001
it depends on what you're learning from

992.48 --> 997.04
it if you're just gonna classify things

995.04 --> 999.4399999999999
and then like have this category system

997.04 --> 1001.68
that you understand know by heart

999.44 --> 1003.6800000000001
but can't actually

1001.68 --> 1007.279
constantly cross reference with the real

1003.68 --> 1007.279
world experience yeah then

1007.519 --> 1011.639
what is it you're really learning

1012.48 --> 1018.9590000000001
makes being cohere cohort

1017.12 --> 1022.839
what

1018.959 --> 1022.8389999999999
holistic okay

1041.839 --> 1047.039
right there i understand that that's

1043.919 --> 1048.4
what would be said

1047.039 --> 1050.0
coherent

1048.4 --> 1054.0
holistic but

1050.0 --> 1057.28
do you have actual direct proof of that

1054.0 --> 1059.919
that's my question i'm basically

1057.28 --> 1062.48
applying my rules

1059.919 --> 1064.24
to you for a bit since you are a

1062.48 --> 1068.08
a follower

1064.24 --> 1070.64
or a workshop participant with a wrench

1068.08 --> 1073.6789999999999
so i'm just trying to see

1070.64 --> 1075.6000000000001
if you're applying my method

1073.679 --> 1077.6000000000001
what have you learned out of it what

1075.6 --> 1081.1999999999998
have you actually learned not just

1077.6 --> 1084.24
knowing something and then having a

1081.2 --> 1085.1200000000001
a shared dream that you

1084.24 --> 1087.2
might

1085.12 --> 1089.6789999999999
connect with other people because

1087.2 --> 1091.52
they'll know it but what

1089.679 --> 1093.8400000000001
other than that

1091.52 --> 1096.08
have you

1093.84 --> 1097.6789999999999
learned from it that you were like wow

1096.08 --> 1100.3999999999999
this really

1097.679 --> 1101.76
made things connect here for me and it

1100.4 --> 1103.679
keeps doing that even though i'm not

1101.76 --> 1107.32
reading it anymore

1103.679 --> 1107.3200000000002
that's what i'm asking

1114.799 --> 1117.28
okay

1118.32 --> 1121.32
hello

1130.96 --> 1135.799
okay emmanuel goldstein at least

1136.64 --> 1141.919
wow this must be an old

1138.559 --> 1144.24
old sock you got there

1141.919 --> 1147.24
you're very rich here

1144.24 --> 1147.24
right

1176.08 --> 1181.6789999999999
you see it play out and everywhere

1179.12 --> 1184.0
but can you actually translate that can

1181.679 --> 1187.4
you actually give an example of that

1184.0 --> 1187.4
terror 306.

1220.799 --> 1225.039
okay bex

1222.48 --> 1227.84
interesting so you're basically talking

1225.039 --> 1231.24
about contract history

1227.84 --> 1231.24
sounds like

1237.28 --> 1242.72
right because in in principle

1239.84 --> 1245.8799999999999
a registry is like a contract it is part

1242.72 --> 1245.88
of that

1278.48 --> 1282.96
tara that's

1279.76 --> 1285.52
you have not given me a single actual

1282.96 --> 1288.88
specific example

1285.52 --> 1288.8799999999999
this is all generalized

1289.039 --> 1294.64
i mean

1290.72 --> 1294.64
you could feel oh i learned

1295.6 --> 1300.1589999999999
and then get that out of it it could

1297.36 --> 1300.1589999999999
mean anything

1301.039 --> 1308.64
what actually did you learn

1304.799 --> 1311.36
directly from that astrology you learn

1308.64 --> 1314.159
not oh everything became bad oh yes of

1311.36 --> 1316.8799999999999
course that's super empirical can you

1314.159 --> 1318.4
actually directly cross reference this

1316.88 --> 1322.8400000000001
piece of information

1318.4 --> 1322.8400000000001
with that example in your life

1345.87 --> 1349.07
[Music]

1367.84 --> 1373.039
this is

1369.6 --> 1375.36
okay len lenox thanks for that

1373.039 --> 1375.36
that's

1375.679 --> 1379.44
obviously total horseshit

1386.96 --> 1390.32
absolute horseshit

1393.6 --> 1400.6
i mean you gotta be kidding me that that

1396.08 --> 1400.6
doesn't even look real

1419.36 --> 1424.7199999999998
oh it's super special by the way oh look

1422.08 --> 1426.559
look at the the name there jamie cooper

1424.72 --> 1428.08
photography

1426.559 --> 1430.559
right it's

1428.08 --> 1434.32
his photography

1430.559 --> 1437.36
it doesn't say it's a photograph though

1434.32 --> 1438.8799999999999
i'm quite certain it's an image

1437.36 --> 1441.52
they just

1438.88 --> 1443.279
don't directly say it

1441.52 --> 1446.6399999999999
huh huh

1443.279 --> 1446.64
it's all [Â __Â ]

1451.76 --> 1456.799
like that's not even like what the sun

1454.48 --> 1459.2
looks like

1456.799 --> 1462.4
may zoom in pretty much with anything

1459.2 --> 1462.4
this is complete

1462.559 --> 1469.0
garbage but thanks for the link and

1464.559 --> 1469.0
thanks for the information linux

1473.52 --> 1478.48
you can't get into details right now

1475.279 --> 1480.4
well maybe you exaggerated it a bit then

1478.48 --> 1484.039
tear it right

1480.4 --> 1484.039
that's why i'm asking

1492.01 --> 1495.15
[Music]

1496.159 --> 1500.96
right

1497.919 --> 1503.1200000000001
i mean

1500.96 --> 1505.8400000000001
relatively

1503.12 --> 1507.52
i have not learned that much

1505.84 --> 1509.1999999999998
from astrology

1507.52 --> 1511.9189999999999
i know it's a thing

1509.2 --> 1514.0
now there is cycles right that is the

1511.919 --> 1518.0800000000002
thing that i learned from astrology that

1514.0 --> 1520.799
there is cycles and those cycles can be

1518.08 --> 1522.6399999999999
connected up to the sky clock to the

1520.799 --> 1524.8799999999999
celestials

1522.64 --> 1527.6000000000001
for some reason not even saying that

1524.88 --> 1529.2
explains the cause of it it's just that

1527.6 --> 1531.279
the correlation

1529.2 --> 1533.039
the cycles right cycles is what i

1531.279 --> 1536.32
learned from astrology

1533.039 --> 1538.08
but i learned so much about cycles just

1536.32 --> 1541.279
from practical life

1538.08 --> 1543.9189999999999
and not from astrology

1541.279 --> 1548.72
with other things like oh it's a full

1543.919 --> 1550.48
moon you know you don't need astrology

1548.72 --> 1554.64
to figure that out

1550.48 --> 1558.24
it's it's kind of widely known

1554.64 --> 1561.1200000000001
right you need to know astrology

1558.24 --> 1563.919
to figure out that like full moon has a

1561.12 --> 1566.559
weird influence on people

1563.919 --> 1569.1200000000001
that the setting of the moon is is

1566.559 --> 1571.84
influential

1569.12 --> 1571.84
right

1582.48 --> 1587.84
system tells you your abilities

1585.44 --> 1587.8400000000001
okay

1593.919 --> 1599.919
that's interesting terror306

1597.6 --> 1603.039
i'd love to get your astrological

1599.919 --> 1603.039
reading of me then

1604.799 --> 1610.96
and let's see what those abilities

1607.6 --> 1613.84
are assigned to me because of my

1610.96 --> 1613.8400000000001
astrology

1627.76 --> 1633.96
you don't want to use non-english words

1630.96 --> 1633.96
okay

1646.0 --> 1651.36
i'm just saying like i don't

1648.48 --> 1654.559
i try not to poo poo astrology but just

1651.36 --> 1657.4399999999998
like with numerology and gematria

1654.559 --> 1658.6399999999999
you got to be careful

1657.44 --> 1662.559
you can

1658.64 --> 1666.0
like basically lose focus on

1662.559 --> 1668.72
the other sides

1666.0 --> 1670.08
of spiritual things and life

1668.72 --> 1672.799
if you do that

1670.08 --> 1677.6399999999999
if you start to

1672.799 --> 1677.6399999999999
narrow everything down to one system

1686.48 --> 1690.799
dude what the [Â __Â ] is up with these

1688.32 --> 1690.799
trolls

1690.96 --> 1694.279
[Â __Â ] off

1699.17 --> 1706.8100000000002
[Music]

1716.399 --> 1718.7199999999998
what

1720.96 --> 1727.76
oh what right len yeah i think i already

1725.039 --> 1730.1589999999999
addressed that a couple of times

1727.76 --> 1731.679
yeah i do think that the the gregorian

1730.159 --> 1734.64
calendar did

1731.679 --> 1737.039
take away the 13th moon

1734.64 --> 1740.0800000000002
because it's kind of blatantly obvious

1737.039 --> 1742.0
that the year should be divided up in 13

1740.08 --> 1744.6399999999999
moons

1742.0 --> 1747.2
because that's how many moons there are

1744.64 --> 1747.2
in here

1750.96 --> 1758.0
so how i see it is they try to

1753.36 --> 1758.0
desynchronize from the moon cycles

1758.24 --> 1761.52
right

1759.76 --> 1764.1589999999999
which would

1761.52 --> 1767.76
yeah why would you do that

1764.159 --> 1769.48
well the disconnect from the cycles like

1767.76 --> 1771.919
in your

1769.48 --> 1774.0
numerological focus and just the numbers

1771.919 --> 1776.0800000000002
that you get confronted as you go about

1774.0 --> 1778.88
your business

1776.08 --> 1779.6789999999999
well if those numbers are attuned

1778.88 --> 1781.8400000000001
to

1779.679 --> 1783.52
well cycles

1781.84 --> 1785.84
then

1783.52 --> 1787.279
you will basically adapt to those cycles

1785.84 --> 1788.9599999999998
very easily

1787.279 --> 1791.2
with less

1788.96 --> 1794.159
friction less confusion

1791.2 --> 1795.919
and then stepping away from that cycle

1794.159 --> 1799.2
by changing it

1795.919 --> 1801.1200000000001
changing the yeah the number system

1799.2 --> 1803.919
the month system

1801.12 --> 1808.1999999999998
is then there to desynchronize

1803.919 --> 1808.2
that's the only logical conclusion

1809.559 --> 1816.1589999999999
desynchronization and probably oh my god

1812.48 --> 1818.159
they're so scared of 13 13 my lucky

1816.159 --> 1820.24
number

1818.159 --> 1824.5590000000002
officially

1820.24 --> 1824.559
and it is it really is my lucky number

1827.36 --> 1831.1589999999999
yeah they didn't like it

1839.919 --> 1844.5200000000002
what are you talking about akuma virus

1862.88 --> 1867.279
right

1865.44 --> 1869.279
separation it's

1867.279 --> 1871.44
the the right word is d

1869.279 --> 1873.36
synchronization

1871.44 --> 1875.919
right

1873.36 --> 1878.799
synchronize you attune to the pattern

1875.919 --> 1882.8400000000001
you synchronize well stepping away from

1878.799 --> 1882.84
such a pattern is desynchronization

2009.44 --> 2014.48

2011.919 --> 2017.7990000000002
i'm serious why why are you asking me

2014.48 --> 2017.799
that question

2045.76 --> 2050.32
serious questions for me and not just

2048.8 --> 2051.8790000000004

2050.32 --> 2055.52

2051.879 --> 2055.52

2066.56 --> 2072.96
just can you please just perhaps take

2069.76 --> 2074.8790000000004
what i do a little bit more serious and

2072.96 --> 2077.879

2152.4 --> 2158.7200000000003
although look the trinity

2155.2 --> 2161.2
is such a universal pattern it like you

2158.72 --> 2164.3999999999996
can fit anything in it

almost anything

god damn mike

2273.44 --> 2277.119
ugh

2275.04 --> 2278.32
i disagree i just want to say jado i

2277.119 --> 2280.8
disagree

2278.32 --> 2283.44
satan is not the hero of humanity

2280.8 --> 2285.6800000000003
he's just a functionary of god he's part

2283.44 --> 2289.44
of the design he fulfills a function

2285.68 --> 2292.0789999999997
he's not a hero he's not an enemy

2289.44 --> 2293.119
unless you make either

2292.079 --> 2297.0
of it

2293.119 --> 2297.0
and that is your own choice

2301.44 --> 2304.96
i see

2302.4 --> 2308.079
satan as an integral

2304.96 --> 2311.48
counter balancing part

2308.079 --> 2311.48
of our reality

2315.119 --> 2318.599
i'm not a hero

2336.079 --> 2339.119
he said the same thing about liz yeah

2338.16 --> 2341.92
but

2339.119 --> 2345.119
that's all just mixed up

2341.92 --> 2345.119
right goomba virus

2348.32 --> 2354.2000000000003
i mean lucifer is like the fallen angel

2355.599 --> 2361.3590000000004
satan is not that i don't think satan is

2358.72 --> 2363.839
actually a being i think it's a force i

2361.359 --> 2367.2799999999997
think it is a

2363.839 --> 2370.4
literally the shadow side

2367.28 --> 2370.4
of the human spirit

2374.24 --> 2378.0789999999997
so you could argue that

2380.24 --> 2382.8799999999997
satan

2381.68 --> 2384.8799999999997
bit

2382.88 --> 2385.92
adam

2384.88 --> 2387.359
and then

2385.92 --> 2388.88
adam had

2387.359 --> 2390.96
satan

2388.88 --> 2393.52
in them in him

2390.96 --> 2393.52
forever

2394.0 --> 2398.96
right it becomes a part of us it's the

2396.96 --> 2399.76
shadow side it's also associated with

2398.96 --> 2402.0
the

2399.76 --> 2403.28
original sin which is garbage has

2402.0 --> 2405.839
nothing to do with that it's not

2403.28 --> 2409.2000000000003
something that can be taken away it's a

2405.839 --> 2414.319
part of the design it's the design

2409.2 --> 2418.0
design satan is designed not by man

2414.319 --> 2421.04
but by the designer

2418.0 --> 2421.04
it is part of us

2422.079 --> 2426.4
and if you feed into it yeah it takes

2424.24 --> 2426.3999999999996
you

2435.28 --> 2439.0400000000004
right

2436.319 --> 2443.599
and hey i consider in a more esoteric

2439.04 --> 2445.2799999999997
fashion i consider satan to be literally

2443.599 --> 2446.7200000000003
the element

2445.28 --> 2449.52
of lying

2446.72 --> 2453.04
it's lies in itself

2449.52 --> 2455.44
as god in that setup is

2453.04 --> 2459.92
literally truth itself

2455.44 --> 2459.92
truthfulness like in all things

2460.96 --> 2464.48
well

2461.76 --> 2467.76
lying is

2464.48 --> 2470.079
part of us like you don't even have to

2467.76 --> 2474.4
grow up among liars

2470.079 --> 2474.4
to figure out as a kid how to lie

2476.4 --> 2480.2400000000002
kids learn to lie

2478.16 --> 2481.839
they just do they don't necessarily

2480.24 --> 2484.319
learn it from others

2481.839 --> 2486.99
although if others give them an example

2484.319 --> 2490.09
then they'll take it much easier right

3742.0 --> 3746.559
everything that exists in the realm

3744.96 --> 3749.039
that's that should be the real

3746.559 --> 3751.92

3749.039 --> 3751.92
to like a lot

3752.559 --> 3757.2000000000003
as well but

3755.2 --> 3760.0789999999997
because of where it's been used

3757.2 --> 3761.2799999999997
throughout history and throughout media

3760.079 --> 3763.92
it will

3761.28 --> 3766.4
first and foremost conjure up

3763.92 --> 3769.52
the idea of the heliocentric universe

3766.4 --> 3773.599
first that's always going to happen

3769.52 --> 3775.52
they basically laid claim to the word

3773.599 --> 3779.3590000000004
right and when you lay claim to the word

3775.52 --> 3781.7599999999998
by being the group with your model to

3779.359 --> 3783.92
use it all the time

3781.76 --> 3786.4
that way everybody starts to associate

3783.92 --> 3789.359
that word with that very specific model

3786.4 --> 3792.0
even though technically it hasn't

3789.359 --> 3793.2799999999997
no direct

3792.0 --> 3796.24
connection

3793.28 --> 3799.039
it was fought the connection was forced

3796.24 --> 3802.0789999999997
by being used in that field and people

3799.039 --> 3802.079
being exposed to it

3803.839 --> 3807.599
yeah

3804.799 --> 3810.0
so in the universe

3807.599 --> 3812.48
i like to say just in the realm or in

3810.0 --> 3812.48
the world

3813.44 --> 3817.119
because

3814.96 --> 3818.96
i know that is technically much more

3817.119 --> 3821.599
correct

3818.96 --> 3824.64
it is more specific more close by it

3821.599 --> 3829.319

3824.64 --> 3829.319
a heliocentric fictional cosmos

it prefers all matter and space that

3855.599 --> 3858.0
exists

3858.319 --> 3863.7599999999998
right but

3860.48 --> 3865.44
we can't speak for that because

3863.76 --> 3867.6800000000003
we don't know

3865.44 --> 3869.76
how much there is of it

3867.68 --> 3871.44
within our realm and we don't know if

3869.76 --> 3873.28
there is more

3871.44 --> 3877.319
that is somehow

3873.28 --> 3877.3190000000004
unconnected to us

3890.559 --> 3895.6800000000003
so yeah

3891.68 --> 3897.7599999999998
sure oh manner in space that exists

3895.68 --> 3900.24
fine

3897.76 --> 3902.7200000000003
but it's the word has been used

3900.24 --> 3903.7599999999998
by heliocentrism for a very long time

3902.72 --> 3906.9599999999996
and even

3903.76 --> 3909.92
even i myself will associate it first

3906.96 --> 3911.359
with the heliocentric universe it's like

3909.92 --> 3913.839
the visual

3911.359 --> 3918.92
that first pops in my mind where when i

3913.839 --> 3918.92
hear the word and i'm not the only one

[Music]

4016.24 --> 4020.5989999999997
sure

4017.119 --> 4020.599
i mean heliocentrism

4021.359 --> 4026.16
like what is that

4023.2 --> 4028.5589999999997
why do we use it it is really because it

4026.16 --> 4029.68
is the most evidentiary

4028.559 --> 4032.0
point

4029.68 --> 4033.52
in history when

4032.0 --> 4036.559
globe earth

4033.52 --> 4039.599
outer space universe cosmology was

4036.559 --> 4039.599
getting conjured

4039.76 --> 4045.3590000000004
right

4041.44 --> 4045.359
when he stepped away from the more

4045.96 --> 4050.799
metaphysical approach of like all the

4048.799 --> 4052.24
stars and the planets all surround the

4050.799 --> 4053.599
earth

4052.24 --> 4055.2799999999997
and

4053.599 --> 4058.48
we're at the center of the universe

4055.28 --> 4060.88
which is like not very literal right it

4058.48 --> 4063.2
is like sort of a metaphysical approach

4060.88 --> 4064.799
and then they just said no no it's the

4063.2 --> 4067.68
sun and now suddenly the earth was a

4064.799 --> 4070.4
ball around the sun bowl right

4067.68 --> 4073.359
that's where the real conjuring

4070.4 --> 4075.52
of the entire system

4073.359 --> 4078.16
that we know as heliocentrism starts

4075.52 --> 4081.0389999999998
that's why i say heliocentrism even

4078.16 --> 4084.64
though heliocentrism

4081.039 --> 4088.6400000000003
it's a very specific little switch in a

4084.64 --> 4090.799
giant sea of developments

4088.64 --> 4091.92
within this conjured philosophy

4090.799 --> 4096.039
i know

4091.92 --> 4096.039
i'm gonna call it heliocentrism

4101.12 --> 4107.5199999999995
analogical observations sun doesn't yeah

4104.0 --> 4109.44
sun doesn't have any distance

4107.52 --> 4113.799000000001
it's not an object in the literal

4109.44 --> 4113.799
position in euclidean space

i mean yeah the first two years oh yeah

4584.96 --> 4589.28
i just wanted to talk about that all the

4589.28 --> 4593.759999999999

4592.64 --> 4595.76
yeah

4593.76 --> 4599.12
i've been talking about it teaching

4595.76 --> 4601.52
things about it for so long it's like

4599.12 --> 4603.44
at some point a teacher that is a

4601.52 --> 4606.4800000000005
specialty in something is not going to

4603.44 --> 4609.199
be compulsive anymore to to teach others

4606.48 --> 4611.199
about it because he's constantly doing

4609.199 --> 4612.719
it

4611.199 --> 4615.599999999999
right

4612.719 --> 4615.6
constantly

4616.719 --> 4620.4
so

4618.56 --> 4622.320000000001
i do bring it up

4620.4 --> 4625.04
like if people are getting to know me

4622.32 --> 4626.639999999999
then they i have to at some point start

4625.04 --> 4629.76
bringing that up

4626.64 --> 4631.84
i think they can handle it

4629.76 --> 4632.719
right not gonna just bring that up right

4631.84 --> 4635.84
away

4632.719 --> 4637.84

4635.84 --> 4640.2390000000005
they if they're just not

4637.84 --> 4641.6
interested not everybody is interested

4640.239 --> 4644.718999999999
in all that

4641.6 --> 4646.88
then i just don't bring it up anymore

4644.719 --> 4648.96
right i only really

4646.88 --> 4653.4800000000005
talk to people about flat earth when

4648.96 --> 4653.4800000000005

4893.12 --> 4896.48
that

4893.92 --> 4899.84
it's a lot of math

4896.48 --> 4902.799999999999
a lot of thought experimentation

4899.84 --> 4905.4400000000005
and the twisting of yeah natural

4902.8 --> 4905.4400000000005

4906.0 --> 4911.44
it is probably the most elaborate most

4908.8 --> 4914.08
detailed deception

4911.44 --> 4916.638999999999
because just the way it works it spreads

4914.08 --> 4919.84

4919.84 --> 4923.1990000000005

they're just mimicking the freaking

4953.199 --> 4958.799999999999

4955.92 --> 4962.88
they're just

4958.8 --> 4965.1990000000005
just creating more nightmares

4962.88 --> 4967.6

4965.199 --> 4971.04
they're just gonna unleash

4967.6 --> 4974.159000000001
just to create more fear to get more

4971.04 --> 4976.96

china is going to do a alien and a fake

4979.84 --> 4985.28
alien invasion has anybody ever even

4982.719 --> 4988.0

4985.28 --> 4990.32
that they might not give a [Â __Â ]

4988.0 --> 4992.56

4990.32 --> 4994.799999999999

4992.56 --> 4998.2390000000005

don't even look humans

5002.56 --> 5006.400000000001

like teleport

we're gonna get really weird

5099.36 --> 5103.36
the worst they could do is basically

5104.159 --> 5107.36
have people

5105.36 --> 5109.839999999999
like use

5107.36 --> 5113.12
controlled psychotropics to basically

5109.84 --> 5116.96
enter the body of the other dimension

5113.12 --> 5119.12

5116.96 --> 5121.04
like do

5119.12 --> 5122.96
ufo formation

5121.04 --> 5125.28
because that is a thing apparently you

5122.96 --> 5127.679
literally can fly around like a ufo and

5125.28 --> 5130.88
that is apparently sometimes visible in

the real world it's really weird

5130.88 --> 5136.08
i have no personal confirmation it's

5133.36 --> 5138.0
just the thing that's apparently there

5136.08 --> 5140.48
well they might use that so if there's

5138.0 --> 5144.159
going to be whoa surreal alien invasion

that

5166.56 --> 5172.080000000001
it's either an illusion

5287.12 --> 5292.4
going to be through overt war

5290.08 --> 5296.4
that could work right away

5292.4 --> 5296.4
i mean they got a lot of manpower but

5297.04 --> 5300.88
right china is going to do on average

5299.199 --> 5304.879999999999
more damage

5300.88 --> 5304.88
outside of war than in war

5305.36 --> 5308.96
because

5306.32 --> 5311.12
they've just become extremely efficient

5308.96 --> 5314.4800000000005
in like financial and psychological

5311.12 --> 5314.48
warfare type things

5315.76 --> 5321.12
much better than actual war

5318.08 --> 5321.12
i mean they are not

5321.28 --> 5325.92
a war nation that's never been the case

5326.0 --> 5331.56
because powers were always in finance

5328.4 --> 5331.5599999999995
and industry

5350.639 --> 5357.719
but it's gonna come i i'm waiting for it

5354.719 --> 5357.719
right

5381.41 --> 5384.5689999999995

5433.199 --> 5436.5599999999995
enough to see that day

5441.679 --> 5445.76
and besides

5442.96 --> 5446.96
even if judgment day arrives

5445.76 --> 5450.08
like

5446.96 --> 5453.199
what does that even imply like should i

5450.08 --> 5455.5199999999995
give something about everybody

5453.199 --> 5457.5199999999995
that's gonna be judged

5455.52 --> 5459.1990000000005

5457.52 --> 5462.2390000000005
people that i've actually become a

5459.199 --> 5463.599999999999
little invested in that i hope

5462.239 --> 5464.4
welfare

5463.6 --> 5466.320000000001
will

5464.4 --> 5468.159

5472.32 --> 5476.5599999999995
is good

5474.719 --> 5478.719
they've overcome a lot of their mistakes

5476.56 --> 5478.719
that

5479.04 --> 5484.44
you know recognize me for what i am

5501.84 --> 5506.08

5523.199 --> 5525.12
even

5524.08 --> 5527.199
i mean

5525.12 --> 5530.4
it doesn't happen at times when i'm like

5527.199 --> 5532.719
really freaking pissed off and yelling

5530.4 --> 5534.719
on the show and all that and nothing

5543.76 --> 5548.56
but now yesterday oh my god yesterday's

5546.32 --> 5549.92

as long as you know it's a bow and not

5579.44 --> 5584.5599999999995
ask is that a crossbow that's the point

5582.48 --> 5586.4
and by the way there was somebody in my

5584.56 --> 5590.2390000000005
chat here

5586.4 --> 5592.5599999999995
that asked that i get annoyed with them

5590.239 --> 5594.799999999999
and then i move on

5592.56 --> 5596.56
and then they should recognize that i

5594.8 --> 5598.400000000001
get annoyed by that and then hey if

5596.56 --> 5599.92
somebody asked kind of

5598.4 --> 5601.759999999999
asks that

5599.92 --> 5604.8
they'll be able to tell them like dude

5601.76 --> 5604.8
it's a bow just

5605.199 --> 5608.638999999999
right

5606.32 --> 5610.159
like what is the problem here there is

5608.639 --> 5613.6
no problem

5610.159 --> 5617.679
it's just constant imaginary conjuring

5613.6 --> 5620.320000000001
up of problems and complications

5617.679 --> 5622.4
out of nothing out of nowhere

5620.32 --> 5624.639
from people that don't even show their

5622.4 --> 5624.638999999999
face

5627.679 --> 5633.4400000000005
like are you all that desperate i mean

5630.32 --> 5634.48
does the continuation of what i do

5633.44 --> 5635.678999999999
like

5634.48 --> 5638.718999999999
does that

5635.679 --> 5641.28
imply your imminent demise

5638.719 --> 5643.44
like are you going to die if you don't

5641.28 --> 5646.719
stop nagging me

5643.44 --> 5648.96
is that what this is i mean could be

5646.719 --> 5651.04
i've made a couple of remarks about

5648.96 --> 5654.08
certain types of individuals out there

5651.04 --> 5656.08
yeah you might be family right

5654.08 --> 5658.48
you might be their family and you're

5656.08 --> 5661.199
[Â __Â ] so you're gonna be a little piece

5658.48 --> 5663.599999999999
of [Â __Â ] demon and try to ruin everything

5661.199 --> 5665.199
in the hopes that they'll get away with

5663.6 --> 5668.8
it and then you get

5665.199 --> 5670.32
you get to be a special boy some more

5668.8 --> 5673.1990000000005
yeah

5670.32 --> 5675.5199999999995
coming for you

5673.199 --> 5675.5199999999995
huh

5676.0 --> 5679.6
so i get it if that's you right if

5678.08 --> 5681.119
you're like

5679.6 --> 5684.2390000000005
trying to

5681.119 --> 5688.96
still uphold and defend

5684.239 --> 5692.0
your political regime of satan

5688.96 --> 5694.0
then i understand why you're stalking me

5692.0 --> 5695.76
if you're not if you're not involved in

5694.0 --> 5697.6
any of that then i don't know what the

5695.76 --> 5699.4400000000005
hell you're even doing here

5697.6 --> 5702.8
why would you waste all your time and

5699.44 --> 5704.48
energy on nonsense like that

5702.8 --> 5706.8
you are then

5704.48 --> 5709.36
completely insane so i think that there

5706.8 --> 5710.88
is agency behind it i think that some of

5709.36 --> 5712.799999999999
these guys

5710.88 --> 5714.96
they do typically fall into a certain

5712.8 --> 5717.92
profile i think a lot of them are

5714.96 --> 5721.76
actually kids

5717.92 --> 5724.4800000000005
of world economic economic forum

5721.76 --> 5727.360000000001
globalist types it's probably kids of

5724.48 --> 5731.199
people that completely corrupted towards

5727.36 --> 5733.599999999999
satan and they know everything

5731.199 --> 5735.44
their family is doing is going to lead

5733.6 --> 5738.56
to death

5735.44 --> 5740.839999999999
and they are responsible for it too as

5738.56 --> 5744.080000000001
kids because they

5740.84 --> 5746.0
know would like to be reminded

5744.08 --> 5749.6
that it's going to lead

5746.0 --> 5753.04
to their inevitable demise and like

5749.6 --> 5755.6
huge humiliation and destruction

5753.04 --> 5757.679
everything you had

5755.6 --> 5761.52
that you didn't deserve because you

5757.679 --> 5764.8
corrupted you corrupted for satan

5761.52 --> 5764.8
and you were born in that

5765.52 --> 5770.080000000001
i think a lot of kids

5768.159 --> 5772.239
from those types of families are ones

5770.08 --> 5774.08
that are stalking me

5772.239 --> 5776.239
they have the most to lose you see

5774.08 --> 5780.08
they're going to lose everything because

5776.239 --> 5782.4
of their parents stupidity everything

5780.08 --> 5785.679
they'll be hated they'll not have the

5782.4 --> 5789.119
right education they'll have nothing and

5785.679 --> 5789.119
they won't be happy

5792.08 --> 5797.36
well

5794.32 --> 5799.199
stalking people that are going to speak

5797.36 --> 5801.599999999999
the truth and

5799.199 --> 5804.0
lay out exactly what is going to happen

5801.6 --> 5805.119000000001
and give it an extra push to hurry it up

5804.0 --> 5806.56
yeah

5805.119 --> 5809.44
yeah yeah you could

5806.56 --> 5812.56
nag those people you could nag me

5809.44 --> 5814.159
get in my face demoralize me

5812.56 --> 5817.1990000000005
bully me

5814.159 --> 5820.0
yeah guess what's gonna happen

5817.199 --> 5822.32
to accelerate then

5820.0 --> 5826.56
because i can

5822.32 --> 5829.759999999999
i can accelerate i can make it worse

5826.56 --> 5829.76
can make it faster

5830.159 --> 5835.36
yeah haven't you noticed haven't you

5832.32 --> 5837.28
noticed how things are speeding up now

5835.36 --> 5839.759999999999
huh

5837.28 --> 5840.8
so why'd you come for me push me some

5839.76 --> 5842.96
more

5840.8 --> 5845.4400000000005
and i'll push it some more let's see

5842.96 --> 5848.96
what's gonna happen in the world huh

5845.44 --> 5850.08
why'd you try me out [Â __Â ]

5848.96 --> 5853.8
big ass

5850.08 --> 5853.8
big mouth [Â __Â ]

5854.8 --> 5857.679
just

5855.84 --> 5861.04
get over it

5857.679 --> 5863.76
start a life separate from your satanic

5861.04 --> 5866.08
parents that are doing this

5863.76 --> 5870.159000000001
like completely disconnect from them and

5866.08 --> 5870.159
you will be so happy about it

5870.4 --> 5874.638999999999
you won't have to take the fall

5873.04 --> 5876.159
when they get

5874.639 --> 5880.639
like

5876.159 --> 5880.638999999999
into real trouble go to prison die

5880.8 --> 5884.88
you don't have to be part of that

5883.199 --> 5886.4
but if you're going to stay there

5884.88 --> 5888.4800000000005
expecting

5886.4 --> 5891.759999999999
to one day

5888.48 --> 5893.839999999999
lay claim on all their stolen

5891.76 --> 5896.320000000001
robbed riches

5893.84 --> 5898.2390000000005
then you're probably going gonna burn

5896.32 --> 5900.88
with them you see

5898.239 --> 5903.04
it's better to step away

5900.88 --> 5904.0
and completely separate yourself from

5903.04 --> 5906.159
them

5904.0 --> 5908.0
start alive grassroots

5906.159 --> 5911.44
actually set roots

5908.0 --> 5914.0
in the place where you live

5911.44 --> 5915.5199999999995
village with the people the other people

5914.0 --> 5917.199
that are there that are actually doing

5915.52 --> 5921.040000000001
their best that are

5917.199 --> 5921.04
trying to keep to their senses

5921.84 --> 5926.4800000000005
it's much better course of action than

5923.76 --> 5931.04
to just waste your time in your life

5926.48 --> 5932.959999999999
miserable with a terrible outlook

5931.04 --> 5933.76
nagging people

5932.96 --> 5936.08
that

5933.76 --> 5938.159000000001
somehow threaten that

5936.08 --> 5940.48
supposed

5938.159 --> 5943.5199999999995
outlook you have that's going to end

5940.48 --> 5943.5199999999995
very miserably

5943.76 --> 5949.84
yeah truly truly boys

5947.04 --> 5949.84
you get it now

5950.48 --> 5956.32
you could still get out of this

5953.52 --> 5959.360000000001
you don't have to suffer the same fate

5956.32 --> 5963.4
as your [Â __Â ] up parents you see

5959.36 --> 5963.4
you don't have to do that

5969.69 --> 5976.889999999999

6006.88 --> 6010.639
have to see their faces

6009.119 --> 6013.599999999999
all i need

6010.639 --> 6016.719
is a little bit of intention

6013.6 --> 6018.2390000000005
and then i literally dive

6016.719 --> 6020.159
with my spirit
