2.659 --> 9.99
good morning everyone welcome to flat

8.7 --> 15.509
earth early-bird

9.99 --> 18.27
9 and I am Arwen your host sorry for

15.509 --> 23.789
being a little bit late I tried to make

18.27 --> 26.279
a 45-minute errant run in 30 minutes and

23.789 --> 32.160000000000004
that didn't quite work out so now I know

26.279 --> 34.62
that yeah quite late so this is gonna be

32.16 --> 38.01
a short show but hopefully we can still

34.62 --> 41.218999999999994
get something out of it see it was in

38.01 --> 47.218999999999994
chat when Thorsen Daniel field Shin

41.219 --> 52.61
Walter grab it hard flat ball and Truman

47.219 --> 52.61
arty Marie so yeah thank you for joining

54.14 --> 62.789
yeah I've had a very busy morning and

57.68 --> 65.67
early afternoon so let's see I had hoped

62.789 --> 68.159
that I had opened up the panel for a

65.67 --> 71.549
while I had hoped that somebody would

68.159 --> 78.74000000000001
join in the mean time unfortunately that

71.549 --> 83.52000000000001
doesn't seem to be the case well so

78.74 --> 88.11
let's see a Rasta so if any of you want

83.52 --> 93.03
to join please do so otherwise it's

88.11 --> 95.78999999999999
gonna be just me and I still have to get

93.03 --> 98.07000000000001
myself together I really just came

95.79 --> 99.60000000000001
running up here and started up the

98.07 --> 106.67999999999999
Hangout pretty much as quickly as

99.6 --> 112.04899999999999
possible talk about a lot just actually

106.68 --> 114.68900000000001
remember it out huh yeah I had a very

112.049 --> 120.53
interesting conversation over Skype with

114.689 --> 120.52999999999999
a new guy was apparently a 17 year old

121.729 --> 129.75
student of physics I think very long

127.14 --> 132.59
conversation was very interesting I had

129.75 --> 139.22
all kinds of he was a flat earther

132.59 --> 141.44
he said so at least but Andrew Baker

139.22 --> 144.65
this is name doesn't mind me sharing

141.44 --> 148.4
that but he offered to come on to the

144.65 --> 150.87900000000002
show today so maybe because I'm late he

148.4 --> 153.769
thought okay I'm gonna do something else

150.879 --> 155.81
otherwise maybe he'll notice this and

153.769 --> 167.06
then join the show that would be very

155.81 --> 168.61
nice yeah we talked about lots he was

167.06 --> 171.94
especially interested in my

168.61 --> 176.66000000000003
conceptualization of gravity the

171.94 --> 180.65
apparent downward acceleration force

176.66 --> 182.599
this equilibrium that is classified in

180.65 --> 186.5
aberration and we also talked about the

182.599 --> 189.61999999999998
apparent Sun and even the ether and how

186.5 --> 192.92
many things seem to be classified in

189.62 --> 195.5
aberrations once you can't really prove

192.92 --> 198.35
their cause and their nature that's

195.5 --> 202.25
really funny thing there's more than

198.35 --> 206.209
just gravity as an aberration daylight

202.25 --> 210.41
and the night light from moon also our

206.209 --> 213.26
aberrations basically and the ether is

210.41 --> 217.4
an aberration absolutely very very

213.26 --> 223.32899999999998
similar in nature same type of symptoms

217.4 --> 226.31
and aberrations all over the place

223.329 --> 228.95000000000002
because there is so much that we can

226.31 --> 231.23
perceive and that we can deduce but to

228.95 --> 236.72
scientifically prove something it

231.23 --> 241.39999999999998
requires very solid foundations and yeah

236.72 --> 242.66
it's just very hard to figure out all

241.4 --> 245.93
these aberrations

242.66 --> 249.049
although yeah as technology progresses

245.93 --> 254.48000000000002
and new things are discovered we might

249.049 --> 257.539
find new elements like missing fields

254.48 --> 259.519
that are just like an extra dimensional

257.539 --> 261.169
puzzle piece that was missing before

259.519 --> 263.81
because we just didn't see it

261.169 --> 265.83
that could actually bring a whole new

263.81 --> 269.78000000000003
light on all kinds of

265.83 --> 272.21999999999997
operations giving us an ability to

269.78 --> 276.21
potentially prove it scientifically so

272.22 --> 278.34000000000003
who knows where things will go and oh

276.21 --> 281.28
yeah the guy was especially interested

278.34 --> 285.78
in electricity and he was talking a lot

281.28 --> 289.19899999999996
about polarization and that seems to be

285.78 --> 291.98999999999995
one of his research fields at the moment

289.199 --> 295.02000000000004
so hopefully he'll still join and we can

291.99 --> 297.96000000000004
talk about that cuz probably knows a lot

295.02 --> 301.02
more detail than I do he's studying it

297.96 --> 307.229
pretty much right now and yeah we also

301.02 --> 310.44
talked about the physical laws and how

307.229 --> 312.289
science especially micro science the

310.44 --> 315.9
subatomic science has become so

312.289 --> 317.99
convoluted declaring light a particle

315.9 --> 323.19
with weight and declaring electrons

317.99 --> 326.58
particles with weight well they're not

323.19 --> 330.81
so straightforward it's again like

326.58 --> 334.169
gravity a mechanism to make a structure

330.81 --> 337.11
work in a functional way doesn't mean

334.169 --> 339.9
that these assumptions are all

337.11 --> 343.889
definitive it just works within that

339.9 --> 347.9
mechanism how electrons considered part

343.889 --> 352.469
yea particles that join matter and then

347.9 --> 355.52
can also detach itself from the protons

352.469 --> 359.49
and neutrons and become electricity and

355.52 --> 362.06899999999996
light kind of in the same way and yep

359.49 --> 365.779
it's a fascinating concept but even when

362.069 --> 369.36
you think about electrons like you know

365.779 --> 372.05
electrons have interactions with the

369.36 --> 376.319
formations of matter with chemistry

372.05 --> 379.229
somehow that electricity is involved but

376.319 --> 381.75
to then assume that because as a part of

379.229 --> 385.68
matter it is more likely to be a

381.75 --> 388.319
particle that it is also a particle when

385.68 --> 391.259
it actually separate from matter it's

388.319 --> 393.3
not attached well who knows if that even

391.259 --> 398.7
is the case because maybe like light as

393.3 --> 402.3
I currently assume it is like a

398.7 --> 405.32
it's a tray it's like an ark it's

402.3 --> 410.01
something that instantly is everywhere

405.32 --> 413.84999999999997
simultaneously in like a pattern maybe

410.01 --> 415.34999999999997
electricity is kind of similar but

413.85 --> 418.92
different maybe a different frequency

415.35 --> 423.0
but who knows if it is like separate

418.92 --> 426.27000000000004
particles that do things when it is

423.0 --> 428.64
roaming free are we really

426.27 --> 432.12
absolutely foundationally certain that

428.64 --> 435.09
that is the case can we beyond any

432.12 --> 439.56
reasonable doubt determine that it is so

435.09 --> 445.4
I don't think so so yeah interesting

439.56 --> 447.48
things to ponder on and yeah that's

445.4 --> 454.90999999999997
pretty much what we were talking about

447.48 --> 454.91
yesterday so let me see what's going on

456.56 --> 460.83
all right people are asking what's on my

459.12 --> 462.48
wall yeah I've been having this on my

460.83 --> 462.93
wall since the first letters the

462.48 --> 469.32
earlybird

462.93 --> 471.62
it's a bow and arrows and they work so

469.32 --> 471.62
yeah

479.94 --> 496.75
yeah these are not highly specialized

489.1 --> 501.57000000000005
but functional arrows I'm not sure if

496.75 --> 505.21
they're steel could be or they're like

501.57 --> 510.04
some kind of alloy anyway yeah these are

505.21 --> 515.05
arrows they work and so does the bow

510.04 --> 517.15
although it's a very strong but it's not

515.05 --> 520.26
a light one but yeah that gives it even

517.15 --> 520.26
the more power so

527.1 --> 535.64
I have to keep up with the elfin

534.54 --> 538.8399999999999
tradition

535.64 --> 538.84
[Music]

542.18 --> 548.4499999999999
yeah sure went out to you

544.89 --> 553.28
who knows they're not Silvertip so

548.45 --> 553.2800000000001
although technically if I have my

553.49 --> 558.42
goldsmithing workshop I could

555.66 --> 567.26
potentially make silver tips I want to

558.42 --> 574.9799999999999
do but it's rather a improvised

567.26 --> 576.33
self-defense mechanism you know and who

574.98 --> 578.91
cares about the bow

576.33 --> 581.88
it's about as long as I don't do crazy

578.91 --> 584.8199999999999
things with it then people won't even

581.88 --> 593.25
take notice so that's fine and I don't

584.82 --> 596.36
do crazy things with it so okay we're

593.25 --> 596.36
halfway the hour

597.17 --> 604.3499999999999
nine minutes into the show I sorry again

600.3 --> 609.03
for being late I'm still open for guests

604.35 --> 615.8100000000001
so please if you can and want to add me

609.03 --> 618.27
on skype and yeah I trust you know if

615.81 --> 621.2399999999999
I'm desperate enough I guess I

618.27 --> 624.3
yeah I'm my ascend to hang out link to

621.24 --> 629.39
the show and we can have a conversation

624.3 --> 630.5999999999999
about anything as long as it's not too

629.39 --> 636.59
dark

630.6 --> 640.97
please Oh Sean Tibet's

636.59 --> 640.97
welcome to flat earth early bird nine

646.88 --> 654.48
what else can I tell ya or other things

651.99 --> 658.2
that are currently on my mind are very

654.48 --> 660.26
much my mighty indie game oh yeah

658.2 --> 665.07
and that was interesting right way

660.26 --> 672.5699999999999
another note I have posted there was an

665.07 --> 675.96
article nine four news again and yeah

672.57 --> 680.22
about consciousness and there apparently

675.96 --> 683.3100000000001
are now some scientists at least

680.22 --> 686.84
thinkers organizations that are

683.31 --> 692.3699999999999
considering is a concept that is very

686.84 --> 697.11
very close to my own saying basically

692.37 --> 699.74
that the spirit is like a or D

697.11 --> 702.12
consciousness is a side effect of become

699.74 --> 705.96
complicated structure izing of matter

702.12 --> 709.92
like an extra dimensional side effect

705.96 --> 712.9200000000001
and that's well that is basically how I

709.92 --> 716.7299999999999
approach it I consider consciousness and

712.92 --> 720.4499999999999
the spirit to be throning our bodies to

716.73 --> 723.9300000000001
be throwning matter and also to be able

720.45 --> 729.1800000000001
to be detached under certain conditions

723.93 --> 733.77
so yeah I like I like that and I posted

729.18 --> 735.8399999999999
about it that I totally agreed and the

733.77 --> 739.89
funny thing was I just decided you know

735.84 --> 744.8100000000001
what I'm gonna post a very old link to

739.89 --> 748.4399999999999
my old websites symbolic Staten L which

744.81 --> 749.9699999999999
I made in 2006 when I was in the middle

748.44 --> 753.69
of my I basically made it for my

749.97 --> 756.69
goldsmithing but I had was theorizing

753.69 --> 758.7
and about spiritual stuff a lot and I

756.69 --> 760.3100000000001
wrote down a lot of stuff also in

758.7 --> 763.11
English by the way translated everything

760.31 --> 768.39
suppose in Dutch in English it is

763.11 --> 771.1800000000001
somewhat old so yeah the problem is I

768.39 --> 774.84
can't properly re-edit that site because

771.18 --> 776.8499999999999
the software to edit it has become

774.84 --> 779.52
outdated and it's like a closed system

776.85 --> 781.83
so it's kind of

779.52 --> 783.66
outdated in the way it's written I could

781.83 --> 786.0300000000001
see a lot of improvements but the

783.66 --> 789.6899999999999
technical things that I was working with

786.03 --> 794.4599999999999
them are still just every time I look at

789.69 --> 796.98
it I'm just like wow if I had known if I

794.46 --> 800.2800000000001
had truly understand the details of what

796.98 --> 802.5
I was seeing I would be even more amazed

800.28 --> 806.43
than it was back then because I was

802.5 --> 809.76
really onto some things on that side a

806.43 --> 815.16
lot of things actually and a particular

809.76 --> 830.43
piece was let me see it just presented

815.16 --> 836.99
you know let's do that yeah I called it

830.43 --> 840.8399999999999
God's demons in life and it's about how

836.99 --> 843.99
life and consciousness came into being

840.84 --> 847.85
like a creationist story from an

843.99 --> 852.27
ethereal perspective so this is my side

847.85 --> 855.03
and it's still small format because that

852.27 --> 855.4499999999999
was the standard of that time still

855.03 --> 858.03
works

855.45 --> 862.23
I can appreciate how the designer made

858.03 --> 865.0799999999999
it very much how I wanted it according

862.23 --> 869.04
to my instructions that anyway this yeah

865.08 --> 872.4000000000001
if you see the pictures you can pretty

869.04 --> 875.4599999999999
much see that consider the black region

872.4 --> 878.18
to be the dimension of matter and white

875.46 --> 883.1700000000001
the dimension of energy and

878.18 --> 887.4599999999999
consciousness and yeah I guess because

883.17 --> 890.13
of entropy but including the spirit or

887.46 --> 893.52
spiritual variety that like

890.13 --> 900.87
interconnects both and where the the god

893.52 --> 903.6899999999999
entities I call them so not like the

900.87 --> 907.53
Creator itself but like B I guess the

903.69 --> 909.6
Elohim the the manifestations the

907.53 --> 912.99
separate manifestation of certain

909.6 --> 916.8000000000001
characters that are very much in tune

912.99 --> 920.3100000000001
the total yeah they spring into being

916.8 --> 923.25
and so does life live in consciousness

920.31 --> 927.4499999999999
human consciousness and eventually how

923.25 --> 929.58
the interaction also cause the demons to

927.45 --> 931.32
come into being as a contrast as a

929.58 --> 935.45
yin-yang affective and those are

931.32 --> 941.4300000000001
represented by the ball the black and

935.45 --> 944.1
yeah this just is a story very it's in a

941.43 --> 946.8299999999999
vague type description I guess compared

944.1 --> 950.94
to how I do things now explaining like

946.83 --> 952.7700000000001
yeah how did that happen and why well

950.94 --> 955.5500000000001
anyway this is theory based on the

952.77 --> 957.72
pattern concept and that is very

955.55 --> 961.02
hilariously enough it's kind of similar

957.72 --> 963.24
to math proof to reality which is

961.02 --> 968.54
absolutely stupid of course but in this

963.24 --> 972.1800000000001
sense I say the pattern is a structure

968.54 --> 976.29
Inc like a pattern there is a pattern to

972.18 --> 979.8599999999999
the entirety of all reality and creation

976.29 --> 981.649
it is all structured according to a

979.86 --> 984.899
pattern and this pattern is so

981.649 --> 987.72
incredibly confessed and complex and

984.899 --> 991.529
maybe turn out to be incredibly simple

987.72 --> 993.72
even but it is a pattern and that is how

991.529 --> 994.35
everything is and why everything is the

993.72 --> 998.0600000000001
way it is

994.35 --> 1000.95
that is like a foundational concept of

998.06 --> 1002.9899999999999
yeah what I was working on and I kind of

1000.95 --> 1005.4200000000001
still believe that there's not really a

1002.99 --> 1010.25
lot to disprove it and hey everything

1005.42 --> 1012.74
has patterns so it reminded me the

1010.25 --> 1017.14
concept reminded was based on and

1012.74 --> 1020.12
reminded me of the nature of a fractal

1017.14 --> 1023.0889999999999
like okay life seems to be kind of based

1020.12 --> 1029.62
on fractals crystallization is like

1023.089 --> 1033.29
fractals and it entropy change over time

1029.62 --> 1036.589
development seems to be fractals so yeah

1033.29 --> 1040.37
everything is one giant pattern just

1036.589 --> 1043.01
very hard for a part of the pattern to

1040.37 --> 1047.3799999999999
actually understand the whole thing it's

1043.01 --> 1047.3799999999999
kind of similar to the saying

1047.92 --> 1055.52
if the brain was simple enough that we

1052.79 --> 1059.75
could understand it we would be too

1055.52 --> 1063.46
stupid to understand anything it's kind

1059.75 --> 1067.9
of in the same yeah this is the same

1063.46 --> 1070.46
effect I guess anyway yeah

1067.9 --> 1073.67
digging back in old stuff there's so

1070.46 --> 1079.3700000000001
much theory I was working on the effects

1073.67 --> 1082.67
of shapes reincarnation and how that

1079.37 --> 1086.03
supposedly works in my opinions back

1082.67 --> 1088.19
then I haven't really dug much further

1086.03 --> 1090.68
than I did back then although of course

1088.19 --> 1092.45
the subject could have massive

1090.68 --> 1096.73
expansions to it but I never really

1092.45 --> 1099.46
focused on that a lot oh yeah they're my

1096.73 --> 1103.01
reinterpretation of the four elements

1099.46 --> 1104.6000000000001
the four elements of life the body the

1103.01 --> 1108.71
spirit the soul and the consciousness

1104.6 --> 1112.49
and yeah I wrote a little bit about that

1108.71 --> 1117.23
it's 2008 and what else

1112.49 --> 1119.06
yeah the dimensions the total dimensions

1117.23 --> 1125.56
of reality and the funny thing is here

1119.06 --> 1130.4299999999998
you see my 10 star and it is actually a

1125.56 --> 1134.6299999999999
serial dimensional map of the complete

1130.43 --> 1139.04
reality and all its dimensions and it's

1134.63 --> 1143.0600000000002
it's a conceptualization and it has a

1139.04 --> 1145.07
very overarching meaning so yeah its

1143.06 --> 1147.97
conceptualized that there's the material

1145.07 --> 1151.1299999999999
realm in the outer part then there's the

1147.97 --> 1156.08
astral plane or the spiritual plane

1151.13 --> 1158.66
I guess that is well that I experiences

1156.08 --> 1162.29
the dark world then there is the source

1158.66 --> 1166.3400000000001
which is where the energy comes from

1162.29 --> 1171.83
basically and then outside or inside all

1166.34 --> 1173.9599999999998
of it is the oneness like something it's

1171.83 --> 1178.4399999999998
always been kind of mysterious to me I

1173.96 --> 1181.5
had seen some things but

1178.44 --> 1184.2
it is detached it is completely detached

1181.5 --> 1186.12
from it all and I speculate purely

1184.2 --> 1189.0900000000001
theoretically speculate so this is

1186.12 --> 1192.4499999999998
almost getting into heliocentric type

1189.09 --> 1196.6699999999998
thinking way out there but in my

1192.45 --> 1199.8300000000002
spiritual cosmology that the one is

1196.67 --> 1205.13
basically the creator it is detached and

1199.83 --> 1212.6299999999999
it is the source of the manifestation of

1205.13 --> 1216.66
it all and that it created all that to

1212.63 --> 1218.69
experience well it is it would be kind

1216.66 --> 1221.4
of the creator I guess but not

1218.69 --> 1224.04
conceptualized as an entity although I

1221.4 --> 1226.74
speculate also that if one would be

1224.04 --> 1228.99
spiritually confronted with it as some

1226.74 --> 1231.57
people have told me they were when I

1228.99 --> 1236.8700000000001
explained the concept that they would

1231.57 --> 1240.1799999999998
see whatever they deemed as God so

1236.87 --> 1243.6899999999998
anyway this is all super super ethereal

1240.18 --> 1247.41
and yeah let's try and prove that good

1243.69 --> 1254.6000000000001
luck to me so but yeah still very

1247.41 --> 1257.88
interesting and for me it gives some

1254.6 --> 1261.4699999999998
some grip to some of the experience that

1257.88 --> 1265.14
I've been through anyway yeah that's me

1261.47 --> 1270.59
talking about things I was working in in

1265.14 --> 1277.3400000000001
the past if you want to look it up

1270.59 --> 1277.34
it's no

1279.929 --> 1283.6490000000001
a lot of it Tyrael Zand magic stuff and

1282.96 --> 1287.519
yeah

1283.649 --> 1289.61
I was not Christian back then you have

1287.519 --> 1292.559
to take that into mind and I had still

1289.61 --> 1294.84
and I guess anti-christian sympathies

1292.559 --> 1298.23
and though I didn't really express them

1294.84 --> 1301.649
out loud a lot you do see that here and

1298.23 --> 1304.32
there which I would prefer to now

1301.649 --> 1308.2489999999998
rephrase there's a lot better way to

1304.32 --> 1310.32
describe the need for certain things and

1308.249 --> 1312.1490000000001
to describe the changes that are

1310.32 --> 1314.49
actually happening in the world because

1312.149 --> 1317.399
I understand that's a lot better now I

1314.49 --> 1320.249
didn't really know I didn't really

1317.399 --> 1324.2099999999998
socialize with a lot of people back then

1320.249 --> 1327.119
and didn't really know how to size up

1324.21 --> 1328.95
people as well as I can now so I've

1327.119 --> 1338.279
changed a lot it's not that strange

1328.95 --> 1340.47
spend like 12 years so anyway the

1338.279 --> 1343.499
peanuts Clarke in chat chocolates say

1340.47 --> 1346.409
and hello dude and got a switch Bella to

1343.499 --> 1349.519
see you matrix media flat earth

1346.409 --> 1349.519
questionnaire array

1350.43 --> 1353.8790000000001
[Music]

1351.59 --> 1359.85
yeah if any of you still want to join

1353.879 --> 1362.49
these last 40 I mean last 15 minutes I

1359.85 --> 1367.1689999999999
guess please be my guest

1362.49 --> 1370.549
literally and otherwise you're just

1367.169 --> 1370.5490000000002
going to be me rambling on

1376.29 --> 1387.73
yes yeah you know what I've been

1385.81 --> 1391.09
thinking about it carefully and I think

1387.73 --> 1396.7
I have three different subjects for Flat

1391.09 --> 1400.05
Earth talks now and I might make one

1396.7 --> 1403.42
long or two separate hangouts about them

1400.05 --> 1406.8999999999999
still have yeah basically and still have

1403.42 --> 1409.69
to put things to paper and then flatten

1406.9 --> 1412.51
it out again but yeah I'm pretty sure

1409.69 --> 1417.25
that I have plenty of material to engage

1412.51 --> 1421.66
in new flatter talk so we look forward

1417.25 --> 1424.84
to that so going to be about the at

1421.66 --> 1427.6000000000001
least the aberration of gravity and

1424.84 --> 1429.58
basically the aftermath of it all I've

1427.6 --> 1432.6599999999999
already explained so many times but I'll

1429.58 --> 1436.8999999999999
just put it out there officially and

1432.66 --> 1438.94
then there is what creates lava it's an

1436.9 --> 1442.63
interesting subject hopefully with the

1438.94 --> 1446.3400000000001
guests we can talk about it and it was

1442.63 --> 1446.3400000000001
another thing again

1452.97 --> 1460.38
anyway these two things could at least

1456.97 --> 1464.17
make one hangout for sure and who knows

1460.38 --> 1466.0900000000001
what else I'll come up with in the

1464.17 --> 1469.8100000000002
meantime I'm not gonna planning to do it

1466.09 --> 1471.9399999999998
like tomorrow maybe next week maybe two

1469.81 --> 1475.72
weeks I'm not in a hurry

1471.94 --> 1481.81
it seems that I could get more

1475.72 --> 1483.1000000000001
inspiration more and yes feelings of

1481.81 --> 1486.01
insurance about it

1483.1 --> 1489.31
to be certain yeah be more certain about

1486.01 --> 1492.01
my case I'm pretty sure about about the

1489.31 --> 1495.1299999999999
gravity part laughs I still has some

1492.01 --> 1497.17
questioning researching to do anyway

1495.13 --> 1500.91
there will be more flat earth talks in

1497.17 --> 1500.91
the future that is for sure

1512.92 --> 1520.98
okay I am at a blank for a moment and

1517.45 --> 1520.98
I'm gonna get some TLB

1585.57 --> 1595.6799999999998
right peanuts god yes Allenby wants to

1590.95 --> 1608.26
join our cult right which one is that

1595.68 --> 1612.94
hilarious right anyway

1608.26 --> 1617.95
yeah about real occult secrets you know

1612.94 --> 1623.0800000000002
the funny thing about them is if you're

1617.95 --> 1626.68
not ready to deal with the true insight

1623.08 --> 1629.8899999999999
of real call things you will simply not

1626.68 --> 1636.8200000000002
understand them properly that's the

1629.89 --> 1643.42
funny thing about it it's you require a

1636.82 --> 1649.3
certain insight and clarity level to be

1643.42 --> 1652.24
able to transfer your assumption base as

1649.3 --> 1655.45
it is structured and completely over

1652.24 --> 1659.41
allow it to be overhauled into a new

1655.45 --> 1663.07
structure that will be required to truly

1659.41 --> 1667.21
understand the totality of the occult

1663.07 --> 1669.9399999999998
principles and if you don't have that

1667.21 --> 1674.92
strength of mind down not that

1669.94 --> 1678.97
flexibility or not just the care passion

1674.92 --> 1681.22
or depth need of insight you're just

1678.97 --> 1686.23
gonna overlook it and you're going to

1681.22 --> 1689.77
interpret another more base layer of

1686.23 --> 1694.98
that occult concept so good luck to you

1689.77 --> 1696.8799999999999
the funny why do you think that we

1694.98 --> 1700.51
normal people and flat-earthers

1696.88 --> 1705.75
especially can detect so many occult

1700.51 --> 1710.41
things being injected in so many

1705.75 --> 1712.66
day-to-day things do you think you truly

1710.41 --> 1715.0900000000001
understand to come the total depth of

1712.66 --> 1720.43
that while other people don't even see

1715.09 --> 1723.04
it so yeah if you really really know you

1720.43 --> 1726.16
really have the power then you'll truly

1723.04 --> 1730.36
understand the things and you'll also be

1726.16 --> 1733.48
more inclined to keep the true depth of

1730.36 --> 1735.58
the knowledge to yourself because one of

1733.48 --> 1737.5
the first things you find out similar to

1735.58 --> 1741.1
flat earth is that other people can't

1737.5 --> 1754.24
handle it if you explain the true depth

1741.1 --> 1757.78
of it so it's what I've experienced yeah

1754.24 --> 1762.88
I said aberration three times including

1757.78 --> 1768.25
this time today like I say it all the

1762.88 --> 1771.16
time I said it a lot yesterday though

1768.25 --> 1776.29
but that was purely because Riley was

1771.16 --> 1779.6200000000001
being Marking dog again like usual so

1776.29 --> 1787.8999999999999
then I have to bark back show them that

1779.62 --> 1790.2099999999998
I I will pickin bark back you know and

1787.9 --> 1792.94
if he barks at me basically trying to

1790.21 --> 1796.03
make me swallow words and not use them

1792.94 --> 1799.48
again then I will bark with those words

1796.03 --> 1801.91
right back because it's my freakin right

1799.48 --> 1807.51
to use those words and not be harassed

1801.91 --> 1807.51
over them so yeah that's what I do

1810.3 --> 1813.3
Cheers

1826.62 --> 1834.9299999999998
there's a lot of people in chat that are

1829.18 --> 1834.93
saying really silly things anyway

1835.22 --> 1838.42
[Music]

1843.84 --> 1852.149
yeah someone should talk about I've been

1848.599 --> 1856.529
going through my dark world experiences

1852.149 --> 1858.7489999999998
a lot like also from a wider angle

1856.529 --> 1862.969
because each experience is very

1858.749 --> 1865.769
elaborate and very impressive to me as

1862.969 --> 1870.1190000000001
how I experienced it especially in the

1865.769 --> 1871.83
time frame that I experienced it but the

1870.119 --> 1875.1589999999999
more I go through it I guess it's very

1871.83 --> 1877.799
similar to knowledge in physics and

1875.159 --> 1881.19
everything the more I start to just be

1877.799 --> 1885.899
able to zoom out and see the entire

1881.19 --> 1889.529
picture of it and yeah

1885.899 --> 1892.7389999999998
that allows me to see other structures

1889.529 --> 1897.809
and patterns within the whole it's just

1892.739 --> 1900.529
fascinating like in my experience and

1897.809 --> 1904.95
even partially waking experience that

1900.529 --> 1908.909
very religious seeming icons would

1904.95 --> 1913.559
approach me like in real life I had this

1908.909 --> 1916.499
amazing it in waking life when I could I

1913.559 --> 1919.289
have closed my eyes and I had seen like

1916.499 --> 1922.049
a field of light and Buddha would almost

1919.289 --> 1924.57
like out of the milk seemed almost like

1922.049 --> 1927.539
a milk of energy just rise out of it and

1924.57 --> 1929.729
face to face approach me like it like a

1927.539 --> 1933.899
crystal statue or something and that was

1929.729 --> 1936.779
an amazing experience and didn't talk or

1933.899 --> 1939.9289999999999
anything I didn't feel like almost

1936.779 --> 1942.839
didn't it was just very mystical didn't

1939.929 --> 1945.269
feel like a regular human type entity

1942.839 --> 1948.149
couldn't really detect ego or anything

1945.269 --> 1951.539
what's fascinating anyway and in my

1948.149 --> 1959.129
vision thing in the entire thing I also

1951.539 --> 1963.859
had seen entities that really reminded

1959.129 --> 1970.2289999999998
me for example of the Hindu Pantheon and

1963.859 --> 1973.46
and others other like the Nordic

1970.229 --> 1976.16
Pantheon is freaking seen it's just I

1973.46 --> 1979.8500000000001
just couldn't

1976.16 --> 1986.71
I it wasn't what I expected let's just

1979.85 --> 1989.35
say it like that and yeah what do I

1986.71 --> 1991.73
conclude from these experiences

1989.35 --> 1996.6999999999998
especially considering the dark world

1991.73 --> 2001.15
but they did have like rules things that

1996.7 --> 2005.8600000000001
they wanted in trade for potential

2001.15 --> 2009.8500000000001
protection I guess and it was very funny

2005.86 --> 2012.82
and how that worked and I seem to have

2009.85 --> 2016.75
been patching up things I guess with the

2012.82 --> 2019.36
Hindu gods over time especially since I

2016.75 --> 2022.9
know I'm a vegetarian and they

2019.36 --> 2025.0
appreciate that and that's just it's not

2022.9 --> 2029.5800000000002
like oh my god I'm gonna be a Hindu now

2025.0 --> 2032.7
no I am still a personal principled

2029.58 --> 2036.6399999999999
follower of the past path of Christ

2032.7 --> 2040.06
which is a personal religion and that is

2036.64 --> 2045.76
the way I deal with the world and with

2040.06 --> 2049.72
spiritual matters but I do recognize

2045.76 --> 2053.77
that there is something to the Hindu

2049.72 --> 2055.81
religion and yeah to the spirits over

2053.77 --> 2057.52
there there is something to that there's

2055.81 --> 2061.15
something about that and I'm very

2057.52 --> 2064.84
fascinated with and there are others the

2061.15 --> 2067.06
other Pantheon's but what is that are

2064.84 --> 2071.56
they the same creatures but from a

2067.06 --> 2078.57
different perspective or are they really

2071.56 --> 2081.52
separate Pantheon's or is it just all a

2078.57 --> 2085.6600000000003
reflection of my imagination of what

2081.52 --> 2088.5099999999998
they could be like who knows but it was

2085.66 --> 2093.5499999999997
all of fascinating experience to say the

2088.51 --> 2096.9700000000003
least and still yeah it makes me not

2093.55 --> 2099.52
want to exclude anything basically it's

2096.97 --> 2102.1899999999996
just more to research more to experience

2099.52 --> 2107.05
about it and as long as I just don't

2102.19 --> 2109.51
make any means I guess especially not

2107.05 --> 2110.1090000000004
for the wrong reasons because you can

2109.51 --> 2113.73
oppose

2110.109 --> 2117.609
principles of certain deities I guess

2113.73 --> 2121.15
but not like curse at them or whatever

2117.609 --> 2123.0989999999997
for it but just oppose them in that

2121.15 --> 2128.4990000000003
principle and try to respect them in

2123.099 --> 2130.96
others and that does work at least up to

2128.499 --> 2133.3289999999997
a certain degree I don't know what will

2130.96 --> 2138.009
happen in extreme circumstances if that

2133.329 --> 2141.3390000000004
will actually be a problem considering

2138.009 --> 2144.099
that we'll see it's so fake ethereal

2141.339 --> 2147.97
stuff I guess this is probably not what

2144.099 --> 2150.599
you guys are waiting for and expect

2147.97 --> 2157.45
silly troll videos about parts of this

2150.599 --> 2160.089
early bird I guess but yeah this stuff

2157.45 --> 2162.3689999999997
is also my mind you know I'm I deal with

2160.089 --> 2164.999
the physical but I also absolutely deal

2162.369 --> 2169.9
with ethereal things

2164.999 --> 2171.999
my original quests how I came into the

2169.9 --> 2174.88
understanding of the pattern and this is

2171.999 --> 2183.299
like team stuff late-teen so whenever

2174.88 --> 2188.619
between my 15 and 21 I was obsessed with

2183.299 --> 2192.849
basically merging science with the

2188.619 --> 2196.239
spiritual and I wanted to basically try

2192.849 --> 2198.489
to scientifically get accepted and prove

2196.239 --> 2201.43
ethereal things that prove the spirit

2198.489 --> 2208.69
prove the consciousness prove ghosts

2201.43 --> 2214.93
like somehow get these things accepted

2208.69 --> 2217.48
and even just we say analyzed and well

2214.93 --> 2219.819
many of these things are happening now

2217.48 --> 2222.88
and it's still bit poopoo here and there

2219.819 --> 2225.279
but there is so much research on

2222.88 --> 2227.4990000000003
reincarnation that the memories for

2225.279 --> 2230.14
example and near-death experience there

2227.499 --> 2231.9399999999996
is so much happening out there so it

2230.14 --> 2236.3489999999997
kind of is happening what I had hoped

2231.94 --> 2240.19
for but yet it's still in its baby shoes

2236.349 --> 2243.54
and yeah we

2240.19 --> 2246.9900000000002
can say yet where it will be going

2243.54 --> 2248.23
considering the political circumstances

2246.99 --> 2251.3799999999997
yeah

2248.23 --> 2254.56
will they continue to allow it or will

2251.38 --> 2256.569
they suddenly just cut it off and just

2254.56 --> 2260.13
declare everything liberal or whatever I

2256.569 --> 2260.13
don't know what's gonna happen with that

2260.4 --> 2271.81
but yeah I'm very happy that that the

2268.81 --> 2274.569
spiritual has been more culturally open

2271.81 --> 2277.98
up unfortunately that also brings up a

2274.569 --> 2282.15
lot of wishy-washy fake people and

2277.98 --> 2285.73
really sorry to say dumb New Agers

2282.15 --> 2290.52
really freaking down but yeah you know

2285.73 --> 2293.23
with every opening up of things

2290.52 --> 2294.94
information always new type of stupid

2293.23 --> 2297.339
people arrived just like the trolls

2294.94 --> 2300.369
arrived with the opening of social media

2297.339 --> 2302.98
so yeah that's what's gonna happen

2300.369 --> 2304.329
anyway but it's still great because

2302.98 --> 2307.569
there's a lot of people out there that

2304.329 --> 2310.8
can now talk about these things and you

2307.569 --> 2314.109
can have really interesting valuable

2310.8 --> 2320.5
wisdom generating conversations with

2314.109 --> 2323.68
that so I love how conversation culture

2320.5 --> 2325.96
has changed in that regard anyway it's

2323.68 --> 2327.5499999999997
almost three o'clock now and the flat

2325.96 --> 2330.839
plates have probably already started up

2327.55 --> 2332.7400000000002
I'm gonna round out this I guess

2330.839 --> 2335.56
one-man-show

2332.74 --> 2338.9799999999996
flattered at the earlybird nine I was

2335.56 --> 2341.5
late and I have any guess but yeah I

2338.98 --> 2345.06
talked about a lot of stuff and dug into

2341.5 --> 2347.53
a lot of stuff so I hope you enjoyed it

2345.06 --> 2351.0099999999998
