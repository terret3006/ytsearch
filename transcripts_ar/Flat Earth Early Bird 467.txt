getting and yeah well throughout the

87.03 --> 94.5
show so today the weather it's seriously

91.86 --> 97.32
just look at every single day before

94.5 --> 100.11
this like every time it is just it just

97.32 --> 102.69
switches around switches around switches

100.11 --> 107.84
around switches around switches around

102.69 --> 107.84
there's the moon it's over there

117.08 --> 123.97
[Music]

119.67 --> 126.43
look at that it's half way lit even

123.97 --> 129.33
though I know otherwise if you presume

126.43 --> 134.14000000000001
if you presume the earth to be a globe

129.33 --> 140.92000000000002
well why is it like 20 degrees away and

134.14 --> 142.83999999999997
yet half lit mmm-hmm yeah sorry I'm not

140.92 --> 144.51999999999998
gonna get over that I don't care if

142.84 --> 147.19
supposedly the mechanics have been

144.52 --> 151.03
paired it makes no logical sense

147.19 --> 154.62
whatsoever to me anyway the sky is clear

151.03 --> 157.87
and as you saw let me look again it's

154.62 --> 160.59
beautiful clouds I really think it's an

157.87 --> 160.59
amazing sight

166.19 --> 169.6
is that just amazing

174.78 --> 186.93
all right anyway yeah so yeah and

184.26 --> 189.41
surprisingly I feel a lot better today

186.93 --> 193.23000000000002
than I did yesterday

189.41 --> 195.18
so although I'm still very restless very

193.23 --> 198.209
very restless not as bad as yesterday

195.18 --> 201.36
though I also had got dinner because

198.209 --> 203.4
yeah the day before yesterday I said I

201.36 --> 208.29000000000002
basically haven't eaten anything and

203.4 --> 211.59
that did not drop well in the night well

208.29 --> 216.29999999999998
this night did get plenty of sheep a

211.59 --> 220.2
cheap sleep I counted plenty of sheep

216.3 --> 223.32000000000002
and yeah no chemtrails either indeed

220.2 --> 225.17999999999998
yeah that I hadn't even noticed that but

223.32 --> 228.09
that's true I have not seen this thing

225.18 --> 230.58
okay I'm sure as of yet don't know how

228.09 --> 235.20000000000002
long that will last but and for now we

230.58 --> 239.19
can enjoy that and but yeah I had a good

235.2 --> 241.5
dinner with a chicken wing it's like

239.19 --> 243.18
yeah I don't know I've been heading her

241.5 --> 245.4
calling like you need chicken and

243.18 --> 248.549
everytime I smelled like roasted chicken

245.4 --> 250.62
I'd go half nuts like a dog so I thought

248.549 --> 257.36
okay I guess I need to eat chicken and I

250.62 --> 257.36
did yesterday and it was great great hmm

258.709 --> 264.05
together with some broccoli and french

261.03 --> 267.419
fries and yeah it was awesome anyway

264.05 --> 272.55
good night's sleep didn't did go to bed

267.419 --> 277.04999999999995
pretty late watching the rest of the

272.55 --> 279.90000000000003
Matrix triology tri ology didn't finish

277.05 --> 285.09000000000003
up the third movie entirely yet and I'm

279.9 --> 289.09999999999997
just again so shocked to see so many

285.09 --> 291.27
things in there that I've basically

289.1 --> 293.79
overlooked with my consciousness when I

291.27 --> 296.84999999999997
saw the first time yeah you know why

293.79 --> 300.8
that probably also is true I'm even kind

296.85 --> 305.93
of afraid to proceed watching because

300.8 --> 309.229
when the matrix 3 came out

305.93 --> 315.8
and I watched it in I watch it in

309.229 --> 319.96999999999997
theatres with friends and well exactly

315.8 --> 322.31
while I was watching it I it impressed

319.97 --> 326.33000000000004
me and horrified me and shocked me so

322.31 --> 328.43
much because I was already on a path of

326.33 --> 333.979
getting lost in delusion

328.43 --> 337.789
I had no base I was basically kind of

333.979 --> 341.06
lost as described and as I watched the

337.789 --> 345.02
third movie right afterward I stumbled

341.06 --> 348.28000000000003
into a very deep psychotic backlash very

345.02 --> 351.94899999999996
deep very painful very dark world

348.28 --> 355.15999999999997
hallucination revealing even life as I

351.949 --> 359.0
was talking with people it was

355.16 --> 363.08000000000004
terrifying and in retrospect I think

359.0 --> 366.979
that the movie just or as I felt that

363.08 --> 370.46
the devil punished me for looking too

366.979 --> 372.889
close to the truth that's that's like

370.46 --> 376.63899999999995
the mystical way I interpreted it back

372.889 --> 378.53000000000003
then and yeah it's all about the

376.639 --> 380.18
consciousness and about ascending

378.53 --> 383.419
consciousness that's really what the

380.18 --> 386.78000000000003
matrix is all about and it has been more

383.419 --> 393.909
about that than I ever even realized and

386.78 --> 400.4
it's done so well it's done so well and

393.909 --> 402.229
they they pull out every level of where

400.4 --> 403.88
people can get stuck and how they

402.229 --> 407.349
respond where they get stuck how they

403.88 --> 410.96
respond every level all of those

407.349 --> 416.09
struggles are in the movie every single

410.96 --> 419.69
level it is fascinating to no end just

416.09 --> 427.07
pay close attention it's incredible

419.69 --> 427.61
anyway so yeah that was impressive what

427.07 --> 431.69
else

427.61 --> 433.51
Owen Benjamin oh my god yesterday that

431.69 --> 437.92
was quite shocking

433.51 --> 444.01
because I can't perfectly

437.92 --> 448.12
explain it but that video that that he

444.01 --> 453.81
showed from what is it ninety sixty nine

448.12 --> 457.33
I think it was like a very sixties

453.81 --> 460.15
business style two people basically

457.33 --> 463.27
talking and it was about secret business

460.15 --> 466.26
and and how they planned ahead and they

463.27 --> 472.40999999999997
literally in that video that literally

466.26 --> 475.27
literally came out in 1969 on television

472.41 --> 481.14000000000004
television right it's not some secret

475.27 --> 486.03999999999996
video it says everything everything

481.14 --> 490.16999999999996
space fake space rockets fake satellites

486.04 --> 496.95000000000005
fake nukes fake media fake news

490.17 --> 501.21000000000004
literally using the words fake news okay

496.95 --> 505.15
it was so staggering and the thing is I

501.21 --> 509.19
remember seeing it before a long long

505.15 --> 513.669
time ago and I cannot I cannot trace I

509.19 --> 517.72
cannot trace whether I've seen it on an

513.669 --> 521.59
actual physical television at the time

517.72 --> 523.84
or if it was a dark world experience it

521.59 --> 527.11
could be just in that category as when I

523.84 --> 532.0600000000001
presumed to have seen an iPhone with

527.11 --> 534.1
YouTube videos on it in 1997 so it may

532.06 --> 536.1999999999999
be that I've seen it through that and

534.1 --> 540.64
even as I went through it B which I

536.2 --> 542.44
remember I rejected it I rejected it I

540.64 --> 547.78
thought this is ridiculous what is your

542.44 --> 551.5400000000001
point really that's the first time that

547.78 --> 554.269
I remember seeing it so yeah

551.54 --> 556.37
because of this entanglement that I'm

554.269 --> 560.2090000000001
catching myself in as these things are

556.37 --> 565.16
being revealed I'm also having more

560.209 --> 570.68
trouble keeping myself together so I end

565.16 --> 574.009
up basically yelling a lot making me

570.68 --> 577.0889999999999
look like a total nutcase but I can

574.009 --> 581.6
explain every single thing as to why

577.089 --> 584.149
most people but no one is gonna ask so

581.6 --> 586.5500000000001
I'm just gonna be that guy doing what I

584.149 --> 592.009
do and just trying to handle this

586.55 --> 594.079
massive freakin information that seems

592.009 --> 600.009
like too much for a human being to bear

594.079 --> 600.0089999999999
really probably is leave it up to God

600.25 --> 609.68
anyway right Rena one rockhound

607.31 --> 614.81
well I don't know about that specific

609.68 --> 617.42
video I haven't found it on YouTube like

614.81 --> 619.0999999999999
a neurone Benjamin did not literally

617.42 --> 622.55
reveal the source where you can find it

619.1 --> 625.279
it might be out there but I don't know

622.55 --> 629.93
if this video was kind of

625.279 --> 632.36
compartmentalize in a way that they put

629.93 --> 634.79
it out in a timeslot when literally

632.36 --> 638.0
nobody in the world was watching they

634.79 --> 641.329
could have like put it on in the finals

638.0 --> 643.19
of some really important world football

641.329 --> 645.3499999999999
game or something think in that

643.19 --> 647.6
direction they put it on right when it's

645.35 --> 649.639
then nobody's gonna watch that boring

647.6 --> 652.0400000000001
[ __ ] with you business guys talking know

649.639 --> 653.42
everybody's gonna watch the football so

652.04 --> 657.11
they could have done it like that and

653.42 --> 658.91
that way slip it past every single

657.11 --> 661.16
person in the world except for those

658.91 --> 665.12
that really do know and are keeping it

661.16 --> 670.939
secret or keeping it secret keeping it

665.12 --> 672.43
safe the news vendors is that what that

670.939 --> 675.53
is

672.43 --> 675.53
[Music]

676.45 --> 682.21
okay interesting I'd like to see the

679.43 --> 682.2099999999999
original of that

693.24 --> 697.47
yelling shot what

698.19 --> 706.5600000000001
what are you talking about yelling [ __ ]

703.83 --> 709.0500000000001
at people no I yell I don't yell at any

706.56 --> 711.9
person I'm not gonna yell against a

709.05 --> 716.79
person that's ridiculous

711.9 --> 720.27
no I only Yahoo and then I I'm pretty

716.79 --> 724.56
certain that nobody will be hearing it

720.27 --> 726.36
or at least not be able to draw their

724.56 --> 728.4
attention directly to it as it

726.36 --> 731.5500000000001
transpired maybe somebody hears and in

728.4 --> 734.8199999999999
the distance oh not me okay

731.55 --> 738.54
sorry yeah I always think everything is

734.82 --> 742.5200000000001
about me that's also a problem and I'm

738.54 --> 742.52
not that important and I need to stop

743.72 --> 751.71
comparing my world model to myself

747.71 --> 754.6800000000001
because I am basically might be a smart

751.71 --> 757.77
guy but I'm also kind of pathetic in my

754.68 --> 760.8299999999999
own way and I'm really really not that

757.77 --> 764.1899999999999
special in the face of a lot of it and I

760.83 --> 766.6800000000001
really want to keep my mind in the

764.19 --> 772.97
realization of that and that is also why

766.68 --> 776.66
just I don't like power I really don't

772.97 --> 783.2
need it some to some degree you know

776.66 --> 785.67
it's an inevitable just nobody cares

783.2 --> 788.9300000000001
jaren what are you talking about Darren

785.67 --> 792.29
Darren played the video which video the

788.93 --> 792.29
which video

796.04 --> 801.65
Nathan Thompson yeah Nathan Thompson is

800.12 --> 806.09
kind of a loudmouth

801.65 --> 808.91
at it he doesn't give a [ __ ] then again

806.09 --> 811.25
he is freaking strong so it might just

808.91 --> 813.5
be all that testosterone that just says

811.25 --> 819.08
now you can yell at them and if they try

813.5 --> 823.28
to attack you just crush them that's not

819.08 --> 827.39
really me anyway not that I'm saying

823.28 --> 830.6899999999999
that he has evil in his heart or well

827.39 --> 833.0
everybody has some but he is it under

830.69 --> 835.4300000000001
control he is a legend absolutely and

833.0 --> 837.29
he's extremely smart and therefore you

835.43 --> 840.4699999999999
must also realize that he's burdened

837.29 --> 844.0
because intelligence really is a burden

840.47 --> 844.0
above all other things

845.41 --> 851.78
the myth that intelligence is some kind

849.62 --> 857.03
of blessed tool that makes everything

851.78 --> 859.8199999999999
easyy wrong it's wrong everything looks

857.03 --> 863.54
greener on the other side no the grass

859.82 --> 866.0600000000001
always does it's wrong but that does not

863.54 --> 869.63
mean that you should choose stupidity

866.06 --> 871.67
over a well-thought-out choice of course

869.63 --> 873.32
but that's just logic it hasn't it not

871.67 --> 882.17
even to do with intelligence rather

873.32 --> 885.13
wisdom he lets his dog crap on the

882.17 --> 885.13
sidewalk what

892.78 --> 895.53
cares

896.649 --> 906.439
what are you saying he should be

898.85 --> 909.589
arrested for jaywalking the [ __ ] low

906.439 --> 913.8689999999999
dank yeah I forgot to look through chat

909.589 --> 917.269
entirely I completely forgot completely

913.869 --> 919.7900000000001
let's try that may take a little longer

917.269 --> 922.339
though a gem seems to have been first

919.79 --> 929.689
been so abandoned Amanda young good

922.339 --> 932.4200000000001
surfing flat ball Tom Parker mother

929.689 --> 940.809
Salim and livable productions brand M

932.42 --> 944.209
it's you go Burma call Patricia Dockery

940.809 --> 946.699
Jeffry bill I might be I started

944.209 --> 952.2399999999999
probably starting to repeat some people

946.699 --> 952.24
now I'm a new young Iranian sense

955.36 --> 960.92
because I'm not Lee I'm literally not

957.829 --> 963.4699999999999
reading from the list of participants

960.92 --> 967.9989999999999
because that list to me has seemed to be

963.47 --> 970.879
extremely unreliable literally like more

967.999 --> 972.769
than 50% of most of the time so I'm just

970.879 --> 974.809
literally scrolling through the chat

972.769 --> 976.579
physically but therefore there's a lot

974.809 --> 977.059
of name repeats so if I repeat you time

976.579 --> 980.5999999999999
sorry

977.059 --> 988.759
and then again who cares um

980.6 --> 991.369
Rutland Barry yeah you don't have any

988.759 --> 994.299
demands you have not given me any money

991.369 --> 994.299
and so you're banned

999.3 --> 1009.319
I'm gonna different bill tired of Mack

1003.8 --> 1009.319
nine o'clock here oh okay

1023.28 --> 1030.3899999999999
yeah guys I need you to pay a little bit

1027.27 --> 1032.189
more attention to my chat because the

1030.39 --> 1033.66
troll sneaked in there again I didn't

1032.189 --> 1035.88
look through the chat or I would have

1033.66 --> 1040.74
kicked them out immediately but you

1035.88 --> 1043.3190000000002
gotta you have to I order you if you're

1040.74 --> 1045.24
a part of my chat you got to look at the

1043.319 --> 1047.76
people that are talking there because

1045.24 --> 1050.22

1247.32 --> 1257.52

1253.49 --> 1262.98
think he was like interviewed come on

1257.52 --> 1266.33
guys why he's like Mel Gibson that's

1262.98 --> 1269.28
right that's the guy what a legend and

1266.33 --> 1271.6499999999999
he was asked I think by some

1269.28 --> 1274.35
interviewers I don't know if it was CNN

1271.65 --> 1275.97
or whatever like yeah what are you gonna

1274.35 --> 1277.9499999999998
do we're gonna fold this are you gonna

1275.97 --> 1280.4
vote that and he basically said yeah I'm

1277.95 --> 1283.0800000000002
not gonna go with the false dichotomy

1280.4 --> 1287.49
I'm not gonna go this or that no I'm

1283.08 --> 1290.31
gonna go with God the way you did that

1287.49 --> 1291.36
that's exactly remember I don't know if

1290.31 --> 1294.44
he got it from me

1291.36 --> 1297.74
maybe it just came to him naturally

1294.44 --> 1302.79
maybe just got it

1297.74 --> 1306.39
remember Lucifer or Imam the middle path

1302.79 --> 1310.29
the way through I just felt this echo

1306.39 --> 1316.8300000000002
and almost was blown off my chair seeing

1310.29 --> 1319.07
that did anybody see that that was so

1316.83 --> 1319.07
good

1322.299 --> 1340.85
yeah and he asked these radiant eyes now

1331.82 --> 1345.4399999999998
it's really incredible he's an Aussie

1340.85 --> 1347.6
yeah I think yeah right he is Australian

1345.44 --> 1351.46
right or he used to be I don't know I

1347.6 --> 1351.4599999999998
think he's in America now I'm not sure

1361.179 --> 1368.169
but he does still have traces of

1363.45 --> 1375.219
Australian like through his his way of

1368.169 --> 1377.7990000000002
talking alil yeah that's right Marceline

1375.219 --> 1383.159
yeah yeah but he was like one of the

1377.799 --> 1387.149
first ones that actually tried to

1383.159 --> 1389.8300000000002
criticize Jews like really early

1387.149 --> 1392.4599999999998
really really really oh and everybody

1389.83 --> 1397.029
was like dude what the [ __ ] is he doing

1392.46 --> 1399.789
but but what about my what about my

1397.029 --> 1403.389
math.max movie don't ruin my Mad Max

1399.789 --> 1405.789
movie Mel Gibson you racist

1403.389 --> 1409.089
that was even my response in a way

1405.789 --> 1411.809
because I didn't get it he didn't but

1409.089 --> 1414.969
he'd never even expressed like hatred

1411.809 --> 1418.6589999999999
like that he was just like this is just

1414.969 --> 1421.989
wrong it's just wrong I need to speak

1418.659 --> 1425.0490000000002
out and control about the control about

1421.989 --> 1428.499
the manipulation he was there so so

1425.049 --> 1433.809
quick nobody was ready nobody in the

1428.499 --> 1436.109
world he's a legend he was there very

1433.809 --> 1436.109
quick

1442.619 --> 1445.619
right

1448.22 --> 1455.539
and yeah I know that's like the integers

1451.7 --> 1457.97
good use dude use they don't like it

1455.539 --> 1460.8799999999999
they don't like it when people openly

1457.97 --> 1463.34
criticize them even though there may be

1460.88 --> 1466.8090000000002
right and they might probably when

1463.34 --> 1469.37
really pressed can you say yeah don't

1466.809 --> 1474.8899999999999
like saying it but he's actually kind of

1469.37 --> 1477.1689999999999
right but yeah that's what it's all

1474.89 --> 1480.38
about really how are you going to

1477.169 --> 1483.289
criticize them are you gonna compare

1480.38 --> 1485.5100000000002
them to the devil to trash to something

1483.289 --> 1488.27
that needs to be gotten out of the word

1485.51 --> 1494.15
or are you just gonna say no they're

1488.27 --> 1500.9
just here to test us God has allowed

1494.15 --> 1505.22
them to exist just to test us and it's

1500.9 --> 1507.98
it seems to have a purpose and if that

1505.22 --> 1514.88
purpose would be lost they would be lost

1507.98 --> 1518.27
too and so may we and that's really the

1514.88 --> 1521.69
part of the Ascension it is not figure

1518.27 --> 1525.02
out to control the conflict the ruler

1521.69 --> 1528.38
the rebellion know figure out that they

1525.02 --> 1530.6589999999999
all are really in the want of the same

1528.38 --> 1533.0590000000002
thing in different positions from

1530.659 --> 1536.6000000000001
different angles and find that middle

1533.059 --> 1540.4089999999999
way through that nobody saw because they

1536.6 --> 1543.4089999999999
were all distracted by the earthly by

1540.409 --> 1545.45
the ego by their own personal wealth by

1543.409 --> 1549.7700000000002
their own personal gain they could get

1545.45 --> 1552.6100000000001
all that that's the biggest trick of

1549.77 --> 1552.61
Ascension

1557.549 --> 1565.0
yeah I got Tamera coffee by the way

1560.049 --> 1570.12
extra thought I could handle it today

1565.0 --> 1572.62
because I do feel a lot better and I I

1570.12 --> 1575.8899999999999
don't know maybe it's because I spent a

1572.62 --> 1580.51
lot of time basically trying to exorcise

1575.89 --> 1583.0300000000002
the devil from me it's like get out of

1580.51 --> 1586.96
my head get out of my heart I don't want

1583.03 --> 1590.29
to think about things that literally me

1586.96 --> 1593.1100000000001
as a person I can never influence I can

1590.29 --> 1597.79
never bear the responsibility because I

1593.11 --> 1600.49
am just a man and I need to stop letting

1597.79 --> 1603.1299999999999
do the whole let's just call him that

1600.49 --> 1607.48
convinced me that I should do that

1603.13 --> 1610.929
because it only gets in the way of my

1607.48 --> 1615.03
life and if I get in the way of my life

1610.929 --> 1619.69
then I get in the way of my life helping

1615.03 --> 1625.21
the rest of the world and that was kind

1619.69 --> 1627.1000000000001
of complex realization and again it's

1625.21 --> 1629.14
not the first time because this this

1627.1 --> 1631.51
type of puzzle that I have to deal with

1629.14 --> 1633.429
personally in these situations in these

1631.51 --> 1636.24
moments because it's not constant thank

1633.429 --> 1640.48
God it's not constant ooh

1636.24 --> 1644.23
shudder to think about that but every

1640.48 --> 1647.14
time I have to figure it out from

1644.23 --> 1649.72
scratch every time it's like black and

1647.14 --> 1652.24
white stripes and every time I get stuck

1649.72 --> 1654.88
on the single black or white stripe and

1652.24 --> 1658.419
I forget wait it's all black and white

1654.88 --> 1662.5900000000001
stripes all of it and I forget every

1658.419 --> 1666.94
single time I come below into this place

1662.59 --> 1669.1599999999999
again as I said when I basically and a

1666.94 --> 1672.3400000000001
lot of energy I have a lot of sight and

1669.16 --> 1675.429
then I see too far I see things that I

1672.34 --> 1677.47
cannot handle and then I tumble down and

1675.429 --> 1680.669
then I have to build up again and and

1677.47 --> 1684.929
basically real reconstruct myself

1680.669 --> 1688.179
reconstruct my own purpose of existence

1684.929 --> 1689.0800000000002
see what my place really is where my

1688.179 --> 1692.68
actual

1689.08 --> 1696.07
consciousness can rest safely without

1692.68 --> 1699.46
being torn apart I know maybe this

1696.07 --> 1700.71
sounds insanely complex or just insane I

1699.46 --> 1707.74
don't know man

1700.71 --> 1710.32
I'll drop it now right

1707.74 --> 1713.53
yeah Ober McCool Robert De Niro's movie

1710.32 --> 1717.27
vexed it was pretty good up until he

1713.53 --> 1721.36
went all anti-trump cry-baby

1717.27 --> 1722.02
because that was just so annoying so

1721.36 --> 1725.32
annoying

1722.02 --> 1729.57
this is but yeah he did make those

1725.32 --> 1729.57
movies waxed very good

1751.33 --> 1761.3
[Music]

1752.67 --> 1761.3000000000002
I don't know bandsaw bandit I don't know

1765.14 --> 1774.75
I've always and trust me I've had a good

1770.1 --> 1778.4099999999999
good look good good look it's well I

1774.75 --> 1783.29
kind of pride myself to be like a a gay

1778.41 --> 1788.64
master and I dabble in societal design

1783.29 --> 1792.53
so I'd have to say that a limited

1788.64 --> 1797.4
government is really kind of critical to

1792.53 --> 1800.19
keep things going to keep things from

1797.4 --> 1803.49
over polarizing up to the personal level

1800.19 --> 1805.73
and then destroying itself which is what

1803.49 --> 1809.67
the result of absolute Anarchy would be

1805.73 --> 1812.4
because anarchy is absolute freedom but

1809.67 --> 1816.54
also the absolute freedom to let the ego

1812.4 --> 1819.8100000000002
suddenly overtake you and become evil to

1816.54 --> 1822.6
ignore all other rights to just become a

1819.81 --> 1824.97
conqueror that is also the freedom that

1822.6 --> 1826.8
is gained with absolute energy it's a

1824.97 --> 1829.02
problem it's a big problem it's a

1826.8 --> 1835.76
natural problem and it's a problem that

1829.02 --> 1839.82
cannot be overcome cannot ever yeah

1835.76 --> 1842.4
night work for a while until it won't

1839.82 --> 1845.82
and then it's going to be big disaster

1842.4 --> 1849.42
one way or the other so I am still a

1845.82 --> 1852.54
proponent of very limited government

1849.42 --> 1856.17
that is basically like a controlled

1852.54 --> 1859.1399999999999
persistent corporation looked upon

1856.17 --> 1861.96
heavily with scrutiny from the whole

1859.14 --> 1866.19
public and it would be in the direction

1861.96 --> 1869.49
of libertarianism because a government

1866.19 --> 1872.55
really in the end is the only thing that

1869.49 --> 1874.49
keeps things rolling without every

1872.55 --> 1877.97
individual party including

1874.49 --> 1882.17
industrialists from just literally

1877.97 --> 1884.91
becoming monopoly men and just

1882.17 --> 1886.23
manipulating everything into their pure

1884.91 --> 1890.4
control

1886.23 --> 1892.98
a limited government can actually

1890.4 --> 1895.8300000000002
prevent that from happening the problem

1892.98 --> 1897.8700000000001
is however how government now exists

1895.83 --> 1899.07
especially in the United States it does

1897.87 --> 1903.1789999999999
quite the opposite

1899.07 --> 1905.49
now it actually actively feeds industry

1903.179 --> 1908.64
to become bigger to become more powerful

1905.49 --> 1911.63
to be able to compete but with the rest

1908.64 --> 1917.429
of the world industries but as it does

1911.63 --> 1919.6200000000001
it also feeds more power into those

1917.429 --> 1922.2
corporations themselves and what are

1919.62 --> 1925.32
they gonna do with that power we'll just

1922.2 --> 1928.679
look at some of the mega companies that

1925.32 --> 1933.809
have come out of the United States for

1928.679 --> 1935.69
example Google and now you understand

1933.809 --> 1939.6789999999999
what I mean

1935.69 --> 1943.95
the mechanism of how these things are

1939.679 --> 1948.24
dealt with in government has a great

1943.95 --> 1955.23
influence on how things will develop

1948.24 --> 1957.84
from that point on oh wow professor Phil

1955.23 --> 1960.8600000000001
Bell I'm getting all personal now am I

1957.84 --> 1960.86
happy with the Dutch government

1960.88 --> 1965.49
[Applause]

1962.3 --> 1973.6399999999999
that's a tough one I have three answers

1965.49 --> 1981.8
to that answer one yes answer to no

1973.64 --> 1981.8000000000002
answer three that's my answer

1992.32 --> 1998.049
so what part of the Dutch government am

1995.51 --> 2001.679
I kind of glad about am i happy about

1998.049 --> 2007.15
the grass roots government the people

2001.679 --> 2009.76
that are there really to help others to

2007.15 --> 2014.76
assist society to fulfill function to

2009.76 --> 2019.179
keep the public good healthy and growing

2014.76 --> 2022.54
and therefore also breed more taxpayers

2019.179 --> 2025.179
in order to feed their salary I think

2022.54 --> 2029.1299999999999
that a lot of Dutch people on this level

2025.179 --> 2033.22
are very good people very responsible

2029.13 --> 2035.41
now when it comes to the highest tier of

2033.22 --> 2037.47
the government that's where the

2035.41 --> 2041.41
Netherlands really is in trouble because

2037.47 --> 2044.5
we are a very little country and comes

2041.41 --> 2047.049
down to that even though we can manage

2044.5 --> 2052.149
our little country very efficiently we

2047.049 --> 2055.72
are basically delivered as just a minor

2052.149 --> 2058.8889999999997
pawn in the grand scheme of things so

2055.72 --> 2062.56
the we don't have any physical weight

2058.889 --> 2065.4700000000003
not really we just have our intellect or

2062.56 --> 2068.679
goodwill our cultural example of that

2065.47 --> 2073.5299999999997
that is the only thing that really keeps

2068.679 --> 2076.929
the Netherlands up and persistent and

2073.53 --> 2079.09
functional and at the same time this

2076.929 --> 2081.2200000000003
these very aspects of the Netherlands

2079.09 --> 2085.51
have been slowly degenerating and

2081.22 --> 2088.54
degrading through the media specifically

2085.51 --> 2092.5600000000004
media and political party influences

2088.54 --> 2097.69
that effect has degraded over the last

2092.56 --> 2100.6
thirty years to a level where soon the

2097.69 --> 2104.77
original spirit of the Netherlands may

2100.6 --> 2107.08
potentially be lost forever doesn't mean

2104.77 --> 2109.24
that there will no longer be any Dutch

2107.08 --> 2113.0499999999997
people that might carry on the flame

2109.24 --> 2114.99
inside but what the Netherlands was now

2113.05 --> 2117.88
what it is now is almost not even

2114.99 --> 2121.8999999999996
recognizable compared to say 50 years

2117.88 --> 2123.3900000000003
ago it's literally not recognizable but

2121.9 --> 2125.61
could get worse

2123.39 --> 2129.5099999999998
that's a big problem yeah and the

2125.61 --> 2132.42
banking system yeah but you the

2129.51 --> 2138.1400000000003
Netherlands almost literally invented

2132.42 --> 2142.53
banking okay it's kind of historically

2138.14 --> 2145.5899999999997
noted now how accurate is that I don't

2142.53 --> 2147.86
know but it is kind of like officially

2145.59 --> 2151.7400000000002
admitted that the Dutch invented banking

2147.86 --> 2158.33
and and that is also the way they kind

2151.74 --> 2162.72
of gotten into the world so right

2158.33 --> 2165.14
self-reliance and designers yeah there

2162.72 --> 2168.93
are certainly among the Dutch people

2165.14 --> 2171.48
that those are things that spawn from

2168.93 --> 2176.1299999999997
forth from our spirit but we are also

2171.48 --> 2179.61
more travel oriented more business

2176.13 --> 2182.4900000000002
oriented compared to for example the

2179.61 --> 2186.1800000000003
Germans because the Germans are also

2182.49 --> 2191.43
very well known to be great designers

2186.18 --> 2192.99
and being self-reliant being able to

2191.43 --> 2197.8199999999997
take care of themselves and each other

2192.99 --> 2200.66
and having very decent architecture very

2197.82 --> 2203.3700000000003
decent cars of course and all that

2200.66 --> 2204.87
industry they're very well known for

2203.37 --> 2208.83
that and there are a lot bigger country

2204.87 --> 2211.44
with a lot more people so that yeah we

2208.83 --> 2213.72
are neighbors literally Germany is

2211.44 --> 2215.85
literally right next to the Netherlands

2213.72 --> 2220.22
so it's not surprising that we share

2215.85 --> 2220.22
traits over history

2229.15 --> 2232.529
hey sir

2238.51 --> 2244.03
yeah that's right Mensa ban it it's it's

2241.99 --> 2245.7999999999997
been a primary strategy and I think that

2244.03 --> 2249.52
the Netherlands was probably one of the

2245.8 --> 2253.3
the best or the worst at applying it and

2249.52 --> 2256.33
that is they have a plan they want

2253.3 --> 2258.4300000000003
people to do something but if they tell

2256.33 --> 2262.359
the people outright the people would say

2258.43 --> 2265.77
screw you don't tell us what to do we

2262.359 --> 2269.71
are free we can do whatever we want

2265.77 --> 2275.25
right so what it does instead is give

2269.71 --> 2279.609
you another story and thereby gradually

2275.25 --> 2282.55
tricking you into wanting to do the

2279.609 --> 2285.67
thing that they want in the first place

2282.55 --> 2290.4
and you could almost say that the Dutch

2285.67 --> 2290.4
invented this little mind-control trick

2291.42 --> 2299.28
and I think that one of the people that

2295.72 --> 2303.16
probably the best or the worst at it is

2299.28 --> 2305.4100000000003
Prime Minister it's very much loathed

2303.16 --> 2308.47
for it now because yeah the more time

2305.41 --> 2310.96
passes the more it becomes obvious that

2308.47 --> 2312.43
every step of the way was a trick and

2310.96 --> 2316.69
guess what people don't like to be

2312.43 --> 2320.44
tricked and people are kind of sick of

2316.69 --> 2323.38
him now like for real and it should be

2320.44 --> 2326.89
because this country is on the verge of

2323.38 --> 2328.7200000000003
being wrecked and so are many other

2326.89 --> 2329.17
European countries and when I mean

2328.72 --> 2333.25
wrecked

2329.17 --> 2336.4900000000002
I mean wrecked by finance that are

2333.25 --> 2339.07
literally seemingly I don't know exactly

2336.49 --> 2342.25
but it just seems like it's top-down

2339.07 --> 2346.3
order like yeah it's been really nice

2342.25 --> 2349.359
but you are going to destroy your

2346.3 --> 2351.4500000000003
country now you're gonna tear it apart

2349.359 --> 2356.619
you're gonna wreck the culture

2351.45 --> 2359.56
completely and yeah you're gonna

2356.619 --> 2360.55
surrender you're gonna surrender to the

2359.56 --> 2365.859
overstates

2360.55 --> 2369.79
and there is no way we are allowing you

2365.859 --> 2372.19
to not do that so it is almost like a

2369.79 --> 2375.069
covert death struggle that seems

2372.19 --> 2379.69
have engaged years ago because that

2375.069 --> 2385.7799999999997
feeling has been slowly pressing people

2379.69 --> 2390.2200000000003
know it but it's still not overt though

2385.78 --> 2394.5690000000004
it's still a covert game in the

2390.22 --> 2398.6189999999997
subconscious most of it and it's not

2394.569 --> 2404.38
gonna last because the Netherlands the

2398.619 --> 2406.69
Dutch people meet including our spirit

2404.38 --> 2410.9500000000003
is a little bit too strong for that kind

2406.69 --> 2412.3
of weak mind control [ __ ] tactic on

2410.95 --> 2415.5989999999997
the long run

2412.3 --> 2419.9500000000003
yeah we can be tricked you can trick us

2415.599 --> 2425.319
forever and we may forgive but we will

2419.95 --> 2430.66
not forget I think that the Dutch are

2425.319 --> 2434.079
also renowned for their memories which I

2430.66 --> 2436.1189999999997
think on average are better than yeah we

2434.079 --> 2442.3590000000004
if things were better at right yeah yeah

2436.119 --> 2444.2200000000003
happens so the Netherlands is gonna try

2442.359 --> 2445.99
to break free at some point when just

2444.22 --> 2449.0789999999997
the government says you have to do this

2445.99 --> 2450.97
no or it's over and the people are gonna

2449.079 --> 2454.599
say yeah that's really nice that means

2450.97 --> 2456.91
it's over for you now you're the one

2454.599 --> 2459.4300000000003
that wants that deal you're the one that

2456.91 --> 2461.0499999999997
wants to pay out guess what you're gonna

2459.43 --> 2465.16
go to jail now you

2461.05 --> 2469.48
traight are that's right and we're gonna

2465.16 --> 2471.2799999999997
go there and we're gonna go not do that

2469.48 --> 2473.92
fricking thing we're gonna let it all

2471.28 --> 2476.65
collapse and then we're gonna reorient

2473.92 --> 2483.13
ourselves the new situation in the world

2476.65 --> 2485.4700000000003
which is probably gonna suck a lot it's

2483.13 --> 2487.78
probably not gonna be happy it's not

2485.47 --> 2491.5299999999997
gonna be a good time for for European

2487.78 --> 2495.55
countries in general and that situation

2491.53 --> 2498.27
is already kind of happening transpiring

2495.55 --> 2498.27
right now

2501.239 --> 2511.7490000000003
but yeah there is no other way the other

2506.769 --> 2514.749
choice is suicide and they don't tell

2511.749 --> 2521.049
you that that choice is suicide but it

2514.749 --> 2522.8799999999997
is yeah and I think a lot of people know

2521.049 --> 2527.829
that they are starting to figure that

2522.88 --> 2531.099
out they are not offering a solution

2527.829 --> 2537.329
they're offering suicide with a good

2531.099 --> 2537.329
story and needs to end

2553.82 --> 2562.07
banking started in Italy well maybe a

2558.0 --> 2565.97
banking guild really started in Italy

2562.07 --> 2568.5
but the concept of national banking

2565.97 --> 2572.31
maybe that is more what it's like look

2568.5 --> 2575.79
people have hoarded piles and piles of

2572.31 --> 2580.14
goes gold for all eternity and Kings

2575.79 --> 2583.17
used to do that and they would lend

2580.14 --> 2584.67
people resources to do things and if

2583.17 --> 2587.73
they didn't do it right they'd freaking

2584.67 --> 2591.119
kill them that's the original banking

2587.73 --> 2593.55
well the Netherlands when they went to

2591.119 --> 2598.1000000000004
kind of Republic model sort of half

2593.55 --> 2602.369
Republic half Kingdom thing they were

2598.1 --> 2607.17
kind of system systemizing the banking

2602.369 --> 2610.67
system allowing citizens to do that and

2607.17 --> 2614.25
that was kind of unique to lend

2610.67 --> 2617.13
responsibly and that was really a

2614.25 --> 2621.09
banking revolution that was beyond just

2617.13 --> 2623.73
a king or some mighty person sitting on

2621.09 --> 2624.9900000000002
a giant pile of gold like a dragon that

2623.73 --> 2627.03
was the big difference with the

2624.99 --> 2630.0899999999997
Netherlands Netherlands really figured

2627.03 --> 2634.02
out national banking it was great

2630.09 --> 2638.19
advantage it really helped us go around

2634.02 --> 2645.84
the world and make people envious of

2638.19 --> 2648.14
Dutch citizenship but that's a long time

2645.84 --> 2648.1400000000003
ago

2672.44 --> 2677.51
I don't know Fleur P Dara / I don't know

2675.26 --> 2680.8700000000003
if they were the original moneylenders

2677.51 --> 2684.0800000000004
all I know is that they perfected the

2680.87 --> 2686.96
art of money lending and gaining power

2684.08 --> 2689.15
from it that is what they did I don't

2686.96 --> 2693.44
think they invented money lending in

2689.15 --> 2695.51
banking I don't think so at all although

2693.44 --> 2699.14
they have might they might have been

2695.51 --> 2702.11
occupied doing this sort of thing since

2699.14 --> 2705.8799999999997
they first came into being that could be

2702.11 --> 2708.26
I don't think they invented it at all I

2705.88 --> 2711.55
don't really think they even invent

2708.26 --> 2715.2400000000002
things that much well maybe they do i

2711.55 --> 2715.2400000000002
I'm not touching that

2731.14 --> 2736.68
no I have not heard that song never

2734.14 --> 2741.6299999999997
heard of it never heard of the person

2736.68 --> 2741.6299999999997
late on stones no idea

2747.08 --> 2751.85
I don't know professor Phil I don't know

2749.81 --> 2756.67
if the Dutch work elated great explorers

2751.85 --> 2760.79
I know that we were kind of fearless and

2756.67 --> 2767.03
that we were very pragmatic when it

2760.79 --> 2771.14
comes to like mutually mutually

2767.03 --> 2773.1200000000003
beneficial business and relations coming

2771.14 --> 2774.44
from that business that is really the

2773.12 --> 2776.99
Dutch thing that's what they've always

2774.44 --> 2779.0
done and we and I am still personally

2776.99 --> 2781.3399999999997
somewhat proud of that even though it's

2779.0 --> 2785.51
not even it's not my life it's hundreds

2781.34 --> 2787.82
of years ago but that the Dutch for

2785.51 --> 2790.67
example were one of the few groups that

2787.82 --> 2794.6600000000003
actually managed to make deals with

2790.67 --> 2796.94
Japan in that time because everything

2794.66 --> 2802.19
else was just being hostile and the

2796.94 --> 2806.12
Dutch they just got it they just they

2802.19 --> 2808.64
just really got it they figured out much

2806.12 --> 2810.77
of the world and just how to go to get

2808.64 --> 2814.16
things done with other people's that

2810.77 --> 2815.78
they that are alien and that that's

2814.16 --> 2823.73
always something that I thought was

2815.78 --> 2827.8300000000004
amazing from the Dutch they did did we

2823.73 --> 2831.17
find Australia I did not know could be

2827.83 --> 2835.33
but I also know that yeah

2831.17 --> 2838.76
the Vikings basically explored and

2835.33 --> 2841.94
occupied a great deal of America at

2838.76 --> 2848.48
least the west coast North America long

2841.94 --> 2852.08
long long time ago so I don't know this

2848.48 --> 2854.45
whole idea of we found it first I think

2852.08 --> 2857.5099999999998
it's highly overblown really because

2854.45 --> 2859.52
before us another group found it and

2857.51 --> 2861.5800000000004
before them another group found it and

2859.52 --> 2865.85
before them another group found it so

2861.58 --> 2868.1
you see who found what first I don't

2865.85 --> 2870.29
think it really matters that much it's

2868.1 --> 2874.24
just what it matters is what what they

2870.29 --> 2874.24
do with it once they find it

2879.66 --> 2884.2599999999998
tiny Wamba when is that the Netherlands

2882.13 --> 2887.71
when is it Holland well technically the

2884.26 --> 2893.11
Netherlands are basically the United

2887.71 --> 2895.66
Provinces of Holland because our

2893.11 --> 2897.61
original Holland was you have North

2895.66 --> 2900.69
Holland South Holland those are like the

2897.61 --> 2905.71
original provinces that started it out

2900.69 --> 2909.37
we're also the Amsterdam is in it

2905.71 --> 2912.57
Rotterdam that hague is in it so the

2909.37 --> 2915.94
biggest core is basically Holland and

2912.57 --> 2917.98
the Netherlands is yeah the gathering of

2915.94 --> 2920.16
several provinces surrounding all that

2917.98 --> 2922.9
more to the east and in the south and

2920.16 --> 2924.85
that is the Netherlands so the

2922.9 --> 2928.1800000000003
Netherlands is almost like the united

2924.85 --> 2930.88
states of Holland in a way but it's not

2928.18 --> 2934.5099999999998
States they're provinces and looked at

2930.88 --> 2938.76
skills like the Netherlands is I don't

2934.51 --> 2938.76
know it was big as New York City so

2945.48 --> 2951.12
anyway thanks I'm gonna run out the show

2948.28 --> 2954.28
it was interesting lots of history talk

2951.12 --> 2956.44
if you like the show please don't forget

2954.28 --> 2958.27
to upload it and if you haven't already

2956.44 --> 2959.89
subscribe to my channel and hit the bell

2958.27 --> 2961.27
notification so you know when I'm going

2959.89 --> 2962.92
live which is normally 2:00 p.m.

2961.27 --> 2965.86
Amsterdam time every day

2962.92 --> 2968.4700000000003
please also do support me through paypal

2965.86 --> 2971.23
patreon my GoFundMe and super chat we

2968.47 --> 2979.72
much appreciate it Australia was called

2971.23 --> 2983.56
New Zealand really ok huh I know that

2979.72 --> 2987.5699999999997
New Zealand was basically called after

2983.56 --> 2992.16
our province Zealand which is the most

2987.57 --> 2992.1600000000003
southwest province in the Netherlands

2993.98 --> 2999.65
and I know that originally New York was

2997.19 --> 3004.2400000000002
called New Amsterdam until we sold it

2999.65 --> 3006.04
for scraps but yeah I don't think the

3004.24 --> 3008.2299999999996
Dutch were ever allowed in the bigger

3006.04 --> 3012.4
plan to be able to have their own

3008.23 --> 3017.7400000000002
city-states in the United States it was

3012.4 --> 3019.3
yeah the plan was just set and we had to

3017.74 --> 3022.0
sell it or they would probably have just

3019.3 --> 3024.73
taken it that's what I think that's my

3022.0 --> 3027.73
suspicion I have no proof of this but
