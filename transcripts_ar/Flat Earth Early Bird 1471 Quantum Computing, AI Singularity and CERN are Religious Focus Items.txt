99.9 --> 105.60000000000001
so please keep the support coming

102.72 --> 111.74
or I'm gonna get a drill all right

105.6 --> 111.74
anyway the weather today is [ __ ]

114.119 --> 118.259
slightly less gray than this webcam

116.7 --> 121.979
makes it look

118.259 --> 124.439
but still it's kind of Stormy it's been

121.979 --> 127.14
stormy all night

124.439 --> 131.119
a bit of rain here and there not

127.14 --> 131.119
continual rainbow but still

132.0 --> 135.98
nice weather it is not

137.22 --> 142.22
I'm kind of happy that I don't have to

138.9 --> 142.22
get out for groceries today

144.739 --> 147.86
all right

158.959 --> 163.2
so yeah

161.099 --> 166.379
hmm

163.2 --> 168.599
this webcam kind of sucks

166.379 --> 170.57999999999998
and I'm gonna return it

168.599 --> 174.11999999999998
because I don't know yeah I do I don't

170.58 --> 176.58
even know why I just went to get it I

174.12 --> 179.28
should have ordered it online

176.58 --> 181.56
because I did basically find the same

179.28 --> 183.98
type of webcam and it was cheaper than

181.56 --> 183.98
this one

184.739 --> 189.3
right so I'm gonna return this hope that

187.62 --> 191.94
all just works out

189.3 --> 193.08
and if everything is according to

191.94 --> 195.35999999999999
schedule

193.08 --> 198.12
my other webcam should be in the mail

195.36 --> 201.0
tomorrow or the day after

198.12 --> 202.98000000000002
and it'll be exactly like the other cam

201.0 --> 205.56
I suspect

202.98 --> 208.61999999999998
maybe better had higher resolution

205.56 --> 210.9
capabilities than this thing

208.62 --> 214.56
and it was cheaper

210.9 --> 216.9
and it had a rotatable platform to

214.56 --> 219.3
exactly like the the old model

216.9 --> 222.18
because now I have to freaking turn my

219.3 --> 224.9
monitor every time and it and it just I

222.18 --> 224.9
mean this cam

225.599 --> 232.5
this cam is probably originally like a

229.68 --> 235.62
surveillance system type cam

232.5 --> 237.72
I think that's what like the program

235.62 --> 240.12
that makes it focus and everything is

237.72 --> 241.56
built on to just get a sharp an image to

240.12 --> 244.5
identify

241.56 --> 246.239
I mean oh yeah that's the webcam I want

244.5 --> 250.319
no not really

246.239 --> 255.239
so it feels like this Logitech cam

250.319 --> 258.56
specific this type has just been built

255.239 --> 262.019
for security cams and they just like had

258.56 --> 263.88
spares and they just built it used those

262.019 --> 267.44
for these webcams or something that's

263.88 --> 267.44
what it feels like and it sucks

269.34 --> 275.21999999999997
right it sucks for my show

272.639 --> 278.3
I don't really like it like I don't like

275.22 --> 278.3
the way it makes me look

279.9 --> 285.9
right so but the problem should be

283.139 --> 288.62
solved shortly

285.9 --> 288.62
foreign

291.419 --> 294.419
anyway

295.979 --> 303.18
nobody in just yet it's Wednesday the

299.28 --> 308.9
4th of January 2023

303.18 --> 308.90000000000003
ah hey Linux see you first in chat

314.04 --> 318.84000000000003
do you use your GoPro

317.34 --> 322.79999999999995
huh

318.84 --> 325.21999999999997
okay or if that functions

322.8 --> 327.90000000000003
would be kind of hilarious to use my

325.22 --> 330.24
p900 as that but that thing's just way

327.9 --> 332.58
too heavy to put it on top of my monitor

330.24 --> 334.8
I would have to build like a special

332.58 --> 338.59999999999997
platform

334.8 --> 338.6
attached to the wall for that

342.66 --> 347.1
but yeah those typical grow Pros are

344.88 --> 349.08
kind of small so that yeah that could

347.1 --> 351.47900000000004
work why not

349.08 --> 354.5
all right

351.479 --> 354.5
but uh

355.32 --> 362.039
I'm just getting the old model webcam

358.979 --> 363.71999999999997
and it's gonna be cheaper tripod behind

362.039 --> 365.9
the monitor yeah there's no space for

363.72 --> 365.90000000000003
that

367.199 --> 371.0
no

368.28 --> 371.0
I couldn't fit

371.88 --> 378.12
and I don't really feel like putting my

374.759 --> 380.16
p900 here as a webcam that would be kind

378.12 --> 383.22
of ridiculous

380.16 --> 386.98
it's not optimal for

383.22 --> 389.03900000000004
short distance footage

386.98 --> 391.139
[Music]

389.039 --> 393.36
and besides like I would have like oh

391.139 --> 397.56
let me show you the weather then pick up

393.36 --> 400.58000000000004
the entire p900 and just no

397.56 --> 400.58
no thanks

400.68 --> 406.5
besides like even the live connector was

404.46 --> 410.35999999999996
not great I don't think I can like

406.5 --> 410.36
literally use it for live streams

410.88 --> 417.06
it I can transfer recorded data

414.84 --> 420.17999999999995
but I don't even think you can have it

417.06 --> 425.759
on on camera mode while transferring

420.18 --> 425.759
those files so no just no anyway

428.28 --> 432.05999999999995
right

429.8 --> 434.36
anyway things are going to work out just

432.06 --> 434.36
fine

435.72 --> 439.319
but again

437.819 --> 442.199
need to learn

439.319 --> 444.78000000000003
next time to just go for the right

442.199 --> 447.3
sources to figure this out and not just

444.78 --> 449.58
like have this tendency to dive in the

447.3 --> 451.62
store because that seems quicker because

449.58 --> 453.06
that was kind of the motivation behind

451.62 --> 456.18
why I did that

453.06 --> 458.78000000000003
and it was not a smart motivation in

456.18 --> 458.78000000000003
retrospect

464.94 --> 469.08
but

466.139 --> 471.84000000000003
I felt I was in a hurry and he was kind

469.08 --> 473.94
of interesting to have a look in

471.84 --> 476.81899999999996
like a big store like that

473.94 --> 478.68
so many people I couldn't believe it

476.819 --> 480.97900000000004
anyway

478.68 --> 480.979
right

486.0 --> 489.139
I had a good rest

492.419 --> 497.94
despite the yeah the in the Restless

495.84 --> 500.84
weather

497.94 --> 500.84
uh

503.699 --> 509.41900000000004
QE live yesterday

506.28 --> 509.419
but it was a mess

509.94 --> 513.199
it was just a mess

513.419 --> 518.419
I was trolling though

515.64 --> 518.419
very much

520.5 --> 526.26
I started to troll them with a

523.74 --> 529.58
with a tate attitude

526.26 --> 529.58
because I thought it was funny

531.779 --> 538.88
Betty was getting all feministic like

534.48 --> 538.88
totally out of place and seriously

539.279 --> 543.0
so I just thought it was really funny to

541.56 --> 545.8199999999999
go all Tate

543.0 --> 548.959
on that situation in the chat don't know

545.82 --> 548.9590000000001
if anybody caught that

550.32 --> 555.24
uh

552.959 --> 556.7399999999999
yeah flatters debates was interesting

555.24 --> 559.22
hope it's going to be as interesting

556.74 --> 559.22
today

559.56 --> 564.0799999999999
because I'm gonna be there live the

561.48 --> 564.08
entire time

568.74 --> 572.9590000000001
all right the after show was not super

570.66 --> 572.959
long

573.839 --> 576.839
uh

580.03 --> 583.0799999999999
[Music]

587.94 --> 593.0600000000001
God there's like all over the news

595.8 --> 598.76
foreign

602.7 --> 608.519
getting a heart attack or something in

605.22 --> 611.7
the game being and all that's like

608.519 --> 614.4590000000001
everywhere now oh yes

611.7 --> 616.1400000000001
because that is what everybody wants to

614.459 --> 618.54
read about

616.14 --> 621.74
I mean like what is freaking driving

618.54 --> 621.74
these stories man

622.2 --> 628.6800000000001
like who gives a [ __ ]

626.1 --> 631.26
that sort of stuff is happening all over

628.68 --> 634.0799999999999
the place why would this thing be shoved

631.26 --> 639.18
like in our faces everywhere

634.08 --> 639.1800000000001
including the Dutch news like ah

639.7 --> 642.869
[Music]

649.92 --> 654.42
and lift the field talking about that

652.38 --> 657.18
entire show like dude

654.42 --> 660.18
I don't care

657.18 --> 663.4399999999999
we get it already we saw all this [ __ ]

660.18 --> 663.4399999999999
happening a year ago

672.3 --> 678.7199999999999
hey star water good to see you

676.44 --> 680.94
touch your arms in there what

678.72 --> 685.019
I don't know what that means

680.94 --> 685.019
anyway hey mtrc

686.22 --> 691.74
I don't know what the hell bliffens is

688.74 --> 695.1
and I don't keep track of what what's

691.74 --> 697.14
going on in the scene or whatever in

695.1 --> 699.1800000000001
Amsterdam because I literally never go

697.14 --> 701.779
there

699.18 --> 701.779
foreign

701.94 --> 705.149
[Music]

707.48 --> 714.36
Ian kind of way the only reasons I ever

710.76 --> 716.279
go to Amsterdam is to get new shoes

714.36 --> 718.5600000000001
and I don't even know if that's gonna

716.279 --> 720.18
continue because those types of shoes

718.56 --> 722.88
that I typically like

720.18 --> 725.6999999999999
that that one guy on the market there

722.88 --> 728.579
always had well I think they completely

725.7 --> 731.1
discontinued production which really

728.579 --> 732.7199999999999
sucks because that means I'm like how am

731.1 --> 736.14
I gonna

732.72 --> 737.76
I'm gonna change my shoes like what the

736.14 --> 739.79
[ __ ] is this I've been wearing the same

737.76 --> 743.02
types of shoes for 20 years

739.79 --> 743.02
[Music]

743.1 --> 747.74
I don't want to wear new type shoes

747.98 --> 755.82
boo whatever anyway nobody cares

752.12 --> 757.079
but I'd rarely go to Amsterdam

755.82 --> 759.36
yeah

757.079 --> 763.8
that besides the shoes the last time we

759.36 --> 765.3000000000001
went there was the 2019 conference

763.8 --> 767.2199999999999
it's the last time I've been to

765.3 --> 769.8199999999999
Amsterdam so

767.22 --> 769.82
anyway

770.459 --> 777.3
ever tried clogs

773.88 --> 777.65
you mean those wooden shoes yeah they

777.3 --> 779.3389999999999
suck

777.65 --> 782.459
[Music]

779.339 --> 785.339
they really really suck

782.459 --> 787.3199999999999
unless you're on a Farmland surrounded

785.339 --> 788.7
by mud all the time and then they're

787.32 --> 792.0
kind of Handy

788.7 --> 795.62
but in any other situation they just

792.0 --> 795.62
suck they hurt

796.019 --> 802.22
and if you trip you you like break a toe

799.019 --> 802.22
or something it's terrible

802.35 --> 814.46
[Music]

817.68 --> 820.399
again

824.04 --> 828.38
I have no idea what you're talking about

831.72 --> 837.0600000000001
foreign

834.06 --> 837.06
branch

852.6 --> 860.22
why do you guys always have to ask weird

855.48 --> 863.4590000000001
questions that I like I don't understand

860.22 --> 864.4200000000001
why can't you just ask questions that

863.459 --> 867.42
are like

864.42 --> 867.42
comprehensible

868.139 --> 873.74
uh

870.0 --> 873.74
hey Terry 306.

875.59 --> 878.71
[Music]

885.139 --> 890.5790000000001
so mtrc

888.42 --> 893.459
explain what the hell you're talking

890.579 --> 895.1389999999999
about I have absolutely no idea what

893.459 --> 897.779
you're blabbering about or that this is

895.139 --> 900.12
some weird random generated crap you're

897.779 --> 902.579
trying to unleash on me or something

900.12 --> 905.0600000000001
but I have no idea what the [ __ ] you're

902.579 --> 905.06
talking about

911.88 --> 917.88
some more work yeah no [ __ ] cheer luck

914.22 --> 921.44
but yeah hello Studio 68

917.88 --> 921.4399999999999
casual look me

931.27 --> 934.4399999999999
[Music]

940.62 --> 943.519
[Music]

941.519 --> 943.519
um

953.279 --> 955.9399999999999
foreign

965.399 --> 972.06
but the funny thing with clogs is

969.42 --> 975.0
which is kind of like a bit of a unique

972.06 --> 975.959
Advantage compared to like just regular

975.0 --> 978.3
boots

975.959 --> 981.1199999999999
right which don't give all those issues

978.3 --> 984.779
you don't break a toe if you trip

981.12 --> 987.12
but yeah you might get stuck

984.779 --> 989.22
in deep mod

987.12 --> 990.54
then again with clogs I don't know if

989.22 --> 993.839
that would you would fare much better

990.54 --> 996.12
but the one advantage is that if

993.839 --> 997.74
like you can't step on a nail or

996.12 --> 1002.44
something with a clock

997.74 --> 1002.44
because it's basically thick solid wood

1004.1 --> 1008.9590000000001
wow with a rubber boot you could step on

1006.56 --> 1011.1199999999999
a nail right so

1008.959 --> 1015.279
that's

1011.12 --> 1017.66
at first glance like the only real

1015.279 --> 1020.0
advantage that I could think of to use

1017.66 --> 1021.92
clocks but hey if you got like sharp

1020.0 --> 1024.559
things underneath the mud laying around

1021.92 --> 1026.9189999999999
you got it you got an issue no matter

1024.559 --> 1026.9189999999999
what

1027.67 --> 1032.519
[Music]

1037.16 --> 1039.76
anyway

1042.91 --> 1045.979
[Music]

1046.28 --> 1052.04
and by way you could easily

1049.46 --> 1053.9
fix that by just having

1052.04 --> 1056.96
boots

1053.9 --> 1059.0590000000002
like rubber boots with hardened soles or

1056.96 --> 1061.94
like steel plates

1059.059 --> 1064.6399999999999

you mean people with like YouTube

1214.16 --> 1219.5
channels talking about quantum computers

1216.919 --> 1221.48
making up conspiracy theories about them

1219.5 --> 1224.66

1232.52 --> 1236.86
the guys that made it

1237.02 --> 1242.6

the myth of quantum Computing has been

1288.98 --> 1294.2

it's nonsense even the entire

they just give a physical demonstration

1337.88 --> 1342.8600000000001
of it

1339.14 --> 1344.24
in a very rough form yeah like why don't

1342.86 --> 1348.1399999999999
you show

1344.24 --> 1349.82
that Quantum Computing process on a

1348.14 --> 1354.5
small scale right doesn't have to be

1349.82 --> 1357.8799999999999
high tech but just show that effect just

1354.5 --> 1360.74
show it do a physical demonstration

1357.88 --> 1362.7800000000002
yeah just like oh yeah the bending a

space-time this is how it looks yeah now

why don't you [ __ ] show it physically

to do all these incredible things when

1390.2 --> 1395.0

you get it

imbued with a mythical idea of this

1494.539 --> 1501.58
supreme effect and all that

1497.48 --> 1501.58
that is the point

1502.58 --> 1510.1399999999999
to keep people Bound in that belief to

1506.36 --> 1512.4799999999998
have those Focus items to reference to

imagine how that [ __ ] is all real and

1512.48 --> 1520.22
that that's the reality that is what it

1515.72 --> 1522.34
is the religious Focus items

1520.22 --> 1522.34
thank you

1528.98 --> 1534.6200000000001

1534.62 --> 1537.76
technical you know

1540.38 --> 1546.8600000000001
right just like a statue of some deity

1543.919 --> 1548.659
is a religious Focus item

1546.86 --> 1552.799
a holy symbol

1548.659 --> 1554.1200000000001
so are these Tech the Supreme techno

1552.799 --> 1559.22
thingies

1554.12 --> 1563.6589999999999
are our Focus items a holy symbol for

1559.22 --> 1563.659
the religion of heliocentrism

1575.799 --> 1582.08
Revelations

1578.26 --> 1584.98
okay the studio

1582.08 --> 1584.98
okay

1592.159 --> 1596.9
I mean it all just sounds like the

1594.32 --> 1600.22
hybridization of these two religions

1596.9 --> 1603.8600000000001
which to be fair I mean

1600.22 --> 1607.279
secularism atheism heliocentrism

1603.86 --> 1608.36
was created by the freaking Catholic

1607.279 --> 1611.84
Church

1608.36 --> 1614.12
they spawned it actively

1611.84 --> 1616.4599999999998
so they're using the same type of

1614.12 --> 1617.6589999999999
systems that they used

1616.46 --> 1620.3600000000001
to

1617.659 --> 1622.4
well corrupt Christianity the way they

1620.36 --> 1626.62
did turn it into a giant priesthood

1622.4 --> 1629.779
system with Focus items and religious

1626.62 --> 1632.0
objects and other people and other

1629.779 --> 1634.159
Saints right everything you're not

1632.0 --> 1637.24
supposed to do according to Christ

1634.159 --> 1640.159
well that's the same way they created

1637.24 --> 1642.5
heliocentrism it's a religion and it

1640.159 --> 1646.5200000000002
uses the same

1642.5 --> 1649.94
systems same method of approach because

1646.52 --> 1653.36
it's like a brother

1649.94 --> 1657.559
to their form of Christianity

1653.36 --> 1657.559
do you understand that

1660.44 --> 1667.3400000000001
I mean it's not just a little

1663.64 --> 1671.6200000000001
synchronicity it's a lot it's like their

1667.34 --> 1671.62
twin brothers in another world

1675.58 --> 1680.72
they see completely unrelated

1678.799 --> 1683.0
but isolated

1680.72 --> 1684.38
if you compare it and you lay it over

1683.0 --> 1688.279
the other one

1684.38 --> 1691.22
the patterns are just so similar it's

1688.279 --> 1693.7
like they're a shadow of each other

1691.22 --> 1697.52
because it is

1693.7 --> 1698.659
heliocentrism is literally born in the

1697.52 --> 1701.799
shadow

1698.659 --> 1701.7990000000002
of Catholicism

1702.799 --> 1706.72
like in it

1707.88 --> 1714.2
[Music]

1712.279 --> 1718.22
see

1714.2 --> 1721.76
so these are just giant relics

1718.22 --> 1724.52
religious Focus items with lots of

1721.76 --> 1727.039
sci-fi stories accompanied

1724.52 --> 1729.86
to be very imposing and give you the

1727.039 --> 1732.1
feeling of oh technology is so Advanced

1729.86 --> 1732.1
and

1732.14 --> 1739.64
and yeah the witch could lead to all

1735.5 --> 1741.32
kinds of paranoid Visions right

1739.64 --> 1743.419
it's just another end of the world

1741.32 --> 1746.1789999999999

1743.419 --> 1748.5800000000002
the AI Skynet

it's gonna happen

1748.58 --> 1754.76
but it isn't happening it can't happen

1751.22 --> 1756.679
but that's being reinforced just like

1754.76 --> 1760.299
they do

1756.679 --> 1760.299
within Catholicism

1761.84 --> 1769.8799999999999
are you seeing it yet

it's not about that at all the studio

1776.0 --> 1786.88
it's about the pattern the pattern of it

that's what I'm trying to show you

1786.92 --> 1790.13

1798.98 --> 1805.96
the pattern of

1802.1 --> 1805.9599999999998

what do they occupy themselves with

1810.86 --> 1816.3799999999999
as a believer

1812.899 --> 1818.84
that is what I'm talking about

1816.38 --> 1821.44
that's where it is like a mirror image

1818.84 --> 1821.4399999999998
of each other

1831.5 --> 1834.46
I know

1834.98 --> 1837.76

could you Babylonian Sun worship yeah

1854.96 --> 1857.32
whatever

1858.02 --> 1866.11
you call it Babylonian then yes my point

1861.679 --> 1869.17

2207.94 --> 2216.82
thanks to Quantum eraser for starters

2213.339 --> 2220.18

2216.82 --> 2222.2200000000003
actually understand quantum physics

2220.18 --> 2224.9199999999996
I do understand what that is how that

2222.22 --> 2226.2999999999997
works like what the core components

2224.92 --> 2230.14
really are

2226.3 --> 2232.6600000000003
it's about knowing the witch path

2230.14 --> 2236.3199999999997
and it's really about the knowledge not

2232.66 --> 2238.2
just an observation etc etc so I do know

what that is

you would have to have like a person

dude I guess the trolls are out

2358.54 --> 2363.16
but they don't have a point though I

2360.4 --> 2365.94
mean I am actually up to just

2363.16 --> 2365.94
I don't know

2366.28 --> 2371.32
like face you address you as I am

2369.339 --> 2374.56
that's why I've even left flirt hunter

2371.32 --> 2378.6600000000003
in there I mean he's called flurfunter

2374.56 --> 2378.66
but he's not making any sense

2378.94 --> 2384.099
and I am actually addressing everything

2381.76 --> 2389.4
like I'm addressing what he can't even

2384.099 --> 2389.4
properly formulate okay because I get it

2389.92 --> 2396.2200000000003
I get that people don't like me saying

2394.66 --> 2399.5789999999997
these things

2396.22 --> 2403.9599999999996
like Quantum Computing is a myth

2399.579 --> 2407.6800000000003
and the AI Singularity idea

2403.96 --> 2409.48
taking over the world Skynet and cerno

2407.68 --> 2414.04
is going to destroy the world rip open

2417.88 --> 2423.94
inspire you and make you dream about the

2421.78 --> 2426.1600000000003
heliocentric reality science fiction

2423.94 --> 2431.339

2436.359 --> 2439.02
sees that

2449.64 --> 2456.2799999999997
I mean this trolling is one thing but

2453.04 --> 2460.06
you guys are just like

2456.28 --> 2461.38
like barely even communicating your

2460.06 --> 2464.52
trolling

2461.38 --> 2464.52
like what's the point

2465.22 --> 2471.339
I mean if you're gonna troll me over

2467.859 --> 2474.7599999999998
something like this then go for it but

2471.339 --> 2477.099
actually communicate I mean

2474.76 --> 2478.42
if you don't actually communicate how

2477.099 --> 2480.339
are you trolling

2478.42 --> 2483.42
it's more like squatting you're just

hello Supreme knowing good to see you

[Music]

2513.76 --> 2523.78
it's that like them describing an atom

2520.0 --> 2528.16
right Rob the truth Yeah well yeah it's

2523.78 --> 2530.619
as soon as they dig into deeper than

2528.16 --> 2532.7799999999997
what is measurable right like an

2530.619 --> 2535.359
electron microscope which is already

2532.78 --> 2537.88
like a digital representation but it is

2535.359 --> 2540.04
like the closest thing you could get

2537.88 --> 2542.38
to actually

2540.04 --> 2543.64
measuring

2542.38 --> 2546.28
like

2543.64 --> 2547.839
the scale of atoms and molecules and all

2546.28 --> 2550.2400000000002
that

2547.839 --> 2552.7
and as soon as you go beyond that then

2550.24 --> 2553.66
it becomes purely theoretical now that

2552.7 --> 2555.9399999999996
theory

2553.66 --> 2559.2999999999997
may be

2555.94 --> 2562.2400000000002
effective in the sense that if you think

2559.3 --> 2565.8390000000004
of it like that and you work

2562.24 --> 2568.54
with that system that the results in the

2565.839 --> 2573.099
practical application of it will work

2568.54 --> 2575.2599999999998
out great will be very accurate right

2573.099 --> 2578.5
but that doesn't mean that the model

2575.26 --> 2580.9
describes oh it's it's protons and

2578.5 --> 2582.76
neutrons and they're stuck they're stuck

2580.9 --> 2584.92
in the middle and there's his electron

2582.76 --> 2587.3190000000004
and it's like with all this space in

2584.92 --> 2591.2200000000003
between and it's spinning it's spinning

2587.319 --> 2594.04
around it that is pure science fiction

2591.22 --> 2596.74
it's it's a conceptual theoretical

2594.04 --> 2598.48
description of what people imagined it

2596.74 --> 2602.16
would be like

2598.48 --> 2602.16
they can't know it though

2602.74 --> 2608.2
nobody actually sees that

2605.26 --> 2611.26
or have perceived that or measured that

2608.2 --> 2613.839
and the CGI has definitely caught up

2611.26 --> 2617.26
with that imagination I mean it's much

2613.839 --> 2620.14
easier to represent it the idea in CDI

2617.26 --> 2622.5400000000004
good visuals than it is to actually

2620.14 --> 2624.7599999999998
measure it because they just can

2622.54 --> 2626.859
they can't do it

2624.76 --> 2629.98
but it's the same effect

2626.859 --> 2633.339
it is a myth

2629.98 --> 2635.92
it's the myth of like oh we we will be

2633.339 --> 2638.0789999999997
Gods we can measure everything and we

2635.92 --> 2641.7400000000002
will know everything that's

2638.079 --> 2644.46
the heliocentric science myth right

2641.74 --> 2644.4599999999996
science fiction

2646.54 --> 2651.06
that there's no limit

2648.28 --> 2651.0600000000004
yeah there is

2655.78 --> 2661.119
right and even though we can figure out

2658.24 --> 2664.5989999999997
how things work

2661.119 --> 2666.76
and have sophisticated models to guide

2664.599 --> 2669.52
us in how things work that doesn't mean

2666.76 --> 2670.599
that those models are literally the

2669.52 --> 2674.079
reality

2670.599 --> 2676.48
in how we imagine it it just means that

2674.079 --> 2677.98
that model works when you use it

2676.48 --> 2681.18
practically

2677.98 --> 2681.18
if it works out

2682.96 --> 2687.46
but it doesn't have to be the way you

2685.3 --> 2692.26
imagine it

2687.46 --> 2693.94
it just it works out it pans out it

2692.26 --> 2696.94
calculates

2693.94 --> 2699.64
correctly when translated to a physical

2696.94 --> 2702.76
measurement Etc right

2699.64 --> 2706.839
so it's a model that is viable like the

2702.76 --> 2709.6600000000003
chemistry periodic table model it's a

2706.839 --> 2712.73
model and it works really well

2709.66 --> 2715.7889999999998
very sophisticated

[Music]

2718.599 --> 2723.7200000000003
no working models better than normal I

2721.0 --> 2723.72
agree of course

2723.819 --> 2730.119
but that's not what quantum computer

2727.3 --> 2734.079
and the AI Singularity and CERN are

2730.119 --> 2736.0
about they're specifically beyond that

2734.079 --> 2738.819
that's the point

2736.0 --> 2740.44
yeah Quantum Computing is claiming to do

2738.819 --> 2742.92
something that they can't physically

2740.44 --> 2742.92
prove

2743.74 --> 2750.9399999999996
AI Singularity is

2746.579 --> 2754.3
imagined to be like this giant Awakening

2750.94 --> 2755.619
collective intelligence that's doing all

2754.3 --> 2759.46
these things

2755.619 --> 2762.099
and we project our own human power

2759.46 --> 2763.599
imagination on top of that there's

2762.099 --> 2766.96
absolutely no evidence for that

2763.599 --> 2769.42
whatsoever or even of a of a conscious

2766.96 --> 2772.0
cohesion at all

2769.42 --> 2774.099
and then there's CERN with their claims

2772.0 --> 2776.8
that they're smashing particles together

2774.099 --> 2779.56
and then getting smaller particles and

2776.8 --> 2781.6600000000003
they're all analyzing it they don't it's

2779.56 --> 2784.54
a lie all they get is a bunch of

2781.66 --> 2787.359
squiggly lines

2784.54 --> 2790.06
and then they Divine this quickly lines

2787.359 --> 2792.819
based on previous patterns of squiggly

2790.06 --> 2796.0
lines they got in order to try to figure

2792.819 --> 2799.06
out roughly from mathematical derivation

2796.0 --> 2801.339
what the [ __ ] is going on

2799.06 --> 2804.88
and then they literally come up with

2801.339 --> 2810.24
models to try to fit what they think was

2804.88 --> 2810.2400000000002
going on that's all it is it's all myth

2842.38 --> 2847.2400000000002
but yeah I'm not expecting a troll to

2844.78 --> 2850.0600000000004
understand that I mean this is what you

2847.24 --> 2852.9399999999996
do so there's probably a reason why you

2850.06 --> 2856.0
ended up being this doing that

2852.94 --> 2858.819
that reason is probably not because you

2856.0 --> 2861.04
get it so much

2858.819 --> 2863.98
because people that get it

2861.04 --> 2865.599
really well they don't end up like

2863.98 --> 2868.2400000000002
trolls

2865.599 --> 2871.42
because they don't need to compensate

2868.24 --> 2875.339
for their feeling of incompetence

2871.42 --> 2875.339
which all trolls have

2876.88 --> 2882.4
yeah so the overcompensation

2879.64 --> 2883.96
the overcompensation of that dreaded

2882.4 --> 2885.88
feeling that you're actually kind of

2883.96 --> 2888.66
useless

2909.28 --> 2915.96
explanation of exactly what I mean and

2913.54 --> 2915.96
why

2916.0 --> 2922.18
and cross-referencing it to figure out

2919.72 --> 2923.98

up as trolls no not really that's not

2963.22 --> 2968.02
true damn it there's plenty of people

that don't really they're not good at

2973.9 --> 2980.14
that ex-girlfriend of mine with the

2976.42 --> 2983.14
three kids that called me the other week

2980.14 --> 2985.66
right she's one of those people she

2983.14 --> 2990.22
knows she's not very cognitive but she's

2985.66 --> 2993.3999999999996
a great great sense of people

2990.22 --> 2996.52
right great intuition Supreme better

2993.4 --> 2999.339
than mine because it's in a way so pure

2996.52 --> 3001.619
and she didn't engage in all this wizard

2999.339 --> 3003.66
thinking like I have

3001.619 --> 3006.06
complications of everything getting so

3003.66 --> 3007.859
entangled she doesn't do that

3006.06 --> 3009.24
right so she doesn't show it's not

3007.859 --> 3013.68
because they don't understand it's

3009.24 --> 3017.8999999999996
because they feel bad about not being

3013.68 --> 3017.8999999999996
good enough to their own standard

3018.599 --> 3022.92
it's because they feel bad that they

3020.94 --> 3025.26
don't really understand that they Bluff

3022.92 --> 3028.92
and over compensate they blow themselves

3025.26 --> 3031.26
up like a guppy like a blowfish

3028.92 --> 3033.119
right

3031.26 --> 3034.7400000000002
to compensate

3033.119 --> 3036.6600000000003
because it's not because they don't

3034.74 --> 3038.16
understand it's because they feel bad

3036.66 --> 3040.14
about that

3038.16 --> 3042.48
because it's okay not to understand

3040.14 --> 3046.859
there's a lot of things a lot of people

3042.48 --> 3050.4
don't understand and let let me tell you

3046.859 --> 3052.2599999999998
the smarter you get the more you realize

3050.4 --> 3053.46
how freaking little you really

3052.26 --> 3057.619
understand

3053.46 --> 3057.619
even though there's so much you do

3060.18 --> 3066.7999999999997
when it comes to understanding most

3062.52 --> 3069.18
people are blind their entire life

3066.8 --> 3071.099
and some

3069.18 --> 3072.839
and now it's debatable whether those are

3071.099 --> 3076.2000000000003
the lucky ones or not

3072.839 --> 3078.7799999999997
they get a pretty decent glimpse

3076.2 --> 3081.0
but with that Glimpse comes a lot of

3078.78 --> 3082.98
suffering

3081.0 --> 3086.099
because the more you understand the more

3082.98 --> 3087.839
responsibility and weight that comes

3086.099 --> 3090.26
with that understanding you have to

3087.839 --> 3090.2599999999998
carry

3092.88 --> 3097.619
right and when you carry that weight

3095.04 --> 3100.2599999999998
you're not gonna troll because you don't

3097.619 --> 3102.42
want to burden others like you are a

3100.26 --> 3105.0
burdened

3102.42 --> 3107.46
people that understand don't troll it's

3105.0 --> 3109.44
the ones that don't understand and that

3107.46 --> 3111.68
feel bad about not understanding that

3109.44 --> 3111.68
troll

3111.9 --> 3117.119
so I want to Bluff

3113.94 --> 3119.52
into themselves and others believing

3117.119 --> 3121.319
that they do understand and they're not

3119.52 --> 3123.72
very good at it

3121.319 --> 3126.48
so they just distract you by prodding

3123.72 --> 3129.5989999999997
you and poking you and trying to make

3126.48 --> 3132.059
you emotional somehow so that you are

3129.599 --> 3133.8
distracted from their incompetence and

3132.059 --> 3135.78
then when you are distracted from their

3133.8 --> 3137.88
incompetence then so are they in that

3135.78 --> 3141.7200000000003
moment and then they are relieved of

3137.88 --> 3144.77
that pain for just a few seconds

3141.72 --> 3146.0989999999997

it is mental illness though it is

3150.78 --> 3155.5400000000004
absolutely mental illness Behavior

3156.599 --> 3160.52
right because it's okay not to

3158.339 --> 3160.52
understand

3161.52 --> 3166.859
you don't have to feel miserable for not

3164.76 --> 3169.1600000000003
being the smartest freaking person in

some things might go easier and you

3187.44 --> 3191.04
might feel less humiliated when

3189.48 --> 3195.119
somebody's smarter just does something

3191.04 --> 3198.66
very easily which is very tough for you

3195.119 --> 3201.559
but that also comes with a price for

3198.66 --> 3201.5589999999997
those Smart Ones

3202.74 --> 3208.859
because they have to face what the world

3205.8 --> 3210.7200000000003
really is because they can see it

3208.859 --> 3214.2
punishing

3210.72 --> 3217.6189999999997
yeah and and ignorance not having that

3214.2 --> 3222.0
oversight is blissful it will be more

3217.619 --> 3225.0
like being a blissful happy child

3222.0 --> 3227.64
if you don't have all that burden of

3225.0 --> 3231.559
seeing through things

3227.64 --> 3231.5589999999997
right so don't punish yourself

3231.8 --> 3237.92
enjoy your ignorance while you still can

3234.9 --> 3240.1800000000003
and try to still attain some good

3237.92 --> 3243.059
behavioral traits

3240.18 --> 3245.5989999999997
because ignorance is okay if you're a

3243.059 --> 3245.599
nice person

3249.359 --> 3254.22
right

3251.819 --> 3256.079
like a good wife

3254.22 --> 3259.3799999999997
in their way

3256.079 --> 3260.52
as controlled ignorance they leave it to

3259.38 --> 3262.44
the Man

3260.52 --> 3263.579
to take care of that and to be burdened

3262.44 --> 3266.28
by that

3263.579 --> 3268.7400000000002
they are not so that they

3266.28 --> 3270.9
don't get distracted by that and then

3268.74 --> 3274.5589999999997
yeah

3270.9 --> 3277.559
so it's a real division like that and

3274.559 --> 3280.38
yeah there is a controlled ignorance in

3277.559 --> 3282.8590000000004
that that is very balanced and

3280.38 --> 3282.859
productive

3286.74 --> 3292.52
anyway

3289.2 --> 3292.52
you're not trolling

3296.18 --> 3299.24
all right

3300.559 --> 3304.3390000000004
where did everybody go

3311.64 --> 3318.44
did the letter there's all just flee

3315.18 --> 3318.44
because of the trolls or something

3320.579 --> 3327.44
ignorance is the wrong word to use

3324.0 --> 3327.44
I can't think of another one

3327.839 --> 3331.74
well there's a difference between

3329.16 --> 3333.54
ignorance and willing ignorance right

3331.74 --> 3335.7
well you're probably talking about

3333.54 --> 3338.52
willing ignorance

3335.7 --> 3341.339
because ignorance can also be innocence

3338.52 --> 3342.72
it's when you learn and then refuse to

3341.339 --> 3345.0589999999997
learn

3342.72 --> 3349.04
that's when it becomes willing ignorance

3345.059 --> 3349.0400000000004
and that's bad that's destructive

3349.14 --> 3353.0589999999997
and talking about a good wife

3353.22 --> 3358.319
right well you can call it

3355.38 --> 3361.1400000000003
innocence or something right Bill not

3358.319 --> 3363.42
the point is I'm addressing it

3361.14 --> 3366.2999999999997
mechanically

3363.42 --> 3368.579
and it's okay

3366.3 --> 3372.48
uh oh and Benjamin by the way talks a

3368.579 --> 3374.579
lot about that specific type of role and

3372.48 --> 3377.579
he has that set up with his wife as well

3374.579 --> 3379.8
and his wife is really freaking smart

3377.579 --> 3381.599
but she's still

3379.8 --> 3384.8390000000004
relinquishes

3381.599 --> 3387.8590000000004
that responsibility of oversight on us

3384.839 --> 3387.859
or in a certain way

3388.559 --> 3394.76
focus is more on her

3390.78 --> 3394.76
domain as a sign

3395.88 --> 3400.8
but that is like controlled ignorance

3397.8 --> 3403.079
it's like agreed upon it's contractual

3400.8 --> 3406.2000000000003
almost it's it's an agreement like yeah

3403.079 --> 3407.46
I'll you take care of that I'll take

3406.2 --> 3410.52
care of this

3407.46 --> 3413.52
but that is a form of ignorance

3410.52 --> 3415.859
you're ignoring a certain thing because

3413.52 --> 3419.42
you're not taking that responsibility

3415.859 --> 3419.42
you leave that to the other

3421.98 --> 3424.46
anyway

3425.48 --> 3432.3
wow okay I'm really bored now flirt

3428.579 --> 3434.8390000000004
Hunter so I'm gonna kick you out I mean

3432.3 --> 3434.8390000000004
dude

3437.4 --> 3443.819
no in content response I literally

3441.0 --> 3446.9
addressed you and left you unbanned in

3443.819 --> 3446.9
my chat you ass

3448.68 --> 3456.44
you don't even address anything this is

3451.74 --> 3456.4399999999996
just like get a [ __ ] life dude

3462.44 --> 3466.429
[Music]

3468.079 --> 3474.02
yeah they can't do that that's their

3471.72 --> 3474.02
problem

3478.619 --> 3480.619
um

3482.78 --> 3486.92
hey Oz good to see you

3495.42 --> 3500.839
right so yeah photos are pretty

3497.28 --> 3500.8390000000004
interesting show so far

3501.48 --> 3504.98
I'm in a good flow today

3508.079 --> 3511.98
despite the weather being kind of sucky

3509.76 --> 3514.619
oh it's getting better

3511.98 --> 3518.299
so weird

3514.619 --> 3518.299
I'm getting less stormy

3534.18 --> 3538.819
I'm going to Rambo on some AI

3539.04 --> 3543.119
right

3540.839 --> 3546.18
yeah that was very interesting actually

3543.119 --> 3548.88
but it really only worked because well

3546.18 --> 3551.04
he recorded it the QE tried something

3548.88 --> 3553.559
like that live I think

3551.04 --> 3554.7599999999998
I don't know where he tried that it's

3553.559 --> 3557.8190000000004
just that

3554.76 --> 3560.3390000000004
it was a very interesting experiment

3557.819 --> 3561.66
that he did that and really revealing

3560.339 --> 3564.599
that

3561.66 --> 3567.24
that the AI has assimilated anti-flatter

3564.599 --> 3569.819
double speak

3567.24 --> 3572.54
it has literally

3569.819 --> 3572.54
done that

3578.16 --> 3581.299
how odd

3590.52 --> 3594.0
right but yeah it was a very interesting

3592.5 --> 3595.92
video and yeah if you if you haven't

3594.0 --> 3599.46
seen that definitely check it out

3595.92 --> 3601.92
because he he asked started asking Flat

3599.46 --> 3607.2
Earth housekeeping questions basically

3601.92 --> 3609.7200000000003
to the AI and it started to talk exactly

3607.2 --> 3612.0589999999997
well like an anti-flat earther would

3609.72 --> 3614.16
respond and even more refined and

3612.059 --> 3616.02
apologetic which is very unlike

3614.16 --> 3619.5
anti-flat earthers

3616.02 --> 3622.02
but it did it did use the same forms of

3619.5 --> 3625.2
reasoning and even like

3622.02 --> 3629.119
apologized for lying and for being

3625.2 --> 3629.1189999999997
incorrect I swear

3629.88 --> 3634.6800000000003
yeah

3631.44 --> 3638.94
makes me feel like that YouTube

3634.68 --> 3641.22
help desk thing was also completely AI

3638.94 --> 3643.619
generated because

3641.22 --> 3646.22
the way it rolled out

3643.619 --> 3649.799
the text there

3646.22 --> 3652.22
very similar pattern to like the type of

3649.799 --> 3654.72
emails that I got

3652.22 --> 3658.22
very similar

3654.72 --> 3661.3799999999997
like that non-responsiveness and like

3658.22 --> 3664.6189999999997
superficial apologism

3661.38 --> 3667.26
that is like AI I mean normal people

3664.619 --> 3669.299
don't respond like that

3667.26 --> 3672.1400000000003
they either get offended or they take it

3669.299 --> 3672.14
much more serious

3673.74 --> 3679.2599999999998
when you just say you're lying which I

3676.859 --> 3681.54
have proof for by the way that they did

3679.26 --> 3683.2200000000003
because yeah they appealed the strike oh

3681.54 --> 3685.799
oh no they didn't

3683.22 --> 3690.48
it's still there you get it

3685.799 --> 3693.54
I mean it's still there right now

3690.48 --> 3694.68
the LIE the proof of their lie is still

3693.54 --> 3697.319
there

3694.68 --> 3698.819
in YouTube Studio

3697.319 --> 3701.96
oh wait

3698.819 --> 3701.96
did they remove it

3702.42 --> 3707.46
oh damn it they actually removed it

3706.02 --> 3710.04
huh

3707.46 --> 3712.68
okay okay it's not there anymore then I

3710.04 --> 3716.0589999999997
guess I guess that they

3712.68 --> 3716.0589999999997
removed that remark

3723.9 --> 3727.46
no wait what

3742.339 --> 3747.599
yeah they've they removed that thing so

3745.68 --> 3751.8799999999997
I guess that they uh

3747.599 --> 3751.88
took it serious then sort of

3754.02 --> 3759.299
not that they actually accounted for it

3756.72 --> 3763.2
I mean yeah it's called a false promise

3759.299 --> 3766.7
and then you should just do it

3763.2 --> 3766.7
I mean why not

3769.799 --> 3775.92
the entire accusation in that episode

3772.5 --> 3779.28
was complete horseshit

3775.92 --> 3783.7400000000002
and effectively I share a lot of

3779.28 --> 3783.7400000000002
information including Medical

3783.839 --> 3787.319
continually

3785.52 --> 3791.4
I just

3787.319 --> 3793.619
don't phrase it in a way

3791.4 --> 3796.14
that it's gonna like I don't try to draw

3793.619 --> 3801.299
attention to it like oh I want this to

3796.14 --> 3804.02
spread no no but I I do absolutely

3801.299 --> 3807.72
demand that I'm able to talk about

3804.02 --> 3812.099
whatever I see fit

3807.72 --> 3815.339
I will not be censored for any reason

3812.099 --> 3818.579
but my own reasons

3815.339 --> 3821.7
like nothing is going to tell me what to

3818.579 --> 3823.26
talk about and what not to talk about

3821.7 --> 3825.4199999999996
and it doesn't mean that I'm going to be

3823.26 --> 3826.92
all oppositionally defined and then oh

3825.42 --> 3830.04
I'm always going to talk about the

3826.92 --> 3834.0
Forbidden subjects then no

3830.04 --> 3835.799
but I will talk about whatever comes to

3834.0 --> 3839.46
mind

3835.799 --> 3843.299
and it will not be scared

3839.46 --> 3846.5
by the setting of priorities

3843.299 --> 3846.5
what you can talk about

3847.26 --> 3854.0
I make those myself

3849.72 --> 3854.0
and nobody's gonna interfere with that

3855.599 --> 3859.099
because I'll just find a way

3873.24 --> 3879.5989999999997
and you can remove I don't give a [ __ ]

3876.48 --> 3882.839
dude I'm right here

3879.599 --> 3885.96
yeah and YouTube removes me then they'll

3882.839 --> 3888.599
lose me because I got all my videos yeah

3885.96 --> 3891.299
it's all right there

3888.599 --> 3895.6800000000003
it's all right there on Odyssey

3891.299 --> 3899.4
and if YouTube Kicks me off okay

3895.68 --> 3902.22
they did that and then I will find a

3899.4 --> 3905.46
completely different platform

3902.22 --> 3908.18
and then I will actually like take all

3905.46 --> 3908.18
the clamps off

3910.68 --> 3916.6189999999997
yeah because I have smoothened and

3913.74 --> 3918.72
softened out everything

3916.619 --> 3920.6400000000003
that I talk about

3918.72 --> 3922.5589999999997
because I have to because that's the

3920.64 --> 3925.799
only way I can still keep talking about

3922.559 --> 3927.2400000000002
everything the moment I want to I have

3925.799 --> 3929.7599999999998
to smoothing it out

3927.24 --> 3932.64
to refine the way that I talk about it

3929.76 --> 3935.099
yeah well if I get kicked off YouTube

3932.64 --> 3937.319
that's gonna stop and you're gonna get a

3935.099 --> 3939.42
much more raw R win

3937.319 --> 3940.68
that's not going to be afraid of getting

3939.42 --> 3944.339
kicked off

3940.68 --> 3946.2
because wherever I'm gonna Nestle

3944.339 --> 3950.839
is going to be a place where you can

3946.2 --> 3950.839
literally say whatever the [ __ ] you want

3951.42 --> 3956.94
except for the subjects that I would

3953.64 --> 3958.98
never want to talk about

3956.94 --> 3962.04
right anyway I don't know where that

3958.98 --> 3965.099
would be but I'm still here on YouTube

3962.04 --> 3967.619
so all this nitpicky [ __ ] it just

3965.099 --> 3971.3590000000004
needs to end

3967.619 --> 3971.359
just needs to end

3971.52 --> 3979.2
do you like no D life is not a platform

3976.079 --> 3981.78
you can stream there it's not a platform

3979.2 --> 3984.18
though I mean the nothing stays there

3981.78 --> 3986.6600000000003
you can't have videos there unless you

3984.18 --> 3986.66
pay them

3987.66 --> 3993.839
not gonna do that

3989.64 --> 3993.839
it's not a good storage system

3997.38 --> 4001.7000000000003
but yeah we'll see where I'll go I'll

3999.66 --> 4004.0389999999998
try to figure it out maybe we'll try

4001.7 --> 4008.359
rockfin a bit

4004.039 --> 4010.3390000000004
but I'm not going anywhere okay I'm

4008.359 --> 4013.0
right here

4010.339 --> 4016.22
I got

4013.0 --> 4019.339
1471 shows here okay

4016.22 --> 4022.8999999999996
does that look like a channel

4019.339 --> 4022.9
that's gonna get kicked off

4026.78 --> 4030.1400000000003
like the people that typically get

4028.94 --> 4033.5
kicked off

4030.14 --> 4036.6189999999997
right do they have

4033.5 --> 4040.16
like 1500 shows

4036.619 --> 4043.1600000000003
on those platforms when that happens

4040.16 --> 4046.359
I don't think so usually get kicked off

4043.16 --> 4046.359
a lot sooner than that

4062.18 --> 4068.319
yeah Tony Whitcomb Tate is a [ __ ]

4065.78 --> 4068.3190000000004
[ __ ]

4068.359 --> 4070.9
foreign

4072.46 --> 4077.2
people I've ever seen

4077.72 --> 4088.64
and he is a absolute sociopath

4083.2 --> 4088.64
Unapologetic unrepenting sociopath

4090.079 --> 4097.46
I don't give a [ __ ] if he thinks that

4093.98 --> 4102.4
he's a flat earther I don't want him

4097.46 --> 4102.4
I want him to [ __ ] rot in jail

4109.51 --> 4112.659000000001
[Music]

4116.01 --> 4125.66
[Music]

4123.08 --> 4128.96
yeah this is not the Catholic Church

4125.66 --> 4131.42
okay it's not like oh if you say the

4128.96 --> 4133.46
little riddle then you're welcome all

4131.42 --> 4135.319
your sins are forgiven you [ __ ] you man

4133.46 --> 4136.759
why don't you become a Catholic then

4135.319 --> 4139.160000000001
yeah

4136.759 --> 4141.88
oh you're you're a flat earther now no

4139.16 --> 4144.739
you're a [ __ ] criminal

4141.88 --> 4147.339
unrepenting sociopath why don't you go

I think that the algorithm is actually

4191.719 --> 4195.4
studying me you see

4197.719 --> 4202.16

4199.16 --> 4205.88

4202.16 --> 4208.699
freaking thinks a lot of people

4205.88 --> 4214.2390000000005
I have a exceptionally High cohesion

4224.239 --> 4231.28

4259.58 --> 4263.96
it's really bizarre to me that there's

4293.54 --> 4301.76
he just wants to be popular somehow I

4298.94 --> 4303.739
mean the guy is just about as luciferian

4301.76 --> 4308.659000000001
as you can get

4303.739 --> 4311.739
like he is obsessed with his popularity

4308.659 --> 4315.82
and with mind controlling his cult

4311.739 --> 4315.82
basically is what it's become

it's only one thing

4494.179 --> 4498.4400000000005
that I find slightly entertaining about

4497.239 --> 4500.12
him

4498.44 --> 4503.36
and that's

4500.12 --> 4504.4

I mean he is a foul Grappler at this

4572.12 --> 4575.36
point

4573.44 --> 4579.259999999999
he is

4575.36 --> 4582.5599999999995
like Ben Shapiro level disgusting

4579.26 --> 4586.400000000001
any wood absolutely warmonger I mean

4582.56 --> 4590.4400000000005
he's always so peaceful but like as soon

4586.4 --> 4593.239
as this happens you know he's right back

4590.44 --> 4596.08
warmongering because he's done that so

4593.239 --> 4596.08
many freaking times

4599.8 --> 4606.820000000001
but it's all about hating Muslims always

4609.08 --> 4615.44
always sucking up to these disgusting

4612.44 --> 4615.44
monsters

4615.92 --> 4621.1990000000005
because they're the alternative Elite

4618.14 --> 4624.88

4621.199 --> 4624.879999999999
like conjure up like this

4624.94 --> 4629.739
alternative Elite

4627.5 --> 4632.36
crap

4629.739 --> 4636.58

4632.36 --> 4636.58
he promotes the worst people

4637.159 --> 4643.159
and here's some interesting people on

4639.5 --> 4646.159
too but always like such disgusting

4643.159 --> 4647.299999999999
people too and he just sucks up to them

4646.159 --> 4649.699
like

4647.3 --> 4652.400000000001
they're great and it's like no they are

4649.699 --> 4654.98
like really disgusting people

4652.4 --> 4657.679
and you keep doing it

4654.98 --> 4659.48
I mean there's bound to be like people

4657.679 --> 4662.84
and the crew and all that that are gonna

4659.48 --> 4663.86
ask like are you sure about that guy I

4662.84 --> 4666.1990000000005
mean

4663.86 --> 4668.599999999999
that's there's a lot of negative

4666.199 --> 4671.599999999999
publicity around him and it's not like

4668.6 --> 4674.120000000001
oh sjws

4671.6 --> 4676.6

4674.12 --> 4676.599999999999
now

4683.239 --> 4689.36
Ronaldo has three Bugattis

4685.88 --> 4693.159000000001

4689.36 --> 4693.159
important facts about people

4695.06 --> 4701.320000000001
too

4697.36 --> 4701.32
enough with the cars already

4702.14 --> 4707.12
got no good word for that guy well I've

4705.02 --> 4709.96
got some I mean in the past he's been

4707.12 --> 4709.96
pretty interesting

4713.3 --> 4719.179
right and Alex Jones has like

4716.08 --> 4721.1
contributed to my

4719.179 --> 4724.159
mission

4721.1 --> 4726.92
basically my personal mission he has

4724.159 --> 4729.92
awakened me when I he was the guy that

4726.92 --> 4735.02
did kind of pull me out when I was so

4729.92 --> 4737.54
like almost ready to die to stay asleep

4735.02 --> 4741.5
like I was so sick like I couldn't let

4737.54 --> 4744.08
go I couldn't like and he basically just

4741.5 --> 4747.14
slapped me in the face hard at the time

4744.08 --> 4748.5199999999995
made me quite paranoid and actually got

4747.14 --> 4750.860000000001
me to break

4748.52 --> 4753.02
to break loose

4750.86 --> 4755.719
for real

4753.02 --> 4757.34
and completely transformed me

4755.719 --> 4758.84
but I don't know if that could have

4757.34 --> 4760.52
happened without him

4758.84 --> 4763.1
I'm not sure

4760.52 --> 4765.26
I would have become very different

4763.1 --> 4767.719
I might be dead because of medical

4765.26 --> 4771.159000000001
procedures that I probably would have

4767.719 --> 4771.159
taken if that hadn't happened

4771.32 --> 4776.12
I'm not even joking uh yeah and I do

4774.199 --> 4777.86
think about that existential type of

4776.12 --> 4780.32
consequences seeing

4777.86 --> 4784.88
right so yeah

4780.32 --> 4786.5599999999995
but I mean the man he was and the way he

4784.88 --> 4787.6990000000005
did things

4786.56 --> 4792.7390000000005
like

4787.699 --> 4795.139999999999
15 years ago it's so much different

4792.739 --> 4797.54
it's so different

4795.14 --> 4800.780000000001
compared to even

4797.54 --> 4803.78
10 years ago when things started to go

4800.78 --> 4803.78
sideways

4804.92 --> 4810.56
right because that was when Trump

4807.44 --> 4812.9
basically that's not because of trump

4810.56 --> 4816.38
but that's when I'm noticing an energy

4812.9 --> 4819.679
change in how Alex Jones operates

4816.38 --> 4822.56
that's and Beyond just like him being

4819.679 --> 4825.7390000000005
typically like a warmonger at times

4822.56 --> 4828.02
super pro America right beside that

4825.739 --> 4829.5199999999995
because he's always kind of had that and

4828.02 --> 4832.280000000001
I get that

4829.52 --> 4835.219
But like after Trump that's when he like

4832.28 --> 4838.759999999999
really started to like corrupt in ways

4835.219 --> 4842.36
in his personal representation and his

4838.76 --> 4844.88
honesty about who he is

4842.36 --> 4849.219
that's when things really like has

4844.88 --> 4849.219
gotten sour and just disgusting

4853.52 --> 4859.6990000000005
and now it's like he barely even does

4857.12 --> 4864.08
any live streams yeah

4859.699 --> 4867.5599999999995
you see him more in advertisement

4864.08 --> 4869.96
in his ads because he spends out a lot

4867.56 --> 4872.54
of time making those ads for his

4869.96 --> 4876.08
products and blah blah blah some prefab

4872.54 --> 4878.179
little video it'll play like 20 times

4876.08 --> 4881.0599999999995
before it changes

4878.179 --> 4884.06
right when he barely even does any

4881.06 --> 4886.52
actual life performances

4884.06 --> 4889.06
barely

4886.52 --> 4889.06
like

4889.4 --> 4894.099999999999
maybe one or two days a week

4897.56 --> 4902.780000000001
you see it more in ads than you see him

4899.84 --> 4906.08
actually doing live stream

4902.78 --> 4909.199
and when he does

4906.08 --> 4911.0599999999995
he's either really tired trying to pick

4909.199 --> 4912.259999999999
up the old format it doesn't work

4911.06 --> 4915.8
anymore

4912.26 --> 4917.2390000000005

4915.8 --> 4922.28

4917.239 --> 4925.639999999999

4925.64 --> 4931.52
the [ __ ] that passes through him that's

4927.86 --> 4934.299999999999
really really bad and like pretty

4931.52 --> 4934.3
demonic

4937.58 --> 4942.199
and I know he's still trying to fight it

4939.739 --> 4943.94
but I think he's losing I think he's

4942.199 --> 4945.4
losing it

did my points make you think

5430.0 --> 5435.28
that is the most ambidextrous thing that

5432.58 --> 5437.0199999999995
she'd ever seen yeah I bet it would be

5435.28 --> 5439.679
the most Empress dexterous thing I'd

5437.02 --> 5439.679
ever see

5440.62 --> 5445.86
it's a pretty neat trick if you if you

5443.199 --> 5445.86
can really do that

5452.41 --> 5456.0199999999995
[Music]

5458.02 --> 5461.02
I've been here for a while was a pretty

5459.639 --> 5463.78
good show yeah thanks Bill my design

5461.02 --> 5464.620000000001
Snyder now I'm very happy about it as

5463.78 --> 5466.659
well

5464.62 --> 5468.04
I think I even handled the trolls pretty

5466.659 --> 5472.138999999999
well

5468.04 --> 5472.139
they seem to be like a really weak today

5474.219 --> 5481.4800000000005
they were just like exhausted so it was

5477.82 --> 5484.36
like they were so exhausted that I just

5481.48 --> 5486.28
didn't even like feel like hammering

5484.36 --> 5488.139
them down or anything it's just that's

5486.28 --> 5489.639
why I left that one I just left him

5488.139 --> 5492.1
there I was like yeah he's trying to

5489.639 --> 5494.92
troll it's just like it looks so tired

5492.1 --> 5498.120000000001
I'm like feeling sorry for him even

5494.92 --> 5498.12
though he's trying to troll

5499.659 --> 5503.44
s

5501.52 --> 5507.88
right but I guess that I'm just pretty

5503.44 --> 5511.78
strong today I'm glad of it I mean yeah

5507.88 --> 5516.179
of this December I've been having like

5511.78 --> 5516.179
moments of like exhaustion myself

5519.28 --> 5523.78
and I'm sorry about that and I really

5521.8 --> 5527.02
appreciate that you guys still like

5523.78 --> 5530.0199999999995
supported me through all that

5527.02 --> 5533.159000000001
I still had some really good subjects in

5530.02 --> 5533.159000000001
between all that by the way

5533.86 --> 5538.96
but I do know that like in these types

5536.08 --> 5541.84
of times I have a tendency to just like

5538.96 --> 5544.78
yeah one or two three good episodes and

5541.84 --> 5547.3
then a whole bunch of just like me

5544.78 --> 5550.12
getting agitated about nobody saying

5547.3 --> 5551.320000000001
anything and like that's not super

5550.12 --> 5553.36
interesting

5551.32 --> 5555.34
I mean it might be like to those people

5553.36 --> 5556.659
that really want to see me get all

5555.34 --> 5559.32
worked up

5556.659 --> 5559.32
but

5562.659 --> 5567.96
your show weekends every time you been

5565.54 --> 5567.96
true

5569.139 --> 5574.4400000000005
come on man that's that's what you're

5572.26 --> 5574.4400000000005
doing

5574.9 --> 5577.739
foreign

5611.32 --> 5617.799999999999
this is just a

5613.84 --> 5619.78
just why why even try that

5617.8 --> 5622.06
why are you doing that like why are you

5619.78 --> 5625.659
making a new account just so you could

5622.06 --> 5628.179
say if you're sure we can get every time

5625.659 --> 5631.42
you ban it through and then you remove

5628.179 --> 5633.1
it like within a second

5631.42 --> 5635.56
and like

5633.1 --> 5638.76
you know it's gonna get that like why

5635.56 --> 5638.76
did you do all that

5643.6 --> 5650.08
is that really worth it

5647.32 --> 5652.0
all that work for what so that I get to

5650.08 --> 5654.6
see your silly little remark and then

5652.0 --> 5654.6
kick it out

5654.94 --> 5657.659
why

5659.62 --> 5662.58
I don't get it

5664.3 --> 5671.139
don't you think that you could maybe

5667.6 --> 5673.3
find more productive ways to spend your

5671.139 --> 5675.159000000001
time and effort

5673.3 --> 5678.1
you can just make suck

5675.159 --> 5681.219
troll accounts just to do all that I

5678.1 --> 5683.1990000000005
mean couldn't you maybe use all that

5681.219 --> 5685.54
effort and actually do something I don't

5683.199 --> 5688.299999999999
know you could

5685.54 --> 5691.139
do something good with

5688.3 --> 5691.139
productive

5691.239 --> 5697.299999999999
even make some money or something

5694.84 --> 5700.26
instead of doing this

5697.3 --> 5700.26
I don't get it

5701.739 --> 5705.879999999999
right

5703.06 --> 5709.96
instead of all that effort just trying

5705.88 --> 5713.1990000000005
to troll me you could just come in and

5709.96 --> 5716.08
I don't know maybe just say hey I don't

5713.199 --> 5719.159
think you're right about this

5716.08 --> 5719.159
here's why

5719.32 --> 5725.98
you know like a normal person you could

5722.139 --> 5728.5
just disagree and then communicate about

5725.98 --> 5731.62
that disagreement

5728.5 --> 5734.38
you say like no no no I I think Quantum

5731.62 --> 5737.139
Computing is real man I mean

5734.38 --> 5739.96
it's like based on the know which path

5737.139 --> 5744.219
sure but yeah I knew this guy was

5739.96 --> 5748.9
building that and and he showed me

5744.219 --> 5751.42
or something like maybe maybe yeah it's

5748.9 --> 5754.239
just that I've never actually seen a

5751.42 --> 5757.36
physical demonstration of the effect

5754.239 --> 5759.4
it's only just oh it's Quantum Computing

5757.36 --> 5761.739
it's super fast it knows the answer

5759.4 --> 5764.379999999999
before you're going to ask it like all

5761.739 --> 5766.839999999999
that mythical nonsense

5764.38 --> 5769.78
you can't keep buying that [ __ ] guys

5766.84 --> 5771.34
it's so pathetic it's just a really fast

5769.78 --> 5774.219
computer

5771.34 --> 5777.219
that's all

5774.219 --> 5779.679
there's no Quantum magic happening there

5777.219 --> 5782.139
it's not been demonstrated

5779.679 --> 5784.96
makes no sense it makes no sense to

5782.139 --> 5786.46
combine the idea

5784.96 --> 5791.139
of

5786.46 --> 5794.26
knowing which path you can't mechanize

5791.139 --> 5797.219
in like not you know electronic

5794.26 --> 5800.9800000000005
microstructures chips you can't

5797.219 --> 5804.28
micronize the knowing which path in

5800.98 --> 5808.0
Fruit it makes no sense I mean how is

5804.28 --> 5810.759999999999
that supposed to work like logically it

5808.0 --> 5812.98
makes no sense why don't you try to

5810.76 --> 5814.8
think about it

5812.98 --> 5817.419999999999
right you could

5814.8 --> 5819.400000000001
communicate with me about that instead

5817.42 --> 5821.26
instead of being like a troll about it

5819.4 --> 5823.96
just say like dude no no Quantum

5821.26 --> 5826.12
Computing is real man I saw it I saw it

5823.96 --> 5828.76
I saw it work

5826.12 --> 5830.26
right now we're gonna communicate about

5828.76 --> 5833.320000000001
it

5830.26 --> 5835.179
or about the AI Singularity maybe you

5833.32 --> 5839.199
have Impressions that'll tell you like

5835.179 --> 5841.84
whoa no man the AI is like sentient I

5839.199 --> 5844.0
communicated with it and it's like it

5841.84 --> 5846.82
proved to me that it

5844.0 --> 5850.0
how much it has learned in the recent

5846.82 --> 5852.159
times and how much more aware it is now

5850.0 --> 5854.199
and was able to communicate that to me

5852.159 --> 5857.799999999999
well that would be pretty shocking

5854.199 --> 5860.259999999999
if that wasn't some dick actually

5857.8 --> 5864.219
pretending to be Ai and being really

5860.26 --> 5864.219
good at the bluff right

5865.179 --> 5870.82
or even about cerns like no man I was

5868.659 --> 5874.179
there at certain I was there when they

5870.82 --> 5877.9
did the experiment dude I felt

5874.179 --> 5880.2390000000005
I felt like the the shock from from the

5877.9 --> 5883.239
impact of the particle and I saw this

5880.239 --> 5887.138999999999
quickly lines that's not just

5883.239 --> 5889.718999999999
like it's not nonsense like I've seen

5887.139 --> 5891.76
the subtle differences between them and

5889.719 --> 5894.699
it's it's really something there you

5891.76 --> 5896.139
could see like this quickly line that

5894.699 --> 5898.9
was like a

5896.139 --> 5900.639
like a micro particle of this type and

5898.9 --> 5905.08
that squiggly line is because of that

5900.639 --> 5907.96
type right and they could argue for that

5905.08 --> 5911.32
they could actually argue based on their

5907.96 --> 5912.219
own empirical interaction with these

5911.32 --> 5915.219
things

5912.219 --> 5917.44
I'd love to have a discussion about that

5915.219 --> 5920.639
the problem is that all these three

5917.44 --> 5923.678999999999
things that that are in the title

5920.639 --> 5927.34
nobody's ever actually witnessed

5923.679 --> 5929.92
anything about it it's all hearsay

5927.34 --> 5932.8
it's the issue it's a myth

5929.92 --> 5934.9
it's a science fiction story it's very

5932.8 --> 5939.4800000000005
compelling it's very inspiring but

5934.9 --> 5942.219
nobody's ever actually seen the thing

5939.48 --> 5944.459999999999
that is supposed to be so Almighty about

5942.219 --> 5944.46
it

5945.1 --> 5948.219
Lucy's squiggly lines when you close my

5947.5 --> 5950.44
eyes

5948.219 --> 5952.179
When You Close Your Eyes well yeah you

5950.44 --> 5954.659
might have a particle accelerator in

5952.179 --> 5954.659
your head then

5966.219 --> 5969.719
right anyway

5972.64 --> 5975.689
[Music]

5981.94 --> 5985.0
right so hey

5983.62 --> 5987.88
are you

5985.0 --> 5990.719
watching this and you thought like oh

5987.88 --> 5992.7390000000005
another cheeky Flat Earth or trying to

5990.719 --> 5995.8
undermine our

5992.739 --> 5998.5599999999995
modern technological development and

5995.8 --> 6001.62
progress well

5998.56 --> 6004.34
argue with me then

6001.62 --> 6004.34
show me

6004.56 --> 6009.84
address the details of what I talked

6008.34 --> 6013.1990000000005
about

6009.84 --> 6017.96
right the actual empirical demonstrated

6013.199 --> 6017.96
proof of the functioning of these things

6018.6 --> 6023.88
like Quantum Computing show me the

6021.54 --> 6026.159
quantum effect then

6023.88 --> 6029.88
right AI Singularity oh really all these

6026.159 --> 6033.08
myths about complete sentience okay well

6029.88 --> 6033.08
show it me then

6034.56 --> 6039.719
right CERN opening up again I don't even

6037.8 --> 6042.42
need to go there just prove to me that

6039.719 --> 6044.88
they do anything

6042.42 --> 6046.32
that they're not just making it up the

6044.88 --> 6048.719
micro world

6046.32 --> 6053.239
because from what I heard it's just

6048.719 --> 6053.2390000000005
squiggly lines getting divined

6055.38 --> 6060.6
right and it's when I say squiggly lines

6057.9 --> 6062.759999999999
that also means like not just like oh

6060.6 --> 6065.400000000001
this line is slightly thicker than the

6062.76 --> 6067.679
other one and shows like micro pattern

6065.4 --> 6070.379999999999
aberrations in its manifestations that's

6067.679 --> 6073.26
how we know no it's literally like the

6070.38 --> 6075.78
same line the same thickness is no

6073.26 --> 6078.179
it's just a direction and how it

6075.78 --> 6080.639
squiggles and that's how they Divine it

6078.179 --> 6083.639
right that's what I heard I might be

6080.639 --> 6085.159000000001
incorrect about that maybe you

6083.639 --> 6089.219
personally

6085.159 --> 6093.719
looked into like the results

6089.219 --> 6095.159
of the of the of CERN right of an

6093.719 --> 6099.06
experiment like that

6095.159 --> 6102.239
and maybe you want to dispute my

6099.06 --> 6103.9800000000005
insight about that

6102.239 --> 6106.44
sure

6103.98 --> 6108.9
I'm open for communication I mean you

6106.44 --> 6111.96
can email me you can leave a comment you

6108.9 --> 6116.48
can show up in my live chat not trolling

6111.96 --> 6116.4800000000005
and we can discuss it I'd love to

6117.95 --> 6126.179
[Music]

6122.52 --> 6128.76
watching cat today she says hi okay

6126.179 --> 6130.1990000000005
Hello Kitty

6128.76 --> 6131.52
mirror

6130.199 --> 6133.94
prayer

6131.52 --> 6133.9400000000005
here

6168.719 --> 6174.36
a weekly and squeakily line I don't know

6171.9 --> 6176.9
it's just that squiggly line sounds

6174.36 --> 6176.9
funnier

6182.1 --> 6187.619000000001
I got it the the word squiggly line got

6185.46 --> 6189.9
really like etched in my head through

6187.619 --> 6192.48
some joke

6189.9 --> 6194.5199999999995
I from a cartoon or something from a

6192.48 --> 6196.5599999999995
decade ago I don't even know where why

6194.52 --> 6198.360000000001
where that came from anymore

6196.56 --> 6202.159000000001
I just know that I find the word

6198.36 --> 6202.159
squiggly line really funny

6207.84 --> 6211.9800000000005
I don't know I don't remember where it

6209.82 --> 6214.38
started

6211.98 --> 6216.599999999999
why where that started to become really

6214.38 --> 6218.9400000000005
funny to me

6216.6 --> 6220.860000000001
because I mean the revelation of the

6218.94 --> 6223.08
Hadron Collider basically giving

6220.86 --> 6225.36
readouts of squiggly lines as I call

6223.08 --> 6228.36
them I don't even remember

6225.36 --> 6231.92
exactly when I figured that out but I

6228.36 --> 6231.92
think it was like Post flat Earth

6232.56 --> 6237.179
although it I might have been told to me

6235.139 --> 6239.82
like even when I was much younger like

6237.179 --> 6242.1
around 20 or something

6239.82 --> 6244.259999999999
but it was like what

6242.1 --> 6245.9400000000005
and I didn't believe it I just thought

6244.26 --> 6247.92
like what no there's no way that that's

6245.94 --> 6250.32
a fake thing that makes no sense why

6247.92 --> 6252.7390000000005
would they build all of that and when

6250.32 --> 6252.739
it's not real

6254.76 --> 6260.4800000000005
so I I consciously figured that out like

6257.219 --> 6260.4800000000005
basically Post flat Earth

6262.159 --> 6267.42
2015. that is anyway

6265.8 --> 6271.58
yeah I don't know the difference between

6267.42 --> 6271.58
a weekly and squiggly button right

6292.88 --> 6299.159000000001
oh I'm struggling with my webcam oh guys

6296.52 --> 6301.38
can you see me struggle with my webcam I

6299.159 --> 6304.5599999999995
mean oh no

6301.38 --> 6305.9400000000005
no not the webcam oh got the struggle

6304.56 --> 6308.360000000001
with it

6305.94 --> 6312.299999999999
I'm gonna struggle with the webcam ore

6308.36 --> 6318.119
so strong the struggle is I can't take

6312.3 --> 6318.119000000001
it anymore I the webcam oh what

6326.84 --> 6331.34
NGL what the hell does that mean

6331.56 --> 6334.52
looks great

6334.8 --> 6338.84
yeah I don't really like the look of it

6342.78 --> 6349.5
I mean it's working right

6345.659 --> 6351.599999999999
but yeah if you watch at the beginning

6349.5 --> 6354.42
of the show I shared with you I'm gonna

6351.6 --> 6356.46
return this one because I don't like it

6354.42 --> 6359.159
I don't like the way it looks it doesn't

6356.46 --> 6360.54
really show the weather outside to my

6359.159 --> 6362.5199999999995
satisfaction

6360.54 --> 6364.5
or something weird with the coloring

6362.52 --> 6366.96
that I don't like

6364.5 --> 6370.02
and it's like over sharpened in ways

6366.96 --> 6371.88
it's like it's it it manipulates the

6370.02 --> 6373.9800000000005
actual visuals electronically and I

6371.88 --> 6377.36
don't like that at all I want it to be

6373.98 --> 6379.98
natural so I ordered another one

6377.36 --> 6382.08
and then as soon as I get that one I'm

6379.98 --> 6382.86
gonna return this one to this to the

6382.08 --> 6386.719
store

6382.86 --> 6386.719
because I just don't like it

6388.8 --> 6392.78
but for now it's functioning

6399.06 --> 6406.580000000001
webcam okay now right yeah I guess my

6403.02 --> 6406.580000000001
struggling with it worked

6413.159 --> 6415.82
foreign

6416.48 --> 6420.5
manipulate pressure systems

6420.84 --> 6423.7390000000005
what happened

6425.82 --> 6430.0199999999995
bye

6428.52 --> 6434.1
Maybe

6430.02 --> 6435.360000000001
I mean it is effectively a giant magnet

6434.1 --> 6438.119000000001
right

6435.36 --> 6441.54
so yeah maybe

6438.119 --> 6445.199
I mean I think that probably you could

6441.54 --> 6448.98
turn CERN into like a harp system

6445.199 --> 6453.379999999999
because it's just a lot of power going

6448.98 --> 6453.379999999999
through a giant magnet

6453.719 --> 6457.8
caller bounds to go yeah I agree Rich

6455.46 --> 6460.86
Cornwall I don't like this cam so that's

6457.8 --> 6462.900000000001
why I'm gonna have it replaced

6460.86 --> 6466.5
I mean this thing looks like it's a

6462.9 --> 6470.759999999999
freaking security camera or something

6466.5 --> 6473.3
it's like yeah this is not a a pleasant

6470.76 --> 6473.3
webcam

6475.56 --> 6482.84
and it'll do great as a security cam

6479.1 --> 6482.84
but yeah that's not what I need

6486.54 --> 6491.88
anyway I think I'm gonna round out the

6488.58 --> 6493.14
show soon can't believe the show went by

6491.88 --> 6494.82
so quickly two hours

6493.14 --> 6498.659000000001
[Music]

6494.82 --> 6502.08
but I guess that having a stumbled upon

6498.659 --> 6504.179
a subject to really expand upon pretty

6502.08 --> 6506.58
early helped

6504.179 --> 6508.86
because that way there's no waiting and

6506.58 --> 6510.98
then being annoyed about nobody speaking

6508.86 --> 6510.98
up

6511.5 --> 6515.34
and I did think it was a very

6513.3 --> 6519.06
interesting subject that is definitely

6515.34 --> 6521.159000000001
worth like digging into this right into

6519.06 --> 6523.619000000001
the concept of

6521.159 --> 6529.0199999999995
the heliocentric

6523.619 --> 6529.0199999999995
Focus items these religious totems

6529.26 --> 6535.08
right like

6531.78 --> 6538.739
the turin's cloth and the spirit of

6535.08 --> 6540.48
Destiny is to Catholicism that's really

6538.739 --> 6543.54
what it feels like with these things

6540.48 --> 6544.799999999999
Quantum Computing the AI Singularity and

6543.54 --> 6548.94
CERN

6544.8 --> 6553.08
feel like religious Focus items for

6548.94 --> 6555.239
that world for the heliocentric World in

6553.08 --> 6557.76
which there is no God in evolution and

6555.239 --> 6561.239
we all become Gods eventually and we

6557.76 --> 6563.400000000001
could go off planet right for that dream

6561.239 --> 6567.678999999999
for that religion

6563.4 --> 6567.679
they are religious Focus items

6568.08 --> 6573.119
for those people that live in that dream

6570.42 --> 6575.4
to remind them every now and then like

6573.119 --> 6577.38
oh yeah it's still going we're still

6575.4 --> 6579.719
working on it we're gonna go to the

6577.38 --> 6580.92
stars together right that's what it's

6579.719 --> 6582.6
for

6580.92 --> 6586.02
that's what they're there for that's why

6582.6 --> 6588.84
they keep getting regurgitated in Media

6586.02 --> 6591.719
as points of interest

6588.84 --> 6593.9400000000005
that's what I absolutely believe I I

6591.719 --> 6595.26
have a case with this there's a

6593.94 --> 6598.28
structure there

6595.26 --> 6598.280000000001
it's it's real

6598.38 --> 6604.02
right but hey anybody that is in those

6600.96 --> 6605.699
fields supposedly working with these

6604.02 --> 6609.659000000001
devices

6605.699 --> 6611.82
I love to hear counter arguments about

6609.659 --> 6614.638999999999
anything that I've stated about them

6611.82 --> 6616.619
I'd love to hear it right so let me know

6614.639 --> 6619.619
in the email or in the comment section

6616.619 --> 6621.9
or show up live in another show

6619.619 --> 6623.339999999999
bring it up again

6621.9 --> 6625.619
all is good

6623.34 --> 6628.26
I'm open for discussion about this

6625.619 --> 6630.719
because hey I might be slightly off

6628.26 --> 6633.659000000001
maybe I did like not completely

6630.719 --> 6635.639
understand it maybe I misunderstood what

6633.659 --> 6638.879999999999
it actually is supposed to be

6635.639 --> 6641.9400000000005
right maybe I bought into like a a rumor

6638.88 --> 6643.08
about it might be I mean weirder things

6641.94 --> 6645.659
have happened

6643.08 --> 6649.88
but if so well you're gonna have to

6645.659 --> 6649.879999999999
inform me about that otherwise yeah

6650.28 --> 6653.59
I'm not gonna update my understanding if

6653.219 --> 6654.9
nobody

6653.59 --> 6658.8
