72.48 --> 79.10000000000001
white button yeah today the weather is

79.22 --> 86.94
like yesterday maybe it's less less

82.65 --> 91.02000000000001
stormy but it's been raining here and

86.94 --> 95.3
clouded and weenie and but also kind of

91.02 --> 95.3
nice there's some blue patches in there

99.6 --> 106.64999999999999
Wow that's weird I'm seeing literally

104.07 --> 110.33999999999999
two cloud banks going in separate

106.65 --> 113.07000000000001
directions like one seems to be going to

110.34 --> 114.96000000000001
the right and but above there there

113.07 --> 116.25
seems to be a cloud further away going

114.96 --> 119.63999999999999
to the left it's weird

116.25 --> 125.28
none of this webcam them can pick that

119.64 --> 130.1
up but anyway yeah

125.28 --> 132.44
I've been up extremely early 8 o'clock

130.1 --> 134.69
because I went to bed really early

132.44 --> 141.51
yesterday

134.69 --> 141.9
12 o'clock actually and yeah for a

141.51 --> 145.54999999999998
change

141.9 --> 148.95000000000002
I did my newspaper round in the morning

145.55 --> 150.989
something else yeah and if my early

148.95 --> 154.85999999999999
rhythm keeps up I'm gonna keep doing

150.989 --> 161.61
that every week and if it's gonna keep

154.86 --> 165.63000000000002
up even stronger I think I'm gonna look

161.61 --> 168.72000000000003
around for jobs just to see what's out

165.63 --> 170.519
what's out there into I don't know give

168.72 --> 175.37
them a sign that I'm kind of willing

170.519 --> 181.22
again willing to try I got new views

175.37 --> 181.22
cause before I was kind of aiming at the

181.61 --> 188.82000000000002
telecommunication direction and yeah

185.67 --> 190.58999999999997
with everything that's now that I have

188.82 --> 193.56
learned and that's kind of really

190.59 --> 196.5
doubled down in my learning I think I'd

193.56 --> 200.67000000000002
be safer just to completely step away

196.5 --> 207.54
from that entire sector entirely that

200.67 --> 209.85
was probably a huge mistake and it's

207.54 --> 213.48
kind of typical that it seemed to be

209.85 --> 216.329
such a good option at the time I just

213.48 --> 218.85
need to step away from that from that

216.329 --> 223.98000000000002
entire scene from everything that comes

218.85 --> 226.28
with it the wireless crap the moods the

223.98 --> 229.81
type of people

226.28 --> 233.5
mercury ins as I call them

229.81 --> 237.95
and completely forget about that just

233.5 --> 240.22
swipe it off the table to try something

237.95 --> 240.22
different

251.72 --> 254.35
but

256.31 --> 266.009
hmm yeah I'm doing the show now and now

264.0 --> 267.84
yeah keep on doing that you know just

266.009 --> 269.58000000000004
because I might be doing something like

267.84 --> 273.29999999999995
that doesn't mean that the show is gonna

269.58 --> 276.15
end you know I figured out I I'm like

273.3 --> 279.569
the greatest expert in the world and

276.15 --> 284.039
that's not an exaggeration in creating

279.569 --> 290.46000000000004
obstacles for myself potentially even

284.039 --> 294.659
other people to if if they allow it just

290.46 --> 296.909
with every step of doing things and then

294.659 --> 300.21
figuring out reasons potentially why not

296.909 --> 302.55
- I'm an expert so I have to just

300.21 --> 304.979
completely step away from that just

302.55 --> 308.009
really step away from it hopefully

304.979 --> 313.83
forever like never do that ever again

308.009 --> 316.91900000000004
and just let the moments happen where I

313.83 --> 319.25899999999996
would potentially be confronted with a

316.919 --> 321.74
choice and then make the freakin choice

319.259 --> 324.36
instead of doing it nothing all the time

321.74 --> 329.18
because potentially that choice might

324.36 --> 329.18
pop up yeah

330.009 --> 337.18
so yeah I've been this morning I've

334.24 --> 340.05
nothing in a good mood like at all

337.18 --> 345.419
[Music]

340.05 --> 351.189
waves of nostalgia in a bad way and

345.419 --> 353.94899999999996
basically going over ten years of just a

351.189 --> 356.34900000000005
giant cascade of continuing mistakes and

353.949 --> 359.559
that's just the thing that I see now and

356.349 --> 363.069
all the rest seems to then pale it's a

359.559 --> 371.259
not a great state of mind to be yet but

363.069 --> 373.87
I think it's necessary yes yeah

371.259 --> 384.099
why else why else would I go through

373.87 --> 386.68
that right now you know again yesterday

384.099 --> 389.49899999999997
I wasn't even too conscious about this

386.68 --> 392.199
process unfolding but I felt it as I

389.499 --> 395.86
said feels like I'm running into a dead

392.199 --> 398.909
corner now I got to figure out how I was

395.86 --> 401.889
wrong about it being at that corner and

398.909 --> 405.039
I'm doing that in my mind I've been

401.889 --> 407.499
doing that all morning first trying to

405.039 --> 412.949
get away from it and then figuring out

407.499 --> 412.949
that yeah I can't get away from it

416.34 --> 423.75899999999996
so I just need it to break like really

420.909 --> 425.49
really break this idea that everything

423.759 --> 430.439
is corrupt and that anything I'll do

425.49 --> 435.33
will automatically lead to me corrupting

430.439 --> 437.97900000000004
and where that fear stems from is this I

435.33 --> 443.10999999999996
don't know this inner talent if you

437.979 --> 445.56899999999996
could even call that to like fanatically

443.11 --> 453.49
radically adapt almost to a slavish

445.569 --> 455.16900000000004
level unnecessarily much and yeah that's

453.49 --> 457.719
been an issue with me that's been

455.169 --> 460.15
haunting me in my entire life and yeah

457.719 --> 463.56
that's even kind of the reason why I

460.15 --> 466.35999999999996
developed oppositional defiance disorder

463.56 --> 470.8
to prevent myself from literally

466.36 --> 475.41900000000004
enslaving myself to others yeah because

470.8 --> 481.87
I don't know it I used to think that was

475.419 --> 483.969
like an artist type of trait and yeah I

481.87 --> 485.949
don't know those who who are really

483.969 --> 489.879
following me on the debates too and all

485.949 --> 495.99
that they may notice this they may have

489.879 --> 495.99
noticed this about me that I just I

496.83 --> 501.69899999999996
really have to choose whether I resist

499.689 --> 504.999
or go along with it because going along

501.699 --> 517.229
with things I'm too good at it for my

504.999 --> 517.229
own taste when I when I choose it anyway

517.24 --> 523.009
don't know if any of you are in the mood

519.469 --> 525.1990000000001
for this otherwise I'll just talk about

523.009 --> 528.589
whatever you guys want to talk about

525.199 --> 531.8599999999999
bring up whatever ridiculous rolling

528.589 --> 534.74
down that down the hill arguments and

531.86 --> 536.36
yeah I don't know if that's what

534.74 --> 539.059
everybody wants I'll just give you all

536.36 --> 541.819
another extra push that's what you bring

539.059 --> 543.499
up I'll push that rock even faster down

541.819 --> 564.199
that hill if that's what you all want

543.499 --> 566.929
I mean why why else bring up racism you

564.199 --> 568.91
know it's not like there's any

566.929 --> 572.41
productive thing that could come out of

568.91 --> 572.41
such a conversation at this point

585.0 --> 589.93
really a lie well I wouldn't be

587.95 --> 593.7700000000001
surprised because it's always gonna come

589.93 --> 599.02
back you know as long as there's an

593.77 --> 602.59
entire establishment rooted group of

599.02 --> 605.3199999999999
people out there presenting through the

602.59 --> 607.63
entire world how the globe is so perfect

605.32 --> 609.88
and it's they're all so smart and they

607.63 --> 612.82
know everything because they can just

609.88 --> 614.4399999999999
assert things and calculate it as long

612.82 --> 618.0400000000001
as that's going on and getting even more

614.44 --> 620.8000000000001
arrogant and everybody's faces yeah yeah

618.04 --> 622.63
no [ __ ] Flat Earth will be coming back

620.8 --> 624.31
as a hide because there's a whole range

622.63 --> 626.17
of people that are going to be bumping

624.31 --> 628.9599999999999
into that and then at some point just

626.17 --> 631.03
realizing like these people are just

628.96 --> 633.7
making up [ __ ] here and there they might

631.03 --> 636.1
even still believe all of it they'll

633.7 --> 639.19
still figure out that these people all

636.1 --> 641.32
of them are just making up [ __ ] and

639.19 --> 643.69
trying to sound really smart they'll

641.32 --> 648.2800000000001
figure it out even if they believe the

643.69 --> 652.8100000000001
freaking globe okay so yeah no [ __ ] the

648.28 --> 655.27
hype again it's always gonna come back

652.81 --> 657.25
as long as this apparatus of people out

655.27 --> 658.9
there are pretending like they're the

657.25 --> 661.66
smartest people in the world and they're

658.9 --> 666.4599999999999
rocket scientists and they'd haul out

661.66 --> 671.68
the dumbest freakin things ever with

666.46 --> 675.46
like in-your-face jokes joking about how

671.68 --> 678.16
stupid everybody is yeah no [ __ ] Flat

675.46 --> 680.98
Earth as a hype will come back over and

678.16 --> 683.61
over and over again why do you think

680.98 --> 683.61
that is Laurie

693.28 --> 704.37
[Music]

724.029 --> 732.42
but he made it exciting again really

728.8 --> 732.42
so what money is that

760.69 --> 763.72
who are considered the biggest racists

763.15 --> 768.2099999999999
in our day

763.72 --> 768.21
well how about leftist politicians I

770.1 --> 777.39
think there's pretty much a consensus

772.69 --> 780.4300000000001
too that people that are gushing and

777.39 --> 782.8
talking about racing sysm the most and

780.43 --> 785.4399999999999
are actually trying to use it some kind

782.8 --> 788.3199999999999
of social pressuring weapon yeah they're

785.44 --> 791.1700000000001
they've pretty much been identified as

788.32 --> 795.6700000000001
being terrible racist manipulative

791.17 --> 800.05
people I think that most people that

795.67 --> 803.1999999999999
have actually thought about that about

800.05 --> 806.02
anything but just taking everything as

803.2 --> 808.3900000000001
is from everyone all the people besides

806.02 --> 811.35
those I think that they've pretty much

808.39 --> 811.35
figured that out right now

815.8 --> 823.39
like the more supposedly what

820.32 --> 826.8100000000001
race-neutral how do you even call it no

823.39 --> 828.6999999999999
racist virtuous signaling against races

826.81 --> 830.56
and the more you do that the more likely

828.7 --> 833.399
it is there is some kind of freaking

830.56 --> 833.399
racism to you

839.98 --> 844.26
I don't know that maybe that's just my

842.08 --> 844.26
opinion

845.68 --> 850.3499999999999
[Music]

866.64 --> 872.15
so guys what have you been up to because

869.94 --> 875.19
yeah I don't stay up late at night

872.15 --> 878.9399999999999
anymore in and when I don't I usually

875.19 --> 886.23
don't have a some kind of wide story for

878.94 --> 890.5500000000001
you all I know is I watched on Benjamin

886.23 --> 896.7
I went over at quantum erasers didn't

890.55 --> 898.7099999999999
add a lot got another stupid remark from

896.7 --> 901.8000000000001
Nathan about how I'm supposedly drunk

898.71 --> 903.8100000000001
because he thinks that's like funny or

901.8 --> 908.8499999999999
something to mention at every single

903.81 --> 911.16
time maybe I'll show just keep on

908.85 --> 913.86
mentioning like hey Nathan you sound

911.16 --> 916.37
like you're kind of lazy and fat how

913.86 --> 916.37
about it

925.96 --> 939.71
right then why would I deny it

934.58 --> 945.5600000000001
I was a little but that's ridiculous

939.71 --> 947.5400000000001
I'm not gonna lie but like why why why

945.56 --> 950.0899999999999
did what you need to say that you know

947.54 --> 951.11
was it really dumb what I was saying I

950.09 --> 954.2
don't think so

951.11 --> 956.57
you know the only issue is that my voice

954.2 --> 960.26
gets a little warp II a little voice

956.57 --> 962.8100000000001
control problem that is it and it is

960.26 --> 965.12
kind of unpredictable because the last

962.81 --> 968.17
time on the Saturday show when when it

965.12 --> 971.69
was life I was a lot more drunk yet

968.17 --> 973.76
didn't have any problems whatsoever so I

971.69 --> 977.3000000000001
think it's also tied in just with my

973.76 --> 979.33
general moral state and as you all

977.3 --> 984.29
remember I wasn't exactly feeling

979.33 --> 989.45
top-notch yesterday as today so I guess

984.29 --> 993.5799999999999
it has more influence although no

989.45 --> 997.25
alcohol today I'll see how that goes and

993.58 --> 999.35
kind of hoping wishing that it's gonna

997.25 --> 1002.68
stay that way because I just I don't I

999.35 --> 1005.35
want to get rid of all of it all of it

1002.68 --> 1007.27
I'll call smoking even while smoking

1005.35 --> 1011.11
already sucks gonna now because I'm

1007.27 --> 1014.76
literally smoking tobacco's that is like

1011.11 --> 1017.23
over a half a years old now or something

1014.76 --> 1019.39
and it's kind of disgusting because

1017.23 --> 1022.63
there's just no more tobacco of the

1019.39 --> 1025.75
brand for sale that I find the half way

1022.63 --> 1028.57
smokeable and I'm waiting for my package

1025.75 --> 1031.15
to come in from Canada hopefully it will

1028.57 --> 1032.9199999999998
with the really good quality tobacco

1031.15 --> 1035.5890000000002
leaf so I could actually have a decent

1032.92 --> 1037.3200000000002
smoke like the for the first time in my

1035.589 --> 1040.4199999999998
life ever

1037.32 --> 1044.47
Thank You Rasta for pushing me to do

1040.42 --> 1046.3600000000001
that like I'm glad I didn't didn't like

1044.47 --> 1048.58
wait for another two weeks for that [ __ ]

1046.36 --> 1052.3
because then I just have to wait longer

1048.58 --> 1056.6799999999998
and so it was kind of an excellent

1052.3 --> 1058.29
timing that's hardcore is it what's a

1056.68 --> 1065.01
hardcore

1058.29 --> 1065.01
well I just

1065.65 --> 1074.74
it's like I'm so frustrated with myself

1071.02 --> 1076.99
for basically identifying even know

1074.74 --> 1079.66
ahead of time all the obstacles like I

1076.99 --> 1084.67
know the obstacle course of my ego with

1079.66 --> 1087.46
things yet I am still not very far on

1084.67 --> 1089.92
the obstacle cars I tried a lot of

1087.46 --> 1092.8
things Skye enough paying a lot of

1089.92 --> 1097.51
attention figured out how it works

1092.8 --> 1100.6599999999999
yet didn't really pass it effectively

1097.51 --> 1103.03
like didn't get myself to a position

1100.66 --> 1105.3700000000001
where I no longer have to walk that

1103.03 --> 1113.29
freakin obstacle course yeah there's the

1105.37 --> 1115.6
problem anyway yeah it's money it's a

1113.29 --> 1120.82
money drain and that money dreams takes

1115.6 --> 1125.26
way options and the options narrow yeah

1120.82 --> 1127.36
that that just causes me to basically my

1125.26 --> 1130.0
ego tries to find other ways to

1127.36 --> 1137.62
basically get in my way again so it's

1130.0 --> 1140.89
not working like this you know thanks

same group of people there's like a

1561.12 --> 1570.3899999999999
whole bowl of [ __ ] out there of people

1566.07 --> 1575.73
that are not even like openly letting

1570.39 --> 1578.22
everyone know who they are that do that

1575.73 --> 1584.82
like you've really do everything in

1578.22 --> 1588.03
their power socially to just try to rub

1584.82 --> 1593.22
as much crap and [ __ ] and

1588.03 --> 1599.6299999999999
retardation in places like this as they

1593.22 --> 1604.07
can that's what they spend their time on

this is not censorship because this is

1668.96 --> 1671.1100000000001

1725.15 --> 1738.0800000000002
yes I know Missouri bear I know I know

1734.89 --> 1740.99
even everything I'm doing here it like

1738.08 --> 1744.46
if YouTube decides they could just

1740.99 --> 1755.21
literally all erase it just like that

1744.46 --> 1757.22
very well aware of it and yeah let's

1755.21 --> 1760.67
just say if that happens and I just

1757.22 --> 1764.66
wouldn't continue wouldn't re-upload my

1760.67 --> 1767.15
old shows people would probably have

1764.66 --> 1769.8500000000001
forgotten me within half a year like

1767.15 --> 1773.5700000000002
entirely if I didn't come back

1769.85 --> 1778.04
I really I'd like I feel extremely

1773.57 --> 1779.72
superfluous now I just realized that

1778.04 --> 1785.18
they're thinking about it like hey what

1779.72 --> 1787.82
if our win literally wasn't here what

1785.18 --> 1791.93
would things be different in any kind of

1787.82 --> 1799.28
way it's being really pessimist here I

1791.93 --> 1802.55
guess you'd remember me but yeah if

1799.28 --> 1806.09
there was really nobody yet if I wasn't

1802.55 --> 1808.31
just bumping around doing my thing yeah

1806.09 --> 1810.98
that'd be a fake memory maybe of a guy

1808.31 --> 1813.77
that's like amusing or kind of smart or

1810.98 --> 1817.66
whatever but really in the grand scheme

1813.77 --> 1822.95
of things no I just fade away

1817.66 --> 1828.89
it's nothing left how much do I really

1822.95 --> 1830.8700000000001
have to offer here it's like I do have

1828.89 --> 1833.6000000000001
some things to offer but it's still

1830.87 --> 1835.82
those things other people can take it up

1833.6 --> 1840.02
now there there's people out there that

1835.82 --> 1844.6599999999999
have a better skill range than me in

1840.02 --> 1847.1
many ways including learning information

1844.66 --> 1848.93
yeah I might be good at figuring things

1847.1 --> 1851.57
out but eventually everything will be

1848.93 --> 1855.47
figured out everything and I will be

1851.57 --> 1858.32
completely useless I just be the stupid

1855.47 --> 1860.929
commenter guy that's

1858.32 --> 1863.72
just trying to find some kind of angle

1860.929 --> 1866.6490000000001
to things to feel somewhat relevant or

1863.72 --> 1871.6390000000001
fresh that's all that's gonna be left

1866.649 --> 1876.9799999999998
and I'm not even being sarcastic here or

1871.639 --> 1882.9089999999999
anything I know there's people out there

1876.98 --> 1885.98
that I guess like me they sympathize I

1882.909 --> 1887.99
am a real person with real feelings and

1885.98 --> 1891.1390000000001
I'm kind of like putting myself out

1887.99 --> 1894.08
there almost like a you know a glass

1891.139 --> 1895.85
closet kind of living situation art

1894.08 --> 1899.899
piece that's really kind of what I'm

1895.85 --> 1902.09
doing but I'm just realizing that all

1899.899 --> 1903.9799999999998
with everything that I do that I'm kind

1902.09 --> 1907.57
of in the process of ever I will be

1903.98 --> 1911.629
completely superfluous at some point

1907.57 --> 1914.75
it's like information wise that is you

1911.629 --> 1918.08
know all that will be left is just the

1914.75 --> 1921.74
way I can present things or if I can

1918.08 --> 1926.09
find funny things to say and that's it

1921.74 --> 1933.139
I'm just being absolutely brutally

1926.09 --> 1936.379
merciless and real about this because

1933.139 --> 1939.32
there's people that are just ten times

1936.379 --> 1942.649
better studied in pretty much everything

1939.32 --> 1946.539
that I believe in ten times better

1942.649 --> 1951.5189999999998
studied and I'm never gonna reach that

1946.539 --> 1956.21
it's like I inside I don't even want to

1951.519 --> 1958.25
yeah what do you do about that when

1956.21 --> 1961.58
you're like wow this guy's really knows

1958.25 --> 1966.159
his stuff I realized I don't want to I

1961.58 --> 1971.99
don't want to have that depth of a print

1966.159 --> 1974.0900000000001
in there but and then I just realized

1971.99 --> 1978.2
today like how many times have I heard

1974.09 --> 1984.4599999999998
that [ __ ] in my head and then like what

1978.2 --> 1984.46
do I do with that can I ignore it

1987.67 --> 1992.679
been trying to alot like especially

1990.49 --> 1994.809
early on because that [ __ ] was like in

1992.679 --> 1997.47
my way when I was a teenager especially

1994.809 --> 2001.1299999999999
but even younger than that it's like

1997.47 --> 2001.13
constantly getting in my way

2010.66 --> 2017.73
yeah philosophical discussions I guess

2013.65 --> 2017.73
well I'm glad you like it

2021.68 --> 2030.26
it to be fair though it really is folly

2026.62 --> 2032.33
sorry and it sound like such passing me

2030.26 --> 2036.41
some [ __ ] right now it's but I do

2032.33 --> 2041.4199999999998
just feel it's all falling so wasting

2036.41 --> 2046.0400000000002
our time like there are so few things

2041.42 --> 2048.56
that really are the waste of time you

2046.04 --> 2051.17
know so it's almost like right or we

2048.56 --> 2054.14
live in a world where it's practically

2051.17 --> 2057.38
impossible not to waste a lot of time in

2054.14 --> 2058.6099999999997
some way you get tricked into start

2057.38 --> 2061.67
wasting your time

2058.61 --> 2064.55
a lot every single person

2061.67 --> 2067.46
there's no escape from it maybe the

2064.55 --> 2070.3300000000004
Amish and they in their own ways will

2067.46 --> 2077.71
have the same [ __ ]

2070.33 --> 2077.71
so I don't know

2079.07 --> 2085.8700000000003
again I feel like it's summer I've had

2082.01 --> 2085.8700000000003
this kind of ceiling and just

2089.799 --> 2097.099
when there's too many dead stops in in

2093.909 --> 2099.4300000000003
progression it yeah it just grinds to a

2097.099 --> 2099.4300000000003
halt

2104.52 --> 2110.66
I'm glad to hear that Robin Stanley's

2106.859 --> 2113.13
sorry I'm being really bad actually now

2110.66 --> 2115.3489999999997
could almost say shooting myself in the

2113.13 --> 2119.81
foot effectively but I'm just trying to

2115.349 --> 2122.73
be [ __ ] honest this is really bad for

2119.81 --> 2125.58
people that have been loyal supporters

2122.73 --> 2128.88
you know like they care they care a lot

2125.58 --> 2131.04
they've helped me and by saying all this

2128.88 --> 2133.8
it's like yeah you just wasted your

2131.04 --> 2136.29
money on me well please don't take it

2133.8 --> 2140.07
like that even though it will feel like

2136.29 --> 2142.41
that little and in a way I could say

2140.07 --> 2146.94
that is kind of meant like that because

2142.41 --> 2148.859
it hurts and when it hurts for me I have

2146.94 --> 2153.29
this weird tendency that I want to make

2148.859 --> 2157.08
other people hurt so they'll hurt me

2153.29 --> 2160.23
that's my ego so I'm kind of trying to

2157.08 --> 2166.589
warn you about that sorry about this

2160.23 --> 2169.53
[ __ ] just I feel like a complete waste

2166.589 --> 2171.839
of space sometimes it's like I have all

2169.53 --> 2177.63
this intelligence and it's all wasting

2171.839 --> 2180.18
it's all wasted on me try to imagine

2177.63 --> 2182.31
like what I've fared better if I just

2180.18 --> 2187.1699999999996
hadn't been distracted by all that

2182.31 --> 2191.7599999999998
[ __ ] intelligence then again I would

2187.17 --> 2193.92
be nothing it's like the very essence is

2191.76 --> 2196.32
like intertwined of me with this and

2193.92 --> 2201.48
since I was so young it's become

2196.32 --> 2205.23
everything and so I can't I can

2201.48 --> 2209.55
literally not imagine really having been

2205.23 --> 2212.25
stupid like for real that you're stupid

2209.55 --> 2216.42
enough that you can't realize how stupid

2212.25 --> 2219.45
it is because I've been dumped plenty of

2216.42 --> 2223.44
times as I said many times before in the

2219.45 --> 2227.1899999999996
last year the smartest of people make

2223.44 --> 2230.4500000000003
the absolute most [ __ ] mistakes

2227.19 --> 2233.5
possible and I've done plenty of that

2230.45 --> 2237.1899999999996
especially socially holy [ __ ]

2233.5 --> 2237.19
so pathetic

2246.61 --> 2253.1200000000003
and yeah you guys have not seen anything

2249.46 --> 2260.17
of that by the way no I haven't been

2253.12 --> 2264.4
that pathetic and just sad and like up

2260.17 --> 2267.61
to grovelling levels guys I've been like

2264.4 --> 2278.44
that as a teenager and before that just

2267.61 --> 2284.4100000000003
terrible I in a way mastered sick of

2278.44 --> 2286.93
fancy it's like I I really thought back

2284.41 --> 2288.49
then in it in the sort of a delusion

2286.93 --> 2291.91
setting that there was like a thing

2288.49 --> 2295.8999999999996
because it was liberal if you're just

2291.91 --> 2299.0499999999997
really freaking liberal even if it makes

2295.9 --> 2302.02
no sense and the insanity surrender is

2299.05 --> 2305.8
like part of that [ __ ] it's like the

2302.02 --> 2310.63
ultimate sick of fan squirting and I've

2305.8 --> 2314.7000000000003
done that [ __ ] it's makes me just want

2310.63 --> 2314.7000000000003
to rip my guts out

2317.97 --> 2323.72
but not because I did that but because

2326.48 --> 2340.95
it's so ugly it's so ugly on me it's

2336.99 --> 2344.1899999999996
like I understand why it happened well

2340.95 --> 2345.7999999999997
for some reason I can't seem to really

2344.19 --> 2348.7400000000002
forgive myself

2345.8 --> 2351.63
not really it's like I know

2348.74 --> 2354.41
pragmatically I have to get over it if I

2351.63 --> 2359.54
ever want to fix it

2354.41 --> 2365.3689999999997
counterbalance all that [ __ ] but I can't

2359.54 --> 2369.92
really forgive it like the you know it's

2365.369 --> 2377.069
it's an energy thing it's no I

2369.92 --> 2379.56
understand why it happened but I I i

2377.069 --> 2382.19
just keep on wishing that it never

2379.56 --> 2382.19
happens

2394.609 --> 2401.42
sycophant ISM whatever being sick

2398.82 --> 2401.42
authentic

2406.01 --> 2413.8390000000004
I don't know if it's a word I made it a

2408.2 --> 2416.27
word I do that to deal with it if it's

2413.839 --> 2419.21
really wrong it'll just sound stupid and

2416.27 --> 2424.099
everybody will forget about it because I

2419.21 --> 2426.88
build words they have to otherwise you

2424.099 --> 2426.88
just get stuck

2430.97 --> 2442.1099999999997
you could just look it up on Google okay

2435.21 --> 2447.14
it's a word it's single word it's not

2442.11 --> 2447.1400000000003
off sick Oh fans

2483.06 --> 2488.06
yeah exactly that's exactly what it is

2489.08 --> 2499.83
anyways sycophantic is like it basically

2497.67 --> 2503.84
comes down to freaking cocking it's like

2499.83 --> 2508.29
the sycophantic is what cocking has

2503.84 --> 2514.79
become in the modern slang tongue with

2508.29 --> 2514.79
more of bat on top of it as well yeah

2524.23 --> 2532.89
it's like sync authentic it's so yeah

2528.7 --> 2532.89
almost synonymous with politicians

2533.19 --> 2537.7000000000003
because they're all like that in one way

2535.869 --> 2545.349
or another always sucking up to

2537.7 --> 2549.609
something kako fans yeah that's not

2545.349 --> 2552.1600000000003
gonna that's not gonna last all right

2549.609 --> 2555.25
Ali Anka yeah don't mind me I'm in a

2552.16 --> 2558.5989999999997
shitty mood today so I just get really

2555.25 --> 2558.599
rough for no good reason

2572.46 --> 2575.46
right

2597.4 --> 2602.85
all right good there as schadenfreude

2604.88 --> 2608.5
not familiar with that

2623.67 --> 2629.03
hmm

2625.83 --> 2635.7799999999997
okay it's German it's basically like

2629.03 --> 2635.78
sadistic flash oh yeah it makes sense

2635.87 --> 2648.0899999999997
because it's basically damage joy that's

2645.87 --> 2651.98
basically what it translates to from

2648.09 --> 2651.98
German literally the word

2657.619 --> 2664.26
hmm not too familiar with the German

2661.009 --> 2668.359
language right away with that

2664.26 --> 2668.3590000000004
[Music]

2672.02 --> 2680.45
like would I like it's a theme topic now

2675.53 --> 2682.0400000000004
to cheer me up I don't know I really

2680.45 --> 2684.3399999999997
can't think of a thing or otherwise I

2682.04 --> 2687.71
probably would have brought it up myself

2684.34 --> 2690.05
you know like everything out there still

2687.71 --> 2693.05
go going you know the birds are the

2690.05 --> 2694.8500000000004
little youngster birds are all getting a

2693.05 --> 2699.65
lot of noisy er and noisier so they're

2694.85 --> 2701.71
definitely growing so that's good news I

2699.65 --> 2701.71
guess

2703.46 --> 2706.61
[Music]

2717.25 --> 2723.55
the rectangular looping theory I know

2719.859 --> 2729.49
it's there's so little to talk about

2723.55 --> 2731.8900000000003
really good servant the its it basically

2729.49 --> 2734.41
just comes down to hey what about the

2731.89 --> 2737.74
orientation and the potential that can

2734.41 --> 2740.17
run out of that you know but it's so

2737.74 --> 2745.8689999999997
short these days it's like yeah what's

2740.17 --> 2747.55
the equatorial orientation and if I

2745.869 --> 2749.92
bring that up even on Nathan Show then

2747.55 --> 2753.849
anything immediately likes to oh but

2749.92 --> 2756.88
what is the equator let's let's move it

2753.849 --> 2763.569
away from that pretty good question you

2756.88 --> 2765.6400000000003
know but it's really just that that's

2763.569 --> 2768.73
the thing that needs to be done what's

2765.64 --> 2772.06
the celestial equal equatorial

2768.73 --> 2775.29
orientation and we have to explain not

2772.06 --> 2782.95
explore measure it's all about measuring

2775.29 --> 2786.2799999999997
as literal as possible just get us the

2782.95 --> 2789.45
the absolute zenith points that's what

2786.28 --> 2793.21
it's called of the Sun hides under the

2789.45 --> 2797.109
equator like point by point by point

2793.21 --> 2800.29
every single point and just put a

2797.109 --> 2803.77
freaking ruler next to it as literal as

2800.29 --> 2807.22
you can and just get the orientation is

2803.77 --> 2809.589
it is it a circle as all the discus

2807.22 --> 2812.97
would love it to be because then they

2809.589 --> 2815.589
were right in some way they were right

2812.97 --> 2818.2599999999998
even though it's yes you know whatever

2815.589 --> 2823.089
may still in there may still be folded

2818.26 --> 2825.13
space at the north and all that or is it

2823.089 --> 2828.52
an arc this is like an incomplete arc

2825.13 --> 2830.6800000000003
and then things get weird or is it the

2828.52 --> 2832.089
straight line then yeah that it's a

2830.68 --> 2834.21
straight line then it must be

2832.089 --> 2836.89
rectangular looping

2834.21 --> 2839.43
specifically and the looping part the

2836.89 --> 2843.7
looping part becomes absolutely

2839.43 --> 2846.48
inevitable if the Equator is literally a

2843.7 --> 2846.48
straight line

2867.569 --> 2875.599
a gem there seemed to be little virtuous

2872.819 --> 2875.599
signaling there but

2876.199 --> 2885.2090000000003
it's fine just kidding no preying on me

2884.13 --> 2889.489
oh dear

2885.209 --> 2889.489
a my prey

2895.78 --> 2901.3900000000003
watch out people Robin Stanley is

2898.46 --> 2901.39
preying on chat

2905.76 --> 2919.1400000000003
now I know what you meant is just mixing

2908.82 --> 2922.76
up the words it's ridiculous Jeffrey

2919.14 --> 2928.17
bill that person no longer lives

2922.76 --> 2932.0600000000004
the idea of racism is that's like a late

2928.17 --> 2932.06
19th century invention

2941.69 --> 2949.44
thank you a lianca for the to Euro 29

2946.609 --> 2954.47
super chair donation or a tower win

2949.44 --> 2957.66
wishing you more positivism today made

2954.47 --> 2959.6
that will do good although I don't know

2957.66 --> 2963.27
I don't know where it's gonna go just

2959.6 --> 2965.8399999999997
know that a free pissed off today by a

2963.27 --> 2965.84
lot of things

2972.079 --> 2977.529
Oh Trotsky hmm

2984.48 --> 2987.26
right

2989.8 --> 2994.6200000000003
okay so in early 20th century then

3015.0 --> 3020.5
yeah

3017.26 --> 3023.32
the Missouri bear both you and Jeffrey

3020.5 --> 3026.95
bill are correct Debra's just saying

3023.32 --> 3030.0
people are people they are whether

3026.95 --> 3030.0
people are different

3042.33 --> 3047.68
well Jeffrey belet's it's kind of simple

3045.13 --> 3054.01
mechanism really it's just that misery

3047.68 --> 3057.54
loves company that's what the

3054.01 --> 3057.5400000000004
schadenfreude is all about

3070.4 --> 3076.46
footballer now that's not necessary the

3072.859 --> 3080.21
baller it's more really the growler

3076.46 --> 3086.119
cycle like nobody has more schadenfreude

3080.21 --> 3092.23
then but then grab lers it's like yeah

3086.119 --> 3095.48
that's pretty can't get closer to that

3092.23 --> 3102.65
like in principle even then with

3095.48 --> 3104.599
grapplers they're the real bad ones like

3102.65 --> 3109.7000000000003
for me that's like an identification

3104.599 --> 3113.599
mark like I personally like even it for

3109.7 --> 3115.279
example if a baller the one yeah even if

3113.599 --> 3115.819
they're really stupid or delusional or

3115.279 --> 3120.26
liars

3115.819 --> 3123.17
they get really crushed I'm still there

3120.26 --> 3128.029
basically seeing if things don't go too

3123.17 --> 3130.369
far because yeah like I always feel like

3128.029 --> 3133.46
they should only be punished exactly for

3130.369 --> 3135.8900000000003
what they've done and kind of forgiving

3133.46 --> 3139.25
because yeah they're just so deep into

3135.89 --> 3143.75
that hole they've rolled so far down

3139.25 --> 3147.589
that hill that's just yeah you can you

3143.75 --> 3149.119
can basically blame them for him and

3147.589 --> 3153.3089999999997
it's maybe that sounds a little crazy

3149.119 --> 3156.44
it's like yeah you can't blame a

3153.309 --> 3160.119
pathological liar for lying

3156.44 --> 3163.069
I made that that sounds kind of [ __ ]

3160.119 --> 3165.4300000000003
counterintuitive but it's because

3163.069 --> 3172.64
they've just they don't know any better

3165.43 --> 3174.9199999999996
you know so sometimes I just wish like

3172.64 --> 3176.839
no no no calm it down we're literally

3174.92 --> 3182.4700000000003
dealing with mental patients and you

3176.839 --> 3187.16
can't just keep on attacking it

3182.47 --> 3190.27
aggressively no but yeah that's all

3187.16 --> 3190.27
working out all fine

3193.28 --> 3199.25
but yeah people like rumpus for example

3196.52 --> 3201.83
now he really pushes the limit you know

3199.25 --> 3204.38
so I totally get people like Nathan get

3201.83 --> 3208.97
so livid on him cuz he keeps him doing

3204.38 --> 3213.23
it every single time for years but

3208.97 --> 3217.7
sometimes he's like he really doesn't

3213.23 --> 3220.94
get a chance to basically show what he's

3217.7 --> 3222.71
been working on the new tricks like he's

3220.94 --> 3225.89
been working because he really is like a

3222.71 --> 3228.68
juggler he's like a very apps juggler

3225.89 --> 3230.6299999999997
with words and sometimes it's almost

3228.68 --> 3233.54
like ah come on just let him show his

3230.63 --> 3235.9700000000003
new trick you know we know it's [ __ ]

3233.54 --> 3240.34
of course it's gonna be [ __ ] I just

3235.97 --> 3240.3399999999997
want to see what type of [ __ ] it is

3242.86 --> 3248.36
but yeah not everybody's in for the mood

3246.08 --> 3252.56
for that always especially when QE is

3248.36 --> 3256.94
around but yeah Nathan's also tends to

3252.56 --> 3260.229
get very sick very quickly from rhombus

3256.94 --> 3260.2290000000003
[Music]

3267.65 --> 3274.58
a mark alert yeah good servant well be

3271.79 --> 3277.13
careful with with too much sympathy for

3274.58 --> 3280.0099999999998
it you know it's that's not what I was

3277.13 --> 3284.36
trying to do I it's not about having

3280.01 --> 3287.23
sympathy for them because they are just

3284.36 --> 3290.32
deviants basically intellectual honesty

3287.23 --> 3300.62
wise deviants

3290.32 --> 3303.6800000000003
it's just that yeah it's like yeah that

3300.62 --> 3305.81
they do still do things and it's like I

3303.68 --> 3307.3999999999996
don't know man I did it's tough to

3305.81 --> 3310.34
explain it the right way it's not

3307.4 --> 3311.75
because of sympathy because it still

3310.34 --> 3313.78
take them as their it's just that I

3311.75 --> 3316.1
still think there's something

3313.78 --> 3318.02
interesting that could come out of it if

3316.1 --> 3323.92
you just let them do their thing a

3318.02 --> 3323.92
little that's it

3346.349 --> 3361.469
Nathan's show is redundant do you think

3354.499 --> 3363.419
right that's a pretty big one to say but

3361.469 --> 3365.16
yeah a lot of the times that does seem

3363.419 --> 3368.3689999999997
to be the case but it's not always you

3365.16 --> 3371.3689999999997
know it look I've been doing it for very

3368.369 --> 3372.779
long time way longer than I've even done

3371.369 --> 3380.5190000000002
the early work show okay

3372.779 --> 3385.589
and it's the whole process is almost

3380.519 --> 3388.229
like a yeah like it's not it's all

3385.589 --> 3391.709
native like nature and we're all just

3388.229 --> 3394.0789999999997
animals and we go with the flow and some

3391.709 --> 3396.3289999999997
days it's just that bubbling and there's

3394.079 --> 3398.6090000000004
like energy everywhere and we all want

3396.329 --> 3401.069
to jump at the mic and we all have jokes

3398.609 --> 3403.679
in other days it's like it's some we're

3401.069 --> 3406.64
all very calm down and don't have a lot

3403.679 --> 3410.4590000000003
of input rather would listen to others

3406.64 --> 3413.669
it's yeah and sometimes it doesn't

3410.459 --> 3415.3799999999997
really work out like that that can be a

3413.669 --> 3418.4089999999997
bit frustrating and then things get a

3415.38 --> 3423.63
little slow but hey sometimes like a

3418.409 --> 3425.339
baller can get on and then yeah it can

3423.63 --> 3428.789
get halfway interesting

3425.339 --> 3431.13
I personally am still very interested in

3428.789 --> 3433.679
the type of machinations that the

3431.13 --> 3436.219
ballers try out I'm interested in that

3433.679 --> 3436.219
trickery

3451.74 --> 3462.66
okay Amanda you thanks for putting me on

3456.21 --> 3472.619
the number one at least this is Randy

3462.66 --> 3477.5989999999997
still interesting though I don't know if

3472.619 --> 3484.71
you think so I don't want him anymore

3477.599 --> 3486.3900000000003
like at all it's just like I don't even

3484.71 --> 3491.03
want to get into it I think I spend

3486.39 --> 3491.0299999999997
enough time explaining it two days ago

3511.14 --> 3518.489
right avi Kim thought that yeah it

3516.42 --> 3521.2490000000003
sometimes feels like that but again

3518.489 --> 3526.739
again that's sometimes and other times

3521.249 --> 3528.839
it's it's all great you know it's a

3526.739 --> 3530.849
great place to have especially when

3528.839 --> 3534.96
there's just new data rolling in and all

3530.849 --> 3538.13
that then it's great to have them around

3534.96 --> 3540.569
oh by the way thank you who's that Oh

3538.13 --> 3544.819
Missouri bear thank you for becoming an

3540.569 --> 3548.299
arcane Archer nice thanks for joining

3544.819 --> 3548.299
it's awesome

3575.13 --> 3583.57
hmm mark colored I completely agree the

3579.79 --> 3585.82
chat over at the Flat Earth debate is

3583.57 --> 3588.3700000000003
complete trash but Nathan's been very

3585.82 --> 3592.29
open about that it's just like he's

3588.37 --> 3593.5
literally just using it to display the

3592.29 --> 3596.68
insane

3593.5 --> 3600.07
demonic zealous religious behavior of

3596.68 --> 3602.2599999999998
how bad it gets with ballers and they

3600.07 --> 3604.63
all think it's just hilarious and funny

3602.26 --> 3607.78
they don't realize that it's basically

3604.63 --> 3610.6
just yeah their insanity is being

3607.78 --> 3613.03
recorded and they think it's all fine

3610.6 --> 3615.88
because they believe that anything goes

3613.03 --> 3618.2200000000003
like insanity and demonic behavior are

3615.88 --> 3622.0
not insanity and demonic behavior if

3618.22 --> 3624.6099999999997
you're doing it against Flat Earth in

3622.0 --> 3627.58
your feelings there's another group in

3624.61 --> 3630.1
the world political group that has the

3627.58 --> 3633.67
strong tendency to also do this with

3630.1 --> 3636.3399999999997
everything and guess what

3633.67 --> 3639.04
they always wrong they're always wrong

3636.34 --> 3641.98
when they do that because when you dive

3639.04 --> 3645.58
into really bad behavior and lying and

3641.98 --> 3648.22
[ __ ] and you try to justify it for

3645.58 --> 3650.41
political reasons which one is what that

3648.22 --> 3652.75
is saying oh because it's flatter than

3650.41 --> 3654.85
anything goes or guess what

3652.75 --> 3657.93
other people are not gonna see it like

3654.85 --> 3661.6
that unless they're exactly like you

3657.93 --> 3666.85
they're just gonna see wow what are

3661.6 --> 3669.87
these people saying it's just that's

3666.85 --> 3669.87
creepy as [ __ ]

3673.5 --> 3677.88
it's like most of the things that they

3675.51 --> 3679.28
say just makes them look like complete

3677.88 --> 3683.6400000000003
sociopaths

3679.28 --> 3686.7900000000004
like really bad ones and they almost

3683.64 --> 3690.75
pride it they almost refine their skills

3686.79 --> 3694.68
in how disgusting and triggering you

3690.75 --> 3698.49
could call it they can be but it's still

3694.68 --> 3703.95
them doing it they're the ones that

3698.49 --> 3707.24
actually put that out it's on them it's

3703.95 --> 3710.54
on record recorded in them in their soul

3707.24 --> 3713.22
yeah they may look at it a certain way

3710.54 --> 3716.22
but what if that eventually kind of

3713.22 --> 3719.0299999999997
drops away and they see exactly what

3716.22 --> 3723.1499999999996
they've been doing and what that is and

3719.03 --> 3728.19
it starts to get a little close why do

3723.15 --> 3730.4700000000003
you do that well they probably roll off

3728.19 --> 3733.71
and start squirting about some other

3730.47 --> 3738.2999999999997
subject somewhere else probably because

3733.71 --> 3740.55
yeah they're never gonna really stay out

3738.3 --> 3743.1600000000003
of that cycle yeah once you delve in

3740.55 --> 3746.34
that deep into the darkness even if it's

3743.16 --> 3750.18
just trolling it's almost no way you can

3746.34 --> 3753.1200000000003
get out of that again because it is like

3750.18 --> 3755.64
a maniacal little gamma power trip and

3753.12 --> 3759.5699999999997
it is effective it gives the little

3755.64 --> 3762.6299999999997
squirt in their head and that's

3759.57 --> 3764.28
addictive so yeah once a troll but you

3762.63 --> 3768.26
get polluted what you get

3764.28 --> 3771.8700000000003
troll blood in there it doesn't go away

3768.26 --> 3774.2400000000002
and hey the same goes for don't like to

3771.87 --> 3778.97
talk about it really [ __ ] up sick

3774.24 --> 3780.33
people that like like a really sick

3778.97 --> 3783.9599999999996
carnage

3780.33 --> 3786.84
murder related disgusting [ __ ] that I

3783.96 --> 3789.57
don't want to talk about yeah once you

3786.84 --> 3791.76
tap into that it becomes you once you

3789.57 --> 3793.4100000000003
make a mistake and that is what trolling

3791.76 --> 3796.17
is it's a mistake it's funny it's

3793.41 --> 3798.18
amusing especially the first time when

3796.17 --> 3801.39
you figure out like oh wow they don't

3798.18 --> 3802.3689999999997
see how unsecure i am i can just say

3801.39 --> 3805.0989999999997
pretend

3802.369 --> 3807.7690000000002
yeah once they make that mistake and

3805.099 --> 3811.369
they don't overcome that mistake then

3807.769 --> 3814.8489999999997
they become the mistake and then in the

3811.369 --> 3822.589
end the mistake becomes them it works

3814.849 --> 3824.349
for everything everything all right and

3822.589 --> 3827.359
it's also part of the reason why I'm

3824.349 --> 3830.119
kind of desperate sometimes to literally

3827.359 --> 3832.339
throw everything in here in my heart

3830.119 --> 3834.319
thinks that instinctively I don't want

3832.339 --> 3836.359
anyone to know throw it out there

3834.319 --> 3839.299
because I don't want to become this

3836.359 --> 3841.699
mistake I don't want to become these

3839.299 --> 3849.699
mistakes that I've been kind of carrying

3841.699 --> 3854.7090000000003
around shaped me I don't want them to

3849.699 --> 3856.88
finalize and seal my fate as it were

3854.709 --> 3858.9489999999996
don't know if that makes any sense

3856.88 --> 3861.949
