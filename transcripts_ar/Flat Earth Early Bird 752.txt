129.599 --> 134.64
all right i was kind of yeah a little

132.16 --> 138.879
bit late i was watching

134.64 --> 142.0
a video nathan thompson

138.879 --> 143.67999999999998
was streaming and yeah it was

142.0 --> 145.2
it was really interesting i think i've

143.68 --> 148.64000000000001
seen it before

145.2 --> 151.83999999999997
or other videos very similar to it

148.64 --> 154.95899999999997
basically somebody digs into

151.84 --> 157.04
catholicism and islam and yeah just

154.959 --> 158.8
all the little details out there and

157.04 --> 161.84
basically about

158.8 --> 166.56
the secret societies within them

161.84 --> 166.56
and how they're very similar it's just

168.84 --> 172.239
interesting

170.4 --> 174.4
so yeah i didn't get to finish it though

172.239 --> 176.16
but i will finish it

174.4 --> 177.44
after the show because it was a really

176.16 --> 182.72
interesting stream i got

177.44 --> 182.72
up until 35 33 minutes

182.84 --> 185.84
outfitting

196.84 --> 205.519
right okay

200.0 --> 205.519
thanks for that uh rob h good to see you

206.239 --> 213.84
right so yeah yesterday

210.0 --> 213.84
it's quite busy

216.56 --> 223.04
there was a uh owen benjamin

220.56 --> 223.599
live after the flat earth early bird

223.04 --> 225.519
show

223.599 --> 226.959
which i thought was pretty good it was

225.519 --> 229.68
intense though

226.959 --> 230.159
yesterday hopefully today it'll be a

229.68 --> 233.439
little bit

230.159 --> 236.0
calmer uh

233.439 --> 237.84
yeah and also ball buster is live again

236.0 --> 239.36
it was really good to be with the guys

237.84 --> 243.519
and oh god

239.36 --> 246.72000000000003
like we just kept on going

243.519 --> 249.76
talking we had a lot to catch up on

246.72 --> 251.84
so we went like in total

249.76 --> 253.2
with ball busters we were like talking

251.84 --> 256.239
for a total of five

253.2 --> 259.84
hours eventually it's like really

256.239 --> 262.32
until very late and then

259.84 --> 263.44
yeah just continue watching some more

262.32 --> 269.84
babylon 5

263.44 --> 269.84
after that and went to bed

275.52 --> 280.32
is that question to me arataza

280.479 --> 284.639
definitely not going to accept

282.24 --> 286.639
vaccination

284.639 --> 288.8
i've been hearing some crazy stories

286.639 --> 290.72
about that

288.8 --> 292.639
that our government is now trying to

290.72 --> 297.32000000000005
basically get that

292.639 --> 300.519
mandatory that's totally surreal

297.32 --> 300.519
[Music]

302.4 --> 313.28
but yeah i don't think they can

310.24 --> 316.40000000000003
i really don't think they can actually

313.28 --> 318.0
mandate it because i heard crazy stories

316.4 --> 320.63899999999995
like they're trying to mandate it

318.0 --> 322.639
just to get into stores now and that

320.639 --> 324.16
like you have to have a vaccine passport

322.639 --> 326.08
but it's all talk

324.16 --> 339.44
because there's just no way they can

326.08 --> 342.24
legally do that

339.44 --> 344.16
they will act if they can and the masses

342.24 --> 346.72
will follow but yeah but they can't

344.16 --> 349.03900000000004
really they can pretend

346.72 --> 350.84000000000003
but they can't actually do that because

349.039 --> 353.84
it's a gross violation of the

350.84 --> 353.84
constitution

354.8 --> 358.96000000000004
so they can't really do that

365.84 --> 372.4
yeah yeah yeah we know oh yeah yes

369.199 --> 374.16
i was brought up yesterday as well so i

372.4 --> 377.44
guess that's what you guys are

374.16 --> 378.96000000000004
that's what's in your mind now

377.44 --> 380.56
oh no we're going to be forced

378.96 --> 384.08
vaccinated oh it's all over

380.56 --> 385.919
they're going to do it anyway

384.08 --> 387.84
well you might have overlooked that

385.919 --> 395.84
technically they just can't

387.84 --> 395.84
really do that

401.759 --> 409.84000000000003
right it's all games

414.88 --> 418.08
right so i'm not gonna let it imprison

417.36 --> 420.319
me

418.08 --> 422.88
on a spiritual level because it's just

420.319 --> 426.69
not legal

422.88 --> 431.24
can't really do that they can pretend it

426.69 --> 431.24
[Music]

432.16 --> 435.28000000000003
my liberties will be taken well they can

434.4 --> 451.84
only take it

435.28 --> 451.84
if you give it to them

474.16 --> 477.28000000000003
well it seems they have a good chance

475.919 --> 479.68
well that's cute

477.28 --> 480.71999999999997
oh it's not cute that's a terrible way

479.68 --> 484.08
to say that

480.72 --> 484.56
or to joke about but yeah a lot of

484.08 --> 488.15999999999997
people

484.56 --> 490.24
might get dragged along in the games

488.16 --> 491.199
because on the short run they will try

490.24 --> 494.08
to like oh no

491.199 --> 495.84000000000003
no just make people businesses work

494.08 --> 498.24
along and then

495.84 --> 500.96
people will be barred but that's not

498.24 --> 505.199
going to last very long

500.96 --> 507.52
can't because it's just completely

505.199 --> 509.84000000000003
illegal

507.52 --> 510.639
and it will cause people to basically

509.84 --> 514.64
start

510.639 --> 514.64
yeah breaking with the system

516.64 --> 522.399
so this it's just not logical

520.08 --> 525.519
to assume that they have a chance to

522.399 --> 528.959
actually force everyone

525.519 --> 528.9590000000001
it's only people that choose

532.72 --> 536.72
and then yeah depending on what they're

534.64 --> 539.68
gonna do with the vaccines

536.72 --> 541.519
that's just it's gonna be bad news for

539.68 --> 543.8389999999999
them because it's already

541.519 --> 546.48
pretty well established that they it's

543.839 --> 549.519
not just a one-time thing

546.48 --> 549.839
they want to have people continually get

549.519 --> 552.72
that

549.839 --> 554.72
well how long do you think people are

552.72 --> 556.9590000000001
gonna survive that

554.72 --> 558.0
once it's just established that going

556.959 --> 562.0799999999999
along meat

558.0 --> 564.399
means you get into a pit of death that

562.08 --> 566.5600000000001
will slowly consume you

564.399 --> 567.839
yeah you think that people are just

566.56 --> 571.5999999999999
going to accept

567.839 --> 574.08
the whole situation as is like okay

571.6 --> 575.519
like oh if you want to be able to make

574.08 --> 578.5600000000001
it you are going to

575.519 --> 579.68
slowly die it's mandatory now that's it

578.56 --> 583.1999999999999
is

579.68 --> 583.1999999999999
absolutely unacceptable

587.2 --> 592.88
and yeah one way or the other like

590.24 --> 594.5600000000001
even the normies they're just going to

592.88 --> 598.32
be forced

594.56 --> 600.56
to rebel and not just freaking protest

598.32 --> 601.6800000000001
at some point yeah i warned everybody

600.56 --> 605.1199999999999
about this

601.68 --> 606.16
even two years ago like they are going

605.12 --> 609.839
to push you

606.16 --> 613.4399999999999
until you literally go in armed

609.839 --> 613.44
one way or the other

615.12 --> 621.2
it's like you don't have a choice really

618.32 --> 622.0790000000001
doesn't mean oh you have to move now i'm

621.2 --> 624.399
just saying no

622.079 --> 625.68
you don't have a choice eventually you

624.399 --> 627.36
will be forced to

625.68 --> 629.04
one way or the other whatever

627.36 --> 631.6800000000001
perspective you take on it

629.04 --> 633.36
because they are forcing the hand they

631.68 --> 636.64
are playing the card

633.36 --> 640.0
they think they can win and they're

636.64 --> 640.56
just forcing it that doesn't mean that

640.0 --> 647.839
they

640.56 --> 647.8389999999999
are winning

660.24 --> 665.76
hey twad wazzle military is heavily

664.079 --> 667.76
evolved well yeah that

665.76 --> 669.279
what does that even mean do you even

667.76 --> 671.4399999999999
know what that means

669.279 --> 673.36
look at all the different angles to the

671.44 --> 676.9590000000001
situation

673.36 --> 677.519
right everybody or a whole bunch of

676.959 --> 679.92
people

677.519 --> 681.36
believe one thing another bunch of

679.92 --> 685.8389999999999
people

681.36 --> 688.72
takes the same recipients

685.839 --> 690.8000000000001
and they believe something else about it

688.72 --> 691.279
and so everybody believes something else

690.8 --> 694.3199999999999
about

691.279 --> 697.76
everything that is involved right

694.32 --> 700.24
i'm just not i'm trying to not believe

697.76 --> 702.88
anything about anybody and just looking

700.24 --> 706.16
at this the inevitable choices that

702.88 --> 706.16
people are presented with

706.56 --> 711.92
i basically try to approach them as if

708.8 --> 715.04
they were in a quantum state

711.92 --> 718.16
and then instead of trying to

715.04 --> 719.76
pin it down where they are in a

718.16 --> 723.76
presupposition

719.76 --> 727.36
i basically try to apply fluid dynamics

723.76 --> 730.3199999999999
of choice making by

727.36 --> 731.76
identifying the choice that everybody

730.32 --> 735.36
will be presented with

731.76 --> 736.3199999999999
and then they must choose i find that a

735.36 --> 740.8000000000001
much much more

736.32 --> 740.8000000000001
reliable way to get an overview

742.839 --> 745.839
anyway

779.72 --> 784.72
undesirables blah blah this is all just

783.12 --> 787.839
squirting

784.72 --> 787.839
sorry guys but

796.639 --> 800.9590000000001
i think that people that are just

799.12 --> 801.279
talking about they're all getting caught

800.959 --> 805.5189999999999
up

801.279 --> 808.16
in these stories that people are making

805.519 --> 809.92
so you heard a story about how it's

808.16 --> 812.56
going to transpire

809.92 --> 815.12
that really appeals to you in some way

812.56 --> 818.2399999999999
and now that is your story

815.12 --> 818.24
that you are sharing

821.44 --> 828.0
how do you know that this specific

824.8 --> 830.7199999999999
way is the way it's going to happen

828.0 --> 833.199
have you not considered what i have

830.72 --> 836.1600000000001
presented

833.199 --> 836.16
what i have to say

839.519 --> 845.44
i think that people just

842.639 --> 847.839
kind of overestimate the dedication to

845.44 --> 850.1600000000001
nefarious plots

847.839 --> 851.2790000000001
that a whole bunch of people have i see

850.16 --> 855.199
it much more like

851.279 --> 856.959
it's a it's just a giant corporate

855.199 --> 858.8
lottery in a way to people

856.959 --> 861.199
and they're just trying to pick the

858.8 --> 863.76
winner within the options that they have

861.199 --> 866.24
left to them because of all the choices

863.76 --> 866.24
they made

868.88 --> 873.199
and with i guess a whole bunch of people

871.36 --> 875.92
the choices have become so narrow that

873.199 --> 879.92
they don't really have a choice anymore

875.92 --> 879.92
they've become caved in

882.0 --> 886.72
or that's not the right terminology they

884.48 --> 888.88
they become

886.72 --> 891.44
because of the choices they simply don't

888.88 --> 894.079
really have a choice anymore

891.44 --> 896.0790000000001
unless they choose to abandon all of it

894.079 --> 896.8389999999999
and all the consequences that come from

896.079 --> 899.8389999999999
that

896.839 --> 899.839
right

909.76 --> 915.6
let's see his conclusions desire was

913.12 --> 915.6
right up

917.199 --> 919.76
i don't know

921.17 --> 925.199
[Music]

923.199 --> 927.8389999999999
yeah well look when things are under

925.199 --> 927.8389999999999
pressure

928.079 --> 941.8389999999999
people in control always basically start

930.399 --> 941.839
looking for targets

947.12 --> 952.399
and this lady has passed what does that

952.839 --> 956.9590000000001
mean

955.12 --> 958.24
or you mean the nurse that took it and

956.959 --> 960.4799999999999
died

958.24 --> 961.839
yes yeah it's been bloody well

960.48 --> 964.9590000000001
established that it

961.839 --> 969.6800000000001
is not

964.959 --> 972.88
an actual supposedly

969.68 --> 975.92
benevolent vaccine which is

972.88 --> 977.92
potentially still possible

975.92 --> 980.8389999999999
you know like the entire premise of

977.92 --> 982.0
vaccination is highly dubious to me in

980.839 --> 985.12
general

982.0 --> 988.079
right somebody could potentially

985.12 --> 989.279
try to set up a benevolent vaccination

988.079 --> 991.92
for something

989.279 --> 992.8
well this definitely isn't it which

991.92 --> 996.079
makes it

992.8 --> 999.3599999999999
more blatant that there is a game

996.079 --> 1002.3199999999999
going on you don't do that nobody

999.36 --> 1003.6
ever does something like this and openly

1002.32 --> 1004.5600000000001
just says like yeah we're going to

1003.6 --> 1006.48
mandate it effort

1004.56 --> 1008.2399999999999
oh yeah and by the way it's one of the

1006.48 --> 1012.48
most lethal and dangerous

1008.24 --> 1015.36
[ __ ] with manipulation genetically

1012.48 --> 1017.279
and then actually do it tell me where in

1015.36 --> 1020.0790000000001
history

1017.279 --> 1021.12
any empire any kingdom has ever done

1020.079 --> 1025.12
anything like that

1021.12 --> 1028.959
and actually went with it

1025.12 --> 1032.559
none it has to be

1028.959 --> 1036.079
a game because nobody

1032.559 --> 1039.839
does this makes no sense

1036.079 --> 1039.839
for a straightforward plan

1044.48 --> 1056.4
hitler mussolini stalin oh really

1052.72 --> 1059.679
no but they would never do it like this

1056.4 --> 1061.76
they would just declare the enemy group

1059.679 --> 1063.039
or whatever and then start to deal with

1061.76 --> 1067.84
that

1063.039 --> 1067.84
that's different

1069.52 --> 1074.0
reality has consequences play stupid

1071.6 --> 1077.76
game win stupid prizes yeah yeah

1074.0 --> 1081.039
right well that's and that's actually

1077.76 --> 1085.84
a lot closer to the truth

1081.039 --> 1085.84
than to assume that it is all literal

1086.16 --> 1092.0
it all seems to me just like a huge

1088.24 --> 1094.08
confidence game pyramid scheme

1092.0 --> 1095.44
and everybody's just pulled along into

1094.08 --> 1098.24
it

1095.44 --> 1099.76
and some people do it for business

1098.24 --> 1101.52
opportunities and others

1099.76 --> 1103.6
get pulled into it because they are

1101.52 --> 1106.96
really believing it

1103.6 --> 1108.8799999999999
it's just kind of sad and has to be

1106.96 --> 1110.16
delusional up to a certain point that

1108.88 --> 1111.919
they go with things they don't

1110.16 --> 1112.3200000000002
understand because they're confronted

1111.919 --> 1116.0800000000002
with

1112.32 --> 1119.6789999999999
brutal evidence against

1116.08 --> 1123.039
its benevolent nature right

1119.679 --> 1125.44
so it's all just a game it has to be

1123.039 --> 1125.44
it's just

1127.44 --> 1131.76
it makes no sense to me in any other way

1133.52 --> 1138.6399999999999
they can't actually do that because then

1136.0 --> 1142.08
everything ends

1138.64 --> 1145.039
and not us day

1142.08 --> 1146.08
because when things become unacceptable

1145.039 --> 1149.12
the masses

1146.08 --> 1150.24
stand up and then you get that specific

1149.12 --> 1151.9189999999999
situation

1150.24 --> 1153.44
because they are always outnumbered so

1151.919 --> 1155.76
it's strategically

1153.44 --> 1157.3600000000001
it makes no sense if it was all literal

1155.76 --> 1161.28
so there must be

1157.36 --> 1161.28
playing a game a mind game

1162.96 --> 1179.8400000000001
and it can't be literal

1183.2 --> 1188.16
because that means like they're

1184.72 --> 1193.84
basically then committing suicide

1188.16 --> 1193.8400000000001
effectively they have to realize that

1197.76 --> 1207.84
hey robin stanley good to see you and i

1200.96 --> 1207.8400000000001
rams in stone

1208.62 --> 1211.7199999999998
[Music]

1221.12 --> 1229.6789999999999
as if they safe it's an issue of

1224.799 --> 1229.679
life when dealing with this matter uh

1232.84 --> 1238.32
sure

1235.28 --> 1240.32
famous castle i have no idea i don't

1238.32 --> 1242.8799999999999
know about any famous castles in the

1240.32 --> 1242.8799999999999
netherlands

1245.679 --> 1249.8400000000001
i really don't

1254.799 --> 1258.559
i just know that in the town where i

1257.2 --> 1263.8400000000001
grew up

1258.559 --> 1263.84
there was like a palace

1264.96 --> 1272.64
one of the palaces where like the

1268.72 --> 1274.96
old the princess and prince bernhard

1272.64 --> 1274.96
lived

1275.44 --> 1279.8400000000001
but that's not a castle it's just a huge

1277.76 --> 1282.72
house

1279.84 --> 1285.4399999999998
very big that's it i don't know about

1282.72 --> 1285.44
any castles

1286.799 --> 1290.08
this is more valuable to them than life

1288.84 --> 1293.6
just

1290.08 --> 1293.6
why would you think about that

1293.679 --> 1298.88
they're still bound by natural law

1299.039 --> 1305.6
all of that so whatever they

1302.08 --> 1306.8799999999999
use as a guide or a drive is not really

1305.6 --> 1309.28
relevant

1306.88 --> 1319.8400000000001
in the face of the mechanisms of how

1309.28 --> 1319.84
things really work

1323.679 --> 1333.8400000000001
god come on people it's why

1327.12 --> 1333.84
why are you talking about this

1334.48 --> 1337.44
it's so obvious

1337.6 --> 1341.76
like everybody's already talking about

1339.52 --> 1341.76
this

1342.0 --> 1349.039
why bring this up now it's it's 11

1346.0 --> 1352.96
months it's been talked about month one

1349.039 --> 1352.96
month two month three month four

1355.44 --> 1359.039
just repeating things that we already

1357.36 --> 1362.0
knew month one

1359.039 --> 1363.52
was already going on people were already

1362.0 --> 1367.6
spotting that

1363.52 --> 1371.36
i myself was already carefully echoing

1367.6 --> 1371.36
the key details to know

1372.84 --> 1375.84
uh

1386.84 --> 1389.84
right

1390.559 --> 1395.2
oh by the way uh big shout out to guns

1393.36 --> 1399.9189999999999
of nephron rmp

1395.2 --> 1404.32
caught him in chat yesterday was it

1399.919 --> 1404.3200000000002
over the flatters to mate premiere

1404.48 --> 1408.799
and apparently yeah he

1408.96 --> 1412.559
hasn't communicated as much because he's

1411.039 --> 1415.679
in the hospital

1412.559 --> 1417.44
because of an old injury from 20 years

1415.679 --> 1422.4
ago

1417.44 --> 1422.4
so i hope he recuperates quickly

1424.32 --> 1430.0
and yeah i did also get a paypal

1427.2 --> 1431.919
donation from him even

1430.0 --> 1433.44
yesterday night so thank you very much

1431.919 --> 1436.64
for that

1433.44 --> 1436.64
guns have never yeah

1438.0 --> 1441.52
definitely prayers to him

1441.919 --> 1445.919
but yeah i was just very glad to hear

1444.08 --> 1447.9189999999999
that well they're glad

1445.919 --> 1450.5590000000002
that it was that he wasn't like really

1447.919 --> 1452.7990000000002
pissed off or anything

1450.559 --> 1452.799
because

1453.679 --> 1460.72
yeah i'm sure he'll be he'll be fine

1458.96 --> 1464.0
yeah he apparently had a really bad

1460.72 --> 1466.72
accident like 20 years ago and

1464.0 --> 1468.159
yeah when you get that sort of injury

1466.72 --> 1470.24
you're bound to have like

1468.159 --> 1471.679
periods where it's going to bother you

1470.24 --> 1473.679
again and

1471.679 --> 1476.0800000000002
don't know the exact situation you might

1473.679 --> 1476.96
have to go through repeated surgery

1476.08 --> 1480.559
because of that

1476.96 --> 1480.559
something but

1481.6 --> 1487.76
he was already walking about he said

1485.279 --> 1489.6
so or wait no he was still recuperating

1487.76 --> 1493.12
in his bed but anyway

1489.6 --> 1494.9599999999998
i hope he will be fine and

1493.12 --> 1497.12
hope to see him again soon and thanks

1494.96 --> 1498.64
again for the yeah the donation

1497.12 --> 1500.6399999999999
your continuous support has really

1498.64 --> 1503.8400000000001
helped me to

1500.64 --> 1503.8400000000001
basically get around

1504.159 --> 1515.8400000000001
so thank you so much and hope to see you

1507.12 --> 1515.84
again soon

1518.0 --> 1521.279
what are you talking about

1525.279 --> 1543.84
it's very naive what is

1561.44 --> 1564.559
but i'm just curious what you were

1563.36 --> 1568.4799999999998
talking about

1564.559 --> 1572.8799999999999
or because i've been saying things

1568.48 --> 1572.88
it's kind of hard to pinpoint a response

1577.52 --> 1585.84
like to what you were responding or if

1580.24 --> 1585.84
it was even to me i don't know

1590.08 --> 1593.4399999999998
curbside delivery

1596.84 --> 1599.84
ah

1601.039 --> 1605.76
yeah it's good to hear that things are

1604.0 --> 1609.36
running

1605.76 --> 1613.84
well over there at roman stanley

1609.36 --> 1613.84
at your new job

1622.72 --> 1630.48
right anyway uh

1626.48 --> 1630.48
man yesterday ball busters

1630.72 --> 1635.279
it's all about jam panda and all that i

1633.76 --> 1637.039
haven't heard from that guy in a long

1635.279 --> 1640.24
time because every time i do

1637.039 --> 1643.76
he's always just

1640.24 --> 1646.08
going into baller opera mode does that

1643.76 --> 1649.76
make any sense that i would call it that

1646.08 --> 1649.76
like jam panda gets all

1651.2 --> 1658.24
like in opera mode almost start

1654.48 --> 1661.679
doing his peacock dances and his

1658.24 --> 1664.3990000000001
story amazing

1661.679 --> 1664.799
things it's just but it makes no sense

1664.399 --> 1668.8799999999999
he's

1664.799 --> 1671.52
always just it like improvising in the

1668.88 --> 1671.919
moment without any logical consistency

1671.52 --> 1676.1589999999999
for

1671.919 --> 1677.76
any like the angle of approach is

1676.159 --> 1680.3200000000002
constantly fluid

1677.76 --> 1680.96
he doesn't have a foundational approach

1680.32 --> 1683.76
it

1680.96 --> 1685.2
doesn't have a solid argument if you

1683.76 --> 1688.64
will

1685.2 --> 1690.3990000000001
that really stood out to me and then i

1688.64 --> 1691.76
remembered why i don't like to listen to

1690.399 --> 1694.559
him because he gets so

1691.76 --> 1696.799
incredibly arrogant when he does that

1694.559 --> 1699.36
when he does his peacock [ __ ] thing his

1696.799 --> 1700.08
opera when he goes into baller opera

1699.36 --> 1704.0
mode

1700.08 --> 1704.6399999999999
right he gets so arrogant like he really

1704.0 --> 1707.919
starts to

1704.64 --> 1709.44
bully you from an extremely naive but

1707.919 --> 1713.8400000000001
dominant position it's

1709.44 --> 1716.559
super annoying very very annoying

1713.84 --> 1717.12
this is so yeah that's kind of why i

1716.559 --> 1719.36
don't

1717.12 --> 1721.279
like to listen to him like when he is

1719.36 --> 1724.24
somewhere he always does that and it and

1721.279 --> 1739.84
it's just very annoying

1724.24 --> 1739.84
what's the area

1743.52 --> 1747.039
he knows he's dead in the water

1750.84 --> 1754.8799999999999
probably

1752.66 --> 1759.1200000000001
[Music]

1754.88 --> 1759.1200000000001
like the blue lady in the fifth element

1760.54 --> 1763.6299999999999
[Music]

1764.84 --> 1770.08
well hmm that's funny

1767.76 --> 1770.08
maybe

1772.399 --> 1776.559
i i kind of vaguely see what you mean

1775.279 --> 1779.039
with that

1776.559 --> 1780.6399999999999
that that creature was also weird and

1779.039 --> 1784.0
sort of arrogant and then it

1780.64 --> 1787.5200000000002
sacrificed itself and this was really

1784.0 --> 1787.52
weird premise

1788.32 --> 1792.6399999999999
like within the planet like her death

1790.88 --> 1796.159
was designated

1792.64 --> 1800.159
because of just yeah the implications

1796.159 --> 1803.44
literally like the key parts

1800.159 --> 1805.679
being inside of her cannot be removed

1803.44 --> 1807.76
safely like that that's like a really

1805.679 --> 1811.52
insane implication

1807.76 --> 1813.76
but it was all just like well maybe that

1811.52 --> 1816.799
is a good comparison

1813.76 --> 1819.679
then like jam panda is

1816.799 --> 1821.12
it's like he's being all arrogant but

1819.679 --> 1824.48
like

1821.12 --> 1827.039
he should know by his approach that it's

1824.48 --> 1829.76
he's not going to get out of it a

1827.039 --> 1829.76
triumphant

1831.36 --> 1837.12
that's a funny comparison there

1834.84 --> 1839.279
tomorrow welcome to the stream by the

1837.12 --> 1839.279
way

1840.559 --> 1843.84
poor gem marked here

1844.399 --> 1848.84
well there's a lot of globe martiers

1846.399 --> 1851.36
it's just

1848.84 --> 1854.4599999999998
pointless

1851.36 --> 1854.4599999999998
[Music]

1857.519 --> 1862.32
baller opera would be very entertaining

1859.6 --> 1865.76
well you know what robin stanley i bet

1862.32 --> 1868.799
in the olden days there were literally

1865.76 --> 1871.2
like baller operas where the

1868.799 --> 1875.12
singers would be representative for

1871.2 --> 1875.1200000000001
example of the planets or something

1875.2 --> 1879.519
and they would yeah i bet they at some

1878.559 --> 1882.32
point probably did

1879.519 --> 1883.36
these sort of things or maybe they had

1882.32 --> 1885.72
to hide

1883.36 --> 1887.9189999999999
their real roles but they would put

1885.72 --> 1889.679
heliocentrism [ __ ] into pretty much

1887.919 --> 1891.1200000000001
anything they could get their hands on

1889.679 --> 1892.88
and they had their hands on a lot of

1891.12 --> 1897.84
things

1892.88 --> 1897.8400000000001
so there might be baller operas for real

1898.64 --> 1907.8400000000001
it's just a little bit more covert

1918.0 --> 1924.96
in the main pixels maybe

1921.12 --> 1924.9599999999998
neo had to not fight smith

1929.519 --> 1933.519
well that was kind of a little bit of a

1931.76 --> 1936.96
conundrum there

1933.519 --> 1939.1200000000001
because he had to well only to

1936.96 --> 1941.2
move on to the next step but he could

1939.12 --> 1945.12
technically have gone on forever or

1941.2 --> 1945.1200000000001
simply not returned to the matrix

1945.44 --> 1953.6000000000001
but he made that deal for

1948.559 --> 1953.6
peace with the machines

1958.48 --> 1962.24
which is very odd if it was actually as

1961.36 --> 1965.36
is

1962.24 --> 1967.679
unless the machines were like unless he

1965.36 --> 1969.76
was simply a chain in a program and the

1967.679 --> 1972.96
machines

1969.76 --> 1976.0
had a long-term invested interest

1972.96 --> 1979.2
in the survival of mankind under the

1976.0 --> 1979.2
program's conditions

1982.08 --> 1988.84
and with the program i mean like the one

1985.84 --> 1991.84
cycles that program the program of the

1988.84 --> 1991.84
architect

1998.02 --> 2001.079
[Music]

2004.88 --> 2009.279
more like marriage figaro lighthearted

2010.72 --> 2013.919
all right yeah robin stanley by the way

2013.2 --> 2016.799
i am not

2013.919 --> 2018.96
i've never really been a big opera fan i

2016.799 --> 2021.44
like the idea that they're out there

2018.96 --> 2023.76
but i'm way too impatient to sit through

2021.44 --> 2032.0800000000002
an actual upright those are just always

2023.76 --> 2035.679
too long

2032.08 --> 2038.96
but i kind of appreciate that they exist

2035.679 --> 2043.3600000000001
and the history of it all and also just

2038.96 --> 2043.3600000000001
the looks i do like the theatric part

2043.519 --> 2048.159
and there's always something special

2045.2 --> 2048.159
about actually

2048.96 --> 2053.52
like having a more face to face

2050.8 --> 2056.8
situation like that

2053.52 --> 2061.839
be that is great for beginners this is

2056.8 --> 2061.8390000000004
i wouldn't know

2064.56 --> 2068.0
i think that i i went to an opera like

2067.119 --> 2071.359
twice

2068.0 --> 2074.159
with my parents when i was very young

2071.359 --> 2076.0789999999997
but yeah i was young and what would

2074.159 --> 2077.04
happen is simply i would just start

2076.079 --> 2079.3590000000004
dreaming

2077.04 --> 2082.56
with the opera music in the background

2079.359 --> 2082.56
and just get these

2082.72 --> 2089.919
heavy probably pineal gland driven

2087.599 --> 2090.8790000000004
dreams with the music in the backdrop

2089.919 --> 2094.56
because it just took

2090.879 --> 2097.2799999999997
way too long to just listen to the music

2094.56 --> 2099.2799999999997
it wasn't active enough for my brain so

2097.28 --> 2103.2000000000003
it just

2099.28 --> 2106.4
started to do what i always do

2103.2 --> 2107.04
get introspective and in at first there

2106.4 --> 2110.2400000000002
was always

2107.04 --> 2114.2
express with just heavy dreaming

2110.24 --> 2117.4399999999996
trying to find the ethereal

2114.2 --> 2119.359
implications and knowledge of everything

2117.44 --> 2121.44
that i could not attain yet but did

2119.359 --> 2124.72
realize was there

2121.44 --> 2128.079
so to me it was just a giant mystical

2124.72 --> 2130.16
lagos playset back then

2128.079 --> 2132.5600000000004
and that expressed itself even visually

2130.16 --> 2135.04
in my dreams

2132.56 --> 2135.7599999999998
like with lagos i realized pretty early

2135.04 --> 2138.88
on like

2135.76 --> 2140.48
yeah everything is structured

2138.88 --> 2142.48
so that means there are things that i

2140.48 --> 2143.28
will already see the structures of but i

2142.48 --> 2146.16
will not

2143.28 --> 2147.6800000000003
understand it just yet i might see

2146.16 --> 2149.5989999999997
superficially what it means but i

2147.68 --> 2154.16
already know it's going to be so

2149.599 --> 2156.48
fast and i just can't handle it yet

2154.16 --> 2159.839
all right hey gunshot never runner p

2156.48 --> 2159.839
good to see you in chat

2161.2 --> 2164.24
just watching the show

2166.24 --> 2170.3999999999996
alright yeah thanks again for the paypal

2169.68 --> 2173.7599999999998
donation

2170.4 --> 2177.2000000000003
i did receive it it was perfect

2173.76 --> 2179.5200000000004
great timing again uh

2177.2 --> 2180.8799999999997
but yeah first and foremost i'm just

2179.52 --> 2183.04
glad you're all right

2180.88 --> 2183.92
because i was a bit worried that i

2183.04 --> 2187.04
hadn't heard

2183.92 --> 2190.32
from you or seen you around in a while

2187.04 --> 2190.32
after that last comment

2192.8 --> 2201.8390000000004
you like tyler perry god no

2197.359 --> 2201.839
please no

2228.079 --> 2234.079
oh god don't do that i

2231.2 --> 2236.7999999999997
really don't like tyler perry like

2234.079 --> 2236.8
really done

2238.4 --> 2242.96
but i do understand why probably some

2240.88 --> 2245.839
people think he's funny

2242.96 --> 2245.839
i just don't

2250.24 --> 2253.2799999999997
like the only thing that's funny about

2252.079 --> 2255.92
him is how

2253.28 --> 2257.0400000000004
annoying he can be to others and then i

2255.92 --> 2260.64
get like a

2257.04 --> 2264.079
sort of grabble or chuckle out of that

2260.64 --> 2271.839
this is not a good

2264.079 --> 2271.8390000000004
good thing

2282.839 --> 2285.839
so

2302.88 --> 2315.76
right so

2312.56 --> 2318.0
we're talking about operas i jump in

2315.76 --> 2318.0
there

2323.839 --> 2328.0789999999997
some people don't like shakespeare it's

2326.16 --> 2331.68
all good whatever inspires you

2328.079 --> 2335.3590000000004
well you know traditional shakespeare

2331.68 --> 2338.839
i do kind of think it's a bit lame but

2335.359 --> 2342.88
shakespeare plays do address

2338.839 --> 2346.32
very interesting like

2342.88 --> 2349.359
esoteric detailed things like

2346.32 --> 2351.599
it is it is very special

2349.359 --> 2353.839
in different ways also in weird graveler

2351.599 --> 2356.56
ways

2353.839 --> 2358.0
i do appreciate that it's just that the

2356.56 --> 2362.0789999999997
literal plays are

2358.0 --> 2362.079
like way too long-winded and [ __ ]

2362.56 --> 2366.16
but there's very interesting things

2364.8 --> 2369.28
addressed

2366.16 --> 2383.839
and also the way with words

2369.28 --> 2383.8390000000004
isolated is interesting

2394.839 --> 2400.24
so

2396.16 --> 2400.24
sensory overload right

2400.4 --> 2403.92
yeah well that's with me too it's just

2403.2 --> 2405.9199999999996
like

2403.92 --> 2410.2400000000002
i just start to dream because of it

2405.92 --> 2412.88
because of the impressiveness

2410.24 --> 2414.319
but it's not like it captivated me like

2412.88 --> 2419.92
oh i wanted to see

2414.319 --> 2419.92
that constantly because it just took too

2422.839 --> 2426.48
long literary

2424.72 --> 2428.319
shakespeare is a literary genius well

2426.48 --> 2431.92
shakespeare is not a person

2428.319 --> 2435.44
first off it's a group of writers

2431.92 --> 2437.52
but yes they were very

2435.44 --> 2438.56
creative with the english language they

2437.52 --> 2441.839
were desperate

2438.56 --> 2441.839
like definitely

2443.04 --> 2453.839
linguistic masters

2466.72 --> 2473.9199999999996
this does influence society

2470.0 --> 2473.92
well how has it influenced society

2478.839 --> 2481.839
though

2495.359 --> 2509.839
right biblical theme plays that's true

2515.599 --> 2520.56
i don't know it's it's tough look i'm

2518.24 --> 2522.8799999999997
not a shakespeare expert on by any

2520.56 --> 2526.16
measure right

2522.88 --> 2528.6400000000003
but i always just had this rough feeling

2526.16 --> 2529.68
that like [ __ ] the writers from

2528.64 --> 2535.1189999999997
shakespeare

2529.68 --> 2535.1189999999997
were like the liberals from that time

2535.599 --> 2542.6400000000003
which were much better than

2539.119 --> 2545.839
what they're now but like they were like

2542.64 --> 2549.04
classical liberals

2545.839 --> 2549.52
and expert in their field and that is

2549.04 --> 2553.52
also

2549.52 --> 2553.52
probably why it has echoed on

2553.599 --> 2557.599
because it is like oh look at the good

2555.599 --> 2561.44
example of a good liberal that's

2557.599 --> 2561.92
us right like that while the current

2561.44 --> 2563.68
time

2561.92 --> 2565.839
liberals are just corrupting all over

2563.68 --> 2565.839
the place

2567.44 --> 2571.44
it's like a good memory that they like

2569.2 --> 2579.839
to keep in there

2571.44 --> 2579.839
i don't know

2585.52 --> 2593.839
all right

2598.12 --> 2601.21
[Music]

2603.59 --> 2612.1600000000003
[Music]

2610.4 --> 2615.839
but you do get what i mean right robin

2612.16 --> 2620.3999999999996
stanley they were really the liberals of

2615.839 --> 2623.2799999999997
of that age

2620.4 --> 2625.04
and i bet that when their place first

2623.28 --> 2627.28
came on

2625.04 --> 2630.0
there was still plenty of people that

2627.28 --> 2630.0
didn't like it

2631.119 --> 2638.0
because it would probably

2634.48 --> 2642.079
like bring out vulnerabilities or

2638.0 --> 2649.839
whatever at the higher class

2642.079 --> 2649.8390000000004
be extremely indecent in certain places

2660.839 --> 2663.839
hmm

2667.44 --> 2678.96
what is this

2676.4 --> 2678.96
exactly

2680.16 --> 2684.3999999999996
and look even that's the weird thing

2686.64 --> 2693.2
like it's even known and praised

2690.64 --> 2694.319
like i remember for example star trek's

2693.2 --> 2696.3999999999996
next generation

2694.319 --> 2699.04
had a lot of references to shakespeare

2696.4 --> 2700.88
and that they talked about it and

2699.04 --> 2702.8
like i think i remembered even a

2700.88 --> 2704.96
shakespeare themed episode

2702.8 --> 2706.319
that was kind of the thing like oh

2704.96 --> 2708.0
they're the liberals they have to go

2706.319 --> 2711.44
against the conservatives

2708.0 --> 2711.44
it's that emphasized

2712.4 --> 2716.8
so there is a vested interest in people

2715.359 --> 2719.839
thinking of them

2716.8 --> 2721.28
as being the liberals of their age to

2719.839 --> 2725.119
reflect

2721.28 --> 2728.079
that pure form of liberalism if you will

2725.119 --> 2728.4
it's very tough to actually realize what

2728.079 --> 2730.7200000000003
it

2728.4 --> 2732.4
actually is even in that time because

2730.72 --> 2735.68
we're not longer in that time

2732.4 --> 2736.4
we can reflect upon it now but they're

2735.68 --> 2740.319
using it

2736.4 --> 2742.1600000000003
as as a bit of a cloak and they do that

2740.319 --> 2742.96
with a lot of things in the past say

2742.16 --> 2745.839
like oh they

2742.96 --> 2746.48
think like us that means we're good

2745.839 --> 2749.839
because

2746.48 --> 2753.2
we associate with them you get it right

2749.839 --> 2753.2
and that's their mantle

2754.16 --> 2757.2799999999997
that's what it's now

2757.599 --> 2764.6400000000003
it's a cloak of of the people

2761.04 --> 2768.079
using the same principles in the past to

2764.64 --> 2771.1189999999997
attain like yeah status

2768.079 --> 2772.88
and trust trust that you follow those

2771.119 --> 2774.88
mechanisms when it's absolutely

2772.88 --> 2777.44
guaranteed that you want

2774.88 --> 2789.839
those people that do that but people

2777.44 --> 2789.839
fall for it anyway

2790.96 --> 2793.92
no globe shark

2795.28 --> 2803.8390000000004
that's ridiculous

2805.599 --> 2814.2400000000002
somebody wants to end the conversation

2809.28 --> 2814.2400000000002
about shakespeare and liberalism

2815.68 --> 2821.2799999999997
that tone what no

2818.96 --> 2823.119
just it's just squirting look when they

2821.28 --> 2824.88
come in oh i'm going to be blocked right

2823.119 --> 2828.48
that means no you're not going to be

2824.88 --> 2830.88
blocked you're just going to be ignored

2828.48 --> 2832.48
because you're not controversial just

2830.88 --> 2833.839
because you believe in a globe you're

2832.48 --> 2836.72
just dumb

2833.839 --> 2838.88
and yeah out there in the world when

2836.72 --> 2839.5989999999997
somebody proves themselves to be really

2838.88 --> 2841.599
dumb

2839.599 --> 2843.3590000000004
you don't kick them out either you just

2841.599 --> 2846.4
ignore them

2843.359 --> 2846.4
i have to learn that

2851.0 --> 2854.219
[Music]

2856.72 --> 2860.319
yeah that's really cute

2861.28 --> 2863.92
laugh it up

2866.48 --> 2870.839
all right well if you want to block him

2868.48 --> 2873.839
go ahead i don't really care

2870.839 --> 2873.839
just

2880.0 --> 2885.599
just a desperate guy trying to find some

2884.0 --> 2888.48
relevance

2885.599 --> 2888.96
in his in the defense of his belief

2888.48 --> 2893.839
don't

2888.96 --> 2897.52
yeah censorship is a sign of deceit

2893.839 --> 2901.839
or order so that's

2897.52 --> 2901.839
that's ridiculous

2902.4 --> 2907.52
and by the way officially censorship is

2904.96 --> 2907.52
technically

2912.839 --> 2915.839
government-based

2918.96 --> 2926.0
hey steve oh foster it's entertaining

2922.0 --> 2926.0
i'm so glad you're entertained

2926.88 --> 2934.1600000000003
censorship is flat earth that's [ __ ]

2930.559 --> 2934.1600000000003
that's absolutely ridiculous

2935.68 --> 2940.48
like that doesn't even make any sense as

2938.8 --> 2957.8390000000004
a sentence

2940.48 --> 2957.839
you're losing it the globe shark

2959.28 --> 2963.52
right so how many more times are you

2961.68 --> 2966.16
going to say oh i'm being censored i'm

2963.52 --> 2969.2
being censored oh you block everybody

2966.16 --> 2971.2
i'm not doing it so why do you keep on

2969.2 --> 2971.5989999999997
saying it you would not be able to say

2971.2 --> 2974.0789999999997
that

2971.599 --> 2975.119
in my chat if i were actually doing it

2974.079 --> 2978.079
so you're just

2975.119 --> 2981.52
proving you're stupid and are spouting

2978.079 --> 2981.52
out paradoxical claims

2983.599 --> 2999.839
i'm being said what

3013.92 --> 3017.839
you're not important enough to get

3015.68 --> 3027.839
censored

3017.839 --> 3027.839
this is

3035.839 --> 3040.7999999999997
no you won't be blocked unless you just

3038.319 --> 3043.119
spam too much if you're gonna get

3040.8 --> 3044.48
in the way or you're just going over

3043.119 --> 3047.2000000000003
borders

3044.48 --> 3048.16
or you shouldn't then i'll kick you so

3047.2 --> 3054.319
yeah you can

3048.16 --> 3057.7599999999998
if you insist on getting kicked

3054.319 --> 3061.04
yeah 50 degrees drift of what

3057.76 --> 3065.599
of light light

3061.04 --> 3071.04
conjured in in an apparatus

3065.599 --> 3071.04
earth oh so how did you establish that

3071.599 --> 3079.52
because as far as i'm concerned the

3075.52 --> 3083.04
ring laser gyroscope or whatever it was

3079.52 --> 3084.64
it was not placed at the north pole or

3083.04 --> 3087.599
the south pole

3084.64 --> 3089.1189999999997
it was just somewhere in between the

3087.599 --> 3092.96
equator and the north pole

3089.119 --> 3096.4
in america yet the rotation

3092.96 --> 3099.76
was perfectly perpendicular

3096.4 --> 3101.28
to the surface at that spot so how does

3099.76 --> 3103.8390000000004
that

3101.28 --> 3105.28
light based motion because physical

3103.839 --> 3108.5589999999997
gyroscopes didn't

3105.28 --> 3110.2400000000002
do that right you see kind of overlooked

3108.559 --> 3113.2000000000003
that like oh that thing did it

3110.24 --> 3113.9199999999996
yeah but the other one did not now

3113.2 --> 3116.64
unless you

3113.92 --> 3117.6800000000003
completely don't understand how physics

3116.64 --> 3120.72
work at all

3117.68 --> 3121.44
and science and even basic mechanics and

3120.72 --> 3123.5989999999997
logic

3121.44 --> 3125.359
then you might actually think you got

3123.599 --> 3128.48
something there with the 15 degrees

3125.359 --> 3130.64
hours drift of one apparatus

3128.48 --> 3132.8
but you're just overlooking even how

3130.64 --> 3135.44
it's supposed to be rotating

3132.8 --> 3135.8390000000004
if the earth was a globe it didn't do

3135.44 --> 3138.4
that

3135.839 --> 3139.839
at all and the other devices did not

3138.4 --> 3142.88
rotate either

3139.839 --> 3146.0789999999997
at all so yeah

3142.88 --> 3146.079
this makes no sense

3147.52 --> 3153.839
okay now you're just spamming stop it

3159.04 --> 3161.839
that's just dumb

3163.359 --> 3167.2
how are you going to prove curvature if

3165.2 --> 3169.52
nobody even claims

3167.2 --> 3172.0
the horizon is the leading edge of a

3169.52 --> 3172.0
sphere

3172.72 --> 3176.16
nobody claims that remember the mage

3175.599 --> 3180.0
balloon

3176.16 --> 3182.0789999999997
and all that remember that

3180.0 --> 3183.92
that nobody actually claims that the

3182.079 --> 3186.88
horizon is

3183.92 --> 3187.76
the edge of a sphere that it's a

3186.88 --> 3190.1600000000003
geometrically

3187.76 --> 3191.3590000000004
physical location and then it's

3190.16 --> 3194.96
reasserted again

3191.359 --> 3198.5589999999997
so it's completely pointless

3194.96 --> 3201.92
you can't prove curvature

3198.559 --> 3204.3190000000004
if you don't assume the horizon is not

3201.92 --> 3209.839
the leading edge of the sphere

3204.319 --> 3209.839
that you are claiming is there

3228.48 --> 3232.8
denying that i addressed it

3233.359 --> 3236.96
are you just a spam troll you don't seem

3236.16 --> 3240.16
to be

3236.96 --> 3242.88
actually listening to anything

3240.16 --> 3244.5589999999997
you're just spouting from a script

3242.88 --> 3245.119
because you're not responding to the

3244.559 --> 3247.3590000000004
people

3245.119 --> 3248.88
i don't know in the hangout me literally

3247.359 --> 3251.119
addressing what you're saying

3248.88 --> 3253.119
in detail you're not responding to that

3251.119 --> 3255.2000000000003
at all

3253.119 --> 3257.92
so maybe i should just ban you because

3255.2 --> 3257.9199999999996
it's just lame

3258.72 --> 3262.64
like as a glober and glovers are allowed

3261.359 --> 3264.24
in my chat you are not

3262.64 --> 3267.359
interesting because you're not

3264.24 --> 3269.4399999999996
responding to anything

3267.359 --> 3270.48
yeah okay well it's time to [ __ ] off

3269.44 --> 3272.96
then goodbye

3270.48 --> 3274.96
goodbye [ __ ] and your socks are

3272.96 --> 3276.96
banned too so you can do that all day

3274.96 --> 3278.7200000000003
long i'll ban everything

3276.96 --> 3280.079
don't worry because you're not

3278.72 --> 3283.2799999999997
responding to anything

3280.079 --> 3284.319
it's a waste of my time and my chat

3283.28 --> 3285.8390000000004
space

3284.319 --> 3287.52
because there's other people in chat

3285.839 --> 3289.04
that do actually want to have a

3287.52 --> 3293.839
conversation and not just

3289.04 --> 3293.839
spout from a script

3296.53 --> 3307.179
[Music]

3314.079 --> 3319.76
yeah it's just spamming

3317.839 --> 3321.599
i addressed everything he said

3319.76 --> 3324.079
everything and just did not

3321.599 --> 3324.079
respond

3324.88 --> 3328.799
did not give even a sign that he was

3326.64 --> 3330.48
listening so it seemed almost like he

3328.799 --> 3334.079
did not actually even

3330.48 --> 3335.839
listen to the hangout itself had no clue

3334.079 --> 3339.119
what was said he was just

3335.839 --> 3341.839
in the chat doing things in his chat not

3339.119 --> 3344.559
actually knowing what was going on

3341.839 --> 3345.92
except for what other people beside him

3344.559 --> 3349.6800000000003
in the chat say

3345.92 --> 3350.799
you see now if you do that and you don't

3349.68 --> 3355.359
listen

3350.799 --> 3358.079
to me the host the speaker of the show

3355.359 --> 3359.68
if you if i find proof of that i will

3358.079 --> 3363.52
absolutely ban you

3359.68 --> 3365.04
i will absolutely ban every single sock

3363.52 --> 3367.28
you make

3365.04 --> 3368.48
can do this all day i don't care i can

3367.28 --> 3371.92
do this for another

3368.48 --> 3377.28
hour every freaking sucky

3371.92 --> 3379.119
shitty thing you make

3377.28 --> 3380.799
because i don't care about people

3379.119 --> 3384.1600000000003
complaining about censorship

3380.799 --> 3388.4
you just instantly ban

3384.16 --> 3388.3999999999996
there is plenty of ballers here in my

3388.839 --> 3393.2
chat

3390.559 --> 3397.0400000000004
right that can behave respectfully and

3393.2 --> 3399.52
have a conversation give their opinions

3397.04 --> 3401.68
and they're not banned they only get

3399.52 --> 3403.92
banned when they start to like

3401.68 --> 3405.839
really get out of line to be extremely

3403.92 --> 3408.16
disrespectful

3405.839 --> 3409.119
so just this claim of censorship is just

3408.16 --> 3411.92
really stupid

3409.119 --> 3415.76
and lame and a straw man because you're

3411.92 --> 3415.76
not listening to anything that's said

3416.839 --> 3419.839
here

3421.52 --> 3433.839
android keyboard okay a voice

3472.839 --> 3479.04
foreign but

3476.079 --> 3480.2400000000002
all of that you know every time in the

3479.04 --> 3484.079
globe

3480.24 --> 3487.52
conception of why it is the way it is

3484.079 --> 3490.48
it always comes down to that

3487.52 --> 3492.559
they kind of pull in einstein's

3490.48 --> 3495.92
relativity theory

3492.559 --> 3498.079
to help like they repeat his

3495.92 --> 3499.119
process of the relativity effect even

3498.079 --> 3502.2400000000002
though it's

3499.119 --> 3504.67
it's so bunk in many ways they

3502.24 --> 3506.24
pull it in because it just makes you

3504.67 --> 3509.839
[Music]

3506.24 --> 3512.799
able to re relativate

3509.839 --> 3513.359
things and basically start to discard

3512.799 --> 3515.68
data

3513.359 --> 3516.4
as in like oh this thing is actually

3515.68 --> 3519.7599999999998
falling

3516.4 --> 3521.76
because it's all relative so despite

3519.76 --> 3523.599
relativity theory not having any

3521.76 --> 3527.0
relevance really

3523.599 --> 3530.799
anymore it's popularly

3527.0 --> 3534.319
utilized because

3530.799 --> 3537.359
it helps you to ignore details

3534.319 --> 3540.24
critical details in the conception

3537.359 --> 3542.24
of the globe that's why they pull it in

3540.24 --> 3544.799
not because of its actual

3542.24 --> 3545.4399999999996
scientific relevance to anything but

3544.799 --> 3548.799
because

3545.44 --> 3551.76
it is so easy

3548.799 --> 3552.319
to use it to forget about important

3551.76 --> 3555.44
facts

3552.319 --> 3559.839
that are inconvenient

3555.44 --> 3559.839
that's why they do that

3566.72 --> 3569.839
denying the globe that you saw something

3569.28 --> 3574.079
through it

3569.839 --> 3574.0789999999997
through a scope that's brilliant

3578.319 --> 3583.599
so you saw some weird shaped lights

3585.52 --> 3593.28
in the sky through a big lens

3589.599 --> 3593.28
and now you think the earth is a globe

3593.44 --> 3603.119
that's quite a quite a jump

3597.76 --> 3603.119
to make this is very cute

3613.68 --> 3628.72
seems a little farfetched

3616.96 --> 3632.079
oh all the other evidences right

3628.72 --> 3635.52
that's very special

3632.079 --> 3635.52
all these other evidences

3635.92 --> 3640.0
i take it that all these other evidences

3638.88 --> 3642.079
very gladly

3640.0 --> 3643.68
ignore every single housekeeping

3642.079 --> 3644.6400000000003
question that's typically asked at the

3643.68 --> 3649.04
flat earth debate

3644.64 --> 3652.48
for several years on a daily basis now

3649.04 --> 3655.68
several parts of the day

3652.48 --> 3656.96
where it is being broadcast either live

3655.68 --> 3659.52
or in premieres

3656.96 --> 3662.079
i take it that those other endless

3659.52 --> 3664.4
amounts of evidences for the globe

3662.079 --> 3671.8390000000004
do not take in those housekeeping

3664.4 --> 3671.839
questions into account do they

3673.76 --> 3678.7990000000004
oh zzz well if einstein said that

3676.72 --> 3680.0789999999997
general relativity and ether cannot

3678.799 --> 3682.599
coexist

3680.079 --> 3684.2400000000002
and general relativity is bunk then that

3682.599 --> 3687.3590000000004
automatically means

3684.24 --> 3688.319
that ether must be real because einstein

3687.359 --> 3691.839
said it

3688.319 --> 3695.7599999999998
right right that's logical that's not a

3691.839 --> 3699.839
false dichotomy conclusion at all

3695.76 --> 3699.8390000000004
this is come on

3702.33 --> 3706.34
[Music]

3706.96 --> 3714.48
wow never had so much

3710.96 --> 3717.359
baller squirting in my chat for months

3714.48 --> 3717.359
or maybe years

3718.58 --> 3724.0789999999997
[Music]

3721.28 --> 3725.3590000000004
einstein is a genius well einstein is

3724.079 --> 3729.76
dead

3725.359 --> 3733.2799999999997
also he married his cousin twice

3729.76 --> 3733.28
right uh

3733.359 --> 3739.7599999999998
and he was a very much hated

3736.559 --> 3740.0
pseudo scientist in physics circle did

3739.76 --> 3742.3190000000004
you

3740.0 --> 3743.039
not know there's been like news articles

3742.319 --> 3747.2
even

3743.039 --> 3747.2000000000003
petitions against him

3748.0 --> 3752.24
from the scientific community because he

3750.319 --> 3754.88
was a pseudo-scientist

3752.24 --> 3757.1189999999997
speculator that was just constantly

3754.88 --> 3757.92
screwing around with conceptual mediums

3757.119 --> 3762.0
and math

3757.92 --> 3762.319
and just because it structurally worked

3762.0 --> 3765.44
out

3762.319 --> 3768.16
he just assumed that it was real and it

3765.44 --> 3771.2000000000003
was being popularized

3768.16 --> 3774.8799999999997
yeah no einstein

3771.2 --> 3776.04
was interesting but to say he was a

3774.88 --> 3777.28
genius

3776.04 --> 3779.52
[Music]

3777.28 --> 3781.28
well maybe mathematically he was a

3779.52 --> 3785.44
genius but when it concerns

3781.28 --> 3785.44
other like sensibility and

3786.559 --> 3795.2000000000003
all these things not so much

3791.52 --> 3798.079
illuminati agents oh god

3795.2 --> 3798.8799999999997
who knows he was definitely being

3798.079 --> 3801.119
groomed

3798.88 --> 3803.2000000000003
and all that he was put into that

3801.119 --> 3805.44
position and then spotlighted whether

3803.2 --> 3811.839
that makes him an illuminati agent

3805.44 --> 3811.839
i don't know but he was definitely used

3812.96 --> 3816.16
in the bigger play

3821.839 --> 3825.839
time dilation what

3827.839 --> 3830.0789999999997
no

3832.72 --> 3835.839
that doesn't make any sense there's no

3834.72 --> 3841.4399999999996
proof that

3835.839 --> 3841.44
actual flow of time even is a thing

3841.68 --> 3846.3999999999996
time is a concept and it is derived just

3845.28 --> 3849.6800000000003
like weight by the way

3846.4 --> 3851.92
it's derived from entropy

3849.68 --> 3854.319
from mechanical properties or

3851.92 --> 3858.88
electrostatic responsive properties

3854.319 --> 3861.2
from materials degeneration of materials

3858.88 --> 3862.4
right and the entropy of the

3861.2 --> 3866.0
deterioration

3862.4 --> 3869.119
is consistent and therefore from those

3866.0 --> 3870.0
consistent processes is time derived as

3869.119 --> 3873.6800000000003
a concept

3870.0 --> 3873.68
it's not actually a physical thing

3873.839 --> 3880.24
yeah time dilation what yeah yeah

3876.96 --> 3881.2
no [ __ ] what it's a freaking [ __ ]

3880.24 --> 3884.5589999999997
concept you

3881.2 --> 3885.359
[ __ ] flattered data like what kind of a

3884.559 --> 3887.599
reifying

3885.359 --> 3889.119
[ __ ] are you this is getting really

3887.599 --> 3891.76
annoying

3889.119 --> 3892.2400000000002
do you really believe that [ __ ] that is

3891.76 --> 3895.5200000000004
dumb

3892.24 --> 3898.8799999999997
as [ __ ] dude

3895.52 --> 3902.319
oh confirmed it's been confirmed oh sure

3898.88 --> 3904.48
yeah oh well you have to prove time is a

3902.319 --> 3906.079
physical thing first why don't you try

3904.48 --> 3909.28
to do that first

3906.079 --> 3911.599
instead of i don't know responding to or

3909.28 --> 3915.039
giving recognition to what i just said

3911.599 --> 3918.6400000000003
about how time is actually derived

3915.039 --> 3920.8390000000004
from physical things right

3918.64 --> 3922.0789999999997
forget the [ __ ] out here you goddamn

3920.839 --> 3925.92
[ __ ]

3922.079 --> 3925.92
piece of [ __ ] [ __ ] you

3928.4 --> 3939.52
flat earth data you're such a dick

3936.64 --> 3941.359
time dilation is proven yeah i think

3939.52 --> 3945.28
there's another part of you that's been

3941.359 --> 3951.839
dilated you should stop

3945.28 --> 3951.8390000000004
letting people do that to you huh

3953.11 --> 3956.239
[Music]

3963.839 --> 3968.64
australia's on the move

3966.96 --> 3971.28
maybe he's just gone completely

3968.64 --> 3974.0
delusional

3971.28 --> 3975.039
maybe he took a bad mushroom or

3974.0 --> 3978.4
something

3975.039 --> 3980.48
i don't know or maybe he

3978.4 --> 3982.1600000000003
actually figured out that what he first

3980.48 --> 3983.52
thought like i'll go with this and then

3982.16 --> 3986.0
he figured out that the globe

3983.52 --> 3987.839
really is absolutely a lie and he just

3986.0 --> 3990.559
broke some people do that

3987.839 --> 3993.0389999999998
and they become like they start spouting

3990.559 --> 3995.119
what they've always trusted

3993.039 --> 3997.5200000000004
like in this weird conflicted

3995.119 --> 3998.559
psychological sarcastic mood it almost

3997.52 --> 4001.359
sounded like that

3998.559 --> 4003.039
like no time dilation's real like i had

4001.359 --> 4005.839
a moment where i thought like no

4003.039 --> 4007.44
no he's actually being sarcastic this

4005.839 --> 4010.0789999999997
makes no sense he must be being

4007.44 --> 4010.079
sarcastic

4010.24 --> 4015.4399999999996
but it might be that he's just gone in a

4013.119 --> 4019.039
psychotic rage

4015.44 --> 4021.28
which in a way has sarcasm in it

4019.039 --> 4022.4
towards himself and that's part of the

4021.28 --> 4025.44
conflict

4022.4 --> 4028.2400000000002
like he can't accept what he's seen so

4025.44 --> 4028.2400000000002
maybe that is it

4032.4 --> 4035.839
be a man i have an argument

4040.16 --> 4044.8799999999997
nah some people just like to squirt they

4043.119 --> 4048.319
don't like it when people remind them

4044.88 --> 4050.559
it's a waste of time so they just squirt

4048.319 --> 4050.5589999999997
more

4060.88 --> 4068.2400000000002
i could say some really nasty things

4064.319 --> 4069.92
that i'm not going to about it

4068.24 --> 4072.0
because i don't like to be pulled into

4069.92 --> 4074.079
that sort of [ __ ] but i do think that

4072.0 --> 4076.96
some of the people that do that

4074.079 --> 4078.88
that typically go this far probably have

4076.96 --> 4081.44
really creepy secrets

4078.88 --> 4081.44
somewhere

4082.72 --> 4088.16
like bad seductions

4086.079 --> 4090.7200000000003
that they just can't let go of and they

4088.16 --> 4093.92
just got used to

4090.72 --> 4098.0
that you can supposedly hide things

4093.92 --> 4100.56
from creation from the rest from god

4098.0 --> 4101.44
all that probably don't believe god is

4100.56 --> 4103.1990000000005
actually real

4101.44 --> 4105.199
or they just don't care and they just

4103.199 --> 4108.639999999999
know i want to be able to do

4105.199 --> 4119.2789999999995
anything even it is morally

4108.64 --> 4121.759
reprehensible or absolutely atrocious

4119.279 --> 4121.759
what the

4125.679 --> 4129.52
is this p mars or something

4129.679 --> 4136.4
why did

4132.88 --> 4136.400000000001
against another one why did you

4139.12 --> 4142.5599999999995
why did you hide zz

4144.0 --> 4162.799
i don't see why that is so offensive

4160.56 --> 4164.56
might be a mistake you might have gone

4162.799 --> 4168.64
for the other one and then it moved up

4164.56 --> 4168.64
anyway i'm then hiding zzz

4168.96 --> 4175.839
don't worry

4176.319 --> 4180.4800000000005
yeah exactly that's what i thought too

4191.71 --> 4197.6
[Music]

4194.32 --> 4201.04
what am i planning on christmas day

4197.6 --> 4204.0
well sort of built

4201.04 --> 4206.239
short term tradition i always go to my

4204.0 --> 4206.239
dad

4206.8 --> 4211.28
and then have a pretty modest christmas

4209.76 --> 4217.84
dinner there

4211.28 --> 4217.84
i'm looking forward to it

4245.84 --> 4248.08
hmm

4251.679 --> 4255.76
jamboree blue hut special what

4256.32 --> 4259.2699999999995
it's sitting close oh everything is

4258.48 --> 4261.199
satan

4259.27 --> 4273.84
[Music]

4261.199 --> 4273.839999999999
oh god we're all so afraid

4275.4 --> 4280.96
[Music]

4277.12 --> 4280.96
get out of here it's the same idiot

4281.679 --> 4287.84
it took you a little longer this time to

4283.44 --> 4287.839999999999
reveal your nature didn't you

4295.36 --> 4301.839999999999
well are you worshiping santa claus are

4298.84 --> 4305.52
you

4301.84 --> 4310.08
are you just going with the holiday

4305.52 --> 4313.84
like a tradition you know it's just

4310.08 --> 4318.5599999999995
satan is at the north what

4313.84 --> 4322.8
in your opinion uh right sure

4318.56 --> 4327.280000000001
whatever that's supposed to mean but

4322.8 --> 4330.719
it's a bit of a stretch in my opinion

4327.28 --> 4334.48
like since when

4330.719 --> 4334.4800000000005
is there this personification

4340.08 --> 4343.84
and indeed like what north pole

4344.0 --> 4348.719
like we don't even know what's there for

4345.84 --> 4352.0
sure whether it's just an ocean now

4348.719 --> 4355.6
or whether there's this yeah

4352.0 --> 4358.08
this big mountain range island

4355.6 --> 4359.4400000000005
with the four rivers and then another

4358.08 --> 4361.6
sea beyond or

4359.44 --> 4363.36
inside however you see that right we

4361.6 --> 4364.159000000001
don't know we don't even know if the

4363.36 --> 4367.36
north pole

4364.159 --> 4370.48
is a point so it's assumed

4367.36 --> 4372.48
by disc projectionists

4370.48 --> 4374.879999999999
at the north pole is the ultimate

4372.48 --> 4377.678999999999
central point oh yeah so where is the

4374.88 --> 4380.159000000001
actual confirmed evidence that it is

4377.679 --> 4380.88
because what if it's not a disc what if

4380.159 --> 4383.839999999999
there's just

4380.88 --> 4385.04
a lot more room beyond maybe an entire

4383.84 --> 4388.64
realm

4385.04 --> 4392.32
worth of space beyond right

4388.64 --> 4392.320000000001
so where is he seated then

4392.64 --> 4402.0
you know it's

4399.199 --> 4404.4
before you assume any supernatural

4402.0 --> 4407.6
entity is any location

4404.4 --> 4411.5199999999995
first you gotta establish what we're in

4407.6 --> 4413.76
how about that what is this

4411.52 --> 4414.8
uh what is the orientation before you

4413.76 --> 4419.4400000000005
start

4414.8 --> 4422.56
pointing at central presumed points you

4419.44 --> 4422.5599999999995
[Music]

4424.84 --> 4440.96
know

4427.76 --> 4444.159000000001
don't take certain as they push okay

4440.96 --> 4446.719
dude for real you

4444.159 --> 4448.5599999999995
you gotta stop watching gay porn it's

4446.719 --> 4455.84
not good for you

4448.56 --> 4455.84
i mean it don't do it

4457.12 --> 4460.88
because when you do and you start to

4459.92 --> 4462.88
normalize that

4460.88 --> 4465.04
then these sort of things come rolling

4462.88 --> 4465.04
out

4465.12 --> 4469.44
you know talk about that stuff the only

4468.48 --> 4474.32
thing you prove

4469.44 --> 4474.32
is that you're gay you realize that

4480.84 --> 4483.84
right

4494.159 --> 4499.28
i just and it's just conflating lack of

4497.28 --> 4501.44
belief in god with the lack of belief in

4499.28 --> 4504.4
santa

4501.44 --> 4511.839999999999
yeah that is special they love to do

4504.4 --> 4511.839999999999
that sort of [ __ ]

4523.84 --> 4530.0
iron lung blood heads what to coca-cola

4527.12 --> 4530.0
co-opted him

4530.08 --> 4532.32
what

4533.44 --> 4539.839999999999
well what i got from it is that santa

4537.12 --> 4542.64
why he also has reindeer that it's

4539.84 --> 4544.88
actually from

4542.64 --> 4545.679
what is it an ancient shamanistic

4544.88 --> 4548.64
tradition

4545.679 --> 4550.4
of basically feeding the reindeer the

4548.64 --> 4553.679
red hooded mushrooms

4550.4 --> 4556.08
and then there those reindeer would piss

4553.679 --> 4556.8
and then in the piss is like the yeah

4556.08 --> 4559.679
that's just

4556.8 --> 4561.76
how this freaking works there's the

4559.679 --> 4564.88
refined version and then

4561.76 --> 4566.96
the shaman trips balls on that [ __ ]

4564.88 --> 4568.56
and i don't know forecast things or

4566.96 --> 4571.28
whatever does magic

4568.56 --> 4575.52
something and that that was basically

4571.28 --> 4578.08
translated into the santa claus story

4575.52 --> 4580.159000000001
which is by the way very different angle

4578.08 --> 4581.199
of approach as for example saint

4580.159 --> 4584.159
nicholas

4581.199 --> 4585.759999999999
here in the netherlands which is much

4584.159 --> 4589.5199999999995
more derived from an

4585.76 --> 4594.96
other time yeah from from the christian

4589.52 --> 4597.76
era of the saints and all that

4594.96 --> 4600.88
there's no reindeer involved in that

4597.76 --> 4604.400000000001
supposedly living in spain

4600.88 --> 4609.84
and yeah all that it's a very different

4604.4 --> 4609.839999999999
angle of approach

4611.84 --> 4615.360000000001
isn't santa real though

4620.0 --> 4625.28
child slavery center doing workshop well

4622.96 --> 4626.4800000000005
i think that the grabblers put that part

4625.28 --> 4629.44
on

4626.48 --> 4629.44
pretty sure of that

4630.96 --> 4634.64
because i don't think shaman people did

4633.44 --> 4637.5199999999995
that sort of thing

4634.64 --> 4639.400000000001
you know that the whole toy thing that

4637.52 --> 4642.56
was really the grabbler

4639.4 --> 4642.5599999999995
commercializing it

4646.48 --> 4651.12
because what did yeah another thing that

4650.159 --> 4656.0
references it

4651.12 --> 4656.0
in a way is that christ said don't take

4656.08 --> 4661.84
from the tree in that festival

4660.4 --> 4663.5199999999995
why did he do that because of the

4661.84 --> 4664.159000000001
freaking mushrooms like they originally

4663.52 --> 4666.8
didn't put

4664.159 --> 4667.599999999999
candy and all that in there cookies no

4666.8 --> 4670.4800000000005
they put

4667.6 --> 4672.400000000001
the hella synergetic mushrooms in there

4670.48 --> 4674.4
because that was what that shaman thing

4672.4 --> 4678.5599999999995
was about and that tradition

4674.4 --> 4680.5599999999995
in ways or the very old it was kind of

4678.56 --> 4682.4800000000005
like

4680.56 --> 4684.080000000001
taking in christ warn against that

4682.48 --> 4686.5599999999995
specifically like don't do

4684.08 --> 4687.199
that don't start taking mushrooms during

4686.56 --> 4690.8
then

4687.199 --> 4694.5599999999995
this is dangerous because of the spirits

4690.8 --> 4694.56
that are in the air in that period

4698.32 --> 4707.84
so that's what i think where it really

4700.159 --> 4707.839999999999
comes from

4710.4 --> 4714.32
yeah the tree yeah and those mushrooms

4712.239 --> 4717.12
do typically grow

4714.32 --> 4720.5599999999995
in pine on pine trees or in pine tree

4717.12 --> 4722.32
regions that's right

4720.56 --> 4725.1990000000005
and so it all ties in together you got

4722.32 --> 4728.239
the reindeer you got the pine tree

4725.199 --> 4731.759999999999
you got the shaman you got the mushrooms

4728.239 --> 4736.08
and that's yeah that's

4731.76 --> 4738.8
what it is or that's what's

4736.08 --> 4740.96
that's where it came from that's the

4738.8 --> 4743.28
elements that are part of the tradition

4740.96 --> 4744.88
and then it became about supposedly

4743.28 --> 4747.5199999999995
flying reindeer and

4744.88 --> 4748.0
toy shops and delivering presents during

4747.52 --> 4752.4800000000005
christmas

4748.0 --> 4752.48
eve right that's the grabbler part

4752.56 --> 4757.360000000001
that's what making it into a

4754.239 --> 4757.36
commercially driven

4760.84 --> 4763.84
festival

4764.32 --> 4770.5599999999995
does this make any sense i'm just trying

4767.36 --> 4770.5599999999995
to keep it really simple

4772.64 --> 4776.64
right well the elves might simply be the

4775.12 --> 4779.679
clockwork elves

4776.64 --> 4782.400000000001
which are known hallucinatory

4779.679 --> 4782.4
side effect

4786.08 --> 4792.4
so who knows maybe the shaman did make

4789.199 --> 4794.719
at certain points like really bizarre

4792.4 --> 4797.92
devices apparatuses

4794.719 --> 4799.52
maybe even mechanical and it's just

4797.92 --> 4802.56
presumed like

4799.52 --> 4803.52
how did he make that well when i was

4802.56 --> 4806.8
there

4803.52 --> 4808.4800000000005
i saw all these elves like clockwork

4806.8 --> 4810.320000000001
elves and they were just around him

4808.48 --> 4811.44
doing all these things so they must have

4810.32 --> 4815.36
made them

4811.44 --> 4818.5599999999995
you know something like that this is

4815.36 --> 4820.639
i don't know it just this is wild

4818.56 --> 4822.080000000001
speculation at this point based on the

4820.639 --> 4825.12
certain premise and

4822.08 --> 4825.12
data put together

4830.32 --> 4838.239
no no flying gardener of

4833.679 --> 4838.2390000000005
god okay wait

4839.199 --> 4847.839999999999
i'll just let you figure it out and i'll

4842.4 --> 4847.839999999999
be back in two minutes

4928.84 --> 4931.84
so

4937.92 --> 4940.88
you figured it out

4942.159 --> 4946.719
christmas denied the bible uh

4948.56 --> 4952.159000000001
does it but what about the tradition of

4951.52 --> 4955.84
having

4952.159 --> 4955.839999999999
christ's birth

4955.92 --> 4960.719
like with the christmas tree and all

4957.52 --> 4960.719
that i

4972.239 --> 4987.839999999999
come on guys

4991.04 --> 4994.96
18 times jesus

4996.0 --> 5001.84
the [ __ ]

5012.84 --> 5018.2390000000005
um

5015.06 --> 5018.2390000000005
[Music]

5059.37 --> 5062.5
[Music]

5072.159 --> 5075.759999999999
the helpers there

5076.0 --> 5078.32
what

5082.159 --> 5087.04
okay that sounds like freaky ayahuasca

5085.52 --> 5090.080000000001
situation indeed

5087.04 --> 5094.0
because i remember that it

5090.08 --> 5094.0
makes no like

5096.84 --> 5104.32
wow

5099.12 --> 5104.32
i've never tried shrooms aries 106 nope

5106.4 --> 5113.839999999999
now after my experience i stained the

5108.8 --> 5113.84
clean away from that sort of thing

5116.4 --> 5119.5199999999995
because they say i'm not going back to

5118.4 --> 5123.759999999999
the dark world

5119.52 --> 5126.8
i don't plan it unless i have to

5123.76 --> 5130.719
but i only like i'm not gonna

5126.8 --> 5141.84
like yeah don't look forward to it if i

5130.719 --> 5141.84
would have to

5152.84 --> 5157.329
god

5154.21 --> 5157.329
[Music]

5160.239 --> 5164.5599999999995
what is the point of saying that

5164.639 --> 5169.84
why why are you saying that

5170.8 --> 5173.84
for [ __ ] sake

5181.04 --> 5183.84
yeah you

5197.44 --> 5202.96
sorry no not sorry i just want to know

5200.08 --> 5206.159
why you would say such a thing

5202.96 --> 5208.56
don't you know the freaking consequences

5206.159 --> 5208.5599999999995
of that

5208.84 --> 5211.84
god

5212.14 --> 5215.299
[Music]

5217.53 --> 5220.95
[Music]

5221.44 --> 5226.96
like unless you disbelieve that he is

5224.8 --> 5229.1990000000005
the creator

5226.96 --> 5231.679
[Music]

5229.199 --> 5234.08
there's potentially an argument for that

5231.679 --> 5234.08
but it's

5236.84 --> 5239.84
just

5241.36 --> 5245.599999999999
it's not trolls jim west

5251.679 --> 5256.2390000000005
it's a traditional netherlands christmas

5253.52 --> 5260.400000000001
meal just like everywhere else

5256.239 --> 5263.919999999999
turkey and

5260.4 --> 5267.199
all that but yeah we don't eat turkey

5263.92 --> 5281.84
we just we just do chicken

5267.199 --> 5281.839999999999
because turkey meat is not the best

5289.36 --> 5297.199
what he created it

5292.88 --> 5297.1990000000005
but he is wonderful immersive what

5298.239 --> 5302.879999999999
god i'm starting to lose grip on what

5301.36 --> 5304.5599999999995
the hell everybody's talking about it

5302.88 --> 5306.32
seems like everybody's talking about

5304.56 --> 5307.6
different things i don't even know who

5306.32 --> 5311.36
is addressing who

5307.6 --> 5314.8
anywhere is a total chaos

5311.36 --> 5316.5599999999995
in chat can you please address

5314.8 --> 5318.2390000000005
put the name of the person you're

5316.56 --> 5320.4800000000005
addressing

5318.239 --> 5322.0
in your statements because i'm just

5320.48 --> 5324.239
completely losing track

5322.0 --> 5337.84
of what's going on here i don't know

5324.239 --> 5337.839999999999
what you guys are talking about anymore

5346.88 --> 5350.0
right so you're saying the old testament

5349.12 --> 5353.5199999999995
is basically

5350.0 --> 5357.199
baal he [ __ ] around with people

5353.52 --> 5357.6
claiming to be god and then jesus christ

5357.199 --> 5360.96
came

5357.6 --> 5360.96
and said it right

5361.28 --> 5365.84
so that is the claim what

5376.239 --> 5379.678999999999
could be said something for look i've

5378.0 --> 5382.96
stated that

5379.679 --> 5384.159
the devil or evil or satan it's all part

5382.96 --> 5387.199
of the same thing

5384.159 --> 5389.839999999999
like god is all things including

5387.199 --> 5393.599999999999
that like because it's all part of the

5389.84 --> 5398.32
design all of it is

5393.6 --> 5398.320000000001
so if you would say is evil well maybe

5398.96 --> 5404.4800000000005
jaiway did had like priorities

5402.32 --> 5407.599999999999
in a different way maybe it had a

5404.48 --> 5411.04
different objective

5407.6 --> 5414.719
why did it do that

5411.04 --> 5414.719
or was it even like

5415.12 --> 5422.4
a more like from a it's so complicated

5418.96 --> 5425.52
guys like trying to define or

5422.4 --> 5430.96
put a freaking stamp on the supposed

5425.52 --> 5433.679
god like hello you're a human being

5430.96 --> 5434.08
how could you presume to understand the

5433.679 --> 5437.12
full

5434.08 --> 5439.6
workings of timeless

5437.12 --> 5439.599999999999
beings

5442.96 --> 5447.92
but again yeah we can go by you shall

5446.239 --> 5449.759999999999
know them by their works and by their

5447.92 --> 5452.4
methods

5449.76 --> 5452.96
does that make it evil or does it make

5452.4 --> 5456.159
it a

5452.96 --> 5463.84
lesson that needed to be or what is that

5456.159 --> 5463.839999999999
what was yahweh

5465.92 --> 5477.84
jesus is bother living what

5481.12 --> 5483.5199999999995
what

5484.96 --> 5490.2390000000005
that is the most insane thing i've ever

5488.84 --> 5493.84
heard

5490.239 --> 5495.36
that's seriously insane like i can

5493.84 --> 5498.56
safely say now you're

5495.36 --> 5498.5599999999995
absolutely wrong

5498.96 --> 5502.08
if that is where that led to then you

5501.84 --> 5505.28
are

5502.08 --> 5506.08
wrong because the methods and the

5505.28 --> 5509.679
principles

5506.08 --> 5509.679
just prove it wrong

5510.48 --> 5514.718999999999
cannot be true because the essence

5516.84 --> 5519.84
disagrees

5522.05 --> 5525.77
[Music]

5535.36 --> 5542.739
[Music]

5551.36 --> 5554.719
well maybe insane is a big word it's

5553.76 --> 5558.400000000001
just such

5554.719 --> 5560.639
a blatant error i don't know any other

5558.4 --> 5563.679
word for it than to just

5560.639 --> 5566.8
call it insane at that point it's so

5563.679 --> 5568.4800000000005
incorrect like the entire essence just

5566.8 --> 5570.400000000001
mismatches so it's to draw that

5568.48 --> 5575.839999999999
conclusion it's just

5570.4 --> 5575.839999999999
absolutely wrong

5576.08 --> 5581.44
jesus oh well that's completely

5578.88 --> 5586.84
different from what you just said now

5581.44 --> 5589.36
because that is a more interesting

5586.84 --> 5592.32
dichotomy

5589.36 --> 5592.32
then who knows

5594.88 --> 5598.159000000001
maybe it's just the duality through

5597.52 --> 5603.84
which

5598.159 --> 5603.839999999999
which creation wields us

5617.28 --> 5625.759999999999
or i would even start to make a metaphor

5622.4 --> 5631.839999999999
not to offend everybody that maybe

5625.76 --> 5631.84
they are the two faces of god

5642.159 --> 5646.719
and i don't mean any exoteric

5644.639 --> 5647.76
implications with that it's purely an

5646.719 --> 5650.639
esoteric

5647.76 --> 5653.12
description so don't draw any bizarre

5650.639 --> 5654.32
conclusions from my statement two faces

5653.12 --> 5656.719
of god right

5654.32 --> 5658.0
don't mean anything about that although

5656.719 --> 5661.36
who knows where the hell

5658.0 --> 5664.639
out there it's going to connect just

5661.36 --> 5664.639
speaking esoterically

5665.52 --> 5676.159000000001
and an ante what

5673.199 --> 5676.159
now dude

5677.76 --> 5685.679
no this just does not make any logical

5681.76 --> 5688.400000000001
there's no logical consistency anymore

5685.679 --> 5688.4
what you're saying

5696.56 --> 5702.639
look arataza rather i

5700.8 --> 5704.719
have appreciated your comments in the

5702.639 --> 5706.4800000000005
past but this just doesn't make any

5704.719 --> 5710.96
sense anymore

5706.48 --> 5710.959999999999
so yeah there's nothing i can do with

5712.84 --> 5729.84
that

5714.56 --> 5729.84
all right see you later rome stanley

5750.719 --> 5755.92
look dude i i don't understand what

5753.84 --> 5759.04
you're saying anymore the context is

5755.92 --> 5759.04
just becoming really

5760.639 --> 5762.8
like

5765.04 --> 5769.28
just a bunch of words together now kind

5767.679 --> 5772.8
of scrambled

5769.28 --> 5775.92
so look i've considered about

5772.8 --> 5779.84
the potential duality of god

5775.92 --> 5779.84
and its creation and how yeah

5780.0 --> 5789.119
evil creates good and good eventually

5785.52 --> 5792.2390000000005
creates evil any other way around or

5789.119 --> 5793.5199999999995
in other combinations so one could argue

5792.239 --> 5797.839999999999
that god is indeed

5793.52 --> 5800.400000000001
also just allowing evil and designing it

5797.84 --> 5803.360000000001
to test us and then you get

5800.4 --> 5805.44
the challenge perspective right does

5803.36 --> 5808.48
that make god evil

5805.44 --> 5810.799999999999
no it makes him all things

5808.48 --> 5812.799999999999
and he has to take considerations that

5810.8 --> 5816.2390000000005
are beyond

5812.8 --> 5819.92
our mere mortal conception

5816.239 --> 5822.48
understand that's how i see it

5819.92 --> 5824.08
because to just call it evil it's like

5822.48 --> 5828.799999999999
to literally just

5824.08 --> 5832.0
put that supreme duality

5828.8 --> 5841.84
onto such a thing it's just to me

5832.0 --> 5841.84
it's just madness

5842.32 --> 5845.438999999999
[Music]

5851.119 --> 5856.5599999999995
lucifer represents ego everyone needs a

5853.6 --> 5859.4400000000005
little but not too much just interesting

5856.56 --> 5861.1990000000005
that kind of does matches with the

5859.44 --> 5864.32
rudolph steiner

5861.199 --> 5867.839999999999
esoteric angle to

5864.32 --> 5868.48
to that lucifer is really the seducing

5867.84 --> 5872.2390000000005
spirit

5868.48 --> 5872.239
and arimandi

5873.36 --> 5877.759999999999
yeah the death incarnate and depression

5876.719 --> 5881.119
and all that

5877.76 --> 5884.320000000001
two polar opposites that all

5881.119 --> 5887.5199999999995
involve the ego lucifer suggesting

5884.32 --> 5887.5199999999995
you can be god

5888.32 --> 5891.36
and the other one basically driving you

5890.639 --> 5897.84
to

5891.36 --> 5897.839999999999
death and destruction

5899.6 --> 5903.04
but those are like those are like

5901.679 --> 5907.92
spiritual frequencies

5903.04 --> 5907.92
methods con like methods

5909.76 --> 5915.679
frequencies a way of doing things

5913.28 --> 5917.28
and the natural consequences thereof

5915.679 --> 5919.4400000000005
that flow there from

5917.28 --> 5920.32
that's what that's about so it's not

5919.44 --> 5922.719
some

5920.32 --> 5924.239
literal esoteric thing that supposedly

5922.719 --> 5925.84
has happened no it's all about the

5924.239 --> 5928.799999999999
nature of spirit

5925.84 --> 5930.719
and frequency and doing things in a

5928.8 --> 5933.84
certain way

5930.719 --> 5937.6
taking into account logos how it

5933.84 --> 5938.719
is designed the preponderance of

5937.6 --> 5942.0
everything

5938.719 --> 5945.199
physical and spiritual because it is

5942.0 --> 5953.84
it is designed has to be cannot be any

5945.199 --> 5953.839999999999
other way

5964.84 --> 5968.0
what

5966.08 --> 5972.08
but what kind of a question is that

5968.0 --> 5972.08
that's a purely exoterra question

5974.88 --> 5982.159000000001
i think technically god

5978.0 --> 5986.159
can present himself or

5982.159 --> 5986.159
itself in any way

5986.719 --> 5994.0
through nature through a singular

5990.8 --> 5996.2390000000005
entity through a whole bunch of entities

5994.0 --> 5997.28
through the people and their ancestry

5996.239 --> 6001.44
like all of it

5997.28 --> 6001.44
it all depends on how you do it

6002.239 --> 6007.839999999999
and where it's going just

6005.44 --> 6008.799999999999
what are the natural consequences of

6007.84 --> 6011.04
doing it

6008.8 --> 6014.2390000000005
and what principles and energy are you

6011.04 --> 6014.239
in investing

6014.48 --> 6020.4
so to me it's all the same

6020.719 --> 6026.4
like i've i'm literally even discarding

6023.679 --> 6028.36
exit terrorism entirely more and more

6026.4 --> 6030.96
and with that comes all these

6028.36 --> 6034.0
specificities

6030.96 --> 6035.6
it's like does it matter

6034.0 --> 6037.76
to me the only thing that matters is

6035.6 --> 6038.96
that everything has to be designed and

6037.76 --> 6042.159000000001
created and

6038.96 --> 6044.08
all thoughts have to be conceived of

6042.159 --> 6047.759999999999
and that ontological primitive that it

6044.08 --> 6047.76
leads to is a singular

6047.92 --> 6055.52
entity a singular thing god the creator

6052.56 --> 6057.84
and everything else is just side notes

6055.52 --> 6062.84
it's not really relevance in the face

6057.84 --> 6065.84
of that natural consequent relation of

6062.84 --> 6065.84
existence

6071.28 --> 6079.84
like reality faces itself towards you

6074.32 --> 6079.84
however you choose to look at it

6097.52 --> 6100.2390000000005
pantheist

6105.52 --> 6108.639
god is a family

6112.719 --> 6117.76
boy is that literal is that really

6115.28 --> 6120.08
another entity so did that singular

6117.76 --> 6123.119000000001
original entity do all that and then he

6120.08 --> 6123.119
just started to create

6123.6 --> 6129.56
a self-based perpetuation of a

6126.88 --> 6130.719
family development that reflects upon

6129.56 --> 6133.1990000000005
[Music]

6130.719 --> 6134.0
the design of his creation probably who

6133.199 --> 6138.48
knows is it

6134.0 --> 6138.48
relevant to anything is it

6143.04 --> 6145.28
it's

6146.4 --> 6151.839999999999
panthers it makes the most sense oh god

6148.32 --> 6154.08
yeah sure it makes so much sense

6151.84 --> 6155.76
like why would we take into account the

6154.08 --> 6158.0
things that arwin just said

6155.76 --> 6159.6
you know when we just can't go but i

6158.0 --> 6163.199
like this the most

6159.6 --> 6177.84
i like this button

6163.199 --> 6177.839999999999
i like this little square on the paper

6184.32 --> 6192.4
all right i agree with you there

6188.0 --> 6192.4
de la fila that's

6192.639 --> 6195.92
that is my approach

6197.04 --> 6202.8
i try to follow his example in my own

6200.56 --> 6202.8
way

6203.6 --> 6208.0
and that is what i presume that it is

6206.32 --> 6211.28
what he really wanted

6208.0 --> 6213.28
it's even like quoted in the bible

6211.28 --> 6218.0
itself

6213.28 --> 6221.28
so i'm trying to do that

6218.0 --> 6224.08
figuring it out as i go

6221.28 --> 6224.8
i'm just calling it something different

6224.08 --> 6228.48
in a way

6224.8 --> 6228.4800000000005
it feels like wizardry

6228.88 --> 6234.56
it's just not this grabolified

6232.239 --> 6235.599999999999
form of wizardry as we are all

6234.56 --> 6240.0
culturally

6235.6 --> 6240.0
getting to know like it's always bad

6241.119 --> 6247.599999999999
let's see as wizardry of the light

6243.52 --> 6250.96
wizard for god for the truth

6247.6 --> 6251.84
for creation and for learning the

6250.96 --> 6261.84
lessons

6251.84 --> 6261.84
that creation has to present

6266.4 --> 6271.28
a firmament makes sense for gas pressure

6269.44 --> 6274.719
without containment

6271.28 --> 6276.5599999999995
with containment yeah but it's not

6274.719 --> 6278.8
really perfectly

6276.56 --> 6281.52
established that the firmament even is a

6278.8 --> 6281.52
physical thing

6282.639 --> 6284.8
so

6286.639 --> 6291.92
we don't need any specifics on

6289.679 --> 6293.76
how to we just have to establish that

6291.92 --> 6295.28
there is gas pressure because we can

6293.76 --> 6297.679
breathe so that means there is

6295.28 --> 6299.759999999999
containment now how this containment is

6297.679 --> 6303.119
actually

6299.76 --> 6305.84
established naturally

6303.119 --> 6307.599999999999
we don't know there can be all kinds of

6305.84 --> 6310.8
ways

6307.6 --> 6311.92
many many different directions yet

6310.8 --> 6316.4800000000005
people just say no

6311.92 --> 6319.679
no it's just a dome

6316.48 --> 6320.879999999999
because yeah they don't like to stare

6319.679 --> 6323.36
into the range of

6320.88 --> 6324.96
possible options and consider like yeah

6323.36 --> 6328.0
maybe there's like

6324.96 --> 6331.84
20 different type of model approaches

6328.0 --> 6331.84
what could be going on

6332.08 --> 6337.84
i've laid them out many times a lot of

6334.32 --> 6340.639
them but it's not 20 but

6337.84 --> 6341.4400000000005
pretty different type of options and

6340.639 --> 6344.88
it's just

6341.44 --> 6347.28
glanced over and forgotten about

6344.88 --> 6348.0
i wonder how long that's going to take

6347.28 --> 6351.199
or or

6348.0 --> 6353.679
is it just is it consensus decided that

6351.199 --> 6356.08
the earth is a disk and there's a dome

6353.679 --> 6359.119
and you just don't want to know any more

6356.08 --> 6362.159
than that is that it

6359.119 --> 6362.159
is that what you want

6362.4 --> 6366.08
and then you call the dome firmament

6364.32 --> 6367.44
because then it's tied into the bible

6366.08 --> 6370.48
it's all right you don't have to think

6367.44 --> 6370.48
about it any further

6370.88 --> 6374.96
are you sick of the mystery are you sick

6373.36 --> 6377.04
of not knowing

6374.96 --> 6378.4
do you just want to move on with the

6377.04 --> 6381.199
details

6378.4 --> 6382.799999999999
like fix the physics issues that were

6381.199 --> 6386.159
there with the globe and just

6382.8 --> 6386.88
get to presuppositions that'll just make

6386.159 --> 6389.28
you stop

6386.88 --> 6391.84
wondering about all these unknowns is

6389.28 --> 6394.239
that what you want

6391.84 --> 6396.0
you just want to stop thinking about it

6394.239 --> 6396.799999999999
you don't want a mystery out there

6396.0 --> 6400.56
anymore so

6396.8 --> 6402.8
just jump to the easiest model

6400.56 --> 6405.52
that most people will agree on and then

6402.8 --> 6415.84
you can let it go

6405.52 --> 6415.84
is that is that's what's happening

6416.32 --> 6420.32
and that's a question in general by the

6419.119 --> 6421.599999999999
way

6420.32 --> 6424.799999999999
because i do think a lot of flat

6421.6 --> 6428.159000000001
earthers have issue with it

6424.8 --> 6431.119000000001
they don't really want to

6428.159 --> 6432.08
figure it out how many people out there

6431.119 --> 6435.36
are even just

6432.08 --> 6437.36
properly mechanically theorizing about

6435.36 --> 6441.599999999999
the possibilities

6437.36 --> 6441.599999999999
i don't see anybody even doing that

6441.84 --> 6447.119000000001
feels like i'm the only one that's

6443.52 --> 6447.119000000001
actually doing that sometimes

6454.96 --> 6459.36
theories of the containment of this

6456.4 --> 6463.36
realm okay that sounds interesting

6459.36 --> 6463.36
de la fita elfinor

6466.639 --> 6471.84
open or

6493.199 --> 6502.08
because god ain't hearing you no

6497.199 --> 6502.08
what why would you say that

6502.159 --> 6507.28
how do you know what is it god hearing

6504.96 --> 6507.28
you

6509.6 --> 6512.719
because i'm pretty sure god hears all

6511.84 --> 6516.400000000001
he's just

6512.719 --> 6520.0
not going to respond

6516.4 --> 6523.36
maybe to your primitive request

6520.0 --> 6526.56
or complaint because maybe has

6523.36 --> 6527.119
more important things to do maybe that's

6526.56 --> 6530.159000000001
the case

6527.119 --> 6534.0
does that make him evil or

6530.159 --> 6537.36
does that make you just subpar

6534.0 --> 6540.48
in a position where you shouldn't be

6537.36 --> 6542.08
petitioning to contact him maybe

6540.48 --> 6544.718999999999
because he has better things to do and

6542.08 --> 6547.5199999999995
maybe christ realized that

6544.719 --> 6549.52
and then sort of put himself in that

6547.52 --> 6552.400000000001
position

6549.52 --> 6552.96
to take all the idiots with their base

6552.4 --> 6556.48
basil

6552.96 --> 6560.96
questions maybe something like that

6556.48 --> 6563.678999999999
it's a very rough quick esoteric

6560.96 --> 6563.679
scenario

6566.08 --> 6569.679
but i was thought that yeah if if god is

6569.119 --> 6573.36
actually

6569.679 --> 6576.719
finding it worthy to contact you

6573.36 --> 6576.719
you probably got a problem

6577.28 --> 6583.119
something that needs to be done

6581.599 --> 6585.04
and that's probably not going to be

6583.119 --> 6587.92
received

6585.04 --> 6589.599
very nicely because god does not give

6587.92 --> 6592.159
you a choice

6589.599 --> 6593.04
when he actually faces you or maybe

6592.159 --> 6596.48
that's

6593.04 --> 6596.88
wrong i don't know maybe that's part of

6596.48 --> 6600.0
my

6596.88 --> 6603.04
weird as esoteric experience my dark

6600.0 --> 6603.04
world vision [ __ ]

6604.56 --> 6611.84
although i do remember other things too

6608.08 --> 6611.84
it's just

6631.599 --> 6639.84
right ares 106. yeah you're

6634.8 --> 6639.84
you're right

6647.28 --> 6653.84
hey thank you m for the five pound super

6649.92 --> 6653.84
chat the nation much appreciated

6657.599 --> 6664.56
all right but look in general

6661.36 --> 6666.32
i've seen i've been to the church mormon

6664.56 --> 6668.320000000001
church here and just seeing

6666.32 --> 6670.4
just good and decent christians and then

6668.32 --> 6673.599
i see how they just

6670.4 --> 6675.679
whine seriously

6673.599 --> 6676.8
it's like wine and complete with the

6675.679 --> 6680.4
most basal

6676.8 --> 6682.0
dumb [ __ ] and they bother god or christ

6680.4 --> 6685.28
with it and i'm like

6682.0 --> 6688.48
my god you can't be serious

6685.28 --> 6692.159
like you think that's

6688.48 --> 6692.159
useful or good or

6692.84 --> 6699.76
wanted by the creator that you do that

6696.4 --> 6703.5199999999995
or are you just muttering on

6699.76 --> 6703.52
not really knowing what you're doing

6704.239 --> 6711.119
like is that a worthy inquiry to a deity

6707.679 --> 6714.639
to the creator to christ like i

6711.119 --> 6717.759999999999
sometimes i just don't get it why they

6714.639 --> 6721.76
pray nonsense

6717.76 --> 6724.400000000001
or just spout nonsense

6721.76 --> 6724.96
but then again it might be a development

6724.4 --> 6726.638999999999
process

6724.96 --> 6728.2390000000005
it's just that with some people they

6726.639 --> 6730.4800000000005
just mutter the same

6728.239 --> 6732.32
nonsense complaints or whatever things

6730.48 --> 6735.04
they do towards

6732.32 --> 6736.96
god or christ in their prayers and just

6735.04 --> 6737.679
doesn't really evolve their entire life

6736.96 --> 6751.84
it just stays

6737.679 --> 6751.84
the same so yeah thank goodness

6753.92 --> 6760.88
i use it as a foundation like

6757.84 --> 6760.88
a head start

6763.599 --> 6765.84
what

6774.32 --> 6777.759999999999
the mediator between ghana and man

6776.239 --> 6780.839999999999
that's interesting that's an

6777.76 --> 6784.56
interesting concept and who knows

6780.84 --> 6788.0
esoterically i get that

6784.56 --> 6790.88
that's what i tried to communicate

6788.0 --> 6792.0
but still dude you're making just a lot

6790.88 --> 6795.92
of wild statements

6792.0 --> 6799.199
today and some of them i find

6795.92 --> 6799.1990000000005
slightly incoherent

6800.4 --> 6805.04
just doesn't match to me

6805.52 --> 6810.2390000000005
i don't know anyway i'm gonna round out

6808.0 --> 6813.52
the show

6810.239 --> 6814.959999999999
so thanks everyone for coming i hope you

6813.52 --> 6816.639
like this show i thought it was

6814.96 --> 6819.52
interesting very

6816.639 --> 6820.08
esoteric discussions concerning god and

6819.52 --> 6822.639
religion

6820.08 --> 6824.0
and it was good it was a good chat today

6822.639 --> 6826.8
so

6824.0 --> 6827.599
yeah some couple of wild things here and

6826.8 --> 6830.56
there but

6827.599 --> 6832.88
i'm still very happy with just the

6830.56 --> 6834.88
seriousness of the participation in chat

6832.88 --> 6836.639
so thank you for being here and being

6834.88 --> 6839.599
part of that helping

6836.639 --> 6841.36
me to do this because without the input

6839.599 --> 6844.56
it's just me just waiting

6841.36 --> 6846.48
usually so thanks for the discussion and

6844.56 --> 6848.159000000001
the information and the ideas

6846.48 --> 6849.678999999999
even though some of them were quite out

6848.159 --> 6852.08
there

6849.679 --> 6854.0
but then again some of my ideas might be

6852.08 --> 6858.32
a little bit out there too

6854.0 --> 6860.239
so uh if you like this show

6858.32 --> 6862.239
