285.04 --> 289.44
realized that's just way too warm i'll

287.6 --> 291.759
probably just drink half a cup and then

289.44 --> 293.84
the rest will just grow cold

291.759 --> 294.88
so i'm not doing that i do have a gusto

293.84 --> 297.84
though

294.88 --> 297.84
really felt like that

307.52 --> 311.59999999999997
also have some orange juice in the in

310.0 --> 314.56
the cooler

311.6 --> 314.56
i might get that

316.32 --> 319.59999999999997
hey thinking star water

321.12 --> 325.4
snowed there what

325.44 --> 329.32
yeah that is kind of odd

341.039 --> 345.44

you did get like my last reply mail

345.44 --> 351.36

to get the three in

351.36 --> 355.199
the second

352.56 --> 357.28000000000003
like the last three in my address is

355.199 --> 358.72
roman numerals

357.28 --> 360.4
right

358.72 --> 363.639
anyway

360.4 --> 363.63899999999995
any clutch

372.0 --> 375.0
right

380.0 --> 382.639
god

381.12 --> 385.28000000000003
hey hi slo-mo

382.639 --> 387.199
moon buggy yeah

385.28 --> 389.28
maniac was making claims to you it's

387.199 --> 391.28000000000003
cool babies yeah

389.28 --> 392.55999999999995
there's some of them that just really

391.28 --> 394.55999999999995
just

392.56 --> 395.919
shove that in your face i had that too

394.56 --> 398.479
when was it

395.919 --> 403.479
last time i came um

398.479 --> 403.479
was that guy i don't remember who it was

410.479 --> 414.0
with zero proof indeed

417.599 --> 422.96
and like even when i would try to get

420.0 --> 424.72
real about it like how how is it

422.96 --> 427.12
probably like

424.72 --> 429.199
it's not completely entirely fake only

427.12 --> 432.08
just the industrial level that people

429.199 --> 435.199
imagine about it

432.08 --> 438.4
that is probably exaggerated in ways

435.199 --> 440.40000000000003
like when the actual individuals become

438.4 --> 442.96
involved

440.4 --> 447.479
much more sparingly probably but they

442.96 --> 447.479
just didn't really want to hear about it

457.199 --> 460.319
oh that maniac

461.36 --> 466.16
wait are you talking about that time

463.28 --> 466.15999999999997
where i was on

466.319 --> 470.40000000000003
slow mo moon buggy i'm not sure now

471.599 --> 476.199
since you're mentioning that maniac

478.0 --> 482.319
oh you are talking about that time all

480.08 --> 482.31899999999996
right

490.84 --> 494.479
yep well that's the whole problem about

493.599 --> 495.36
it

494.479 --> 498.15999999999997
about

495.36 --> 499.599
that subject and all that

498.16 --> 503.199
is that

499.599 --> 505.44
like well truthers

503.199 --> 508.40000000000003
they basically latch on to it too much

505.44 --> 511.68
and then they start drowning in it

508.4 --> 511.67999999999995
and it just drives you mad

513.36 --> 516.479
hey george sanford

519.039 --> 521.8389999999999
hsc net

523.279 --> 528.12

576.56 --> 581.8389999999999
i have no idea what you're talking about

579.36 --> 584.0

581.839 --> 585.6
lawsuits and all that that are happening

584.0 --> 588.08
out there

585.6 --> 590.399

588.08 --> 592.72
i bump into through like watching alex

590.399 --> 595.76
jones and all that

592.72 --> 598.76
but i'm not like really on top of that

595.76 --> 601.9399999999999

691.839 --> 697.8000000000001
sesame street

694.16 --> 697.8
is what

714.16 --> 720.519
is that like an american tv show or

716.399 --> 720.519
something i've never heard of that

727.18 --> 730.3499999999999
[Music]

761.68 --> 767.959
this is wow

763.519 --> 767.9590000000001
that is so before my time

773.2 --> 778.88
right well i don't think the netherlands

775.04 --> 780.26
has ever touched upon any of that

778.88 --> 783.419
just before the

780.26 --> 783.419

783.839 --> 789.0400000000001

more connecting up to the media

789.04 --> 795.639
of america and all that

791.68 --> 795.6389999999999
because i never heard of that

808.16 --> 811.16
hmm

824.639 --> 827.639
okay

829.279 --> 833.4399999999999
mid 70s

831.04 --> 833.4399999999999
all right

841.279 --> 845.0
what it would look like

867.04 --> 870.36
oh wow

870.399 --> 874.32
that is so

872.079 --> 875.68
incredibly 70s

874.32 --> 878.399
uh

875.68 --> 880.399
i think i probably have seen some clips

878.399 --> 883.36
of this before it's just i've never like

880.399 --> 884.959
oh here is the show

883.36 --> 887.92
but

884.959 --> 891.279
like snippets here and there i some of

887.92 --> 893.36
this does look familiar but it's like

891.279 --> 895.12
seen it maybe a couple of times and was

893.36 --> 898.0
very not interested

895.12 --> 899.92
because it's like where's all the space

898.0 --> 903.32
why isn't everything just planet so i

899.92 --> 903.3199999999999
wasn't interested

918.24 --> 921.24
um

939.199 --> 945.8389999999999
the [ __ ] there's a bee called mr dooby

943.36 --> 947.44
and he literally looks like a

945.839 --> 949.9200000000001
a joint

947.44 --> 949.9200000000001
the [ __ ]

950.32 --> 954.88
is that part of the show yeah it seems

952.24 --> 957.88
to be

954.88 --> 957.88
weird

959.66 --> 966.2199999999999
[Music]

975.44 --> 977.6800000000001

overnight or something like what what

999.12 --> 1002.88
are you talking about i'm healthier in

1000.8 --> 1006.12
buffer

1002.88 --> 1006.12
do i

1014.079 --> 1018.4799999999999
i think this uh might be it might be a

1016.399 --> 1021.199
bit

1018.48 --> 1023.1800000000001
yeah premature but i think it's a derp

sigmund and the sea monster what

1054.16 --> 1057.64
what is that

1088.48 --> 1094.44
right so

1090.08 --> 1094.4399999999998
yeah i think we got clowns

1108.16 --> 1111.8400000000001
right anyway

1110.08 --> 1116.08
weird

1111.84 --> 1117.76
children's programming from the 70s

1116.08 --> 1121.24
something that i have very little

1117.76 --> 1121.24
knowledge about

1124.62 --> 1127.6899999999998
[Music]

1132.88 --> 1137.2800000000002
always blew up while the coyote

1136.16 --> 1139.44
right but

1137.28 --> 1142.0
yeah but that's kind of

1139.44 --> 1145.679
well known speaking star wars i mean

1142.0 --> 1145.679
roadrunner has been popular like

1145.76 --> 1149.2
throughout the 80s as well

1149.44 --> 1157.28
like cartoons even the older cartoons

1154.88 --> 1157.2800000000002
i said

1157.44 --> 1161.1200000000001
warner brothers cartoons and all that

1159.039 --> 1163.28
yeah they started very early but they

1161.12 --> 1166.32
lasted very long i mean they're they're

1163.28 --> 1167.2
basically still classics

1166.32 --> 1170.2
still

1167.2 --> 1170.2
affected

1180.0 --> 1183.6
which is by the way pretty revolutionary

1182.799 --> 1186.16
right

1183.6 --> 1188.1599999999999
i mean there isn't a lot of cartoon

1186.16 --> 1189.52
shows and all that

1188.16 --> 1193.2
that have really

1189.52 --> 1197.28
passed the test of time

1193.2 --> 1199.919
like things got pretty serious like

1197.28 --> 1203.52
after the 80s

1199.919 --> 1206.48
80s some just got real big boosts

1203.52 --> 1209.2
and after that point like cartoons

1206.48 --> 1211.039
became a little bit more serious more

1209.2 --> 1212.48
more like okay let's really make

1211.039 --> 1215.039
something from this instead of just

1212.48 --> 1216.799
quick entertainment

1215.039 --> 1219.28
and so

1216.799 --> 1221.679
that there even is cartoons from before

1219.28 --> 1224.8799999999999
that time that are still good

1221.679 --> 1228.799
is is remarkable

1224.88 --> 1228.7990000000002
that's like applause worthy

1232.4 --> 1238.3200000000002
and it's weird you know because

1234.799 --> 1240.4
you realize also that back then even

1238.32 --> 1242.6399999999999
cartoons were kind of looked down upon

1240.4 --> 1244.48
it's like that's just dumb children's

1242.64 --> 1245.919
entertainment

1244.48 --> 1250.96
so to then

1245.919 --> 1250.96
have a couple of these cartoonists

1251.6 --> 1257.52
make effective 3d anime of 3d

1254.88 --> 1261.3600000000001
just drawn cartoons

1257.52 --> 1265.36
that even now are still funny to watch

1261.36 --> 1265.36
that's quite remarkable in my opinion

1272.08 --> 1275.84
i never liked woody woodpecker because

1273.84 --> 1279.28
he was always starting [ __ ] yeah me too

1275.84 --> 1279.28
i freaking hated that thing

about tony rickman

1366.08 --> 1372.52
is that some show or something doesn't

1368.24 --> 1372.52
sound like it was meant for children

1415.28 --> 1422.44
what the [ __ ] that was part of a

1417.76 --> 1422.44
children's cartoon that's crazy

1435.25 --> 1438.42
[Music]

1456.48 --> 1462.32
these were amazing

1458.799 --> 1466.0
yeah man with the moon landing and [ __ ]

1462.32 --> 1466.0
i mean everything's possible then

1470.88 --> 1475.6000000000001
maybe it did kind of work like that

1472.96 --> 1477.52
seriously you know like oh well if the

1475.6 --> 1479.12
moon landing is possible and everybody's

1477.52 --> 1480.799
all clapping for that and taking that

1479.12 --> 1482.8799999999999
super serious

1480.799 --> 1485.12
well we can then just do our weird

1482.88 --> 1487.3600000000001
hippie [ __ ] and like

1485.12 --> 1490.4799999999998
like screw you the man we're just gonna

1487.36 --> 1490.4799999999998
do whatever we want

1497.2 --> 1501.799
i don't know i don't know what i'm

1498.48 --> 1501.799
talking about

1506.48 --> 1509.6
i i

1507.52 --> 1511.679
i don't know i don't even know like on

1509.6 --> 1512.6399999999999
average how many even of the hippie

1511.679 --> 1514.96
types

1512.64 --> 1518.72
knew or had a suspicion that the moon

1514.96 --> 1518.72
landing was fake at the time

1522.559 --> 1526.96
i mean

1524.08 --> 1526.96
a lot of like

1527.679 --> 1531.679
hippie groups would have probably been

1529.52 --> 1532.6399999999999
interested like in

1531.679 --> 1534.64
older

1532.64 --> 1537.279
and foreign religions and all that and

1534.64 --> 1540.159
then maybe through that way bumped into

1537.279 --> 1541.039
things like flat earth and all that

1540.159 --> 1542.72
but

1541.039 --> 1546.48
i mean that wouldn't have been like

1542.72 --> 1549.1200000000001
spreading around like wildfire

1546.48 --> 1551.679
at the time i think

1549.12 --> 1553.84
or maybe they'd just like wait until

1551.679 --> 1555.919
everybody got super stoned and then just

1553.84 --> 1558.32
started talking like oh guys that you

1555.919 --> 1559.5200000000002
know was actually flat man it's all a

1558.32 --> 1562.96
lie

1559.52 --> 1562.96
i don't know i don't know

1566.88 --> 1570.48
but i think on average not a lot of

1569.2 --> 1572.799
people really

1570.48 --> 1576.48
like knew with absolute certainty like

1572.799 --> 1576.48
this moon landing thing is faked

1580.08 --> 1583.4399999999998
unless they were the types that were

1581.52 --> 1586.6399999999999
just per default say everything the

1583.44 --> 1586.64
government does is faked

1586.799 --> 1593.559
and they would not really look into it

1588.88 --> 1593.5590000000002
so yeah and that doesn't count

1599.36 --> 1603.12
couldn't even record to analyze yeah

1601.919 --> 1604.72
yeah

1603.12 --> 1607.4399999999998
but they didn't have tape recorders

1604.72 --> 1608.88
already so they did they could like

1607.44 --> 1610.48
tape

1608.88 --> 1613.2
sound tape

1610.48 --> 1615.52
things that came over the tv like even i

1613.2 --> 1618.0
did that as a kid

1615.52 --> 1619.84
because it's just easy

1618.0 --> 1622.88
well you need a tape recorder keep it

1619.84 --> 1626.6789999999999
next to the to the speaker there you go

1622.88 --> 1626.679
you got a sound recording

1628.159 --> 1630.68
but yeah the video that was still very

1630.159 --> 1636.92
difficult

1630.68 --> 1636.92
[Music]

1639.84 --> 1643.84
on the other hand i think that even back

1642.08 --> 1647.9189999999999
back then

1643.84 --> 1649.6789999999999
they probably would be repeating like

1647.919 --> 1651.919
yeah

1649.679 --> 1654.919
nasa stuff and launches all the time

1651.919 --> 1654.919
anyway

1655.039 --> 1657.76
right

1656.08 --> 1660.6399999999999
i don't know i wasn't in the united

1657.76 --> 1663.2
states right i wasn't even born yet

1660.64 --> 1666.72
but i can imagine that they spent quite

1663.2 --> 1669.679
a lot of money on the entire project

1666.72 --> 1670.88
so they're going to play it on tvs i

1669.679 --> 1672.5590000000002
don't know maybe there was even a

1670.88 --> 1674.24
channel where he was just

1672.559 --> 1676.8799999999999
all day long just

1674.24 --> 1679.039
nasa people blabbering

1676.88 --> 1680.7990000000002
a bunch of atheists talking about outer

1679.039 --> 1682.799
space and then just oh look at this

1680.799 --> 1683.9189999999999
rocket launch look at that rocket launch

1682.799 --> 1685.76
was there

1683.919 --> 1688.3990000000001
like a channel or was it just always

1685.76 --> 1690.32
like oh it's during this hour in the

1688.399 --> 1691.76
evening

1690.32 --> 1694.48
everything about

1691.76 --> 1696.24
nasa in space i don't know how they

1694.48 --> 1697.919
programmed it but they must they

1696.24 --> 1700.08
couldn't have just

1697.919 --> 1701.679
shown a couple of things in an occasion

1700.08 --> 1704.08
and then left it to it there's too much

1701.679 --> 1706.159
money invested and it's literally about

1704.08 --> 1708.1589999999999
the programming so how did they arrange

1706.159 --> 1709.7600000000002
that

1708.159 --> 1713.3990000000001
at in the day

1709.76 --> 1713.399
do any of you remember

1751.84 --> 1755.039
okay jeff cassette

1758.48 --> 1761.679
what am i getting at logical conclusion

1760.799 --> 1764.72
is

1761.679 --> 1767.3600000000001
did they replay

1764.72 --> 1769.919
like the historical event

1767.36 --> 1772.8799999999999
a lot that they blabber on about it a

1769.919 --> 1776.159
lot did they replay that footage a lot

1772.88 --> 1776.159
on the television because

1776.48 --> 1780.48
i take it that

1778.399 --> 1782.399
with all that money spent

1780.48 --> 1784.159
it would have been good for them if

1782.399 --> 1785.36
there would be people getting obsessed

1784.159 --> 1787.2
with it

1785.36 --> 1789.12
if you just play it once on the

1787.2 --> 1791.3600000000001
television oh like oh look the moon

1789.12 --> 1793.1999999999998
landing oh this happened and

1791.36 --> 1795.9189999999999
maybe a little interview and that's it

1793.2 --> 1797.679
and nothing else then

1795.919 --> 1799.039
how are people going to become obsessed

1797.679 --> 1800.88
with it

1799.039 --> 1803.279
right they're literally trying to

1800.88 --> 1805.7600000000002
program culture so repeating it over and

1803.279 --> 1806.799
over again would be the logical thing to

1805.76 --> 1810.32
do

1806.799 --> 1812.48
i'm asking did they constantly

1810.32 --> 1813.52
play that on the television was there

1812.48 --> 1816.96
like a

1813.52 --> 1818.559
a full-on moon landing nasa channel that

1816.96 --> 1820.159
was just

1818.559 --> 1822.6399999999999
playing all the time

1820.159 --> 1825.5200000000002
because that would be logical

1822.64 --> 1825.5200000000002
if they had that

1827.039 --> 1831.24
just look at all the money they spent

1836.0 --> 1839.52
it was everywhere apart from yeah i'm

1837.84 --> 1841.6789999999999
not saying live

1839.52 --> 1843.44
things all the time just the programming

1841.679 --> 1844.5590000000002
all the time going through it like oh

1843.44 --> 1846.0800000000002
look

1844.559 --> 1848.8799999999999
this person

1846.08 --> 1848.8799999999999
that person

1849.12 --> 1853.76
and reruns and all that right all the

1851.44 --> 1853.76
time

1854.08 --> 1861.12
[Music]

1857.039 --> 1861.12
there were only three networks

1862.84 --> 1867.12
hmm

1864.559 --> 1869.6
not okay

1867.12 --> 1871.84
really only three that was it

1869.6 --> 1871.84
oh

1876.0 --> 1879.0
hmm

1882.799 --> 1886.799
right yeah i'm not expecting their

1884.72 --> 1888.48
entire channel to be dedicated but at

1886.799 --> 1891.12
least it would be they would have like

1888.48 --> 1894.3990000000001
periodically brought it back dedicated

1891.12 --> 1897.9189999999999
an hour or something in the day

1894.399 --> 1897.9189999999999
to doing that constantly

1901.2 --> 1903.919
kind of in the same way like in the

1902.799 --> 1906.24
netherlands

1903.919 --> 1908.24
they just had it programmed that

1906.24 --> 1910.0
saturday morning cartoons and we weren't

1908.24 --> 1911.76
the only one it's something it was done

1910.0 --> 1914.32
in america in general

1911.76 --> 1916.24
that just a lot of cartoons would be

1914.32 --> 1918.399
there

1916.24 --> 1921.6
on different channels

1918.399 --> 1923.76
they would all do it on saturday morning

1921.6 --> 1925.36
starting from pretty early to like the

1923.76 --> 1926.799
afternoon

1925.36 --> 1929.1999999999998
and it was always there on saturday and

1926.799 --> 1931.2
everybody was all the kids were while i

1929.2 --> 1933.76
was watching those cartoons all said it

1931.2 --> 1936.3990000000001
but that's a choice he programmed it

1933.76 --> 1938.96
like that make it into a thing

1936.399 --> 1940.8799999999999
so i'm asking did they do something like

1938.96 --> 1942.64
that similar to that

1940.88 --> 1945.1200000000001
with the space programming so that it

1942.64 --> 1946.3200000000002
became a thing

1945.12 --> 1947.6
in the day

1946.32 --> 1952.799
or

1947.6 --> 1952.799
a weekly thing something periodic

1957.76 --> 1963.84
let's replace it later

1959.679 --> 1963.8400000000001
ketchup right right right yeah exactly

1975.86 --> 1978.9599999999998
[Music]

2000.24 --> 2004.72
the bible thrived in times of low

2002.64 --> 2007.039
literacy

2004.72 --> 2007.039
uh

2008.559 --> 2011.84
that makes no sense

2010.24 --> 2014.0
i think we got another

2011.84 --> 2017.039
numpty uh

2014.0 --> 2017.039
derp alert here

2017.2 --> 2022.72
yeah aaa

2019.279 --> 2024.72
you realize though that literacy

2022.72 --> 2027.6000000000001
is not a common thing

2024.72 --> 2030.08
pretty much up until

2027.6 --> 2030.08
what is it

2032.12 --> 2035.6
250 years ago

2034.399 --> 2038.1589999999999
yeah

2035.6 --> 2039.039
that's when like there was this real

2038.159 --> 2040.72
thing

2039.039 --> 2041.679
this push

2040.72 --> 2043.84
to

2041.679 --> 2046.799
to make yeah

2043.84 --> 2048.399
to teach children how to read and write

2046.799 --> 2052.24
before that

2048.399 --> 2052.24
it wasn't really a common thing

2052.96 --> 2058.7200000000003
i mean you it would it would be more

2055.04 --> 2060.8
considered like an elite skill

2058.72 --> 2062.9599999999996
and the further back in time you go the

2060.8 --> 2066.0
more it would have been considered in

2062.96 --> 2066.0
the lead skill so

2066.8 --> 2069.44
yeah

2067.919 --> 2070.24
most of

2069.44 --> 2072.32
time

2070.24 --> 2074.9599999999996
people have on average been illiterate

2072.32 --> 2079.04
that has nothing to do with

2074.96 --> 2079.04
that makes them believe in the bible

2079.28 --> 2081.679
right

2080.159 --> 2083.679
i mean

2081.679 --> 2085.839
in medieval times

2083.679 --> 2088.7200000000003
or at least how we think of it

2085.839 --> 2091.359
yeah they were illiterate but that's not

2088.72 --> 2093.919
the problem like they wouldn't be

2091.359 --> 2096.7999999999997
allowed a bible yeah

2093.919 --> 2098.7999999999997
those times the common folk did not were

2096.8 --> 2102.7200000000003
not allowed to

2098.8 --> 2104.079
have possession of the book that was the

2102.72 --> 2105.839
issue

2104.079 --> 2108.4
not that they couldn't read it and

2105.839 --> 2110.56
therefore they believed it no

2108.4 --> 2112.8
they weren't allowed by the priesthood

2110.56 --> 2114.0
to even have those books

2112.8 --> 2116.8
okay

2114.0 --> 2120.24
so it doesn't seem like you really know

2116.8 --> 2120.2400000000002
what you're talking about there

2122.24 --> 2125.1189999999997
hey manu

2128.64 --> 2132.4
people would march to church to be told

2130.72 --> 2134.9599999999996
what to think yeah but they didn't want

2132.4 --> 2134.96
that though

2135.44 --> 2142.079
yeah they were simply being dictated to

2139.2 --> 2142.0789999999997
by a priesthood

2143.28 --> 2147.28
and most of them wanted to be good

2145.04 --> 2149.04
people they believed to a limited range

2147.28 --> 2150.5600000000004
into like the stories of like oh if

2149.04 --> 2151.839
you're a good person you go to heaven if

2150.56 --> 2153.52
you're bad you go to hell right the

2151.839 --> 2154.24
basics

2153.52 --> 2156.8
but

2154.24 --> 2159.2799999999997
most people would not like the

2156.8 --> 2161.2000000000003
priesthood they would know

2159.28 --> 2163.599
that a lot of them were grabblers and up

2161.2 --> 2167.5989999999997
to no good indeed did sneaky things and

2163.599 --> 2167.599
[ __ ] that were very evil

2167.839 --> 2173.04
most people kind of knew that

2170.72 --> 2176.16
except for those that were just

2173.04 --> 2178.96
like really oblivious

2176.16 --> 2181.04
right it wasn't about

2178.96 --> 2183.52
oh we need the information from the

2181.04 --> 2185.68
priesthood to get the book right no

2183.52 --> 2188.24
it was just like these people are ruling

2185.68 --> 2191.359
over us and if we don't play their game

2188.24 --> 2192.3199999999997
they literally kill us

2191.359 --> 2194.7999999999997
right

2192.32 --> 2197.52
it had very little to do really with the

2194.8 --> 2200.52
teachings in the book it was just power

2197.52 --> 2200.52
theocracy

2202.96 --> 2207.599
right was politics

2205.119 --> 2209.92
more it was more about politics really

2207.599 --> 2209.92
power

2212.079 --> 2216.2400000000002
it had nothing to do with people not

2214.32 --> 2218.4
being able to read and write because

2216.24 --> 2221.4399999999996
they weren't allowed to freaking read

2218.4 --> 2223.2000000000003
the bible okay they weren't allowed

2221.44 --> 2225.2000000000003
besides even if they could read and

2223.2 --> 2227.5989999999997
write their own language the bible was

2225.2 --> 2229.4399999999996
back then even in latin

2227.599 --> 2231.52
allegedly

2229.44 --> 2235.64
and that's not a language that was like

2231.52 --> 2235.64
a secret language basically

2244.88 --> 2247.28
anyway

2247.52 --> 2250.72
it was all kept very secret

2249.76 --> 2254.079
it was

2250.72 --> 2254.9599999999996
a theocracy but like a crypto theocracy

2254.079 --> 2257.6800000000003
like

2254.96 --> 2258.96
they were like the key secret keepers of

2257.68 --> 2263.0789999999997
the knowledge

2258.96 --> 2263.079
and it would be very secretive

2270.24 --> 2272.56
anyway

2276.8 --> 2280.2400000000002
saying the illiteracy help

2281.119 --> 2284.839
no not really

2286.32 --> 2288.6400000000003
i mean

2293.839 --> 2297.2799999999997
no

2295.68 --> 2300.3999999999996
didn't really help

2297.28 --> 2302.1600000000003
for or against it

2300.4 --> 2304.64
the the power position that the

2302.16 --> 2307.359
priesthood back then took

2304.64 --> 2308.16
was much more of a dominant influence

2307.359 --> 2313.839
than

2308.16 --> 2313.839
their illiteracy of the public okay

2328.72 --> 2334.2
it wouldn't have been widely served yeah

2331.2 --> 2334.2
correct

2345.04 --> 2350.16
right and it's logical because what they

2347.28 --> 2352.96
did by doing that making an english

2350.16 --> 2355.92
bible and all that yeah

2352.96 --> 2358.64
they took the monopoly power away from

2355.92 --> 2361.119
the catholic church in a sense

2358.64 --> 2363.359
it wouldn't just be like okay pope you

2361.119 --> 2365.28
tell me what's in there because i can't

2363.359 --> 2368.72
read that

2365.28 --> 2371.0400000000004
and so you could say that king of

2368.72 --> 2371.04
england

2372.079 --> 2377.3590000000004
took it away like separate and said like

2374.56 --> 2379.92
no we're going to now be like a mini

2377.359 --> 2381.92
pope in a way like we have to translate

2379.92 --> 2383.839
and they wouldn't have spread it around

2381.92 --> 2386.7200000000003
or maybe he did

2383.839 --> 2389.44
maybe really gave christianity to the

2386.72 --> 2391.2
public i don't know how wide

2389.44 --> 2392.88
it's probably king james or something

2391.2 --> 2396.0
right

2392.88 --> 2398.6400000000003
i don't know how open about it he was

2396.0 --> 2401.2
but such a maneuver was definitely about

2398.64 --> 2403.52
taking the

2401.2 --> 2405.2799999999997
the monopoly power of the knowledge of

2403.52 --> 2408.839
it away from

2405.28 --> 2408.8390000000004
the the papacy

2411.92 --> 2417.359
because they were abusing it very

2414.319 --> 2420.0
blatantly more and worse

2417.359 --> 2420.0
over time

2420.4 --> 2427.92
just pure paul they like they were like

2424.72 --> 2430.16
papacy like in the beginning it wasn't

2427.92 --> 2433.839
all that terrible

2430.16 --> 2436.0789999999997
but it just became more liberal

2433.839 --> 2438.16
type that sort of corruption just

2436.079 --> 2440.5600000000004
happened more and more more power

2438.16 --> 2442.72
corruption more

2440.56 --> 2444.4
just

2442.72 --> 2447.04
egotistical

2444.4 --> 2447.04
sadistic

2447.839 --> 2453.119
devilish

2449.2 --> 2454.7999999999997
more of that over time

2453.119 --> 2456.8
and then yeah the only way to take that

2454.8 --> 2458.88
away is by taking away their monopoly

2456.8 --> 2461.04
power over the information

2458.88 --> 2463.119
decentralizing the book and that's why

2461.04 --> 2466.68
they all did it

2463.119 --> 2466.6800000000003
it's a good thing

2477.599 --> 2481.52
latin and french common language amongst

2479.839 --> 2483.359
the elite yeah that's right that's what

2481.52 --> 2486.96
i said

2483.359 --> 2489.2799999999997
it wasn't a commoner skill it was for

2486.96 --> 2490.8
nobility and all that

2489.28 --> 2494.119
the elites

2490.8 --> 2494.119
that's right

2498.72 --> 2504.839
you don't think rome would have been

2500.48 --> 2504.839
arbiters of the written word

2508.0 --> 2510.64
what do you mean

2510.88 --> 2515.6800000000003
i'm pretty sure they were

2512.88 --> 2518.88
i mean what the people learned about

2515.68 --> 2520.56
jesus christ and the bible was literally

2518.88 --> 2521.359
what the priests

2520.56 --> 2523.52
would

2521.359 --> 2525.359
tell them

2523.52 --> 2527.839
they wouldn't be able to actually look

2525.359 --> 2529.68
over their shoulder in their in the book

2527.839 --> 2532.0
if they were even actually saying

2529.68 --> 2532.8799999999997
anything from the book

2532.0 --> 2536.56
yeah

2532.88 --> 2539.2000000000003
back then papacy wouldn't be like oh

2536.56 --> 2542.0
number this that corinthians or what

2539.2 --> 2544.16
note they would just say whatever they

2542.0 --> 2546.56
wanted to say

2544.16 --> 2548.0789999999997
they weren't teaching people about the

2546.56 --> 2552.319
book

2548.079 --> 2552.319
they were just using their authority

2552.88 --> 2557.76
under the guise of the book a lot right

2556.0 --> 2562.599
that's the political power that they

2557.76 --> 2562.599
really use that's the theocracy power

2568.24 --> 2572.9599999999996
no that's not what the papacy it's duh

2571.92 --> 2575.599
my god

2572.96 --> 2578.319
it's like politics

2575.599 --> 2581.44
like i mean seriously in a political

2578.319 --> 2584.24
system it's not like the president that

2581.44 --> 2586.319
literally tells every single person in

2584.24 --> 2588.4799999999996
their cabinet exactly what to do that's

2586.319 --> 2591.04
not how that works and neither did it

2588.48 --> 2594.56
with the papacy

2591.04 --> 2596.88
that it's about the way they do their

2594.56 --> 2599.44
things towards the public

2596.88 --> 2601.599
not about a singular person telling

2599.44 --> 2605.319
everybody exactly what to say that's not

2601.599 --> 2605.319
what i was talking about

2608.46 --> 2611.659
[Music]

2616.56 --> 2619.56
hmm

2620.56 --> 2624.159
[Music]

2628.24 --> 2631.24
what

2636.72 --> 2640.24
okay interesting boris boy

2643.54 --> 2646.639
[Music]

2646.72 --> 2651.4399999999996
okay how long what how long does that

2649.28 --> 2654.1600000000003
exist was that something they

2651.44 --> 2654.16
always did

2655.359 --> 2658.72
or is that more recent type of

2657.44 --> 2660.4
development

2658.72 --> 2662.7999999999997
because i mean the catholic church is

2660.4 --> 2665.359
gone it's gone through a whole bunch of

2662.8 --> 2668.8
developments

2665.359 --> 2669.7599999999998
in power not in power

2668.8 --> 2672.319
right

2669.76 --> 2674.5600000000004
the thing is that they're always they're

2672.319 --> 2677.04
always getting involved in change of

2674.56 --> 2679.68
things always right they literally

2677.04 --> 2682.319
introduced the heliocentric model that

2679.68 --> 2685.04
was the catholic church

2682.319 --> 2686.8
all of the people that did that were all

2685.04 --> 2691.72
part of it

2686.8 --> 2691.7200000000003
jesuit or just catholic priest

2691.76 --> 2695.599
so

2693.839 --> 2698.48
catholic

2695.599 --> 2702.96
organization was always in getting

2698.48 --> 2704.56
involved in weird changes always

2702.96 --> 2707.839
they were wizards

2704.56 --> 2709.44
literally wizards

2707.839 --> 2713.119
wizards

2709.44 --> 2713.119
pretending to be a priesthood

2714.72 --> 2718.48
[Music]

2716.64 --> 2721.04
and some of them

2718.48 --> 2722.16
would would be actual priests and they

2721.04 --> 2724.0
would know

2722.16 --> 2726.0789999999997
like yeah this is actually more like a

2724.0 --> 2728.48
wizard

2726.079 --> 2732.92
wizards guild

2728.48 --> 2732.92
but we do have actual priests

2733.119 --> 2738.319
that is not entirely true i mean

2735.76 --> 2740.8
a lot of them it's a big organization

2738.319 --> 2742.64
and they would have had a lot of genuine

2740.8 --> 2744.88
priests

2742.64 --> 2746.8799999999997
but yeah definitely wizards among them

2744.88 --> 2749.92
that were playing these games and

2746.88 --> 2752.92
political games and mind control

2749.92 --> 2752.92
experiments

2793.599 --> 2799.8
you'll find it interesting that the

2794.8 --> 2799.8
quran hasn't changed yeah that's good

2803.2 --> 2808.7999999999997
yeah and the bible is a mess

2805.599 --> 2811.3590000000004
it is it has become a mess

2808.8 --> 2814.8390000000004
it's been culturally influenced

2811.359 --> 2814.839
in many ways

2830.319 --> 2834.48
what i've been wondering is

2832.64 --> 2838.72
was there like a

2834.48 --> 2838.72
pre nicean council bible

2840.64 --> 2846.4
is there still some copy of it

2843.68 --> 2846.3999999999996
hidden away

2846.559 --> 2850.0
that's like ancient by now

2850.16 --> 2853.68
because yeah

2851.76 --> 2855.5200000000004
they probably did destroy all

2853.68 --> 2858.5589999999997
competition basically in order to

2855.52 --> 2861.04
manifest the bible

2858.559 --> 2863.2000000000003
they claimed it

2861.04 --> 2865.2799999999997
it's part of the theocracy

2863.2 --> 2867.2799999999997
and they destroyed

2865.28 --> 2869.6800000000003
old

2867.28 --> 2874.0
churches like the old

2869.68 --> 2875.9199999999996
christ church the christian movement

2874.0 --> 2878.079
that might have even preceded

2875.92 --> 2880.559
christianity or i mean

2878.079 --> 2882.96
jesus christ himself that's it gets

2880.559 --> 2886.1600000000003
complicated

2882.96 --> 2889.44
but it's widely known or deduced that

2886.16 --> 2893.44
they destroyed it catholics destroyed

2889.44 --> 2893.44
the other christian churches

2899.599 --> 2905.3590000000004
so i'm wondering like was there

2902.16 --> 2907.2799999999997
a pretty nice sea in bible

2905.359 --> 2909.52
what would it what would it have been

2907.28 --> 2909.52
like

2909.839 --> 2913.359
i mean that would have been pretty

2911.119 --> 2916.2400000000002
remarkable it would probably remind

2913.359 --> 2920.48
people more like about

2916.24 --> 2920.4799999999996
like the style of the quran perhaps

2922.079 --> 2925.559
just yeah

2928.24 --> 2933.2799999999997
who knows what's going to happen maybe

2930.0 --> 2934.079
maybe a book like that will be found

2933.28 --> 2935.6800000000003
or

2934.079 --> 2937.44
come afloat maybe it's already been

2935.68 --> 2939.839
found for like 100 years and they're

2937.44 --> 2940.839
just waiting for the right moment to

2939.839 --> 2942.5589999999997
to do

2940.839 --> 2944.88
that

2942.559 --> 2947.2000000000003
do you think the holy grail is real and

2944.88 --> 2948.8
hidden away no

2947.2 --> 2951.52
it's all symbolic

2948.8 --> 2954.1600000000003
like holy grail is esoteric like that's

2951.52 --> 2956.8
never literal

2954.16 --> 2960.64
right and most of these events even that

2956.8 --> 2961.76
are described in utter detail

2960.64 --> 2963.2799999999997
of

2961.76 --> 2965.8390000000004
the book

2963.28 --> 2968.4
i don't think they're real they're

2965.839 --> 2970.5589999999997
esoteric symbols that have been woven

2968.4 --> 2973.04
into us the story

2970.559 --> 2976.079
right because the entire story

2973.04 --> 2977.359
is like a theatrical replay of real

2976.079 --> 2980.0
events

2977.359 --> 2983.4
but with the symbols and the esoterics

2980.0 --> 2983.4
woven in

2987.04 --> 2991.2799999999997
yeah in that sense i'm absolutely not a

2989.359 --> 2993.92
bible literalist

2991.28 --> 2996.4
although knowing it literally

2993.92 --> 2999.04
does help understand the esoterics

2996.4 --> 3004.2000000000003
better if you then

2999.04 --> 3004.2
are able to yeah allow that in

3022.48 --> 3027.839
the church was formed but no he wasn't

3024.319 --> 3027.839
no it's not true

3028.0 --> 3031.52
it's not the catholic church

3032.16 --> 3035.48
word is boy

3044.4 --> 3047.92
right

3046.079 --> 3052.48
but yeah

3047.92 --> 3055.76
i think the holy grail it being a cup

3052.48 --> 3058.16
water being involved eternal life

3055.76 --> 3062.6400000000003
it seems very likely that the holy grail

3058.16 --> 3065.68
is literally the symbol or a womb

3062.64 --> 3067.7599999999998
and that eternal life or the internal

3065.68 --> 3072.7599999999998
continuation of life

3067.76 --> 3072.76
is found in the womb basically

3094.079 --> 3097.079
oops

3100.96 --> 3105.2400000000002
i don't know what that word even means

3136.16 --> 3140.96
like who came up with that word man

3138.48 --> 3145.2400000000002
that's not natural that there's no

3140.96 --> 3145.2400000000002
normal way to pronounce that

3158.16 --> 3163.839
oh right it's a reference to the last

3161.359 --> 3163.839
supper

3164.839 --> 3169.2799999999997
thing the bread and the wine

3168.24 --> 3170.4799999999996
to symbolize the

3169.28 --> 3172.4
[Music]

3170.48 --> 3175.92
flesh and the blood

3172.4 --> 3175.92
what do i think about it

3177.44 --> 3181.2400000000002
i think it's

3178.839 --> 3183.04
weird it's almost like

3181.24 --> 3185.5989999999997
anthropomorphizing but it's that's not

3183.04 --> 3187.2
the right word it's just making it

3185.599 --> 3190.7200000000003
solid

3187.2 --> 3194.68
when it is obviously purely about energy

3190.72 --> 3194.68
esoterics right

3200.8 --> 3204.8
or it would have been referencing

3204.88 --> 3209.839
yeah

3205.68 --> 3209.839
some weird ancient ancient tradition

3210.64 --> 3214.48
where if you like if somebody yeah

3212.559 --> 3215.28
cannibalism

3214.48 --> 3217.839
right

3215.28 --> 3221.2000000000003
but a very specific type

3217.839 --> 3224.0
is like ritual cannibalism

3221.2 --> 3225.9199999999996
not like oh ooga-booga a strange human

3224.0 --> 3227.44
came wondering if we kill them and eat

3225.92 --> 3229.6800000000003
them

3227.44 --> 3232.319
no not like that not like

3229.68 --> 3234.48
for your common food like ritual

3232.319 --> 3235.599
cannibalism

3234.48 --> 3236.88
right

3235.599 --> 3239.44
where

3236.88 --> 3242.88
a revered person

3239.44 --> 3245.119
when they died for some reason

3242.88 --> 3247.76
like even even from old age right so

3245.119 --> 3249.92
it's not about oh juicy meat no it's not

3247.76 --> 3251.92
about that it's not about physical

3249.92 --> 3256.079
nutrient it would be

3251.92 --> 3259.52
believed that yeah if you ate the flesh

3256.079 --> 3262.2400000000002
of a revered person

3259.52 --> 3264.8
that you would get part of their spirit

3262.24 --> 3267.2
with you

3264.8 --> 3269.119
that they would come with you right

3267.2 --> 3269.9199999999996
and yeah

3269.119 --> 3271.599
that

3269.92 --> 3272.359
thinking structure

3271.599 --> 3275.3590000000004
is

3272.359 --> 3279.119
vastly spread

3275.359 --> 3280.4
like people in the jungle

3279.119 --> 3282.48
that are

3280.4 --> 3284.559
that do allow like cannibalism they

3282.48 --> 3286.48
believe that

3284.559 --> 3288.96
a lot of them

3286.48 --> 3292.16
right so it's not about oh just

3288.96 --> 3294.48
kill animal eat it oh kill human eat it

3292.16 --> 3296.3999999999996
like a predator that's just

3294.48 --> 3298.559
hungry and wants to eat everything no

3296.4 --> 3302.1600000000003
it's specifically

3298.559 --> 3304.079
about a weird spirit ritual

3302.16 --> 3307.52
and it exists and there might be

3304.079 --> 3309.92
something to it it is still very gross

3307.52 --> 3313.68
i agree seeking sterile water i don't

3309.92 --> 3313.6800000000003
exactly like the idea either

3314.88 --> 3320.7200000000003
but that may be what it might yeah that

3317.68 --> 3321.7599999999998
might be what it's referencing to

3320.72 --> 3324.3999999999996
and

3321.76 --> 3326.48
yeah then here goes the thing

3324.4 --> 3328.079
so what if it works are we going to do

3326.48 --> 3329.76
it because it works

3328.079 --> 3331.92
or

3329.76 --> 3335.8390000000004
doesn't it work anymore because we're

3331.92 --> 3335.839
now in an age where it's just too gross

3341.119 --> 3346.799
right maybe it is it stems that effect

3344.4 --> 3349.44
stems from a time

3346.799 --> 3351.28
where humans had a lot more trouble to

3349.44 --> 3355.68
survive

3351.28 --> 3355.6800000000003
and it was like really important

3355.76 --> 3359.5200000000004
to survive

3358.0 --> 3362.64
so that would you would take great

3359.52 --> 3365.2
measures right you would like get a wife

3362.64 --> 3366.5589999999997
that might be eight or something

3365.2 --> 3369.4399999999996
because

3366.559 --> 3371.52
you needed that survive not to squirt

3369.44 --> 3373.2000000000003
all day it's you needed that survival

3371.52 --> 3375.359
and maybe they would eat

3373.2 --> 3377.68
their revered people

3375.359 --> 3379.44
desperately trying to hold on to their

3377.68 --> 3381.359
wisdom and remember like they really

3379.44 --> 3384.079
wanted that and they needed it they

3381.359 --> 3387.359
needed that inspiration because life was

3384.079 --> 3387.3590000000004
actually really tough

3389.04 --> 3393.92
and there will probably be more

3390.88 --> 3395.599
dangerous and more wild animals

3393.92 --> 3397.44
and just

3395.599 --> 3401.4
all kinds of tribes that would always be

3397.44 --> 3401.4
hostile against one another

3406.559 --> 3410.7200000000003
i don't think kind of a new guinea had

3408.4 --> 3414.559
yeah i do think that

3410.72 --> 3414.5589999999997
metal slugs cockatoo i think that

3414.64 --> 3420.48
most cannibals had that element to it

3418.4 --> 3423.28
and i think that the people that

3420.48 --> 3426.0
basically came in from the west

3423.28 --> 3427.8390000000004
with their civilized notions just didn't

3426.0 --> 3430.16
recognize it for what it was and just

3427.839 --> 3431.119
thought like oh my god these people just

3430.16 --> 3433.52
grab

3431.119 --> 3435.92
people from the wilds and then just

3433.52 --> 3438.4
roast them to eat them they

3435.92 --> 3440.079
didn't understand they didn't understand

3438.4 --> 3441.6800000000003
what it was actually what they're

3440.079 --> 3444.2400000000002
actually doing

3441.68 --> 3446.64
and i mean yeah if you then as an

3444.24 --> 3448.72
outsider start killing the tribe

3446.64 --> 3450.4
because like oh my god they eat people

3448.72 --> 3452.0
kill them yeah

3450.4 --> 3453.839
then

3452.0 --> 3456.4
it will be a whole nother story and then

3453.839 --> 3458.5589999999997
those tribesmen would probably like oh

3456.4 --> 3461.2000000000003
really or you're just gonna attack us

3458.559 --> 3464.88
just like okay well then we are going to

3461.2 --> 3466.5589999999997
eat you and we're going to eat your soul

3464.88 --> 3468.4
right

3466.559 --> 3469.76
and then things would just yeah let's be

3468.4 --> 3471.92
war

3469.76 --> 3471.92
so

3472.4 --> 3476.88
yeah by the way it's kind of weird that

3474.96 --> 3482.0
that subject's coming up

3476.88 --> 3482.0
i did watch a movie yesterday on netflix

3483.04 --> 3490.48
and then it had it actually came

3486.839 --> 3492.48
like that subject came past literally

3490.48 --> 3493.599
with like indians

3492.48 --> 3496.079
in

3493.599 --> 3498.1600000000003
south america

3496.079 --> 3499.3590000000004
and they were literally eating an old

3498.16 --> 3501.1189999999997
person

3499.359 --> 3502.96
that had died that they all respected

3501.119 --> 3505.92
and they wanted the soul and yeah that

3502.96 --> 3505.92
was explained even

3506.64 --> 3512.64
right uh that movie by the way was uh

3510.0 --> 3512.64
the name

3513.599 --> 3520.559
like the lost city of zee it was a

3517.2 --> 3524.24
supposedly a historical movie

3520.559 --> 3524.2400000000002
about a british explorer

3524.4 --> 3528.839
that was looking around

3527.599 --> 3531.599
in south

3528.839 --> 3535.04
america trying to find

3531.599 --> 3538.319
what what he called the lost city of zee

3535.04 --> 3542.079
and was like pretty much eldorado

3538.319 --> 3544.319
but like with more historical interest

3542.079 --> 3545.3590000000004
so i watched that yesterday and was like

3544.319 --> 3547.839
very

3545.359 --> 3547.839
impressed

3555.68 --> 3560.0789999999997
great

3557.839 --> 3564.64
something interesting but you watch it

3560.079 --> 3567.76
through and then you can find it back

3564.64 --> 3567.7599999999998
so netflix

3568.559 --> 3575.28
it's like i've just watched it yeah oh

3571.2 --> 3576.77
yeah now you can't find it anymore

3575.28 --> 3579.94
hello kitty

3576.77 --> 3579.94
[Music]

3583.73 --> 3588.7400000000002
[Music]

3585.76 --> 3591.92
just try to find it in imdb

3588.74 --> 3591.9199999999996
[Music]

3607.44 --> 3614.4
yeah it is called lost city from 2016

3612.319 --> 3616.64
it also has a

3614.4 --> 3619.28
a minor role

3616.64 --> 3622.4
but like the same actor that plays like

3619.28 --> 3625.28
this spider-man

3622.4 --> 3627.359
like the newer the newer guy

3625.28 --> 3629.28
i think he's pretty awesome as a as an

3627.359 --> 3631.839
actor he is usually pretty awesome

3629.28 --> 3631.8390000000004
characters

3632.4 --> 3638.0
but like this is a historical themed

3635.599 --> 3638.0
movie

3638.16 --> 3642.2799999999997
like they took it very serious

3642.319 --> 3647.92
to get the style right so it's like very

3644.72 --> 3650.0789999999997
early 20th century

3647.92 --> 3652.4
check it out it look it is definitely

3650.079 --> 3655.44
worth a watch

3652.4 --> 3658.559
it is it is purely about exploration the

3655.44 --> 3661.839
hazard of exploration the pressure and

3658.559 --> 3665.44
the circumstances of this of the time

3661.839 --> 3670.0
i was really impressed by this movie

3665.44 --> 3670.0
and it's on netflix so it'd be easy to

3670.33 --> 3675.44
[Music]

3673.2 --> 3675.4399999999996
what

3676.72 --> 3681.4399999999996
no no rufus inhabits

3680.559 --> 3683.52
i

3681.44 --> 3686.079
i don't know what it is exactly i've

3683.52 --> 3689.359
heard of it but i know even by the name

3686.079 --> 3692.4
that i would never take that

3689.359 --> 3695.44
yeah i don't take pharmaceuticals like

3692.4 --> 3695.44
that ever

3695.52 --> 3699.119
yeah

3696.48 --> 3701.359
never

3699.119 --> 3704.359
you understand that rufus and hubbens

3701.359 --> 3704.359
never

3722.0 --> 3725.68
in christianity you have the symbolism

3723.839 --> 3726.96
of eating body of christ and drinking

3725.68 --> 3731.1189999999997
yeah

3726.96 --> 3734.0
pgcnet so what i'm saying is this stems

3731.119 --> 3737.039
from what probably is a very very

3734.0 --> 3740.96
ancient practice it's like a symbolic

3737.039 --> 3744.7200000000003
remnant of a very ancient practice

3740.96 --> 3749.88
that is now looked down upon

3744.72 --> 3749.8799999999997
by the modern collective spirit

3754.16 --> 3758.8799999999997
and arguably and i've heard other people

3757.119 --> 3762.48
argue this

3758.88 --> 3765.52
they did it like oh take the little

3762.48 --> 3767.2
red sort of thingy and the water as the

3765.52 --> 3768.96
blood and the

3767.2 --> 3771.4399999999996
flesh of christ

3768.96 --> 3775.44
it is arguably that they did that

3771.44 --> 3775.44
specifically to replace

3775.76 --> 3781.039
another habit where they would probably

3778.0 --> 3786.4
actually do it with human beings at the

3781.039 --> 3788.7990000000004
time like pretty more savage pagani

3786.4 --> 3792.559
i didn't maybe at the time there were

3788.799 --> 3794.319
just groups that were by like old habits

3792.559 --> 3795.6800000000003
and they couldn't be talked out of it

3794.319 --> 3797.359
easily

3795.68 --> 3799.359
that they would even like sacrifice

3797.359 --> 3803.0389999999998
children and just

3799.359 --> 3805.839
have everybody eat them

3803.039 --> 3808.559
as a ritual or something some sounds

3805.839 --> 3810.48
super gruesome right well

3808.559 --> 3813.119
who knows what was going on back then

3810.48 --> 3815.2
and yeah arguably

3813.119 --> 3818.2400000000002
the catholic church might have like

3815.2 --> 3820.72
tried to talk them out of doing that by

3818.24 --> 3822.0789999999997
giving them a substitute ritual saying

3820.72 --> 3824.3999999999996
just no no just

3822.079 --> 3825.92
do it symbolically don't actually do it

3824.4 --> 3828.799
it's a sin

3825.92 --> 3831.28
and yeah good point you know

3828.799 --> 3833.7599999999998
but it is like political meddling in a

3831.28 --> 3836.0
way with the spirit with spiritual

3833.76 --> 3838.96
matters

3836.0 --> 3842.0
that's what i think too

3838.96 --> 3844.64
that it was introduced to not

3842.0 --> 3847.68
secretly hide

3844.64 --> 3849.7599999999998
dark pagan practices or something

3847.68 --> 3853.5989999999997
but it was originally put there as a

3849.76 --> 3855.76
maneuver to end those pagan practices to

3853.599 --> 3859.2000000000003
replace it

3855.76 --> 3859.2000000000003
i agree with that notion

3861.039 --> 3864.1600000000003
i mean

3862.0 --> 3866.72
catholic church was really trying to

3864.16 --> 3870.48
unify it all right it was trying to like

3866.72 --> 3871.52
make a pagan christianity thing

3870.48 --> 3873.68
when

3871.52 --> 3876.079
they were actually kind of counter

3873.68 --> 3878.16
opposite in many ways

3876.079 --> 3880.4
so it's really difficult to then

3878.16 --> 3881.92
integrate that

3880.4 --> 3884.0
and

3881.92 --> 3885.6800000000003
well they've took it to take an enormous

3884.0 --> 3887.44
effort to do it

3885.68 --> 3888.96
at least right

3887.44 --> 3890.96
whether it's a good thing or how

3888.96 --> 3893.359
successful it is is another matter but

3890.96 --> 3896.559
they've made a lot of effort

3893.359 --> 3896.5589999999997
you have to give it to them

3896.75 --> 3900.0
[Music]

3898.079 --> 3902.1600000000003
do you think they found the lost city at

3900.0 --> 3904.559
the end of the movie oh flatter sage

3902.16 --> 3904.5589999999997
dude

3904.88 --> 3909.839
did you know that they never found their

3907.039 --> 3909.8390000000004
bodies right

3910.24 --> 3914.319
so

3911.76 --> 3916.6400000000003
and they didn't suggest it you know what

3914.319 --> 3919.119
i think in my fantasy that is my

3916.64 --> 3920.319
fantastical response

3919.119 --> 3923.599
is

3920.319 --> 3926.079
what if they were actually

3923.599 --> 3929.92
since they were recognized by the local

3926.079 --> 3931.119
people there very seriously as explorers

3929.92 --> 3934.0
well what

3931.119 --> 3937.119
if there was another secret

3934.0 --> 3941.28
yeah what if the supposed lost city of z

3937.119 --> 3943.2000000000003
was actually a giant tunnel

3941.28 --> 3946.88
like there was a

3943.2 --> 3948.48
a gateway a giant staircase to another

3946.88 --> 3950.6400000000003
to shale

3948.48 --> 3952.64
right what if they were led like

3950.64 --> 3955.52
you want to explore

3952.64 --> 3958.72
here is another realm

3955.52 --> 3960.72
and we trust you

3958.72 --> 3963.2
you're allowed to go there and that they

3960.72 --> 3965.2
went to like through the staircase to

3963.2 --> 3966.96
the other realm or something

3965.2 --> 3969.2799999999997
that will be a good reason never to be

3966.96 --> 3971.44
found again if you know what i mean

3969.28 --> 3975.039
especially if it's like hidden by the

3971.44 --> 3975.039
locals and how to get there

3975.2 --> 3979.2799999999997
that you really can't find it without

3977.039 --> 3981.3590000000004
them

3979.28 --> 3982.88
right so that was my fantastical

3981.359 --> 3985.359
response like why would they never been

3982.88 --> 3988.0
found not even a skeleton or anything

3985.359 --> 3989.44
well maybe because they literally

3988.0 --> 3990.72
went there

3989.44 --> 3992.96
to the

3990.72 --> 3996.319
the doorway also suggesting that the

3992.96 --> 3999.119
ancient city of zee was like the entry

3996.319 --> 4001.359
for these old

3999.119 --> 4004.2400000000002
yeah the very ancient people that they

4001.359 --> 4006.64
came out of the ground there from

4004.24 --> 4009.0389999999998
another realm

4006.64 --> 4010.72
and entered this realm

4009.039 --> 4012.0
and that the staircase might still be

4010.72 --> 4013.839
there

4012.0 --> 4015.76
that's what i thought about it they

4013.839 --> 4017.119
didn't give a direct suggestion about it

4015.76 --> 4019.28
but that's

4017.119 --> 4021.839
definitely on my mind at the end of the

4019.28 --> 4021.8390000000004
movie

4022.7 --> 4027.9399999999996
[Music]

4034.64 --> 4040.24
hello

4036.799 --> 4040.24
metal slugs cocktail

4042.16 --> 4045.48
psych bear

4052.64 --> 4057.44
i was given a prescription as it did

4054.72 --> 4057.4399999999996
after yeah

4057.52 --> 4062.48
yeah don't take it why the hell would

4059.28 --> 4064.079
you take it rufus why why would you take

4062.48 --> 4068.079
it's math

4064.079 --> 4069.76
you realize it is basically math

4068.079 --> 4073.7200000000003
why are you letting your doctor

4069.76 --> 4073.7200000000003
prescribe you math

4076.799 --> 4082.48
i mean

4078.48 --> 4082.48
what's the reason you're even taking it

4082.72 --> 4086.9199999999996
what's the suggested reason

4095.2 --> 4098.4
yeah that's right sidebear

4102.719 --> 4104.96
the

4112.21 --> 4117.81
[Music]

4118.56 --> 4122.4800000000005
trouble trying to understand what you're

4120.239 --> 4126.159
talking about

4122.48 --> 4126.159
and i'm running out of time damn it

4126.719 --> 4130.159
yeah

4127.839 --> 4131.92
because that movie really was the thing

4130.159 --> 4134.159
that i wanted to talk about i really

4131.92 --> 4135.279
like the movie i like the actors in the

4134.159 --> 4137.12
movie

4135.279 --> 4140.64
they had like this

4137.12 --> 4143.679
mega gamma in there at some point

4140.64 --> 4146.2390000000005
exactly the way you would expect it like

4143.679 --> 4147.759
the ultimate gamma there was like this

4146.239 --> 4148.639999999999
kind of sort of

4147.759 --> 4150.88
guy

4148.64 --> 4155.1990000000005
from a from a secret society group or

4150.88 --> 4158.159000000001
something which is a cartography society

4155.199 --> 4161.12
just smoky room people

4158.159 --> 4163.199
and he sort of like was

4161.12 --> 4164.799
challenging the main character to go

4163.199 --> 4166.48
there and he went with him and then he

4164.799 --> 4169.359
was literally

4166.48 --> 4172.4
whining and complaining

4169.359 --> 4175.6
and backstabbing and going nuts

4172.4 --> 4179.679
from the stress all the time even like

4175.6 --> 4182.88
sabotaging like that character is like

4179.679 --> 4185.759
perfect that's like the ultimate gamma

4182.88 --> 4187.839
it was such a perfect gamma character in

4185.759 --> 4189.759
that like i'm really impressed by this

4187.839 --> 4192.12
movie i recommend you watch this movie

4189.759 --> 4198.28
it's awesome

4192.12 --> 4198.28
2016 lost city of sea it's awesome

4202.88 --> 4208.0
recommend it as a cure-all

4206.32 --> 4210.4
cognitive material

4208.0 --> 4210.4
dude

4211.6 --> 4214.88
well if you're having weight problems

4213.92 --> 4218.64
yeah

4214.88 --> 4218.64
you know that's typically

4218.88 --> 4223.92
what you take meth for because you start

4221.52 --> 4226.8
you get active and then you burn fat the

4223.92 --> 4229.52
problem is though is that

4226.8 --> 4232.159000000001
you're gonna turn into a math addict

4229.52 --> 4232.159000000001
you will

4232.56 --> 4236.320000000001
yeah you understand what that means

4236.48 --> 4241.12
look

4237.44 --> 4242.4
into math addiction

4241.12 --> 4247.12
and then

4242.4 --> 4248.799999999999
make a judgment call do you want to risk

4247.12 --> 4251.12
falling into that

4248.8 --> 4253.360000000001
or maybe there's a better way of doing

4251.12 --> 4253.36
this

4254.88 --> 4260.0
yeah i know somebody that

4257.679 --> 4262.56
like has

4260.0 --> 4266.4
meth addiction problems and they're like

4262.56 --> 4268.719
really staying off it but the problems

4266.4 --> 4271.04
they don't really go away i've noticed

4268.719 --> 4272.88
with some people i wouldn't want to risk

4271.04 --> 4274.32
that

4272.88 --> 4277.28
this isn't about getting it doesn't

4274.32 --> 4280.159
matter if it's about getting high or not

4277.28 --> 4282.08
you get addicted to it

4280.159 --> 4285.599999999999
this is not about pleasure drug

4282.08 --> 4289.76
addiction it's about physical addiction

4285.6 --> 4293.04
it does something to your system rufus

4289.76 --> 4293.04
it changes your brain

4294.0 --> 4298.96
and if you yeah losing your teeth well

4295.76 --> 4298.96
that happens if you like

4299.679 --> 4304.4
smoke it or like if you really get to

4302.239 --> 4306.159
meth addiction

4304.4 --> 4307.12
don't just lose your teeth from the

4306.159 --> 4309.199
pills

4307.12 --> 4311.44
but you can by the way dumb damage your

4309.199 --> 4314.44
stomach if you do it too much

4311.44 --> 4314.44
so

4315.12 --> 4319.48
very careful about it rufus

4337.84 --> 4345.04
no no it is math rufus it is

4343.28 --> 4347.28
and that your

4345.04 --> 4349.679
hazard like you're avoiding to call it

4347.28 --> 4352.48
that is already a sign that's that's a

4349.679 --> 4352.4800000000005
troublesome sign

4352.96 --> 4355.76
it doesn't matter if it's a moderate

4354.719 --> 4358.4
form

4355.76 --> 4361.12
it is that it is the substance it's that

4358.4 --> 4363.5199999999995
chemical it's going to do the same thing

4361.12 --> 4365.36
to you maybe a little slower but it is

4363.52 --> 4367.6
going to do it to you

4365.36 --> 4367.599999999999
okay

4368.719 --> 4372.4
look it up look

4370.4 --> 4375.12
up

4372.4 --> 4377.599999999999
not like horus but look up just general

4375.12 --> 4382.4
problems with the use

4377.6 --> 4382.400000000001
of meth or meth related drugs

4382.719 --> 4388.0
what the typical issues will be because

4385.12 --> 4390.4
you will have the signs it is something

4388.0 --> 4392.719
is going to happen

4390.4 --> 4394.719
there's literally nobody in this world

4392.719 --> 4395.76
that can take meth

4394.719 --> 4399.199
and then

4395.76 --> 4401.360000000001
have no side effects if they keep taking

4399.199 --> 4404.5599999999995
they don't exist okay

4401.36 --> 4404.5599999999995
so be aware of that

4408.56 --> 4414.080000000001
not taking the meth no that doesn't

4411.679 --> 4415.52
matter it doesn't matter if it's that

4414.08 --> 4417.6
form

4415.52 --> 4418.56
it's still gonna do the same things to

4417.6 --> 4420.2390000000005
you

4418.56 --> 4422.719
it doesn't matter if it's like the

4420.239 --> 4424.0
concentrated drug

4422.719 --> 4426.0
or not

4424.0 --> 4427.52
it's the same substance it's the same

4426.0 --> 4430.0
chemical

4427.52 --> 4433.719
effect on you

4430.0 --> 4433.719
it's gonna do that

4448.239 --> 4451.5199999999995
made in the lab now to do his bathtub

4450.159 --> 4452.639999999999
right

4451.52 --> 4454.8
i mean

4452.64 --> 4456.4800000000005
the pharmaceutical stuff is gonna have

4454.8 --> 4458.56
less

4456.48 --> 4460.959999999999
poison in it i guess

4458.56 --> 4463.6
the substance still gonna do what it's

4460.96 --> 4467.199
gonna do to you okay

4463.6 --> 4469.84
it will still change your brain

4467.199 --> 4472.0
like the way you compose yourself the

4469.84 --> 4473.6
way you start to think it does that i've

4472.0 --> 4476.239
seen it happen

4473.6 --> 4479.4400000000005
people that are seriously addicted they

4476.239 --> 4481.28
all know it they know that that has

4479.44 --> 4483.28
happened to them

4481.28 --> 4485.04
it's very hard to avoid

4483.28 --> 4487.28
or to deny

4485.04 --> 4488.4
anyway i'm gonna round out the show dude

4487.28 --> 4489.36
