7.82 --> 37.71
[Music]

69.979 --> 72.979
hmm

73.34 --> 78.26
good morning welcome to flattered early

76.74 --> 82.02
bird number

78.26 --> 83.64
1473 I'm your host Arwin and before I

82.02 --> 86.759
start the show please don't forget to

83.64 --> 89.159
share it on any platform medium fit and

86.759 --> 91.56
if you haven't already subscribe to my

89.159 --> 93.78
channel and hit the Bell notification so

91.56 --> 96.36
you know when I'm going live which is

93.78 --> 98.88
normally 1pm Amsterdam time in weekdays

96.36 --> 101.52
and 2PM Amsterdam time in the weekend

98.88 --> 103.67999999999999
and please also do support me through

101.52 --> 106.67999999999999
the PayPal patreon and the membership

103.68 --> 108.18
system join button they'll be much

106.68 --> 112.86000000000001
appreciated

108.18 --> 116.18
and yeah I can sure use support it's

112.86 --> 116.17999999999999
been a full week

117.899 --> 120.43900000000001
so

121.38 --> 129.47899999999998
right anyway the weather today

125.479 --> 133.379
it's kind of surprisingly clear

129.479 --> 135.959
and then they literally kept yeah pretty

133.379 --> 138.42
sure that they trailed the [ __ ] out of

135.959 --> 141.42000000000002
the sky I mean they literally left grit

138.42 --> 145.07999999999998
patterns and now it's all hazy

141.42 --> 148.44
because just one hour ago that was

145.08 --> 152.0
perfect blue pristine sky

148.44 --> 152.0
so I'm kind of pissed off

153.48 --> 157.44
because it was actually a really

155.28 --> 162.44
beautiful day

157.44 --> 162.44
until they did that and I don't know why

163.8 --> 170.48000000000002
I mean haven't we had enough

166.739 --> 170.48000000000002
freaking gray weather already

182.459 --> 185.06
anyway

190.56 --> 196.92000000000002
right it's Friday the 6th of January

193.92 --> 196.92
2023

199.319 --> 205.879
right

201.42 --> 205.879
I got it title but

206.4 --> 210.78
we'll see if I'm actually gonna talk

208.56 --> 215.459
about that

210.78 --> 218.879
because it you literally can't talk I

215.459 --> 221.34
can barely I would barely be able to

218.879 --> 224.34
talk about it if I didn't have somebody

221.34 --> 227.879
to reflect upon

224.34 --> 230.879
because it's kind of heavily ethereal or

227.879 --> 230.879
esoteric

231.36 --> 237.959
right because everybody can stare at

234.42 --> 240.78
numbers and go geometry on them

237.959 --> 243.14000000000001
but what about the things that aren't

240.78 --> 243.14000000000001
numbers

243.18 --> 249.36
but that are still reoccurring patterns

247.56 --> 252.84
you know

249.36 --> 255.06
you're just not you're not gonna allow

252.84 --> 257.519
some kind of structural

255.06 --> 260.579
oversight over that you just numbers

257.519 --> 262.56
it's only the numbers that do that

260.579 --> 264.3
and what does that even mean

262.56 --> 266.639
right you might just see the

264.3 --> 269.22
correlations of the numbers

266.639 --> 272.04
geometrists

269.22 --> 275.6
but like when you actually listen to

272.04 --> 275.6
their conclusions it's

275.759 --> 280.86
it's never really super concrete now is

278.1 --> 283.68
it I mean the best they they end up

280.86 --> 287.22
doing to convince you is point out like

283.68 --> 289.8
how strong the correlations are

287.22 --> 291.6
and that's it

289.8 --> 294.18
never causation

291.6 --> 299.47900000000004
you ever seen somebody

294.18 --> 299.479
talking about geometry prove a causation

301.32 --> 306.59999999999997
this is a legitimate question to the

303.419 --> 308.94
internet whoever's listening these days

306.6 --> 311.1
I don't know anymore

308.94 --> 313.759
if not the trolls

311.1 --> 313.759
you know

314.82 --> 319.86
since those are the majority of people

317.16 --> 322.139
that comment other people just I don't

319.86 --> 325.46000000000004
know like to listen

322.139 --> 325.46000000000004
and not say anything

328.38 --> 332.759
even though I keep my comment section

330.78 --> 336.55999999999995
open specifically

332.759 --> 336.56
for those people

350.4 --> 354.979
anyway

352.62 --> 354.979
everybody

355.32 --> 359.78
yeah flutters debate yesterday was

357.539 --> 359.78
better

360.3 --> 368.06
I think my message got across

363.0 --> 368.06
because I was just treated fairly

373.139 --> 380.1
right I mean I guess you just have to be

376.86 --> 382.5
loud about it before people finally just

380.1 --> 385.08000000000004
stick to Common Sense

382.5 --> 390.08
because they forget about the common

385.08 --> 390.08
sense for some inexplicable reason

390.72 --> 397.38000000000005
just have to be loud and complaining

394.08 --> 399.18
about it like some wife

397.38 --> 402.259
whose husband just doesn't listen

399.18 --> 402.259
because he's an ass

404.759 --> 408.41900000000004
great

407.22 --> 412.08000000000004
or

408.419 --> 416.21999999999997
I could just figure it out like hey

412.08 --> 419.21999999999997
yeah when we do that this happens maybe

416.22 --> 422.24
we just should pick up on the signals

419.22 --> 425.88000000000005
from our side

422.24 --> 429.06
before it escalates because that always

425.88 --> 432.36
happens every time

429.06 --> 434.039
right and and maybe stick to that

432.36 --> 436.97900000000004
discipline

434.039 --> 440.15999999999997
and not just oh oh whoa Garland just

436.979 --> 441.65999999999997
reminded us of Common Sense let's do the

440.16 --> 443.22
common sense again

441.66 --> 445.139
for a little and then we can forget

443.22 --> 446.28000000000003
about it and become total demons again

445.139 --> 449.52
yeah

446.28 --> 454.19899999999996
yeah let's not do that

449.52 --> 457.58
let's just remember common sense

454.199 --> 457.58
and stick to that

458.88 --> 464.88
anyway hello

460.68 --> 464.88
f 1150.

465.919 --> 470.9
first in chat

468.479 --> 470.9
I

487.919 --> 491.58
all right anyway

496.56 --> 499.52
I'm doing good

499.56 --> 503.84
I had a good rest good dinner

505.8 --> 511.259
stuffy

508.25 --> 514.44
[Music]

511.259 --> 516.9590000000001
mashed taters with gravy

514.44 --> 519.24
and Bharat washed

516.959 --> 523.38
and red beets

519.24 --> 527.48
I mean I love it it's a real filler so

523.38 --> 527.48
a bit like great for winter dinner

534.779 --> 539.82
all right

536.88 --> 542.58
but these days I

539.82 --> 545.7600000000001
guess I have to contend with almost

542.58 --> 548.399
nobody really showing up

545.76 --> 553.26
what it's winter

548.399 --> 556.279
and to be fair I like to get up late as

553.26 --> 556.279
well during winter

556.68 --> 563.459
foreign

559.14 --> 566.04
probably if I'd be a working man with a

563.459 --> 568.4399999999999
typical job of some kind or even working

566.04 --> 570.66
at home but like working

568.44 --> 573.4200000000001
then in the morning I would probably be

570.66 --> 576.0
too grouchy to even want to communicate

573.42 --> 579.9799999999999
so in that sense I get it I get it

576.0 --> 579.98
nobody shows up in the chat

580.14 --> 582.86
barely

584.459 --> 589.38
hey Rob the truth

586.62 --> 590.89
oh there's somebody there at least

589.38 --> 596.03
welcome

590.89 --> 596.03
[Music]

597.779 --> 602.1
right

599.1 --> 605.88
anyway I had some fun yesterday over at

602.1 --> 608.279
flat side I went full Baldwin in the Jab

605.88 --> 610.64
and to a level where I've never went

608.279 --> 610.64
before

612.12 --> 620.279
and they and they ignored me of course

616.74 --> 623.339
because I was basically going full

620.279 --> 627.12
anti-flat earther

623.339 --> 630.48
I have grievances in general and in this

627.12 --> 634.32
case I felt like

630.48 --> 637.279
grafting that grievance within my role

634.32 --> 637.279
as a baller

637.62 --> 642.9590000000001
and it was kind of funny because I think

639.6 --> 646.0790000000001
I might have actually fooled some guy in

642.959 --> 648.3599999999999
the chat with flatzoid who was blatantly

646.079 --> 651.7399999999999
a baller very typically I might have

648.36 --> 651.74
actually fooled him into

651.959 --> 658.3199999999999
thinking that I'm actually a baller

654.48 --> 660.48
because I was absolutely all in and for

658.32 --> 664.0400000000001
like half an hour straight in the chat I

660.48 --> 664.04
was literally spamming

664.32 --> 669.5400000000001
and saying flat earthers are stupid and

667.2 --> 671.1
[ __ ] and they and they never pay

669.54 --> 673.26
attention to anything and they always

671.1 --> 676.44
get things wrong and they're lazy and

673.26 --> 677.88
literally all that and guess what it was

676.44 --> 679.5600000000001
a delightful

677.88 --> 681.959
you know why

679.56 --> 684.06
because I didn't have to make it up

681.959 --> 686.4799999999999
because there was a lot of Truth in what

684.06 --> 686.4799999999999
I said

692.22 --> 696.9590000000001
not all of it of course

694.56 --> 698.64
a lot of it was just Technical and yeah

696.959 --> 701.88
double think

698.64 --> 702.25
concerning the actual arguments but I

701.88 --> 705.46
mean

702.25 --> 705.46
[Music]

706.44 --> 710.8000000000001
I don't know man

707.55 --> 710.8
[Music]

711.48 --> 716.399
maybe I'm just going to turn into an

713.88 --> 718.64
anti-flat earther and just [ __ ] you all

716.399 --> 718.64
up

732.21 --> 737.519
[Music]

735.6 --> 742.0790000000001
because I can

737.519 --> 744.66
yeah and those [ __ ] ass clowns like

742.079 --> 749.519
Professor Dave and fight the Flat Earth

744.66 --> 752.1
and Simon then our literal like

749.519 --> 755.779
fleas

752.1 --> 755.779
compared to what I can do

760.06 --> 765.1199999999999
[Music]

762.48 --> 769.1
and everybody wants to encourage me on a

765.12 --> 771.54
flat Earth debate without even single

769.1 --> 773.72
comprehension of the consequences of

771.54 --> 773.7199999999999
that

775.94 --> 784.6800000000001
[Music]

783.0 --> 786.92
what are you laughing about Rob the

784.68 --> 786.92
truth

793.71 --> 797.869
[Music]

806.459 --> 808.9399999999999
all right

810.06 --> 813.06

814.24 --> 817.49
[Music]

821.26 --> 828.26
[Music]

824.899 --> 828.26
earlier okay

843.5 --> 849.0
[Music]

846.899 --> 851.82
I'm a little ticked off

849.0 --> 853.62
to be fair little bit

851.82 --> 855.0
I'm going full Waller

853.62 --> 857.279
yeah well

855.0 --> 860.22
it's not actually that funny because

857.279 --> 862.38
when I go full baller it's going to be a

860.22 --> 865.86
nightmare for you because I'm going to

862.38 --> 868.4399999999999
make it a nightmare for you

865.86 --> 871.6800000000001
you understand

868.44 --> 874.82
there's anger behind that

871.68 --> 874.8199999999999
if I do that

875.96 --> 884.8090000000001
[Music]

884.88 --> 887.66
ayokuma virus

887.88 --> 892.1
anyway it's not meant for you rob the

889.86 --> 892.1
truth

892.22 --> 898.519
[Music]

896.94 --> 900.3900000000001

Owen Benjamin

900.39 --> 908.06
[Music]

903.48 --> 908.0600000000001
freaking Owen Benjamin guys I mean

909.12 --> 916.8
at this stream with Gardner and he he's

913.199 --> 920.76
literally a bob [ __ ]

916.8 --> 923.399
yeah grab me it's electrostatic you

920.76 --> 926.699
[ __ ] [ __ ]

923.399 --> 927.779
yeah I think that your size caused all

926.699 --> 930.06
that blood

927.779 --> 931.019
to basically rush to your feet or

930.06 --> 934.0189999999999
something

931.019 --> 937.1
cause you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] for saying

934.019 --> 941.699
that and so is Gardner

937.1 --> 944.339
electrostatics you goddamn morons

941.699 --> 946.8599999999999
I mean why does your wife even think

944.339 --> 950.399
about that maybe she hasn't studied up

946.86 --> 952.82
on physics on what is [ __ ] real and

950.399 --> 955.62
what isn't because she would tell you

952.82 --> 957.4200000000001
electrostatics can't be gravity you

955.62 --> 959.639
[ __ ] idiot

957.42 --> 962.16
you've been indoctrinating yourself with

959.639 --> 966.9590000000001
wise nonsense or maybe Crow is

962.16 --> 969.899
blabbering on that [ __ ] retardation

966.959 --> 972.1389999999999
or maybe you still love Jaren despite

969.899 --> 975.32
the crypto because he talks about

972.139 --> 978.6
[ __ ] gravity replacement being

975.32 --> 983.36
electrostatic you [ __ ] [ __ ] I'm

978.6 --> 986.72
embarrassed for you Owen and Gardner

983.36 --> 986.72
Jesus Christ

988.92 --> 992.88
[ __ ] embarrassment

993.839 --> 998.519
I mean do you even know what

996.079 --> 1001.699
electrostatics is

998.519 --> 1005.48
like do you actually know that because

1001.699 --> 1008.779
if you did you would think twice

1005.48 --> 1013.639
and more before you say something as

1008.779 --> 1017.259
idiotic as gravity is electrostatics

1013.639 --> 1017.259
I mean seriously

1017.68 --> 1023.3599999999999
embarrassing

1019.519 --> 1026.48
makes me not like you and what you do

1023.36 --> 1032.02
anymore embarrassing

1026.48 --> 1032.02
yeah you're infected with Bob tardation

1033.74 --> 1037.48
with nonsense yeah

1038.48 --> 1043.939
so in this case for comedic effect I'm

1040.88 --> 1045.679
gonna blame wise for this because you

1043.939 --> 1048.0790000000002
like to hang around with him and you did

1045.679 --> 1050.66
that recently and I know why it's

1048.079 --> 1052.7
blamers on the electrostatics like a

1050.66 --> 1054.44
stupid little Bob sheep

1052.7 --> 1056.6000000000001
because he probably doesn't have the

1054.44 --> 1059.419
faculties to figure out that is absolute

1056.6 --> 1060.5
nonsense like most of globuster

1059.419 --> 1061.76
followers

1060.5 --> 1064.039
yeah

1061.76 --> 1067.66
but apparently neither does Owen

1064.039 --> 1070.94
Benjamin with his physics graduate wife

1067.66 --> 1073.4
who should know better maybe she just

1070.94 --> 1077.72
doesn't even listen because she can feel

1073.4 --> 1080.3200000000002
you're sliding into [ __ ] Owen

I like your social engineering

1103.7 --> 1108.14

yeah that's good stuff you're good at

he hasn't listened

yes keep projecting that [ __ ]

some kind of narrative with it like you

1237.08 --> 1242.48
know what the [ __ ] you're talking about

clip my little clip and let him know and

1296.72 --> 1301.64
maybe you'll get all angry at me and

1298.82 --> 1303.98
make me look like a childless [ __ ] in

1303.98 --> 1307.94
did you drag me through all the mud

1305.78 --> 1310.3999999999999
you're so good at that right I mean you

1307.94 --> 1312.74
could do it with anybody anybody you can

1310.4 --> 1315.02
direct drag to the mud

1312.74 --> 1317.9

1315.02 --> 1321.1399999999999
if you don't always do that I mean you

1317.9 --> 1323.96
really like to look up psychos freaking

1321.14 --> 1327.44
psychos by your own definition and be

1323.96 --> 1332.3600000000001
very tolerant of them until they do

1327.44 --> 1335.299
something wrong and oh yeah yeah

1332.36 --> 1338.12
but how about somebody that has actual

legitimate beef about the technicals

1338.12 --> 1344.299
that you stumble around with

1341.299 --> 1346.4
gonna do that too probably not oh you'd

1344.299 --> 1348.9189999999999
give a little old Arwin a little bit too

1346.4 --> 1352.2800000000002
much attention oh that's not worth it I

1348.919 --> 1356.48
mean nobody cares about that guy

1352.28 --> 1359.48
I mean what's 1500 shows right I mean

you did it all live on stage you're so

on to what I'm talking about

1413.659 --> 1419.3600000000001
add something to that yeah I mean people

1417.14 --> 1422.0590000000002
don't do that these days

1419.36 --> 1426.82
just say hello and then wait for 10

1422.059 --> 1426.82

1444.46 --> 1450.14
okay Tony yeah well that's just nonsense

1447.5 --> 1452.39

1463.04 --> 1466.1399999999999
[Music]

1469.94 --> 1476.299
but Tony what he's probably clumsily

1472.88 --> 1480.14
trying to tell you is that oh look the

1476.299 --> 1481.58
vestibular system requires gravity for

1480.14 --> 1484.5200000000002
its function

1481.58 --> 1486.02
right it requires relative density this

1484.52 --> 1488.36
equilibrium

1486.02 --> 1490.58
as part of the pumping mechanism right

1488.36 --> 1494.539
the counter pressure so that's probably

1490.58 --> 1497.9189999999999
what he unbelievably clumsily tried to

1494.539 --> 1497.919
communicate through that comment

1499.28 --> 1503.24
yeah

1500.48 --> 1508.0
because I know these retards out there

1503.24 --> 1511.039
how they think yeah I was those people

1508.0 --> 1514.88
thought pattern wise except I was

1511.039 --> 1517.4
actually good at it and I had moral

1514.88 --> 1519.7990000000002
nature and awareness of God

1517.4 --> 1522.5590000000002
that's the big difference so I wouldn't

1519.799 --> 1525.32
say those things like a [ __ ] [ __ ]

1522.559 --> 1528.1399999999999
because I had my faculties when I did

1525.32 --> 1530.36
that so I actually had it correct and

1528.14 --> 1532.3600000000001
smart might have been presuppositional

1530.36 --> 1535.6999999999998
but it was correctly

1532.36 --> 1538.039
presuppositional yeah idiots out there

1535.7 --> 1540.919
that are ball commenters these people

1538.039 --> 1543.98
are all mind [ __ ]

1540.919 --> 1548.539
I'm Pharma big Pharma drugs

1543.98 --> 1552.44
they're deliriously stupid and insane

1548.539 --> 1554.96
they're like demonic denying of God like

1552.44 --> 1557.659
in ways not just in principle

1554.96 --> 1560.48
and and so you become a [ __ ] [ __ ]

1557.659 --> 1562.279
and then you can't wield the actual

1560.48 --> 1563.659
arguments anymore that's what happens to

1562.279 --> 1567.46
them

1563.659 --> 1567.46
they literally become [ __ ]

1574.46 --> 1579.4
you try to yeah you probably figured it

1576.86 --> 1579.3999999999999
out as well

1598.34 --> 1602.059
yes I know double step okay thank you

1600.919 --> 1605.419
for that

1602.059 --> 1609.1
I know what geometry is thanks

1605.419 --> 1609.1000000000001
and I know it's adding meaning

1611.36 --> 1617.539
yeah but I'm not talking about it

1614.179 --> 1619.52
talking about the real Gematria the

1617.539 --> 1624.74
non-numerical ones

1619.52 --> 1627.279
which is basically information structure

1624.74 --> 1631.1200000000001
which you can only

1627.279 --> 1631.12
represent virtually

1632.419 --> 1637.539
because there's literally just it's just

1634.76 --> 1637.539
structure

1638.659 --> 1642.279
right so by that sense you could

1641.24 --> 1646.279
literally

1642.279 --> 1650.419
determinate a plant

1646.279 --> 1654.679
through non-numerical Gematria

1650.419 --> 1659.24
could figure out its pattern right

1654.679 --> 1662.6000000000001
now that pattern is not standard imbued

1659.24 --> 1665.36
I mean it it every tree grows slightly

1662.6 --> 1668.6589999999999
different it has certain patterns

1665.36 --> 1671.059
right but you can

1668.659 --> 1673.4
conceptually in your mind see it's like

1671.059 --> 1676.3999999999999
that's one pattern it's one structure

1673.4 --> 1679.22
right it's kind of the same process as

1676.4 --> 1681.919
assigning the extra meaning to

1679.22 --> 1685.279
to letters and numbers

1681.919 --> 1688.1000000000001
with reticular geometria except you can

1685.279 --> 1691.279
do that literally with everything and

1688.1 --> 1693.32
then reverse engineer structures in your

1691.279 --> 1696.5
mind and compare them

1693.32 --> 1698.12
and then the comparison is not just a

1696.5 --> 1700.82
bunch of numbers on paper you're

1698.12 --> 1704.02
comparing it's your intuition that's

1700.82 --> 1704.02
comparing memories

1710.299 --> 1712.9
anyway

1719.81 --> 1722.8799999999999
[Music]

1726.5 --> 1734.0
some vestibular cyst in your veins

1730.7 --> 1737.2
let me Google it might

1734.0 --> 1737.2
technical error there

1740.9 --> 1746.6000000000001
oh wait no it isn't

1743.36 --> 1749.36
it's your inner ear it's your balancing

1746.6 --> 1752.4399999999998
system vestibular right

1749.36 --> 1752.4399999999998
I mix them up

1754.64 --> 1759.3200000000002
right but it comes down to the same

1756.74 --> 1762.14
thing I mean all these mechanics all

1759.32 --> 1764.6
these biomechanics

1762.14 --> 1767.1200000000001
designed by God are all based on

1764.6 --> 1769.34
relative density this equilibrium Force

1767.12 --> 1771.4399999999998
because that's present so you're going

1769.34 --> 1774.1399999999999
to work with what there is

1771.44 --> 1778.22
a vestibular system works with that your

1774.14 --> 1779.2990000000002
heart and your veins work with that

1778.22 --> 1782.48
right

1779.299 --> 1785.779
blood downward doesn't need the extra

1782.48 --> 1788.48
pump it's all about pumping it upward if

1785.779 --> 1790.1
you Circle it which it is in the blood

1788.48 --> 1792.26
and blood system

1790.1 --> 1794.299
and it goes really easy you don't have

1792.26 --> 1796.34
to pump as hard

1794.299 --> 1800.299
with the blood

1796.34 --> 1801.98
if fitting the circle yeah pushing down

1800.299 --> 1803.84
because of relative density this

1801.98 --> 1809.44
equilibrium that makes the pumping it up

1803.84 --> 1809.4399999999998
a lot easier see so in that sense

1809.48 --> 1812.779
it also works that's what I was thinking

1811.88 --> 1816.5
of

1812.779 --> 1820.48
but yeah I didn't realize the vestibular

1816.5 --> 1820.48
system didn't mean the veins

1822.74 --> 1826.34
but the density this equilibrium is

1824.539 --> 1829.039
supposed to be a force yeah yeah it is

1826.34 --> 1834.1
it is a provable force provable

1829.039 --> 1834.1
measurable calculable Force that's right

1836.419 --> 1842.96
yeah just because gravity is no longer

1839.779 --> 1845.24
claimed through heliocentrism physics to

1842.96 --> 1847.7
be a force does it mean that there isn't

1845.24 --> 1850.76
a force there is it's called relative

1847.7 --> 1854.299
density this equilibrium

1850.76 --> 1857.779
it's the things that the thing the

1854.299 --> 1860.539
effect that causes vertical passive

1857.779 --> 1862.88
displacement

1860.539 --> 1865.22
relative density is equilibrium I've

1862.88 --> 1867.64

1879.36 --> 1883.4599999999998

1880.94 --> 1885.98

1883.46 --> 1888.74
I know it is doesn't mean that I can do

1885.98 --> 1889.52
it or want to do it or care about it at

1888.74 --> 1893.179
all

1889.52 --> 1894.679
it's just a matter of fact that I know

1893.179 --> 1897.799
in the future

1894.679 --> 1901.8990000000001
will be more recognized as true because

1897.799 --> 1901.899
people will know how to do it

1902.84 --> 1909.02
there's people now that know how to do

1905.12 --> 1911.36
it ask Richie she got it she gets it she

likes that sort of stuff calculus and

1911.36 --> 1914.08
all that I don't

1917.0 --> 1921.38
you should don't tell me what to care I

it

1943.22 --> 1945.7
okay

1945.74 --> 1950.8990000000001
you do that give you the formula you do

1948.799 --> 1953.12
it you'll figure it out it's not my

1953.12 --> 1958.4189999999999

I know it's real

1962.659 --> 1967.7
no exception no weird Oddity that's oh

1965.96 --> 1969.58
that's kind of out of place no no never

1967.7 --> 1972.98
never ever

1969.58 --> 1975.02
it's so established what relative

1972.98 --> 1977.24
density this equilibrium force is and

1975.02 --> 1979.46
how it works

1977.24 --> 1981.14
that you don't even need numbers to

1979.46 --> 1983.3700000000001

1991.039 --> 1995.6
works so well but it is considerable

1995.86 --> 2002.3799999999999
considerably a natural law at this point

1998.48 --> 2004.84
it is absolute truth it always works

2002.38 --> 2007.8400000000001
there's no exception to it working ever

2457.599 --> 2465.46
are you talking about the CRC check or

2461.44 --> 2468.16
that's the CRC cyclic cyclical

2465.46 --> 2470.32
redundancy check I mean that is sort of

2468.16 --> 2472.48
like a geometry check

2470.32 --> 2475.3
right if any of the numbers you add it

2472.48 --> 2476.859
all up and if the number is off then the

2475.3 --> 2481.119
code is corrupted

2476.859 --> 2484.72
I mean that is kind of a geometry check

2481.119 --> 2489.88
isn't it do the same thing you you add

2484.72 --> 2493.24
all the numbers up to one number

2489.88 --> 2497.44
and then that number has to match the

2493.24 --> 2499.2999999999997
original data block imprint

2497.44 --> 2501.64
and if it's off then that means that

that block of data has been corrupted

2501.64 --> 2504.64

then powder

2553.0 --> 2557.82
I am potent what the [ __ ] is that

2560.26 --> 2562.619
what

2565.66 --> 2571.24
it's not the same as Gematria well it's

2568.54 --> 2574.66
kind of the same really you do the same

2571.24 --> 2578.9799999999996
things the same processes happen

2574.66 --> 2583.68
you you take a block of data text

2578.98 --> 2583.68
numbers and then you add it all up

2583.78 --> 2589.2400000000002
yeah isn't that it you add it up oh it

2586.66 --> 2590.92
adds up to this number or that set of

2589.24 --> 2594.9599999999996
numbers or this right well that's

2590.92 --> 2594.96
exactly what a CRC does

2595.72 --> 2602.0789999999997
it take a blocks attack a matrix of text

2599.079 --> 2605.38
then it adds all that no those numbers

2602.079 --> 2608.38
in The Matrix up

2605.38 --> 2611.8
to a singular number which was also done

2608.38 --> 2614.1400000000003
when first imprinted the block data and

2611.8 --> 2616.8390000000004
then during the CRC

2614.14 --> 2619.54
the check for the information

2616.839 --> 2622.66
if the number is off then that in

2619.54 --> 2624.7599999999998
instantly tells the computer this data

2622.66 --> 2628.44
block has been compromised

2624.76 --> 2628.44
it doesn't have the right imprint

2629.74 --> 2634.9199999999996

2685.599 --> 2690.48

2687.22 --> 2690.48
just finally flowing now

2691.06 --> 2696.339
[Music]

2694.06 --> 2698.2599999999998
why the vector is down no Ari knuckle

Womble

2698.26 --> 2706.6600000000003
it's not down it's vertical

2702.28 --> 2708.099
up and down it's not just down dummy get

2706.66 --> 2710.5
it right

2708.099 --> 2712.9
I don't that's why I don't use the word

2710.5 --> 2715.3
down in relation to relative density

2712.9 --> 2718.06
unless it's very specifically

2715.3 --> 2720.46
the setup where the object is denser

2718.06 --> 2724.0
than the medium

2720.46 --> 2729.099
right but in a general description

2724.0 --> 2732.16
it's passive vertical displacement

2729.099 --> 2733.98
that's why I say that no it's not

2732.16 --> 2736.839
sideways

2733.98 --> 2739.9
passive vertical displacement that may

2736.839 --> 2742.48
result in material spreading out

2739.9 --> 2743.98
horizontally

2742.48 --> 2748.3
because

2743.98 --> 2752.079
yeah because it can't move vertically

2748.3 --> 2754.8390000000004
and then it's gonna push on itself and

2752.079 --> 2758.319
everything else and then spread out

2754.839 --> 2761.02
go level like with liquids

2758.319 --> 2762.819
right unless it's not a liquid and it's

2761.02 --> 2765.46
a solid then it doesn't spread out it

2762.819 --> 2767.38
just sits there and presses

2765.46 --> 2768.94
because it's still surrounded by the

2767.38 --> 2771.04
medium that's less dense so it's going

2768.94 --> 2773.619
to press

2771.04 --> 2776.2
on the location towards the direction

2773.619 --> 2778.6600000000003
where it wants to go

2776.2 --> 2781.68
down because it's still surrounded by

2778.66 --> 2781.68
the less dense median

2782.22 --> 2786.7
right

2784.079 --> 2788.5
sideways is circumstantial the actual

2786.7 --> 2791.74
force of the relative density this

2788.5 --> 2795.099
equilibrium doesn't go sideways

2791.74 --> 2798.819
that's why I describe it as passive

2795.099 --> 2801.52
vertical displacement

2798.819 --> 2803.92
because it's that specifically that is

2801.52 --> 2805.48
the influence that is the force what it

2803.92 --> 2809.579
does because there's plenty of other

2805.48 --> 2809.579
forces happening out there

2810.16 --> 2817.18
like things moving energy introduced

2814.3 --> 2820.0600000000004
all kinds of things right

2817.18 --> 2824.9199999999996
the relative density

2820.06 --> 2828.18
is specifically the factor of passive

2824.92 --> 2828.1800000000003
vertical displacement

2831.579 --> 2837.52
buoyancy do we have a buoyancy is

2834.88 --> 2838.78
relative density it's just been

2837.52 --> 2841.599
translated

2838.78 --> 2843.579
into gravity

2841.599 --> 2845.079
right

2843.579 --> 2848.44
because there's really no difference

2845.079 --> 2849.76
between the density buoyancy system

2848.44 --> 2851.619
uh

2849.76 --> 2853.8390000000004
specific gravity

2851.619 --> 2855.46
as they call it

2853.839 --> 2859.0
there's no difference with relative

2855.46 --> 2862.7200000000003
density except that they assume that gas

2859.0 --> 2865.68
is secretly going down pressing down on

2862.72 --> 2865.68
the denser layers

2865.72 --> 2872.0789999999997
that is part of the Assumption which is

2868.96 --> 2874.7200000000003
like yeah the the chip that makes it

2872.079 --> 2876.28
incomplete that breaks it because it

2874.72 --> 2878.859
doesn't happen like that

2876.28 --> 2883.119
but the mechanics of density and

2878.859 --> 2887.64
buoyancy is exactly relative density

2883.119 --> 2887.6400000000003
display yeah this equilibrium Force

2887.74 --> 2892.4799999999996
except

2889.42 --> 2895.98
it doesn't claim to to have gas push

2892.48 --> 2895.98

3019.68 --> 3026.819
pointless baseless speculation is what

3023.579 --> 3030.0600000000004
it drives yeah the question why

3026.819 --> 3033.24
it drives pointless speculation

3030.06 --> 3036.48
you know what drives through seeking

3033.24 --> 3038.2799999999997
figuring out what

3036.48 --> 3041.46
how

3038.28 --> 3044.8190000000004
what was happening how did it happen

3041.46 --> 3046.46
yeah that's how you find the truth not

3044.819 --> 3051.48
why

3046.46 --> 3051.48
just leads to whining

3059.28 --> 3061.46
foreign

3063.059 --> 3066.1400000000003
yeah it does

3085.099 --> 3091.619
religion inside dude are you [ __ ]

3088.38 --> 3096.1400000000003
are you are you a newbie

3091.619 --> 3096.1400000000003
which is not far away from each other

3100.859 --> 3107.0989999999997
why why does religion and then science

3103.92 --> 3110.16
is the dumbest most ill research

3107.099 --> 3112.7000000000003
statement anybody in this chat has ever

3110.16 --> 3112.7
given me

3115.92 --> 3122.48
yeah religion

3118.619 --> 3126.0
I was not created and that includes

3122.48 --> 3130.16
understanding of God and creation

3126.0 --> 3130.16
by people asking why

3131.04 --> 3135.599
yeah

3132.96 --> 3139.16
that's ridiculous and you cannot back

3135.599 --> 3139.1600000000003
that statement at all

3139.44 --> 3148.38
there isn't even any why in religion

3145.319 --> 3152.7
it's just people asking it they want a

3148.38 --> 3154.92
quick answer why like a six-year-old

3152.7 --> 3159.0589999999997
yeah and then you can always keep asking

3154.92 --> 3160.92
why why why that's why it's whining

3159.059 --> 3164.2200000000003
yeah

3160.92 --> 3166.859
you don't figure anything out that way

3164.22 --> 3169.16
you just dig deeper and deeper and just

3166.859 --> 3171.96
try to find some kind of justification

3169.16 --> 3174.8999999999996
to settle your unrest

3171.96 --> 3178.02
yeah you don't learn anything from it

3174.9 --> 3179.94
how you do learn things is to figure out

3178.02 --> 3182.7599999999998
what is this

3179.94 --> 3187.5
how does it work

3182.76 --> 3189.2400000000002

3187.5 --> 3190.619
health

3189.24 --> 3193.4399999999996
foreign

3190.619 --> 3197.52
right

3193.44 --> 3200.88
what really happened how you don't ask

3197.52 --> 3202.8
why I mean that's cute and all you can

3200.88 --> 3205.26
look at the history of why did this

3202.8 --> 3208.079
happen and then somebody gives some

3205.26 --> 3211.079
random speculation it might be on point

3208.079 --> 3213.8390000000004
it might be totally off

3211.079 --> 3215.88
but it doesn't prove anything

3213.839 --> 3219.839
because only

3215.88 --> 3221.7000000000003
what is this how does this work is what

3219.839 --> 3223.98
proves things

3221.7 --> 3225.24
that's how the scientific method was

3223.98 --> 3226.859
established

3225.24 --> 3229.0789999999997
what is this

3226.859 --> 3235.0989999999997
how does this work

3229.079 --> 3235.099
yeah not why why just leads to whining

even the first time I'm talking about it

3301.26 --> 3306.119
although no doubt nobody here even

3303.96 --> 3308.64
remembers that I did that I mean why

3306.119 --> 3310.92
would any of you ever remember anything

3308.64 --> 3315.2
I've ever talked about

3310.92 --> 3315.2000000000003
I'm talking every day for seven years

no they don't Akuma virus they don't

3331.26 --> 3338.599
deal with why and how

3334.02 --> 3343.94
I deal with what and how

3338.599 --> 3343.94
what is the cause of the effect

3344.48 --> 3351.119
how do you vary and manipulate that

3348.42 --> 3354.1800000000003
cause of the effect in order to

3351.119 --> 3357.42
establish it scientifically whether it

3354.18 --> 3361.6189999999997
is or isn't the cause of the effect what

3357.42 --> 3362.76
and how not why there is no why there is

3361.619 --> 3365.339
no why

3362.76 --> 3367.38
it isn't in there

3365.339 --> 3368.339

put the Y back in it's whining

3388.619 --> 3394.26

3390.72 --> 3396.5989999999997
yeah but there is no why there is no why

3394.26 --> 3398.94
in the scientific method it's not there

3396.599 --> 3400.44
it's not in the text it never has been

3398.94 --> 3403.92
in the text

3400.44 --> 3405.599
it has no place in the scientific method

3403.92 --> 3408.7400000000002
what

3405.599 --> 3408.7400000000002
oh do

3411.0 --> 3414.48
yeah

3412.319 --> 3417.92
like what

3414.48 --> 3417.92
is the cause of the effect

3420.54 --> 3426.359
how do you know it is the cause of the

3423.18 --> 3427.68
effect well you're very manipulated how

3426.359 --> 3429.42
do you do that well you have to figure

3427.68 --> 3432.02
that out you have to just fool around

3429.42 --> 3436.319
with it and see if you can figure out

3432.02 --> 3438.42
how to actually very manipulate the

3436.319 --> 3444.02
independent variable

3438.42 --> 3444.02
yeah what and how there is no why

absolutely correct in everything I've

3488.04 --> 3493.74
just said any more of those statements

3491.88 --> 3495.6600000000003
because I know I know what I'm talking

3493.74 --> 3498.0
about

3495.66 --> 3501.0589999999997
and there's no why in the scientific

3498.0 --> 3503.22
method or in laws

3501.059 --> 3505.8
or anything

3503.22 --> 3508.14
can't do anything with it it's

3505.8 --> 3511.38
unreliable

3508.14 --> 3515.72
the question why is unreliable you need

3511.38 --> 3515.7200000000003
what and you need how

3525.54 --> 3531.119
no theories is not how and why

3529.319 --> 3534.7799999999997
yeah

3531.119 --> 3537.0
please please show me a quotation of the

3534.78 --> 3540.78
scientific method

3537.0 --> 3543.96

you go and do that akumu virus

this why that yeah it doesn't add up

3578.579 --> 3583.6400000000003
though because you're not gonna very

3580.619 --> 3583.6400000000003
manipulate it

3583.859 --> 3589.74
yeah

3586.14 --> 3591.7799999999997
it just leads to speculation does not

3589.74 --> 3595.14
resolve

3591.78 --> 3597.2400000000002
right now if you really wanted to know

3595.14 --> 3599.4
about the sky blue

3597.24 --> 3605.54
and you'd ask what

3599.4 --> 3605.54
is causing this guy to seem blue

3608.88 --> 3616.5
why is like a little kid's question

3613.5 --> 3618.72
is just tell me something about it

3616.5 --> 3622.4
just tell me more I want to know more

3618.72 --> 3622.3999999999996
about this why why

3623.339 --> 3629.339
if you really were sharp and you really

3626.46 --> 3631.64
wanted to know you'd ask what and how

3629.339 --> 3635.42
not why

3631.64 --> 3635.42
it's for little kids

3636.54 --> 3641.339
that's right you can't prove anything

3638.099 --> 3644.579
with why exactly you get it thanks

3641.339 --> 3647.0589999999997
thanks somebody here gets it oh

3644.579 --> 3647.059

3666.78 --> 3669.92
look at all that crap

3672.78 --> 3678.8390000000004
yeah that's not regular clouds

3676.14 --> 3680.94
okay it isn't

3678.839 --> 3682.819
there is no regular clouds in the sky

3680.94 --> 3685.859
right now this is all

3682.819 --> 3689.48
trailing garbage

3685.859 --> 3689.48
you can still see the lines

3690.059 --> 3694.5
let despite that there's still just some

3692.4 --> 3696.48
nice sun coming through it really happy

3694.5 --> 3699.2

it's important yeah yes taking star

3723.119 --> 3727.98
water that's right

3725.16 --> 3731.64
but that's personal

3727.98 --> 3733.44
it's like why are you doing this right

3731.64 --> 3735.96
it's motivation

3733.44 --> 3739.38
it's about the spirit

3735.96 --> 3741.96
yeah it's not about the physical

3739.38 --> 3744.1800000000003
like why is this happening well energy

3741.96 --> 3746.339
stuff circumstances

3744.18 --> 3749.0989999999997
because it was meant to be all kinds of

3746.339 --> 3752.66
things you could answer like that

3749.099 --> 3752.6600000000003
but you don't get specific

3755.339 --> 3761.88
so yeah Y is more for the ethereal

3759.299 --> 3765.14
for the spirit

3761.88 --> 3765.1400000000003
things like motivation

3765.66 --> 3769.799
you can't figure out physical reality

3768.48 --> 3772.92
with why

3769.799 --> 3776.48
we can figure out the spirit perhaps

3772.92 --> 3776.48
perhaps right

3793.619 --> 3801.0
why is asking for the cause well that's

3797.64 --> 3803.839
just regular colloquial talk then

3801.0 --> 3803.839
doubles that forget

3804.54 --> 3809.339
again that's how kids talk that's not

3807.24 --> 3812.16
somebody who's actually like into

3809.339 --> 3813.839
physics talks like

3812.16 --> 3817.319
and they know

3813.839 --> 3821.54
why is the wrong question

3817.319 --> 3821.54
should be asking what and how

3826.68 --> 3832.5
right and basically if you look just on

3830.22 --> 3837.359
a semantic level

3832.5 --> 3840.54
then what and how is basically why split

3837.359 --> 3842.94
apart in two more relative or relevant

3840.54 --> 3844.44
components yeah that's what that really

3842.94 --> 3846.599
is

3844.44 --> 3849.839
what and how

3846.599 --> 3851.57
is y split up in more relevant

3849.839 --> 3857.4

4002.319 --> 4010.579
yeah so non-physical then

4006.2 --> 4014.359
yeah ethereal in the mind yeah why is a

4010.579 --> 4018.1400000000003
matter of Reason oh reason you say oh

4014.359 --> 4020.96
what's the physical substance of reason

4018.14 --> 4023.24
oh yeah yeah it is there isn't no

4020.96 --> 4026.599
physical substance to reason now is

4023.24 --> 4029.4799999999996
there yeah there's only the supernatural

4026.599 --> 4031.819
substance of information

4029.48 --> 4033.859
it falls under the realm of spirit which

4031.819 --> 4037.46
was exactly my point

4033.859 --> 4039.74
not physics not the physical world why

4037.46 --> 4041.96
is not for the physical world it's for

4039.74 --> 4045.319
the spirit

4041.96 --> 4048.26
and for the Consciousness those are the

4045.319 --> 4051.14
that's the domain of why

4048.26 --> 4054.2000000000003
yeah that was my point

4051.14 --> 4055.64
that was my entire point of making this

4054.2 --> 4059.4399999999996

4083.359 --> 4086.2
well

4090.68 --> 4097.4
I mean space is volume right it's it's

4095.299 --> 4099.319
extracted and it's not physical

4097.4 --> 4104.66
substance and neither is time it's

4099.319 --> 4106.46
derived right time is derived space is

4104.66 --> 4109.4
derived to

4106.46 --> 4114.44
like you extract a piece

4109.4 --> 4117.62
of information from actual physical data

4114.44 --> 4118.94
and then you derive a factor from it

4117.62 --> 4120.8589999999995
volume

4118.94 --> 4124.46
which is space

4120.859 --> 4126.56
now time now that's been reified into a

4124.46 --> 4129.14
substance for a very long time but also

4126.56 --> 4131.6
thanks to Einstein's nonsense

4129.14 --> 4134.359
right it is in the physical substance

4131.6 --> 4138.14
it's simply derived what time actually

4134.359 --> 4143.38
is the passage of time is a linear

4138.14 --> 4143.38
consistency within the entropy of matter

4144.199 --> 4152.48
and that consistency is well consistent

4148.4 --> 4156.8589999999995
enough to literally be able to

4152.48 --> 4160.54
fracture it and split it up in moments

4156.859 --> 4160.54
which is what we do with a clock

4162.5 --> 4168.02
so it's derived it's not a time it's not

4165.199 --> 4171.62
a physical substance it's derived

4168.02 --> 4174.219
from the well material consistency of

4171.62 --> 4174.219
entropy

4179.609 --> 4182.819
[Music]

4183.08 --> 4187.94
why is Owen Benjamin lagging behind in

4185.42 --> 4190.04
physics because he hangs around with

4187.94 --> 4193.419999999999
absolute retards

4190.04 --> 4193.42
like David Weiss

4195.02 --> 4200.719
and Crow which I mean he's pretty cool

4198.26 --> 4202.6990000000005
when it comes down to like Spirit stuff

4200.719 --> 4205.699
and old lore and he has nice

4202.699 --> 4208.82
storytelling ideas Etc I mean

4205.699 --> 4211.639999999999
but they're all just like glow Busters

4208.82 --> 4214.96
level retards

4211.64 --> 4217.76
they all got programmed

4214.96 --> 4220.699
indoctrinated with nonsense like oh

4217.76 --> 4222.679
gravity is really electrostatics oh yes

4220.699 --> 4225.678999999999
yes [ __ ]

4222.679 --> 4228.32
I mean that's really asinine to say that

4225.679 --> 4231.62
at this stage

4228.32 --> 4235.219
really at really asinine

4231.62 --> 4238.699
very painful to hear somebody that you

4235.219 --> 4240.5
like and respect repeat that utter

4238.699 --> 4245.178999999999
garbage

4240.5 --> 4247.52
yeah I mean that's scam level garbage it

4245.179 --> 4249.58
is it's a scam yeah

4247.52 --> 4251.780000000001
gravity being electrostatic

4249.58 --> 4253.5199999999995
non-dielectric acceleration blah blah

4251.78 --> 4256.159
blah it's a scam

4253.52 --> 4260.06
that's a scam

4256.159 --> 4262.639999999999
not saying that Owen is on purpose part

4260.06 --> 4264.679
of that scam I'm saying he's too stupid

4262.64 --> 4266.659000000001
to realize it is

4264.679 --> 4269.78
and he falling for it and he's like oh

4266.659 --> 4271.5199999999995
but they're my friends yeah

4269.78 --> 4273.5599999999995
that's what he's doing they looked his

4271.52 --> 4275.2390000000005
friends oh he likes Crow so much oh he

4273.56 --> 4280.6
likes David so much yeah well guess what

4275.239 --> 4280.599999999999
they blabber this scam [ __ ]

4281.36 --> 4288.4
foreign for quite some time and now it's

4285.32 --> 4288.4
rubbing off on Owen

4292.64 --> 4296.659000000001
he's obviously not up to date with the

4294.62 --> 4298.28
Flat Earth debate which he absolutely

4296.659 --> 4301.639999999999
should be

4298.28 --> 4303.679
because that is where you learn the real

4301.64 --> 4306.320000000001
Flat Earth

4303.679 --> 4309.7
what's really happening and real physics

4306.32 --> 4313.0599999999995
what's really happening

4309.7 --> 4317.0599999999995
[Music]

4313.06 --> 4319.46
I heard this electric by Nature uh what

4317.06 --> 4321.679
the [ __ ] does that even mean

4319.46 --> 4323.659
yeah there's electricity

4321.679 --> 4326.3
electricity is involved in a whole bunch

4323.659 --> 4329.599999999999
of things has nothing to do with

4326.3 --> 4332.719
vertical passive displacement

4329.6 --> 4335.96
at all yeah and to say that gravity is

4332.719 --> 4338.2390000000005
electrostatics is so acidine it's

4335.96 --> 4339.88
unbelievable

4338.239 --> 4343.28
I mean

4339.88 --> 4345.8
just realize

4343.28 --> 4347.3
like all the roots of gravity how that's

4345.8 --> 4350.6
supposed to work right massive

4347.3 --> 4352.52
correcting Mass over distance not

4350.6 --> 4355.64
measurable

4352.52 --> 4357.9800000000005
all those things about gravity right and

4355.64 --> 4361.04
then think about electrostatics and then

4357.98 --> 4361.959999999999
notice how that's exactly the opposite

4361.04 --> 4363.98
of everything

4361.96 --> 4366.38
[Music]

4363.98 --> 4370.699
when you compare it to gravity

4366.38 --> 4373.06
it's so stupid it's unbelievably dumb to

4370.699 --> 4373.0599999999995
say that

4377.36 --> 4383.54
it's unbelievably dumb to say that

4382.28 --> 4386.659
yeah

4383.54 --> 4388.0
it's opposite in like every conceivable

4386.659 --> 4392.299999999999
way

4388.0 --> 4393.44
electrostatics short range Wild

4392.3 --> 4396.9800000000005
not

4393.44 --> 4400.5199999999995
not easily falling in line of a singular

4396.98 --> 4403.04
Direction yeah measurable

4400.52 --> 4407.2390000000005
you can literally add and take away

4403.04 --> 4408.92
energy from electrostatics yeah yeah all

4407.239 --> 4411.919999999999
those things yeah and now compare that

4408.92 --> 4416.54
to gravity oh wait it has none of that

4411.92 --> 4418.42
at all yeah and we can't just oh well we

4416.54 --> 4421.64
can influence electrostatics and since

4418.42 --> 4425.96
gravity is electrostatics let's just

4421.64 --> 4428.54
like make steps things stop falling

4425.96 --> 4430.04
in a in a non-moving situation let's

4428.54 --> 4433.94
just like

4430.04 --> 4437.239
have a a rock and a helium balloon just

4433.94 --> 4439.82
hang there both hang there in a

4437.239 --> 4441.678999999999
stationary setting let's do it yeah I

4439.82 --> 4443.9
mean you think you can do that because

4441.679 --> 4446.78
you believe that gravity is

4443.9 --> 4447.92
electrostatics and electrostatics are

4446.78 --> 4451.5199999999995
measurable

4447.92 --> 4454.28
and alterable yeah so why did you do

4451.52 --> 4459.159000000001
that then yeah and it told me oh oh we

4454.28 --> 4462.739
made a balloon slightly lighter

4459.159 --> 4465.5599999999995
no no I mean oh so you're talking about

4462.739 --> 4467.839999999999
the vertical displacement of relative

4465.56 --> 4471.38
density this equilibrium Force right

4467.84 --> 4474.62
that means up and down Okay so let's see

4471.38 --> 4477.219
you neutralize that vertical

4474.62 --> 4479.3
displacement

4477.219 --> 4481.219
allegedly proving you're very

4479.3 --> 4483.8
manipulating it which is what you need

4481.219 --> 4488.0
to prove it scientifically to be real

4483.8 --> 4491.900000000001
so let's see you float a rock and a

4488.0 --> 4494.42
helium balloon right next to one another

4491.9 --> 4497.54
let's see that yeah

4494.42 --> 4499.52
do that and I'll start getting

4497.54 --> 4501.199
interesting I'll start getting

4499.52 --> 4503.6
interested

4501.199 --> 4506.419999999999
yeah yeah you don't

4503.6 --> 4509.42
you just make an object slightly lighter

4506.42 --> 4512.179
or something by subjecting it to a

4509.42 --> 4514.46
charge yeah that's not varying and

4512.179 --> 4518.12
manipulating the passive vertical

4514.46 --> 4520.699
displacement that's adding

4518.12 --> 4522.5
an effect

4520.699 --> 4525.86
adding

4522.5 --> 4528.38
not ferrying and manipulating

4525.86 --> 4529.88
the foundational effect that's there at

4528.38 --> 4533.56
all time

4529.88 --> 4535.659000000001
yeah it's adding something

4533.56 --> 4538.88
electrostatic charge

4535.659 --> 4540.92
adding something not varying and

4538.88 --> 4544.82
manipulating

4540.92 --> 4547.4800000000005
yeah did he get it yet you get it yet

4544.82 --> 4547.48
dummy

4553.94 --> 4558.2
ah

4556.1 --> 4560.84
thank you

4558.2 --> 4563.659
[Music]

4560.84 --> 4566.3
my magnetism looks a bit like other

4563.659 --> 4569.199
Force no it doesn't

4566.3 --> 4569.1990000000005
it's a field

4569.42 --> 4575.3
magnetism is a field it's not like any

4572.659 --> 4577.339999999999
other forces at all

4575.3 --> 4581.08
there really isn't anything like

4577.34 --> 4581.08
magnetism at all

4583.46 --> 4588.219
right a force just a force it's not a

4585.98 --> 4588.218999999999
field

4588.56 --> 4595.64
it's in effect it's local it

4592.219 --> 4597.86
it doesn't have like oh a certain range

4595.64 --> 4600.14
at a distance and then

4597.86 --> 4601.94
you get into that range then suddenly

4600.14 --> 4604.780000000001
things is influenced no that's not how

4601.94 --> 4604.78
forces work

4606.38 --> 4612.26
yeah magnetism is a field

4609.38 --> 4615.400000000001
relative density this equilibrium force

4612.26 --> 4615.400000000001
is not a field

4618.699 --> 4626.178999999999
yeah I mean Newtonian gravity was very

4623.48 --> 4628.78
much compared to magnetism at a very

4626.179 --> 4628.78
early stage

4629.42 --> 4635.6
to kind of like make magnetism rub off

4632.54 --> 4638.6
conceptually onto it so people that

4635.6 --> 4642.14
think about gravity will think of it as

4638.6 --> 4645.8
a field yeah well outside of magnetism

4642.14 --> 4649.64
there is no such thing at all

4645.8 --> 4653.08
yeah it's just magnetism feels magnetism

4649.64 --> 4653.08
it's just magnetism

4655.76 --> 4660.1
magnetic fields create Force

4662.6 --> 4667.64
yeah they do

4665.6 --> 4671.120000000001
specific

4667.64 --> 4672.52
very specific types though

4671.12 --> 4677.38
right

4672.52 --> 4677.38
two compared magnetism and gravity

4677.54 --> 4682.12
uh

4678.679 --> 4682.12
my physics teacher

4683.0 --> 4686.08
all kinds of people

4687.56 --> 4695.14
that do lectures about what gravity is

4690.62 --> 4695.14
dude all kinds of people

4695.84 --> 4700.6990000000005
I mean that's like the standard way they

4698.54 --> 4702.5
teach it in schools like oh gravity what

4700.699 --> 4703.759999999999
is it oh it's kind of like a magnetic

4702.5 --> 4705.92
field it's like one of the first things

4703.76 --> 4708.62
they tell you

4705.92 --> 4710.0
what do you mean who says that everybody

4708.62 --> 4714.239
says that

4710.0 --> 4714.239
[Music]

4716.54 --> 4721.06
right it's part of the heliocentric

4718.58 --> 4721.0599999999995
narrative

4721.46 --> 4725.4800000000005
it's the first thing they compare it to

4723.14 --> 4727.34
to a magnetic field

4725.48 --> 4729.98
because the magnetic field is the only

4727.34 --> 4733.219
thing that can just like grab at things

4729.98 --> 4736.04
at a distance it's very magical

4733.219 --> 4738.38
yeah they needed that for Gravity they

4736.04 --> 4740.78
needed to be something that influences

4738.38 --> 4743.36
stuff at a distance and the only thing

4740.78 --> 4745.759999999999
that does that is magnetism

4743.36 --> 4748.04
so that's why this the first thing they

4745.76 --> 4750.14
made you compare that to like oh look

4748.04 --> 4752.12
it's gravity right it's just like a

4750.14 --> 4753.4400000000005
magnet look attract something at a

4752.12 --> 4755.179
distance you probably does that too

4753.44 --> 4757.219
that's what they teach you in school

4755.179 --> 4759.46
still now

4757.219 --> 4759.46
foreign

4762.86 --> 4765.86
Force

4766.04 --> 4769.06
well it's a field

4775.4 --> 4782.12
and in that field forces can manifest

4779.38 --> 4785.0
circumstantially I don't know it's

4782.12 --> 4786.8
it's yeah okay fine you can call it a

4785.0 --> 4791.14
force

4786.8 --> 4791.14
but it's not just like a regular

4791.42 --> 4796.2300000000005
well non-field Force though it's

4794.239 --> 4799.419999999999
different

I don't know I don't want to talk about

4850.699 --> 4855.678999999999
magnets I only used it as a comparison

4853.52 --> 4857.42
because it's fields

4855.679 --> 4860.54
yeah

4857.42 --> 4863.12
it's the only source of fields you do

4860.54 --> 4866.239
realize that right I mean can I get a

4863.12 --> 4868.0
freaking confirmation from anybody in

4866.239 --> 4872.48
chat yeah

4868.0 --> 4876.51
magnetism is the only field

4872.48 --> 4878.48
can I get a confirmation

4878.48 --> 4881.199

why the [ __ ] would I have to do that

4888.56 --> 4891.9400000000005
yeah the only field

4892.04 --> 4897.38
magnetic field it's the only thing that

4894.8 --> 4900.14
has a field

4897.38 --> 4902.900000000001
that is actually a field and not just

4900.14 --> 4907.46
something else

4902.9 --> 4910.659
I mean what other things do attract

4907.46 --> 4910.659
over a distance

4912.26 --> 4917.14
no I'm not gonna watch that video

4914.3 --> 4917.14

4920.659 --> 4926.48
oh my god

4922.9 --> 4929.799999999999
oh and now we are gonna ask that oh you

4926.48 --> 4929.799999999999

4939.08 --> 4942.94
aren't there electric fields

4944.42 --> 4949.88
no

4946.52 --> 4952.46
that's effectively magnetic

4949.88 --> 4955.46
that's like the whole point about it

4952.46 --> 4957.1
like magnetic fields and electricity are

4955.46 --> 4960.58
intricately linked

4957.1 --> 4960.58
intrinsically linked

4964.1 --> 4970.52
right magnetism is like caused

4968.06 --> 4972.02
by like the electric charge doing

4970.52 --> 4973.610000000001
something I don't know I'm not an

5007.54 --> 5013.6

5013.6 --> 5017.52
give me all the screen time I ever need

5036.1 --> 5040.26
why are you literally this

5053.47 --> 5057.719
[Music]

5054.82 --> 5057.719
foreign

5076.32 --> 5082.299999999999
I record this

5079.0 --> 5084.46
for 20 minutes and now it's complete

5082.3 --> 5086.14
nobody can now follow what the hell I'm

5084.46 --> 5088.2390000000005

5092.02 --> 5097.26
Oakley

5093.58 --> 5097.26

[Music]

5122.98 --> 5128.678999999999
for coming I'm rounding it out short

5125.679 --> 5130.36
because yeah YouTube is literally done

5128.679 --> 5132.1
that would have been great would have

5130.36 --> 5134.44
been a continuation of everything before

5132.1 --> 5138.88
in this stream at what the hell is going

5134.44 --> 5141.099999999999
on like like three to five seconds so

5138.88 --> 5143.9800000000005
it's

5141.1 --> 5146.46
right so thanks everyone for coming I

5143.98 --> 5150.759999999999

5179.32 --> 5184.659
hopefully with a normal freaking stream

5182.5 --> 5189.06
where it doesn't just destroy the entire

5184.659 --> 5189.0599999999995
stream by stalling this ridiculously

5191.88 --> 5198.4800000000005
all right anyway I'll be back to show

5194.62 --> 5198.48
now or in the pre-show

5199.0 --> 5204.639
because yeah that starts up

5202.0 --> 5206.92
like an half hour before the live show

5204.639 --> 5208.900000000001
right so anyway

5206.92 --> 5212.26
hope to see you all there during the

5208.9 --> 5214.9
life's show it should be

5212.26 --> 5219.820000000001
