232.64 --> 238.48
apjc net

250.4 --> 256.32
informed like even new wasn't rumpassy

254.4 --> 257.919
like and that's like whoa

256.32 --> 259.68
dude

257.919 --> 261.59999999999997

261.6 --> 267.12
miracle and he knows

263.919 --> 269.52
he said it himself

267.12 --> 271.6
uh

269.52 --> 272.56
but yeah great show

271.6 --> 274.96000000000004
nathan

272.56 --> 277.68
after show lasted incredibly long it was

274.96 --> 279.19899999999996
an over four hour show altogether over

277.68 --> 281.12
four hours just

279.199 --> 284.639
poof

281.12 --> 287.919
nathan was really grinding down on

284.639 --> 287.919
was it this was it

288.88 --> 293.04
it was

289.759 --> 294.96000000000004
it was a couple of guys

293.04 --> 298.32
same i think that the guy that was

294.96 --> 299.84
talking about molten buildings

298.32 --> 301.68
being mountains

299.84 --> 304.4
was in there too

301.68 --> 308.16
and ether and it just nathan just kept

304.4 --> 308.15999999999997
going going and going going

308.96 --> 313.59999999999997
so yeah

311.52 --> 315.52
some of you may enjoy that watching that

313.6 --> 320.08000000000004
back

315.52 --> 322.639
it's getting very hard very strict

320.08 --> 326.15999999999997
and yeah the opposition just getting

322.639 --> 329.28000000000003
belligerent and childish

326.16 --> 331.12
right it's really palpable

329.28 --> 332.4
i mean those moments are fascinating to

331.12 --> 335.759
me because

332.4 --> 337.52
it just reminds me of how i

335.759 --> 341.039
tended to be

337.52 --> 343.12
halfway when it was much younger like

341.039 --> 344.88
when my parents or my brother was trying

343.12 --> 346.72
to explain me something and i wouldn't

344.88 --> 350.56
accept it

346.72 --> 350.56
i would get that belligerent and

351.039 --> 356.479
it's like i'm really sorry that they

353.28 --> 359.44
couldn't sit through that eventually

356.479 --> 363.75899999999996
because it was such it was just really

359.44 --> 368.0
productive for me to get those moments

363.759 --> 370.47900000000004
and face that and be tested

368.0 --> 370.479
it's like

372.72 --> 376.96000000000004
i don't know if it's yeah it just

374.72 --> 378.88000000000005
reminds me of that i mean this is a

376.96 --> 382.15999999999997
different situation that these people

378.88 --> 384.0
are supposedly adults

382.16 --> 387.84000000000003
and

384.0 --> 387.84
i don't know if it's the same to them

388.88 --> 393.84
right but i definitely get out of those

391.52 --> 396.79999999999995
get something out of those grindings

393.84 --> 396.79999999999995
when nathan does it

396.96 --> 401.039
uh hey seeking star water mike sadoonich

399.84 --> 404.479
kevin k

401.039 --> 404.479
flatter sage good to see you

404.88 --> 409.039
right so yeah also yesterday

408.0 --> 410.4
uh

409.039 --> 413.039
through

410.4 --> 416.0
one of david weiss's channel was it the

413.039 --> 416.0
the app channel

417.68 --> 424.40000000000003
let me see

419.919 --> 426.479
ladder of the sun moon zodiac clock app

424.4 --> 428.31899999999996
channel

426.479 --> 431.84
it's david weiss yeah there was a full

428.319 --> 434.0
premiere of the next level

431.84 --> 436.4
and yeah watch the

434.0 --> 439.68
biggest part of that

436.4 --> 442.23999999999995
but there's gonna be a whole bunch of

439.68 --> 442.24
ruckus

442.639 --> 445.28000000000003
because

445.36 --> 450.99
yeah

447.039 --> 452.4
ether ether ether

450.99 --> 454.319
[Music]

452.4 --> 456.23999999999995
what's in there

454.319 --> 457.12
as well

456.24 --> 458.56
and

457.12 --> 459.28000000000003
yeah

458.56 --> 461.68
like

459.28 --> 464.63899999999995
little moments that just rub

461.68 --> 465.919
a lot of flat earth debaters very wrong

464.639 --> 468.40000000000003
it's

465.919 --> 470.639
like david white saying that

468.4 --> 474.31899999999996
the rotation of bob's ring laser

470.639 --> 477.319
gyroscope proves ether rotation right

474.319 --> 477.319
now

478.08 --> 481.68
a general statement

482.0 --> 487.919
writer as a speculative statement that

484.8 --> 490.08
would have been like yeah okay but the

487.919 --> 492.15999999999997
way he said it was just like no it's the

490.08 --> 494.56
ether and yeah that's going to be a

492.16 --> 494.56
problem

494.879 --> 498.40000000000003
also of course some

498.879 --> 502.879
literal position reification issues but

501.84 --> 504.0
yeah that's

502.879 --> 505.199
that

504.0 --> 507.44
like

505.199 --> 509.28000000000003
that's just really tough like even

507.44 --> 510.8
nathan oakley is going to give them a

509.28 --> 512.399
break for that

510.8 --> 515.2
because it's just yeah physicality

512.399 --> 518.56
assumption bias is a [ __ ] it really is

515.2 --> 521.36
a [ __ ] to a whole bunch of people right

518.56 --> 523.4399999999999
and at least it will give like a

521.36 --> 525.44
a

523.44 --> 527.36
a counter narrative

525.44 --> 529.7600000000001
to the sun being all those millions of

527.36 --> 531.2
miles away which is ridiculous

529.76 --> 532.959
right

531.2 --> 534.9590000000001
but yeah the ether is going to be a bit

532.959 --> 537.68
of a problem other than that by the way

534.959 --> 540.7199999999999
i i thought i didn't let it

537.68 --> 543.76
ruin it for me

540.72 --> 546.399
and i thought that the rest of the whole

543.76 --> 549.519
video was yeah it was okay

546.399 --> 552.24
it seemed a bit

549.519 --> 555.12
virtue signally though in a way a little

552.24 --> 558.88
bit weird maybe but

555.12 --> 561.6
good imagery basic arguments

558.88 --> 564.48
that were laid out very well with good

561.6 --> 566.08
footage support

564.48 --> 567.12
and

566.08 --> 569.279
yeah

567.12 --> 571.279
except for the the ether

569.279 --> 574.64
part and even that wasn't all that

571.279 --> 574.64
egregious it's just that

574.8 --> 579.279
yeah you know what i mean

577.36 --> 580.16
so overall i thought that wasn't that

579.279 --> 581.36
bad

580.16 --> 583.12
right

581.36 --> 586.5600000000001
i mean it's better than beyond the

583.12 --> 586.5600000000001
imaginary curve for sure

587.6 --> 593.839
and yeah it was very much like level

590.64 --> 596.959
it's like level one and a half just

593.839 --> 596.9590000000001
a bit more into it

597.519 --> 605.16
right so have any of you seen that video

600.8 --> 605.16
i'll link you up if you haven't

606.399 --> 610.56
because there is a whole lot of people

608.56 --> 613.76
that are gonna see this

610.56 --> 613.76
including newbies

615.76 --> 619.8389999999999
so i think i'll just link you guys up

622.24 --> 625.92
it's one hour 20 minutes

630.88 --> 634.48
all right now let's see what you guys

632.72 --> 636.72
are chatting about

634.48 --> 636.72
uh

639.6 --> 643.0400000000001
the mountain claim

644.56 --> 650.399
right yeah there was one part in the

646.56 --> 652.4799999999999
movie specifically that i really liked

650.399 --> 654.88
why did i like it because

652.48 --> 657.519
they try to do it kind of like how i try

654.88 --> 660.48
to do it they try to explain the horizon

657.519 --> 663.76
and why it's not geometric and

660.48 --> 666.72
even like using hand visuals like i

663.76 --> 668.959
typically like to do

666.72 --> 670.48
like how it folds into the right so they

668.959 --> 672.56
kind of used

670.48 --> 675.6
while they used my vernacular it's not

672.56 --> 677.92
my vernaculars or wins no it's just the

675.6 --> 680.9590000000001
vernacular that i use because i think

677.92 --> 683.279
that it works the best

680.959 --> 685.3599999999999
they've assimilated it and yeah that

683.279 --> 687.519
makes me feel good because that's an

685.36 --> 688.72
effective way to help people understand

687.519 --> 692.5600000000001
that part

688.72 --> 692.5600000000001
right so there's some good in this movie

698.0 --> 701.92
i mean that the horizon part i was

700.079 --> 704.399
really like that gave me a smile like

701.92 --> 706.8
yeah yeah that's how i try to explain it

704.399 --> 708.32
it's really difficult it is difficult

706.8 --> 710.88
but

708.32 --> 712.5600000000001
i mean you can

710.88 --> 716.959
hand

712.56 --> 718.6389999999999
motions really do help people assist

716.959 --> 720.079
trying to size up what they're looking

718.639 --> 724.8
at

720.079 --> 726.88
and they can then compare that to like

724.8 --> 729.1999999999999
flying footage going like straight at

726.88 --> 731.04
the horizon and seeing what happens and

729.2 --> 733.519
even if you like reverse the footage

731.04 --> 734.88
like what is it you're actually seeing

733.519 --> 738.16
right

734.88 --> 740.959
it helps with all that to really get it

738.16 --> 743.36
into people's head to want to understand

740.959 --> 747.1199999999999
how the horizon isn't geometric and how

743.36 --> 751.12
things basically visually fall into it

747.12 --> 751.12
as they disappear into the horizon

751.44 --> 756.8000000000001
all right so yeah that was good

754.48 --> 759.6800000000001
hello slo-mo moon buggy good to see you

756.8 --> 763.7199999999999
you agree with my assessment alright

759.68 --> 763.7199999999999
you saw it too i take it

764.39 --> 767.4499999999999
[Music]

775.839 --> 780.0
got loads to watch yet

777.68 --> 780.0
all right

780.32 --> 785.0400000000001
yeah it is one hour 20 minutes but yeah

782.88 --> 788.16
i was just

785.04 --> 790.639
i know it went premiering live and when

788.16 --> 793.04
something premieres live there's a live

790.639 --> 795.44
chat i'm much more inclined to actually

793.04 --> 798.399
watch it then because i can give live

795.44 --> 801.2
feedback to it as i'm going right there

798.399 --> 803.04
test a bit of the waters like see

801.2 --> 805.6
if they're going to be like oh no not

803.04 --> 808.639
irwin or something and i wasn't bad on

805.6 --> 811.12
his i didn't get any slaps

808.639 --> 813.519
or any like i don't know

811.12 --> 815.68
angry bobs getting in my way trying to

813.519 --> 817.2
get me out of the way

815.68 --> 819.4399999999999
even though i was

817.2 --> 820.88
kind of myself just being very honest

819.44 --> 822.32
and critical

820.88 --> 825.6
not trying to

822.32 --> 827.839
be too rude like oh you're why won't you

825.6 --> 829.76
just get it or something like that

827.839 --> 832.639
wasn't like that at all

829.76 --> 834.959
straight to the point

832.639 --> 837.44
and yeah it was a

834.959 --> 839.92
it was interesting

837.44 --> 839.9200000000001
to watch

840.639 --> 844.16
and yeah i even got a couple of people

842.48 --> 846.16
in there

844.16 --> 847.36
advertising for my show and i was like

846.16 --> 849.68
oh hey

847.36 --> 852.24
was it that flat fellow

849.68 --> 853.8389999999999
was in there like oh arwen has a show

852.24 --> 856.639
watch his show

853.839 --> 858.1600000000001
he interacts with chad like yeah thanks

856.639 --> 861.6800000000001
man

858.16 --> 861.68
that was an unexpected bonus

865.44 --> 871.12
right that's all pretty cool

868.48 --> 874.0
i mean yeah there's issues right there's

871.12 --> 877.92
technical issues like

874.0 --> 879.76
academic technical issues with the ether

877.92 --> 882.0
and for me

879.76 --> 884.079
on a more philosophical note it's more

882.0 --> 886.959
difficult

884.079 --> 889.199
sun position reification

886.959 --> 891.5999999999999
but other than that it was i thought it

889.199 --> 894.56
was great it was like that's something

891.6 --> 896.399
i'm okay with like going around

894.56 --> 898.4799999999999
and yeah there will be a lot of people

896.399 --> 900.959
like what about ether what about either

898.48 --> 902.24
we can deal with either dude we've dealt

900.959 --> 903.76
with the ball

902.24 --> 905.199
we've dealt with the curvature

903.76 --> 908.399
calculator

905.199 --> 910.16
with terrestrial refraction

908.399 --> 913.92
right

910.16 --> 916.16
with with all these things with gravity

913.92 --> 917.8389999999999
we've dealt with it we can deal with

916.16 --> 920.079
ether

917.839 --> 920.0790000000001
right

920.24 --> 926.8
i can deal with it i mean i am much less

923.04 --> 928.3199999999999
allergic to ether than like nathan is in

926.8 --> 930.399
qe

928.32 --> 933.12
i still think it's an aberration though

930.399 --> 935.199
right but hey i i like to screw around

933.12 --> 936.72
with gravity even right i understand

935.199 --> 939.68
gravity i understand the mistakes i

936.72 --> 942.0790000000001
understand how people dwell on it

939.68 --> 945.04
right i understand how

942.079 --> 948.16
newtonian gravity was essential

945.04 --> 951.04
an essential fundamental ingredient

948.16 --> 953.36
for the heliocentric model framework

951.04 --> 955.04
can't really work without it like all

953.36 --> 957.759
these things i understand about it like

955.04 --> 960.7199999999999
i'm almost like a historical catalog for

957.759 --> 961.92
what it is and what it does

960.72 --> 963.759
so

961.92 --> 966.16
we can deal with ether i can deal with

963.759 --> 970.639
ether

966.16 --> 971.8389999999999
and hey maybe a whole ether hassle maybe

970.639 --> 974.639
i could kind of

971.839 --> 976.8000000000001
use that as a little

974.639 --> 978.48
as a as a pedestal

976.8 --> 979.4399999999999
to stand on

978.48 --> 982.88
and

979.44 --> 986.24
address a couple of issues with lights

982.88 --> 987.92
like how i don't think it is a

986.24 --> 990.0
a particle

987.92 --> 993.04
with a minimal size that that's just

990.0 --> 995.199
convention based and my tests

993.04 --> 997.36
in order to prove or disprove that

995.199 --> 998.959
assertion

997.36 --> 1000.0790000000001
and yeah

998.959 --> 1003.7589999999999
i'll

1000.079 --> 1003.7589999999999
have more potential

1003.92 --> 1008.88
people that might be interested in

1007.279 --> 1011.12
i don't know

1008.88 --> 1013.12
doing that or

1011.12 --> 1015.36
getting a group together figuring out

1013.12 --> 1018.079
how to do that or getting sponsorship

1015.36 --> 1019.759
for i don't know arkham lasers to test

1018.079 --> 1022.079
it

1019.759 --> 1023.6800000000001
are gone sorry

1022.079 --> 1025.4389999999999
so

1023.68 --> 1028.319
see

1025.439 --> 1030.3190000000002
it's just whatever happens you got it

1028.319 --> 1032.319
you're gonna have to live with it why

1030.319 --> 1034.079
not try to figure out how to do

1032.319 --> 1037.72
something productive with it when it's

1034.079 --> 1037.72
gonna happen anyway

1042.72 --> 1046.88
ether shouldn't dismiss the overwhelming

1044.799 --> 1048.799
evidence against the yeah but eve look

1046.88 --> 1050.3200000000002
kevin k even

1048.799 --> 1053.12
globers

1050.32 --> 1054.72
have a place for ether even people that

1053.12 --> 1056.559
stick to the globe

1054.72 --> 1059.28
are still very much

1056.559 --> 1060.6399999999999
inclined to dabble in thinking about

1059.28 --> 1063.44
ether and like

1060.64 --> 1065.8400000000001
what are all these patterns

1063.44 --> 1068.0
why is it so suggestive that that it's

1065.84 --> 1070.3999999999999
like waves and we treat it like waves

1068.0 --> 1074.559
but it isn't waves and

1070.4 --> 1076.16
right that's fascinating to people

1074.559 --> 1077.84
that that like

1076.16 --> 1079.44
to understand things

1077.84 --> 1082.799
so

1079.44 --> 1084.96
it's not a flat earth thing it's just

1082.799 --> 1086.8799999999999
that a lot of flat earthers they've

1084.96 --> 1089.1200000000001
dealt with all the machinations of the

1086.88 --> 1092.48
globe to a certain degree

1089.12 --> 1095.1999999999998
and now ether is like the next on the

1092.48 --> 1097.28
menu for them to

1095.2 --> 1101.1200000000001
to wrestle with

1097.28 --> 1103.6
even though it is sort of separate from

1101.12 --> 1105.76
the philosophical debate between the

1103.6 --> 1108.0
earth shapes

1105.76 --> 1110.24
right it's not directly connected to

1108.0 --> 1110.24
that

1114.08 --> 1118.08
all right it's just it happens to be on

1116.48 --> 1122.16
the mind of a whole bunch of people and

1118.08 --> 1125.4399999999998
they're it's being played into

1122.16 --> 1129.24
ken wheeler of course the

1125.44 --> 1129.24
ethereal wizards

1139.679 --> 1144.5590000000002
oh right yeah the child seeing

1142.24 --> 1147.1200000000001
the guys think yeah

1144.559 --> 1149.52
yeah though the whole part about oh the

1147.12 --> 1152.3999999999999
lands beyond how would that change ever

1149.52 --> 1154.4
that's just that's the same in 2015

1152.4 --> 1158.5590000000002
nonsense

1154.4 --> 1159.52
i agree it's like oh if only we all get

1158.559 --> 1161.6
over

1159.52 --> 1163.44
you become a flat earther and we all

1161.6 --> 1165.28
decide we do this then everything's

1163.44 --> 1167.52
gonna change yeah that is magical

1165.28 --> 1169.36
thinking

1167.52 --> 1171.44
it's not real it's not actually gonna

1169.36 --> 1174.8799999999999
happen

1171.44 --> 1174.88
like it wouldn't work like that

1175.12 --> 1182.08
the real key is to actually like

1178.64 --> 1184.5590000000002
the re the best message would be

1182.08 --> 1188.08
stop getting carried away with things

1184.559 --> 1190.3999999999999
that are said by liars

1188.08 --> 1194.0
and they use things that are provably

1190.4 --> 1196.799
lies step away from that and focus

1194.0 --> 1198.64
on like what's real try to forget about

1196.799 --> 1201.039
the craziness and build with what you

1198.64 --> 1205.7990000000002
know is real do things with with what

1201.039 --> 1205.799
you know is real try to anticipate

1206.72 --> 1212.88
a growth situation based really only on

1210.48 --> 1213.919
what's real and not

1212.88 --> 1215.679
let the

1213.919 --> 1217.2800000000002
hysterical

1215.679 --> 1220.0
stories

1217.28 --> 1222.24
seep into the way you do things or the

1220.0 --> 1223.28
way you prepare things even

1222.24 --> 1224.559
right

1223.28 --> 1228.1589999999999
don't

1224.559 --> 1230.6399999999999
grow in with that

1228.159 --> 1232.64
grow separate from it

1230.64 --> 1235.64
like true like spiritual

1232.64 --> 1235.64
self-sufficiency

1236.0 --> 1240.32
it's a bit of a fuzzy word but i think

1238.559 --> 1242.559
that would

1240.32 --> 1244.1589999999999
bring the yeah

1242.559 --> 1246.48
bring it across spiritual

1244.159 --> 1249.919
self-sufficience don't let the craziness

1246.48 --> 1251.44
become part of how you build things

1249.919 --> 1253.44
right that would have been a better

1251.44 --> 1255.1200000000001
message instead of like oh we gotta

1253.44 --> 1257.28
explore the lands and then we have

1255.12 --> 1260.32
enough land and then all the problems go

1257.28 --> 1260.32
away yeah no

1260.64 --> 1264.64
it's not going to solve anything it's

1262.08 --> 1266.24
just going to move it again like

1264.64 --> 1268.48
it always does

1266.24 --> 1268.48
right

1270.08 --> 1273.6
finding new lands is all super

1271.679 --> 1274.88
exhilarating and there is a freedom for

1273.6 --> 1277.76
some time

1274.88 --> 1279.5200000000002
but the problems

1277.76 --> 1282.8799999999999
that you were

1279.52 --> 1285.44
going there for to go away from

1282.88 --> 1287.8400000000001
where you originally were they're always

1285.44 --> 1290.88
going to follow you you're going to

1287.84 --> 1292.6399999999999
bring them with you

1290.88 --> 1295.0390000000002
by

1292.64 --> 1297.3600000000001
wanting to ignore them

1295.039 --> 1299.52
and not resolve them and instead

1297.36 --> 1302.52
go away from them right so yeah

1299.52 --> 1302.52
complicated

1307.28 --> 1312.6399999999999
curved adjacents

1309.28 --> 1312.6399999999999
could be fun and exciting

1313.919 --> 1317.44
right

1315.12 --> 1320.4799999999998
well kevin k that's

1317.44 --> 1322.72
that's what my show is for isn't it

1320.48 --> 1324.32
i'm gonna say it now

1322.72 --> 1327.3600000000001
right but yeah the flat earth debate you

1324.32 --> 1330.72
gotta realize it is

1327.36 --> 1333.6
it's a combat arena it's

1330.72 --> 1337.1200000000001
it's main objective is not to entertain

1333.6 --> 1338.7199999999998
the listeners the main objective is to

1337.12 --> 1342.8799999999999
present

1338.72 --> 1344.4
the most efficient most focused weaponry

1342.88 --> 1346.4
against

1344.4 --> 1349.039
anti-flat earth

1346.4 --> 1349.039
fanatics

1349.6 --> 1354.559
and double think

1351.679 --> 1357.2
people in general it's against the whole

1354.559 --> 1358.72
demon spirit like that right that's what

1357.2 --> 1360.48
it's really for

1358.72 --> 1362.559
and that's why the curved adjacent and

1360.48 --> 1364.72
all that yeah i find it a bit bit boring

1362.559 --> 1366.72
too it's not something that i can like

1364.72 --> 1368.72
do a whole bunch with right it's

1366.72 --> 1370.88
technically correct

1368.72 --> 1373.679
it's just that

1370.88 --> 1376.72
it's not very exciting but it is

1373.679 --> 1376.72
effective though

1380.159 --> 1382.4
right

1382.64 --> 1389.2800000000002
it's gonna it's gonna move beyond that

1386.48 --> 1391.679
right especially if something new comes

1389.28 --> 1391.6789999999999
alike

1392.48 --> 1398.919
north pole talk it's more interesting

1395.12 --> 1398.9189999999999
what do you mean tara 306.

1422.4 --> 1428.5590000000002
they could make it so much better

1424.96 --> 1429.3600000000001
you mean the uh next level movie

1428.559 --> 1431.039
yeah

1429.36 --> 1433.9189999999999
they could have but they're just not

1431.039 --> 1433.919
focused on that

1434.559 --> 1439.6789999999999
they're it's really they're focused on

1436.96 --> 1442.8400000000001
advertising on trying to get through the

1439.679 --> 1445.679
people that aren't all that developed

1442.84 --> 1449.36
right so

1445.679 --> 1449.3600000000001
yeah it's not gonna have like

1451.2 --> 1455.8400000000001
it it can't be too far away from that or

1453.679 --> 1458.4
it's gonna be too high a threshold for

1455.84 --> 1462.0
people it's gonna scare them if you

1458.4 --> 1464.24
throw in every single detail right away

1462.0 --> 1464.24
right

1465.039 --> 1469.76
the land disappearing in north yeah yeah

1467.12 --> 1471.52
right yeah that it was curious right but

1469.76 --> 1474.32
it's still a bit of a reification

1471.52 --> 1476.4
because like what are they talking about

1474.32 --> 1478.3999999999999
how do they know that land was always

1476.4 --> 1480.0
there

1478.4 --> 1483.2
how do they know

1480.0 --> 1484.0
it literally like sank that's what you

1483.2 --> 1486.4
would

1484.0 --> 1488.96
conclude if you would

1486.4 --> 1491.919
go with the notion like yeah the maps

1488.96 --> 1493.039
are absolutely literal

1491.919 --> 1494.88
right

1493.039 --> 1496.72
but they don't know

1494.88 --> 1498.8400000000001
like what happened

1496.72 --> 1502.88
did did that land

1498.84 --> 1505.039
sink did the loop disconnect

1502.88 --> 1508.159
and thus the land suddenly wasn't

1505.039 --> 1508.1589999999999
connected anymore

1508.4 --> 1513.679
right

1509.52 --> 1516.559
or was it a fiction

1513.679 --> 1518.799
there was part of a myth maybe even like

1516.559 --> 1520.0
a cult of cartographers that would put

1518.799 --> 1522.0
it there

1520.0 --> 1524.32
based on their religion

1522.0 --> 1526.159
and the people would know better and by

1524.32 --> 1528.1589999999999
then presenting the maps

1526.159 --> 1530.0
they would kind of almost be forced to

1528.159 --> 1531.919
believe it right it could have been a

1530.0 --> 1532.799
wizard trick you don't know we don't

1531.919 --> 1534.7990000000002
know

1532.799 --> 1538.0
right we'd only know

1534.799 --> 1540.24
once we literally go to where we think

1538.0 --> 1542.48
these lands would have been

1540.24 --> 1545.6
and then check out the ocean bottom and

1542.48 --> 1548.08
see like are there like mountains

1545.6 --> 1549.52
mountain peaks there at the bottom

1548.08 --> 1552.6399999999999
in that pattern

1549.52 --> 1554.72
then you can then you can finally if you

1552.64 --> 1556.96
actually have some palpable proof for

1554.72 --> 1558.96
that then you can start to suggest like

1556.96 --> 1561.679
yeah there was this

1558.96 --> 1564.0
rocky island with the four rivers and it

1561.679 --> 1566.3200000000002
said look there's the mountain ranges

1564.0 --> 1569.6
literally there well

1566.32 --> 1570.6399999999999
the google map images did not yield

1569.6 --> 1571.9189999999999
anything

1570.64 --> 1573.44
like that

1571.919 --> 1575.279
right

1573.44 --> 1577.6000000000001
so yeah again again it's a bit of a

1575.279 --> 1579.76
reification

1577.6 --> 1581.9189999999999
but it's an interesting thing to address

1579.76 --> 1585.52
it's a mystery but it's more like a

1581.919 --> 1588.24
cartography mystery

1585.52 --> 1590.559
then it is like oh there's a super

1588.24 --> 1592.0
phenomenon there was these lands and it

1590.559 --> 1595.44
sank

1592.0 --> 1597.919
no you don't know that yet

1595.44 --> 1600.48
haven't actually done

1597.919 --> 1603.6000000000001
like haven't got palpable

1600.48 --> 1606.32
evidence for that yet the map is not

1603.6 --> 1608.799
the terrain it's not the evidence it's a

1606.32 --> 1611.799
suggestion

1608.799 --> 1611.799
right

1614.32 --> 1616.6399999999999
hmm

1621.84 --> 1628.6399999999999
the fifth element spirit either yeah

1625.2 --> 1631.679
well the fifth element ether spirit

1628.64 --> 1634.0800000000002
i mean the spirit ether is like

1631.679 --> 1636.64
yeah i'm not gonna try to prove that

1634.08 --> 1638.24
scientifically thanks

1636.64 --> 1640.64
but

1638.24 --> 1642.3990000000001
you can't make me

1640.64 --> 1645.679
like doubt

1642.399 --> 1647.6789999999999
my absolute trust that it's there

1645.679 --> 1649.76
i'm constantly

1647.679 --> 1651.3600000000001
doing things with it interacting with it

1649.76 --> 1653.2
reading it it's like

1651.36 --> 1656.0
yeah

1653.2 --> 1657.3600000000001
i mean you could call it like a pool of

1656.0 --> 1660.72
spirits

1657.36 --> 1662.32
it's like the the dormant telepathy

1660.72 --> 1664.64
or you could call it

1662.32 --> 1668.24
the spirit ether

1664.64 --> 1670.3200000000002
right you could call it all these things

1668.24 --> 1673.6
but it's not

1670.32 --> 1676.0
all the mystical

1673.6 --> 1678.9599999999998
physics related

1676.0 --> 1681.36
thing a medium that makes everything

1678.96 --> 1684.08
work the way it does right

1681.36 --> 1685.9189999999999
that's science fiction that's

1684.08 --> 1688.6399999999999
light ether

1685.919 --> 1690.3990000000001
and it's completely fallacious

1688.64 --> 1694.159
but yeah again there's

1690.399 --> 1696.08
four or maybe even five types of ether

1694.159 --> 1698.0
i said four once in the list but it is

1696.08 --> 1700.24
actually five right

1698.0 --> 1703.36
there's the light ether

1700.24 --> 1704.88
it's science fiction

1703.36 --> 1707.76
there's the

1704.88 --> 1709.5200000000002
electric ether tesla talked about that

1707.76 --> 1712.399
it's very different

1709.52 --> 1713.44
he tied it in perhaps but it's not it's

1712.399 --> 1715.12
separate

1713.44 --> 1717.3600000000001
it's just electricity in the air has

1715.12 --> 1720.2399999999998
nothing to do with a medium

1717.36 --> 1721.039
for things to work the way they do

1720.24 --> 1724.0
then

1721.039 --> 1726.799
there's the material the chemical ether

1724.0 --> 1729.919
you pass out when you use it

1726.799 --> 1732.6399999999999
and then there's the spirit ether

1729.919 --> 1736.7990000000002
thing we use our spiritual abilities

1732.64 --> 1740.24
with social like remote viewing

1736.799 --> 1742.8799999999999
reading who knows what what yeah spirit

1740.24 --> 1745.2
stuff but then there's also which one

1742.88 --> 1745.2
was it

1745.52 --> 1750.52
i lost it

1747.279 --> 1750.52
damn it

1753.84 --> 1756.399
oh yeah yeah

1755.12 --> 1758.799
of course

1756.399 --> 1760.7199999999998
there's the communication ether

1758.799 --> 1764.24
which is arguably

1760.72 --> 1767.44
using the electric ether right it's

1764.24 --> 1770.559
it's popularly used the either

1767.44 --> 1772.72
for radio radio signals it's the

1770.559 --> 1776.0
communication ether that's the fifth

1772.72 --> 1778.84
ether it's technological

1776.0 --> 1781.76
right so there you go you got five

1778.84 --> 1784.72
ethers and yeah that

1781.76 --> 1787.2
that ether that a lot of flat earthers

1784.72 --> 1790.24
like to think is the cause of everything

1787.2 --> 1792.159
that one is fiction

1790.24 --> 1794.3990000000001
space it's a mistake

1792.159 --> 1798.3990000000001
based on the presupposition that light

1794.399 --> 1800.559
is a wave like material waves and

1798.399 --> 1802.32
therefore secondary so there must be a

1800.559 --> 1805.52
primary medium

1802.32 --> 1808.559
for light to be able to be the way

1805.52 --> 1811.039
it is as a presupposed wave and that

1808.559 --> 1815.44
spawns this fictional medium that is

1811.039 --> 1817.12
then tied into all these weird anomalies

1815.44 --> 1818.72
yeah that's

1817.12 --> 1821.1999999999998
light ether

1818.72 --> 1822.64
it's wrong

1821.2 --> 1824.32
it really is i know it's very

1822.64 --> 1825.8400000000001
disappointing to some people that are

1824.32 --> 1829.52
like but what about all these things

1825.84 --> 1831.4399999999998
yeah well all these things tied in with

1829.52 --> 1833.44
supposed ether

1831.44 --> 1835.76
they're still there they're still

1833.44 --> 1839.6000000000001
interesting they're all little magical

1835.76 --> 1843.84
puzzles of things that you discover yeah

1839.6 --> 1846.399
but to then say it must be ether is just

1843.84 --> 1848.84
like attributing

1846.399 --> 1850.6399999999999
acceleration

1848.84 --> 1851.4399999999998
weight

1850.64 --> 1854.24
to

1851.44 --> 1856.64
and other things to gravity like but all

1854.24 --> 1859.44
these things like i'm dropping it it

1856.64 --> 1860.72
proves gravity no it doesn't

1859.44 --> 1862.0
it's one

1860.72 --> 1864.159
single thing

1862.0 --> 1866.48
there's different ways to approach that

1864.159 --> 1868.3200000000002
right but no they presuppose it's caused

1866.48 --> 1870.159
by gravity

1868.32 --> 1872.6399999999999
and all the pressure

1870.159 --> 1875.519
presupposed to be caused by gravity

1872.64 --> 1876.64
right well the ether follows the same

1875.519 --> 1879.279
pattern

1876.64 --> 1882.96
of presupposition all these little

1879.279 --> 1885.2
things out there interesting things

1882.96 --> 1887.519
then attributed but yeah but look at how

1885.2 --> 1890.24
electricity is doing this thing and like

1887.519 --> 1891.44
yeah but that's electricity it's doing a

1890.24 --> 1893.44
thing

1891.44 --> 1896.159
now you're presupposing that it's doing

1893.44 --> 1897.76
the thing because of ether

1896.159 --> 1899.7600000000002
you have no evidence for that and you

1897.76 --> 1902.24
could never prove that it's science

1899.76 --> 1902.24
fiction

1902.559 --> 1905.44
see

1904.32 --> 1907.76
and that's

1905.44 --> 1909.8400000000001
the problem with ether and that's why i

1907.76 --> 1912.48
now call it straightforward just

1909.84 --> 1914.399
declared it an aberration exactly like

1912.48 --> 1916.96
gravity it follows the exact same

1914.399 --> 1916.9599999999998
patterns

1917.2 --> 1922.72
through people and how they deal with it

1919.2 --> 1926.32
as they do with gravity

1922.72 --> 1927.84
right so that explains that

1926.32 --> 1931.6789999999999
my mic

1927.84 --> 1931.6789999999999
is clipping what are you talking about

1932.08 --> 1935.84
anybody else having audio issues

1940.32 --> 1944.48
i'm not seeing any anomalies here

1944.559 --> 1948.279
on my mic readout

1952.08 --> 1957.36
uh i forgot the technobabble ether

1955.44 --> 1960.0800000000002
no i didn't forget the techno battle

1957.36 --> 1961.1999999999998
ether i just explained it

1960.08 --> 1964.24
i just

1961.2 --> 1967.039
exactly expl the technobabble ether is

1964.24 --> 1969.2
all these is pointy it's like a list

1967.039 --> 1972.96
all these different

1969.2 --> 1975.1200000000001
separated little things out there

1972.96 --> 1978.3990000000001
that are like little mysteries it's an

1975.12 --> 1980.1589999999999
electrics it might be in lights mostly

1978.399 --> 1981.36
electrics though right and then they

1980.159 --> 1984.72
just say

1981.36 --> 1986.9599999999998
that proves the ether that's what it is

1984.72 --> 1990.08
it's all presupposition they just take

1986.96 --> 1993.1200000000001
little anomalies they

1990.08 --> 1994.799
like they they put them on a rope like

1993.12 --> 1995.84
beads they make this giant chain of

1994.799 --> 1998.24
beads

1995.84 --> 2001.36
all these little phenomena say this

1998.24 --> 2001.36
is the ether

2001.6 --> 2004.7199999999998
that's the same like what they do with

2003.12 --> 2008.7199999999998
the gravity

2004.72 --> 2008.72
more elaborate perhaps right

2010.24 --> 2017.32
now my clip okay good to hear

2012.799 --> 2017.32
i guess it's just you steamy traveler

2021.12 --> 2024.9599999999998
hey stop the traffic in my restaurant

2028.46 --> 2033.279
[Music]

2031.36 --> 2035.76
oh steamy travel have you just tried

2033.279 --> 2038.72
refreshing the browser

2035.76 --> 2041.919
browsers can have like weird

2038.72 --> 2044.3990000000001
unexpected glitches sometimes most

2041.919 --> 2044.3990000000001
browsers

2044.799 --> 2050.8
huh

2047.279 --> 2050.8
who have they defined ether

2052.0 --> 2056.72
well they're trying to define it they're

2054.56 --> 2056.72
just

2057.119 --> 2062.48
but it's basically all turning into like

2060.399 --> 2063.7599999999998
a giant b yeah

2062.48 --> 2066.919
strain

2063.76 --> 2066.9190000000003
of presuppositions

2084.159 --> 2087.159
what

2088.159 --> 2091.119
uh

2088.96 --> 2093.919
no thanks capric

2091.119 --> 2096.639
capric castle

2093.919 --> 2100.24
not ordering anything

2096.639 --> 2100.2400000000002
as the word soy in it

2100.64 --> 2103.64
uh

2123.839 --> 2128.2
i have no idea what you're talking about

2131.359 --> 2139.2799999999997
it's not those bad estrogen [ __ ] okay

2136.0 --> 2139.28
i'm still not doing it

2140.32 --> 2148.4
like i'm boycotting soy

2144.079 --> 2151.76
like i'm in the strong conviction that

2148.4 --> 2153.04
soy should not be like a majority crop

2151.76 --> 2155.2000000000003
in the world

2153.04 --> 2156.079
there's much better ways to actually

2155.2 --> 2159.2
farm

2156.079 --> 2161.44
that are more better for everybody

2159.2 --> 2161.4399999999996
right

2161.839 --> 2166.0
so yeah oh look what you could do with

2163.52 --> 2168.24
this with so and that was like no

2166.0 --> 2168.24
no

2171.76 --> 2174.4
i don't want it

2176.24 --> 2182.3999999999996
a topical treatment

2179.44 --> 2183.76
no soy boys right

2182.4 --> 2186.079
because like oh look at what you could

2183.76 --> 2188.8
do with soy with this and with that yeah

2186.079 --> 2190.8
and then at the same time

2188.8 --> 2192.079
the soy latte industry is going to be

2190.8 --> 2193.6800000000003
like yeah

2192.079 --> 2194.6400000000003
that's going to make it even cheaper for

2193.68 --> 2195.9199999999996
me

2194.64 --> 2198.64
ah that's

2195.92 --> 2200.8
more soy lattes for everybody like oh we

2198.64 --> 2202.24
can just give it away for free now oh

2200.8 --> 2203.28
yes

2202.24 --> 2206.72
like

2203.28 --> 2209.92
yeah one soy industry is going to

2206.72 --> 2212.9199999999996
like automatically boost another

2209.92 --> 2212.92
so

2214.64 --> 2220.8799999999997
i once saw palmetto

2218.32 --> 2223.6800000000003
i yeah i do appreciate that

2220.88 --> 2225.04
what against hair loss i don't know i

2223.68 --> 2227.5989999999997
just like it

2225.04 --> 2231.359
not i'm not taking anything against hair

2227.599 --> 2231.3590000000004
loss i don't fear hair loss

2232.8 --> 2237.76
i mean yeah i'm gonna lose it eventually

2236.24 --> 2241.7599999999998
but

2237.76 --> 2243.92
my hair is pretty remarkable

2241.76 --> 2246.1600000000003
i think i'm very happy with my hair i do

2243.92 --> 2248.079
my best to just treat it right

2246.16 --> 2249.839
if i'm just going to be like oh no i'm

2248.079 --> 2251.3590000000004
going to lose it yeah guess what's going

2249.839 --> 2253.2799999999997
to happen

2251.359 --> 2256.0
yeah it's going to cause stress it's

2253.28 --> 2258.48
going to cause like focus with with not

2256.0 --> 2260.24
good intent with fear

2258.48 --> 2262.64
is actually gonna make things worse so

2260.24 --> 2265.4399999999996
i'm just like no

2262.64 --> 2265.44
i'm okay

2266.4 --> 2271.76
you know what the best way to not lose

2268.72 --> 2274.0789999999997
your hair is not stressing yourself the

2271.76 --> 2276.96
[ __ ] out so that you accidentally pull

2274.079 --> 2276.96
out your own hair

2301.04 --> 2304.04
okay

2334.64 --> 2339.72
your hip to the rest okay

2342.4 --> 2346.8
i mean look if something's out there

2344.24 --> 2349.7599999999998
that really works yeah i might try it at

2346.8 --> 2351.599
some point even it's just that

2349.76 --> 2355.0
i'm just trying to keep everything the

2351.599 --> 2355.0
way it is

2356.4 --> 2362.56
like i don't have a lot of money to

2359.76 --> 2364.6400000000003
like try out a whole bunch of new things

2362.56 --> 2366.48
then potentially get stuck to that and

2364.64 --> 2369.2799999999997
then what if i certainly can't pay for

2366.48 --> 2372.48
it anymore will i end up losing more

2369.28 --> 2375.44
than i started out with right

2372.48 --> 2378.16
it's part of my policy

2375.44 --> 2380.96
like don't try anything unless you know

2378.16 --> 2382.8799999999997
you can actually

2380.96 --> 2384.7200000000003
use it in a way that you're not gonna

2382.88 --> 2386.1600000000003
end up losing more than you started out

2384.72 --> 2389.16
with

2386.16 --> 2389.16
anyways

2401.76 --> 2407.0
okay kevin k

2403.52 --> 2407.0
talk to you later

2429.839 --> 2433.7599999999998
oh man i'm hungry

2431.21 --> 2436.319
[Music]

2433.76 --> 2438.3190000000004
i made an official croissant complaint

2436.319 --> 2440.88
to the store

2438.319 --> 2440.88
i did it

2441.119 --> 2446.319
and it was well received i really said

2443.44 --> 2448.7200000000003
like yeah this is not working i mean

2446.319 --> 2451.839
there's these are not really the these

2448.72 --> 2455.52
are not the croissants we're looking for

2451.839 --> 2458.64
and like everybody wants them

2455.52 --> 2462.24
and like she even liked them so like the

2458.64 --> 2464.319
one in the store so she knows like yes

2462.24 --> 2467.359
you're right so i asked like can you

2464.319 --> 2469.44
make an official inquiry

2467.359 --> 2471.52
or a complaint about yeah this is

2469.44 --> 2473.76
nonsense we want the real croissants and

2471.52 --> 2476.56
we need plenty because everybody likes

2473.76 --> 2476.5600000000004
them this is

2476.8 --> 2480.079
like

2477.56 --> 2482.88
counterproductive for this standard

2480.079 --> 2484.1600000000003
store policy you want to sell [ __ ] so

2482.88 --> 2486.4
sell it

2484.16 --> 2488.7999999999997
sell it already

2486.4 --> 2488.8
anyway

2490.079 --> 2495.04
kind of hungry but it will have like it

2493.04 --> 2496.88
i have a new type of lunch i don't eat

2495.04 --> 2499.119
pizzas anymore and they were like too

2496.88 --> 2500.6400000000003
expensive anyway

2499.119 --> 2502.4
but now

2500.64 --> 2504.64
i get like a

2502.4 --> 2505.839
that uh yeah

2504.64 --> 2509.04
spelt

2505.839 --> 2511.52
sourdough thai bread

2509.04 --> 2513.52
that i like bake in the oven last

2511.52 --> 2515.28
finishing bake

2513.52 --> 2516.16
then i

2515.28 --> 2518.96
put

2516.16 --> 2520.0
the basically slice up tomato i peel it

2518.96 --> 2521.839
first

2520.0 --> 2523.599
and i slice up in little little little

2521.839 --> 2526.72
bit pieces

2523.599 --> 2528.8
tomato like half a tomato for one bread

2526.72 --> 2530.24
and yeah add

2528.8 --> 2532.319
chopped up

2530.24 --> 2533.2799999999997
chili peppers

2532.319 --> 2537.16
and then

2533.28 --> 2537.1600000000003
yeah beef salami

2539.28 --> 2543.76
and like you don't use butter or

2540.96 --> 2545.359
anything just use the tomato

2543.76 --> 2547.44
and just because it needs to be little

2545.359 --> 2550.56
bits and then like chop it up and like

2547.44 --> 2552.079
push it into the bread a bit like if if

2550.56 --> 2554.56
there's like from the chopping up

2552.079 --> 2555.6800000000003
there's like this tomato

2554.56 --> 2556.64
uh

2555.68 --> 2558.24
juice

2556.64 --> 2560.319
from that then

2558.24 --> 2562.3999999999996
especially that pour that on the bread

2560.319 --> 2565.52
because you want it to soak in

2562.4 --> 2566.88
and then put it together with the salami

2565.52 --> 2570.079
and the pepper

2566.88 --> 2570.079
it's like the best

2571.04 --> 2576.16
the best type of bread for like great

2573.28 --> 2578.3190000000004
weather for picnic or like going to the

2576.16 --> 2580.8799999999997
beach that's how i originally learned

2578.319 --> 2583.92
about it you have to like a big baguette

2580.88 --> 2585.92
with salami and chopped up tomatoes and

2583.92 --> 2589.04
like a big one

2585.92 --> 2591.28
best ever for like on the beach

2589.04 --> 2592.88
when it's hot

2591.28 --> 2594.7200000000003
amazing stuff

2592.88 --> 2596.88
so i'm having those it's actually

2594.72 --> 2598.24
turning out to be cheaper than pizza so

2596.88 --> 2599.92
and it's

2598.24 --> 2600.8799999999997
better

2599.92 --> 2602.4
so

2600.88 --> 2605.119
looking forward to that now i made

2602.4 --> 2606.96
myself even more hungry

2605.119 --> 2609.28
still have

2606.96 --> 2612.92
like an hour and 20 minutes to go before

2609.28 --> 2612.92
i can eat that

2632.48 --> 2637.599
okay rastad well look if there's

2634.88 --> 2638.7200000000003
something yeah you're talking

2637.599 --> 2641.28
about

2638.72 --> 2641.2799999999997
this stuff

2641.599 --> 2645.2000000000003
i don't really know what to do with it

2647.52 --> 2649.839
i mean

2654.4 --> 2660.0
like what do you do it's like a gel you

2656.72 --> 2662.16
just put it in your head or something

2660.0 --> 2664.96
do you leave it there you wash it off

2662.16 --> 2664.96
like i don't know

2665.839 --> 2669.2
how well does it really work

2670.88 --> 2674.319
or is it just like oh you only have to

2672.72 --> 2677.2799999999997
do that the rest of your life in your

2674.319 --> 2681.319
hair will kind of stay the same

2677.28 --> 2681.3190000000004
so yeah i don't know

2698.48 --> 2701.88
best bagels

2717.119 --> 2721.52
bagel is like a

2720.16 --> 2723.1189999999997
donut

2721.52 --> 2724.319
sandwich

2723.119 --> 2726.7200000000003
something

2724.319 --> 2726.72
okay

2730.56 --> 2737.96
or update you works okay that's good i'd

2733.04 --> 2737.96
love to hear about that caprica so

2747.599 --> 2753.92
like my general experience is that

2750.64 --> 2755.5989999999997
people that start to lose their hair

2753.92 --> 2759.04
in their late teens

2755.599 --> 2761.2000000000003
they're the ones that really lose it

2759.04 --> 2762.48
and then those that don't go through

2761.2 --> 2766.16
that

2762.48 --> 2768.4
they just kind of slow my slightest thin

2766.16 --> 2772.48
out a little and then

2768.4 --> 2774.64
usually like between 50 and 60

2772.48 --> 2777.04
it partially goes

2774.64 --> 2780.24
but then they like yeah they

2777.04 --> 2782.4
they usually metamorphose

2780.24 --> 2783.52
in their looks anyway to become

2782.4 --> 2785.2000000000003
different

2783.52 --> 2787.7599999999998
so usually just it's like a

2785.2 --> 2790.319
metamorphosis and

2787.76 --> 2790.3190000000004
it's different

2790.48 --> 2793.2
so i don't know

2795.28 --> 2800.0
you may never get in the balls yeah well

2797.52 --> 2801.04
i hope so

2800.0 --> 2804.24
but

2801.04 --> 2805.119
it's difficult because my dad is

2804.24 --> 2807.839
like

2805.119 --> 2810.56
well he it's just like my dad's the same

2807.839 --> 2813.2
but he like didn't go with the long hair

2810.56 --> 2815.44
and he's like yeah i just

2813.2 --> 2820.0789999999997
i'm just letting it be like weird

2815.44 --> 2820.079
whatever confused professor sort of look

2821.2 --> 2824.16
patchy and [ __ ]

2824.4 --> 2827.2000000000003
it's fine though like

2826.079 --> 2830.6400000000003
he's still

2827.2 --> 2834.2799999999997
yeah he still looks cool and very young

2830.64 --> 2834.2799999999997
for his age so

2848.88 --> 2853.28
right stop that's interesting stuff a

2850.96 --> 2855.44
trafficking arrest had yeah

2853.28 --> 2855.44
so

2855.92 --> 2861.119
how does that how would that work if

2857.76 --> 2863.92
that like the young guy is getting it

2861.119 --> 2866.6400000000003
so is that like a temporary face where

2863.92 --> 2868.16
phase where it just happens then you

2866.64 --> 2870.0789999999997
have to do it then or is that a thing

2868.16 --> 2872.16
that like you have to like put that

2870.079 --> 2874.4
stuff on your head the rest of your life

2872.16 --> 2875.359
and if you forget it like once

2874.4 --> 2877.119
uh

2875.359 --> 2878.96
for like a week

2877.119 --> 2881.359
your hair just goes is it would it be

2878.96 --> 2885.079
like that

2881.359 --> 2885.0789999999997
how would that work

2900.72 --> 2903.04
hmm

2906.64 --> 2911.839
right that's directly testosterone okay

2909.44 --> 2915.68
then it should only be temporary because

2911.839 --> 2918.48
your testosterone does go down as you

2915.68 --> 2918.48
grow older

2918.8 --> 2921.3590000000004
interesting

2922.16 --> 2925.839
i'll try to keep that in mind

2924.16 --> 2927.7599999999998
i mean if there's ever a guy that's like

2925.839 --> 2930.64
oh no i think i might be losing my hair

2927.76 --> 2932.7200000000003
i'll i'll try to remember that

2930.64 --> 2934.16
if a young guy starts like

2932.72 --> 2936.8799999999997
says yeah

2934.16 --> 2939.68
i think maybe like i killed the hope

2936.88 --> 2942.4
could use something with that

2939.68 --> 2945.2799999999997
i mean he he was like not satisfied

2942.4 --> 2947.2000000000003
about his hair it was fine to me like

2945.28 --> 2949.8390000000004
it's not

2947.2 --> 2951.7599999999998
super perfect like union moderate

2949.839 --> 2954.48
perfect how but

2951.76 --> 2956.559
like he looked like a really cool guy

2954.48 --> 2959.68
despite all that so but i don't know

2956.559 --> 2959.6800000000003
maybe he could use that

2963.92 --> 2969.64
it's gone for oh [ __ ]

2966.64 --> 2969.64
hmm

2979.119 --> 2983.2400000000002
yeah hazards of testosterone

3010.8 --> 3013.8390000000004
right anyway

3016.559 --> 3020.48
interesting

3017.839 --> 3022.16
keep it in the back of my mind

3020.48 --> 3024.079
that that that there is something with

3022.16 --> 3025.7599999999998
it oh yeah i got a gusto

3024.079 --> 3028.0
by the way

3025.76 --> 3031.3190000000004
get this thing open

3028.0 --> 3031.319
right here

3040.21 --> 3043.239
[Music]

3058.96 --> 3061.92
oh right

3065.04 --> 3068.7599999999998
i would never subscribe

3084.88 --> 3088.599
all right so

3110.16 --> 3115.2
man sometimes i sit so still

3112.8 --> 3118.48
i'm looking at the screen and i'm like

3115.2 --> 3118.48
wait did i just freeze

3118.72 --> 3122.72
but it's just me sitting really still

3123.04 --> 3128.889
yeah anyway

3125.69 --> 3128.889
[Music]

3133.839 --> 3139.04
right so we're just talking about my

3136.16 --> 3141.7599999999998
lunch and the rest i had

3139.04 --> 3141.7599999999998
capri soul

3142.48 --> 3147.04
started talking

3144.24 --> 3147.04
hair loss

3147.359 --> 3151.44
it's not exactly

3149.68 --> 3154.5589999999997
a subject i want to spend the rest of

3151.44 --> 3154.559
the early bird show with

3162.16 --> 3165.359
sorry about it's fine

3165.68 --> 3170.0
i mean it's good to know it's just not

3167.52 --> 3172.319
like oh yeah man let's talk about that

3170.0 --> 3174.559
it's not because i'm not super

3172.319 --> 3178.16
interested i never had that problem i

3174.559 --> 3178.1600000000003
knew a couple of guys that did

3179.52 --> 3185.28
and they pretty much all just decided to

3182.319 --> 3185.2799999999997
go full bald

3187.119 --> 3192.119
or as i like to call them they turned

3189.119 --> 3192.119
mercurian

3195.92 --> 3200.7200000000003
well that technically

3197.52 --> 3203.119
that only works if you're also gay

3200.72 --> 3203.1189999999997
anyway

3207.52 --> 3210.559
remember that thing

3212.24 --> 3217.319
probably not i think i like mentioned it

3214.319 --> 3217.319
once

3228.96 --> 3233.68
and yeah it's not like oh this is heavy

3231.839 --> 3236.88
priesthood knowledge it's more like my

3233.68 --> 3240.0
own personal thing it's just like yeah

3236.88 --> 3242.079
guys that are like

3240.0 --> 3244.16
salesmen

3242.079 --> 3246.079
like or at least they're like really

3244.16 --> 3248.0
good at addressing

3246.079 --> 3252.8
a group of people right and they

3248.0 --> 3256.96
typically like to play on them and like

3252.8 --> 3259.119
make everybody respect them a lot

3256.96 --> 3261.52
and they're usually gay

3259.119 --> 3264.079
but not like super overtly but they

3261.52 --> 3267.119
usually are gay and they're always like

3264.079 --> 3269.44
super ball headed most of them like

3267.119 --> 3270.4
to wear suits right that's what i would

3269.44 --> 3273.2000000000003
call a

3270.4 --> 3273.2000000000003
mercurian

3276.16 --> 3279.839
and

3277.04 --> 3279.839
yeah

3280.0 --> 3285.2
because it's just like

3282.64 --> 3287.839
why do i call the mercurian because like

3285.2 --> 3290.16
mercurius is would be like the symbol of

3287.839 --> 3293.599
trade

3290.16 --> 3294.96
new ideas and like

3293.599 --> 3297.2000000000003
energy flow

3294.96 --> 3297.2
right

3297.359 --> 3301.359
yeah

3298.079 --> 3302.96
ball held the suit dressing gaze yeah

3301.359 --> 3305.92
pretty much

3302.96 --> 3307.839
that's what i call mercurians why

3305.92 --> 3310.0
because they just remind me about

3307.839 --> 3312.16
mercury it's like that's the power they

3310.0 --> 3314.799
seek and they gave everything to it and

3312.16 --> 3314.799
they love it

3315.04 --> 3320.48
i mean mercurians usually really like

3318.72 --> 3323.2799999999997
being that way

3320.48 --> 3326.72
like arguably

3323.28 --> 3330.7200000000003
uh which is called again bezos

3326.72 --> 3330.72
he is a mercurian

3331.839 --> 3335.52
like

3332.64 --> 3336.72
if there ever was one right

3335.52 --> 3338.24
i mean

3336.72 --> 3342.1189999999997
right

3338.24 --> 3342.1189999999997
it's top dog mercurian

3349.839 --> 3355.2
right i'm not saying that if you're bald

3351.92 --> 3357.04
you're automatically gay by the way

3355.2 --> 3359.68
especially if you have like a pretty

3357.04 --> 3360.799
badass beard under there

3359.68 --> 3362.8799999999997
right

3360.799 --> 3366.0
that's not gay that that's not what i

3362.88 --> 3368.559
would say it's just specifically like

3366.0 --> 3370.16
tightly shaved like

3368.559 --> 3372.079
real mercurians never have like a

3370.16 --> 3375.1189999999997
mustache or a beard

3372.079 --> 3376.96
or maybe they have like a goatee

3375.119 --> 3379.359
right maybe

3376.96 --> 3380.96
but usually they're because that's like

3379.359 --> 3384.799
extra gains

3380.96 --> 3384.799
usually they're just completely bald

3385.2 --> 3391.52
but the gay is an important factor

3388.16 --> 3393.2
and most of them like to wear suits

3391.52 --> 3395.839
and usually does kind of look kind of

3393.2 --> 3395.839
cool on them

3397.599 --> 3402.96
and they're always like

3399.68 --> 3405.5989999999997
always with the guys busy with business

3402.96 --> 3409.559
and deals and

3405.599 --> 3409.559
that sort of [ __ ] parties

3420.48 --> 3425.839
i mean maybe some of these mercurians

3422.48 --> 3429.04
and i i'm purely guessing at this point

3425.839 --> 3431.68
only very vague connections with having

3429.04 --> 3434.16
seen things sort of at parties when like

3431.68 --> 3434.96
would say 30 years ago or something

3434.16 --> 3437.04
the

3434.96 --> 3438.7200000000003
mercurians probably like to surround

3437.04 --> 3440.48
themselves by

3438.72 --> 3441.4399999999996
like attracting women

3440.48 --> 3443.359
to

3441.44 --> 3447.28
haul in men

3443.359 --> 3450.96
so they can test if they're actually gay

3447.28 --> 3450.96
secretly at parties

3451.44 --> 3455.119
that would be very mercurian

3454.06 --> 3458.4
[Music]

3455.119 --> 3458.4
i don't know why

3458.48 --> 3464.2400000000002
why

3461.44 --> 3464.96
it's just a weird thing it's maybe like

3464.24 --> 3468.64
a

3464.96 --> 3471.64
side effect of my homophobia

3468.64 --> 3471.64
right

3474.64 --> 3480.0789999999997
but i've met like several

3477.2 --> 3480.0789999999997
guys like that

3483.92 --> 3490.4
it's so typical it's like i get them i

3487.76 --> 3493.0400000000004
get what they want

3490.4 --> 3496.0
i mostly like to actually help them out

3493.04 --> 3498.96
except that when i do that

3496.0 --> 3501.119
then they actually want they like

3498.96 --> 3502.96
because i want to help them they start

3501.119 --> 3504.559
along to get in my pants and that's

3502.96 --> 3508.76
where i'm like no

3504.559 --> 3508.76
and that's where it's ruined so

3517.599 --> 3524.3590000000004
because i i can like sense that

3521.359 --> 3524.359
right

3542.839 --> 3547.2
hmm pumpkin seed oil

3548.72 --> 3553.7599999999998
okay that's interesting

3551.359 --> 3556.64
georgetown i didn't know that

3553.76 --> 3560.2400000000002
pumpkin seed oil

3556.64 --> 3560.24
increases hair growth that's

3560.319 --> 3565.04
it

3561.2 --> 3565.04
what you're sourcing for that though

3565.119 --> 3569.92
i mean if you find that in one source

3567.04 --> 3573.839
that's one thing but like if there is

3569.92 --> 3573.839
like multiple indications of that

3587.28 --> 3592.1600000000003
right way yeah i arrest that i know

3590.64 --> 3595.52
it's a different problem we get that

3592.16 --> 3599.24
what what what you talked about earlier

3595.52 --> 3599.24
about the uh

3600.48 --> 3605.92
testosterone being transformed into that

3603.119 --> 3608.6400000000003
chemical that causes that

3605.92 --> 3611.359
rapid hair loss yeah it doesn't stop

3608.64 --> 3611.359
that i know

3611.68 --> 3614.68
right

3615.599 --> 3618.88
yeah dht

3619.04 --> 3625.5589999999997
could you like

3620.559 --> 3625.559
spell that out the entire name

3632.46 --> 3635.619
[Music]

3644.72 --> 3647.72
dihydrotestosterone

3648.72 --> 3652.16
oh

3649.839 --> 3652.16
okay

3653.28 --> 3657.76
hi

3654.96 --> 3659.68
way so it's basically two

3657.76 --> 3661.3590000000004
hydrogen

3659.68 --> 3662.799
atoms

3661.359 --> 3665.5989999999997
chemically

3662.799 --> 3669.24
connected to testosterone

3665.599 --> 3669.2400000000002
is that what it is

3671.2 --> 3674.2
hmm

3691.359 --> 3694.5989999999997
or anyway

3698.24 --> 3701.68
it's

3700.16 --> 3703.1189999999997
rigged

3701.68 --> 3705.5989999999997
that's amazing

3703.119 --> 3709.839
don't listen to george sanford he has

3705.599 --> 3712.88
stocks in big pumpkin i love it

3709.839 --> 3715.7599999999998
i mean i'd support big pumpkin

3712.88 --> 3719.599
as long as they don't

3715.76 --> 3719.599
i don't know as long as they don't make

3720.16 --> 3727.48
hair loss illegal or something right

3723.2 --> 3727.48
then would start to suck

3731.92 --> 3736.0
i mean big pumpkin

3733.68 --> 3738.24
yeah eventually if a corporation or an

3736.0 --> 3740.24
organization becomes big enough it will

3738.24 --> 3741.7599999999998
start to nag and they might like oh look

3740.24 --> 3744.0789999999997
we got these new

3741.76 --> 3746.7200000000003
we got these new vaccines and

3744.079 --> 3749.76
you really need it

3746.72 --> 3752.3999999999996
to prevent rapid hair loss

3749.76 --> 3752.4
and then like

3752.64 --> 3756.48
enormous amounts of people take it and

3754.88 --> 3759.039
like are forced by the government

3756.48 --> 3760.64
because of media panic and all that

3759.039 --> 3762.2400000000002
and then suddenly all these people start

3760.64 --> 3764.96
losing their hair it's like

3762.24 --> 3767.1189999999997
yeah we have the solution

3764.96 --> 3769.76
to the problem that because all the

3767.119 --> 3771.839
people that didn't take it

3769.76 --> 3776.48
right caused all the people that took it

3771.839 --> 3776.48
to lose their hair so we got a solution

3776.96 --> 3781.119
what is it again

3778.559 --> 3783.039
seed oil

3781.119 --> 3785.52
pumpkin seed oil is pretty yeah let's

3783.039 --> 3789.92
just call it pumpkin seed oil

3785.52 --> 3789.92
yeah it just it really helps

3790.16 --> 3797.0389999999998
and so they're gonna then yeah use

3793.119 --> 3799.359
vaccines and spread media hysteria to

3797.039 --> 3801.8390000000004
invoke hair loss

3799.359 --> 3804.0789999999997
which would then up their stocks because

3801.839 --> 3809.0389999999998
suddenly everybody's gonna seek a remedy

3804.079 --> 3809.039
against that after being forced to yeah

3809.119 --> 3812.7200000000003
do all this stupid [ __ ] that didn't make

3811.119 --> 3815.599
any sense and actually caused the hair

3812.72 --> 3816.799
loss and then the the pumpkin seed

3815.599 --> 3818.48
oil

3816.799 --> 3820.799
is gonna be in higher demand and then

3818.48 --> 3825.16
they're gonna make a killing that's what

3820.799 --> 3825.16
big pumpkin would do

3829.839 --> 3835.359
right and and maybe the dht blocker

3833.2 --> 3836.8799999999997
would also start to get involved they'd

3835.359 --> 3839.52
probably be

3836.88 --> 3842.079
joined conjoined together like it would

3839.52 --> 3844.88
be the pumpkin

3842.079 --> 3847.119
big pumpkin would also include that

3844.88 --> 3849.839
of course it would have a monopoly on

3847.119 --> 3852.7200000000003
all hair

3849.839 --> 3855.2
yeah hair related products they would be

3852.72 --> 3857.839
like big hair really it's not even bit

3855.2 --> 3859.4399999999996
big pumpkin they would be big hair

3857.839 --> 3862.799
it's like a

3859.44 --> 3866.68
specialist branch of the

3862.799 --> 3866.68
of the medical department

3867.44 --> 3873.799
and they would try to take over the

3868.88 --> 3873.799
world as all mega corporations try

3907.44 --> 3911.28
okay so nobody thought that was funny

3912.72 --> 3918.48
the imaginary

3914.48 --> 3918.48
big big pumpkin big hair

3920.48 --> 3923.839
the big hair corporation

3924.16 --> 3927.3999999999996
come on

3936.319 --> 3941.359
oh yeah i would have to state that in

3939.039 --> 3944.4
big hair there would be like

3941.359 --> 3946.48
kind of a discriminatory policy secret

3944.4 --> 3949.6800000000003
of course like always

3946.48 --> 3951.52
because only people that have like

3949.68 --> 3953.839
really heavy hair

3951.52 --> 3956.079
like afro-type hair

3953.839 --> 3958.88
would would probably be allowed to be

3956.079 --> 3961.8390000000004
representatives right

3958.88 --> 3964.4
so that wherever big hair is present and

3961.839 --> 3968.799
speaking it would be

3964.4 --> 3968.799
hello man we know about her

3976.88 --> 3981.6400000000003
we got all the hair in the world

4002.48 --> 4008.319
because i mean

4004.64 --> 4009.52
what bigger grabble would there be

4008.319 --> 4011.2
than

4009.52 --> 4013.2
you know

4011.2 --> 4014.64
than to convince black people that

4013.2 --> 4016.24
they're gonna lose their hair when

4014.64 --> 4018.839
they're like

4016.24 --> 4021.68
pretty widely known to have like the

4018.839 --> 4023.7599999999998
strongest most tenacious

4021.68 --> 4024.64
hair

4023.76 --> 4027.2000000000003
of

4024.64 --> 4030.0
like all the different peoples

4027.2 --> 4033.0
on the on the world in the world

4030.0 --> 4033.0
right

4037.76 --> 4043.8390000000004
yes i don't know

4040.559 --> 4045.119
getting weird from mercurians to big

4043.839 --> 4048.24
hair

4045.119 --> 4050.559
mega corporation

4048.24 --> 4052.8799999999997
this is getting kind of weird today's

4050.559 --> 4052.88
show

4055.039 --> 4058.7990000000004
all right in the meantime stop the

4056.96 --> 4060.88
traffic in my restaurant and capricorn

4058.799 --> 4063.839
or having a private conversation in my

4060.88 --> 4063.839
chat

4064.48 --> 4066.88
about

4067.039 --> 4071.88
hair

4068.079 --> 4071.88
product chemistry

4090.4 --> 4094.319
is anybody else still there

4096.88 --> 4102.12
i don't necessarily want to talk about

4099.12 --> 4102.12
hair

4108.799 --> 4112.159
it's called hasa

4117.199 --> 4119.839
okay

4141.839 --> 4145.799
oh borders but yeah

4146.08 --> 4149.92
they want to pale it up don't they

4151.759 --> 4156.159
oh anyway that's in ways that is

4154.08 --> 4158.48
everywhere though like india is also

4156.159 --> 4161.719
doing that

4158.48 --> 4161.718999999999
it's just

4165.44 --> 4169.919999999999
yeah

4166.88 --> 4172.799
it's kind of it sounds weird it's racist

4169.92 --> 4173.759
but it's racist towards their own

4172.799 --> 4176.88
it's

4173.759 --> 4180.839
like ah you're not pale enough

4176.88 --> 4180.839
you not noble skin

4220.64 --> 4224.2390000000005
right but you have to realize though

4222.4 --> 4226.639999999999
that there's been a thing like

4224.239 --> 4230.718999999999
especially in east asia

4226.64 --> 4231.679
like japan too and korea i think and

4230.719 --> 4233.6
china

4231.679 --> 4235.1990000000005
where

4233.6 --> 4239.280000000001
it's like this

4235.199 --> 4242.08
this porcelain ideal right

4239.28 --> 4244.5599999999995
where they like put like geishas for

4242.08 --> 4246.32
example they're putting up like super

4244.56 --> 4249.84
white makeup

4246.32 --> 4252.799999999999
like super white like like a porcelain

4249.84 --> 4257.12
figurine right

4252.8 --> 4258.400000000001
so that's oh that is it is really asian

4257.12 --> 4262.64
to do that

4258.4 --> 4262.639999999999
like in their roots they have that thing

4264.48 --> 4270.159
i mean maybe in one form or another that

4266.8 --> 4273.76
has also existed like in

4270.159 --> 4276.0
in like western europe here and there

4273.76 --> 4280.320000000001
but

4276.0 --> 4280.32
yeah there's not a lot left of that

4281.92 --> 4287.76
so

4283.52 --> 4290.64
like shamed into multiculturalism now

4287.76 --> 4291.4400000000005
i can't believe there's like really pale

4290.64 --> 4293.92
like

4291.44 --> 4295.919999999999
white and

4293.92 --> 4297.84
slightly blond-haired naturally

4295.92 --> 4300.8
blond-haired ladies or something out

4297.84 --> 4302.08
there and guys that are like oh i'm too

4300.8 --> 4305.12
pale

4302.08 --> 4308.44
i don't get that i really don't but it

4305.12 --> 4308.44
does exist

4320.719 --> 4325.679
although yeah although like look even

4323.28 --> 4327.36
being having a pale skin is not always

4325.679 --> 4329.6
that great

4327.36 --> 4333.199
right you get more issues with the sun

4329.6 --> 4336.4400000000005
getting sunburned easier

4333.199 --> 4336.44
it's different

4343.12 --> 4349.599999999999
and to be and yeah fair

4346.0 --> 4352.32
like not all super blonde

4349.6 --> 4354.719
women are necessarily all very gorgeous

4352.32 --> 4354.719
looking

4354.84 --> 4359.360000000001
right

4356.64 --> 4361.360000000001
just because you're like pale skin or

4359.36 --> 4363.759999999999
like a natural blonde that doesn't

4361.36 --> 4368.44
automatically make you a beautiful

4363.76 --> 4368.4400000000005
person or have a beautiful personality

4372.64 --> 4375.92
indians in white face

4376.48 --> 4381.5199999999995
yeah well the aboriginals used to do it

4379.12 --> 4384.88
like dude there's all kinds of africans

4381.52 --> 4389.360000000001
that use white face are are we gonna

4384.88 --> 4391.76
like disrupt like their tribal

4389.36 --> 4393.599999999999
dances and shin and like how dare you

4391.76 --> 4395.6
put on white face

4393.6 --> 4397.84
african men

4395.6 --> 4399.84
you're appropriating our culture you're

4397.84 --> 4402.08
trying to shame us by putting on that

4399.84 --> 4404.96
white paint on your face

4402.08 --> 4404.96
how dare you

4405.44 --> 4407.759999999999
i mean

4408.08 --> 4410.48
yeah

4410.56 --> 4415.360000000001
see how ridiculous that sounds

4413.12 --> 4416.96
oh that's how ridiculous it sounds to me

4415.36 --> 4417.839999999999
when people

4416.96 --> 4419.76
here

4417.84 --> 4422.97
start whining about

4419.76 --> 4424.719
black pete's oh blackface how dare you

4422.97 --> 4429.1990000000005
[Music]

4424.719 --> 4431.92
like uh no they're telling a story

4429.199 --> 4434.5599999999995
it's a reenactment of a story is

4431.92 --> 4436.64
partially fictional but it's it's the

4434.56 --> 4437.6
dutch culture

4436.64 --> 4440.320000000001
and

4437.6 --> 4442.88
like i there shouldn't be an objection

4440.32 --> 4445.44
they're not being shamed they're not

4442.88 --> 4448.719
it's not racist it's ridiculous to think

4445.44 --> 4450.879999999999
that just as much as it is ridiculous

4448.719 --> 4453.36
to like complain

4450.88 --> 4455.36
to some african

4453.36 --> 4457.28
tribe like that's like old-fashioned

4455.36 --> 4458.5599999999995
tribe which is pretty cool by the way i

4457.28 --> 4460.4
think

4458.56 --> 4462.719
i'm not against like

4460.4 --> 4464.639999999999
i guess more primitive like even to call

4462.719 --> 4467.52
it a primitive form of life is already

4464.64 --> 4470.400000000001
like wrong it's just not

4467.52 --> 4470.400000000001
urbanite

4471.76 --> 4476.320000000001
like a more natural old-fashioned

4474.32 --> 4479.28
it's hard to pinpoint i'm just going to

4476.32 --> 4481.5199999999995
call it try with like tribesmen there do

4479.28 --> 4483.12
rituals and they have like put white

4481.52 --> 4485.040000000001
face on and they do dance around the

4483.12 --> 4486.159
fire are you gonna complain to them how

4485.04 --> 4488.159
dare you

4486.159 --> 4491.12
yeah they've been doing that

4488.159 --> 4492.799999999999
for countless generations in a tradition

4491.12 --> 4493.679
oh you're gonna complete you can't do

4492.8 --> 4496.8
that

4493.679 --> 4498.8
you put on whiteface you're shaming the

4496.8 --> 4500.56
white people

4498.8 --> 4502.320000000001
like what the [ __ ]

4500.56 --> 4505.320000000001
the [ __ ] are you blabbering about you

4502.32 --> 4505.32
idiot

4512.8 --> 4517.12
use the

4514.239 --> 4519.199
bird poo for that make

4517.12 --> 4522.599999999999
whatever it takes

4519.199 --> 4522.599999999999
letter sage

4543.84 --> 4548.6
what rest dad are you talking about

4563.92 --> 4567.92
peel skin

4565.52 --> 4569.92
not being conscious yeah it is an urban

4567.92 --> 4572.8
thing it is a oh

4569.92 --> 4574.32
we're better than you you're just dumb

4572.8 --> 4577.2390000000005
laborers

4574.32 --> 4579.44
we're smart we know how to do

4577.239 --> 4581.919999999999
cryptocurrency and

4579.44 --> 4584.4
squirt over virtue signaling all day

4581.92 --> 4586.64
long we're the better ones

4584.4 --> 4586.639999999999
yeah

4587.04 --> 4589.36
i mean

4589.6 --> 4592.719
why are you so pale is it because you're

4591.44 --> 4594.5599999999995
a nobility

4592.719 --> 4596.64
no it's because you

4594.56 --> 4600.2390000000005
are too afraid to come out of your mom's

4596.64 --> 4602.719
basement and squirt over twitter and

4600.239 --> 4605.12
all day long oh okay

4602.719 --> 4605.12
all right

4605.199 --> 4611.199
i'll i'll take

4606.84 --> 4613.360000000001
a little bit darker tanned skin person

4611.199 --> 4614.879999999999
that actually does something productive

4613.36 --> 4616.639999999999
with their life

4614.88 --> 4620.28
rather than

4616.64 --> 4620.280000000001
somebody like that

4633.52 --> 4637.1990000000005
but yeah barges but you're you're

4635.199 --> 4640.32
correct it is a class thing it is in

4637.199 --> 4643.5199999999995
india very distinct

4640.32 --> 4645.12
like what's your skin pale level that

4643.52 --> 4648.84
matters a lot

4645.12 --> 4648.84
for the class stuff

4657.44 --> 4660.32
they're primitive until you find that

4658.88 --> 4661.76
they can enter your dreams and you find

4660.32 --> 4664.4
yourself helpless

4661.76 --> 4666.2390000000005
not really it's just that yeah they do

4664.4 --> 4668.08
have

4666.239 --> 4669.759999999999
they remain natural and so their

4668.08 --> 4672.0
spiritual

4669.76 --> 4675.12
i guess like interdimensional telepathic

4672.0 --> 4677.679
abilities are still intact

4675.12 --> 4678.48
they haven't neglected and wasted them

4677.679 --> 4679.76
all

4678.48 --> 4681.199
yeah

4679.76 --> 4682.64
that's the difference because i

4681.199 --> 4683.599999999999
understand what you're talking about rig

4682.64 --> 4685.76
back

4683.6 --> 4687.52
that's why i'm kind of like stumbling a

4685.76 --> 4690.719
bit and trying to like describe what

4687.52 --> 4692.88
that is because i have actually

4690.719 --> 4696.4800000000005
a lot of respect for like people that

4692.88 --> 4698.0
would seem to live primitive

4696.48 --> 4701.12
because

4698.0 --> 4703.28
they're not just wasting their time

4701.12 --> 4704.5599999999995
you see they do things with their time

4703.28 --> 4706.4
they do

4704.56 --> 4709.92
those types of people do a lot more

4706.4 --> 4709.92
internal reflecting

4710.159 --> 4715.199
than a lot of people in the west that

4713.28 --> 4718.84
don't do a lot of inner reflecting

4715.199 --> 4721.199
instead just go dwelling information

4718.84 --> 4724.32
routes right they don't reflect on

4721.199 --> 4727.919999999999
themselves they let like st information

4724.32 --> 4727.92
wash over them like a flood

4728.32 --> 4731.599999999999
right

4729.199 --> 4734.4
well this primitives that don't have

4731.6 --> 4736.08
mobile phones and internet they don't do

4734.4 --> 4738.799999999999
that they're not

4736.08 --> 4739.76
flooded by information and craziness all

4738.8 --> 4741.360000000001
the time

4739.76 --> 4743.679
so they get to like

4741.36 --> 4746.08
really fine-tune their senses and figure

4743.679 --> 4749.64
out how things really work even in the

4746.08 --> 4749.64
spiritual realm

4764.08 --> 4771.12
that's right right back agreed

4767.04 --> 4771.12
i mean i learned from that

4771.679 --> 4776.4
but partially assimilated into my entire

4775.28 --> 4778.639999999999
existence

4776.4 --> 4781.04
learning from that

4778.64 --> 4784.320000000001
because when i first met

4781.04 --> 4787.12
people like that when i was younger

4784.32 --> 4789.28
i was just immediately jealous

4787.12 --> 4793.12
and like

4789.28 --> 4795.12
damn you actually got stuff that matters

4793.12 --> 4798.08
i want that

4795.12 --> 4798.08
and they'll be like

4798.159 --> 4801.04
yeah

4799.28 --> 4803.599999999999
but you're

4801.04 --> 4805.5199999999995
already integrated in the beast you grew

4803.6 --> 4806.639
up in that like you can't be like that

4805.52 --> 4810.0
and i'm like

4806.639 --> 4813.4400000000005
but i can literally just

4810.0 --> 4815.76
choose to be like that

4813.44 --> 4817.759999999999
and kind of throw society away i'll

4815.76 --> 4820.08
still be in there

4817.76 --> 4824.400000000001
but i'm not going to

4820.08 --> 4827.04
optimize myself to society's standards

4824.4 --> 4828.5599999999995
i'm going to optimize myself to my own

4827.04 --> 4832.84
standards

4828.56 --> 4832.84
and try to follow your example

4834.48 --> 4838.32
i don't know if i actually had a literal

4836.48 --> 4839.678999999999
conversation like that at some point but

4838.32 --> 4843.799999999999
that is

4839.679 --> 4843.8
those are things that have happened

4848.639 --> 4853.6
i have come across some really spiritual

4851.28 --> 4853.599999999999
people

4855.36 --> 4859.599999999999
especially like when i was really young

4857.199 --> 4861.678999999999
and my parents would seek them out it

4859.6 --> 4862.400000000001
was like spiritual discovery journey

4861.679 --> 4864.639
thing

4862.4 --> 4867.12
kind of hippie-ish but still very

4864.639 --> 4867.12
serious

4869.92 --> 4872.92
hmm

4882.56 --> 4888.400000000001
right but it is really about what i just

4885.199 --> 4891.759999999999
laid down kind of on the run

4888.4 --> 4893.759999999999
it's about not adapting to society's

4891.76 --> 4895.92
standards

4893.76 --> 4898.0
but to your own standards

4895.92 --> 4900.159
because the society is going to try to

4898.0 --> 4902.4
pull you out of whack

4900.159 --> 4905.44
so that you lose grip over yourself and

4902.4 --> 4908.0
then instead just try to uphold that

4905.44 --> 4908.0
standard

4908.96 --> 4915.6
i distinctly don't do that it's like oh

4913.28 --> 4917.04
i'm in a situation people are going to

4915.6 --> 4918.4800000000005
tell me oh this and this is going to

4917.04 --> 4919.5199999999995
happen i'm like

4918.48 --> 4921.5199999999995
no

4919.52 --> 4922.4800000000005
and everybody's like all flustered like

4921.52 --> 4923.6
uh

4922.48 --> 4925.919999999999
what

4923.6 --> 4927.6
you're not supposed to say no

4925.92 --> 4929.679
you're supposed to be like yeah yeah

4927.6 --> 4933.280000000001
yeah and i'm like no

4929.679 --> 4936.0
no i don't actually believe that

4933.28 --> 4939.199
i'm bracing against it but i'm not

4936.0 --> 4939.199
afraid i'm just

4939.44 --> 4944.759999999999
i'm not i'm not buying into that

4951.76 --> 4956.2390000000005
the autopilot

4953.6 --> 4959.120000000001
society standard

4956.239 --> 4962.5599999999995
anyway hey dan's dancing field

4959.12 --> 4962.5599999999995
arson lannister

4963.36 --> 4972.199
oh god i think we've got a derp alert

4967.6 --> 4972.1990000000005
yes earth is really flat

4988.88 --> 4992.32
yeah it is

4991.199 --> 4995.44
how

4992.32 --> 4997.759999999999
the horizon's not geometric in

4995.44 --> 5000.638999999999
comport doesn't comport

4997.76 --> 5004.4800000000005
with the spherical geometry claimed by

5000.639 --> 5004.4800000000005
the globe earth model believers

5005.76 --> 5010.320000000001
in black swan we can see too far at low

5008.48 --> 5011.599999999999
observation height

5010.32 --> 5013.759999999999
one foot

5011.6 --> 5015.120000000001
high over the ocean

5013.76 --> 5019.92
seeing

5015.12 --> 5022.4
coastline 11 kilometers or more away

5019.92 --> 5025.04
that's impossible if the earth was a

5022.4 --> 5028.239
sphere because then all that sight would

5025.04 --> 5029.36
have been completely blocked by the

5028.239 --> 5032.0
ocean

5029.36 --> 5034.0
which would be geometrically in between

5032.0 --> 5035.199
the observer

5034.0 --> 5038.08
and

5035.199 --> 5040.239
that beach line 11 miles away because

5038.08 --> 5041.199
the observer height is one

5040.239 --> 5044.4
foot

5041.199 --> 5044.4
above water level

5044.8 --> 5049.92
on a sphere earth it would be

5046.96 --> 5051.44
absolutely impossible no matter the

5049.92 --> 5054.4
conditions

5051.44 --> 5057.12
to be able to see the coastline

5054.4 --> 5058.08
11 miles away when the observation

5057.12 --> 5060.0
height

5058.08 --> 5061.84
is one foot

5060.0 --> 5065.679
that's physically

5061.84 --> 5067.6
geometrically impossible black swan

5065.679 --> 5069.6
the earth is not

5067.6 --> 5072.92
that globe

5069.6 --> 5072.92
it's flat

5089.84 --> 5092.56
yeah it's called the black swan argument

5091.84 --> 5095.1990000000005
it's

5092.56 --> 5096.639
a historical reference

5095.199 --> 5100.4
to a time

5096.639 --> 5103.04
when a club of rich people

5100.4 --> 5104.0
were doing a bet and one person said

5103.04 --> 5106.48
look

5104.0 --> 5108.239
see all these ones they're all white

5106.48 --> 5110.0
that means

5108.239 --> 5113.36
all swans are white

5110.0 --> 5117.199
see because they're all white

5113.36 --> 5118.799999999999
and somebody disagreed with that notion

5117.199 --> 5120.96
because he heard like yeah but there

5118.8 --> 5125.04
might be others it's ones that aren't

5120.96 --> 5127.92
white like way down south

5125.04 --> 5129.28
so the other person who didn't like the

5127.92 --> 5132.32
first person that was kind of an

5129.28 --> 5133.679
arrogant ass saying all swans were white

5132.32 --> 5136.0
he was like oh yeah i'm gonna find a

5133.679 --> 5137.92
black swan so he went around the world

5136.0 --> 5141.679
and guess what yeah there were a whole

5137.92 --> 5144.2390000000005
race of black swans

5141.679 --> 5146.8
so he he took one with him

5144.239 --> 5146.799999999999
probably

5147.04 --> 5151.6
right he and then he presented it to him

5149.52 --> 5152.96
look see dude

5151.6 --> 5155.280000000001
smart ass

5152.96 --> 5157.12
see a black swan

5155.28 --> 5158.0
and there's a whole bunch more of them

5157.12 --> 5161.12
yeah

5158.0 --> 5163.199
not all swans are wise okay

5161.12 --> 5164.96
you're wrong you're incorrect here's a

5163.199 --> 5166.0
black one

5164.96 --> 5166.84
that's

5166.0 --> 5170.719
the

5166.84 --> 5170.719
historical scenario

5170.8 --> 5177.28
that the black swan argument references

5173.36 --> 5177.28
the only modus tollens

5177.44 --> 5180.4
p therefore q

5180.719 --> 5185.44
oh god i'm not good at this part

5183.6 --> 5189.120000000001
somebody in chat filming it but it's

5185.44 --> 5191.04
basically look if there's one exception

5189.12 --> 5194.719
then you're wrong right if there's one

5191.04 --> 5195.92
exception to the globe geometry

5194.719 --> 5197.04
like

5195.92 --> 5200.0
you would

5197.04 --> 5200.0
be able to see

5200.239 --> 5205.36
at one foot observation height something

5203.04 --> 5208.32
that's 11 miles away

5205.36 --> 5211.199
if if that happens just once that means

5208.32 --> 5214.0
it's not that globe modus tollens

5211.199 --> 5215.199
black swan see there's an exception it's

5214.0 --> 5217.6
over

5215.199 --> 5220.159
the idea that the earth was a globe is

5217.6 --> 5221.4400000000005
immediately disproven by that one

5220.159 --> 5223.759999999999
observation

5221.44 --> 5225.678999999999
one foot high

5223.76 --> 5228.639
11 miles away

5225.679 --> 5231.21
it's done the earth is not a globe

5228.639 --> 5234.96
black swan

5231.21 --> 5237.76
[Music]

5234.96 --> 5240.8
dude if if that's not enough for you i

5237.76 --> 5242.639
mean i can't explain anything more about

5240.8 --> 5244.159000000001
if that's not enough for you i'm gonna

5242.639 --> 5247.76
kick you out because that means you're

5244.159 --> 5250.5599999999995
like a 70 iq [ __ ]

5247.76 --> 5253.1990000000005
i mean i literally described it verbatim

5250.56 --> 5255.280000000001
every aspect

5253.199 --> 5258.799999999999
every aspect there is nothing more to

5255.28 --> 5259.759999999999
explain if you don't understand that

5258.8 --> 5265.400000000001
then

5259.76 --> 5265.400000000001
just [ __ ] off to some clown house okay

5272.88 --> 5275.76
yeah he's a troll

5278.639 --> 5281.84
bye bye

5293.12 --> 5299.249
my god it's this nonsense

5296.17 --> 5299.249
[Music]

5299.679 --> 5304.2390000000005
gravity has no effect on water

5302.48 --> 5306.0
what the [ __ ] are you talking about

5304.239 --> 5309.4
what's gravity

5306.0 --> 5309.4
it doesn't exist

5317.52 --> 5323.280000000001
we wouldn't breathe

5319.6 --> 5325.4400000000005
water if hydrogen was being forced down

5323.28 --> 5328.159
we would only breathe what the [ __ ] are

5325.44 --> 5331.36
you talking about dude

5328.159 --> 5334.36
what the hell have you been

5331.36 --> 5334.36
sniffing

5340.159 --> 5344.239
are you like on

5341.92 --> 5348.92
nitrous oxide or something

5344.239 --> 5348.919999999999
the [ __ ] are you blabbering about dude

5353.36 --> 5359.08
did i see next level yes i did smart

5356.08 --> 5359.08
corbeau

5382.0 --> 5387.28
what did i think i reviewed it i i gave

5385.12 --> 5389.679
a review at the start of my show i'm not

5387.28 --> 5391.599999999999
gonna do it again

5389.679 --> 5396.08
if you want to hear my opinions on it

5391.6 --> 5396.08
then just watch the show from the start

5398.96 --> 5402.08
just finished it all right

5405.6 --> 5408.400000000001
i mean

5406.48 --> 5410.32
let me summarize it

5408.4 --> 5413.04
it's fine

5410.32 --> 5416.0
but there are the typical things that

5413.04 --> 5417.84
are just wrong in there

5416.0 --> 5420.8
ether

5417.84 --> 5422.8
sun position reification

5420.8 --> 5424.8
but that's pretty much it i mean it's

5422.8 --> 5427.28
kind of embarrassing

5424.8 --> 5429.360000000001
but still if you don't know about that

5427.28 --> 5431.36
necessarily yeah it's a pretty cool

5429.36 --> 5434.4
movie it's okay it's it's good for

5431.36 --> 5437.44
newcomers fine

5434.4 --> 5440.0
but it's not the end-all be-all it's not

5437.44 --> 5443.638999999999
like the best thing ever

5440.0 --> 5443.639
that's pretty cool

5459.199 --> 5465.36
what the hell

5461.76 --> 5465.360000000001
are you talking about right back

5471.92 --> 5479.4400000000005
talking about a guest on jim bob i think

5474.48 --> 5479.44
i missed his show not sure if i saw it

5480.639 --> 5485.1990000000005
he made next level

5482.639 --> 5485.1990000000005
okay

5485.6 --> 5489.320000000001
was he in it too

5501.76 --> 5508.579000000001
right all right

5505.17 --> 5508.579
[Music]

5512.4 --> 5519.239
ah the guy with the black bear right

5515.12 --> 5519.239
yeah he was in it a lot

5522.56 --> 5525.92
i have no idea who that guy is

5525.199 --> 5528.919999999999
but

5525.92 --> 5528.92
sure

5543.199 --> 5546.4
they

5544.159 --> 5547.44
the trouble with using the black swan

5546.4 --> 5549.5199999999995
logic

5547.44 --> 5551.839999999999
to make a point is that the opposition

5549.52 --> 5553.92
only needs one picture that backs up

5551.84 --> 5556.08
their claim to negate the whole thing no

5553.92 --> 5559.4800000000005
no that's

5556.08 --> 5559.48
that's wrong

5560.32 --> 5565.12
now that's

5562.56 --> 5567.1990000000005
that's incorrect

5565.12 --> 5569.679
it's a one-way street

5567.199 --> 5569.678999999999
they know

5570.08 --> 5574.96
yeah they

5571.76 --> 5577.12
they globe believers can show us

5574.96 --> 5579.84
pictures where it seems oh look the

5577.12 --> 5581.679
thing is behind the horizon now

5579.84 --> 5583.679
that means it's a globe after all yeah

5581.679 --> 5586.4800000000005
that doesn't work that way

5583.679 --> 5590.0
it's a one-way statement

5586.48 --> 5591.839999999999
one exception it's over

5590.0 --> 5593.6
that doesn't mean oh here's here's a

5591.84 --> 5595.679
white swan again right so it means

5593.6 --> 5600.1990000000005
they're all white again no no there was

5595.679 --> 5600.1990000000005
the black swan it's done it's over

5604.56 --> 5609.92
right you showing pictures would that

5606.96 --> 5610.639
suggest that it's going to curved after

5609.92 --> 5612.4800000000005
all

5610.639 --> 5615.36
it doesn't work

5612.48 --> 5617.44
because the exceptions already there

5615.36 --> 5619.599999999999
there are sites that are geometrically

5617.44 --> 5622.5599999999995
impossible if the earth were a globe

5619.6 --> 5625.4400000000005
they exist so it's over

5622.56 --> 5627.76
earth not a globe

5625.44 --> 5631.0
you can show all the apparent curvature

5627.76 --> 5631.0
you like

5631.28 --> 5638.32
it's it doesn't matter anymore

5634.96 --> 5638.32
because there is an exception

5641.92 --> 5647.12
you cancel your rook fin after owen

5644.4 --> 5650.0
all right yeah well keep keep following

5647.12 --> 5653.84
owen he's still talking about it

5650.0 --> 5653.84
i mean it's not entirely over yet

5654.719 --> 5659.04
but yeah i'm not gonna sign on to

5656.8 --> 5661.04
rockpin

5659.04 --> 5662.88
i didn't really plan to i never liked

5661.04 --> 5667.12
the feel of it you see

5662.88 --> 5667.12
and that's just like an armenian feel

5667.36 --> 5670.96
it's like yeah rock from this rock from

5669.04 --> 5673.199
that and i'm like

5670.96 --> 5674.32
i don't like the way people

5673.199 --> 5676.159
praise it

5674.32 --> 5678.4
it's just there's something weird in the

5676.159 --> 5679.759999999999
tone of how they talk about it and it

5678.4 --> 5682.719
just like

5679.76 --> 5682.719
i just don't like it

5683.119 --> 5689.599999999999
i just don't like it

5686.96 --> 5691.84
and yeah the whole rockfin situation

5689.6 --> 5694.400000000001
with owen benjamin and

5691.84 --> 5694.400000000001
martin

5696.08 --> 5700.159
from rockfin and all that it's it was

5698.08 --> 5702.159
hilarious by the way it is very

5700.159 --> 5704.0
hilarious to

5702.159 --> 5706.879999999999
listen to everything he has to say about

5704.0 --> 5706.88
that situation

5707.44 --> 5713.28
but that certainly like pinned down that

5710.719 --> 5715.679
weird feeling that i had like i don't

5713.28 --> 5718.719
want to engage with this and now i kind

5715.679 --> 5720.639
of have some empirical feedback as to

5718.719 --> 5723.04
why

5720.639 --> 5726.56
it's like oh so that's why i

5723.04 --> 5728.96
don't really want to get in there

5726.56 --> 5730.320000000001
because if they're gonna nag owen about

5728.96 --> 5731.92
that

5730.32 --> 5733.5199999999995
then there's a chance that they're gonna

5731.92 --> 5736.2390000000005
nag me

5733.52 --> 5737.080000000001
right because i have

5736.239 --> 5740.799999999999
like

5737.08 --> 5743.8
counter-narrative views

5740.8 --> 5743.8
right

5747.44 --> 5752.239
i mean that's

5748.96 --> 5757.2390000000005
kind of established now

5752.239 --> 5757.239
i take it i hope that you paid attention

5758.4 --> 5761.04
so yeah

5761.52 --> 5767.76
i'm still surprised that i'm just here

5763.92 --> 5772.4800000000005
on youtube and it's just old whatever

5767.76 --> 5772.4800000000005
i'm free i can do whatever i want

5774.32 --> 5779.84
don't seem to get strikes for it

5777.76 --> 5781.76
right there's people literally in chat

5779.84 --> 5784.0
sometimes like oh don't talk about this

5781.76 --> 5786.159000000001
you'll get kicked off and i literally

5784.0 --> 5788.0
say it like with glee

5786.159 --> 5789.759999999999
and like

5788.0 --> 5792.08
i'm literally just saying it i'm

5789.76 --> 5794.0
literally saying it right now

5792.08 --> 5795.84
and i'm not gonna get a strike for it

5794.0 --> 5797.119
and there's nothing you can do about it

5795.84 --> 5799.4400000000005
guess what

5797.119 --> 5801.36
yeah i didn't get a strike for it every

5799.44 --> 5802.239
time i done that now

5801.36 --> 5804.799999999999
so

5802.239 --> 5808.718999999999
whatever's going on

5804.8 --> 5808.719
like i don't have to worry

5809.52 --> 5813.92
i don't know if i'll get the same

5812.8 --> 5816.400000000001
deal

5813.92 --> 5819.36
however it was established when i go on

5816.4 --> 5819.36
another platform

5820.159 --> 5824.0
who's to say they're going to give me

5821.76 --> 5825.84
that same type of space

5824.0 --> 5828.639
maybe martin's going to give me calls

5825.84 --> 5832.719
and like er in the way you talked about

5828.639 --> 5834.639
like oh you want people to go aggressive

5832.719 --> 5836.8
and like violently overthrow the

5834.639 --> 5839.679
government and like oh we can't tolerate

5836.8 --> 5842.719
that and i'm like um

5839.679 --> 5842.719
see what happens

5842.96 --> 5846.32
yeah

5844.48 --> 5848.638999999999
i mean

5846.32 --> 5850.96
if he's gonna complain about owen

5848.639 --> 5853.4400000000005
benjamin making a joke about shaq eating

5850.96 --> 5855.6
a banana

5853.44 --> 5857.44
i mean come on

5855.6 --> 5859.360000000001
if that's a problem then he's gonna have

5857.44 --> 5861.5199999999995
a problem with me

5859.36 --> 5864.32
talking the way that i do expressing

5861.52 --> 5866.56
like the inevitable

5864.32 --> 5869.119
rage that will well up

5866.56 --> 5871.76
and make people like lay down

5869.119 --> 5873.759999999999
their refined senses for civilization

5871.76 --> 5876.88
and spring into

5873.76 --> 5880.08
intuitive action to do what's necessary

5876.88 --> 5883.6
and get it over with no matter the cost

5880.08 --> 5888.08
right i bet martin wouldn't like that if

5883.6 --> 5888.08
i talked like that on rockfin

5890.03 --> 5896.32
[Music]

5893.04 --> 5898.48
and i bet a whole bunch of other guys

5896.32 --> 5901.44
in the flat earth

5898.48 --> 5903.839999999999
don't like it that i do that either

5901.44 --> 5906.32
right you don't like it you don't talk

5903.84 --> 5907.76
to me about it you don't say hey arwen

5906.32 --> 5911.84
you know

5907.76 --> 5911.84
we don't really like this part

5912.639 --> 5917.76
i don't get feedback i don't know i

5915.36 --> 5920.239
don't know what the what they think

5917.76 --> 5920.2390000000005
about it

5920.32 --> 5926.32
i have very little feedback

5923.28 --> 5928.4
from other people as to what they think

5926.32 --> 5929.28
about what i do

5928.4 --> 5930.5599999999995
very

5929.28 --> 5932.48
very

5930.56 --> 5935.119000000001
little feedback

5932.48 --> 5937.839999999999
yeah i get more feedback

5935.119 --> 5939.839999999999
from trolls than i do from fellow flat

5937.84 --> 5941.6
earthers about my ideas

5939.84 --> 5944.0
that's why i kind of have to force

5941.6 --> 5946.719
myself into and just put it down like

5944.0 --> 5948.32
little on the spot painting like hello

5946.719 --> 5949.679
this is the only way i can get you to

5948.32 --> 5953.28
look hello

5949.679 --> 5956.719
yeah i have to be a conspiracy theorist

5953.28 --> 5959.04
within a conspiracy theory community

5956.719 --> 5961.36
i have to be that guy again

5959.04 --> 5963.76
because people just

5961.36 --> 5963.759999999999
they're not

5964.8 --> 5969.28
they don't

5966.48 --> 5971.599999999999
they're not connecting

5969.28 --> 5972.96
i mean you guys in chat are connecting

5971.6 --> 5976.719
right because you're a part of my

5972.96 --> 5976.719
workshop you're part of the chats

5977.52 --> 5980.88
but like other

5978.96 --> 5982.56
creators

5980.88 --> 5985.6
i'm not getting

5982.56 --> 5985.6
direct feedback

5986.08 --> 5992.84
i get some feedback from nathan i get

5989.119 --> 5994.719
some feedback from the guys on the panel

5992.84 --> 5998.4800000000005
sometimes

5994.719 --> 6001.92
and not all that great a feedback even

5998.48 --> 6001.919999999999
as in effective

6002.32 --> 6007.199
i mean you guys give me more effective

6004.4 --> 6009.119
feedback than

6007.199 --> 6012.799999999999
than any of the flat earthers that are

6009.119 --> 6014.96
having their own channels on average

6012.8 --> 6018.0
because i don't know what they think

6014.96 --> 6020.719
about me i don't know

6018.0 --> 6022.719
do they think i'm secretly an infiltrate

6020.719 --> 6024.719
ready to take over

6022.719 --> 6026.719
and ruin it all

6024.719 --> 6028.56
do they think that well if they do

6026.719 --> 6030.4
they're not telling me

6028.56 --> 6032.88
they're not sharing their worries or

6030.4 --> 6036.159
anything they're not telling me anything

6032.88 --> 6038.4800000000005
seriously they don't talk to me

6036.159 --> 6040.799999999999
i literally have to do everything on my

6038.48 --> 6042.5599999999995
own divination

6040.8 --> 6044.719
i have to guess what they're thinking

6042.56 --> 6050.52
and i'm doing my best to get it right

6044.719 --> 6050.52
because they're not giving me feedback

6072.08 --> 6076.08
oh [ __ ] classical homeopath

6074.719 --> 6078.0
you're triggered when i call for

6076.08 --> 6081.119
violence

6078.0 --> 6084.56
can you can you elaborate how exactly

6081.119 --> 6087.5599999999995
you're triggered what causes the anxiety

6084.56 --> 6087.56
specifically

6095.04 --> 6099.199
oh god i think we got a derp alert

6100.239 --> 6106.44
i think it's

6102.4 --> 6106.44
another sean sock

6106.88 --> 6112.56
what do eclipses happen if the earth

6108.96 --> 6112.56
isn't a boy between the sun

6117.199 --> 6121.719
oh

6118.0 --> 6121.719
it never ends

6134.08 --> 6141.84
it is the values of our democracy to

6137.36 --> 6141.839999999999
remain non-violent it's who we are

6145.6 --> 6149.360000000001
okay

6146.8 --> 6151.4400000000005
that's cool and in general a classical

6149.36 --> 6153.759999999999
homeopath i'd agree with you if it were

6151.44 --> 6157.28
not that

6153.76 --> 6158.08
if i have to choose in being non-violent

6157.28 --> 6161.04
but

6158.08 --> 6162.4
as i am non-violent and i adapt

6161.04 --> 6165.92
perfectly

6162.4 --> 6169.04
i see everything that i love

6165.92 --> 6170.4800000000005
slowly disappearing degenerating

6169.04 --> 6172.239
people's souls

6170.48 --> 6175.759999999999
slowly seeping away becoming

6172.239 --> 6178.4
unrecognizable unnatural no longer fed

6175.76 --> 6179.84
by the spirit of god if i see that

6178.4 --> 6181.679
slowly happening around me and

6179.84 --> 6183.1990000000005
effectively see the entire world getting

6181.679 --> 6184.08
tortured

6183.199 --> 6187.36
to

6184.08 --> 6189.76
vacancy and death

6187.36 --> 6192.32
well

6189.76 --> 6196.08
i don't really like that non-violence

6192.32 --> 6198.719
thing anymore then yeah cause

6196.08 --> 6200.8
i don't want to feel responsible for

6198.719 --> 6204.08
letting all that [ __ ] happen just

6200.8 --> 6206.96
because i have to be non-violent

6204.08 --> 6208.88
sounds like a contract in hell

6206.96 --> 6211.199
to me

6208.88 --> 6211.1990000000005
yeah

6211.28 --> 6213.5199999999995
so

6215.04 --> 6220.08
i vote to end

6217.36 --> 6220.08
the malice

6220.32 --> 6226.4
yeah if we're gonna be democratic about

6222.239 --> 6230.0
it well then i i choose the other way

6226.4 --> 6230.0
i vote to end the malice

6230.32 --> 6235.44
i vote to put a stop to the people that

6234.0 --> 6238.08
are

6235.44 --> 6240.0
noticeably overtly

6238.08 --> 6241.6
demonic and out of control and

6240.0 --> 6243.52
unrepentant

6241.6 --> 6246.400000000001
about it

6243.52 --> 6249.92
i vote that they be

6246.4 --> 6249.92
basically criminalized

6253.52 --> 6257.92
effectively

6255.6 --> 6257.92
right

6259.199 --> 6263.5199999999995
that that doesn't make any sense by the

6260.96 --> 6265.92
way no i retract that criminalized no

6263.52 --> 6265.92
it's just

6267.92 --> 6272.0
maybe sub-societal right

6270.32 --> 6273.92
i really think that just the only thing

6272.0 --> 6275.84
that's really work is that just people

6273.92 --> 6277.36
just show them like

6275.84 --> 6280.8
this it's over

6277.36 --> 6282.159
you're we will not allow you to do that

6280.8 --> 6286.08
anymore

6282.159 --> 6288.879999999999
and [ __ ] the [ __ ] loss that you hide

6286.08 --> 6290.96
under we're not going to allow you to do

6288.88 --> 6293.1990000000005
it anymore now

6290.96 --> 6293.199
yeah

6293.28 --> 6299.96
you will not have your demonic freedom

6296.96 --> 6299.96
anymore

6302.719 --> 6305.76
yeah

6304.0 --> 6307.679
so yeah you could

6305.76 --> 6310.159000000001
convince yourself in all kinds of way

6307.679 --> 6311.28
that you have the right to do that

6310.159 --> 6312.799999999999
but

6311.28 --> 6313.679
yeah

6312.8 --> 6315.76
we

6313.679 --> 6318.0
the rest of the people

6315.76 --> 6320.159000000001
will grow more and more impatient and

6318.0 --> 6323.44
those that still hold on

6320.159 --> 6324.5599999999995
to what is right will eventually come to

6323.44 --> 6328.159
the point

6324.56 --> 6330.2390000000005
where we will decide to not let you do

6328.159 --> 6331.199
that anymore

6330.239 --> 6334.08
yeah

6331.199 --> 6335.599999999999
pretty much no matter the pretense or

6334.08 --> 6338.48
cost

6335.6 --> 6341.1990000000005
it's just going to be over

6338.48 --> 6345.08
and that is part of the essence

6341.199 --> 6345.08
that i try to express

6345.679 --> 6352.2390000000005
you don't have unlimited demonic freedom

6349.84 --> 6355.679
there is a counterbalance

6352.239 --> 6357.199
counterbalance is the vengeance

6355.679 --> 6360.719
of god

6357.199 --> 6360.719
through other people

6363.679 --> 6367.36
yeah

6364.96 --> 6369.28
and even theoretically it's not going to

6367.36 --> 6371.5199999999995
happen but even theoretically if you

6369.28 --> 6373.759999999999
could route that out of everybody and

6371.52 --> 6377.52
everything guess what's gonna happen

6373.76 --> 6379.119000000001
that vengeance of god through the people

6377.52 --> 6382.0
will arrive

6379.119 --> 6385.36
through some of you

6382.0 --> 6387.52
it's gonna come it's going to end you

6385.36 --> 6390.08
and there's nothing

6387.52 --> 6392.080000000001
nothing in creation

6390.08 --> 6395.04
in the physical world or in the

6392.08 --> 6398.239
spiritual realm that can stop that

6395.04 --> 6401.199
inevitable thing from happening

6398.239 --> 6402.5599999999995
you understand there's nothing you can

6401.199 --> 6405.04
do

6402.56 --> 6406.96
nothing you can do to stop that

6405.04 --> 6411.04
no matter how much you destroy and

6406.96 --> 6414.0
derange and distract it will happen and

6411.04 --> 6415.44
if you're the only person left in the

6414.0 --> 6419.36
world

6415.44 --> 6422.4
then that spirit will come through you

6419.36 --> 6426.5599999999995
and you will end yourself

6422.4 --> 6429.36
because there is nothing in creation

6426.56 --> 6431.76
that can stop that from happening

6429.36 --> 6432.96
and i'd like to remind everybody about

6431.76 --> 6434.96
that

6432.96 --> 6438.32
especially those people that think you

6434.96 --> 6440.0
have unlimited domain demonic freedom

6438.32 --> 6442.4
you don't

6440.0 --> 6443.84
and there's nothing you can do

6442.4 --> 6448.28
to stop

6443.84 --> 6448.28
that end from coming

6451.77 --> 6455.069
[Music]

6464.159 --> 6467.36
man our time has flown

6468.88 --> 6471.84
nobody's listening

6474.4 --> 6480.48
maybe classical homeopath is

6477.04 --> 6480.48
crying in a corner again

6480.88 --> 6486.2390000000005
i yeah i know you were being sarcastic

6483.04 --> 6486.239
but i'm playing into it

6491.6 --> 6496.2390000000005
it's almost i'm almost hoping that a

6493.92 --> 6499.52
squirt boy is gonna pop up and actually

6496.239 --> 6501.759999999999
try to resist that for real

6499.52 --> 6504.96
but

6501.76 --> 6504.96
it's not going to happen

6508.32 --> 6513.84
no no no let's go home but it's fine

6510.56 --> 6513.84
don't worry about it hey

6514.32 --> 6516.88
lsg

6519.6 --> 6523.96
you just sent me a video

6525.29 --> 6531.319
[Music]

6538.84 --> 6545.04
uh oh okay he's sending me a whole bunch

6542.239 --> 6545.04
of videos now

6545.28 --> 6549.599999999999
through skype but yeah i'm gonna stick

6546.96 --> 6549.6
to the show

6552.08 --> 6559.28
no i learned and then so it was a huge

6554.56 --> 6559.280000000001
scam no flat earth is a scam

6559.36 --> 6564.96
it's a scam it's such a scam that we

6562.0 --> 6566.96
constantly tell you exactly with

6564.96 --> 6569.119
academic detail

6566.96 --> 6571.44
how the earth is in the globe and can't

6569.119 --> 6573.92
be a globe and how all the trains of

6571.44 --> 6575.598999999999
thinking that lead to you

6573.92 --> 6578.08
being convinced that the earth is a

6575.599 --> 6580.88
globe are all false

6578.08 --> 6582.8
to a fine detail yeah that's a scam all

6580.88 --> 6585.04
right

6582.8 --> 6587.92
oh we're such a scam we're a scam

6585.04 --> 6588.8
pointing out exactly with fine detail

6587.92 --> 6589.84
and

6588.8 --> 6592.2390000000005
huge

6589.84 --> 6595.4400000000005
amounts of feedback

6592.239 --> 6597.04
based on empirical evidence and academic

6595.44 --> 6599.44
research and

6597.04 --> 6601.92
insight and logic itself yeah that's a

6599.44 --> 6604.638999999999
scam that we do that pointing out how

6601.92 --> 6606.719
the earth is not a globe i'm sure it is

6604.639 --> 6608.8
i mean

6606.719 --> 6611.84
maybe

6608.8 --> 6611.84
you're a scammer

6612.08 --> 6617.5199999999995
and you don't like how we're breaking

6615.28 --> 6623.199
this spell

6617.52 --> 6624.8
that you so gladly use for your scamming

6623.199 --> 6628.839999999999
shane vendrel

6624.8 --> 6628.84
have you ever thought about that

6650.719 --> 6655.76
basic observation what basic observation

6653.52 --> 6657.84
of lights in the sky having specific

6655.76 --> 6659.4400000000005
angular relations that change over

6657.84 --> 6663.4400000000005
distance

6659.44 --> 6665.44
oh no no i just explained it it's stars

6663.44 --> 6668.5599999999995
they have angles yeah

6665.44 --> 6672.638999999999
what they don't have however is a

6668.56 --> 6675.4400000000005
spherical earth underneath

6672.639 --> 6678.84
that directly correlate

6675.44 --> 6681.36
in lockstep with this apparent

6678.84 --> 6682.96
demisphere of stars

6681.36 --> 6686.08
that seem

6682.96 --> 6688.4
visible around us yeah

6686.08 --> 6690.96
yeah there's addressing of your basic

6688.4 --> 6690.96
arguments

6692.84 --> 6698.32
oh why aren't flights from south africa

6696.159 --> 6700.96
to australia the longest flights well

6698.32 --> 6704.32
why would they be

6700.96 --> 6704.32
i don't think the earth is a disc

6705.84 --> 6710.96
it's just another map projection

6708.719 --> 6713.52
i think the most accurate

6710.96 --> 6715.76
to date representation of the terrain

6713.52 --> 6718.320000000001
would be a rectangular map

6715.76 --> 6721.76
it is the map that is widely used for

6718.32 --> 6723.759999999999
like the basis of all things relating

6721.76 --> 6726.159000000001
to mapping

6723.76 --> 6727.119000000001
and like technology and radio and

6726.159 --> 6730.159
everything

6727.119 --> 6733.199
they use a rectangular map

6730.159 --> 6733.199
so why would

6733.599 --> 6737.84
the flights from south america to

6735.92 --> 6740.159
australia be longer

6737.84 --> 6741.52
i don't see the necessity of that that's

6740.159 --> 6743.759999999999
only

6741.52 --> 6746.0
people that insist

6743.76 --> 6748.400000000001
that the map is the terrain when they

6746.0 --> 6749.44
look at the disk

6748.4 --> 6753.119
map

6749.44 --> 6753.119
i'm not one of those people

6761.28 --> 6766.0
no mark stout george is not a bot maybe

6764.239 --> 6769.799999999999
he just doesn't give a [ __ ] about what

6766.0 --> 6769.8
you're talking about

6781.84 --> 6785.28
what

6782.8 --> 6790.360000000001
that's that's just a lie

6785.28 --> 6790.36
colin dude get the [ __ ] out of here

6793.36 --> 6798.719
you're gonna start out

6795.44 --> 6800.5599999999995
if the first thing you say upon entry is

6798.719 --> 6802.8
a straight out lie

6800.56 --> 6803.76
that just means you're immediately

6802.8 --> 6805.92
banned

6803.76 --> 6808.2390000000005
if that's how you start that means

6805.92 --> 6812.96
instant ban instant if you're going to

6808.239 --> 6812.959999999999
start out with a blatant overt lie

6813.119 --> 6816.799999999999
banned i don't care who you are what you

6815.36 --> 6818.48
believe in

6816.8 --> 6821.4800000000005
start out with the straight line you're

6818.48 --> 6821.48
banned

6821.92 --> 6825.84
now if you have questions about

6823.76 --> 6827.84
something that's something else if you

6825.84 --> 6832.76
start out with a straight out lie you're

6827.84 --> 6832.76
bad i don't care what you believe in

6838.159 --> 6843.839999999999
you literally see birds disappearing

6840.96 --> 6846.88
bottom up over the horizon

6843.84 --> 6849.119000000001
now they disappear into the horizon

6846.88 --> 6851.28
and the diffraction limit causes you not

6849.119 --> 6854.159
to be able to see

6851.28 --> 6855.36
the bottom part of it yeah and the

6854.159 --> 6857.119
amount

6855.36 --> 6859.5199999999995
that the bottom part is getting

6857.119 --> 6862.4
obstructed over a distance

6859.52 --> 6864.159000000001
is a linear rate

6862.4 --> 6866.638999999999
not

6864.159 --> 6870.48
an exponential rate which would be

6866.639 --> 6872.2390000000005
required on a globe geometry yeah no no

6870.48 --> 6874.718999999999
instead

6872.239 --> 6877.598999999999
things disappear

6874.719 --> 6878.96
behind things

6877.599 --> 6880.400000000001
the bottom

6878.96 --> 6882.08
yeah

6880.4 --> 6883.679
the amount

6882.08 --> 6885.48
that is hidden

6883.679 --> 6887.28
increases at a

6885.48 --> 6888.239
linear

6887.28 --> 6890.639
rate

6888.239 --> 6892.5599999999995
over distance

6890.639 --> 6893.76
linear rate

6892.56 --> 6895.76
not

6893.76 --> 6898.4800000000005
an exponential rate

6895.76 --> 6900.96
which means it's flat

6898.48 --> 6904.239
so however this horizon

6900.96 --> 6906.08
seems to obstruct things it does so at a

6904.239 --> 6908.638999999999
linear rate

6906.08 --> 6911.92
not an exponential rate which it would

6908.639 --> 6914.0
be a dead-on necessity

6911.92 --> 6916.08
if it was being obstructed by globe

6914.0 --> 6918.27
geometry

6916.08 --> 6920.159
and it isn't

6918.27 --> 6923.84
[Music]

6920.159 --> 6926.5599999999995
