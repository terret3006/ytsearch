46.079 --> 51.28
good morning welcome to Flat Earth early

49.48 --> 54.64
bird number

51.28 --> 56.399
1933 I'm your host Arwin and before I

54.64 --> 59.399
start the show please don't forget to

[Music]

92.04 --> 97.04
mostly clear sky a couple of clouds very

97.159 --> 103.68
sunny little bit of wind but I mean the

100.56 --> 106.33
air is overall pretty

103.68 --> 110.71900000000001
warm check the temperature just

106.33 --> 113.36
[Music]

110.719 --> 117.03999999999999
yet the weather seems to be very

113.36 --> 117.04
beautiful this Monday

125.479 --> 130.64
look at how blue that sky is in between

128.8 --> 134.0
the

130.64 --> 134.0
clouds what a

135.52 --> 138.58
[Music]

you right so yeah I got my Tomic coffee

204.64 --> 211.76
already here

207.04 --> 211.76
and Illuminati C

215.64 --> 220.27999999999997
today's going to be a bit of a short

217.12 --> 220.28
show because I got an

220.64 --> 224.27999999999997
appointment half past

227.28 --> 235.239
4 a short show it's like only two plus

232.76 --> 239.959
hours I still remember the time when my

235.239 --> 242.239
shows were like oo two hours that's long

239.959 --> 244.48
but I mean typical shows now we like

242.239 --> 247.36
three hours

244.48 --> 250.23899999999998
so

247.36 --> 253.84
right uh

250.239 --> 253.84
pretty good night

258.769 --> 262.609
[Music]

263.68 --> 271.44
rest time open Nas SpaceX propaganda huh

271.52 --> 275.639
yeah well there they're cranking it out

273.479 --> 275.639
a

279.88 --> 288.36
lot so yeah I mean um

284.84 --> 292.11999999999995
X there's a lot of it Elon Musk is

288.36 --> 297.6
continually like posting that kind of

292.12 --> 297.6
stuff don't see a lot of NASA though

306.12 --> 308.759
right so yeah

308.88 --> 315.08
yesterday know the early bir show was

311.32 --> 315.08
kind of Rowdy and

318.319 --> 321.759
uh a lot of

321.88 --> 326.4
hassle uh the Knight owl show that I had

324.84 --> 327.44
with blue pill Evolution thought that

326.4 --> 330.96
was

327.44 --> 334.479
great very enervating

330.96 --> 337.44
good to have somebody on with me to talk

334.479 --> 339.15999999999997
to and uh yeah hope you all enjoyed that

337.44 --> 342.12
I certainly

339.16 --> 343.72
did and yeah I might him have him on

342.12 --> 346.16
more

343.72 --> 349.47900000000004
often he said that he

346.16 --> 353.199
would so yeah looking forward to to

349.479 --> 353.199
Future cooperations

354.32 --> 369.26
[Music]

372.72 --> 378.59900000000005
it's hilarious spiders on

375.96 --> 380.23999999999995
what what are you talking about clear

378.599 --> 381.97999999999996
spiders on

380.24 --> 384.24
Mars

381.98 --> 388.03900000000004
[Music]

384.24 --> 392.12
what like living

388.039 --> 392.12
spiders I don't know what you're talking

392.24 --> 395.56
[Music]

393.479 --> 398.75899999999996
about sounds

395.56 --> 400.92
silly what I mean it's NASA so they say

398.759 --> 403.97
a lot of silly things

400.92 --> 403.97
[Music]

419.919 --> 426.84
space.com okay hey Bill night science

422.96 --> 426.84
Den good to see you

427.82 --> 434.049
[Music]

436.5 --> 455.599
[Music]

452.24 --> 460.199
oh okay features it's not actual SPID

455.599 --> 460.199
yeah they just call it spiders so

464.92 --> 485.369
[Music]

487.039 --> 493.759
right

489.639 --> 496.52
supposedly dioxide ice bubbling

493.759 --> 499.44
up forming those crystals that's what

496.52 --> 499.44
they're saying

501.8 --> 506.879
okay yeah that's that's kind of silly

510.0 --> 515.64
all right but I mean yeah

512.8 --> 518.7189999999999
that doesn't really matter what it's

515.64 --> 523.519
supposed to be it's just

518.719 --> 523.519
another Mars being a physical Place

523.56 --> 527.2399999999999
presupposing propaganda

528.32 --> 534.44
piece that's what they do like it's not

531.16 --> 536.92
about like oh what is there it's about

534.44 --> 539.72
oh look there's something there because

536.92 --> 541.519
of all this physical stuff

539.72 --> 547.1600000000001
and that's what they

541.519 --> 547.16
do silly space upu right anyway

548.84 --> 553.539
[Music]

556.54 --> 565.56
[Music]

562.44 --> 568.0
cheers man I ran there's some really

565.56 --> 572.079
interesting Twitter posts

568.0 --> 575.8
sometimes I ran into one that's about

572.079 --> 578.88
Einstein and like the extent of how much

575.8 --> 581.3199999999999
of a fraud he really was so I wanted to

578.88 --> 581.32
share

581.399 --> 587.88
that short

584.519 --> 590.9590000000001
video but holy [ __ ] I mean we already

587.88 --> 595.68
knew through Flat Earth debate research

590.959 --> 600.3599999999999
like that wasn't good anyway but man he

595.68 --> 603.1999999999999
literally just stole everything all

600.36 --> 605.36
ideas like and they name the sources

603.2 --> 610.399
from who he stole

605.36 --> 612.839
it it is all encompassing the guy was a

610.399 --> 615.2
total

612.839 --> 618.12
fraud total

615.2 --> 622.24
fraud You could argue that he's never

618.12 --> 622.24
actually had one of his own ideas

622.36 --> 627.9590000000001
ever after you watch this

625.48 --> 629.16
video right so yeah do check that out

627.959 --> 633.17
you could probably check it out right

629.16 --> 636.24
now now it's very short like a couple of

633.17 --> 636.24
[Music]

636.639 --> 642.66
minutes but uh yeah bump into some

639.48 --> 648.12
interesting posts sometimes on Twitter

642.66 --> 648.12
[Music]

653.74 --> 664.399
[Music]

662.04 --> 668.36
right also yeah the sun is coming back

664.399 --> 669.76
and uh of course that's our cue to not

668.36 --> 673.639
wear

669.76 --> 673.639
sunscreen cuz it's

677.399 --> 683.2
bad just I'd recommend just use fresh

681.76 --> 684.8
aloe

683.2 --> 689.36
vera

684.8 --> 691.12
leaf like the the gel from that and

689.36 --> 693.24
it'll probably work a lot

691.12 --> 695.48
better of course they don't like go

693.24 --> 697.8
cooking in the sun especially if you

695.48 --> 700.8000000000001
have sensitive skin but like wearing

697.8 --> 700.8
sunscreen

701.32 --> 706.839
bad that's what Bon clerks do steal

704.279 --> 710.48
everyone else's

706.839 --> 712.72
ideas I guess so but I mean he like all

710.48 --> 715.6
of his presentations he

712.72 --> 718.0400000000001
just took ideas from other people like

715.6 --> 720.16
ideas that have been already manifested

718.04 --> 723.28
for decades you

720.16 --> 726.3399999999999
even it's quite astounding

723.28 --> 726.3399999999999
[Music]

736.71 --> 742.13
[Music]

758.639 --> 764.6800000000001
yeah I've been checking out space audits

762.36 --> 767.6800000000001
a channel I don't know who recommended

764.68 --> 770.399
that recommended to me like probably in

767.68 --> 774.6389999999999
relation to Ether

770.399 --> 779.44
talk but I mean it is they're mostly

774.639 --> 779.44
just reading old papers

779.48 --> 784.0790000000001
it's not of much of a discussion there

785.92 --> 790.519
really so I'm already getting bored with

791.25 --> 796.839
[Music]

793.399 --> 801.399
it but I mean like there's been a lot of

796.839 --> 803.9590000000001
writings about ether and

801.399 --> 805.92
like and they apparently that's what

803.959 --> 811.1199999999999
they do on that channel is just read

805.92 --> 811.12
from the writings about it

814.519 --> 821.92
science is like magic photons are

818.04 --> 821.92
created to transport light

823.04 --> 829.639
what transport light no the photons are

826.32 --> 834.519
the quanta of

829.639 --> 834.519
light it's a weird way of saying it

835.079 --> 840.2099999999999
clearly photons don't transport light

838.0 --> 842.36
they are the light

840.21 --> 845.8000000000001
[Music]

842.36 --> 847.399
a Quant of them it's kind of left open

845.8 --> 850.399
as to

847.399 --> 850.399
like

850.49 --> 856.5600000000001
[Music]

852.88 --> 859.24
how right the problem fundamentally with

856.56 --> 862.4799999999999
light is that it's always

859.24 --> 866.5600000000001
just presupposed it has a

862.48 --> 870.1990000000001
speed even though it's officially not

866.56 --> 872.56
measured except by

870.199 --> 874.8
Celestial distances which are also

872.56 --> 878.3599999999999
presupposed to be at a

874.8 --> 882.079
distance and that's sort of how

878.36 --> 886.6800000000001
they claim to measure the speed of

882.079 --> 888.4799999999999
light but yeah Ryan's logic has done

886.68 --> 890.4399999999999
like couple of presentations on that

888.48 --> 892.9590000000001
that are on his channel and explains

890.44 --> 896.0400000000001
exactly like that it isn't measured it's

892.959 --> 896.8389999999999
not really measured so one way speed the

896.04 --> 900.8389999999999
light

896.839 --> 900.839
measured and

904.0 --> 909.0
yeah remains inconclusive as far as I'm

907.12 --> 911.0
concerned light

909.0 --> 914.839
is

911.0 --> 918.6
instantaneous and things may react to

914.839 --> 921.8800000000001
light in a non- instantaneous fashion

918.6 --> 923.44
because while matter reacting to light

921.88 --> 928.639
which it

923.44 --> 928.639
does may have a slight delay

928.75 --> 933.759
[Music]

930.0 --> 936.959
but the light itself seems to be just

933.759 --> 940.519
instantaneous or so fast you could you

936.959 --> 942.959
can't measure it well if it's so fast

940.519 --> 947.72
you can't measure it then I don't see

942.959 --> 947.7199999999999
why you would conclude that it isn't

950.839 --> 955.519
instantaneous can't measure oh yeah I

952.959 --> 957.199
might have had that reversed two way

955.519 --> 959.8
speed of light one way speed of light I

957.199 --> 963.16
mix them up the point is is that I don't

959.8 --> 966.16
think that light has a speed at

963.16 --> 966.16
all

969.84 --> 977.6600000000001
[Music]

977.839 --> 982.9590000000001
BDubs right so everybody here don't

981.04 --> 985.959
forget to share the show and Rogan's it

982.959 --> 985.959
up

987.22 --> 992.129
[Music]

992.519 --> 995.36
what if you measure the oneway speed

994.199 --> 1001.92
like

995.36 --> 1001.92
twice yeah it's not there's no point to

1005.36 --> 1008.419
[Music]

1017.68 --> 1024.12
that right so going to take a bite out

1020.48 --> 1024.1200000000001
of this cheers

1028.27 --> 1032.1299999999999
[Music]

1061.36 --> 1064.6399999999999
please come up with an

1065.41 --> 1068.479
[Music]

1069.559 --> 1075.6
experiment science would love it would

1072.72 --> 1078.48
it I didn't know

1075.6 --> 1081.1589999999999
science could experience feelings I

1078.48 --> 1081.159
thought it was a

1089.159 --> 1097.0
method right but I don't think that

1092.679 --> 1100.0590000000002
there is a way to measure

1097.0 --> 1100.059
[Music]

1101.6 --> 1107.559
it right I mean there's no way to

1104.919 --> 1109.679
measure it at all the only thing that

1107.559 --> 1112.559
they suggest is a measurement of the

1109.679 --> 1114.039
speed of light is towards a Celestial

1112.559 --> 1117.039
body and

1114.039 --> 1120.32
back and there is no evidence that a

1117.039 --> 1123.52
Celestial body has any distance at all

1120.32 --> 1123.52
any actual distance

1124.2 --> 1132.039
so the result of the claim of a speed

1129.159 --> 1133.44
derived is based on a presupposition of

1132.039 --> 1137.8799999999999
a

1133.44 --> 1137.88
distance so it's a

1141.039 --> 1146.28
presupposed self-fulfilling prophecy

1167.72 --> 1171.679
result for

1188.69 --> 1195.719
[Music]

1199.44 --> 1205.4
oh look Albert Einstein's explanation in

1202.32 --> 1206.06
the photoelectric effect yeah he stole

1205.4 --> 1209.1190000000001
that

1206.06 --> 1209.119
[Music]

1209.6 --> 1215.3999999999999
too it wasn't Albert

1212.559 --> 1218.08
Einstein's invention at all the photo

1215.4 --> 1219.919
electric effect he saw that as well it's

1218.08 --> 1223.52
in the little video that I posted

1219.919 --> 1223.5200000000002
earlier from X

1225.85 --> 1228.8999999999999
[Music]

1242.43 --> 1245.489
[Music]

1250.24 --> 1253.24
h

1260.65 --> 1267.679
[Music]

1264.84 --> 1271.4399999999998
carriers of electromagnetic field I'm

1267.679 --> 1276.64
not seeing that they said say

1271.44 --> 1276.64
here energy packet of electromagnetic

1277.24 --> 1282.559
radiation so I don't know where you're

1279.2 --> 1282.559
getting that

1291.08 --> 1294.039
hey clutch good to see

1294.2 --> 1297.88
you massless

1299.44 --> 1306.2
particles I don't see the word particle

1302.0 --> 1309.039
in there either which is correct

1306.2 --> 1313.2
it's I mean you could think of a photon

1309.039 --> 1313.2
as a particle but it's technically not a

1314.2 --> 1319.44
particle it might be assigned particle

1318.24 --> 1322.2
state

1319.44 --> 1327.2
this if you're going to present a false

1322.2 --> 1327.2
dichotomy of a wave particle

1328.279 --> 1334.84
duality it's at the end

1330.84 --> 1334.84
what okay

1338.12 --> 1343.539
[Music]

1349.84 --> 1353.9399999999998
all photons travel at the speed of light

1352.12 --> 1357.799
oh really what's the evidence for

1353.94 --> 1357.799
[Music]

1360.24 --> 1367.919
that consider the among subatomic

1364.0 --> 1369.08
particles they're bons okay right so

1367.919 --> 1372.0
this is

1369.08 --> 1375.6399999999999
just particle

1372.0 --> 1379.279
theory conception without

1375.64 --> 1384.039
evidence this is how SCI

1379.279 --> 1384.039
considers it there's no evidence for

1385.0 --> 1388.679
that field

1390.44 --> 1394.679
particles so that's just a bunch of

1393.12 --> 1397.9599999999998
presuppositional

1394.679 --> 1402.8400000000001
reasoning there's no actual evidence for

1397.96 --> 1402.8400000000001
that but yeah thanks for sharing

1406.18 --> 1413.19
[Music]

1422.73 --> 1427.47
[Music]

1426.12 --> 1429.6789999999999
yes I read

1427.47 --> 1431.799
[Music]

1429.679 --> 1434.48
it all

1431.799 --> 1436.36
Theory conception is a better word for

1434.48 --> 1438.84
it I mean there's a

1436.36 --> 1442.24
theory is really a theory when there is

1438.84 --> 1444.559
evidence for it there isn't any it's not

1442.24 --> 1444.559
really

1467.36 --> 1471.36
presented for

1507.52 --> 1511.9189999999999
scientific theory or colloquial Theory

1509.64 --> 1511.919
oh

1518.279 --> 1524.279
that's well that's kind of a

1520.72 --> 1527.039
misdirection by accident I assume I mean

1524.279 --> 1529.44
it's not a colloquial Theory

1527.039 --> 1532.12
either it is is thought of as a

1529.44 --> 1534.3600000000001
scientific theory yet it there's no

1532.12 --> 1536.6789999999999
scientific method-based application to

1534.36 --> 1539.12
it at

1536.679 --> 1543.6000000000001
all so it is more like

1539.12 --> 1547.6
a mistaken to be scientific theory a

1543.6 --> 1547.6
colloquial theory is just like an

1550.44 --> 1554.72
idea so it's like oh I have a theory

1553.039 --> 1558.44
about how this

1554.72 --> 1561.039
happened that's a colloquial Theory

1558.44 --> 1563.279
it's not thought of as a colloquial

1561.039 --> 1565.48
Theory it's just

1563.279 --> 1567.88
wrong and it doesn't have any evidence

1565.48 --> 1567.88
to back

1572.97 --> 1576.029
[Music]

1578.84 --> 1583.52
it right I have my own ideas I don't

1582.44 --> 1587.24
really

1583.52 --> 1589.32
have any experimental data to back it up

1587.24 --> 1592.32
although I have a

1589.32 --> 1594.039
an idea how to figure it

1592.32 --> 1596.399
out

1594.039 --> 1601.6
right it's been a while since I mention

1596.399 --> 1603.6399999999999
it but yeah my idea of what light is

1601.6 --> 1606.12
is a

1603.64 --> 1610.3990000000001
potentially infinitely

1606.12 --> 1610.399
divisible instantaneous

1610.96 --> 1616.8400000000001
beam cuz yeah if it's

1614.0 --> 1618.6
instantaneous it has a beginning and an

1616.84 --> 1620.08
end you can't really call call it a

1618.6 --> 1622.799
particle a

1620.08 --> 1625.96
particle would inherently

1622.799 --> 1628.24
suggest that it has a specific location

1625.96 --> 1631.6000000000001
that will change over

1628.24 --> 1633.36
time if there is a displacement

1631.6 --> 1635.08
happening and I don't think it is I

1633.36 --> 1638.12
think it is a

1635.08 --> 1640.84
beam I think it is instantaneous and I

1638.12 --> 1643.4799999999998
think it is infinitely

1640.84 --> 1644.76
divisible meaning that there is no real

1643.48 --> 1646.6
minimum

1644.76 --> 1649.8799999999999
size

1646.6 --> 1652.36
and it's only through the suggestion of

1649.88 --> 1655.5200000000002
the photoelectric

1652.36 --> 1658.4799999999998
effect the interaction of light with

1655.52 --> 1659.72
matter eliciting a physical response

1658.48 --> 1664.2
from that

1659.72 --> 1666.679
matter that the quanta of Light which is

1664.2 --> 1668.519
what a photon is is

1666.679 --> 1671.519
established but is based on the

1668.519 --> 1671.519
presupposition

1671.88 --> 1676.72
that it it's made dependent on the

1674.6 --> 1680.24
interaction with matter in order to

1676.72 --> 1682.0
establish a supposed minimum

1680.24 --> 1688.519
size

1682.0 --> 1688.519
but this idea could potentially be

1689.72 --> 1695.039
bypassed and I devised a test for that I

1693.0 --> 1697.64
don't know if it's possible

1695.039 --> 1699.399
though I talked about this like even

1697.64 --> 1703.24
three years

1699.399 --> 1706.1589999999999
ago guys on the Flat Earth

1703.24 --> 1710.0
debates a lot with the

1706.159 --> 1713.7600000000002
John uh refracted curv Pi John that is

1710.0 --> 1716.399
that you could prove that light can

1713.76 --> 1720.84
exist

1716.399 --> 1720.84
effectively at lower

1721.519 --> 1729.519
than less than a

1724.48 --> 1732.1200000000001
photon by using Arc pump lasers two of

1729.519 --> 1736.08
them that then

1732.12 --> 1738.8799999999999
project less than a photon worth of

1736.08 --> 1741.799
energy let's say like 3 quars of them

1738.88 --> 1744.3600000000001
and direct them to exactly the same spot

1741.799 --> 1746.8799999999999
on a photoelectric

1744.36 --> 1750.1589999999999
plate if you have one of the arc promp

1746.88 --> 1753.8400000000001
lasers do that there should not be any

1750.159 --> 1759.3600000000001
registry of a no interaction because

1753.84 --> 1762.32
it's not not enough energy to basically

1759.36 --> 1767.76
create the photoelectric effect but if

1762.32 --> 1769.72
you could have 2 * 3/4 worth of photonic

1767.76 --> 1772.519
energy

1769.72 --> 1775.48
projected at exactly the same location

1772.519 --> 1779.2
well then there would be enough to have

1775.48 --> 1782.559
a reaction and that could

1779.2 --> 1784.2
prove that photons are not the minimum

1782.559 --> 1788.279
size and that

1784.2 --> 1788.279
effectively there is no minimum

1788.36 --> 1793.4399999999998
size then you could test like how many

1790.919 --> 1796.159
AR pump lasers and what's the absolute

1793.44 --> 1798.3600000000001
minimum amount of energy output that

1796.159 --> 1799.3600000000001
they could give

1798.36 --> 1802.36
then who

1799.36 --> 1806.6399999999999
knows how small the amount of energy

1802.36 --> 1809.039
could be and still function like light

1806.64 --> 1812.8400000000001
even though it wouldn't be enough to

1809.039 --> 1814.44
interact to re to elicit a reaction from

1812.84 --> 1817.8799999999999
a photoelectric

1814.44 --> 1820.039
plate so that is a test that I have

1817.88 --> 1821.3600000000001
devised in my mind in order to

1820.039 --> 1823.6
potentially

1821.36 --> 1826.24
prove that light

1823.6 --> 1832.279
is infinitely

1826.24 --> 1832.279
divisible and does not have a unit like

1832.679 --> 1837.72
minimum that we know of as a

1835.44 --> 1840.279
photon and it would certainly help

1837.72 --> 1841.96
explain a lot the the the complicated

1840.279 --> 1845.88
dynamics of

1841.96 --> 1849.559
light and how we are able to see so much

1845.88 --> 1849.5590000000002
detail at vast

1850.039 --> 1854.559
distances right because the light has to

1852.48 --> 1857.6390000000001
bridge all this distance and there's

1854.559 --> 1858.639
like Distortion effects refraction all

1857.639 --> 1860.799
that

1858.639 --> 1863.24
well if you think of all that light to

1860.799 --> 1867.559
just be units

1863.24 --> 1870.679
photons it becomes really

1867.559 --> 1874.279
messy but if they're infinitely

1870.679 --> 1878.1200000000001
divisible then it's all just basically a

1874.279 --> 1880.639
spectrum a spectrum of

1878.12 --> 1882.4399999999998
intensity which would

1880.639 --> 1885.6789999999999
yield

1882.44 --> 1888.48
logically much more refined details as

1885.679 --> 1890.799
to the outcome of what you you see at a

1888.48 --> 1890.799
vast

1891.6 --> 1896.1999999999998
distance so it seemed more logical to me

1894.96 --> 1898.96
that light is

1896.2 --> 1901.24
actually infinitely

1898.96 --> 1904.8400000000001
divisible and since there's no real

1901.24 --> 1907.039
evidence for any speed it would be an

1904.84 --> 1911.08
infinitely

1907.039 --> 1911.08
divisible instantaneous

1911.88 --> 1916.8400000000001
beam and that is my model for it that's

1914.679 --> 1919.679
my

1916.84 --> 1923.4399999999998
idea and it could be tested I have not

1919.679 --> 1923.44
tested it so I don't have

1923.639 --> 1929.639
any empirical evidence to back that

1926.399 --> 1934.76
theory but I have devised a test that

1929.639 --> 1936.6789999999999
could be done to back it or it could

1934.76 --> 1939.96
turn out to be

1936.679 --> 1945.0
wrong right but at least you can test

1939.96 --> 1947.48
it that's as how as a theorist how I go

1945.0 --> 1948.639
about I don't just like make something

1947.48 --> 1951.72
up

1948.639 --> 1953.0
that's then like never able to be tested

1951.72 --> 1955.32
and then you're just going to have to

1953.0 --> 1957.919
assume it like

1955.32 --> 1959.559
ether right not testable you're just

1957.919 --> 1962.24
going to have to assume it's there well

1959.559 --> 1962.24
I don't like

1962.44 --> 1967.919
that I find that to be very

1970.36 --> 1976.4399999999998
unscientific and so I prefer my

1973.48 --> 1978.44
conceptions to be

1976.44 --> 1979.96
falsifiable that you can could test

1978.44 --> 1982.559
whether it is true or

1979.96 --> 1986.72
not not that I'm personally going to be

1982.559 --> 1989.039
testing it but that there is a way to

1986.72 --> 1989.039
test

1992.96 --> 1998.519
it what happens in the double slitter

1995.36 --> 2001.519
exp the slits are horizontal not

1998.519 --> 2001.519
vertical

2003.559 --> 2009.84
what well the same thing except the the

2006.48 --> 2013.2
bands split up vertically then clearly

2009.84 --> 2013.1999999999998
that's what happens

2048.159 --> 2052.399
the way the defraction

2050.28 --> 2056.3990000000003
pattern

2052.399 --> 2059.399
emerges is always

2056.399 --> 2061.2
perpendicular to the surface it is that

2059.399 --> 2063.839
is causing the

2061.2 --> 2067.7999999999997
defraction so if you just rotate the

2063.839 --> 2070.48
slits well then the wave pattern not

2067.8 --> 2074.9190000000003
actually a wave with a WAV like pattern

2070.48 --> 2074.919
is going to rotate right with it

2082.9 --> 2086.07
[Music]

2105.64 --> 2108.64
that

2136.68 --> 2140.7599999999998
all right I guess today we're talking

2138.119 --> 2143.0
about light kind of fitting since

2140.76 --> 2146.88
there's like a lot of nice light out

2143.0 --> 2146.88
there sunny day so

2148.319 --> 2154.2
far think it would be based off the

2151.2 --> 2158.2
electro or magnetic

2154.2 --> 2158.2
polarity what

2167.88 --> 2173.44
I don't know what what that has to do

2170.079 --> 2173.44
with light

2176.64 --> 2180.64
defraction I don't I don't know though I

2178.72 --> 2184.24
mean but I don't I've never heard of

2180.64 --> 2187.319
like changing magnetic polarity of light

2184.24 --> 2189.56
in order to have the defraction pattern

2187.319 --> 2189.56
change

2196.48 --> 2203.88
right and I mean light is called

2200.04 --> 2206.4
electromagnetic but it technically isn't

2203.88 --> 2206.4
it's just

2206.88 --> 2211.119
light you say it's on the

2209.04 --> 2214.56
electromagnetic spectrum but I mean

2211.119 --> 2216.079
that's based on a presupposition that of

2214.56 --> 2220.4
of

2216.079 --> 2220.4
unity which there no evidence for

2229.04 --> 2234.2
him oh [ __ ] laser lie that

2239.0 --> 2243.0
sucks yikes

2247.4 --> 2250.59
[Music]

2263.48 --> 2266.76
hello Moxy

2282.2 --> 2285.96
hello duper how the hell are you

2292.72 --> 2297.0789999999997
here I timed you out 24

2299.079 --> 2303.1200000000003
hours is this like another account of

2301.52 --> 2307.0
yours

2303.12 --> 2307.0
[Music]

2324.92 --> 2328.6800000000003
right anyway I hope you're enjoying the

2326.24 --> 2333.2
show so far

2328.68 --> 2335.24
no okay weird maybe the 24-hour timeout

2333.2 --> 2338.9199999999996
only works on a singular stream I'm not

2335.24 --> 2338.9199999999996
sure how that works

2344.8 --> 2347.2000000000003
anyway

2348.28 --> 2354.599
welcome hell debatable

2351.52 --> 2357.56
D hope you all enjoyed the uh the night

2354.599 --> 2357.56
Al bonus stream

2357.66 --> 2362.0
[Music]

2359.48 --> 2364.0
yesterday they tend to be a lot shorter

2362.0 --> 2370.23
but more intense

2364.0 --> 2370.23
[Music]

2373.64 --> 2378.04
what oh yeah

2387.67 --> 2390.7290000000003
[Music]

2398.48 --> 2406.16
yeah that stuff is just weird

2401.96 --> 2409.48
man I mean there's so much presupposed

2406.16 --> 2413.72
in there that that's just wrong so

2409.48 --> 2413.72
clearly I mean these are

2413.839 --> 2418.7999999999997
models these are models that presuppose

2416.599 --> 2421.839
that light is acting like a wave

2418.8 --> 2424.4
somehow in order to

2421.839 --> 2427.0
explain or attempt to

2424.4 --> 2429.359
explain the other things that you could

2427.0 --> 2431.4
do with with light like polarization and

2429.359 --> 2435.2799999999997
all

2431.4 --> 2439.1600000000003
that but there really is no evidence for

2435.28 --> 2439.1600000000003
it to actually be like that at

2448.92 --> 2455.48
all like is a transverse electromagnetic

2452.119 --> 2455.48
yeah right

2484.96 --> 2487.96
h

2497.4 --> 2504.04
okay duper well I guess that somebody

2499.8 --> 2508.7200000000003

2996.92 --> 3000.48
there's not a lot out there I recommend

2998.799 --> 3004.319
at this

3000.48 --> 3006.16
point I guess like Nathan Oakley Flat

3004.319 --> 3009.92
Earth

3006.16 --> 3012.1189999999997
debates it's all very technical but I

3009.92 --> 3015.48
mean yeah you still will be able to

3012.119 --> 3018.4
learn some technical stuff and like good

3015.48 --> 3019.799
arguments other than that no I I don't

3018.4 --> 3022.76
really know

3019.799 --> 3025.7599999999998
any Flat Earth channels that I'd really

3022.76 --> 3025.76
recommend

3027.319 --> 3032.079
what do you do this you did you just

3029.68 --> 3035.0789999999997

3104.599 --> 3110.2400000000002
mean wit it is not really making good

3111.119 --> 3118.079
arguments he talks about ether stuff but

3114.16 --> 3120.16
I mean it's as a flat earther he's not

3118.079 --> 3122.88
really doing all that

3120.16 --> 3124.7599999999998
great I mean he might be popular and all

3122.88 --> 3127.76
that

3124.76 --> 3131.3190000000004
but I mean yeah you might like hanging

earther but

3161.52 --> 3167.24
it

3163.2 --> 3167.24
he's not very

3167.44 --> 3172.92
disciplined and he seems to be focusing

3169.96 --> 3175.119
on ether a lot yeah an etherite this

3172.92 --> 3178.44

earthers not so much that kind of

3605.4 --> 3609.4
started

later it's just like this weird

3609.4 --> 3616.839
competition or something

4663.96 --> 4669.4800000000005
come on and have his wife alongside him

4666.92 --> 4671.719
well he does that fine that's all good

4669.48 --> 4673.638999999999
with me I mean I'm don't have anything

4671.719 --> 4675.28
against it but I mean not just going to

4673.639 --> 4677.1990000000005
be like hey David you want to come on

4675.28 --> 4679.96
and oh yeah please bring your wife I

4677.199 --> 4679.96
mean that's

4680.92 --> 4686.1990000000005
ridiculous

4683.32 --> 4689.799999999999
okay nice to see steamy back yeah I

4686.199 --> 4693.32
agree yeah we had bit of

4689.8 --> 4696.88
a run in a while back but like I think

4693.32 --> 4696.88
we're good now

4712.04 --> 4718.679
right but I mean like a few months ago I

4715.0 --> 4718.679
had a lot of friction with a lot of

4719.44 --> 4726.5599999999995
people and uh I was under high tension

4724.08 --> 4728.88
for quite a while for let's say half a

4726.56 --> 4731.159000000001
year and before that too but I mean the

4728.88 --> 4735.1990000000005
last half year was really

4731.159 --> 4739.159
bad it really was I admit that

4735.199 --> 4739.159
and I couldn't really do anything about

4739.679 --> 4746.1990000000005
it and so the Sparks would just

4742.199 --> 4748.879999999999
regularly fly off and it was a lot of

4746.199 --> 4753.36
the times just trying to keep a lid on

4748.88 --> 4756.679
it trying to keep control over it but uh

4753.36 --> 4758.92
to be fair since I broke off with fed as

4756.679 --> 4761.92
a a regular

4758.92 --> 4763.52
panelist I've become a lot better A lot

4761.92 --> 4767.12
more

4763.52 --> 4769.56
stable cuz it was just all of it was too

4767.12 --> 4769.5599999999995
much of a

4771.92 --> 4778.76
burden it it made me feel like I didn't

4775.12 --> 4778.76
have control over my own life

4779.76 --> 4785.1990000000005
anymore and like even while I was part

4782.719 --> 4787.159
of that I I felt like I had to

4785.199 --> 4790.28
continually

4787.159 --> 4793.799999999999
fight against the rest just to be able

4790.28 --> 4793.8
to be myself

4796.159 --> 4801.199
CU I I had some lip Surfers like oh you

4798.48 --> 4804.678999999999
can be yourself but I really

4801.199 --> 4804.678999999999
couldn't I really

4806.159 --> 4815.599999999999
couldn't so like the chances that I go I

4810.04 --> 4815.6
will go back to Fed are very very

4815.639 --> 4825.8
slim if not just zero but I I love to

4821.12 --> 4825.8
join in with ball busters at times

4826.4 --> 4831.239
but I just can't do all that stuff every

4828.6 --> 4833.96
day anymore and besides I need the room

4831.239 --> 4837.0
I need the room for my own

4833.96 --> 4839.84
show like my show is now a lot longer

4837.0 --> 4841.8
and it just like yeah it goes in the

4839.84 --> 4844.84
same time slot as Nathan Oakley does his

4841.8 --> 4849.2390000000005
show and I need that

4844.84 --> 4852.1990000000005
time I just need it to do my own

4849.239 --> 4855.159
thing and it's been a lot healthier for

4852.199 --> 4857.638999999999
me since I've started doing that

4855.159 --> 4859.599999999999
right and all blessings to him to Nathan

4857.639 --> 4862.36
I mean I don't have anything against

4859.6 --> 4866.0
Nathan it's just it was unhealthy for me

4862.36 --> 4869.36
and had so much commentary from people

4866.0 --> 4872.92
telling me that it was bad for me for

4869.36 --> 4875.639
years guys years people have been

4872.92 --> 4878.2390000000005
telling me this not trolls people that

4875.639 --> 4881.92
are actually genuinely

4878.239 --> 4885.159
caring and I was just like holding on in

4881.92 --> 4888.92
a way in the hopes that

4885.159 --> 4892.199
that I could use fed as a stepping stone

4888.92 --> 4893.92
for my familiarity and all that and and

4892.199 --> 4897.678999999999
it just wasn't

4893.92 --> 4897.679
working it really just

4897.76 --> 4904.04
wasn't it had a suppressing

4900.8 --> 4905.8
effect and it was very unhealthy to the

4904.04 --> 4910.88
point where I had

4905.8 --> 4913.159000000001
literal not metaphorical literal

4910.88 --> 4916.0
hallucinations it was that means it's

4913.159 --> 4917.638999999999
really bad

4916.0 --> 4919.639
when you have to suppress things to the

4917.639 --> 4922.04
point where you literally start to have

4919.639 --> 4924.28
involuntary

4922.04 --> 4927.159
hallucinations that like drive you

4924.28 --> 4931.04
paranoid and [ __ ] so it's like it just

4927.159 --> 4934.599999999999
had to stop it just had to stop it can't

4931.04 --> 4939.36
work it was great being part of

4934.6 --> 4941.280000000001
it have they as been asking me no well

4939.36 --> 4944.159
they did at the

4941.28 --> 4945.04
time but all they want is just like oh

4944.159 --> 4948.48
are we

4945.04 --> 4950.96
just stop making a hassle and just come

4948.48 --> 4952.638999999999
back like usual that's that's what they

4950.96 --> 4954.639
were doing and they were really trying

4952.639 --> 4956.36
to pull at me and I'm telling them like

4954.639 --> 4959.52
no stop

4956.36 --> 4963.48
it I'm literally hallucinating from this

4959.52 --> 4963.4800000000005
[ __ ] you have to stop pulling at

4963.92 --> 4970.679
me and they have and I've restored after

4968.04 --> 4972.56
they stopped doing that and they're not

4970.679 --> 4975.84
doing it

4972.56 --> 4981.04
anymore they're just leaving

4975.84 --> 4983.8
be I mean none of the panelists zero are

4981.04 --> 4987.84
even coming over to my

4983.8 --> 4989.6
chat none they haven't for years by the

4987.84 --> 4992.12
way for

4989.6 --> 4995.120000000001
years even when I ask them like hey why

4992.12 --> 4996.08
don't you come over to my chat sometimes

4995.12 --> 4999.159
they just

4996.08 --> 5001.8
don't just want to sit in that panel of

4999.159 --> 5003.159
Nathan and just do that and that's all

5001.8 --> 5005.92
they seem to want to do they don't want

5003.159 --> 5007.92
to really neate with me they don't

5005.92 --> 5011.04
really want to have a a discussion on an

5007.92 --> 5011.04
arnian level with

5015.0 --> 5020.88
me right and they have judgments about

5018.159 --> 5020.879999999999
my ideas

5022.12 --> 5027.44
too

5024.639 --> 5029.679
so they don't really respect me they

5027.44 --> 5031.638999999999
don't really respect my ideas and what I

5029.679 --> 5036.4400000000005
do that's a

5031.639 --> 5036.4400000000005
fact it's a fact that cannot be

5041.81 --> 5046.320000000001
[Music]

5044.239 --> 5050.0
resolved I don't know what the hell that

5046.32 --> 5050.0
means teaspoons of

5052.719 --> 5059.99
Doom to be a boot licker yeah and I

5056.639 --> 5063.06
absolutely refuse that

5059.99 --> 5063.0599999999995
[Music]

5073.96 --> 5081.4800000000005
yes doesn't yes it does

5077.679 --> 5081.4800000000005
Clary the [ __ ] is that

5093.32 --> 5097.36
about e

5144.6 --> 5146.84
Dam

5153.239 --> 5157.28
it for

5167.47 --> 5173.709
[Music]

5186.4 --> 5189.46
[Music]

5192.159 --> 5196.04
right so yeah doer I don't know what

5193.679 --> 5198.96
you're talking

5196.04 --> 5200.63
about I don't think anybody from fed

5198.96 --> 5206.079
like tried to gas light

5200.63 --> 5206.079
[Music]

5206.4 --> 5211.159
me if guys feels the available volume

5209.719 --> 5215.88
then why do we have

5211.159 --> 5219.599999999999
gradients uh because there's other

5215.88 --> 5222.159000000001
influences that causes the gas that has

5219.6 --> 5223.88
expanded in the available volume to

5222.159 --> 5227.839999999999
redistribute

5223.88 --> 5230.56
itself like temperature

5227.84 --> 5232.96
influences temperature influence on a

5230.56 --> 5234.96
container will cause a gas pressure

5232.96 --> 5239.04
gradient within that

5234.96 --> 5243.84
container coold one side heat on the

5239.04 --> 5247.0
other and then the cold side will become

5243.84 --> 5249.88
low lower pressured and the hot side

5247.0 --> 5252.88
will become higher

5249.88 --> 5252.88
pressured

5255.24 --> 5261.46
[Music]

5264.48 --> 5269.678999999999
yeah right but I mean even that gradient

5267.44 --> 5273.48
doesn't mean that it's

5269.679 --> 5276.56
layers all of that including the lower

5273.48 --> 5279.36
pressure and higher pressure are all in

5276.56 --> 5279.360000000001
continuous

5279.56 --> 5284.320000000001
motion it's just because of the

5281.639 --> 5286.119
temperature influence the way they

5284.32 --> 5289.639
compose themselves with their

5286.119 --> 5289.639
surroundings becomes

5292.84 --> 5297.76
different like the gas the pressure

5296.159 --> 5300.599999999999
somewhat

5297.76 --> 5302.280000000001
retracts in a colder Zone

5300.6 --> 5306.52
and

5302.28 --> 5309.48
expands within the heater hotter

5306.52 --> 5312.280000000001
Zone and that causes an effective

5309.48 --> 5316.0
gradiation within the ever moving

5312.28 --> 5316.0
dynamic system that's just how it

5318.36 --> 5323.239
works okay John suco just [ __ ]

5323.639 --> 5328.96
off don't want your nonsensical

5331.96 --> 5338.2390000000005
[ __ ] yeah just learn it write

5335.52 --> 5340.360000000001
freaking English or get the [ __ ] out and

5338.239 --> 5343.28
since you're not going to write English

5340.36 --> 5343.28
I'm just kicking you

5346.08 --> 5351.719
out yes I'm awake I'm familiar with

5349.36 --> 5351.719
awake

5355.36 --> 5360.92
Souls I just show with him like way back

5358.08 --> 5364.44
during my flat Earth talk days but the

5360.92 --> 5367.56
guy is kind of deranged or he used to be

5364.44 --> 5370.28
maybe he's he's doing a bit better he's

5367.56 --> 5372.2390000000005
very strange type of Christian he's

5370.28 --> 5374.599999999999
extremely

5372.239 --> 5376.839999999999
paranoid and he's a gamma he just

5374.6 --> 5380.280000000001
accuses everybody of being an agent and

5376.84 --> 5383.92
all that so including

5380.28 --> 5386.36
me but he does have some interesting

5383.92 --> 5389.119
ideas he's actually one of the few

5386.36 --> 5393.199
people out there that also

5389.119 --> 5396.04
has looping component suggestions to his

5393.199 --> 5396.04
model

5397.719 --> 5403.0
and he also even like with Graphics

5401.32 --> 5406.4
modeled

5403.0 --> 5408.36
out a system that basically comparts

5406.4 --> 5411.32
with my idea

5408.36 --> 5413.92
of

5411.32 --> 5416.799999999999
non-local angular manifestations of the

5413.92 --> 5421.2390000000005
celestial nonlocal Holograms so he he

5416.8 --> 5421.2390000000005
modeled that in that way very

5422.239 --> 5428.599999999999
interesting so yeah does have some

5424.96 --> 5428.6
interesting ideas but he

5429.119 --> 5434.159
is

5431.44 --> 5437.08
yeah you never really seemed like a very

5434.159 --> 5439.5199999999995
stable person to me like intellectually

5437.08 --> 5442.48
emotionally like yeah I might not be

5439.52 --> 5446.320000000001
super stable or whatever but he's just

5442.48 --> 5446.32
like in Social conduct I

5447.119 --> 5452.04
mean he's worse than me or he used to be

5450.52 --> 5454.52
I don't know what he's like now I don't

5452.04 --> 5456.0
know what the hell he's doing

5454.52 --> 5458.76
I don't think he really wants to

5456.0 --> 5458.76
associate with

5460.05 --> 5464.96
[Music]

5461.92 --> 5468.8
me I've said some bad things about him

5464.96 --> 5471.04
because of the way he's acted towards me

5468.8 --> 5474.04
talked a lot of [ __ ] about me like years

5471.04 --> 5474.04
back

5486.76 --> 5492.1990000000005
right and he is very

5489.0 --> 5492.199
paranoid in

5492.84 --> 5497.639
general and he has a weird sort of

5495.719 --> 5500.679
Messiah

5497.639 --> 5503.76
complex thinks that he's appointed by

5500.679 --> 5506.119
God and the angels to to bring the truth

5503.76 --> 5509.719
as a solitary person I mean he literally

5506.119 --> 5515.679
talked about that back then

5509.719 --> 5515.679
so but I am aware of him duper

5516.94 --> 5520.0199999999995
[Music]

5532.96 --> 5538.44
don't live in a container yeah we do

5535.679 --> 5543.4400000000005
there is gas pressure because there is

5538.44 --> 5543.44
containment it's a necessary anteed

5551.7 --> 5555.5599999999995
[Music]

5571.679 --> 5576.6
no no it's already this distributed

5574.6 --> 5578.639
itself within the

5576.6 --> 5582.2390000000005
container

5578.639 --> 5584.84
then there is influences that are always

5582.239 --> 5587.759999999999
there on the dynamic system a cold

5584.84 --> 5590.6
influence at the top wherever exactly

5587.76 --> 5593.159000000001
that is we don't know but it's up there

5590.6 --> 5596.84
things are colder up there and a heat

5593.159 --> 5598.92
influence here at the ground level it's

5596.84 --> 5602.04
measurably

5598.92 --> 5605.2390000000005
there it will have an influence on the

5602.04 --> 5607.44
gradiation of the moving

5605.239 --> 5609.5199999999995
gases yeah they're not settling in

5607.44 --> 5613.159
layers they are moving around but

5609.52 --> 5616.88
because of the acute temperature

5613.159 --> 5619.36
influences the way they compose

5616.88 --> 5622.2390000000005
themselves all the gas particles in

5619.36 --> 5624.119
relation to everything else is going to

5622.239 --> 5626.919999999999
result in a

5624.119 --> 5630.44
gradiation which is exactly what what's

5626.92 --> 5630.4400000000005
the case so

5635.119 --> 5642.44
right you can only have a gas pressure

5638.199 --> 5644.839999999999
gradient because there is a container in

5642.44 --> 5647.839999999999
which that gradient can form as a

5644.84 --> 5647.84
secondary

5658.4 --> 5662.719
effect right I'm going to take a two

5660.239 --> 5665.718999999999
minute break I'll be right

5662.719 --> 5665.719
back

5692.639 --> 5695.639
for

5708.2 --> 5715.21
[Music]

5722.639 --> 5726.679
for for

5736.64 --> 5739.689
[Music]

5747.69 --> 5750.74
[Music]

5762.72 --> 5765.779
[Music]

5779.32 --> 5783.28
all right then I'm back

5791.199 --> 5796.4
what the hell b d don't don't bring that

5794.159 --> 5796.4
up

5801.4 --> 5811.32
here why can't the cold up there be the

5805.32 --> 5811.32
container because cold is not a barrier

5816.44 --> 5822.199
the only thing that is cooled is the air

5819.08 --> 5822.199
there that is being

5823.08 --> 5829.239
cooled like air can't form a container

5826.84 --> 5831.96
for

5829.239 --> 5835.4
air all has to

5831.96 --> 5839.0
press on all the other air that has to

5835.4 --> 5842.36
then press on the container and on all

5839.0 --> 5844.84
sides cold is not a

5842.36 --> 5849.799999999999
container it's it's like an influence on

5844.84 --> 5849.8
the gas it can't contain the gas

5874.239 --> 5878.839999999999
right anyway hope everybody's

5876.719 --> 5882.4
entertained thus far don't forget to

5878.84 --> 5882.400000000001
share the show and Rogan's it

5882.719 --> 5889.08
up I am going to round out the show in

5885.96 --> 5889.08
not too long from

5890.119 --> 5895.199
now I have an appointment here

5907.56 --> 5914.360000000001
right but tomorrow I will certainly be

5911.08 --> 5917.199
back and just uh things should be back

5914.36 --> 5919.719
to normal hopefully some more nice

5917.199 --> 5919.719
weather as

5921.8 --> 5929.1990000000005
well big no I don't know what the hell

5924.32 --> 5929.199
you're talking about gr rag vuno no

5931.48 --> 5937.5199999999995
idea if there isn't this space vacuum

5934.4 --> 5937.5199999999995
why would you need

5948.0 --> 5957.32
containment well if there isn't a space

5952.88 --> 5960.08
vacuum then what is there right I mean

5957.32 --> 5963.92
the the containment and the space vacuum

5960.08 --> 5965.92
are mutually exclusive

5963.92 --> 5967.719
so if there isn't a space vacuum out

5965.92 --> 5969.719
there

5967.719 --> 5976.04
then what is

5969.719 --> 5976.04
there well containment a barrier

5999.9 --> 6003.759999999999
[Music]

6005.52 --> 6008.96
doesn't make sense what do you mean

6007.239 --> 6013.04
doesn't make sense what are you not

6008.96 --> 6015.92
buying it's natural law gas pressure

6013.04 --> 6017.199
requires containment it's how you

6015.92 --> 6021.84
calculate

6017.199 --> 6026.199
it yeah the idea of a space vacuum was

6021.84 --> 6026.1990000000005
literally conjured up and invent

6040.56 --> 6046.320000000001
it this can also be a force field this

6047.8 --> 6054.1990000000005
is

6050.199 --> 6054.199
uh well

6054.36 --> 6058.0
maybe I mean but like what the hell is

6056.44 --> 6059.5199999999995
creating the force field the point is

6058.0 --> 6062.199
there has to be

6059.52 --> 6065.4400000000005
containment however that happens whether

6062.199 --> 6068.44
that's because of some weird mysterious

6065.44 --> 6072.28
God technology or just because there's

6068.44 --> 6075.839999999999
no more available volume

6072.28 --> 6079.36
non-space right just marking the end of

6075.84 --> 6081.76
available volume or a physical structure

6079.36 --> 6084.119
I mean it's not really relevant the

6081.76 --> 6087.56
point is is that in order to have any

6084.119 --> 6091.639
kind of stable gas pressure as we do you

6087.56 --> 6091.639
have to have a limited available

6092.76 --> 6097.76
volume for the gas to exist

6106.639 --> 6113.52
in wouldn't it just stop or something

6110.36 --> 6115.08
yeah well as I said if there's no more

6113.52 --> 6118.679
available

6115.08 --> 6121.199
volume then it could be nons space I

6118.679 --> 6124.1990000000005
addressed that started addressing that

6121.199 --> 6126.799999999999
years ago is that maybe some kind of

6124.199 --> 6128.719
option like it would be experienced like

6126.8 --> 6131.92
a physical barrier but I mean it would

6128.719 --> 6134.8
simply be yeah no more available space

6131.92 --> 6137.96
for matter to exist

6134.8 --> 6140.320000000001
in and that would effectively function

6137.96 --> 6140.32
like a

6141.159 --> 6148.44
barrier is the Moon inside the

6145.32 --> 6150.799999999999
containment uh I don't think the Moon is

6148.44 --> 6153.119
every anywhere it's it's a light

6150.8 --> 6156.76
projection it doesn't have an actual

6153.119 --> 6156.759999999999
location only an apparent

6163.88 --> 6168.32
one same goes for all the celestial

6168.719 --> 6173.599
lights so yeah you could think of them

6171.599 --> 6176.2390000000005
as being inside the containment but they

6173.599 --> 6179.8
don't have actual positions with inside

6176.239 --> 6183.919999999999
of the containment they're just

6179.8 --> 6187.159000000001
visible there's a angular light

6183.92 --> 6189.96
manifestation that arrives and that's it

6187.159 --> 6192.5599999999995
that's the only evidence we really

6189.96 --> 6196.04
have right there's no proof that it is

6192.56 --> 6198.679
emanating from a source point or

6196.04 --> 6198.679
physical

6200.48 --> 6207.08
object just because it may appear here

6203.48 --> 6208.959999999999
to look to us as observers like it could

6207.08 --> 6212.119
be a physical object does it mean that

6208.96 --> 6214.76
it is provably it isn't there's no proof

6212.119 --> 6219.719
that it is other than

6214.76 --> 6219.719
appearances oh H ready yeah

6221.48 --> 6228.839999999999
no nonlinear holographic manifestation

6225.56 --> 6230.56
what no

6228.84 --> 6236.119000000001
nonlocal

6230.56 --> 6236.119000000001
holographic angular manifestation I

6253.93 --> 6256.9890000000005
[Music]

6300.44 --> 6303.36
no not

6304.0 --> 6310.0
nonlinear are you just trying to do it

6307.4 --> 6312.28
wrong on purpose or are you this

6310.0 --> 6315.52
dyslectic that you just can't get it

6312.28 --> 6315.5199999999995
right one freaking

6321.96 --> 6325.96
time for

6337.7 --> 6340.76
[Music]

6353.32 --> 6362.719
but doesn't angular mean it's nonlinear

6356.92 --> 6367.52
no angular means angular it means angle

6362.719 --> 6371.52
based an angle

6367.52 --> 6375.719
nonlinear is automatically not an angle

6371.52 --> 6378.84
because guess what an angle is linear

6375.719 --> 6382.76
that's what makes it an angle that it's

6378.84 --> 6385.84
linear lines of an angle are linear so

6382.76 --> 6389.04
it's could never ever under any

6385.84 --> 6392.92
circumstances be

6389.04 --> 6396.32
nonlinear okay don't be

6392.92 --> 6399.599
ridiculous if it's angular then it is

6396.32 --> 6399.599
going to be

6401.599 --> 6409.52
linear there is no nonlinear angle that

6406.0 --> 6412.199
doesn't exist only exists within

6409.52 --> 6413.639
ridiculous terrestrial standard

6412.199 --> 6415.36
refraction

6413.639 --> 6418.719
bendy line

6415.36 --> 6418.719
math not

6424.08 --> 6430.5599999999995
reality angles are straight lines it's

6427.679 --> 6430.56
always going to be

6438.0 --> 6443.0
linear

6440.199 --> 6446.799999999999
yeah the only thing that might be non

6443.0 --> 6446.8
linear within the range of my

6450.92 --> 6456.159
conceptions is within the potential of

6454.52 --> 6460.0
how the realm

6456.159 --> 6462.719
Loops right the loop of the realm the

6460.0 --> 6465.199
available space and how it interconnects

6462.719 --> 6468.599
with itself might be

6465.199 --> 6471.44
nonlinear but that's the available

6468.599 --> 6473.76
volume there might be a nonlinear

6471.44 --> 6475.638999999999
spatial trait to the the available

6473.76 --> 6477.639
volume of the realm and how it

6475.639 --> 6481.400000000001
interconnects with

6477.639 --> 6484.8
itself it is completely separate from

6481.4 --> 6489.04
the celestial lights are

6484.8 --> 6492.119000000001
nonlocal holographic angular

6489.04 --> 6495.32
manifestations they're two completely

6492.119 --> 6498.598999999999
different things that are absolutely not

6495.32 --> 6500.88
connected other than you see the angular

6498.599 --> 6503.4400000000005
manifestations in the realm and that's

6500.88 --> 6507.119
it

6503.44 --> 6512.159
they're not tied in or dependent in a

6507.119 --> 6512.159
direct Sense on each other whatsoever

6521.33 --> 6527.239
[Music]

6523.199 --> 6528.28
nonrelated what does the local part mean

6527.239 --> 6530.799999999999
it's

6528.28 --> 6533.759999999999
nonlocal specifically

6530.8 --> 6536.1990000000005
nonlocal nonlocal

6533.76 --> 6539.599
holographic angular manifestation not

6536.199 --> 6541.929999999999
local holographic angular manifestation

6539.599 --> 6544.8
non

6541.93 --> 6548.76
[Music]

6544.8 --> 6553.52
local what does non-local mean it means

6548.76 --> 6553.52
that there is no specific

6554.92 --> 6561.84
position that if you move that the

6558.679 --> 6564.96
angular manifestation of the celestial

6561.84 --> 6569.400000000001
light moves with you because it's

6564.96 --> 6569.4
non-local yeah it's a non-local

6569.719 --> 6576.199
hologram Holograms that we make with

6572.52 --> 6578.92
technology are local it's in a specific

6576.199 --> 6581.638999999999
location generated there then you move

6578.92 --> 6584.119
up to it and then the angular size to

6581.639 --> 6588.119
you will increase because you're

6584.119 --> 6591.08
approaching the local hologram yeah

6588.119 --> 6593.08
Celestial lights specifically don't do

6591.08 --> 6596.239
that

6593.08 --> 6599.239
you can't approach them because they're

6596.239 --> 6599.239
non

6602.28 --> 6609.239
local they move with

6605.56 --> 6613.76
you the apparent distance doesn't

6609.239 --> 6613.759999999999
decrease when you attempt to approach

6617.04 --> 6621.04
them non-local

6632.679 --> 6635.76
right debatable D

6636.96 --> 6642.96
correct is this sort of like those you

6639.92 --> 6642.96
could compare it to

6643.56 --> 6650.079000000001
that if you'd like but I mean there is

6647.32 --> 6652.679
no painting that can actually

6650.079 --> 6655.719
effectively mimic the celestial light

6652.679 --> 6660.679
the celestial lights are so damn

6655.719 --> 6663.119
unique that we can't replicate them we

6660.679 --> 6666.639
can't replicate the effect of the

6663.119 --> 6669.92
celestial lights in any form we can

6666.639 --> 6674.599
sloppily mimic

6669.92 --> 6678.36
it but it we can't create non-local

6674.599 --> 6680.639
Holograms it's a unique thing it's part

6678.36 --> 6683.598999999999
of the design of the realm we don't know

6680.639 --> 6687.36
how to make it maybe some technologist

6683.599 --> 6690.76
out there knows how to add to or detract

6687.36 --> 6692.759999999999
from the celestial system I don't know

6690.76 --> 6695.119000000001
how to and if they know they're keeping

6692.76 --> 6695.119000000001
it a

6695.48 --> 6700.718999999999
secret as far as I'm concerned there is

6697.92 --> 6704.4
no knowledge of like how the

6700.719 --> 6706.92
celestial lights actually work how they

6704.4 --> 6710.239
are manifesting the way they are we

6706.92 --> 6710.2390000000005
don't know

6715.22 --> 6722.0
[Music]

6718.239 --> 6725.44
The Horizon is non local

6722.0 --> 6725.44
no no it

6728.28 --> 6736.119
isn't why are you just inserting

6732.32 --> 6738.84
that like oh I know a new word nonlocal

6736.119 --> 6742.36
let's just randomly barf it out onto

6738.84 --> 6744.4800000000005
other things how about you don't do that

6742.36 --> 6747.199
yeah there is no other thing that it

6744.48 --> 6750.678999999999
applies to it only applies to the

6747.199 --> 6754.239
celestial lights there are no things no

6750.679 --> 6756.92
objects or visual effects relating to

6754.239 --> 6760.119
objects that are

6756.92 --> 6762.92
non-local it's only the celestial lights

6760.119 --> 6764.719
everything else is local because the

6762.92 --> 6769.719
Horizon is

6764.719 --> 6772.28
based on a visual effect that comes from

6769.719 --> 6775.159
material and the light interacting with

6772.28 --> 6778.8
you all that material has an actual

6775.159 --> 6781.92
distance so it's not non-local they're

6778.8 --> 6784.4800000000005
actually there you can approach them the

6781.92 --> 6787.96
angular size of it will increase yeah

6784.48 --> 6789.32
the Horizon is an effect a side effect

6787.96 --> 6792.88
if you

6789.32 --> 6797.0
will of your visual

6792.88 --> 6800.7300000000005
interaction with local

6797.0 --> 6803.77
things it's not non-local

6800.73 --> 6803.7699999999995
[Music]

6808.159 --> 6813.5599999999995
although you could argue that the

6809.719 --> 6815.36
Horizon as a side effect is nonlocal I

6813.56 --> 6818.84
guess but I

6815.36 --> 6823.199
mean it's just a visual side

6818.84 --> 6826.32
effect of the Earth being flat by the

6823.199 --> 6827.5199999999995
way you're not sure how to unravel this

6826.32 --> 6833.36
yeah

6827.52 --> 6833.360000000001
don't don't unravel it just listen

6841.1 --> 6844.159000000001
[Music]

6845.4 --> 6852.92
correct debatable D yeah that's a pretty

6848.32 --> 6852.92
good translation of what I just said

6872.7 --> 6875.76
[Music]

6876.32 --> 6881.719
all right so yeah the Horizon as a

6878.88 --> 6881.719
visual

6881.84 --> 6887.28
effect

6883.4 --> 6887.28
is permanently at a

6888.96 --> 6893.76
distance like the effect is at a

6891.199 --> 6895.799999999999
distance I I guess in in that sense you

6893.76 --> 6898.1990000000005
could compare it to the

6895.8 --> 6899.1990000000005
celestials but I mean the celestials are

6898.199 --> 6900.799999999999
not

6899.199 --> 6903.5599999999995
caused

6900.8 --> 6907.079000000001
by physical things

6903.56 --> 6909.719
provably they're just angular

6907.079 --> 6912.239
manifestations without any traceable

6909.719 --> 6912.2390000000005
physical

6915.28 --> 6922.32
origin while the Horizon does have a

6918.159 --> 6922.32
traceable physical origin

6922.48 --> 6926.5199999999995
that physical origin being the ground at

6925.719 --> 6929.04
a

6926.52 --> 6930.92
distance and the visual interaction

6929.04 --> 6936.84
there

6930.92 --> 6939.639
with so it's almost like the celestial

6936.84 --> 6942.679
non-local nature but not

6939.639 --> 6949.679
really because the celestial non-local

6942.679 --> 6949.679
Nature has no traceable physical origin

6957.04 --> 6960.0
yeah well you thought

6962.719 --> 6967.4
wrong I don't know why the hell you ever

6965.32 --> 6969.239
thought that I've never said anything

6967.4 --> 6971.719
like that

6969.239 --> 6975.28
ever yeah I

6971.719 --> 6978.04
didn't derive the non-local nature of

6975.28 --> 6981.36
the celestials from anything that I've

6978.04 --> 6984.679
ever read out there I figured it out

6981.36 --> 6987.4
from scratch and and I named it from

6984.679 --> 6990.4
scratch there's nothing that I derived

6987.4 --> 6990.4
it from or took it

6991.079 --> 6997.159
from yes it is something that I came up

6994.079 --> 7003.719
with it's something that I learned to

6997.159 --> 7003.719
describe in that way it's my descriptor

7030.56 --> 7033.8
okay whatever debatable

7037.2 --> 7045.159
[Music]

7041.159 --> 7045.159
d for

7061.0 --> 7064.13
[Music]

7081.56 --> 7084.609
[Applause]

7094.61 --> 7097.7
[Music]

7098.159 --> 7104.119
H I got a response from David Wise he is

7100.44 --> 7104.119
actually willing to come on so that's

7114.71 --> 7118.56
[Music]

7116.8 --> 7122.4800000000005
School

7118.56 --> 7122.4800000000005
H looking forward to

7130.159 --> 7134.5599999999995
that that is impressive thank

7134.88 --> 7140.84
you I thought so I mean I thought it was

7137.32 --> 7142.759999999999
a really good idea a good way to

7140.84 --> 7146.079
describe something that is utterly

7142.76 --> 7148.56
mysterious and people continually fall

7146.079 --> 7153.159
into physicality assumption bias over

7148.56 --> 7156.079000000001
the confusion of it and my non-local

7153.159 --> 7159.32
holographic angular manifestation

7156.079 --> 7162.88
description is

7159.32 --> 7165.199
specifically created to talk totally

7162.88 --> 7169.2390000000005
bypass all forms of physicality

7165.199 --> 7171.879999999999
assumption bias that's what I literally

7169.239 --> 7171.879999999999
created it

7178.88 --> 7186.4800000000005
for yeah Greg Brunel dude

7183.239 --> 7186.48
just just

7188.4 --> 7192.839999999999
stop nobody cares

7202.28 --> 7207.84
how is it nonlocal when it eclipses the

7205.199 --> 7209.759999999999
Sun what you mean one nonlocal

7207.84 --> 7211.400000000001
holographic angular

7209.76 --> 7215.04
manifestation

7211.4 --> 7217.5599999999995
negating another non-local angular holog

7215.04 --> 7219.96
nonlocal holographic angular

7217.56 --> 7222.280000000001
manifestation what blocking what do you

7219.96 --> 7224.159
mean blocking it's negating you can't

7222.28 --> 7227.0
even prove that anything is blocked by

7224.159 --> 7231.04
saying it is blocked you're IM you're

7227.0 --> 7235.119
automatically per default invoking a

7231.04 --> 7237.119
physical object and position there's no

7235.119 --> 7239.88
evidence there's no evidence that an

7237.119 --> 7243.159
eclipse is a physical object blocking

7239.88 --> 7246.679
anything just because it seems like that

7243.159 --> 7250.598999999999
yeah just like the supposed Moon Creator

7246.679 --> 7253.4400000000005
Shadows seem like they Shadows there is

7250.599 --> 7254.84
no evidence that they are

7253.44 --> 7258.199
just because it

7254.84 --> 7260.1990000000005
appears psychologically to The Observer

7258.199 --> 7263.5199999999995
that they are doesn't mean that that is

7260.199 --> 7266.04
evidence that they are yeah appearances

7263.52 --> 7266.040000000001
can be

7268.76 --> 7274.88
deceiving and are not to be considered

7272.239 --> 7274.879999999999
tangible

7275.0 --> 7280.0
evidence so what happens to it

7282.28 --> 7285.84
well it gets

7287.599 --> 7293.92
negated that's what happens part of the

7290.96 --> 7295.199
celestial light gets negated by another

7293.92 --> 7298.56
Celestial

7295.199 --> 7302.32
light and to The Observer that will

7298.56 --> 7304.079000000001
appear like an object is blocking it but

7302.32 --> 7305.719
it's just an appearance there's no

7304.079 --> 7310.079
evidence that there is an actual

7305.719 --> 7310.079
physical thing blocking anything

7312.5 --> 7315.569
[Music]

7315.76 --> 7321.639
right Greg bruny you seem to be getting

7318.079 --> 7321.639
it at this point that's

7327.44 --> 7333.32
good is the sun non local too yeah

7331.0 --> 7333.32
that's

7334.64 --> 7340.079000000001
[Music]

7336.159 --> 7343.239
right all of the celestial lights are

7340.079 --> 7345.239
non-local all of it including the Sun

7343.239 --> 7347.079
and the Moon and the planets and the

7345.239 --> 7348.879999999999
stars and

7347.079 --> 7353.04
comets

7348.88 --> 7356.2390000000005
and flashing by Falling

7353.04 --> 7358.88
Stars I mean there's some meteors that

7356.239 --> 7362.32
may actually be physical and they leave

7358.88 --> 7365.36
stuff here that's a big big mystery that

7362.32 --> 7368.96
will remain a mystery I have ideas about

7365.36 --> 7368.96
it but it's a completely separate

7369.159 --> 7379.96
subject but anything that stays up

7373.56 --> 7382.1990000000005
there and is visible is part of the non

7379.96 --> 7384.52
local holographic angular manifestations

7382.199 --> 7384.5199999999995
of the

7386.05 --> 7393.06
[Music]

7399.48 --> 7406.4
celestials microwave yeah sure you could

7402.639 --> 7406.400000000001
think of it as a wave whatever

7407.85 --> 7411.109
[Applause]

7414.639 --> 7418.159000000001
man whatever

7423.8 --> 7429.52
Frank it's total

7426.96 --> 7432.32
nonsense can't make any light on the

7429.52 --> 7435.0
Moon from Earth

7432.32 --> 7438.36
it's all

7435.0 --> 7438.36
deception all of

7438.48 --> 7444.0
it and land on the moon you can't

7441.36 --> 7446.28
approach the moon you can't influence

7444.0 --> 7449.92
the way the Moon

7446.28 --> 7453.92
looks if you're really unusually lucky

7449.92 --> 7456.36
you might even see a star of some kind

7453.92 --> 7456.36
through the

7456.719 --> 7462.44
moon it's been said to being spotted in

7460.52 --> 7464.400000000001
the past so

7462.44 --> 7470.36
you can't change anything visual about

7464.4 --> 7470.36
it so if people claim that they're just

7472.28 --> 7477.719
liars CGI no there's no computer

7478.159 --> 7484.239
involved yeah computers are man-made

7481.28 --> 7487.36
devices and uh there's no man-made

7484.239 --> 7487.36
device that is creating

7488.76 --> 7495.559
it I mean you could

7492.04 --> 7499.04
just lie he Red's rhetoric could just

7495.559 --> 7501.400000000001
lie about oh look we've made this little

7499.04 --> 7503.599
light and then he could CGI it into some

7501.4 --> 7506.598999999999
image sure he could do that I mean I

7503.599 --> 7506.599
wouldn't put it beneath

7516.52 --> 7522.02
[Music]

7519.559 --> 7525.159000000001
him what are you talking about de

7522.02 --> 7525.159000000001
[Music]

7528.0 --> 7534.559
bable they got from Earth try see oh no

7530.92 --> 7534.559
doubt no doubt Greg

7536.4 --> 7541.598999999999
runel live nobody cares

7542.62 --> 7545.67
[Music]

7557.079 --> 7562.159
I mean Red's rhetoric has been like

7559.119 --> 7564.759999999999
blatantly caught lying and committing

7562.159 --> 7566.879999999999
fraud lying to his audience in the past

7564.76 --> 7569.639
no I'm not going to [ __ ] sight when

7566.88 --> 7572.52
that happened that's like a decade

7569.639 --> 7574.28
ago like it's not a reliable source for

7572.52 --> 7576.119000000001
anything they're Globe belief

7574.28 --> 7578.0
reinforcers and they're very much

7576.119 --> 7580.88
willing to commit fraud to fool Their

7578.0 --> 7584.88
audience to reinforce their Globe belief

7580.88 --> 7584.88
so no body cares

7590.11 --> 7593.179999999999
[Music]

7620.93 --> 7627.13
[Music]

7632.599 --> 7638.599
I could disc I don't know what the hell

7634.28 --> 7638.599
I'm going to discuss with Dave duper

7639.11 --> 7643.839999999999
[Music]

7642.0 --> 7646.92
I don't know if he'd be willing to I

7643.84 --> 7650.079
mean David Weiss is very much onto

7646.92 --> 7653.2390000000005
physicality assumption byas he makes

7650.079 --> 7656.32
regular videos about how the Sun is

7653.239 --> 7659.119
local and supposed demonstration videos

7656.32 --> 7662.599
to try to explain how what we

7659.119 --> 7664.839999999999
see based on a physical Assumption of

7662.599 --> 7668.4800000000005
its location so I don't know if he would

7664.84 --> 7671.04
be willing to discuss those my technical

7668.48 --> 7672.36
ideas I don't know what he wants to talk

7671.04 --> 7674.719
about

7672.36 --> 7674.719
we'll

7689.079 --> 7693.84
see in a way I'd actually be more

7691.76 --> 7696.04
interested in talking about Community

7693.84 --> 7696.04
with

7698.36 --> 7704.679
him and not so technical because I I

7701.159 --> 7704.679
don't want end up bickering with

7704.71 --> 7707.77
[Music]

7716.079 --> 7719.079
him

7719.88 --> 7724.639
no the

7721.96 --> 7727.8
[ __ ] what the hell are you blabbering

7724.639 --> 7731.04
about a new component for the app what

7727.8 --> 7731.04
the [ __ ]

7735.48 --> 7740.239
like why why are you even bringing that

7742.88 --> 7750.0
up there is no

7746.0 --> 7752.88
point no I'm not going to insert my

7750.0 --> 7756.32
conceptions in his [ __ ]

7752.88 --> 7756.32
app stop

7758.04 --> 7762.96
it they're not compatible

7773.76 --> 7781.719
dumbass I'm going to have a talk with

7777.52 --> 7785.8
him talking with him not trying to force

7781.719 --> 7789.8
my [ __ ] stuff into his work you got

7785.8 --> 7789.8
it yeah

7795.52 --> 7800.52
stop it just [ __ ] stop

7816.32 --> 7819.96
already all right so I'm going to round

7818.76 --> 7823.320000000001
out the

7819.96 --> 7825.0
show is this is is [ __ ]

7823.32 --> 7830.88
pointless

7825.0 --> 7830.88
yeah stop when I say stop I mean

7831.559 --> 7836.28
stop that doesn't mean you get to

7834.199 --> 7838.36
[ __ ] blabber on about the same

7836.28 --> 7841.5199999999995
goddamn thing I told you to stop about

7838.36 --> 7841.5199999999995
for another 15

7849.32 --> 7854.32
minutes starting to piss me off and I

7852.239 --> 7858.119
can't afford to be pissed off right now

7854.32 --> 7858.119
because I got an appointment in 15

7860.0 --> 7863.199
minutes all

7867.159 --> 7874.96
right yeah well [ __ ]

7870.28 --> 7877.88
off when I say stop I mean

stop if you do that one more time I will

7877.88 --> 7884.679
kick you the [ __ ] out when I tell you to

7880.679 --> 7887.599
stop I mean you stop it doesn't mean you

7887.599 --> 7893.400000000001
another few

7889.96 --> 7893.4
times you got

7899.0 --> 7904.92
it I don't care how good you think my

7902.119 --> 7907.92
ideas are when I tell you to stop you

7918.32 --> 7923.84
really interesting even though it's

7920.4 --> 7923.839999999999
starting to piss me off at the

7924.32 --> 7930.719
end right yeah who the [ __ ] you think

7927.8 --> 7930.719
I'm talking about

was great

7941.8 --> 7948.52
very technical amicable

7944.88 --> 7952.04
mostly till people start whining me oh

7948.52 --> 7954.599
AR just force your [ __ ] crap like oh

7952.04 --> 7956.76
somebody says hello contact well that's

7954.599 --> 7960.2390000000005
an opportunity to completely try to

7956.76 --> 7962.599
force all your incompatible crap on

7960.239 --> 7965.879999999999
him what you think I'm some kind of

7962.599 --> 7968.32
antisocial deranged person you think

7965.88 --> 7970.88
that if I keep doing that that anybody

7968.32 --> 7971.88
wants to have any contact with me ever

7970.88 --> 7974.28
