125.36 --> 129.84
uh

126.159 --> 129.84
the weather today is

130.16 --> 133.92
restless

132.16 --> 136.79999999999998
cloudy

133.92 --> 140.48
and yeah a lot of wind

136.8 --> 143.64000000000001
and yeah the clouds are rushing by

140.48 --> 143.64
up there

145.44 --> 151.35999999999999
hasn't been any rain so far but it's

147.76 --> 155.879
just it's constant wind and yeah it's

151.36 --> 155.87900000000002
making me restless as well

160.64 --> 165.35999999999999
all right even though it's not even

162.16 --> 165.35999999999999
super cold or anything

165.76 --> 172.319
i think it's like 12 degrees or

168.0 --> 172.319
something let's see double check

175.519 --> 179.84
yeah 12 degrees that's right

181.68 --> 187.28
anyway

182.84 --> 190.64000000000001
uh low stone monkey first in chat

187.28 --> 192.56
crockett kevlar adam meekin jeff gassett

190.64 --> 198.83999999999997
good to see you all

192.56 --> 198.84
it is saturday the 29th of january 2022

201.28 --> 207.04
i think i'm probably gonna have a

204.64 --> 208.79899999999998
bit more quiet show than yesterday in a

207.04 --> 210.959
way i hope because

208.799 --> 214.959
yesterday's show which was exceptionally

210.959 --> 218.159
long and extremely intense

214.959 --> 218.159
it was very draining

218.239 --> 222.56
anyway it was extremely good and

220.56 --> 226.4
interesting and inspiring and it was on

222.56 --> 227.36
a full flow the entire time but

226.4 --> 229.36
like

227.36 --> 230.64000000000001
after i stopped the show it wouldn't

229.36 --> 233.28
kind of stop

230.64 --> 236.64
and kept me up restless for quite a

233.28 --> 238.0
while actually called my healer

236.64 --> 239.439
to

238.0 --> 242.64
help me to

239.439 --> 244.56
get back in my body fully

242.64 --> 247.599
and stop like the

244.56 --> 251.519
the marching in the spiritual realm

247.599 --> 251.51899999999998
because it was all just very intense

252.48 --> 255.439
and yeah

253.599 --> 257.84
also of course for those that have

255.439 --> 261.199
watched through the entire thing

257.84 --> 264.56
somewhere at the end part i'd also like

261.199 --> 267.36
i snapped pretty hard and rest ahead

264.56 --> 270.32
and he was pissed off

267.36 --> 272.08000000000004
and understandably so

270.32 --> 274.88
but at the same time

272.08 --> 277.03999999999996
i was pissed off too because

274.88 --> 279.759
very subtle things

277.04 --> 282.759
and we have talked about it afterward on

279.759 --> 282.759
skype

284.0 --> 288.72
that

285.759 --> 289.68
because it's a subtlety it's

288.72 --> 291.91900000000004
it's

289.68 --> 294.88
not even a technicality

291.919 --> 297.28
it's just something that he typically

294.88 --> 299.759
typically likes to do

297.28 --> 301.19899999999996
because rasta hat has had a lot of

299.759 --> 302.96000000000004
criticism

301.199 --> 305.68
on bible believers and he's very

302.96 --> 308.0
outspoken about it so if somebody then

305.68 --> 310.88
proceeds to criticize them he kind of

308.0 --> 313.28
makes a habit of it to

310.88 --> 313.28
start

313.52 --> 318.24
doing his thing

315.68 --> 321.84000000000003
which really is just kind of mocking

318.24 --> 324.24
christ to be fair even though he's

321.84 --> 325.35999999999996
not even like consciously trying to do

324.24 --> 328.0
that

325.36 --> 331.6
and then i found it extremely disruptive

328.0 --> 333.919
in that moment when i was like really

331.6 --> 335.68
tippy-toppy peeking

333.919 --> 338.15999999999997
in my energy

335.68 --> 340.72
and he kind of brought me out of balance

338.16 --> 342.88000000000005
in that way and that made the entire

340.72 --> 346.16
energy peak

342.88 --> 348.24
bend into a raging outburst

346.16 --> 350.639
and that's what happened i explained it

348.24 --> 350.639
to him

351.6 --> 356.8
and

352.96 --> 358.63899999999995
i think that overall he agreed

356.8 --> 360.24
so i basically asked him like could you

358.639 --> 362.88
please every time there's a serious

360.24 --> 364.40000000000003
religious discussion on my channel

362.88 --> 367.199
just

364.4 --> 368.31899999999996
try to stay out of it

367.199 --> 370.0
because

368.319 --> 373.6
i personally

370.0 --> 373.6
find it very disruptive

373.759 --> 378.96000000000004
when you're there doing that

377.36 --> 381.84000000000003
and it's like not it's not like the

378.96 --> 381.84
first time right

382.08 --> 387.75899999999996
and it is yeah it's not even like he's

384.72 --> 390.96000000000004
again doing that

387.759 --> 395.36
like to sabotage knowingly it's just

390.96 --> 397.84
that it it turns into that by accident

395.36 --> 399.28000000000003
because of the

397.84 --> 402.0
chemistry

399.28 --> 402.0
between us

402.4 --> 405.84
it's all very complicated

406.08 --> 411.12
but yeah i

408.639 --> 414.24
needed to explain that

411.12 --> 414.24
a little bit more calm

414.56 --> 416.88
all right

418.16 --> 423.84000000000003
so today i'm definitely not energy

420.4 --> 423.84
peaking like that

424.56 --> 427.84
and yeah

426.479 --> 430.08
but still

427.84 --> 432.0
there was plenty of things

430.08 --> 434.31899999999996
rolling through my head afterwards

432.0 --> 437.84
subjects that i could tackle

434.319 --> 440.8
and also a bit of regrets on my part

437.84 --> 444.56
because for example i really

440.8 --> 446.72
would like to readdress i

444.56 --> 446.72
the

447.28 --> 451.75899999999996
yeah the horse

448.84 --> 454.0
dewormer and just be completely free

451.759 --> 455.039
about it because

454.0 --> 457.44
way back

455.039 --> 460.24
i made a prediction about it

457.44 --> 463.919
huh do you any of you remember i made a

460.24 --> 466.24
prediction about ivor muck yeah i've ivy

463.919 --> 466.24
yeah

466.96 --> 469.28
and i

469.4 --> 473.599
incredibly called it

472.16 --> 477.28000000000003
right

473.599 --> 478.639
and as i've been the only one

477.28 --> 481.67999999999995
to actually

478.639 --> 481.68
put it out like that

481.759 --> 486.47900000000004
because i felt something was about it

483.919 --> 488.31899999999996
that there was a

486.479 --> 490.8
that it was like a

488.319 --> 493.52000000000004
miracle cure

490.8 --> 495.44
emphasis on miracle because of what it

493.52 --> 496.96
can do and the little side effects it

495.44 --> 501.52
really has

496.96 --> 502.479
and it's turning out that it can even

501.52 --> 505.039
well

502.479 --> 509.84
disrupt

505.039 --> 511.919
yeah the influences from the jabs

509.84 --> 513.4399999999999
like what that does secretly in your

511.919 --> 516.3199999999999
body and the

513.44 --> 520.399
nano formation and all that

516.32 --> 521.44
it actually disrupts that

520.399 --> 524.0
right

521.44 --> 526.8000000000001
and that i basically called that even

524.0 --> 529.04
before there were any

526.8 --> 532.3599999999999
jabs put on the market

529.04 --> 532.36
just saying

534.08 --> 538.88
i haven't really talked a lot about it

536.959 --> 541.279
since i self-censored

538.88 --> 543.8389999999999
but i just want to say like yeah i

541.279 --> 546.32
freaking called it and i called it like

543.839 --> 549.6800000000001
nobody out there

546.32 --> 552.399
perhaps bar a couple of like really

549.68 --> 555.12
focused doctors

552.399 --> 557.44
but they yeah doctors always they want

555.12 --> 562.72
to do the full research before they draw

557.44 --> 565.2790000000001
conclusions i do not function that way

562.72 --> 567.76
if i see something and i feel something

565.279 --> 570.56
like this is gonna be it

567.76 --> 573.12
then i call it

570.56 --> 577.1999999999999
and i don't directly back it by evidence

573.12 --> 578.5600000000001
i back it by confidence and well my grip

577.2 --> 582.1600000000001
on my

578.56 --> 582.16
vision experiences also

585.36 --> 591.839
but yeah just wanted to say again like

587.76 --> 591.8389999999999
that stuff is a gift from god

592.0 --> 595.68
and the inventor

594.0 --> 597.04
or the discoverer

595.68 --> 599.279
in japan

597.04 --> 602.16
is a blessed man and he should be

599.279 --> 604.16
probably honored for that

602.16 --> 606.7199999999999
in his country

604.16 --> 609.4399999999999
because it is like he literally received

606.72 --> 612.9590000000001
the gift from god for the world for this

609.44 --> 612.9590000000001
time and beyond

615.279 --> 620.72
right anyway

617.76 --> 620.72
that was on my mind

620.959 --> 624.4799999999999
you think the job is right right for the

623.44 --> 627.44
office

624.48 --> 627.44
what the hell you mean

627.839 --> 633.839
no no keflar no it that it is it that is

631.2 --> 633.839
it

634.72 --> 638.8000000000001
there i

636.32 --> 641.839
like what deep what can you even imagine

638.8 --> 645.4799999999999
anything being worse

641.839 --> 645.48
that would be real

646.56 --> 651.5999999999999
i mean there's like infinite things we

648.72 --> 653.76
can fantasize about that are worse none

651.6 --> 657.399
of those things ever happen though never

653.76 --> 657.399
happens like that

663.519 --> 666.9590000000001
right by the way yeah

667.68 --> 673.3599999999999
the whole

669.44 --> 675.2
it's a boxing joke okay

673.36 --> 678.0
fine

675.2 --> 678.0
rubber digital

684.32 --> 690.9590000000001
right yeah i see it now okay okay fine

688.0 --> 690.959
very distracting

701.2 --> 705.9200000000001
turkish wedding again

703.2 --> 705.9200000000001
or something

708.48 --> 711.48
uh

724.0 --> 729.72
right

725.2 --> 729.72
that's right old house rod born

731.6 --> 737.36
but also i would like to recognize like

734.32 --> 741.36
you all to recognize that

737.36 --> 745.2
the beast system recognizes i

741.36 --> 749.519
the substance horse dewormer for the

745.2 --> 749.519
danger that it poses against it

750.079 --> 757.04
that's why it's being avoided

752.8 --> 759.5999999999999
and being spread fear rumors about like

757.04 --> 761.48
really nothing else out there i mean

759.6 --> 764.0
the other things like

761.48 --> 767.36
hydroxychloroquine and

764.0 --> 767.36
newer things

767.44 --> 771.0400000000001
yeah

768.72 --> 772.399
they are not like on the

771.04 --> 774.639
list of

772.399 --> 775.92
what how you're supposed to respond but

774.639 --> 778.8
i

775.92 --> 780.399
foresty warmer is like

778.8 --> 781.5999999999999
really

780.399 --> 785.44
approached

781.6 --> 787.12
with a higher grade

785.44 --> 789.839
of nervousness

787.12 --> 792.32
and avoidance

789.839 --> 793.36
and the fair rumors about it

792.32 --> 795.12
have been

793.36 --> 797.519
substantial

795.12 --> 799.04
why is that because it is so

797.519 --> 801.68
magnificently

799.04 --> 804.8
efficient and safe

801.68 --> 806.4799999999999
and it does so many more

804.8 --> 809.5999999999999
things than just

806.48 --> 812.76
cure one situation

809.6 --> 812.76
you see

815.44 --> 817.7600000000001
all right

821.36 --> 827.0790000000001
and i think it would be interesting to

823.199 --> 827.079
also find out

828.0 --> 831.92
could

829.68 --> 835.68
regular people make it

831.92 --> 838.959
could they make that substance

835.68 --> 840.8389999999999
like is it doable to fabricate it on the

838.959 --> 844.0
smaller scale in like

840.839 --> 846.32
a an improvised laboratory or is it

844.0 --> 848.959
actually really hazardous to do that or

846.32 --> 850.639
you have to have like large quantities

848.959 --> 852.88
of a whole bunch of things basically a

850.639 --> 854.16
big laboratory to make it

852.88 --> 857.199
i don't know

854.16 --> 858.399
it would be good though

857.199 --> 859.5999999999999
if

858.399 --> 862.48
it was like

859.6 --> 864.88
learned as a personal discipline

862.48 --> 867.279
that like more people in the world could

864.88 --> 867.279
make it

869.279 --> 874.399
so that we're not

870.72 --> 876.24
dependent on the larger pharmaceutical

874.399 --> 879.92
producing companies

876.24 --> 879.92
to fabricate it for us you see

880.48 --> 886.48
yes robert digital

883.36 --> 886.48
that's what i'm talking about

889.36 --> 892.72
what is being said about nothing stone

891.76 --> 895.6
monkey

892.72 --> 898.6
nothing i'm not responding to any recent

895.6 --> 898.6
event

898.959 --> 902.2399999999999
i'm just bringing it up on the table

901.04 --> 904.48
again

902.24 --> 906.5600000000001
for looking and thinking about it's not

904.48 --> 908.88
in response to anything that just

906.56 --> 908.88
happened

910.959 --> 915.1199999999999
it's just that i've been paying

912.16 --> 918.24
attention over the years now since i

915.12 --> 918.24
called it

919.6 --> 922.9590000000001
and

920.56 --> 922.959
yeah

923.199 --> 926.4799999999999
it's really special

925.04 --> 928.8
and it would be great

926.48 --> 929.759
if people

928.8 --> 930.88
like

929.759 --> 933.12
chemists

930.88 --> 935.04
pharmacists could figure out can you

933.12 --> 938.8
actually make that

935.04 --> 938.8
in your garage for example

939.12 --> 944.24
because i don't know i don't know

940.24 --> 944.24
exactly what it is how it's made

944.959 --> 948.2399999999999
it would be great to know

947.04 --> 949.68
can you

948.24 --> 951.6
produce it

949.68 --> 955.04
on an individual level is that a

951.6 --> 957.6
possibility for it

955.04 --> 960.16
might be more news about it no

957.6 --> 961.839
not really except for every time it

960.16 --> 964.639
works

961.839 --> 964.639
and there have been

964.88 --> 968.88
no direct articles but i've been hearing

967.44 --> 971.1990000000001
a lot

968.88 --> 972.639
that people that had like

971.199 --> 976.7199999999999
these

972.639 --> 978.0790000000001
jabs that that got into physical trouble

976.72 --> 979.9200000000001
with it

978.079 --> 983.8389999999999
that taking i

979.92 --> 983.8389999999999
actually neutralized it

984.32 --> 989.839
those might be rumors

986.399 --> 993.759
but it's a weird rumor to make

989.839 --> 993.759
if it's completely not true

994.16 --> 998.7199999999999
there's no such rumors that i've heard

996.16 --> 1000.8
from the other things

998.72 --> 1003.6
from the other solutions

1000.8 --> 1006.7199999999999
which are mainly focused on just getting

1003.6 --> 1009.279
rid of the condition right the cold type

1006.72 --> 1010.58
condition

1009.279 --> 1012.079
and

1010.58 --> 1014.639
[Music]

1012.079 --> 1014.6389999999999
all that

1015.199 --> 1019.4399999999999
none of it has been tested i think

1017.519 --> 1022.079
successfully to

1019.44 --> 1024.4
to treat the conditions that come out of

1022.079 --> 1025.6
out of the jab

1024.4 --> 1028.0
except

1025.6 --> 1030.0
for eye

1028.0 --> 1032.959
horse dewormer which i've

1030.0 --> 1034.72
heard that it actually works

1032.959 --> 1037.1200000000001
on that

1034.72 --> 1040.319
it's more specifically on the the

1037.12 --> 1044.319
graphene influences so

1040.319 --> 1044.319
i might be getting that wrong anyway

1045.199 --> 1049.76
i kind of feel sloppy now not having any

1047.12 --> 1051.12
direct references to that i picked up on

1049.76 --> 1054.16
it here and there

1051.12 --> 1056.0
but i am not like a guy that if i hear

1054.16 --> 1059.6000000000001
something even if it's interesting i

1056.0 --> 1062.96
don't immediately go quickly dig

1059.6 --> 1062.9599999999998
an article or something

1063.36 --> 1067.6789999999999
i just kind of let it hang in my head

1065.919 --> 1068.48
because there's so many different things

1067.679 --> 1072.799
that

1068.48 --> 1075.76
i keep tabs on at the same time

1072.799 --> 1077.12
i can't keep oversight if i try to keep

1075.76 --> 1080.76
oversight

1077.12 --> 1080.76
doing it like that

1095.12 --> 1098.12
right

1108.96 --> 1113.44
huh yes service day was it half a year

1111.6 --> 1115.76
ago i thought i brought it up more than

1113.44 --> 1119.6000000000001
half a year ago

1115.76 --> 1119.6
i'm not sure when it was

1120.32 --> 1126.48
but it was around the time when i also

1123.039 --> 1129.76
got like uh

1126.48 --> 1129.76
timed out by youtube

1130.16 --> 1135.1200000000001
for medical disinformation

1133.2 --> 1137.2
i don't think it was in direct response

1135.12 --> 1138.3999999999999
to talking about that

1137.2 --> 1140.32
but

1138.4 --> 1143.919
it was around that time so yeah that

1140.32 --> 1143.9189999999999
makes sense i think

1144.88 --> 1149.0
it was about half a year ago

1164.08 --> 1167.76
right so that was on my mind

1166.24 --> 1170.08
a bit

1167.76 --> 1171.84
i actually wanted to call the title

1170.08 --> 1173.6
after it but then i thought i'd probably

1171.84 --> 1175.52
get into trouble with youtube if i do

1173.6 --> 1177.12
that

1175.52 --> 1178.6399999999999
and the other one was something that

1177.12 --> 1181.36
came up

1178.64 --> 1184.24
yesterday in my peak about

1181.36 --> 1186.4799999999998
the yeah my criticism on catholic church

1184.24 --> 1189.039
and all that

1186.48 --> 1191.2
and i and i really

1189.039 --> 1193.2
put something together like

1191.2 --> 1195.919
right there that i haven't even thought

1193.2 --> 1197.44
about it like that before and that is

1195.919 --> 1199.919
like the

1197.44 --> 1201.52
what are the actual four horsemen of the

1199.919 --> 1202.64
apocalypse

1201.52 --> 1204.559
because there's

1202.64 --> 1207.679
they have names they have designations

1204.559 --> 1209.6
that we associate typically

1207.679 --> 1212.88
but what if there's another four

1209.6 --> 1215.6789999999999
horsemen of the apocalypse

1212.88 --> 1217.2800000000002
and they've already arrived pretty much

1215.679 --> 1219.679
and we're now at the stage where the

1217.28 --> 1223.28
fourth horseman is

1219.679 --> 1223.2800000000002
is jumping into the fray

1223.44 --> 1227.44
and that would be

1224.96 --> 1229.2
first horseman would be

1227.44 --> 1230.88
the horseman

1229.2 --> 1233.039
to basically

1230.88 --> 1234.4
take the words of christ

1233.039 --> 1237.36
and then write

1234.4 --> 1239.8400000000001
a system around it that makes everybody

1237.36 --> 1241.9189999999999
look at it and ignore his advice

1239.84 --> 1243.6789999999999
which is what modern christianity has

1241.919 --> 1246.24
become

1243.679 --> 1249.8400000000001
right then

1246.24 --> 1252.32
the second horseman which is

1249.84 --> 1254.8799999999999
the horseman of the world

1252.32 --> 1255.76
the the place we live in

1254.88 --> 1258.4
right

1255.76 --> 1261.36
to turn it around turn it turn

1258.4 --> 1264.0
everything inside out and make us forget

1261.36 --> 1266.1589999999999
that god created it

1264.0 --> 1268.72
right that's the globe earth

1266.159 --> 1271.5200000000002
then you have the third horseman

1268.72 --> 1273.3600000000001
which takes our group

1271.52 --> 1277.28
spirit and our

1273.36 --> 1280.08
loyalty sensations and and our tribal

1277.28 --> 1282.0
identity our group identity

1280.08 --> 1284.3999999999999
and then twists its through social

1282.0 --> 1285.6
engineering and psychology

1284.4 --> 1288.64
into

1285.6 --> 1290.7199999999998
communist collective thinking and

1288.64 --> 1293.3600000000001
rejecting of our

1290.72 --> 1294.799
personal spiritual traditions of our

1293.36 --> 1297.76
ancestors

1294.799 --> 1300.08
communism right then the fourth horseman

1297.76 --> 1303.039
is where the actual

1300.08 --> 1304.72
personal body the design from god given

1303.039 --> 1307.12
to us

1304.72 --> 1309.919
is attacked and altered

1307.12 --> 1312.9599999999998
and that's the transhumanism

1309.919 --> 1315.2800000000002
and we're right there right now

1312.96 --> 1317.44
where they're trying that [ __ ] and like

1315.28 --> 1318.799
the jabs are part of that they're

1317.44 --> 1320.0
literally

1318.799 --> 1321.52
admitted

1320.0 --> 1324.88
like changing

1321.52 --> 1324.8799999999999
the way the body functions

1325.12 --> 1329.4399999999998
on purpose experimentally

1328.48 --> 1332.0
right

1329.44 --> 1333.76
so i think that if you address the four

1332.0 --> 1336.32
horsemen

1333.76 --> 1336.32
like that

1336.48 --> 1342.159
then

1338.08 --> 1342.96
it becomes much more intense and direct

1342.159 --> 1344.88
and

1342.96 --> 1347.3600000000001
urgent

1344.88 --> 1349.7600000000002
in your face it's like it's right there

1347.36 --> 1352.9599999999998
it's doing its thing the four horsemen

1349.76 --> 1354.8799999999999
are in the field and they are

1352.96 --> 1356.559
they're running around trampling things

1354.88 --> 1358.72
it's happening right now through other

1356.559 --> 1362.3999999999999
people

1358.72 --> 1364.88
that are that have become part

1362.4 --> 1366.799
of all the deceptions that come from the

1364.88 --> 1368.0
four horsemen

1366.799 --> 1370.08
you see

1368.0 --> 1371.039
everybody's stuck in their own spells

1370.08 --> 1375.6399999999999
all

1371.039 --> 1375.64
coming forth from the four horsemen

1376.559 --> 1379.96
what do you think

1407.52 --> 1413.08
a william cooper book

1410.08 --> 1413.08
really

1420.72 --> 1424.919
oh who's that again

1426.67 --> 1431.3490000000002
[Applause]

1431.6 --> 1434.7199999999998
witch william cooper

1441.2 --> 1445.8400000000001
like milton william cooper

1452.24 --> 1457.559
behold the pill horse is a compliment

1454.559 --> 1457.559
yeah

1461.6 --> 1465.279
oh wait

1463.44 --> 1467.6000000000001
you mean

1465.279 --> 1469.76
william cooper

1467.6 --> 1472.08
read out the part about the four

1469.76 --> 1474.0
horsemen of the apocalypse one time and

1472.08 --> 1479.24
that's like a really good reading i

1474.0 --> 1479.24
think i even remember that myself

1491.44 --> 1496.279
it gets into these topics i bet

1512.08 --> 1517.72
the word clone is deleted on what

1528.32 --> 1531.36
yeah

1529.44 --> 1533.1200000000001
service days team travel is probably

1531.36 --> 1535.36
right because

1533.12 --> 1537.4399999999998
channel owners just think

1535.36 --> 1539.6789999999999
they certain channel owners they're

1537.44 --> 1541.76
really they really get triggered or

1539.679 --> 1543.279
they're sick of certain types of words

1541.76 --> 1545.76
they don't want to discuss it so they

1543.279 --> 1549.36
put it in the

1545.76 --> 1552.08
auto no no list

1549.36 --> 1555.52
there's just like a yeah list that you

1552.08 --> 1557.6789999999999
can insert words in and if anybody uses

1555.52 --> 1560.48
that word in a sentence then it just

1557.679 --> 1565.4
doesn't appear

1560.48 --> 1565.4
so that might be to blame

1588.88 --> 1591.88
right

1600.2 --> 1603.569
[Music]

1611.52 --> 1613.84
right

1624.24 --> 1628.72
freedom of speech is an illusion no it's

1626.48 --> 1628.72
not

1630.08 --> 1634.08
it's still there but freedom of speech

1633.2 --> 1635.76
that's

1634.08 --> 1638.8799999999999
that doesn't mean

1635.76 --> 1640.559
nobody can stop anybody from blabbering

1638.88 --> 1643.0390000000002
whatever the [ __ ] they want in the

1640.559 --> 1645.44
moment right that's not freedom of

1643.039 --> 1645.44
speech

1645.679 --> 1649.44
i mean you could do that in the middle

1647.36 --> 1652.32
of the woods when nobody's there you can

1649.44 --> 1656.799
say whatever the [ __ ] you want

1652.32 --> 1659.4399999999998
no matter how egregious or ridiculous or

1656.799 --> 1661.44
aggressive it is right but if you're

1659.44 --> 1663.8400000000001
with other people

1661.44 --> 1665.279
they will set their limits

1663.84 --> 1667.12
that's not

1665.279 --> 1668.88
censorship

1667.12 --> 1671.52
that's not oh there's no freedom of

1668.88 --> 1672.72
speech no that's called

1671.52 --> 1674.6399999999999
social

1672.72 --> 1676.799
getting about

1674.64 --> 1680.279
everybody has their own limits you have

1676.799 --> 1680.279
to deal with that

1690.159 --> 1695.279
yeah we're being shut up if they don't

1691.679 --> 1698.0
like the truth yeah yeah hello hello

1695.279 --> 1699.12
that is that's not even like freedom of

1698.0 --> 1702.0
speech

1699.12 --> 1702.9599999999998
that's just people that's always been

1702.0 --> 1706.0
people

1702.96 --> 1709.8400000000001
that was people 500 years ago that was

1706.0 --> 1711.76
people 2 000 years ago that's just

1709.84 --> 1714.1589999999999
people

1711.76 --> 1716.8799999999999
has nothing to do with

1714.159 --> 1718.0800000000002
right to freedom of speech that's just

1716.88 --> 1720.96
people

1718.08 --> 1723.279
don't want to wake up they never do

1720.96 --> 1726.0
doesn't really matter where they are

1723.279 --> 1728.08
have a natural resistance to that

1726.0 --> 1731.919
so if you're gonna

1728.08 --> 1735.039
break through you're gonna get friction

1731.919 --> 1737.5200000000002
that's humanity

1735.039 --> 1739.84
people don't like to be forced to wake

1737.52 --> 1739.84
up

1747.36 --> 1752.52
for mayor being shut up what are you

1749.2 --> 1752.52
talking about

1757.919 --> 1764.5590000000002
i don't think so he's been very on

1760.96 --> 1764.559
target with everything he's done

1765.44 --> 1768.88
it's not like he's banned from this the

1767.6 --> 1770.7199999999998
speech floor

1768.88 --> 1774.0
i think that would have happened i i

1770.72 --> 1774.0
would have picked up on that

1774.799 --> 1779.1589999999999
because that would be kind of egregious

1805.679 --> 1809.679
no i don't see it

1807.76 --> 1811.84
i watch every day

1809.679 --> 1813.8400000000001
the mic has been shut down lots of oh

1811.84 --> 1815.279
that

1813.84 --> 1818.1589999999999
yeah yeah

1815.279 --> 1818.159
that is true yeah

1818.399 --> 1823.279
it's not like officially barred or

1820.64 --> 1826.3990000000001
anything it's just manipulated it's just

1823.279 --> 1828.96
[ __ ] around playing games

1826.399 --> 1830.399
entire dutch cabinets playing games they

1828.96 --> 1833.76
should be

1830.399 --> 1833.76
dragged out of the building

1834.64 --> 1840.0800000000002
like you're done here you're not

1836.799 --> 1840.08
supposed to be here anymore

1841.12 --> 1845.6
like you're not even officially elected

1843.6 --> 1848.6
anymore you just need to get the [ __ ]

1845.6 --> 1848.6
out

1858.88 --> 1864.3990000000001
and so they play games they play games

1861.12 --> 1866.7199999999998
to kind of

1864.399 --> 1868.0
make it seem like they still got things

1866.72 --> 1871.2
under control

1868.0 --> 1871.2
it's not working though

1872.559 --> 1877.76
and with not working i mean it's really

1875.12 --> 1880.9599999999998
not working because the situation is

1877.76 --> 1885.72
even getting international attention

1880.96 --> 1885.72
so it's really not working

1907.2 --> 1912.679
what are you talking about

1909.679 --> 1912.679
now

1921.039 --> 1927.44
no my explanation of the four horsemen

1924.96 --> 1931.039
is their ideas

1927.44 --> 1931.039
their spirit they're literally

1931.679 --> 1936.3990000000001
the fallen angel wanting to become god

1934.159 --> 1939.0390000000002
how do you become god

1936.399 --> 1940.8799999999999
by disconnecting every

1939.039 --> 1942.96
connection

1940.88 --> 1945.3600000000001
in creation

1942.96 --> 1949.919
between the human and the god and the

1945.36 --> 1951.6789999999999
four horsemen are every four steps

1949.919 --> 1954.3200000000002
first the connection

1951.679 --> 1955.6000000000001
with christ then the connection with the

1954.32 --> 1957.4399999999998
realm

1955.6 --> 1959.84
then the connection with the group

1957.44 --> 1959.8400000000001
spirit

1959.919 --> 1963.519
and the

1960.84 --> 1966.6399999999999
ancestors and then the connection with

1963.519 --> 1968.799
the very physical body

1966.64 --> 1970.0
design itself

1968.799 --> 1972.72
and those

1970.0 --> 1975.76
they are all the ideas they're the ideas

1972.72 --> 1978.3990000000001
to sever the connection with god

1975.76 --> 1979.44
so they're like

1978.399 --> 1982.08
not

1979.44 --> 1984.3200000000002
destroyers of the world they're this

1982.08 --> 1987.36
they're like the ones that are trying to

1984.32 --> 1989.519
disconnect humanity from god

1987.36 --> 1992.9599999999998
that's what the four horsemen those four

1989.519 --> 1996.3990000000001
horsemen of the apocalypse are to me i

1992.96 --> 1999.279
think they very much

1996.399 --> 2000.7199999999998
trump the original concept of the four

1999.279 --> 2003.84
horsemen

2000.72 --> 2005.84
which is more like a

2003.84 --> 2008.08
little bit of a story based diluted

2005.84 --> 2010.6399999999999
version and it's still very relevant

2008.08 --> 2012.24
because they still express effects that

2010.64 --> 2015.6000000000001
happen

2012.24 --> 2015.6
in times of cataclysm

2016.159 --> 2020.3990000000001
but they're more general right they're

2018.399 --> 2022.799
they're almost like just a part of the

2020.399 --> 2025.12
design also the original four horsemen

2022.799 --> 2026.399
idea it's like that's what happens it's

2025.12 --> 2027.9189999999999
part of the design it's they're

2026.399 --> 2028.7199999999998
basically

2027.919 --> 2030.3990000000001
just

2028.72 --> 2032.24
directed by god

2030.399 --> 2033.84
but the four horsemen that i mentioned

2032.24 --> 2036.48
they are like

2033.84 --> 2040.08
off the fallen angel who wants to take

2036.48 --> 2040.88
over the role of god himself

2040.08 --> 2042.1589999999999
it's

2040.88 --> 2044.96
his

2042.159 --> 2044.96
four horsemen

2045.76 --> 2049.6
and they are much more dangerous

2051.44 --> 2057.04
because cataclysm comes and goes that

2054.399 --> 2060.399
was part of the test of the realm

2057.04 --> 2062.48
but this one severs the connection

2060.399 --> 2065.2
of the human with god

2062.48 --> 2067.76
in all ways and that is

2065.2 --> 2068.6389999999997
has a much more dramatic impact and it

2067.76 --> 2070.96
makes

2068.639 --> 2074.2400000000002
humanity much more prone to being

2070.96 --> 2076.2400000000002
invaded by extra dimensional entities

2074.24 --> 2077.6789999999996
and demons

2076.24 --> 2079.2799999999997
which you can like

2077.679 --> 2080.399
literally

2079.28 --> 2084.32
feel

2080.399 --> 2086.0
palpably around us now for a while

2084.32 --> 2088.2400000000002
on all these fronts

2086.0 --> 2089.839
especially when you confront it right

2088.24 --> 2091.2799999999997
when you confront the lies that's when

2089.839 --> 2092.72
the demons come out that's when they

2091.28 --> 2096.8
show themselves

2092.72 --> 2098.0789999999997
where they are seated within the person

2096.8 --> 2100.4
and so

2098.079 --> 2103.6400000000003
i think that the four horsemen are

2100.4 --> 2103.64
as described

2104.0 --> 2108.48
first one disconnects with christ to

2106.56 --> 2110.7999999999997
form modern christianity which is

2108.48 --> 2113.2
actually anti-christianity

2110.8 --> 2115.119
the second one

2113.2 --> 2117.1189999999997
to turn inside out

2115.119 --> 2119.359
our understanding of creation in the

2117.119 --> 2120.6400000000003
realm the place that we stand in

2119.359 --> 2123.359
and with it

2120.64 --> 2125.839
the respect for god who designed it

2123.359 --> 2127.2799999999997
because it has to be designed

2125.839 --> 2129.2
third one

2127.28 --> 2131.8390000000004
the connection with our community and

2129.2 --> 2131.839
our ancestors

2132.4 --> 2138.64
in creating a social engineering based

2136.079 --> 2141.119
mind control

2138.64 --> 2144.4
governing slave system

2141.119 --> 2146.0
that we roughly know as communism

2144.4 --> 2146.88
although there's even like yeah there's

2146.0 --> 2148.88
a

2146.88 --> 2151.119
more natural communism and then there's

2148.88 --> 2153.2000000000003
like the satanic communism

2151.119 --> 2154.8
and that's the real problem it's the

2153.2 --> 2156.0789999999997
merciless

2154.8 --> 2157.76
greedy

2156.079 --> 2159.76
beast

2157.76 --> 2162.32
and then there's the fourth horseman

2159.76 --> 2164.4
which is the final doom and that is

2162.32 --> 2165.839
transhumanism

2164.4 --> 2168.56
to literally

2165.839 --> 2171.52
re-engineer the conception of what it is

2168.56 --> 2174.32
to be a physical human being

2171.52 --> 2177.2
further degrading

2174.32 --> 2180.4
the the purity of the design

2177.2 --> 2182.3199999999997
given to us by god over the ages and

2180.4 --> 2185.359
it's already

2182.32 --> 2186.7200000000003
naturally through entropy degrading over

2185.359 --> 2189.2799999999997
time

2186.72 --> 2190.72
and transhumanism is going to

2189.28 --> 2193.8390000000004
heavily

2190.72 --> 2195.359
accelerate that dilapidation and

2193.839 --> 2197.68
breakdown

2195.359 --> 2200.16
it's going to destroy

2197.68 --> 2203.3999999999996
right so those are my conception of the

2200.16 --> 2203.3999999999996
four horsemen

2216.32 --> 2219.52
this is the prophecy of the future

2217.839 --> 2220.64
tribulation

2219.52 --> 2222.64
could be

2220.64 --> 2225.04
it's what seems to be happening steamy

2222.64 --> 2228.96
trail this is what i'm figuring out

2225.04 --> 2231.44
and it's been going on for

2228.96 --> 2231.44
a while

2232.88 --> 2236.32
500 years at least

2236.8 --> 2239.6800000000003
so

2237.76 --> 2242.4
the four horsemen are

2239.68 --> 2245.1189999999997
tapping down one by one

2242.4 --> 2246.88
one age at a time

2245.119 --> 2249.76
and they're all staying and they're all

2246.88 --> 2251.44
seating themselves within

2249.76 --> 2254.0
the minds of men

2251.44 --> 2254.0
and women

2255.599 --> 2261.52
they're being accepted

2257.599 --> 2261.52
one by one through conditioning

2262.64 --> 2268.16
over the and i'm talking not just one or

2265.28 --> 2271.1600000000003
two generation i'm talking about like 20

2268.16 --> 2271.16
generations

2271.28 --> 2275.599
this is literally the entry

2274.32 --> 2278.4
of

2275.599 --> 2280.8
of satan

2278.4 --> 2283.52
entering the world to try and take over

2280.8 --> 2285.119
the role of god

2283.52 --> 2288.24
he came in

2285.119 --> 2290.7200000000003
through christianity it's the irony is

2288.24 --> 2290.72
massive

2291.28 --> 2295.119
and then took over

2293.2 --> 2296.7999999999997
piece by piece

2295.119 --> 2300.48
starting with

2296.8 --> 2302.5600000000004
the very connection with christ's wisdom

2300.48 --> 2303.839
then with the world we're standing in

2302.56 --> 2305.839
then with

2303.839 --> 2307.2
our community and the ancestor

2305.839 --> 2310.0789999999997
connections that we have on the

2307.2 --> 2312.72
spiritual level the meaning of our

2310.079 --> 2314.96
existence and the struggle and then

2312.72 --> 2320.16
finally

2314.96 --> 2320.16
yeah the very fabric of our bodies

2324.16 --> 2329.44
the horsemen have physical attribute no

2326.32 --> 2330.8
no these four horsemen are purely

2329.44 --> 2333.599
idea

2330.8 --> 2336.599
their information their

2333.599 --> 2336.599
ideas

2341.119 --> 2345.57
they are purely spiritual

2343.359 --> 2348.729
yeah

2345.57 --> 2348.7290000000003
[Music]

2349.2 --> 2355.2799999999997
i hear that my country

2351.04 --> 2357.2
dropped man yeah i've heard some

2355.28 --> 2359.599
there was actually an article that had

2357.2 --> 2362.16
popped up

2359.599 --> 2363.76
about how

2362.16 --> 2368.0
there might be a

2363.76 --> 2371.599
a truck convoy heading over to belgium

2368.0 --> 2371.599
like they're organizing that

2375.839 --> 2379.599
there was an article

2377.599 --> 2383.2400000000002
that i noticed today

2379.599 --> 2383.2400000000002
let me find it

2390.16 --> 2395.2
right so there's there's word going

2391.839 --> 2395.2
around which is interesting

2395.52 --> 2399.28
right i am

2396.88 --> 2401.52
very skeptical thus far

2399.28 --> 2404.5600000000004
about the whole protest thing well

2401.52 --> 2407.2
yesterday was half of my show i'm very

2404.56 --> 2407.2
skeptical

2408.839 --> 2414.64
but maybe

2411.839 --> 2418.24
maybe this is kind of like a turnaround

2414.64 --> 2418.24
point for the beast itself

2423.04 --> 2428.16
but a turnaround point does not and it

2426.319 --> 2430.319
does not

2428.16 --> 2432.24
mean the end

2430.319 --> 2435.2
it's not the end

2432.24 --> 2436.839
it's a turnaround point as in a

2435.2 --> 2439.839
temporary

2436.839 --> 2443.52
reprieve maybe a bit of

2439.839 --> 2443.52
90s liberals

2444.319 --> 2446.8
a bit like that

2445.76 --> 2450.3190000000004
but

2446.8 --> 2452.7200000000003
it's guaranteed to be temporary only

2450.319 --> 2455.2799999999997
unless it can truly break away from the

2452.72 --> 2457.04
beast unless that old liberal spirit can

2455.28 --> 2460.0
actually break away from the beast

2457.04 --> 2463.119
entirely and and reform

2460.0 --> 2463.119
outside of the beast

2464.16 --> 2468.8799999999997
and not be part of that anymore

2466.96 --> 2471.2
but i don't know if that's even possible

2468.88 --> 2473.359
anymore

2471.2 --> 2477.2799999999997
but at least it's going to be it

2473.359 --> 2477.2799999999997
seems like there's a temporary reprieve

2477.599 --> 2481.92
so yeah maybe the the whole trucker

2479.839 --> 2484.0
thing is going to be the thing

2481.92 --> 2485.76
and then like all the countries might do

2484.0 --> 2488.0
their own trucker

2485.76 --> 2489.6800000000003
it's like a trucker parade

2488.0 --> 2492.0
and it's going around the world and it's

2489.68 --> 2496.24
like everybody's like yeah

2492.0 --> 2498.56
a bit of freedom is it gonna last though

2496.24 --> 2499.5989999999997
how long will it take

2498.56 --> 2502.4
before

2499.599 --> 2504.96
the next situation that's just as bad

2502.4 --> 2509.839
presents itself

2504.96 --> 2509.839
through these crazy government people

2511.04 --> 2514.88
and their

2512.64 --> 2517.359
great reset

2514.88 --> 2518.319
that destroys humanity

2517.359 --> 2520.72
it's like

2518.319 --> 2524.64
that's basically it right the the great

2520.72 --> 2526.9599999999996
reset yeah but the great reset

2524.64 --> 2528.56
destroys humanity

2526.96 --> 2532.16
like they've technically even

2528.56 --> 2534.72
prioritized the destruction of humanity

2532.16 --> 2537.5989999999997
over their own

2534.72 --> 2538.7999999999997
final result welfare

2537.599 --> 2542.88
right

2538.8 --> 2546.2400000000002
so it's not just brutally egotistical

2542.88 --> 2546.2400000000002
no it's literally

2547.48 --> 2554.079
suicidally mad that's the level at where

2551.92 --> 2558.0
these people are with their great reset

2554.079 --> 2560.88
they're like suicidally insane

2558.0 --> 2562.839
they're not even just just brutal ego

2560.88 --> 2566.0
maniacs which is bad enough

2562.839 --> 2568.0789999999997
no because they're not they're they're

2566.0 --> 2571.68
trying to implement things that will

2568.079 --> 2574.5600000000004
literally just destroy

2571.68 --> 2576.96
everything including their wealth

2574.56 --> 2578.7999999999997
the wealth that they steal from people

2576.96 --> 2580.64
to get around right that's how they do

2578.8 --> 2581.92
it well if you're then going to destroy

2580.64 --> 2584.0
all these people who are you going to

2581.92 --> 2587.359
rob your wealth from

2584.0 --> 2591.079
yeah oh is it so important

2587.359 --> 2591.0789999999997
you have to do it anyway

2592.56 --> 2598.0789999999997
it's crazy

2594.48 --> 2598.079
and they're not good just gonna stop

2605.04 --> 2611.96
anyway those

2607.599 --> 2611.96
color zilla see you

2629.52 --> 2632.52
hmm

2639.2 --> 2642.2
hmm

2659.68 --> 2664.24
if you read about neil young yeah it's

2661.599 --> 2664.2400000000002
ridiculous

2665.839 --> 2669.92
like that guy literally sold out

2670.4 --> 2676.119
and he knows it he feels it like he did

2673.119 --> 2676.119
yeah

2679.52 --> 2686.7599999999998
that guy's plunging off the abyss let's

2682.24 --> 2686.7599999999998
see how long the fall is gonna be

2716.48 --> 2719.76
don't have a good feeling about the gone

2718.319 --> 2721.7599999999998
voice

2719.76 --> 2723.6800000000003
well slow mo moon buggy

2721.76 --> 2725.3590000000004
no there's not gonna be any violence or

2723.68 --> 2729.64
anything

2725.359 --> 2729.64
it's just all very costly

2732.88 --> 2736.1600000000003
right

2734.16 --> 2738.319
the trucker protest

2736.16 --> 2741.839
technically if it is about

2738.319 --> 2745.7599999999998
just autonomy and medical autonomy

2741.839 --> 2747.119
it should technically just stay home

2745.76 --> 2751.6800000000003
not spend

2747.119 --> 2754.079
fuel costs right because running a truck

2751.68 --> 2755.44
costs money quite a few

2754.079 --> 2758.5600000000004
right

2755.44 --> 2762.319
so this uh this entire parade thing is

2758.56 --> 2762.319
costly who's gonna pay for all that

2772.4 --> 2775.44
all right but i don't think there's

2773.68 --> 2778.44
gonna be like violence or that kind of

2775.44 --> 2778.44
nonsense

2794.319 --> 2799.68
yeah service day what did you expect

2797.839 --> 2801.839
it

2799.68 --> 2803.839
doesn't work you can't get in there and

2801.839 --> 2805.7599999999998
just say hey flat earth

2803.839 --> 2808.0
duh

2805.76 --> 2810.5600000000004
you know what what you are when you do

2808.0 --> 2813.2
that no matter the reason you're a

2810.56 --> 2813.2
heckler

2813.68 --> 2817.839
because that's not what it's about

2818.4 --> 2823.56
doesn't work like that it's so 2015

2836.0 --> 2840.8
right if you like if you want a tip on

2838.96 --> 2843.839
how to spread

2840.8 --> 2846.079
things like flat earth

2843.839 --> 2848.5589999999997
groups that

2846.079 --> 2851.2000000000003
are not about flat earth right

2848.559 --> 2852.48
here's what you do you don't start

2851.2 --> 2855.68
yapping

2852.48 --> 2857.76
right away especially in moments

2855.68 --> 2860.48
where there's like gatherings and and

2857.76 --> 2862.88
there's like communication loud

2860.48 --> 2865.52
you don't throw it in there that's

2862.88 --> 2868.559
literally called a heckler you disrupt

2865.52 --> 2870.559
what it's actually about no you wait

2868.559 --> 2873.28
till afterward

2870.559 --> 2875.6800000000003
and then you do back room talk or like

2873.28 --> 2877.6800000000003
outside smoke talk

2875.68 --> 2879.839
that's when you bring it up and that's

2877.68 --> 2882.319
how you shred it and that works and then

2879.839 --> 2884.0789999999997
you're not considered a heckler

2882.319 --> 2886.319
you're just considered oh yeah that's a

2884.079 --> 2888.4
guy oh he also had a bit of a weird

2886.319 --> 2890.72
fringe idea that's how they'll

2888.4 --> 2893.2000000000003
communicate it doesn't matter that's the

2890.72 --> 2895.52
way you can actually spread

2893.2 --> 2897.68
that type of information you don't just

2895.52 --> 2899.119
go in the middle of the intense moment

2897.68 --> 2901.52
and start

2899.119 --> 2904.1600000000003
the earth is flat there that's called a

2901.52 --> 2904.16
heckler

2904.319 --> 2908.64
it doesn't matter if it's true it's a

2906.559 --> 2911.3590000000004
it's a heckler

2908.64 --> 2912.4
don't do that i know you like to do that

2911.359 --> 2913.5989999999997
don't

2912.4 --> 2915.04
doesn't work

2913.599 --> 2918.0
you're gonna get kicked out you're gonna

2915.04 --> 2920.319
be recognized as oh there's that heckler

2918.0 --> 2920.319
again

2927.04 --> 2932.4
what new holographic camera

2929.839 --> 2935.04
instantly peeks around off what are you

2932.4 --> 2935.04
talking about

2941.359 --> 2947.839
that's really bizarre steamy traveler

2944.72 --> 2947.839
i've never heard of that

2951.359 --> 2955.24
do you have any link

2983.68 --> 2986.68
hmm

3012.72 --> 3014.8799999999997
ah

3019.52 --> 3022.079
yeah yeah

3020.559 --> 3027.28
no no no no

3022.079 --> 3028.1600000000003
no that's not looking around the corner

3027.28 --> 3032.88
that's

3028.16 --> 3034.64
sneaky now it's basically a it's a

3032.88 --> 3037.52
yeah it's a wave

3034.64 --> 3038.5589999999997
synthetic wave holography so that means

3037.52 --> 3041.28
it's like

3038.559 --> 3043.6800000000003
sending waves

3041.28 --> 3047.2000000000003
and then the response to those waves the

3043.68 --> 3049.52
feedback and then imaging it with the

3047.2 --> 3052.0
data this is like

3049.52 --> 3055.119
macro level

3052.0 --> 3057.52
electron microscope right electron

3055.119 --> 3059.599
microscope sends an electron

3057.52 --> 3062.72
and then its pathway

3059.599 --> 3064.96
goes around the assumed centers of the

3062.72 --> 3066.48
particles that are there

3064.96 --> 3068.88
and then

3066.48 --> 3072.4
it's like digitally the information is

3068.88 --> 3075.839
then mapped into what seems like

3072.4 --> 3078.48
apparent surfaces with molecules and

3075.839 --> 3082.48
like a size it's not literally what it's

3078.48 --> 3084.079
looking at that's calculated out of the

3082.48 --> 3086.64
wavelengths

3084.079 --> 3088.4
so this is just it's a wave scanner it's

3086.64 --> 3090.72
very interesting

3088.4 --> 3094.1600000000003
it's not looking around the corner

3090.72 --> 3094.16
it's looking straight through it

3094.48 --> 3099.04
there's no actual

3096.4 --> 3101.119
bending of light

3099.04 --> 3104.4
going on that's not what this is about

3101.119 --> 3104.4
very interesting though

3107.92 --> 3112.0
it's like a yeah a wavelength deep

3110.24 --> 3114.8799999999997
scanner

3112.0 --> 3116.96
you could say this is like

3114.88 --> 3119.92
spectroscopy in a way

3116.96 --> 3121.839
except more on the surface spectroscopy

3119.92 --> 3123.52
was a failure because

3121.839 --> 3126.48
it required

3123.52 --> 3128.88
to go deep and then it disrupts too much

3126.48 --> 3131.93
but if it's in the short range yeah you

3128.88 --> 3133.119
can literally just scan [ __ ]

3131.93 --> 3134.3999999999996
[Music]

3133.119 --> 3136.2400000000002
and then

3134.4 --> 3137.92
deduce what's there

3136.24 --> 3140.319
through the feedback of the of the

3137.92 --> 3140.319
patterns

3140.4 --> 3143.4
interesting

3159.76 --> 3164.1600000000003
okay theo mega warty hello

3162.079 --> 3167.44
it could be

3164.16 --> 3171.44
look light is a mysterious thing and

3167.44 --> 3171.44
there's like a lot of side light

3172.319 --> 3178.0
in direct light and that can be

3175.92 --> 3179.92
amplified

3178.0 --> 3182.64
in in reading it so yeah there's all

3179.92 --> 3184.96
kinds of things possible i bet

3182.64 --> 3186.7999999999997
but the link that steamy traveler link

3184.96 --> 3190.44
to that's something else that's not

3186.8 --> 3190.44
looking around the corner

3205.839 --> 3212.0
to deal with cult members okay

3208.8 --> 3214.079
i believe you i'm just

3212.0 --> 3217.839
i'm half of my voice one

3214.079 --> 3217.8390000000004
well maybe if you have your own thing

3218.0 --> 3223.0
right

3219.44 --> 3223.0
i was just saying

3223.2 --> 3230.319
people are going to be wary of you

3226.559 --> 3232.7200000000003
if you're going to be very forward

3230.319 --> 3234.88
with the truth and flat earth in the way

3232.72 --> 3237.9199999999996
that you do

3234.88 --> 3240.2400000000002
like in open situations where people are

3237.92 --> 3241.599
gathered and listening to somebody speak

3240.24 --> 3243.68
on the stage

3241.599 --> 3245.119
if you then start to do anything it's

3243.68 --> 3248.5589999999997
going to be

3245.119 --> 3248.559
considered like a heckler

3248.72 --> 3254.0789999999997
because it's very distracting

3251.599 --> 3256.8
but yeah i'll bet you that there's like

3254.079 --> 3259.44
cultists in there there are there are

3256.8 --> 3261.44
many cultists in the netherlands like

3259.44 --> 3263.28
genuine

3261.44 --> 3267.44
cultists

3263.28 --> 3270.1600000000003
people that are like religiously fanatic

3267.44 --> 3274.2400000000002
in reinforcing this [ __ ] they're

3270.16 --> 3274.24
like religious globers religious

3274.559 --> 3280.119
yeah pro-vaxxers

3276.799 --> 3284.24
all kinds of things and they are crazy

3280.119 --> 3284.2400000000002
crazy cultists

3287.119 --> 3293.839
because they act obsessive

3290.559 --> 3293.8390000000004
when you confront them with it

3295.44 --> 3299.88
and there are a lot of them in the

3296.88 --> 3299.88
netherlands

3324.48 --> 3328.72
right the omega word to make sense yeah

3327.2 --> 3331.1189999999997
flashbang

3328.72 --> 3333.7599999999998
and then the light that reflects you can

3331.119 --> 3335.599
basically use the cascading light from

3333.76 --> 3339.5200000000004
the flashbang

3335.599 --> 3339.52
in order to quickly size up

3339.68 --> 3347.96
like a it's like a rough light based

3342.4 --> 3347.96
scan of the vicinity that's interesting

3352.079 --> 3355.079
anyway

3369.04 --> 3372.16
uh service day

3372.4 --> 3375.359
there's

3374.0 --> 3378.319
thousands

3375.359 --> 3380.799
thousands and thousands of dutch people

3378.319 --> 3382.5589999999997
that are obsessed cultists i think that

3380.799 --> 3385.599
they're

3382.559 --> 3385.599
i think they're jews

3386.72 --> 3390.48
or they call themselves that like i met

3389.2 --> 3392.48
people like that

3390.48 --> 3395.68
in school

3392.48 --> 3397.68
like 25 years ago

3395.68 --> 3400.64
that would literally just

3397.68 --> 3404.0
religiously dedicate themselves to

3400.64 --> 3406.8799999999997
reinforcing what they knew technically

3404.0 --> 3406.88
was [ __ ]

3411.44 --> 3416.96
and if i met like several of them as in

3414.24 --> 3419.4399999999996
like 10

3416.96 --> 3422.48
in the school

3419.44 --> 3426.4
in one school can you imagine

3422.48 --> 3428.559
thousands and thousands and thousands of

3426.4 --> 3430.1600000000003
those types of people are around in the

3428.559 --> 3433.1600000000003
netherlands

3430.16 --> 3433.16
thousands

3450.319 --> 3454.319
all right yeah and i basically only

3452.4 --> 3456.64
called them a queue because that's what

3454.319 --> 3458.5589999999997
they called it themselves

3456.64 --> 3461.2799999999997
to me

3458.559 --> 3462.88
when i was still communicating them with

3461.28 --> 3466.6400000000003
them

3462.88 --> 3467.44
from a non-hostile vantage point

3466.64 --> 3469.1189999999997
right

3467.44 --> 3471.119
it's only later that it figured out like

3469.119 --> 3473.04
yeah that really doesn't even have

3471.119 --> 3476.6400000000003
anything to do with jews and their

3473.04 --> 3476.64
religion it's ridiculous

3478.559 --> 3483.6800000000003
so it's the jew that's not a jew

3481.599 --> 3487.6800000000003
it's the self-proclaimed jew that

3483.68 --> 3487.68
doesn't actually follow the religion

3487.839 --> 3492.88
and i think in the netherlands there's

3489.92 --> 3495.799
thousands and thousands of them and they

3492.88 --> 3499.44
are a cult there are

3495.799 --> 3499.81
non-jewish cults that call themselves

3499.44 --> 3501.04
jew

3499.81 --> 3504.0
[Music]

3501.04 --> 3506.4
and that are into

3504.0 --> 3508.88
well reversed world satanic [ __ ] they

3506.4 --> 3510.2400000000002
are basically satanists

3508.88 --> 3514.1600000000003
they probably

3510.24 --> 3514.16
don't consciously realize it though

3514.799 --> 3522.72
so they're like satanic gojim

3519.119 --> 3522.7200000000003
trapped by satan

3523.52 --> 3526.72
it's really freaky

3527.76 --> 3531.28
i used to kind of be in that position

3529.839 --> 3533.359
myself

3531.28 --> 3535.28
until i figured it out

3533.359 --> 3538.88
most of them don't want to figure it out

3535.28 --> 3541.8390000000004
they want to be stuck forever

3538.88 --> 3545.119
it's the hell they chose

3541.839 --> 3549.24
and they stick to that choice

3545.119 --> 3549.2400000000002
and that's why they're so freaky

3560.78 --> 3563.869
[Music]

3566.16 --> 3571.04
so

3567.91 --> 3571.04
[Music]

3579.2 --> 3584.52
yeah sure you can do a shot i don't know

3580.799 --> 3584.52
who that is but

3644.319 --> 3651.319
where did everybody go

3647.359 --> 3651.319
hello by the way gaining wisdom

3687.76 --> 3692.3190000000004
oh

3688.64 --> 3692.319
is the front flat earther

3692.4 --> 3695.599
i know his face maybe

3694.64 --> 3698.64
could be

3695.599 --> 3700.799
look i have not been keeping track of

3698.64 --> 3703.04
the flatter scene in the netherlands at

3700.799 --> 3703.04
all

3703.28 --> 3706.559
like

3704.48 --> 3708.559
if you didn't know i was actually part

3706.559 --> 3711.2000000000003
of the flat earth debates and all that

3708.559 --> 3714.1600000000003
on youtube you probably thought i was a

3711.2 --> 3717.359
baller here

3714.16 --> 3718.96
because i don't know anybody

3717.359 --> 3721.44
i don't know any flat earthers in the

3718.96 --> 3723.28
netherlands really

3721.44 --> 3727.079
it's a handful

3723.28 --> 3727.079
i don't know any streams

3737.92 --> 3742.52
all right kevlar godzilla

3778.0 --> 3783.839
list the names

3780.16 --> 3786.72
okay service day fine if you also send a

3783.839 --> 3786.72
list of links

3787.92 --> 3792.96
of yeah where they actually do things

3791.44 --> 3796.839
make videos

3792.96 --> 3796.839
sure i'll check it out

3797.2 --> 3801.7599999999998
but i have a big suspicion that i'm

3799.119 --> 3804.1600000000003
gonna be like quickly getting this

3801.76 --> 3807.6800000000003
interested because i just i probably

3804.16 --> 3807.68
won't think it's up to date enough

3809.2 --> 3815.359
i'm just like way too much on top with

3812.559 --> 3815.3590000000004
flat earth debate

3817.359 --> 3821.119
i mean

3818.24 --> 3823.52
to be fair flat earth debate is the tip

3821.119 --> 3827.359
of the spear

3823.52 --> 3829.119
flat earth in this realm it is

3827.359 --> 3832.0
it's the most developed the most

3829.119 --> 3834.1600000000003
fine-tuned the most researched

3832.0 --> 3836.88
the most detailed

3834.16 --> 3840.48
there's no no other thing out there that

3836.88 --> 3843.2000000000003
i've come across that actually surpasses

3840.48 --> 3843.2
its quality

3843.839 --> 3849.119
so it's almost like anybody or anything

3846.24 --> 3852.319
out there that tries is going to be like

3849.119 --> 3854.48
yeah that's decent attempt

3852.319 --> 3859.319
but

3854.48 --> 3859.319
right but sure i'll check it out

3872.24 --> 3877.1189999999997
maybe you could use their work for yours

3874.799 --> 3877.119
maybe

3878.319 --> 3882.079
i mean i've always said i've been open

3880.24 --> 3884.9599999999996
for contact

3882.079 --> 3886.7200000000003
right although i'm not media trained so

3884.96 --> 3890.2400000000002
yeah there is gonna be

3886.72 --> 3893.2799999999997
that record of me going all rage win

3890.24 --> 3895.1189999999997
which is kind of no-no for most people

3893.28 --> 3898.88
in the world

3895.119 --> 3900.88
but yeah i am available here i am well

3898.88 --> 3902.88

but he's not like

4053.52 --> 4058.48
he is a he's very much a flat earther

4056.16 --> 4060.48
but he's not like a flat earth streamer

4058.48 --> 4063.68
he's not a flat earth media guy that's

4060.48 --> 4067.76
building his own thing

4063.68 --> 4067.7599999999998
he's a great guy though very awesome

4073.28 --> 4076.28
hmm

4077.5 --> 4080.48
[Music]

4078.64 --> 4081.839
yeah i killed i hope i know him but the

4080.48 --> 4085.28
other two

4081.839 --> 4088.88
yeah doesn't ring a bell

4085.28 --> 4088.88
maybe we've met and i've forgotten

4088.96 --> 4094.0
very active on facebook oh god

4092.24 --> 4096.5599999999995
right

4094.0 --> 4099.839
yeah well i don't have a facebook i'll

4096.56 --> 4099.839000000001
never have facebook

4100.56 --> 4105.719
if it's even still called facebook

4102.719 --> 4105.719
whatever

4111.199 --> 4116.0
the media doesn't do hit pieces on effie

4113.6 --> 4117.759
anymore they used to feel yeah because

4116.0 --> 4120.48
now there's the

4117.759 --> 4121.839
there's the pandemic oh

4120.48 --> 4123.759
right

4121.839 --> 4128.159
like it worked

4123.759 --> 4130.839
the pandemic worked as a massive

4128.159 --> 4133.759
distraction

4130.839 --> 4136.159
right like you can bring up flat earth

4133.759 --> 4137.199
now in general but people are not going

4136.159 --> 4139.599999999999
to be

4137.199 --> 4141.919999999999
as open for it because they're already

4139.6 --> 4143.759
filled up with

4141.92 --> 4144.839
with c and

4143.759 --> 4148.319
jab

4144.839 --> 4150.5599999999995
nonsense they've too much on their mind

4148.319 --> 4153.120000000001
so yeah it worked they don't need to do

4150.56 --> 4156.88
hit pieces because

4153.12 --> 4158.799
people are already too distracted

4156.88 --> 4160.799
but they'll probably get back to it you

4158.799 --> 4163.839
know

4160.799 --> 4164.719
i mean the the whole cronu situation out

4163.839 --> 4167.679
here

4164.719 --> 4169.04
is breaking down heavily it's really

4167.679 --> 4171.4400000000005
crashing

4169.04 --> 4173.679
and that means it they will not be able

4171.44 --> 4176.719
to restart it up like that they have to

4173.679 --> 4178.2390000000005
try something completely different

4176.719 --> 4180.08
that means that

4178.239 --> 4183.12
there's going to be moments of relief

4180.08 --> 4185.44
and then curiosity ops again opens again

4183.12 --> 4187.599999999999
and flat earthers will be there like hey

4185.44 --> 4190.48
we've been here you're ready to learn

4187.6 --> 4192.159000000001
now that's the time when the media

4190.48 --> 4194.32
the beast media

4192.159 --> 4196.08
needs to start making hit pieces again

4194.32 --> 4196.96
to discourage people

4196.08 --> 4199.36
because

4196.96 --> 4200.84
they're no longer distracted by the main

4199.36 --> 4202.5599999999995
event

4200.84 --> 4206.08
see

4202.56 --> 4206.080000000001
so it'll be back don't worry

4208.159 --> 4212.239
literate is just another conspiracy

4210.48 --> 4214.0
theory

4212.239 --> 4216.159
no it's not

4214.0 --> 4218.8
they might call it that it's not just

4216.159 --> 4220.96
that because it's threats and people

4218.8 --> 4222.64
that get into it they don't get out of

4220.96 --> 4226.32
it

4222.64 --> 4229.280000000001
i mean i know that's a very very beloved

4226.32 --> 4231.36
and worshiped rumor that that actually

4229.28 --> 4233.5199999999995
happens that flat earthers

4231.36 --> 4235.36
stop being a flat earther

4233.52 --> 4237.6
but that never

4235.36 --> 4238.96
naturally happens

4237.6 --> 4241.280000000001
it's only

4238.96 --> 4243.36
usually bribe

4241.28 --> 4244.96
conspiracy based

4243.36 --> 4246.96
there's no flat earther that's going to

4244.96 --> 4250.719
say oh it's a globe again without there

4246.96 --> 4252.96
being a really good driving reason to do

4250.719 --> 4252.96
that

4255.679 --> 4258.56
right

4257.679 --> 4260.56
because

4258.56 --> 4262.64
it doesn't happen

4260.56 --> 4265.52
once you figure out flat earth you can't

4262.64 --> 4266.88
un figure out flat earth

4265.52 --> 4269.6
you can still

4266.88 --> 4273.400000000001
ignore it though and just say no i don't

4269.6 --> 4273.400000000001
want to know about that

4273.84 --> 4278.56
but once you know the info

4276.08 --> 4280.239
if you actually start you can't become a

4278.56 --> 4282.400000000001
baller again you see it doesn't work

4280.239 --> 4284.32
like that anymore it's all filled and

4282.4 --> 4286.239
you already received the answers you

4284.32 --> 4288.639999999999
can't keep those answers out of your

4286.239 --> 4290.32
head anymore you've already had them you

4288.64 --> 4293.679
set them

4290.32 --> 4295.92
so then if you want to be acting like

4293.679 --> 4300.0
you're a baller in the ignorance it's

4295.92 --> 4301.12
literally going to fry your brain as you

4300.0 --> 4302.48
do that

4301.12 --> 4306.32
right because you don't have the

4302.48 --> 4308.239
ignorance anymore to protect you

4306.32 --> 4310.639999999999
it's it's going to go to straight out

4308.239 --> 4313.839999999999
lying and that will literally

4310.64 --> 4315.04
fry your brain over time if you keep

4313.84 --> 4315.92
pushing that

4315.04 --> 4318.08
and that

4315.92 --> 4321.84
what do you get out of that

4318.08 --> 4321.84
you get people like sean hawkins

4323.92 --> 4326.64
you get people

4326.84 --> 4331.04
like it's the other creep

4331.52 --> 4337.280000000001
like charles flat earth math

4334.56 --> 4340.080000000001
that's what you you fry they fry their

4337.28 --> 4343.759999999999
brain because they knew

4340.08 --> 4345.6
and then they they ignored it again and

4343.76 --> 4348.0
then they start acting like they're a

4345.6 --> 4350.719
baller again but they know

4348.0 --> 4351.76
so then they lie and when you lie you

4350.719 --> 4354.159
sin

4351.76 --> 4356.400000000001
when you sin you die

4354.159 --> 4359.12
you die a little inside

4356.4 --> 4361.36
literally it literally fries your brain

4359.12 --> 4364.88
you lose your sensibility you lose

4361.36 --> 4368.199
cohesion you lose character cohesion as

4364.88 --> 4368.1990000000005
you do that

4374.64 --> 4378.08
right yeah

4376.0 --> 4380.32
little ranty jose

4378.08 --> 4382.4
well they're toast

4380.32 --> 4383.5199999999995
ranty is a wreck

4382.4 --> 4386.239
jose

4383.52 --> 4389.040000000001
is depleted

4386.239 --> 4391.919999999999
i mean he's still kind of himself but

4389.04 --> 4394.239
jose used to be like really

4391.92 --> 4395.1990000000005
thick spirited and that's a good thing

4394.239 --> 4396.08
as a

4395.199 --> 4400.0
rich

4396.08 --> 4401.679
latino spirit very enthusiastic

4400.0 --> 4402.719
that's how he used to be

4401.679 --> 4405.12
but he's

4402.719 --> 4407.84
since he's turned back he still has some

4405.12 --> 4409.84
of it but he's depleted

4407.84 --> 4413.28
he's not what he used to be

4409.84 --> 4415.4400000000005
it can't be it's too late for that

4413.28 --> 4417.28
ranty it's just a complete wreck

4415.44 --> 4420.879999999999
you can see it it's just literally

4417.28 --> 4420.88
turning into a jab at a hut

4422.8 --> 4426.52
it's not doing good

4436.4 --> 4443.599999999999
i've forgotten more than you know

4440.8 --> 4443.6
is that a saying

4450.8 --> 4453.8
hmm

4459.12 --> 4465.4
classic urbanism yeah you can't unfigure

4461.84 --> 4465.400000000001
out flat earth

4493.36 --> 4497.5199999999995
oh your grandfather used to say it too

4495.44 --> 4502.199

4551.679 --> 4556.08
you

4553.04 --> 4556.08
you're not living there

4556.56 --> 4561.6
you're like the the clown

4559.12 --> 4563.44
dancing outside and sometimes we can

4561.6 --> 4565.76
just open the curtains and look at you

4563.44 --> 4567.28
and like ha ha look at him

4565.76 --> 4569.280000000001

4567.28 --> 4570.5599999999995
inside of the house though

4569.28 --> 4572.8
you know

4570.56 --> 4574.2390000000005
but thanks for dancing there outside in

4572.8 --> 4577.28
front of the window

4574.239 --> 4580.44
for when we feel like watching

4577.28 --> 4580.44
you know

4602.08 --> 4605.08
uh

4628.08 --> 4632.679

4637.199 --> 4640.159
even when you're not here is that why

4639.12 --> 4641.199
you were

4640.159 --> 4644.0
there

4641.199 --> 4647.44
to pick up on when somebody addressed

4644.0 --> 4650.4
you to immediately jump in

4647.44 --> 4652.5599999999995
you were not here were you

4650.4 --> 4654.96
hmm i think you were there you were

4652.56 --> 4656.719
there listening outside and then i

4654.96 --> 4660.08
opened up the curtains and you were

4656.719 --> 4662.4
there dancing like a clown as usual

4660.08 --> 4663.36
because you immediately piped up in the

4662.4 --> 4665.199
chat

4663.36 --> 4667.04
as soon as being mentioned

4665.199 --> 4669.28
right

4667.04 --> 4671.5199999999995
so yeah you are

4669.28 --> 4675.44
living rent free

4671.52 --> 4678.080000000001
outside of our house in the cold

4675.44 --> 4680.799999999999
and you're just choosing to do that and

4678.08 --> 4681.92
saying that ah i'm i am living in your

4680.8 --> 4684.96
house

4681.92 --> 4686.0
like no no you're standing outside of my

4684.96 --> 4688.32
house

4686.0 --> 4690.32
i'm looking at you through my window if

4688.32 --> 4691.199
i'm sick of it i'll close to the curtain

4690.32 --> 4693.44
again

4691.199 --> 4696.32
i'm living in this house and i got the

4693.44 --> 4699.04
key and you're not getting in

4696.32 --> 4701.28
i'm sorry sean

4699.04 --> 4702.32
but if you choose to keep standing there

4701.28 --> 4706.5199999999995
then

4702.32 --> 4706.5199999999995
sure you can stand there

4726.0 --> 4730.36
john your world's best smurf

4742.239 --> 4747.639999999999
i don't know what kind of a smurf would

4744.239 --> 4747.639999999999
sean make

4754.8 --> 4758.52
that's a tough one

4766.76 --> 4771.84
[Music]

4768.56 --> 4774.400000000001
ah yeah good one service day

4771.84 --> 4777.360000000001
maybe he's papa smurf well maybe papa

4774.4 --> 4780.32
smurf when they're on the wrong type of

4777.36 --> 4780.32
mushrooms and

4782.8 --> 4788.719
like i mean if papa smurf basically

4786.719 --> 4790.719
lost the rest of the smurfs

4788.719 --> 4792.2390000000005
well yeah was like kidnapped or

4790.719 --> 4796.159
something ended up somewhere in the

4792.239 --> 4796.159
others on the other side of the world

4796.96 --> 4801.92
and then got all stressed out living

4798.88 --> 4801.92
without the smurfs

4802.239 --> 4806.08
you know

4803.44 --> 4810.159
they would probably go on drugs and then

4806.08 --> 4810.159
he'd end up like sean hawkins kind of

4810.88 --> 4815.96
meth smells

4812.56 --> 4815.96
that's terrible

4819.52 --> 4825.4400000000005
no no i don't want to dishonor the the

4822.48 --> 4829.4
legacy of the smurfs with sean's

4825.44 --> 4829.4
personal life behavior

4840.239 --> 4846.759999999999
oh god science communicator yeah yeah i

4842.8 --> 4846.76
almost forgot that phraseology

4873.28 --> 4877.44
good luck with that service day

4875.679 --> 4878.4
that's not gonna happen anytime soon

4877.44 --> 4882.599999999999
anyway

4878.4 --> 4882.599999999999
two minute break i'll be right back

4948.32 --> 4951.32
so

4963.92 --> 4968.88
ah the sun's coming out again

4966.4 --> 4968.879999999999
awesome

4969.199 --> 4973.5599999999995
oh what a science beautiful

4981.36 --> 4984.639
no don't go away

4984.84 --> 4988.92
son dammit

5015.199 --> 5021.12
hmm yeah lhg yeah watching old movies

5018.48 --> 5023.919999999999
with feis yeah that is

5021.12 --> 5027.159
it's very interesting to do that

5023.92 --> 5027.159
i agree

5032.639 --> 5035.639
so

5062.96 --> 5065.28
hmm

5067.679 --> 5072.96
oh damn at least gee that's that's

5070.48 --> 5072.959999999999
intense

5083.199 --> 5085.839999999999
uh yeah

5089.28 --> 5093.759999999999
i hope you get through that all right

5091.6 --> 5097.52
it's like snow storms and power outages

5093.76 --> 5099.84
are not exactly a great combination

5097.52 --> 5099.84
uh

5115.44 --> 5118.44
hmm

5162.239 --> 5165.718999999999
right anyway

5168.96 --> 5172.4
been going for almost one and a half

5171.12 --> 5175.04
hour

5172.4 --> 5177.199
might be rounding out

5175.04 --> 5180.92
i could go on a little longer if there's

5177.199 --> 5180.919999999999
any more for it

5193.04 --> 5196.04
right

5201.36 --> 5206.12
i don't know who that is flatter sage

5213.92 --> 5220.4800000000005
i can barely keep track of just flat

5216.639 --> 5223.28
earthers that are doing things

5220.48 --> 5227.759999999999
it's really tough for me to

5223.28 --> 5230.48
keep digging into new things like that

5227.76 --> 5233.52
like people that are attempting new

5230.48 --> 5234.959999999999
platforms i find that

5233.52 --> 5237.280000000001
not tedious

5234.96 --> 5240.56
yeah it is kind of tedious not because

5237.28 --> 5242.88
they are tedious it's just because

5240.56 --> 5246.8
been at it for a while

5242.88 --> 5249.92
i've seen so many people come and go

5246.8 --> 5251.679
so many projects start up being very

5249.92 --> 5254.0
promising

5251.679 --> 5257.28
for a while and then kind of like

5254.0 --> 5257.28
dilapidating again

5264.239 --> 5269.599999999999
you threw out a lot of straw man's

5266.96 --> 5269.6
straw men

5275.04 --> 5279.44
measure the ocean floor to get the earth

5279.679 --> 5284.08
that's hilarious

5282.159 --> 5287.12
now the ocean floor is one of the

5284.08 --> 5289.199
straightest longest stretches stretched

5287.12 --> 5291.76
surfaces

5289.199 --> 5291.759999999999
on earth

5292.84 --> 5299.12
flat but i mean there's more refraction

5297.28 --> 5300.8
right there's water

5299.12 --> 5303.04
so if you have a camera there and you

5300.8 --> 5305.6
look oh look the horizon it seems much

5303.04 --> 5310.32
closer yeah because the water is much

5305.6 --> 5312.56
thicker than the air so the apparent

5310.32 --> 5316.08
or like the

5312.56 --> 5316.080000000001
yeah you just not see as far

5321.679 --> 5328.4800000000005
but yeah the no the ocean floors are

5324.88 --> 5328.4800000000005
very very flat

5330.96 --> 5335.12
biggest stretches of flat

5333.36 --> 5336.88
land

5335.12 --> 5340.599999999999
flat dirt

5336.88 --> 5340.6
on earth pretty much

5364.159 --> 5368.0
the xxx i don't know

5372.56 --> 5376.6
i've never heard of that

5403.52 --> 5406.52
fifth

5409.679 --> 5415.159
hey singing star wars by the way to see

5412.159 --> 5415.159
you

5427.84 --> 5432.2390000000005
okay

5429.199 --> 5435.839999999999
it's on david weiss says channel deep

5432.239 --> 5435.839999999999
inside the rabbit hole okay

5439.44 --> 5442.839999999999
let me see

5467.199 --> 5469.759999999999
from when

5470.96 --> 5475.52
david like he decided the rabbit hole

5473.12 --> 5478.639
hasn't had a video upload

5475.52 --> 5478.639
in seven days

5482.08 --> 5487.44
this is like on rockfin or something

5484.639 --> 5489.04
oh kill that priest podcast with karen

5487.44 --> 5491.44
yeah yeah i think i found this from two

5489.04 --> 5494.08
weeks ago

5491.44 --> 5494.08
oh dear

5501.6 --> 5505.84

5552.239 --> 5555.28
are talking about i'm linking it up in

5553.76 --> 5557.04
chat so

5555.28 --> 5561.84
anybody wondering what are you talking

5557.04 --> 5561.84

stream

5591.12 --> 5595.5199999999995
thanks but thanks for linking us up

5598.56 --> 5604.320000000001
it will catapult my show is what why

5605.44 --> 5608.879999999999
like what's that gonna achieve

5615.679 --> 5621.639
it's a smurf talk show yeah that it

5618.0 --> 5621.639
looks like that

5654.639 --> 5658.400000000001
right yeah gaining wisdom well that's

5657.12 --> 5660.719
my personal

5658.4 --> 5662.0
long-term strategy and experience with

5660.719 --> 5664.159
flat earth and how people

5662.0 --> 5665.84
psychologically deal with it

5664.159 --> 5668.4
is that the first thing they need to

5665.84 --> 5668.400000000001
realize

5668.96 --> 5671.199
is

5671.28 --> 5673.84
that

5674.56 --> 5680.0
what they trust in inside of themselves

5677.679 --> 5682.56
is like that's where your worldview is

5680.0 --> 5685.199
it's inside of your mind

5682.56 --> 5686.400000000001
and you start to rely on that as if it

5685.199 --> 5688.48
is universal

5686.4 --> 5690.5599999999995
even though it isn't

5688.48 --> 5692.718999999999
and that if it turns out you were

5690.56 --> 5694.96
completely wrong about things and the

5692.719 --> 5696.88
earth is actually flat and there's many

5694.96 --> 5699.199
unknowns

5696.88 --> 5701.28
that that doesn't technically change

5699.199 --> 5703.44
anything

5701.28 --> 5705.679
except it

5703.44 --> 5707.839999999999
might snap your spirit

5705.679 --> 5709.84
out of where you were

5707.84 --> 5711.4400000000005
sitting

5709.84 --> 5713.84
right but

5711.44 --> 5716.879999999999
you don't have to be afraid that when

5713.84 --> 5719.1990000000005
you go there when you explore other ways

5716.88 --> 5721.04
of approaching

5719.199 --> 5722.96
reality

5721.04 --> 5724.719
in the way that you thought was the only

5722.96 --> 5725.52
way

5724.719 --> 5727.76
that

5725.52 --> 5730.320000000001
that you don't have to be afraid that

5727.76 --> 5732.56
things don't actually change out there

5730.32 --> 5733.599999999999
it still will work the way it has always

5732.56 --> 5735.52
worked

5733.6 --> 5736.96
there's not certainly some imminent

5735.52 --> 5740.4800000000005
threat

5736.96 --> 5742.4
that arises just because you entertain

5740.48 --> 5745.44
an idea

5742.4 --> 5747.759999999999
right to know it's safe it's safe to

5745.44 --> 5749.199
think about this to ponder on it

5747.76 --> 5751.76
that's important

5749.199 --> 5755.04
that's important start out

5751.76 --> 5757.84
that there's no threat that they cannot

5755.04 --> 5760.08
start to perceive flat earthers or the

5757.84 --> 5762.32
idea of flat earth as a threat because

5760.08 --> 5765.04
if if they see it like that

5762.32 --> 5767.84
then they will not listen and they will

5765.04 --> 5770.8
actively keep out any association they

5767.84 --> 5773.360000000001
will become anti-flat earthers

5770.8 --> 5775.119000000001
[Music]

5773.36 --> 5776.799999999999
so it's good to start out like yeah it's

5775.119 --> 5778.799999999999
okay like

5776.8 --> 5782.4800000000005
people are fooled

5778.8 --> 5784.56
it's okay that because everybody to a

5782.48 --> 5786.4
certain extent maybe little kids not so

5784.56 --> 5787.4400000000005
much but you don't confront little kids

5786.4 --> 5789.44
with it

5787.44 --> 5791.04
i'd go 12 years plus

5789.44 --> 5792.5599999999995
right

5791.04 --> 5795.28
they all know

5792.56 --> 5797.76
that people are being fooled out there

5795.28 --> 5800.639
and that a person being fooled

5797.76 --> 5803.4400000000005
can carry that illusion with them for a

5800.639 --> 5805.76
long time and even give it some grand

5803.44 --> 5807.759999999999
purpose

5805.76 --> 5809.679
they'll put it on a sort of a personal

5807.76 --> 5812.4800000000005
pedestal

5809.679 --> 5813.52
for as long as they believe that and

5812.48 --> 5816.959999999999
that

5813.52 --> 5818.8
the world is kind of perpetuated by

5816.96 --> 5820.639
illusions in many ways and that there

5818.8 --> 5822.88
are provable liars starting with

5820.639 --> 5824.08
politicians for example right especially

5822.88 --> 5828.0
right now

5824.08 --> 5830.0
in a time like this a lot of people know

5828.0 --> 5832.639
there's liars there's liars they've

5830.0 --> 5834.719
they've given us this model this idea of

5832.639 --> 5837.36
how it works and we all believed and it

5834.719 --> 5839.28
was all echoed in media and we all went

5837.36 --> 5841.599999999999
with it and it turned out to be a

5839.28 --> 5844.48
complete illusion

5841.6 --> 5847.1990000000005
right well that's a good starting point

5844.48 --> 5849.44
like do you realize that people believe

5847.199 --> 5852.08
illusions people actually can carry

5849.44 --> 5854.32
illusions given to them by liars

5852.08 --> 5855.679
for a very long time and spread it in

5854.32 --> 5857.199
good faith

5855.679 --> 5858.08
thinking that they're spreading the

5857.199 --> 5859.919999999999
truth

5858.08 --> 5862.08
that they're doing it right and that

5859.92 --> 5864.56
that's okay

5862.08 --> 5866.639
right give them that confidence first

5864.56 --> 5870.2390000000005
that's where i start

5866.639 --> 5871.6
and then after they're like oh yeah

5870.239 --> 5874.08
then you start

5871.6 --> 5875.52
with the details like yeah

5874.08 --> 5877.28
so

5875.52 --> 5881.4800000000005
have you ever thought of what the world

5877.28 --> 5881.48
would be like if it was flat

5882.48 --> 5886.32
right

5883.76 --> 5888.2390000000005
don't hand them oh i've seen this and it

5886.32 --> 5891.199
has to be this or the horizon is not

5888.239 --> 5894.879999999999
geometric like your the the defenses

5891.199 --> 5897.199
we've mustered during our our deals with

5894.88 --> 5900.8
anti-flat earthers that's not gonna

5897.199 --> 5902.48
really help awake a newcomer

5900.8 --> 5904.0
let them

5902.48 --> 5905.599999999999
figure it out

5904.0 --> 5907.76
and ask like hey

5905.6 --> 5909.76
if the earth were flat

5907.76 --> 5911.4400000000005
what do you think it's like

5909.76 --> 5914.320000000001
let them like

5911.44 --> 5916.638999999999
see if they can like think of it like oh

5914.32 --> 5918.159
well maybe they'll start to remember

5916.639 --> 5919.28
things that they've seen

5918.159 --> 5921.36
like some

5919.28 --> 5924.719
old depiction from

5921.36 --> 5928.159
an old religion for example or

5924.719 --> 5930.56
or like mandalas from

5928.159 --> 5932.48
buddhist rituals or

5930.56 --> 5934.88
these things right they'll just start to

5932.48 --> 5936.159
like this and that and it'll get them

5934.88 --> 5938.4800000000005
started

5936.159 --> 5941.92
it started thinking about it

5938.48 --> 5944.799999999999
with the confidence that yeah people

5941.92 --> 5946.8
are made to believe nonsense and they

5944.8 --> 5948.56
will really believe that and the world

5946.8 --> 5949.360000000001
is full of that

5948.56 --> 5951.360000000001
so

5949.36 --> 5956.08
you have to kind of start with yourself

5951.36 --> 5956.08
and just think about it think what is it

5956.8 --> 5961.52
what can it be

5959.119 --> 5963.759999999999
right and can you step away from that

5961.52 --> 5965.52
ball because if they're like oh there's

5963.76 --> 5968.2390000000005
got to be ball yeah then they have the

5965.52 --> 5970.56
reflexes right

5968.239 --> 5973.36
baller reflexes from the conditioning

5970.56 --> 5975.76
and then you have to basically tell them

5973.36 --> 5977.839999999999
kind of break it to them easily you know

5975.76 --> 5981.360000000001
ram it in there break it to them easily

5977.84 --> 5982.400000000001
like yeah but it's freely inaudible

5981.36 --> 5984.639
you know

5982.4 --> 5986.638999999999
it really isn't that's

5984.639 --> 5989.04
based on like this mind experiment the

5986.639 --> 5989.84
geometric considerations of the horizon

5989.04 --> 5992.32
and

5989.84 --> 5995.52
like this mathematics

5992.32 --> 5998.719
that assumes the radius value

5995.52 --> 6001.1990000000005
mathematically and then makes

5998.719 --> 6002.639
inserts that in the assertions of how

6001.199 --> 6004.5599999999995
the earth is a ball it's it's

6002.639 --> 6007.679
mathematical trickery

6004.56 --> 6010.159000000001
right it break it carefully

6007.679 --> 6011.92
don't just ram it down a newcomer's

6010.159 --> 6014.0
throat like that you have to break it

6011.92 --> 6015.679
very carefully it's very sensitive

6014.0 --> 6019.6
really

6015.679 --> 6021.119
because it's not nice to

6019.6 --> 6023.04
live your life

6021.119 --> 6024.48
we even realize there's illusions

6023.04 --> 6026.88
there's going to be illusions that i

6024.48 --> 6029.599999999999
believe but still if somebody then just

6026.88 --> 6031.04
force lifts up a veil like that right in

6029.6 --> 6033.76
your face

6031.04 --> 6036.0
it gets very close it hurts you feel

6033.76 --> 6038.4800000000005
ashamed it's like you feel like you've

6036.0 --> 6040.719
been caught in a lie

6038.48 --> 6043.04
even though you didn't even realize it

6040.719 --> 6046.4
was a lie you still feel like you're

6043.04 --> 6047.76
getting caught it's embarrassing

6046.4 --> 6051.28
so you gotta

6047.76 --> 6053.6
take that into account

6051.28 --> 6056.08
they're gonna have a personal reaction

6053.6 --> 6058.639
you gotta break it to them carefully

6056.08 --> 6060.96
subtly and prepare them ahead of time

6058.639 --> 6062.8
like yeah people have illusions people

6060.96 --> 6063.76
believe in lies and

6062.8 --> 6067.119000000001
and can

6063.76 --> 6069.76
carry those lies given to them by liars

6067.119 --> 6071.44
very long believing it's the truth and

6069.76 --> 6074.159000000001
dealing with it

6071.44 --> 6074.159
honestly

6075.28 --> 6079.36
right

6077.199 --> 6082.759999999999
that's that's the most important part to

6079.36 --> 6082.759999999999
start with

6099.52 --> 6103.360000000001
they can't make a complete physical

6101.28 --> 6104.96
model of the solar system yeah that's

6103.36 --> 6108.08
true

6104.96 --> 6110.4
yeah that right because the solar system

6108.08 --> 6111.5199999999995
is basically

6110.4 --> 6114.48
modeled

6111.52 --> 6116.88
with newtonian physics based on the

6114.48 --> 6120.32
original assumption the mass attracts

6116.88 --> 6122.400000000001
mass over distance very weird

6120.32 --> 6125.759999999999
the newtonian concept that he never

6122.4 --> 6128.879999999999
claimed the hypothesis to and then

6125.76 --> 6132.2390000000005
they started to figure out like oh

6128.88 --> 6135.119
wait mercury doesn't work

6132.239 --> 6137.04
in there like they have to leave mercury

6135.119 --> 6139.119
out it's like the whole solar system it

6137.04 --> 6140.56
all works perfectly it all moves the way

6139.119 --> 6142.719
it does

6140.56 --> 6144.719
but they kind of have to take mercury

6142.719 --> 6147.36
out because that doesn't work

6144.719 --> 6150.08
it like if they put mercury in there as

6147.36 --> 6152.4
a newtonian aspect

6150.08 --> 6154.159
everything collapses

6152.4 --> 6157.04
it all collapses

6154.159 --> 6158.799999999999
drastically like boom boom planets bump

6157.04 --> 6162.719
into each other explode

6158.8 --> 6167.04
like inevitably it doesn't work

6162.719 --> 6169.119
right yep mercury keeps appearing there

6167.04 --> 6171.6
every now and then in the sky

6169.119 --> 6174.48
so what they did then is like okay well

6171.6 --> 6176.96
since it is there

6174.48 --> 6180.159
we're just gonna have to like

6176.96 --> 6182.56
put it in there like paint it over so

6180.159 --> 6184.239
that's what they did and they used new

6182.56 --> 6187.119000000001
not newtonian mechanics because that

6184.239 --> 6189.759999999999
didn't work they used einsteinian

6187.119 --> 6193.44
space-time bending gravity which is

6189.76 --> 6193.4400000000005
basically just mathematical

6194.4 --> 6198.638999999999
conception

6195.679 --> 6201.84
like it's not even really a mechanic

6198.639 --> 6204.639
it's just they pasted einstein

6201.84 --> 6206.719
space-time gravity over it and just said

6204.639 --> 6210.56
like this is

6206.719 --> 6213.52
calculated through einstein gravity

6210.56 --> 6215.4400000000005
but they basically only say that because

6213.52 --> 6218.080000000001
they don't want you to know that the

6215.44 --> 6220.719
newtonian model with which the rest of

6218.08 --> 6223.76
the solar system model is calculated

6220.719 --> 6225.679
doesn't apply it it doesn't work they

6223.76 --> 6227.280000000001
just don't want you to know about that

6225.679 --> 6230.32
part it's like an embarrassment the

6227.28 --> 6232.96
whole thing worked except for mercury

6230.32 --> 6235.92
so they say oh that's einstein gravity

6232.96 --> 6237.199
it's only that

6235.92 --> 6239.76
right

6237.199 --> 6242.159
and that's the reality

6239.76 --> 6244.56
of the solar system model it all worked

6242.159 --> 6246.879999999999
except for mercury so they inserted

6244.56 --> 6249.84
einstein gravity just for that but it's

6246.88 --> 6251.6
more like it was just painted over

6249.84 --> 6254.159000000001
afterward right the painting was made

6251.6 --> 6257.4400000000005
then they realized oh [ __ ]

6254.159 --> 6260.159
yeah that mercury doesn't work uh

6257.44 --> 6261.5199999999995
okay just paint over that part you just

6260.159 --> 6263.5199999999995
paint the mercury and say that's

6261.52 --> 6264.96
einstein paint

6263.52 --> 6266.400000000001
that fixes it

6264.96 --> 6268.4800000000005
don't paint it over the rest though

6266.4 --> 6271.28
because then it'll collapse again right

6268.48 --> 6274.919999999999
just the mercury part only there

6271.28 --> 6274.92
and that's what they did

6310.719 --> 6315.56
professor phil bell what where

6319.44 --> 6323.08
oh there he is

6330.239 --> 6333.04
it's

6332.0 --> 6335.119
uh

6333.04 --> 6337.44
professor phil bell will be professor

6335.119 --> 6340.719
phil bell it's it

6337.44 --> 6340.719
he can do what he wants

6341.04 --> 6344.92
we're still gonna have this

6345.84 --> 6351.639
right we're still gonna have the

6347.04 --> 6351.639
conversation the way that we do so

6363.04 --> 6367.5199999999995
i i gotta read it out though it's

6364.48 --> 6369.839999999999
hilarious every navigation textbook and

6367.52 --> 6372.719
every navigation certification course

6369.84 --> 6373.92
refers to the earth as a sphere

6372.719 --> 6376.56
when

6373.92 --> 6378.159
will these be rewritten with flat earth

6376.56 --> 6379.04
references

6378.159 --> 6381.199
no

6379.04 --> 6384.159
you're just wrong they're not

6381.199 --> 6386.5599999999995
referring to the earth as a sphere

6384.159 --> 6389.44
technically i mean they may

6386.56 --> 6391.52
say earth globe

6389.44 --> 6392.96
atmosphere

6391.52 --> 6394.719
uh what is it

6392.96 --> 6396.56
hemisphere they might use the

6394.719 --> 6398.56
phraseologies

6396.56 --> 6401.1990000000005
but when it comes down to the math and

6398.56 --> 6403.6
the actual actions in the geometry

6401.199 --> 6404.799999999999
it doesn't refer to the earth as a

6403.6 --> 6406.400000000001
sphere

6404.8 --> 6408.719
that's your

6406.4 --> 6412.32
wishful projection

6408.719 --> 6415.36
onto it is the part that you fill in

6412.32 --> 6417.199
because you want it to be a sphere it's

6415.36 --> 6419.5199999999995
called wishful thinking

6417.199 --> 6421.28
they don't have to be rewritten with

6419.52 --> 6424.080000000001
flat earth references

6421.28 --> 6426.0
because it's all flat earth

6424.08 --> 6428.4
the actual mechanics the things the

6426.0 --> 6430.0
actions are flat earth

6428.4 --> 6433.199
all of it

6430.0 --> 6434.639
it's just you that refuses to see that

6433.199 --> 6437.28
so you literally

6434.639 --> 6440.400000000001
write your own interpretation version

6437.28 --> 6443.679
inside of your mind over it and then

6440.4 --> 6445.839999999999
assert look but it proved to flat earth

6443.679 --> 6447.76
or i mean it improves the globe

6445.84 --> 6450.56
are you going to rewrite it like a flat

6447.76 --> 6452.96
earth thing no no it doesn't

6450.56 --> 6454.84
insert the globe that's what you think

6452.96 --> 6457.84
it does it doesn't do

6454.84 --> 6460.639
that and every time it's brought onto

6457.84 --> 6462.56
the table for deeper inquiry like on the

6460.639 --> 6465.1990000000005
flat earth debates

6462.56 --> 6466.96
it proves that it doesn't

6465.199 --> 6471.36
assert a globe

6466.96 --> 6474.2390000000005
that's what you say about it

6471.36 --> 6474.239
and it's not true

6482.48 --> 6487.919999999999
professor jeff

6485.6 --> 6487.92
okay

6493.28 --> 6497.36
it would be funny if every

6495.199 --> 6500.879999999999
put prof no that wouldn't be funny at

6497.36 --> 6500.88
all it would be really annoying

6502.639 --> 6507.92
and degrading for actual professors

6505.36 --> 6510.32
people which professors are people that

6507.92 --> 6513.92
are trying to teach everybody

6510.32 --> 6516.159
technically i could say i'm a professor

6513.92 --> 6517.4400000000005
even though i don't have a paper for

6516.159 --> 6521.36
that

6517.44 --> 6521.36
and i'm not media tree

6521.44 --> 6526.799999999999
although i am but i do it my own way i

6524.08 --> 6527.679
media train me the way i like the world

6526.8 --> 6530.56
to be

6527.679 --> 6532.8
not the other way around

6530.56 --> 6535.1990000000005
and it means socially not the shape of

6532.8 --> 6535.1990000000005
the earth

6539.04 --> 6545.76
they all have diagrams of globes

6542.56 --> 6548.639
remove the no they don't need to do that

6545.76 --> 6550.159000000001
because the actual actions that are

6548.639 --> 6553.679
performed

6550.159 --> 6554.799999999999
are all based on flat

6553.679 --> 6557.599
plain

6554.8 --> 6557.599
geometry

6557.76 --> 6561.599
look

6558.639 --> 6564.400000000001
yeah they you look if you want you could

6561.599 --> 6565.4400000000005
erase the globe and then put a flat

6564.4 --> 6566.638999999999
earth

6565.44 --> 6569.28
thing

6566.639 --> 6571.119
in its place if you want it's not really

6569.28 --> 6574.5599999999995
going to change anything right

6571.119 --> 6576.159
a globe in a book like that

6574.56 --> 6579.52
isn't even

6576.159 --> 6582.719
a technical schematic really

6579.52 --> 6584.080000000001
it's only a model it's just a suggestion

6582.719 --> 6587.28
it's there

6584.08 --> 6589.92
for you to feel comforted if you're a

6587.28 --> 6592.239
zealot globe believer

6589.92 --> 6593.84
and you're facing data that proves the

6592.239 --> 6596.239
earth is flat

6593.84 --> 6599.1990000000005
well then it's like oh that hurts oh

6596.239 --> 6600.879999999999
look at the globe oh see oh no they mean

6599.199 --> 6602.719
it to be a globe because it's a globe

6600.88 --> 6605.599
right there oh it's okay

6602.719 --> 6607.679
it's okay the globe's safe oh

6605.599 --> 6609.28
it's okay i don't

6607.679 --> 6612.159
you know

6609.28 --> 6614.32
we know it's a globe

6612.159 --> 6615.36
because it's all calculated on a flat

6614.32 --> 6616.5599999999995
plane

6615.36 --> 6619.199
but because

6616.56 --> 6621.52
there's a globe there that means it must

6619.199 --> 6623.678999999999
be a globe

6621.52 --> 6626.400000000001
right they did it there for your

6623.679 --> 6626.4
protection

6633.36 --> 6638.4
so they yeah they put the globes there

6636.4 --> 6640.239
not even to convince people it is a

6638.4 --> 6643.199
globe they put it there

6640.239 --> 6646.159
to prevent globe zealots from going

6643.199 --> 6648.4
freaking insane all the time

6646.159 --> 6649.36
i'm more convinced now of that

6648.4 --> 6650.96
right

6649.36 --> 6653.36
i don't even think that the globe's

6650.96 --> 6654.96
there anymore to convince us it's a

6653.36 --> 6657.04
globe

6654.96 --> 6660.2390000000005
it's just there to test us

6657.04 --> 6663.36
like are we just gonna not inquire not

6660.239 --> 6666.4
figure out what the reality is

6663.36 --> 6668.239
be a slave be a sheep it's a choice are

6666.4 --> 6670.638999999999
you gonna face the globe and not think

6668.239 --> 6673.36
about whether it's real or not

6670.639 --> 6676.159000000001
or are you so doubling down on your

6673.36 --> 6677.839999999999
globe faith that you literally need a

6676.159 --> 6679.679
globe

6677.84 --> 6681.4400000000005
to comfort you

6679.679 --> 6684.96
to comfort you

6681.44 --> 6687.598999999999
from the actual facing of reality-based

6684.96 --> 6690.56
data which shows you that everything is

6687.599 --> 6693.679
based on flat plane geometry like the

6690.56 --> 6695.76
entire globe model is based on flat

6693.679 --> 6696.88
plane geometry

6695.76 --> 6699.76
all of it

6696.88 --> 6704.2390000000005
the globe model could never have been

6699.76 --> 6706.639
designed if the earth wasn't flat

6704.239 --> 6709.199
yeah so they put globes

6706.639 --> 6711.679
in things in technical books

6709.199 --> 6713.28
to comfort you to prevent you

6711.679 --> 6716.0
from

6713.28 --> 6718.0
yeah from hurting yourself if you're a

6716.0 --> 6721.36
globe zealot

6718.0 --> 6722.719
so when facing the inevitable painful

6721.36 --> 6725.36
data

6722.719 --> 6729.199
that everything only works the way it

6725.36 --> 6729.199
does because the earth is a flat plane

6730.48 --> 6734.959999999999
right when you confront that so you'll

6733.04 --> 6736.48
still have a globe right there to

6734.96 --> 6740.2390000000005
comfort you

6736.48 --> 6740.239
comfort you from the pain

6740.8 --> 6745.4400000000005
of the facts

6742.48 --> 6745.44
that it is flat

6748.8 --> 6752.88
like drawing globes is trickery

6751.199 --> 6755.5199999999995
right well they're

6752.88 --> 6756.88
they're drawing globes as you would give

6755.52 --> 6759.280000000001
a little kid

6756.88 --> 6761.4400000000005
a teddy bear right

6759.28 --> 6762.639
teddy bear is very comforting

6761.44 --> 6765.04
and

6762.639 --> 6767.84
little kids like to love to believe they

6765.04 --> 6770.08
basically imbue a teddy bear with the

6767.84 --> 6771.04
spirit that the body spirit the friend

6770.08 --> 6774.32
spirit

6771.04 --> 6776.08
and that's real right

6774.32 --> 6778.719
but

6776.08 --> 6780.8
they might not know it's not actually a

6778.719 --> 6782.4
living thing it's just a

6780.8 --> 6784.56
a doll

6782.4 --> 6787.5199999999995
in a way

6784.56 --> 6789.280000000001
right but it still helps a lot because

6787.52 --> 6793.84
it makes them feel a lot better it

6789.28 --> 6793.84
comforts them comforts them right

6794.88 --> 6801.52
and that's how they use they put a globe

6796.8 --> 6801.52
in there to soothe your pain

6803.84 --> 6809.599
it's not as not to trick you it's there

6807.36 --> 6812.239
to help you out

6809.599 --> 6814.4800000000005
with your emotional troubles of not

6812.239 --> 6817.638999999999
being able to face that the earth is in

6814.48 --> 6817.638999999999
the globe

6822.96 --> 6828.719
the brain and ball chain wow

6826.159 --> 6831.96
that's that's a really good one slow mo

6828.719 --> 6831.96
moon buggy

6846.54 --> 6852.289
[Music]

6870.0 --> 6873.0
right

6877.04 --> 6880.04
um

6895.199 --> 6898.239
all right i think i'm gonna round out

6896.88 --> 6901.04
the show

6898.239 --> 6901.04
it's been good

6902.4 --> 6906.239
but it's almost two hours and i want to

6904.56 --> 6908.159000000001
get some lunch and gonna get my

6906.239 --> 6912.4
groceries before it

6908.159 --> 6914.719
gets a little dark or rainy or something

6912.4 --> 6914.719
uh

6916.239 --> 6921.28
yeah but it's been a nice show today

6918.88 --> 6925.04
thankfully a lot more calm i i really

6921.28 --> 6926.4
needed that just to have a calm

6925.04 --> 6928.719
show

6926.4 --> 6930.799999999999
yesterday what got so heated

6928.719 --> 6932.56
like almost blew a gasket

6930.8 --> 6934.400000000001
or i kind of did blow a gasket i

6932.56 --> 6935.1990000000005
literally had a headache by the way from

6934.4 --> 6937.119
that

6935.199 --> 6939.919999999999
you know when i get really

6937.119 --> 6941.679
intense it gives me a headache

6939.92 --> 6944.08
afterward

6941.679 --> 6945.4400000000005
and not like a really really bad

6944.08 --> 6947.44
migraine headache when you can't

6945.44 --> 6949.759999999999
concentrate but it's still it's like

6947.44 --> 6952.96
there's like this

6949.76 --> 6954.719
sore thing in there

6952.96 --> 6956.56
when i get that angry

6954.719 --> 6959.36
i don't like that

6956.56 --> 6962.2390000000005
it doesn't feel healthy i mean

6959.36 --> 6964.4
it sure reminds me to not just keep

6962.239 --> 6966.959999999999
pushing that harder and harder because

6964.4 --> 6968.799999999999
it's gonna be unhealthy

6966.96 --> 6971.76
i feel it

6968.8 --> 6973.52
but today's show was very nice and

6971.76 --> 6974.96
so just good conversations about

6973.52 --> 6977.52
different things

6974.96 --> 6978.639
i'm very glad to have been going through

6977.52 --> 6982.56
the

6978.639 --> 6982.56
the my four horsemen concept

6987.76 --> 6991.92
i should title my show

6989.84 --> 6996.71
before i go

6991.92 --> 6996.71
[Applause]

7002.98 --> 7006.209999999999
[Music]

7007.28 --> 7011.08
what should i call it

7019.199 --> 7021.759999999999
hmm

7020.4 --> 7023.04
something with the four horsemen but

7021.76 --> 7025.04
it's not the four horsemen of the

7023.04 --> 7026.96
apocalypse because

7025.04 --> 7028.56
i could call it that but then everybody

7026.96 --> 7030.56
be like hey you're not talking about the

7028.56 --> 7033.119000000001
four horsemen of the apocalypse this is

7030.56 --> 7035.52
your own interpretation so what should i

7033.119 --> 7035.5199999999995
call it

7042.239 --> 7045.839999999999
don't go yet guys

7055.28 --> 7058.398999999999
[Music]

7063.76 --> 7068.719
you could call it like the four horsemen

7065.92 --> 7070.8
of satan but that's like makes it really

7068.719 --> 7073.84
dark

7070.8 --> 7073.84
it is dark though

7079.199 --> 7082.839999999999
can i have some suggestions

7086.239 --> 7090.879999999999
the four horsemen and forgetting more

7088.239 --> 7090.879999999999
than you know

7091.92 --> 7097.32
uh

7093.52 --> 7097.320000000001
now that was you are saying

7106.159 --> 7112.159
what's the opposite of an apocalypse

7109.44 --> 7114.96
because an apocalypse is an unveiling

7112.159 --> 7118.4
but what they were doing is veiling

7114.96 --> 7118.4
so what would be the opposite

7118.48 --> 7121.919999999999
i'm gonna try to google that

7122.08 --> 7129.48
oppo sit

7124.159 --> 7129.48
off a poke lips

7132.4 --> 7135.28
concealment

7139.04 --> 7143.56
obfuscation veiling shrouding

7144.48 --> 7146.799999999999
hmm

7148.56 --> 7152.400000000001
the four shrouded

7152.56 --> 7155.119000000001
horsemen

7155.679 --> 7158.159
yes

7156.639 --> 7160.56
that's what i'm gonna call it that

7158.159 --> 7160.5599999999995
sounds

7160.88 --> 7164.599
straight on target

7176.11 --> 7179.29
[Applause]

7183.52 --> 7186.88
no it's not flirth horseman we were

7185.44 --> 7189.839999999999
talking no

7186.88 --> 7192.96
you don't understand it at all

7189.84 --> 7192.96
hold the house rodborn

7193.44 --> 7200.0
talking about literally the information

7196.96 --> 7201.36
of satan and how it was introduced over

7200.0 --> 7204.8
the ages

7201.36 --> 7206.239
how we were disconnected from god

7204.8 --> 7208.08
and it's not a horseman of the

7206.239 --> 7209.36
apocalypse because the apocalypse are

7208.08 --> 7212.719
revealers so

7209.36 --> 7215.679
the four horsemen of the apocalypse are

7212.719 --> 7216.639
potentially the response

7215.679 --> 7219.679
you see

7216.639 --> 7222.719
not from satan the response from god

7219.679 --> 7222.719
within the design

7222.96 --> 7227.199
but there have been

7225.199 --> 7230.0
the opera there is a reason for them to

7227.199 --> 7232.239
come and yeah what are those

7230.0 --> 7235.28
well i'm calling them now the four

7232.239 --> 7237.678999999999
shrouded horsemen who are actually there

7235.28 --> 7239.759999999999
to veil the truth

7237.679 --> 7243.679
they come from satan

7239.76 --> 7246.719
and they conceal everything from humans

7243.679 --> 7249.28
to make us forget what we are where we

7246.719 --> 7249.28
came from

7249.599 --> 7255.92
what our purpose is

7252.56 --> 7259.599
and god of course above all

7255.92 --> 7262.0
so the four shrouded horsemen it is

7259.599 --> 7264.400000000001
