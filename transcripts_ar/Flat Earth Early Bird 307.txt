37.329 --> 44.239000000000004
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

41.329 --> 45.620000000000005
early-bird number 307 I'm your host

44.239 --> 47.718999999999994
Arwen and before we start the show

45.62 --> 49.669999999999995
please don't forget to share it on any

47.719 --> 50.96
platform you deem fit and also if you

49.67 --> 52.879000000000005

52.879 --> 57.079
when I'm going live which is normally

54.949 --> 59.449
2:00 p.m. Amsterdam time every day

57.079 --> 62.059
please also do support my show through

59.449 --> 66.05
with a paypal patreon my go fund me and

62.059 --> 68.539
my super chats we much appreciate it so

66.05 --> 76.58
yeah today it's kind of nice

68.539 --> 78.289
so my t-shirt again I'll probably put my

76.58 --> 81.40899999999999
sweater back on later in the day because

78.289 --> 85.97
it's not that part still oh yeah and a

81.409 --> 88.22
lot of chemtrails and weirdly enough it

85.97 --> 91.1
was pretty calm at night pretty wind

88.22 --> 95.33
still and clear and the moon was good

91.1 --> 98.20899999999999
very bright and it's just on the roof

95.33 --> 100.91
smoking and looking and there were

98.209 --> 102.349
planes flying over and I said at first I

100.91 --> 105.399
thought hey okay

102.349 --> 107.869
they have like contrails I could see it

105.399 --> 114.16
reflecting in the moon like very weird

107.869 --> 118.369
then it went away so I thought but later

114.16 --> 122.69
like an hour later I actually did see

118.369 --> 124.399
very big chemtrails and that was in the

122.69 --> 127.06
middle of the night there was a two

124.399 --> 127.06
o'clock I think

128.649 --> 131.399
right

132.709 --> 135.849
it's not gonna work

140.36 --> 146.24
all right so yeah chemtrails at night in

143.96 --> 153.47
the middle of the night and chemtrails

146.24 --> 155.84
today as well but yeah it's still ok I

153.47 --> 158.48
guess yes

155.84 --> 162.58
owls last night that's right ha ha thank

158.48 --> 168.70999999999998
you for reminding me I I forgot that was

162.58 --> 170.66000000000003
very bizarre I was just sitting here it

168.71 --> 175.13
was pretty dark outside but moonlight

170.66 --> 178.57999999999998
plenty of moonlight okay and so I heard

175.13 --> 180.709
owl noises around and other birds as

178.58 --> 182.63000000000002
well like they were going back and forth

180.709 --> 189.14000000000001
different types of birds like I get back

182.63 --> 193.43
and woo thing it was just like what wow

189.14 --> 198.25
it's so loud so I was looking and like

193.43 --> 202.37
the owl was visible against the backdrop

198.25 --> 208.22
sitting on that pipe and I could

202.37 --> 212.03
literally see it make it sound as I was

208.22 --> 218.3
staring right at it amazing I just like

212.03 --> 220.34
damn I wish I had yeah I had something

218.3 --> 221.42000000000002
like good camera I could film that that

220.34 --> 225.35
was incredible

221.42 --> 227.86999999999998
and it kept sitting there I think it

225.35 --> 230.06
even seemed kind of like aware I was

227.87 --> 234.19
there and just didn't care that much

230.06 --> 236.9
almost like it wasn't a rush something

234.19 --> 238.88
there was something going on with these

236.9 --> 241.13
birds I don't know who was territorial

238.88 --> 244.28
or that it was just excited about

241.13 --> 246.019
something and expectedly or it was

244.28 --> 248.41
reason or something I don't know what's

246.019 --> 248.41
going on

248.78 --> 252.19
I hope not

254.1 --> 257.27
[Music]

258.12 --> 264.7
yeah I don't like that idea anyway but

262.06 --> 270.13
yeah an hour right in front here pretty

264.7 --> 276.61
incredible uh-huh so let's see who is in

270.13 --> 279.73
chat kind of crowded here yeah oh yeah

276.61 --> 283.69
yeah I'm hearing a lot of cats fighting

279.73 --> 290.14000000000004
as well constantly like in the night and

283.69 --> 295.3
during the daytime anyway yep a GM was

290.14 --> 300.28
first stone monkey 3d Amanda you good

295.3 --> 303.03000000000003
servant Preston Parker bandsaw bandit

at Brendam Nathan Oakley who Steve

317.92 --> 327.49
accidentally band so I invented Aaron

322.93 --> 336.64
maverick what sir others missed skerin

327.49 --> 340.56
be Rupert cow hmm Lu what all right yeah

336.64 --> 340.56
Wolfgang being a total ass

344.439 --> 352.119
I know Aaron maverick if I if I'm 165 I

349.779 --> 354.009
certainly don't feel that smart then

352.119 --> 358.77900000000005
again I might just be smart enough to

354.009 --> 363.719
understand how dumb you still are

358.779 --> 371.649
despite intelligence I don't know anyway

363.719 --> 377.789
righteous force the Me's Kang right Joe

371.649 --> 377.789
hey Jonathan doe doe tree while bill G

378.269 --> 383.559
right I might have doubled some of those

381.639 --> 385.689
names there's a lot of chat activity

383.559 --> 393.53900000000004
going on gently does it

385.689 --> 393.53900000000004
okay oh and who is that

401.46 --> 407.789
yep yes darkstar I'm still looking for a

404.919 --> 407.789
job that's right

409.949 --> 426.939
Lottie says no winter is coming right

417.879 --> 430.719
yeah it kind of is isn't it star ecig

426.939 --> 432.819
dust you know that's the kind of comment

430.719 --> 436.27
that I would typically ban you for but

432.819 --> 442.22900000000004
in this case it's kind of self it is

436.27 --> 442.229
ridiculous enough to be funny so

449.97 --> 453.559
[Music]

460.949 --> 470.55
I'm just well I don't think they're

466.05 --> 473.249
gonna give me a a what is it they show

470.55 --> 475.62
first pay for that really so that's not

473.249 --> 478.16900000000004
that wouldn't be much of a job really as

475.62 --> 481.58
in a job that I'm looking for it's not

478.169 --> 481.58
like I don't have anything to do

483.919 --> 493.19899999999996
completely forgotten by the way I got to

485.939 --> 497.87
Mara coffee and tea that's it or rather

493.199 --> 500.93
I had to Mara coffee it was good

497.87 --> 500.93
[Music]

515.15 --> 518.4399999999999
very my from where

523.529 --> 532.06
no no you you know the thing about

529.23 --> 535.12
trolling is that without actual

532.06 --> 539.7399999999999
creativity or progress it's just gonna

535.12 --> 544.75
wear out its energy so it's gonna be to

539.74 --> 553.54
me just really tiresome and much easier

544.75 --> 555.82
to ignore so yeah yeah the well I don't

553.54 --> 559.4699999999999
really care you know I have other

555.82 --> 559.47
priorities right now dark sir

570.54 --> 577.4499999999999
all right there were some interesting

573.67 --> 584.4399999999999
things by the way that came across this

577.45 --> 587.5600000000001
morning this part yeah this morning yeah

584.44 --> 592.21
you know every time Randy's on these

587.56 --> 594.67
crazy shows it's I I tend to kind of

592.21 --> 595.24
hang on pretty late as well it's not

594.67 --> 599.4699999999999
good

595.24 --> 601.99
shouldn't do that not very helpful that

599.47 --> 604.4200000000001
right when I actually am trying to seek

601.99 --> 606.79
a job that I'm gonna change my rhythm to

604.42 --> 614.62
the night that's just so typical so I

606.79 --> 621.75
can't do that it was pretty yeah it's

614.62 --> 621.75
just it was crazy

624.01 --> 633.22
I don't know what what he's doing is

627.04 --> 634.39
just so weird at this point anyway yeah

633.22 --> 636.25
man

634.39 --> 640.08
I was watching Owen Benjamin and

636.25 --> 643.14
somebody sent him a grappler mask and

640.08 --> 648.5500000000001
literally when he put that thing on and

643.14 --> 650.59
did his thing I just I almost literally

648.55 --> 653.68
rolled on the floor laughing that was so

650.59 --> 657.48
freaking hilarious because the mask

653.68 --> 664.56
looks really good it looks really real

657.48 --> 664.5600000000001
let me show it I got it freeze framed

668.46 --> 676.75
look yeah pretty creepy but it's derived

671.86 --> 680.35
from the original drawing made from the

676.75 --> 682.38
grappler sketch of the onion which is

680.35 --> 688.15
where the whole grappler and blÃ¤ttler

682.38 --> 693.55
comes from specifically yeah and then

688.15 --> 701.76
you can guess it he says with next gen Z

693.55 --> 701.76
with that mask on so yeah it was amazing

704.9 --> 709.76
yeah it was kind of funny because in a

707.63 --> 712.1
way he's been saying that a lot and it

709.76 --> 714.29
is funny but yeah eventually it kind of

712.1 --> 717.74
wears out but then he bet he got that

714.29 --> 724.43
mask and just brought it to the new

717.74 --> 726.46
level it's perfect timing anyway that

724.43 --> 730.87
was that

726.46 --> 734.1600000000001
and then there was a well a kind of at

730.87 --> 739.87
least at first seemingly interesting

734.16 --> 742.51
article I found in one of the was the

739.87 --> 746.13
Dutch alternative media lines that I

742.51 --> 751.209
follow from the National Geographic

746.13 --> 754.0889999999999
apparently some some people in the

751.209 --> 757.63
geology University of Utrecht and which

754.089 --> 760.36
is hilarious because in retrospect one

757.63 --> 762.9399999999999
of the guys that was my direct neighbor

760.36 --> 765.49
that I had been talking to who who was

762.94 --> 767.6800000000001
studying geology might have been

765.49 --> 771.399
involved in some way now probably not

767.68 --> 773.41
but he might have had word of it anyway

771.399 --> 775.72
people here have been doing some pretty

773.41 --> 778.35
wide research and there was an article

775.72 --> 782.11
but it's all in Dutch it's pretty big

778.35 --> 786.3000000000001
where they did a lot of research as to

782.11 --> 788.89
how the tectonics have changed

786.3 --> 790.54
supposedly over 250 million years

788.89 --> 794.529
according to them Europe around

790.54 --> 797.89
especially the south and they modeled it

794.529 --> 801.3389999999999
with a certain program but yeah as you

797.89 --> 802.779
can all expect it's geocentric base but

801.339 --> 806.22
still yeah there is something

802.779 --> 811.39
interesting to tectonics and there look

806.22 --> 813.4590000000001
how did the shifts happen you know they

811.39 --> 816.64
have an explanation supposedly it all

813.459 --> 819.31
drifting on the molten bowl and going

816.64 --> 823.36
underneath in into the molten iron core

819.31 --> 825.16
melting up and all that I don't know but

823.36 --> 828.48
there seems to be some kind of shifts

825.16 --> 828.48
going on at least and

830.57 --> 835.82
I don't know I thought it it was

832.85 --> 842.75
interesting you know it's geology is a

835.82 --> 846.38
is a a kind of tough and weird science

842.75 --> 848.45
even that yeah it's not actually even a

846.38 --> 851.38
science but they kind of gather it with

848.45 --> 854.63
the colloquial sciences as it were and

851.38 --> 857.21
but yeah they do do a lot of field

854.63 --> 860.57
research and that is kind of interesting

857.21 --> 863.08
that like they gather data a lot and

860.57 --> 867.59
manage it and that's kind of interesting

863.08 --> 871.85
but then they are guided basically by

867.59 --> 874.25
the globe religion drunk inclusions from

871.85 --> 878.12
all that and that is really where it

874.25 --> 884.39
gets really really shitty if you know

878.12 --> 887.63
what I mean whoo right but still I am

884.39 --> 892.01
fascinated by the actual scans that they

887.63 --> 896.24
do and just knowing about what is in

892.01 --> 900.23
there well what are rocks even comprised

896.24 --> 904.09
of how does that work where the metallic

900.23 --> 907.36
parts and just because it is so complex

904.09 --> 911.51
what rocks and everything in the world

907.36 --> 913.52
the nonliving world even is and that's

911.51 --> 915.65
why I still like it it's just that they

913.52 --> 919.04
always have to turn it into that stupid

915.65 --> 924.74
ball in their conclusions

919.04 --> 932.2099999999999
I think geology would probably make a

924.74 --> 934.8100000000001
lot more sense if if yeah if the

932.21 --> 941.0300000000001
spinning ball would topple as the of

934.81 --> 943.51
Imperial official religion start to make

941.03 --> 943.51
a lot more sense

945.07 --> 951.13
and it would be more groundbreaking

948.759 --> 952.87
because it is literally discovering

951.13 --> 956.56
something that you don't really know

952.87 --> 958.8100000000001
that it is really a big mystery as to

956.56 --> 960.91
what is it or what is really down there

958.81 --> 965.829
and yeah

960.91 --> 968.199
anyway yeah this article I'll link you

965.829 --> 975.0089999999999
up it's in the National Geographic I

968.199 --> 977.43
don't maybe could be translated to no no

975.009 --> 977.4300000000001
it can't

981.28 --> 984.51
that's too bad

985.81 --> 998.63
wait maybe I spoke too soon now now this

994.46 --> 1001.26
seems to be complete touch Division of

998.63 --> 1001.26
National Geographic

1012.42 --> 1018.24
right well yeah sleeping warriors right

1015.81 --> 1021.18
it's not really a science but what

1018.24 --> 1025.169
geology does basically entail is data

1021.18 --> 1028.11
gathering and the data is still the data

1025.169 --> 1031.949
says just like medical data gathering is

1028.11 --> 1036.75
still medical data whatever conclusions

1031.949 --> 1038.8500000000001
you draw from them so and yeah what the

1036.75 --> 1042.0
conclusions that they do tend to draw

1038.85 --> 1046.3799999999999
what they uphold is totals pseudoscience

1042.0 --> 1048.27
nonsense or based on globe religion most

1046.38 --> 1050.64
of it not all of it if it even

1048.27 --> 1052.559
encompasses the entire world sometimes

1050.64 --> 1055.169
it just doesn't even get involved and

1052.559 --> 1057.02
that's just something locally figuring

1055.169 --> 1059.69
out what's going on how is it moving

1057.02 --> 1064.1689999999999
what happened that's it

1059.69 --> 1067.29
real real smart your geologist will

1064.169 --> 1072.1100000000001
probably try to keep it local don't get

1067.29 --> 1072.11
involved in the whole globe aspect of it

1083.49 --> 1086.49
what

1086.56 --> 1093.33
[Music]

1088.41 --> 1096.5500000000002
are you what covering desert landscapes

1093.33 --> 1098.9299999999998
with aluminum are you insane

1096.55 --> 1104.01
[Music]

1098.93 --> 1106.47
you know how that's gonna have a a total

1104.01 --> 1108.9
genocide of effect on the nature you

1106.47 --> 1110.73
know yeah you think the desert it's all

1108.9 --> 1114.5700000000002
sand right you think there's nothing in

1110.73 --> 1116.82
long you know how much life there is in

1114.57 --> 1120.6299999999999
the desert you know how dependent it is

1116.82 --> 1123.78
on the morning dew to survive if you're

1120.63 --> 1125.4
gonna freakin put aluminum foil

1123.78 --> 1128.8799999999999
everywhere you know what that's gonna do

1125.4 --> 1134.25
is gonna kill everything it's totally

1128.88 --> 1136.23
insane totally insane for and not even

1134.25 --> 1140.03
speaking about the reason why you would

1136.23 --> 1145.49
supposedly do that besides being insane

1140.03 --> 1145.49
poof no

1150.53 --> 1164.21
no it's not our job to try to alter

1160.93 --> 1166.55
whatever direction the atmosphere is

1164.21 --> 1169.1000000000001
going at there are simply there's one

1166.55 --> 1170.8999999999999
cycle we can concern ourselves with if

1169.1 --> 1174.02
we do a right than it actually is

1170.9 --> 1177.0500000000002
productive and that is the co2 oxygen

1174.02 --> 1181.42
cycle this is critical to all life so

1177.05 --> 1184.51
just ensure that there is enough co2

1181.42 --> 1188.51
enough plants to transform into oxygen

1184.51 --> 1191.42
keep focus on that very strict it's

1188.51 --> 1194.86
literally like the lungs of the entire

1191.42 --> 1198.88
organism of the entire world just don't

1194.86 --> 1202.4299999999998
break the rules don't turn the earth as

1198.88 --> 1204.23
asthmatic as it were and things will

1202.43 --> 1206.39
work out because that's what's gonna

1204.23 --> 1208.67
happen if you try to crack down on that

1206.39 --> 1211.8200000000002
cycle and some way if you reduce any of

1208.67 --> 1215.0
the factors the amount of plants versus

1211.82 --> 1218.06
the amount of co2 produced or the amount

1215.0 --> 1220.04
of all of it it's not properly in

1218.06 --> 1221.57
balance yeah you're gonna be screwed at

1220.04 --> 1227.0
some point the earth is going to turn

1221.57 --> 1230.51
asthmatic all of it so that's a good way

1227.0 --> 1234.2
to focus on that yeah trying to alter

1230.51 --> 1237.41
the way the heavenly bodies the Sun or

1234.2 --> 1239.45
whatever is going to change the interact

1237.41 --> 1243.7900000000002
with the surface that just seems not

1239.45 --> 1243.79
very smart thing to do

1245.21 --> 1252.2
right plankton and algae weigh produce

1247.91 --> 1255.1100000000001
way more oxygen than plants that's cool

1252.2 --> 1258.29
yeah well I have suggested literally

1255.11 --> 1260.4799999999998
multiple times and I can say at it over

1258.29 --> 1262.85
10 years ago I brought this into

1260.48 --> 1265.55
political people that are involved in

1262.85 --> 1267.23
political circles which I thought were

1265.55 --> 1268.76
kind of good from the pirate party here

1267.23 --> 1273.6200000000001
I even said it like yeah

1268.76 --> 1277.52
algae generators like big towers the

1273.62 --> 1280.25
giant water cycle algae that literally

1277.52 --> 1284.8899999999999
kind of filter out the co2 of the direct

1280.25 --> 1288.47
environment or combination of gases

1284.89 --> 1291.3200000000002
pumping through it actively so it's like

1288.47 --> 1294.3700000000001
pressurized lungs almost for these algae

1291.32 --> 1298.1599999999999
start producing then when they over grow

1294.37 --> 1300.26
just scoop it out replace it and yeah

1298.16 --> 1302.66
you can even use that product for

1300.26 --> 1306.01
something you yeah if you kind of

1302.66 --> 1309.23
managed to combine the type of algae

1306.01 --> 1313.4
producing oxygen with the algae actually

1309.23 --> 1316.15
being nourish more nourishing then yeah

1313.4 --> 1320.21
you have a super win-win-win situation

1316.15 --> 1323.39
products can literally create oxygen and

1320.21 --> 1325.3700000000001
nutrients at the same time so yeah that

1323.39 --> 1327.74
would be an ideal I don't know if that

1325.37 --> 1332.1499999999999
could be attained at some point but

1327.74 --> 1333.85
that's gonna be such a huge game-changer

1332.15 --> 1337.7900000000002
[Music]

1333.85 --> 1340.1899999999998
because it is just pure Plenty all of it

1337.79 --> 1343.93
there's yeah there's you just need a few

1340.19 --> 1347.06
samples of the of that type of algae

1343.93 --> 1350.63
managed to keep it alive and you could

1347.06 --> 1352.22
just spawn these algae centered

1350.63 --> 1353.8400000000001
everywhere make everyone healthy and

1352.22 --> 1356.69
increase the amount of oxygen at the

1353.84 --> 1358.6399999999999
same time it's crazy but yeah that could

1356.69 --> 1362.02
be in the that's probably gonna take a

1358.64 --> 1364.5200000000002
while to develop you know you got a

1362.02 --> 1366.8899999999999
crossbreed the algae or Howdy's that

1364.52 --> 1369.55
crossbreed it's just like let them now

1366.89 --> 1374.3000000000002
naturally alter to work the direction

1369.55 --> 1378.05
you wanted this yeah the the species to

1374.3 --> 1380.1499999999999
be in order to attain the perfect

1378.05 --> 1382.57
balanced effect for what you're gonna

1380.15 --> 1385.8200000000002
use it for in the product

1382.57 --> 1387.35
anyway I'm giving up way too much advice

1385.82 --> 1392.1499999999999
here I should have probably not done

1387.35 --> 1394.28
that kept it to myself but anyway if I

1392.15 --> 1397.13
kept it to myself and probably half way

1394.28 --> 1399.68
building it I would have had like ten

1397.13 --> 1401.18
Mecca globalist competitors anyway I

1399.68 --> 1406.22
don't know they're probably already

1401.18 --> 1411.1100000000001
doing this really anyway yeah that would

1406.22 --> 1418.43
be a good way yeah right all kinds of

1411.11 --> 1423.2199999999998
foods algae and I've even suggested go

1418.43 --> 1423.22
further with it and expand the amount of

1428.38 --> 1436.2700000000002
clean up the rivers and use them all as

1432.24 --> 1440.559
viable living fishing grounds like

1436.27 --> 1443.8899999999999
really you can do that just perfect the

1440.559 --> 1445.539
filtration of all the whatever toxic

1443.89 --> 1447.76
crap is going to be dumped in that River

1445.539 --> 1451.87
because yeah you can never completely

1447.76 --> 1455.5
prevent [Â __Â ] from besides yet actual

1451.87 --> 1457.84
toxic stuff from getting in there so

1455.5 --> 1460.6
just perfect the filtration of it

1457.84 --> 1463.99
somehow and then managed to clean up the

1460.6 --> 1466.8999999999999
rivers like with a kidney system clean

1463.99 --> 1469.179
it out and then eject the pure toxic

1466.9 --> 1472.3600000000001
garbage that could that be contained and

1469.179 --> 1473.679
stored somewhere until further notice at

1472.36 --> 1476.26
least it's not going to be in a river

1473.679 --> 1478.48
and it's not gonna be dumped into the

1476.26 --> 1479.919
ocean as well so that's gonna the oceans

1478.48 --> 1481.75
going to be happy with that if we get

1479.919 --> 1484.8700000000001
that done and then you can use all these

1481.75 --> 1486.549
rivers to just actively breed fish

1484.87 --> 1488.6499999999999
whatever type of fish you like and then

1486.549 --> 1491.08
the people could potentially go fishing

1488.65 --> 1496.179
and actually eat it and not get sick how

1491.08 --> 1499.12
about that or well there's a big chance

1496.179 --> 1501.64
in circumstances that just companies

1499.12 --> 1504.6
will kind of like start to try to

1501.64 --> 1508.659
utilize their rivers more with active

1504.6 --> 1510.6299999999999
breeding fisheries and have local fish

1508.659 --> 1514.0300000000002
production really healthy and really

1510.63 --> 1516.94
cheap and independent relatively so

1514.03 --> 1520.539
that's that should be everywhere in my

1516.94 --> 1523.15
opinion that's how you really change the

1520.539 --> 1525.6589999999999
world around how you create new industry

1523.15 --> 1531.19
industries that are self-sufficient and

1525.659 --> 1534.13
efficient and how you can actually solve

1531.19 --> 1537.28
problems without having to change the

1534.13 --> 1540.0100000000002
entire freakin world before you can even

1537.28 --> 1541.9289999999999
make the first few actual steps for the

1540.01 --> 1542.89
plan you're trying to achieve because

1541.929 --> 1546.69
that never works

1542.89 --> 1549.97
you just gotta fix it yourself always so

1546.69 --> 1552.76
toxic filtration out of rivers get the

1549.97 --> 1556.799
real dangerous crap keep it out of there

1552.76 --> 1560.84
or filter it out through filtering

1556.799 --> 1564.289
large-scale systems like a a giant

1560.84 --> 1566.629
thing in between the river that can go

1564.289 --> 1569.99
at a relatively rapid pace that could

1566.629 --> 1572.139
efficiently filter it out without using

1569.99 --> 1574.57
filters that get stuck and just

1572.139 --> 1578.9599999999998
naturally push the crap

1574.57 --> 1581.539
they gather toxins out of there and I

1578.96 --> 1584.509
this idea is inspired by the kidneys

1581.539 --> 1586.249
that does this like this if the kidneys

1584.509 --> 1588.289
don't get clogged the kidneys go

1586.249 --> 1592.46
full-speed they filter it out and then

1588.289 --> 1596.21
the toxins are separately dumped and I

1592.46 --> 1599.6000000000001
want to use the inspiration of the

1596.21 --> 1602.299
kidney to figure out how to do this on a

1599.6 --> 1605.389
river scale and then who knows you could

1602.299 --> 1608.269
apply that kind of system for a lot of

1605.389 --> 1614.84
things but it would be preferable if it

1608.269 --> 1618.47
was purely a non-electronic if possible

1614.84 --> 1620.779
or maybe sensory backup things but that

1618.47 --> 1624.1390000000001
the very function of it would not be

1620.779 --> 1626.869
dependent on electronics and with the

1624.139 --> 1629.809
least amount of gears as possible so it

1626.869 --> 1632.119
would if just the pure dynamic shape of

1629.809 --> 1635.09
it and the natural pressure of the river

1632.119 --> 1636.73
would cause the whole process to propel

1635.09 --> 1640.279
itself that would be ideal

1636.73 --> 1644.679
just like the kitties so that is where I

1640.279 --> 1647.899
get my design inspirations yeah this is

1644.679 --> 1651.2
okay just so you realize this is kind of

1647.899 --> 1653.33
the thing that I would really like to do

1651.2 --> 1658.3990000000001
and I probably I would have had the

1653.33 --> 1660.529
chance if I did if I could have just

1658.399 --> 1664.2199999999998
made up my mind early in my life and

1660.529 --> 1667.429
actually gotten to sensible life

1664.22 --> 1669.619
perspective but now it's just ideas and

1667.429 --> 1673.419
who knows if it's ever gonna happen I'm

1669.619 --> 1673.4189999999999
just throwing it out there at this point

1684.51 --> 1691.02
planting read oh right yeah beside this

1687.82 --> 1693.27
mechanical kidney system that I am

1691.02 --> 1695.86
trying to think up how that could work

1693.27 --> 1700.33
maybe it's already out there on some

1695.86 --> 1702.9099999999999
skill I know that the Chinese utilize

1700.33 --> 1705.01
air filtration systems that are very

1702.91 --> 1707.26
similar to this concept but what they do

1705.01 --> 1709.48
is they filter it out and then the

1707.26 --> 1712.9
filter which yeah does use the eyes

1709.48 --> 1718.27
pressure differential then automatically

1712.9 --> 1720.73
pushes out the dust like bricks so it's

1718.27 --> 1723.07
also kind of fair yeah the idea should

1720.73 --> 1726.1
be very similar to that but with water

1723.07 --> 1729.25
instead of air and preferably not

1726.1 --> 1731.82
dependent on electronics because if it

1729.25 --> 1735.88
would get stuck then yeah there could be

1731.82 --> 1738.52
water issues floods in that [Â __Â ] so that

1735.88 --> 1741.22
it can air it must not get be able to

1738.52 --> 1751.99
get stuck because of electronic failures

1741.22 --> 1758.46
were yeah yeah music man that's another

1751.99 --> 1758.46
issue the pesticides yeah

1759.13 --> 1764.47
but then again pesticides can kind of be

1762.16 --> 1767.919
filtered it is already achievable it's

1764.47 --> 1771.97
just not achievable at high pressures

1767.919 --> 1774.5200000000002
yet without draining a lot of without

1771.97 --> 1776.8600000000001
having to refresh whatever you're using

1774.52 --> 1780.82
as filtration constantly and that would

1776.86 --> 1785.289
be a problem it should be we must find a

1780.82 --> 1789.1299999999999
way to filter it out without having to

1785.289 --> 1791.53
keep on inserting sacrificial material

1789.13 --> 1796.409
to extract it as it were that would be

1791.53 --> 1796.4089999999999
the best if that's ever achievable

1802.02 --> 1806.34
anyway yeah there's some environmental

1804.72 --> 1808.89
stuff it's been on my mind recently

1806.34 --> 1812.36
because you know with all this climate

1808.89 --> 1818.3990000000001
change panic and all this nonsense

1812.36 --> 1821.85
Greta and everything it's getting really

1818.399 --> 1824.7299999999998
insane and at the same time as this

1821.85 --> 1827.1
happens environmentalism actual care for

1824.73 --> 1831.98
nature and against boys and kind of gets

1827.1 --> 1835.6689999999999
distracted into this nonsense pit fight

1831.98 --> 1839.19
even though we kind of need to because

1835.669 --> 1841.7700000000002
it's it is ten turning into very

1839.19 --> 1845.1200000000001
seriously dangerous cult it's gonna get

1841.77 --> 1848.82
much worse trust me like pretty almost

1845.12 --> 1850.6789999999999
fantasy level cultists I pretty I am

1848.82 --> 1853.62
presuming at this point it's gonna go

1850.679 --> 1856.23
that bad yeah and well from what you've

1853.62 --> 1857.9399999999998
seen out there already you know that

1856.23 --> 1859.98
wouldn't be surprising if that turned

1857.94 --> 1863.7
out to be the case what I'm predicting

1859.98 --> 1868.679
right now so that is happening I am

1863.7 --> 1871.26
trying to do my best to actually bring

1868.679 --> 1873.929
back actual environmentalism real

1871.26 --> 1877.02
durable care for the environment where

1873.929 --> 1880.02
the nature and mankind both wins it's

1877.02 --> 1887.19
very important that win-win relation

1880.02 --> 1890.429
between man and nature is critical it's

1887.19 --> 1897.0
critical for for the survival of mankind

1890.429 --> 1900.779
and the world it should be in my

1897.0 --> 1905.07
personal opinion our primary focus of

1900.779 --> 1910.5
mine mankind anything else should be

1905.07 --> 1914.549
secondary concerning research and

1910.5 --> 1915.69
development technology wise everything

1914.549 --> 1917.94
else becomes secondary

1915.69 --> 1921.3600000000001
although yeah you can't really stop the

1917.94 --> 1923.64
AI economic rush because that's just

1921.36 --> 1926.1899999999998
that's that thing has gotten its own

1923.64 --> 1931.169
life so there's no use telling people

1926.19 --> 1933.0
you shouldn't do that sways and yeah who

1931.169 --> 1935.22
knows what kind of power struggles will

1933.0 --> 1939.15
come out of that eventually

1935.22 --> 1942.27
but as for the well what people from a

1939.15 --> 1943.77
genuine will to do good are spending

1942.27 --> 1945.78
then their time on they should

1943.77 --> 1947.94
completely step away from the climate

1945.78 --> 1950.49
change nonsense everything concerning

1947.94 --> 1953.429
that and completely go with pollution

1950.49 --> 1958.89
like micro plastics to which there are

1953.429 --> 1959.909
already yeah solutions at hand from

1958.89 --> 1963.419
nature no less

1959.909 --> 1966.659
remember the jellyfish goo that tends to

1963.419 --> 1968.6100000000001
filter it out make micro plastics and

1966.659 --> 1971.94
yeah that could be utilized in a plan to

1968.61 --> 1974.6299999999999
clean up the oceans and well my idea is

1971.94 --> 1978.65
filtering the rivers making it viable

1974.63 --> 1981.7800000000002
ground for some kind of fish farming

1978.65 --> 1984.27
there's so many things that we can do

1981.78 --> 1989.3999999999999
that actually help things well yeah I

1984.27 --> 1992.9089999999999
had more ideas the artificial coral

1989.4 --> 1995.669
reefs to say save the deep fish big

1992.909 --> 1997.74
animals give them more and and the large

1995.669 --> 1998.97
fish populations as well give them more

1997.74 --> 2001.22
chances to breed more

1998.97 --> 2005.3600000000001
breeding stations more stopping stations

2001.22 --> 2008.1200000000001
more life in general for this such a

2005.36 --> 2011.1399999999999
variety of life down there and it's good

2008.12 --> 2017.51
important life it does things for us all

2011.14 --> 2019.76
and then yeah combine all of it and then

2017.51 --> 2022.46
we may actually have a future with all

2019.76 --> 2024.5
the craziness that is coming out at the

2022.46 --> 2027.53
same time from humanity with their

2024.5 --> 2031.059
technological revolution with the insane

2027.53 --> 2031.059
backlash and cultism

2031.33 --> 2037.76
with the suffering that humans and or

2035.809 --> 2040.37
because of it and then reflect that on

2037.76 --> 2041.09
the world that's it's unfortunate

2040.37 --> 2043.6399999999999
side-effect

2041.09 --> 2046.4289999999999
so nature needs to be beefed up and

2043.64 --> 2048.1690000000003
basically guaranteed survival through

2046.429 --> 2050.599
all these focuses for all these

2048.169 --> 2052.46
processes in order to sit through the

2050.599 --> 2054.5
future whatever craziness is going to be

2052.46 --> 2055.419
further unleashed upon the world by

2054.5 --> 2060.379
mankind

2055.419 --> 2062.8889999999997
see that's my opinion I needed to get

2060.379 --> 2062.889
that off my chest

2069.93 --> 2074.5699999999997
we're still talking about a cutie

2074.79 --> 2077.889
[Music]

2085.85 --> 2093.7599999999998
Preston Parker you do realize that a

2089.11 --> 2093.76
gyroscope dispelled with a G right

2099.42 --> 2105.7400000000002
and gyroscopes normal physical

2103.53 --> 2109.5890000000004
gyroscopes don't have to have a

2105.74 --> 2111.27
50-degree per hour drift and besides if

2109.589 --> 2113.24
they would that would make no damn sense

2111.27 --> 2115.2599999999998
because they should only be going

2113.24 --> 2117.8689999999997
perpendicular to the axis of the

2115.26 --> 2121.2900000000004
presupposed spinning ball earth so that

2117.869 --> 2124.319
would make no sense but yeah ring laser

2121.29 --> 2126.869
gyros which are not physical gyroscopes

2124.319 --> 2130.369
but light based gyroscopes yeah they do

2126.869 --> 2130.369
turn 50 degrees per hour

2130.52 --> 2136.77
exactly

2132.44 --> 2139.109
rotating around the points perpendicular

2136.77 --> 2141.119
to straight down as well and no matter

2139.109 --> 2143.3089999999997
where you are apparently because that's

2141.119 --> 2146.7000000000003
the orientation of that rotation so that

2143.309 --> 2148.799
does not prove any spin of Earth it

2146.7 --> 2152.46
proves there's something weird going on

2148.799 --> 2155.67
concerning lights how it manifests that

2152.46 --> 2157.89
has drawn a lot of people throughout the

2155.67 --> 2161.64
ages to conclude that there may be some

2157.89 --> 2166.71
kind of spinning ether that is causing

2161.64 --> 2168.99
light to be affected like this and even

2166.71 --> 2171.03
speculated how that ether may also be

2168.99 --> 2173.5789999999997
involved into the manifest in the

2171.03 --> 2177.0
manifestation of other effects like for

2173.579 --> 2181.26
example magnetism so that is what that

2177.0 --> 2184.52
is about just for your information

2181.26 --> 2184.5200000000004
Preston Parker

2186.67 --> 2189.84
[Music]

2195.729 --> 2206.689
right and the ether drift as Constance

2199.699 --> 2209.929
Bruns hello says is interesting because

2206.689 --> 2215.359
of the 15 degrees per hour because guess

2209.929 --> 2219.319
what that's the same rotation speed of

2215.359 --> 2221.839
the Sun isn't that amazing since the Sun

2219.319 --> 2223.429
is one of the most powerful lights we've

2221.839 --> 2227.269
ever encountered and we don't even

2223.429 --> 2228.049
understand how it's happening actually

2227.269 --> 2229.939
yeah

2228.049 --> 2232.609
there's a lot of speculation who ball of

2229.939 --> 2234.709
fire bla bla bla bla bla right but for

2232.609 --> 2237.0789999999997
the actual things that we know we don't

2234.709 --> 2239.689
know why it's there how it really

2237.079 --> 2241.579
manifests but it's incredibly strong and

2239.689 --> 2243.2889999999998
registered all that light hitting the

2241.579 --> 2247.6090000000004
earth and interacting and the heat beam

2243.289 --> 2251.179
caused all that so it is rotating 50

2247.609 --> 2254.679
degrees per hour and so is the ether

2251.179 --> 2259.029
apparently so I wonder is there any very

2254.679 --> 2265.64
very coincidental direct relation I

2259.029 --> 2268.309
think so must be something to that so

2265.64 --> 2270.3489999999997
either the ether could be considered as

2268.309 --> 2274.3390000000004
a side effect of the manifestation of

2270.349 --> 2276.349
the Sun or the Sun is a direct side

2274.339 --> 2279.88
effect manifestation of the ether now

2276.349 --> 2283.67
this is not a causation relation it's

2279.88 --> 2286.309
correlation just for your information to

2283.67 --> 2289.2490000000003
get that right so I'm not claiming

2286.309 --> 2291.6400000000003
anything specific I'm just saying wow

2289.249 --> 2297.069
this correlation is extremely

2291.64 --> 2297.069
coincidental and interesting

2315.16 --> 2320.359
our released our e-cig dust so if

2318.71 --> 2323.21
there's no such thing as the ether then

2320.359 --> 2326.45
what is causing the ring laser gyro that

2323.21 --> 2332.299
light manifestation the spin 15 degrees

2326.45 --> 2334.3689999999997
per hour you tell me because even though

2332.299 --> 2338.329
it's not entirely clear what the ether

2334.369 --> 2341.359
is that is the designation to that

2338.329 --> 2344.48
effect and it it's as I've declared

2341.359 --> 2347.299
before it seems to be an aberration it

2344.48 --> 2349.94
that's what it's like it to me it feels

2347.299 --> 2352.94
very familiar to the way gravity is

2349.94 --> 2355.16
presupposed but then again we found a

2352.94 --> 2357.16
very viable alternative to gravity that

2355.16 --> 2362.8999999999996
is actually scientifically based and

2357.16 --> 2365.99
with the ether not so much yet so as I

2362.9 --> 2368.589
said before the ether may turn out to be

2365.99 --> 2373.43
a another glorious higher-level

2368.589 --> 2375.41
aberration that maybe even natural and

2373.43 --> 2376.7889999999998
not unnatural like gravity because I'm

2375.41 --> 2378.319
pretty sure that gravity as an

2376.789 --> 2382.73
aberration has been artificially

2378.319 --> 2385.069
introduced by man but the ether may

2382.73 --> 2389.089
simply be the aberration that anyone

2385.069 --> 2391.579
will always stumble upon and that'll

2389.089 --> 2393.859
probably be the end of it because it's

2391.579 --> 2396.5890000000004
just too complex to figure it out beyond

2393.859 --> 2399.529
there and besides nobody's accepting it

2396.589 --> 2401.779
anyway but it current could turn out to

2399.529 --> 2404.51
be an aberration that could be

2401.779 --> 2408.049
explainable by other effects and I have

2404.51 --> 2411.2000000000003
enough even close to getting there or it

2408.049 --> 2414.109
may turn out to be scientifically

2411.2 --> 2417.049
provable in some way that would be

2414.109 --> 2418.22
fascinating I have no idea how that

2417.049 --> 2421.069
would be achievable

2418.22 --> 2424.3089999999997
while altering the ether well we might

2421.069 --> 2427.69
not be able to alter the ether rotation

2424.309 --> 2430.25
or could we

2427.69 --> 2433.339
we'd have to establish first what's

2430.25 --> 2436.849
actually causing the effect of these

2433.339 --> 2439.7
parents assumed either in order to do

2436.849 --> 2443.23
that so yeah we've got quite some work

2439.7 --> 2445.72
ahead of us in order to get there a lot

2443.23 --> 2448.329
and you probably need some serious

2445.72 --> 2451.02
equipment eventually to really try to

2448.329 --> 2451.02
figure it out

2460.98 --> 2469.57
well Lori can you prove ring laser gyro

2467.05 --> 2473.05
drift was caused by ether and well no

2469.57 --> 2476.53
but the thing is it's light doing the

2473.05 --> 2481.15
the rotation right so you can call that

2476.53 --> 2483.34
ether because it is not identified in

2481.15 --> 2485.6800000000003
any other way because any physical

2483.34 --> 2487.8700000000003
rotation of bar makes no damn sense at

2485.68 --> 2490.75
the location where this specific effect

2487.87 --> 2494.02
was observed doesn't make any logical

2490.75 --> 2499.18
sense to even try to assume that but

2494.02 --> 2503.82
yeah that effect is called ether just

2499.18 --> 2508.0899999999997
you know just like Oh 9.8 meters

2503.82 --> 2511.71
acceleration per second squared 9 yeah

2508.09 --> 2516.4900000000002
you sorry that just broke that is

2511.71 --> 2523.93
gravity well 50 degrees rotation of

2516.49 --> 2527.2299999999996
light is ether how about that yeah see

2523.93 --> 2529.75
see why I already feel like it's so much

2527.23 --> 2531.7
like the aberration of gravity because

2529.75 --> 2534.4
it does seem to follow the same type of

2531.7 --> 2536.5299999999997
structure or setup doesn't mean that it

2534.4 --> 2539.5
will absolutely turn out to be an

2536.53 --> 2544.5
aberration but it does seem to follow

2539.5 --> 2544.5
the same type of yeah pattern

2546.68 --> 2567.3799999999997
yeah it's not this is no desease done

2558.7 --> 2574.81
yet is 15 degrees for our rotation of

2567.38 --> 2574.81
the light the light based device so yeah

2580.34 --> 2584.32
a mind warp yeah sure

2601.68 --> 2606.319
where are ya all right yeah

2612.82 --> 2616.6290000000004
[Music]

2617.94 --> 2624.94
hello

2619.3 --> 2629.6090000000004
oh yeah doing good you that's yeah good

2624.94 --> 2629.609
good so I hang on it's coming through

2630.359 --> 2635.08
can you hear me yeah yeah I can hear you

2632.71 --> 2638.89
fine my volume seems to be a little loud

2635.08 --> 2641.0099999999998
so this is better I think yeah yeah hang

2638.89 --> 2643.75
on for some reason it's going through

2641.01 --> 2647.8300000000004
yeah I've just gotta change your watch

2643.75 --> 2650.05
page yeah I've just it's coming through

2647.83 --> 2652.45
their own microphone as well I'm not

2650.05 --> 2654.48
yeah it's pretty this echo situation

2652.45 --> 2657.1899999999996
unfortunately happens more often with me

2654.48 --> 2659.41
if it's if it's really bad I'll just

2657.19 --> 2668.31
mute myself as you're talking okay that

2659.41 --> 2668.31
usually helps still there

2691.87 --> 2694.969
[Music]

2695.94 --> 2704.98
yeah no I called Mindwarp I think he's

2699.52 --> 2710.859
having issues with his Skype could be

2704.98 --> 2712.95
the latest update I'll try calling him

2710.859 --> 2712.95
again

2713.71 --> 2721.369
[Music]

2721.95 --> 2735.75
hello hear me I cannot hear you what

2749.22 --> 2754.89
yeah thanks for the super chat donation

2751.819 --> 2758.55
but yeah I'm not gonna show that message

2754.89 --> 2764.1189999999997
thank you I'm not gonna say it either

2758.55 --> 2764.119
it's just wrong it's not funny at all

2772.069 --> 2786.93
okay mind-warped yeah I'm not getting

2774.63 --> 2789.839
any sound too bad anyway because it was

2786.93 --> 2797.72
disgusting flatulent unicorn and not

2789.839 --> 2797.72
funny that's why I hit that ignorant

2802.57 --> 2806.4900000000002
are you on some kind of new medication

2808.26 --> 2816.2700000000004
flatulent unicorn because you're acting

2812.89 --> 2816.27
completely crazy here

2824.66 --> 2827.7999999999997
[Music]

2842.77 --> 2849.03
okay okay fine fletchinder corny it was

2846.22 --> 2859.68
just very very poor taste that's fine

2849.03 --> 2863.65
everybody can make mistakes oh really

2859.68 --> 2867.85
really you're calling me ignorant after

2863.65 --> 2877.1800000000003
posting that telling people to drink

2867.85 --> 2879.04
blood are you out of your mind no I

2877.18 --> 2881.3199999999997
think you're a troll and you're out of

2879.04 --> 2888.27
here it's just disgusting

2881.32 --> 2888.27
I don't need your super chat

2895.36 --> 2910.8
ah mind warps back oh no he's not

2905.34 --> 2910.8
yes he is yo

2914.45 --> 2925.75
I am still not hearing you no idea why

2921.41 --> 2925.75
wait are you a mute

2930.22 --> 2942.5699999999997
I think you got yourself on mute yeah

2935.83 --> 2942.5699999999997
you are on mute unmute yourself in Skype

2966.6 --> 2974.5499999999997
can you hear me now yes all right yes

2972.33 --> 2976.77
we're late I usually run everything

2974.55 --> 2978.21
through my condenser mic but it's not

2976.77 --> 2981.3
working so I just have to go back

2978.21 --> 2983.07
through the laptop mic mm-hmm well you

2981.3 --> 2985.76
have to reset the priorities and

2983.07 --> 2988.8300000000004
everything so yeah that's quite sweet

2985.76 --> 2993.1800000000003
right never had that happen before

2988.83 --> 3000.08
yeah no I um I'm trying to set up baby

2993.18 --> 3003.8599999999997
SMI Oh such pain in the ass yeah it's a

3000.08 --> 3010.37
bit work but what are you setting it up

3003.86 --> 3016.55
for um I just cuz I've got the new

3010.37 --> 3019.0699999999997
logitech camera say yeah I need to they

3016.55 --> 3024.02
try and do some streams for the rocket

3019.07 --> 3028.34
that I'm trying to do so what sorry say

3024.02 --> 3032.75
again for a rocket yeah did you not see

3028.34 --> 3035.7400000000002
the videos no thank you I'm doing I

3032.75 --> 3035.74
think Cheers

3037.21 --> 3048.02
yeah no I like I'm building some little

3041.51 --> 3050.92
prototypes I'll put the link in your

3048.02 --> 3050.92
side chat hang on

3051.91 --> 3058.25
yeah so basically what I'm doing I'm

3056.54 --> 3060.52
gonna like because I know how to build

3058.25 --> 3065.63
rocket motors out of potassium nitrate

3060.52 --> 3068.09
sugar and iron oxide just feel that

3065.63 --> 3069.7400000000002
little hoppy things but I'm gonna scale

3068.09 --> 3074.0
it up a little bit and try and get the

3069.74 --> 3077.0299999999997
mixture right and the plan is to get a

3074.0 --> 3081.11
rocket I'll build a couple of small ones

3077.03 --> 3083.2400000000002
to start off with I don't know if you

3081.11 --> 3087.11
can see me in your time at looks like

3083.24 --> 3088.4599999999996
yeah you're showing your life yeah so do

3087.11 --> 3092.03
a couple trying to find out what the

3088.46 --> 3094.18
best burn is and then scale it up from

3092.03 --> 3097.1800000000003
there and then I'm gonna rig up one of

3094.18 --> 3097.18
these

3108.91 --> 3116.06
so one of these okay that's that which

3112.7 --> 3122.6299999999997
is a Serb Arduino board well this is a

3116.06 --> 3127.2799999999997
knockoff I was going to Arduino Arduino

3122.63 --> 3133.28
so it says a pro get programmable board

3127.28 --> 3138.8
like a microprocessor okay so this one

3133.28 --> 3140.63
here it's just a smaller version it's

3138.8 --> 3142.61
got a Wi-Fi enabled and I can pretty

3140.63 --> 3146.9900000000002
much program that through I do we need

3142.61 --> 3149.3900000000003
to run things like servos or pretty much

3146.99 --> 3154.0099999999998
whatever I want really so the whole idea

3149.39 --> 3157.8799999999997
is going to be get the rocket like try

3154.01 --> 3160.73
and work out over a test like how long

3157.88 --> 3165.2000000000003
the burns gonna be so if I get say like

3160.73 --> 3166.55
a 20 second burn I'm even after that

3165.2 --> 3169.73
burns finish it's still going to have

3166.55 --> 3174.13
acceleration so I will put the timer for

3169.73 --> 3179.45
say 25 seconds and then this little guy

3174.13 --> 3181.94
will run a command to a little sir servo

3179.45 --> 3185.2999999999997
which you'll just lift the top of rocket

3181.94 --> 3187.93
up and then release a parachute and I'm

3185.3 --> 3189.65
gonna have cameras set up and yeah

3187.93 --> 3193.19
that's the whole idea

3189.65 --> 3196.04
self itself funded by the way like

3193.19 --> 3198.98
people don't have to put in any money

3196.04 --> 3201.02
but if they're interested to you know

3198.98 --> 3204.38
help out with some ideas or some

3201.02 --> 3209.78
pointers come over to my channel like

3204.38 --> 3211.6
not try and do a selfless yeah plug beer

3209.78 --> 3213.4100000000003
but no yeah you go ahead this

3211.6 --> 3216.02
interesting stuff why not

3213.41 --> 3218.06
yeah cuz I'm gonna I'm gonna do it step

3216.02 --> 3221.95
by step a so like I did a video the

3218.06 --> 3225.32
other day just getting all the materials

3221.95 --> 3229.0
then the next video I'm gonna do I've

3225.32 --> 3229.0
actually just made a test

3229.11 --> 3236.06
engine up which is I'm using iron oxide

3232.95 --> 3238.89
this time the first one I used aluminium

3236.06 --> 3242.04
so this one should get some really good

3238.89 --> 3243.87
burn and if that's the case and I'm

3242.04 --> 3247.23
going to use that one for for future

3243.87 --> 3248.58
tests say yeah and then I'll just make

3247.23 --> 3249.38
some diagrams up so you all know what

3248.58 --> 3252.36
I'm talking about

3249.38 --> 3254.4300000000003
and yeah so it's it's got to be a video

3252.36 --> 3257.9700000000003
one at the moment but they'll probably

3254.43 --> 3260.58
be 15 videos I'll say before I get to

3257.97 --> 3263.43
any kind of finished stage all right Wow

3260.58 --> 3265.64
I'll keep track of yeah I think I'm

3263.43 --> 3268.35
subscribed to ya channel I should be

3265.64 --> 3270.5099999999998
anyway yeah if you could put them in a

3268.35 --> 3273.02
bit otherwise you will have my feelings

3270.51 --> 3273.0200000000004
man go on

3273.5 --> 3282.06
yeah but I feel is very hard to keep

3276.12 --> 3284.37
track of everyone seriously yeah I have

3282.06 --> 3291.33
so many subscribed I'm subscribed to so

3284.37 --> 3292.3199999999997
many people I just can't I am can I see

3291.33 --> 3298.74
your opinion on something

3292.32 --> 3305.6600000000003
yeah sure but not not to beg like join

3298.74 --> 3311.9399999999996
now but hey great said okay oh I am now

3305.66 --> 3315.39
you mean bugga no joke did you did you

3311.94 --> 3315.93
hear the like Jose come on to the show

3315.39 --> 3318.93
last night

3315.93 --> 3321.06
oh I listen to her today on yeah yeah

3318.93 --> 3322.3799999999997
it's dead the whole thing was just

3321.06 --> 3326.37
totally insane

3322.38 --> 3327.96
all of it I had to turn it off a like I

3326.37 --> 3331.08
didn't listen to the end but I was like

3327.96 --> 3334.35
well I pretty much from the start so I

3331.08 --> 3336.81
also heard PJ going at it before Jose

3334.35 --> 3338.7799999999997
came in there was already just what the

3336.81 --> 3342.39
hell yeah

3338.78 --> 3345.6200000000003
I don't know Eric and John just goes off

3342.39 --> 3345.62
way too quick eh

3347.73 --> 3357.45
what do you reckon quantum eraser on

3353.28 --> 3359.6400000000003
Jose yeah I don't know I recognize I was

3357.45 --> 3361.5589999999997
being ok like I don't know I think we

3359.64 --> 3365.04
just robbed racing come in are you

3361.559 --> 3369.71
saying that yeah oh I didn't catch that

3365.04 --> 3372.839
part I have no idea yeah

3369.71 --> 3377.01
Jose was like hi just trying to to talk

3372.839 --> 3379.95
and got completely rumpus by quantum

3377.01 --> 3384.3900000000003
eraser oh no I just I had a garden today

3379.95 --> 3388.0789999999997
on master bee you probably saw it just

3384.39 --> 3389.7599999999998
like man what's going on my people like

3388.079 --> 3392.13
I don't know I'm just kind of sick of

3389.76 --> 3393.869
the fighting and everything like that

3392.13 --> 3398.28
that's why I'm doing this rocky because

3393.869 --> 3401.309
I mm-hmm I'm kind of finding likes but

3398.28 --> 3403.23
that's why I left before so I don't want

3401.309 --> 3407.8190000000004
to hijack your show man oh yeah go ahead

3403.23 --> 3409.7400000000002
I could you guys that's why I left

3407.819 --> 3411.359
before because I was like so many people

3409.74 --> 3414.6899999999996
are fighting all the time and it's like

3411.359 --> 3417.69
you know II like flat earth globe we all

3414.69 --> 3419.549
believe certain things we don't know

3417.69 --> 3423.69
what which one is right you know they

3419.549 --> 3425.49
say we can't just go along and just talk

3423.69 --> 3427.92
to each other like that you know I I

3425.49 --> 3430.2
just don't see that the point of it and

3427.92 --> 3432.359
I think you're the same as me like I

3430.2 --> 3435.0
think that's why you and I seem to go

3432.359 --> 3437.7
get along pretty well today all right

3435.0 --> 3440.28
yeah that's why that's why I want to do

3437.7 --> 3442.89
this rocket I want to find out for both

3440.28 --> 3444.78
sides right what the hell's up yeah we

3442.89 --> 3447.48
gotta all realize what made the debates

3444.78 --> 3449.1800000000003
great in the first place and that is all

3447.48 --> 3452.7
the field work

3449.18 --> 3456.5099999999998
yeah all the grafting during an early

3452.7 --> 3459.1699999999996
basis and then talking about that not

3456.51 --> 3462.4500000000003
just you're constantly addressing baller

3459.17 --> 3466.14
confusion doublespeak nonsense because

3462.45 --> 3469.799
that would piss all that in the early

3466.14 --> 3473.1299999999997
days they did that to sort of and then

3469.799 --> 3475.89
we just kicked them out and then went

3473.13 --> 3477.299
back to field work photographs all that

3475.89 --> 3479.73
stuff because it was just more

3477.299 --> 3483.45
entertaining more interesting

3479.73 --> 3488.369
but now it seems to be kind of stay like

3483.45 --> 3489.99
at it yeah it just that's what I reckon

3488.369 --> 3492.57
it's kind of like everyone's is arguing

3489.99 --> 3494.3689999999997
and it's kind of like a stalemate and I

3492.57 --> 3498.3
think people just need to get back out

3494.369 --> 3499.19
and start doing some stuff so that's

3498.3 --> 3502.1090000000004
what I'm gonna do

3499.19 --> 3510.089
hopefully it works okay don't blow

3502.109 --> 3512.49
myself up now with the iron oxide should

3510.089 --> 3516.72
me know it's a potassium nitrate we

3512.49 --> 3519.3289999999997
sugar and iron oxide it's okay it's safe

3516.72 --> 3521.9399999999996
if there's an air bubble the middle of

3519.329 --> 3526.5
the Rockets always the motors always

3521.94 --> 3530.04
bored out so it's got it's kind of like

3526.5 --> 3532.65
an upgraded version of our candy well I

3530.04 --> 3535.349
liked it I used to like fireworks a lot

3532.65 --> 3539.7000000000003
I tried a couple of very flimsy

3535.349 --> 3542.79
improvised Rockets with that yeah but

3539.7 --> 3544.47
yes to this level it's just it's pretty

3542.79 --> 3546.39
much the same as like when you go to the

3544.47 --> 3549.75
hobby shop how you buy those little like

3546.39 --> 3551.64
an motors to send like hobby rockets up

3549.75 --> 3553.89
like a couple hundred meters but they

3551.64 --> 3557.7
burn for like three seconds or something

3553.89 --> 3563.31
like that but I'm doing it on like a way

3557.7 --> 3567.24
bigger scale mm-hmm yeah yeah very cool

3563.31 --> 3568.71
be cool try to keep keep an eye on your

3567.24 --> 3571.41
progress editing because that's

3568.71 --> 3574.2
interesting so and I am just write to

3571.41 --> 3576.39
you now thank you very much thank you

3574.2 --> 3578.8489999999997
very much I recommend everyone to

3576.39 --> 3580.65
subscribe I have no idea how many

3578.849 --> 3583.23
subscribers you even have it didn't say

3580.65 --> 3585.63
I think it's gone up a little bit the

3583.23 --> 3587.76
last couple of days I'm up to 111 but I

3585.63 --> 3589.9700000000003
could do with more spread the word guys

3587.76 --> 3592.8900000000003
if you want to follow me on the journey

3589.97 --> 3595.0499999999997
just Mindwarp general and don't know

3592.89 --> 3599.0989999999997
forgive if you want to join you got some

3595.05 --> 3601.1400000000003
skills as well alright I do I do

3599.099 --> 3604.869
I made grantees enjoy a maid Jose's

3601.14 --> 3609.249
intro most about me

3604.869 --> 3611.739
yeah it that's it no so just for the

3609.249 --> 3614.259
audience just so you know this guy right

3611.739 --> 3616.029
he only has how many did you say a

3614.259 --> 3618.819
hundred eleven subscribers that's

3616.029 --> 3621.039
ridiculous for everything that he's

3618.819 --> 3623.71
doing and has already done like why is

3621.039 --> 3628.4500000000003
this guy not having ten thousand

3623.71 --> 3629.92
subscribers or something so yeah

3628.45 --> 3632.529
subscribe to mind worked

3629.92 --> 3636.369
he's a good guy and he is doing things

3632.529 --> 3638.2
it's very important nice to be a good

3636.369 --> 3639.5190000000002
thing that I have a lot of exposure at

3638.2 --> 3641.6499999999996
the moment with this because you know

3639.519 --> 3645.4889999999996
might get men in suits come to my door

3641.65 --> 3646.96
and tell me tell me off as long as

3645.489 --> 3651.5190000000002
you're not using any kind of nuclear

3646.96 --> 3653.44
substances or too much better iodine or

3651.519 --> 3655.66
something I'll be fine

3653.44 --> 3658.9790000000003
you could make a iodine based rocket you

3655.66 --> 3658.979
know they're actually doing that now

3659.17 --> 3664.809
iodine propellant it's super efficient

3661.569 --> 3667.839
yeah it's I think that it's our Russian

3664.809 --> 3670.69
military are using those now or

3667.839 --> 3673.0589999999997
interesting yeah I looked into that a

3670.69 --> 3678.16
while ago I don't because because I have

3673.059 --> 3680.1090000000004
flight League was I done in my medicine

3678.16 --> 3683.0789999999997
cabinet because I use that to flush out

3680.109 --> 3686.3489999999997
heavy metals once every like right yes

3683.079 --> 3688.7490000000003
but that's in my opinion a much better

3686.349 --> 3689.94
way to spend that material than to just

3688.749 --> 3694.109
burn it all up

3689.94 --> 3696.369
absolutely but it can be done apparently

3694.109 --> 3701.5589999999997
there and it's apparently even more

3696.369 --> 3704.65
efficient than regular rocket fuel such

3701.559 --> 3707.1090000000004
a nice day but yeah yes it's quite a

3704.65 --> 3710.559
ways it's not cheaper it's just more

3707.109 --> 3713.769
effective for the result they what I

3710.559 --> 3715.719
heard but that's like old that I heard

3713.769 --> 3718.2099999999996
that through Alex Jones I heard it

3715.719 --> 3720.839
through Alex Jones I heard that through

3718.21 --> 3723.069
Alex Jones so it must be true

3720.839 --> 3727.18
yeah that was just like 10 years ago I

3723.069 --> 3730.21
think or maybe five I don't know what's

3727.18 --> 3733.3289999999997
reflected as well why got deep platform

3730.21 --> 3735.13
hmm he got D platform for a reason

3733.329 --> 3738.13
because he spoke a lot of truth I

3735.13 --> 3738.94
basically forwarded military

3738.13 --> 3742.42
intelligence

3738.94 --> 3745.78
level data just tidbits way too early

3742.42 --> 3750.099
constantly ruining all the grappler

3745.78 --> 3752.8
plans yeah but he just gotta be carried

3750.099 --> 3755.619
away sometimes I think right but I think

3752.8 --> 3757.119
he would he did good things but if

3755.619 --> 3760.02
anything they did the wrong thing like

3757.119 --> 3762.67
now like everyone just nursery is now

3760.02 --> 3765.24
he's a guy that got a platform so he's

3762.67 --> 3769.39
probably even more famous now

3765.24 --> 3771.8489999999997
well famous you know the Alex Jones just

3769.39 --> 3777.069
had his own development and it's become

3771.849 --> 3781.03
really really messy so it's crazy house

3777.069 --> 3783.069
right now like I do kind of still follow

3781.03 --> 3788.5890000000004
his show but it's just become so noisy

3783.069 --> 3791.47
and just kind of just crazy like on per

3788.589 --> 3792.25
se an apartment nosy and crazy too I

3791.47 --> 3795.1899999999996
guess

3792.25 --> 3797.859
hit that type of audience I've been

3795.19 --> 3800.38
speculated as to why he's even choice in

3797.859 --> 3802.869
all this but maybe this is kind of a

3800.38 --> 3806.71
weird attempt as to a social justice

3802.869 --> 3809.079
warrior conversion attempt because that

3806.71 --> 3812.26
side is losing so bad that he's

3809.079 --> 3814.03
literally trying to adapt the level so

3812.26 --> 3815.7700000000004
that it will be more appealing for them

3814.03 --> 3817.48
to step to their side maybe that is

3815.77 --> 3820.81
really what he's doing it's just so

3817.48 --> 3824.17
bizarre if the last time I watched was

3820.81 --> 3826.45
where he had his lawyer next to him and

3824.17 --> 3828.31
he was like offering like it was like

3826.45 --> 3829.81
$10,000 then I went to like a hundred

3828.31 --> 3831.64
thousand dollars and he's like no offer

3829.81 --> 3837.81
you a million dollars if you can find

3831.64 --> 3839.7999999999997
the [Â __Â ] that hacked our servers I

3837.81 --> 3843.099
think he just got to be an emotional

3839.8 --> 3845.619
there is getting attacked for the art a

3843.099 --> 3847.9900000000002
little bit so anything you wanted to

3845.619 --> 3850.42
talk about man no I kind of wanted to

3847.99 --> 3855.25
round out the show because yeah real

3850.42 --> 3857.4700000000003
hours over yeah it was a good but II

3855.25 --> 3859.869
don't want to talk some more we could

3857.47 --> 3862.18
come back tomorrow if that's okay with

3859.869 --> 3864.28
you or did you want some more details

3862.18 --> 3867.04
you want it off your chest you know no

3864.28 --> 3869.849
no no no just we've been trying to talk

3867.04 --> 3872.119
for a while now and some yeah sorry

3869.849 --> 3875.299
because it is a good

3872.119 --> 3876.6800000000003
but not so good my love yeah we're on

3875.299 --> 3878.63
the same page with a lot of things so

3876.68 --> 3879.229
I'm sure we could talk about AP stuff oh

3878.63 --> 3883.219
