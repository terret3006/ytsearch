hazy

139.04 --> 143.599
although even with that it was still

141.36 --> 144.87900000000002
kind of nice and sunny

143.599 --> 146.64
seems to be

144.879 --> 149.92
a lot more windy now

152.08 --> 157.04000000000002
groceries

153.599 --> 160.319
before the show

157.04 --> 163.28
and yeah it was really nice weather but

160.319 --> 163.28
strong wind though

164.16 --> 170.239
right but yeah up there as you can see

168.08 --> 172.48000000000002
there's quite a few trails having been

170.239 --> 172.48000000000002
left

172.56 --> 175.519
over there as well

178.4 --> 184.76000000000002

jeff gas head kevlar good to see you all

203.68 --> 209.64000000000001
it is friday the 11th of march 2022

213.68 --> 216.239
yeah and

216.72 --> 222.08
i had a pretty decent sleep but i got a

219.599 --> 222.07999999999998
bit of a

222.48 --> 226.64
muscle

224.159 --> 230.07999999999998
nuisance in my back a bit it's not

226.64 --> 230.07999999999998
really bad but it's just like

230.56 --> 235.12
yeah i'm not like

232.56 --> 238.159
discontorted but it's like just

235.12 --> 240.4
like a nagging poke

238.159 --> 244.72
it'll go away over time just

240.4 --> 244.72
stretch enough and all that make sure

245.28 --> 249.599
i don't my muscles don't freeze up

250.4 --> 255.84
ah

252.56 --> 255.84
hey borders boy

261.759 --> 264.8
gadget inspector

265.759 --> 272.16
but yeah yesterday's show

268.56 --> 273.919
my own show was great i was really happy

272.16 --> 275.759
about that

273.919 --> 277.52
it was a great conversation it was a

275.759 --> 279.68
good subject

277.52 --> 281.44
and yeah i managed to figure out a title

279.68 --> 283.759
for it

281.44 --> 286.56
and i think that was very useful in

283.759 --> 287.44
general for people to just think about

286.56 --> 290.56
that

287.44 --> 292.88
about that subject about energy and

290.56 --> 295.759
the developments

292.88 --> 297.919
and what works and what doesn't

295.759 --> 300.8
it's a real theme right now out there

297.919 --> 303.28
i've noticed even like even

300.8 --> 305.84000000000003
weird ads star are starting to kind of

303.28 --> 305.84
address it

306.08 --> 310.71999999999997
so very happy i did that

308.639 --> 311.44
i hope a lot of people

310.72 --> 312.96000000000004
or

311.44 --> 314.8
algorithm

312.96 --> 318.71999999999997
pluckers

314.8 --> 318.72
information pluckers have been listening

319.039 --> 323.479
because it applies to everyone

325.28 --> 328.32
must be warm there

329.199 --> 332.24
decently

330.479 --> 335.96
let me check the temperature it's not

332.24 --> 335.96000000000004
really warm but

337.97 --> 345.68
[Applause]

340.72 --> 345.68
14 degrees yeah decent it's okay

348.4 --> 354.08
hey seeking star wars

350.88 --> 355.44
water good to see you i did wha i

354.08 --> 358.479
watched

355.44 --> 360.8
about 40 minutes of your show

358.479 --> 363.28
and

360.8 --> 364.88
yeah you i thought you did great

363.28 --> 367.52
for a first go

364.88 --> 370.71999999999997
and really even trying to find your

367.52 --> 372.88
orientation on what you were gonna do

370.72 --> 375.12
i think that was fine

372.88 --> 377.52
but you were basically in the show with

375.12 --> 378.72
a bunch of stoner hippies

377.52 --> 380.479
this is

378.72 --> 383.52000000000004
like really

380.479 --> 383.52
stone your hippies

383.84 --> 386.96
so

384.8 --> 388.88
yeah it was a bit

386.96 --> 393.63899999999995
vague

388.88 --> 393.639
but it did look like a lot of fun though

397.68 --> 402.0
but it was interesting because i noticed

399.84 --> 404.79999999999995
that you were basically well dream

402.0 --> 404.8
speaking a lot

407.12 --> 412.0
and that can be a bit difficult to

409.52 --> 414.4
follow sometimes

412.0 --> 415.919
unless you're really tuned in and then

414.4 --> 418.08
it just

415.919 --> 420.08
it's correct it's just a little

418.08 --> 421.68
fragmented

420.08 --> 424.0
what was interesting

421.68 --> 426.8
so yeah well done

424.0 --> 429.52
very long though i think that for if i

426.8 --> 433.919
had a first performance somewhere

429.52 --> 433.919
i would not have let it take this long

434.24 --> 440.40000000000003
because you're still like trying to

436.8 --> 442.319
orient yourself as to what you're doing

440.4 --> 445.19899999999996
right

442.319 --> 445.199
and then yeah

445.84 --> 450.31899999999996
you need some time after that

447.919 --> 453.039
to figure it out and then if you're if

450.319 --> 455.199
you're doing it again then

453.039 --> 457.919
you'll have a much better grip as to

455.199 --> 460.319
what you're going to be doing

457.919 --> 464.35999999999996
what your style is as it were

460.319 --> 464.36
but yeah good stuff

466.0 --> 470.879
surprised how long it got

468.639 --> 470.879
yeah

476.16 --> 479.8
hey elise g

483.36 --> 486.68
rake back

493.28 --> 497.52
they do do

495.28 --> 500.23999999999995
we do a two-hour show

497.52 --> 502.479
too long yeah

500.24 --> 502.479
well

502.96 --> 507.039
you could have gotten it cut it short

505.12 --> 508.96
but i guess yeah

507.039 --> 511.84
to be fair i didn't really watch the

508.96 --> 511.84
rest yet

511.92 --> 515.36
[Music]

513.279 --> 517.519
but i know it yeah especially if you're

515.36 --> 520.159
like a newbie it can be very hard to

517.519 --> 522.399
basically set your own limit

520.159 --> 523.8389999999999
and just say like now i think i've done

522.399 --> 526.399
my i've

523.839 --> 528.1600000000001
i've been on the show long enough right

526.399 --> 528.959
can be kind of tough to basically do

528.16 --> 531.36
that

528.959 --> 534.5999999999999
especially with your first go so totally

531.36 --> 534.6
get that

536.24 --> 539.519
yeah

537.12 --> 542.24
i agree kevlar yeah the input was very

539.519 --> 545.6
interesting it was very

542.24 --> 548.6
well it's kind of what i do to

545.6 --> 548.6
dreams

548.8 --> 553.1999999999999
and just like multi-dimensional thinking

555.2 --> 559.9200000000001
so it was definitely interesting

557.92 --> 562.4799999999999
but yeah i had a bit of trouble

559.92 --> 565.68
keeping up because yeah these guys were

562.48 --> 568.72
just such stoners and it all got a bit

565.68 --> 570.959
like a little bit too easy going

568.72 --> 574.08
and if things are if attitudes of a

570.959 --> 575.68
conversation are a bit too easy going

574.08 --> 578.32
you lose focus

575.68 --> 580.399
right it's hard harder to keep focus as

578.32 --> 582.24
a viewer on the subject and for them as

580.399 --> 583.839
well but yeah

582.24 --> 586.399
but still

583.839 --> 589.44
yeah it was

586.399 --> 592.959
i was like i personally was like okay

589.44 --> 594.08
these guys are kind of okay i guess

592.959 --> 596.0
but

594.08 --> 600.48
it would have been great if the more

596.0 --> 603.04
professional interviewer was there

600.48 --> 605.36
like i bet for example that if patricia

603.04 --> 607.76
steer was still out there you would do

605.36 --> 609.92
great on her show

607.76 --> 613.68
because she's really good at asking

609.92 --> 616.7199999999999
questions and and remaining focused

613.68 --> 620.7199999999999
and she does also basically entertain

616.72 --> 620.72
kind of like dream speakers

621.279 --> 624.519
like myself

638.0 --> 642.16
right

639.68 --> 644.64
but it was it was it was kind of funny

642.16 --> 647.8389999999999
too to to just see the interactions

644.64 --> 650.88
because they were kind of like oh she is

647.839 --> 650.8800000000001
like a medium

651.2 --> 654.399
and they were kind of

653.519 --> 656.5600000000001
yeah

654.399 --> 659.56
composing themselves towards you like

656.56 --> 659.56
that

665.12 --> 669.079
anyway yeah pretty cool

675.04 --> 680.24
have you watched it back yourself

677.44 --> 684.0790000000001
was there anything

680.24 --> 684.0790000000001
that caught your attention

687.12 --> 691.76
because like the first

688.88 --> 694.88
few the first few streams that i've done

691.76 --> 695.76
like i would like frank take the friend

694.88 --> 699.92
frank

695.76 --> 702.88
frantically watch it back

699.92 --> 705.12
just to see like how was i doing

702.88 --> 709.04
and i would immediately pick out like oh

705.12 --> 711.6
god why wasn't i more smooth there and

709.04 --> 715.04
why did i bring up this kind of like

711.6 --> 715.0400000000001
giddy side tracking

715.2 --> 719.76
got super critical towards myself but

717.279 --> 722.0
that did actually help like that's the

719.76 --> 724.16
best way to learn eventually is to to

722.0 --> 726.079
watch your own performances especially

724.16 --> 728.56
in the beginning

726.079 --> 730.88
to basically force yourself to confront

728.56 --> 733.4399999999999
yourself with

730.88 --> 735.279
like things of how you communicate how

733.44 --> 737.2
you present

735.279 --> 739.68
that

737.2 --> 742.639
aren't really all that great

739.68 --> 744.2399999999999
but like when it's just like a habit you

742.639 --> 746.8
have in normal face-to-face

744.24 --> 749.6
communication when you're not on camera

746.8 --> 751.8389999999999
right and to really feel the difference

749.6 --> 754.16
because that eventually

751.839 --> 756.32
enforces

754.16 --> 759.8389999999999
like the compartmentalization of like

756.32 --> 763.0400000000001
i'm presenting now on video

759.839 --> 764.639
versus just regular talking

763.04 --> 767.12
it's kind of important if you really

764.639 --> 769.839
want to be active on media on camera

767.12 --> 771.44
more often to to get that right

769.839 --> 772.48
otherwise you're just going to be super

771.44 --> 774.639
chaotic

772.48 --> 780.279
to people

774.639 --> 780.279
right so some tips hope hope that helps

786.32 --> 790.0790000000001
had a slideshow ready but scrapped it at

788.32 --> 791.36
the last minute right

790.079 --> 793.5999999999999
of course

791.36 --> 794.72
that can happen you know if it's really

793.6 --> 797.76
worth it

794.72 --> 800.0790000000001
you can always just do a solo on camera

797.76 --> 802.48
and do a presentation right and the

800.079 --> 805.4399999999999
funny thing about this that is you don't

802.48 --> 805.44
have to do it live

805.92 --> 810.0
and so you can record it and if you

807.6 --> 812.16
don't think like wait no no that was

810.0 --> 814.079
really bad i shouldn't have done that

812.16 --> 815.6
you could just do it over or you can

814.079 --> 818.16
edit it up

815.6 --> 820.639
do one little part over and edit that in

818.16 --> 820.639
and right

821.92 --> 827.16
you don't necessarily have to do

823.6 --> 827.16
everything live

827.66 --> 830.75
[Music]

836.079 --> 840.16
now we have the deck on all slides right

840.399 --> 845.48
and post the link yeah i'll post it

859.199 --> 862.199
um

874.639 --> 877.76
hey geoshifter

878.48 --> 884.88
anyway here's the link

880.639 --> 884.88
it's a seeking star wars interview yes

885.279 --> 889.88
from

886.16 --> 889.88
two days ago now

900.48 --> 904.839
the debut

901.839 --> 904.839
yeah

942.16 --> 945.92
hmm

943.92 --> 948.8
hey adam price

945.92 --> 950.079
yeah borders boy

948.8 --> 952.24
uh

950.079 --> 954.16
not too sure about that what you said

952.24 --> 956.88
there

954.16 --> 959.759
ascended masters aren't idols jesus an

956.88 --> 961.12
ascended master buddha krishna guinevere

959.759 --> 964.32
saint john

961.12 --> 965.839
queen affair really right

964.32 --> 969.839
but

965.839 --> 969.839
the whole thing about it is that

970.72 --> 975.279
they are

971.759 --> 977.6
kind of idols but it it

975.279 --> 978.32
what specifically should be like they

977.6 --> 981.279
are

978.32 --> 983.9200000000001
examples like

981.279 --> 986.639
and in that sense they are idols it's

983.92 --> 988.3199999999999
somebody to look up to and

986.639 --> 990.5600000000001
try to

988.32 --> 993.0400000000001
improve yourself with

990.56 --> 997.199
what they aren't though are

993.04 --> 1000.3199999999999
like leaders that need obedient

997.199 --> 1002.959
fighters for them or something right

1000.32 --> 1006.1600000000001
they're not idols in that sense that

1002.959 --> 1007.5189999999999
they are like dominant leaders and like

1006.16 --> 1009.8389999999999
like a cult

1007.519 --> 1012.079
because that's what people eventually

1009.839 --> 1013.6800000000001
end up doing a lot

1012.079 --> 1017.199
is they're just

1013.68 --> 1017.92
they just want some icon

1017.199 --> 1021.12
and

1017.92 --> 1023.759
yeah as an excuse to basically let let

1021.12 --> 1027.839
go everything right to unleash or to

1023.759 --> 1027.839
like unleash wrath upon some group

1032.24 --> 1038.72
or to be unreasonably dominant

1035.28 --> 1039.6
towards peers or whatever right and

1038.72 --> 1041.3600000000001
that's

1039.6 --> 1042.319
what they're not for

1041.36 --> 1044.559
they're

1042.319 --> 1044.559
like

1046.319 --> 1051.6
idols to basically remodel yourself

1049.6 --> 1053.9189999999999
after not to

1051.6 --> 1057.28
not icons

1053.919 --> 1057.2800000000002
idols not icons

1060.96 --> 1064.799
or maybe it's the other way around i

1063.039 --> 1066.24
don't know i hope i'm communicating this

1064.799 --> 1068.8799999999999
all right it's it's it's kind of

1066.24 --> 1068.88
esoteric

1069.76 --> 1073.52
right

1071.36 --> 1076.24
but especially jesus it was always

1073.52 --> 1078.96
saying like no you should be doing this

1076.24 --> 1081.1200000000001
too and and in the future people will be

1078.96 --> 1083.28
able to so

1081.12 --> 1085.1999999999998
others can follow

1083.28 --> 1089.039
the same path

1085.2 --> 1089.039
and even surpass in ways

1089.84 --> 1093.36
right what he didn't say was like oh

1092.16 --> 1096.16
yeah

1093.36 --> 1099.039
in the future everybody will know

1096.16 --> 1100.799
what the real authority is and

1099.039 --> 1102.24
like you will

1100.799 --> 1104.799
obey

1102.24 --> 1107.679
my laws or something or

1104.799 --> 1110.16
yeah or my followers will unleash their

1107.679 --> 1111.919
wrath upon you right that's not what he

1110.16 --> 1114.24
was about that's not what jesus was

1111.919 --> 1114.24
about

1114.64 --> 1118.24
and that's really the big difference

1120.4 --> 1123.4
anyway

1133.28 --> 1140.0
alex jose

1135.2 --> 1140.0
that sounds vaguely familiar geoshifter

1143.2 --> 1148.48
wait isn't that like a movie character

1147.28 --> 1151.76
guys are so

1148.48 --> 1153.1200000000001
right that's the movie character

1151.76 --> 1155.44
no i don't know what you're talking

1153.12 --> 1155.4399999999998
about

1158.32 --> 1161.28
from the netherlands

1161.919 --> 1166.3200000000002
no

1163.44 --> 1168.3200000000002
well he might be i don't know

1166.32 --> 1170.32
freedom fighter

1168.32 --> 1173.8799999999999
well i've i'm kind of embarrassed i've

1170.32 --> 1173.8799999999999
never heard of him

1179.81 --> 1182.869
[Music]

1187.02 --> 1190.74
[Music]

1200.799 --> 1203.799
okay

1213.28 --> 1218.72
is he on youtube

1216.159 --> 1223.0800000000002
gear shifter

1218.72 --> 1223.08
like where should i look him up

1245.52 --> 1249.76
hmm

1247.52 --> 1254.36
oh he got into what why did they pepper

1249.76 --> 1254.36
spray him like what the [ __ ]

1258.72 --> 1262.71
[Music]

1259.52 --> 1262.71
[Applause]

1275.44 --> 1277.8400000000001
hmm

1284.24 --> 1287.4
all right

1295.2 --> 1300.159
i found a channel from alex jose but

1300.24 --> 1304.48
it is a dutch guy

1302.0 --> 1306.559
so i take it it's the right one but

1304.48 --> 1310.96
yeah he hasn't uploaded or done any

1306.559 --> 1310.96
videos in in a week so

1313.44 --> 1319.679
it seems to be mostly just videos of him

1318.08 --> 1322.96
talking

1319.679 --> 1322.96
him talking on video

1323.76 --> 1327.799
and in his car a lot

1333.76 --> 1339.2
from the titles he seems to be a little

1337.2 --> 1342.76
bit of a bully

1339.2 --> 1342.76
a bit of a troublemaker

1344.64 --> 1347.8400000000001
smart ass type

1356.32 --> 1362.6399999999999
arwin and alex sosia what really

1359.6 --> 1362.6399999999999
i'm your hero

1363.84 --> 1366.24
all right

1372.0 --> 1376.4
it feels kind of weird though being

1373.6 --> 1377.9189999999999
compared to this guy

1376.4 --> 1381.52
i mean i have

1377.919 --> 1383.44
hair he has no hair

1381.52 --> 1386.44
and he's always wearing those sunglasses

1383.44 --> 1386.44
apparently

1395.76 --> 1400.559
it's got a weird weird pink shirt

1401.36 --> 1406.799
not like a soft paper pretty hard pink

1404.88 --> 1410.4
or like reddish

1406.799 --> 1410.4
i don't know what the [ __ ] that color is

1410.559 --> 1414.1589999999999
weird

1411.52 --> 1416.48
right anyway for reference um

1414.159 --> 1418.64
i'll post that channel that i found on

1416.48 --> 1418.64
him

1419.12 --> 1424.6399999999999
you're not attracted to oh okay i didn't

1421.84 --> 1428.1589999999999
need to know that

1424.64 --> 1430.7990000000002
thanks for that geoshifter

1428.159 --> 1432.88
spreading truth

1430.799 --> 1435.679
okay

1432.88 --> 1439.2
right but to be fair geoshifter i'm i'm

1435.679 --> 1442.159
pretty much only spreading

1439.2 --> 1445.76
my information through youtube

1442.159 --> 1447.8400000000001
like in the real world out here i

1445.76 --> 1450.4
i am very

1447.84 --> 1453.6789999999999
like undercover because i

1450.4 --> 1457.2
like all these people out here are just

1453.679 --> 1459.52
like i don't want to disturb them

1457.2 --> 1462.4
because most of them probably can't

1459.52 --> 1463.6
handle it i mean i'm already looking

1462.4 --> 1465.6000000000001
kind of

1463.6 --> 1468.559
a little odd

1465.6 --> 1472.0
and i have like shiny eyes and all that

1468.559 --> 1474.48
so it's like okay if somebody's ready

1472.0 --> 1476.799
for arwyn they will probably walk up to

1474.48 --> 1478.64
me and start a conversation

1476.799 --> 1481.279
and then i know oh it's okay those

1478.64 --> 1483.1200000000001
people could probably handle me

1481.279 --> 1484.559
because they're naturally attracted to

1483.12 --> 1488.32
my energy

1484.559 --> 1488.32
and that's when i start talking

1493.36 --> 1498.0
not necessarily talking about sexual

1495.36 --> 1499.12
attraction or anything because with men

1498.0 --> 1500.48
too

1499.12 --> 1503.1999999999998
just like

1500.48 --> 1505.44
i don't really talk to people i'm not

1503.2 --> 1506.96
like hey i'm here blah blah blah blah

1505.44 --> 1507.8400000000001
blah no

1506.96 --> 1511.559
i'm

1507.84 --> 1511.559
a silent guy

1515.2 --> 1520.799
like my strategy throughout my teens

1517.52 --> 1522.6399999999999
also was like i'm the guy that's usually

1520.799 --> 1524.72
standing somewhere

1522.64 --> 1527.3600000000001
where people kind of like overlook he's

1524.72 --> 1530.159
there and then i freaking just really

1527.36 --> 1532.32
absorb the dynamics of the situation try

1530.159 --> 1534.72
to figure out how the [ __ ] is all this

1532.32 --> 1534.72
working

1535.279 --> 1540.0
and that was what i was doing

1537.919 --> 1542.72
and sometimes somebody would come up to

1540.0 --> 1544.559
me and then i'd open up a can of like

1542.72 --> 1548.0
really heavy

1544.559 --> 1548.0
or spooky stories

1550.559 --> 1554.8799999999999
until i'd like

1552.24 --> 1558.24
until i lose control and like

1554.88 --> 1560.679
get like go too far and either like

1558.24 --> 1562.88
create this day like create

1560.679 --> 1566.0800000000002
dissatisfaction from the other side by

1562.88 --> 1567.8400000000001
accident or like give myself some kind

1566.08 --> 1569.76
of panic

1567.84 --> 1573.12
and then i'd stop

1569.76 --> 1573.12
that's usually how that went

1575.6 --> 1579.36
now i know a lot better how to basically

1578.159 --> 1582.7990000000002
manage

1579.36 --> 1585.039
myself so that i don't go too far

1582.799 --> 1587.679
in those situations

1585.039 --> 1589.36
a lot of training

1587.679 --> 1591.52
training through this

1589.36 --> 1593.6
it's just communication training like

1591.52 --> 1596.08
how do you handle your own energies and

1593.6 --> 1599.84
the anticipation of what's coming

1596.08 --> 1599.84
while you are communicating things

1600.32 --> 1604.72
the staircase talk is a lot about that

1602.559 --> 1607.36
right when i talk about where are you on

1604.72 --> 1609.44
the staircase of your consciousness

1607.36 --> 1610.8799999999999
what emotions are involved how is that

1609.44 --> 1613.1200000000001
gonna change

1610.88 --> 1615.3600000000001
how you see things and what you want

1613.12 --> 1617.76
with the situation

1615.36 --> 1619.6789999999999
i was always studying that always always

1617.76 --> 1621.2
always because it's like

1619.679 --> 1624.24
hectic to me

1621.2 --> 1626.48
like i don't understand

1624.24 --> 1630.0
i really have to like back engineer it

1626.48 --> 1630.0
all to to get a grip on it

1632.559 --> 1638.559
why certain things

1634.48 --> 1640.3990000000001
why people have certain impulses

1638.559 --> 1642.399
in certain moments

1640.399 --> 1645.76
i had to re back engineer all of that

1642.399 --> 1648.0
because it was just a giant random scary

1645.76 --> 1651.279
mystery to me at first

1648.0 --> 1653.6
didn't understand people at all

1651.279 --> 1655.6
though yeah my own impulses

1653.6 --> 1657.4399999999998
i didn't really understand but took for

1655.6 --> 1658.7199999999998
granted

1657.44 --> 1660.159
right it's like yeah of course i have

1658.72 --> 1661.919
these impulses because i have these

1660.159 --> 1663.7600000000002
impulses

1661.919 --> 1665.8400000000001
i just didn't really think about it too

1663.76 --> 1668.24
much when i was a teen

1665.84 --> 1668.24
anyway

1672.159 --> 1675.8400000000001
right

1673.6 --> 1677.52
talk to people who want the information

1675.84 --> 1680.559
that's right yeah yeah

1677.52 --> 1683.84
absolutely but that's that's where i saw

1680.559 --> 1683.84
the most success

1684.08 --> 1688.399
i've been people been trying to tell me

1686.32 --> 1691.039
from a very young age on because i was

1688.399 --> 1693.36
like even as a very young kid if i had

1691.039 --> 1696.0
like a vision about something

1693.36 --> 1697.76
if i somehow got a grip i was really an

1696.0 --> 1700.48
alarmist

1697.76 --> 1700.48
imagine like

1701.039 --> 1705.84
like being really worried about

1703.44 --> 1707.679
world politics or a war

1705.84 --> 1711.039
as a very little kid and then i would

1707.679 --> 1714.88
really try to like i'm gonna try to fix

1711.039 --> 1716.96
this somehow get the the right idea

1714.88 --> 1720.24
that people then eventually just started

1716.96 --> 1722.32
to tell me like yeah i know

1720.24 --> 1724.24
you're really desperate kind of to help

1722.32 --> 1726.6399999999999
right now but it doesn't really work

1724.24 --> 1726.64
that way

1729.44 --> 1733.679
right you gotta wait until people

1731.279 --> 1735.6
basically start inquiring about

1733.679 --> 1738.96
something

1735.6 --> 1740.24
they come to you they wanna they

1738.96 --> 1742.799
ask

1740.24 --> 1747.1200000000001
because only then will they be ready to

1742.799 --> 1747.12
receive your level of energy

1747.44 --> 1752.559
because they're not there yet so they

1749.2 --> 1754.96
kind of need to be prepared

1752.559 --> 1757.44
so they don't brace against like the

1754.96 --> 1760.64
giant boulder that's suddenly unveiled

1757.44 --> 1762.64
in front of them about to roll onto them

1760.64 --> 1765.5200000000002
they need to get ready

1762.64 --> 1768.0800000000002
be able to brace themselves for it and

1765.52 --> 1770.559
you know such moments by them coming up

1768.08 --> 1771.9189999999999
to you and being like

1770.559 --> 1774.24
there's something

1771.919 --> 1777.44
i was wondering or

1774.24 --> 1777.44
what do you think about this

1777.679 --> 1780.679
anyway

1781.52 --> 1786.72
what the

1783.76 --> 1789.279
hell flurfy krueger

1786.72 --> 1793.0
i recognize you

1789.279 --> 1793.0
you change your name

1817.919 --> 1822.3600000000001
hey summer trafficking arrest dad

1833.039 --> 1838.64
right but it's it's kind of funny these

1836.399 --> 1842.4799999999998
dynamics right the learning dynamics

1838.64 --> 1844.96
what's really successful teaching is

1842.48 --> 1847.279
being there when a student is really

1844.96 --> 1849.6000000000001
ready to receive right that's when the

1847.279 --> 1851.679
magic transfer starts to happen that's

1849.6 --> 1854.0
when you suddenly like climb a whole

1851.679 --> 1856.24
bunch of staircases together

1854.0 --> 1857.44
and exchange information on a really

1856.24 --> 1860.3990000000001
high level

1857.44 --> 1865.159
and like you feel each other out that

1860.399 --> 1865.1589999999999
you get the overall structure

1865.84 --> 1871.76
and that's really important to really

1868.88 --> 1874.24
get a grip on things

1871.76 --> 1875.919
and youtube

1874.24 --> 1877.76
this is what i thought originally

1875.919 --> 1881.1200000000001
youtube was for

1877.76 --> 1883.6
before it got all politicized

1881.12 --> 1886.9599999999998
and like getting involved yeah in

1883.6 --> 1889.76
political censorship and all that

1886.96 --> 1891.6000000000001
right i was thought like that

1889.76 --> 1893.919
youtube

1891.6 --> 1895.9189999999999
was basically

1893.919 --> 1898.88
conjured up

1895.919 --> 1902.48
invoked created to

1898.88 --> 1902.48
provide this unique

1903.2 --> 1908.0
different type of learning system that

1905.36 --> 1909.519
instead of like oh you go to classes

1908.0 --> 1911.44
always and

1909.519 --> 1912.88
yeah depending on your mood sometimes

1911.44 --> 1914.72
you're going to be in shitty mood but

1912.88 --> 1917.3600000000001
you can't skip because

1914.72 --> 1919.519
you get into technical trouble

1917.36 --> 1921.76
and other times you're like super it

1919.519 --> 1924.159
goes great and then whatever's at hand

1921.76 --> 1928.72
you're going to master it right

1924.159 --> 1928.72
well youtube is an on-demand

1929.6 --> 1933.9189999999999
potential teacher

1931.519 --> 1936.559
right there's already like cookie cutter

1933.919 --> 1938.64
expert courses on

1936.559 --> 1940.559
all kinds of things

1938.64 --> 1942.7990000000002
in unimaginable

1940.559 --> 1945.039
amounts of

1942.799 --> 1946.96
professions

1945.039 --> 1948.6
creative

1946.96 --> 1951.76
technical

1948.6 --> 1955.279
electronics it's just

1951.76 --> 1958.08
digital computing

1955.279 --> 1958.88
just calculus mat everything it's out

1958.08 --> 1959.76
there

1958.88 --> 1962.48
so

1959.76 --> 1964.1589999999999
that if somebody's like i really need to

1962.48 --> 1966.559
learn this now

1964.159 --> 1969.519
i'll try to find it on youtube well they

1966.559 --> 1971.9189999999999
will find it and if it's quick enough

1969.519 --> 1973.76
they're not being diverted for political

1971.919 --> 1977.279
reasons if they find exactly what

1973.76 --> 1978.399
they're looking for quick enough then

1977.279 --> 1981.279
the

1978.399 --> 1983.6
opportunity for learning could be

1981.279 --> 1987.279
maximized and that's what i always

1983.6 --> 1987.279
thought youtube was going to be for

1987.519 --> 1992.3990000000001
that's why i'm still kind of holding on

1989.76 --> 1995.12
to it even though like the leadership is

1992.399 --> 1998.1589999999999
just obviously getting

1995.12 --> 2000.4799999999998
carried around carried away

1998.159 --> 2002.3990000000001
by like this really evil political

2000.48 --> 2005.519
agenda

2002.399 --> 2009.12
so i'm like here basically

2005.519 --> 2012.559
trying to save the future of youtube

2009.12 --> 2015.12
so that like all this precious

2012.559 --> 2016.559
learning opportunity doesn't just go

2015.12 --> 2019.84
down the [ __ ]

2016.559 --> 2019.84
with the management

2026.0 --> 2029.0
anyway

2033.039 --> 2036.039
uh

2052.8 --> 2059.48
fluffy krueger

2054.879 --> 2059.48
oh it's adam price okay okay

2060.48 --> 2065.28
why would you call yourself flirty

2062.24 --> 2067.6789999999996
krueger that's like a really weird name

2065.28 --> 2071.8790000000004
it sounds like a total

2067.679 --> 2071.879
baller troll name really

2078.079 --> 2081.079
what

2091.599 --> 2095.32
right gadget inspector

2103.119 --> 2107.04
right odd jobs on the house but

2105.359 --> 2109.04
it's not yeah

2107.04 --> 2111.44
it's for the little things youtube is

2109.04 --> 2114.16
great but also

2111.44 --> 2116.32
even if you like oh i want to have like

2114.16 --> 2118.3999999999996
a bigger project like i want to renovate

2116.32 --> 2120.88
like my entire kitchen or something

2118.4 --> 2122.0
right or the bathroom completely a big

2120.88 --> 2123.04
job

2122.0 --> 2127.52
well

2123.04 --> 2127.52
it's very logical that you might have

2128.24 --> 2132.64
actual handyman that are like

2130.4 --> 2134.1600000000003
professional edit involved in doing that

2132.64 --> 2136.0789999999997
instead of just doing everything

2134.16 --> 2138.48
yourself because this usually takes up a

2136.079 --> 2140.6400000000003
lot of time and

2138.48 --> 2142.32
it's kind of tough

2140.64 --> 2144.8799999999997
and usually yeah especially like the

2142.32 --> 2147.6800000000003
bathroom you want to be able to get it

2144.88 --> 2150.4
done as quickly as possible

2147.68 --> 2152.96
right but then you can still

2150.4 --> 2155.76
look into it on youtube

2152.96 --> 2158.56
and see like how is this done like oh

2155.76 --> 2160.5600000000004
what are great new techniques that they

2158.56 --> 2162.56
could be using so you could have some

2160.56 --> 2164.96
kind of grip on how

2162.56 --> 2166.56
on what could be happening

2164.96 --> 2169.76
and then if you're going to have

2166.56 --> 2171.68
handyman do do it then you can kind of

2169.76 --> 2173.119
look at what they're doing to see what

2171.68 --> 2175.9199999999996
their level is

2173.119 --> 2177.92
and maybe even have little suggestions

2175.92 --> 2181.119
like hey i saw this you think that might

2177.92 --> 2184.839
be a good idea it'll overall improve

2181.119 --> 2187.76
even the use of handyman

2184.839 --> 2189.599
right so youtube

2187.76 --> 2190.88
that learning

2189.599 --> 2192.8
capacity

2190.88 --> 2195.119
that you can find there

2192.8 --> 2197.2000000000003
is a win-win for everything

2195.119 --> 2199.2000000000003
it doesn't necessarily have to take away

2197.2 --> 2201.4399999999996
people's jobs right

2199.2 --> 2204.24
it just makes people

2201.44 --> 2208.32
they get more grip on

2204.24 --> 2210.72
efficient doing things doing things well

2208.32 --> 2214.96
growing in it

2210.72 --> 2216.7999999999997
so less people would be stumbling around

2214.96 --> 2217.599
because they didn't

2216.8 --> 2220.2400000000002
know

2217.599 --> 2222.1600000000003
where yeah how to do it

2220.24 --> 2225.16
right it's it's much easier because of

2222.16 --> 2225.16
youtube

2230.64 --> 2236.4
liking the new show format yeah thanks

2233.359 --> 2237.44
rp 12 vacation

2236.4 --> 2241.119
12

2237.44 --> 2243.599
12 effication

2241.119 --> 2244.4
yeah it seems to work out great

2243.599 --> 2245.76
and

2244.4 --> 2247.2000000000003
uh the uh

2245.76 --> 2249.92
the youtube

2247.2 --> 2251.839
editor now presets it so i don't even

2249.92 --> 2253.44
have to click it it's automatically set

2251.839 --> 2255.7599999999998
to

2253.44 --> 2258.7200000000003
subscriber chat only

2255.76 --> 2261.28
seems to be working great

2258.72 --> 2262.3199999999997
right and now still a troller troll

2261.28 --> 2263.3590000000004
might

2262.32 --> 2265.76
yeah

2263.359 --> 2267.44
make an account subscribe just to say

2265.76 --> 2268.4
something

2267.44 --> 2271.44
but

2268.4 --> 2274.2400000000002
yeah you know i can deal with that

2271.44 --> 2276.16
and for them to like keep trolling me

2274.24 --> 2277.839
it's a lot more effort so yeah it seems

2276.16 --> 2279.359
to be working great it's a great

2277.839 --> 2283.4
deterrent

2279.359 --> 2283.4
i'm really glad i did that

2293.359 --> 2297.96
wow okay

2294.48 --> 2297.96
yeah that's awesome

2299.28 --> 2302.48
well i've

2300.88 --> 2305.6800000000003
through

2302.48 --> 2307.92
old friend circles even in there

2305.68 --> 2310.48
a lot of liberals there were some people

2307.92 --> 2313.599
that were doing that too

2310.48 --> 2316.32
like i knew a a guy basically who was

2313.599 --> 2319.6800000000003
also involved in like making sort of

2316.32 --> 2319.6800000000003
modern mud huts

2320.079 --> 2325.2000000000003
that were pretty effective and he was

2322.0 --> 2325.2
actually living in that

2325.68 --> 2330.3999999999996
and that's like

2328.0 --> 2333.839
yeah that's like

2330.4 --> 2335.52
eight or ten years ago

2333.839 --> 2337.68
when he was doing that

2335.52 --> 2341.32
right so and he learned all of that from

2337.68 --> 2341.3199999999997
youtube as well

2341.839 --> 2346.64
like or like that group that does that

2344.56 --> 2348.0
did yeah so many things have been

2346.64 --> 2349.839
learned through youtube so many

2348.0 --> 2351.2
developments

2349.839 --> 2354.32
right because

2351.2 --> 2357.2799999999997
a general person can't even imagine how

2354.32 --> 2359.28
far development could go in all kinds of

2357.28 --> 2362.8
different directions

2359.28 --> 2366.8
so there's all kinds of people that are

2362.8 --> 2368.8
doing some some singular thing right

2366.8 --> 2370.7200000000003
and then they're like developing it in a

2368.8 --> 2373.119
certain way they become really good at

2370.72 --> 2374.48
one thing and then there's somebody else

2373.119 --> 2376.56
on youtube

2374.48 --> 2379.839
that simultaneously is doing the same

2376.56 --> 2382.64
thing and then developing another aspect

2379.839 --> 2384.4
really like an expert and another one in

2382.64 --> 2387.359
another direction right

2384.4 --> 2389.92
and then you got this wide spectrum

2387.359 --> 2391.44
that you could that anybody who can get

2389.92 --> 2393.44
a grip on it

2391.44 --> 2396.32
can just put together and like get the

2393.44 --> 2399.599
best of it all all together right and so

2396.32 --> 2399.599
it just keeps improving

2401.599 --> 2409.04
in ways that seem like highly expertised

2406.24 --> 2411.2799999999997
that are all just individuals

2409.04 --> 2413.2799999999997
developed it

2411.28 --> 2416.079
and just because they spent serious time

2413.28 --> 2417.6800000000003
on it and share it now it's just out

2416.079 --> 2418.7200000000003
there and people

2417.68 --> 2422.3999999999996
all

2418.72 --> 2425.64
can use that and level up

2422.4 --> 2425.64
it's amazing

2434.319 --> 2439.2
you're unsubscribed what

2436.72 --> 2442.56
yeah wrenches will

2439.2 --> 2444.3999999999996
anybody with a wrench can always

2442.56 --> 2446.16
can always be in the chat even with

2444.4 --> 2446.96
subscribers only

2446.16 --> 2450.92
and

2446.96 --> 2450.92
even with members only

2452.48 --> 2456.72
oh all right rest ahead cool

2460.0 --> 2466.28
yeah i couldn't have imagined a better

2461.92 --> 2466.28
moment too you know

2467.359 --> 2470.4
so really good to hear

2475.28 --> 2479.96
yeah rasta heads moving to texas

2483.2 --> 2486.4399999999996
good choice

2495.839 --> 2500.7999999999997
living on land with yeah duh borders boy

2499.2 --> 2502.72
yeah

2500.8 --> 2506.4
if you're doing something illegal you

2502.72 --> 2509.839
shouldn't vlog it that's ridic yeah duh

2506.4 --> 2509.839
just don't be stupid

2510.319 --> 2512.64
right

2515.04 --> 2518.72
by the way youtube is like

2517.44 --> 2520.8
even

2518.72 --> 2522.3999999999996
not even the worst source of that like

2520.8 --> 2524.2400000000002
if you look at what's going on at

2522.4 --> 2526.88
facebook

2524.24 --> 2529.1189999999997
and all that

2526.88 --> 2532.8
and twitter and

2529.119 --> 2535.119
like people really just like brag about

2532.8 --> 2537.599
their crimes on there sometimes and then

2535.119 --> 2539.76
yeah and then they get arrested

2537.599 --> 2543.119
yeah duh

2539.76 --> 2543.119
why the hell did you do that

2543.92 --> 2546.16
yeah

2546.56 --> 2553.119
right it's not like but people on

2549.119 --> 2555.6800000000003
youtube i i don't really see that a lot

2553.119 --> 2557.76
i mean people on youtube do sometimes

2555.68 --> 2559.52
just make serious asses out of

2557.76 --> 2561.6800000000003
themselves

2559.52 --> 2564.88
and in do

2561.68 --> 2567.52
hopefully my new degree i've kind of

2564.88 --> 2570.0
done that by basically going overboard

2567.52 --> 2572.4
aggressive sometimes

2570.0 --> 2575.839
towards

2572.4 --> 2578.64
virtual individuals that might be real

2575.839 --> 2582.0
or not

2578.64 --> 2584.24
that i think deserve that

2582.0 --> 2584.24
right

2587.359 --> 2590.72
and then sometimes i worry about that

2589.52 --> 2593.04
afterward

2590.72 --> 2594.7999999999997
like oh did i go too far

2593.04 --> 2597.04
and then i'm thinking like well compared

2594.8 --> 2599.3590000000004
to some other times no it was it was

2597.04 --> 2602.24
still good

2599.359 --> 2605.2799999999997
and then sometimes i get to see how

2602.24 --> 2606.64
other people act out there

2605.28 --> 2610.0
and i'm like

2606.64 --> 2611.5989999999997
jesus christ and i was worried about my

2610.0 --> 2614.0
actions

2611.599 --> 2615.839
on youtube holy [ __ ] people let

2614.0 --> 2617.52
themselves go out there

2615.839 --> 2621.599
like really

2617.52 --> 2625.7599999999998
trashy as [ __ ] i'm like dude what the

2621.599 --> 2630.4
[ __ ] are you doing this is public

2625.76 --> 2630.4
why are you doing this to yourself man

2630.96 --> 2634.92
or

2631.92 --> 2634.92
girl

2635.359 --> 2639.839
sometimes it's funny when arwen is angry

2637.359 --> 2643.4
at a troll yeah well i'm glad i'm glad

2639.839 --> 2643.4
you think it's funny

2650.319 --> 2654.079
right

2651.68 --> 2656.319
that's better than that you just feel

2654.079 --> 2658.8
the same kind of pain that i do because

2656.319 --> 2662.2799999999997
when i get that pissed off i am really

2658.8 --> 2662.28
pissed off

2676.72 --> 2680.0789999999997
san antonio yeah

2683.04 --> 2686.96
never film when you rob a bank yet let's

2687.839 --> 2691.56
absolutely ridiculous

2720.24 --> 2723.24
mm-hmm

2744.64 --> 2747.839
right anyway

2755.119 --> 2757.44
all right

2757.52 --> 2761.839
it's weird

2758.72 --> 2764.64
i wonder if these trails from planes are

2761.839 --> 2766.48
if they're gonna go away fully or not

2764.64 --> 2769.52
because the wind does seem to disperse

2766.48 --> 2772.76
them a lot right doesn't look even half

2769.52 --> 2772.7599999999998
as hazy

2774.0 --> 2778.24
there's still

2776.079 --> 2780.48
you can still clearly see the difference

2778.24 --> 2785.319
with up there blue

2780.48 --> 2785.319
and down there kind of white grayish

2799.2 --> 2803.5989999999997

2852.88 --> 2857.52
like they never come here except for

2855.52 --> 2860.4
white doves sometimes there's like a

2857.52 --> 2862.4
flock of white doves and sometimes they

2860.4 --> 2865.6800000000003
like

2862.4 --> 2865.6800000000003
start flying around

2868.079 --> 2871.28
and they do kind of come and drink water

2870.079 --> 2872.88
there

2871.28 --> 2875.0400000000004
but

2872.88 --> 2877.6800000000003
no other than that like there are

2875.04 --> 2878.5589999999997
pigeons around like the typical

2877.68 --> 2882.16
fat

2878.559 --> 2884.7200000000003
gray ones and all that typical pigeons

2882.16 --> 2887.839
but they don't come here

2884.72 --> 2890.0
so yeah there is some bird poo sometimes

2887.839 --> 2893.2
but it's mostly from

2890.0 --> 2893.2
like magpies

2893.92 --> 2900.359
smack pies get really rascally

2897.2 --> 2900.359
with that

2902.0 --> 2905.76
magpies have an attitude and sometimes

2904.16 --> 2908.0
they're like in the mood where they just

2905.76 --> 2911.6400000000003
like launch their [ __ ] at your window on

2908.0 --> 2911.64
purpose and all that

2914.64 --> 2920.7999999999997
but no pigeons

2916.88 --> 2920.8
so overall it's not that bad

2923.76 --> 2927.6800000000003
seagulls yeah there are seagulls but i

2925.839 --> 2930.24
always scare them off i freaking hate

2927.68 --> 2930.24
them as well

2930.72 --> 2936.48
it's a bunch of looter birds they have

2933.119 --> 2938.8
no loyalty to a region

2936.48 --> 2940.559
they just fly over and then loot

2938.8 --> 2943.559
everything all at once and then leave

2940.559 --> 2943.559
again

2946.0 --> 2952.599
i'm always like go back to the damn

2948.0 --> 2952.599
ocean seagulls that's where you belong

2977.04 --> 2982.079
open carry in my rest oh that's

2979.119 --> 2982.079
interesting yeah they

2983.119 --> 2986.559
cool

2984.88 --> 2988.1600000000003
right yeah rest that yeah that's

2986.559 --> 2990.0
interesting

2988.16 --> 2994.2799999999997
yeah you're going to be able to be open

2990.0 --> 2994.28
carry there that's pretty awesome

3004.079 --> 3007.6800000000003
never open what what are you talking

3006.319 --> 3010.68
about

3007.68 --> 3010.68
douchebag

3012.16 --> 3017.44
why is open carry why is that being a

3014.48 --> 3020.48
douchebag kevlar

3017.44 --> 3020.48
what are you talking about

3024.0 --> 3027.839
cops open carry yeah no [ __ ]

3029.119 --> 3035.0
but as a citizen you can do that too

3031.76 --> 3035.0
in texas

3044.0 --> 3047.92
i don't understand why would that make

3045.599 --> 3050.079
you a douchebag if you open carry i

3047.92 --> 3052.7200000000003
don't get it

3050.079 --> 3055.8390000000004
isn't it basically a declaration of like

3052.72 --> 3055.839
yeah i am

3056.559 --> 3061.76
here to assist potential defending of

3059.2 --> 3061.7599999999998
the public

3062.079 --> 3067.319
i don't know maybe i'm getting this

3063.76 --> 3067.3190000000004
wrong i don't understand

3075.119 --> 3078.119
so

3086.16 --> 3089.7599999999998
make yourself a target what

3089.839 --> 3092.839
really

3096.88 --> 3101.6800000000003
right exactly that's what i thought in

3098.72 --> 3103.4399999999996
texas it's kind of normal

3101.68 --> 3107.8799999999997
i thought in texas they actually kind of

3103.44 --> 3107.88
respected people that open carried

3122.88 --> 3125.839
okay

3126.64 --> 3130.24
i think they're trying to no but not in

3128.8 --> 3133.599
texas

3130.24 --> 3135.04
i mean yeah in california and

3133.599 --> 3137.52
like

3135.04 --> 3140.24
at new york or whatever like the bigger

3137.52 --> 3142.72
cities yeah i'll bet right but not in

3140.24 --> 3142.72
texas

3143.44 --> 3146.88
texas they really have a culture that

3145.28 --> 3148.96
that's normal

3146.88 --> 3152.2400000000002
as far as i remember

3148.96 --> 3154.319
maybe there's some really

3152.24 --> 3156.8799999999997
liberal cities now

3154.319 --> 3157.81
that are being just as whiny as like the

3156.88 --> 3159.44
other states

3157.81 --> 3160.4
[Music]

3159.44 --> 3162.96
but

3160.4 --> 3166.839
overall it's kind of like tradition to

3162.96 --> 3166.839
open carry there right

3177.119 --> 3181.8
if i could when i walk around with a gun

3184.24 --> 3187.1189999999997
that depends

3187.359 --> 3192.16
well uh

3189.119 --> 3194.079
that was certainly would take a lot of

3192.16 --> 3198.96
that would take some getting used to

3194.079 --> 3198.96
right i'm not used to guns at all

3199.28 --> 3203.28
i would have to have some training first

3201.2 --> 3206.64
and yeah it really depends on where i am

3203.28 --> 3209.6800000000003
like i mean if i go to texas

3206.64 --> 3212.64
and especially like in a in a good rural

3209.68 --> 3214.64
area with like awesome texans you know

3212.64 --> 3215.5989999999997
sure i'd open carry

3214.64 --> 3218.64
right

3215.599 --> 3219.839
because i'd feel safe doing that

3218.64 --> 3221.5989999999997
and i

3219.839 --> 3224.48
yeah

3221.599 --> 3226.8
but over here no no no that everybody

3224.48 --> 3229.44
would just squirt themselves to death

3226.8 --> 3229.44
immediately

3231.359 --> 3237.119
but besides it's not possible here in

3233.119 --> 3237.119
the netherlands you can't do that here

3238.72 --> 3243.4399999999996
i mean most cops here i think

3241.44 --> 3244.96
aren't even allowed to carry

3243.44 --> 3249.119
serious

3244.96 --> 3250.8
not not all cops here even have guns

3249.119 --> 3253.599
some do though

3250.8 --> 3256.2400000000002
but they have like this really really

3253.599 --> 3259.3590000000004
really strict policy as to when they can

3256.24 --> 3262.7999999999997
use it it's crazy well it's good but

3259.359 --> 3262.7999999999997
still it's kind of like

3268.64 --> 3275.44
it's certainly no taxes over here

3271.839 --> 3275.44
and really weird too because

3275.76 --> 3279.119
like

3276.72 --> 3281.1189999999997
just realized that in the the far past

3279.119 --> 3284.7200000000003
from the netherlands like how it started

3281.119 --> 3288.2400000000002
we were just like texas here

3284.72 --> 3291.799
right people had their weapon they had

3288.24 --> 3291.799
whatever is necessary

3298.72 --> 3304.48
right if you were like willing to to

3301.44 --> 3306.16
learn to use it then there were multiple

3304.48 --> 3309.28
people in the netherlands even in the

3306.16 --> 3311.359
20th century that had weapons

3309.28 --> 3313.76
and then they disarmed everything oh we

3311.359 --> 3316.319
had to be liberal

3313.76 --> 3318.2400000000002
yeah and now it's not there anymore

3316.319 --> 3319.7599999999998
and everybody's scared to death of them

3318.24 --> 3321.359
because now the only times you get to

3319.76 --> 3323.28
see guns is in

3321.359 --> 3326.4
horror movies and

3323.28 --> 3327.8390000000004
brutal execution action movies and [ __ ]

3326.4 --> 3330.319
and then yeah you're going to be

3327.839 --> 3332.4
freaking scared of guns yeah no [ __ ] you

3330.319 --> 3333.44
know

3332.4 --> 3334.88
so

3333.44 --> 3337.44
i don't see

3334.88 --> 3338.559
like gun culture ever really restoring

3337.44 --> 3340.2400000000002
here

3338.559 --> 3343.8390000000004
that's not gonna happen unless like

3340.24 --> 3347.4399999999996
there's like this massive radical shift

3343.839 --> 3351.2
throughout europe or something but

3347.44 --> 3351.2000000000003
i hope that's not gonna happen really

3354.559 --> 3358.7200000000003
i would not trust you with a gun or

3356.319 --> 3362.64
thanks

3358.72 --> 3366.359
shoot myself in the foot absolutely not

3362.64 --> 3366.359
absolutely not

3377.119 --> 3380.119
foreign

3394.319 --> 3396.64
hmm

3396.88 --> 3400.799
all right well yeah at least you look

3400.88 --> 3404.559
it makes sense

3403.68 --> 3406.72
right

3404.559 --> 3410.3190000000004
especially if you're kind of a loner

3406.72 --> 3412.8799999999997
type that you'd rather conceal if you if

3410.319 --> 3412.88
your arm

3413.2 --> 3417.4399999999996
that makes perfect sense

3415.359 --> 3419.7599999999998
but if you're like really this community

3417.44 --> 3422.48
guy or you're like always with family or

3419.76 --> 3424.2400000000002
you're like the neighborhood

3422.48 --> 3427.96
watch type yeah of course you're going

3424.24 --> 3427.9599999999996
to open carry then

3433.839 --> 3438.799
but yeah if you're already kind of

3436.16 --> 3440.3999999999996
a loner then

3438.799 --> 3443.44
yeah it will be

3440.4 --> 3445.92
it will make the the gap

3443.44 --> 3448.799
of our socializing even bigger people

3445.92 --> 3450.799
will be like oh that's weird we don't

3448.799 --> 3452.319
really know him too well why does he

3450.799 --> 3454.24
carry

3452.319 --> 3455.52
that's creepy right so that makes sense

3454.24 --> 3457.2799999999997
that you

3455.52 --> 3460.52
you wouldn't want to

3457.28 --> 3460.52
have that

3470.88 --> 3473.88
hmm

3475.44 --> 3479.599
wow rasta that's pretty amazing

3484.799 --> 3489.799
no ralph rodriguez that's no

3520.96 --> 3527.2
right but i get it guys look i'm not

3524.64 --> 3529.2
when i said earlier like yeah sure open

3527.2 --> 3531.839
carry that's like

3529.2 --> 3532.799
after i've lived in texas for like a

3531.839 --> 3535.599
year

3532.799 --> 3538.72
right maybe or more and had plenty of

3535.599 --> 3540.48
training and like got to know people

3538.72 --> 3545.3999999999996
where i live first

3540.48 --> 3545.4
to see like if that's even gonna work

3548.4 --> 3551.76
right

3549.2 --> 3553.5989999999997
so yeah i i get it

3551.76 --> 3556.0
you're not just gonna lie oh let's go to

3553.599 --> 3557.52
texas and then just like open carry out

3556.0 --> 3558.64
of nowhere when you're not used to that

3557.52 --> 3560.079
at all

3558.64 --> 3562.48
right no of course you're not going to

3560.079 --> 3562.48
do that

3564.48 --> 3567.48
anyway

3572.0 --> 3576.64
right every man open carried for

3573.52 --> 3576.64
centuries i agree

3580.48 --> 3584.4
it's just people watching too much porn

3582.88 --> 3586.7200000000003
and too many

3584.4 --> 3588.319
horror and action movies really that's

3586.72 --> 3591.68
really the cause

3588.319 --> 3591.68
why people are just like

3591.92 --> 3596.48
not just immediately saying like okay

3594.16 --> 3600.16
everybody open carry just

3596.48 --> 3602.4
absolutely everybody

3600.16 --> 3605.1189999999997
do it

3602.4 --> 3606.559
because too much porn

3605.119 --> 3610.359
horror

3606.559 --> 3610.3590000000004
and action movies

3649.92 --> 3653.44
when i see people open korea looks to me

3651.92 --> 3655.28
like a sign of weakness yeah that's kind

3653.44 --> 3659.68
of ridiculous

3655.28 --> 3659.6800000000003
it is kind of ridiculous right back

3661.359 --> 3665.44
because

3662.64 --> 3667.7599999999998
that usually means like yeah that means

3665.44 --> 3670.76
they don't want to get robbed it's that

3667.76 --> 3670.76
simple

3672.0 --> 3674.64
like how is that a sign of weakness it

3673.68 --> 3678.52
isn't

3674.64 --> 3678.52
it's exactly the opposite

3686.0 --> 3689.0
uh

3714.88 --> 3717.88
so

3726.88 --> 3729.88
right

3766.96 --> 3769.839
huh

3790.96 --> 3796.039
yeah borders boy well it's a good region

3800.4 --> 3804.96
early bird guns and dating what

3809.2 --> 3814.0789999999997
yeah

3811.52 --> 3818.4
well i i really haven't had

3814.079 --> 3818.4
much to do with guns throughout my life

3819.68 --> 3825.68
i don't think i've ever fired one really

3823.76 --> 3829.3590000000004
did have like a

3825.68 --> 3832.319
an airsoft type of rifle

3829.359 --> 3834.48
from my from my parents i don't know

3832.319 --> 3838.4
like it broke eventually i did kind of

3834.48 --> 3841.68
[ __ ] around with that a bit

3838.4 --> 3844.4
but like never actual

3841.68 --> 3844.3999999999996
actual guns

3844.559 --> 3849.6800000000003
i was thought they were just way too

3846.559 --> 3850.6400000000003
loud anyway like every gun pretty much

3849.68 --> 3852.96
hurt

3850.64 --> 3855.96
hurts my ears

3852.96 --> 3855.96
so

3876.559 --> 3883.6800000000003
i mean if i'd ever like

3878.96 --> 3886.48
at some point for some reason

3883.68 --> 3889.5989999999997
had a gun i'd probably want a silence or

3886.48 --> 3894.68
two just to basically prevent damage to

3889.599 --> 3894.6800000000003
my ears if i ever had to use it

3938.96 --> 3941.96
hmm

3950.0 --> 3953.0
paintball

3968.799 --> 3975.52
i had a lot of fun

3970.64 --> 3978.319
as a kid doing a laser tag in my teens

3975.52 --> 3980.64
i thought that was really cool didn't

3978.319 --> 3984.88
really do it that often but the times i

3980.64 --> 3984.8799999999997
did it i was like wow this is epic

3985.2 --> 3989.2
but other than that now i haven't really

3989.599 --> 3994.079
been to any like gun ranges or anything

3991.92 --> 3996.64
i still would be like yeah if i'd be

3994.079 --> 3999.119
invited to one just to do that

3996.64 --> 4001.44
and had several guns available yeah i'd

3999.119 --> 4003.52
probably do it sometime

4001.44 --> 4005.2000000000003
that that does seem very interesting

4003.52 --> 4006.16
it's like an interesting experience i

4005.2 --> 4008.319
wanna

4006.16 --> 4010.72
i wanna go through like at least once in

4008.319 --> 4010.72
my life

4011.039 --> 4014.6400000000003
but yeah it hasn't happened so far

4015.119 --> 4021.48
yeah i don't really like paintball

4017.2 --> 4021.48
because it does hurt way too much

4027.52 --> 4032.24
i mean i think that paintball for like

4029.839 --> 4034.4
serious training would probably be good

4032.24 --> 4037.2799999999997
if you're actually

4034.4 --> 4038.4
preparing for some kind of combat

4037.28 --> 4043.1600000000003
but

4038.4 --> 4043.1600000000003
as just amusement no

4054.88 --> 4057.88
ah

4079.44 --> 4082.96
what are you talking about

4088.24 --> 4092.799
like what are you talking about guys

4090.16 --> 4092.799
inspector

4093.119 --> 4096.68
i'll get it

4108.96 --> 4112.279
hey eric1111

4116.08 --> 4122.5599999999995
time is flying talking about guns a lot

4119.6 --> 4126.400000000001
apparently in chat mostly i don't really

4122.56 --> 4126.400000000001
have too much to add about it right

4126.96 --> 4132.839
i mean i am all for self defense and all

4129.6 --> 4132.839
that and

4133.199 --> 4135.44
but

4135.759 --> 4140.4
yeah

4137.04 --> 4140.4
for practical use

4140.56 --> 4143.92
communication

4142.88 --> 4145.52
and

4143.92 --> 4149.52
psychology

4145.52 --> 4150.4800000000005
has always been much more influential

4149.52 --> 4152.56
for me

4150.48 --> 4154.799
as a tactic

4152.56 --> 4157.679
like i always

4154.799 --> 4159.92
like i've just figured out at some point

4157.679 --> 4162.0
as a teen already that like yeah there's

4159.92 --> 4163.92
some people that always get stuck in

4162.0 --> 4167.92
fights why

4163.92 --> 4167.92
because they take up the fight

4168.0 --> 4172.799
but what you can have different dynamics

4170.96 --> 4174.4800000000005
in response to people looking for

4172.799 --> 4177.199
trouble

4174.48 --> 4179.5199999999995
even if they're like outnumbering you

4177.199 --> 4182.08
it's all about the energy

4179.52 --> 4183.92
like if you're basically accepting the

4182.08 --> 4186.48
challenge and are you saying to yourself

4183.92 --> 4191.04
like i am going to fight now yeah then

4186.48 --> 4191.04
you are but if you just like

4191.359 --> 4198.2390000000005
work on the the pre-fight negotiation

4195.84 --> 4201.04
which is kind of like a it's it's a

4198.239 --> 4203.919999999999
unique thing it's a play it's a playful

4201.04 --> 4206.719
situation often and you get to

4203.92 --> 4208.0
deal with like people's inner demons

4206.719 --> 4211.76
even

4208.0 --> 4213.679
right and if you can handle that

4211.76 --> 4215.679
and i can

4213.679 --> 4218.32
have in the past

4215.679 --> 4219.92
or basically say saying to yourself if

4218.32 --> 4221.5199999999995
somebody's looking for trouble like that

4219.92 --> 4223.36
like these people

4221.52 --> 4225.120000000001
have issues with themselves they don't

4223.36 --> 4227.04
actually have an issue with me they

4225.12 --> 4228.8
projected it on to me and they're just

4227.04 --> 4231.199
looking

4228.8 --> 4232.88
for a physical workout

4231.199 --> 4234.879999999999
to get their mind

4232.88 --> 4236.64
off their inner demon

4234.88 --> 4238.719
and if you recognize that if you

4236.64 --> 4240.159000000001
actually in the moment recognize that

4238.719 --> 4242.4
and not get

4240.159 --> 4245.44
snapped into a

4242.4 --> 4247.5199999999995
i'm going to fight mood into

4245.44 --> 4247.5199999999995
a

4248.64 --> 4252.88
composure like that

4250.64 --> 4255.1990000000005
then you can just

4252.88 --> 4257.12
figure basically give the person what

4255.199 --> 4260.08
they really need

4257.12 --> 4262.08
through an unexpected way

4260.08 --> 4264.159
without them even having to feel like

4262.08 --> 4265.679
they're underneath you or they're less

4264.159 --> 4268.239
than you right you don't even have to

4265.679 --> 4270.56
shame them you can just help them fix

4268.239 --> 4274.718999999999
something in an unexpected way

4270.56 --> 4277.84
and then never get into a fight

4274.719 --> 4281.12
and that's what i learned to do

4277.84 --> 4284.08
as a teen as a little kid i didn't know

4281.12 --> 4286.32
how to do it and i would always freaking

4284.08 --> 4288.5599999999995
end up

4286.32 --> 4290.239
getting shamed i wouldn't go into a

4288.56 --> 4292.400000000001
fight because i was scared i would be

4290.239 --> 4294.959999999999
like trembly trembly

4292.4 --> 4295.839999999999
it wouldn't work for me

4294.96 --> 4298.159
right

4295.84 --> 4300.96
unless it did work and then i got like

4298.159 --> 4302.96
infused by super raging would go way too

4300.96 --> 4305.6
far basically start

4302.96 --> 4307.52
clawing at people with my nails and [ __ ]

4305.6 --> 4308.400000000001
like way out of control

4307.52 --> 4311.52
right

4308.4 --> 4313.5199999999995
so fighting for me was always

4311.52 --> 4316.0
like bad

4313.52 --> 4318.88
and then i used that

4316.0 --> 4321.84
to instead instead of just like oh i

4318.88 --> 4324.08
will always be bullied i will be like

4321.84 --> 4326.96
i'm literally going to conquer their

4324.08 --> 4329.12
demons by understanding them

4326.96 --> 4331.199
and helping them in a way that they

4329.12 --> 4332.719
didn't even thought was possible and

4331.199 --> 4334.0
that way

4332.719 --> 4336.64
force

4334.0 --> 4340.4
them to gain respect for me so that they

4336.64 --> 4343.12
wouldn't want to attack me anymore

4340.4 --> 4345.679
and that tactic i pretty much worked on

4343.12 --> 4349.36
my entire life

4345.679 --> 4350.96
it's my survival mechanism my diplomacy

4349.36 --> 4353.679
and it works

4350.96 --> 4355.6
and i can even explain it to people how

4353.679 --> 4358.56
it works now

4355.6 --> 4358.56
how about that huh

4359.199 --> 4363.44
could see me as a boxer well i don't

4361.04 --> 4367.04
know what you're seeing but it's not me

4363.44 --> 4367.04
i'm not a freaking boxer

4368.88 --> 4372.400000000001
i mean i can kick the [ __ ] out of people

4371.199 --> 4373.599999999999
but

4372.4 --> 4377.199
fist

4373.6 --> 4377.1990000000005
it's never really worked for me

4378.8 --> 4384.159000000001
i mean i can slap somebody really

4381.6 --> 4386.64
painfully but actually like knock

4384.159 --> 4390.04
somebody out or something

4386.64 --> 4390.04
i don't know

4401.36 --> 4405.199
learn a future what the [ __ ]

4405.28 --> 4411.12
why would i need to learn that no but i

4407.92 --> 4412.56
got tricks i know like how to basically

4411.12 --> 4415.12
like

4412.56 --> 4417.1990000000005
yeah keep somebody in like a wrist lock

4415.12 --> 4419.76
and that sort of [ __ ]

4417.199 --> 4422.639999999999
it's all intuition but i never need to

4419.76 --> 4424.4800000000005
use that right if i've if i put somebody

4422.64 --> 4426.96
into a wrist lock

4424.48 --> 4427.839999999999
then i've effectively already humiliated

4426.96 --> 4430.32
them

4427.84 --> 4432.4800000000005
which means that they're probably gonna

4430.32 --> 4435.84
build a little grudge against me if i

4432.48 --> 4437.599999999999
ever then in the future try to diplomat

4435.84 --> 4440.4800000000005
myself out of it

4437.6 --> 4442.159000000001
they're still gonna want to punish me

4440.48 --> 4444.639999999999
right

4442.159 --> 4446.719
this is all about wielding

4444.64 --> 4448.96
demons of people

4446.719 --> 4448.96
right

4450.719 --> 4456.08
so even though i can

4453.199 --> 4457.5199999999995
physically like use little tricks and

4456.08 --> 4460.719
all that

4457.52 --> 4464.0
to disable people i don't do that it's

4460.719 --> 4464.0
not my strategy

4464.88 --> 4469.1990000000005
right and there's guys i've known that

4466.719 --> 4471.199
are absolutely all about that they're

4469.199 --> 4473.919999999999
very physical and that they would do

4471.199 --> 4475.599999999999
that every time

4473.92 --> 4477.4400000000005
right those people

4475.6 --> 4481.120000000001
would not have a lot of subtle

4477.44 --> 4482.48
communication skills

4481.12 --> 4485.199
i do

4482.48 --> 4488.48
and i want to actually utilize them

4485.199 --> 4490.799999999999
so i have to avoid physical violence

4488.48 --> 4495.0
because that works against

4490.8 --> 4495.0
the utilization of that

4496.88 --> 4502.6
last fight i got into was overcame risk

4511.12 --> 4516.4
yeah thanks rastad

4513.52 --> 4519.64
well yeah certainly the best choice

4516.4 --> 4519.639999999999
for me

4532.96 --> 4535.96
do

4547.28 --> 4553.8
street fight no

4549.6 --> 4553.8
street fighter god

4554.32 --> 4558.92
no no no it's not gonna work for me

4566.239 --> 4570.718999999999
i mean if i was really inspired i could

4568.56 --> 4574.2390000000005
probably then

4570.719 --> 4576.4
carry that inspiration onto a mob or a

4574.239 --> 4579.28
mass of people

4576.4 --> 4581.44
if i was if it really was the right

4579.28 --> 4584.08
moment right i can do that sort of thing

4581.44 --> 4586.08
i have public speech skills

4584.08 --> 4588.719
right i mean i'm not

4586.08 --> 4590.5599999999995
like trump level

4588.719 --> 4591.36
right it doesn't work like that for me

4590.56 --> 4595.1990000000005
but

4591.36 --> 4597.679
i have some skill there i just very

4595.199 --> 4598.96
very rarely use it

4597.679 --> 4601.4400000000005
because

4598.96 --> 4602.8
it like has the pretty impactful

4601.44 --> 4606.5599999999995
influence

4602.8 --> 4610.0
if not on the people i do it with than

4606.56 --> 4611.1990000000005
on myself and like how the energy

4610.0 --> 4614.0
changes

4611.199 --> 4617.0
like around me and everything

4614.0 --> 4617.0
so

4622.64 --> 4626.56
i mean what i'm doing here is yeah you

4624.719 --> 4628.8
could say it's public speaking but it's

4626.56 --> 4631.04
not really public speaking though right

4628.8 --> 4633.4400000000005
we're not literally on the same physical

4631.04 --> 4633.44
space

4635.6 --> 4639.360000000001
we're all

4636.96 --> 4641.84
individually listening

4639.36 --> 4644.4
that's different

4641.84 --> 4647.360000000001
then certain like group dynamic effects

4644.4 --> 4647.36
they don't apply

4648.719 --> 4654.32
and then if you do the public speech

4651.12 --> 4657.599999999999
effects it will just really seem like

4654.32 --> 4659.679
you're just monologuing

4657.6 --> 4662.2390000000005
right it doesn't work

4659.679 --> 4667.1990000000005
i have to actually do it in front of

4662.239 --> 4667.199
everybody and then that suddenly clicks

4668.08 --> 4671.08
right

4684.32 --> 4690.719
what the [ __ ] are you talking about guys

4688.159 --> 4693.679
oh that's terrible referee why the hell

4690.719 --> 4696.32
would you ever

4693.679 --> 4696.32
bring that up

4696.48 --> 4701.5199999999995
like dirty tactics are terrible like

4699.679 --> 4705.28
terrible

4701.52 --> 4707.1990000000005
don't do that don't do that unless like

4705.28 --> 4709.28
you feel somebody's literally planning

4707.199 --> 4710.159
to kill you or something

4709.28 --> 4711.28
right

4710.159 --> 4712.5599999999995
never

4711.28 --> 4716.28
never do that

4712.56 --> 4716.280000000001
don't bring that up

4720.08 --> 4724.239
no i'm not going to do pigeon hunting

4722.239 --> 4726.159
what kind of dude what the [ __ ] wrong

4724.239 --> 4729.759999999999
with you

4726.159 --> 4729.759999999999
why do you even think that's funny

4731.52 --> 4735.8
why why do you think that's funny

4743.12 --> 4750.5599999999995
you think it's you think i

4745.36 --> 4750.5599999999995
enjoy just killing animals for sport

4753.04 --> 4756.56
i don't

4754.4 --> 4761.719
yeah i'm a freaking empath

4756.56 --> 4761.719
i don't think killing things is funny

4773.12 --> 4776.88
is it meant to be funny well he did put

4775.6 --> 4780.92
that

4776.88 --> 4780.92
laughing smiley there

4791.76 --> 4795.76
it's called hunting yeah it's called

4793.52 --> 4796.56
completely pointless

4795.76 --> 4798.719
and

4796.56 --> 4800.159000000001
literally killing things yeah why would

4798.719 --> 4802.8
i do that

4800.159 --> 4805.92
like i'm not gonna eat pigeons

4802.8 --> 4808.56
right i mean if i'm gonna hunt something

4805.92 --> 4811.04
that means i plan to eat it well i'm not

4808.56 --> 4814.04
gonna eat freaking pigeons

4811.04 --> 4814.04
okay

4828.78 --> 4834.48
[Music]

4831.6 --> 4836.639
i mean i will never just hunt

4834.48 --> 4838.5599999999995
for a freaking sport like

4836.639 --> 4840.400000000001
if i be caught

4838.56 --> 4842.56
like i won't be but

4840.4 --> 4844.239
it's just a principle like if you're

4842.56 --> 4846.400000000001
gonna hunt something

4844.239 --> 4847.678999999999
then you better damn well honor the

4846.4 --> 4848.799999999999
death

4847.679 --> 4851.1990000000005
right

4848.8 --> 4852.56
you better use

4851.199 --> 4856.08
like

4852.56 --> 4857.52
like make a coat or a shoes out of it

4856.08 --> 4861.12
right

4857.52 --> 4864.0
and eat it or eat it like just don't

4861.12 --> 4865.199
just let it just be another carcass for

4864.0 --> 4868.8
nothing

4865.199 --> 4868.799999999999
i think that's horrific

4869.679 --> 4873.92
just killing to kill it's just terrible

4872.0 --> 4876.239
right if you're gonna do something like

4873.92 --> 4878.56
that then

4876.239 --> 4880.48
like the native americans kind of do

4878.56 --> 4883.6
honor it

4880.48 --> 4883.599999999999
use everything

4884.56 --> 4889.84
honor the sacrifice

4886.8 --> 4889.84
that it made for you

4891.52 --> 4893.76
right

4895.84 --> 4900.56
pigeons near you are like ninjas what

4898.08 --> 4900.5599999999995
the [ __ ]

4901.44 --> 4906.4
yeah i don't eat no make great soup

4904.8 --> 4910.08
okay

4906.4 --> 4911.28
well city pigeons uh i don't want to eat

4910.08 --> 4914.84
that

4911.28 --> 4914.84

4947.84 --> 4952.32

4949.44 --> 4954.96
when i say i like gun rights i don't

4952.32 --> 4956.96

4954.96 --> 4960.0
let's just freaking kill things yeah

4956.96 --> 4962.4800000000005
that's that's the thing i don't like

4960.0 --> 4964.88
yeah i don't like that not saying that

4962.48 --> 4967.28
hunting should be illegal

4964.88 --> 4970.32
absolutely not but i don't like it i

4967.28 --> 4970.32
don't have to like it

4970.96 --> 4974.8
and i have reasons why i don't like that

4972.96 --> 4976.96
i explained that and think it's kind of

4974.8 --> 4980.6
gross that you guys are just

4976.96 --> 4980.6
talking like that

4995.199 --> 4999.44
hey lumpy guess yeah i know i'm not

4997.44 --> 5001.759999999999
talking about freaking casinos i'm

4999.44 --> 5003.599999999999
talking about the old traditions right

5001.76 --> 5005.76
just because they don't do it anymore

5003.6 --> 5007.92
doesn't mean that

5005.76 --> 5010.92
that it wasn't a good way of doing

5007.92 --> 5010.92
things

5017.12 --> 5024.12
it's just joked what yeah i don't like

5019.679 --> 5024.12
those jokes i'm sorry

5032.0 --> 5036.8
right and i have hunted by the way

5035.44 --> 5038.32
a fish

5036.8 --> 5040.719
yeah

5038.32 --> 5044.08
went snorkeling with a harpoon i shot a

5040.719 --> 5049.04
fish it was heartbreaking to me really

5044.08 --> 5050.159
weird and it was it's heartbreaking but

5049.04 --> 5052.8
at least

5050.159 --> 5055.12
it was later that day eaten on the

5052.8 --> 5057.28
barbecue by my parents because i don't

5055.12 --> 5060.88
like eating fish but i basically offered

5057.28 --> 5064.639
it to them they said it was amazing

5060.88 --> 5064.639
so that kind of made it all right

5066.719 --> 5071.84
by the way it was like eight

5069.199 --> 5071.839999999999
when i did that

5072.48 --> 5075.5199999999995
but yeah

5073.76 --> 5078.8
i was really

5075.52 --> 5081.120000000001
like horrified by when i actually shot

5078.8 --> 5083.76
it how it was yeah it didn't just

5081.12 --> 5086.5599999999995
instantly die it was all like

5083.76 --> 5088.320000000001
and that was horrific i felt it i felt

5086.56 --> 5091.679
the pain

5088.32 --> 5091.679
even though it's a freaking fish

5095.679 --> 5101.36
right if i wouldn't have freaking eaten

5097.92 --> 5105.32
it then i'd have nightmares about it if

5101.36 --> 5105.32
it wouldn't have been eaten

5128.0 --> 5131.44
net fish right right right

5137.36 --> 5141.759999999999
now i want barbecue

5139.679 --> 5144.4
oh it is kind of that kind of weather

5141.76 --> 5146.639
isn't it a bit too windy maybe maybe if

5144.4 --> 5148.879999999999
the wind died down barbecuing outside in

5146.639 --> 5151.92
that sunny weather

5148.88 --> 5151.92
that would be great

5152.0 --> 5157.12
but yeah the wind has got to die down

5154.0 --> 5157.12
otherwise it's just gonna

5158.159 --> 5162.5199999999995
come unpredictable with the barbecue

5170.159 --> 5174.48
and kill should not be put on display

5172.159 --> 5174.48
either

5177.679 --> 5182.36
i don't know about that look there's

5179.36 --> 5182.36
this

5185.199 --> 5190.638999999999
like i do get that some people

5188.32 --> 5194.159
would like to have a stuffed animal

5190.639 --> 5195.04
trophy of something they hunted right

5194.159 --> 5198.48
just

5195.04 --> 5200.719
don't like get a room that's completely

5198.48 --> 5202.718999999999
covered with that like

5200.719 --> 5206.0
like a hundred dead animals that you

5202.719 --> 5208.4800000000005
kill like that's [ __ ] up right but if

5206.0 --> 5210.159
there was like this momentous

5208.48 --> 5212.32
moment

5210.159 --> 5214.08
where like killed a bear that was about

5212.32 --> 5216.32
to like attack you all

5214.08 --> 5219.5199999999995
your group and your family yeah that

5216.32 --> 5220.88
would be kind of cool to have that stuff

5219.52 --> 5222.88
right

5220.88 --> 5224.400000000001
i wouldn't blame you

5222.88 --> 5226.96
but that's different right that's not

5224.4 --> 5229.36
you like oh i want a freaking stuffed

5226.96 --> 5231.76
animal i'm gonna just go out there and

5229.36 --> 5233.44
kill one just because i want it stuffed

5231.76 --> 5235.4400000000005
right that's

5233.44 --> 5237.759999999999
bad

5235.44 --> 5240.08
if it just happened to

5237.76 --> 5242.639
be in a certain moment when that just

5240.08 --> 5244.88
happens then yeah you might want to have

5242.639 --> 5246.4800000000005
a momentum for it you might want to have

5244.88 --> 5248.719
a memory

5246.48 --> 5254.48
and stuffing an animal

5248.719 --> 5254.4800000000005
can be like a good way to do that right

5254.88 --> 5259.52
just don't go like freaking collecting

5257.36 --> 5262.5599999999995
animals just for the trophies that's

5259.52 --> 5265.96
horrific that's psychopathic

5262.56 --> 5265.96
in my opinion

5277.6 --> 5282.2390000000005
you don't know how to give up meat rig

5279.52 --> 5282.2390000000005
back why

5283.6 --> 5287.52
that's weird how do you not

5285.92 --> 5289.84
why can't you give it up have you just

5287.52 --> 5293.96
not have you ever tried to just leave

5289.84 --> 5293.96
the meat out sometimes

5295.76 --> 5299.52
you don't

5296.88 --> 5301.6
like the thing is this entire

5299.52 --> 5304.639
meat replacement right well that's

5301.6 --> 5305.92
[ __ ] it's [ __ ] dude i hate meat

5304.639 --> 5309.92
replacement

5305.92 --> 5311.84
things i don't do that i just like i

5309.92 --> 5313.52
used to make everything with meat right

5311.84 --> 5315.52
i had my spaghetti

5313.52 --> 5318.56
with beef

5315.52 --> 5320.2390000000005
meat in there was it the meatloaf type

5318.56 --> 5323.92
thing

5320.239 --> 5325.919999999999
and one day i just left it out

5323.92 --> 5327.4400000000005
just like okay now i'm just not gonna do

5325.92 --> 5330.2390000000005
it with meat anymore

5327.44 --> 5332.638999999999
i did eventually like put a carrot

5330.239 --> 5335.28
a couple of carrots in its place to make

5332.639 --> 5337.92
it a bit more chunky

5335.28 --> 5339.679
and it's great i don't miss it

5337.92 --> 5343.6
i don't miss it at all

5339.679 --> 5346.4800000000005
i eat my spaghetti vegetarian

5343.6 --> 5349.6
right you don't have to replace the meat

5346.48 --> 5352.4
just try it out without meat sometime

5349.6 --> 5354.4800000000005
you'll find that it'll work great

5352.4 --> 5356.96
you don't really need the meat right

5354.48 --> 5360.08
it's often what keep what keeps people

5356.96 --> 5362.4800000000005
really in there is the taste

5360.08 --> 5365.6
the taste of it the influence because

5362.48 --> 5368.159
there's like a certain type of

5365.6 --> 5371.360000000001
i guess sort of hormonal influences with

5368.159 --> 5372.159
the with the uh

5371.36 --> 5373.44
the

5372.159 --> 5375.44
the gravy

5373.44 --> 5377.678999999999
that comes out of meat

5375.44 --> 5380.159
and that does some it gives you a little

5377.679 --> 5383.04
kick in a way right that's really what

5380.159 --> 5385.679
keeps people addicted to meat

5383.04 --> 5386.719
is that tasty effect that you can't you

5385.679 --> 5387.92
can't

5386.719 --> 5391.04
mimic that

5387.92 --> 5394.56
with fake meat it's impossible

5391.04 --> 5396.08
right but you don't need meat constantly

5394.56 --> 5398.8
i eat meat

5396.08 --> 5401.04
i don't even eat it every day though

5398.8 --> 5404.0
you see and it works great

5401.04 --> 5406.719
i like not eating meat sometime because

5404.0 --> 5409.6
in ways i noticed that

5406.719 --> 5413.04
i regenerate more when i sleep in a day

5409.6 --> 5415.679
that i haven't eaten meat it is

5413.04 --> 5417.12
if i don't eat meat for too long though

5415.679 --> 5420.719
then

5417.12 --> 5422.8
other things like start to decline

5420.719 --> 5425.44
so i do need meat

5422.8 --> 5428.56
it is good for me i just don't have to

5425.44 --> 5431.4
eat it every day and then when i don't

5428.56 --> 5433.52
then i have other advantages that

5431.4 --> 5434.719
non-meat eaters

5433.52 --> 5438.0
have

5434.719 --> 5439.84
you regenerate more quickly

5438.0 --> 5442.08
during sleep

5439.84 --> 5442.08
really

5442.239 --> 5446.239
all right but you do need it

5443.92 --> 5449.36
periodically

5446.239 --> 5452.638999999999
so like

5449.36 --> 5454.639
if you want something in between then

5452.639 --> 5459.12
try to eat

5454.639 --> 5459.12
meat like two or three times a week

5459.44 --> 5463.919999999999
and that's it the rest in between just

5461.84 --> 5465.92
not just don't do it

5463.92 --> 5468.56
do you eat kebabs no

5465.92 --> 5468.56
no i don't

5472.48 --> 5478.08
i don't eat anything that i don't make

5475.36 --> 5480.08
myself in my in the kitchen except for

5478.08 --> 5482.639
pizzas from the supermarket which are

5480.08 --> 5482.639
kind of good

5483.36 --> 5488.0
they're vegan by the way

5485.28 --> 5492.0
with weird fake cheese that works really

5488.0 --> 5492.0
well surprisingly i really like it

5496.08 --> 5501.12
but no like things like kebabs

5498.96 --> 5502.719
that you get like at a kebab store or

5501.12 --> 5503.679
whatever

5502.719 --> 5505.44
right

5503.679 --> 5507.679
like the kebab restaurant i don't go

5505.44 --> 5511.678999999999
there i haven't eaten that sort of thing

5507.679 --> 5513.92
in literally 20 years

5511.679 --> 5518.0
because since i switched to organic

5513.92 --> 5520.0
around 2006 2008

5518.0 --> 5522.96
i just completely don't go to

5520.0 --> 5524.159
restaurants anymore after that just

5522.96 --> 5524.96
never

5524.159 --> 5526.5599999999995
like

5524.96 --> 5529.6
never

5526.56 --> 5532.639
never go there anymore ever

5529.6 --> 5533.360000000001
right i yeah i miss it

5532.639 --> 5535.76
but

5533.36 --> 5539.36
that food's just not good anymore it

5535.76 --> 5541.04
doesn't work it i need organic food i

5539.36 --> 5542.5599999999995
really notice the difference right and

5541.04 --> 5543.679
if there's an organic restaurant

5542.56 --> 5546.320000000001
somewhere

5543.679 --> 5547.4400000000005
i might try that and that actually is

5546.32 --> 5550.799999999999
good

5547.44 --> 5552.799999999999
like when i went with my ex to germany

5550.8 --> 5553.76
there were some

5552.8 --> 5556.320000000001
they have

5553.76 --> 5558.639
pretty good supply of organic stores and

5556.32 --> 5560.5599999999995
all that in germany like even in like

5558.639 --> 5563.84
the backwaters

5560.56 --> 5565.280000000001
in where it's kind of remote

5563.84 --> 5568.88
but they had

5565.28 --> 5571.5199999999995
organic supermarkets organic restaurants

5568.88 --> 5573.36
and that was great i loved eating there

5571.52 --> 5575.76
and it wasn't even all that expensive

5573.36 --> 5577.5199999999995
right and then it's just like yeah this

5575.76 --> 5580.719
is it this is great

5577.52 --> 5582.360000000001
but that's super rare there i rarely

5580.719 --> 5586.56
in the netherlands it's

5582.36 --> 5588.239
[ __ ] expensive to eat out it's like

5586.56 --> 5590.96
everything is already expensive eating

5588.239 --> 5595.36
out is like expensive and

5590.96 --> 5598.679
my god with the whole lockdown [ __ ] it's

5595.36 --> 5598.679
like a disaster

5605.36 --> 5612.239
a beer in french fry yeah but i

5607.76 --> 5612.2390000000005
i fried my french fries myself

5615.199 --> 5620.32
it's much better so because it's organic

5617.36 --> 5623.04
potatoes it's organic olive oil i do it

5620.32 --> 5623.04
in olive oil

5624.88 --> 5628.8
we're getting all hungry

5626.56 --> 5632.0
i'm getting kind of hungry too i will

5628.8 --> 5634.0
get a pizza after this and a beer

5632.0 --> 5636.0
which are already in the fridge so i

5634.0 --> 5637.44
don't have to go out for groceries first

5636.0 --> 5640.48
i am kind of kind of hungry from all

5637.44 --> 5640.48
this food talk now

5640.719 --> 5646.88
went all over the place today

5643.6 --> 5646.88
it was a fun show though

5647.28 --> 5649.679
you're right

5655.92 --> 5659.639
hungry now yep

5675.04 --> 5680.08
eat eggs yeah lumpy gas in the vacuum

5678.719 --> 5682.4
yeah well there's

5680.08 --> 5687.08
there's a lot of eggs in mayonnaise

5682.4 --> 5687.08
you all know how much i love mayonnaise

5687.679 --> 5694.56
right so i'm not like oh be vegan we

5691.52 --> 5697.679
have to like the supposed

5694.56 --> 5698.4800000000005
climate change ideology

5697.679 --> 5701.76
oh

5698.48 --> 5704.718999999999
precious feelings type of veganism i'm i

5701.76 --> 5708.159000000001
am not on board with that i'm sorry

5704.719 --> 5709.84
i'm sorry if i offend

5708.159 --> 5712.48
i am kind of sorry about that because i

5709.84 --> 5714.56
do get it it's just that no

5712.48 --> 5716.5599999999995
no i'm not doing i'm not eating fake

fake meat

5716.56 --> 5721.76
i'm not gonna

5718.48 --> 5724.959999999999
stop myself from eating eggs at all

5721.76 --> 5727.360000000001
because i need it i am prioritizing what

5724.96 --> 5729.84
my body what's actually good

5727.36 --> 5731.36
for my body i'm prioritizing that over

5729.84 --> 5734.719
any

5731.36 --> 5737.839999999999
like ideal picture of what

5734.719 --> 5739.76
we want to eat right

5737.84 --> 5742.56
i'm just going with what my body needs

5739.76 --> 5746.2390000000005
and i definitely need eggs and i need

5742.56 --> 5749.1990000000005
meat periodically not every day but

5746.239 --> 5751.599999999999
like at least every week

5749.199 --> 5754.48
i basically eat meat

5751.6 --> 5756.639
well twice three times a week it works

5754.48 --> 5758.5599999999995
great for me it really does it works

5756.639 --> 5760.08
better i don't even need to eat that

5758.56 --> 5760.96
much

5760.08 --> 5762.639
right

5760.96 --> 5764.88
which is useful because i don't really

5762.639 --> 5766.639
have a lot of money so please do support

5764.88 --> 5769.28
me through the paypal and i will be

5766.639 --> 5771.679
literally more fed

5769.28 --> 5774.4
and it's not an exaggeration it's not a

5771.679 --> 5776.159
stunt it's not an advertisement stunt to

5774.4 --> 5778.96
to get you to support it's actually

5776.159 --> 5780.879999999999
literal right

5778.96 --> 5784.08
the amount i get from you guys in

5780.88 --> 5788.0
support really determines how much i

5784.08 --> 5788.0
kind of get to eat and smoke

5789.04 --> 5792.719
right i'm already very

5793.28 --> 5799.0
careful with how much i smoke because it

5795.28 --> 5799.0
does cost a lot

5799.36 --> 5803.04
everything's expensive in the

5800.639 --> 5805.04
netherlands

5803.04 --> 5807.04
right but yeah i do need continuous

5805.04 --> 5808.96
support i'm basically i'm going to run

5807.04 --> 5810.88
out of money

5808.96 --> 5813.36
this weekend

5810.88 --> 5814.400000000001
and that includes food money especially

5813.36 --> 5816.239
that

5814.4 --> 5818.719
so please do

5816.239 --> 5820.959999999999
support me through the paypal and then i

5818.719 --> 5822.4800000000005
can get through the rest of this month

5820.96 --> 5826.44
and then hopefully things will go a

5822.48 --> 5826.44
little better after that

5829.52 --> 5833.040000000001
