browsers okay B now yesterday was weird

513.24 --> 520.519
enough I left a little comment there in

516.479 --> 525.12
uh on yesterday's show but I mean the

520.519 --> 525.12
the whole timing yesterday was quite

530.08 --> 536.0400000000001
conspiratorial oh wow it's it actually

533.04 --> 538.3199999999999
now says yeah when I click on the video

536.04 --> 541.079
it says

538.32 --> 542.72
33032 but but hovering over it it

541.079 --> 546.12
actually does

542.72 --> 550.399
say 3 hours 30 minutes and 33 seconds

546.12 --> 554.0
now for some reason it it adds that

550.399 --> 554.0
second that's kind of

564.36 --> 571.36
weird 92 was part of eclipse cross was

568.279 --> 571.36

612.839 --> 616.6400000000001
hassle but I got there in

[Music]

651.55 --> 654.87
[Music]

658.24 --> 661.24
oh

688.959 --> 693.7199999999999
Earth

690.959 --> 696.4399999999999
debates everybody seems to love you over

693.72 --> 700.72
there why don't you just go watch

696.44 --> 700.72
that why do you have to hang around

701.95 --> 705.019
[Music]

708.76 --> 713.8389999999999
here okay I don't know what that is

711.04 --> 713.8389999999999
either debatable

718.24 --> 721.24
d

723.24 --> 730.639
but yeah initially I kind of wanted to

726.6 --> 730.639
skip today just not have a

732.6 --> 736.36
show but then I thought like nah I'll

735.24 --> 737.44
just have

736.36 --> 742.48
[Music]

737.44 --> 744.8800000000001
a a show and maybe keep it a bit

742.48 --> 748.0
shorter and we'll see what

744.88 --> 751.16
happens I do get a lot of enjoyment out

748.0 --> 751.16
of doing my show

754.12 --> 760.279
which is quite different from let's say

758.56 --> 762.959
a year

760.279 --> 764.8
ago where there would be like certain

762.959 --> 768.3599999999999
levels of pressure on

764.8 --> 771.4799999999999
it and I didn't really like

768.36 --> 773.44
that now it's much better thought you

771.48 --> 775.279
were a Healer

773.44 --> 778.12
now

775.279 --> 779.68
um

778.12 --> 780.88
no

779.68 --> 786.279
I got the

780.88 --> 789.639
technique and I apply it but I'm

786.279 --> 792.04
not on the same level just

789.639 --> 794.16
yet it's going to take a while I don't

792.04 --> 797.68
even know if I could really fully do

794.16 --> 800.6
that I have to figure it out as I

797.68 --> 803.199
go and I am trying to contact my healer

800.6 --> 804.9200000000001
after a long time there's a whole bunch

803.199 --> 808.12
of things that

804.92 --> 809.8
I need to check with

808.12 --> 812.86

[Music]

898.04 --> 901.04

901.86 --> 908.36
[Music]

905.0 --> 910.32
if ancient healing techniques actually I

908.36 --> 913.759
don't know if they're

910.32 --> 916.639
ancient I just know that I developed

913.759 --> 919.5600000000001
them I mean they can't be that ancient

916.639 --> 922.279
they're tapping into things that are

919.56 --> 922.279
potentially

923.16 --> 930.81
ancient arguably very ancient but I mean

927.12 --> 939.35
it's a reconstru

930.81 --> 939.3499999999999
[Music]

944.8 --> 951.88

1003.35 --> 1009.529
[Music]

1013.56 --> 1020.7589999999999
right it's not a matter of thinking it's

1016.36 --> 1023.48
it's a matter of figuring it out

1020.759 --> 1027.72
it's been a good act but I mean you're

1023.48 --> 1027.72
already like breaking at the seam

1029.94 --> 1036.919

1039.959 --> 1044.79
patience to hold on to an

1042.48 --> 1046.72
act and expand

1044.79 --> 1050.36
[Music]

1046.72 --> 1053.559
it to the depths that is really should

1050.36 --> 1053.559
if you were a real

1053.84 --> 1060.039
person but if the real tet gets Carried

1057.96 --> 1061.96
Away by their inner struggles and their

1060.039 --> 1067.76
inner stries then that's going to

1061.96 --> 1071.2
reflect upon all the acts and it is

1067.76 --> 1074.24
so yeah I mean you can keep going keep

1071.2 --> 1077.1200000000001

1677.12 --> 1683.619
weekend told you to take it easy on

1680.53 --> 1683.619
[Music]

1686.32 --> 1695.76
it right anyway I did check out the

1691.08 --> 1695.76
videos that you guys shared with me

1696.159 --> 1700.24
yesterday one was particularly

1698.559 --> 1702.84
interesting about

1700.24 --> 1707.039
[Music]

1702.84 --> 1709.519
the about the orphan trains in America

1707.039 --> 1713.559
this guy from from the video was saying

1709.519 --> 1719.24
that those orphans actually came from

1713.559 --> 1719.24
Iran that Iran has a lot of redheaded

1719.64 --> 1727.679
folk that is like part of Iran for a

1722.6 --> 1727.6789999999999
very long time that was unexpected and

1729.2 --> 1734.519
interesting yeah orphan trains part of

1732.12 --> 1734.5189999999998
early

1737.039 --> 1741.24
America post colonial

1741.279 --> 1748.36
America and he basically said like now

1744.6 --> 1751.76
those orphans actually were like taken

1748.36 --> 1754.4799999999998
from the Middle East which is

1751.76 --> 1754.48
fascinating

1754.94 --> 1765.01
[Music]

1767.039 --> 1772.279
idea

1769.36 --> 1774.799
like an unexpected twist that I didn't

1772.279 --> 1779.15
expect to to hear

1774.799 --> 1785.329
about so that was

1779.15 --> 1785.3290000000002
[Music]

1793.2 --> 1798.48
interesting although that makes the

1795.44 --> 1801.8400000000001
whole connection with the redheaded

1798.48 --> 1801.84
Giants little

1806.08 --> 1812.24
fuzzy like is there a connection or was

1808.88 --> 1814.3600000000001
it really another group that is

1812.24 --> 1818.88
separated like it's

1814.36 --> 1818.8799999999999
all makes it more confusing in

1819.73 --> 1822.809
[Music]

1824.799 --> 1831.519
ways trains with Asian people

1829.24 --> 1837.159
were they de bable

1831.519 --> 1837.159
D from what I heard they already liveed

1838.919 --> 1845.0800000000002
there like they were said the Chinese

1842.519 --> 1848.1200000000001
supposedly built the

1845.08 --> 1850.48
railroad in California and

1848.12 --> 1853.4799999999998
places so how are they going to come

1850.48 --> 1857.679
over the train when they're building the

1853.48 --> 1858.6390000000001
trail the trail the train tracks and

1857.679 --> 1860.3600000000001
everything

1858.639 --> 1865.8799999999999
that doesn't make any

1860.36 --> 1868.799
[Music]

1865.88 --> 1871.88
sense hello double

1868.799 --> 1874.44

1947.399 --> 1951.1999999999998
yeah the B

1948.399 --> 1953.559
no theoretically that might work like

1951.2 --> 1955.919
that the problem is it takes way too

1953.559 --> 1955.9189999999999
much

1958.76 --> 1965.8799999999999
time they didn't take like 50 years

1962.559 --> 1969.1589999999999
doing that they build it relatively

1965.88 --> 1972.519
quickly so they would have already been

1969.159 --> 1972.519
there at the

1976.84 --> 2003.1399999999999

2097.079 --> 2100.3590000000004
sensitive that kind of

2108.0 --> 2114.0
thing besides I bet that probably quite

2111.56 --> 2118.04
a few of those

2114.0 --> 2120.72
Chinese probably were not unwealthy they

2118.04 --> 2126.04
were probably kind of

2120.72 --> 2126.04
wealthy because of the tartarian

2126.64 --> 2130.52
trade I mean not all of

2134.52 --> 2140.48
them although probably a lot of their

2137.04 --> 2144.2799999999997
wealth would have been kind of like

2140.48 --> 2147.359
stripped when Colonial United States was

2144.28 --> 2150.76
formed they were probably

2147.359 --> 2153.24
burdened heavy with taxes and tax

2150.76 --> 2156.6400000000003
collectors just like taking their riches

2153.24 --> 2159.64
pretty much that may have

2156.64 --> 2159.64
happened

2161.56 --> 2164.88
allegedly I don't

2179.52 --> 2184.599
know not just their wealth well who

2182.64 --> 2186.7599999999998
knows maybe they killed off a lot of

2184.599 --> 2188.079
them I I don't know exactly the details

2186.76 --> 2191.5600000000004
of that it

2188.079 --> 2191.5600000000004
hist Tre is kind of vague about

2193.03 --> 2196.349
[Music]

2200.359 --> 2207.359
it there's a good chance a lot of them

2202.839 --> 2207.359
also just fled back to

2213.839 --> 2219.52
China wow man go you made a lot of

2216.839 --> 2219.52
effort for that

h

2725.96 --> 2728.96
ah

2735.559 --> 2743.7200000000003
right so let's do a little review I

2739.839 --> 2746.04
finished watching Spaceman

2743.72 --> 2749.0
yesterday Adam

2746.04 --> 2752.119
Sandler pretty much Solo

2749.0 --> 2755.119
movie very

2752.119 --> 2755.119
impressive

2755.92 --> 2761.52
very

2757.839 --> 2766.2799999999997
drama oriented it's like a space drama

2761.52 --> 2766.28
thing but it was really well

2768.04 --> 2773.72
done it was

2771.319 --> 2777.48
actually when you really think about it

2773.72 --> 2780.9199999999996
probably one of the best Alien Encounter

2777.48 --> 2780.92
movies that I've ever come

2781.2 --> 2787.839
across most sophisticate most

2785.079 --> 2791.7200000000003
sophisticated most detailed

2787.839 --> 2793.04
and most Trope avoiding in ways in other

2791.72 --> 2796.72
ways not so

2793.04 --> 2800.52
much was really

2796.72 --> 2804.2
good and it absolutely though did remind

2800.52 --> 2806.0
me a lot about the South Park episode

2804.2 --> 2808.1189999999997
about the Vatican

2806.0 --> 2809.88
law I

2808.119 --> 2813.0
mean

2809.88 --> 2814.28
like you'll figure that out very quickly

2813.0 --> 2817.48
when watching this

2814.28 --> 2820.96
thing but it is the overall theme in the

2817.48 --> 2825.4
whole movie is about

2820.96 --> 2827.2
loneliness isolation and workolic

2825.4 --> 2831.1600000000003
workaholism

2827.2 --> 2832.9199999999996
and it had some really good teachings a

2831.16 --> 2835.2799999999997
really good lesson in it I mean Adam

2832.92 --> 2839.359
Sandler again he's doing

2835.28 --> 2842.28
it he's taking science fiction medium

2839.359 --> 2845.2
taking it really

2842.28 --> 2849.079
serious and doing some

2845.2 --> 2853.24
good social education with it so I'm

2849.079 --> 2853.2400000000002
very impressed very impressed by

2854.559 --> 2861.559
it sounds like a relatable movie indeed

2857.599 --> 2864.7200000000003
yes absolutely in a in a pretty big

2861.559 --> 2864.7200000000003
way with

2875.559 --> 2880.4
me and I I think with a lot of people I

2878.839 --> 2883.92
mean

2880.4 --> 2885.359
isolation is a growing problem in the

2883.92 --> 2888.4500000000003
modern

2885.359 --> 2890.4
world with the internet and

2888.45 --> 2892.64
[Music]

2890.4 --> 2897.839
smartphones it is a

2892.64 --> 2900.5989999999997
problem and he's tackling that

2897.839 --> 2903.72
problem from within a virtual scenario

2900.599 --> 2903.7200000000003
and it's very

2903.92 --> 2910.28
impressive especially like just the

2906.8 --> 2912.559
emotional subtleties within it are very

2910.28 --> 2912.559
well

2915.76 --> 2920.599
done I'd give it like a solid n out of

2922.72 --> 2929.359
10 and it's also interesting

2925.839 --> 2932.48
because there there is just a mystery to

2929.359 --> 2934.44
it you don't know how the movie is going

2932.48 --> 2937.4
to end it's

2934.44 --> 2941.52
like the movie uses

2937.4 --> 2945.4
your Trope expectations against You

2941.52 --> 2948.319
Against The Watcher and that is

2945.4 --> 2950.88
absolutely fascinating you don't see

2948.319 --> 2954.799
that happen very often with

2950.88 --> 2954.799
movies so I'm really

2965.72 --> 2968.72
impressed

2971.76 --> 2976.3590000000004
yes debatable D I'm sure but the

2974.2 --> 2978.359
impressive thing about this movie about

2976.359 --> 2982.2
Spaceman is

2978.359 --> 2984.48
that it shows you that the isolation

2982.2 --> 2988.2
doesn't actually have to do with

2984.48 --> 2991.04
distance that it is psychological and it

2988.2 --> 2995.0
shows it in a very big

2991.04 --> 2998.64
way it's it's really to the point it's

2995.0 --> 2998.64
really on the core

3006.079 --> 3010.28
right but you be careful though it is

3008.079 --> 3014.0
not a it's not really a super happy

3010.28 --> 3017.4
making movie so if you're like in a sort

3014.0 --> 3017.4
of bad mood or

3017.48 --> 3021.2400000000002
whatever be careful with

3023.24 --> 3029.839
it or if you're like super happy

3028.24 --> 3033.5589999999997
like it might ruin

3029.839 --> 3033.5589999999997
it but it's really

3033.599 --> 3038.319
heartfelt

3035.96 --> 3041.92
it's if you've been

3038.319 --> 3044.92
like in a breakup or whatever it's it's

3041.92 --> 3044.92
going to be very

3055.64 --> 3058.64
helpful

3062.599 --> 3069.4
but I mean yeah it is like a space

3066.319 --> 3069.4
themed Alien

3070.079 --> 3076.96
Encounter giant therapy session

3072.839 --> 3076.96
basically in a very effective

3082.24 --> 3087.9599999999996
way and it isn't like so many space

3085.92 --> 3090.64
movies do

3087.96 --> 3094.799
just like oh something dangerous and

3090.64 --> 3094.799
scary just around the corner all the

3094.839 --> 3103.24
time also there is kind of a mystery

3098.0 --> 3103.24
built in into the movie

3103.319 --> 3109.68
that it's never truly resolved like

3106.599 --> 3112.96
whether the Alien Encounter is actually

3109.68 --> 3115.359
physically real in every way they leave

3112.96 --> 3117.88
it open it seems to whether it could be

3115.359 --> 3120.72
a giant hallucination which would still

3117.88 --> 3122.4
make it make

3120.72 --> 3126.3999999999996
sense

3122.4 --> 3128.079
it's like pretty well constructed it's

3126.4 --> 3130.48
very impressive movie and that's why I

3128.079 --> 3130.48
give it a

3132.52 --> 3139.96
nine also yeah the music in it is like

3137.24 --> 3141.8799999999997
really well done

3139.96 --> 3147.04
it's a lot

3141.88 --> 3149.4
of like bells and like just great space

3147.04 --> 3152.96
type

3149.4 --> 3152.96
ambient sounds

3153.24 --> 3159.2799999999997
and it's a very beautiful

3157.0 --> 3162.72
movie in many

3159.28 --> 3165.2400000000002
ways but it is a bit

3162.72 --> 3168.16
depressing just like going through it

3165.24 --> 3172.3999999999996
not like making you depressed not

3168.16 --> 3174.16
demoralizing but it is like it will push

3172.4 --> 3178.44
on those buttons a

3174.16 --> 3178.44
bit confronting with the

3180.319 --> 3183.96
it's like Adam

3181.68 --> 3186.7599999999998
Sandler pops

3183.96 --> 3189.319
up to an amazing performance every now

3186.76 --> 3193.6800000000003
yes well this is definitely one of those

3189.319 --> 3197.16
I mean I am like de mad

3193.68 --> 3200.0789999999997
props for Adam Sandler I mean I already

3197.16 --> 3202.16
had that perception about him like he

3200.079 --> 3203.76
would do that he just comes in a medium

3202.16 --> 3207.52
and then he just creates something great

3203.76 --> 3211.28
out of it with good really good morally

3207.52 --> 3214.4
sound life lessons and he's done it

3211.28 --> 3217.52
again prob potentially topped himself

3214.4 --> 3217.52
like I am very

3228.64 --> 3233.2799999999997
impressed I mean it keep it up and he

3231.559 --> 3235.44
might become like one of my favorite

3233.28 --> 3238.44
actors of all

3235.44 --> 3238.44

3325.319 --> 3329.859
for

3326.82 --> 3329.8590000000004
[Music]

3350.25 --> 3354.119
[Music]

3355.24 --> 3358.24
e

3365.52 --> 3372.48
right so yeah

3368.0 --> 3376.319
Spaceman turns out to pretty pretty good

3372.48 --> 3378.799
movie and it is hot though like I didn't

3376.319 --> 3378.799
expect

3385.24 --> 3389.799
it

3387.2 --> 3389.799
but it

3397.079 --> 3403.319
yeah but what makes it so interesting is

3400.2 --> 3407.64
that it is really

3403.319 --> 3410.799
about like the working ground with which

3407.64 --> 3415.4
they developed it is that it is kind of

3410.799 --> 3418.839
centered around alien intelligence like

3415.4 --> 3423.48
the actual mind of an

3418.839 --> 3427.319
alien and to not fall into the typical

3423.48 --> 3430.4
tropes and that is kind of fascinating

3427.319 --> 3434.0389999999998
because that is done very

3430.4 --> 3437.559
little doesn't happen a

3434.039 --> 3438.599
lot mostly when aliens become part of

3437.559 --> 3441.6400000000003
some

3438.599 --> 3444.2000000000003
movie they do the makers do have a

3441.64 --> 3447.52
tendency to just railroad them into

3444.2 --> 3449.8799999999997
certain type of tropes and it seems like

3447.52 --> 3455.7599999999998
that spec that

3449.88 --> 3455.76
specific thing was purposely avoided

3460.96 --> 3470.64
here and so in regards to like whether

3465.4 --> 3473.48
it's real or hallucination of the

3470.64 --> 3477.0789999999997
protagonist it makes it very interesting

3473.48 --> 3479.119
because it can both be like oh this is a

3477.079 --> 3480.599
mystery of the universe or this is a

3479.119 --> 3482.6400000000003
mystery of the

3480.599 --> 3485.96
mind

3482.64 --> 3485.96
and both

3486.48 --> 3492.599
work that is like yeah that that is

3493.92 --> 3502.039
astounding but it's done so well like

3497.079 --> 3502.039
they really made put in

3502.4 --> 3508.119
care to not put it on the nose

3511.839 --> 3518.68
to kind of like vaguely leave it open

3514.96 --> 3518.68
like is it actually

3519.88 --> 3524.2400000000002
real is yeah just very

3535.039 --> 3538.039
impressed

3542.98 --> 3546.15
[Music]

3561.119 --> 3568.76
schlocky hokey bad comedies

3564.839 --> 3568.7599999999998
what why you talking about

3576.319 --> 3582.64
de I mean his comedies are fun they're

3579.88 --> 3585.599
they silly Adam Sandler silly comedies

3582.64 --> 3585.5989999999997
are also

3587.96 --> 3592.799
entertaining so I don't get where you

3590.24 --> 3592.799
getting that

3594.64 --> 3599.8799999999997
from I mean

3597.0 --> 3602.4
you might yeah just even the older ones

3599.88 --> 3606.039
just go watch them back and they're

3602.4 --> 3606.039
really not as terrible as you

3614.75 --> 3617.82
[Music]

3620.37 --> 3624.199

any new thoughts or ideas about the Flat

Earth uh no not

3768.24 --> 3772.0389999999998
really many old

3774.839 --> 3777.839

[Music]

3798.86 --> 3801.989
[Music]

3804.76 --> 3807.76
on

3811.039 --> 3816.76
the looping earth right yeah well

3814.0 --> 3816.76
looping is

3817.76 --> 3827.6400000000003
simply The Logical consequence if the

3822.319 --> 3831.16
equator is a straight line or not a Act

3827.64 --> 3833.8799999999997
exact Circle within ukian space not a

3831.16 --> 3837.72
geometric Circle it's a straight line

3833.88 --> 3837.7200000000003
then looping is in

3838.119 --> 3845.039
itable it is The Logical consequence of

3841.559 --> 3845.039
the layout of the

3863.44 --> 3868.319
realm like a cylinder

3866.599 --> 3870.52
well you could think of it as a cylinder

3868.319 --> 3875.119
but I mean it's a straight

3870.52 --> 3878.96
line it's not a line that goes over a

3875.119 --> 3882.359
curve or like whether it's over a curve

3878.96 --> 3884.599
or through a valley it's a straight line

3882.359 --> 3887.4
if you move a straight line and you end

3884.599 --> 3888.839
up on an exact location on that straight

3887.4 --> 3892.279
line that you've been

3888.839 --> 3895.0789999999997
before there's only one way that

3892.279 --> 3897.64
could theoretically happen and that is

3895.079 --> 3897.6400000000003
there's a loop

3902.64 --> 3906.0389999999998
what is beyond the North in the

3906.64 --> 3910.0
South we don't

3910.24 --> 3913.4399999999996
know a

3913.88 --> 3919.4
barrier another

3915.88 --> 3922.359
realm there might be one other realm

3919.4 --> 3925.279
that is both north and south of us the

3922.359 --> 3929.92
same realm which would also mean a loop

3925.279 --> 3929.92
or that could be multiple Realms

3930.16 --> 3934.5899999999997
different a different realm to the South

3932.64 --> 3937.6389999999997
a different realm to the

3934.59 --> 3937.639
[Music]

3939.48 --> 3946.839
north which may then end up in a barrier

3943.88 --> 3946.839
or again

3946.88 --> 3953.7200000000003
Loop infinite Realms no there is no

3949.68 --> 3953.72
Infinity in physical reality that's

3954.64 --> 3957.64
illogical

3975.13 --> 3981.76
[Music]

3978.079 --> 3984.559
there's no Infinity in any dimension in

3981.76 --> 3988.3190000000004
any spatial Dimension the bable

3984.559 --> 3991.0
D I mean you could fantasize there is

3988.319 --> 3991.0
it's just

3994.599 --> 3997.7200000000003
that it

3997.92 --> 4003.4
shouldn't like any form of spatial

4000.839 --> 4005.279
Infinity would like

4003.4 --> 4010.279
severely

4005.279 --> 4014.52
break entropy like it would test entropy

4010.279 --> 4016.68
in a way that like

4014.52 --> 4018.52
is

4016.68 --> 4021.319
if there's Infinity in any way then

4018.52 --> 4024.799
entropy will like break the entire thing

4021.319 --> 4024.799
will break the stability of

4027.039 --> 4030.6800000000003
it very large yeah sure I mean there

4029.92 --> 4035.52
could

4030.68 --> 4035.52
be 32 other realm

4036.2 --> 4042.8799999999997
[Music]

4038.92 --> 4047.319
segments who knows that could be a great

4042.88 --> 4050.52
deal of other realms more than we'd ever

4047.319 --> 4052.5589999999997
be willing to even Explore it's like

4050.52 --> 4054.839
yeah we're going to explore all of them

4052.559 --> 4057.2000000000003
like one person's crazy enough to like

4054.839 --> 4060.64
over several

4057.2 --> 4062.52
lifetimes like go out and like yeah I'm

4060.64 --> 4066.359
going to go to the realm beyond the

4062.52 --> 4069.64
South and then like 200 years

4066.359 --> 4072.279
later a group arrives on a boat and

4069.64 --> 4076.5589999999997
they're like yeah we're the ancestors of

4072.279 --> 4081.039
that guy we explored like

4076.559 --> 4081.039
12 Realms and then it became too

4084.039 --> 4088.6400000000003
difficult

4085.599 --> 4091.1600000000003
like we just decided to turn back I mean

4088.64 --> 4091.16
that that could

4092.4 --> 4095.599
happen who

4098.56 --> 4103.0
knows

4100.6 --> 4108.56
32

4103.0 --> 4112.159
to what 2 to the 5ifth oh okay right it

4108.56 --> 4115.2390000000005
would also make it a total of 33 Realms

4112.159 --> 4115.239
which I thought was very

4130.279 --> 4133.56
fitting I mean if you're going to have a

4132.279 --> 4137.0
large

4133.56 --> 4140.1990000000005
number then why not 30 33 you know I

4137.0 --> 4140.199
mean that's pretty damn

4157.239 --> 4162.5599999999995
large right but what it would even make

4160.12 --> 4165.799
a realm segment what would make a realm

4162.56 --> 4168.719
segment a realm segment well that is the

4165.799 --> 4171.799
relation of the celestials to that

4168.719 --> 4175.64
specifically the Sun what makes a realm

4171.799 --> 4178.359
segment is that at the middle of the

4175.64 --> 4182.159000000001
realm segment there is an equator line

4178.359 --> 4185.759
there is a maxim of the

4182.159 --> 4189.3189999999995
Sun and there's an anti there anti

4185.759 --> 4193.839
equators antie equators would be

4189.319 --> 4193.839000000001
the separating factors of the

4193.92 --> 4202.04
realm because

4197.199 --> 4206.759999999999
technically it would all be one giant

4202.04 --> 4206.76
strip continuous strip of

4207.56 --> 4211.92
land

4209.6 --> 4214.88
right what makes it a

4211.92 --> 4218.04
realm would

4214.88 --> 4218.04
be the

4222.679 --> 4229.8
celestials and I'm going to assume

4226.32 --> 4232.719
at fir hand that the relation of the

4229.8 --> 4237.04
celestials and how

4232.719 --> 4240.96
they how they equate to the distance

4237.04 --> 4243.6
over the Realms is going to be equal but

4240.96 --> 4245.8
it could even be that there is in

4243.6 --> 4248.120000000001
inequity within the

4245.8 --> 4253.159000000001
celestials that there might be realm

4248.12 --> 4253.159
segments that are for example

4254.0 --> 4259.199
darker they might even be a realm

4256.4 --> 4261.159
segment where there's almost no light at

4259.199 --> 4264.678999999999
all or

4261.159 --> 4267.0
where the overall difference between the

4264.679 --> 4269.28
anti equator and the equator is very

4267.0 --> 4274.56
little where it's kind of equalized like

4269.28 --> 4274.5599999999995
all these variables could be there

4275.48 --> 4278.718999999999
too who

4280.28 --> 4287.239
knows different lengths of

4284.239 --> 4287.239
days

4293.96 --> 4298.4
maybe that would be quite surreal

4301.6 --> 4308.639
though it depends on how wide the realm

4306.36 --> 4308.639
would

4308.8 --> 4316.52
be right there's different

4313.239 --> 4319.799999999999
widths that means total distance from

4316.52 --> 4321.120000000001
east to west within the loop if those

4319.8 --> 4324.719
distances are

4321.12 --> 4326.199
different well then there would likely

4324.719 --> 4330.159
be a difference

4326.199 --> 4332.36
in the overall rotation speed of the

4330.159 --> 4337.12
celestials as

4332.36 --> 4337.12
well within the apparent celestial

4344.159 --> 4347.159
sphere

4347.56 --> 4352.92
false manipulations of Realm North and

4349.76 --> 4357.08
South no it's just completely made up

4352.92 --> 4360.4400000000005
the bable D Multiverse is just

4357.08 --> 4360.44
completely made

4370.48 --> 4375.599999999999
up it's like a mathematical based

4373.4 --> 4379.199
consideration that's gone completely out

4375.6 --> 4379.1990000000005
of control that's what that

4382.28 --> 4385.49
[Music]

4398.679 --> 4407.12
is right and what makes it what

4401.76 --> 4407.12
signifies Multiverse theory is that they

4407.239 --> 4414.44
not coexisting within the same

4410.719 --> 4419.44
space it is a another space that is

4414.44 --> 4423.12
somehow parallel to space that we know

4419.44 --> 4426.799999999999
you have to like switch Dimensions

4423.12 --> 4426.8
basically within the Multiverse

4430.04 --> 4435.76
Theory as far as I know there's only one

4433.199 --> 4437.5199999999995
physical existence there's only one

4435.76 --> 4441.159000000001
dimension that is

4437.52 --> 4441.159000000001
actually physical

4464.04 --> 4468.76
existence

4466.08 --> 4471.32
yeah multi World theories are red of

4468.76 --> 4476.159000000001
course they are it's all red

4471.32 --> 4476.159
herrings it's all heliocentric based red

4477.679 --> 4483.32
herrings right it it just gives you more

4480.52 --> 4483.320000000001
to dream

4485.4 --> 4490.96
about

4487.0 --> 4494.0
to bypass any need to actually try to

4490.96 --> 4497.0
physically explore it in that

4494.0 --> 4497.0
sense

4497.4 --> 4501.199
we live in three dimensions or is that

4499.8 --> 4504.1990000000005
four

4501.199 --> 4504.199
dimensions

4509.48 --> 4516.12
uh yeah we live in three dimensions but

4513.32 --> 4516.12
I mean our

4517.719 --> 4526.96
mind May at times touch the fourth

4523.96 --> 4526.96
dimension

4537.32 --> 4543.4
like our bodies are limited to the third

4539.88 --> 4546.4800000000005
dimensional rules but our minds our

4543.4 --> 4546.48
spirit technically

4553.92 --> 4556.92
isn't

4567.8 --> 4573.599
is time a dimension

4570.56 --> 4573.599
[Music]

4583.92 --> 4586.92
no

4589.75 --> 4592.92
[Music]

4598.6 --> 4604.400000000001
can we touch a for spatial Dimension

4601.84 --> 4604.400000000001
well not

4605.48 --> 4611.759999999999
physically we could be able to conceive

4608.12 --> 4611.76
of it though we could be able to

4612.52 --> 4618.639
recognize spatial traits that are

4615.44 --> 4618.638999999999
indicators of a fourth

4619.199 --> 4623.4
dimension what is time time

4626.52 --> 4634.080000000001
is the result of our

4630.6 --> 4637.08
Consciousness experiencing and

4634.08 --> 4637.08
perceiving

4641.36 --> 4646.839999999999
entropy time is the experience of change

4648.84 --> 4651.719
and time

4649.84 --> 4654.96
[Music]

4651.719 --> 4654.96
is say

4658.12 --> 4665.639
that the passage of time is basically

4662.96 --> 4667.719
cataloged through the

4665.639 --> 4671.84
stability

4667.719 --> 4673.84
and yeah the the stability the linear

4671.84 --> 4676.84
nature of

4673.84 --> 4676.84
entropy

4687.88 --> 4693.2390000000005
how do we measure with time you don't

4690.44 --> 4695.638999999999
you just measure with the passage of

4693.239 --> 4699.04
time time is not a

4695.639 --> 4699.04
thing just a

4703.76 --> 4706.76
concept

4710.76 --> 4717.88
so time does not change time is not a

4714.04 --> 4720.92
thing it's a concept that's the whole

4717.88 --> 4723.08
issue it's a concept that was reified by

4720.92 --> 4725.76
Einstein into a

4723.08 --> 4729.12
dimension and people's minds have been

4725.76 --> 4729.12
screwed ever

4730.199 --> 4735.879999999999
since there is no time there is only

4733.719 --> 4736.88
entropy

4735.88 --> 4740.52
and our

4736.88 --> 4740.52
Consciousness dealing with

4762.6 --> 4766.719
it okay

4783.28 --> 4792.44
local or Universal Universal Universal

4786.96 --> 4792.44
entropy it's how stable entropy

4793.639 --> 4796.639
is

4800.639 --> 4806.12
no that's a stupid question double zap

4802.88 --> 4806.12
you know that's a stupid

4823.639 --> 4826.639
question

4828.52 --> 4836.080000000001
right so time is basically the linear

4831.56 --> 4841.96
rate of change the linear rate of

4836.08 --> 4847.239
entropy things change at a consistent

4841.96 --> 4847.2390000000005
rate and that's why clocks are

4853.639 --> 4856.639
reliable

4859.6 --> 4864.04
right

4860.8 --> 4868.1990000000005
because if entropy was not

4864.04 --> 4870.199
stable then time or the perceived

4868.199 --> 4872.799999999999
passage of time would be different all

4870.199 --> 4876.32
over the place and you'd get weird

4872.8 --> 4878.4800000000005
scenarios like in interstellar where

4876.32 --> 4882.32
supposedly time goes differently because

4878.48 --> 4886.28
it's closer to a gravity

4882.32 --> 4890.5599999999995
well right as astrophysical concept Well

4886.28 --> 4894.48
yeah if entropy wasn't stable which it

4890.56 --> 4897.0
is then the passage of time would be

4894.48 --> 4899.28
different from one location to the other

4897.0 --> 4899.28
and it

4912.48 --> 4917.599999999999
isn't no time is not a thing thing it's

4915.239 --> 4917.599999999999
just a

4918.36 --> 4924.44
concept it's not a thing within physics

4921.679 --> 4926.679
debatable D and that is final that is

4924.44 --> 4931.12
absolutely

4926.679 --> 4933.04
final time does not exist in physics

4931.12 --> 4938.5199999999995
it's merely a

4933.04 --> 4938.5199999999995
concept can't Fair manipulate it at

4940.48 --> 4948.678999999999
all and how you even measure time is

4945.12 --> 4952.96
through entropy it is entropy that

4948.679 --> 4952.96
you're measuring time is just a

4973.44 --> 4976.44
concept

5005.69 --> 5008.82
[Music]

5033.44 --> 5036.44
for

5038.88 --> 5045.08
does that clear things

5041.44 --> 5049.08
up anybody still out

5045.08 --> 5049.08
there that's some good line of

5059.73 --> 5062.86
[Music]

5063.32 --> 5066.32
questioning

5073.48 --> 5081.919999999999
no no debatable de look you can use time

5077.76 --> 5086.0
but it isn't physics it's not a physical

5081.92 --> 5088.08
thing you can't very manipulate time

5086.0 --> 5092.239
there's only the passage of time and all

5088.08 --> 5092.239
you can do is just let it

5093.32 --> 5096.32
happen

5097.119 --> 5103.199
I mean you can use Concepts just because

5100.199 --> 5107.0
it's a concept doesn't

5103.199 --> 5109.678999999999
mean there's nothing there you can't use

5107.0 --> 5113.239
anything but it's a concept it's not

5109.679 --> 5115.08
physics it's not a a physical thing time

5113.239 --> 5116.0
is not a physical thing it's certainly

5115.08 --> 5119.639
not a

5116.0 --> 5119.639
dimension that was the

5123.32 --> 5127.719
point

5126.239 --> 5132.839999999999
right it's kind of like

5127.719 --> 5135.679
Mass within matter Mass it's just a

5132.84 --> 5138.360000000001
concept that is derived that doesn't

5135.679 --> 5141.32
mean that you can't use it but you can

5138.36 --> 5141.32
also use it

5143.0 --> 5149.04
incorrectly right and the same goes with

5145.6 --> 5153.2390000000005
time you can reify time into a something

5149.04 --> 5156.239
physical or a dimension and You' be

5153.239 --> 5156.239
wrong

5158.159 --> 5165.159
but it doesn't mean that you can't use

5160.92 --> 5165.159
time as a concept to do

5183.239 --> 5190.839999999999
things right but it is indeed fixed rate

5186.56 --> 5193.6
of change of entropy that is effectively

5190.84 --> 5195.8
what is what we perceive as the passage

5193.6 --> 5195.8
of

5203.36 --> 5210.839999999999
time can change Mass no you mass is a

5208.0 --> 5214.76
derived

5210.84 --> 5218.32
concept it is an extract

5214.76 --> 5223.0
a calculus based

5218.32 --> 5223.0
extract it's not a physical

5230.28 --> 5238.199
thing is it true over for distance as

5233.88 --> 5240.96
well yes distance is also a calculus

5238.199 --> 5240.96
base

5243.119 --> 5246.119
extract

5247.4 --> 5252.199
spatial when you're talking about

5249.6 --> 5255.6
spatiality you're already kind of like

5252.199 --> 5258.919999999999
going outside of the realm of

5255.6 --> 5258.92
physics it's

5265.8 --> 5271.0
complicated is anything

5268.52 --> 5273.56
real it doesn't mean that things aren't

5271.0 --> 5276.119
real it's just that physics is very

5273.56 --> 5276.119000000001
specific

5286.92 --> 5293.36
right a concept can apply to the real

5290.159 --> 5297.799999999999
world and can be used like a

5293.36 --> 5301.639
tool but that doesn't make the concept

5297.8 --> 5306.119000000001
physical it doesn't make it physics

5301.639 --> 5306.119
necessary necessarily

5310.3 --> 5313.579000000001
[Music]

5317.719 --> 5322.199

entropy

5332.679 --> 5338.6
uh danc

5335.239 --> 5342.28
is real in

5338.6 --> 5342.280000000001
physics and

5354.08 --> 5361.4
volume yeah see see how it all

5358.36 --> 5366.0
relates time is derived from entropy

5361.4 --> 5369.5599999999995
entropy mass is derived from density and

5366.0 --> 5371.4
distance is derived from volume see see

Earth is measured flat but is it

5397.32 --> 5401.759999999999
calculated yeah it's also calculated

5402.0 --> 5407.36
flat it's

5405.04 --> 5409.32
flat the Earth is

5407.36 --> 5410.88

distance and other measurements are

5498.639 --> 5501.639
dismissed

5502.36 --> 5508.799999999999
what I don't think anything is dismissed

5505.36 --> 5508.799999999999
other than faulty

5512.84 --> 5515.84
presuppositions

5529.92 --> 5532.84

5632.719 --> 5636.56
back

hey

5643.08 --> 5648.0
Richard Mouse can be measured as a

5645.84 --> 5650.4800000000005
resist no it can be

5648.0 --> 5651.93
calculated you can't measure mass you

5650.48 --> 5655.119
can only calculate

5651.93 --> 5655.119000000001

yeah we'll be good for the next

5722.639 --> 5725.639
time

5740.4 --> 5743.638999999999
okay debatable D that

5745.239 --> 5751.36
sucks I I doubt that that's real what

5748.76 --> 5751.360000000001
you're telling

5752.639 --> 5755.639
me

5760.96 --> 5764.96
I've never heard that happened to

5762.48 --> 5764.959999999999
anybody

5782.56 --> 5785.56
ever

5806.239 --> 5811.4
lucky you not that's yeah also just

5811.84 --> 5815.88
illogical it's never how that

5816.56 --> 5821.400000000001
happens the other way around perhaps if

5819.28 --> 5823.599999999999
you're like from a family that's really

5821.4 --> 5825.759999999999
like no we definitely super

5823.6 --> 5828.360000000001
old-fashioned Christian vales or

5825.76 --> 5831.639
whatever and like the Bible says the

5828.36 --> 5834.199
Earth is flat and like that's sin to say

5831.639 --> 5836.1990000000005
that it's a sphere and all of that and

5834.199 --> 5838.839999999999
then if you're like oh but I really

5836.199 --> 5840.839999999999
believe this then they might spank you

5838.84 --> 5843.92
or something

5840.84 --> 5846.96
sure but the other way around no that

5843.92 --> 5849.96
never happened that's never happened

5846.96 --> 5852.56
ever nobody ever spanked their kid

5849.96 --> 5857.4
because they said the Earth was

5852.56 --> 5859.84
flat they'd just be really worried about

5857.4 --> 5861.92
you they'd probably sent you to

5859.84 --> 5864.679
psychological counseling or put you on

5861.92 --> 5868.52
medication or something that's how

5864.679 --> 5871.719
globers respond to that I've never

5868.52 --> 5873.119000000001
heard of a parent actually spanking

5871.719 --> 5879.599
their kid because they thought the Earth

5873.119 --> 5879.598999999999
was like never ever heard of that

5897.199 --> 5905.36
ever are calculations okay

5901.719 --> 5907.04
now sure you can calculate stuff but I

5905.36 --> 5909.199
mean just because you can calculate it

5907.04 --> 5912.5199999999995
doesn't mean that it

5909.199 --> 5916.48
is physically real that it

5912.52 --> 5916.4800000000005
is a thing within

5930.0 --> 5934.84
physics right you just have to keep

5932.52 --> 5937.400000000001
straight what is

5934.84 --> 5939.92
what if you're going to calculate that

5937.4 --> 5943.119
mass of something well then you are

5939.92 --> 5945.679
deriving that information that you can

5943.119 --> 5949.0
use that doesn't make it physically real

5945.679 --> 5949.0
it makes it a derived

5952.08 --> 5958.04
concept flatness cannot be of course

5954.92 --> 5962.36
flatness can be calculated but

5958.04 --> 5965.36
flatness is a geometric

5962.36 --> 5965.36
trait

5987.199 --> 5993.799999999999
like flatness by itself isn't a physical

5991.239 --> 5996.919999999999
thing has to be something that is flat

5993.8 --> 5996.92
and then can be

5997.679 --> 6001.639
physical like Flat

6006.679 --> 6011.4800000000005
Earth hey Gary F

6020.44 --> 6027.96
yeah oh that's what I just said

6025.32 --> 6031.5599999999995
it doesn't make it real within physics

6027.96 --> 6035.4
hey hello hello Flat

6031.56 --> 6040.4800000000005
Earth is not

6035.4 --> 6042.638999999999
physics now knowing how the Earth is

6040.48 --> 6045.36
flat and

6042.639 --> 6048.679
contained you can definitely figure that

6045.36 --> 6051.5199999999995
out using physics but the Earth being

6048.679 --> 6055.639
flat itself is not

6051.52 --> 6059.4400000000005
physics it falls under

6055.639 --> 6062.2390000000005
geometry the flatness

6059.44 --> 6065.879999999999
aspect

6062.239 --> 6069.879999999999
yeah but that it has to be contained in

6065.88 --> 6073.400000000001
order to have gas pressure that is a

6069.88 --> 6076.88
something you have to derive from

6073.4 --> 6076.879999999999
physics natural

6079.92 --> 6085.599
law right figuring out how it's not

6087.159 --> 6090.92
moving also from

6110.239 --> 6116.119
physics didn't say it was physics

6113.76 --> 6116.119000000001
yeah

6116.56 --> 6124.080000000001
well I just had to emphasize that

6120.88 --> 6124.08
whether you said it or

6125.52 --> 6131.320000000001
not yeah but when you say calculating

6129.44 --> 6136.678999999999
something doesn't make it

6131.32 --> 6140.0
real no it doesn't make it an a thing in

6136.679 --> 6143.76
physics that's

6140.0 --> 6148.159
specific if you derive something as a

6143.76 --> 6150.76
concept it doesn't make it real in

6148.159 --> 6154.199
physics doesn't mean that you can't use

6150.76 --> 6157.4800000000005
the derived concept but you could also

6154.199 --> 6160.04
misapply it you could reify the derived

6157.48 --> 6162.759999999999
concept that you calculated into

6160.04 --> 6165.92
something that is in your opinion

6162.76 --> 6165.92
physics and You' be

6166.0 --> 6170.04
wrong that's where that comes

6172.119 --> 6175.119
from

6191.84 --> 6200.0
real in some other

6195.32 --> 6201.799999999999
subject physically real or

6200.0 --> 6205.52
conceptual you

6201.8 --> 6209.28
know hey in conceptual reality which is

6205.52 --> 6211.84
not reality anything can be reified you

6209.28 --> 6214.719
can make anything real by just thinking

6211.84 --> 6217.08
about it by considering it it doesn't

6214.719 --> 6217.08
make it

6232.04 --> 6235.04
real

6245.32 --> 6252.08
right you could think of the Earth being

6249.119 --> 6254.28
a globe by presupposing it is a sphere

6252.08 --> 6258.159
and then

6254.28 --> 6261.639
calculating the geometry into a

6258.159 --> 6266.96
sphere it doesn't actually make it a

6261.639 --> 6266.96
sphere but you think of it being a

6276.76 --> 6281.96
sphere re you don't know what reify

6279.48 --> 6281.959999999999
means

6283.32 --> 6288.719
what well

6285.36 --> 6290.009999999999
reification roughly

6288.719 --> 6291.32
means that

6290.01 --> 6294.639
[Music]

6291.32 --> 6296.199
you're claiming something to

6294.639 --> 6299.719
be

6296.199 --> 6302.96
real based on

6299.719 --> 6305.96
conception when it isn't when it isn't

6302.96 --> 6307.4800000000005
real so it's claiming

6305.96 --> 6311.0
something

6307.48 --> 6311.0
conceptual to be

6318.84 --> 6324.96
real it

6321.76 --> 6324.96
is oh

6327.239 --> 6334.678999999999
wow you mean the ball Earth luel

6331.88 --> 6337.08
C are you still insulted that I called

6334.679 --> 6340.679
you a Ballard and then you show up just

6337.08 --> 6342.84
to say it is proving that you are indeed

6340.679 --> 6342.84
a

6344.679 --> 6348.0
Ballard that's

6351.36 --> 6355.679
amazing a f good to see

6364.48 --> 6368.839999999999
you driving

6381.92 --> 6384.92
okay

6404.18 --> 6407.299
[Music]

6409.97 --> 6414.84
[Music]

6412.32 --> 6414.84
ah

6433.75 --> 6436.869
[Music]

6441.84 --> 6446.76
for

6444.239 --> 6448.04
reification in computer program okay

6446.76 --> 6450.2390000000005
that's

6448.04 --> 6452.76
interesting I haven't heard it in that

6450.239 --> 6452.759999999999
context

6455.04 --> 6460.76
yet could could

6457.08 --> 6463.239
you elaborate on that reification in

6460.76 --> 6467.84
computer programming I'm interested to

6463.239 --> 6467.839999999999
hear an example of that debatable

6471.84 --> 6474.84
d

6475.4 --> 6478.49
[Music]

6493.9 --> 6500.089
[Music]

6501.76 --> 6506.639
is

6503.76 --> 6506.639
can't bend the

6506.84 --> 6512.88
concept well you could conceptually but

6509.96 --> 6512.88
not in physical

6522.46 --> 6525.63
[Music]

6531.719 --> 6534.719
reality

6538.85 --> 6542.049
[Music]

6561.719 --> 6564.719
h

6571.28 --> 6577.04
okay I'm not sure I see the the

6573.719 --> 6577.04
correlation there the bable

6577.119 --> 6586.32
D C program code reice the memory

6581.239 --> 6586.32
address I I don't know how to think of

6591.639 --> 6594.639
that

6603.0 --> 6606.13
[Music]

6621.639 --> 6624.639
that

6632.84 --> 6638.4800000000005
right yeah Richard yeah it's going to be

6635.88 --> 6643.4400000000005
a bit complicated

6638.48 --> 6643.44
there like I'm already losing

6645.239 --> 6650.48
oversight I just know what reification

6647.76 --> 6650.4800000000005
in physics

6651.639 --> 6654.639
is

6655.679 --> 6662.96
the programming is its

6657.44 --> 6665.96
own giant soup of terminologies

6662.96 --> 6665.96
and

6679.199 --> 6686.239
is it's quite confusing how much like

6682.92 --> 6689.1990000000005
phrases and descriptions exist within

6686.239 --> 6691.678999999999
programming that kind of

6689.199 --> 6694.759999999999
parallel things like physics and all

6691.679 --> 6697.599
that except it is completely different

6694.76 --> 6701.04
it's just this

6697.599 --> 6703.28
gigantic SW yeah a

6701.04 --> 6706.36
gigantic amount

6703.28 --> 6710.28
of specialist

6706.36 --> 6713.199
words that seem like other things

6710.28 --> 6715.0
outside of that specialty field but it

6713.199 --> 6719.0
doesn't actually relate to that which

6715.0 --> 6719.0
makes it all very confusing to

6731.85 --> 6734.9890000000005
[Music]

6741.52 --> 6744.52
me

6750.42 --> 6756.17
[Music]

6772.239 --> 6774.44
oh

6801.44 --> 6807.159
h

6804.26 --> 6808.96
[Music]

6807.159 --> 6812.159
right anyway I hope you guys are

6808.96 --> 6816.199
enjoying this conversation it's I'm in a

6812.159 --> 6816.199
bit of a different type of mood as I am

6821.36 --> 6826.889
usually not super

6823.85 --> 6826.889
[Music]

6830.36 --> 6835.639
fluid but I mean the the conversation is

6833.28 --> 6835.639
kind of

6841.04 --> 6848.04
interesting first we had the movie

6844.04 --> 6850.48
review without any overt spoilers but

6848.04 --> 6853.079
it's it's intense it's

6850.48 --> 6856.598999999999
good it's a bit psychologically

6853.079 --> 6856.599
burdensome though watching

6857.04 --> 6863.639
it but as a concept movie was quite

6861.32 --> 6866.4
unique in ways I thought thought and

6863.639 --> 6867.88
maybe it's like oh but there are older

6866.4 --> 6870.799999999999
movies that have

6867.88 --> 6873.52
also done

6870.8 --> 6877.2390000000005
that and well I guess I missed out on

6873.52 --> 6879.280000000001
those then I just was very impressed by

6877.239 --> 6881.839999999999
this

6879.28 --> 6884.28
movie and now we're having just physics

6881.84 --> 6887.96
talk kind of went into the whole looping

6884.28 --> 6891.119
concept what could the realm confine be

6887.96 --> 6894.32
like and then on to like how physics

6891.119 --> 6894.32
actually is

6894.92 --> 6902.76
so I hope you enjoyed

6897.04 --> 6902.76
it yeah Gary F indeed robens it

6904.159 --> 6907.679
up thanks for

6915.56 --> 6921.1990000000005
that science

6918.32 --> 6923.28
jargon no debatable the thing about

6921.199 --> 6926.28
science jargon

6923.28 --> 6928.44
is it's very deceptive not because

6926.28 --> 6933.5599999999995
science is deceptive or

6928.44 --> 6933.5599999999995
physics it's because science

6933.639 --> 6939.679
is

6936.639 --> 6943.92
like the pseudo science

6939.679 --> 6947.1990000000005
the the religion of

6943.92 --> 6951.2390000000005
science is deceptive and it's creating

6947.199 --> 6954.598999999999
its own jargon and it is fundamentally

6951.239 --> 6957.879999999999
delusional and

6954.599 --> 6960.76
derailing of physics it's

6957.88 --> 6963.92
convoluting so there is basically a

6960.76 --> 6966.119000000001
parallel constructed religion that is

6963.92 --> 6969.119
called

6966.119 --> 6972.239
science that

6969.119 --> 6975.719
actually attempts to

6972.239 --> 6975.718999999999
negate physics

6976.639 --> 6983.4400000000005
knowledge and try to assimilate

6980.52 --> 6985.400000000001
mathematics and thereby reifying

6983.44 --> 6988.5599999999995
mathematics into physical reality it's

6985.4 --> 6991.119
been done already so many times what one

6988.56 --> 6992.04
of the most important examples being a

6991.119 --> 6995.0
black

6992.04 --> 6998.44
hole it's a mathematical concept that's

6995.0 --> 7000.8
been reified into physical reality

6998.44 --> 7000.799999999999
through

7002.36 --> 7006.36
astrophysics and then

7004.84 --> 7009.159000000001
artistically

7006.36 --> 7011.239
portray in movies which is the only

7009.159 --> 7013.32
place where it will ever

7011.239 --> 7015.839999999999
exist

7013.32 --> 7017.36
right but that's all because

7015.84 --> 7021.76
of

7017.36 --> 7025.079
science because of the religion of

7021.76 --> 7026.679
science not because of actual science

7025.079 --> 7030.04
which is the scientific

7026.679 --> 7030.04
method within

7031.679 --> 7040.04
physics so that thing scientism you

7037.0 --> 7042.159
could call it or the religion of science

7040.04 --> 7046.239
yeah they have made things very conf

7042.159 --> 7049.4
uted and complicated for us and the

7046.239 --> 7052.839999999999
jargon that those people that are

7049.4 --> 7054.799999999999
upholders of that religion have is very

7052.84 --> 7057.04
convoluted and

7054.8 --> 7060.599
confusing but it's because of all the

7057.04 --> 7063.639
reifications that happen because actual

7060.599 --> 7066.639
science itself and physics is

7063.639 --> 7066.639
not

7069.639 --> 7076.400000000001
convoluted it's very straightforward

7071.92 --> 7078.92
it's very logical and relatively

7076.4 --> 7083.36
simple it's not that

7078.92 --> 7083.36
elaborate it's very narrow and

7083.639 --> 7089.4800000000005
specific right but a lot of people don't

7087.159 --> 7091.44
like that so they basically convert to

7089.48 --> 7092.759999999999
the religion of Science and in the

7091.44 --> 7095.719
religion of

7092.76 --> 7099.0
science reification of the mathematical

7095.719 --> 7101.32
into the physical is common

7099.0 --> 7103.52
business that's the common way to do

7101.32 --> 7106.199
things and then that convolutes

7103.52 --> 7109.320000000001
everything convolutes the understanding

7106.199 --> 7113.36
of physical reality and that is part of

7109.32 --> 7113.36
the goal of the religion of

7118.96 --> 7124.64
science hey

7121.0 --> 7127.81
duper duper pun good to see

7124.64 --> 7127.81
[Music]

7131.04 --> 7134.04

[Music]

7191.04 --> 7194.04
e

7216.0 --> 7223.96
what geez duper that is a lot of

7220.96 --> 7223.96
money

7241.76 --> 7247.84
do I have a gaming keyboard no the

7244.56 --> 7251.400000000001
betable D it's an old Dell keyboard from

7247.84 --> 7251.400000000001
the 80s or '90s

7252.04 --> 7257.719
this keyboard is older than some of you

7255.32 --> 7257.719
in my

7268.0 --> 7275.119
chat hey duper don't feel bad it's your

7271.719 --> 7278.32
job your job was your job sounds like

7275.119 --> 7278.32
you got a good deal out of

7280.92 --> 7283.92
it

7292.22 --> 7295.68
[Music]

7298.5 --> 7301.539
[Music]

7310.84 --> 7313.84
that

7316.44 --> 7322.48
the keyboards are on the rise again yeah

7319.36 --> 7325.48
I know and and I called it yeah clicky

7322.48 --> 7328.079
clicky is the future what do you mean

7325.48 --> 7330.799999999999
touch bed oh I'm so

7328.079 --> 7333.36
futuristic no clicky

7330.8 --> 7337.2390000000005
clicky blind

7333.36 --> 7340.679
typing like how do you know you typed

7337.239 --> 7342.799999999999
it you can feel it you can hear

7340.679 --> 7347.159
it yeah

7342.8 --> 7347.159000000001
that's how you know clicky clicky is the

7352.13 --> 7355.499
[Music]

7360.76 --> 7368.360000000001
Future Part converter to stick it in no

7365.04 --> 7371.5199999999995
no no it just it

7368.36 --> 7374.839999999999
like the motherboard still has the the

7371.52 --> 7374.84
right type of plug for

7378.239 --> 7382.598999999999
it so no Port converter

7400.76 --> 7403.76
necessary

7460.719 --> 7463.719
is

7464.75 --> 7467.869
[Music]

7487.92 --> 7493.639
what are you talking

7490.639 --> 7493.639
about

7504.0 --> 7507.52
you just want to be useful like the

7506.199 --> 7511.04
others

7507.52 --> 7513.679
do hey that's not how this works duper

7511.04 --> 7515.92
you can't make a lot of money and be

7513.679 --> 7517.119
useful at the same time that's not how

7515.92 --> 7520.4
this world

7517.119 --> 7525.04
works you have to choose to either be

7520.4 --> 7527.36
useful or or be completely useless and

7525.04 --> 7529.679
make a lot of money that's how this

7527.36 --> 7529.679
world

7532.76 --> 7536.119000000001
Works sort

7536.84 --> 7543.1990000000005
of but I mean you can make yourself

7539.639 --> 7545.8
useful by I don't know donating some of

7543.199 --> 7548.558999999999
that to my PayPal perhaps it's just just

7545.8 --> 7550.639
an idea and you don't have to

7548.559 --> 7552.639
necessarily

7550.639 --> 7556.4800000000005
but

7552.639 --> 7556.4800000000005
it would certainly be helpful to

7570.48 --> 7576.558999999999
me c tril you fly oh that's not nice

7580.559 --> 7583.84
duper

7582.199 --> 7586.48
still

7583.84 --> 7588.159000000001
have well are you sure it is actually

7586.48 --> 7590.799999999999
because of the chemtrail it might also

7588.159 --> 7593.119
just be spring like Blossom hanging in

7590.8 --> 7595.92
the air also can give people

7593.119 --> 7598.159
headaches I've been having sort of a

7595.92 --> 7601.2390000000005
headache for a while now and there's

7598.159 --> 7605.638999999999
been very little camt Trails very little

7601.239 --> 7605.638999999999
of it there has been a lot of Blossom

7607.92 --> 7613.52
though oh

7610.52 --> 7613.52
something

7613.8 --> 7619.0
air conditioning yeah that will

7616.04 --> 7619.0
definitely be an

7640.52 --> 7643.52
influence

7670.44 --> 7673.44
e

7682.76 --> 7688.599
used to be tired walking to my job but I

7685.159 --> 7692.799999999999
don't feel tired anymore

7688.599 --> 7695.4800000000005
right yeah duper it also depend like at

7692.8 --> 7699.079000000001
your job was there a lot of like

7695.48 --> 7699.079
Wireless radiation going

7700.44 --> 7705.48
around did everybody have like wireless

7703.599 --> 7708.1990000000005
headsets and all that since you're

7705.48 --> 7710.799999999999
talking about people on the phone

7708.199 --> 7713.839999999999
because if it's the entire place is

7710.8 --> 7717.84
bathing in radiation like that that

7713.84 --> 7717.84
might also be a negative influence on

7719.92 --> 7725.88
you and a lot of those types of places

7723.76 --> 7728.639
especially like call centers and all

7725.88 --> 7729.84
that they are sometimes they even have

7728.639 --> 7734.559
like

7729.84 --> 7737.28
a wireless transmitter directly on the

7734.559 --> 7739.639
roof which is like a radar it just

7737.28 --> 7742.0
blasts everybody with with

7739.639 --> 7745.32
electromagnetic radiation all the time

7742.0 --> 7745.32
it sucks it's very

7746.239 --> 7752.558999999999
unhealthy there's a lot of computers

7748.36 --> 7754.92
yeah computers alone don't do that

7752.559 --> 7757.599
unless they're all wirelessly connected

7754.92 --> 7757.599
and not through

7760.36 --> 7763.36
cables

7767.76 --> 7772.280000000001
and since you're the network manager you

7770.04 --> 7775.599
should kind of know about these things

7772.28 --> 7779.0
shouldn't you like how is it connected

7775.599 --> 7783.4800000000005
is it all caed is it wiress how was the

7779.0 --> 7783.48
entire setup there or how was

7784.44 --> 7790.44
it 5G repeaters inside the building

7787.8 --> 7792.04
yikes yeah that would definitely be a

7790.44 --> 7795.32
negative influence

7792.04 --> 7798.04
cables okay that's good that's that's

7795.32 --> 7802.199
something duper

7798.04 --> 7802.199
that cables are definitely

7806.559 --> 7813.0
better how about headsets like people on

7810.679 --> 7816.32
the phone did they have wireless

7813.0 --> 7816.32
headsets or also with

7820.32 --> 7823.32
cables

7851.079 --> 7854.719
than next to an entrance where the

7853.0 --> 7857.159
people oh wow you can't even take your

7854.719 --> 7860.199
phones with you

7857.159 --> 7863.96
okay well when it comes to like

7860.199 --> 7867.04
radiation exposure that's good then that

7863.96 --> 7867.04
means less

7869.32 --> 7873.558999999999
exposure right yeah no problem

7880.239 --> 7883.239
duper

7883.559 --> 7887.079000000001
sounds like some super secret well it

7886.119 --> 7891.239
was a

7887.079 --> 7895.199
nondisclosure he had the nondisclosure

7891.239 --> 7898.159
agreement debatable D so please don't

7895.199 --> 7898.159
don't ask too

7900.28 --> 7907.679
much slapped a lot

7903.48 --> 7910.239
today yeah I bet you did I mean that

7907.679 --> 7913.2390000000005
typically happens after

7910.239 --> 7913.239
Easter

7932.599 --> 7939.8
debatable why are you assuming they had

7934.96 --> 7939.8
fiveg tracking systems in the building

7940.159 --> 7943.159
why

7946.8 --> 7952.679
there's no interference ifg you can't

7950.079 --> 7955.599
interfere with 5G with other telephones

7952.679 --> 7955.599
it doesn't work like

7958.04 --> 7963.199
that some people do take their FS okay

7960.96 --> 7963.199
that's

7970.119 --> 7973.119
weird

7984.639 --> 7989.599
right anyhow I think I'm going to round

7986.84 --> 7991.400000000001
out the show it's not been a super long

7989.599 --> 7992.2300000000005
