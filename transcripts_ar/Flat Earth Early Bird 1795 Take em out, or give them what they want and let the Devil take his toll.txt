bit Cloud

124.96 --> 131.72
covered still no rain yet no snow either

even though that has been

131.72 --> 135.64
predicted I'll

133.519 --> 136.76000000000002
check what they're going to be saying

135.64 --> 138.92
right

136.76 --> 141.72
now you can still see a little bit of

138.92 --> 144.83999999999997
Blue Sky through the clouds but yeah

141.72 --> 144.84
it's not a

145.4 --> 148.61
[Music]

148.76 --> 151.76
lot

152.239 --> 157.4
ah hello here we go again first in chat

155.44 --> 159.04
good to see you we had slow snow last

157.4 --> 162.04
night

159.04 --> 164.64
hm well if there was snow last night

162.04 --> 166.67999999999998
then I didn't notice it must have been

164.64 --> 168.54999999999998
like after I went to bed then more like

166.68 --> 171.8
in the morning so

168.55 --> 177.76000000000002
[Music]

171.8 --> 177.76000000000002
uh temperature 7 I mean 7 3°

178.76 --> 187.35999999999999
C

180.959 --> 187.36
it says snow or something so we'll

188.84 --> 195.04
see yeah definitely minus one at night

192.319 --> 195.04
I've noticed

197.319 --> 205.879
that although the the bowl of water

201.0 --> 205.879
is not frozen anymore like it was

208.159 --> 212.439
yesterday mostly melted now

211.14 --> 216.07999999999998
[Music]

212.439 --> 216.07999999999998
right still very

220.48 --> 225.84
cold right so

222.76 --> 228.04
yeah Q the treatment yesterday was a

225.84 --> 231.68
blast but it was so

228.04 --> 235.159
late it it kept running like past 4 my

231.68 --> 237.72
time so but I still kept watching it it

235.159 --> 237.72
was really

238.68 --> 241.68
funny

243.0 --> 251.48
I mean fight to Flat Earth is

247.0 --> 255.0
just he's gone the Plaid as they would

251.48 --> 258.479
say it's going into

255.0 --> 260.959
overdrive of trying to creatively put

258.479 --> 263.479
the globe model back together again like

260.959 --> 263.479
a Humpty

265.12 --> 270.44
Dumpty and he's being pretty creative at

267.6 --> 272.12
it I mean like

270.44 --> 273.32
fight the Flat Earth is getting my

272.12 --> 275.8
Ballwin

273.32 --> 278.32
enthusiastic and if you noticed me in

275.8 --> 279.32
chat of qy live yesterday you you would

278.32 --> 283.36
have

279.32 --> 285.24
known like you would have seen because I

283.36 --> 288.16
was trying to figure out like I think I

285.24 --> 290.36
finally know what gravity

288.16 --> 294.08000000000004
is I'll tell

290.36 --> 297.12
you hello Tera 306 good to see you Tech

294.08 --> 297.12
clutch good to see

297.52 --> 301.56
you but uh

302.16 --> 304.8
yeah

305.32 --> 311.479
apparently I was just like continuing on

307.919 --> 313.71999999999997
this idea of the non force of gravity

311.479 --> 316.24
creating the force of

313.72 --> 317.12
gravity or and if the proof of that

316.24 --> 321.319
would

317.12 --> 324.52
be gravitational waves well

321.319 --> 328.47900000000004
then what's the medium for the

324.52 --> 332.71999999999997
gravitational waves right because it's a

328.479 --> 336.52
wave well it's gravity of

332.72 --> 339.28000000000003
course gravity is the medium for the

336.52 --> 341.56
gravitational

339.28 --> 345.19899999999996
wave just like

341.56 --> 348.96
gravity is the non force that

345.199 --> 351.72
causes the force of gravity see it all

348.96 --> 351.71999999999997
makes sense

357.4 --> 362.52
now it's like two parallel

364.0 --> 368.639
circles right

366.199 --> 371.44
anyway maybe this this is still too

368.639 --> 371.44
early for you

379.039 --> 382.039
guys

383.85 --> 389.91

418.4 --> 421.4
that's

427.919 --> 434.15999999999997
fine on this end ah okay

430.84 --> 435.919
good video freezing is stopped too for

434.16 --> 438.319
some reason

435.919 --> 440.479
so I don't know why that sort of thing

438.319 --> 443.12
happens oh there it freezes again oh

440.479 --> 445.479
maybe it just likes weird poses of me

443.12 --> 448.199
every time I go into a weird pose it

445.479 --> 448.199
just freezes

448.319 --> 451.319
up

453.24 --> 455.919
I don't know

463.159 --> 469.599
why PE we must really put a lot of time

466.479 --> 473.4
thinking on those words

469.599 --> 473.4
no not a lot of

476.919 --> 483.96
time but I mean Q's heard a lot lot of

479.599 --> 487.68
swearing in his day to like pick from to

483.96 --> 487.68
pick from strategies of

492.199 --> 496.199
approach hey Dan good to see

502.199 --> 506.72
you okay I'm going to close that door

[Music]

567.519 --> 571.12
be welcome

571.24 --> 579.46
you're just surprised based on

574.55 --> 579.4599999999999
[Music]

581.64 --> 586.88
what I mean what else is little old

584.04 --> 586.88
Arwin going to be

598.12 --> 601.12
doing

605.399 --> 610.92
right anyway I do have an Illuminati C

608.16 --> 613.279
here looking forward to

610.92 --> 616.16
that I mean when it's this cold you

613.279 --> 621.399
really got to have something like

616.16 --> 621.399
that also got a turmeric coffee on

621.87 --> 625.539
[Music]

628.04 --> 631.04
standby

632.16 --> 638.04
actually should I put this

635.21 --> 640.48
[Music]

638.04 --> 642.92
back yeah I should put this back in the

640.48 --> 647.6800000000001
oven for a

642.92 --> 647.68
bit just a little bit be right

658.04 --> 661.04
back

687.959 --> 690.959
for

701.78 --> 704.99
[Music]

706.399 --> 710.48
all right so yeah J do I know you from

710.6 --> 719.399
somewhere you know about me I don't know

715.24 --> 723.36
you wow second I come back camera starts

719.399 --> 723.36
freezing again what why

728.72 --> 737.76
why seeing this movie last

733.199 --> 740.76
night All Quiet on the Western

737.76 --> 740.76
Front

744.72 --> 750.88
okay oh you saw a part of it okay

753.639 --> 761.48
cool yeah J but the thing is I still

757.839 --> 764.8800000000001
want you seem to know me I there seem to

761.48 --> 768.12
be a lot of people that know me yet very

764.88 --> 774.88
people that actually talk to

768.12 --> 774.88
me so I find that generally a bit

777.16 --> 781.48
frustrating isn't that a very very old

779.68 --> 787.519
movie

781.48 --> 793.48
what well teret wrote 2022 next to that

787.519 --> 793.48
so that's probably not a very old movie

797.26 --> 800.51
[Music]

801.639 --> 804.639
clutch

807.16 --> 816.4399999999999
what 96

810.32 --> 816.44
7 why did you write the 2022 next to it

817.839 --> 825.72
then is 2022 actually in the title as in

822.48 --> 825.72
the oh in the

827.36 --> 830.36
future

836.0 --> 839.08
what

837.759 --> 841.72
ah

839.08 --> 844.9590000000001
[Music]

841.72 --> 847.9590000000001
you're not making this less

844.959 --> 847.959
complicated

851.32 --> 858.24
teret yeah so the movie is from

854.68 --> 858.2399999999999
2022 not the

862.92 --> 866.88
70s thank you for that link

867.68 --> 870.68
steamy

897.12 --> 903.48
why did you ask 9070 tet what the hell

901.8 --> 907.92
does that had to do with

903.48 --> 909.9590000000001
anything oh the older one

907.92 --> 913.88
oh

909.959 --> 913.88
okay so it's a

916.36 --> 921.88
remake okay well Hollywood does that a

918.88 --> 924.519
lot so that makes sense

921.88 --> 927.6
then

924.519 --> 930.6
9030 version

927.6 --> 930.6
wow

932.279 --> 936.199

be right

987.519 --> 990.519
back

1015.24 --> 1023.04

[Music]

1065.24 --> 1069.919
chilly had a shower yesterday yeah

1068.08 --> 1073.12
that's why my hair is loose

1069.919 --> 1075.6000000000001
again and

1073.12 --> 1080.2399999999998
just it's not even like oh I feel dirty

1075.6 --> 1082.3999999999999
it's just like holy [ __ ] warm water

1080.24 --> 1086.32
like I was it was very difficult for me

1082.4 --> 1086.3200000000002
to get back out of that

1086.48 --> 1091.84
shower like in the end I just like what

1089.72 --> 1094.88
do you mean I add cold water it's just

1091.84 --> 1097.0
like nope I'm just going straight under

1094.88 --> 1099.72
the the hot

1097.0 --> 1104.559
stream just warming

1099.72 --> 1104.559
up it was pretty damn cold last

1104.83 --> 1108.62
[Music]

1107.32 --> 1116.72
night

1108.62 --> 1116.7199999999998
[Music]

1137.32 --> 1140.32
h

1141.64 --> 1146.0800000000002
right so yeah I didn't really have any

1143.36 --> 1150.039
specific subjects in mind

1146.08 --> 1150.039
to a lot of Dreams

1154.64 --> 1164.5590000000002
again that is an interesting

1157.64 --> 1164.5590000000002
thing that when it like freezes I dream

1165.32 --> 1168.84
more might also have something to do

1168.039 --> 1171.08
that

1168.84 --> 1173.48
like even when it freezes I keep my

1171.08 --> 1176.08
window open it's like yeah I need that

1173.48 --> 1177.679
fresh air like I don't know or I mean I

1176.08 --> 1180.6
don't

1177.679 --> 1184.0
care even if it's like super

1180.6 --> 1187.8799999999999
cold if it's really super cold then I'd

1184.0 --> 1191.88
like leave the window open in like a

1187.88 --> 1193.7600000000002
very small way and now if it was bad

1191.88 --> 1197.4
enough and everything would be like

1193.76 --> 1200.679
complete iced over terrible like minus

1197.4 --> 1204.0800000000002
20 yeah then I'd probably keep my window

1200.679 --> 1207.52
closed but uh overall I need that fresh

1204.08 --> 1210.8799999999999
air badly but and when I get

1207.52 --> 1214.9189999999999
it when it's winter and it's like

1210.88 --> 1217.6000000000001
freezing like I do like get dreams from

1214.919 --> 1218.679
that like the dreams become more Vivid

1217.6 --> 1221.6789999999999
or

1218.679 --> 1221.679
something

1223.44 --> 1230.159
visually H you do that too Jake

1227.159 --> 1230.159
right

1231.44 --> 1236.559
yeah I just started doing that ever

1234.08 --> 1238.8799999999999
since I really became a

1236.559 --> 1240.76
smoker cuz especially in the beginning

1238.88 --> 1243.679
like I really needed it like in the

1240.76 --> 1244.8799999999999
beginning I had more trouble dealing

1243.679 --> 1248.3600000000001
with

1244.88 --> 1250.679
smoking like the influence of it than I

1248.36 --> 1250.6789999999999
do

1251.679 --> 1256.679
now so I really needed that fresh air

1254.6 --> 1259.36
back then otherwise I could like almost

1256.679 --> 1261.679
feel like I like like I would get

1259.36 --> 1266.24
asmatic or something

1261.679 --> 1269.919
but sometimes and that and that really

1266.24 --> 1274.72
never ever happens to me anymore just

1269.919 --> 1274.72
for the record that was really back

1280.039 --> 1286.6
then right but I just had as a habit

1284.279 --> 1289.24
like fresh air I need the fresh air my

1286.6 --> 1290.799
mother also had issues with it but she

1289.24 --> 1294.84
was

1290.799 --> 1298.1589999999999
like allergic to colds so like she would

1294.84 --> 1301.08
not keep the window open if it was

1298.159 --> 1304.8400000000001
freezing and then the next day complain

1301.08 --> 1306.36
basically about like feeling short on

1304.84 --> 1308.84
breath and all

1306.36 --> 1311.84
that oh my mother would always find a

1308.84 --> 1314.84
way to complain about absolutely every

1311.84 --> 1314.84
detail

1315.72 --> 1320.4
so I guess all of that contribut did

1318.32 --> 1324.039
this life decision like yeah I'm

1320.4 --> 1325.5590000000002
sleeping with the window open

1324.039 --> 1328.2
forever

1325.559 --> 1330.6789999999999
like I'll keep that thing closed but

1328.2 --> 1336.52
then when I go into bed I open it up and

1330.679 --> 1336.52
then quickly get in and and it works

1337.2 --> 1343.159
anyway do my roommates ever complain

1340.0 --> 1346.159
about my smoking uh yeah some of them

1343.159 --> 1349.4
have it's especially when it gets really

1346.159 --> 1351.679
windy like this there's storm outside or

1349.4 --> 1352.799
whatever or it's raining and and and

1351.679 --> 1356.3600000000001
it's

1352.799 --> 1358.799
windy then like the wind kind of like

1356.36 --> 1361.4799999999998
pushes into the room and then that

1358.799 --> 1364.32
causes the smoke to basically like just

1361.48 --> 1366.24
go straight into the hallway not really

1364.32 --> 1369.6399999999999
thick smoke but the smell of it still

1366.24 --> 1369.64
and yeah they find that

1370.72 --> 1375.679
annoying but that only really happens

1373.12 --> 1378.0
when there's like a storm

1375.679 --> 1380.48
out other than that no they don't

1378.0 --> 1380.48
complain at

1385.679 --> 1388.679
all

1391.6 --> 1395.76
right I'm going to continue

1399.48 --> 1402.509
[Music]

1404.2 --> 1409.88
this I won my

1406.88 --> 1409.88
coffee

1410.88 --> 1416.7600000000002
but I think I'm going to just keep doing

1413.44 --> 1419.0800000000002
this doing the T coffee like this not at

1416.76 --> 1422.679
the start of the show as I used to do it

1419.08 --> 1425.9189999999999
on a bare stomach which is not good

1422.679 --> 1425.919
can't handle that a lot of the

1430.76 --> 1434.279
time but like

1436.88 --> 1439.88
halfway

1445.28 --> 1448.43

1451.52 --> 1456.799
oh you got a wood heater in indoors

1454.12 --> 1456.799
clutch

1458.159 --> 1464.919
H I wish I had like an

1461.6 --> 1466.799
oldfashioned wood stove with like a

1464.919 --> 1469.039
good

1466.799 --> 1471.08
chimney

1469.039 --> 1473.32
I mean it's like it technically way too

1471.08 --> 1477.799
dangerous like that they wouldn't allow

1473.32 --> 1481.279
that like in building like this

1477.799 --> 1483.32
probably but it would be pretty nice

1481.279 --> 1486.919
like I've seen a lot of videos out there

1483.32 --> 1491.6789999999999
like how to build like clean

1486.919 --> 1493.88
burning stoves for heat or whatever and

1491.679 --> 1496.96
I'm really fat I'm

1493.88 --> 1499.72
like I want to try out one more of these

1496.96 --> 1503.88
like basic heat stove techniques like

1499.72 --> 1505.72
I've always been into fire I love fire I

1503.88 --> 1509.6000000000001
have fireproof

1505.72 --> 1512.72
hands if I focus which is

1509.6 --> 1515.0
amazing like I'm that guy that's just

1512.72 --> 1517.08
like always taking care of the fire when

1515.0 --> 1521.32
there's

1517.08 --> 1521.32
like like a fire everybody's

1521.399 --> 1526.6789999999999
around and I like to show off by

1523.76 --> 1529.679
literally picking hot coals out of the

1526.679 --> 1529.679
fire with my hand

1530.039 --> 1537.52
like as it's burning and then like just

1533.399 --> 1537.52
like oh look just pick the hot

1538.159 --> 1544.7
coal cuz it's fun and everybody some

1541.52 --> 1547.559
people get freaked out by

1544.7 --> 1550.3990000000001
[Music]

1547.559 --> 1552.799
that but I'm generally very interested

1550.399 --> 1556.2399999999998
in fire techniques and all that and

1552.799 --> 1560.1589999999999
there's great videos about

1556.24 --> 1561.64
that Fireproof proof hands yes also very

1560.159 --> 1564.44
handy when you're a

1561.64 --> 1567.72
Goldsmith I mean it's not literally

1564.44 --> 1571.3990000000001
fireproof but very fire resistant and

1567.72 --> 1574.159
it's even like Burns right Burns can be

1571.399 --> 1577.08
very painful burn

1574.159 --> 1579.3200000000002
wounds they heal up pretty damn quick on

1577.08 --> 1579.32
my

1579.64 --> 1586.279
hands and fire just hurts

1583.12 --> 1589.6
less I don't know what it is but it's

1586.279 --> 1589.6
been very handy as it goes

1621.52 --> 1630.039

but yeah yes it is

1630.039 --> 1636.08

smoke before I start to do

1682.76 --> 1690.08
anything including the

show and that definitely makes that

1690.08 --> 1695.96
happen

1692.559 --> 1698.08
so now I don't know if it's like more

1695.96 --> 1702.24
healthy to do it straight away in the

1698.08 --> 1704.48
morning or just leave it until later I'm

1702.24 --> 1704.48

1756.159 --> 1761.7600000000002
in the summer when it's

1758.76 --> 1764.48
hot because like the the vitamins and

1761.76 --> 1769.32
all that they just burst forth and I

1764.48 --> 1769.32
absorb it better in the summer I

1772.44 --> 1778.2
noticed in the winter I'm not so fruity

1775.36 --> 1781.7199999999998
I'm more about the fats I'm like yeah

this [ __ ] oh yeah thought it my internet

1821.36 --> 1826.32
had cut or something but I

1823.72 --> 1830.88
refreshed rwin is only fruity in the

1826.32 --> 1830.8799999999999
summer like as in eating

1832.2 --> 1837.1200000000001
fruit like apples I like apples

1837.559 --> 1842.9189999999999
bananas I would say like grapefruit and

1840.2 --> 1847.039
oranges but I don't really I

1842.919 --> 1847.039
I I get the

1847.72 --> 1853.96
juice get the juice high quality in a

1850.679 --> 1856.24
bottle like I like you can like or

1853.96 --> 1859.159
grapefruit juice you can like keep that

1856.24 --> 1861.919
stuff forever

1859.159 --> 1863.3200000000002
amazing but an actual grapefruit will

1861.919 --> 1867.48
dry out

1863.32 --> 1867.48
eventually but not if you keep it in a

1868.279 --> 1875.72
bottle right so yeah red orange juice

1872.559 --> 1879.279
blood orange juice uh grapefruit juice

1875.72 --> 1880.6000000000001
love that stuff especially in the summer

1879.279 --> 1885.48
just

1880.6 --> 1887.6789999999999
amazing uh like apples

1885.48 --> 1890.3990000000001
bananas I

1887.679 --> 1893.919
I just sometimes sometimes I like take

1890.399 --> 1897.9599999999998
one I like like take two or three in a

1893.919 --> 1900.72
summer and then I'm like done with

1897.96 --> 1903.08
it unless it's like I'm going to make

1900.72 --> 1904.919
like a fruit yogurt salad and then there

1903.08 --> 1907.76
is always if there's yogurt involved

1904.919 --> 1907.76
then banana is

1909.679 --> 1917.279
great also I like tangerines the little

1913.6 --> 1919.399
small oranges I love those when they're

1917.279 --> 1921.799
there and they have of a good kind

1919.399 --> 1922.9189999999999
because sometimes tangerin can like be

1921.799 --> 1925.76
really

1922.919 --> 1928.3990000000001
shitty and the peels all stuck to it and

1925.76 --> 1931.24
you always rip it open yeah whatever or

1928.399 --> 1932.9599999999998
they're all dried out but if there's

1931.24 --> 1935.24
like a good batch of tangerines those

1932.96 --> 1935.24
are

1935.76 --> 1940.559
awesome uh another

1944.12 --> 1949.84
fruit well that's it really I keep it

1947.519 --> 1949.84
kind of

1955.159 --> 1958.919
simple like I like some

1960.2 --> 1965.3990000000001
berries right like

1963.44 --> 1967.919
uh

1965.399 --> 1970.1589999999999
blueberries but but like I really only

1967.919 --> 1972.6390000000001
like that when it's super hot then it's

1970.159 --> 1972.6390000000001

[Music]

2558.92 --> 2566.28
is my show is kind of weird right I

2563.16 --> 2568.7999999999997
mean I started out there getting to Mar

2566.28 --> 2575.1600000000003
coffee then I literally got really sick

2568.8 --> 2577.119
of it like actually sick from it then I

2575.16 --> 2581.92
quit

2577.119 --> 2583.52
and then at like years later like huh

2581.92 --> 2586.16
let's have it

2583.52 --> 2590.48
halfway and now it's like the best thing

2586.16 --> 2590.48
ever it's exactly the same to Mar

2593.319 --> 2599.52
coffee but maybe it's a new me maybe I'm

2597.119 --> 2602.76
the one that is like transformed so it

2599.52 --> 2608.04
just works differently

2602.76 --> 2611.28
now I don't drink alcohol anymore

2608.04 --> 2613.2
I think I overall don't stress myself

2611.28 --> 2616.4
out as

2613.2 --> 2618.64
much like yeah I'm still technically

2616.4 --> 2621.599
paranoid as

2618.64 --> 2624.319
in very

2621.599 --> 2627.1600000000003
alert always expecting [ __ ] to break

2624.319 --> 2630.0
loose but not to like a detriment of my

2627.16 --> 2632.24
comfort I'm like always comfortable but

2630.0 --> 2633.76
just like always expecting a SWAT team

2632.24 --> 2638.4799999999996
to jump

2633.76 --> 2638.48
in like even though they make makes no

2640.52 --> 2645.04
sense but it's not discomfort comforting

2643.839 --> 2648.52
to me

2645.04 --> 2651.2799999999997
now like 10 years ago I that's very

2648.52 --> 2653.559
uncomfortable now it's like yeah okay

2651.28 --> 2657.48
this is just this is just what it is now

2653.559 --> 2659.0400000000004
this is this is reality now this is what

2657.48 --> 2661.44
I

2659.04 --> 2664.7599999999998
am whatever I'm going to become is got

2661.44 --> 2668.0

Sunday

2852.37 --> 2856.839
[Music]

2854.8 --> 2860.0
oh yeah and also I had a call with my

2856.839 --> 2864.0789999999997
friend from na again

2860.0 --> 2867.0
yesterday remember that friend that was

2864.079 --> 2869.2400000000002
dying that she mentioned that yeah that

2867.0 --> 2872.24
I talked about she was all upset about

2869.24 --> 2874.72
it literally

2872.24 --> 2880.04
like what was

2874.72 --> 2884.68
it 15 minutes after she had arrived he

2880.04 --> 2884.68
died he was like literally waiting on

2889.52 --> 2895.96
her all right so it was she was like in

2892.359 --> 2897.24
grief a bit and just had to help her

2895.96 --> 2900.2400000000002
through

2897.24 --> 2904.1189999999997
that but I know how to I

2900.24 --> 2904.1189999999997
mean is not the first

2904.319 --> 2907.64
friend of her

2910.04 --> 2914.96
right but she was like really like she

2911.839 --> 2918.5589999999997
was like almost her father in a away

2914.96 --> 2920.839
when she went to really rough times like

2918.559 --> 2922.7200000000003
this is the guy that was actually really

2920.839 --> 2926.119
like helping her even when she was

2922.72 --> 2926.1189999999997
completely hysterical and

2926.44 --> 2931.2000000000003
[ __ ] so it's like very personal to her

2929.16 --> 2934.2
and very

2931.2 --> 2936.9199999999996
very

2934.2 --> 2939.48
missed he's very

2936.92 --> 2941.28
missed it was basically in a way like

2939.48 --> 2945.72
her real best

2941.28 --> 2945.7200000000003
friend on a more physical

2947.64 --> 2951.4
level and like for

2953.119 --> 2958.04
decades like she's known him for like

2955.68 --> 2958.04
two

2958.88 --> 2963.92
decades

2960.48 --> 2967.52
anyway yeah tragic things they do happen

2963.92 --> 2967.52
don't take the shot

2968.88 --> 2975.559
you know I mean even she tried to warn

2972.079 --> 2978.48
him about it I warned her about it and

2975.559 --> 2981.0600000000004
she warned him about it and he still did

2978.48 --> 2987.599
it and now he's

2981.06 --> 2990.64
[Music]

2987.599 --> 2993.799
dead and yes I'm absolutely directly

2990.64 --> 2993.799
blaming the facts for

2993.88 --> 3000.2400000000002
that although he had had problems

2996.52 --> 3001.7599999999998
blatantly physical problems like not

3000.24 --> 3004.52
very good

3001.76 --> 3007.079
condition because of drugs in the past

3004.52 --> 3009.68
and all these

3007.079 --> 3012.2400000000002
things but I mean he would have easily

3009.68 --> 3014.359
just kept going and going right that's

3012.24 --> 3016.799
what the faxes

3014.359 --> 3019.7599999999998
do people that could have easily just

3016.799 --> 3022.7599999999998
kept going and going and going and yeah

3019.76 --> 3028.0400000000004
it it just makes it that little bit

3022.76 --> 3028.0400000000004
extra hard and almost impossible and

3028.559 --> 3037.119
yeah I mean I swear it guys there's like

3034.24 --> 3037.1189999999997
people out

3037.599 --> 3044.88
there in government and corporations

3041.119 --> 3048.28
that have like just decided like oh

3044.88 --> 3050.599
you're trash or you're a junkie so I'm

3048.28 --> 3053.96
going to make sure you get that fact and

3050.599 --> 3057.1600000000003
die yeah I guarantee you that's what

3053.96 --> 3060.76
happened that's happen happened people

3057.16 --> 3064.5589999999997
condemned others to

3060.76 --> 3066.4
death made them go on a track where they

3064.559 --> 3069.96
would have to take

3066.4 --> 3073.119
it and die

3069.96 --> 3075.0
guys just regular people in government

3073.119 --> 3078.079
not nobody in power nobody with an

3075.0 --> 3080.2
authority just regular people when this

3078.079 --> 3084.4
came out like

3080.2 --> 3088.2
20120 regular people just took it upon

3084.4 --> 3092.319
themselves to to condemn people to

3088.2 --> 3097.319
death like you're trash I want you to

3092.319 --> 3100.319
get the V cuz I know they're going to

3097.319 --> 3100.319
die

3103.4 --> 3110.0
yeah you better check your damn doctor

3106.359 --> 3111.0789999999997
dude who is your doctor who is that is

3110.0 --> 3114.0
he

3111.079 --> 3116.599
really a human person or is he like kind

3114.0 --> 3117.88
of into eugenic like oh concerned with

3116.599 --> 3121.28
over

3117.88 --> 3125.119
population would you take a vaccine

3121.28 --> 3127.799
recommended by a person that like has

3125.119 --> 3130.799
opinions about

3127.799 --> 3130.799
overpopulation

3132.2 --> 3142.319
huh I have a lot of friends died no

3137.079 --> 3145.7200000000003
zero they all abandoned me before

3142.319 --> 3148.0
2020 I don't know I think they're good

3145.72 --> 3149.5989999999997
basically the friends that I used to

3148.0 --> 3152.28
have I think they're probably still

3149.599 --> 3154.7200000000003
alive because when I still knew them I

3152.28 --> 3158.4
was already hammering and hammering and

3154.72 --> 3161.48
hammering That vaccine dangerous you

3158.4 --> 3164.48
never need them it doesn't

3161.48 --> 3164.48
work

3165.559 --> 3171.079
yeah I was warning people about the flu

3168.68 --> 3173.7599999999998
shot in in

3171.079 --> 3176.44
2010 all my friends all of

3173.76 --> 3179.44
them like really really warning about it

3176.44 --> 3181.4
like getting Alex Jones related sources

3179.44 --> 3184.48
and like shoving it in their face and

3181.4 --> 3187.44
like they would take that serious they

3184.48 --> 3191.559
knew like oh okay wow flu vaccines

3187.44 --> 3195.2000000000003
really is a scam like they got that even

3191.559 --> 3198.6400000000003
though oh they're kind of weird and

3195.2 --> 3200.72
liberal those friends of mine from then

3198.64 --> 3202.8799999999997
they still got this they're not going to

3200.72 --> 3204.9599999999996
fall for that now because I warned them

3202.88 --> 3207.7200000000003
about it even though they're not my

3204.96 --> 3209.52
friend anymore really because I got into

3207.72 --> 3212.4399999999996
Flat Earth and it was absolutely

3209.52 --> 3212.44
unacceptable for

3214.68 --> 3221.0
them or rather it made it really easy

3218.16 --> 3225.04
for them to completely abandon me all of

3221.0 --> 3225.04
a sudden which is what

3226.96 --> 3232.119
happened

3228.64 --> 3235.7599999999998
right first you you talk to people like

3232.119 --> 3239.599
every week at least one time every week

3235.76 --> 3242.599
for 20 years and then

3239.599 --> 3242.599
suddenly

3242.799 --> 3246.04
nope not

3248.44 --> 3252.599
anymore now their voices has changed

3251.119 --> 3255.96
every time they pick up the phone and

3252.599 --> 3259.839
it's like you sound they sound like they

3255.96 --> 3262.079
think you're you've done them wrong like

3259.839 --> 3266.0
you hurt them by bringing up Flat Earth

3262.079 --> 3269.28
one time like they're waiting for me to

3266.0 --> 3272.88
apologize for bringing up Flat Earth

3269.28 --> 3275.559
they never said that but I could feel it

3272.88 --> 3277.0
after that moment they were waiting for

3275.559 --> 3280.8390000000004
me to

3277.0 --> 3280.839
apologize for bringing it

3284.88 --> 3291.76
up right but I don't think these guys

3287.799 --> 3294.839
have taken the shot and perished under

3291.76 --> 3297.88
it they might have though but I mean I

3294.839 --> 3300.48
still still saw those around walking out

3297.88 --> 3302.88
there they're like live not too far away

3300.48 --> 3304.4
from me so there is like they probably

3302.88 --> 3306.28
like know somebody that's in this

3304.4 --> 3308.0
neighborhood and sometimes go to them to

3306.28 --> 3312.4
like game or

3308.0 --> 3314.319
something so I've seen them around so

3312.4 --> 3317.799
they're still around the last time I saw

3314.319 --> 3321.2799999999997
them was like in the last half

3317.799 --> 3324.0
year so no I don't actually know any

3321.28 --> 3326.6400000000003
direct friends that have

3324.0 --> 3331.44
died from

3326.64 --> 3333.72
vax but pretty much all my friends know

3331.44 --> 3335.92
other people that have

3333.72 --> 3339.2
died from

3335.92 --> 3340.839
it I personally don't know any people

3339.2 --> 3343.48
that have died from it maybe because

3340.839 --> 3345.2799999999997
it's just like yeah I'm not going to be

3343.48 --> 3347.319
your friend because I know you're going

3345.28 --> 3349.799
to die in seven years because you're too

3347.319 --> 3352.0389999999998
[ __ ] stupid to look for the mass

3349.799 --> 3354.52
propaganda that's going to roll out even

3352.039 --> 3356.079
though I'm not even conscious about that

3354.52 --> 3359.2
happening

3356.079 --> 3363.039
yet and oh does that sound convoluted

3359.2 --> 3366.0
and yeah well hey my subconscious you

3363.039 --> 3368.88
know I've seen visions and not

3366.0 --> 3371.52
consciously understood them at the

3368.88 --> 3373.119
time like being pre-programmed about

3371.52 --> 3376.2
things that are going to happen and then

3373.119 --> 3377.44
not realizing what it is I'm witnessing

3376.2 --> 3380.0
but that doesn't mean that my

3377.44 --> 3382.52
subconscious doesn't understand

3380.0 --> 3383.68
that it's like you witness something

3382.52 --> 3386.48
super

3383.68 --> 3388.24
dramatic you don't even realize that it

3386.48 --> 3390.28
is about the future and that it's really

3388.24 --> 3393.16
going to happen

3390.28 --> 3395.92
but the thing that you witnessed is

3393.16 --> 3398.3999999999996
still influencing you that's kind of

3395.92 --> 3398.4
what it was

3398.76 --> 3403.2400000000002
like my

3400.76 --> 3406.4
vision seeing all these things happening

3403.24 --> 3410.16
but you can't you can't actually connect

3406.4 --> 3410.1600000000003
it to the Limar

3413.0 --> 3419.839
timeline but I like I knew I just knew

3416.68 --> 3422.839
like oh there's like I I thought it was

3419.839 --> 3422.839
actually the end of the

3425.44 --> 3431.48
world like really the end of the world

3428.079 --> 3434.2400000000002
not just like that like every like most

3431.48 --> 3438.599
people would die I thought it was going

3434.24 --> 3441.0789999999997
to go like that but it's just what's

3438.599 --> 3443.6800000000003
happened instead is that just a massive

3441.079 --> 3447.2000000000003
amount of people have been damaged

3443.68 --> 3449.7599999999998
medically and through programming and

3447.2 --> 3451.4399999999996
literally killed through medical things

3449.76 --> 3455.4
but it's not just

3451.44 --> 3459.319
like oh they're all dead from that but

3455.4 --> 3463.44
it's there's enough dead and enough

3459.319 --> 3465.2799999999997
damaged that like this entire world that

3463.44 --> 3469.0
we've all built like it can't be

3465.28 --> 3471.1600000000003
restored back to where we just came from

3469.0 --> 3474.64
it's like it's damage it's not going to

3471.16 --> 3478.1189999999997
regenerate back because of the overall

3474.64 --> 3478.1189999999997
condition that we find ourselves

3478.24 --> 3485.4799999999996
in so it's like it's really a goodbye to

3482.319 --> 3488.359
what we all thought we had really for

3485.48 --> 3494.76
real and the only way we can

3488.359 --> 3497.96
ever ever get past it is if we take down

3494.76 --> 3501.559
these controlling oligarch bastards that

3497.96 --> 3504.88
are programming all this for us without

3501.559 --> 3507.3590000000004
any mercy and that like not be stopped

3504.88 --> 3509.359
like not be stopped even if they say if

3507.359 --> 3511.68
you come for us we'll blow it up yeah

3509.359 --> 3514.319
they [ __ ] blow it up blow everything

3511.68 --> 3517.0789999999997
up we're coming from you we don't care

3514.319 --> 3520.92
if the entire world is one glass parking

3517.079 --> 3524.92
loot supposedly you are going to go

3520.92 --> 3527.64
nothing will stop you from going there's

3524.92 --> 3532.7200000000003
nothing you can do that can prevent you

3527.64 --> 3537.4
from you going going away forever all of

3532.72 --> 3540.64
you all your influence all the

3537.4 --> 3543.96
influence the influence arguably all of

3540.64 --> 3549.359
these [ __ ] scumbag oligark satanists

3543.96 --> 3549.359
have been doing for like 500 years

3552.44 --> 3556.4
roughly people think it's

3556.68 --> 3562.16
like like

3559.559 --> 3566.039
6066

3562.16 --> 3568.72
1666 roughly when this [ __ ] really

3566.039 --> 3570.92
started which is like oh the Renaissance

3568.72 --> 3573.0
yeah in the Renaissance the

3570.92 --> 3576.88
devil

3573.0 --> 3580.24
seduced certain people those people

3576.88 --> 3583.4
became Ultra powerful oligarchs those

3580.24 --> 3584.5989999999997
people became obsessed with becoming

3583.4 --> 3587.559
Ultra

3584.599 --> 3590.2000000000003
rulers at the cost of everything it

3587.559 --> 3593.88
roughly started then it's what we're

3590.2 --> 3596.2
still in and all this [ __ ] is never

3593.88 --> 3600.079
nothing is going going to

3596.2 --> 3602.0
restore maybe the family right

3600.079 --> 3605.44
temporarily but nothing's going to

3602.0 --> 3607.799
restore before these specific group of

3605.44 --> 3613.039
people that all Trace back to those

3607.799 --> 3613.0389999999998
moments when they are all done

3613.52 --> 3616.0389999999998
with and

3614.89 --> 3620.0
[Music]

3616.039 --> 3625.28
nothing can be allowed to stop

3620.0 --> 3628.2
us in reaching that moment in time where

3625.28 --> 3630.079
everything that started in

3628.2 --> 3634.5589999999997
1666 is

3630.079 --> 3634.559
fulfilled and done

3636.2 --> 3642.68
over you will not get anything back

3640.68 --> 3645.839
until those

3642.68 --> 3648.3999999999996
people and the things they set out to do

3645.839 --> 3651.52
and gain through the devil

3648.4 --> 3654.039
arguably that those contracts are

3651.52 --> 3657.88
fulfilled that basically they get what

3654.039 --> 3657.88
they want and then they lose it

3661.599 --> 3666.52
all it's almost like maybe we should

3664.28 --> 3668.28
just like give him everything just like

3666.52 --> 3670.72
put him

3668.28 --> 3673.079
there this hear me out for a moment I'm

3670.72 --> 3675.359
not saying like give the new world order

3673.079 --> 3677.0
but it's almost like well they want

3675.359 --> 3678.48
these thing they're [ __ ] arrogant

3677.0 --> 3680.68
they think that they're like oh you're

3678.48 --> 3682.88
all just a bunch of cattle we can just

3680.68 --> 3684.839
Slaughter you after right as being

3682.88 --> 3687.2400000000002
better than you well what if from that

3684.839 --> 3689.92
position if you just literally gave it

3687.24 --> 3693.0389999999998
all of it just to them like

3689.92 --> 3694.7200000000003
yes yes you can have this power to the

3693.039 --> 3696.44
level where you like push a button and

3694.72 --> 3699.5989999999997
somebody

3696.44 --> 3701.96
explodes with any without any recourse

3699.599 --> 3704.52
and just like give it all to them and

3701.96 --> 3708.2
like let's see how

3704.52 --> 3710.48
long they will survive

3708.2 --> 3713.4399999999996
that I give

3710.48 --> 3717.72
you maybe a

3713.44 --> 3717.7200000000003
month before they're all

3718.359 --> 3722.48
dead because that's how the devil

3723.64 --> 3729.8799999999997
works when you actually give them what

3726.76 --> 3734.44
they want they

3729.88 --> 3734.44
die it's part of the

3735.44 --> 3740.16
deal don't you

3737.559 --> 3743.119
see don't you see how that

3740.16 --> 3743.1189999999997
metaphysically

3743.359 --> 3746.359
works

3746.88 --> 3752.559
yeah the devil when you make a deal with

3748.68 --> 3755.5589999999997
the devil it's always your death you

3752.559 --> 3758.6800000000003
don't attain anything and then get to

3755.559 --> 3762.76
keep it forever there's no deal with the

3758.68 --> 3762.7599999999998
devil that gives you that

3763.48 --> 3771.64
option so maybe maybe if we'll hyper

3768.24 --> 3773.5989999999997
consciously just like okay they're not

3771.64 --> 3776.92
going to stop so maybe we should just

3773.599 --> 3780.92
give them AB absolutely

3776.92 --> 3784.0
everything and then let the devil

3780.92 --> 3784.0
collect his

3784.96 --> 3793.16
due on them not on us on

3790.039 --> 3795.6400000000003
them let's see what the devil

3793.16 --> 3801.72
does once they've

3795.64 --> 3801.72
all fulfilled their contract pretty much

3803.279 --> 3806.279
right

3808.68 --> 3812.839
right it's it's it's probably a crazy

3813.76 --> 3819.44
idea

3815.92 --> 3822.16
but you know if you expect that you can

3819.44 --> 3825.16
just ignore this these people what

3822.16 --> 3827.48
they're doing and you think that oh they

3825.16 --> 3829.96
will just get Justice right oh we

3827.48 --> 3831.92
stopped them we figured out the plan oh

3829.96 --> 3836.279
now let's get arrest get them arrested

3831.92 --> 3836.279
oh oh that that means it's finished

3836.96 --> 3842.359
right no

3839.76 --> 3844.599
no now that's just like sink to the

3842.359 --> 3846.24
background and then they'll get

3844.599 --> 3847.92
preferential treatment and then

3846.24 --> 3850.64
somebody's going to like buy him out of

3847.92 --> 3853.16
prison it's like oh no we'll just hire

3850.64 --> 3855.24
him oh we'll keep make sure he doesn't

3853.16 --> 3858.24
go get up to something

3855.24 --> 3859.4799999999996
naughty and then it's like oh yeah we

3858.24 --> 3862.4799999999996
just back in the

3859.48 --> 3862.48
saddle

3863.2 --> 3866.96
yeah

3864.76 --> 3871.48
it's not going to

3866.96 --> 3875.16
work you can't get these

3871.48 --> 3878.44
globalists taken down and kept in unless

3875.16 --> 3880.799
you get them

3878.44 --> 3884.279
all and I mean

3880.799 --> 3886.319
all everywhere all around the

3884.279 --> 3889.44
world all

3886.319 --> 3893.16
countries all their agencies all their

3889.44 --> 3895.079
connections all of it the whole damn

3893.16 --> 3897.2
thing

3895.079 --> 3901.799
only

3897.2 --> 3901.799
then is it going to be

3902.0 --> 3908.319
over right so either we take them all

3905.319 --> 3911.799
out or we give them what they want and

3908.319 --> 3911.799
watch the devil take his

3917.44 --> 3923.079
toll

3920.24 --> 3924.9599999999996
[Music]

3923.079 --> 3928.239

3924.96 --> 3928.239
[Music]

h

3961.38 --> 3967.829
[Music]

3973.599 --> 3979.2400000000002
all right so I got some kind of title

3975.96 --> 3981.2400000000002
now don't know if that's yeah based on

3979.24 --> 3983.0
the thought what I just laid

3981.24 --> 3986.0
[Music]

3983.0 --> 3986.0
out

3993.16 --> 4000.839
you gave me a suitable title excuse me I

3996.76 --> 4003.599
gave me that title thanks D I mean you

4000.839 --> 4003.599
probably gave me

4004.119 --> 4009.2400000000002
suggestions move me in a direction in

4007.039 --> 4009.2400000000002
the

4011.32 --> 4016.0
[Music]

4013.0 --> 4016.0
conversation

4031.079 --> 4036.6800000000003
most people are idiotic thanks to the

4033.88 --> 4036.6800000000003
Renaissance

4037.279 --> 4043.279
yeah what is the Renaissance you know in

4041.16 --> 4044.839
a way the Renaissance is the moment

4043.279 --> 4049.2
where people

4044.839 --> 4053.0389999999998
thought they were over it as in over the

4049.2 --> 4055.5589999999997
old world where like we would be under

4053.039 --> 4057.44
God and do what he says it's like no

4055.559 --> 4060.559
we're liberal

4057.44 --> 4064.119
now we can do what we want we

4060.559 --> 4067.88
can live as we want and by living the

4064.119 --> 4069.799
life we want we honor

4067.88 --> 4071.96
God

4069.799 --> 4076.359
Liberty n yeah

4071.96 --> 4076.359
but you know think think about it

4076.559 --> 4083.119
carefully now you can put it in the

4079.039 --> 4087.88
light of hey we just don't want to be

4083.119 --> 4091.6400000000003
ruled by the old Theocratic Priestly

4087.88 --> 4094.92
order right which is very reasonable

4091.64 --> 4094.92
they're messed up

4095.48 --> 4099.12
scum they're

4101.08 --> 4108.759
Hypocrites and their power hungry and

4105.199 --> 4112.3189999999995
greedy right old priests old priesthood

4108.759 --> 4114.839
from medieval times yeah nobody liked

4112.319 --> 4116.120000000001
them nobody thought they were spiritual

4114.839 --> 4118.44
they were just

4116.12 --> 4120.759
politics and they conquered people and

4118.44 --> 4123.4
they tortured people whenever

4120.759 --> 4126.04
convenient so yeah nobody thought that

4123.4 --> 4128.839
like the Christian churches at those

4126.04 --> 4130.839
time were actually spiritual in

4128.839 --> 4133.64
anyway just

4130.839 --> 4135.3189999999995
theocracy so yeah in that perspective

4133.64 --> 4137.4800000000005
it's it's like you could see the

4135.319 --> 4140.6
Renaissance As hey we want to get the

4137.48 --> 4142.759
[ __ ] rid of this dogmatic monster

4140.6 --> 4145.04
hypocritic dogmatic monster like we want

4142.759 --> 4147.12
to be free we want to do what we want to

4145.04 --> 4151.12
do want to get loaded and we want to

4147.12 --> 4155.599999999999
have a good time right that sounds

4151.12 --> 4158.3189999999995
great but if you abandon the old order

4155.6 --> 4160.799
then that also in this case means that

4158.319 --> 4165.4800000000005
you abandon the

4160.799 --> 4169.08
wisdom that was actually gathered

4165.48 --> 4171.759
of the old order that they eventually

4169.08 --> 4174.12
just kind of put in the corner and only

4171.759 --> 4176.359
manipulated and abused for more power

4174.12 --> 4178.96
and

4176.359 --> 4179.96
control but in a way the Renaissance was

4178.96 --> 4183.88
like

4179.96 --> 4186.4
a a Liberation from

4183.88 --> 4188.159000000001
God right and then you see all

4186.4 --> 4192.5599999999995
Liberation from the old church from the

4188.159 --> 4194.96
wrong ways right bad theoc theocracy

4192.56 --> 4198.360000000001
political power abuse

4194.96 --> 4198.36
yeah but it's also

4198.76 --> 4204.76
from taking God

4202.64 --> 4208.2390000000005
serious in

4204.76 --> 4211.400000000001
ways it is the notion that no if you

4208.239 --> 4213.44
just live a good life and like how you

4211.4 --> 4217.12
feel it's right

4213.44 --> 4219.879999999999
and and not by the strict guidelines

4217.12 --> 4221.679
right that's part of the whole

4219.88 --> 4224.92
Renaissance

4221.679 --> 4228.36
Revolution libertas like no you can

4224.92 --> 4228.36
completely decide your own

4232.0 --> 4238.719
destiny with less emphasis on God that's

4236.36 --> 4238.719
part of

4245.6 --> 4255.64
it right so yeah Renaissance we 76 7076

4251.28 --> 4255.639999999999
will commence again cool

4256.32 --> 4263.08
but it's

4258.56 --> 4266.64
cool in relation to the context of the

4263.08 --> 4270.199
British right the British the Red

4266.64 --> 4272.320000000001
Coats who were like can getting really

4270.199 --> 4273.96
bully-ish and

4272.32 --> 4276.0
like I

4273.96 --> 4279.36
mean the Red

4276.0 --> 4282.56
Coats they were not nice

4279.36 --> 4285.5599999999995
guys they were very

4282.56 --> 4285.56
brutal

4285.88 --> 4293.8
right like orderly but also like kind of

4289.28 --> 4297.239
brutal and merciless at times and Grim

4293.8 --> 4299.400000000001
like the British had had known like real

4297.239 --> 4301.919999999999
good times with like

4299.4 --> 4304.4
really Noble

4301.92 --> 4310.36
spiritedness among

4304.4 --> 4313.879999999999
them like tricky but still cool but like

4310.36 --> 4315.639
later on like the especially during the

4313.88 --> 4318.76
industrialization well eventually

4315.639 --> 4322.52
Britain of course as an empire fell but

4318.76 --> 4324.96
the whole time before that it was just

4322.52 --> 4324.96
really

4328.04 --> 4331.28
Grim it

4332.48 --> 4338.919999999999
wasn't it was more about

4335.36 --> 4338.92
power and it got

4339.92 --> 4345.1990000000005
Grim right and that's something that

4342.56 --> 4349.04
yeah the 77 6 re Revolution it really

4345.199 --> 4349.04
emphasized like no it was against the

4349.159 --> 4357.199
British right against that

4351.96 --> 4359.88
power but it was also also well yeah

4357.199 --> 4363.04
let's like also ignore everything that

4359.88 --> 4365.76
they've taught right because they have

4363.04 --> 4368.5199999999995
corrupted well we're going to make our

4365.76 --> 4370.719
own knowledge and see their own way

4368.52 --> 4375.719
completely abandoning more of the old

4370.719 --> 4375.719
knowledge and doing it their own own

4377.08 --> 4383.6
way but like dwelling

4381.04 --> 4387.4
further into the

4383.6 --> 4388.679
unknown arguably away from God away from

4387.4 --> 4392.32
the

4388.679 --> 4394.4800000000005
roots people the further away you go the

4392.32 --> 4397.92
more Roots AB you abandon the more

4394.48 --> 4400.959999999999
folklore becomes prominent and then like

4397.92 --> 4402.36
people just dwell with their ideas into

4400.96 --> 4405.36
random

4402.36 --> 4405.36
directions

4405.679 --> 4408.52
it becomes more

4426.04 --> 4432.36
chaotic renissance then LGBT Revolution

4430.6 --> 4436.04
is yeah

4432.36 --> 4439.92
terret that sounds funny but it kind of

4436.04 --> 4439.92
was man it kind of

4442.3 --> 4445.749
[Music]

4450.0 --> 4456.779
[Music]

4457.04 --> 4460.84
was right I'm going to finish this

4459.08 --> 4465.04
Illuminati kasan or it's like going to

4460.84 --> 4468.08
be Stone Cold by the end wait

4465.04 --> 4471.4
cheers hey Richard G hey you're back to

4468.08 --> 4471.4
uh Richard G

4488.03 --> 4491.2
[Music]

4492.28 --> 4495.28

m

4524.02 --> 4527.149
[Music]

4552.199 --> 4555.199
in

4570.08 --> 4575.14
[Music]

4580.239 --> 4585.12
H yeah that was great

4586.71 --> 4593.22
[Music]

4612.08 --> 4615.08
for

4629.4 --> 4635.0
educational

4630.96 --> 4638.36
system right well the educational system

4635.0 --> 4639.8
was like created by the robber barents

4638.36 --> 4643.88
to

4639.8 --> 4647.88
standardize teaching in order to

4643.88 --> 4652.679
help create more effective workers for

4647.88 --> 4652.679
the specific industry as it

4653.8 --> 4660.76
developed so you got to think of it like

4657.08 --> 4664.12
that it was like a corporate

4660.76 --> 4664.12
investment in

4664.44 --> 4671.36
government right cuz

4667.639 --> 4672.84
people well they want to figure out what

4671.36 --> 4675.5599999999995
they're going to be doing with their

4672.84 --> 4678.12
life how they're going to get by a lot

4675.56 --> 4681.96
of it would be

4678.12 --> 4683.639
farming right but hey Industries oh we

4681.96 --> 4686.32
got money we want to make more money

4683.639 --> 4689.28
it's growing it's getting better uh we

4686.32 --> 4692.239
got to have more workers they don't want

4689.28 --> 4693.759999999999
to work for us well how do we get this

4692.239 --> 4696.599999999999
these workers

4693.76 --> 4698.12
well you literally convince the

4696.6 --> 4701.92
government

4698.12 --> 4703.48
to program people

4701.92 --> 4706.159
to

4703.48 --> 4707.5199999999995
get these jobs that it's the future and

4706.159 --> 4710.599999999999
it's the best for

4707.52 --> 4713.360000000001
them so we created an education system

4710.6 --> 4715.4800000000005
which is basically going to be Shilling

4713.36 --> 4717.88
for yeah big

4715.48 --> 4719.0
corporations not much as changed has it

4717.88 --> 4721.96
really

4719.0 --> 4725.199
right and that's what they

4721.96 --> 4725.199
[Music]

4727.6 --> 4734.120000000001
did

4730.44 --> 4736.719
right corporations one wanted more

4734.12 --> 4739.48
workers for their shitty jobs so that

4736.719 --> 4741.56
they can make giant amounts of money and

4739.48 --> 4745.0
people didn't want to do the shitty

4741.56 --> 4748.080000000001
jobs so they use their giant amount of

4745.0 --> 4749.719
money to bribe the government and make

4748.08 --> 4752.639
sure that the government was going to

4749.719 --> 4755.8
create a system that would force people

4752.639 --> 4755.8
to go through

4756.08 --> 4763.84
programming that would make them more

4759.32 --> 4768.0
likely to at the end of that education

4763.84 --> 4771.32
choose the type of job that the oligarch

4768.0 --> 4771.32
paid the government

4772.199 --> 4776.12
for and that's called

4778.32 --> 4786.639
education that's what it always was

4782.4 --> 4789.679
guys right before that there was no such

4786.639 --> 4794.04
thing as this if there was an actual

4789.679 --> 4795.08
education it would be a two-or

4794.04 --> 4797.36
and a

4795.08 --> 4801.96
student and it could be

4797.36 --> 4806.48
in in the liberal arts it could be

4801.96 --> 4808.52
industry A Smith right the master smith

4806.48 --> 4810.839999999999
has the student student always has to

4808.52 --> 4813.080000000001
follow him around do everything he says

4810.84 --> 4816.0
that's how he learns that's how they

4813.08 --> 4818.28
used to do it at real education that's

4816.0 --> 4820.159
how somebody could be become a

4818.28 --> 4824.08
specialist over their

4820.159 --> 4827.719
life right that was how been for

4824.08 --> 4831.36
thousands and thousands of

4827.719 --> 4834.2390000000005
years yeah this Mass Programming type of

4831.36 --> 4837.599999999999
education is really very

4834.239 --> 4840.0
new unless you also want to count like

4837.6 --> 4842.120000000001
cult priest like

4840.0 --> 4844.04
indoctrination which is very close to

4842.12 --> 4847.48
education that may have happened all

4844.04 --> 4850.04
over the place not on a big scale like

4847.48 --> 4852.44
that but I mean it has been done in the

4850.04 --> 4854.92
past like how do you create a religious

4852.44 --> 4857.36
cult well through an education system

4854.92 --> 4860.32
specifically for

4857.36 --> 4864.48
that that those people would have to

4860.32 --> 4867.159
devise themselves for their

4864.48 --> 4868.959999999999
acolytes right so in that sense it's not

4867.159 --> 4872.5199999999995
new but to make it

4868.96 --> 4876.159
standard that's really new Mass class

4872.52 --> 4876.159000000001
education that's very

4878.88 --> 4884.4400000000005
young couple hundred

4881.639 --> 4886.6
years

4884.44 --> 4886.599999999999
hey

4891.239 --> 4895.239
dupons hope you all enjoying the

4896.12 --> 4899.229
[Music]

4900.04 --> 4903.84
show wish I had more

4903.87 --> 4906.92
[Music]

4911.639 --> 4914.639
coffee

4916.719 --> 4919.639
what are you guys talking

4925.36 --> 4930.759999999999
about yeah had to get them off the farms

4928.96 --> 4933.28
in in the city right and how do you do

4930.76 --> 4938.52
that well by mandating school like your

4933.28 --> 4940.88
kid has to go through this government

4938.52 --> 4943.0
mandated and then they can be

4940.88 --> 4947.08
manipulated in their minds and what they

4943.0 --> 4947.08
want they can be given other

4947.239 --> 4952.638999999999
dreams dreams to abandon the family

4949.96 --> 4952.639
business pretty

4953.199 --> 4959.638999999999
much and that's what they

4956.32 --> 4964.04
did that's what education

4959.639 --> 4968.12
did and that's how from a vast majority

4964.04 --> 4972.6
rural population with Farms everywhere

4968.12 --> 4974.32
it became more City Craftsman and

4972.6 --> 4976.72
Factory

4974.32 --> 4979.879
workers

4976.72 --> 4979.879
[Music]

4981.96 --> 4990.6
eventually yeah duper punon don't is

4986.0 --> 4992.76
yeah why do you keep digging up these

4990.6 --> 4995.360000000001
trash

4992.76 --> 4997.56
duper there's a lot of trashy people

4995.36 --> 5001.5199999999995
around duper you don't need

4997.56 --> 5004.4800000000005
to like I don't need to know every

5001.52 --> 5004.4800000000005
single one of them

5005.84 --> 5011.12
but yeah we're very well familiar with

5007.88 --> 5011.12
Jake the [ __ ]

5016.159 --> 5021.879999999999
thanks easily debunked AE map fair

5026.44 --> 5033.239
enough right so maybe he's opposing the

5030.32 --> 5036.5199999999995
typical disc earthers with the re of the

5033.239 --> 5039.0
Sun and the Moon in over that Circle

5036.52 --> 5041.639
right if he's doing that then yeah I

5039.0 --> 5043.96
guess he's finally catching on then

5041.639 --> 5043.96
that's

5046.56 --> 5051.4400000000005
good but I mean I don't particularly

5049.96 --> 5056.6
like that

5051.44 --> 5059.04
guy he's been like like using really bad

5056.6 --> 5061.96
drugs on his stream and all that and

5059.04 --> 5064.56
he's like really [ __ ] up and demonic

5061.96 --> 5066.44
sometimes like really bad like totally

5064.56 --> 5069.360000000001
totally dark

5066.44 --> 5072.32
Unapologetic it's like messed up I don't

5069.36 --> 5074.599999999999
like Jake he said a couple of things

5072.32 --> 5076.679
probably that were cool or whatever but

5074.6 --> 5076.679
I

5079.639 --> 5085.08
mean

5081.92 --> 5087.56
yeah yeah Jake and jiren got into like a

5085.08 --> 5090.32
fight and went back and forth like a

5087.56 --> 5090.320000000001
year ago or

5090.88 --> 5096.8
more I just

5093.199 --> 5096.799999999999
I don't want to deal with him

5106.84 --> 5111.92
really yeah the homeless guy yeah that

5109.32 --> 5111.92
was just

5112.4 --> 5119.119
terrible I mean if he does that to some

5115.639 --> 5124.28
homeless guy he'd do that to me so like

5119.119 --> 5124.28
[ __ ] that guy [ __ ] Jake the [ __ ]

5137.63 --> 5140.6990000000005
[Music]

5151.28 --> 5154.28
for

5154.92 --> 5159.36
but who knows man maybe he's improving

5157.08 --> 5161.36
on his life maybe he's finally realized

5159.36 --> 5163.4
that he was like completely idiotic and

5161.36 --> 5165.759999999999
misbehaving and maybe he's getting a

5163.4 --> 5168.04
becoming a better man I don't know I

5165.76 --> 5171.96
haven't really kept track you know

5168.04 --> 5171.96
people can suddenly turn around

5172.239 --> 5177.678999999999
but I mean if it really stands out how

5175.639 --> 5179.84
he's turned around then i' probably like

5177.679 --> 5181.76
people would pick up on that and start

5179.84 --> 5182.76
saying something about it like on

5181.76 --> 5185.92
channnel

5182.76 --> 5188.360000000001
then people would know like oh Jake's

5185.92 --> 5190.52
really transformed or something but I

5188.36 --> 5193.159
don't think so I don't think that's

5190.52 --> 5193.159000000001
currently the

5195.15 --> 5201.679
[Music]

5197.76 --> 5203.280000000001
case how can he even do that jarn was

5201.679 --> 5206.8
right in calling him out one and a half

5203.28 --> 5210.759999999999
years ago yeah he was right about

5206.8 --> 5213.08
that but look where jiren is

5210.76 --> 5215.76
now uh

5213.08 --> 5217.88
right but just because jiren has gone

5215.76 --> 5219.4800000000005
that low doesn't mean that Jake is now

5217.88 --> 5222.4800000000005
the good

5219.48 --> 5222.48
guy

5232.63 --> 5235.829
[Music]

5240.8 --> 5245.8
so t an autistic kid what the

5247.28 --> 5253.36
[ __ ] I didn't even know that build

5249.52 --> 5253.360000000001
answer that's me that's just messed

5271.119 --> 5274.119
up

5276.76 --> 5284.4400000000005
oh man it's getting dark already damn

5280.239 --> 5287.599999999999
it it's cold and dark and why is it

5284.44 --> 5290.239
always so cold in the winter oh yeah

5287.6 --> 5294.2390000000005
because it's winter damn

5290.239 --> 5294.239
it yeah it's okay I'm

5297.96 --> 5304.92
just I mean it's great being like 1/8

5302.28 --> 5308.8
jungle Asian

5304.92 --> 5311.159
Indonesian but uh yeah when it gets cold

5308.8 --> 5313.4400000000005
and all that it's really unpleasant that

5311.159 --> 5316.0
1/8 of jungle

5313.44 --> 5319.4
Asian I can't imagine what it would be

5316.0 --> 5321.52
like if I was like full on like brown

5319.4 --> 5325.759999999999
Indonesian I

5321.52 --> 5325.76
mean for them it must really

5326.52 --> 5334.0
suck I'm just lucky to be like mostly

5331.04 --> 5334.0
white J

5334.119 --> 5339.5199999999995
ically I don't know although my mother

5336.679 --> 5342.04
was well pretty much completely white

5339.52 --> 5345.080000000001
and she would always get like really

5342.04 --> 5346.639
almost terrified of the cult so maybe in

5345.08 --> 5350.6
this case it's not really even the

5346.639 --> 5350.6
jungle Asian that's giving me so much

5357.08 --> 5364.679
trouble get up earlier

5360.92 --> 5367.2390000000005
no get oh it helps it really no it just

5364.679 --> 5367.2390000000005
makes me

5367.36 --> 5372.839999999999
sick getting up early is not good for

5378.92 --> 5384.6
me Northern blood but you loath winter

5390.04 --> 5395.32
right it's like how do you classify that

5395.36 --> 5401.48
right if you're like Northern blooded

5399.239 --> 5403.4
but you're really good at resisting the

5401.48 --> 5406.879999999999
cold that really makes you like kind of

5403.4 --> 5409.759999999999
Nordic so if you're

5406.88 --> 5415.119
really Northern blooded but you like

5409.76 --> 5415.119000000001
hate the C does that make you grabler

5416.0 --> 5419.719
blooded is that the

5420.84 --> 5423.84
thing

5432.52 --> 5439.280000000001
is it just the the grabler mingling in

5436.119 --> 5441.839999999999
that's like complaining about the

5439.28 --> 5443.8
cold hey do I hate the cold did my

5441.84 --> 5446.1990000000005
mother hate the cold because we had a

5443.8 --> 5449.52
pretty strong grabler

5446.199 --> 5450.839999999999
within within her in within her white in

5449.52 --> 5453.84
within her

5450.84 --> 5453.84
whiteness

5454.44 --> 5460.199
or to be more fair a Jew is it

5465.0 --> 5470.36
that this sounds weird but like guys

5468.32 --> 5473.28
that you would associate with Jewish how

5470.36 --> 5476.08
well do they handle colds I mean

5473.28 --> 5479.44
probably if they're like Russian Jews or

5476.08 --> 5480.76
something they handle it decently but

5479.44 --> 5482.719
compared to

5480.76 --> 5486.76
others

5482.719 --> 5489.88
how are Jews with cold like the the race

5486.76 --> 5495.119000000001
you the family lines and all that how do

5489.88 --> 5495.119
they handle the cold compared to other

5495.36 --> 5499.92
people that would typically surround

5497.56 --> 5501.92
them in those regions are they good with

5499.92 --> 5503.88
cold or are they really bad with cold

5501.92 --> 5507.08
how is that on average or is there no

5503.88 --> 5510.76
average it's in all directions does

5507.08 --> 5513.76
anybody have any answers for this in

5510.76 --> 5513.76
here

5526.76 --> 5537.52
oh okay you're just completely

5532.48 --> 5537.5199999999995
not onto anything I'm talking about all

5540.679 --> 5545.8
right there's something about genetics

5543.159 --> 5549.08
that seems off yeah Richard G I mean I'm

5545.8 --> 5553.6
not saying specifically genetic it might

5549.08 --> 5555.719
be like an inherited Spirit

5553.6 --> 5559.1990000000005
yeah

5555.719 --> 5559.199
right I'm just

5560.04 --> 5567.639
wondering do people of Jewish

5564.159 --> 5573.08
descent handle the cold

5567.639 --> 5575.400000000001
well or do they not handle the cold well

5573.08 --> 5578.159
I want to know I want to know the

5575.4 --> 5578.159
average of

5583.159 --> 5588.679
that like or is it like completely like

5586.92 --> 5590.52
oh well this family is like yeah they

5588.679 --> 5592.52
can just walk out in the snow without

5590.52 --> 5595.96
any shiver and the other one is like

5592.52 --> 5598.320000000001
Falls over all Frozen up oh

5595.96 --> 5601.92
nice because they're like so intolerant

5598.32 --> 5604.32
to the I don't know man I don't know how

5601.92 --> 5605.639
it is I want to know cuz I just want to

5604.32 --> 5609.28
figure out

5605.639 --> 5610.719
like is this like a secretly a Jew in me

5609.28 --> 5613.239
that's hiding

5610.719 --> 5617.76
there that makes me so intolerant to the

5613.239 --> 5617.759999999999
coal or is that really just completely

5626.44 --> 5633.5599999999995
arbitrary you like jumping into a

5628.76 --> 5633.56
freezing leg damn Gideon sick

5639.6 --> 5642.639
you want your hot water

5646.719 --> 5650.44
bottle I don't blame

5656.8 --> 5662.4400000000005
you heating

5658.76 --> 5664.76
bills right well hot water water bottle

5662.44 --> 5666.599999999999
significantly decreases those bills

5664.76 --> 5671.2390000000005
wouldn't you say I mean it's very

5666.6 --> 5671.2390000000005
efficient way of Distributing

5687.76 --> 5694.320000000001
heat they live in igu build

5703.88 --> 5706.88
dancer

5712.36 --> 5717.839999999999
is is there a Park you can go to where

5715.36 --> 5720.4
is no one's

5717.84 --> 5721.92
around

5720.4 --> 5724.96
uh

5721.92 --> 5727.159
in the middle of the city well it is

5724.96 --> 5729.36
winter so there's probably not a lot of

5727.159 --> 5732.0
people sitting in the park right now but

5729.36 --> 5735.599999999999
yeah there is a park it's called Juliana

5732.0 --> 5735.6
Park it's really

5736.44 --> 5741.48
close it's like 2 minutes away on the

5745.44 --> 5753.638999999999
bicycle like just west of me

5750.04 --> 5755.84
here and there's like there it's like

5753.639 --> 5757.96
crowded with chickens out there that

5755.84 --> 5762.0
just walk in the park

5757.96 --> 5764.76
freely like hundreds of them and they

5762.0 --> 5769.119
have like a mini Zoo too with other

5764.76 --> 5769.119000000001
animals they got goats and I've seen

5771.48 --> 5776.839999999999
pigs and a lot of different

5774.08 --> 5779.32
birds but yeah that park is there but I

5776.84 --> 5782.679
mean yeah it's cold I don't like it

5779.32 --> 5785.28
outside in the cold I just like it

5782.679 --> 5789.0
besides all my freaking clothes have

5785.28 --> 5790.96
holes in it I only go outside if I like

5789.0 --> 5794.0
really have

5790.96 --> 5796.639
to because like if I go outside I have

5794.0 --> 5799.28
to make it into a sport because if I

5796.639 --> 5802.639
don't I will literally get

5799.28 --> 5806.159
sick from getting too cold because I

5802.639 --> 5806.159000000001
have holes in

5806.679 --> 5812.4
everything it

5809.6 --> 5814.8
sucks I mean it's it's fine in the

5812.4 --> 5817.879999999999
summer but when it's winter and it's

5814.8 --> 5817.88
cold then it

5818.92 --> 5824.56
sucks don't they have Thrift I don't

5821.32 --> 5824.5599999999995
even know what that is B

5826.04 --> 5831.5199999999995
dancer but I don't think they have like

5829.119 --> 5833.04
shoes like I have holes in my shoes I

5831.52 --> 5835.280000000001
have holes in my pants I have holes in

5833.04 --> 5835.28
my

5835.6 --> 5844.119000000001
jacket it's yeah too

5840.199 --> 5846.159
bad yeah maybe if I got more support not

5844.119 --> 5848.759999999999
that I'm going to demand that but maybe

5846.159 --> 5850.879999999999
if I did then eventually like I wouldn't

5848.76 --> 5853.56
just have to worry about if I'm going to

5850.88 --> 5856.92
get enough food to eat in the next few

5853.56 --> 5861.76
days I might actually think like huh

5856.92 --> 5861.76
maybe I really could try to get some new

5863.119 --> 5869.48
pants in which case I will definitely

5866.28 --> 5873.36
not just get the first cheap shitty

5869.48 --> 5876.5599999999995
thing absolutely not right but yeah I'm

5873.36 --> 5876.5599999999995
not in that position

5876.599 --> 5880.679
so yeah too

5882.44 --> 5887.159
bad special Fabrics yeah I don't even

5885.28 --> 5889.36
know I I don't even know how to get

5887.159 --> 5893.92
those special Fabrics at this

5889.36 --> 5895.88
point I know what the material code was

5893.92 --> 5897.719
I don't know if that's even here if

5895.88 --> 5899.96
there's anything about it left in the

5897.719 --> 5902.599
Netherlands and if they had like an

5899.96 --> 5904.679
upgrade of that fabric

5902.599 --> 5906.639
right and I'd love to get some new pant

5904.679 --> 5909.56
but it's just dude it's not going to

5906.639 --> 5911.84
[ __ ] happen okay it's not going to

5909.56 --> 5916.04
happen unless all of you start throwing

5911.84 --> 5919.56
€50 bills at me on a regular basis yeah

5916.04 --> 5922.44
you all start throwing 50 bills at me

5919.56 --> 5924.56
then it's actually going to happen then

5922.44 --> 5926.759999999999
yeah then I'll actually like eventually

5924.56 --> 5929.04
get a new monitor and it'll actually get

5926.76 --> 5931.4800000000005
a new air filter and it'll actually get

5929.04 --> 5935.239
new pants and actually new shoes an

5931.48 --> 5941.839999999999
actually new jacket you not doing that

5935.239 --> 5945.919999999999
it's not going to happen then do you

5941.84 --> 5950.84
understand I mean I'm fine with

5945.92 --> 5953.679
it but stop expecting those things to

5950.84 --> 5958.119000000001
happen cuz they're not unless you all

5953.679 --> 5960.04
start throwing 50 Euro bills at me

5958.119 --> 5963.04
continually and you're

5960.04 --> 5963.04
not

5964.92 --> 5969.1990000000005
yeah I know Bill that well I didn't know

5966.639 --> 5971.599
I know now but

5969.199 --> 5974.839999999999
yeah you pay your

5971.599 --> 5977.56
way oh if you want to pay your gay away

5974.84 --> 5979.360000000001
you can always do that here like Owen

5977.56 --> 5981.84
benj is not the only place you can pay

5979.36 --> 5981.839999999999
your gay

5982.08 --> 5989.199
away but

5984.28 --> 5992.44
uh yeah I'm not expecting you all to be

5989.199 --> 5996.239
rich I'm hoping you you get you might be

5992.44 --> 5999.239
or like wealthy enough to dull some

5996.239 --> 5999.239
around or whatever

5999.4 --> 6003.5199999999995
but if it's not happening it's not

6001.639 --> 6006.679
happening and maybe if you would be rich

6003.52 --> 6008.719
enough you'd start hating me because now

6006.679 --> 6011.28
being around me is going to like keep

6008.719 --> 6013.199
reminding you of the dark sides of those

6011.28 --> 6015.639
types of decisions you made about how

6013.199 --> 6017.879999999999
you're going to do things in life right

6015.639 --> 6021.32
so then you don't want me to have the

6017.88 --> 6024.4800000000005
money cuz you didn't make the sacrifice

6021.32 --> 6028.119
like I did now you don't deserve the

6024.48 --> 6032.199
money you need to be poor cuz you didn't

6028.119 --> 6032.199
want to give up all those things that I

6034.199 --> 6040.96
did right one of these rich bastards

6038.4 --> 6043.719
just as a gesture just for the [ __ ]

6040.96 --> 6047.08
fun of it could just throw 500 at me

6043.719 --> 6049.719
just one time B just be like yeah let's

6047.08 --> 6054.199
fix this but

6049.719 --> 6058.08
no now they don't want to do

6054.199 --> 6062.48
that cuz they'll look at me and think no

6058.08 --> 6066.04
that guy doesn't deserve my

6062.48 --> 6071.199
money cuz he didn't go through all that

6066.04 --> 6071.199
[ __ ] that I did to get my

6073.0 --> 6079.84
money so he doesn't deserve

6076.159 --> 6082.839999999999
that just be poor Arin

6079.84 --> 6082.84
then

6085.44 --> 6091.638999999999
yeah right or or maybe it's even more

6088.28 --> 6093.84
maybe it's like yeah well I'd love to

6091.639 --> 6097.36
help you out but you keep talking about

6093.84 --> 6099.88
the things that I'll get into big big

6097.36 --> 6102.36
trouble over when it's all discovered

6099.88 --> 6106.08
because yeah how do you think I got my

6102.36 --> 6108.119
money huh yeah and Arwin always brings

6106.08 --> 6112.119
up these subjects that

6108.119 --> 6114.32
basically will get the police on my ass

6112.119 --> 6117.598999999999
in the end and we don't want that so

6114.32 --> 6120.759999999999
we're not going to give our our money

6117.599 --> 6124.52
because of the way we got our

6120.76 --> 6124.52
money yeah that could be it

6136.0 --> 6141.48
too have a wealthy uncle and here's how

6139.0 --> 6145.239
he's thinks yeah I have a healthy Uncle

6141.48 --> 6147.799999999999
too one of my brothers from my

6145.239 --> 6150.239
dad he's like a

6147.8 --> 6152.4400000000005
millionaire or at least he used to be I

6150.239 --> 6154.879999999999
think he might probably still but I mean

6152.44 --> 6159.759999999999
that guy is like a creepy connected

6154.88 --> 6159.76
guy he's basically the grabler of the

6160.76 --> 6165.52
family although he's a pretty cool guy

6164.0 --> 6167.88
for her

6165.52 --> 6169.76
grabler I don't know I'm I don't even

6167.88 --> 6172.04
know him that well but I

6169.76 --> 6174.84
mean

6172.04 --> 6178.239
I don't even think he knows what I do in

6174.84 --> 6178.2390000000005
life at this

6181.44 --> 6187.32
point but it's not like I ever begged

6184.0 --> 6190.239
him for money because I know better like

6187.32 --> 6193.199
technically there's nothing worse

6190.239 --> 6194.919999999999
karmically for you than begging really

6193.199 --> 6200.4
rich people for

6194.92 --> 6203.719
money they savagely hatte it they really

6200.4 --> 6206.839999999999
hated when you do that like if you had

6203.719 --> 6209.84
any good feelings between you if you ask

6206.84 --> 6212.360000000001
a rich person for money all that good

6209.84 --> 6215.400000000001
feeling's all gone it's all going to be

6212.36 --> 6218.28
replaced with something

6215.4 --> 6221.32
else and that's something else is very

6218.28 --> 6221.32
rarely anything

6221.76 --> 6227.92
good that's why I've made it into a

6225.159 --> 6232.159
thing to just like never ask a really

6227.92 --> 6234.52
rich person directly for money just ever

6232.159 --> 6237.0
like I'll rather just play on their

6234.52 --> 6238.92
feelings until they feel so shitty that

6237.0 --> 6240.92
they on their own Val start throwing

6238.92 --> 6244.08
money at me just to make me stop making

6240.92 --> 6246.4
them sad or something but I will never

6244.08 --> 6249.44
ask an actual rich person for money I

6246.4 --> 6249.44
will just not do

6254.0 --> 6258.28
that you don't have what you want work

6256.719 --> 6259.599
harder hey what do you think I'm doing

6258.28 --> 6262.5199999999995
right

6259.599 --> 6264.119000000001
here I do a show every day

6262.52 --> 6267.119000000001
Bill

6264.119 --> 6267.119
795

6267.199 --> 6274.0
shows how many people out there do you

6270.88 --> 6276.119
know that have

6274.0 --> 6281.48
1795

6276.119 --> 6283.28
shows that don't work hard enough for

6281.48 --> 6286.5199999999995
it

6283.28 --> 6289.5599999999995
yeah just try to find anybody that could

6286.52 --> 6293.1990000000005
do anything that many

6289.56 --> 6293.1990000000005
times and you'll have

6294.84 --> 6299.04
trouble that's not work work comes with

6298.08 --> 6301.0
the

6299.04 --> 6303.84
paycheck yeah well what if the work

6301.0 --> 6303.84
doesn't come with the

6305.199 --> 6310.0
paycheck maybe sometimes the work is

6307.76 --> 6313.0
just the work and you're lucky if you

6310.0 --> 6314.679
get payment cuz sometimes you got to

6313.0 --> 6317.4
keep the work

6314.679 --> 6319.639
going even when there's no payment

6317.4 --> 6322.48
otherwise the work goes away and then so

6319.639 --> 6322.4800000000005
will the payment

6323.56 --> 6329.84
yeah sometimes the jobs need to be done

6326.119 --> 6329.839999999999
because that job needs to keep

6336.48 --> 6342.0
existing yeah I mean it's not uncommon

6340.239 --> 6344.159
that like

6342.0 --> 6346.599
professionals at times just do their

6344.159 --> 6349.48
work for

6346.599 --> 6353.32
free because there's something else

6349.48 --> 6353.32
beside money that they could get out of

6357.8 --> 6362.679
it besides when you're like a really

6360.199 --> 6365.0
good Craftsman you you'll never have

6362.679 --> 6368.0
shortage of money or

6365.0 --> 6368.0
work

6370.679 --> 6375.599
rarely so then if you're not if you're

6373.56 --> 6378.04
not short on anything any of those

6375.599 --> 6381.08
things then yeah then you could also do

6378.04 --> 6384.199
work for free because you have that

6381.08 --> 6384.199
capacity of

6386.92 --> 6393.08
maneuvering so

6390.199 --> 6396.5199999999995
yeah a very small percentage of

6393.08 --> 6399.639
YouTubers can make consistent living

6396.52 --> 6403.599
it's not a huge gamble it's

6399.639 --> 6408.36
just are you going to be designated as

6403.599 --> 6411.04
the special Boy by YouTube are you coish

6408.36 --> 6414.28
enough to adapt perfectly

6411.04 --> 6416.92
to whatever the [ __ ] YouTube's ideology

6414.28 --> 6416.92
is at that

6417.88 --> 6423.8
moment but more importantly are you

6420.48 --> 6423.799999999999
designated a special

6424.239 --> 6433.879999999999
Boy by YouTube by the owners by the mega

6428.84 --> 6433.88
Corporation right that's way more

6435.679 --> 6440.92
important there's people on YouTube that

6439.4 --> 6444.839999999999
are making

6440.92 --> 6448.76
much less effort as what I do and they

6444.84 --> 6451.84
get thousands and thousands of

6448.76 --> 6455.52
subscribers hundreds of thousands and

6451.84 --> 6458.4800000000005
they get decent money out of it and

6455.52 --> 6461.679
they're [ __ ]

6458.48 --> 6464.678999999999
boring but they have thousands of people

6461.679 --> 6467.08
that just love them and all nothing but

6464.679 --> 6469.32
Praises yeah does that make any damn

6467.08 --> 6472.32
sense to

6469.32 --> 6472.32
you

6473.28 --> 6479.36
it's all [ __ ] it's all a scam I

6475.84 --> 6483.92
don't I don't believe any of that

6479.36 --> 6483.92
[ __ ] numbers on YouTube is

6484.48 --> 6491.44
[ __ ] yeah if my chat was just like

6487.96 --> 6495.28
like going pasturized with

6491.44 --> 6496.919999999999
just all these R people really people

6495.28 --> 6500.48
are those really

6496.92 --> 6502.599
people is that what people act like like

6500.48 --> 6505.04
a like a bunch of like a thousand

6502.599 --> 6508.679
chickens in a in a

6505.04 --> 6512.239
coup is that what people do in

6508.679 --> 6514.719
chats when they come in at Mass just act

6512.239 --> 6516.759999999999
like a bunch of weirdos like a random

6514.719 --> 6517.88
Animal Farm or something is that what

6516.76 --> 6521.719
people

6517.88 --> 6523.639
do cuz I don't like that I don't want to

6521.719 --> 6526.0
have like a thousand chickens running

6523.639 --> 6529.76
around in my

6526.0 --> 6533.32
chat so I guess I I wouldn't be able to

6529.76 --> 6536.52
be popular like that because it would

6533.32 --> 6536.5199999999995
get too noisy for

6544.719 --> 6549.28
me all right so yeah I'm not doing it

6547.4 --> 6552.28
for the statistics for the YouTube

6549.28 --> 6554.92
numbers or even for supposed ad

6552.28 --> 6557.8
money although I'm always open like hey

6554.92 --> 6560.96
YouTube if you want you could make me

6660.88 --> 6666.88
will outlive

6663.36 --> 6670.598999999999
YouTube yeah when YouTube's all the

6666.88 --> 6672.88
videos get all archived and taken off

6670.599 --> 6674.84
and you can't watch anything I will

6672.88 --> 6677.04
still be doing Flat Earth Early Bird

6674.84 --> 6680.159000000001
shows I'll just be doing one on on

6677.04 --> 6682.88
another platform so YouTube it's up to

6680.159 --> 6686.199
you either you take the freaking

6682.88 --> 6689.0
political top down clamps off everybody

6686.199 --> 6690.48
including myself and let YouTube

6689.0 --> 6694.4
actually be

6690.48 --> 6699.919999999999
natural be exactly as it

6694.4 --> 6705.04
is or we will all outlive

6699.92 --> 6707.76
you and discard you like a corrupted

6705.04 --> 6707.76
broken

6715.04 --> 6721.04
exactly like you have all the traits

6717.4 --> 6723.119
that we like about YouTube and all the

6721.04 --> 6726.56
Terrible Things That YouTube has been

6723.119 --> 6729.28
doing they all don't have them yeah so

6726.56 --> 6732.04
it's like these alternatives to YouTube

6729.28 --> 6735.119
will be like the perfect alternative it

6732.04 --> 6739.04
will be exactly what we wanted out of

6735.119 --> 6742.88
YouTube yeah that's how easy it will be

6739.04 --> 6745.719
eventually to completely transition away

6742.88 --> 6749.159000000001
from YouTube unless YouTube chooses to

6745.719 --> 6752.32
actually fix itself and get real

show or maybe you thought that was like

7166.84 --> 7173.04
oh Arwin did you really have to go there

7169.92 --> 7176.36
again why do you always do that

7173.04 --> 7179.239
Arwin don't you know that causes like

7176.36 --> 7181.679
80% of everybody that's watching that

7179.239 --> 7184.5599999999995
moment to like no I'm not going to go

7181.679 --> 7187.32
there this is just it's

7184.56 --> 7190.4800000000005
like like I'm too

7187.32 --> 7193.36
modern I'm not going to be part of that

7190.48 --> 7195.879999999999
anymore how dare you Arwin how dare you

7193.36 --> 7195.88
say

7205.88 --> 7214.56
that wish somebody hacked YouTube no

7210.28 --> 7217.5599999999995
duper it's way too big

7214.56 --> 7217.56
do

7218.159 --> 7221.92
yeah it's too

7226.719 --> 7231.8
big what's the name of that funny viewer

7229.92 --> 7235.8
voice I don't

7231.8 --> 7238.400000000001
know why does he have to have a

7235.8 --> 7242.8
name I don't even know what those voices

7238.4 --> 7242.799999999999
are they literally just manifest out of

7243.04 --> 7246.48
nowhere it just

7248.119 --> 7251.119
happens

7252.36 --> 7256.839999999999
I guess that it was like a specifically

7254.52 --> 7259.679
non-g grabler

7256.84 --> 7264.76
voice cuz when I go

7259.679 --> 7268.599
gra I do that kind of stuff but uh this

7264.76 --> 7270.679
is more like oh I am so modern I am I

7268.599 --> 7273.96
guess it's like a little like half

7270.679 --> 7277.719
Andrea toied or something like I'm the

7273.96 --> 7281.04
modern man I'm so good I'm so much

7277.719 --> 7281.04
better than everybody

7287.0 --> 7291.4
did you know someone recently

7289.04 --> 7295.28
infiltrated Bohemian Grove oh

7291.4 --> 7299.48
really what the hell okay what what

7295.28 --> 7301.8
happened duper are you sure that's real

7299.48 --> 7306.44
did you know Alex Jones did that

7301.8 --> 7306.4400000000005
like 25 years ago or

7307.599 --> 7314.079
something yeah Jones is Bill Hicks all

7310.76 --> 7318.320000000001
righty then Bill

7314.079 --> 7318.32
n that's that's one

7319.719 --> 7325.32
opinion I'm the male blank of Fe what

7323.92 --> 7328.04
the [ __ ] does that

7325.32 --> 7331.5199999999995
mean I'm that serious yeah I'm sure you

7328.04 --> 7334.0
are but it's horeshit though they're not

7331.52 --> 7334.0
the same

7336.11 --> 7343.239
[Music]

7337.96 --> 7343.2390000000005
person you know how you know that

7344.84 --> 7348.76
specifically hey who is that

7354.159 --> 7358.199
guy that's a really old

7358.719 --> 7362.0
actor I

7362.28 --> 7372.679
I voice actor radio 60 years ago okay so

7368.0 --> 7375.079
that's that's a you you're probably a

7372.679 --> 7377.8
boomer I've never heard of that guy

7375.079 --> 7380.96
before see

7377.8 --> 7384.28
me turns out this owl statue is Holo I'm

7380.96 --> 7386.599
sure it is hey tactical soap friend good

7384.28 --> 7386.599
to see

7386.719 --> 7392.599
you YouTuber dancer okay duper poons I'm

7390.199 --> 7395.199
not super

7392.599 --> 7399.159000000001
interested I would have been very

7395.199 --> 7401.96
interested like 20 years ago 30 years

7399.159 --> 7405.0
ago even no now

7401.96 --> 7408.32
no absolutely not it's like I know what

7405.0 --> 7410.88
they do it's not it's like yeah it was a

7408.32 --> 7414.199
huge secret like 30 years ago 40 years

7410.88 --> 7417.599
ago it's everybody knows it now it's

7414.199 --> 7420.839999999999
like the elite have come out of

7417.599 --> 7425.119000000001
hiding they have they're exposed like

7420.84 --> 7429.400000000001
it's over the ult nature of the

7425.119 --> 7431.839999999999
conspiracy is over it's done for it's

7429.4 --> 7434.799999999999
not coming back you can't get that

7431.84 --> 7437.88
bottle or that Genie back in the

7434.8 --> 7440.84
bottle he's not Bill hex yeah I know you

7437.88 --> 7445.0
know how I know clutch

7440.84 --> 7448.8
because Bill Hicks sweats in a different

7445.0 --> 7449.76
way as Alex you know what doesn't change

7448.8 --> 7454.4800000000005
as you

7449.76 --> 7454.4800000000005
age the location of your sweat

7454.559 --> 7459.4400000000005
glands and how they

7457.48 --> 7463.36
respond bill

7459.44 --> 7463.36
picks very different from

7463.719 --> 7468.84
Alex right just look at those moments

7466.88 --> 7472.639
where they get

7468.84 --> 7475.159000000001
sweaty they don't look the same because

7472.639 --> 7477.76
it's different just because they have

7475.159 --> 7481.36
very similar facial

7477.76 --> 7483.0
structure and even ways of saying things

7481.36 --> 7484.48
which is very logical because hey if you

7483.0 --> 7486.92
have the same facial structure it's

7484.48 --> 7489.4
going to work the same so you're very

7486.92 --> 7492.32
inclined to choose

7489.4 --> 7495.96
naturally during your Social Development

7492.32 --> 7499.36
the same types right you embrace the

7495.96 --> 7501.52
same type of of saying things and doing

7499.36 --> 7503.88
things you you follow a convenient

7501.52 --> 7505.679
stereotype so you'll be recognized with

7503.88 --> 7509.079
that type so it's only

7505.679 --> 7512.4
logical that Alex Jones Bill hex kind of

7509.079 --> 7516.558999999999
similar types would choose the same type

7512.4 --> 7519.558999999999
of ways even of saying things and right

7516.559 --> 7522.2390000000005
it's logical because they were very

7519.559 --> 7525.1990000000005
similar they're not the same person

7522.239 --> 7525.199
biologically

7525.52 --> 7529.279
[Music]

7530.719 --> 7536.4
though they have the same best friend

7533.239 --> 7539.558999999999
Kevin Booth I'm sure they

7536.4 --> 7542.079
did but I mean Kevin Booth is definitely

7539.559 --> 7544.320000000001
going to tell you no no yeah they they

7542.079 --> 7547.679
were both my best friends yeah and then

7544.32 --> 7550.4
Bill died and Alex still

7547.679 --> 7553.52
there they really were two different

7550.4 --> 7553.5199999999995
people Bill

7558.4 --> 7564.239
NY looks like him yeah I know he does

7561.239 --> 7564.239
WTH I

7567.0 --> 7574.679
know but what I also know is is

7570.88 --> 7577.079
that that nonsense conspiracy was

7574.679 --> 7580.599
pushed pretty

7577.079 --> 7580.599
vividly very early

7583.199 --> 7588.04
which makes it a control opposition

7585.92 --> 7591.559
conspiracy

7588.04 --> 7595.32
theory it was probably

7591.559 --> 7595.320000000001
planted the idea was

7595.44 --> 7602.04
planted and you could even say this is

7598.48 --> 7606.44
the real mind [ __ ] that Alex Jones

7602.04 --> 7609.719
planted that rumor himself as a bit to

7606.44 --> 7612.879999999999
control the opposition way at the

7609.719 --> 7615.32
beginning that he thought like I look

7612.88 --> 7619.079
kind of like Bill Hicks don't

7615.32 --> 7620.96
I and then when he dies it's like whoa

7619.079 --> 7625.079
what if we just made up The Conspiracy

7620.96 --> 7625.079
Theory like I am Bill

7625.639 --> 7631.88
Hicks people would buy that and they

7628.639 --> 7631.88
would talk about it all the

7632.679 --> 7637.52
time

7635.239 --> 7639.079
right and they

7637.52 --> 7642.320000000001
did

7639.079 --> 7644.239
Alex Jones on his live streams was like

7642.32 --> 7647.199
yeah people talking about me being Bill

7644.239 --> 7651.0
Hicks and here's why we're not the

7647.199 --> 7654.199
same and and yeah he addressed it many

7651.0 --> 7654.199
like why the [ __ ]

7655.0 --> 7660.44
was is not Bill hex Let It

7662.48 --> 7670.04
Go if you really want to check then

7665.559 --> 7672.8
check old Alex Jan footage

7670.04 --> 7675.719
from the time when they were both alive

7672.8 --> 7678.639
around that time look at moments where

7675.719 --> 7680.599
there's like embarrass embarrassment

7678.639 --> 7685.159000000001
self-consciousness like when sweat

7680.599 --> 7689.400000000001
breaks out and then just look at how

7685.159 --> 7693.799999999999
that looks with both of them is it the

7689.4 --> 7693.799999999999
same or is it never the

7696.599 --> 7701.679
same bet you never thought of looking at

7698.88 --> 7701.679
it like that did

7715.76 --> 7718.9490000000005

7745.119 --> 7750.32
home and he just shot the police

7747.44 --> 7753.759999999999
officers and then they like had to kill

7750.32 --> 7755.799999999999
them that's what happened to Bill Hicks

7753.76 --> 7760.320000000001
he got himself K he got himself killed

7755.8 --> 7760.320000000001

police and he shot one of

7764.44 --> 7770.079

7766.44 --> 7770.079
happened he's really

7771.76 --> 7780.84

are going to die on that

7879.8 --> 7883.76
Hill it's all a waste of

anything whether it's true or not so

duper I've been listening to him for

7903.239 --> 7910.718999999999
almost 20 years on a daily

7906.599 --> 7913.119000000001
basis I have voice changes that I go

7910.719 --> 7916.119
through like sometimes in a singular

7913.119 --> 7918.239
stream and Alex too has like yeah his

7916.119 --> 7921.679
voice can go over the

7918.239 --> 7921.678999999999
place can get

7922.88 --> 7927.4800000000005
raspy can yeah can get all kinds of

7925.36 --> 7930.0
things

7927.48 --> 7932.678999999999
so still entertaining though yeah sure

7930.0 --> 7932.679
blue that's

7932.84 --> 7939.0
sensible I just think it is a waste of

7935.239 --> 7944.638999999999
time it's like so what the [ __ ] if he

7939.0 --> 7947.52
was Bill Hicks who gives a [ __ ] what

7944.639 --> 7951.159000000001
does it change what does it matter

7947.52 --> 7951.159000000001
nothing absolutely

[ __ ] who gives a [ __ ] how does it matter

7992.159 --> 7995.5199999999995
where he came from only thing that

7994.04 --> 8000.28
matters is what he

7995.52 --> 8002.4800000000005
does and he does wrong [ __ ] all the time

8000.28 --> 8007.199
and then he does a little bit of good

8002.48 --> 8010.558999999999
too who cares whether the [ __ ] he's Bill

8007.199 --> 8014.44
Hicks or not who gives a

8010.559 --> 8017.159000000001
[ __ ] about any of that how about the

8014.44 --> 8021.199
[ __ ] notion that he might be CIA

8017.159 --> 8021.199
after all who

8022.92 --> 8029.96
cares it doesn't matter

8026.96 --> 8029.96
anything

8032.76 --> 8038.400000000001
what the [ __ ] is it going to change

8034.88 --> 8041.88
whether it's true or not nothing

8038.4 --> 8046.759999999999
absolutely nothing your view on him

8041.88 --> 8050.599
changes how does that matter absolutely

8046.76 --> 8052.079000000001
nothing it changes nothing absolutely

8050.599 --> 8054.28
nothing he's still going to be doing

8052.079 --> 8056.28
what he does he's still going to be

8054.28 --> 8059.4
popular with the people he's popular

8056.28 --> 8061.719
with and nobody gives a [ __ ] if you

8059.4 --> 8063.799999999999
think he's control opposition or

8061.719 --> 8066.719
whatever the [ __ ] you think about him it

8063.8 --> 8068.639
doesn't matter what you think about him

8066.719 --> 8070.639
and it doesn't matter whether you

8068.639 --> 8073.28
believe he's Bill Hicks or not it

8070.639 --> 8078.0
doesn't matter to anything it's

8073.28 --> 8078.0
completely irrelevant completely

8078.159 --> 8081.719
Superfluous it does

8086.88 --> 8089.88
nothing

8116.04 --> 8120.159
so there it is it doesn't matter doesn't

8118.559 --> 8124.4400000000005
matter what the [ __ ] he

8120.159 --> 8127.48
is if you trust anybody in media

8124.44 --> 8130.799999999999
blindly you're [ __ ] what you think

8127.48 --> 8133.119
Alex Jones oh you really need to

8130.8 --> 8134.599
specifically about that guy it's so

8133.119 --> 8138.0
important to know he's control

8134.599 --> 8139.92
opposition oh yeah how about every

8138.0 --> 8142.679
[ __ ] body

8139.92 --> 8146.04
else how about

8142.679 --> 8149.4
99.9% of people that you know from media

8146.04 --> 8152.44
how about that as has very likely

8149.4 --> 8156.5199999999995
controll opposition to a certain degree

8152.44 --> 8158.598999999999
yeah oh how the [ __ ] does that make any

8156.52 --> 8160.159000000001
difference it doesn't make any

8158.599 --> 8162.0
difference the only thing that's

8160.159 --> 8167.32
actually going to make a difference is

8162.0 --> 8168.8
whether you have the sensibility left to

8167.32 --> 8172.0
be able to

8168.8 --> 8176.079000000001
distinguish what is right and what is

8172.0 --> 8179.119
wrong from every single person you

8176.079 --> 8182.679
listen to yeah and when you know how to

8179.119 --> 8185.799999999999
do that it doesn't

8182.679 --> 8188.079
matter it doesn't

8185.8 --> 8190.719
matter whether they're control OPP

8188.079 --> 8195.279999999999
position or not because

8190.719 --> 8199.76
you know what is right and

8195.28 --> 8203.0
wrong yeah it only matters whether

8199.76 --> 8206.28
somebody's controlled opposition or not

8203.0 --> 8209.84
if you're going to

8206.28 --> 8211.08
blindly Trust trust them and do what

8209.84 --> 8215.24
they

8211.08 --> 8218.359
say and that is the problem if you're

8215.24 --> 8221.119999999999
doing that you trust

8218.359 --> 8226.0
man and not

8221.12 --> 8230.08
God yeah the sense the knowing the

8226.0 --> 8231.96
truth the Insight that will know what is

8230.08 --> 8235.319
right and what is wrong if you don't

8231.96 --> 8237.119999999999
trust that that God through you inside

8235.319 --> 8238.199999999999
of you knowing what is right and what is

8237.12 --> 8240.559000000001
wrong

8238.2 --> 8243.559000000001
and you just trust man well then you're

8240.559 --> 8245.199999999999
[ __ ] and that's biblical it doesn't

8243.559 --> 8247.679
matter whether somebody's control

8245.2 --> 8250.84
opposition or not all that matters is

8247.679 --> 8252.559
whether you know what is right and what

8250.84 --> 8255.960000000001
is

8252.559 --> 8258.679
wrong and then everything works

8255.96 --> 8262.039999999999
out no matter what they

8258.679 --> 8262.04
were or

8265.049 --> 8269.599
[Music]

8266.599 --> 8269.599
did

8272.459 --> 8277.599
[Music]

8274.76 --> 8280.12
Alex Jones was Peak Alex Jones when he

8277.599 --> 8282.399
said the [ __ ] now say it

8280.12 --> 8284.399000000001
right I don't like them putting

8282.399 --> 8286.88
chemicals in the water that turn the

8284.399 --> 8292.479
freaking fogs

8286.88 --> 8294.279999999999
gay do you understand that yeah that's

8292.479 --> 8298.639
yeah that's like Alex Jones when he just

8294.28 --> 8301.479000000001
had an adrenaline rush from it 20 0 or

8298.639 --> 8301.479
something great

8312.559 --> 8317.358999999999
times I would pay to see Alex Jones do

8315.2 --> 8319.960000000001
Bill Hicks joke he did that he did

8317.359 --> 8323.399000000001
actually do

8319.96 --> 8325.199999999999
that he played Bill get Hicks for a bit

8323.399 --> 8328.199999999999
one time he had like a whole show where

8325.2 --> 8329.559000000001
he did like two hours on the rumors of

8328.2 --> 8332.84
him being Bill

8329.559 --> 8335.599
Hicks that's like two years ago

8332.84 --> 8337.84
now yeah atrogene is making the freaking

8335.599 --> 8339.92
frogs gay that's correct Bill n signs

8337.84 --> 8343.92
and

8339.92 --> 8347.639
runoff atrazine runoff and just a little

8343.92 --> 8350.76
bit of that in the water frogs are super

8347.639 --> 8353.24
sensitive to chemicals like that and

8350.76 --> 8356.359
just a little bit of arrine runoff will

8353.24 --> 8359.24
literally scramble the Frog's internal

8356.359 --> 8361.719000000001
hormone system and they will become

8359.24 --> 8364.28
homosexual that is correct it's

8361.719 --> 8367.88
officially

8364.28 --> 8370.0
proven this scientifically proven that

8367.88 --> 8374.24
that actually is true that that

8370.0 --> 8377.519
happens and that it has happened with

8374.24 --> 8379.399
like in nature like in the water there

8377.519 --> 8383.08
so they tested it separately like how

8379.399 --> 8386.08
does arrine in water influence frogs and

8383.08 --> 8388.399
turn them gay and then yeah there's a

8386.08 --> 8390.6
real world location like yeah this is

8388.399 --> 8392.64
water there's atrin run off this level

8390.6 --> 8397.04
of atrin in this water well that will

8392.64 --> 8399.76
make frogs gay this much statistically

8397.04 --> 8399.76
and that's how they

8399.96 --> 8406.438999999998
know chemicals in the water are actually

8403.88 --> 8408.399
turning the frogs gay and it's not good

8406.439 --> 8412.16
because it's not just the the frogs that

8408.399 --> 8414.24
are getting turned gay from it it

8412.16 --> 8419.319
influences

8414.24 --> 8422.52
all like nonplant life all of it

8419.319 --> 8425.08
everything gets influenced by that like

8422.52 --> 8426.6
any type of creature that has a typical

8425.08 --> 8431.08
hormonal

8426.6 --> 8435.52
system like mammals birds and reptiles

8431.08 --> 8435.52
they will all like get influenced by

8437.88 --> 8441.88
it like like in that

8443.0 --> 8448.84
way I'm not I'm not as dumb as you think

8446.56 --> 8451.08
Bill n is not saying this for you I know

8448.84 --> 8453.08
you know this I'm saying this for

8451.08 --> 8455.439
anybody else watching that didn't know

8453.08 --> 8455.439
about

8456.24 --> 8462.479
this sometimes I do actually like to

8458.96 --> 8462.479
address newcomers that are

8468.64 --> 8473.8
watching right especially when I I draw

8471.439 --> 8475.720000000001
in a more General subject if I draw a

8473.8 --> 8477.64
more General subject I'm going to expect

8475.72 --> 8480.599999999999
a lot of newcomers to pay ATT attention

8477.64 --> 8482.64
to that cuz it's still new to them you

8480.6 --> 8485.68
old veterans that hang around in my chat

8482.64 --> 8487.68
I know you all heard that I know that

8485.68 --> 8489.76
it's not I'm not saying it for you I'm

8487.68 --> 8491.880000000001
saying it for other people watching that

8489.76 --> 8493.12
might have not heard about it like 20

8491.88 --> 8495.279999999999
times

8493.12 --> 8498.0
yet

8495.28 --> 8502.0
anyway I think it was

8498.0 --> 8502.0
because I was cor

8502.08 --> 8509.24
one

8503.96 --> 8509.24
call yeah what the [ __ ] was that

8510.04 --> 8515.240000000002
I heard that I I wasn't there when that

8512.96 --> 8517.679999999998
H what the hell happened there steamy

8515.24 --> 8517.68
Traver

8517.8 --> 8524.199999999999
adamin adamin mostly I I heard that

8521.24 --> 8528.8
something like that I don't know

8524.2 --> 8528.800000000001
I I I was not there when that

8529.8 --> 8533.64
happened right but I mean Friday

8531.96 --> 8537.839999999998
everything was

8533.64 --> 8540.84
hot mic was hot all the time like almost

8537.84 --> 8543.24
the entire show there were like at least

8540.84 --> 8545.76
three people talking at the same time

8543.24 --> 8548.6
kind of drove me up the

8545.76 --> 8550.800000000001
wall like

8548.6 --> 8554.479000000001
everybody's yeah everybody was

8550.8 --> 8558.56
interrupting everybody else halfway like

8554.479 --> 8558.56
everybody so just gave me a

8559.359 --> 8563.84
headache it was good to have everybody

8562.0 --> 8567.88
back though but holy [ __ ] did everybody

8563.84 --> 8569.479
have to be rompy being back and all that

8567.88 --> 8572.279999999999
like everybody was like yeah no I want

8569.479 --> 8573.92
to catch up oh so you all want to catch

8572.28 --> 8576.52
up do you

8573.92 --> 8580.16
oh oh then I guess that nobody's going

8576.52 --> 8580.16
to really hear what you all have to

8581.479 --> 8584.479
say

8596.08 --> 8599.08
anyway

8611.52 --> 8615.92
did I see Dr shiva's 60th birthday

8614.479 --> 8619.76
stream yes I

8615.92 --> 8623.279
did he was super late by the way like

8619.76 --> 8626.72
over an hour but yeah I caught some of

8623.279 --> 8631.52
that I said I did say speak up in the

8626.72 --> 8631.519999999999
chat a couple of times at the

8633.16 --> 8639.359
beginning and I did wish him happy

8635.319 --> 8639.359
birthday so yeah I did take notice of

8656.0 --> 8659.0
that

8674.88 --> 8683.0
yeah yeah Adam I know but I

8677.96 --> 8685.8
mean like I had remember that time with

8683.0 --> 8687.92
John like in the beginning when I was

8685.8 --> 8689.64
like when we both were kind of rolling

8687.92 --> 8692.319
out the whole thing like yeah we're not

8689.64 --> 8695.76
actually biblical

8692.319 --> 8699.08
Christians and then that one time

8695.76 --> 8701.479
like John reflected curvature like I

8699.08 --> 8704.72
said something wrong in his presence and

8701.479 --> 8707.8
he got like really Hellbound on me it

8704.72 --> 8709.96
felt like a a bulldog suddenly like bit

8707.8 --> 8714.438999999998
down on my leg and was just not going to

8709.96 --> 8717.399
let go was really creepy so John

8714.439 --> 8719.56
sometimes has these like Hellbound

8717.399 --> 8721.64
moments where he's just like like

8719.56 --> 8722.278999999999
latching on and like not letting go like

8721.64 --> 8724.92
a

8722.279 --> 8726.319000000001
bulldog he has those moments where and

8724.92 --> 8728.88
it really does feel like out of

8726.319 --> 8731.199999999999
character for him too when it

8728.88 --> 8733.8
happens so maybe that's the thing that

8731.2 --> 8736.399000000001
got triggered at him maybe it just like

8733.8 --> 8740.84
really got to him and he was like just

8736.399 --> 8745.72
like bite I don't trust you and he

8740.84 --> 8745.72
just try to bite your ankle and not let

8745.88 --> 8748.88
go

8752.399 --> 8761.08
that's why referring newbies to feds of

8755.439 --> 8764.479000000001
gamble they might catch a rumpa show no

8761.08 --> 8768.84
no I disagree it's good for them to

8764.479 --> 8771.84
witness that because it's part of

8768.84 --> 8775.12
it rassing is what you're going to have

8771.84 --> 8778.8
to deal with if you wish to learn about

8775.12 --> 8778.800000000001
Flat Earth and discuss it

8785.56 --> 8790.479
publicly

8787.52 --> 8793.960000000001
right you can't protect

8790.479 --> 8796.84
newbies from the crazy rassing

8793.96 --> 8798.8
forever it's like you want to be a flat

8796.84 --> 8801.439
earther well you're going you're going

8798.8 --> 8804.24
to have to learn what you face then

8801.439 --> 8807.12
you're going to face people that that

8804.24 --> 8808.8
talk over you that never agree with with

8807.12 --> 8811.52
you even though they might agree with

8808.8 --> 8814.08
you later about the same thing because

8811.52 --> 8816.24
then they needed to agree with it you're

8814.08 --> 8819.2
going to deal with all this crazy

8816.24 --> 8822.08
psychological maneuvering and projecting

8819.2 --> 8825.08
and false accusations personal

8822.08 --> 8826.56
ATT that's what you're going to face and

8825.08 --> 8829.52
you have

8826.56 --> 8832.16
to be honest about that you have you

8829.52 --> 8834.2
can't protect the newbies from that they

8832.16 --> 8837.92
have to know like this is what happens

8834.2 --> 8840.399000000001
it's a big part of learning to deal with

8837.92 --> 8843.12
it you can't just say oh no it's all

8840.399 --> 8845.0
flat Earth it's all cool man because

8843.12 --> 8847.439
they'll be like oh man I learned about

8845.0 --> 8849.479
Flat Earth is so cool and then it's like

8847.439 --> 8853.6
how dare you I'm going to disown you

8849.479 --> 8855.72
like yeah because they weren't informed

8853.6 --> 8857.76
that yeah the people get crazy over that

8855.72 --> 8860.08
you have to be careful with who you're

8857.76 --> 8863.56
going to talk about it

8860.08 --> 8867.52
with they need to be informed about that

8863.56 --> 8870.479
so rassing yeah it's good it's good to

8867.52 --> 8870.479000000001
see that that

8871.64 --> 8876.519999999999
happens right you don't want to every

8874.359 --> 8879.08
show to have that happen to have a

8876.52 --> 8881.84
rassing [ __ ] rumpus everything you

8879.08 --> 8883.2
don't want that all the time but it's

8881.84 --> 8885.92
good to

8883.2 --> 8889.720000000001
to have

8885.92 --> 8891.84
that seen by newcomers they have to know

8889.72 --> 8894.92
that that also

8891.84 --> 8897.24
happens right because Flat Earth is not

8894.92 --> 8899.68
just about figuring out what is what how

8897.24 --> 8901.279
does it work how have you been fooled

8899.68 --> 8905.2
it's also

8901.279 --> 8908.720000000001
dealing with the the craziness it brings

8905.2 --> 8911.08
out in people that don't accept

8908.72 --> 8916.199999999999
it for what it really

8911.08 --> 8918.96
is you have to be informed about that

8916.2 --> 8921.6
before you get into it otherwise it's

8918.96 --> 8924.438999999998
not fair otherwise they'll get an really

8921.6 --> 8927.319
unexpected terrible

8924.439 --> 8929.92
surprise on the other side

8927.319 --> 8932.6
you don't want to do that to people like

8929.92 --> 8934.24
they'll hate you for that yeah you give

8932.6 --> 8935.84
them all this Flat Earth ideas it's like

8934.24 --> 8938.84
oh super cool and they're like wow this

8935.84 --> 8941.8
is awesome and you don't tell them about

8938.84 --> 8944.12
the negative sides of it and then they

8941.8 --> 8945.84
bump into that find about it out their

8944.12 --> 8948.640000000001
yourself they might have just publicly

8945.84 --> 8951.319
embarrassed themselves with it they're

8948.64 --> 8954.16
going to resent you for that that you

8951.319 --> 8955.92
didn't War them that you thought that

8954.16 --> 8957.88
they that you made them believe that

8955.92 --> 8961.92
Flat Earth is it's all cool and it's all

8957.88 --> 8964.199999999999
awesome and just a relief and we're free

8961.92 --> 8966.319
yeah but you also now have to deal with

8964.2 --> 8969.720000000001
these [ __ ] up people that that hate

8966.319 --> 8974.199999999999
Flat Earth you have to be honest about

8969.72 --> 8976.76
that in the beginning not in the end or

8974.2 --> 8979.16
let them find out you have to be honest

8976.76 --> 8981.64
about that in the beginning otherwise

8979.16 --> 8981.64
it's really

8982.399 --> 8989.439
mean I mean people's lives have social

8986.08 --> 8992.76
lives is special have been completely

8989.439 --> 8995.359
disintegrated because of Flat Earth you

8992.76 --> 8998.279
need to be honest about

8995.359 --> 9001.76
that with

8998.279 --> 9003.560000000001
newcomers that it's not just easy peasy

9001.76 --> 9006.960000000001
just like the Press of a button you're a

9003.56 --> 9009.88
flat Earth and everything is cool

9006.96 --> 9013.88
no there's

9009.88 --> 9016.64
risks there social friction that will

9013.88 --> 9018.399
happen and they need to be informed

9016.64 --> 9022.76
about that they need to be

9018.399 --> 9025.84
given a choice an all honest balanced

9022.76 --> 9028.479
choice on what to do with the

9025.84 --> 9030.04
information of Flat Earth like are they

9028.479 --> 9032.599999999999
going to accept it are they going to

9030.04 --> 9033.720000000001
tolerate it and maybe put it in the back

9032.6 --> 9035.92
of the mind because they don't really

9033.72 --> 9038.438999999998
want to deal with it but still when it

9035.92 --> 9041.64
comes around be tolerable about be very

9038.439 --> 9045.439
tolerant and accepting like not get

9041.64 --> 9048.08
friction not not be angry against it

9045.439 --> 9051.64
right

9048.08 --> 9056.56
people need to learn how to deal with

9051.64 --> 9058.56
it as a subject socially like

9056.56 --> 9061.08
psychologically because Flat Earth is

9058.56 --> 9064.519999999999
not just about the math about the

9061.08 --> 9067.359
geometry about how does this all fit the

9064.52 --> 9069.960000000001
history the physics how does it actually

9067.359 --> 9074.6
work no it's not just about that that's

9069.96 --> 9077.479
like half of it and the other half is

9074.6 --> 9078.880000000001
psychological how do B Believers keep

9077.479 --> 9082.08
believing the

9078.88 --> 9086.479
ball the only way to figure that out is

9082.08 --> 9088.6
by studying the psychology of it then

9086.479 --> 9090.358999999999
you start to see it like what's actually

9088.6 --> 9093.12
happening inside of their heads how do

9090.359 --> 9095.16
they come to these conclusions how does

9093.12 --> 9097.640000000001
that

9095.16 --> 9099.88
work and that's really more like a

9097.64 --> 9102.76
specialist thing it's like for advanced

9099.88 --> 9104.759999999998
flat earthers you can't be expected to

9102.76 --> 9106.479
immediately understand the psychology of

9104.76 --> 9109.72
a baller when you just get into flat

9106.479 --> 9112.8
Earth it's a long-term studying

9109.72 --> 9116.08
process takes thick skin to get

9112.8 --> 9118.278999999999
there and I'm glad to say that I've

9116.08 --> 9121.96
definitely gone there and so has Nathan

9118.279 --> 9125.359
Oakley and us two together we discuss

9121.96 --> 9129.759999999998
baller psychology regularly on the live

9125.359 --> 9132.720000000001
show very happy about that that we have

9129.76 --> 9135.800000000001
that but you don't just get there right

9132.72 --> 9138.039999999999
away it takes it takes a lot of getting

9135.8 --> 9140.64
used to and

9138.04 --> 9143.800000000001
studying like studying people not

9140.64 --> 9146.96
reading books studying the people that

9143.8 --> 9146.96
that's where you learn about

9148.08 --> 9153.039999999999
it yeah act like adults over this

9150.56 --> 9153.039999999999
subject

9157.52 --> 9160.52
definitely

9164.359 --> 9169.359
right the newes the newbies aren't quite

9167.359 --> 9173.12
ready

9169.359 --> 9174.960000000001
yeah there is no beef good no I don't

9173.12 --> 9177.279
think that John really has beef with

9174.96 --> 9181.919999999998
people that

9177.279 --> 9181.92
much but sometimes he can be a little

9183.479 --> 9189.319
bitey it's almost like cows can get

9187.2 --> 9191.240000000002
bitey like normally they're just like

9189.319 --> 9193.8
all right nice and then sometimes they

9191.24 --> 9198.16
just like want to bite on things walk up

9193.8 --> 9198.16
in your bite you in the ass or something

9198.319 --> 9204.92
right John has that too sometimes I feel

9202.08 --> 9204.92
he gets a little

9211.279 --> 9217.2
bitey ever had that like horses or I

9215.08 --> 9219.319
think it's usually horses that like when

9217.2 --> 9221.08
they get in weird mood they try to bite

9219.319 --> 9223.359
sneak up on you on the back and then

9221.08 --> 9225.16
bite you in the ass can be really

9223.359 --> 9226.880000000001
painful too by the

9225.16 --> 9229.88
way

9226.88 --> 9232.039999999999
I've seen people get pretty hurt like

9229.88 --> 9233.92
bloody hurt over that because the when

9232.04 --> 9237.439
the horse did that they actually by

9233.92 --> 9240.0
accident like bit into the flashh that

9237.439 --> 9240.0
was [ __ ]

9241.479 --> 9248.8
up but I mean horses can be pretty

9245.439 --> 9248.800000000001
sadistic some of

9248.96 --> 9255.08
them horses got Grapplers too you know

9252.64 --> 9258.479
they got grabler

9255.08 --> 9261.2
horses I used to ride one and that was

9258.479 --> 9264.278999999999
like a really smart horse but he was

9261.2 --> 9266.6
like really like yeah nobody tells me

9264.279 --> 9266.6
what to

9266.72 --> 9274.679999999998
do because because like he just like he

9272.88 --> 9277.72
just like he could do

9274.68 --> 9281.800000000001
anything but he would only do something

9277.72 --> 9285.119999999999
after he basically refused to do it

9281.8 --> 9286.8
first and then when he felt for me like

9285.12 --> 9289.2
I didn't care anymore or that was too

9286.8 --> 9292.519999999999
late then he would do it perfectly cuz

9289.2 --> 9296.6
he was just like this grabler

9292.52 --> 9299.720000000001
horse cheeky bastard could do anything

9296.6 --> 9303.439
but he'd only do it on his own

9299.72 --> 9306.039999999999
terms it's very hard to control that one

9303.439 --> 9308.720000000001
but hey I was one of the like few guys

9306.04 --> 9311.439
that actually tried doing that most

9308.72 --> 9314.519999999999
people avoided that horse like the

9311.439 --> 9318.0
plague he threw a lot of people off his

9314.52 --> 9318.0
back too

9325.92 --> 9331.16
laughing at their psychology right like

9328.88 --> 9332.839999999998
QE life yesterday the treatment I mean

9331.16 --> 9335.0
that's exactly what it is like

9332.84 --> 9337.8
psychological study and

9335.0 --> 9340.88
laughing it's comedy and psychology at

9337.8 --> 9343.72
the same time do I miss writing horses

9340.88 --> 9343.72
yeah I kind of

9344.96 --> 9349.679999999998
do

9347.72 --> 9352.84
but I mean I don't want to ride horses

9349.68 --> 9352.84
alone that would be

9354.08 --> 9360.8
lame but it would be freaking awesome if

9357.52 --> 9364.279
I'd have like a girlfriendwife

9360.8 --> 9367.24
who I do that with like that would be

9364.279 --> 9367.24
just so

9374.92 --> 9377.92
awesome

9383.04 --> 9386.04
but

9386.399 --> 9393.439
yeah you know I

9390.279 --> 9395.6
mean maybe it'll get there one day again

9393.439 --> 9398.68
but I mean in the meantime my country is

9395.6 --> 9402.52
in pretty severe decline from what

9398.68 --> 9405.92
seemed like a peak of of

9402.52 --> 9409.319000000001
wealth but it's in Decline and like it's

9405.92 --> 9413.399
severely corrupted by outside forces by

9409.319 --> 9416.6
Marxist forces basically so I don't know

9413.399 --> 9419.72
if we'll ever get back there like if I

9416.6 --> 9423.12
ever get in a position again where I

9419.72 --> 9423.119999999999
could like do horseback

9423.52 --> 9429.84
riding I don't

9425.6 --> 9432.04
know I hope I will but I'm not counting

9429.84 --> 9432.04
on

9434.8 --> 9437.8
it

9439.279 --> 9444.2
I mostly hope that there's still going

9440.92 --> 9445.2
to be like riding horses and places for

9444.2 --> 9448.800000000001
that

9445.2 --> 9451.52
around right because if the economy goes

9448.8 --> 9454.84
really really sour then how do any of

9451.52 --> 9456.08
the these places manage to keep existing

9454.84 --> 9458.68
you

9456.08 --> 9461.0
know horseback riding is pretty damn

9458.68 --> 9463.16
expensive really like horses have a lot

9461.0 --> 9463.16
of

9464.8 --> 9467.8
maintenance

9475.84 --> 9480.479
right

9477.96 --> 9482.96
anyway I think I'm going to move towards

9480.479 --> 9486.72
rounding out the show not sure yet could

9482.96 --> 9488.759999999998
go on a little longer but it's it's

9486.72 --> 9492.8
freaking

9488.76 --> 9495.399
dark it's dark it's just freaking dark

9492.8 --> 9498.84
it's dark as dark can be like you can

9495.399 --> 9502.88
literally see the reflection of my room

9498.84 --> 9502.880000000001
in the window now it's that freaking

9503.65 --> 9509.56
[Music]

9506.72 --> 9515.789999999999
dark right

9509.56 --> 9520.059
so and it's 15 past 5

9515.79 --> 9520.059000000001
[Music]

9524.72 --> 9527.72
p.m.

9532.56 --> 9538.359
what are you saying lame for by the way

9534.68 --> 9541.52
Gideon sick response to

9538.359 --> 9547.2
what horseback

9541.52 --> 9551.319000000001
riding I hope not oh so much maintenance

9547.2 --> 9551.319000000001
yeah yeah it is what it is you

9554.64 --> 9563.0
know I mean horses are big animals

9559.399 --> 9565.96
yeah right and you can't really milk

9563.0 --> 9565.96
them like

9566.64 --> 9574.84
cows so it's like yeah a horse is

9570.8 --> 9574.84
technically more expensive than a

9575.399 --> 9582.68
car right it's a car that requires

9578.6 --> 9582.68
maintenance whether you drive them or

9582.76 --> 9587.64
not because it's going to have to keep

9587.96 --> 9595.72
feeding even when it's not running a

9592.439 --> 9595.720000000001
lot right

9602.319 --> 9607.84
anyway but horses are still great

9604.96 --> 9609.16
especially like if you're in the milder

9607.84 --> 9612.84
temperature

9609.16 --> 9615.279
areas it really freezes a

9612.84 --> 9618.479
lot yeah you could still do it but it's

9615.279 --> 9621.439
going to be more hassle more hazards but

9618.479 --> 9623.72
like moderate climates are like perfect

9621.439 --> 9623.720000000001
for

9624.24 --> 9628.68
horses not too cold not too

9638.92 --> 9643.960000000001
hot you're talking about horses and yeah

9642.0 --> 9649.56
that was my qu

9643.96 --> 9649.56
what and you said ah it's lame

9665.96 --> 9671.679999999998
what oh I don't remember what I said

9668.68 --> 9674.439
it's lame in response to but I mean I

9671.68 --> 9677.439
don't think horse back riding is

9674.439 --> 9677.439
lame

9681.439 --> 9686.720000000001
it's just yeah expensive like most

9684.12 --> 9691.08
Hobbies like Great Hobbies it is a great

9686.72 --> 9691.08
hobby especially if you have like

9692.399 --> 9697.24
a a place where they're like really

9695.08 --> 9700.479
serious where where they're like almost

9697.24 --> 9702.479
military about it and not just like oh

9700.479 --> 9707.0
we're just here to entertain little

9702.479 --> 9709.519999999999
girls oh fall off oh no not the the the

9707.0 --> 9713.88
the [ __ ] type Harback riding but when I

9709.52 --> 9718.319000000001
got Harback riding I had like a like a

9713.88 --> 9720.679999999998
farmer like a farmer guy and he's like

9718.319 --> 9724.0
like doesn't give a [ __ ] so he's like he

9720.68 --> 9727.24
would like make you like push

9724.0 --> 9729.16
it seek out the borders and like you

9727.24 --> 9732.84
could never give up like there was this

9729.16 --> 9736.0
rule if you get thrown off your horse

9732.84 --> 9738.68
and you're not like seriously hurt

9736.0 --> 9741.72
if you don't get back on that horse

9738.68 --> 9744.68
immediately you can never come

9741.72 --> 9747.76
back yeah that was their

9744.68 --> 9751.24
rule I thought it was freaking

9747.76 --> 9753.319
badass so I was like yeah I'm taking

9751.24 --> 9755.96
that challenge I'm doing this and then I

9753.319 --> 9757.72
got on like the toughest horses there

9755.96 --> 9759.358999999999
they would like always obsess over

9757.72 --> 9762.399
throwing you off and

9759.359 --> 9766.12
[ __ ] I got there for the challenge man I

9762.399 --> 9769.08
loved it I've been like I've made quite

9766.12 --> 9770.479000000001
a few arcs flying through the air and

9769.08 --> 9777.08
landing in the

9770.479 --> 9777.08
dirt in my teens early teens quite a few

9784.2 --> 9790.359
times it was meant like horses are lamb

9787.84 --> 9792.08
lame yeah well when a horses lame they

9790.359 --> 9794.279
they usually get

9792.08 --> 9797.279
euthanized

9794.279 --> 9797.279
so

9802.64 --> 9810.24
yeah you made a pun T would be what pun

9806.319 --> 9811.88
did I make did I make a pun sorry

9810.24 --> 9816.359
sometimes I just make puns and don't

9811.88 --> 9816.358999999999
even consciously realize it just

9824.279 --> 9827.279
happens

9849.0 --> 9854.2
okay whatever you guys are now talking

9850.96 --> 9856.039999999999
about I I don't get it

9854.2 --> 9859.319000000001
anymore

9856.04 --> 9866.92
do you sub

9859.319 --> 9866.92
subscribe do you subscribe to the IM

9867.279 --> 9877.359
map no dup I do not so

9873.279 --> 9877.359
subscribe to the I

9879.88 --> 9886.0
map all maps are projections anyway and

9882.88 --> 9888.24
then none of them are of a consistent

9886.0 --> 9890.92
scale

9888.24 --> 9893.92
throughout no map is an accurate

9890.92 --> 9897.6
representation of the actual terrain

9893.92 --> 9902.6
duper no map that I've seen

9897.6 --> 9902.6
ever yes duper I know I'm

9910.16 --> 9917.52
just it's just my way of like Anor

9915.12 --> 9920.479000000001
encouraging you to make more effort to

9917.52 --> 9920.479000000001
spell things

9921.84 --> 9926.399
correctly that's how I do it it's just

9924.439 --> 9928.64
like oh oh You misspelled it did you

9926.399 --> 9931.84
okay well then I'm going to say it

9928.64 --> 9935.519999999999
misspelled out loud multiple

9931.84 --> 9938.72
times so that you know that next time

9935.52 --> 9942.479000000001
yeah maybe you should really not

9938.72 --> 9942.479
misspell it and just leave it like

9944.08 --> 9947.08
that

9954.319 --> 9960.319
does anyone in fed subscribe to the AE

9956.76 --> 9960.319
map no I don't think

9960.84 --> 9967.84
so none of us claim at fed that the map

9965.64 --> 9971.199999999999
is an accurate representation of the

9967.84 --> 9974.52
terrain all that we do claim is that all

9971.2 --> 9977.240000000002
maps are Globe projections which were

9974.52 --> 9979.08
derived from a flat plane versus the

9977.24 --> 9983.52
celestial

9979.08 --> 9986.279
sphere so we will all tell you that all

9983.52 --> 9990.08
maps are based of globe projections that

9986.279 --> 9990.08
were created using a flat

10000.6 --> 10007.0
plane can you

10004.0 --> 10007.0
follow

10010.76 --> 10015.359
oh wow I completely

10013.08 --> 10018.279
forgot at the beginning of the show I

10015.359 --> 10021.319
was going to say like about kwi

10018.279 --> 10023.720000000001
live with fight the flat earth like the

10021.319 --> 10025.84
reasoning that he had oh wait did I say

10023.72 --> 10028.08
it Adam were you there at the beginning

10025.84 --> 10030.0
of the show I want I want you to hear

10028.08 --> 10032.039999999999
this don't know if you noticed me

10030.0 --> 10035.24
yesterday in the chat with qy live

10032.04 --> 10039.52
probably too late started at 2:00 p.m.

10035.24 --> 10042.68
here so uh but yeah according to Craig

10039.52 --> 10047.0
it's like we know the reasoning he had

10042.68 --> 10049.68
about gravity causing the force of

10047.0 --> 10052.439
gravity right and the proof of that

10049.68 --> 10056.0
would be a gravitational

10052.439 --> 10059.880000000001
wave but if gravitation is a

10056.0 --> 10062.279
wave then what's the medium for the

10059.88 --> 10063.119999999999
gravitational wave in order for it to be

10062.279 --> 10065.52
a

10063.12 --> 10069.240000000002
wave and I figured it out

10065.52 --> 10073.2
out what else would the medium for the

10069.24 --> 10074.72
gravitational wave be but

10073.2 --> 10078.279
gravity

10074.72 --> 10081.278999999999
right so gravity not only is a non force

10078.279 --> 10085.68
that causes the force of gravity it is

10081.279 --> 10089.04
also the medium for the gravitational

10085.68 --> 10093.279
wave and it's not only the medium for

10089.04 --> 10097.720000000001
the gravitational wave the medium also

10093.279 --> 10097.720000000001
causes the grav vitational

10098.439 --> 10104.04
wave

10100.2 --> 10107.359
woohoo see how it all works

10104.04 --> 10108.960000000001
out it really makes sense if you don't

10107.359 --> 10112.6
think about it too

10108.96 --> 10114.319
carefully but I mean it does really make

10112.6 --> 10118.24
sense

10114.319 --> 10120.479
artistically wouldn't you say Adam right

10118.24 --> 10122.72
so the non-force of gravity causes the

10120.479 --> 10126.0
force of gravity and the proof for this

10122.72 --> 10129.319
is gravitational waves and the medium

10126.0 --> 10133.8
for the gravitational wave that causes

10129.319 --> 10138.278999999999
the gravitational wave too is

10133.8 --> 10138.278999999999
gravity and now the circle is

10145.56 --> 10150.64
complete I finally understand what

10148.16 --> 10150.64
gravity

10153.72 --> 10156.72
is

10159.2 --> 10165.560000000001
are you still there Adam or did you just

10161.56 --> 10165.56
like choke and fall over or

10180.56 --> 10183.56
something

10183.72 --> 10187.16
okay

10185.11 --> 10191.0
[Music]

10187.16 --> 10196.68
I guess it's the the time of the

10191.0 --> 10200.92
day SpaceTime is the medium yes no you

10196.68 --> 10201.68
see gravity non Force creates the force

10200.92 --> 10204.52
of

10201.68 --> 10208.08
gravity but the evidence for that is a

10204.52 --> 10210.92
gravitational wave but since it's a wave

10208.08 --> 10213.64
that means there has to be a medium for

10210.92 --> 10216.84
the gravitational

10213.64 --> 10221.439
wave so what else could the medium for

10216.84 --> 10224.52
the gravitational wave be but Gravity

10221.439 --> 10228.359
the SpaceTime bending itself is the

10224.52 --> 10231.640000000001
medium for the gravitational wave which

10228.359 --> 10235.08
is a force created by the non force of

10231.64 --> 10238.96
gravity so the medium is gravity and the

10235.08 --> 10241.8
medium causes the force of gravity in

10238.96 --> 10246.039999999999
the form of a gravitational

10241.8 --> 10249.358999999999
wave I mean it's bre brilliant it's

10246.04 --> 10252.2
absolutely foolproof if you just don't

10249.359 --> 10252.2
think about it too

10263.2 --> 10270.6
detailed no dupons no toal field that's

10267.08 --> 10270.6
all a bunch of hippie dippies

10271.12 --> 10276.560000000001
talk and I don't mean seeking starwater

10273.96 --> 10279.358999999999
hippie talk maybe it is I don't know but

10276.56 --> 10282.039999999999
yeah thidal Fields is all nonsense it's

10279.359 --> 10282.04
all disc

10282.08 --> 10287.039999999999
reification yes gravity causes the force

10285.68 --> 10290.84
of

10287.04 --> 10293.800000000001
gravity it's also the medium for the

10290.84 --> 10296.76
force of gravity and because gravity is

10293.8 --> 10299.64
the medium it causes the force of

10296.76 --> 10301.72
gravity to Ripple which we know as a

10299.64 --> 10305.8
gravitational

10301.72 --> 10308.239
wave it all fits it's the most

10305.8 --> 10311.519999999999
nonsensical mechanism I've ever

10308.239 --> 10314.319
conceived of but it works if you don't

10311.52 --> 10314.319000000001
think about it too

10315.04 --> 10318.52
hard it's the

10328.6 --> 10335.92
solution I'm genuinely smiling over this

10332.56 --> 10338.199999999999
what do you think Adam

10335.92 --> 10342.68
I mean this could definitely fool ball

10338.2 --> 10344.960000000001
Believers couldn't it it could really do

10342.68 --> 10347.16
that I mean fight the Flat Earth is

10344.96 --> 10352.479
already halfway

10347.16 --> 10354.84
there all he needs to do is close the

10352.479 --> 10357.92
loop and and it

10354.84 --> 10360.68
works Gravity the non force causes the

10357.92 --> 10364.279
force of gravity it's

10360.68 --> 10367.479000000001
also the medium for the force of gravity

10364.279 --> 10372.319000000001
with which expresses itself as a

10367.479 --> 10374.96
ripple in the form of a gravitational

10372.319 --> 10378.039999999999
wave beautiful ballock here thank you

10374.96 --> 10381.72
Adam I really app I I

10378.04 --> 10381.720000000001
know I know that's

10384.2 --> 10389.52
serious but I'm gonna I'm going to carry

10386.84 --> 10392.479
this I'm tomorrow's show is going to

10389.52 --> 10395.52
have this title I got to put it I mean

10392.479 --> 10400.88
this is the new way

10395.52 --> 10403.68
this is the new road for the ball it's

10400.88 --> 10408.438999999998
the only road you can go I finally found

10403.68 --> 10410.64
a way through I finally found how I F

10408.439 --> 10414.12
finally figured out how to properly

10410.64 --> 10415.599999999999
define gravity in all its forms and how

10414.12 --> 10418.76
it

10415.6 --> 10421.439
connects and this is

10418.76 --> 10424.6
it I guess fight to Flat Earth was

10421.439 --> 10426.56
really right after all he just he he

10424.6 --> 10429.2
couldn't bring it all the way he didn't

10426.56 --> 10433.479
see the rest of it I see it

10429.2 --> 10436.2
now I finally understand what gravity

10433.479 --> 10439.56
is it's a non

10436.2 --> 10440.439
force that creates a force in the form

10439.56 --> 10444.56
of a

10440.439 --> 10449.399
ripple a gravitational wave and gravity

10444.56 --> 10453.278999999999
is the medium for that gravitational

10449.399 --> 10455.96
wave so it's both the medium and the

10453.279 --> 10458.68
cause

10455.96 --> 10458.679999999998
isn't that just

10482.84 --> 10488.68
amazing medium cause and effect yeah

10488.92 --> 10494.76
technically but that's the the force of

10491.399 --> 10496.8
GRA gravity is the effect of course but

10494.76 --> 10498.72
the coolest thing is that this relation

10496.8 --> 10501.88
as to how this relates to space-time

10498.72 --> 10506.0
bending non-force gravity and now it's

10501.88 --> 10508.239
complete because now it is not just one

10506.0 --> 10511.279
mysterious way it

10508.239 --> 10515.119999999999
connects it it connects in multiple ways

10511.279 --> 10519.92
it even explains how gravity can be

10515.12 --> 10524.0
wave yeah I mean nobody's ever

10519.92 --> 10526.439
addressed gravity being a wave would

10524.0 --> 10529.16
yeah would make it

10526.439 --> 10531.52
require a medium for it so what's the

10529.16 --> 10533.84
medium for gravitational wave well it

10531.52 --> 10537.239
could only be one thing of course how

10533.84 --> 10542.439
could I not see this before the medium

10537.239 --> 10546.88
for a gravitational wave is

10542.439 --> 10546.880000000001
gravity and the circle is now

10553.88 --> 10558.839999999998
complete right and that with that note

10556.76 --> 10561.72
I'm going to round out hope you all

10558.84 --> 10564.6
enjoyed the show Almost 3

10561.72 --> 10567.84
hours it was certainly a blast to me

10564.6 --> 10569.960000000001
lots of fun I'm glad I was able to put

10567.84 --> 10572.72
this down so you could all think about

10569.96 --> 10575.199999999999
this and know the

10572.72 --> 10577.8
future only

10575.2 --> 10579.92
Flat Earth early be show where you get

10577.8 --> 10581.519999999999
to learn about the future before

10579.92 --> 10584.8
