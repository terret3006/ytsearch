80.72 --> 85.119
yeah i thought yesterday was hot well

83.68 --> 88.159
today

85.119 --> 89.439
it happens to be 5 degrees celsius

88.159 --> 92.32000000000001
hotter

89.439 --> 94.24
it's literally 33 degrees right now

92.32 --> 98.55999999999999
celsius

94.24 --> 100.079
and yeah i almost considered for a

98.56 --> 103.68
moment just stopping

100.079 --> 108.72
or not starting the show because

103.68 --> 111.36000000000001
it's it's so hot it's becoming like

108.72 --> 113.52
well it's now only just becoming a

111.36 --> 116.88
little bit more bearable in here because

113.52 --> 117.6
before this i was literally nauseated

116.88 --> 120.96
from the heat

117.6 --> 122.33
just from the heat itself

120.96 --> 124.79899999999999
and

122.33 --> 128.07999999999998
[Music]

124.799 --> 130.399
i got a foot bath though helps a

128.08 --> 132.239
little but it's just this heat is

130.399 --> 136.56
intolerable

132.239 --> 140.84
oh i even forgot to get my drinks

136.56 --> 143.84
maybe i should get some of that hold on

140.84 --> 143.84
guys

190.4 --> 197.92000000000002
alright so i got some

195.04 --> 200.48
multi-fruit juice and yeah there's

197.92 --> 203.67999999999998
carrot in there i don't know

200.48 --> 203.67999999999998
i thought i'd try it out

206.56 --> 209.76
to be fair at this moment i don't really

208.799 --> 211.84
feel like

209.76 --> 213.67999999999998
taking anything because i'm just

211.84 --> 216.48
nauseated

213.68 --> 216.48000000000002
from the heat

222.0 --> 228.72
okay obamacare

225.04 --> 228.72
i hope to see you soon again

229.2 --> 236.64
you need to get a fan it's no no

232.56 --> 240.879
it no it it it'd probably make it worse

236.64 --> 243.76
it would just blow the heat around

240.879 --> 245.04
because everything is warm like

243.76 --> 248.72
everything

245.04 --> 249.28
like even having to get on the balcony

248.72 --> 251.68
here

249.28 --> 255.04
like everything is so incredibly hot it

251.68 --> 255.04000000000002
literally is painful

255.519 --> 259.919
yeah say in the shadow

262.479 --> 268.24
you can be my fans okay

266.16 --> 269.52000000000004
it's not gonna make it any cooler though

268.24 --> 272.639
but

269.52 --> 273.12
yeah so sorry guys but i think that i'm

272.639 --> 276.8
gonna be

273.12 --> 276.8
like ultra slow today

277.44 --> 283.6
i hope that i can even think of

281.52 --> 284.71999999999997
just an interesting thing to put out

283.6 --> 287.199
because i'm just so

284.72 --> 287.199
hot i

288.32 --> 291.36
can't think straight

291.84 --> 301.35999999999996
anyway yeah let's see who's in chat

297.759 --> 304.24

305.68 --> 311.84000000000003

335.68 --> 340.72
george sanford dank sarita constantino

344.96 --> 348.96

348.96 --> 358.23999999999995
seen you in a while

353.039 --> 358.24
i think i got you all oh

358.88 --> 363.6
i'm gonna turn the door open here maybe

365.68 --> 369.919
a little bit of wind might be good

372.479 --> 377.019
some air flow

373.85 --> 377.019
[Music]

377.919 --> 381.84
hey eagle playing anchor

383.68 --> 389.36
uh he was here yesterday too

386.96 --> 389.35999999999996
anyway

390.96 --> 395.84
i barely made any notes to be fair

396.56 --> 400.24
flatter debates was really good

398.4 --> 403.35999999999996
basically a continuation of

400.24 --> 406.88
yesterday or of the day before

403.36 --> 410.16
got on to the same discussion again

406.88 --> 412.479
about the creation story and

410.16 --> 414.0
10th man and paul weren't going along

412.479 --> 416.24
with it and

414.0 --> 417.44
nathan and chocolate were with me on it

416.24 --> 423.84000000000003
and yeah

417.44 --> 423.84
kept on going until very late

435.12 --> 438.24
hey nicholas riddle

438.4 --> 444.23999999999995
uh anyway yeah after that owen benjamin

444.56 --> 450.96
it was a pretty good show lots of gravy

448.72 --> 453.84000000000003
and like his whole theme was with bane

450.96 --> 453.84
and just the whole

454.16 --> 458.639
metaphorical situation basically

457.68 --> 462.56
portraying

458.639 --> 466.08
bane as a rothschild in the situ

462.56 --> 469.36
i it was good it was complex my brain is

466.08 --> 469.35999999999996
just too melted to

470.16 --> 479.84000000000003
put it all down as i said i'm really

474.08 --> 479.84
this is i've just overheated here

485.12 --> 488.639
just lets in the heat right

490.56 --> 497.28000000000003
well you know the heat is now is now

494.0 --> 500.4
retracting since the the the sun angle

497.28 --> 502.79999999999995
is becoming

500.4 --> 504.15999999999997
parallel to the side of the house so

502.8 --> 507.36
it's no longer hitting

504.16 --> 510.0
the wall you know that always happens

507.36 --> 512.08
like roughly after two o'clock so

510.0 --> 516.08
but like that whole time before this

512.08 --> 519.9190000000001
it's just been so insanely hot here

516.08 --> 521.519
that yeah basically lay down on the

519.919 --> 523.8389999999999
couch below because there's

521.519 --> 526.5600000000001
it's a little cooler there and there is

523.839 --> 528.399
a couch so just lay on it

526.56 --> 535.8389999999999
i really feel kind of like doing that

528.399 --> 535.839
right now

549.279 --> 552.32
right here we go again i don't know how

550.959 --> 556.2399999999999
humid it is but

552.32 --> 563.839
it's the the heat is just undeniable

556.24 --> 563.839
33 degrees

576.0 --> 580.48
yeah tiny wumble well my windows are

578.24 --> 591.839
covered

580.48 --> 591.839
or have been covered in the morning

617.36 --> 623.04
that's very gracious of you here we go

619.44 --> 626.1600000000001
again but yeah it's kind of pointless

623.04 --> 626.16
i'll just sit here

628.16 --> 632.0
maybe not say a lot but hey if somebody

631.2 --> 635.12
brings something up

632.0 --> 635.12
and it gets me rolling

635.36 --> 639.92
maybe after a few minutes we'll have a

644.839 --> 647.839
show

652.56 --> 656.64
it is kind of odd you know because i

655.04 --> 660.16
feel really tired now

656.64 --> 663.4399999999999
like really like oh almost like fade

660.16 --> 665.279
tired but i've slept pretty well

663.44 --> 666.72
pretty long and everything didn't come

665.279 --> 669.76
any sleep so short it's

666.72 --> 669.76
just a pure heat

671.76 --> 675.04
making coffee yeah i haven't had any

673.6 --> 677.6800000000001
coffee

675.04 --> 679.68
so i'm not gonna even try that like

677.68 --> 680.2399999999999
yesterday the coffee was already a bit

679.68 --> 682.56
too much

680.24 --> 684.72
well today i it's like not even gonna

682.56 --> 689.5999999999999
try it

684.72 --> 703.839
so anyway maybe this stuff will

689.6 --> 703.839
be nice

714.839 --> 717.839
uh

730.01 --> 741.92
[Music]

738.48 --> 742.32
huh here we go again no i did not see

741.92 --> 746.079
that

742.32 --> 749.36
but i did catch for fia

746.079 --> 752.399
infowars that

749.36 --> 754.32
well from yeah i said it like even when

752.399 --> 756.72
i first reported on the whole lebanon

754.32 --> 758.32
situation that it was kind of suspicious

756.72 --> 760.24
and that

758.32 --> 762.399
it's a crazy situation if it was

760.24 --> 766.16
actually actually an accident well

762.399 --> 768.079
over at infowars the people there are

766.16 --> 769.519
they've kind of like already settled

768.079 --> 772.6389999999999
that it it has

769.519 --> 774.88
it had to be a terror attack

772.639 --> 777.2
or a secret service kind of blow up

774.88 --> 779.68
situation compared

777.2 --> 781.76
to the oklahoma bombing or something the

779.68 --> 787.8389999999999
oakland moment whatever

781.76 --> 787.8389999999999
so they are just calling it just that

788.56 --> 793.04
yeah yeah that's right

793.12 --> 800.16
i guess he did and

796.959 --> 804.8
yeah in retrospect

800.16 --> 804.8
yet there is something to it

807.68 --> 815.8389999999999
and yeah that's complex

816.48 --> 824.399
come on stop whining about that please

820.72 --> 824.399
it all has to do with anything

824.8 --> 828.959
yeah and i work for the new newspaper

828.639 --> 842.16
too

828.959 --> 844.399
i spread it yeah

842.16 --> 844.399
hmm

845.6 --> 851.6
okay that's that's nice it's a little

849.279 --> 851.6
sweet

851.92 --> 858.56
maybe it's a bit too sweet for me

856.8 --> 860.399
yeah it sounds weird maybe i should

858.56 --> 871.8389999999999
dilute it down with water it'd probably

860.399 --> 871.839
be a little bit fresher

896.399 --> 903.839
yes polar rocket storage facility

900.8 --> 906.88
okey dokey well

903.839 --> 908.72
it was explained by i don't know who was

906.88 --> 912.32
it

908.72 --> 914.399
yeah some of the experts yeah

912.32 --> 917.12
the experts whatever you think that's

914.399 --> 919.199
worth already enforce explain that that

917.12 --> 921.68
the way that explosion happened it had

919.199 --> 923.76
to be basically

921.68 --> 924.959
all placed perfectly because it could

923.76 --> 926.8
not have

924.959 --> 929.5189999999999
like an explosion like that according to

926.8 --> 932.24
them could not have resulted from

929.519 --> 934.8
uh achieving that an accidental chain

932.24 --> 940.8
detonation

934.8 --> 943.4399999999999
so yeah i didn't think of that before

940.8 --> 944.56
that they suggested it was specifically

943.44 --> 949.12
rigged

944.56 --> 952.56
to explode like that or

949.12 --> 954.399
it was a car with yeah that basically

952.56 --> 956.88
placed right next to the building and

954.399 --> 960.0
that that was the thing that

956.88 --> 965.4399999999999
gave that big explosion

960.0 --> 965.44
i don't know man i don't know

966.079 --> 983.8389999999999
it's too hot for me to figure it out

969.279 --> 983.8389999999999
right now

990.58 --> 993.9290000000001

1008.839 --> 1011.839
hmm

1022.88 --> 1039.839
hey b-ball for life it's been a long

1026.319 --> 1039.839
time since i saw you here

1045.369 --> 1048.579
[Music]

1052.48 --> 1067.84
yes it is still flat

1078.84 --> 1084.8799999999999
um

1081.12 --> 1087.76
well yeah man

1084.88 --> 1089.5200000000002
it's amazing that if i got this foot

1087.76 --> 1091.28
bath here down there

1089.52 --> 1093.039
and even though it's there for a while

1091.28 --> 1096.8799999999999
now it's still

1093.039 --> 1099.12
surprisingly cold when you put your feet

1096.88 --> 1099.1200000000001
in it

1103.919 --> 1109.8400000000001
that doesn't help

1133.25 --> 1137.84
[Music]

1134.84 --> 1137.84
ah

1151.84 --> 1157.09
yep bandsaw bandit that's right

1155.84 --> 1159.1999999999998
black swan

1157.09 --> 1161.1999999999998
[Music]

1159.2 --> 1162.32
you don't have a geometric horizon

1161.2 --> 1165.76
anymore

1162.32 --> 1169.12
that you can see in order to establish

1165.76 --> 1171.44
a geometry of the earth which would be

1169.12 --> 1173.28
required in order to establish that

1171.44 --> 1175.2
there even is a thing such as

1173.28 --> 1176.32
terrestrial refraction in the first

1175.2 --> 1180.24
place

1176.32 --> 1181.12
in order for you to not see the horizon

1180.24 --> 1184.72
in the place

1181.12 --> 1188.559
it supposedly actually has to be

1184.72 --> 1188.559
so yeah you're stuck

1190.32 --> 1195.9189999999999
the geometric horizon has been caught in

1193.039 --> 1195.919
a paradox

1199.919 --> 1204.4
and that's that's what uh ed and nathan

1202.72 --> 1206.32
have been going back and forth while

1204.4 --> 1208.48
that's constantly asserting it's a straw

1206.32 --> 1211.36
man because

1208.48 --> 1212.559
he didn't account for refraction yeah

1211.36 --> 1215.28
that's because

1212.559 --> 1215.84
there was no such thing yet you can't

1215.28 --> 1218.48
even

1215.84 --> 1219.36
conceive of refraction to be there

1218.48 --> 1223.44
unless you

1219.36 --> 1227.039
first establish a geometry

1223.44 --> 1234.24
and he didn't do that officially

1227.039 --> 1237.6
so yeah he didn't establish geometry

1234.24 --> 1239.41
it's as simple as that i'm talking about

1237.6 --> 1242.599
elbaroni

1239.41 --> 1242.5990000000002

1245.2 --> 1248.4
no sean tarnell i'm not gonna get a

shirt on it's too

1248.4 --> 1251.52
freaking hot for that

1252.32 --> 1263.84
and i don't think the ladies mind

1273.12 --> 1278.2399999999998
what happens when you have a picture of

1274.96 --> 1281.3600000000001
a clear horizon with no inferior mirage

1278.24 --> 1285.6
well then you have a clear picture of

1281.36 --> 1285.6
the horizon with no inferior mirage

1288.84 --> 1291.84
so

1330.84 --> 1333.84
foreign

1344.84 --> 1347.84

1372.84 --> 1375.84
uh

1397.919 --> 1401.679
sorry guys doing a bit of a weird

1400.72 --> 1405.28
unexpected

1401.679 --> 1408.799
nausea wave it's like sweet bro

1405.28 --> 1408.799
breaking out weird

1409.28 --> 1414.799
hope that the food bath would help but

1411.679 --> 1420.3200000000002
apparently it doesn't really help

1414.799 --> 1422.08
against that seem to trigger it

1420.32 --> 1424.1589999999999
it's like my head is like this is all

1422.08 --> 1425.039
very nice that you put your feet in

1424.159 --> 1426.88
there

1425.039 --> 1431.84
but it's your freaking head that needs

1426.88 --> 1431.8400000000001
to cool off not your feet

1447.919 --> 1461.279
i'm sure don't sell for no

1458.72 --> 1462.48
yeah i thought of putting it like a wet

1461.279 --> 1465.44
tile on my head

1462.48 --> 1467.1200000000001
maybe i don't know man it's such a

1465.44 --> 1473.8400000000001
hassle at this moment

1467.12 --> 1473.84
i'm doing better by the way

1474.72 --> 1478.72
yeah tiny wombo i already did take a

1477.52 --> 1482.24
cold shower not

1478.72 --> 1483.919
not even an hour ago i did

1482.24 --> 1487.84
what should i just be taking a cool

1483.919 --> 1487.8400000000001
shower all day long

1505.039 --> 1513.2
or wet my hair and leave it down no no

1508.24 --> 1516.24
no sorry that's a terrible idea

1513.2 --> 1519.679
it's gonna get all yeah

1516.24 --> 1519.679
drippy and yeah

1525.36 --> 1530.32
but i am seriously thinking of taking a

1527.679 --> 1543.8400000000001
dive into the river

1530.32 --> 1543.84
at this point

1554.96 --> 1559.279
yeah well for life that's called

1556.64 --> 1559.279
perspective

1561.6 --> 1565.84
you know perspective the thing that

1563.6 --> 1567.9189999999999
makes things physical objects smaller

1565.84 --> 1571.1999999999998
into the distance

1567.919 --> 1575.8400000000001
for the observer

1571.2 --> 1575.8400000000001
you know it had been replaced with

1576.0 --> 1585.84
uh with the assumption of geometrical

1579.84 --> 1585.84
earth curve and all that but it's not

1605.12 --> 1609.12
yeah there seems to be a quite a score

1608.08 --> 1610.8799999999999
of trolls

1609.12 --> 1613.76
here recently i don't know where they're

1610.88 --> 1616.0
from

1613.76 --> 1616.0
but

1617.36 --> 1622.3999999999999
they don't seem to be suffering under

1619.52 --> 1622.4
the heat as much

1622.88 --> 1627.8400000000001
they must have air conditioning

1635.279 --> 1642.96
okay yeah it's called concealment

1640.0 --> 1643.679
there's a concealment rate of all things

1642.96 --> 1648.32
when you look

1643.679 --> 1651.919
past the flat surface ball for life

1648.32 --> 1655.039
so yeah even a very big object could

1651.919 --> 1657.039
completely be concealed

1655.039 --> 1659.36
within the horizon if it is distant

1657.039 --> 1659.36
enough

1659.44 --> 1666.24
and yeah the miraging conditions are

1662.799 --> 1666.72
strongest so plenty of heat plenty of

1666.24 --> 1669.6
moist

1666.72 --> 1671.039
that'll do it and it will conceal very

1669.6 --> 1674.0
big objects

1671.039 --> 1683.84
over distance or even sometimes the

1674.0 --> 1683.84
biggest part of them

1694.84 --> 1697.84
oh

1703.2 --> 1708.799
but there is no mirage no it's not a

1706.48 --> 1711.84
mirage

1708.799 --> 1712.72
concealment effect is not the mirage

1711.84 --> 1715.6789999999999
mirages

1712.72 --> 1717.919
are when the actual visuals are visually

1715.679 --> 1721.1200000000001
displaced

1717.919 --> 1722.64
now any consummate about it is not the

1721.12 --> 1725.84
mirage no it's

1722.64 --> 1727.8400000000001
the things that are visible

1725.84 --> 1728.9599999999998
if they are displaced and that could be

1727.84 --> 1739.84
considered as

1728.96 --> 1739.8400000000001
miraged some way

1750.84 --> 1753.84
ugh

1764.84 --> 1767.84
hmm

1778.84 --> 1783.6
hmm

1780.399 --> 1786.6399999999999
okay i don't know what happened in the

1783.6 --> 1790.799
last two minutes suddenly

1786.64 --> 1790.7990000000002
my focus changed

1792.799 --> 1796.48
maybe it's because the flat earth debate

1794.399 --> 1809.84
pre-show is starting up

1796.48 --> 1809.84
and i'm resonating

1820.84 --> 1825.4399999999998
don't

1823.52 --> 1828.1589999999999
i don't need to know you don't like it

1825.44 --> 1828.159
amanda young

1829.2 --> 1832.24
i'm still gonna go there every single

1831.12 --> 1835.36
day

1832.24 --> 1851.84
when when there's a show

1835.36 --> 1851.84
and that's not gonna stop

1864.72 --> 1871.039
all right yeah nicholas riddle

1867.76 --> 1872.32
i don't know just saying about star

1871.039 --> 1876.84
rotations but

1872.32 --> 1878.6399999999999
yeah it's all it's all holographic

1876.84 --> 1883.4399999999998
lights

1878.64 --> 1886.7990000000002
it bears no geometrical

1883.44 --> 1886.799
relation to the earth

1887.44 --> 1893.6000000000001
there's no geometry that can

1890.559 --> 1896.1589999999999
effectively be derived from it that is

1893.6 --> 1897.76
true that is not a reification in some

1896.159 --> 1907.8400000000001
way

1897.76 --> 1907.84
that is not based on presuppositions

1925.919 --> 1929.1200000000001
why do i go there i go there for

1928.399 --> 1931.6
training

1929.12 --> 1933.76
because i like it because it's one of

1931.6 --> 1936.8799999999999
the few places i can actually

1933.76 --> 1938.0
converse with people that are truly

1936.88 --> 1943.0390000000002
intellectual

1938.0 --> 1946.48
in the same region that i can build with

1943.039 --> 1949.519
and i just really really

1946.48 --> 1953.039
like stupid religious doubling down

1949.519 --> 1956.799
retards to be mangled

1953.039 --> 1959.76
because i'm literally laughing out loud

1956.799 --> 1963.84
most of the times especially when nathan

1959.76 --> 1963.84
gets extra sadistic yes i do

1967.279 --> 1990.4
one of the few and indulgences of mine

1976.559 --> 1993.569
so yeah there's a lot for me there

1990.4 --> 1993.5690000000002
[Music]

1999.61 --> 2004.109
[Music]

2019.679 --> 2033.8400000000001
hmm all right nicholas riddle that's a

2022.72 --> 2033.84
good vantage point at least

2044.84 --> 2047.84
huh

2049.52 --> 2054.159
oh man the temperature is like really

2051.919 --> 2056.72
clearing up

2054.159 --> 2057.76
this place is like feeling like an oven

2056.72 --> 2060.1589999999997
that has just

2057.76 --> 2061.679
turned off like 15 minutes ago and it's

2060.159 --> 2064.96
slowly

2061.679 --> 2068.159
getting better like really it's it's now

2064.96 --> 2070.159
it's just different very very different

2068.159 --> 2071.599
from what it was 20 minutes ago right

2070.159 --> 2074.48
here

2071.599 --> 2076.2400000000002
i don't know if visually it is changes

2074.48 --> 2078.0
somewhat that it seems less light

2076.24 --> 2082.7999999999997
intensive or something but it's just

2078.0 --> 2082.8
a lot better now here a lot

2093.2 --> 2100.56
nicholas riddle uh sadistic kiwi

2096.8 --> 2104.2400000000002
nah i don't know when kiwi gets

2100.56 --> 2106.0789999999997
like really angry and [ __ ]

2104.24 --> 2109.359
that doesn't really do it for me i find

2106.079 --> 2109.3590000000004
it a little too disruptive

2109.839 --> 2116.64
and i haven't really seen him sadistic

2113.44 --> 2118.2400000000002
like that he doesn't he explodes before

2116.64 --> 2121.44
he can even get to that

2118.24 --> 2125.359
with ballers you know nathan is really

2121.44 --> 2125.359
he can do that because he does

2125.92 --> 2130.96
yeah keep control over himself during

2128.8 --> 2131.52
those situations kiwi doesn't really do

2130.96 --> 2134.8
that

2131.52 --> 2136.56
he just gets really foaming out the

2134.8 --> 2139.28
mouth pissed off

2136.56 --> 2139.2799999999997
at the atomo

2140.4 --> 2145.6800000000003
and loud starts yelling clown and all

2144.0 --> 2149.28
that and probably for good reason

2145.68 --> 2151.68
although sometimes he kind of mistakes

2149.28 --> 2152.7200000000003
yeah he picks up a word he thought he

2151.68 --> 2154.96
heard and then

2152.72 --> 2156.8799999999997
turned out not to be that and yeah that

2154.96 --> 2160.32
happens

2156.88 --> 2161.76
but yeah nathan does it he has a much

2160.32 --> 2164.88
better

2161.76 --> 2167.28
more focused routine

2164.88 --> 2167.28
with it

2168.72 --> 2174.56
uh hey oj is it hot there too yeah it's

2172.0 --> 2177.28
totally cooking man it's 33 degrees here

2174.56 --> 2177.2799999999997
in utrecht

2178.56 --> 2183.04
and i thought it was hot yesterday with

2180.48 --> 2183.04
28.

2184.839 --> 2187.839
sheesh

2199.04 --> 2203.7599999999998
most globes believe i think you mean

2202.48 --> 2205.599
glowers

2203.76 --> 2208.48
they believe that nathan is not genuine

2205.599 --> 2210.88
but they do that with everyone

2208.48 --> 2212.64
if you make sense if you're direct if

2210.88 --> 2216.1600000000003
you don't back down

2212.64 --> 2218.64
if you are persistent then

2216.16 --> 2219.68
you must not be genuine you must not

2218.64 --> 2221.44
really believe

2219.68 --> 2222.8799999999997
everything you're saying you put in all

2221.44 --> 2224.88
that energy

2222.88 --> 2226.2400000000002
you're standing by of course that makes

2224.88 --> 2229.599
so much sense because

2226.24 --> 2230.7999999999997
it's too painful to realize that it's

2229.599 --> 2233.119
not

2230.8 --> 2234.0
that's the only reason why the ballers

2233.119 --> 2235.839
believe that

2234.0 --> 2238.079
because they're just doubling down

2235.839 --> 2240.24
idiots

2238.079 --> 2242.48
they can't handle the freaking truth so

2240.24 --> 2244.64
they're gonna blurt out their [ __ ]

2242.48 --> 2244.88
reversed world interpretation right over

2244.64 --> 2246.4
it

2244.88 --> 2249.2000000000003
because it makes them feel a little bit

2246.4 --> 2249.2000000000003
more comfortable

2264.24 --> 2268.3999999999996
yes it does dank yes it does it really

2266.96 --> 2271.44
does

2268.4 --> 2275.119
i bet i i i

2271.44 --> 2278.0
i bet you i'll bet you not for money

2275.119 --> 2279.44
unless i don't have to pay it but i'll

2278.0 --> 2282.88
bet you

2279.44 --> 2284.7200000000003
that there have been ballers not saying

2282.88 --> 2285.599
the people that are on the panel and all

2284.72 --> 2288.24
that

2285.599 --> 2289.04
but i i swear it there has to be there

2288.24 --> 2291.4399999999996
have to be

2289.04 --> 2292.72
ballers out there that have watched the

2291.44 --> 2296.7200000000003
flat earth debate

2292.72 --> 2299.68
and probably literally [ __ ] their pants

2296.72 --> 2300.56
i'm not saying like full yeah fall turd

2299.68 --> 2303.68
and all but just

2300.56 --> 2305.92
like from the shock of things and

2303.68 --> 2307.04
i i think there's probably literally

2305.92 --> 2309.839
been ballers that have

2307.04 --> 2312.8
actually [ __ ] their pants during the

2309.839 --> 2316.32
flat earth debates listening to it

2312.8 --> 2317.52
i really think so not saying that that's

2316.32 --> 2321.28
something that occurs

2317.52 --> 2323.599
regularly but it has happened i know it

2321.28 --> 2323.599
has

2323.68 --> 2326.96
and i don't think that those people that

2325.599 --> 2330.0
have will

2326.96 --> 2331.04
share about it or will get on the panel

2330.0 --> 2333.04
anytime soon

2331.04 --> 2334.64
just saying but i'm pretty sure that

2333.04 --> 2336.4
ballers have actually

2334.64 --> 2338.96
shed their pants listening to the

2336.4 --> 2341.839
flatter debates physically literal

2338.96 --> 2341.839
yes

2345.119 --> 2350.2400000000002
and partially unhealthy diet pro also

2347.76 --> 2352.8390000000004
has something to do with it probably

2350.24 --> 2355.839
makes it a little easier for that to

2352.839 --> 2355.839
happen

2365.92 --> 2372.96
thank you for the 1999

2369.359 --> 2375.7599999999998
dollar super chat third good servant

2372.96 --> 2375.76
thank you very much

2380.0 --> 2383.52
yeah ball for life i know that that's

2382.4 --> 2387.359
what most of you

2383.52 --> 2391.2
do in yeah in in self-defense

2387.359 --> 2392.56
it's called projection in self-defense

2391.2 --> 2394.72
you point and laugh

2392.56 --> 2396.4
because that's exactly what we're doing

2394.72 --> 2396.7999999999997
and you can't handle it so you have to

2396.4 --> 2399.6800000000003
flip

2396.8 --> 2401.119
the entire world inside out and then you

2399.68 --> 2404.24
become the person

2401.119 --> 2405.52
pointing and laughing at us well in

2404.24 --> 2408.0789999999997
reality

2405.52 --> 2409.28
it is the opposite and everybody that

2408.079 --> 2412.88
has a lick of sense

2409.28 --> 2413.28
knows it knows that we are laughing at

2412.88 --> 2415.119
you

2413.28 --> 2418.48
and that you are just projecting and

2415.119 --> 2421.92
giggling like a bunch of idiots

2418.48 --> 2424.64
everybody knows only people

2421.92 --> 2426.7200000000003
that don't care about the truth only

2424.64 --> 2428.24
care about the ball to be reified into

2426.72 --> 2431.839
reality

2428.24 --> 2435.5989999999997
care about that

2431.839 --> 2437.92
only those will really go along with

2435.599 --> 2440.0
that peer pressure mechanism just going

2437.92 --> 2442.88
along with the horde

2440.0 --> 2444.48
turning the world inside out oh by the

2442.88 --> 2447.119
way thank you

2444.48 --> 2449.52
who's that eagle played an anchor from

2447.119 --> 2451.359
for becoming a member he's a ranger now

2449.52 --> 2455.839
thank you very much

2451.359 --> 2457.52
welcome to the club cool

2455.839 --> 2459.52
yeah you might be able to check out some

2457.52 --> 2461.7599999999998
of my uh

2459.52 --> 2462.64
members only videos for it's from a

2461.76 --> 2465.76
while ago

2462.64 --> 2466.0
like interview or interview just some

2465.76 --> 2469.3590000000004
back

2466.0 --> 2472.88
panel discord recordings

2469.359 --> 2475.44
with chai key and add and zanic

2472.88 --> 2476.88
on several several occasions but i

2475.44 --> 2480.16
haven't made any new

2476.88 --> 2481.839
recordings anytime recently i showed

2480.16 --> 2484.8799999999997
really as i've been saying for many

2481.839 --> 2495.839
times but it's just not coming to it

2484.88 --> 2495.839
it's too hot i think

2516.319 --> 2525.2
hmm oh well

2519.44 --> 2525.2000000000003
yeah almost forgot did anybody see

2525.359 --> 2531.68
i i posted a video in master b

2529.44 --> 2531.68
they

2532.56 --> 2540.0
as some of people in chat has have

2536.48 --> 2543.28
have named it the grain silo

2540.0 --> 2547.119
launch of 2020.

2543.28 --> 2550.8
apparently spacex did a well

2547.119 --> 2551.92
it actually looked potentially not faked

2550.8 --> 2556.48
even

2551.92 --> 2559.04
a thing that launched upwards and then

2556.48 --> 2560.72
basically stopped it kept straight and

2559.04 --> 2562.88
then landed back down

2560.72 --> 2564.0789999999997
i think that sort of thing has been seen

2562.88 --> 2566.319
before

2564.079 --> 2568.0
but it was probably fake i think that

2566.319 --> 2570.4
this thing may actually be

2568.0 --> 2572.8
real it but it just looks absolutely

2570.4 --> 2572.8
weird

2572.96 --> 2577.04
i think i'll share it it was really

2576.0 --> 2580.88
weird looking

2577.04 --> 2580.88
it does look like a grain silo

2581.52 --> 2585.04
so it's just a minute video

2585.68 --> 2593.839
i think i can share that i don't think

2588.079 --> 2593.8390000000004
elon musk will mind if i share that

2597.119 --> 2607.839
right yeah get ready for this

2600.72 --> 2607.839
two one

2608.89 --> 2612.0299999999997
[Music]

2632.839 --> 2638.969
raptor

2633.97 --> 2638.9689999999996
[Music]

2645.51 --> 2650.0
[Music]

2647.04 --> 2652.24
only now it could be that they had an

2650.0 --> 2654.56
original complete footage

2652.24 --> 2658.0
but they simply couldn't get the thing

2654.56 --> 2660.7999999999997
to land properly without crashing

2658.0 --> 2663.2
so i think that maybe the final part

2660.8 --> 2664.96
might have been added on

2663.2 --> 2666.7999999999997
because they couldn't get the thing to

2664.96 --> 2671.119
just land without crashing

2666.8 --> 2675.599
which should be absurdly difficult

2671.119 --> 2677.359
right anyway let's see just look again

2675.599 --> 2678.8
three oh by the way thank you amanda

2677.359 --> 2691.839
young for the five dollar super chat

2678.8 --> 2691.8390000000004
donation and paypal

2698.0 --> 2709.21
i think it looks fascinating

2704.319 --> 2713.09
it looks like a giant director coffee

2709.21 --> 2713.09
[Music]

2716.839 --> 2719.839
storage

2721.19 --> 2724.9
[Music]

2728.32 --> 2734.2400000000002
[Music]

2731.599 --> 2734.2400000000002
full duration

2740.96 --> 2747.839
yep that's what it was

2752.88 --> 2756.2400000000002
waste of time and money maybe yeah

2755.28 --> 2761.8390000000004
probably

2756.24 --> 2761.839
i still thought it was pretty fun yeah

2764.079 --> 2768.2400000000002
i don't know there's just also in the

2766.24 --> 2769.04
comment section there's not like flat

2768.24 --> 2772.839
earth

2769.04 --> 2775.68
comments in there but people are making

2772.839 --> 2779.04
jokes so

2775.68 --> 2781.2799999999997
like this guy here 1980 we will have

2779.04 --> 2784.56
flying cars in 2020

2781.28 --> 2789.8390000000004
2020 flying grain silo

2784.56 --> 2789.839
come on that's funny

2804.319 --> 2810.64
i could have slapped coca-cola label on

2807.68 --> 2810.64
it oh my god

2814.839 --> 2817.839
worst

2827.92 --> 2834.079
anyway yeah yeah i saw it and i thought

2831.44 --> 2834.96
hey that's actually kind of interesting

2834.079 --> 2838.48
did they

2834.96 --> 2841.52
actually try to really

2838.48 --> 2844.4
make that thing work the way it's

2841.52 --> 2846.96
supposed to work this time

2844.4 --> 2848.7200000000003
instead of just faking this reversed

2846.96 --> 2851.599
rocket launch thing that they did

2848.72 --> 2854.0789999999997
with the other one which was absolutely

2851.599 --> 2856.88
ridiculous

2854.079 --> 2857.44
are they actually making something that

2856.88 --> 2862.4
can

2857.44 --> 2862.4
rocket propel launch and then land like

2870.839 --> 2876.4
that

2872.88 --> 2879.359
no i don't think so george sanford

2876.4 --> 2879.92
you know with the previous one that was

2879.359 --> 2883.5989999999997
already

2879.92 --> 2886.0
well treated by uh yeah

2883.599 --> 2886.88
david wise and jaren and all that dealt

2886.0 --> 2888.88
with that

2886.88 --> 2891.44
the spacex launched where it was like oh

2888.88 --> 2894.48
yeah look the rocket's gonna land

2891.44 --> 2895.04
vertically down and but that thing

2894.48 --> 2898.48
looked

2895.04 --> 2901.839
so unbelievably fake that was

2898.48 --> 2902.8
really fake that had to be fake it was

2901.839 --> 2906.0
fake

2902.8 --> 2909.28
but this thing i don't know i don't know

2906.0 --> 2909.28
if this one was fake

2910.88 --> 2918.0
there might be some things like edited

2915.52 --> 2920.4
but it really did look like that one

2918.0 --> 2922.0
singular shot was just that one singular

2920.4 --> 2925.44
shot they didn't

2922.0 --> 2929.839
cgi anything that really looked like

2925.44 --> 2929.839
what it was

2933.359 --> 2938.16
now why would you need that

2936.4 --> 2939.839
that's another matter you know when you

2938.16 --> 2941.52
can just

2939.839 --> 2943.68
pretty much do the same thing with a

2941.52 --> 2957.839
helicopter

2943.68 --> 2957.839
you know it's a lot cheaper

2958.88 --> 2965.2000000000003
it's such an amazing piece of

2960.88 --> 2965.2000000000003
engineering that's [ __ ] sept happy

2966.16 --> 2973.68
it's not that amazing it's very wasteful

2970.48 --> 2974.319
and yeah of course we're not gonna pump

2973.68 --> 2977.52
out

2974.319 --> 2980.64
billion dollar wasteful

2977.52 --> 2984.88
projects supposedly to yeah oh

2980.64 --> 2987.52
to expand upon humanity because it's

2984.88 --> 2989.599
it's a waste of money nobody would ever

2987.52 --> 2993.2
invest that with their own money than

2989.599 --> 2993.2000000000003
if they would they're out of their minds

2993.68 --> 3001.1189999999997
but yeah we do plenty

2997.28 --> 3001.119
we're figuring out what's real

3001.92 --> 3013.839
building the puzzle

3016.559 --> 3020.96
well sure zap tappy i'd love to do that

3019.2 --> 3024.0
as well can you arrange

3020.96 --> 3026.319
me to get like a couple of billion

3024.0 --> 3027.359
dollars for that in an engineering team

3026.319 --> 3029.68
and

3027.359 --> 3030.88
yeah i can do that too i'm pretty damn

3029.68 --> 3034.16
sure that i could

3030.88 --> 3034.8
yes i can i can do that i can build that

3034.16 --> 3037.2799999999997
thing

3034.8 --> 3039.6800000000003
with the help of engineers because i'm a

3037.28 --> 3042.559
visionary and a designer

3039.68 --> 3043.68
by heart i can do that i can do it every

3042.559 --> 3047.119
step of the way

3043.68 --> 3049.5989999999997
i can improve upon it i bet i could

3047.119 --> 3051.76
but i'm not going to because the way

3049.599 --> 3054.6400000000003
that whole thing is set up

3051.76 --> 3056.3190000000004
is not to be absolutely legitimate

3054.64 --> 3060.64
technology

3056.319 --> 3063.839
it's there it's like this halfway point

3060.64 --> 3064.24
where it's done to impress people and to

3063.839 --> 3067.2
fool

3064.24 --> 3068.319
people and to maybe figure out a couple

3067.2 --> 3071.52
of technology

3068.319 --> 3074.88
technological details so

3071.52 --> 3075.44
nothing is exactly as they as it seems

3074.88 --> 3079.359
it is or

3075.44 --> 3079.359
they say it is that's not how it

3080.839 --> 3084.319
functions

3082.16 --> 3086.0
yeah that's really nice you go arrange

3084.319 --> 3088.079
that for me zap tappy

3086.0 --> 3089.44
you go build that billion dollar fund

3088.079 --> 3092.1600000000003
for me

3089.44 --> 3093.839
and stop bothering me about it you do it

3092.16 --> 3097.359
you get the money

3093.839 --> 3099.839
you hire me i'll do it okay sept happy

3097.359 --> 3100.7999999999997
in the meantime shut the [ __ ] up about

3099.839 --> 3104.16
it

3100.8 --> 3106.079
okay you're not gonna do it

3104.16 --> 3110.0
you can get that money together for

3106.079 --> 3113.04
yourself you couldn't do it

3110.0 --> 3116.16
yeah so stop whining about that [ __ ]

3113.04 --> 3118.96
yeah money is a [ __ ] excuse you [ __ ]

3116.16 --> 3125.839
get the [ __ ] out it is an excuse now

3118.96 --> 3125.839
shut the [ __ ] up

3136.839 --> 3139.839
uh

3147.599 --> 3155.839
yeah rocket scientist it's all about

3151.119 --> 3155.839
fire heat thrust chemistry

3156.2 --> 3159.2
aerodynamics

3159.21 --> 3164.8
[Music]

3161.599 --> 3165.52
this engineering that stuff yeah i don't

3164.8 --> 3168.6400000000003
have to be

3165.52 --> 3172.88
a engineer degreed researched

3168.64 --> 3176.5589999999997
person i'm a designer i'm a visionary

3172.88 --> 3181.119
i figure out what's real and i utilize

3176.559 --> 3183.8390000000004
other people's knowledge

3181.119 --> 3184.559
to get something done that's what i do

3183.839 --> 3188.88
that's what

3184.559 --> 3192.4
i do okay i'm

3188.88 --> 3194.0
not an optician i'm not a physics person

3192.4 --> 3197.119
that has specialized and

3194.0 --> 3199.839
graduated in optics but guess what

3197.119 --> 3200.48
i figured it out anyway how did i do

3199.839 --> 3204.319
that

3200.48 --> 3207.52
by using other people's knowledge

3204.319 --> 3223.839
yeah that's what i can do i can

3207.52 --> 3223.839
yeah i can yes

3231.839 --> 3237.359
isn't that what you isn't that what

3235.359 --> 3239.04
what english the english language you

3237.359 --> 3241.839
know isn't that what

3239.04 --> 3244.16
elon musk does yes yes that's exactly

3241.839 --> 3247.2799999999997
what elon musk does

3244.16 --> 3249.68
and as i said i could definitely fulfill

3247.28 --> 3252.48
that role

3249.68 --> 3253.44
up to a certain point because yeah he is

3252.48 --> 3256.96
also

3253.44 --> 3260.16
a corporate representative face

3256.96 --> 3263.359
face mask wearing yeah

3260.16 --> 3265.04
corporate [ __ ] like that so not i'm not

3263.359 --> 3268.7999999999997
really willing to go that far

3265.04 --> 3272.16
for it if that is what it actually takes

3268.8 --> 3275.44
then no then humanity or

3272.16 --> 3278.48
corporatism can go [ __ ] itself can all

3275.44 --> 3279.839
burn down to the ground every last

3278.48 --> 3283.599
company every

3279.839 --> 3283.92
last piece of money investment can all

3283.599 --> 3286.079
go

3283.92 --> 3287.2000000000003
[ __ ] themselves if it means that i have

3286.079 --> 3290.799
to go along with

3287.2 --> 3291.4399999999996
absolute [ __ ] lies to play along

3290.799 --> 3294.16
with that it's

3291.44 --> 3295.68
never gonna happen though you know

3294.16 --> 3298.0
that's

3295.68 --> 3299.44
that's why i'm just our win here on

3298.0 --> 3303.119
youtube

3299.44 --> 3304.64
but yeah you shove a whole lot of money

3303.119 --> 3307.839
towards me and i can

3304.64 --> 3310.96
definitely get real things designed and

3307.839 --> 3313.7599999999998
built and functioning and tested and

3310.96 --> 3313.76
perfected

3316.079 --> 3324.1600000000003
i could don't know if i could

3320.96 --> 3326.4
ever get into the degree of like

3324.16 --> 3327.359
how the russians seem to build that sort

3326.4 --> 3329.76
of thing because they're

3327.359 --> 3331.359
very good at it from what i've gathered

3329.76 --> 3334.88
so far

3331.359 --> 3337.7599999999998
so yeah i'm not

3334.88 --> 3337.76
i'm good enough

3340.4 --> 3345.839
but yeah this is so pointless

3343.599 --> 3347.3590000000004
because nobody's gonna get me a billion

3345.839 --> 3349.92
and nobody's gonna put me

3347.359 --> 3351.7599999999998
at the front head of some corporation

3349.92 --> 3353.76
that's going to receive billions through

3351.76 --> 3355.44
tax dollars

3353.76 --> 3363.8390000000004
and let me do my thing that's just not

3355.44 --> 3363.839
going to happen

3368.799 --> 3373.7599999999998
oh my god we got another one that went

3372.0 --> 3376.88
to space camp people

3373.76 --> 3379.119
nicholas riddle went to space camp oh

3376.88 --> 3380.6400000000003
by the way i completely forgot about the

3379.119 --> 3383.839
paypal

3380.64 --> 3391.839
let me check that hashtag me fandid

3383.839 --> 3391.839
amanda young

3391.92 --> 3400.2400000000002
oh thank you very much

3396.16 --> 3405.839
awesome that's definitely going to be

3400.24 --> 3405.839
very helpful

3412.16 --> 3416.0789999999997
all right so i'm gonna round out the

3416.839 --> 3420.72
show

3418.16 --> 3422.64
well see i got a show after all and it

3420.72 --> 3424.0789999999997
started out a bit overheated and

3422.64 --> 3426.4
nauseated and all that but

3424.079 --> 3428.079
still got a show at least the second

3426.4 --> 3431.6800000000003
half

3428.079 --> 3434.2400000000002
and it is slightly less hot here

3431.68 --> 3435.5989999999997
so i'm still kind of sweating it seems

3434.24 --> 3438.24
but

3435.599 --> 3440.319
i don't know i feel a bit better but

3438.24 --> 3441.839
thanks everyone for coming i hope you

3440.319 --> 3442.96
liked the show even though it started a

3441.839 --> 3444.5589999999997
bit slow

3442.96 --> 3446.559
if you did then please don't forget to

3444.559 --> 3448.1600000000003
rogan's it up and if you haven't already

3446.559 --> 3449.8390000000004
subscribe to my channel and hit the bell

3689.359 --> 3692.96
well i set up for today's live show

3694.4 --> 3698.7200000000003
yeah did you catch it early did you

3696.48 --> 3700.96
catch it right when it started

3698.72 --> 3702.72
well my wife called and was like what's

3700.96 --> 3706.799
with the balloons popping

3702.72 --> 3709.7599999999998
i'm like uh it's not balloons popping

3706.799 --> 3710.72
then the circuit breaker went and i'm

3709.76 --> 3713.119
like okay

3710.72 --> 3714.72
what what's going on so i turned the

3713.119 --> 3716.079
circuit breaker back on it just popped

3714.72 --> 3717.839
and popped and popped so i was like okay

3716.079 --> 3719.52
we'll have to wait maybe it's overheated

3717.839 --> 3720.96
i figured out how many things i had on

3719.52 --> 3724.24
it wasn't a great deal of

3720.96 --> 3726.559
things number of things um

3724.24 --> 3727.359
so wait about five minutes turned every

3726.559 --> 3728.96
single thing

3727.359 --> 3730.16
in the house off and then slowly one by

3728.96 --> 3731.119
one turned it back on when we got to the

3730.16 --> 3733.2
fridge

3731.119 --> 3734.6400000000003
it turned on was going pop up pop up

3733.2 --> 3735.7599999999998
like [ __ ] turn it up turn it back off

3734.64 --> 3737.839
again quick

3735.76 --> 3739.76
so i pulled it out turn it turn it

3737.839 --> 3742.4
around and behind it one of the

3739.76 --> 3743.76
fuse boards not fuse boards one of the

3742.4 --> 3746.079
pcbs had just

3743.76 --> 3747.44
shorted was just throwing sparks

3746.079 --> 3749.52
everywhere and was

3747.44 --> 3752.64
all fire inside the box and it was all

3749.52 --> 3754.96
burnt out and charred i was like oh [ __ ]

3752.64 --> 3754.96
actually

3756.64 --> 3760.0789999999997
because it was running it's one of those

3757.92 --> 3762.48
things that he was making a horrendous

3760.079 --> 3764.7200000000003
noise but obviously it's tucked in right

3762.48 --> 3766.48
so i'm reasonably okay with the sound of

3764.72 --> 3767.2
electrical arcing i know what it sounds

3766.48 --> 3768.64
like

3767.2 --> 3770.0
but if you if you weren't familiar with

3768.64 --> 3771.92
that sound you just like well it's still

3770.0 --> 3774.24
running

3771.92 --> 3776.16
you know what i mean because it was sure

3774.24 --> 3778.8799999999997
sure

3776.16 --> 3781.1189999999997
was your fridge loaded with food i

3778.88 --> 3781.119
didn't

3781.2 --> 3785.2
was your fridge loaded with food yeah

3784.16 --> 3787.5989999999997
that's generally what

3785.2 --> 3790.0789999999997
what fridges are used for did you use

3787.599 --> 3792.96
yours for air conditioning or something

3790.079 --> 3795.039
it could be right my point is you would

3792.96 --> 3796.799
have to get a caller right

3795.039 --> 3798.88
put everything in no the freezer stuff

3796.799 --> 3800.559
we just took to my wife's friend's house

3798.88 --> 3802.48
so she's got a big chest freezer and she

3800.559 --> 3804.3190000000004
choked it all in there and then over the

3802.48 --> 3806.48
course of the last 24 hours

3804.319 --> 3808.799
we just slowly transferred stuff from

3806.48 --> 3810.88
fridge to freezer

3808.799 --> 3812.559
and now it's you know getting to the end

3810.88 --> 3813.76
of its coolness so by the end of today

3812.559 --> 3817.2000000000003
there'll be nothing cold

3813.76 --> 3819.119
at all because that happened

3817.2 --> 3820.5589999999997
to me but i wasn't so lucky it happened

3819.119 --> 3822.559
when i was away

3820.559 --> 3825.44
when we came back everything was just

3822.559 --> 3829.28
like melted in bed

3825.44 --> 3829.28
not a fire that fridge just went on

3830.799 --> 3834.48
yeah that could uh especially in the big

3833.28 --> 3839.8390000000004
freezer people have

3834.48 --> 3839.839
thousands of dollars worth of food

3840.319 --> 3846.16
so are you gonna get a new fridge today

3843.52 --> 3847.52
i don't think so it's too expensive so

3846.16 --> 3852.48
hopefully we'll get the one fixed

3847.52 --> 3854.88
that we have how much is the fridge

3852.48 --> 3857.28
um what the fridge that we have was

3854.88 --> 3859.839
about 750 pounds

3857.28 --> 3861.76
i think we got it fairly cheap it's like

3859.839 --> 3863.52
a big american thing

3861.76 --> 3867.119
yeah if we had to take it to pieces just

3863.52 --> 3868.96
to get it in through the door

3867.119 --> 3870.88
you don't have uh someone with the

3868.96 --> 3872.2400000000002
smaller ones just to get by until you

3870.88 --> 3874.96
fix it

3872.24 --> 3876.319
well no it's it is irritating on account

3874.96 --> 3877.599
of the fact that a fridge is one of

3876.319 --> 3879.52
those things that sits right in that

3877.599 --> 3881.52
horrible price bracket where it's

3879.52 --> 3883.28
not so expensive that you could consider

3881.52 --> 3885.119
it something that would last forever

3883.28 --> 3886.799
but not so cheap that it's worth

3885.119 --> 3888.319
throwing away it's in that horrible

3886.799 --> 3889.68
in-between ground a bit like an iphone

3888.319 --> 3892.24
or something similar

3889.68 --> 3892.72
it's considered by a retailer disposable

3892.24 --> 3894.4799999999996
i'm like

3892.72 --> 3895.839
uh oh no i'm not gonna throw away a

3894.48 --> 3897.599
thousand pound fridge

3895.839 --> 3901.0389999999998
just because this one circuit board gone

3897.599 --> 3901.039
wrong that seems ludicrous

3901.839 --> 3906.88
oh this is a fridge um

3907.119 --> 3912.079
pretty old i don't know it's just not

3910.4 --> 3913.599
worth throwing away i'm not like that i

3912.079 --> 3914.4
hate throwing things away that costs a

3913.599 --> 3918.6400000000003
lot of money

3914.4 --> 3922.1600000000003
just sh i i'm just saying because

3918.64 --> 3924.16
my parents and uh even uh myself

3922.16 --> 3925.92
not as long as them but man they are the

3924.16 --> 3928.96
fridge that

3925.92 --> 3930.4
was nearing 30 years

3928.96 --> 3932.799
yeah fridges are supposed to last

3930.4 --> 3935.599
forever yeah 30 years

3932.799 --> 3937.2
one one guy told me his won 35 years

3935.599 --> 3938.559
right this is probably less than five

3937.2 --> 3943.68
years old

3938.559 --> 3943.6800000000003
oh yeah yeah they they

3945.44 --> 3950.2400000000002
just everything consumable the quality

3948.48 --> 3950.72
is lower and lower and lower anyway this

3950.24 --> 3952.16
is

3950.72 --> 3954.64
recording this nonsense boring

3952.16 --> 3956.48
conversation about my broken fridge

3954.64 --> 3957.839
it will not turn into a thousand views i

3956.48 --> 3960.48
thought it was a cool conversation

3957.839 --> 3960.48
myself but

3962.0 --> 3965.76
i sleep have you seen mitchell from

3963.92 --> 3966.88
australia's latest coriolis video yes

3965.76 --> 3969.6800000000003
it's excellent

3966.88 --> 3970.1600000000003
i really like that really good and kudos

3969.68 --> 3973.0389999999998
to

3970.16 --> 3973.68
mitchell because i've got to be honest i

3973.039 --> 3975.6800000000003
i

3973.68 --> 3976.96
i'm pretty lazy unless i've actually got

3975.68 --> 3978.96
the bit between my teeth so

3976.96 --> 3980.48
with underfoot um i've just spent all

3978.96 --> 3982.2400000000002
morning doing a response

3980.48 --> 3984.0
right all morning editing a response

3982.24 --> 3987.7599999999998
together um

3984.0 --> 3990.24
whereas simon dan he just he strikes me

3987.76 --> 3991.039
so stupid it's not worth responding to

3990.24 --> 3992.799
him you know he

3991.039 --> 3994.1600000000003
obviously doesn't understand coriolis

3992.799 --> 3996.48
effect at all

3994.16 --> 3997.44
um but when someone like mitchell does

3996.48 --> 3999.44
it

3997.44 --> 4000.96
he's that little bit more cheeky chappie

3999.44 --> 4003.359
than me so he's

4000.96 --> 4004.079
i don't know i appreciate him doing it

4003.359 --> 4005.5989999999997
more than

4004.079 --> 4007.6800000000003
probably other people would appreciate

4005.599 --> 4009.28
me in a very dry way

4007.68 --> 4010.64
pulling apart his total lack of

4009.28 --> 4011.2000000000003
understanding when it comes to coriolis

4010.64 --> 4013.68
but

4011.2 --> 4014.3999999999996
pat's off to you mitchell great job and

4013.68 --> 4017.1189999999997
andy

4014.4 --> 4018.48
uh used a new point which is another one

4017.119 --> 4019.039
of those where you kind of slap your own

4018.48 --> 4020.72
face and go

4019.039 --> 4022.559
of course why didn't i ever phrase it

4020.72 --> 4026.0789999999997
like that with the stars

4022.559 --> 4026.48
genius yeah the stars stop rotating when

4026.079 --> 4030.48
you're

4026.48 --> 4032.16
in the sky not according to the iss

4030.48 --> 4034.48
yeah that debunks the whole reference

4032.16 --> 4035.839
frame circumstance that they assert to

4034.48 --> 4036.2400000000002
give them coriolis effect from the

4035.839 --> 4038.24
ground

4036.24 --> 4039.839
as per the neil degrasse tyson example

4038.24 --> 4042.9599999999996
it was an excellent

4039.839 --> 4045.599
breakdown by uh mitchell and uh

4042.96 --> 4047.52
completely we need to focus up as well

4045.599 --> 4048.96
on the contradiction between simon dan

4047.52 --> 4050.799
or no time and

4048.96 --> 4052.48
and um near the grass because neil

4050.799 --> 4052.88
degrasse says that the the the field

4052.48 --> 4054.96
goal

4052.88 --> 4056.1600000000003
kick proves that the earth rotates and

4054.96 --> 4058.2400000000002
that caused it

4056.16 --> 4059.7599999999998
and then samandan says it doesn't rotate

4058.24 --> 4061.0389999999998
so we need to dwell on that as well but

4059.76 --> 4062.88
he needs to get kudos because his

4061.039 --> 4064.4
video's really good

4062.88 --> 4065.76
yeah i couldn't agree more he did he

4064.4 --> 4067.28
just did a very good job i mean there

4065.76 --> 4067.92
always are mitchell always does a good

4067.28 --> 4069.52
job

4067.92 --> 4071.359
um but in that particular instance i

4069.52 --> 4072.319
just thought really well done i'm going

4071.359 --> 4077.839
to play it

4072.319 --> 4077.839
does anybody object no no not at all

4079.44 --> 4083.119
and the other thing as well is i

4081.44 --> 4084.799
contacted fight the flat earth

4083.119 --> 4086.1600000000003
on purpose just to see whether or not

4084.799 --> 4088.079
which side he fell on

4086.16 --> 4089.68
i wanted to know did he agree with neil

4088.079 --> 4091.3590000000004
degrasse tyson that the earth does turn

4089.68 --> 4093.52
underneath the ball as he kicks it

4091.359 --> 4095.359
or does he agree with um what's his face

4093.52 --> 4095.92
simon dan when he says that the earth

4095.359 --> 4097.759
does not

4095.92 --> 4099.52
rotate underneath the uh the thing

4097.759 --> 4100.48
that's in the non-rotating frame of

4099.52 --> 4102.4800000000005
reference

4100.48 --> 4104.239
and basically i realized it was a

4102.48 --> 4105.919999999999
massive mistake because all he did was

4104.239 --> 4107.04
he started laughing about how stupid i

4105.92 --> 4108.319
was and all that

4107.04 --> 4109.2789999999995
and i'm like i shouldn't have asked you

4108.319 --> 4111.359
we should have asked somebody like

4109.279 --> 4114.400000000001
rumpus that will actually have a go with

4111.359 --> 4115.92
addressing the question but um yeah so

4114.4 --> 4117.12
fight the flat earth i had to just block

4115.92 --> 4119.839
him in the end because i realized that

4117.12 --> 4119.839
he's a waste of time

4120.239 --> 4123.44
right i'm going to play this video up

4123.679 --> 4129.839
star rotations and sunsets

4127.279 --> 4130.799000000001
debunk the globe yes mitchell from

4129.839 --> 4133.679
australia

4130.799 --> 4134.319
is a youtuber flat earther that thinks

4133.679 --> 4137.1990000000005
that

4134.319 --> 4137.839000000001
us globals are going to regret ever

4137.199 --> 4140.96
saying

4137.839 --> 4142.0
that star rotation and sunsets prove the

4140.96 --> 4144.4
earth's spin

4142.0 --> 4147.839
let's take a close look at his reasoning

4144.4 --> 4147.839
shall we

4148.0 --> 4153.199
[Music]

4151.04 --> 4154.319
i'm mitchell from australia and being

4153.199 --> 4157.3589999999995
from australia

4154.319 --> 4159.759
i get called the dumbest of the dumb

4157.359 --> 4161.04
flat earthers this is because the

4159.759 --> 4164.48
globals

4161.04 --> 4165.759
say that southern star rotation debunks

4164.48 --> 4167.599999999999
the flat earth

4165.759 --> 4169.44
but this argument is going to be your

4167.6 --> 4171.4400000000005
downfall globe believers because

4169.44 --> 4173.12
on your model stars aren't actually

4171.44 --> 4175.599999999999
rotating are they

4173.12 --> 4177.12
it's the earth rotating underneath the

4175.6 --> 4179.92
stars

4177.12 --> 4181.599999999999
and you asserting that you're on that

4179.92 --> 4184.64
rotating earth

4181.6 --> 4188.08
looking up at the stars making the stars

4184.64 --> 4191.12
appear to be rotating not actually

4188.08 --> 4191.92
rotating yep that's the general gist of

4191.12 --> 4195.04
it

4191.92 --> 4198.0
just like this demonstration of a drone

4195.04 --> 4199.679
leaving the rotating reference frame of

4198.0 --> 4201.679
a roundabout

4199.679 --> 4203.76
from the rotating reference frame it

4201.679 --> 4207.36
appears that the drone

4203.76 --> 4210.4800000000005
is deviating but as we can see

4207.36 --> 4212.4
the drone just goes up and hovers it

4210.48 --> 4215.599999999999
doesn't go anywhere

4212.4 --> 4218.48
this is an apparent deviation

4215.6 --> 4219.4400000000005
okay we get your point the scale is

4218.48 --> 4222.5599999999995
slightly off

4219.44 --> 4224.4
but hey well done and this is what

4222.56 --> 4228.4800000000005
globes will tell you is happening

4224.4 --> 4230.96
when you see stars rotating in the sky

4228.48 --> 4232.08
but what this also demonstrates is what

4230.96 --> 4234.4800000000005
we observe

4232.08 --> 4235.199
from the inertial reference frame while

4234.48 --> 4237.28
looking at

4235.199 --> 4238.4
another thing in the inertial reference

4237.28 --> 4240.8
frame

4238.4 --> 4242.239
this drone is in the inertial reference

4240.8 --> 4244.08
frame

4242.239 --> 4246.08
and the camera looking at the drone and

4244.08 --> 4248.4
the roundabout is also

4246.08 --> 4249.76
in the inertial reference frame so as

4248.4 --> 4252.0
you can see

4249.76 --> 4253.4400000000005
when viewing something else in the

4252.0 --> 4256.0
inertial reference frame

4253.44 --> 4256.719
from the inertial reference frame the

4256.0 --> 4259.76
drone

4256.719 --> 4261.199
is no longer appearing to move yes yes

4259.76 --> 4264.2390000000005
yes but how does all this

4261.199 --> 4266.48
prove that we don't rotate

4264.239 --> 4267.5199999999995
so let's take another look at the stars

4266.48 --> 4269.44
and this time

4267.52 --> 4272.0
we're going to leave the asserted

4269.44 --> 4274.48
rotating reference frame of the earth

4272.0 --> 4275.28
and enter the inertial reference frame

4274.48 --> 4278.5599999999995
above

4275.28 --> 4280.159
the earth these stars

4278.56 --> 4283.1990000000005
are already in the inertial reference

4280.159 --> 4286.0
frame so when we view

4283.199 --> 4287.36
from the drone entering the inertial

4286.0 --> 4290.48
reference frame

4287.36 --> 4292.88
the stars should not move

4290.48 --> 4294.718999999999
just like when we see the drone in the

4292.88 --> 4298.8
inertial reference frame

4294.719 --> 4302.56
it does not move but we still see

4298.8 --> 4306.56
the stars moving

4302.56 --> 4306.56
um ah

4307.36 --> 4310.0
how do i

4311.199 --> 4317.5199999999995
only joking mitchell your drone remains

4314.8 --> 4318.2390000000005
in the rotating reference frame it does

4317.52 --> 4321.4400000000005
not move

4318.239 --> 4322.5599999999995
into the inertial reference frame as you

4321.44 --> 4325.36
say

4322.56 --> 4327.280000000001
no if your drone is hovering over a

4325.36 --> 4329.759999999999
particular spot on earth

4327.28 --> 4332.639999999999
then it remains in rotation with the

4329.76 --> 4332.64
earth doesn't it

4333.44 --> 4341.36
i did a quick calculation and i tweeted

4337.52 --> 4343.84
the winning field goal in that game

4341.36 --> 4345.839999999999
was aided by a one-third of an inch

4343.84 --> 4349.360000000001
deflection to the right

4345.84 --> 4349.360000000001
from earth's rotation

4350.56 --> 4353.6
ah this must be embarrassing for you

4352.64 --> 4355.360000000001
simon dan

4353.6 --> 4357.92
not knowing how your own globe model

4355.36 --> 4360.5599999999995
works rebelling against your

4357.92 --> 4361.6
high priest astrophysicist neil degrasse

4360.56 --> 4364.320000000001
tyson

4361.6 --> 4364.96
who famously detailed how when a ball is

4364.32 --> 4366.799999999999
kicked

4364.96 --> 4368.4
it leaves the rotating reference frame

4366.8 --> 4370.719
of the earth and enters

4368.4 --> 4371.839999999999
the inertial reference frame making the

4370.719 --> 4374.4800000000005
ball seem to

4371.84 --> 4375.360000000001
apparently deviate due to the earth

4374.48 --> 4378.799999999999
rotating

4375.36 --> 4381.12
underneath this is coriolis simon dan

4378.8 --> 4383.6
so if we can see coriolis in something

4381.12 --> 4386.159
like a football with a short hang time

4383.6 --> 4386.719
we're damn well going to see coriolis in

4386.159 --> 4390.719
something

4386.719 --> 4393.92
like a drone with a very long hang time

4390.719 --> 4396.56
if the earth were actually spinning

4393.92 --> 4398.08
but you detail it correctly simon dan by

4396.56 --> 4398.96
saying we do not see an apparent

4398.08 --> 4401.44
deviation

4398.96 --> 4403.44
in the drone hovering therefore we do

4401.44 --> 4406.48
not have earth-based coriolis

4403.44 --> 4409.28
and we do not have a spinning earth

4406.48 --> 4410.959999999999
that's our argument simon dan welcome to

4409.28 --> 4413.199
flat earth

4410.96 --> 4414.32
but your little drone isn't leaving the

4413.199 --> 4416.639999999999
spinning earth

4414.32 --> 4416.639999999999
is it

4418.239 --> 4422.239
have you realized the implication of

4420.32 --> 4424.639999999999
this globus

4422.239 --> 4425.678999999999
the stars are the things that actually

4424.64 --> 4427.76
moving

4425.679 --> 4430.2390000000005
not the earth underneath it the thing is

4427.76 --> 4431.4400000000005
mitchell you're always going to see star

4430.239 --> 4434.4
trails

4431.44 --> 4435.759999999999
check out this picture from the iss

4434.4 --> 4438.799999999999
absolutely awesome

4435.76 --> 4439.52
and look star trek quality example simon

4438.8 --> 4441.12
dan

4439.52 --> 4443.4400000000005
but instead of going after the

4441.12 --> 4444.5599999999995
impossibility of star trails being seen

4443.44 --> 4446.799999999999
by the iss

4444.56 --> 4447.76
unless it's doing barrel rolls i'm going

4446.8 --> 4450.88
to attack

4447.76 --> 4453.360000000001
where the iss is in space you say

4450.88 --> 4454.400000000001
the sky vacuum yeah that violates

4453.36 --> 4456.639999999999
natural law

4454.4 --> 4457.839999999999
the gas we breathe would absolutely fill

4456.64 --> 4460.4800000000005
the available space

4457.84 --> 4462.2390000000005
of the sky vacuum as dictated in the

4460.48 --> 4465.199
second law of thermodynamics

4462.239 --> 4465.839999999999
this is entropy you think the iss can

4465.199 --> 4468.799999999999
reside

4465.84 --> 4470.64
in a place that violates natural law nah

4468.8 --> 4472.400000000001
space is fake mate

4470.64 --> 4474.4800000000005
and the earth is stationary as you

4472.4 --> 4477.199
detailed before your video

4474.48 --> 4478.0
is going downhill quick simon then if it

4477.199 --> 4480.96
were actually

4478.0 --> 4482.56
earth rotation making the stars appear

4480.96 --> 4485.76
to rotate

4482.56 --> 4488.96
then when we leave the spinning earth

4485.76 --> 4490.400000000001
we wouldn't see this the stars should

4488.96 --> 4493.679
stay still

4490.4 --> 4496.159
but yet they keep spinning

4493.679 --> 4496.96
but this also applies to all celestial

4496.159 --> 4499.44
bodies

4496.96 --> 4500.2390000000005
because you ballers assert that the sun

4499.44 --> 4504.159
sets

4500.239 --> 4507.28
and rises also due to earth rotation

4504.159 --> 4509.759999999999
so let's view the sun from the inertial

4507.28 --> 4513.759999999999
reference frame

4509.76 --> 4515.6
same argument same misunderstanding

4513.76 --> 4517.52
the drone has left the rotating

4515.6 --> 4522.2390000000005
reference frame of the earth

4517.52 --> 4526.4800000000005
but yet the sun still appears

4522.239 --> 4529.599999999999
to set we go up again

4526.48 --> 4529.599999999999
and the sun sets again

4529.76 --> 4535.679
this is not caused by earth rotation

4533.679 --> 4536.719
because the earth is not actually

4535.679 --> 4538.159
rotating

4536.719 --> 4539.92
mitchell from australia they're

4538.159 --> 4542.48
literally proving the curve by

4539.92 --> 4544.2390000000005
filming the sunset moving up higher and

4542.48 --> 4546.799999999999
watching it set again

4544.239 --> 4549.199
well done mitchell well done the curve

4546.8 --> 4549.52
you say simon dan well let me introduce

4549.199 --> 4552.32
you

4549.52 --> 4554.64
to our good friend the black swan which

4552.32 --> 4555.599999999999
absolutely demolishes the possibility of

4554.64 --> 4558.320000000001
any curvature

4555.6 --> 4560.08
and debunks the radius of your globe

4558.32 --> 4562.08
because in order to have a curve

4560.08 --> 4563.28
and block things like the sun and the

4562.08 --> 4565.04
bottom of ships

4563.28 --> 4566.88
you would need to have a geometric

4565.04 --> 4570.0
horizon which on a sphere

4566.88 --> 4570.400000000001
of radius 3959 miles can be no further

4570.0 --> 4572.719
than

4570.4 --> 4574.159
1.22 times the square root of the

4572.719 --> 4576.4
observer height in feet

4574.159 --> 4578.599999999999
so at an observer height of 8 feet the

4576.4 --> 4580.96
geometric horizon can be no more than

4578.6 --> 4582.56
3.46 miles simon dan

4580.96 --> 4584.96
but as you can see in the black swan

4582.56 --> 4586.0
image all those arrows are pointing to

4584.96 --> 4589.36
the horizon

4586.0 --> 4592.64
which are way past 10 miles yeah

4589.36 --> 4595.839999999999
your globe is good and dead no curvature

4592.64 --> 4597.12
no space and no rotation so have you

4595.84 --> 4600.32
actually got any evidence

4597.12 --> 4609.84
of this curvature you speak of simon dan

4600.32 --> 4609.84
oh wait a minute of course i have

4610.89 --> 4626.479
[Music]

4627.28 --> 4631.679
haha does that mean my table is evidence

4629.6 --> 4634.08
of curvature too simon dan

4631.679 --> 4634.96
nope wrong again you still fail to see

4634.08 --> 4637.84
how our world

4634.96 --> 4639.6
really works things disappear bottom up

4637.84 --> 4642.400000000001
as they move away from us

4639.6 --> 4643.1990000000005
not due to curvature but due to angular

4642.4 --> 4645.679
resolution

4643.199 --> 4647.919999999999
the angle from the observer to the coin

4645.679 --> 4651.28
has become so small that is no longer

4647.92 --> 4654.2390000000005
resolvable but if we increase the angle

4651.28 --> 4654.96
from the observer by zooming in this

4654.239 --> 4658.159
resolves

4654.96 --> 4659.12
the coin again it is not blocked by any

4658.159 --> 4661.28
curvature

4659.12 --> 4662.96
it is not blocked by anything at all

4661.28 --> 4664.96
just like your example of the boat

4662.96 --> 4665.6
disappearing bottom up as it moves away

4664.96 --> 4667.6
from us

4665.6 --> 4668.88
that angle from the observer to the

4667.6 --> 4671.6
bottom of the boat

4668.88 --> 4672.56
gradually gets so small that is

4671.6 --> 4674.96
unresolvable

4672.56 --> 4675.76
from the bottom up so to recap what

4674.96 --> 4679.92
we've learned

4675.76 --> 4683.12
from simon dan the earth does not spin

4679.92 --> 4686.88
space is fake and there

4683.12 --> 4686.88
is no curvature

4687.36 --> 4690.719
there we go another flat earth friday

4689.6 --> 4692.719
done and dusted

4690.719 --> 4694.64
and what a great one it was i do hope

4692.719 --> 4697.12
you enjoyed it if you did then please

4694.64 --> 4698.719
please do like and subscribe

4697.12 --> 4700.88
i'm also going to give the audience a

4698.719 --> 4704.08
bit of a twofer

4700.88 --> 4706.64
to line up nicely there we go so i've

4704.08 --> 4711.32
edited the short version of my

4706.64 --> 4713.1990000000005
longer version of my response to

4711.32 --> 4713.599999999999
thunderf00t and then i'll start the live

4713.199 --> 4716.639999999999
show

4713.6 --> 4718.159000000001
oh so close you just missed off that

4716.64 --> 4721.52
little bit on the end there

4718.159 --> 4724.719
you know an explanation for gases

4721.52 --> 4729.360000000001
dumbed down to the point that even flat

4724.719 --> 4731.76
earthers might be able to understand it

4729.36 --> 4732.719
might feel all available microstates

4731.76 --> 4734.2390000000005
entropy

4732.719 --> 4736.159
you've got to dumb it right down for

4734.239 --> 4739.12
somebody as moronic as thunderfoot

4736.159 --> 4740.32
don't mention microstates underfoot's

4739.12 --> 4742.08
never going to understand such

4740.32 --> 4743.5199999999995
terminology microstates

4742.08 --> 4746.08
you're getting way too complicated for a

4743.52 --> 4748.88
clown see i can add home tooth underfoot

4746.08 --> 4750.08
you [ __ ] you understand what microstate

4748.88 --> 4751.76
is [ __ ]

4750.08 --> 4753.36
yeah nobel prize waiting for you if you

4751.76 --> 4754.0
violate the second law of thermodynamics

4753.36 --> 4757.5199999999995
thunderfoot

4754.0 --> 4757.92
you won't uh a vacuum and if i open the

4757.52 --> 4759.96
tap

4757.92 --> 4761.4400000000005
between these two you will see

4759.96 --> 4764.96
spontaneously

4761.44 --> 4767.12
the bromine rush from one to the other

4764.96 --> 4768.719
all that happens is a change in entropy

4767.12 --> 4770.4
the expansion into a vacuum

4768.719 --> 4772.56
nothing else is involved there's no

4770.4 --> 4773.199
energy change there's no temperature

4772.56 --> 4775.76
change

4773.199 --> 4776.5599999999995
there's no change except entropy the gas

4775.76 --> 4779.92
expands

4776.56 --> 4781.04
into a vacuum and the skies claim to be

4779.92 --> 4783.4400000000005
a vacuum

4781.04 --> 4784.96
and available space for that entropy

4783.44 --> 4788.239
increase to take place

4784.96 --> 4789.28
and what he's just described is natural

4788.239 --> 4792.718999999999
law

4789.28 --> 4795.5199999999995
in inviolable applicable always

4792.719 --> 4797.28
i am correct here that will never change

4795.52 --> 4799.040000000001
therefore he will not have a response

4797.28 --> 4801.44
we need to see gas pressure without the

4799.04 --> 4804.159
necessary antecedent of a container

4801.44 --> 4805.599999999999
in violation of natural law to justify

4804.159 --> 4808.159
your fundamentalist religious

4805.6 --> 4809.679
assertion that the sky is a vacuum in

4808.159 --> 4811.04
violation of the second law of

4809.679 --> 4812.639
thermodynamics

4811.04 --> 4814.48
your current rebuttal as it stands is

4812.639 --> 4815.84
gas go down go boom boom like bouncy

4814.48 --> 4817.678999999999
balls

4815.84 --> 4820.4800000000005
because it's got a downward vector with

4817.679 --> 4822.08
gravity that is not how gas behaves gas

4820.48 --> 4823.678999999999
does not require sweeping up

4822.08 --> 4825.28
it does not go down go boom boom with a

4823.679 --> 4827.6
single vector of gravity

4825.28 --> 4828.32
that is not what gas does thunderfoot is

4827.6 --> 4829.76
wrong

4828.32 --> 4832.32
he simply doesn't understand gas

4829.76 --> 4834.96
behavior he's been demonstrated a [ __ ]

4832.32 --> 4837.599999999999
by us which is why he's responded

4834.96 --> 4838.719
now more on clown show thunderfoot take

4837.6 --> 4840.88
this is my response

4838.719 --> 4842.56
obviously we wouldn't get into the

4840.88 --> 4843.28
detail of microstates with someone like

4842.56 --> 4845.679
thunderfoot

4843.28 --> 4847.679
we need to dumb this right down for a

4845.679 --> 4849.04
clown that thinks the gas behaves like

4847.679 --> 4851.679
bouncy balls

4849.04 --> 4852.96
it doesn't none of the gas in that

4851.679 --> 4855.04
demonstration

4852.96 --> 4856.719
fell to the bottom of the chamber the

4855.04 --> 4859.76
bromine rush

4856.719 --> 4862.0
from one to the other

4859.76 --> 4864.96
didn't behave like thunderfoot's bouncy

4862.0 --> 4867.679
balls he's a [ __ ]

4864.96 --> 4869.199
and how proud it is to tell this [ __ ]

4867.679 --> 4872.0
globe believing [ __ ]

4869.199 --> 4873.5199999999995
how moronic he is as a flat earther who

4872.0 --> 4876.08
does understand entropy

4873.52 --> 4877.84
who does understand how fake spaces and

4876.08 --> 4879.44
how he's been deceived

4877.84 --> 4880.96
and how that deception has left him

4879.44 --> 4883.599999999999
making declarations of

4880.96 --> 4886.0
absolute stupidity to audiences of

4883.6 --> 4887.679
almost a million people

4886.0 --> 4889.52
almost a million people being poisoned

4887.679 --> 4892.159
with his abject stupidity

4889.52 --> 4893.84
about how gas behaves no practical

4892.159 --> 4896.96
demonstration with a gas

4893.84 --> 4899.28
in pouring a solid into a fish tank

4896.96 --> 4900.4
i really enjoy telling thunderfoot how

4899.28 --> 4902.4
stupid he is

4900.4 --> 4903.599999999999
with with total justification and a

4902.4 --> 4906.0
smile on my face

4903.6 --> 4907.92
not you didn't understand me pouring

4906.0 --> 4909.76
bouncy balls into a fish tank

4907.92 --> 4911.679
it was dumbed down too much for you flat

4909.76 --> 4913.76
earthers no

4911.679 --> 4915.4400000000005
we have natural law which we can

4913.76 --> 4917.1990000000005
describe with the number of available

4915.44 --> 4919.759999999999
microstates that would be on offer

4917.199 --> 4921.12
by a sky vacuum because we understand

4919.76 --> 4923.52
entropy here thunderfoot

4921.12 --> 4925.12
unlike you you [ __ ] who thinks that

4923.52 --> 4928.56
solids behave like gases

4925.12 --> 4929.5199999999995
making you thick we all proud to be

4928.56 --> 4932.400000000001
telling this

4929.52 --> 4933.52
million subscriber [ __ ] globe head how

4932.4 --> 4944.54
thick he is

4933.52 --> 4960.830000000001
i'm proud proud to be a flat earther

4944.54 --> 4960.83
[Music]

4967.52 --> 4976.320000000001
what a lovely day

4973.13 --> 4981.76
[Music]

4976.32 --> 4981.759999999999
