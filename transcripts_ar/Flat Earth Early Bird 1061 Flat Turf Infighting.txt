journalism i was absolutely gonna bring

that was exhilarating to me

349.12 --> 352.0
like

349.919 --> 354.08
i got in there in chat for a moment but

352.0 --> 356.24
somebody just seems to keep banning me i

354.08 --> 357.919
sent jaren an email if he could please

356.24 --> 359.759
unban me and maybe give me a wrench

357.919 --> 362.31899999999996

369.68 --> 372.96
guy

370.8 --> 372.96000000000004
so

376.24 --> 379.88
hello mike sadoonich

386.639 --> 391.44
yeah i'll get into that

388.88 --> 394.0
this show backs because that's a big

391.44 --> 395.28
part of

394.0 --> 397.039
like

395.28 --> 399.52
for some reason yesterday a lot of

397.039 --> 400.4
things like came together and resolved

399.52 --> 403.919
for me

400.4 --> 406.88
and in the night before going to bed

403.919 --> 408.79999999999995
it's that that was a magical moment and

406.88 --> 411.039
i'm gonna try to describe it before my

408.8 --> 413.52000000000004
mood's completely ruined by all this

411.039 --> 414.639
people passing away

413.52 --> 417.039
but

414.639 --> 418.24
went outside at what is it it's been

417.039 --> 421.039
like

418.24 --> 423.36
two or three o'clock

421.039 --> 425.36
i wasn't feeling like oh i gotta calm

423.36 --> 426.88
down because i play the computer game

425.36 --> 429.36
and i'm all shaky

426.88 --> 431.12
because that happens sometimes but i was

429.36 --> 434.96000000000004
really calm

431.12 --> 438.639
and i heard this bird singing outside

434.96 --> 439.84
like very late in a very weird

438.639 --> 442.0
time of year

439.84 --> 445.599
it's not like it was cold

442.0 --> 448.319
but it was elaborately singing

445.599 --> 449.919
like was it a black bird

448.319 --> 452.16
it might have been another type of

449.919 --> 453.68
singing bird i i didn't straight out

452.16 --> 455.59900000000005
recognize it

453.68 --> 456.919
but it was singing beautifully and it

455.599 --> 459.44
was a

456.919 --> 461.19899999999996
supremely clear sky

459.44 --> 463.599
it was so clear

461.199 --> 465.039
unbelief i've not seen a clear sky like

463.599 --> 467.039
that

465.039 --> 469.28
in a while

467.039 --> 472.31899999999996
it was so clear that like

469.28 --> 473.919
you could see every star

472.319 --> 478.36
and not only that

473.919 --> 478.35999999999996
i actually saw some falling stars

479.599 --> 484.8
yeah

480.879 --> 489.28000000000003
and at the same time that bird singing

484.8 --> 491.12
so like i was outside and just like wow

489.28 --> 493.84
this is creation

491.12 --> 493.84000000000003
that's amazing

494.0 --> 500.479
and i don't know maybe i like got a wish

496.08 --> 500.479
with the falling star superstition but

501.599 --> 503.919
you know

504.639 --> 508.879
it means you'll be able to help better

506.4 --> 511.12
with with paypal support i appreciate

508.879 --> 511.12
that

511.52 --> 515.76
all right yeah by the way about

513.2 --> 517.839
brandon's i've heard about

515.76 --> 519.2
brandon he's okay he's

517.839 --> 521.519
just

519.2 --> 524.8000000000001
he's engaged with the job himself that

521.519 --> 526.64
has a difficult time slot so he can't

524.8 --> 529.5999999999999
really do his usual show at that time

526.64 --> 531.1999999999999
anymore so that's the reason why

529.6 --> 532.24
he hasn't been doing shows he's all

531.2 --> 535.839
right

532.24 --> 535.839
don't worry about brandon

540.959 --> 545.5999999999999
i think maybe with all the let's go

542.959 --> 548.399
brandon everywhere he kind of like

545.6 --> 549.6
felt personally uh

548.399 --> 551.519
motivated

549.6 --> 553.12
like okay if everybody's gonna say let's

551.519 --> 555.68
go

553.12 --> 555.68
let's go

557.68 --> 559.92
all right

560.88 --> 565.8389999999999
oh my god

562.48 --> 569.279
been ill for all right

565.839 --> 569.2790000000001
wow squirrel sniper that's

570.32 --> 572.1600000000001
but

571.2 --> 574.1600000000001
did he

572.16 --> 575.1999999999999
he didn't like take a v or anything

574.16 --> 578.16
right

575.2 --> 578.1600000000001
like how was he ill

578.399 --> 584.32
what was he on i don't know

581.04 --> 584.3199999999999
it's a little too soon

588.88 --> 593.92
oh i'm a hobby

591.36 --> 596.88
oriented

593.92 --> 598.7199999999999
oriental log okay

596.88 --> 601.36
been working

598.72 --> 604.36
small big birds cool

601.36 --> 604.36
interesting

607.12 --> 613.76
right yeah yeah it's great well

610.24 --> 615.839
it at least he didn't like

613.76 --> 619.399
go through the c procedure or something

615.839 --> 619.399
creepy like that

626.8 --> 629.4399999999999
but yeah

629.92 --> 633.56
so i guess

634.56 --> 640.399
just give them some space right

636.88 --> 640.399
it's it's just like with uh

643.519 --> 647.36
with rob skiba you know you don't you

646.24 --> 649.6800000000001
don't just

647.36 --> 651.519
immediately dive on there and start ah

649.68 --> 654.16
answer the question

651.519 --> 657.12
we need to know every detail

654.16 --> 659.68
because this is a real shock you know

657.12 --> 663.6
it's like terrible you need to get give

659.68 --> 663.5999999999999
like the widow some space and all that

666.32 --> 671.399
so yeah i'm very sorry to hear that

679.279 --> 685.8389999999999
and it was not that old at all so i

681.76 --> 688.3199999999999
don't know yeah bit of a mystery maybe

685.839 --> 690.8800000000001
taking blood samples yeah perhaps well

688.32 --> 692.48
it also depends on like the widow like

690.88 --> 695.279
how

692.48 --> 697.6
medically curious they are like does

695.279 --> 699.04
will she dive onto that figure it out or

697.6 --> 701.2
is she just going to be like i don't

699.04 --> 703.519
want to know it at all anymore

701.2 --> 705.839
it's difficult it's very difficult all

703.519 --> 705.839
of that

706.16 --> 708.48
right

713.76 --> 718.16
i don't know i don't know maybe he had

717.2 --> 720.9590000000001
some

718.16 --> 725.12
disease issue going that he

720.959 --> 725.1199999999999
didn't tell anybody about you don't know

726.72 --> 731.6
but it yeah it is a shock surprise

729.44 --> 733.0400000000001
to me

731.6 --> 736.36
i mean the guy was

733.04 --> 736.36
pretty young

744.399 --> 746.72
right

750.24 --> 755.76
anyway yeah yesterday

753.68 --> 757.4399999999999
my show started out i thought it was

755.76 --> 758.639
kind of like uh

757.44 --> 760.639
but then

758.639 --> 763.2
it got better

760.639 --> 764.639
and then my healer calls and i like

763.2 --> 767.9200000000001
burst it open

764.639 --> 770.5600000000001
over at that after that point

767.92 --> 773.36
it's full energy and i kind of feel like

770.56 --> 775.1999999999999
that again

773.36 --> 777.44
because it put so many things like it

775.2 --> 780.1600000000001
was really magical to me

777.44 --> 782.8000000000001
also like my healer can do things that

780.16 --> 785.1999999999999
are literally like magic to me

782.8 --> 787.1999999999999
and the weird thing is that

785.2 --> 790.0
i seem to have the ability to do that

787.2 --> 791.6800000000001
too but when you do it yourself it's

790.0 --> 792.88
just like

791.68 --> 795.279
normal

792.88 --> 796.24
you can't but when somebody else just

795.279 --> 797.36
calls

796.24 --> 798.24
out like

797.36 --> 800.8000000000001
yeah

798.24 --> 803.04
that time when they haven't i haven't

800.8 --> 806.399
spoken to my healer at all like and he

803.04 --> 807.1999999999999
just said look it was monday like

806.399 --> 808.959
but

807.2 --> 810.88
how do you know something happened on

808.959 --> 812.8
monday

810.88 --> 815.76
that's magical to me

812.8 --> 817.68
but he just knows that he just i don't

815.76 --> 819.199
know how he does it

817.68 --> 821.04
well i i kind of

819.199 --> 822.959
can guess how he does it's just that

821.04 --> 824.8
he's so good at it it's just baffling to

822.959 --> 828.279
me sometimes right

824.8 --> 828.279
but uh

829.36 --> 834.399
right

831.04 --> 837.5999999999999
anyway yeah the whole rv situation

834.399 --> 837.6
came to a climax

837.68 --> 842.0
because i did also bring it up for a bit

839.92 --> 844.0
over at flat earth debates got a lot of

842.0 --> 846.24
like

844.0 --> 848.24
counter push i didn't appreciate it

846.24 --> 850.88
though i was actually kind of agitated

848.24 --> 853.04
on yesterday's flat earth debate

850.88 --> 855.04
over in during the entire show i rage

853.04 --> 857.92
quit twice

855.04 --> 860.7199999999999
because i i just got like ah why are you

857.92 --> 863.04
all pushing against me maybe i just was

860.72 --> 865.36
a little too strong energy too much

863.04 --> 867.12
strong energy

865.36 --> 869.519
too pushy

867.12 --> 871.68
right but anyway later of course on

869.519 --> 874.48
journalism

871.68 --> 877.5999999999999
with david wise and alex dean

874.48 --> 878.72
rv came on there

877.6 --> 881.519
and

878.72 --> 883.519
went full blown savannie

881.519 --> 886.48
full-blown

883.519 --> 886.48
and it was

886.639 --> 890.8
embarrassing

888.639 --> 893.279
and i was impressed

890.8 --> 895.04
but especially by jared jaren was like

893.279 --> 898.639
so

895.04 --> 901.8389999999999
stable and on target it was like bravo

898.639 --> 904.0790000000001
darren bravo you you had

901.839 --> 906.399
absolute control there you did a great

904.079 --> 906.399
job

907.279 --> 911.279
very

908.24 --> 913.44
very great attitude david weiss well

911.279 --> 917.36
david weiss just got really agitated

913.44 --> 919.7600000000001
because the guy kept rumpusing him like

917.36 --> 922.0790000000001
and eventually just it was like shut the

919.76 --> 923.6
hell up shut that and that's exactly

922.079 --> 925.8389999999999
what i would do

923.6 --> 927.1990000000001
and i kind of do do that and i totally

925.839 --> 929.9200000000001
get it david

927.199 --> 933.279
because he was a complete [ __ ] with

929.92 --> 935.04
ridiculous accusations ridiculous

933.279 --> 937.519
and you addressed it

935.04 --> 937.519
and he just

937.759 --> 942.9590000000001
just glanced past it and then said like

940.32 --> 945.12
oh no no it's it's i don't really mean

942.959 --> 946.8
it that bad and then later

945.12 --> 949.839
re-double down on it even though he

946.8 --> 951.199
dispelled it himself totally ridiculous

949.839 --> 954.0
rambling

951.199 --> 957.12
like a funny zealot

954.0 --> 957.12
almost like a baller

957.279 --> 966.32
it was ridiculous and i felt

961.04 --> 966.3199999999999
a great relief because i was like really

966.399 --> 973.36
i got yeah after the the show yesterday

969.519 --> 973.36
night no wait two days ago

973.6 --> 977.9200000000001
with rv rambling on like that i had the

976.079 --> 980.8
feeling like this is bad this is bad and

977.92 --> 982.8
i talked about it on my show yesterday

980.8 --> 986.0
and i just felt like yeah i called it

982.8 --> 988.079
man and it's so good like how it roll

986.0 --> 989.44
out i'm very happy

988.079 --> 991.199
because

989.44 --> 993.36
i don't know what it is man i i don't

991.199 --> 996.4799999999999
even necessarily want to go in too much

993.36 --> 998.0790000000001
of a character analysis rv

996.48 --> 1000.24
i think he's just

998.079 --> 1003.7589999999999
feeling bad

1000.24 --> 1005.6800000000001
like he probably is being hit by the

1003.759 --> 1007.36
ancestral winds

1005.68 --> 1010.56
so it's agitated

1007.36 --> 1013.279
and then he goes into savage mode

1010.56 --> 1014.7199999999999
starts like oh okay i'm so

1013.279 --> 1015.8389999999999
[ __ ] up i need something to do i'm

1014.72 --> 1019.279
just gonna

1015.839 --> 1021.36
conspirate about people

1019.279 --> 1024.24
he's done it many times before and he's

1021.36 --> 1026.24
not necessarily always like that but he

1024.24 --> 1027.76
gets like that and he certainly is like

1026.24 --> 1030.88
that right now

1027.76 --> 1030.8799999999999
total safari

1032.959 --> 1038.48
and not productive and

1035.679 --> 1041.1200000000001
crazy because you end up contradicting

1038.48 --> 1043.1200000000001
yourself really badly just like some

1041.12 --> 1045.4389999999999
ballers do when you hold their toes to

1043.12 --> 1047.6
the fire

1045.439 --> 1049.76
i'm just glad

1047.6 --> 1053.6
that happened

1049.76 --> 1056.8799999999999
that that was exposed and then yeah well

1053.6 --> 1058.559
kind of indirectly body proud

1056.88 --> 1061.44
of jaren and

1058.559 --> 1061.44
and david weiss

1062.4 --> 1066.6000000000001
because i do respect those guys

1067.6 --> 1071.36
and i yeah i heard a lot of like

1069.44 --> 1073.6000000000001
detailed opinion like they got really

1071.36 --> 1075.52
detailed in opinions they took it all

1073.6 --> 1077.6
very serious

1075.52 --> 1081.08
and i heard some really interesting

1077.6 --> 1081.08
smart things

1087.039 --> 1089.36
anyway

1093.52 --> 1097.679
i feel great but yeah the hearing about

1096.4 --> 1100.24
the

1097.679 --> 1104.2
flat earth poker it's not great that's a

1100.24 --> 1104.2
bit of a bummer

1109.52 --> 1114.76
and it's crooked in-house oh yeah hello

1111.76 --> 1114.76
crockett

1126.48 --> 1131.919
okay you take bird blood samples

1129.6 --> 1131.9189999999999
weird

1133.28 --> 1138.08
anything interesting any interesting

1135.76 --> 1140.16
developing concerning that i mean

1138.08 --> 1141.6789999999999
are the bird blood oak is the bird butt

1140.16 --> 1143.1200000000001
blood okay

1141.679 --> 1146.96
for starters

1143.12 --> 1146.9599999999998
nothing freaky going on or anything

1154.48 --> 1157.919
i hate the money system fiat rick scam

1156.88 --> 1160.48
back to

1157.919 --> 1162.64
trade yeah absolutely

1160.48 --> 1166.88
and the crazier the money system becomes

1162.64 --> 1166.88
the more controlled

1168.48 --> 1171.28
yeah

1170.16 --> 1174.72
it's

1171.28 --> 1177.12
good and legal to revert back to just

1174.72 --> 1181.44
trading

1177.12 --> 1181.4399999999998
an item for an item or item for service

1185.6 --> 1191.36
that's a great idea and it's also legal

1189.2 --> 1193.3600000000001
that's why it's extra great like there's

1191.36 --> 1195.1999999999998
no like oh we have to find some other

1193.36 --> 1197.52
way but now we're gonna have to go

1195.2 --> 1200.4
against the system but justify it no

1197.52 --> 1203.12
because that really sucks

1200.4 --> 1206.3600000000001
this is legal just barter

1203.12 --> 1206.36
is legal

1211.12 --> 1214.12
anyway

1225.039 --> 1228.039
hmm

1240.48 --> 1246.0
ah i probably feel great as well because

1242.24 --> 1246.0
i had just had a lot of sleep yesterday

1246.799 --> 1250.799
i kind of slept after the flutter

1249.679 --> 1252.96
debates

1250.799 --> 1254.24
took a hot shower because i was really

1252.96 --> 1256.88
just cold

1254.24 --> 1259.84
like i am

1256.88 --> 1259.8400000000001
feeling the colds

1261.12 --> 1266.559
also especially right after i smoke

1263.84 --> 1269.559
then it's just like

1266.559 --> 1269.559
annoying

1292.32 --> 1296.0
okay

1293.44 --> 1297.919
so yeah what are you guys all up to is

1296.0 --> 1301.28
there anything in particular you want me

1297.919 --> 1301.2800000000002
to talk about or address

1302.08 --> 1306.6399999999999
it's been five minutes since somebody

1303.84 --> 1306.6399999999999
last commented

1316.64 --> 1320.4
i'll just go through videos

1323.44 --> 1328.88
yeah i checked out

1324.96 --> 1332.48
raycheese uploaded a video richie

1328.88 --> 1335.919
quintuple zero

1332.48 --> 1335.919
like she's very technical

1341.52 --> 1345.52
i actually asked her a question in her

1343.76 --> 1348.24
comment section like

1345.52 --> 1351.12
could you educate me on

1348.24 --> 1353.039
like the math and the units for the

1351.12 --> 1355.36
relative density this equilibrium

1353.039 --> 1357.36
because

1355.36 --> 1360.36
i totally get

1357.36 --> 1360.36
basically

1363.76 --> 1366.48
what's the word

1368.88 --> 1371.2800000000002
damn it

1372.88 --> 1378.159
i did the early exploration

1375.76 --> 1380.559
digging through relative density when it

1378.159 --> 1383.1200000000001
yeah like when it was really an item

1380.559 --> 1386.8799999999999
with the tony doing the experiments and

1383.12 --> 1389.12
i just like i completely theorized

1386.88 --> 1391.1200000000001
well colloquial theorized

1389.12 --> 1393.36
and described like how does it work did

1391.12 --> 1395.4399999999998
this equilibrium force how it translated

1393.36 --> 1398.0
pressure how it all balances out

1395.44 --> 1400.8400000000001
everything right so i know exactly how

1398.0 --> 1404.0
relative density works like i am a

1400.84 --> 1406.8799999999999
master and anybody can test me on that

1404.0 --> 1409.2
but not the math part like i'm not the

1406.88 --> 1411.44
guy that's just like oh here's here's

1409.2 --> 1414.799
the exact formula

1411.44 --> 1417.76
and here's the units like i

1414.799 --> 1419.9189999999999
i think i treated that at one point it

1417.76 --> 1422.32
just i forget it again

1419.919 --> 1424.88
i'm just more about the actual

1422.32 --> 1428.72
understanding of it what happens how it

1424.88 --> 1432.48
happens and not the exactness

1428.72 --> 1432.48
mathematical implications

1435.52 --> 1441.08
but reggie seems to have a pretty good

1437.2 --> 1441.0800000000002
grip on that sort of thing

1446.08 --> 1450.36
yeah are you talking about

1463.279 --> 1466.88
more more

1464.799 --> 1469.8799999999999
what is that i don't know what a marmor

1466.88 --> 1469.88
is

1472.0 --> 1476.64
is that a band or something

1474.08 --> 1476.6399999999999
what what

1480.24 --> 1485.2
do i like iron maiden no not

1482.4 --> 1487.52
particularly i mean they're kind of fun

1485.2 --> 1490.799
at concerts i've seen iron maiden a lot

1487.52 --> 1492.799
at live concerts like festivals and all

1490.799 --> 1495.84
that they're around

1492.799 --> 1495.84
and it's great fun

1496.08 --> 1500.96
but

1498.159 --> 1503.5200000000002
it's not something like oh man i wanna

1500.96 --> 1504.64
i wanna hear my iron maiden every day

1503.52 --> 1506.1589999999999
no

1504.64 --> 1508.96
but they're pretty cool

1506.159 --> 1508.96
they're they're okay

1510.88 --> 1517.0390000000002
and they're really good at their routine

1513.52 --> 1517.039
in live performances i think

1520.48 --> 1524.44
neighbor of the beast

1528.32 --> 1533.24
hello gorzilla

1530.24 --> 1533.24
37.

1546.48 --> 1550.96
approximately

1547.96 --> 1554.44
830 dollars here in norway what what are

1550.96 --> 1554.44
you talking about

1571.039 --> 1576.48
max i i literally don't understand what

1574.559 --> 1578.72
you're talking about now i don't see

1576.48 --> 1578.72
like

1580.72 --> 1587.1200000000001
an lp album what that has to do with

1583.679 --> 1589.919
silver i really don't get it

1587.12 --> 1591.52
i mean did you trade it did you have

1589.919 --> 1595.039
did you like

1591.52 --> 1598.039
trade the silver for the albums or

1595.039 --> 1598.039
something

1598.799 --> 1602.44
like why

1616.799 --> 1621.039
yeah yeah okay that's cool bax the price

1619.2 --> 1622.799
of silver and norway that's nice that

1621.039 --> 1626.279
doesn't help me understand what the hell

1622.799 --> 1626.279
you're talking about

1630.559 --> 1633.559
so

1646.159 --> 1649.919
okay

1647.679 --> 1653.2
so the album is 83

1649.919 --> 1657.1200000000001
what does that have to do with silver

1653.2 --> 1657.1200000000001
i don't understand what you're saying

1662.0 --> 1665.76
i mean does anybody else here understand

1663.919 --> 1669.3600000000001
what he's talking about maybe this is

1665.76 --> 1670.24
just completely eluding me

1669.36 --> 1673.12
like

1670.24 --> 1675.679
let me just read it out anyone like iron

1673.12 --> 1677.36
maiden no question mark by the way

1675.679 --> 1680.72
i could not resist yesterday and bought

1677.36 --> 1683.4399999999998
their latest triple lp album with three

1680.72 --> 1685.52
more more don't even know what a murmur

1683.44 --> 1690.559
is lps

1685.52 --> 1694.24
one with 180 grams of 99.99 pure silver

1690.559 --> 1697.039
one in black marmor one and one

1694.24 --> 1701.72
what the hell does that mean

1697.039 --> 1701.72
what the hell are you talking about

1710.64 --> 1715.2
yeah that's cool fun and in but i don't

1713.12 --> 1717.279
understand it

1715.2 --> 1721.1200000000001
can you just

1717.279 --> 1721.12
explain what you said

1721.279 --> 1728.399
the album was in silver you mean the

1725.039 --> 1729.919
case of it was silver

1728.399 --> 1731.9189999999999
what do you mean what does that mean the

1729.919 --> 1734.88
album was in silver was the record

1731.919 --> 1738.2
itself made of pure silver what are you

1734.88 --> 1738.2
talking about

1743.6 --> 1748.559
i don't know the phraseology of in

1746.559 --> 1753.24
silver when it concerns albums that's

1748.559 --> 1753.24
i've never heard of that before ever

1760.88 --> 1764.159
red marmor

1762.64 --> 1767.679
one in black

1764.159 --> 1770.7990000000002
so you're talking about the casings

1767.679 --> 1772.72
so was the color silver

1770.799 --> 1776.399
red warmer and black

1772.72 --> 1778.3990000000001
or was it actually made of the material

1776.399 --> 1782.4799999999998
silver

1778.399 --> 1785.12
lp made in silver so the record itself

1782.48 --> 1789.679
was silver finally

1785.12 --> 1789.6789999999999
my god that only took like 10 minutes

1793.2 --> 1796.88
right it's just like oh yeah the outfit

1795.039 --> 1798.96
wasn't silver it's like oh of course

1796.88 --> 1801.7600000000002
everybody immediately understand what

1798.96 --> 1804.559
that means because like yeah

1801.76 --> 1806.96
silver albums like the record itself

1804.559 --> 1808.8799999999999
made of silver that's everywhere why

1806.96 --> 1810.64
wouldn't you automatically understand

1808.88 --> 1813.44
that no it's the very first time i've

1810.64 --> 1813.44
ever heard of that

1814.48 --> 1820.08
it's just clarity buddy now you don't

1816.72 --> 1820.08
have to apologize just

1821.36 --> 1824.7199999999998
would be great

1823.279 --> 1826.72
if you just

1824.72 --> 1829.44
explain it

1826.72 --> 1831.039
quickly and concisely

1829.44 --> 1832.96
that you understand what's being

1831.039 --> 1834.799
misunderstood

1832.96 --> 1836.799
anyway

1834.799 --> 1838.8799999999999
cool

1836.799 --> 1840.32
interesting

1838.88 --> 1841.3600000000001
well it's always good to have pure

1840.32 --> 1843.6
silver

1841.36 --> 1846.399
one way or the other just like that's

1843.6 --> 1851.24
part of the reason i got this pendant

1846.399 --> 1851.2399999999998
i i consider it a medical device

1859.36 --> 1864.24
well if it's very rare to you then why

1862.399 --> 1867.6789999999999
would you just assume that everybody

1864.24 --> 1867.679
understood what you were talking about

1872.96 --> 1876.3990000000001
hey america's silver patriot

1877.84 --> 1881.6
yes stop and traffic in my restaurant

1879.84 --> 1884.32
apparently he did

1881.6 --> 1886.8799999999999
pretty shocking

1884.32 --> 1889.6
apparently he died in his bed at home at

1886.88 --> 1891.7600000000002
sleeping sleep unexpectedly

1889.6 --> 1892.399
after being sick for a while i don't

1891.76 --> 1894.96
know

1892.399 --> 1894.9599999999998
what happened

1895.36 --> 1898.1589999999999
i just heard it

1901.6 --> 1906.7199999999998
yeah what the [ __ ] indeed right he was

1903.76 --> 1909.279
he was young

1906.72 --> 1911.919
so nobody yet really knows what's going

1909.279 --> 1914.399
on how that's happening

1911.919 --> 1916.72
but at least he didn't get like

1914.399 --> 1918.7199999999998
killed in the hospital through

1916.72 --> 1921.84
the sea protocols

1918.72 --> 1921.84
that's at least something

1940.24 --> 1944.96
coin collector old coins yeah oh i used

1943.039 --> 1947.279
to do that well not really a collector

1944.96 --> 1950.0
but i used to kind of like horde silver

1947.279 --> 1952.799
i became a goldsmith because of the tax

1950.0 --> 1955.2
advantages that it brought

1952.799 --> 1958.32
i bought a lot of like

1955.2 --> 1959.8400000000001
gold bullion and silver well not a lot

1958.32 --> 1960.84
a song

1959.84 --> 1965.039
but that's

1960.84 --> 1966.72
like 15 years ago now

1965.039 --> 1968.8799999999999
i don't have anything of it i had so

1966.72 --> 1970.799
sold it all since then it's really

1968.88 --> 1973.919
embarrassing

1970.799 --> 1973.9189999999999
i wish i still had it

1975.039 --> 1980.72
i still got one coin but that is like a

1977.279 --> 1983.72
collector thing to me it's a mexican one

1980.72 --> 1983.72
anyway

1997.919 --> 2000.919
so

2020.799 --> 2024.799
yeah god rest his soul

2022.72 --> 2027.279
well at least

2024.799 --> 2029.039
at least he well considerably died a

2027.279 --> 2031.44
peaceful death

2029.039 --> 2031.44
you know

2031.6 --> 2037.6789999999999
but it's still like yeah shocking

2034.32 --> 2040.1589999999999
i understand so yeah i hope he he finds

2037.679 --> 2040.159
the piece

2040.24 --> 2045.559
the piece that's a weird way to say he

2041.84 --> 2045.559
finds peace yeah

2047.519 --> 2050.96
then i think he was definitely a

2049.119 --> 2054.159
believer in like afterlife so he's

2050.96 --> 2056.8
probably now continuing the journey on

2054.159 --> 2056.8
the other side

2058.399 --> 2062.3199999999997
it's weird though because that makes me

2060.72 --> 2064.1589999999997
kind of feel like

2062.32 --> 2065.76
that magical moment that i felt

2064.159 --> 2068.399
yesterday

2065.76 --> 2070.079
it's gonna [ __ ] very

2068.399 --> 2072.3199999999997
was that him

2070.079 --> 2073.679
that because i didn't know

2072.32 --> 2076.0
right

2073.679 --> 2078.2400000000002
and i had a similar uh not

2076.0 --> 2080.079
that i'm super close that i was super

2078.24 --> 2081.1189999999997
close to him or anything

2080.079 --> 2085.3590000000004
but like

2081.119 --> 2085.359
to [ __ ] her i did kind of like the guy

2085.679 --> 2089.2400000000002
but we like

2089.44 --> 2093.52
yeah when my mother died

2091.52 --> 2096.159
i saw her ghost

2093.52 --> 2098.96
and it was like before i learned that

2096.159 --> 2101.28
she died and and there was like a weird

2098.96 --> 2103.839
energy in the air i had so much clarity

2101.28 --> 2105.3590000000004
last night i just it's like inexplicable

2103.839 --> 2108.32
like

2105.359 --> 2110.3199999999997
a feeling like something happened

2108.32 --> 2112.88
but i don't know what something out

2110.32 --> 2116.079
there something in the field

2112.88 --> 2118.56
and it felt so peaceful like unusually

2116.079 --> 2118.5600000000004
peaceful

2118.96 --> 2123.76
and then there's the sky and it's a

2120.64 --> 2126.0
falling star and all that

2123.76 --> 2128.5600000000004
so i don't know maybe yeah

2126.0 --> 2130.4
his spirit did his rounds or something

2128.56 --> 2131.599
right after death and that's what i felt

2130.4 --> 2135.1600000000003
i don't know

2131.599 --> 2135.1600000000003
sounds very mystical

2147.92 --> 2154.56
so you guys have old coins laying around

2152.079 --> 2157.5600000000004
uh not so much

2154.56 --> 2157.56
bags

2158.079 --> 2162.6400000000003
like all most of the silver that i got

2160.24 --> 2163.7599999999998
at the time i kind of would buy

2162.64 --> 2165.68
new ones

2163.76 --> 2167.3590000000004
and most of them ended up coming from

2165.68 --> 2170.839
canada

2167.359 --> 2170.839
like the canadian

2172.079 --> 2178.1600000000003
with the leaf on it and all that

2174.8 --> 2178.1600000000003
but i don't have any of them left

2178.72 --> 2182.8799999999997
a lot of them had some weird production

2181.04 --> 2187.48
issues too like

2182.88 --> 2187.48
they would have this weird type of

2188.56 --> 2192.88
seemingly like a rust or something but

2190.96 --> 2195.04
it isn't like it would get a little

2192.88 --> 2197.04
whitish weird

2195.04 --> 2200.92
but anyway and we're still just

2197.04 --> 2200.92
perfectly fine silver

2203.119 --> 2208.6400000000003
but old coins i don't know i haven't

2205.119 --> 2208.6400000000003
really been looking around a lot

2210.64 --> 2214.48
i've never been like an old coin

2212.72 --> 2216.24
collector

2214.48 --> 2219.2400000000002
i've always been more of a mineral

2216.24 --> 2219.24
collector

2237.04 --> 2240.839
always security and having some suffer

2238.8 --> 2244.1600000000003
yeah i agree

2240.839 --> 2247.599
because of the nature of it like what

2244.16 --> 2250.64
especially the pure silver that is

2247.599 --> 2253.04
because of what you can do with silver

2250.64 --> 2255.2799999999997
especially medically

2253.04 --> 2257.7599999999998
yeah it's good to have it's like not

2255.28 --> 2258.6400000000003
just as a trading tool

2257.76 --> 2261.76
right

2258.64 --> 2264.48
you can actually apply it

2261.76 --> 2267.88
for certain things

2264.48 --> 2267.88
health related

2279.76 --> 2282.76
hmm

2328.88 --> 2331.2000000000003
hmm

2333.76 --> 2336.6400000000003
i wonder by the way if jeremy got my

2335.599 --> 2338.839
email

2336.64 --> 2341.92
i sent him an email

2338.839 --> 2344.48
yesterday like

2341.92 --> 2347.2000000000003
at the end of his stream

2344.48 --> 2349.04
to the what is it yahoo what is it yahoo

2347.2 --> 2351.2799999999997
or something

2349.04 --> 2352.72
it's the link on his

2351.28 --> 2354.88
youtube page

2352.72 --> 2356.7999999999997
had a email address ascended to that i

2354.88 --> 2360.32
haven't gotten any response i don't know

2356.8 --> 2363.28
how how much how many times

2360.32 --> 2366.56
how regularly he checks his email but i

2363.28 --> 2366.5600000000004
really do hope that he does

2366.72 --> 2369.839
just respond

2374.16 --> 2377.7999999999997
hello george sanford

2382.88 --> 2385.119
uh

2387.839 --> 2393.2
what provides more security having a gun

2390.88 --> 2396.2000000000003
or having silver

2393.2 --> 2396.2
uh

2396.24 --> 2399.839
that depends on your region

2399.92 --> 2404.88
right

2401.68 --> 2407.2799999999997
silver is when things can yeah when

2404.88 --> 2410.4
stability decreases

2407.28 --> 2411.76
guns are useful when things really go to

2410.4 --> 2415.7200000000003
hell

2411.76 --> 2415.7200000000003
so i'd say both

2429.2 --> 2433.359
right yeah clutch yeah totally agree but

2433.44 --> 2437.2000000000003
if you're in the middle of a city

2437.28 --> 2440.96
you know

2439.2 --> 2443.04
but yeah if you're in rural

2440.96 --> 2444.0
rural areas

2443.04 --> 2445.68
a gun

2444.0 --> 2448.4
probably be better

2445.68 --> 2449.44
more secure more useful things you can

2448.4 --> 2452.56
do with it

2449.44 --> 2453.68
but in the middle of big cities

2452.56 --> 2457.68
less

2453.68 --> 2460.16
unless like things really go to hell

2457.68 --> 2462.0
like like serious like an ending riots

2460.16 --> 2463.52
in the street and people like

2462.0 --> 2465.68
fire yeah

2463.52 --> 2469.04
burning buildings and [ __ ]

2465.68 --> 2469.04
yeah then you want to have a gun

2476.8 --> 2482.8
depends on ethics

2479.52 --> 2484.88
yeah no look if you're gonna be a looter

2482.8 --> 2488.5600000000004
pillager

2484.88 --> 2488.56
then i'm not even gonna give you advice

2489.68 --> 2492.72
yeah

2490.72 --> 2495.4399999999996
having no morality

2492.72 --> 2497.2
can get you short-term success and then

2495.44 --> 2499.52
everything gets worse and then you

2497.2 --> 2503.52
become the problem and then people will

2499.52 --> 2503.52
have guns because of you

2506.88 --> 2510.56
right yeah just the point fine

2513.68 --> 2518.0789999999997
all right guns can get you silver and

2515.52 --> 2520.56
food they can also get you killed if you

2518.079 --> 2523.3590000000004
think you can just take it

2520.56 --> 2525.2799999999997
because you got a gun not of my way okay

2523.359 --> 2527.839
that's good that's good

2525.28 --> 2527.8390000000004
no worries

2534.839 --> 2539.359
right

2536.8 --> 2541.92
so it's a two-tier security they're not

2539.359 --> 2545.04
on the same level right

2541.92 --> 2547.119
silver is great when the

2545.04 --> 2549.52
standard financial systems start to

2547.119 --> 2553.28
corrupt and break down

2549.52 --> 2556.079
and you need to be able to trade

2553.28 --> 2556.079
then it's great

2556.24 --> 2560.16
but if things really go to [ __ ] and

2558.4 --> 2563.6800000000003
there is no more trade

2560.16 --> 2565.2
it's all blocked or whatever

2563.68 --> 2568.56
cut off

2565.2 --> 2572.359
yeah yeah then a gun

2568.56 --> 2572.359
so it's it's two-tier

2583.92 --> 2588.079
gave you something to talk about yeah no

2585.599 --> 2590.88
that's great

2588.079 --> 2594.2400000000002
it's a good question

2590.88 --> 2594.2400000000002
thank you godzilla

2595.44 --> 2601.48
i like those you know

2597.28 --> 2601.48
good question is very valuable

2654.079 --> 2657.079
uh

2672.24 --> 2678.7999999999997
the sun's coming through again okay

2676.88 --> 2680.48
it's just the colors man that that's

2678.8 --> 2681.599
like the bonus you know it's like oh

2680.48 --> 2683.04
autumn

2681.599 --> 2685.92
so depressing

2683.04 --> 2689.2799999999997
oh yeah well what about the beautiful

2685.92 --> 2690.88
beautiful colors of the leaves

2689.28 --> 2693.3590000000004
especially when

2690.88 --> 2695.839
clear sun just hits them it's so

2693.359 --> 2695.839
beautiful

2699.04 --> 2702.96
and so interesting also that there are

2700.56 --> 2705.92
still just green leaves in between that

2702.96 --> 2707.44
so it's just this painting

2705.92 --> 2710.96
made by god

2707.44 --> 2710.96
made by the designer

2712.0 --> 2716.4
and now of course if you're

2713.92 --> 2718.16
feeling really sucky

2716.4 --> 2719.92
and unstable and you don't have

2718.16 --> 2721.68
attention yeah then you're not going to

2719.92 --> 2723.599
enjoy it as much

2721.68 --> 2725.04
perhaps after you had like a moment of

2723.599 --> 2726.6400000000003
stress relief

2725.04 --> 2728.24
crying or something and then you get a

2726.64 --> 2730.56
clear moment and then it's like oh my

2728.24 --> 2733.04
god it's so beautiful

2730.56 --> 2737.359
but yeah if you don't feel all stressed

2733.04 --> 2737.359
out constantly then it's just beautiful

2739.68 --> 2746.44
and i feel really good today so yeah to

2742.56 --> 2746.44
me it's just like wow

2749.44 --> 2752.88
because today i feel strong

2758.16 --> 2762.0789999999997
what

2759.44 --> 2764.0
there are girls on twitch just sitting

2762.079 --> 2765.04
in hot tubs

2764.0 --> 2768.92
chatting

2765.04 --> 2768.92
for hours that is

2779.2 --> 2783.64
did it talk about anything interesting

2792.079 --> 2798.52
i hope you're not talking about porn

2794.96 --> 2798.52
probably not

2811.52 --> 2814.72
not porn okay good

2813.119 --> 2817.52
i thought

2814.72 --> 2821.0
yeah

2817.52 --> 2821.0
twitch girls

2834.319 --> 2838.88
women of all ages

2836.079 --> 2839.76
okay so this it's a new trend hot tubs

2838.88 --> 2842.079
and then

2839.76 --> 2845.559
doing that or something

2842.079 --> 2845.559
okay whatever

2849.2 --> 2852.48
you got

2850.319 --> 2857.0
popular streamers to talk about flat

2852.48 --> 2857.0
earth oh really snowbirds who

2865.68 --> 2871.2
i'll stop the traffic arrest that like

2867.839 --> 2873.52
it could be kind of funny or interesting

2871.2 --> 2874.96
potentially not doesn't automatically

2873.52 --> 2877.04
become like that

2874.96 --> 2878.96
like streams where

2877.04 --> 2880.88
it would be women

2878.96 --> 2883.04
like perhaps of different ages like

2880.88 --> 2885.599
together in a hot tub

2883.04 --> 2887.359
talking about things

2885.599 --> 2890.4
and then

2887.359 --> 2890.4
on the live stream

2890.64 --> 2895.1189999999997
and maybe one of them also like dealing

2893.04 --> 2897.68
with the chat i don't know that could be

2895.119 --> 2897.6800000000003
interesting

2897.76 --> 2901.8390000000004
it all depends on what they're to talk

2899.359 --> 2901.839
about

2910.88 --> 2915.76
hello xgin

2913.44 --> 2918.4
what's the strangest thing you've seen

2915.76 --> 2918.4
in the sky

2919.68 --> 2925.0789999999997
the strangest thing i like with my own

2922.079 --> 2925.079
eyes

2928.4 --> 2931.359
have to dig back

2935.28 --> 2938.2400000000002
well this

2936.64 --> 2940.839
some things that have happened multiple

2938.24 --> 2943.7599999999998
times that i think are the most

2940.839 --> 2944.72
mysterious that i'm really weirded out

2943.76 --> 2945.92
by

2944.72 --> 2950.48
are

2945.92 --> 2950.48
like the micro meteorites

2951.68 --> 2955.5989999999997
like not a falling star like

2954.319 --> 2957.2
right

2955.599 --> 2958.559
which could be a purely light-based

2957.2 --> 2961.9199999999996
phenomenon

2958.559 --> 2963.76
but like when i yeah when it gets close

2961.92 --> 2965.76
when it actually

2963.76 --> 2968.079
becomes physical

2965.76 --> 2971.8390000000004
that's really weird to me and suddenly

2968.079 --> 2971.8390000000004
like i'm looking somewhere and it's like

2975.359 --> 2979.04
like this glittery thing coming like

2977.92 --> 2981.119
that

2979.04 --> 2983.68
and that happened multiple times but

2981.119 --> 2987.359
some of them like were so close by it's

2983.68 --> 2987.359
like wow that seems like it's

2987.76 --> 2992.6400000000003
maybe like 500 feet away

2990.559 --> 2994.2400000000002
and i'm like what

2992.64 --> 2996.24
what is that

2994.24 --> 2999.2799999999997
where did that come from

2996.24 --> 3002.0
and yeah and because of the

2999.28 --> 3004.48
clear proximity like it's not just

3002.0 --> 3006.4
another celestial weird thing it's not

3004.48 --> 3008.8
just some holographic light thing or

3006.4 --> 3011.119
potentially holographic right a lot of

3008.8 --> 3013.44
ufo sightings might be that

3011.119 --> 3014.96
falling stars the the typical ones are

3013.44 --> 3017.68
probably that

3014.96 --> 3019.52
but yeah i have situations where it's

3017.68 --> 3021.7599999999998
really different and there just seems to

3019.52 --> 3022.48
be some glittery thing

3021.76 --> 3024.8
that

3022.48 --> 3027.8
i would even be able to hear them

3024.8 --> 3027.8
crackle

3028.0 --> 3033.2
that's really i find that very bizarre

3035.04 --> 3038.88
northern lights

3037.04 --> 3041.839
i've never seen northern lights in

3038.88 --> 3041.839
person

3062.72 --> 3065.72
hmm

3071.04 --> 3075.04
nearly everyday pink purple skies in the

3073.359 --> 3078.16
evenings

3075.04 --> 3079.68
yeah well that does tend to happen

3078.16 --> 3082.24
during autumn

3079.68 --> 3084.64
right autumn skies

3082.24 --> 3086.0789999999997
if it's not just giant rain clouds and

3084.64 --> 3087.839
[ __ ]

3086.079 --> 3090.1600000000003
you get all kinds of interesting colors

3087.839 --> 3092.16
and i think that the sun is also kind of

3090.16 --> 3095.359
different like the type of light that

3092.16 --> 3097.68
comes off the sun during autumn

3095.359 --> 3101.839
and winter too

3097.68 --> 3101.839
is very different from summer light

3102.64 --> 3107.2
and it does seem to like

3105.2 --> 3109.839
just

3107.2 --> 3113.4399999999996
almost enhance the colors of things that

3109.839 --> 3113.44
it reflects on it's interesting

3119.359 --> 3123.64
so you get a lot of beautiful sights

3131.28 --> 3136.8
for the last two or three years all year

3134.0 --> 3136.8
round okay

3137.119 --> 3142.48
well i don't have a

3139.839 --> 3144.48
an explanation for that

3142.48 --> 3148.599
then again you are

3144.48 --> 3148.599
like in norway right

3155.119 --> 3159.079
or did i mix you up

3170.319 --> 3173.599
oh north canada sorry

3174.88 --> 3181.48
right but close to north right so yeah

3177.44 --> 3181.48
it works kind of different

3181.599 --> 3188.079
i'm really dead center moderate zone

3185.2 --> 3193.0
right in between

3188.079 --> 3193.0
the cold and the warmer regions

3196.4 --> 3201.44
you seen the aurora borealis in scotland

3200.319 --> 3202.88
oh

3201.44 --> 3204.319
okay that's

3202.88 --> 3206.079
unusually

3204.319 --> 3209.079
far south

3206.079 --> 3209.079
huh

3210.16 --> 3218.5989999999997
was it a super clear day

3213.359 --> 3218.5989999999997
or night that you were able to see that

3227.839 --> 3232.64
all right yeah see you later pj crew

3229.28 --> 3232.6400000000003
shanks thanks for popping by

3233.2 --> 3237.0789999999997
good luck on the new job

3241.92 --> 3246.16
right it was nice and really clear that

3243.599 --> 3246.1600000000003
makes sense

3246.559 --> 3251.3590000000004
right because it does like the

3248.64 --> 3254.24
phenomenon is not celestial the northern

3251.359 --> 3257.839
lights it does seem like an actual

3254.24 --> 3257.839
euclidean event

3258.319 --> 3260.96
it's not

3259.359 --> 3262.4
holographic

3260.96 --> 3264.8
so yeah you're gonna have to deal with

3262.4 --> 3266.559
the proximity and if you want to see

3264.8 --> 3269.44
that at great distance it will have to

3266.559 --> 3272.0
be very clear

3269.44 --> 3273.76
otherwise it's just going to

3272.0 --> 3276.48
yeah the line of sight is going to be

3273.76 --> 3280.4
less and then it won't be visible it

3276.48 --> 3283.44
will all be just cut off

3280.4 --> 3283.44
from the line of sight

3288.24 --> 3291.24
right

3316.079 --> 3320.4
oh dear godzilla

3319.2 --> 3322.3999999999996
to the dentist

3320.4 --> 3323.76
oh dear

3322.4 --> 3326.079
don't forget

3323.76 --> 3327.5200000000004
the magnesium

3326.079 --> 3331.6400000000003
if

3327.52 --> 3331.64
if you got something that hurts

3334.559 --> 3338.3190000000004
yeah good luck with that see you later

3343.359 --> 3347.5989999999997
all right clutch that would be cool i'll

3345.119 --> 3350.079
just delete it all right

3347.599 --> 3350.079
that's good

3353.599 --> 3360.2000000000003
don't swallow any fluoride pills not

3356.799 --> 3360.2
you know that

3367.52 --> 3370.48
hey logan's run

3374.16 --> 3379.96
oh should i just call you jason

3375.839 --> 3379.96
mccarmack i know it's you

3397.359 --> 3400.359
do

3406.079 --> 3413.0
i was joking

3409.28 --> 3413.0
what are you talking about

3434.24 --> 3438.72
okay

3436.079 --> 3441.119
well good for you because when i see

3438.72 --> 3444.3999999999996
that [ __ ]

3441.119 --> 3444.4
usually it's not a joke

3444.799 --> 3449.52
and uh jason mccormick is notorious for

3447.44 --> 3451.599
constantly

3449.52 --> 3453.599
making new sock accounts and then like

3451.599 --> 3456.0
some weirdo

3453.599 --> 3457.92
come out in the closet and copy paste

3456.0 --> 3461.359
the same crap again

3457.92 --> 3463.76
to like signal it's really me

3461.359 --> 3465.359
and yeah if somebody else as a joke

3463.76 --> 3467.2000000000003
starts doing that yeah what do you think

3465.359 --> 3469.7599999999998
is gonna happen i'm gonna think it's you

3467.2 --> 3471.68
it's you right

3469.76 --> 3474.48
because that's what he does

3471.68 --> 3477.44
so yeah don't don't joke about that

3474.48 --> 3477.44
it's really annoying

3487.839 --> 3492.319
oh so

3489.44 --> 3494.559
you're just gonna do it right now are

3492.319 --> 3494.5589999999997
you

3496.799 --> 3503.799
so what makes you think i'm not gonna

3498.88 --> 3503.799
ban you right now logan's run

3517.92 --> 3521.6800000000003
you got a minute to come up with a good

3519.68 --> 3524.24
excuse because

3521.68 --> 3527.3999999999996
if you don't i am going to ban you

3524.24 --> 3527.3999999999996
you understand

3531.04 --> 3535.359
please don't

3532.559 --> 3535.3590000000004
clown face

3537.04 --> 3543.599
all right it's last opportunity

3540.48 --> 3546.64
it's i don't find that joke funny

3543.599 --> 3546.6400000000003
yeah good removed

3553.119 --> 3558.319
joke around all you like in whatever

3555.599 --> 3560.4
discord forums or other live streams if

3558.319 --> 3562.88
you think that's funny i don't think

3560.4 --> 3562.88
it's funny

3567.359 --> 3573.68
i mean the guy has been nagging me with

3570.079 --> 3575.6800000000003
this cultish [ __ ] for years okay

3573.68 --> 3577.839
years

3575.68 --> 3579.9199999999996
where he would come in every freaking

3577.839 --> 3582.799
day in every chat

3579.92 --> 3584.96
i was a part of fed over here and

3582.799 --> 3586.559
constantly stalk me with that [ __ ] i

3584.96 --> 3588.799
don't think it's funny

3586.559 --> 3588.799
okay

3589.68 --> 3596.44
you don't have to go quiet just don't

3592.0 --> 3596.44
do that and you'll be okay

3601.92 --> 3606.839
you didn't know that okay well now you

3603.839 --> 3606.839
know

3619.359 --> 3624.5589999999997
don't pay attention you're falling for

3621.76 --> 3624.559
it no i'm just

3626.319 --> 3631.92
it's just i don't like that

3628.96 --> 3634.7200000000003
it's really annoying the guy has never

3631.92 --> 3637.44
ever given me a single technical

3634.72 --> 3640.72
argument for his cult belief ever

3637.44 --> 3643.92
i mean peachey has given me more and

3640.72 --> 3648.0789999999997
better explanations for his ideas

3643.92 --> 3650.88
than jason mccormack okay and that's

3648.079 --> 3653.44
well you know pj

3650.88 --> 3656.88
doesn't really give a lot of very solid

3653.44 --> 3659.2000000000003
argumentation when you really push him

3656.88 --> 3661.839
on that so

3659.2 --> 3664.3999999999996
just goes to show no the guy is just

3661.839 --> 3666.799
just blabbers and he doesn't know what

3664.4 --> 3668.799
the hell he's saying

3666.799 --> 3671.68
and that pisses me off

3668.799 --> 3674.079
right i'll discuss things sure i do

3671.68 --> 3676.16
but i'm not gonna just tolerate somebody

3674.079 --> 3678.6400000000003
chanting something that they don't even

3676.16 --> 3678.64
understand

3681.599 --> 3686.7200000000003
give us your message yeah well that's

3683.52 --> 3689.7599999999998
that is my message all right

3686.72 --> 3691.68
go nut man it is my message

3689.76 --> 3694.2400000000002
right i deal with that sort of thing i

3691.68 --> 3696.8799999999997
deal with people's psychology

3694.24 --> 3698.9599999999996
i analyze them i point out what the

3696.88 --> 3701.6800000000003
problem is i point out what my personal

3698.96 --> 3703.52
objections are i clear things up it's

3701.68 --> 3705.52
not wasting my time it's called

3703.52 --> 3706.64
clarification

3705.52 --> 3708.079
right

3706.64 --> 3709.5989999999997
you can't just say

3708.079 --> 3712.799
don't do this

3709.599 --> 3715.599
and then not explain why because then

3712.799 --> 3716.4
you're kind of demanding that people

3715.599 --> 3719.599
just

3716.4 --> 3720.88
blindly trust you or something

3719.599 --> 3723.44
now when i

3720.88 --> 3726.079
have an idea about something and i

3723.44 --> 3728.7200000000003
don't understand it myself fully and

3726.079 --> 3731.3590000000004
it's like a bit still with mysterious

3728.72 --> 3732.799
then i just can't really explain it

3731.359 --> 3734.72
purely

3732.799 --> 3736.88
fully

3734.72 --> 3739.4399999999996
we're talking about other people and

3736.88 --> 3741.359
interactions yeah i can and i will it's

3739.44 --> 3743.68
not a waste of my time it's part of what

3741.359 --> 3743.68
i do

3746.88 --> 3750.559
green fireballs what

3752.24 --> 3755.5589999999997
that's weird

3792.559 --> 3798.079
wow

3793.599 --> 3798.079
okay that is very unusual xgen

3799.119 --> 3804.48
well maybe

3801.599 --> 3806.559
it is like a well a physical glittering

3804.48 --> 3808.96
type of

3806.559 --> 3812.6400000000003
meteor as it would now be called that

3808.96 --> 3812.64
you saw as well except it had

3813.68 --> 3818.3999999999996
material in it that would make it light

3815.92 --> 3818.4
up green

3820.559 --> 3825.119
i've never seen that

3822.839 --> 3827.119
every glittery

3825.119 --> 3829.119
close by falling star that i've ever

3827.119 --> 3832.079
seen

3829.119 --> 3836.88
would always just be very intense pure

3832.079 --> 3839.8390000000004
white light like magne or manganese

3836.88 --> 3839.839
what's it called

3846.24 --> 3852.5589999999997
like it is magnesium by the way right so

3848.72 --> 3855.7599999999998
it's like a magnesium super white flame

3852.559 --> 3858.7200000000003
like blinding perfect white

3855.76 --> 3861.5200000000004
maybe it's like slightly bluish but it's

3858.72 --> 3866.1189999999997
very slight

3861.52 --> 3866.119
it's mostly just really intense white

3890.64 --> 3894.48
could be the same

3892.48 --> 3896.559
what george sanford

3894.48 --> 3898.4
are you saying meteors

3896.559 --> 3900.4
come from northern light i don't think

3898.4 --> 3903.839
there's a relation

3900.4 --> 3903.839
that's a very odd idea

3903.92 --> 3907.039
like how would that happen

3907.52 --> 3909.839
like

3910.079 --> 3913.76
i mean i could on the fly fantasize

3912.88 --> 3915.76
about

3913.76 --> 3917.8390000000004
how that could work but that seems

3915.76 --> 3918.96
extremely unlikely

3917.839 --> 3920.839
like

3918.96 --> 3925.839
the northern lights are

3920.839 --> 3925.839
magnetic obviously so maybe there's like

3926.72 --> 3931.839
pieces that for some reason shoot up

3929.599 --> 3934.0
from maybe the meteors all come from the

3931.839 --> 3937.44
northern magnetic pole and they just

3934.0 --> 3940.64
shoot away sometimes inexplicably like

3937.44 --> 3942.96
they're being magnetically launched

3940.64 --> 3946.24
and then they end up

3942.96 --> 3948.48
eventually falling down

3946.24 --> 3950.3999999999996
in the rest of the realm

3948.48 --> 3952.88
burning up for some reason to know that

3950.4 --> 3955.28
seems so unlikely it's

3952.88 --> 3958.48
ridiculous

3955.28 --> 3960.3190000000004
i don't see any relation really

3958.48 --> 3964.839
i don't know where yeah where they come

3960.319 --> 3964.839
from how that is even possible

3967.119 --> 3971.839
i know i've put down an idea in an early

3970.079 --> 3973.599
bird show like a couple of hundred

3971.839 --> 3975.7599999999998
episodes ago

3973.599 --> 3978.2400000000002
about like who could they

3975.76 --> 3979.2000000000003
be forming somewhere up there out of

3978.24 --> 3983.2799999999997
like

3979.2 --> 3983.2799999999997
transmuting helium or something

3984.72 --> 3987.9199999999996
but yeah i can't really

3990.64 --> 3994.4
give any serious elaboration on how that

3993.039 --> 3996.96
would happen

3994.4 --> 3999.359
other than what i did in the show

3996.96 --> 3999.359
back then

4002.799 --> 4008.48
i got a lot of flack ridicule flack from

4005.2 --> 4012.319
ballers for that oh irwin thinks me

4050.96 --> 4054.4
bad

4052.0 --> 4056.4
pushback from it from the guys that

annoyed me but yeah did you see the

4056.4 --> 4062.48
stream later with the jaren and david

4058.96 --> 4063.76

it totally proved my point

4068.64 --> 4075.96
i'm really happy that david and jaren

4071.119 --> 4075.96
were like on the same level about that

4096.4 --> 4102.44
hydrogen matey

4099.199 --> 4102.44
yeah perhaps

4104.0 --> 4108.0

4122.08 --> 4127.679
it was very satisfactory

4125.12 --> 4129.599999999999
like it made me very happy that i did

4127.679 --> 4133.319
what i did

4129.6 --> 4133.319
earlier that day

4134.64 --> 4139.279
that they didn't try to like make

4136.48 --> 4140.879999999999
excuses for him or anything like no it's

4139.279 --> 4142.799000000001

4188.799 --> 4192.319
the beginning again like to the end like

4200.239 --> 4205.44
with rv on there and dave weiss

4203.6 --> 4208.56
and it was like a lot of bickering

4205.44 --> 4210.719
because rv was just rumpusing the [ __ ]

4208.56 --> 4213.52
especially out of david like he didn't

4210.719 --> 4216.08
want david to finish a single sentence

4213.52 --> 4219.679
it was almost like

4216.08 --> 4219.679
a nathan oakley situation

4220.32 --> 4223.759999999999
with the fundy just constantly

4221.84 --> 4226.719
interrupting everything

4223.76 --> 4231.84
it was embarrassing for rv a lot

4226.719 --> 4231.84
like he made a real ass of himself there

4237.84 --> 4242.400000000001

4268.4 --> 4272.5199999999995
what you'll find out

4278.8 --> 4285.88
they are they all getting addicted to

4281.52 --> 4285.88
theater what do you mean

4302.96 --> 4305.96
so

4328.56 --> 4332.88
i don't understand the relation to what

4331.04 --> 4335.679
you said before that

4332.88 --> 4335.679
gum nut man

4337.199 --> 4343.839999999999
are you just referencing to

4339.92 --> 4343.84
the gerund stream that i linked up to

4348.4 --> 4352.799999999999
yeah alsg yeah no [ __ ] yeah wrong

4350.48 --> 4354.08
pursuing him absolutely like david's

4352.8 --> 4356.56
talking

4354.08 --> 4358.08
and either halfway or just after a few

4356.56 --> 4360.080000000001
seconds just

4358.08 --> 4363.199
just jitter like stuttering like a

4360.08 --> 4365.36
stuttering [ __ ] just talk over it

4363.199 --> 4367.678999999999

4374.08 --> 4378.96
david this absolutely

4376.8 --> 4381.28
justified

4378.96 --> 4385.12
it was so annoying

4381.28 --> 4386.239
that video was removed what

4385.12 --> 4388.239
oh right

4386.239 --> 4389.5199999999995
oh that's true that's true sorry about

4388.239 --> 4391.599999999999
that uh

4389.52 --> 4394.159000000001
yeah jaron said he would remove it and

4391.6 --> 4398.52
put it on rockfin

4394.159 --> 4398.5199999999995
i'll just find the rockfin video

4403.36 --> 4406.36
uh

4413.84 --> 4416.159000000001
all right

4417.84 --> 4421.360000000001
this is this should be the

4419.679 --> 4424.159
four hour stream yeah yeah yeah yeah

4421.36 --> 4427.159
right okay here is it sorry about the

4424.159 --> 4427.159
the

4428.64 --> 4434.2390000000005
the wrong link here's the here's the

4431.36 --> 4436.96
the rock fin link to the stream i wanted

4434.239 --> 4436.959999999999
to link up to

4437.92 --> 4441.159
it's there

4441.92 --> 4447.8
thanks for telling me by the way i

4443.44 --> 4447.799999999999
wouldn't have known unless you said that

4525.12 --> 4528.0
wait what clutch

4528.239 --> 4533.199
i love when peeps drop a one line

4534.32 --> 4538.48
like they jesus

4536.719 --> 4541.04
and we should be amazed at their

4538.48 --> 4541.04
statement

4542.8 --> 4547.6
right

4544.96 --> 4549.92
well it's like

4547.6 --> 4550.96
dropping a one line like i kind of do

4549.92 --> 4553.6
that

4550.96 --> 4555.44
but i always

4553.6 --> 4559.280000000001
like

4555.44 --> 4561.678999999999
i i share my ideas and even like

4559.28 --> 4564.8
present little puzzles

4561.679 --> 4566.64
but it's always meant to be figured out

4564.8 --> 4568.159000000001
right it's meant to be understood what i

4566.64 --> 4571.1990000000005
say not to be

4568.159 --> 4574.32
blindly accepted like you have to echo

4571.199 --> 4579.0
this without understanding i'd never do

4574.32 --> 4579.0
that i always avoid that [ __ ]

4580.08 --> 4585.36
when i say something

4582.56 --> 4586.96
i will be able to explain it

4585.36 --> 4589.5199999999995
because otherwise i won't bring it up

4586.96 --> 4591.52
i'm not just gonna put out like

4589.52 --> 4594.080000000001
statements and you're gonna have to just

4591.52 --> 4597.52
take it as it is without explanation

4594.08 --> 4597.5199999999995
that's unacceptable to me

4600.719 --> 4605.679
yeah he was acting like a 30 year old

4602.88 --> 4607.4400000000005
absolutely was arrested

4605.679 --> 4608.4
it's just stuttering like a funny

4607.44 --> 4610.719
[ __ ]

4608.4 --> 4615.799999999999
as nathan would call it

4610.719 --> 4615.8
if rv would done do that to him

4631.199 --> 4634.199
one

4649.76 --> 4655.12
that's an interesting point by the way

4651.36 --> 4656.32
yes the ascension is heavy

4655.12 --> 4660.32
it's like

4656.32 --> 4662.159
not the deceivers but even god himself

4660.32 --> 4666.159
is pulling away the curtain and

4662.159 --> 4666.159
basically blinding everyone

4666.48 --> 4672.879999999999
with availability

4669.44 --> 4674.32
like you can see it now but that doesn't

4672.88 --> 4677.04
mean that the weight

4674.32 --> 4678.4
of it and the inside and the ascension

4677.04 --> 4680.719
is going to be less right so that

4678.4 --> 4683.759999999999
doesn't mean just because you can get

4680.719 --> 4685.28
very far to the into the truth about

4683.76 --> 4688.320000000001
things

4685.28 --> 4691.04
onto surreal levels

4688.32 --> 4693.5199999999995
doesn't mean that you also automatically

4691.04 --> 4694.88
will be able to handle all that truth

4693.52 --> 4697.6
and that is really the biggest

4694.88 --> 4700.96
complication of the ascension process of

4697.6 --> 4700.96
the thing that's happening right now

4701.92 --> 4704.92
what

4706.239 --> 4714.959999999999
if i give a super quick quick

4710.32 --> 4714.96
rundown of your version of what

4716.56 --> 4718.96
dad

4719.44 --> 4723.28
no

4720.4 --> 4724.08
that's what

4723.28 --> 4726.719
what

4724.08 --> 4726.719
what do you mean

4733.28 --> 4737.84
my version of christ well i think he was

4735.44 --> 4738.879999999999
a man and i think he was the best of us

4737.84 --> 4742.159000000001
that's

4738.88 --> 4742.159000000001
that's the thing that i say

4742.56 --> 4747.120000000001
i think that he ushered in an

4745.04 --> 4749.5199999999995
unbelievable

4747.12 --> 4754.0
level of enlightenment for that age

4749.52 --> 4754.0
probably single-handedly broke through

4754.239 --> 4760.718999999999
a period where

4756.719 --> 4763.84
earthly darkness was absolutely normal

4760.719 --> 4763.84
and he basically

4764.239 --> 4768.08
broke up a glow stick and suddenly there

4766.88 --> 4770.4800000000005
was light

4768.08 --> 4772.64
in the spirit

4770.48 --> 4774.32
for people

4772.64 --> 4777.12
right that's

4774.32 --> 4778.96
kind of how i see christ he was the

4777.12 --> 4781.28
coming of the light

4778.96 --> 4784.719
in a time of darkness

4781.28 --> 4786.159
and he broke with convention

4784.719 --> 4788.56
a lot

4786.159 --> 4791.12
right and it's like the entire christian

4788.56 --> 4795.04
priest religion has been trying to

4791.12 --> 4795.04
justify all of that

4795.199 --> 4800.4
almost like encapsulated

4798.4 --> 4803.36
but he broke

4800.4 --> 4806.08
he basically like the statement of like

4803.36 --> 4808.0
that's not my father

4806.08 --> 4811.04
is profound

4808.0 --> 4813.199
it's really big has big implications

4811.04 --> 4816.0
that a lot of christians kind of like

4813.199 --> 4818.638999999999
they don't seem to get that

4816.0 --> 4820.88
and that's why i said

4818.639 --> 4822.400000000001
like yesterday even

4820.88 --> 4823.679
was it yesterday was the day before i

4822.4 --> 4826.4
don't remember

4823.679 --> 4828.4
like in a way jesus was like

4826.4 --> 4832.239
as tough

4828.4 --> 4833.92
was like the satanist of his time

4832.239 --> 4836.08
because

4833.92 --> 4839.679
not talking about

4836.08 --> 4841.6
how it currently is seen not modern but

4839.679 --> 4843.76
he was the opposer

4841.6 --> 4847.76
he was the opposer to

4843.76 --> 4849.6
how things were normal back then

4847.76 --> 4854.0
and he broke that

4849.6 --> 4854.0
he said like no no more sacrifices

4854.719 --> 4858.96
the sacrifice must be

4857.199 --> 4861.839999999999
personal

4858.96 --> 4861.84
like

4862.639 --> 4866.719
resist temptations

4865.679 --> 4869.36
and

4866.719 --> 4873.04
deepen that more

4869.36 --> 4875.599999999999
personal spiritual sacrifice but for the

4873.04 --> 4878.08
good not not just like laying down your

4875.6 --> 4880.639
faculties at all exactly the opposite

4878.08 --> 4882.719
really so it was a revolutionary of his

4880.639 --> 4885.679
time

4882.719 --> 4887.12
but very dangerous because he literally

4885.679 --> 4889.12
opposed

4887.12 --> 4891.199
all the

4889.12 --> 4894.0
the wielding of

4891.199 --> 4896.08
priesthood and god system that was there

4894.0 --> 4897.199
in that time

4896.08 --> 4900.84
he was a

4897.199 --> 4900.839999999999
spiritual revolutionary

4909.12 --> 4914.48
and yeah and then later it was

4912.0 --> 4917.36
diaphide they literally turned him into

4914.48 --> 4918.48
a deity within christianity and just

4917.36 --> 4920.719
kind of

4918.48 --> 4924.08
reintegrated

4920.719 --> 4928.0
his legacy and it is incompatible again

4924.08 --> 4930.5599999999995
with the old old religion normalization

4928.0 --> 4933.36
they reintegrate like they encapsulated

4930.56 --> 4935.360000000001
it and i've explained it like that a

4933.36 --> 4936.88
year ago

4935.36 --> 4939.5199999999995
it's like the

4936.88 --> 4942.159000000001
catholic church and the vatican are like

4939.52 --> 4944.639
encapsulated

4942.159 --> 4947.199
like captured christ

4944.639 --> 4948.56
christ's legacy

4947.199 --> 4951.28
but they

4948.56 --> 4955.1990000000005
in a way almost conceal his light

4951.28 --> 4957.44
because the things that are acted upon

4955.199 --> 4960.08
can yeah if you cross reference it with

4957.44 --> 4962.08
jesus the esoterics of his teachings

4960.08 --> 4964.239
then you'll find like that does that's

4962.08 --> 4966.08
totally conflicting

4964.239 --> 4969.04
that's conflicting with what jesus

4966.08 --> 4971.4
actually recommended and what he taught

4969.04 --> 4974.32
so they they basically magically

4971.4 --> 4976.5599999999995
encapsulated his wisdom

4974.32 --> 4979.599999999999
and they don't really

4976.56 --> 4979.6
unify with it

4982.48 --> 4986.199
it's very complicated

4986.4 --> 4990.32
but at the same time when you see it

4988.239 --> 4994.44
when you feel it it's very direct very

4990.32 --> 4994.44
straightforward in a way

5003.76 --> 5007.1990000000005
if i had a time machine visiting jesus

5005.84 --> 5009.84
would be at the top of the list well

5007.199 --> 5011.678999999999
that's going to be difficult ex-gen

5009.84 --> 5012.84
because

5011.679 --> 5015.4400000000005
the way

5012.84 --> 5017.76
jesus is

5015.44 --> 5020.0
written about in the bible

5017.76 --> 5022.320000000001
is very unlikely to have been the

5020.0 --> 5025.12
original person

5022.32 --> 5026.88
that was actually jesus

5025.12 --> 5029.84
so yeah you're going to have to find him

5026.88 --> 5029.84
first

5032.8 --> 5036.76
if you had a time machine

5045.679 --> 5051.76
right but it would be amazing to really

5048.32 --> 5051.759999999999
hear the original words

5052.239 --> 5055.5199999999995
from the actual person

5054.239 --> 5057.599999999999
that

5055.52 --> 5060.96
out which they came

5057.6 --> 5060.96
that would be amazing i agree

5062.639 --> 5065.679
right you mean the actual person well

5064.08 --> 5068.88
like you step in a time machine you're

5065.679 --> 5072.08
like okay i'm gonna go to bethlehem

5068.88 --> 5073.76
this era well

5072.08 --> 5075.36
you might be able like

5073.76 --> 5077.280000000001
let's say the time machine works you go

5075.36 --> 5079.5199999999995
there well

5077.28 --> 5081.28
you might find somebody that sort of

5079.52 --> 5083.52
correlates but it

5081.28 --> 5085.04
he's not like the jesus of the bible at

5083.52 --> 5085.84
all

5085.04 --> 5087.6
right

5085.84 --> 5091.360000000001
doesn't mean he doesn't exist it just

5087.6 --> 5091.360000000001
means like yeah that's kind of the

5091.84 --> 5096.84
they grafted

5093.6 --> 5100.4800000000005
another person into the

5096.84 --> 5102.96
character but the original wisdom from

5100.48 --> 5106.159
jesus did come from a real person

5102.96 --> 5108.159
probably a singular person

5106.159 --> 5109.839999999999
and he might have been like egyptian or

5108.159 --> 5111.92
something

5109.84 --> 5113.52
it's complicated i don't have a full

5111.92 --> 5114.96
oversight

5113.52 --> 5116.88
but he was

5114.96 --> 5120.719
probably

5116.88 --> 5120.719
decently wealthy as well

5121.12 --> 5124.5599999999995
it was not

5122.639 --> 5126.56
like that poor

5124.56 --> 5128.96
he was healthy

5126.56 --> 5131.360000000001
he had pretty good clothes

5128.96 --> 5134.32
clothes but he was very

5131.36 --> 5136.08
all about like yeah money corrupts it's

5134.32 --> 5137.599999999999
dangerous

5136.08 --> 5140.4
don't indulge

5137.6 --> 5142.159000000001
he had a lot of wisdom concerning

5140.4 --> 5144.0
wealth

5142.159 --> 5147.759999999999
well how would you get that if you've

5144.0 --> 5147.76
always been poor you see

5148.08 --> 5155.04
this is already kind of an intrical

5151.36 --> 5157.12
thing if you think about it like how

5155.04 --> 5159.84
would somebody that's lived only a poor

5157.12 --> 5162.96
life ever have a clear understanding of

5159.84 --> 5162.96
the corruption of money

5167.52 --> 5172.4800000000005
he was probably wealthy and he just knew

5170.08 --> 5174.639
like everybody around him was constantly

5172.48 --> 5176.48
dealing with the corruption of it and he

5174.639 --> 5177.84
defended against it even though he had

5176.48 --> 5181.599999999999
the wealth

5177.84 --> 5184.32
so that the wealth wouldn't possess him

5181.6 --> 5184.320000000001
fascinating

5189.04 --> 5194.08
yeah i'm having some really interesting

5190.88 --> 5197.04
conversations with adamikin recently

5194.08 --> 5200.159
like he's digging deep and he has much

5197.04 --> 5201.04
more oversight in all that than me like

5200.159 --> 5203.599999999999
like

5201.04 --> 5205.76
almost historical level quality i don't

5203.6 --> 5208.0
have that kind of oversight i'm much

5205.76 --> 5208.0
more

5208.639 --> 5211.639
intuitive

5219.52 --> 5222.52
hmm

5225.44 --> 5228.44
um

5238.159 --> 5242.08
wouldn't go back with any assumptions

5239.76 --> 5244.8
right what will be exploration like what

5242.08 --> 5244.8
really happened

5247.36 --> 5252.719
right and then if you haven't done deep

5250.239 --> 5254.5599999999995
research you'll probably end up there

5252.719 --> 5256.32
all assuming that you actually would

5254.56 --> 5257.84
have a time machine that will work you

5256.32 --> 5259.599999999999
would end up there like

5257.84 --> 5261.84
holy [ __ ]

5259.6 --> 5264.159000000001
like it's completely different from

5261.84 --> 5266.400000000001
everything i expected

5264.159 --> 5268.32
like everything is completely different

5266.4 --> 5270.08
like the technology might even be

5268.32 --> 5272.88
different that was being used back then

5270.08 --> 5274.5599999999995
and just the way things were done

5272.88 --> 5276.88
so different from what we're used to

5274.56 --> 5278.96
right now all that and just like oh we

5276.88 --> 5281.36
got this story we always say oh this is

5278.96 --> 5284.08
how it happened and then like nothing

5281.36 --> 5286.159
about that actually reflects when you go

5284.08 --> 5289.44
back at all

5286.159 --> 5291.839999999999
it's all like composed of different

5289.44 --> 5296.5599999999995
stories

5291.84 --> 5298.96
but jesus's words they're real

5296.56 --> 5301.6
they have to be real

5298.96 --> 5304.32
i can feel it

5301.6 --> 5307.719
it's it's too cohesive

5304.32 --> 5307.719
too consistent

5313.199 --> 5318.638999999999
and also transplaceable it's like easy

5316.0 --> 5320.56
to graft that sort of message

5318.639 --> 5321.52
from one situation

5320.56 --> 5324.56
onto

5321.52 --> 5326.2390000000005
a character in the story see

5324.56 --> 5330.159000000001
jesus's wisdom

5326.239 --> 5333.36
is very transplantable story-wise

5330.159 --> 5333.36
yeah think about it

5333.679 --> 5339.6
because we can transplant wisdom

5337.76 --> 5343.4400000000005
in plays

5339.6 --> 5343.4400000000005
in stories in movies

5344.32 --> 5349.04
you graphed a piece of wisdom that

5346.239 --> 5350.638999999999
applied to a scenario

5349.04 --> 5352.0
and then you apply it to another

5350.639 --> 5353.4400000000005
scenario

5352.0 --> 5355.44
and it just fits

5353.44 --> 5359.04
because it's true it doesn't really

5355.44 --> 5362.0
matter where the wisdom in a story is

5359.04 --> 5365.159
if it if it applies it applies

5362.0 --> 5365.159
you see

5367.04 --> 5370.8
yeah wisdom transplant

5371.679 --> 5377.0
that's that would be a weird title for

5373.84 --> 5377.0
the show

5379.84 --> 5382.96
no i'm not going to call it this

5381.6 --> 5385.1990000000005
anyway

5382.96 --> 5385.199
right

5391.52 --> 5396.400000000001
how's g that's hilarious

5394.159 --> 5399.28
that is that is funniest

5396.4 --> 5400.879999999999
yeah you know what

5399.28 --> 5402.0
grandmother says boy supposed to have

5400.88 --> 5404.159000000001
short hair

5402.0 --> 5408.56
then you point at the statue of jesus

5404.159 --> 5408.5599999999995
behind her yeah yeah that's really funny

5410.56 --> 5413.92
but that's really like a cultural force

5412.48 --> 5417.04
of habit though right she probably

5413.92 --> 5419.679
hadn't even thought of that

5417.04 --> 5421.12
it's just like no in my time that's how

5419.679 --> 5423.1990000000005
we're supposed to like yeah bush

5421.12 --> 5425.04
supposed to have short hair so she's

5423.199 --> 5427.36
just called

5425.04 --> 5429.679
holding on to the cultural habit of the

5427.36 --> 5429.679
era

5430.0 --> 5433.0
right

5436.159 --> 5440.36
anyway i'll be back in two minutes

5459.28 --> 5462.28
what

5529.84 --> 5537.12
yeah you're out [ __ ] you logan's run

5535.04 --> 5540.48
you are jason mccormack and you're also

5537.12 --> 5542.639
a filthy sociopath lying scumbag a very

5540.48 --> 5545.599999999999
creepy guy

5542.639 --> 5547.92
like mental mentally flexible in ways a

5545.6 --> 5550.56
person shouldn't be

5547.92 --> 5550.56
you're sick

5552.0 --> 5554.639
and banned

5556.32 --> 5561.639
with your jokes thought i didn't see

5558.32 --> 5561.639
that scumbag

5580.88 --> 5584.159000000001
you don't believe so okay

5585.199 --> 5588.199
what

5589.199 --> 5594.04
all right that was in response to george

5591.04 --> 5594.04
sanford

5617.12 --> 5620.32
right yeah

5618.08 --> 5622.159
yeah well george sanford

5620.32 --> 5625.04
caucasian long hair

5622.159 --> 5628.839999999999
well how do you know what he was like

5625.04 --> 5631.28
i mean what if he was actually

5628.84 --> 5634.159000000001
egyptian there's some pretty pale

5631.28 --> 5634.159
egyptians there

5634.48 --> 5642.599999999999
so maybe he actually was like that

5639.12 --> 5642.599999999999
maybe he was

5648.8 --> 5654.0
that's the nice version to make him seem

5651.04 --> 5654.0
more relatable

5656.56 --> 5660.080000000001
really

5657.52 --> 5662.639
so are you saying that jesus in other

5660.08 --> 5665.199
countries because hey the christianity

5662.639 --> 5667.4400000000005
is spread pretty far

5665.199 --> 5669.36
and fragmented people do it in their own

5667.44 --> 5673.839999999999
are you saying that other statues of him

5669.36 --> 5673.839999999999
are different colors of skin

5674.159 --> 5677.12
in other regions

5679.679 --> 5684.36
i'm asking because i don't know for sure

5712.4 --> 5715.4
so

5724.159 --> 5727.159
so

5740.08 --> 5742.5599999999995
or you could just not answer the

5741.679 --> 5744.4800000000005
question

5742.56 --> 5747.280000000001
do something else right in the middle of

5744.48 --> 5747.28
the conversation

5751.76 --> 5755.1990000000005
it's logical for other cultures to

5753.84 --> 5757.84
portray them in

5755.199 --> 5760.0
their own way but do they

5757.84 --> 5763.360000000001
do they action that's the question do

5760.0 --> 5763.36
they actually do that

5763.92 --> 5769.28
or is he typically shown as that white

5767.119 --> 5771.759999999999
guy with long hair

5769.28 --> 5775.84
even in countries where that is not the

5771.76 --> 5778.4800000000005
typical average person i'm asking you

5775.84 --> 5782.4400000000005
not whether it seems logical but whether

5778.48 --> 5782.44
it is actually true

5790.8 --> 5797.360000000001
like the only type of weird color thing

5795.04 --> 5799.199
with icons from christianity that i've

5797.36 --> 5802.799999999999
seen that were like

5799.199 --> 5805.199
well not off but just like that that

5802.8 --> 5806.2390000000005
grabs my attention it's like the black

5805.199 --> 5807.599999999999
mary

5806.239 --> 5810.839999999999
like the

5807.6 --> 5814.4800000000005
prolifically black like

5810.84 --> 5816.88
hmm and it's supposed to be black that

5814.48 --> 5818.799999999999
was it madonna or what is it sorry black

5816.88 --> 5821.6
mary black madonna i think it was a

5818.8 --> 5823.04
black madonna sorry i'm mixing it up

5821.6 --> 5824.320000000001
but that stood out to me like whoa

5823.04 --> 5825.36
that's

5824.32 --> 5827.44
like

5825.36 --> 5829.28
very

5827.44 --> 5831.919999999999
like outspoken

5829.28 --> 5834.32
but i've never really seen like a jesus

5831.92 --> 5837.639
statue where he wasn't just well that

5834.32 --> 5837.639
white guy

5843.28 --> 5848.0
so that's why i'm asking like does

5845.6 --> 5852.400000000001
anybody has anybody ever seen like a

5848.0 --> 5855.52
jesus statue in like india or

5852.4 --> 5856.719
who knows where like japan

5855.52 --> 5857.76
well i've done that they are kind of

5856.719 --> 5860.08
white too

5857.76 --> 5860.08
uh

5860.239 --> 5864.0
in africa

5861.76 --> 5867.360000000001
the arabian

5864.0 --> 5869.92
places south america whatever like

5867.36 --> 5872.48
regions where there's definitely

5869.92 --> 5874.56
other colored people than just white

5872.48 --> 5876.959999999999
skin

5874.56 --> 5879.84
do they

5876.96 --> 5882.08
have like adaptation of the skin color

5879.84 --> 5884.400000000001
of jesus statues

5882.08 --> 5886.8
in those regions or do they just have

5884.4 --> 5889.599999999999
the white guy it's a question

5886.8 --> 5893.0
i'm asking you

5889.6 --> 5893.0
all of you

5897.199 --> 5902.199
original sin what that's [ __ ]

5928.0 --> 5932.159
okay well dude if nobody else is gonna

5930.08 --> 5934.48
do it i'm just gonna do it

5932.159 --> 5936.839999999999
just gonna

5934.48 --> 5940.759999999999
google

5936.84 --> 5940.76
jesus statues

5945.28 --> 5949.28
let's see what

5946.88 --> 5951.76
what comes up

5949.28 --> 5955.119
white statues why it's a

5951.76 --> 5955.119000000001
lots of white statues

5955.199 --> 5959.199
oh there's a black jesus it's in detroit

5958.0 --> 5960.88
okay

5959.199 --> 5963.199
if it's in america that doesn't count

5960.88 --> 5964.96
because that's all

5963.199 --> 5967.44
modern weird [ __ ]

5964.96 --> 5970.4
i'm talking about old

5967.44 --> 5972.638999999999
christian statues in like churches and

5970.4 --> 5972.638999999999
such

5974.239 --> 5980.199
oh right here's a list of unusual

5976.56 --> 5980.1990000000005
statues of jesus

5982.88 --> 5989.6
oh god [ __ ] off

5986.96 --> 5991.36
stupid ads

5989.6 --> 5992.84
i mean

5991.36 --> 5995.119
whatever

5992.84 --> 5997.28
right like jesus

5995.119 --> 6000.48
detroit there's a black jesus statue in

5997.28 --> 6002.239
detroit with white hair by the way

6000.48 --> 6005.28
that is odd

6002.239 --> 6005.28
looks like a drow

6005.679 --> 6008.679
uh

6014.8 --> 6020.52
anything else

6017.52 --> 6020.52
what

6027.28 --> 6034.159
uh

6029.6 --> 6034.159000000001
homeless jesus statue

6034.48 --> 6040.0
at the jesuit college in toronto what

6037.6 --> 6043.119000000001
the [ __ ]

6040.0 --> 6045.76
this is all blasphemy [ __ ] on purpose

6043.119 --> 6048.759999999999
oh let's get artsy

6045.76 --> 6048.76
right

6062.0 --> 6066.159
oh there's apparently an underwater

6063.92 --> 6067.92
statue of jesus

6066.159 --> 6071.36
which was meant to be underwater

6067.92 --> 6073.6
somewhere in italy that's interesting

6071.36 --> 6076.0
uh

6073.6 --> 6076.0
right

6077.28 --> 6082.4
okay so no that's

6080.239 --> 6084.959999999999
it doesn't seem to be a thing

6082.4 --> 6089.199
really just this freaking weird black

6084.96 --> 6089.199
jesus statue in detroit apparently

6089.52 --> 6096.8
but yeah in the general images

6093.84 --> 6096.8
no black jesus

6097.28 --> 6102.0
and that like includes places like

6099.36 --> 6105.159
brazil and

6102.0 --> 6105.159
and others

6108.0 --> 6112.719
let me

6109.199 --> 6115.36
specifically google black jesus

6112.719 --> 6119.88
let's see if anything else other than

6115.36 --> 6119.88
the detroit statue comes up

6127.679 --> 6131.119
all right

6129.36 --> 6134.119
there seem to be

6131.119 --> 6134.119
some

6135.679 --> 6138.2390000000005
where's that

6138.56 --> 6140.88
wow

6146.639 --> 6150.400000000001
where's where's puerto bello

6150.56 --> 6153.1990000000005
where is that

6155.28 --> 6158.28
panama

6162.639 --> 6168.719
yeah panama okay there is a black jesus

6165.44 --> 6168.719
statue in panama

6169.52 --> 6172.84
where's this

6178.239 --> 6182.159
all this scarf statue in europe

6180.719 --> 6184.719
but that's wood

6182.159 --> 6186.96
it's made of wood

6184.719 --> 6186.96
like

6188.239 --> 6193.48
right it's just the one kind of one

6190.48 --> 6193.48
color

6205.84 --> 6208.4800000000005
where is that

6215.92 --> 6220.32
ah i think this is also in italy

6221.679 --> 6226.32
right okay so it's not like a prevalent

6224.08 --> 6228.48
thing

6226.32 --> 6229.5199999999995
it's not like oh it's jesus statues

6228.48 --> 6231.678999999999
everywhere

6229.52 --> 6234.0
of this color because that's how they do

6231.679 --> 6236.4800000000005
it no

6234.0 --> 6236.48
interesting

6238.0 --> 6245.28
so yeah maybe jesus literally was a

6241.199 --> 6247.678999999999
white guy even though he was like in

6245.28 --> 6249.44
bethlehem

6247.679 --> 6252.2390000000005
and he would have been like off it's

6249.44 --> 6254.5599999999995
like yeah everybody there is just

6252.239 --> 6256.159
kind of brownish

6254.56 --> 6261.080000000001
perhaps

6256.159 --> 6261.08
i don't know maybe some tribes weren't

6264.56 --> 6269.52
yeah darker skinned versions in latin

6266.4 --> 6272.5599999999995
america yeah well i did see a couple

6269.52 --> 6276.2390000000005
but at first that nothing popped up it's

6272.56 --> 6276.2390000000005
just like detroit and

6276.48 --> 6279.04
canada

6286.239 --> 6290.959999999999
buddha is also depicted as black okay

6291.6 --> 6294.639
a little weird

6301.52 --> 6305.6
but what if

6302.96 --> 6307.92
like our physical body race our souls

6305.6 --> 6312.08
belong to a race

6307.92 --> 6313.679
like the elves doors and the trolls

6312.08 --> 6317.28
maybe

6313.679 --> 6319.119
maybe they do a bit

6317.28 --> 6321.92
maybe or you could see it more like

6319.119 --> 6326.639
energy like the weave and it's like okay

6321.92 --> 6327.6
you're coming from these races or this

6326.639 --> 6329.4400000000005
group

6327.6 --> 6332.639
of genetic

6329.44 --> 6334.96
this genetic group you your spirit your

6332.639 --> 6337.04
character will start to have wheeled

6334.96 --> 6340.32
energies and resonate in a certain

6337.04 --> 6343.199
frequency that typically then resonates

6340.32 --> 6345.84
with a whole part of that

6343.199 --> 6345.839999999999
gene group

6346.159 --> 6350.159
so yeah

6347.92 --> 6353.52
where where do you go

6350.159 --> 6355.5199999999995
after death maybe it is like heavens are

6353.52 --> 6357.6
sort of like

6355.52 --> 6358.8
genetic related because of the way your

6357.6 --> 6360.4800000000005
spirit

6358.8 --> 6362.88
crystallizes

6360.48 --> 6365.599999999999
thanks to your genetic background

6362.88 --> 6367.1990000000005
who knows who knows man

6365.6 --> 6371.56
there might be something to it but i

6367.199 --> 6371.5599999999995
don't think it's like really important

6374.88 --> 6378.96
yeah our bodies are just vessels but

6376.639 --> 6380.4800000000005
they are also

6378.96 --> 6382.8
the channel

6380.48 --> 6385.28
through which we are crystallized

6382.8 --> 6387.28
right our character

6385.28 --> 6389.44
that we are the how we recognize

6387.28 --> 6390.32
ourselves how we go about how we feel

6389.44 --> 6391.759999999999
even

6390.32 --> 6395.599999999999
is based

6391.76 --> 6395.6
on the properties of the vessel

6395.76 --> 6400.0
you see

6397.119 --> 6402.719
so our very manifestation and how we

6400.0 --> 6403.76
interact through the vessel

6402.719 --> 6408.08
is

6403.76 --> 6408.08
greatly influenced by the vessel

6411.119 --> 6414.599999999999
that just happens

6418.48 --> 6424.959999999999
yeah steamy traveler yeah apparently he

6420.719 --> 6424.96
did he died in his sleep last night

6426.48 --> 6430.839999999999
yeah pretty shocking unexpected

6444.239 --> 6449.599999999999
he'd been ill for days yeah but how by

6446.96 --> 6449.6
the way what

6450.719 --> 6454.199
like what happened

6456.56 --> 6459.52
what type of ill

6460.239 --> 6464.638999999999
right don't know so that's

6462.08 --> 6465.84
yeah that makes it complicated right

6464.639 --> 6469.76
maybe

6465.84 --> 6472.08
the ancestral winds hit him so hard

6469.76 --> 6474.2390000000005
that he couldn't

6472.08 --> 6475.44
yeah that he couldn't handle the

6474.239 --> 6477.599999999999
transition

6475.44 --> 6480.159
that he literally perished under this

6477.6 --> 6482.56
ancestral winds that can happen

6480.159 --> 6484.96
depends on how you manage your life and

6482.56 --> 6486.639
how you deal with your problems if you

6484.96 --> 6488.88
make a habit

6486.639 --> 6491.28
of putting everything aside constantly

6488.88 --> 6493.28
to just focus on what you want to focus

6491.28 --> 6495.36
then when the ancestral winds hit you

6493.28 --> 6497.84
and you suddenly can't do that anymore

6495.36 --> 6500.08
sometimes the weight of everything

6497.84 --> 6502.400000000001
becomes so much that you can physically

6500.08 --> 6502.4
die

6502.96 --> 6508.639
i have no physical evidence of this by

6505.84 --> 6512.32
the way that that happens i believe it

6508.639 --> 6515.119
i believe that happens because sometimes

6512.32 --> 6518.0
i actively work not to put everything

6515.119 --> 6519.92
aside to avoid doing that and even then

6518.0 --> 6520.719
sometimes just the weight coming on to

6519.92 --> 6524.92
me

6520.719 --> 6524.92
is is just deadly

6527.36 --> 6534.719
he wasn't very odd that's correct

6530.719 --> 6534.719
do you think the controller's killed no

6535.28 --> 6539.599999999999
no he died in his bed he didn't go

6537.92 --> 6541.6
through the sea protocol or anything

6539.6 --> 6544.4800000000005
steamy traveler

6541.6 --> 6546.2390000000005
i don't know what happened

6544.48 --> 6548.5599999999995
i i think he was

6546.239 --> 6550.48
pretty damn anti-v

6548.56 --> 6553.4800000000005
so he's probably not dead because of

6550.48 --> 6553.48
that

6556.719 --> 6559.28
i don't know

6561.84 --> 6564.159000000001
dude

6565.28 --> 6569.84
one thing that i do know about him is

6567.199 --> 6572.159
that he was always vaping

6569.84 --> 6574.400000000001
so much

6572.159 --> 6576.4
not saying that that is the cause i

6574.4 --> 6579.36
don't know what is the cause but i i

6576.4 --> 6583.36
know that he wasn't like a

6579.36 --> 6586.08
like a obsessed health nut

6583.36 --> 6588.4
he would just eat garbage sometimes

6586.08 --> 6591.36
he's easy openly admitted that he was

6588.4 --> 6593.119
just like no i'm not going to let

6591.36 --> 6595.679
all that [ __ ] stop me i just want to do

6593.119 --> 6597.839999999999
what i want to do so maybe he just

6595.679 --> 6597.84
yeah

6598.08 --> 6602.239
took in some things that he couldn't

6599.92 --> 6602.2390000000005
handle

6603.84 --> 6609.4400000000005
like one time the risk of just going

6606.639 --> 6611.84
about like that's at some point yeah

6609.44 --> 6613.759999999999
it just

6611.84 --> 6617.92
do you smoke or vape at all no i don't

6613.76 --> 6617.92
vape at all i do smoke

6618.96 --> 6621.92
i'm not vaping

6622.88 --> 6627.05
and every every time i smoke

6625.92 --> 6629.04
i use

6627.05 --> 6630.719
[Applause]

6629.04 --> 6632.0
carbon filters

6630.719 --> 6636.04
this stuff

6632.0 --> 6636.04
been using that for

6639.119 --> 6644.0
seven years

6641.44 --> 6646.239
it's a world of difference because the

6644.0 --> 6648.56
carbon granules in that

6646.239 --> 6651.5599999999995
they absorb a lot of the very damaging

6648.56 --> 6651.56
stuff

6652.32 --> 6657.5199999999995
like i don't want to smoke without those

6654.48 --> 6657.5199999999995
anymore ever

6658.159 --> 6662.0
and i don't really smoke like cigarettes

6660.4 --> 6662.799999999999
or just

6662.0 --> 6665.199
like

6662.8 --> 6668.159000000001
self-rolled things i only really just

6665.199 --> 6668.159
smoked joints

6668.239 --> 6671.879999999999
and not constantly

6688.32 --> 6692.04
okay jason see

6703.76 --> 6708.0
right i think i'm gonna round out the

6705.52 --> 6709.1990000000005
show

6708.0 --> 6712.159
ah

6709.199 --> 6713.919999999999
it's been a good show oh wow look at

6712.159 --> 6715.199
this

6713.92 --> 6718.4
wow

6715.199 --> 6718.4
that's just beautiful

6721.44 --> 6727.839999999999
isn't that just amazing

6724.639 --> 6727.84
it's like a little painting

6728.48 --> 6735.32
the blue sky and the light hitting it

6732.0 --> 6735.32
it's beautiful

6744.88 --> 6748.36
don't you think

6752.56 --> 6757.56
birds

6753.84 --> 6757.56
frolicking about

6779.599 --> 6782.8
want to quit right

6785.44 --> 6789.04
respirator health has never been better

6787.28 --> 6793.119
because of vaping

6789.04 --> 6795.28
so you don't get like mucus

6793.119 --> 6796.799999999999
well look

6795.28 --> 6801.5199999999995
for a guy that

6796.8 --> 6804.400000000001
smokes my lungs are pretty damn good

6801.52 --> 6807.84
since i started using the carbon filters

6804.4 --> 6807.839999999999
now there's everything

6811.36 --> 6815.839999999999
also i've had great benefit from

6814.48 --> 6819.28
the

6815.84 --> 6821.679
raw tobacco leaves that i got from

6819.28 --> 6823.44
yeah from the mail

6821.679 --> 6825.679
but i've run through them all so i'm

6823.44 --> 6828.48
unfortunately i'm back to just american

6825.679 --> 6830.8
spirit brand because yeah i ran out and

6828.48 --> 6832.879999999999
it's gonna cost like at least 200 euros

6830.8 --> 6836.400000000001
or something getting new order and it

6832.88 --> 6840.599
will take a while anyway to get here so

6836.4 --> 6840.598999999999
right to each throw no that's fine

6856.08 --> 6863.5199999999995
how much are smokes where you are at

6859.599 --> 6868.4800000000005
how much are expensive

6863.52 --> 6868.4800000000005
very expensive like the taxes are crazy

6870.159 --> 6875.119
it's like 95 tax

6873.04 --> 6877.5199999999995
something and it constantly gets more

6875.119 --> 6880.159
expensive

6877.52 --> 6881.679
jacob goldman tell us what happened to

6880.159 --> 6883.44
folk i don't know exactly what happened

6881.679 --> 6886.08
i just heard it at the beginning of the

6883.44 --> 6888.239
show jacob goldman

6886.08 --> 6889.5199999999995
seems like he's just like a flat earth

6888.239 --> 6892.32
folk or just

6889.52 --> 6895.1990000000005
died in his sleep he was kind of sick i

6892.32 --> 6897.5199999999995
don't know what type of sick

6895.199 --> 6899.598999999999
he had been like ill for a week and now

6897.52 --> 6901.84
he suddenly died that's it that's all i

6899.599 --> 6901.84
know

6902.48 --> 6905.839999999999
rest in peace

6917.04 --> 6922.0
