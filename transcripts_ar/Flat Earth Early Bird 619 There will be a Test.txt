6.2 --> 36.56
[Music]

48.48 --> 52.07899999999999
good

49.52 --> 53.760000000000005
morning welcome to flat earth early bird

52.079 --> 56.079
number 619

53.76 --> 57.839999999999996
i'm your host irwin and before we start

56.079 --> 59.92
the show please don't forget to share it

57.84 --> 61.68000000000001
on any platform you deem fit and if you

59.92 --> 63.199
haven't already subscribe to my channel

61.68 --> 65.119
and hit the bell notification so you

63.199 --> 67.2
know when i'm going live

65.119 --> 68.32
which is normally 2 p.m amsterdam time

67.2 --> 70.08
every day

68.32 --> 71.83999999999999
please also do support me through the

70.08 --> 73.84
paypal patreon the super chat and the

71.84 --> 77.84
membership system join button

73.84 --> 80.4
they'll be much appreciated ah

77.84 --> 82.64
yeah sorry for being late i got caught

80.4 --> 84.72
up with a conversation with my roommate

82.64 --> 87.759
and i completely forgot about the time

84.72 --> 92.15899999999999
sorry about that so

87.759 --> 95.84
weather today is different again it's

92.159 --> 98.159
very clear skies and yeah i went out for

95.84 --> 101.119
groceries today and it was actually

98.159 --> 104.47900000000001
cold even though the sun was right on me

101.119 --> 106.479
it was cold the wind was very very cold

104.479 --> 107.759
i think it's probably warmed up a little

106.479 --> 111.03999999999999
since then

107.759 --> 112.0
it does seem a lot warmer outside but it

111.04 --> 114.96000000000001
has been that blue

112.0 --> 116.96
clear sky with some white fluffy clouds

114.96 --> 121.03999999999999
in between

116.96 --> 121.03999999999999
pretty much all day very sunny

122.88 --> 125.28
all right

126.96 --> 134.07999999999998
so i don't know is my volume low

130.479 --> 136.31900000000002
it's weird it seems a little lower than

134.08 --> 139.44000000000003
usual

136.319 --> 142.07999999999998
anyway i got grapefruit juice with me

139.44 --> 157.84
and green tea haven't poured it in yet

142.08 --> 157.84
do that

159.04 --> 162.64
right so let's see who's in chat

165.92 --> 171.83999999999997
amanda young was first nicholas riddle

169.04 --> 171.84
robin stanley

174.4 --> 185.84
here we go again sarita constantino kim

177.599 --> 185.83999999999997
robinson ryan eartherton

197.519 --> 205.12
flirting whatever uh

202.08 --> 208.959
that's probably a troll um

205.12 --> 213.84
right oh john john

208.959 --> 213.84
who is john john you say

224.84 --> 227.84
tank

229.17 --> 232.39999999999998
[Music]

243.28 --> 249.439
a man that's young is john john

247.04 --> 250.72
what are you saying that john john max

249.439 --> 252.879
is

250.72 --> 256.16
amanda jung's brother are you actually

252.879 --> 260.15999999999997
saying that jason mccormack

256.16 --> 260.16
that's [ __ ] up

260.56 --> 264.56
concave arthur stalker is amanda jung's

263.52 --> 269.84
brother

264.56 --> 269.84
are you literally saying that

275.44 --> 283.84
i'd like to have some confirmation of

277.36 --> 283.84000000000003
that from amanda jung

288.639 --> 294.84000000000003
all right until then i'm banning him

292.0 --> 297.84
don't give a [ __ ] whose family uh you

294.84 --> 297.84
are

297.93 --> 301.11
[Music]

304.38 --> 308.36
[Music]

312.96 --> 319.52
well that's what mamanda young says

316.24 --> 323.44
but maybe she was just trying to make me

319.52 --> 325.52
not yeah make me stop

323.44 --> 328.16
not liking him or something which is

325.52 --> 330.15999999999997
never going to happen

328.16 --> 339.39000000000004
and i do appreciate if she wouldn't do

330.16 --> 346.569
that again ever

339.39 --> 346.56899999999996
[Music]

359.44 --> 381.68
right um anyway

366.08 --> 384.08
see i got a lot of notes a lot of notes

381.68 --> 385.68
oh yeah the test that's right i wrote it

384.08 --> 388.88
down

385.68 --> 388.88
the test is for you

389.28 --> 397.84
test was for you

394.479 --> 398.479
uh yeah because at the flat earth debate

397.84 --> 401.88
uh

398.479 --> 405.199
premiere yesterday from

401.88 --> 408.639
1221 which was from friday by the way i

405.199 --> 410.8
put some text in the chat

408.639 --> 411.919
i said something and here we go again

410.8 --> 414.639
said yeah

411.919 --> 415.12
exactly something in that direction and

414.639 --> 417.199
then

415.12 --> 419.199
i asked him like okay so does that mean

417.199 --> 422.479
that you actually

419.199 --> 423.84000000000003
know what i meant can you feed that back

422.479 --> 426.56
to me

423.84 --> 428.0
can you explain that to me in your own

426.56 --> 430.24
words

428.0 --> 431.36
right because i said earth is

430.24 --> 433.84000000000003
rectangular

431.36 --> 436.0
irregular looping with potential for

433.84 --> 438.23999999999995
spatial dynamics alteration over

436.0 --> 438.24
time

439.12 --> 451.84000000000003
so there's your test

442.479 --> 451.84
what does that mean

459.0 --> 462.209
[Music]

474.96 --> 479.84
oh by the way i got a new cord for my

477.039 --> 479.84
hanger here

482.03 --> 486.479
[Music]

484.319 --> 487.36
yo why would you need to find another

486.479 --> 490.639
word for it

487.36 --> 493.199
i'm not asking you to

490.639 --> 494.08
literally say the same thing i said but

493.199 --> 497.199
try to use

494.08 --> 500.71999999999997
other words to replace each word in the

497.199 --> 500.72
same sentence that's not what i

501.039 --> 507.68
what i asked for what i asked for is a

504.4 --> 511.44
feedback that explains

507.68 --> 511.44
you understand what it meant

513.599 --> 521.839
right in your own words

522.159 --> 526.399
right so again earth is rectangular

524.959 --> 530.0799999999999
irregular looping

526.399 --> 535.839
with potential for spatial dynamics

530.08 --> 535.839
alteration over time

551.44 --> 558.1600000000001
i don't jest you should know that by now

556.08 --> 562.08
if i'm making a joke about something

558.16 --> 564.7199999999999
you'll know because you're laughing

562.08 --> 565.44
if you're just like oh he is probably

564.72 --> 577.839
joking

565.44 --> 577.839
then you're probably wrong

578.64 --> 581.76
[Music]

582.32 --> 586.399
yeah no no but it's i don't know this is

585.6 --> 589.2
something

586.399 --> 591.2
that i'm doing and i'm gonna do more

589.2 --> 593.6
because yeah i'm a teacher right i'm a

591.2 --> 596.48
teacher of cosmogeny

593.6 --> 598.32
through my own discipline and that's

596.48 --> 601.44
really nice that people

598.32 --> 604.8000000000001
want to listen to that but if

601.44 --> 608.8000000000001
after explaining it

604.8 --> 612.0
dozens of times over over a span of

608.8 --> 614.16
one or several years

612.0 --> 615.92
they're still coming and they're still

614.16 --> 617.519
not able to feed back

615.92 --> 619.4399999999999
what it actually means that i'm

617.519 --> 621.839
explaining that i'm not a successful

619.44 --> 621.839
teacher

625.76 --> 630.48
right and that's also by the way why i

628.56 --> 634.959
was very happy to hear

630.48 --> 638.24
sleeping warrior yesterday basically

634.959 --> 639.04
feeding back that he exactly got my

638.24 --> 642.0
position

639.04 --> 642.959
on what the sun is he explained it back

642.0 --> 646.0
perfectly like

642.959 --> 649.1199999999999
that made me really happy because

646.0 --> 652.079
it means that sleeping warrior actually

649.12 --> 652.079
really gets it

653.76 --> 657.92
that's a great relief

656.22 --> 661.279
[Music]

657.92 --> 664.959
right okay please explain so that i

661.279 --> 666.64
understand well right

664.959 --> 669.1999999999999
it's basically the first sentence earth

666.64 --> 670.24
is a rectangular irregular looping so

669.2 --> 673.6800000000001
that means

670.24 --> 676.9590000000001
it's rectangular as a baseline

673.68 --> 679.68
assumption to visualize it but it's

676.959 --> 682.8
rectangular

679.68 --> 683.519
roughly but it's also irregular so that

682.8 --> 687.04
means

683.519 --> 690.72
irregular looping means that

687.04 --> 695.36
there is a loop but it's not the same

690.72 --> 696.64
loop the looping effect is not the same

695.36 --> 698.64
everywhere

696.64 --> 700.24
and i think that that is probably very

698.64 --> 702.959
likely

700.24 --> 703.92
in which yeah for example irregular

702.959 --> 707.1999999999999
looping would be

703.92 --> 708.079
if the equator line geometrically lines

707.2 --> 713.839
up

708.079 --> 713.8389999999999
perfectly like a circle over a flat disc

713.92 --> 719.1999999999999
and that would be regular looping

716.959 --> 720.16
normally or well that would not be

719.2 --> 724.0
looping

720.16 --> 728.079
necessarily unless there were yeah

724.0 --> 730.8
there's the circle inside of that circle

728.079 --> 733.04
more to the presumed center would not

730.8 --> 733.04
fit

733.279 --> 736.48
in between the other circle

735.36 --> 738.0
geometrically and

736.48 --> 739.76
on the outside the same now that would

738.0 --> 743.12
be irregular looping

739.76 --> 746.16
because then there must be a loop effect

743.12 --> 750.16
yet the loop does close

746.16 --> 753.76
at least in ways like a circle

750.16 --> 755.36
so there is a a geometrical circle loop

753.76 --> 757.279
going on at one part

755.36 --> 760.32
and at the other part it's probably an

757.279 --> 764.399
incomplete circle

760.32 --> 766.0
or yeah this is basically

764.399 --> 767.6
it basically points at special

766.0 --> 770.16
non-linearity so

767.6 --> 772.16
if i say rectangular irregular looping

770.16 --> 775.4399999999999
that simply means

772.16 --> 778.3199999999999
it's looping it's roughly rectangular

775.44 --> 780.0790000000001
in its setup but the loop is likely

778.32 --> 783.9200000000001
irregular

780.079 --> 788.8
so like yeah a flat globe

783.92 --> 792.4799999999999
is irregular looping for example

788.8 --> 794.959
and well the s the potential

792.48 --> 797.12
for spatial dynamics alteration over

794.959 --> 800.16
time that simply means that

797.12 --> 801.36
i yeah that there is potential within

800.16 --> 804.48
the loop

801.36 --> 807.2
looping realm confine that the

804.48 --> 808.5600000000001
loop itself and the space in between the

807.2 --> 811.839
loop

808.56 --> 814.0
may alter so it is like a

811.839 --> 817.2
almost like the loop and the space

814.0 --> 820.079
itself could be considered like a puddle

817.2 --> 822.1600000000001
and that puddle could change shape so

820.079 --> 824.88
literally the loop within

822.16 --> 825.6
certain east to west situations could

824.88 --> 828.72
grow

825.6 --> 829.839
in length potentially it literally could

828.72 --> 834.1600000000001
grow in length

829.839 --> 837.44
or other spots could shrink in length

834.16 --> 840.8389999999999
that kind of thing yeah

837.44 --> 843.839
that's the alteration potential over

840.839 --> 843.839
time

853.76 --> 860.399
bit like pac-man theory

856.8 --> 865.04
no no pac-man theory is a very

860.399 --> 870.079
early attempt to figure out

865.04 --> 873.519
yeah rectangular looping

870.079 --> 876.56
it's underdeveloped i've

873.519 --> 880.72
expanded greatly

876.56 --> 880.7199999999999
on the yeah the potential of it

881.12 --> 887.36
loop ping not loop p

884.32 --> 887.36
thank you very much

887.839 --> 913.839
if it is technically concave

899.36 --> 913.839
youtube stalling again

925.199 --> 927.5999999999999
all right

942.8 --> 947.519
wait i should make some new notes for

945.04 --> 951.92
the tuesday

947.519 --> 954.16
right here again missed iron roll media

951.92 --> 957.199
had a stream exactly when i was away i

954.16 --> 957.199
don't know how they do it

958.24 --> 962.32
and that was today but i missed it

963.92 --> 969.8389999999999
[Music]

966.839 --> 969.839
um

970.32 --> 973.44
yeah i think i spent most time yesterday

972.56 --> 976.6389999999999
gaming

973.44 --> 983.6800000000001
didn't go to bed that late

976.639 --> 987.04
i was watching all kinds of stuff

983.68 --> 990.0
it's a bit of owen benjamin but i didn't

987.04 --> 990.0
catch the whole thing

995.6 --> 999.519
oh yeah because he had the uh

998.04 --> 1003.36
[Music]

999.519 --> 1006.9590000000001
what's his name for the uh yeah the

1003.36 --> 1008.839
the dnd farming guy what was his name

1006.959 --> 1011.8389999999999
again the

1008.839 --> 1011.839
uh

1014.0 --> 1018.56
wait maybe i still have it in the old

1016.16 --> 1018.56
notes

1021.44 --> 1025.52
yeah urban farmer that's this guy the

1023.68 --> 1028.24
same guy he hit him on again

1025.52 --> 1028.24
pretty awesome

1029.76 --> 1033.679
but yeah again i missed half of it so

1036.72 --> 1042.319
also been watching some more rodrigo

1039.28 --> 1042.319
ferrari nunez

1042.64 --> 1046.24
because yeah he does uh streams pretty

1045.0 --> 1049.2
regularly

1046.24 --> 1050.559
these days and he even had last night

1049.2 --> 1053.44
which i didn't miss

1050.559 --> 1056.3999999999999
when i was live but he had a like a

1053.44 --> 1060.0
three hour hangout

1056.4 --> 1060.0
with callers and all that

1061.44 --> 1067.8400000000001
and it was pretty good

1069.919 --> 1073.2
i'm here robin stanley

1078.84 --> 1081.84
uh

1084.559 --> 1089.36
all right yeah yeah yeah robin stanley

1087.84 --> 1092.6399999999999
did you get a chance to

1089.36 --> 1096.08
read that pdf file

1092.64 --> 1098.96
which is so incredibly old by the way

1096.08 --> 1101.6
i think i made that pretty quickly after

1098.96 --> 1103.44
no trees came out

1101.6 --> 1107.039
no trees on flat earth situation

1103.44 --> 1109.8400000000001
happened and then i just had this big

1107.039 --> 1111.36
vision related thing and that i kind of

1109.84 --> 1115.039
tied into my visions

1111.36 --> 1115.76
back then very early on and i wrote this

1115.039 --> 1118.32
down and

1115.76 --> 1119.84
i don't know it's like it's weird when i

1118.32 --> 1122.8799999999999
read it

1119.84 --> 1123.84
read this specific thing which i don't

1122.88 --> 1127.44
think i've ever

1123.84 --> 1131.4399999999998
openly put out like that

1127.44 --> 1134.72
it gives me a weird weird feeling yeah

1131.44 --> 1137.76
i'm not entirely settled on it yet

1134.72 --> 1142.64
and there's also been even back then

1137.76 --> 1145.44
just like reconsiderations like okay

1142.64 --> 1147.5200000000002
i built it to kind of fill it to give it

1145.44 --> 1149.44
a shape to give things a place in the

1147.52 --> 1152.8799999999999
wider context

1149.44 --> 1154.72
and it was okay but

1152.88 --> 1157.1200000000001
there's probably a lot that could be

1154.72 --> 1159.52
improved upon

1157.12 --> 1161.6
and some things that i might it might

1159.52 --> 1163.44
simply be better to be left out because

1161.6 --> 1168.1599999999999
they're not really that significant

1163.44 --> 1168.16
in the bigger picture anyway

1169.84 --> 1174.1599999999999
all right it was about my the history of

1172.72 --> 1176.96
the world

1174.16 --> 1179.8400000000001
back then the elaborate version not just

1176.96 --> 1179.8400000000001
the phases

1182.0 --> 1186.559
because i have that page what is it

1184.96 --> 1188.4
reddit

1186.559 --> 1190.72
that i've shared here it's pretty much

1188.4 --> 1193.8400000000001
that except it's the more expanded

1190.72 --> 1193.84
version of it

1218.84 --> 1221.84
hmm

1233.33 --> 1236.3799999999999
[Music]

1238.48 --> 1241.039
anyway

1242.4 --> 1246.159
yeah i'm a bit flustered by the heat

1246.32 --> 1249.9189999999999
i don't know why but i feel kind of

1248.0 --> 1252.0
tired

1249.919 --> 1253.8400000000001
and i think i had a pretty good rest

1252.0 --> 1263.84
last night

1253.84 --> 1263.84
i don't know why that is

1268.559 --> 1273.28
yeah you did you did fail your test

1270.72 --> 1273.28
that's right

1273.919 --> 1279.1200000000001
but hey you've only been here for what

1276.96 --> 1282.24
is it a month or so

1279.12 --> 1283.52
so yeah that's all right

1282.24 --> 1285.44
you know you didn't even know it

1283.52 --> 1287.36
actually was a test you know

1285.44 --> 1289.679
people i guess that all these people

1287.36 --> 1290.0
here everyone just likes to come to my

1289.679 --> 1292.159
show

1290.0 --> 1293.36
and just think oh that sounds really

1292.159 --> 1296.24
interesting when he talks

1293.36 --> 1296.6399999999999
that really complicated stuff and then

1296.24 --> 1299.039
think

1296.64 --> 1301.2800000000002
that i'm just telling it like a

1299.039 --> 1304.4
storyteller and that's it

1301.28 --> 1305.36
well no not really no everything that

1304.4 --> 1308.72
i'm telling is

1305.36 --> 1309.6
actually structural and i'm telling it

1308.72 --> 1312.799
because i

1309.6 --> 1315.28
hope that it's gonna catch on

1312.799 --> 1317.2
and why do i hope it's gonna catch on

1315.28 --> 1320.32
because it makes sense

1317.2 --> 1323.6000000000001
it is the works

1320.32 --> 1326.72
deeper down the line that most people

1323.6 --> 1329.9189999999999
don't get to because they get caught up

1326.72 --> 1332.32
in stories they get pulled in by

1329.919 --> 1333.2
things that get closer to their heart or

1332.32 --> 1336.559
their personal

1333.2 --> 1339.039
feelings and they like that

1336.559 --> 1340.08
more they like going about like that

1339.039 --> 1343.6
more

1340.08 --> 1347.6789999999999
they don't see the giant

1343.6 --> 1349.6
looming threat above it all

1347.679 --> 1351.2
even though they intellectually know

1349.6 --> 1355.4399999999998
there are threats they don't

1351.2 --> 1359.6000000000001
realize that we don't have time

1355.44 --> 1360.4
to just hang around and have fun all the

1359.6 --> 1362.559
time with

1360.4 --> 1363.6000000000001
the luxuries from the systems that are

1362.559 --> 1366.799
still in place

1363.6 --> 1367.1999999999998
as they are literally eroding from under

1366.799 --> 1370.799
our

1367.2 --> 1370.799
feet and being taken away

1371.6 --> 1376.1589999999999
what i'm saying is if you find something

1374.0 --> 1380.559
interesting

1376.159 --> 1383.679
then figure out if it really has value

1380.559 --> 1386.8799999999999
and when you do understand it

1383.679 --> 1389.1200000000001
learn to understand it really

1386.88 --> 1390.24
get it and really getting it doesn't

1389.12 --> 1393.84
mean that you can just

1390.24 --> 1396.88
repeat it it means that you can actually

1393.84 --> 1400.08
explain to somebody else

1396.88 --> 1402.72
what it means and

1400.08 --> 1405.4399999999998
what comes alongside with it what are

1402.72 --> 1411.2
the options that come with it

1405.44 --> 1413.52
understand it not just copy paste

1411.2 --> 1415.52
everybody can copy paste it doesn't make

1413.52 --> 1418.96
you smarter it doesn't

1415.52 --> 1420.8799999999999
make you informed you gotta understand

1418.96 --> 1421.76
what people are talking about or you're

1420.88 --> 1431.8400000000001
literally

1421.76 --> 1431.84
wasting your time

1432.559 --> 1435.6789999999999
right well the ability to use the

1435.12 --> 1438.8799999999999
knowledge

1435.679 --> 1441.3600000000001
comes afterwards you know once you

1438.88 --> 1442.4
actually understand something then it's

1441.36 --> 1444.3999999999999
up to you

1442.4 --> 1445.52
you got the tool you suddenly know how

1444.4 --> 1448.799
to use it

1445.52 --> 1452.559
well opportunities will no doubt

1448.799 --> 1452.559
pop up for you to use it

1457.52 --> 1464.08
but you'll probably only even recognize

1459.52 --> 1464.08
the situations if you know how to use it

1466.19 --> 1471.44
[Music]

1468.24 --> 1472.0
people have sticky fingers at your job i

1471.44 --> 1487.8400000000001
don't know what

1472.0 --> 1487.84
does that mean

1493.2 --> 1499.3600000000001
right well good glad you'll find it

1496.96 --> 1515.44
interesting

1499.36 --> 1528.799
oh okay yeah that's annoying

1515.44 --> 1543.8400000000001
all right right

1528.799 --> 1543.84
all right

1564.32 --> 1570.9299999999998
kim robinson how does that get

1567.679 --> 1572.0
how does it grow work floor culture

1570.93 --> 1575.279
[Music]

1572.0 --> 1577.679
what is the norm what is going around

1575.279 --> 1579.36
once people get an attitude of like yeah

1577.679 --> 1581.3600000000001
it doesn't matter like if you're ripped

1579.36 --> 1583.9189999999999
from the company or whatever

1581.36 --> 1584.799
and it's not being like choked on the

1583.919 --> 1588.72
spot

1584.799 --> 1589.44
socially so not rules no somebody else

1588.72 --> 1593.039
literally

1589.44 --> 1596.64
catching somebody saying that and then

1593.039 --> 1599.76
socially shaming them for it and setting

1596.64 --> 1601.919
example to others not saying firing

1599.76 --> 1603.52
but yeah unless you do that yeah people

1601.919 --> 1606.4
are going to be like oh yeah whatever

1603.52 --> 1606.4
i'm just here to

1606.559 --> 1609.76
to do whatever i like

1610.48 --> 1614.24
so it's a matter of authority really in

1612.799 --> 1617.6
the company

1614.24 --> 1627.84
there's no real authority then yeah that

1617.6 --> 1627.84
sort of thing does happen

1628.69 --> 1631.739
[Music]

1633.84 --> 1642.8799999999999
right robin stanley yeah it is

1640.559 --> 1655.84
like petty theft is often born from

1642.88 --> 1655.8400000000001
arrogance that's true

1675.44 --> 1679.279
stealing is the government's job

1680.84 --> 1687.4399999999998
right

1682.96 --> 1687.44
well it's their only means to expand

1692.48 --> 1701.6
it's either reaction problem solution

1696.48 --> 1704.559
i mean problem reaction solution

1701.6 --> 1704.8799999999999
was it what you know what i mean or it's

1704.559 --> 1707.279
like

1704.88 --> 1709.6000000000001
okay we gotta expand we don't know how

1707.279 --> 1710.0
to manipulate them into giving it to us

1709.6 --> 1713.84
so we're

1710.0 --> 1713.84
gonna have to sort of steal it

1716.64 --> 1725.8400000000001
and just hope we can get away with it

1718.399 --> 1725.84
for long enough

1735.679 --> 1739.8400000000001
right anyway

1741.52 --> 1747.679
no i've already watched it all

1750.08 --> 1753.84
a long time ago

1754.799 --> 1757.84
right from a reaction solution that was

1757.2 --> 1762.559
the

1757.84 --> 1765.4399999999998
i mean it's solution problem reaction

1762.559 --> 1766.0
you know but usually when within that

1765.44 --> 1769.8400000000001
system they

1766.0 --> 1770.72
already have the three effects necessary

1769.84 --> 1772.72
so they can

1770.72 --> 1774.24
they could put it in any order they like

1772.72 --> 1776.24
yeah they could definitely bring the

1774.24 --> 1778.3990000000001
solution first because they already know

1776.24 --> 1778.3990000000001
it

1779.12 --> 1784.08
but in order for these psychological

1782.399 --> 1786.8799999999999
societal effect to

1784.08 --> 1787.4399999999998
happen the way the mec the mechanism

1786.88 --> 1790.3200000000002
works you

1787.44 --> 1795.8400000000001
do have to do it in that specific order

1790.32 --> 1795.84
that's right

1823.44 --> 1826.799
yeah i don't know if that's true george

1825.2 --> 1830.159
stanford

1826.799 --> 1832.24
you know a very good

1830.159 --> 1834.24
strategy for if you get held up or

1832.24 --> 1836.799
something by somebody with a weapon who

1834.24 --> 1838.559
wants to rob you and then you're like oh

1836.799 --> 1840.0
yeah yeah no don't don't worry i'm not

1838.559 --> 1843.279
gonna resist you i'm gonna

1840.0 --> 1846.24
calmly give you everything you want

1843.279 --> 1846.48
that's consenting right does that make

1846.24 --> 1850.88
it

1846.48 --> 1855.679
not theft

1850.88 --> 1858.88
i don't think so that was still theft

1855.679 --> 1863.039
it's just that the consenting action was

1858.88 --> 1864.0
done to prevent damage that was expected

1863.039 --> 1867.2
for when you don't

1864.0 --> 1879.039
consent see that's still

1867.2 --> 1882.3990000000001
that that doesn't not make it theft

1879.039 --> 1884.1589999999999
no it's it's not theft if you literally

1882.399 --> 1887.6789999999999
don't have to do it and there is

1884.159 --> 1890.0800000000002
absolutely guaranteed no consequences

1887.679 --> 1891.8400000000001
and then you give it because you believe

1890.08 --> 1894.6399999999999
in the goal it's going to be

1891.84 --> 1896.6399999999999
it's presumed to be used for then it's

1894.64 --> 1899.039
not fast because then you gave it on

1896.64 --> 1900.88
voluntary basis

1899.039 --> 1902.559
and you had the option not to without

1900.88 --> 1905.7600000000002
consequences

1902.559 --> 1921.84
for yourself legally or whatever

1905.76 --> 1921.84
that's different

1938.399 --> 1941.76
is this freaking

1942.08 --> 1949.84
it's you again isn't it

1950.08 --> 1963.84
oh god dammit

2004.48 --> 2011.6
right i don't know nicholas riddle

2007.76 --> 2013.84
if anything i'm a political neolist

2011.6 --> 2015.279
the more time passes the more i've

2013.84 --> 2020.08
completely given

2015.279 --> 2020.08
up on the entire concept entirely

2024.799 --> 2031.6
i think people should stop trying

2028.48 --> 2034.3990000000001
that just

2031.6 --> 2035.039
stop the [ __ ] just work on your own

2034.399 --> 2037.4399999999998
damn

2035.039 --> 2037.44
area

2038.88 --> 2042.159
and stop getting involved with other

2041.279 --> 2045.36
[ __ ]

2042.159 --> 2048.879
outside of your own area

2045.36 --> 2050.96
and if everybody does that

2048.879 --> 2053.2
yeah you wouldn't recognize the world

2050.96 --> 2053.2
back

2053.44 --> 2057.28
but of course not everybody is going to

2055.359 --> 2060.24
do that

2057.28 --> 2062.5600000000004
because yeah people get addicted to

2060.24 --> 2064.7999999999997
power

2062.56 --> 2066.32
and then they're gonna bring in politics

2064.8 --> 2075.8390000000004
and then any form

2066.32 --> 2075.839
and it will always go bad

2100.839 --> 2103.839
hmm

2116.4 --> 2123.28
what okay getting with someone

2120.8 --> 2125.28
i had my three-year-old screaming in my

2123.28 --> 2128.079
ear for snack

2125.28 --> 2128.96
when i said thank you to people in fe

2128.079 --> 2132.2400000000002
debate

2128.96 --> 2132.2400000000002
chat yesterday

2136.32 --> 2138.6400000000003
what

2143.2 --> 2147.68
oh yeah getting well you should know

2146.72 --> 2151.04
better than to

2147.68 --> 2153.839
actually communicate with that buffoon

2151.04 --> 2155.52
because the only reason he talks with

2153.839 --> 2158.32
other people is because he

2155.52 --> 2158.72
is trying to trick fish people into

2158.32 --> 2162.0
saying

2158.72 --> 2163.839
things that sort of indirectly back up

2162.0 --> 2166.16
his religious beliefs and that's the

2163.839 --> 2167.839
only thing he communicates with other

2166.16 --> 2171.04
people for anymore

2167.839 --> 2173.359
that's what a baller is so i wouldn't

2171.04 --> 2175.599
waste your time on that anymore

2173.359 --> 2177.04
because whatever you do you're always

2175.599 --> 2179.119
going to end up

2177.04 --> 2180.56
having said something you meant in

2179.119 --> 2183.28
another way and them

2180.56 --> 2185.44
just highlighting it and then doing

2183.28 --> 2188.2400000000002
their little victory dance about

2185.44 --> 2189.04
how a flat earther supposedly said

2188.24 --> 2190.8799999999997
something

2189.04 --> 2192.8
that would prove the ball and then

2190.88 --> 2196.079
they're squirting again all day

2192.8 --> 2198.7200000000003
right i wouldn't waste my time with that

2196.079 --> 2201.119
it's these people are such a waste of

2198.72 --> 2203.2799999999997
time it's

2201.119 --> 2204.6400000000003
i don't know i think it would be more

2203.28 --> 2207.28
productive to

2204.64 --> 2208.16
hang around homeless people all day

2207.28 --> 2210.5600000000004
literally

2208.16 --> 2215.68
it would literally be more productive

2210.56 --> 2229.839
intellectual and physical

2215.68 --> 2229.839
not even joking

2231.599 --> 2236.1600000000003
oh nicholas riddle i'm not an anarchist

2236.48 --> 2242.72
not really i'm not against rulers

2240.4 --> 2244.2400000000002
i'm just not going to follow their rules

2242.72 --> 2246.16
that's all

2244.24 --> 2248.56
i don't mind if other people want to be

2246.16 --> 2248.56
ruled

2248.88 --> 2253.2000000000003
they do unfortunately i used to kind of

2252.4 --> 2256.1600000000003
have that too

2253.2 --> 2257.9199999999996
i wanted to be ruled because i was too

2256.16 --> 2260.72
freaking

2257.92 --> 2262.8
lazy and naive to basically take the

2260.72 --> 2264.0789999999997
reins into my own hands and there's a

2262.8 --> 2267.119
lot of people of that

2264.079 --> 2270.96
it's very tough for a lot of people

2267.119 --> 2273.6800000000003
to learn that so yeah

2270.96 --> 2275.2
you can't be without a ruler like half

2273.68 --> 2278.3999999999996
the population will go

2275.2 --> 2285.839
nuts they will lit

2278.4 --> 2285.839
they will tear things apart

2288.32 --> 2292.0
yeah rulers leaders

2295.839 --> 2302.32
you know what i mean you know

2299.2 --> 2305.52
i'm all fine with it as long as

2302.32 --> 2307.6800000000003
i can go about not complying

2305.52 --> 2309.599
and not being restricted in where i can

2307.68 --> 2311.68
go or what i can buy

2309.599 --> 2314.8
what i can say then it's all fine and i

2311.68 --> 2314.7999999999997
literally don't care

2323.599 --> 2341.839
i have my opinions about it but i won't

2325.92 --> 2341.839
really care

2342.99 --> 2346.18
[Music]

2350.8 --> 2355.8390000000004
we need leaders not rulers well

2361.52 --> 2368.72
yeah how who determines what

2365.44 --> 2372.64
the rulers the controllers will be

2368.72 --> 2373.2799999999997
you know leaders step up if they've got

2372.64 --> 2376.4
the room

2373.28 --> 2380.079
if the control is actually

2376.4 --> 2382.8
in the hands of people and they know it

2380.079 --> 2386.079
then a leader can step forward and say

2382.8 --> 2388.32
okay i will delegate

2386.079 --> 2390.079
your collective leadership because i

2388.32 --> 2393.839
think i can do it pretty well

2390.079 --> 2393.8390000000004
under your permission

2394.32 --> 2398.079
and i will do it right vision and all

2396.88 --> 2401.119
that that's a leader

2398.079 --> 2404.4
that only works if the people

2401.119 --> 2407.599
actually have the control

2404.4 --> 2411.2000000000003
if not then a ruler will

2407.599 --> 2413.839
take that control and tell them yeah

2411.2 --> 2425.839
you're not getting it back

2413.839 --> 2425.839
that's the difference

2434.39 --> 2437.5699999999997
[Music]

2437.76 --> 2439.8390000000004
you

2447.15 --> 2450.889
[Music]

2455.52 --> 2464.4
yeah leadership only really exists

2459.52 --> 2465.28
in freedom it's a natural skill it only

2464.4 --> 2467.28
really

2465.28 --> 2468.6400000000003
works when there is freedom if there's

2467.28 --> 2470.4
no freedom

2468.64 --> 2472.319
if you have leadership skills you won't

2470.4 --> 2477.119
be able to utilize them

2472.319 --> 2477.119
because you'll not be free to

2478.72 --> 2482.64
and it's actually damn it's damaging to

2481.52 --> 2485.599
do that

2482.64 --> 2486.96
to be in a non-free system and to apply

2485.599 --> 2490.0
your leadership skills

2486.96 --> 2490.0
it damages you

2492.4 --> 2500.4
people like that get very old

2496.4 --> 2504.2400000000002
the typical place where you can see this

2500.4 --> 2504.48
where where i remember taking notice of

2504.24 --> 2508.0
it

2504.48 --> 2511.599
was like in the soviet union people that

2508.0 --> 2512.0
were trying to be leaders in the system

2511.599 --> 2516.319
that's

2512.0 --> 2520.839
[ __ ] up they got old this very

2516.319 --> 2523.2
draining and suffering it's it's very

2520.839 --> 2525.2799999999997
tough for

2523.2 --> 2527.5989999999997
a person that actually has a good heart

2525.28 --> 2530.4
and all that to

2527.599 --> 2531.3590000000004
try and be a leader in a system that is

2530.4 --> 2534.56
fundamentally

2531.359 --> 2538.0
unfree it's

2534.56 --> 2538.88
draining it's very difficult to persist

2538.0 --> 2543.119
that

2538.88 --> 2547.2000000000003
and not basically end up rebelling

2543.119 --> 2549.28
it's very tough my system is free

2547.2 --> 2550.319
free enough things might go wrong and

2549.28 --> 2552.96
all that

2550.319 --> 2554.4
but it won't be as tough because you got

2552.96 --> 2557.359
the freedom dynamics

2554.4 --> 2560.079
and you got more open honesty you can be

2557.359 --> 2560.0789999999997
closer to

2562.839 --> 2565.839
natural

2590.839 --> 2597.52
hmm

2593.119 --> 2599.76
way too complex to be random what

2597.52 --> 2599.7599999999998
what

2604.16 --> 2607.839
what do you mean george sanford

2618.839 --> 2624.88
oh right yeah creation design

2621.839 --> 2628.7999999999997
absolutely there is no coincidence

2624.88 --> 2631.52
random does not exist it's a concept

2628.8 --> 2632.079
literally it's a virtual concept that

2631.52 --> 2635.68
does

2632.079 --> 2639.6400000000003
not exist in reality

2635.68 --> 2642.7999999999997
chaos random is the

2639.64 --> 2646.319
misunderstanding of

2642.8 --> 2648.6400000000003
the order that actually exists there

2646.319 --> 2651.2799999999997
you just don't see it so it's chaos to

2648.64 --> 2653.04
you you have no oversight chaos is not

2651.28 --> 2656.2400000000002
having oversight that is

2653.04 --> 2663.14
what it is and it is the only thing

2656.24 --> 2666.2299999999996
that it is

2663.14 --> 2666.23
[Music]

2683.119 --> 2688.319
right chaos and randomness is for the

2686.079 --> 2692.2400000000002
vacated

2688.319 --> 2696.56
it's only worth something to those

2692.24 --> 2698.359
that consider having oversight

2696.56 --> 2700.96
as a burden because of the

2698.359 --> 2702.4
responsibility that comes automatically

2700.96 --> 2705.599
with the insight

2702.4 --> 2706.319
and they don't want that so then they

2705.599 --> 2710.0
see it as

2706.319 --> 2714.16
chaos instead they reject the order

2710.0 --> 2716.24
that is there that is what it is

2714.16 --> 2718.3999999999996
that's these people that thinks it's

2716.24 --> 2722.0
cool chaos priest

2718.4 --> 2725.2000000000003
that [ __ ] right chaos priests

2722.0 --> 2729.119
yeah it's called opposing

2725.2 --> 2729.1189999999997
the order that exists

2730.079 --> 2736.7200000000003
it's not cool it's not

2733.119 --> 2740.6400000000003
smart it's literally

2736.72 --> 2743.839
dumb it's born from

2740.64 --> 2747.04
stupidity willing stupidity

2743.839 --> 2749.7599999999998
with most of them although yeah

2747.04 --> 2752.0
eventually most of these people do catch

2749.76 --> 2752.0
on

2752.88 --> 2758.4
it often starts almost like a game-like

2755.359 --> 2758.4
fantasy approach

2758.56 --> 2762.64
and then yeah when they figure out that

2760.56 --> 2765.599
life is a little bit more serious than

2762.64 --> 2768.8799999999997
just a bunch of stupid fantasy games

2765.599 --> 2772.839
then they might be

2768.88 --> 2775.839
sensible enough to abandon that stupid

2772.839 --> 2779.599
approach

2775.839 --> 2789.839
anyway i'm yeah this is a bit of a

2779.599 --> 2789.839
show is a bit over the place

2799.92 --> 2808.319
no no nicholas riddle you're wrong

2803.52 --> 2811.68
you're completely wrong nature

2808.319 --> 2815.7599999999998
is something that came forth from

2811.68 --> 2816.7999999999997
god did not come forth from creation

2815.76 --> 2820.88
nature came

2816.8 --> 2824.079
forth from creation god

2820.88 --> 2826.8
was the antecedent to

2824.079 --> 2826.8
creation

2827.119 --> 2833.92
he is creation

2831.2 --> 2833.9199999999996
do you understand

2834.48 --> 2837.52
you can't replace god with nature

2837.04 --> 2841.2
because

2837.52 --> 2844.079
nature came out of creation

2841.2 --> 2847.359
it did not make anything it manifested

2844.079 --> 2847.3590000000004
according to a design

2854.4 --> 2861.599
a dynamic design but

2857.52 --> 2864.72
a design absolutely in

2861.599 --> 2867.2000000000003
you can't oppose that

2864.72 --> 2872.16
so much design about it in so many ways

2867.2 --> 2874.0789999999997
it's absurd

2872.16 --> 2877.839
yeah i bet you were a purple rockstar

2874.079 --> 2880.8
chaos has been extremely popularized

2877.839 --> 2882.5589999999997
like through the goth [ __ ] situation

2880.8 --> 2884.7200000000003
through gaming

2882.559 --> 2885.8390000000004
through anything chaos it's all about

2884.72 --> 2889.04
the chaos oh

2885.839 --> 2892.72
chaos you know the circle with the eight

2889.04 --> 2897.04
arrows outside yeah

2892.72 --> 2899.9199999999996
so cool so this is so different

2897.04 --> 2901.52
yeah yeah it's just another form of

2899.92 --> 2906.0
satanism it's covert

2901.52 --> 2908.48
satanism it's opposition to order which

2906.0 --> 2909.28
is the creation it's literally the

2908.48 --> 2912.319
design

2909.28 --> 2915.76
the creation order

2912.319 --> 2929.839
the unfathomable deep order

2915.76 --> 2929.8390000000004
of all things there is no chaos

2952.24 --> 2961.2
no it did not come from nothing

2957.599 --> 2961.2000000000003
nothing has come from nothing

2961.359 --> 2964.88
god always was

2965.92 --> 2973.04
he's there he was there he

2969.119 --> 2977.76
is there and time

2973.04 --> 2980.88
followed him not the other way around

2977.76 --> 2981.28
and when time follows you yeah if you

2980.88 --> 2983.44
link

2981.28 --> 2984.7200000000003
think about that logically that means

2983.44 --> 2988.319
it's always

2984.72 --> 2988.319
there it always has been

2991.359 --> 2994.72
something is there and then time starts

2993.599 --> 2997.599
running that means

2994.72 --> 2998.0789999999997
it's always there it has always been

2997.599 --> 3001.6800000000003
there

2998.079 --> 3001.6800000000003
and it will always be there

3004.88 --> 3012.319
yeah and physicality you know

3008.8 --> 3016.48
first there is god then became

3012.319 --> 3018.68
a physical realm then

3016.48 --> 3021.86
time and entropy

3018.68 --> 3021.8599999999997
[Music]

3024.839 --> 3030.5589999999997
right

3026.8 --> 3041.8390000000004
how about just logic

3030.559 --> 3041.8390000000004
logic nicholas real

3044.8 --> 3048.48
yeah well in imaginary being you say

3048.079 --> 3051.6800000000003
wait

3048.48 --> 3054.319
you you think that we and

3051.68 --> 3056.24
i'm going to now make you address me

3054.319 --> 3058.079
you're not having a conversation with

3056.24 --> 3059.839
anybody else out there nicholas riddle

3058.079 --> 3063.599
i'm addressing you that means

3059.839 --> 3066.0
you address me back and you'll not

3063.599 --> 3067.599
deviate onto a conversation with the

3066.0 --> 3068.0
other person even though you might have

3067.599 --> 3071.04
started

3068.0 --> 3073.28
out with that just to clear that up all

3071.04 --> 3073.2799999999997
right

3074.559 --> 3083.6800000000003
god is not an imaginary being you cannot

3079.599 --> 3087.28
think up an alternative imaginary being

3083.68 --> 3091.52
god is not a thing god is

3087.28 --> 3095.6800000000003
all things all things

3091.52 --> 3098.72
literally alpha and the omega

3095.68 --> 3102.3999999999996
he was there before time existed

3098.72 --> 3106.48
he was there before physicality existed

3102.4 --> 3109.92
all things not a imaginary

3106.48 --> 3113.119
or non-imaginary being being

3109.92 --> 3116.48
implies separate existence

3113.119 --> 3124.67
that is not god god is all

3116.48 --> 3128.079
things all things no exception

3124.67 --> 3130.64
[Music]

3128.079 --> 3132.96
even your unwillingness to admit to the

3130.64 --> 3132.96
truth

3133.04 --> 3139.2799999999997
could be categorized as information

3136.16 --> 3144.3999999999996
that is natural consequence

3139.28 --> 3144.4
to existence as decreed per god

3146.04 --> 3149.2799999999997
[Music]

3150.839 --> 3154.72
design

3152.72 --> 3156.319
right so i'm gonna round out the show

3154.72 --> 3161.1189999999997
now

3156.319 --> 3163.599
thanks everyone for coming yeah it is

3161.119 --> 3163.599
it is

3164.48 --> 3171.359
it is yeah god is

3168.24 --> 3172.0789999999997
all things because i say so and if you

3171.359 --> 3175.119
disagree

3172.079 --> 3177.44
you can [ __ ] off because it is it's

3175.119 --> 3181.6800000000003
decreed it's said

3177.44 --> 3185.44
it's described everywhere everywhere

3181.68 --> 3189.44
in the core of it religion spirits

3185.44 --> 3193.28
avatars yeah guess what it comes down to

3189.44 --> 3196.7200000000003
all things that is the creator

3193.28 --> 3200.8
all things it's not because i

3196.72 --> 3200.7999999999997
say so it is because it is

3204.4 --> 3208.0
right anyway thanks everyone for coming

3207.04 --> 3209.68
if you like the show

3208.0 --> 3212.0
then please don't forget the rogans and

3209.68 --> 3214.96
up and if you don't then

3212.0 --> 3216.0
i don't give a [ __ ] just piss off

3214.96 --> 3217.839
whatever downfall

3216.0 --> 3220.839
i don't give a [ __ ] you know the whole

3217.839 --> 3224.24
system is rigged the entire show is so

3220.839 --> 3226.48
rigged it's just ridiculous

3224.24 --> 3228.0789999999997
and the thing is it does not make me

3226.48 --> 3230.96
look ridiculous

3228.079 --> 3232.7200000000003
it just makes youtube look really

3230.96 --> 3237.359
[ __ ] dubious

3232.72 --> 3240.5589999999997
really creepy creepy

3237.359 --> 3240.5589999999997
creepy policy

3240.8 --> 3246.28
like corporatizing and extinguishing the

3244.079 --> 3249.28
freedoms of others

3246.28 --> 3250.7200000000003
manipulating statistics literally

3249.28 --> 3254.1600000000003
