yeah dead broke by Monday

so

98.52 --> 101.479
time of the month

102.0 --> 105.38
please support me guys

105.479 --> 108.17999999999999
uh

106.86 --> 109.979
all right

108.18 --> 113.42
anyway the weather

109.979 --> 113.42
is great

115.74 --> 118.28
beautiful

119.64 --> 124.2
Clear Blue Skies with a couple of nice

122.939 --> 127.13999999999999
white

124.2 --> 130.379
fluffy clouds

127.14 --> 134.239
a bit of wind but it's nah not a lot

130.379 --> 134.239
and it's just really nice and warm

138.72 --> 146.819
unlike in Scotland apparently

143.7 --> 150.92
because earlier Dell had like this very

146.819 --> 150.92
short little straight up

152.12 --> 157.44
foreign was showing that the weather

155.04 --> 159.72
just really sucked

157.44 --> 163.62
so

159.72 --> 165.72
I hope that turns around for you Dale

163.62 --> 167.94
I know you're living in Scotland and

165.72 --> 170.7
also you should be expecting more rain

167.94 --> 173.76
than average but

170.7 --> 176.22
even Scotland deserves

173.76 --> 179.42
a nice weather day

176.22 --> 179.42
every now and then

181.14 --> 192.35999999999999
right so hello psych bear first in chat

186.3 --> 192.36
it is Saturday the 11th of June 2022.

197.04 --> 201.44
I'm feeling pretty good much better than

199.2 --> 201.44
yesterday

210.2 --> 216.23899999999998
raining in West Virginia okay

214.08 --> 218.42000000000002
hey Neil the rest ice and lies good to

216.239 --> 218.42000000000002
see you

226.319 --> 232.819
so I'm feeling pretty good despite my

228.599 --> 232.819
financial situation being not too great

232.86 --> 237.56
I'm going to try to use that as much as

235.2 --> 237.56
I can

240.18 --> 245.4
I thought yesterday's show was pretty

241.92 --> 248.28
good I haven't actually watched it back

245.4 --> 250.70000000000002
but yeah I was well I watched a little

248.28 --> 250.7
bit back

251.58 --> 256.79900000000004
but it was nice it was nice to basically

253.92 --> 258.53999999999996
have a theme of the show

256.799 --> 261.239
and

258.54 --> 263.759
yeah I was very impressed by seeking

261.239 --> 266.63899999999995
star Waters Tarot deck

263.759 --> 270.84000000000003
first impressions

266.639 --> 273.6
and it worked like as I I'm very good at

270.84 --> 277.5
handling tarot cards I I don't make it

273.6 --> 280.68
my profession but maybe it's because I

277.5 --> 283.68
don't do it very often that it just

280.68 --> 285.90000000000003
works really well for me

283.68 --> 288.18
anyway

285.9 --> 289.85999999999996
uh Flat Earth debate yesterday was also

288.18 --> 293.94
good

289.86 --> 297.36
was a really long show with the after

293.94 --> 298.68
show like four more hours type of show

297.36 --> 303.18
so

298.68 --> 306.12
we'll probably see it back Sunday

303.18 --> 308.34000000000003
maybe Monday I don't know

306.12 --> 311.72
but uh

308.34 --> 311.71999999999997
yeah that was a great show

313.56 --> 319.919
oh watch it you it was epic I'm very

316.08 --> 320.94
glad you you liked it I I I did do my

319.919 --> 323.21999999999997
best

320.94 --> 325.94
and like

323.22 --> 329.639
like I did do my best without like

325.94 --> 331.8
withholding information right because I

329.639 --> 333.18
I tried to give some like criticism

331.8 --> 335.52000000000004
points

333.18 --> 337.979
like with the production right because

335.52 --> 340.79999999999995
those things do matter for you it's not

337.979 --> 343.56
like oh no it's not good enough but it's

340.8 --> 347.039
just like you need to know that right

343.56 --> 349.44
as a producer so I hope some of the tips

347.039 --> 352.919
helped and yeah

349.44 --> 355.08
like the work that you did

352.919 --> 359.35999999999996
the art and just the things you wrote

355.08 --> 359.35999999999996
down yeah it's it's good I like it

360.66 --> 363.199
it's

364.02 --> 368.639
it has like a lot of like condensed

366.479 --> 371.58
energy it's like very

368.639 --> 373.44
impression enthusiastic

371.58 --> 376.56
Young

373.44 --> 378.96
a bit wild but I kind of liked it

376.56 --> 380.94
like it is yeah I don't know I haven't

378.96 --> 383.15999999999997
really even tested it out

380.94 --> 386.21999999999997
to elaborate like you would have to do

383.16 --> 389.16
that more to really figure it out and

386.22 --> 391.02000000000004
I'm I'm gonna show it to my stepmother

389.16 --> 394.08000000000004
who is like

391.02 --> 396.18
totally into tarot she was like what is

394.08 --> 398.35999999999996
it 50 different types of decks and all

396.18 --> 398.36
that

398.46 --> 403.31899999999996
so I'm definitely gonna show it to her

400.8 --> 404.639
and hear her out on her impressions

403.319 --> 407.24
about it

404.639 --> 407.24
ah

408.0 --> 411.24
yo I will get the next oh wow really

410.039 --> 414.9
seeking

411.24 --> 417.0
I would be on there I mean

414.9 --> 418.31899999999996
I'm not demanding it or anything I mean

417.0 --> 420.919
this is

418.319 --> 420.91900000000004
good

421.44 --> 428.039
but yeah if if you're gonna

424.5 --> 430.62
have a the next Edition yeah I sure I

428.039 --> 434.759
would would be great to have it

430.62 --> 436.139
uh what channel of Nathan's is the after

434.759 --> 440.22
show on

436.139 --> 443.759
uh it's on Nathan Oakley Channel

440.22 --> 446.03900000000004
I think sidewear did you not know that

443.759 --> 447.599
Nathan Oakley has two channels Nathan

446.039 --> 450.539
Oakley 1980

447.599 --> 451.74
and one single sentence and Nathan

450.539 --> 454.139
Oakley

451.74 --> 457.62
that's like his second Channel

454.139 --> 460.62
I think that's where he plays the uh

457.62 --> 460.62
the premieres

462.419 --> 465.139
or is it

466.62 --> 471.0
yeah

468.78 --> 474.35999999999996
sometimes he also just plays premieres

471.0 --> 476.699
on his Nathan Oakley 1980 channel for

474.36 --> 479.16
some reason but

476.699 --> 481.02000000000004
as far as I've

479.16 --> 485.3
yeah the most premieres he does for

481.02 --> 485.29999999999995
Nathan Oakley Channel which is separate

487.44 --> 491.819
should be able to find the link on his

489.479 --> 494.65999999999997
Nathan Oakley 1980 Channel

491.819 --> 494.66

letter Sage

615.24 --> 621.019
and Greta chat tonight what are you

618.0 --> 621.019
talking about Jadu

636.36 --> 644.7
foreign

639.24 --> 644.7
[Music]

659.1 --> 662.1
where

665.459 --> 668.66
great chat where

676.14 --> 679.579
great interaction okay

681.54 --> 686.9399999999999
can you be a bit more specific though I

684.899 --> 690.5
mean my chat seems to be just rolling

686.94 --> 690.5
out fine today so

691.579 --> 696.4799999999999
I by the way also think it might have

694.14 --> 698.64
been partially me

696.48 --> 701.04
that thinks

698.64 --> 703.5
in like the last few weeks that I got

701.04 --> 707.399
kind of impatient and all that

703.5 --> 709.56
because I tried to do I basically tried

707.399 --> 712.92
to lay it down

709.56 --> 717.54
and you guys it seems to be working

712.92 --> 720.36
right so I was kind of like I don't know

717.54 --> 722.88
keeping my foot in between a door that

720.36 --> 724.74
really should have just been shot

722.88 --> 725.9399999999999
so it could be reopened again or

724.74 --> 728.82
something right

725.94 --> 731.519
it's like keeping your foot

728.82 --> 734.4590000000001
in between an electronic door

731.519 --> 737.279
like it can't open unless it closes

734.459 --> 740.279
first like that kind of situation so

737.279 --> 742.56
yeah I got my foot out of there

740.279 --> 745.5
and hopefully things will get rolling

742.56 --> 749.06
again although yeah I might still have

745.5 --> 749.06
Financial issues because

758.22 --> 763.6800000000001
I'm glad I've made it in the past so

761.22 --> 765.9590000000001
hopefully I will make it again

763.68 --> 770.3
with enough people

765.959 --> 770.3
helping me out through PayPal

770.59 --> 773.739
[Music]

779.04 --> 782.76
they're hanging here for days lots of

780.899 --> 786.54
rain there um

782.76 --> 790.68
well it's been raining here

786.54 --> 792.3199999999999
like up to like roughly uh this is now a

790.68 --> 795.3599999999999
few days ago

792.32 --> 797.6
but like three weeks ago it was like

795.36 --> 801.0
really bad rain for a week

797.6 --> 803.519
heavy constantly

801.0 --> 805.92
and then it kind of stopped and now it's

803.519 --> 809.24
been kind of nice weather for the last

805.92 --> 809.24
two three days

810.839 --> 815.82
so maybe you're you're now all getting

813.839 --> 818.519
the bad weather or well the rain it's

815.82 --> 820.1990000000001
not necessarily bad to have rain

818.519 --> 823.639
maybe you're now getting some of that

820.199 --> 823.639
over there in the US

827.65 --> 830.8199999999999
[Music]

846.42 --> 849.079
hmm

849.959 --> 852.56
thank you

852.959 --> 856.279
Arc is flooding

868.56 --> 872.5189999999999
I've I've been like

870.6 --> 876.3000000000001
legally seeing

872.519 --> 878.88
like U.S flooding footage but I wasn't

876.3 --> 879.66
sure like even what it was about it just

878.88 --> 882.38
like

879.66 --> 882.38
click

883.139 --> 888.0600000000001
scroll past it or something but

886.079 --> 891.8599999999999
apparently there is like a lot of heavy

888.06 --> 891.8599999999999
rain now in certain places in the US

913.62 --> 916.22
foreign

920.08 --> 923.4590000000001
[Music]

927.66 --> 930.38
you mean

941.88 --> 948.899
right but yeah I don't know

945.24 --> 950.88
look whoever's in control over like

948.899 --> 955.019
whether

950.88 --> 957.8389999999999
in the US is like obviously not doing

955.019 --> 960.12
all that great a job and probably on

957.839 --> 963.12
purpose

960.12 --> 965.759
because I can imagine that it would be

963.12 --> 967.139
very easy to just like basically

965.759 --> 969.6
redirect

967.139 --> 973.5
entire

969.6 --> 976.1990000000001
like rainfronts to other regions to like

973.5 --> 978.48
migrate them I could imagine that that's

976.199 --> 981.199
a possibility right

978.48 --> 981.1990000000001
so

982.44 --> 987.36
but it seems like every time there's

984.72 --> 990.62
weather things in the U.S like it it's

987.36 --> 990.62
just always bad

992.459 --> 998.899
like weather management just seems to be

994.74 --> 998.899
very bad over there specifically

999.6 --> 1003.6990000000001
going to have to wait for the monsoons

1019.16 --> 1022.54
hey we just seen it

1022.579 --> 1025.579
foreign

1029.76 --> 1032.91
[Music]

1050.919 --> 1055.94
there was something weird

1054.08 --> 1059.96
right

1055.94 --> 1062.1200000000001
yesterday I mean like the show early

1059.96 --> 1064.88
bird show reviewing the deck and all

1062.12 --> 1067.28
that that was like really cool but then

1064.88 --> 1070.96
like the last minute like this really

1067.28 --> 1070.96
[ __ ] up troll came in

1071.299 --> 1077.78
and like he kind of ruined it for me

1075.5 --> 1080.24
it's like almost embarrassing to admit

1077.78 --> 1083.299
but like yeah

1080.24 --> 1086.419
I've taken note

1083.299 --> 1088.52
because he like totally ruined my mood

1086.419 --> 1091.039
like in the last minute

1088.52 --> 1093.02
after having a great show and in like

1091.039 --> 1097.7
that kind of

1093.02 --> 1100.22
held on for like two hours almost

1097.7 --> 1101.6000000000001
and I'm just surprised that one little

1100.22 --> 1104.539
[ __ ]

1101.6 --> 1106.2199999999998
is able to do that

1104.539 --> 1109.7
also that

1106.22 --> 1113.3600000000001
I do realize why though because it was

1109.7 --> 1115.28
basically like a mega satanic gamma

1113.36 --> 1118.9399999999998
attack what he was doing

1115.28 --> 1123.3799999999999
because he was lying about what he said

1118.94 --> 1126.799
he had is all a lie it's no person that

1123.38 --> 1129.98
has that kind of those kind of jobs and

1126.799 --> 1132.86
possessions and all that is going to

1129.98 --> 1135.38
behave like that so he had to be a liar

1132.86 --> 1137.6
but because I was just kind of in a

1135.38 --> 1139.8200000000002
trusting mood

1137.6 --> 1142.8799999999999
like having a good time

1139.82 --> 1143.72
seeking star Waters cards also kind of

1142.88 --> 1147.2600000000002
like

1143.72 --> 1149.72
they have like this trusting frequency

1147.26 --> 1152.78
I kind of fell for that

1149.72 --> 1155.1200000000001
Trixie of his I took him serious and

1152.78 --> 1158.8999999999999
that totally like totally ruined my my

1155.12 --> 1161.7199999999998
mood like really bad all of a sudden

1158.9 --> 1164.0590000000002
like a certain feedback

1161.72 --> 1168.82
Spike

1164.059 --> 1168.82
weird weird how that happened

1172.28 --> 1177.44
right but I just wanted to tell you like

1174.98 --> 1178.94
I recognized like he had to have been

1177.44 --> 1181.28
lying

1178.94 --> 1183.679
about everything he was saying like he

1181.28 --> 1187.82
was suggesting oh

1183.679 --> 1190.5800000000002
Arwin you're so poor and stupid enough

1187.82 --> 1193.039
you know how that goes but then also

1190.58 --> 1194.4189999999999
suggesting like oh no I have farm and I

1193.039 --> 1197.72
have land and

1194.419 --> 1200.7990000000002
but kids and like I'm totally crushing

1197.72 --> 1205.1000000000001
it's like no way

1200.799 --> 1206.6
dude no way I just

1205.1 --> 1210.1999999999998
I was

1206.6 --> 1213.1399999999999
caught flat-footed spiritually so I

1210.2 --> 1216.02
couldn't immediately point it out and

1213.14 --> 1218.7990000000002
alter my response

1216.02 --> 1218.799
really weird

1223.1 --> 1228.039
but it's just kind of telling that

1225.08 --> 1231.3799999999999
there's like really [ __ ] up people

1228.039 --> 1234.62
like really nasty

1231.38 --> 1239.8400000000001
that are just like

1234.62 --> 1243.799
they are like imps but really evil is

1239.84 --> 1246.559
and they will just do that like

1243.799 --> 1248.78
Reckless little demons

1246.559 --> 1251.72
that just have this kind of like micro

1248.78 --> 1254.059
superpowers and it is all completely

1251.72 --> 1256.46
wasted on nothing

1254.059 --> 1258.2
it's all to their own detriment but yet

1256.46 --> 1261.08
they insist

1258.2 --> 1264.6200000000001
they insist that they do that

1261.08 --> 1269.0
makes me really kind of start burning up

1264.62 --> 1272.08
inside and get like how do we take care

1269.0 --> 1272.08
of these people

1272.419 --> 1279.919
yeah with a very wide range of

1276.5 --> 1282.919
interpretation as to what taking care of

1279.919 --> 1282.919
implies

1284.84 --> 1290.36
because this is like a serious disease

1288.08 --> 1293.4399999999998
of the mind that's going around that

1290.36 --> 1298.1
there's people that are just in the

1293.44 --> 1301.179
ability of doing that and it's all just

1298.1 --> 1301.1789999999999
being allowed to happen

1302.059 --> 1306.98
right and then oh but what the

1304.64 --> 1310.22
government no no I'm not talking about

1306.98 --> 1313.22
like government not talking about legal

1310.22 --> 1317.5
[ __ ] I'm talking about spiritual stuff

1313.22 --> 1321.26
talking about these people are like that

1317.5 --> 1323.6
why are they treated like normal people

1321.26 --> 1326.24
they're not normal people if you're like

1323.6 --> 1328.8799999999999
that you're not a normal person and you

1326.24 --> 1331.88
have a different frequency you should be

1328.88 --> 1331.88
ostracized

1332.419 --> 1338.419
right

1334.039 --> 1341.419
but not like Beyond just your personal

1338.419 --> 1341.419
interaction

1343.22 --> 1349.159
because

1344.299 --> 1349.1589999999999
these people are like diseased

1353.419 --> 1360.5
and you know that they seek out darkness

1356.9 --> 1362.0590000000002
and the demoralizing things and like

1360.5 --> 1364.82
they like that

1362.059 --> 1369.3799999999999
so they're going to like play into that

1364.82 --> 1372.6789999999999
and potentially even help causing it

1369.38 --> 1375.4
like their vote might be a vote of evil

1372.679 --> 1375.4
you see

1381.62 --> 1386.539
if they have anything beyond just

1384.32 --> 1389.78
bluffing that is

1386.539 --> 1394.1589999999999
but just like the tenacity

1389.78 --> 1396.26
of the evil focus is just like

1394.159 --> 1399.7990000000002
no

1396.26 --> 1400.82
like normal [ __ ] would be able to do

1399.799 --> 1405.9189999999999
that

1400.82 --> 1408.6789999999999
that has to be real evil in people

1405.919 --> 1410.7800000000002
and that's it's dangerous it's a

1408.679 --> 1412.76
dangerous sign like I find it like

1410.78 --> 1415.28
disturbing

1412.76 --> 1416.96
that there's just people around that do

1415.28 --> 1420.6399999999999
that

1416.96 --> 1420.64
and that it's tolerated

1421.52 --> 1424.36
foreign

1425.38 --> 1429.64
it or something right

1429.86 --> 1433.82
like

1431.12 --> 1436.58
I mean yeah you can avoid people you

1433.82 --> 1438.98
don't respond to them and all that but

1436.58 --> 1442.34
if they just keep on going and they just

1438.98 --> 1445.1
Vine find more vulnerable people to then

1442.34 --> 1447.74
parasite on and disrupt

1445.1 --> 1449.84
well you turning your back on them and

1447.74 --> 1452.419
not being involved and not being touched

1449.84 --> 1454.279
by it well there's people that might not

1452.419 --> 1457.64
be too strong

1454.279 --> 1459.799
at that or they might be just happen to

1457.64 --> 1461.96
have to be in the really vulnerable

1459.799 --> 1464.96
position in their life and they're gonna

1461.96 --> 1469.46
get parasited on right

1464.96 --> 1471.74
so just turning your back on it

1469.46 --> 1474.44
is not really a long-term solution

1471.74 --> 1477.32
because the amount of people that do

1474.44 --> 1479.419
that are growing in numbers

1477.32 --> 1482.24
over the decades

1479.419 --> 1485.72
and this is a dangerous development

1482.24 --> 1488.84
because they have no limitations to

1485.72 --> 1491.419
their application of evil you see

1488.84 --> 1494.0
they grow in numbers

1491.419 --> 1496.64
just turning your vacuum is not going to

1494.0 --> 1499.279
suffice because it it's not stopping the

1496.64 --> 1501.7990000000002
growing in numbers you see

1499.279 --> 1504.38
this is a really dangerous development

1501.799 --> 1506.539
in my opinion and I've been like right

1504.38 --> 1510.88
head front facing it

1506.539 --> 1510.8799999999999
facing the spirit of it

1512.299 --> 1517.9
all right so I yeah

1515.12 --> 1517.8999999999999
hopefully

1519.38 --> 1523.1000000000001
that makes a little arrive like that

1521.48 --> 1525.38
really rough ending of the yesterday

1523.1 --> 1528.4399999999998
show which I didn't like

1525.38 --> 1531.7990000000002
like I wish I would cut that off the

1528.44 --> 1533.6000000000001
video but I don't do that you see and it

1531.799 --> 1536.36
has a purpose and now

1533.6 --> 1540.3799999999999
I fulfilled that purpose by laying down

1536.36 --> 1544.3999999999999
a really elaborate explanation about it

1540.38 --> 1546.7990000000002
about what what that was because I would

1544.4 --> 1549.5
deleted it right I'd banned him very

1546.799 --> 1551.4189999999999
quickly so you didn't get to see even

1549.5 --> 1553.7
how he wrote the message so you're gonna

1551.419 --> 1555.38
have to like trust me on my memory of it

1553.7 --> 1558.1000000000001
now

1555.38 --> 1558.1000000000001
uh

1560.419 --> 1565.159
that's right all that need for evil to

1563.539 --> 1566.419
Triumph is for good men to do nothing

1565.159 --> 1569.3600000000001
right

1566.419 --> 1572.1200000000001
so turning your back on it with your

1569.36 --> 1574.039
personal frequency is basically only a

1572.12 --> 1577.1
first step

1574.039 --> 1580.279
it's the shield you put up

1577.1 --> 1582.6999999999998
but just putting up a shield really is

1580.279 --> 1582.7
not enough

1582.919 --> 1585.4
right

1585.44 --> 1591.679
like if they can't hit you

1588.44 --> 1595.039
then they'll just retreat

1591.679 --> 1596.48
and recruit other people or get the

1595.039 --> 1599.419
people that don't put up their Shield

1596.48 --> 1602.02
you see and yeah

1599.419 --> 1602.0200000000002
spread

1602.659 --> 1608.0800000000002
spread the evil

1604.94 --> 1608.0800000000002
spread the misery

1610.039 --> 1616.1589999999999
who are you talking no I'm talking about

1612.34 --> 1618.32
a really nasty spirit

1616.159 --> 1619.8200000000002
in certain type of people and certain

1618.32 --> 1622.3999999999999
type of trolls

1619.82 --> 1625.82
right but it's not just one individual

1622.4 --> 1627.74
and they're like always anonymous

1625.82 --> 1631.12
they will always stay Anonymous and

1627.74 --> 1631.1200000000001
could be a whole range of people

1635.419 --> 1640.8200000000002
and

1637.34 --> 1644.1789999999999
it's like sometimes

1640.82 --> 1645.26
I base a lot of those types of in my

1644.179 --> 1649.5800000000002
chat

1645.26 --> 1652.94
fortunately and when I do I really treat

1649.58 --> 1654.86
them as if they were One Singular person

1652.94 --> 1656.1200000000001
and this works really well for me

1654.86 --> 1659.0
because

1656.12 --> 1661.76
the frequency is the same and when

1659.0 --> 1664.7
people do that double down on that then

1661.76 --> 1667.52
that frequency is going to have a lot of

1664.7 --> 1670.76
tentacles and grasp on their life

1667.52 --> 1674.12
so to basically

1670.76 --> 1677.12
approach them as a singular person is

1674.12 --> 1680.299
really not that unwise because they will

1677.12 --> 1683.12
have those elements in their life

1680.299 --> 1685.34
because of that frequency because of

1683.12 --> 1687.9799999999998
where they are at

1685.34 --> 1692.24
so I literally don't even have to treat

1687.98 --> 1694.46
them as individuals to get it correct

1692.24 --> 1697.3990000000001
right now that's telling that there is

1694.46 --> 1700.82
an evil spirit to it if you don't even

1697.399 --> 1705.1589999999999
have to account for the individual

1700.82 --> 1705.1589999999999
and that it works out your approach

1712.22 --> 1718.48
your Yoda lesson for today

1715.82 --> 1718.48
foreign

1736.779 --> 1741.38
so yeah if you're gonna

1739.34 --> 1744.1399999999999
put up a shield

1741.38 --> 1746.2990000000002
a shield against troll he trolls then

1744.14 --> 1748.8200000000002
you better make sure you're gonna learn

1746.299 --> 1751.4189999999999
how to Shield Bash

1748.82 --> 1751.4189999999999
right

1755.36 --> 1762.26
don't just hold it up and take the blows

1758.179 --> 1765.919
no learn the time and then Bang

1762.26 --> 1767.419
or like push him over with it right just

1765.919 --> 1770.96
trample them

1767.419 --> 1773.38
or do like a shield SmackDown

1770.96 --> 1773.38
question

1773.899 --> 1778.36
Shields are not just for defense

1778.64 --> 1783.2
dude depending on your design you can

1780.62 --> 1785.6589999999999
literally have like a shield that it can

1783.2 --> 1789.039
also function as as like a sort of stab

1785.659 --> 1789.0390000000002
weapon even so

1789.5 --> 1792.58
on the pens

1806.5 --> 1813.2
right and that Shield bashing that is

1810.62 --> 1815.779
partially my aggression

1813.2 --> 1819.26
when facing a troll

1815.779 --> 1821.6
right I am like pretty extraordinarily

1819.26 --> 1823.82
aggressive all of a sudden

1821.6 --> 1826.58
and I know that to some people that's

1823.82 --> 1828.6789999999999
like really off-putting almost like what

1826.58 --> 1831.08
the [ __ ] this guy's like a psychopath or

1828.679 --> 1833.72
something and I get it it is very

1831.08 --> 1836.299
off-putting even watching it back

1833.72 --> 1839.3600000000001
especially if you don't have a real grip

1836.299 --> 1841.039
on the contacts as to why it's like this

1839.36 --> 1843.1999999999998
guy is [ __ ]

1841.039 --> 1845.299
but it is me

1843.2 --> 1849.38
certainly bringing out my shield and

1845.299 --> 1853.1
just bang bang bang bang bang bang

1849.38 --> 1856.8200000000002
like you gotta kill it immediately

1853.1 --> 1858.86
like not a second's room like instant

1856.82 --> 1862.72
kill it

1858.86 --> 1862.7199999999998
and that's just how I do it

1870.279 --> 1876.26
yeah you are a little that's fine

1873.62 --> 1880.2199999999998
it's all fine

1876.26 --> 1884.36
you don't have to be oh no

1880.22 --> 1888.019
dude just don't tell me that I that I

1884.36 --> 1891.1999999999998
don't know like my own sensories as long

1888.019 --> 1894.86
as you respect my ability

1891.2 --> 1897.26
right you can point out or even joke

1894.86 --> 1901.84
about rates

1897.26 --> 1901.84
that I have that's all fine

1909.5 --> 1917.86
with a sworn what is that a swore you

1913.279 --> 1917.86
mean a sword right right it's like where

1919.399 --> 1923.32
yeah sword Maybe

1924.2 --> 1929.1200000000001
but

1925.82 --> 1930.4399999999998
yeah I don't know I like Shield bashing

1929.12 --> 1932.84
really

1930.44 --> 1935.1200000000001
also because

1932.84 --> 1938.299
if you just have one guy with the shield

1935.12 --> 1940.6999999999998
then opponents did oh he's unarmed he

1938.299 --> 1943.6
only has the shield yeah yeah I only

1940.7 --> 1943.6000000000001
have The Shield

1944.799 --> 1950.72
I'm only having that Shield yeah

1948.14 --> 1953.72
right this is

1950.72 --> 1953.72
yes

1954.62 --> 1959.9189999999999
well if he sees me with a sword then he

1957.08 --> 1959.9189999999999
might be like oh

1960.2 --> 1964.76
maybe I have to like actually bring a

1962.72 --> 1968.74
sword too then and then it's not gonna

1964.76 --> 1968.74
be as simple anyway yes

2006.82 --> 2011.98
how about a shield and a hook

2009.88 --> 2013.8990000000001
if I get like a really heavy Shield

2011.98 --> 2015.3990000000001
that's like pretty thick steel it was

2013.899 --> 2018.539
gonna be freaking heavy yeah it's going

2015.399 --> 2018.539
to be less flexible then

2019.299 --> 2023.3799999999999
with a hook

2020.86 --> 2025.059
like in the hand that you can literally

2023.38 --> 2027.7
just like

2025.059 --> 2030.7
like hold up your Shield tackle the

2027.7 --> 2034.0800000000002
opponent and then literally just like

2030.7 --> 2034.0800000000002
crush him with the shield

2034.96 --> 2038.92
uh

2035.81 --> 2038.9199999999998
[Music]

2047.38 --> 2052.78
that's what you get when I watch when I

2050.44 --> 2054.579
like look through my DND book again with

2052.78 --> 2057.639
like all the weapons and all that

2054.579 --> 2060.3390000000004
because yeah Shield bashing is a thing

2057.639 --> 2063.04
there's like special features

2060.339 --> 2065.7999999999997
like special ability or yeah

2063.04 --> 2068.5
special skills you could say

2065.8 --> 2070.0
things you could do with that that you

2068.5 --> 2072.04
can attain even

2070.0 --> 2074.879
as a combat tear

2072.04 --> 2074.879
it's fighter

2075.159 --> 2080.2200000000003
or Paladin is very typical that they use

2077.5 --> 2080.22
their Shields

2095.139 --> 2098.44
most of those enemies who get bashed by

2097.359 --> 2100.359
The Shield

2098.44 --> 2102.4
wouldn't even see it that's right

2100.359 --> 2103.839
exactly

2102.4 --> 2106.42
because

2103.839 --> 2110.68
you don't expect that from a shield

2106.42 --> 2113.38
right it's like oh it's just a wall it's

2110.68 --> 2115.7799999999997
hard to get through yeah unless somebody

2113.38 --> 2118.599
also learns how to use it as a weapon

2115.78 --> 2119.579
and then suddenly

2118.599 --> 2122.5
um

2119.579 --> 2124.92
unexpected things might happen if you

2122.5 --> 2124.92
approach

2124.96 --> 2129.66
were you ever no I was never in the Army

2127.48 --> 2129.66
no

2139.359 --> 2145.119
I was a bit tempted to

2142.599 --> 2147.4
but afterward I'm really glad I didn't

2145.119 --> 2151.44
because then I would have probably been

2147.4 --> 2151.44
involved in like all that garbage

2152.5 --> 2159.16
if I've even like got through it I mean

2155.44 --> 2162.04
I am not like the most

2159.16 --> 2163.42
like beef cakey type of guy or that's

2162.04 --> 2165.4
not even you don't even need that it's

2163.42 --> 2167.82
just like I don't think I'm really Army

2165.4 --> 2167.82
material

2169.599 --> 2177.599
but I do like sympathize with people

2172.96 --> 2177.599
that can like really uphold order

2180.76 --> 2185.7400000000002
Romans were the best at implementation

2183.28 --> 2187.119
of that strategy

2185.74 --> 2189.2799999999997
right

2187.119 --> 2192.579
well they had all kinds of strategies

2189.28 --> 2194.619
like the walls right they would like one

2192.579 --> 2196.3590000000004
person would be fully dedicated to a

2194.619 --> 2198.52
shield and then the other would have

2196.359 --> 2200.5
Spears is like the fouling system and

2198.52 --> 2204.16
then just like

2200.5 --> 2206.02
certainly a spear just like stabs out of

2204.16 --> 2208.359
there like for

2206.02 --> 2211.359
a very long distance and anybody that's

2208.359 --> 2214.02
there is gonna get stabbed right balance

2211.359 --> 2214.02
yeah that's right

2217.359 --> 2219.54
thank you

2222.88 --> 2228.88
so Romans used that

2226.0 --> 2231.16
but they were also Romans were just also

2228.88 --> 2234.46
very trained

2231.16 --> 2238.2999999999997
at just combat with sword and shield

2234.46 --> 2241.66
training always training with that so

2238.3 --> 2244.1400000000003
they were also like competent pers in

2241.66 --> 2247.48
personal Combat on the fields

2244.14 --> 2248.74
beside like the the formation strategies

2247.48 --> 2251.619
and all that

2248.74 --> 2253.7799999999997
they were very militant like the Romans

2251.619 --> 2256.359
were just like professional military

2253.78 --> 2259.44
would just like keep on training and

2256.359 --> 2259.44
fighting until they died

2260.26 --> 2265.5400000000004
that's all they did

2262.839 --> 2268.74
as far as I've learned that is

2265.54 --> 2268.74
and it does make sense

2272.02 --> 2275.68
I mean those guys were like super

2274.48 --> 2278.5
healthy

2275.68 --> 2280.839
get wounded all the time and regenerate

2278.5 --> 2283.78
very quickly they would probably never

2280.839 --> 2286.0
get sick unless they were like

2283.78 --> 2288.82
super dehydrated or underfed

2286.0 --> 2291.3
malnourished for a long time

2288.82 --> 2291.3
right

2291.52 --> 2300.22
or didn't have a proper hot bath Hot

2295.24 --> 2303.52
Spring right after a battle oh I wish I

2300.22 --> 2305.6189999999997
had some nice hot bath to sit in oh oh

2303.52 --> 2309.16
here's Lucius

2305.619 --> 2310.06
it's gonna find us a hot spring to make

2309.16 --> 2312.339
a

2310.06 --> 2313.66
a nice bath with

2312.339 --> 2316.2
sorry

2313.66 --> 2316.2
it's just

2317.619 --> 2324.909
a

2319.46 --> 2324.909
[Music]

2332.98 --> 2340.26
Spawner in work oh dear apparent gravity

2336.54 --> 2340.2599999999998
bending on space time

2345.46 --> 2349.0
now I have okay

2347.14 --> 2350.56
sounds interesting

2349.0 --> 2352.78
all right well when somebody just

2350.56 --> 2354.099
blabbers on about gravity then just ask

2352.78 --> 2357.4
him like

2354.099 --> 2360.4
what's the phenomenon

2357.4 --> 2362.6800000000003
what is this gravity

2360.4 --> 2367.5
in the physical world

2362.68 --> 2367.5
in order to establish that it is a thing

2369.94 --> 2375.04
all right so this is like oh so

2371.98 --> 2377.26
depending of space time what what is

2375.04 --> 2380.44
that in the physical world what's the

2377.26 --> 2384.119
phenomenon like what does it actually do

2380.44 --> 2384.119
in the 3D World

2398.22 --> 2403.1189999999997
architecture in China

2400.839 --> 2407.099
really

2403.119 --> 2407.099
huh that's interesting

2411.52 --> 2414.119
huh

2415.07 --> 2418.1290000000004
[Music]

2420.21 --> 2423.51
[Music]

2454.9 --> 2459.46
what the [ __ ] are you talking about

2457.24 --> 2462.4599999999996
borders boy

2459.46 --> 2464.319
like what the hell I missed that comment

2462.46 --> 2467.7400000000002
there

2464.319 --> 2468.819
was a dark show yesterday with Tara And

2467.74 --> 2470.819
D

2468.819 --> 2470.819
ude

2471.28 --> 2473.8190000000004
yeah

2474.28 --> 2478.079
I think you're in the wrong Saloon buddy

2482.14 --> 2485.5
yeah

2483.52 --> 2490.079
I mean

2485.5 --> 2490.079
they have any idea what it is that I do

2490.24 --> 2493.72
if you're going to call those things

2491.8 --> 2497.38
dark if you're suddenly getting all

2493.72 --> 2501.5789999999997
Fundy on me then maybe you just need to

2497.38 --> 2505.359
go to your groups

2501.579 --> 2507.7000000000003
where people think exactly alike

2505.359 --> 2511.5989999999997
and don't address any of this except

2507.7 --> 2514.72
with paranoia to make you favorite a lot

2511.599 --> 2516.7000000000003
oh it's also scary and the devil and

2514.72 --> 2518.7999999999997
everything yeah well if you're like that

2516.7 --> 2521.2599999999998
then maybe you should seek out those

2518.8 --> 2524.38
types of shows

2521.26 --> 2527.8
people that like to think like that

2524.38 --> 2531.099
because this is not one of them yeah I

2527.8 --> 2532.3590000000004
break free I break free

2531.099 --> 2537.2200000000003
of

2532.359 --> 2539.7599999999998
just this devil markation of everything

2537.22 --> 2539.7599999999998
you understand

2540.46 --> 2547.18
like a pentagram for example yeah that's

2544.06 --> 2551.44
not evil that's late claim

2547.18 --> 2555.64
by evil and it's people

2551.44 --> 2558.94
that are like fundamentalist Christians

2555.64 --> 2561.7
that really just play into that you're

2558.94 --> 2563.7400000000002
literally the devil's slave your devil

2561.7 --> 2566.4399999999996
persecutors

2563.74 --> 2568.18
guess who's the devil persecutor the

2566.44 --> 2571.7400000000002
devil

2568.18 --> 2571.74
and you're his minion

2571.839 --> 2576.46
yeah who think who do you think invented

2574.18 --> 2580.06
that

2576.46 --> 2583.119
is it perhaps the church that literally

2580.06 --> 2586.359
erected to encapsulate and basically

2583.119 --> 2590.1400000000003
capture Christ's Legacy

2586.359 --> 2593.98
yeah they're the ones that invented that

2590.14 --> 2599.339
trick they are the devil

2593.98 --> 2599.339
and they make you into a devil

2602.74 --> 2609.24
you understand

2604.66 --> 2609.24
and I am not sympathetic anymore

2609.52 --> 2617.2
I mean like this Christianity is not

2613.48 --> 2619.3
Christianity it is wrong

2617.2 --> 2622.5989999999997
all of it

2619.3 --> 2625.0
the way people conduct themselves

2622.599 --> 2627.28
it's wrong

2625.0 --> 2629.92
you're misunderstanding you're not

2627.28 --> 2632.3190000000004
getting a grasp on reality you're

2629.92 --> 2636.599
literally incorporating

2632.319 --> 2636.599
ignorance out of fear

2637.3 --> 2645.8390000000004
ignorance out of fear huh

2640.839 --> 2645.839
that doesn't sound very Godly to me

2650.82 --> 2653.949
[Music]

2655.78 --> 2662.44
yeah it's just a difference of opinion

2658.359 --> 2664.66
yeah and it's a very bad difference of

2662.44 --> 2667.9
opinion borders boy

2664.66 --> 2670.74
is this one of my struggles yeah I

2667.9 --> 2670.7400000000002
oppose that

2671.14 --> 2675.359
yeah I oppose that

2676.06 --> 2681.24
yeah evil and good is determined

2681.94 --> 2688.18
by choices choices that you make and the

2685.42 --> 2691.359
reason and the context but it's also

2688.18 --> 2695.14
awareness awareness

2691.359 --> 2698.339
of what is real and what is not

2695.14 --> 2698.339
in everything

2699.04 --> 2705.06
and if you can't

2701.619 --> 2705.06
if you can't go there

2705.579 --> 2714.599
then like I am not going to adapt to

2709.24 --> 2714.5989999999997
your form of spiritual slavery you see

2723.96 --> 2733.9
good then I am pagan you understand then

2728.74 --> 2738.22
I am Pagan I'm a pagan I'm not that

2733.9 --> 2740.26
thing that you are you understand

2738.22 --> 2742.48
you can call it whatever the [ __ ] you

2740.26 --> 2745.7200000000003
want you can call me a Satanist if you

2742.48 --> 2747.96
if you have to according to how you

2745.72 --> 2751.7799999999997
think you can call me that for sure yeah

2747.96 --> 2755.079
I like to be defined by my actions and

2751.78 --> 2757.1800000000003
the motivations behind those actions

2755.079 --> 2760.0
and the quality

2757.18 --> 2764.2799999999997
of the information that I share

2760.0 --> 2767.38
and not buy some rigid priesthood

2764.28 --> 2770.3190000000004
wizard chant

2767.38 --> 2771.4
that's completely out of context every

2770.319 --> 2774.339
time

2771.4 --> 2778.359
I'm not going to be propelled by that

2774.339 --> 2782.2799999999997
and be enslaved to the Devils that

2778.359 --> 2785.68
created that to encapsulate the true

2782.28 --> 2790.0600000000004
releasing relieving and enlightening

2785.68 --> 2792.7599999999998
power of Christ Ascension you understand

2790.06 --> 2794.0789999999997
you're not going to take that power away

2792.76 --> 2795.3390000000004
from me

2794.079 --> 2797.6800000000003
yeah

2795.339 --> 2800.7999999999997
I know you can't

2797.68 --> 2803.02
I can only relinquish it and I'm not

2800.8 --> 2806.5
going to

2803.02 --> 2812.88
you understand it's mine it's my

2806.5 --> 2812.88
Heritage as a human being created by God

2813.099 --> 2817.48
and I shall be judged by God

2816.22 --> 2821.3799999999997
yeah

2817.48 --> 2824.2
and I do not fear judgment by God

2821.38 --> 2825.94
because I've done my best

2824.2 --> 2830.2
and I adapt

2825.94 --> 2833.38
I adapt to the truth when I am informed

2830.2 --> 2836.2599999999998
about it because the truth sometimes is

2833.38 --> 2837.52
elusive you think you got it but then it

2836.26 --> 2839.38
seems that you didn't actually

2837.52 --> 2842.2599999999998
completely get it

2839.38 --> 2844.78
right there's more complexities the

2842.26 --> 2847.78
fractal deepens I'm very well aware of

2844.78 --> 2849.099
this and I am adapting to truth and

2847.78 --> 2852.099
reality

2849.099 --> 2856.319
actual reality

2852.099 --> 2856.319
as far as my senses can reach

2860.02 --> 2864.04
so if that makes me a freaking Pagan

2862.96 --> 2869.859
then

2864.04 --> 2870.55
so be it I'm a pagan yeah oh my God I'm

2869.859 --> 2871.72
a pagan

2870.55 --> 2876.76
[Music]

2871.72 --> 2879.819
whatever man I I understand Christ

2876.76 --> 2881.92
I respect him

2879.819 --> 2884.2
more than most people will ever

2881.92 --> 2886.1800000000003
understand because they don't even know

2884.2 --> 2888.16
what it is they believe in they don't

2886.18 --> 2890.319
even know what that book is what those

2888.16 --> 2891.5789999999997
texts are they don't know anything about

2890.319 --> 2893.68
it

2891.579 --> 2896.319
they just LED on it on some kind of

2893.68 --> 2898.8999999999996
Adventure Trail

2896.319 --> 2902.16
based on somebody else's super visual

2898.9 --> 2902.1600000000003
vision of it

2902.68 --> 2905.16
right

2906.22 --> 2910.72
and the endless quotes from everybody

2908.619 --> 2913.3
but Jesus himself

2910.72 --> 2915.52
and when Jesus says something then of

2913.3 --> 2917.7400000000002
course you can't actually try to figure

2915.52 --> 2921.22
out what it means that he actually says

2917.74 --> 2924.339
and why and what context to who did he

2921.22 --> 2926.4599999999996
say it and who in that time when he was

2924.339 --> 2929.74
speaking about it was he probably

2926.46 --> 2932.859
pointing at indirectly right if he

2929.74 --> 2936.3999999999996
accuses something then maybe he's

2932.859 --> 2939.52
accusing people that happen to be doing

2936.4 --> 2943.2400000000002
that something and he's warning people

2939.52 --> 2945.579
around him about those people indirectly

2943.24 --> 2947.3799999999997
right because if you just say no those

2945.579 --> 2949.3590000000004
are the bad men

2947.38 --> 2952.42
yeah that's very clear historically

2949.359 --> 2955.48
right but people don't work that way

2952.42 --> 2958.2400000000002
well if you then warn them for the very

2955.48 --> 2961.119
specific dangerous actions that they do

2958.24 --> 2962.7999999999997
without naming them then the people will

2961.119 --> 2965.319
be focused learning about those

2962.8 --> 2967.96
dangerous actions and then when they

2965.319 --> 2971.319
bump into them then they are warned

2967.96 --> 2975.099
instead of just hearing their Target and

2971.319 --> 2978.4
then they won't have that effect yes has

2975.099 --> 2981.339
anybody ever even thought of that

2978.4 --> 2986.579
of what it is to be Christ and trying to

2981.339 --> 2986.5789999999997
teach dim-witted people with brilliance

2987.46 --> 2991.96
I don't think so

2989.92 --> 2995.2000000000003
people are just interested in how can

2991.96 --> 2998.92
you degrade downgrade over simplify

2995.2 --> 3001.4399999999996
until you have good bad good bad bad

2998.92 --> 3002.76
good good bad bad good like some kind of

3001.44 --> 3006.7200000000003
a

3002.76 --> 3009.42
bit code some computer code ones and

3006.72 --> 3011.819
zeros good bad bad good good bad get bad

3009.42 --> 3014.839
good good good bad good that's not how

3011.819 --> 3014.839
it freaking works

3015.24 --> 3021.4399999999996
it's just

3017.579 --> 3021.44
it's not a computer program

3032.4 --> 3037.339
always Gnostic and Pagan different I

3035.099 --> 3037.339
don't know

3037.68 --> 3044.72
dude I'm just going by what he said I

3040.2 --> 3044.72
dude I don't need like Keegan is

3045.059 --> 3050.2200000000003
but at this point what the [ __ ] does

3048.18 --> 3052.7599999999998
that even mean anymore

3050.22 --> 3052.7599999999998
right

3053.04 --> 3057.0
it's like what the hell does that even

3054.78 --> 3059.5400000000004
mean

3057.0 --> 3059.54
like

3062.4 --> 3067.02
and yeah people are all so set because

3065.04 --> 3068.7
there's the certain sources and they're

3067.02 --> 3070.859
all synchronizing and they're all saying

3068.7 --> 3073.859
this is what it is see this is the the

3070.859 --> 3076.02
biggest city and they're just always

3073.859 --> 3078.42
saying it in the same thing in the same

3076.02 --> 3082.2599999999998
intensity and then people are accepting

3078.42 --> 3084.1800000000003
it like that's how it is no it's not

3082.26 --> 3087.42
but most of

3084.18 --> 3089.339
it's just so over generalized right and

3087.42 --> 3091.619
even that's already kind of dangerous

3089.339 --> 3092.96
with like Satanism if you call things

3091.619 --> 3097.1400000000003
Satanism

3092.96 --> 3101.0
it's already fragmented a bit

3097.14 --> 3101.0
because what the hell even is that

3106.859 --> 3110.94
most Christianity is crowleyism who is

3109.44 --> 3114.359
that what yeah that's the that's the

3110.94 --> 3115.92
Owen bed well that's the fundamentalists

3114.359 --> 3117.96
right that's like the Christian

3115.92 --> 3120.059
fundamentalist let's just say no if you

3117.96 --> 3123.42
just believe this riddle then you're

3120.059 --> 3125.52
free you will go to heaven

3123.42 --> 3127.619
I don't think anyone actually ever

3125.52 --> 3130.2599999999998
promised by Christ like that

3127.619 --> 3132.3
right just believe me and you'll go to

3130.26 --> 3135.599
no

3132.3 --> 3138.48
what he says is you can't what is it

3135.599 --> 3140.579
you can't reach the Lord

3138.48 --> 3142.14
oh you can only reach the Lord like

3140.579 --> 3146.3390000000004
through me

3142.14 --> 3149.839
right now that doesn't mean that at all

3146.339 --> 3149.839
that's not the same meaning

3156.54 --> 3162.24
right so yeah no I'm not I don't think

3159.54 --> 3164.94
I'm a pagan I'm just saying it as an

3162.24 --> 3166.9799999999996
example and like I don't give a [ __ ]

3164.94 --> 3170.579
record it

3166.98 --> 3173.339
Loop it make funny Graphics around my

3170.579 --> 3174.599
head whatever the [ __ ] man it doesn't

3173.339 --> 3177.9
matter

3174.599 --> 3181.6800000000003
it doesn't matter [ __ ]

3177.9 --> 3184.98
I am what I do

3181.68 --> 3186.72
right and I'm very focused on Jesus

3184.98 --> 3189.599
Christ

3186.72 --> 3192.48
I use him in my prayer

3189.599 --> 3196.44
take it very serious

3192.48 --> 3199.26
so I don't care if I'm not following a

3196.44 --> 3202.2000000000003
rigid methodology

3199.26 --> 3204.1800000000003
of a bunch of Christian

3202.2 --> 3206.64
priest followers

3204.18 --> 3208.5589999999997
like that's not what I'm doing I'm gonna

3206.64 --> 3211.68
do what I do

3208.559 --> 3214.1400000000003
try and stop me

3211.68 --> 3217.5
yeah I will not be stopped I will not be

3214.14 --> 3220.44
stopped by evil that knows they're evil

3217.5 --> 3222.839
and I will not be stopped by ignorant

3220.44 --> 3225.54
people that think they're good

3222.839 --> 3228.18
I'm gonna do what I'm gonna do and I

3225.54 --> 3231.18
will test if something is evil or not

3228.18 --> 3234.18
and I have tested if things were evil or

3231.18 --> 3235.5589999999997
not in the past Way Beyond my comfort

3234.18 --> 3238.68
zone

3235.559 --> 3243.0
yeah I've learned so much about that

3238.68 --> 3247.16
[ __ ] in ways that is like

3243.0 --> 3247.16
I can't even explain it to you

3256.26 --> 3261.119
I consider myself a Christian but hey if

3259.74 --> 3262.3799999999997
you don't agree

3261.119 --> 3264.78
it's fine

3262.38 --> 3267.1800000000003
and you go do your little Priestly

3264.78 --> 3270.8390000000004
squirt religion

3267.18 --> 3273.18
and we'll figure out who's evil

3270.839 --> 3274.68
in the end

3273.18 --> 3278.1189999999997
foreign

3274.68 --> 3278.1189999999997
I certainly will

3294.9 --> 3300.599
is that a lot of yeah about things about

3297.859 --> 3303.48
Islamic yeah that's yeah

3300.599 --> 3305.579
well the thing is flatter Sage yeah

3303.48 --> 3308.48
it's good you realize that I haven't

3305.579 --> 3308.48
done that yeah

3309.66 --> 3317.7
I've never done that like ever

3314.46 --> 3319.2
because I knew that about Islam for a

3317.7 --> 3321.839
very long time

3319.2 --> 3324.6189999999997
I respected Islam before I respected

3321.839 --> 3324.619
Christianity

3329.64 --> 3333.54
and then I truly figured out

3331.619 --> 3335.819
Christianity what it really is the

3333.54 --> 3338.7
complications and then I really knew

3335.819 --> 3341.16
that I'm a Christian

3338.7 --> 3345.96
whatever that even means at this point

3341.16 --> 3347.0989999999997
right I just knew like that's that's my

3345.96 --> 3351.359
method

3347.099 --> 3354.119
My Method Christ my method

3351.359 --> 3356.339
and I'm not perfectly like that I'm not

3354.119 --> 3360.299
trying to reenact

3356.339 --> 3363.42
him perfectly what I'm trying to learn

3360.299 --> 3365.7
every lesson I can and I'm like

3363.42 --> 3369.78
realizing it

3365.7 --> 3371.64
I will overstap certain boundaries and I

3369.78 --> 3374.579
must to test them

3371.64 --> 3377.46
things that might have been like super

3374.579 --> 3379.6800000000003
hardcore over the edge

3377.46 --> 3382.26
two thousand years ago

3379.68 --> 3385.2
like I think that astrology back then

3382.26 --> 3388.7990000000004
was probably done by some really [ __ ]

3385.2 --> 3390.0589999999997
up creepy people yeah like really evil

3388.799 --> 3392.099
priests

3390.059 --> 3394.5
that would just like enchant you

3392.099 --> 3397.2000000000003
indoctrinate you and manipulate you as

3394.5 --> 3400.14
they were doing it really evil and just

3397.2 --> 3402.96
by listening to them hearing them say it

3400.14 --> 3404.94
it would change you because it was so

3402.96 --> 3408.48
intense and the people back then didn't

3404.94 --> 3410.52
have the the media to make to dumb them

3408.48 --> 3411.96
down and to like make them used to

3410.52 --> 3414.24
everything so it would have just been

3411.96 --> 3417.78
like super overwhelming and [ __ ] yeah

3414.24 --> 3419.339
magic yeah then it's evil then it's evil

3417.78 --> 3421.619
I agree

3419.339 --> 3424.5589999999997
because then the people that probably

3421.619 --> 3427.44
did astrology were probably really

3424.559 --> 3429.78
[ __ ] evil and even to the point where

3427.44 --> 3433.02
they would make people just volunteer

3429.78 --> 3435.9
for sacrifice and [ __ ] like [ __ ] evil

3433.02 --> 3438.72
okay so I get it yeah

3435.9 --> 3441.42
that's not what I'm doing I'm not even

3438.72 --> 3444.7799999999997
interested in that not even remotely I'm

3441.42 --> 3447.6800000000003
aware of it I never want anything I do

3444.78 --> 3447.6800000000003
to go there

3447.78 --> 3453.079
you see

3449.22 --> 3453.0789999999997
I'm aware of the danger

3454.619 --> 3463.6800000000003
even with astrology dude it even having

3458.66 --> 3468.44
empathy okay having empathy is a risk

3463.68 --> 3468.44
yeah and I'm [ __ ] born with that okay

3471.839 --> 3479.4
yeah having the abilities that I have

3475.02 --> 3481.92
born with that yeah that's a risk

3479.4 --> 3483.839
that's a spiritual risk and I've been

3481.92 --> 3488.119
through that risk and I've been on the

3483.839 --> 3488.119
wrong side and suffered for it and

3488.52 --> 3494.46
thank God I did so very little when I

3492.48 --> 3497.839
was on the dark side thank God of that

3494.46 --> 3501.0
but even where my mind dwelled is still

3497.839 --> 3504.7799999999997
torturous to remember for me now even

3501.0 --> 3506.64
where my mind dwelled when I was evil is

3504.78 --> 3509.3390000000004
still torturous to me even though I

3506.64 --> 3511.2599999999998
didn't physically even do anything evil

3509.339 --> 3514.0789999999997
barely

3511.26 --> 3517.5
even where my mind dwelt is like torture

3514.079 --> 3519.799
to me okay so I'm very well aware of

3517.5 --> 3519.799
that

3520.74 --> 3526.9799999999996
I'm not some ignorant dumbass it's like

3524.579 --> 3529.5
oh let's go to Ouija board oh I'm so

3526.98 --> 3532.079
bored I wish some [ __ ] demon or

3529.5 --> 3535.74
something just gave me power and blah

3532.079 --> 3538.5
blah I'm not an idiot anymore I kind of

3535.74 --> 3540.66
used to be a bit of an idiot like that

3538.5 --> 3544.02
when I was younger

3540.66 --> 3546.66
but it was also very scared always of

3544.02 --> 3549.54
dark entities because I've even been

3546.66 --> 3553.2799999999997
visited by really scary things in my

3549.54 --> 3558.9
dreams and I just I never had that weird

3553.28 --> 3563.579
modern cognitive break put on me like oh

3558.9 --> 3565.799
it's only a dream it's not real right my

3563.579 --> 3568.1400000000003
parents weren't like that like ah oh

3565.799 --> 3569.7599999999998
Arwen has another weird nightmares again

3568.14 --> 3571.5
like

3569.76 --> 3573.0
they wouldn't like them like oh it's

3571.5 --> 3574.92
just a dream it's not real they wouldn't

3573.0 --> 3577.5
do that they knew

3574.92 --> 3578.819
that dreams were real my mother

3577.5 --> 3580.619
especially

3578.819 --> 3582.599
and

3580.619 --> 3585.599
she would just like

3582.599 --> 3588.3590000000004
help me figure it out

3585.599 --> 3591.319
even the darkness

3588.359 --> 3591.319
in my dreams

3592.44 --> 3594.92
right

3596.4 --> 3600.78
so yeah I was all very revealing in my

3598.98 --> 3603.079
side but that's what it is this is what

3600.78 --> 3603.079
I am

3617.76 --> 3622.26
are you talking about the globe religion

3620.16 --> 3625.94
Akuma virus

3622.26 --> 3625.94
because that would make a lot of sense

3639.839 --> 3643.94
are you talking about food again

3648.66 --> 3656.42
those astrologers can be called witches

3651.24 --> 3656.4199999999996
Wizards right it's people yeah right

3659.94 --> 3664.92
right so I'm ready to basically make a

3663.18 --> 3667.68
stand for that

3664.92 --> 3670.2000000000003
to really dig deeper

3667.68 --> 3673.5589999999997
but it has to be serious if somebody's

3670.2 --> 3675.5589999999997
just going to be content like oh Arwin

3673.559 --> 3679.079
is trying to counter

3675.559 --> 3682.92
the word of Jesus or something

3679.079 --> 3684.96
he's just evil right if that's your end

3682.92 --> 3688.26
goal in a discussion then I'm not gonna

3684.96 --> 3691.619
have a discussion with you but I am very

3688.26 --> 3694.26
willing to really dig to the bottom of

3691.619 --> 3695.7000000000003
where you can dig basically when it

3694.26 --> 3700.079
concerns that

3695.7 --> 3703.4399999999996
that passage that is said by Christ and

3700.079 --> 3705.8390000000004
really figure out what he means why

3703.44 --> 3707.819
and if somebody insists on being

3705.839 --> 3710.7599999999998
fundamentalist about it

3707.819 --> 3712.2
then I will not have a discussion with

3710.76 --> 3715.7400000000002
them about it

3712.2 --> 3717.5389999999998
but I'm very well willing to really have

3715.74 --> 3719.7
somebody's expertise

3717.539 --> 3722.099
available especially if they like know

3719.7 --> 3725.22
the old languages and all that to really

3722.099 --> 3727.92
put together what that means why who he

3725.22 --> 3731.7
was who was he talking to

3727.92 --> 3734.339
what was the situation to who would it

3731.7 --> 3736.9199999999996
have typically applied

3734.339 --> 3740.0389999999998
right it's like this

3736.92 --> 3742.859
if you only ever met people

3740.039 --> 3745.38
that dabbled in astrology in your life

3742.859 --> 3747.7799999999997
and every single one of them was like

3745.38 --> 3750.359
really evil or like really scared of

3747.78 --> 3754.799
showing their knowledge about it

3750.359 --> 3756.66
yeah I myself if I would have like grown

3754.799 --> 3758.7
up like that I would have probably said

3756.66 --> 3760.3799999999997
that oh astrologers are like really

3758.7 --> 3762.5989999999997
dangerous and Evil

3760.38 --> 3766.079
yeah I would have said that

3762.599 --> 3767.7000000000003
because that's every single time I was

3766.079 --> 3770.2200000000003
facing it it would have been somebody

3767.7 --> 3771.0589999999997
evil so of course I'd call it all evil

3770.22 --> 3775.819
then

3771.059 --> 3775.8190000000004
right I mean come on

3777.96 --> 3781.98
what passage I don't know which one it

3780.48 --> 3783.42
was I didn't not very good at

3781.98 --> 3786.7400000000002
remembering that

3783.42 --> 3786.7400000000002
is basically where

3788.46 --> 3791.66
it was mentioned yesterday

3792.24 --> 3794.9599999999996
I don't know

3814.5 --> 3816.68
foreign

3838.44 --> 3842.52
so yeah sorry I can't help you with the

3840.599 --> 3847.76
passage there maybe somebody else here

3842.52 --> 3847.7599999999998
that's really good at finding passages

3856.98 --> 3862.02
it's a very good point Eric

3859.079 --> 3865.98
yeah yeah that's right

3862.02 --> 3869.72
right because a religion people go get

3865.98 --> 3869.72
into religion to hide

3871.559 --> 3876.1800000000003
to seek

3873.359 --> 3878.0989999999997
Comfort solace

3876.18 --> 3880.98
from

3878.099 --> 3884.7200000000003
things in the world that they are unable

3880.98 --> 3884.72
to or unwilling to face

3905.76 --> 3911.3390000000004
as a definition tool hmm

3909.66 --> 3915.6189999999997
okay

3911.339 --> 3915.619
how would that work seeking style water

3916.319 --> 3920.46
makes sense though yeah it is a very

3918.78 --> 3922.8590000000004
personal growth

3920.46 --> 3925.079
directed

3922.859 --> 3927.5989999999997
more than the definition to I noticed

3925.079 --> 3930.92
that of course the numbers are just

3927.599 --> 3930.92
always going to be the numbers

3944.64 --> 3950.0589999999997
well anyway my chats at least go in

3947.88 --> 3950.059
today

3954.839 --> 3957.74
foreign

3984.03 --> 3987.5190000000002
[Music]

3995.48 --> 4001.48
Hinduism discovered the globe and so

3998.819 --> 4001.48
gravel

4014.839 --> 4019.7
yeah turret I'm afraid that India in the

4017.599 --> 4022.2200000000003
future is going to have a very very

4019.7 --> 4026.319
serious gamma problem

4022.22 --> 4026.319
maybe even worse than the West

4027.859 --> 4031.7599999999998
right now all those Gammas at least

4029.9 --> 4034.76
aren't going to be like [ __ ] and all

4031.76 --> 4037.28
that but there's still gonna be like an

4034.76 --> 4039.6800000000003
outrageous amount of Gammas that are

4037.28 --> 4041.8390000000004
going to be very [ __ ] up

4039.68 --> 4043.22
there's already pretty [ __ ] up Gammas

4041.839 --> 4046.18
in India

4043.22 --> 4046.18
that I've noticed

4047.0 --> 4052.4
right it's like this some Indian people

4050.059 --> 4054.98
have they're like they have the light

4052.4 --> 4058.2200000000003
they have they're like they have the

4054.98 --> 4059.359
actual wisdom they get it they really do

4058.22 --> 4061.8799999999997
get it

4059.359 --> 4064.819
I usually also passionate but then

4061.88 --> 4066.98
there's just some of these guys

4064.819 --> 4069.579
and they bump into them just sometimes

4066.98 --> 4072.26
and they just seem like freaking

4069.579 --> 4074.6600000000003
sociopaths that don't even

4072.26 --> 4078.039
like try to hide it

4074.66 --> 4078.0389999999998
it's really creepy

4078.619 --> 4082.059
and I think it's getting worse

4085.28 --> 4089.44
due to scam is through

4088.24 --> 4094.16
[Music]

4089.44 --> 4096.62
Bollywood yeah well no surprise

4094.16 --> 4099.0199999999995
it's the same effect right Bollywood is

4096.62 --> 4101.599999999999
just like Hollywood

4099.02 --> 4103.819
they are

4101.6 --> 4106.58
like they would have to be it's like it

4103.819 --> 4108.799
has to be pretty much the same

4106.58 --> 4111.14
so they're gonna get more gamma they're

4108.799 --> 4114.14
gonna make everybody more gamma more

4111.14 --> 4114.14
secular

4136.819 --> 4142.279
you were like spiritually

4139.58 --> 4144.3189999999995
would be what but what is that

4142.279 --> 4146.659000000001
the event

4144.319 --> 4150.1
is that a real what

4146.659 --> 4150.099999999999
I thought it's just a description

4151.279 --> 4156.319
everything is a freaking religion these

4153.5 --> 4158.359
days sucks it's like all these words are

4156.319 --> 4161.54
just being claimed for a religion it

4158.359 --> 4164.319
makes absolutely no sense

4161.54 --> 4164.319
uh

4177.38 --> 4185.4400000000005
okay pjc net weird

4181.819 --> 4185.4400000000005
it's just like come on man

4194.06 --> 4197.5
in the UK okay

4223.04 --> 4228.56
hmm okay territory well I put I have a

4226.76 --> 4230.12
prediction for you

4228.56 --> 4233.780000000001
about it

4230.12 --> 4239.239
right if it is like why as I have posted

4233.78 --> 4241.28
and as I prophesize the Gammas will grow

4239.239 --> 4243.62
and you already connected it to

4241.28 --> 4247.04
Bollywood well I think that because

4243.62 --> 4250.28
India is not gay

4247.04 --> 4252.98
unlike America yeah that's right America

4250.28 --> 4255.159
you're gay

4252.98 --> 4255.159
foreign

4256.52 --> 4261.7390000000005
if it's gonna get worse and worse well

4259.28 --> 4263.599999999999
in America nobody does anything because

4261.739 --> 4266.48
they're gay and when you're gay you

4263.6 --> 4268.58
don't do anything about evil anymore you

4266.48 --> 4271.099999999999
just let it happen that's basically the

4268.58 --> 4274.1
influence of gay on The Nation

4271.1 --> 4275.719
evil is just let roam free nobody does

4274.1 --> 4280.1
anything about it that's the

4275.719 --> 4282.86
consequences of normalizing gay is

4280.1 --> 4285.320000000001
Progressive yeah that means evil roams

4282.86 --> 4287.599999999999
free nobody does anything about it yeah

4285.32 --> 4290.0599999999995
uh in India

4287.6 --> 4293.0
they don't do that so

4290.06 --> 4296.659000000001
here's my prediction if Bollywood goes

4293.0 --> 4300.02
really sick and satanic more and more

4296.659 --> 4303.139999999999
and more and becomes like too overt

4300.02 --> 4304.88
they're they're gonna have like a riot

4303.14 --> 4306.08
on their hands

4304.88 --> 4309.1990000000005
because

4306.08 --> 4311.62
India people Indians

4309.199 --> 4314.54
they might just like

4311.62 --> 4318.14
not actually tolerated

4314.54 --> 4320.54
and if like if it's really that bad and

4318.14 --> 4323.54
there's like even like pedo [ __ ] and all

4320.54 --> 4325.78
that involved I don't know if there is I

4323.54 --> 4328.1
hope not but

4325.78 --> 4330.259999999999
I don't even want to know but if there

4328.1 --> 4333.08
is then dude they're just gonna like

4330.26 --> 4335.659000000001
Burn It Down

4333.08 --> 4338.42
right which they are not doing with

4335.659 --> 4342.199
Hollywood because everybody's a [ __ ] in

4338.42 --> 4344.42
America well in India I bet you that

4342.199 --> 4346.28
they would actually then burn it down if

4344.42 --> 4350.54
it turns out to be that bad

4346.28 --> 4354.139999999999
so that's my prediction at some point

4350.54 --> 4359.08
probably gonna be a huge Riot and then

4354.14 --> 4359.08
like a whole Bollywood might just burn

4359.6 --> 4363.1
I don't know when it's gonna happen

4365.3 --> 4372.08
it all depends on just like how

4368.96 --> 4375.86
how much the slider of darkness is going

4372.08 --> 4378.62
to be pulled down even further right and

4375.86 --> 4381.32
he has already dealing with like the

4378.62 --> 4383.36
Monsanto [ __ ] in the past and now the

4381.32 --> 4385.099999999999
facts scam

4383.36 --> 4388.04
and if they're like aren't just gonna

4385.1 --> 4389.659000000001
get overtly satanic too then that's

4388.04 --> 4391.58
probably gonna tip

4389.659 --> 4394.04
the scale that's going to make the

4391.58 --> 4397.64
bucket spill and they're probably just

4394.04 --> 4399.86
going to burn down holy Bollywood then

4397.64 --> 4401.0
so

4399.86 --> 4403.099999999999
keep

4401.0 --> 4406.84
an eye out

4403.1 --> 4406.84
for that to happen at some point

4412.82 --> 4417.62
that's right India definitely not gay

4414.679 --> 4420.26
but they do like space that's right

4417.62 --> 4422.5
who wouldn't like space man space is

4420.26 --> 4422.5
awesome

4423.34 --> 4429.37
especially now with all the great CGI

4426.2 --> 4429.37
[Music]

4432.09 --> 4435.8
[Music]

4433.4 --> 4439.879999999999
the gay thing is for population because

4435.8 --> 4441.5
yeah no [ __ ] but it's I I know that I

4439.88 --> 4445.58
just wanted to point out the very

4441.5 --> 4449.42
specific effect that it has

4445.58 --> 4452.54
when a nation is made gay then they

4449.42 --> 4454.28
come out for evil and nobody does

4452.54 --> 4457.6
anything about it

4454.28 --> 4462.08
that's like the direct

4457.6 --> 4464.900000000001
consequence like immediately noticeable

4462.08 --> 4468.739
oh it's gay oh we're Progressive we're

4464.9 --> 4473.08
gay so cool gays and TV openly gay gay

4468.739 --> 4477.5
gay pride yeah well that means that

4473.08 --> 4480.5599999999995
ah dark freaking Grabbers evil [ __ ]

4477.5 --> 4482.96
satanists are gonna be like oh okay oh

4480.56 --> 4485.9800000000005
okay now we're gonna legalize

4482.96 --> 4485.9800000000005
beautifully now

4486.02 --> 4492.64
because gays don't do anything about

4490.28 --> 4492.639999999999
that

4493.1 --> 4498.38
on average I mean they're

4495.86 --> 4501.799999999999
a couple of gays probably like

4498.38 --> 4505.52
like really like a no way pedophilia Etc

4501.8 --> 4507.26
right the problem is on average

4505.52 --> 4509.84
doesn't work like that

4507.26 --> 4511.88
because it's not only that they're gay

4509.84 --> 4514.9400000000005
now it's also that

4511.88 --> 4518.0
being like that changes you and a lot of

4514.94 --> 4522.259999999999
like the original mob mentality like

4518.0 --> 4524.96
fire and I know Indians have

4522.26 --> 4529.46
that's gonna die down with that right

4524.96 --> 4531.679
well in India they haven't done it they

4529.46 --> 4535.1
haven't tolerated gay so they still have

4531.679 --> 4538.6990000000005
that mob mentality fire

4535.1 --> 4541.159000000001
when things go really dark and evil and

4538.699 --> 4544.429999999999
evil comes out of the Shadows so expect

4541.159 --> 4551.839999999999
that to happen it's my prediction

4544.43 --> 4551.84
[Music]

4553.159 --> 4557.599999999999
is the Netherlands a country on the

4555.26 --> 4559.219
downfall

4557.6 --> 4562.219
foreign

4559.219 --> 4562.219
Traveler

4562.28 --> 4568.5199999999995
I mean we are we have basically gone

4565.76 --> 4570.92
through the loop of gay

4568.52 --> 4573.14
probably more than any other country in

4570.92 --> 4575.42
the world

4573.14 --> 4578.12
I mean yeah

4575.42 --> 4581.659
it's disgusting but on the other hand

4578.12 --> 4584.239
there is also a very sharp counter

4581.659 --> 4586.699
mentality now

4584.239 --> 4590.659
so maybe you could almost say that we're

4586.699 --> 4592.879999999999
we've gone through our gay Cold War

4590.659 --> 4596.239
and we're like

4592.88 --> 4598.400000000001
now climbing out of it

4596.239 --> 4601.099999999999
like I know for sure that like things

4598.4 --> 4604.96
like pedophilia will they will not be

4601.1 --> 4604.96
able to be tolerated here

4605.96 --> 4611.32
like I know they won't be able to do

4608.9 --> 4611.32
that here

4611.36 --> 4614.5
and like America

4616.159 --> 4625.639999999999
right because even the gays here

4620.84 --> 4627.8
we have more sensible Gaze on average in

4625.64 --> 4630.92
the Netherlands than in other countries

4627.8 --> 4632.679
okay there you go our gays are more

4630.92 --> 4637.4800000000005
sensible on average

4632.679 --> 4637.4800000000005
hooray the Netherlands yay

4637.699 --> 4642.32
but it's true though

4640.58 --> 4645.26
uh

4642.32 --> 4649.659
like at least they're not gonna be like

4645.26 --> 4649.659000000001
turn like Pro pedophilia [ __ ]

4650.12 --> 4653.12
laughs

4656.96 --> 4661.46
but maybe it's also because the

4659.12 --> 4663.38
Netherlands is just a smaller country so

4661.46 --> 4665.6
we're all closer to one another and we

4663.38 --> 4667.76
don't have like oh that's on the other

4665.6 --> 4670.76
side we don't care

4667.76 --> 4672.38
right let them do whatever they want we

4670.76 --> 4674.900000000001
don't really have that because yeah the

4672.38 --> 4678.34
Netherlands is a really tiny country

4674.9 --> 4678.339999999999
compared to like the US

4678.679 --> 4683.02
like we don't have an east and west

4680.659 --> 4683.0199999999995
coast

4693.38 --> 4696.28
foreign

4706.04 --> 4709.719
do you mean sensible

4714.5 --> 4717.159
no

4746.38 --> 4750.7390000000005
it's interesting clutch now have you

4749.179 --> 4754.4
ever considered that maybe the biblical

4750.739 --> 4757.699
end times isn't just chronological

4754.4 --> 4760.46
in a sense that it's not literally one

4757.699 --> 4762.799999999999
step to the other Maybe

4760.46 --> 4765.62
the end times

4762.8 --> 4769.159000000001
is just the blueprint that they're using

4765.62 --> 4770.659
to roll out their control scheme yeah I

4769.159 --> 4774.08
don't think it is the end time I think

4770.659 --> 4776.299999999999
that the end times is being invoked

4774.08 --> 4779.44
on purpose

4776.3 --> 4779.4400000000005
as a scheme

4790.159 --> 4794.5
and I think the end times is here at all

4794.54 --> 4800.42
I don't think it's not yeah like in a

4797.36 --> 4802.639999999999
way it is but not physically but then

4800.42 --> 4805.46
again maybe the end times just isn't

4802.64 --> 4811.280000000001
what we really think it is maybe it is

4805.46 --> 4813.56
always spiritual and purely spiritual

4811.28 --> 4816.5599999999995
maybe the entire thing is not literal

4813.56 --> 4819.620000000001
maybe it is a like Dark World reflection

4816.56 --> 4823.639
that might be a reoccurring thing

4819.62 --> 4826.599999999999
as a scenario that might replay itself

4823.639 --> 4829.179
within the spiritual realm among people

4826.6 --> 4832.6990000000005
throughout time something that

4829.179 --> 4834.7390000000005
re-arrives again and again

4832.699 --> 4837.98
and every time it's going to be the same

4834.739 --> 4840.799999999999
we have to face the same type of issues

4837.98 --> 4844.699
and now this time this group of

4840.8 --> 4848.42
globalist satanic freaks they're really

4844.699 --> 4851.36
like making an effort to like hit as

4848.42 --> 4856.04
many points off the end times as they

4851.36 --> 4859.88
can on purpose because they want it they

4856.04 --> 4861.679
want you to believe that they are the

4859.88 --> 4865.159000000001
devil

4861.679 --> 4866.96
and that it is coming

4865.159 --> 4871.0
that's what I think

4866.96 --> 4871.0
I don't think it is actually happening

4871.82 --> 4876.94
not have been a physical form anyway

4883.4 --> 4888.799999999999
what percentage of people

4885.86 --> 4891.46
the [ __ ] should I know

4888.8 --> 4891.46
I don't know

4892.699 --> 4896.199
don't think it really matters

4897.08 --> 4899.08
um

4910.1 --> 4914.02
in time already happened okay

4914.659 --> 4918.699
are you surrounded by ruins of advances

4916.52 --> 4922.400000000001
destroyed anything

4918.699 --> 4923.48
it was to be giant cool why not

4922.4 --> 4925.5199999999995
yeah

4923.48 --> 4927.799999999999
that's yeah that's pretty much succinct

4925.52 --> 4930.860000000001
with what I said yeah it already

4927.8 --> 4932.4800000000005
happened well who's to say it's not

4930.86 --> 4934.699
gonna happen again

4932.48 --> 4937.218999999999
and again and again

4934.699 --> 4940.219
and even on a micro scale it might

4937.219 --> 4943.34
happen and within like spiritual warfare

4940.219 --> 4946.94
it might happen

4943.34 --> 4949.219
right our dreams that are cultural and

4946.94 --> 4954.0199999999995
they're passed on

4949.219 --> 4956.3
are things too and sometimes dreams are

4954.02 --> 4958.52
even more important to people

4956.3 --> 4960.62
Than Physical things

4958.52 --> 4965.4800000000005
a lot of the time actually especially

4960.62 --> 4968.84
more spiritual people yeah so maybe

4965.48 --> 4973.099999999999
it just applies on many different fronts

4968.84 --> 4976.46
maybe the end times is just a pattern

4973.1 --> 4980.360000000001
a standard pattern

4976.46 --> 4983.719
that was well defined figured out

4980.36 --> 4986.78
everything that would come naturally

4983.719 --> 4988.1
it's a naturally unrolling set of

4986.78 --> 4989.719
effects

4988.1 --> 4992.6
that happen

4989.719 --> 4995.54
again and again and again and it is

4992.6 --> 4998.120000000001
always on the downswing every time that

4995.54 --> 5000.219
starts happening it's it's nature it's a

4998.12 --> 5002.5
fractal of nature that's what I think

5000.219 --> 5005.02
the end times is it's a fractal of

5002.5 --> 5007.96
nature you recognize you're on the

5005.02 --> 5009.9400000000005
downward slope by these elements

5007.96 --> 5013.5
starting to pop up

5009.94 --> 5013.5
that's what I think

5016.9 --> 5023.478999999999
it's a fractal

5019.88 --> 5023.479
[Music]

5027.58 --> 5031.9
get out of cities now yeah arguably it's

5030.76 --> 5033.400000000001
not really going to work in the

5031.9 --> 5034.45
Netherlands though because it's like all

5033.4 --> 5036.879999999999
a giant City

5034.45 --> 5039.88
[Music]

5036.88 --> 5039.88
uh

5044.38 --> 5048.9400000000005
yeah by the way they're trying to like

5046.12 --> 5050.5
freaking attack the farmers here again I

5048.94 --> 5054.219
heard recently

5050.5 --> 5056.159
like in the most Savage bit that the

5054.219 --> 5059.7390000000005
Netherlands has ever seen in its history

5056.159 --> 5062.138999999999
like if this goes through

5059.739 --> 5064.0
like our country will be

5062.139 --> 5066.28
absolutely

5064.0 --> 5069.699
inevitably doomed

5066.28 --> 5070.9
like we will not be we will probably not

5069.699 --> 5073.36
even

5070.9 --> 5076.42
be recognizable in 10 years if that

5073.36 --> 5079.179
happens because they wanted to

5076.42 --> 5081.219
basically start attacking Farmers with

5079.179 --> 5084.219
climate change measures to a level that

5081.219 --> 5087.88
we literally can't have any farming

5084.219 --> 5090.04
anymore in the entire country

5087.88 --> 5092.9800000000005
it's really terrible

5090.04 --> 5095.62
it's the same freaking cabinet and I'm

5092.98 --> 5097.718999999999
I'm getting so sick of these people and

5095.62 --> 5100.239
I'm I'm almost getting sick of the

5097.719 --> 5101.8
opposition it's like oh we need to we

5100.239 --> 5104.799999999999
just need to protest we need to do that

5101.8 --> 5108.6990000000005
or we just arrest these filthy

5104.8 --> 5110.320000000001
infiltrating traitors [ __ ]

5108.699 --> 5114.28
now

5110.32 --> 5117.46
what's stopping you I mean you need an

5114.28 --> 5121.48
arrest team I volunteer I volunteer for

5117.46 --> 5124.06
the arrest team I volunteer when just

5121.48 --> 5126.759999999999
get on with it

5124.06 --> 5128.860000000001
I don't want to hear how we all need to

5126.76 --> 5131.320000000001
protest this protest that and how

5128.86 --> 5134.98
outrageous it is what they do I want

5131.32 --> 5134.98
them arrested

5136.139 --> 5140.58
what's the hold up

5147.94 --> 5153.099999999999
I mean I'm getting really [ __ ] sick

5150.699 --> 5157.379999999999
of this weight

5153.1 --> 5157.38
and who's ever is behind it dude

5158.199 --> 5164.86
You're Gonna Go

5161.38 --> 5170.58
I mean if the freaking royalty is behind

5164.86 --> 5170.58
this [ __ ] from sustaining they gotta go

5172.96 --> 5177.46
they are literally if they're behind

5175.659 --> 5180.28
this and they might be

5177.46 --> 5183.88
then they are literally a no supposed

5180.28 --> 5186.46
Noble line that is actively destroying

5183.88 --> 5190.4800000000005
their Nation to a level

5186.46 --> 5196.4800000000005
where it's incapable of surviving

5190.48 --> 5198.339999999999
yeah that's a royal Caligula situation

5196.48 --> 5201.5199999999995
it must end

5198.34 --> 5204.04
it must end immediately

5201.52 --> 5206.56
and it will be the end of the nobility

5204.04 --> 5208.719
in the Netherlands I mean if that is

5206.56 --> 5210.34
really if they are behind this if they

5208.719 --> 5212.32
are the ones that are preventing this

5210.34 --> 5214.360000000001
from happening through their [ __ ]

5212.32 --> 5215.86
secret surface [ __ ] or whatever that's

5214.36 --> 5218.199
how that works

5215.86 --> 5220.299999999999
it's gonna end then that means the

5218.199 --> 5222.339999999999
Netherlands is going to be a republic

5220.3 --> 5225.639
and there will never be a king again

5222.34 --> 5227.8
like that it's over then you literally

5225.639 --> 5230.4400000000005
wasted it all

5227.8 --> 5232.4800000000005
you wasted it you wasted the opportunity

5230.44 --> 5233.98
you wasted

5232.48 --> 5236.879999999999
everything

5233.98 --> 5236.879999999999
for nothing

5237.28 --> 5243.04
because this is unsustainable and we're

5240.34 --> 5246.12
not going to tolerate it and I volunteer

5243.04 --> 5246.12
for an arrest team

5251.32 --> 5254.159
I mean it

5255.04 --> 5262.84
I I want this to be the last summer

5259.6 --> 5265.54
I want it I I don't want this continuing

5262.84 --> 5266.860000000001
anymore and I don't care if that means

5265.54 --> 5269.739
I'm gonna die

5266.86 --> 5272.5599999999995
I don't care I don't want this to

5269.739 --> 5275.709999999999
continue I don't want it

5272.56 --> 5278.76
has to end I want it to be over

5275.71 --> 5278.76
[Music]

5280.659 --> 5283.32
now

5301.54 --> 5306.639
right

5303.699 --> 5310.419999999999
and I mean it must be doable

5306.639 --> 5313.0
I mean you can't freaking 3D print

5310.42 --> 5314.55
like rocket launchers now

5313.0 --> 5317.86
so

5314.55 --> 5319.3
[Music]

5317.86 --> 5323.099999999999
yeah

5319.3 --> 5323.1
so what are they gonna do then

5336.699 --> 5340.48
foreign

5338.93 --> 5342.639
[Music]

5340.48 --> 5345.699
that's right

5342.639 --> 5349.36
I totally agree I want it Indian style

5345.699 --> 5350.919999999999
there in 306. unfortunately though the

5349.36 --> 5353.5599999999995
Netherlands is like the gayest country

5350.92 --> 5355.12
in the world

5353.56 --> 5357.820000000001
so

5355.12 --> 5359.98
I don't know if it could happen

5357.82 --> 5363.28
anybody that's gonna do it is going to

5359.98 --> 5366.04
be whined about and called Nazis and

5363.28 --> 5369.34
probably end up in some freaking war

5366.04 --> 5373.6
criminal trial for no good reason

5369.34 --> 5376.860000000001
it just has to happen is can't continue

5373.6 --> 5376.860000000001
any longer

5377.37 --> 5381.59
[Music]

5413.62 --> 5418.719
oh yeah clutch well they're not the

5416.32 --> 5421.199
first ones Germany's been doing that for

5418.719 --> 5421.199
a long time

5421.54 --> 5426.639
if I remember correctly

5423.94 --> 5429.54
yeah so it's a sign of communism

5426.639 --> 5429.54
that's what it is

5440.98 --> 5447.099999999999
right that's how you recognize it

5443.98 --> 5448.678999999999
if some tyrannical system

5447.1 --> 5451.3
is

5448.679 --> 5453.159
implementing surreal things that make

5451.3 --> 5458.02
absolutely no sense and make everything

5453.159 --> 5460.36
weird and alien that's communism

5458.02 --> 5462.639
that's Soviet

5460.36 --> 5465.839999999999
that's specifically what how you

5462.639 --> 5465.84
recognize that yeah

5492.87 --> 5496.099999999999
[Music]

5501.54 --> 5504.84
right anyway

5507.52 --> 5514.320000000001
that was also on my mind here and I am

5510.34 --> 5514.32
worried and I am sick of it and I'm

5521.679 --> 5526.179
I don't know what's gonna happen but I

5524.56 --> 5529.659000000001
absolutely hope

5526.179 --> 5533.32
that all this freaking pacifism is gonna

5529.659 --> 5535.12
pass even for us in the Netherlands

5533.32 --> 5537.4
is gonna pass

5535.12 --> 5539.62
it's it's got to be over it's going to

5537.4 --> 5542.739
be over soon

5539.62 --> 5545.86
people have got to break

5542.739 --> 5547.299999999999
that comfort zone and get to the rough

5545.86 --> 5549.28
work

5547.3 --> 5551.38
and quick

5549.28 --> 5555.099999999999
because there's not going to be a

5551.38 --> 5557.139
Netherlands anymore in five years even

5555.1 --> 5559.659000000001
if the [ __ ] that they're putting on the

5557.139 --> 5560.5
agenda on the short term is gonna get

5559.659 --> 5562.719
through

5560.5 --> 5564.88
there's not going to be a Netherlands

5562.719 --> 5567.88
anymore like

5564.88 --> 5567.88
literally

5568.3 --> 5575.52
like the state will become unsustainable

5570.88 --> 5575.52
it will turn into Los Angeles

5577.12 --> 5580.739
if this is all going to get through

5581.199 --> 5586.419999999999
are there any malicious no steamy this

5584.32 --> 5588.4
is the [ __ ] Netherlands

5586.42 --> 5591.6990000000005
this is not Switzerland

5588.4 --> 5595.32
anymore it used to be a bit

5591.699 --> 5595.32
that's a long time ago

5660.76 --> 5663.4800000000005
foreign

5668.62 --> 5673.36
and uh

5671.08 --> 5675.659
I guess I'll keep you guys updated about

5673.36 --> 5675.659

5739.48 --> 5744.339999999999
I'm reading this article here but the

5742.239 --> 5746.5
Netherlands about

5744.34 --> 5747.52
the minister that's actually like doing

5746.5 --> 5750.28
that

disgusting

5791.5 --> 5796.199
disgusting

5793.36 --> 5796.199
[ __ ]

5806.38 --> 5810.28
I think they didn't go far enough they

5808.54 --> 5813.1
should have done it French style and

5810.28 --> 5815.139
just sprayed her entire house with feces

5813.1 --> 5818.619000000001
that's what they should have done just

5815.139 --> 5822.1
poured the [ __ ] out of room

5818.619 --> 5823.239
that's what they should have done but

5822.1 --> 5826.84
no

5823.239 --> 5828.879999999999
I guess it's enough to just stand in the

5826.84 --> 5832.4800000000005
vicinity and then they all [ __ ] their

5828.88 --> 5835.0

ah

5850.6 --> 5859.26
arrested on What charges a treason

5855.699 --> 5863.0199999999995
the deliberate destruction of an entire

5859.26 --> 5865.3
economic sector on which the survival of

5863.02 --> 5867.34
the country is directly dependent

5865.3 --> 5870.52
blatantly

5867.34 --> 5873.400000000001
yeah treason

5870.52 --> 5876.040000000001
you're destroying the country you're

5873.4 --> 5880.36
literally implementing a policy that

5876.04 --> 5884.08
will literally cause the country to stop

5880.36 --> 5886.0599999999995
existing because it can survive if it

5884.08 --> 5887.8
actually goes through yeah

5886.06 --> 5891.1
treason

5887.8 --> 5894.820000000001
there is no reason that they are doing

5891.1 --> 5898.42
that it's all [ __ ] but [ __ ]

5894.82 --> 5901.9
climate change you stupid [ __ ] nobody

5898.42 --> 5905.8
believed that lie it's a lie the seed

5901.9 --> 5909.159
never Rose yeah [ __ ] 70 years of that

5905.8 --> 5913.8
propaganda horse [ __ ] the [ __ ] sea

5909.159 --> 5918.5199999999995
level has never changed you stupid [ __ ]

5913.8 --> 5920.88

get the [ __ ] out of my country you

5935.139 --> 5940.9890000000005
treacherous hag

5937.8 --> 5940.9890000000005
[Music]

5957.1 --> 5959.820000000001
ah

5961.0 --> 5968.94
yeah I'm not a big fan of

5964.719 --> 5968.94
most politicians here in the Netherlands

5969.76 --> 5974.619000000001
it's just

5971.02 --> 5977.139
I tend to despise them more than the

5974.619 --> 5979.0599999999995
average anti-flat earther I mean I'd

5977.139 --> 5982.179
rather spend a day

5979.06 --> 5985.119000000001
together with akumu virus

5982.179 --> 5988.119
hearing his denial [ __ ] all day long

5985.119 --> 5992.199
then listening to like more than 10

5988.119 --> 5995.739
minutes of these deluded [ __ ] freaks

5992.199 --> 5997.419999999999
these inside out demons they literally

5995.739 --> 6000.54
don't know what the hell they're doing

5997.42 --> 6002.639
like they consciously don't know

6000.54 --> 6006.239
they're deranged they're so they're like

6002.639 --> 6008.46
Beyond social justice Warriors insane

6006.239 --> 6011.699
okay beyond that

6008.46 --> 6014.82
think of the insanity out there and then

6011.699 --> 6017.638999999999
think of it four times smarter but still

6014.82 --> 6021.659
just as insane that's what these [ __ ]

6017.639 --> 6026.06
politicians are they're insane

6021.659 --> 6026.0599999999995
they should all be arrested

6026.82 --> 6031.679
their treasonous

6029.219 --> 6033.42
they're destroying the country they're

6031.679 --> 6036.2390000000005
destroying the economy they're

6033.42 --> 6039.4800000000005
destroying the livelihoods

6036.239 --> 6040.678999999999
of people that work hard here to keep it

6039.48 --> 6042.48
all going

6040.679 --> 6047.179
they're destroying the food supply

6042.48 --> 6047.178999999999
they're just they're just attacking

6049.44 --> 6056.699
and it needs to stop I don't want to

6053.46 --> 6058.38
hear this [ __ ] about oh we go to protest

6056.699 --> 6063.5
this now oh no we're going to protest

6058.38 --> 6065.46
that no [ __ ] arrest them already

6063.5 --> 6068.639
Trey tarse

6065.46 --> 6070.619
their entire agenda is blatantly

6068.639 --> 6074.04
treacherous

6070.619 --> 6074.9
they're attacking the cohesion of our

6074.04 --> 6078.9
country

6074.9 --> 6078.9
directly economic

6079.199 --> 6083.599999999999
it needs to stop

6091.98 --> 6096.178999999999
yeah I'm not even bringing in the whole

6094.5 --> 6100.02
covet [ __ ]

6096.179 --> 6100.02
I'm not even I

6104.639 --> 6108.84
is there a lot of hunger and

6106.199 --> 6110.28
homelessness in the Netherlands

6108.84 --> 6112.619000000001
no

6110.28 --> 6116.04
it's actually really well taken care of

6112.619 --> 6120.239
you know why because the people

6116.04 --> 6123.08
want to take care of it

6120.239 --> 6126.299999999999
and so industry here

6123.08 --> 6131.58
voluntary helping people

6126.3 --> 6133.9800000000005
I'm not doing that personally but like

6131.58 --> 6135.78
a lot of people are doing it and that's

6133.98 --> 6137.459999999999
the really what's keeping things stable

6135.78 --> 6141.179
is all that

6137.46 --> 6143.04
is that people can and do actually just

6141.179 --> 6145.7390000000005
help out a lot of people

6143.04 --> 6146.94
and make sure yeah there there is plenty

6145.739 --> 6150.959999999999
of food

6146.94 --> 6152.759999999999
why because we still have a pretty good

6150.96 --> 6156.9
agriculture

6152.76 --> 6160.56
and we have meat industry too and like

6156.9 --> 6164.159
it's high grade it's it's like not

6160.56 --> 6167.280000000001
polluted it's non-GMO mostly even yeah

6164.159 --> 6170.638999999999
there's a thriving organic farming

6167.28 --> 6172.739
industry here it's doing really well

6170.639 --> 6175.139
all these people that have dedicated

6172.739 --> 6177.419999999999
their lives to it and they're like

6175.139 --> 6178.38
really improving upon what was already

6177.42 --> 6181.32
there

6178.38 --> 6184.1990000000005
it's a thriving industry and they're now

6181.32 --> 6188.04
trying to destroy it again

6184.199 --> 6191.219
the politicians they're destroying it

6188.04 --> 6194.179
all that actual wealth and knowledge on

6191.219 --> 6194.179
how to do that

6198.239 --> 6202.259999999999
so no there is not a lot of hunger and

6200.34 --> 6205.4400000000005
homelessness here in the Netherlands

6202.26 --> 6208.619000000001
because we're like very proudly super

6205.44 --> 6210.86
social on average

6208.619 --> 6214.5
we do actually take care of those people

6210.86 --> 6217.44
and we don't like try to exploit them

6214.5 --> 6219.86
constantly like in the United States is

6217.44 --> 6219.86
the norm

6221.28 --> 6223.699
right

6229.5 --> 6234.9
and now we still get like Refugee

6231.9 --> 6238.619
influxes every now and then

6234.9 --> 6241.199
but still it's kept within I guess

6238.619 --> 6244.739
reasonable proportions

6241.199 --> 6248.638999999999
because yeah they're we're not like

6244.739 --> 6251.218999999999
a giant slum zone of refugees like some

6248.639 --> 6253.08
places in France or Belgium right we're

6251.219 --> 6255.36
not that

6253.08 --> 6257.699
but it's because everybody's been like

6255.36 --> 6260.179
really fighting to prevent that from

6257.699 --> 6260.178999999999
happening

6261.36 --> 6265.219
it's been a struggle all the way

6277.02 --> 6280.52
now you're talking about

6309.239 --> 6311.48
foreign

6314.639 --> 6317.2390000000005
foreign

6320.63 --> 6323.779
[Music]

6342.719 --> 6346.02
thank you

6344.699 --> 6349.259999999999
no

6346.02 --> 6351.84
I'm not gonna I'm not gonna

6349.26 --> 6353.88
care this is

6351.84 --> 6356.28
you think I'm gonna let you ruin it

6353.88 --> 6358.8
again you filthy scumbag

6356.28 --> 6362.179
huh no

6358.8 --> 6362.179
no not this time

6364.199 --> 6367.919999999999
the Netherland sounds like a pretty nice

6365.94 --> 6371.54
place to live yeah it is

6367.92 --> 6371.54
it's it's pretty good

6376.679 --> 6381.179
there's just a lot of indoctrination

6379.679 --> 6383.76
happening

6381.179 --> 6386.04
and it's like a higher level

6383.76 --> 6388.679
indoctrination as in it's much more

6386.04 --> 6391.0199999999995
difficult to just put it aside

6388.679 --> 6394.1990000000005
right like

6391.02 --> 6397.7390000000005
if you're kind of a not too bright a

6394.199 --> 6398.879999999999
person and you get in here you have no

6397.739 --> 6402.718999999999
chance

6398.88 --> 6405.42
you will be indoctrinated and you will

6402.719 --> 6408.7390000000005
fall in line of a group and there's

6405.42 --> 6412.08
nothing you can do about it

6408.739 --> 6414.36
nothing you can do to stop that because

6412.08 --> 6415.699
the indoctrination level that happened

6414.36 --> 6420.54
here

6415.699 --> 6423.78
are so sophisticated and dark in ways

6420.54 --> 6427.139
there's just nothing you can do

6423.78 --> 6430.44
there's if you're not really smart

6427.139 --> 6432.659000000001
and like I get a grip on psychological

6430.44 --> 6435.419999999999
work you will

6432.659 --> 6436.379999999999
you will end up in a standardized group

6435.42 --> 6439.4400000000005
here

6436.38 --> 6441.96
and there's nothing you can do about it

6439.44 --> 6445.32
because the indoctrination levels are

6441.96 --> 6448.32
Savage Savage level

6445.32 --> 6449.759999999999
I've never seen anything like it out

6448.32 --> 6452.759999999999
there

6449.76 --> 6455.6990000000005
it's so sophisticated and and like

6452.76 --> 6458.76
standardized like like people are just

6455.699 --> 6461.159
put into a certain Railroad and they

6458.76 --> 6463.6990000000005
can't leave it anymore it just they

6461.159 --> 6463.699
can't do it

6471.119 --> 6478.5599999999995
and yeah I deal with it constantly every

6475.199 --> 6481.199
person every person out there

6478.56 --> 6484.4400000000005
they can't step out of their boundaries

6481.199 --> 6486.48
if they're even halfway integrated with

6484.44 --> 6487.678999999999
how things work out there if they have

6486.48 --> 6490.5599999999995
jobs

6487.679 --> 6494.34
they have social media

6490.56 --> 6495.6
they are all stuck they're all stuck in

6494.34 --> 6498.179
it

6495.6 --> 6500.76
and they can't get out

6498.179 --> 6504.06
all stuck and they can't get out

6500.76 --> 6505.7390000000005
they can't leave certain ways of doing

6504.06 --> 6508.38
things

6505.739 --> 6511.32
they can't step out of that it's part of

6508.38 --> 6514.02
the reason that I've kept out

6511.32 --> 6517.5599999999995
is because of that influence

6514.02 --> 6520.52
because I did not want it to break me

6517.56 --> 6520.52
and it would have

6524.88 --> 6528.139
hey Daniel Robles

6536.58 --> 6541.08
does Netherlands place any restrictions

6538.56 --> 6546.1990000000005
on religion

6541.08 --> 6546.199
uh it's complicated not really

6552.06 --> 6560.34
but yeah there is a strong influence of

6555.48 --> 6562.199
the Jews but that's like traditional

6560.34 --> 6566.52
I've mentioned it before that's like

6562.199 --> 6567.719
that's kind of how the country started

6566.52 --> 6570.320000000001
so

6567.719 --> 6570.32
yeah

6571.08 --> 6576.0
it's like if something is like hyper

6573.56 --> 6578.820000000001
anti-dew or something then it's not

6576.0 --> 6581.28
gonna manifest here but there's a lot of

6578.82 --> 6584.719
different religions and there's like

6581.28 --> 6584.719
the Islam as well

6585.0 --> 6587.42
right

6591.96 --> 6599.719
but it's like yeah Nazis are like real

6596.3 --> 6603.4800000000005
overworked Nazis are not accepted here

6599.719 --> 6607.099
and yeah I can't say it I completely

6603.48 --> 6607.098999999999
disagree with that stance

6608.34 --> 6613.679
I mean it is a mess especially what has

6611.28 --> 6615.78
become so

6613.679 --> 6618.06
and yeah you could call it a religion

6615.78 --> 6622.0199999999995
but pretty much everything else is like

6618.06 --> 6626.54
all kinds of religions here all kinds

6622.02 --> 6626.540000000001
like even in this one city there's like

6630.42 --> 6635.58
the different different types of

6632.46 --> 6637.86
churches different types of mosques

6635.58 --> 6639.84
that I've seen I don't know if there's

6637.86 --> 6642.42
like a

6639.84 --> 6644.219
yeah but there's of course the Church of

6642.42 --> 6647.099
Latter-day Saints which is like very

6644.219 --> 6648.4800000000005
much represented here as well and

6647.099 --> 6651.06
uh

6648.48 --> 6653.759999999999
I don't know if there's any synagogues

6651.06 --> 6655.9800000000005
no idea but I'm sure in Amsterdam

6653.76 --> 6658.639
there's going to be synagogue so yeah

6655.98 --> 6658.638999999999
uh

6661.26 --> 6665.159000000001
there's a yeah the Buddha temple you

6663.3 --> 6666.96
know the Buddhists they come walking by

6665.159 --> 6669.5
sometimes so

6666.96 --> 6669.5
what else

6670.679 --> 6677.099
I'm pretty sure there's other

6673.5 --> 6680.28
types of religious religions as well

6677.099 --> 6682.32
I mean Freemasonry is also very much

6680.28 --> 6684.119
represented in the Netherlands

6682.32 --> 6688.219
this is

6684.119 --> 6688.219
you would think we might have started it

6689.58 --> 6692.36
uh

6693.54 --> 6699.119
so no there aren't really any

6696.06 --> 6700.26
restrictions on religions other than no

6699.119 --> 6703.44
aggression

6700.26 --> 6705.92
it's like religious aggression is not

6703.44 --> 6705.919999999999
accepted

6706.199 --> 6714.598999999999
uh

6708.84 --> 6714.599
although yeah sometimes political fields

6714.98 --> 6719.58
aggression sometimes does happen and

6717.719 --> 6722.599
then it's just like thrown on politics

6719.58 --> 6722.599
rather than religion

6723.0 --> 6728.4
but yeah

6725.4 --> 6730.46
there's not a lot of like aggression in

6728.4 --> 6732.9
general I think in the Netherlands I'm

6730.46 --> 6735.119
decently happy about that

6732.9 --> 6737.759999999999
up until the point that you realize that

6735.119 --> 6741.299999999999
everybody's become too passive and gay

6737.76 --> 6744.179
to even stop the maniacal treacherous

6741.3 --> 6747.3
demon government

6744.179 --> 6749.219
that's literally trying to destroy our

6747.3 --> 6752.820000000001
very foundations

6749.219 --> 6757.02
on purpose for no damn good reason other

6752.82 --> 6759.599
than World economic Forum bucking

6757.02 --> 6762.139
so

6759.599 --> 6762.139
yeah

6778.83 --> 6781.939
[Music]

6798.199 --> 6804.199
a church of Latter-day Saints that's

6801.78 --> 6808.099
That's mildly funny

6804.199 --> 6808.098999999999
hello Renaissance driver

6823.5 --> 6831.0
what do they have that we really need

6827.52 --> 6832.619000000001
you mean the religions

6831.0 --> 6835.159
community

6832.619 --> 6835.159
right

6836.219 --> 6840.06
that's that's pretty much it it's the

6838.619 --> 6842.58
community

6840.06 --> 6844.679
that's the thing that yeah that's what

6842.58 --> 6847.699
you will find

6844.679 --> 6847.6990000000005
in a religion

6848.88 --> 6851.4800000000005
a community

6852.9 --> 6857.5199999999995
right

6854.099 --> 6859.02
it's what I found even for a while when

6857.52 --> 6861.119000000001
I went to the Church of Latter-day

6859.02 --> 6864.719
Saints

6861.119 --> 6866.46
I I really needed that community and I

6864.719 --> 6869.52
needed there

6866.46 --> 6873.0
are like free spirit that's not dwelling

6869.52 --> 6875.34
on darkness which I was doing a lot and

6873.0 --> 6878.4
I I was being haunted by it and it

6875.34 --> 6881.159000000001
literally went to them to like please

6878.4 --> 6885.36
Please Release Me From This darkness and

6881.159 --> 6888.48
they did and it was good for a while

6885.36 --> 6889.739
and it did like kind of permanently help

6888.48 --> 6891.9
me

6889.739 --> 6894.48
but then I discovered that yeah they

6891.9 --> 6898.32
have their own weird issues

6894.48 --> 6900.9
the individuals and and there was also

6898.32 --> 6904.4
just like Globe infiltration so there's

6900.9 --> 6904.4
political infiltration there

6904.56 --> 6912.4800000000005
globe Pro Ukraine [ __ ] all that hot just

6909.92 --> 6915.0
atrocious garbage

6912.48 --> 6917.879999999999
yeah so that happens there too and that

6915.0 --> 6921.38
is made me like in like that makes me

6917.88 --> 6921.38
literally spit at the ground

6922.08 --> 6930.119
like in front of them like you are

6925.92 --> 6932.76
part of a beast system now

6930.119 --> 6934.86
this is not a proper church this is not

6932.76 --> 6938.280000000001
of Christ you are literally political

6934.86 --> 6940.44
[ __ ] now you don't know what the hell

6938.28 --> 6942.78
it is you're doing you didn't know what

6940.44 --> 6945.0599999999995
the hell it was you were doing with the

6942.78 --> 6947.5199999999995
whole covet crisis you were cooking for

6945.06 --> 6949.02
that too and then the Ukraine [ __ ]

6947.52 --> 6951.4800000000005
happened and you were cooking for that

6949.02 --> 6954.4800000000005
too those people you don't you guys

6951.48 --> 6957.839999999999
there you're all nice people you don't

6954.48 --> 6960.54
know what the hell it is you're doing

6957.84 --> 6962.6990000000005
you're you're lost

6960.54 --> 6966.619
and you're being led

6962.699 --> 6966.619
by a traitor to Christ

6969.06 --> 6972.900000000001
somebody that makes you do all that is

6971.76 --> 6975.0
not

6972.9 --> 6977.098999999999
is not with Christ

6975.0 --> 6979.739
they're with politics

6977.099 --> 6982.6990000000005
and power play and money

6979.739 --> 6982.699
not with Christ

6986.3 --> 6993.0
so yeah that's part of the reason I left

6990.119 --> 6994.739
I couldn't just I didn't want to sit

6993.0 --> 6996.96
through that anymore

6994.739 --> 6999.36
they removed the piano and put some

6996.96 --> 7001.119
stupid organ in there that I don't like

6999.36 --> 7004.82
the sound off I really liked the piano

7001.119 --> 7006.86
so now I just don't go there anymore

7004.82 --> 7008.84
and I yeah I don't go there anymore just

7006.86 --> 7011.36
in time before they started to [ __ ] in

7008.84 --> 7012.9800000000005
the most atrocious ways possible it

7011.36 --> 7016.159
started with the freaking Globe getting

7012.98 --> 7019.759999999999
taught about the globe in the class in

7016.159 --> 7022.5199999999995
the freaking church that's idiotic

7019.76 --> 7023.780000000001
I even spoke up against it like this is

7022.52 --> 7026.3
not biblical

7023.78 --> 7027.259999999999
this is not in the Bible you know it

7026.3 --> 7029.599
isn't

7027.26 --> 7032.119000000001
and he would be like the Romper

7029.599 --> 7034.219
stuttering it was like you should be

7032.119 --> 7035.78
embarrassed of yourself I literally told

7034.219 --> 7037.76
it to his face

7035.78 --> 7040.42
everybody was

7037.76 --> 7042.8
and I was right

7040.42 --> 7045.08
unrelenting that's how I like to do

7042.8 --> 7046.46
things I never talked to him again after

7045.08 --> 7050.0
that

7046.46 --> 7051.44
he knew he was wrong and he did it

7050.0 --> 7055.099
anyway

7051.44 --> 7059.0
I do not respect like the head figure of

7055.099 --> 7061.82
that church at all I do not respect him

7059.0 --> 7064.46
he is not a Christian in my opinion

7061.82 --> 7066.199
as I would define it

7064.46 --> 7067.699
right

7066.199 --> 7070.098999999999
and yeah

7067.699 --> 7072.0199999999995
and then yeah after I don't really go

7070.099 --> 7073.9400000000005
there anymore that's when the covet [ __ ]

7072.02 --> 7076.280000000001
started and they were cocking

7073.94 --> 7078.259999999999
immediately

7076.28 --> 7080.42
idiotic

7078.26 --> 7082.9400000000005
and then after that they were talking to

7080.42 --> 7086.36
the Ukraine situation and it's just like

7082.94 --> 7088.5199999999995
this is not my church

7086.36 --> 7090.5
this is embarrassing you should all be

7088.52 --> 7094.3
embarrassed about yourself

7090.5 --> 7094.3
for for being part of this

7105.5 --> 7109.84
against me joining years ago no

7110.719 --> 7116.84
me joining no

7113.96 --> 7119.719
no I didn't want to join

7116.84 --> 7121.34
I had objections to certain things I'm

7119.719 --> 7124.04
free

7121.34 --> 7126.7390000000005
and I will not be laid to a very

7124.04 --> 7128.239
specific set of beliefs that I cannot

7126.739 --> 7130.839999999999
argue

7128.239 --> 7130.839999999999
right

7133.4 --> 7139.42
is I can't do it

7135.56 --> 7139.42
and I'm more aware of it now

7139.94 --> 7147.04
like I I am not going to

7143.42 --> 7151.36
become a part of something that

7147.04 --> 7151.36
uses beliefs as true

7151.76 --> 7159.26
when it is inarguable

7155.06 --> 7162.38
I will not be bound to any aberration

7159.26 --> 7165.139
Priestly or otherwise I will not bind

7162.38 --> 7168.26
myself to them no matter what

7165.139 --> 7171.02
I will only stick to things that I can

7168.26 --> 7174.08
understand that I can foresee to

7171.02 --> 7177.02
understand it's very important

7174.08 --> 7178.88
because I have a very unique sense I

7177.02 --> 7181.88
think it's Unique and not the only one

7178.88 --> 7184.88
but I'm like really good with it where I

7181.88 --> 7187.6990000000005
know like I am going to understand this

7184.88 --> 7190.9400000000005
because this is cohesive even though I

7187.699 --> 7195.259999999999
do not have a full oversight I know from

7190.94 --> 7198.4
what I see that it will make sense to me

7195.26 --> 7200.119000000001
and I can't just immediately

7198.4 --> 7203.0199999999995
differentiate

7200.119 --> 7203.0199999999995
immediately

7204.08 --> 7208.04
and that's how I do things I do not

7206.239 --> 7211.419999999999
accept things

7208.04 --> 7211.42
that I do not understand

7213.92 --> 7220.6990000000005
unless I know that I will understand

7217.4 --> 7223.96
yeah that sounds a bit mystical I can't

7220.699 --> 7223.96
say it any other way

7227.68 --> 7233.0
[Music]

7230.54 --> 7234.739
so no my father and stepmom weren't

7233.0 --> 7237.45
against me joining I don't know where

7234.739 --> 7240.639999999999
you're getting that from

7237.45 --> 7240.639999999999
[Music]

7243.32 --> 7248.179
I mean they weren't like encouraging me

7245.659 --> 7249.739
to join they were like kind of neutral

7248.179 --> 7252.92
they were like oh okay

7249.739 --> 7255.799999999999
well yeah maybe Community would be good

7252.92 --> 7258.34
for you or not

7255.8 --> 7258.34
right

7259.25 --> 7265.599
[Music]

7261.38 --> 7265.599
communities and citadels yeah yeah

7279.5 --> 7283.82
all right maybe steamy trout I don't

7282.38 --> 7285.86
know where you got that maybe from an

7283.82 --> 7288.799999999999
old show

7285.86 --> 7290.78
maybe they were cautioning me

7288.8 --> 7292.820000000001
like are you sure you want to join

7290.78 --> 7295.34
because I think at the at the start I

7292.82 --> 7298.58
really wanted to join

7295.34 --> 7303.02
but then yeah I started bumping into the

7298.58 --> 7306.92
things into the things that showed like

7303.02 --> 7309.56
you might wanna hold on to making that

7306.92 --> 7312.139
decision for a while you might just want

7309.56 --> 7314.360000000001
to postpone that for a bit just look at

7312.139 --> 7318.639
who these people are first

7314.36 --> 7318.639
before you bind yourself to them

7320.96 --> 7326.179
and I think that yeah my parents were

7323.84 --> 7329.06
kind of noticing that about me that it

7326.179 --> 7332.7390000000005
was like really eager to join

7329.06 --> 7332.7390000000005
and then they were cautioning me

7337.099 --> 7341.92
autism

7338.54 --> 7341.92
do about not joining

7349.94 --> 7352.78
I don't remember

7353.96 --> 7358.0
I don't remember even getting that far

7366.5 --> 7371.96
I think they were just cautioning me

7369.08 --> 7374.48
because yeah as I was like preparing

7371.96 --> 7376.82
myself to become part of that

7374.48 --> 7379.098999999999
I bumped into things and people's

7376.82 --> 7382.659
responses that were just alarming like

7379.099 --> 7382.659000000001
this is not right

7405.44 --> 7409.46
I think that

7407.119 --> 7411.0199999999995
at the time it was kind of critical to

7409.46 --> 7413.78
me like

7411.02 --> 7416.599
there would have to be flat earthers

7413.78 --> 7420.139
like I don't want to join a Christian

7416.599 --> 7424.400000000001
Community that isn't flat earther

7420.139 --> 7426.8
there will be no freaking talk of balls

7424.4 --> 7429.98
in my church

7426.8 --> 7433.159000000001
that's my personal demand

7429.98 --> 7433.929999999999
will be no talk of balls in my church

7433.159 --> 7437.049
ever

7433.93 --> 7437.049
[Music]

7437.42 --> 7442.88
and yeah and then they proceeded to do

7440.42 --> 7446.02
that and that was kind of like a breaker

7442.88 --> 7446.02
a deal breaker to me

7461.179 --> 7464.1990000000005
so yeah

7465.56 --> 7471.02
and you remember like

7468.38 --> 7473.42
so when is that show

7471.02 --> 7474.8
that's like the flatter talk days or

7473.42 --> 7478.099
something that's

7474.8 --> 7480.7390000000005
did you like recently watch a video

7478.099 --> 7484.599
back or something steamy Traveler

7480.739 --> 7484.598999999999
because I don't even remember that

7485.96 --> 7489.28
that's a long time ago

7510.27 --> 7513.4890000000005
[Music]

7523.88 --> 7529.159000000001
uh yeah and just for the record for any

7526.76 --> 7532.34
trolls come out there nobody's haunting

7529.159 --> 7534.98
my dreams my dreams are perfect

7532.34 --> 7537.8
my dreams are great sometimes they're

7534.98 --> 7540.619
really freaking weird and surreal

7537.8 --> 7542.84
I had a really weird really creepy weird

7540.619 --> 7545.0599999999995
dream like that yesterday

7542.84 --> 7549.38
but it was not

7545.06 --> 7551.84
scary because of Mr troll influence

7549.38 --> 7555.5
just for the record okay

7551.84 --> 7557.54
because you can't do [ __ ] to me

7555.5 --> 7559.28
the only thing you can do is try to

7557.54 --> 7561.079
project things in my direction the only

7559.28 --> 7563.3
thing that's going to happen is it's

7561.079 --> 7566.179
gonna get you a feedback loop You're

7563.3 --> 7567.38
Gonna Get Zapped

7566.179 --> 7568.6990000000005
right

7567.38 --> 7571.76
you're gonna get

7568.699 --> 7575.419999999999
it back times three

7571.76 --> 7578.599
because I don't even do anything towards

7575.42 --> 7581.4800000000005
trolls other than get really

7578.599 --> 7584.84
disgusted by them I have a personal

7581.48 --> 7587.659
response to it I never actually

7584.84 --> 7590.599
like I'm not gonna waste my spiritual

7587.659 --> 7591.98
Purity or anything on doing anything to

7590.599 --> 7594.7390000000005
them

7591.98 --> 7598.0599999999995
what a waste of energy that will be like

7594.739 --> 7598.0599999999995
what a waste of purity

7598.28 --> 7600.699
right

7603.739 --> 7610.82
but in the moment

7607.219 --> 7614.659
the moment you appear and I choose to

7610.82 --> 7616.88
address you I will insert

7614.659 --> 7618.86
certain things

7616.88 --> 7622.3
that are gonna stick to your mind

7618.86 --> 7622.299999999999
whatever's left of it

7624.199 --> 7626.678999999999
right

7628.579 --> 7634.219
no

7630.5 --> 7636.739
I'm just gonna leave that one there

7634.219 --> 7639.26
pathetic

7636.739 --> 7642.32
nobody's haunting my dreams in my dreams

7639.26 --> 7645.400000000001
I am the master

7642.32 --> 7645.4
I am in control

7645.98 --> 7653.839999999999
and it hasn't actually been anything

7648.82 --> 7658.0599999999995
different from that in over 20 years

7653.84 --> 7658.06
and some of them are really scary

7658.52 --> 7664.76
but yeah that's called confrontation

7662.84 --> 7667.159000000001
it's not like I'm not in control it's

7664.76 --> 7669.26
not scary because I'm not in control I

7667.159 --> 7671.659
am in control in my dreams and there's

7669.26 --> 7674.96
nobody haunting me

7671.659 --> 7676.4
I am haunted Way Beyond what you could

7674.96 --> 7679.46
understand

7676.4 --> 7681.92
probably before you were even born

7679.46 --> 7683.599
things that I've seen and that I don't

7681.92 --> 7686.42
share

7683.599 --> 7688.82
yeah you can't haunt me

7686.42 --> 7692.36
you don't even have the spiritual

7688.82 --> 7693.679
capacity to actually do that

7692.36 --> 7697.04
you understand

7693.679 --> 7699.079
because you're a scored boy Pretender

7697.04 --> 7703.239
clown

7699.079 --> 7703.239
you don't even have an identity

7703.46 --> 7711.199
you're just a waste of space in a chat

7707.719 --> 7714.26
on a live stream of a guy

7711.199 --> 7716.9
that's like not even that widely known

7714.26 --> 7719.360000000001
so you're just a waste of space you'd

7716.9 --> 7721.04
have no power you cannot haunt anybody's

7719.36 --> 7723.5599999999995
dreams

7721.04 --> 7725.239
you're not saying anything that could

7723.56 --> 7727.6990000000005
haunt me

7725.239 --> 7730.94
you don't even understand me enough to

7727.699 --> 7733.879999999999
be able to do that you see

7730.94 --> 7737.0599999999995
what I can point out how you function

7733.88 --> 7741.02
perfectly and that is

7737.06 --> 7744.1990000000005
the thing that haunts you you see

7741.02 --> 7746.4400000000005
to those who live their lives in the

7744.199 --> 7746.44
shadow

7746.659 --> 7753.5599999999995

7758.96 --> 7764.619
[ __ ]

7760.42 --> 7764.619
wannabe sorcerer huh

7767.42 --> 7770.8

7772.52 --> 7776.9800000000005

7774.26 --> 7776.9800000000005
squirting on yourself

7793.76 --> 7799.42
the least threatening man you've ever

7796.159 --> 7799.42
seen wow

7803.659 --> 7811.0
well from a person that's not even a

7806.84 --> 7811.0
person that doesn't mean anything

7819.38 --> 7823.34
Pastor Dean oodle preaches ATV I don't

7822.199 --> 7825.199
lose that

7823.34 --> 7826.52
is that an American creature never heard

7825.199 --> 7830.0199999999995
of him

7826.52 --> 7830.02
or vaguely heard him

7846.619 --> 7853.219
you know what is the

7849.38 --> 7854.96
the ultimate undoer of threats

7853.219 --> 7858.86
when you know

7854.96 --> 7861.7390000000005
so when you know and that's not claim or

7858.86 --> 7864.619
portrayed to the outside world when you

7861.739 --> 7867.759999999999
actually know somebody is just always

7864.619 --> 7867.759999999999
lying about everything

7868.639 --> 7874.82
like this scumbag in my chat that's just

7872.78 --> 7876.92
trolling me and think they can get under

7874.82 --> 7879.259999999999
my skin and

7876.92 --> 7885.639
and they're not even creative enough to

7879.26 --> 7885.639
be amusing in any way they're just lame

7889.28 --> 7893.78
I'm not thinking about you I'm

7891.98 --> 7897.98
describing you

7893.78 --> 7902.0599999999995
I'm describing you with accuracy

7897.98 --> 7905.959999999999
I'm displaying your function

7902.06 --> 7910.099
to make you seen for what you really are

7905.96 --> 7912.9800000000005
to make people see through the very very

7910.099 --> 7915.679
cheap disguise that you think gives you

7912.98 --> 7918.86
some kind of a power

7915.679 --> 7922.639
in the meantime I'm right here everybody

7918.86 --> 7925.219
knows who I am I'm here daily I'm stable

7922.639 --> 7928.219
keep returning I show you all my things

7925.219 --> 7930.9800000000005
all my internal things even my

7928.219 --> 7934.04
vulnerabilities because I'm not afraid

7930.98 --> 7935.419999999999
because I'm not a cowardly piece of [ __ ]

7934.04 --> 7937.82
gamma

7935.42 --> 7938.96
that can't even come out with an

7937.82 --> 7941.96
identity

7938.96 --> 7943.82
because there are two cowardly

7941.96 --> 7947.06
you see

7943.82 --> 7951.0199999999995
you don't even have an identity

7947.06 --> 7953.84
you're just a squirt boy in a corner

7951.02 --> 7956.719
nobody knows who they are they just know

7953.84 --> 7960.679
you suck and nothing you says have you

7956.719 --> 7962.659
say have any value ever

7960.679 --> 7965.56
I mean you don't even have an identity

7962.659 --> 7965.5599999999995
you're nothing

7970.19 --> 7973.36
[Music]

7975.219 --> 7980.0
and bite him out

7977.54 --> 7982.46
Howard you're saying I'm gonna guess

7980.0 --> 7985.099
you're Sean Hawkins

7982.46 --> 7987.199
John Hawkins loves that word he loves

7985.099 --> 7989.719
the word coward because he needs to

7987.199 --> 7992.96
project it constantly he's haunted by

7989.719 --> 7995.3
his own coward as you see haunted by it

7992.96 --> 7999.02
so he has to say that he has to accuse

7995.3 --> 8002.56
everybody of say of being that just to

7999.02 --> 8007.0
have some short-term relief

8002.56 --> 8011.099
of knowing that he is like a really

8007.0 --> 8011.099
really terrible pathetic coward

8014.619 --> 8017.4
see

8027.46 --> 8033.76
12 year that's a bit overwritten

8031.9 --> 8035.379999999999
more like

8033.76 --> 8038.9400000000005
10.

8035.38 --> 8038.9400000000005
12 is a bit High

8041.86 --> 8048.42
but yeah arrest development

8044.619 --> 8048.42
provable palpable

8050.199 --> 8057.579
nine yeah it's about South Park H right

8054.699 --> 8059.799999999999
you think you can get away with anything

8057.579 --> 8063.159
because you don't have the faculties yet

8059.8 --> 8066.6990000000005
to actually realize that doing things

8063.159 --> 8068.619
is yeah has value and implications and

8066.699 --> 8070.86
consequences you don't think about that

8068.619 --> 8070.86
yet

8074.619 --> 8080.32
see yeah

8076.84 --> 8085.0
I know I know you are yeah

8080.32 --> 8088.179
because I have actual power I have grip

8085.0 --> 8089.44
I understand things and people I

8088.179 --> 8092.26
remember

8089.44 --> 8098.919999999999
details and understand them and will

8092.26 --> 8101.8
understand more about them in the future

8098.92 --> 8105.04
you get it no you don't get it because

8101.8 --> 8108.04
you're Sean Hawkins sock puppet

8105.04 --> 8108.04
underwhelming

8120.94 --> 8125.379999999999
all right but hey

8122.98 --> 8128.0199999999995

8125.38 --> 8129.9400000000005
up man come on do it then nobody's ever

8128.02 --> 8132.46
done that so far right

8129.94 --> 8133.839999999999
because I don't care I don't care what

8132.46 --> 8135.34
you're gonna look like I don't care if

8133.84 --> 8137.8
you're like a Beefcake if you look

8141.04 --> 8146.139
yeah I might look small

8143.679 --> 8148.0
compared to you maybe although I doubt

8146.139 --> 8151.42
that those types of people would

8148.0 --> 8154.02
actually even have this kind of behavior

8151.42 --> 8156.34
it's usually really pathetic

8154.02 --> 8158.38
underwhelming people that do these

8156.34 --> 8162.360000000001
things in other people's chats

8158.38 --> 8162.36
Why'd You Come and face me yeah

8166.84 --> 8171.52
sidewalk

8168.579 --> 8174.639
yeah if you insist I'll do that

8171.52 --> 8176.860000000001

8189.94 --> 8194.559
that you could just do it anywhere just

8192.46 --> 8198.039999999999
whenever you bump into me I'm not afraid

in the direction of facing off going

8233.519 --> 8240.359
revealing anything you're just gonna

8236.2 --> 8240.359
hang and whine in the background

8286.719 --> 8291.819
after a certain point if you're that

8289.059 --> 8294.518999999998
wrong it becomes a talent

8291.819 --> 8296.74
like how many incorrect things can you

8484.96 --> 8488.8
that's not even saying anything

8486.58 --> 8491.62

accepting that people can be that

8513.22 --> 8517.72
[ __ ] you see

8516.1 --> 8521.319
I have trouble

8517.72 --> 8524.38

8521.319 --> 8526.779999999999
about creation that God

8524.38 --> 8529.358999999999

8548.5 --> 8552.04
just another challenge and that's what
