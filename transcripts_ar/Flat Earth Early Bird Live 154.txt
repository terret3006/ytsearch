[Music]

40.379 --> 49.269
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

44.559 --> 53.07899999999999
early-bird number 154 I'm your host

49.269 --> 56.44
Arwen and before I start the show

53.079 --> 59.019
please don't regret don't forget to

60.729 --> 70.17
live and yeah please support me on super

66.88 --> 77.399
chat from my PayPal and on patreon and

70.17 --> 77.399
yeah don't forget to share the show so

77.46 --> 84.759
yeah today it's kind of the same as

82.39 --> 87.069
yesterday it's still kind of sunny now

84.759 --> 89.92
right now that just seems to be a cloud

87.069 --> 93.27
going over it's a little bit fresh

89.92 --> 94.84
little warmer than yesterday but still

93.27 --> 99.57
nice spring day

94.84 --> 109.27000000000001
oh look at those trees it's awesome

99.57 --> 115.53899999999999
but yeah big cloud over there so OH at a

109.27 --> 118.39
crazy night so silly of me I've been up

115.539 --> 123.039
so incredibly late I literally stayed up

118.39 --> 127.09
until I saw the Morning Glory it's kind

123.039 --> 130.56
of foolish of me but yeah Netflix again

127.09 --> 138.579
I just kept on watching and watching

130.56 --> 143.799
turn out to be unexpectedly good so yeah

138.579 --> 150.579
and Nathan's new daughter clover it's

143.799 --> 158.78
just born I saw the photo on the master

150.579 --> 164.08
beat yet yeah awesome

158.78 --> 171.47
six pounds eight Nathan says so

164.08 --> 173.81
congratulations yeah I'm probably gonna

171.47 --> 177.65
be a bit slow in relation to the

173.81 --> 181.85
previous days cuz yeah man staying up

177.65 --> 185.21
that late like I'm slightly disoriented

181.85 --> 195.85999999999999
I shouldn't do that again let's just go

185.21 --> 199.94
to bed on time this is ridiculous ah yes

195.86 --> 202.28
stache Moretz I do I do know that and

199.94 --> 204.25
I've already been ducks everybody knows

202.28 --> 207.26
where I live I'm pretty open about it

204.25 --> 209.93
not gonna like name my very address

207.26 --> 215.45
every single time but I know and I don't

209.93 --> 222.68
give a [ __ ] because yeah people can know

215.45 --> 225.85999999999999
who I am and where I am okay yeah

222.68 --> 228.76000000000002
yes that's moretz I know I've been doing

225.86 --> 228.76000000000002
it for three years

233.569 --> 244.28
and I'm not afraid I'm not afraid to be

236.54 --> 246.95
identified okay and I'm not afraid to

244.28 --> 250.519
face brawlers in the real world as well

246.95 --> 262.34
not just over the Internet I'm not

250.519 --> 265.19
intimidated okay ha so let's see who's

262.34 --> 267.94
in chat a lot of people a lot of people

265.19 --> 267.94
in check

305.74 --> 316.0
right yes sorry for being a bit slow

310.38 --> 318.04
let's see how do I do this trying to get

316.0 --> 322.59
to my own video but I should have opened

318.04 --> 322.59000000000003
it up before I started the Hangout oh

323.58 --> 341.46999999999997
well enough to figure a way around it

329.82 --> 344.44
let's see right there we go yeah all

341.47 --> 353.49
right let's see who's in chat okay Steve

344.44 --> 353.49
righteous force James Mays Rambo Jambo

356.85 --> 369.56
love it back and forth here Robert cats

362.28 --> 378.27
ipis am i UK Johnson dou T over mu KU

369.56 --> 381.09
stairs Moretz of course peanuts clerk be

378.27 --> 383.33
rational and candor yeah good morning to

381.09 --> 383.33
you all

385.28 --> 396.5
so yeah yesterday was a blast

389.57 --> 396.5
my first premiere was pretty good

400.279 --> 406.329
what switch hangouts are you talking

403.459 --> 406.329
about hon Carlos

412.19 --> 420.77
I accidentally had the back-up hangout

416.12 --> 422.63
which I used to create the panel I left

420.77 --> 425.29999999999995
it up normally I delete that before I

422.63 --> 426.77
start so I don't have two streams at the

425.3 --> 430.42
same time it's kind of annoying when

426.77 --> 435.28999999999996
that happens because I get a split and

430.42 --> 437.12
yeah nobody yeah everyone that goes on

435.29 --> 437.45000000000005
the other hangout there's no registry of

437.12 --> 441.23
that

437.45 --> 443.47999999999996
so please do always visit the flat earth

441.23 --> 447.94
early bird live version because that's

443.48 --> 450.59000000000003
the real that's the real show not the

447.94 --> 452.51
yeah the show title without the life in

450.59 --> 464.23999999999995
it because that's just my back panel

452.51 --> 470.84
it's gonna be taken down so yeah again

464.24 --> 474.29
the the premiere yesterday I did kind of

470.84 --> 477.10999999999996
get a bit repetitive but it's kind of

474.29 --> 481.82
necessary when literally you get had red

477.11 --> 485.21000000000004
herring every step of the way and I I

481.82 --> 488.87
just couldn't get over it and still I

485.21 --> 491.29999999999995
can that they just that even rumpus

488.87 --> 493.7
started to just declare that you didn't

491.3 --> 497.0
need a viewing function for the

493.7 --> 500.15
curvature calculator and then literally

497.0 --> 505.28
step by step he described how he would

500.15 --> 510.04999999999995
use the the results and compare them

505.28 --> 512.7189999999999
literally literally without any pre

510.05 --> 516.26
calculations he didn't describe that

512.719 --> 519.38
part any time without any calculations

516.26 --> 521.539
in between to transform it to a

519.38 --> 523.46
perspective view or anything he would

521.539 --> 526.31
compare the raw results with the real

523.46 --> 529.46
thing he said they all said it could

526.31 --> 532.0999999999999
yeah it's the same it's similar the

529.46 --> 536.27
results are similar so it must be that

532.1 --> 538.85
they literally said that and yeah

536.27 --> 540.65
completely ignored that you if you do

538.85 --> 543.9200000000001
that then you're certainly gonna apply a

540.65 --> 545.55
viewing function to an orthographic view

543.92 --> 549.149
which does not account

545.55 --> 551.31
a viewing function and just because it

549.149 --> 554.279
has all happens to look very similar

551.31 --> 557.279
doesn't mean that it must be exactly the

554.279 --> 560.43
same and they just did not respond to

557.279 --> 563.279
this at all so that was what the yeah

560.43 --> 564.87
most of the our video was about when I

563.279 --> 568.829
went on Jose's channel and I thought

564.87 --> 571.5
yeah I did pretty well didn't get all

568.829 --> 574.26
the optics details and words exactly

571.5 --> 578.49
right but yeah I openly admit that's

574.26 --> 581.3389999999999
just find that very difficult all of

578.49 --> 583.44
that it's so much different things to

581.339 --> 585.0600000000001
take into account I've completely forgot

583.44 --> 588.0
to mention even the influence of

585.06 --> 590.0889999999999
refraction and air clarity and all that

588.0 --> 594.6
completely even forgot to mention that

590.089 --> 598.35
the entire video but yeah just the

594.6 --> 604.339
perspective based effects alone have a

598.35 --> 609.24
dramatic influence um yeah how a picture

604.339 --> 611.5200000000001
is going to turn out yeah when you

609.24 --> 617.64
compare yeah when when it's an actual

611.52 --> 619.38
viewing function based pictures so well

617.64 --> 622.17
yeah I was pretty satisfied about it

619.38 --> 625.77
I'm gonna jet got a generous superjet

622.17 --> 629.37
donation as well so I'm happy and maybe

625.77 --> 633.06
I'll try something like this more often

629.37 --> 635.25
just jump in somewhere in challenging

633.06 --> 638.2199999999999
panel but I did I really yeah I really

635.25 --> 639.6
felt like biting in so I was ready for

638.22 --> 642.36
it had a lot of energy there were no

639.6 --> 643.9200000000001
debates life and just thought like yeah

642.36 --> 649.86
you know what screw it I'm gonna do this

643.92 --> 651.5999999999999
and turn out great hey Nathan Oakley how

649.86 --> 656.75
are you doing good morning or good

651.6 --> 656.75
afternoon for you for us both really

656.9 --> 672.6999999999999
oh I love awakening in the studio starik

668.18 --> 672.6999999999999
dust samus

675.7 --> 679.6500000000001
uh happy irrational

681.66 --> 695.54
Oh God right so yeah all right be

688.56 --> 700.4399999999999
rational trigonometry is a geometric

695.54 --> 705.06
calculation and that works just fine

700.44 --> 712.32
when you use an auto graphic view it

705.06 --> 713.6099999999999
works out but whatever you're going to

712.32 --> 717.9000000000001
apply it on if you don't have any

713.61 --> 721.62
confirmation of a size or the actual

717.9 --> 727.35
distance then yeah you're gonna be doing

721.62 --> 730.95
guesswork presuppose it like with all of

727.35 --> 733.89
the heavenly bodies cell that's why

730.95 --> 737.1
trigonometry despite being a very useful

733.89 --> 740.78
tool in the physical realm if you're

737.1 --> 743.1
gonna apply it to the heavenly bodies

740.78 --> 746.3399999999999
presupposing the earth is a globe and

743.1 --> 750.57
that their surrounding that globe at a

746.34 --> 754.26
specific type of distance yeah it's very

750.57 --> 756.36
useful to assume all kinds of things

754.26 --> 758.1
about them but yeah if you don't free

756.36 --> 760.17
suppose a globe you just have the

758.1 --> 763.35
angular relations and that is really all

760.17 --> 765.4799999999999
that you have and just an angular

763.35 --> 769.9200000000001
relation that doesn't give you any hint

765.48 --> 772.29
as to a size or an actual distance so

769.92 --> 775.88
you can't really apply trigonometry

772.29 --> 779.4499999999999
without presupposing some kind of model

775.88 --> 779.45
that's the whole issue

781.889 --> 787.08
yeah

783.89 --> 787.08
[Music]

800.639 --> 809.009
ah yes be rational lots of presupposing

804.839 --> 811.379
going on explained it many times it's

809.009 --> 813.869
been repeated over and over and over and

811.379 --> 818.429
over again to no end on the flat earth

813.869 --> 822.4200000000001
debates like for a long time now pretty

818.429 --> 823.22
much since a half a year after it

822.42 --> 826.2199999999999
started

823.22 --> 826.22
definitely

828.299 --> 840.329
I'm currently little too to drain to

834.869 --> 843.149
completely keep repeating that over and

840.329 --> 844.829
over again expecting you to get it at

843.149 --> 846.929
all because you're probably not because

844.829 --> 850.4989999999999
otherwise you've gotten or yeah I

846.929 --> 854.249
already explained it fully if you don't

850.499 --> 856.559
get it after that then yeah then your

854.249 --> 858.799
cognitive dissonance is just holding you

856.559 --> 858.799
back

861.34 --> 864.509
[Music]

884.57 --> 889.1400000000001
yeah I should time you out for that kind

887.49 --> 894.66
of [ __ ] after everything that's

889.14 --> 896.64
happened it's so it's so [ __ ] that

894.66 --> 898.4699999999999
you're still saying this after

896.64 --> 899.76
everything that's happened just in the

898.47 --> 903.77
last 24 hours

899.76 --> 903.77
it's so stupid

920.29 --> 923.2199999999999
all right

926.94 --> 934.75
[Music]

928.78 --> 937.9599999999999
well okay flood Aamir Nabokov is that

934.75 --> 940.12
real because it's if it's not I'm gonna

937.96 --> 943.96
ban you because you're you've been

940.12 --> 951.85
misbehaving in my chat very badly in the

943.96 --> 957.57
last few days and this is some kind of

951.85 --> 957.57
really bad joke then you're out of here

959.73 --> 968.64
yet whatever you just said is he dead

967.2 --> 972.3900000000001
okay

968.64 --> 972.39
that's not the same

975.5 --> 984.98
so he's not dead because then you're out

979.61 --> 986.9
of here I don't want you to talk like

984.98 --> 990.16
that in my chat it's really disgusting

986.9 --> 990.16
and misleading

999.04 --> 1005.06
all right so

1002.25 --> 1005.06
see ya

1007.41 --> 1020.31
you can talk to me on the debates yes

1016.41 --> 1022.1999999999999
flip master 2019 you can ask me

1020.31 --> 1025.309
something go ahead

1022.2 --> 1025.309
[Music]

1030.7 --> 1038.38
yeah I'm sorry to hear that tinfoil hat

1034.73 --> 1038.38
sir that's weird

1067.22 --> 1070.369
[Music]

1075.83 --> 1085.889
mmm-no be irrational MMS is not just

1081.33 --> 1088.1999999999998
bleach it's a very specific type you

1085.889 --> 1092.609
don't just take any bottle out of the

1088.2 --> 1095.1290000000001
grocery store and do it with that or if

1092.609 --> 1098.4189999999999
you do you have to follow very specific

1095.129 --> 1102.509
instructions and only from the original

1098.419 --> 1106.3200000000002
person that divides the method don't

1102.509 --> 1108.33
just here's anyone out telling you just

1106.32 --> 1109.889
on the fly how to do it you got to

1108.33 --> 1115.769
really look into it gotta be careful

1109.889 --> 1117.869
there's special special type of bottles

1115.769 --> 1120.809
with that stuff specifically for that

1117.869 --> 1123.599
medical process and I've done it myself

1120.809 --> 1126.33
and it works really well but it is

1123.599 --> 1131.09
disgusting and I don't recommend to do

1126.33 --> 1131.09
it like on a permanent basis or anything

1137.21 --> 1144.2
yeah the irrational its peroxide and

1141.28 --> 1149.47
peroxide is also a component that is

1144.2 --> 1156.32
used as bleach in household cleaning

1149.47 --> 1162.26
things but yet it works it does work it

1156.32 --> 1165.74
I don't know exactly how it works I

1162.26 --> 1170.87
don't remember it I used it like 6 years

1165.74 --> 1175.3700000000001
ago and what it does it somehow yeah it

1170.87 --> 1180.85
it works very quickly and yeah it can

1175.37 --> 1185.54
fight off like bad immune responses

1180.85 --> 1188.7199999999998
infections and like sickness conditions

1185.54 --> 1195.6499999999999
I don't know even why it does that but

1188.72 --> 1197.96
it does it and yeah from what I remember

1195.65 --> 1201.8600000000001
it has to do with that it's basically

1197.96 --> 1205.16
peroxide and it's the ox the oxygen

1201.86 --> 1210.11
element to it that does the effect and

1205.16 --> 1212.44
it purges it urges your intestines I

1210.11 --> 1212.4399999999998
think

1217.1 --> 1225.289
there's even other ways to do it without

1220.07 --> 1230.3799999999999
using bleach like for example let me

1225.289 --> 1234.11
show for a moment but in the Alex Jones

1230.38 --> 1236.72
store in the info war store there's been

1234.11 --> 1239.4499999999998
a product that's been there from very

1236.72 --> 1243.5
from the from the very beginning even

1239.45 --> 1246.38
before x2 and that is oxy pills that's

1243.5 --> 1249.5
basically the same thing but based on

1246.38 --> 1252.74
another ID it's not bleach based but it

1249.5 --> 1255.009
is the same effect at it and it really

1252.74 --> 1255.009
works

1258.37 --> 1269.05
all right in dioxis all rights uh be

1264.1 --> 1271.53
rational sorry my mistake that I got the

1269.05 --> 1275.23
chemistry wrong but I know it has

1271.53 --> 1280.72
dioxide right it's it's about the oxide

1275.23 --> 1282.91
anyway all right well be rational when

1280.72 --> 1284.97
it comes to the products that are being

1282.91 --> 1288.309
sold

1284.97 --> 1294.179
yeah the vast majority of them is very

1288.309 --> 1298.42
trustworthy and some of them are yeah

1294.179 --> 1301.929
like a little experimental and maybe

1298.42 --> 1306.01
slightly exaggerated or over generalized

1301.929 --> 1307.7800000000002
as to how that influences you but yeah

1306.01 --> 1311.4
many of his products are absolutely

1307.78 --> 1315.55
trustworthy and I wish I had bought

1311.4 --> 1320.44
these oxide pills that he has because I

1315.55 --> 1322.48
yeah I know it I know it works for that

1320.44 --> 1325.8400000000001
from other sources as well but yeah

1322.48 --> 1328.679
before that product was even brought to

1325.84 --> 1331.27
my attention on the alexion show

1328.679 --> 1333.0700000000002
but yeah it's a little expensive and

1331.27 --> 1336.04
there's like other things I'd rather

1333.07 --> 1338.6789999999999
have even because I don't really need

1336.04 --> 1341.1
that my overall medical condition is

1338.679 --> 1341.1000000000001
pretty good

1344.27 --> 1347.329
[Music]

1348.36 --> 1357.9099999999999
so yeah you can Oh bleep it's so creepy

1353.2 --> 1360.07
yeah but it's no for generalization it's

1357.91 --> 1363.52
not like just freaking drink out of

1360.07 --> 1367.1789999999999
those bottles or anything and yeah it's

1363.52 --> 1370.87
a very careful but tested process and it

1367.179 --> 1378.789
works the only problem is it's

1370.87 --> 1381.1899999999998
disgusting yeah and I don't give a [ __ ]

1378.789 --> 1383.4089999999999
if it's illegal or people are going to

1381.19 --> 1385.5700000000002
be jailed because of it just because

1383.409 --> 1394.9
there's a medical tyranny doesn't mean

1385.57 --> 1398.559
that it doesn't work okay it's the same

1394.9 --> 1402.52
thing goes for colloidal silver it works

1398.559 --> 1405.52
it really works some people respond

1402.52 --> 1409.6
better to it than others but there's

1405.52 --> 1411.549
like never really a negative effect yeah

1409.6 --> 1415.36
unless somebody turns out to have like

1411.549 --> 1418.45
silver allergies which as far as I know

1415.36 --> 1422.049
don't even exist because what is

1418.45 --> 1426.07
generally said to be silver allergy is

1422.049 --> 1428.559
usually nickel allergy in bad quality

1426.07 --> 1430.99
silver with nickel in it and that has

1428.559 --> 1433.12
like the illogical response to it that

1430.99 --> 1435.1200000000001
is very visible and everything they call

1433.12 --> 1438.4599999999998
that silver because it's basically

1435.12 --> 1440.7399999999998
jewelry that kind of looks like silk but

1438.46 --> 1442.48
it's not it's bad silver and I don't

1440.74 --> 1446.32
think that people really have real

1442.48 --> 1446.95
allergies with silver not that I can

1446.32 --> 1449.95
recall

1446.95 --> 1453.76
and you know so but silver works but yet

1449.95 --> 1456.97
if a doctor will start to use that apply

1453.76 --> 1461.4089999999999
that to to remedy infections or anything

1456.97 --> 1464.3500000000001
yeah he will be brought to the boards of

1461.409 --> 1466.2700000000002
medical blah blah blah and he would risk

1464.35 --> 1469.8999999999999
losing his license and you have to

1466.27 --> 1473.62
apologize in all that [ __ ] but it

1469.9 --> 1476.13
works nonetheless it's just the medical

1473.62 --> 1478.6
tyranny they don't allow you to use

1476.13 --> 1482.5
cheap alternative things

1478.6 --> 1483.9399999999998
work really well and make yeah most of

1482.5 --> 1486.28
the medical industrial complex

1483.94 --> 1496.63
completely superfluous and unnecessary

1486.28 --> 1501.9289999999999
oh my god be rational it's not silver

1496.63 --> 1505.5100000000002
chloride you ask you freaking idiot

1501.929 --> 1507.94
it's colloidal silver that's pure atomic

1505.51 --> 1510.1
silver it's there is no freaking

1507.94 --> 1515.14
chlorine it's dissolved in distilled

1510.1 --> 1518.5
water it's a freaking straw man the blue

1515.14 --> 1523.1200000000001
man is a straw man they picked up that

1518.5 --> 1525.669
idiot and then said he was taking

1523.12 --> 1527.6499999999999
colloidal silver it's a complete lie and

1525.669 --> 1530.3200000000002
by the way it's silver nitrate nothing

1527.65 --> 1532.5700000000002
chlorine as far as I know what he took

1530.32 --> 1534.85
and that turning blue because he would

1532.57 --> 1538.48
took way too much of it and yeah you

1534.85 --> 1541.8999999999999
don't respond well to that salt when

1538.48 --> 1548.14
it's not in its atomic form and he was

1541.9 --> 1551.77
taking too much of it anyway yeah a

1548.14 --> 1556.39
little silver tumeric amazing things and

1551.77 --> 1560.28
there's even more iodine you know this

1556.39 --> 1560.2800000000002
stuff really good

1577.88 --> 1584.42
sure be rational sure we have that but I

1582.23 --> 1586.94
wasn't we were talking about colloidal

1584.42 --> 1592.5800000000002
silver not the general content of

1586.94 --> 1594.95
people's blood you're misleading you're

1592.58 --> 1597.32
misleading everyone it's really annoying

1594.95 --> 1599.72
or you are just misled yourself a year

1597.32 --> 1602.3899999999999
just repeating your misprogrammed

1599.72 --> 1604.25
nonsense that could also be the case I

1602.39 --> 1606.74
know what I'm talking about when it

1604.25 --> 1611.75
comes to alternative medicine okay I've

1606.74 --> 1615.23
been into that [ __ ] for 25 years I was

1611.75 --> 1617.42
taught by my mother for starters it's

1615.23 --> 1619.16
one of the the things she taught me and

1617.42 --> 1623.1200000000001
it was a very terrible student because I

1619.16 --> 1626.93
was always getting distracted but I did

1623.12 --> 1629.6299999999999
kind of pay attention that did take note

1626.93 --> 1632.5700000000002
like yeah this [ __ ] does work she did

1629.63 --> 1634.67
try out remedies using plants I

1632.57 --> 1637.82
participated in that and it damn well

1634.67 --> 1641.15
worked so I know from experience it

1637.82 --> 1644.03
works I was girl I grew up trusting that

1641.15 --> 1647.8100000000002
and then the internet happened and all

1644.03 --> 1653.6299999999999
these new things were there to check out

1647.81 --> 1657.52
and then YouTube so yeah I learned a lot

1653.63 --> 1657.5200000000002
in the last few decades

1661.62 --> 1667.53
we before a flatter stay on the time

1665.25 --> 1673.65
when I was still imagine building Space

1667.53 --> 1681.77
Station so yeah I can't really put that

1673.65 --> 1681.77
on flatters hmm

1696.919 --> 1701.75
all right yeah

1739.06 --> 1747.58
right yeah thanks for the support

1743.32 --> 1750.96
ma UK and I agree it's very difficult if

1747.58 --> 1759.3999999999999
you get entangled in pharmacological

1750.96 --> 1762.73
processes in medicines yeah then it's

1759.4 --> 1766.69
very easy to get entangled in all kinds

1762.73 --> 1769.63
of medical situations and then once you

1766.69 --> 1772.21
get in that it's very difficult to get

1769.63 --> 1774.13
out of it and potentially dangerous so I

1772.21 --> 1776.98
would never just recommend somebody

1774.13 --> 1779.71
figuring this out like oh yeah no just

1776.98 --> 1782.44
all put it away immediately never use it

1779.71 --> 1784.42
again and just use something else

1782.44 --> 1790.6000000000001
instead because that'll shock your

1784.42 --> 1793.21
system so never do that but yeah see how

1790.6 --> 1796.6299999999999
you can eliminate every type of

1793.21 --> 1799.57
pharmacological medicine one by one see

1796.63 --> 1804.67
what the medical system is presuming it

1799.57 --> 1807.04
is doing and then figure out is there

1804.67 --> 1808.9
another way to approach that problem or

1807.04 --> 1811.6299999999999
is that problem even a side-effect of

1808.9 --> 1815.44
another condition yeah figure it out

1811.63 --> 1818.95
it's usually a big puzzle to figure out

1815.44 --> 1822.46
how to step down your pharmacological

1818.95 --> 1824.56
medicated condition and transit it's

1822.46 --> 1826.75
kind of complicated if yeah if you're

1824.56 --> 1828.82
really into like three or four different

1826.75 --> 1831.64
type of pharmacological medicines then

1828.82 --> 1833.8
you've already got a big problem but you

1831.64 --> 1838.2900000000002
can do it it just takes some time and

1833.8 --> 1838.29
careful planning and figuring out

1843.58 --> 1851.74
and and also there are some conditions

1847.93 --> 1855.39
still like permanent conditions that

1851.74 --> 1860.08
people are born with that have like

1855.39 --> 1866.6200000000001
pharmacological responses to it like say

1860.08 --> 1869.56
diabetes that yeah I don't really know

1866.62 --> 1871.9599999999998
how to yeah you can I don't know any a

1869.56 --> 1874.4199999999998
good alternative for all any of them

1871.96 --> 1877.69
really although I do know there's

1874.42 --> 1883.15
probably some herbal things you can try

1877.69 --> 1887.44
to for example restore diabetes certain

1883.15 --> 1889.99
types restore that function but yeah

1887.44 --> 1892.21
don't it's been a while so there's so

1889.99 --> 1896.44
many things you can do and there's like

1892.21 --> 1899.2
thing you can regenerate functions and

1896.44 --> 1902.5
organ functions of your body even that

1899.2 --> 1904.6000000000001
by allopathic medicine standards just

1902.5 --> 1907.69
once they go there is no way back

1904.6 --> 1909.25
according to their system well in

1907.69 --> 1912.3700000000001
reality there is

1909.25 --> 1917.02
it's just they get flustered by it it's

1912.37 --> 1918.4599999999998
one of those moments like a person is as

1917.02 --> 1921.07
cancer it has been scanned and

1918.46 --> 1925.18
everything and he's just like yes screw

1921.07 --> 1926.83
that I'll figure it out myself you know

1925.18 --> 1929.65
and they go away and after two months

1926.83 --> 1932.9499999999998
back and like okay scan again it's gone

1929.65 --> 1934.8400000000001
and the doctors like whoa but I've never

1932.95 --> 1938.74
seen that happened how did you do that

1934.84 --> 1940.78
and either like okay keep on doing that

1938.74 --> 1946.96
or they just shut up completely

1940.78 --> 1950.8
embarrassed because their system tells

1946.96 --> 1953.89
them these things cannot be cured it

1950.8 --> 1956.3799999999999
doesn't give recognition that it can it

1953.89 --> 1958.63
just refutes the claims about that

1956.38 --> 1961.3000000000002
doesn't really have an answer that's how

1958.63 --> 1966.16
it works it's their programming it's

1961.3 --> 1969.19
like a religious programming that they

1966.16 --> 1972.21
have to comply to it has to fit in their

1969.19 --> 1976.06
specific medical conceptual system and

1972.21 --> 1976.71
that system is flawed by default because

1976.06 --> 1980.6689999999999
it is

1976.71 --> 1983.159
Pathak it is symptom driven and very

1980.669 --> 1992.249
elaborate but it's not holistic in

1983.159 --> 1997.8600000000001
nature not really so yeah some medical

1992.249 --> 1999.99
conditions may not be gotten alternative

1997.86 --> 2002.779
versions for it that could actually cure

1999.99 --> 2007.19
it not everything is curable that as far

2002.779 --> 2010.19
as I can confirm maybe anything can be

2007.19 --> 2012.169
cured but not that I know of there's

2010.19 --> 2017.96
still some conditions out there just

2012.169 --> 2022.3690000000001
like I don't know it's very uncertain if

2017.96 --> 2027.559
you could ever get out of that but I'm

2022.369 --> 2030.58
still in the what it's snowing what the

2027.559 --> 2037.6689999999999
hell check this out

2030.58 --> 2040.24
it's freaking snowing that's crazy okay

2037.669 --> 2040.24
see that

2056.929 --> 2060.869
anyway the snow does melt like

2059.309 --> 2062.6690000000003
immediately as soon as it touches

2060.869 --> 2065.9700000000003
anything so it's nothing to leave

2062.669 --> 2068.3689999999997
anything like it's just gonna be malted

2065.97 --> 2073.819
snow everywhere but what the [ __ ]

2068.369 --> 2076.349
snowing I guess in its April so yeah

2073.819 --> 2079.339
shouldn't be too surprised April has

2076.349 --> 2083.039
crazy weather in the Netherlands always

2079.339 --> 2090.349
they basically say April does what it

2083.039 --> 2090.349
wants well it wants snow apparently

2099.699 --> 2111.549
it's pretty serious I don't know if you

2102.349 --> 2114.549
could see anything about it but it's

2111.549 --> 2114.549
definitely

2118.64 --> 2127.2999999999997
oh and pieces of hail as well it's a

2124.1 --> 2127.2999999999997
mixed bag of weird

2134.48 --> 2137.23
all right

2137.25 --> 2146.35
okay so after criticizing Big Pharma and

2143.82 --> 2150.4300000000003
praising alternative medicine making

2146.35 --> 2153.73
some disclaimers I would like to

2150.43 --> 2157.56
emphasize however that allopathic

2153.73 --> 2161.14
medicine definitely does have a function

2157.56 --> 2165.0
in my opinion but it's kind of narrow

2161.14 --> 2171.49
and that is emergency emergency

2165.0 --> 2176.1
situations like accidents well we have

2171.49 --> 2178.93
like accidents or spontaneous unknown

2176.1 --> 2179.94
conditions things like heart attack -

2178.93 --> 2184.54
that kind of thing

2179.94 --> 2187.51
yeah there's alternative medicine is

2184.54 --> 2189.0299999999997
very much about letting the body heal

2187.51 --> 2191.0800000000004
properly

2189.03 --> 2193.57
restoring that but if there's an

2191.08 --> 2196.36
emergency or if there's open wounds yeah

2193.57 --> 2199.92
you damn well want a real doctor and a

2196.36 --> 2203.82
surgeon and all that's very very very

2199.92 --> 2206.53
important that these professions exist

2203.82 --> 2210.51
but the problem is is that it's become

2206.53 --> 2214.96
an industry and it's profiteering

2210.51 --> 2218.32
getting more work and money out of ya

2214.96 --> 2221.41
people that don't really need it with

2218.32 --> 2226.4100000000003
just minor conditions them poisoning

2221.41 --> 2229.75
themselves through pharmacological drugs

2226.41 --> 2231.3999999999996
causing them eventually to likely one

2229.75 --> 2236.62
way or the other end up on surgery

2231.4 --> 2241.4700000000003
tables it's it's not good it's not a

2236.62 --> 2244.21
good situation but yeah we do need some

2241.47 --> 2249.58
amount of allopathic medicine because

2244.21 --> 2251.95
symptom driven healing yeah you that's

2249.58 --> 2255.0699999999997
what that's basically all you gotta got

2251.95 --> 2256.75
to go on the moment somebody is unstable

2255.07 --> 2260.4700000000003
they had an accident they have damage

2256.75 --> 2263.32
yeah that's certainly the way to go in

2260.47 --> 2265.8599999999997
emergencies but outside of emergencies

2263.32 --> 2265.86
no

2266.599 --> 2273.44
so I would suggest for the future when

2269.79 --> 2278.96
it comes to medical system to find a

2273.44 --> 2282.39
in-between way get the general healing

2278.96 --> 2285.54
method what people go to for the doctor

2282.39 --> 2288.2999999999997
with ailments and use hirable remedies

2285.54 --> 2290.94
and a widespread amount of alternative

2288.3 --> 2293.6090000000004
options and there are so many approaches

2290.94 --> 2296.52
so many different angles now options

2293.609 --> 2299.67
they're just not even heard of in your

2296.52 --> 2303.75
general public that should be given an

2299.67 --> 2306.27
option and insured maybe whatever the

2303.75 --> 2308.34
country works like are just part of free

2306.27 --> 2313.08
market products however you want to do

2308.34 --> 2316.9100000000003
that and yeah still have some backup for

2313.08 --> 2321.3199999999997
the allopathic medicine in in hospitals

2316.91 --> 2324.8999999999996
emergency rooms that kind of thing and

2321.32 --> 2328.23
just try to find and yeah a good

2324.9 --> 2335.099
in-between way maybe even try to convert

2328.23 --> 2341.19
the allopathic concept with injecting

2335.099 --> 2343.589
certain alternative replacements making

2341.19 --> 2347.4900000000002
it slightly more holistic staving off

2343.589 --> 2349.589
many of the symptoms just reworking it

2347.49 --> 2352.9799999999996
it could be done and yeah you could have

2349.589 --> 2358.5299999999997
a fantastic modern medical system really

2352.98 --> 2363.96
good that's just where doctors make

2358.53 --> 2366.3590000000004
doctors great again you know I I would

2363.96 --> 2368.58
much rather prefer to have doctors

2366.359 --> 2372.99
everywhere that you could actually ask

2368.58 --> 2376.19
for a reliable advising and not be lured

2372.99 --> 2378.54
in some kind of medical death Pitts

2376.19 --> 2381.0
without the doctors even really

2378.54 --> 2383.72
realizing most of the time because

2381.0 --> 2388.94
they're just following their procedures

2383.72 --> 2388.9399999999996
so yeah make doctors great again

2391.28 --> 2407.4300000000003
now make allopathic medicine great

2396.0 --> 2410.66
against memoy hmm anyway yeah it's

2407.43 --> 2410.66
enough of that for now

2425.19 --> 2427.849
yeah

2427.93 --> 2437.9199999999996
all right serious Steve that's bizarre

2431.549 --> 2443.14
remember grantee broke here two ribs

2437.92 --> 2445.329
from coughing so I guess it does it can

2443.14 --> 2447.3689999999997
happen so maybe somebody did break their

2445.329 --> 2456.27
lips from laughing must have been pretty

2447.369 --> 2458.619
freaking hilarious then yeah thanks leb

2456.27 --> 2462.46
thanks for the compliment yeah it was a

2458.619 --> 2464.2000000000003
good it was a good run I'm kind of proud

2462.46 --> 2467.71
of how it went even though I didn't make

2464.2 --> 2469.6299999999997
mistakes but I didn't take [ __ ] I really

2467.71 --> 2473.289
almost felt like Nathan like I was

2469.63 --> 2478.9500000000003
Nathan raging trying not to blow out my

2473.289 --> 2478.9500000000003
voice even and was pretty loud at times

2479.039 --> 2485.2000000000003
this mic can take a lot of noise right

2482.44 --> 2491.349
away because I was literally screaming

2485.2 --> 2494.3689999999997
like this like right in front of it over

2491.349 --> 2494.369
rumbling rumpus

2495.51 --> 2499.2000000000003
hey lolz

2520.76 --> 2527.8100000000004
yeah you I know I am yeah oh my god

2524.45 --> 2530.81
look the video I premiered yesterday was

2527.81 --> 2533.15
up until the points that Jose basically

2530.81 --> 2534.89
said thanks and goodbye and I thought oh

2533.15 --> 2537.44
this is a perfect ending I timed it

2534.89 --> 2541.46
pretty well if I say so myself but yeah

2537.44 --> 2545.77
after that they kept on talking for very

2541.46 --> 2548.54
long time and they were whoa

2545.77 --> 2552.5
absolutely disgustingly revoltingly

2548.54 --> 2556.55
discussed it was so bad they were so

2552.5 --> 2559.49
arrogant and just patronizing to the

2556.55 --> 2562.28
maximum potential to the point that they

2559.49 --> 2564.41
were declaring Flat Earth a religion

2562.28 --> 2568.61
again and that we just don't understand

2564.41 --> 2572.27
it was so disgusting it just I left that

2568.61 --> 2578.4500000000003
out just for to make it a better average

2572.27 --> 2583.4
video oh my god these people like after

2578.45 --> 2585.98
everything they just they just do that

2583.4 --> 2591.77
as a contrast because they really did

2585.98 --> 2594.92
look very bad if you actually approach

2591.77 --> 2597.83
it objectively and neutrally I really

2594.92 --> 2599.63
see what is said the arguments what they

2597.83 --> 2601.61
do what they don't do if you're honest

2599.63 --> 2603.56
about that yeah they look terrible so

2601.61 --> 2605.9300000000003
that's why I mirrored it because I

2603.56 --> 2612.14
thought it was pretty pretty successful

2605.93 --> 2614.6
in defense of Flat Earth but yeah then

2612.14 --> 2616.52
what they always do afterward is just

2614.6 --> 2618.77
once they get their room and the other

2616.52 --> 2621.41
parties going they just oh talk behind

2618.77 --> 2627.1
their back that just basically jack off

2621.41 --> 2631.64
in ace self victory declaring disgusting

2627.1 --> 2635.08
megalomaniacal circle-jerk it's just so

2631.64 --> 2637.97
revoked they do it every time just I

2635.08 --> 2641.39
don't know maybe it's almost like a pep

2637.97 --> 2642.47
talk to themselves like yeah doesn't

2641.39 --> 2644.12
really matter we still have the

2642.47 --> 2647.8999999999996
consensus and they're just [ __ ]

2644.12 --> 2651.2599999999998
everybody on our side with the consensus

2647.9 --> 2653.27
is gonna take our word for it because

2651.26 --> 2654.44
they're on our side and they probably

2653.27 --> 2656.66
don't really

2654.44 --> 2658.67
what's going on anyway so we can just do

2656.66 --> 2660.5589999999997
this and everybody will feel good about

2658.67 --> 2662.51
themselves and really smart for

2660.559 --> 2666.02
believing in the globe and that's just

2662.51 --> 2667.67
what they do it's automated it's an

2666.02 --> 2669.91
automated process it's not even

2667.67 --> 2674.0
something they really plan out or

2669.91 --> 2677.21
afterwards discuss like yeah did we did

2674.0 --> 2679.73
we properly distract the argument no

2677.21 --> 2682.67
they'd probably don't even see it for

2679.73 --> 2686.619
what it really is but they do feel it

2682.67 --> 2689.63
out and they are just intuitively

2686.619 --> 2692.0
improvising that part and consciously

2689.63 --> 2696.829
focusing mostly on the technicalities of

2692.0 --> 2698.059
the contents of their beliefs but when

2696.829 --> 2701.27
it comes to their feelings and their

2698.059 --> 2703.369
conscious they're just not really seeing

2701.27 --> 2706.67
what they're doing actually they just

2703.369 --> 2710.089
look past it they just do it impulsively

2706.67 --> 2713.829
and routinely it's weird it's a very

2710.089 --> 2713.8289999999997
weird way to do things

2731.28 --> 2737.55
you know Daniel we do things very

2733.44 --> 2739.13
differently do we don't do it the same

2737.55 --> 2742.5600000000004
way at all

2739.13 --> 2749.46
don't you see the contrast it's quite

2742.56 --> 2751.62
the opposite we just get very pissed off

2749.46 --> 2753.87
when we're being red-herring

2751.62 --> 2757.17
all the time which is like a standard

2753.87 --> 2758.7
procedure for most of the ballers for

2757.17 --> 2760.59
not responding to the question not

2758.7 --> 2765.6
giving recognition to the point we're

2760.59 --> 2771.2400000000002
trying to highlight and flat-earthers in

2765.6 --> 2774.0
general if they really fine-tune system

2771.24 --> 2775.47
to analyze all that in a discussion they

2774.0 --> 2777.24
will just point it out and they will

2775.47 --> 2778.62
become pissed off when there's just no

2777.24 --> 2780.75
response to it and there being red

2778.62 --> 2784.44
herring then at harmed and all that

2780.75 --> 2792.66
that's what happens not the other way

2784.44 --> 2796.53
around we don't start just scoffing at

2792.66 --> 2798.5699999999997
ballers in their presence you know we do

2796.53 --> 2802.6800000000003
kind of make a little bit giggly fun we

2798.57 --> 2804.54
do analyze ballers and their behavior we

2802.68 --> 2807.8399999999997
try to analyze this and to be fair

2804.54 --> 2810.39
ballers do this as well and not always

2807.84 --> 2812.9700000000003
just to be totally evil they do

2810.39 --> 2815.79
genuinely try to figure out what's going

2812.97 --> 2818.8199999999997
on what the processes are sometimes but

2815.79 --> 2820.44
most of the times it just they crash and

2818.82 --> 2822.56
they just don't get it anymore and

2820.44 --> 2825.09
they're just gonna say that just stupid

2822.56 --> 2827.46
that's what ballers do most of the time

2825.09 --> 2833.28
and they then some of them even continue

2827.46 --> 2835.59
on just it jacking off to how [ __ ]

2833.28 --> 2837.75
is and outs also stupid and they're

2835.59 --> 2839.7000000000003
gonna lead to some kind of mental

2837.75 --> 2840.09
institution in their view and blah blah

2839.7 --> 2843.0
blah

2840.09 --> 2846.2400000000002
just this disgusting negative spiral

2843.0 --> 2849.6
that they project on us it's nothing to

2846.24 --> 2852.27
do with what's really going on over the

2849.6 --> 2855.45
years it's proven not to go in that

2852.27 --> 2857.7
direction at all like the worst we deal

2855.45 --> 2861.72
with as flat earthers and as our group

2857.7 --> 2863.8199999999997
is mostly the freakin infighting that's

2861.72 --> 2867.1499999999996
our biggest problem really

2863.82 --> 2870.1400000000003
not our mental health in general at all

2867.15 --> 2873.36
the mental health problems if any

2870.14 --> 2875.73
usually arrive in the first period when

2873.36 --> 2877.65
you really figure out Flat Earth that's

2875.73 --> 2880.86
when the sleepless nights begin that's

2877.65 --> 2885.6600000000003
when you get really confused and maybe

2880.86 --> 2888.36
get carried away with things that type

2885.66 --> 2893.7
of situation and that lasts usually just

2888.36 --> 2898.05
a few months to maybe three and then

2893.7 --> 2902.7799999999997
they basically recrystallize in the new

2898.05 --> 2905.3700000000003
format and find a new balance in that so

2902.78 --> 2909.27
yeah it's not persistent it's never

2905.37 --> 2911.7599999999998
never the way that ballers project when

2909.27 --> 2914.04
they speculate about what's going to

2911.76 --> 2918.63
happen with flat-earthers they never get

2914.04 --> 2930.75
it right they're just fantasizing about

2918.63 --> 2933.57
it and I admit flat earthers including

2930.75 --> 2937.95
myself also do fantasize and at this

2933.57 --> 2941.46
point it is is fantasy whatever happens

2937.95 --> 2943.1099999999997
it's still a fantasy that some time flat

2941.46 --> 2944.9700000000003
earth will be declassified and made

2943.11 --> 2949.1400000000003
official and what will the ballers do

2944.97 --> 2951.33
then yeah that's a fantasy there's no

2949.14 --> 2956.5099999999998
guarantee that that will absolutely

2951.33 --> 2959.79
happen but it's a what-if scenario and

2956.51 --> 2962.4900000000002
toddlers don't get into that type of

2959.79 --> 2964.38
what-if scenario or maybe at most like

2962.49 --> 2966.45
oh if they keep this up all the

2964.38 --> 2967.65
government will eventually arrest them

2966.45 --> 2970.8599999999997
or something like that they may

2967.65 --> 2975.1800000000003
fantasize something like that and who

2970.86 --> 2979.86
knows you know if politics gets nasty

2975.18 --> 2982.6499999999996
enough censoring in a very terrible way

2979.86 --> 2986.9100000000003
yeah that might eventually happen to

2982.65 --> 2988.46
some of us if we just don't adapt it

2986.91 --> 2992.19
could happen

2988.46 --> 2994.619
still it's a fantasy at this point

2992.19 --> 3004.069
and you don't get us right you don't

2994.619 --> 3007.03
understand this because you don't listen

3004.069 --> 3009.2
you know listen to the actual arguments

3007.03 --> 3013.2200000000003
specialized in red herring and just

3009.2 --> 3015.5589999999997
maintaining the oversight in your

3013.22 --> 3017.089
calculus works that's your main focus

3015.559 --> 3019.76
that's what you keep staring at and

3017.089 --> 3023.299
trying to get to that point where you

3019.76 --> 3028.42
can then work on that and you don't

3023.299 --> 3028.42
respond to actual critical arguments

3029.41 --> 3036.2599999999998
that's what most ballers do by far the

3033.95 --> 3038.21
vast majority the ones that are not just

3036.26 --> 3040.01
honestly trying to figure out what's

3038.21 --> 3041.859
going on because there are some ballers

3040.01 --> 3045.92
out there that do that as well

3041.859 --> 3048.17
not a lot they usually are more of the

3045.92 --> 3050.329
on defense types that stay a bit in the

3048.17 --> 3053.359
background but most ballers that are out

3050.329 --> 3059.5890000000004
in the open ballers never they're not

3053.359 --> 3064.27
open-minded at all please Daniel

3059.589 --> 3064.27
don't make me time you out please

3066.01 --> 3071.0890000000004
don't be a freaking keyboard warrior if

3068.9 --> 3073.01
you really think Nathan doesn't

3071.089 --> 3079.43
understand what he's talking about

3073.01 --> 3082.13
I think ya go in a conversation with him

3079.43 --> 3085.0389999999998
actually contact him get a dialogue

3082.13 --> 3087.529
going like you did with me and get on

3085.039 --> 3090.4300000000003
the show you got to do it do it voice

3087.529 --> 3090.43
only whatever

3092.5 --> 3100.03
yeah he does understand what entropy is

3095.69 --> 3103.13
and so do i that way when we talk about

3100.03 --> 3106.4300000000003
the second law of thermodynamics we're

3103.13 --> 3108.77
not talking about the colloquial more

3106.43 --> 3112.73
philosophical based form of entropy that

3108.77 --> 3116.03
spans over all time philosophical

3112.73 --> 3119.27
realizations about that effect it's just

3116.03 --> 3126.05
the plain physics element of entropy

3119.27 --> 3130.5099999999998
that's really what we focus on and we do

3126.05 --> 3130.51
understand that we absolutely do

3136.85 --> 3145.71
me rational helium balloons doesn't

3139.98 --> 3149.16
prove nor disprove gravity anything can

3145.71 --> 3152.25
prove or disprove gravity except for the

3149.16 --> 3154.5899999999997
scientific method which can't be used to

3152.25 --> 3159.45
prove gravity and therefore gravity is

3154.59 --> 3162.1800000000003
not scientific thus not proven and yeah

3159.45 --> 3164.43
that system is really nice it if you

3162.18 --> 3166.2599999999998
apply it it will work out the figures

3164.43 --> 3168.0899999999997
will work out that's just great

3166.26 --> 3170.4300000000003
you know just like the curvature

3168.09 --> 3171.9300000000003
calculate it works out yeah I misses the

3170.43 --> 3179.19
viewing function but it works out of the

3171.93 --> 3182.18
look it's just like no curvature

3179.19 --> 3186.2000000000003
calculator misses viewing function

3182.18 --> 3191.5499999999997
gravity misses scientific evidence

3186.2 --> 3193.5
scientific proof sorry it's just yeah

3191.55 --> 3195.84
it's really nice you can use things

3193.5 --> 3198.24
compare things deduce things that's

3195.84 --> 3202.94
really nice I can do it too I do it a

3198.24 --> 3206.25
lot in my speculations in my

3202.94 --> 3208.26
conceptualizations of what could be it's

3206.25 --> 3210.69
very useful to think about these things

3208.26 --> 3215.82
as you try to figure out how the world

3210.69 --> 3221.3
works try to lay a scout ahead the

3215.82 --> 3225.81
possibilities but yeah you can't really

3221.3 --> 3227.9700000000003
put any weight on any of the conclusions

3225.81 --> 3233.69
drawn in these processes because they

3227.97 --> 3233.6899999999996
are speculative they're not scientific

3239.94 --> 3249.569
oh please Daniel please please don't

3246.569 --> 3251.46
make me kick you out you've been asking

3249.569 --> 3254.94
so many interesting questions if you're

3251.46 --> 3258.329
gonna do this [ __ ] I can't tolerate that

3254.94 --> 3261.089
yeah you can't make that kind of

3258.329 --> 3263.039
ridiculous statement just ask your

3261.089 --> 3266.94
question do what you're good at

3263.039 --> 3271.289
don't judge people because you suck you

3266.94 --> 3273.599
suck at it you suck at sizing of

3271.289 --> 3276.78
people's knowledge Daniel just don't do

3273.599 --> 3279.809
it just ask your questions just just do

3276.78 --> 3283.039
your material don't judge other people

3279.809 --> 3283.039
you're terrible at it

3302.5 --> 3315.22
right fyodor dostoyevsky thank you thank

3311.99 --> 3317.5989999999997
you for apparently understanding

3315.22 --> 3322.7599999999998
complexities that I do deal with it is

3317.599 --> 3325.369
very complex it falls into the same

3322.76 --> 3326.96
category as the subject that my premier

3325.369 --> 3330.02
started out with yesterday and that is

3326.96 --> 3334.82
with sites there's just different layers

3330.02 --> 3338.63
you have the actual observation or the

3334.82 --> 3342.7400000000002
sensory organs like the eye you have

3338.63 --> 3345.32
your conscious which is the part you're

3342.74 --> 3350.8999999999996
you experience but there is a mechanism

3345.32 --> 3355.82
in between that an editor that pre edits

3350.9 --> 3358.07
the input to give it a context for the

3355.82 --> 3360.619
conscious so you don't have to actually

3358.07 --> 3363.5
stare and think about what you're seeing

3360.619 --> 3366.8900000000003
every time you look at something but

3363.5 --> 3370.94
that mechanism pre draws conclusions as

3366.89 --> 3372.68
well so it can mislead you in with

3370.94 --> 3375.13
certain type of setups can be fooled

3372.68 --> 3380.66
that mechanism like with colors and

3375.13 --> 3386.2400000000002
shapes parent shapes all that and yeah

3380.66 --> 3391.66
the same goes for science apparent

3386.24 --> 3395.81
forces yeah apparent heavenly bodies

3391.66 --> 3401.359
apparitions aberrations all these things

3395.81 --> 3403.79
and mathematical structures in the

3401.359 --> 3405.65
backdrop these things all go parallel

3403.79 --> 3409.46
they have their own function their ways

3405.65 --> 3411.05
the way it compares but just because

3409.46 --> 3415.07
there is a structure out there that

3411.05 --> 3418.01
works that's not sufficient proof you

3415.07 --> 3421.76
have to tie it down and the way you do

3418.01 --> 3424.13
that is through either as far as you can

3421.76 --> 3427.25
go empirical deduction with certain

3424.13 --> 3429.17
elements that doesn't have the full way

3427.25 --> 3431.18
that doesn't have to full tie down these

3429.17 --> 3433.54
deep complete earthing

3431.18 --> 3439.1
which can only be achieved when a

3433.54 --> 3442.09
scientific method is applied and that's

3439.1 --> 3442.0899999999997
just how it works

3445.64 --> 3452.9
that's that's how you categorize what is

3450.089 --> 3452.9
real and what is not

3464.289 --> 3472.13
right Daniel well he will be repeating

3468.589 --> 3472.519
that that statement for a long time to

3472.13 --> 3478.069
come

3472.519 --> 3485.7189999999996
because it's absolutely correct it is

3478.069 --> 3489.859
true and unless you want to prove that

3485.719 --> 3493.009
it's not true which well since it is a

3489.859 --> 3495.5589999999997
law I don't think anyone has ever

3493.009 --> 3498.829
succeeded that's basically what yeah

3495.559 --> 3501.7690000000002
what the law of it the law part implies

3498.829 --> 3505.1600000000003
so I wish you good luck proving that and

3501.769 --> 3508.8799999999997
don't use your fictional example out of

3505.16 --> 3512.3289999999997
rich example of the earth itself because

3508.88 --> 3514.609
you can't actually confirm any of those

3512.329 --> 3518.569
speculations about how that's supposed

3514.609 --> 3522.229
to function and yeah the gradient

3518.569 --> 3526.0589999999997
doesn't prove that just depress your

3522.229 --> 3528.739
lessons or that gravity this theorized

3526.059 --> 3531.9990000000003
force this equilibrium constants

3528.739 --> 3537.069
whatever the cause may be presumed to be

3531.999 --> 3540.229
yet that doesn't work because it

3537.069 --> 3542.599
completely ignores the need for gas

3540.229 --> 3545.479
pressure to expand within the available

3542.599 --> 3549.9100000000003
container to find an equilibrium which

3545.479 --> 3554.209
is a standard prerequisite situation

3549.91 --> 3557.989
okay in order for a gradient of any type

3554.209 --> 3560.4489999999996
to form first the gas pressure needs to

3557.989 --> 3564.979
find an equilibrium because until it

3560.449 --> 3566.779
does things will be turbulent forces

3564.979 --> 3570.41
will be exerted all over the place

3566.779 --> 3575.089
because of the rapid power of gas

3570.41 --> 3576.709
pressure expansion and only after that

3575.089 --> 3579.229
has stopped that process has been

3576.709 --> 3583.0989999999997
fulfilled which will be very quickly in

3579.229 --> 3585.709
the available container only then will

3583.099 --> 3590.599
the gas pressure find an equilibrium and

3585.709 --> 3592.459
then yeah whatever is at work in the

3590.599 --> 3594.529
within the confines of the container

3592.459 --> 3596.3489999999997
whatever forces are applied or apparent

3594.529 --> 3599.079
forces or workings

3596.349 --> 3600.7290000000003
relative density only after the gas

3599.079 --> 3603.7000000000003
pressure equilibrium within the

3600.729 --> 3606.16
container is found only then can some

3603.7 --> 3608.589
kind of gradient the relative density

3606.16 --> 3613.17
gradient a gas pressure gradient then

3608.589 --> 3615.729
only will these things start to form

3613.17 --> 3617.9700000000003
start to occur and this can be

3615.729 --> 3617.97
demonstrated

3628.04 --> 3631.45
Oh God

3639.869 --> 3646.6800000000003
right Daniel that's correct

3643.17 --> 3650.23
gas particles fall down in a vacuum

3646.68 --> 3653.25
because yeah the relative density of the

3650.23 --> 3659.5
gas particles is greater than the vacuum

3653.25 --> 3663.339
and eventually when there's enough gas

3659.5 --> 3665.38
particles they will spread out within

3663.339 --> 3669.04
the container whether it be mostly

3665.38 --> 3671.94
vacuum or not for as far as they can

3669.04 --> 3675.16
expand themselves within that container

3671.94 --> 3677.02
then there will be very thin air spread

3675.16 --> 3680.68
out throughout that container and there

3677.02 --> 3682.0
may even be some kind of minut gradient

3680.68 --> 3686.43
once

3682.0 --> 3686.43
yeah there's no more gas being added so

3687.059 --> 3698.65
yeah that doesn't prove anything about

3690.79 --> 3701.46
gravity but nice try

3698.65 --> 3701.46
nice try

3703.3 --> 3706.559
[Music]

3712.51 --> 3718.7200000000003
[Music]

3715.58 --> 3721.66
all right

3718.72 --> 3724.54
all right yeah Daniel that's that's

3721.66 --> 3727.54
really cool atmospheric pressure is

3724.54 --> 3731.44
indeed the weight of the air that that's

3727.54 --> 3734.05
right the weight or yeah the pressure

3731.44 --> 3738.03
that exists on that relative density

3734.05 --> 3738.03
level that's correct

3741.049 --> 3747.349
but yeah none of it would even be there

3743.449 --> 3750.109
if there was yeah if there were if the

3747.349 --> 3755.239
system of Earth was open it would all

3750.109 --> 3757.699
just blow out you know gravity can push

3755.239 --> 3762.349
the presumed gravity can push back

3757.699 --> 3767.149
slightly it's not even nearly not even

3762.349 --> 3771.829
close enough to exert any level of force

3767.149 --> 3774.609
sufficient to stop the rapid gas

3771.829 --> 3781.759
pressure expansion that will occur if

3774.609 --> 3783.919
there is no container or rather if the

3781.759 --> 3787.399
container is not already filled which it

3783.919 --> 3789.709
is because that is an antecedent for gas

3787.399 --> 3793.1189999999997
pressure to exist in the first place and

3789.709 --> 3793.1189999999997
there is gas pressure here

3801.08 --> 3807.89
yeah you take some time to think about

3804.09 --> 3810.26
that Daniel take it to him

3807.89 --> 3814.22
yeah I'm gonna round out the show

3810.26 --> 3814.2200000000003
shortly so

3815.44 --> 3818.639
[Music]

3826.95 --> 3829.7599999999998
yeah

3838.23 --> 3842.59
well chocolates saying I don't think

3840.52 --> 3848.95
Daniel wants to actually come on my

3842.59 --> 3855.46
panel just yet we discussed it in a

3848.95 --> 3860.3799999999997
comment section some time ago but he may

3855.46 --> 3863.4
might eventually but Gardens like this I

3860.38 --> 3863.4
don't think so

3870.94 --> 3873.569
right

3876.49 --> 3885.0989999999997
Daniel it is an argument it's a law of

3881.01 --> 3887.17
physics and just because physics has

3885.099 --> 3889.69
been expanded upon and modernized

3887.17 --> 3893.8
doesn't mean that the second law of

3889.69 --> 3899.17
thermodynamics has been disproven which

3893.8 --> 3902.38
requires scientific evidence so unless

3899.17 --> 3905.08
you have scientific evidence with an

3902.38 --> 3907.63
independent variable and all that to

3905.08 --> 3908.7999999999997
prove that the second law of

3907.63 --> 3911.77
thermodynamics

3908.8 --> 3915.4
no longer works out that it's not a law

3911.77 --> 3917.74
anymore that that can be discarded then

3915.4 --> 3921.13
it remains a law so I wish you the best

3917.74 --> 3924.04
of luck in scientifically proving that

3921.13 --> 3932.2000000000003
the second law of thermodynamics does

3924.04 --> 3935.2
not work good luck yeah I do that's

3932.2 --> 3937.5299999999997
exactly what you said it's exactly what

3935.2 --> 3937.5299999999997
you said

3946.67 --> 3954.23
you can't say all modern physics all

3951.079 --> 3957.17
that old stuff we don't need no that old

3954.23 --> 3960.92
stuff is real it works it has never been

3957.17 --> 3963.98
disclaimed by modern physics okay it's

3960.92 --> 3969.14
just being ignored like you bunch are

3963.98 --> 3971.18
ignoring it perpetually and complainer

3969.14 --> 3973.46
is just repeating the same thing over

3971.18 --> 3977.269
and over again yeah because it's real

3973.46 --> 3985.5190000000002
and you're ignoring it you're not

3977.269 --> 3989.14
responding you're just ignoring it yeah

3985.519 --> 3989.14
time for you to go [ __ ]

4008.01 --> 4018.03
that sentence doesn't make any damn

4010.2 --> 4021.3289999999997
sense Daniel what with all that nonsense

4018.03 --> 4023.13
your atmospheric pressure blah blah blah

4021.329 --> 4027.27
no it's not about that it's about gas

4023.13 --> 4030.15
pressure gas pressure in order for gas

4027.27 --> 4033.119
pressure to exist there must be a

4030.15 --> 4038.4
container that's the thing

4033.119 --> 4041.339
stop freaking straw Manning the argument

4038.4 --> 4046.23
with your shitty other ways to approach

4041.339 --> 4052.339
it new scientism theorizing [ __ ] gas

4046.23 --> 4055.5
pressure requires a container that's it

4052.339 --> 4057.75
don't tell me to Google things Daniel

4055.5 --> 4061.109
I'm getting sick of this I'm getting

4057.75 --> 4064.349
seriously sick of this I'm yeah I'm

4061.109 --> 4066.63
timing you out now and if you're gonna

4064.349 --> 4069.2400000000002
do this again I'm banning you because

4066.63 --> 4072.78
this is not what I want to see from you

4069.24 --> 4080.1189999999997
this is not why I've been tolerating you

4072.78 --> 4080.119
in my chat okay so you know

4088.01 --> 4091.8590000000004
[Music]

4104.579 --> 4112.0199999999995
so enough of that yeah atmospheric

4108.54 --> 4117.059
pressure it's chemistry correct pressure

4112.02 --> 4122.279
still it's gas pressure yeah

4117.059 --> 4125.719
why is a container atmospheric pressure

4122.279 --> 4130.799000000001
it's just sidestepped it's another angle

4125.719 --> 4134.309
to a geological presume tip situation

4130.799 --> 4145.44
that's what it is it's still gas

4134.309 --> 4147.809
pressure I think there's a whole lot of

4145.44 --> 4149.79
people here that are really looking

4147.809 --> 4154.429
forward for me to timing them out

4149.79 --> 4160.139
because they keep on just talking [ __ ]

4154.429 --> 4162.529
and that's fine by me I'll stay I'll

4160.139 --> 4165.599
stay a little on a little longer just

4162.529 --> 4169.549000000001
time people out that's fine and ban them

4165.599 --> 4169.549
if they go too far so go ahead

4181.93 --> 4185.039000000001
[Music]

4196.35 --> 4199.4890000000005
[Music]

4201.329 --> 4204.32
anyone else

4213.41 --> 4219.5
that's fine Swansea yeah you don't have

4216.57 --> 4219.5
to agree with me

4219.89 --> 4225.71
just support my super chat and I fought

4223.05 --> 4230.99
the video that's all great totally fine

4225.71 --> 4234.54
just don't get repetitive and don't just

4230.99 --> 4236.7
red herring or keep on saying the same

4234.54 --> 4242.36
nonsense like this doesn't really judge

4236.7 --> 4244.98
it again get out the arguments or just

4242.36 --> 4245.58
whatever you know make a joke that's

4244.98 --> 4248.669999999999
fine

4245.58 --> 4254.88
like that little comment comedic

4248.67 --> 4257.58
creativity no problem at all yeah yeah

4254.88 --> 4260.76
mercury m7 that's really good question

4257.58 --> 4262.53
yeah atmospheric pressure oh this is so

4260.76 --> 4265.77
different no layers yeah it's gas

4262.53 --> 4268.62
fresher it's gas fresher it's all gas

4265.77 --> 4270.4800000000005
pressure and gas pressure here is a

4268.62 --> 4273.24
container so it's really nice that all

4270.48 --> 4277.65
that the grade in all the layers right

4273.24 --> 4280.95
yeah its gas pressure okay or do you

4277.65 --> 4283.379999999999
deny that it is gas pressure if you deny

4280.95 --> 4288.5599999999995
it is gas pressure then please by all

4283.38 --> 4288.56
means tell us I think it is

4291.37 --> 4294.55
[Music]

4301.329 --> 4304.42
all right Graeme Brown it's a good

4303.559 --> 4306.860000000001
question

4304.42 --> 4308.75
we don't know there's a lot of

4306.86 --> 4312.65
speculation about it what we do know

4308.75 --> 4316.01
however is that there must be a

4312.65 --> 4325.69
container or there would be no gas

4316.01 --> 4328.52
pressure so however that container is

4325.69 --> 4332.739
functioning it is functioning because

4328.52 --> 4337.400000000001
otherwise we'd have no gas pressure or

4332.739 --> 4340.78
well simply the amount of space

4337.4 --> 4345.0199999999995
available within this realm is limited

4340.78 --> 4348.11
by for example a looping factor as I

4345.02 --> 4352.46
have conceptualized as I have theorized

4348.11 --> 4356.409
about but yeah an container must be

4352.46 --> 4359.09
there in one form or another

4356.409 --> 4360.739
otherwise there cannot be gas pressure

4359.09 --> 4363.4890000000005
and there cannot be a gradient there

4360.739 --> 4363.489
wouldn't be anything

daniel's doing it still swimming in his

4430.979 --> 4438.059
model calculus based fantasy still just

4435.449 --> 4440.07
wandering around the oversight of how

4438.059 --> 4442.26
that atmospheric pressure is ignoring

4440.07 --> 4446.34
everything else just only that thing

4442.26 --> 4450.030000000001
that suggests in his mind that there

4446.34 --> 4453.019
must be an open system somehow just did

4450.03 --> 4453.018999999999
you do it you just

4465.239 --> 4478.0199999999995

4623.1 --> 4629.280000000001
then they listen to another level of

4626.75 --> 4633.03
reasoning things out and having yeah

4629.28 --> 4637.05
societal wide overview and criticism on

4633.03 --> 4639.75
technical parts of society and then they

4637.05 --> 4642.0

4642.0 --> 4647.01
of reasonable and interesting some

4644.79 --> 4650.73

days during this hour but if I go on a

4714.179 --> 4719.369
little bit later then yeah usually

4716.189 --> 4722.129
people start throwing around cash in the

4719.369 --> 4725.639
super chat so but oh well you know every

4722.129 --> 4727.379
day I have a show and yeah any little

4725.639 --> 4728.909000000001
bit helps I do get some time so I

4727.379 --> 4732.599
shouldn't be complaining about it too

4728.909 --> 4735.03
much but any other means of financial

4732.599 --> 4741.809
support are also very much appreciated

4735.03 --> 4745.139
and alright anything else yeah share the

4741.809 --> 4746.849
show of course always and I'm really

4745.139 --> 4748.679
trying to build up this new routine of

4746.849 --> 4750.629
starting out plugging and everything at

4748.679 --> 4757.889
the start because should be doing that

4750.629 --> 4759.57
it's kind of how do you say that it

4757.889 --> 4761.639
feels weird to me because I'm not used

4759.57 --> 4764.518999999999
to doing that like never done it like

4761.639 --> 4766.769
that but I I will have to I feel I have

4764.519 --> 4768.869000000001
to especially to remind everyone to

4766.769 --> 4772.289000000001
share the show up front because it's

4768.869 --> 4774.78
much more useful than afterward so but

4772.289 --> 4777.03
yeah I'm pretty satisfied I'm gonna move

4774.78 --> 4781.289
the show forward improve my performance

4777.03 --> 4783.389
overall also try to get rid of most of

4781.289 --> 4785.129
the silent pauses when I'm looking at

4783.389 --> 4787.619
chap get through it more quickly there's

4785.129 --> 4789.419
a lot of criticism I have on the quality

4787.619 --> 4792.478999999999
as a show host I have to improve that

4789.419 --> 4794.579
and I will keep on doing that but yeah

4792.479 --> 4798.059
some kind of financial incentive will

4794.579 --> 4801.478999999999
absolutely motivate me measurably you

4798.059 --> 4803.939
will see the effects of it immediately

4801.479 --> 4806.309
as you have every time I do get some

4803.939 --> 4810.479
kind of donation makes me very confident

4806.309 --> 4813.469
in the future of the show so anyway

4810.479 --> 4815.829000000001
enough about that money-grubbing

4813.469 --> 4819.169
I'd barely get anything out of it anyway

4815.829 --> 4822.549999999999
except like that first bit that was good

4819.169 --> 4827.059
but yeah just have to see when the next

4822.55 --> 4831.38
financial donation from YouTube is gonna

4827.059 --> 4833.389
arrive anyway yeah I will be back

4831.38 --> 4839.709
tomorrow with flat earth early-bird

4833.389 --> 4843.88
number 155 and yeah until the next show

4839.709 --> 4843.88
keep it flat

4846.45 --> 4877.739
