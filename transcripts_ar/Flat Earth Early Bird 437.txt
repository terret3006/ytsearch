michael roark yes v-power 1 1 7 yeah

192.52 --> 196.989
good to see you all

193.72 --> 199.54
I'm very early so yeah don't expect

196.989 --> 203.86
everyone to be here right away on a

199.54 --> 207.76
Sunday morning but I'm starting a bit

203.86 --> 217.0
early because well I was kind of sick of

207.76 --> 219.60999999999999
waiting wait it's re got distracted but

217.0 --> 223.93
yeah I'm gonna have a D&D game after a

219.61 --> 231.489
long time it's been almost two months

223.93 --> 234.519
and yeah I suddenly got into it like

231.489 --> 236.739
this morning I thought like oh damn I I

234.519 --> 239.26
was I've almost forgot like this

236.739 --> 243.22
situation I still kind of have to handle

239.26 --> 246.57899999999998
as to how the story will unfold like I

243.22 --> 248.47
have to do the the cutscene situation

246.579 --> 251.65
properly in a way that is convinced

248.47 --> 254.41
about you know you can't cutscene you're

251.65 --> 256.18
way too much like if certain things

254.41 --> 257.709
transpire that could technically be

256.18 --> 259.72
prevented that kind of thing then

257.709 --> 261.1
they're gonna complain so it's it's

259.72 --> 265.15000000000003
something I have to work out very

261.1 --> 267.04
carefully and then I realized oh damn

265.15 --> 269.28999999999996
it's there's more characters I kind of

267.04 --> 272.38
need to make and

269.29 --> 275.70000000000005
so because I kind of put it to the side

272.38 --> 279.19
they've been I just it takes up a lot of

275.7 --> 282.03999999999996
space every time I deal with that and

279.19 --> 284.59
I've been so focused on the flatter

282.04 --> 289.27000000000004
scene in the situation concerning the

284.59 --> 293.84999999999997
the lights the wave-particle situation

289.27 --> 293.84999999999997
that I just completely forgot about it

294.24 --> 307.57
and it's gonna start at 5 p.m. and I

299.32 --> 310.99
yeah I have to take yeah I need at least

307.57 --> 313.36
two hours preparation time at least it's

310.99 --> 317.89
probably not gonna be enough but it'll

313.36 --> 321.13
have to do and also because of the food

317.89 --> 323.26
arrangements because I have to be there

321.13 --> 327.28
at 5:00 then I can't have normal dinner

323.26 --> 329.17
and I don't think necessarily that yeah

327.28 --> 331.39
and one of the guys is gonna buy me

329.17 --> 333.58000000000004
dinner there because they do serve

331.39 --> 335.71
organic food at this new place we're

333.58 --> 337.15
gonna try out to play the game because

335.71 --> 340.06
we have trouble finding a playing

337.15 --> 343.21
location because the room downstairs is

340.06 --> 345.88
not working the apartment from one of

343.21 --> 351.33
the players apparently it's not an

345.88 --> 351.33
option anymore now I think I'm not sure

352.62 --> 359.92
but yeah so it's a bit of a hassle today

357.49 --> 362.65000000000003
for me therefore I'm not gonna have a

359.92 --> 367.21000000000004
two-hour show as I would typically so

362.65 --> 372.21
sorry for everyone hey hello Madame ikan

367.21 --> 372.21
yeah it's a very early early bird indeed

372.27 --> 379.87
so did anyone catch the the debate the

377.89 --> 382.69
Flat Earth debate situation from Friday

379.87 --> 385.12
I'm not even sure if it has streamed yet

382.69 --> 388.99
I'm seriously not certain or what

385.12 --> 393.31
happened I just

388.99 --> 395.53000000000003
I I've been feeling like I've been I

393.31 --> 401.169
need to take my distance because the

395.53 --> 404.02
whole situation kind of shocked me so

401.169 --> 413.37
I'm not as active as I used to be but

404.02 --> 417.33
that's just temporary so what's what am

413.37 --> 417.33
not you to come on

426.69 --> 430.35
can be serious

441.51 --> 446.7
look for starters that whole Friday

444.63 --> 453.17
situation I didn't even really start it

446.7 --> 457.62
okay but yeah when a point is made then

453.17 --> 461.07
and it's a good point I can't just shut

457.62 --> 463.52
up to go along to get along but at least

461.07 --> 467.01
have to give some recognition to it and

463.52 --> 471.93
if I'm then instantly attacked for

467.01 --> 474.62
holding to my principles yeah you know I

471.93 --> 477.66
have to be in a very good mood

474.62 --> 480.74
very stable mood in order to then just

477.66 --> 480.74
step away immediately

506.92 --> 511.75
that what do you mean Adam just loved

510.13 --> 514.29
when you bothered to look into the

511.75 --> 514.29
subject

532.3 --> 539.26
I personally think it's actually quite

536.43 --> 543.04
serious what's going on concerning the

539.26 --> 544.71
whole duality between the the wave and

543.04 --> 546.91
the particles

544.71 --> 548.58
all right the buckyballs and

546.91 --> 553.39
wavefunction right

548.58 --> 561.13
well Randy found that document yeah the

553.39 --> 563.68
guy did he did find it and weirdly

561.13 --> 566.08
enough I think I've seen it before

563.68 --> 568.9599999999999
like I've glanced at that specific

566.08 --> 571.69
document before somehow I don't know how

568.96 --> 573.7
but yeah the thing that caught my eye

571.69 --> 577.3000000000001
didn't really read it I should probably

573.7 --> 580.51
read it but seems pretty compact and

577.3 --> 585.88
difficult to read through but the what I

580.51 --> 589.38
think was a photo or yeah of the of the

585.88 --> 592.57
patterns didn't exactly show

589.38 --> 597.6
well a diffraction pattern that could be

592.57 --> 597.6
compared to when light does it

603.3 --> 610.4599999999999
so it's like something else what is that

623.94 --> 629.69
all right yeah that one think

635.27 --> 644.1999999999999
right but this is 2012

674.55 --> 681.279
interference pattern okay that's a kind

678.339 --> 686.019
of a big claim in that article because I

681.279 --> 688.389
did see DD what is it the 1990 output

686.019 --> 694.18
this one doesn't even show any pictures

688.389 --> 701.339
at all because I'm pretty sure that

694.18 --> 706.4699999999999
image there it it doesn't even say oh

701.339 --> 711.399
wait they it does say photograph by wood

706.47 --> 714.94
okay so that is really photograph what

711.399 --> 721.329
is it double slit experiment of what

714.94 --> 723.2790000000001
light not very specific anyway yeah

721.329 --> 726.3389999999999
thanks for the link I've seen it before

723.279 --> 729.61
it was the I think this is what Jonah

726.339 --> 731.0400000000001
rich in the forwarded to looked at but

729.61 --> 735.1
it's just a story

731.04 --> 739.23
it doesn't really contain the the rod

735.1 --> 739.23
the more raw data as well

746.47 --> 753.35
of course you can get a picture again it

750.319 --> 757.2199999999999
doesn't have to be a literal photograph

753.35 --> 759.23
of the plates used well I don't know

757.22 --> 761.87
some kind of camera recording in order

759.23 --> 765.879
to establish the set up would be nice as

761.87 --> 768.86
extra backdrop information to see but

765.879 --> 772.939
just yeah how how was the data

768.86 --> 774.74
registered well if that is all

772.939 --> 781.389
electronic then at least did their

774.74 --> 781.389
electronic readout of of the surface

787.79 --> 792.89
it explains what is occurring well I'm

790.55 --> 795.92
not necessarily interested at this point

792.89 --> 797.5699999999999
in to an explanation as to what is

795.92 --> 802.2099999999999
occurring I just want to see the raw

797.57 --> 802.21
data because I have a lot of doubts
