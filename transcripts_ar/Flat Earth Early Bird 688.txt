86.64 --> 89.6
and this afternoon

90.0 --> 95.119
and it it kind of kept gr dry yesterday

93.119 --> 98.159
as well

95.119 --> 98.159
after the afternoon

98.4 --> 102.96000000000001
just kind of nice because i was watching

101.28 --> 105.2
my bed sheets and all that

102.96 --> 107.03999999999999
and that way they could have a chance to

105.2 --> 110.72
dry

107.04 --> 115.84
uh but yeah quite beautiful

110.72 --> 115.84
would you not say

116.159 --> 121.84
all right and over there they're i don't

118.96 --> 125.03999999999999
know they're doing some logging work

121.84 --> 127.60000000000001
so they're trimming the forest

125.04 --> 129.28
i think a little bit further back i'm

127.6 --> 131.35999999999999
gonna have to check out what they did

129.28 --> 132.16
exactly because i couldn't see it from

131.36 --> 135.44000000000003
here

132.16 --> 135.44
or even from the roof

137.76 --> 145.35999999999999
but they're vlogging something anyway

142.16 --> 145.35999999999999
let's see who's in chat

146.72 --> 149.84
all right tom parker was first good

149.2 --> 154.0
servant

149.84 --> 157.84
rob h good to see you so far

154.0 --> 157.84
right it's monday

164.72 --> 171.84
let's get my notes

173.76 --> 176.319
right

179.12 --> 185.84
let me update my notes

188.159 --> 199.84
for myself because i

191.68 --> 199.84
did a little bit more than that uh

208.4 --> 217.36
right ah patricia duckery is here

212.959 --> 227.04
obermuco yeah good to see you too

217.36 --> 230.239
the random explorer

227.04 --> 233.439
yeah yeah i watched um

230.239 --> 235.59900000000002
see yeah that was the uh the premiere of

233.439 --> 239.28
course fvd premiere

235.599 --> 243.35999999999999
much expected from friday

239.28 --> 246.56
and yeah that was funny like ed was just

243.36 --> 247.43900000000002
completely making luna yeah he was just

246.56 --> 250.72
so

247.439 --> 253.439
out there even for ed

250.72 --> 253.84
well now that's usually what we it's

253.439 --> 256.239
just

253.84 --> 257.12
it baffles me every time he does go that

256.239 --> 259.67999999999995
far

257.12 --> 263.199
also for some reason that was very

259.68 --> 266.56
freaky like at the end of that premiere

263.199 --> 268.88
he started saying things like oh irwin

266.56 --> 273.28000000000003
wants to kill me

268.88 --> 275.68
what i think he was referring to

273.28 --> 278.08
like that time when i said that i want

275.68 --> 281.199
to kill trolls i don't plan to

278.08 --> 283.03999999999996
i don't like wanting it but

281.199 --> 285.28000000000003
yeah that's just an experience that i

283.04 --> 288.72
have and i'm not trying to

285.28 --> 291.59999999999997
just not give in to it

288.72 --> 292.88000000000005
nah it's not that bad but it can get

291.6 --> 297.12
pretty bad at times

292.88 --> 299.919
it's not at this time

297.12 --> 301.52
sometimes just i can't handle trolls as

299.919 --> 301.919
well and then i get a little like that

301.52 --> 304.96
but

301.919 --> 306.71999999999997
yeah it's not that time and i

304.96 --> 308.88
i guess that ed thought it was worth it

306.72 --> 312.8
to

308.88 --> 312.8
try and distract everyone with that

312.88 --> 316.96
to distract from him just being

315.039 --> 321.039
annihilated

316.96 --> 322.56
psychologically argumentatively

321.039 --> 324.56
because it was pretty pathetic the

322.56 --> 327.919
friday show from outside

324.56 --> 328.8
like really bad and i guess he doesn't

327.919 --> 331.19899999999996
like that

328.8 --> 331.91900000000004
even though yeah he could do something

331.199 --> 335.44
about it

331.919 --> 339.44
you know but he doesn't seem to be

335.44 --> 341.759
planning to anytime soon anyway

339.44 --> 341.759
right

344.32 --> 349.67
also i made that remark

347.36 --> 350.88
it's like a joke remark

349.67 --> 352.96000000000004
[Music]

350.88 --> 354.88
like collapsing the knowing which

352.96 --> 358.96
reference frame

354.88 --> 358.96
coriolis deviation path

361.84 --> 367.28
anyway it's even when i read it out it

365.919 --> 370.4
is already confusing

367.28 --> 373.44
it's supposed to be it's a mix

370.4 --> 373.44
of two concepts

373.6 --> 380.88
anyway um

377.28 --> 384.55999999999995
right other than that just being

380.88 --> 386.08
gaming and watching continue watching

384.56 --> 388.4
the worst witch

386.08 --> 389.59999999999997
it's it's which makes me feel weird just

388.4 --> 393.039
saying that because it

389.6 --> 396.88
it's definitely a series for kids

393.039 --> 397.52
but it's just interesting to me to see

396.88 --> 401.199
like

397.52 --> 403.59999999999997
what is this because it's not

401.199 --> 407.28000000000003
exactly harry potter but it does feel

403.6 --> 408.96000000000004
like it in many different ways

407.28 --> 411.039
but also yeah something that i just

408.96 --> 414.31899999999996
noticed it's not so

411.039 --> 416.31899999999996
overkill special effect like

414.319 --> 417.759
the special effects are relatively

416.319 --> 421.44
simple

417.759 --> 424.47900000000004
it's not overly cgi they don't have any

421.44 --> 426.16
3d models of the characters

424.479 --> 427.919
like in harry potter you know where they

426.16 --> 431.759
do that a lot

427.919 --> 435.12
and then just make a cgi fest out of it

431.759 --> 435.12
they don't really do that here

435.52 --> 439.28
anyway yeah

439.759 --> 442.96000000000004
he will have a complete and utter

441.52 --> 447.35999999999996
breakdown well rob h

442.96 --> 449.919
ed is already he's like

447.36 --> 450.96000000000004
in the course of a breakdown he's he is

449.919 --> 454.31899999999996
breaking down

450.96 --> 457.19899999999996
he's just publicly breaking down when

454.319 --> 457.199
when he comes on

459.36 --> 464.56
like he might not give up you know he's

462.8 --> 466.8
not breaking down like that but

464.56 --> 468.0
everything else is pretty much up for

466.8 --> 471.84000000000003
grabs

468.0 --> 475.84
everything else can tumble can topple

471.84 --> 478.4
i mean yeah at phrase we're talking

475.84 --> 480.79999999999995
about add phrase embol

478.4 --> 482.23999999999995
he's yeah he doesn't even make videos

480.8 --> 486.319
he's mostly just a

482.24 --> 486.319
a discord troll figure

488.879 --> 496.56
just like jikey and rumpus

493.28 --> 499.919
he's also known as beavis

496.56 --> 503.12
chicky or no he's he's he's supposed to

499.919 --> 504.96
be butthead because jaiki is beautiful

503.12 --> 507.84000000000003
she picks him up because they're both

504.96 --> 507.84
very stupid

517.839 --> 522.719
anyway yeah

520.88 --> 524.32
no owned benjamin yesterday except for

522.719 --> 527.839
very late

524.32 --> 534.08
i wasn't there i think he did do a

527.839 --> 535.6800000000001
uh a brief stream but didn't catch it

534.08 --> 538.48
oh yeah fred almost forgot there was

535.68 --> 549.8389999999999
also bible literalist also did a stream

538.48 --> 549.839
somewhere and i did catch part of that

555.36 --> 559.519
oh yeah and i said oh there we go yeah

558.399 --> 562.56
brian forrester

559.519 --> 565.68
also did another stream

562.56 --> 569.8389999999999
and this time it was more like a

565.68 --> 572.7199999999999
walking through the ruins type of video

569.839 --> 572.72
i think it was him

574.0 --> 579.2
and i mentioned that i mentioned his

576.959 --> 579.1999999999999
show

580.16 --> 584.399
or is his channel on my streams

588.839 --> 594.0
um

591.36 --> 596.32
america and canada have destroyed the

594.0 --> 604.72
world with stupid cartoon characters

596.32 --> 606.8000000000001
what what do you mean

604.72 --> 608.1600000000001
i don't think beefs and butter is the

606.8 --> 612.8
cause for

608.16 --> 612.8
people's behavior like that

614.48 --> 621.04
he's not trying to be beef is

618.64 --> 622.959
he's just stooping to that level of

621.04 --> 624.959
stupidity and probably on purpose but

622.959 --> 627.5999999999999
he's not trying to aim for being

624.959 --> 629.76
like one of those characters that's very

627.6 --> 631.76
different

629.76 --> 632.8
it's not that hard to act like those

631.76 --> 634.64
characters

632.8 --> 636.64
there's a lot of people that can do that

634.64 --> 637.8389999999999
he's not trying to do that but we call

636.64 --> 641.04
him

637.839 --> 644.5600000000001
after those characters because of just

641.04 --> 644.56
the level of intelligence he is

644.839 --> 650.6400000000001
displaying

647.6 --> 652.64
hey stop the traffic in my rest i had oh

650.64 --> 661.8389999999999
yeah i almost forgot i got green tea too

652.64 --> 661.8389999999999
by the way

677.36 --> 684.0
so yeah monday morning

680.56 --> 684.56
for the united states wonder what kind

684.0 --> 686.839
of weather

684.56 --> 688.4799999999999
it is over there it's really nice over

686.839 --> 703.839
here

688.48 --> 703.839
yeah i'll show it again

704.61 --> 707.669
[Music]

724.0 --> 729.2
right yeah to be expected united states

726.959 --> 733.279
really does have its own

729.2 --> 736.72
weather system and in

733.279 --> 740.24
northwest europe all that it it shares

736.72 --> 741.0400000000001
weather system it's like around the same

740.24 --> 744.16
type of

741.04 --> 748.3199999999999
oceanic area

744.16 --> 751.12
same ocean depth

748.32 --> 751.6800000000001
so it's kind of like the shared system

751.12 --> 759.839
even though

751.68 --> 759.8389999999999
it is opened up to the atlantic

765.519 --> 770.079
gold and gray in upstate new york all

767.839 --> 770.0790000000001
right

782.0 --> 788.88
right so i know i'm up for

786.48 --> 789.6800000000001
for whatever but i do get the feeling

788.88 --> 793.4399999999999
like i

789.68 --> 795.5999999999999
i am at the end of a deal

793.44 --> 797.7600000000001
like i've been doing pretty damn good i

795.6 --> 798.639
think in the last month or maybe two

797.76 --> 801.36
months even or

798.639 --> 803.2
i don't know it's lost it's lasted maybe

801.36 --> 805.36
an entire season

803.2 --> 806.32
of just good performance but like in the

805.36 --> 809.519
last

806.32 --> 812.24
week now i just feel like yeah i'm

809.519 --> 812.24
running out of

812.32 --> 816.9590000000001
out of juice of inspiration and yeah

815.68 --> 819.92
usually that means that

816.959 --> 821.1199999999999
you can't really get it back until you

819.92 --> 824.8
just let things sink

821.12 --> 829.839
that that's my experience so yeah

824.8 --> 829.8389999999999
who knows who knows where it goes

832.88 --> 837.519
did i watch astronaut farmer yes i did

837.839 --> 844.0790000000001
i think i wrote it down

841.04 --> 844.079
can i talk about it

844.24 --> 850.399
yeah watch that on

847.6 --> 850.399
on friday

851.68 --> 856.3199999999999
i don't remember did i mention about it

854.16 --> 858.48
on saturday

856.32 --> 860.88
perhaps i don't remember but i talked

858.48 --> 863.279
about it but yeah i watched it

860.88 --> 864.48
and it brought up all yeah did i talk

863.279 --> 866.72
about it yesterday i don't know

864.48 --> 868.5600000000001
yesterday or the day before i talked

866.72 --> 870.9590000000001
about it on my show

868.56 --> 872.959
because of the weird associations the

870.959 --> 876.7199999999999
weird memories i have about it

872.959 --> 880.4799999999999
from the time i was kind of

876.72 --> 884.24
awoken to flat earth when that movie

880.48 --> 885.9200000000001
got to my attention or i was starting to

884.24 --> 888.16
wake up to it but i was still

885.92 --> 889.68
closed off so it was like a secret

888.16 --> 891.199
awakening

889.68 --> 893.3599999999999
didn't really know what to do with it

891.199 --> 898.0
much

893.36 --> 903.36
and that was 2000 around 2008.

898.0 --> 903.36
and then yeah it i fell asleep again

903.519 --> 912.079
about it what is astronaut former the

908.079 --> 915.68
astronaut farmer is a movie from 2006.

912.079 --> 915.68
and it is quite ridiculous

915.76 --> 923.199
although it is kind of interesting too

920.24 --> 927.839
but it's just a weird mix it's a weird

923.199 --> 927.8389999999999
mix movie

929.68 --> 933.92
and the entire premise of it is just

931.68 --> 935.199
ridiculous but that was also kind of the

933.92 --> 940.16
point

935.199 --> 942.16
i guess

940.16 --> 945.68
i think the entire purpose of the movie

942.16 --> 949.12
is to basically reinforce the idea that

945.68 --> 949.12
literally you could

949.279 --> 952.399
basically take the grabs and go to space

952.0 --> 955.199
but

952.399 --> 957.12
you get a lot of hassle that's kind of

955.199 --> 959.5999999999999
what it suggests now reality that

957.12 --> 962.19
doesn't work like that at all

959.6 --> 964.639
but almost

962.19 --> 966.839
[Music]

964.639 --> 970.639
right you have to get in bed with the

966.839 --> 973.12
government and then as a private company

970.639 --> 974.8
you can do these things but i don't know

973.12 --> 977.04
the details of it i've never tried out

974.8 --> 978.7199999999999
but it seems like elon musk for example

977.04 --> 980.88
is one of these figures

978.72 --> 983.6800000000001
so in a way he is like the astronaut

980.88 --> 986.959
farmer

983.68 --> 986.959
except he's not a farmer

990.079 --> 994.6389999999999
and sometimes i think in this movie that

992.32 --> 996.399
the farmer guy is not really a farmer

994.639 --> 997.6
either he seems to be just freaking

996.399 --> 1001.04
obsessed

997.6 --> 1003.0400000000001
with his with him being an astronaut

1001.04 --> 1005.36
i don't yeah he lives on a farm but i

1003.04 --> 1007.04
don't see him farming

1005.36 --> 1009.36
that was also that also kind of stood

1007.04 --> 1011.279
out like that guy's just squirting over

1009.36 --> 1013.6800000000001
his rocket and building that he's not

1011.279 --> 1013.68
farming

1015.04 --> 1019.36
but i don't know maybe i didn't pay

1017.92 --> 1019.759
attention to that it's just something

1019.36 --> 1021.279
that

1019.759 --> 1023.44
kind of stood out like yeah just

1021.279 --> 1024.559
constantly focusing on him on this

1023.44 --> 1027.1200000000001
rocket and [ __ ]

1024.559 --> 1029.439
working on that where's where's the

1027.12 --> 1032.799
farming

1029.439 --> 1036.48
i don't see it also he he does

1032.799 --> 1038.24
like speeches in front of classes so

1036.48 --> 1041.1200000000001
is he getting paid for it so he's not

1038.24 --> 1045.76
really a farmer he's more like a

1041.12 --> 1045.76
hobby astronaut

1045.839 --> 1051.28
enthusiast that just makes money off his

1048.88 --> 1051.2800000000002
hobby

1051.36 --> 1055.12
yeah and by the way there is financial

1053.36 --> 1058.24
issues with the farm and also

1055.12 --> 1061.1999999999998
so it is kind of stood out like he

1058.24 --> 1062.88
isn't really making any money he's just

1061.2 --> 1066.16
building his hype project with

1062.88 --> 1069.25
giant loans to the bank yeah

1066.16 --> 1072.3200000000002
it's just a ridiculous idea

1069.25 --> 1075.12
[Music]

1072.32 --> 1076.96
it's yeah it's a terrible example really

1075.12 --> 1080.6399999999999
in the movie

1076.96 --> 1083.919
but it was still yeah now watching it

1080.64 --> 1086.88
from the vantage point of where i am

1083.919 --> 1087.5200000000002
psychologically instead of back then it

1086.88 --> 1091.7600000000002
is still

1087.52 --> 1094.0
it was still interesting to watch but i

1091.76 --> 1094.8799999999999
i definitely couldn't have watched it

1094.0 --> 1098.16
back then

1094.88 --> 1101.6000000000001
it would have been too painful

1098.16 --> 1103.28
because i i only recently woke up

1101.6 --> 1105.52
to flat earth and there was nobody to

1103.28 --> 1109.36
share it with really

1105.52 --> 1112.24
except one guy and he later retreated

1109.36 --> 1114.6399999999999
he basically retracted his flat earth

1112.24 --> 1117.919
statement

1114.64 --> 1117.919
because he was threatened

1120.24 --> 1126.72
right i was there when that happened

1123.36 --> 1128.7199999999998
saw him switch it was quite shocking

1126.72 --> 1132.32
shocking enough for me to to also

1128.72 --> 1132.32
completely want to forget about it

1134.84 --> 1140.509
uh

1137.44 --> 1140.509
[Music]

1143.919 --> 1147.76
farming as a metaphor well yeah maybe

1146.799 --> 1151.84
that could be

1147.76 --> 1151.84
random a good point

1157.52 --> 1160.799
yeah i did mention it in rodrigo's chat

1159.6 --> 1165.84
that's right yeah

1160.799 --> 1165.84
you were there too hmm

1169.44 --> 1172.88
oh by the way i had to download this

1171.6 --> 1175.52
movie

1172.88 --> 1177.5200000000002
because i can't find it anywhere and

1175.52 --> 1178.6399999999999
even the download that i had from like

1177.52 --> 1181.36
pirately was

1178.64 --> 1183.679
a super shitty quality it was like

1181.36 --> 1185.76
literally mobile

1183.679 --> 1187.3600000000001
mobile-sized quality that was the best

1185.76 --> 1190.84
that was there

1187.36 --> 1193.84
so i this movie is not very popular i

1190.84 --> 1193.84
think

1202.08 --> 1205.1799999999998
[Music]

1207.47 --> 1210.509
[Music]

1211.6 --> 1217.84
what do you mean michael snod grass

1214.799 --> 1218.48
two once you go flat you don't go back

1217.84 --> 1221.039
unless

1218.48 --> 1223.919
somehow they get the download from this

1221.039 --> 1223.919
what does that mean

1231.44 --> 1235.039
you gotta understand that i was

1233.12 --> 1237.76
basically a

1235.039 --> 1238.1589999999999
space enthusiast who in his back of his

1237.76 --> 1241.52
mind

1238.159 --> 1243.2
wanted to become a space station

1241.52 --> 1246.08
engineer at some point

1243.2 --> 1247.28
was being revealed that it was all

1246.08 --> 1250.0
trickery

1247.28 --> 1251.039
and what happened to me is i became

1250.0 --> 1254.559
jealous of

1251.039 --> 1256.08
of nasa i was like but i want to build

1254.559 --> 1257.76
those space stations whether they're

1256.08 --> 1258.24
real or fake and i want to do a better

1257.76 --> 1262.559
job

1258.24 --> 1267.36
that was my response

1262.559 --> 1270.08
inside because yeah it's kind of weird

1267.36 --> 1270.7199999999998
to express that that was my response

1270.08 --> 1272.6399999999999
inside

1270.72 --> 1276.08
but at the same time i was just very

1272.64 --> 1279.679
shocked now we're talking 2008

1276.08 --> 1283.12
to that between 2008 2010 somewhere

1279.679 --> 1283.1200000000001
just very shocked like what

1285.2 --> 1290.64
it's it's not real but i want to build

1288.84 --> 1293.4399999999998
that

1290.64 --> 1294.88
so okay then i'll just have to i want to

1293.44 --> 1296.64
build it so much

1294.88 --> 1298.96
more than i care whether it is

1296.64 --> 1302.8400000000001
physically real or not

1298.96 --> 1305.3600000000001
because to be fair outer space

1302.84 --> 1307.84
non-atmosphere on earth

1305.36 --> 1309.36
never really appealed to me like as a

1307.84 --> 1312.799
something that i wanted to

1309.36 --> 1314.8799999999999
physically personally experience because

1312.799 --> 1318.24
i had a much better understanding how

1314.88 --> 1320.5590000000002
vacuum really sucks

1318.24 --> 1321.76
it's not a nice thing to be in if you

1320.559 --> 1324.799
know what i mean and i

1321.76 --> 1327.52
realized that very early on

1324.799 --> 1328.72
space is very scary if you really know

1327.52 --> 1333.44
what's going on

1328.72 --> 1337.3600000000001
and kind of the realization

1333.44 --> 1338.0800000000002
like that they kind of draw away the

1337.36 --> 1341.52
attention

1338.08 --> 1343.6
from gas laws how that works

1341.52 --> 1346.0
in the heliocentric model makes a lot of

1343.6 --> 1348.559
sense because if you really know that

1346.0 --> 1350.96
then you also know like how [ __ ] up it

1348.559 --> 1352.0
is to actually be like in a spacesuit in

1350.96 --> 1355.28
a vacuum

1352.0 --> 1356.559
that sort of thing that it doesn't

1355.28 --> 1360.0
really work that it's

1356.559 --> 1363.6
super dangerous and yeah

1360.0 --> 1363.6
that just insane

1364.72 --> 1371.84
but to design space stations

1369.039 --> 1373.36
and all that i just that was always very

1371.84 --> 1376.08
hard to let go

1373.36 --> 1378.32
and then eventually when i was just too

1376.08 --> 1379.039
isolated the guy stepped away because he

1378.32 --> 1381.12
was kind of

1379.039 --> 1382.96
like being blackmailed like okay if

1381.12 --> 1384.4799999999998
you're gonna continue this we're gonna

1382.96 --> 1385.52
make you lose all your jobs and you'll

1384.48 --> 1390.64
never get a job

1385.52 --> 1394.8799999999999
they told him that there i was there

1390.64 --> 1398.96
looking at that man telling him

1394.88 --> 1399.5200000000002
right after that that was so shocking to

1398.96 --> 1402.88
me

1399.52 --> 1405.6
that i just it spiraled

1402.88 --> 1406.96
out it just i didn't have anyone to talk

1405.6 --> 1408.9599999999998
about it anymore and it was so

1406.96 --> 1412.159
frustrating that i just dropped it i

1408.96 --> 1412.159
forgot about it again

1412.96 --> 1417.679
and then things with my girlfriend

1416.4 --> 1421.279
eventually

1417.679 --> 1424.3200000000002
also she rejected it

1421.279 --> 1427.36
my ex now and then yeah it was just

1424.32 --> 1429.4399999999998
so so much rejection i could not find

1427.36 --> 1430.08
anyone to really share it with that i

1429.44 --> 1433.6000000000001
could find

1430.08 --> 1437.1999999999998
respect for i'm not i wasn't just gonna

1433.6 --> 1438.7199999999998
pick up some weirdo conspiracy lunatic

1437.2 --> 1441.1200000000001
because there they were out there as

1438.72 --> 1442.48
well i met bumping them all the time

1441.12 --> 1444.1589999999999
here

1442.48 --> 1445.84
people that just take it way too far

1444.159 --> 1448.159
that have no more like

1445.84 --> 1449.1999999999998
oversight no more structural cohesion in

1448.159 --> 1450.88
their thinking

1449.2 --> 1454.039
you know so they'll believe almost

1450.88 --> 1458.64
anything that that's completely useless

1454.039 --> 1460.48
completely useless to me i need

1458.64 --> 1462.4
somebody that does have structural

1460.48 --> 1466.24
oversight over things and it's one

1462.4 --> 1468.64
in a want to build actually build

1466.24 --> 1470.159
well i have found that community now

1468.64 --> 1472.48
since

1470.159 --> 1474.159
and mark sergeant was like the first

1472.48 --> 1478.4
spark of hope

1474.159 --> 1480.5590000000002
that there are non-delusional flat

1478.4 --> 1482.64
earthers out there because before that

1480.559 --> 1486.96
it just seemed like everyone i bumped

1482.64 --> 1489.3600000000001
into was just they were all either

1486.96 --> 1491.08
keeping it a secret like a very strict

1489.36 --> 1494.08
secret

1491.08 --> 1496.1589999999999
compartmentalizing it or because i

1494.08 --> 1497.6789999999999
bumped into that sort of weirdness too

1496.159 --> 1499.3600000000001
people didn't i didn't know well but it

1497.679 --> 1500.0
just immediately by their response i

1499.36 --> 1503.6789999999999
just knew like

1500.0 --> 1506.32
okay these people keep it a secret

1503.679 --> 1507.3600000000001
they don't want to talk about it and

1506.32 --> 1509.4399999999998
others

1507.36 --> 1510.4799999999998
would talk about it but they would just

1509.44 --> 1512.0800000000002
be yeah and

1510.48 --> 1514.64
they would talk about it like anothers

1512.08 --> 1516.48
because yeah

1514.64 --> 1519.1200000000001
just because you believe in flat earth

1516.48 --> 1523.679
doesn't mean

1519.12 --> 1527.12
that you're not crazy okay

1523.679 --> 1530.72
but the other way around

1527.12 --> 1534.8799999999999
believing in the ball well

1530.72 --> 1535.52
you are at least very ill-informed or

1534.88 --> 1538.4
you have

1535.52 --> 1540.8799999999999
intentions to lie either one there's no

1538.4 --> 1543.1200000000001
other option with flat earth however

1540.88 --> 1546.5590000000002
yeah you can figure that out but it

1543.12 --> 1549.36
doesn't exclude you from being a nutter

1546.559 --> 1550.6399999999999
if you were a nutter in the first place

1549.36 --> 1553.4399999999998
getting on flat earth

1550.64 --> 1557.8400000000001
doesn't take that away from you just so

1553.44 --> 1557.8400000000001
you know

1558.32 --> 1563.9189999999999
and that was very confusing and

1560.48 --> 1563.919
frustrating to me back then

1568.48 --> 1573.679
well now things have changed it's become

1571.84 --> 1576.799
more of a

1573.679 --> 1578.88
normal subject something that can be

1576.799 --> 1582.0
talked about can be discussed that even

1578.88 --> 1585.44
people that have had good schooling

1582.0 --> 1588.08
and have a sound structural mind

1585.44 --> 1589.8400000000001
are tapping into or being part of and

1588.08 --> 1591.84
that was exactly what i've been waiting

1589.84 --> 1594.8799999999999
for that's exactly what i needed

1591.84 --> 1598.559
and it started up in 2015

1594.88 --> 1600.24
and i was just like dying to get into it

1598.559 --> 1603.52
even though i was

1600.24 --> 1605.279
scared for my life at the time i shared

1603.52 --> 1608.72
this i was scared for my life

1605.279 --> 1610.24
i was terrified what would happen

1608.72 --> 1612.08
i didn't know everything that would

1610.24 --> 1615.279
happen i just remembered that i saw

1612.08 --> 1617.36
that guy being threatened to take ever

1615.279 --> 1617.679
to like have his kids taken away and

1617.36 --> 1620.1589999999999
have

1617.679 --> 1622.0800000000002
lose his job never get in any again it's

1620.159 --> 1624.7990000000002
just terrible

1622.08 --> 1625.279
to see that happen to somebody else and

1624.799 --> 1630.1589999999999
then

1625.279 --> 1630.159
watch as they just they give up all hope

1634.559 --> 1638.559
towards yeah dealing with that he just

1637.76 --> 1641.76
stepped away

1638.559 --> 1645.36
from conspiracy entirely just said okay

1641.76 --> 1647.6
i'm just gonna stick to christianity

1645.36 --> 1648.559
and the globe and i don't want to know

1647.6 --> 1651.1999999999998
anymore

1648.559 --> 1651.6
it was very demoralizing for me to to

1651.2 --> 1653.919
get

1651.6 --> 1655.6789999999999
to see that happen to somebody that i

1653.919 --> 1657.679
was at the time

1655.679 --> 1660.0
on an intellectual level with because

1657.679 --> 1662.72
that guy was also very smart he actually

1660.0 --> 1664.24
graduated in physics

1662.72 --> 1666.64
and was really good at it and even

1664.24 --> 1668.72
during his study he was she shared

1666.64 --> 1671.039
with me how so much was wrong with

1668.72 --> 1672.799
physics and it wasn't he wasn't getting

1671.039 --> 1674.24
any recognition for that

1672.799 --> 1677.84
it wasn't being addressed that it was

1674.24 --> 1677.84
back then so it was kind of like a

1678.0 --> 1684.88
you could compare him sort of

1681.44 --> 1687.279
roughly to a dutch qe

1684.88 --> 1688.64
but he wasn't like john at all not he

1687.279 --> 1693.279
wasn't that sort of

1688.64 --> 1696.48
a guy but yeah that

1693.279 --> 1701.12
he was very good at physics probably

1696.48 --> 1704.799
still is he's very smart guy

1701.12 --> 1706.799
the hyperactive type but very smart

1704.799 --> 1708.72
but yeah he went i'm not gonna name

1706.799 --> 1709.679
names of course i don't know if he's if

1708.72 --> 1712.159
he sees this

1709.679 --> 1715.6000000000001
i hope he's not scared i will never

1712.159 --> 1715.6000000000001
reveal your name buddy i know

1715.679 --> 1721.2
i know i understand

1719.12 --> 1722.799
you had you got your little girl to

1721.2 --> 1725.52
worry about because he had

1722.799 --> 1726.8799999999999
just back then was just just had a baby

1725.52 --> 1730.0
baby girl

1726.88 --> 1734.0
she must be now like

1730.0 --> 1736.24
i guess six or seven or eight years old

1734.0 --> 1736.24
now

1737.039 --> 1739.84
anyway

1742.0 --> 1745.44
but yeah at the time he was like a

1743.679 --> 1749.8400000000001
really good friend

1745.44 --> 1753.8400000000001
very very with his heart into it

1749.84 --> 1753.84
he had a great sense of loyalty

1760.0 --> 1766.799
like with him at the time we were trying

1761.76 --> 1770.1589999999999
to figure out hydrogen engines

1766.799 --> 1773.52
and even curious at fig

1770.159 --> 1777.2
yeah figuring out

1773.52 --> 1780.559
like how can you

1777.2 --> 1783.52
kind of like create a

1780.559 --> 1785.6789999999999
an electric closed circle or how do you

1783.52 --> 1788.399
a perpetual energy

1785.679 --> 1788.88
system but not literally but you can

1788.399 --> 1790.9599999999998
make

1788.88 --> 1792.0800000000002
design of things more efficient so that

1790.96 --> 1794.559
it costs very

1792.08 --> 1796.32
like it costs less energy than it should

1794.559 --> 1799.12
in order to keep it going that kind of

1796.32 --> 1800.6399999999999
thing i was very fascinated with that

1799.12 --> 1802.9599999999998
because there were some things coming

1800.64 --> 1804.7990000000002
out about that

1802.96 --> 1808.64
even back then it's like more than 10

1804.799 --> 1810.399
years ago

1808.64 --> 1812.88
but i think there have been a lot of

1810.399 --> 1814.799
secret industrial developments and this

1812.88 --> 1817.3600000000001
guy had like

1814.799 --> 1819.84
connections people that were digging

1817.36 --> 1819.84
into that

1820.32 --> 1825.12
it was just endlessly fascinating to me

1822.64 --> 1828.159
back then

1825.12 --> 1837.84
anyways anybody still left in chat here

1828.159 --> 1837.8400000000001
are you all listening to me

1843.039 --> 1846.48
your friend were tricky was about the

1845.6 --> 1850.48
cross

1846.48 --> 1851.52
over well he wanted to come out for flat

1850.48 --> 1855.76
earth

1851.52 --> 1859.44
officially he he even had

1855.76 --> 1861.279
like a small lectures about it

1859.44 --> 1862.799
that involved it as well conspiracy

1861.279 --> 1864.72
theories in general he was just into

1862.799 --> 1866.32
conspiracy theories a lot

1864.72 --> 1868.72
he knew a lot of different one he has a

1866.32 --> 1871.36
lot of books and bookstore

1868.72 --> 1873.44
and he did just these lectures and also

1871.36 --> 1875.6789999999999
about flat earth

1873.44 --> 1876.88
and he really thought that it was that

1875.679 --> 1879.8400000000001
he could just do that

1876.88 --> 1879.8400000000001
and then he got threatened

1882.08 --> 1893.84
and that really scared him

1899.279 --> 1904.84
all right but who knows maybe maybe

1901.44 --> 1907.519
that's because it was back then maybe

1904.84 --> 1909.9189999999999
now his chance

1907.519 --> 1912.72
his stance has changed i don't know i

1909.919 --> 1915.779
don't want to bother him with it

1912.72 --> 1915.779
[Music]

1916.72 --> 1923.2
maybe he'll just bump into me eventually

1920.0 --> 1935.84
and decide to seek me out i don't know

1923.2 --> 1935.8400000000001
we'll see

1951.679 --> 1955.039
right anyway this is all this stuff is

1954.559 --> 1958.0
like

1955.039 --> 1958.0
a decade ago

1960.96 --> 1977.8400000000001
how time has flown since then incredible

1978.159 --> 1991.8400000000001
man youtube keeps stalling on me

1994.64 --> 1998.7990000000002
you got your first jolt of waking up on

1997.84 --> 2001.6
911

1998.799 --> 2002.72
sir all right michael snodgrass well so

2001.6 --> 2005.84
did i

2002.72 --> 2008.32
although even not completely

2005.84 --> 2010.48
i knew there was something wrong but i

2008.32 --> 2014.24
didn't understand yet

2010.48 --> 2017.44
about the new world order i did i just

2014.24 --> 2018.48
thought it was just america that i was

2017.44 --> 2020.159
oversimplifying

2018.48 --> 2022.159
like that and hey the media was all

2020.159 --> 2024.48
echoing they were all anti-bush

2022.159 --> 2026.5590000000002
over here in the netherlands it's just

2024.48 --> 2027.039
it's just america you know they were

2026.559 --> 2029.039
really

2027.039 --> 2031.36
just a straw man to make everybody blame

2029.039 --> 2034.399
america and the media was working

2031.36 --> 2037.279
into that fully literally

2034.399 --> 2038.8799999999999
and i didn't know i didn't realize that

2037.279 --> 2042.08
and then later

2038.88 --> 2042.72
when obama got in everything switched

2042.08 --> 2045.4399999999998
around and

2042.72 --> 2046.72
suddenly it was all great and that

2045.44 --> 2050.0
creeped me out

2046.72 --> 2050.7200000000003
so bad it literally mortified me when

2050.0 --> 2053.04
that happened

2050.72 --> 2053.7599999999998
to see everything switch around and

2053.04 --> 2057.359
everybody

2053.76 --> 2060.8
literally literally

2057.359 --> 2062.0
worshipping that [ __ ] guy through the

2060.8 --> 2064.0
television and

2062.0 --> 2065.04
like the news was literally presenting

2064.0 --> 2068.24
him like he was

2065.04 --> 2074.079
a new god or something is so sick

2068.24 --> 2077.359
so sick oh god what a terrible time

2074.079 --> 2080.32
now that really woke me up that

2077.359 --> 2081.359
really woke me up that really woke up a

2080.32 --> 2084.7200000000003
lot of people

2081.359 --> 2086.879
i think and that's

2084.72 --> 2088.24
also when like the social justice

2086.879 --> 2091.7599999999998
warrior revolution

2088.24 --> 2091.7599999999998
started to happen everywhere

2092.96 --> 2097.52
it's yeah that's when all that [ __ ] has

2096.72 --> 2099.7599999999998
started to has

2097.52 --> 2102.0
started really started to unfold and

2099.76 --> 2106.96
when like the first level coming

2102.0 --> 2108.8
out of of the dark ones pretty much

2106.96 --> 2110.56
but before that i just didn't know i

2108.8 --> 2113.28
just thought it was oh america

2110.56 --> 2113.2799999999997
american

2115.359 --> 2119.52
and yeah there was mostly thanks to alex

2117.44 --> 2120.85
jones because at that time i was already

2119.52 --> 2122.88
into alex jones

2120.85 --> 2126.96
[Music]

2122.88 --> 2130.7200000000003
uh i got i really kind of got into him

2126.96 --> 2133.52
in 2008.

2130.72 --> 2135.52
before that a little in 2006 was like

2133.52 --> 2138.24
the first time i saw a movie as his it

2135.52 --> 2141.7599999999998
was called terror storm

2138.24 --> 2144.64
and that really laid it out

2141.76 --> 2145.8390000000004
more yeah more than ever but then yeah

2144.64 --> 2148.48
and then 2008

2145.839 --> 2151.359
i like subscribed to prisonplanet.tv and

2148.48 --> 2154.72
he really got into alex jones like

2151.359 --> 2158.0789999999997
a lot and i had my own forum

2154.72 --> 2159.7599999999998
where i would repost his articles

2158.079 --> 2161.44
because back then that was kind of

2159.76 --> 2163.76
revolutionary

2161.44 --> 2164.48
now just the entire internet spammed

2163.76 --> 2167.28
full with that

2164.48 --> 2167.76
fully automated back then that was new

2167.28 --> 2169.599
stuff

2167.76 --> 2171.2000000000003
back then there was like whoa

2169.599 --> 2174.2400000000002
alternative

2171.2 --> 2175.9199999999996
medical revelations like look all these

2174.24 --> 2177.2799999999997
herbs work against this and that and

2175.92 --> 2187.839
that is just like whoa

2177.28 --> 2187.8390000000004
dude i learned so much i learned a lot

2187.92 --> 2190.16
right

2196.16 --> 2203.04
but yeah the 911 was like the

2200.0 --> 2203.76
it was the first wake up call not as

2203.04 --> 2207.52
much

2203.76 --> 2210.4
even like oh they're

2207.52 --> 2211.52
like oh the world is not what it seems

2210.4 --> 2215.119
but it was just

2211.52 --> 2218.32
a a big a big poke it was just a

2215.119 --> 2220.88
like yeah like a giant stump

2218.32 --> 2222.56
that that was kind of like said starting

2220.88 --> 2225.6800000000003
to it broke

2222.56 --> 2228.72
the piece it literally broke the the

2225.68 --> 2229.9199999999996
the general atmosphere of peace on which

2228.72 --> 2232.56
by the way

2229.92 --> 2235.04
the liberal apparatus was writing was

2232.56 --> 2237.44
riding on that piece on that trust

2235.04 --> 2239.44
and that made things work in that way

2237.44 --> 2242.8
now after that point

2239.44 --> 2245.839
that got crushed it it didn't

2242.8 --> 2247.76
really work anymore

2245.839 --> 2250.24
people were getting dissatisfied and

2247.76 --> 2250.96
then eventually like the liberals

2250.24 --> 2254.0
responded

2250.96 --> 2254.839
with just their deepening down on the

2254.0 --> 2257.92
marxist

2254.839 --> 2261.92
system and they basically

2257.92 --> 2261.92
dropped the nice looking mask

2263.68 --> 2270.0789999999997
during obama and everybody was all

2266.96 --> 2285.839
being enthralled and chanted into

2270.079 --> 2285.8390000000004
worshipping obama through the tv

2304.24 --> 2306.4799999999996
right

2311.68 --> 2327.839
pulses of energy what what do you mean

2314.72 --> 2327.839
good servant

2329.76 --> 2335.44
there's energy everywhere it all depends

2332.079 --> 2341.8390000000004
on what you're going to zone in on

2335.44 --> 2341.839
so could you be more specific concerned

2352.839 --> 2355.839
hmm

2373.76 --> 2378.2400000000002
that doesn't sound very healthy good

2375.839 --> 2378.24
servant

2378.64 --> 2383.839
are you sure that's your spirit

2408.839 --> 2411.839
so

2420.4 --> 2427.28
and joist and woozy

2424.88 --> 2427.28
all right

2435.44 --> 2453.839
oh i get look that's just the way the

2439.04 --> 2453.839
body functions you know it's

2458.24 --> 2461.4399999999996
you feel energized and woozy well look

2460.4 --> 2464.7200000000003
this is

2461.44 --> 2467.119
i well i've noticed that especially i do

2464.72 --> 2470.24
stretches a lot right well that makes me

2467.119 --> 2472.48
feel like that exactly

2470.24 --> 2473.9199999999996
it just it keeps the blood going and it

2472.48 --> 2477.119
kind of like

2473.92 --> 2478.64
gives an extra pump of oxygen i think

2477.119 --> 2482.079
so i think that is probably what your

2478.64 --> 2482.0789999999997
experience is just increased

2492.839 --> 2495.839
oxygen

2496.72 --> 2509.839
okay cameron gilmore

2522.56 --> 2537.839
yeah good servant but you do take

2524.72 --> 2537.839
medication right

2566.93 --> 2570.79
[Music]

2571.359 --> 2579.839
anyway um all right got 15 more minutes

2575.68 --> 2582.16
for the flat of the baits oh

2579.839 --> 2582.88
i do kind of want to get some groceries

2582.16 --> 2588.319
in this nice

2582.88 --> 2588.319
weather before the rain clouds come back

2590.839 --> 2607.839
anyway it stop

2593.599 --> 2607.839
yeah then it's probably just oxygen

2615.52 --> 2620.16
that's what i experience oxygen does

2617.52 --> 2624.24
typically just give you a sense of a lot

2620.16 --> 2624.24
of energy but it also makes you woozy

2629.28 --> 2635.8390000000004
otherwise i don't know what it is

2667.28 --> 2673.119
okay a good sir yeah i don't know if i

2670.4 --> 2674.079
want to talk about that publicly if you

2673.119 --> 2678.88
do

2674.079 --> 2681.8390000000004
but why do you have to take them exactly

2678.88 --> 2682.88
is it like some kind of a mandate thing

2681.839 --> 2691.44
or

2682.88 --> 2704.54
do you really need it

2691.44 --> 2708.32
right all right i understand

2704.54 --> 2708.32
[Music]

2709.76 --> 2713.0400000000004
all right so

2714.48 --> 2721.359
anything interesting somebody

2717.76 --> 2721.3590000000004
can bring to my attention

2721.44 --> 2736.079
anything happening just recently

2733.28 --> 2736.079
what is this

2743.2 --> 2747.5989999999997
huh i'm just seeing a notification i'd

2745.839 --> 2750.48
missed a lot of notifications from

2747.599 --> 2755.04
things happening yesterday

2750.48 --> 2755.04
this is it seems interesting from nathan

2758.839 --> 2761.839
thompson

2772.839 --> 2776.64
oh oh

2776.88 --> 2785.6800000000003
okay it's not yeah it's just

2782.079 --> 2788.4
a fact jack video supposedly in about

2785.68 --> 2790.8799999999997
usa today basically admitting that nasa

2788.4 --> 2792.8
was founded by nazi from paperclip

2790.88 --> 2794.1600000000003
that's it i thought there was somebody

2792.8 --> 2796.96
was gonna

2794.16 --> 2798.0
they were saying this is true about for

2796.96 --> 2799.76
example that

2798.0 --> 2801.04
yeah that you can't have gas pressure

2799.76 --> 2802.079
without a container sort of thing but

2801.04 --> 2806.16
it's not about that

2802.079 --> 2806.1600000000003
it seems too bad

2810.319 --> 2813.7599999999998
gleam was on with fight to flat earth

2812.48 --> 2817.76
and team skeptic

just blah blah blah talking about the

2854.079 --> 2859.8390000000004
weather or something i don't know

2860.079 --> 2864.88
a good conversation a good conversation

2862.559 --> 2868.4
about god i take it they didn't talk

2864.88 --> 2868.4
about flat earth or the glow

2868.559 --> 2872.3190000000004
because i don't know how else it's going

2870.24 --> 2874.5589999999997
to be a good conversation with those

2872.319 --> 2874.5589999999997
guys

2879.52 --> 2884.319
fairly deep physics okay

2885.2 --> 2889.68
oh god oh you you call that a good

2888.64 --> 2893.1189999999997
conversation

2889.68 --> 2897.2
jesus ah

2893.119 --> 2900.7200000000003
you mean a total [ __ ] fast tiny womble

2897.2 --> 2904.16
about the eater god

2900.72 --> 2907.1189999999997
yeah because everybody needs to know

2904.16 --> 2915.839
freight flat earth's opinion about ether

2907.119 --> 2915.839
physics right

2918.8 --> 2929.8390000000004
yeah it was respectful but very stupid

2922.319 --> 2929.839
that's yeah that's very nice

2932.559 --> 2936.4
yeah well if they're gonna talk about

2934.0 --> 2943.839
complete nonsense then i'm sure they can

2936.4 --> 2943.839
be respectful to one another

2945.75 --> 2948.889
[Music]

2954.839 --> 2957.839
uh

2962.0 --> 2965.68
all right so yeah that's not noteworthy

2965.04 --> 2970.48
but

2965.68 --> 2985.839
thanks uh

2970.48 --> 2985.839
anything else

3009.68 --> 3016.24
won't even entertain the subject

3013.359 --> 3016.72
well i've explained it so many times

3016.24 --> 3020.0
light

3016.72 --> 3021.7599999999998
does not require a special medium in

3020.0 --> 3026.72
order for it to be a wave

3021.76 --> 3030.1600000000003
it's just wrong it's very stupid

3026.72 --> 3033.5989999999997
light falls outside of the wave

3030.16 --> 3041.839
particle false dichotomy duality

3033.599 --> 3041.839
it's very simple

3044.48 --> 3048.96
right yeah i prefer to think of it as a

3048.0 --> 3051.92
beam because

3048.96 --> 3053.119
it's at least visual and auditive an

3051.92 --> 3056.64
alternative

3053.119 --> 3057.44
to a particle or wave a beam yeah an

3056.64 --> 3060.48
infinitely

3057.44 --> 3060.48
divisible beam

3060.96 --> 3069.839
that would be my best description for it

3082.079 --> 3086.7200000000003
okay sc montreal really he made them

3084.72 --> 3092.3999999999996
look like clowns

3086.72 --> 3092.3999999999996
how when they're talking about ether

3092.559 --> 3098.3190000000004
how how is he made how did he make them

3096.559 --> 3100.88
look like clowns you tell me i see

3098.319 --> 3100.88
montreal

3107.92 --> 3114.8
yeah rob h but it's also defo not a wave

3111.76 --> 3117.8390000000004
not in the mechanical physics

3114.8 --> 3125.8390000000004
sense of what a wave is it's not that

3117.839 --> 3125.839
light is not a wave

3136.559 --> 3140.48
there is elec electric

3140.8 --> 3147.599
ether well yeah sure that's

3144.0 --> 3147.599
that's what tesla was talking about

3148.079 --> 3151.28
it's just the electricity in the air

3150.24 --> 3154.9599999999996
that is not

3151.28 --> 3154.96
just typical

3155.599 --> 3159.6800000000003
in the form of electricity that we get

3158.079 --> 3163.04
to know here on earth

3159.68 --> 3166.0
the ones that we make and all that but

3163.04 --> 3167.44
there is electric energy in the air and

3166.0 --> 3169.359
that could be

3167.44 --> 3171.839
considered as the electric ether that's

3169.359 --> 3175.52
the that's the ether that i accept

3171.839 --> 3181.839
it's electrical light wave medium

3175.52 --> 3181.839
no absolutely not

3182.0 --> 3186.16
right rob h wave is an effect

3186.88 --> 3191.2000000000003
it's something that happens to something

3189.68 --> 3193.359
else

3191.2 --> 3195.04
a wave in itself is nothing it's

3193.359 --> 3198.0789999999997
basically a pattern

3195.04 --> 3201.2
it's a pattern that for example say

3198.079 --> 3204.2400000000002
sound sound is a wave

3201.2 --> 3206.3999999999996
a wave distribution effect like it's a

3204.24 --> 3210.72
mechanical effect

3206.4 --> 3210.7200000000003
that happens with air

3210.8 --> 3214.1600000000003
and the way it's just dividing itself

3212.96 --> 3216.96
that makes

3214.16 --> 3219.1189999999997
it into a wave that we can identify and

3216.96 --> 3222.079
pick up as sound

3219.119 --> 3225.28
but it's basically the matter and the

3222.079 --> 3225.28
displacement thereof

3225.839 --> 3229.839
well light is not that light is its own

3228.319 --> 3232.64
substance

3229.839 --> 3233.2799999999997
and it does not require some kind of

3232.64 --> 3236.7999999999997
medium

3233.28 --> 3238.6400000000003
in order to try and justify to yourself

3236.8 --> 3242.2400000000002
that it is a wave

3238.64 --> 3246.24
just because it doesn't respond directly

3242.24 --> 3248.24
like a regular particle of matter would

3246.24 --> 3250.5589999999997
because there is yeah the diffraction

3248.24 --> 3253.5989999999997
cascade effect which is

3250.559 --> 3256.7200000000003
much more present with

3253.599 --> 3258.1600000000003
light diffraction as it did with matter

3256.72 --> 3260.319
diffraction

3258.16 --> 3262.8799999999997
supposedly which only splits off in like

3260.319 --> 3262.88
two or three

3263.2 --> 3269.68
subsections and with light it's infinite

3267.119 --> 3270.88
it's infinite sections and only light

3269.68 --> 3273.5989999999997
does that by the way

3270.88 --> 3278.0
just for the record only light other

3273.599 --> 3280.1600000000003
things don't do that

3278.0 --> 3281.28
but that's a unique property of light

3280.16 --> 3283.52
and i call it

3281.28 --> 3285.2000000000003
the cause i point at which i haven't

3283.52 --> 3288.48
proven scientifically

3285.2 --> 3290.799
i'm trying to figure it out but my cause

3288.48 --> 3293.599
in my conception my

3290.799 --> 3294.079
attempt to engineer what light is is

3293.599 --> 3296.0
that

3294.079 --> 3298.0
there is a unique property and it's

3296.0 --> 3298.88
called what i call is the diffraction

3298.0 --> 3301.92
cascade

3298.88 --> 3304.7200000000003
because it is a cascade matter

3301.92 --> 3306.16
diffracts too you know up to a certain

3304.72 --> 3308.48
degree and that's why you get a couple

3306.16 --> 3312.48
of extra spikes in those tests

3308.48 --> 3314.96
but light doesn't just split up

3312.48 --> 3315.92
like that no no light there's like a

3314.96 --> 3320.48
cascade it

3315.92 --> 3322.48
it splits up like indefinitely

3320.48 --> 3324.16
and that's because of the diffraction

3322.48 --> 3326.4
cascade that's the only

3324.16 --> 3328.5589999999997
name that i can even assign to it it's a

3326.4 --> 3332.079
cascade it's not just simple diffraction

3328.559 --> 3335.0400000000004
not a simple deviation no it's a cascade

3332.079 --> 3335.8390000000004
it's a unique effect it happens to light

3335.04 --> 3338.799
only

3335.839 --> 3339.599
only to light like that other things may

3338.799 --> 3344.0
split up

3339.599 --> 3348.0
but not in a diffraction cascade sense

3344.0 --> 3351.2
that is where i draw the line

3348.0 --> 3352.799
of distinction between that between

3351.2 --> 3356.72
light and matter

3352.799 --> 3356.72
because there is a distinct difference

3360.72 --> 3366.48
but yeah that that unique property the

3363.68 --> 3368.72
diffraction cascade unique to light

3366.48 --> 3369.52
does not make light a wave it just gives

3368.72 --> 3372.24
it another

3369.52 --> 3373.68
unique property when interacting with

3372.24 --> 3376.0
matter because that is

3373.68 --> 3377.1189999999997
the antecedent for the diffraction

3376.0 --> 3380.559
cascade effect

3377.119 --> 3380.96
it has to be some kind of interaction

3380.559 --> 3386.96
with

3380.96 --> 3389.04
matter that is not perfectly translucent

3386.96 --> 3392.64
there has to be some kind of obstruction

3389.04 --> 3395.2
in order for the effect to set in

3392.64 --> 3396.0
and i'm i'm interested to try and find

3395.2 --> 3405.839
out how

3396.0 --> 3405.839
how that works what it really is

3407.2 --> 3410.8799999999997
yeah tiny one more correct i appreciate

3409.599 --> 3414.88
it

3410.88 --> 3414.88
i'm not i'm not telling you

3415.04 --> 3419.839
that you're doing anything wrong

3447.28 --> 3452.4
and quantum mechanics is bringing back

3449.44 --> 3452.4
quantum foam

3458.839 --> 3461.839
what

3468.559 --> 3471.6800000000003
in order for something to wave it has to

3471.04 --> 3475.2
wave

3471.68 --> 3477.44
through something well yeah but that's

3475.2 --> 3479.5989999999997
also like a formal logical fallacy

3477.44 --> 3483.359
situation p therefore q

3479.599 --> 3484.48
q therefore p not so much just because a

3483.359 --> 3488.16
wave

3484.48 --> 3490.079
has to yeah can be established under

3488.16 --> 3492.48
those circumstances

3490.079 --> 3494.0
does not mean that just because light

3492.48 --> 3498.799
seems to behave

3494.0 --> 3501.28
wave like that it is therefore a wave

3498.799 --> 3502.079
because they're very much reversed

3501.28 --> 3504.96
elements

3502.079 --> 3504.96
about it as well

3505.92 --> 3512.4
like why

3509.68 --> 3513.5989999999997
yeah when the medium has a higher

3512.4 --> 3517.44
diffraction

3513.599 --> 3520.7200000000003
limit a refraction limit sorry

3517.44 --> 3524.16
then it acts differently so

3520.72 --> 3524.16
and then if it if it's

3524.24 --> 3527.7599999999998
i think all that if it then exit that

3527.119 --> 3530.799
high

3527.76 --> 3533.3590000000004
high refraction medium then it just

3530.799 --> 3536.4
returns back to normal and that

3533.359 --> 3536.4
is quite unique

3539.04 --> 3542.64
and besides light is the only thing that

3541.359 --> 3545.7599999999998
can even propel

3542.64 --> 3549.2
itself right through solid matter it's

3545.76 --> 3549.2000000000003
the only thing that could do that

3554.72 --> 3560.0789999999997
right yeah i'm gonna round out the show

3557.92 --> 3561.52
so thanks everyone for coming

3560.079 --> 3563.2000000000003
i hope you liked the show i thought it

3561.52 --> 3565.599
was okay

3563.2 --> 3569.4399999999996
uh yeah good conversation at the end

3565.599 --> 3569.44
thank you tiny wumbo for bringing it up

3569.92 --> 3575.44
and yeah i'm i'm open to

3573.2 --> 3576.64
basically expand upon that conversation

3575.44 --> 3578.96
again

3576.64 --> 3580.64
because it's gonna take a long time for

3578.96 --> 3584.0
people to even

3580.64 --> 3585.92
get what i mean even though i'm

3584.0 --> 3586.16
explaining it and i have been explaining

3585.92 --> 3590.48
it

3586.16 --> 3593.839
for for years now the concept the base

3590.48 --> 3596.64
root why i think the way i do

3593.839 --> 3598.4
anyway if you like the show then please

3596.64 --> 3600.16
don't forget to rogan's it up and if you

3598.4 --> 3601.599
haven't already subscribe to my channel

3600.16 --> 3602.8799999999997
and hit the bell notification so you

3601.599 --> 3605.04

3602.88 --> 3605.92
which is normally 2 p.m amsterdam time

3605.04 --> 3607.839
every day

3605.92 --> 3609.44
and please also do support me through

3607.839 --> 3611.68
the paypal patreon the super chat and

3609.44 --> 3614.7200000000003
the membership system join button

3611.68 --> 3620.48
much appreciated please

3614.72 --> 3622.9599999999996
do support me it does help a lot and

3620.48 --> 3624.0
yeah still have to get through the month

3622.96 --> 3629.44
even though

3624.0 --> 3632.079
the start was pretty good uh

3629.44 --> 3634.64
right i will be back tomorrow flat earth

3632.079 --> 3635.76
early bird number 689

3634.64 --> 3638.0789999999997
and i'm going to join the flight earth

3635.76 --> 3639.44
debates which i think has already

3638.079 --> 3642.6400000000003
started up

3639.44 --> 3657.2200000000003
hashtag mifa indeed obermoco

3642.64 --> 3668.839
and until the next video keep it flat

3657.22 --> 3670.72
[Music]

3668.839 --> 3677.45
so

3670.72 --> 3677.45
[Music]

3682.799 --> 3684.88
you
