37.11 --> 44.23
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

40.9 --> 45.94
early-bird number 301 I'm your host

44.23 --> 47.62
Arwen and before I start show please

45.94 --> 49.69
don't forget to share it on any platform

47.62 --> 51.699

51.699 --> 55.48
the bell notification so you know when

53.44 --> 58.15
I'm going live which is normally 2:00

55.48 --> 60.55
p.m. amsterdam time every day please

58.15 --> 63.489
also do support my channel through the

60.55 --> 67.53
paypal patreon my GoFundMe and the super

63.489 --> 73.38
chats that would be much appreciated so

67.53 --> 73.38
today the weather again quite beautiful

75.33 --> 78.84
nice and sunny

81.78 --> 94.89
so September doesn't seem all that bad

87.72 --> 101.24
so far beside a few like to stormy rainy

94.89 --> 105.06
weeks it's really nice so laughter one

101.24 --> 110.85
to me I got Tamara coffee with me tea

105.06 --> 111.45
and my breakfast because I was up quite

110.85 --> 115.229
late

111.45 --> 120.33
surprisingly I don't know grantees kept

115.229 --> 123.6
me up all night I think and after

120.33 --> 126.36
certain point I just kind of kept stayed

123.6 --> 128.789
up so as a result I was up after twelve

126.36 --> 132.51
o'clock there was long let a long time

128.789 --> 140.27999999999997
since last did that so I'm a bit

132.51 --> 143.85
confused because I'm up maybe maybe just

140.28 --> 147.03
one and a half hours

143.85 --> 149.45
I also yeah got my breakfast so and I'm

147.03 --> 149.45
kind of hungry

152.319 --> 159.81
yeah there don't seem to be any

154.36 --> 159.81
chemtrails today not yet anyway

171.94 --> 175.27
[Music]

177.78 --> 188.23
so let's see was in chat stone monkey 3d

185.8 --> 193.69
it was first a gem

188.23 --> 198.51999999999998
Steve Amanda young Brenda M oh cool

193.69 --> 202.82999999999998
Renta flutter who meets can stop a

198.52 --> 209.73000000000002
traffic I'm arrest I had bandsaw bended

202.83 --> 213.28
Don Diego yeah good to see you all mmm

209.73 --> 218.17
grant he kept me up pretty late but it

213.28 --> 220.36
was interesting and also hilarious that

218.17 --> 225.51
guy what's his name again

220.36 --> 229.96
Phillip I think remind me again Randy

225.51 --> 234.13
who this supposed math teacher or

229.96 --> 237.01000000000002
something was he refused to reveal

234.13 --> 242.76
anything any little detail about his

237.01 --> 246.88
life apparently because yeah when he

242.76 --> 249.22
proceeded to all drive us all insane for

246.88 --> 253.0
an hour non-stop including you around he

249.22 --> 256.69
because I couldn't he saw it in a way it

253.0 --> 258.82
was kind of funny I guess in the same

256.69 --> 262.39
way that people find it funny when I get

258.82 --> 266.68
aggravated next sitting next to Nathan

262.39 --> 272.95
on the panel when some baller goes all

266.68 --> 274.72
delusional there but yeah the guy had

272.95 --> 276.76
just ate a tier-one

274.72 --> 282.76000000000005
understanding of the situation it was

276.76 --> 284.65
absolutely embarrassing but and that

282.76 --> 287.34999999999997
became plenty obvious of course when

284.65 --> 290.34999999999997
Riley put him to the test although he

287.35 --> 292.81
barely got it yet the guy was really

290.35 --> 295.39000000000004
rumbling he did definitely at the end

292.81 --> 300.07
figure out that he was in over his head

295.39 --> 302.71
it took some time I think the guy isn't

300.07 --> 305.84
just a slow talker he's just slow in

302.71 --> 308.75
general he's like off the old block

305.84 --> 314.84
type a teacher that was untouched that

308.75 --> 316.43
people just leave like it is and he's

314.84 --> 318.42999999999995
never been through anything like this

316.43 --> 321.86
before

318.43 --> 324.44
through real confrontations fundamental

321.86 --> 328.13
confrontations people probably never or

324.44 --> 332.71
barely ever done that to him especially

328.13 --> 335.39
not his students if he even has students

332.71 --> 341.71999999999997
across the way that he portrayed his

335.39 --> 344.57
knowledge I don't know he is either a

341.72 --> 349.18
kindergarten teacher like on the level

344.57 --> 353.46999999999997
of conspiracy or he's just a complete

349.18 --> 356.81
actor he's a LARP he's just somebody

353.47 --> 360.70000000000005
acting like his teacher in order to get

356.81 --> 363.82
an angle to this YouTube situation and

360.7 --> 367.57
he's basically yeah a pretender clown

363.82 --> 370.04
trying to get in the the baller

367.57 --> 372.65
enthusiasm on his side to make some

370.04 --> 374.57
money or something or maybe just really

372.65 --> 376.90999999999997
wants attention and in the real world

374.57 --> 379.49
nobody likes him could be whatever

376.91 --> 381.62
reason but he just doesn't seem like a

379.49 --> 388.52
real teacher he didn't seem like a real

381.62 --> 391.7
teacher to me not yeah even if you if

388.52 --> 395.9
you would put that guy in a class we'll

391.7 --> 399.32
say eighteen year olds that are known to

395.9 --> 402.59
be pretty smart even if they weren't

399.32 --> 406.15999999999997
flat earthers or anything he would get

402.59 --> 411.91999999999996
destroyed pretty quickly because the guy

406.16 --> 415.66
just his knowledge is flimsy he seemed

411.92 --> 418.7
to have spent more time on the way he

415.66 --> 421.79
puts it all down and seeming very

418.7 --> 423.5
confident than working on the actual

421.79 --> 426.61
structure and the content of what he

423.5 --> 431.84
seems to be explaining very story

426.61 --> 435.58000000000004
oriented type of talk not technical the

431.84 --> 439.46
guy is a complete idiot

435.58 --> 442.60999999999996
and usually I don't say it even out loud

439.46 --> 446.68
that quickly with somebody coming on the

442.61 --> 450.68
scene ooh but you can't get around it

446.68 --> 452.27
either he really took us all for a bunch

450.68 --> 456.65000000000003
of dummies and that he was basically

452.27 --> 459.08
just putting up a bottom layer story for

456.65 --> 460.88
dummies because he expected us all to be

459.08 --> 463.19
dummies because we flood earthers and he

460.88 --> 468.40999999999997
literally never once in his life really

463.19 --> 471.35
looked into that or he really is that

468.41 --> 481.21000000000004
dumb and we'll find out soon enough

471.35 --> 487.61
I think anyway ask and receive thank you

481.21 --> 490.03999999999996
310 first show I am am i winning with a

487.61 --> 495.95
IJ that's funny

490.04 --> 501.41
thanks for that and a good compliment

495.95 --> 504.28999999999996
right well thank you I it's been bit of

501.41 --> 508.07000000000005
a task to keep it up because I wasn't

504.29 --> 511.34000000000003
always that motivated and to be fair at

508.07 --> 514.88
least the last 100 probably more

511.34 --> 517.37
episodes I'm pretty much I hope it

514.88 --> 519.56
doesn't show too much try not to be too

517.37 --> 522.83
open about your but I some yeah I am

519.56 --> 527.15
struggling sometimes to basically keep

522.83 --> 529.46
up the energy level and get good content

527.15 --> 533.48
out it although look my chat has been

529.46 --> 538.33
saving me a lot so so many people in

533.48 --> 540.77
here that also have their own study and

538.33 --> 543.61
they know what's going on and I've

540.77 --> 546.62
really thankful that you're always here

543.61 --> 548.39
giving me good hints telling me like our

546.62 --> 549.98
our way and did you see the show when it

548.39 --> 553.46
was really good I really like that

549.98 --> 556.25
because I'm not a master at just keeping

553.46 --> 559.7
track what's going on with hundreds and

556.25 --> 562.86
hundreds of people not at all

559.7 --> 564.99
so I really appreciate you guys always

562.86 --> 567.95
being there it's part of the show

564.99 --> 567.95
basically in check

571.43 --> 583.2199999999999
what okay don't know what that was for

580.92 --> 583.2199999999999
but

592.96 --> 595.77
right

598.339 --> 604.71
yes stop a traffic him arrest dad he

601.08 --> 610.11
said that right well I said that as well

604.71 --> 613.32
but yeah the funny thing about it is

610.11 --> 617.63
that it's as big as the heliocentric

613.32 --> 621.8100000000001
model claims Jupiter to be because

617.63 --> 624.51
whatever the size of Earth of the

621.81 --> 627.5699999999999
presumed potential globe of the earth

624.51 --> 631.74
could be when it is very large Jupiter

627.57 --> 633.839
is not actually that size that's the

631.74 --> 636.05
ironic thing is about about that and

633.839 --> 641.5400000000001
they're still not gonna be any space

636.05 --> 641.54
there may be a lot of error though and

642.32 --> 648.5100000000001
there would be some weird things going

644.82 --> 651.779
on like why if the earth is that giant

648.51 --> 655.83
ball why is there a directionality to

651.779 --> 659.91
the relative density spectrum of all

655.83 --> 663.029
things that will be very weird would get

659.91 --> 665.8199999999999
almost Newtonian again in the suggestive

663.029 --> 668.88
nature of it but yeah we don't know you

665.82 --> 673.38
know look even if the earth surface

668.88 --> 676.2
combined seems to be giant ly giant lead

673.38 --> 681.12
spherical that doesn't even guarantee

676.2 --> 683.9100000000001
that it is that it has a core okay it

681.12 --> 685.95
could be that it's just a layer in

683.91 --> 687.8389999999999
between that interconnects like a sphere

685.95 --> 691.339
and that at some point there is a bottom

687.839 --> 696.95
and you just can't go deeper on that

691.339 --> 696.95
giant sphere you don't know yeah

698.32 --> 705.5790000000001
but I agree if you say Rasta that the

702.91 --> 709.87
idea of earth potentially turning out to

705.579 --> 711.9699999999999
be a giant Jupiter sized ball is really

709.87 --> 717.18
remote compared to the other

711.97 --> 717.1800000000001
possibilities I totally agree on that

721.39 --> 737.62
I don't know I think that maybe bringing

734.98 --> 742.779
that up from Raleigh and to be fair from

737.62 --> 746.38
myself is in a way kind of like throwing

742.779 --> 749.829
the ballers and nickel like saying like

746.38 --> 752.529
yeah yeah yeah well you know it seems

749.829 --> 755.3389999999999
like you are totally getting absolutely

752.529 --> 758.709
smashed and everything and you are and

755.339 --> 762.85
it's really sad and kind of want to walk

758.709 --> 766.3
away but you can but look in the near

762.85 --> 769.36
future or far future well it turns out

766.3 --> 771.2199999999999
that after all this punishment the earth

769.36 --> 773.41
may turn out to be a giant ball after

771.22 --> 776.4100000000001
all so there may be some glimmer of hope

773.41 --> 782.079
in the in the future that is kind of

776.41 --> 784.779
what that is when Riley and me say the

782.079 --> 789.55
earth may turn out to be a jupiter-sized

784.779 --> 792.66
ball after all that is what that is it's

789.55 --> 795.449
really throwing the ballers a nickel I

792.66 --> 798.25
hope you understand what that means

795.449 --> 800.79
throw them a nickel and send them on

798.25 --> 800.79
nowhere

825.66 --> 828.88
[Music]

834.19 --> 837.6
what are you guys talking about

842.15 --> 847.16
hello Ronnie fashi why do you say it's

845.45 --> 853.61
double speak when Riley says the earth

847.16 --> 855.4699999999999
could be a bigger sphere don't you three

853.61 --> 858.47
don't you think that it's kind of like

855.47 --> 862.88
throwing the ballers a nickel because

858.47 --> 867.0500000000001
the actual percent chance of the earth

862.88 --> 870.56
turning out to be a giant ball is very

867.05 --> 880.37
remote considering the absolute missing

870.56 --> 883.55
evidence of curvature right yeah that is

880.37 --> 885.589
also true Riley really doesn't like the

883.55 --> 891.74
stigma because it is like a curse that

885.589 --> 892.339
just that is among almost everyone out

891.74 --> 899.51
there

892.339 --> 902.7700000000001
I don't mind personally like to like I

899.51 --> 907.04
don't mind being called a flat earther

902.77 --> 910.0699999999999
but when I go around it's not like I'm

907.04 --> 915.8299999999999
having a tag with flat earther on it

910.07 --> 917.87
walking around because I don't like only

915.83 --> 921.47
being approached like that and

917.87 --> 924.5600000000001
constantly having the psychological

921.47 --> 929.57
allergic reaction from people which will

924.56 --> 933.17
happen if you do that and look Riley is

929.57 --> 935.9590000000001
all about lawyer' lawyer' speak all

933.17 --> 938.77
about the words and trying to get an

935.959 --> 942.29
entrance trying to get a point without

938.77 --> 946.459
disrupting it it is wizardry with words

942.29 --> 950.0
in a way but I'd like to say in a good

946.459 --> 953.54
way and he wants to avoid that because

950.0 --> 958.339
even in a conversation it's tough even

953.54 --> 961.8499999999999
the word flat earther is technically not

958.339 --> 964.5500000000001
a hundred percent sound because the

961.85 --> 967.4200000000001
earth is not absolutely for their

964.55 --> 972.6999999999999
mountains there's all kinds of things

967.42 --> 972.6999999999999
sea and flat is

972.85 --> 979.78
it's contestable it's simply not a globe

977.45 --> 979.7800000000001
it

980.47 --> 990.23
it's rather level straight oriented it's

985.94 --> 993.4100000000001
about the orientation of well the

990.23 --> 996.64
presumed gravity or relative density

993.41 --> 999.3399999999999
displacement direction the the axis of

996.64 --> 1002.65
the displacement here on the world

999.34 --> 1005.5600000000001
that's what that flat aspect is really

1002.65 --> 1007.6
about to straighten it all out but

1005.56 --> 1009.8199999999999
that's not so obvious when you just say

1007.6 --> 1016.12
Flat Earth to somebody that doesn't know

1009.82 --> 1019.1800000000001
about it and that's problematic it's a

1016.12 --> 1021.66
design problem about the word flat

1019.18 --> 1021.66
earther

1032.03 --> 1041.839
and that is also by the way by pretty

1035.72 --> 1045.3500000000001
early on the word globe skeptic was also

1041.839 --> 1049.089
used as another way to approach it which

1045.35 --> 1049.089
is much more on target

1053.78 --> 1059.75
but yeah the globus themselves are not

1056.96 --> 1063.56
gonna use the word globe skeptic because

1059.75 --> 1067.85
that's just yeah it's a direct assault

1063.56 --> 1071.45
on their on their religious sovereignty

1067.85 --> 1074.1999999999998
or flat earther is totally something

1071.45 --> 1076.46
else so they can talk about that

1074.2 --> 1080.57
attacking lee because it doesn't

1076.46 --> 1085.58
actually really point at them in an init

1080.57 --> 1089.51
in the wording itself they won't like

1085.58 --> 1092.06
globe skeptics at all I don't think that

1089.51 --> 1094.31
Globus will ever call other people globe

1092.06 --> 1099.2
skeptics they will always call them flat

1094.31 --> 1101.4199999999998
earthers because every time they would

1099.2 --> 1104.47
say globe skeptic they would be and

1101.42 --> 1110.17
against their will kind of pointed at

1104.47 --> 1110.17
their belief by the very word saying it

1110.38 --> 1122.5600000000002
all right Nicholas Roberts I got some

1118.58 --> 1125.12
real intellects in chat dropping in I

1122.56 --> 1127.6599999999999
guess the Flat Earth debate trolls wait

1125.12 --> 1127.6599999999999
woke up

1144.87 --> 1149.3999999999999
you have spare room music I didn't know

1148.3 --> 1152.82
that

1149.4 --> 1155.65
well maybe fight the Flat Earth wood

1152.82 --> 1164.35
because I don't think that guy really

1155.65 --> 1166.72
cares truly cares see so that would

1164.35 --> 1172.57
explain he's not a real religious globe

1166.72 --> 1176.1100000000001
or in my opinion that guy's is a total

1172.57 --> 1181.36
complete LARP he he is basically a media

1176.11 --> 1184.32
a media operation a one-man media

1181.36 --> 1184.32
operation he thinks

1191.13 --> 1197.759
as for the other guy you talked about

1194.809 --> 1204.69
team skeptic I I don't know I don't know

1197.759 --> 1207.3890000000001
team skeptic but I guess if you'd have

1204.69 --> 1210.419
skeptic in the in your own name it

1207.389 --> 1216.2099999999998
wouldn't hit you as much anymore to use

1210.419 --> 1221.279
those terminologies so that could also

1216.21 --> 1223.8600000000001
make sense but yeah there may be some

1221.279 --> 1225.36
bloomers out there that use the word

1223.86 --> 1226.32
globe skeptic when describing

1225.36 --> 1230.039
flat-earthers

1226.32 --> 1233.399
but I'd say in general that's a very

1230.039 --> 1236.48
small percentage of clovers and you know

1233.399 --> 1236.4799999999998
it you know that's true

1244.96 --> 1256.54
anyway ah what can I talk about

1251.36 --> 1256.54
yeah there's unfortunately there's some

1256.87 --> 1262.07
work-in-progress next door and they're

1260.21 --> 1264.17
drilling in the walls and everything so

1262.07 --> 1266.57
you may hear some noise we've been lucky

1264.17 --> 1270.0800000000002
enough the first 20 minutes not to hear

1266.57 --> 1272.3
that very glad of it would be extremely

1270.08 --> 1277.79
aggravating if that happened right

1272.3 --> 1279.95
during the intro but yeah it's a little

1277.79 --> 1283.46
off-putting to me breaks my

1279.95 --> 1287.929
concentration because I literally feel

1283.46 --> 1290.559
it just vibrating through me as they do

1287.929 --> 1290.5590000000002
that [ __ ]

1296.69 --> 1305.91
anyway so I think it's been confirmed

1302.73 --> 1308.72
now officially that ranty is also going

1305.91 --> 1312.419
to come to the Amsterdam conference and

1308.72 --> 1319.02
they're on camera and me is p900

1312.419 --> 1326.0700000000002
looking forward to that and I don't know

1319.02 --> 1328.35
I have I hope that's also kind of gonna

1326.07 --> 1330.86
be the end of this issue that's been

1328.35 --> 1330.86
between us

1335.58 --> 1341.48
I hope that that is the move that he's

1338.91 --> 1346.02
making I would really appreciate that

1341.48 --> 1350.13
and if he's genuine about that then you

1346.02 --> 1352.71
know what other people that I in trust

1350.13 --> 1355.2
in a more solid way like Nathan even

1352.71 --> 1358.17
though he's not perfect but I get hidden

1355.2 --> 1361.23
that's the important part I know what to

1358.17 --> 1364.95
expect and that was kind of the problem

1361.23 --> 1367.2
with Randy in certain ways that I there

1364.95 --> 1374.49
were things that I could never tolerate

1367.2 --> 1376.89
i but if that's now over then yeah he

1374.49 --> 1379.59
could even make jokes of me like he

1376.89 --> 1384.47
seems to think is kind of funny you know

1379.59 --> 1390.1399999999999
because I do accept that from my friends

1384.47 --> 1390.14
under certain conditions namely that

1391.16 --> 1398.5700000000002
yeah you don't truly push me and in

1396.36 --> 1401.8799999999999
order for that to do that you really

1398.57 --> 1403.62
gotta get me and to do that you got to

1401.88 --> 1410.4
attune to me and if you can't then

1403.62 --> 1416.4499999999998
there's just a big problem I know I'm

1410.4 --> 1416.45
not the easiest person okay but

1418.09 --> 1426.999
if you don't get me then don't try to

1424.629 --> 1430.599
make friendly jokes about me because

1426.999 --> 1432.8790000000001
that's gonna go wrong it only works when

1430.599 --> 1440.739
you actually get me like Nathan does

1432.879 --> 1442.809
like Riley does so anyway I do

1440.739 --> 1446.559
appreciate it and I really hope this is

1442.809 --> 1450.729
gonna gonna get that new good times are

1446.559 --> 1454.96
gonna come and I really can't wait to

1450.729 --> 1458.349
just try it out you know I even just now

1454.96 --> 1459.219
I'm thinking wow I just be curious - in

1458.349 --> 1463.089
the daytime

1459.219 --> 1466.809
zoom in on clouds certain types of

1463.089 --> 1468.609
clouds look at it very close up what am

1466.809 --> 1472.029
I seeing also chemtrails

1468.609 --> 1479.4399999999998
really seeing what the type of planes

1472.029 --> 1482.44
are that are spraying it all that right

1479.44 --> 1485.589
Resta hat I know I know Randy is off

1482.44 --> 1488.769
course using it - hypothesis own image

1485.589 --> 1492.549
because every move he makes he tries to

1488.769 --> 1496.139
do that that's the part of his gig right

1492.549 --> 1501.339
now it's the part

1496.139 --> 1505.4499999999998
it's his growth plan for his media

1501.339 --> 1512.349
operation which he is engaging in that

1505.45 --> 1514.3590000000002
is what he's doing and he's he's open

1512.349 --> 1516.309
about that I'm pretty sure that if

1514.359 --> 1518.1999999999998
people asked him he'd maybe joke about

1516.309 --> 1520.2
it and then eventually just say yeah

1518.2 --> 1530.13
yeah

1520.2 --> 1533.13
and I accept that I I accept that but

1530.13 --> 1536.13
not without a price of course because if

1533.13 --> 1539.6100000000001
he just said no like like some of my

1536.13 --> 1542.97
friends have just give it to me and

1539.61 --> 1546.299
don't want some kind of spotlight on

1542.97 --> 1548.94
themselves that that makes me extra

1546.299 --> 1550.35
joyous because of the act not

1548.94 --> 1553.799
necessarily because I'm getting

1550.35 --> 1556.769
something does also makes me glad of

1553.799 --> 1560.76
course but the act itself that they

1556.769 --> 1566.97
don't want to just use me as a stepping

1560.76 --> 1568.799
stone to get somewhere and well I'm not

1566.97 --> 1570.419
even saying that Randy is doing that

1568.799 --> 1572.6299999999999
with this but he's kind of trying to

1570.419 --> 1577.0700000000002
make it into a win-win situation and

1572.63 --> 1577.0700000000002
yeah that doesn't give me the same thing

1578.33 --> 1585.51
but I am absolutely happy and it is

1581.25 --> 1588.57
super awesome and it is also cool to get

1585.51 --> 1591.059
the actual camera Randy had because he

1588.57 --> 1595.529
has made some really epic photographs

1591.059 --> 1599.1
with it and I I don't know that I find

1595.529 --> 1603.929
that inspiring as well and I hope that I

1599.1 --> 1606.33
can get something to that level myself

1603.929 --> 1608.72
and show them like hey Randy I can do

1606.33 --> 1608.72
that too

1609.74 --> 1614.8990000000001
because he knows I'm jealous

1613.41 --> 1618.3890000000001
[Music]

1614.899 --> 1626.57
okay Randy you know why I'm jealous of

1618.389 --> 1626.57
you I've been honest about that

1627.35 --> 1630.4499999999998
[Music]

1631.269 --> 1634.269
yeah

1640.229 --> 1643.8890000000001
yeah sure I do

1650.7 --> 1657.57
no Randy I'm not doing that come on

1654.269 --> 1665.179
you did say you had it is kind of a

1657.57 --> 1665.1789999999999
thing right look

1680.7 --> 1683.989
okay rasa

1688.88 --> 1697.8400000000001
no it's just just calm down please

1720.01 --> 1724.09
all right now I didn't handle that well

1723.309 --> 1726.19
at all

1724.09 --> 1730.299
I think that rant II didn't really

1726.19 --> 1732.91
understand what I was saying because I

1730.299 --> 1735.94
hope I was plenty clear that I do

1732.91 --> 1738.669
appreciate it I just said the difference

1735.94 --> 1740.3500000000001
it didn't it's probably it wasn't the

1738.669 --> 1744.7
right time to even bring that up

1740.35 --> 1748.1599999999999
I rest up pulling that [ __ ] out of me

1744.7 --> 1751.3690000000001
again dude

1748.16 --> 1751.3690000000001
[Music]

1759.11 --> 1768.26
okay

1760.32 --> 1772.37
I couldn't tell Resta I don't know just

1768.26 --> 1772.37
try not to piss everyone off

1781.93 --> 1797.25
yeah ask and receive I agree drilling is

1794.559 --> 1797.25
not helping

1800.8 --> 1805.96
[Music]

1820.66 --> 1823.8400000000001
all right

1831.539 --> 1835.32
right I don't know

1853.38 --> 1858.44
that speak your mind once you have the

1856.23 --> 1863.85
camera in your possession

1858.44 --> 1866.13
no because well yes the thing is I

1863.85 --> 1872.039
always speak my mind or I bite my tongue

1866.13 --> 1876.2
and just don't talk but look it once all

1872.039 --> 1879.33
that happens I will see what it means

1876.2 --> 1881.57
from Randy you know meeting him face to

1879.33 --> 1881.57
face

1889.96 --> 1898.99
yeah must hire salim that's exactly what

1895.21 --> 1901.809
i'm trying to think of because i never

1898.99 --> 1906.1
wanted this issue between me and randy

1901.809 --> 1908.4089999999999
that built up over the years it's

1906.1 --> 1911.009
actually been quite torturous to me and

1908.409 --> 1917.679
i've been open to that to the others

1911.009 --> 1921.69
then even on this hangout and the idea

1917.679 --> 1926.74
that that could be over now completely

1921.69 --> 1931.48
by this gesture from randy is does make

1926.74 --> 1940.539
me happy it does bring some relief as it

1931.48 --> 1942.669
were in the tension but i don't know if

1940.539 --> 1945.49
that is really what its gonna turn out

1942.669 --> 1947.1390000000001
to be I'm I'm just very skeptic because

1945.49 --> 1955.99
there's been again a lot of issues

1947.139 --> 1958.869
between me and Randy and just trust

1955.99 --> 1964.36
issues to with minor things by the way

1958.869 --> 1966.6689999999999
and I just don't know but I'm at this

1964.36 --> 1971.559
moment I'm presuming that it is exactly

1966.669 --> 1975.909
as portrayed to be just a peace gesture

1971.559 --> 1978.759
as it were and I'm already engaging him

1975.909 --> 1981.6290000000001
you know I'm on the show again just

1978.759 --> 1981.629
carefully

1984.25 --> 1988.12
and we'll see where it goes

1991.879 --> 1994.539
Wow

2014.58 --> 2017.58
right

2020.66 --> 2023.6200000000001
mm-hmm

2042.56 --> 2053.34
professor Bell you mean on Randy show

2045.65 --> 2057.9
Ragnar Stephanie listen I did that first

2053.34 --> 2064.83
hour was just an was just amazing it's

2057.9 --> 2068.55
crazy that it took him an hour that was

2064.83 --> 2076.5
absolutely stunning it took him an hour

2068.55 --> 2078.48
to say very little and very slowly and I

2076.5 --> 2081.74
was pretty surprised even that reality

2078.48 --> 2084.72
did let it go as far as long as it did

2081.74 --> 2088.14
because people in chat were literally

2084.72 --> 2090.6
just half laughing Lee but also

2088.14 --> 2094.71
seriously just saying like ah just kick

2090.6 --> 2101.79
him already get Riley in there this

2094.71 --> 2104.9700000000003
we're going insane from boredom and that

2101.79 --> 2107.25
was kind of funny about it as for what

2104.97 --> 2111.54
he was presenting it was so watered-down

2107.25 --> 2114.33
nonsense pseudoscience a very low tier

2111.54 --> 2118.2
it was just baffling that he could feel

2114.33 --> 2122.46
an hour with that level of nonsense it

2118.2 --> 2129.96
was really amazing spectacular in a odd

2122.46 --> 2133.44
way yeah yeah I did listen to what he

2129.96 --> 2137.0
said and it was [ __ ] most of it was

2133.44 --> 2137.0
absolute trash

2138.74 --> 2147.5099999999998
come on his his scientific definition

2143.63 --> 2149.57
the things he said about that was so

2147.51 --> 2154.3500000000004
ridiculous

2149.57 --> 2156.0800000000004
science is not about truth

2154.35 --> 2160.5499999999997
[Music]

2156.08 --> 2164.54
that's one of the most [ __ ] things

2160.55 --> 2168.76
I've ever heard in that field it's

2164.54 --> 2171.2599999999998
really that it's so dumb it's beyond

2168.76 --> 2176.8100000000004
science doesn't prove anything which is

2171.26 --> 2180.11
also really stupid but at least with a

2176.81 --> 2182.75
small explanation that kind of makes

2180.11 --> 2186.2000000000003
sense that it not exactly what means

2182.75 --> 2188.72
what you first think it would mean well

2186.2 --> 2192.56
when you say science is not about truth

2188.72 --> 2201.5899999999997
there is just no way to misinterpret

2192.56 --> 2209.36
that it's so [ __ ] unbelievable yeah

2201.59 --> 2215.2000000000003
too bad Marceline no my what is it it's

2209.36 --> 2215.2000000000003
like that was the imbecile face as well

2215.59 --> 2221.09
people that are so dumb that they just

2218.81 --> 2223.7799999999997
spare them all day and can't even think

2221.09 --> 2227.01
or speak

2223.78 --> 2227.01
[Music]

2228.799 --> 2235.199
yeah my thoughts exactly proficient

2232.079 --> 2237.779
pirate if that guy's a professor his

2235.199 --> 2239.299
students are screwed they're screwed

2237.779 --> 2241.619
because either they know he is

2239.299 --> 2244.049
completely full of [ __ ] and they had to

2241.619 --> 2248.969
sit through it and just entertain this

2244.049 --> 2250.559
buffoon and get by or they'll be screwed

2248.969 --> 2253.619
because they're actually too dumb to

2250.559 --> 2257.13
recognize that he is a buffoon and will

2253.619 --> 2259.2290000000003
take on his stupidity as they go it's

2257.13 --> 2261.469
got to be a lose-lose situation either

2259.229 --> 2261.4689999999996
way

2271.87 --> 2278.13
get out of here I reckon there's

2273.58 --> 2278.13
stephanotis and get out here

2287.75 --> 2296.29
and pulled our satellites and I'm making

2293.29 --> 2296.29
yeah

2304.65 --> 2311.659
[Music]

2351.72 --> 2360.98
Oh God freakin drill wasn't here

2373.21 --> 2386.79
uh reckoner I'm really starting to get

2383.89 --> 2386.79
sick a few man

2391.08 --> 2397.11
half a year ago I thought you really

2393.39 --> 2400.62
were kind of a valued commenter but you

2397.11 --> 2405.1800000000003
seem to degrade into really baller trash

2400.62 --> 2407.73
levels of remarks and ideas and you're

2405.18 --> 2413.85
literally trying to manipulate me away

2407.73 --> 2417.39
from my honest opinions it's kind of

2413.85 --> 2419.73
disgusting if you're really gonna tell

2417.39 --> 2424.2599999999998
me like how dare you criticize this

2419.73 --> 2426.48
teacher when you are not a teacher if

2424.26 --> 2430.53
I'm gonna criticize you as a goldsmith

2426.48 --> 2436.35
when I'm not a goldsmith is that okay it

2430.53 --> 2438.3
is disgusting we know this stuff we've

2436.35 --> 2439.49
all studied it we've all talked about it

2438.3 --> 2444.21
for years

2439.49 --> 2448.1099999999997
this guy was a [ __ ] clown he didn't

2444.21 --> 2451.58
know [ __ ] first-tier arguments Ragnar

2448.11 --> 2454.26
Steffen Alderson completely loose

2451.58 --> 2458.5699999999997
foundation no proper application of

2454.26 --> 2461.13
words ridiculous ethereal claims

2458.57 --> 2465.7400000000002
foundational structures based not on

2461.13 --> 2472.62
scientifically proven facts and/or

2465.74 --> 2475.02
confusion that [ __ ] now that was not him

2472.62 --> 2476.19
but it's what it's gonna lead to you

2475.02 --> 2479.4
know it's gonna happen

2476.19 --> 2481.62
it's gonna get in contacted rumpus and

2479.4 --> 2483.21
all these [ __ ] idiots and then he's

2481.62 --> 2490.77
just gonna be another cookie cutter

2483.21 --> 2492.12
clone of them it's not an honest

2490.77 --> 2494.48
question wrecking their staff and how

2492.12 --> 2494.48
their sin

2523.68 --> 2530.79
all right that's a good one Mazhar salim

2527.73 --> 2532.77
if gas is constantly being produced at

2530.79 --> 2537.63
ground level how does that explain a

2532.77 --> 2540.87
constant pressure of 14.7 PSI well I

2537.63 --> 2544.56
don't know exactly but I can definitely

2540.87 --> 2548.16
do use a proper answer to that okay in

2544.56 --> 2551.75
order for materials to transit into

2548.16 --> 2555.0899999999997
another form okay there are usually

2551.75 --> 2557.46
pressure boundaries in order for those

2555.09 --> 2561.81
types of processes in order to come into

2557.46 --> 2565.56
being say water evaporating without

2561.81 --> 2567.23
boiling requires a certain threshold of

2565.56 --> 2575.43
pressure opposing it

2567.23 --> 2578.61
so maybe 14.7 PSI is the threshold for

2575.43 --> 2580.71
gas to start pumping out and as soon as

2578.61 --> 2582.9300000000003
it decreases the gas starts pumping out

2580.71 --> 2587.78
and that is why it remains at that

2582.93 --> 2590.43
constant that would be a logical seeming

2587.78 --> 2594.0800000000004
structural explanation as to why it

2590.43 --> 2594.08
remains at that constant

2601.23 --> 2606.9
and if it would exceed it slightly well

2604.08 --> 2610.3199999999997
maybe that will just halt the amount of

2606.9 --> 2614.19
gas evaporation happening that would

2610.32 --> 2614.88
make sense so I hope that answers your

2614.19 --> 2618.0
question

2614.88 --> 2620.4900000000002
not that I literally know it but I can

2618.0 --> 2624.71
definitely conceive of the explanation

2620.49 --> 2624.7099999999996
for it based on what I already know

2631.99 --> 2637.5699999999997
yeah siga yeah get out of here

2645.859 --> 2654.5989999999997
if your if you literally are mentally to

2649.47 --> 2663.27
that level you're not welcome here okay

2654.599 --> 2665.7000000000003
I don't accept [ __ ] people unless

2663.27 --> 2667.799
they realize they're [ __ ] and they

2665.7 --> 2674.819
will keep their retardation to

2667.799 --> 2677.96
themselves which luckily some people

2674.819 --> 2677.96
here know by now

2686.51 --> 2689.639
[Music]

2696.959 --> 2704.1989999999996
well Mazhar Salim

2699.94 --> 2706.69
I can probably scientifically prove my

2704.199 --> 2710.829
case concerning the water evaporation

2706.69 --> 2715.9
the general transit of materials in non

2710.829 --> 2717.88
gaseous state to gaseous state that that

2715.9 --> 2721.469
required that it has a pressure

2717.88 --> 2724.2690000000002
threshold I could absolutely prove that

2721.469 --> 2726.549
with science all that independent

2724.269 --> 2728.979
variable dependent variable condition

2726.549 --> 2734.68
boundary bubbles are all that yeah I can

2728.979 --> 2739.5589999999997
do that oh yeah so that would simply

2734.68 --> 2743.319
provide a scientific basis to explain

2739.559 --> 2745.1800000000003
something that is very wide and not so

2743.319 --> 2747.219
easily proven yeah you would have to

2745.18 --> 2748.66
statistically measure it everywhere what

2747.219 --> 2753.849
happens with the pressure fluctuations

2748.66 --> 2755.859
and how would you even measure exactly

2753.849 --> 2758.1090000000004
where the gases are produced are you

2755.859 --> 2760.8089999999997
gonna have to have like scatters on

2758.109 --> 2763.69
trees and [ __ ] this seems almost

2760.809 --> 2766.119
impossible to get that scientifically

2763.69 --> 2769.049
proven but that leaves it at least it

2766.119 --> 2775.6600000000003
would give a scientific foundation as to

2769.049 --> 2780.119
explaining why pressure would despite

2775.66 --> 2782.709
being a gas pressure despite gas being

2780.119 --> 2785.099
put out why it remains relatively

2782.709 --> 2785.0989999999997
constant

2797.66 --> 2802.22
that's a really dumb gaslighting

2801.559 --> 2805.549
question

2802.22 --> 2809.0
mercury m7 you can't lure me into

2805.549 --> 2812.329
solipsistic nonsense just because that's

2809.0 --> 2814.369
where you dwell wants you even for a

2812.329 --> 2817.9100000000003
second presupposition they entertain

2814.369 --> 2821.119
that your ball [ __ ] is wrong right yeah

2817.91 --> 2824.029
you you dive into solipsism that's where

2821.119 --> 2825.65
you go when you start to entertain that

2824.029 --> 2830.269
you may be wrong that's right

2825.65 --> 2834.819
we're not there that's you mercury m7

2830.269 --> 2834.819
not me not flat earthers

2840.61 --> 2843.84
[Music]

2865.91 --> 2873.68
ah the ultimate rebuttal look at that

2870.41 --> 2882.44
the ultimate rebuttal it's where it all

2873.68 --> 2884.9199999999996
ends the final answer nope we've been

2882.44 --> 2887.78
hearing that a lot lately haven't we

2884.92 --> 2890.39
especially on the debates they get

2887.78 --> 2892.88
crushed until the last last moment and

2890.39 --> 2896.33
they even their jittering won't spur

2892.88 --> 2899.1400000000003
forth anymore - rumpus just ends with

2896.33 --> 2899.14
nope

2899.62 --> 2903.2599999999998
aren't you gonna give an answer to the

2902.75 --> 2908.17
question

2903.26 --> 2909.98
no don't you agree with this

2908.17 --> 2913.07
scientifically found it

2909.98 --> 2916.31
reasoning structure with the natural

2913.07 --> 2920.23
laws no it's the ultimate baller answer

2916.31 --> 2920.23
the final answer no

2925.01 --> 2929.69
it's just like I know four year old

2927.65 --> 2932.96
three year old when they really figure

2929.69 --> 2934.339
out the power of the word know when

2932.96 --> 2936.32
they're all stripped away of their

2934.339 --> 2939.099
religious comfort that has prevented

2936.32 --> 2941.4500000000003
them from actually growing up

2939.099 --> 2944.15
intellectually and getting insight on

2941.45 --> 2946.25
what is real what is not when that's all

2944.15 --> 2949.31
taken away they fall back to where it

2946.25 --> 2951.859
really started the mind set and then

2949.31 --> 2955.16
they remember the power of the word no

2951.859 --> 2959.65
you can just make everything go away by

2955.16 --> 2959.6499999999996
saying no hmm

2978.94 --> 2982.77
and their necklace is just a troll

2988.77 --> 2996.58
and I think that Ragnar Stefan hawlucha

2991.51 --> 3000.0
may also be just a troll and he has

2996.58 --> 3002.85
proceeded to move from beyond getting

3000.0 --> 3004.44
banned because of bad behavior in which

3002.85 --> 3008.5699999999997
he would have had the opportunity to

3004.44 --> 3008.57
probably be unbanned at some point

3008.63 --> 3013.32
basically giving him for a long time it

3011.49 --> 3016.109
and he is now proceeded to make Sauk

3013.32 --> 3019.4100000000003
accounts so it seems where God not gonna

3016.109 --> 3021.63
be actually having conversations with

3019.41 --> 3027.35
Ragnar Stefan audition for the coming

3021.63 --> 3027.35
month at least it's very sad

3048.66 --> 3052.71
nah not really

3060.18 --> 3069.48
I don't think we'll be missing another

3063.38 --> 3072.119
baller troll just you know we got enough

3069.48 --> 3076.4
goblins hobbling around on the internet

3072.119 --> 3082.83
already will not be missing another one

3076.4 --> 3086.1600000000003
you know once they they drop the human

3082.83 --> 3089.97
robes and reveal what they really have

3086.16 --> 3090.2999999999997
become yeah at that point not be missing

3089.97 --> 3092.8199999999997
that

3090.3 --> 3096.78
yeah the cloak that cloak there was a

3092.82 --> 3100.7000000000003
nice idea but it's not real and what it

3096.78 --> 3100.7000000000003
is shall not be missed

3122.6 --> 3129.2599999999998
well Jason of the history family just

3125.48 --> 3133.37
went live the next part of their tour

3129.26 --> 3133.82
that's cool I'm gonna run out to show by

3133.37 --> 3136.85
the way

3133.82 --> 3139.52
but I'll I'll link that up for a moment

3136.85 --> 3142.87
for those that are interested in light

3139.52 --> 3142.87
alive street activism

3148.72 --> 3156.2799999999997
yeah it's life it just

3158.71 --> 3164.4900000000002
I'm not putting out the sound but anyway

3160.99 --> 3167.5
dude you had take a look if you like

3164.49 --> 3171.2099999999996
yeah seems to have a little bit of a

3167.5 --> 3173.71
connection problem here and there but

3171.21 --> 3179.67
anyway the Flat Earth debates are also

3173.71 --> 3179.67
up and running and I am gonna join that

3184.86 --> 3192.1800000000003
now mercury m7 you do troll me but

3192.48 --> 3201.4
you're not out of control let's just say

3197.41 --> 3203.73
it like that you know you're not out of

3201.4 --> 3203.73
control

3204.0 --> 3215.8
you're just a troll a control is those

3210.43 --> 3223.2999999999997
are the worst the out of control

3215.8 --> 3225.13
trolls anyway to many puns thanks

3223.3 --> 3226.75
everyone for coming if you like to show

3225.13 --> 3229.1800000000003
them please don't forget to upload it

3226.75 --> 3230.68

that would be much appreciated please

3243.25 --> 3256.45
don't forget to do that

3244.75 --> 3259.68
Samhain where are you damn yeah but well

3256.45 --> 3259.68
it is what it is

3262.47 --> 3267.8689999999997
right I'll be back tomorrow as flat

3264.93 --> 3269.5789999999997
earth early-bird number 302 and I'm

3267.869 --> 3270.3900000000003
gonna join the Flat Earth debates right

3269.579 --> 3277.26
after this

3270.39 --> 3281.569
hashtag meifa indeed over moco so until

3277.26 --> 3281.5690000000004
the next time keep it flat

3282.18 --> 3312.2599999999998
