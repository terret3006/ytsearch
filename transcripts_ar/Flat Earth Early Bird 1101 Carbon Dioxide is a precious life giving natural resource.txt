after this that's awesome

124.079 --> 129.51999999999998
really did work out

126.399 --> 132.8
but yeah that's just gonna last me

129.52 --> 133.68
up until tomorrow pretty much

132.8 --> 135.84
so

133.68 --> 137.59900000000002
any more donations would be greatly

135.84 --> 139.68
appreciated

137.599 --> 142.79999999999998
anyway the weather today is

139.68 --> 145.68
yeah it's not a gray soup

142.8 --> 147.76000000000002
but it is kind of cloudy

145.68 --> 149.20000000000002
and a little bit of blue spots in

147.76 --> 151.28
between i just

149.2 --> 153.2
i caught a ray of sunshine like 15

151.28 --> 155.76
minutes ago but

153.2 --> 159.11999999999998
didn't last very long

155.76 --> 162.959
but the sun is out there

159.12 --> 164.56
somewhere behind there behind the clouds

162.959 --> 166.16
right

164.56 --> 167.44
at least it doesn't seem to be a very

166.16 --> 170.44
moist

167.44 --> 170.44
day

173.28 --> 176.879
all right

174.64 --> 176.879
so

182.56 --> 185.56
ah

187.2 --> 191.2
hello clutch first in chat good to see

189.519 --> 194.08
you

191.2 --> 194.07999999999998
how are you doing

194.879 --> 199.35999999999999
i think i'm doing a bit better than

196.72 --> 202.319
yesterday

199.36 --> 202.31900000000002
but yeah still

202.64 --> 206.64
slight issues

204.48 --> 209.84
i don't know but i don't feel like i'm

206.64 --> 213.83999999999997
gonna go be going back and forth a lot

209.84 --> 213.84
in the first half hour unlike yesterday

217.76 --> 223.12
right but yeah the

220.64 --> 225.76
magnesium side trade did definitely help

223.12 --> 227.519
last time so i i thought let me start

225.76 --> 230.56
out with that

227.519 --> 233.56
and it seems to be doing the trick

230.56 --> 233.56
hmm

242.4 --> 246.799
i hope my stomach is doing well it i

244.72 --> 249.35999999999999
don't think that my stomach directly is

246.799 --> 249.36
the problem

252.959 --> 258.959
it's a lit it's a bit lower than that

256.72 --> 262.8
right my stomach would be the problem if

258.959 --> 266.16
i had like hyper nervousness or

262.8 --> 269.12
like i did saturday that's my stomach

266.16 --> 272.08000000000004
among other things but in this case it's

269.12 --> 272.08
it's not really that

272.8 --> 276.72
but yeah it's all still recovering and

275.28 --> 278.88
i don't know how long this is going to

276.72 --> 283.6
take all together but

278.88 --> 284.71999999999997
it's getting better anyway um

283.6 --> 289.12
yeah

284.72 --> 289.12
yesterday's flat earth debate was good

293.919 --> 296.919
uh

297.919 --> 302.32
and even my own show yesterday was

300.08 --> 304.56
pretty good

302.32 --> 307.44
once i got going

304.56 --> 308.84
as interesting subjects like the history

307.44 --> 311.12
of

308.84 --> 315.19899999999996
development something that i

311.12 --> 315.199
particularly like analyzing

315.52 --> 320.88
like how did the computers develop how

317.52 --> 325.28
do the programmers develop etc

320.88 --> 326.96
and the culture and the mindset

325.28 --> 331.039
anyway

326.96 --> 331.039
hello service day good to see you

332.24 --> 335.919
i also got some mint tea

341.6 --> 345.12
how's my sound coming through

345.52 --> 348.08
seemed to be

348.16 --> 353.72
a lot of background noise in this for

350.4 --> 353.71999999999997
some reason

355.44 --> 359.479
i don't know what's going on

372.0 --> 375.68
we're really enjoying big bears shows

374.319 --> 377.6
last few days

375.68 --> 379.68
well i

377.6 --> 381.03900000000004
i hadn't really watched it like

379.68 --> 384.0
yesterday

381.039 --> 386.08
but today this morning i

384.0 --> 387.28
did take a look again over at bitchute

386.08 --> 388.56
and yeah

387.28 --> 390.4
watched

388.56 --> 391.52
yesterday's show

390.4 --> 394.15999999999997
and

391.52 --> 396.4
started like mondays

394.16 --> 399.199
yesterdays was kind of short

396.4 --> 399.19899999999996
but mondays

399.44 --> 404.4
was a bit longer but yeah it only got

401.6 --> 406.88
into 20 minutes of that

404.4 --> 410.71999999999997
but yeah owen benjamin has been

406.88 --> 410.71999999999997
doing really great for a while now

411.12 --> 415.639
so

412.24 --> 415.639
it's all great

422.479 --> 425.479
ah

444.56 --> 451.12
hello stop trafficking my rasta hat

448.16 --> 454.24
no doppler radar of deadly tornadoes

451.12 --> 454.24
nope okay

457.52 --> 460.56
right

458.4 --> 464.84
so yeah yesterday i think it was gadget

460.56 --> 464.84
inspector showed me this video

464.96 --> 469.599
of awake souls about david weiss

468.24 --> 470.639
and

469.599 --> 473.44
well

470.639 --> 475.759
it was exactly as bad as i suspected it

473.44 --> 480.0
would be

475.759 --> 484.24
as in total out of proportion [ __ ]

480.0 --> 484.24
but it is it is a bit weird though

484.56 --> 487.84
but

485.28 --> 489.28
has anybody even like asked david about

487.84 --> 492.31899999999996
it

489.28 --> 494.15999999999997
that he was apparently live on air i

492.319 --> 496.16
don't even know if he knew about it when

494.16 --> 499.199
he came on there it was sort of

496.16 --> 502.08000000000004
initiated into this

499.199 --> 502.08
brotherhood

502.16 --> 504.40000000000003
but

504.84 --> 509.039
like

506.4 --> 509.039
i yeah

509.36 --> 513.36
i don't even know like how serious he

511.599 --> 515.76
he's taking that

513.36 --> 518.159
like is he admitting that is he saying

515.76 --> 519.12
like yeah but can't talk about it or

518.159 --> 521.8389999999999
like

519.12 --> 521.839
anything

528.0 --> 531.519
yeah because

529.36 --> 534.16
if that it did happen

531.519 --> 537.36
but it is a bit weird but yeah how scary

534.16 --> 540.64
should we take that i mean

537.36 --> 540.64
it's like an invite

542.72 --> 547.12
i don't know

544.24 --> 549.6800000000001
but yeah awake souls just blew it

547.12 --> 551.68
completely out of proportion

549.68 --> 554.0
i think in the video like made it all

551.68 --> 555.12
spooky

554.0 --> 559.56
uh

555.12 --> 559.5600000000001
kind of pointless if you ask me

566.88 --> 570.68
okay rest ahead

578.88 --> 583.8
hey psychics traveler good to see you

619.68 --> 622.68
um

639.12 --> 644.8
right so yeah i didn't really have any

641.04 --> 647.8
specific subjects in mind today

644.8 --> 647.8
uh

650.32 --> 655.6
i watched i think what is the the last

652.88 --> 658.72
jason bourne movie yesterday

655.6 --> 660.8000000000001
like that's like the side story

658.72 --> 663.2
i thought it was like a recast but it

660.8 --> 666.0
wasn't it was actually a side story to

663.2 --> 668.0790000000001
the original movies

666.0 --> 671.56
and yeah it was

668.079 --> 671.56
it wasn't bad

674.32 --> 677.6800000000001
that's it

675.36 --> 677.6800000000001
right

680.64 --> 685.8389999999999
i think that the movie format does have

683.44 --> 688.1600000000001
it does have a very good concept

685.839 --> 691.0400000000001
and it's like a great excuse to really

688.16 --> 694.7199999999999
just open a can of like

691.04 --> 694.7199999999999
like over-the-top action

699.04 --> 703.279
which does typically happen in these

700.88 --> 705.92
movies like the action is completely

703.279 --> 705.92
overkill

706.72 --> 709.44
but yeah

710.56 --> 713.5189999999999
a lot of people probably appreciate it

712.48 --> 715.44
for that

713.519 --> 717.92
anyway

715.44 --> 720.48
uh that happened and

717.92 --> 720.4799999999999
let's see

721.36 --> 724.72
what kind of streams we're on

728.56 --> 732.959
oh yeah of course kiwi live

730.959 --> 734.88
was there i wasn't on the panel but i

732.959 --> 737.5189999999999
stayed in chat

734.88 --> 739.519
it was interesting

737.519 --> 741.12
once the food talk

739.519 --> 745.5600000000001
was finally over

741.12 --> 745.5600000000001
which is like half the show usually

750.88 --> 757.04
mitchell from australia

752.88 --> 761.959
it's another great drone session

757.04 --> 761.959
he's really using that drone of his

771.519 --> 773.839
uh

774.079 --> 777.68
right that was pretty much it

780.48 --> 782.72
uh

783.839 --> 786.9200000000001
all right

793.6 --> 799.16
logical conclusion

796.16 --> 799.16
hello

802.399 --> 805.399
huh

821.199 --> 824.199
hmm

828.24 --> 830.8
right

829.12 --> 833.04
that's interesting that you say that

830.8 --> 836.4799999999999
psychics traveler i have actually been

833.04 --> 838.88
thinking about that for a bit ever since

836.48 --> 842.88
uh awake souls

838.88 --> 846.72
like on uh jaren's

842.88 --> 846.72
like demonstrated his

847.36 --> 855.12
well hit his 3d representation of like

850.72 --> 858.1600000000001
the field of view with the celestials

855.12 --> 860.72
and yeah i've been thinking about that

858.16 --> 862.24
it is all at the edge of vision stars

860.72 --> 866.24
and moon and sun

862.24 --> 868.9590000000001
but yet depending on the conditions

866.24 --> 868.9590000000001
of the weather

869.44 --> 875.6
they might end up

871.92 --> 879.12
seemingly closer or farther away

875.6 --> 879.12
depending on the circumstances

882.88 --> 887.6
but yeah i i i'm gonna have to like pay

885.6 --> 892.0
more attention

887.6 --> 892.0
with that concept in mind to to see like

892.16 --> 897.68
does that happen a lot does it really

894.88 --> 899.76
apparently vary in its apparent distance

897.68 --> 901.68
depending on the weather a lot or is it

899.76 --> 902.48
just

901.68 --> 904.959
just

902.48 --> 907.9590000000001
minor deviations

904.959 --> 907.959
right

954.959 --> 959.199
okay i don't know what that means sorry

956.56 --> 961.1199999999999
traveler anyway yeah

959.199 --> 965.7199999999999
be back in two minutes

961.12 --> 965.72
hey slow mo moon buggy good to see you

987.519 --> 990.519
so

1092.84 --> 1096.9189999999999
you uh

1128.12 --> 1135.039
scientific observation what

1132.48 --> 1135.039
no that's

1135.12 --> 1138.32
that's colloquialist

1147.039 --> 1151.84
also the scientific method doesn't

1148.72 --> 1151.84
really require math

1152.72 --> 1155.84
like it

1154.48 --> 1156.559
is built

1155.84 --> 1158.32
with

1156.559 --> 1160.3999999999999
descriptions

1158.32 --> 1162.3999999999999
so you don't need to

1160.4 --> 1164.24
apply math at all with the scientific

1162.4 --> 1166.4
method

1164.24 --> 1168.72
you wouldn't even have to understand

1166.4 --> 1168.72
math

1171.6 --> 1176.36
and you could still use the scientific

1173.36 --> 1176.36
method

1211.28 --> 1214.28
uh

1231.039 --> 1235.2
all right yes slow mo moonboogie where

1232.799 --> 1236.96
are you are you like on the east coast

1235.2 --> 1238.159
of the us or

1236.96 --> 1240.48
england

1238.159 --> 1244.2800000000002
no it should not be england the sun's

1240.48 --> 1244.28
already way up there

1260.48 --> 1263.48
hey

1279.6 --> 1284.6399999999999
huh

1280.96 --> 1286.72
what is the temperature here anyway

1284.64 --> 1291.0800000000002
i think it's been like dangling around

1286.72 --> 1291.08
to six degrees or something

1293.039 --> 1298.36
oh no wait it's 11 right now hmm

1304.159 --> 1309.5200000000002
to the google predictions it's gonna be

1306.0 --> 1311.6
like going down and by next tuesday it's

1309.52 --> 1314.08
gonna be four degrees

1311.6 --> 1314.08
all right

1317.28 --> 1319.84
whatever

1321.12 --> 1325.4799999999998
the land of skull and bones

1339.6 --> 1342.6
what

1351.679 --> 1356.799
okay so rash that do it i take it

1354.0 --> 1359.799
there's like this big tornado that

1356.799 --> 1359.799
hit

1360.24 --> 1364.48
in the u.s

1362.24 --> 1364.48
right

1369.2 --> 1374.0800000000002
in the freezing weather that is a bit

1371.12 --> 1377.28
odd

1374.08 --> 1377.28
an iced tomato

1378.64 --> 1383.159
i've never heard of that before actually

1392.48 --> 1398.08
yale campus right okay well i

1395.039 --> 1400.48
slow mo moon buggy sorry

1398.08 --> 1403.4399999999998
i know a lot about america geography by

1400.48 --> 1407.76
now but i don't know where yale actually

1403.44 --> 1407.76
is in america i know it's in america

1414.72 --> 1420.559
i mean i can

1416.559 --> 1423.52
sort of i like by reference know roughly

1420.559 --> 1425.84
where states are when you name them

1423.52 --> 1427.12
cities that's another matter

1425.84 --> 1431.72
it's like

1427.12 --> 1431.7199999999998
i only know very few

1432.159 --> 1436.24
hot air to make tornadoes

1439.44 --> 1443.52
yeah it that it is

1441.44 --> 1446.0800000000002
weird isn't it

1443.52 --> 1447.9189999999999
normally it yeah it's like the meeting

1446.08 --> 1451.6789999999999
of two

1447.919 --> 1454.159
radically different temperature fronts

1451.679 --> 1457.2
but on the other hand

1454.159 --> 1459.7600000000002
even if things are very cold on land you

1457.2 --> 1464.24
have to think about this

1459.76 --> 1464.24
the ocean is often warmer

1464.559 --> 1468.32
right

1465.44 --> 1468.3200000000002
during the winter

1470.64 --> 1473.8400000000001
so

1471.44 --> 1475.76
if there is any warmth

1473.84 --> 1478.72
that could have fed the tornado it would

1475.76 --> 1480.64
have come from the ocean

1478.72 --> 1485.159
because that's the only natural place

1480.64 --> 1485.159
where it would be slightly warmer

1487.44 --> 1492.0800000000002
but still yeah i've never heard of like

1489.52 --> 1495.4
a tornado during snowstorms i've never

1492.08 --> 1495.3999999999999
heard of that

1525.12 --> 1530.4799999999998
it wasn't near the ocean really so it

1528.159 --> 1533.44
didn't

1530.48 --> 1534.72
form at the ocean

1533.44 --> 1536.559
it just

1534.72 --> 1539.2
suddenly touched down in the middle of

1536.559 --> 1543.3999999999999
land is that is that what you're saying

1539.2 --> 1543.4
because that is really bizarre

1575.36 --> 1579.52
right

1577.039 --> 1580.64
okay hey rest that you don't need to go

1579.52 --> 1584.0
caps

1580.64 --> 1588.0
don't need to do that

1584.0 --> 1588.0
don't go full agm on me now

1593.279 --> 1598.0
right so it is weird

1595.919 --> 1600.24
but yeah i don't i would have to like

1598.0 --> 1602.64
see like the

1600.24 --> 1603.84
well it's for starter the temperature

1602.64 --> 1606.5590000000002
map

1603.84 --> 1609.1999999999998
during the time when that happened

1606.559 --> 1611.6789999999999
because if there was

1609.2 --> 1613.919
big differences in temperature from land

1611.679 --> 1616.72
inwards to the coast

1613.919 --> 1620.159
then potentially it could have kind of

1616.72 --> 1621.76
like bumped at some point

1620.159 --> 1624.48
hypothetically

1621.76 --> 1627.039
thinking of meteorology right

1624.48 --> 1630.24
so

1627.039 --> 1633.12
just because something is unusual

1630.24 --> 1634.64
doesn't mean that it that it has to be

1633.12 --> 1637.279
man-made

1634.64 --> 1639.44
you got to figure it out carefully and

1637.279 --> 1641.919
see if something like

1639.44 --> 1644.88
blatantly unnatural is happening and

1641.919 --> 1646.0800000000002
just some an unusual weather phenom

1644.88 --> 1648.3990000000001
event

1646.08 --> 1650.799
does not automatically

1648.399 --> 1653.039
mean that it means

1650.799 --> 1655.12
like

1653.039 --> 1658.08
well weather maps

1655.12 --> 1660.399
charts like was there like something

1658.08 --> 1663.12
that never happens

1660.399 --> 1666.0
like suddenly a pocket of warm air kept

1663.12 --> 1668.6399999999999
warm and it suddenly rammed itself land

1666.0 --> 1670.88
inward for example

1668.64 --> 1673.5200000000002
in a way that never naturally happens

1670.88 --> 1675.5200000000002
right that would be an indication of

1673.52 --> 1677.2
actual weather manipulation to lead to

1675.52 --> 1679.12
such an event

1677.2 --> 1681.8400000000001
you got to be careful

1679.12 --> 1684.0
in jumping to conclusions just because

1681.84 --> 1686.6399999999999
something is completely

1684.0 --> 1689.36
abnormal a weather event that it

1686.64 --> 1692.72
automatically means it's man-made right

1689.36 --> 1692.7199999999998
unless of course like

1693.84 --> 1697.4399999999998
the day before or somewhere in the day

1696.24 --> 1698.96
before

1697.44 --> 1702.3200000000002
there was another

1698.96 --> 1704.159
weird holographic like rainbow light

1702.32 --> 1706.08
spectacle thing happening which is

1704.159 --> 1707.0390000000002
typically like a side effect of when

1706.08 --> 1709.4399999999998
harp

1707.039 --> 1711.6
type systems are

1709.44 --> 1714.0800000000002
applied

1711.6 --> 1716.48
which is a blatant weather manipulation

1714.08 --> 1719.039
system right that's a sign

1716.48 --> 1720.159
did that happen at all or not at all

1719.039 --> 1722.559
right

1720.159 --> 1725.44
you got to look for the signs to really

1722.559 --> 1728.8799999999999
know what happened because it is the

1725.44 --> 1731.3600000000001
united states and weird weather [ __ ]

1728.88 --> 1733.7600000000002
even without manipulation happens in the

1731.36 --> 1737.039
united states

1733.76 --> 1741.039
sudden unexpected turns in in weather

1737.039 --> 1743.12
behavior happens in the united states

1741.039 --> 1744.0
that's not just oh that's this year no

1743.12 --> 1746.08
that's

1744.0 --> 1748.799
as far as i can remember

1746.08 --> 1750.96
weird unexpected weather events

1748.799 --> 1752.799
typically happen in the united states

1750.96 --> 1754.64
much more than any other region in the

1752.799 --> 1757.679
world

1754.64 --> 1759.8400000000001
so you got to look for the signs

1757.679 --> 1762.72
read the charts

1759.84 --> 1765.36
and then see is this just one of these

1762.72 --> 1766.48
weird american unusual weather events or

1765.36 --> 1770.0
was there

1766.48 --> 1770.0
man-made intervention

1771.919 --> 1776.0
you gotta figure it out before you jump

1774.0 --> 1777.279
to conclusions

1776.0 --> 1781.84
or you're just gonna look like a

1777.279 --> 1781.84
conspirator you don't want that

1783.2 --> 1789.2
yeah well rasta just saying this is not

1785.52 --> 1789.2
possible doesn't prove anything

1789.44 --> 1792.44
right

1798.399 --> 1803.8799999999999
hello science works in mysterious ways

1800.559 --> 1803.8799999999999
ralph rodriguez

1808.159 --> 1811.0390000000002
oh

1808.96 --> 1814.8400000000001
mr gas hat

1811.039 --> 1814.84
jeff gassett hello

1831.2 --> 1836.64
yeah you're not trying to

1833.039 --> 1840.0
it wasn't real yeah but

1836.64 --> 1842.7990000000002
you haven't actually pulled up the data

1840.0 --> 1845.12
rasta hat you haven't pulled up the data

1842.799 --> 1847.84
and showed oh look see this that's not

1845.12 --> 1849.12
natural see that that's a man-made

1847.84 --> 1851.36
intervention

1849.12 --> 1854.799
you're not proving anything you're just

1851.36 --> 1854.799
saying it's impossible

1856.32 --> 1861.12
i mean

1857.519 --> 1865.72
for the world average yeah it's unlikely

1861.12 --> 1865.7199999999998
that doesn't make it impossible

1868.24 --> 1872.799
yeah and i appreciate

1870.159 --> 1875.679
well your analysis your heads up but you

1872.799 --> 1878.679
gotta lay down the data

1875.679 --> 1878.679
right

1887.76 --> 1892.799
like starting with temperature maps

1890.32 --> 1894.559
during that time

1892.799 --> 1896.559
you know the

1894.559 --> 1900.799
overview and you just see like the

1896.559 --> 1900.799
circles and from red to blue

1901.039 --> 1906.799
that data

1903.039 --> 1909.2
in like a time lapse and just look at it

1906.799 --> 1910.799
is that natural or is that completely

1909.2 --> 1914.8400000000001
unnatural did something out of the

1910.799 --> 1914.84
ordinary suddenly happen

1923.76 --> 1929.64
what source uh i don't know with

1926.64 --> 1929.64
meteorology

1929.919 --> 1933.919
i don't know

1931.679 --> 1938.0800000000002
i mean i'm pretty sure those types of

1933.919 --> 1938.0800000000002
maps are just available online

1945.36 --> 1951.519
there isn't yeah there is data there

1948.08 --> 1951.519
there is constant data

1955.039 --> 1958.48
i mean i don't know exactly where to

1957.12 --> 1960.1589999999999
find it

1958.48 --> 1963.3990000000001
but i bet there are people out there

1960.159 --> 1963.3990000000001
that do

1966.32 --> 1971.8799999999999
winter tornadoes are not uncommon what

1968.559 --> 1971.8799999999999
george sanford

1982.64 --> 1986.5590000000002
where are you getting that from like

1984.48 --> 1990.1200000000001
i've never even heard of a winter

1986.559 --> 1990.12
tornado before

1993.6 --> 1997.6789999999999
like it's not the normal season for

2002.84 --> 2009.36
it north carolina see a few every year

2007.12 --> 2009.36
what

2010.32 --> 2016.399
winter tornadoes like with snow and [ __ ]

2014.0 --> 2016.399
really

2017.679 --> 2023.0800000000002
do you have any references for that

2019.679 --> 2023.0800000000002
george sanford

2048.079 --> 2053.5600000000004
no snow in earth yeah well then it

2049.919 --> 2053.56
doesn't make it that's

2074.8 --> 2079.9190000000003
okay this is not gonna clear up the

2077.119 --> 2079.9190000000003
situation

2083.04 --> 2089.2799999999997
a little service day yeah good luck

2086.879 --> 2094.359
seems to be at least a very dry day

2089.28 --> 2094.3590000000004
today here in the netherlands so

2123.599 --> 2128.4
you're limited oh so you're just telling

2125.839 --> 2131.7999999999997
us to google it do ya surprise that all

2128.4 --> 2131.8
right fine

2146.32 --> 2150.3590000000004
a nathan oakley 1980

2184.4 --> 2190.2400000000002
200 mile dead yeah it is crazy look rest

2188.0 --> 2192.56
at i agree

2190.24 --> 2195.2
the sheer amount of damage it's

2192.56 --> 2197.2799999999997
it's unusual one way or the other like

2195.2 --> 2201.4399999999996
it's an extreme

2197.28 --> 2204.1600000000003
but still it doesn't prove

2201.44 --> 2206.0
there was man-made intervention

2204.16 --> 2209.04
and if there was

2206.0 --> 2211.28
weather charts will show it that's all

2209.04 --> 2213.119
i'm say i know it's right now kind of

2211.28 --> 2215.8390000000004
tough for you on your mobile trying to

2213.119 --> 2215.839
dig that up

2217.04 --> 2220.56
but it's like

2219.2 --> 2223.7599999999998
imagery

2220.56 --> 2226.7999999999997
that's been photoshopped it's impossible

2223.76 --> 2229.0400000000004
to hide that it's been photoshopped and

2226.8 --> 2230.96
the same way

2229.04 --> 2233.68
if you understand

2230.96 --> 2236.4
whether natural weather formation and

2233.68 --> 2238.72
the regions how they work and what

2236.4 --> 2240.56
typical weather intervention is

2238.72 --> 2241.7599999999998
then by the same

2240.56 --> 2244.88
system

2241.76 --> 2247.44
you can see when there has been weather

2244.88 --> 2250.32
manipulation intervention

2247.44 --> 2252.64
it leaves very distinct traces

2250.32 --> 2254.48
alterations that are visible in these

2252.64 --> 2257.48
weather charts

2254.48 --> 2257.48
so

2261.04 --> 2266.56
if you want to know if it was

2262.96 --> 2269.119
man-made altered weather manipulated you

2266.56 --> 2271.359
should be able to find proof of that if

2269.119 --> 2274.839
you can access the weather charts of

2271.359 --> 2274.839
that time period

2317.839 --> 2323.68
okay george sanford thank you that

2322.079 --> 2325.119
don't know where you plucked that from

2323.68 --> 2326.72
but

2325.119 --> 2328.48
right i i

2326.72 --> 2329.52
i'm gonna trust you didn't just make

2328.48 --> 2332.0
that up

2329.52 --> 2335.359
so okay interesting apparently there are

2332.0 --> 2337.92
cold season tornadoes then

2335.359 --> 2337.92
but still

2338.88 --> 2342.48
not

2339.68 --> 2342.48
this strong

2346.48 --> 2351.68
i mean they're really

2348.079 --> 2357.0
like crisis level tornadoes usually hit

2351.68 --> 2357.0
in the well tornado season you know

2370.24 --> 2374.9599999999996
right so let me just

2372.48 --> 2377.04
theorize for a bit

2374.96 --> 2379.44
with the la yeah with lack of data

2377.04 --> 2382.64
there's not much else i can do

2379.44 --> 2384.64
so what if it was just a regular

2382.64 --> 2387.2799999999997
cold season tornado which aren't

2384.64 --> 2389.7599999999998
supposed to be that strong

2387.28 --> 2389.76
and

2389.92 --> 2394.96
and then

2391.359 --> 2399.119
it was like hyped up it was empowered

2394.96 --> 2402.88
like a plane flew over dumped some stuff

2399.119 --> 2404.079
and then it became a monster tornado

2402.88 --> 2407.44
or

2404.079 --> 2410.4
they used haarp and basically

2407.44 --> 2412.48
hyped up the energy in a region which

2410.4 --> 2415.04
caused it to become super powerful now

2412.48 --> 2416.8
that is a potential possibility like

2415.04 --> 2419.7599999999998
they could do that they don't even need

2416.8 --> 2419.76
harp for that right

2419.839 --> 2424.0
can

2420.64 --> 2426.56
enhance or disintegrate tornadoes and

2424.0 --> 2429.28
that was even like in the 60s just using

2426.56 --> 2431.44
planes dropping stuff

2429.28 --> 2432.48
dropping certain chemicals

2431.44 --> 2434.48
so

2432.48 --> 2436.16
that could have happened

2434.48 --> 2438.4
all i'm saying it could have happened

2436.16 --> 2439.5989999999997
not saying it did happen but that's

2438.4 --> 2442.319
something

2439.599 --> 2443.3590000000004
to look out for

2442.319 --> 2445.52
to

2443.359 --> 2447.359
to check the data did something like

2445.52 --> 2450.48
that happen are there any signs that

2447.359 --> 2450.48
something like that happen

2450.64 --> 2454.72
right because i'm not excluding that

2452.56 --> 2457.7599999999998
that there wasn't

2454.72 --> 2459.04
man-made intervention

2457.76 --> 2461.8390000000004
but

2459.04 --> 2465.88
you yeah if there was you should be able

2461.839 --> 2465.88
to find evidence for that

2468.48 --> 2473.119
and then once you do

2470.64 --> 2475.359
you could even go on an investigation

2473.119 --> 2477.599
tour which might even be potentially

2475.359 --> 2481.68
dangerous

2477.599 --> 2483.52
and like trace back like okay

2481.68 --> 2485.839
was there an airport in the region where

2483.52 --> 2488.16
there seemed to be weather manipulation

2485.839 --> 2492.7999999999997
where it was officially registered a

2488.16 --> 2492.7999999999997
weather manipulation plane was launched

2492.96 --> 2497.119
or yeah maybe they all did it in secret

2495.599 --> 2500.8
and then you might bump into like oh

2497.119 --> 2504.1600000000003
this is a classified [ __ ] off

2500.8 --> 2505.92
don't inquire again or we'll shut down

2504.16 --> 2507.04
your internet or so i don't know

2505.92 --> 2509.839
something

2507.04 --> 2509.839
right

2511.2 --> 2514.64
i know maybe i'm taking it too far i

2513.2 --> 2516.7999999999997
think

2514.64 --> 2518.48
anyway

2516.8 --> 2521.3590000000004
whether data

2518.48 --> 2523.2
is required to figure out

2521.359 --> 2525.359
what really happened one way or the

2523.2 --> 2525.359
other

2531.839 --> 2536.7999999999997
no actual video of tornado

2535.04 --> 2539.599
huh

2536.8 --> 2543.2000000000003
well if it was like all snowstormy would

2539.599 --> 2543.2000000000003
there even be much to see

2544.4 --> 2549.119
do they get

2545.76 --> 2550.4
tornadoes in the netherlands no

2549.119 --> 2552.8
no

2550.4 --> 2554.319
i don't think a tornado ever hit land

2552.8 --> 2555.28
here

2554.319 --> 2558.4
i mean

2555.28 --> 2561.2000000000003
sometimes we've had times where we could

2558.4 --> 2564.2400000000002
see tornadoes like off

2561.2 --> 2566.56
in the sea like over the sea but they

2564.24 --> 2569.56
would never touch down on on on the

2566.56 --> 2569.56
coast

2580.16 --> 2584.359
hello by the way steamy traveler

2628.4 --> 2633.4
no source of evidence yet well it's not

2630.4 --> 2633.4
helping

2634.079 --> 2637.44
for 200 yeah but

2635.839 --> 2638.4
you're done

2637.44 --> 2639.2000000000003
okay

2638.4 --> 2641.44
hope

2639.2 --> 2645.7999999999997
you're relieved now because

2641.44 --> 2645.8
you kind of been squirting over this

2656.48 --> 2660.319
all right

2657.52 --> 2662.48
but hey look if you want to suggest that

2660.319 --> 2664.56
all data has been

2662.48 --> 2666.4
like completely cut off and is

2664.56 --> 2668.16
unavailable

2666.4 --> 2671.52
well that would be suspicious again

2668.16 --> 2673.2799999999997
because that normally never happens

2671.52 --> 2675.599
never

2673.28 --> 2678.599
whether data is always available for

2675.599 --> 2678.599
analysis

2692.079 --> 2695.48
hello jose

2721.52 --> 2726.16
okay well hey science works in

2722.96 --> 2727.839
mysterious ways okay

2726.16 --> 2729.92
could you find

2727.839 --> 2734.16
or could you yeah

2729.92 --> 2736.48
contact the meteorologist just you know

2734.16 --> 2738.96
maybe yeah get some weather charts to

2736.48 --> 2740.64
try and figure out

2738.96 --> 2744.4
what happened with that

2740.64 --> 2747.7599999999998
big tornado that wreaked so much havoc

2744.4 --> 2750.0
and maybe like email it to me email the

2747.76 --> 2754.5600000000004
some of the data you find

2750.0 --> 2754.56
like the temperature pressure charts

2754.8 --> 2758.88
if you can find it

2756.48 --> 2762.8
please email it to me and i'll

2758.88 --> 2762.8
try to present it on the show

2763.28 --> 2767.079
move to the next step

2777.04 --> 2780.52
all right excellent

2789.92 --> 2792.4
awesome

2793.28 --> 2798.2400000000002
because hey i am curious you know if it

2795.839 --> 2801.359
really was such an unusual weather event

2798.24 --> 2803.04
yeah then we you want to analyze it

2801.359 --> 2805.52
right

2803.04 --> 2808.079
but still i'm not excluding that no

2805.52 --> 2810.319
matter how bizarre it seemed it might be

2808.079 --> 2812.5600000000004
natural

2810.319 --> 2815.56
you never really know until you test the

2812.56 --> 2815.56
data

2872.079 --> 2875.92
want to hear a really crazy story

2876.24 --> 2882.64
i don't even know where i got it

2878.96 --> 2882.64
i literally don't know where i got it

2885.119 --> 2890.6400000000003
but it does like involve tornadoes like

2887.92 --> 2892.8
i heard somebody

2890.64 --> 2895.1189999999997
probably made it up

2892.8 --> 2897.28
but the idea is fascinating i heard

2895.119 --> 2900.319
somebody and this is like 20 years ago

2897.28 --> 2901.92
or something

2900.319 --> 2904.16
i don't know if it was in the waking

2901.92 --> 2907.04
world or in the dark world because then

2904.16 --> 2909.7599999999998
it could literally be anybody in the

2907.04 --> 2912.5589999999997
dark world i've been privy to

2909.76 --> 2916.4
contact like millions of people

2912.559 --> 2918.6400000000003
that have never faced in my lifetime

2916.4 --> 2918.64
so

2919.119 --> 2923.119
but i heard

2920.88 --> 2927.44
this weird thing

2923.119 --> 2930.2400000000002
where supposedly ancient druids

2927.44 --> 2930.2400000000002
in america

2930.559 --> 2934.48
would be able to

2932.079 --> 2937.28
do certain types of meditation in the

2934.48 --> 2940.88
storm season

2937.28 --> 2944.1600000000003
if it's really bad that would cause

2940.88 --> 2947.2000000000003
tornadoes to basically

2944.16 --> 2948.64
stabilize its position around them

2947.2 --> 2951.04
so they would be in the eye of the

2948.64 --> 2953.04
tornado and then they would keep the

2951.04 --> 2955.44
tornado

2953.04 --> 2958.0
centered on them so that their region

2955.44 --> 2960.8
would not be trashed

2958.0 --> 2964.16
until it died down

2960.8 --> 2965.92
and then like a ring of rubble

2964.16 --> 2968.48
that what picked up

2965.92 --> 2971.2000000000003
gets dropped like in a circle around

2968.48 --> 2973.839
well the grove right

2971.2 --> 2973.839
so yeah

2975.119 --> 2981.2000000000003
thought that was like a remarkable

2978.559 --> 2982.48
idea just alone i have no idea why i got

2981.2 --> 2984.96
that

2982.48 --> 2987.119
but yet it's like even in d d there is

2984.96 --> 2990.88
such a thing as like weather control

2987.119 --> 2990.88
spells for druids so

2991.119 --> 2998.04
probably didn't just

2993.76 --> 2998.0400000000004
make it up completely randomly

3000.559 --> 3006.2400000000002
right but since whether things are very

3003.04 --> 3008.319
electromagnetic and so are we and prayer

3006.24 --> 3011.2799999999997
and all that yeah maybe there were

3008.319 --> 3011.2799999999997
druids once

3011.44 --> 3014.96
in the lands when it was really wild

3012.96 --> 3019.52
that would literally manipulate the

3014.96 --> 3019.52
weather and like stabilize tornadoes

3019.839 --> 3027.0
with pure

3021.599 --> 3027.0
focus of will and all that amazing idea

3031.44 --> 3036.319
do you think you could use quantum

3033.839 --> 3036.319
locking

3036.48 --> 3039.48
what

3045.92 --> 3049.839
wait what

3048.24 --> 3054.52
are we talking about

3049.839 --> 3054.52
tornadoes shatner's bassoon

3064.079 --> 3069.8390000000004
indians had rainmakers well there's that

3067.119 --> 3069.839
right

3088.72 --> 3092.72
well i could

3090.319 --> 3096.16
i could imagine that

3092.72 --> 3098.64
certain types of actions spiritual

3096.16 --> 3101.2
if you're very strong could potentially

3098.64 --> 3103.1189999999997
do something like that and maybe it's

3101.2 --> 3105.4399999999996
not even just the druids like i can

3103.119 --> 3107.44
imagine just the same that like a church

3105.44 --> 3108.839
of really

3107.44 --> 3111.76
like

3108.839 --> 3114.88
pure super awake

3111.76 --> 3118.3190000000004
christians like in

3114.88 --> 3120.88
postcolonial america

3118.319 --> 3122.96
that were really attuned that they might

3120.88 --> 3124.96
be able to do it just well it's like ah

3122.96 --> 3127.119
storm season get in the church and all

3124.96 --> 3128.88
pray and then like literally it's the

3127.119 --> 3130.6400000000003
only building that's left standing or

3128.88 --> 3132.88
something

3130.64 --> 3132.8799999999997
right

3133.599 --> 3136.559
i would not be surprised if there would

3135.68 --> 3139.9199999999996
be

3136.559 --> 3142.1600000000003
like historical recorded situations like

3139.92 --> 3142.16
that

3144.24 --> 3147.9199999999996
not saying there are but hey

3148.72 --> 3151.8799999999997
you know

3156.72 --> 3160.5589999999997
limited magnet oh that

3162.8 --> 3166.52
quantum law yes

3166.72 --> 3170.48
it's just magnetic locking

3174.319 --> 3178.079
it has literally nothing to do with

3176.079 --> 3180.7200000000003
quantum is it just another word that

3178.079 --> 3183.44
somebody loved this to

3180.72 --> 3186.64
stamp with quantum to make it seem all

3183.44 --> 3189.04
super special future

3186.64 --> 3194.04
like quantum is the next level of

3189.04 --> 3194.04
futurist word you understand that

3194.079 --> 3198.2000000000003
most of it is complete nonsense

3212.319 --> 3217.2799999999997
yeah rastad i know

3215.04 --> 3218.4
i know i might be on to something

3217.28 --> 3221.119
not that i'm

3218.4 --> 3223.04
want to encourage everybody to do that

3221.119 --> 3225.359
i'm just saying

3223.04 --> 3227.839
it might be possible it might have even

3225.359 --> 3227.839
been done

3230.4 --> 3233.599
in times when

3231.76 --> 3237.8390000000004
yeah there was no

3233.599 --> 3237.839
geoengineering program at least

3265.359 --> 3271.04
okay mack leftward so the point

3269.599 --> 3274.1600000000003
shatner's bassoon why are you bringing

3271.04 --> 3274.16
this up out of nowhere

3275.2 --> 3279.839
maglev trains what is that supposed to

3277.599 --> 3279.839
do

3282.799 --> 3290.68
would it disprove rotation you mean off

3286.16 --> 3290.68
earth you're not serious are you

3296.72 --> 3300.319
i mean

3297.76 --> 3303.0400000000004
you need to disprove the rotation of

3300.319 --> 3304.24
earth using a maglev train

3303.04 --> 3306.96
uh

3304.24 --> 3310.0
well you could just

3306.96 --> 3313.119
well take notice that things suspended

3310.0 --> 3315.2
in mid-air aren't deviating constantly

3313.119 --> 3317.52
because of coriolis effect isn't that

3315.2 --> 3317.52
enough

3318.72 --> 3324.64
just ask yeah but look shatner's bassoon

3322.04 --> 3327.68
everything would prove the earth is

3324.64 --> 3330.5589999999997
rotating everything not maglev trains

3327.68 --> 3332.839
everything everything the the basic

3330.559 --> 3334.7200000000003
function of your balance organ

3332.839 --> 3336.88
everything

3334.72 --> 3339.04
everything everything would be

3336.88 --> 3340.96
influenced by the rotation everything

3339.04 --> 3342.88
constantly everything everything

3340.96 --> 3345.839
everything everything not just oh would

3342.88 --> 3348.88
a mac left yeah no everything would

3345.839 --> 3350.5589999999997
prove it would be rotating everything

3348.88 --> 3352.1600000000003
it isn't

3350.559 --> 3354.079
because the earth is in the spinning

3352.16 --> 3355.2
ball

3354.079 --> 3357.44
but yeah

3355.2 --> 3358.64
would the mech left rain prove yeah yeah

3357.44 --> 3360.079
so would

3358.64 --> 3362.4
a pole

3360.079 --> 3365.76
so would a a bucket

3362.4 --> 3370.52
so would a rabbit everything would prove

3365.76 --> 3370.5200000000004
the earth would be rotating if it was

3382.0 --> 3385.92
a plump would prove the earth would be

3384.24 --> 3388.9199999999996
rotating

3385.92 --> 3388.92
everything

3418.559 --> 3423.0400000000004
hey jeff gas head

3421.2 --> 3424.5589999999997
yeah and wrestle yeah i agree it is a

3423.04 --> 3426.4
good chill

3424.559 --> 3427.92
seem to have recovered

3426.4 --> 3430.839
fully

3427.92 --> 3433.599
just after like 10 minutes so that's

3430.839 --> 3434.5589999999997
great and it is an interesting subject

3433.599 --> 3436.88
you know

3434.559 --> 3439.44
like weather phenomenon especially now

3436.88 --> 3443.52
that we have knowledge that there is

3439.44 --> 3445.52
such a thing as a geoengineering program

3443.52 --> 3447.599
it's kind of interesting

3445.52 --> 3450.24
to just figure out like hey something

3447.599 --> 3452.4
extraordinary happened weather-wise is

3450.24 --> 3454.3999999999996
that all natural let's figure it out how

3452.4 --> 3457.04
do you figure it out

3454.4 --> 3459.28
well you take a look at the temperature

3457.04 --> 3461.52
pressure data

3459.28 --> 3463.6800000000003
and then see did something

3461.52 --> 3465.7599999999998
like impossible happen unnatural happen

3463.68 --> 3467.2799999999997
was there some kind of intervention at

3465.76 --> 3468.96
some point

3467.28 --> 3472.2400000000002
because especially like things like

3468.96 --> 3475.2
firing up harp that really stands out

3472.24 --> 3477.2
it's like a sudden blip where everything

3475.2 --> 3479.7599999999998
certainly is shifted

3477.2 --> 3482.319
in maybe just a short period like a big

3479.76 --> 3485.28
push all of a sudden

3482.319 --> 3487.2799999999997
but it's a pretty dramatic change when a

3485.28 --> 3489.8390000000004
device like that is utilized in the

3487.28 --> 3491.2000000000003
weather data you see it immediately like

3489.839 --> 3492.5589999999997
i've

3491.2 --> 3494.3999999999996
seen

3492.559 --> 3497.2000000000003
demonstrations

3494.4 --> 3500.079
well like weather charts where it was

3497.2 --> 3503.839
kind of known that it was used and then

3500.079 --> 3503.8390000000004
they showed it like see

3504.0 --> 3511.04
blips and like everything shifts

3507.28 --> 3511.0400000000004
so you see it when that happens

3511.119 --> 3515.359
you see when there is weather

3512.72 --> 3518.799
manipulation in the data

3515.359 --> 3518.799
if you have the weather charts

3528.319 --> 3534.16
right and by the way a singular still

3531.04 --> 3536.799
shot of one hour or something

3534.16 --> 3539.04
that's not the weather data

3536.799 --> 3543.2
right that doesn't really reveal super

3539.04 --> 3544.88
much it's more like in whether

3543.2 --> 3546.96
what's the weather report it's like oh

3544.88 --> 3549.28
this is the current situation and we

3546.96 --> 3552.0
predict it's going that they usually

3549.28 --> 3553.52
show still shots no you want a time

3552.0 --> 3555.52
lapse thing

3553.52 --> 3558.16
where you basically get to see like the

3555.52 --> 3561.04
temperature and the pressure data of an

3558.16 --> 3562.8799999999997
entire region over the time span of say

3561.04 --> 3566.64
a day

3562.88 --> 3566.6400000000003
and then if you play that

3566.799 --> 3571.52
then you can see if there's like certain

3568.96 --> 3574.4
aberrations

3571.52 --> 3577.28
just a singular still shot is not very

3574.4 --> 3579.6800000000003
revealing you got to see the contrast

3577.28 --> 3579.6800000000003
you see

3583.2 --> 3588.8799999999997
mike morales channel okay cool right

3586.88 --> 3591.28
well that would be a good

3588.88 --> 3593.119
person to contact about it then

3591.28 --> 3597.48
maybe he's already going after this

3593.119 --> 3597.48
right if he's into that sort of thing

3617.599 --> 3622.04
all right be right back two minutes

3693.359 --> 3696.359
hmm

3719.92 --> 3726.48
uk has more tornadoes but they're like

3723.68 --> 3729.52
more like water sprites comparatively

3726.48 --> 3729.52
just a bit of like

3729.76 --> 3736.0
like water carriers to dump more water

3732.88 --> 3736.0
on the land basically

3736.079 --> 3740.2000000000003
but they don't really do damage

3754.96 --> 3761.599
the climate changes pollution it's

3757.76 --> 3761.599
killing the planet wow okay that

3763.68 --> 3766.8799999999997
really

3764.64 --> 3769.839
you think

3766.88 --> 3769.839
i don't

3772.72 --> 3778.16
i mean

3774.72 --> 3781.2799999999997
the only thing that's really changing

3778.16 --> 3783.839
climate wise is the social climate

3781.28 --> 3788.0
and well the toxicity like there is a

3783.839 --> 3790.0789999999997
toxicity issues that damages life

3788.0 --> 3792.4
temperature shifts

3790.079 --> 3794.1600000000003
happen and they always happen they have

3792.4 --> 3795.6800000000003
always happened and they will always

3794.16 --> 3798.8799999999997
happen

3795.68 --> 3801.7599999999998
but actual like poison in the water and

3798.88 --> 3804.2400000000002
in the land that like destroys the

3801.76 --> 3805.8390000000004
natural bacteria that makes the soil

3804.24 --> 3809.0389999999998
good and all that

3805.839 --> 3812.319
that's a real problem

3809.039 --> 3814.7990000000004
also human hysteria that's a real

3812.319 --> 3814.799
problem

3815.2 --> 3819.2
so

3816.319 --> 3822.799
temperature shifts like the the actual

3819.2 --> 3822.799
environmental changes

3822.839 --> 3828.96
no that's not a problem that's always

3825.839 --> 3831.44
existed and it will always change

3828.96 --> 3834.64
and dramatically sometimes and it has

3831.44 --> 3834.64
nothing to do

3835.44 --> 3839.839
with what humans do in their industry

3841.2 --> 3846.0
anymore that is right in the

3843.119 --> 3847.92
industrialization like early factory

3846.0 --> 3848.88
smoke stacks and all that

3847.92 --> 3851.92
yeah

3848.88 --> 3853.839
that has a literal impact on the

3851.92 --> 3855.119
environment because

3853.839 --> 3857.68
well

3855.119 --> 3860.319
those materials are literally like

3857.68 --> 3863.44
catalyzers for weather manipulation like

3860.319 --> 3865.68
they literally change

3863.44 --> 3868.2400000000002
the dynamics right

3865.68 --> 3870.48
that's why they have all cut it down and

3868.24 --> 3874.0789999999997
it's like cut down the pollution so that

3870.48 --> 3876.2400000000002
it's like only moist and co2

3874.079 --> 3879.28
with coal plants and all that

3876.24 --> 3882.16
that doesn't change the weather

3879.28 --> 3884.559
it actually helps

3882.16 --> 3887.92
it helps the nature it's good for nature

3884.559 --> 3889.3590000000004
there's nothing better for nature

3887.92 --> 3892.079
than a

3889.359 --> 3894.799
a coal power plant

3892.079 --> 3896.96
it's literally the best thing for nature

3894.799 --> 3899.0389999999998
ever everywhere where those things are

3896.96 --> 3900.799
if they're clean and not just like

3899.039 --> 3903.5200000000004
spouting out all the

3900.799 --> 3906.16
toxic garbage unscrubbed

3903.52 --> 3907.839
everywhere where clean coal power plants

3906.16 --> 3911.2799999999997
are around

3907.839 --> 3914.48
nature literally thrives

3911.28 --> 3916.96
plants grow greener grow bigger all of

3914.48 --> 3918.48
it it always happens because it's

3916.96 --> 3923.039
awesome

3918.48 --> 3927.119
it doesn't change the weather patterns

3923.039 --> 3927.119
only particulate stuff

3928.4 --> 3934.1600000000003
does that typically

3930.96 --> 3934.16
and they're all scrubbed out

3934.839 --> 3940.0789999999997
right now of course like

3937.599 --> 3943.119
pretty severe chemical industries that

3940.079 --> 3945.92
basically vent off excess

3943.119 --> 3948.4
chemical gases that are like not very

3945.92 --> 3948.4
natural

3948.96 --> 3955.359
like say for yeah it's a bad example but

3952.64 --> 3958.4
i know for example ammonia has like

3955.359 --> 3959.839
weather manipulative qualities weirdly

3958.4 --> 3962.64
enough

3959.839 --> 3964.96
it it does because of like i don't know

3962.64 --> 3966.8799999999997
it's it's complicated so let's say

3964.96 --> 3968.48
there's a chemical industry this doesn't

3966.88 --> 3970.4
actually happen but let's just say there

3968.48 --> 3971.52
was a chemical industry it's booming

3970.4 --> 3973.92
it's big

3971.52 --> 3977.119
big industry and they literally just

3973.92 --> 3981.359
pump out ammonia gas all day long with

3977.119 --> 3984.96
tons and tons per hour right now that

3981.359 --> 3985.7599999999998
would absolutely influence the weather

3984.96 --> 3987.039
right

3985.76 --> 3988.7990000000004
that would

3987.039 --> 3992.7200000000003
but that doesn't happen

3988.799 --> 3994.96
the industries don't do that

3992.72 --> 3997.2
because if they did everybody would

3994.96 --> 4001.039
start to pick up on it and be like this

3997.2 --> 4001.0389999999998
freaking factory is a curse

4001.599 --> 4006.799
everything is dying here

4004.799 --> 4009.599
water is bad and

4006.799 --> 4011.119
animals are getting miscarriages right

4009.599 --> 4012.4
and that way you know like there's

4011.119 --> 4013.839
something wrong there's something

4012.4 --> 4015.76
polluting

4013.839 --> 4017.44
like the weather's gone completely

4015.76 --> 4019.5200000000004
insane

4017.44 --> 4022.079
like we've had droughts where when this

4019.52 --> 4022.88
is supposed to be like a wet region

4022.079 --> 4025.6800000000003
right

4022.88 --> 4025.6800000000003
that sort of thing

4029.599 --> 4036.4
so any kind of hazards

4032.799 --> 4038.799
that were perceived from industry that

4036.4 --> 4041.359
would all that would literally

4038.799 --> 4043.92
negatively impact the climate

4041.359 --> 4045.88
they have all been resolved it has been

4043.92 --> 4048.799
figured out because in the

4045.88 --> 4051.839
industrialization that was happening it

4048.799 --> 4053.839
was happening

4051.839 --> 4054.72
that was happening the the climate would

4053.839 --> 4057.7599999999998
be

4054.72 --> 4061.52
like ravaged would go crazy

4057.76 --> 4064.6400000000003
things like black snow and [ __ ]

4061.52 --> 4067.28
right smoke stacks and then snow all of

4064.64 --> 4069.2799999999997
a sudden and then black creepy ass [ __ ]

4067.28 --> 4071.119
sometimes and poisonous

4069.28 --> 4073.599
bad bad news but

4071.119 --> 4077.2400000000002
it's been figured out and now

4073.599 --> 4077.2400000000002
that can be prevented

4077.28 --> 4082.2400000000002
modern industry has learned those

4079.76 --> 4082.2400000000002
lessons

4084.559 --> 4088.3190000000004
at least in the west mostly

4089.359 --> 4093.119
right so yeah climate change climate

4091.359 --> 4096.4
change oh man made climate change yeah

4093.119 --> 4099.679
yeah yeah you're 200 years too late

4096.4 --> 4101.199
like yeah 200 years ago

4099.679 --> 4102.4800000000005
is it right

4101.199 --> 4105.3589999999995
nah

4102.48 --> 4106.639999999999
no more like a hundred years ago

4105.359 --> 4107.359
150

4106.64 --> 4109.1990000000005
yeah

4107.359 --> 4110.56
around the industrialization 19th

4109.199 --> 4114.5599999999995
century

4110.56 --> 4118.799
yeah that was an issue big big issue

4114.56 --> 4121.04
like villages died because of that

4118.799 --> 4122.719
right entire villages would die because

4121.04 --> 4125.04
of the poisoning of industry and all

4122.719 --> 4126.719
that [ __ ] it would happen

4125.04 --> 4130.799
that's not

4126.719 --> 4130.799
any that's not the situation anymore

4131.359 --> 4134.799
it's a complete straw man

4141.92 --> 4146.56
hello nathan r

4143.679 --> 4149.04
yes i remember that

4146.56 --> 4152.56
then livingston father of weaponized

4149.04 --> 4155.6
weather yeah i've seen that

4152.56 --> 4155.6
been around for a while

4157.04 --> 4162.159
effects on climate or long-term yeah

4159.12 --> 4164.96
it's long-term [ __ ]

4162.159 --> 4166.719
professor phil bell long-term [ __ ]

4164.96 --> 4168.96
it doesn't work all these freaking

4166.719 --> 4172.0
hockey like anything

4168.96 --> 4175.199
anytime any sort of person

4172.0 --> 4177.679
supposedly that is war climate warn

4175.199 --> 4178.48
alarmist whatever every time you say oh

4177.679 --> 4181.359
it's

4178.48 --> 4183.678999999999
in 20 [ __ ] it's all [ __ ] it's

4181.359 --> 4185.52
all [ __ ] it's always all [ __ ]

4183.679 --> 4187.92
look at how many of these predictions

4185.52 --> 4190.1990000000005
have been made by these people and look

4187.92 --> 4194.719
how absolutely

4190.199 --> 4199.04
180 degrees wrong they were every single

4194.719 --> 4200.56
time 180 degrees wrong totally off

4199.04 --> 4203.199
target every

4200.56 --> 4206.88
stupid climate change sort of prediction

4203.199 --> 4210.159
made that was used as alarmism was all

4206.88 --> 4212.32
wrong all of it all of it all of it all

4210.159 --> 4214.239
of it all of it wrong

4212.32 --> 4217.84
it's horseshit

4214.239 --> 4219.599999999999
it's all stupid unless you can literally

4217.84 --> 4222.32
prove

4219.6 --> 4224.96
that something is originally happening

4222.32 --> 4227.199
because of industry or whatever and you

4224.96 --> 4230.199
can literally prove see it's different

4227.199 --> 4230.199
here

4230.32 --> 4232.88
then there is

4231.679 --> 4236.2390000000005
no

4232.88 --> 4240.159000000001
universal climate change it's [ __ ]

4236.239 --> 4240.159
it's total [ __ ] all of it

4242.4 --> 4247.12
only the kind it is yeah but it's always

4244.96 --> 4249.92
changing professor phil bell it has

4247.12 --> 4253.12
always been changing and guess what even

4249.92 --> 4255.84
if the entirety of humanity would be

4253.12 --> 4257.44
extinct there would be no more humans

4255.84 --> 4260.8
guess what

4257.44 --> 4264.239
it's still gonna be changing

4260.8 --> 4267.12
it will never stop changing

4264.239 --> 4270.4
it's not the humans that cause the

4267.12 --> 4275.64
climate change the climate changes

4270.4 --> 4275.639999999999
whether the humans are involved or not

4292.64 --> 4296.0
that's right clapper cause i know what

4294.159 --> 4298.48
i'm talking about they're always wrong

4296.0 --> 4300.88
it's almost like

4298.48 --> 4303.44
they would be shocked if they would

4300.88 --> 4306.0
actually get it right once

4303.44 --> 4308.5599999999995
because they never get it right

4306.0 --> 4311.12
like people that have been on to this

4308.56 --> 4314.159000000001
their entire life

4311.12 --> 4316.4
like 50 years of being part of those

4314.159 --> 4318.879999999999
think tanks and like

4316.4 --> 4321.96
propaganda groups for climate change

4318.88 --> 4324.1990000000005
they always wrong

4321.96 --> 4327.28
always wrong

4324.199 --> 4328.5599999999995
always wrong okay

4327.28 --> 4331.36
that's like

4328.56 --> 4334.4800000000005
when you're that wrong that consistently

4331.36 --> 4338.0
if you get things right just once

4334.48 --> 4340.639999999999
is like a mind-blowing event

4338.0 --> 4344.96
where like mass hysteria would break out

4340.64 --> 4344.96
because they're always wrong

4347.92 --> 4353.04
right even a broken clock

4351.28 --> 4355.199
is more right

4353.04 --> 4357.679
than these climate change prediction

4355.199 --> 4361.839999999999
people

4357.679 --> 4361.84
the broken clock is more right

4362.64 --> 4365.96
that's right

4370.0 --> 4376.56
right but yeah it's logical that climate

4372.64 --> 4378.96
change propagandists are always wrong

4376.56 --> 4381.679
because their model is based on the

4378.96 --> 4385.44
heliocentric understanding of earth and

4381.679 --> 4388.64
it's all complete [ __ ]

4385.44 --> 4394.239
like the entire framework premise of

4388.64 --> 4397.280000000001
everything they say is complete [ __ ]

4394.239 --> 4398.48
total horseshit

4397.28 --> 4402.159
every time

4398.48 --> 4404.879999999999
because it's all based on globe

4402.159 --> 4408.04
cosmology understanding of what's going

4404.88 --> 4412.04
on and it's wrong

4408.04 --> 4412.04
blatantly wrong

4415.47 --> 4418.56
[Music]

4419.6 --> 4422.88
nothing works that way

4424.4 --> 4428.239
there's not gonna be a hole in the ozone

4426.56 --> 4430.0
layer ever

4428.239 --> 4433.28
there is no

4430.0 --> 4434.719
ozone layer that does anything

4433.28 --> 4436.48
i mean there might be a layer where

4434.719 --> 4438.56
there's like a little bit more ozone

4436.48 --> 4440.4
happen to be lingering there it doesn't

4438.56 --> 4442.719
do anything

4440.4 --> 4444.719
maybe it influences like the electric

4442.719 --> 4448.4800000000005
balance of the electric ether or

4444.719 --> 4451.52
whatever in the system somewhat

4448.48 --> 4453.5199999999995
it doesn't like oh my god there's a hole

4451.52 --> 4456.88
in it now the sun will burn us that's

4453.52 --> 4457.92
all complete horseshit

4456.88 --> 4460.56
that's just

4457.92 --> 4461.92
that's just where they started

4460.56 --> 4464.0
right

4461.92 --> 4466.84
co2 oh no

4464.0 --> 4470.88
it's going to prevent the sun from

4466.84 --> 4474.56
reflecting back out of the atmosphere

4470.88 --> 4474.56
who came up with that [ __ ]

4475.92 --> 4481.12
it doesn't work

4478.4 --> 4482.48
it doesn't heat up [ __ ] the only thing

4481.12 --> 4485.04
it does

4482.48 --> 4486.718999999999
is make plants more green and grow

4485.04 --> 4489.679
faster

4486.719 --> 4493.4800000000005
that's like the only influence it does

4489.679 --> 4493.4800000000005
that's the only thing it does

4505.12 --> 4511.36
right and besides right now

4508.159 --> 4515.679
for a decade now the industry has so

4511.36 --> 4515.679
much like cut into like

4515.84 --> 4521.28
well the co2 production universally with

4518.48 --> 4523.44
a lot of things that it's actually

4521.28 --> 4526.159
measurably becoming detrimental for

4523.44 --> 4528.96
nature like it's measured that hel the

4526.159 --> 4530.879999999999
health of nature

4528.96 --> 4532.32
is

4530.88 --> 4535.36
dropping

4532.32 --> 4538.36
because there's less co2 production it's

4535.36 --> 4538.36
measurable

4548.56 --> 4551.56
right

4563.36 --> 4569.839999999999
oh shut up professor phil bell you idiot

4567.52 --> 4572.719
new delhi and mumbai

4569.84 --> 4576.2390000000005
do not have a co2 problem

4572.719 --> 4579.679
they have a particulate problem

4576.239 --> 4582.0
and they don't scrub their ship

4579.679 --> 4585.4400000000005
it's all just thrown out and it's

4582.0 --> 4589.76
literally toxic

4585.44 --> 4592.0
toxic chemicals particulates dust

4589.76 --> 4595.6
and then you have all the well the [ __ ]

4592.0 --> 4597.36
in the streets it's not helping either

4595.6 --> 4600.159000000001
because that also just goes floating

4597.36 --> 4600.96
around that's very unhealthy

4600.159 --> 4604.5599999999995
right

4600.96 --> 4605.76
it's not a co2 problem

4604.56 --> 4607.679
it's

4605.76 --> 4609.6
the rest of it

4607.679 --> 4612.8
it's because their industries aren't

4609.6 --> 4615.84
clean that is the problem it's not the

4612.8 --> 4618.719
co2 production that's not the problem

4615.84 --> 4621.12
it's all the rest the co2 is like the

4618.719 --> 4623.12
only not problem

4621.12 --> 4625.679
it's the only non-problem within

4623.12 --> 4625.679
industry

4626.719 --> 4632.0
right and yeah seriously the whole co2

4630.32 --> 4635.5199999999995
[ __ ]

4632.0 --> 4640.159
it's it's the most satanic

4635.52 --> 4640.159000000001
[ __ ] project they have ever done

4643.84 --> 4648.56
it

4645.12 --> 4648.5599999999995
it kind of equates to

4648.64 --> 4655.1990000000005
laying down claims that like blood is

4652.0 --> 4656.719
unhealthy having blood is unhealthy

4655.199 --> 4659.28
you have to tap some of that you have

4656.719 --> 4662.32
too much blood you're becoming unhealthy

4659.28 --> 4666.0
that's literally what it equates to

4662.32 --> 4667.599999999999
it's crazy co2 is like the ultimate

4666.0 --> 4669.36
reward

4667.6 --> 4671.84
from industry

4669.36 --> 4673.599999999999
everything else is poison

4671.84 --> 4676.0
right all the particulates all the

4673.6 --> 4677.76
chemicals that's bad news you got to get

4676.0 --> 4680.88
it out you got to scrub it

4677.76 --> 4680.88
you got to clean that up

4681.199 --> 4688.4
make sure it doesn't harm nature

4684.64 --> 4693.64
right the co2 is the reward it's the

4688.4 --> 4693.639999999999
reward it's what the plants need

4694.64 --> 4700.88
it improves everything it improves crops

4697.92 --> 4702.64
in farming it improves the quality of

4700.88 --> 4705.4400000000005
natural

4702.64 --> 4708.159000000001
forestry all that

4705.44 --> 4711.44
it literally makes plants go

4708.159 --> 4714.159
grow faster it's like oh you have a

4711.44 --> 4716.4
lumber company in a region that's like

4714.159 --> 4718.5599999999995
forced designated for a lumbery

4716.4 --> 4720.799999999999
you need more of it well guess what

4718.56 --> 4722.96
build a coal power plant in there and

4720.8 --> 4725.12
it's all gonna grow faster you'll be

4722.96 --> 4727.84
able to cut more trees

4725.12 --> 4731.4
that's how it works

4727.84 --> 4731.400000000001
it needs co2

4734.159 --> 4738.32
when did i say you do when are you going

4736.239 --> 4741.759999999999
to spam that [ __ ] here professor phil

4738.32 --> 4741.759999999999
bell you need a timeout

4741.92 --> 4744.719
yeah

4742.88 --> 4745.679
we were talking about climate change

4744.719 --> 4747.679
right

4745.679 --> 4749.6
well what is intrical what is the key

4747.679 --> 4752.32
cornerstone in the whole narrative of

4749.6 --> 4756.08
climate change it's co2

4752.32 --> 4758.5599999999995
i don't care what you say

4756.08 --> 4758.5599999999995
about it

4758.8 --> 4766.2390000000005
co2 is the designated target

4762.88 --> 4766.2390000000005
and it is an atrocity

4773.92 --> 4779.52
right and if you agree with that then

it's epic

5201.36 --> 5204.239
thank you so much

5208.4 --> 5214.48
right so we were still i was talking

5211.28 --> 5214.48
about climate change

5215.52 --> 5222.719
professor phil bell is just saying oh

5219.199 --> 5225.599999999999
i was talking not about co2 what about

5222.719 --> 5228.159
pollution right

5225.6 --> 5231.04
well yeah general pollution

5228.159 --> 5234.5599999999995
particulate pollution chemical pollution

5231.04 --> 5236.08
non-co2 chemical non-water

5234.56 --> 5238.4800000000005
chemical

5236.08 --> 5240.32
yeah it is a problem and that's just

5238.48 --> 5242.5599999999995
that's the real pollution problem it's

5240.32 --> 5243.92
always been the pollution problem and it

5242.56 --> 5246.2390000000005
should be

5243.92 --> 5249.2390000000005
the primary focus of all

5246.239 --> 5249.239
environmentalism

5249.28 --> 5254.8
like

5250.84 --> 5257.6
environmentalism that focuses on co2

5254.8 --> 5257.6
is a fraud

5258.639 --> 5264.0
like

5259.92 --> 5268.76
undeniably it is a fraud

5264.0 --> 5270.639
if some organization that says they are

5268.76 --> 5272.4800000000005
environmentalists

5270.639 --> 5275.679
registered as such

5272.48 --> 5278.638999999999
and they exclusively deal in bringing

5275.679 --> 5280.96
down co2 and

5278.639 --> 5283.84
like the whole uh was it

5280.96 --> 5285.679
carbon credit trading it's a scam it's a

5283.84 --> 5288.08
corporate scam that's not an

5285.679 --> 5289.679
environmentalist that's a fake

5288.08 --> 5291.5199999999995
environmentalist

5289.679 --> 5295.28
they're actually quite the opposite

5291.52 --> 5296.639
their influence destroys and pollutes

5295.28 --> 5297.5199999999995
nature

5296.639 --> 5299.04
yeah

5297.52 --> 5303.679
that's right

5299.04 --> 5306.0
it destroys and pollutes nature

5303.679 --> 5309.92
environmentalists

5306.0 --> 5312.96
that are purely focused on co2 issues

5309.92 --> 5315.6
or have it as their primary thing

5312.96 --> 5319.88
are a corporate scam

5315.6 --> 5319.88
they are actually anti-environmentalists

5321.199 --> 5325.28
real environmentalists they deal

5324.159 --> 5326.879999999999
in

5325.28 --> 5328.32
making sure

5326.88 --> 5331.92
ground

5328.32 --> 5334.799999999999
is clean water is clean

5331.92 --> 5336.719
taking a careful look at industries how

5334.8 --> 5339.76
can you improve the

5336.719 --> 5342.32
the waste products that come out of it

5339.76 --> 5344.639
how can you limit the damage

5342.32 --> 5346.5599999999995
right it's not about oh shutting down

5344.639 --> 5349.52
industries

5346.56 --> 5352.4800000000005
because some turtle somewhere

5349.52 --> 5354.400000000001
it's all special no that's [ __ ]

5352.48 --> 5356.959999999999
you just need to be

5354.4 --> 5358.96
real about okay there's an industry what

5356.96 --> 5361.679
goes in what comes out

5358.96 --> 5364.2390000000005
is there chemicals coming out

5361.679 --> 5365.76
how we make sure those don't damage the

5364.239 --> 5367.199
environment

5365.76 --> 5370.2390000000005
that's

5367.199 --> 5371.36
real environmentalism

5370.239 --> 5372.159
and

5371.36 --> 5374.719
it's

5372.159 --> 5377.28
almost kind of like journalism the real

5374.719 --> 5378.639
journalism right a real journalist gets

5377.28 --> 5381.28
in the way

5378.639 --> 5383.679
a real journalist is very inconvenient

5381.28 --> 5385.679
and so is a real environmentalist

5383.679 --> 5388.96
because environmentalism

5385.679 --> 5388.96
is not profitable

5389.199 --> 5393.599999999999
it's always going to be met with ah damn

5391.36 --> 5395.679
it that means we have to do more it's

5393.6 --> 5398.719
gonna cost me more

5395.679 --> 5400.1990000000005
and so yeah industrialists

5398.719 --> 5403.52
might have a tendency to hate

5400.199 --> 5406.799999999999
environmentalists the real ones not the

5403.52 --> 5410.400000000001
fake ones that actually destroyed nature

5406.8 --> 5410.400000000001
with their co2 scam

5410.88 --> 5413.1990000000005
yeah

5413.76 --> 5418.400000000001
because real environmentalists they

5416.159 --> 5421.28
pay close attention is there any actual

5418.4 --> 5424.5599999999995
pollutants coming out of this

5421.28 --> 5424.5599999999995
and then try to stop it

5424.639 --> 5429.84
with yeah depending on the government

5426.88 --> 5432.08
also but with fines and

5429.84 --> 5434.159000000001
regulations and yeah that's a hassle

5432.08 --> 5436.239
that's annoying but it keeps things

5434.159 --> 5437.92
clean

5436.239 --> 5441.44
for everybody

5437.92 --> 5442.32
it's actually necessary

5441.44 --> 5444.799999999999
but

5442.32 --> 5447.28
if you're gonna do that

5444.8 --> 5449.92
it's still gotta be yeah businesses

5447.28 --> 5452.96
still have to be viable

5449.92 --> 5456.639
it still has to be

5452.96 --> 5459.679
like it has to keep being able to run

5456.639 --> 5462.400000000001
the the amount of extra costs and effort

5459.679 --> 5464.32
to keep it clean can't actually destroy

5462.4 --> 5466.0
the business

5464.32 --> 5468.5599999999995
because then yeah it doesn't work

5466.0 --> 5471.36
anymore so another way has to be found

5468.56 --> 5471.360000000001
to deal with that

5472.8 --> 5477.04
yeah restructuring

5475.36 --> 5480.96
or perhaps

5477.04 --> 5482.56
like well incentive from the public

5480.96 --> 5484.88
through government and yeah that's going

5482.56 --> 5487.04
to mean sort of socialism taxation

5484.88 --> 5489.12
that's annoying i know

5487.04 --> 5490.719
but what are you going to do just wreck

5489.12 --> 5493.12
the businesses because they can't

5490.719 --> 5494.8
function anymore or are you going to

5493.12 --> 5498.719
kind of like

5494.8 --> 5501.1990000000005
help them through public funding through

5498.719 --> 5503.52
taxation funding

5501.199 --> 5504.719
to be more clean without wrecking their

5503.52 --> 5506.320000000001
business

5504.719 --> 5507.88
see

5506.32 --> 5511.12
now that's kind of like

5507.88 --> 5513.28
environmentalism socialism in a way

5511.12 --> 5516.8
and it's not that bad

5513.28 --> 5519.28
because everything stays clean

5516.8 --> 5522.8
and you can then kind of

5519.28 --> 5524.4
save on medical expenditures for the

5522.8 --> 5525.6
same people

5524.4 --> 5527.5199999999995
you see

5525.6 --> 5529.679
if you stay real if you don't have a

5527.52 --> 5532.0
predatory system where you want

5529.679 --> 5534.4800000000005
everybody to be sick and dying so you

5532.0 --> 5535.76
can rip more money from them

5534.48 --> 5537.599999999999
right

5535.76 --> 5538.4800000000005
through the medical industry and all

5537.6 --> 5540.400000000001
that

5538.48 --> 5541.678999999999
and insurance companies and all that

5540.4 --> 5544.0
[ __ ]

5541.679 --> 5546.56
eugenics

5544.0 --> 5548.8
so if you have proper environmental

5546.56 --> 5550.719
regulations with some

5548.8 --> 5553.6
taxation funding

5550.719 --> 5556.56
businesses can still keep going

5553.6 --> 5558.159000000001
not be polluting and not go out of

5556.56 --> 5560.8
business because of the the

5558.159 --> 5563.599999999999
environmental extra costs

5560.8 --> 5565.4400000000005
it's worth it in my opinion

5563.6 --> 5567.76
but it's something that requires a

5565.44 --> 5569.759999999999
refined balance and

5567.76 --> 5572.88
understanding

5569.76 --> 5574.719
understanding in the people that work

5572.88 --> 5577.92
there that have the business and the

5574.719 --> 5580.2390000000005
people in the region that will have to

5577.92 --> 5582.8
recognize the value

5580.239 --> 5584.08
of the extra taxation

5582.8 --> 5586.4800000000005
and

5584.08 --> 5589.44
make sure it doesn't get hijacked by

5586.48 --> 5591.36
politicians again oh they ran away with

5589.44 --> 5593.36
a pot of money designated for

5591.36 --> 5595.679
environmentalists oh we're gonna do a

5593.36 --> 5598.0
special investment project in some

5595.679 --> 5600.08
freaking carbon trading oh

5598.0 --> 5602.32
yeah yeah that's

5600.08 --> 5604.639
that's not what you want it has to

5602.32 --> 5605.599999999999
actually be spent

5604.639 --> 5607.1990000000005
on

5605.6 --> 5610.8
real

5607.199 --> 5610.799999999999
environmental issues

5611.12 --> 5616.48
making sure that polluting of

5614.0 --> 5619.92
water ground and air

5616.48 --> 5625.08
can be minimalized in industries

5619.92 --> 5625.08
not co2 scam crap

5633.76 --> 5637.76
why should the taxpayer help business

5636.08 --> 5640.48
well

5637.76 --> 5640.4800000000005
why do you think

5643.12 --> 5646.32
what do you think lloyd cole

5647.36 --> 5652.08
oh we're not gonna pay them okay

5650.239 --> 5655.36
we'll just dump our

5652.08 --> 5656.88
chemical waste in in the freaking

5655.36 --> 5659.839999999999
in the sewers

5656.88 --> 5659.84
you deal with it then

5660.239 --> 5662.48
right

5664.48 --> 5669.36
oh and then oh they get caught you

5666.96 --> 5672.0
arrest them oh guess what no more

5669.36 --> 5674.48
business no more industry oh this

5672.0 --> 5676.4
certain line of products just stopped

5674.48 --> 5678.5599999999995
because they went bust

5676.4 --> 5679.5199999999995
is that what you want then

5678.56 --> 5681.6
lloyd

5679.52 --> 5684.0
so what do you want you want

5681.6 --> 5685.360000000001
cheap cheap cheap oh no hassle no

5684.0 --> 5687.6
taxation

5685.36 --> 5689.599999999999
and then everything goes to [ __ ] because

5687.6 --> 5691.679
everything is polluted polluted

5689.6 --> 5693.52
groundwater polluted

5691.679 --> 5695.76
ocean

5693.52 --> 5699.040000000001
polluted ground but hey

5695.76 --> 5700.8
you didn't have to pay those taxes

5699.04 --> 5703.44
you just have to live on the poison

5700.8 --> 5704.320000000001
ground of your own greed

5703.44 --> 5706.48
you know

5704.32 --> 5711.5599999999995
that's i'm pretty sure that's probably

5706.48 --> 5711.5599999999995
worth it to you lloyd cole isn't it

5736.159 --> 5739.159
hmm

5743.84 --> 5748.719
help me that's not what i'm saying lloyd

5746.48 --> 5748.718999999999
call

5748.8 --> 5753.84
dick

5750.639 --> 5756.0
don't you [ __ ] dare shove communism

5753.84 --> 5757.76
into what i just explained that's not

5756.0 --> 5759.76
what i'm saying and that's saying to

5757.76 --> 5762.719
fund businesses

5759.76 --> 5765.04
saying you go to the business you see

5762.719 --> 5769.52
where they have chemical issues

5765.04 --> 5772.719
and then you ensure that's dealt with

5769.52 --> 5775.119000000001
without basically just making it so

5772.719 --> 5778.2390000000005
costly for that business that they can't

5775.119 --> 5778.239
operate anymore

5783.04 --> 5787.76
that's not just giving money to business

5787.92 --> 5791.6
that's not what i'm saying at all

5795.04 --> 5801.28
it's more like taxation

5797.679 --> 5801.28
for pollution prevention

5804.32 --> 5808.08
i mean

5805.84 --> 5810.32
do you want pollution prevention or you

5808.08 --> 5812.5599999999995
don't give a [ __ ]

5810.32 --> 5815.5199999999995
that the ground is so freaking toxic

5812.56 --> 5817.6
that if you just dug a well somewhere

5815.52 --> 5819.6
in that region and you took a sip of

5817.6 --> 5821.6
that water you'd be dead the next day

5819.6 --> 5823.280000000001
are you okay with that

5821.6 --> 5825.280000000001
is that cool

5823.28 --> 5828.159
as long as she do as long as you don't

5825.28 --> 5830.88
call it communist right

5828.159 --> 5834.0
that's okay

5830.88 --> 5834.0
are you serious lloyd

5837.84 --> 5844.400000000001
should be regulated not taxpayer funded

5842.159 --> 5844.4
well

5845.76 --> 5850.8
look it's extra things that are required

5849.119 --> 5853.679
somebody's gonna pay for it so you're

5850.8 --> 5854.400000000001
gonna force the businesses to pay for it

5853.679 --> 5856.56
well

5854.4 --> 5858.96
that will mean that some businesses just

5856.56 --> 5862.159000000001
can't get around so they will be like on

5858.96 --> 5865.119
the edge of going broke

5862.159 --> 5865.119
is that what you want

5867.679 --> 5871.4400000000005
i'm just trying to be realistic

5874.639 --> 5880.2390000000005
business should take care of itself

5876.239 --> 5880.239
without money yeah well that's cool

5880.4 --> 5886.239
but yeah that's gonna make it very tough

5883.52 --> 5888.96
it's very tough

5886.239 --> 5891.678999999999
so you got to be like a environmentalist

5888.96 --> 5894.2390000000005
visionary to really know how to get it

5891.679 --> 5897.36
perfect

5894.239 --> 5899.44
or it's gonna cost you money

5897.36 --> 5900.639
and yeah if

5899.44 --> 5903.599999999999
businesses

5900.639 --> 5906.400000000001
have expenditures that are not actually

5903.6 --> 5907.4400000000005
yielding directly palpable profits to

5906.4 --> 5909.119
them

5907.44 --> 5912.96
that's a detriment

5909.119 --> 5912.96
that can ruin businesses

5915.36 --> 5920.48
so

5916.88 --> 5920.4800000000005
right it's a matter of perspective

5922.4 --> 5930.799999999999
well yeah okay dude shut the [ __ ] up

5927.84 --> 5932.08
you dumbass i'm not talking about that

5930.8 --> 5934.4800000000005
[ __ ]

5932.08 --> 5936.639
yeah don't you [ __ ] call what i just

5934.48 --> 5938.718999999999
talked about communism it has nothing to

5936.639 --> 5941.04
do with it it only thing i'm talking

5938.719 --> 5944.159
about is environmentalism

5941.04 --> 5948.159
real environmentalism

5944.159 --> 5948.159
prevent tax scamming [ __ ]

5951.44 --> 5954.879999999999
yeah because that's the problem it's

5953.679 --> 5958.0
always

5954.88 --> 5961.56
loopholes [ __ ] loopholes loopholes

5958.0 --> 5961.56
ruin everything

5966.56 --> 5971.6
and hey you don't want to freaking pay

5968.719 --> 5974.8
taxes on anything fine

5971.6 --> 5974.8
go live in the woods

5975.679 --> 5980.2390000000005
you don't have to pay any taxes

5978.48 --> 5982.159
right you're gonna have to do everything

5980.239 --> 5985.159
else though why don't you deal with that

5982.159 --> 5985.159
[ __ ]

5996.88 --> 6001.76
i'd pay taxes

5998.96 --> 6006.28
to keep my environment clean

6001.76 --> 6006.280000000001
because that is my health insurance

6008.0 --> 6016.08
right hey or you could just

6010.719 --> 6016.08
choose to pay for health insurance

6016.4 --> 6020.48
yeah oh it's not a tax because you can

6019.28 --> 6022.5599999999995
choose

6020.48 --> 6024.4
yeah but if you don't

6022.56 --> 6026.639
in a toxic environment you know you're

6024.4 --> 6028.159
gonna die one day and you won't be able

6026.639 --> 6029.36
to pay the bills

6028.159 --> 6032.239
yeah

6029.36 --> 6033.759999999999
oh so that's not taxation then is it

6032.239 --> 6035.119
it's not

6033.76 --> 6037.76
huh huh

6035.119 --> 6041.0
or you just didn't think about it at all

6037.76 --> 6041.0
did you

6057.04 --> 6061.6
who needs government they want to

6059.28 --> 6064.599999999999
control us no

6061.6 --> 6064.6
no

6065.52 --> 6070.159000000001
government is us

6067.6 --> 6073.1990000000005
government is the people

6070.159 --> 6075.839999999999
but yeah when you have career

6073.199 --> 6078.32
government people like politicians

6075.84 --> 6080.96
yeah they do want to control us they

6078.32 --> 6083.599999999999
want to make it easier for them to

6080.96 --> 6083.6
govern us

6084.08 --> 6087.76
that's right

6085.92 --> 6089.92
and that's not necessarily a good thing

6087.76 --> 6091.4400000000005
it's not going to be helpful when they

6089.92 --> 6093.76
do that

6091.44 --> 6095.839999999999
that's why you make need to make sure

6093.76 --> 6097.6
that government doesn't grow out of

6095.84 --> 6099.4400000000005
control that it becomes too big that

6097.6 --> 6102.56
there are too many departments too much

6099.44 --> 6106.48
bureaucracy too many nene rules

6102.56 --> 6108.719
to elaborate a policy that's a bad thing

6106.48 --> 6110.159
that will actually kind of become

6108.719 --> 6111.76
communism

6110.159 --> 6113.92
because then

6111.76 --> 6116.639
the sheer amount of government and

6113.92 --> 6120.56
bureaucracy is going to be like a weapon

6116.639 --> 6122.4800000000005
against the people to pacify them

6120.56 --> 6124.56
so they won't be able to do anything

6122.48 --> 6127.28
about its size

6124.56 --> 6131.6
yeah that's the problem

6127.28 --> 6131.599999999999
government in itself is not the problem

6132.48 --> 6136.08
the system of government is a good

6134.48 --> 6138.0
system

6136.08 --> 6141.04
it's career

6138.0 --> 6143.199
politicians and their freaking psycho

6141.04 --> 6145.679
conspiracy [ __ ]

6143.199 --> 6146.839999999999
their little backhanded deals that's the

6145.679 --> 6149.6
problem

6146.84 --> 6152.2390000000005
corruption career

6149.6 --> 6154.400000000001
politicians are the problem

6152.239 --> 6157.5199999999995
not the government system the government

6154.4 --> 6157.5199999999995
system is people

6160.32 --> 6164.239
police

6161.44 --> 6164.239
is government

6165.28 --> 6169.92
sewage

6166.639 --> 6172.4800000000005
maintenance and garbage disposal is

6169.92 --> 6172.4800000000005
government

6174.88 --> 6178.96
what you want to

6176.56 --> 6181.119000000001
leave that all to corporations that are

6178.96 --> 6184.08
going to try to again

6181.119 --> 6186.639
by demand by the very nature of

6184.08 --> 6189.04
corporations try to make a profit out of

6186.639 --> 6193.36
it which will lead to corporatist

6189.04 --> 6195.6
manipulation of the [ __ ] scamming again

6193.36 --> 6197.199
or you could just leave it to government

6195.6 --> 6199.360000000001
and then everybody can complain about

6197.199 --> 6201.599999999999
the taxes but at least things are just

6199.36 --> 6201.599999999999
done

6201.92 --> 6207.119
if it's not too big a government

6204.639 --> 6209.4400000000005
because then nobody eventually checks up

6207.119 --> 6212.799999999999
on them if they even do their job right

6209.44 --> 6217.799999999999
it's a small government

6212.8 --> 6217.8
but a government not no government

6218.0 --> 6224.56
all right woodworking gunny bear

6221.36 --> 6224.5599999999995
yeah thanks for popping by

6230.96 --> 6235.44
government screws things up

6233.44 --> 6237.04
yeah that can happen

6235.44 --> 6239.839999999999
that's true

6237.04 --> 6243.36
but screw-ups in government

6239.84 --> 6245.360000000001
happen more the bigger the government is

6243.36 --> 6249.04
and the bigger the government is the

6245.36 --> 6250.48
more they will cover for each other

6249.04 --> 6252.159
right

6250.48 --> 6254.718999999999
they'll just become little friend

6252.159 --> 6256.32
politics if the government is too big

6254.719 --> 6258.719
that's why it's important to keep your

6256.32 --> 6261.04
government small

6258.719 --> 6263.28
but you need it if it's a small

6261.04 --> 6264.159
government then the people that are in

6263.28 --> 6266.5599999999995
it

6264.159 --> 6268.4
will be more held accountable

6266.56 --> 6270.719
they won't be able to cover for each

6268.4 --> 6272.5599999999995
other as easily

6270.719 --> 6275.6
so they will actually have to do their

6272.56 --> 6278.96
job right because it's a job

6275.6 --> 6280.719
being in government is a job

6278.96 --> 6283.44
you understand

6280.719 --> 6283.44
it's a job

6284.159 --> 6288.799999999999
and if that job becomes too easy

6286.719 --> 6291.52
because it's a big government then you

6288.8 --> 6292.639
get the career politicians that abuse

6291.52 --> 6294.0
that

6292.639 --> 6298.639
and start

6294.0 --> 6300.48
trying to get control over the people

6298.639 --> 6303.04
that's why you need a small government

6300.48 --> 6306.159
to prevent that from happening

6303.04 --> 6309.36
so you'll be able to more easily detect

6306.159 --> 6311.599999999999
career politicians and get rid of them

6309.36 --> 6313.839999999999
when they go sideways or corrupted on

6311.6 --> 6313.84
you

6314.84 --> 6320.88
yeah but you need government you'd

6317.679 --> 6320.88
absolutely need it

6323.84 --> 6326.400000000001
or it's going to be

6325.6 --> 6328.8
just

6326.4 --> 6331.44
anarchy and it might seem cool for a

6328.8 --> 6333.119000000001
while until somebody decides that they

6331.44 --> 6335.919999999999
are going to rule you and then who's

6333.119 --> 6335.92
going to stop him

6337.52 --> 6342.4800000000005
right

6338.48 --> 6345.5199999999995
anarchy always leads to autocracy always

6342.48 --> 6348.239
always always happens might be going

6345.52 --> 6350.0
right for a long time until it doesn't

6348.239 --> 6351.919999999999
and then somebody takes over that's sick

6350.0 --> 6353.36
of it and they are gonna like declare

6351.92 --> 6355.52
themselves king and it's gonna be

6353.36 --> 6357.759999999999
territy all over again

6355.52 --> 6360.2390000000005
it happens

6357.76 --> 6362.2390000000005
you need government

6360.239 --> 6364.718999999999
but keep it small

6362.239 --> 6366.0
so they can't go sideways on you as

6364.719 --> 6368.159
easily

6366.0 --> 6370.56
the bigger the government the more

6368.159 --> 6373.839999999999
easily they corrupt

6370.56 --> 6373.84
that's a fact

6378.56 --> 6384.1990000000005
all right i'll be back two minutes and

6380.159 --> 6384.199
then i'm gonna round out the show

6492.96 --> 6495.96
mm-hmm

6514.159 --> 6516.48
right

6516.88 --> 6520.8
while gaining wisdom it's complicated

6520.88 --> 6526.719
but yes in general when government

6523.52 --> 6528.080000000001
conspires with business corporations

6526.719 --> 6530.2390000000005
corporate model

6528.08 --> 6532.5599999999995
it becomes fascism but

6530.239 --> 6534.4
it really becomes fascism once the

6532.56 --> 6537.360000000001
government turns

6534.4 --> 6537.36
autocratic

6537.52 --> 6543.1990000000005
it's like the autocratic corporation

6540.719 --> 6544.8
cooperation between government and

6543.199 --> 6548.239
business

6544.8 --> 6551.76
and them aligning with the same goals

6548.239 --> 6555.839999999999
to gain control and exploit

6551.76 --> 6555.84
that's what makes it really fascism

6564.08 --> 6569.04
right but the thing is is that

6565.84 --> 6571.4400000000005
technically for most corporations always

6569.04 --> 6573.679
end up doing that anyway

6571.44 --> 6578.08
so it's dependent on how the government

6573.679 --> 6578.08
is whether it truly becomes fascism

6579.04 --> 6581.92
right

6579.92 --> 6584.88
corporations are always trying to get to

6581.92 --> 6587.119
people always trying to be popular or

6584.88 --> 6587.119
like

6587.36 --> 6594.159
set the trends etc

6591.28 --> 6596.639
make the big business

6594.159 --> 6599.04
that doesn't automatically empire imply

6596.639 --> 6602.0
fascism it's when the government kind of

6599.04 --> 6602.0
forces it all

6606.4 --> 6609.04
and like

6609.199 --> 6615.839999999999
basically forces decisions even on what

6612.08 --> 6615.84
businesses are used

6619.679 --> 6625.84
when they conspire with business yeah

6623.28 --> 6625.84
anyway

6636.4 --> 6641.759999999999
yeah i don't know pj khrushchev

6639.679 --> 6644.0
brandon is just kind of like out of the

6641.76 --> 6644.0
run

6644.08 --> 6649.04
maybe he'll pay back at some point but

6646.719 --> 6653.4
no guarantees you know maybe his job is

6649.04 --> 6653.4
like really working out for him

6653.52 --> 6657.599
i mean

6654.639 --> 6657.599
like yeah

6659.119 --> 6662.92
only time will tell

6682.0 --> 6687.28
dark water oh god yeah load coil i know

6684.56 --> 6687.280000000001
it's terrible

6691.28 --> 6696.4
but yeah those industries should be like

6697.04 --> 6702.08
not only made illegal is like those

6699.679 --> 6705.08
people should all be arrested and like

6702.08 --> 6705.08
persecuted

6718.4 --> 6722.08

6781.36 --> 6785.759999999999
debates we just now started up i just

6783.44 --> 6787.759999999999
got the notification

6785.76 --> 6789.84
so hope to see you there in chat

6787.76 --> 6792.0
great show again yeah today was a good

6789.84 --> 6793.28
show

6792.0 --> 6796.08
i got

6793.28 --> 6796.08
up and running

6796.48 --> 6801.04
pretty fast this time i'm very happy

6798.96 --> 6803.04
about yeah everything we discussed this

6801.04 --> 6806.719
is these are good subjects to talk about

6803.04 --> 6810.0
and necessary necessary to get a real

6806.719 --> 6812.56
clear scope on things because

6810.0 --> 6814.88
there's so much railroading

6812.56 --> 6817.04
and propaganda with all these subjects

6814.88 --> 6819.36
it's hard to

6817.04 --> 6822.0
get loose from that and actually make

6819.36 --> 6824.08
your own track with it it's becoming

6822.0 --> 6825.92
very difficult because there's just so

6824.08 --> 6830.0
much programming

6825.92 --> 6832.2390000000005
involved in those subjects for decades

6830.0 --> 6834.48
and that kind of like forces you to

6832.239 --> 6837.759999999999
think about those things in a certain

6834.48 --> 6840.718999999999
way which has been expressed in the chat

6837.76 --> 6841.92
blatantly so it's necessary to do that

6840.719 --> 6844.08
and i'm glad

6841.92 --> 6847.119
i have the opportunity and the ability

6844.08 --> 6850.0
to do that and a good crowd

6847.119 --> 6852.4
to be to partake in it so thank you all

6850.0 --> 6853.28
for being there

6852.4 --> 6854.638999999999
right

6853.28 --> 6856.159
uh

6854.639 --> 6858.32
yeah

6856.159 --> 6861.57
until the next video

6858.32 --> 6892.849999999999
keep it flat

6861.57 --> 6892.849999999999
[Music]
