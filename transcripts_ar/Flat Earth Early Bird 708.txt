it's monday and

80.56 --> 88.159
the weather is very restless

84.72 --> 91.03999999999999
a bit rainy but just

88.159 --> 92.72
this constant gale and yeah leaves all

91.04 --> 95.84
over the place like a lot of trees are

92.72 --> 95.84
now dropping their leaves

96.159 --> 103.28
and yeah surprisingly though it's

100.0 --> 105.119
not very cold so it's

103.28 --> 107.43900000000001
it's still kind of mild temperature but

105.119 --> 114.0
it just looks

107.439 --> 118.47899999999998
and it's like wet and just i don't know

114.0 --> 121.92
kind of like the egg

118.479 --> 121.92
a gray autumn day

122.079 --> 129.84
but i'm doing good uh

126.24 --> 132.56
i got green tea with me

129.84 --> 134.31900000000002
ah plain truth was first even before i

132.56 --> 138.239
said good morning

134.319 --> 141.51999999999998
uh brent m good to see you

138.239 --> 143.59900000000002
hope the rest follow soon

141.52 --> 145.44
some people had some notification issues

143.599 --> 148.48
yesterday and it didn't

145.44 --> 150.879
didn't see my show going live at all so

148.48 --> 150.879
i heard

151.36 --> 158.08
but anyway yeah i got up really early

155.599 --> 160.48
for my doing i guess uh what is it 11

158.08 --> 160.48000000000002
o'clock

160.56 --> 164.16
i had gotten up like several times

162.56 --> 166.879
before that

164.16 --> 168.239
and then like yeah i go to the toilet

166.879 --> 171.44
and

168.239 --> 174.8
i don't know go to bed

171.44 --> 177.519
again happens sometimes but

174.8 --> 177.92000000000002
yeah it just got up and at 11 o'clock

177.519 --> 179.84
and

177.92 --> 182.0
i maybe it's the weather maybe it's just

179.84 --> 184.08
kind of like the restlessness

182.0 --> 186.0
made woke me up or something i don't

184.08 --> 188.239
know what it is i don't feel tired

186.0 --> 188.239
though

190.56 --> 193.92000000000002
so i did have a good rest even though i

193.12 --> 198.56
didn't

193.92 --> 200.79999999999998
yeah i did still go to bed

198.56 --> 202.48
relatively late so apparently i just

200.8 --> 203.36
didn't need that much sleep it worked

202.48 --> 205.35999999999999
really well

203.36 --> 207.20000000000002
i did get really fatigued right before

205.36 --> 210.72000000000003
going to bed so i guess it just

207.2 --> 210.72
i just really slept well

216.08 --> 221.44000000000003
here we go again right and i did make

219.84 --> 223.84
plenty of notes yesterday

221.44 --> 223.84
plenty

225.76 --> 229.44
there was all kinds of things around

231.519 --> 235.439
i watched a big chunk of

238.08 --> 244.64000000000001
oh right uh

241.84 --> 246.4
yeah there was this joe rogan alex jones

244.64 --> 248.79899999999998
postcast

246.4 --> 250.159
and i just wanted to look into that

248.799 --> 254.31900000000002
because they were

250.159 --> 258.0
there was like this play thing going on

254.319 --> 260.32
like what joe's trying to accomplish and

258.0 --> 261.12
what alex is trying to accomplish so it

260.32 --> 264.24
was almost

261.12 --> 267.04
a sort of like a wizard off in a way

264.24 --> 269.84000000000003
even though it was all about kuronu just

267.04 --> 269.84000000000003
just that

270.4 --> 276.479
and the elitists and everything

273.44 --> 278.479
but yeah it was still

276.479 --> 280.8
just interesting enough to make mention

278.479 --> 280.8
of it

281.6 --> 285.28000000000003
but i haven't finished it oh yeah i

283.28 --> 287.28
don't know at like two thirds i kind of

285.28 --> 289.67999999999995
started to get like okay i think i get

287.28 --> 292.71999999999997
it now it's just getting

289.68 --> 297.199
slightly monotonous here

292.72 --> 301.199
uh yeah big bear was also alive

297.199 --> 301.199
own benjamin was pretty awesome

302.72 --> 309.44000000000005
something fishy in denmark

306.32 --> 314.4
and yeah that ufc guy

309.44 --> 314.4
he showed that the ufc testimony video

316.479 --> 319.59999999999997
and you have seen it other people have

318.479 --> 323.12
shown it to uh

319.6 --> 325.84000000000003
since then or around that time but

323.12 --> 327.36
it was good pretty awesome interesting

325.84 --> 331.11999999999995
guy

327.36 --> 333.039
uh right and he had like this whole

331.12 --> 335.44
piece eventually start putting yeah this

333.039 --> 336.88
concept of just focusing on thomas

335.44 --> 339.68
jefferson that

336.88 --> 341.039
supposedly he was like a sort of a deist

339.68 --> 343.84000000000003
or something

341.039 --> 345.68
and it's i don't know i thought it was

343.84 --> 348.32
an interesting perspective

345.68 --> 350.0
and that was never really highlighted to

348.32 --> 352.639
me before

350.0 --> 353.36
about thomas jefferson but it makes it

352.639 --> 356.40000000000003
even more

353.36 --> 359.52000000000004
interesting it's like

356.4 --> 361.35999999999996
there's more to learn about him

359.52 --> 362.71999999999997
about what was going on what like what

361.36 --> 365.44
were they really

362.72 --> 366.759
doing you know what were they really

365.44 --> 371.6
doing and then yeah the

366.759 --> 374.72
tartarian situation as well and so

371.6 --> 376.0
yeah we get the story stories in line

374.72 --> 379.6
with a certain method

376.0 --> 384.479
a certain ideal but

379.6 --> 386.88
yeah there was probably even more to it

384.479 --> 387.52
and there was probably also some occult

386.88 --> 390.56
stuff and

387.52 --> 394.88
everything i i don't know it's

390.56 --> 396.72
it's very popular in some circles

394.88 --> 398.319
i've always found it very interesting

396.72 --> 401.91900000000004
too

398.319 --> 403.91900000000004
like flat earth and tartaria kind of

401.919 --> 406.56
sort of

403.919 --> 408.0
took some out of it but it's still i

406.56 --> 410.88
still find it there's more

408.0 --> 412.639
to it there's there's more i find it

410.88 --> 416.639
interesting anyway

412.639 --> 419.039
pretty good stream at owen benjamin's uh

416.639 --> 421.759
oh yeah i had a very long skype call

419.039 --> 424.15999999999997
with robin stanley again

421.759 --> 427.91900000000004
basically yeah it's now sort of settled

424.16 --> 432.72
in the new situation and gave a report

427.919 --> 432.71999999999997
and we just talked about living

433.12 --> 439.52
and about my show how that's going and

436.4 --> 441.19899999999996
oh yeah about my well my wood potential

439.52 --> 442.639
would have been girlfriend that

441.199 --> 445.28000000000003
yeah that that didn't work out

442.639 --> 445.28000000000003
unfortunately

445.599 --> 449.68
i think i explained that yesterday it

448.16 --> 452.639
was a real bummer

449.68 --> 454.0
but yeah anyway i'm not letting it bog

452.639 --> 456.56
me down or anything

454.0 --> 458.24
it's just like oh very typical like it

456.56 --> 460.4
seems like it's gonna and then like

458.24 --> 463.199
immediately the next day it's just

460.4 --> 465.84
bang no more contact possibility oh

463.199 --> 465.84000000000003
goody

466.479 --> 469.84
but who knows if it was meant to be then

469.28 --> 474.0
it'll

469.84 --> 477.039
come back that's how i look at it

474.0 --> 481.759
hey amanda young i killed the hope

477.039 --> 481.759
cameron gilmore rob h michael jones

487.199 --> 493.84000000000003
uh i think i pretty much went then

490.639 --> 493.84000000000003
went through the whole thing now

498.479 --> 507.84
wasn't there anything else

511.199 --> 514.32
oh right yeah yeah they're really woke

512.8 --> 516.959
show too again

514.32 --> 516.9590000000001
roxanne

517.599 --> 522.399
it was like a group effort it was about

520.719 --> 525.2
the covet situation

522.399 --> 527.2
and about also especially this letter

525.2 --> 530.24
sent to trump by this

527.2 --> 533.36
cardinal and there was like a

530.24 --> 535.92
really well written letter

533.36 --> 538.32
that was quite to the point and yeah

535.92 --> 541.4399999999999
they made it about that

538.32 --> 543.9200000000001
and they even like re-upload it as

541.44 --> 545.2
yeah no without the hangout just that

543.92 --> 547.519
part

545.2 --> 548.32
and that's interesting so i recommend

547.519 --> 550.9590000000001
you

548.32 --> 550.9590000000001
check it out

552.16 --> 556.24
hold on maybe i'll link it in chat

561.68 --> 568.4799999999999
it's right one it's like 11 minutes long

564.8 --> 568.4799999999999
some of you may have already seen that

568.88 --> 572.72
but this yeah this is basic it's not

570.88 --> 575.8389999999999
very readable because it's very

572.72 --> 579.36
zoomed out but they

575.839 --> 579.36
yeah the guy reads it out

579.519 --> 582.72
and he does so pretty well

583.2 --> 589.279
so uh right yeah it was a

586.959 --> 590.0
pretty pretty awesome letter very i

589.279 --> 591.04
didn't even go

590.0 --> 593.12
through it all but just the

591.04 --> 596.88
preliminaries of it already gave me like

593.12 --> 599.76
whoa this is serious

596.88 --> 601.68
this is like there's some real energy

599.76 --> 603.519
going on in there

601.68 --> 605.68
now whether it will actually be

603.519 --> 607.839
successful or whether this is just like

605.68 --> 607.8389999999999
a

608.079 --> 613.519
like a symbolic signal like

611.279 --> 614.72
so that it has been established that it

613.519 --> 618.9590000000001
has been attempted

614.72 --> 621.6800000000001
and set you know this is complicated

618.959 --> 623.5189999999999
put potential covert diplomacy going on

621.68 --> 626.959
here you don't know with these things

623.519 --> 628.5600000000001
you know but as for

626.959 --> 633.8389999999999
what it just seemed to be very

628.56 --> 633.8389999999999
straightforward very logos

633.92 --> 637.1999999999999
and yeah that was just good

637.44 --> 642.6400000000001
good to take note of that talking about

640.56 --> 647.8389999999999
a letter from a cardinal i linked it

642.64 --> 647.8389999999999
in the chat emblem

651.44 --> 655.36
because link.org oh well i think they'll

654.72 --> 661.839
probably

655.36 --> 661.839
link to that let me double check hey

667.04 --> 669.92
no wait

671.92 --> 677.92
okay uh here we go again if you got that

676.64 --> 680.8
link

677.92 --> 681.279
by chance you can oh yeah i got a wrench

680.8 --> 682.8
so

681.279 --> 689.8389999999999
that would be cool if you would post

682.8 --> 689.8389999999999
that so people can actually read it too

690.32 --> 694.88
although i do literally have the pdf

693.2 --> 698.32
file

694.88 --> 698.32
because tony gave it to me

698.72 --> 703.839
but yeah i can't literally dump that in

700.839 --> 703.839
chat

709.279 --> 713.519
and also i don't feel like oh this is

711.6 --> 714.5600000000001
such a good letter i'm gonna read it out

713.519 --> 718.399
and then

714.56 --> 720.079
make it rub off on me no no no i i do

718.399 --> 722.24
there's gonna be plenty of people doing

720.079 --> 722.2399999999999
it

728.839 --> 732.639
ah great thank you for that and here we

731.839 --> 736.1600000000001
go again

732.639 --> 745.839
a link in chat so do check it out

736.16 --> 745.8389999999999
if you haven't already seen it

751.44 --> 756.32
yeah and bo look if you don't want to

754.079 --> 758.56
then don't

756.32 --> 759.9200000000001
or you could perhaps just copy the link

758.56 --> 762.56
and i don't know

759.92 --> 763.1999999999999
save it in a text file or whatever you

762.56 --> 766.3199999999999
know it's

763.2 --> 773.839
just a computer

766.32 --> 773.839
it's a computer right

785.279 --> 788.88
anyway yeah how are you guys doing it i

787.36 --> 791.6
pretty much went through the list pretty

788.88 --> 791.6
rapidly here

796.16 --> 801.8389999999999
did not watch my show back yesterday

802.32 --> 807.839
but i think it was pretty uh that i had

804.639 --> 807.839
some good moments here and there

809.2 --> 815.839
from what i can remember but yeah i

810.959 --> 815.8389999999999
don't really remember what it was

818.399 --> 829.839
hey julio papin good to see you

837.68 --> 843.3599999999999
oh wait yesterday was i think i banned

840.48 --> 845.36
mr jones

843.36 --> 847.279
i think that was what happened yesterday

845.36 --> 850.72
right

847.279 --> 852.399
i think it was about atheism

850.72 --> 854.48
they were yeah they were basically

852.399 --> 856.0
disrespecting the bible at some point

854.48 --> 858.72
you know like if you don't believe

856.0 --> 858.72
it okay

859.04 --> 863.36
i've been there at some point from a

862.24 --> 866.0
certain perspective

863.36 --> 866.639
but that doesn't mean you're just gonna

866.0 --> 870.16
[ __ ]

866.639 --> 873.199
on it you know you can

870.16 --> 876.56
call people fools perhaps for like

873.199 --> 878.24
following some mistaken so for making a

876.56 --> 881.5189999999999
mistake they pinpointed

878.24 --> 884.16
you know but to just

881.519 --> 885.12
throw the whole thing on on the garbage

884.16 --> 887.8389999999999
pile like that

885.12 --> 889.6
and the people with it that's just

887.839 --> 892.32
that's just nasty

889.6 --> 894.639
especially because there are people here

892.32 --> 895.44
that have the bible very close to their

894.639 --> 899.519
heart

895.44 --> 901.839
like for yeah

899.519 --> 903.12
by my own recommendations maybe a little

901.839 --> 906.1600000000001
too close

903.12 --> 912.9590000000001
but they do so yeah that's just

906.16 --> 915.279
very rude

912.959 --> 917.4399999999999
that's not behavior that will lead to

915.279 --> 917.4399999999999
just

917.839 --> 922.32
yeah to a constructive conversation it's

920.399 --> 926.16
just gonna trigger people

922.32 --> 928.32
and at the same time i try

926.16 --> 929.279
to pay attention that people in my chat

928.32 --> 932.88
don't go too

929.279 --> 935.8389999999999
far with even the ridiculing of atheism

932.88 --> 936.88
or believing the ball like sometimes

935.839 --> 938.72
happens in

936.88 --> 940.56
in chats and over at the flat earth

938.72 --> 943.0400000000001
debates some people are like

940.56 --> 943.68
really on the attack they're pretty

943.04 --> 946.8
rough

943.68 --> 949.279
well i don't appreciate that

946.8 --> 952.4799999999999
even though yeah i might find it amusing

949.279 --> 952.48
at times over there

952.839 --> 958.8800000000001
but right

954.959 --> 962.16
not over here because i want people to

958.88 --> 964.399
learn stuff learn from their differences

962.16 --> 964.399
too

966.839 --> 972.8800000000001
right hey samson

970.0 --> 973.199
i don't even know that's what that is

972.88 --> 976.0
but

973.199 --> 976.0
samson hi

978.56 --> 983.8389999999999
is that hebrew or something behind your

981.04 --> 983.8389999999999
name

990.48 --> 995.1990000000001
frontward and backward here english okay

995.839 --> 998.1600000000001
okay

1008.0 --> 1018.48
so it's like hebrew

1012.56 --> 1018.4799999999999
nos mas is that what it's saying

1019.36 --> 1027.1200000000001
oh hero reads right

1022.88 --> 1039.839
to the left all right that's weird

1027.12 --> 1039.839
i didn't even realize that

1045.43 --> 1049.249
[Music]

1063.28 --> 1069.25
right so anyway welcome to the chat

1067.44 --> 1072.339
uh

1069.25 --> 1072.339
[Music]

1072.4 --> 1076.0800000000002
okay let's wake up look up i've been

1075.6 --> 1081.84
already

1076.08 --> 1081.84
like awake for three hours

1084.4 --> 1088.0800000000002
i know i i don't know i feel

1086.0 --> 1090.64
surprisingly restful

1088.08 --> 1092.559
and it's like all windy over the place

1090.64 --> 1097.66
and i just feel like pretty mellow

1092.559 --> 1099.2
i don't know so again this weird around

1097.66 --> 1102.24
[Music]

1099.2 --> 1104.4
halloween time it's always different for

1102.24 --> 1104.4
me

1105.44 --> 1110.64
i think it is a real letter what

1112.88 --> 1119.0390000000002
yeah rob h mr jones was kind of always

1116.08 --> 1121.039
pushing it a little but he just seemed

1119.039 --> 1122.8799999999999
to have lost his patience and it was

1121.039 --> 1124.32
only going to grow worse and he was just

1122.88 --> 1127.44
turning into a complete

1124.32 --> 1137.84
full baller troll and yeah i'm not going

1127.44 --> 1137.8400000000001
to stand for that

1150.559 --> 1156.08
wow well emball why would you think it's

1153.12 --> 1156.08
not a real letter

1156.88 --> 1165.8400000000001
what a weird thing to say

1167.12 --> 1174.3999999999999
to americanized well perhaps that's

1170.88 --> 1178.0
because it's being written to

1174.4 --> 1181.52
an american hello

1178.0 --> 1184.72
as i said the guy who wrote that

1181.52 --> 1187.44
just shows a lot of skill

1184.72 --> 1189.3600000000001
in speech in getting a message across

1187.44 --> 1192.88
he's very eloquent so

1189.36 --> 1194.7199999999998
he's probably adapted the message to be

1192.88 --> 1196.48
somewhat americanized because it's

1194.72 --> 1198.72
addressing trump

1196.48 --> 1198.72
see

1205.2 --> 1209.2
it sounds logical if you're trying to

1207.36 --> 1211.76
get a message across yeah while

1209.2 --> 1213.039
adapting a little to their vernacular

1211.76 --> 1215.28
and way of thinking

1213.039 --> 1216.8799999999999
tends to kind of help getting the

1215.28 --> 1221.84
message across

1216.88 --> 1221.8400000000001
it's only logical

1228.159 --> 1231.5200000000002
who wrote it uh some

1231.84 --> 1238.24
some cardinal i don't know where where

1235.52 --> 1238.24
was he from

1238.799 --> 1241.28
let's see

1242.72 --> 1251.84
alright bishop vigano

1248.0 --> 1251.84
from i don't know

1253.039 --> 1255.76
where is he

1260.88 --> 1263.8400000000001
is he from the vatican

1265.28 --> 1267.9189999999999
form wait

1270.64 --> 1276.96
so of the united states okay so he is he

1273.679 --> 1280.0800000000002
is an american

1276.96 --> 1284.559
so he's an american

1280.08 --> 1284.559
catholic in america i guess

1284.88 --> 1291.8400000000001
from from the link that i got

1288.24 --> 1291.84
from here we go again

1297.36 --> 1300.559
bishop to america

1302.96 --> 1309.72
so he was did he live in the vatican

1306.64 --> 1312.5590000000002
and was he like the vatican

1309.72 --> 1313.6000000000001
representative to america or something

1312.559 --> 1315.6
like that

1313.6 --> 1317.039
or was he an actual american i don't

1315.6 --> 1320.1589999999999
know man i'm just

1317.039 --> 1322.0
i'm just fishing a little

1320.159 --> 1324.4
doesn't necessarily even matter to me

1322.0 --> 1327.039
but head of the catholic church

1324.4 --> 1327.039
in america

1328.0 --> 1333.84
so he lived in america was he a born

1331.36 --> 1333.84
american

1335.6 --> 1339.039
i don't think he is right okay okay well

1338.0 --> 1342.159
that was kind of

1339.039 --> 1345.679
i guess the question or the

1342.159 --> 1347.679
the the issue that embal had like why

1345.679 --> 1349.8400000000001
does it sound so american well maybe

1347.679 --> 1351.76
because he wrote to an american or yeah

1349.84 --> 1352.559
in this case maybe because he is an

1351.76 --> 1356.4
american

1352.559 --> 1356.3999999999999
so yeah that would explain wouldn't it

1357.12 --> 1362.4799999999998
but either way i don't really see the

1360.159 --> 1362.48
issue

1362.58 --> 1365.71
[Music]

1372.84 --> 1375.84
hmm

1381.93 --> 1386.4
[Music]

1383.36 --> 1390.799
he's italian okay so he's literally

1386.4 --> 1390.799
like a vatican resident

1393.28 --> 1398.6399999999999
emmanuel aviles or afiles

1396.72 --> 1403.84
you still haven't informed me how to

1398.64 --> 1403.8400000000001
pronounce your name

1410.65 --> 1413.689
[Music]

1414.84 --> 1417.84
so

1429.33 --> 1432.3799999999999
[Music]

1436.08 --> 1439.1999999999998
just call you manny

1442.72 --> 1446.559
but i typically just like to read out

1445.679 --> 1448.72
the name

1446.559 --> 1450.48
and hopefully get it right so that's why

1448.72 --> 1458.4
i'm asking and with you i have

1450.48 --> 1461.1200000000001
some doubt

1458.4 --> 1462.64
or is it with a silent s like french is

1461.12 --> 1473.6599999999999
it avile

1462.64 --> 1474.88
i don't know i just want to know this

1473.66 --> 1478.159
[Music]

1474.88 --> 1481.44
so it's obvious like uh

1478.159 --> 1484.159
spanish or silent as french

1481.44 --> 1484.8400000000001
which one well you're called manuel so

1484.159 --> 1487.2
that

1484.84 --> 1487.84
probably will be in the direction of

1487.2 --> 1501.8400000000001
spanish

1487.84 --> 1504.799
or mediterranean at least right

1501.84 --> 1506.559
mexican ah all right so it's manuel

1504.799 --> 1509.2
aviles

1506.559 --> 1510.3999999999999
excellent now i know exactly how this

1509.2 --> 1514.96
how to say your name

1510.4 --> 1529.8400000000001
thank you

1514.96 --> 1529.8400000000001
right yeah welcome

1530.72 --> 1536.159
cool ah right we're talking about that

1533.6 --> 1536.1589999999999
letter right

1536.24 --> 1541.039
i don't know what that means but he is

1537.84 --> 1544.6399999999999
an archbishop one archbishop

1541.039 --> 1544.64
that's like in the priesthood

1545.52 --> 1551.52
ranking it's archbishop is like the

1548.64 --> 1551.5200000000002
highest rank

1552.08 --> 1557.77
under the pope so it's like yeah

1555.44 --> 1560.88
well the archbishop

1557.77 --> 1560.8799999999999
[Music]

1561.2 --> 1565.44
the archmage you could potentially

1563.84 --> 1567.52
consider it but this

1565.44 --> 1569.679
seems like a good guy but yeah i don't

1567.52 --> 1571.84
know him he's very good at writing that

1569.679 --> 1571.8400000000001
letter

1578.559 --> 1585.84
vegano really

1585.919 --> 1595.2
he was accused of it was he also

1590.32 --> 1595.2
convicted their actual confirmation

1597.039 --> 1600.1589999999999
you know i can't imagine look this is

1599.44 --> 1603.6000000000001
how dark

1600.159 --> 1606.0800000000002
that [ __ ] usually ends up working

1603.6 --> 1607.6
people that actually do that [ __ ] tend

1606.08 --> 1610.24
to have

1607.6 --> 1610.7199999999998
system going in blackmail to ensure that

1610.24 --> 1613.919
they

1610.72 --> 1616.08
do get away with it and then

1613.919 --> 1617.279
often they do frame people that don't

1616.08 --> 1619.84
actually do it

1617.279 --> 1620.64
because they are coming after them for

1619.84 --> 1623.9189999999999
doing it

1620.64 --> 1625.6000000000001
see it's that [ __ ] happens in movies all

1623.919 --> 1627.6000000000001
the time as well

1625.6 --> 1629.039
and yeah that's problematic because it

1627.6 --> 1631.279
it yeah

1629.039 --> 1632.24
they do definitely try that in the real

1631.279 --> 1634.88
world as well so

1632.24 --> 1636.159
just because they are accused does not

1634.88 --> 1639.0390000000002
necessarily mean that

1636.159 --> 1641.6000000000001
they have actually done anything could

1639.039 --> 1645.12
have been framed

1641.6 --> 1647.279
but i don't know the details so

1645.12 --> 1648.32
who knows maybe he did actually do

1647.279 --> 1650.64
something like that

1648.32 --> 1655.84
that still doesn't take away that it was

1650.64 --> 1655.8400000000001
a very eloquently written letter

1662.32 --> 1667.6
he didn't okay okay

1665.6 --> 1669.9189999999999
i'm just i'm talking hypothetical you

1667.6 --> 1672.1589999999999
know because

1669.919 --> 1674.3200000000002
that yeah if he was accused that is

1672.159 --> 1678.24
noteworthy one way or the other

1674.32 --> 1680.84
because either way you know

1678.24 --> 1683.84
it's very polarizing when that happens

1680.84 --> 1683.84
so

1684.72 --> 1687.84
in either a good or a bad way that's why

1687.279 --> 1690.88
i

1687.84 --> 1690.8799999999999
inquired further

1692.32 --> 1697.84
yeah yeah this tuesday is gonna be wacky

1699.84 --> 1705.1499999999999
still wacky tuesday

1702.05 --> 1705.1499999999999
[Music]

1709.36 --> 1712.8799999999999
there's gonna be a lot of champagne and

1711.52 --> 1714.8799999999999
a lot of crying

1712.88 --> 1717.2
and probably also a lot of beer no

1714.88 --> 1720.5590000000002
matter what

1717.2 --> 1723.52
yeah i i just hope

1720.559 --> 1724.0
it's not gonna turn in like as nutty as

1723.52 --> 1727.039
like

1724.0 --> 1729.12
when obama got elected

1727.039 --> 1730.96
god well that probably never would

1729.12 --> 1733.36
happen the chemistry is not there like

1730.96 --> 1733.3600000000001
that but

1735.2 --> 1739.8400000000001
is there's things are gonna happen

1740.24 --> 1745.919
as i said i'm calling it wacky it's

1743.6 --> 1747.76
a little more dark than that probably

1745.919 --> 1752.48
but it's still gonna get pretty

1747.76 --> 1755.57
pretty wacky out there

1752.48 --> 1759.67
like the real halloween

1755.57 --> 1759.6699999999998
[Music]

1763.76 --> 1770.32
right oh man by the way ah no i don't

1767.44 --> 1770.3200000000002
even want to bring it up

1771.44 --> 1775.8400000000001
but i'm like seeing some pop-up titles

1774.48 --> 1778.64
that apparently like

1775.84 --> 1780.08
ugh kamala harris which i know very

1778.64 --> 1780.7990000000002
little of except that she's like a

1780.08 --> 1783.4399999999998
frontrunner

1780.799 --> 1786.799
democrats that she's like really

1783.44 --> 1790.72
throwing out the marxism now

1786.799 --> 1795.84
like to

1790.72 --> 1795.84
creepy levels

1796.399 --> 1802.1589999999999
thought that was like what really

1799.84 --> 1803.039
so is there really are there just enough

1802.159 --> 1805.5200000000002
people

1803.039 --> 1806.24
out there that are just surrendered to

1805.52 --> 1808.1589999999999
this [ __ ]

1806.24 --> 1810.559
that they really don't care anymore if

1808.159 --> 1810.5590000000002
it's just

1811.279 --> 1820.0
like way we are the hostile

1814.72 --> 1820.0
rebels rebels right

1820.96 --> 1824.08
ugh i just

1826.88 --> 1830.5590000000002
like things like that like we have some

1829.679 --> 1833.76
pretty

1830.559 --> 1837.52
tenacious leftists over here like well

1833.76 --> 1840.399
tenacious liberals because

1837.52 --> 1841.12
they really left this not really very

1840.399 --> 1843.6
tenacious

1841.12 --> 1844.799
yeah grappler types and all kinds of

1843.6 --> 1848.0
types

1844.799 --> 1851.84
but they never get like that like that

1848.0 --> 1851.84
would be just like what

1853.84 --> 1857.36
because in the netherlands we get a lot

1855.36 --> 1859.84
more nitpicky on our politicians and

1857.36 --> 1859.84
what they do

1860.88 --> 1868.159
and not just straight out blah blah

1864.08 --> 1868.1589999999999
blah media slander non-stop

1868.88 --> 1873.7600000000002
although people do try to work in as

1871.84 --> 1874.8799999999999
much as they can you know but it's more

1873.76 --> 1878.799
sneaky

1874.88 --> 1881.919
over here compared to the united states

1878.799 --> 1884.1589999999999
but that's just yeah kamala cackles a

1881.919 --> 1884.159
lot

1884.48 --> 1892.559
well anyway so do i sometimes you know

1888.0 --> 1894.96
but she yeah she's really going for

1892.559 --> 1894.96
like a

1897.36 --> 1904.4799999999998
for like a hillary a black hillary 2.0

1901.44 --> 1907.8400000000001
something situation she's really getting

1904.48 --> 1907.84
just like

1911.039 --> 1913.44
sick

1915.919 --> 1921.2
yeah yeah of course it's theater but

1919.36 --> 1923.36
yeah just because it's theater doesn't

1921.2 --> 1925.6000000000001
mean that they're not going that far and

1923.36 --> 1928.4799999999998
it's not going to have consequences even

1925.6 --> 1929.9189999999999
a direct reflection on yourself you know

1928.48 --> 1933.1200000000001
because

1929.919 --> 1936.96
consequences are pretty real

1933.12 --> 1937.5189999999998
still to the people the influence that

1936.96 --> 1942.08
it has

1937.519 --> 1942.08
on some people that's pretty real

1942.24 --> 1945.2
so just because we're not affected

1943.84 --> 1946.84
doesn't mean that nobody's gonna be

1945.2 --> 1950.72
affected

1946.84 --> 1950.72
unfortunately ugh

1950.91 --> 1955.1200000000001
[Music]

1952.96 --> 1962.81
kamala cackles way more than hillary

1955.12 --> 1970.0189999999998
even yes probably

1962.81 --> 1970.019
[Music]

1973.519 --> 1976.72
is there any dear who is likely to win

1976.32 --> 1980.559
or

1976.72 --> 1982.96
too close to call well i have no doubt

1980.559 --> 1984.08
that by any legitimate standards trump

1982.96 --> 1987.1200000000001
will win

1984.08 --> 1990.399
no doubt but

1987.12 --> 1992.559
on the other hand it's just

1990.399 --> 1993.6
i have no doubt that there will be

1992.559 --> 1997.44
rigging

1993.6 --> 2001.6
and like really weird [ __ ] like

1997.44 --> 2006.24
they will try to basically frame rake

2001.6 --> 2008.1589999999999
trump people i i presume

2006.24 --> 2010.24
that they might try that as well so it

2008.159 --> 2012.48
might get very confusing and weird and

2010.24 --> 2013.279
it's going to be the most contested

2012.48 --> 2016.96
election

2013.279 --> 2019.76
in american history this is just never

2016.96 --> 2021.44
gonna end

2019.76 --> 2023.2
like if you thought that they were kind

2021.44 --> 2025.3600000000001
of whining last time

2023.2 --> 2026.3990000000001
about whoa trump is not a legitimate

2025.36 --> 2029.4399999999998
present well

2026.399 --> 2030.8799999999999
you haven't seen anything yet boys and

2029.44 --> 2034.48
girls

2030.88 --> 2037.6000000000001
this they m they might literally just go

2034.48 --> 2040.08
into this weird acting situation

2037.6 --> 2041.279
where they will literally try to ignore

2040.08 --> 2044.08
him if he wins

2041.279 --> 2046.32
and just push him out of the way and

2044.08 --> 2047.84
then let the democrats just take their

2046.32 --> 2048.639
place even though it doesn't make any

2047.84 --> 2052.0
sense

2048.639 --> 2052.0
it might go that far

2052.32 --> 2055.839
at least i can conceive it might go that

2054.399 --> 2058.0
far i don't know if it actually got

2055.839 --> 2061.119
there for they would be just too nutty

2058.0 --> 2064.96
really at this point

2061.119 --> 2067.52
but they'll try anything

2064.96 --> 2067.52
they will

2068.879 --> 2072.24
can you just imagine the idea you know

2070.96 --> 2075.2
it's not gonna happen

2072.24 --> 2076.3199999999997
it's very unlikely but that like oh yeah

2075.2 --> 2079.2799999999997
trump won

2076.32 --> 2080.079
of course duh and then ah they're all

2079.28 --> 2084.159
gonna

2080.079 --> 2086.32
no no moments and all that

2084.159 --> 2088.2400000000002
and then it's gonna be like no no we

2086.32 --> 2088.639
have one it's a fraud it's a fraud and

2088.24 --> 2090.72
then

2088.639 --> 2092.3990000000003
media has just got to go like oh yeah of

2090.72 --> 2094.879
course trump fronted and

2092.399 --> 2095.839
yeah we're sending the investigators and

2094.879 --> 2098.0789999999997
of course

2095.839 --> 2099.92
and then now yeah we we're gonna have to

2098.079 --> 2102.2400000000002
rule the country somehow so

2099.92 --> 2104.64
yeah i vote like some kind of weird

2102.24 --> 2106.56
media based idea vote publicly we're

2104.64 --> 2108.16
gonna have a second vote just like that

2106.56 --> 2109.68
out of nowhere it's not even gonna be a

2108.16 --> 2111.1189999999997
real vote just gonna be

2109.68 --> 2113.2
saying there's a vote and then yeah

2111.119 --> 2115.599
everybody agrees yeah yeah

2113.2 --> 2117.04
the kamala harris or biden whatever is

2115.599 --> 2118.6400000000003
the real president and they're just

2117.04 --> 2121.839
gonna have like

2118.64 --> 2124.4
weirdo police like

2121.839 --> 2126.64
figures thugs that are just going to

2124.4 --> 2127.76
basically try to replace the whole thing

2126.64 --> 2131.839
and they're just gonna push

2127.76 --> 2131.8390000000004
everybody out of the way like no

2132.32 --> 2136.1600000000003
and then who knows might even yeah get

2134.96 --> 2139.04
points where there will be like

2136.16 --> 2141.68
shoot-offs between the

2139.04 --> 2142.24
secret service or protection of the the

2141.68 --> 2144.72
trump

2142.24 --> 2145.359
people and the president himself maybe

2144.72 --> 2148.0
and them

2145.359 --> 2150.16
who knows how far that will go i i don't

2148.0 --> 2151.68
know maybe they'll have a retreat plan

2150.16 --> 2152.72
and then they'll come back later i don't

2151.68 --> 2155.9199999999996
know what's gonna happen

2152.72 --> 2159.839
but it could go pretty nutty

2155.92 --> 2159.839
yeah wild wild speculation

2160.079 --> 2163.28
but when it comes down to just the

2162.24 --> 2166.3199999999997
honest

2163.28 --> 2170.0
election whatever will be left there

2166.32 --> 2173.3590000000004
buried under the giant pile of craziness

2170.0 --> 2174.96
it's just almost unimaginable that

2173.359 --> 2176.4
anybody but trump would win at this

2174.96 --> 2180.7200000000003
point

2176.4 --> 2182.8
it's just he put in too much effort

2180.72 --> 2185.04
you know he's he hasn't been perfect but

2182.8 --> 2187.6800000000003
he's just done too much connected with

2185.04 --> 2189.68
too much people

2187.68 --> 2191.7599999999998
huge amounts of mistakes but even that

2189.68 --> 2194.48
just doesn't even matter anymore

2191.76 --> 2194.88
to those people because they themselves

2194.48 --> 2196.88
too

2194.88 --> 2198.48
feel like the world is going crazy so

2196.88 --> 2200.4
then they wouldn't

2198.48 --> 2202.48
be that outrage that the president would

2200.4 --> 2203.04
be going crazy as well like that see and

2202.48 --> 2205.2
then it's

2203.04 --> 2207.359
very easy to just take the apologetic

2205.2 --> 2209.359
route and and just look at like yeah

2207.359 --> 2211.359
trump compared to everything else is

2209.359 --> 2212.96
just like ah

2211.359 --> 2214.61
anything else would just destroy

2212.96 --> 2217.649
everything so

2214.61 --> 2217.6490000000003
[Music]

2220.32 --> 2229.839
like and who else would be the better

2222.64 --> 2229.839
option really

2230.24 --> 2235.2
except for maybe ron paul but i don't

2232.4 --> 2235.2000000000003
think he's running

2237.52 --> 2241.2
nor does he probably have the stomach to

2239.839 --> 2243.44
face the media

2241.2 --> 2245.7599999999998
because it would then go absolutely

2243.44 --> 2250.16
ballistic like it has on trump on him

2245.76 --> 2251.76
and he knows that he's an old an old guy

2250.16 --> 2253.2799999999997
well yeah it doesn't really matter but

2251.76 --> 2257.8390000000004
he's just too mild for that

2253.28 --> 2257.8390000000004
he knows that

2260.32 --> 2264.6400000000003
unless things just calm down eventually

2262.72 --> 2266.16
you know who knows it sounds really

2264.64 --> 2266.8799999999997
weird but maybe ron paul could even

2266.16 --> 2270.0789999999997
potentially

2266.88 --> 2272.48
be president still in the future if just

2270.079 --> 2274.5600000000004
the situation changed and it just wasn't

2272.48 --> 2276.56
so much

2274.56 --> 2277.7599999999998
nuisance going on but it's a little

2276.56 --> 2280.24
calmer

2277.76 --> 2281.0400000000004
a little bit more controlled the media

2280.24 --> 2283.1189999999997
if the media

2281.04 --> 2284.64
at some point could ever be more under

2283.119 --> 2288.0
control

2284.64 --> 2288.0
could it i don't know

2289.119 --> 2291.359
right

2292.72 --> 2298.24
you have worried about trump for five

2294.88 --> 2302.6400000000003
years yeah

2298.24 --> 2307.9199999999996
well the mainstream media is just like a

2302.64 --> 2307.92
yeah a corporate mercenary arm

2308.8 --> 2312.7200000000003
that have a contract with the liberal

2311.359 --> 2315.44
politics

2312.72 --> 2315.9199999999996
the democratic party so they are just

2315.44 --> 2318.8
doing

2315.92 --> 2319.28
like a mercenary service basically for

2318.8 --> 2320.8
them

2319.28 --> 2322.7200000000003
and they have for some while and they

2320.8 --> 2325.8390000000004
have absolutely no

2322.72 --> 2328.9599999999996
plan to really change

2325.839 --> 2328.96
if they had a say in it

2329.599 --> 2340.6400000000003
so but can they be forced to change is

2332.56 --> 2342.88
that even possible

2340.64 --> 2344.16
with the free speech it how it works

2342.88 --> 2346.6400000000003
because

2344.16 --> 2348.56
yeah to change free speech to take that

2346.64 --> 2351.359
down would be a disaster

2348.56 --> 2351.359
on the long run

2351.92 --> 2356.32
and that's probably why they haven't

2353.599 --> 2357.92
been just blatantly removed by trump

2356.32 --> 2361.76
i think that's probably the reason why

2357.92 --> 2361.76
he chose to just let it kind of happen

2363.839 --> 2367.68
because yeah what if you really start to

2365.76 --> 2371.3590000000004
restrict speech

2367.68 --> 2373.1189999999997
from your side you poison the will of

2371.359 --> 2374.16
their own principles of the freedom of

2373.119 --> 2376.48
speech that is

2374.16 --> 2377.92
very held high in the libertarian spirit

2376.48 --> 2379.28
and

2377.92 --> 2380.96
and the founding fathers of course

2379.28 --> 2385.0400000000004
constitution all that so

2380.96 --> 2385.76
yeah that's what i think about why he

2385.04 --> 2389.2
probably

2385.76 --> 2390.079
did it like that although was it really

2389.2 --> 2393.9199999999996
worth it

2390.079 --> 2397.28
i don't know cody potentially

2393.92 --> 2399.119
like just put lawsuits adam just barash

2397.28 --> 2403.2000000000003
them maybe with lawsuits

2399.119 --> 2406.1600000000003
or something and really prove their lies

2403.2 --> 2409.52
make them just respond and basically

2406.16 --> 2409.52
dissect their own words

2409.68 --> 2414.16
almost like what i don't know nathan

2411.44 --> 2416.96
does with ballers sometimes you know

2414.16 --> 2419.04
i think that would have really cracked

2416.96 --> 2421.52
open the mainstream media

2419.04 --> 2423.7599999999998
those people and their narrative

2421.52 --> 2424.8
although in a way trump has sort of on

2423.76 --> 2426.7200000000003
occasion

2424.8 --> 2428.319
he tries to do that he tries to make fun

2426.72 --> 2428.8799999999997
of them he tries to lay out how they're

2428.319 --> 2431.52
lying

2428.88 --> 2432.0
so he's done a little of that with just

2431.52 --> 2435.2
like

2432.0 --> 2438.079
right one guy in the presidency

2435.2 --> 2441.5989999999997
sometimes doing that i guess

2438.079 --> 2441.599
popularizing it a little

2443.839 --> 2446.0
but

2447.52 --> 2450.56
yeah they're still going

2451.68 --> 2454.319
unabated

2455.44 --> 2459.2000000000003
they're not toning down or anything

2460.48 --> 2462.8
right

2464.88 --> 2468.8
creepy joe should be in a home oh

2474.319 --> 2477.92
this yeah

2479.2 --> 2484.64
so i think sometimes that joe is just

2482.72 --> 2485.839
doing this almost out of a favor because

2484.64 --> 2487.839
the guy is just like

2485.839 --> 2490.0
he's ready like really ready for

2487.839 --> 2492.48
retirement if you know what i mean

2490.0 --> 2495.839
he's just like yeah i'll do it whatever

2492.48 --> 2495.839
i'll act to be depressed like

2498.56 --> 2503.839
like how much does he really care

2501.599 --> 2505.599
like when you look at it when what he

2503.839 --> 2508.7999999999997
does like he's basically

2505.599 --> 2511.28
trying to be a pretty good actor but

2508.8 --> 2513.3590000000004
yeah also stumbling enormously and

2511.28 --> 2515.44
messing up

2513.359 --> 2516.48
it's like i get the feeling he's doing

2515.44 --> 2519.76
his best to

2516.48 --> 2520.72
do that role thing but when it comes to

2519.76 --> 2524.5600000000004
like actual

2520.72 --> 2527.68
vision or anything really no this guy is

2524.56 --> 2527.68
ready for retirement

2527.76 --> 2537.8390000000004
it's getting old like for real not just

2531.92 --> 2537.839
on the on the outside

2539.28 --> 2541.52
right

2548.4 --> 2552.4
yeah and of course he's opening the door

2550.0 --> 2556.079
for kamala because

2552.4 --> 2559.2000000000003
look the democratic party is effectively

2556.079 --> 2561.3590000000004
functioning like a communist party

2559.2 --> 2563.2799999999997
they're all just puppets fulfilling

2561.359 --> 2565.5989999999997
whatever role they think they

2563.28 --> 2568.0
need to play in order to convince the

2565.599 --> 2570.319
public to surrender to them

2568.0 --> 2572.88
because communists are per definition

2570.319 --> 2575.68
hostile

2572.88 --> 2576.96
they don't really tell you that a lot of

2575.68 --> 2581.44
the times

2576.96 --> 2584.079
but they are they are

2581.44 --> 2585.04
they prefer fooling people into

2584.079 --> 2588.2400000000002
following them

2585.04 --> 2590.48
then actually building relations on

2588.24 --> 2595.4399999999996
average

2590.48 --> 2597.839
the higher ones 100 right

2595.44 --> 2599.599
so it doesn't really matter who's in

2597.839 --> 2601.359
charge

2599.599 --> 2604.0
because they are a communist party

2601.359 --> 2607.119
they're all just heads of the criminal

2604.0 --> 2608.72
circle basically so

2607.119 --> 2610.8
yeah whoever is going to be the most

2608.72 --> 2614.7999999999997
effective will be pushed forward

2610.8 --> 2618.319
they don't care and if somebody has the

2614.8 --> 2620.1600000000003
role then they will be the spokesperson

2618.319 --> 2621.52
and if they step out of line they get

2620.16 --> 2623.04
into big trouble

2621.52 --> 2624.8
like because i'm pretty sure they're

2623.04 --> 2626.319
probably all blackmailing each other

2624.8 --> 2628.0
it's like if somebody steps out of line

2626.319 --> 2630.8
they're all gonna get some personal

2628.0 --> 2632.72
punishment because of that from

2630.8 --> 2636.6400000000003
individuals

2632.72 --> 2636.64
that they rule with because yeah

2637.52 --> 2640.72
it's how they do business

2639.43 --> 2643.5989999999997
[Music]

2640.72 --> 2647.85
so they keep things under control with

2643.599 --> 2651.32
each other

2647.85 --> 2651.3199999999997
[Music]

2660.64 --> 2665.7599999999998
the government will still remain in

2662.48 --> 2665.76
control sure they will

2673.52 --> 2678.079
i can't wait for trump to basically

2675.839 --> 2680.64
reveal for the first time

2678.079 --> 2682.2400000000002
after the chaos breaks out that that

2680.64 --> 2683.839
indeed the government is still in

2682.24 --> 2686.56
control

2683.839 --> 2689.2
when it's probably gonna look very much

2686.56 --> 2692.72
like they're not

2689.2 --> 2692.72
at least for a small period

2696.4 --> 2700.7200000000003
i don't know it all depends on what type

2699.52 --> 2701.119
of moves they're going to make if

2700.72 --> 2702.9599999999996
they're

2701.119 --> 2704.2400000000002
really going to almost like create a

2702.96 --> 2707.359
civil war

2704.24 --> 2707.359
like this sort of

2707.44 --> 2711.599
or yeah like what i said that they're

2710.319 --> 2713.839
almost like going to

2711.599 --> 2716.4
just act like it never happened and

2713.839 --> 2721.359
literally force people into places

2716.4 --> 2721.359
in the government like that i don't know

2722.4 --> 2727.92
something it just gotta happen

2725.599 --> 2729.839
or maybe it's just gonna be a major

2727.92 --> 2732.56
dispel moment for the entire

2729.839 --> 2733.44
democratic party it's like on a snap and

2732.56 --> 2735.7599999999998
it's all like

2733.44 --> 2739.44
no we just freaking lost there's nowhere

2735.76 --> 2739.44
else to go and just everybody just

2739.599 --> 2742.7200000000003
drops into hell

2745.76 --> 2749.44
who knows i don't know

2749.599 --> 2752.7200000000003
something's gonna happen

2752.88 --> 2761.839
just don't know for sure what

2772.8 --> 2776.0
joe definitely had some stuff going on

2774.64 --> 2779.68
with his son

2776.0 --> 2779.68
well his son's just messed up

2783.839 --> 2787.68
i'm i'm gonna be a complete conspiracy

2786.56 --> 2789.599
theorist so don't

2787.68 --> 2792.0789999999997
hang any direct weight on this because

2789.599 --> 2794.8
this is basically a conceptual

2792.079 --> 2797.04
emulation based on just general

2794.8 --> 2799.3590000000004
suspicion from my side

2797.04 --> 2802.079
that he probably at some points was just

2799.359 --> 2803.7599999999998
kind of like forced to break his son and

2802.079 --> 2806.96
that's why he's so [ __ ] up

2803.76 --> 2808.5600000000004
like they made him do that and then he

2806.96 --> 2811.68
became almost like an mk

2808.56 --> 2815.119
ultra drone

2811.68 --> 2816.8799999999997
for his family business

2815.119 --> 2818.1600000000003
because that's just the feeling i get of

2816.88 --> 2821.599
him he's so empty

2818.16 --> 2824.72
so depressed it's like

2821.599 --> 2828.48
he doesn't have any control over what he

2824.72 --> 2830.64
does and not because he lost control but

2828.48 --> 2832.56
because he literally just kind of knows

2830.64 --> 2835.5989999999997
he's [ __ ]

2832.56 --> 2835.599
no matter what he does

2835.68 --> 2841.1189999999997
and that's why it gets even worse you

2838.56 --> 2844.7999999999997
know with hunter

2841.119 --> 2850.48
but anyway yeah that

2844.8 --> 2852.88
it's just a conspiracy conceptualization

2850.48 --> 2854.16
i don't know what happened maybe he was

2852.88 --> 2858.319
just born

2854.16 --> 2860.319
nasty that happens sometimes and if they

2858.319 --> 2861.839
then don't get corrected

2860.319 --> 2863.7599999999998
because they're in a [ __ ] up family

2861.839 --> 2867.92
yeah then they stay nasty

2863.76 --> 2867.92
that happens too so it could be either

2870.839 --> 2876.96
way

2873.599 --> 2879.839
oh hello george cuts saul

2876.96 --> 2879.839
cotsuilis

2883.04 --> 2890.0
okay oh sure

2886.96 --> 2895.599
why not amsterdam

2890.0 --> 2895.599
cool okay why not

2898.0 --> 2904.64
all right yeah ambol but the thing is

2901.52 --> 2905.359
with drugs most of the time people start

2904.64 --> 2908.72
to use

2905.359 --> 2910.5589999999997
drugs because they have [ __ ] they can't

2908.72 --> 2912.3999999999996
deal with and then they just try to get

2910.559 --> 2914.3190000000004
away from that [ __ ]

2912.4 --> 2917.2000000000003
that's why most people get addicted to

2914.319 --> 2917.2
drugs like that

2917.359 --> 2921.44
see because otherwise it's very unlikely

2921.04 --> 2925.7599999999998
to

2921.44 --> 2925.76
just stick because

2926.48 --> 2931.04
yeah it might be impressive in the

2928.079 --> 2932.6400000000003
moment but you have no need to escape

2931.04 --> 2942.16
from anything so you won't

2932.64 --> 2945.92
latch on to it so much

2942.16 --> 2948.3999999999996
anyway yeah george sure

2945.92 --> 2951.119
but i'm not going to answer them if you

2948.4 --> 2954.4
like if you want to do that then

2951.119 --> 2956.079
yeah get over here or maybe i don't know

2954.4 --> 2957.4700000000003
i don't even know what a good spot for

2956.079 --> 2959.92
that would be

2957.47 --> 2964.319
[Music]

2959.92 --> 2966.25
hello i'm we might potentially even do

2964.319 --> 2967.68
it out here in the field

2966.25 --> 2971.76
[Music]

2967.68 --> 2977.2799999999997
there's enough space there and

2971.76 --> 2977.28
yeah why not okay cool

2977.44 --> 2983.119
all right uh yeah but if you're gonna do

2979.68 --> 2985.359
that do contact me on skype and then

2983.119 --> 2988.6400000000003
just don't just unexpectedly pop by like

2985.359 --> 2988.64
that preferably

2991.839 --> 2996.72
but that would be interesting to do

2993.2 --> 2999.5989999999997
maybe yeah skype

2996.72 --> 3001.4399999999996
the uh in the description box over at

2999.599 --> 3005.6800000000003
the youtube video

3001.44 --> 3005.68
it's in the first line my skype address

3007.599 --> 3014.8
you don't have to do it right now

3012.48 --> 3016.079
but if you're serious about yeah doing

3014.8 --> 3027.8390000000004
something like that

3016.079 --> 3027.8390000000004
then contact me there

3032.079 --> 3041.8390000000004
hey barry davis

3045.76 --> 3051.92
hmm traveled around with vp

3048.88 --> 3054.319
dad making money around the world

3051.92 --> 3056.0
right ambo okay that that brings a

3054.319 --> 3057.839
different picture then he probably just

3056.0 --> 3060.64
drowned in luxury too much

3057.839 --> 3062.48
so daddy spoiled him too much made him

3060.64 --> 3066.839
drown in the money and then just

3062.48 --> 3068.0
went off off the scale every time

3066.839 --> 3070.16
probably

3068.0 --> 3083.839
so then it's just a complete lack of

3070.16 --> 3083.839
discipline from his dad's side

3133.839 --> 3139.839
right yeah no doubt he was no doubt

3138.079 --> 3141.599
i've been hearing about that for some

3139.839 --> 3144.0
time even

3141.599 --> 3145.599
like even during the obama period alex

3144.0 --> 3147.599
jones was basically just

3145.599 --> 3150.48
tapping into information sources like

3147.599 --> 3152.7200000000003
that so even things like that got

3150.48 --> 3153.52
early on revealed like even in the

3152.72 --> 3155.9199999999996
process

3153.52 --> 3158.88
like almost directly after and [ __ ]

3155.92 --> 3158.88
things would lick through

3159.359 --> 3167.839
so all of this does sound familiar

3178.839 --> 3181.839
okay

3195.44 --> 3199.04
wow what a bizarre situation that must

3197.599 --> 3201.04
be

3199.04 --> 3203.7599999999998
like travel with your done with your

3201.04 --> 3208.16
daddy and then just get like

3203.76 --> 3211.3590000000004
huge amount of bright money

3208.16 --> 3215.04
from your dad's sprite but that's just

3211.359 --> 3218.16
that's gonna [ __ ] you up man karmically

3215.04 --> 3221.44
that's just crazy so

3218.16 --> 3237.839
no wonder then that he's just went off

3221.44 --> 3237.839
the reservation

3244.88 --> 3252.4
right so yay talking about politics and

3248.839 --> 3256.0789999999997
why right yeah it's no surprise though

3252.4 --> 3259.6800000000003
because of course the elections tomorrow

3256.079 --> 3259.6800000000003
it's going to be nutty tuesday

3260.8 --> 3266.88
so yes like what do i expect

3264.24 --> 3268.5589999999997
what not talking about it like on the

3266.88 --> 3271.92
day before that's like

3268.559 --> 3275.2000000000003
ridiculous so link

3271.92 --> 3275.2000000000003
it for when what

3275.92 --> 3281.6800000000003
business partner now come on

3279.28 --> 3284.1600000000003
dude guys you can all look that up

3281.68 --> 3288.0789999999997
yourself i'm not gonna be

3284.16 --> 3291.44
like a rumor link for like presidential

3288.079 --> 3293.2000000000003
[ __ ] no that is just not my my cup of

3291.44 --> 3295.2000000000003
tea

3293.2 --> 3297.4399999999996
my cup of tea is not large enough for

3295.2 --> 3297.4399999999996
that

3305.119 --> 3309.04
but hey yeah if you got a wrench or

3307.04 --> 3312.5589999999997
anything i don't mind if you

3309.04 --> 3312.5589999999997
drop something interesting

3312.64 --> 3316.64
you think i might not like it and at

3314.24 --> 3318.319
least ask that's what the wrenches are

3316.64 --> 3321.04
also for so you can literally

3318.319 --> 3321.92
because i don't mind being like a a

3321.04 --> 3325.599
place for

3321.92 --> 3325.599
people to find good links

3326.0 --> 3331.04
and since i'm not a very very extensive

3329.28 --> 3333.599
digger

3331.04 --> 3335.359
it's very it's very good if people in

3333.599 --> 3338.96
chat

3335.359 --> 3341.119
yeah use that opportunity

3338.96 --> 3342.88
and then we can all connect can all

3341.119 --> 3346.0
utilize our

3342.88 --> 3349.6800000000003
talents the best

3346.0 --> 3352.64
and make like this great nexus point

3349.68 --> 3355.359
of information however small it may be

3352.64 --> 3355.359
on the internet

3355.52 --> 3359.359
it'll be good and it'll be persistent

3358.48 --> 3363.839
and i like that

3359.359 --> 3365.92
and that's kind of what i wanted

3363.839 --> 3368.799
that's even kind of what i wanted when i

3365.92 --> 3371.359
was managing a forum

3368.799 --> 3374.319
back then about conspiracy theories and

3371.359 --> 3377.44
yeah the alex jones driven

3374.319 --> 3381.2799999999997
stuff like around 2010

3377.44 --> 3383.76
2008 to 2012

3381.28 --> 3383.76
roughly

3386.079 --> 3389.3590000000004
during the obama era

3389.44 --> 3393.119
and i wanted it to be this place where

3391.839 --> 3396.4
you could always go

3393.119 --> 3398.4
and find something relevant that that

3396.4 --> 3401.599
really helps on the long run

3398.4 --> 3402.7200000000003
just to know about it and i would always

3401.599 --> 3405.52
be very picky

3402.72 --> 3407.4399999999996
about basically sifting out the rumors

3405.52 --> 3407.92
and then disclaiming dispelling them

3407.44 --> 3409.76
like no

3407.92 --> 3411.599
this is a rumor this is actual

3409.76 --> 3414.7990000000004
information

3411.599 --> 3416.88
i was all about that back then

3414.799 --> 3419.28
and i kind of kind of wanted back in and

3416.88 --> 3421.2000000000003
well in an interactive format now

3419.28 --> 3423.28
because that's what this is i'm doing

3421.2 --> 3426.3999999999996
the same except i'm also on camera

3423.28 --> 3426.4
performing and talking

3426.48 --> 3433.76
and of course flat earth yeah

3429.76 --> 3435.599
didn't even get into that back then

3433.76 --> 3437.8390000000004
because everybody would just start be

3435.599 --> 3439.599
like what is this ridiculous

3437.839 --> 3442.799
and then i would feel ridiculous and

3439.599 --> 3445.6400000000003
then it's like ugh

3442.799 --> 3448.4
let's just let's not distract get

3445.64 --> 3450.319
distracted by the distraction of flat

3448.4 --> 3451.28
earth and stick to it with what is

3450.319 --> 3454.319
important

3451.28 --> 3456.96
who is president and yeah

3454.319 --> 3459.92
yeah i was there and i thought i was

3456.96 --> 3462.2400000000002
probably a lot better at it than most

3459.92 --> 3466.0
not getting too dragged away into the

3462.24 --> 3469.2799999999997
the superficials but i still

3466.0 --> 3469.28
i still was like that

3469.599 --> 3473.04
and i just wanted to clear up the

3471.119 --> 3474.0
mistakes because i did see even

3473.04 --> 3476.0
believing that

3474.0 --> 3477.52
not realizing how flattered is not a

3476.0 --> 3479.359
distraction but actually

3477.52 --> 3482.319
very helpful to realize what the [ __ ]

3479.359 --> 3482.319
going on in this world

3483.44 --> 3487.28
but even then i could still see people

3485.52 --> 3490.88
around me were making mistakes just like

3487.28 --> 3494.48
i always have like even in school

3490.88 --> 3497.6800000000003
where i made this attempt to basically

3494.48 --> 3501.52
try and like let's stand up and fix

3497.68 --> 3502.319
this and then the jesuit guy stood up

3501.52 --> 3504.799
and said

3502.319 --> 3504.799
nope

3514.839 --> 3517.839
right

3528.559 --> 3534.799
flat earthers exist that could not

3531.76 --> 3534.7990000000004
happen on a globe

3537.599 --> 3540.1600000000003
could it not

3540.64 --> 3547.359
well technically you are correct because

3543.68 --> 3550.3999999999996
nobody could exist on the globe because

3547.359 --> 3552.799
you couldn't breathe even

3550.4 --> 3554.2400000000002
if you had the ability to just

3552.799 --> 3557.599
materialize there as

3554.24 --> 3558.0789999999997
is so yeah nothing really no living

3557.599 --> 3560.799
person

3558.079 --> 3562.1600000000003
can exist on the globe in the way they

3560.799 --> 3564.079
present it

3562.16 --> 3566.72
because yeah physics doesn't work that

3564.079 --> 3569.2000000000003
way there are certain things as living

3566.72 --> 3570.3999999999996
organisms certain conditions pressurized

3569.2 --> 3572.8799999999997
conditions that we

3570.4 --> 3573.76
require in order for our metabolic

3572.88 --> 3576.96
processes

3573.76 --> 3577.92
to function and that can happen on a

3576.96 --> 3580.64
globe

3577.92 --> 3580.64
that's correct

3582.799 --> 3588.88
yeah i know i didn't see it at first

3586.319 --> 3588.88
the joke

3591.28 --> 3594.3190000000004
a reversed ontological argument it might

3593.68 --> 3597.1189999999997
be

3594.319 --> 3599.2799999999997
i think i think you might be right there
