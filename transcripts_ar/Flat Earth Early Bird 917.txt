196.4 --> 200.48000000000002
and managed to give it a proper title

200.56 --> 204.879
based on the subjects the first part

207.04 --> 209.599
so yeah

211.68 --> 215.44
i'm definitely on form

219.599 --> 223.11999999999998
let's see what we can do today

224.959 --> 229.33
anyway let's see if the notes that i did

227.04 --> 230.72
managed to make

229.33 --> 235.43900000000002
[Applause]

230.72 --> 238.84
nope completely forgot

235.439 --> 241.04
and i'm at the last page of my note

238.84 --> 243.84
block

241.04 --> 243.84
right uh

245.76 --> 251.76
what did i do yeah i think i watched

249.68 --> 255.84
some home benjamin

251.76 --> 255.84
weren't really a lot of live streams

256.16 --> 258.88000000000005
on youtube

259.199 --> 269.84000000000003
things that i'm subscribed to yeah

261.919 --> 269.84
barely any

271.199 --> 274.32
uh so yeah i kind of ended up in the

273.6 --> 278.16
evening

274.32 --> 283.759
night it's uh 11 o'clock my

278.16 --> 287.12
time watching the alex jones sunday show

283.759 --> 287.12
it was quite entertaining

290.8 --> 294.16
and yeah playing that freaking game

292.8 --> 297.36
again civilization

294.16 --> 301.12
six just to be careful that game like

297.36 --> 301.12
really sucks the time out of me

301.68 --> 311.12
but it is entertaining though

304.88 --> 315.199
uh let's see

311.12 --> 315.199
i don't watch like a movie or anything

323.199 --> 325.84000000000003
no

330.8 --> 333.91900000000004
all right yeah but uh not to not

333.28 --> 336.79999999999995
yesterday

333.919 --> 339.84
day before i did start watching a

336.8 --> 339.84000000000003
netflix series

341.759 --> 346.16
just interesting

346.4 --> 349.52
especially in reflection to the

348.32 --> 353.52
situation now called

349.52 --> 356.96
sweet tooth about these weird

353.52 --> 361.44
animal hybrids that are

356.96 --> 363.84
correlating with viral outbreak

361.44 --> 366.56
and the world has turned savage like

363.84 --> 369.039
it's a typical post-apocalyptic

366.56 --> 369.039
setup

370.319 --> 375.03900000000004
but with the virus the pinky twitch

374.24 --> 376.8
virus

375.039 --> 378.4
doesn't really they don't even say what

376.8 --> 379.28000000000003
else it's supposed to do but it's like

378.4 --> 381.44
oh if your

379.28 --> 382.79999999999995
pinky starts twitching then you got the

381.44 --> 385.759
virus so

382.8 --> 385.759
very simple trick

388.88 --> 393.759
and yeah it's it's kind of like it's

391.44 --> 396.8
turning into sort of an adventure

393.759 --> 397.44
story set up it is an entertaining

396.8 --> 400.72
series

397.44 --> 400.71999999999997
but it is weird though

406.08 --> 411.039
right haven't watched it yesterday did

408.319 --> 414.56
watch it two days ago

411.039 --> 416.4
hey emailed another picture

414.56 --> 423.84
okay cool seeking star wars i'll check

416.4 --> 423.84
it out welcome to the chat

427.199 --> 429.599
whoa

431.28 --> 439.67999999999995
okay that looks weird

434.56 --> 439.68
that looks really weird fascinating

439.759 --> 443.36
right now i'll share it

449.68 --> 454.72
right this is the picture seeking star

451.919 --> 454.71999999999997
wars sent me

457.199 --> 465.84000000000003
yeah those red beams on the left that

460.24 --> 465.84000000000003
red beam on the left that's pretty weird

467.919 --> 479.84
does it actually look like that even

469.68 --> 479.84000000000003
with the with your regular eyes

480.96 --> 485.75899999999996
yeah beautiful location by the way

488.319 --> 493.84000000000003
thanks for sharing that seeking stir

490.84 --> 493.84
water

521.839 --> 535.839
hey neil cosentino good to see you

546.839 --> 549.839
uh

549.92 --> 555.92
man my job feels so so much better it's

557.12 --> 560.399
it's kind of weird to even realize that

559.2 --> 563.6
because i'm used to

560.399 --> 565.2
basically having a lot of like issues

563.6 --> 569.279
minor issues like

565.2 --> 571.6
and nuisances throughout my body

569.279 --> 572.72
like i'm used to having something all

571.6 --> 576.72
the time right

572.72 --> 581.2
well my jaw it seems like

576.72 --> 584.399
it's so much better now that

581.2 --> 584.399
it must have been like

584.48 --> 587.519
over a year

588.88 --> 592.8
since it felt this stable

594.72 --> 601.839
so yeah because it was always a little

597.76 --> 605.8389999999999
naggy right very little and then

601.839 --> 605.839
got really bad like two weeks ago

607.12 --> 611.68
and now it's so good it's like whoa i

609.68 --> 615.04
even forgot what it's like

611.68 --> 615.04
so very happy about that

616.0 --> 622.88
and like i literally even went as far as

619.519 --> 623.44
like i ate hard bread and chewed it like

622.88 --> 627.36
even

623.44 --> 631.44
on that side and it worked out fine like

627.36 --> 634.399
that that's like whoa i haven't had that

631.44 --> 635.7600000000001
in a long time i'm still going to be

634.399 --> 638.88
careful with it though

635.76 --> 638.88
not going to push my luck

639.04 --> 646.7199999999999
right so i hope nathan is also

642.24 --> 649.2
feeling a lot better hello steamy

646.72 --> 649.2
traveler

657.44 --> 664.1600000000001
dean wright hello

661.76 --> 664.88
all right so i got no green tea with me

664.16 --> 670.079
because

664.88 --> 670.079
yeah i woke up way too late today

671.92 --> 677.1999999999999
so i just didn't have any time for it i

673.92 --> 677.1999999999999
barely got my coffee

680.16 --> 689.8389999999999
i got some grapefruit juice though

700.839 --> 703.839
uh-huh

714.839 --> 717.839
ugh

728.839 --> 731.839
huh

738.079 --> 742.8
yes neil yeah over at jam pandas they're

741.92 --> 747.36
probably

742.8 --> 747.3599999999999
just focusing on how to properly

747.68 --> 750.7199999999999
presuppose you're standing on the ball

749.519 --> 753.12
earth

750.72 --> 754.639
make it convincing and get away with it

753.12 --> 756.839
because nobody over there is going to

754.639 --> 758.8
confront you with how that's actually

756.839 --> 773.839
wrong

758.8 --> 773.8389999999999
yeah that sounds typical jim pandas

784.839 --> 787.839
so

801.6 --> 805.839
so yeah if hey i'm up for subject you

804.72 --> 810.0790000000001
know i'm still

805.839 --> 810.0790000000001
waking up slightly but

810.88 --> 816.0
it was weird too because i think i like

814.16 --> 819.04
had a dream of

816.0 --> 821.6
her partial dream of actually doing a

819.04 --> 821.5999999999999
live show

825.36 --> 828.8000000000001
like even late in the evening sometimes

827.92 --> 830.959
i just

828.8 --> 832.88
end up thinking about a whole bunch of

830.959 --> 833.4399999999999
things of like what would i say what

832.88 --> 836.72
would i

833.44 --> 840.8000000000001
unfold if this or that subject

836.72 --> 845.12
came up i kind of like simulate myself

840.8 --> 857.8389999999999
in my head what what would i say

845.12 --> 857.839
and what would that do

875.92 --> 881.4399999999999
wow seeking star wars that's a bizarre

880.399 --> 885.839
quote

881.44 --> 885.839
i also get the feeling it's wrong

889.04 --> 892.3199999999999
how does science contradict the

891.279 --> 899.8389999999999
knowledge of

892.32 --> 899.839
the heart i disagree

908.72 --> 917.279
our signs will definitely contradict

913.36 --> 917.92
knowledge you hold on to despite having

917.279 --> 921.68
seen

917.92 --> 924.8389999999999
proof against it because of the heart

921.68 --> 926.56
right but that's not knowledge of the

924.839 --> 928.8800000000001
heart

926.56 --> 932.0
like the heart wants truth the heart

928.88 --> 934.0
wants discovery the heart wants to

932.0 --> 935.279
want you to figure it out and at the

934.0 --> 937.839
same time it's also

935.279 --> 937.8389999999999
going to

938.56 --> 945.199
be the source of like telling you

942.16 --> 947.04
not to not to dig into it because it

945.199 --> 950.16
might hurt you

947.04 --> 952.7199999999999
might hurt your feelings

950.16 --> 956.639
or bring into doubt certain things

952.72 --> 960.0790000000001
you've been holding on to very closely

956.639 --> 961.12
and that you feel you need that to exist

960.079 --> 963.92
or

961.12 --> 968.079
for that to be real and then the heart

963.92 --> 970.7199999999999
stops you

968.079 --> 971.4399999999999
rather gives off a signal that will

970.72 --> 973.519
signal

971.44 --> 975.6800000000001
a lot of people to actually stop and

973.519 --> 978.639
disengage instead of taking the

975.68 --> 978.6389999999999
challenge and see

979.199 --> 983.8389999999999
what metal you're made of

987.12 --> 990.24
hey here we go again

990.56 --> 994.7199999999999
mainstream but that's ridiculous

994.88 --> 998.72
mainstream science is

1004.32 --> 1007.839
like it's science and it's empirical or

1006.48 --> 1011.759
repeatable

1007.839 --> 1014.1600000000001
or it's not science

1011.759 --> 1015.6800000000001
mainstream that's a really confusing way

1014.16 --> 1018.7199999999999
to say it's seeking sterile water

1015.68 --> 1018.7199999999999
mainstream signs

1022.839 --> 1025.839
like

1036.839 --> 1039.839
so

1043.199 --> 1048.16
unless you specifically mean to the

1049.6 --> 1056.9599999999998
science machinations culture

1052.799 --> 1056.96
things that are being held up

1057.2 --> 1061.52
as valid

1062.32 --> 1067.2
in in teachings and all that in that you

1065.44 --> 1071.6000000000001
still get to be taught in schools

1067.2 --> 1071.6000000000001
about the cavendish experiment

1071.679 --> 1076.48
pseudoscience then well yeah that of

1073.679 --> 1080.799
course if it's not

1076.48 --> 1083.52
empirical science scientific method

1080.799 --> 1086.4
then it's very easy to end up with

1083.52 --> 1086.4
pseudoscience

1087.6 --> 1092.7199999999998
right it's all about the claim and the

1090.88 --> 1094.0
evidence for the claim and if it's not

1092.72 --> 1109.44
empirical and testable

1094.0 --> 1113.36
yeah then it becomes pseudoscience

1109.44 --> 1117.039
mainstream science doesn't do belief

1113.36 --> 1117.039
uh you'd be surprised

1119.28 --> 1124.48
mainstream science

1122.559 --> 1126.96
that i've elaborated on that what that

1124.48 --> 1126.96
will mean

1127.44 --> 1137.28
it actually tells you a lot of things

1132.0 --> 1142.16
that our beliefs are real like gravity

1137.28 --> 1145.52
they present it in a in an open

1142.16 --> 1148.88
easy to reify way

1145.52 --> 1151.9189999999999
and they make you accept it

1148.88 --> 1154.24
hello aries 106. i sound tired well not

1151.919 --> 1154.24
really

1163.36 --> 1168.0
but i basically just woke up an hour ago

1168.72 --> 1172.559
i'm not tired though i did get plenty of

1176.84 --> 1182.6599999999999
sleep

1179.55 --> 1182.6599999999999
[Music]

1185.039 --> 1193.84
an optical anomaly hello andrew

1189.44 --> 1193.8400000000001
what optical anomaly

1250.799 --> 1253.28
hello

1253.919 --> 1260.3200000000002
andrew you typed something in chat

1260.72 --> 1264.4
what are you talking about

1275.28 --> 1282.0
mainstream science has hypotheses

1279.28 --> 1284.559
which can turn into theories with

1282.0 --> 1284.559
evidence

1288.84 --> 1291.84
what

1297.28 --> 1304.96
so they don't have a hypothesis

1301.76 --> 1308.0
because if it

1304.96 --> 1310.559
isn't a scientific theory

1308.0 --> 1312.48
yet and especially with evidence

1310.559 --> 1314.1589999999999
suggesting that the evidence is not

1312.48 --> 1316.32
there before then it's not really a

1314.159 --> 1319.44
hypothesis it's more like a wild

1316.32 --> 1322.559
guess based on

1319.44 --> 1326.48
correlative patterns

1322.559 --> 1326.48
right that's not a hypothesis

1328.0 --> 1335.52
if it's a hypothesis you are presenting

1331.6 --> 1338.9599999999998
a phenomena natural phenomena

1335.52 --> 1342.08
and then you claim the cause

1338.96 --> 1344.8400000000001
of the effect through hypothesis

1342.08 --> 1346.32
through varying and manipulating the

1344.84 --> 1348.8799999999999
phenomena

1346.32 --> 1351.28
that you presume is is causing the

1348.88 --> 1351.2800000000002
effect

1352.4 --> 1355.76
and you demonstrate it physically and

1355.36 --> 1357.9189999999999
then

1355.76 --> 1360.32
that has to be repeatable only then does

1357.919 --> 1363.5200000000002
it become a hypothesis

1360.32 --> 1367.039
if you don't have those steps then

1363.52 --> 1368.48
it's basically just speculation a wild

1367.039 --> 1372.32
guess

1368.48 --> 1375.6
very likely to be based on correlations

1372.32 --> 1378.48
yeah there's a lot of that doesn't make

1375.6 --> 1378.48
it science though

1384.799 --> 1392.96
no hypothesis is not an a proposed

1388.0 --> 1396.799
explanation a hypothesis

1392.96 --> 1397.919
is a very specific claim the cause of an

1396.799 --> 1400.24
effect

1397.919 --> 1400.24
claim

1401.679 --> 1406.799
and when you make that claim you have to

1404.72 --> 1407.679
abide by the standards of the scientific

1406.799 --> 1410.32
method

1407.679 --> 1412.48
and actually present a way to vary and

1410.32 --> 1413.36
manipulate the natural phenomena in

1412.48 --> 1415.52
order to

1413.36 --> 1417.84
establish whether it actually causes the

1415.52 --> 1417.84
effect

1423.12 --> 1431.84
it's not just an explanation

1433.679 --> 1437.3600000000001
and just an explanation that's a

1436.08 --> 1440.6399999999999
colloquial

1437.36 --> 1445.84
theory that's just an idea a suggestion

1440.64 --> 1445.8400000000001
a guess

1449.76 --> 1454.32
it's very difficult to start accepting

1452.88 --> 1457.7600000000002
colloquial theory

1454.32 --> 1460.72
theorizing when you

1457.76 --> 1461.44
are actually dabbling in the field of

1460.72 --> 1464.64
science

1461.44 --> 1465.76
because it is such a contradiction with

1464.64 --> 1471.76
it and it's it's

1465.76 --> 1473.76
it's a cultural use of the word again

1471.76 --> 1476.24
and it's not really the proper way to

1473.76 --> 1478.72
use the word theory even

1476.24 --> 1487.84
because it originally stems from science

1478.72 --> 1487.84
in the scientific method

1491.36 --> 1499.84
generic generic that's

1495.6 --> 1502.48
again colloquial it's not

1499.84 --> 1504.08
you either use it colloquially and

1502.48 --> 1509.52
basically

1504.08 --> 1512.08
talk with science words culturally

1509.52 --> 1514.1589999999999
misuse of the words really when you

1512.08 --> 1519.12
think about it carefully or you

1514.159 --> 1522.4
follow the science physics science

1519.12 --> 1529.84
the method the actual method

1522.4 --> 1529.8400000000001
and then you use it correctly

1543.44 --> 1546.64
scientific theory

1550.64 --> 1554.8400000000001
well the thing is tiny wumble originally

1553.039 --> 1557.76
all theories are

1554.84 --> 1561.1999999999998
scientific right so again this is a

1557.76 --> 1565.279
cultural revolution at work

1561.2 --> 1571.8400000000001
in the use of words bypassing what it

1565.279 --> 1571.84
really supposed to mean

1572.08 --> 1575.1999999999998
but i guess that if you would emphasize

1574.72 --> 1578.32
okay

1575.2 --> 1580.48
with theory i just mean an idea and

1578.32 --> 1583.52
when i say scientific theory then it's

1580.48 --> 1585.039
actually scientific hypothesis based

1583.52 --> 1587.9189999999999
okay if that's the way you want to

1585.039 --> 1587.919
communicate but

1593.36 --> 1599.84
i try to avoid that

1610.84 --> 1613.84
so

1620.72 --> 1627.84
hey good servant good to see you

1637.44 --> 1644.48
excuse me tiny womble don't

1641.76 --> 1646.96
don't rearrange the words and put them

1644.48 --> 1652.84
back in my mouth like that

1646.96 --> 1654.72
i didn't say scientific theory is a

1652.84 --> 1669.36
guess

1654.72 --> 1671.3600000000001
the exactly the opposite

1669.36 --> 1673.6789999999999
yeah and scientific theory being the

1671.36 --> 1675.12
pinnacle of science that's very cute

1673.679 --> 1678.159
you want to say it like that that's

1675.12 --> 1682.6399999999999
still grounded into colloquialism

1678.159 --> 1685.6000000000001
because the scientific theory basically

1682.64 --> 1686.64
is science that is what it really is not

1685.6 --> 1689.6789999999999
the pinnacle

1686.64 --> 1691.76
because the other things are not science

1689.679 --> 1692.96
it's only signs when you use a

1691.76 --> 1695.76
hypothesis

1692.96 --> 1697.76
to establish the cause of an effect it's

1695.76 --> 1700.24
not like oh yeah that's the real

1697.76 --> 1703.279
special science and the rest is also

1700.24 --> 1703.279
science no it's not

1703.919 --> 1709.039
unless it is hypothesis-based proving

1706.64 --> 1712.3200000000002
the cause of an effect

1709.039 --> 1724.399
a natural occurring phenomenon

1712.32 --> 1726.72
then it's not science

1724.399 --> 1726.7199999999998
right

1730.17 --> 1733.6100000000001
[Music]

1731.6 --> 1734.9599999999998
you fell back asleep yeah i noticed that

1733.61 --> 1738.799
[Music]

1734.96 --> 1741.52
in in the skype chat you spoke up

1738.799 --> 1741.84
right as my show was gonna start now you

1741.52 --> 1744.399
fell

1741.84 --> 1746.559
back asleep again i hope your rhythm is

1744.399 --> 1750.1589999999999
going doing good

1746.559 --> 1752.399
you know being back home

1750.159 --> 1753.8400000000001
like don't get over excited don't stay

1752.399 --> 1756.32
up all night

1753.84 --> 1756.32
and stuff

1758.72 --> 1762.799
that'll typically happen you know if

1760.799 --> 1764.8799999999999
because it's like yeah i'm on vacation

1762.799 --> 1767.039
having my normal life again

1764.88 --> 1768.96
and then i would typically stay up very

1767.039 --> 1770.08
late but that's not so good for your

1768.96 --> 1772.0900000000001
system though

1770.08 --> 1774.48
it's better to take it easy

1772.09 --> 1781.4399999999998
[Music]

1774.48 --> 1784.08
it's behind me on the left

1781.44 --> 1795.52
you mean over there oh what is

1784.08 --> 1798.399
supposedly behind me on the left

1795.52 --> 1808.96
that's my right by the way but whatever

1798.399 --> 1812.0
i understand it

1808.96 --> 1812.0
all right here we go again

1812.24 --> 1818.24
my left my left well that's a door

1819.36 --> 1823.84
see that's a door

1850.24 --> 1854.3990000000001
that's exactly what happened okay good

1852.24 --> 1858.159
servant

1854.399 --> 1862.2399999999998
right just take care of it

1858.159 --> 1862.24
try to contain your enthusiasm

1862.72 --> 1866.48
and focus on recovering and resettling

1865.919 --> 1871.1200000000001
again

1866.48 --> 1879.84
instead focus on your health

1871.12 --> 1879.84
not on the freedom

1890.84 --> 1893.84
so

1905.039 --> 1911.919
it's brown

1908.159 --> 1913.3600000000001
is that a speaker wait you mean the

1911.919 --> 1915.44
thing right behind my head

1913.36 --> 1916.4799999999998
that's a that's a radiator that's a

1915.44 --> 1920.48
heater

1916.48 --> 1923.6
it's off all right next to is my

1920.48 --> 1923.6
toothbrush by the way

1924.799 --> 1928.08
is that what you mean that thing

1930.72 --> 1936.72
there's a chair right next to the door

1938.0 --> 1949.84
turn it on dude nathan

1962.72 --> 1970.3990000000001
so hey kevin you got any subject

1967.519 --> 1972.72
any substance to share with us in the

1970.399 --> 1972.7199999999998
chat

1974.559 --> 1978.96
or is your intellectual capacity range

1977.519 --> 1981.1200000000001
limited to

1978.96 --> 1991.8400000000001
pointing at things and then asking what

1981.12 --> 1991.84
is that

2016.84 --> 2019.84
so

2041.76 --> 2047.84
kevin you how old are you

2050.8 --> 2053.8390000000004
you know this is technically it a

2052.879 --> 2061.839
12-year

2053.839 --> 2061.839
plus hangout right

2072.839 --> 2075.839
so

2100.0 --> 2103.839
you're forty okay

2106.64 --> 2108.8799999999997
so

2109.76 --> 2117.44
you have any opinions or positions

2114.72 --> 2118.64
like in the flat earth versus globe

2117.44 --> 2131.839
debate that's been

2118.64 --> 2131.839
raging on for some time now

2144.48 --> 2151.2
no okay so

2147.839 --> 2153.839
did you just bump into my show was it

2151.2 --> 2156.16
recommended to you or something

2153.839 --> 2158.48
do you typically like to hang around

2156.16 --> 2159.7599999999998
flat earth hangouts or ballers or

2158.48 --> 2162.48
whatever

2159.76 --> 2164.079
like i'm having trouble actually getting

2162.48 --> 2173.839
a gauge on

2164.079 --> 2173.8390000000004
where you're at

2198.839 --> 2203.04
ah

2200.0 --> 2204.8
oh yeah by the way i got a interesting

2203.04 --> 2208.8
new number

2204.8 --> 2212.32
product like this is like the

2208.8 --> 2215.28
the tumeric drink except it's a really

2212.32 --> 2218.88
large bottle

2215.28 --> 2221.119
it's a pretty amazing like how much is

2218.88 --> 2221.119
this

2223.76 --> 2231.6800000000003
yeah this is

2228.24 --> 2235.359
like a third of the leader

2231.68 --> 2235.359
awesome big bottle

2240.32 --> 2257.839
okay you heard others talk about me

2244.079 --> 2257.8390000000004
where did you hear that who

2271.2 --> 2276.24
in the street really

2282.839 --> 2287.119
where

2284.88 --> 2290.7200000000003
that that kind of weirds me out man

2287.119 --> 2290.7200000000003
people are talking about me in the

2296.839 --> 2302.88
street

2299.359 --> 2302.88
fine you know fine

2303.839 --> 2310.16
i have no problem with it like dude

2307.119 --> 2310.6400000000003
as far as i'm concerned if i would be

2310.16 --> 2315.2799999999997
like

2310.64 --> 2315.2799999999997
the thing that everybody talks about

2315.599 --> 2320.88
keeps it to themselves or among one

2317.44 --> 2320.88
another that's fine by me

2321.2 --> 2327.839
as long as i hit the right snares you

2323.76 --> 2327.8390000000004
know i'm

2355.2 --> 2362.0789999999997
so when you heard others talk about me

2358.48 --> 2366.839
what did you hear them talk about

2362.079 --> 2369.8390000000004
in order to pique your interest kevin

2366.839 --> 2369.839
you

2370.56 --> 2377.52
they were saying i'm scared of dennis

2374.8 --> 2377.52
oh god

2378.4 --> 2383.839
oh that must have been trolls then

2383.92 --> 2388.4
why why would i be scared of him

2387.119 --> 2390.48
i've heard that before but it's

2388.4 --> 2397.839
ridiculous

2390.48 --> 2397.839
like why

2400.0 --> 2411.839
hello by the way sleeping warrior

2413.92 --> 2419.92
who is that anyway oh yeah he's a dutch

2416.96 --> 2419.92
football player

2422.56 --> 2427.2799999999997
like a quite a prominent one in the

2424.72 --> 2427.2799999999997
netherlands

2427.839 --> 2434.56
or at least he used to be even way back

2431.52 --> 2436.8
i don't know if he's still active

2434.56 --> 2437.2799999999997
football player or if he's like a coach

2436.8 --> 2439.76
now

2437.28 --> 2442.5600000000004
probably most of the really good

2439.76 --> 2453.8390000000004
football players turn into coaches later

2442.56 --> 2453.839
in the career

2465.52 --> 2467.839
you

2477.95 --> 2480.98
[Music]

2490.8 --> 2495.8390000000004
okay good serpent

2512.16 --> 2516.64
i have an alternative idea about it

2514.319 --> 2516.64
though

2516.88 --> 2524.7200000000003
right i suppose that potentially christ

2521.04 --> 2526.16
didn't actually die no he survived

2524.72 --> 2530.9599999999996
through that

2526.16 --> 2533.839
like beyond human punishment

2530.96 --> 2536.2400000000002
right which would be the miracle that he

2533.839 --> 2538.88
is able to

2536.24 --> 2539.7599999999998
be so convincingly dead and still live

2538.88 --> 2542.0
through it

2539.76 --> 2542.8
right that's another way of looking at

2542.0 --> 2546.079
it i like

2542.8 --> 2546.6400000000003
that way i don't i don't like it when

2546.079 --> 2550.6400000000003
people

2546.64 --> 2553.5989999999997
say he died for us

2550.64 --> 2556.8799999999997
it's like no no no he lived for us

2553.599 --> 2556.88
that's what i like to say

2558.079 --> 2564.96
right and i'd like to

2561.76 --> 2579.8390000000004
put that to its maximum like why

2564.96 --> 2579.839
are you assuming he died is god right

2580.079 --> 2583.92
what the [ __ ] what you never heard that

2581.839 --> 2587.599
from me before

2583.92 --> 2587.599
quite open about it

2587.76 --> 2592.1600000000003
then no remission of sin well who came

2591.119 --> 2595.359
up with that [ __ ]

2592.16 --> 2598.3999999999996
neil was it

2595.359 --> 2598.4
a bunch of priests

2600.56 --> 2605.2
oh i don't understand because i don't

2602.56 --> 2607.839
read right because

2605.2 --> 2609.359
that's how i like to put forth risky

2607.839 --> 2612.24
arguments right by

2609.359 --> 2614.24
completely not knowing anything about it

2612.24 --> 2615.2799999999997
and just blabbering it out there like an

2614.24 --> 2619.1189999999997
idiot

2615.28 --> 2620.8
i don't like to back up my ideas

2619.119 --> 2623.359
when they're risky and i put them out

2620.8 --> 2623.3590000000004
there right

2624.319 --> 2628.96
it's not like i've ever thought about

2626.319 --> 2628.96
this before

2632.839 --> 2635.839
neil

2636.64 --> 2638.96
right

2641.2 --> 2646.48
this remission of sin like what the sin

2643.76 --> 2650.1600000000003
we're born with

2646.48 --> 2653.359
the original sin the doom

2650.16 --> 2655.2799999999997
that is on to us supposedly that he has

2653.359 --> 2657.52
to die to take that away

2655.28 --> 2657.52
no

2658.8 --> 2665.52
we all have sin

2662.079 --> 2667.2000000000003
following us around trying yeah lucifer

2665.52 --> 2669.359
trying to trick us that's not gonna go

2667.2 --> 2672.16
away

2669.359 --> 2674.4
if jesus died it's it's there it's right

2672.16 --> 2674.3999999999996
there

2674.839 --> 2679.599
right and you're gonna have to deal with

2677.359 --> 2679.5989999999997
that

2680.319 --> 2683.359
just because he died doesn't mean it's

2682.0 --> 2686.56
all okay you still

2683.359 --> 2688.56
have to follow the actual advice right

2686.56 --> 2689.839
the teachings that's what you actually

2688.56 --> 2692.48
have to do

2689.839 --> 2693.92
it's not all about him oh thank god he

2692.48 --> 2698.4
died so that

2693.92 --> 2701.6800000000003
we're no longer into trouble no

2698.4 --> 2706.7200000000003
no you're alive you're born

2701.68 --> 2710.48
and so you are put here on this earth

2706.72 --> 2711.1189999999997
with the tests and the paths you have to

2710.48 --> 2713.839
choose

2711.119 --> 2719.839
throughout your life and jesus gave the

2713.839 --> 2719.839
best example

2720.72 --> 2725.839
right yeah good servant jesus beat those

2723.04 --> 2730.839
grabblers by rising from the grave

2725.839 --> 2733.839
or he survived

2730.839 --> 2733.839
them

2734.8 --> 2737.52
how about that

2738.24 --> 2746.0
i maybe jesus grabbled the grabblers

2742.72 --> 2749.4399999999996
again faking his own death so he

2746.0 --> 2754.0
would no longer be subjected

2749.44 --> 2756.079
to the play he was becoming a part of

2754.0 --> 2758.079
not saying he was an actor but the play

2756.079 --> 2760.1600000000003
of just how things unfold over there

2758.079 --> 2763.76
with the roman empire and the

2760.16 --> 2769.359
jew tribes and all that different

2763.76 --> 2769.3590000000004
spiritual teachers philosophies

2770.0 --> 2774.079
and he was maneuvering into a position

2772.48 --> 2778.0
originally where he was just gonna

2774.079 --> 2781.52
totally try to transform everything but

2778.0 --> 2782.48
yeah he got stuck and then clamped down

2781.52 --> 2785.7599999999998
on and like

2782.48 --> 2789.04
he had to go officially

2785.76 --> 2791.44
so he just went with

2789.04 --> 2793.44
a process that would be sufficient for

2791.44 --> 2795.2000000000003
everybody to completely be convinced

2793.44 --> 2795.92
that he was dead because nobody could

2795.2 --> 2801.2799999999997
survive

2795.92 --> 2804.4
going through that what he did

2801.28 --> 2807.6800000000003
and then by doing that he effectively

2804.4 --> 2809.44
seized that momentum

2807.68 --> 2811.9199999999996
that everybody was so afraid of and

2809.44 --> 2814.2400000000002
could move on beyond that

2811.92 --> 2818.16
right that's just one way i look at it

2814.24 --> 2818.16
and i am not afraid to do that

2823.92 --> 2828.88
jesus doesn't grabble

2827.04 --> 2832.079
oh really you think that jesus wouldn't

2828.88 --> 2832.079
grab all the grapplers

2832.64 --> 2839.68
just to show them that actual god is

2835.92 --> 2839.6800000000003
more powerful than a bunch of tricks

2841.119 --> 2846.079
than the ego why wouldn't he

2856.16 --> 2861.52
the [ __ ] will you do what kind of a

2858.72 --> 2861.52
question is that

2864.48 --> 2873.839
he took our punishment away uh really

2868.16 --> 2873.839
who told you that

2882.72 --> 2886.0789999999997
now you can take your own punishment

2884.96 --> 2890.079
away by following

2886.079 --> 2890.079
his example in his way of living

2890.319 --> 2897.7599999999998
to find a way through to find

2893.359 --> 2897.7599999999998
god's blessings through your actions

2898.4 --> 2903.359
and that's how his example can take your

2900.96 --> 2905.359
punishment away

2903.359 --> 2908.24
the punishment that you would naturally

2905.359 --> 2915.839
receive if you would keep dwelling

2908.24 --> 2915.839
into into the darkness and ego thinking

2922.48 --> 2926.2400000000002
yes steamy traveler that's even what i

2924.8 --> 2928.319
got out of it

2926.24 --> 2929.839
it's just that so many christians

2928.319 --> 2931.92
they've been

2929.839 --> 2934.88
conditioned with what i see as a

2931.92 --> 2934.88
priestly trick

2935.44 --> 2940.4
to accept something that's like

2938.2 --> 2942.3999999999996
extraordinary

2940.4 --> 2944.319
and tie it in with a meaning like he

2942.4 --> 2944.64
died for our sins literally that saying

2944.319 --> 2948.4
he

2944.64 --> 2949.2
died for our sins when you take it

2948.4 --> 2951.52
separately

2949.2 --> 2952.64
and you take all the spell and the magic

2951.52 --> 2955.28
away

2952.64 --> 2958.4
it doesn't mean anything it makes no

2955.28 --> 2962.8
sense and like how can you prove that

2958.4 --> 2965.6800000000003
you can't it's esoteric interpretation

2962.8 --> 2967.04
priest machination that's what i think

2965.68 --> 2971.2799999999997
it is

2967.04 --> 2973.119
it's a mind control tool right

2971.28 --> 2975.599
doesn't mean that oh jesus and this is

2973.119 --> 2979.2000000000003
all a mind control tool now that

2975.599 --> 2985.839
specific saying is a priestly tool

2979.2 --> 2985.839
in my opinion

2986.559 --> 2991.28
because where did jesus actually say

2988.96 --> 2991.28
that

2991.52 --> 2998.079
where did jesus say

2994.72 --> 2998.7999999999997
that he was going to die for everybody's

2998.079 --> 3002.4
sins

2998.8 --> 3006.1600000000003
that because he died he would die

3002.4 --> 3009.6800000000003
that it would be a great blessing

3006.16 --> 3012.0789999999997
and transform the world or something

3009.68 --> 3013.5989999999997
and maybe he did give hint at it in a

3012.079 --> 3015.3590000000004
certain way

3013.599 --> 3019.3590000000004
something was going to happen but did he

3015.359 --> 3019.359
say all that specifically

3022.16 --> 3027.839
i'd like to know more about that

3058.88 --> 3067.359
okay apple that's a big question

3063.04 --> 3069.599
needed to be covered right

3067.359 --> 3071.5989999999997
it makes no sense to me the idea of

3069.599 --> 3074.88
sacrifice

3071.599 --> 3077.44
for sin seems

3074.88 --> 3078.1600000000003
yeah well a little demonic to me i don't

3077.44 --> 3080.64
think god

3078.16 --> 3081.2799999999997
requires any of that now things will

3080.64 --> 3083.44
naturally

3081.28 --> 3084.8
transform and unfold in a certain way

3083.44 --> 3087.839
but to then say

3084.8 --> 3097.8390000000004
it like it's a literal sacrifice

3087.839 --> 3097.839
that seems kind of unholy to me

3115.2 --> 3118.64
well good surfing just listen to what

3117.28 --> 3122.1600000000003
you just said i'm not gonna

3118.64 --> 3124.4
get harsh on you right

3122.16 --> 3126.5589999999997
what if you read that metaphorically in

3124.4 --> 3127.359
the context of how i just explained

3126.559 --> 3130.559
things right

3127.359 --> 3132.72
he destroyed their evil plan taking away

3130.559 --> 3134.0
our punishment and coming back to life

3132.72 --> 3136.24
anyway

3134.0 --> 3139.119
right taking it you're saying that in an

3136.24 --> 3144.64
esoteric fashion

3139.119 --> 3144.6400000000003
but now think about his teaching

3145.44 --> 3152.0
his teaching what does his teaching do

3148.8 --> 3155.599
when you follow it doesn't it take away

3152.0 --> 3158.88
our punishment and if somebody

3155.599 --> 3159.599
is like rammed down like attacked from

3158.88 --> 3161.839
the outside

3159.599 --> 3163.28
terrible things happen to them and they

3161.839 --> 3165.44
are trying to do their best

3163.28 --> 3167.0400000000004
and not be vengeful not let it rule

3165.44 --> 3170.16
their life

3167.04 --> 3173.119
how they were destroyed then doesn't

3170.16 --> 3175.2
despair christ spirit come back anyway

3173.119 --> 3179.599
and restore it

3175.2 --> 3181.52
right so you're thinking probably about

3179.599 --> 3182.96
it esoterically but if you think about

3181.52 --> 3185.28
it esoterically

3182.96 --> 3187.839
in relation to what really matters

3185.28 --> 3189.6800000000003
christ's example spiritual example then

3187.839 --> 3195.839
it is

3189.68 --> 3195.839
arguably true from that perspective

3214.8 --> 3219.119
yes i know and it was a highly dubious

3217.68 --> 3221.359
advance event

3219.119 --> 3223.52
when abraham was asked to sacrifice his

3221.359 --> 3227.44
son isaac

3223.52 --> 3227.44
and guess what he was stopped remember

3228.72 --> 3231.9199999999996
because maybe it's not what you think it

3231.44 --> 3234.96
was

3231.92 --> 3237.839
maybe that was simply a test

3234.96 --> 3237.839
like would you

3238.079 --> 3243.3590000000004
do a dark act for your dedication

3243.68 --> 3251.839
but he wasn't supposed to do it

3262.839 --> 3265.839
right

3273.04 --> 3279.92
50 years after well she

3276.079 --> 3283.92
wait but weren't like the scriptures

3279.92 --> 3287.2000000000003
written by the apostles who did know him

3283.92 --> 3289.599
seeking star wars and then later the

3287.2 --> 3290.8799999999997
scriptures were put together turned into

3289.599 --> 3293.76
the bible

3290.88 --> 3295.359
by the council of nicaea and they're the

3293.76 --> 3298.96
ones that didn't actually

3295.359 --> 3307.839
know jesus right

3298.96 --> 3307.839
seeking star wars

3327.599 --> 3337.6800000000003
false history

3334.64 --> 3340.48
i i wouldn't say that

3337.68 --> 3340.48
it's difficult

3342.4 --> 3346.839
right there might have been some events

3344.4 --> 3350.799
like politically maneuvered out of

3346.839 --> 3354.4
existence but it would only be

3350.799 --> 3356.079
chiseling off elements

3354.4 --> 3358.7200000000003
right they would it's not like they were

3356.079 --> 3362.079
gonna totally rearrange

3358.72 --> 3365.359
how events transpired right

3362.079 --> 3367.119
because the the scriptures written by

3365.359 --> 3370.72
the apostles are all

3367.119 --> 3370.7200000000003
too specific for that

3372.16 --> 3376.8799999999997
right so even like the council of nicaea

3375.2 --> 3379.1189999999997
might bite past

3376.88 --> 3381.04
like the core of christ's original

3379.119 --> 3382.0
teachings and turn it into a more

3381.04 --> 3384.319
ecstatic

3382.0 --> 3385.44
interpretation based set up the whole

3384.319 --> 3390.16
thing

3385.44 --> 3392.7200000000003
but i don't think they really changed

3390.16 --> 3392.72
too much

3398.24 --> 3406.799
but it's it's it's complicated very

3402.839 --> 3406.799
complicated i don't have a full

3416.839 --> 3419.839
oversight

3422.079 --> 3427.28
a load tomonoid right away and glad

3430.839 --> 3433.839
flow

3449.119 --> 3451.44
hmm

3456.559 --> 3461.8390000000004
then i see in creed

3476.88 --> 3481.2000000000003
empirical evidence for earth shape and

3478.96 --> 3481.2
what

3486.839 --> 3491.92
okay

3488.799 --> 3495.28
right yeah sleeping work well you know

3491.92 --> 3498.319
sean hawkins and p mars and all that

3495.28 --> 3500.6400000000003
they're probably all on heavy low doses

3498.319 --> 3503.839
dosages of pharmaceuticals and they have

3500.64 --> 3506.24
all kinds of side effects

3503.839 --> 3508.24
so when they go heavy on it they will

3506.24 --> 3516.64
have times where they will be just too

3508.24 --> 3519.7599999999998
knackered and sickly to do anything

3516.64 --> 3522.0789999999997
because both these guys have a lot of

3519.76 --> 3522.079
trouble

3523.2 --> 3528.799
disengaging in mania like once they go

3527.04 --> 3531.2
at it they don't know how to stop

3528.799 --> 3533.2
they don't know their limits right so

3531.2 --> 3536.0
they're yeah

3533.2 --> 3536.72
because of that their actual presence is

3536.0 --> 3539.76
going to be

3536.72 --> 3541.2
kind of sporadic thankfully

3539.76 --> 3545.8390000000004
because you don't really want them

3541.2 --> 3545.839
around all the time

3553.599 --> 3559.44
hey and they may still be

3556.64 --> 3561.68
like maneuvering in here through sock

3559.44 --> 3564.2400000000002
accounts right

3561.68 --> 3565.359
or at least p mars would would do that i

3564.24 --> 3573.839
don't know if shotguns

3565.359 --> 3573.839
even knows how to do that really

3583.119 --> 3587.839
the early worm catches the bird

3604.799 --> 3608.079
oh racist

3611.76 --> 3615.8390000000004
oh he seems to be acting like that yeah

3638.799 --> 3644.72
why are there no atheist flat earthers

3641.28 --> 3644.7200000000003
oh that's a good question

3645.599 --> 3649.599
requires some elaborate answering

3649.76 --> 3655.119
it's because flat earthers allow

3652.4 --> 3658.4
themselves to figure out the realm

3655.119 --> 3661.599
that it's actually flat bypassing

3658.4 --> 3663.28
assumption based thinking from the

3661.599 --> 3665.839
mainstream

3663.28 --> 3665.8390000000004
teachings

3666.319 --> 3673.119
and that will then inevitably lead

3670.559 --> 3674.96
if your curiosity reaches that far to

3673.119 --> 3676.0
the conclusion that it must have all

3674.96 --> 3678.0
been created

3676.0 --> 3680.079
ontological primitive and just the

3678.0 --> 3684.559
design of things right

3680.079 --> 3687.44
how illusion is such nonsense

3684.559 --> 3689.52
so that's why there's very few flat

3687.44 --> 3691.119
earthers that end up actually staying

3689.52 --> 3694.16
atheist

3691.119 --> 3695.52
because they figure they are able to

3694.16 --> 3698.64
figure out that

3695.52 --> 3700.799
very substance of reality could only

3698.64 --> 3704.8799999999997
have been designed

3700.799 --> 3707.68
and even our consciousness is

3704.88 --> 3708.96
preceded by the spirit of god who

3707.68 --> 3711.839
foresaw it all and

3708.96 --> 3713.359
and that's not just a vague esoteric

3711.839 --> 3718.96
saying no that's

3713.359 --> 3722.4
actually a mechanical inevitable truth

3718.96 --> 3726.16
and you figure out all those things

3722.4 --> 3728.4
once you pass the flatter station

3726.16 --> 3741.839
that's why there's so few atheists among

3728.4 --> 3741.839
flat earthers

3752.839 --> 3757.839
hello

3755.599 --> 3759.52
why aren't there any religious well well

3757.839 --> 3762.0789999999997
there are sleeping warrior

3759.52 --> 3762.079
there are

3762.799 --> 3768.559
like kent hovind he's

3766.24 --> 3769.68
firmly holding onto that ball even would

3768.559 --> 3772.48
bring up

3769.68 --> 3775.7599999999998
by his own volition the molten iron core

3772.48 --> 3777.52
he actually believes that

3775.76 --> 3779.44
i remember that because i was there

3777.52 --> 3783.68
during a livestream

3779.44 --> 3786.96
so yeah there are religious ballers

3783.68 --> 3790.8799999999997
right the ball is easier to hold on to

3786.96 --> 3793.44
for the earth shape than the rest of all

3790.88 --> 3797.839
things and the nature of life

3793.44 --> 3797.839
and all that

3815.599 --> 3820.0
oh really sleeping well can you prove

3817.92 --> 3825.839
that

3820.0 --> 3825.839
can you prove that

3827.039 --> 3832.0
like look if somebody is going to have

3829.599 --> 3833.839
some kind of revelation

3832.0 --> 3835.44
like a rough comparison let's just say

3833.839 --> 3839.119
with joe rogan

3835.44 --> 3841.039
right joe rogan at some point he

3839.119 --> 3843.039
started to take the moon landing on the

3841.039 --> 3844.7200000000003
loop and i thought like yeah this is

3843.039 --> 3846.96
nonsense and then pointed out

3844.72 --> 3848.8799999999997
legitimate observations as to how it's

3846.96 --> 3852.0
nonsense

3848.88 --> 3855.92
and then neil degrasse tyson comes for

3852.0 --> 3858.0
a visit blah blah blah rogan changes his

3855.92 --> 3859.44
attitude and suddenly he believes in the

3858.0 --> 3862.559
moon landing right

3859.44 --> 3864.2400000000002
now there you know

3862.559 --> 3866.96
that he knows because he gave the right

3864.24 --> 3870.4799999999996
arguments against the moon landing right

3866.96 --> 3873.119
well i haven't seen kent hovind do that

3870.48 --> 3873.92
i think he he always was a ball believer

3873.119 --> 3881.6800000000003
and he never

3873.92 --> 3885.92
allowed himself to consider flat earth

3881.68 --> 3885.9199999999996
i've never heard him actually address

3886.0 --> 3892.4
flat earth in a way that he could

3889.92 --> 3893.76
that he was in the middle of the

3892.4 --> 3896.0
discovery of it

3893.76 --> 3909.8390000000004
and then retracted he never did that i

3896.0 --> 3909.839
never heard him do that

3923.76 --> 3930.6400000000003
no no sleeping worry look

3927.44 --> 3933.68
don't don't let him be he's

3930.64 --> 3936.48
he's gaslight baiting you look look at

3933.68 --> 3938.5589999999997
what he said

3936.48 --> 3939.52
isn't your position that everything was

3938.559 --> 3942.799
created

3939.52 --> 3945.7599999999998
by magic from nothing

3942.799 --> 3945.7599999999998
by the creator

3949.28 --> 3955.92
well do you or don't we know

3952.72 --> 3958.319
right but most most

3955.92 --> 3958.96
things that we know the earth realm and

3958.319 --> 3960.96
life

3958.96 --> 3962.48
the designs of life yeah that was

3960.96 --> 3964.96
created by the creator

3962.48 --> 3967.52
and it is magical because we don't

3964.96 --> 3970.799
understand how that works

3967.52 --> 3973.0389999999998
but it has to be like that so yeah

3970.799 --> 3974.96
in a way you do actually believe that no

3973.039 --> 3976.2400000000002
maybe not specifically right depends

3974.96 --> 3977.92
like do you think that the creator

3976.24 --> 3981.0389999999998
created it literally where nothing

3977.92 --> 3984.799
existed he created the material realm

3981.039 --> 3988.96
or did he get into the material realm

3984.799 --> 3991.119
and then kind of made things with it

3988.96 --> 3992.559
right that that remains open what

3991.119 --> 3993.44
position you're gonna take in that but

3992.559 --> 3996.1600000000003
other than that

3993.44 --> 3997.92
what he said yeah he's trying to like oh

3996.16 --> 4000.799
do you believe in magic it's like

3997.92 --> 4002.559
yeah it is [ __ ] magical [ __ ] it is

4000.799 --> 4005.52
really magical

4002.559 --> 4006.079
it's god it's divine it's unbelievable

4005.52 --> 4009.0389999999998
it's way

4006.079 --> 4009.92
beyond the regular human comprehension

4009.039 --> 4011.599
that's right

4009.92 --> 4014.319
there's nothing to be ashamed about in

4011.599 --> 4014.319
believing that

4015.039 --> 4022.2400000000002
the alternatives have been lacking

4019.2 --> 4022.24
severely so

4032.96 --> 4035.839
all right

4037.599 --> 4040.6400000000003
oh what's the difference between god

4039.28 --> 4042.6400000000003
creating everything

4040.64 --> 4044.8799999999997
by magic and everything creating by a

4042.64 --> 4049.2799999999997
big bang was very simple

4044.88 --> 4051.839
god is a spirit is an intelligence

4049.28 --> 4053.92
he was that he didn't manifest afterward

4051.839 --> 4056.16
he is the intelligence he is the

4053.92 --> 4060.88
designer

4056.16 --> 4063.92
a big bang is an explosion

4060.88 --> 4067.6800000000003
literally it's a physical process an

4063.92 --> 4070.4
explosion explosions are not

4067.68 --> 4070.3999999999996
intelligent

4070.799 --> 4076.0
they're not living they're just a

4074.0 --> 4079.52
reaction how is the reaction

4076.0 --> 4080.88
supposed to manifest all this without an

4079.52 --> 4083.839
intelligence

4080.88 --> 4085.839
guiding it even if you would presume the

4083.839 --> 4091.359
big bang would be true in some way

4085.839 --> 4094.0
right that's the point

4091.359 --> 4097.199
you don't blow something up and then

4094.0 --> 4101.679
find that out of the explosion

4097.199 --> 4101.678999999999
something complicated is designed

4101.759 --> 4106.08
where before it wasn't there that

4103.359 --> 4106.08
doesn't happen

4113.759 --> 4119.6
yeah when the dust of an explosion

4116.799 --> 4124.0
settles it doesn't

4119.6 --> 4127.359
come together and then form shapes

4124.0 --> 4128.56
no it just spreads out evenly and then

4127.359 --> 4131.759
stays that way

4128.56 --> 4133.4400000000005
cools down perhaps will tighten in

4131.759 --> 4135.6
density

4133.44 --> 4138.3189999999995
will become thinner but it's not going

4135.6 --> 4143.1990000000005
to clog together

4138.319 --> 4147.839000000001
and then form earthly bodies

4143.199 --> 4147.839
or gas balls even weirder

4172.48 --> 4177.2789999999995
if you were in india the release would

4174.56 --> 4181.04
be oh why don't you ask terry 306

4177.279 --> 4183.279
tiny wumbo because

4181.04 --> 4184.64
territory oh he's not here right now i

4183.279 --> 4187.1990000000005
think

4184.64 --> 4188.88
but he's pretty much with most of what

4187.199 --> 4192.239
i've said

4188.88 --> 4194.32
like tara 306 has been like really on

4192.239 --> 4200.159
top

4194.32 --> 4200.159
of what i do he's very ascended

4201.76 --> 4205.4400000000005
and i foresaw this happening

4206.159 --> 4212.4
because the teachings in india

4209.199 --> 4214.639999999999
have are valuable too

4212.4 --> 4216.879999999999
like their ancient religions contain a

4214.64 --> 4220.400000000001
lot of wisdom as well

4216.88 --> 4220.400000000001
it's it's a similar test

4220.56 --> 4231.84
test of ascension

4233.12 --> 4236.239
that's one person of the country in

4235.36 --> 4239.04
general

4236.239 --> 4240.159
we'll talk about over generalization he

4239.04 --> 4245.84
lives there

4240.159 --> 4245.839999999999
he was born there

4253.28 --> 4257.759999999999
right we were talking about beliefs

4255.04 --> 4260.239
right so he is actually he has actually

4257.76 --> 4260.2390000000005
studied

4260.88 --> 4264.0
their beliefs

4265.28 --> 4272.159
and found similar conclusions as to what

4268.0 --> 4274.239
i've concluded so

4272.159 --> 4275.36
right now what the rest of that country

4274.239 --> 4277.48
believes

4275.36 --> 4278.719
yeah india has a lot of people that

4277.48 --> 4282.799999999999
really

4278.719 --> 4285.52
really like the virtual signal to

4282.8 --> 4286.0
like the western ideas and [ __ ] they

4285.52 --> 4289.4400000000005
want to be

4286.0 --> 4290.0
more western than the west some of the

4289.44 --> 4291.839999999999
people

4290.0 --> 4294.08
it's a cultural thing they've always had

4291.84 --> 4294.08
that

4296.4 --> 4300.639999999999
but they those people in turn also

4299.92 --> 4304.08
typically

4300.64 --> 4307.6
ignore the ancient teachings of their

4304.08 --> 4307.6
own country and their own people

4312.84 --> 4318.56
right

4314.719 --> 4329.84
it's atheists india has atheists

4318.56 --> 4329.84
lots of them

4343.12 --> 4349.36
if god had the power to create the flat

4345.6 --> 4353.76
earth and why didn't he build a planet

4349.36 --> 4356.4
oh well if

4353.76 --> 4358.2390000000005
the heliocentric model could have been

4356.4 --> 4360.639999999999
physically created

4358.239 --> 4362.239
then god would have probably done it

4360.64 --> 4366.320000000001
here's the thing though

4362.239 --> 4371.12
he can't god can't do that because

4366.32 --> 4375.92
god can't create things

4371.12 --> 4375.92
that cannot physically exist right

4382.96 --> 4387.36
you can't create something that's

4385.04 --> 4390.64
impossible

4387.36 --> 4391.36
it would not last like he might for a

4390.64 --> 4393.76
glimpse

4391.36 --> 4394.5599999999995
momentary glimpse be able to assemble

4393.76 --> 4396.320000000001
everything that

4394.56 --> 4398.400000000001
would be a planet would have gas guess

4396.32 --> 4400.48
what so as time starts running

4398.4 --> 4402.0
the gas explodes into the vacuum of

4400.48 --> 4405.12
space

4402.0 --> 4406.56
probably like gravity whatever it's

4405.12 --> 4409.44
supposed to be like

4406.56 --> 4410.96
no it would all break apart because it's

4409.44 --> 4414.879999999999
not

4410.96 --> 4416.159
physically sustainable the heliocentric

4414.88 --> 4419.4400000000005
model is simply not

4416.159 --> 4421.839999999999
physically sustainable even if

4419.44 --> 4424.32
for some reason in some parallel

4421.84 --> 4426.88
universe idea it would be real

4424.32 --> 4429.599999999999
right it's a fantasy that's being

4426.88 --> 4429.6
reified

4432.8 --> 4440.159000000001
like god cannot make an illusion real

4436.239 --> 4441.36
in the physical world can only make real

4440.159 --> 4445.679
things real

4441.36 --> 4455.839999999999
things that can be based on physical

4445.679 --> 4455.84
nature and logic

4469.44 --> 4472.239
what the [ __ ]

4479.12 --> 4486.48
dude don't don't tell us

4482.64 --> 4488.08
blasphemy and then talking about trash

4486.48 --> 4489.759999999999
from the desert back in the day

4488.08 --> 4491.5199999999995
seriously when you read what you're

4489.76 --> 4497.84
saying

4491.52 --> 4497.84
the [ __ ] wrong with you

4500.4 --> 4506.4
write your own destiny uh

4504.719 --> 4509.12
yeah but how are you gonna write it if

4506.4 --> 4512.799999999999
you don't know the rules

4509.12 --> 4515.84
right rules of creation the design

4512.8 --> 4518.400000000001
how it was designed

4515.84 --> 4519.1990000000005
right you can't write a story unless you

4518.4 --> 4522.5599999999995
know

4519.199 --> 4522.5599999999995
about how things work

4523.36 --> 4527.679
unless you understand the story of

4525.84 --> 4530.32
people's lives

4527.679 --> 4532.32
how things unfold because then you can

4530.32 --> 4533.92
draw in things that would sympathize it

4532.32 --> 4535.759999999999
would echo with other people and then

4533.92 --> 4537.04
you can have a good story

4535.76 --> 4538.8
right then you can write your own

4537.04 --> 4540.96
destiny perhaps

4538.8 --> 4542.64
lay out a path for yourself but yeah you

4540.96 --> 4543.199
need a good example for that because

4542.64 --> 4548.08
you're not

4543.199 --> 4548.08
born understanding how everything works

4550.84 --> 4553.84
completely

4562.08 --> 4566.08
i make more credible claims than the

4564.84 --> 4570.400000000001
book

4566.08 --> 4572.96
that's because i read

4570.4 --> 4575.36
big part of the book and especially

4572.96 --> 4577.28
through other people

4575.36 --> 4579.12
and understand what it really is and

4577.28 --> 4583.44
then you can move on

4579.12 --> 4583.44
with it with it with its knowledge

4588.0 --> 4594.56
that's saying something right

4591.28 --> 4597.12
but look when you say that oh i have

4594.56 --> 4601.679
more credible claims than the book

4597.12 --> 4604.719
well maybe you misunderstood the book

4601.679 --> 4608.08
right what you bring to the book will

4604.719 --> 4611.92
be found whether it is delusional or not

4608.08 --> 4611.92
right this is really about your mindset

4612.88 --> 4623.84
because it's all a test

4656.64 --> 4665.84
what you're blocked no you're not

4686.159 --> 4690.48
dude if you're going to be blocked i'll

4687.6 --> 4693.6
tell you and i'll warn you ahead of time

4690.48 --> 4696.159
if i think that you're

4693.6 --> 4696.159000000001
pushing it

4701.44 --> 4704.799999999999
all right well thanks for that i

4703.52 --> 4706.96
appreciate the compliment

4704.8 --> 4709.4400000000005
i don't really need any reassurances

4706.96 --> 4711.44
though i'm pretty solid about my case

4709.44 --> 4714.48
and my positions

4711.44 --> 4714.48
i know what i'm doing

4716.239 --> 4721.839999999999
i appreciate you like the show

4723.04 --> 4726.64
it's just that when if people say like

4726.159 --> 4728.639999999999
oh

4726.64 --> 4730.719
this makes more sense than the bible

4728.64 --> 4732.08
then i'd say oh really so how did you

4730.719 --> 4734.08
read it

4732.08 --> 4735.6
did you read it with all the exoteric

4734.08 --> 4739.76
priestly programming

4735.6 --> 4742.4800000000005
that people have inputted alongside it

4739.76 --> 4743.6
in a consistent way or did you

4742.48 --> 4746.639999999999
completely

4743.6 --> 4747.76
wipe that all out and read it exactly as

4746.64 --> 4751.52
you are

4747.76 --> 4754.08
with an open mind right trying to figure

4751.52 --> 4756.400000000001
out more of the esoterics of the actual

4754.08 --> 4759.28
people there

4756.4 --> 4763.839999999999
in how they were in that time how

4759.28 --> 4763.84
everything was

4766.08 --> 4771.5199999999995
right i'll be back in two minutes and

4768.4 --> 4771.5199999999995
i'm gonna round out the show

4774.84 --> 4777.84
soon

4858.84 --> 4861.84
so

4872.84 --> 4875.84
uh

4886.84 --> 4892.400000000001
hmm

4889.679 --> 4895.12
there would be didn't real there is no

4892.4 --> 4903.839999999999
bible bashing here it's flat

4895.12 --> 4903.84
absolutely not

4907.12 --> 4914.88
no it's it's i tried to

4910.639 --> 4917.1990000000005
erase some of the exoteric mechanisms

4914.88 --> 4921.28
that have come from the priesthoods

4917.199 --> 4923.36
of the ages since the bible

4921.28 --> 4925.44
first yeah well since jesus came into

4923.36 --> 4927.759999999999
being right

4925.44 --> 4929.44
because the bible and the teachings and

4927.76 --> 4931.92
the path yeah that's

4929.44 --> 4932.5599999999995
that's not up for debate as far as i'm

4931.92 --> 4936.0
concerned

4932.56 --> 4936.400000000001
like i know what that is you can ignore

4936.0 --> 4939.76
it

4936.4 --> 4939.759999999999
or not be able to see it

4941.199 --> 4947.678999999999
but a lot of things of how it's been

4945.12 --> 4950.639
taught to think about it

4947.679 --> 4953.6
like this is what it is this is how a

4950.639 --> 4956.88
christian thinks about it right all that

4953.6 --> 4959.04
everybody echoes that but

4956.88 --> 4960.0
a lot of it all ends up in just these

4959.04 --> 4963.28
exoteric

4960.0 --> 4965.76
puzzles when you really just

4963.28 --> 4966.719
think about what it says it doesn't make

4965.76 --> 4969.12
any actual

4966.719 --> 4972.719
sense there's it's it's basically

4969.12 --> 4975.84
magical thinking

4972.719 --> 4976.4
and a lot of people that do follow the

4975.84 --> 4980.0
bible

4976.4 --> 4982.719
hold on to those they've been feared

4980.0 --> 4983.92
into doing that they have to think like

4982.719 --> 4984.84
that or they're not going to go to

4983.92 --> 4988.32
heaven like you

4984.84 --> 4990.08
must believe

4988.32 --> 4992.5599999999995
he died for our sins and this and that

4990.08 --> 4994.48
or you go or it's not going to work for

4992.56 --> 4997.04
you and then you're not a christian that

4994.48 --> 5001.36
now that's an esoteric mechanism that's

4997.04 --> 5004.639
a priestly mind control device

5001.36 --> 5007.92
saying that that

5004.639 --> 5011.76
jesus christ himself in the bible

5007.92 --> 5011.76
teaches against that

5012.08 --> 5016.32
all right and explains exactly how yet

5014.96 --> 5018.56
christians a lot of them

5016.32 --> 5020.239
do that because it's a priestly mind

5018.56 --> 5022.4800000000005
control device

5020.239 --> 5023.599999999999
that's been handed down it's been taught

5022.48 --> 5027.5199999999995
to them

5023.6 --> 5029.76
by priests that do that

5027.52 --> 5031.120000000001
think it's okay or it's normal or that's

5029.76 --> 5033.679
what else are they gonna do

5031.12 --> 5037.5199999999995
but it's actually in contradiction with

5033.679 --> 5037.52
what jesus christ himself taught

5038.96 --> 5042.56
right so i'm there's no bible bashing

5041.04 --> 5045.84
here

5042.56 --> 5050.159000000001
no it's the false teachers

5045.84 --> 5050.159000000001
the false teachings the priesthood

5051.84 --> 5058.639
people teaching things about it

5055.76 --> 5060.96
that contradict what jesus himself

5058.639 --> 5060.96
taught

5066.96 --> 5070.2390000000005
right okay good servant i'm glad to have

5069.12 --> 5071.76

5070.239 --> 5074.239

5071.76 --> 5077.84
much better and back at home

5074.239 --> 5080.5599999999995

5077.84 --> 5080.56

i think i'm gonna round out the show

5093.12 --> 5097.5199999999995
false teachers need to be bashed no no

5095.28 --> 5101.199
no they need to be

5097.52 --> 5103.1990000000005
challenged and then their argument

5101.199 --> 5104.32
dismantled neutralized they don't need

5103.199 --> 5107.759999999999
to be bashed

5104.32 --> 5107.759999999999
