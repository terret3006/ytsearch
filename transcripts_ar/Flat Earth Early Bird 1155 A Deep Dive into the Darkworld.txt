because still broke uh I haven't eaten

91.32 --> 95.27999999999999
much

93.299 --> 97.43900000000001
right

95.28 --> 99.96000000000001
uh

97.439 --> 102.0
the weather today is yeah unfortunately

99.96 --> 103.759
not so beautiful as it was yesterday

102.0 --> 107.78
it's

103.759 --> 107.78
seems to be all trailed up

108.84 --> 115.46000000000001
and yeah there's still a lot of wind

112.079 --> 115.46
and it's cold wind

118.2 --> 122.06
a particularly Pleasant outside

125.64 --> 130.319
yeah without that sun

127.86 --> 132.18
it's not all that great

130.319 --> 134.28
I mean when the sun was there yesterday

132.18 --> 136.14000000000001
that was great

134.28 --> 138.78
as soon as that went away it got really

136.14 --> 140.64
cold or well not really cold it's just

138.78 --> 141.599
that in the wind you cool off very

140.64 --> 144.0
quickly

141.599 --> 146.57999999999998
anyway

144.0 --> 149.58
hello gaining wisdom first in chat Jeff

146.58 --> 152.22
gashead Kevlar

149.58 --> 154.37900000000002
huh I'm starting my show on time today

152.22 --> 157.019
how about that right

154.379 --> 161.17999999999998
must have been like

157.019 --> 161.18
half a year ago since that last happened

163.26 --> 168.35999999999999
right

164.4 --> 170.519
but it was up pretty early today and

168.36 --> 173.28
yeah I don't know though I feel a bit

170.519 --> 176.34
weird

173.28 --> 179.099
got this weird

176.34 --> 180.3
there's no tension but it's like a

179.099 --> 183.83999999999997
little

180.3 --> 184.92000000000002
micro cramp type feelings in my lower

183.84 --> 187.44
gut

184.92 --> 190.64
it's a very odd type of feeling that

187.44 --> 190.64
doesn't happen often

192.599 --> 196.73899999999998
I am very hungry though

194.7 --> 199.2
so yeah I'm kind of looking forward to

196.739 --> 202.739
lunch after this

199.2 --> 202.73899999999998
right anyway

204.54 --> 207.44
how are you all doing

210.239 --> 214.08
right yeah yesterday I rounded out the

212.7 --> 215.64
show early because I thought that

214.08 --> 216.959
there's going to be a giant Premiere

215.64 --> 220.85999999999999
well

216.959 --> 222.659
I was wrong I jumped the gun or

220.86 --> 225.0
break

222.659 --> 227.39999999999998
was just as short

225.0 --> 229.26
kind of stupid of me it was a really fun

227.4 --> 233.519
short though

229.26 --> 235.2
but yeah short show yesterday and maybe

233.519 --> 238.14000000000001
today

235.2 --> 241.439
I'm gonna try to do a little longer if I

238.14 --> 243.54
yeah got the spirit for it

241.439 --> 247.099
because I am slightly demoralized

243.54 --> 247.099
because of my financial situation

249.54 --> 255.54
right

251.159 --> 258.419
at a ball busters yesterday was good

255.54 --> 260.4
I wasn't Super Active on it

258.419 --> 262.5
because it was mainly just talking about

260.4 --> 264.65999999999997
what happened on Friday and all that and

262.5 --> 268.199
like yeah it can't really add something

264.66 --> 272.1
new I already added that on Friday

268.199 --> 273.36
but after the show ended I pretty much

272.1 --> 276.84000000000003
had a

273.36 --> 279.06
two maybe three hour

276.84 --> 281.28
conversation back and forth with a whole

279.06 --> 284.16
bunch of guys on Discord that were still

281.28 --> 285.71999999999997
hanging around and at least G oh by the

284.16 --> 288.139
way also popped by in there that was

285.72 --> 288.139
kind of fun

288.78 --> 291.979
but uh yeah

299.22 --> 302.34000000000003
things could be worse I could be a

300.72 --> 305.1
sphere but Earth believer

302.34 --> 307.73999999999995
well really in reality it's not all that

305.1 --> 309.3
bad being one it's just kind of a burden

307.74 --> 312.08
on everybody else

309.3 --> 312.08
in a way

313.02 --> 318.78
but being one isn't really all that bad

315.3 --> 322.08
I mean ignorance is bliss it usually

318.78 --> 323.28
ends bad but while you are ignorant it

322.08 --> 325.139
is bliss

323.28 --> 328.85999999999996
right that's what makes it appealing

325.139 --> 330.36
that's what makes people choose that

328.86 --> 333.08000000000004
but anyway

330.36 --> 333.08000000000004
uh

335.46 --> 339.919
there's a lot of stuff happening out

337.259 --> 339.91900000000004
there in the world

340.68 --> 343.46
apparently

344.22 --> 348.32000000000005
there's a lot of trickery going on with

346.32 --> 350.639
the whole trucker thing and it's it

348.32 --> 352.259
unrolled differently from what I

350.639 --> 355.56
expected

352.259 --> 358.68
so I fail I like I got it

355.56 --> 361.08
I got a vision break maybe that's why my

358.68 --> 362.819
lower gut kind of hurts a bit because I

361.08 --> 365.58
realized that

362.819 --> 368.22
like I think I've been

365.58 --> 372.8
rolling on a wrong track

368.22 --> 372.8
I've sized up the situation incorrectly

372.9 --> 378.38
and I'm kind of disappointed and myself

380.16 --> 382.699
right

384.479 --> 388.62
but yeah there's weird [ __ ] going down

386.699 --> 389.819
there's like truckers here in the

388.62 --> 391.919
Netherlands

389.819 --> 394.5
and there's like trickery going on

391.919 --> 397.08
because apparently somebody here

394.5 --> 398.88
and then hake like offered the truckers

397.08 --> 399.96
like oh yeah just park your truck over

398.88 --> 402.96
here

399.96 --> 405.479
for the night like oh you will help you

402.96 --> 406.919
out and then they proceed to basically

405.479 --> 411.44
lock it down

406.919 --> 411.44
so they're like holding them hostage

411.9 --> 415.46
it's really freaky

416.819 --> 424.08000000000004
they're they're being held hostage on

419.699 --> 426.3
corporate ground it's like what the [ __ ]

424.08 --> 430.8
so yeah check it out I don't know you

426.3 --> 432.24
probably can't read Dutch but this is

430.8 --> 435.5
a link

432.24 --> 435.5
to that situation

435.72 --> 439.52000000000004
it's it's quite idiotic

439.62 --> 444.18
and it yeah well and it's not what I

442.86 --> 446.22
expected

444.18 --> 449.039
it's

446.22 --> 451.319
I mean I knew

449.039 --> 453.84
it was probably it like the whole thing

451.319 --> 456.78000000000003
is probably not gonna roll out in a DOT

453.84 --> 459.84
right it's more like a a signal like oh

456.78 --> 462.84
we need to do this but

459.84 --> 464.94
what is happening what is transpiring it

462.84 --> 466.5
doesn't feel like it's gonna work

464.94 --> 468.979
because the governments that are doing

466.5 --> 472.319
this

468.979 --> 475.74
this whole lockdown [ __ ] and everything

472.319 --> 477.599
like they don't respond to protests they

475.74 --> 479.22
are the Communists and it's the

477.599 --> 482.58
Communists that have actually been

479.22 --> 484.97900000000004
organizing protests that's what they do

482.58 --> 487.19899999999996
and they've probably been doing it from

484.979 --> 488.639
the start I think that protesting is

487.199 --> 491.879
actually more

488.639 --> 494.699
a communist tool that we thought

491.879 --> 496.56
was a public tool it's always being

494.699 --> 498.78000000000003
manipulated because whenever a protest

496.56 --> 501.18
happens that does not

498.78 --> 503.87899999999996
follow in suit with like globalist

501.18 --> 506.34000000000003
agenda it doesn't get support it doesn't

503.879 --> 508.68
get media coverage and it kind of

506.34 --> 510.78
Fizzles away

508.68 --> 512.399
and like isn't even officially

510.78 --> 515.5799999999999
registered as something that happened

512.399 --> 517.86
like all the people in that system just

515.58 --> 520.2
forget about it they literally wipe it

517.86 --> 522.419
from their minds like Ballers hearing an

520.2 --> 525.8000000000001
argument that they can't place

522.419 --> 525.8
in their defense of the ball

531.06 --> 535.8
right so I kind of felt ahead of time

533.1 --> 538.26
like it's gonna be a dud

535.8 --> 541.019
and that's partially why I've been so

538.26 --> 544.019
aggressive I've been kind of harping on

541.019 --> 545.82
things like vigilantism although now I

544.019 --> 549.68
feel like

545.82 --> 549.6800000000001
like I failed at that as well

549.839 --> 552.5600000000001
I mean

555.6 --> 560.4590000000001
all that it wasn't because I want to

558.48 --> 562.62
destroy everything it's because I

560.459 --> 565.14
genuinely feel like that might have been

562.62 --> 567.72
like the only chance to actually do

565.14 --> 570.72
anything and I feel like all these

567.72 --> 574.94
assumptions that people are using

570.72 --> 574.94
not to do it are

575.3 --> 583.04
controlled misleading

578.94 --> 583.0400000000001
like they've been handed to you

583.08 --> 587.64
to hold on to

584.88 --> 590.279
I felt like this is a trap it's like a

587.64 --> 593.459
we're being kept in a cage

590.279 --> 595.56
of civil behavior and they're using it

593.459 --> 599.04
against us

595.56 --> 601.92
and you can't really then break it

599.04 --> 604.26
break that civil nature

601.92 --> 607.019
to get back

604.26 --> 610.2
at them because usually what it ends up

607.019 --> 614.16
with is a new Tyrant takes over

610.2 --> 615.839
and that's kind of been my loose end in

614.16 --> 619.079
my vision

615.839 --> 621.6800000000001
on it it because it had a loose end it's

619.079 --> 621.68
just that

632.88 --> 637.26
I feel like I've I've truly arrived at

635.88 --> 638.279
the point where I can't handle it

637.26 --> 641.519
anymore

638.279 --> 643.68
you know that that Trope that Alex Jones

641.519 --> 645.9590000000001
says all the time God had a little well

643.68 --> 648.56
I feel that I actually cannot handle it

645.959 --> 648.56
anymore now

654.18 --> 658.7399999999999
like I feel like I'm even

656.399 --> 661.399
kind of losing cognitive grip and that's

658.74 --> 661.399
something that

662.1 --> 665.839
that rarely happens really

667.019 --> 671.899
I don't know what to do about the entire

669.0 --> 671.899
situation anymore

681.959 --> 686.4799999999999
right and I don't want to give you some

684.36 --> 689.64
false

686.48 --> 693.12
vigilante rage fantasy like

689.64 --> 695.279
some substitute for a Hollywood action

693.12 --> 697.2
movie I don't want to do that either I

695.279 --> 701.06
don't want to draw you into an illusion

697.2 --> 701.0600000000001
that I'm creating for myself and you

704.16 --> 710.639
I thought that I could do this and

707.339 --> 712.3800000000001
perhaps change something like change

710.639 --> 715.019
something in the spirit of people that

712.38 --> 717.48
they understand like

715.019 --> 720.36
you're actually expected to be able to

717.48 --> 721.86
cross certain borders on a flash in the

720.36 --> 725.1
moment

721.86 --> 731.42
like are you ready to to actually engage

725.1 --> 731.4200000000001
in in real war on the like suddenly

736.44 --> 742.139
maybe maybe that communication has been

739.92 --> 745.3199999999999
successful though

742.139 --> 747.899
I've certainly seen a lot of like

745.32 --> 750.72
alertness in people it's weird because

747.899 --> 752.7
Alex Jones had a presentation yesterday

750.72 --> 754.6800000000001
a Saturday night

752.7 --> 757.8000000000001
special broadcast

754.68 --> 760.1999999999999
and he literally just said it like yeah

757.8 --> 762.899
I'm for this and that and even like we

760.2 --> 764.88
might have to get pretty rough but not

762.899 --> 768.3
vigilanteism so it's almost like he's

764.88 --> 770.16
been listening and he's like no no no

768.3 --> 772.079
and he's been doing that kind of for a

770.16 --> 774.56
while it's becoming more direct and I

772.079 --> 774.56
feel like

775.019 --> 778.579
I feel like I failed

780.0 --> 786.36
I was really hoping that just

783.3 --> 787.5
a huge amount of people would literally

786.36 --> 790.6800000000001
stand up

787.5 --> 795.36
and finish it

790.68 --> 796.8
and now I just feel like that's not this

795.36 --> 800.16
world

796.8 --> 802.26
it and that to me kind of makes it more

800.16 --> 805.56
like I'm

802.26 --> 808.8
like this is really hell like it can't

805.56 --> 811.399
work the way it's supposed to be working

808.8 --> 811.399
Direct

811.44 --> 816.48
in this world

813.72 --> 819.72
so everybody is

816.48 --> 822.5600000000001
and prison basically to not be able to

819.72 --> 822.5600000000001
function naturally

831.839 --> 836.4200000000001
hey flatten the curtain what are you

833.94 --> 836.4200000000001
talking about

839.88 --> 843.12
no no I'm not gonna wheel the freaking

842.16 --> 844.62
gun

843.12 --> 847.019
dude

844.62 --> 850.32
like people that are

847.019 --> 853.92
raging and all that they shouldn't have

850.32 --> 855.839
that in my opinion or I don't feel fit

853.92 --> 858.24
to have that

855.839 --> 860.2790000000001
right I'm not over compensating because

858.24 --> 863.779
I'm afraid

860.279 --> 867.3
I'm not safe I feel actually really safe

863.779 --> 869.16
physically economically not I don't feel

867.3 --> 872.399
economically safe

869.16 --> 876.3
and the Netherlands is in a big

872.399 --> 878.699
like sliding slope financially it used

876.3 --> 881.519
to be great and now they're literally

878.699 --> 883.3199999999999
wrecking our economy they're on purpose

881.519 --> 887.04
Wrecking

883.32 --> 889.2600000000001
a a peak moment where it was great and

887.04 --> 891.8389999999999
like all everything was

889.26 --> 894.74
set straight and now they're ruining it

891.839 --> 894.74
on purpose

911.899 --> 916.019
sorry dude I'm not leaving my country

914.339 --> 918.32
flatten the curve but thanks for the

916.019 --> 918.32
offer

918.48 --> 921.6800000000001
hello by the way dank

926.579 --> 931.04
many guns okay cool good for you

940.56 --> 946.199
but yeah

942.54 --> 948.18
I'm I'm actually I'm trying to let go of

946.199 --> 951.18
my anger because

948.18 --> 953.699
I saw that first

951.18 --> 957.66
that it had a purpose I have a reason to

953.699 --> 961.88
be angry from God it's it's designed I

957.66 --> 961.88
have it I have it but

961.92 --> 965.579
I feel

963.959 --> 969.0
like

965.579 --> 971.7589999999999
it's not work it's not worked out

969.0 --> 974.0
maybe it's just like a mood thing I

971.759 --> 974.0
don't know

974.579 --> 979.2199999999999
maybe it's not having eaten enough

979.8 --> 984.2589999999999
not really having smoked anything

1002.72 --> 1009.86
all right yeah and by the way Kevlar

1005.6 --> 1012.62
like nobody gives a [ __ ] about their

1009.86 --> 1015.32
there yeah what is it

1012.62 --> 1018.199
uh they're blatant

1015.32 --> 1020.24
in your face hypocrisy like that's just

1018.199 --> 1023.42
that's just the way it is they are

1020.24 --> 1026.0
hypocrites they are communists

1023.42 --> 1028.52
and we shouldn't expect honesty because

1026.0 --> 1030.439
that's what they want to break

1028.52 --> 1031.339
they want to break the honesty they

1030.439 --> 1035.24
wanna

1031.339 --> 1038.8999999999999
break the moral nature

1035.24 --> 1041.839
to be equal right

1038.9 --> 1046.9
so that they can then project onto you

1041.839 --> 1046.8999999999999
what they dictate equality it really is

1047.72 --> 1053.84
it's their tactic they're being super

1050.78 --> 1056.4189999999999
hypocritical on purpose because their

1053.84 --> 1059.6599999999999
only morality they know is that you do

1056.419 --> 1062.0590000000002
everything they say and if you don't you

1059.66 --> 1063.3200000000002
are immoral you are the enemy and every

1062.059 --> 1065.96
measure

1063.32 --> 1069.5
is deserving that's their tactic that's

1065.96 --> 1074.02
the Communist tactic it is blatantly

1069.5 --> 1074.02
evil Beyond imagining really

1074.059 --> 1080.4189999999999
and to point it out is

1077.0 --> 1082.4
is kind of like yeah no [ __ ] Sherlock no

1080.419 --> 1083.9
[ __ ] Sherlock how many times does does

1082.4 --> 1085.5800000000002
he do you need to say that do you think

1083.9 --> 1087.2
that anybody in the world doesn't even

1085.58 --> 1089.24
see that

1087.2 --> 1091.7
like everybody in the world sees that

1089.24 --> 1093.38
like they have to see that like the only

1091.7 --> 1094.88
way not to see it is to jab your own

1093.38 --> 1096.8600000000001
eyes out

1094.88 --> 1100.1200000000001
and they'll still see it by the way so

1096.86 --> 1100.12
that that doesn't even work

1115.94 --> 1119.3600000000001
a low impression I don't know that

1117.98 --> 1122.38
terminology what what do you mean

1119.36 --> 1122.3799999999999
flatten the Curve

1123.26 --> 1128.98
I don't know what it is what the [ __ ] is

1125.539 --> 1128.98
low pressure never heard of it

1146.96 --> 1149.559
all right

1154.46 --> 1158.24
oh it's a word you make up okay great

1157.22 --> 1161.919
well

1158.24 --> 1161.919
that's pointless then

1175.1 --> 1179.5
I'm depressed am I depressed

1180.26 --> 1185.48
uh why are you saying I'm depressed

1182.419 --> 1188.72
because I'm not like irrationally

1185.48 --> 1191.6
courageous and and loud

1188.72 --> 1194.3600000000001
is that not being depressed

1191.6 --> 1197.299
what if it was exactly the opposite what

1194.36 --> 1200.1789999999999
if I'm actually raging and all that as

1197.299 --> 1201.9189999999999
an over conversation because I'm

1200.179 --> 1203.9
actually depressed and trying to stay

1201.919 --> 1207.2800000000002
out of it have you ever realized that

1203.9 --> 1207.2800000000002
that might be the case

1214.34 --> 1218.6589999999999
dude shut up can you stop talking

1216.799 --> 1219.9189999999999
flatten the curve you're spamming my

1218.659 --> 1222.5200000000002
chat and you're spamming it with

1219.919 --> 1222.5200000000002
[ __ ]

1226.46 --> 1232.419
don't care about your made-up word

1229.4 --> 1232.419
don't need it

1233.09 --> 1239.1399999999999
[Music]

1235.4 --> 1239.14
I'm talking about real things here

1252.799 --> 1258.1399999999999
all right is anybody else here

1255.02 --> 1260.24
besides flatten the curve that is

1258.14 --> 1264.76
because I don't want to just see him

1260.24 --> 1264.76
spamming my chat full it's very annoying

1278.299 --> 1283.78
okay yeah I'm fixing it all right you

1281.059 --> 1283.78
got a timeout

1319.76 --> 1325.84
all right Kevlar yeah thanks

1322.7 --> 1325.8400000000001
glowstone monkey

1344.78 --> 1349.94
the thing is I I want to get this under

1348.02 --> 1351.98
control and it's

1349.94 --> 1355.159
probably the biggest psychological

1351.98 --> 1358.039
challenge I've ever had

1355.159 --> 1361.159
right because you got to realize that

1358.039 --> 1364.6
tactically like 20 years ago I avoided

1361.159 --> 1364.6000000000001
avoided confrontation

1367.34 --> 1371.8999999999999
right

1368.44 --> 1373.64
to prevent my rage

1371.9 --> 1376.4
from entering

1373.64 --> 1380.0
and this is including during like

1376.4 --> 1384.26
the actual confrontation and extreme

1380.0 --> 1386.12
trauma related confrontations where I

1384.26 --> 1388.34
got to see things and learn things about

1386.12 --> 1391.4599999999998
the world that I literally cannot handle

1388.34 --> 1395.12
and that still fuels that very rage

1391.46 --> 1398.14
that I let loose in here sometimes

1395.12 --> 1398.1399999999999
and that's like

1398.659 --> 1404.2990000000002
30 25 years ago

1401.24 --> 1406.159
a long time ago and it's that was the

1404.299 --> 1408.02
thing that I suppressed and I've been TR

1406.159 --> 1410.179
like suppressing it for a long time

1408.02 --> 1411.98
because I was afraid my rage would come

1410.179 --> 1414.5590000000002
out

1411.98 --> 1418.76
I don't know how to deal with it you see

1414.559 --> 1422.24
but I can't extinguish it because if I

1418.76 --> 1424.82
do that I'm like absolutely terrified

1422.24 --> 1426.26
and absolutely terrified that if I do

1424.82 --> 1428.96
that

1426.26 --> 1431.6589999999999
that I might literally

1428.96 --> 1437.539
like lose everything that I might

1431.659 --> 1439.88
actually just be like okay okay world

1437.539 --> 1443.72
you're not gonna handle this then I will

1439.88 --> 1446.5390000000002
become the Ultimate Enemy of everything

1443.72 --> 1449.3600000000001
then I will become my enemy

1446.539 --> 1451.1589999999999
and I will be worse than my enemy and I

1449.36 --> 1454.34
will avenge

1451.159 --> 1458.6200000000001
all of your negligence all of it

1454.34 --> 1458.62
I don't want that I don't want it

1458.96 --> 1464.02
so I have to somehow deal with this

1466.039 --> 1469.84
with this sensory that I have

1477.559 --> 1480.94
because yeah

1482.72 --> 1489.8600000000001
I want my life I want a life

1486.74 --> 1491.779
and all these Sensations it's just in my

1489.86 --> 1494.0
way it's so in my way that I've

1491.779 --> 1496.1
tactically rearranged my entire life

1494.0 --> 1499.48
just to be able to deal with it

1496.1 --> 1499.48
and I want a life

1499.76 --> 1504.62
I just want the life back

1502.76 --> 1507.46
something that I feel like I've never

1504.62 --> 1507.4599999999998
really gotten it

1508.7 --> 1513.38
but then again would it even be fair to

1511.4 --> 1516.38
expect that I could have ever had in the

1513.38 --> 1519.919
Life in this [ __ ] world

1516.38 --> 1523.3400000000001
where avoiding realizing what it is

1519.919 --> 1526.0
would have been the only way to actually

1523.34 --> 1526.0
succeed

1527.84 --> 1535.299
which is what I was trying to do for

1531.559 --> 1535.299
25 years or so

1535.4 --> 1538.0
right

1559.82 --> 1564.82
low backs and hey Rick back good to see

1562.7 --> 1564.82
you

1588.14 --> 1591.8600000000001
doing my part I've

1590.84 --> 1595.779
okay

1591.86 --> 1595.779
okay man if you say so

1612.74 --> 1614.919
foreign

1648.399 --> 1652.4799999999998
passion or Panic or

1655.76 --> 1660.86
it's just

1657.5 --> 1663.14
I had been going on a certain route that

1660.86 --> 1666.02
I pointed out like I thought like let's

1663.14 --> 1670.72
build up let's actually overtake this

1666.02 --> 1670.72
it's not happening it's not happening

1672.559 --> 1677.84
I mean people are kind of making a move

1675.919 --> 1679.64
I guess

1677.84 --> 1681.559
I don't

1679.64 --> 1684.7990000000002
just

1681.559 --> 1687.76
I don't see it changing anything I I

1684.799 --> 1687.76
just don't see it

1689.72 --> 1695.72
it's like almost like just not enough

1692.48 --> 1698.24
people have lost everything

1695.72 --> 1701.26
or something like there's there's two

1698.24 --> 1701.26
still too much

1702.799 --> 1707.48
too much to be

1705.32 --> 1710.299
gotten out of this

1707.48 --> 1713.26
out of this monster that's actually

1710.299 --> 1713.26
doing all this

1713.36 --> 1719.539
people just can't can't stop they can't

1716.059 --> 1723.44
let it go they can't let go of the like

1719.539 --> 1725.72
the robber baron profit system they

1723.44 --> 1727.8200000000002
can't let it go like the world has

1725.72 --> 1730.22
become too Grim because of it and now

1727.82 --> 1732.7
they can't let it go they can't lessen

1730.22 --> 1732.7
themselves

1738.679 --> 1744.5
dude flatten the what the [ __ ] are you

1741.559 --> 1747.2
blabbering about and please don't

1744.5 --> 1749.659
explain that in another five [ __ ]

1747.2 --> 1752.74
sentences yeah you're spamming it's

1749.659 --> 1752.74
getting on my nerve

1764.299 --> 1767.299

1769.76 --> 1772.48
okay

1781.22 --> 1785.26

1786.559 --> 1790.36
hello Fisher from Eden

1795.799 --> 1798.94
what's that even mean

1801.919 --> 1808.159
how's it going this morning I guess

1805.1 --> 1810.799
good and not so good

1808.159 --> 1814.419
I'm kind of hungry and I'm dead broke I

1810.799 --> 1814.4189999999999
have been since yesterday

1821.24 --> 1825.559
I'm actually considering since my

1823.58 --> 1829.279
roommate happens to be at home I'm

1825.559 --> 1833.02
considering asking her to borrow money

1829.279 --> 1833.02
which is like a weird thing

1834.86 --> 1838.6589999999999
I think yeah

1836.0 --> 1838.659
yeah I don't know

1842.179 --> 1847.88
I could also try to

1844.7 --> 1849.44
like make dinner with her like she and

1847.88 --> 1851.6000000000001
me seemed to be the only one at home

1849.44 --> 1853.76
right now

1851.6 --> 1855.9189999999999
it's kind of an interesting potential

1853.76 --> 1858.52
opportunity I don't know if I should do

1855.919 --> 1858.5200000000002
anything though

1883.94 --> 1889.3990000000001
right gaining wisdom

1886.22 --> 1890.8990000000001
well I I never spend on anything that I

1889.399 --> 1892.82
feel like I don't know what's gonna

1890.899 --> 1895.039
happen with it just because of the

1892.82 --> 1897.5
short-term convenience like I don't

1895.039 --> 1899.419
spend money like that anymore

1897.5 --> 1904.159
like ever

1899.419 --> 1905.8400000000001
just randomly money to anything

1904.159 --> 1908.419
oh

1905.84 --> 1911.5
thank you the Fisher from Eden

1908.419 --> 1911.5
you didn't need to do that

1914.12 --> 1920.059
right and yeah just to remind everybody

1916.64 --> 1922.64
actual support is

1920.059 --> 1926.1399999999999
like that the way it actually helps me

1922.64 --> 1926.14
is if you do it through PayPal

1931.1 --> 1936.34
but thank you very much for your super

1932.779 --> 1936.34
chat I appreciate that

1962.899 --> 1966.5189999999998
hmm

1963.98 --> 1966.519
right

1966.559 --> 1971.24
yeah right back what do you mean exactly

1968.84 --> 1972.62
meaningless sentiments like raise your

1971.24 --> 1974.48
vibration

1972.62 --> 1975.86
all right

1974.48 --> 1977.539
they're not saying anything but you're

1975.86 --> 1978.74
thinking they're profound it's like oh

1977.539 --> 1980.779
just

1978.74 --> 1982.519
feel better man feel but that's

1980.779 --> 1985.399
basically what is raise your vibration

1982.519 --> 1986.6
just feel better

1985.399 --> 1989.4799999999998
right

1986.6 --> 1992.1789999999999
it's a weird way of saying that

1989.48 --> 1994.58
but on the other hand it can be like a

1992.179 --> 1998.419
good metaphor

1994.58 --> 2000.22
for like yeah everybody is just kind of

1998.419 --> 2001.779
depressed they don't think they can do

2000.22 --> 2003.159
anything they've bought into the

2001.779 --> 2005.519
Illusions and they don't think they can

2003.159 --> 2005.519
do anything

2006.46 --> 2011.919
so like stop that break out of it raise

2010.12 --> 2014.4599999999998
your vibration

2011.919 --> 2014.46
right

2015.64 --> 2020.74
are you telling me YouTube takes a cut

2017.98 --> 2022.419
yeah everything pretty much

2020.74 --> 2026.08
YouTube takes a cut out of the super

2022.419 --> 2028.779
chat then I get it then I report it to

2026.08 --> 2031.12
my government and then they pretty much

2028.779 --> 2033.22
take everything else

2031.12 --> 2035.4399999999998
I don't get anything out of super chats

2033.22 --> 2039.1000000000001
I only get anything out of PayPal

2035.44 --> 2041.7
donations and patreon subscribers

2039.1 --> 2041.6999999999998
really

2045.82 --> 2050.7999999999997
and I've been trying to inform my

2048.7 --> 2053.5
audience about that for like what is it

2050.8 --> 2055.599
now two three years

2053.5 --> 2057.399
it's been like that it's gonna stay like

2055.599 --> 2060.159
that I don't know what to change about

2057.399 --> 2062.679
it unless I suddenly start to have such

2060.159 --> 2064.96
massive amounts of support

2062.679 --> 2066.639
that it literally outdoes my entire

2064.96 --> 2069.099
social welfare and then it's not going

2066.639 --> 2071.32
to be an issue anymore

2069.099 --> 2073.98
but yeah that's not even remotely the

2071.32 --> 2073.98
case right now

2082.24 --> 2088.24
talk about it right right system no it's

2085.3 --> 2090.7000000000003
not rigged system it's that's just me

2088.24 --> 2094.2999999999997
and my

2090.7 --> 2096.52
financial situation in my country

2094.3 --> 2098.7400000000002
living off social welfare unfortunately

2096.52 --> 2101.88
trying to do this on the side but

2098.74 --> 2101.8799999999997
everything is expensive

2103.78 --> 2109.48
that's the situation it's socialism and

2106.48 --> 2111.82
it's socialism not even in the worst

2109.48 --> 2113.26
stage because it could all be a lot

2111.82 --> 2116.7400000000002
worse

2113.26 --> 2119.5600000000004
let's let's hope that never happens it's

2116.74 --> 2122.7999999999997
kind of stable but still for somebody in

2119.56 --> 2126.72
my position it's not super ideal but

2122.8 --> 2126.7200000000003
it's not the worst it could be either

2128.74 --> 2134.02
I mean I am sort of getting around

2131.02 --> 2136.68
thanks to the help from you guys and

2134.02 --> 2136.68
doing this

2151.06 --> 2154.48
no one should cast Estonian Vengeance

2153.339 --> 2157.06
right

2154.48 --> 2158.98
yes gaining wisdom well I don't want

2157.06 --> 2161.38
vengeance

2158.98 --> 2165.579
all right it sounds weird right in a way

2161.38 --> 2168.82
I've yeah my vigilanteism and like get

2165.579 --> 2173.92
him take him down kill him right now

2168.82 --> 2176.26
it's yes I I basically tricked myself

2173.92 --> 2178.54
because I am using Vengeance but it's

2176.26 --> 2181.0600000000004
not the reason the way the reason why I

2178.54 --> 2186.2799999999997
thought like do this we should do this

2181.06 --> 2188.56
is because I'm genuinely thinking like

2186.28 --> 2190.48
like I don't see any other way I didn't

2188.56 --> 2193.7999999999997
see any other way like it would

2190.48 --> 2193.8
successfully get out of it

2194.68 --> 2201.7
right but just Vengeance just like

2198.28 --> 2203.92
giving into that pure sensation that's

2201.7 --> 2206.9199999999996
that's utter Madness that's like

2203.92 --> 2209.079
literally giving up

2206.92 --> 2211.78
I will never recommend doing that never

2209.079 --> 2213.7000000000003
just Vengeance right I I really hate

2211.78 --> 2216.4
those freaks

2213.7 --> 2218.02
that just like go berserk and just kill

2216.4 --> 2221.64
a bunch of random people and maybe

2218.02 --> 2224.859
themselves like I hate that I despise

2221.64 --> 2227.44
like utterly despise those types of

2224.859 --> 2230.2599999999998
people that end up doing that I really

2227.44 --> 2234.18
really [ __ ] hate them because they're

2230.26 --> 2234.1800000000003
exactly the opposite of everything

2235.359 --> 2240.88
that I yeah that I want

2238.48 --> 2242.44
I want people to actually be able to

2240.88 --> 2246.46
harness

2242.44 --> 2247.54
that power and and then be effective

2246.46 --> 2251.64
with it

2247.54 --> 2251.64
not just freaking random people

2265.66 --> 2272.14
right but it's like it's pointless for

2269.68 --> 2274.2999999999997
me it's pointless

2272.14 --> 2277.359
it's nobody's response it's not gonna

2274.3 --> 2279.3390000000004
happen it's so highly discouraged it's

2277.359 --> 2282.4
oh well it's peaceful peaceful peaceful

2279.339 --> 2285.52
peaceful oh no no be peaceful just wait

2282.4 --> 2288.64
until they open fire and then you can

2285.52 --> 2290.44
complain about it afterward how you were

2288.64 --> 2292.72
peaceful and now you're getting all

2290.44 --> 2295.599
killed oh and then you can complain

2292.72 --> 2298.66
about it afterwards yeah oh poor also

2295.599 --> 2300.4
just got they don't give a [ __ ] they

2298.66 --> 2304.0
don't give a [ __ ]

2300.4 --> 2305.5
they'll do anything anything they can if

2304.0 --> 2307.06
they think they can get away with it and

2305.5 --> 2309.7
even if they don't think they can get

2307.06 --> 2311.74
away with it they'll still do it they'll

2309.7 --> 2314.5
still [ __ ] do it because they know if

2311.74 --> 2315.7599999999998
they just keep on upping that slide of

2314.5 --> 2318.16
Madness

2315.76 --> 2320.38
people will not be able to catch up with

2318.16 --> 2322.72
it they will not be able to catch up

2320.38 --> 2325.9
with that

2322.72 --> 2328.54
right that's why I'm like having

2325.9 --> 2330.52
allergic responses to everybody that

2328.54 --> 2334.66
just say oh we just peacefully

2330.52 --> 2335.56
demonstrated it'll be all right no no it

2334.66 --> 2337.5989999999997
won't

2335.56 --> 2340.119
it isn't

2337.599 --> 2342.3590000000004
but you're gonna have to find out for

2340.119 --> 2342.359
yourself

2347.8 --> 2353.98
they're [ __ ] insane communist Maniacs

2351.48 --> 2356.94
Beyond coming it's a pure devil

2353.98 --> 2362.16
possessed pieces of [ __ ] in power places

2356.94 --> 2366.339
and they intend to maximize the abuse

2362.16 --> 2370.0
the maximize the abuse they don't give a

2366.339 --> 2372.2799999999997
[ __ ] for any form of communication that

2370.0 --> 2375.82
interferes with everything that they

2372.28 --> 2380.099
want which is beyond what any normal

2375.82 --> 2380.099
human being should ever want ever

2380.26 --> 2384.6400000000003
they don't give a [ __ ] what you do like

2383.2 --> 2388.9199999999996
protest

2384.64 --> 2388.92
anything they don't give a [ __ ]

2393.22 --> 2397.7799999999997
ugh

2395.98 --> 2400.2
but there's nothing I can really do

2397.78 --> 2400.2000000000003
about it

2400.54 --> 2405.9
just Cassandra complex still gonna

2402.7 --> 2405.8999999999996
happen it's all gonna happen

2409.06 --> 2413.98
and I bet that

2411.339 --> 2417.5789999999997
at some point things are might actually

2413.98 --> 2420.28
turn like really vengeful

2417.579 --> 2423.4
and it's like oh yeah okay well maybe if

2420.28 --> 2425.5
half of everybody that's good intent if

2423.4 --> 2429.7000000000003
they're just blatantly murdered and

2425.5 --> 2433.599
tortured in plain sight and they all die

2429.7 --> 2436.2999999999997
maybe then well maybe then it's time to

2433.599 --> 2438.6400000000003
actually just start killing oh oh yeah

2436.3 --> 2442.599
well I guess that half of every good

2438.64 --> 2447.16
person ever just needs to be killed men

2442.599 --> 2449.8
before you do anything right right and

2447.16 --> 2452.46
then and then when it happens yeah when

2449.8 --> 2455.2000000000003
it happens then later in the future

2452.46 --> 2457.7200000000003
after all that [ __ ] damage is done in

2455.2 --> 2459.16
society is irreparably damaged because

2457.72 --> 2461.98
there's not enough good people to even

2459.16 --> 2464.3799999999997
uphold it anymore then you can be pissed

2461.98 --> 2466.66
off at little old Arwin

2464.38 --> 2468.7000000000003
yeah and then you can be pissed off at

2466.66 --> 2470.7999999999997
me

2468.7 --> 2473.68
right because I was the one that

2470.8 --> 2475.96
actually told you to do it before all

2473.68 --> 2477.7599999999998
the good people got killed

2475.96 --> 2481.619
yeah

2477.76 --> 2481.619
then you can be pissed off at me

2487.54 --> 2493.66
hey thank you flatten the curse

2491.2 --> 2496.2999999999997
for the Super Chat donation

2493.66 --> 2501.04
I'd appreciate it if you send paypals

2496.3 --> 2504.9
though since then I actually get get it

2501.04 --> 2504.9
I just explained that earlier

2533.859 --> 2538.9
it seems so hopeless what can we do

2536.68 --> 2542.0789999999997
nothing

2538.9 --> 2544.119
sit through the torture and be defiant

2542.079 --> 2546.3390000000004
literally ignore

2544.119 --> 2547.9
their mind control program so if they

2546.339 --> 2550.96
say oh you have to be facts though you

2547.9 --> 2553.0
have to mask the work just literally

2550.96 --> 2555.4
ignore it

2553.0 --> 2557.44
and get ready for a fist fight

2555.4 --> 2561.96
because there will be [ __ ] up Karen's

2557.44 --> 2561.96
and all that [ __ ] just like

2562.78 --> 2568.5400000000004
be like militantly passively resistant

2566.38 --> 2570.04
and I guess that in in ways there is

2568.54 --> 2572.44
plenty of people that already do yeah

2570.04 --> 2574.7799999999997
this works great you see that's why

2572.44 --> 2576.099
that's the only solution really on the

2574.78 --> 2578.619
short term

2576.099 --> 2580.3590000000004
is because it is working

2578.619 --> 2582.88
there are people out there that are

2580.359 --> 2585.0989999999997
having their jobs in companies big

2582.88 --> 2587.1400000000003
companies corporations that tell them

2585.099 --> 2589.06
you have to do this or you're fired they

2587.14 --> 2591.22
don't do it and then they're not fired

2589.06 --> 2594.7599999999998
and they still keep working

2591.22 --> 2596.6189999999997
While others all complain

2594.76 --> 2600.3
right

2596.619 --> 2600.3
literally ignore it

2602.74 --> 2608.56
like don't even complain about it just

2605.92 --> 2609.64
ignore it just don't wear it don't take

2608.56 --> 2613.48
it

2609.64 --> 2617.0989999999997
[ __ ] this QR Scanner whatever just say

2613.48 --> 2617.099
[ __ ] you I'm not part of that

2634.06 --> 2638.44
yeah yeah that's that's cute flatten the

2636.819 --> 2641.2799999999997
curve thanks for the super I'm still

2638.44 --> 2641.28
gonna time you out

2645.099 --> 2647.2200000000003
thank you

2655.5 --> 2662.38
mine and it will see no not really

2659.02 --> 2666.3
fishermen if he didn't know

2662.38 --> 2666.3
so how are you gonna get to that point

2667.24 --> 2672.339
I mean there seems to be sort of like

2670.119 --> 2676.319
preliminary signs that something might

2672.339 --> 2676.319
be happening right and that's also like

2676.78 --> 2684.94
I basically gotta let go my vengeance

2682.359 --> 2688.7799999999997
angle

2684.94 --> 2691.319
and just see you're really gonna do this

2688.78 --> 2693.3390000000004
are you actually gonna do this because

2691.319 --> 2695.98
it might

2693.339 --> 2698.02
maybe it's finally over maybe it

2695.98 --> 2699.94
actually is this is finally the

2698.02 --> 2701.2599999999998
beginning of the end

2699.94 --> 2702.64
for it

2701.26 --> 2705.28
but

2702.64 --> 2708.339
I'm just so skeptical at this point I've

2705.28 --> 2710.579
sit sat through this [ __ ] my half my

2708.339 --> 2710.5789999999997
life

2712.359 --> 2716.38
I'm like

2714.099 --> 2718.2400000000002
I feel like a soldier that's in a war

2716.38 --> 2720.099
and it's just like it's already I've

2718.24 --> 2722.5
already accepted like this war is

2720.099 --> 2724.599
literally never going to end ever so

2722.5 --> 2727.18
that if it would end I would literally

2724.599 --> 2729.1600000000003
not even realize it

2727.18 --> 2731.2
I'd be like one of the Japanese soldier

2729.16 --> 2732.94
on an island somewhere just still like

2731.2 --> 2734.319
yeah we're holding the forward we're

2732.94 --> 2738.78
holding the 40 even though the war has

2734.319 --> 2738.7799999999997
been over for like five or ten years

2747.88 --> 2753.2200000000003
it's like I'm so skeptical

2750.579 --> 2755.76
about all of this like they have to see

2753.22 --> 2755.7599999999998
them dead

2755.8 --> 2761.079
I have to see them dead before I am

2758.859 --> 2764.2
willing to stop this

2761.079 --> 2766.9
but maybe I do have to stop this right

2764.2 --> 2770.02
now for the moment and see

2766.9 --> 2771.4
the resistance if it even is a

2770.02 --> 2773.38
resistance because that's the question

2771.4 --> 2774.94
isn't it are they actually a resistance

2773.38 --> 2779.1600000000003
or are they just the new player gonna

2774.94 --> 2779.16
take over and do the same thing to us

2779.98 --> 2785.319
I'm gonna have to let it go and see what

2783.22 --> 2788.2
they do if they're actually going to end

2785.319 --> 2790.38
it or if it's just the next layer moving

2788.2 --> 2790.3799999999997
in

2793.96 --> 2799.42
yeah yeah at least G yeah dude

2796.839 --> 2801.339
yeah you heard that first part right I

2799.42 --> 2803.44
was literally just foaming at the mouth

2801.339 --> 2807.2999999999997
screaming almost

2803.44 --> 2807.3
I was so [ __ ] pissed off

2807.46 --> 2814.119
in and this is basically the extension

2811.06 --> 2816.599
of that in a more calm sense because

2814.119 --> 2816.599
yeah

2816.7 --> 2822.7599999999998
and Hey I was talking to Americans so I

2819.4 --> 2824.98
I really I amped it up to try to

2822.76 --> 2826.1800000000003
actually get through and the funny thing

2824.98 --> 2827.859
was

2826.18 --> 2829.66
some of the guys they're actually

2827.859 --> 2833.44
recognized

2829.66 --> 2835.72
my my logical train of thinking that was

2833.44 --> 2839.819
behind it they actually realized like

2835.72 --> 2839.819
yeah you kind of have a point

2840.819 --> 2844.98
and that's that's one thing at least

2856.54 --> 2860.88
God asked him to intervene well

2861.16 --> 2866.64
I don't see why I would need to ask God

2863.98 --> 2866.64
to do that

2868.119 --> 2872.819
I mean why do I need to ask that

2874.72 --> 2877.5589999999997
I mean

2879.4 --> 2886.3
I don't see the point like yeah

2884.44 --> 2890.46
either he's gonna do it or he isn't

2886.3 --> 2890.46
through people as he always does

2891.46 --> 2896.38
right and I'm now kind of like already

2893.8 --> 2899.2000000000003
say like maybe this is it maybe it's

2896.38 --> 2901.599
finally gonna stop now

2899.2 --> 2903.46
I still have a glimmer of hope but I'm

2901.599 --> 2906.4
just like I'm

2903.46 --> 2907.9
I'm already pissed off I'm already

2906.4 --> 2910.1800000000003
pissed off

2907.9 --> 2911.98
and a view where I'm seeing that it

2910.18 --> 2914.44
turned out not to be the case anyway

2911.98 --> 2916.839
like I'm already pissed off right now

2914.44 --> 2918.46
about that it's not gonna turn out to be

2916.839 --> 2920.7599999999998
real

2918.46 --> 2920.76
right

2927.04 --> 2931.54
I've just become that skeptical and like

2929.079 --> 2934.059
I'm not buying it anymore I'm not buying

2931.54 --> 2936.2799999999997
any stores anymore my I just have a

2934.059 --> 2938.2000000000003
final solution and it's just one final

2936.28 --> 2941.2000000000003
solution it's just one

2938.2 --> 2945.339
it's completely irrational

2941.2 --> 2948.0989999999997
in the face of how Society works

2945.339 --> 2950.74
because people weren't going to do that

2948.099 --> 2954.059
none of them want to do that none of

2950.74 --> 2954.0589999999997
them are gonna do it

2955.24 --> 2960.9399999999996
until half of everybody dies like and

2958.54 --> 2963.7
like until everybody knows a person

2960.94 --> 2965.7400000000002
that's literally been just

2963.7 --> 2969.0
like

2965.74 --> 2973.0
killed or super heavily mishandled

2969.0 --> 2975.22
mutilated by freaking communist police

2973.0 --> 2977.079
or military or something right

2975.22 --> 2980.74
like that's what it's gonna take they're

2977.079 --> 2983.619
gonna have to see their direct close by

2980.74 --> 2985.9199999999996
loved ones tortured before they're

2983.619 --> 2989.319
[ __ ] gonna do something about it

2985.92 --> 2992.38
Beyond just being part of the system and

2989.319 --> 2994.359
trying to resist from within right there

2992.38 --> 2996.819
is no more system

2994.359 --> 3000.119
that that is yours that it isn't there

2996.819 --> 3002.16
anymore you're just hanging on to this

3000.119 --> 3003.6600000000003
corrupted bloated thing that's taking

3002.16 --> 3006.0
over the world

3003.66 --> 3008.7
it's not there and it's not what it used

3006.0 --> 3011.099
to be it's not gonna be what it used to

3008.7 --> 3012.72
be anymore I don't believe that I just

3011.099 --> 3016.5
don't believe it anymore

3012.72 --> 3018.839
I mean the structures the foundational

3016.5 --> 3023.64
structures will be there

3018.839 --> 3029.42
but what now is sitting in in control

3023.64 --> 3029.42
they are never going to uncorrupt never

3033.0 --> 3039.66
the only way to finish yeah is to

3036.9 --> 3042.059
surgically remove them

3039.66 --> 3045.0589999999997
do it all in one go right if you're

3042.059 --> 3046.98
gonna go into like a if you're going to

3045.059 --> 3050.099
decide to go into some kind of a cancer

3046.98 --> 3051.9
surgery then you better then we'll hope

3050.099 --> 3055.8590000000004
the surgeon is going to remove every

3051.9 --> 3058.319
part immediately right because if you

3055.859 --> 3062.0589999999997
leave anything behind

3058.319 --> 3062.0589999999997
it's gonna get even more aggressive

3066.359 --> 3070.88
perhaps you should just [ __ ] off

3092.28 --> 3097.619
right well that's what I believe too God

3094.619 --> 3099.78
never God doesn't actually give anyone

3097.619 --> 3102.6600000000003
any power unless they are willing to

3099.78 --> 3107.119
literally die for it

3102.66 --> 3107.1189999999997
like literally die and that means

3107.599 --> 3113.2200000000003
absolute takeover that means everybody

3111.24 --> 3116.339
collect your guns

3113.22 --> 3121.22
go in expect half of you to get shot

3116.339 --> 3121.22
killed blown up and then kill them all

3122.7 --> 3129.5989999999997
and then God might actually just get

3125.94 --> 3130.559
regain some interest back in your bunch

3129.599 --> 3134.6400000000003
of

3130.559 --> 3138.02
devil [ __ ] [ __ ]

3134.64 --> 3141.0589999999997
because that's what it is

3138.02 --> 3142.98
inaction letting it happen you have a

3141.059 --> 3146.579
freaking Constitution that tells you

3142.98 --> 3148.68
this is your duty it's your duty to do

3146.579 --> 3150.7200000000003
this it's freaking over 200 years old

3148.68 --> 3154.3799999999997
it's your duty it's the second rule it's

3150.72 --> 3157.7
your duty and nobody is doing anything

3154.38 --> 3157.7000000000003
it's pathetic

3168.18 --> 3173.3999999999996
I mean like seriously if the founding

3170.7 --> 3175.9199999999996
fathers if that's real and if they

3173.4 --> 3176.94
really were what they are displayed as

3175.92 --> 3179.88
to be

3176.94 --> 3182.339
they wouldn't just be spinning in their

3179.88 --> 3184.079
graves if they saw what was currently in

3182.339 --> 3188.96
government control no they would

3184.079 --> 3188.96
literally explode out of Shame

3189.54 --> 3197.18
they would shift out of reality it's so

3193.68 --> 3200.2799999999997
unbelievably insane but people over the

3197.18 --> 3203.24
centuries have just allowed

3200.28 --> 3203.2400000000002
to grow here

3218.76 --> 3222.78
foreign

3220.619 --> 3225.359
at least we still have each other yeah

3222.78 --> 3226.2000000000003
right so and then at some point you

3225.359 --> 3228.96
won't

3226.2 --> 3232.2599999999998
at some point each other those other

3228.96 --> 3234.54
people you love they will be killed too

3232.26 --> 3237.48
are you going to do something then

3234.54 --> 3240.0589999999997
because I guarantee it to you I

3237.48 --> 3243.599
guaranteed oh we have each other yeah

3240.059 --> 3246.6600000000003
they will kill each other you

3243.599 --> 3250.02
or maybe their own they will do it

3246.66 --> 3252.66
so what's it gonna take until you're all

3250.02 --> 3255.359
so sick of it you're just gonna do the

3252.66 --> 3262.22
only thing left to do

3255.359 --> 3262.22
is violent revolution and Kill Them All

3263.46 --> 3269.059
how long is it gonna take now I'm gone

3265.44 --> 3269.059
here again I don't want to go here

3287.21 --> 3290.309
[Music]

3309.54 --> 3314.7599999999998
won't the people lose everything the

3312.54 --> 3316.619
people will begin to yeah but that

3314.76 --> 3318.42
what's the point of that you lost

3316.619 --> 3321.1800000000003
everything

3318.42 --> 3323.48
oh you you start to fight when you lost

3321.18 --> 3323.48
everything

3323.64 --> 3327.299
what are you gonna fight with you lost

3325.44 --> 3330.599
everything what you're gonna throw

3327.299 --> 3332.94
stones at them now right oh Oh you mean

3330.599 --> 3335.76
to say you're gonna do it before they

3332.94 --> 3337.38
actually start confiscating guns like

3335.76 --> 3339.2990000000004
sporadically in secret not even

3337.38 --> 3341.76
admitting it

3339.299 --> 3344.4
right that's oh

3341.76 --> 3346.26
so after they lost everything

3344.4 --> 3347.94
what are you gonna do it with what are

3346.26 --> 3349.98
you gonna do that with you lost

3347.94 --> 3352.579
everything

3349.98 --> 3352.579
right

3355.2 --> 3359.64
and besides like oh I'm gonna do

3357.54 --> 3362.099
something now because everybody I've

3359.64 --> 3364.68
ever known is now dead because of them

3362.099 --> 3367.02
oh really so when you finish them off

3364.68 --> 3370.5
why do you gotta rebuild the world with

3367.02 --> 3373.94
everybody you knew and you relied on and

3370.5 --> 3373.94
you worked with They're All Dead

3375.599 --> 3379.44
right it's pointless

3377.76 --> 3381.2400000000002
it's pointless then at that point

3379.44 --> 3383.4
they've already won because they've

3381.24 --> 3386.22
already killed everybody

3383.4 --> 3389.76
made them so poor that how are you gonna

3386.22 --> 3394.319
overthrow them then it's too late it's

3389.76 --> 3396.3590000000004
too late you set you watched

3394.319 --> 3399.7799999999997
you watched the world burn around you

3396.359 --> 3401.5789999999997
and you did nothing you waited

3399.78 --> 3403.6800000000003
until it's too late oh and then you're

3401.579 --> 3405.54
gonna do something well guess what I

3403.68 --> 3406.799
guarantee it's not gonna succeed after

3405.54 --> 3409.2
that point

3406.799 --> 3411.24
you're just gonna get yourself killed

3409.2 --> 3413.4199999999996
nobody will even realize what you've

3411.24 --> 3413.4199999999996
done

3425.099 --> 3427.6400000000003
right

3430.74 --> 3434.3999999999996
I mean just think about Lord of the

3433.26 --> 3438.38
Rings

3434.4 --> 3438.38
is that was that a great strategy

3438.839 --> 3444.54
just let them build up just let them

3441.96 --> 3449.359
build up until they're so strong we will

3444.54 --> 3449.359
be overwhelmed is that a good strategy

3456.54 --> 3461.099
I mean just imagine that Frodo or

3458.88 --> 3463.339
whatever actually did get caught then

3461.099 --> 3467.099
they were just it would have all been

3463.339 --> 3469.2599999999998
completely pointless then all of it they

3467.099 --> 3471.3590000000004
would have literally just all died

3469.26 --> 3473.579
right

3471.359 --> 3475.38
do we know any Frodo

3473.579 --> 3477.48
that's having the ring of power that's

3475.38 --> 3480.059
bringing it to Mount Doom right now do

3477.48 --> 3483.079
we know anybody do we

3480.059 --> 3483.079
I don't think so

3494.579 --> 3498.599
there's always a way I think you watch

3496.68 --> 3501.9199999999996
too much TV

3498.599 --> 3501.92
Fisher from Eden

3511.68 --> 3514.22
right

3515.299 --> 3519.2
hey Adam Price

3520.619 --> 3527.059
yeah I'm still hurting

3523.859 --> 3527.0589999999997
not a good feeling

3539.819 --> 3544.799
okay hey clutch

3541.76 --> 3546.599
right so yeah clutch another proposition

3544.799 --> 3549.72
all right all the Jabs yeah they will

3546.599 --> 3551.94
die yeah they will every one of them

3549.72 --> 3554.16
you have biological warfare in you

3551.94 --> 3556.079
you're not gonna survive that it's

3554.16 --> 3558.299
guaranteed they're all gonna die

3556.079 --> 3560.52
unless they have just pure saline shots

3558.299 --> 3562.68
but pretty much

3560.52 --> 3565.38
everything that everyone that hasn't

3562.68 --> 3566.5789999999997
they're all gonna die prematurely from

3565.38 --> 3569.7000000000003
it right

3566.579 --> 3571.799
and then what oh we solved the problem

3569.7 --> 3573.48
the people that couldn't handle reality

3571.799 --> 3575.819
are now all dead

3573.48 --> 3580.38
so how is that going to

3575.819 --> 3582.48
get us back our power

3580.38 --> 3585.38
no they're just it's just gonna make

3582.48 --> 3585.38
Society fall

3599.64 --> 3601.7599999999998
thank you

3649.98 --> 3652.64
right

3654.24 --> 3658.5
gonna take a two minute break I'll be

3656.099 --> 3661.5
back we'll be right back

3658.5 --> 3661.5
foreign

3735.539 --> 3738.539
foreign

3756.68 --> 3764.4199999999996
that seems like a hope based on the long

3760.98 --> 3764.42
long shot there

3765.059 --> 3767.6600000000003
right

3768.839 --> 3772.22
it's one of those tropes

3779.46 --> 3783.9
I mean as far as I've learned and I

3781.68 --> 3787.3799999999997
don't know how correct that is like the

3783.9 --> 3790.819
US military is being forced to be vax

3787.38 --> 3790.819
so how are they gonna do that

3793.98 --> 3801.359
at this point America is rigged to be

3797.0 --> 3803.7
utterly destroyed utterly

3801.359 --> 3805.98
I think it's gonna go to the point where

3803.7 --> 3808.2599999999998
they're literally gonna just keep on

3805.98 --> 3812.339
prodding Russia and all that

3808.26 --> 3815.099
until they actually just like Snap

3812.339 --> 3816.72
launch the missiles

3815.099 --> 3818.28
whether they're nukes or not doesn't

3816.72 --> 3820.14
really matter it's going to be

3818.28 --> 3821.88
devastating

3820.14 --> 3826.16
and then

3821.88 --> 3828.78
I swear it I swear they're gonna ensure

3826.16 --> 3833.0989999999997
that all the defense systems will be

3828.78 --> 3836.28
sabotaged to literally create a giant

3833.099 --> 3839.88
plate of craters make the United States

3836.28 --> 3843.1800000000003
into a giant plate of craters

3839.88 --> 3845.88
they will make the opponent launch

3843.18 --> 3848.0389999999998
everything and then they will stand down

3845.88 --> 3850.859
all the fences so that America is

3848.039 --> 3853.619
utterly destroyed like beyond anything

3850.859 --> 3857.359
you've ever imagined

3853.619 --> 3857.359
that's my prognosis

3857.46 --> 3861.7400000000002
maybe a bit over the top but I think

3859.92 --> 3865.52
they're actually gonna do that because

3861.74 --> 3865.52
what's stopping them

3877.74 --> 3880.16
foreign

3888.54 --> 3891.71
[Music]

3898.339 --> 3904.319
a link does not have a strong dude talk

3902.22 --> 3907.0789999999997
about you from it it's not as not a

3904.319 --> 3910.44
strong leader he's lit yeah

3907.079 --> 3913.92
against Americans no he's he's dedicated

3910.44 --> 3916.5
to destroying America like utterly

3913.92 --> 3919.099
obliterating it destroying its power

3916.5 --> 3919.099
forever

3922.319 --> 3928.0389999999998
and I don't think that he's gonna stop

3924.48 --> 3930.66
even if that means that like the entire

3928.039 --> 3932.46
nature and landscape and all the

3930.66 --> 3936.2
resource is going to be utterly

3932.46 --> 3936.2
destroyed I don't think he's gonna stop

3945.599 --> 3952.98
what causes the shadow on the moon

3949.38 --> 3954.9
what shadow you say the shadow can you

3952.98 --> 3956.819
prove that's a shadow or you mean

3954.9 --> 3959.46
darkened

3956.819 --> 3961.92
apparent Shadow if you think of the Moon

3959.46 --> 3963.96
as an object yeah you could call that a

3961.92 --> 3965.4
shadow it's not a shadow though because

3963.96 --> 3967.38
there's no proof that's a physical

3965.4 --> 3970.2200000000003
object yeah let's move on to something

3967.38 --> 3970.2200000000003
flat earthy

3970.26 --> 3973.8190000000004
oh this Doom [ __ ]

3974.94 --> 3977.9
ugh

3981.79 --> 3984.929
[Music]

3996.74 --> 4002.2
so what causes that I don't know I don't

3999.539 --> 4005.0
even know like how the celestial

4002.2 --> 4008.1189999999997
holographics how that can be the way it

4005.0 --> 4010.579
is I don't even know that let alone some

4008.119 --> 4012.859
detail about one of the holographic

4010.579 --> 4014.9
images I don't know that

4012.859 --> 4017.42
this is

4014.9 --> 4021.2000000000003
it's like just like asking like why does

4017.42 --> 4025.76
this sun thing that we see that hologram

4021.2 --> 4028.2799999999997
why does it have like sun spots

4025.76 --> 4030.6800000000003
when you look at it with the filter like

4028.28 --> 4033.039
I don't know I don't even know how it's

4030.68 --> 4033.0389999999998
there

4043.46 --> 4048.2
a black suit projector yeah but that's

4045.68 --> 4050.6189999999997
all just model nonsense though Marantz

4048.2 --> 4050.6189999999997
men's

4053.24 --> 4057.02
that's their little weird

4055.46 --> 4059.66
conception

4057.02 --> 4062.24
but it's it's all that none of that is

4059.66 --> 4065.48
literal you understand the Freemason

4062.24 --> 4068.5389999999998
model none of it is actually literal if

4065.48 --> 4071.92
you believe that's literal you're insane

4068.539 --> 4071.92
none of that is literal

4081.619 --> 4086.92
yeah I know you're Dutch the name gives

4084.559 --> 4086.92
it away

4088.9 --> 4096.52
only the Dutch used the a

4091.94 --> 4096.52
the longer a only they use that

4103.179 --> 4110.799
Freemasons suck big time

4106.339 --> 4110.799
well that's what they often end up doing

4117.859 --> 4122.54
their keeper of knowledge and then

4119.719 --> 4125.4800000000005
they're like yeah just

4122.54 --> 4127.88
be part of the plan

4125.48 --> 4130.339
and the plan is a lot of the time to

4127.88 --> 4132.679
confuse the [ __ ] out of people but in a

4130.339 --> 4135.38
specific way it's like

4132.679 --> 4139.759
they're so in confusion

4135.38 --> 4144.64
in specific ways that can be utilized

4139.759 --> 4144.64
and profited from right so they're like

4144.859 --> 4151.0
tested

4146.42 --> 4151.0
spell Weavers in general Society

4151.159 --> 4154.8189999999995
that's what I think the Freemasons

4152.9 --> 4158.9
really are there for

4154.819 --> 4163.42
to create Illusions to manipulate and

4158.9 --> 4163.42
steer people for profit and control

4169.1 --> 4174.859
and that includes confusing them

4172.699 --> 4176.9
about certain things that is like oh

4174.859 --> 4178.339
this is a subject oh yeah you shouldn't

4176.9 --> 4180.379999999999
be looking into this but if you're going

4178.339 --> 4183.739
to be looking at oh look at this look at

4180.38 --> 4186.5
this crazy [ __ ] yeah read that go look

4183.739 --> 4189.678999999999
into that and yeah you'll get completely

4186.5 --> 4192.319
schizo out of it right they have that

4189.679 --> 4194.659
[ __ ] they have things that they make you

4192.319 --> 4198.92
they want you to look into because

4194.659 --> 4201.759999999999
they've tested that to make people crazy

4198.92 --> 4201.76
you see

4202.58 --> 4207.98
it's a trap it's a spiritual trap it's

4205.52 --> 4210.92
designed to be a trap these they make

4207.98 --> 4212.839999999999
things that are designed to be traps for

4210.92 --> 4214.76
the spirit and if you actually dig into

4212.84 --> 4216.9800000000005
it and you attach

4214.76 --> 4219.14
you're [ __ ]

4216.98 --> 4222.82
because it curses you if you actually

4219.14 --> 4222.820000000001
believe you if you believe it

4246.34 --> 4251.360000000001
don't no no no no

4249.32 --> 4253.34
now you're just getting used to

4251.36 --> 4255.199
everybody being a [ __ ] [ __ ] around

4253.34 --> 4258.14
you man

4255.199 --> 4259.82
no me humans definitely made it up but

4258.14 --> 4261.860000000001
you got to realize that these humans

4259.82 --> 4265.46
that we have around us right now in the

4261.86 --> 4268.639999999999
world they're all like

4265.46 --> 4272.4800000000005
fourth fifth sixth generation of

4268.64 --> 4275.719
severely mentally deranged

4272.48 --> 4278.659
like they're all mentally spiritually

4275.719 --> 4280.76
mutilated people over generation upon

4278.659 --> 4283.339999999999
generation upon generation

4280.76 --> 4285.8
so yeah you lose your faculties that way

4283.34 --> 4287.96
so everybody now is a [ __ ] [ __ ]

4285.8 --> 4289.9400000000005
they can barely tie their own shoelaces

4287.96 --> 4292.58
and it's getting worse

4289.94 --> 4294.678999999999
it's being Excel oh it's okay to be a

4292.58 --> 4298.76
[ __ ] insane [ __ ] or whatever it's

4294.679 --> 4300.26
okay to be super super gross yeah that's

4298.76 --> 4302.54
making everybody stupid because

4300.26 --> 4304.76
stupidity becomes a survival mechanism

4302.54 --> 4306.62
because then your senses your

4304.76 --> 4309.02
sensibility isn't going to be burned out

4306.62 --> 4311.0599999999995
you're going to not burn yourself up in

4309.02 --> 4314.120000000001
rage over the realization of what's

4311.06 --> 4316.820000000001
really going on like me

4314.12 --> 4319.659
right so that's why everybody becomes

4316.82 --> 4321.98
stupid just like gay it's a choice

4319.659 --> 4324.5599999999995
unfortunately though if you hang on to

4321.98 --> 4326.54
that choice for too long you can't step

4324.56 --> 4328.88
out of it anymore you're then just

4326.54 --> 4330.199
stupid you'd haven't developed the

4328.88 --> 4334.42
faculties

4330.199 --> 4334.419999999999
so you're not gonna undo stupidity

4334.58 --> 4342.26
right but it's grown

4338.96 --> 4345.08
if all of this crap it's all taken away

4342.26 --> 4347.2390000000005
all of it normal if like literally

4345.08 --> 4349.88
people that are completely outside of

4347.239 --> 4351.44
society have no phones nothing they go

4349.88 --> 4352.6990000000005
into the woods like literally in the

4351.44 --> 4354.44
middle of nowhere and they make all

4352.699 --> 4356.48
their own food they make all their own

4354.44 --> 4360.5199999999995
supplies they buried a family that's

4356.48 --> 4362.48
become like a a micro communist Society

4360.52 --> 4365.900000000001
like micro

4362.48 --> 4369.678999999999
right A Tribe those people become

4365.9 --> 4373.04
freaking smart man like really sharp

4369.679 --> 4377.3
like super spiritual Razor Edge sharp

4373.04 --> 4379.82
right it's because everybody here in the

4377.3 --> 4381.56
cities and they've been bred to be

4379.82 --> 4383.719
[ __ ] [ __ ]

4381.56 --> 4387.14
they're conditioned school to be

4383.719 --> 4389.719
[ __ ] they learn if you're [ __ ]

4387.14 --> 4390.92
then it won't hurt you because you don't

4389.719 --> 4392.96
understand

4390.92 --> 4395.12
you shouldn't understand because it

4392.96 --> 4398.36
damages you the understanding is bad

4395.12 --> 4399.679
makes you panic yeah that's the

4398.36 --> 4401.42
conditioning

4399.679 --> 4402.86
that's the condition that's what makes

4401.42 --> 4405.86
everybody stupid

4402.86 --> 4408.86
but all these things all these creepy

4405.86 --> 4412.239
spell things they were all designed by

4408.86 --> 4412.239
humans all of it

4412.4 --> 4419.42
right however you could say

4416.179 --> 4421.04
whatever drove them the motivation

4419.42 --> 4423.4400000000005
behind it

4421.04 --> 4426.679
that might have been not human that

4423.44 --> 4429.379999999999
might have been just demonic right but a

4426.679 --> 4432.62
demon can only use the faculties

4429.38 --> 4434.84
available to them through a person

4432.62 --> 4437.599999999999
it's the person that effectively makes

4434.84 --> 4439.82
it being tricked by the demon that

4437.6 --> 4441.1990000000005
possesses them

4439.82 --> 4443.36
right

4441.199 --> 4446.0599999999995
humans make everything

4443.36 --> 4449.9
we design everything the demons don't

4446.06 --> 4453.38
design it they just motivate

4449.9 --> 4455.12
right they delude people into doing it

4453.38 --> 4457.82
they trick them

4455.12 --> 4460.5199999999995
demons themselves don't make anything

4457.82 --> 4463.4
they can't design anything they can't

4460.52 --> 4467.2390000000005
even think up anything

4463.4 --> 4470.42
they just push the motivation they

4467.239 --> 4473.0599999999995
obscure insights

4470.42 --> 4475.4800000000005
from people to trick them that's how

4473.06 --> 4475.4800000000005
they do it

4497.36 --> 4500.799999999999
[ __ ] they want to man

4536.12 --> 4543.64
right quit watching this yeah I don't

4538.699 --> 4543.639999999999
watch the news but I get Snippets of it

4544.52 --> 4549.820000000001
I don't literally watch it though

4547.28 --> 4549.82
God

4550.76 --> 4554.780000000001
I mean I only have so much stomach on

4553.52 --> 4557.659000000001
death you know

4554.78 --> 4559.9
I can't watch it that literally makes me

4557.659 --> 4559.9
sick

4560.84 --> 4565.400000000001
and I cannot believe that there are

4562.699 --> 4566.719
people actually being bound to that I

4565.4 --> 4571.42
can't believe there are people actually

4566.719 --> 4571.42
like watching that CNN like

4571.94 --> 4577.719
makes me sick just thinking about it if

4574.46 --> 4577.719
people are just watching that

4580.88 --> 4583.88
foreign

4591.64 --> 4596.42
the curve nobody cares about your stupid

4594.26 --> 4598.400000000001
invented word that's unnecessary and

4596.42 --> 4601.659
Superfluous nobody cares about low

4598.4 --> 4601.659
pressure it's stupid

4610.88 --> 4615.34
not news yeah it's barely news

4624.739 --> 4627.339999999999
foreign

4663.32 --> 4668.9
yeah dude Moraine I couldn't watch Joe

4666.26 --> 4671.780000000001
Rogan either I mean I reference him

4668.9 --> 4674.0
through Rogan's it up

4671.78 --> 4675.98
but

4674.0 --> 4677.84
because there's just there was always

4675.98 --> 4679.759999999999
this weird feeling like he was gonna

4677.84 --> 4683.14
turn around I don't think he isn't gonna

4679.76 --> 4683.14
turn around anymore though

4684.679 --> 4690.9800000000005
he's just a really [ __ ] up reversed

4688.94 --> 4693.799999999999
World Satanist

4690.98 --> 4696.86
he's just really [ __ ] up

4693.8 --> 4699.08
he's not gonna stop

4696.86 --> 4701.12
he literally reverses everything he

4699.08 --> 4704.0599999999995
basically joins the enemy

4701.12 --> 4706.76
with every argument and then says no I

4704.06 --> 4710.06
am on your side he's [ __ ] insane

4706.76 --> 4711.9800000000005
people that follow him are insane

4710.06 --> 4714.02
that actually believe he's a good guy

4711.98 --> 4716.739
they're insane

4714.02 --> 4716.7390000000005
he's not

4719.96 --> 4725.42
I wonder if he even realize like does he

4723.38 --> 4727.58
even realize what he's doing anymore or

4725.42 --> 4729.679
is he just like purely demon-possessed

4727.58 --> 4733.3
now because if you're gonna be into DMT

4729.679 --> 4733.3
and all that [ __ ] constantly

4733.719 --> 4740.84
you absolutely will face situations

4738.86 --> 4744.139999999999
where you're going to be seduced to

4740.84 --> 4746.54
literally hand over your controls to

4744.14 --> 4748.46
extra dimensional entities and I think

4746.54 --> 4751.0
that Rogan's done it

4748.46 --> 4751.0
fully

4757.4 --> 4763.219
taking over for Alex what the [ __ ] are

4760.4 --> 4765.679
you playing what what do you mean take

4763.219 --> 4768.28
it over forever what

4765.679 --> 4768.28
foreign

4771.5 --> 4774.5
Traveler

4784.88 --> 4790.4800000000005
oh okay Moraine

4787.82 --> 4790.48
weird

4798.32 --> 4802.0
that sounds kind of gay though

4802.46 --> 4805.46
foreign

4819.94 --> 4826.0
Jordan Peterson

4822.739 --> 4826.0
it was a total wretch

4826.1 --> 4830.4800000000005
it's like

4827.719 --> 4833.12
if there wasn't somebody like Jim Bob to

4830.48 --> 4835.5199999999995
make fun of him and create like a

4833.12 --> 4838.5199999999995
cartoon character out of him

4835.52 --> 4841.040000000001
he would have been so utterly annoying

4838.52 --> 4843.320000000001
and boring that nobody would yeah I

4841.04 --> 4846.38
wouldn't even know who he is

4843.32 --> 4847.4
I I watched like a speech of him one

4846.38 --> 4851.6
time

4847.4 --> 4852.86
for like three minutes and it was so

4851.6 --> 4855.5
bored

4852.86 --> 4858.92
so bored I had to turn I just can't what

4855.5 --> 4862.719
this so unbelievably boring Jordan

4858.92 --> 4867.04
Peterson is one of the most boring

4862.719 --> 4872.44
pseudo-intellects I've ever come across

4867.04 --> 4872.44
so lame so pointless

4872.54 --> 4878.36
so

4874.4 --> 4882.0199999999995
pretentious it's unbelievable

4878.36 --> 4884.54
I don't understand why that guy has any

4882.02 --> 4887.360000000001
any like

4884.54 --> 4889.699
you say Fame I don't understand I do not

4887.36 --> 4894.339999999999
understand why this guy has any level of

4889.699 --> 4894.339999999999
family so [ __ ] boring

4905.659 --> 4911.199
no he's not letting the curve well not

4908.36 --> 4911.199
that I know of anyway

4915.86 --> 4920.96
which of Jordan's opinion do you agree

4918.139 --> 4922.76
disagree with I don't know his opinions

4920.96 --> 4925.76
I think everything that comes out of him

4922.76 --> 4928.52
is completely pointless and useless I

4925.76 --> 4931.1
think he is just a [ __ ] waste of

4928.52 --> 4933.1990000000005
intellectual space

4931.1 --> 4935.659000000001
I don't even know his real opinions

4933.199 --> 4936.98
because I are but I do know that

4935.659 --> 4938.659
whatever is going to come out of it is

4936.98 --> 4939.678999999999
going to be completely pointless and

4938.659 --> 4943.0
useless

4939.679 --> 4943.0
and distracting

4944.06 --> 4950.54
but maybe if you shared an opinion about

4947.719 --> 4953.54
what he said with me you write it out

4950.54 --> 4955.5199999999995
then I'll say about that what I'll say

4953.54 --> 4957.38
but I don't know any of his opinion I

4955.52 --> 4960.34
just know he's [ __ ] boring and

4957.38 --> 4960.34
completely useless

4960.44 --> 4965.799999999999
it's all just a bunch of

4962.02 --> 4965.8
pseudo-intellectual waffling

4974.78 --> 4980.78
yeah

4976.88 --> 4983.0
I'm not gonna trust you

4980.78 --> 4986.139
and I'm gonna ban you now

4983.0 --> 4986.139
because you're a troll

4987.86 --> 4994.239
thanks for the Super Chat though

4990.8 --> 4994.2390000000005
I don't want you around here

5009.37 --> 5012.439
[Music]

5021.1 --> 5024.0
foreign

5027.04 --> 5031.54
why the [ __ ] would a guy like that be

5029.08 --> 5034.42
talking about the masculine Spirit like

5031.54 --> 5038.4
what about him is actually masculine

5034.42 --> 5038.4
can't seriously think that that's

5038.5 --> 5041.4
like what

5043.9 --> 5047.92
that that's kind of on the same level as

5046.54 --> 5051.5199999999995
what is it

5047.92 --> 5053.08
as as Crowder talking about oh the

5051.52 --> 5055.96
straight man

5053.08 --> 5057.1
we're being like no you're a [ __ ] gay

5055.96 --> 5059.38
guy

5057.1 --> 5062.400000000001
you you don't talk about that it's

5059.38 --> 5062.400000000001
[ __ ] insane

5068.739 --> 5073.239
like what the [ __ ] is masculine about

5071.02 --> 5074.92
what the hell would he even know about

5073.239 --> 5078.459999999999
that

5074.92 --> 5080.32
the guy is gay I'm pretty sure that he

5078.46 --> 5081.82
is gay or secretly I don't want to know

5080.32 --> 5083.139
I don't I just don't want to know

5081.82 --> 5085.48
anything about it just know everything

5083.139 --> 5088.4800000000005
he says is [ __ ] always

5085.48 --> 5088.48
[ __ ]

5122.679 --> 5128.32
yeah there are no no yeah there are

5125.38 --> 5130.56
plenty of females might not be in here

5128.32 --> 5130.5599999999995
now

5131.08 --> 5133.92
but yeah

5148.9 --> 5156.219
why why do you care Rick back like why

5153.04 --> 5158.199
are you saying I can respect what why

5156.219 --> 5160.659
why do you give a [ __ ] what that

5158.199 --> 5164.5
freaking ass wipe is saying

5160.659 --> 5167.62
oh oh oh he's not against me who gives a

5164.5 --> 5169.12
[ __ ] it's all just a bunch of Chess to

5167.62 --> 5171.4
them

5169.12 --> 5174.639
oh I like him now because he's against

5171.4 --> 5175.719
that other [ __ ] up psychopath oh

5174.639 --> 5178.0
really

5175.719 --> 5179.9800000000005
you think that's gonna actually make a

5178.0 --> 5182.5
difference about anything

5179.98 --> 5183.4
why do you say that you respect him for

5182.5 --> 5186.58
that

5183.4 --> 5189.5199999999995
it's a blatant ruse

5186.58 --> 5192.34
it's a rose

5189.52 --> 5195.040000000001
oh I'm against it but yeah that's a ruse

5192.34 --> 5197.76
who gets a [ __ ] what that guy thinks

5195.04 --> 5197.76
about anything

5198.46 --> 5203.679
but you respect him now because he spoke

5201.04 --> 5206.199
out against Bezos really that deserves

5203.679 --> 5208.4800000000005
his respect in contrast to all that

5206.199 --> 5212.379999999999
garbage that comes out of him who gives

5208.48 --> 5214.86
a [ __ ] what that ass wipe says

5212.38 --> 5219.179
I'm more interested in Jim Bob's version

5214.86 --> 5219.179
that one is actually entertaining

5223.42 --> 5227.82
many women exp that's disgusting

5228.219 --> 5233.139
that's absolutely gross

5231.28 --> 5235.0
no need um

5233.139 --> 5238.62
I don't know what type of things he is

5235.0 --> 5238.62
attracted but they're deranged

5254.699 --> 5262.08
oh oh okay

5258.239 --> 5265.678999999999
okay you're talking about

5262.08 --> 5268.42
oh okay sorry I misread that

5265.679 --> 5270.4
dude I don't know freaking brand names

5268.42 --> 5273.219
okay I don't know brand names for

5270.4 --> 5277.48
pharmaceuticals because I never

5273.219 --> 5278.159
ever take them ever ever ever ever ever

5277.48 --> 5281.44
ever

5278.159 --> 5284.799999999999
I don't know the names because I never

5281.44 --> 5288.4
take that [ __ ] ever even if I have pain

5284.8 --> 5291.58
I don't take it nothing ever

5288.4 --> 5294.339999999999
don't even consider asking about what's

5291.58 --> 5297.58
out there that's how never ever I take

5294.34 --> 5300.1
it right so I I read besos in there okay

5297.58 --> 5302.26
so he oh he beat a drug addiction well

5300.1 --> 5304.9800000000005
maybe he shouldn't gotten on them

5302.26 --> 5304.9800000000005
huh

5307.9 --> 5311.86
besides how do you know that he's

5310.0 --> 5315.96
actually beating it maybe that's just

5311.86 --> 5315.96
another stupid story he's lying about

5316.3 --> 5322.7390000000005
I don't trust the guy he's he's probably

5319.239 --> 5322.739
a pathological liar

5377.86 --> 5382.239
is that a question to me Fisher from

5380.02 --> 5384.400000000001
Eden because you do realize I am

5382.239 --> 5387.638999999999
literally on the Flat Earth debate since

5384.4 --> 5391.379999999999
episode 80 or something right

5387.639 --> 5391.38
I am a standard part of that show

5408.34 --> 5412.02
oh by the way I finally figured out how

5410.98 --> 5414.94
to

5412.02 --> 5417.6990000000005
negate that stupid pop-up sound from

5414.94 --> 5419.379999999999
Skype so there's no more pop-up sounds I

5417.699 --> 5422.5199999999995
should have figured out how to turn that

5419.38 --> 5426.04
off a long time ago but there's no more

5422.52 --> 5427.84
stupid sound I hate that sound

5426.04 --> 5430.179
I mean it's kind of useful when you're

5427.84 --> 5431.38
just chatting but to have that in the

5430.179 --> 5434.139
background while you're doing a stream

5431.38 --> 5435.46
super annoying so I I know I've turned

5434.139 --> 5437.9800000000005
it off

5435.46 --> 5441.12
no more stupid pop-up sounds

5437.98 --> 5444.599999999999
whoo only took me

5441.12 --> 5444.599999999999
1155 episodes

5459.96 --> 5463.62
are you asking me

5463.96 --> 5468.0
are you asking somebody else what

5502.3 --> 5508.06
yeah thanks for that Stevie Traveler

5505.54 --> 5509.8
now I just never even thought of that

5508.06 --> 5512.26
hey maybe you could turn that stupid

5509.8 --> 5516.179
sound off I just realized yesterday like

5512.26 --> 5516.179
hey wait what if I look in the settings

5516.52 --> 5521.7390000000005
and then

5518.8 --> 5524.26
like notifications and yeah there it was

5521.739 --> 5526.659
like oh [ __ ] you can actually turn that

5524.26 --> 5529.179
off okay

5526.659 --> 5531.879999999999
just came up with that

5529.179 --> 5533.5
never even it wasn't like I can't find

5531.88 --> 5535.12
it I don't know how to turn it off it

5533.5 --> 5537.04
wasn't like that for four years straight

5535.12 --> 5538.96
or something no I just didn't even

5537.04 --> 5541.44
realize you could turn it off

5538.96 --> 5541.44
foreign

5588.639 --> 5591.719
you have a channel

5593.679 --> 5596.46
hmm

5596.86 --> 5600.0599999999995
I guess you do

5631.62 --> 5636.699
asking you oh goody oh yeah because

5634.9 --> 5638.98
that's

5636.699 --> 5641.799999999999
no seriously sizing up your own

5638.98 --> 5644.5
masculinity is kind of gay

5641.8 --> 5646.7390000000005
besides it's not that simple

5644.5 --> 5650.98
I have a

5646.739 --> 5653.86
very Dynamic personality range that

5650.98 --> 5655.54
means I can actually be

5653.86 --> 5658.659
kind of

5655.54 --> 5661.9
feminine but not a feminate not [ __ ]

5658.659 --> 5663.46
but actually like a a mother type figure

5661.9 --> 5667.12
I can't be like that I have the

5663.46 --> 5669.9
instincts right both father and mother I

5667.12 --> 5673.139
can also be like extremely

5669.9 --> 5675.759999999999
cave-manish and dominant and just like

5673.139 --> 5678.159000000001
you're like with a girlfriend hey if

5675.76 --> 5680.1990000000005
they like it I can be like yeah you are

5678.159 --> 5683.5599999999995
my women you're gonna do exactly what I

5680.199 --> 5685.0
say but if you if it might hurt you I'll

5683.56 --> 5688.780000000001
like

5685.0 --> 5690.94
not do that so yeah I can be extremely

5688.78 --> 5695.199
male

5690.94 --> 5697.96
and like a a primal way but I can also

5695.199 --> 5700.48
like not be like that I have a very

5697.96 --> 5702.219
Dynamic personality range I'm basically

5700.48 --> 5703.599999999999
three people I've been saying that for

5702.219 --> 5706.36
years

5703.6 --> 5709.119000000001
yes that kind of makes me crazy

5706.36 --> 5711.46
but yeah I'm not denying that I am kind

5709.119 --> 5713.86
of crazy I mean I think I had experience

5711.46 --> 5716.04
that would make any person start raving

5713.86 --> 5716.04
mad

5716.199 --> 5723.219
right you try and survive being 80 years

5719.56 --> 5726.780000000001
locked into a tortured dream

5723.219 --> 5726.78
see how you get out of that

5731.98 --> 5736.48
right

5733.179 --> 5739.06
but yeah I can be

5736.48 --> 5741.94
well the thing is I just my physical

5739.06 --> 5744.46
build doesn't really allow me to be like

5741.94 --> 5747.58
maximized and I will never be like a big

5744.46 --> 5750.34
Hulk type of guy that can just use that

5747.58 --> 5752.76
type of male brutal power

5750.34 --> 5752.76
right

5752.86 --> 5759.5199999999995
so I I could never pass by like an eight

5757.0 --> 5763.86
but I'll not be like an eight constantly

5759.52 --> 5763.860000000001
that makes no sense that's not effective

5770.32 --> 5776.92
and when an average my my demeanor as to

5773.98 --> 5779.4
what I think I am where I'm at I'd say

5776.92 --> 5779.4
six

5779.8 --> 5785.139
there's parts that I very much emphasize

5783.1 --> 5786.46
that are male and there are Parts where

5785.139 --> 5789.6990000000005
I kind of

5786.46 --> 5790.96
don't really do much with it

5789.699 --> 5793.599999999999
right

5790.96 --> 5795.82
so there are parts that I feel like I'm

5793.6 --> 5797.619000000001
maximizing it the male aspect but

5795.82 --> 5799.84
there's parts that I'm let I'm not doing

5797.619 --> 5801.699
anything with that so it can never be a

5799.84 --> 5803.619000000001
full 10.

5801.699 --> 5807.178999999999
I don't know I don't know why I just

5803.619 --> 5807.179
took that all so serious

5811.179 --> 5814.86
so on average I say six

5831.58 --> 5834.94
you want to hear about that sometime

5833.199 --> 5837.159
okay well then keep following my channel

5834.94 --> 5838.54
right back because I I talk about it

5837.159 --> 5840.28
regularly

5838.54 --> 5842.26
it's something that happened I've been

5840.28 --> 5843.94
talking about that since my very first

5842.26 --> 5848.46
Hangouts

5843.94 --> 5848.46
talk about divisions the Dark World

5851.199 --> 5855.4
right I've been tapping into that

5853.3 --> 5858.1
separately but I also had this one

5855.4 --> 5860.259999999999
Monumental big thing that is just it's

5858.1 --> 5864.900000000001
it's undescribable

5860.26 --> 5864.900000000001
it's too much it's freaking 80 years

5865.119 --> 5871.839999999999
just think of like a like a maximized

5868.38 --> 5874.719
hallucination trip that's kind of

5871.84 --> 5877.78
controlled that literally reveals the

5874.719 --> 5880.84
future and it never stops

5877.78 --> 5883.3
I thought that I was dead when I entered

5880.84 --> 5886.38
that I thought that I was actually my

5883.3 --> 5886.38
physical body was dead

5891.4 --> 5896.739
it was absolutely crazy I I don't

5894.82 --> 5898.599999999999
understand even what happened I don't

5896.739 --> 5900.638999999999
know what happened I don't know the

5898.6 --> 5902.8
substances that were involved I don't

5900.639 --> 5904.96
even know exactly when it happened or

5902.8 --> 5907.179
how it happened I don't understand what

5904.96 --> 5909.699
happened I just know I had that

5907.179 --> 5912.04
experience and I can never forget it and

5909.699 --> 5914.678999999999
it's still reflecting on me with things

5912.04 --> 5916.36
that are happening in the current day

5914.679 --> 5919.0
there's still things that I've seen

5916.36 --> 5922.0
coming and like that's like 20 years ago

5919.0 --> 5925.5
more than 20 years ago

5922.0 --> 5925.5
it was when I was 17.

5929.32 --> 5932.04
I think

5936.04 --> 5941.699
or maybe it was 21. I don't know it's so

5938.8 --> 5941.6990000000005
complicated man

5951.1 --> 5955.7390000000005
like even sometimes I really wonder

5953.86 --> 5960.04
whether that experience literally

5955.739 --> 5964.0599999999995
injected retroactive dreams

5960.04 --> 5966.639
like they get meddled with time itself

5964.06 --> 5970.0
because

5966.639 --> 5972.1
when it happened I basically seemed to

5970.0 --> 5974.86
remember things that happened in my past

5972.1 --> 5977.02
like vividly I would go through them

5974.86 --> 5978.82
again

5977.02 --> 5980.7390000000005
even though I'm not sure that actually

5978.82 --> 5983.32
happened because I didn't remember it

5980.739 --> 5985.48
before that time after that time it's

5983.32 --> 5988.32
like it's always been there it's so

5985.48 --> 5988.32
bizarre

5991.78 --> 5996.599999999999
like my Dark World memories

5994.9 --> 6000.5599999999995
dug back

5996.6 --> 6000.56
rectroactively in that event

6001.5 --> 6009.179
they basically almost like

6004.86 --> 6011.88
filled itself in to my dream memories

6009.179 --> 6014.1
of the past and then it literally

6011.88 --> 6018.139
integrated and it fitted that's the

6014.1 --> 6018.139
crazy part it all actually fitted

6022.5 --> 6027.179
was my vision Crystal Clear like high

6024.719 --> 6031.619
definition clear yeah

6027.179 --> 6035.28
it was like really high definition lucid

6031.619 --> 6035.28
dreaming level Holodeck

6047.89 --> 6051.069
[Music]

6056.58 --> 6061.86
it's similar what you had similar

6058.86 --> 6063.42
experience of an 80-year nightmare

6061.86 --> 6065.759999999999
laughs

6063.42 --> 6067.26
I don't hope so Rick Beck I don't know

6065.76 --> 6069.659000000001
but

6067.26 --> 6071.639
like that was not a natural event though

6069.659 --> 6073.92
I'm pretty sure that some kind of a drug

6071.639 --> 6076.34
was involved I just don't know what what

6073.92 --> 6076.34
it was

6078.239 --> 6084.199
and I did not have control over it

6081.719 --> 6087.86
I was basically doing like a wild

6084.199 --> 6087.86
experiment on myself

6087.96 --> 6092.46
because I was just consumed with

6090.239 --> 6094.138999999999
curiosity in that time period I was

6092.46 --> 6096.6
consumed with it

6094.139 --> 6099.2390000000005
it's like I had been protecting myself

6096.6 --> 6101.639
from a lot yeah from allowing myself to

6099.239 --> 6105.0599999999995
realize what the world was really like

6101.639 --> 6109.28
just so I could be myself and survive

6105.06 --> 6111.719
but as a counter effect it made me like

6109.28 --> 6113.219
insatiably curious as to what it

6111.719 --> 6115.199
actually was that I was hiding from

6113.219 --> 6116.52
myself and that's how I think I stumbled

6115.199 --> 6118.259999999999
into it

6116.52 --> 6120.96
that's how I

6118.26 --> 6123.92
I made some really stupid decisions

6120.96 --> 6126.6
based on my curiosity that I cannot even

6123.92 --> 6129.06
figure out how I could have not done it

6126.6 --> 6133.34
it was like inevitable

6129.06 --> 6133.34
and it's very painful

6133.679 --> 6136.58
to know that

6148.5 --> 6153.0
but yeah it was partially through my

6150.78 --> 6154.139
vision experiences that I learned about

6153.0 --> 6158.659
Flat Earth

6154.139 --> 6158.659000000001
ahead of time it was really weird

6159.3 --> 6163.76
like how I learned about it even in my

6161.46 --> 6163.76
youth

6168.0 --> 6170.719
oops

6171.6 --> 6175.7390000000005
because it seemed like in the physical

6173.76 --> 6178.5
world

6175.739 --> 6180.0599999999995
I wasn't able to talk about it except

6178.5 --> 6182.52
with my parents and they didn't really

6180.06 --> 6184.619000000001
know that much about it themselves they

6182.52 --> 6186.540000000001
hadn't like really fanatically dug into

6184.619 --> 6189.42
it and knew everything right no they

6186.54 --> 6190.739
didn't they just kind of came past it

6189.42 --> 6192.9
and they were like oh this is really

6190.739 --> 6194.459999999999
interesting

6192.9 --> 6196.44
but then

6194.46 --> 6201.44
in dreams

6196.44 --> 6201.44
I would have technical conversation dude

6201.78 --> 6207.719
this is going to sound really weird okay

6204.0 --> 6210.179
but in my vision and that's like 97

6207.719 --> 6214.02
guaranteed 97

6210.179 --> 6218.82
I had a four look to rumpus

6214.02 --> 6222.02
I was with rumpus as he was creating the

6218.82 --> 6226.5
terrestrial refraction formula I saw it

6222.02 --> 6230.580000000001
way back then like in like this super

6226.5 --> 6234.36
bright space like a class it was so real

6230.58 --> 6239.36
so bizarre but I saw that [ __ ] I saw

6234.36 --> 6239.36
like flatter debate what was going on

6240.54 --> 6245.4
and like people like rumpus and how he

6243.659 --> 6247.44
would

6245.4 --> 6251.339999999999
like build this

6247.44 --> 6253.98
mechanic and I I was a glober I was

6251.34 --> 6256.679
really haunted I was really I was Bowing

6253.98 --> 6259.619
in that time so to me it was like oh

6256.679 --> 6262.639
this is really fascinating oh this is so

6259.619 --> 6262.639
smartly created

6265.44 --> 6268.5199999999995
that's

6266.639 --> 6271.139
yeah it's

6268.52 --> 6274.080000000001
decades ago

6271.139 --> 6276.4800000000005
I had these experience I'd met all these

6274.08 --> 6278.639
people through the vision I

6276.48 --> 6281.28
like seen so many people that I've

6278.639 --> 6287.42
bumped into on the Flat Earth scene

6281.28 --> 6287.42
and that was 25 years ago I saw them

6292.92 --> 6297.4800000000005
one of the first flat earthers that I

6295.199 --> 6300.419999999999
bumped into in my vision was David Wise

6297.48 --> 6303.718999999999
I even told him to his face when I first

6300.42 --> 6306.679
met him over Skype

6303.719 --> 6306.679
foreign

6311.48 --> 6316.799999999999
no it's really not that bad

6314.639 --> 6318.84
it was the vision wasn't just like

6316.8 --> 6320.639
Nathan Oakley and rhombus and rumpus

6318.84 --> 6323.46
stuttering and being annoying in our

6320.639 --> 6326.52
room is no it wasn't that it was behind

6323.46 --> 6328.44
the scenes he was doing math he was

6326.52 --> 6331.02
trying to figure out the formula I was

6328.44 --> 6333.199
actually interested in in helping him

6331.02 --> 6333.1990000000005
out

6334.92 --> 6339.619
right

6336.48 --> 6339.619
in 97

6339.9 --> 6344.94
where none of it had happened yet

6343.32 --> 6348.5
yeah

6344.94 --> 6348.5
I don't know how to explain that

6349.56 --> 6356.219
but no I rumpus romper's Vision rumpus

6354.3 --> 6360.860000000001
it really isn't all that bad

6356.219 --> 6360.86
he's just like really fanatic

6362.76 --> 6368.96
did rumpus invent the terrestrial

6364.56 --> 6368.96
refraction formula yes I think he did

6370.8 --> 6375.54
I mean the concept of terrestrial

6372.78 --> 6377.639
refraction had existed already but I

6375.54 --> 6380.88
think that he actually like worked it

6377.639 --> 6383.36
out or maybe it wasn't him but he was he

6380.88 --> 6383.36
was there

6384.78 --> 6388.86
I'm not sure it wasn't that long and

6386.58 --> 6391.739
it's not like I sat through an hour of

6388.86 --> 6394.44
him riding it out or so no it was like

6391.739 --> 6396.98
short parts

6394.44 --> 6396.98
right

6397.56 --> 6405.0
the total amount of time in the vision I

6401.159 --> 6407.58
spent with him was really not that long

6405.0 --> 6409.98
and when it was over I was like oh but I

6407.58 --> 6412.08
think that's cool I I like that Globe

6409.98 --> 6414.178999999999
math and all that I'm interested

6412.08 --> 6416.04
because I was interested I was not

6414.179 --> 6418.619
interested in all learning it by heart

6416.04 --> 6422.76
myself in the physical world but I was

6418.619 --> 6425.639
curious to get a feel of what it is

6422.76 --> 6428.0
and rumpus helped me out with that in

6425.639 --> 6428.0
the vision

6431.219 --> 6435.36
although by the way never really got a

6433.08 --> 6437.82
good look so he always basically looked

6435.36 --> 6439.86
like the the one photograph we have of

6437.82 --> 6443.88
him that we identify him with that's how

6439.86 --> 6446.099999999999
he looked in more like a 3D form

6443.88 --> 6449.4800000000005
but he did have the romper's voice even

6446.1 --> 6449.4800000000005
back then it's so weird

6464.82 --> 6469.799999999999
all right so it's always been my

6466.619 --> 6473.58
suspicion that for some in some way what

6469.8 --> 6476.76
I experienced allowed me and other

6473.58 --> 6479.219
entities because I was being [ __ ] with

6476.76 --> 6481.26
demons pretty sure there was some dark

6479.219 --> 6483.84
[ __ ] happening and I've been very

6481.26 --> 6485.46
defensive about it throughout the entire

6483.84 --> 6487.860000000001
thing that's what made it so torturous

6485.46 --> 6490.679
because I was never planning to like

6487.86 --> 6492.78
surrender or anything ever

6490.679 --> 6495.54
so I was just like I'm expecting that

6492.78 --> 6497.5199999999995
like that was like it was basically in

6495.54 --> 6499.08
my own mind a holy Mission and I was

6497.52 --> 6501.659000000001
sure I was gonna get killed it was like

6499.08 --> 6503.4
a spiritual suicide bombing in a way to

6501.659 --> 6505.44
me

6503.4 --> 6508.04
dude I've been

6505.44 --> 6508.04
ugh

6508.92 --> 6513.4800000000005
but

6510.6 --> 6516.3
I realized afterward when I did wake up

6513.48 --> 6519.36
from it that whoa

6516.3 --> 6522.6
it's like I had access to everything

6519.36 --> 6526.88
throughout time but through my memories

6522.6 --> 6526.88
through my memories in the future

6527.82 --> 6533.34
and things were like Hollow decked like

6530.659 --> 6537.659
reconstructed from those memories in the

6533.34 --> 6540.6
future but the memories also included

6537.659 --> 6542.759999999999
my fantasy imagery

6540.6 --> 6546.659000000001
is I've actually been confronted more

6542.76 --> 6546.659000000001
with my own imaginations

6546.78 --> 6551.28
than with actual physical memories from

6549.96 --> 6553.8
The Real World

6551.28 --> 6556.139
because I there were some of those I had

6553.8 --> 6558.119000000001
actually like seen things that were

6556.139 --> 6561.08
actually physically here like I

6558.119 --> 6561.08
recognized places

6561.239 --> 6566.94
like I went into this shop one time

6564.48 --> 6568.08
and then I'm like holy [ __ ] I've been

6566.94 --> 6571.379999999999
here

6568.08 --> 6573.36
I there was Envision right so I did get

6571.38 --> 6577.1990000000005
get to see

6573.36 --> 6579.239
parts of physical world experience it

6577.199 --> 6582.0599999999995
wasn't just imaginary but I have seen

6579.239 --> 6585.659
imagination things I saw

6582.06 --> 6587.099
The Four Horsemen of the eclipse

6585.659 --> 6590.04
painted

6587.099 --> 6592.26
as it was painted in my mind I actually

6590.04 --> 6595.199
asked at some point during that entire

6592.26 --> 6598.320000000001
vision is there any way that I can

6595.199 --> 6601.619
literally like print out what I'm seeing

6598.32 --> 6605.4
right now because this is amazing in my

6601.619 --> 6608.159
imagination it paints really really

6605.4 --> 6610.138999999999
amazingly it's just that I could never

6608.159 --> 6612.119
then translate and in the physical world

6610.139 --> 6614.82
into an actual painting my painting

6612.119 --> 6618.0599999999995
skills are not really that great in

6614.82 --> 6619.259999999999
translating things that I see projected

6618.06 --> 6622.26
in my mind

6619.26 --> 6622.26
unfortunately

6622.86 --> 6627.659
and then later it eventually developed

6625.44 --> 6630.839999999999
into the idea that maybe at some point

6627.659 --> 6632.46
there will be mind interfaces like not a

6630.84 --> 6634.1990000000005
[ __ ] chip in your head but just a

6632.46 --> 6637.219
little Crown you

6634.199 --> 6641.098999999999
that could literally tap into your

6637.219 --> 6642.36
visual cortex and then print out your

6641.099 --> 6645.119000000001
imagination

6642.36 --> 6647.699
yeah talking about that's a little

6645.119 --> 6650.339999999999
techno drop here right for the

6647.699 --> 6652.919999999999
holographic H there might be a point

6650.34 --> 6654.96
where you could literally print out your

6652.92 --> 6657.599
imagination

6654.96 --> 6659.52
it's not a joke that might actually

6657.599 --> 6661.4400000000005
become possible

6659.52 --> 6664.679
in the near future

6661.44 --> 6665.879999999999
and it's gonna absolutely devastate the

6664.679 --> 6669.06
entire

6665.88 --> 6672.119
Artistry it's gonna destroy it

6669.06 --> 6674.400000000001
it is and it's a tragedy but it will

6672.119 --> 6677.82
show things from people's imagination

6674.4 --> 6681.259999999999
that are just like whoa

6677.82 --> 6681.259999999999
both light and dark

6685.98 --> 6691.0199999999995
oh come on who the hell are you

6688.5 --> 6692.76
[ __ ] out here scum

6691.02 --> 6694.619000000001
this is all real I'm talking about

6692.76 --> 6697.619000000001
things that I've actually experienced

6694.619 --> 6700.679
okay that's real I'm not encouraging

6697.619 --> 6703.44
anybody to do I don't even [ __ ] know

6700.679 --> 6705.2390000000005
how it happened okay I don't know how it

6703.44 --> 6707.879999999999
happened

6705.239 --> 6711.379999999999
I don't know I just know what I

6707.88 --> 6711.38
experienced and I'm trying to

6713.099 --> 6718.1990000000005
drank to write out my journey I'm just

6715.56 --> 6720.900000000001
trying to record it I feel like I'm I'm

6718.199 --> 6722.82
a bar trying to record history of

6720.9 --> 6725.098999999999
another dimension

6722.82 --> 6727.5
I'm a planar traveler into the other

6725.099 --> 6729.2390000000005
dimension and I have a vivid memory of

6727.5 --> 6731.76
everything that happened and I'm still

6729.239 --> 6734.239
trying to place everything that happened

6731.76 --> 6734.2390000000005
in there

6743.88 --> 6746.42
right

6747.92 --> 6754.02
but hey if anybody's like oh I want that

6750.659 --> 6756.0599999999995
I would know you [ __ ] don't okay when

6754.02 --> 6759.02
I say 80 years

6756.06 --> 6759.02
foreign

6764.96 --> 6770.76
like you go around YouTube whatever and

6767.94 --> 6772.739
you yeah you click on the video and then

6770.76 --> 6775.26
it gets kind of scary and [ __ ] up or

6772.739 --> 6777.54
somebody gets psycho like Psychopathic

6775.26 --> 6780.4800000000005
about something right then you can be

6777.54 --> 6782.88
like uh and click it away

6780.48 --> 6785.04
right because it's like gross that's

6782.88 --> 6787.02
disgusting I don't care for that I hate

6785.04 --> 6789.84
this channel now whatever right that's a

6787.02 --> 6793.080000000001
natural response guess what while I was

6789.84 --> 6796.139
in there I was made to face things and I

6793.08 --> 6799.619
could not stop it I could not turn it

6796.139 --> 6802.4400000000005
off I had to feel it I'd had it would

6799.619 --> 6806.159
change my spirit and it was nothing I

6802.44 --> 6808.739
can do about it and then 80 years 80

6806.159 --> 6811.0199999999995
years yeah I don't recommend anybody

6808.739 --> 6813.299999999999
tried to repeat what I experienced I

6811.02 --> 6814.320000000001
absolutely recommend against it it is

6813.3 --> 6816.3
torture

6814.32 --> 6819.619
most people that'll get out of it will

6816.3 --> 6819.619000000001
be completely insane

6826.32 --> 6830.0599999999995
I don't even know what I did

6831.719 --> 6836.82
I just know I don't recommend it and I

6834.36 --> 6839.46
know that if I hadn't

6836.82 --> 6843.259999999999
I my life might have been halfway normal

6839.46 --> 6843.26
then again what I wanted

6843.36 --> 6848.28
so I get into like a paradoxical

6845.88 --> 6850.8
situation about it like

6848.28 --> 6854.599
if I hadn't done it then I would never

6850.8 --> 6854.599
have known not to have done it

6855.119 --> 6859.46
it wouldn't have yeah this

6866.099 --> 6872.099
our Visions from Satan the dark side

6870.06 --> 6875.159000000001
well

6872.099 --> 6878.28
he was there

6875.159 --> 6881.098999999999
I think that Satan if that's even like a

6878.28 --> 6884.699
singular entity that forced the darkness

6881.099 --> 6887.2390000000005
it was pushing itself on me

6884.699 --> 6887.239
yeah

6887.28 --> 6891.42
it was the thing that was trying to show

6889.44 --> 6893.28
that everything was pointless and that

6891.42 --> 6895.139
the only thing I would have to do is

6893.28 --> 6898.679
just surrender

6895.139 --> 6900.599
the thing that was hurting me my soul in

6898.679 --> 6904.02
the face of the reality that it was

6900.599 --> 6907.58
showing me yeah

6904.02 --> 6907.580000000001
so I'm not denying that

6908.76 --> 6912.96
and there were absolutely demons

6910.739 --> 6916.259999999999
involved I've seen literal like

6912.96 --> 6918.9
demonic-like figures

6916.26 --> 6920.9400000000005
try to stay clear of them I never even

6918.9 --> 6922.799999999999
tried to like engage with it like At

6920.94 --> 6925.44
first I just wanted to understand like

6922.8 --> 6928.1990000000005
what the [ __ ] is this

6925.44 --> 6931.379999999999
where am I what is this place how can I

6928.199 --> 6933.659
be in different physical landscapes and

6931.38 --> 6935.58
then switch

6933.659 --> 6939.619
there were all these different types of

6935.58 --> 6939.619
places too not just events

6958.38 --> 6965.639
big into divination found God alike well

6962.76 --> 6968.52
I don't see how divination and God

6965.639 --> 6970.679
necessarily are separate

6968.52 --> 6973.38
I think if you're Guided by God

6970.679 --> 6975.06
definition actually works great it's

6973.38 --> 6977.9400000000005
just that are you gonna let the

6975.06 --> 6979.38
Divination distract you away from the

6977.94 --> 6980.5199999999995
more direct connection

6979.38 --> 6984.0
right

6980.52 --> 6985.7390000000005
it's like are you if you could gain

6984.0 --> 6987.659
technical I'm talking about a computer

6985.739 --> 6989.339999999999
game now right for example if you could

6987.659 --> 6991.5599999999995
do magic with your hand are you going to

6989.34 --> 6993.84
insist on using that one because it

6991.56 --> 6996.599
works slightly better but if that using

6993.84 --> 6998.9400000000005
that wand eventually makes you lose or

6996.599 --> 7001.46
lower the quality of your just straight

6998.94 --> 7004.759999999999
out right

7001.46 --> 7007.58
that's definition it's a tool

7004.76 --> 7009.7390000000005
it doesn't automatically detach you from

7007.58 --> 7012.92
God that's nonsense

7009.739 --> 7017.119
but if you think that there is like

7012.92 --> 7019.4
power in divination then that might

7017.119 --> 7022.28
create a longing that will eventually

7019.4 --> 7025.58
separate you from God as you do

7022.28 --> 7028.0
divination you see Power is seducing in

7025.58 --> 7028.0
any form

7033.139 --> 7038.84
what is a difference

7035.179 --> 7040.76
in you what is a different you in

7038.84 --> 7042.1990000000005
different what

7040.76 --> 7043.88
now there were just different places

7042.199 --> 7045.919999999999
there was a place that was kind of

7043.88 --> 7048.4400000000005
associated with hell even it was a giant

7045.92 --> 7051.02
desert Rocky desert

7048.44 --> 7052.638999999999
and it was red light it was really

7051.02 --> 7055.88
freaky

7052.639 --> 7059.679
and there were a literal red skinned

7055.88 --> 7059.679
horned Devils there

7061.58 --> 7066.199
I've been there

7063.02 --> 7070.719
I've literally had a

7066.199 --> 7073.638999999999
like a debate with a devil and I won

7070.719 --> 7076.099
that was one of the more funny memories

7073.639 --> 7078.26
actually I had a flat Earth debate with

7076.099 --> 7080.719
the devil and I won

7078.26 --> 7083.4800000000005
and he was really pissed off at that but

7080.719 --> 7085.04
he couldn't do anything

7083.48 --> 7087.678999999999
he thought that he could take me over

7085.04 --> 7089.98
through reasoning and then I proved him

7087.679 --> 7089.9800000000005
wrong

7095.659 --> 7099.799999999999
it was a PR kind of bizarre experience

7097.94 --> 7102.5599999999995
because

7099.8 --> 7104.42
it started out in a Holodeck where I was

7102.56 --> 7106.099
basically sitting behind a desk with

7104.42 --> 7108.7390000000005
another person in front of me was in a

7106.099 --> 7111.38
building kind of beautiful building

7108.739 --> 7113.659
not super big room or anything

7111.38 --> 7116.54
and then I was debating

7113.659 --> 7117.799999999999
about the Flat Earth against the globe

7116.54 --> 7120.32
earther

7117.8 --> 7122.84
and it was like really on this is not

7120.32 --> 7124.34
just some rumpus or a general that was

7122.84 --> 7126.8
like a devil that had all the

7124.34 --> 7129.08
information available somehow

7126.8 --> 7131.179
and I thought at first like oh [ __ ] I'm

7129.08 --> 7133.58
getting judged like he was trying to

7131.179 --> 7136.28
turn it off he was trying to break me in

7133.58 --> 7139.5199999999995
the flare but then I also gained access

7136.28 --> 7142.639
to I guess the future or something

7139.52 --> 7144.56
my own future discoveries myself my own

7142.639 --> 7146.84
information from the future and I

7144.56 --> 7150.26
actually then completely Outreach in him

7146.84 --> 7154.400000000001
in every corner and then eventually like

7150.26 --> 7156.26
the Hologram broke and then I saw it

7154.4 --> 7158.36
wasn't a person it was actually a red

7156.26 --> 7159.619000000001
devil sitting in front of me and we were

7158.36 --> 7163.28
in the desert

7159.619 --> 7164.9
that was a really weird experience very

7163.28 --> 7169.0
very detailed

7164.9 --> 7169.0
very vividly In My Memory still

7171.92 --> 7176.32
yeah and by the way I was not a red

7173.96 --> 7176.32
devil

7176.599 --> 7184.46
huh I was this color skin

7180.8 --> 7186.619000000001
and I had pretty much this on I it was

7184.46 --> 7188.3
just this this is what I've always

7186.619 --> 7191.32
looked like this it's what I looked like

7188.3 --> 7191.320000000001
in the Visions too

7198.02 --> 7203.619000000001
what is the formula for solving a right

7200.78 --> 7203.619
try what

7204.02 --> 7209.2390000000005
yeah look dude just because in that

7206.9 --> 7211.82
other dimension I had like all available

7209.239 --> 7214.759999999999
information from Air everywhere

7211.82 --> 7217.219
doesn't mean that in the time-bound

7214.76 --> 7218.599
linear reality physical reality I have

7217.219 --> 7220.34
that

7218.599 --> 7222.4400000000005
in a physical reality I've never been

7220.34 --> 7225.679
really good at math on the other side

7222.44 --> 7227.119
however I was absolute master I didn't

7225.679 --> 7229.4
even have to think I could just

7227.119 --> 7232.119
literally just this is it

7229.4 --> 7232.119
that is it

7243.02 --> 7248.0
yeah good and impressed think about it

7244.76 --> 7250.46
carefully because yeah definition all

7248.0 --> 7253.159
kinds of these like magic tricks you

7250.46 --> 7256.82
could say but not magician traits but

7253.159 --> 7260.179
like magical power related tricks yeah

7256.82 --> 7262.239
all of them have like a risk factor

7260.179 --> 7265.159
every time it's like you use a power

7262.239 --> 7267.44
then the darkness comes in to tempt you

7265.159 --> 7269.839999999999
it always happens it's the corruption

7267.44 --> 7272.48
that comes with the power whether it is

7269.84 --> 7274.88
power over other people a society a

7272.48 --> 7277.5199999999995
function or whether it is like energy

7274.88 --> 7279.56
power it's all the same it always has

7277.52 --> 7281.900000000001
the same effect

7279.56 --> 7284.360000000001
power will seduce you doesn't matter

7281.9 --> 7286.94
whether it is like societal power or

7284.36 --> 7289.9
energy power

7286.94 --> 7289.9
it always does

7290.36 --> 7293.92
it's an eternal struggle

7297.32 --> 7300.98
and yeah if you get greedy you want more

7299.3 --> 7304.219
you want to become better you want more

7300.98 --> 7307.459999999999
then there will be more seduction more

7304.219 --> 7308.54
risk and that's just how it works

7307.46 --> 7311.3
right

7308.54 --> 7312.86
anyway take a two minute break we're

7311.3 --> 7315.139
probably gonna round out it after that

7312.86 --> 7317.78
but it's a really interesting show so

7315.139 --> 7320.4400000000005
maybe I won't stop

7317.78 --> 7320.44

energetics

7440.599 --> 7443.679
never sought them out

7455.96 --> 7462.199
although yeah in my teens I was really

7459.44 --> 7464.96
curious at it but it was also scared

7462.199 --> 7466.699
I wasn't like oh yeah party party no no

two-hour show

except then I I didn't even realize what

7545.0 --> 7550.78
it was I just thought it was dreams

7547.219 --> 7550.78
but they weren't just dreams

7553.52 --> 7558.02
but even in my preteens I kind of

7555.44 --> 7560.598999999999
realized and my parents realized that I

7558.02 --> 7562.579000000001
could kind of like see into the future I

7560.599 --> 7564.7390000000005
could literally see into the future

7562.579 --> 7568.48
things that I didn't even understand yet

7564.739 --> 7568.48
and I will talk about it

7572.96 --> 7578.179
it was weird

7575.84 --> 7579.9800000000005

really like a little special boy like

7579.98 --> 7582.159

7639.44 --> 7643.46
the future when I was

7641.659 --> 7645.32
like

7643.46 --> 7649.179
10 or something

7645.32 --> 7649.179
and I did not like what I see

7653.179 --> 7658.099

but from the other side
