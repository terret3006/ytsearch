so the weather is

81.84 --> 90.799
very different today very different

87.28 --> 94.159
it's almost completely wind still

90.799 --> 94.64
it's super moist it's cloudy and it's

94.159 --> 98.0
warm

94.64 --> 101.84
it's really surprisingly warm

98.0 --> 101.84
very strange weather

103.6 --> 106.64
especially the warm part is very

105.6 --> 111.119
surprising

106.64 --> 111.119
since there's just not coming any light

112.84 --> 115.84
through

118.479 --> 123.84
right also in general

121.68 --> 128.16
the mood in the netherlands is probably

123.84 --> 131.75900000000001
a little down

128.16 --> 131.759
overall very quiet out there

136.16 --> 143.84
ah sue hello

145.2 --> 154.16
yeah so it's

148.72 --> 154.16
monday the 28th of june 2021

154.84 --> 160.879
yeah yeah

157.84 --> 166.0
so the netherlands lost

160.879 --> 169.35999999999999
a europe cup he dropped out yesterday

166.0 --> 172.959
it was like a huge bomber moment

169.36 --> 176.48000000000002
and ironically or synchronistically

172.959 --> 180.159
i don't know man it like it was

176.48 --> 180.959
like right as we were losing like as it

180.159 --> 183.92
became

180.959 --> 186.8
like really sure and the demoralization

183.92 --> 189.67999999999998
basically started to seep in

186.8 --> 190.72
it literally started to rain really hard

189.68 --> 194.15900000000002
here

190.72 --> 194.159
it's like come on

194.4 --> 200.72
really even at the studios

198.56 --> 202.239
they're like yeah just started raining

200.72 --> 206.56
really hard here this is

202.239 --> 206.56
how difficult yeah it is very typical

208.4 --> 213.84
hello good servant first in chat good to

210.64 --> 213.83999999999997
see you

216.54 --> 219.67999999999998
[Music]

224.84 --> 227.84
right

229.44 --> 234.159
but uh yeah

235.519 --> 242.159
it's i don't know man it's all aftermath

239.04 --> 243.28
stuff hey dutch people are very good at

242.159 --> 245.599
that but

243.28 --> 248.879
i just really got the feeling like yeah

245.599 --> 248.879
we got screwed over

249.599 --> 254.72
in some way i thought actually the

252.959 --> 257.599
referee was

254.72 --> 257.599
kind of terrible

260.479 --> 265.75899999999996
like it stood out to me that he was

262.88 --> 265.759
inconsistent

265.919 --> 271.68
right there's nothing worse than a

268.0 --> 271.68
referee that is inconsistent

272.4 --> 277.28
and it's pure feeling wise right because

274.479 --> 280.88
i am not like a detailed rule

277.28 --> 283.44
expert but i definitely know

280.88 --> 284.71999999999997
that any referee once they decide to set

283.44 --> 288.24
the tone

284.72 --> 289.52000000000004
on how to respond to infractors of

288.24 --> 291.6
players

289.52 --> 292.56
that they have to stay consistent and

291.6 --> 296.32000000000005
this guy

292.56 --> 299.52
did not

296.32 --> 300.08
and totally screwed over us yeah our

299.52 --> 303.44
side

300.08 --> 305.919
blatantly anyway

303.44 --> 307.84
because i thought that like the whole

305.919 --> 312.24
hand situation

307.84 --> 312.23999999999995
it was blatantly an accident right

313.12 --> 317.039
he already knew like the situation was

315.199 --> 319.28000000000003
kind of lost so

317.039 --> 319.28
it

322.08 --> 326.4
it was just terrible and the poor guy

325.919 --> 330.4
man

326.4 --> 331.35999999999996
like he well he took the blame on

330.4 --> 336.08
himself

331.36 --> 339.44
that guy is awesome but like seriously

336.08 --> 342.479
anyway this is

339.44 --> 343.759
so everybody's bummed out about that in

342.479 --> 349.44
football world

343.759 --> 349.44
over here uh hey agm

350.08 --> 353.84
hello rob h

357.52 --> 367.84
yeah thanks for the email the other day

370.16 --> 374.72
yeah i actually brought it up as a

371.759 --> 377.36
subject two days ago

374.72 --> 380.639
it's a really good video i said two days

377.36 --> 380.639
ago three days ago i don't know

383.039 --> 387.759
so yeah i'm pretty much open to talk

385.44 --> 389.84
about any subject

387.759 --> 392.40000000000003
before this i was watching quantum of

389.84 --> 392.4
conscious

393.44 --> 398.08
a video about why space

398.16 --> 402.08000000000004
why do they keep perpetuating it

405.84 --> 410.63899999999995
but yeah it was typical quantum of

408.88 --> 412.96
conscious

410.639 --> 415.12
reasonable but eventually i got kind of

412.96 --> 419.039
tired of it it's like yeah

415.12 --> 419.039
just it's like

419.84 --> 424.479
i'm not getting a real solid point out

422.08 --> 424.479
of this

425.199 --> 430.319
anyway might be my mood

428.79 --> 433.44
[Music]

430.319 --> 435.84000000000003
no but i i'm not too demoralized because

433.44 --> 437.759
you know dutch football this [Â __Â ] always

435.84 --> 441.84
happens to us

437.759 --> 445.52000000000004
like we only ever won just a few

441.84 --> 448.31899999999996
games like since the start so

445.52 --> 449.75899999999996
and we all the entire country just falls

448.319 --> 450.88
in love with it and it's like yeah we're

449.759 --> 452.56
gonna wait we're gonna win and then

450.88 --> 454.08
suddenly like real something really

452.56 --> 457.12
shitty happens like this and it's like

454.08 --> 457.12
ah come on man

459.759 --> 465.84000000000003
i'll be all right because i know to

462.72 --> 465.84000000000003
expect it

467.599 --> 471.84
i remember what was it like roughly 10

469.68 --> 473.52
years ago or 12 years ago

471.84 --> 476.4
it was a game like that too and they

473.52 --> 480.0
made it further and then i was like

476.4 --> 483.039
really bummed out by it

480.0 --> 483.039
now i know better

483.28 --> 486.87899999999996
but on the other hand they're still

484.879 --> 488.47900000000004
going to be the world championships next

486.879 --> 494.08000000000004
year

488.479 --> 498.24
and i think with the proper tinkering

494.08 --> 500.31899999999996
and figuring it out

498.24 --> 502.08
i think they could make it still

500.319 --> 507.84000000000003
extremely far

502.08 --> 507.84
next time anyway

511.84 --> 521.8389999999999
okay all right hm okay see you later

515.12 --> 521.839
then i guess

540.72 --> 549.839
hey tom parker good to see you

556.0 --> 563.839
all right anyway yeah guys talk about

559.36 --> 563.839
whatever i know it's monday

572.24 --> 577.279
oh wait yeah uh yeah i did watch that

575.6 --> 581.12
movie

577.279 --> 583.12
was recommended to me yesterday infinite

581.12 --> 585.839
and i thought that thing was pretty

583.12 --> 585.839
remarkable

587.76 --> 594.72
like i also thought that like the entire

591.519 --> 597.76
concept of it

594.72 --> 605.44
was really worked out well

597.76 --> 609.76
it was very clever

605.44 --> 613.6800000000001
anyway it resonates a lot with how i

609.76 --> 618.72
have sized up the spirit of things

613.68 --> 622.079
so it's almost like it's a

618.72 --> 625.6800000000001
it's a partially metaphorical expression

622.079 --> 625.68
of something that is kind of real

627.519 --> 631.519
i thought it was also fascinating that

629.279 --> 635.76
they would suggest that

631.519 --> 639.04
some would remember their past lives

635.76 --> 642.24
quicker than others and then

639.04 --> 645.76
it's very interesting

642.24 --> 650.72
the idea i've had i thought i've

645.76 --> 650.72
i have thought i thought to have had

651.2 --> 656.399
sort of similar experiences a long time

654.079 --> 656.399
ago

656.959 --> 660.7199999999999
because it does feel like you're

658.839 --> 663.36
suddenly

660.72 --> 665.279
yeah when a lot of consciousness hit you

663.36 --> 665.76
it really does feel like you're suddenly

665.279 --> 668.88
being

665.76 --> 671.279
pulled out and you almost become

668.88 --> 673.92
something else

671.279 --> 676.079
something that's natural but that's

673.92 --> 679.4399999999999
different

676.079 --> 681.8389999999999
it yeah it just it did fascinate me

679.44 --> 684.0790000000001
and i thought also in the movie the

681.839 --> 687.2790000000001
protagonist

684.079 --> 690.4799999999999
like really expressed the

687.279 --> 693.519
the mania the motivation behind

690.48 --> 696.64
why he does what he does very well like

693.519 --> 698.88
the way he explained it yeah

696.64 --> 700.8
that's literally somebody locked into a

698.88 --> 702.88
nightmare no wonder he wants to end the

700.8 --> 706.7199999999999
world right

702.88 --> 710.399
i thought that was pretty well expressed

706.72 --> 714.839
scary too although yeah the the

710.399 --> 717.12
ultimate mcguffin thing was yeah that's

714.839 --> 719.44
ridiculous

717.12 --> 721.68
nobody it's all so weird because it's

719.44 --> 724.24
like even unclear like did somebody make

721.68 --> 724.2399999999999
that thing

724.399 --> 730.0
i think they mentioned it like once

728.0 --> 731.44
they made it then they killed all the

730.0 --> 734.959
scientists or something but

731.44 --> 736.48
uh like who's gonna make something like

734.959 --> 738.56
that you got to be completely out of

736.48 --> 742.16
your mind

738.56 --> 744.079
it's like yeah beyond mad scientist but

742.16 --> 747.519
so that part is a little bit mcguffin

744.079 --> 751.04
but yeah it it kind of drives

747.519 --> 754.5600000000001
the motivations of the the group

751.04 --> 754.56
of the groups so

755.44 --> 759.839
i thought it was a good movie i really

770.839 --> 776.399
did

772.079 --> 776.399
hey seeking star water good to see you

779.44 --> 784.32
gaining wisdom nice

784.839 --> 789.12
right

787.519 --> 792.16
so yeah that was pretty much it for my

789.12 --> 792.16
activity yesterday

799.68 --> 803.68
didn't go to bed too late i had plenty

801.92 --> 806.24
rest

803.68 --> 806.7199999999999
it was weird night though because it was

806.24 --> 810.399
already

806.72 --> 813.12
very hot and moist

810.399 --> 814.399
in the night and there was a lot of

813.12 --> 817.36
mosquitoes

814.399 --> 829.839
i think i like killed like six of them

817.36 --> 829.839
they were all coming for me

840.839 --> 846.32
huh interesting seeking star wars

844.24 --> 849.519
interesting poetics

846.32 --> 849.519
right so yeah guys

852.399 --> 857.839
what have you all been up to

869.76 --> 877.76
all right yeah did anybody catch uh

873.04 --> 877.76
adam meekin's new channel premiere

878.079 --> 885.8389999999999
i was there in chat

896.72 --> 913.839
hey neil liu

924.839 --> 927.839
um

931.68 --> 935.12
you were listening but got interrupted

933.92 --> 941.8389999999999
what

935.12 --> 941.839
listening what

954.639 --> 958.8
painting rusty iron railing i thought

958.24 --> 962.72
you said

958.8 --> 962.7199999999999
nails uh railings okay

963.92 --> 969.8389999999999
anti-rust paste paint

967.04 --> 969.8389999999999
i take it

981.44 --> 986.8000000000001
what kind of railings you mean like for

984.32 --> 986.8000000000001
curtains

986.88 --> 990.56
why don't you just get new ones

993.36 --> 997.839
i mean if they're like rusting

1007.04 --> 1010.8
yeah seeking style water yeah but global

1009.199 --> 1014.079
of course they will do that because it's

1010.8 --> 1019.68
all about the circumdeculars geometry

1014.079 --> 1019.68
right it's very logical from their

1022.839 --> 1025.839
perspective

1031.199 --> 1039.8390000000002
steps to back door oh okay

1040.959 --> 1047.3600000000001
right yeah you don't want to

1044.0 --> 1050.0
have rusty staircases like tripping one

1047.36 --> 1053.52
time and you're [Â __Â ]

1050.0 --> 1055.76
and what we want rust wounds is terrible

1053.52 --> 1055.76
uh

1059.6 --> 1063.4399999999998
not too bad okay okay i was just

1061.679 --> 1065.44
thinking like if it's a really small

1063.44 --> 1067.44
thing then why would you

1065.44 --> 1068.72
not just replace it that should be cheap

1067.44 --> 1072.0
but if it's like not

1068.72 --> 1073.679
not a curtain rail but actually from a

1072.0 --> 1075.6
staircase yeah that's

1073.679 --> 1081.8400000000001
a little bit more complicated and

1075.6 --> 1081.84
expensive so i get it

1092.84 --> 1095.84
hmm

1106.84 --> 1109.84
um

1116.32 --> 1123.12
right so i'm a little low on input today

1119.6 --> 1126.6399999999999
so just the atmosphere

1123.12 --> 1128.6399999999999
morally so unless somebody's gonna

1126.64 --> 1132.3200000000002
really

1128.64 --> 1135.8400000000001
inspire me with some subject

1132.32 --> 1140.0
i'm not really gonna give a lot

1135.84 --> 1141.1899999999998
speech is here what's adam's channel

1140.0 --> 1144.219
called

1141.19 --> 1144.219
[Music]

1147.2 --> 1154.72
what is the world

1151.52 --> 1154.72
you have to fly with the north

1155.679 --> 1158.72
alright here's the link

1160.64 --> 1165.8400000000001
that's actually a link to the video but

1162.4 --> 1165.8400000000001
you can subscribe there

1190.84 --> 1197.039
you

1193.28 --> 1199.84
yeah adam did some great intro

1197.039 --> 1199.84
detail work

1204.24 --> 1208.159
and outro too by the way so yeah it was

1206.88 --> 1221.8400000000001
pretty cool

1208.159 --> 1221.8400000000001
very adam

1246.84 --> 1249.84
hmm

1274.84 --> 1277.84
sick

1297.2 --> 1301.44
right so this whole thing is a bit

1299.039 --> 1304.8799999999999
redundant but

1301.44 --> 1307.28
just bumped into this

1304.88 --> 1307.2800000000002
it's like

1314.559 --> 1319.84
not something i'd normally bring up

1321.52 --> 1326.559
whoa what the

1330.48 --> 1349.919
what the hell holy [Â __Â ] okay i got a

1346.64 --> 1349.919
whole bunch of paypals

1350.0 --> 1358.72
yeah and uh steve you can have your

1354.0 --> 1361.6
490 back i will not be

1358.72 --> 1364.159
religiously bribed like some kind of

1361.6 --> 1364.1589999999999
catholic

1369.05 --> 1372.18
[Music]

1373.2 --> 1379.8400000000001
did i see london yesterday oh your god

1376.64 --> 1389.8400000000001
no i didn't sleeping warrior i did i

1379.84 --> 1389.84
why would i have seen london yesterday

1391.2 --> 1394.0800000000002
i don't live there

1394.4 --> 1397.6000000000001
right so yeah

1399.76 --> 1406.96
good servant if you wanna actually

1403.2 --> 1409.6000000000001
genuinely donate to me i don't

1406.96 --> 1412.0
take condition conditional donations

1409.6 --> 1412.0
like that

1412.559 --> 1417.84
i'm appalled that you would even try

1414.84 --> 1417.84
that

1423.84 --> 1429.039
also mark smiler for some reason now

1426.799 --> 1430.1589999999999
actually donated a whole bunch of money

1429.039 --> 1433.6
to me

1430.159 --> 1439.279
i guess he's now paying me to read

1433.6 --> 1439.279
his endless waffling about freaking

1442.84 --> 1445.84
magnets

1446.88 --> 1449.44
the [Â __Â ]

1450.32 --> 1453.6
it doesn't seem to understand that i

1453.12 --> 1458.8799999999999
have

1453.6 --> 1461.76
magnets toothache will stop and

1458.88 --> 1473.8400000000001
the [Â __Â ] dude right well he doesn't seem

1461.76 --> 1473.84
to be giving me any condition

1480.88 --> 1486.0
so yeah at least that one i can just

1484.84 --> 1489.6
take

1486.0 --> 1492.159
no refunds right because hey if he just

1489.6 --> 1495.279
wants to send me some story

1492.159 --> 1495.279
give me advice

1495.36 --> 1502.1589999999999
and then donate with that that's fine

1498.799 --> 1503.84
as long as he doesn't expect that i'm

1502.159 --> 1505.6000000000001
actually gonna give him some kind of

1503.84 --> 1507.84
representation of his story

1505.6 --> 1507.84
right

1509.36 --> 1515.76
definitely not gonna like

1512.64 --> 1517.5200000000002
if you accept this money then you have

1515.76 --> 1522.0
to believe this and that

1517.52 --> 1525.039
right good servant don't do that again

1522.0 --> 1525.039
that's insulting

1526.84 --> 1529.84
uh

1533.36 --> 1536.6399999999999
oh okay there was a big protest in

1535.679 --> 1539.279
london

1536.64 --> 1543.8400000000001
i guess sleeping warrior yeah i hadn't

1539.279 --> 1543.84
taken any notice of that

1552.559 --> 1560.1589999999999
right anyway yeah mark's mark smilier

1556.64 --> 1561.1200000000001
magnet man i thank you very much for the

1560.159 --> 1564.4
donation

1561.12 --> 1564.3999999999999
i can really use that

1566.48 --> 1571.52
i'm not going to become like somebody

1569.44 --> 1572.3200000000002
that's going to be wearing magnets all

1571.52 --> 1574.72
the time

1572.32 --> 1578.1589999999999
alright i have magnets i've already

1574.72 --> 1580.559
shown i have magnets

1578.159 --> 1585.8400000000001
i don't particularly like to wear them

1580.559 --> 1585.84
on my person

1589.12 --> 1599.84
but i do not underestimate the effects

1592.0 --> 1599.84
of magnets right

1600.559 --> 1606.559
need a new battery in your smoke or

1603.84 --> 1607.1999999999998
co too what the hell are you talking

1606.559 --> 1610.0
about with

1607.2 --> 1610.0
george sanford

1610.88 --> 1613.8400000000001
uh

1619.76 --> 1627.84
do magnets make everything except what

1622.24 --> 1627.84
kind of a question is that

1634.559 --> 1639.6789999999999
that beep now that's just a really

1637.679 --> 1642.3990000000001
annoying

1639.679 --> 1644.159
like teenager magpie that won't grow up

1642.399 --> 1646.559
is constantly whining

1644.159 --> 1648.159
for their grown-up par for their parent

1646.559 --> 1651.6
which is

1648.159 --> 1653.44
like he then the animal is pretty much

1651.6 --> 1655.12
as big

1653.44 --> 1657.2
as their parent and they're just

1655.12 --> 1660.6399999999999
constantly whining for food

1657.2 --> 1664.0800000000002
like constantly it's really annoying

1660.64 --> 1664.0800000000002
especially for the parent

1666.399 --> 1671.76
if that's what you're hearing there's

1669.2 --> 1674.0800000000002
plenty of bird activity over here

1671.76 --> 1674.08
okay

1674.799 --> 1683.84
put out some bread too

1684.399 --> 1689.12
just aimed at it okay it marks my lear

1692.64 --> 1698.3990000000001
i don't know he's supposedly around on

1694.96 --> 1698.3990000000001
youtube i think

1700.24 --> 1703.6
it could be that i have banned him here

1702.08 --> 1706.72
in chat because he gets

1703.6 --> 1708.7199999999998
really weird and very spammy

1706.72 --> 1710.32
like literally just he has a very bad

1708.72 --> 1713.52
habit of copy pasting

1710.32 --> 1716.399
really large pages of text

1713.52 --> 1716.399
terrible habit

1718.88 --> 1725.8400000000001
a style in 80 12. yeah i'm doing fine

1729.679 --> 1739.8400000000001
thanks for asking how are you

1758.81 --> 1761.9299999999998
[Music]

1764.84 --> 1767.84
cool

1770.67 --> 1773.749
[Music]

1811.919 --> 1816.3200000000002
right but anyway yeah tony sleeping

1813.84 --> 1818.72
warrior mark smiler wasn't

1816.32 --> 1819.76
talking about magnets doing things in

1818.72 --> 1823.1200000000001
physics

1819.76 --> 1823.84
and all that he's purely referring to

1823.12 --> 1827.12
them as

1823.84 --> 1828.6399999999999
some kind of healing device and he's

1827.12 --> 1831.9189999999999
kind of obsessed with it

1828.64 --> 1834.8400000000001
has been for some time i don't know

1831.919 --> 1839.6000000000001
maybe it does a lot of good for him

1834.84 --> 1839.6
right just that

1839.679 --> 1854.3200000000002
doesn't work as well for everybody

1851.44 --> 1856.88
but yeah he's treating it like okay you

1854.32 --> 1859.279
you use magnets all your problems go so

1856.88 --> 1861.679
go away that's basically what it is

1859.279 --> 1863.519
constantly keeps trying to suggest over

1861.679 --> 1868.0800000000002
the years

1863.519 --> 1868.08
and yeah it's just no

1868.32 --> 1876.84
do gemstone work what

1872.559 --> 1879.6789999999999
do they work no they're actually

1876.84 --> 1882.559
inanimate the gemstone

1879.679 --> 1883.2
is inanimate it doesn't do any work it

1882.559 --> 1886.48
just

1883.2 --> 1886.48
well sits there

1886.64 --> 1893.8400000000001
you know

1904.84 --> 1909.9189999999999
so

1907.76 --> 1912.08
unless you of course weren't referring

1909.919 --> 1915.919
to physical labor

1912.08 --> 1919.12
probably not right

1915.919 --> 1921.039
gemstones yeah sure they can work right

1919.12 --> 1924.4799999999998
there's a whole thing

1921.039 --> 1925.44
i've been part of just healing stones

1924.48 --> 1928.48
but it all has to

1925.44 --> 1930.0
it's it's not a physical thing it's a

1928.48 --> 1933.3600000000001
spirit thing

1930.0 --> 1938.399
it is a purely spiritual thing

1933.36 --> 1938.399
is barely anything to do with the flesh

1940.48 --> 1945.44
so yeah been to stores where they have

1943.36 --> 1947.1999999999998
the all these types of gemstones and

1945.44 --> 1949.6000000000001
minerals

1947.2 --> 1950.64
and they would be yeah kind of well new

1949.6 --> 1953.12
ageish

1950.64 --> 1954.7990000000002
with it but they were very good at it

1953.12 --> 1957.279
they were very sensitive

1954.799 --> 1958.8799999999999
and i yeah i did get a whole bunch of

1957.279 --> 1962.24
different types of stones that i had

1958.88 --> 1965.0390000000002
used in times where i felt

1962.24 --> 1966.3990000000001
i was weakened or had issues and then

1965.039 --> 1970.08
get certain stones

1966.399 --> 1971.84
that would suggest to help with those

1970.08 --> 1973.84
issues mostly like emotional

1971.84 --> 1977.039
psychological

1973.84 --> 1978.8799999999999
instinctual etc etc or purely

1977.039 --> 1982.0
electromagnetic

1978.88 --> 1985.2
right for example

1982.0 --> 1985.2
these stones

1986.559 --> 1993.519
black tourmaline right

1990.0 --> 1995.96
are distinctly mentioned

1993.519 --> 1998.0
as to help against forms of

1995.96 --> 2000.3990000000001
electromagnetic disturbance

1998.0 --> 2002.08
which typically accompany electronic

2000.399 --> 2005.36
devices

2002.08 --> 2010.08
especially those that

2005.36 --> 2011.84
yeah use a lot of electricity

2010.08 --> 2013.4399999999998
right so that's one of the things that i

2011.84 --> 2017.6
got out of like

2013.44 --> 2019.919
gemstones for healing just one example

2017.6 --> 2021.279
very familiar example a lot of people

2019.919 --> 2026.24
that are into stones will

2021.279 --> 2029.2
know about this but

2026.24 --> 2030.88
yeah it's all about the spirit and you

2029.2 --> 2031.519
have to train your spirit to just be

2030.88 --> 2035.679
pure

2031.519 --> 2039.039
and like some

2035.679 --> 2040.799
druids or people that are really into

2039.039 --> 2043.12
herbs and wild herbs

2040.799 --> 2045.12
they'll just use your in their intuition

2043.12 --> 2048.879
to pick the right thing for the right

2045.12 --> 2050.399
moment so can you do the same thing with

2048.879 --> 2052.7999999999997
using gems

2050.399 --> 2053.52
but there's also plenty of people that i

2052.8 --> 2056.0
come across

2053.52 --> 2056.72
that do that that just get lost in the

2056.0 --> 2059.919
stones

2056.72 --> 2060.3199999999997
like they use it to only think about

2059.919 --> 2063.359
that

2060.32 --> 2065.52
and then basically neglect

2063.359 --> 2066.48
their surroundings or other people

2065.52 --> 2068.8
that's also

2066.48 --> 2071.599
something that's happened that i've seen

2068.8 --> 2074.8
right i've seen all kinds

2071.599 --> 2077.9190000000003
so getting gemstones doesn't

2074.8 --> 2082.32
fix your entire life just to

2077.919 --> 2082.3199999999997
get that misconception out of the way

2082.48 --> 2085.599
but it can assist

2086.96 --> 2090.399
mainly because of the focus

2098.079 --> 2103.28
data storage in future will be in class

2100.64 --> 2108.24
that's ridiculous

2103.28 --> 2112.2400000000002
glass really why glass

2108.24 --> 2115.52
i mean if it was in crystal i'd get it

2112.24 --> 2117.5989999999997
because crystal isn't liquid

2115.52 --> 2119.92
glass is technically a liquid how the

2117.599 --> 2122.7200000000003
hell could you stably store

2119.92 --> 2122.7200000000003
anything in that

2128.96 --> 2134.64
i mean in sci-fi movies for

2132.24 --> 2135.5989999999997
data crystal storage yeah sure they'll

2134.64 --> 2139.1189999999997
use glass

2135.599 --> 2142.96
props but you can't

2139.119 --> 2145.04
in my humble inside

2142.96 --> 2146.96
i don't think you can use the glass for

2145.04 --> 2148.56
like data coding storage because

2146.96 --> 2151.28
it's liquid it's going to

2148.56 --> 2154.88
[Music]

2151.28 --> 2158.7200000000003
doesn't work it's very

2154.88 --> 2161.839
slightly fluid

2158.72 --> 2164.8799999999997
so same as

2161.839 --> 2169.599
water stores info

2164.88 --> 2169.92
yeah but you can't use a body of water

2169.599 --> 2173.04
for

2169.92 --> 2175.119
data storage either george

2173.04 --> 2176.24
that's a different type of storage

2175.119 --> 2179.44
that's more like

2176.24 --> 2183.4399999999996
frequencies it's more uniform data

2179.44 --> 2185.92
is data that means a whole bunch of

2183.44 --> 2187.92
effectively ones and zeros like a

2185.92 --> 2191.839
complicated irregular

2187.92 --> 2195.92
pattern of it that's data right

2191.839 --> 2197.7599999999998
now an energy field or a certain like a

2195.92 --> 2199.92
mood

2197.76 --> 2201.5200000000004
those are like uniform fields they have

2199.92 --> 2203.839
an overall frequency

2201.52 --> 2205.68
uniform influence right that's very

2203.839 --> 2208.88
different from data storage

2205.68 --> 2208.8799999999997
very very different

2213.839 --> 2219.68
yeah i'm not gonna play it though but

2216.72 --> 2221.359
i'll take a look at it

2219.68 --> 2223.5989999999997
and other people could take a look at it

2221.359 --> 2223.5989999999997
too

2225.28 --> 2234.2400000000002
ravers oh having a big party

2230.88 --> 2238.8
oh damn that's crowded

2234.24 --> 2243.839
yo you weren't kidding tony holy [Â __Â ]

2238.8 --> 2243.8390000000004
that's a lot of people

2267.44 --> 2285.839
went to that arc encounter what does

2271.44 --> 2285.839
that mean neil

2294.54 --> 2297.579
[Music]

2301.76 --> 2307.28
all right yeah well you know what i

2304.56 --> 2313.2
think i can show

2307.28 --> 2315.6800000000003
just a very short clip of it

2313.2 --> 2317.2
just to give a sight on how many

2315.68 --> 2320.3999999999996
freaking people there were

2317.2 --> 2320.3999999999996
it is pretty amazing

2322.24 --> 2327.839
let's see

2332.32 --> 2334.88
all right

2335.359 --> 2341.839
okay let's

2345.119 --> 2349.28
oh right it's already showing uh

2350.96 --> 2369.839
i'm not doing sound but man just look

2354.72 --> 2369.839

2448.16 --> 2453.839
yeah there was no party over here

2456.88 --> 2464.1600000000003
oh man i'm gonna look around

2460.88 --> 2466.48
do after i'm gonna do groceries today

2464.16 --> 2468.8799999999997
because like there was so much orange

2466.48 --> 2471.119
[Â __Â ] everywhere

2468.88 --> 2472.88
and now i'm wondering like how many

2471.119 --> 2474.0
people have already like in a hurry

2472.88 --> 2476.2400000000002
taking it away

2474.0 --> 2480.24
because it's like oh no don't want to be

2476.24 --> 2482.72
reminded about how we lost

2480.24 --> 2483.68
so i wonder like what's still hanging

2482.72 --> 2495.839
and what is just

2483.68 --> 2495.839
completely gone

2500.93 --> 2504.1299999999997
[Music]

2523.2 --> 2529.04
really stranded that that's complete

2526.48 --> 2529.04
[Â __Â ]

2529.92 --> 2536.7200000000003
wow is this like a sean hawkins sock

2534.96 --> 2539.92
because that is one of the dumbest

2536.72 --> 2539.9199999999996
things i've ever heard

2540.72 --> 2543.359
google it

2548.48 --> 2551.839
it makes no freaking sense

2559.28 --> 2565.8390000000004
mike fox um good point

2562.48 --> 2565.839
it's just that this is so dumb

2569.599 --> 2574.88
yeah you need a map uh

2572.8 --> 2576.2400000000002
i don't think they got stranded because

2574.88 --> 2579.52
they didn't have a map because

2576.24 --> 2582.24
you don't need a map just people use

2579.52 --> 2582.24
gps

2585.44 --> 2588.48
right and it's not because of satellites

2588.079 --> 2591.8390000000004
just

2588.48 --> 2594.319
just because of towers so it's totally

2591.839 --> 2597.839
pointless

2594.319 --> 2601.04
they didn't go with a map i'm so

2597.839 --> 2604.4
funny i'm so smart

2601.04 --> 2606.16
like the mediterranean sea is a really

2604.4 --> 2608.4
small sea

2606.16 --> 2610.56
you don't even need a complete map you

2608.4 --> 2611.2000000000003
don't even necessarily need to know the

2610.56 --> 2614.319
freaking

2611.2 --> 2621.839
orientation of anything because it's

2614.319 --> 2621.839
like a very enclosed sea

2622.88 --> 2627.599
yeah dumb that's right it's really dumb

2627.839 --> 2632.72
dumb to think that it makes some kind of

2632.839 --> 2635.839
point

2638.8 --> 2642.4
but i am wondering though like oh these

2640.88 --> 2644.319
are floors

2642.4 --> 2646.1600000000003
what would they what what were they

2644.319 --> 2649.839
actually doing there

2646.16 --> 2649.839
they're like trying to find

2649.92 --> 2654.319
maybe some thing on the ocean floor or

2653.359 --> 2663.839
something

2654.319 --> 2663.839
what were they even doing there

2667.76 --> 2674.1600000000003
dude that makes no sense

2671.839 --> 2677.839
makes no sense what you're saying makes

2674.16 --> 2677.839
no sense

2679.2 --> 2686.16
what people out there are gonna

2682.64 --> 2687.359
explore a lake go sailing on the lake or

2686.16 --> 2690.96
in a

2687.359 --> 2694.4
small sea and need a

2690.96 --> 2697.52
map really really so

2694.4 --> 2700.48
how about just freaking gps

2697.52 --> 2703.68
on your computer screen right it just

2700.48 --> 2706.8
makes no sense dude this is so dumb

2703.68 --> 2710.0
everything you say is really stupid

2706.8 --> 2710.0
apollo nasa it's

2713.52 --> 2716.839
it's not causing any trouble stallion 80

2715.92 --> 2719.92
12 it's

2716.839 --> 2722.16
just dumb it's like

2719.92 --> 2723.28
he thinks he's trolling no he's just

2722.16 --> 2726.7999999999997
saying things that are

2723.28 --> 2729.119
really [Â __Â ] dumb to think

2726.8 --> 2731.52
that that makes some kind of a point or

2729.119 --> 2735.6800000000003
put somebody in a bad light no it's a

2731.52 --> 2738.4
really really poorly put together

2735.68 --> 2740.8799999999997
superficial story without a point and

2738.4 --> 2742.7200000000003
any logical consistency with how things

2740.88 --> 2746.56
actually go in reality

2742.72 --> 2750.319
so it's just dumb

2746.56 --> 2753.7599999999998
gp has gps has not met

2750.319 --> 2755.7599999999998
yeah no [Â __Â ] it has a map

2753.76 --> 2757.2000000000003
but that's not even really relevant it

2755.76 --> 2759.76
just

2757.2 --> 2761.5989999999997
basically tells you where you are

2759.76 --> 2762.96
supposedly

2761.599 --> 2765.839
and on something like that the

2762.96 --> 2768.8
mediterranean sea which is very much

2765.839 --> 2769.2
defined the locations there's not going

2768.8 --> 2771.76
to be

2769.2 --> 2773.1189999999997
any deviations that gps is going to

2771.76 --> 2775.599
insert

2773.119 --> 2776.4
if there were any right like on the

2775.599 --> 2779.28
southern

2776.4 --> 2779.28
hemisphere

2779.52 --> 2783.599
this is in the northern part

2781.68 --> 2788.24
mediterranean sea it's just everything

2783.599 --> 2790.079
you say is dumb

2788.24 --> 2792.9599999999996
so are you saying they went on a boat

2790.079 --> 2796.7200000000003
and they didn't even bring a mobile

2792.96 --> 2796.7200000000003
really nothing

2797.68 --> 2803.839
are are you sure they weren't just like

2800.839 --> 2803.839
fishermen

2804.319 --> 2808.96
local fishermen that just drifted off

2807.2 --> 2810.7999999999997
got lost on sea because that's been

2808.96 --> 2812.7200000000003
happening for a long time

2810.8 --> 2814.079
right they got services for that just

2812.72 --> 2816.24
like what is this

2814.079 --> 2820.48
what are you talking about this is like

2816.24 --> 2820.4799999999996
the most nonsensical stupid little

2820.96 --> 2826.319
[Â __Â ] i'm i'm confused

2824.56 --> 2831.839
why you thought that it would make some

2826.319 --> 2831.839
kind of a point

2837.2 --> 2847.52
yeah i know

2845.76 --> 2850.559
i know sleeping warrior that's why this

2847.52 --> 2853.92
makes it's it's just dumb

2850.559 --> 2854.48
like dude save it for your stupid little

2853.92 --> 2857.119
book

2854.48 --> 2859.359
or whatever you would want to write

2857.119 --> 2859.92
because as an actual point an actual

2859.359 --> 2862.72
argument

2859.92 --> 2863.52
in this moment it makes no sense it just

2862.72 --> 2866.48
makes you look

2863.52 --> 2873.839
really ill-informed and stupid to say

2866.48 --> 2873.839
anything like that

2879.76 --> 2887.8390000000004
now that's this is very sneaky of you

2882.64 --> 2887.839
sleeping warrior but

2889.28 --> 2896.1600000000003
gps doesn't need to be run by satellites

2893.04 --> 2902.319
just requires a hub of antennas

2896.16 --> 2915.839
and so maybe a couple of zeppelin

2902.319 --> 2915.839
relays here and there possible

2918.319 --> 2925.68
no gps sailing is the thing oh really

2921.92 --> 2925.6800000000003
so is that like people's hobby then

2926.96 --> 2930.8
are they doing it for the adventure

2940.079 --> 2944.1600000000003
okay at is time i'm just gonna ban you

2942.96 --> 2948.0
hi

2944.16 --> 2948.0
stop wasting my time with your stupid

2954.839 --> 2957.839
[Â __Â ]

2958.079 --> 2961.76
no i was there sooner than that

2963.359 --> 2967.2
yeah that's the problem you know it's

2965.68 --> 2971.839
it's really easy to

2967.2 --> 2971.839
take down a troll it's just that

2973.44 --> 2978.88
this is like in games you know you have

2976.24 --> 2982.24
those monsters the ones that always

2978.88 --> 2983.52
they're everywhere but like they take

2982.24 --> 2985.7599999999998
more effort

2983.52 --> 2987.44
than it's actually worth like the drop

2985.76 --> 2989.599
that they give and and that's

2987.44 --> 2992.64
usually the case and this guy too you

2989.599 --> 2996.4
know he made me talk about it for like

2992.64 --> 2997.1189999999997
five minutes and during that whole time

2996.4 --> 3000.0
there wasn't

2997.119 --> 3002.1600000000003
one little detail of interesting

3000.0 --> 3004.48
information coming from them

3002.16 --> 3005.839
i had to all do it myself i had to all

3004.48 --> 3008.4
fill it in

3005.839 --> 3010.4
so yeah he wasted my time like a stupid

3008.4 --> 3014.96
little creature that just yields

3010.4 --> 3017.359
no loot no xp it's really stupid

3014.96 --> 3018.079
and i feel kinda stupid for having taken

3017.359 --> 3019.839
the bait

3018.079 --> 3022.079
and wasted five minutes on the other

3019.839 --> 3027.839
hand yeah

3022.079 --> 3027.8390000000004
better than a silent moment

3028.559 --> 3031.76
shout out to sean hawkins shout out

3030.559 --> 3034.1600000000003
retracted

3031.76 --> 3034.1600000000003
tony

3036.24 --> 3041.839
hey nathan oakley

3052.839 --> 3055.839
so

3078.319 --> 3084.64
99 sure it was my you might be on to

3081.28 --> 3086.6400000000003
something you got a good point terret

3084.64 --> 3089.5989999999997
you're a bit younger than me and you you

3086.64 --> 3089.5989999999997
seem to be able to

3090.16 --> 3096.8799999999997
determinate from the way they write

3094.0 --> 3098.079
a little better you seem to distinguish

3096.88 --> 3101.76
a little better among

3098.079 --> 3101.76
trolls than i do

3104.48 --> 3108.079
so i think you might be right i'm just

3107.52 --> 3110.0
calling

3108.079 --> 3111.52
i just call him sean hawkins or

3110.0 --> 3114.96
something because of

3111.52 --> 3117.68
going at john hawkins yesterday in chat

3114.96 --> 3118.16
he was like extra noisy and annoying and

3117.68 --> 3124.0
he wouldn't

3118.16 --> 3126.319
shut up for like half an hour

3124.0 --> 3127.68
doing what shawn does like just

3126.319 --> 3130.88
completely

3127.68 --> 3132.319
waste everybody's time

3130.88 --> 3134.1600000000003
it's constantly saying oh you're not

3132.319 --> 3136.8
doing this you're not doing that oh i've

3134.16 --> 3141.5989999999997
disproven everything you're recovering

3136.8 --> 3141.599
just endless garbage

3143.119 --> 3147.76
but i i felt like proving to him at that

3146.16 --> 3150.7999999999997
time like yeah

3147.76 --> 3153.2000000000003
i'm not gonna ban you because it's

3150.8 --> 3154.2400000000002
so useless what you do it's better to

3153.2 --> 3157.1189999999997
just leave you

3154.24 --> 3159.5989999999997
out to do your thing as an example to

3157.119 --> 3163.839
people what happens

3159.599 --> 3165.599
you know just to remind them like oh oh

3163.839 --> 3166.0789999999997
you think you can go up against flat

3165.599 --> 3169.119
earth

3166.079 --> 3171.119
well look at that guy that guy thought

3169.119 --> 3172.4
he could go up against flat earth and

3171.119 --> 3176.2400000000002
he's still doing it

3172.4 --> 3179.599
right so you could be sean hawkins

3176.24 --> 3181.52
yeah i think that's a much more

3179.599 --> 3182.96
functional way to deal with somebody

3181.52 --> 3185.92
like that

3182.96 --> 3188.2400000000002
because what better deterrent from

3185.92 --> 3192.4
becoming a glober than a life

3188.24 --> 3195.5989999999997
sean hawkins example of his behavior

3192.4 --> 3198.96
you know because who wants to become

3195.599 --> 3198.96
sean hawkins sheesh

3205.2 --> 3209.52
paid to shield for the globe you really

3207.76 --> 3211.44
think's a sleeping warrior or you think

3209.52 --> 3211.92
he just doesn't have any life and he

3211.44 --> 3215.92
doesn't

3211.92 --> 3219.6800000000003
he wants to be accepted by

3215.92 --> 3221.839
pieces of [Â __Â ] that have self-claimed

3219.68 --> 3224.0789999999997
virtual authority through their body of

3221.839 --> 3227.2
knowledge which is all [Â __Â ]

3224.079 --> 3227.2000000000003
but people believe it

3227.28 --> 3230.8
i don't think he's smart enough to

3229.119 --> 3234.0
actually get paid to chill

3230.8 --> 3236.48
like he he couldn't do that in his mind

3234.0 --> 3236.88
he probably still is too honorable for

3236.48 --> 3239.119
that

3236.88 --> 3242.0
even though everything he does disproves

3239.119 --> 3243.76
that he has any sense of honor

3242.0 --> 3245.359
he's a complete hypocrite about it but

3243.76 --> 3246.88
you still think it

3245.359 --> 3248.7999999999997
i don't think he would chill i think

3246.88 --> 3265.119
he's just a really

3248.8 --> 3269.04
stupid and really obsessed

3265.119 --> 3272.2400000000002
job for me okay but if you're gonna say

3269.04 --> 3276.16
shield that that kind of directly

3272.24 --> 3278.9599999999996
implies that there is money

3276.16 --> 3279.5989999999997
as a direct motivation for the action

3278.96 --> 3281.68
right

3279.599 --> 3284.079
i don't think sean's getting money for

3281.68 --> 3285.839
his [Â __Â ] show performance

3284.079 --> 3287.3590000000004
i don't think he's getting anything from

3285.839 --> 3290.4
that i think he

3287.359 --> 3294.72
he wants to probably he might have like

3290.4 --> 3298.4
gotten like some pity money

3294.72 --> 3301.04
from some bigger scumbags out there

3298.4 --> 3301.76
maybe you know but other than that i

3301.04 --> 3303.839
don't think he

3301.76 --> 3305.599
like has an active contract to do what

3303.839 --> 3308.64
he does it's like who's gonna pay a

3305.599 --> 3310.799
[Â __Â ] like that like nobody

3308.64 --> 3312.0789999999997
like because look he's gonna do it

3310.799 --> 3315.04
anyway

3312.079 --> 3315.04
because he has no life

3316.16 --> 3321.839
and everybody knows it

3330.88 --> 3337.359
no sleeping right no no no no

3334.0 --> 3339.839
he doesn't get out of bed for for shows

3337.359 --> 3341.92
no no it's with john hawkins it's just

3339.839 --> 3343.68
he wakes up he starts raging like an

3341.92 --> 3345.359
idiot and then he goes and trolls

3343.68 --> 3346.8799999999997
whatever's present

3345.359 --> 3348.48
and if there's nothing live he's gonna

3346.88 --> 3351.2000000000003
write shitty comments

3348.48 --> 3352.96
you know that's what he does it doesn't

3351.2 --> 3356.3999999999996
he's not dedicated to time

3352.96 --> 3359.52
slots right another sign that he's not

3356.4 --> 3362.559
being actively paid under contract

3359.52 --> 3364.96
now he's just as stupid obsessed

3362.559 --> 3364.96
zealot

3374.88 --> 3379.52
i get out of bed for effie literally

3383.2 --> 3387.359
dude if i didn't have this show i i

3385.44 --> 3390.4
could my sleeping pattern could be

3387.359 --> 3392.319
all over the place it used to be like i

3390.4 --> 3393.2000000000003
had times where i would get up at like

3392.319 --> 3395.7599999999998
four o'clock

3393.2 --> 3398.0
and in the afternoon crazy i don't

3395.76 --> 3400.079
recommend it it's not very healthy

3398.0 --> 3401.359
not for your spirit either but i would i

3400.079 --> 3404.0
could

3401.359 --> 3405.2799999999997
i had times where i had like a 27 hour

3404.0 --> 3407.839
rhythm

3405.28 --> 3409.119
for a month now that's freaking weird

3407.839 --> 3412.0
that can't happen

3409.119 --> 3412.0
because i have a show

3414.319 --> 3419.7599999999998
so i do actually get out of bed for a

3416.96 --> 3422.88
flat earth unlike sean hawkins who just

3419.76 --> 3426.48
randomly wakes up and starts raging with

3422.88 --> 3426.48
whatever is present at the time

3430.88 --> 3436.1600000000003
yeah dedicated deluded guy that there's

3434.16 --> 3438.3999999999996
another word for that sleeping word it's

3436.16 --> 3438.3999999999996
called

3444.839 --> 3447.839
obsessed

3453.92 --> 3457.2000000000003
ah look at me

3457.359 --> 3463.7599999999998
trying to pick out people who are

3461.68 --> 3465.2799999999997
in a much worse position in life than

3463.76 --> 3468.88
myself

3465.28 --> 3471.119
especially physically and spiritually

3468.88 --> 3473.359
just so i can't forget about that we

3471.119 --> 3474.33
freaking lost in the euro

3473.359 --> 3479.0
damn it

3474.33 --> 3479.0
[Laughter]

3480.96 --> 3489.839
don't worry it's not gonna hang around

3484.16 --> 3489.839
tomorrow it'll be like just move on

3490.16 --> 3493.68
all right but sometimes when you feel

3491.92 --> 3495.119
kind of demoralized it is good to

3493.68 --> 3497.2799999999997
basically just

3495.119 --> 3500.079
be a little bit petty and just point it

3497.28 --> 3503.6800000000003
like oh my god look at that idiot

3500.079 --> 3507.119
he's in an even worse position than me

3503.68 --> 3509.2799999999997
you know it's petty

3507.119 --> 3511.359
but it is kind of natural just don't

3509.28 --> 3514.6400000000003
overdo it

3511.359 --> 3519.119
and realize that that is

3514.64 --> 3521.68
like a mechanism it's natural

3519.119 --> 3523.359
just don't get obsessed right it's all

3521.68 --> 3525.7599999999998
about don't get obsessed

3523.359 --> 3526.5589999999997
things are natural until you get

3525.76 --> 3529.599
obsessed

3526.559 --> 3532.96
and then they become unnatural right

3529.599 --> 3537.3590000000004
now that thing that i just said

3532.96 --> 3540.48
is actually so solid and strong

3537.359 --> 3541.04
i would say jesus could have said it i

3540.48 --> 3543.68
don't me

3541.04 --> 3544.24
maybe he did maybe some of you out there

3543.68 --> 3546.8799999999997
actually

3544.24 --> 3548.64
know like a specific thing that he said

3546.88 --> 3551.6800000000003
that he did say this

3548.64 --> 3553.359
maybe in slightly different wording but

3551.68 --> 3555.44
it is true though

3553.359 --> 3556.48
you know it is true and when you think

3555.44 --> 3558.799
about it and you cross

3556.48 --> 3561.2
reference it with everything all

3558.799 --> 3564.4
behavior it's always true

3561.2 --> 3568.48
things are pretty much natural until

3564.4 --> 3568.48
obsession starts to slip in

3569.839 --> 3575.92
right you know when that happens

3573.119 --> 3577.2000000000003
intuitively with people you can feel it

3575.92 --> 3580.96
off them it's like

3577.2 --> 3583.2
obsession is like a attention

3580.96 --> 3585.599
field that is created and then

3583.2 --> 3586.0
maintained like a defensive mode almost

3585.599 --> 3589.839
and it

3586.0 --> 3593.2
always drives you astray

3589.839 --> 3595.2799999999997
always does obsessions because if it

3593.2 --> 3597.1189999999997
didn't then it wouldn't be an obsession

3595.28 --> 3600.4
you wouldn't be

3597.119 --> 3603.2000000000003
letting some focus something

3600.4 --> 3604.799
drive you to places that you we in a

3603.2 --> 3607.359
sensible state of mind wouldn't

3604.799 --> 3610.16
allow yourself to go right that's what

3607.359 --> 3610.16
obsession does

3610.24 --> 3615.2799999999997
and there's always like a feeling that

3612.559 --> 3616.7200000000003
comes off somebody that is in obsession

3615.28 --> 3618.4
with something

3616.72 --> 3621.04
it's a palpable thing it's like an

3618.4 --> 3621.04
energy thing

3626.079 --> 3629.8390000000004
so yeah if somebody knows a

3631.04 --> 3636.64
a quote from jesus christ in the bible

3634.319 --> 3639.44
where he described

3636.64 --> 3641.2
obsession versus natural behavior that

3639.44 --> 3643.839
would be really cool

3641.2 --> 3647.2799999999997
i don't know for sure if if he did

3643.839 --> 3650.48
mention anything about such things

3647.28 --> 3657.8390000000004
or maybe partially or indirectly

3650.48 --> 3657.839
i don't know the bible well enough

3668.48 --> 3671.839
hey jim do you know anything

3685.2 --> 3688.48
oh yeah sleeping warrior did you see

3687.52 --> 3690.96
that

3688.48 --> 3693.04
that chat conversation i had with sean

3690.96 --> 3695.599
hawkins yesterday because that's exactly

3693.04 --> 3695.599
what i did

3696.96 --> 3700.2400000000002
because i just moved on question to

3699.68 --> 3702.5589999999997
question

3700.24 --> 3704.8799999999997
and it ended up like okay so you think

3702.559 --> 3708.2400000000002
gravity keeps the gas to the ball

3704.88 --> 3709.52
how is it doing that and then he's just

3708.24 --> 3711.359
said he just

3709.52 --> 3714.0
said like it pushes it it's like oh

3711.359 --> 3717.52
really but how can you push

3714.0 --> 3717.52
on something without a force

3717.68 --> 3721.7599999999998
and then he said he literally said tony

3720.88 --> 3726.0
listen to this

3721.76 --> 3727.8390000000004
he said that you

3726.0 --> 3729.28
this sean hawkins said this in chat

3727.839 --> 3733.599
yesterday he said that

3729.28 --> 3735.6800000000003
you made up that gravity is not a force

3733.599 --> 3737.2000000000003
and that it's not written anywhere so i

3735.68 --> 3740.24
started to say okay but what about

3737.2 --> 3743.2799999999997
all the

3740.24 --> 3746.64
physics university libraries

3743.28 --> 3749.92
all the endless quotes and like

3746.64 --> 3752.96
what they teach and he just started

3749.92 --> 3753.6800000000003
yelling and saying no it's you all made

3752.96 --> 3757.359
it up that's

3753.68 --> 3768.96
like a cover that we made up he went all

3757.359 --> 3772.0
over there sean hawkins right

3768.96 --> 3774.7200000000003
uh i don't know sleeping warrior if i'm

3772.0 --> 3774.72
gonna do that

3774.88 --> 3783.839
get the feeling there's a really bad

3776.799 --> 3783.839
joke in there

3808.839 --> 3814.4
oh

3810.72 --> 3814.3999999999996
oh all right

3817.359 --> 3820.96
that's not what i thought you were gonna

3819.039 --> 3824.7200000000003
post but yeah that's perfectly fine

3820.96 --> 3840.2400000000002
to show uh

3824.72 --> 3840.24
hold on right

3853.76 --> 3857.92
good stuff and true

3859.599 --> 3866.2400000000002
it's really hard to wrap their head

3861.039 --> 3881.8390000000004
around it though from ballers

3866.24 --> 3881.839
thanks for that tony

3883.68 --> 3890.319
kill brick revealed the flat earth

3887.599 --> 3891.76
flat earth in opening c yeah terra 306

3890.319 --> 3894.88
he probably showed the disc

3891.76 --> 3898.3190000000004
right because have any of you

3894.88 --> 3901.52
ever seen a revealing

3898.319 --> 3906.0
of the flat earth

3901.52 --> 3906.0
in any other form than the disc

3906.839 --> 3912.96
anybody

3909.599 --> 3914.4
no you haven't have you you always get

3912.96 --> 3917.44
to see the disc

3914.4 --> 3919.92
does that mean it's secretly

3917.44 --> 3919.92
true

3920.72 --> 3923.839
does it

3926.4 --> 3930.559
seems like a really smart trick to kind

3928.88 --> 3936.2400000000002
of

3930.559 --> 3938.88
push through a an occulted conviction

3936.24 --> 3940.24
keeping it a secret and then showing you

3938.88 --> 3943.52
flashes of like

3940.24 --> 3946.8799999999997
what the hidden truth is

3943.52 --> 3949.2
so how do you then know that they even

3946.88 --> 3953.28
know it's the truth

3949.2 --> 3956.319
huh how do you know

3953.28 --> 3956.3190000000004
that they would know

3957.76 --> 3960.7990000000004
how how would you know that they would

3959.68 --> 3964.3999999999996
know that that

3960.799 --> 3967.599
model the disc that they show

3964.4 --> 3968.2400000000002
that they know it's that how would you

3967.599 --> 3971.2000000000003
know

3968.24 --> 3971.2
that they would know

3972.96 --> 3979.839
if you really thought about that

4018.559 --> 4024.4
hezbollah above so below image

4021.92 --> 4025.119
what what do you mean with that george

4024.4 --> 4035.839
sanford

4025.119 --> 4035.839
i don't know what that image is

4069.599 --> 4072.0
okay

4074.079 --> 4078.799
flat earth inside a ball sure

4088.64 --> 4093.52
so you think that that is the real

4091.76 --> 4095.5200000000004
representation of the earth george

4093.52 --> 4098.4
sanford do you

4095.52 --> 4098.4
do you think that

4100.159 --> 4105.3589999999995
because as far as as i'm concerned

4102.319 --> 4105.359
that's a disc

4107.52 --> 4114.719
could be okay right so no

4111.199 --> 4114.719
you don't know yeah

4117.6 --> 4121.839
that was my point that was my point it's

4120.319 --> 4125.679
like oh oh they drop

4121.839 --> 4128.88
like flat earth disc hints

4125.679 --> 4133.839
in movies and back to the future and

4128.88 --> 4133.839
just say it was

4136.0 --> 4140.159
in the kubrick movie clockwork orange

4138.319 --> 4142.64
you know in all kinds of good movies

4140.159 --> 4146.159
right so they put it in there

4142.64 --> 4147.1990000000005
so that means they know it's a disk does

4146.159 --> 4148.5599999999995
it

4147.199 --> 4151.44
because that's what a lot of people

4148.56 --> 4152.4800000000005
think right they think oh my god they

4151.44 --> 4155.2789999999995
put it in where

4152.48 --> 4157.2789999999995
i never saw it before and then they just

4155.279 --> 4161.359
immediately

4157.279 --> 4164.159000000001
take conclusions into it into infinity

4161.359 --> 4165.679
and say okay so that means they know it

4164.159 --> 4168.799
is a disk

4165.679 --> 4175.839
it means the earth is disk right

4168.799 --> 4175.839
people do that

4178.4 --> 4189.839
i try not to do that

4200.0 --> 4207.04
concave and flat that's

4203.159 --> 4207.04
self-contradicting george sanford

4211.44 --> 4218.08
it's flat or it's concave it can't be

4214.64 --> 4221.6
flat and concave not in a literal

4218.08 --> 4221.6
geometrical reality

4227.679 --> 4231.84
hello julio pavan good to see you

4239.46 --> 4245.84
[Music]

4241.36 --> 4245.839999999999
and tiny wumble doing great

4247.36 --> 4253.759999999999
i kept all those two right so yeah

4251.36 --> 4255.92
so the surface of the earth is not

4253.76 --> 4259.2390000000005
concave

4255.92 --> 4260.4
that's the suggestion is that the

4259.239 --> 4263.759999999999
container

4260.4 --> 4267.12
is spherical and there is a flat

4263.76 --> 4270.88
disc in the dead middle

4267.12 --> 4272.08
center of the spherical container why

4270.88 --> 4275.1990000000005
can't you just say

4272.08 --> 4278.32
it why don't you just say it

4275.199 --> 4281.04
describe it in a technical literal sense

4278.32 --> 4281.04
as what it is

4285.28 --> 4292.32
it's not hollow with a concave and

4288.64 --> 4292.320000000001
flat airda no

4294.8 --> 4305.6
couldn't have said it worse

4301.12 --> 4305.599999999999
up turned edges really

4312.32 --> 4318.4
that makes no sense so

4315.679 --> 4320.719
upturned edges how does that work you go

4318.4 --> 4321.839999999999
you go on to the upturned edges and you

4320.719 --> 4324.88
literally

4321.84 --> 4327.6
your gyroscope just starts to turn

4324.88 --> 4331.36
as you suddenly go up a hill even though

4327.6 --> 4331.360000000001
you're technically going straight ahead

4340.84 --> 4346.719
right

4342.239 --> 4349.04
can you post a link to a phenomenon

4346.719 --> 4349.04
okay

4354.84 --> 4358.32
sure go ahead

4369.04 --> 4373.92
facebook uh i can't i can't even check

4371.679 --> 4373.92
that

4382.84 --> 4386.159000000001
dude

4384.32 --> 4388.239
oh and the link you put on the flat

4386.159 --> 4391.199
earth early bird chat just says you're

4388.239 --> 4394.639999999999
temporarily blocked so

4391.199 --> 4399.839999999999
uh i don't know i can't check that sorry

4394.64 --> 4399.84
hello gary with manga good to see you

4403.84 --> 4407.92
so yeah george sanford i'd like to see

4405.679 --> 4409.76
about you know every time somebody says

4407.92 --> 4412.8
upturned edges

4409.76 --> 4414.0
so is that literal or is it like an

4412.8 --> 4417.679
optical thing

4414.0 --> 4420.8
right remember when dr picard

4417.679 --> 4421.28
went up into his high altitude balloon

4420.8 --> 4424.0
with the

4421.28 --> 4425.599999999999
floor lens watching down he described

4424.0 --> 4428.8
upturned edges too

4425.6 --> 4430.08
does that mean it's literally upturned

4428.8 --> 4435.04
edges

4430.08 --> 4435.04
or is it just an optical effect

4452.84 --> 4455.84
foreign

4471.04 --> 4474.8
the highest elevation recorder

4472.56 --> 4478.2390000000005
supposedly on antarctica

4474.8 --> 4478.2390000000005
really how

4478.88 --> 4482.159000000001
and if it me if that means that it is

4481.44 --> 4485.28
like a

4482.159 --> 4489.12
mountain range at

4485.28 --> 4492.639999999999
the edge of the presumed disc uh

4489.12 --> 4495.5199999999995
how is that upturned edges

4492.64 --> 4496.0
like you can just walk off that mountain

4495.52 --> 4499.6
and then

4496.0 --> 4502.159
suddenly start walking diagonally

4499.6 --> 4502.88
or is it just oh it's filled up with

4502.159 --> 4506.239
mountain

4502.88 --> 4509.04
how does that make it literal like the

4506.239 --> 4509.5199999999995
surface orientation how does that make

4509.04 --> 4512.159
it have

4509.52 --> 4516.64
upturned edges it makes no sense

4512.159 --> 4516.639999999999
literally makes no sense to say it like

4522.84 --> 4525.84
that

4528.0 --> 4534.48
it's not a surface orientation edge it's

4531.28 --> 4537.44
just stuff there in this case

4534.48 --> 4537.44
mountain range

4537.6 --> 4542.88
that's not an upturn edge that's called

4539.92 --> 4542.88
a mountain range

4546.48 --> 4553.04
right there's no ocean or ice

4550.0 --> 4555.36
that's literally just like oh going up

4553.04 --> 4557.76
there and suddenly it's all diagonal

4555.36 --> 4559.12
and you can walk up there diagonally no

4557.76 --> 4563.1990000000005
that's not happening

4559.12 --> 4565.679
right so why call it an upturn

4563.199 --> 4567.919999999999
edge right we're talking about the

4565.679 --> 4571.679
surface the geometrical surface

4567.92 --> 4571.679
orientation of the earth realm

4578.84 --> 4581.84
right

4592.84 --> 4595.84
so

4598.8 --> 4609.84
yeah don't get in here with those names

4603.28 --> 4609.84
i'm not even gonna read your sentences

4632.239 --> 4637.5199999999995
so is anybody actually gonna respond to

4634.96 --> 4640.64
what i say

4637.52 --> 4643.52
how does that make a giant high

4640.64 --> 4645.04
mountain range assumed to be there an

4643.52 --> 4648.719
upturned edge

4645.04 --> 4650.96
of the geometric surface of earth

4648.719 --> 4652.56
are you walking are you able to walk

4650.96 --> 4655.679
diagonally

4652.56 --> 4659.120000000001
up that mountain range

4655.679 --> 4661.04
can i can i have a response please

4659.12 --> 4665.84
can i have some recognition of what i'm

4661.04 --> 4665.84
talking about

4707.76 --> 4710.88
i mean do you want me to call you out by

4710.4 --> 4714.08
name

4710.88 --> 4715.36
in my chat one by one before i finally

4714.08 --> 4717.92
get a response

4715.36 --> 4719.36
are you all like doing the dishes or

4717.92 --> 4720.2390000000005
something and you can't touch your

4719.36 --> 4725.04
computer

4720.239 --> 4725.04
why is nobody freaking responding

4730.48 --> 4734.5599999999995
can you please stop doing your chores

4732.719 --> 4738.08
for a second and actually

4734.56 --> 4738.080000000001
interact in the chat

4743.28 --> 4748.4
yeah stop it oh so you weren't even

4746.64 --> 4763.84
listening well then you don't need to

4748.4 --> 4763.839999999999
get involved tony

4767.76 --> 4775.679
the question is if you're gonna suggest

4771.92 --> 4779.28
that there is an up turned edge

4775.679 --> 4781.84
at the edge of the disc earth

4779.28 --> 4783.84
which is assumed to be flat in whatever

4781.84 --> 4786.88
setup

4783.84 --> 4790.56
why would you call it up turning edge

4786.88 --> 4793.76
if you can't physically literally

4790.56 --> 4795.4400000000005
walk diagonally up that edge what would

4793.76 --> 4799.4400000000005
it have to do

4795.44 --> 4802.799999999999
with the surface orientation

4799.44 --> 4806.08
that's what i said and everybody

4802.8 --> 4807.6
just shut the [Â __Â ] up didn't say [Â __Â ]

4806.08 --> 4809.12
for five minutes even though i've

4807.6 --> 4811.92
repeated it for like four

4809.12 --> 4814.32
times are you all sleeping or something

4811.92 --> 4814.32
hello

4816.84 --> 4819.84
hello

4826.32 --> 4833.5199999999995
so why do you call it upturn edges

4830.0 --> 4834.639
why why is that an upturned edge

4833.52 --> 4836.96
what does that have to do with the

4834.639 --> 4839.76
surface orientation it's

4836.96 --> 4841.76
just a obstruction it has nothing to do

4839.76 --> 4844.4800000000005
with the surface orientation

4841.76 --> 4845.280000000001
unless you have some kind of a clue that

4844.48 --> 4848.48
you can walk

4845.28 --> 4849.679
diagonally upon the upturn edge

4848.48 --> 4852.0
right and then there's the

4849.679 --> 4854.719
cross-reference with dr picard who

4852.0 --> 4855.679
described visually an upturned edge of

4854.719 --> 4859.12
the disk

4855.679 --> 4861.84
whatever he saw too bad he didn't

4859.12 --> 4864.08
actually film it

4861.84 --> 4864.08
so

4869.52 --> 4874.080000000001
oh really upturned edges can keep water

4871.92 --> 4874.08
in

4874.239 --> 4880.08
how if it literally has to do with the

4877.8 --> 4882.159000000001
orientation of the earth's surface then

4880.08 --> 4885.04
how is it going to keep anything in

4882.159 --> 4886.799999999999
because anything will just move on to

4885.04 --> 4889.12
the upturned edges because

4886.8 --> 4891.4400000000005
it is part of the surface orientation

4889.12 --> 4891.44
right

4894.239 --> 4897.678999999999
well it's not an upturned edge and you

4896.48 --> 4901.5199999999995
shouldn't be calling it an

4897.679 --> 4904.639
upturned edge it's just an obstruction

4901.52 --> 4907.280000000001
it's just a mountain range

4904.639 --> 4908.4800000000005
there is no surface orientation

4907.28 --> 4912.639
alteration

4908.48 --> 4915.759999999999
in that upturn edge region

4912.639 --> 4919.04
because it's not an upturn edge if

4915.76 --> 4919.04
there even is such a thing

4920.08 --> 4923.28
you know i don't even freaking think

4921.92 --> 4924.88
it's a disc man

4923.28 --> 4931.84
there's no evidence for this no

4924.88 --> 4931.84
conclusive evidence to me

4950.56 --> 4959.360000000001
grendel we were talking about the

4952.08 --> 4963.12
surface orientation

4959.36 --> 4964.48
of earth right surface orientation of

4963.12 --> 4966.8
earth

4964.48 --> 4968.08
it's claimed apparently there's upturned

4966.8 --> 4972.400000000001
edges

4968.08 --> 4977.199
so the up turn would be part

4972.4 --> 4980.48
of the surface orientation

4977.199 --> 4983.919999999999
which basically implies

4980.48 --> 4984.799999999999
relative density direction or formerly

4983.92 --> 4987.92
known as

4984.8 --> 4990.56
thought of as gravity right

4987.92 --> 4991.679
we're talking about surface orientation

4990.56 --> 4994.719
right

4991.679 --> 4997.76
right not just

4994.719 --> 5000.4
a description of like oh

4997.76 --> 5001.04
something that could be like a like a

5000.4 --> 5003.199
cup

5001.04 --> 5004.88
or something now we're talking about the

5003.199 --> 5015.199
surface orientation

5004.88 --> 5017.4400000000005
right are we

5015.199 --> 5018.239
otherwise you could just as well just

5017.44 --> 5020.5599999999995
say what

5018.239 --> 5022.0
upturn edges just say no the earth is a

5020.56 --> 5026.56
freaking petri dish

5022.0 --> 5029.84
like literally that and it would be

5026.56 --> 5031.76
more metaphorically accurate right

5029.84 --> 5035.28
because you're not suggesting that the

5031.76 --> 5038.4800000000005
surface orientation the relative density

5035.28 --> 5042.08
axis is going to alter

5038.48 --> 5055.929999999999
when you approach these so named

5042.08 --> 5059.1
upturned edges right

5055.93 --> 5059.1
[Music]

5075.199 --> 5085.839999999999
all right so nothing then just nothing

5096.84 --> 5099.84
uh

5111.44 --> 5119.919999999999
all right yeah tony i agree with you

5116.48 --> 5121.599999999999
it cannot be an in it can be in it no

5119.92 --> 5122.2390000000005
there cannot be an infinite plane i

5121.6 --> 5125.120000000001
disagree

5122.239 --> 5126.0
what you don't think it is it can't be

5125.12 --> 5128.719
an infinite plane

5126.0 --> 5130.0
there is no infinity in physical reality

5128.719 --> 5133.04
that's

5130.0 --> 5138.0
logically con inconsistent

5133.04 --> 5155.84
there can't be can be no infinite volume

5138.0 --> 5155.84
no infinite energy no infinite material

5180.32 --> 5184.48
so did anybody even understand what i

5183.679 --> 5186.56
said

5184.48 --> 5188.5599999999995
when i talked about the upturned edges

5186.56 --> 5189.92
issue i got a little agitated and

5188.56 --> 5193.76
everybody seems to be

5189.92 --> 5196.52
ignoring me like that's gonna make it go

5193.76 --> 5199.6
away even though i specifically

5196.52 --> 5202.88
demanded people in chat

5199.6 --> 5206.400000000001
to address what i

5202.88 --> 5211.84
said and you are

5206.4 --> 5211.839999999999
all now pissing me off for slacking

5218.159 --> 5222.799999999999
yeah you're not ignoring me you're just

5220.56 --> 5225.04
red herring me onto another subject and

5222.8 --> 5229.28
that's just fine it's not

5225.04 --> 5229.28
not just talking to you toady

5230.88 --> 5235.6
yeah demands that's right this is a

5234.159 --> 5238.239
check

5235.6 --> 5238.96
it's part of the show i don't like

5238.239 --> 5242.4
people

5238.96 --> 5242.4
wasting my time in there

5243.76 --> 5247.84
everybody has high energy moments low

5246.32 --> 5252.719
energy moments

5247.84 --> 5257.52
but just like in school i demand

5252.719 --> 5257.52
response i do

5261.04 --> 5267.84
was a perception only right ah

5264.159 --> 5272.4
gave you my answer to get my hands

5267.84 --> 5272.400000000001
what i didn't see that

5279.12 --> 5282.48
wait what to find out

5289.04 --> 5296.0
solution to these questions variable

5292.639 --> 5299.679
doable solution to this ques

5296.0 --> 5299.679
what i don't need a solution

5300.88 --> 5308.400000000001
i just need some recognition

5303.92 --> 5311.76
as to the situation that i described

5308.4 --> 5313.44
the issue of calling it an upturned edge

5311.76 --> 5317.04
when we're talking about the freaking

5313.44 --> 5320.48
surface orientation of earth

5317.04 --> 5320.48
do you understand that that's

5320.84 --> 5323.84
problematic

5332.08 --> 5335.5199999999995
right and yeah the idea is fantastic

5334.4 --> 5338.08
would be pretty cool

5335.52 --> 5339.679
like oh yeah flat whatever and then

5338.08 --> 5341.5199999999995
weird wobbly

5339.679 --> 5343.28
[Â __Â ] starts to happen and suddenly

5341.52 --> 5346.0
you're walking on the wall

5343.28 --> 5348.08
right yeah that's fantastical to imagine

5346.0 --> 5351.44
it's really cool

5348.08 --> 5355.6
well is that the claim

5351.44 --> 5359.199
up turn edges right up turn edges

5355.6 --> 5361.4400000000005
you're just gonna walk on the side is

5359.199 --> 5362.638999999999
is that the claim when somebody says

5361.44 --> 5366.08
upturn edges

5362.639 --> 5369.12
or does it have nothing to do with an

5366.08 --> 5369.12
upturned edge

5369.52 --> 5373.6
it's just an obstruction

5374.0 --> 5380.719
there is no reorientation

5377.6 --> 5383.52
of the relative density axis

5380.719 --> 5385.52
is that what it actually is or does it

5383.52 --> 5387.84
even refer to anything

5385.52 --> 5389.76
physical it just purely optical like

5387.84 --> 5393.1990000000005
tony said and has to

5389.76 --> 5407.84
do with what pick up professor picard

5393.199 --> 5407.839999999999
saw in his balloon

5413.52 --> 5421.84
wow okay this is not going anywhere

5417.679 --> 5421.84
i'm calling it for today

5426.4 --> 5431.199
thanks everyone for coming i hope you

5428.48 --> 5431.199
liked this show

5431.84 --> 5435.52
would have been great there was a little

5433.52 --> 5438.56
bit more interaction

5435.52 --> 5440.4800000000005
uh if you still did then please don't

5438.56 --> 5442.320000000001
forget to rogan's it up and if you

5440.48 --> 5443.678999999999
haven't already subscribe to my channel

5442.32 --> 5445.679

5443.679 --> 5447.6
so you know when i'm going live which is

5445.679 --> 5449.679
normally 1 p.m amsterdam time in the

5447.6 --> 5450.4800000000005
weekdays and 2pm amsterdam time in the

5449.679 --> 5452.4800000000005
weekend

5450.48 --> 5454.638999999999
and please also do support me through

5452.48 --> 5456.879999999999
the paypal patreon crypto wallet super

5454.639 --> 5460.0
chat and membership system join button

5456.88 --> 5462.0
that would be much appreciated

5460.0 --> 5465.36
i will be back tomorrow flat earth early

5462.0 --> 5468.48
bird number 939 on a tuesday

5465.36 --> 5470.799999999999
i'm gonna join the flat earth debates

5468.48 --> 5472.48
just start up in about 15 minutes from

5470.8 --> 5474.08
now

5472.48 --> 5476.32
already open the panel so i'm just going

5474.08 --> 5478.0
to join early

5476.32 --> 5479.92
i don't know how active i'm gonna be i'm

5478.0 --> 5481.04
also gonna get groceries somewhere in in

5479.92 --> 5484.56
between there so

5481.04 --> 5486.719
uh okay well thanks

5484.56 --> 5488.96
gaining wisdom i'm glad you like the

5486.719 --> 5490.2390000000005
show i'm not too sure what i thought

5488.96 --> 5493.199
about it

5490.239 --> 5495.199
i got really agitated i still kind of am

5493.199 --> 5496.719
like i feel a bit disappointed in you

5495.199 --> 5500.48
guys

5496.719 --> 5502.8
right it's not just about

5500.48 --> 5502.799999999999
like

5504.159 --> 5508.879999999999
it i'm trying to challenge you

5511.44 --> 5517.28
and i feel there seems to be some

5514.639 --> 5518.719
slowing down i don't know i don't like i

5517.28 --> 5520.639
don't like that i don't want that to

5518.719 --> 5524.4800000000005
become a trend i want you all to

5520.639 --> 5527.04
really actually listen

5524.48 --> 5529.678999999999
not just oh it's nice and soothing to

5527.04 --> 5531.92
hear arwyn's voice in the background

5529.679 --> 5533.1990000000005
although i can't barely barely imagine

5531.92 --> 5535.52
you'd think that

5533.199 --> 5536.638999999999
but that's me i don't really like my own

5535.52 --> 5539.92
voice all that much

5536.639 --> 5540.96
i don't think it's terrible but but i'd

5539.92 --> 5545.4400000000005
rather hope you'd

5540.96 --> 5547.679
actually listen to what i say

5545.44 --> 5550.0
and then think about it and see if it

5547.679 --> 5553.6
connects and if it doesn't

5550.0 --> 5557.44
that you get back to me and ask me

5553.6 --> 5560.8
for clarification even though

5557.44 --> 5562.96
it might be an ethereal thing

5560.8 --> 5564.400000000001
maybe that makes you feel a little

5562.96 --> 5568.32
uncomfortable

5564.4 --> 5571.759999999999
asking something ethereal like that

5568.32 --> 5575.199
still do it as long as you just stay

5571.76 --> 5578.2390000000005
serious when you do it don't start to

5575.199 --> 5581.599999999999
joke with it if you're actually

5578.239 --> 5584.0
in need of clarification right

5581.6 --> 5586.08
so i would really appreciate if there

5584.0 --> 5587.6
was a little bit more interactivity with

5586.08 --> 5589.76
my chat

5587.6 --> 5591.84
because i know you all have it in you

5589.76 --> 5597.12
most of you

5591.84 --> 5597.12
please bring it alright so anyway

5597.199 --> 5603.839999999999
uh until the next video

5600.48 --> 5603.839999999999
keep it flat

5604.31 --> 5627.079000000001
[Music]

5628.84 --> 5635.47
so

5630.69 --> 5635.469999999999
[Music]

5656.56 --> 5658.639
you
