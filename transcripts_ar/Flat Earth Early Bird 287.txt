5.029 --> 12.870000000000001
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

9.15 --> 15.839
early-bird number 287 I'm your host

12.87 --> 18.18
Arwen and before we start the show if

15.839 --> 20.85
that's actually gonna happen for some

18.18 --> 24.93
reason YouTube which it's not going live

20.85 --> 29.64
despite what we are saying that I'm

24.93 --> 31.41
gonna finally write so please don't

29.64 --> 33.149
forget to share the show and on any

31.41 --> 34.559
platform you deem fit and also if you

33.149 --> 36.39
haven't already subscribed to my channel

34.559 --> 38.489
hit the bell notification so you know

36.39 --> 41.370000000000005
when I'm going live which is normally

38.489 --> 43.349999999999994
2:00 p.m. Amsterdam time every day also

41.37 --> 45.51
please support my show through the Super

43.35 --> 49.32
chats PayPal patreon and my GoFundMe

45.51 --> 52.349999999999994
that will be much appreciated today is

49.32 --> 55.44
just so freaking odd it's maybe even

52.35 --> 65.22
worse than yesterday also because it's

55.44 --> 69.29899999999999
just all but wind still and this heat is

65.22 --> 71.85
not doing me any good I can tell you you

69.299 --> 77.22000000000001
probably could tell by the way yesterday

71.85 --> 79.02
show went I'm not really at the top of

77.22 --> 82.17
my game

79.02 --> 82.17
[Music]

84.31 --> 92.06
yeah not something new it's kind of an

89.45 --> 97.43
organic energy drink thingy lemon taste

92.06 --> 102.31
this time it's really nice from the

97.43 --> 112.61000000000001
cooler besides that I got water

102.31 --> 118.179
blueberries tangerine so but despite

112.61 --> 123.19
that heat I am starting to notice the

118.179 --> 127.009
the probiotics are definitely working

123.19 --> 136.64
but the yeah the heats also seems to be

127.009 --> 138.83
playing a role overall so at some point

136.64 --> 141.26
I may just be walking away just to get

138.83 --> 143.06
to the hallway where it's a lot cooler

141.26 --> 145.519
than here and you know what I'm actually

143.06 --> 148.33
gonna open the door because nobody else

145.519 --> 148.33
is home anyway

161.959 --> 167.599
all right so let's see who is in chat I

164.95 --> 172.099
don't know my chat was disconnected for

167.599 --> 176.54
some reason earlier but anyway first off

172.099 --> 176.98899999999998
that I see Steve hm Casey Jones flat

176.54 --> 182.319
soit

176.989 --> 188.06
f e mod mod sir Alice mist Julia Pavan

182.319 --> 189.349
oppa moko brand again Amanda you yeah

188.06 --> 205.489
good to see you all

189.349 --> 210.73899999999998
doc Michael alright so I first off let's

205.489 --> 212.56900000000002
just try to fix the situation where it

210.739 --> 214.70000000000002
ended yesterday because that in

212.569 --> 219.29
retrospect was just so freakin messy

214.7 --> 221.41899999999998
it's just unbelievable I did leave a

219.29 --> 224.269
comment afterwards in the comment

221.419 --> 227.62900000000002
section for those who actually cared

224.269 --> 232.699
about that and yeah it really was a

227.629 --> 238.569
misunderstanding but it just you know

232.699 --> 243.169
what it's like another guy and he just

238.569 --> 248.51
really stepped on my toe badly and he

243.169 --> 252.829
didn't even realize it so and I don't

248.51 --> 255.019
know yesterday was a weird day anyway it

252.829 --> 258.47
was kind of good afterwards I was on

255.019 --> 261.38
with on Jose's and Riley was there and

258.47 --> 264.05
we actually made some more progress it

261.38 --> 265.61
was pretty cool because they had the

264.05 --> 269.449
globe was on the panel there we're kind

265.61 --> 272.81
of trying to force us into math which I

269.449 --> 275.63
love so much you know I don't and I

272.81 --> 277.849
basically did what I do what I am

275.63 --> 279.77
actually good at the way I'm good at

277.849 --> 282.77
math and that is just to figure out

279.77 --> 285.02
what's going on and then tell it so I

282.77 --> 286.49
said okay relative density this equity

285.02 --> 290.12
mean it's a problem for you guys okay

286.49 --> 291.98
it's the differential it's one density

290.12 --> 294.86
against the other one and it's a

291.98 --> 297.8
differential and when you apply that you

294.86 --> 301.82
get numbers and those numbers can be put

297.8 --> 305.389
out in a graph and then you can use this

301.82 --> 308.8
yet that as a relative density model for

305.389 --> 311.479
the whole thing it just Riley did I

308.8 --> 314.99
don't know he did it wasn't even that

311.479 --> 317.15
hard you did the basic math I wasn't

314.99 --> 319.76
more confident added than me I just

317.15 --> 325.31
every time I try to do new math things I

319.76 --> 327.139
just I don't like it it's also one thing

325.31 --> 330.97
that I kind of like about the scientific

327.139 --> 335.36
method because it's not based on math

330.97 --> 337.52000000000004
it's really based on just things and

335.36 --> 340.16
relations and I like that about it

337.52 --> 342.59
that's a good way for me to be able to

340.16 --> 347.75
explain things and to figure things out

342.59 --> 349.92999999999995
so yeah they're ballers of course all

347.75 --> 353.889
proceeded to call it specific gravity

349.93 --> 357.2
because gravity had to burrow its way

353.889 --> 360.08
into the core of the whole thing that it

357.2 --> 362.889
actually is all about and just put that

360.08 --> 366.88
gravity stamp on there one more time

362.889 --> 369.11
just kind of like you see it's gravity

366.88 --> 377.349
skinny's gravity because it's called

369.11 --> 377.349
gravity what the [Â __Â ]

382.57 --> 387.269
great

384.08 --> 387.269
[Music]

387.65 --> 395.65999999999997
freaking buck Latrice just flew in my

392.25 --> 406.8
mouth that's just yuck

395.66 --> 410.63000000000005
wasn't a regular flight thank God anyway

406.8 --> 413.49
I thought it was really good

410.63 --> 416.6
over at Jose's despite the ballers all

413.49 --> 419.79
talking one through one another and I

416.6 --> 422.64000000000004
kind of was able to help out with that

419.79 --> 424.77000000000004
keeping order and they it's funny

422.64 --> 427.08
because they do kind of respect it when

424.77 --> 429.99
I do that because I'm really trying to

427.08 --> 432.99
get order and I'm not politicizing that

429.99 --> 435.99
power and they realized that and it's

432.99 --> 440.52
good so it was kind of fun on house days

435.99 --> 443.64
and then after that yeah there was

440.52 --> 449.49
jaren ISM but I think I missed that I

443.64 --> 452.19
don't know why was I doing anyway I

449.49 --> 455.94
proceeded no yeah no I didn't miss it

452.19 --> 457.95
I did watch it just it wasn't Garin ISM

455.94 --> 462.78
in all those ball busters no it was what

457.95 --> 464.72999999999996
man I'm really confused right here did

462.78 --> 467.48999999999995
German have a thing or not i don't know

464.73 --> 470.04
anyway i remember that at the end of

467.49 --> 473.37
whatever that was randy kind of put out

470.04 --> 478.17
a link no wait it wasn't of course it

473.37 --> 481.05
wasn't it debates after show for him he

478.17 --> 483.06
aired that's what it was that's right it

481.05 --> 484.31
was pretty good as well and I don't know

483.06 --> 490.11
I was there

484.31 --> 494.03000000000003
Randy was there and I guess now that he

490.11 --> 497.88
is kind of trying to be nice to me

494.03 --> 499.97999999999996
it really feels off though it's kind of

497.88 --> 502.98
the same thing that nathan is do it's I

499.98 --> 504.66
don't know I I don't like really being

502.98 --> 507.69
treated like this but I guess they don't

504.66 --> 510.27000000000004
really know what else to do and I'm just

507.69 --> 513.77
gonna take it as they're trying to make

510.27 --> 513.77
peace or something

514.42 --> 520.12
and I'm gonna just have to kind of go

517.48 --> 524.02
with it because after that I was on

520.12 --> 529.39
Randy's channel and he didn't he wasn't

524.02 --> 533.56
a dick to me so yeah I guess yeah it was

529.39 --> 537.34
kind of good Reilly continued with some

533.56 --> 540.16
ballers on ran tease what we were doing

537.34 --> 541.96
at Jose's and it was amusing yet to be

540.16 --> 545.26
there and I had some input and I don't

541.96 --> 548.25
know I guess ranty is kind of done

545.26 --> 550.63
poking me around although I cannot

548.25 --> 553.24
absolutely not trust that it's the end

550.63 --> 557.11
of it because of course it's not the end

553.24 --> 560.77
of it but I guess I'm gonna have to lay

557.11 --> 563.35
down the over sensitivity here from my

560.77 --> 565.63
side I just realized that there's

563.35 --> 566.83
nothing really I can do about it rent is

565.63 --> 570.97
going to be doing what he's going to be

566.83 --> 575.35
doing and I don't know people are gonna

570.97 --> 577.78
let him and well he can certainly at

575.35 --> 581.83
least for a while act like oh really I'm

577.78 --> 583.81
really not bad that bad a guy until of

581.83 --> 587.83
course that all suddenly changes and he

583.81 --> 590.76
becomes a total dick again but I'm just

587.83 --> 594.6700000000001
gonna have to go with it and kind of

590.76 --> 598.06
stop being so oversensitive because it's

594.67 --> 599.89
also just not working I'm lashing out at

598.06 --> 601.92
other people that don't really deserve

599.89 --> 601.92
it

613.95 --> 616.76
right

622.33 --> 630.51
yeah yeah I can tell you why Eco play an

625.54 --> 633.16
anchor it's kind of sick but look I've

630.51 --> 635.65
discussed a lot of more personal things

633.16 --> 641.35
even with him in the background I really

635.65 --> 644.41
showed him who I am as it were as honest

641.35 --> 646.5400000000001
as I can be and he did it kind of in

644.41 --> 648.79
choir to it as well I I did limited

646.54 --> 655.7199999999999
somewhat but he does understand the

648.79 --> 659.11
dilemmas that I deal with and I don't

655.72 --> 662.11
know I think he is kind of like with the

659.11 --> 664.96
attitude like no I don't agree with the

662.11 --> 668.0500000000001
way you see it your path and all that he

664.96 --> 672.58
thinks it's nonsense and he likes to

668.05 --> 675.55
kind of prove that by showing how easily

672.58 --> 679.72
I can be poked by somebody that has

675.55 --> 685.03
absolutely no shame because I cared for

679.72 --> 687.3100000000001
them and yeah it's Luciferian behavior

685.03 --> 692.8299999999999
and he's just wholeheartedly really

687.31 --> 697.3
behind that and it's his choice and he

692.83 --> 701.5200000000001
it has consequences and I just really

697.3 --> 701.52
really hate it when people do that

702.57 --> 705.87
that's all

711.87 --> 717.089
all right

714.46 --> 717.089
but

727.27 --> 732.22
it's is what it is

739.35 --> 744.24
I'm just gonna have to be a lot stronger

760.15 --> 765.55
and also I've got to figure out just

762.66 --> 767.26
what I'm really doing here what a what

765.55 --> 772.0889999999999
I'm trying to achieve with my audience I

767.26 --> 774.88
think that maybe I'm being in a way even

772.089 --> 777.5200000000001
too strict but it's really tough because

774.88 --> 782.38
I am really trying to make so many

777.52 --> 784.3299999999999
points in a very specific structure for

782.38 --> 787.39
for the path I'm trying to show that

784.33 --> 793.2
what that is what you do and I'm trying

787.39 --> 797.0699999999999
to reflect it but when people just

793.2 --> 801.1
really make big mistakes in some way

797.07 --> 805.75
it's very rare that if I then criticize

801.1 --> 807.52
that that they'll be listening and just

805.75 --> 810.13
really take it out and not take it as

807.52 --> 813.6999999999999
some kind of attack personal attack and

810.13 --> 817.99
I shouldn't blame them because I have

813.7 --> 820.99
the same effect a lot of the time even

817.99 --> 825.52
though I kind of say like yes I do like

820.99 --> 827.6800000000001
criticism but it's not as much as about

825.52 --> 828.5799999999999
the criticism it's about the timing you

827.68 --> 834.0699999999999
know

828.58 --> 837.339
I want criticism when it's calm and it's

834.07 --> 838.8100000000001
kind of silly if people expect that when

837.339 --> 840.97
you do it like that that's gonna have

838.81 --> 843.5799999999999
some kind of terrible fact it doesn't it

840.97 --> 845.44
never does it actually helps but if

843.58 --> 847.1500000000001
you're gonna bring up criticism in the

845.44 --> 849.73
moment when things are really tense

847.15 --> 851.8299999999999
because you are reminded about it

849.73 --> 855.58
because you're irritated yeah then it's

851.83 --> 859.69
not gonna have a crit a good effect it's

855.58 --> 862.4100000000001
just gonna piss me off so it's all about

859.69 --> 862.4100000000001
the timing

866.77 --> 869.77
yeah

884.06 --> 889.9699999999999
all right yeah Oh ego playing anchor

887.45 --> 900.26
it's interesting to hear you have

889.97 --> 902.6
similar problems but look it's a it is

900.26 --> 906.35
that but it's a little bit more complex

902.6 --> 908.78
because in times when I don't feel all

906.35 --> 911.8100000000001
that great which may be physical in

908.78 --> 918.86
nature so I already said I seem to be

911.81 --> 921.2299999999999
having some problems just yeah in my in

918.86 --> 924.35
my belly region as it were and it's

921.23 --> 926.3000000000001
probably the the nerve center over there

924.35 --> 929.0
that is kind of reacting to something

926.3 --> 931.6999999999999
and that's probably things that happened

929.0 --> 933.89
in the past that are after a very long

931.7 --> 937.3000000000001
time starting to unravel themselves

933.89 --> 941.72
within my energy framework as it

937.3 --> 946.81
anchored itself there as a reflex and

941.72 --> 952.19
because of that I when I calm down I

946.81 --> 954.4599999999999
don't feel good I feel like it's in the

952.19 --> 958.82
way and the problem is is that as a

954.46 --> 962.51
reflex response what I do is I kind of

958.82 --> 965.2700000000001
abuse my empathy accidentally by

962.51 --> 968.02
literally in an escapist attempt just

965.27 --> 972.5
looking around kind of feeling miserable

968.02 --> 974.72
looking at somebody and then absorbing

972.5 --> 977.51
their feeling like looking into them and

974.72 --> 980.24
then kind of trying to forget what I

977.51 --> 982.1899999999999
feel by feeling what they feel but

980.24 --> 985.19
that's actually really unhealthy to do

982.19 --> 987.7700000000001
it's it's a terrible reflex that I have

985.19 --> 989.84
that it's not useful I should just be

987.77 --> 994.25
able to fully consciously control that

989.84 --> 997.63
and not do it as a reflex and that also

994.25 --> 997.63
brings extra problems

999.88 --> 1015.8389999999999
but yeah when I feel great

1002.23 --> 1015.839
that's never really a problem whoa okay

1016.47 --> 1025.689
thanks Trish live life for the thirty

1023.47 --> 1028.42
eight ninety nine Australian super chat

1025.689 --> 1031.1200000000001
dollar dollar super check the Haitian I

1028.42 --> 1036.88
guess you're asking me to get a Bible

1031.12 --> 1045.4199999999998
with that okay I'll look around I guess

1036.88 --> 1050.1100000000001
thanks but yeah just so you know that's

1045.42 --> 1053.41
like the earlier criticisms which are

1050.11 --> 1056.1599999999999
purely attitude based it still stands

1053.41 --> 1062.2
though like there is a problem there

1056.16 --> 1064.41
that I must address for my for my own

1062.2 --> 1064.41
protection

1077.059 --> 1086.9289999999999
okay well thank you for for the rest of

1080.269 --> 1091.839
that you were yeah you're not ban or

1086.929 --> 1091.8390000000002
anything by the way just but yeah thanks

1100.69 --> 1107.5800000000002
but yeah I kind of know about about that

1104.65 --> 1107.5800000000002
you know

1113.36 --> 1118.06
but yeah thank you thank you for that

1129.41 --> 1135.8200000000002
Oh nurse Steffen Alderson yeah there's

1133.1 --> 1138.4699999999998
not much of a topic today it's just

1135.82 --> 1142.75
talking about all the issues that have

1138.47 --> 1142.75
been happening in the last week

1158.81 --> 1165.1599999999999
alright i'll Zep tepi you call that

1161.93 --> 1168.52
honest I call that globe or baiting I

1165.16 --> 1174.02
call that catching audiences

1168.52 --> 1181.85
it's like political maneuvering I really

1174.02 --> 1184.67
don't respect that at all the globe

1181.85 --> 1187.37
model is a stage work of presuppositions

1184.67 --> 1192.14
it doesn't have a lot going for it at

1187.37 --> 1194.9299999999998
all but the whole system is an easy

1192.14 --> 1197.98
illusion to fool yourself with if you're

1194.93 --> 1202.3400000000001
if you keep yourself short-sighted and

1197.98 --> 1207.34
entertained by math trickery Wow okay

1202.34 --> 1207.34
thanks again free truth Tricia Blythe

1208.3 --> 1211.75
okay yeah

1219.14 --> 1227.0
all right yet the Arwen soaked army well

1222.29 --> 1229.78
it's out everywhere so everywhere I pop

1227.0 --> 1229.78
up they pop up

1234.51 --> 1239.91
I know really care about them too much

1237.26 --> 1240.9
they're just a bunch of socks it's just

1239.91 --> 1245.01
trolls

1240.9 --> 1247.3090000000002
more custom-made to associate with me

1245.01 --> 1247.309
somehow

1255.95 --> 1266.94
now if beat our desktop ski it's alright

1259.67 --> 1268.74
you know it's pretty sizable amount I

1266.94 --> 1273.0
think I don't know where the Australian

1268.74 --> 1278.82
dollar stands these days but Wow yeah

1273.0 --> 1281.67
it's like $60 or something Wow yeah it's

1278.82 --> 1295.23
it's a lot thanks thanks for that Trish

1281.67 --> 1299.18
Blythe mm-hmm I think Trish Blythe also

1295.23 --> 1299.18
just wanted to put out those messages

1300.08 --> 1306.8999999999999
she's I don't know still in the

1304.08 --> 1309.48
assumption that there's something very

1306.9 --> 1311.76
specific that she needs to do that she

1309.48 --> 1316.08
needs to convey a very specific message

1311.76 --> 1318.3
because she's somehow assuming that I

1316.08 --> 1320.4299999999998
don't already know that because of

1318.3 --> 1323.22
things that I have rejected that she

1320.43 --> 1326.93
interpreted as an entire rejection of

1323.22 --> 1330.0
the whole thing because the way she

1326.93 --> 1333.0600000000002
expects things to go in Christianity

1330.0 --> 1338.34
seems to be so extremely technically

1333.06 --> 1342.6599999999999
specific and I in general reject that

1338.34 --> 1346.83
notion that method that approach the

1342.66 --> 1351.65
specific the specific to me is not in

1346.83 --> 1351.6499999999999
the technicals it is in the frequency

1356.4 --> 1367.1200000000001
and that will lead to very specific type

1362.5 --> 1370.18
of judgment over complex situations but

1367.12 --> 1373.33
you can't divide that in technicals it's

1370.18 --> 1376.21
almost useless to do that you just need

1373.33 --> 1379.09
to get the frequency in order to get the

1376.21 --> 1381.67
right judgment and people will recognize

1379.09 --> 1384.01
it that's that it not even intellect

1381.67 --> 1388.03
they will recognize the frequency and

1384.01 --> 1390.61
see the purity of it that's the real

1388.03 --> 1393.6399999999999
thing it's not about the technical

1390.61 --> 1400.57
wordings and it's very specific type of

1393.64 --> 1404.6200000000001
thing you'd have to Det that's the whole

1400.57 --> 1407.3999999999999
point of my my eclectic form of

1404.62 --> 1407.3999999999999
Christianity

1419.27 --> 1430.46
that's been astronaut double-slit

1421.88 --> 1431.2700000000002
experiment in space crime yeah that was

1430.46 --> 1436.73
ridiculous

1431.27 --> 1438.71
yeah jaren ism where was it Judaism or I

1436.73 --> 1445.039
think it was Mark sergeant put out that

1438.71 --> 1449.96
and that was pretty good Wow gotta show

1445.039 --> 1452.529
you this before I delete him it's just

1449.96 --> 1452.529
amazing

1457.11 --> 1464.1899999999998
because everyone knows that if you have

1461.28 --> 1467.84
super chats available and a one

1464.19 --> 1471.45
subscriber guy that's taken a game

1467.84 --> 1475.9399999999998
picture and then printed their sloppily

1471.45 --> 1478.8600000000001
photoshopped head over it when they say

1475.94 --> 1482.39
that you're a show for shekels then you

1478.86 --> 1482.3899999999999
gotta take that very seriously

1492.759 --> 1497.419
that that was sarcasm I hope you got

1497.149 --> 1510.289
that

1497.419 --> 1513.1290000000001
oh look at how big they are

1510.289 --> 1513.129
it's freakin amazing

1535.57 --> 1540.35
in what sense

1537.289 --> 1542.6
Zep tepi already show i already share

1540.35 --> 1545.51
I've been sharing for a week now that I

1542.6 --> 1547.6399999999999
haven't felt all that great so if you're

1545.51 --> 1550.46
gonna call that depressed well that just

1547.64 --> 1552.919
depends on where you lay that line what

1550.46 --> 1556.6000000000001
is the depression yeah I don't feel

1552.919 --> 1558.23
super it's not the press it's not like

1556.6 --> 1562.6689999999999
nothing's worth it

1558.23 --> 1567.38
or no I don't feel absolutely miserable

1562.669 --> 1569.5900000000001
I just don't feel that great comes and

1567.38 --> 1569.5900000000001
goes

1580.97 --> 1586.22
no troll that's really asking to be

1584.78 --> 1595.46
banned but I'm not gonna because you're

1586.22 --> 1598.04
actually bringing up a good point right

1595.46 --> 1601.33
so yeah the globe model has

1598.04 --> 1604.8799999999999
presuppositions indeed and those

1601.33 --> 1609.02
presuppositions can be broken and they

1604.88 --> 1612.3200000000002
are confirm Utley broken like the

1609.02 --> 1614.42
curvature like the r-value like second

1612.32 --> 1615.6799999999998
law of thermodynamics those things can

1614.42 --> 1618.23
never be fixed

1615.68 --> 1621.44
those are presuppositions that are

1618.23 --> 1623.57
broken they can never be fulfilled in

1621.44 --> 1627.14
order for that specific model to work

1623.57 --> 1630.4299999999998
however my rectangular looping model

1627.14 --> 1634.1000000000001
indeed does have presuppositions as well

1630.43 --> 1639.3200000000002
but guess what they have not been broken

1634.1 --> 1642.37
they have not been disproven in the

1639.32 --> 1646.8799999999999
sense that whatever is required in order

1642.37 --> 1650.4699999999998
to confirm or disconfirm the

1646.88 --> 1654.47
presupposition of the looping element

1650.47 --> 1660.8600000000001
it's still out there to confirm or

1654.47 --> 1664.4
disconfirm okay so my model is not

1660.86 --> 1666.86
broken it's still open to prove or this

1664.4 --> 1669.98
proof that's a big difference with the

1666.86 --> 1673.37
globe because my model doesn't

1669.98 --> 1677.93
presuppose curvature my model doesn't

1673.37 --> 1680.7199999999998
presuppose a vacuum outer space my model

1677.93 --> 1682.79
doesn't presuppose that all the globe of

1680.72 --> 1685.01
the heaven lights are anything more than

1682.79 --> 1688.25
just light manifesting likely

1685.01 --> 1691.76
electrically through the ether somehow

1688.25 --> 1695.12
through the magnetics something like

1691.76 --> 1699.26
that but they are not literal physical

1695.12 --> 1701.4799999999998
things radiating light up there and a

1699.26 --> 1704.18
combination of all these factors that

1701.48 --> 1706.34
none of those factors have to disprove

1704.18 --> 1710.63
and that's why I really chose to them

1706.34 --> 1713.48
for the model well until those elements

1710.63 --> 1715.18
can this be disproven that's gonna work

1713.48 --> 1719.48
out

1715.18 --> 1724.3700000000001
presupposition II and hey maybe certain

1719.48 --> 1726.32
elements were incorrect well if that it

1724.37 --> 1727.1899999999998
turns out to be the case then I will

1726.32 --> 1730.58
adapt

1727.19 --> 1732.5
I will adapt a model because my model is

1730.58 --> 1739.1599999999999
really about trying to figure out the

1732.5 --> 1742.58
truth and not making reality adapt to

1739.16 --> 1744.77
the model that I am envisioning because

1742.58 --> 1745.6399999999999
you might have taken notice of I'm quite

1744.77 --> 1748.16
flexible

1745.64 --> 1752.1200000000001
I can presuppose a shitload of things

1748.16 --> 1754.5500000000002
I'm actually extremely good at it much

1752.12 --> 1757.6699999999998
much better than most globus that I've

1754.55 --> 1760.28
met even those that prize themselves at

1757.67 --> 1762.74
how well they know it and they do know a

1760.28 --> 1765.35
lot of math but I don't really

1762.74 --> 1768.34
understand the model as much as I do

1765.35 --> 1768.34
on average I think

1784.01 --> 1792.39
yeah leb yeah I was good indeed

1787.32 --> 1798.83
yesterday on those days you me and Riley

1792.39 --> 1800.7
yeah it was really interesting and yeah

1798.83 --> 1804.03
we got progress

1800.7 --> 1807.42
we got progress in flatter let's just

1804.03 --> 1810.1499999999999
call it flat earth science we got the

1807.42 --> 1814.8300000000002
relative density differential figured

1810.15 --> 1818.52
out and defined mathematically even and

1814.83 --> 1826.35
I'm really really enthusiastic about

1818.52 --> 1830.8799999999999
that also relative density differential

1826.35 --> 1834.809
sounds really well it's a very math the

1830.88 --> 1839.97
Holy Mass holic accommodating type of

1834.809 --> 1844.26
word so it's it's gonna be tough to

1839.97 --> 1847.46
reject it outright as much because the

1844.26 --> 1851.09
word the circle Librium is not in it I

1847.46 --> 1851.0900000000001
really don't like that

1860.83 --> 1868.57
yeah septa pbut there is so much

1864.37 --> 1871.4099999999999
nonsense that ballers and whoever people

1868.57 --> 1874.12
are suggesting cannot be possible of

1871.41 --> 1876.49
that is the fantasy Glover's have a

1874.12 --> 1878.8
fancy about the ball and how the world

1876.49 --> 1881.6200000000001
must be a ball and then they think oh

1878.8 --> 1883.69
and this is the Flat Earth model and

1881.62 --> 1886.6599999999999
then they make their Flat Earth model

1883.69 --> 1889.48
and complete junk on average they take

1886.66 --> 1891.49
really short-sighted stupid steps and

1889.48 --> 1895.0
don't evolve it don't actually try to

1891.49 --> 1898.24
fix it and then they say oh look it's

1895.0 --> 1900.46
not like the Flat Earth model reality is

1898.24 --> 1902.08
not like the Flat Earth model that's

1900.46 --> 1906.22
what they say all the time it's a total

1902.08 --> 1909.6399999999999
gaslight nonsense because they don't

1906.22 --> 1914.3500000000001
know [Â __Â ] about any Flat Earth model for

1909.64 --> 1917.5300000000002
real and to just assume that it is not

1914.35 --> 1921.6899999999998
like that model that's ridiculous that's

1917.53 --> 1921.69
not even how modelling really works

1940.419 --> 1955.21
no no cept happy that's not true that's

1948.159 --> 1958.0590000000002
not true it's just not that's again it's

1955.21 --> 1960.039
so tough to step away from the disc

1958.059 --> 1962.26
isn't it every time you talk about Flat

1960.039 --> 1965.83
Earth because yeah the Flat Earth disc

1962.26 --> 1971.679
literalists right they are assuming that

1965.83 --> 1974.77
the celestial North Pole is the exact or

1971.679 --> 1981.549
rough exact middle point of the realm

1974.77 --> 1983.649
atop there right now if you've heard me

1981.549 --> 1985.929
explain about the celestial bodies on a

1983.649 --> 1987.8799999999999
rectangular looping Flat Earth model and

1985.929 --> 1989.679
I've had very specific hangouts about

1987.88 --> 1995.1100000000001
this even before the Flat Earth the

1989.679 --> 1998.95
early birds that could all change if you

1995.11 --> 2005.399
move beyond the north wall to the land

1998.95 --> 2008.7
beyond because yeah the celestial North

2005.399 --> 2012.4699999999998
Pole could simply this the celestial

2008.7 --> 2020.3600000000001
sphere with the the north pole star

2012.47 --> 2023.909
simply could rotate on and even another

2020.36 --> 2028.11
dem eye globe of stars could review

2023.909 --> 2030.0590000000002
itself after that point yeah it sounds

2028.11 --> 2033.08
really science fictiony but that is if

2030.059 --> 2037.1689999999999
you just consider it as a holographic

2033.08 --> 2040.26
phenomena that is very easy to imagine

2037.169 --> 2043.5590000000002
for me that there could be other types

2040.26 --> 2047.429
of than my globes of stars other star

2043.559 --> 2049.47
constellations beyond the north and even

2047.429 --> 2055.589
beyond the south if there are similar

2049.47 --> 2058.31
lands beyond that region to other new

2055.589 --> 2058.31
equators

2068.45 --> 2080.48
inception her theory why now that's

2076.16 --> 2080.48
that's very simulation theory

2088.069 --> 2094.349
yeah flattered for life works in the

2091.8 --> 2096.96
comte concave earth model except nothing

2094.349 --> 2101.089
works in the concave model literally

2096.96 --> 2104.76
nothing because there's no curvature and

2101.089 --> 2109.0099999999998
it's just really stupid to suggest there

2104.76 --> 2114.48
is and then there is the problem with oh

2109.01 --> 2116.7900000000004
is it like stationary as well because if

2114.48 --> 2119.97
it would be moving there would be severe

2116.79 --> 2122.22
imbalance in the centrifugal force that

2119.97 --> 2123.9599999999996
will be supposedly causing it unless it

2122.22 --> 2124.859
was some kind of disc and it's not

2123.96 --> 2129.39
Hollow Earth

2124.859 --> 2132.98
it's just spatially nonlinear in what

2129.39 --> 2138.75
happens to be some kind of weird

2132.98 --> 2142.91
rotating wheel setup okay but I don't

2138.75 --> 2142.91
think the earth is moving at all

2154.37 --> 2160.9
yeah I know inception dude I know in

2158.0 --> 2160.9
saps you know gate

2174.96 --> 2180.76
yeah clean what is very interesting

2177.19 --> 2182.859
about the movie though as a side note

2180.76 --> 2186.4900000000002
besides the dream within a dream within

2182.859 --> 2188.68
a dream thingy micro escapes with lots

2186.49 --> 2192.06
of time I really thought the time factor

2188.68 --> 2194.5
was very good about it it's fascinating

2192.06 --> 2196.93
but another good thing about it is

2194.5 --> 2201.46
basically the intro scenes where the

2196.93 --> 2203.44
renew recruit is being taught how to the

2201.46 --> 2210.64
architect of the dream how to build

2203.44 --> 2214.93
things because well because it just

2210.64 --> 2219.5789999999997
shows what you do in your mind when you

2214.93 --> 2221.3199999999997
try to conceptualize things and then it

2219.579 --> 2223.4500000000003
kind of heard in the movie and

2221.32 --> 2226.38
potentially in the dark world experience

2223.45 --> 2228.3999999999996
that could be similar it would simply be

2226.38 --> 2231.67
demonstrated what it would really look

2228.4 --> 2235.42
like more effectively than just your

2231.67 --> 2237.579
attempt at imagining it and that's

2235.42 --> 2239.349
really fascinating about that movie I

2237.579 --> 2240.6400000000003
thought the first part especially it's

2239.349 --> 2244.48
just really fascinating the rest is just

2240.64 --> 2246.8489999999997
more like weird hypee action stuff and

2244.48 --> 2250.15
slow time and all that and it is kind of

2246.849 --> 2251.8590000000004
cool especially with music but the intro

2250.15 --> 2254.6800000000003
where they actually talk about being an

2251.859 --> 2256.74
architect in the dream that's that part

2254.68 --> 2260.0789999999997
was just really really good and

2256.74 --> 2264.52
fascinating as good as the matrix

2260.079 --> 2266.98
basically with when they did that it's

2264.52 --> 2271.3
really where the cosmology of what is

2266.98 --> 2273.66
being done is defined and I always love

2271.3 --> 2273.6600000000003
that [Â __Â ]

2297.31 --> 2301.5
so you'd are you trolling me now

2343.16 --> 2352.5499999999997
well Fyodor Dostoevsky I'm pretty sure

2345.59 --> 2356.54
there's only one material realm but

2352.55 --> 2359.9
there may be spiritual realms where

2356.54 --> 2365.48
everything is stabilized to be very much

2359.9 --> 2368.03
like the material realm there could

2365.48 --> 2374.48
definitely be those I think I went there

2368.03 --> 2376.76
some time ago but I think there's only

2374.48 --> 2379.01
one real physical realm and basically

2376.76 --> 2381.2200000000003
all the other dimensions are in some

2379.01 --> 2384.6200000000003
mysterious way tied into it

2381.22 --> 2389.02
they're all like a an echo in some way

2384.62 --> 2393.58
it's it's very complex and entangled how

2389.02 --> 2393.58
are the spiritual realms work

2416.089 --> 2422.65
what are you talking about clean you're

2419.809 --> 2422.65
being kind of weird

2433.84 --> 2436.8900000000003
your songs

2442.72 --> 2452.7999999999997
yeah too much information you go played

2449.589 --> 2458.219
an anchor don't do drugs

2452.8 --> 2458.219
[Music]

2467.26 --> 2474.099
huh

2469.73 --> 2474.099
I didn't know you made music gleam

2478.39 --> 2487.5589999999997
yeah all right well I'm gonna listen I

2483.789 --> 2487.559
did another time not during the show

2529.89 --> 2534.269
sorry it's still very hot here

2550.58 --> 2556.83
yes Amanda young haven't you seen Star

2553.56 --> 2565.14
Wars the spate and the space treaty with

2556.83 --> 2566.91
the Federation blah blah you can make

2565.14 --> 2571.58
all kinds of treaties okay yeah there's

2566.91 --> 2575.8799999999997
people that have actually paid money to

2571.58 --> 2577.74
officially Oh spots on the moon okay

2575.88 --> 2581.6400000000003
yeah you can have treaties you can have

2577.74 --> 2585.99
contracts for really silly things that

2581.64 --> 2590.0899999999997
it doesn't make it real though it just

2585.99 --> 2590.0899999999997
makes people really silly

2635.55 --> 2638.679
[Music]

2667.46 --> 2677.45
don't be silly demons are not physical

2671.9 --> 2680.15
entities they never are they dwell in

2677.45 --> 2683.27
the spiritual realm and they can enter

2680.15 --> 2685.3
us through our through the holes in our

2683.27 --> 2688.28
mind

2685.3 --> 2689.1800000000003
and as for aliens I don't know exactly

2688.28 --> 2693.77
what that is

2689.18 --> 2698.44
besides a giant media hoax but yeah they

2693.77 --> 2701.15
could be just weird engineered creatures

2698.44 --> 2705.05
and I've heard it before that they were

2701.15 --> 2708.589
perhaps meant as like interfaith scible

2705.05 --> 2712.9100000000003
husks for demonic entities or of the

2708.589 --> 2716.15
likes that they're basically biochemical

2712.91 --> 2717.6499999999996
drones for psionic interfacing and

2716.15 --> 2719.809
wouldn't be surprised if that really is

2717.65 --> 2722.7200000000003
the case it that would make them

2719.809 --> 2725.48
automatons and yeah despite that also

2722.72 --> 2727.73
coming from kind of the CIA region of

2725.48 --> 2730.79
input I think that's really a reasonable

2727.73 --> 2737.559
thing to assume it doesn't really make

2730.79 --> 2742.069
them aliens they it makes them human

2737.559 --> 2745.6090000000004
fabricated maybe fabricated from some

2742.069 --> 2747.47
very ancient stuff that that they've

2745.609 --> 2749.869
haven't from the in hidden in the

2747.47 --> 2751.7599999999998
Vatican or whatever [Â __Â ] the ultimate

2749.869 --> 2753.9500000000003
blueprint to create one of those otama

2751.76 --> 2757.849
towns may not have been of human design

2753.95 --> 2760.16
as far as we know but if there's these

2757.849 --> 2763.069
creatures out there then they have very

2760.16 --> 2766.91
likely been physically fabricated by

2763.069 --> 2771.41
humans and whatever they interface with

2766.91 --> 2779.299
whether human or non-human there is just

2771.41 --> 2781.609
no original homeworld of aliens

2779.299 --> 2785.02
somewhere else unless it was

2781.609 --> 2787.549
specifically made programmed

2785.02 --> 2791.869
pre-programmed like started up with a

2787.549 --> 2794.569
fake story for them by humans like oh

2791.869 --> 2795.15
you have to be a colony of aliens now

2794.569 --> 2798.93
and

2795.15 --> 2801.57
and put them there put them into a sort

2798.93 --> 2804.75
of busying routine and then make them

2801.57 --> 2811.38
forget that it was all set up and make

2804.75 --> 2815.88
it real who knows my imagination of how

2811.38 --> 2825.48
these things can be done now very little

2815.88 --> 2829.77
limits you know if you go by the

2825.48 --> 2832.44
believing the mandala effect that yeah

2829.77 --> 2835.59
half the world could or maybe the entire

2832.44 --> 2837.51
world could basically be reprogrammed in

2835.59 --> 2841.05
a moment's notice thanks to some kind of

2837.51 --> 2843.5400000000004
extra dimensional effect then how hard

2841.05 --> 2847.05
would it be to just create some kind of

2843.54 --> 2850.14
weird alien like species out of nothing

2847.05 --> 2853.23
and just introduce them like they were

2850.14 --> 2856.02
always there but hidden and they could

2853.23 --> 2860.4
be hidden for a very long time doing a

2856.02 --> 2861.9
lot of stuff you know they could you

2860.4 --> 2864.15
know let's just say they could

2861.9 --> 2868.29
technically be around since the early

2864.15 --> 2869.9700000000003
nineteen or the early 20th century that

2868.29 --> 2871.83
they were kind of summoned into being

2869.97 --> 2874.8799999999997
that they were created and they're

2871.83 --> 2879.2999999999997
they're there they do their own things a

2874.88 --> 2881.82
secret creation oh man and they're kind

2879.3 --> 2884.3100000000004
of kept in the shadows and sort of

2881.82 --> 2889.38
exploited may be abused may be used for

2884.31 --> 2893.64
fear porn whatever it could be there I'm

2889.38 --> 2895.83
not excluding it it's just not really

2893.64 --> 2897.75
that important if you realize that

2895.83 --> 2900.5699999999997
whatever is going to be there is very

2897.75 --> 2905.93
likely originating from being created by

2900.57 --> 2905.9300000000003
humans just saying

2936.43 --> 2939.43
No

2941.74 --> 2946.56
you don't see demons you can feel them

2949.13 --> 2959.21
you can feel them I can feel demonic

2951.65 --> 2962.2400000000002
presence it's just the darkness they

2959.21 --> 2964.63
can't manifest without it it has to be

2962.24 --> 2968.5
there in order for them to be there

2964.63 --> 2968.5
otherwise they can't connect

2984.579 --> 2987.0890000000004
yeah

2998.049 --> 3003.369
so yet that but again you know people

3001.329 --> 3006.0890000000004
may have so many ideas and opinions

3003.369 --> 3008.559
about aliens and what they are and

3006.089 --> 3011.38
there's literally graph already said

3008.559 --> 3015.4300000000003
this many times even in the past I admit

3011.38 --> 3018.009
I've dealt with people that had very

3015.43 --> 3020.2
kind of weird beliefs that aliens were

3018.009 --> 3021.789
actually just extra dimensionals and

3020.2 --> 3026.259
there were friends and they would

3021.789 --> 3029.079
literally do rituals to summon them in

3026.259 --> 3032.44
circles and talk to their spirits and it

3029.079 --> 3034.4500000000003
was creepy as [Â __Â ] to just hear them say

3032.44 --> 3037.619
that like it wasn't a normal thing in

3034.45 --> 3045.009
the world like what the hell do you just

3037.619 --> 3047.71
are you literally deluding yourself you

3045.009 --> 3050.039
can't be that dumb I just can't believe

3047.71 --> 3050.039
it

3057.24 --> 3065.2
but I don't know my interpretations of

3062.11 --> 3070.08
aliens and what has been said about them

3065.2 --> 3073.48
is very narrow and it's kind of to me

3070.08 --> 3076.33
however I see it it's always not gonna

3073.48 --> 3083.02
be as fantastical as they try to make

3076.33 --> 3086.23
you feel about it so it as I said

3083.02 --> 3090.15
whatever physical alien thing would be

3086.23 --> 3090.15
there it's very likely man-made

3102.829 --> 3112.63
no no gave him a mark you two they're

3109.849 --> 3112.63
not physical

3118.38 --> 3126.57
research it I've literally been through

3121.45 --> 3126.5699999999997
it I experienced it firsthand okay

3129.0 --> 3134.74
or are you talking about aliens now I

3131.5 --> 3140.82
don't know it's just no I don't believe

3134.74 --> 3140.8199999999997
that and stop spamming please

3153.98 --> 3164.75
right well bilgey yeah other-dimensional

3161.089 --> 3168.74
evil entities existing right what i am

3164.75 --> 3172.88
however disclaiming is that supposedly

3168.74 --> 3177.74
all non-physical beings are evil I'm

3172.88 --> 3181.07
pretty sure they're not but there are a

3177.74 --> 3185.8999999999996
lot of them that are and they're like

3181.07 --> 3189.7000000000003
like in a network as well their own but

3185.9 --> 3194.21
there's also very good entities but they

3189.7 --> 3204.0789999999997
tend to be hiding from the darker ones

3194.21 --> 3208.13
just to be able to survive so yeah and I

3204.079 --> 3211.46
have seen some non demonic entities as

3208.13 --> 3212.26
far as it felt didn't feel the same like

3211.46 --> 3215.15
the others

3212.26 --> 3218.21
so there's there's potentially a lot of

3215.15 --> 3220.76
weird things out there but it's always

3218.21 --> 3226.03
gonna be risky always when you try to

3220.76 --> 3229.7900000000004
explore there because there are like

3226.03 --> 3234.65
creatures that make traps as well that

3229.79 --> 3238.4
at first try to emulate a good thing and

3234.65 --> 3241.79
then gradually get you strung in and

3238.4 --> 3244.1800000000003
then they reveal themselves so it's very

3241.79 --> 3244.18
tricky

3254.12 --> 3260.819
it's yeah

3256.41 --> 3263.5789999999997
Rudolf Steiners teachings and my general

3260.819 --> 3266.88
advice is to just not engage with that

3263.579 --> 3269.789
just focus on yourself and try to keep

3266.88 --> 3278.9
yourself in the real world as much as

3269.789 --> 3284.849
possible besides if you resolve things

3278.9 --> 3288.69
about yourself when you're six and you

3284.849 --> 3294.63
fix things in yourself and around

3288.69 --> 3296.73
yourself then whatever is viable from

3294.63 --> 3301.23
the spiritual realm to come unto your

3296.73 --> 3307.41
path and take part Dave it will happen

3301.23 --> 3312.869
anyway if it was meant to be but if you

3307.41 --> 3315.0
go out looking for it especially if you

3312.869 --> 3317.2690000000002
do it kind of because you think you are

3315.0 --> 3320.13
not good enough and you need it somehow

3317.269 --> 3322.2299999999996
you are insufficient without something

3320.13 --> 3327.599
that is out there then you're going to

3322.23 --> 3333.539
be effectively looking for trouble so

3327.599 --> 3337.88
just don't go looking that's my advice

3333.539 --> 3337.88
in general don't go looking

3339.8 --> 3350.28
there are things out there and you'll

3342.48 --> 3353.61
bump in them anyway it's all about the

3350.28 --> 3356.67
frequency whatever frequency you're

3353.61 --> 3358.9500000000003
resonating with other things that have

3356.67 --> 3363.08
resonate with that frequency they will

3358.95 --> 3366.6299999999997
be attracted to you throughout

3363.08 --> 3369.08
throughout creation and then you will

3366.63 --> 3376.83
notice them and they will notice you

3369.08 --> 3379.29
whatever they are and then if you shift

3376.83 --> 3384.69
frequency yeah you may lose that bond

3379.29 --> 3387.65
with them and then suddenly you may

3384.69 --> 3387.65
resonate with others

3403.56 --> 3412.1
do I have any proof of this I've plenty

3407.55 --> 3417.4100000000003
of proof for myself my own experiences

3412.1 --> 3420.69
but yeah I don't have a visual memory

3417.41 --> 3423.5099999999998
projector so that it could literally

3420.69 --> 3426.12
show you what I experienced like a

3423.51 --> 3430.0200000000004
camera projection show you how crazy

3426.12 --> 3432.9
that really was I don't have that I can

3430.02 --> 3435.03
only attempt to try to explain it as

3432.9 --> 3438.33
well as I can in order to bring a cross

3435.03 --> 3440.36
across the imagery as I experienced it

3438.33 --> 3444.44
and the feelings that came with it

3440.36 --> 3444.44
that's the best I can do

3451.02 --> 3454.339
whatever his gleam

3471.41 --> 3476.42
man just it's such a big difference I

3475.59 --> 3483.15
just look at it

3476.42 --> 3488.4500000000003
the Sun is C it's now no longer on the

3483.15 --> 3488.4500000000003
side here and it's so much cooler oh

3488.69 --> 3496.53
it's just that yeah most of the hour

3493.95 --> 3500.1899999999996
when I do my show it's just trade on the

3496.53 --> 3502.5600000000004
wall and I'm cooking that's a lot better

3500.19 --> 3505.9500000000003
now now that the Sun no longer hits

3502.56 --> 3511.83
aside anyway I am gonna round out the

3505.95 --> 3513.5099999999998
show so thanks everyone for coming and I

3511.83 --> 3515.2799999999997
