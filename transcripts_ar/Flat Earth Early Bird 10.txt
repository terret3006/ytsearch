11.71 --> 21.46
Arwen yeah today yeah I have a guest

19.869 --> 26.369

26.64 --> 36.1
we'll see if he actually joins the show

29.919 --> 40.14
and ah that's done you ah yeah it's

36.1 --> 41.559
probably really late there right 5 a.m.

40.14 --> 46.14
5 a.m.

41.559 --> 48.309
wow it's really really early anyway that

46.14 --> 51.85
Rasta probably has to keep it quiet

48.309 --> 53.949
mostly because he has a girlfriend that

51.85 --> 56.28
sleeps pretty much in the same room I

53.949 --> 60.28
think so

56.28 --> 63.760000000000005
but anyway good to have you and yeah if

60.28 --> 65.53
anyone else in the chat for example

63.76 --> 69.06
would like to join you know what to do

65.53 --> 72.52
contact me on skype and if I know you

69.06 --> 76.14
trust you I will if you a hangout link

72.52 --> 82.17999999999999
so yeah again

76.14 --> 85.48
wow it was really cool today like the

82.18 --> 89.02000000000001
Sun is really nice and bright what it

85.48 --> 95.17
started out with actual ice on the

89.02 --> 98.1
rooftops they've even been spraying salt

95.17 --> 102.88
and everything to prevent slipperiness

98.1 --> 108.19
so yeah it's the winter has come it

102.88 --> 111.16
feels like is steadily coming I have no

108.19 --> 113.57
idea what the temperature actually is we

111.16 --> 116.71
check it

113.57 --> 116.71
[Music]

123.78 --> 133.97
right it's 9 degrees Celsius here and 48

130.86 --> 133.97000000000003
degrees Fahrenheit

134.99 --> 141.87
well not very warm but then again there

139.29 --> 144.29999999999998
is yeah it is pretty much full um day

141.87 --> 152.97
now and Sun is really bright so I guess

144.3 --> 155.85000000000002
that'll help a bit anyway it is cold and

152.97 --> 158.22
it's frog nosed by the weather report to

155.85 --> 161.6
get even colder up to down to 1 degree

158.22 --> 166.709
you oh yeah and in the night this night

161.6 --> 169.95
it seems like it did freeze minus one so

166.709 --> 172.44
yeah it's gonna be even more than that

169.95 --> 173.97
over the week so that's the weather

172.44 --> 176.88
forecast by Arwen

173.97 --> 179.09
good morning anyway yeah winter is

176.88 --> 179.09
coming

179.3 --> 192.269
let's hope no ice some beats come with

182.64 --> 196.01899999999998
it yeah what can we talk about a lot has

192.269 --> 199.59
seems to have happens there's this thing

196.019 --> 201.66
with Mark Sargent and the conference in

199.59 --> 204.09
Denver that was weird

201.66 --> 209.67
I watched the video of mark Sargent post

204.09 --> 211.799
the video but it seemed very I don't

209.67 --> 216.42
know it was hard to follow for me I

211.799 --> 219.81
didn't actually see it through but it

216.42 --> 224.35899999999998
seems like it's just like personal

219.81 --> 228.42000000000002
issues against other personal issues and

224.359 --> 230.489
a huge issue would Logan Paul sorry Russ

228.42 --> 233.60899999999998
not what you said yeah you following

230.489 --> 238.26
maseri though he has a huge issue with

233.609 --> 241.95000000000002
Logan Paul he's got a big issue with

238.26 --> 244.98
Logan Paul Logan Paul yeah I have no

241.95 --> 245.91
idea who that guy really is he's an

244.98 --> 250.59
internet troll

245.91 --> 254.909
elf with 20 million trub oh he's a rich

250.59 --> 257.519
internet troll oh so wait the subs guy

254.909 --> 263.55
he had that one did he show up

257.519 --> 267.09000000000003
yeah and mark left just because he

263.55 --> 269.639
showed up yeah he hates that dude ever

267.09 --> 272.599
since he went to Japanese suicide forest

269.639 --> 275.669
Oh that in like made a mockery of it

272.599 --> 278.90999999999997
yeah that was pretty disgusting but to

275.669 --> 280.919
then just leave can't he just be like

278.91 --> 283.71000000000004
I'm not talking to you I'm just gonna

280.919 --> 287.18
pretend like you're not there no because

283.71 --> 290.13
the guy was center stage as a VIP what

287.18 --> 292.68
what did he buy himself in like that or

290.13 --> 296.81
something I he was the surprise

292.68 --> 299.789
celebrity guest by Rowley David yeah

296.81 --> 301.5
just as I said I need it one way or

299.789 --> 306.56899999999996
another Robbie was gonna ruin that event

301.5 --> 311.28
and sure enough he did bad decisions bad

306.569 --> 314.27000000000004
decisions that's poor judgement very

311.28 --> 314.27
very poor judgment

314.93 --> 321.949
did he give an explanation as to why he

318.06 --> 324.93
did that did he think it was a good idea

321.949 --> 328.71000000000004
Jeff and his opinion that's a fillable

324.93 --> 334.83
him and and he does he still hold on to

328.71 --> 337.53
that after all that you know yeah that's

334.83 --> 340.71
what we need a flat earth I told you I

337.53 --> 344.969
was right about that guy hey more

340.71 --> 350.099
friction more infighting yeh more

344.969 --> 352.08
stalling more distraction yeah alright

350.099 --> 355.919
that get it now oh god this is so

352.08 --> 361.44
annoying anyway thank you for updating

355.919 --> 367.77
me right so that's what that was about

361.44 --> 373.8
it's just annoying as [Â __Â ] right I get

367.77 --> 377.099
it now Logan earth rights did he present

373.8 --> 381.78000000000003
like a Logan Earth model he would be

377.099 --> 385.5
charged enough to do it no he was

381.78 --> 389.14
basically fraudulently proclaiming to be

385.5 --> 395.53
coming out of the closet to Flat Earth

389.14 --> 399.78999999999996
those were his words right okay well who

395.53 --> 400.41999999999996
knows maybe he is you know it was

399.79 --> 403.09000000000003
hilarious

400.42 --> 405.91
it was very embarrassing nobody bought

403.09 --> 408.84999999999997
it it was Cricut

405.91 --> 414.46000000000004
all right everybody suspected him of

408.85 --> 416.62
trolling of course evolution I didn't

414.46 --> 420.90999999999997
hear it but yeah you could probably tell

416.62 --> 423.07
by hearing it but yeah you know some of

420.91 --> 426.1
these really crazy internet guys might

423.07 --> 428.23
actually do something like that and then

426.1 --> 429.97
be just really clumsy about it but

428.23 --> 431.62
you'll notice if they're actually gonna

429.97 --> 436.15000000000003
start talking about flat-earthers

431.62 --> 440.07
in a mild way then I'll sure but Robbie

436.15 --> 443.28999999999996
showed no respect to any of the previous

440.07 --> 447.25
featured guests and panelists like Mark

443.29 --> 448.81
and Patricia in doing what he did and

447.25 --> 451.57
keeping that all secret like that

448.81 --> 457.12
that was very very very unprofessional

451.57 --> 459.09999999999997
and very fun courteous but are you sure

457.12 --> 463.96
it's not just really clumsy and he just

459.1 --> 467.02000000000004
didn't know you know wasn't like rude to

463.96 --> 470.62
them all the way or no if he doesn't

467.02 --> 475.35999999999996
know that logan paul is a worldwide

470.62 --> 480.43
troll then there's a much bigger problem

475.36 --> 485.74
at hand a problem with judgment and yeah

480.43 --> 487.27
i do think he probably has that kind of

485.74 --> 490.54
issue and they're revealing let's hope

487.27 --> 494.13
he learns from it and let's see that

490.54 --> 498.88
this doesn't get too much out of hand

494.13 --> 502.63
it's stupid anyway it's all people

498.88 --> 507.7
people have blind spots in their sites

502.63 --> 510.25
and in their senses sometimes so yeah

507.7 --> 512.65
that sort of thing can happen it's very

510.25 --> 517.38
annoying when it happens to like an

512.65 --> 521.4599999999999
organizers uh I talked to mid eh see

517.38 --> 525.49
alive from the conference

521.46 --> 530.89
mmm-hmm that was nice he said hi

525.49 --> 538.8100000000001
shoutouts to everybody cool I chatted

530.89 --> 543.0699999999999
back alright so the controversy has

538.81 --> 548.4699999999999
already arrived three yeah I don't know

543.07 --> 551.8000000000001
let's just guess move on yeah it all it

548.47 --> 553.75
all was handled appropriately mark you

551.8 --> 555.4599999999999
know basically said he wasn't gonna be

553.75 --> 556.9
able to stay and be in a good mood so he

555.46 --> 559.87
wasn't gonna stay and bring everybody

556.9 --> 562.3
else down it was only prison for ten

559.87 --> 565.39
minutes anyways so basically you know

562.3 --> 568.81
let bitter let it go on without a hitch

565.39 --> 570.1899999999999
if it was going to be hitch less you

568.81 --> 571.75
know and I thought that was a very

570.19 --> 574.5400000000001
professional move on his part

571.75 --> 577.87
indeed now that's the smart thing to do

574.54 --> 582.5799999999999
also he takes it extremely life's level

577.87 --> 585.3100000000001
serious so yeah he's not gonna present

582.58 --> 588.85
something like really serious out there

585.31 --> 592.5699999999999
with all the he's got and then have that

588.85 --> 598.09
troll be like a star guest that's not

592.57 --> 599.7700000000001
gonna work together so I get it yeah I

598.09 --> 603.7
just thought it showed a lot of a

599.77 --> 606.28
professional decorum a Marx part a lot

603.7 --> 612.46
of people didn't quite see it that way

606.28 --> 622.27
but that's where I stand with it yeah I

612.46 --> 625.57
agree with him I get it now anyway what

622.27 --> 630.52
else what else is going on look to talk

625.57 --> 637.0300000000001
about the latest Gio Whisperer situation

630.52 --> 641.29
oh god yeah you heard it right yeah yeah

637.03 --> 645.8199999999999
that was awesome yeah the agent I called

641.29 --> 647.74
him out but that was hilarious that he

645.82 --> 651.57
actually after I called him out got

647.74 --> 651.57
caught doing that that was amazing

653.32 --> 664.48
there yeah they they really it almost

660.64 --> 666.58
feels like these these core globe words

664.48 --> 671.2
that are directing people and everything

666.58 --> 672.9100000000001
and upholding these anchors for ballers

671.2 --> 675.1500000000001
to fall back on like soundly and

672.91 --> 679.24
everyone like they're really almost

675.15 --> 683.04
becoming a political party and they're

679.24 --> 688.84
just sending forth their politicians

683.04 --> 691.12
with ears you know and just to keep up

688.84 --> 693.97
the fight without the ballast of the

691.12 --> 695.98
character basically it's literally what

693.97 --> 700.23
how politics works in a way it's

695.98 --> 704.41
ridiculous and that on top of their

700.23 --> 711.69
verbal politicization and their red

704.41 --> 711.6899999999999
herrings their total politicians Yuri

714.779 --> 719.399
they do their best I mean but you can

718.199 --> 725.0889999999999
tell they're desperate when they're

719.399 --> 730.129
sending in um no sub no name like

725.089 --> 730.129
unknown and all our representative

730.79 --> 736.62
anonymous new people that just came on

733.47 --> 738.6600000000001
the scene sure I'm saying fact that

736.62 --> 742.92
they're not willing to come in and

738.66 --> 744.329
finish their own you know five to thirty

742.92 --> 747.6289999999999
as they may be I mean they're just

744.329 --> 750.12
gutless wonders right and having all the

747.629 --> 752.5500000000001
devious tactics that really take

750.12 --> 755.49
learning and skill to get while never

752.55 --> 757.6099999999999
being on this debate before that kind of

755.49 --> 764.04
thing that was so suspicious immediately

757.61 --> 767.309
he used rumpus level acting light

764.04 --> 770.73
lighting trickery it's a total actor

767.309 --> 773.93
it's like no no you are not the person

770.73 --> 782.249
you say you are it's impossible just

773.93 --> 785.6099999999999
figured it out yeah I wonder if Nathan

782.249 --> 787.769
is gonna get his sound guy again to

785.61 --> 791.67
basically analyze the video just like he

787.769 --> 796.35
did with the GS River streamer once we

791.67 --> 797.79
move it but what was easier was I guess

796.35 --> 801.929
the fact that when the guy was

797.79 --> 806.149
challenged with unexpected questions he

801.929 --> 809.67
didn't have his own academics and

806.149 --> 813.149
wherewithal to actually answer on the

809.67 --> 815.24
slide his own lack of academic

813.149 --> 819.6
understanding it was it an exposure

815.24 --> 823.23
indeed yeah for the guests by the way

819.6 --> 825.87
for the Watchers the viewers we're

823.23 --> 831.74
talking about Paul Jay on sliders

825.87 --> 831.74
debates which number was it six oh eight

832.339 --> 837.5400000000001
when I get fixed or not it's asinine

835.199 --> 839.37
you're right yeah yeah the after show

837.54 --> 843.75
uncut indeed yeah the after show on

839.37 --> 844.41
unjust Nathan Oakley channels that was

843.75 --> 846.439
amazing

844.41 --> 846.439
a

846.55 --> 854.3499999999999
in the chat low and ute and yeah let's

851.5 --> 858.19
go through the chat for a moment goddess

854.35 --> 861.4300000000001
which Bella hello and Eddie Bravo fanboy

858.19 --> 863.62
and he brought up Logan earth most

861.43 --> 864.2199999999999
radial areas I didn't get it but now I

863.62 --> 873.22
get it

864.22 --> 876.7900000000001
a simulation dweller David read don't

873.22 --> 877.6
[Â __Â ] cloaks and what the who comes up

876.79 --> 885.18
with these names

877.6 --> 889.89
anyway a Mackenzie Shane Walter Lou

885.18 --> 893.41
flatlander oh it's good to see you and

889.89 --> 902.3199999999999
Jose of course earlier you said he might

893.41 --> 906.67
come on a bit later on so yeah yeah Paul

902.32 --> 909.22
J crash and burn right on the scene and

906.67 --> 914.77
immediately got caught being an actor

909.22 --> 917.44
and red-handed proof of yeah I think

914.77 --> 920.459
somebody talked to him to instruct him

917.44 --> 920.4590000000001
was amazing

923.55 --> 930.01
it was it was caught so red-handed

927.329 --> 932.05
people that really don't know anything

930.01 --> 935.29
about Flat Earth or ballers or what's

932.05 --> 937.81
going on might even suspect that we're

935.29 --> 940.12
in cahoots with the ballers and that

937.81 --> 942.31
they're failing on purpose to make Flat

940.12 --> 944.38
Earth look good and that it's all a

942.31 --> 948.55
giant conspiracy with the ball right you

944.38 --> 950.52
know it's all one giant agency that's

948.55 --> 953.079
what probably some people that really

950.52 --> 961.75
want nothing to do with this are gonna

953.079 --> 965.14
think about it hilarious but yeah trust

961.75 --> 967.18
me people newcomers people that never

965.14 --> 969.519
even considered or heard about feathers

967.18 --> 971.7399999999999
if that's not the case these people the

969.519 --> 974.76
ballers that oppose the flat earthers

971.74 --> 980.08
they're shameless religious fanatics

974.76 --> 984.01
with yeah serious ego problems

980.08 --> 986.32
and they lie out in the open in plain

984.01 --> 988.33
sight when they need when they feel they

986.32 --> 991.32
need to defend something to the death

988.33 --> 994.09
because they are religious fanatics and

991.32 --> 995.8000000000001
yet you can't control these people they

994.09 --> 999.7
can barely control each other they're

995.8 --> 1002.4
also in fighting a lot very brutally -

999.7 --> 1004.59
were each other but they keep that to

1002.4 --> 1006.66
themselves while usually in the flat

1004.59 --> 1009.15
earth when something happens then oh

1006.66 --> 1011.73
it's so highlighted any attention is

1009.15 --> 1015.0
good attention principle basically what

1011.73 --> 1018.24
some people think but yeah we're not the

1015.0 --> 1021.3
same group trust me or don't trust me

1018.24 --> 1023.88
look into it you'll figure it out you'll

1021.3 --> 1027.54
figure out what's going on just on a

1023.88 --> 1030.12
social level yeah whatever you think the

1027.54 --> 1033.42
earth is flat or not or globe or not

1030.12 --> 1036.27
doesn't really matter in that sense but

1033.42 --> 1039.74
yeah we are definitely not good I can't

1036.27 --> 1043.98
control the position group although yeah

1039.74 --> 1047.64
they try to manipulate us and we yeah

1043.98 --> 1049.53
they are kind of easy to predict because

1047.64 --> 1053.39
they seem to be in a distress situation

1049.53 --> 1057.69
so much so we do kind of trick them into

1053.39 --> 1060.39
performing their trickery their lies

1057.69 --> 1062.8200000000002
push them further to just expose

1060.39 --> 1065.94
themselves and to get all triggered

1062.82 --> 1067.53
because that is funny to some people

1065.94 --> 1070.1100000000001
Nathan especially thinks it's funny I

1067.53 --> 1072.06
too thinks it's funny at times although

1070.11 --> 1076.59
I wouldn't push it too far

1072.06 --> 1079.56
personally in my taste but yeah we use

1076.59 --> 1081.1799999999998
them but that's only because they are

1079.56 --> 1082.62
just out of control

1081.18 --> 1085.8600000000001
they're not in control of themselves

1082.62 --> 1087.9299999999998
fully and we are just well on the base

1085.86 --> 1089.1599999999999
level manipulating and they kind of

1087.93 --> 1092.8100000000002
deserve it because they're constantly

1089.16 --> 1097.3200000000002
attacking us every way they they can so

1092.81 --> 1101.12
it's a weird setup and it is naturally

1097.32 --> 1106.32
formed this way just grew like this so

1101.12 --> 1109.9399999999998
that's my social societal analysis of

1106.32 --> 1113.009
the Flat Earth and Father community

1109.94 --> 1113.009
[Music]

1120.24 --> 1126.78
well I think we've got about at least

1123.4 --> 1130.1200000000001
four to six solid reasons to send a

1126.78 --> 1130.96
cease-and-desist letter to a celebrate

1130.12 --> 1135.9699999999998
truth Channel

1130.96 --> 1139.72
just my opinion cease and desist how do

1135.97 --> 1147.79
you mean thief and difference yeah ed

1139.72 --> 1149.56
yeah see right but what's the context I

1147.79 --> 1153.1499999999999
don't know what you're talking about

1149.56 --> 1155.9199999999998
hey who's a thief morning guys

1153.15 --> 1159.16
good morning Jose it means cease and

1155.92 --> 1161.95
desist there for firming of religious

1159.16 --> 1165.93
zealotry and bible-banging as well as

1161.95 --> 1172.1200000000001
for fronting of piss drinking and

1165.93 --> 1174.79
basically all of the other negative hood

1172.12 --> 1178.02
ornament that they're doing within Flat

1174.79 --> 1183.1599999999999
Earth they're casting a nasty nasty

1178.02 --> 1185.83
shadow onto all of us and uh can you do

1183.16 --> 1189.91
it's freedom of speech you know if if

1185.83 --> 1191.6499999999999
it's that bad then just separate oh sure

1189.91 --> 1196.41
that's what I'm saying it's a big

1191.65 --> 1200.0500000000002
community so it doesn't have to be

1196.41 --> 1201.76
monolithic group you know sure but we

1200.05 --> 1204.52
don't need the most public group the

1201.76 --> 1207.25
ones that are get doing news interviews

1204.52 --> 1209.1399999999999
and all all the other media to be

1207.25 --> 1212.74
literally the same people who are

1209.14 --> 1217.0
touting this drinking and religious

1212.74 --> 1220.72
zealotry that's just not not a good way

1217.0 --> 1226.03
to go well then bring it up with the

1220.72 --> 1228.19
media if they get all the attention say

1226.03 --> 1231.79
hey look what what is going on you know

1228.19 --> 1233.77
yours also activity we demand equal

1231.79 --> 1235.9099999999999
attention because we are in disagreement

1233.77 --> 1240.559
with that group

1235.91 --> 1241.13
we want a fair representation something

1240.559 --> 1248.78
like that

1241.13 --> 1251.66
I just think you know they try to let

1248.78 --> 1255.37
themselves out as the alternative to the

1251.66 --> 1266.45
Flat Earth Society when in all reality

1255.37 --> 1271.25
they're just as bad or worse but yeah I

1266.45 --> 1272.6000000000001
don't think lawfully as season assists

1271.25 --> 1274.789
will kind of work

1272.6 --> 1277.2099999999998
no not lawfully I'm not talking about

1274.789 --> 1280.809
lawfully I'm talking about directly as

1277.21 --> 1284.15
them to receive it from all of the

1280.809 --> 1287.1789999999999
basically from the rest of the Flat

1284.15 --> 1290.539
Earth community basically did all right

1287.179 --> 1295.549
like that basically like a public and

1290.539 --> 1296.9
private stunt just privately Shelley but

1295.549 --> 1302.62
that's actually really interesting

1296.9 --> 1305.99
that's that that's that could work

1302.62 --> 1308.6899999999998
actually work because he will be put on

1305.99 --> 1311.559
the spot that way especially when we're

1308.69 --> 1314.15
all getting him involved that's smart

1311.559 --> 1317.539
what exerted Mart you should bring that

1314.15 --> 1319.159
up with mark Sgt Patricia yeah what were

1317.539 --> 1324.85
you drinking in the womb for nine months

1319.159 --> 1327.409
just curious won't flue it

1324.85 --> 1330.4089999999999
you were drinking piss that's what you

1327.409 --> 1332.2700000000002
were drinking mm-hmm oh yes you were

1330.409 --> 1336.89
swimming in your own patient breathing

1332.27 --> 1339.02
yes no you were it that is your it's

1336.89 --> 1343.1000000000001
mostly piss you're peeing it out you're

1339.02 --> 1344.96
drinking it so the same right then

1343.1 --> 1348.1399999999999
because the type of nutrients you're

1344.96 --> 1350.63
getting Eden it's called the otic period

1348.14 --> 1352.4
it's called embryonic fluid it's full of

1350.63 --> 1354.169
pissed because you're pissing right into

1352.4 --> 1355.94
the fluid and you got it in your nose

1354.169 --> 1360.01
and you got your mouth and you got it in

1355.94 --> 1363.289
your eyes nothing it's exactly the same

1360.01 --> 1367.1
any of the feces and whatnot is going

1363.289 --> 1369.2
out with human that can be where the

1367.1 --> 1372.9499999999998
waste is going out through the

1369.2 --> 1378.559
through your life I'm eating the nope he

1372.95 --> 1381.5900000000001
talks over here the umbilical cord not

1378.559 --> 1384.01
the same sorry it is kind exactly no

1381.59 --> 1389.99
it's not

1384.01 --> 1394.01
thank you oh my god he left and if he

1389.99 --> 1396.2
will stop then he's being nutrients go

1394.01 --> 1402.11
in the umbilical cord not out the

1396.2 --> 1405.98
umbilical cord it there's stuff going on

1402.11 --> 1408.2299999999998
but you know that's not the same as a 42

1405.98 --> 1415.24
year old man chugging a classic yellow

1408.23 --> 1418.1
sunshine no Pinot PBJ talking over here

1415.24 --> 1419.69
now there are some never never mind

1418.1 --> 1422.779
there are some weird things out there

1419.69 --> 1426.6490000000001
like the Gerson Therapy but that's not

1422.779 --> 1431.659
as weirdest yeah that you know about it

1426.649 --> 1435.279
right you go on a raw diet and you make

1431.659 --> 1438.7990000000002
sure you don't get any kind of sugar or

1435.279 --> 1443.35
refined stuff in so it can be kind of

1438.799 --> 1446.289
bland no not a lot of salt either maybe

1443.35 --> 1449.1789999999999
unrefined salt himalaya salt just

1446.289 --> 1452.57
nutritious raw as much as possible and

1449.179 --> 1454.8090000000002
then you take coffee christma not pure

1452.57 --> 1458.36
coffee diluted of course with water and

1454.809 --> 1461.12
that works really really well you can

1458.36 --> 1463.37
actually there's an institute in Mexico

1461.12 --> 1467.57
that still applies this to this day you

1463.37 --> 1469.4599999999998
can go there and it works and it is said

1467.57 --> 1472.07
let's just say it like that it is set

1469.46 --> 1478.22
but I definitely believe it to work

1472.07 --> 1480.95
against cancer of all kinds and even bad

1478.22 --> 1483.32
stage even if you have undergone like

1480.95 --> 1485.69
female carrot therapy and you're old

1483.32 --> 1488.059
your body and your metabolism all the

1485.69 --> 1489.95
[Â __Â ] you can still try that and there's

1488.059 --> 1493.6689999999999
a good chance that you'll just

1489.95 --> 1496.94
completely recover it's amazing there

1493.669 --> 1500.3790000000001
it's the funny thing is it's more than a

1496.94 --> 1502.669
hundred years old it was in the early

1500.379 --> 1506.6589999999999
20th century that he

1502.669 --> 1508.8500000000001
figured this out dr. gerson so yeah

1506.659 --> 1511.19
fascinating but it is kind of where

1508.85 --> 1518.57
coffee Christmas Christmas and general

1511.19 --> 1521.3200000000002
are kind of weird but it works yeah it's

1518.57 --> 1525.859
actually more healthy to drink coffee

1521.32 --> 1527.779
down there then up there kind of reminds

1525.859 --> 1531.22
me of that South Park episode where they

1527.779 --> 1534.249
start to eat the other way around but

1531.22 --> 1537.519
it's not that weird it's just coffee

1534.249 --> 1537.519
that's it

1537.669 --> 1551.8690000000001
no sugar and milk anyway yeah it really

1551.389 --> 1557.33
works

1551.869 --> 1562.759
I believe in it and yeah there are other

1557.33 --> 1564.619
applications like gods now you made me

1562.759 --> 1569.059
talk about piss drinking

1564.619 --> 1571.519
Thanks I'll keep it really subtle like I

1569.059 --> 1573.1689999999999
I would never recommend like oh yeah you

1571.519 --> 1577.549
do that every day all the time

1573.169 --> 1580.8200000000002
that's not how that works but there are

1577.549 --> 1584.029
proven certain yeah medically proven

1580.82 --> 1588.289
that in the morning after if you

1584.029 --> 1593.989
properly eat and rest that Europe is may

1588.289 --> 1596.929
contain certain processed bacteria like

1593.989 --> 1600.259
and yeah you can filter out parts of

1596.929 --> 1603.6490000000001
this and that can be very good for your

1600.259 --> 1607.3990000000001
immune system to digest and there's also

1603.649 --> 1611.9599999999998
certain access minerals that can still

1607.399 --> 1613.9989999999998
be absorbed so yeah it kind of does work

1611.96 --> 1616.69
and oh god there's even like weird

1613.999 --> 1620.09
things you can do with of psychotropic

1616.69 --> 1622.909
so yeah we like mushrooms and stuff it

1620.09 --> 1624.9499999999998
has like a secondary effects so yeah

1622.909 --> 1629.659
there is something to it but like doing

1624.95 --> 1631.82
that every day no never will be alright

1629.659 --> 1633.8300000000002
I've never signed the rates up there

1631.82 --> 1635.1399999999999
with the can and should factor just

1633.83 --> 1637.54
because you can do something

1635.14 --> 1644.23
doesn't mean you necessarily should do

1637.54 --> 1647.85
something right it is it is good to keep

1644.23 --> 1650.1100000000001
in mind in a survival situation

1647.85 --> 1655.48
if you really are in the middle of

1650.11 --> 1658.9499999999998
nowhere there's not any way most people

1655.48 --> 1663.46
are witness right

1658.95 --> 1664.96
Arwen yeah Arwen I'm trying to be

1663.46 --> 1669.31
annoying like the guy yesterday calling

1664.96 --> 1671.6200000000001
Nathan they then for real I got a I got

1669.31 --> 1674.53
a little challenge for you over here in

1671.62 --> 1677.56
today fluttered debate we are challenge

1674.53 --> 1679.3899999999999
you when the gravity housekeeping

1677.56 --> 1684.01
question coming you're just gonna say

1679.39 --> 1686.68
quick no no or whatever say no but do

1684.01 --> 1689.5
not mention the word aberration today

1686.68 --> 1692.2
not all screen the whole show you're not

1689.5 --> 1693.82
gonna mention the word aberration I'm

1692.2 --> 1697.39
not gonna happen I'm gonna tell you

1693.82 --> 1703.62
again I'm gonna tell you again about the

1697.39 --> 1703.6200000000001
gravity nobody's whispering this to me

1704.67 --> 1713.0500000000002
it was it was an echo bro okay I don't

1711.64 --> 1717.6100000000001
want to but I'm gonna go ahead and check

1713.05 --> 1719.29
it Jose on this yeah I did some I did

1717.61 --> 1721.99
some research it says that a hundred

1719.29 --> 1722.71
percent of the ambient fluid at birth is

1721.99 --> 1724.81
pissed

1722.71 --> 1726.43
so you're swimming in it it's in your

1724.81 --> 1728.2
nose it's in your mouth whether or not

1726.43 --> 1733.18
you're actually drinking or what not it

1728.2 --> 1735.25
doesn't matter it's there no it is

1733.18 --> 1739.3200000000002
technically give me that it is not the

1735.25 --> 1739.32
same substance because right because

1739.92 --> 1745.5700000000002
it's like steel turret stuff and you

1743.38 --> 1747.64
actually it out you actually fed through

1745.57 --> 1750.0
the umbilical cord and you actually

1747.64 --> 1752.41
excrete waste through the umbilical cord

1750.0 --> 1754.36
so if you do any kind of research on

1752.41 --> 1757.24
medical journals which is where I was

1754.36 --> 1761.2299999999998
just a minute ago 100% of the am beyond

1757.24 --> 1764.05
include is piss I just got a question

1761.23 --> 1766.42
for your vegan I I mean I I don't know

1764.05 --> 1768.52
what this because you came kind of just

1766.42 --> 1769.0900000000001
through these talking about piece all of

1768.52 --> 1770.77
the sodding

1769.09 --> 1772.6299999999999
because maybe I wasn't paying attention

1770.77 --> 1775.12
when are we arrest I was talking about

1772.63 --> 1777.3400000000001
but you came in like with that subject

1775.12 --> 1780.9399999999998
is it because something trigger you what

1777.34 --> 1782.74
they were saying or you people being

1780.94 --> 1784.63
against it I've studied this for many

1782.74 --> 1786.19
years and as far as me losing my sense

1784.63 --> 1788.1100000000001
of smell and taste I've tried everything

1786.19 --> 1792.4
I've even tried you're in therapy so

1788.11 --> 1794.7099999999998
it's not dangerous I've looked up there

1792.4 --> 1797.02
nobody said it's actually quite common

1794.71 --> 1798.76
nobody thing it's dangerous we're saying

1797.02 --> 1802.06
that it's not tasteful and it's not

1798.76 --> 1804.1
civilized for 2018 we don't need 45

1802.06 --> 1806.2
year-old men sitting around clinking

1804.1 --> 1808.6299999999999
glasses full of yellow sunshine it's

1806.2 --> 1809.98
inappropriate and not necessary what the

1808.63 --> 1812.88
hell are you to say what's inappropriate

1809.98 --> 1815.53
mr. Rose I don't think you shouldn't be

1812.88 --> 1821.5300000000002
advertising with it's just like okay

1815.53 --> 1824.2
fine don't advertise it don't advertise

1821.53 --> 1826.03
I see don't have you know are you

1824.2 --> 1827.5
talking about the flat earth you lock

1826.03 --> 1833.3799999999999
you up in a loony bin right it has

1827.5 --> 1835.48
nothing to do that thank you see it has

1833.38 --> 1837.0600000000002
nothing to do with a flat earth like so

1835.48 --> 1840.94
therefore there's no reason to go

1837.06 --> 1844.27
basically pronouncing your advocacy for

1840.94 --> 1849.19
piss drinking when the topicality is

1844.27 --> 1851.1399999999999
Flat Earth once again I'm not telling

1849.19 --> 1855.1200000000001
anyone they should piss drink I'm just

1851.14 --> 1855.1200000000001
saying it's actually fairly common

1858.06 --> 1872.56
it's like its first time on are you

1862.42 --> 1874.6000000000001
talking about me yeah you know I know

1872.56 --> 1876.6399999999999
we're talking about allegedly Dave if

1874.6 --> 1879.31
you actually want to know I don't even

1876.64 --> 1880.66
know what allegedly Dave is that beats

1879.31 --> 1890.35
because you obviously haven't been

1880.66 --> 1893.7
around flattered I see all these

1890.35 --> 1896.28
characters he was just incredibly

1893.7 --> 1902.919
flattered Oh

1896.28 --> 1904.749
oh my gosh very important yeah

1902.919 --> 1907.5700000000002
conference not on the panel is at the

1904.749 --> 1909.999
flatter'd conference over there in

1907.57 --> 1912.489
Denver at the Holiday Inn that's big

1909.999 --> 1915.3990000000001
deal I'm saying but everybody knows

1912.489 --> 1917.8890000000001
eighty people are alleged Dave was there

1915.399 --> 1920.889
from the very first conference on he's

1917.889 --> 1923.529
always at the conference oh boy he's a

1920.889 --> 1930.639
great speaker but he wasn't it was

1923.529 --> 1932.649
second to Logan Paul right right none of

1930.639 --> 1936.5089999999998
us wait one at Logan Paul there that was

1932.649 --> 1936.5089999999998
ridiculous absolutely ridiculous

1936.72 --> 1943.259
embarrassing Logan Paul got four million

1939.46 --> 1946.6290000000001
more subscribers off that little stunt

1943.259 --> 1948.779
again now that was a basically that him

1946.629 --> 1950.7389999999998
and Robbie Davidson think you know

1948.779 --> 1953.889
mutually crushed that have been together

1950.739 --> 1956.32
huh it was actually genius on their part

1953.889 --> 1957.9699999999998
and whoever whoever the hell in flat

1956.32 --> 1963.039
earth law and come in maybe it was mark

1957.97 --> 1971.1390000000001
sergeant for all we know our social

1963.039 --> 1973.33
media soul harvest I say we all got our

1971.139 --> 1976.09
opinion our take on different type of

1973.33 --> 1978.22
things some people talk about the bodily

1976.09 --> 1980.109
fluids if you will like it or not I

1978.22 --> 1982.539
couldn't care less I never heard about

1980.109 --> 1984.22
this ever before fluttered and every

1982.539 --> 1987.249
time I kind of hear about of it I just

1984.22 --> 1989.739
make my ears just seal and now hear

1987.249 --> 1991.929
about it because I don't I don't I don't

1989.739 --> 1993.609
I mean it's not my thing I don't gonna

1991.929 --> 1994.8090000000002
criticize anybody but if you want to

1993.609 --> 1998.71
talk about it I'm out of the

1994.809 --> 2000.45
conversation like earth conversation we

1998.71 --> 2002.8500000000001
nobody needs to be bringing up their

2000.45 --> 2003.8690000000001
like eager and intake habits yeah I

2002.85 --> 2006.269
agree with that

2003.869 --> 2008.869
yeah that's off the topic big time off

2006.269 --> 2010.889
the topic yeah I don't understand why

2008.869 --> 2013.7099999999998
everybody who seems to be into that

2010.889 --> 2015.6899999999998
can't believe that in its own topicality

2013.71 --> 2018.1190000000001
like they have to bring it into other

2015.69 --> 2021.0900000000001
other aspects and other elements for the

2018.119 --> 2023.759
sociality well I think that could have

2021.09 --> 2028.399
to do with that in their mind they just

2023.759 --> 2031.559
want to get rid of the taboo of it it's

2028.399 --> 2033.629
probably not really gonna work because

2031.559 --> 2036.76
it is so basal

2033.629 --> 2040.309
so basic it's just

2036.76 --> 2042.019
yeah that's right they just wanted to

2040.309 --> 2044.09
get the stigma out of it so that's why

2042.019 --> 2046.97
they have no business interjecting it

2044.09 --> 2049.8489999999997
into other things basically if they want

2046.97 --> 2058.399
to deed tabla lies it then basically

2049.849 --> 2060.1690000000003
didn't eat AB you lies it who cares it's

2058.399 --> 2062.27
like bringing the Bible into your flat

2060.169 --> 2065.27
earthing - oh well you know the Bible

2062.27 --> 2068.27
shows that the people making boy don't

2065.27 --> 2068.81
you you gotta understand we agree on

2068.27 --> 2071.089
this

2068.81 --> 2073.19
the agree on is it's the same people

2071.089 --> 2075.889
that are bringing the Bible like banging

2073.19 --> 2078.829
that'll bring in the history oh no it's

2075.889 --> 2082.28
not the same people all of them that's

2078.829 --> 2084.76

shoulder oh now you're gonna start

2254.5 --> 2266.23
talking about Donald Trump but yeah

2263.789 --> 2270.4
there was this highlight of my Facebook

2266.23 --> 2272.95
feed like news strum and poutine can

2270.4 --> 2274.809
save the world something like that does

2272.95 --> 2276.819
the only thing I saw and I saw a picture

2274.809 --> 2278.92
of Trump and Bloody Mary pudding shaking

2276.819 --> 2280.96
hands Trump and putting can save the

2278.92 --> 2282.549
world together so I didn't even read

2280.96 --> 2286.089
that see that's ridiculous come on of

2282.549 --> 2288.64
those sponsor sponsor thing is doesn't

2286.089 --> 2291.069
anybody find it a problem that there are

2288.64 --> 2293.17
people walking around and have the

2291.069 --> 2304.869
audacity to think that they are anybody

2293.17 --> 2309.67
to save other people why people think

2304.869 --> 2312.849
they are nobody can save other people

2309.67 --> 2313.4500000000003
it's only Jesus now you can help people

2312.849 --> 2316.539
out

2313.45 --> 2319.72
you can prevent [Â __Â ] from happening but

2316.539 --> 2322.059
yeah you're in complement you're very

2319.72 --> 2324.7
much also gonna be forced into certain

2322.059 --> 2327.73
choices that were actually do the

2324.7 --> 2329.4399999999996
opposite so it eat okra never fear how

2327.73 --> 2333.15
can you be a good guy at the hand of an

2329.44 --> 2336.9700000000003
empire that demands certain things from

2333.15 --> 2338.859
keeping going that situation like what

2336.97 --> 2342.0989999999997
you gonna do now you know I think Trump

2338.859 --> 2344.5
really is a really good guy but he's

2342.099 --> 2346.4500000000003
just in an impossible situation for what

2344.5 --> 2348.85
he would actually like to accomplish I

2346.45 --> 2352.87
agree with that

2348.85 --> 2356.11
I surrender really

2352.87 --> 2363.42
Thanks sitting here being subjected to a

2356.11 --> 2365.4
bunch of people were brothers and

2363.42 --> 2372.81
there's a big difference between

2365.4 --> 2375.1600000000003
American now Trump and Putin in Russia

2372.81 --> 2380.0499999999997
because he's been there a lot longer

2375.16 --> 2383.5899999999997
yeah but the network he has of people

2380.05 --> 2385.54
are pretty tight and they really believe

2383.59 --> 2388.15
in the whole thing they're really trying

2385.54 --> 2391.45
to achieve something and there are

2388.15 --> 2393.4
problems but they're just staying on

2391.45 --> 2395.35
track and just hope things don't

2393.4 --> 2397.7400000000002
aggravate and they don't seem to

2395.35 --> 2401.73
aggravate seems to go really well

2397.74 --> 2407.74
relative and but here in or here in

2401.73 --> 2410.44
America with with with Trump it's quite

2407.74 --> 2414.0099999999998
different because he has a giant

2410.44 --> 2416.71
opposition that is still there that is

2414.01 --> 2418.3300000000004
really getting in the way and dominating

2416.71 --> 2424.06
media so it's a completely different

2418.33 --> 2426.22
angle of approach basically and yeah

2424.06 --> 2430.66
that opposition is gonna be in the way

2426.22 --> 2433.93
for a long time like this it already is

2430.66 --> 2438.49
like two years now well he's our puppet

2433.93 --> 2441.79
like everybody else he's well maybe a

2438.49 --> 2445.5699999999997
puppet to some of the industry like

2441.79 --> 2446.98
always can't do without basically that's

2445.57 --> 2451.15
what you learn when you actually get

2446.98 --> 2453.19
there but show me it's not a puppet in

2451.15 --> 2455.8
the sense that he is only following

2453.19 --> 2459.4
instructions absolutely not

2455.8 --> 2462.13
show me show me anyone that comes he is

2459.4 --> 2465.34
really trying to direct certain things I

2462.13 --> 2467.29
mean that's that that's the monologue I

2465.34 --> 2469.27
understand but show me any politician

2467.29 --> 2471.1
that's ever said a thing against Israel

2469.27 --> 2472.96
or against the Federal Reserve I think

2471.1 --> 2476.17
they all those are the those are the

2472.96 --> 2477.91
sacred sacred things I'll never talk

2476.17 --> 2479.89
about so why are we given three billion

2477.91 --> 2482.29
dollars in Israel but they'll not talk

2479.89 --> 2483.93
about it in a certain

2482.29 --> 2487.72
they're not gonna just straight out

2483.93 --> 2490.54
decry or attack but they will say okay

2487.72 --> 2494.8199999999997
yeah it's a good prosperous country but

2490.54 --> 2498.4
it yeah there are obvious problems and

2494.82 --> 2500.26
we know how to solve it at the matter

2498.4 --> 2502.03
what reporting that we don't like

2500.26 --> 2505.6600000000003
certain things that are happening and

2502.03 --> 2508.42
that politicians and Trump I think even

2505.66 --> 2510.8799999999997
also did that it's not just lying like

2508.42 --> 2512.29
why should it be it fortune Israel be a

2510.88 --> 2516.07
rich country like they don't produce

2512.29 --> 2520.0299999999997
anything like they don't do like a damn

2516.07 --> 2522.76
thing like basically to be on the intake

2520.03 --> 2525.52
of wealth and dole and weapon through

2522.76 --> 2527.92
like right what three million dollars a

2525.52 --> 2530.7
year I know I know that is well that's a

2527.92 --> 2534.76
whole nother issue yet they ever done

2530.7 --> 2538.5299999999997
should be deserving any thing from

2534.76 --> 2542.01
anybody outside of themselves they are

2538.53 --> 2546.3700000000003
there's a jingly they're part of the big

2542.01 --> 2548.53
geopolitical strategy of America well

2546.37 --> 2551.0499999999997
the Trump Trump some [Â __Â ] offered many

2548.53 --> 2552.4300000000003
people think they are right and they're

2551.05 --> 2553.51
they're some of the wealthy they're the

2552.43 --> 2555.3999999999996
wealth one of the wealthiest countries

2553.51 --> 2557.53
out there so why are we given three

2555.4 --> 2560.02
billion and some of the top that why

2557.53 --> 2561.7200000000003
there's earned right and us don't wait

2560.02 --> 2563.92
their wealth isn't given her and it's

2561.72 --> 2567.43
only because it have to do if anything

2563.92 --> 2569.89
it's patrol these are all reserve I'm

2567.43 --> 2572.08
saying excuse me I'm saying that Israel

2569.89 --> 2575.2
unlike other countries like China and

2572.08 --> 2577.11
India who actually have GDP who actually

2575.2 --> 2579.43
have gross domestic product

2577.11 --> 2583.6200000000003
Israel doesn't have gross domestic

2579.43 --> 2586.5899999999997
product they don't do anything to earn

2583.62 --> 2591.12
money they don't do anything to

2586.59 --> 2594.2200000000003
manufacture and create industry they're

2591.12 --> 2597.67
literally a giant welfare state a

2594.22 --> 2601.66
weaponized welfare state that nobody has

2597.67 --> 2605.62
provided any justification for why they

2601.66 --> 2610.99
get a dollar well it's because they're

2605.62 --> 2613.72
God's chosen people that really never

2610.99 --> 2614.2299999999996
live in our arrest that I wouldn't go

2613.72 --> 2616.12
that far

2614.23 --> 2619.09
it's very complex

2616.12 --> 2621.31
country and there look that the thing

2619.09 --> 2622.98
with Israel and Jews in general and this

2621.31 --> 2625.33
is not necessarily a bad thing

2622.98 --> 2628.69
although yeah when they are evil and

2625.33 --> 2630.7599999999998
super greedy like the the bank the big

2628.69 --> 2632.71
bankers are then it is a problem but

2630.76 --> 2634.84
they're all about connections and

2632.71 --> 2638.35
everyone in that country will have

2634.84 --> 2640.9300000000003
connections and will at one spot in the

2638.35 --> 2644.86
family or another have a very rich

2640.93 --> 2647.3199999999997
person like a diamond dealer or a banker

2644.86 --> 2651.28
or anything that's typically traditional

2647.32 --> 2653.92
for the for the Jews right with their

2651.28 --> 2655.84
their paper their paper fiat money that

2653.92 --> 2658.9300000000003
they're all forced nurse and barrel of a

2655.84 --> 2660.82
gun right but that's that's their GDP

2658.93 --> 2662.8599999999997
it's not literally what is produced in

2660.82 --> 2664.48
the country it's just dependent on the

2662.86 --> 2665.02
network it's like their know what I'm

2664.48 --> 2667.21
saying

2665.02 --> 2669.46
and they are not doing anything to be

2667.21 --> 2671.44
receiving payments they're not doing

2669.46 --> 2676.87
right from the United States you before

2671.44 --> 2679.54
you hear from any damn thing or anybody

2676.87 --> 2683.5
so no other country should be giving

2679.54 --> 2686.85
them a red cent go agree I know that but

2683.5 --> 2691.03
it's the money is not for the public

2686.85 --> 2694.27
technically it is [Â __Â ] it's a part of

2691.03 --> 2696.7900000000004
the deal because my geopolitical

2694.27 --> 2701.44
strategy or what we're talking about the

2696.79 --> 2704.89
acne the governmental so-called entity

2701.44 --> 2709.3
that is Israel not individual Jewish

2704.89 --> 2711.6099999999997
people right peasantry and you do that

2709.3 --> 2714.25
and you do know that Israel that did

2711.61 --> 2716.35
forty percent of the Senate and I'm not

2714.25 --> 2718.87
sure of the house are dual citizens or

2716.35 --> 2722.23
United States and Israeli citizens so

2718.87 --> 2723.67
how is that back treason exactly thank

2722.23 --> 2726.91
you big and we're not saying you're

2723.67 --> 2728.89
demonizing the average peasantry of Jews

2726.91 --> 2732.1
on the streets over there that's not the

2728.89 --> 2735.7799999999997
situation that's not our standpoint yeah

2732.1 --> 2737.89
I kind of agree with you there that is

2735.78 --> 2741.0400000000004
yeah thanks

2737.89 --> 2744.58
too much it's huge but my problem with

2741.04 --> 2746.89
Trump is most of his advisors are our

2744.58 --> 2748.39
Israeli citizens as well look at who is

2746.89 --> 2750.73
is by opportunity and

2748.39 --> 2753.97
not rejecting your 100% right we can go

2750.73 --> 2757.66
you're 100% right right but is Israel in

2753.97 --> 2761.47
any way like hostile to the United

2757.66 --> 2762.339
States are you okay and are they hostile

2761.47 --> 2766.75
to other people

2762.339 --> 2770.349
what do you think they're do no do you

2766.75 --> 2772.39
know why my name is called Gao yeah yeah

2770.349 --> 2775.3590000000004
it's a derogatory term used to any

2772.39 --> 2777.64
non-jews so we're considered cattle this

2775.359 --> 2780.0389999999998
United States were considered cattle

2777.64 --> 2781.75
they print out that fake money and force

2780.039 --> 2784.2690000000002
us to use it under the barrel of a gun

2781.75 --> 2787.319
paying off people with that paper and

2784.269 --> 2789.99
and yes I don't necessarily know if

2787.319 --> 2792.43
everyone there has that mindset and

2789.99 --> 2796.24
probably a couple we're not talking all

2792.43 --> 2799.0
the people Charlie not for many - what -

2796.24 --> 2801.22
don't over generalize come on talk in

2799.0 --> 2809.549
the main the main drag in Tel Aviv is

2801.22 --> 2815.1699999999996
Rothschild Avenue of course not I'm

2809.549 --> 2817.15
helping a friend who's a Torah I'm

2815.17 --> 2820.299
helping a friend who's a Torah Jew she's

2817.15 --> 2822.099
very very smart up in Canada and she's

2820.299 --> 2825.7889999999998
being harassed and tortured by these

2822.099 --> 2827.349
Zionist BS sirs okay so I am I got a

2825.789 --> 2829.029
problem with the Zionists I don't have a

2827.349 --> 2833.38
problem with some average Jew they were

2829.029 --> 2835.779
the ones tortured they don't harass the

2833.38 --> 2839.069
National I oppose Zionism I have for a

2835.779 --> 2842.67
long long time and that please enjoy

2839.069 --> 2846.009
just as much a victim in their [Â __Â ] as

2842.67 --> 2848.23
the people that they attack York

2846.009 --> 2851.589
respecting Ellison Britney but we that

2848.23 --> 2855.809
we are not attacking right I'm talking

2851.589 --> 2859.029
about Israel and especially the Zionists

2855.809 --> 2863.4100000000003
they're very aggressive and conquering

2859.029 --> 2866.44
in mindset yeah derogatory towards none

2863.41 --> 2868.5989999999997
including you had a new cut you're not

2866.44 --> 2871.509
part of it that's how they operate

2868.599 --> 2873.039
that's how they think well but yeah

2871.509 --> 2875.92
that's a group of people they're like

2873.039 --> 2878.3190000000004
the political organization they control

2875.92 --> 2882.29
the churches over here they control the

2878.319 --> 2885.48
very comparable to political Islamists

2882.29 --> 2886.89
yes well they control the churches over

2885.48 --> 2888.6
here so if you're hearing people all

2886.89 --> 2890.67
these churches these Christian churches

2888.6 --> 2892.5899999999997
and pastors say all we support Israel

2890.67 --> 2894.21
the Bible supports Israel actually the

2892.59 --> 2896.1600000000003
Bible doesn't support Israel if you

2894.21 --> 2898.11
actually think you want to read it which

2896.16 --> 2900.24
I have revelation then she has big

2898.11 --> 2902.9700000000003
problems with who Israel is and it's not

2900.24 --> 2904.7099999999996
an it's not a country so so basically

2902.97 --> 2906.8999999999996
all these preachers are teaching [Â __Â ]

2904.71 --> 2908.25
that's not even in the Bible and and

2906.9 --> 2910.2000000000003
send it all they're getting all their

2908.25 --> 2912.42
people rah rah rah support Israel and

2910.2 --> 2916.71
all the politicians support Israel give

2912.42 --> 2918.9900000000002
me a frickin break people wake up yeah

2916.71 --> 2922.65
arranged having they have no business

2918.99 --> 2925.14
having military weapons like jets and

2922.65 --> 2927.03
mortars and rockets and tanks and all

2925.14 --> 2928.5899999999997
this stuff and I mean but as they

2927.03 --> 2930.27
wouldn't then they would be destroyed

2928.59 --> 2932.1000000000004
pretty quickly you have which would

2930.27 --> 2935.31
probably be a very good thing in the

2932.1 --> 2939.12
Palestinian alone answer your question

2935.31 --> 2943.14
no Arwen it why why would the entire

2939.12 --> 2946.95
world want them wiped off the planet at

2943.14 --> 2950.0099999999998
the dryer that community look you have

2946.95 --> 2953.1899999999996
to think about the other parties that

2950.01 --> 2955.7400000000002
are present they're like no it's like

2953.19 --> 2957.54
what you do wow it's just gonna be

2955.74 --> 2959.79
destroyed everything there's just gonna

2957.54 --> 2962.97
be a wasteland is that good it has no

2959.79 --> 2965.55
business being what it is in the first

2962.97 --> 2968.9399999999996
place it's a synthetic creation of

2965.55 --> 2970.86
[Â __Â ] yeah yeah if they just went

2968.94 --> 2975.63
away leave the Palestinians alone

2970.86 --> 2977.25
they've been there for that doesn't mean

2975.63 --> 2980.61
that Israel needs to be freaking

2977.25 --> 2982.65
destroyed yes they should they were

2980.61 --> 2985.76
created by Hitler in the first place to

2982.65 --> 2988.2000000000003
halt Palestine or Israel was created

2985.76 --> 2991.05
something else don't freakin blow

2988.2 --> 2993.27
everything up it's absolutely just take

2991.05 --> 2995.3700000000003
it cut just good money

2993.27 --> 2997.08
that's the money and see what I agree to

2995.37 --> 2999.18
that but you don't have to freaking have

2997.08 --> 3001.2999999999997
everything blown up that's just no you

2999.18 --> 3004.8199999999997
don't blow it just cut the money no but

3001.3 --> 3009.8300000000004
it was something radical like that it'll

3004.82 --> 3011.84
cause war okay yeah they they've been at

3009.83 --> 3014.33
war with everybody they're entirely all

3011.84 --> 3016.31
there the real shit's gonna hit the fan

3014.33 --> 3019.0099999999998
that happens and they do it's gonna be

3016.31 --> 3022.46
bad cradles where cities were more ones

3019.01 --> 3025.1600000000003
efficient ridiculous

3022.46 --> 3026.81
don't be so freakin irresponsible then

3025.16 --> 3029.21
then we should just keep funding him so

3026.81 --> 3031.64
that they can keep the status quo no but

3029.21 --> 3034.43
there's other ways to try to solve this

3031.64 --> 3036.68
kind of well how why should we be giving

3034.43 --> 3039.14
him money if we cut the money or because

3036.68 --> 3040.94
you haven't been and it's just become

3039.14 --> 3042.85
this way now if you're just gonna take

3040.94 --> 3046.31
it away it's just gonna kill everything

3042.85 --> 3048.38
just like if you give food to certain

3046.31 --> 3049.94
wild animals and you keep giving it to

3048.38 --> 3052.73
them and then stop they'll suddenly

3049.94 --> 3055.4900000000002
start the freakin death yes what I don't

3052.73 --> 3057.23
know it's if you if you bring wolves and

3055.49 --> 3057.74
start pretending start protecting the

3057.23 --> 3060.08
wolves

3057.74 --> 3061.79
it'll overpopulate destroy all the other

3060.08 --> 3063.83
nature if you cut off this so it has

3061.79 --> 3068.9
things supply to the walls well that's

3063.83 --> 3070.46
what they are as wolves the Wolves then

3068.9 --> 3072.14
it'll let the rest of the yeah I'm done

3070.46 --> 3075.62
this I don't totally done with this

3072.14 --> 3080.21
conversation to be done please bring

[Â __Â ] I really really am

3086.62 --> 3094.7599999999998
okay I agree a certain level but you

3089.6 --> 3098.11
just take it way way too far I don't

3094.76 --> 3102.71
agree to anything that results in quick

3098.11 --> 3104.69
destruction it's ridiculous still type

3102.71 --> 3108.61
of promotion of this will just bring

3104.69 --> 3110.75
more [Â __Â ] to yourself

people and send the three billion a year

3110.75 --> 3117.77
to brought to Israel I got you I agree

3114.89 --> 3123.2
to that that's a problem okay that

3117.77 --> 3126.23
doesn't mean you just go for four

3123.2 --> 3128.12
right-wing [Â __Â ] and just let everything

3126.23 --> 3130.33
be destroyed out of nothing

3128.12 --> 3134.33
don't know no what we're saying is

3130.33 --> 3140.06
translate be County need to provide one

3134.33 --> 3143.5699999999997
just one actual reason right they should

3140.06 --> 3145.97
be getting a dollar from anybody and and

3143.57 --> 3147.2690000000002
when they can provide yeah I know that's

3145.97 --> 3149.7889999999998
what you can

3147.269 --> 3152.569
use to win that's good yeah you can win

3149.789 --> 3154.429
you can have it all freakin blown up

3152.569 --> 3158.64
congratulations

3154.429 --> 3164.989
okay I don't agree to that no matter

3158.64 --> 3169.199
what right don't don't let things just

3164.989 --> 3171.959
be destroyed because something is kind

3169.199 --> 3176.039
of out of whack think they weren't

3171.959 --> 3177.1189999999997
attacking Biggs we don't you just say

3176.039 --> 3179.3990000000003
this is wrong

3177.119 --> 3181.859
take it away and let all hell breaks

3179.399 --> 3184.859
loose but don't you agree Arwen that if

3181.859 --> 3187.64
they weren't using the last multiple

3184.859 --> 3191.249
decades that they've had to wreak havoc

3187.64 --> 3194.399
with American backing then then if I'm

3191.249 --> 3200.339
backing stopped backing them they

3194.399 --> 3202.979
wouldn't be destroyed but they well for

3200.339 --> 3209.369
example what you could do what you could

3202.979 --> 3212.2189999999996
do is just do what America does and

3209.369 --> 3213.929
actually just take him down say okay

3212.219 --> 3216.149
this is wrong there's going to be a

3213.929 --> 3218.4590000000003
different government here it sounds

3216.149 --> 3220.919
really really radical that could work

3218.459 --> 3222.989
it's better than to just taking

3220.919 --> 3225.779
everything away and just bang bang

3222.989 --> 3227.459
everyone freakin dies over there okay

3225.779 --> 3230.519
that's stupid

3227.459 --> 3232.189
you're the one with many things instead

3230.519 --> 3234.1189999999997
of your letting it all be destroyed

3232.189 --> 3238.319
you're the only one talking about

3234.119 --> 3239.759
destruction that's gonna happen but do

3238.319 --> 3241.579
you think that that would happen if they

3239.759 --> 3243.569
hadn't spent the last 40 years

3241.579 --> 3248.009
reasonless Lee attacking other people

3243.569 --> 3250.829
right so it says totally good awesome

3248.009 --> 3252.569
everybody and since they've been being

3250.829 --> 3255.659
able to believe with protection and

3252.569 --> 3257.969
impunity don't you think that because it

3255.659 --> 3260.159
has her punishment that's right

3257.969 --> 3263.159
I agree but that's not what's gonna

3260.159 --> 3265.049
happen because the enemies outside are

3263.159 --> 3268.139
gonna just freakin destroy everything

3265.049 --> 3269.969
and everyone but as ref and when you

3268.139 --> 3271.9790000000003
understand why they feel that way though

3269.969 --> 3276.4790000000003
right yeah of course that doesn't mean

3271.979 --> 3278.8489999999997
it should happen you are you insane no

3276.479 --> 3280.98
but we're what we're saying is if one

3278.849 --> 3283.8
group and their

3280.98 --> 3286.32
and all of their constituents have been

3283.8 --> 3288.7200000000003
basically just like here in America we

3286.32 --> 3292.02
can't get mad that when we travel to

3288.72 --> 3294.7799999999997
other countries people hate us because

3292.02 --> 3296.73
of what our government does you see what

3294.78 --> 3298.8
I'm saying we know that and we have to

3296.73 --> 3302.369
take on that responsibility and threat

3298.8 --> 3305.3100000000004
when we go outside of America and hell

3302.369 --> 3308.1600000000003
even within America but outside but the

3305.31 --> 3311.2799999999997
thing is because things are being done

3308.16 --> 3312.72
in the name of the American people just

3311.28 --> 3315.1800000000003
like things are being done in the name

3312.72 --> 3317.2799999999997
of the Israeli people do you see them

3315.18 --> 3319.589
saying right so do you think that

3317.28 --> 3323.19
America just is yours to be completely

3319.589 --> 3325.2599999999998
obliterated a giant crater land no of

3323.19 --> 3327.66
course not that's why that's a problem

3325.26 --> 3329.2400000000002
then that's exactly what I was talking

3327.66 --> 3331.23
about if you just know everything

3329.24 --> 3332.6699999999996
everything from Israel because they

3331.23 --> 3333.9900000000002
don't deserve it they have no technical

3332.67 --> 3336.089
right to it and they shouldn't have the

3333.99 --> 3339.27
military that's gonna happen to them

3336.089 --> 3342.69
right and if somehow you're just that

3339.27 --> 3345.839
happens to America you think it's you

3342.69 --> 3347.79
don't they're also people okay no matter

3345.839 --> 3351.57
how freaking criminal their government

3347.79 --> 3354.83
is there's a lot of people there they

3351.57 --> 3360.03
don't believe that they may be stupid

3354.83 --> 3361.3489999999997
but I it's just wrong to do that sorry I

3360.03 --> 3366.48
