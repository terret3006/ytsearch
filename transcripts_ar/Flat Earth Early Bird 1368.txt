Paul Cook who's now having a live stream

225.56 --> 230.519

228.84 --> 232.14000000000001
it was gonna last like over two hours

230.519 --> 233.70000000000002
but it is

232.14 --> 236.099
been hanging around there that was

233.7 --> 239.33999999999997
interesting

236.099 --> 242.11999999999998

239.34 --> 242.12
uh

243.599 --> 246.92
all right so yesterday

247.62 --> 253.68
yeah it wasn't any ball busters or

249.84 --> 257.939
anything not even really any

253.68 --> 257.939
letters debate streams

258.12 --> 262.68
but

259.38 --> 265.919
that was Dell did go live

262.68 --> 268.32
and that was interesting

265.919 --> 271.28
good to see him again talk in the chat

268.32 --> 271.28
there and

275.699 --> 281.46000000000004
yeah Flat Earth British actually joined

279.06 --> 283.979

281.46 --> 287.58
thing but like on a boat but that was

283.979 --> 290.75899999999996
kind of fun it was in good spirits

287.58 --> 293.94
was good hanging in the chat there

290.759 --> 297.47900000000004
pretty much until Bob arrived

293.94 --> 301.04
and then I thought like Okay um

297.479 --> 301.03999999999996
I'm done here

301.979 --> 305.15999999999997

359.28 --> 365.21999999999997
I actually watched it back

362.22 --> 369.53900000000004
I watched back the entire show

365.22 --> 372.41900000000004
also then I proceeded to watch like

369.539 --> 374.88
episode 46 of the early bird show just

372.419 --> 378.59999999999997
to compare it

374.88 --> 380.759
and wow have I made progress like even

378.6 --> 382.38
in the way I speak

380.759 --> 385.56
it's different

382.38 --> 388.44
it's like really different

385.56 --> 391.74
it's fascinating to see that

388.44 --> 395.039
how much more fluid I am right now

391.74 --> 397.919
compared to back then and

395.039 --> 400.02
just less stumbly I was I was really

397.919 --> 401.94
just kind of like stumbling a lot of the

400.02 --> 404.4
time I was just keeping going and doing

401.94 --> 406.5
things but

404.4 --> 409.4
back then I didn't really feel like I

406.5 --> 411.419
knew what I was doing now I do

409.4 --> 413.69899999999996
[Music]

you mean my first ever show PGC net

457.64 --> 460.839
[Music]

463.4 --> 467.35999999999996
by the way there is a book

468.18 --> 472.74
that my dad actually recommended to me

470.639 --> 475.979
from Rudolph Steiner very specific one

472.74 --> 478.62
that apparently is so worthy

475.979 --> 480.65999999999997
that it's like a regular study object

478.62 --> 484.74
for my healer

480.66 --> 486.84000000000003
and a group of his that literally come

484.74 --> 489.12
like they meet every half a year or

486.84 --> 490.5
something just to discuss that book and

489.12 --> 492.78000000000003
the new findings and they've been doing

490.5 --> 495.18
it for like 20 years

492.78 --> 498.61999999999995
which is remarkable and it's not even

495.18 --> 498.62
that a big that big a book

498.96 --> 505.68
and I actually want it

502.919 --> 509.21999999999997
and I I can't get it like a new for what

505.68 --> 511.5
is it 25 Euros or something or 35

509.22 --> 515.039
so it's not even that expensive but yeah

511.5 --> 516.719
I can't do that now

515.039 --> 519.12
but I do

516.719 --> 524.24
really kind of want that book

519.12 --> 524.24
so that I I need some new study material

524.339 --> 528.899
it was by the way also studying the

526.38 --> 532.76
Bible a bit

528.899 --> 532.76
have been it's interesting

534.72 --> 539.48
also the way just it's written down

540.899 --> 544.92
uh anyway what was that looking for oh

543.66 --> 547.76

the name of that book

549.959 --> 552.959

science

552.959 --> 557.1199999999999

but technically I am opening up to

640.8 --> 645.959
having guests back but yeah somebody

643.08 --> 649.8000000000001
would have to offer to get on

645.959 --> 652.56
and it will be a bit tricky because it's

649.8 --> 656.0
gonna be through Skype and that's given

652.56 --> 656.0
sound problems before

658.38 --> 663.66
but hey maybe through the updates and

660.959 --> 665.04
all that it's been a while like three

663.66 --> 668.2199999999999
years

665.04 --> 670.26
maybe that it will work better now I

668.22 --> 673.64
don't know it's only one way to find out

670.26 --> 673.64

845.399 --> 849.06
station

846.48 --> 851.519
but then they had just views where you

849.06 --> 852.8389999999999
could literally see the Earth flap

851.519 --> 856.639
beneath it

852.839 --> 856.639
I don't remember where I saw that

858.0 --> 865.22

1230.36 --> 1235.1789999999999
like are they just trying to show that

1232.64 --> 1235.179
it's fake

1235.22 --> 1239.69
at this point I mean it it all seems so

1239.179 --> 1242.0590000000002
fake

1239.69 --> 1245.6200000000001
[Music]

1242.059 --> 1245.62
are they doing it on purpose

1245.78 --> 1248.1789999999999
is it like a

1246.94 --> 1253.419
[Music]

1248.179 --> 1253.419
a Priestly loyalty test like how dumb

1255.5 --> 1260.6

so that you'll still believe how loyal

1260.6 --> 1264.62
are you to the dream even when we show

1262.7 --> 1267.82
you it's fake

1264.62 --> 1267.82
maybe it's like that

1268.1 --> 1270.76
I don't know

1271.22 --> 1277.27
[Music]

1289.22 --> 1291.52
foreign

1301.7 --> 1312.24
[Music]

1325.539 --> 1331.3
right PGC net yeah exactly because they

1329.059 --> 1334.369
want it to be real it is like a religion

1331.3 --> 1334.369
[Music]

1334.94 --> 1340.3400000000001
something contradicts contradictive

1337.7 --> 1343.4
according to your perspective pops up

1340.34 --> 1347.08
then your Excel gonna stick with it

1343.4 --> 1347.0800000000002
because it is religious

1347.23 --> 1351.98
[Music]

1348.559 --> 1356.33

and then just not do it

1633.32 --> 1639.5
like a money scam

1635.6 --> 1642.26

1691.88 --> 1696.5800000000002

mean

1897.44 --> 1901.76
that wasn't there during Kubrick

1899.72 --> 1905.539
remember

1901.76 --> 1908.779
there was no yeah real seed yet except

1905.539 --> 1912.26
for probably like the that one footage

1908.779 --> 1914.36
of going over the moon surface

1912.26 --> 1918.5
that was probably

1914.36 --> 1920.9599999999998

2031.299 --> 2035.44
there's going to be like a conflict in

like this

2037.84 --> 2041.6789999999999
right

2039.159 --> 2044.679
I mean how many references are there

even from within like NASA to what China

2044.679 --> 2047.22
is doing

2052.72 --> 2058.839

2056.02 --> 2061.179
that footage that I just showed that I

2058.839 --> 2064.119
noticed on Dell

2061.179 --> 2066.339
their space station with like the Flat

2066.339 --> 2072.04

completely parallel to mine so

2507.7 --> 2511.96
it's going to end before I even end my

2509.92 --> 2515.14
show you always do that you always post

2511.96 --> 2518.38
it right you plan it right in the middle

of my show every time Nathan

2518.38 --> 2521.339
do it every weekend

2524.02 --> 2527.68
right so then I end the show and I'm

2526.06 --> 2530.14
like oh yeah let's watch the flatter

2527.68 --> 2531.46
debates from a few days ago and then

2530.14 --> 2535.48
it's over

2531.46 --> 2537.7

Rockets this is

well yeah Tony Whitcomb

2618.88 --> 2624.88
but is it seriously like how much of a

2622.359 --> 2627.88
difference would it effectively make

2624.88 --> 2630.599
because NASA is not like the majority of

2627.88 --> 2630.599
the budget

2640.78 --> 2646.5400000000004
I think that that's reserved for like

2643.54 --> 2650.14
the military industrial complex

2646.54 --> 2653.819
they actually get the most money

2650.14 --> 2653.819

50 minutes or half hour sometimes before

2769.0 --> 2772.72

2771.099 --> 2774.4
come rolling in but there's no live show

2772.72 --> 2777.8999999999996
right now from Nathan it's just a

you got a Doctor Phil commercial

2791.619 --> 2799.44
what the [ __ ] he's still doing [ __ ]

2795.76 --> 2799.44
when the hell is he gonna retire

2803.44 --> 2809.68
I'm amazed he's still around

2806.5 --> 2812.92
they survived the vaccine [ __ ] and all

2809.68 --> 2812.9199999999996
that huh

2833.92 --> 2839.2000000000003
you only pay attention to Nature when it

2837.099 --> 2842.56
comes to the shape of the Earth

2839.2 --> 2844.24
really how did you derive from nature

2842.56 --> 2847.54
that you could have a

2844.24 --> 2849.8799999999997
straight line of sight to the horizon

2847.54 --> 2853.079
yet that light is bent how did you

2849.88 --> 2853.079
derive that from nature

2870.819 --> 2875.64
hey Jeff guy said

2872.619 --> 2875.6400000000003
good to see you

2898.72 --> 2903.3999999999996
yeah PGC net good point

2901.359 --> 2906.52
but it's a complicated setup because

2903.4 --> 2909.1600000000003
military is kind of integral to the

2906.52 --> 2914.74
United States and it's set up

2909.16 --> 2917.319
but it in itself has like corrupted

2914.74 --> 2918.819
right so it's like it's become its own

2917.319 --> 2922.72
Guild

2918.819 --> 2924.64
and they're not exactly benevolent to

2922.72 --> 2928.0
the citizens

2924.64 --> 2930.5789999999997
the organization of it

2928.0 --> 2933.88
pretty sure they used to be

2930.579 --> 2938.4
but they're not like that anymore

2933.88 --> 2938.4
for for quite a quite some time

2954.28 --> 2961.96
really how does it show you that that

2957.4 --> 2963.88
lot how does a lot show you

2961.96 --> 2966.3
through nature that you're on the

2963.88 --> 2966.3
spinning level

2966.88 --> 2972.579
I mean at some point you're actually

2968.68 --> 2974.859
going to have to involve argumentation

2972.579 --> 2976.78
actual argumentation and not just

2974.859 --> 2980.02
blabbering

2976.78 --> 2984.0600000000004
to just put [ __ ] off so you don't have

2980.02 --> 2984.06
to actually think about it or answer it

2987.52 --> 2991.9
or maybe you don't akumu maybe you never

2990.76 --> 2993.5200000000004
need to

2991.9 --> 2996.28
actually

2993.52 --> 2999.18
think cohesively ever

2996.28 --> 2999.1800000000003
it's up to you

3009.17 --> 3019.26
[Music]

3013.98 --> 3023.04
ever considered military are you nuts

3019.26 --> 3026.6600000000003
if I ever consider that well as a kid I

3023.04 --> 3031.14
kinda did actually wanted to join

3026.66 --> 3034.98
but it was highly recommended against

3031.14 --> 3037.859
by my parents which I'm very glad of

3034.98 --> 3039.359
because it's not trusted and like the

3037.859 --> 3041.0989999999997
first thing they do is just pump you

3039.359 --> 3044.5789999999997
full of vaccines

3041.099 --> 3049.2000000000003
and it's just not gonna happen never

3044.579 --> 3054.2000000000003
I'd rather die as a [ __ ] terrorist

3049.2 --> 3054.2
then then do that for any reason ever

3057.319 --> 3065.599
yeah if I'm gonna be in some military

3059.76 --> 3071.6600000000003
it's gonna be a zero vax military zero

3065.599 --> 3071.6600000000003

3114.3 --> 3120.02
what the [ __ ] is wrong with you

3117.119 --> 3120.02
no they don't

3123.48 --> 3129.42
I mean seriously what vaccine has ever

3126.3 --> 3132.54
saved somebody ever

3129.42 --> 3135.119
according to what it is right that means

3132.54 --> 3137.7599999999998
you take it before you get something I'm

3135.119 --> 3140.46
not talking about oh you're you got it

3137.76 --> 3144.059
you got the condition of something and

3140.46 --> 3146.7
then okay let's inject this India

3144.059 --> 3148.92
to fight it

3146.7 --> 3151.02
to help your condition and then oh yeah

3148.92 --> 3154.26
you might improve right well that's not

3151.02 --> 3156.48
a vaccine polio polio was [ __ ]

3154.26 --> 3159.3
artificially created

3156.48 --> 3163.319
it's literally pollution

3159.3 --> 3166.92
all the polio [ __ ] all of it came from

3163.319 --> 3170.88
vaccines every single case

3166.92 --> 3173.339
polio doesn't even arrive naturally it

3170.88 --> 3176.48
all came from vaccines and from like

3173.339 --> 3176.48
severe pollution

3178.619 --> 3181.339
foreign

3181.4 --> 3186.0
polio is going to make a comeback it's

3183.599 --> 3188.94
because people are poisoning themselves

infectious disease it just isn't

3194.4 --> 3201.5
it's not even a disease it's a condition

3198.0 --> 3201.5
it's not infectious

3202.92 --> 3211.079
you get it it's not infectious how the

3212.28 --> 3217.5
that is not even based on infection this

3215.579 --> 3221.099
is ridiculous

3217.5 --> 3223.68
it's a Pure medical scam

3221.099 --> 3225.839
and it has been from the start from the

3223.68 --> 3229.5589999999997
start of its conception in the early

3225.839 --> 3234.48
20th century it was always a scam from

3229.559 --> 3237.119
the start a murderous Eugenics scam to

3234.48 --> 3239.66
rob people of their money their minds

3237.119 --> 3239.6600000000003
and their health

3241.26 --> 3245.88
all of it the entire medical industry

3244.74 --> 3248.04
like that

3245.88 --> 3250.859
yeah the only thing it was ever good for

3248.04 --> 3254.04
was just like

3250.859 --> 3257.16
surgery medical emergency surgery that

3254.04 --> 3259.98
sort of thing right accidents patching

3257.16 --> 3262.16
up that's the only good there is in

there

3262.74 --> 3268.9199999999996
all the vaccines were always from the

start a scam

3268.92 --> 3274.4
a brutal in your face scam

3275.76 --> 3284.9
from the start it was always a scam from

3280.079 --> 3284.9
the first time it came in the world

3285.3 --> 3289.88
it was never legitimate ever

3295.26 --> 3299.3390000000004
your mother has probably did she get the

I only know people that have polio that

got it through the [ __ ] polio vaccine

3306.96 --> 3312.42
that's the only people I know that

3310.14 --> 3313.7599999999998

3328.859 --> 3333.0789999999997
thing

3330.119 --> 3333.079
it's a scam

3333.9 --> 3342.92
based off the conception that bacteria

3338.04 --> 3346.119
might be infectious which is also a scam

[Music]

3348.8 --> 3356.46
[Music]

3354.0 --> 3359.4
right yes psych there it's all pollution

3356.46 --> 3361.619
based and that includes pollution that

3359.4 --> 3363.859
you literally get injected into your

3361.619 --> 3363.859
body

3369.18 --> 3376.02
polio was wiped up polio was created in

3373.859 --> 3379.14
the USA

3376.02 --> 3381.859
and then it just stopped because it's

3379.14 --> 3385.319
always been created it's always due to

3381.859 --> 3387.319
injections and due to severe pollution

3385.319 --> 3390.119
poison

3387.319 --> 3393.18
causes the condition

3390.119 --> 3395.7000000000003
known as polio which is not even a

3393.18 --> 3399.24
disease it's not infectious nobody's

3395.7 --> 3403.3799999999997
ever been infected by somebody that has

3399.24 --> 3407.2799999999997
the polio condition ever not a single

3403.38 --> 3408.6600000000003
example in [ __ ] history not a single

3407.28 --> 3409.98
example

3408.66 --> 3413.7599999999998
[Music]

3409.98 --> 3416.48
never an infection was involved ever

[Music]

3435.3 --> 3442.88
right welcome virus that's because again

3438.66 --> 3442.8799999999997
it's also because of poison

3444.9 --> 3448.94
psych bear said earlier in chat

3449.28 --> 3454.8
it's likely that DDT and mercuries and

3452.22 --> 3456.359
pesticides were involved which were like

3454.8 --> 3459.54
sprayed

3456.359 --> 3462.0
like including over rural areas where

3459.54 --> 3464.339
people lived right next to the fields

3462.0 --> 3466.76
and they just spray it all over it just

3464.339 --> 3466.7599999999998
go around

3467.76 --> 3472.92
yeah

3469.5 --> 3476.16
that's why I think polio cases typically

3472.92 --> 3478.28
happened in such areas and then almost

3476.16 --> 3480.7799999999997
everybody would get it

3478.28 --> 3483.6600000000003
simultaneously it's not like oh there's

3480.78 --> 3486.3
a polio case oh no oh [ __ ] the infection

3483.66 --> 3489.7799999999997
has spread now suddenly everybody around

3486.3 --> 3495.079
him as it is no no it's just subtly out

of nowhere they all get it yeah poison

[Music]

3502.319 --> 3506.88

3505.26 --> 3509.1600000000003
isn't

3506.88 --> 3510.9
because it's not a disease it's not an

3509.16 --> 3511.98
infection

3510.9 --> 3513.839
yeah

3511.98 --> 3517.88
it's not a virus

3513.839 --> 3521.7799999999997
it's not a bacteria it's poison

3517.88 --> 3521.78
that causes that condition

3530.81 --> 3541.249
[Music]

3552.48 --> 3558.119
what kind of poison is it

3555.54 --> 3560.46
well I don't know specifically but I

3558.119 --> 3563.28
know universally

3560.46 --> 3565.7400000000002
that toxic [ __ ]

3563.28 --> 3568.2000000000003
toxic sludge of any sort

3565.74 --> 3570.299
like which could be like sewer water or

3568.2 --> 3573.18
something right or

3570.299 --> 3576.839
bacterial excretion from Rotting Flesh

3573.18 --> 3581.52
right those types of disgusting things

3576.839 --> 3582.54
are highly toxic and that's how you get

3581.52 --> 3585.599
it

3582.54 --> 3588.0589999999997
like almost anything

3585.599 --> 3589.92
not just polio

3588.059 --> 3594.78
right that's why all these [ __ ]

3589.92 --> 3597.66
vaccines all of them from the start

3594.78 --> 3600.599
always have like

3597.66 --> 3602.94
disgusting rotting [ __ ]

3600.599 --> 3605.6400000000003
and the juices not just isolated

3602.94 --> 3610.46
bacteria or anything nothing isolated

3605.64 --> 3610.46
just scoop a bit of poison in you

3626.339 --> 3628.94
oh

3631.319 --> 3637.38

3710.819 --> 3716.48
it and I don't know maybe you got some

3713.76 --> 3716.48
links or something

3716.819 --> 3721.74
I mean if you're gonna like do a show

3718.799 --> 3723.839
and you happen to like visit my channel

3721.74 --> 3725.339
you can always like say like hey I'm

3723.839 --> 3728.099
doing

3725.339 --> 3729.0
I'm gonna be posting or live streaming a

3728.099 --> 3731.54
show

3729.0 --> 3731.54
later

3733.319 --> 3737.099
and then post that link you can do that

3735.24 --> 3739.319
here

3737.099 --> 3742.98
I like to watch your streams

3739.319 --> 3744.7799999999997
it's very interesting to just see you

3742.98 --> 3747.0
speak Hindi and

3744.78 --> 3748.98
and then still drop like technical

3747.0 --> 3751.2
English words in between which makes it

3748.98 --> 3754.26
like really easy to actually follow what

3751.2 --> 3755.7
you're discussing but it's I'm still

3754.26 --> 3757.6800000000003
amazed by that

3755.7 --> 3760.3799999999997
how that works

3757.68 --> 3763.5789999999997
how easy it is to follow a language that

3760.38 --> 3763.579
I basically do not understand

3763.98 --> 3768.7400000000002
uh anyway welcome to the Stream

3777.059 --> 3784.8190000000004
right this is conventions yes based on

3781.74 --> 3787.74
the bacterial and infection system

3784.819 --> 3791.66
that's why I like to call it conditions

3787.74 --> 3791.66
lva pole I call it condition

3791.76 --> 3796.0200000000004
because there are conditions and they

3794.339 --> 3799.0789999999997
are like that

3796.02 --> 3801.48
and then basically the idea of it being

3799.079 --> 3804.42
caused by a virus or a bacterial

3801.48 --> 3808.22
infection that is like

3804.42 --> 3808.2200000000003
the claim they make about it

3808.799 --> 3814.52
but yeah that's not actually proven

3830.88 --> 3837.299
okay

3833.099 --> 3840.9
oh hey Jose don't tell me to do anything

3837.299 --> 3842.22
yeah you don't order me to do [ __ ] like

3840.9 --> 3845.059
that

3842.22 --> 3845.0589999999997
you can ask

3845.46 --> 3849.2400000000002
but after that

3847.44 --> 3851.819
little statement there I'm definitely

3849.24 --> 3854.66
not gonna do it because I I'm not gonna

3851.819 --> 3854.66
be ordered around

he's not evil but he's just annoying

every time he shows up he's just

3937.14 --> 3941.7
attention grabbing and just creating a

wow

4034.52 --> 4037.839
let me read that out

4038.359 --> 4044.0589999999997
so Neil deGrasse Tyson said we don't

4041.059 --> 4046.579
know where the Dark Matter came from we

4044.059 --> 4050.92
don't know where the expansion expansion

4046.579 --> 4050.92
is happening but we can measure it

4052.7 --> 4058.7799999999997
that's

4054.559 --> 4058.78

no

4106.46 --> 4111.859
Neo is a designated Storyteller he's

4109.46 --> 4114.62
never gonna come clean about Flat Earth

you understand Tara don't be a fool

going to switch to Flat Earth ever even

4128.66 --> 4133.94
if the entire world has converted he's

4131.719 --> 4138.58
not gonna do that

4133.94 --> 4138.58
because he's a designated storyteller

4138.859 --> 4146.179

I mean at best people are just gonna not

4196.82 --> 4201.099999999999
take him serious anymore and just stop

actors contradict themselves yeah but

4231.739 --> 4235.339999999999
that doesn't mean that it's gonna come

4233.3 --> 4237.1990000000005
out

4235.34 --> 4240.7390000000005
and actually start telling the truth

4237.199 --> 4244.4
that's ridiculous do you have a single

4240.739 --> 4248.0599999999995
example of a person in the world in

4248.06 --> 4252.88
tear it you know a singular example

I don't

4257.239 --> 4263.299999999999
because when people like that do that

4260.239 --> 4265.82
they immediately get shoved off to the

sideline and out of the big picture and

4265.82 --> 4271.0
like make everybody forget about them

4267.62 --> 4271.0
that's what happens

4280.3 --> 4286.28
you will meet someone when the camera is

4283.4 --> 4288.139999999999
rolling and they will own

4286.28 --> 4290.3
right there

4288.14 --> 4292.64
well sure

4290.3 --> 4294.1990000000005
is that going to make him stop though I

4292.64 --> 4297.08
mean that's been done with the supposed

4294.199 --> 4300.98
moon landing astronauts and that's

4297.08 --> 4303.679
decades ago even yeah

4300.98 --> 4307.82
did that make them stop

4303.679 --> 4310.28
no no it didn't you can confront Neil

deGrasse Tyson around every [ __ ]

4310.28 --> 4314.96
Street Corner the rest of his [ __ ]

4312.199 --> 4319.219

4314.96 --> 4321.26
you understand ever ever you'd have to

4319.219 --> 4323.4800000000005
kill him

5892.78 --> 5895.659
out there not from Alex Jones but this

is like pure Crystal iodine dissolved in

something else

5903.34 --> 5910.179
this is this is like ideal iodine not

5907.0 --> 5911.86

sorry that this is this is the product

5920.32 --> 5926.0199999999995
that basically made me hold on to Alex

5922.96 --> 5928.86
Jones for like the last

5926.02 --> 5928.860000000001
10 years

5936.52 --> 5941.38
he was the one that actually brought

5938.679 --> 5944.58
this type of form in this way of doing

5941.38 --> 5944.58
it on the market

5949.06 --> 5957.4800000000005
I mean before that there was no such

5952.12 --> 5957.48
product it did not exist he did that

5959.32 --> 5965.0199999999995
I mean that doesn't of course justify

5961.36 --> 5966.639
what he typically tends to do right now

5965.02 --> 5970.38
but

5966.639 --> 5970.38
the product is amazing

5985.54 --> 5991.36
right so yeah PG if you have never tried

5987.94 --> 5993.599999999999

5991.36 --> 5993.599999999999
these

5994.48 --> 5999.78
right nascent iodine in glycerin

that that's how I think

6003.12 --> 6006.08
it works

6011.28 --> 6018.679
yeah vegetable glycerine

6015.06 --> 6018.679
triple distilled water

6020.46 --> 6024.179
yeah that's what

6022.32 --> 6025.719999999999

more iodine Seafoods yeah but the

6120.119 --> 6124.86
problem with seafood and seaweed lva

6123.179 --> 6129.96
Paul is that

6124.86 --> 6133.08
the iodine bearing contained is not pure

6129.96 --> 6134.88
because it's basically collected from

6133.08 --> 6138.239
the ocean

6134.88 --> 6140.159000000001
and the problem is is that well iodine

6138.239 --> 6144.739
binds

6140.159 --> 6144.739
it binds and that's the problem

6145.38 --> 6151.56
and it's bound typically like bound

6148.199 --> 6155.159
binds to Mercury and other [ __ ] and then

6151.56 --> 6156.900000000001
it's just it'll still be usable it's

6155.159 --> 6159.9
just not gonna be as good it's gonna

6156.9 --> 6162.42
have like side effects

6159.9 --> 6166.32
you could take too much of it this one

6162.42 --> 6169.86
is pure it's pure Crystal duck from

6166.32 --> 6171.98

the system for a while

6191.58 --> 6197.4
doesn't matter though lva oh I mean he's

6194.34 --> 6200.52
not a savior if you thought that Alex

you're a [ __ ] [ __ ]

still like a focal point

6216.0 --> 6220.32
through which stuff comes and you it's

6218.699 --> 6222.96
almost like

6220.32 --> 6224.04
you you can use him to basically measure

highly educated and in Innovative people

6246.78 --> 6249.5599999999995

could be no you [ __ ] idiot Aries 106.

lying about the product are the products

6281.34 --> 6286.26
what the [ __ ] is he supposed to be lying

6283.44 --> 6287.82
about yeah he's been selling that sort

6286.26 --> 6290.280000000001
of stuff

6287.82 --> 6294.239
for over a decade

6290.28 --> 6298.28
what a ridiculous conclusion Aries 106

6294.239 --> 6301.5
to say that because he is like playing

6298.28 --> 6303.48
some psychological game with agencies

6301.5 --> 6307.26
and whatever that that means that his

6303.48 --> 6310.5
products are lies too that's the dumbest

6307.26 --> 6314.84
[ __ ] thing I've ever heard

6310.5 --> 6314.84
either the products work or they don't

6315.239 --> 6320.299999999999
and they do

6316.56 --> 6320.3
the ones that I've gotten anyway

6321.659 --> 6326.58
I mean I wouldn't like want every

6324.119 --> 6329.099999999999
freaking product that he sells

6326.58 --> 6332.76
but there's just a couple of key things

6329.1 --> 6334.4400000000005
that are really really good and I've

6332.76 --> 6339.06
tested them

6334.44 --> 6344.159
for years use them for years

6339.06 --> 6346.92
not fake not lying about the products

6344.159 --> 6350.94
yeah having deals

6346.92 --> 6353.28
with agencies like NASA or whatever is

6350.94 --> 6354.239
out there military industrial complex

6353.28 --> 6356.0
even

6354.239 --> 6359.638999999999
sure

6356.0 --> 6362.58
that doesn't make his products a lie and

6359.639 --> 6364.08
poison that's [ __ ] it's the dumbest

6362.58 --> 6368.42
[ __ ] thing I've ever heard to say

6364.08 --> 6368.42
Aries 106. really it is

6380.34 --> 6385.02
yeah to add bad reviews they had bad

6382.92 --> 6387.6
reviews if the products were [ __ ] then

6385.02 --> 6391.8
it would be widely known that their [ __ ]

6387.6 --> 6393.659000000001
they're not [ __ ] they're good

6391.8 --> 6395.76
right that doesn't mean that everything

6393.659 --> 6397.08
that comes out of Alex's mouth is the

6395.76 --> 6400.26
true

6397.08 --> 6403.08
or is he even cohesive

6400.26 --> 6405.54
but the products are good and there are

6403.08 --> 6407.5199999999995
some big brains

6405.54 --> 6410.699
pharmacist brains

6407.52 --> 6413.6990000000005
that have helped to concoct them

6410.699 --> 6416.28
in that on that level yes like a

6413.699 --> 6418.259999999999
standard to uphold ironically he has a

6416.28 --> 6421.32
product standard to uphold even though

6418.26 --> 6423.780000000001
like what comes out of his mouth

6421.32 --> 6426.78
is

6423.78 --> 6430.259999999999
plenty of times complete horror [ __ ]

6426.78 --> 6433.08
comes out of his product is not

6430.26 --> 6434.88
I mean it would be over very quickly if

6433.08 --> 6437.88
it was by the way

6434.88 --> 6441.96
very quickly they've tried

6437.88 --> 6445.26
yeah move left liberal people have

6441.96 --> 6447.92
literally tried the smear and sue him

6445.26 --> 6451.26
for products not working

6447.92 --> 6453.659
it it didn't work out

6451.26 --> 6457.400000000001
because they do work and it was all made

6453.659 --> 6457.4
up lies and slander

6458.52 --> 6463.26
yeah and you Aries 106 saying what you

6462.48 --> 6467.599999999999
did

6463.26 --> 6467.6
is part of that slander

6470.04 --> 6474.48
it's ridiculous

6472.98 --> 6478.678999999999

6531.179 --> 6536.4400000000005
it's just become a compulsive

6533.699 --> 6538.259999999999
blabber mouthing lying ass

6536.44 --> 6541.699
[Music]

6538.26 --> 6541.6990000000005
and just has to do that

6543.36 --> 6549.719
right in between the times where he is

6545.76 --> 6553.26
actually quite focused and reserved and

6549.719 --> 6555.679
more inspired to be a little bit more

6553.26 --> 6555.679
serious

6557.1 --> 6563.6990000000005
and reserved

6560.1 --> 6566.780000000001
but yeah the moments in between that are

6563.699 --> 6570.919999999999
becoming bigger and bigger and

6566.78 --> 6570.92
if he even comes on

6574.38 --> 6580.56
but yeah there's a lot of Infowars crew

6577.38 --> 6582.7390000000005
that I do like that are not acting like

6580.56 --> 6582.7390000000005
that

6582.96 --> 6588.8
or at least not yet I don't know how

6586.139 --> 6588.8
long that will last

6607.5 --> 6611.9
hey Charlie and Cat good to see you

6609.78 --> 6611.9
again

6627.3 --> 6630.96
problems they portray him like I

6629.34 --> 6636.32
represent yeah but that's the whole

6630.96 --> 6636.32
point PGC net that's the whole point

6637.08 --> 6639.619
foreign

6640.139 --> 6646.9800000000005
what is the best form to control

6643.56 --> 6651.360000000001
opposition is to be the opposition and

6646.98 --> 6654.119
then show them doing the worst things

6651.36 --> 6656.88
being Liars being hypocritical being

6654.119 --> 6659.719
petty

6656.88 --> 6662.46
because what more can basically

6659.719 --> 6666.6
demotivate any youth

6662.46 --> 6668.4
to actually rise up then some bloaty

6666.6 --> 6671.400000000001
[ __ ]

6668.4 --> 6674.96
who just constantly lies and claims that

6671.4 --> 6674.96
he's the tip of the spear

6683.04 --> 6689.42
right and I wonder if Alex is even aware

6687.0 --> 6693.679
of that consciously that he is

6689.42 --> 6693.679
fulfilling that specific role

6693.719 --> 6697.619
I think he is just trying to be

6695.58 --> 6699.48
attention grabby I don't think he's even

6697.619 --> 6703.199
about cohesion anymore he's just about

6699.48 --> 6707.759999999999
attention grabbing that's all

6703.199 --> 6710.46
foreign I I think Alex at this point may

6707.76 --> 6712.92
actually be clinically psychotic in the

6710.46 --> 6715.44
sense that he literally cannot

6712.92 --> 6718.38
stop

6715.44 --> 6721.32
doing what he does and like can no

6718.38 --> 6723.4800000000005
longer attain a true grip on reality I

6721.32 --> 6725.759999999999
think he's come to that point when I

6723.48 --> 6728.879999999999
look at him and his activities now

6725.76 --> 6730.860000000001
that's what I see I see somebody that is

6728.88 --> 6732.139
more and more and more sliding into

6730.86 --> 6734.219
complete

6732.139 --> 6736.88
psychosis because of his own

6734.219 --> 6736.88
Fabrications

6739.98 --> 6744.678999999999
and his own narratives that he is

6742.08 --> 6744.679
pushing out

6746.1 --> 6753.360000000001
he lost it having that Tate guy on I

6749.76 --> 6754.92
noticed that yes very disgusting I

6753.36 --> 6757.98
didn't even know who the [ __ ] that Tate

6754.92 --> 6760.8
guy was but just seeing him hearing him

6757.98 --> 6763.138999999999
made me instantly hate him I did not

6760.8 --> 6767.0
know anything about him I just knew this

6763.139 --> 6770.34
guy is a [ __ ] disgusting scumbag

6767.0 --> 6773.639
instantly I did not know anything about

6770.34 --> 6776.04
this [ __ ] tape just saw him that one

6773.639 --> 6778.32
time and immediately knew that guy is

6776.04 --> 6780.239
[ __ ] disgusting

6778.32 --> 6781.98

6780.239 --> 6786.259999999999
evil

6781.98 --> 6786.259999999999
really [ __ ] evil

6791.78 --> 6798.78
AKA gave in and joined the Bohemian Club

6796.139 --> 6802.08
I don't know maybe he did

6798.78 --> 6804.48
maybe he is now part of the club just to

6802.08 --> 6806.04
spy on them maybe that's what he thinks

6804.48 --> 6808.86
he's doing

6806.04 --> 6812.28
or maybe that's now just the excuse left

6808.86 --> 6815.04
for him to just do that

6812.28 --> 6817.28
so yeah maybe he did join the Bohemian

6815.04 --> 6817.28
Club

6817.739 --> 6822.678999999999
I mean laugh it up it could absolutely

be true

[Music]

6830.159 --> 6836.099999999999
he's becoming psychotic but at least he

6832.56 --> 6837.54
makes no he doesn't make it Ares 106. he

6836.1 --> 6840.0
just sells it

6837.54 --> 6843.42
he's not a labyrinth

6840.0 --> 6844.739
he did not make that stuff

6843.42 --> 6847.88
yeah

6844.739 --> 6847.879999999999
I know who did

6848.04 --> 6850.88
what's his name again

6850.98 --> 6856.44
Dr group

6853.08 --> 6859.619
who went on with Alex Jones like in 2010

6856.44 --> 6861.178999999999
especially that guy is [ __ ] smart and

6859.619 --> 6863.58
he knows

6861.179 --> 6865.4400000000005
he knows what's real and what isn't

6863.58 --> 6867.84
knows it very well and he stays out of

6865.44 --> 6869.219
it he's too smart to get involved in

6867.84 --> 6871.679
that sort of [ __ ]

6869.219 --> 6874.44
but he fabricated the method to make

6871.679 --> 6877.26
that iodine and it is the purest in the

it is

6879.179 --> 6883.92
unmatched

6880.92 --> 6885.96
right and just because Alex's mind is

6883.92 --> 6888.179
not pure doesn't mean that the product

6885.96 --> 6891.119
he sold sells

6888.179 --> 6894.84
and that he originally procured

6891.119 --> 6896.639
to be designed for him than in store

6894.84 --> 6899.34
doesn't mean that just because he is

6896.639 --> 6901.86
impure in spirit that his product is in

6899.34 --> 6904.639
PR in quality

6901.86 --> 6904.639

7465.199 --> 7471.339999999999
it's so important that we're all

7467.659 --> 7471.339999999999
tolerant and peaceful oh yes

7471.82 --> 7475.36
they're controlled

7476.02 --> 7483.080000000001
Republicans are marxists

7480.199 --> 7484.5199999999995
they're traitors they're traitors to the

7483.08 --> 7486.8
people

7484.52 --> 7489.320000000001
just like the left

7486.8 --> 7493.28
liberals but they're like honest about

7489.32 --> 7496.04
it they're just psychotic nuvarish

7493.28 --> 7497.9
want to be nobility that are like taking

7496.04 --> 7501.86
the reins and just saying like uh

7497.9 --> 7503.36
whatever I say is Rule yeah but they're

7501.86 --> 7505.04
open about it

7503.36 --> 7508.339999999999
they're open about how [ __ ]

7505.04 --> 7512.179
dictatorial they are the Republicans are

7508.34 --> 7515.360000000001
there to oh yes oh we're we're we could

7512.179 --> 7518.0
still make it guys we can beat the

7515.36 --> 7520.339999999999
Communists even though we are communists

7518.0 --> 7522.56
but yeah we're still pretending like

7520.34 --> 7525.38
we're not and you're stupid enough to

7522.56 --> 7527.54
fall in it yeah you're stupid enough to

7525.38 --> 7530.54
believe it

7527.54 --> 7530.54

[Music]

7544.78 --> 7550.0
I know that image oops sorry one Aries

7552.86 --> 7558.799999999999
that's right Aries 106 correct today you

7556.52 --> 7563.8
learn that American Republicans are

7558.8 --> 7563.8
pro-gay communists that's correct

7564.099 --> 7569.2390000000005
let it sink

7566.3 --> 7572.84
beg if you it's gonna get worse it's

7569.239 --> 7575.9
gonna get so much worse I mean they are

7572.84 --> 7577.159000000001
moving towards a Sodom and Gomorrah

7575.9 --> 7581.598999999999
scenario

7577.159 --> 7584.179
I mean they want that yeah communists

7581.599 --> 7585.860000000001
you know what they want to destroy

7584.179 --> 7589.159
everything

7585.86 --> 7592.759999999999
they want to just kill everyone

7589.159 --> 7595.719
Satan Communists communism

7592.76 --> 7599.4800000000005
you know what the root is Satan

7595.719 --> 7601.52
communism's root is Satan lies lies

7599.48 --> 7603.259999999999
about everything lies about everything

7601.52 --> 7607.88
on every scale

7603.26 --> 7610.099
and the ultimate lie is yes let's just

7607.88 --> 7612.26
destroy everything

7610.099 --> 7615.38
let's take away all their power let's

7612.26 --> 7617.719
erase it let's make them all demented

7615.38 --> 7619.58
and that's not gonna make it stop though

7617.719 --> 7620.9
because they're just one more and more

7619.58 --> 7623.9
and more until

7620.9 --> 7626.299999999999
eventually the imagery starts to appear

7623.9 --> 7628.759999999999
of that giant pile of skulls with a

7626.3 --> 7631.46
throne on it and they want to be on that

7628.76 --> 7634.96
Throne that's what communism does

7631.46 --> 7634.96
but it's always done

7637.28 --> 7643.659
with the Netherlands government how

7639.38 --> 7648.9400000000005
could I categorize it very similar

7643.659 --> 7648.94
very similar but also slightly different

7649.04 --> 7655.219
I mean the system we even have here is

7652.04 --> 7657.44
different there is no two-party system

7655.219 --> 7660.139
but there's a whole bunch of main

7657.44 --> 7662.0599999999995
parties the cabal it is literally a

7660.139 --> 7664.400000000001
cabal it is a group of conspiring

7662.06 --> 7666.26
parties that all synchronize they

7664.4 --> 7668.179
function as one party

7666.26 --> 7669.9800000000005
when it comes down to it and they're

7668.179 --> 7673.76
super political

7669.98 --> 7675.5599999999995
an anti-human anti-people like they

7673.76 --> 7678.92
don't care about the rights of people

7675.56 --> 7681.1990000000005
they don't they just claim they do to

7678.92 --> 7683.4800000000005
appeal to emotions

7681.199 --> 7685.159
because they don't care anything about

7683.48 --> 7686.959999999999
the people they're communist

7685.159 --> 7689.96
infiltrators and they should all get

7686.96 --> 7693.34
that death penalty

7689.96 --> 7693.34
for what they're doing now

7694.91 --> 7698.96
[Music]

7696.199 --> 7701.5599999999995
yeah and there's a very few exceptions

7698.96 --> 7701.56
to this

7702.44 --> 7707.96
I don't know if

7704.96 --> 7710.3
forum for democracy which is really like

7707.96 --> 7712.46
the counterparty and I've been following

7710.3 --> 7714.619000000001
it pretty closely I think that they

7712.46 --> 7716.659
might actually be the real thing and not

7714.619 --> 7718.759999999999
a controlled opposition I really hope so

7716.659 --> 7721.5199999999995
because otherwise

7718.76 --> 7723.8
just [ __ ] nuke the country already

7721.52 --> 7726.38
because I don't want to even know about

7723.8 --> 7729.860000000001
it anymore then just destroy it then if

7726.38 --> 7733.34
that's not the case please please

7729.86 --> 7737.08
Russia please send one of your big bombs

7733.34 --> 7737.08
and just wipe us out then

7738.32 --> 7742.58
but I think that form for democracy is

7741.02 --> 7745.159000000001
actually attempting

7742.58 --> 7747.5
to get them out because they say it

7745.159 --> 7749.719
they're saying it literally like these

7747.5 --> 7751.34
are enemies of the country they're

7749.719 --> 7755.26
infiltrators they're traitors they're

7751.34 --> 7755.26
Liars they're they steal money

7756.199 --> 7761.598999999999
they break the law everywhere they go

7759.38 --> 7765.1990000000005
and they want them out and I want them

7761.599 --> 7768.02
out so I'm gonna go for the time being

7765.199 --> 7770.119
the notion that forum for democracy is

7768.02 --> 7772.400000000001
not a controlled opposition communist

7770.119 --> 7775.159
treacherous party that's just there to

7772.4 --> 7779.0599999999995
keep us busy while the Communists take

7775.159 --> 7781.4
over and absolutely eradicate us

7779.06 --> 7783.6990000000005
never know how long that's gonna last

7781.4 --> 7783.699
though

7783.739 --> 7788.598999999999
because the problem is how the [ __ ] are

7786.619 --> 7790.759999999999
we gonna replace all this [ __ ] you know

7788.599 --> 7791.54
how many people are corrupted in our

7790.76 --> 7793.9400000000005
government

7791.54 --> 7795.86
the majority

7793.94 --> 7798.799999999999
do you understand

7795.86 --> 7801.259999999999
the majority of the people in government

7798.8 --> 7804.4400000000005
here in the Netherlands is corrupted

7801.26 --> 7806.4800000000005
like provably not American style

7804.44 --> 7808.219
corrupted because that's just

7806.48 --> 7812.239
immeasurable

7808.219 --> 7814.28
and normalized but it's bad enough that

7812.239 --> 7816.138999999999
it's going to be a massive problem to

7814.28 --> 7818.48
replace all this

7816.139 --> 7820.84
because it's like half the government is

7818.48 --> 7823.58
literally so corrupted that they're

7820.84 --> 7825.619000000001
anti-netherlands like they don't give a

7823.58 --> 7828.139
[ __ ] anymore they're just there for

7825.619 --> 7829.58
their own power that's the only thing

7828.139 --> 7832.82
they care about

7829.58 --> 7834.86
like these people are very satisfied to

7832.82 --> 7837.38
literally have all the food and energy

7834.86 --> 7840.259999999999
in the world while they literally see

7837.38 --> 7843.26
people starve to death on the streets

7840.26 --> 7845.84
around them they're like that

7843.26 --> 7849.139
they're monsters and they need to be

7845.84 --> 7852.400000000001
removed and executed

7849.139 --> 7852.400000000001
for treason

7852.62 --> 7862.26
[Music]

7859.94 --> 7871.409
getting really hungry now

7862.26 --> 7871.409000000001
[Music]

7874.099 --> 7877.719
what the [ __ ] are you talking about

7878.179 --> 7885.159
no no government is great it just needs

7882.02 --> 7885.159000000001
to not be like this

7887.96 --> 7892.94
right but there's a big chance that the

7890.239 --> 7895.759999999999
Netherlands is after this [ __ ] is going

7892.94 --> 7898.638999999999
to transition into a republic

7895.76 --> 7902.3
it's a big chance

7898.639 --> 7904.400000000001
I kind of hoped that maybe the nobility

7902.3 --> 7906.860000000001
here would see some kind of reason and

7904.4 --> 7908.0599999999995
get out of it but no they're with the

7906.86 --> 7909.799999999999
Devil

7908.06 --> 7913.900000000001
so it's over

7909.8 --> 7913.900000000001
they can all [ __ ] go kill themselves

7913.94 --> 7919.699
I mean [ __ ] you [ __ ] you and [ __ ] your

7917.719 --> 7920.93
policies and [ __ ] your connections and

7919.699 --> 7925.5199999999995
[ __ ] your conspiracies

7920.93 --> 7928.099
[Music]

7925.52 --> 7930.5
I'm not gonna

7928.099 --> 7934.119000000001
like shed a single tear if they

7930.5 --> 7934.119
literally just got executed

7935.179 --> 7940.159
at this point

7937.94 --> 7941.32
because they're openly against the

7940.159 --> 7945.138999999999
people

7941.32 --> 7947.299999999999
openly for the lies Eugenics agenda

7945.139 --> 7950.78
they're lying about everything they're

7947.3 --> 7953.2390000000005
investing it and all they are criminals

7950.78 --> 7956.0599999999995
like not criminals that are just trying

7953.239 --> 7957.919999999999
to save their position and then to do it

7956.06 --> 7960.02
again like

7957.92 --> 7961.88
try to manage the country some no

7960.02 --> 7965.4800000000005
they're literally just parasitic

7961.88 --> 7968.659000000001
criminals at this point that are openly

7965.48 --> 7969.799999999999
siding with conspirators against the

7968.659 --> 7971.78
people

7969.8 --> 7975.099
to kill them

7971.78 --> 7975.099
they're traitors

7980.84 --> 7984.139
[Music]

7982.159 --> 7988.54
no governments will not always be

7984.139 --> 7988.54
corrupted that's not true lva Paul

7990.679 --> 7994.6990000000005
they always risk corruption that's part

7993.56 --> 7996.5
of the deal

7994.699 --> 7998.36
problem is is that when you don't

7996.5 --> 8000.28
address the corruption that's when it

7998.36 --> 8002.92
gets so bad

8000.28 --> 8005.44
it cannot be restored

8002.92 --> 8007.599
well in the Netherlands there has been a

8005.44 --> 8010.9
tradition for a very long time very

8007.599 --> 8013.0
Dutch tradition to be extremely against

8010.9 --> 8015.339999999999
government corruption and they would

8013.0 --> 8016.9
like literally not get let anybody get

8015.34 --> 8018.46
away with it even if they've done a

8016.9 --> 8020.5
great job

8018.46 --> 8024.099
right

8020.5 --> 8026.619
and that has seemed to change and that

8024.099 --> 8028.900000000001
is devastating because that's like the

8026.619 --> 8030.94
one thing that we did

8028.9 --> 8033.879999999999
to prevent the government from

8030.94 --> 8036.879999999999
corrupting has basically happened

8033.88 --> 8040.36
in like the last few years

8036.88 --> 8042.46
which is a massive Shock by the way I

8040.36 --> 8044.44
mean yeah government was always a bit

8042.46 --> 8046.9
dubious and all that and like these

8044.44 --> 8049.78
figures are like where are you going why

8046.9 --> 8051.46
are you doing that right but now it's

8049.78 --> 8054.099
just

8051.46 --> 8058.0
yeah the veil is off

8054.099 --> 8060.219
it's people know now like this is a

8058.0 --> 8062.56
corrupted group

8060.219 --> 8064.96
they have been borrow it borrowing

8062.56 --> 8067.599
themselves in for a while and now

8064.96 --> 8071.079
they're fully exposed

8067.599 --> 8073.0
and people are seething I mean you think

8071.079 --> 8076.239
that I can get pissed off

8073.0 --> 8079.06
there's people out there

8076.239 --> 8084.178999999999
that are literally ready to bash heads

8079.06 --> 8084.179
in not in their minds but actually

8086.079 --> 8092.86
because they know this is like World War

8088.659 --> 8094.0
II we're being invaded but not by an

8092.86 --> 8097.239
army

8094.0 --> 8098.5
over the borders but by the people in

8097.239 --> 8101.379999999999
the government

8098.5 --> 8102.579
or being invaded they know it they feel

8101.38 --> 8105.219
it

8102.579 --> 8107.5599999999995
and they're ready they're ready to bust

8105.219 --> 8109.43
some heads and it is probably going to

8107.56 --> 8112.179
happen at some point

8109.43 --> 8116.099
