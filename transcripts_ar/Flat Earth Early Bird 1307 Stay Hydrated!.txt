that's doing it

147.2 --> 152.48
the sort of clear skies but i don't know

149.84 --> 154.64000000000001
not really

152.48 --> 157.11999999999998
there were trails there were plenty of

154.64 --> 158.95899999999997
chemtrails or

157.12 --> 160.31900000000002
whatever trails

158.959 --> 162.56
out there

160.319 --> 164.95899999999997
but they kind of like haze out they

162.56 --> 166.64000000000001
hazed out quickly

164.959 --> 167.76
but yeah at the horizon you can still

166.64 --> 170.55999999999997
see that

167.76 --> 172.72
it's kind of grayish

170.56 --> 175.36
but yeah it's not enough to stop the sun

172.72 --> 177.599
i can tell you that

175.36 --> 177.59900000000002
so

179.2 --> 182.76

yeah

209.519 --> 216.4
yeah yeah though

212.319 --> 218.56
was the data from my last email enough

216.4 --> 220.56
because jetta has been

218.56 --> 222.319
trying to just do a bank transfer but

220.56 --> 226.0
you need all this

222.319 --> 227.35999999999999
data to do that internationally

226.0 --> 230.0
i think

227.36 --> 231.68

230.0 --> 233.12
shadow

231.68 --> 235.20000000000002
uh

233.12 --> 237.04
i mean communication just through the

235.2 --> 240.04
chats a lot quicker

237.04 --> 240.04
uh

241.04 --> 247.72
it is monday the 18th of july 2022

248.82 --> 251.88
[Music]

254.319 --> 257.599
30 degrees celsius

259.919 --> 262.479
but

261.199 --> 263.36
poof

262.479 --> 266.479
yeah

263.36 --> 266.47900000000004
might even get hotter

267.12 --> 273.12
and tomorrow 37 degrees now so it is

269.6 --> 275.84000000000003
kind of like moving around

273.12 --> 278.96
the temperature predictions

275.84 --> 280.15999999999997
anyway i got plenty of water i got

278.96 --> 282.479
cooler

280.16 --> 284.56
cooled water which is like the best idea

282.479 --> 286.56
ever i filled it up then put it in the

284.56 --> 288.32
cooler

286.56 --> 290.0
in the night and so it's just nice and

288.32 --> 293.199
cool

290.0 --> 295.6
for groceries also i got just this free

293.199 --> 297.12
paper water

295.6 --> 299.52000000000004
bottle

297.12 --> 301.68
with mineral water just got it for free

299.52 --> 306.24
it's really nice and it's interesting

301.68 --> 306.24
because i can compare what it's like

309.199 --> 313.44
compared to my

310.88 --> 316.15999999999997
ceramic filtered water

313.44 --> 319.28
and i have to tell you

316.16 --> 319.28000000000003
my water is better

321.759 --> 324.88
like

322.96 --> 328.479
yummy

324.88 --> 330.71999999999997
it's funny to compare that but yeah

328.479 --> 333.039
ceramic filtered water tastes a lot

330.72 --> 333.03900000000004
better

333.6 --> 336.0
all right

336.56 --> 344.479
anyhow how are you doing it's cooking

341.199 --> 344.479
over there in england too

349.039 --> 353.84
and in india it's always cooking in

351.12 --> 353.84000000000003
summer so

360.319 --> 365.03900000000004
yeah that's right we just seen it that's

362.24 --> 366.8
why my show today's just stay hydrated

365.039 --> 369.199
because it's

366.8 --> 371.759
it's really important like especially

369.199 --> 374.319
when there is not a lot of wind

371.759 --> 376.24
you're gonna sweat a lot if you then

374.319 --> 378.639
don't have water with you and you like

376.24 --> 381.36
think like oh i'm gonna

378.639 --> 383.039
go out for an hour outside

381.36 --> 385.199
and you don't you don't have water with

383.039 --> 388.71999999999997
it yeah then in an hour you're gonna get

385.199 --> 388.72
super dehydrated i think

389.68 --> 395.319
it's decent today okay okay tear it

395.6 --> 401.88
by india

397.12 --> 401.88
standards that's probably true

409.28 --> 413.11999999999995
it's monday night did i say sunday i

411.44 --> 415.759
didn't say sunday

413.12 --> 415.759

417.84 --> 420.63899999999995
right

419.68 --> 423.28000000000003
huh

420.639 --> 425.84000000000003
okay well if i said sunday that's weird

423.28 --> 428.84
it must be the heat

425.84 --> 428.84
anyhow

437.759 --> 440.08000000000004
right

442.4 --> 447.4

455.039 --> 460.15999999999997
oh starting time is yeah i know i know

458.319 --> 461.599
yeah i'm just starting an hour late

460.16 --> 464.40000000000003
because it's

461.599 --> 466.15999999999997
it was just too hot and i

464.4 --> 469.75899999999996
kind of went out for groceries because

466.16 --> 472.16
like the paypal money finally came in

469.759 --> 475.16
and so i had this like stock up on some

472.16 --> 475.16
stuff

478.56 --> 482.639
but yeah that took a little longer than

480.639 --> 485.69
i expected anyway and it was still like

482.639 --> 487.199
super hot in here so i kind of just

485.69 --> 488.56
[Music]

[Music]

769.44 --> 772.44

2010

781.92 --> 786.4799999999999
it's

783.76 --> 790.16
really an intense movie

786.48 --> 793.04
and like very dark but like dark and

790.16 --> 795.279
emotional very in your face

793.04 --> 796.959
so that was quite a trip i think i might

795.279 --> 799.04
have seen it before

796.959 --> 801.1199999999999
but

799.04 --> 802.88
yeah i watched it again if that's the

801.12 --> 804.079
case and

802.88 --> 808.92
man

804.079 --> 808.92
that movie is freaking heavy

815.76 --> 821.12
right there wasn't really much flat

818.639 --> 824.0790000000001
earth activity yesterday

821.12 --> 824.079
online that is

825.76 --> 831.68
although yeah there was john thor

829.04 --> 834.3199999999999
did upload a hilarious owen benjamin

831.68 --> 836.7199999999999
video or rather of multiple

834.32 --> 840.24
he like put them all together

836.72 --> 843.36
all these mountain bear cartoons

840.24 --> 847.92
concerning nasa basically using

843.36 --> 850.0790000000001
astronaut and nasa employee voice overs

847.92 --> 852.56
over those cartoons and it is hilarious

850.079 --> 856.4799999999999
so check that out if you haven't already

852.56 --> 856.4799999999999
that was pretty much the latter thing

856.959 --> 862.8
and

859.199 --> 862.8
quantum of conscience also had

862.959 --> 867.1199999999999
like about the

864.8 --> 869.5999999999999
the fake reality another video on free

867.12 --> 872.5600000000001
voice dot io

869.6 --> 872.5600000000001
was really good

874.88 --> 880.56
very revealing like how bad it really is

878.24 --> 883.04
like putting all the fake

880.56 --> 884.4799999999999
media stuff all together and the crisis

883.04 --> 887.36
acting in

884.48 --> 889.36
pretty intense video as well

887.36 --> 892.36
well worth watching if you haven't

889.36 --> 892.36
already

897.73 --> 900.919
[Music]

923.04 --> 926.12
all right

927.68 --> 930.3199999999999
talk about

932.72 --> 935.759
let me browse around

936.399 --> 942.959
i'm not going to talk about cats again

938.16 --> 944.48
today yesterday was very casual show

942.959 --> 948.16
it was kind of interesting though i did

944.48 --> 948.16
get some interesting comments as well

950.959 --> 956.4799999999999
from stonewonkey3d about the demo scene

954.56 --> 958.88
that it's still going

956.48 --> 958.88
out there

961.759 --> 968.0
also yeah i got a playlist but then from

965.04 --> 969.36
somebody in chat with like amiga 500

968.0 --> 971.36
music

969.36 --> 973.759
and that was kind of interesting

971.36 --> 977.6
although like in that entire list i

973.759 --> 979.92
literally only knew one game from that

977.6 --> 979.9200000000001
one

980.959 --> 987.68
and to be fair i was not super impressed

984.48 --> 989.9200000000001
i mean there's a lot of amiga 500 games

987.68 --> 992.0
a lot of them

989.92 --> 996.92
but

992.0 --> 996.92
like they are kind of like

998.16 --> 1003.04
i don't know

999.839 --> 1004.8000000000001
not super impressive like they're okay

1003.04 --> 1006.56
they were pretty good for the time being

1004.8 --> 1008.399
like i thought better than the average

1006.56 --> 1011.04
pc game at least it's just that the

1008.399 --> 1012.0
amiga 1200 games that's when things are

1011.04 --> 1013.4399999999999
like

1012.0 --> 1016.079
unfortunately there aren't even that

1013.44 --> 1019.6
many of them compared to the 500s

1016.079 --> 1021.7589999999999
but those games are like really

1019.6 --> 1023.839
another level

1021.759 --> 1026.16
and my favorite games from them i posted

1023.839 --> 1027.6000000000001
link to music of it though it's not even

1026.16 --> 1030.3190000000002
complete

1027.6 --> 1032.3999999999999
it's like super stardust

1030.319 --> 1034.72
and

1032.4 --> 1039.199
rocket z by the way rocket c is

1034.72 --> 1041.1200000000001
literally my desktop background picture

1039.199 --> 1043.28
since i had a

1041.12 --> 1045.4389999999999
the option of uploading a background

1043.28 --> 1048.0
picture i used that because it's just

1045.439 --> 1051.799
that's the game i probably paid played

1048.0 --> 1051.799
the most ever

1055.2 --> 1060.0800000000002
because it's like i played that game

1056.96 --> 1063.039
with friends a lot and it was really

1060.08 --> 1064.96
good at it like really freaking it's so

1063.039 --> 1066.799
good that like

1064.96 --> 1068.4
my friends eventually kind of stopped

1066.799 --> 1070.32
liking it

1068.4 --> 1072.799
because it was just to i used my

1070.32 --> 1075.28
intuition and stuff to like be able to

1072.799 --> 1076.799
predict like outside of my screen what

1075.28 --> 1078.6399999999999
would happen

1076.799 --> 1079.679
and it got so good at it it was just

1078.64 --> 1080.96
crazy

1079.679 --> 1082.64
surreal

1080.96 --> 1086.0
i had a lot of good memories of that

1082.64 --> 1089.1200000000001
game very awesome music very typical

1086.0 --> 1090.64
amiga 1200 sounds and that's what i love

1089.12 --> 1092.559
that sound

1090.64 --> 1095.2
right the other music from like the

1092.559 --> 1098.559
amiga 500 games were really not that

1095.2 --> 1099.8400000000001
super impressive they really were not

1098.559 --> 1102.48
they're like

1099.84 --> 1104.799
a little better than commodore 64 in my

1102.48 --> 1108.0
opinion and by the way commodore 64 has

1104.799 --> 1110.48
really awesome songs so

1108.0 --> 1110.48
but uh

1113.039 --> 1116.72
strong still on the up really

1116.799 --> 1120.4
but

1118.16 --> 1120.4
like

1121.28 --> 1126.16
are are those amigas even still working

1123.919 --> 1129.039
or are they being rebuilt or something

1126.16 --> 1132.0
because i used to have an amiga 1200

1129.039 --> 1133.679
and then it just broke really really

1132.0 --> 1134.48
totally

1133.679 --> 1136.96
like

1134.48 --> 1138.08
i had the amiga equivalent of a blue

1136.96 --> 1140.4
screen

1138.08 --> 1142.559
and it has like four stages and if you

1140.4 --> 1145.039
like have the last stage it's like a red

1142.559 --> 1147.76
screen then like the hardware itself is

1145.039 --> 1147.76
just toast

1148.08 --> 1152.72
so

1149.2 --> 1155.28
i mean amiga 1200s like have been out of

1152.72 --> 1159.559
production for what is it

1155.28 --> 1159.559
25 years or something

1164.32 --> 1166.1599999999999
like

1165.12 --> 1167.84
yeah

1166.16 --> 1170.96
i mean it's cool and all and of course

1167.84 --> 1173.4399999999998
you can like do it on a pc

1170.96 --> 1174.88
still you can yeah upload those games on

1173.44 --> 1177.919
an emulator

1174.88 --> 1179.6000000000001
but like an actual amiga computer like

1177.919 --> 1181.5200000000002
those things i don't know if they're

1179.6 --> 1185.12
still even around they must be pretty

1181.52 --> 1189.6399999999999
rare by now because they'll just break

1185.12 --> 1189.6399999999999
if you use them long enough

1190.52 --> 1193.559
[Music]

1193.6 --> 1197.84
it's really funny by the way because an

1195.12 --> 1200.2399999999998
amiga 1200 is basically like a really

1197.84 --> 1202.559
large keyboard that is the computer the

1200.24 --> 1204.24
computer is the keyboard it is very

1202.559 --> 1205.12
similar to the

1204.24 --> 1207.52
uh

1205.12 --> 1209.6789999999999
through the commodore 64 model

1207.52 --> 1212.32
which was that as well except that the

1209.679 --> 1213.44
commodore 64 was like much bulkier like

1212.32 --> 1216.3999999999999
fat

1213.44 --> 1218.559
and the amiga 1200 was like wider and

1216.4 --> 1220.799
slimmer it was incredible that it all

1218.559 --> 1223.12
fitted in that one computer

1220.799 --> 1223.12
anyway

1225.52 --> 1230.6399999999999
a re-pop

1228.32 --> 1230.6399999999999
what

1232.84 --> 1237.84
okay well i guess that by now with the

1235.84 --> 1240.6399999999999
technology that it's that's around you

1237.84 --> 1241.76
could probably like even

1240.64 --> 1242.64
just

1241.76 --> 1246.36
make

1242.64 --> 1246.3600000000001
an amiga 1200.

1248.08 --> 1251.84
is that what repop means is like that

1250.24 --> 1254.48
you take the

1251.84 --> 1256.08
the outside of it

1254.48 --> 1258.159
and that you just like

1256.08 --> 1259.52
put a completely new thing inside of

1258.159 --> 1263.0390000000002
there i mean

1259.52 --> 1266.559
amiga 1200 could probably like

1263.039 --> 1266.559
that those are like less

1266.96 --> 1271.28
less complicated than the average mobile

1269.12 --> 1272.7199999999998
phone right

1271.28 --> 1275.72
reproduced

1272.72 --> 1275.72
huh

1276.08 --> 1278.32
cool

1286.159 --> 1291.7990000000002
yeah that's pretty cool

1288.799 --> 1291.799
anyway

1296.799 --> 1299.52
what the

1298.27 --> 1303.0
[Music]

1299.52 --> 1303.0
hell was that

1308.88 --> 1312.679
[ __ ] the edges here

1320.799 --> 1324.24
that was weird

1322.88 --> 1328.48
i heard like

1324.24 --> 1328.48
some kind of running water or something

1329.84 --> 1334.32
but i have no idea what that sound came

1332.0 --> 1336.559
from that's super weird i heard it from

1334.32 --> 1338.72
that direction there is no water there

1336.559 --> 1341.12
so i don't know what's going on

1338.72 --> 1341.1200000000001
anyway

1342.88 --> 1345.88
hmm

1351.039 --> 1356.64
all right anyway listening back to it

1354.24 --> 1359.84
it's really stands out to me that

1356.64 --> 1362.4
it is just like early digital music and

1359.84 --> 1364.8799999999999
compared to what was out back then it's

1362.4 --> 1367.52
super impressive it's just that

1364.88 --> 1369.2800000000002
sound quality has like really moved on

1367.52 --> 1371.52
since then a lot

1369.28 --> 1372.6399999999999
so like listening back even to it it's

1371.52 --> 1375.679
like

1372.64 --> 1378.0800000000002
yeah i loved it but man it's it is kind

1375.679 --> 1380.0
of shitty compared to what is out now

1378.08 --> 1381.76
like if i for example just listen to

1380.0 --> 1384.32
mine in a box

1381.76 --> 1386.64
like that's even better quality

1384.32 --> 1389.6399999999999
and it is retro

1386.64 --> 1389.64
so

1393.919 --> 1397.1200000000001
retro enthusiasts much prefer original

1396.0 --> 1400.12
hardware

1397.12 --> 1400.12
right

1403.44 --> 1408.24
hey the virgin droid

1405.36 --> 1408.24
yeah thanks man

1412.159 --> 1417.5200000000002
right but anyway look my whole thing

1414.559 --> 1419.36
about the amiga 1200 of the amiga series

1417.52 --> 1421.2
company and all that

1419.36 --> 1424.24
it's mostly about just the entire

1421.2 --> 1426.799
injustice of everything that happened

1424.24 --> 1429.039
because the amiga was like so much ahead

1426.799 --> 1431.679
of it it was like

1429.039 --> 1434.4
five years ahead of the curve of like

1431.679 --> 1436.799
all developments and every all computer

1434.4 --> 1438.72
businesses were like in a way jealous of

1436.799 --> 1442.32
amiga because they were just like holy

1438.72 --> 1445.52
[ __ ] how do these guys keep doing that

1442.32 --> 1447.4399999999998
that's why i was like super amiga fan

1445.52 --> 1451.039
because i just was like yeah this is

1447.44 --> 1453.6000000000001
better like oh oh you got your polygon

1451.039 --> 1456.08
racing game on your pc

1453.6 --> 1459.6789999999999
oh that's so special

1456.08 --> 1461.279
yeah here's an amiga 1200 with a 3d

1459.679 --> 1464.24
pre-rendered

1461.279 --> 1466.559
fly scene from super stardust that

1464.24 --> 1469.76
absolutely blows your mind and should

1466.559 --> 1470.6399999999999
make you ashamed of even playing on a pc

1469.76 --> 1472.96
right

1470.64 --> 1474.0
that was my attitude

1472.96 --> 1475.44
i mean

1474.0 --> 1480.0
amiga

1475.44 --> 1484.4
had 3d pre-rendered graphics

1480.0 --> 1486.799
like 10 years before any other

1484.4 --> 1488.96
computer ever had that like

1486.799 --> 1490.4
it was all like a big deal when like

1488.96 --> 1492.4
donkey kong con

1490.4 --> 1495.2
country came out remember that because

1492.4 --> 1497.039
it was like a completely pre

1495.2 --> 1499.1200000000001
rendered 3d

1497.039 --> 1500.64
background everything all the animations

1499.12 --> 1502.6399999999999
all the character was all it was very

1500.64 --> 1506.24
impressive right

1502.64 --> 1508.5590000000002
that was like the late 90s

1506.24 --> 1509.44
i think

1508.559 --> 1512.84
was it

1509.44 --> 1515.679
maybe mid 90s but like

1512.84 --> 1517.4399999999998
seriously pre-rendered

1515.679 --> 1522.3200000000002
graphics

1517.44 --> 1522.3200000000002
were around for a while on the amiga

1522.72 --> 1526.96
they were like the only ones even doing

1524.799 --> 1528.799
that

1526.96 --> 1530.4
so they were just ahead of the curve

1528.799 --> 1532.6399999999999
constantly

1530.4 --> 1534.96
and it was just

1532.64 --> 1536.7990000000002
a huge bummer that they went out of

1534.96 --> 1539.8400000000001
business

1536.799 --> 1539.84
huge bummer

1541.279 --> 1546.64
and i partially blamed bill gates

1544.159 --> 1549.6000000000001
because he was just screwing around with

1546.64 --> 1549.6000000000001
the entire scene

1549.919 --> 1552.72
uh

1550.799 --> 1554.799
he did not help

1552.72 --> 1557.799
hey flatter sage good to see you jeff

1554.799 --> 1557.799
gassett

1563.039 --> 1568.0
right but yeah after baldur's gate came

1566.24 --> 1570.799
out on the pc

1568.0 --> 1572.32
i really kind of forgot about the amiga

1570.799 --> 1573.279
i kind of did

1572.32 --> 1575.52
because

1573.279 --> 1578.159
that game just was

1575.52 --> 1580.559
that was just a whole new level

1578.159 --> 1580.5590000000002
for me

1582.0 --> 1585.919
to like have like

1584.559 --> 1588.1589999999999
yeah

1585.919 --> 1590.0800000000002
did you the me it was the music it was

1588.159 --> 1591.679
really the music

1590.08 --> 1593.279
it was like when there was like

1591.679 --> 1595.8400000000001
classical

1593.279 --> 1597.44
pre-sampled assembled music like

1595.84 --> 1600.24
digitally

1597.44 --> 1602.4
assembled classic samples

1600.24 --> 1605.039
based music classic instrument and

1602.4 --> 1607.279
that's just like wow

1605.039 --> 1610.559
that blew my mind so hard i kind of

1607.279 --> 1610.559
forgot about the amiga

1611.12 --> 1613.84
ah

1619.52 --> 1623.2
right but yeah again i've always been

1621.76 --> 1626.8799999999999
like

1623.2 --> 1628.0
pulled in by just good music quality

1626.88 --> 1630.48
games

1628.0 --> 1632.88
that didn't have good music they just

1630.48 --> 1632.88
sucked

1633.36 --> 1636.9599999999998
except maybe for like

1635.2 --> 1639.2
boulder dash construction kit on the

1636.96 --> 1641.8400000000001
commodore 64. it did not have music but

1639.2 --> 1641.8400000000001
i spent

1642.08 --> 1646.559
like a thousand hours making levels on

1644.24 --> 1649.1200000000001
that thing

1646.559 --> 1651.52
and i'm really sad that i don't have it

1649.12 --> 1654.0
anymore like i still remember the floppy

1651.52 --> 1656.72
disk somebody else has it i have no idea

1654.0 --> 1659.84
what they're doing with it maybe my my

1656.72 --> 1661.679
commodore 64 floppy disk game levels i

1659.84 --> 1665.36
made like

1661.679 --> 1668.64
20 super complex bullet dash levels like

1665.36 --> 1671.12
real puzzles i like i i basically made

1668.64 --> 1672.0800000000002
an entire video game

1671.12 --> 1674.1589999999999
right

1672.08 --> 1676.559
that would be like worth selling and

1674.159 --> 1679.1200000000001
like with a lot better levels than all

1676.559 --> 1681.36
other com combined will the dash games i

1679.12 --> 1682.559
was fanatical about it dude

1681.36 --> 1684.399
yeah you know

1682.559 --> 1686.1589999999999
of course i even wanted to make a super

1684.399 --> 1687.84
boulder dash i still have the blueprints

1686.159 --> 1689.279
i showed them one time

1687.84 --> 1691.12
but

1689.279 --> 1694.0
i kind of hoped that it ended up in the

1691.12 --> 1696.4799999999998
demo scene and that my levels are like

1694.0 --> 1699.36
that people have it because i put so

1696.48 --> 1702.799
much work into it so much

1699.36 --> 1706.279
it's just so sad the idea that it would

1702.799 --> 1706.279
all be lost

1715.279 --> 1718.88
oh really you wear bullet dash

1716.72 --> 1723.72
construction kit also

1718.88 --> 1723.72
we're into that pgc net that's awesome

1724.48 --> 1728.72
right but yeah maybe somebody knows

1729.12 --> 1731.6789999999999
out there

1732.0 --> 1736.799
because i mean like even the the floppy

1734.32 --> 1739.4399999999998
disk had like a very distinct

1736.799 --> 1741.76
label on it

1739.44 --> 1743.76
like that i lit personally drew so it's

1741.76 --> 1747.76
not like a random floppy disk that would

1743.76 --> 1747.76
just be thrown away that would be crazy

1749.919 --> 1755.2
so maybe hopefully you like

1752.72 --> 1756.88
passed it on to the scene and like my

1755.2 --> 1757.919
levels are out there in some boulder

1756.88 --> 1760.24
dash

1757.919 --> 1764.5200000000002
construction kit level collection of

1760.24 --> 1764.52
somebody i really hope that

1766.64 --> 1770.64
yeah yeah yeah that's true carl apple

1768.88 --> 1772.64
yeah i remember that

1770.64 --> 1774.159
yeah commodore 64.

1772.64 --> 1775.5200000000002
you could like

1774.159 --> 1778.96
go on

1775.52 --> 1781.36
like sort of a terminal thing

1778.96 --> 1783.6000000000001
with a modem

1781.36 --> 1785.52
that was so weird

1783.6 --> 1789.279
i i didn't really know how to do it my

1785.52 --> 1791.84
brother did he like he just yeah use the

1789.279 --> 1794.64
commodore 64 to like

1791.84 --> 1798.399
download files from a website

1794.64 --> 1800.72
or yeah from a non-browser

1798.399 --> 1800.7199999999998
site

1800.96 --> 1804.159
i still remember that

1804.799 --> 1809.84
not cassette deck yeah yeah me too of

1806.96 --> 1809.8400000000001
course

1811.679 --> 1816.799
but yeah as soon as the the

1813.919 --> 1818.48
luggage disk drive came out that all

1816.799 --> 1821.2
changed

1818.48 --> 1823.91
because it was just so much easier using

1821.2 --> 1825.279
the disk drive so much faster

1823.91 --> 1828.64
[Music]

1825.279 --> 1828.64
and easier to store too

1829.279 --> 1833.52
because

1830.88 --> 1833.5200000000002
hilarious

1834.159 --> 1838.0
but they did always have like an amusing

1836.24 --> 1839.919
system for that

1838.0 --> 1841.36
where you put the cassette deck you put

1839.919 --> 1844.48
the cassette in

1841.36 --> 1845.52
and then start loading the game

1844.48 --> 1847.84
and then

1845.52 --> 1849.279
like sometimes

1847.84 --> 1851.6
you would have like

1849.279 --> 1854.399
an image on screen

1851.6 --> 1856.9599999999998
and a music while the tape was loading

1854.399 --> 1859.1999999999998
the rest of the game that was also i

1856.96 --> 1860.559
thought it was very creative

1859.2 --> 1862.48
but they did that

1860.559 --> 1865.279
that like made it worth it you just have

1862.48 --> 1867.44
like a a a waiting

1865.279 --> 1869.679
music and image

1867.44 --> 1871.2
it was pretty cool

1869.679 --> 1872.64
like especially with games like

1871.2 --> 1876.88
cybernoid

1872.64 --> 1876.88
had very impressive songs

1877.039 --> 1882.36
or for such an old computer anyway

1893.76 --> 1897.36
mutt

1894.88 --> 1898.3990000000001
or successful massive multiplayer rpg

1897.36 --> 1900.7199999999998
what

1898.399 --> 1900.7199999999998
wow

1902.24 --> 1907.84
i

1903.6 --> 1907.84
i don't even remember that

1920.159 --> 1925.919
yeah yeah that virgin droid yeah

1923.12 --> 1925.9189999999999
good old days

1926.159 --> 1930.48
it was the good old days because it was

1928.159 --> 1932.88
just all freshly developing and it was

1930.48 --> 1935.2
relatively easy to develop and so big

1932.88 --> 1936.7990000000002
corporations couldn't really corner it

1935.2 --> 1939.1200000000001
as much

1936.799 --> 1942.559
it was just everybody could just like oh

1939.12 --> 1944.9599999999998
game magazine oh here's the code if you

1942.559 --> 1947.2
use this code you can literally program

1944.96 --> 1949.76
your own video game like how can you

1947.2 --> 1951.3600000000001
stop that you know you can't it's just

1949.76 --> 1953.919
it was completely

1951.36 --> 1956.4799999999998
open grounds

1953.919 --> 1957.919
and really these days it isn't i mean

1956.48 --> 1961.039
you can

1957.919 --> 1962.7990000000002
make little silly games or whatever

1961.039 --> 1964.72
but

1962.799 --> 1965.679
yeah that's not really competing or

1964.72 --> 1968.3990000000001
anything

1965.679 --> 1970.96
it's not gonna impress everybody that

1968.399 --> 1974.4799999999998
much like unless you're just making an

1970.96 --> 1977.679
official program of it

1974.48 --> 1980.159
but yeah

1977.679 --> 1982.24
takes a lot more work

1980.159 --> 1984.96
especially the ironing out back then

1982.24 --> 1986.96
ironing out wasn't really an issue you

1984.96 --> 1989.039
just had to program it right and

1986.96 --> 1991.44
otherwise like it wouldn't even start it

1989.039 --> 1993.279
would just not work so

1991.44 --> 1995.76
when you then got it working then you

1993.279 --> 1998.159
knew yeah i got it right because it

1995.76 --> 1998.1589999999999
works

2002.96 --> 2008.3990000000001
i think i don't know i've never done

2005.36 --> 2012.08
like commodore 64 programming

2008.399 --> 2012.08
see my brother do it a lot though

2017.12 --> 2022.1589999999999
like the actual code program i only ever

2019.519 --> 2024.159
worked with commodore basic

2022.159 --> 2025.3600000000001
which you can't really do anything with

2024.159 --> 2030.969
that

2025.36 --> 2030.9689999999998
[Music]

2050.56 --> 2053.56

2061.04 --> 2063.839
what the hell

2064.079 --> 2070.9190000000003
what is that that that sound came from

2066.72 --> 2070.919
my computer what the [ __ ]

2080.96 --> 2084.52
how is that

2097.359 --> 2101.3199999999997
that is very bizarre

2101.91 --> 2105.1499999999996
[Music]

2107.359 --> 2112.3199999999997
i hope my computer isn't just

2110.24 --> 2114.839
blatantly overheating

2112.32 --> 2119.56
i really hope

2114.839 --> 2119.56
not it sounds so weird

2132.56 --> 2136.0789999999997
you can make games these days in the

2134.079 --> 2139.119
unreal five engine yeah but that's all

2136.079 --> 2142.76
3d [ __ ]

2139.119 --> 2142.76
it's always that

2153.359 --> 2156.359
hmm

2164.079 --> 2169.8390000000004
i have an idea for real time game that

2167.119 --> 2171.04
will make built really

2169.839 --> 2172.48
shadow

2171.04 --> 2176.0
okay

2172.48 --> 2177.119
well let's talk about it in private then

2176.0 --> 2180.16
shall we

2177.119 --> 2180.1600000000003
you got my email

2183.52 --> 2189.119
by the way if we got any programming

2185.839 --> 2191.359
enthusiasts i am still like i still have

2189.119 --> 2194.4
like my boulder dash super bowler dash

2191.359 --> 2196.4
project in weight i mean

2194.4 --> 2201.32
it's literally

2196.4 --> 2201.32
like you could literally just make it

2201.68 --> 2205.44
like the into all the details are all

2203.76 --> 2208.2400000000002
worked out and everything how it's

2205.44 --> 2211.04
supposed to work is just it's a fully

2208.24 --> 2212.4799999999996
matrixed out game i like completely

2211.04 --> 2215.7599999999998
made the entire

2212.48 --> 2218.72
just one giant cross-referencing table

2215.76 --> 2218.7200000000003
of a lot

2219.04 --> 2222.24
all you have to do is like some basic

2220.64 --> 2223.7599999999998
graphics doesn't even matter all that

2222.24 --> 2226.4799999999996
much

2223.76 --> 2229.0400000000004
can even be basic pixelated kind of like

2226.48 --> 2231.68
the boulder dash look

2229.04 --> 2234.0
from the commodore 64.

2231.68 --> 2235.1189999999997
and if anybody is interested in doing

2234.0 --> 2238.16
that

2235.119 --> 2240.2400000000002
i yeah i'd love to like partner up

2238.16 --> 2243.839
although yeah be warned i did i can't

2240.24 --> 2243.839
program i don't know how to do it

2244.0 --> 2248.079
but i have the blueprints if anybody's

2246.24 --> 2250.8799999999997
interested in such things

2248.079 --> 2252.6400000000003
and has some spare time which is very

2250.88 --> 2257.2000000000003
rare

2252.64 --> 2259.1189999999997
as far as i know with programmers

2257.2 --> 2260.96
yeah but let me know

2259.119 --> 2265.2000000000003
if you're actually interested

2260.96 --> 2269.64
we could like skype talk about it and

2265.2 --> 2269.64
yeah i could send you the scans

2272.88 --> 2276.56
better it would be better if you

2274.64 --> 2277.44
actually was were in the netherlands and

2276.56 --> 2278.72
then

2277.44 --> 2282.0
because then we could just get

2278.72 --> 2282.0
face-to-face contact

2283.119 --> 2287.599
uh but i'm yeah

2285.52 --> 2289.839
i mean i made that

2287.599 --> 2293.119
holy [ __ ] so long ago

2289.839 --> 2294.48
i made that that game

2293.119 --> 2296.4
when i was like

2294.48 --> 2298.72
16

2296.4 --> 2300.48
or 15.

2298.72 --> 2303.5989999999997
so that's

2300.48 --> 2303.599
quite a long time ago

2304.16 --> 2307.1189999999997
almost 30 years

2307.839 --> 2312.839
but it's still like it's still solid

2314.16 --> 2316.56
anyway

2324.0 --> 2327.0
huh

2329.52 --> 2333.04
by the way jeddah since you're still

2330.96 --> 2336.56
here in chat it is

2333.04 --> 2336.56
have you already attempted

2336.8 --> 2342.1600000000003
the bank transfer thing

2340.0 --> 2345.48
because i haven't had feedback since my

2342.16 --> 2345.48
last reply

2422.839 --> 2427.599
downstairs i think i might pop it in the

2425.28 --> 2427.599
oven

2427.92 --> 2430.8
i'll be right back

2432.72 --> 2437.2799999999997
oh and and maybe i could like bring up

2434.88 --> 2439.44
flat earth too i mean

2437.28 --> 2442.1600000000003
can't have like two shows in a row where

2439.44 --> 2445.16
flatter gets doesn't even get mentioned

2442.16 --> 2445.16
once

2496.48 --> 2503.239
um

2498.17 --> 2503.239
[Music]

2510.24 --> 2515.04
right so anybody

2512.16 --> 2516.16
everybody has water stocked up in the

2515.04 --> 2517.2
cooler

2516.16 --> 2520.7999999999997
make sure

2517.2 --> 2522.72
to always stock up your water in glass

2520.8 --> 2524.65
bottles

2522.72 --> 2526.16
right don't use plastic

2524.65 --> 2528.0
[Music]

2526.16 --> 2529.92
or i don't know

2528.0 --> 2533.119
use paper

2529.92 --> 2537.28
very weird but i guess that works too

2533.119 --> 2540.1600000000003
it even tells you to reuse it so

2537.28 --> 2542.96
but don't use plastics ball plastic

2540.16 --> 2545.04
bottles especially when it's really hot

2542.96 --> 2547.2
because they are going to leach

2545.04 --> 2550.319
and you don't want that

2547.2 --> 2552.48
and besides like if you put the glass in

2550.319 --> 2554.8
the cooler that usually works a lot

2552.48 --> 2554.8
better

2558.24 --> 2562.319
like the glass

2559.52 --> 2565.319
will also be nice and cold so

2562.319 --> 2565.319
huh

2572.96 --> 2576.64
i didn't realize our computers were

2574.88 --> 2580.2400000000002
going to be mainframe

2576.64 --> 2580.24
with hard drives right

2580.96 --> 2587.119
which is very odd by the way that they

2584.4 --> 2589.2000000000003
apparently just did not have the vision

2587.119 --> 2590.7200000000003
to see that coming

2589.2 --> 2592.56
it's like yeah you're developing

2590.72 --> 2595.7599999999998
computers but apparently you don't even

2592.56 --> 2595.7599999999998
realize like how

2596.0 --> 2598.96
where it's gonna go

2599.04 --> 2602.44
very weird

2632.88 --> 2638.44
but yeah

2635.44 --> 2638.44
anyway

2638.7 --> 2641.8799999999997
[Music]

2650.24 --> 2655.839
make sure to go to my twitter page and

2652.72 --> 2657.7599999999998
like my posts sort of maybe

2655.839 --> 2660.16
although it does seem i checked out

2657.76 --> 2663.5200000000004
nathan's channel there

2660.16 --> 2665.2799999999997
it doesn't really get a lot of responses

2663.52 --> 2668.079
either

2665.28 --> 2671.3590000000004
so i guess that's the standard fate of

2668.079 --> 2671.3590000000004
flat earthers on twitter

2671.68 --> 2676.64
people do

2673.359 --> 2677.92
sort of seem to avoid you

2676.64 --> 2681.04
in general

2677.92 --> 2681.04
that's not surprising

2681.92 --> 2686.76

2683.76 --> 2686.76

[Music]

2718.319 --> 2720.24
right

2719.2 --> 2722.56
yeah

2720.24 --> 2724.16
i don't even know why they do that

2722.56 --> 2728.24
like

2724.16 --> 2730.72
are they is ibm just like a developer

2728.24 --> 2730.72
company

2730.96 --> 2736.64
they keep like developing this stuff and

2733.04 --> 2738.8
then selling it to other companies

2736.64 --> 2740.96
it just seems like why would you do that

2738.8 --> 2743.3590000000004
why wouldn't you actually just like

2740.96 --> 2745.599
corner that market then i don't get it

2743.359 --> 2745.5989999999997
but

2763.76 --> 2768.44
what does that mean jeff gas head

2780.72 --> 2784.7999999999997
right

2782.8 --> 2788.2400000000002
anyway i guess we're not really going to

2784.8 --> 2790.48
talk about flat earth in my show today

2788.24 --> 2793.4399999999996
i was hoping to kind of bring it back up

2790.48 --> 2795.599
again but maybe it's just too hot

2793.44 --> 2797.2000000000003
one thing is sure that even sweat

2795.599 --> 2799.04
droplets

2797.2 --> 2801.7599999999998
there's enough of them they will

2799.04 --> 2804.96
eventually find their level

2801.76 --> 2804.96
just like water does

2807.2 --> 2811.04
then

2809.52 --> 2812.24
yeah

2811.04 --> 2815.2799999999997
gravity

2812.24 --> 2818.16
doesn't really exist because the gravity

2815.28 --> 2821.119
that is usually used is

2818.16 --> 2821.1189999999997
indicating a

2821.599 --> 2825.3590000000004
matter of being displaced to the center

2824.0 --> 2826.8
of a point

2825.359 --> 2827.5989999999997
it isn't

2826.8 --> 2830.079
just

2827.599 --> 2833.839
relative density

2830.079 --> 2833.8390000000004
universally directional

2836.079 --> 2838.319
oh

2839.04 --> 2845.4
whoa

3023.119 --> 3029.04
the government to do that like why the

hell would any with any

3034.88 --> 3041.6800000000003
any why would any landlord do that

3037.52 --> 3044.319
that's crazy like in in england i could

3041.68 --> 3046.24
imagine because they do get like budgets

3044.319 --> 3049.88
and [ __ ] and all that and

3059.92 --> 3064.96
why don't you

3062.079 --> 3068.4
get a lawyer then

3064.96 --> 3070.4
he's just not keeping the agreement

3068.4 --> 3073.44
that's illegal

3070.4 --> 3073.44
seeking star wars

3074.48 --> 3080.319
they have to do that

3077.68 --> 3083.839
or you could like sue him for

3080.319 --> 3083.839
breach of contract

3088.4 --> 3091.4590000000003
[Music]

3109.04 --> 3113.599
right but yeah it still sucks though if

3111.68 --> 3115.839
your landlord's just gone and say i know

3113.599 --> 3118.1600000000003
how that worked i mean my landlord tried

3115.839 --> 3120.319
to do that with me as well i did he

3118.16 --> 3122.24
would i you have to remember seeking

3120.319 --> 3125.7599999999998
star wars it's like

3122.24 --> 3128.72
two years ago my landlord did that he

3125.76 --> 3129.8390000000004
just said you have to go out and then

3128.72 --> 3131.359
like

3129.839 --> 3133.68
even like

3131.359 --> 3136.0789999999997
wrote slanderous letters about how i'm

3133.68 --> 3139.1189999999997
abusive and insane and

3136.079 --> 3141.28
like to get me out

3139.119 --> 3143.52
yeah i did not budge he could not

3141.28 --> 3146.0
actually prove it

3143.52 --> 3148.559
and he just backed down

3146.0 --> 3150.8
so if he's gone nuts maybe you should

3148.559 --> 3153.8390000000004
actually hold your ground don't get

3150.8 --> 3153.8390000000004
pushed out

3153.92 --> 3157.52
and get a lawyer

3155.92 --> 3159.44
at least for

3157.52 --> 3161.92
for some advice

3159.44 --> 3161.92
something

3164.64 --> 3171.44
right if he's breaking contract that

3167.119 --> 3173.92
means that you're in the better position

3171.44 --> 3177.04
all you have to do is not panic not give

3173.92 --> 3177.04
in to the peer pressure

3177.92 --> 3183.119
yeah exactly what jeff gassett says keep

3180.559 --> 3183.119
your head up

3185.76 --> 3191.2000000000003
i mean it's unnerving but

3187.76 --> 3192.8390000000004
if he's in breach that's then he just

3191.2 --> 3195.4399999999996
can't do

3192.839 --> 3198.35
anything except makes things even worse

3224.16 --> 3228.16

yeah i don't know if that is in the in

3228.16 --> 3232.8799999999997
the united states to be seen at but yeah

3230.559 --> 3237.3190000000004
in the netherlands that was the case

3232.88 --> 3237.319
i didn't have to pay for my lawyer

3240.72 --> 3243.4399999999996
meanwhile at this level stationery

3242.48 --> 3245.44
sacred

3243.44 --> 3247.92
i don't know if it's sacred

3245.44 --> 3251.839
anything earthly is earthly and the

3247.92 --> 3251.839
material is not sacred

3252.64 --> 3255.2799999999997
spirit is

3256.0 --> 3260.48
god

3258.319 --> 3262.88
not god's creation i don't think it's

3260.48 --> 3262.88
sacred

3263.04 --> 3268.96
but god that dwells among its creation

3265.839 --> 3270.16
through spirit that is sacred spirit is

3268.96 --> 3271.92
sacred not

3270.16 --> 3273.04
not the matter

3271.92 --> 3274.96
anyway

3273.04 --> 3276.96
but yes you can start with just don't

3274.96 --> 3280.559
panic

3276.96 --> 3283.44
don't make rash decisions though go into

3280.559 --> 3285.92
i have to flee now mode

3283.44 --> 3287.28
because the guy might go completely out

3285.92 --> 3290.0
of his mind

3287.28 --> 3290.0
don't panic

3290.24 --> 3295.04
hold your ground

3292.559 --> 3297.2000000000003
figure out if he can actually get away

3295.04 --> 3298.0
with what he's doing

3297.2 --> 3299.52
through

3298.0 --> 3302.76
lawyers

3299.52 --> 3302.7599999999998
good ones

3307.44 --> 3311.839
sneaky rats right yeah but that doesn't

3309.92 --> 3314.7200000000003
really matter if they're sneaky rats

3311.839 --> 3316.48
right they can bully you they can peer

3314.72 --> 3318.319
pressure you they can

3316.48 --> 3321.92
slander you

3318.319 --> 3323.92
but the rules are the rules it's the law

3321.92 --> 3326.96
there's just things that they they can't

3323.92 --> 3328.319
just kick you out they just can't they

3326.96 --> 3329.92
just

3328.319 --> 3332.079
can't

3329.92 --> 3334.4
that's just not possible

3332.079 --> 3337.119
it's like very

3334.4 --> 3340.4
strong law

3337.119 --> 3340.4
that makes that impossible

3340.88 --> 3344.88
so just don't panic

3343.2 --> 3348.2799999999997
figure it out

3344.88 --> 3348.28
take it easy

3360.319 --> 3366.44
get my illuminati

3363.2 --> 3366.4399999999996

3443.2 --> 3447.839

3444.799 --> 3447.839

anything

3488.72 --> 3492.48

3519.04 --> 3522.04
um

3534.079 --> 3536.319
right

3536.799 --> 3540.16

3538.48 --> 3541.52
easy

3540.16 --> 3545.7599999999998
don't

3541.52 --> 3547.52
rush to conclusions don't panic

3545.76 --> 3549.6800000000003
think about it

3547.52 --> 3552.64
a little more closely

3549.68 --> 3552.64
let it sink a bit

3553.44 --> 3558.799
and seriously considered like

3556.559 --> 3560.3190000000004
at least consulting a lawyer about your

3558.799 --> 3563.92
situation

3560.319 --> 3563.92
before you make any conclusions

3567.44 --> 3572.599
and

3568.799 --> 3572.599
yeah the best of luck

3577.599 --> 3580.599
okay

3592.88 --> 3598.1600000000003
yeah that's right what pj cnet says

3596.24 --> 3600.799
right but i'm gonna round out the show

3598.16 --> 3603.52
it's been very short

3600.799 --> 3605.7599999999998
but uh yeah

3603.52 --> 3608.079
short hot

3605.76 --> 3610.559
and more of the same of yesterday

3608.079 --> 3612.88
computer talk i guess it's it's in the

3610.559 --> 3612.88
air

3613.28 --> 3617.44
but i get it i do like like

3615.92 --> 3620.48
hanging around with you guys i know a

3617.44 --> 3622.2400000000002
lot of you are kind of like

3620.48 --> 3625.359
what do you call it like

3622.24 --> 3626.3999999999996
semi boomers kind of of my age or like

3625.359 --> 3628.72
up

3626.4 --> 3630.0
so you went through a lot that i went

3628.72 --> 3632.8799999999997
through too

3630.0 --> 3636.0
so it's kind of nice just sharing

3632.88 --> 3636.0
experience about that

3636.319 --> 3640.319
i do appreciate it

3638.799 --> 3643.119
and it's kind of funny also that a lot

3640.319 --> 3645.2
of you are kind of nervous

3643.119 --> 3647.119
but that's a good thing

3645.2 --> 3649.839
nerds are awesome

3647.119 --> 3651.839
it's just that

3649.839 --> 3655.359
they usually take a little longer before

3651.839 --> 3656.96
they develop proper social skills

3655.359 --> 3658.72
but in this age

3656.96 --> 3660.2400000000002
that yeah with the internet the way it

3658.72 --> 3663.5989999999997
is now

3660.24 --> 3664.9599999999996
that ability is certainly a lot closer

3663.599 --> 3667.44
like

3664.96 --> 3669.52
you're not isolated by computers anymore

3667.44 --> 3671.2000000000003
as you used to be because people that

3669.52 --> 3674.319
were on computers a lot they were

3671.2 --> 3675.68
isolated that's why they were nerds

3674.319 --> 3678.48
they were just on the computer and they

3675.68 --> 3680.64
were scared or like they didn't like

3678.48 --> 3683.28
like hang around with people they just

3680.64 --> 3685.7599999999998
wanted the computer well now computer is

3683.28 --> 3690.0
means internet

3685.76 --> 3690.0
so it's a completely different world now

3690.799 --> 3695.04
so

3691.52 --> 3696.4
i predicted even a while ago

3695.04 --> 3698.4
that

3696.4 --> 3701.04
like the internet would basically

3698.4 --> 3703.599
get all the nerds

3701.04 --> 3706.319
out of their nerdish isolated position

3703.599 --> 3708.6400000000003
and develop standard social skills so

3706.319 --> 3710.96
they would actually be just an average

3708.64 --> 3712.5589999999997
person social skill wise

3710.96 --> 3715.039
but with a lot of knowledge about

3712.559 --> 3716.88
computers and programming

3715.039 --> 3717.8390000000004
which is a much better way to go by the

3716.88 --> 3720.48
way

3717.839 --> 3720.48
really it is

3720.799 --> 3724.96
you don't want to be your

3722.799 --> 3726.559
isolated your entire life

3724.96 --> 3728.2400000000002
like that

3726.559 --> 3731.039
but it wasn't gonna be because the

3728.24 --> 3732.8799999999997
internet came right so anyway
