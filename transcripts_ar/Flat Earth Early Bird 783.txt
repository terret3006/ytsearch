so yeah the weather today is

94.72 --> 101.03999999999999
what yeah there's a little bit of sun

98.4 --> 103.52000000000001
here and there

101.04 --> 104.96000000000001
but also quite a lot of clouds and it

103.52 --> 108.15899999999999
yeah it's stormy

104.96 --> 111.439
it's there's a storm outside and this

108.159 --> 114.64
night that storm was pretty heavy

111.439 --> 117.52
like it was pretty damn heavy

114.64 --> 119.43900000000001
even the the chair on the balcony was

117.52 --> 121.759
just bouncing around like a pinball

119.439 --> 124.39899999999999
machine at some point because

121.759 --> 126.32
the wind gusts were just incredibly

124.399 --> 129.84
strong

126.32 --> 131.92
right now it's not as strong but still

129.84 --> 135.68
strong enough that you constantly notice

131.92 --> 135.67999999999998
it and if you leave the door open then

135.76 --> 143.12
somewhere you're gonna know

139.84 --> 147.04
it's probably gonna bang open or

143.12 --> 149.44
closed at some point right but it is dry

147.04 --> 149.44
at least

152.319 --> 160.72
mostly ah

157.04 --> 160.72
on a webcam right

161.04 --> 163.35999999999999
so

164.239 --> 175.20000000000002
yes thursday the 21st of january 2021

170.239 --> 176.64000000000001
uh you built in snowman last night here

175.2 --> 179.76
we go again

176.64 --> 182.07999999999998
one foot high so there's still snow over

179.76 --> 182.07999999999998
there

183.04 --> 189.04
huh anyway good to see you

186.48 --> 189.04
in chat

190.56 --> 195.36
all right i've got green tea with me as

196.84 --> 203.12
usual

199.519 --> 205.28
all right not enough snow well

203.12 --> 207.59900000000002
we only had one day of snow and after

205.28 --> 210.959
that it was all gone

207.599 --> 210.959
hasn't been back since

211.599 --> 217.44
i guess over in england it's a little

214.64 --> 217.44
bit more snow

217.84 --> 227.84
anyway yeah

228.08 --> 233.20000000000002
i don't think it was quite busy

230.56 --> 233.2
yesterday

235.92 --> 241.2
and up until pretty late i think like

238.239 --> 244.08
five o'clock

241.2 --> 244.07999999999998
hey hello m

245.28 --> 251.439
yeah right so yesterday's

249.12 --> 254.56
flat earth early bird was yeah was a lot

251.439 --> 258.799
of fun a lot

254.56 --> 263.6
around languages that was pretty good

258.799 --> 263.59999999999997
it was just fun to do that

264.0 --> 269.28
uh also yeah

267.199 --> 270.88
at some point my friend called me up

269.28 --> 272.79999999999995
again and

270.88 --> 274.0
all together three and a half hours

272.8 --> 277.199
phone conversation

274.0 --> 280.479
had a lot of energy

277.199 --> 281.12
she wanted to share and talking about

280.479 --> 284.15999999999997
her kid

281.12 --> 287.6
also a lot and like

284.16 --> 289.12
her own composure against the entire

287.6 --> 291.84000000000003
world how that works it's really

289.12 --> 297.84000000000003
fascinating to keep track of that and

291.84 --> 297.84
she's doing pretty good

297.919 --> 301.12
and she was also complimenting me and

300.4 --> 304.08
that was odd

301.12 --> 304.639
but i guess that she thought i needed it

304.08 --> 307.919
because

304.639 --> 309.759
i feel a little demoralized but

307.919 --> 311.19899999999996
it's not that bad though you know i'm

309.759 --> 314.24
getting over it

311.199 --> 316.0
sort of re-figuring out like what is the

314.24 --> 318.24
situation what's going on what are the

316.0 --> 321.6
new pitfalls

318.24 --> 325.84000000000003
and i think i'm having a little bit

321.6 --> 325.84000000000003
trouble sizing it up

325.919 --> 331.35999999999996
but i i have certain feelings about how

328.72 --> 334.759
things might unroll

331.36 --> 338.08000000000004
and that it might like almost be

334.759 --> 340.08000000000004
anti-climactically underwhelming while

338.08 --> 343.12
everybody is expecting it to be

340.08 --> 345.96
suddenly overwhelming kind of thing

343.12 --> 347.84000000000003
because of our anticip because of the

345.96 --> 353.44
anti-anticipations that have been

347.84 --> 356.63899999999995
well programmed into us

353.44 --> 358.8
because of the documents you know what i

356.639 --> 361.6
mean

358.8 --> 362.08
so i wonder how yeah how things are

361.6 --> 366.16
gonna

362.08 --> 369.35999999999996
unroll especially in the u.s

366.16 --> 371.03900000000004
uh but over here as well there's just a

369.36 --> 373.12
lot of

371.039 --> 375.59999999999997
ridiculous stuff happening there they

373.12 --> 375.6
got this

377.12 --> 383.199
is it like an evening clock

380.24 --> 385.12
lockdown thing now and more stores also

383.199 --> 388.16
here are getting

385.12 --> 392.24
visits and getting

388.16 --> 394.56
basically nagged it's like oh you're not

392.24 --> 397.919
complying to the covet policies enough

394.56 --> 397.919
you have to shut down and

398.16 --> 402.56
like in a store that i went to yesterday

400.319 --> 402.56
even

402.639 --> 409.52
like they had to do at the door type of

407.199 --> 411.36
yeah package delivery as they called it

409.52 --> 415.68
was weird

411.36 --> 418.08000000000004
but the like the guy was still going

415.68 --> 419.12
but yeah it's just basically his store

418.08 --> 421.52
had been attacked

419.12 --> 424.08
basically trying to encourage him to

421.52 --> 427.44
completely shut down it's

424.08 --> 428.0
and it is completely senseless and he

427.44 --> 432.0
knows it

428.0 --> 432.0
and it feels like an attack

432.16 --> 441.199
so that's happening over here

437.36 --> 447.12
right also watched some owen benjamin

441.199 --> 448.72
on a bit shoot at a new video

447.12 --> 450.319
because he's still doing videos it's

448.72 --> 453.36
just not live anymore

450.319 --> 457.03900000000004
or yeah well not to me

453.36 --> 459.039
like if i knew if i was on instagram i

457.039 --> 460.479
might be catching some of him live

459.039 --> 462.4
because i think he's doing it through

460.479 --> 465.84
that now he's just streaming through

462.4 --> 465.84
instagram and then posting that

468.319 --> 479.84000000000003
but i'm not on instagram

483.68 --> 489.759
what are you

487.199 --> 491.28000000000003
that that sounds like a joke here we go

489.759 --> 493.91900000000004
again

491.28 --> 496.31899999999996
tourists in bali are made to do press

493.919 --> 500.4
ups for not wearing the mask

496.319 --> 500.40000000000003
that's sounds really ridiculous

504.84 --> 520.88
really

506.16 --> 524.9590000000001
just madness

520.88 --> 524.959
daily mail ran the story

526.16 --> 528.56
all right

530.64 --> 535.8389999999999
well it might be true but it is it is

533.2 --> 535.839
just crazy

560.839 --> 563.839
hmm

570.0 --> 577.04
but yeah there is a lot to think about

573.12 --> 580.399
to look into and to compare and

577.04 --> 583.4399999999999
comparison in ways already been laid

580.399 --> 585.36
with the soviet union

583.44 --> 586.8000000000001
are being more emphasized and that's

585.36 --> 589.76
good it's good to learn

586.8 --> 592.399
to look back and to learn from that also

589.76 --> 595.68
especially the setting

592.399 --> 596.16
because in ways it seems to be applied

595.68 --> 598.8
to the

596.16 --> 605.8389999999999
to a lot in the world now to a lot of

598.8 --> 605.8389999999999
the world

607.76 --> 612.8
and yeah just things like what what you

611.04 --> 614.64
just mentioned

612.8 --> 616.24
tourists being made to press up if

614.64 --> 619.8389999999999
they're not wearing masks it really

616.24 --> 619.839
seems like slave conditioning

626.24 --> 630.72
like medieval slave conditioning it's

629.04 --> 633.8389999999999
like okay if

630.72 --> 636.72
you're part of the regular people

633.839 --> 639.44
and not the higher class you have to do

636.72 --> 639.44
all that [ __ ]

641.92 --> 648.64
and i don't know i guess countries are

644.72 --> 652.48
making up their own types of rules even

648.64 --> 657.519
on how to do it adding their own little

652.48 --> 657.519
spice on top bizarre

657.92 --> 661.8389999999999
hey nathan oakley good to see you

670.079 --> 675.8389999999999
they couldn't on the spot find them

689.6 --> 696.5600000000001
well in a way like who exactly

693.2 --> 698.0
was doing that was it like military

696.56 --> 700.3199999999999
police or something or

698.0 --> 702.16
just a regular police in valley that

700.32 --> 704.48
would do that

702.16 --> 707.279
because it does typically sound like a

704.48 --> 707.279
assist like

709.839 --> 714.24
like certain types of police would do i

712.88 --> 717.04
don't know about

714.24 --> 719.2
bali specifically how it never really

717.04 --> 722.48
looked into it much

719.2 --> 724.88
but like

722.48 --> 726.5600000000001
typical police forces in certain regions

724.88 --> 729.68
would just

726.56 --> 730.079
like hassle people and then it's like

729.68 --> 732.0
okay

730.079 --> 733.68
if you pay us off we'll then just let

732.0 --> 735.36
you go and leave you alone but if you

733.68 --> 735.92
don't have any money then you'll have to

735.36 --> 739.04
go through

735.92 --> 739.04
just this idiocy

739.519 --> 742.5600000000001
just a hassle they would just make you

741.36 --> 744.639
go through a hassle

742.56 --> 747.1999999999999
because you couldn't pay them to just

744.639 --> 747.2
let you go

747.36 --> 752.0
like that sort of stuff has been

749.279 --> 755.279
happening forever

752.0 --> 758.88
it's like common ground so to then

755.279 --> 761.68
just use covet whatever measures

758.88 --> 764.56
as an excuse to engage at that that's

761.68 --> 768.079
not really surprising at all

764.56 --> 771.1999999999999
if you think about it right

768.079 --> 771.76
it's just the latest excuse you can use

771.2 --> 776.32
to

771.76 --> 779.6
apply what you're doing

776.32 --> 780.639
like oh benjamin is also yeah keep on

779.6 --> 783.6800000000001
mentioning him because

780.639 --> 787.12
he just said it very eloquently right

783.68 --> 790.16
and early on that

787.12 --> 792.8
yeah covet is just the new excuse it's

790.16 --> 793.279
like oh oh you really don't want to go

792.8 --> 795.5999999999999
there

793.279 --> 796.639
well just say oh no no covet i can't do

795.6 --> 799.0400000000001
it

796.639 --> 800.88
right it's the excuse or in this case

799.04 --> 802.8
like oh you want to

800.88 --> 804.16
hassle some people try to squeeze some

802.8 --> 807.3599999999999
money out of that well just

804.16 --> 809.519
say cove it just do it for kovit right

807.36 --> 811.279
makes it easy because it's the thing now

809.519 --> 815.839
everybody knows about it

811.279 --> 815.8389999999999
who's gonna say no

817.04 --> 822.24
right so i think that it's just a lot of

820.88 --> 824.639
that it's just people

822.24 --> 826.839
using the new narrative to do what they

824.639 --> 829.839
were already doing

826.839 --> 843.839
right

829.839 --> 843.839
this is just an easy excuse

861.92 --> 866.4799999999999
what i personally find a lot weirder is

864.24 --> 870.0
that

866.48 --> 873.44
these things are just you like

870.0 --> 876.48
the narrative the power

873.44 --> 881.519
yeah the the imposed powers

876.48 --> 884.16
are just taken like even though

881.519 --> 884.9590000000001
those same people should be well aware

884.16 --> 888.0
in general

884.959 --> 890.399
that it is all nonsense

888.0 --> 893.519
so it's just kind of telling and

890.399 --> 893.519
disappointing maybe

893.68 --> 897.279
and a little creepy that just like all

895.92 --> 901.12
this [ __ ] has come

897.279 --> 903.92
afloat through media and that just

901.12 --> 904.48
groups out there like they're doing it

903.92 --> 907.279
anyway

904.48 --> 908.88
it's like they don't care they don't

907.279 --> 912.48
care whether it is all fake

908.88 --> 914.959
it's just the new sticker

912.48 --> 916.9590000000001
you put on whatever on top of whatever

914.959 --> 919.199
you're doing

916.959 --> 922.079
and it seems to work so easy it's like

919.199 --> 926.3199999999999
the power structure

922.079 --> 929.4399999999999
and financial systems and everything

926.32 --> 931.1990000000001
is being adapted to it so why wouldn't

929.44 --> 934.5600000000001
you if it's really easy

931.199 --> 938.8389999999999
right despite that it is so

934.56 --> 940.88
blatantly centered around complete fake

938.839 --> 942.8800000000001
reasons

940.88 --> 946.399
about something that's literally become

942.88 --> 946.399
been conjured out of nowhere

946.48 --> 950.8000000000001
because i think that most people that

948.32 --> 954.72
even abuse their

950.8 --> 956.959
yeah try to use covet to do their thing

954.72 --> 960.24
they probably know it's completely fake

956.959 --> 960.2399999999999
and they're doing it anyway

960.959 --> 965.1199999999999
because taking a position of kofi denial

964.24 --> 968.32
might get them

965.12 --> 970.16
into trouble on the on the higher

968.32 --> 974.639
platform

970.16 --> 976.7199999999999
against i don't know corporations

974.639 --> 978.16
all over the world and just other

976.72 --> 981.36
governments

978.16 --> 981.759
it's like staking a stand against it is

981.36 --> 984.16
much

981.759 --> 986.24
tougher than just kind of like oh great

984.16 --> 988.56
this is the new [ __ ]

986.24 --> 991.279
and just use it even though you know

988.56 --> 991.279
it's [ __ ]

994.839 --> 997.839
right

1001.04 --> 1004.56
it's like the new story setting for the

1003.759 --> 1011.839
game

1004.56 --> 1011.8389999999999
the game of the world

1014.639 --> 1020.32
and the people's breaking point ain't

1016.72 --> 1020.32
far away that's for sure

1022.0 --> 1026.319
or people are being pushed very far

1032.0 --> 1036.839
i i'm just mostly staring at it from a

1035.6 --> 1041.4389999999999
distance a bit

1036.839 --> 1043.839
because in a way like i've been

1041.439 --> 1045.6000000000001
wanting to basically get it going and

1043.839 --> 1047.76
get it over with

1045.6 --> 1048.8799999999999
like in my yeah in the back of my mind

1047.76 --> 1052.08
in my feelings

1048.88 --> 1053.44
a lot and i've expressed that but i

1052.08 --> 1056.32
really do wonder like

1053.44 --> 1058.16
would it naturally happen even if i stay

1056.32 --> 1061.84
out of it

1058.16 --> 1065.2
or are people really stuck

1061.84 --> 1067.84
are they really stuck in their stress

1065.2 --> 1070.559
and they don't really know a way out or

1067.84 --> 1070.559
they're afraid

1073.679 --> 1076.64
i'm not too sure

1079.52 --> 1083.039
but i think also that as the pressure it

1081.919 --> 1086.48
is upped

1083.039 --> 1087.919
that yeah more people in general will

1086.48 --> 1090.4
suffer under it and

1087.919 --> 1091.919
that will also be people in government

1090.4 --> 1094.48
will just

1091.919 --> 1095.2800000000002
feel the consequences they will also

1094.48 --> 1097.3600000000001
have

1095.28 --> 1099.28
opportunities to do their own research

1097.36 --> 1103.12
so unless they are like

1099.28 --> 1106.3999999999999
some kind of fanaticist about it

1103.12 --> 1107.6
and are not listening just doubling down

1106.4 --> 1110.48
on it

1107.6 --> 1110.48
with all their might

1110.72 --> 1115.3600000000001
oh wait yeah if they're doubling down in

1113.28 --> 1117.84
it they're not gonna listen but if

1115.36 --> 1118.559
in general i think that most people

1117.84 --> 1121.4399999999998
still

1118.559 --> 1122.0
do try to do their job have an open mind

1121.44 --> 1126.559
and they will

1122.0 --> 1129.039
just learn like this is bad

1126.559 --> 1131.76
doesn't seem to be any information

1129.039 --> 1135.039
presenting itself that

1131.76 --> 1137.44
makes it worth it and then at some point

1135.039 --> 1139.919
it's not the bottom

1137.44 --> 1141.8400000000001
people that are gonna break it seems

1139.919 --> 1145.1200000000001
more logical that it's the people

1141.84 --> 1146.799
in government and like closer to power

1145.12 --> 1148.1599999999999
positions are the ones that are gonna

1146.799 --> 1151.28
break because

1148.16 --> 1153.44
they will feel like everybody expecting

1151.28 --> 1155.84
that it's like they can potentially do

1153.44 --> 1158.72
something about they know it's wrong

1155.84 --> 1160.6399999999999
so what are they gonna do are they gonna

1158.72 --> 1163.039
dethrone the people that are

1160.64 --> 1164.88
championing this this covet policy

1163.039 --> 1169.039
nonsense

1164.88 --> 1171.0390000000002
or is it just gonna stay in place so i

1169.039 --> 1173.12
until like literally everything

1171.039 --> 1176.559
completely crashes

1173.12 --> 1179.4399999999998
and then all hell breaks loose

1176.559 --> 1179.9189999999999
just a lot of people just completely i

1179.44 --> 1182.4
don't know

1179.919 --> 1184.4
poor and homeless out of nowhere when

1182.4 --> 1187.919
everything was doing just great

1184.4 --> 1192.4
and thriving two years before that

1187.919 --> 1195.039
or something right

1192.4 --> 1197.679
that's going to leave a big mark so i

1195.039 --> 1197.679
just think that

1198.559 --> 1202.3999999999999
it only makes sense that the more

1200.559 --> 1206.0
aggravating

1202.4 --> 1210.159
the policy implementation

1206.0 --> 1213.2
is the closer to the decision

1210.159 --> 1215.3600000000001
structure the people are going to have

1213.2 --> 1217.2
urges to resist and stop it and they

1215.36 --> 1217.52
might be able to they might have even

1217.2 --> 1220.64
been

1217.52 --> 1224.48
planning to trust the plan but their

1220.64 --> 1226.5590000000002
own little plan they're just waiting

1224.48 --> 1228.64
for the momentum for the right time to

1226.559 --> 1230.96
basically do it and then switch it

1228.64 --> 1230.96
around

1231.28 --> 1235.36
but i wonder like how far will that take

1233.679 --> 1238.5590000000002
and what are they waiting on

1235.36 --> 1241.36
you see because seriously

1238.559 --> 1241.9189999999999
things can sometimes just suddenly turn

1241.36 --> 1245.039
right

1241.919 --> 1246.0800000000002
around but only if it was very carefully

1245.039 --> 1248.96
planned

1246.08 --> 1249.9189999999999
and then usually those plans involve

1248.96 --> 1252.96
secret

1249.919 --> 1255.3600000000001
moments that have been foreseen that

1252.96 --> 1255.3600000000001
will come

1256.88 --> 1260.4
so it is like part of the plan and just

1259.52 --> 1263.039
the the

1260.4 --> 1263.679
you know the planning ahead into the

1263.039 --> 1267.36
future

1263.679 --> 1267.3600000000001
thing the documents

1273.6 --> 1278.3999999999999
right so my advice is definitely not to

1277.12 --> 1280.9599999999998
just trust the plan

1278.4 --> 1282.24
and pretend like everything is going to

1280.96 --> 1284.72
continue the way

1282.24 --> 1286.48
it did because that's seems to be

1284.72 --> 1288.32
completely out of the picture like

1286.48 --> 1291.84
everything is going to transform one way

1288.32 --> 1291.84
or another

1294.159 --> 1297.7600000000002
and like there doesn't seem to be any

1296.48 --> 1301.52
viable outcome

1297.76 --> 1303.76
in the sense that oh the covet is undone

1301.52 --> 1305.52
and then all the people that lost their

1303.76 --> 1307.28
businesses and all that are just going

1305.52 --> 1310.799
to get a refund

1307.28 --> 1313.6
that seems extremely unlikely

1310.799 --> 1314.799
and if that were to happen with what

1313.6 --> 1319.84
consequence

1314.799 --> 1319.84
like under what condition right

1320.0 --> 1324.08
and is that condition going to be on the

1322.32 --> 1327.4399999999998
same

1324.08 --> 1329.76
in the same little corner

1327.44 --> 1333.8400000000001
that also has forwarded all this covet

1329.76 --> 1333.84
nonsense it's going to be some extremely

1333.88 --> 1342.3200000000002
undesirable consequence for just getting

1339.039 --> 1347.679
yeah damages back all that see so you

1342.32 --> 1351.12
you don't really know

1347.679 --> 1352.88
but therefore it's much wiser to just

1351.12 --> 1355.36
kind of like have an attitude of take

1352.88 --> 1360.0
the damage and just build up

1355.36 --> 1364.0
a new from a more

1360.0 --> 1364.0
self-sufficient vantage point

1365.44 --> 1375.8400000000001
less easy more durable

1399.44 --> 1402.77
the lie is so big that it is baffling

1401.919 --> 1405.6000000000001
well

1402.77 --> 1408.0
[Music]

1405.6 --> 1408.6399999999999
i'm just wondering what is it what is

1408.0 --> 1412.0
really

1408.64 --> 1412.0
keeping it in place

1413.919 --> 1420.72
if if there's so many disadvantages

1417.679 --> 1423.919
coming from it palpable as a short-term

1420.72 --> 1426.48
result then where are the advantages

1423.919 --> 1429.5200000000002
that are keeping it into place

1426.48 --> 1432.32
i have to understand how that works

1429.52 --> 1434.1589999999999
like where is money being made really or

1432.32 --> 1435.6789999999999
has the money already be made and is

1434.159 --> 1440.7990000000002
this

1435.679 --> 1440.799
just more like getting rid of loose ends

1441.36 --> 1447.4399999999998
afterward like

1444.96 --> 1448.64
because if you want to stop it you're

1447.44 --> 1452.159
going to have to

1448.64 --> 1453.8400000000001
stop making it profitable because that's

1452.159 --> 1456.88
really the only thing that

1453.84 --> 1458.8799999999999
actually drives things is is the

1456.88 --> 1461.919
that yeah that there is some kind of

1458.88 --> 1461.919
thing to be gained

1468.08 --> 1473.84
on the short term

1489.2 --> 1493.1200000000001
yeah and by the way the problem also is

1491.76 --> 1496.0
is that

1493.12 --> 1497.1999999999998
and people probably don't realize this

1496.0 --> 1501.76
is that because

1497.2 --> 1505.039
of the apparent success the success

1501.76 --> 1509.44
of the implementation of these this new

1505.039 --> 1509.44
thing this hype the kovitz situation

1509.48 --> 1516.0
unfortunately this is a huge

1512.32 --> 1518.3999999999999
unfortunate for humanity because of its

1516.0 --> 1521.84
success it's extremely

1518.4 --> 1525.919
likely that in the future

1521.84 --> 1525.9189999999999
it's going to be retried

1526.559 --> 1533.279
because of the success of it because

1530.64 --> 1534.24
it's halted a lot of things it's not

1533.279 --> 1543.84
easy to just

1534.24 --> 1547.1200000000001
overturn it right that's the problem

1543.84 --> 1550.08
like all we learned about how fake it is

1547.12 --> 1553.12
and everything about it

1550.08 --> 1556.1589999999999
is that enough to prevent it from

1553.12 --> 1556.6399999999999
them just pulling it again and us having

1556.159 --> 1559.1200000000001
to do

1556.64 --> 1560.96
the same [ __ ] over again from yeah do

1559.12 --> 1564.08
the research figure out why it's fake

1560.96 --> 1567.76
and still not be able to stop it see

1564.08 --> 1570.24
that's the problem how can this [ __ ]

1567.76 --> 1571.52
unroll with all its falsities and be

1570.24 --> 1576.0
unstoppable

1571.52 --> 1579.039
that is the main problem

1576.0 --> 1582.64
how is are they able to just

1579.039 --> 1586.0
do this just do this despite

1582.64 --> 1588.88
how incredibly false

1586.0 --> 1591.44
and erroneous it all is how is this

1588.88 --> 1591.44
possible

1593.679 --> 1601.279
i think there is the biggest challenge

1597.919 --> 1601.279
to figure that one out

1607.52 --> 1616.0
and i think also that yeah

1612.52 --> 1619.6
centralization reliance is a big

1616.0 --> 1623.44
influence it is because of connecting

1619.6 --> 1624.08
everything making it into a unified

1623.44 --> 1627.8400000000001
system

1624.08 --> 1627.84
for efficiency

1628.64 --> 1637.2
kind of like yeah the new world order

1633.679 --> 1640.5590000000002
global government connecting it

1637.2 --> 1644.0
into a unified system well then

1640.559 --> 1646.6399999999999
the more unified the bigger

1644.0 --> 1646.64
the more

1647.2 --> 1653.8400000000001
power errors or basically corruptions

1650.64 --> 1655.919
could devastate everything the more

1653.84 --> 1659.36
centralized all the power is

1655.919 --> 1663.039
the more easy it becomes to wreck it all

1659.36 --> 1663.039
out of a corrupt act you see

1667.679 --> 1683.8400000000001
a gaining wisdom to see you in chat

1694.84 --> 1697.84
hmm

1708.84 --> 1711.84
so

1722.84 --> 1729.6
so

1725.76 --> 1729.6
all right here we go again come on don't

1737.679 --> 1743.6000000000001
what do you mean nowhere is safe this

1740.48 --> 1746.48
that's a frame of mind

1743.6 --> 1746.48
you shouldn't be

1746.96 --> 1750.8400000000001
just driving yourself in a ditch like

1749.279 --> 1754.96
that constantly

1750.84 --> 1757.6
like i'm not doing that

1754.96 --> 1760.32
and i'm facing the [ __ ] that's happening

1757.6 --> 1760.32
just as much

1764.399 --> 1768.2399999999998
yeah but no but it's not safe and well

1766.88 --> 1772.3200000000002
why didn't you just

1768.24 --> 1775.039
say you can't escape it

1772.32 --> 1776.96
that's different that's not implying

1775.039 --> 1779.36
safety because

1776.96 --> 1781.52
not safety it's just you have to deal

1779.36 --> 1784.4799999999998
with it

1781.52 --> 1785.679
you must deal with it one way or the

1784.48 --> 1788.559
other

1785.679 --> 1789.76
doesn't mean it's not safe that it being

1788.559 --> 1793.2
supposedly not

1789.76 --> 1795.84
safe is part of their spell

1793.2 --> 1798.0800000000002
of trying to convince you it's not safe

1795.84 --> 1800.24
don't let that rub off on you

1798.08 --> 1802.1589999999999
like there is no covet it is safe

1800.24 --> 1804.0
there's it's just a cold just like it

1802.159 --> 1808.64
has always been

1804.0 --> 1813.12
it's just that

1808.64 --> 1817.2
yeah if you buy into it somehow

1813.12 --> 1817.1999999999998
then things become not safe

1818.88 --> 1823.8400000000001
yeah the vaccine is never going to be

1820.96 --> 1823.8400000000001
made compulsory

1826.48 --> 1831.3600000000001
because then yeah then a revolution

1829.52 --> 1834.399
happens

1831.36 --> 1836.24
like a real one not just like oh

1834.399 --> 1838.6399999999999
we're just going to protest and who

1836.24 --> 1841.2
knows what no no

1838.64 --> 1842.7990000000002
if people are just going to be murdered

1841.2 --> 1844.32
which is effectively going to happen

1842.799 --> 1845.9189999999999
it's like oh you see people going to

1844.32 --> 1848.48
somebody's door

1845.919 --> 1849.6000000000001
and the next day they're dead yeah yeah

1848.48 --> 1851.84
well

1849.6 --> 1854.799
people are not just gonna sit around

1851.84 --> 1858.24
waiting to get killed

1854.799 --> 1860.24
when it gets real when it's palpable

1858.24 --> 1861.44
and it's your neighbor and [ __ ] right so

1860.24 --> 1864.48
at some point

1861.44 --> 1868.3990000000001
no they know this the designers

1864.48 --> 1870.919
of this game know this they can't

1868.399 --> 1872.08
make it mandatory but they can drive you

1870.919 --> 1877.6000000000001
completely

1872.08 --> 1879.6
nuts with the idea of it the suggestion

1877.6 --> 1880.9599999999998
so that you're just breaking yourself up

1879.6 --> 1884.48
under the stress of that

1880.96 --> 1886.48
right they can do that so don't let it

1884.48 --> 1888.32
because they can't implement something

1886.48 --> 1889.44
like that if that would happen it's

1888.32 --> 1892.8799999999999
literally just

1889.44 --> 1894.799
okay let yeah public execution of

1892.88 --> 1896.96
government of the public right that's

1894.799 --> 1899.519
just

1896.96 --> 1900.799
yeah if that happens it's all over

1899.519 --> 1903.6
everything is over

1900.799 --> 1904.24
everything then it becomes savage murder

1903.6 --> 1907.84
time

1904.24 --> 1911.679
right so no there's too

1907.84 --> 1914.6399999999999
much still going too many needs

1911.679 --> 1915.1200000000001
for the things to still go for that to

1914.64 --> 1918.24
happen

1915.12 --> 1921.84
ever they can drive you nuts with it

1918.24 --> 1921.84
if you allow them to

1927.519 --> 1931.44
for travel what what you think they're

1929.76 --> 1933.679
going to be checkpoints that are just

1931.44 --> 1936.559
going to forcefully vaccinate you if you

1933.679 --> 1939.8400000000001
if you want to pass

1936.559 --> 1939.84
well that would be

1939.919 --> 1943.039
that would be marked up as next that

1942.559 --> 1945.6789999999999
that's

1943.039 --> 1948.1589999999999
just ex that is already really bad

1945.679 --> 1949.76
that's one step away

1948.159 --> 1951.3600000000001
from coming to your door and just

1949.76 --> 1955.279
forcing you like that

1951.36 --> 1958.399
right i don't think that's gonna happen

1955.279 --> 1960.08
they are there are already checkpoints

1958.399 --> 1961.6
in spain what does that mean

1960.08 --> 1963.9189999999999
checkpoints where they're going to test

1961.6 --> 1967.36
you for kovit

1963.919 --> 1971.3600000000001
sure that's not going to be

1967.36 --> 1974.8799999999999
mandatory vaccination checkpoints right

1971.36 --> 1977.36
so you're panicking right now

1974.88 --> 1979.519
here we go again and i want you to stop

1977.36 --> 1984.399
doing that

1979.519 --> 1984.3990000000001
you're panicking don't do that

1986.559 --> 1992.32
yes stop it it's unhealthy you're

1989.039 --> 1992.32
effectively squirting

1994.96 --> 1998.08
you don't need to panic like that if

1997.6 --> 2001.84
that

1998.08 --> 2005.519
level of heavy authoritarianism

2001.84 --> 2006.399
and just yeah attack on the public

2005.519 --> 2009.76
happens

2006.399 --> 2012.08
then you'll know and

2009.76 --> 2015.279
yeah and doesn't mean you have to fall

2012.08 --> 2018.399
right you have to step into it

2015.279 --> 2020.0
nobody's forcing you to do that

2018.399 --> 2021.76
you have to adapt a little have to

2020.0 --> 2023.84
change the plans

2021.76 --> 2025.76
what you're doing like a lot of people

2023.84 --> 2028.0
in the world have to change their plans

2025.76 --> 2030.64
right now they already had to

2028.0 --> 2032.96
they already are because everything's

2030.64 --> 2034.48
changing because of the stupid

2032.96 --> 2037.1200000000001
rules and the lockdowns and the

2034.48 --> 2037.1200000000001
shutdowns

2038.72 --> 2042.96
nobody is going to kill you if they

2042.159 --> 2045.679
would

2042.96 --> 2046.72
then everything has gone to [ __ ] yeah

2045.679 --> 2048.96
it's unfair well

2046.72 --> 2051.2
life is [ __ ] unfair it always has

2048.96 --> 2055.599
been you're now just waking up to the

2051.2 --> 2055.5989999999997
fact of that it's that simple

2059.599 --> 2063.599
sorry to be hard on you like that but

2064.079 --> 2067.76
you need to stop the panicking

2069.44 --> 2075.679
panicking is not good for anything just

2071.76 --> 2078.42
have to step back and calm down

2075.679 --> 2083.329
look what you can do

2078.42 --> 2083.329
[Music]

2087.04 --> 2089.839
right

2090.399 --> 2094.159
it's like this if you have anxiety on

2093.28 --> 2095.8390000000004
your chest

2094.159 --> 2098.079
and you need to share it that's one

2095.839 --> 2101.359
thing that's okay it's like

2098.079 --> 2102.5600000000004
just like help i need i feel shitty

2101.359 --> 2105.92
about this

2102.56 --> 2108.32
but don't let it continue on

2105.92 --> 2110.4
that's where you have to stop it and

2108.32 --> 2112.0
that's not like oh you take some

2110.4 --> 2114.4
i don't know some pharmaceutical or

2112.0 --> 2117.839
whatever no you have to in your mind

2114.4 --> 2117.839
stop that

2118.16 --> 2124.48
it's no it's nothing productive about

2121.28 --> 2126.8
dwelling on panic and anxiety

2124.48 --> 2128.079
nothing you have to stop that you have

2126.8 --> 2130.8
to just deflect it

2128.079 --> 2133.28
onto something more productive something

2130.8 --> 2133.28
smaller

2134.72 --> 2139.52
you know for me i have

2137.92 --> 2141.04
i don't know if other people have it too

2139.52 --> 2142.8
it's like a mechanism where

2141.04 --> 2145.04
it's just like if it's out of your hands

2142.8 --> 2147.599
i just resort back to looking at

2145.04 --> 2149.44
like it more like i did when as i was a

2147.599 --> 2149.92
little kid because as a little kid your

2149.44 --> 2152.88
word is

2149.92 --> 2154.64
really small and if you just accept like

2152.88 --> 2157.599
okay

2154.64 --> 2158.24
you can live in a smaller world where

2157.599 --> 2161.599
you just

2158.24 --> 2164.3199999999997
don't latch onto everything and then

2161.599 --> 2165.04
yeah you're relatively untouched as i

2164.32 --> 2167.28
was

2165.04 --> 2168.72
up until i basically started reaching

2167.28 --> 2173.8390000000004
out more and getting caught up in the

2168.72 --> 2173.839
world situations

2175.44 --> 2180.88
so yeah if the world is just making you

2178.48 --> 2180.88
panic

2181.52 --> 2201.839
don't let it

2186.079 --> 2201.8390000000004
stay calm

2204.88 --> 2209.04
okay dorian gray hello

2211.52 --> 2216.56
you will force them to give it to you no

2214.079 --> 2216.5600000000004
no no

2218.56 --> 2222.24
look if some people up there are really

2221.52 --> 2225.04
like a

2222.24 --> 2227.04
panic panic ah we have to force facts

2225.04 --> 2228.88
yeah if they do that

2227.04 --> 2230.4
it might happen at first then they're

2228.88 --> 2233.2000000000003
going to be arrested

2230.4 --> 2234.8
literally it's like oh oh oh you for

2233.2 --> 2237.68
some delusional reason

2234.8 --> 2238.32
are effectively going to attack people

2237.68 --> 2241.44
have people

2238.32 --> 2245.92
attacked by government yeah that's

2241.44 --> 2249.04
where it stops like no matter the games

2245.92 --> 2252.2400000000002
there is like the law the real

2249.04 --> 2255.68
law underneath it all the natural law

2252.24 --> 2259.2
and there's just certain things like

2255.68 --> 2262.7999999999997
it's all games mind games

2259.2 --> 2271.839
but the law remains the real

2262.8 --> 2271.8390000000004
law understand

2273.2 --> 2278.24
now whether that law is enforced or and

2275.839 --> 2285.839
realized is another thing but it's there

2278.24 --> 2285.839
and you can actually use that

2293.119 --> 2296.96
what if you can't shop and travel oh

2295.92 --> 2300.2400000000002
really

2296.96 --> 2303.2
no no if if nobody can shop and travel

2300.24 --> 2304.64
then everybody's gonna get some tools

2303.2 --> 2306.7999999999997
from their kitchen

2304.64 --> 2307.92
and from their garage and pay a little

2306.8 --> 2310.96
visit

2307.92 --> 2315.52
to a certain group of people

2310.96 --> 2315.52
that's what's gonna happen right

2315.839 --> 2323.92
no it's very unrealistic

2320.32 --> 2324.6400000000003
if an entire mob yeah it's some freaking

2323.92 --> 2327.359
supposed

2324.64 --> 2329.04
govi checkpoint yeah what what what if

2327.359 --> 2331.5989999999997
like a couple of thousand p

2329.04 --> 2333.119
angry mob people just come walk you

2331.599 --> 2334.079
think they're just gonna freaking shoot

2333.119 --> 2336.88
them

2334.079 --> 2337.6800000000003
think that's gonna happen well that

2336.88 --> 2342.079
would be an

2337.68 --> 2345.359
ultimate disaster ultimate disaster

2342.079 --> 2348.48
that would happen to them

2345.359 --> 2350.16
so this is being extremely unrealistic

2348.48 --> 2354.44
you've been watching too much fear

2350.16 --> 2358.24
porn too many uh world war ii

2354.44 --> 2361.359
concentration camp movies way too much

2358.24 --> 2364.7999999999997
and you're panic fantasizing now about

2361.359 --> 2366.64
being in that ultimate deadly position

2364.8 --> 2368.88
and there's no way out and it's all

2366.64 --> 2372.48
[ __ ] doom that's not there yet

2368.88 --> 2372.48
it's still just a spell

2373.52 --> 2377.839
right there's still the real law

2378.0 --> 2383.76
just you buying into it right now and

2381.68 --> 2386.3999999999996
conjuring creating your own doom

2383.76 --> 2386.4
scenario

2389.92 --> 2411.839
don't get caught up in panic spirals

2394.72 --> 2411.839
never do that and it's for all of you

2457.2 --> 2467.839
right so

2461.119 --> 2467.839
don't panic

2478.839 --> 2481.839
so

2495.359 --> 2503.2
oh and by the way i've heard interesting

2499.04 --> 2504.96
things also i heard it

2503.2 --> 2506.8799999999997
on the own benjamin i think it was

2504.96 --> 2508.8
yesterday or the day before

2506.88 --> 2510.8
but i also heard through other people

2508.8 --> 2514.079
that for example in italy

2510.8 --> 2517.8390000000004
there's like restaurant owners that are

2514.079 --> 2520.5600000000004
just like conspiring

2517.839 --> 2521.2799999999997
and they're just breaking the covered

2520.56 --> 2523.359
rules like

2521.28 --> 2525.52
nope we're not doing this [ __ ] anymore

2523.359 --> 2528.56
they're just opening up

2525.52 --> 2530.88
and they're doing it their own way like

2528.56 --> 2533.599
no masks anything just restaurants

2530.88 --> 2535.119
inside no masks nothing no social

2533.599 --> 2538.56
distance nothing

2535.119 --> 2541.6800000000003
it's just they're just doing it so

2538.56 --> 2545.52
if they can do it that means

2541.68 --> 2548.0789999999997
it is doable might be not super easy

2545.52 --> 2550.48
straightforward but it is doable and hey

2548.079 --> 2554.0
i suggested this a long time ago

2550.48 --> 2556.56
it's like yeah just just do it anyway

2554.0 --> 2557.68
or yeah figure it out with lawyers how

2556.56 --> 2561.04
are you going to do it

2557.68 --> 2561.04
to just avoid

2562.72 --> 2567.9199999999996
getting fined or if you're getting fined

2566.0 --> 2571.359
figure out can you just ignore

2567.92 --> 2574.7200000000003
it can you just play a long-term game

2571.359 --> 2576.7999999999997
and just not pay it like how would you

2574.72 --> 2579.2
get through that

2576.8 --> 2581.599
well apparently these italian restaurant

2579.2 --> 2584.3999999999996
owners figured a way out to do it

2581.599 --> 2585.2000000000003
so maybe they just do it by having all

2584.4 --> 2587.359
their own

2585.2 --> 2588.64
personal farm so they're not even

2587.359 --> 2592.16
dependent on

2588.64 --> 2594.56
logistics and money so they can just

2592.16 --> 2594.56
do it

2596.319 --> 2600.48
because they're not dependent on the

2598.4 --> 2603.44
system that will punish them for not

2600.48 --> 2603.44
following the rules

2604.0 --> 2607.92
well it's interesting i definitely want

2607.119 --> 2610.4
to

2607.92 --> 2612.64
keep track of of that situation there in

2610.4 --> 2614.319
italy like how they're doing that

2612.64 --> 2620.72
how they're pulling through it it's very

2614.319 --> 2624.0
interesting that that's happening

2620.72 --> 2626.64
make influenza creek

2624.0 --> 2626.64
no thanks

2631.44 --> 2649.839
it's just a freaking cold

2634.48 --> 2649.839
don't worry about it

2670.16 --> 2674.56
well unfortunate reality it's it's it's

2672.8 --> 2676.2400000000002
interesting you mentioned that the right

2674.56 --> 2677.52
to bear arms as

2676.24 --> 2678.8799999999997
it means to defend against the

2677.52 --> 2680.48
tyrannical government was made

2678.88 --> 2683.28
irrelevant when technology

2680.48 --> 2685.52
progressed beyond the musketing cannibal

2683.28 --> 2689.599
not true

2685.52 --> 2692.8
it actually reaches way further

2689.599 --> 2693.6800000000003
than that because it doesn't even

2692.8 --> 2698.5600000000004
necessarily

2693.68 --> 2701.7599999999998
in my opinion have to apply to weaponry

2698.56 --> 2705.839
but it can pretty much mean anything

2701.76 --> 2705.8390000000004
also just technology technology

2707.52 --> 2712.319
ability ability to have an influence

2713.92 --> 2722.64
to outdo the government

2718.0 --> 2725.04
in some way that should be possible

2722.64 --> 2727.68
and i think it is it's like people can

2725.04 --> 2729.599
just figure it out on their own and

2727.68 --> 2731.44
eventually end up with something

2729.599 --> 2733.52
technology or technique

2731.44 --> 2737.44
that is better than what the government

2733.52 --> 2739.68
uses and that way outshine them

2737.44 --> 2743.28
[Music]

2739.68 --> 2747.839
and even stare things around

2743.28 --> 2747.8390000000004
because they're better

2749.52 --> 2761.839
getting the story way to save the world

2751.359 --> 2761.839
that it's

2765.839 --> 2769.2
can i tell that story

2769.65 --> 2772.8
[Music]

2772.88 --> 2779.839
well i can tell you that in retrospect

2777.28 --> 2780.48
it being part of vision my vision and

2779.839 --> 2783.2
all that

2780.48 --> 2784.2400000000002
that's where i came where where i got

2783.2 --> 2789.1189999999997
that from

2784.24 --> 2792.56
i don't exactly know what that all was

2789.119 --> 2794.319
like how to interpret it now

2792.56 --> 2795.599
because at the time i took it all very

2794.319 --> 2797.68
literal

2795.599 --> 2799.2000000000003
but i've learned so much about my

2797.68 --> 2800.48
visions what they are what they

2799.2 --> 2803.4399999999996
represent

2800.48 --> 2803.839
that it may have simply been that in

2803.44 --> 2807.44
that

2803.839 --> 2807.44
journey i took on

2807.92 --> 2815.2000000000003
that goal as it were to

2811.76 --> 2816.2400000000002
guide me as a frequency through the

2815.2 --> 2818.319
entire process

2816.24 --> 2821.52
of just like okay if i'm going to do

2818.319 --> 2826.4
something i'm going to do that

2821.52 --> 2826.4
because of the world just getting worse

2826.48 --> 2834.079
and yeah so

2831.599 --> 2834.8
all i know is that for whatever

2834.079 --> 2837.599
influence i

2834.8 --> 2838.8
seem to have if i've effectively saved

2837.599 --> 2842.8
the world

2838.8 --> 2845.2000000000003
it's been in ways that you'll never know

2842.8 --> 2846.0
because it already changes things that i

2845.2 --> 2849.04
foresaw

2846.0 --> 2850.4
would happen that i basically helped

2849.04 --> 2853.52
nudge

2850.4 --> 2854.64
early on before it would happen because

2853.52 --> 2857.04
i had this

2854.64 --> 2858.16
well this there seemed to have this

2857.04 --> 2861.599
magnificent

2858.16 --> 2863.92
insight on time throughout time

2861.599 --> 2866.0
than to just have slight alterations in

2863.92 --> 2868.559
order to steer it slightly different so

2866.0 --> 2872.24
that it wouldn't happen

2868.559 --> 2876.0
but we'll never know or even see

2872.24 --> 2877.4399999999996
the value of it now that it's all

2876.0 --> 2880.8
enrolled

2877.44 --> 2886.8
so in a way i can't tell you

2880.8 --> 2889.6800000000003
because it wouldn't make sense to you

2886.8 --> 2891.2000000000003
like a time traveling wizard yes like a

2889.68 --> 2895.04
time traveling wizard

2891.2 --> 2901.839
indeed but time traveling only in spirit

2895.04 --> 2901.839
not physically

2910.72 --> 2918.0789999999997
what why yeah it is amazing

2914.559 --> 2921.3590000000004
it was absolutely mind-boggling amazing

2918.079 --> 2923.3590000000004
and terrifying and it made me feel

2921.359 --> 2926.319
extremely guilty

2923.359 --> 2927.359
because i had a sensation that i had a

2926.319 --> 2929.44
lot of power

2927.359 --> 2931.5989999999997
whether that is real or not i will never

2929.44 --> 2934.88
really know

2931.599 --> 2937.839
but also just an inability to change

2934.88 --> 2937.839
things for the better

2938.559 --> 2944.2400000000002
in a lot of ways like the main crux

2942.4 --> 2945.76
of my problem is that i couldn't

2944.24 --> 2950.5589999999997
convince the world

2945.76 --> 2952.6400000000003
to stop making terrible mistakes

2950.559 --> 2954.8
couldn't prevent people from doing the

2952.64 --> 2958.24
stupidest things imaginable

2954.8 --> 2960.2400000000002
i think that was the main axis

2958.24 --> 2962.24
of the problem that i ended up facing

2960.24 --> 2966.64
that i did not foresee because i

2962.24 --> 2968.839
at the start of it in young life even

2966.64 --> 2970.24
thought that everybody would have that

2968.839 --> 2972.64
same

2970.24 --> 2973.7599999999998
frequency in that same approach in life

2972.64 --> 2976.8799999999997
as i did

2973.76 --> 2977.76
and i was wrong and i didn't i hadn't

2976.88 --> 2982.1600000000003
foreseen

2977.76 --> 2983.2000000000003
that so eventually ended up in that

2982.16 --> 2985.5989999999997
magnificent

2983.2 --> 2988.0
or seemingly magnificent process in the

2985.599 --> 2988.0
vision

2988.48 --> 2993.68
just working on damage control that's it

2991.599 --> 2996.2400000000002
it's like how long can i prevent the

2993.68 --> 2998.319
world from absolutely destroying itself

2996.24 --> 3000.319
through the people that are doubling

2998.319 --> 3002.96
down willingly on stupidity and cannot

3000.319 --> 3002.96
be this way

3003.52 --> 3009.7599999999998
right so there you go here

3006.559 --> 3013.52
see you don't have to tell a troll to

3009.76 --> 3015.2000000000003
piss off because they think

3013.52 --> 3016.72
see they don't even know what they're

3015.2 --> 3019.52
echoing

3016.72 --> 3021.2
you know when i said this about this oh

3019.52 --> 3022.96
i saved the world back then

3021.2 --> 3025.52
everybody's in the troll community was

3022.96 --> 3027.599
like oh that's so funny that's so stupid

3025.52 --> 3030.0
so delusional

3027.599 --> 3032.079
and they've been echoing it on for a

3030.0 --> 3034.48
very long time thinking it is some kind

3032.079 --> 3036.559
of a weapon against me to tame me

3034.48 --> 3038.48
to oh look at the craziness from the

3036.559 --> 3040.6400000000003
past that we can

3038.48 --> 3043.44
remind everybody how crazy our witness

3040.64 --> 3043.44
oh guess what

3045.119 --> 3052.0
i back then could not bear

3049.2 --> 3052.5589999999997
the radiance the painful radiance from

3052.0 --> 3056.079
what i

3052.559 --> 3058.1600000000003
kind of learned about it back then

3056.079 --> 3060.0
and that's why i kind of like didn't

3058.16 --> 3062.48
really want to talk about it

3060.0 --> 3063.92
now that you brought it up back up again

3062.48 --> 3066.4
can much more calmly

3063.92 --> 3068.48
explain what that all was and that it

3066.4 --> 3071.92
was absolutely magnificent

3068.48 --> 3073.359
in ways and scary and that i've been

3071.92 --> 3083.839
through something pretty

3073.359 --> 3083.839
extreme like that in spirit

3088.0 --> 3092.88
you know you saved no but it doesn't

3090.16 --> 3092.8799999999997
mean anything

3094.48 --> 3097.839
how can you enjoy

3098.8 --> 3102.559
the sensation of oh i saved the world

3102.16 --> 3106.48
when

3102.559 --> 3108.559
nobody knows it it doesn't mean anything

3106.48 --> 3111.119
it's like okay you can just say okay at

3108.559 --> 3114.1600000000003
least i did everything i could

3111.119 --> 3117.44
but that's not enough to

3114.16 --> 3121.839
inspire the rest of your life

3117.44 --> 3121.839
because you're supposed to do that

3122.0 --> 3126.559
you're supposed to do everything you can

3124.4 --> 3130.559
to make it all right

3126.559 --> 3132.88
right so how can i then

3130.559 --> 3134.0
have this moment where i'm not even 100

3132.88 --> 3137.28
sure

3134.0 --> 3138.16
like whether it was real or not and then

3137.28 --> 3140.079
i come out of it

3138.16 --> 3141.68
how can i use that as some kind of a

3140.079 --> 3144.1600000000003
motivation

3141.68 --> 3145.44
for the rest of my life no it was just

3144.16 --> 3153.839
it's just a huge

3145.44 --> 3153.839
challenge to my psyche

3157.52 --> 3161.92
hello by the way julio pebbin good to

3159.599 --> 3164.0
see you i'm crazy irwin

3161.92 --> 3166.079
i'm not that crazy i just been through a

3164.0 --> 3169.839
lot of crazy things

3166.079 --> 3172.0
like mentally or is that even mentally

3169.839 --> 3174.7999999999997
no because my mental cohesion has been

3172.0 --> 3178.559
very stable

3174.8 --> 3181.8390000000004
yeah the mental part right the actual

3178.559 --> 3185.119
reasoning and logic structural

3181.839 --> 3187.599
integrity of the thinking

3185.119 --> 3189.359
it's been my emotions that have been

3187.599 --> 3191.2000000000003
crazy

3189.359 --> 3192.88
because they get so extreme and then

3191.2 --> 3196.5589999999997
they change

3192.88 --> 3196.559
everything to change what i see

3198.319 --> 3203.04
thank you thank you for the two pound

3200.559 --> 3205.44
super chat donation number five

3203.04 --> 3207.2
for using your weirdest wizard skills to

3205.44 --> 3209.28
save the world

3207.2 --> 3213.4399999999996
yeah but i didn't really save it i only

3209.28 --> 3213.44
postponed its destruction slightly

3216.559 --> 3222.4
you know let's let's keep it realistic

3220.839 --> 3225.119
here

3222.4 --> 3227.04
because that's the best i could do can

3225.119 --> 3237.839
only prevent its absolute

3227.04 --> 3237.839
destruction for as long as i live

3239.52 --> 3246.319
yeah yeah here we go guys

3242.64 --> 3249.1189999999997
that's all right and hey

3246.319 --> 3250.88
who knows maybe in a few months or maybe

3249.119 --> 3254.6400000000003
a year i don't know which

3250.88 --> 3258.4
is which is it gonna be i might be

3254.64 --> 3260.5589999999997
off social welfare i might be

3258.4 --> 3262.319
and then suddenly yeah the super chat

3260.559 --> 3263.599
donations will be

3262.319 --> 3265.599
well there's still going to be i think

3263.599 --> 3279.839
35 taken off

3265.599 --> 3279.839
but they will be received so who knows

3282.24 --> 3287.1189999999997
but anyway i'm glad you're so very very

3285.52 --> 3292.48
amused that i once

3287.119 --> 3295.76
said i used like i saved the world

3292.48 --> 3295.76
what was it again that i said

3301.44 --> 3306.7200000000003
because i think i said it in a time when

3304.88 --> 3308.48
there were like trolls trying to you're

3306.72 --> 3310.3999999999996
a loser you you're not

3308.48 --> 3311.599
you're just a stupid flat earth you have

3310.4 --> 3313.6800000000003
nothing

3311.599 --> 3315.599
and then i was very triggered and that's

3313.68 --> 3317.52
why i said it because

3315.599 --> 3318.799
i was kind of dwelling on that and then

3317.52 --> 3323.2
i kind of

3318.799 --> 3325.28
yeah by accident defended myself with it

3323.2 --> 3327.7599999999998
not realizing that that's kind of silly

3325.28 --> 3327.76
to say

3329.2 --> 3334.0
like for an outsider that doesn't

3331.52 --> 3336.16
understand what i'm going through and

3334.0 --> 3338.4
does not have the faculties to even

3336.16 --> 3341.7599999999998
attempt to take it seriously

3338.4 --> 3348.079
right so that's the silly part about

3341.76 --> 3351.2000000000003
that i used that i had said that

3348.079 --> 3353.04
but what i can tell you about it is that

3351.2 --> 3355.04
back then i did not have an

3353.04 --> 3357.7599999999998
understanding of what the experience

3355.04 --> 3357.7599999999998
actually was

3357.839 --> 3362.5589999999997
and it was a lot more unnerved by it and

3360.72 --> 3365.68
a lot more haunted by

3362.559 --> 3367.28
dark spirits like interactive

3365.68 --> 3369.1189999999997
that's not just in the vision that's

3367.28 --> 3371.92
also just

3369.119 --> 3374.839
like a lot of fear and anxiety that

3371.92 --> 3377.359
would manifest in itself almost

3374.839 --> 3379.839
hallucinatory literally back then even i

3377.359 --> 3383.839
even told the story

3379.839 --> 3386.16
this was before i went on flat earth

3383.839 --> 3387.2799999999997
like i literally hallucinated one time

3386.16 --> 3390.8799999999997
about

3387.28 --> 3392.799
yeah people that were gonna get me

3390.88 --> 3394.6400000000003
like i literally saw that and i

3392.799 --> 3397.359
remembered it from a vision it totally

3394.64 --> 3397.359
freaked me out

3397.52 --> 3403.119
like seeing somebody there and then

3400.64 --> 3404.0
like literally blinking with your eyes

3403.119 --> 3405.92
and realizing that

3404.0 --> 3407.839
you're not seeing them there even though

3405.92 --> 3409.76
you just saw them there

3407.839 --> 3412.0
while not looking away or anything like

3409.76 --> 3412.0
that

3412.079 --> 3415.44
and that just freaks you out got an idea

3414.4 --> 3417.839
of like oh [ __ ]

3415.44 --> 3419.44
shadow people are coming from out of the

3417.839 --> 3421.2
other dimension and they're pulling you

3419.44 --> 3422.799
into their dimension that's kind of like

3421.2 --> 3423.7599999999998
what it felt like it's very freaky to

3422.799 --> 3426.0
experiencing

3423.76 --> 3428.4
to experience something like that but

3426.0 --> 3430.96
yeah i sought help spiritual help

3428.4 --> 3432.64
went to the church of the latter day

3430.96 --> 3435.359
saints right across

3432.64 --> 3437.2
for the first time and like help

3435.359 --> 3438.0789999999997
literally just help me i feel like i'm

3437.2 --> 3440.8799999999997
being

3438.079 --> 3443.599
haunted by devils kind of situation and

3440.88 --> 3445.359
they took that serious

3443.599 --> 3448.48
very honest and serious they just saw

3445.359 --> 3451.839
this person is very troubled

3448.48 --> 3453.44
they understood the lingo they were

3451.839 --> 3454.799
english by the way english both from

3453.44 --> 3458.4
america

3454.799 --> 3458.4
like missionaries

3458.559 --> 3462.1600000000003
from yeah from america people go all

3461.359 --> 3465.68
over the world

3462.16 --> 3467.839
and do their like one or two years

3465.68 --> 3469.5989999999997
of service in another country and just

3467.839 --> 3470.24
get to know about their culture it was

3469.599 --> 3472.799
interesting

3470.24 --> 3474.72
so they were american they gave me like

3472.799 --> 3477.839
this lay on hands blessing

3474.72 --> 3480.0
and it worked magnificently

3477.839 --> 3481.2799999999997
i remember that and after that i did not

3480.0 --> 3484.48
have that level of

3481.28 --> 3487.52
like hallucinatory hauntings

3484.48 --> 3489.839
again like never like that again

3487.52 --> 3492.24
like i have had panic situations but not

3489.839 --> 3492.24
like that

3493.92 --> 3500.7200000000003
so i was i was in pretty bad shape

3497.52 --> 3504.48
like haunted it's not mentally

3500.72 --> 3508.8799999999997
deranged but just emotionally haunted

3504.48 --> 3512.2400000000002
a lot of pain and

3508.88 --> 3513.2000000000003
bad feelings also about myself just like

3512.24 --> 3517.1189999999997
oh i'm

3513.2 --> 3520.0
i'm i'm bad i'm my very presence

3517.119 --> 3521.44
dooms the world like serious haunting

3520.0 --> 3523.68
[ __ ]

3521.44 --> 3523.68
this

3529.44 --> 3533.359
but i'm over a lot of that i worked it

3531.68 --> 3534.64
out i worked out what it was where it

3533.359 --> 3536.88
came from

3534.64 --> 3538.72
it really in a way also was a backlash

3536.88 --> 3541.6800000000003
to breaking up with my ex

3538.72 --> 3543.4399999999996
which really was very sudden to me and

3541.68 --> 3547.04
extremely shocking because i

3543.44 --> 3549.28
i didn't all in spiritually mentally

3547.04 --> 3550.72
emotionally i didn't all in with her i

3549.28 --> 3554.6400000000003
really expected that i

3550.72 --> 3555.68
could be with her the rest of my life

3554.64 --> 3558.4
which i've never

3555.68 --> 3559.5989999999997
even considered like that before with

3558.4 --> 3563.28
another person like

3559.599 --> 3563.92
i like to imagine but to actually meet

3563.28 --> 3567.599
somebody

3563.92 --> 3569.52
and then feel that that's yeah never had

3567.599 --> 3573.28
that before her

3569.52 --> 3576.48
and then bang just gone well that just

3573.28 --> 3577.6800000000003
basically broke me up in all kinds of

3576.48 --> 3580.559
ways

3577.68 --> 3582.16
and i think that these heavy and painful

3580.559 --> 3584.079
experiences

3582.16 --> 3586.0789999999997
were kind of a side effect of that

3584.079 --> 3589.04
damage that i suffered

3586.079 --> 3589.04
because of that breakup

3592.72 --> 3596.24
but at the same time just a lot of

3594.799 --> 3598.839
vision stuff also

3596.24 --> 3600.319
through i guess the breaking open of the

3598.839 --> 3603.2
hallucinatory

3600.319 --> 3603.7599999999998
probably activated my pineal gland but

3603.2 --> 3606.96
then

3603.76 --> 3607.599
just a lot of the vision memories also

3606.96 --> 3611.2
returned

3607.599 --> 3614.48
like came back in in dreams

3611.2 --> 3618.0789999999997
so it opened up that mysterious can

3614.48 --> 3620.48
that i've never even attempted to really

3618.079 --> 3622.079
look into because every time i did in

3620.48 --> 3624.72
the past

3622.079 --> 3625.52
like things would go wrong like lit like

3624.72 --> 3628.0
physically

3625.52 --> 3629.599
would go wrong it was weird it's

3628.0 --> 3633.04
something that i couldn't

3629.599 --> 3633.04
i had to keep it a secret

3634.72 --> 3641.04
like because it was too delicate

3638.079 --> 3644.0
to let other people touch it the

3641.04 --> 3644.0
experience that is

3644.24 --> 3649.16
right and i'm talking about over 20

3647.599 --> 3652.0
years ago

3649.16 --> 3655.04
24 years ago i think

3652.0 --> 3656.64
right i just had to let it rest back

3655.04 --> 3659.04
then because it was too much for

3656.64 --> 3659.04
everything

3660.319 --> 3667.359
anyway yeah so see

3663.839 --> 3668.0
here here you go again a troll comes in

3667.359 --> 3670.0
thick

3668.0 --> 3672.559
i'm going to troll or win i'm going to

3670.0 --> 3675.359
kill them something silly you said

3672.559 --> 3675.92
yeah guess what you just provided me

3675.359 --> 3678.96
with

3675.92 --> 3680.88
a half hour story of things that are

3678.96 --> 3683.839
actually kind of interesting

3680.88 --> 3685.119
to me at least i hope other people's are

3683.839 --> 3686.72
also interested

3685.119 --> 3688.559
but thank you and the super chat

3686.72 --> 3690.799
donation too so it's always fun when a

3688.559 --> 3693.3590000000004
troll tries to troll and then he ends up

3690.799 --> 3698.079
helping you

3693.359 --> 3701.2799999999997
i love the irony of that

3698.079 --> 3701.28
and i can do it

3701.839 --> 3708.48
it's it's such because i feel better now

3705.839 --> 3712.319
i literally feel better now for number

3708.48 --> 3716.319
five here having brought it up

3712.319 --> 3716.319
see you can do that too

3716.96 --> 3723.839
because a troll attack is not

3720.799 --> 3726.64
your weakness being revealed it is

3723.839 --> 3728.16
their weakness being revealed because it

3726.64 --> 3730.799
reveals their focus

3728.16 --> 3732.64
where their mindset if you learned a lot

3730.799 --> 3734.24
about how people think about things and

3732.64 --> 3735.2799999999997
respond and typically the trains of

3734.24 --> 3738.24
thought how they work

3735.28 --> 3738.7200000000003
and on certain levels then by what they

3738.24 --> 3742.24
say

3738.72 --> 3746.0789999999997
you can pin them down like oh

3742.24 --> 3746.0789999999997
so you're stuck at that point

3746.319 --> 3751.0389999999998
and then they probably think in this

3748.799 --> 3751.92
very oversimplified way about it like

3751.039 --> 3754.079
this

3751.92 --> 3755.839
well let me take the subject yet you

3754.079 --> 3759.44
thought you were trolling me with

3755.839 --> 3762.24
and let me show you what that really is

3759.44 --> 3769.839
from a more valuable perspective and

3762.24 --> 3769.839
that's what i just did

3771.039 --> 3775.44
i think that's a pretty successful

3772.96 --> 3778.319
transmutation

3775.44 --> 3783.839
spiritual transmutation would you say i

3778.319 --> 3783.839
love doing that

3788.86 --> 3791.9590000000003
[Music]

3794.839 --> 3797.839
so

3798.16 --> 3802.0789999999997
right because everything everything a

3800.4 --> 3806.88
person does

3802.079 --> 3806.88
reveals them all your actions reveal you

3808.839 --> 3814.24
and it's only if you fool yourself to be

3812.96 --> 3819.119
anything else

3814.24 --> 3822.16
but what you are that you can get stuck

3819.119 --> 3823.039
like in a certain in a certain level and

3822.16 --> 3825.2
then other people

3823.039 --> 3827.5200000000004
will also go to that level and then

3825.2 --> 3831.52
you're on that level thinking and

3827.52 --> 3835.52
acting on that level but there is always

3831.52 --> 3835.52
an ability to kind of rise above it

3835.68 --> 3838.96
if you have the room for yourself if you

3838.4 --> 3841.599
don't

3838.96 --> 3843.119
literally get stuck and anchored in that

3841.599 --> 3847.44
level and can't get out

3843.119 --> 3847.44
and that's people get that sometimes

3847.68 --> 3854.3999999999996
it's like sort of an obsession effect

3851.68 --> 3856.64
savonia is have it a lot by the way

3854.4 --> 3858.4
safante is not just like oh just a

3856.64 --> 3859.92
couple of individuals cervonia is a

3858.4 --> 3862.0
cultural plague

3859.92 --> 3862.96
it's a natural result for a lot of

3862.0 --> 3867.52
people to

3862.96 --> 3869.68
to end up like that

3867.52 --> 3870.88
to get very obsessive and single

3869.68 --> 3874.5589999999997
singular-minded

3870.88 --> 3877.039
polarized it's natural in response to

3874.559 --> 3880.559
what this world has become

3877.039 --> 3883.3590000000004
and the way things work on social media

3880.559 --> 3883.3590000000004
and in the news

3892.839 --> 3895.839
right

3899.599 --> 3905.52
i think you may equate trolls with

3902.16 --> 3908.8799999999997
interested viewers sometimes yes

3905.52 --> 3912.4
in a way

3908.88 --> 3913.039
because there's this that it's an effect

3912.4 --> 3916.1600000000003
sometimes

3913.039 --> 3920.1600000000003
it's like some people

3916.16 --> 3922.3999999999996
might be seeing it being interested

3920.16 --> 3924.3999999999996
but they're like embarrassed about

3922.4 --> 3926.48
themselves because they don't really

3924.4 --> 3929.119
know how to compose themselves

3926.48 --> 3931.44
in the face of it so it's like they feel

3929.119 --> 3934.079
like they're being really watched and

3931.44 --> 3936.2400000000002
they feel the shame or some sin that's

3934.079 --> 3939.2000000000003
on their mind something

3936.24 --> 3941.2
and then they just kind of like try to

3939.2 --> 3942.24
hide it back and compress it by being a

3941.2 --> 3945.4399999999996
smart ass but

3942.24 --> 3947.7599999999998
it might have not even been meant as oh

3945.44 --> 3948.799
i hate you or something it's just that

3947.76 --> 3951.28
they don't know

3948.799 --> 3954.64
how to compose themselves so they just

3951.28 --> 3954.6400000000003
act like a smart ass

3954.88 --> 3959.76
to kind of distract from that they don't

3957.68 --> 3960.96
really know how to compose themselves in

3959.76 --> 3965.599
the face of it

3960.96 --> 3968.0
right and i think that i get some trolls

3965.599 --> 3971.039
are like that and even people here now

3968.0 --> 3973.119
regularly and chat some of them

3971.039 --> 3974.4
kind of started out like that but then

3973.119 --> 3976.6400000000003
they did

3974.4 --> 3978.2400000000002
figure out how to compose themselves in

3976.64 --> 3978.96
the face of it and then it's just like

3978.24 --> 3981.2
hey it's

3978.96 --> 3982.7200000000003
actually kind of like that it's

3981.2 --> 3986.16
interesting

3982.72 --> 3989.5989999999997
it gives a broader view of things

3986.16 --> 3992.5589999999997
gets me out of that overs out of the

3989.599 --> 4006.4
oversimplified methodology and all that

3992.559 --> 4008.559
right so it's funny how that works

4006.4 --> 4010.7200000000003
not sure what category that puts me in

4008.559 --> 4021.8390000000004
you know what category that puts you in

4010.72 --> 4021.839
tiny womble

4026.96 --> 4035.839
saving the world one day at a time

4039.119 --> 4049.839
saving the world or just helping it

4042.64 --> 4049.839
helping out

4053.44 --> 4060.2400000000002
because i don't know saving the world

4057.119 --> 4062.2400000000002
makes it kind of dramatic really if you

4060.24 --> 4064.72
get technical

4062.24 --> 4066.72
because it suggests like a certain act

4064.72 --> 4071.9199999999996
is just

4066.72 --> 4071.9199999999996
it's like ultimate doom or the opposite

4072.72 --> 4076.0789999999997
but yeah on a daily basis and just with

4075.68 --> 4078.64
your

4076.079 --> 4079.76
will with where you want to go and how

4078.64 --> 4082.319
you compose yourself

4079.76 --> 4083.3590000000004
you can contribute to just helping out

4082.319 --> 4085.92
the world

4083.359 --> 4089.119
you can help people you can help the

4085.92 --> 4092.319
good or you can fight against it

4089.119 --> 4092.319
and try to tear it down

4100.799 --> 4105.839
okay number five

4104.239 --> 4108.5599999999995
okay well if you're not a troll it's

4105.839 --> 4111.759
just that coming in the chat and

4108.56 --> 4114.080000000001
opening up with oh you saved the world

4111.759 --> 4115.199
that is typically what a troll does

4114.08 --> 4117.2789999999995
maybe

4115.199 --> 4119.04
again you just didn't really know how to

4117.279 --> 4122.64
compose yourself

4119.04 --> 4122.64
so you kind of open up with that

4125.52 --> 4129.4400000000005
hey but if you don't want to comment

4127.04 --> 4131.759
again that's fine with me

4129.44 --> 4133.839
you want to play all hurt i i basically

4131.759 --> 4135.6
just said no it's okay

4133.839 --> 4136.88
it's okay you don't have to worry about

4135.6 --> 4140.56
it

4136.88 --> 4143.839
it's like you may

4140.56 --> 4147.04
just act like a troll not be a troll

4143.839 --> 4148.88
so i don't it's yeah i'm not gonna fall

4147.04 --> 4152.56
for that one

4148.88 --> 4152.56
it's kind of trollish what you just said

4152.88 --> 4161.839
but anyway thank you for the two pound

4154.799 --> 4161.839
super chat donation anyway

4172.839 --> 4175.839
man

4176.159 --> 4180.3189999999995
you guys can probably hear that wind

4178.239 --> 4186.159
right

4180.319 --> 4186.159000000001
it's like it's like a pretty heavy gust

4186.319 --> 4189.839000000001
it's like but it's also constant it's

4188.319 --> 4192.96
just

4189.839 --> 4196.08
it just keeps pushing and pushing

4192.96 --> 4198.96
it's like an air migration more

4196.08 --> 4200.88
than it is just a bunch of wind it's

4198.96 --> 4204.8
just this constant

4200.88 --> 4204.8
heavy flow in one direction

4209.52 --> 4213.679
you had that wind last night tiny wumbo

4212.32 --> 4216.88
yeah well

4213.679 --> 4219.1990000000005
so did i it's just still continuing

4216.88 --> 4221.12
last night was much heavier though it

4219.199 --> 4224.48
was really violent

4221.12 --> 4226.239
sometimes again the chairs kept like

4224.48 --> 4231.678999999999
bouncing around on the balcony like a

4226.239 --> 4245.839999999999
pinball machine

4231.679 --> 4245.84
so it's pretty heavy

4261.12 --> 4273.84
where were you at by the way tiny wumbo

4264.719 --> 4273.84
was it in england

4279.12 --> 4287.84
ah i hate this snark

4282.88 --> 4287.84
yeah a lot of whitney rotterdam as well

4289.12 --> 4294.64
yeah it yeah such heavy storms and then

4292.239 --> 4300.239
i do keep you up

4294.64 --> 4302.8
well with me well i'm kind of up anyways

4300.239 --> 4304.639999999999
i'm up relatively late but eventually i

4302.8 --> 4305.84
did go to bed and it didn't really keep

4304.64 --> 4307.52
me up

4305.84 --> 4309.360000000001
because it doesn't really matter like

4307.52 --> 4311.679
how finally it get at some point i just

4309.36 --> 4313.92
need to sleep and i will just sleep and

4311.679 --> 4315.6
my hearing almost turns off

4313.92 --> 4317.84
[Music]

4315.6 --> 4317.84
so

4326.84 --> 4331.12
right

4328.8 --> 4343.84
all right england east coast okay thanks

4331.12 --> 4343.84
good to know

4345.13 --> 4349.4890000000005
[Music]

4354.84 --> 4357.84
hmm

4365.199 --> 4368.4
right anyway uh

4368.88 --> 4372.400000000001
still got 45 minutes left i'm pretty

4372.08 --> 4375.04
much

4372.4 --> 4376.719
open for subjects i think i shared

4375.04 --> 4380.08
everything that i

4376.719 --> 4385.84
i pretty much could it's been

4380.08 --> 4385.84
pretty good so far so

4395.28 --> 4399.759999999999
right well good point there gaining

4396.96 --> 4401.84
wisdom saving the world starts with

4399.76 --> 4404.56
you pointing your compass to good and

4401.84 --> 4408.2390000000005
knowing what that means

4404.56 --> 4410.64
can we pull up that word

4408.239 --> 4413.839999999999
seeing how important and often it is

4410.64 --> 4413.84
used you mean the word compass

4415.28 --> 4417.599999999999
right

4420.159 --> 4425.28
well you know in in one

4423.36 --> 4426.639999999999
in one way if i'm gonna bring up vision

4425.28 --> 4429.92
stuff or if

4426.64 --> 4429.92
number five brought it up

4430.88 --> 4436.88
the funny thing was is that this is

4434.4 --> 4439.12
this is weird stuff by the way this this

4436.88 --> 4441.12
is like even more mysterious to myself

4439.12 --> 4444.159
is that

4441.12 --> 4447.199
i have vision memories from pretty young

4444.159 --> 4450.4
to 12 and stuff

4447.199 --> 4453.759999999999
i don't know how that works but

4450.4 --> 4455.679
i was confronted with the concept of the

4453.76 --> 4460.08
path of christ in a very

4455.679 --> 4464.32
visceral way through my in my visions

4460.08 --> 4467.679
very young and it just like

4464.32 --> 4469.599999999999
i was afraid i didn't understand and i

4467.679 --> 4473.76
was overwhelmed

4469.6 --> 4475.76
by the presentation of it and it's like

4473.76 --> 4477.4400000000005
i wanted to try but i was just

4475.76 --> 4478.64
completely faltering and like my

4477.44 --> 4482.879999999999
conscience could not

4478.64 --> 4484.320000000001
uphold taking the responsibility that is

4482.88 --> 4486.8
required to do it

4484.32 --> 4488.5599999999995
but in a way like the path of christ

4486.8 --> 4490.400000000001
like

4488.56 --> 4492.320000000001
i don't know through my visions i was

4490.4 --> 4496.32
confronted about that

4492.32 --> 4499.44
when i was 12.

4496.32 --> 4501.12
like literally seeing that and like

4499.44 --> 4502.719
it being like the path of christ

4501.12 --> 4507.28
literally being

4502.719 --> 4507.28
presented like this weird kind of narrow

4508.84 --> 4513.84
portal

4510.56 --> 4517.120000000001
like but it was all metaphorical and

4513.84 --> 4520.159000000001
but very serious now

4517.12 --> 4522.48
that was a weird experience because

4520.159 --> 4522.48
that's

4523.52 --> 4527.040000000001
like i had those insights in a time

4526.159 --> 4528.96
where i want

4527.04 --> 4530.88
i did not even really know what

4528.96 --> 4534.0
christianity was

4530.88 --> 4536.96
i've never read the bible at that point

4534.0 --> 4537.52
or it might have been red yeah i might

4536.96 --> 4539.44
have

4537.52 --> 4540.8
i think my mother or something might

4539.44 --> 4542.639999999999
have read from it

4540.8 --> 4545.04
at a certain point of my grandmother or

4542.64 --> 4545.04
something

4545.12 --> 4551.679
a little so that i do

4548.239 --> 4554.239
did know the rough lines about it

4551.679 --> 4556.56
but yeah i didn't take it away all that

4554.239 --> 4559.678999999999
serious back then

4556.56 --> 4562.320000000001
but through my visions i had that like

4559.679 --> 4564.32
heavy confrontation it was like you have

4562.32 --> 4565.599999999999
to decide you have to decide you have to

4564.32 --> 4568.5599999999995
decide like

4565.6 --> 4569.1990000000005
being really pushy on your spirit in

4568.56 --> 4571.76
like you

4569.199 --> 4573.759999999999
have to decide now when you're

4571.76 --> 4576.88
absolutely not ready

4573.76 --> 4580.159000000001
to take that responsibility like

4576.88 --> 4581.28
in the moment and that was a lot of what

4580.159 --> 4584.799999999999
it was about

4581.28 --> 4588.4
so yeah hey the visions in ways are

4584.8 --> 4588.400000000001
have been very painful

4589.84 --> 4595.6
it's just that in my memory

4593.04 --> 4597.6
the pain of the moment it's already

4595.6 --> 4598.88
resolved it's like it's resolved in my

4597.6 --> 4601.92
entire being

4598.88 --> 4604.04
right but back then it wasn't so what

4601.92 --> 4606.32
stood out the most was just the

4604.04 --> 4608.48
visualizations like the side effects

4606.32 --> 4611.92
almost the exeterics

4608.48 --> 4613.04
of the esoteric experience how about

4611.92 --> 4615.12
that right

4613.04 --> 4616.32
getting distracted by the visuals by the

4615.12 --> 4618.719
portal

4616.32 --> 4623.84
and just like the overwhelming nature of

4618.719 --> 4623.84
it and the sensation and not

4623.92 --> 4629.84
even believing that i could do that

4627.76 --> 4631.6
and guess what i'm here now and i'm

4629.84 --> 4634.4800000000005
doing that

4631.6 --> 4637.04
back then i could have never imagined

4634.48 --> 4638.4
that that was possible i literally did

4637.04 --> 4642.0
not believe

4638.4 --> 4645.28
i could be here living

4642.0 --> 4649.679
and breathing and being what i am to i i

4645.28 --> 4652.08
did not believe it was possible

4649.679 --> 4653.679
in the physical world you understand i

4652.08 --> 4656.48
did not believe

4653.679 --> 4657.6
for a second it was possible because i

4656.48 --> 4664.32
thought i was

4657.6 --> 4668.0
pathetic and doomed

4664.32 --> 4668.0
like in ways

4668.4 --> 4672.159
and it just had some good things to

4670.64 --> 4674.4800000000005
distract me from that

4672.159 --> 4677.36
that's what it was like to me and now

4674.48 --> 4679.839999999999
it's all different

4677.36 --> 4681.44
and i'm still stuck in sort of a weird

4679.84 --> 4685.66
little conundrum

4681.44 --> 4687.28
similar to back then but i am here now

4685.66 --> 4692.159
[Music]

4687.28 --> 4694.159
walking that path in my own vision that

4692.159 --> 4696.0
i could not imagine back then

4694.159 --> 4697.92
and it's pretty astounding to realize

4696.0 --> 4701.12
that

4697.92 --> 4702.88
and to reflect on that and also just

4701.12 --> 4706.5599999999995
like what the hell

4702.88 --> 4709.84
that i experienced that that i was being

4706.56 --> 4711.679
things pushed in my face or rather in my

4709.84 --> 4715.12
spirit

4711.679 --> 4716.2390000000005
that i could not imagine that it was

4715.12 --> 4720.08
true like i could not

4716.239 --> 4724.4
accept that that was possible almost

4720.08 --> 4728.0
yet it's here i am that

4724.4 --> 4731.599999999999
i'm doing that it's become critically

4728.0 --> 4735.199
cornerstone important to me

4731.6 --> 4737.04
and i and i wanted that in a way

4735.199 --> 4739.919999999999
i just could not believe it to be

4737.04 --> 4743.5199999999995
possible i could not believe it

4739.92 --> 4743.52
i thought i really was doomed

4744.239 --> 4752.32
but now it's different and that doom

4748.4 --> 4756.08
in a way is still also there

4752.32 --> 4759.679
but it's like it

4756.08 --> 4762.8
it's fading or rather like it doesn't

4759.679 --> 4763.6
matter anymore it's like the doom is

4762.8 --> 4766.08
like yeah yeah

4763.6 --> 4768.96
yeah yeah i know it ends up in doom but

4766.08 --> 4771.6
it doesn't matter anymore

4768.96 --> 4771.6
not really

4774.159 --> 4778.239
the only thing that really matters is

4776.48 --> 4780.639999999999
that i'm doing my best

4778.239 --> 4782.48
and then trying to get better and i am

4780.64 --> 4783.84
getting better and i still have a lot of

4782.48 --> 4786.4
good things

4783.84 --> 4786.400000000001
for me

4788.84 --> 4792.96
and

4790.48 --> 4794.32
even still figuring out my place in the

4792.96 --> 4797.6
world but i already have

4794.32 --> 4801.04
something at least have some kind of

4797.6 --> 4803.120000000001
long-term outlook like i can imagine

4801.04 --> 4805.28
myself throughout the future whether for

4803.12 --> 4806.32
good or bad i can at least imagine

4805.28 --> 4810.0
myself there

4806.32 --> 4811.759999999999
now that's a huge huge difference from

4810.0 --> 4814.719
20 years ago

4811.76 --> 4816.0
i could not put myself in that future

4814.719 --> 4817.84
view i couldn't

4816.0 --> 4819.04
i just couldn't do it i didn't know how

4817.84 --> 4821.92
i didn't know what to

4819.04 --> 4824.4
to look at now i can't imagine myself in

4821.92 --> 4824.4
the future

4827.199 --> 4831.759999999999
and it's like i'm rather spending my

4829.92 --> 4833.84
time trying to figure out how to get

4831.76 --> 4833.84
there

4836.96 --> 4840.719
but through actions and not through

4843.68 --> 4846.56
[Music]

4844.84 --> 4848.8
waiting

4846.56 --> 4861.84
hello by the way jason mccormack yeah

4848.8 --> 4861.84
all is well i'm doing great

4894.8 --> 4898.320000000001
right also weird by the way that

4896.8 --> 4900.84
experience

4898.32 --> 4902.48
of being the path of christ seeing it

4900.84 --> 4904.8
metaphorically

4902.48 --> 4906.718999999999
in the vision but already like in the

4904.8 --> 4908.88
subvision

4906.719 --> 4910.4
a separate moment this is not all part

4908.88 --> 4916.4800000000005
of the 2017

4910.4 --> 4920.08
uh 1997 experience

4916.48 --> 4921.04
was that seeing and knowing about the

4920.08 --> 4925.199
path

4921.04 --> 4927.679
like i had like an unexpected

4925.199 --> 4930.32
exoteric response to it too it's like i

4927.679 --> 4933.52
was being presented with something

4930.32 --> 4935.36
and i couldn't accept it i couldn't i'd

4933.52 --> 4937.4400000000005
figure out how to do it you know why

4935.36 --> 4938.48
because i was overwhelmed by sensation

4937.44 --> 4941.5199999999995
like this is not

4938.48 --> 4943.919999999999
fair like

4941.52 --> 4944.96
how can things have been designed to

4943.92 --> 4948.4
work this way i

4944.96 --> 4950.32
i didn't understand and i thought it was

4948.4 --> 4955.28
unacceptable i thought i was being

4950.32 --> 4955.28
fooled in a way

4955.92 --> 4961.84
in a way

4959.52 --> 4962.88
like that somebody that there was a

4961.84 --> 4965.12
force out there

4962.88 --> 4967.52
trying to convince me that things were

4965.12 --> 4971.04
very specific

4967.52 --> 4971.040000000001
and not so free

4971.28 --> 4976.4
like how things work what what is good

4973.76 --> 4976.400000000001
what is bad

4976.48 --> 4982.959999999999
but i i could not accept i was

4980.0 --> 4984.239
like that way like liberal resistance in

4982.96 --> 4986.159
that but from a good

4984.239 --> 4989.839999999999
like i really wanted to do good i

4986.159 --> 4989.839999999999
thought it's just like unfair it's like

4992.719 --> 5000.2390000000005
like isn't everything basically designed

4996.56 --> 5004.0
to be then how come we have

5000.239 --> 5006.32
these yeah why must we have this fate of

5004.0 --> 5006.8
being constantly seduced by the darkness

5006.32 --> 5008.4
and why

5006.8 --> 5010.08
does it even have to come from the

5008.4 --> 5012.719
inside

5010.08 --> 5014.4
and all that it's like i had trouble

5012.719 --> 5019.199
accepting like

5014.4 --> 5021.36
creation like accepting logos it's not

5019.199 --> 5022.5599999999995
even like not recognizing it's not real

5021.36 --> 5026.08
it's just like

5022.56 --> 5028.400000000001
this is unacceptable it's like this is

5026.08 --> 5029.6
unfair law that's basically what i

5028.4 --> 5032.239
thought

5029.6 --> 5034.400000000001
in my own way and did not realize oh

5032.239 --> 5035.919999999999
that's defining god or no it's just like

5034.4 --> 5037.839999999999
an honest response like i didn't think

5035.92 --> 5042.719
it was fair

5037.84 --> 5045.76
but now much later in life having gone

5042.719 --> 5048.719
through a lot more

5045.76 --> 5049.679
facing more and more other people i

5048.719 --> 5053.12
realize now

5049.679 --> 5056.96
why it is like that and that there

5053.12 --> 5060.8
is more purpose and structure

5056.96 --> 5064.96
and balance to it all then i could

5060.8 --> 5067.1990000000005
understand back then

5064.96 --> 5068.8
i just understand more why it is the way

5067.199 --> 5070.96
it is

5068.8 --> 5072.4800000000005
and that there is just this thing about

5070.96 --> 5075.6
challenge

5072.48 --> 5078.0
like it the design was built in a way

5075.6 --> 5081.04
that there has to be a challenge

5078.0 --> 5082.4
a challenge will make itself one way or

5081.04 --> 5084.239
the other

5082.4 --> 5085.839999999999
either through some something in

5084.239 --> 5090.879999999999
opposition

5085.84 --> 5090.88
or through peace from within yourself

5091.52 --> 5095.84
and that's kind of part of the spirit

5093.679 --> 5099.4400000000005
the spiritual dynamics

5095.84 --> 5101.12
within creation and back then

5099.44 --> 5103.5199999999995
i thought it wasn't acceptable i felt

5101.12 --> 5105.92
like but why are we designed to be

5103.52 --> 5113.4400000000005
haunted basically

5105.92 --> 5117.28
to be hunted down for our weaknesses

5113.44 --> 5117.28
right so i guess a lot of

5118.4 --> 5124.638999999999
philosophical inner turmoil conflict and

5121.199 --> 5128.5599999999995
that was like when i was freaking 12

5124.639 --> 5130.8
and that age and before that too

5128.56 --> 5132.8
like even after eight i was already

5130.8 --> 5134.4800000000005
struggling with this i was already

5132.8 --> 5137.04
struggling with this [ __ ]

5134.48 --> 5138.718999999999
when i wasn't even 10 yet but it was

5137.04 --> 5141.84
completely inside me

5138.719 --> 5143.28
it's just like gazing at the world like

5141.84 --> 5146.8
why is it like this why is like

5143.28 --> 5146.8
why are they acting like that why

5150.159 --> 5154.4
but yeah i guess that going through the

5153.52 --> 5157.360000000001
process

5154.4 --> 5157.36
for a long time

5158.719 --> 5162.639
i'm just surrendering i'm surrendering

5160.88 --> 5166.08
to the design

5162.639 --> 5171.12
of reality itself

5166.08 --> 5171.12
not the design made for us by man

5171.199 --> 5174.0
that's the difference

5176.239 --> 5182.879999999999
i'm surrendering to just the design

5179.6 --> 5185.52
of creation of god the

5182.88 --> 5186.2390000000005
of just realizing how things are what it

5185.52 --> 5191.76
really is

5186.239 --> 5191.759999999999
what it means and the complicated

5194.96 --> 5201.199
strands that interconnect everything

5198.239 --> 5201.839999999999
and not just an oversimplified little

5201.199 --> 5205.5199999999995
mental

5201.84 --> 5209.28
program a mind game program

5205.52 --> 5211.84
that mankind is presenting for people to

5209.28 --> 5211.84
follow

5212.159 --> 5216.4
which puts people that follow it in a

5214.4 --> 5220.32
more superficial state

5216.4 --> 5220.32
it's more like a child like game

5220.48 --> 5227.759999999999
and it prevents them from wisening up

5225.28 --> 5231.36
and gaining more senses in order to

5227.76 --> 5231.360000000001
figure out what the world really is

5233.92 --> 5236.4800000000005
but yeah i've

5236.96 --> 5240.719
i've always liked playing mind games

5239.44 --> 5244.08
like that

5240.719 --> 5246.56
but never really latching on to that

5244.08 --> 5247.28
because every yeah when i did i would

5246.56 --> 5249.52
quickly

5247.28 --> 5250.5599999999995
end up figuring it out like i can't fool

5249.52 --> 5253.6
myself

5250.56 --> 5255.76
like that eventually eventually i

5253.6 --> 5257.120000000001
figured out because i want to be honest

5255.76 --> 5260.4800000000005
because

5257.12 --> 5262.5599999999995
i will not accept lies

5260.48 --> 5264.5599999999995
and then if you don't accept lies then

5262.56 --> 5265.120000000001
you can't effectively keep fooling

5264.56 --> 5268.8
yourself

5265.12 --> 5272.5599999999995
to beliefs man-made stories

5268.8 --> 5276.719
man-made programs of reality instead of

5272.56 --> 5281.84
just the natural raw sensory input

5276.719 --> 5281.84
of reality

5293.28 --> 5296.8
okay tiny one more

5303.92 --> 5307.28
you don't believe creation anymore well

5305.84 --> 5310.32
that's your problem then you haven't

5307.28 --> 5310.32
really paid attention

5314.0 --> 5325.12
i'm not gonna debate you about that

5323.199 --> 5327.36
i don't believe in creation because i

5325.12 --> 5329.599999999999
was told about it

5327.36 --> 5330.96
i believe it because there is no other

5329.6 --> 5337.84
possible way for

5330.96 --> 5337.84
existence to be

5348.84 --> 5351.84
uh

5355.92 --> 5365.84
all right

5375.09 --> 5379.84
[Music]

5376.84 --> 5379.84
anyway

5399.84 --> 5407.84
yeah hold on i'll be back two minutes

5446.84 --> 5449.84
so

5460.84 --> 5463.84
so

5502.84 --> 5505.84
um

5510.719 --> 5518.0
what all right tiny wumbo creation

5513.76 --> 5521.4400000000005
story you say well

5518.0 --> 5523.36
creation story or maybe creation is not

5521.44 --> 5526.4
about a creation story

5523.36 --> 5529.36
as in an origin story right

5526.4 --> 5529.759999999999
yeah there is interesting things about

5529.36 --> 5534.239
the

5529.76 --> 5537.719
biblical origin story adam and eve

5534.239 --> 5539.12
but yeah if people say oh that is

5537.719 --> 5542.4
absolutely

5539.12 --> 5544.4
literal in every sense

5542.4 --> 5545.839999999999
and it's like nothing is fabricated

5544.4 --> 5548.5599999999995
about it at all yeah i

5545.84 --> 5549.1990000000005
of course understand if you have doubts

5548.56 --> 5551.280000000001
at that

5549.199 --> 5553.678999999999
in a way so do i i don't even take

5551.28 --> 5557.44
things literal anymore like that

5553.679 --> 5561.28
i'm a pure as a terrorist because

5557.44 --> 5564.5599999999995
yeah in a way everything seems fake

5561.28 --> 5567.36
and nothing seems fake it's just

5564.56 --> 5568.639
yeah getting kind of weird like that but

5567.36 --> 5571.839999999999
creation

5568.639 --> 5573.1990000000005
is not about the origin story creation

5571.84 --> 5576.2390000000005
is about the very

5573.199 --> 5579.678999999999
fabric of reality on

5576.239 --> 5582.879999999999
every conceivable level

5579.679 --> 5586.0
it's about not a story it's about

5582.88 --> 5589.6
figuring things out and then just

5586.0 --> 5593.84
it unfolds the message unfolds

5589.6 --> 5596.88
this can only ever have been designed

5593.84 --> 5600.400000000001
this cannot create itself

5596.88 --> 5602.56
everything about physical reality

5600.4 --> 5606.0
eventually reveals that has nothing to

5602.56 --> 5606.0
do with some origin story

5609.92 --> 5614.2390000000005
god the designer this yeah even to say

5613.36 --> 5617.92
god is just

5614.239 --> 5621.678999999999
the designer reveals itself

5617.92 --> 5625.04
in everything absolutely

5621.679 --> 5631.84
everything even within

5625.04 --> 5631.84
the essence of our very spirit

5637.52 --> 5645.120000000001
so yeah because every story in a book

5641.52 --> 5648.080000000001
has issues

5645.12 --> 5648.48
that was my offset too it's like oh i

5648.08 --> 5650.08
really

5648.48 --> 5651.839999999999
like when i first was confronted with

5650.08 --> 5655.44
the bible i thought this is a really

5651.84 --> 5657.360000000001
awesome story it's fascinating and i

5655.44 --> 5659.199
love the part with jesus and like

5657.36 --> 5660.88
being the good thing the diplomatic

5659.199 --> 5664.239
thing but just like

5660.88 --> 5665.92
raising up that essence i felt it i had

5664.239 --> 5667.599999999999
the census to take that

5665.92 --> 5670.4
i thought it was awesome but then when i

5667.6 --> 5672.639
realized that there's people out there

5670.4 --> 5674.5599999999995
that were not reflecting the essence of

5672.639 --> 5675.84
jesus at all and they were basically

5674.56 --> 5678.96
just

5675.84 --> 5679.6
social power grabbing and [ __ ] and using

5678.96 --> 5682.2390000000005
it

5679.6 --> 5683.119000000001
the details of bible to make people feel

5682.239 --> 5686.4
bad

5683.119 --> 5689.199
that's when i thought i'm a synthesis

5686.4 --> 5690.4
i'm a satanist because i'm anti-that i

5689.199 --> 5692.5599999999995
don't like that

5690.4 --> 5693.92
but i didn't realize what that actually

5692.56 --> 5695.6
meant i didn't realize

5693.92 --> 5697.52
like oh wait there's a whole bunch of

5695.6 --> 5699.679
people out there that are complete

5697.52 --> 5702.4800000000005
[ __ ] maniacs

5699.679 --> 5702.96
and that are thousand times worse than

5702.48 --> 5706.159
like

5702.96 --> 5708.719
bible bashers people that bash people

5706.159 --> 5711.04
over the head with the bible

5708.719 --> 5713.44
i didn't know that back then i was naive

5711.04 --> 5713.44
to that

5713.679 --> 5721.119
right and that's now how i've basically

5717.28 --> 5721.119
after a long weird

5721.76 --> 5728.400000000001
phase i'm now walking a path of christ

5725.92 --> 5733.1990000000005
in my own view in a very esoteric

5728.4 --> 5736.239
way in a path of christ

5733.199 --> 5738.4
but also yeah i

5736.239 --> 5741.04
i've come to respect more and more

5738.4 --> 5741.04
paganism

5741.52 --> 5744.88
it's just that what is pagan and what is

5744.48 --> 5747.839999999999
just

5744.88 --> 5749.1990000000005
gay you see i love to say it like that

5747.84 --> 5752.400000000001
it's just like

5749.199 --> 5753.36
everything people do has elements of

5752.4 --> 5756.08
something

5753.36 --> 5757.04
and then they have other things on top

5756.08 --> 5760.48
of that

5757.04 --> 5764.4
and then yay if you don't like the one

5760.48 --> 5767.678999999999
you can just say oh that means that

5764.4 --> 5768.159
that all is that other element that more

5767.679 --> 5772.0
people

5768.159 --> 5774.638999999999
are likely to dislike right

5772.0 --> 5776.56
it's because it's everybody's a mixed

5774.639 --> 5781.28
package

5776.56 --> 5784.400000000001
but a lot of pagan things i really like

5781.28 --> 5786.159
if you just take the darkness and doom

5784.4 --> 5787.599999999999
out of it because that's also just a

5786.159 --> 5789.839999999999
tainting

5787.6 --> 5791.92
force a tainting a suggestion that's

5789.84 --> 5794.8
been put on there by satanist

5791.92 --> 5795.76
it's like make everything ugly doomed

5794.8 --> 5799.360000000001
evil

5795.76 --> 5801.119000000001
secretly disgusting like everything just

5799.36 --> 5802.639
as it is it's like always been it's

5801.119 --> 5804.48
always been beautiful just what it is

5802.639 --> 5806.8
and then suddenly somebody makes stories

5804.48 --> 5809.599999999999
and suddenly now it's like secretly this

5806.8 --> 5809.6
ugly [ __ ]

5810.84 --> 5813.84
right

5814.08 --> 5817.44
and that's why i said taking it back

5816.96 --> 5821.04
like

5817.44 --> 5821.04
33 i'm taking it back

5821.44 --> 5825.44
and even the idea of the cremation of

5824.0 --> 5828.4
care which i think also

5825.44 --> 5829.919999999999
is arrived derived from paganism it's

5828.4 --> 5832.96
basically just

5829.92 --> 5834.96
burning a fire thinking about what

5832.96 --> 5837.76
worries you

5834.96 --> 5840.96
and then using that moment to kind of

5837.76 --> 5843.52
actively let go certain things

5840.96 --> 5846.0
that you that are punishing you but you

5843.52 --> 5848.080000000001
can't really do anything about it

5846.0 --> 5849.36
right that's what i think the original

5848.08 --> 5852.639
cremation of care

5849.36 --> 5855.839999999999
is and i'm taking it back

5852.639 --> 5856.8
i'm saying no yeah satanist might do

5855.84 --> 5859.76
that

5856.8 --> 5861.119000000001
it's not bears although they think

5859.76 --> 5863.76
everything is theirs

5861.119 --> 5865.04
right it's not theirs it was just

5863.76 --> 5867.360000000001
everyone's

5865.04 --> 5869.28
it's like a thing you can do it's a

5867.36 --> 5872.96
little trick a little ritual

5869.28 --> 5877.36
that doesn't have to be evil

5872.96 --> 5883.84
it's just a way to deal with things

5877.36 --> 5883.839999999999
in your life right

5898.639 --> 5910.4800000000005
yeah but evolution is not even a theory

5903.04 --> 5914.56
it's a rough clade together concept

5910.48 --> 5919.04
it's very vague it's just a suggestion

5914.56 --> 5921.1990000000005
with very rough evidences that when

5919.04 --> 5922.639
looked into further are not really

5921.199 --> 5924.719
evidences at all

5922.639 --> 5926.0
that's what evolution is it's just a

5924.719 --> 5931.04
very rough drawn

5926.0 --> 5931.04
concept that is very easy to disprove

5935.119 --> 5938.159
like by the fundamental fire is funny

5937.52 --> 5941.6
how to say

5938.159 --> 5953.28
by the fundamental design it is very

5941.6 --> 5957.52
easy to disprove

5953.28 --> 5960.48
yeah the suggestion that mutation

5957.52 --> 5961.52
which is like natural deviation can lead

5960.48 --> 5964.638999999999
to evil

5961.52 --> 5966.96
like an evolved better species

5964.639 --> 5969.119
is already contradicting just the very

5966.96 --> 5972.08
nature of design itself it's like

5969.119 --> 5974.239
no the design has an optimum it's like a

5972.08 --> 5977.5199999999995
central point where it is perfect

5974.239 --> 5980.159
the more it deviates from it the less

5977.52 --> 5982.8
cohesive the less functional it becomes

5980.159 --> 5984.239
so a mutation is technically always

5982.8 --> 5987.119000000001
stepping away

5984.239 --> 5988.638999999999
from the core essence the core blueprint

5987.119 --> 5992.88
the core design

5988.639 --> 5995.52
and it is just proven that the more

5992.88 --> 5997.52
a genetic blueprint deviates from the

5995.52 --> 5999.679
original design

5997.52 --> 6001.52
the less efficient it becomes and

5999.679 --> 6004.88
eventually even dies out

6001.52 --> 6008.2390000000005
it like becomes unable to procreate

6004.88 --> 6009.84
or gets erratic and aggressive these are

6008.239 --> 6012.959999999999
all the yeah

6009.84 --> 6016.159000000001
no procreation aggression

6012.96 --> 6019.679
erratic behavior those are

6016.159 --> 6023.92
the three core results

6019.679 --> 6026.96
the three the three voices of doom

6023.92 --> 6029.6
for every mutation

6026.96 --> 6030.56
from the original and that just

6029.6 --> 6034.320000000001
disproves

6030.56 --> 6038.320000000001
evolution as a functionary system

6034.32 --> 6041.679
it just can't be it's just impossible

6038.32 --> 6043.119
it's not viable doesn't make any

6041.679 --> 6045.119
freaking sense it leads to

6043.119 --> 6048.5599999999995
self-destruction not

6045.119 --> 6051.839999999999
long-lasting life cycles

6048.56 --> 6051.84
you see

6054.24 --> 6057.42
[Music]

6060.159 --> 6065.839999999999
gradient can you question what

6084.32 --> 6087.639
right well transmutation gaining wisdom

6086.56 --> 6090.719
like

6087.639 --> 6093.04
transmutation is spirit is energy

6090.719 --> 6095.04
is has to do as involvement with

6093.04 --> 6095.679
consciousness it's not the same thing as

6095.04 --> 6099.84
like

6095.679 --> 6103.52
the genetic blueprint mutation

6099.84 --> 6106.56
in a physical sense is not viable

6103.52 --> 6107.76
transmutation in a spiritual sense is is

6106.56 --> 6110.8
essential

6107.76 --> 6111.4400000000005
so in a way i sometimes think that this

6110.8 --> 6114.96
spirit

6111.44 --> 6117.919999999999
actually does evolve like evolution

6114.96 --> 6119.28
is actually the structure of that is

6117.92 --> 6122.08
about the spirit

6119.28 --> 6122.88
and not the physical physical is

6122.08 --> 6134.32
designed

6122.88 --> 6137.92
the spirit evolves

6134.32 --> 6141.28
like it alters and it does it every time

6137.92 --> 6143.6
within a life cycle and it's like yeah

6141.28 --> 6144.8
there's even like unique traits that

6143.6 --> 6148.400000000001
unfold

6144.8 --> 6150.08
specifically because of yeah

6148.4 --> 6153.04
the process it's like an evolution a

6150.08 --> 6153.04
growth process

6155.44 --> 6163.04
it's like every day your consciousness

6159.04 --> 6163.84
wakes anew like is reborn every day your

6163.04 --> 6167.119
consciousness

6163.84 --> 6170.56
is reborn it is reformed

6167.119 --> 6173.04
from everything that you were

6170.56 --> 6173.92
including everything that's come entered

6173.04 --> 6176.719
new

6173.92 --> 6177.6
in the early stages and so you're reborn

6176.719 --> 6180.719
it's like

6177.6 --> 6183.76
the new generation

6180.719 --> 6186.719
the new cycle of the conscious it's a

6183.76 --> 6187.84
much shorter cycle than the biological

6186.719 --> 6191.52
systems

6187.84 --> 6193.76
right only procreates

6191.52 --> 6195.76
like every yeah every generation which

6193.76 --> 6197.76
is like what is it a 10-year cycle or

6195.76 --> 6200.08
something roughly like that

6197.76 --> 6201.119000000001
on average well the mind and the

6200.08 --> 6204.239
consciousness

6201.119 --> 6207.759999999999
is evolving is

6204.239 --> 6210.638999999999
putting on a new generation every day

6207.76 --> 6212.320000000001
every time it wakes up it's like an

6210.639 --> 6214.719
evolution

6212.32 --> 6215.5199999999995
it's not but it's it's the same thing it

6214.719 --> 6219.84
evolves

6215.52 --> 6219.84
the consciousness itself evolves

6222.08 --> 6225.92
and that's how i see it and i think also

6224.08 --> 6229.84
that even the idea

6225.92 --> 6233.4400000000005
of biological evolution

6229.84 --> 6235.360000000001
was originally derived from the mental

6233.44 --> 6236.638999999999
evolution process they basically took

6235.36 --> 6239.839999999999
the mental

6236.639 --> 6243.4400000000005
evolution spiritual evolution

6239.84 --> 6246.96
and then transposed that onto

6243.44 --> 6248.879999999999
physical evolution and reified that

6246.96 --> 6250.08
i think that's how they came to that

6248.88 --> 6254.719
they just lent

6250.08 --> 6258.639
it from the spirit mechanisms and then

6254.719 --> 6262.08
transposed that onto physical

6258.639 --> 6263.1990000000005
physical design and to try to take away

6262.08 --> 6266.48
the design of it

6263.199 --> 6266.48
making itself forming

6272.84 --> 6277.76
right

6275.6 --> 6279.320000000001
because maybe the spirit in a way is

6277.76 --> 6281.6
like self-forming like that

6279.32 --> 6284.159
self-reforming

6281.6 --> 6286.08
it's it's very odd to say like oh is the

6284.159 --> 6287.679
spirit the primary or is it the

6286.08 --> 6288.88
secondary is it the side effect of the

6287.679 --> 6290.88
body

6288.88 --> 6292.719
well a lot of people including myself

6290.88 --> 6295.28
believe that free spirit is actually

6292.719 --> 6295.28
primary

6301.44 --> 6307.04
but spirit also changes

6304.88 --> 6307.92
in in response to the world in response

6307.04 --> 6310.96
to information

6307.92 --> 6312.4
gain in response to physical situations

6310.96 --> 6315.76
altering

6312.4 --> 6316.638999999999
hormones and everything depending on the

6315.76 --> 6319.280000000001
receptacle

6316.639 --> 6319.28
our bodies

6325.04 --> 6330.96
so yeah i think that the spirit

6328.4 --> 6333.44
and the mind but especially the spirit

6330.96 --> 6336.8
it evolves

6333.44 --> 6339.04
within its lifetime and maybe even

6336.8 --> 6342.400000000001
generation upon generation there is a

6339.04 --> 6345.92
continuous development cycle of spirits

6342.4 --> 6347.5199999999995
happening like through the generations

6345.92 --> 6350.719
and the information is passed on and

6347.52 --> 6354.400000000001
that even can potentially help

6350.719 --> 6356.4800000000005
help the evolution process of of

6354.4 --> 6358.4
a certain generation spirit of certain

6356.48 --> 6359.599999999999
individuals within there not everybody

6358.4 --> 6361.759999999999
always takes it there's always going to

6359.6 --> 6364.88
be rebels that are going to step away

6361.76 --> 6369.04
always but

6364.88 --> 6372.4800000000005
when it comes to physical development

6369.04 --> 6374.0
genetics procreation all that

6372.48 --> 6375.839999999999
that's where evolution is just

6374.0 --> 6380.32
completely

6375.84 --> 6380.32
just no everything contradicts that

6384.0 --> 6387.679
why does god allow the controllers to

6385.92 --> 6391.04
have so much power over us i think

6387.679 --> 6394.2390000000005
you're asking the wrong question

6391.04 --> 6398.08
i think the right question should be

6394.239 --> 6401.599999999999
why does god

6398.08 --> 6404.48
allow the people to

6401.6 --> 6405.04
yeah to give the controller so much

6404.48 --> 6414.4
power

6405.04 --> 6416.0
over them how about that question

6414.4 --> 6417.5199999999995
it's still a good question from your

6416.0 --> 6421.28
side though

6417.52 --> 6421.280000000001
i just upped the ante there

6421.36 --> 6429.839999999999
hope you can appreciate that

6440.4 --> 6443.839999999999
because it's eventually always going to

6442.719 --> 6447.36
be the people that

6443.84 --> 6449.6
allow others to have control over them

6447.36 --> 6452.239
for whatever justified reason

6449.6 --> 6454.4800000000005
you know whether it's necessary or they

6452.239 --> 6457.5199999999995
can't do it themselves

6454.48 --> 6460.5599999999995
or the others just so great

6457.52 --> 6460.96
they'll do a better job it's the people

6460.56 --> 6464.159000000001
that

6460.96 --> 6471.84
allow it to transpire

6464.159 --> 6471.839999999999
it's always always that

6487.199 --> 6499.839999999999
right george sanford yeah that was my

6488.88 --> 6499.84
question too

6509.679 --> 6513.52
important got in a weaker satanic entity

6512.0 --> 6516.56
is the christian model

6513.52 --> 6517.4400000000005
which is not necessary is not might not

6516.56 --> 6520.56
necessarily

6517.44 --> 6520.5599999999995
well look

6521.6 --> 6527.119000000001
it's all about the ability for a person

6525.44 --> 6529.678999999999
to associate

6527.119 --> 6531.28
and i think that yeah this might sound

6529.679 --> 6533.92
weird to people like

6531.28 --> 6535.44
i believe in all encompassing god and

6533.92 --> 6538.96
that includes evil

6535.44 --> 6541.919999999999
it's just that why why would it right

6538.96 --> 6543.36
that's where the individual like this

6541.92 --> 6546.639
the consciousness

6543.36 --> 6550.32
with itself conflict arises like why why

6546.639 --> 6552.8
why why evil why right that's our

6550.32 --> 6552.799999999999
problem

6553.199 --> 6558.879999999999
it's our personal problem

6556.4 --> 6559.839999999999
and because so many people can't deal

6558.88 --> 6563.28
with that

6559.84 --> 6565.52
they then compartmentalize god

6563.28 --> 6566.8
into good and evil so they can always

6565.52 --> 6570.159000000001
love good

6566.8 --> 6573.84
and always hate evil

6570.159 --> 6573.839999999999
not realizing that it's basically

6574.08 --> 6577.84
yeah two players in the same game and

6577.199 --> 6580.799999999999
they are

6577.84 --> 6581.119000000001
always interlinked so why could it not

6580.8 --> 6583.360000000001
be

6581.119 --> 6584.639
a left hand and a right hand of the same

6583.36 --> 6586.719
body

6584.639 --> 6588.159000000001
it's just that we just don't understand

6586.719 --> 6590.639
that doesn't mean that

6588.159 --> 6591.679
evil should be getting away with being

6590.639 --> 6593.52
evil

6591.679 --> 6595.84
because we don't understand and they

6593.52 --> 6597.92
would love to tell us you but you just

6595.84 --> 6600.400000000001
don't understand

6597.92 --> 6601.84
we are necessary we're the necessary

6600.4 --> 6604.5599999999995
evil right

6601.84 --> 6606.400000000001
yeah that is their excuse from their

6604.56 --> 6607.119000000001
evil perspective because evil is still

6606.4 --> 6611.199
evil

6607.119 --> 6613.199
and evil will always abuse situation

6611.199 --> 6614.719
right so just because evil is evil

6613.199 --> 6617.5199999999995
doesn't mean that

6614.719 --> 6619.679
they are necessary because that's

6617.52 --> 6622.159000000001
convenient to them it's just that

6619.679 --> 6623.1990000000005
evil always happens that's the necessary

6622.159 --> 6626.159
part it's not

6623.199 --> 6630.159
that a evil is necessary to be there

6626.159 --> 6630.159
it's just that it always happens

6632.159 --> 6640.239
and yeah people

6635.599 --> 6643.119000000001
have a lot of trouble dealing with that

6640.239 --> 6644.799999999999
dealing with the reality of always evil

6643.119 --> 6649.92
always arriving always be there

6644.8 --> 6652.159000000001
people you thought were great corrupting

6649.92 --> 6653.76
not everybody but some and it will ruin

6652.159 --> 6654.239
things and then it will set the new

6653.76 --> 6656.88
setting

6654.239 --> 6657.839999999999
and then the new players arrive to take

6656.88 --> 6662.08
control

6657.84 --> 6667.84
and it just happens every freaking time

6662.08 --> 6667.84
every generation

6671.44 --> 6675.44
and right yeah then if you all unify the

6674.4 --> 6678.879999999999
creator under

6675.44 --> 6679.678999999999
one entity or one consciousness which it

6678.88 --> 6682.719
should be

6679.679 --> 6683.04
because that's the that has to work like

6682.719 --> 6686.719
that

6683.04 --> 6690.239
design wise then she's like yeah

6686.719 --> 6692.4800000000005
all that [ __ ] you want to love

6690.239 --> 6694.0
critter creator but there's also all

6692.48 --> 6696.4
that [ __ ] so what do you do

6694.0 --> 6697.44
with that then do you like wherever and

6696.4 --> 6699.598999999999
all that [ __ ]

6697.44 --> 6701.839999999999
but you see it's it just becomes too

6699.599 --> 6702.400000000001
complicated so people compartmental i

6701.84 --> 6705.679
say no

6702.4 --> 6707.759999999999
no no god is only good it's only

6705.679 --> 6709.84
everything that's pure and beautiful on

6707.76 --> 6714.08
that one side of the spectrum

6709.84 --> 6714.08
and on the other side is the opposer

6714.32 --> 6718.96
and we have to get rid of that from the

6715.92 --> 6721.28
good perspective not realizing that it's

6718.96 --> 6722.719
a spectrum the entire thing is a

6721.28 --> 6725.04
spectrum

6722.719 --> 6728.08
without the evil you would not even

6725.04 --> 6728.08
recognize the good

6730.08 --> 6736.639
it's just becomes extremely complicated

6733.44 --> 6739.919999999999
to the consciousness

6736.639 --> 6742.400000000001
to an individual sensation

6739.92 --> 6745.84
to be able to accept it and that's why

6742.4 --> 6745.839999999999
people have split it up

6746.56 --> 6754.0
and that's kind of how i'm looking at it

6750.48 --> 6757.36
and to me god is good

6754.0 --> 6760.239
because it just is

6757.36 --> 6762.5599999999995
it's just that evil it has a role to

6760.239 --> 6762.5599999999995
play

6763.119 --> 6766.159
it's there for a reason it's part of the

6765.199 --> 6769.598999999999
design it

6766.159 --> 6772.799999999999
had to be you see it had to

6769.599 --> 6776.0
be that doesn't mean that

6772.8 --> 6779.4400000000005
should be happy about it that's

6776.0 --> 6780.639
not the reason it had to be because it

6779.44 --> 6783.678999999999
had to be because

6780.639 --> 6784.639
it's part of a process that we from our

6783.679 --> 6786.56
consciousness

6784.639 --> 6788.400000000001
individual perspective don't have full

6786.56 --> 6792.080000000001
oversight over we just have to go

6788.4 --> 6794.48
through all the cycles and be part of

6792.08 --> 6798.159
the influence of that

6794.48 --> 6799.36
as part of the over-encompassing design

6798.159 --> 6807.839999999999
and long-term

6799.36 --> 6807.839999999999
development of us all

6817.92 --> 6822.159
right anyway i'm gonna round out the
