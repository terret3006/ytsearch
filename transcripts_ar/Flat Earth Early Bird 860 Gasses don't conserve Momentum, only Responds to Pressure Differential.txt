weather today is

79.84 --> 86.0
i don't know what it is it's cloudy

82.88 --> 89.83999999999999
at least

86.0 --> 93.6
and there's a lot of moist in the air

89.84 --> 97.119
i don't know what that yeah why

93.6 --> 101.91999999999999
but it has been

97.119 --> 105.119
raining on and off yesterday evening

101.92 --> 107.36
throughout the night even so i guess

105.119 --> 109.84
that's why it's kind of moist

107.36 --> 111.52
and there's still like small pools of

109.84 --> 115.84
water

111.52 --> 117.6
everywhere slowly evaporating

115.84 --> 119.60000000000001
but yeah right now it's really clouded

117.6 --> 121.83999999999999
there's no snow or anything coming out

119.6 --> 121.83999999999999
of it

123.2 --> 131.28
but warm out there it is not

128.879 --> 131.28
all right

132.879 --> 135.2
so

136.72 --> 143.84
it is sunday the 11th

139.84 --> 143.84
of april 2021

144.16 --> 149.84
ah hello brent m first in chat good to

147.44 --> 149.84
see you

153.519 --> 162.08
so yeah yesterday show was

158.56 --> 165.12
extra long and

162.08 --> 168.4
well i was

165.12 --> 171.92000000000002
really tense not

168.4 --> 174.0
in a great mood but yeah

171.92 --> 177.28
i got a lot of support and that

174.0 --> 180.319
certainly has changed my mood

177.28 --> 184.08
and i was able to basically get proper

180.319 --> 186.879
food again and some bears i have to be

184.08 --> 186.87900000000002
honest about that

188.56 --> 194.159
right but yeah overall that that is not

191.28 --> 196.879
even the most expensive part

194.159 --> 198.79999999999998
and it feeds it actually feeds so i eat

196.879 --> 202.239
less when i do that

198.8 --> 202.239
it's kind of weird how that works out

203.599 --> 209.92
hello sea unders yes you can talk here

207.599 --> 213.2
you're right there

209.92 --> 217.28
if you look at the screen on the left

213.2 --> 220.959
you see a chat which is a direct youtube

217.28 --> 223.44
chat copy and you can see yourself right

220.959 --> 223.44
there so

224.4 --> 229.519
right also a bit of a weird situation i

227.2 --> 232.23899999999998
found out afterward

229.519 --> 234.239
yesterday is that somebody apparently

232.239 --> 236.08
paypaled me

234.239 --> 238.959
and then i banned them because i thought

236.08 --> 242.48000000000002
they were a troll

238.959 --> 242.48
so that was kind of silly of me

243.36 --> 250.4
right it was uh yeah his account kevin's

247.04 --> 255.12
horizons i apparently banned him

250.4 --> 257.28000000000003
even though he sent me like 28 euros

255.12 --> 258.4
through paypal so yeah i haven't blocked

257.28 --> 260.55999999999995
him sorry about that

258.4 --> 261.75899999999996
but he already said that in the emails

260.56 --> 266.96
back

261.759 --> 270.47900000000004
and thank you so you should be able to

266.96 --> 272.63899999999995
get in the chat again

270.479 --> 276.71999999999997
just goes to show that i might have

272.639 --> 276.72
become a little oversensitive to

277.12 --> 280.08
to the trolling

280.24 --> 284.56
how have i not been getting enough

281.919 --> 284.56
nutrition

284.72 --> 289.04
i didn't say that i never said that i

287.44 --> 292.4
don't get enough nutrition

289.04 --> 295.12
i just mentioned yesterday that i was

292.4 --> 298.88
clean out of money and i didn't have

295.12 --> 302.08
say i didn't have any french fries left

298.88 --> 303.759
which is like my i guess my first dinner

302.08 --> 306.0
or late lunch however you want to see

303.759 --> 306.0
that

306.8 --> 310.0
and yeah because of the donations i was

309.039 --> 312.4
able to borrow some

310.0 --> 313.919
money that i will pay back as soon as i

312.4 --> 315.67999999999995
get it in because it takes some time

313.919 --> 317.84
through paypal but it's the quickest of

315.68 --> 317.84000000000003
all

318.4 --> 326.08
and i got some food for that i

324.24 --> 328.56
banned you a long time ago but you're

326.08 --> 330.71999999999997
back well if it's really a long time ago

328.56 --> 336.0
i did a full unbanning

330.72 --> 336.0
uh like is it two or three months back

336.32 --> 340.96
so yeah everybody gets a new chance you

338.72 --> 344.16
know

340.96 --> 347.75899999999996
but yeah it's no guarantee if you're

344.16 --> 349.84000000000003
you i don't have cash app

347.759 --> 353.68
i don't think cash app works outside of

349.84 --> 356.4
the united states

353.68 --> 357.919
somebody asked me before i i tried to

356.4 --> 360.15999999999997
figure it out but i don't think it works

357.919 --> 366.15999999999997
outside of the us

360.16 --> 369.199
i think good servant brought it up to me

366.16 --> 372.72
you can send 20.

369.199 --> 374.24
okay well if if you do that please do so

372.72 --> 376.08000000000004
through paypal

374.24 --> 381.84000000000003
shouldn't be too difficult but cash app

376.08 --> 381.84
i i don't have it sorry

388.24 --> 392.16
right and it's never gonna happen

390.4 --> 394.4
because i think it's the united states

392.16 --> 409.84000000000003
only system so

394.4 --> 409.84
but yeah thank you for the sentiment

414.88 --> 419.28
all right in the meantime like the

416.88 --> 419.28
friend

419.599 --> 424.24
that basically borrowed me the money

422.16 --> 426.47900000000004
like she has some

424.24 --> 429.12
you could put your actual paper what the

426.479 --> 431.919
paypal link is in the description box

429.12 --> 437.84000000000003
of the youtube videos see on this it's

431.919 --> 437.84
right there

438.4 --> 444.56
but if you want the link

441.44 --> 446.8
a clickable link here you go i'll put it

444.56 --> 451.84
in chat

446.8 --> 451.84000000000003
it's that simple

457.759 --> 460.8
right or what george sanford posted that

460.16 --> 463.52000000000004
could work

460.8 --> 465.199
uh that's just the email address that i

463.52 --> 468.4
receive it on

465.199 --> 468.40000000000003
hello george sanford

475.039 --> 483.84
green tea ah that's good

479.039 --> 486.96
so yesterday very very busy day overall

483.84 --> 490.4
so much stuff

486.96 --> 490.4
and it kept me up pretty late

491.199 --> 494.479
hey seeking star water

499.039 --> 503.599
try not to gru i will try not to make

501.36 --> 505.599
any gross misquotes

503.599 --> 507.44
god hate on my channel for it what

505.599 --> 510.319
really how

507.44 --> 510.319
how did that happen

512.719 --> 521.839
what did you miss quote

533.44 --> 536.8800000000001
all right so today anyway i'm doing a

535.519 --> 540.5600000000001
just a one hour show

536.88 --> 543.92
i think but i don't know maybe

540.56 --> 547.1199999999999
it'll there more will come out

543.92 --> 549.12
but i'm not like all cramped up

547.12 --> 551.44
with all kinds of things like i kind of

549.12 --> 554.9590000000001
was yesterday

551.44 --> 557.44
so yes that's me

554.959 --> 559.68
lol yeah that's me that's my name that's

557.44 --> 559.6800000000001
right

561.68 --> 568.0799999999999
right so

564.9 --> 568.0799999999999
[Music]

569.839 --> 576.8000000000001
too many zero oh right the

573.12 --> 581.04
uh 660

576.8 --> 583.8389999999999
000 instead of 66 600 right

581.04 --> 585.76
that one wow you got the hate response

583.839 --> 588.8000000000001
for that it was just an honest mistake

585.76 --> 591.8389999999999
but i guess some people get really

588.8 --> 591.8389999999999
nitpicky on that

599.519 --> 605.839
but yeah i remember that that that

601.839 --> 605.839
happened in chat

606.8 --> 613.68
getting hate for a made up speed yeah

610.32 --> 615.9200000000001
that too but for some people

613.68 --> 619.8389999999999
it's not made up it's not made up to

615.92 --> 619.8389999999999
them it's very important

623.6 --> 627.44
right i wonder sometimes like did they

626.72 --> 630.88
get

627.44 --> 634.1600000000001
tests for this like you know like exams

630.88 --> 637.76
tests that they had to pick

634.16 --> 640.88
the right one and if they had to do that

637.76 --> 643.6
whether it is real or anything right

640.88 --> 645.8389999999999
once you have kind of like performed a

643.6 --> 648.5600000000001
test

645.839 --> 649.44
such things then it becomes important to

648.56 --> 652.4799999999999
you

649.44 --> 655.7600000000001
so maybe that's a reason

652.48 --> 655.76
why people get very

657.839 --> 661.0400000000001
engaged when you make a mistake like

660.32 --> 663.44
that even though

661.04 --> 664.399
to you it doesn't really mean anything

663.44 --> 667.2
neither does it

664.399 --> 668.24
to me that much but for people that have

667.2 --> 672.0
had

668.24 --> 675.12
like tests and exams involving

672.0 --> 676.399
like knowing that speed yeah it matters

675.12 --> 678.48
a lot to them

676.399 --> 679.92
because they had a test for it so it is

678.48 --> 683.36
important to them

679.92 --> 685.279
right it's almost instinctual so

683.36 --> 687.44
that would explain why you got so much

685.279 --> 691.76
criticism

687.44 --> 693.6
for that little detail error

691.76 --> 695.4399999999999
right george sanford important for

693.6 --> 703.839
narnia specialists yeah that's a

695.44 --> 703.839
good metaphor

706.86 --> 710.919
[Music]

714.839 --> 717.839
anyway

719.36 --> 722.72
right yes after the flat earth debate no

721.839 --> 725.7600000000001
wait the

722.72 --> 728.32
it was no flatter debate saturday after

725.76 --> 731.279
the flat earth early bird show

728.32 --> 734.399
i went over to 24 7 discord and it was

731.279 --> 734.399
in there quite a while

735.44 --> 742.0790000000001
uh because there were some

739.04 --> 744.0
kind of like smart neutral ballers like

742.079 --> 748.0
ballers that were really trying to

744.0 --> 751.519
get the reasoning mechanics

748.0 --> 753.36
so that really hit some like whoa

751.519 --> 755.279
somebody that can see but there's still

753.36 --> 758.24
a baller it's like whoa that's

755.279 --> 759.6
like i'm bumping into me from 20 years

758.24 --> 763.04
ago because i

759.6 --> 765.76
was like that too and it was very

763.04 --> 767.92
interesting back and forth conversation

765.76 --> 769.12
should be able to check payphone okay

767.92 --> 773.8389999999999
okay thank you

769.12 --> 773.839
i will thank you very much

784.32 --> 789.12
nice wow thank you that's even more than

787.839 --> 792.0790000000001
20 euros

789.12 --> 792.079
thank you very much

794.639 --> 796.88
huh

798.399 --> 801.839
wow oh

803.12 --> 806.8
man this is really helping guys

812.079 --> 816.4799999999999
like i'm not sure yet whether i should

815.36 --> 819.6
basically drop

816.48 --> 821.519
my original ideas because

819.6 --> 825.9200000000001
yesterday was a moment you know that not

821.519 --> 825.92
just the cash influx is gonna change

827.6 --> 832.0790000000001
although i've said it before it's just

829.68 --> 834.16
that i just get this feeling and even

832.079 --> 836.079
through dreams guys even through my own

834.16 --> 840.24
dreams like i gotta move on

836.079 --> 842.88
it's like it's complicated to explain

840.24 --> 846.0
but even dark world visions

842.88 --> 849.6
related it's just like my ego

846.0 --> 853.36
from the other side is really

849.6 --> 855.36
sick about me being stuck in this

853.36 --> 858.16
position now me being stuck in this

855.36 --> 860.32
position has all like it's the tactical

858.16 --> 863.519
choice it's very complicated

860.32 --> 866.32
right explain it like i can do i can use

863.519 --> 867.519
very specialized things and because this

866.32 --> 870.48
is all i do

867.519 --> 871.76
in a way it has my full attention and

870.48 --> 873.76
focus and clarity

871.76 --> 876.639
aside from freaking trolls getting in

873.76 --> 876.639
the way sometimes

877.6 --> 885.279
i lost my point uh

881.76 --> 887.36
right there's that but it's just that

885.279 --> 888.48
there's a part of me that's just like

887.36 --> 892.8000000000001
really telling

888.48 --> 895.6800000000001
like get the [ __ ] on with it man

892.8 --> 898.079
get on with it like you can do it like

895.68 --> 901.12
i'm starting to realize now that

898.079 --> 904.4799999999999
i've been also trying to basically

901.12 --> 906.5600000000001
fend off that development

904.48 --> 908.72
like even from within my teens and i had

906.56 --> 912.4799999999999
no grip of that whatsoever and it was

908.72 --> 916.399
based on

912.48 --> 920.0
experiences of trying

916.399 --> 923.279
but during all that time i had

920.0 --> 925.6
no like atmospheric control i had no

923.279 --> 929.199
control over myself

925.6 --> 932.8000000000001
like i had no control of basically

929.199 --> 935.12
focusing my will and like

932.8 --> 935.8389999999999
ignore the counter friction kind of

935.12 --> 938.079
thing it's

935.839 --> 939.6800000000001
it's very ethereal it's complicated to

938.079 --> 940.7199999999999
explain it's just i had less grip on

939.68 --> 943.3599999999999
myself

940.72 --> 945.6800000000001
and i've just figured out i have more i

943.36 --> 947.1990000000001
have more grip on myself i can probably

945.68 --> 949.279
do these things now

947.199 --> 950.959
where i just got completely in my own

949.279 --> 952.959
way in the past

950.959 --> 955.8389999999999
and it's not even my consciousness it's

952.959 --> 958.2399999999999
just my feelings and my instincts just

955.839 --> 959.759
would just go like uh this is all wrong

958.24 --> 961.839
everything should be different

959.759 --> 963.279
it's like oh yeah yeah are we oh that's

961.839 --> 963.6
brilliant everything should be different

963.279 --> 966.88
yeah

963.6 --> 970.639
guess what it's not get the [ __ ]

966.88 --> 971.279
over it man just learn to deal with it

970.639 --> 974.88
now

971.279 --> 977.6
i feel that i might be finally

974.88 --> 978.399
ready to deal with all that i've

977.6 --> 981.44
certainly had

978.399 --> 984.24
psychological training and

981.44 --> 986.24
also very important dealing with sudden

984.24 --> 987.759
gamma outbursts and that's probably

986.24 --> 989.839
going to happen the rest of my life

987.759 --> 991.519
because of the way how i am and how i

989.839 --> 993.44
compose myself

991.519 --> 996.16
so that's probably going to happen like

993.44 --> 997.9200000000001
even in freaking work

996.16 --> 1000.0
the thing is though i have a lot of

997.92 --> 1002.3199999999999
training now so all those things that i

1000.0 --> 1004.639
feared that would ruin me that i would

1002.32 --> 1008.5600000000001
get pushed in a corner

1004.639 --> 1012.399
right socially wherever i would try to

1008.56 --> 1016.2399999999999
get work i might finally be able to

1012.399 --> 1019.04
prevent that it's just a realization

1016.24 --> 1020.48
so i think i should try again i'm not

1019.04 --> 1023.199
sure if it's gonna work

1020.48 --> 1024.0
but i got this feeling like i owe it to

1023.199 --> 1028.48
my freaking

1024.0 --> 1028.48
ego to finally try it again

1029.6 --> 1034.48
and who knows maybe it will actually

1031.919 --> 1037.2800000000002
help my financial situation

1034.48 --> 1039.3600000000001
right it might i don't know if it will

1037.28 --> 1042.48
it i'm going to basically

1039.36 --> 1044.799
enter negotiating

1042.48 --> 1047.3600000000001
laying down my situation in front of

1044.799 --> 1050.96
like the person that

1047.36 --> 1052.0
has the list of jobs and then advises

1050.96 --> 1055.1200000000001
you i'll do

1052.0 --> 1056.64
that i've done that before now i'll be

1055.12 --> 1059.36
able to do it

1056.64 --> 1061.679
with more to present and more control

1059.36 --> 1063.28
over myself who knows what

1061.679 --> 1066.5590000000002
what kind of thing will come up who

1063.28 --> 1068.72
knows what they will look at me and see

1066.559 --> 1070.96
certain things in me that before say

1068.72 --> 1072.559
like two years ago even they could not

1070.96 --> 1075.76
see that

1072.559 --> 1080.96
now maybe they will

1075.76 --> 1083.039
right so i i will

1080.96 --> 1083.58
i will kind of like have to engage with

1083.039 --> 1085.28
this

1083.58 --> 1087.52
[Music]

1085.28 --> 1089.84
and see if there is still a possibility

1087.52 --> 1093.36
for it

1089.84 --> 1095.4399999999998
right and then if i tried then

1093.36 --> 1098.24
and it didn't work out at all then at

1095.44 --> 1098.24
least i tried

1099.12 --> 1102.9599999999998
can't say look really forward it makes

1101.12 --> 1106.4799999999998
me freaking nervous guys

1102.96 --> 1109.039
really a lot because i just stay away

1106.48 --> 1111.6
from it most of the time and when you do

1109.039 --> 1113.12
yeah the nerves don't go down no they

1111.6 --> 1117.36
only grow worse over time

1113.12 --> 1120.84
i know that right

1117.36 --> 1122.32
so it's kind of like crunching time like

1120.84 --> 1125.12
that

1122.32 --> 1125.12
you have to do it

1128.799 --> 1133.84
wrote a message for you all right

1132.32 --> 1137.84
did you was there a message in the

1133.84 --> 1137.84
paypal let me check again

1156.72 --> 1161.28
all right even though i've been never

1159.039 --> 1162.799
been a flat earther i don't want anyone

1161.28 --> 1165.28
to starve

1162.799 --> 1166.48
if i could end world hunger i would

1165.28 --> 1168.96
really

1166.48 --> 1171.2
good luck irwin stay healthy thank you

1168.96 --> 1171.2
that's

1172.559 --> 1180.16
that's fine i appreciate that

1176.48 --> 1180.16
yeah i don't want to starve either

1185.76 --> 1190.24
right but consider that if you would

1187.84 --> 1193.1999999999998
want to end world hunger

1190.24 --> 1194.4
how are you going to do that it might

1193.2 --> 1198.0800000000002
lead to

1194.4 --> 1201.44
a worldwide massive food waste or

1198.08 --> 1205.12
increased obesity so yeah

1201.44 --> 1205.1200000000001
that's just me being as smart as

1205.2 --> 1208.799
i appreciate the paypal

1209.919 --> 1212.24
all right

1214.4 --> 1218.88
so yeah where was i completely wandered

1217.919 --> 1221.8400000000001
off

1218.88 --> 1225.6000000000001
it was 24 7 discord had a good

1221.84 --> 1229.12
discussion with somebody who was

1225.6 --> 1229.12
they were trying to figure out

1229.28 --> 1233.2
the discussion surrounding both

1231.44 --> 1237.039
terrestrial refraction

1233.2 --> 1239.679
and the paradox of how it is established

1237.039 --> 1241.12
like with the radius and we were like

1239.679 --> 1243.8400000000001
with a baller

1241.12 --> 1244.559
calmly discussing it and i wasn't part

1243.84 --> 1246.9599999999998
of that

1244.559 --> 1249.12
it was really good also because not

1246.96 --> 1252.799
everybody was constantly interrupting

1249.12 --> 1255.28
including the ballers so that just

1252.799 --> 1257.44
gave it a really good conversation it

1255.28 --> 1259.039
made a really good conversation

1257.44 --> 1260.799
don't know if you guys could find it

1259.039 --> 1262.0
back i don't know who of you have might

1260.799 --> 1264.1589999999999
have heard that but it was

1262.0 --> 1265.2
really good so both terrestrial

1264.159 --> 1269.5200000000002
refraction

1265.2 --> 1273.28
as well as uh the idea of air

1269.52 --> 1276.559
moving in lockstep with the earth

1273.28 --> 1281.28
did a big part on that again laying out

1276.559 --> 1284.1589999999999
the situation with where you can emulate

1281.28 --> 1285.6
emulate a setup with the with a force

1284.159 --> 1289.5200000000002
and all that

1285.6 --> 1292.32
and a rotation to see to find out

1289.52 --> 1294.0
conclusively whether aird could move in

1292.32 --> 1298.08
lockstep

1294.0 --> 1302.159
with the rotating medium using the

1298.08 --> 1304.8799999999999
centrifuge closed doughnut system

1302.159 --> 1307.0390000000002
with air in it and then having testers

1304.88 --> 1309.2800000000002
so you could see like what

1307.039 --> 1312.08
is the air moving separately from the

1309.28 --> 1315.12
tube or is it moving with the tube

1312.08 --> 1317.84
as it is spinning that and yeah

1315.12 --> 1319.76
did a very elaborate piece on that over

1317.84 --> 1323.52
24 7 discord

1319.76 --> 1323.52
i think i also might have brought it up

1323.679 --> 1328.159
at the ball busters later i'm not sure

1325.919 --> 1328.159
though

1328.32 --> 1331.6789999999999
i'm not sure what anyway the 24 7

1331.039 --> 1335.28
discord

1331.679 --> 1337.2
was pretty good when it was active there

1335.28 --> 1340.0
and it yeah

1337.2 --> 1340.0
it was good stuff

1341.039 --> 1344.72
because yeah air does not move in

1343.52 --> 1346.8799999999999
lockstep

1344.72 --> 1348.72
with a presupposed rotating earth it

1346.88 --> 1352.7990000000002
can't because air

1348.72 --> 1355.84
can't gather momentum no gas

1352.799 --> 1357.52
can gather momentum it only responds to

1355.84 --> 1360.72
pressure differentials

1357.52 --> 1363.9189999999999
right and that's always like

1360.72 --> 1366.64
including in a container that's

1363.919 --> 1367.039
accelerating whether it's angular wise

1366.64 --> 1370.72
or

1367.039 --> 1375.2
linear there's an acceleration happening

1370.72 --> 1379.52
the air is not going to find momentum

1375.2 --> 1380.72
no it's going to be redistributed based

1379.52 --> 1382.559
on the new

1380.72 --> 1383.76
pressure differential situation and

1382.559 --> 1387.28
that's why in a

1383.76 --> 1390.32
car for example if it's closed off

1387.28 --> 1394.32
and you accelerate with it the air

1390.32 --> 1396.3999999999999
gradient within it starts to shift

1394.32 --> 1398.799
because there's another force introduced

1396.4 --> 1401.2
the whole thing is moving and the air

1398.799 --> 1402.08
is getting pressed basically at the back

1401.2 --> 1405.3600000000001
and that's why

1402.08 --> 1406.72
there's more dense air pressure forming

1405.36 --> 1410.08
at the back of the car

1406.72 --> 1412.48
and less pressure at the front

1410.08 --> 1414.72
slightly evacuating because it is

1412.48 --> 1418.08
euclidean wise still standing still

1414.72 --> 1420.559
just being thrusted forward by the walls

1418.08 --> 1422.3999999999999
of the container that is accelerating

1420.559 --> 1424.48
and this is also why a helium balloon

1422.4 --> 1427.52
will move forward because the less

1424.48 --> 1430.4
pressure is for on the front

1427.52 --> 1431.2
and if you had a balloon with a what is

1430.4 --> 1436.0
it a

1431.2 --> 1436.0
sulfur hexafluoride it would move back

1436.4 --> 1443.8400000000001
because it is still denser

1441.039 --> 1447.039
than the build up pressure in the back

1443.84 --> 1448.9599999999998
as the whole thing is accelerating

1447.039 --> 1450.8799999999999
somebody found a really good video for

1448.96 --> 1453.76
this i don't i hope i

1450.88 --> 1456.159
posted it in the early bird chat because

1453.76 --> 1459.76
it was really good

1456.159 --> 1462.96
let me check it

1459.76 --> 1466.24
so i'll post it in the chat here

1462.96 --> 1469.8400000000001
yes yes i did get it

1466.24 --> 1469.84
right so this video

1470.72 --> 1475.6000000000001
it's not the first video we've seen

1473.52 --> 1477.2
where somebody tests a helium balloon in

1475.6 --> 1479.039
a car but this one

1477.2 --> 1481.039
not only tests the helium balloon in an

1479.039 --> 1482.64
accelerating car but also a sulfur

1481.039 --> 1484.32
hexafluoride balloon i think it's sulfur

1482.64 --> 1486.48
exofluor the heavy gas

1484.32 --> 1487.84
that is suspended by a rope from the

1486.48 --> 1491.039
ceiling

1487.84 --> 1492.1589999999999
so very wealth or very well worth

1491.039 --> 1494.559
checking

1492.159 --> 1496.96
and maybe to use as a reference in an

1494.559 --> 1496.96
argument

1497.36 --> 1504.1589999999999
because air is not susceptible

1500.96 --> 1507.52
by momentum air all gases

1504.159 --> 1510.72
only respond only move

1507.52 --> 1513.2
because of local pressure

1510.72 --> 1514.88
differentials right that's the only

1513.2 --> 1518.799
thing that makes gas move

1514.88 --> 1520.72
gas unlike liquid or a physical thing

1518.799 --> 1523.039
when you throw a physical thing and you

1520.72 --> 1525.919
let go after the motion

1523.039 --> 1527.279
it keeps going it retains momentum and

1525.919 --> 1529.2
it keeps going

1527.279 --> 1531.84
until it is prevented from moving

1529.2 --> 1534.72
further right

1531.84 --> 1536.48
water also it is also subjected to

1534.72 --> 1536.96
turbulence and all that and yeah it

1536.48 --> 1539.039
might

1536.96 --> 1540.24
scatter apart as you throw it but it's

1539.039 --> 1543.44
still susceptible

1540.24 --> 1546.72
by momentum with gas however

1543.44 --> 1550.4
it's not and you can even

1546.72 --> 1553.76
demonstrate this in a balloon

1550.4 --> 1554.159
take a balloon throw it it's going to be

1553.76 --> 1557.12
like

1554.159 --> 1557.8400000000001
boom it's not going to really retain the

1557.12 --> 1561.1999999999998
momentum

1557.84 --> 1564.559
however the rubber is going to retain

1561.2 --> 1566.0800000000002
a little momentum just a little but it's

1564.559 --> 1569.2
not going to really have

1566.08 --> 1570.799
the same built up speed

1569.2 --> 1573.8400000000001
because it's only the rubber that's

1570.799 --> 1578.08
building up momentum the gases within it

1573.84 --> 1581.039
actually cause friction

1578.08 --> 1582.32
because it has to basically displace the

1581.039 --> 1585.36
air

1582.32 --> 1586.6399999999999
outside of the balloon right and yeah

1585.36 --> 1588.9599999999998
when you you can't

1586.64 --> 1590.4
literally grab gas and then throw it

1588.96 --> 1591.039
it's just going to go in all directions

1590.4 --> 1594.159
so

1591.039 --> 1595.84
you can't really demonstrate that but

1594.159 --> 1598.48
gas doesn't have momentum

1595.84 --> 1600.559
it's only it only responds the local air

1598.48 --> 1602.88
pressure differential

1600.559 --> 1603.6
right that's the only thing it responds

1602.88 --> 1606.5590000000002
to

1603.6 --> 1608.08
so it can't move in lock step with any

1606.559 --> 1613.12
kind of rotatory

1608.08 --> 1616.24
scenario like it will never do that

1613.12 --> 1618.0
and i explained that extensively also

1616.24 --> 1619.84
brought it up

1618.0 --> 1622.88
at the ball busters which was kind of

1619.84 --> 1622.8799999999999
like right after

1625.039 --> 1629.679
like i i wasn't i kind of forgot that

1627.679 --> 1632.24
ball busters was going to be live

1629.679 --> 1633.8400000000001
so i was literally at 24 7 discord when

1632.24 --> 1634.559
i got the youtube nervous notification

1633.84 --> 1636.08
oh this is

1634.559 --> 1638.08
like it's going live and i thought like

1636.08 --> 1640.08
this is premiere right

1638.08 --> 1641.36
then i took a look and no it's not a

1640.08 --> 1645.039
premiere

1641.36 --> 1648.32
so i quickly got on the panel and then

1645.039 --> 1648.32
yeah it was part of the show

1650.32 --> 1655.279
so yeah ball busters was pretty good

1652.64 --> 1658.88
more science it's like

1655.279 --> 1662.24
the nth science presentation concerning

1658.88 --> 1665.8400000000001
science the scientific method

1662.24 --> 1666.24
uh yeah it was good after that show was

1665.84 --> 1669.84
over

1666.24 --> 1672.48
i kept hanging around at a very

1669.84 --> 1673.76
interesting long conversation very

1672.48 --> 1676.96
personal

1673.76 --> 1676.96
with flat earth data

1677.12 --> 1683.6
that guy is really smart and

1680.48 --> 1685.1200000000001
he kind of like presented himself a bit

1683.6 --> 1687.9189999999999
like a priest

1685.12 --> 1690.4799999999998
like he attained that function towards

1687.919 --> 1692.96
me and that was really helpful

1690.48 --> 1694.32
i kind of needed that because i have a

1692.96 --> 1697.919
lot of bottled up

1694.32 --> 1700.96
extremities extreme feelings

1697.919 --> 1703.2
dramatics inside

1700.96 --> 1705.3600000000001
and it was good to reflect on and he

1703.2 --> 1705.919
asked me a couple of really complicated

1705.36 --> 1708.1589999999999
questions

1705.919 --> 1711.2
complicated to me like and i did answer

1708.159 --> 1714.0800000000002
some but did make me think

1711.2 --> 1715.039
he asked me so like okay if you're doing

1714.08 --> 1718.72
this for god

1715.039 --> 1718.72
and through christianity and

1718.96 --> 1724.64
like what like he asked me to imagine

1722.64 --> 1728.64
like what would happen be like

1724.64 --> 1730.3990000000001
for you like you're doing it

1728.64 --> 1732.3990000000001
for something right you'll be trying to

1730.399 --> 1735.52
be on the right side you're trying to do

1732.399 --> 1735.52
everything the right way

1735.919 --> 1740.72
no still human still failing of course

1738.799 --> 1743.2
but it's part of the struggle

1740.72 --> 1744.96
but at least you're trying so one could

1743.2 --> 1747.76
conclude

1744.96 --> 1749.919
that you're designated for heaven right

1747.76 --> 1753.84
i hope he's right

1749.919 --> 1756.96
i'm sure it is held doing my best

1753.84 --> 1760.48
for whatever that's worth

1756.96 --> 1763.679
but yeah i told him like

1760.48 --> 1766.08
i bump into complications when i try to

1763.679 --> 1770.0800000000002
imagine this

1766.08 --> 1772.48
because to me

1770.08 --> 1775.039
how it is from the perspective of me

1772.48 --> 1777.2
being alive right now is that heaven

1775.039 --> 1779.76
is the grass is green around the other

1777.2 --> 1782.96
side that you can never reach

1779.76 --> 1785.6
but i know from practical experience

1782.96 --> 1787.6000000000001
that grass that's greener on the other

1785.6 --> 1789.039
side that is within reach that when you

1787.6 --> 1791.9189999999999
get there

1789.039 --> 1793.2
it's not that green anymore and you

1791.919 --> 1796.0800000000002
could even start to miss

1793.2 --> 1798.0
the less the seemingly less green grass

1796.08 --> 1799.36
on the other side that you used to own

1798.0 --> 1801.84
before that right

1799.36 --> 1802.9599999999998
something like that so i explained like

1801.84 --> 1805.6789999999999
maybe

1802.96 --> 1807.6000000000001
the ultimate heaven is that you can just

1805.679 --> 1811.52
finally

1807.6 --> 1814.0
let it all go or something so that maybe

1811.52 --> 1814.96
yeah it's kind of philosophical idea

1814.0 --> 1816.64
that maybe

1814.96 --> 1819.279
when you die and you've done it all

1816.64 --> 1822.64
right that the reward is

1819.279 --> 1826.24
is that it stops

1822.64 --> 1829.919
that you don't continue the suffering

1826.24 --> 1831.76
after that and wouldn't that in a way be

1829.919 --> 1834.24
just sufficient because

1831.76 --> 1835.76
why else would you experience heaven

1834.24 --> 1838.0
like what would it even mean

1835.76 --> 1839.279
unless it is kind of like a next level

1838.0 --> 1842.559
scenario and this is

1839.279 --> 1845.2
the earth life is just the first one

1842.559 --> 1845.9189999999999
then to imagine heaven would be to

1845.2 --> 1849.1200000000001
basically

1845.919 --> 1850.48
in another level continue the same

1849.12 --> 1852.559
struggle

1850.48 --> 1854.88
and then it would be sensible to me to

1852.559 --> 1856.48
start imagining how and like what kind

1854.88 --> 1859.519
of tools would i want to have

1856.48 --> 1861.679
as a spirit beyond life

1859.519 --> 1864.559
right but that's only based on the

1861.679 --> 1867.679
presupposition that there is a struggle

1864.559 --> 1868.399
because when it ends what would heaven

1867.679 --> 1872.48
mean

1868.399 --> 1876.0
like if there's nothing left to develop

1872.48 --> 1879.84
then what what would be the purpose

1876.0 --> 1879.84
of an eternity

1883.679 --> 1891.039
right it's complicated

1887.84 --> 1892.799
and it really is but i've just

1891.039 --> 1895.519
surrendered with it it's like to me it's

1892.799 --> 1899.12
like okay god okay creation

1895.519 --> 1903.1200000000001
i'm really doing my best so

1899.12 --> 1907.4399999999998
i will accept whatever god

1903.12 --> 1910.2399999999998
has in weight for me whether that be

1907.44 --> 1912.0
hell or heaven or will it even be will

1910.24 --> 1914.559
there be any difference

1912.0 --> 1915.6
maybe the hell might seem like the

1914.559 --> 1918.799
heaven

1915.6 --> 1921.84
until you have to let it go again or the

1918.799 --> 1926.24
other way around it's

1921.84 --> 1929.519
i don't know i know enough to understand

1926.24 --> 1931.679
that the superficial approach of it

1929.519 --> 1933.6
is based on the grass is greener on the

1931.679 --> 1936.3990000000001
other side and the will

1933.6 --> 1937.4399999999998
in the moment that perceives that thing

1936.399 --> 1940.1589999999999
out of reach

1937.44 --> 1940.64
that's how we typically envision heaven

1940.159 --> 1943.519
but

1940.64 --> 1944.48
that could mean that how we see it

1943.519 --> 1948.64
literally has

1944.48 --> 1952.96
nothing to do with what it actually is

1948.64 --> 1952.96
it might just be far outside of our

1953.6 --> 1957.519
physically grounded understanding

1960.159 --> 1966.5590000000002
right so i don't know

1963.44 --> 1971.679
if if god wishes to present me with a

1966.559 --> 1971.6789999999999
like eternity of heavenly experience

1971.84 --> 1978.72
then i can't it from this position

1976.0 --> 1979.679
i can't get myself to decide on what i

1978.72 --> 1981.84
would want

1979.679 --> 1982.72
it's like if i choose that it's almost

1981.84 --> 1984.48
like i fail

1982.72 --> 1987.279
or something it's like no god has to

1984.48 --> 1987.279
designate it

1988.84 --> 1993.76
because

1991.84 --> 1996.48
i don't know i think that if i would try

1993.76 --> 1998.8799999999999
to project some kind of heaven

1996.48 --> 1999.84
for myself based on earthly experiences

1998.88 --> 2002.48
then that might

1999.84 --> 2004.0
seep through and then the freaking devil

2002.48 --> 2007.2
out here in the world

2004.0 --> 2010.72
might actually use that against me

2007.2 --> 2014.0800000000002
sounds a bit paranoid maybe but

2010.72 --> 2018.08
it just everything is gravel

2014.08 --> 2020.0
in this physical reality everything is

2018.08 --> 2021.12
so if you wish something even for

2020.0 --> 2033.84
afterlife

2021.12 --> 2033.84
it it is going to figure out

2034.64 --> 2040.159
i don't know if you guys can still

2036.48 --> 2040.159
follow me and this train of thought

2041.2 --> 2045.519
it's you could basically summarize it

2044.24 --> 2050.0
dude

2045.519 --> 2053.2
when the time is there i'll get to it

2050.0 --> 2054.96
when the time is there like if i have

2053.2 --> 2058.879
nowhere else to go but there

2054.96 --> 2060.7200000000003
then then i'll focus on it

2058.879 --> 2064.24
until then i'm just gonna try to follow

2060.72 --> 2064.24
the path do my best

2064.32 --> 2069.2000000000003
wrestle with my own ego and the rest of

2066.72 --> 2069.2
the world

2069.679 --> 2075.839
until it's all done

2076.399 --> 2082.72
if ever before i die who knows

2080.0 --> 2082.72
who knows man

2082.949 --> 2085.9880000000003
[Music]

2086.399 --> 2090.159

double willian double j i had

2090.159 --> 2103.839

2094.399 --> 2103.839
i don't have a car

2111.44 --> 2117.839
and yes i am well

2122.56 --> 2126.16
okay seeking stuff i don't know about

2124.88 --> 2129.359
who's that seth

2126.16 --> 2132.16
speaks jane roberts

2129.359 --> 2132.16
never heard of that

2132.64 --> 2134.7999999999997
but

2136.64 --> 2143.04
if you have kind of some kind of link

2139.68 --> 2146.48
maybe post it in here otherwise

2143.04 --> 2146.48
do it on skype or something

2148.079 --> 2153.599
how do you get around then on a bike a

2150.64 --> 2153.5989999999997
bicycle

2156.839 --> 2159.839
bicycle

2168.16 --> 2175.5989999999997
ah hey sleeping warrior good afternoon

2172.16 --> 2178.24
mass attracting mass nope

2175.599 --> 2180.88
no evidence for that i saw your video

2178.24 --> 2180.8799999999997
you uploaded

2182.56 --> 2188.64
it's a cavendish set up where it was

2184.88 --> 2188.6400000000003
basically wobbling back and forth

2198.839 --> 2201.839
inconclusive

2212.24 --> 2215.839
what make is it

2216.8 --> 2224.1600000000003
dude not gonna tell you

2220.8 --> 2226.48
why the hell do you even care it's just

2224.16 --> 2227.1189999999997
a bike and it's crappy bike okay it

2226.48 --> 2229.599
works

2227.119 --> 2231.92
it's not in danger of collapsing in on

2229.599 --> 2233.76
me so that i get in a horrific accident

2231.92 --> 2235.359
but it's a pretty crappy looking bike

2233.76 --> 2236.8
and i like it that way

2235.359 --> 2238.88
because then at least it's not gonna get

2236.8 --> 2240.6400000000003
stolen

2238.88 --> 2242.0
right so i'm not gonna tell you which

2240.64 --> 2243.92
one it is

2242.0 --> 2257.839
so somebody else could pull some [ __ ]

2243.92 --> 2257.839
prank on me

2258.72 --> 2271.839
hello john bernards good to see you here

2261.92 --> 2271.839
in chat and iron 26.

2280.079 --> 2283.52
george sanford can get pink lighters

2282.16 --> 2285.839
nobody wants to steal them

2283.52 --> 2285.839
lol

2287.119 --> 2291.359
oh hey seeking star wars you found it

2289.68 --> 2295.2
thank you

2291.359 --> 2295.2
thank you for posting that let me take a

2296.839 --> 2299.839
look

2301.68 --> 2304.8799999999997
okay that starts out

2305.92 --> 2309.04
weird i do not have a physical body yet

2308.56 --> 2313.119
i speak

2309.04 --> 2327.839
sounds very channelly to me

2313.119 --> 2327.839
well this is a pretty big book 185 pages

2337.44 --> 2347.2000000000003
hmm all right

2340.96 --> 2347.2
let's see how can i download this thing

2352.079 --> 2355.8390000000004
not there

2366.78 --> 2369.889
[Music]

2380.839 --> 2383.839
um

2388.56 --> 2392.0789999999997
all right yeah i'll keep it in the

2389.839 --> 2395.52
archive

2392.079 --> 2395.52
it does look kind of interesting

2395.599 --> 2402.32
uh hello one big pond

2399.04 --> 2402.32
you love me okay

2404.4 --> 2408.48
i hope that's a platonic form

2408.839 --> 2425.839
although

2411.28 --> 2425.8390000000004
yeah whatever hello welcome to chat

2429.76 --> 2434.48
yes telling a12 i am feeling better

2434.96 --> 2439.599
like not having to worry about whether

2437.52 --> 2441.92
you're going to starve to death

2439.599 --> 2442.88
it's not really going to happen but just

2441.92 --> 2447.599
being

2442.88 --> 2452.0
stuck right because it's not just that i

2447.599 --> 2455.839
can't like buy the food it's also that

2452.0 --> 2459.839
the alternative is that i have more

2455.839 --> 2461.839
time to not do anything about it as well

2459.839 --> 2463.359
and that really is the frustrating part

2461.839 --> 2465.68
to me

2463.359 --> 2468.24
it's not just that i can't get things

2465.68 --> 2468.8799999999997
it's also that i then have more time to

2468.24 --> 2472.0
fill up

2468.88 --> 2473.76
while in that state and that's very

2472.0 --> 2476.64
unpleasant it's almost like

2473.76 --> 2476.6400000000003
getting in prison

2478.0 --> 2481.44
imprisoned not in prison i know i don't

2480.4 --> 2484.48
know what that's like

2481.44 --> 2485.04
never been there clean record perfectly

2484.48 --> 2488.48
green

2485.04 --> 2490.88
so the worst i've seen

2488.48 --> 2494.4
is like a police holding cell when i got

2490.88 --> 2494.4
caught drunk driving one time

2495.44 --> 2499.839
and that didn't last very long either so

2503.119 --> 2505.6800000000003
that was like

2506.4 --> 2510.88
yeah it's like 15 years ago uh

2513.119 --> 2519.52
but yes i am feeling better

2516.48 --> 2523.839
uh right so okay

2519.52 --> 2523.839
20 more books god

2524.0 --> 2528.88
so sounds like he was engaging in

2526.88 --> 2532.48
something similar as to what i'm doing

2528.88 --> 2537.839
except he did it in book format format

2532.48 --> 2537.839
format format

2540.72 --> 2543.7599999999998
because i'm doing a daily show two hours

2542.8 --> 2546.2400000000002
a day for

2543.76 --> 2546.2400000000002
years

2547.68 --> 2550.72
well if you didn't have that then i

2550.24 --> 2553.1189999999997
guess

2550.72 --> 2555.359
writing books would be the next best

2553.119 --> 2555.359
thing

2560.16 --> 2563.68
do you think cryptocurrencies are safe

2562.0 --> 2566.4
from being manipulated by the country

2563.68 --> 2578.319
are you kidding me man i hope that's a

2566.4 --> 2581.52
joke question right

2578.319 --> 2582.56
because no the whole thing about

2581.52 --> 2586.079
controllers

2582.56 --> 2589.44
and how they manipulate is by

2586.079 --> 2590.079
taking ownership and then abusing the

2589.44 --> 2592.319
ownership

2590.079 --> 2593.76
to manipulate things well guess what

2592.319 --> 2596.96
cryptocurrencies

2593.76 --> 2600.0
are a currency they can be bought

2596.96 --> 2602.2400000000002
up and then used to manipulate yeah

2600.0 --> 2603.44
that happens it happens all over the

2602.24 --> 2605.7599999999998
place it happens

2603.44 --> 2606.96
it's already happening there's a red

2605.76 --> 2609.44
like

2606.96 --> 2611.04
it's partly a problem even in the

2609.44 --> 2615.28
company that i'm a part of

2611.04 --> 2615.2799999999997
that there's people in there that are so

2615.359 --> 2620.0
grappled like it can't they don't know

2618.319 --> 2621.7599999999998
who they are but i've heard

2620.0 --> 2623.76
of that that there's people that have a

2621.76 --> 2626.2400000000002
lot of money and invest a lot that are

2623.76 --> 2627.6800000000003
just using it to wreck it

2626.24 --> 2629.68
and like they've been told could you

2627.68 --> 2630.8799999999997
please not do that is this bad for the

2629.68 --> 2633.2
company and they still

2630.88 --> 2636.079
[ __ ] do it every chance they get

2633.2 --> 2639.1189999999997
every can they're like saboteurs right

2636.079 --> 2641.92
so not prone to being manipulated

2639.119 --> 2645.599
good luck with that you want something

2641.92 --> 2647.52
not being manipulated by controllers

2645.599 --> 2649.839
well then you've got to leave currency

2647.52 --> 2649.839
out of it

2650.079 --> 2656.2400000000002
that's right no market

2653.599 --> 2658.7200000000003
no market control if you just have

2656.24 --> 2661.1189999999997
objects you trade

2658.72 --> 2663.52
and based on the value that the person

2661.119 --> 2668.7200000000003
trading is sizing it up as

2663.52 --> 2673.44
based on their stock and what they need

2668.72 --> 2675.9199999999996
then then you evade manipulation control

2673.44 --> 2677.839
right if you're going to use any form of

2675.92 --> 2679.839
currency that has a standard

2677.839 --> 2682.56
it's going to be manipulated that's the

2679.839 --> 2682.56
whole point

2686.96 --> 2690.2400000000002
it's just a matter of how long will it

2689.119 --> 2692.88
take before before

2690.24 --> 2692.8799999999997
you get there

2701.359 --> 2705.2
crypto is useless if the power goes out

2703.44 --> 2708.48
yeah but so is everything else

2705.2 --> 2711.359
so that's not much of an argument right

2708.48 --> 2718.2400000000002
if the power goes out like everything

2711.359 --> 2720.72
crumbles like everything's gone

2718.24 --> 2722.4799999999996
everything is already based on power

2720.72 --> 2724.3999999999996
just one way or the other it's just like

2722.48 --> 2726.72
try to find something that can function

2724.4 --> 2730.56
completely without power

2726.72 --> 2732.64
like even basic things like farms try to

2730.56 --> 2734.72
find a farm that's completely without

2732.64 --> 2736.24
power

2734.72 --> 2737.7599999999998
you're going to have to look very

2736.24 --> 2740.9599999999996
specific like

2737.76 --> 2742.7200000000003
amish farms think they're probably the

2740.96 --> 2746.96
only ones that have that

2742.72 --> 2750.56
now because it's so easy

2746.96 --> 2750.56
it's so easy with electricity

2757.2 --> 2761.68
are there any types of investment that

2759.599 --> 2764.2400000000002
are less likely to be manipulated by the

2761.68 --> 2764.24
controller

2766.48 --> 2769.599
financial you mean

2770.56 --> 2779.119
well look i didn't say

2774.8 --> 2781.76
uh i'm not saying don't do it at all

2779.119 --> 2782.319
right i'm just saying if you're trying

2781.76 --> 2784.1600000000003
to

2782.319 --> 2786.88
if you think that you can get into

2784.16 --> 2790.24
cryptocurrencies and evade control

2786.88 --> 2791.44
good luck with that right because it's

2790.24 --> 2794.319
going to happen

2791.44 --> 2795.92
not saying that it's not a better option

2794.319 --> 2799.359
at the time being

2795.92 --> 2801.2000000000003
right it's certainly an interesting new

2799.359 --> 2804.16
grounds but it's going to

2801.2 --> 2806.64
run into the same dead end eventually

2804.16 --> 2806.64
all of it

2809.28 --> 2816.48
it's very likely to in my opinion

2813.2 --> 2819.5989999999997
then again i am not a crypto specialist

2816.48 --> 2819.92
right it's just the feel of it how it

2819.599 --> 2822.8
was

2819.92 --> 2823.599
worked into the controller's planning

2822.8 --> 2828.1600000000003
because yeah

2823.599 --> 2831.04
they absolutely accounted for it right

2828.16 --> 2832.319
it's being used as a foundation by the

2831.04 --> 2835.7599999999998
planners

2832.319 --> 2845.839
already for some time so

2835.76 --> 2845.8390000000004
evade control right

2847.599 --> 2852.2400000000002
so is your atm card and everything right

2856.839 --> 2859.839
exactly

2866.4 --> 2871.2000000000003
well yeah hello roof and st hobbins is

2869.359 --> 2873.68
not just crypto will be useless

2871.2 --> 2877.2
everything will be useless

2873.68 --> 2879.839
right so cryptos like

2877.2 --> 2880.48
finance you gotta realize that finance

2879.839 --> 2885.04
is only

2880.48 --> 2885.04
secondary to activity

2885.599 --> 2889.28
so if suddenly everything changes so

2887.839 --> 2891.7599999999998
dramatically

2889.28 --> 2895.0400000000004
that you can't perform activity anymore

2891.76 --> 2898.8
the finance is just completely useless

2895.04 --> 2902.48
all of it right finance only

2898.8 --> 2903.2000000000003
works if you trade if there's nothing to

2902.48 --> 2908.079
trade

2903.2 --> 2915.839
or you can't trade finance is useless

2908.079 --> 2915.8390000000004
all of it

2919.599 --> 2924.1600000000003
i wouldn't hold on to cash for too long

2927.119 --> 2930.6400000000003
no no you're not

2940.839 --> 2943.839
dude

2944.079 --> 2948.2400000000002
what do you want to write a book about

2946.16 --> 2951.7599999999998
oh my god

2948.24 --> 2953.4399999999996
no i don't want to write a book

2951.76 --> 2956.0
if i would have wanted to write a book i

2953.44 --> 2958.079
would have already written a book

2956.0 --> 2959.52
it's just that sometimes i feel like i

2958.079 --> 2962.48
would need to write a book

2959.52 --> 2964.079
just to put the ideas in a certain

2962.48 --> 2967.76
format

2964.079 --> 2971.8390000000004
but it's not coming out

2967.76 --> 2971.8390000000004
it's just not working

2994.4 --> 2998.0
right nor will the ones with food one go

2996.319 --> 3001.359
well george sanford the thing is

2998.0 --> 3004.8
though even gold could be used

3001.359 --> 3007.839
as an internal trading mechanism right

3004.8 --> 3008.1600000000003
as a stand-in so let's just say there's

3007.839 --> 3012.64
two

3008.16 --> 3015.52
farms they they make different crops

3012.64 --> 3018.48
one has like goats and the other one has

3015.52 --> 3022.559
a lot of chickens or something

3018.48 --> 3026.16
then yeah they want to trade continually

3022.559 --> 3026.6400000000003
right but to always trade with physical

3026.16 --> 3029.359
stuff

3026.64 --> 3031.04
it can get kind of a hassle so what you

3029.359 --> 3034.319
can do

3031.04 --> 3036.72
is kind of like use replacement

3034.319 --> 3039.119
tokens for it right this is the this is

3036.72 --> 3042.64
kind of like how

3039.119 --> 3045.2000000000003
how that started so you take a coin

3042.64 --> 3047.1189999999997
of gold a certain weight that you both

3045.2 --> 3050.48
agree upon like this

3047.119 --> 3050.48
is what it represents

3051.04 --> 3055.599
and i can't give all this to you now but

3053.92 --> 3057.52
i really need that stuff

3055.599 --> 3059.3590000000004
and they're gonna be like okay well i'm

3057.52 --> 3060.72
gonna trust that you are going to get

3059.359 --> 3062.72
that stuff because you have a farm

3060.72 --> 3065.04
producing it

3062.72 --> 3066.24
and i'll take the coin for now because i

3065.04 --> 3069.2
don't really need

3066.24 --> 3070.0789999999997
that stuff right now but i will go i am

3069.2 --> 3073.1189999999997
going to need it

3070.079 --> 3074.4
right that's how you can still trade

3073.119 --> 3077.599
with gold

3074.4 --> 3081.359
among one another where it

3077.599 --> 3083.599
when the coin becomes a replacement

3081.359 --> 3085.7599999999998
element right that's really what

3083.599 --> 3088.6400000000003
currency is it's a replacement

3085.76 --> 3091.3590000000004
for physical substances for physical

3088.64 --> 3093.5989999999997
things that you're trading

3091.359 --> 3094.64
and you can do that among one another if

3093.599 --> 3097.76
both have

3094.64 --> 3100.16
sufficient trade inventory

3097.76 --> 3102.2400000000002
sizes then hey actually a gold coin or

3100.16 --> 3103.68
whatever can be a great replacement

3102.24 --> 3105.2799999999997
because you don't have to haul a

3103.68 --> 3107.7599999999998
truckload

3105.28 --> 3108.96
full of stuff every time you want to do

3107.76 --> 3111.6800000000003
a trade

3108.96 --> 3112.319
you know you can just take the coin for

3111.68 --> 3115.7599999999998
example

3112.319 --> 3117.599
it's it's very rough example

3115.76 --> 3119.44
you know you could also just do virtual

3117.599 --> 3122.7200000000003
agreements just say okay

3119.44 --> 3125.52
in the books you owe me this

3122.72 --> 3126.72
but hey a i don't know golden coin could

3125.52 --> 3129.04
be a good

3126.72 --> 3133.839
replacement right because it's also hey

3129.04 --> 3133.839
what if suddenly that other farmer dies

3133.92 --> 3137.2000000000003
and then if it was just a promise then

3135.76 --> 3139.44
you got nothing

3137.2 --> 3141.7599999999998
well if you then got the coin then you

3139.44 --> 3142.2400000000002
can potentially use the coin somewhere

3141.76 --> 3151.92
else

3142.24 --> 3154.9599999999996
right that's how finances really work

3151.92 --> 3154.96
hey nathan oakley

3155.839 --> 3162.88
advertising oh sean hawkins is after you

3159.839 --> 3166.64
oh sean hawkins is gonna get you

3162.88 --> 3171.2000000000003
oh no we're so afraid sean hawkins

3166.64 --> 3181.839
leave nathan alone she mean sean hawkins

3171.2 --> 3181.839
leave nathan alone

3190.0 --> 3195.44
all right steamy traveler i totally

3192.839 --> 3198.5589999999997
agree

3195.44 --> 3200.96
yes skills but skills is like

3198.559 --> 3201.6800000000003
constant produce it's a surface surface

3200.96 --> 3206.0
skills

3201.68 --> 3208.48
yeah service skills are super valuable

3206.0 --> 3209.839
because there will always be people

3208.48 --> 3212.88
trying to expand

3209.839 --> 3214.64
building up things

3212.88 --> 3216.0
and yeah they will need people with the

3214.64 --> 3219.1189999999997
skill

3216.0 --> 3222.16
and you don't need to

3219.119 --> 3224.88
save you don't need to save a resource

3222.16 --> 3227.04
in order to perform that right you just

3224.88 --> 3229.6800000000003
need to have the skills you need to have

3227.04 --> 3233.68
the right tools but skills come first

3229.68 --> 3237.04
because you could get the tools quickly

3233.68 --> 3239.68
if necessary if you don't have any tools

3237.04 --> 3239.68
so yes

3240.64 --> 3244.0789999999997
it's very valuable to have these skills

3242.88 --> 3251.839
to have the knowledge

3244.079 --> 3251.8390000000004
on how to do these things

3252.079 --> 3257.8390000000004
like if everything goes to [ __ ] then

3254.16 --> 3257.839
skills will rule the day

3258.64 --> 3262.0
and people with the right skills will be

3261.2 --> 3264.7999999999997
perfectly

3262.0 --> 3265.92
protected by others which have the

3264.8 --> 3269.119
protection skill

3265.92 --> 3271.2000000000003
because that will be needed too in chaos

3269.119 --> 3273.839
people that are just going to say like

3271.2 --> 3274.8799999999997
no i will be a guard i'm a great guard i

3273.839 --> 3276.88
got

3274.88 --> 3279.119
i got the skills i got the talent i got

3276.88 --> 3281.04
the experience i will be a guard

3279.119 --> 3283.2000000000003
i will protect this because it's

3281.04 --> 3284.88
necessary because this needs to exist or

3283.2 --> 3287.359
we all starve to death

3284.88 --> 3287.359
like that

3289.76 --> 3297.5200000000004
but yeah including maintenance skills

3293.359 --> 3301.2
farming and production skills

3297.52 --> 3303.04
like at some point it might be

3301.2 --> 3305.1189999999997
it might come to a point where mega

3303.04 --> 3308.4
factories that do mass production

3305.119 --> 3310.2400000000002
just subtly don't work anymore

3308.4 --> 3311.44
or they're closed or they're destroyed

3310.24 --> 3314.16
or something

3311.44 --> 3316.319
and then yeah who's gonna make the tools

3314.16 --> 3321.839
that everybody needs to use

3316.319 --> 3321.839
for their skills right

3328.72 --> 3335.839
what's this

3336.96 --> 3345.44
wow clay fort santos talk about

3340.64 --> 3345.44
low life what a dumb ass

3346.24 --> 3349.839
said one of your cronies sean hawkins

3351.44 --> 3354.96
because he actually sounded even dumber

3353.76 --> 3363.76
than you do

3354.96 --> 3369.839
so that would make sense

3363.76 --> 3369.8390000000004
wow well sean hawkins

3372.319 --> 3376.319
what's your citation are are you gonna

3375.119 --> 3379.92
show that

3376.319 --> 3383.68
where einstein said that or wrote it

3379.92 --> 3387.599
not being paraphrased by somebody else

3383.68 --> 3389.52
actual citations based on his writing

3387.599 --> 3391.599
and not somebody else's vague

3389.52 --> 3394.079
interpretation of what einstein actually

3391.599 --> 3396.88
meant of which there was a whole lot

3394.079 --> 3399.04
right a lot of people have taken it upon

3396.88 --> 3399.44
themselves to interpret what einstein

3399.04 --> 3401.839
meant

3399.44 --> 3404.4
right they're mostly ignored that's

3401.839 --> 3409.2799999999997
happened a lot so

3404.4 --> 3409.28
you better not be misquoting there

3410.0 --> 3412.799
sean hawkins

3413.2 --> 3419.839
because if you're gonna keep saying that

3415.28 --> 3419.8390000000004
you better deliver some proof for that

3419.92 --> 3425.6800000000003
do red is did you also show it

3423.28 --> 3426.96
did you it's very nice of you oh you

3425.68 --> 3429.52
read it oh really uh

3426.96 --> 3430.96
yeah well we can't check what you read

3429.52 --> 3434.559
why don't you

3430.96 --> 3437.76
show it did you show it

3434.559 --> 3440.96
right citations of his

3437.76 --> 3440.96
in his writing

3442.799 --> 3446.0
did you show any of that or did you just

3445.04 --> 3448.0
talk about it

3446.0 --> 3461.839
and not show anything like you usually

3448.0 --> 3461.839
do sean hawkins

3471.2 --> 3475.359
well christopher newton i don't really

3473.28 --> 3477.28
care

3475.359 --> 3478.64
i'm not trying to reify anything it's

3477.28 --> 3481.0400000000004
just that when people

3478.64 --> 3484.72
say other people said something they

3481.04 --> 3484.72
better well provide some proof for that

3486.96 --> 3490.64
who showed it as i read it

3491.68 --> 3503.839
so where did you read it from

3494.88 --> 3503.839
where did you read it

3519.359 --> 3521.5989999999997
oh

3524.319 --> 3531.839
where do i see myself and the fe

3526.64 --> 3531.839
movement in 10 years from now

3541.119 --> 3544.7200000000003
that's difficult i don't know where

3543.52 --> 3548.16
we're going to be

3544.72 --> 3551.04
is there going to be any internet left

3548.16 --> 3552.799
for us to do that or is it is the

3551.04 --> 3554.799
crackdown going to be complete are we

3552.799 --> 3556.72
just going to be compartmentalized

3554.799 --> 3559.839
pieces of

3556.72 --> 3559.839
social media

3560.48 --> 3564.16
like it might be that technically we're

3563.28 --> 3567.52
going to stay

3564.16 --> 3568.8799999999997
stuck in the same position for as long

3567.52 --> 3573.839
as we hold out

3568.88 --> 3573.839
might be don't know don't know for sure

3575.52 --> 3579.119
or maybe at some point the clamps will

3577.599 --> 3582.1600000000003
come off and we will get

3579.119 --> 3586.0
wider spread attention

3582.16 --> 3589.7599999999998
actually that did proceed in my dark

3586.0 --> 3593.44
bold visions it was really weird

3589.76 --> 3596.1600000000003
trust me it's really freaking weird

3593.44 --> 3597.68
when after all that time suddenly you

3596.16 --> 3601.839
kind of become famous

3597.68 --> 3601.839
that's [ __ ] weird man

3602.0 --> 3607.28
it might happen but if it is gonna

3604.4 --> 3611.28
happen i'm gonna be older

3607.28 --> 3611.28
it's not happening anytime soon i think

3611.44 --> 3615.839
it has a weird weird memories of like

3614.0 --> 3618.48
having interviews like

3615.839 --> 3619.04
on freaking television or whatever that

3618.48 --> 3620.96
was

3619.04 --> 3623.2799999999997
was it even television more like hollow

3620.96 --> 3623.28
vision

3623.68 --> 3629.839
it's weird i don't know

3642.72 --> 3647.1189999999997
all right well sean hawkins no one in

3645.839 --> 3649.44
the floor side

3647.119 --> 3650.6400000000003
flat earth side has been able to debunk

3649.44 --> 3653.68
any of my videos

3650.64 --> 3655.52
or maybe that is because you're a [ __ ]

3653.68 --> 3656.64
and nobody gives a [ __ ] what you say

3655.52 --> 3660.16
because you

3656.64 --> 3661.92
constantly step on your own toes

3660.16 --> 3664.319
you don't know how to dance you're an

3661.92 --> 3667.76
idiot everybody's laughing at you

3664.319 --> 3668.5589999999997
for real right like ballers and trolls

3667.76 --> 3671.3590000000004
like the gas

3668.559 --> 3672.0
light me with like that that's happening

3671.359 --> 3674.72
with me

3672.0 --> 3675.119
well you're actually a person to who

3674.72 --> 3678.3999999999996
that

3675.119 --> 3681.44
actually applies right

3678.4 --> 3682.0
nobody gives a [ __ ] you don't debunk

3681.44 --> 3684.799
anything

3682.0 --> 3686.24
you're an idiot you can barely formulate

3684.799 --> 3690.72
a coherent sentence

3686.24 --> 3691.839
buddy right maybe if you put in a little

3690.72 --> 3694.8799999999997
bit more effort

3691.839 --> 3698.0
maybe try to emulate

3694.88 --> 3701.76
some kind of level of decency then maybe

3698.0 --> 3701.76
people will start to pay attention

3710.839 --> 3713.839
right

3720.96 --> 3726.48
right but actually you got me kind of

3722.96 --> 3729.839
curious because i i wonder when is the

3726.48 --> 3729.839
next mural god

3732.0 --> 3737.119
what are you talking about rufus i'm not

3734.48 --> 3739.92
going up against merle

3737.119 --> 3741.92
it's ridiculous like i'm not going to go

3739.92 --> 3743.76
up again that like i have a bad

3741.92 --> 3746.88
influence on him every time

3743.76 --> 3751.5200000000004
like he thinks i'm evil or something

3746.88 --> 3751.52
because i basically pointed at his flaws

3751.76 --> 3755.8390000000004
because he got arrogant

3756.4 --> 3761.039
merle thinks he's more than he is

3762.48 --> 3770.559
right and he acts upon that belief

3765.599 --> 3770.559
at times makes it kind of messy

3770.72 --> 3775.839
i don't know what i why would i want to

3773.44 --> 3780.0
engage

3775.839 --> 3780.0
it's like to me is like engaging with

3780.839 --> 3783.839
pga

3785.68 --> 3789.2799999999997
like if you could let's let's just put

3788.559 --> 3793.119
it like this

3789.28 --> 3797.119
if you can remember and share with me

3793.119 --> 3801.28
a single coherent consistent

3797.119 --> 3803.039
theory of any form spiritual mechanic

3801.28 --> 3803.8390000000004
any form that merle has actually

3803.039 --> 3807.44
presented

3803.839 --> 3810.799
i'd like to hear about it because so far

3807.44 --> 3814.319
everything from him it's just a bunch of

3810.799 --> 3814.319
incoherent blabbering

3816.079 --> 3821.6800000000003
like yeah yeah he he has some level of

3818.88 --> 3823.52
sensitivity yeah he can pick up things

3821.68 --> 3825.2799999999997
he just doesn't know what the [ __ ] to do

3823.52 --> 3827.44
with it

3825.28 --> 3830.6400000000003
doesn't have the sensibility it doesn't

3827.44 --> 3830.64
have the patience doesn't

3832.079 --> 3836.559
it's a waste of my time right sean

3836.839 --> 3839.839
hawkins

3841.039 --> 3844.0
oh god

3844.24 --> 3848.16
no sean hawkins you're only gaslighting

3847.2 --> 3852.319
yourself

3848.16 --> 3855.2
you are not special boy

3852.319 --> 3856.72
you're not the king you're a dumbass

3855.2 --> 3859.2
stop

3856.72 --> 3859.9199999999996
stop trying to make everybody believe

3859.2 --> 3861.97
like you're

3859.92 --> 3863.599
awesome you're not

3861.97 --> 3867.839
[Music]

3863.599 --> 3867.839
this is really embarrassing

3872.64 --> 3875.839
oh yeah well rufus and hubbins yeah he

3874.88 --> 3879.2000000000003
feels like there's some

3875.839 --> 3880.799
unfinished business yeah and he's never

3879.2 --> 3882.48
going to be able to finish it

3880.799 --> 3884.72
because every time he tries it's going

3882.48 --> 3888.48
to get worse i'm going to

3884.72 --> 3891.52
eventually just break his spirit

3888.48 --> 3894.799
really break it if he keeps on

3891.52 --> 3896.24
trying that out because he's not going

3894.799 --> 3899.92
to be my equal

3896.24 --> 3903.0389999999998
he wants to somehow be my equal right

3899.92 --> 3904.2400000000002
he's not going to be my equal never he

3903.039 --> 3906.96
can't be my equal

3904.24 --> 3907.5989999999997
he's not my equal right i have a range

3906.96 --> 3911.359
of skills

3907.599 --> 3914.559
that he doesn't and he will never have

3911.359 --> 3918.16
right and he's jealous right

3914.559 --> 3920.96
guys merle is freaking

3918.16 --> 3923.2
jealous like really really [ __ ]

3920.96 --> 3926.2400000000002
jealous

3923.2 --> 3929.359
and i understand that and

3926.24 --> 3930.799
yeah when you're jealous genuinely and

3929.359 --> 3933.2799999999997
then you're faced with somebody that

3930.799 --> 3936.72
you're jealous of that actually kind of

3933.28 --> 3940.559
is a little rough and hard

3936.72 --> 3943.5989999999997
on people and direct and

3940.559 --> 3946.6400000000003
not as perfectly angelic

3943.599 --> 3949.3590000000004
and glorious as one could imagine yeah

3946.64 --> 3950.799
it's it's gonna make it worse gonna make

3949.359 --> 3952.48
them more pissed off and

3950.799 --> 3955.119
merle just freaking hates me because

3952.48 --> 3955.119
he's jealous

3957.76 --> 3960.96
and that's never gonna be finished

3959.2 --> 3962.96
business because it's never gonna go

3960.96 --> 3964.079
away he's never gonna be my equal so he

3962.96 --> 3966.079
will always be jealous

3964.079 --> 3969.28
and unless he freaking deals with that

3966.079 --> 3971.44
and then retracts

3969.28 --> 3972.96
it's only going to get worse this ego is

3971.44 --> 3973.839
going to take more grip over him he's

3972.96 --> 3977.039
going to

3973.839 --> 3978.16
show more aromantic tendencies like he

3977.039 --> 3981.119
wants to destroy

3978.16 --> 3983.7599999999998
that things that rubs him the wrong way

3981.119 --> 3986.96
makes him feel bad

3983.76 --> 3990.0
sean hawkins no you don't get to say

3986.96 --> 3990.0
merle is a [ __ ]

3990.24 --> 3995.9199999999996
right he's smarter than you okay

3993.92 --> 3999.2000000000003
well you're not the dumbest person in

3995.92 --> 4003.359
the world absolutely not

3999.2 --> 4006.24
i don't like yeah

4003.359 --> 4007.68
you're smarter than sean hawkins okay i

4006.24 --> 4010.3999999999996
hope it makes you feel better

4007.68 --> 4010.3999999999996
if you hear this

4011.359 --> 4016.24
right steamy traveler well merle is just

4014.0 --> 4019.28
some guy

4016.24 --> 4020.64
he's sometimes on 24 7 disc he goes

4019.28 --> 4024.48
around he's been around

4020.64 --> 4027.2
but merle beauregard

4024.48 --> 4027.2
that's his name

4028.24 --> 4031.839
yeah he is sean hawkins you're a [ __ ]

4030.079 --> 4032.96
[ __ ] you're one of the dumbest people

4031.839 --> 4035.839
i've ever

4032.96 --> 4035.839
heard so

4037.119 --> 4044.7200000000003
right right sean hawkins i've met

4041.28 --> 4048.0
i've bumped into literal

4044.72 --> 4050.24
clinically [ __ ] people

4048.0 --> 4051.2
that are smarter and have more

4050.24 --> 4054.799
sensibility

4051.2 --> 4054.799
than you do sean hawkins

4054.88 --> 4057.119
right

4058.4 --> 4062.079
especially the sensibility part because

4061.119 --> 4063.92
that's what

4062.079 --> 4065.92
people that are [ __ ] are often

4063.92 --> 4067.76
underestimated that they might have some

4065.92 --> 4070.559
instinctual sensibility if it hasn't

4067.76 --> 4072.7990000000004
been ripped away from them by everybody

4070.559 --> 4072.799
right

4074.799 --> 4079.0389999999998
so at that people like

4079.119 --> 4085.44
fictional characters like ah

4082.319 --> 4089.44
man i forgot his name family guy

4085.44 --> 4091.92
the main character like

4089.44 --> 4093.44
that's somebody that does not have any

4091.92 --> 4095.52
freaking sensibility

4093.44 --> 4097.279
at all right he's and he's meant to be

4095.52 --> 4100.64
like that's his character that he's just

4097.279 --> 4104.719
absolutely totally senseless

4100.64 --> 4108.319
a complete idiot like he has

4104.719 --> 4113.52
he is mentally [ __ ]

4108.319 --> 4116.64
officially but he's also just completely

4113.52 --> 4118.56
just idiotic that's really what makes

4116.64 --> 4122.319
him actually [ __ ]

4118.56 --> 4125.52
not just not as quick as other people

4122.319 --> 4126.159000000001
it's complicated like that all you do is

4125.52 --> 4128.400000000001
talk oh

4126.159 --> 4129.5199999999995
look who's talking sean hawkins all you

4128.4 --> 4132.5599999999995
do is talk

4129.52 --> 4133.279
and you lie and you try to gaslight

4132.56 --> 4135.839000000001
people and

4133.279 --> 4136.719
you bluff about your supposed self-worth

4135.839 --> 4138.799
probably

4136.719 --> 4142.96
to project on you to get away of that

4138.799 --> 4142.96
nasty nasty image of reality

4144.839 --> 4147.839
right

4150.48 --> 4153.678999999999
yeah guns have never run rmp good to see

4152.48 --> 4156.3189999999995
you by the way

4153.679 --> 4157.839
you can make sean hawkins eat humble pie

4156.319 --> 4161.279
dude

4157.839 --> 4162.96
never ah that guy's gonna

4161.279 --> 4165.1990000000005
go out in the loo he's gonna walk

4162.96 --> 4167.52
straight into hell thinking

4165.199 --> 4169.678999999999
just telling everybody he's about to

4167.52 --> 4172.839000000001
enter heaven he's gonna do that

4169.679 --> 4175.279
till the end that guy's never gonna

4172.839 --> 4177.5199999999995
recover

4175.279 --> 4180.400000000001
after certain levels of stupid you can

4177.52 --> 4180.400000000001
never recover

4186.56 --> 4189.839000000001
dude [ __ ] off man

4195.6 --> 4200.96
yeah it's getting a little too spammy

4197.28 --> 4200.96
for me so you can just [ __ ] off now

4201.52 --> 4206.8
i i'd like to talk about things that are

4205.12 --> 4210.32
actually interesting and not

4206.8 --> 4212.159000000001
full-blown [ __ ] idiots

4210.32 --> 4213.5199999999995
that think that they're on top of the

4212.159 --> 4217.839999999999
world when they're pretty much

4213.52 --> 4220.88
at the bottom of it in the shaders

4217.84 --> 4223.28
and they're just in denial about it so

4220.88 --> 4227.04
time for you to go sean hawkins good

4223.28 --> 4229.36
luck with debunking every video

4227.04 --> 4231.12
go make a little squirt video about how

4229.36 --> 4234.32
our win banned you

4231.12 --> 4237.28
because he couldn't handle my proof c

4234.32 --> 4239.199
he had to ban me because he knew i was

4237.28 --> 4240.639999999999
debunking it make one of those videos

4239.199 --> 4243.839999999999
you [ __ ] [ __ ]

4240.64 --> 4245.280000000001
go ahead there's thousands of them right

4243.84 --> 4246.64
there's thousands of these types of

4245.28 --> 4248.719
videos of people just

4246.64 --> 4249.84
gaslighting everything because they

4248.719 --> 4251.76
can't handle me

4249.84 --> 4253.6
they can't handle what i do they can't

4251.76 --> 4257.360000000001
handle what i am

4253.6 --> 4259.76
so they have to make these declarations

4257.36 --> 4262.48
about how they were victorious over me

4259.76 --> 4265.6
without ever having done a single thing

4262.48 --> 4267.599999999999
it's all just stupid bluff garbage right

4265.6 --> 4270.320000000001
so go make one of those videos

4267.6 --> 4271.360000000001
okay oh yeah and by the way i'm not

4270.32 --> 4273.679
gonna watch it

4271.36 --> 4273.679
duh

4279.36 --> 4286.799999999999
ooh hello j.m

4283.52 --> 4290.88
laylar did he actually

4286.8 --> 4296.0
ah that's a rough question no

4290.88 --> 4299.52
not literally it's it's complicated look

4296.0 --> 4303.04
if you want to see what that discussion

4299.52 --> 4306.2390000000005
was about jm laylor

4303.04 --> 4310.0
then you have to watch the original

4306.239 --> 4313.04
watch the original right because bob

4310.0 --> 4314.08
did say things now if you want to listen

4313.04 --> 4315.92
to that clip without

4314.08 --> 4317.679
digging through everything and

4315.92 --> 4321.84
everything

4317.679 --> 4321.84
then just go

4322.48 --> 4329.678999999999
to samson's channel samson it's a

4325.28 --> 4332.88
regular follower here and

4329.679 --> 4343.04
he has one video uploaded and that is

4332.88 --> 4346.88
that video

4343.04 --> 4350.64
he basically took the the samples out

4346.88 --> 4353.679
altered the sound somewhat so it can be

4350.64 --> 4356.2390000000005
yeah be copyright struck or anything

4353.679 --> 4359.04
and he showed some chat conversation he

4356.239 --> 4361.199
had back and forth with him

4359.04 --> 4363.12
all right so if you want to know exactly

4361.199 --> 4364.0
what he said and all that just watch it

4363.12 --> 4367.92
back

4364.0 --> 4367.92
can someone link me to samson's video

4368.239 --> 4371.839999999999
i'll try to find it

4372.8 --> 4379.04
to dig through the channels let's see

4375.84 --> 4380.88
samson where are ya

4379.04 --> 4385.84
right but i don't really like to talk

4380.88 --> 4385.84
about it though

4386.4 --> 4389.199
if you don't mind

4396.239 --> 4401.5199999999995
right so here is the link

4398.92 --> 4404.2390000000005
[Music]

4401.52 --> 4404.2390000000005
figure it out

4406.96 --> 4414.32
right because it's not just

4410.8 --> 4416.8
it's also just the way he did it right

4414.32 --> 4417.679
the perfect tranquility with which he

4416.8 --> 4419.4400000000005
laid it down

4417.679 --> 4420.96
like he was perfectly comfortable with

4419.44 --> 4421.759999999999
it i would not be able to do that

4420.96 --> 4425.84
without just

4421.76 --> 4429.6
going into absolute madness

4425.84 --> 4429.6
anger madness right after that

4429.84 --> 4436.08
right but he did and you can

4432.88 --> 4438.32
listen back to that and know what i mean

4436.08 --> 4441.12
and hey it's okay for bringing it up

4438.32 --> 4444.639999999999
it's a genuine point of concern for you

4441.12 --> 4447.84
and you want to know so here you go

4444.64 --> 4449.6
i wouldn't want to deprive you of that

4447.84 --> 4452.0
if you actually want to know and get

4449.6 --> 4454.8
back to me you know it

4452.0 --> 4455.44
i would like to know whether you agree

4454.8 --> 4458.4800000000005
about

4455.44 --> 4458.48
my stance on it

4465.52 --> 4469.1990000000005
right because i really did think that he

4467.36 --> 4471.5199999999995
just went over a line that you should

4469.199 --> 4475.28
never cross

4471.52 --> 4477.84
it's very spiritual line

4475.28 --> 4478.719
right it's one of those lines that

4477.84 --> 4483.1990000000005
typical

4478.719 --> 4484.159
elites out there and holy the hollywood

4483.199 --> 4486.639999999999
elites

4484.159 --> 4487.44
yes they're called that's the line they

4486.64 --> 4490.56
typically

4487.44 --> 4494.08
like to overstep as much as they can and

4490.56 --> 4498.8
i just felt like bob was doing that

4494.08 --> 4511.199
and unforgivable to me it's unforgivable

4498.8 --> 4514.320000000001
but yeah enough about that

4511.199 --> 4515.44
steamy traveler well that would have

4514.32 --> 4518.159
been nice would it

4515.44 --> 4518.5599999999995
wouldn't it unfortunately no i don't

4518.159 --> 4521.679
have

4518.56 --> 4524.719
all my shows archived it's way too much

4521.679 --> 4526.96
but i do have my flat earth talk

4524.719 --> 4528.2390000000005
my flutter talks i have them all

4526.96 --> 4530.08
archived because they're

4528.239 --> 4532.5599999999995
more important that's the beginning

4530.08 --> 4534.48
stages when i started to develop

4532.56 --> 4536.080000000001
my cosmogeny really put it down the

4534.48 --> 4539.199
holographic sun

4536.08 --> 4539.679
the rectangular looping model all these

4539.199 --> 4541.839999999999
things

4539.679 --> 4542.719
are in there and that's like four years

4541.84 --> 4544.88
ago now

4542.719 --> 4545.84
right so i got the ones that really

4544.88 --> 4550.64
really matter

4545.84 --> 4553.76
i got it but i don't have

4550.64 --> 4556.96
the room

4553.76 --> 4557.52
even on my computer or the at the time i

4556.96 --> 4560.56
don't have

4557.52 --> 4563.84
the proper software to archive every

4560.56 --> 4567.1990000000005
freaking early bird show i ever did

4563.84 --> 4571.1990000000005
i don't have it i'm sorry although

4567.199 --> 4574.4
i have asked like if anybody else

4571.199 --> 4576.4
would consider that it's worth it

4574.4 --> 4577.759999999999
then i would be very thankful if

4576.4 --> 4581.44
somebody else basically

4577.76 --> 4584.56
would download every video that i made

4581.44 --> 4587.36
and at some point maybe the channel will

4584.56 --> 4590.080000000001
just completely break or whatever and

4587.36 --> 4593.28
then i'd be like oh man

4590.08 --> 4596.88
you had it stored right can

4593.28 --> 4598.8
can we transfer this somehow yeah

4596.88 --> 4609.4400000000005
but i don't have the storage room even

4598.8 --> 4613.84
on my computer

4609.44 --> 4615.919999999999
but i have i have saved like uh

4613.84 --> 4618.159000000001
yeah all my flatter talks and i have

4615.92 --> 4620.96
saved

4618.159 --> 4624.159
uh quite a chunk of the early virtue

4620.96 --> 4626.56
like the first 200 or something i got

4624.159 --> 4628.32
but after that it just became too much

4626.56 --> 4630.56
of a hassle and it takes up too much

4628.32 --> 4630.5599999999995
room

4630.64 --> 4634.719
i didn't also this software i used which

4633.199 --> 4636.48
was a free software kind of

4634.719 --> 4638.719
expired it didn't work anymore i

4636.48 --> 4640.879999999999
constantly have issues with that

4638.719 --> 4642.32
maybe at some point when i'm gonna take

4640.88 --> 4645.4400000000005
a step back or something

4642.32 --> 4648.159
we're gonna get a lot of energy boost

4645.44 --> 4650.08
i'm going to pick back up and try to

4648.159 --> 4653.199
archive everything again

4650.08 --> 4655.84
continue it because it is really a

4653.199 --> 4656.5599999999995
big bother doing it takes up a lot of

4655.84 --> 4659.6
time and it's

4656.56 --> 4659.6
freaking boring

4662.88 --> 4666.719
on a jump drive what

4675.6 --> 4680.159000000001
i what what do you mean a jump drive

4681.12 --> 4684.48
no but look

4684.88 --> 4688.159000000001
i look it could probably fit on my

4687.199 --> 4690.879999999999
computer

4688.159 --> 4692.5599999999995
even though it will just continue taking

4690.88 --> 4693.1990000000005
up more and more and more space over

4692.56 --> 4696.719
time

4693.199 --> 4696.719
as long as i do daily shows

4696.8 --> 4701.04
but it's mostly just a lot of hassle to

4699.44 --> 4702.799999999999
download it

4701.04 --> 4705.28
like there's i don't have any system

4702.8 --> 4706.320000000001
that can quickly download like multiple

4705.28 --> 4708.88
episodes

4706.32 --> 4709.679
or like a thing that would say okay

4708.88 --> 4713.28
download

4709.679 --> 4715.679
every video of this channel go just

4713.28 --> 4716.719
bang the whole thing that would be

4715.679 --> 4718.159
awesome

4716.719 --> 4720.0
because then i have to just freaking

4718.159 --> 4722.879999999999
click one single button

4720.0 --> 4724.719
i got it all yeah it might take forever

4722.88 --> 4726.8
but it just not something that i

4724.719 --> 4728.8
constantly have to check like oh did it

4726.8 --> 4730.719
get through oh it's broken again i have

4728.8 --> 4732.56
to retry oh slowly this video is

4730.719 --> 4733.76
restricted from downloading i can't

4732.56 --> 4735.1990000000005
download it for no

4733.76 --> 4738.56
apparent damn reason because that's

4735.199 --> 4738.5599999999995
happened right

4740.88 --> 4744.56
convert to mp3 for a fraction of the

4742.96 --> 4745.92
well that's not even necessary george

4744.56 --> 4748.88
sanford

4745.92 --> 4750.64
you can just down the resolution because

4748.88 --> 4753.92
it's the resolution

4750.64 --> 4758.320000000001
the video that really makes it the most

4753.92 --> 4761.36
uh storage space consuming

4758.32 --> 4764.239
so just don't do it full high-res and

4761.36 --> 4764.239
then works great

4765.12 --> 4771.04
let me see over

4768.56 --> 4771.04
what the

4774.84 --> 4782.8
dammit

4777.04 --> 4791.84
let's see let's see how big one of these

4782.8 --> 4791.84
files is for reference

4807.679 --> 4814.32
right okay

4811.04 --> 4816.159
one hour show from like flat earth early

4814.32 --> 4819.84
bird number 30

4816.159 --> 4819.839999999999
is 148 megabytes

4821.28 --> 4823.599999999999
okay

4824.8 --> 4835.1990000000005
so let's just say 200

4828.56 --> 4835.1990000000005
times 860.

4837.44 --> 4847.839999999999
that's a 172 gigabytes well it's not

4841.12 --> 4847.84
even that much

4859.44 --> 4864.96
that's why you take video but dude i

4862.96 --> 4867.12
can't take video out

4864.96 --> 4869.28
video is very important i literally do

4867.12 --> 4871.84
visual descriptions and all that

4869.28 --> 4872.5599999999995
if the video is out it's just me talking

4871.84 --> 4874.639
and then

4872.56 --> 4875.84
you half of the time when i get very

4874.639 --> 4878.4800000000005
specific

4875.84 --> 4881.84
it's going to be a hassle to figure out

4878.48 --> 4881.839999999999
what i was even talking about

4884.32 --> 4890.5599999999995
two hours showing audio 111 megabytes oh

4887.28 --> 4894.239
goody that's not that much less

4890.56 --> 4894.2390000000005
i'd rather do it with video then

4897.679 --> 4900.88
do the chats get preserved no they don't

4900.08 --> 4904.88
but

4900.88 --> 4907.28
the chat in the video does

4904.88 --> 4911.04
and that's an important factor that's

4907.28 --> 4911.04
one of the reasons why i did it

4912.159 --> 4916.0
because yeah youtube chats are kind of

4915.12 --> 4920.48
unstable

4916.0 --> 4922.4
they can be afterward edited

4920.48 --> 4924.0
they can mess with it there can just

4922.4 --> 4929.92
turn it off

4924.0 --> 4930.88
right i have very little say over that

4929.92 --> 4933.52
yeah well video

4930.88 --> 4934.4800000000005
is necessary your stanford it is it's

4933.52 --> 4937.280000000001
necessary

4934.48 --> 4938.799999999999
in the flat earth early word show video

4937.28 --> 4942.719
is necessary

4938.8 --> 4945.28
deal with it right and i just calculated

4942.719 --> 4946.0
it like it's not even gonna take up that

4945.28 --> 4950.0
much

4946.0 --> 4950.0
space comparatively

4952.719 --> 4959.84
so less than i thought

4960.639 --> 4965.28
right it's going to take up

4963.76 --> 4966.88
well it's already a lot of it is in

4965.28 --> 4968.8
there but let's just say that

4966.88 --> 4971.36
none of it was in there it's going to

4968.8 --> 4975.4400000000005
take up 100 what is it 180

4971.36 --> 4977.04
gigabytes or something i have 1.5

4975.44 --> 4980.879999999999
terabytes

4977.04 --> 4984.4
space so

4980.88 --> 4986.159000000001
yeah it can actually fit the downloading

4984.4 --> 4987.12
is just a hassle that's the bigger

4986.159 --> 4990.48
problem

4987.12 --> 4992.4
downloading is annoying slow it's not

4990.48 --> 4996.48
very stable sometimes it just can't

4992.4 --> 4996.48
download a video i don't understand why

4996.8 --> 5001.52
right so anyway i am gonna round out the

4999.36 --> 5006.08
show i already

5001.52 --> 5006.080000000001
kept going for another 25 minutes extra

5007.36 --> 5011.599999999999
but yeah downloading videos

5011.679 --> 5014.96
if somebody here or anybody listening

5014.48 --> 5018.0
knows

5014.96 --> 5019.76
some kind of good program that like

5018.0 --> 5023.6
automatically downloads

5019.76 --> 5027.04
every single video from a channel

5023.6 --> 5029.76
that will be fantastic please let me

5027.04 --> 5031.36
know if there's such a thing

5029.76 --> 5033.04
because if you're going to have to

5031.36 --> 5036.159
download video

5033.04 --> 5039.12
one at a time that's just super

5036.159 --> 5039.12
super annoying

5039.6 --> 5045.04
all right you got to realize i i still

5041.6 --> 5046.0
have like 700 freaking things to

5045.04 --> 5057.84
download then

5046.0 --> 5057.84
right more maybe it's just

5064.8 --> 5071.679
anyway yeah let's drop it yeah

5068.48 --> 5076.32
let's drop it about it i'm done

5071.679 --> 5085.84
with that don't tell me please

5076.32 --> 5085.84
just what to do with this

5087.28 --> 5089.679
all right

5090.23 --> 5095.839999999999

they'll be much appreciated and thanks

5123.92 --> 5129.6
again for all the support

5125.36 --> 5131.44
yesterday it was been a huge help

5129.6 --> 5132.88
it really did kind of change my

5131.44 --> 5136.08
situation around

5132.88 --> 5138.0
for the time being at least although

5136.08 --> 5140.159
i hope this doesn't mean that it's going

5138.0 --> 5144.32
to be pretty much

5140.159 --> 5147.44
vacuous for another week on end

5144.32 --> 5149.44
right because i still need more it

5147.44 --> 5152.839999999999
sounds terrible but i do

5149.44 --> 5154.5599999999995
but at least i can eat for the time
