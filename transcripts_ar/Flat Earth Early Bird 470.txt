82.1 --> 88.80999999999999

126.69 --> 137.019
look at they have and the Sun is really

134.23 --> 142.09
bright but yeah there's a cloud the

137.019 --> 144.85
record in front of it currently but yeah

142.09 --> 147.43
there's just these moments this is

144.85 --> 150.60999999999999
really springtime almost gives me this

147.43 --> 152.739
few of spring break maybe that that

150.61 --> 155.56
moment is coming or sort of here I don't

152.739 --> 159.34
know when is the spring recs supposed to

155.56 --> 162.79
be wasn't it somewhere at the end of

159.34 --> 165.70000000000002
March I'm not sure but yeah it's

162.79 --> 172.019
beautiful it's not windy I've even been

165.7 --> 172.01899999999998
out for groceries without gloves on or

175.62 --> 180.37
scarf or anything because it's just that

178.57 --> 184.6
mild that's really nice weather outside

180.37 --> 189.22
here and yeah I'm finally starting a

184.6 --> 192.459
little early for a change because I did

189.22 --> 199.15
go to bed pretty early yesterday what

192.459 --> 203.709
was it 1 o'clock so I had a good night's

199.15 --> 205.84
sleep a little bit of restlessness but

203.709 --> 209.769
that's because I also ate a really good

205.84 --> 213.37
big meal finally yesterday basically

209.769 --> 215.14000000000001
chilly Oh organic self-made and I

213.37 --> 217.42000000000002
postponed in a long time because I

215.14 --> 222.94
always do that for some reason it's

217.42 --> 225.04
really good and very nourishing mmm was

222.94 --> 227.62
kind of funny because yesterday in the

225.04 --> 230.67999999999998
after the after-show had ended with the

227.62 --> 232.48000000000002
flatter'd debates we had like an or was

230.68 --> 234.87900000000002
it still in the after sure I'm not sure

232.48 --> 236.41
but we had like a almost an hour talk

234.879 --> 241.09
about food

236.41 --> 245.05
like what's your best meals how do you

241.09 --> 247.87
make it I guess that after that I just

245.05 --> 256.78000000000003
couldn't I just had to make that dinner

247.87 --> 258.7
is it right I already did

256.78 --> 262.11999999999995
I did part of it because because I

258.7 --> 265.53999999999996
missed garlic so I started making it

262.12 --> 268.09000000000003
Thursday night and then I figured out oh

265.54 --> 269.74
my god I have no garlic this is how did

268.09 --> 274.23999999999995
how could I forget that so I had to

269.74 --> 277.06
postpone it a Thursday and then Friday I

274.24 --> 280.63
got the garlic and made it and it was

277.06 --> 287.4
delicious and then I went to bed pretty

280.63 --> 290.83
early got a really good night rest yeah

287.4 --> 294.28
it was probably because there was so

290.83 --> 298.63
much fresh red pepper chili pepper in

294.28 --> 300.15999999999997
there that my my guts got a little

298.63 --> 304.87
restless because of it but nothing

300.16 --> 306.67
really bad just I sometimes forget like

304.87 --> 310.74
oh yeah when you usually it's better

306.67 --> 310.74
that you don't go to sleep right away

314.49 --> 322.99
because chilly and sleep kind of get in

318.58 --> 327.72999999999996
each other's way a little right so

322.99 --> 333.25
anyway I got green tea with me and Lexie

327.73 --> 339.28000000000003
was in chat on this Saturday 7th of

333.25 --> 347.919
March 2020 Sun monkey 3d was deftly

339.28 --> 350.36999999999995
first dank x3 20 Amanda you silver

347.919 --> 350.37
umbrella

351.969 --> 367.86899999999997
a GM bandsaw bandit good servant the

360.759 --> 373.36
atom ikan yeah good to see you all yeah

367.869 --> 380.769
yeah chill this is great but I don't eat

373.36 --> 382.659
it too often it's also it really depends

380.769 --> 391.749
on the weather if it's like hot weather

382.659 --> 394.919
then it's actually much nicer I guess

391.749 --> 398.589
that's why they eat it more over in

394.919 --> 401.679
Mediterranean countries I think the

398.589 --> 404.079
Mexico south of America probably

401.679 --> 406.05899999999997
preferred I don't know maybe I'm wrong

404.079 --> 409.569
about I think I think it does kind of

406.059 --> 411.249
like that it's also because Chili

409.569 --> 414.909
Peppers typically grow better at

411.249 --> 417.42900000000003
Mediterranean regions and I think it

414.909 --> 420.099
also works better when you eat it in

417.429 --> 425.31899999999996
those types of climates but anyway I

420.099 --> 428.169
still enjoy it a lot and you can grow it

425.319 --> 434.73900000000003
in this climate I especially if you if

428.169 --> 436.289
you use greenhouses I didn't I've done

434.739 --> 442.599
it myself

436.289 --> 446.049
it works great like I had we me and my

442.599 --> 450.009
ex had like one plant I think or two and

446.049 --> 451.599
we got so many red pepper so many chili

450.009 --> 459.17900000000003
peppers off them and they were just

451.599 --> 464.199
amazing I think we got like 30 or 40 of

459.179 --> 467.22999999999996
two plants in just one season and they

464.199 --> 471.83000000000004
were very small plants

467.23 --> 474.74
hmm right

471.83 --> 481.3
101 rockhound let's see you professor

474.74 --> 489.2
Phil Bell yeah I feel pretty calm today

481.3 --> 492.83
I've I guess it also helps that I in the

489.2 --> 497.47999999999996
last period last week I I kind of slowly

492.83 --> 499.55
but steadily try to get over some stuff

497.48 --> 506.09000000000003
in a sense that things that I had to do

499.55 --> 508.52000000000004
arranged and I just did a lot of it and

506.09 --> 512.7099999999999
that works out I don't know that that

508.52 --> 515.96
works out very well for my for my rest

512.71 --> 518.12
thank you John M for the to Canadian

515.96 --> 523.099
dollar super chat little help big step

518.12 --> 530.75
in the fight for truth yes indeed just

523.099 --> 533.1700000000001
keeping it going kind of planning ahead

530.75 --> 533.17
a little

534.42 --> 537.5799999999999
[Music]

537.639 --> 543.529
because I think I am gonna initiate that

540.23 --> 545.57
GoFundMe but I yeah I can say it all my

543.529 --> 551.48
all I want but I actually have to like

545.57 --> 554.029
get onto that side and do it and I'm I'm

551.48 --> 556.37
gonna try to do that this afternoon or

554.029 --> 558.56
the evening somewhere because tomorrow

556.37 --> 562.94
is another D&D day still gonna have to

558.56 --> 564.68
show because that can work out and but

562.94 --> 566.87
yeah then the rest of the evening I'm

564.68 --> 571.37
gonna be busy with that looking forward

566.87 --> 574.73
to it looking for it yeah to doing the

571.37 --> 578.0
next step that I've been waiting for for

574.73 --> 579.5
a month well prepared this time looking

578.0 --> 589.67
forward to that it's gonna be a good

579.5 --> 591.589
time I think but yeah I really do need

589.67 --> 594.38
an air filter and now of course there's

591.589 --> 597.0790000000001
a lot of things that I need but I think

594.38 --> 600.079
that I can prioritize this you people

597.079 --> 601.9399999999999
agreed it is basically for well for the

600.079 --> 605.4799999999999
show too because it's in this room it's

601.94 --> 607.6400000000001
from a living and it's a worthwhile

605.48 --> 610.04
investment and I joined the one that I

607.64 --> 612.709
had before it broke down for a long time

610.04 --> 615.709
and it was a palpable difference to me

612.709 --> 617.42
because I did test it at periods like

615.709 --> 621.079
turning it off for a while see what's

617.42 --> 626.899
different like just the test if if it's

621.079 --> 630.699
not just all in my mind yeah I I do that

626.899 --> 635.75
every now and then this try to keep on

630.699 --> 637.9699999999999
testing like is this real or they have I

635.75 --> 643.76
just grown accustomed to thinking that

637.97 --> 647.39
it works like that because I in a way I

643.76 --> 650.18
try to be a minimalist to minimize my

647.39 --> 653.269
dependency and try to bypass as much

650.18 --> 655.459
dependencies as I can and the air filter

653.269 --> 658.579
in a way yeah you could consider that

655.459 --> 661.3389999999999
the dependency but it's still it's been

658.579 --> 668.269
very good to me and I'm smoker and that

661.339 --> 672.139
kind of helps reduce the damage a little

668.269 --> 675.7090000000001
in the face of that so anyway enough

672.139 --> 680.119
about that yeah professor Phil Bell and

675.709 --> 691.929
he and he baller claims you want to put

680.119 --> 691.929
down debating

694.08 --> 702.789
[Music]

713.55 --> 717.3599999999999
to yesterday

732.03 --> 736.35
right yeah Owen Benjamin I that's one of

734.76 --> 739.77
the primary things I remember watching

736.35 --> 744.32
was really intense with Crowe triple7

739.77 --> 747.74
and they again went to really up there

744.32 --> 747.74
it's pretty heavy

755.51 --> 758.51
mm-hmm

761.9 --> 767.66
yeah yeah you're so right good servant

765.38 --> 769.67
yeah proficient for philbo you do like

767.66 --> 772.029
to hang around here a lot but that's

769.67 --> 772.029
okay

779.47 --> 783.639
[Music]

794.04 --> 799.74
you make a good point good servant but

796.759 --> 803.57
look Bala should only support me if they

799.74 --> 808.62
can get themselves to support me but

803.57 --> 811.139
yeah I am relatively apologetic towards

808.62 --> 811.769
ballers compared to some other flat

811.139 --> 815.279
earthers

811.769 --> 818.519
and I'm wondering sometimes if that is

815.279 --> 821.3389999999999
even like a good stance to take but it

818.519 --> 824.519
just it just seems to me that despite

821.339 --> 827.339
everything that's happening ballers are

824.519 --> 832.41
just human beings and I think that there

827.339 --> 834.48
in a way spellbound and I wonder

832.41 --> 837.389
sometimes like if they could get

834.48 --> 840.5690000000001
themselves to realize that that is all

837.389 --> 843.389
the case do they really want to continue

840.569 --> 845.279
from a higher perspective like that or

843.389 --> 849.8100000000001
is it really that they just can't get

845.279 --> 853.199
there for some reason so I don't know

849.81 --> 855.93
I'm just trying to think of situation in

853.199 --> 859.43
the future where it could be

855.93 --> 865.8
declassified but without any rigorous

859.43 --> 868.9799999999999
consequences like nothing dramatic as it

865.8 --> 871.319
were it's just like okay wake up and we

868.98 --> 876.529
move on and then help those out that

871.319 --> 876.529
can't really that have trouble with this

879.589 --> 888.5600000000001
I don't know it not like don't mean to

886.16 --> 892.37
down talk to anyone with this but it's

888.56 --> 893.8389999999999
like really old people that are so set

892.37 --> 896.66
in their ways that they're just

893.839 --> 899.589
constantly all day long saying the same

896.66 --> 902.809
story and the things that drove them and

899.589 --> 904.339
pull them through very complex phases in

902.809 --> 907.2199999999999
their life and that just keeps on

904.339 --> 910.49
echoing they're like oh you know this

907.22 --> 913.249
and that happen in my day you know and

910.49 --> 915.11
you you can then attack them for you and

913.249 --> 918.11
everybody knows that it's completely

915.11 --> 920.269
pointless if you then try to attack them

918.11 --> 924.47
for it you know and in a way that is

920.269 --> 932.93
kind of well what I feel that ballers

924.47 --> 935.6
are gonna become and so yeah let that

932.93 --> 939.079
transition just be as gentle as possible

935.6 --> 943.8190000000001
that is that is my personal approach to

939.079 --> 945.5889999999999
it and it's kind of softy and still in a

943.819 --> 948.1289999999999
period when there is a lot of

945.589 --> 951.8000000000001
psychological attacking going around

948.129 --> 954.62
I'm just looking at I don't know maybe

951.8 --> 956.949
in the psychological war I'm just taking

954.62 --> 958.819
it on myself to be more like a medic

956.949 --> 960.8599999999999
because there's gonna be a lot of

958.819 --> 963.319
psychological warfare casualties you

960.86 --> 968.72
know and they they're not taking care of

963.319 --> 971.7199999999999
they're just gonna ya come in spiritual

968.72 --> 974.029
suicide yeah however you want to draw

971.72 --> 979.149
that metaphor right yeah so that is kind

974.029 --> 979.149
of what I see doing myself

984.149 --> 991.06
all right well thank you professor Phil

987.16 --> 993.0699999999999
Bell that I agree to that if somebody

991.06 --> 996.5189999999999
wants to support me then PayPal will

993.07 --> 1001.85
definitely be preferable but hey if you

996.519 --> 1005.67
want to show a message it's super chat

1001.85 --> 1009.0600000000001
then yeah I don't mind too much you know

1005.67 --> 1011.16
but it is real the the super chats I've

1009.06 --> 1013.8599999999999
tried to explain it many times before in

1011.16 --> 1015.93
my current set-up financial setup super

1013.86 --> 1018.839
chats are really just a billboard

1015.93 --> 1022.67
because technically I don't get a lot

1018.839 --> 1025.53
out of it on the long run for now until

1022.67 --> 1028.8
potentially my financial picture changes

1025.53 --> 1030.959
and then it might turn around and be

1028.8 --> 1033.87
more like how it is with Nathan because

1030.959 --> 1037.98
Nathan yeah he does actually get that

1033.87 --> 1040.1399999999999
and then altogether put with his wife's

1037.98 --> 1042.66
income has to be taxed and all that of

1040.14 --> 1044.39
course I think I don't know exactly how

1042.66 --> 1046.98
it works I don't know if it is taxable

1044.39 --> 1050.88
the income over there I don't know

1046.98 --> 1052.89
probably but yeah in my current set-up I

1050.88 --> 1056.7800000000002
don't make enough so they just detract

1052.89 --> 1060.3000000000002
all of it from my social welfare so yeah

1056.78 --> 1063.32
but a still you know if people want to

1060.3 --> 1066.6599999999999
use it as a billboard I don't mind

1063.32 --> 1069.51
it's just don't expect that to be the

1066.66 --> 1071.75
best way to directly support me that's

1069.51 --> 1071.75
all

1088.31 --> 1096.2
right yeah you're talking about another

1092.24 --> 1099.98
field by way like I of course I'm always

1096.2 --> 1102.95
glancing to the more geopolitical new

1099.98 --> 1105.71
situations and all that watch Alex Jones

1102.95 --> 1111.05
as far as I can bear it it's a lot of

1105.71 --> 1113.06
Corona Fair porn that and the fall of

1111.05 --> 1114.74
Russia today and they also constantly

1113.06 --> 1117.11
have it as a subject all the bigger

1114.74 --> 1121.07
platforms Oh everywhere have it as a

1117.11 --> 1123.56
subject one way or the other even though

1121.07 --> 1126.4399999999998
there is now even almost there's a new

1123.56 --> 1131.09
like default opposition opposition

1126.44 --> 1135.3400000000001
coming where well it should be expected

1131.09 --> 1137.3
people just say viruses are fake yeah

1135.34 --> 1140.7099999999998
that was bound to happen

1137.3 --> 1141.86
weird thing is as I explained so many

1140.71 --> 1144.68
weeks

1141.86 --> 1151.52
what is it now over many multiple weeks

1144.68 --> 1152.92
ago there is there is some sign that

1151.52 --> 1156.02
yeah

1152.92 --> 1159.6200000000001
viruses are not exactly as they are

1156.02 --> 1162.95
being portrayed to be effectively so in

1159.62 --> 1165.4599999999998
that sense well yeah viruses as they are

1162.95 --> 1168.71
being presumed are probably fake and

1165.46 --> 1170.72
that's besides the point as to what is

1168.71 --> 1172.13
actually happening in is the media even

1170.72 --> 1175.25
telling the truth as to what is

1172.13 --> 1176.9
happening besides that point the concept

1175.25 --> 1179.6
of viruses as they are explained are

1176.9 --> 1181.64
probably fake doesn't mean that there is

1179.6 --> 1185.54
absolutely nothing and that it is all

1181.64 --> 1188.8400000000001
pure conjured up air it's just that

1185.54 --> 1192.9099999999999
there seems to be things as part of the

1188.84 --> 1198.8
body workings and life that are being

1192.91 --> 1202.0700000000002
miss explained into yeah in into a more

1198.8 --> 1205.22
weaponized interpretation form and that

1202.07 --> 1208.21
is kind of the problem that most of us

1205.22 --> 1212.06
are dealing with this misunderstanding

1208.21 --> 1213.38
but yeah then if you're just gonna say

1212.06 --> 1217.6399999999999
viruses are fake

1213.38 --> 1221.929
then that is like yeah that's yeah that

1217.64 --> 1224.0590000000002
is so monolithic that yet

1221.929 --> 1227.6000000000001
just that's just gonna be trolling if

1224.059 --> 1228.35
you just keep it to that this is what it

1227.6 --> 1234.6789999999999
was about to happen

1228.35 --> 1236.83
and yeah a lot of 10 tense stuff going

1234.679 --> 1236.8300000000002
on

1244.93 --> 1254.29
a weird situation in Afghanistan is like

1251.37 --> 1256.0
yeah it's not nothing super explosive

1254.29 --> 1259.09
yet but it seems like this so these

1256.0 --> 1261.03
Restless things Restless moves are being

1259.09 --> 1265.84
made in all kinds of locations and

1261.03 --> 1269.83
Turkey and Syria and Russia trying to

1265.84 --> 1273.1
stave it off and it's just a lot of

1269.83 --> 1276.07
little things that are potentially

1273.1 --> 1279.27
dangerous or it seemed yeah like

1276.07 --> 1279.27
everybody's making moves

1286.2 --> 1290.8500000000001
so yeah that is bringing a little

1288.359 --> 1298.859
tension but it's nothing super extreme

1290.85 --> 1302.4599999999998
yet anyway I'm not gonna go too much

1298.859 --> 1307.529
into details it's just a lot going

1302.46 --> 1311.69
around it always has been you know but

1307.529 --> 1314.7
now yeah this just like it feels like

1311.69 --> 1317.1000000000001
there's a different part of the chapter

1314.7 --> 1321.029
that is open a different way of doing

1317.1 --> 1324.4189999999999
things that is kind of now being entered

1321.029 --> 1327.239
that phase sorry

1324.419 --> 1332.5490000000002
it's probably very over generalized but

1327.239 --> 1335.6000000000001
yeah a feely feely stuff so anyway we'll

1332.549 --> 1335.6
see what it all leads to

1361.44 --> 1366.66
I wonder really what sometimes what is

1364.44 --> 1369.5700000000002
the point of this coronavirus even like

1366.66 --> 1372.39
because every everywhere it's just like

1369.57 --> 1374.8799999999999
we have to shut this down because of the

1372.39 --> 1377.5500000000002
danger of Korean it's like all these

1374.88 --> 1384.39
things are being suggested and pushed to

1377.55 --> 1387.18
just be shut down like even what is it

1384.39 --> 1389.19
big historical monuments and everything

1387.18 --> 1391.98
around the world like now we have to

1389.19 --> 1394.29
shut it down to prevent Corona situate

1391.98 --> 1397.74
it's like what are they going to just

1394.29 --> 1401.36
shut everything down now like how far

1397.74 --> 1403.74
our peanut people gonna let this go

1401.36 --> 1407.37
because yeah after everything shut down

1403.74 --> 1409.73
then what you know what's the point of

1407.37 --> 1409.7299999999998
all this

1424.59 --> 1430.48
and besides it's also weird like how

1428.409 --> 1432.8500000000001
it's even being presented the fear porn

1430.48 --> 1434.47
story itself off the corona spreading oh

1432.85 --> 1437.859
we got a case here we got a case there

1434.47 --> 1440.789
we're gonna get there oh no well with

1437.859 --> 1445.359
all the stories about it being airborne

1440.789 --> 1448.69
it's like either it is all just complete

1445.359 --> 1451.389
nonsense or everything is already pretty

1448.69 --> 1454.179
much been affected that were the case or

1451.389 --> 1456.279
at least it'd been so widespread that

1454.179 --> 1459.009
there's absolutely nothing left doesn't

1456.279 --> 1462.759
matter how many masks how many cutoff

1459.009 --> 1464.799
points compartmentalization of regions

1462.759 --> 1467.6490000000001
it's not gonna matter it's just it's

1464.799 --> 1470.95
gonna be everywhere it's so it just

1467.649 --> 1473.799
seems so odd and one way they're just

1470.95 --> 1475.539
making the suggestion like we have to do

1473.799 --> 1477.19
this we have to do that to stop

1475.539 --> 1479.889
spreading what at the same time it's

1477.19 --> 1482.739
also being shown like yeah the way it is

1479.889 --> 1484.629
supposedly spreading according to the

1482.739 --> 1488.279
picture according to the reports the

1484.629 --> 1494.049
tests it's already everywhere

1488.279 --> 1498.1
it's like according to the parameters

1494.049 --> 1501.85
given let's see it's it seems like the

1498.1 --> 1506.049
whole narrative really is already out of

1501.85 --> 1507.82
control and and just inconsistent

1506.049 --> 1509.739
because it should be everywhere but why

1507.82 --> 1513.1589999999999
does it wait and why does it take so

1509.739 --> 1515.32
long then and it's it's not a consistent

1513.159 --> 1518.8590000000002
picture with the claims that have been

1515.32 --> 1524.35
laid with what the corona virus is and

1518.859 --> 1528.399
does and that's just undeniable it's

1524.35 --> 1531.9699999999998
just undeniable and so yeah I can say

1528.399 --> 1534.2489999999998
that and be genuinely not afraid of like

1531.97 --> 1540.249
spreading misinformation because it's

1534.249 --> 1542.47
just true it's just it's in the in the

1540.249 --> 1545.8890000000001
information itself it's just there for

1542.47 --> 1551.22
you to conclude it or ignore it and then

1545.889 --> 1551.2199999999998
go with whatever is being said see

1619.08 --> 1628.75
sorry for the long silence I'm just

1621.64 --> 1630.49
reading through some stuff what

1628.75 --> 1633.13
professor Phil Bell half of yours

1630.49 --> 1637.8700000000001
Chinese students are missing what do you

1633.13 --> 1639.94
mean missing missing where do you mean

1637.87 --> 1642.28
online students or actual physical

1639.94 --> 1644.49
school class or what are you talking

1642.28 --> 1644.49
about

1670.14 --> 1681.99
okay well Emily Sencha teks I seems

1679.74 --> 1684.03
you're very young and yeah yeah the

1681.99 --> 1688.41
coronavirus talk makes you nervous right

1684.03 --> 1692.67
so just try to ignore as much of it as

1688.41 --> 1694.38
you can just let the people are gonna

1692.67 --> 1696.54
spite their spiraling out of control

1694.38 --> 1698.7900000000002
once they take it once they take the

1696.54 --> 1701.9099999999999
fear poor and take it the coronavirus

1698.79 --> 1705.27
and there's really nothing you can do

1701.91 --> 1709.53
about it except really just leave them

1705.27 --> 1711.15
to their their fear spiralling just walk

1709.53 --> 1713.34
away that's well how I'm trying to

1711.15 --> 1718.799
approach it but I wouldn't worry too

1713.34 --> 1723.6899999999998
much all right yeah well professor Phil

1718.799 --> 1725.6689999999999
Bell look that what does that mean that

1723.69 --> 1727.38
means that yeah they're not being

1725.669 --> 1731.3400000000001
released basically they're not being

1727.38 --> 1733.919
released so does that mean what that

1731.34 --> 1735.6299999999999
means they are struck by Corona does is

1733.919 --> 1740.5400000000002
that what it means or does it just mean

1735.63 --> 1744.99
that they're not being released to go

1740.54 --> 1748.74
back to the I guess the US or or England

1744.99 --> 1751.3700000000001
there that's that's the data you have

1748.74 --> 1751.3700000000001
right

1765.18 --> 1768.229
[Music]

1775.9 --> 1781.5890000000002
right

1778.47 --> 1781.589
[Music]

1793.97 --> 1797.119
[Music]

1804.48 --> 1807.66
[Music]

1811.69 --> 1827.2
PG tipps T I don't know what that is but

1814.82 --> 1830.03
I'm drinking green teas huh that's right

1827.2 --> 1832.5800000000002
okay well let me translate that for you

1830.03 --> 1834.47
professor Phil well they're not being

1832.58 --> 1836.71
released and some of them have the

1834.47 --> 1836.71
sniffles

1849.11 --> 1856.03
somehow doubt though that they have this

1851.809 --> 1863.47
supposed weaponized version of Corona

1856.03 --> 1865.73
let's find out very unlikely but yeah

1863.47 --> 1867.799
something that most people overlook is

1865.73 --> 1869.72
that what makes the corona virus the

1867.799 --> 1873.74
corona virus is that it is just a

1869.72 --> 1878.3600000000001
typical type of cult a typical type of

1873.74 --> 1879.98
flu and that is normal that like it

1878.36 --> 1883.549
keeps coming back it's part of the

1879.98 --> 1887.0
metabolism you could say you know but

1883.549 --> 1891.47
that's not the story Corona

1887.0 --> 1895.4
of the mutated the hybrid version does

1891.47 --> 1898.1000000000001
aids in in it blah all that the ultimate

1895.4 --> 1901.549
weapon is Corona I'm pretty sure they

1898.1 --> 1907.37
don't have that that seems extremely

1901.549 --> 1913.52
unlikely but the issue is that even with

1907.37 --> 1916.85
preliminary tests at least it yeah it

1913.52 --> 1920.72
will and just the regular flu there will

1916.85 --> 1922.58
show up as a corona virus that's how

1920.72 --> 1924.26
they they look at put it under the

1922.58 --> 1926.1499999999999
microscope and then they see that but

1924.26 --> 1931.61
that does not mean it is that horrific

1926.15 --> 1934.549
mutated version that's the whole point

1931.61 --> 1939.49
they can't test so easy for that and

1934.549 --> 1939.49
they don't not really

1947.25 --> 1953.1
I don't think so anyway it's not like

1950.13 --> 1956.16
I'm read up on to everything that's

1953.1 --> 1959.34
gonna because I just hate I don't like

1956.16 --> 1962.73
even looking into the coronavirus stuff

1959.34 --> 1965.79
because it's all being so on the level

1962.73 --> 1968.58
of fear driven actions and control

1965.79 --> 1972.1499999999999
freakishness and just that frequency is

1968.58 --> 1974.01
just very unpleasant to be in just to

1972.15 --> 1978.18
research the details of what they're

1974.01 --> 1979.86
saying even so I try to stay out of it

1978.18 --> 1981.72
as much as possible because it's just a

1979.86 --> 1984.75
negative influence of being occupied

1981.72 --> 1987.6000000000001
with it and that's that is part of the

1984.75 --> 1989.37
problem that's part of the problem with

1987.6 --> 1991.4699999999998
people getting obsessed over it is that

1989.37 --> 1994.9499999999998
they they get stuck in that frequency

1991.47 --> 1996.69
and then they eventually they get so

1994.95 --> 1998.97
stuck in it that they don't see other

1996.69 --> 2002.18
things anymore they just prioritize that

1998.97 --> 2006.6100000000001
thing over everything else and they lose

2002.18 --> 2006.6100000000001
care for the little things

2019.28 --> 2022.309
[Music]

2024.12 --> 2035.87
oh well Emily Sen shun Dixie that's a

2031.95 --> 2035.8700000000001
kind of an odd name by the ways that

2041.5 --> 2050.77
is that is that Asian in some way and

2046.84 --> 2053.409
anyway as for they'd suppose it cure

2050.77 --> 2056.19
well it just approach it like the the

2053.409 --> 2059.619
flu and the common cold

2056.19 --> 2063.429
vitamin C guaranteed to work guaranteed

2059.619 --> 2065.29
to work I can safely say that guaranteed

2063.429 --> 2067.33
to work vitamin C and you can get that

2065.29 --> 2072.669
in all kinds of ways all kinds of plants

2067.33 --> 2077.3199999999997
can even make it locally get all herbal

2072.669 --> 2080.5299999999997
if you need to and other than that well

2077.32 --> 2083.619
silver colloidal silver especially it's

2080.53 --> 2090.82
very useful also works topically great

2083.619 --> 2092.6490000000003
great stuff and yeah if a disease phase

2090.82 --> 2094.7200000000003
has hit you and you're literally like

2092.649 --> 2098.5
coughing on Chinon trying to recover it

2094.72 --> 2100.54
look make sure you don't try to work

2098.5 --> 2102.22
through that [ __ ] it's absolutely

2100.54 --> 2106.33
important that you give your body enough

2102.22 --> 2108.25
time to rest and in the final phases of

2106.33 --> 2110.89
that after like the worst is over and

2108.25 --> 2113.5
then the fever poop and all that gets

2110.89 --> 2116.7999999999997
things that are specifically nourishing

2113.5 --> 2121.089
to that secondary phase the the cycle

2116.8 --> 2124.8100000000004
and one of my primary recommendation

2121.089 --> 2127.0
would be chicken soup or bone broth in

2124.81 --> 2128.98
that direction but chicken soup works

2127.0 --> 2132.54
excellent and it's kind of common so

2128.98 --> 2136.9900000000002
that works great for restoration and

2132.54 --> 2141.369
yeah that's about it you can do more but

2136.99 --> 2143.7099999999996
that those the combinations of all that

2141.369 --> 2147.76
vitamin C colloidal silver chicken soup

2143.71 --> 2150.58
enough rest it'll be enough and hey if

2147.76 --> 2153.94
you are in fragile health then you got a

2150.58 --> 2156.0989999999997
problem no matter what Dad that's when

2153.94 --> 2158.05
it can become dangerous and then yeah if

2156.099 --> 2160.1800000000003
you have like severe lung issues or you

2158.05 --> 2162.82
had all these operations or anything and

2160.18 --> 2165.97
you then get the flu even the regular

2162.82 --> 2170.32
flu that's kind of dangerous so yeah it

2165.97 --> 2172.54
would be best for those people that they

2170.32 --> 2173.15
have somebody at least looking out for

2172.54 --> 2176.599
them

2173.15 --> 2178.88
checking up because yeah you know good

2176.599 --> 2181.2400000000002
situations could arrive forcibly their

2178.88 --> 2184.609
lungs start to fill up with fluid and

2181.24 --> 2185.8689999999997
they don't have they're not awake enough

2184.609 --> 2187.46
in their body because they're still

2185.869 --> 2189.44
restoring that they don't notice and

2187.46 --> 2191.539
they might choke on it that kind of

2189.44 --> 2199.849
situation but that's only really for the

2191.539 --> 2201.6800000000003
more information they need a nurse

2199.849 --> 2204.26
basically to make sure that they don't

2201.68 --> 2207.6499999999996
that it doesn't go wrong that's it that

2204.26 --> 2209.869
is really all in my view that is all

2207.65 --> 2218.089
that is really required for for the

2209.869 --> 2221.98
whole situation so I hope you take that

2218.089 --> 2221.98
advice to heart Emily

2230.72 --> 2233.8599999999997
[Music]

2254.75 --> 2257.53
good

2260.7 --> 2263.81
[Music]

2287.9 --> 2291.9100000000003
so why are you on about

2297.18 --> 2304.16
Oh God satellites again come on come on

2302.88 --> 2306.029
really

2304.16 --> 2309.98
satellite technology all the

2306.029 --> 2313.759
possibilities all towers it's all towers

2309.98 --> 2317.43
yes you have towers are all semaine

2313.759 --> 2319.559
radio towers are freakin awesome you can

2317.43 --> 2322.16
call them satellites if you want their

2319.559 --> 2325.7690000000002
towers and they work awesome in a very

2322.16 --> 2327.5389999999998
it's very high-tech and yeah just

2325.769 --> 2329.1299999999997
imagine that that was kind of already

2327.539 --> 2336.9
there in the early twentieth century

2329.13 --> 2338.9100000000003
it's pretty incredible yes Ryan

2336.9 --> 2345.2400000000002
artherton I have actually made colloidal

2338.91 --> 2348.69
silver myself with a kit and to get all

2345.24 --> 2352.109
that was kind of expensive but Wow it is

2348.69 --> 2356.91
it it was an awesome investment at the

2352.109 --> 2359.0989999999997
time it was mostly my ex that invested

2356.91 --> 2363.269
in it I convinced her since she's like a

2359.099 --> 2366.809
dentist and yeah she still has it I wish

2363.269 --> 2369.299
I had it it was pretty awesome but a way

2366.809 --> 2373.9100000000003
to make it just with a pure silver rods

2369.299 --> 2376.829
and they yeah a special kind of magnetic

2373.91 --> 2379.589
mixing system and all that that was

2376.829 --> 2381.21
pretty basic but it worked great and the

2379.589 --> 2387.749
colloidal silver that came out of it was

2381.21 --> 2390.4700000000003
excellent excellent all right I'll see

2387.749 --> 2390.47
you later I'm leave

2393.72 --> 2400.8399999999997
right so once you have a system Reiner

2397.66 --> 2406.0899999999997
Thornton to actually make it it becomes

2400.84 --> 2409.57
absurdly cheap because with just a few

2406.09 --> 2411.58
rods but can make like a hundred gallons

2409.57 --> 2414.52
of colloidal silver or something just

2411.58 --> 2417.0299999999997
insane amounts that last multiple

2414.52 --> 2417.03
lifetimes

2417.48 --> 2422.71
it's just that the system to make it and

2420.4 --> 2424.54
make it right because you can go all

2422.71 --> 2426.34
kinds of degrees of quality's colloidal

2424.54 --> 2429.2799999999997
silver but if you want the really good

2426.34 --> 2432.34
stuff yeah it's kind of expensive to get

2429.28 --> 2434.71
the right laboratory kit to make it but

2432.34 --> 2444.67
once you have that it's so cheap it's

2434.71 --> 2446.5
insane that's really nice professor

2444.67 --> 2450.67
field-goal I know you use rockets and

2446.5 --> 2453.88
you see them yeah yeah but those

2450.67 --> 2458.4900000000002
satellite communications you think our

2453.88 --> 2458.4900000000002
satellite that's still just towers sorry

2472.34 --> 2478.51
yeah

2474.59 --> 2481.34
towers I think that still the most

2478.51 --> 2484.34
satellite functions aren't just towers

2481.34 --> 2486.6800000000003
they're just big towers advanced hours

2484.34 --> 2490.73
from they maybe even know how to reflect

2486.68 --> 2491.5099999999998
off of whatever to get around corners

2490.73 --> 2493.34
and [ __ ]

2491.51 --> 2495.38
I don't know how proficient they've

2493.34 --> 2499.9100000000003
become in actually using that

2495.38 --> 2503.36
long-distance signalling systems but

2499.91 --> 2508.25
yeah I just doubt that they generally

2503.36 --> 2511.1600000000003
need even SATA loons for things to

2508.25 --> 2517.22
function it's more like a very very

2511.16 --> 2520.3999999999996
extreme remote extra relay you could put

2517.22 --> 2523.5499999999997
into work if like towers just can't

2520.4 --> 2527.2000000000003
reach it or something in no way but I

2523.55 --> 2529.4
think that that even in the general

2527.2 --> 2532.04
conceptualizations of satellites and the

2529.4 --> 2533.63
alternative set loons which flatters is

2532.04 --> 2538.31
like to forward every time that's

2533.63 --> 2541.46
brought up that even a set loons use is

2538.31 --> 2544.31
just highly overestimated in the face of

2541.46 --> 2550.52
just the sheer power and effectiveness

2544.31 --> 2555.35
of big towers and what they can do with

2550.52 --> 2558.35
them it's just yeah you don't really

2555.35 --> 2560.36
need satellites hanging up there in

2558.35 --> 2562.8399999999997
balloons even to make it work most of it

2560.36 --> 2562.84
I think

2586.17 --> 2592.2000000000003
oh that's fascinating Cleary but but you

2590.099 --> 2594.7200000000003
do get my point right that in the

2592.2 --> 2596.609
general functioning of what we got now

2594.72 --> 2601.4399999999996
the telephones and the internet and all

2596.609 --> 2605.0589999999997
that and the wireless even the beset

2601.44 --> 2607.26
loons are not necessary for that to work

2605.059 --> 2610.5890000000004
doesn't mean that they're not out there

2607.26 --> 2614.46
in some way doing things because we have

2610.589 --> 2618.45
seen them being launched but are they an

2614.46 --> 2620.88
integral part of the functioning of the

2618.45 --> 2637.1699999999996
communication systems in society I

2620.88 --> 2640.25
highly doubt it I did jeffrey bill i'm

2637.17 --> 2640.25
the only one that can

2654.02 --> 2659.09
and our said onion now that's that's a

2656.57 --> 2662.4100000000003
good question how do I know better than

2659.09 --> 2666.02
someone who works in the industry well

2662.41 --> 2668.0899999999997
first off I'm very observant all

2666.02 --> 2670.61
throughout my life and they observe so

2668.09 --> 2673.7000000000003
many things that even at the time that I

2670.61 --> 2676.9900000000002
observed them I could not understand

2673.7 --> 2679.5499999999997
what the hell I was looking at but I

2676.99 --> 2682.52
remembered it though even though not

2679.55 --> 2686.03
consciously it's like it stayed

2682.52 --> 2691.07
available for my consciousness in later

2686.03 --> 2693.71
phases and now I just have a lot of

2691.07 --> 2696.0800000000004
memory that I can dip into even though

2693.71 --> 2698.03
back at the time I had no idea what the

2696.08 --> 2700.64
hell I was looking at doesn't matter

2698.03 --> 2703.88
because I still remember what I was

2700.64 --> 2707.15
looking at and now I understand and it's

2703.88 --> 2709.34
been amazing and I'm so glad that I went

2707.15 --> 2711.26
there I went into places where I just

2709.34 --> 2713.75
felt there's something incredible here

2711.26 --> 2719.75
I'm not competent enough to get it but I

2713.75 --> 2722.72
will and it worked and so I paid a lot

2719.75 --> 2727.49
of attention while not at the same time

2722.72 --> 2729.74
getting entangled and dependent on that

2727.49 --> 2732.2599999999998
thing they're working on which is what

2729.74 --> 2734.6299999999997
most people have people that work on

2732.26 --> 2736.7000000000003
satellites they become entangled with

2734.63 --> 2741.53
the concept they become emotionally

2736.7 --> 2743.18
invested it always happens if you're

2741.53 --> 2744.71
working on something then that you're

2743.18 --> 2746.5099999999998
gonna build a relationship with that

2744.71 --> 2749.3
thing even if it turns out to be fake

2746.51 --> 2751.61
it's just like marrying somebody under

2749.3 --> 2753.73
false pretenses and then you figure it

2751.61 --> 2757.46
out later while it's still going to hurt

2753.73 --> 2759.65
so I paid a lot of attention while all

2757.46 --> 2762.65
these people just do their thing do the

2759.65 --> 2764.87
technical things correctly but don't

2762.65 --> 2766.07
necessarily have a personal awareness of

2764.87 --> 2769.25
the bigger picture of what they're

2766.07 --> 2771.53
working on they may have some story but

2769.25 --> 2773.81
it might not actually connect now I've

2771.53 --> 2776.9300000000003
learned to distinguish the dreams that

2773.81 --> 2778.91
carry people on and the actual

2776.93 --> 2781.8799999999997
technicals that they take very seriously

2778.91 --> 2784.49
and then it is kind of real and then

2781.88 --> 2787.2200000000003
keep all of that apart and then I just

2784.49 --> 2787.9399999999996
figure it out like how do things really

2787.22 --> 2790.85
work

2787.94 --> 2795.32
and where does the make-believe kind of

2790.85 --> 2798.64
fill it in for people and that's just

2795.32 --> 2804.2000000000003
what I do I do not have a paper for this

2798.64 --> 2810.2599999999998
nothing it's my personal ambition you

2804.2 --> 2814.1
could say to get it and I just reflect

2810.26 --> 2816.8900000000003
refract reflect talk a lot to people and

2814.1 --> 2819.11
as I talk I figure things out even

2816.89 --> 2821.6
further it's just how it works I cannot

2819.11 --> 2824.96
explain why it's just how it works and

2821.6 --> 2825.83
it's getting better and I like it I'm

2824.96 --> 2830.39
used to it

2825.83 --> 2832.88
I know myself very well compared to say

2830.39 --> 2835.0
20 years ago it's it's night and day

2832.88 --> 2840.56
difference almost literally and

2835.0 --> 2844.1
symbolically and yeah I don't know why I

2840.56 --> 2846.47
get it but I think I do I have

2844.1 --> 2851.0
confidence in myself and in what I'm

2846.47 --> 2853.85
looking at and I have no bias or at

2851.0 --> 2856.52
least I try to bypass any bias that I

2853.85 --> 2859.2799999999997
become aware of as I am going anywhere

2856.52 --> 2861.89
and so I'm just very careful with the

2859.28 --> 2864.23
information I deal with I treat it to

2861.89 --> 2866.87
the highest of standards and by doing

2864.23 --> 2869.7400000000002
that getting all the delusions out of

2866.87 --> 2872.42
the way that's how the pure stuff

2869.74 --> 2876.0499999999997
remains that's where the gems are that's

2872.42 --> 2878.66
and people feel that and it echoes on

2876.05 --> 2880.8500000000004
and then other people take those same

2878.66 --> 2882.5899999999997
gems and they work towards it at

2880.85 --> 2884.7799999999997
ourselves and they figure it out and

2882.59 --> 2888.5
they get it and they attain it and that

2884.78 --> 2890.75
is how the awakening in a way that goes

2888.5 --> 2896.06
on it's part of what I'm doing and I'm

2890.75 --> 2899.35
not the only one it sounds a bit

2896.06 --> 2902.95
metaphysical probably to a lot of people

2899.35 --> 2902.95
it is what it is

2904.92 --> 2908.05
[Music]

2916.47 --> 2921.83
yeah thanks Patricia Dockery by saying

2919.59 --> 2921.83
that

2939.68 --> 2950.1189999999997
what what camera costs $150,000 what is

2946.25 --> 2954.559
it made out of gold the [ __ ] why would

2950.119 --> 2959.29
it be that expensive what kind of camera

2954.559 --> 2959.2900000000004
is that it's not a bit excessive

2987.15 --> 2990.15
okay

2996.75 --> 3005.0
Yeah right John em me see why would you

3001.67 --> 3012.17
spend $150,000 when you can do it for

3005.0 --> 3015.5
500 that's just outrageous unless you

3012.17 --> 3017.51
have like a really serious argument that

3015.5 --> 3019.73
would make that investment worth it if

3017.51 --> 3023.15
you say like no we have to do this very

3019.73 --> 3026.6
specific set up or it's not gonna work

3023.15 --> 3029.33
the thing that we want to catch you know

3026.6 --> 3033.49
then that could be argued for but come

3029.33 --> 3033.49
on and the scale is just so extreme

3034.3 --> 3050.05
serious it's more than 300 times the

3041.2 --> 3050.0499999999997
price of the GoPro 300 times just saying

3059.73 --> 3062.869
[Music]

3064.069 --> 3074.029
a remote override camera you might be

3070.369 --> 3077.059
onto something more colored they could

3074.029 --> 3081.92
trick us they would certainly try any

3077.059 --> 3083.719
tricking is expensive oh it's so

3081.92 --> 3087.279
difficult to mount a camera on the

3083.719 --> 3090.5190000000002
rocket so difficult

3087.279 --> 3090.519
sure they are

3102.16 --> 3107.62
professor Phil Bell are you suggesting

3104.82 --> 3111.04
that it's so difficult to mount that

3107.62 --> 3114.6099999999997
camera on the rocket because it it it

3111.04 --> 3118.09
involves rocket science is that what

3114.61 --> 3120.63
makes it so unbelievably complex is that

3118.09 --> 3120.63
what you're suggesting

3152.0 --> 3158.46
[Music]

3155.46 --> 3158.46
Wow

3161.99 --> 3167.5699999999997
a camera setup on a rocket is a very

3165.38 --> 3170.33
competent complicated thing to achieve

3167.57 --> 3174.44
but could you maybe perhaps clear up as

3170.33 --> 3176.93
to exactly how it is complicated could

3174.44 --> 3179.78
you enlighten us about the complications

3176.93 --> 3184.25
that have to be worked through for the

3179.78 --> 3186.619
engineers that plan to put that camera

3184.25 --> 3188.21
on the rocket could you please explain

3186.619 --> 3191.09
the dilemmas for me

3188.21 --> 3194.39
professor Phil Bell very interested you

3191.09 --> 3198.04
know I'm somewhat of a problem solver so

3194.39 --> 3198.04
I might be able to help you out there

3205.03 --> 3215.7200000000003
tremendous forces and heat what

3209.06 --> 3218.5099999999998
tremendous forces indeed you mean of

3215.72 --> 3220.9399999999996
reentry I take it you mean of the

3218.51 --> 3224.75
re-entry right because I'm pretty sure

3220.94 --> 3229.2200000000003
that as the rocket goes out there is no

3224.75 --> 3233.72
heat there's no heat so the only place

3229.22 --> 3238.1899999999996
where there is extreme heat is down over

3233.72 --> 3240.95
at the blast engine I install the camera

3238.19 --> 3243.619
over there right that that makes no damn

3240.95 --> 3248.54
sense you're gonna install it more at

3243.619 --> 3250.4900000000002
the top right so what is this extreme

3248.54 --> 3254.6
heat you're talking about you know if if

3250.49 --> 3257.06
extreme heat is a problem well there's

3254.6 --> 3259.94
other ways to solve it you know you

3257.06 --> 3263.32
could simply make a camera that could

3259.94 --> 3266.18
just be outside there film stuff and

3263.32 --> 3270.44
then specifically if the rocket is

3266.18 --> 3274.3999999999996
designed to go out there in space in the

3270.44 --> 3276.23
orbiter and it wants to return yeah

3274.4 --> 3279.83
that's gonna be this suppose it for

3276.23 --> 3285.16
re-entry heat right well you can just

3279.83 --> 3285.16
solve it by just saying okay click

3285.19 --> 3294.14
camera we closed off each shield on top

3290.57 --> 3295.6400000000003
of it problem solved why would you film

3294.14 --> 3299.18
the re-entry even

3295.64 --> 3301.94
why would you need to film that when the

3299.18 --> 3305.12
real issue concerning evidences and all

3301.94 --> 3308.06
that is really the rocket going out into

3305.12 --> 3311.27
space that singular supposed shot from

3308.06 --> 3317.96
the surface ooh and then you see the

3311.27 --> 3319.7
earth becoming a ball that's the real

3317.96 --> 3323.71
thing that you want that camera for

3319.7 --> 3326.12
that's just the launch could do that so

3323.71 --> 3328.19
re-entry is not really an issue for the

3326.12 --> 3333.98
camera if that's the issue then just

3328.19 --> 3338.08
make it that the camera can like ya can

3333.98 --> 3340.43
go back into the rocket that's just a

3338.08 --> 3343.87
retractable system that a heat shield

3340.43 --> 3346.19
could move over it problem solved

3343.87 --> 3348.3199999999997
stresses and vibration well you know

3346.19 --> 3350.96
what stresses and vibration that's all

3348.32 --> 3355.6600000000003
no no heats there is no heat there is no

3350.96 --> 3358.04
heat okay that's not an issue but

3355.66 --> 3360.83
considering tremors yeah of course

3358.04 --> 3364.43
that's an issue but then again that

3360.83 --> 3367.91
issue yeah there's a lot of systems that

3364.43 --> 3371.0499999999997
help that stabilizers you can even use a

3367.91 --> 3376.85
gyroscopic stabilizer for that with a

3371.05 --> 3380.51
tremor cage like even the basic setup

3376.85 --> 3383.69
like how hard disks in good silent

3380.51 --> 3386.1200000000003
computer desktops hard disks they they

3383.69 --> 3388.52
get screwed to a frame right but if you

3386.12 --> 3390.14
do it directly yeah it's very it's gonna

3388.52 --> 3392.87
resonate throughout the whole damn thing

3390.14 --> 3395.2999999999997
because hard disks do is zoom and spin

3392.87 --> 3399.91
so what they do they put these little

3395.3 --> 3402.1400000000003
rubber rings in between it and

3399.91 --> 3404.0899999999997
problem-solve while it basically comes

3402.14 --> 3406.58
down to that if vibration is a problem

3404.09 --> 3408.29
then you just have a vibration counter

3406.58 --> 3409.91
system but it's pretty much the

3408.29 --> 3413.12
framework that the camera is going to be

3409.91 --> 3416.0
sitting in shouldn't be that extremely

3413.12 --> 3418.88
expensive at all might take up a little

3416.0 --> 3421.97
bit more space than just a webcam thing

3418.88 --> 3424.52
you know sure any camera depending on

3421.97 --> 3427.4599999999996
how big is probably gonna sit in another

3424.52 --> 3429.25
box and that box if yeah it's gonna be

3427.46 --> 3431.56
need to be retractable so

3429.25 --> 3434.83
there is going to be a mechanical system

3431.56 --> 3439.57
and a space for it to sink into and

3434.83 --> 3446.89
heatshield to go over done is that all

3439.57 --> 3449.98
really that expensive right so well

3446.89 --> 3452.8599999999997
professor Phil Bell we don't film

3449.98 --> 3454.69
reentry yeah exactly so well what heat

3452.86 --> 3459.4300000000003
what heat are you talking about

3454.69 --> 3461.17
I don't see any heat even on the suppose

3459.43 --> 3464.3199999999997
that rocket launches that we see there's

3461.17 --> 3469.2000000000003
no heat there only heats is that the

3464.32 --> 3469.2000000000003
exhaust what heat are you talking about

3491.55 --> 3498.69
right that's right George Sanford the

3495.75 --> 3500.19
go-fast rocket they had no problem with

3498.69 --> 3502.92
that camera and they'd I'm pretty sure

3500.19 --> 3506.58
they used a relatively basic camera and

3502.92 --> 3508.4700000000003
they had vibration stabilization or I

3506.58 --> 3511.7999999999997
think that because the rocket was

3508.47 --> 3513.2999999999997
spinning it itself that the the

3511.8 --> 3515.6400000000003
ballistic effect of its spinning

3513.3 --> 3517.7400000000002
basically stabilized it and that

3515.64 --> 3521.04
prevents vibration yeah it does that

3517.74 --> 3523.3999999999996
society effect of gyroscope spinning

3521.04 --> 3526.62
it's interesting centripetal force

3523.4 --> 3529.83
stabilizes vibration yeah

3526.62 --> 3534.77
that's part of why ballistics work so

3529.83 --> 3538.95
yeah even that rocket that no problem

3534.77 --> 3542.25
with the basic camera so professor field

3538.95 --> 3544.7999999999997
it sounds like you're kind of

3542.25 --> 3546.33
red-herring the whole issue about this

3544.8 --> 3548.19
supposed to the camera and why it's so

3546.33 --> 3552.12
expensive because it's so difficult yet

3548.19 --> 3554.31
yeah you put forward this is a problem

3552.12 --> 3556.83
that is a problem that is a problem then

3554.31 --> 3559.77
I address each problem especially the

3556.83 --> 3561.96
heat and you still are ignoring what I

3559.77 --> 3564.81
say like what heat there is no heat

3561.96 --> 3566.43
there is no heat when you go up it's

3564.81 --> 3569.64
only at the engines what heater you're

3566.43 --> 3572.6699999999996
talking about there is no heat even the

3569.64 --> 3576.0499999999997
officials about how Rockets live there

3572.67 --> 3576.05
is no heat

3580.42 --> 3586.88
there is no heat any heat that's

3584.14 --> 3590.54
supposedly gonna happen from fast

3586.88 --> 3595.01
traveling it's gonna call off from the

3590.54 --> 3602.7799999999997
air which is colder there is no heat it

3595.01 --> 3605.59
doesn't heat up it doesn't heat up it's

3602.78 --> 3609.11
why do you keep forwarding this it

3605.59 --> 3613.1000000000004
doesn't heat up rockets that supposedly

3609.11 --> 3617.33
go up don't eat up they don't heat up

3613.1 --> 3620.75
why do you keep claiming this they don't

3617.33 --> 3624.0699999999997
heat up can you please stop saying that

3620.75 --> 3636.56
for some reason they heat up they don't

3624.07 --> 3639.92
this is getting really ridiculous yeah

3636.56 --> 3642.62
friction with what with very thin air is

3639.92 --> 3645.9500000000003
that gonna make it heat up really all

3642.62 --> 3648.29
that thin air that is actually really

3645.95 --> 3653.81
cold how is that gonna heat it up makes

3648.29 --> 3656.06
no damn sense doesn't heat up visually

3653.81 --> 3658.13
it doesn't heat up technically

3656.06 --> 3660.17
officially it doesn't even eat heat up

3658.13 --> 3666.59
you're literally just making this [ __ ]

3660.17 --> 3669.53
up the rocket doesn't heat up officially

3666.59 --> 3672.7400000000002
it does not heat up professor Phil Bell

3669.53 --> 3678.23
this is getting really dumb it doesn't

3672.74 --> 3680.62
heat up ya fibration sure doesn't heat

3678.23 --> 3680.62
up though

3692.59 --> 3698.1400000000003
there is heat in the engine it's not the

3696.25 --> 3701.35
rest of the rocket though because it's

3698.14 --> 3702.73
as it is moving very fast it's going

3701.35 --> 3703.81
through thinner and thinner air that's

3702.73 --> 3707.89
getting colder and colder

3703.81 --> 3712.66
that actually cools it off it does not

3707.89 --> 3722.95
heat up are you hearing me professor

3712.66 --> 3726.3399999999997
phil bell it does not heat up if you can

3722.95 --> 3729.04
show me a single supposed demonstration

3726.34 --> 3731.9500000000003
of how a rocket actually heats up as it

3729.04 --> 3734.86
goes upwards then please demonstrate

3731.95 --> 3736.87
that you know I don't even care about

3734.86 --> 3738.61
any fisheye lens in your supposed

3736.87 --> 3741.04
curvature it's going on I don't care

3738.61 --> 3743.98
just show me it the rocket actually

3741.04 --> 3747.0099999999998
heating up as it goes up a single frame

3743.98 --> 3759.52
ever show it show it professor Phil Bell

3747.01 --> 3762.55
come on show it or drop the fiction they

3759.52 --> 3765.52
do do the news is this your rumpus

3762.55 --> 3767.98
moment is this your conjuration that

3765.52 --> 3769.87
you're gonna hang on to forever even

3767.98 --> 3771.97
though there's absolutely no sign that

3769.87 --> 3773.71
it's even officially the case according

3771.97 --> 3776.73
to your supposed body of knowledge

3773.71 --> 3780.55
concerning rocket like what who are you

3776.73 --> 3784.3
who the hell are you who are you to say

3780.55 --> 3791.8
these ridiculous things that's not even

3784.3 --> 3794.4100000000003
official so what are you doing alright

3791.8 --> 3797.5600000000004
are you some kind of PJ of the ballers

3794.41 --> 3804.43
that just makes up [ __ ] that isn't even

3797.56 --> 3807.48
official it does not heat up yeah well

3804.43 --> 3810.49
might vibrate it doesn't heat up though

3807.48 --> 3812.05
well maybe if the vibration because of

3810.49 --> 3814.18
the design not being good enough and

3812.05 --> 3817.3
resonance is building up then maybe the

3814.18 --> 3819.6699999999996
vibration could become so extreme that

3817.3 --> 3821.5
that could cause heat but yeah before

3819.67 --> 3824.26
that it's probably just gonna rip the

3821.5 --> 3825.66
structural integrity apart so then even

3824.26 --> 3827.7000000000003
he'd been a second

3825.66 --> 3830.96
and it's gonna explode long before it

3827.7 --> 3835.769
actually gets any heated so show me

3830.96 --> 3838.7690000000002
where a rocket ascending besides the

3835.769 --> 3841.549
engine parts where it heats up you you

3838.769 --> 3847.499
show me you show me professor Phil Bell

3841.549 --> 3849.66
fantasies globe or expert wannabe

3847.499 --> 3857.16
fantasies that makes up [ __ ] out of

3849.66 --> 3859.3489999999997
nothing if you keep this [ __ ] up they're

3857.16 --> 3860.97
probably just gonna start shaving you

3859.349 --> 3863.839
over at the ballers too because it's

3860.97 --> 3863.839
just ridiculous

3864.72 --> 3872.7999999999997
[Music]

3875.35 --> 3883.06
oh yeah well stone monkey 3d it has to

3879.1 --> 3885.25
do with the amount of pressure even like

3883.06 --> 3890.7599999999998
the stealth fighters or known for that

3885.25 --> 3890.76
is that they go under pressure

3896.82 --> 3904.4300000000003
and yeah then it just works differently

3899.91 --> 3907.62
so those extreme speed speedy things

3904.43 --> 3909.8399999999997
they yeah well they account for I guess

3907.62 --> 3913.23
this train they're under by adapting the

3909.84 --> 3914.88
design to the higher pressure but that I

3913.23 --> 3917.22
don't know exactly how it works but it

3914.88 --> 3924.03
is just pressure yeah

3917.22 --> 3928.8599999999997
professor Phil Bell piss off you at

3924.03 --> 3934.0800000000004
humming fantasies this is getting really

3928.86 --> 3937.56
annoying I don't want any wannabe one of

3934.08 --> 3939.99
these scholarly ballers that make up

3937.56 --> 3942.66
[ __ ] that doesn't even abide by the

3939.99 --> 3943.1699999999996
official narrative get the hell out of

3942.66 --> 3945.12
here

3943.17 --> 3947.4
I don't need fake ballers here I want

3945.12 --> 3948.63
the real thing I want people that

3947.4 --> 3953.4
actually know what the hell they're

3948.63 --> 3955.08
talking about they can be believers they

3953.4 --> 3958.9500000000003
can believe the nonsense that I've

3955.08 --> 3960.69
learned literally take it literal but

3958.95 --> 3962.91
I'm not going to entertain a bunch of

3960.69 --> 3969.63
people that just make up [ __ ] that isn't

3962.91 --> 3972.47
even official this is just embarrassing

3969.63 --> 3972.4700000000003
and

3975.2 --> 3978.2599999999998
[Music]

3978.74 --> 3984.77
so yeah the next time you speak up watch

3983.45 --> 3986.7799999999997
your words because if you're gonna

3984.77 --> 3991.94
double down or if you're gonna add homie

3986.78 --> 3997.15
its banned because I can tolerate a lot

3991.94 --> 4000.43
but I will not accept Fanta cyst

3997.15 --> 4002.2000000000003
misinformation that is not even

4000.43 --> 4004.839
technically correct according to the

4002.2 --> 4007.0
official narrative from somebody

4004.839 --> 4009.24
supposedly defending the ball I will not

4007.0 --> 4009.24
have it

4024.68 --> 4030.89
really so have you have ul manator tell

4029.42 --> 4035.779
me well what is that that the

4030.89 --> 4042.43
temperature of the tip of a rocket as it

4035.779 --> 4046.369
goes up you tell me does it happen to be

4042.43 --> 4050.779
relatively close to I don't know

4046.369 --> 4052.1600000000003
temperature of the air well depends of

4050.779 --> 4055.99
course how much heat is gonna be

4052.16 --> 4058.64
transferred from the engine part maybe

4055.99 --> 4060.14
yeah it could be that for example the

4058.64 --> 4062.8089999999997
engine needs to be cooled down

4060.14 --> 4068.99
effectively so that they used the entire

4062.809 --> 4071.21
framework like as a heat was it the part

4068.99 --> 4073.339
that specifically transfers heat in

4071.21 --> 4074.69
order to help cool the engine if that

4073.339 --> 4076.43
would be required I don't know it all

4074.69 --> 4078.859
depends on the design of the very engine

4076.43 --> 4080.93
in the first place that could be a

4078.859 --> 4083.029
possibility yeah then it would heat up

4080.93 --> 4088.3689999999997
but I don't think that is really how

4083.029 --> 4089.839
they're built because then it would

4088.369 --> 4093.17
literally use the outside like a

4089.839 --> 4101.12
radiator to defend to lose heat I don't

4093.17 --> 4103.81
think that's how they design so yeah

4101.12 --> 4103.8099999999995
it's just

4105.75 --> 4110.4
no have you ever measured the

4108.12 --> 4112.68
temperature of a rocket it's just all

4110.4 --> 4115.71
this stuff like oh look a baller a

4112.68 --> 4117.42
baller out there thinks oh I can ask him

4115.71 --> 4119.91
this question because I'm sure he's

4117.42 --> 4123.4800000000005
never done it and because then he can

4119.91 --> 4126.95
say yes of course I have which in their

4123.48 --> 4131.849999999999
mind is the ultimate pinnacle of winning

4126.95 --> 4134.16
right then they say it even though when

4131.85 --> 4137.01
you actually ask have you know of course

4134.16 --> 4141.12
they didn't because they are a bunch of

4137.01 --> 4145.34
Muppets that literally ask things they

4141.12 --> 4148.92
do not understand literally all manator

4145.34 --> 4150.93
they literally do not understand the

4148.92 --> 4153.57
thing they are asking they just think oh

4150.93 --> 4156.39
this may sound like a wind this could be

4153.57 --> 4159.42
something he hasn't dealt it dealt with

4156.39 --> 4162.33
and that might make him look stupid so

4159.42 --> 4164.04
I'm gonna asking that disregarding that

4162.33 --> 4166.0199999999995
yeah you should know better because

4164.04 --> 4169.83
usually when people ask me that kind of

4166.02 --> 4173.21
thing I asked them if they have done

4169.83 --> 4177.63
something because I know they never have

4173.21 --> 4179.34
it's very rare and if they do then

4177.63 --> 4181.56
though usually already start bragging

4179.34 --> 4184.95
about having done it before I even have

4181.56 --> 4186.780000000001
to ask that question that's that's why

4184.95 --> 4189.75
when I asked that question I'm pretty

4186.78 --> 4192.469999999999
sure I'm right already that's how I work

4189.75 --> 4192.47
I pay attention

4201.07 --> 4204.228999999999
[Music]

4212.87 --> 4232.08
he right yep but all manator do you have

4225.21 --> 4235.04
experience have you actually tested the

4232.08 --> 4240.87
thing that is being talked about that

4235.04 --> 4243.66
profesor feel Bell brought up all right

4240.87 --> 4246.54
that's it goodbye professor Phil Bell I

4243.66 --> 4249.75
warned you and you did it

4246.54 --> 4253.11
I guess that by baller standards you are

4249.75 --> 4256.14
now proud that you feel that oh my god

4253.11 --> 4258.929999999999
if our wind band you that means they

4256.14 --> 4261.570000000001
might be some kind of potential threat

4258.93 --> 4263.76
to them so this probably makes you feel

4261.57 --> 4265.59
better makes you feel more taken

4263.76 --> 4270.0
seriously that you've been banned by me

4265.59 --> 4273.12
or enjoy it do i brag about go to this

4270.0 --> 4277.56
court practicar win ban me man

4273.12 --> 4279.599999999999
yeah he knew it was coming he knew it

4277.56 --> 4282.42
was coming I said I asked something and

4279.6 --> 4284.01
I totally got him I totally got him yeah

4282.42 --> 4286.5
because I said yeah the cameras you know

4284.01 --> 4288.81
cameras on Rockets and the temperature

4286.5 --> 4293.19
of the Rockets and the cameras be

4288.81 --> 4295.530000000001
protected against that and I don't

4293.19 --> 4298.759999999999
remember to risk mm-hmm but yeah I

4295.53 --> 4302.8099999999995
totally got a man because I got banned

4298.76 --> 4302.81
so yeah have fun with that

4309.05 --> 4315.18
yeah well all manator I do have

4311.94 --> 4317.419999999999
experience you see I wasn't to fireworks

4315.18 --> 4321.06
a lot when I was a kid

4317.42 --> 4324.4800000000005
deep into my teens and I did actually

4321.06 --> 4327.93
build firework based rockets so I do

4324.48 --> 4330.75
know something about it I not a lot I'm

4327.93 --> 4333.150000000001
not a real expert what I did something

4330.75 --> 4336.03
with it I've seen schematics I know

4333.15 --> 4338.79
basic rocketry I even just out of sheer

4336.03 --> 4340.74
interest I'm interested in rocket

4338.79 --> 4342.0
engines and the general function and

4340.74 --> 4344.34
looked through that when I was very

4342.0 --> 4348.81
young when I still thought I am gonna

4344.34 --> 4350.25
build a space station yeah then you can

4348.81 --> 4354.06
look into that [ __ ]

4350.25 --> 4356.55
yeah not very deeply though but I know

4354.06 --> 4359.400000000001
enough about it because I know what I've

4356.55 --> 4365.85
looked at was real designs that have

4359.4 --> 4367.98
been used and I remember that yeah you

4365.85 --> 4372.9800000000005
don't have to build them yourself you

4367.98 --> 4376.139999999999
know to learn something about it

4372.98 --> 4379.799999999999
although you do learn a lot about just

4376.14 --> 4389.58
building things and complications and

4379.8 --> 4391.820000000001
design if you do all right it's a it's

4389.58 --> 4397.62
time for a bannings free I see anymore

4391.82 --> 4401.639999999999
anymore shitty shitty declarations by

4397.62 --> 4404.7
people that are gonna tell me and tell

4401.64 --> 4410.33
my chat that I ban professor Phil Bell

4404.7 --> 4413.73
for telling truth come on say it come on

4410.33 --> 4419.73
you know you want to be banned too you

4413.73 --> 4421.799999999999
do because you know I'm never I'm never

4419.73 --> 4426.0599999999995
gonna break it's never gonna happen

4421.8 --> 4428.610000000001
so bring it on tell me tell me how it

4426.06 --> 4430.740000000001
was in just of me to ban professor Phil

4428.61 --> 4435.299999999999
Bell because he was telling the truth

4430.74 --> 4436.83
about rocket tips heating up when they

4435.3 --> 4440.070000000001
go out of the atmosphere even though

4436.83 --> 4441.84
they never do ever and you know this

4440.07 --> 4445.11
there's no footage of that ever

4441.84 --> 4447.150000000001
happening ever and I a fraud and

4445.11 --> 4449.58
nobody's bringing it on and but but he

4447.15 --> 4451.5199999999995
was telling the truth he was telling the

4449.58 --> 4456.05
truth

4451.52 --> 4456.05
come on say it

4471.32 --> 4474.46
I thought so

4479.1 --> 4482.159000000001
[Music]

4503.55 --> 4513.27
yeah Ronnie fashi that's right that's

4507.81 --> 4516.06
right yeah exactly I wasn't even gonna

4513.27 --> 4518.46
bring that up I wasn't even gonna bring

4516.06 --> 4520.5
that up but yes you're right they had

4518.46 --> 4521.01
problems with ice on the tips that's

4520.5 --> 4522.99
right

4521.01 --> 4527.01
so where's this supposed and heat

4522.99 --> 4531.75
problem it's it's dumb the only heat is

4527.01 --> 4534.77
with reentry come on guys they taught

4531.75 --> 4539.33
that [ __ ] in school in the 80s I know it

4534.77 --> 4539.330000000001
why don't you understand

4539.87 --> 4545.45
it's just so dumb it's

4560.63 --> 4565.74
[Music]

4562.82 --> 4567.15
that's right George Sanford it's very

4565.74 --> 4569.849999999999
hard to keep track of all the lies and

4567.15 --> 4572.49
the supposed story when you just want to

4569.85 --> 4575.42
be free want to be free to fantasize

4572.49 --> 4575.42
whatever you want to do

4585.78 --> 4591.15
right stone monkey 3d while the suppose

4588.45 --> 4594.75
that heat re-entry is disposed the

4591.15 --> 4598.139999999999
thermo layer the it's because of

4594.75 --> 4599.58
friction basically of incredible speeds

4598.14 --> 4602.97
but that's how it's supposed to work

4599.58 --> 4604.59
incredible speeds because in space speed

4602.97 --> 4607.5
becomes a lot more relative because it's

4604.59 --> 4611.28
a vacuum or near vacuum so they go a lot

4607.5 --> 4613.26
faster that stuff to slow down and then

4611.28 --> 4615.2699999999995
there's yeah reentry is always supposed

4613.26 --> 4617.13
to be this big issue even in science

4615.27 --> 4618.18
fiction that echoes on like oh if you

4617.13 --> 4621.93
don't have the right angle yeah and

4618.18 --> 4626.76
you'll deflect off and move all that

4621.93 --> 4630.6900000000005
stuff so but yeah the baseline the story

4626.76 --> 4633.02
of the heat of reentry is because the

4630.69 --> 4637.259999999999
increasing air pressure and the friction

4633.02 --> 4639.96
then maybe some special layer in some

4637.26 --> 4642.24
way but it definitely has to do with the

4639.96 --> 4645.06
speed in relation to the increasing

4642.24 --> 4647.67
friction of the the heightened air

4645.06 --> 4649.830000000001
pressure that's why it's supposed to

4647.67 --> 4651.86
heat up and that's why they showed us

4649.83 --> 4655.08
how that looks

4651.86 --> 4659.759999999999
that's why they show that in science

4655.08 --> 4662.76
fiction series when spaceships the fire

4659.76 --> 4665.04
like a comet it's coming like a meteor

4662.76 --> 4668.39
you know that that's why they show that

4665.04 --> 4672.57
because that is officially how it works

4668.39 --> 4680.280000000001
not saying that any of it is real but

4672.57 --> 4682.83
that's how it's supposed to work what do

4680.28 --> 4684.929999999999
you mean Ryan Earth Anton well like you

4682.83 --> 4687.17
like our see what what do you mean our

4684.93 --> 4687.17
see

4701.13 --> 4707.58
there is no friction when getting up to

4703.83 --> 4711.39
that speed that's right that's correct

4707.58 --> 4713.76
because you don't start out going up

4711.39 --> 4716.13
from the bottom of the atmosphere with

4713.76 --> 4718.83
what is it a thousand miles per hour you

4716.13 --> 4721.29
don't start off with the file or may way

4718.83 --> 4723.3
faster whatever it's supposed to be you

4721.29 --> 4725.31
don't start out extreme speeds no you go

4723.3 --> 4728.85
up rather slow and build up speed

4725.31 --> 4730.59
it's never gonna heat up with those slow

4728.85 --> 4732.780000000001
speeds for it's just the friction and as

4730.59 --> 4734.88
she was supposed to go up up up more up

4732.78 --> 4736.32
there's going to be less friction so as

4734.88 --> 4738.6900000000005
you build speed there's going to be less

4736.32 --> 4740.61
friction so there's not gonna be

4738.69 --> 4742.94
anything heating up it's just not how it

4740.61 --> 4742.94
works

4752.199 --> 4759.178999999999
only when slowing down when coming back

4755.489 --> 4761.709999999999
yeah I guess it's the re-entry process

4759.179 --> 4764.65
supposedly and that's when the heat set

4761.71 --> 4768.58
in so that's just how it works

4764.65 --> 4773.28
officially that's how it did they put it

4768.58 --> 4773.28
down in the series that's the story

4781.36 --> 4786.429999999999
if you want to know more about then

4783.16 --> 4789.4
you'll have to dig it dig it out you got

4786.43 --> 4792.070000000001
how that original story was established

4789.4 --> 4794.53
where that came from how it was set and

4792.07 --> 4797.08
then accepted you have to trace it back

4794.53 --> 4802.259999999999
I don't know exactly where it started

4797.08 --> 4806.62
that concept for the heat on reentry

4802.26 --> 4809.530000000001
concept probably even before about

4806.62 --> 4814.54
Apollo it when they started out supposed

4809.53 --> 4816.19
to entry re-entry experiments with

4814.54 --> 4819.03
rockets I guess that's probably when

4816.19 --> 4819.03
they came up with it

4849.969 --> 4860.2300000000005
with pieces of plastic milk crate on

4853.63 --> 4863.41
space action rockets what what milk

4860.23 --> 4867.629999999999
crates really I haven't looked too

4863.41 --> 4867.63
closely that sounds weird man

4925.03 --> 4930.55
well if if you really think that I'm the

4928.15 --> 4932.44
SpaceX launch that was like a part of a

4930.55 --> 4934.2300000000005
milk crate or something you're gonna

4932.44 --> 4938.049999999999
point that out to me I didn't see that

4934.23 --> 4944.08
so yeah maybe bring it up in Skype or

4938.05 --> 4946.29
something or link to it in chat if you

4944.08 --> 4946.29
can

4966.03 --> 4971.67
guys I think I'm gonna round out to show

4968.67 --> 4981.55
been going for 82 minutes already and

4971.67 --> 4983.71
I'm getting kind of hungry talked a lot

4981.55 --> 4985.83
of flat earth the space rockets and

4983.71 --> 4988.66
issues and yeah

4985.83 --> 4990.97
professor Phil Bell got himself been by

4988.66 --> 4992.41
doubling down on the ridiculous fantasy

4990.97 --> 4996.85
that doesn't even support his own

4992.41 --> 5001.29
religion that was anyway disappointing

4996.85 --> 5004.35
I guess that his act of being a

5001.29 --> 5008.46
professor just did not was not up to

5004.35 --> 5012.360000000001
date with the actual research that's

5008.46 --> 5014.37
supposed to back that all that was a bit

5012.36 --> 5016.139999999999
disappointing to me but yeah it's just

5014.37 --> 5017.88
sick of it you know I'll probably unban

5016.14 --> 5019.71
him at some point again and let him try

5017.88 --> 5021.39
another nonsense thing but that is

5019.71 --> 5024.18
really what he has he's just acting like

5021.39 --> 5027.0
he's this professor and like I am

5024.18 --> 5030.6
teacher almond slimes teacher and I'm

5027.0 --> 5033.15
gonna be supervised to make sure they

5030.6 --> 5035.31
get all the details rights and then I'll

5033.15 --> 5040.11
just start making claims making claims

5035.31 --> 5044.04
and then people point me that I well

5040.11 --> 5046.7699999999995
kind of made something up then I'll just

5044.04 --> 5049.89
say no you just don't understand rocket

5046.77 --> 5055.14
science yeah leave it to the smarter

5049.89 --> 5057.87
people and well I'll just start at

5055.14 --> 5060.54
harming you because that's what

5057.87 --> 5062.43
professors do when they got caught in a

5060.54 --> 5065.7
little fantasy when they're actually

5062.43 --> 5071.700000000001
supposed to uphold the knowledge that

5065.7 --> 5072.33
they've learned mmm okay I don't know

5071.7 --> 5074.45
where that went

5072.33 --> 5074.45
but

5079.03 --> 5086.768999999999
sounded a little bit more like a like a

5083.65 --> 5088.449
Kennedy speech yes I don't know how

5086.769 --> 5091.979
professor Phil bell sounds he probably

5088.449 --> 5091.978999999999
sounds a lot more British than that

5093.17 --> 5096.26
[Music]

5096.989 --> 5104.199
finish off the Chile finish it off dude

5100.269 --> 5107.619000000001
that's like half a week's food it's like

5104.199 --> 5112.539
a a pan pan this big that deep and it's

5107.619 --> 5119.339999999999
just boom pure concentrated organic food

5112.539 --> 5121.9
I can't eat that all in in 24 hours man

5119.34 --> 5130.659000000001
that it's gonna take me at least three

5121.9 --> 5134.888999999999
three more days and that's good you did

5130.659 --> 5138.039
mark colored it's the it's kind of like

5134.889 --> 5142.3
the it's kind of boom boomer glory you

5138.039 --> 5146.739
know it's I get it it's like Professor

5142.3 --> 5151.3
professor Kennedy you know Kennedy the

5146.739 --> 5154.53
president from the sixties the way he

5151.3 --> 5158.139
talked always being very impressive and

5154.53 --> 5164.559
being very serious yet also daring to

5158.139 --> 5167.53
point at the flaws just be worthy and I

5164.559 --> 5170.829000000001
bet the boomers loved every second of

5167.53 --> 5174.4
everything he said because it does help

5170.829 --> 5177.19
them get into this glorious dream state

5174.4 --> 5180.21
where it is all fantastical it does help

5177.19 --> 5183.638999999999
that that way that he talked doesn't it

5180.21 --> 5186.329
didn't it absolutely feel feed the

5183.639 --> 5186.329
Boomer spell

5192.909 --> 5202.36
hmm I'm glad you liked it more call it I

5196.27 --> 5204.52
was just improvising we go to the moon

5202.36 --> 5215.07
we go to the moon not because it is easy

5204.52 --> 5215.070000000001
but because we can fake it that's hard

5215.76 --> 5220.75
how funny is that really when he said

5218.53 --> 5223.389
that so serious but just look at it from

5220.75 --> 5231.51
another context we go to the moon not

5223.389 --> 5235.54
because it's easy because it's hard like

5231.51 --> 5237.88
we are going insane not because it's

5235.54 --> 5241.3
easy because we have to

5237.88 --> 5247.08
it's tough we have to do this isn't it

5241.3 --> 5247.08
in a way it's the spell the Boomer spell

5264.469 --> 5269.54
see at the debates there is no life

5267.92 --> 5274.66
latter of debates right you know that

5269.54 --> 5278.3
it's just a rerun or a it's a premiere

5274.66 --> 5280.43
the after show from yesterday I think it

5278.3 --> 5282.59
was still cool I'm gonna watch it it

5280.43 --> 5285.04
should be going for 25 minutes already

5282.59 --> 5288.53
I'm not sure I haven't checked up but I

5285.04 --> 5290.84
was gonna round out the show now so I'm

5288.53 --> 5294.38
just gonna do that have some lunch and

5290.84 --> 5298.01
oh yeah not to forget this evening

5294.38 --> 5300.89
another live ball busters it's gonna be

5378.89 --> 5387.5
oh hello Samhain how much do I need for

5384.08 --> 5389.449
the air filter wolf I it's kind of

5387.5 --> 5392.15
complicated it's like the device I used

5389.449 --> 5395.239
to have this thing actually cost me like

5392.15 --> 5397.48
400 euros back in the day but I don't

5395.239 --> 5399.16
even know if it is still in production

5397.48 --> 5401.739
and there's so many air filters are all

5399.16 --> 5406.78
over the place but yeah it's gotta be

5401.739 --> 5409.15
expensive for sure so I think for 400

5406.78 --> 5412.87
euros I could probably get exactly the

5409.15 --> 5415.33
same system it the problem is it hasn't

5412.87 --> 5419.23
really cheapened down over the years I

5415.33 --> 5421.78
did take a look because I don't know the

5419.23 --> 5423.099999999999
parts are just expensive to build or

5421.78 --> 5424.9
something I don't know exactly it's a

5423.1 --> 5427.3
different weird type of market where I

5424.9 --> 5429.549999999999
got it from it used to come from network

5427.3 --> 5431.320000000001
marketing and it died down a little but

5429.55 --> 5435.91
it's still a good system I used to sell

5431.32 --> 5438.5199999999995
them it's a very good one they're very

5435.91 --> 5442.389999999999
good and these things have been very

5438.52 --> 5445.030000000001
good way before any advanced air

5442.39 --> 5447.51
filtration system have hit the general

5445.03 --> 5456.0
market was way before that

5447.51 --> 5460.71
but anyway blow air through it what

5456.0 --> 5463.51
whatever so I don't know exactly how

5460.71 --> 5468.22
expensive but probably a couple of

5463.51 --> 5471.37
hundred euros anyway yeah continue to

5468.22 --> 5475.150000000001
