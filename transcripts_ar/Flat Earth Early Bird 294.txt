59.91 --> 64.14
channel through the paypal patreon my

61.89 --> 66.45
GoFundMe and the super chat if there's

64.14 --> 70.43900000000001
no other way that would be much

66.45 --> 74.34
appreciated so today the weather is

70.439 --> 79.64999999999999
quite different as you can see wearing

74.34 --> 85.979
sweater it's so it's much fresher not

79.65 --> 88.759
windy not very warm and has been raining

85.979 --> 94.77
a little here in there as well but

88.759 --> 97.159
serious it's just yeah but I kind of

94.77 --> 97.15899999999999
like it

99.39 --> 107.73
this way the heat doesn't bog me down as

102.15 --> 110.19
much I can stay more on on a quicker

107.73 --> 112.14
pace more easily this way anyway I got

110.19 --> 124.77
to Mara coffee with me today and just

112.14 --> 125.49
tea that's it alright so yesterday stuff

124.77 --> 134.34
happened

125.49 --> 137.51999999999998
I was on Jose's again I think there was

134.34 --> 141.15
just so much hangout stuff going on

137.52 --> 145.20000000000002
yesterday stopped stayed up until very

141.15 --> 146.28
late again unfortunately but yeah it was

145.2 --> 150.45
just so funny

146.28 --> 155.55
grantees grantees hang out with the

150.45 --> 160.5
clown duo rumpus and and Georgia Nettie

155.55 --> 168.63000000000002
nuke it was just and so long they kept

160.5 --> 170.519
on going so long amazing so it was just

168.63 --> 172.59
hilarious seeing them constantly

170.519 --> 174.81
doubling down and gas lighting every

172.59 --> 178.11
especially rumpus when he came in was

174.81 --> 181.35
just like after all that like oh no

178.11 --> 186.45000000000002
they're wrong about everything and it's

181.35 --> 192.959
all qyz fault for helping everyone to

186.45 --> 198.57
understand yeah it was funny so anyway

192.959 --> 203.13
let's see who isn't Chad hm

226.23 --> 233.67999999999998
Cosentino sorry that I didn't keep him

229.72 --> 234.66
doing that are you where he or she by

233.68 --> 242.23000000000002
the way

234.66 --> 246.55
Sarita I would take from the a that you

242.23 --> 250.81
are a she as it seems a very Latino

246.55 --> 254.17000000000002
oriented name on the other hand

250.81 --> 258.37
Constantino is a male name but since

254.17 --> 260.89
it's a last name I don't know I keep on

258.37 --> 266.56
mixing it up annoying that bandsaw

260.89 --> 269.4
Bennett matrix media flat out faith yeah

266.56 --> 269.4
good to see you all

270.9 --> 273.98999999999995
[Music]

276.249 --> 278.879
yeah

283.53 --> 295.38899999999995
unicorn laser eyes I do so what will the

291.669 --> 297.06899999999996
subjects be today that to be fair you

295.389 --> 301.53000000000003
just kind of like yesterday I've been

297.069 --> 301.53000000000003
all over the place in my head in D&D oh

302.43 --> 310.63
and Benjamin movies it's kind of all

307.449 --> 312.88
over the place I got a little tiny ideas

310.63 --> 315.61
with everything but it's not really

312.88 --> 318.31
noteworthy and I'll probably just really

315.61 --> 330.09000000000003
remember that once it does become

318.31 --> 330.09
relevant in some way so oh yeah there's

332.15 --> 337.60999999999996
me my dad are kind of like fooling

335.449 --> 339.83000000000004
around now with Bitcoin which I've

337.61 --> 343.19
started to engage I have no idea yet

339.83 --> 348.71
what comes out of it I don't yet have

343.19 --> 350.9
any trust that yeah you see every time

348.71 --> 352.84999999999997
you engage in some kind of new system

350.9 --> 356.229
there's always the question every time

352.85 --> 358.79
for me even though I do trust this

356.229 --> 361.31
organization out because they've went

358.79 --> 363.8
through a lot and they did always fix

361.31 --> 367.04
things but every time it's always like

363.8 --> 369.41
okay you're really good it has to be

367.04 --> 371.72
proven first that it's actually real and

369.41 --> 373.43
not actually a black hole where it turns

371.72 --> 378.74
out that you can get your money out

373.43 --> 381.979
eventually because way before this there

378.74 --> 383.93
were well a lot of those things around I

381.979 --> 387.44
think they're probably still are maybe

383.93 --> 389.93
they crack down a little on it and so

387.44 --> 395.09
yeah you're always on your toes every

389.93 --> 401.63
time you try something new but anyway at

395.09 --> 405.08
least it can be used as a money transfer

401.63 --> 408.919
medium and that is really what that is

405.08 --> 410.84
all about it is not about okay you just

408.919 --> 415.669
try to figure it out with with

410.84 --> 419.0
cryptocurrency or whatever no it can be

415.669 --> 423.79999999999995
used as a as a money transferring medium

419.0 --> 426.88
and that's good that but I've got to

423.8 --> 432.08
test that first I first got to see it

426.88 --> 434.479
got the cash to believe it so I don't

432.08 --> 438.40999999999997
know for me it is kind of exciting

434.479 --> 445.4
although I'm not gonna drown myself into

438.41 --> 447.78900000000004
that but yeah it was about time that was

445.4 --> 447.789
gonna happen

449.939 --> 455.499
and who knows maybe some of you are also

452.849 --> 457.319
fooling around with this stuff and well

455.499 --> 459.43
at some point I'll probably be

457.319 --> 461.11
contacting you in the background and

459.43 --> 464.56
just having talks about like what do you

461.11 --> 466.689
do what do you think are good methods

464.56 --> 469.06
good sources all that but I'm not ready

466.689 --> 470.11
for that just yet I first need to learn

469.06 --> 475.18
the basics

470.11 --> 477.96000000000004
and kinda get a feel for the the default

475.18 --> 490.96
area as it were what I'm dealing with

477.96 --> 495.69899999999996
so anyway that's going on mind-warped on

490.96 --> 498.909
yeah sure but I'll start I'll start

495.699 --> 503.139
considering talking about it once I

498.909 --> 507.729
really have some yeah some practical

503.139 --> 510.009
based information because everything so

507.729 --> 511.96
far is purely theoretical from what I

510.009 --> 515.88
snatched around and compared to people

511.96 --> 520.51
that I thought seemed kind of

515.88 --> 522.37
understanding about it and since none of

520.51 --> 525.01
all those stories seem to differ too

522.37 --> 529.24
much there seems to be a consistency at

525.01 --> 531.1
what bitcoin is from many angles so but

529.24 --> 532.57
that's all secondhand information I got

531.1 --> 537.01
to do it myself first before I could

532.57 --> 540.1
become comfortable about yeah really

537.01 --> 543.25
giving more in-depth data because I bet

540.1 --> 545.32
people or some of you might be working

543.25 --> 551.769
on that for years and they've got a

545.32 --> 554.0790000000001
really deep understanding now but I'm

551.769 --> 556.089
not ready to handle that level of

554.079 --> 560.05
information that'll just pressure me too

556.089 --> 562.649
much at this point but I will be ready I

560.05 --> 562.649
will be

567.86 --> 577.44
what I have no idea what you're talking

573.18 --> 581.519
about Lottie oh hey by the way Adam

577.44 --> 586.7090000000001
Aiken I need to talk to you are you free

581.519 --> 591.329
tonight a Tuesday sure sure what do you

586.709 --> 593.88
want to talk about you just talk to me

591.329 --> 594.3
over Skype if it if you want to keep it

593.88 --> 600.57
private

594.3 --> 602.0999999999999
I I do check up on my skype a lot so to

600.57 --> 604.8900000000001
me Skype is more like an interactive

602.1 --> 611.0400000000001
email system to me alright about

604.89 --> 615.36
Amsterdam oh okay cool yeah I'll be

611.04 --> 619.38
there on Saturday I have no idea what

615.36 --> 621.66
what it's gonna be like I'm having low

619.38 --> 623.1899999999999
expectations at this but that's for me

621.66 --> 625.4399999999999
personally I'm not saying you're the

623.19 --> 628.2900000000001
events not gonna be good but I'm not

625.44 --> 630.48
gonna give some kind of expectation like

628.29 --> 633.6899999999999
I'm gonna be received like some kind of

630.48 --> 636.57
celebrity or something with the first

633.69 --> 640.23
show because look I'm just a guy I have

636.57 --> 643.2900000000001
ideas and people have a lot of mixed

640.23 --> 647.82
feelings about me that's not just trolls

643.29 --> 650.79
so you're still bunking up with me at

647.82 --> 652.7700000000001
what right

650.79 --> 656.16
yeah I'm not staying there in Amsterdam

652.77 --> 658.4399999999999
by the way when I'm down there I'll be

656.16 --> 660.209
go yeah I might be going out with some

658.44 --> 662.61
people and then when I'm done with that

660.209 --> 666.649
I'll just be going back on the train to

662.61 --> 666.649
to Utrecht so

667.17 --> 676.99
that's good look Nicole Garland look

673.53 --> 678.85
look at the description box look at the

676.99 --> 682.47
first sentence you don't even need to

678.85 --> 686.44
click show more it's right there

682.47 --> 689.28
it has been since pretty much the first

686.44 --> 693.97
early bird show I think so

689.28 --> 696.61
it's right there and it's not our win 7

693.97 --> 703.99
with IJ that's wrong it's with a why

696.61 --> 707.53
it's very specific the original are wins

703.99 --> 711.4300000000001
were either taken or ruined they got

707.53 --> 713.5899999999999
broken it's not reliable anymore so this

711.43 --> 723.66
is the Skype account that I got that I

713.59 --> 723.6600000000001
use right

724.63 --> 736.1
it's going fracking no God no no Bitcoin

731.48 --> 742.4300000000001
should actually just be abandoned at

736.1 --> 746.26
some point to make a Bitcoin to the

742.43 --> 748.9399999999999
super more efficient version that yeah

746.26 --> 755.06
the cryptocurrency is all gonna be about

748.94 --> 757.0100000000001
energy efficiency not all of it but it's

755.06 --> 761.03
going to be cyclical and it's going to

757.01 --> 763.55
be about energy efficiency and I bet you

761.03 --> 765.9499999999999
that eventually when everybody's using

763.55 --> 767.9599999999999
that if it ever will completely go to

765.95 --> 772.0300000000001
that as a standard there will probably

767.96 --> 774.35
always be cash but just not as much and

772.03 --> 776.54
if things are more standardized

774.35 --> 778.4
surrounding cryptocurrency then there's

776.54 --> 780.14
going to be rules about it concerning

778.4 --> 783.53
the amount of energy consumption that

780.14 --> 786.29
they use so then it those systems will

783.53 --> 788.36
become cyclical they'll have a

786.29 --> 790.31
cryptocurrency boosting up growing like

788.36 --> 792.14
a plant and then at some point okay now

790.31 --> 794.78
it's just becoming too energy

792.14 --> 798.23
inefficient so it's going to be shut

794.78 --> 800.66
down and well if it's properly guided

798.23 --> 803.0500000000001
there's going to be the new one the

800.66 --> 808.3
seeds already in preparation to

803.05 --> 808.3
basically allow a transfer

812.2 --> 819.7
and that's how it keeps on going it's

814.87 --> 823.139
like digital crop growing and then one

819.7 --> 826.45
the plant just full-grown yeah you just

823.139 --> 832.51
stop using that and switch to the new

826.45 --> 836.019
one so that's what I think the little

832.51 --> 837.699
it's a possibility that it's a possible

836.019 --> 843.579
balance I don't know how long it will

837.699 --> 850.06
last but that could at least for awhile

843.579 --> 852.4899999999999
be sufficient but yeah if Bitcoin or

850.06 --> 855.25
Bitcoin for it's the prime most example

852.49 --> 858.25
of this of non energy efficient of one

855.25 --> 859.99
of the first if it is allowed to just

858.25 --> 863.199
keep on growing and growing and growing

859.99 --> 866.8
then eventually like every micro

863.199 --> 869.459
fraction of a coin being harvest it's

866.8 --> 873.75
just gonna cost so much freakin energy

869.459 --> 873.75
who's willing to pay the bill for that

877.41 --> 883.829
you gotta be at some point it will

880.949 --> 887.039
irreversibly become almost a bubble as

883.829 --> 891.569
well because of that probably but who

887.039 --> 893.729
knows if some crazy mega scam would be

891.569 --> 895.829
built in an entire country puts its

893.729 --> 897.629
entire reserve behind it then it could

895.829 --> 899.2489999999999
potentially be pumped up forever but

897.629 --> 902.729
it's gonna cost so much energies because

899.249 --> 905.5790000000001
good that's gonna reef havoc so it would

902.729 --> 911.4490000000001
be crazy not to put some rules on energy

905.579 --> 911.449
limitations in crypto mining anyway

922.54 --> 933.79
well good for you Trish Blythe look yeah

925.93 --> 935.8889999999999
Bitcoin was it it yeah as a newcomer

933.79 --> 942.269
that's the thing it was a pretty

935.889 --> 945.399
successful you know for a currency and

942.269 --> 950.079
there is a lot of faith in the system as

945.399 --> 954.22
an alternative for many reasons many

950.079 --> 956.079
options because of the options form from

954.22 --> 959.7090000000001
many different angles and that's it's

956.079 --> 964.959
just like it's summoned into being just

959.709 --> 967.0189999999999
for this time and yeah I don't blame

964.959 --> 969.6099999999999
people for having invested in this in

967.019 --> 975.339
Bitcoin and they probably did make a lot

969.61 --> 978.5500000000001
of profit and of course in retrospect I

975.339 --> 980.9200000000001
wish I would have but I didn't know

978.55 --> 983.56
anyone that was it that knew anything

980.92 --> 986.2199999999999
about that it was yeah

983.56 --> 990.13
very new technology and I am kind of

986.22 --> 993.3000000000001
technophobic and very new things make it

990.13 --> 993.3
makes me nervous

1009.74 --> 1017.639
right all the coins and the coins and

1012.449 --> 1023.67
the coins whatever it's gonna do right

1017.639 --> 1025.98
but look I don't even know how all these

1023.67 --> 1031.649
coins everywhere can just be spawning

1025.98 --> 1034.079
and be doing things it I don't know

1031.649 --> 1036.149
maybe I don't know if all those options

1034.079 --> 1042.36
if that freedom is always going to be

1036.149 --> 1049.1299999999999
there it would be very interesting if it

1042.36 --> 1049.1299999999999
would coriolis coin

1058.94 --> 1065.96
right well Trish life I did actually

1062.42 --> 1072.5
invest in silver at the time made a huge

1065.96 --> 1074.3600000000001
loss of it although before that I

1072.5 --> 1076.52
invested in gold and kind of make a

1074.36 --> 1086.8999999999999
problematic profit in it so it kind of

1076.52 --> 1089.6
squared out so it's tricky when when

1086.9 --> 1091.91
you're stacking metals that only really

1089.6 --> 1097.73
works purely when you have them as a

1091.91 --> 1100.01
reserve if you're gonna treat it as

1097.73 --> 1101.3600000000001
fluid financially then it's probably

1100.01 --> 1104.78
going to turn out to be a waste of

1101.36 --> 1107.05
investment you know it's really just for

1104.78 --> 1107.05
stacking

1111.16 --> 1118.93
that's my experience with it because a

1114.75 --> 1122.14
to invest in gold and silver coins was

1118.93 --> 1125.8200000000002
also part of the reason why I even chose

1122.14 --> 1130.24
to become a goldsmith professionally

1125.82 --> 1135.1
because it had the tax advantages for

1130.24 --> 1138.94
that it's very convenient to me and that

1135.1 --> 1145.8999999999999
is also kind of like how I made yeah a

1138.94 --> 1148.81
background profit but I just yeah just

1145.9 --> 1152.44
kept it stacking that's it

1148.81 --> 1152.44
[Music]

1153.42 --> 1162.3300000000002
tell your auntie anyway I don't have any

1157.72 --> 1165.73
any of that anymore so yeah Arwen wins

1162.33 --> 1167.97
temporary golden age' has been over for

1165.73 --> 1167.97
a while

1173.86 --> 1186.85
and in retrospect I probably should have

1176.74 --> 1186.85
invested in something more long run yeah

1191.2 --> 1195.23
right you know a secret

1192.98 --> 1198.71
Asian man that the weird thing is that

1195.23 --> 1201.559
idea collapses money is irrelevant

1198.71 --> 1206.1200000000001
that was also going through my head a

1201.559 --> 1210.3999999999999
lot back then when I actually had the

1206.12 --> 1210.3999999999999
money and it didn't really help at all

1210.91 --> 1221.0
it actually made me afraid to sit on it

1216.23 --> 1224.72
and just save it up so that entire idea

1221.0 --> 1228.679
is not really helpful at all it's also

1224.72 --> 1231.95
one of the kind of in retrospect fear

1228.679 --> 1234.44
porn angles so what Alex Jones is

1231.95 --> 1236.8400000000001
constantly do it has been doing and he

1234.44 --> 1240.5
tied it in with relevant things and then

1236.84 --> 1241.85
kind of like who are they gonna do

1240.5 --> 1243.92
anything now are they gonna do anything

1241.85 --> 1247.25
now and and tie things and together when

1243.92 --> 1250.03
something did happen but yeah do

1247.25 --> 1254.12
anything financial collapse you have to

1250.03 --> 1259.46
buy a lot of things that you can stack

1254.12 --> 1263.9289999999999
up prepping and a I'm not even against

1259.46 --> 1266.24
prepping especially if you can it's not

1263.929 --> 1272.92
a bad investment if you have the room

1266.24 --> 1277.059
for it financially but if you don't then

1272.92 --> 1277.059
it's kind of yeah

1277.99 --> 1282.36
I don't know I tried to stack things

1282.39 --> 1288.3990000000001
that are very durable in the long run

1285.429 --> 1292.419
that you need very little of but you

1288.399 --> 1294.6399999999999
will need it very hard when you need it

1292.419 --> 1301.5700000000002
that's the type of things I do try to

1294.64 --> 1306.96
stack up mostly and the rest is just try

1301.57 --> 1306.96
to stay afloat that's it for now

1321.54 --> 1324.589
[Music]

1328.07 --> 1330.639
right

1342.8 --> 1344.83
Oh

1350.95 --> 1359.8300000000002
all right well Trish just consider this

1355.869 --> 1364.09
okay if something really goes wrong and

1359.83 --> 1365.71
places go to chaos like big cities yeah

1364.09 --> 1370.619
what do you think your bid going is

1365.71 --> 1379.769
gonna be worth when the power goes down

1370.619 --> 1383.889
for example okay just just thinking know

1379.769 --> 1388.6
what what do you do then so if

1383.889 --> 1392.2299999999998
everything breaks down if it really does

1388.6 --> 1393.759
that then cryptocurrency is not gonna be

1392.23 --> 1398.08
worth a lot because cryptocurrency

1393.759 --> 1400.659
really requires society to be up to this

1398.08 --> 1409.149
level of stable in order to even do

1400.659 --> 1411.7
anything I'm just saying if you don't

1409.149 --> 1413.9699999999998
have power then you can't use it it's

1411.7 --> 1413.97
worthless

1415.909 --> 1424.659
and yeah you could go with your with

1420.049 --> 1427.309
your stored us be filled with crypto

1424.659 --> 1430.0390000000002
information personalized scripted

1427.309 --> 1432.289
information and then go to a place where

1430.039 --> 1435.379
there is electricity and then apply it

1432.289 --> 1438.919
again but there would have to be these

1435.379 --> 1442.759
places and if those places are scarce

1438.919 --> 1445.789
it's very likely they're gonna yeah

1442.759 --> 1448.669
demand huge tolls in order for you to

1445.789 --> 1450.559
use that so they're gonna take most of

1448.669 --> 1456.6490000000001
your cryptocurrency if you have that

1450.559 --> 1458.359
anyway they'll probably give more for

1456.649 --> 1461.7189999999998
actual things like gold and silver at

1458.359 --> 1463.759
that point because it's physical it

1461.719 --> 1465.709
doesn't really depend on electricity so

1463.759 --> 1469.839
it could be used much more widespread so

1465.709 --> 1469.8390000000002
anyway that's just you know

1477.919 --> 1482.2990000000002
okay all right

1482.539 --> 1488.24
that was a troll obviously

1493.22 --> 1501.29
yeah yeah no I'm not going off in a rant

1497.03 --> 1505.28
against you it's just that you said

1501.29 --> 1509.6299999999999
Bitcoin is so awesome and all these

1505.28 --> 1513.29
things happening and Bitcoin is safe but

1509.63 --> 1515.45
before you were talking about how when

1513.29 --> 1518.29
everything is in trouble I'm just saying

1515.45 --> 1521.15
like yeah okay when there's some turmoil

1518.29 --> 1523.1299999999999
the markets can go a lot up and down

1521.15 --> 1525.14
depending on the situation and then

1523.13 --> 1527.45
Bitcoin or whatever would be relatively

1525.14 --> 1532.8200000000002
safe but when the [ __ ] actually hits

1527.45 --> 1534.5900000000001
your your region badly then it's not

1532.82 --> 1536.9299999999998
gonna do it I was just generally

1534.59 --> 1544.76
expecting not not criticizing you don't

1536.93 --> 1549.89
don't worry come on don't get all

1544.76 --> 1552.02
triggered yeah you got it right I

1549.89 --> 1554.0900000000001
understand you got the silver I'm not

1552.02 --> 1556.48
criticizing you I'm talking in general

1554.09 --> 1556.48
sheesh

1566.42 --> 1580.46
all right anyway the coriolis confusion

1576.65 --> 1581.0
spell rages on powers on then so it

1580.46 --> 1582.89
seems

1581.0 --> 1584.81
or there is Coriolis effect and there is

1582.89 --> 1587.15
no Coriolis effect at the same time

1584.81 --> 1589.55
because there is Coriolis effect because

1587.15 --> 1592.8500000000001
when there is Coriolis effect everything

1589.55 --> 1596.23
moves and another reference frame to the

1592.85 --> 1599.8
earth causing that Coriolis effect but

1596.23 --> 1602.3
when we look up everything is actually

1599.8 --> 1604.49
stationary in relation to the earth with

1602.3 --> 1607.85
the reference frame so there should be

1604.49 --> 1612.26
no Coriolis effect but there is because

1607.85 --> 1614.27
there has to be so that's why they keep

1612.26 --> 1616.28
on forwarding both these stories and

1614.27 --> 1620.15
constantly mixing them up at their

1616.28 --> 1623.6299999999999
convenience like two conflicting

1620.15 --> 1625.52
arguments they both use even though it

1623.63 --> 1629.18
doesn't actually make sense when you do

1625.52 --> 1634.0
that that's what's probably going to be

1629.18 --> 1634.0
continuing happening for a long time

1651.59 --> 1657.34
right well Dave Johnson Grady yeah if

1655.669 --> 1660.169
you want to invest in Amazon that's

1657.34 --> 1662.6
that's great just know that they

1660.169 --> 1668.679
practically apply slave labor wherever

1662.6 --> 1672.049
they can even in Western countries so

1668.679 --> 1677.72
you're basically every time you invest

1672.049 --> 1679.49
you're squeezing more workers you're

1677.72 --> 1684.1390000000001
squeezing the life out of them when you

1679.49 --> 1686.09
do that do you realize this well if

1684.139 --> 1689.86
you'd invest in something that's less

1686.09 --> 1695.269
aggressive to their own workforce and

1689.86 --> 1698.029
and let's focus on just profits then you

1695.269 --> 1701.919
actually be helping to create working

1698.029 --> 1705.83
room for people to have decent lives and

1701.919 --> 1707.929
not be all groggy and better again

1705.83 --> 1714.08
Society for forcing them into a

1707.929 --> 1717.15
fucked-up job you know I'm just saying

1714.08 --> 1720.24
maybe this is

1717.15 --> 1722.3100000000002
it's blasphemy to the to the money

1720.24 --> 1725.16
lovers like how dare you invest

1722.31 --> 1726.6299999999999
something that's not maximum profit well

1725.16 --> 1729.5700000000002
I don't know I'm just trying to think

1726.63 --> 1737.0100000000002
about what you could actually do another

1729.57 --> 1744.6299999999999
priority just saying support smaller

1737.01 --> 1746.64
shops perhaps it could also be just if

1744.63 --> 1749.1000000000001
there are smaller shops like how are

1746.64 --> 1752.22
they actually doing you could just be a

1749.1 --> 1755.1
customer there keep on buying stuff but

1752.22 --> 1758.18
you could also perhaps help them out see

1755.1 --> 1758.1799999999998
how they were doing

1759.65 --> 1768.66
maybe maybe help them out with tips if

1766.08 --> 1770.73
you got a lot of insight in certain

1768.66 --> 1775.68
regions that they obviously don't you

1770.73 --> 1777.69
know that's also where that's

1775.68 --> 1780.18
intellectual investment in small

1777.69 --> 1782.25
companies and hey if you're a small

1780.18 --> 1789.66
company especially one when companies

1782.25 --> 1794.06
they have to do a lot so they usually

1789.66 --> 1794.0600000000002
thrive on honest good advice

1800.25 --> 1805.45
unfortunately or when someone has to do

1803.2 --> 1811.27
those [ __ ] up jobs yeah because people

1805.45 --> 1813.04
are greedy as [ __ ] so the only jobs

1811.27 --> 1815.53
eventually left because of all the

1813.04 --> 1818.94
investment are those [ __ ] up jobs and

1815.53 --> 1818.94
then what do you do

1829.52 --> 1841.059
wasn't for handling the pasta hmm really

1835.539 --> 1844.52
well Trish Blythe I think the Amazon

1841.059 --> 1847.0
they did I guess they do still use post

1844.52 --> 1850.1
offices but they also have their own

1847.0 --> 1853.64
delivery drone programs stuff even I've

1850.1 --> 1855.799
seen so it's not gonna be long before

1853.64 --> 1859.01
the post office is just going to be out

1855.799 --> 1862.22
sourced by themselves they're a very

1859.01 --> 1865.48
imperial company and they squeeze

1862.22 --> 1865.48
everything they touch

1870.13 --> 1877.7990000000002
my myself to be honest try to avoid the

1875.38 --> 1881.74
entire company as much as I can

1877.799 --> 1883.75
and I've tried out some functions just

1881.74 --> 1887.2
look what it's like I considered using

1883.75 --> 1890.289
Amazon publishing but never really went

1887.2 --> 1892.299
through with it it was it was like a

1890.289 --> 1894.97
tryout thing anyway it's not wasn't

1892.299 --> 1896.98
gonna do a lot concerning attention and

1894.97 --> 1902.3500000000001
Dragons campaign thing that I made

1896.98 --> 1905.35
prefab but it wasn't it wasn't properly

1902.35 --> 1907.84
designed as in using the layouts and

1905.35 --> 1913.059
everything I just was kind of stumbling

1907.84 --> 1915.49
as I want to make it whatever but other

1913.059 --> 1917.76
than that now I rarely use Amazon for

1915.49 --> 1917.76
anything

1928.67 --> 1937.309
spring onions yeah I'm wash dishes

1931.309 --> 1941.66
indeed even clean toilets well maybe it

1937.309 --> 1945.799
would surprise you that if I told you

1941.66 --> 1948.95
that well except for the spring onions I

1945.799 --> 1953.809
yeah I did all those types of jobs at

1948.95 --> 1957.98
one point or another especially when I

1953.809 --> 1960.35
was a lot younger I was at for a period

1957.98 --> 1968.96
of professional dishwasher and I'm very

1960.35 --> 1975.9499999999998
good at it but doesn't really get you

1968.96 --> 1978.38
anywhere and if they have yeah just bad

1975.95 --> 1982.46
types of soap it really sucks for your

1978.38 --> 1991.22
hands eventually you don't really get to

1982.46 --> 1993.919
choose what soap you use so yeah Trish

1991.22 --> 1995.9
Blythe I know in the I know there's much

1993.919 --> 2001.72
more things than just Amazon I didn't

1995.9 --> 2003.1000000000001
really know too much back then so if I'm

2001.72 --> 2004.69
never gonna publish something is

2003.1 --> 2007.27
probably not gonna be through Amazon and

2004.69 --> 2011.52
I'm probably gonna have somebody

2007.27 --> 2016.57
advising me on it that's a lot wiser

2011.52 --> 2019.74
then the advice then peoples that I had

2016.57 --> 2019.74
for advice back then

2023.74 --> 2029.13
all right I know sometimes work is work

2026.77 --> 2029.1299999999999
I know

2041.66 --> 2048.7400000000002
all right and then saw banded that's

2046.19 --> 2050.6
exactly how I see my newspaper rounds

2048.74 --> 2054.5899999999997
that so many trolls like to laugh about

2050.6 --> 2058.04
so much I think it's so hysterical but

2054.59 --> 2061.3700000000003
yeah I do it because literally nobody

2058.04 --> 2063.5
wants to do it and the age category that

2061.37 --> 2065.3599999999997
it's normally aimed at they have better

2063.5 --> 2069.32
things to waste their time on because it

2065.36 --> 2072.1690000000003
doesn't make any money and it's the

2069.32 --> 2073.96
Netherlands so it's not the best type of

2072.169 --> 2079.5499999999997
weather region to do that kind of thing

2073.96 --> 2082.37
at it it would have been this summer so

2079.55 --> 2083.389
I just do it because the people are very

2082.37 --> 2089.33
happy about it

2083.389 --> 2091.4500000000003
they really are and I don't mind doing

2089.33 --> 2091.45
it

2095.74 --> 2103.9599999999996
so yeah work is work but you can do work

2100.05 --> 2108.28
just to try to grab a lot of money or

2103.96 --> 2112.5
you can do work because it needs to be

2108.28 --> 2115.96
done same way pretty much every time I

2112.5 --> 2118.03
visit some kind of park or garden or

2115.96 --> 2120.849
whatever and there's junk around I'll be

2118.03 --> 2125.94
very inclined to pick that up and put it

2120.849 --> 2125.94
in the nearest trash can I just do that

2126.57 --> 2136.77
that feels really good afterward so yeah

2132.58 --> 2136.77
and I do it because it needs to be done

2138.119 --> 2142.7200000000003
but yeah at the same time it will be

2140.859 --> 2147.339
good to have a little bit more money I

2142.72 --> 2149.83
agree so I for some time I am having

2147.339 --> 2152.47
kind of like a plan starting to unfold

2149.83 --> 2156.24
as to a route that I could take and I

2152.47 --> 2156.24
just needed more information about it

2157.17 --> 2164.08
alright mozzarellas mist everyone should

2159.82 --> 2168.9700000000003
do that yet nobody does it instead there

2164.08 --> 2172.089
are actually more people that just

2168.97 --> 2174.5499999999997
choose to dump [ __ ] everywhere without a

2172.089 --> 2179.43
second thought then there are people

2174.55 --> 2184.869
that would pick up junk unfortunately

2179.43 --> 2187.089
but yeah if you don't do it then you

2184.869 --> 2193.17
have to sit in it and realize that you

2187.089 --> 2196.229
didn't do anything about it so yeah

2193.17 --> 2196.2290000000003
[Music]

2199.86 --> 2207.01
it's in a way also claiming a spot as

2204.46 --> 2209.5
yours I guess it's like to me it really

2207.01 --> 2214.48
feels like cleaning up my room like I

2209.5 --> 2218.38
appreciate certain places then I'm gonna

2214.48 --> 2220.9900000000002
be there more often then it feels kind

2218.38 --> 2225.52
of like it's my spots in a way it's my

2220.99 --> 2228.0099999999998
place so I'd want to be in a

2225.52 --> 2230.2
nice-looking place I want a place that I

2228.01 --> 2232.0600000000004
associated with to be nice so I will

2230.2 --> 2234.27
clean it up because I don't want to

2232.06 --> 2241.2599999999998
associate with a place filled with junk

2234.27 --> 2241.2599999999998
that's also my method a Chris Barry

2244.41 --> 2253.2
right lotty says I know that but those

2248.29 --> 2253.2
jobs are not exactly up for grabs at all

2253.44 --> 2258.4900000000002
or you're gonna do it voluntary work and

2256.87 --> 2261.31
then you literally make absolutely

2258.49 --> 2265.0499999999997
nothing of it so no I'll just do it

2261.31 --> 2265.0499999999997
independently I just do it

2275.51 --> 2282.55
I don't know maybe this sounds kind of

2278.36 --> 2286.3700000000003
really stupid and senseless senselessly

2282.55 --> 2291.02
selfless I guess but if I look at the

2286.37 --> 2293.69
people that are like in city cleaning

2291.02 --> 2296.78
and everything the types that they are I

2293.69 --> 2299.9
think that they benefit a lot more from

2296.78 --> 2303.7000000000003
having that job then compared to if they

2299.9 --> 2309.9500000000003
don't comparing me to having a job to

2303.7 --> 2314.23
when they don't I don't think they will

2309.95 --> 2317.33
do very well without it and they're yeah

2314.23 --> 2319.46
the ones that do it are really happy

2317.33 --> 2324.43
with it and are really dedicated so it

2319.46 --> 2328.16
seems every time because it's a good job

2324.43 --> 2332.1499999999996
here over here it's a well-paid job to

2328.16 --> 2335.48
be a garbage man or clean up whatever to

2332.15 --> 2339.8
be part of the county that organizes it

2335.48 --> 2346.67
pays for that although not without its

2339.8 --> 2347.8900000000003
issues that one guy yeah the military oh

2346.67 --> 2353.36
goodie

2347.89 --> 2357.89
yeah that's that's probably not good for

2353.36 --> 2362.09
me but I have considered it although at

2357.89 --> 2366.68
the time when when I had the option as

2362.09 --> 2368.9300000000003
it were I rejected it very much so at

2366.68 --> 2374.93
that time I was not ready at all

2368.93 --> 2378.79
I was a mess at that time too much crazy

2374.93 --> 2378.79
[ __ ] going on but

2382.15 --> 2388.21
I don't know I what the military is

2386.68 --> 2393.3689999999997
especially in the Netherlands I just

2388.21 --> 2395.7690000000002
don't think that would work but I'm I

2393.369 --> 2400.079
don't know it all depends I guess it

2395.769 --> 2403.0589999999997
really depends at this time I wouldn't

2400.079 --> 2404.65
say if everything completely changes

2403.059 --> 2407.079
around and it seems like a sensible

2404.65 --> 2413.5190000000002
thing to do and it would be relatively

2407.079 --> 2413.5190000000002
safe from my perspective then why not

2417.1 --> 2422.25
but yeah at this time no

2426.86 --> 2431.75
right

2428.87 --> 2434.0499999999997
secret Asian man that's right at this

2431.75 --> 2434.05
point

2440.67 --> 2446.579
all right well in in a way though secret

2444.269 --> 2449.279
Asian man what kind of is a little

2446.579 --> 2451.7400000000002
appealing about the whole idea of the

2449.279 --> 2455.46
military but it's probably not going to

2451.74 --> 2460.069
be turn out to be as good as as I

2455.46 --> 2460.069
imagine it is the the challenge of it I

2463.069 --> 2467.49
don't know could I even still do it you

2465.42 --> 2470.609
know in my condition I probably couldn't

2467.49 --> 2474.3799999999997
I wouldn't be sufficient I would be

2470.609 --> 2478.8289999999997
either too weak or too easily run down

2474.38 --> 2482.6400000000003
by their standards and all that I could

2478.829 --> 2490.529
be very tactical probably but as for

2482.64 --> 2492.5099999999998
physical in the field things I'm not

2490.529 --> 2496.23
saying I yeah it would be absolutely

2492.51 --> 2500.279
weak but I yeah when things get serious

2496.23 --> 2505.13
I would probably not be among the last

2500.279 --> 2505.13
standing maybe I don't know

2508.17 --> 2515.64
I have iff this is going so far away

2512.09 --> 2518.1600000000003
from where I am now I don't even know

2515.64 --> 2520.77
how to visualize that how that could be

2518.16 --> 2531.0899999999997
real in a way yeah it's not gonna happen

2520.77 --> 2531.87
not for a long time Oh God Lottie you're

2531.09 --> 2538.3500000000004
disgusting

2531.87 --> 2544.5
no also I don't have a bath here I have

2538.35 --> 2548.33
a shower and that's it yeah that's this

2544.5 --> 2550.65
crazy girl yeah I don't even want to

2548.33 --> 2553.13
direct that subject in here it's

2550.65 --> 2553.13
ridiculous

2568.35 --> 2577.3199999999997
okay right I don't know I'm just trying

2572.85 --> 2579.18
to be open-minded I'm look every time

2577.32 --> 2583.8300000000004
I'm always saying things can change

2579.18 --> 2586.5899999999997
around it it really can start it in my

2583.83 --> 2589.14
opinion feels like it's a possibility at

2586.59 --> 2591.9900000000002
this point no I think that joining the

2589.14 --> 2594.0899999999997
military would be a big mistake for me

2591.99 --> 2596.1299999999997
especially considering the whole

2594.09 --> 2601.38
political stance of the Netherlands in

2596.13 --> 2603.8900000000003
the whole geopolitical situation a very

2601.38 --> 2603.8900000000003
bad idea

2614.28 --> 2619.4
[Music]

2616.71 --> 2619.4
right

2623.25 --> 2632.21
right Karen B well I am considering I

2627.54 --> 2634.92
don't know in the direction somehow of

2632.21 --> 2642.2400000000002
construction and that's a very broad

2634.92 --> 2644.369
field also with more low tare jobs so I

2642.24 --> 2647.43
don't know this is just how men I'm

2644.369 --> 2649.4700000000003
imagining it and I think that it is a

2647.43 --> 2655.3489999999997
way that I could potentially even at

2649.47 --> 2657.1499999999996
this late age still just get in there

2655.349 --> 2660.2400000000002
somehow especially because I think that

2657.15 --> 2662.13
for some time though there have been

2660.24 --> 2665.609
more jobs for there's a lot of building

2662.13 --> 2668.4300000000003
ogon in the Netherlands so maybe I'm

2665.609 --> 2670.29
trying that's why I want to need more

2668.43 --> 2673.5299999999997
information about and not looking that

2670.29 --> 2677.34
through here so please don't start to

2673.53 --> 2679.9500000000003
act like my advisors on this I'm gonna

2677.34 --> 2683.31
get it through here electricians yeah

2679.95 --> 2685.0499999999997
but there's an issue with that

2683.31 --> 2688.7
Karen B and that is I don't like

2685.05 --> 2688.7000000000003
electricity too much

2700.36 --> 2705.67
but who knows at this point with

2703.72 --> 2710.68
everything I've learned I could probably

2705.67 --> 2712.51
do it once I overcome yeah kind of my

2710.68 --> 2714.79
nervousness in the face of electricity

2712.51 --> 2718.11
because I really don't like getting

2714.79 --> 2721.12
shocked like that I've really don't and

2718.11 --> 2723.52
it's like it nerves me somehow it's just

2721.12 --> 2725.2
very annoying so I don't see myself

2723.52 --> 2726.73
being very good at it but if I would

2725.2 --> 2730.02
manage to overcome that then I'd

2726.73 --> 2733.63
probably be come very good at it

2730.02 --> 2735.7599999999998
probably also quickly because I've

2733.63 --> 2738.58
already been exposed so much too much so

2735.76 --> 2740.23
much theory about it I already have the

2738.58 --> 2743.0499999999997
building blocks I just haven't really

2740.23 --> 2747.13
properly put it all together yet through

2743.05 --> 2749.02
practice but who knows it is among the

2747.13 --> 2751.69
construction as well so hey if it's

2749.02 --> 2754.75
gonna be like an option

2751.69 --> 2757.39
I might just join didn't do some of that

2754.75 --> 2759.85
and we'll see where I'd go from there I

2757.39 --> 2761.83
I just don't want to go out and

2759.85 --> 2764.68
speculate everything I'm gonna be doing

2761.83 --> 2766.99
before I get informed of what options

2764.68 --> 2772.66
really are might turn out to be that I

2766.99 --> 2775.3199999999997
just need need levels of paper that are

2772.66 --> 2779.5
gonna cost money that I don't have and

2775.32 --> 2782.98
then it can be a short-term startup plan

2779.5 --> 2787.36
so we'll just see I'm gonna get it

2782.98 --> 2790.56
formed what I'm thinking about that as a

2787.36 --> 2790.56
direction I could take

2800.94 --> 2807.2200000000003
yeah yeah yeah of church-like that's

2804.099 --> 2810.1600000000003
right yeah if you're an electrician in

2807.22 --> 2811.8999999999996
construction then you're in

2810.16 --> 2817.69
that's more like electrical

2811.9 --> 2820.23
installations installing electrics sure

2817.69 --> 2820.23
I could do that

2831.29 --> 2840.859
anyway this fine done with the subject

2836.9 --> 2848.78
for now just passing on what I'm

2840.859 --> 2851.0299999999997
thinking of in the background welding oh

2848.78 --> 2856.9100000000003
sure I could do welding I'm a goldsmith

2851.03 --> 2863.27
I can handle that kind of thing I think

2856.91 --> 2870.89
I weld at one time because somebody that

2863.27 --> 2873.71
had that equipment let me do it was it

2870.89 --> 2876.74
even it could have also been part of the

2873.71 --> 2880.25
my goldsmithing education if I don't

2876.74 --> 2888.08
remember exactly but sure welding a lot

2880.25 --> 2891.17
of welding I know right so I'm gonna

2888.08 --> 2893.33
change the subject now I don't want to

2891.17 --> 2895.94
continue talking about this thank you

2893.33 --> 2898.369
very much let's get back to some flat

2895.94 --> 2900.2000000000003
earth and not my freakin presumed career

2898.369 --> 2903.31
you're all trying to imagine for me

2900.2 --> 2903.31
thank you very much

2916.299 --> 2925.599

2962.349 --> 2970.15
a teenager over at my grandma's house or

2966.91 --> 2972.0389999999998

2970.15 --> 2973.779
with a lot of nettles around there and

2972.039 --> 2976.38
we used to make that soup as well was

2973.779 --> 2976.38
